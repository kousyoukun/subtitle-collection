1
00:01:39,152 --> 00:01:42,638
With purity in our hearts
with right thinking in our minds...

2
00:01:42,792 --> 00:01:46,591
we arm ourselves
with intolerance of all evil.

3
00:01:47,094 --> 00:01:50,101
So it is, on this glorious Sabbath morning...

4
00:01:50,558 --> 00:01:53,646
in this momentous year of 1887...

5
00:01:53,883 --> 00:01:57,387
we naturally turn our
thoughts towards that way of life...

6
00:01:57,417 --> 00:02:01,259
as exemplified by
Victoria, our beloved queen.

7
00:02:01,944 --> 00:02:06,496
For this week begins
Her Majesty's golden jubilee.

8
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:10,742
From her heart has
come an ever increasing flow...

9
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:13,315
of virtue and moral blessing.

10
00:02:13,497 --> 00:02:17,170
She came upon a world
sadly mired in the ways of the flesh.

11
00:02:17,674 --> 00:02:20,874
But during her reign, the
forces of good have achieved notable...

12
00:02:20,875 --> 00:02:23,726
- notable and great victories over the...
- Stop, stop.

13
00:02:23,974 --> 00:02:26,674
- What's wrong dear?
- Although we know not the time...

14
00:02:26,675 --> 00:02:29,714
nor the season we
know that in God's own time///

15
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:33,346
evil shall be wiped out by good.

16
00:02:33,376 --> 00:02:35,067
Evil wiped out, eh?

17
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,250
- And maybe not lived for the...
- You want to take all the fun out of life?

18
00:02:38,251 --> 00:02:41,255
Good old Beelzebub, the boy with the horn.

19
00:02:41,285 --> 00:02:45,202
Has taken root in a new
goodness during these decades.

20
00:02:45,381 --> 00:02:49,787
At the family hearth,
in the shops of industry that...

21
00:02:50,324 --> 00:02:52,534
That the world moves forward today.

22
00:02:54,951 --> 00:03:00,179
Blasphemy I call it, to talk
that way about a man's best friend.

23
00:03:03,252 --> 00:03:05,230
Blasphemy.

24
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,335
- Did Parker go for a constable?
- Yes.

25
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:10,908
- Hello.
- Hello guvnor.

26
00:03:10,938 --> 00:03:15,736
Say, you let me go back in there and I'll tell
them what a grown man really thinks about.

27
00:03:16,123 --> 00:03:19,198
- Is he been like this before?
- It's been getting worse since the explosion.

28
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:21,800
- Shock? Oh, I see.
- You're a full-blooded young fella.

29
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:22,546
You'll tell them.

30
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,630
- I thought if we go to church he'll...
- We know, don't we?

31
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,421
What's all the bats? What's going on in here?

32
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:37,748
- Drunk and disorderly.
- Now, wait a minute constable.

33
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:40,952
Just take him to Camden Hospital, will you?
Will you give that to Dr. Heath please?

34
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:43,403
Better take him to
the station sir, he's always...

35
00:03:43,404 --> 00:03:48,245
Oh, Dr. Jekyll. Bats is he?
Right sir, Camden Hospital it is Dr. Jekyll.

36
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:51,641
- All right me lovely, upsy-daisy.
- Dr. Jekyll, eh?

37
00:03:52,086 --> 00:03:56,984
Well, you go on Dr. Jekyll and try to put old
Belzebu in his bottomless pit, he'll show you.

38
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,883
Go back and be good Dr. Jekyll.

39
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:44,253
- I must go to the hospital sir.
- Hospital? On a Sunday?

40
00:04:44,254 --> 00:04:46,254
Oh, you mean that outrageous individual.

41
00:04:46,255 --> 00:04:49,255
Harry says the Providence
dropped the man right into his lap.

42
00:04:49,265 --> 00:04:53,415
- Well, but isn't this most unusual my boy?
- I'm sorry but it is sir, most unusual.

43
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:57,166
Oh, don't you dare be late
for the Marley dinner tonight.

44
00:04:57,167 --> 00:05:00,570
And let you have a free rein
with all those men, I should say not.

45
00:05:08,584 --> 00:05:11,034
You know, that's a silly
little hat you've got on.

46
00:05:11,035 --> 00:05:14,185
- I knew you'd like it.
- There isn't anything about you I like.

47
00:05:16,961 --> 00:05:18,058
All right Jenkins.

48
00:05:20,205 --> 00:05:21,205
Sorry.

49
00:05:23,595 --> 00:05:26,335
- My dear please.
- Oh, sorry father.

50
00:05:27,196 --> 00:05:31,446
My dear Beatrix, I'm a very broad minded man
but I do wish Harry wouldn't make such...

51
00:05:31,447 --> 00:05:35,424
demonstrations of affection in public
even if you are going to marry him.

52
00:05:35,454 --> 00:05:37,400
Now father darling, don't be pompous.

53
00:05:38,895 --> 00:05:41,228
Good heavens, nibbling your knuckles.

54
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:45,855
Tell them what a
grown man really thinks about it.

55
00:05:46,385 --> 00:05:49,218
I can't allow it,
it's a matter of ethics Jekyll.

56
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:52,455
- Please Dr. Jekyll, may I go in?
- No, not now, Mrs. Higgins.

57
00:05:52,546 --> 00:05:54,688
Bear up now, that's how you can help.

58
00:06:01,202 --> 00:06:03,688
Good heaven's man, it's
the greatest opportunity I've ever had.

59
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:05,407
The more I see at
the case, the more I realize it.

60
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:08,489
But you don't mind if we object,
you know how we all admire your work.

61
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:11,810
And possibly this case does come
within the scope of your research.

62
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:14,021
That's why I'd like to bow to your opinion.

63
00:06:14,495 --> 00:06:17,501
But as head of
the staff at this hospital I cannot...

64
00:06:23,622 --> 00:06:28,122
Listen Jekyll, tell me straight out,
what you think you could do for this man?

65
00:06:28,239 --> 00:06:30,111
- I might have a chance of curing him.
- A chance?

66
00:06:30,112 --> 00:06:31,915
Yes, I've been experimenting with animals.

67
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,893
Yeah, but what might works with
animals might not with a human being.

68
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:38,032
- Jekyll, your chemicals may be deadly.
- No, not one animal has died.

69
00:06:38,033 --> 00:06:41,733
But it might, now it's too dangerous,
you go too outside of known medicine.

70
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,734
- But I'm no witch doctor.
- Who's called you a witch doctor?

71
00:06:44,735 --> 00:06:47,285
You told me yourself
that it still had to be proved.

72
00:06:47,286 --> 00:06:49,877
I can't allow you to experiment with...

73
00:06:49,907 --> 00:06:53,557
. Why, after all the man's a human being.
You mean he was a human being.

74
00:06:53,677 --> 00:06:56,353
And he might be again, if you
keep your high bar ethics out of this.

75
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:58,050
Sometimes we have to gamble.

76
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:01,751
Or haven't you the courage to face
what might be the most daring...

77
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:05,802
Listen Jekyll, I wouldn't talk these
experiments around very openly if I were you.

78
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:09,732
You're dealing with things it would be
better not to mention for your own sake.

79
00:07:09,733 --> 00:07:11,850
- There might be trouble.
- Trouble?

80
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,662
Trouble...

81
00:07:19,402 --> 00:07:21,500
Harry old boy, there are rumors of...

82
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:22,779
What's the matter?

83
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,747
Don't worry John, the
bull is leaving the China shop.

84
00:07:24,748 --> 00:07:26,648
Now Harry, it can't be as bad as that.

85
00:07:26,649 --> 00:07:29,349
John my good friend,
I realize your Dr. Heath is right.

86
00:07:29,473 --> 00:07:32,222
After all, we doctors can't
experiment on human beings.

87
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:35,817
Something might go wrong and then the human
beings will no longer believe in our medicine.

88
00:07:35,818 --> 00:07:36,796
- Isn't that right?
- Now, look here.

89
00:07:36,797 --> 00:07:39,094
But when I get proof, ethics or no ethics.

90
00:07:39,095 --> 00:07:41,378
I want to be on hand, China or no China.

91
00:07:48,894 --> 00:07:52,216
Good afternoon sir,
just in time for tea, sir.

92
00:07:52,846 --> 00:07:54,596
I'll be bound you had no lunch sir.

93
00:07:55,285 --> 00:07:58,327
Now, what about some
nice, hot crumpets sir, eh?

94
00:07:59,448 --> 00:08:02,398
Of course, we mustn't spoil
our appetite for dinner tonight.

95
00:08:02,399 --> 00:08:05,299
Miss Beatrix would be
after me properly if we did that sir.

96
00:08:05,633 --> 00:08:11,214
And beside, Mrs. Marley's butler tells me that
their new cook is really first class sir.

97
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,318
Sir, what about your tea sir?

98
00:08:19,605 --> 00:08:21,429
Shall I serve it down there sir?

99
00:08:21,854 --> 00:08:25,086
Now look here sir, you
must've something, you know?

100
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:51,434
Mrs. Marley, my deepest apologies.

101
00:09:51,464 --> 00:09:54,184
You doctors, I know we can never rely on you.

102
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,930
You know, I don't mind being scolded
by the smartest hostess in London.

103
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:01,676
- Oh, Dr. Jekyll, do sit over there.
- Thank you, good evening.

104
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:05,928
Giles. Colonel.
My special apologies to you Lady Colburn.

105
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:06,958
Pleasurer.

106
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,013
Behaving yourself?

107
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,010
- A doctor's life, eh Harry?
- The more patients, the colder the soup, eh?

108
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:16,192
As a matter of fact, it wasn't the patient,

109
00:10:16,193 --> 00:10:18,048
I got started on something,
forgot to look at the clock.

110
00:10:18,049 --> 00:10:19,665
Oh, yes Jekyll.

111
00:10:19,991 --> 00:10:24,141
Heath was telling me that you're still
carrying on with that research work of yours.

112
00:10:24,142 --> 00:10:26,692
The great Dr. Heath
isn't in sympathy Dr. Courtland.

113
00:10:26,693 --> 00:10:28,293
That's understandable, isn't it?

114
00:10:28,387 --> 00:10:31,323
After all, separating the
facets of the brain.

115
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:33,759
Rather ambitious, I should call.

116
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,148
Harry's research hopes
go deeper than the brain sir.

117
00:10:36,149 --> 00:10:38,499
Into something more
intangible than the mind is.

118
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,592
- Then all that seems to be left is the soul.
- All right then, call it the soul.

119
00:10:42,622 --> 00:10:44,855
- The soul?
- Soul?

120
00:10:44,885 --> 00:10:48,217
Come, come my dear doctor,
now you're invading my territory.

121
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:50,998
Oh, I suppose I am,
but I know that you for one...

122
00:10:51,028 --> 00:10:53,933
wouldn't object if science could
be of some assistance to the church.

123
00:10:53,934 --> 00:10:56,855
The church is always
grateful for any help doctor.

124
00:10:56,885 --> 00:11:00,274
Of course, Harry doesn't mean a word of this
gentleman, I'm afraid he's pulling our leg.

125
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:04,716
I should hope so, I was wondering what
Jekyll would do if I asked him to elaborate.

126
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,199
I don't mind elaborating.

127
00:11:07,036 --> 00:11:10,586
Most of were in church this morning,
if you didn't see that poor chap...

128
00:11:10,587 --> 00:11:11,787
you heard him, I'm sure.

129
00:11:12,096 --> 00:11:14,246
Thank you for your assistance, Herr doctor.

130
00:11:14,247 --> 00:11:17,309
- Hopelessly insane, obviously.
- I don't think he was insane.

131
00:11:17,557 --> 00:11:20,673
I think there was only one side of him in
existence and that side was expressing itself.

132
00:11:20,674 --> 00:11:22,993
- Good heavens, which side?
- His evil side.

133
00:11:23,921 --> 00:11:26,521
The man had been
spiritually distorted through shock.

134
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:28,650
That explosion in the gas main last month.

135
00:11:29,126 --> 00:11:31,326
Before that, he was a fine, solid citizen...

136
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:34,789
gentle and kind with his
children, deeply in love with his wife.

137
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:37,020
Since then he'd undergone a complete change.

138
00:11:37,305 --> 00:11:40,605
Until this afternoon I found him
completely reverted to the animal.

139
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:44,120
But look here harry, we can clearly understand
the shock to the nervous system but...

140
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,821
what that got to do with the soul?

141
00:11:45,822 --> 00:11:49,893
Well, I think the man had been shock
from normal good into complete evil.

142
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:54,498
Now, when I say he was a good man I don't mean
he hadn't had a bad thought now and then.

143
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:58,027
Or that he hadn't committed
ordinary transgressions against society.

144
00:11:58,460 --> 00:12:01,810
But after all, that's the problem
of civilized man's soul, isn't it?

145
00:12:01,966 --> 00:12:04,966
That good and evil in it are
constantly fighting one another?

146
00:12:04,967 --> 00:12:08,768
There's a higher source from which
good can find aid in its fight doctor.

147
00:12:08,798 --> 00:12:10,048
I realize that sir but...

148
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:14,549
Of course, the colonel and I have always felt
that a person can be good if they wish to be.

149
00:12:14,551 --> 00:12:16,368
And well, otherwise if they don't.

150
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:19,365
Look at Jekyll,
I simply must get this straight.

151
00:12:19,708 --> 00:12:21,258
Well, let me put it this way...

152
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,104
good and evil are so close as to be
chained together in the soul.

153
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:28,667
Now, suppose we could break that
chain, separate those two selves.

154
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:33,073
Free the good in man and let it go on to
its higher destiny and segregate the bad.

155
00:12:33,234 --> 00:12:37,298
But aren't you a bit presumptuous
in assuming that there's evil in all men?

156
00:12:37,488 --> 00:12:39,086
Oh, but isn't that true?

157
00:12:39,656 --> 00:12:42,156
Wouldn't we be hypocrites
if we didn't admit that?

158
00:12:42,157 --> 00:12:46,432
After all, we've all had thoughts that we
didn't want published or shouted out loud...

159
00:12:46,462 --> 00:12:50,186
and we certainly have had desires
that are not confined to a drawing room.

160
00:12:50,216 --> 00:12:53,077
Why, as Christians
we admit that man is created weak.

161
00:12:53,379 --> 00:12:56,129
That's a perfectly honest
problem, why don't we face it?

162
00:12:56,130 --> 00:13:00,564
Suppose we believe that man's soul
has not yet reached its fulfillment.

163
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,030
Is it wise, is it right
to tamper with the problem...

164
00:13:04,387 --> 00:13:08,580
until the Creator himself has
solved it in his own mysterious way?

165
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,350
Sir I...

166
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,569
Really, is it very disturbing.
Such theories come dangerously close to...

167
00:13:14,088 --> 00:13:17,037
Well, I hesitate to think what the
medical council would be force to say...

168
00:13:17,038 --> 00:13:18,038
Dr. Courtland...

169
00:13:18,508 --> 00:13:22,105
advanced theories are always
a sore point with the medical council.

170
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:23,936
Or even with the queen's physician.

171
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,720
Specially, if there's a comfortable
profit in those already established.

172
00:13:27,721 --> 00:13:28,827
Jekyll?

173
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:33,200
If you ask my opinion
young man, this is pure balderdash.

174
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,932
- Ladies.
- I meant to ask...

175
00:13:36,076 --> 00:13:39,946
You think anyone read that poem
by this new chap Oscar Wilde?

176
00:14:03,254 --> 00:14:04,373
Getting old I suppose.

177
00:14:04,403 --> 00:14:06,541
Well, it's the time, I think
is pretty late, we ought to...

178
00:14:06,542 --> 00:14:08,792
No, no, no. Come in and have a nightcap John.

179
00:14:09,141 --> 00:14:12,191
I think the rest of the company
won't be bore with each other.

180
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:13,522
Well, thank you sir.

181
00:14:21,865 --> 00:14:22,867
Look.

182
00:14:47,938 --> 00:14:50,614
It's the waltz that he
and Mama first danced together.

183
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:04,538
- May I have this dance, Miss Beatrix?
- Pleasure Dr. Jekyll.

184
00:15:31,568 --> 00:15:34,599
- Bea, darling.
- Harry.

185
00:15:35,057 --> 00:15:36,933
I love you so very much Bea.

186
00:15:42,573 --> 00:15:43,830
Oh Harry.

187
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:50,843
Tonight at dinner, I understood what you
said about the good and evil in people...

188
00:15:51,066 --> 00:15:52,666
and how's that way in all of us.

189
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:54,274
But...

190
00:15:54,643 --> 00:15:55,788
Well, why isn't...?

191
00:15:56,082 --> 00:15:58,555
Why isn't the way you
and I feel about each other?

192
00:15:59,985 --> 00:16:02,887
I mean, there's
nothing evil in that, is there?

193
00:16:03,235 --> 00:16:06,783
- You think there is?
- No, no Harry.

194
00:16:07,118 --> 00:16:10,651
- Bea, we're in love, aren't we?
- Yes, we're very much in love.

195
00:16:10,681 --> 00:16:12,120
That's all the difference.

196
00:16:18,756 --> 00:16:21,561
Oh my dear, John is
looking for a piece of music...

197
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:24,141
The Banks of Loch Lomond,
will you help him find it?

198
00:16:24,142 --> 00:16:25,545
- Yes father.
- Thank you.

199
00:16:26,732 --> 00:16:28,108
Harry...

200
00:16:29,432 --> 00:16:33,632
I'm not one to brood about things but you
must've noticed my concern in the carriage.

201
00:16:33,633 --> 00:16:34,959
Why no sir, I just thought that...

202
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:39,110
That amazing flight of fancy you put forth
at dinner, I must confess it startled me.

203
00:16:39,262 --> 00:16:42,162
Although I'm broad-minded
myself it was a bit shocking too.

204
00:16:42,406 --> 00:16:46,103
I'm sorry to hear you say that sir, because
I assure you it was not a flight of fancy.

205
00:16:46,104 --> 00:16:48,092
You mean you actually were in honest?

206
00:16:48,329 --> 00:16:51,929
Profoundly sir, as a matter of fact
I'm hoping to spend all of my time...

207
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:54,009
- This is distressing Harry.
- Why?

208
00:16:54,377 --> 00:16:56,910
In my opinion the whole thing is harebrained.

209
00:16:57,172 --> 00:17:00,137
Well, I'm sorry
to hear you say that sir, I...

210
00:17:00,167 --> 00:17:03,217
You're a coming man in
your profession, I'm very proud of you.

211
00:17:03,698 --> 00:17:08,086
But these ridiculous experiments won't
get you anywhere, you must give them up.

212
00:17:08,734 --> 00:17:12,684
Develop your practice, cultivate the
circle in which you and Beatrix shall move.

213
00:17:12,685 --> 00:17:16,344
Harry my boy, I've always wanted
a son and now you're going to be that.

214
00:17:17,293 --> 00:17:20,543
Now, I've had my say.
Let's have your nightcap, it's getting late.

215
00:17:22,289 --> 00:17:25,839
And by the way, I've taken a box
for the opening concert at Albert Hall.

216
00:17:26,454 --> 00:17:27,754
You'll join us, of course.

217
00:17:32,987 --> 00:17:35,087
It's up, you and the old boy cross swords?

218
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:36,587
Yeap.

219
00:17:37,618 --> 00:17:39,512
Seems I must discontinue my research.

220
00:17:39,701 --> 00:17:43,301
Spend the rest of my life diagnosing
measles, mumps and whooping cough...

221
00:17:43,595 --> 00:17:45,466
or encounter his serious disapproval.

222
00:17:45,496 --> 00:17:47,196
I've been cut out of the draugh...

223
00:17:47,197 --> 00:17:50,062
even I was surprised when you took
a Marley dinner party into your confidence.

224
00:17:50,063 --> 00:17:52,898
Don't asking you to agree with
me, I just have a decision to make.

225
00:17:52,899 --> 00:17:55,699
Now look here Harry, you
and I've been friends for years.

226
00:17:55,735 --> 00:17:57,335
I can't agree with you theory...

227
00:17:57,336 --> 00:17:59,395
but that doesn't make any
difference to our friendship, you know.

228
00:17:59,396 --> 00:18:01,996
Let's drop into the
club, I rather whip, do you good.

229
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,697
Well, I'll walk that far with you.

230
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:12,487
Let me go, you thug. Let me go.

231
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:16,221
Help me, help me.

232
00:18:21,588 --> 00:18:23,096
Let him go, let him go.

233
00:18:24,618 --> 00:18:27,020
- You get a cab, I'll see what's happened.
- Yes.

234
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:35,256
A girl can't walk out
with a chap, who does he think he is?

235
00:18:35,870 --> 00:18:37,110
Think did he hurt you?

236
00:18:37,937 --> 00:18:40,137
It'll take more than a bloke like that to...

237
00:18:50,059 --> 00:18:53,540
Why, I bet I look ever so untidy.

238
00:18:54,421 --> 00:18:55,849
You sure you're not hurt?

239
00:18:56,343 --> 00:18:59,333
Why I, I don't think so.

240
00:19:04,579 --> 00:19:07,622
- What is it? Your ankle?
- Yeah, it's twisted.

241
00:19:09,479 --> 00:19:10,987
Oh, do you mind?

242
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,681
No, no.

243
00:19:14,711 --> 00:19:18,315
- After all, an ankle can be very painful.
- You are ever so kind.

244
00:19:20,745 --> 00:19:26,323
- Oh, me side too, he hit me.
- Oh well, I should've caught him.

245
00:19:26,494 --> 00:19:29,271
Oh no, no. I'm...

246
00:19:30,034 --> 00:19:34,570
I mean I, I'm so glad you
stopped, if you take my meaning.

247
00:19:39,027 --> 00:19:42,177
My friend is getting a cab,
perhaps we could drop you somewhere.

248
00:19:43,092 --> 00:19:46,092
- Oh, you're ever so kind.
- Shall we try it now?

249
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,215
There, that's a girl.

250
00:19:48,245 --> 00:19:51,195
Gentlemen like you shouldn't
be bothering yourself about me.

251
00:19:52,189 --> 00:19:55,389
Now, what sort of a gentleman
doesn't like to help a pretty girl?

252
00:19:56,759 --> 00:19:57,995
No.

253
00:19:58,836 --> 00:20:00,798
And me with me hat all over me head.

254
00:20:02,587 --> 00:20:05,510
So he asks me if he can
walk me home, he does.

255
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,166
Well, I turns around to him and I says yes.

256
00:20:08,819 --> 00:20:12,569
When a girl is out late, it's nice to
have a bit of company to see her home.

257
00:20:12,944 --> 00:20:13,944
Natural.

258
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:17,883
Well, I know what's what.

259
00:20:18,362 --> 00:20:20,312
Well, you have to if you are a barmaid.

260
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:24,910
Well, I like a bit of fun as the saying
goes but when a bloke grabs you...

261
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:28,619
sudden like with nasty notions in
his head it's time to put your foot down.

262
00:20:34,332 --> 00:20:37,959
I'm, I'm sorry to bother you gentlemen.

263
00:20:42,138 --> 00:20:43,806
Well, here we are.

264
00:20:52,656 --> 00:20:55,392
- Oh, it hurts more now.
- Oh, does it?

265
00:20:55,422 --> 00:20:56,660
Oh my...

266
00:20:58,956 --> 00:21:01,806
- Can I give a hand Harry?
- No, no, I think I can manage.

267
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:04,258
Oh, I'm so sorry.

268
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:06,908
- Good night.
- Good night.

269
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:12,170
Here?

270
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:26,437
The light is by the door,
if you have a match.

271
00:21:26,804 --> 00:21:27,804
Right.

272
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:42,847
You better let down your blouse.

273
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:45,539
Why?

274
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:48,551
Well, you want me to have
a look at you, don't you?

275
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:50,932
I don't know.

276
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:55,665
You are looking, ain't you?

277
00:21:58,912 --> 00:22:00,398
Well, how about your side?

278
00:22:03,619 --> 00:22:05,207
Do you want to look at my side?

279
00:22:06,199 --> 00:22:07,549
Well, don't you want me to?

280
00:22:24,993 --> 00:22:27,206
You aren't half a fast one, aren't you?

281
00:22:27,898 --> 00:22:30,448
I forgot to mention,
my friend and I are physicians.

282
00:22:32,079 --> 00:22:33,800
Physian, physicians?

283
00:22:35,475 --> 00:22:36,475
Doctors.

284
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:38,773
Doctors?

285
00:22:40,883 --> 00:22:42,497
Oh, go on.

286
00:22:44,274 --> 00:22:46,427
I thought you were a couple of toffs.

287
00:22:47,666 --> 00:22:50,057
No, no. Haven't the leisure.

288
00:22:50,263 --> 00:22:54,338
Oh, dear me and here I thought...

289
00:23:04,035 --> 00:23:06,285
Well, I'm glad to see you're not really hurt.

290
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:07,696
Oh, but I am doctor.

291
00:23:07,757 --> 00:23:08,757
Really.

292
00:23:08,758 --> 00:23:10,958
Maybe I better send you to the hospital, eh?

293
00:23:10,959 --> 00:23:11,769
No.

294
00:23:11,886 --> 00:23:14,085
Look. Here. Feel.

295
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:16,430
- Feel.
- Where? Here?

296
00:23:20,450 --> 00:23:22,380
Just as I thought, Cirrhosis pectoris.

297
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:24,870
What's that mean?

298
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:28,886
That means your eyes
are twin pools of desire.

299
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,687
Oh, doctor.

300
00:23:33,862 --> 00:23:35,432
That's nice.

301
00:23:36,233 --> 00:23:38,753
The things you do say.

302
00:23:40,698 --> 00:23:42,198
That doesn't hurt anymore, eh?

303
00:23:43,477 --> 00:23:44,477
Oh, yes.

304
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:47,617
- Yes.
- You'll be all right in the morning.

305
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:49,351
Wait.

306
00:23:50,491 --> 00:23:51,491
Wait.

307
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,749
My ankle.

308
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,180
Don't you think you ought to look at that?

309
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:08,010
No. No, your ankle is all right.

310
00:24:09,789 --> 00:24:13,730
But I'll tell you one thing, you
you wear your garter too tight.

311
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:16,417
That, that stops the circulation, that's bad.

312
00:24:16,418 --> 00:24:20,110
There, you see? You did find something.

313
00:24:20,608 --> 00:24:22,733
You are my doctor, aren't you?

314
00:24:24,019 --> 00:24:25,866
I ought to pay your fee, oughtn't I?

315
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:29,330
I haven't presented you with a bill yet.

316
00:24:32,067 --> 00:24:35,457
How about this to begin with?

317
00:24:36,511 --> 00:24:39,932
- Not that it's enough.
- It's fine, it's fine.

318
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:42,163
It's much more than most people pay.

319
00:24:44,037 --> 00:24:46,008
Doesn't seem near enough to me.

320
00:24:52,037 --> 00:24:53,247
Harry, listen...

321
00:24:54,178 --> 00:24:55,218
Oh, sorry.

322
00:24:56,806 --> 00:24:58,806
Come along, will you? It's getting late.

323
00:25:01,703 --> 00:25:02,921
Well...

324
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:05,221
But...

325
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:09,049
Oh, but you aren't really
going just because he says?

326
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,729
No, no, no, but I have to go now.

327
00:25:11,752 --> 00:25:13,552
But look here, don't you understand?

328
00:25:14,384 --> 00:25:15,419
I ain't no...

329
00:25:17,163 --> 00:25:18,163
I ain't no...

330
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,338
No, I know you're not.

331
00:25:21,238 --> 00:25:23,183
You're a girl with her
heart just where it ought to be...

332
00:25:23,184 --> 00:25:25,184
maybe a little too generous, that's all.

333
00:25:25,443 --> 00:25:27,443
So because you're a nice, pretty girl...

334
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:31,394
next time be a little more careful about
the company you pick, whatever why not?

335
00:25:31,395 --> 00:25:32,395
Well, but...

336
00:25:32,783 --> 00:25:34,183
But you are here, ain't you?

337
00:25:35,846 --> 00:25:37,203
Yes, but I shouldn't be.

338
00:25:37,868 --> 00:25:40,918
And if you really knew me,
you'd know I don't want to be here.

339
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:43,274
Well, I...

340
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:46,749
I picks only them as wants my company.

341
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:49,821
- I'm sorry, was my fault.
- What you sorry about?

342
00:25:50,786 --> 00:25:51,786
I am not.

343
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:56,269
Well then let's just
for-say that we were foolish...

344
00:25:56,270 --> 00:25:59,920
and the next time we'll have drink
will drink to one another's health, eh?

345
00:25:59,921 --> 00:26:02,171
Suppose it was all in fun when you kissed me.

346
00:26:03,418 --> 00:26:04,418
Yes.

347
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:07,942
It wasn't all in fun then, I know that.

348
00:26:21,352 --> 00:26:23,719
Well, goodbye and good luck.

349
00:26:46,115 --> 00:26:47,875
Oh, come on John, don't be stuffy.

350
00:26:48,503 --> 00:26:51,853
After all, the lady wasn't injured
and neither was I or anyone else.

351
00:26:51,854 --> 00:26:54,877
I imagine she might be a
tempting morsel in an off moment.

352
00:26:54,977 --> 00:26:58,227
- What do you mean, off moment?
- Yours, according to your theory.

353
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:02,293
I imagine that graphic kiss I just
witnessed was the momentary triumph...

354
00:27:02,294 --> 00:27:04,844
of the evil in your soul
over the good, eh? Correct?

355
00:27:04,845 --> 00:27:09,378
Yes, yes, I don't think it
was a triumph but it was an attack.

356
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:14,459
But one which would've been repulsed
even without your help John, I assure you.

357
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,110
Don't you think you'd
run less personal risk if you...

358
00:27:17,111 --> 00:27:19,108
confine your experiments to laboratory?

359
00:27:20,285 --> 00:27:25,203
That's where you'll find me from
tonight on until I get what I'm looking for.

360
00:28:55,122 --> 00:28:57,807
I'm worried John,
he ought to have let us know.

361
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,780
He'll be along.

362
00:29:31,090 --> 00:29:33,085
Maybe is all for the best Dr. Jekyll.

363
00:29:34,509 --> 00:29:36,246
That wasn't my son in there.

364
00:29:36,276 --> 00:29:40,096
It was as if the evil one had
crept into his heart, my poor Sam.

365
00:29:41,672 --> 00:29:44,917
- Burke, take Mrs. Higgins home.
- Yes sir, I walk her.

366
00:29:44,947 --> 00:29:46,934
Oh, thank you Dr. Jekyll.

367
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:49,431
- Thank you.
- Good night, Mrs. Higgins.

368
00:29:49,461 --> 00:29:52,396
Good night doctor, good night.

369
00:29:56,968 --> 00:29:59,868
- Hello Dr. Jekyll, how are you?
- Good evening Mr. Weller.

370
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,144
Just in time sir, just locking up.

371
00:30:05,322 --> 00:30:08,172
You wait half a moment
until I fix this thing over here...

372
00:30:08,173 --> 00:30:10,123
I'll walk up to the east gate with you.

373
00:30:11,449 --> 00:30:13,237
Wonderful nights we're having sir.

374
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:16,179
And don't you believe
a word about this here comet...

375
00:30:16,203 --> 00:30:20,603
and the world coming to an end business. If
you ask me it don't amount to a row of beans.

376
00:30:20,604 --> 00:30:23,908
Newspaper talk, that's what
I calls it, don't you believe it sir.

377
00:30:23,970 --> 00:30:27,037
Just step down to Lloyd's
and take out an insurance policy...

378
00:30:27,428 --> 00:30:31,828
and it won't cost you any more than it did
last week when there was no talk of a comet...

379
00:30:31,829 --> 00:30:33,333
or the world running into one.

380
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:36,900
And those are the fellows that
know what they're talking about sir...

381
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,001
you take that from me.

382
00:30:38,133 --> 00:30:39,483
Mr. Weller, here's a point.

383
00:30:39,741 --> 00:30:43,891
If you had a balloon that could carried
a man to Mars and the pilot you're picked...

384
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:47,631
suddenly disappeared, would you
get in the balloon yourself and cast off?

385
00:30:47,678 --> 00:30:48,750
A balloon?

386
00:30:49,242 --> 00:30:51,964
Oh, that's a good
one sir, I think you got me there.

387
00:30:52,127 --> 00:30:55,575
I don't know though, if I'd
a balloon that take me there...

388
00:30:55,878 --> 00:30:59,094
and back mind you, I don't know
that I wouldn't have a go at it.

389
00:30:59,723 --> 00:31:02,273
Might get me away
from me mother in law for a while.

390
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,785
How's that for an answer Dr. Jekyll?

391
00:31:06,167 --> 00:31:08,617
Fair enough Mr. Weller, fair enough.

392
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:37,612
Yes? What?

393
00:31:45,917 --> 00:31:47,121
Oh, no.

394
00:35:40,528 --> 00:35:42,434
Can this be evil, eh?

395
00:35:48,108 --> 00:35:49,326
Dr. Jekyll.

396
00:35:51,350 --> 00:35:52,513
Dr. Jekyll?

397
00:35:52,974 --> 00:35:56,771
- What's happening sir? Are you all right?
- What is it? What you want?

398
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:59,656
- Is that you, Dr. Jekyll?
- Now wait a minute.

399
00:36:01,011 --> 00:36:02,284
Wait a minute Poole.

400
00:36:08,455 --> 00:36:11,479
Dr. Jekyll, who is that in there?

401
00:36:17,390 --> 00:36:19,005
Dr. Jekyll, answer me sir.

402
00:36:51,777 --> 00:36:52,777
Yes, Poole?

403
00:36:53,689 --> 00:36:55,544
I'm sorry sir, but I...

404
00:36:55,705 --> 00:36:59,655
I heard an odd noise and a strange voice.
I thought something was happening sir.

405
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,300
No, no, no. It's quite all right Poole...

406
00:37:02,642 --> 00:37:07,280
there was someone
here, a friend of mine. A Mr. Hyde.

407
00:37:07,704 --> 00:37:11,590
- I, I let him out, back door.
- Oh, I see sir, very good sir.

408
00:37:13,602 --> 00:37:18,733
Miss Beatrix is here sir, I showed her into the
consulting room sir. Hope I did right sir.

409
00:37:19,668 --> 00:37:21,703
Yes, yes, that was quite right Poole.

410
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:26,891
Tell Miss Beatrix
I should be there immediately.

411
00:37:27,194 --> 00:37:28,329
Very good, sir.

412
00:38:25,949 --> 00:38:27,043
Harry.

413
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:32,807
What you doing here Bea?

414
00:38:32,968 --> 00:38:36,786
- Oh, Harry, then you're not...
- Not what?

415
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:40,179
Oh, I don't know.

416
00:38:41,034 --> 00:38:44,406
- I'd the strangest feeling, I thought...
- Yes, you thought?

417
00:38:46,062 --> 00:38:50,263
That you were going away
without ever seeing me again.

418
00:38:51,404 --> 00:38:54,611
Well, why would
I do that Bea? I love you. Why...

419
00:38:54,805 --> 00:38:57,938
Oh, I know, but I
lost you for a moment Harry.

420
00:38:58,253 --> 00:39:00,757
- I was afraid.
- But you're not afraid now?

421
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:03,017
Of course not.

422
00:39:03,182 --> 00:39:06,732
Well, you see that everything
is all right, nothing is happened but I...

423
00:39:06,873 --> 00:39:10,719
- I'm the same as I ever was?
- Of course.

424
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:14,659
- Must've been a dream.
- Yes, yes, dream.

425
00:39:15,087 --> 00:39:17,984
- You're not angry with me?
- Angry?

426
00:39:19,996 --> 00:39:22,830
Oh, I don't want you to leave me, ever.

427
00:39:23,006 --> 00:39:26,276
- Oh darling.
- I love you so much.

428
00:39:26,769 --> 00:39:29,000
- Please don't send me away.
- No.

429
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,058
Yes, father?

430
00:39:44,283 --> 00:39:48,233
A good thing I was worried about your
behavior tonight, I couldn't sleep myself.

431
00:39:48,607 --> 00:39:52,096
Sir Charles, I know that's strange
for you to find Beatrix here but...

432
00:39:52,301 --> 00:39:53,422
I want you to believe that...

433
00:39:53,423 --> 00:39:56,145
All I can believe is that
your ideas are not normal Jekyll.

434
00:39:56,146 --> 00:39:58,046
- Not fit, not even...
- Sir Charles...

435
00:39:58,047 --> 00:40:00,517
I asked Beatrix to come
here tonight because...

436
00:40:00,547 --> 00:40:01,547
No, Harry.

437
00:40:01,974 --> 00:40:06,618
Father, I know my being here is
difficult to understand but I'm not ashamed.

438
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:10,224
Then my dear I shall
be for you, because I do understand.

439
00:40:11,288 --> 00:40:14,438
We leave for the Continent
tomorrow on the afternoon boat train.

440
00:40:14,439 --> 00:40:16,089
- The continent?
- Father, please.

441
00:40:16,090 --> 00:40:17,559
Oh, come Sir Charles.

442
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:19,360
After all, you could eliminate...

443
00:40:19,361 --> 00:40:22,105
all this difficulty if you'd
set an early date for our marriage.

444
00:40:22,106 --> 00:40:25,702
You don't seem to understand sir, we're
very much in love, we want to be together.

445
00:40:25,703 --> 00:40:28,303
- We don't want to wait any longer.
- Please, father.

446
00:40:28,304 --> 00:40:31,563
In view of what is happened tonight I
believe the engagement should be broken off.

447
00:40:31,564 --> 00:40:32,814
However, I'll be lenient.

448
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:34,783
We shall see you on our return.

449
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:38,323
- Come my dear.
- Father, I never disobeyed you in my life.

450
00:40:40,285 --> 00:40:42,498
But Harry, if you don't want me to leave...

451
00:40:43,298 --> 00:40:44,459
I'll refuse.

452
00:40:44,829 --> 00:40:47,165
- Beatrix.
- I mean it father.

453
00:40:50,846 --> 00:40:52,587
I don't want you to go, Bea...

454
00:40:53,157 --> 00:40:55,757
and I can't agree with
your father's decision but I..

455
00:40:55,863 --> 00:40:58,413
I do know that he's
thinking only in your happiness.

456
00:40:58,459 --> 00:41:00,924
I can't argue against
that and I can't ask you to.

457
00:41:01,344 --> 00:41:02,944
That's highly commendable Harry.

458
00:41:05,345 --> 00:41:07,444
Will you see us off at the train?

459
00:41:08,911 --> 00:41:11,511
Better have two engines,
I might try to hold it back.

460
00:41:13,378 --> 00:41:15,474
Try, try anyway.

461
00:41:40,726 --> 00:41:44,758
- A glass of sherry wine sir?
- No, no thank you.

462
00:41:44,903 --> 00:41:47,925
Well, would you consider
a letter from Monte Carlo sir?

463
00:41:51,752 --> 00:41:54,159
- I'll take the sherry wine too.
- Yes sir.

464
00:41:56,186 --> 00:41:59,436
Miss Beatrix should be returning
home soon now, shouldn't she sir?

465
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:00,590
Yes, yes Poole.

466
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:04,939
Hobson was telling me
that they were expected.

467
00:42:26,653 --> 00:42:27,653
Bad news sir?

468
00:42:29,102 --> 00:42:31,802
Miss Beatrix and her father
are going to Aix-Les-Bains.

469
00:42:33,248 --> 00:42:36,875
Oh, I'm sorry sir.
Sir Charles' health, no doubt.

470
00:42:37,775 --> 00:42:38,775
Yes, yes.

471
00:42:40,112 --> 00:42:42,265
Yes, sir Charles' health, no doubt.

472
00:42:50,097 --> 00:42:54,206
If you'll forgive me sir,
it upsets me to see you like this.

473
00:42:54,706 --> 00:42:58,631
It isn't right.
All work, as the saying goes sir.

474
00:42:59,986 --> 00:43:04,076
They say there's a very interesting
musical show at the vanity fair sir.

475
00:43:04,591 --> 00:43:06,684
Very comical, you know sir.

476
00:43:06,815 --> 00:43:11,285
And very daring if you follow my meaning.

477
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,949
Yeah, I follow your meaning Poole.

478
00:43:17,334 --> 00:43:20,674
But I don't think it would
be wise, even though it is comical.

479
00:43:21,655 --> 00:43:22,810
Quite so sir.

480
00:43:23,116 --> 00:43:25,965
- I'll fetch you another glass sir.
- Oh, never mind.

481
00:45:57,061 --> 00:45:59,346
Thanks for the pay sir. Hey, hey, hey.

482
00:46:01,713 --> 00:46:05,886
Here, what's the idea guvnor?
Oh, I beg your pardon sir.

483
00:46:17,243 --> 00:46:18,243
Yes, sir?

484
00:46:19,268 --> 00:46:21,800
Box F sir, right this way.

485
00:46:52,568 --> 00:46:55,441
Now, all together, boys.

486
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:24,423
Two pints.

487
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,620
A tip, a tip of course.

488
00:48:04,163 --> 00:48:05,903
Seven shillings sir? Why...

489
00:48:06,313 --> 00:48:09,938
- Why not? You work hard, don't you?
- Yes sir, bless you sir.

490
00:48:09,947 --> 00:48:13,842
- You have a family, no doubt.
- Yes, yes sir, thanks.

491
00:48:16,485 --> 00:48:18,985
- Did you hurt yourself friend?
- Hey, what the...?

492
00:48:18,986 --> 00:48:20,141
Oh, what a pity.

493
00:48:20,590 --> 00:48:22,890
You were thinking
of the children no doubt, eh?

494
00:48:23,164 --> 00:48:25,666
Now, have that girl in the
barmaid bring me some champagne.

495
00:48:25,667 --> 00:48:29,858
- Ivy ain't allowed to leave the bar.
- I don't think you understood what I said.

496
00:48:29,888 --> 00:48:33,194
- What's all this here?
- This gent here wants champagne sir.

497
00:48:33,224 --> 00:48:35,677
Champagne?
All right, then, bring it, bring it.

498
00:48:35,707 --> 00:48:39,262
- But he wants Ivy to serve it.
- Of course Ivy will serve it. Go on.

499
00:48:39,292 --> 00:48:40,292
Look lively.

500
00:48:42,732 --> 00:48:47,074
A gent in box F would want you to serve
him and Old Prouty says you're to do it.

501
00:48:47,075 --> 00:48:49,425
He does, eh?
I'll tell him it ain't my business.

502
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,272
But he wants a bottle of the boil.

503
00:48:51,394 --> 00:48:54,761
Oh bubbly, why didn't you get say so?

504
00:48:54,851 --> 00:48:58,819
Hey Ivy, Ivy me love, how about
some fish and chips after the show?

505
00:48:58,953 --> 00:49:02,416
- How about a dozen oysters, a pint of stout?
- No.

506
00:49:04,534 --> 00:49:06,385
Oh, what about a glass of champagne?

507
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,718
- Oh, hello, Marcia.
- Hello, Ivy.

508
00:49:14,568 --> 00:49:15,568
Watch out Ivy.

509
00:49:15,759 --> 00:49:16,759
How's about it Ivy?

510
00:49:18,073 --> 00:49:19,293
Over there Ivy.

511
00:49:19,847 --> 00:49:21,404
Ain't she a bit of horseflesh?

512
00:49:54,413 --> 00:49:57,711
Well then, that be half a quid sir.

513
00:49:58,788 --> 00:49:59,788
Half a quid?

514
00:50:00,108 --> 00:50:01,265
Yes, sir.

515
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:03,966
Half a quid.

516
00:50:04,873 --> 00:50:05,873
Here.

517
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:09,238
Here's a sovereign my dear, keep the change.

518
00:50:10,032 --> 00:50:11,099
Thank you sir.

519
00:50:12,673 --> 00:50:15,478
Oh, but you're not going? No, no, no.

520
00:50:16,504 --> 00:50:18,817
After all, you brought two glasses.

521
00:50:19,146 --> 00:50:23,346
Two minds with but a single thought.
My, what a nice beginning.

522
00:50:23,524 --> 00:50:25,933
Sit down there, sit right down.

523
00:50:26,836 --> 00:50:27,999
Well I...

524
00:50:29,477 --> 00:50:31,481
Well I, I'll just take a sip.

525
00:50:31,511 --> 00:50:34,711
- Of course, I shouldn't stay too long.
- Oh, nonsense. Nonsense.

526
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:36,983
You can stay as long as you like.

527
00:50:37,013 --> 00:50:39,163
After all, we have all evening, haven't we?

528
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:41,544
Of course we have, here.

529
00:50:42,694 --> 00:50:43,694
There are you.

530
00:50:44,843 --> 00:50:46,731
Oh, I like your singing.

531
00:50:47,168 --> 00:50:50,028
Yes, you must sing again for me sometime.

532
00:50:51,191 --> 00:50:53,325
Where did you get such a pretty voice?

533
00:50:59,168 --> 00:51:01,152
Well I, I don't know.

534
00:51:01,575 --> 00:51:04,425
- I just...
- Perhaps it's the pretty place it comes from?

535
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:08,591
- Well...
- Very lovely, where it comes from.

536
00:51:08,813 --> 00:51:12,781
- Well, here's health so good luck.
- I make my own luck my dear.

537
00:51:13,356 --> 00:51:16,441
Yes, and tonight,
tonight I'd follow the rainbow.

538
00:51:20,526 --> 00:51:22,469
Oh, you don't half talk, do you?

539
00:51:23,331 --> 00:51:25,331
Perhaps we could follow it together, eh?

540
00:51:25,562 --> 00:51:28,545
- I'll follow it right home mister.
- To that rat trap?

541
00:51:29,571 --> 00:51:33,730
- Hey, what are you calling names?
- Well, I think you deserve something better.

542
00:51:35,084 --> 00:51:39,203
- How do you know where I live?
- Well I, I can imagine.

543
00:51:39,777 --> 00:51:43,458
Surely your wages here don't, don't
earn you a place in Barkley Square.

544
00:51:48,836 --> 00:51:50,327
Well, I think I'll be off.

545
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:54,364
Why? I don't confuse you, do I Ivy?

546
00:51:56,280 --> 00:52:01,083
- I believe I do confuse you, don't I?
- I ain't confused by nobody.

547
00:52:03,054 --> 00:52:04,614
Let go, you hear?

548
00:52:13,152 --> 00:52:14,274
Let go.

549
00:52:20,965 --> 00:52:22,073
Let go, you hear?

550
00:52:22,457 --> 00:52:24,633
- What's he doing Ivy?
- Oh, you let go too.

551
00:52:25,221 --> 00:52:26,316
What happened Ivy?

552
00:52:27,766 --> 00:52:31,216
- Hear, hear., what's this all about?
- It's him, he, he insulted her.

553
00:52:31,217 --> 00:52:33,961
- He's lying, I tell you.
- He tried to break her arm.

554
00:52:33,991 --> 00:52:36,596
- He did, did he?
- Yes, yes, tried to break her arm.

555
00:52:37,239 --> 00:52:39,524
You will, eh? You want another one?

556
00:52:45,914 --> 00:52:48,706
No, no, stop it, stop it.

557
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:50,607
I'll stop it sir.

558
00:52:50,637 --> 00:52:54,301
Hey boys, now boys, boys, will you...?

559
00:53:12,581 --> 00:53:16,904
Oh, I can't understand what happened,
never a rumpus here. Most orderly.

560
00:53:17,971 --> 00:53:19,036
It's that girl...

561
00:53:19,066 --> 00:53:23,316
Ivy, that barmaid, pretty girls always cause
trouble, I'd throw her out if I were you.

562
00:53:23,317 --> 00:53:25,548
What, Ivy? I can't do that to Ivy.

563
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:28,439
A great man can always change his mind...

564
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:30,778
for a reason.

565
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:33,909
Yes sir, why certainly sir, yes sir.

566
00:53:33,939 --> 00:53:36,566
A troublemaker,
that's what she is, out she go.

567
00:53:36,758 --> 00:53:39,258
Yes, but now, now
while the evening is still young.

568
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:42,322
- Yes sir, certainly sir.
- Yes certainly.

569
00:53:44,503 --> 00:53:48,353
What happened? I ain't done nothing.
Just minding my own business, that's all.

570
00:53:48,383 --> 00:53:50,822
- That's my decision my girl.
- Oh, stop pushing.

571
00:53:50,852 --> 00:53:52,167
Don't hang about here.

572
00:53:52,197 --> 00:53:55,597
- Who's hanging about?
- Go on, don't argue the point, good riddance.

573
00:53:58,077 --> 00:53:59,528
What's happened in there?

574
00:54:04,331 --> 00:54:07,707
- Is there some trouble Ivy?
- Trouble? I was sacked, that's what.

575
00:54:07,737 --> 00:54:10,189
How fortunate I'm here, I'd like to help you.

576
00:54:10,201 --> 00:54:13,751
Oh, just let me back in there so I
can bash him on the nose, that's all.

577
00:54:14,308 --> 00:54:18,562
Quite the little Tartar, aren't you?
Always ready to flare up. Oh, I like that.

578
00:54:19,699 --> 00:54:23,465
Here, here, this, this is just
to prove that, that I want to help you.

579
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:42,377
The rainbow is wide and long, Ivy.

580
00:54:43,842 --> 00:54:46,242
- Oh now wait I, I better get home.
- No, no, no.

581
00:54:51,332 --> 00:54:54,222
Ivy, my darling,
you belong with the immortals.

582
00:54:54,469 --> 00:54:57,769
Come with me to Mount
Olympus, drink nectar with the gods.

583
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:02,138
Sing the ancient songs of pleasure
and put Athena and Diana to shame.

584
00:55:05,815 --> 00:55:08,841
Oh, you aren't half of one
with the words, aren't you?

585
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:12,228
And don't be frightened of me, will you Ivy?

586
00:55:12,258 --> 00:55:16,127
When a botanist finds a rare flower,
he shouts his triumph, doesn't he?

587
00:55:17,948 --> 00:55:19,345
Are you one of them?

588
00:55:20,179 --> 00:55:24,589
You, you like a man who sees a girl
and makes up his mind, don't you?

589
00:55:26,054 --> 00:55:28,004
I don't know what you're talking about.

590
00:55:29,150 --> 00:55:32,217
Oh, she does know what I'm talking about.

591
00:55:36,928 --> 00:55:39,621
- Please sir.
- But you'll find out, won't you?

592
00:55:39,651 --> 00:55:42,117
- Please.
- You'll find out what it means.

593
00:55:42,925 --> 00:55:43,937
Please sir.

594
00:55:49,485 --> 00:55:52,224
- The London Post Sir Charles.
- Oh, thank you.

595
00:55:52,813 --> 00:55:54,263
And one for you mademoiselle.

596
00:56:13,546 --> 00:56:15,946
What does Harry have
to say this morning my dear?

597
00:56:16,970 --> 00:56:21,777
- I said, what does Harry say this morning?
- Oh, nothing much.

598
00:56:21,941 --> 00:56:24,995
I'll wager my gout hurts
him more than it does me, eh?

599
00:56:25,025 --> 00:56:27,241
Does he send any news I'd be allow to hear?

600
00:56:28,049 --> 00:56:31,787
Oh, he just said that he walked
through the East End recently.

601
00:56:34,704 --> 00:56:37,401
I've never seen such
deplorable housing conditions.

602
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:40,537
Surely the city fathers
should find the funds to...

603
00:56:41,947 --> 00:56:45,069
Well, then he just goes on
to say about the housing conditions.

604
00:56:45,946 --> 00:56:47,396
They must be pretty dreadful.

605
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:52,254
Yes, he's quite right. They're disgraceful.
I was just saying at the club before I left.

606
00:56:52,396 --> 00:56:55,066
Now, there's a problem
Harry could get his teeth into.

607
00:56:55,805 --> 00:56:57,311
He's just the man to...

608
00:56:57,831 --> 00:56:59,625
Here, here my dear, what's wrong?

609
00:57:00,241 --> 00:57:04,637
Nothing. I suppose I'm just not
very interested in housing conditions...

610
00:57:04,667 --> 00:57:06,280
at the moment.

611
00:57:07,129 --> 00:57:10,679
You mean because a man doesn't cover
the pages with sentiment? Nonsense.

612
00:57:10,963 --> 00:57:13,563
A woman must learn to read
between the lines my dear.

613
00:57:14,551 --> 00:57:16,851
Yes, I like the tone of that letter.

614
00:57:17,577 --> 00:57:21,277
And what's more my dear, I think my
gout is getting very, very much better.

615
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:54,458
- Oh, hello Marcia.
- Are you here alone?

616
00:57:55,126 --> 00:57:58,468
Yes, yes. I just made
some tea, come and have a cup.

617
00:57:58,498 --> 00:58:02,878
Not me nor you either. We ain't got time.
You're going get dressed, we're going out.

618
00:58:02,908 --> 00:58:04,408
Freddie got a young brother...

619
00:58:04,409 --> 00:58:07,809
just out from Oxford and they
want another girl to make it a quartet.

620
00:58:08,835 --> 00:58:12,314
He's a bit of all right too.
And we're going to the Empire.

621
00:58:12,805 --> 00:58:13,805
The empire?

622
00:58:13,806 --> 00:58:18,928
Yes, it's ever so gay there Ivy and the show
is grand, it's just where all the toffs go.

623
00:58:22,558 --> 00:58:25,831
- No, I don't think so Marcia.
- Why not?

624
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:28,360
Well, I just don't feel like it, that's all.

625
00:58:28,855 --> 00:58:30,499
You ain't afraid to go, are you?

626
00:58:31,526 --> 00:58:32,526
Afraid?

627
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:37,222
- Why should I be afraid?
- Oh, I don't know.

628
00:58:38,057 --> 00:58:39,057
I just thought...

629
00:58:39,687 --> 00:58:41,289
Well, I ain't afraid of nobody.

630
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:43,917
But you ain't been out
for ever so long, have you?

631
00:58:44,302 --> 00:58:46,852
- No, but...
- He ain't your lord and master, is he?

632
00:58:47,629 --> 00:58:48,729
I should say he ain't.

633
00:58:48,730 --> 00:58:51,230
Or is it because you ain't
got a nice enough dress?

634
00:58:55,563 --> 00:58:58,513
- Of course I have.
- What are you standing there for, then?

635
00:58:58,514 --> 00:58:59,514
Go and put it on.

636
00:59:02,008 --> 00:59:03,008
All right.

637
00:59:06,944 --> 00:59:08,570
What's that across your back?

638
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:12,665
What? There's nothing.

639
00:59:15,821 --> 00:59:17,034
Did he do that to you?

640
00:59:18,043 --> 00:59:20,280
- Let me see.
- No, no.

641
00:59:21,170 --> 00:59:22,460
It ain't nothing.

642
00:59:23,631 --> 00:59:25,986
- I just...
- So that's your fine friend, is it?

643
00:59:26,016 --> 00:59:27,424
The dirty, filthy brute.

644
00:59:27,732 --> 00:59:30,332
If ever a man dare
lay a hand to me like that, I'd...

645
00:59:34,134 --> 00:59:35,134
Well...

646
00:59:36,307 --> 00:59:39,596
Aren't you going to introduce
me to our charming visitor?

647
00:59:42,886 --> 00:59:44,187
It's Marcia.

648
00:59:45,405 --> 00:59:47,925
This is my friend Mr. Hyde.

649
00:59:48,597 --> 00:59:50,847
You've heard me speak about him, haven't you?

650
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:54,800
Oh yes Marcia,
I've heard a great deal about you.

651
00:59:55,538 --> 00:59:58,879
I've never been interested, until now.

652
00:59:59,578 --> 01:00:01,413
I've got to be toddling along now.

653
01:00:05,713 --> 01:00:09,712
- Toodle-loo Ivy.
- Oh, no, no. Don't go now, Marcia.

654
01:00:10,122 --> 01:00:14,286
After all, this could be very interesting,
the three of us in friendly discussion.

655
01:00:15,340 --> 01:00:18,256
I can't keep my friend
waiting, I'll be dropping by Ivy.

656
01:00:18,286 --> 01:00:19,756
Yes, yes, yes.

657
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:23,892
Drop by sometime when I'm here Marcia.

658
01:00:25,083 --> 01:00:26,899
Your ideas differ from mine.

659
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:30,995
It would be a charming
experience to change them.

660
01:00:32,137 --> 01:00:34,550
Ivy found it that way, didn't we dear?

661
01:00:38,111 --> 01:00:41,063
- Nice material.
- Goodbye.

662
01:00:59,505 --> 01:01:01,885
Very nice material.

663
01:01:12,076 --> 01:01:17,158
- Marcia is a very pretty girl, isn't she?
- Oui. Yes sir.

664
01:01:19,645 --> 01:01:21,518
That's what frightens you, isn't it?

665
01:01:24,085 --> 01:01:25,690
Why, no, sir, I...

666
01:01:27,398 --> 01:01:29,779
You're afraid I'll become
interested in Marcia.

667
01:01:30,367 --> 01:01:36,305
- Why, well, if you, If you want to I...
- What? What?

668
01:01:38,204 --> 01:01:40,424
You're not very clear.

669
01:01:42,590 --> 01:01:44,836
Well sir, I...

670
01:01:44,866 --> 01:01:52,512
Oh. Oh, you poor child.
I'm such a tease, aren't I? Such a tease.

671
01:01:54,706 --> 01:01:55,706
Yes sir.

672
01:01:59,058 --> 01:02:02,213
Ah, what a lucky man
I am to be loved this way.

673
01:02:07,691 --> 01:02:10,222
But supposing I did
have to leave you for a while?

674
01:02:12,424 --> 01:02:17,189
- Leave sir, when?
- I'm not saying when, I said suppose.

675
01:02:19,424 --> 01:02:20,575
Well I...

676
01:02:22,010 --> 01:02:25,220
Supposing I had to
take a trip from time to time?

677
01:02:26,206 --> 01:02:30,096
You, you mean, soon?

678
01:02:30,523 --> 01:02:31,761
Well now, I don't know.

679
01:02:34,664 --> 01:02:36,472
Oh, you mustn't look so worried.

680
01:02:39,342 --> 01:02:41,182
It won't be for a long, long time.

681
01:02:44,820 --> 01:02:45,820
Oh, I see.

682
01:02:46,682 --> 01:02:48,682
So we won't think about it now, will we?

683
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:50,680
No, sir.

684
01:02:50,954 --> 01:02:53,204
When I do go it'll
break your heart, won't it?

685
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:55,580
Yes sir.

686
01:03:07,135 --> 01:03:08,135
Well...

687
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:11,810
What would my little
cherub like to do this evening?

688
01:03:12,667 --> 01:03:14,562
Oh, sir, could we go out?

689
01:03:15,111 --> 01:03:18,857
Out? You mean gad
about a bit, see the sights?

690
01:03:18,887 --> 01:03:21,738
Yes sir. Oh, you'd like it, wouldn't you sir?

691
01:03:21,768 --> 01:03:25,018
Well now, I don't know, I don't
know, that might be very charming.

692
01:03:25,683 --> 01:03:26,998
Where would we go?

693
01:03:27,028 --> 01:03:29,628
Oh, they, they say that the
Empire and such places...

694
01:03:29,629 --> 01:03:30,781
They do? Who does?

695
01:03:31,402 --> 01:03:34,770
- Marcia sir, she said it's ever so gay.
- Oh, really?

696
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:35,800
Yes.

697
01:03:36,847 --> 01:03:40,690
We can go, can't we?
They say that the bill is ever so good.

698
01:03:45,540 --> 01:03:47,090
I haven't been out for so long.

699
01:03:47,091 --> 01:03:49,868
No. No, that's right. You haven't, have you?

700
01:03:50,371 --> 01:03:52,699
You do look a little pale.

701
01:03:52,797 --> 01:03:56,825
Yes, yes, that's true. Not that
I am complaining, you understand...

702
01:03:56,855 --> 01:04:01,625
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. I understand, you,
you're just nervous and jumpy, that's all.

703
01:04:01,655 --> 01:04:03,378
- Yes sir.
- Yes, yes.

704
01:04:03,408 --> 01:04:05,613
You have that cooped-up feeling.

705
01:04:07,026 --> 01:04:09,326
- Yes, you do understand, don't you?
- Oh, yes.

706
01:04:09,327 --> 01:04:12,557
- Well then a number...
- Well now, now, where would we go?

707
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:17,738
We might go to Albert Hall.

708
01:04:18,163 --> 01:04:21,193
Yes, and hear a symphony.

709
01:04:22,849 --> 01:04:24,368
Albert Hall sir?

710
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:30,594
Well, I sort of hoped that...

711
01:04:33,166 --> 01:04:37,285
- What makes you say...?
- So you'd like to go out, eh?

712
01:04:41,321 --> 01:04:44,687
Yes sir, I'll go and put my things on.

713
01:04:46,547 --> 01:04:49,680
Don't hurry, because we're not going.

714
01:04:51,554 --> 01:04:52,554
Sir?

715
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:58,341
The bill is ever so good right here.

716
01:05:18,017 --> 01:05:21,301
Now, let's see, what shall we do?

717
01:05:27,609 --> 01:05:29,264
We could play cards.

718
01:05:35,627 --> 01:05:38,596
But you're probably
tired of cards, aren't you?

719
01:05:45,848 --> 01:05:49,756
You might read to me, yes.

720
01:05:52,506 --> 01:05:53,615
Yes.

721
01:05:55,229 --> 01:05:58,308
Milton's Paradise Lost would be nice.

722
01:06:03,411 --> 01:06:05,450
But we haven't the book, have we?

723
01:06:09,514 --> 01:06:14,043
And I don't suppose you
know it from memory, do you?

724
01:06:16,082 --> 01:06:19,831
I know, I know what we like.

725
01:06:31,845 --> 01:06:33,432
You must sing for me.

726
01:06:36,183 --> 01:06:38,700
No. Oh no, not that.

727
01:06:38,730 --> 01:06:39,781
- Why not?
- Not that.

728
01:06:40,000 --> 01:06:41,259
Not in good voice?

729
01:06:41,289 --> 01:06:44,390
- No, it isn't that sir but...
- Oh, but it's such a pretty song.

730
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:46,637
- Oh please, not tonight.
- Oh yes, sing it gaily.

731
01:06:46,638 --> 01:06:49,688
- I can't, truly I can't.
- Sing it with deep compassion then.

732
01:06:49,689 --> 01:06:51,939
- Please I don't...
- Or loving kindness even.

733
01:06:52,299 --> 01:06:54,949
- Sing it moodily, sing it with...
- I can't, I can't.

734
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:56,938

The world is yours my
darling, the moment is mine.

here my girl, if you think the world...

746
01:08:22,331 --> 01:08:23,453
Good morning sir.

747
01:08:24,862 --> 01:08:29,255
- How about a nice hot cup of tea sir?
- No, no, thanks Poole.

748
01:08:29,285 --> 01:08:31,885
Would you consider a
telegram from foreign parts sir?

749
01:08:34,564 --> 01:08:36,767
And a nice cup of tea as well sir, eh?

750
01:08:37,286 --> 01:08:41,636
I know it's good news, Hobson told me last
night that they were expected home today sir.

751
01:08:41,925 --> 01:08:44,894
This is a great day for us sir,
if you forgive me saying so.

752
01:08:45,113 --> 01:08:48,684
Soon be back to our regular meals,
regular hours, regular ways sir.

753
01:08:49,163 --> 01:08:51,613
Your breakfast will
be ready in a few minutes sir.

754
01:08:51,614 --> 01:08:53,639
- Poole?
- Sir?

755
01:08:53,949 --> 01:08:55,702
I want you to put on your
hat coat and, and...

756
01:08:55,703 --> 01:08:59,353
take an envelope to the district
messenger office to be delivered by hand.

757
01:08:59,484 --> 01:09:00,593
Very good sir.

758
01:09:47,690 --> 01:09:50,372
Ivy, Ivy dear, it's me.

759
01:09:58,856 --> 01:10:01,812
- Oh Marcia, hello.
- Hello Ivy.

760
01:10:01,842 --> 01:10:04,245
I didn't hear you, hello, Fred.

761
01:10:08,024 --> 01:10:09,776
You get yourself a drink Fred.

762
01:10:11,185 --> 01:10:13,635
- I'll make some tea.
- We don't want anything.

763
01:10:15,072 --> 01:10:16,522
Yes, but...

764
01:10:24,116 --> 01:10:26,018
Don't bother about us Ivy dear.

765
01:10:31,081 --> 01:10:33,038
- Oh Marcia.
- Oh.

766
01:10:41,903 --> 01:10:43,312
For Miss Ivy Peterson.

767
01:10:45,556 --> 01:10:46,582
Thanks guvnor.

768
01:11:00,935 --> 01:11:02,166
Look.

769
01:11:07,502 --> 01:11:08,802
Fifty pounds.

770
01:11:10,814 --> 01:11:13,914
There ain't no letter with it,
you don't suppose it's from him?

771
01:11:14,042 --> 01:11:16,542
Yes, the rotten
must've sent it for what he's done.

772
01:11:16,543 --> 01:11:19,222
No, not him, he's too mean, he is.

773
01:11:23,073 --> 01:11:24,701
Oh, I don't know.

774
01:11:27,779 --> 01:11:29,776
I wouldn't put it past him.

775
01:11:35,209 --> 01:11:36,209
Yes.

776
01:11:37,522 --> 01:11:38,876
Yes, that's it.

777
01:11:41,202 --> 01:11:43,350
Hopes I'll use it to try and run away.

778
01:11:44,677 --> 01:11:47,524
Oh, I can see him thinking it up, I can.

779
01:11:49,398 --> 01:11:52,176
And then, then he'll follow me.

780
01:11:53,558 --> 01:11:56,281
And just when I
think that I got free, he'll...

781
01:11:58,402 --> 01:12:02,466
I can't stand it anymore, I can't stand it.

782
01:12:05,547 --> 01:12:07,217
Oh, if I could only do it...

783
01:12:08,818 --> 01:12:10,665
I'd go down to the river.

784
01:12:15,003 --> 01:12:16,084
Oh, Ivy.

785
01:12:17,698 --> 01:12:20,448
It's her nerves, that's what.
She ought to see a doctor.

786
01:12:23,061 --> 01:12:27,262
Oh now, there's a copy of the Winged Victory,
the real one is in the Louvre in Paris.

787
01:12:27,292 --> 01:12:29,027
I know because I saw it there.

788
01:12:29,260 --> 01:12:32,160
What's the sense of being
victorious if you haven't a head?

789
01:12:32,201 --> 01:12:34,351
And what's the sense of my taking a trip...

790
01:12:34,352 --> 01:12:37,452
acquiring art and culture if
you're not going to pay attention?

791
01:12:37,453 --> 01:12:40,981
Look, you're back here.
That's the only victory that counts.

792
01:12:41,544 --> 01:12:43,894
That's why I was
deluged with all those letters.

793
01:12:43,895 --> 01:12:45,794
- Bea, now look...
- Oh, I know.

794
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:49,490
But if I ever go away again and you
don't write just because you're ill...

795
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:53,339
Oh, don't you see how much
more worried that would make me?

796
01:12:55,237 --> 01:12:57,037
It all amounts to this, doesn't it?

797
01:12:57,038 --> 01:13:01,338
But February is still a long way away, and
your father will simply have to listen to...

798
01:13:02,459 --> 01:13:06,586
In the minute you stop looking at me,
I won't be responsible for what happens.

799
01:13:09,366 --> 01:13:12,607
- Aren't public places awful sometimes?
- Awful.

800
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:15,944
- May I interrupt this loud conversation?
- Oh, here you are.

801
01:13:15,974 --> 01:13:19,356
Sir Charles, I'm glad to see you sir. Sorry
you weren't when I call you, you look fine.

802
01:13:19,357 --> 01:13:20,407
It's nice to be back.

803
01:13:20,408 --> 01:13:22,281
- You're looking well yourself Harry.
- Thank you.

804
01:13:22,282 --> 01:13:24,882
Sorry to be late my dear,
in an argument at the club.

805
01:13:25,238 --> 01:13:26,638
Well, what's on the program?

806
01:13:26,639 --> 01:13:29,309
If I don't know I'd go to Stewart's and
have tea if that's agreeable for everybody.

807
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:30,404
Excellent, but...

808
01:13:31,028 --> 01:13:35,078
while it's on my mind Harry, there's
something we must straighten out immediately.

809
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:37,890
I've gone through a
lot of times with Beatrix over this matter.

810
01:13:37,891 --> 01:13:41,741
Possible I'm getting old and crotchety,
but I won't put up with it any longer.

811
01:13:41,742 --> 01:13:44,792
I'm afraid you must take her
off my hands as soon as possible.

812
01:13:45,127 --> 01:13:46,736
Oh father.

813
01:13:47,294 --> 01:13:49,341
Well, Sir Charles, that's a...

814
01:13:49,371 --> 01:13:51,526
Of course, I shall
insist on all the trimmings...

815
01:13:51,527 --> 01:13:54,777
Wedding at St. Margaret's,
Bishop Manners, reception and all that.

816
01:13:54,778 --> 01:13:56,981
Yes sir, yes Sir Charles. I'd, I...

817
01:13:57,035 --> 01:13:59,859
Well, show her you're
happy about it, do something, man.

818
01:14:04,917 --> 01:14:08,080
Just another work of
art madam, it's not in your catalog.

819
01:14:15,949 --> 01:14:17,799
We're feeling rather gay, are we sir?

820
01:14:18,062 --> 01:14:20,733
Poole old friend,
I'm going to be married, very soon.

821
01:14:21,193 --> 01:14:23,393
Sir, you don't know how happy that makes me.

822
01:14:23,394 --> 01:14:24,656
I knew it would Poole.

823
01:14:26,063 --> 01:14:27,063
Thank you.

824
01:14:27,716 --> 01:14:31,016
Sir, there's a patient in the
consulting room, a Miss Ivy Peterson.

825
01:14:32,314 --> 01:14:35,764
She's without an appointment sir,
if you've no time, I can tell her...

826
01:14:35,765 --> 01:14:37,891
No, no, that's all right. I'll see her.

827
01:15:30,954 --> 01:15:34,161
You sir, so you are the famous Dr. Jekyll.

828
01:15:35,976 --> 01:15:37,015
Well...

829
01:15:38,383 --> 01:15:42,302
I'm the one you and, you and
your friend took home that night.

830
01:15:43,298 --> 01:15:45,378
- Remember?
- Well, what...

831
01:15:45,498 --> 01:15:47,248
what brings you here Miss Peterson?

832
01:15:47,983 --> 01:15:49,800
- I think...
- Are you ill?

833
01:15:59,379 --> 01:16:00,379
There.

834
01:16:01,536 --> 01:16:02,536
That's what.

835
01:16:04,294 --> 01:16:05,618
Look at that.

836
01:16:07,764 --> 01:16:08,764
Pretty, ain't it?

837
01:16:10,347 --> 01:16:12,447
Did you ever see a thing like that before?

838
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:17,079
- I'll get you some lotion.
- Lotion?

839
01:16:18,382 --> 01:16:20,582
It won't be lotion that'll do the trick sir.

840
01:16:21,523 --> 01:16:25,683
It's more than that, I need help.
I do not. I can't stand it anymore.

841
01:16:28,978 --> 01:16:30,193
It's Hyde sir.

842
01:16:31,167 --> 01:16:36,257
It's a man I know, Mr. Hyde. It's him that's
done it and more, more I can't tell you.

843
01:16:37,035 --> 01:16:39,454
He ain't a human, he's a beast.

844
01:16:39,672 --> 01:16:43,482
And he won't let me go sir,
and I, and I am afraid to run away.

845
01:16:47,390 --> 01:16:51,232
Marcia, she's my girlfriend,
and Freddie, that's her friend, they...

846
01:16:51,626 --> 01:16:54,926
Well, they say it's my nerves,
and that you know about such things.

847
01:16:55,162 --> 01:16:56,301
And you could help me.

848
01:16:57,023 --> 01:17:00,132
Oh, I can't bear up under it no more.

849
01:17:08,693 --> 01:17:09,985
If you can't help me...

850
01:17:11,387 --> 01:17:14,057
give me some poison so I can kill myself.

851
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:19,542
Why didn't you try to get help before?
Why didn't you go to the police?

852
01:17:19,572 --> 01:17:22,059
Tell you, I'm afraid, I...

853
01:17:23,033 --> 01:17:26,251
he ain't a man, he's a devil, he is.

854
01:17:27,510 --> 01:17:29,542
Why he knows what
you're thinking about, he does.

855
01:17:29,543 --> 01:17:32,743
Oh, if he knows that I've bee here,
what he'll do, what he'll do.

856
01:17:32,744 --> 01:17:34,494
Won't be nothing human, I can tell.

857
01:17:37,975 --> 01:17:41,029
Oh please, please help me keep him off.

858
01:17:45,112 --> 01:17:46,765
I do anything you ask sir.

859
01:17:51,155 --> 01:17:53,443
I ain't as bad as you might think.

860
01:17:56,474 --> 01:17:57,474
Well...

861
01:17:58,740 --> 01:17:59,780
Men say that I...

862
01:18:01,291 --> 01:18:03,677
I ain't a bad looker when I'm more myself.

863
01:18:07,366 --> 01:18:09,316
You liked me once a little, didn't you?

864
01:18:11,690 --> 01:18:12,948
Really, you...

865
01:18:13,408 --> 01:18:15,652
you're such a fine and kind gentleman.

866
01:18:17,196 --> 01:18:19,910
Honest that night, walked out to my place...

867
01:18:22,012 --> 01:18:23,676
I made as if I didn't care.

868
01:18:25,351 --> 01:18:26,351
I did care.

869
01:18:28,131 --> 01:18:31,546
After you'd gone,
I kept wishing you'd come back.

870
01:18:32,268 --> 01:18:33,757
Truly, I did.

871
01:18:45,098 --> 01:18:47,451
This man Hyde will never trouble you again.

872
01:18:49,246 --> 01:18:50,790
I give you my word.

873
01:18:51,577 --> 01:18:54,627
How do you know? He'll come
back, he'll come back and kill me.

874
01:18:56,733 --> 01:18:57,937
He won't come back.

875
01:18:59,152 --> 01:19:00,152
I'll see to it.

876
01:19:02,009 --> 01:19:03,508
Oh, you don't know him, sir.

877
01:19:04,603 --> 01:19:07,003
Oh, you don't know him.
He ain't human, he ain't.

878
01:19:07,581 --> 01:19:09,114
I gave you my word.

879
01:19:11,018 --> 01:19:12,650
You'll never see Hyde again.

880
01:19:14,872 --> 01:19:16,152
You must believe me.

881
01:19:21,997 --> 01:19:23,322
I believe you sir.

882
01:19:25,117 --> 01:19:26,365
I believe you.

883
01:19:28,510 --> 01:19:29,605
You must go now.

884
01:19:34,849 --> 01:19:35,878
Yes, sir.

885
01:19:57,310 --> 01:19:58,919
For a moment, I thought...

886
01:20:06,187 --> 01:20:07,187
Goodbye.

887
01:20:17,017 --> 01:20:18,067
I'm very sorry sir...

888
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:21,394
I should never admitted such a person,
I didn't know she was hysterical sir.

889
01:20:21,395 --> 01:20:23,845
That's quite all right Pool,
I'm glad you admitted her.

890
01:20:23,846 --> 01:20:25,335
Now sir, about the wedding sir.

891
01:20:25,336 --> 01:20:26,724
We've got a lot to discuss sir...

892
01:20:26,725 --> 01:20:28,272
- of course we've never been married before.
- All right.

893
01:20:28,273 --> 01:20:30,873
But let's not get upset now,
we'll manage it somehow.

894
01:20:30,874 --> 01:20:31,874
Thank you.

895
01:20:32,468 --> 01:20:35,068
- Good evening Mr. Weller.
- Good evening Dr. Jekyll.

896
01:20:35,069 --> 01:20:37,819
A touch of autumn in the air,
very seasonable, isn't it?

897
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:40,420
- Wonderful Mr. Weller, wonderful.
- Now listen here.

898
01:20:40,563 --> 01:20:42,863
Remember that comet
I was telling you about eh?

899
01:20:42,864 --> 01:20:45,325
The blooming thing
didn't hit us after all, did it?

900
01:20:45,326 --> 01:20:46,800
- You know why, did you?
- No, why?

901
01:20:46,801 --> 01:20:49,409
Because it knew at this very
moment, just across the park...

902
01:20:49,410 --> 01:20:52,736
Sir Charles Emery is waiting to announce
the coming marriage of his daughter...

903
01:20:52,737 --> 01:20:55,508
- to the very man you're talking to.
- Dr. Jekyll.

904
01:20:55,666 --> 01:20:58,486
And my best wishes to
the Mrs. Jekyll as is to be.

905
01:20:58,516 --> 01:21:00,538
Thank you, thank you
Mr. Weller, you don't mind if I hurry up?

906
01:21:00,539 --> 01:21:03,162
- Godspeed Dr. Jekyll.
- Thank you Mr. Weller.

907
01:23:28,145 --> 01:23:29,792
Oh...

908
01:23:47,643 --> 01:23:52,839
Here's hoping that Hyde rots wherever he is..

909
01:23:54,592 --> 01:23:58,419
Burn slow when the time comes.

910
01:24:05,475 --> 01:24:10,029
Here is hoping
that Dr. Jekyll thinks of his Ivy...

911
01:24:12,103 --> 01:24:14,155
as I know he'd like to.

912
01:24:16,828 --> 01:24:18,966
And as his Ivy thinks of him.

913
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:27,090
Because he's an angel. Here's to my angel.

914
01:24:57,086 --> 01:24:58,326
Surprised?

915
01:24:59,267 --> 01:25:01,517
Couldn't be that you didn't expect to see me?

916
01:25:03,294 --> 01:25:04,504
No.

917
01:25:05,915 --> 01:25:09,335
I do, I've been waiting for you.

918
01:25:09,570 --> 01:25:13,098
But you've been celebrating.
Is there some new event, some change?

919
01:25:14,659 --> 01:25:15,659
No.

920
01:25:17,797 --> 01:25:18,978
No. I just thought...

921
01:25:19,008 --> 01:25:21,614
No, you just been drinking
to calm your nerves, eh?

922
01:25:21,915 --> 01:25:25,377
It is your nerves, isn't it?
Perhaps you should see a doctor.

923
01:25:28,895 --> 01:25:29,895
No.

924
01:25:31,742 --> 01:25:33,794
No, I don't need a doctor.

925
01:25:36,613 --> 01:25:38,463
Would you like to have some wine sir?

926
01:25:39,754 --> 01:25:41,478
I get you another glass.

927
01:25:46,609 --> 01:25:49,920
Dr. Jekyll is a good man,
yes, Dr. Henry Jekyll.

928
01:25:50,248 --> 01:25:52,616
- Is he?
- Yes. Yes.

929
01:25:53,232 --> 01:25:57,350
And a fine gentleman too.
Different than any man you might know.

930
01:25:57,528 --> 01:25:59,279
Yes, yes.

931
01:25:59,908 --> 01:26:04,451
A nice, fine gentleman like yourself sir,
wouldn't be knowing such a person, no.

932
01:26:05,108 --> 01:26:09,363
I ain't such a bad looker sir,
when I'm more myself, yes.

933
01:26:09,910 --> 01:26:13,235
He's the kind of man you can
get down on your knees to, isn't he?

934
01:26:13,265 --> 01:26:16,779
A sweet, dear, pure man
that you can trust and believe.

935
01:26:17,217 --> 01:26:19,844
He's a smug, hypocritical
coward, that's what he is.

936
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:22,348
- You couldn't know him.
- I know him intimately.

937
01:26:22,378 --> 01:26:23,990
And I detest him intimately.

938
01:26:24,208 --> 01:26:27,013
From his lofty brain to
the soles of his virtuous feet.

939
01:26:27,219 --> 01:26:31,201
And you, you, I'll do anything you ask sir.

940
01:26:31,231 --> 01:26:34,307
Well, you saw him, didn't you?
You saw the respectable fool.

941
01:26:34,470 --> 01:26:38,244
Clutched his halo and held
it straight, didn't he? Didn't he?

942
01:26:38,274 --> 01:26:39,616
How do you know all that?

943
01:26:39,617 --> 01:26:42,067
I know everything you
do and everything you think.

944
01:26:42,068 --> 01:26:44,121
Dr. Jekyll wouldn't
tell you, he ain't the kind of...

945
01:26:44,122 --> 01:26:47,987
And as you were leaving the room,
you turned at the door, didn't you?

946
01:26:48,210 --> 01:26:51,477
And you said, for a moment, I thought...

947
01:26:51,819 --> 01:26:54,744
What did you think? What did you think?

948
01:26:55,188 --> 01:26:57,976
Did you think Dr. Jekyll
was falling in love with you?

949
01:26:58,283 --> 01:27:00,541
You, with your cheap little dreams?

950
01:27:03,893 --> 01:27:08,956
Or did you think perhaps, that
in him, you saw a bit of me...

951
01:27:09,247 --> 01:27:10,496
Hyde?

952
01:27:13,712 --> 01:27:16,927
Oh, but it confuses you, doesn't it?

953
01:27:17,714 --> 01:27:19,972
It isn't quite clear, is it?

954
01:27:22,075 --> 01:27:23,255
Oh...

955
01:27:24,487 --> 01:27:28,369
- What you going to do?
- Something so simple.

956
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:33,039
I'm going to put an
end to all that confusion.

957
01:27:44,054 --> 01:27:46,910
Please sir. Oh, no.

958
01:27:47,782 --> 01:27:49,766
Please no.

959
01:27:52,724 --> 01:27:56,145
Yes dance, dance and dream.

960
01:27:56,641 --> 01:27:59,634
Dream that you're
Mrs. Henry Jekyll of Harley Street...

961
01:28:00,164 --> 01:28:03,054
dancing with your own butler and six footmen.

962
01:28:03,636 --> 01:28:08,887
Dream they've all turned into white mice
and crawled into an eternal pumpkin.

963
01:28:14,137 --> 01:28:16,754
Hear, you in there, open this here door.

964
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:30,483
- Ivy.
- Who's that in there?

965
01:28:43,413 --> 01:28:45,979
Hey, you there, look here guvnor.

966
01:28:46,150 --> 01:28:47,245
Steady.

967
01:29:37,569 --> 01:29:38,669
Open up and let me in.

968
01:29:38,670 --> 01:29:40,355
- I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.
- Dr. Jekyll is not home.

969
01:29:40,356 --> 01:29:41,796
That can't make a
difference, he told me to wait.

970
01:29:41,797 --> 01:29:44,218
- I know all Dr. Jekyll's friends.
- Let me in I tell you.

971
01:29:44,219 --> 01:29:46,547
- You'll have to come back later.
- Let me in or I'll bash this door...

972
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:47,175
Go away.

973
01:29:47,280 --> 01:29:49,980
If you don't go away,
I'll have to send for the police.

974
01:30:41,565 --> 01:30:42,865
That's him, there he goes.

975
01:30:43,641 --> 01:30:46,592
- This ain't no place to rob.
- But robbed it is.

976
01:30:46,767 --> 01:30:48,422
Help, police.

977
01:30:54,543 --> 01:30:56,293
- Good night, Charles.
- Good night.

978
01:30:56,323 --> 01:30:58,723
I'm so sorry your
young man was detained my dear.

979
01:30:58,724 --> 01:31:00,315
So am I Uncle Geoffrey.

980
01:31:22,881 --> 01:31:23,881
Good evening sir.

981
01:31:24,273 --> 01:31:26,523
There was a ring at the door a while ago sir.

982
01:31:26,594 --> 01:31:29,685
When I answered it,
there was nobody there, I found this.

983
01:31:58,197 --> 01:32:01,347
You don't happen to know what
purpose Dr. Jekyll uses these for?

984
01:32:01,348 --> 01:32:05,100
No sir, I don't rightly know.
I don't rightly know sir.

985
01:32:11,604 --> 01:32:13,669
- Have you got it?
- What you doing hiding behind that...?

986
01:32:13,670 --> 01:32:16,970
Why, I was waiting for you
Dr. Lanyon, I'm the man from Dr. Jekyll.

987
01:32:17,000 --> 01:32:19,212
- Get me the package, I'd be get out now.
- Step inside the house.

988
01:32:19,213 --> 01:32:20,608
No, no, no, not time.

989
01:32:20,914 --> 01:32:23,964
As Jekyll's friend, I've the
right to ask you a few questions.

990
01:32:24,490 --> 01:32:26,890
Come now, don't waste
time with prying questions.

991
01:32:27,259 --> 01:32:30,159
- Let me have it...
- I don't like your attitude my friend.

992
01:32:30,160 --> 01:32:34,060
- Suppose you introduce yourself.
- Hyde, Hyde, what difference does that make?

993
01:32:37,842 --> 01:32:39,831
- You an acquaintance of Jekyll?
- Yes.

994
01:32:39,989 --> 01:32:43,225
Yes, of course, I'm an
old friend. Now let me have the...

995
01:32:43,255 --> 01:32:44,255
Where is Dr. Jekyll?

996
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:47,496
- Oh, don't worry, he's alive.
- What's the matter? Is he ill?

997
01:32:47,497 --> 01:32:49,747
No, no, he's perfectly all right. I tell you.

998
01:32:49,752 --> 01:32:52,402
Very well then, I'll
come with you and see for myself.

999
01:32:52,403 --> 01:32:55,353
- You pretentious fool.
- You take another step with that...

1000
01:32:55,354 --> 01:32:57,404
- I'll shoot.
- Now, wait a minute Lanyon.

1001
01:32:57,949 --> 01:33:01,699
I can't let you come with me and I
can't tell you any more than I already...

1002
01:33:01,700 --> 01:33:04,344
- Why not?
- Because, because...

1003
01:33:05,479 --> 01:33:07,829
I warn you now,
don't stick your nose into this.

1004
01:33:08,045 --> 01:33:09,510
Better let me go Lanyon.

1005
01:33:10,561 --> 01:33:13,311
You can ask Jekyll all
about it tomorrow if you want to.

1006
01:33:13,312 --> 01:33:15,562
You will take me to Harry Jekyll this minute.

1007
01:33:15,933 --> 01:33:18,883
For the last time Lanyon,
would you let me leave here alone?

1008
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:22,033
- No.
- All right, all right then.

1009
01:33:23,253 --> 01:33:24,880
Let it be on your own head.

1010
01:34:09,283 --> 01:34:10,741
Now, once again Lanyon...

1011
01:34:11,849 --> 01:34:13,995
will you let me take this glass and go?

1012
01:34:14,752 --> 01:34:15,937
No, why should I?

1013
01:34:17,002 --> 01:34:18,376
For your own sake, Lanyon.

1014
01:34:18,468 --> 01:34:20,668
Whatever you're going to do, get on with it.

1015
01:35:35,100 --> 01:35:39,893
I warned you John,
even as Hyde I warned you..

1016
01:35:49,958 --> 01:35:51,858
See what you've done, don't you?

1017
01:35:52,389 --> 01:35:56,548
I mean you, you've gone
beyond, you've tampered with...

1018
01:35:57,918 --> 01:36:00,399
you've committed the supreme blasphemy.

1019
01:36:01,529 --> 01:36:03,925
I know John, I know.

1020
01:36:04,319 --> 01:36:06,334
You must destroy the
formula at once, you understand?

1021
01:36:06,335 --> 01:36:07,277
I've done that.

1022
01:36:07,278 --> 01:36:10,978
No, no, I mean destroy from your
mind, you, you can't take the thing again.

1023
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:12,585
I know, I know, I know.

1024
01:36:14,510 --> 01:36:15,822
Tonight...

1025
01:36:16,164 --> 01:36:18,202
Tonight, on my way to Sir Charles'...

1026
01:36:19,115 --> 01:36:20,973
You see, I thought I could control...

1027
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:25,553
But tonight this change,
this thing you saw happened without my...

1028
01:36:26,763 --> 01:36:28,786
- About Bea?
- I'll tell her.

1029
01:36:31,387 --> 01:36:33,637
At least I have
strength enough left for that.

1030
01:37:28,924 --> 01:37:29,924
Darling.

1031
01:37:31,182 --> 01:37:34,299
I, I heard you playing.

1032
01:37:34,834 --> 01:37:36,534
I thought we could talk in here...

1033
01:37:37,242 --> 01:37:41,536
- just as well as anywhere.
- Well, of course dear.

1034
01:37:42,003 --> 01:37:45,192
I can't imagine how
you felt last night when I...

1035
01:37:45,222 --> 01:37:48,927
You don't have to explain anything.
I know it must've been important.

1036
01:37:49,434 --> 01:37:50,834
You know that I'd forgive...

1037
01:37:50,835 --> 01:37:53,585
But that's it, you mustn't,
you mustn't forgive anymore.

1038
01:37:53,770 --> 01:37:55,412
Must make up your mind to...

1039
01:37:59,175 --> 01:38:01,693
Tell me, darling, what's wrong?

1040
01:38:04,525 --> 01:38:07,549
What is it, Harry? Look at me.

1041
01:38:10,066 --> 01:38:11,503
Please Bea...

1042
01:38:12,215 --> 01:38:13,391
Let me begin.

1043
01:38:16,443 --> 01:38:20,740
- There's no way to begin except to tell you.
- Tell me what?

1044
01:38:23,804 --> 01:38:26,500
You're, you're a brave girl, aren't you?

1045
01:38:28,264 --> 01:38:29,291
Yes.

1046
01:38:29,537 --> 01:38:33,464
That's why I can tell you like this
because you are brave and strong.

1047
01:38:33,806 --> 01:38:35,270
Always remember that.

1048
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:41,003
Bea, we can't be married.
I must never see you.

1049
01:38:42,181 --> 01:38:43,181
Oh you...

1050
01:38:44,849 --> 01:38:49,556
You don't know what you,
Harry, what's happened? Look at me.

1051
01:38:49,769 --> 01:38:51,619
Just that, that's all I can tell you.

1052
01:38:51,964 --> 01:38:52,977
But why?

1053
01:38:53,650 --> 01:38:54,650
What?

1054
01:38:55,238 --> 01:38:57,988
We always said that
there's nothing we couldn't discuss.

1055
01:38:58,563 --> 01:39:02,665
- Nothing secret between you and me, ever.
- Don't ask any more, please.

1056
01:39:02,695 --> 01:39:05,379
If you ever believe me, believe now,
if you ever trusted me, trust me now.

1057
01:39:05,380 --> 01:39:09,208
It's for your happiness and mine,
believe me, it's all I can say.

1058
01:39:09,508 --> 01:39:11,862
Oh, my darling.

1059
01:39:15,611 --> 01:39:16,815
Are you ill?

1060
01:39:17,444 --> 01:39:19,743
- There's something you...
- No, no.

1061
01:39:20,345 --> 01:39:23,995
No Bea, don't ask me any more.
Don't try to understand, just take my word.

1062
01:39:24,052 --> 01:39:25,215
Now, please go.

1063
01:39:28,280 --> 01:39:29,927
This is so wrong of me.

1064
01:39:32,268 --> 01:39:34,260
Make you go through all of this.

1065
01:39:37,201 --> 01:39:39,397
You're trying not to hurt me, aren't you?

1066
01:39:40,336 --> 01:39:44,235
Harry, Harry, it's all right...

1067
01:39:44,577 --> 01:39:46,575
if you don't love me anymore.

1068
01:39:48,423 --> 01:39:50,503
I know things like that can happen.

1069
01:39:54,416 --> 01:39:57,741
Oh, you do, you still do.

1070
01:39:59,068 --> 01:40:02,338
- What is it dearest?
- Bea, Bea darling.

1071
01:40:02,368 --> 01:40:03,368
No.

1072
01:40:04,637 --> 01:40:06,258
Don't say anything more.

1073
01:40:07,311 --> 01:40:08,912
Just hold me close.

1074
01:40:15,275 --> 01:40:16,452
Goodbye darling.

1075
01:40:19,270 --> 01:40:20,734
Harry.

1076
01:40:21,637 --> 01:40:26,125
Harry please, please
come back, please don't...

1077
01:40:27,220 --> 01:40:28,547
Harry.

1078
01:41:23,746 --> 01:41:25,388
Oh, you did come back.

1079
01:41:27,235 --> 01:41:28,959
Oh, my darling.

1080
01:41:39,892 --> 01:41:41,041
Father.

1081
01:41:41,466 --> 01:41:43,094
Father.

1082
01:41:46,925 --> 01:41:49,196
Beatrix, Beatrix.

1083
01:41:49,990 --> 01:41:51,741
Help, help.

1084
01:42:06,258 --> 01:42:08,258
What's the matter sir? What's wrong sir?

1085
01:42:08,496 --> 01:42:09,496
Help.

1086
01:42:09,497 --> 01:42:13,667
Look, there he goes, there he goes.
Look, look, there he goes.

1087
01:42:16,268 --> 01:42:19,689
Hey, stop there, stop there.

1088
01:42:35,042 --> 01:42:37,313
Hey, what's going on?

1089
01:42:55,348 --> 01:42:56,894
Hold it, you.

1090
01:43:22,153 --> 01:43:23,453
This is the weapon doctor.

1091
01:43:29,967 --> 01:43:31,212
Yes I...

1092
01:43:33,059 --> 01:43:35,932
- You come with me inspector.
- Ward, you remain here.

1093
01:44:22,359 --> 01:44:25,164
Dr. Jekyll, that frightful
maniac broke into the house.

1094
01:44:25,452 --> 01:44:27,146
- Did he attack you sir?
- Yes.

1095
01:44:27,176 --> 01:44:30,926
- Which way did he go sir? Out here?
- I didn't even know you were home sir.

1096
01:44:30,927 --> 01:44:33,424
- Are you badly hurt?
- No, no, I'll be all right.

1097
01:44:33,454 --> 01:44:35,025
This here door is locked.

1098
01:44:36,517 --> 01:44:38,241
- We better go out that way.
- Yes.

1099
01:44:41,237 --> 01:44:42,237
Wait.

1100
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:53,758
- There, heaven help him.
- Dr. Lanyon...

1101
01:44:54,346 --> 01:44:57,254
- But I know this gentleman, he's Dr. Jekyll.
- I know.

1102
01:44:57,284 --> 01:44:58,834
Nevertheless, there's your man.

1103
01:44:59,040 --> 01:45:02,140
I'm sorry sir, but I know Dr. Jekyll.
Have known him for years.

1104
01:45:02,556 --> 01:45:05,756
- This is your master, isn't it?
- Of course sir, no doubt of it.

1105
01:45:05,827 --> 01:45:08,727
- Then we must've lost him, come men.
- No, no. Wait.

1106
01:45:09,166 --> 01:45:10,986
Tell them Jekyll, tell them.

1107
01:45:12,121 --> 01:45:13,571
It's no use Jekyll.

1108
01:45:14,912 --> 01:45:19,112
You know it's no use, tell what happened.
I beg of you Jekyll, tell them who you are.

1109
01:45:19,113 --> 01:45:21,683
- Tell them what you've done.
- I've done nothing.

1110
01:45:22,575 --> 01:45:23,847
I'm Dr. Jekyll.

1111
01:45:25,106 --> 01:45:26,461
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll.

1112
01:45:28,609 --> 01:45:32,071
I've done nothing. I'm Dr. Jekyll.

1113
01:45:33,549 --> 01:45:35,711
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll, I tell you.

1114
01:45:37,420 --> 01:45:38,597
I've done nothing.

1115
01:45:41,032 --> 01:45:44,740
You're looking for a man named Hyde, Hyde.

1116
01:45:46,916 --> 01:45:48,681
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll.

1117
01:45:50,365 --> 01:45:54,702
I'm Dr. Jekyll, I tell you.
I tell you, I'm Dr. Jekyll.

1118
01:45:55,592 --> 01:45:57,562
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll.

1119
01:46:02,474 --> 01:46:04,724
It's no use Jekyll,
you'd better come quietly.

1120
01:47:26,951 --> 01:47:30,824
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

1121
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:34,670
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.

1122
01:47:34,700 --> 01:47:40,184
He leadeth me beside
the still waters. He restoreth my soul.

1123
01:47:42,032 --> 01:47:46,280
He leadeth me in the path
of righteousness, for his name is sake.
