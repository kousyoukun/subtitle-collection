1
00:01:26,668 --> 00:01:28,503
With purity in our hearts...

2
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:30,672
...with right thinking in our minds...

3
00:01:30,839 --> 00:01:34,926
...we arm ourselves
with intolerance of all evil.

4
00:01:35,385 --> 00:01:38,722
So it is, on this glorious
Sabbath morning...

5
00:01:38,888 --> 00:01:42,225
...in this momentous year of 1887...

6
00:01:42,392 --> 00:01:45,812
...we naturally turn our thoughts
towards that way of life...

7
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:50,608
...as exemplified by Victoria,
our beloved queen.

8
00:01:50,775 --> 00:01:55,322
For this week begins Her Majesty's
golden jubilee.

9
00:01:55,488 --> 00:01:59,701
From her heart has come
an ever-increasing flow...

10
00:01:59,868 --> 00:02:02,620
...of virtue and moral blessing.

11
00:02:02,829 --> 00:02:06,291
She came upon a world sadly mired
in the ways of the flesh.

12
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:10,795
But during her reign, the forces of good
have achieved notable....

13
00:02:10,962 --> 00:02:13,465
Stop. Stop.

14
00:02:13,673 --> 00:02:15,717
What's wrong, dear?

15
00:02:15,884 --> 00:02:17,344
--nor the season...

16
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:23,725
...we know that in God 's own time
evil shall be wiped out by good.

17
00:02:23,892 --> 00:02:26,478
Evil wiped out, eh?

18
00:02:26,645 --> 00:02:28,980
You wanna take all the fun out of life?

19
00:02:29,147 --> 00:02:32,150
Good old Beelzebub,
the boy with the horn!

20
00:02:32,317 --> 00:02:35,945
--has taken root in a new goodness,
during these decades.

21
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:40,992
At the family hearth,
in the shops of industry that....

22
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:44,162
That the world moves forward today.

23
00:02:45,997 --> 00:02:47,499
Blasphemy, I calls it...

24
00:02:47,666 --> 00:02:50,961
...to talk that way
about a man 's best friend.

25
00:02:55,048 --> 00:02:56,800
Blasphemy!

26
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,804
-Did Parker go for a constable?
-Yes.

27
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,514
-Hello.
-Hello, governor.

28
00:03:02,722 --> 00:03:04,349
You let me go back in there...

29
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:07,602
...and I'll tell them what a grown man
really thinks about.

30
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:11,231
-He been like this before?
-It's gotten worse since the explosion.

31
00:03:11,398 --> 00:03:14,025
-Shock? I see.
-You're a full-blooded young fella.

32
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,944
-You'll tell them.
-I thought if--

33
00:03:16,111 --> 00:03:18,989
We know, don't we?

34
00:03:19,155 --> 00:03:20,699
What's going on in here?

35
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:23,994
-Drunk and disorderly.
-Now, wait a minute, constable.

36
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,539
Take him to Camden Hospital.
Would you give that to Dr. Heath?

37
00:03:27,706 --> 00:03:33,003
Better take him to the station. He's always--
Oh, Dr. Jekyll. Bats, is he?

38
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:35,630
Right, sir.
Camden Hospital it is, Dr. Jekyll.

39
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:38,842
-All right, me lovely. Upsy-daisy.
-Dr. Jekyll, eh?

40
00:03:39,009 --> 00:03:43,221
Well, you go on, Dr. Jekyll, and try to put
old Beelzebub in his bottomless pit.

41
00:03:43,388 --> 00:03:45,348
He'll show you!

42
00:03:46,933 --> 00:03:50,061
Go back and be good, Dr. Jekyll!

43
00:04:31,102 --> 00:04:33,480
-I must go to the hospital, sir.
-On a Sunday?

44
00:04:33,647 --> 00:04:35,565
You mean that outrageous individual.

45
00:04:35,732 --> 00:04:38,943
Harry says that Providence dropped
the man right into his lap.

46
00:04:39,152 --> 00:04:43,948
-Well, but isn't this most unusual, my boy?
-I'm sorry, but it is, sir, most unusual.

47
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:46,951
Don't you dare be late
for the Marley dinner tonight.

48
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:50,789
And let you have a free rein
with all those men? I should say not.

49
00:04:58,964 --> 00:05:02,300
-That's a silly little hat you've got on.
-I knew you'd like it.

50
00:05:02,509 --> 00:05:04,761
There isn't anything about you I like.

51
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:09,641
All right, Jenkins.

52
00:05:11,184 --> 00:05:12,978
I'm sorry.

53
00:05:14,813 --> 00:05:18,400
-My dear, please.
-Sorry, Father.

54
00:05:18,566 --> 00:05:21,736
Beatrix, I'm a very broad-minded man
but I do wish Harry...

55
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:25,240
...wouldn't make such demonstrations
of affection in public...

56
00:05:25,407 --> 00:05:30,036
-...even if you are going to marry him.
-Now, Father darling, don't be pompous.

57
00:05:30,829 --> 00:05:33,915
Good heavens, nibbling your knuckles.

58
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:38,378
I'll tell them what a grown man
really thinks about.

59
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:41,339
I can't allow it.
It's a matter of ethics, Jekyll.

60
00:05:41,506 --> 00:05:44,759
-Please, Dr. Jekyll, may I go in?
-No, not now, Mrs. Higgins.

61
00:05:44,926 --> 00:05:47,887
Bear up.
That's how you can help.

62
00:05:53,893 --> 00:05:58,440
It's the greatest opportunity I've ever had.
The more I see it, the more I realize it.

63
00:05:58,606 --> 00:06:01,484
My dear Jekyll, you know how
we all admire your work...

64
00:06:01,651 --> 00:06:04,863
...and this case does come
within the scope of your research.

65
00:06:05,071 --> 00:06:07,741
That's why I'd like to bow
to your opinion.

66
00:06:07,907 --> 00:06:11,369
But as head of the staff
at this hospital, I cannot....

67
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:21,838
Listen, Jekyll, tell me straight out:
What could you do for this man?

68
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:25,925
I might have a chance of curing him.
I've been experimenting with animals.

69
00:06:26,092 --> 00:06:28,928
But what works with animals
may not with a human being.

70
00:06:29,095 --> 00:06:32,223
-Your chemicals may be deadly.
-Not one animal has died.

71
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:35,727
It might. It's too dangerous,
too far outside of known medicine.

72
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:39,105
-But I'm no witch doctor.
-Who's called you a witch doctor?

73
00:06:39,272 --> 00:06:41,733
You told me yourself
it still had to be proved.

74
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:45,195
I can't allow you to experiment with--
Why, after all...

75
00:06:45,362 --> 00:06:48,615
-...the man's a human being!
-You mean he was a human being...

76
00:06:48,782 --> 00:06:53,536
...and he may be again, if you'd keep ethics
out of this! Sometimes we have to gamble.

77
00:06:53,703 --> 00:06:56,414
Or haven't you the courage to face
the most daring--

78
00:06:56,623 --> 00:07:01,252
Jekyll, I wouldn't talk these experiments
around very openly if I were you.

79
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:04,756
You're dealing with things
it would be better not to mention.

80
00:07:04,923 --> 00:07:08,134
-There might be trouble.
-Trouble?

81
00:07:08,301 --> 00:07:10,095
Trouble!

82
00:07:15,558 --> 00:07:18,895
Harry, old boy, there are rumors of....
What's the matter?

83
00:07:19,062 --> 00:07:22,607
-Don't worry, John, I'm leaving.
-Now, it can't be as bad as that.

84
00:07:22,774 --> 00:07:25,819
John, my good friend, I realize
your Dr. Heath is right.

85
00:07:25,986 --> 00:07:28,863
After all, we doctors can't
experiment on human beings.

86
00:07:29,030 --> 00:07:32,784
Something might go wrong, and they'd
no longer believe in our medicine.

87
00:07:32,993 --> 00:07:35,829
-Now, look here--
-But when I get proof, ethics or no--

88
00:07:35,996 --> 00:07:38,164
I wanna be on hand, regardless.

89
00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:50,218
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Just in time for tea, sir.

90
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:52,804
I'll be bound you had no lunch, sir.

91
00:07:52,971 --> 00:07:56,975
Now, what about some nice
hot crumpets, sir, huh?

92
00:07:57,142 --> 00:08:00,312
Of course, we mustn't spoil
our appetite for dinner tonight.

93
00:08:00,478 --> 00:08:03,606
Miss Beatrix would be after me
properly if we did that, sir.

94
00:08:03,773 --> 00:08:10,238
And besides, Mrs. Marley's butler tells me
that their new cook is really first-class, sir.

95
00:08:11,698 --> 00:08:14,367
Sir, what about your tea, sir?

96
00:08:18,371 --> 00:08:20,498
Shall I serve it down there, sir?

97
00:08:20,665 --> 00:08:23,835
Now, look here, sir, you must have
something, you know.

98
00:09:52,132 --> 00:09:53,925
Mrs. Marley, my deepest apologies.

99
00:09:54,134 --> 00:09:57,053
You doctors.
I know we can never rely on you.

100
00:09:57,220 --> 00:10:01,308
You know, I don't mind being scolded
by the smartest hostess in London.

101
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:04,519
-Dr. Jekyll, do sit over there.
-Thank you. Good evening.

102
00:10:04,686 --> 00:10:09,065
Giles. Colonel. My special apologies
to you, Lady Colburn.

103
00:10:09,232 --> 00:10:10,775
Pleasurer.

104
00:10:11,276 --> 00:10:12,610
-Behaving yourself?
-No.

105
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:16,448
-A doctor's life, huh, Harry?
-The more patients, the colder the soup.

106
00:10:18,283 --> 00:10:21,453
Actually, I got started on something
and lost track of time.

107
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:23,705
Oh, yes, Jekyll.

108
00:10:23,872 --> 00:10:28,126
Heath was telling me that you're still
carrying on with that research work.

109
00:10:28,335 --> 00:10:32,422
-Dr. Heath isn't in sympathy, Dr. Courtland.
-That's understandable, isn't it?

110
00:10:32,589 --> 00:10:37,594
After all, separating the facets of the brain.
Rather ambitious, I should call that.

111
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:42,223
His research goes deeper than the brain into
something more intangible than the mind.

112
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:48,229
-Then all that seems to be left is the soul.
-All right, then, call it the soul.

113
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:49,606
The soul?

114
00:10:49,773 --> 00:10:53,485
Come, come, my dear doctor.
Now you're invading my territory.

115
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:56,488
I suppose I am, but I know
that you wouldn't object...

116
00:10:56,655 --> 00:10:58,990
...if science could be of help
to the church.

117
00:10:59,157 --> 00:11:01,951
The church is always grateful
for any help, doctor.

118
00:11:02,118 --> 00:11:05,664
Harry doesn't mean a word of this.
I'm afraid he's pulling our leg.

119
00:11:05,872 --> 00:11:10,335
I should hope so. I was wondering what
Jekyll would do if I asked him to elaborate.

120
00:11:10,543 --> 00:11:12,754
I don't mind elaborating.

121
00:11:12,921 --> 00:11:17,801
If you didn't see that poor chap in church
this morning, you heard him, I'm sure.

122
00:11:18,385 --> 00:11:19,928
Thank you for your assistance.

123
00:11:20,095 --> 00:11:23,682
-Hopelessly insane, obviously.
-I don't think he was insane.

124
00:11:23,848 --> 00:11:26,810
I think there was only one side of him
expressing itself.

125
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:30,105
-Good heavens, which side?
-His evil side.

126
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:32,816
The man was spiritually distorted
through shock.

127
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:35,944
That explosion in the gas main last month.

128
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:38,446
Before that, he was a fine, solid citizen...

129
00:11:38,613 --> 00:11:41,658
...kind with his children,
deeply in love with his wife.

130
00:11:41,825 --> 00:11:44,369
Since then, he had undergone
a complete change...

131
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:48,206
...until this afternoon I found him
completely reverted to the animal.

132
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:51,376
We can clearly understand a shock
to the nervous system...

133
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:53,545
... but how does that affect the soul?

134
00:11:53,712 --> 00:11:57,299
I think he was shocked
from normal good into complete evil.

135
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:01,886
When I say he was a good man,
I don't mean he hadn't had a bad thought.

136
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:06,141
Or that he hadn't committed ordinary
transgressions against society.

137
00:12:06,474 --> 00:12:10,061
But, after all, that's the problem
of civilized man's soul, isn't it?

138
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,148
That good and evil are constantly
fighting one another?

139
00:12:13,315 --> 00:12:16,901
There's a higher source from which
good can find aid in its fight.

140
00:12:17,068 --> 00:12:18,320
I realize that, but--

141
00:12:18,486 --> 00:12:23,074
The colonel and I have always felt that
a person can be good if they wish to be.

142
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:28,496
-And, well, otherwise if they don't.
-Jekyll, I simply must get this straight.

143
00:12:28,663 --> 00:12:30,665
Well, let me put it this way:

144
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:34,336
Good and evil are so close as to be
chained together in the soul.

145
00:12:34,502 --> 00:12:38,173
Now, suppose we could break that chain,
separate those two selves...

146
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:42,802
...free the good in man, and let it go to its
higher destiny and segregate the bad.

147
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:47,057
But aren't you a bit presumptuous
in assuming that there's evil in all men?

148
00:12:47,223 --> 00:12:51,603
But isn't that true? Wouldn't we be
hypocrites if we didn't admit that?

149
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:56,274
After all, we've all had thoughts that we
didn't want published or shouted out loud.

150
00:12:56,483 --> 00:13:00,320
And we certainly have had desires
that are not confined to a drawing room.

151
00:13:00,487 --> 00:13:03,448
Why, as Christians, we admit
that man is created weak.

152
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:06,534
That's a perfectly honest problem.
Why don't we face it?

153
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:11,539
Suppose we believe that man's soul
has not yet reached its fulfillment.

154
00:13:11,706 --> 00:13:15,043
Is it wise--? Is it right to tamper
with the problem...

155
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:19,464
...until the Creator himself has solved it
in his own mysterious way?

156
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:22,133
-Sir, l--
-Really, this is very disturbing.

157
00:13:22,342 --> 00:13:25,053
Such theories come dangerously close to....

158
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:28,181
I hesitate to think what the medical
council would say--

159
00:13:28,348 --> 00:13:33,436
Dr. Courtland, advanced theories are always
a sore point with the medical council.

160
00:13:33,603 --> 00:13:37,524
Or even with the queen's physician,
if there's a comfortable profit...

161
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:40,777
-...in those already established.
-Jekyll!

162
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:45,490
If you ask my opinion, young man,
this is pure balderdash.

163
00:13:46,199 --> 00:13:48,201
-Ladies.
-I meant to ask:

164
00:13:48,368 --> 00:13:52,122
Has anyone read that poem
by this new chap Oscar Wilde?

165
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,274
-Getting old, I suppose.
-Well, it's pretty late.

166
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,736
-We ought to--
-No. Come in and have a nightcap, John.

167
00:14:22,902 --> 00:14:25,030
The rest of the company won't be bored.

168
00:14:25,238 --> 00:14:26,990
Well, thank you, sir.

169
00:14:35,915 --> 00:14:37,500
Look.

170
00:15:03,234 --> 00:15:06,613
It's the waltz that he and Mama
first danced together.

171
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:18,166
May I have this dance, Miss Beatrix?

172
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:20,752
Pleasure, Dr. Jekyll.

173
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,033
-Bea, darling.
-Harry.

174
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,953
I love you so very much, Bea.

175
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,377
Oh, Harry.

176
00:16:04,129 --> 00:16:08,842
T onight at dinner, I understood what you
said about the good and evil in people...

177
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:11,177
...and how it's that way in all of us.

178
00:16:11,344 --> 00:16:12,637
But....

179
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,139
Well, why isn't...?

180
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:17,559
Why isn't the way you and l
feel about each other?

181
00:16:18,518 --> 00:16:21,521
I mean, there's nothing evil
in that, is there?

182
00:16:21,688 --> 00:16:25,567
-Do you think there is?
-No. No, Harry.

183
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,362
-Bea, we're in love, aren't we?
-Yes, we're very much in love.

184
00:16:29,529 --> 00:16:31,573
That's all the difference.

185
00:16:37,787 --> 00:16:40,498
Oh, my dear, John is looking
for a piece of music...

186
00:16:40,665 --> 00:16:43,501
... The Banks of Loch Lomond,
will you help him find it?

187
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:45,795
-Yes, Father.
-Thank you.

188
00:16:46,212 --> 00:16:47,839
Harry....

189
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:53,261
I'm not one to brood, but you must have
noticed my concern in the carriage.

190
00:16:53,428 --> 00:16:54,596
I just thought that--

191
00:16:54,763 --> 00:16:59,017
That flight of fancy you put forth at dinner,
I must confess, it startled me.

192
00:16:59,225 --> 00:17:02,354
Although I'm broad-minded myself,
it was a bit shocking too.

193
00:17:02,562 --> 00:17:06,399
I'm sorry to hear you say that, sir,
because it was not a flight of fancy.

194
00:17:06,566 --> 00:17:10,528
-You mean, you were in earnest?
-Profoundly, sir. As a matter of fact...

195
00:17:10,695 --> 00:17:13,698
-... I hope to spend all of my time--
-This is distressing.

196
00:17:13,907 --> 00:17:15,158
Why?

197
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:17,827
In my opinion,
the whole thing's harebrained.

198
00:17:18,036 --> 00:17:20,914
Well, I'm sorry to hear you
say that, sir. I--

199
00:17:21,081 --> 00:17:24,584
You're a coming man in your profession.
I'm very proud of you.

200
00:17:24,751 --> 00:17:29,506
But these ridiculous experiments won't get
you anywhere. You must give them up.

201
00:17:29,839 --> 00:17:34,052
Develop your practice, cultivate the circle
in which you and Beatrix shall move.

202
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:38,765
Harry, my boy, I've always wanted a son,
and now you're going to be that.

203
00:17:38,932 --> 00:17:43,186
Now, I've had my say. Let's have
your nightcap. It's getting late.

204
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:48,358
And by the way, I've taken a box
for the opening concert at Albert Hall.

205
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,568
You'll join us, of course.

206
00:17:55,448 --> 00:17:59,577
-So you and the old boy cross swords?
-Yes.

207
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:04,124
Seems I must discontinue my research,
spend my life diagnosing measles...

208
00:18:04,291 --> 00:18:08,253
...mumps, and whooping cough
or encounter his serious disapproval.

209
00:18:08,461 --> 00:18:12,757
Even I was surprised when you took
a Marley dinner party into your confidence.

210
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:16,052
You need not agree with me,
I just have a decision to make.

211
00:18:16,219 --> 00:18:18,638
Harry, you and l
have been friends for years.

212
00:18:18,805 --> 00:18:22,809
I can't agree with you, but that doesn't
make a difference to our friendship.

213
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,270
Let's drop into the club.
It'll do you good.

214
00:18:25,478 --> 00:18:27,397
Well, I'll walk that far with you.

215
00:18:31,943 --> 00:18:35,280
Let me go! You thug! Let me go!

216
00:18:36,656 --> 00:18:40,327
Help me! Help me!

217
00:18:46,124 --> 00:18:48,335
Let him go. Let him go.

218
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,464
-You get a cab. I'll see what's happened.
-Yes.

219
00:18:56,176 --> 00:19:00,764
A girl can't walk out with a chap.
Who does he think he is?

220
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,849
-The big--
-Did he hurt you?

221
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,435
It'll take more than a bloke like that to....

222
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:19,741
Why, I bet I look ever so untidy.

223
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:22,118
You sure you're not hurt?

224
00:19:22,285 --> 00:19:25,997
Why, l....
I don't think so.

225
00:19:30,877 --> 00:19:34,798
-What is it? Your ankle?
-Yeah. It's twisted.

226
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:38,343
Do you mind?

227
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:41,221
No, not at all.

228
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:45,725
-After all, an ankle can be very painful.
-You are ever so kind.

229
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:51,147
Me side too. He hit me.

230
00:19:51,314 --> 00:19:53,483
Well, I should have caught him.

231
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,652
No, no.

232
00:19:55,819 --> 00:19:57,320
I'm....

233
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:59,781
I mean, I'm so glad you stopped.

234
00:20:00,615 --> 00:20:02,951
If you take my meaning.

235
00:20:06,871 --> 00:20:10,917
My friend is getting a cab.
Perhaps we could drop you somewhere.

236
00:20:11,084 --> 00:20:14,212
-You're ever so kind.
-Shall we try it now?

237
00:20:14,421 --> 00:20:16,298
There. That's a girl.

238
00:20:16,464 --> 00:20:20,176
Gentlemen like you shouldn't be
bothering yourself about me.

239
00:20:20,593 --> 00:20:24,055
Now, what sort of a gentleman
doesn't like to help a pretty girl?

240
00:20:25,348 --> 00:20:27,225
Now.

241
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,562
And me with me hat all over me head.

242
00:20:31,229 --> 00:20:34,691
So he asks me if he can
walk me home, he does.

243
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:37,777
Well, I turns around
to him, and I says, "Yes."

244
00:20:37,944 --> 00:20:41,948
When a girl is out late, it's nice to have
a bit of company to see her home.

245
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,742
Naturally.

246
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,704
Well, I know what's what.

247
00:20:47,871 --> 00:20:52,584
You have to if you are a barmaid.
I like a bit of fun, as the saying goes...

248
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:56,046
...but when a bloke grabs you
with nasty notions in his head...

249
00:20:56,212 --> 00:20:58,590
...it's time to put your foot down.

250
00:21:04,512 --> 00:21:06,014
I'm....

251
00:21:06,181 --> 00:21:09,100
I'm sorry to bother you gentlemen.

252
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:14,606
Well, here we are.

253
00:21:23,531 --> 00:21:27,369
-lt hurts more now.
-Does it?

254
00:21:30,121 --> 00:21:32,874
-Can I give a hand, Harry?
-No, I think I can manage.

255
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,210
I'm so sorry.

256
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,880
-Night.
-Night.

257
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,302
Here?

258
00:21:56,231 --> 00:21:58,900
The light's by the door,
if you have a match.

259
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:00,443
Right.

260
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:16,501
You better let down your blouse.

261
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:19,004
Why?

262
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:21,923
Well, you want me to have
a look at you, don't you?

263
00:22:23,216 --> 00:22:24,592
I don't know.

264
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:29,681
You are looking, ain't you?

265
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,436
Well, how about your side?

266
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:39,441
Do you want to look at my side?

267
00:22:40,233 --> 00:22:42,235
Well, don't you want me to?

268
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:02,631
You aren't half a fast one, aren't you?

269
00:23:02,797 --> 00:23:06,259
I forgot to mention,
my friend and I are physicians.

270
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:09,387
Physi-- Physicians?

271
00:23:10,722 --> 00:23:12,390
Doctors.

272
00:23:13,099 --> 00:23:14,768
Doctors?

273
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,563
Oh, go on!

274
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:22,317
I thought you were a couple of toffs.

275
00:23:23,443 --> 00:23:26,029
No, no. Haven't the leisure.

276
00:23:26,196 --> 00:23:30,367
Oh, dear me.
And here I thought....

277
00:23:40,502 --> 00:23:44,381
-Well, I'm glad to see you're not really hurt.
-But I am, doctor.

278
00:23:44,547 --> 00:23:47,133
-Really.
-Maybe I better send you to the hospital?

279
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,468
No.

280
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,721
Look. Here. Feel.

281
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:53,515
-Feel.
-Where? Here?

282
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,729
Just as I thought: Cirrhosis pectoris.

283
00:24:01,147 --> 00:24:03,024
What's that mean?

284
00:24:03,191 --> 00:24:06,444
That means your eyes
are twin pools of desire.

285
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,157
Oh, doctor.

286
00:24:11,866 --> 00:24:13,827
That's nice.

287
00:24:14,077 --> 00:24:16,788
The things you do say.

288
00:24:18,832 --> 00:24:21,001
That doesn't hurt anymore, huh?

289
00:24:21,668 --> 00:24:23,336
Oh, yes.

290
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:26,506
-Yes. Yes.
-You'll be all right in the morning.

291
00:24:26,673 --> 00:24:28,300
Wait!

292
00:24:29,009 --> 00:24:30,510
Wait.

293
00:24:34,514 --> 00:24:36,141
My ankle.

294
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,893
Don't you think you ought
to look at that?

295
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,150
No.

296
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,986
No, your ankle's all right.

297
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:53,658
But I'll tell you one thing.
You wear your garter too tight.

298
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:57,954
-That stops the circulation. That's bad.
-There, you see?

299
00:24:58,121 --> 00:25:00,248
You did find something.

300
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,168
You are my doctor, aren't you?

301
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:06,546
I ought to pay your fee, oughtn't l?

302
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,966
I haven't presented you with a bill yet.

303
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:16,765
How about this to begin with?

304
00:25:16,931 --> 00:25:18,933
Not that it's enough.

305
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,727
It's fine. It's fine.

306
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,396
It's much more than most people pay.

307
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:27,567
It doesn't seem near enough to me.

308
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,532
Harry, listen--

309
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,160
Oh, sorry.

310
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:40,372
Come along, will you?
It's getting late.

311
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:44,751
Well....

312
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:46,878
But....

313
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,632
But you aren't really going
just because he says?

314
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,551
No, no, no.
But I have to go now.

315
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,262
But look here.
Don't you understand?

316
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,223
I ain't no....

317
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:01,017
I ain't no....

318
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:04,312
No, I know you're not.
You're a girl with her heart...

319
00:26:04,479 --> 00:26:07,565
...just where it ought to be.
Maybe a little too generous.

320
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,027
Because you're a nice, pretty girl,
next time be more careful...

321
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:13,071
...about the company you pick, huh?

322
00:26:13,697 --> 00:26:15,407
Well, but....

323
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,033
But you are here, ain't you?

324
00:26:18,785 --> 00:26:20,787
Yes, but I shouldn't be.

325
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:24,165
And if you really knew me,
you'd know I don't wanna be.

326
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:27,168
Well, l....

327
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:30,505
I picks only them
as wants my company.

328
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:34,175
-I'm sorry. It was my fault.
-What you sorry about?

329
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:36,386
I am not.

330
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,723
Then let's just say
that we were foolish...

331
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,268
...and next time we'll drink
to one another's health.

332
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:46,229
I suppose it was all in fun
when you kissed me.

333
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,940
Yes.

334
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,860
It wasn't all in fun then.
I know that.

335
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:09,377
Well, goodbye and good luck.

336
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:34,319
Come on, John. Don't be stuffy.

337
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:37,447
After all, the lady wasn't injured,
nor was anyone else.

338
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:41,159
I imagine she might be a tempting
morsel in an off moment.

339
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,996
-What do you mean, "off moment"?
-Yours, according to your theory.

340
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:47,040
I imagine what I just witnessed...

341
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:51,544
...was the momentary triumph of the evil
in your soul over the good, huh? Correct?

342
00:27:51,711 --> 00:27:57,342
Yes, yes. I don't think it was a triumph,
but it was an attack.

343
00:27:57,926 --> 00:28:01,513
But one which would have been repulsed
even without your help, John.

344
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:05,392
Wouldn't you run less risk if you
confined your experiments to the lab?

345
00:28:07,727 --> 00:28:10,563
That's where you'll find me
from tonight on...

346
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:12,732
...until I get what I'm looking for.

347
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:47,702
I'm worried, John.

348
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:51,456
-He ought to have let us know.
-He'll be along.

349
00:30:24,114 --> 00:30:27,367
Maybe it's all for the best, Dr. Jekyll.

350
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:29,160
That wasn't my son in there.

351
00:30:29,327 --> 00:30:31,997
It was as if the evil one
had crept into his heart.

352
00:30:32,163 --> 00:30:34,499
My poor Sam.

353
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,460
-Burke, take Mrs. Higgins home.
-Yes, sir.

354
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,505
-I'll walk.
-Oh, thank you, Dr. Jekyll.

355
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:43,091
-Thank you.
-Good night, Mrs. Higgins.

356
00:30:43,258 --> 00:30:46,344
Good night, doctor. Good night.

357
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:54,936
-Hello, Dr. Jekyll. How are you?
-Good evening, Mr. Weller.

358
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:57,272
Just in time, sir.

359
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,316
Just locking up.

360
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:04,696
Wait half a moment until I fix this thing over
here, I'll walk up to the east gate with you.

361
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:08,033
Wonderful nights we're having, sir.

362
00:31:08,241 --> 00:31:12,746
And don't you believe about this here comet
and the "world coming to an end" business.

363
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,457
If you ask me,
it don't amount to a row of beans.

364
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,918
Newspaper talk, that's what I calls it.
Don't you believe it.

365
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:23,465
Just step down to Lloyd's and take out an
insurance policy and it won't cost you...

366
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:27,093
...more than it did last week when
there was no talk of a comet...

367
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,012
...or the world running into one.

368
00:31:29,179 --> 00:31:33,725
Those are fellows that know what they're
talking about, sir. You take that from me.

369
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,518
Mr. Weller, here's a point.

370
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:39,606
If you had a balloon that carried a man
to Mars and the pilot you picked...

371
00:31:39,773 --> 00:31:43,777
...suddenly disappeared, would you
get in the balloon yourself and cast off?

372
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:45,403
A balloon?

373
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,406
Well, that's a good one, sir.
I think you got me there.

374
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:52,202
I don't know though. If I had a balloon
that would take me there...

375
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:56,247
...and back, mind you, I don't know
that I wouldn't have a go at it.

376
00:31:56,414 --> 00:31:59,167
Might get me away
from me mother-in-law for a while.

377
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,462
How's that for an answer, Dr. Jekyll?

378
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:06,091
Fair enough, Mr. Weller. Fair enough.

379
00:32:33,326 --> 00:32:34,995
Yes?

380
00:32:35,161 --> 00:32:36,913
What?

381
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:41,042
Oh.

382
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:45,422
Oh, no.

383
00:36:49,249 --> 00:36:51,251
Can this be evil?

384
00:36:57,090 --> 00:36:58,842
Dr. Jekyll.

385
00:37:00,635 --> 00:37:02,053
Dr. Jekyll?

386
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:06,182
-What's happening, sir? Are you all right?
-What is it? What do you want?

387
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,018
Is that you, Dr. Jekyll?

388
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,061
Now, wait a minute.

389
00:37:10,603 --> 00:37:12,480
Wait a minute, Poole.

390
00:37:18,403 --> 00:37:22,240
Dr. Jekyll, who is that in there?

391
00:37:27,412 --> 00:37:30,081
Dr. Jekyll, answer me, sir.

392
00:38:03,490 --> 00:38:04,908
Yes, Poole?

393
00:38:05,533 --> 00:38:07,494
I'm sorry, sir, but l....

394
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:12,165
I heard an odd noise and a strange voice.
I thought something was happening, sir.

395
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,960
No, no, no. It's quite all right, Poole.

396
00:38:15,168 --> 00:38:18,463
There was someone here.
A friend of mine.

397
00:38:18,672 --> 00:38:20,090
A Mr. Hyde.

398
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,258
I let him out the back door.

399
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:24,761
Oh, I see, sir. Very good, sir.

400
00:38:24,928 --> 00:38:27,639
Miss Beatrix is here, sir.

401
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:30,058
I showed her into
the consulting room, sir.

402
00:38:30,225 --> 00:38:32,310
I hope I did right, sir.

403
00:38:32,769 --> 00:38:35,647
Yes, yes, that was quite right, Poole.

404
00:38:37,691 --> 00:38:39,985
Tell Miss Beatrix
I'll be there immediately.

405
00:38:40,402 --> 00:38:42,320
Very good, sir.

406
00:39:41,838 --> 00:39:43,590
Harry.

407
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:48,887
What are you doing here, Bea?

408
00:39:49,054 --> 00:39:53,725
-Oh, Harry, then you're not....
-Not what?

409
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:56,895
Oh, I don't know.

410
00:39:57,437 --> 00:39:58,980
I had the strangest feeling.

411
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:01,900
-I thought--
-Yes? You thought?

412
00:40:02,776 --> 00:40:04,903
That you were going away...

413
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:08,073
...without ever seeing me again.

414
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:10,325
Well, why would I do that, Bea?

415
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:12,911
-I love you. Why....
-Oh, I know.

416
00:40:13,161 --> 00:40:15,038
But I lost you for a moment, Harry.

417
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:18,625
-I was afraid.
-But you're not afraid now?

418
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:20,377
Of course not.

419
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:22,879
Well, you see that everything's all right...

420
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:26,758
...nothing has happened,
that I'm the same as I ever was?

421
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,969
Of course.

422
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:32,722
-lt must have been a dream.
-Yes, yes, a dream.

423
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:34,641
You're not angry with me?

424
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:36,685
Angry?

425
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:41,022
Oh, I don't want you to leave me. Ever.

426
00:40:41,189 --> 00:40:42,607
Oh, darling.

427
00:40:42,816 --> 00:40:44,943
I love you so much.

428
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:48,196
-Please don't send me away.
-No.

429
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,455
Yes, Father?

430
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:07,632
It's a good thing I was worried about your
behavior tonight. I couldn't sleep myself.

431
00:41:07,841 --> 00:41:12,637
Sir Charles, I know it's strange to find
Beatrix here but I want you to believe that--

432
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:16,599
All I can believe is that your ideas
are not normal, Jekyll, not fit--

433
00:41:16,766 --> 00:41:19,853
Sir Charles, I asked Beatrix
to come here tonight because--

434
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,646
No, Harry.

435
00:41:21,855 --> 00:41:26,151
Father, I know my being here is difficult
to understand, but I'm not ashamed.

436
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:31,156
Then, my dear, I shall be for you,
because I do understand.

437
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:34,534
We leave for the Continent
tomorrow on the boat train.

438
00:41:34,701 --> 00:41:35,827
Father, please.

439
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:40,040
Oh, come, Sir Charles. After all,
you could eliminate all this difficulty...

440
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:42,667
...if you'd set an early date
for our marriage.

441
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:46,379
You don't understand. We're very much
in love. We wanna be together.

442
00:41:46,546 --> 00:41:49,007
-We don't wanna wait any longer.
-Please, Father.

443
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:52,677
In view of what's happened,
the engagement should be broken off.

444
00:41:52,886 --> 00:41:56,640
However, I'll be lenient. We shall see you
on our return. Come, my dear.

445
00:41:56,806 --> 00:42:00,685
Father, I've never
disobeyed you in my life.

446
00:42:01,770 --> 00:42:04,814
But, Harry,
if you don't want me to leave...

447
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,358
... I'll refuse.

448
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:09,861
-Beatrix.
-I mean it, Father.

449
00:42:12,781 --> 00:42:14,991
I don't want you to go, Bea...

450
00:42:15,158 --> 00:42:18,453
...and I can't agree with your
father's decision, but I know...

451
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:23,541
...he's thinking of your happiness. I can't
argue against that and I can't ask you to.

452
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,378
That's highly commendable, Harry.

453
00:42:27,921 --> 00:42:30,966
Will you see us off at the train?

454
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:35,220
Better have two engines.
I might try to hold it back.

455
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,432
Try. Try anyway.

456
00:43:04,624 --> 00:43:07,294
A glass of sherry wine, sir?

457
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:08,962
No. No, thanks.

458
00:43:09,129 --> 00:43:13,258
Well, would you consider
a letter from Monte Carlo, sir?

459
00:43:16,303 --> 00:43:19,723
-I'll take the sherry wine too.
-Yes, sir.

460
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:23,852
Miss Beatrix should be returning home
soon now, shouldn't she?

461
00:43:24,019 --> 00:43:26,021
Yes. Yes, Poole.

462
00:43:27,564 --> 00:43:31,067
Hobson was telling me
that they were expected.

463
00:43:52,631 --> 00:43:54,674
Bad news, sir?

464
00:43:55,216 --> 00:43:58,553
Miss Beatrix and her father
are going to Aix-les-Bains.

465
00:43:59,512 --> 00:44:01,473
Oh, I'm sorry, sir.

466
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,600
Sir Charles'health, no doubt?

467
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:06,144
Yes, yes.

468
00:44:06,686 --> 00:44:09,189
Yes, Sir Charles'health, no doubt.

469
00:44:17,113 --> 00:44:21,743
If you'll forgive me, sir,
it upsets me to see you like this.

470
00:44:21,910 --> 00:44:23,578
It isn't right.

471
00:44:23,745 --> 00:44:26,581
All work, as the saying goes, sir.

472
00:44:27,415 --> 00:44:32,003
They say there's a very interesting
musical show at the vanity fair, sir.

473
00:44:32,212 --> 00:44:34,339
Very comical, you know, sir.

474
00:44:34,547 --> 00:44:40,345
And very daring,
if you follow my meaning, sir.

475
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:45,350
Yeah, I follow your meaning, Poole.

476
00:44:45,517 --> 00:44:49,813
But I don't think it would be wise,
even though it is comical.

477
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:51,481
Quite so, sir.

478
00:44:51,648 --> 00:44:55,860
-I'll fetch you another glass, sir.
-Oh, never mind, Poole.

479
00:47:32,058 --> 00:47:35,729
Thanks for the pay, sir.
Hey, hey, hey!

480
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:39,149
Here. What's the idea, governor?

481
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:42,027
Oh, I beg your pardon, sir.

482
00:47:52,871 --> 00:47:54,748
Yes, sir?

483
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:58,209
Box F, sir. Right this way.

484
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:32,744
Now, all together, boys.

485
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:03,608
Two pints.

486
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:40,020
Oh, oh.

487
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:42,814
A tip. A tip, of course.

488
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:46,776
Seven shillings, sir? Why....

489
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:50,363
-Why not? You work hard, don't you?
-Yes, sir. Bless you, sir.

490
00:49:50,530 --> 00:49:55,493
-You have a family, no doubt.
-Yes. Yes, sir. Thank you.

491
00:49:57,370 --> 00:49:59,164
-Did you hurt yourself?
-What the--?

492
00:49:59,372 --> 00:50:01,625
Oh, what a pity.

493
00:50:01,791 --> 00:50:04,294
You were thinking of the children,
no doubt?

494
00:50:04,461 --> 00:50:06,921
Now, have that barmaid
bring me some champagne.

495
00:50:07,088 --> 00:50:11,343
-lvy ain't allowed to leave the bar.
-I don't think you understood what I said.

496
00:50:11,509 --> 00:50:14,679
-What's all this here?
-This gent here wants champagne, sir.

497
00:50:14,846 --> 00:50:17,265
Champagne?
All right, then, bring it, bring it.

498
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:20,936
-But he wants lvy to serve it.
-Of course lvy will serve it. Go on.

499
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:22,854
Look lively.

500
00:50:24,689 --> 00:50:28,902
A gent in box F wants you to serve him,
and Old Prouty says you're to do it.

501
00:50:29,069 --> 00:50:31,571
Oh, he does?
I'll tell him it ain't my business.

502
00:50:31,738 --> 00:50:33,698
But he wants a bottle of the boil.

503
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:37,285
Oh, bubbly. Why didn't you say so?

504
00:50:37,452 --> 00:50:41,498
Hey, lvy, me love, how about some
fish and chips after the show?

505
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:45,335
How about a dozen oysters
and a pint of stout?

506
00:50:47,629 --> 00:50:50,382
What about a glass of champagne?

507
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:54,761
-Oh, hello, Marcia.
-Hello, lvy.

508
00:50:57,764 --> 00:50:59,057
Watch out, lvy.

509
00:50:59,265 --> 00:51:01,393
How's about it, lvy?

510
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:03,395
Over there, lvy.

511
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:05,730
Ain't she a bit of horseflesh?

512
00:51:39,556 --> 00:51:41,057
Well, that'll....

513
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:42,934
That'll be half a quid, sir.

514
00:51:44,102 --> 00:51:45,437
Half a quid?

515
00:51:45,979 --> 00:51:48,023
Yes, sir.

516
00:51:48,398 --> 00:51:50,275
Half a quid.

517
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:52,193
Here.

518
00:51:52,360 --> 00:51:55,405
Here's a sovereign, my dear.
Keep the change.

519
00:51:55,864 --> 00:51:57,907
Thank you, sir.

520
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:02,412
Oh, but you're not going?
Oh, no. No.

521
00:52:02,579 --> 00:52:05,123
After all, you brought two glasses.

522
00:52:05,332 --> 00:52:07,834
Two minds with but a single thought.

523
00:52:08,001 --> 00:52:10,086
My, what a nice beginning.

524
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:13,256
Sit down there.
Sit right down.

525
00:52:13,465 --> 00:52:15,508
Well, l....

526
00:52:16,217 --> 00:52:18,136
Well, I'll just take a sip.

527
00:52:18,303 --> 00:52:21,931
-Of course, I shouldn't stay too long.
-Oh, nonsense. Nonsense.

528
00:52:22,098 --> 00:52:23,850
You can stay as long as you like.

529
00:52:24,017 --> 00:52:26,811
After all, we have all evening,
haven't we?

530
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,689
Of course we have. Here.

531
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:31,733
There.

532
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:34,402
Oh, I like your singing.

533
00:52:34,569 --> 00:52:38,490
Yes. You must sing again
for me sometime.

534
00:52:38,907 --> 00:52:41,785
Where did you get such a pretty voice?

535
00:52:47,123 --> 00:52:48,458
Well, I don't know.

536
00:52:49,584 --> 00:52:53,338
-I just--
-Perhaps it's the pretty place it comes from?

537
00:52:54,673 --> 00:52:57,008
-Well--
-Very lovely, where it comes from.

538
00:52:57,175 --> 00:53:01,638
-Well, here's health so good luck.
-I make my own luck, my dear.

539
00:53:01,888 --> 00:53:04,975
Yes, and tonight I follow the rainbow.

540
00:53:09,396 --> 00:53:12,107
Oh, you don't half talk, do you?

541
00:53:12,274 --> 00:53:14,526
Perhaps we could follow it together?

542
00:53:14,693 --> 00:53:18,613
-I'll follow it right home, mister.
-To that rattrap?

543
00:53:18,780 --> 00:53:23,034
-Hey, what are you calling names?
-Well, I think you deserve something better.

544
00:53:24,703 --> 00:53:26,329
How do you know where I live?

545
00:53:26,913 --> 00:53:29,291
Well, I can imagine.

546
00:53:29,457 --> 00:53:33,878
Surely your wages here
don't earn you a place in Barkley Square.

547
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:40,385
Well, I think I'll be off.

548
00:53:41,469 --> 00:53:45,515
Why? I don't confuse you, do l, lvy?

549
00:53:46,766 --> 00:53:49,394
I believe I do confuse you, don't l?

550
00:53:49,561 --> 00:53:52,355
I ain't confused by nobody.

551
00:53:53,690 --> 00:53:55,692
Let go. Do you hear?

552
00:54:04,326 --> 00:54:06,119
Let go.

553
00:54:12,334 --> 00:54:13,877
Let go, you hear?

554
00:54:14,044 --> 00:54:16,630
-What's he doing, lvy?
-Oh, you let go too!

555
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:18,757
Watch out, lvy love.

556
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:22,844
-Here, here. What's this all about?
-lt's him. He insulted her.

557
00:54:23,011 --> 00:54:25,805
-He's lying, I tell you!
-He tried to break her arm.

558
00:54:25,972 --> 00:54:28,850
-He did, did he?
-Yes, yes. Tried to break her arm.

559
00:54:29,643 --> 00:54:32,103
You will? You want another one?

560
00:54:38,818 --> 00:54:41,529
No! No! Stop it! Stop it!

561
00:54:41,696 --> 00:54:43,239
I'll stop it, sir.

562
00:54:43,406 --> 00:54:46,910
Hey, boys! Now, boys!
Boys, will you--?

563
00:55:06,262 --> 00:55:09,224
I can't understand what happened.
Never a rumpus here.

564
00:55:09,391 --> 00:55:11,393
Most orderly.

565
00:55:11,851 --> 00:55:15,480
It's that girl, lvy, that barmaid.
Pretty girls always cause trouble.

566
00:55:15,647 --> 00:55:20,318
-I'd throw her out if I were you.
-What? Ivy? I can't do that to lvy.

567
00:55:20,485 --> 00:55:23,655
A great man can always
change his mind...

568
00:55:23,822 --> 00:55:25,699
...for a reason.

569
00:55:25,865 --> 00:55:28,326
Yes, sir. Why, certainly, sir. Yes, sir.

570
00:55:28,493 --> 00:55:30,996
A troublemaker, that's what she is.
Out she goes.

571
00:55:31,204 --> 00:55:34,165
Yes, but now,
while the evening is still young.

572
00:55:34,332 --> 00:55:37,460
-Yes, sir. Certainly, sir.
-Yes, certainly.

573
00:55:39,546 --> 00:55:43,174
What happened? I've done nothing.
Just minding my own business.

574
00:55:43,341 --> 00:55:45,844
-That's my decision, my girl.
-Stop pushing!

575
00:55:46,011 --> 00:55:48,346
-Don't hang about here.
-Who's hanging about?

576
00:55:48,513 --> 00:55:51,933
-Go on. Don't argue the point.
-Oh, good riddance.

577
00:55:53,643 --> 00:55:55,979
What's happened in there?

578
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:03,528
-ls there some trouble, lvy?
-Trouble? I was sacked, that's what!

579
00:56:03,737 --> 00:56:06,197
How fortunate I'm here.
I'd like to help you.

580
00:56:06,364 --> 00:56:09,826
Let me back in there so I can bash him
on the nose, that's all!

581
00:56:10,535 --> 00:56:16,041
Quite the little Tartar, aren't you?
Always ready to flare up. Oh, I like that.

582
00:56:16,249 --> 00:56:21,379
Here, here. This is just to prove
that I want to help you.

583
00:56:37,187 --> 00:56:40,440
The rainbow is wide and long, lvy.

584
00:56:41,399 --> 00:56:45,820
-Oh, now wait. I better get home.
-No, no, no.

585
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:52,369
Ivy, my darling,
you belong with the immortals.

586
00:56:52,535 --> 00:56:54,245
Come with me to Mount Olympus.

587
00:56:54,412 --> 00:56:58,124
Drink nectar with the gods.
Sing the ancient songs of pleasure.

588
00:56:58,291 --> 00:57:01,378
And put Athena and Diana to shame.

589
00:57:04,422 --> 00:57:08,093
Oh, you aren't half of one
with the words, aren't you?

590
00:57:08,426 --> 00:57:10,804
And don't be frightened
of me, will you, lvy?

591
00:57:10,971 --> 00:57:15,976
When a botanist finds a rare flower,
he shouts his triumph, doesn't he?

592
00:57:17,102 --> 00:57:19,187
Are you one of them?

593
00:57:19,354 --> 00:57:23,608
You like a man who sees a girl
and makes up his mind, don't you?

594
00:57:25,402 --> 00:57:28,405
I don't know what you're talking about.

595
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:32,659
Oh, she doesn't know
what I'm talking about.

596
00:57:36,705 --> 00:57:39,374
-Please, sir.
-But you'll find out, won't you?

597
00:57:39,541 --> 00:57:42,627
-Please.
-You'll find out what it means.

598
00:57:42,877 --> 00:57:43,878
Please, sir.

599
00:57:49,801 --> 00:57:51,386
The London Post, Sir Charles.

600
00:57:51,553 --> 00:57:53,096
Oh, thank you.

601
00:57:53,305 --> 00:57:55,640
And one for you, mademoiselle.

602
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:17,746
What does Harry have to say
this morning, my dear?

603
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:21,124
I said, what does Harry say this morning?

604
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:23,501
Oh, nothing much.

605
00:58:23,668 --> 00:58:26,421
I'll wager my gout hurts him
more than it does me.

606
00:58:28,381 --> 00:58:30,091
Does he send any news I can hear?

607
00:58:30,258 --> 00:58:34,763
Oh, he just says that he walked
through the East End recently.

608
00:58:36,973 --> 00:58:40,393
" I have never seen such deplorable
housing conditions.

609
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:43,813
Surely the city fathers
should find the funds to...."

610
00:58:44,648 --> 00:58:48,526
Well, then he just goes on to say
about the housing conditions.

611
00:58:48,693 --> 00:58:50,487
They must be pretty dreadful.

612
00:58:50,737 --> 00:58:55,492
Yes, he's quite right. They're disgraceful.
I was just saying at the club before I left.

613
00:58:55,659 --> 00:58:58,870
Now, there's a problem
Harry could get his teeth into.

614
00:58:59,037 --> 00:59:00,872
He's just the man to....

615
00:59:01,164 --> 00:59:03,458
Here, here, my dear. What's wrong?

616
00:59:03,625 --> 00:59:06,378
Nothing.
I suppose I'm just not very interested...

617
00:59:06,544 --> 00:59:10,048
...in housing conditions at the moment.

618
00:59:10,840 --> 00:59:14,928
You mean because a man doesn't cover
the pages with sentiment? Nonsense.

619
00:59:15,095 --> 00:59:18,390
A woman must learn to read
between the lines, my dear.

620
00:59:18,556 --> 00:59:21,226
Yes, I like the tone of that letter.

621
00:59:21,643 --> 00:59:26,314
And what's more, my dear, I think my gout
is getting very, very much better.

622
00:59:57,595 --> 01:00:00,640
-Oh, hello, Marcia.
-Are you here alone?

623
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:04,269
Yes, yes. I just made some tea.
Come and have a cup.

624
01:00:04,477 --> 01:00:08,732
Not me, nor you either. We ain't got time.
Get dressed, we're going out.

625
01:00:08,898 --> 01:00:13,445
Freddie's got a young brother from Oxford.
They want another girl to make it a quartet.

626
01:00:15,071 --> 01:00:17,282
He's a bit of all right too.

627
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:19,284
And we're going to the Empire.

628
01:00:19,451 --> 01:00:22,370
-The Empire?
-Yes. Oh, it's ever so gay there, lvy...

629
01:00:22,537 --> 01:00:26,291
...and the show is grand.
It's just where all the toffs go.

630
01:00:29,419 --> 01:00:33,214
-No, I don't think so, Marcia.
-Why not?

631
01:00:33,381 --> 01:00:36,009
I just don't feel like it. That's all.

632
01:00:36,176 --> 01:00:38,553
You ain't afraid to go, are you?

633
01:00:38,970 --> 01:00:40,597
Afraid?

634
01:00:42,349 --> 01:00:45,560
-Why should I be afraid?
-Oh, I don't know.

635
01:00:45,727 --> 01:00:47,270
I just thought....

636
01:00:47,437 --> 01:00:49,147
Well, I ain't afraid of nobody.

637
01:00:49,314 --> 01:00:52,067
But you ain't been out
for ever so long, have you?

638
01:00:52,233 --> 01:00:55,528
-No, but--
-He ain't your lord and master, is he?

639
01:00:55,695 --> 01:00:56,863
I should say he ain't.

640
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:59,991
Or is it because you ain't
got a nice enough dress?

641
01:01:03,662 --> 01:01:04,829
Of course I have.

642
01:01:04,996 --> 01:01:07,958
What are you standing there for, then?
Go and put it on.

643
01:01:10,627 --> 01:01:12,253
All right.

644
01:01:15,757 --> 01:01:18,468
What's that across your back?

645
01:01:20,178 --> 01:01:21,930
What? There's nothing.

646
01:01:25,016 --> 01:01:27,227
Did he do that to you?

647
01:01:27,394 --> 01:01:29,688
-Let me see.
-No. No.

648
01:01:30,689 --> 01:01:32,691
It ain't nothing.

649
01:01:33,233 --> 01:01:35,527
-I just--
-So that's your fine friend, is it?

650
01:01:35,694 --> 01:01:37,237
The dirty, filthy brute!

651
01:01:37,404 --> 01:01:40,198
If ever a man dared lay a hand
to me like that, l'd--

652
01:01:44,077 --> 01:01:45,870
Well....

653
01:01:46,454 --> 01:01:50,125
Aren't you going to introduce
me to our charming visitor?

654
01:01:53,253 --> 01:01:55,130
It's Marcia.

655
01:01:56,381 --> 01:01:59,050
This is my friend, Mr. Hyde.

656
01:01:59,342 --> 01:02:01,678
You've heard me speak
about him, haven't you?

657
01:02:01,845 --> 01:02:06,308
Oh, yes, Marcia.
I've heard a great deal about you.

658
01:02:06,474 --> 01:02:08,768
I've never been interested.

659
01:02:08,935 --> 01:02:10,145
Until now.

660
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,564
I've got to be toddling along now.

661
01:02:17,193 --> 01:02:19,571
-T oodle-loo, lvy.
-Oh, no, no.

662
01:02:19,738 --> 01:02:21,531
Don't go now, Marcia.

663
01:02:21,698 --> 01:02:26,828
After all, this could be very interesting,
the three of us in friendly discussion.

664
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,955
I can't keep my friend waiting.

665
01:02:29,122 --> 01:02:32,542
-I'll be dropping by, lvy.
-Yes, yes, yes.

666
01:02:33,752 --> 01:02:36,796
Drop by sometime when I'm here, Marcia.

667
01:02:37,297 --> 01:02:39,215
Your ideas differ from mine.

668
01:02:40,133 --> 01:02:44,346
It would be a charming
experience to change them.

669
01:02:44,596 --> 01:02:46,848
Ivy found it that way.
Didn't we, dear?

670
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,771
Nice material.

671
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:54,689
Goodbye.

672
01:03:13,291 --> 01:03:15,919
Very nice material.

673
01:03:26,346 --> 01:03:28,807
Marcia's a very pretty girl, isn't she?

674
01:03:29,599 --> 01:03:31,476
Oui. Yes, sir.

675
01:03:34,271 --> 01:03:36,773
That's what frightens you, isn't it?

676
01:03:37,524 --> 01:03:38,817
Why...

677
01:03:38,984 --> 01:03:40,860
...no, sir, l....

678
01:03:42,279 --> 01:03:45,156
You're afraid I'll become
interested in Marcia.

679
01:03:45,323 --> 01:03:46,741
Why...

680
01:03:46,908 --> 01:03:49,327
...well, if you--
If you want to--

681
01:03:49,494 --> 01:03:50,870
What?!

682
01:03:51,037 --> 01:03:52,497
What?!

683
01:03:53,790 --> 01:03:56,209
You're not very clear.

684
01:03:58,211 --> 01:04:00,130
Well, sir, l....

685
01:04:00,839 --> 01:04:04,301
Oh. Oh, you poor child.

686
01:04:04,467 --> 01:04:08,597
I'm such a tease, aren't l?
Such a tease.

687
01:04:10,807 --> 01:04:12,434
Yes, sir.

688
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:19,482
What a lucky man I am
to be loved this way.

689
01:04:24,237 --> 01:04:27,782
But supposing I did have
to leave you for a while?

690
01:04:29,284 --> 01:04:31,536
Leave, sir? When?

691
01:04:31,703 --> 01:04:34,914
I'm not saying when,
I said " suppose. "

692
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:38,209
Well....

693
01:04:39,294 --> 01:04:43,340
Supposing I had to take a trip
from time to time?

694
01:04:43,548 --> 01:04:45,008
You....

695
01:04:45,216 --> 01:04:47,552
You mean...soon?

696
01:04:48,053 --> 01:04:50,138
Well, now, I don't know.

697
01:04:52,515 --> 01:04:54,225
Oh, you mustn't look so worried.

698
01:04:57,270 --> 01:05:00,106
It won't be for a long, long time.

699
01:05:02,859 --> 01:05:04,611
Oh, I see.

700
01:05:04,945 --> 01:05:07,530
So we won't think
about it now, will we?

701
01:05:07,739 --> 01:05:08,907
No, sir.

702
01:05:09,407 --> 01:05:12,577
When I do go, it will break
your heart, won't it?

703
01:05:13,244 --> 01:05:14,412
Yes, sir.

704
01:05:26,257 --> 01:05:27,592
Well....

705
01:05:28,468 --> 01:05:31,763
What would my little cherub
like to do this evening?

706
01:05:32,055 --> 01:05:34,474
Oh, sir, could we go out?

707
01:05:34,641 --> 01:05:38,603
Out? You mean gad about a bit,
see the sights?

708
01:05:38,770 --> 01:05:41,439
Yes, sir. Oh, you'd like it,
wouldn't you, sir?

709
01:05:41,606 --> 01:05:45,402
Well, now, I don't know. I don't know.
That might be very charming.

710
01:05:45,568 --> 01:05:46,903
Where would we go?

711
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:49,447
Oh, they say that the Empire
and such places--

712
01:05:49,614 --> 01:05:51,449
They do? Who does?

713
01:05:51,616 --> 01:05:54,035
Well, Marcia, sir.
She says it's ever so gay.

714
01:05:54,202 --> 01:05:56,621
-Oh, really?
-Yes.

715
01:05:57,205 --> 01:05:58,957
We can go, can't we?

716
01:05:59,124 --> 01:06:02,085
They say that the bill
is ever so good.

717
01:06:04,629 --> 01:06:07,841
And I haven't been out for so long.

718
01:06:08,008 --> 01:06:11,219
No. No, that's right.
You haven't, have you?

719
01:06:11,386 --> 01:06:13,930
You do look a little pale.

720
01:06:14,139 --> 01:06:17,767
Yes. Yes, that's true.
Not that I am complaining, you understand--

721
01:06:17,934 --> 01:06:20,604
Oh, no. Oh, no, no. I understand.

722
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:22,981
You're just nervous and jumpy, that's all.

723
01:06:23,148 --> 01:06:24,941
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, yes.

724
01:06:25,108 --> 01:06:27,944
You have that cooped-up feeling.

725
01:06:28,695 --> 01:06:30,488
Yes. You do understand, don't you?

726
01:06:30,655 --> 01:06:31,865
-Yes, yes.
-Well, then--

727
01:06:32,032 --> 01:06:34,993
Well, now, where would we go?

728
01:06:37,537 --> 01:06:40,206
We might go to Albert Hall.

729
01:06:40,373 --> 01:06:44,252
Yes. And hear a symphony.

730
01:06:45,211 --> 01:06:47,339
Albert Hall, sir?

731
01:06:50,300 --> 01:06:53,803
Well, I sort of hoped that....

732
01:06:56,014 --> 01:06:57,182
What makes you say...?

733
01:06:58,725 --> 01:07:00,352
So you'd like to go out, huh?

734
01:07:04,564 --> 01:07:06,149
Yes, sir.

735
01:07:06,441 --> 01:07:08,109
I'll go and put my things on.

736
01:07:10,028 --> 01:07:11,696
Don't hurry.

737
01:07:12,155 --> 01:07:14,115
Because we're not going.

738
01:07:15,075 --> 01:07:16,660
Sir?

739
01:07:19,704 --> 01:07:22,791
The bill is ever so good right here.

740
01:07:42,727 --> 01:07:46,564
Now, let's see, what shall we do?

741
01:07:52,570 --> 01:07:55,156
We could play cards.

742
01:08:00,996 --> 01:08:04,874
But you're probably tired
of cards, aren't you?

743
01:08:11,798 --> 01:08:14,301
You might read to me.

744
01:08:15,051 --> 01:08:16,595
Yes.

745
01:08:18,847 --> 01:08:20,348
Yes.

746
01:08:21,474 --> 01:08:24,269
Milton's Paradise Lost would be nice.

747
01:08:30,108 --> 01:08:32,444
But we haven't the book, have we?

748
01:08:36,781 --> 01:08:42,162
And I don't suppose you know it
from memory, do you?

749
01:08:43,121 --> 01:08:44,998
I know.

750
01:08:45,624 --> 01:08:48,126
I know what we like.

751
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:01,431
You must sing for me.

752
01:09:04,517 --> 01:09:06,811
No. Oh, no, not that.

753
01:09:06,978 --> 01:09:08,146
-Why not?
-Not that.

754
01:09:08,313 --> 01:09:09,564
Not in good voice?

755
01:09:09,731 --> 01:09:12,651
-lt isn't that, sir, but--
-But it's such a pretty song.

756
01:09:12,817 --> 01:09:15,070
-Please, not tonight.
-Yes. Sing it gaily.

757
01:09:15,236 --> 01:09:18,490
-I can't! Truly, I can't!
-Sing it with deep compassion then.

758
01:09:18,657 --> 01:09:20,784
Or loving kindness even.

759
01:09:20,992 --> 01:09:23,662
-Sing it moodily, sing it with--
-I can't!

760
01:09:23,828 --> 01:09:26,915
You hear me? Sing it! Sing it!

761
01:09:42,013 --> 01:09:45,183
Smile when you sing! Be happy! Be gay!

762
01:09:51,064 --> 01:09:52,649
That's it!

763
01:09:53,984 --> 01:09:56,778
That's it! That's it! That's it!

764
01:09:58,822 --> 01:10:00,782
That's it!

765
01:10:03,368 --> 01:10:06,037
Bravo! A prima donna is born!

766
01:10:06,204 --> 01:10:08,707
Let's shower her with orchids!

767
01:10:11,876 --> 01:10:14,129
The world is yours, my darling.

768
01:10:14,296 --> 01:10:16,423
The moment is mine.

769
01:10:22,262 --> 01:10:24,222
And I says to the wife, I says:

770
01:10:24,389 --> 01:10:28,268
" Look here, my girl,
if you think the world is...."

771
01:10:55,086 --> 01:10:56,921
Good morning, sir.

772
01:10:57,547 --> 01:11:00,508
How about a nice hot cup of tea, sir?

773
01:11:00,675 --> 01:11:02,093
No. No, thanks, Poole.

774
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:05,555
Would you consider a telegram
from foreign parts, sir?

775
01:11:07,641 --> 01:11:10,352
And a nice cup of tea as well, sir, huh?

776
01:11:10,518 --> 01:11:11,686
I know it's good news.

777
01:11:11,853 --> 01:11:15,315
Hobson told me last night that they
were expected home today, sir.

778
01:11:15,482 --> 01:11:18,568
This is a great day for us,
if you'll forgive me saying so.

779
01:11:18,777 --> 01:11:22,739
Soon be back to our regular meals,
regular hours, regular ways, sir.

780
01:11:22,948 --> 01:11:25,450
-Your breakfast will be ready soon, sir.
-Poole.

781
01:11:27,786 --> 01:11:32,082
Put on your hat and coat and take an
envelope to the district messenger office...

782
01:11:32,248 --> 01:11:35,377
-...to be delivered by hand.
-Very good, sir.

783
01:12:23,883 --> 01:12:27,429
Ivy. Ivy, dear, it's me.

784
01:12:35,854 --> 01:12:38,690
-Oh, Marcia. Hello.
-Hello, lvy.

785
01:12:38,857 --> 01:12:40,775
I didn't hear you. Hello, Fred.

786
01:12:41,318 --> 01:12:43,028
Hello, lvy.

787
01:12:45,363 --> 01:12:47,782
Get yourself a drink, Fred.

788
01:12:48,533 --> 01:12:51,870
-I'll make some tea.
-We don't want anything.

789
01:12:52,537 --> 01:12:54,205
Yes, but....

790
01:13:01,880 --> 01:13:04,716
Don't bother about us, lvy, dear.

791
01:13:09,179 --> 01:13:11,806
-Oh, Marcia!
-Oh.

792
01:13:20,523 --> 01:13:22,692
For Miss lvy Peterson.

793
01:13:24,235 --> 01:13:26,029
Thanks, governor.

794
01:13:40,543 --> 01:13:41,920
Look.

795
01:13:47,092 --> 01:13:49,427
Fifty pounds.

796
01:13:50,679 --> 01:13:53,807
There ain't no letter.
You don't suppose it's from him?

797
01:13:53,974 --> 01:13:56,101
He must have sent it for what he's done.

798
01:13:56,268 --> 01:13:59,479
No, not him. He's too mean, he is.

799
01:14:03,566 --> 01:14:05,652
Oh, I don't know.

800
01:14:08,405 --> 01:14:11,074
I wouldn't put it past him.

801
01:14:15,954 --> 01:14:17,414
Yes.

802
01:14:18,581 --> 01:14:20,458
Yes, that's it.

803
01:14:22,294 --> 01:14:25,255
Hopes I'll use it to try and run away.

804
01:14:26,131 --> 01:14:29,634
Oh, I can see him thinking it up, I can.

805
01:14:30,969 --> 01:14:34,556
And then, then he'll follow me.

806
01:14:35,223 --> 01:14:38,977
And just when I think that
I've got free, he'll....

807
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:42,939
I can't stand it anymore.

808
01:14:43,106 --> 01:14:45,317
I can't stand it.

809
01:14:47,652 --> 01:14:50,155
Oh, if I could only do it...

810
01:14:51,156 --> 01:14:53,575
...I'd go down to the river.

811
01:14:56,661 --> 01:14:59,080
Oh, lvy.

812
01:15:00,373 --> 01:15:03,960
It's her nerves, that's what.
She ought to see a doctor.

813
01:15:06,004 --> 01:15:10,216
There's a copy of the Winged Victory.
The real one's in the Louvre in Paris.

814
01:15:10,383 --> 01:15:12,177
I know because I saw it there.

815
01:15:12,344 --> 01:15:15,430
What's the sense of being victorious
if you haven't a head?

816
01:15:15,597 --> 01:15:19,059
What's the sense of my taking a trip,
acquiring art and culture...

817
01:15:19,225 --> 01:15:21,436
...if you're not going to pay attention?

818
01:15:21,603 --> 01:15:25,065
You're back here.
That's the only victory that counts.

819
01:15:25,231 --> 01:15:27,734
That's why I was deluged
with all those letters.

820
01:15:27,901 --> 01:15:29,486
-Bea, now look--
-Oh, I know.

821
01:15:29,694 --> 01:15:34,032
But if I ever go away again and you
don't write just because you're ill....

822
01:15:34,491 --> 01:15:38,119
Oh, don't you see how much more
worried that would make me?

823
01:15:39,371 --> 01:15:40,830
It all amounts to this.

824
01:15:41,039 --> 01:15:45,752
But February is still a long way away,
and your father will simply have to listen....

825
01:15:47,003 --> 01:15:52,092
If you don't stop looking at me like that,
I won't be responsible for what happens.

826
01:15:54,261 --> 01:15:57,764
-Aren't public places awful sometimes?
-Awful.

827
01:15:57,931 --> 01:16:01,017
-May I interrupt this loud conversation?
-Oh, here you are.

828
01:16:01,184 --> 01:16:04,646
Sir Charles, glad to see you.
Sorry you weren't in. You look fine.

829
01:16:04,813 --> 01:16:07,524
It's nice to be back.
You're looking well yourself.

830
01:16:07,691 --> 01:16:10,610
Sorry to be late, my dear.
In an argument at the club.

831
01:16:10,777 --> 01:16:11,987
What's on the program?

832
01:16:12,153 --> 01:16:14,864
I thought we'd go to Stewart's,
if that's agreeable.

833
01:16:15,031 --> 01:16:18,410
Excellent! But, while it's
on my mind, Harry...

834
01:16:18,576 --> 01:16:20,829
...there's something we must
straighten out.

835
01:16:20,996 --> 01:16:23,540
I've gone through enough
with Beatrix over this.

836
01:16:23,915 --> 01:16:27,669
I may be getting old and crotchety,
but I won't put up with it anymore.

837
01:16:27,836 --> 01:16:31,172
I'm afraid you must take her
off my hands as soon as possible.

838
01:16:32,048 --> 01:16:33,800
Oh, Father!

839
01:16:33,967 --> 01:16:35,760
Well, Sir Charles, that's--

840
01:16:35,927 --> 01:16:38,221
Of course, I insist on all the trimmings:

841
01:16:38,388 --> 01:16:41,182
Wedding at St. Margaret's,
Bishop Manners, reception.

842
01:16:41,516 --> 01:16:43,727
Yes, sir, Sir Charles. I'd--

843
01:16:43,893 --> 01:16:47,772
Well, show her you're happy about it.
Do something, man.

844
01:16:52,277 --> 01:16:55,572
Just another work of art, madam.
It's not in your catalog.

845
01:17:03,455 --> 01:17:05,707
We're feeling rather gay, are we, sir?

846
01:17:05,874 --> 01:17:08,627
Poole, old friend, I'm going
to be married very soon.

847
01:17:08,793 --> 01:17:11,087
Sir, you don't know how
happy that makes me.

848
01:17:11,254 --> 01:17:13,340
I knew it would, Poole.

849
01:17:14,299 --> 01:17:15,592
Thank you.

850
01:17:15,926 --> 01:17:20,221
Sir, there's a patient in the
consulting room, a Miss lvy Peterson.

851
01:17:20,639 --> 01:17:23,642
She's without an appointment.
If you've no time, I can--

852
01:17:23,808 --> 01:17:26,394
No, no, that's all right. I'll see her.

853
01:18:21,366 --> 01:18:22,867
So it's you, sir.

854
01:18:23,201 --> 01:18:25,453
So you are the famous Dr. Jekyll.

855
01:18:27,163 --> 01:18:28,581
Well....

856
01:18:29,666 --> 01:18:34,379
I'm the one you and your friend
took home that night.

857
01:18:34,713 --> 01:18:36,840
-Remember?
-Well, what...

858
01:18:37,048 --> 01:18:39,676
...what brings you here, Miss Peterson?

859
01:18:39,843 --> 01:18:41,469
-I think....
-Are you ill?

860
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:52,856
There.

861
01:18:53,773 --> 01:18:55,358
That's what.

862
01:18:56,735 --> 01:18:58,486
Look at that.

863
01:19:00,238 --> 01:19:01,990
Pretty, ain't it?

864
01:19:03,074 --> 01:19:05,744
Did you ever see a thing
like that before?

865
01:19:06,703 --> 01:19:08,580
I'll get you some lotion.

866
01:19:08,747 --> 01:19:10,373
Lotion?

867
01:19:11,249 --> 01:19:14,210
It won't be lotion that will
do the trick, sir.

868
01:19:14,753 --> 01:19:17,172
It's more than that. I need help.

869
01:19:17,464 --> 01:19:19,883
I can't stand it anymore.

870
01:19:22,427 --> 01:19:24,387
It's Hyde, sir.

871
01:19:24,596 --> 01:19:26,056
It's a man I know, Mr. Hyde.

872
01:19:26,264 --> 01:19:29,935
It's him that's done it and more.
More I can't tell you.

873
01:19:30,936 --> 01:19:33,021
He ain't a human. He's a beast.

874
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:37,359
And he won't let me go, sir,
and I am afraid to run away.

875
01:19:41,571 --> 01:19:45,909
Marcia, she's my girlfriend,
and Freddie, that's her friend, they...

876
01:19:46,076 --> 01:19:49,496
...they say it's my nerves,
and that you know about such things.

877
01:19:49,704 --> 01:19:51,539
And that you could help me.

878
01:19:52,749 --> 01:19:55,585
Oh, I can't bear up under it no more!

879
01:20:03,802 --> 01:20:05,929
If you can't help me...

880
01:20:06,513 --> 01:20:09,057
...give me some poison
so I can kill myself.

881
01:20:11,309 --> 01:20:15,063
Why didn't you try to get help before?
Why didn't you go to the police?

882
01:20:15,230 --> 01:20:16,606
I tell you, I'm afraid.

883
01:20:16,773 --> 01:20:18,191
No...

884
01:20:18,984 --> 01:20:21,611
...he ain't a man.
He's a devil, he is.

885
01:20:23,321 --> 01:20:25,240
He knows what you're thinking about.

886
01:20:25,407 --> 01:20:27,909
If he knows I'm here,
who knows what he'll do.

887
01:20:28,076 --> 01:20:30,787
It won't be nothing human,
I can tell you!

888
01:20:33,915 --> 01:20:38,336
Oh, please. Please help me keep him off.

889
01:20:41,881 --> 01:20:43,592
I'll do anything you ask, sir.

890
01:20:48,388 --> 01:20:51,308
I ain't as bad as you might think.

891
01:20:53,518 --> 01:20:54,936
Well....

892
01:20:55,854 --> 01:20:57,856
Men say that l....

893
01:20:58,565 --> 01:21:01,860
I ain't a bad looker
when I'm more myself.

894
01:21:04,946 --> 01:21:07,824
You liked me once a little, didn't you?

895
01:21:09,659 --> 01:21:11,036
Really, you....

896
01:21:11,202 --> 01:21:14,372
You're such a fine and kind gentleman.

897
01:21:15,165 --> 01:21:18,668
Honest, that night,
when you walked out of my place...

898
01:21:20,211 --> 01:21:22,714
...I made as if I didn't care.

899
01:21:23,757 --> 01:21:25,550
I did care.

900
01:21:26,676 --> 01:21:30,722
After you'd gone,
I kept wishing you'd come back.

901
01:21:30,889 --> 01:21:32,349
Truly, I did.

902
01:21:44,402 --> 01:21:47,489
This man, Hyde, will never
trouble you again.

903
01:21:48,615 --> 01:21:50,700
I give you my word.

904
01:21:50,909 --> 01:21:52,035
How do you know?

905
01:21:52,243 --> 01:21:54,621
He'll come back!
He'll come back and kill me!

906
01:21:54,788 --> 01:21:58,375
No. He won't come back.

907
01:21:58,917 --> 01:22:00,752
I'll see to it.

908
01:22:02,003 --> 01:22:04,422
Oh, you don't know him, sir.

909
01:22:04,673 --> 01:22:07,592
Oh, you don't know him.
He ain't human, he ain't!

910
01:22:07,759 --> 01:22:10,095
I gave you my word.

911
01:22:11,263 --> 01:22:13,890
You'll never see Hyde again.

912
01:22:15,392 --> 01:22:16,559
You must believe me.

913
01:22:22,816 --> 01:22:24,985
I believe you, sir.

914
01:22:26,069 --> 01:22:28,113
I believe you.

915
01:22:29,531 --> 01:22:31,491
You must go now.

916
01:22:32,534 --> 01:22:34,077
Yes, sir.

917
01:22:35,829 --> 01:22:37,455
Yes, sir.

918
01:22:59,603 --> 01:23:02,480
For a moment, I thought....

919
01:23:08,737 --> 01:23:10,322
Goodbye.

920
01:23:19,998 --> 01:23:22,667
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have
admitted such a person.

921
01:23:22,834 --> 01:23:24,586
I didn't know she was hysterical.

922
01:23:24,753 --> 01:23:27,047
That's all right.
I'm glad you admitted her.

923
01:23:27,213 --> 01:23:30,008
Now, about the wedding,
we've got a lot to discuss.

924
01:23:30,175 --> 01:23:33,053
-We've never been married before.
-Let's not get upset.

925
01:23:33,219 --> 01:23:34,596
We'll manage it somehow.

926
01:23:36,348 --> 01:23:39,184
-Good evening, Mr. Weller.
-Good evening, Dr. Jekyll.

927
01:23:39,351 --> 01:23:41,770
A touch of autumn in the air.
Very seasonable.

928
01:23:41,937 --> 01:23:44,481
-Wonderful, Mr. Weller, wonderful.
-Listen here.

929
01:23:44,648 --> 01:23:46,900
Remember that comet
I was telling you about?

930
01:23:47,067 --> 01:23:49,486
The blooming thing
didn't hit us after all.

931
01:23:49,653 --> 01:23:50,987
-You know why?
-No. Why?

932
01:23:51,154 --> 01:23:53,740
Because it knew at this moment,
across the park...

933
01:23:53,907 --> 01:23:57,327
...Sir Emery is going to announce
the marriage of his daughter...

934
01:23:57,494 --> 01:24:00,288
-...to the very man you're talking to.
-Dr. Jekyll!

935
01:24:00,455 --> 01:24:03,208
And my best wishes to
the Mrs. Jekyll as is to be.

936
01:24:03,375 --> 01:24:05,335
Thank you. You don't mind if I hurry?

937
01:24:05,502 --> 01:24:08,380
-Godspeed, Dr. Jekyll.
-Thank you, Mr. Weller!

938
01:26:39,531 --> 01:26:40,949
Oh.

939
01:26:59,801 --> 01:27:03,388
Here's hoping that Hyde rots...

940
01:27:03,555 --> 01:27:05,724
...wherever he is.

941
01:27:07,392 --> 01:27:11,229
Burn slow when the time comes.

942
01:27:18,486 --> 01:27:23,742
Here's hoping that Dr. Jekyll
thinks of his lvy...

943
01:27:25,327 --> 01:27:27,996
...as I know he'd like to.

944
01:27:30,206 --> 01:27:33,084
As his lvy thinks of him.

945
01:27:35,295 --> 01:27:37,672
Because he's an angel.

946
01:27:38,757 --> 01:27:41,509
Here's to my angel.

947
01:28:12,123 --> 01:28:14,042
Surprised?

948
01:28:14,459 --> 01:28:17,462
Couldn't be that you
didn't expect to see me?

949
01:28:18,755 --> 01:28:20,215
No.

950
01:28:21,466 --> 01:28:23,134
I've been....

951
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:24,719
I've been waiting for you.

952
01:28:25,262 --> 01:28:28,723
But you've been celebrating.
Is there some new event, some change?

953
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:31,977
No.

954
01:28:33,853 --> 01:28:35,105
No. I just thought--

955
01:28:35,272 --> 01:28:37,941
You've just been drinking
to calm your nerves, huh?

956
01:28:38,108 --> 01:28:42,362
It is your nerves, isn't it?
Perhaps you should see a doctor.

957
01:28:45,323 --> 01:28:46,825
No.

958
01:28:48,201 --> 01:28:51,121
No, I don't need a doctor.

959
01:28:53,415 --> 01:28:55,959
Would you like to have some wine, sir?

960
01:28:57,002 --> 01:28:59,337
I'll get you another glass.

961
01:29:03,883 --> 01:29:07,470
Dr. Jekyll's a good man.
Yes, Dr. Henry Jekyll.

962
01:29:07,679 --> 01:29:10,599
-ls he?
-Yes. Yes.

963
01:29:10,765 --> 01:29:15,020
And a fine gentleman too.
Different than any man you might know.

964
01:29:15,186 --> 01:29:17,522
Yes. Yes.

965
01:29:17,689 --> 01:29:22,902
"A nice, fine gentleman like yourself, sir,
wouldn't be knowing such a person. " No.

966
01:29:23,069 --> 01:29:27,907
" I ain't such a bad looker, sir,
when I'm more myself. " Yes.

967
01:29:28,074 --> 01:29:31,494
He's the kind of man you can
get down on your knees to, isn't he?

968
01:29:31,661 --> 01:29:35,624
A sweet, dear, pure man
that you can trust and believe.

969
01:29:35,790 --> 01:29:38,501
He's a smug, hypocritical coward,
that's what he is!

970
01:29:38,668 --> 01:29:41,087
-You couldn't know him!
-I know him intimately.

971
01:29:41,254 --> 01:29:42,923
And I detest him intimately...

972
01:29:43,089 --> 01:29:46,134
...from his lofty brain to
the soles of his virtuous feet!

973
01:29:46,301 --> 01:29:50,221
And you, you....
" I'll do anything you ask, sir. "

974
01:29:50,388 --> 01:29:53,516
Well, you saw him, didn't you?
You saw the respectable fool.

975
01:29:53,683 --> 01:29:56,895
Clutched his halo and held
it straight, didn't he!

976
01:29:57,562 --> 01:29:58,980
How do you know all that?

977
01:29:59,147 --> 01:30:01,066
I know everything you do and think.

978
01:30:01,232 --> 01:30:03,944
Dr. Jekyll wouldn't tell you.
He ain't the kind of--

979
01:30:04,110 --> 01:30:07,906
And as you were leaving the room,
you turned at the door, didn't you?

980
01:30:08,073 --> 01:30:11,660
And you said,
" For a moment, I thought...."

981
01:30:11,826 --> 01:30:15,080
What did you think?
What did you think?

982
01:30:15,246 --> 01:30:18,083
Did you think Dr. Jekyll
was falling in love with you?

983
01:30:18,625 --> 01:30:21,586
You, with your cheap little dreams?

984
01:30:24,422 --> 01:30:26,925
Or did you think, perhaps...

985
01:30:27,092 --> 01:30:30,762
...that in him, you saw
a bit of me, Hyde?

986
01:30:34,766 --> 01:30:38,687
Oh, but it confuses you, doesn't it?

987
01:30:38,853 --> 01:30:42,023
It isn't quite clear, is it?

988
01:30:43,441 --> 01:30:45,151
Oh....

989
01:30:45,819 --> 01:30:47,362
What are you going to do?

990
01:30:47,612 --> 01:30:50,615
Something so simple.

991
01:30:51,032 --> 01:30:55,453
I'm going to put an end
to all that confusion.

992
01:31:06,548 --> 01:31:10,051
Please, sir!
Oh, no!

993
01:31:10,218 --> 01:31:12,637
Please, no!

994
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:17,100
Yes, dance.

995
01:31:17,267 --> 01:31:19,269
Dance and dream.

996
01:31:19,436 --> 01:31:22,856
Dream that you're Mrs. Henry Jekyll
of Harley Street...

997
01:31:23,023 --> 01:31:26,484
...dancing with your own butler
and six footmen.

998
01:31:26,651 --> 01:31:32,490
Dream they've all turned into white mice
and crawled into an eternal pumpkin.

999
01:31:37,829 --> 01:31:40,915
Here, you in there!
Open this here door!

1000
01:31:47,547 --> 01:31:49,007
Police!

1001
01:31:52,177 --> 01:31:54,679
-lvy!
-I'm going in.

1002
01:31:54,846 --> 01:31:56,514
Governor!

1003
01:31:58,016 --> 01:31:59,601
Ho, there!

1004
01:32:08,234 --> 01:32:09,444
Hey, you there!

1005
01:32:09,611 --> 01:32:10,779
Look here, governor.

1006
01:32:10,946 --> 01:32:13,990
-Steady! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Police!

1007
01:32:14,574 --> 01:32:16,534
Chase him, somebody!
Get a copper!

1008
01:32:16,701 --> 01:32:19,955
Police! Hurry.

1009
01:33:03,248 --> 01:33:06,251
Come on, open up!
Let me in. I'm a friend of Dr. Jekyll's.

1010
01:33:06,418 --> 01:33:08,837
-Dr. Jekyll's not home.
-He told me to wait.

1011
01:33:09,004 --> 01:33:11,423
-I know all Dr. Jekyll's friends.
-Let me in!

1012
01:33:11,590 --> 01:33:14,884
-You'll have to come back.
-Let me in, or I'll bash this door--

1013
01:33:15,051 --> 01:33:18,013
If you don't go away,
I'll have to send for the police!

1014
01:34:11,274 --> 01:34:13,401
That's him!
There he goes!

1015
01:34:13,568 --> 01:34:16,613
-This ain't no place to rob.
-But robbed it is!

1016
01:34:16,780 --> 01:34:18,949
Help!
Police!

1017
01:34:24,871 --> 01:34:26,665
-Good night, Charles.
-Good night.

1018
01:34:26,831 --> 01:34:31,044
-Sorry your young man was detained, dear.
-So am l, Uncle Geoffrey.

1019
01:34:54,359 --> 01:34:55,694
Good evening, sir.

1020
01:34:55,860 --> 01:34:58,280
There was a ring at the door
a while ago, sir.

1021
01:34:58,446 --> 01:35:02,492
When I answered it,
there was nobody there. I found this.

1022
01:35:31,229 --> 01:35:34,149
You don't happen to know
what Dr. Jekyll uses these for?

1023
01:35:34,316 --> 01:35:38,862
No, sir, I don't rightly know.
I don't rightly know, sir.

1024
01:35:44,326 --> 01:35:47,370
-Have you got it?
-What are you doing hiding behind that--?

1025
01:35:47,537 --> 01:35:50,832
I was waiting for you, Dr. Lanyon.
I'm the man from Dr. Jekyll.

1026
01:35:50,999 --> 01:35:53,126
-The package, I'll take it.
-Step inside.

1027
01:35:53,293 --> 01:35:54,961
No, no!
There's not time.

1028
01:35:55,128 --> 01:35:58,506
As Jekyll's friend, I have the right
to ask you a few questions.

1029
01:35:58,673 --> 01:36:01,343
Come now, don't waste time
with prying questions.

1030
01:36:01,509 --> 01:36:03,929
-Let me have it--
-I don't like your attitude.

1031
01:36:04,095 --> 01:36:08,266
-Suppose you introduce yourself.
-Hyde. What difference does that make?

1032
01:36:12,604 --> 01:36:14,731
-You an acquaintance of Jekyll?
-Yes.

1033
01:36:14,940 --> 01:36:17,901
Yes, of course. I'm an old friend.
Now let me have the--

1034
01:36:18,068 --> 01:36:19,611
Where is Dr. Jekyll?

1035
01:36:19,778 --> 01:36:22,739
-Don't worry, he's alive.
-What's the matter? Is he ill?

1036
01:36:22,906 --> 01:36:25,742
-No! He's perfectly all right.
-Very well, then.

1037
01:36:25,909 --> 01:36:29,120
-I'll come with you and see for myself.
-You pretentious fool!

1038
01:36:29,287 --> 01:36:33,375
-You take another step with that, I'll shoot.
-Now, wait a minute, Lanyon.

1039
01:36:33,541 --> 01:36:36,962
I can't let you come with me,
and I can't tell you any more.

1040
01:36:37,128 --> 01:36:40,715
-Why not?
-Because. Because.

1041
01:36:41,466 --> 01:36:43,718
I warn you,
don't stick your nose into this.

1042
01:36:43,885 --> 01:36:46,388
You'd better let me go, Lanyon.

1043
01:36:46,554 --> 01:36:51,101
-You can ask Jekyll about it tomorrow.
-You'll take me to Harry Jekyll this minute.

1044
01:36:52,310 --> 01:36:55,272
For the last time, Lanyon,
would you let me leave alone?

1045
01:36:55,438 --> 01:36:59,234
-No.
-All right. All right, then.

1046
01:37:00,068 --> 01:37:02,696
Let it be on your own head.

1047
01:37:47,991 --> 01:37:50,285
Now, once again, Lanyon...

1048
01:37:50,619 --> 01:37:52,829
...will you let me take this glass
and go?

1049
01:37:53,580 --> 01:37:55,832
No, why should l?

1050
01:37:55,999 --> 01:37:57,375
For your own sake, Lanyon.

1051
01:37:57,542 --> 01:37:59,878
Whatever you're going to do,
get on with it!

1052
01:39:17,414 --> 01:39:19,791
I warned you, John.

1053
01:39:20,375 --> 01:39:22,502
Even as Hyde, I warned you.

1054
01:39:32,971 --> 01:39:35,140
You see what you've done,
don't you?

1055
01:39:35,473 --> 01:39:38,560
I mean, you,
you've gone beyond.

1056
01:39:38,727 --> 01:39:40,562
You've tampered with....

1057
01:39:41,146 --> 01:39:44,190
You've committed
the supreme blasphemy.

1058
01:39:44,983 --> 01:39:47,819
I know, John.
I know, I know.

1059
01:39:47,986 --> 01:39:50,488
-You must destroy the formula.
-I've done that.

1060
01:39:50,655 --> 01:39:54,492
No, I mean, you must destroy it from
your mind! You can't take this again!

1061
01:39:54,659 --> 01:39:57,454
I know. I know.
I know.

1062
01:39:58,538 --> 01:40:00,040
T onight....

1063
01:40:00,206 --> 01:40:03,043
T onight, on my way to Sir Charles'...

1064
01:40:03,335 --> 01:40:05,712
You see, I thought I could control....

1065
01:40:05,879 --> 01:40:09,758
But tonight this change, this thing you saw,
happened without my....

1066
01:40:11,301 --> 01:40:14,179
-What about Bea?
-I'll tell her.

1067
01:40:16,139 --> 01:40:18,892
At least I have strength
enough left for that.

1068
01:41:16,032 --> 01:41:17,534
Darling.

1069
01:41:18,410 --> 01:41:22,080
I heard you playing...

1070
01:41:22,247 --> 01:41:24,583
...and I thought we could talk in here...

1071
01:41:24,749 --> 01:41:27,377
...just as well as anywhere.

1072
01:41:27,544 --> 01:41:29,629
Well, of course, dear.

1073
01:41:29,796 --> 01:41:32,716
I can't imagine how you felt last night
when l--

1074
01:41:32,882 --> 01:41:35,051
You don't have to explain anything.

1075
01:41:35,260 --> 01:41:37,220
I know it must have been important.

1076
01:41:37,429 --> 01:41:41,933
-You know that I'd forgive anything you--
-But that's it, you mustn't forgive anymore!

1077
01:41:42,100 --> 01:41:44,311
You must make up your mind to....

1078
01:41:47,647 --> 01:41:51,234
T ell me, darling, what's wrong?

1079
01:41:53,111 --> 01:41:55,113
What is it, Harry?

1080
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,115
Look at me.

1081
01:41:58,950 --> 01:42:00,702
Please, Bea....

1082
01:42:01,286 --> 01:42:03,163
Let me begin....

1083
01:42:05,665 --> 01:42:08,543
There's no way to begin
except to tell you.

1084
01:42:08,919 --> 01:42:10,754
T ell me what?

1085
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:14,507
You're....

1086
01:42:14,674 --> 01:42:17,052
You're a brave girl, aren't you?

1087
01:42:17,969 --> 01:42:19,179
Yes.

1088
01:42:19,346 --> 01:42:23,558
That's why I can tell you like this,
because you are brave and strong.

1089
01:42:23,725 --> 01:42:25,685
Always remember that.

1090
01:42:28,355 --> 01:42:32,567
Bea, we can't be married.
I must never see you again.

1091
01:42:32,901 --> 01:42:34,486
Oh, you....

1092
01:42:35,278 --> 01:42:36,947
You don't know what you....

1093
01:42:37,155 --> 01:42:39,532
Harry, what's happened?
Look at me!

1094
01:42:39,699 --> 01:42:42,494
Just that. Just that.
That's all I can tell you.

1095
01:42:42,661 --> 01:42:44,287
But, why?

1096
01:42:44,496 --> 01:42:45,956
What...?

1097
01:42:46,164 --> 01:42:49,459
We've always said that there's nothing
we couldn't discuss.

1098
01:42:49,626 --> 01:42:53,672
-Nothing secret between you and me, ever.
-Don't ask any more, please.

1099
01:42:53,838 --> 01:42:56,466
If you ever trusted me, trust me now.

1100
01:42:56,675 --> 01:43:01,054
It's for your happiness and mine,
believe me. That's all I can say.

1101
01:43:01,221 --> 01:43:03,765
Oh, my darling!

1102
01:43:07,394 --> 01:43:09,104
Are you ill?

1103
01:43:09,271 --> 01:43:12,107
-There's something you--
-No, no.

1104
01:43:12,274 --> 01:43:16,111
Bea, don't ask me any more.
Don't try to understand. Just take my word.

1105
01:43:16,278 --> 01:43:18,071
Now, please go.

1106
01:43:20,657 --> 01:43:23,201
This is so wrong of me.

1107
01:43:24,619 --> 01:43:27,455
T o make you go through all of this.

1108
01:43:29,791 --> 01:43:32,794
You're trying not to hurt me,
aren't you?

1109
01:43:33,211 --> 01:43:34,462
Harry....

1110
01:43:34,629 --> 01:43:37,424
Harry, it's all right...

1111
01:43:37,591 --> 01:43:40,218
...if you don't love me anymore.

1112
01:43:41,595 --> 01:43:45,181
-I know things like that can happen.
-Bea.

1113
01:43:47,851 --> 01:43:49,728
Oh, you do.

1114
01:43:49,978 --> 01:43:51,688
You still do.

1115
01:43:52,772 --> 01:43:55,984
-What is it, dearest?
-Bea, Bea, darling.

1116
01:43:56,151 --> 01:43:57,736
No.

1117
01:43:58,486 --> 01:44:00,822
Don't say anything more.

1118
01:44:01,281 --> 01:44:03,825
Just hold me close.

1119
01:44:09,539 --> 01:44:11,625
Goodbye, darling.

1120
01:44:13,793 --> 01:44:15,253
Harry!

1121
01:44:16,171 --> 01:44:18,006
Harry, please!

1122
01:44:18,173 --> 01:44:21,551
Please come back!
Please don't....

1123
01:44:22,010 --> 01:44:23,511
Harry!

1124
01:45:20,944 --> 01:45:23,613
You did come back.

1125
01:45:24,614 --> 01:45:27,033
Oh, my darling.

1126
01:45:37,794 --> 01:45:39,296
Father!

1127
01:45:39,504 --> 01:45:41,131
Father!

1128
01:45:45,385 --> 01:45:48,305
Beatrix!
Beatrix!

1129
01:45:48,513 --> 01:45:49,806
Help!
Help!

1130
01:46:05,238 --> 01:46:07,657
What's the matter, sir?
What's wrong, sir?

1131
01:46:07,824 --> 01:46:11,161
-Help!
-Look! There he goes! There he goes! Look!

1132
01:46:11,328 --> 01:46:13,413
There he goes!

1133
01:46:15,790 --> 01:46:18,209
Hey, stop there!

1134
01:46:31,056 --> 01:46:32,515
Hey!

1135
01:46:35,185 --> 01:46:37,562
Hey! What's going on?!

1136
01:46:56,873 --> 01:46:58,541
Hold it, you!

1137
01:47:24,401 --> 01:47:26,444
This is the weapon, doctor.

1138
01:47:32,617 --> 01:47:34,661
Yes. I....

1139
01:47:35,662 --> 01:47:39,457
If you'll come with me, inspector.
Ward, you remain here.

1140
01:48:27,172 --> 01:48:30,300
Dr. Jekyll, that frightful maniac
broke into the house.

1141
01:48:30,508 --> 01:48:32,010
-Did he attack you, sir?
-Yes.

1142
01:48:32,177 --> 01:48:35,472
-Which way did he go? Out here?
-Didn't know you were home, sir.

1143
01:48:35,639 --> 01:48:38,683
-Are you badly hurt?
-No. No, I'll be all right.

1144
01:48:38,850 --> 01:48:40,977
This here door's locked.

1145
01:48:42,062 --> 01:48:44,898
-We'd better go out that way.
-Yes.

1146
01:48:46,775 --> 01:48:48,276
Wait!

1147
01:48:56,701 --> 01:49:00,038
-There. Heaven help him.
-Dr. Lanyon...

1148
01:49:00,205 --> 01:49:02,707
...but I know this gentleman.
He's Dr. Jekyll.

1149
01:49:02,874 --> 01:49:05,335
I know.
Nevertheless, there's your man.

1150
01:49:05,502 --> 01:49:08,838
I'm sorry, sir, but I know Dr. Jekyll.
I've known him for years.

1151
01:49:09,005 --> 01:49:12,384
-This is your master, isn't it?
-Of course, sir. No doubt of it.

1152
01:49:12,550 --> 01:49:15,512
-Then we must have lost him. Come, men.
-No, no. Wait.

1153
01:49:16,137 --> 01:49:18,765
Tell them, Jekyll.
Tell them.

1154
01:49:19,099 --> 01:49:21,184
It's no use, Jekyll.

1155
01:49:22,143 --> 01:49:25,689
You know it's no use. I beg of you, Jekyll,
tell them who you are.

1156
01:49:25,855 --> 01:49:29,192
-Tell them what you've done.
-I've done nothing.

1157
01:49:30,068 --> 01:49:32,153
I'm Dr. Jekyll.

1158
01:49:32,696 --> 01:49:34,948
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll.

1159
01:49:36,241 --> 01:49:38,201
I've done nothing.

1160
01:49:38,576 --> 01:49:40,620
I'm Dr. Jekyll.

1161
01:49:41,413 --> 01:49:44,374
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll, I tell you.

1162
01:49:45,458 --> 01:49:47,502
I've done nothing.

1163
01:49:49,421 --> 01:49:52,215
You're looking for a man named Hyde.

1164
01:49:52,382 --> 01:49:53,883
Hyde!

1165
01:49:55,260 --> 01:49:57,929
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll.

1166
01:49:58,930 --> 01:50:01,057
I'm Dr. Jekyll, I tell you!

1167
01:50:01,266 --> 01:50:04,227
I tell you, I'm Dr. Jekyll!

1168
01:50:04,436 --> 01:50:07,105
I'm Dr. Henry Jekyll!

1169
01:50:11,568 --> 01:50:14,529
It's no use, Jekyll.
You'd better come quietly.

1170
01:51:39,823 --> 01:51:43,702
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

1171
01:51:43,868 --> 01:51:47,706
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

1172
01:51:47,872 --> 01:51:51,209
He leadeth me
beside the still waters.

1173
01:51:51,376 --> 01:51:54,254
He restoreth my soul.

1174
01:51:55,171 --> 01:52:00,468
He leadeth me in the path of righteousness,
for his name's sake.

1175
01:52:00,844 --> 01:52:05,724
Yea, though I walk through the valley
of the shadow of death....
