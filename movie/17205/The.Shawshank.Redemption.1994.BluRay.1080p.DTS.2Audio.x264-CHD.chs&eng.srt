00:02:04,634 --> 00:02:06,732
德弗瑞恩先生
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

10
00:02:06,733 --> 00:02:11,132
…描述一下你太太被谋杀当晚，你曾和她谈过些什么？
...the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.

11
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,433
一些很糟糕的话
It was very bitter.

12
00:02:17,734 --> 00:02:22,133
她说她很高兴我已知道，她不想再偷偷摸摸了
She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around.

13
00:02:23,635 --> 00:02:27,135
她说她想离婚
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.

14
00:02:27,235 --> 00:02:31,034
-你当时有什么反应？ -我对她说我不会在乎的
- What was your response? - I told her I would not grant one.

15
00:02:31,235 --> 00:02:34,635
“在我看见你在雷诺市前，下地狱吧！”
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

16
00:02:34,636 --> 00:02:37,936
你的邻居曾听你说过这些话吧？
Those were your words, according to your neighbors.

17
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:40,635
随他们怎么说
If they say so.

18
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:43,936
我当时很不开心，什么都不记得了
I really don't remember. I was upset.

19
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:46,436
你和太太争吵后发生了什么事？
What happened after you argued with your wife?

20
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:49,336
她收拾好行李
She packed a bag.

21
00:02:50,537 --> 00:02:53,637
到昆汀先生家里去了
She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.

22
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:58,337
格伦・昆汀，职业高尔夫教练
Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

23
00:02:58,638 --> 00:03:01,738
你知道他是你妻子的情人
... whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.

24
00:03:04,039 --> 00:03:05,238
你跟踪她了吗？
Did you follow her?

25
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,937
我先去了几间酒吧找
I went to a few bars first.

26
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:13,238
接着，我开车去了昆汀家，但他们不在家里
Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.

27
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,339
我把车停在街角
I parked in the turnout...

28
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,239
等在那里
... and waited.

29
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,939
有何企图吗？
With what intention?

30
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,939
我不太确定
I'm not sure.

31
00:03:22,141 --> 00:03:23,739
我非常困惑
I was confused...

32
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:24,839
还有点醉
... drunk.

33
00:03:26,341 --> 00:03:27,840
我觉得
I think...

34
00:03:27,841 --> 00:03:30,140
我只是想吓一吓他们
... mostly I wanted to scare them.

35
00:03:30,141 --> 00:03:33,541
他们到家后，你就进屋杀了他们
When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.

36
00:03:34,542 --> 00:03:36,140
没有，我控制了自己
I was sobering up.

37
00:03:36,141 --> 00:03:39,941
我开车回家睡觉来忘记一切
I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.

38
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:43,142
在回家的路上，我把枪扔进了河里
Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.

39
00:03:43,143 --> 00:03:45,342
我很肯定这一点
I've been very clear on this point.

40
00:03:45,343 --> 00:03:49,343
但我感到奇怪的是，第二天早上清洁女工发现……
I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...

41
00:03:49,643 --> 00:03:52,442
你太太和她的情人死在床上
...and finds your wife in bed with her lover...

42
00:03:52,443 --> 00:03:54,542
致死的子弹是出自点38口径的手枪
...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

43
00:03:55,943 --> 00:03:59,943
德福瑞恩先生，你和我一样都觉得那是巧合吗？
Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

44
00:04:01,044 --> 00:04:02,243
确实是巧合
Yes, it does.

45
00:04:02,244 --> 00:04:05,543
你仍坚持说你在凶案发生前
Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river...

46
00:04:05,544 --> 00:04:07,843
已经把枪扔进河里了吗？
...before the murders took place.

47
00:04:07,845 --> 00:04:10,044
这对你很有利
That's very convenient.

48
00:04:10,345 --> 00:04:11,944
这是事实
It's the truth.

49
00:04:12,346 --> 00:04:17,144
警察在河里找了三天，但他们没有找到你的枪……
The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...

50
00:04:17,145 --> 00:04:21,145
所以无法鉴定
...so no comparison could be made between your gun and the bullets...

51
00:04:21,446 --> 00:04:24,846
死者身上的子弹是否出自你的枪
...taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

52
00:04:25,546 --> 00:04:27,945
这对你来说
And that also...

53
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:31,847
也非常有利，不是吗，德福瑞恩先生？
...is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

54
00:04:33,147 --> 00:04:35,446
因为我是无辜的……
Since I am innocent of this crime...

55
00:04:35,447 --> 00:04:40,046
所以我发现找不到枪对我非常不利
...I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.

56
00:04:57,949 --> 00:05:01,549
各位先生女士，你们听到了所有的证据
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.

57
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:05,550
我们有他犯罪的动机，我们找到他的脚印
We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.

58
00:05:05,551 --> 00:05:08,650
留有他的指纹的子弹头
Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.

59
00:05:08,651 --> 00:05:11,750
打碎的酒瓶上也留有他的指纹
A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.

60
00:05:11,751 --> 00:05:13,550
最重要的是
And most of all...

61
00:05:13,551 --> 00:05:16,850
我们知道他的妻子和她的情人
... we have a beautiful young woman and her lover...

62
00:05:16,851 --> 00:05:18,850
双双倒卧在血泊中
... lying dead in each other's arms.

63
00:05:20,052 --> 00:05:22,651
他们是犯了错
They had sinned.

64
00:05:23,852 --> 00:05:26,651
但他们所犯的错严重到……
But was their crime so great...

65
00:05:26,652 --> 00:05:29,051
……需要用死来赎罪吗？
... as to merit a death sentence?

66
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:31,352
当你们考虑时
While you think about that...

67
00:05:32,853 --> 00:05:34,652
请想想这个……
...think about this:

68
00:05:35,453 --> 00:05:39,452
一个弹匣只能装六颗子弹，而不是八颗
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

69
00:05:39,453 --> 00:05:43,352
我肯定这不只是一时冲动而犯下的罪行
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.

70
00:05:43,353 --> 00:05:46,353
那至少是可以理解的，即使不能宽恕
That at least could be understood, if not condoned.

71
00:05:46,354 --> 00:05:47,553
不！
No.

72
00:05:47,554 --> 00:05:48,653
这是复仇
This was revenge...

73
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:53,553
一个冷血者的复仇，看看这些：
...of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

74
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:55,954
每个死者都身中四枪
Four bullets per victim.

75
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:58,454
总共是八枪而不是六枪
Not six shots fired, but eight.

76
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:02,755
那表明子弹打完后
That means that he fired the gun empty...

77
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:04,655
他还停下来装子弹
... and then stopped to reload...

78
00:06:04,956 --> 00:06:08,555
以便再次向他们开枪
... so that he could shoot each of them again.

79
00:06:08,556 --> 00:06:11,155
每人多加一枪
An extra bullet per lover...

80
00:06:11,956 --> 00:06:13,655
就在头部
... right in the head.

81
00:06:17,157 --> 00:06:21,956
德弗瑞恩先生，我觉得你非常冷血
You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

82
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,557
看着你都令我毛骨耸然
It chills my blood just to look at you.

83
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:29,457
我以本州赋予我的权利
By the power vested in me by the state of Maine...

84
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:33,757
判处你两项终身监禁
...I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back...

85
00:06:34,059 --> 00:06:36,658
分别为两位死者，退庭！
...one for each of your victims. So be it!

86
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:02,960
坐下来
Sit.

87
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:10,261
你因被判终身监禁己在此二十年？
We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?

88
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:14,462
-是的，先生 -你感到后悔吗？
- Yes, sir. - You feel you've been rehabilitated?

89
00:07:14,862 --> 00:07:17,461
是的，绝对有，先生
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

90
00:07:18,563 --> 00:07:20,562
我是说，我得到了教训
I mean, I learned my lesson.

91
00:07:21,664 --> 00:07:25,064
我敢说我已经完全改变了
I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.

92
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,863
我不会再危害社会
I'm no longer a danger to society.

93
00:07:30,864 --> 00:07:32,863
这是神的真理
That's God's honest truth.

94
00:07:37,564 --> 00:07:39,263
“不合格”

95
00:08:09,168 --> 00:08:10,667
嗨，瑞德
Hey, Red.

96
00:08:10,668 --> 00:08:12,167
怎么样了？
How'd it go?

97
00:08:12,168 --> 00:08:14,567
不同的日子，同样的结果
Same old shit, different day.

98
00:08:14,568 --> 00:08:16,667
我知道你的感受的
Yeah, I know how you feel.

99
00:08:16,668 --> 00:08:18,667
我下星期又要被否决了
I'm up for rejection next week.

100
00:08:19,469 --> 00:08:22,168
对，我上星期也被否决了
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

101
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:23,668
一向如此
It happens.

102
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,268
嗨，瑞德，给我一包烟
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

103
00:08:25,269 --> 00:08:28,569
滚开！你已欠我五包烟了
Get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.

104
00:08:28,869 --> 00:08:29,768
-是四包！ -五包！
Four!

105
00:08:30,970 --> 00:08:34,569
我想在美国的每个联邦或州监狱里都有像我一样的人物
There must be a con like me in every prison in America.

106
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,569
就是能够给你搞到东西的家伙
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

107
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,870
定制的香烟，一包大麻……
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing...

108
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:43,570
为庆祝你儿子或女儿高中毕业的一瓶白兰地， 只要你喜欢
... bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.

109
00:08:43,571 --> 00:08:45,870
或者几乎所有东西……
Damn near anything within reason.

110
00:08:45,871 --> 00:08:49,571
是的，先生，我是个冷酷的人
Yes, sir! I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

111
00:08:52,572 --> 00:08:55,671
所以1949年当安迪・德福瑞恩来找我
So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949...

112
00:08:55,672 --> 00:08:59,472
问能否弄张丽塔・海华丝的图片进来时 （丽塔・海华丝：Rita，Hayworth）
... and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

113
00:08:59,473 --> 00:09:01,672
我告诉他没问题
... I told him, "No problem."

114
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:45,976
安迪・杜福雷在1947年来到肖申克监狱
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

115
00:09:45,977 --> 00:09:49,877
罪名是谋杀他的妻子和她的情人
... in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.

116
00:09:50,178 --> 00:09:54,178
入狱以前，他是波特兰银行的副总裁
On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.

117
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,476
对他来说是年青有为
Good work for a man so young.

118
00:10:01,677 --> 00:10:02,876
好啊，瑞德

119
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:41,681
你会说英语吗？
You speak English, butt-steak?

120
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,581
跟着这个长官走
You follow this officer.

121
00:10:56,383 --> 00:11:00,383
我一生中从没见过这么差劲的人
I never seen such a sorry-Iooking heap of maggot shit in all my life.

122
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:03,483
过来啊！到这里来
Hey, fish! Come over here!

123
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:28,085
今天要赌吗，瑞德？
Taking bets today, Red?

124
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:30,386
赌烟还是赌钱？
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

125
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:32,086
香烟，我赌两根
Smokes. Put me down for two.

126
00:11:32,587 --> 00:11:34,386
好吧，你买哪一个？
All right, who's your horse?

127
00:11:34,387 --> 00:11:36,186
那个又矮又瘦的
That little sack of shit.

128
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:41,187
-排在第八的，他会是第一个的 -妈的！我也想买他
- Eighth. He'll be first. - Bullshit! I'll take that action.

129
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:43,587
你输定了，孩子
You're out some smokes, son.

130
00:11:43,588 --> 00:11:45,587
该你下注了
If you're so smart, you call it.

131
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:48,888
我买那边的那个胖子
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

132
00:11:48,889 --> 00:11:51,488
排在第五的那个，我赌四根香烟
The fifth one. Put me down for a quarter deck.

133
00:11:54,689 --> 00:11:56,388
今天又有新人
Fresh fish today!

134
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,689
我们又有的玩了
We're reeling them in!

135
00:11:59,289 --> 00:12:02,989
我承认我初次见到安迪的时候，没什么特别的感觉
I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.

136
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,389
他看起来似乎风一吹就会倒
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

137
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,089
这就是我对他的第一印象
That was my first impression of the man.

138
00:12:09,091 --> 00:12:10,689
你买谁？
What do you say?

139
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:14,190
那个高个子
That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.

140
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:16,590
那个人？不可能的
That guy? Never happen.

141
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:18,990
-我赌十根香烟 -那可是大赌注
- 10 cigarettes. - That's a rich bet.

142
00:12:18,991 --> 00:12:21,290
谁来证明我看错了？
Who's going to prove me wrong?

143
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:23,091
海伍德？济格？
Heywood? Jigger?

144
00:12:23,392 --> 00:12:24,891
史基？
Skeets?

145
00:12:24,892 --> 00:12:26,191
弗洛德？
Floyd!

146
00:12:27,192 --> 00:12:29,191
四个胆小鬼
Four brave souls.

147
00:12:29,493 --> 00:12:32,392
回囚房去，要查房了
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

148
00:12:32,393 --> 00:12:35,693
所有犯人都回囚房去
All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.

149
00:12:56,095 --> 00:12:57,394
向右转
Turn to the right!

150
00:12:57,395 --> 00:12:58,694
往前看
Eyes front.

151
00:13:11,797 --> 00:13:14,596
这是哈德利先生，他是这里的看守长
This is Mr. Hadley. He's captain of the guards.

152
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:16,896
我是诺顿，这里的典狱长
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

153
00:13:16,897 --> 00:13:19,096
你们都被判有罪了
You are convicted felons.

154
00:13:19,397 --> 00:13:21,396
因此被送到这里来
That's why they've sent you to me.

155
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:23,596
规则一
Rule number one:

156
00:13:23,598 --> 00:13:25,097
不得亵渎上帝
No blasphemy.

157
00:13:25,598 --> 00:13:29,197
在我的监狱里不得有人亵渎上帝
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison.

158
00:13:29,198 --> 00:13:30,597
其他的条例……
The other rules...

159
00:13:30,598 --> 00:13:33,898
其他的条例，你们慢慢就会知道了，还有问题吗？
...you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?

160
00:13:34,299 --> 00:13:35,398
何时吃饭？
When do we eat?

161
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:46,299
我们叫你吃的时候你就吃
You eat when we say you eat.

162
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:49,799
叫你去厕所你就去厕所
You shit when we say you shit, and piss when we say you piss.

163
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,599
明白吗？笨蛋？
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

164
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,999
站好
On your feet.

165
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:58,000
我只相信两样东西
I believe in two things:

166
00:13:58,001 --> 00:14:00,500
纪律和圣经
Discipline and the Bible.

167
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:03,001
在这里，你们两样都有
Here, you'll receive both.

168
00:14:03,802 --> 00:14:06,001
把你们的思想交给上帝
Put your trust in the Lord.

169
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,800
你们的身体交给我
Your ass belongs to me.

170
00:14:10,702 --> 00:14:12,601
欢迎来到肖申克监狱
Welcome to Shawshank.

171
00:14:17,703 --> 00:14:19,102
解开他们
Unhook them.

172
00:14:24,503 --> 00:14:25,902
转过身
Turn around.

173
00:14:32,704 --> 00:14:34,203
够了
That's enough.

174
00:14:35,104 --> 00:14:37,103
到笼子边上去
Move to the end of the cage.

175
00:14:38,105 --> 00:14:40,604
转身，给他消毒
Turn around. Delouse him.

176
00:14:42,806 --> 00:14:44,005
转身
Turn around.

177
00:14:46,906 --> 00:14:49,805
出来，去领你们的衣服和圣经
Move out of the cage. Pick up your clothes and Bible.

178
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,105
下一个！
Next man up!

179
00:14:53,406 --> 00:14:55,005
往右走
To the right.

180
00:14:55,007 --> 00:14:56,106
右边，右边
Right. Right.

181
00:14:56,706 --> 00:14:57,905
左边
Left.

182
00:14:58,307 --> 00:15:02,107
毫无疑问，第一晚是最难熬的
The first night's the toughest. No doubt about it.

183
00:15:02,507 --> 00:15:05,906
赤裸裸的进囚笼，就像刚出生时那样
They march you in naked as the day you were born...

184
00:15:05,907 --> 00:15:09,707
消毒药粉令皮肤像被火烧一样
... skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit.

185
00:15:10,308 --> 00:15:12,907
他们把你丢进囚笼
And when they put you in that cell...

186
00:15:12,908 --> 00:15:15,307
关上铁门
... and those bars slam home...

187
00:15:15,809 --> 00:15:17,908
那时你才感到这是真实的
... that's when you know it's for real.

188
00:15:18,609 --> 00:15:21,609
瞬间过去的一切都离你而去
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

189
00:15:22,109 --> 00:15:26,109
剩下的只有对过去的回忆
Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.

190
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:30,610
很多新来的人在第一晚都几乎发疯了
Most new fish come close to madness the first night.

191
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,909
有些人甚至还痛哭流涕
Somebody always breaks down crying.

192
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:36,109
一向都如此的
Happens every time.

193
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:39,009
唯一的问题是
The only question is...

194
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:40,710
谁会是第一个呢？
... who's it going to be?

195
00:15:42,111 --> 00:15:45,111
我想那是用来赌博的最佳玩意
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

196
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:48,810
我把赌注押在杜福雷身上
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

197
00:15:57,812 --> 00:15:59,511
熄灯
Lights out!

198
00:16:20,015 --> 00:16:22,314
我还记得我在这里的第一晚
I remember my first night.

199
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:26,114
似乎是很久以前的事了
Seems like a long time ago.

200
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,015
嗨，新来的
Hey, fish.

201
00:16:32,016 --> 00:16:33,815
新来的
Fish, fish.

202
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,115
你怕黑吗？
What are you, scared of the dark?

203
00:16:39,516 --> 00:16:42,415
我打赌，你希望你爸和你妈从没把你生下来
Bet you wish your daddy never dicked your mama!

204
00:16:42,417 --> 00:16:45,817
蠢猪！
Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.

205
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:57,418
他们总是喜欢逗新人
The boys always go fishing with first-timers.

206
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:00,718
不达目的，誓不罢休
And they don't quit till they reel someone in.

207
00:17:02,119 --> 00:17:03,718
嗨，胖子
Hey, Fat Ass.

208
00:17:05,219 --> 00:17:06,518
胖子！
Fat Ass!

209
00:17:07,719 --> 00:17:09,418
聊天吧
Talk to me, boy.

210
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:13,018
我知道你在那里，我能听见你的呼吸声
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

211
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:16,219
别理别人怎么说，你听到吗？
Don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me?

212
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,119
这地方没那么差劲
This place ain't so bad.

213
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,719
这样吧
Tell you what...

214
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:24,120
我介绍你认识他们，就像一家人
...I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home.

215
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,919
我知道有几个人
I know a couple of big old bull queers that'd just...

216
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:30,119
会很乐意认识你的
...Iove to make your acquaintance.

217
00:17:30,121 --> 00:17:33,521
尤其是你那又白又嫩的屁股
Especially that big, white, mushy butt of yours.

218
00:17:33,821 --> 00:17:34,820
天啊！
God!

219
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,121
我不属于这里
I don't belong here!

220
00:17:37,122 --> 00:17:40,221
-嗨，有人赢了 -我要回家
- We have a winner! - I want to go home!

221
00:17:40,222 --> 00:17:42,921
是胖子
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

222
00:17:45,722 --> 00:17:47,421
新人！
Fresh fish!

223
00:17:53,523 --> 00:17:55,422
我要回家
I want to go home!

224
00:17:56,324 --> 00:17:57,823
我要见我妈妈
I want my mother!

225
00:17:57,824 --> 00:18:00,023
我操过你妈妈！她不怎么样
I had your mother! She wasn't that great!

226
00:18:04,425 --> 00:18:06,624
发生了什么事？
What the Christ is this horseshit?

227
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:08,924
他讲粗话，我要告诉典狱官
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

228
00:18:08,925 --> 00:18:11,524
告诉他我操你屁股吧
You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!

229
00:18:11,525 --> 00:18:12,524
让我出去
Let me out!

230
00:18:12,526 --> 00:18:16,125
胖子，你想怎么样？
What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

231
00:18:16,126 --> 00:18:19,126
求求你！我不该在这里的
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

232
00:18:19,626 --> 00:18:20,925
不该是我
Not me!

233
00:18:20,926 --> 00:18:23,425
我不会警告你的
I won't count to three. Not even to one.

234
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:25,525
马上你闭上你的臭嘴，否则有你受的！
You shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

235
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:28,725
-闭嘴，闭嘴 -求求你……
Shut up, man. Shut up!

236
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:32,326
你不明白的，我不该在这里的
You don't understand. I'm not supposed to be here.

237
00:18:32,327 --> 00:18:33,826
把囚笼打开
Open that cell.

238
00:18:33,827 --> 00:18:37,127
我也是！这里被他们弄得就像监狱
Me neither! They run this place like a fucking prison!

239
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:46,627
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch!

240
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:53,828
长官，算了
Captain, take it easy!

241
00:19:16,231 --> 00:19:19,730
如果我今晚听到有半点声音
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here tonight...

242
00:19:19,731 --> 00:19:23,131
我对天发誓，你们会吃不了兜着走
...I swear by God and Jesus, you will all visit the infirmary.

243
00:19:23,632 --> 00:19:26,031
所有的人都不会放过的
Every last motherfucker in here.

244
00:19:29,433 --> 00:19:33,033
把他抬到医疗室去
Call the trustees. Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

245
00:19:47,435 --> 00:19:52,233
德福瑞恩第一晚就让我输了两包烟
His first night in the joint, Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

246
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:55,234
他整晚一言不发
He never made a sound.

247
00:20:10,636 --> 00:20:12,935
北仓三楼，出来
Tier 3 north, clear count!

248
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:15,636
北仓二楼，出来
Tier 2 north, clear count.

249
00:20:16,237 --> 00:20:18,536
南仓三楼，出来
Tier 3 south, clear.

250
00:20:23,438 --> 00:20:24,937
准备出来放风
Prepare to roll out.

251
00:20:28,538 --> 00:20:30,037
出去！
Roll out!

252
00:21:24,043 --> 00:21:26,142
你准备吃那个吗？
Are you going to eat that?

253
00:21:26,844 --> 00:21:29,143
不，我没这打算
I hadn't planned on it.

254
00:21:30,144 --> 00:21:31,443
你介意吗？
Do you mind?

255
00:21:39,945 --> 00:21:41,344
你真不错
That's nice and ripe.

256
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,145
杰克说谢谢你
Jake says thank you.

257
00:21:55,746 --> 00:21:58,846
它从巢里掉下来了
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

258
00:22:00,347 --> 00:22:03,647
我要照顾它直到它会飞为止
I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.

259
00:22:05,147 --> 00:22:06,646
不！他过来了
Oh, no! Here he comes.

260
00:22:09,948 --> 00:22:11,347
早上好，各位
Morning, fellas.

261
00:22:11,648 --> 00:22:13,547
不错的早晨，不是吗？
Fine morning, isn't it?

262
00:22:13,848 --> 00:22:16,347
你们知道我的意思的，对吗？
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

263
00:22:16,348 --> 00:22:18,847
把它们拿出来，把它们排成排……
Send them down. I want them lined up...

264
00:22:18,849 --> 00:22:21,448
非常诱人的一行
...just like a pretty little chorus line.

265
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,748
看看这个
Look at that.

266
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:27,450
我真受不了了
- I can't stand this guy. - Oh, Lord!

267
00:22:28,150 --> 00:22:30,849
瑞查德、维吉尼亚……
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

268
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:32,349
闻我的屁吧
Smell my ass!

269
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:34,349
再闻闻我的
After he smells mine.

270
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:38,749
很遗憾，你下注的那个输了
That's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.

271
00:22:38,750 --> 00:22:41,750
但我很喜欢我下注的那个人
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.

272
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:44,250
我见到他就要亲他一下
I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.

273
00:22:44,952 --> 00:22:48,952
你为何不把香烟分给他点？
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

274
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:50,950
嗨，利奥
Hey, Tyrell.

275
00:22:51,352 --> 00:22:53,351
这周你在医疗室当值是吗？
You pull infirmary duty this week?

276
00:22:54,252 --> 00:22:55,851
我下注的那个怎么样了？
How's my horse doing anyway?

277
00:22:56,252 --> 00:22:57,351
死了
Dead.

278
00:22:58,252 --> 00:23:00,651
哈德利打爆了他的头
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

279
00:23:00,653 --> 00:23:02,852
晚上医生都回家了
Doc had gone home for the night.

280
00:23:03,353 --> 00:23:05,852
可怜的家伙就在那里躺到早上
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

281
00:23:05,853 --> 00:23:08,252
可是那时我们已经无能为力了
By then, there wasn't nothing we could do.

282
00:23:14,554 --> 00:23:15,853
他叫什么？
What was his name?

283
00:23:19,254 --> 00:23:20,553
你说什么？
What'd you say?

284
00:23:22,454 --> 00:23:24,853
我只是想问有人知道他的名字吗？
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

285
00:23:25,455 --> 00:23:28,254
关你屁事，新来的？
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

286
00:23:29,256 --> 00:23:32,356
他叫什么都无所谓了，他已经死了
Doesn't fucking matter what his name was. He's dead.

287
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,457
嗨，有人和你一起吗？
Anybody come at you yet?

288
00:23:58,558 --> 00:24:00,457
有人喜欢你吗？
Anybody get to you yet?

289
00:24:02,059 --> 00:24:04,658
嗨，在这里我们都需要朋友
Hey, we all need friends in here.

290
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:06,558
我可以做你的朋友
I could be a friend to you.

291
00:24:15,859 --> 00:24:17,258
难得手
Hard to get.

292
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,859
我喜欢
I like that.

293
00:24:27,761 --> 00:24:30,961
安迪一开始很自闭
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

294
00:24:31,362 --> 00:24:33,261
我猜他在想办法
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

295
00:24:33,761 --> 00:24:36,560
接受牢里的生活
... trying to adapt to life on the inside.

296
00:24:37,262 --> 00:24:40,462
一个月以后他才开口
Wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth...

297
00:24:40,762 --> 00:24:43,061
和某人谈话
... to say more than two words to somebody.

298
00:24:44,263 --> 00:24:45,862
就像你们所看见的
As it turned out...

299
00:24:46,363 --> 00:24:48,162
那个人就是我
... that somebody was me.

300
00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:58,763
我是安迪・德福瑞恩
I'm Andy Dufresne.

301
00:24:59,964 --> 00:25:01,663
杀妻的银行家
Wife-killing banker.

302
00:25:03,965 --> 00:25:05,264
你为何要杀你的妻子？
Why'd you do it?

303
00:25:05,664 --> 00:25:07,763
我没有杀她
I didn't, since you ask.

304
00:25:08,365 --> 00:25:10,164
你很适应合这里
You're going to fit right in.

305
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:13,064
这儿每个人都是无辜的，你不知道吗？
Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?

306
00:25:13,765 --> 00:25:16,965
-你为进监狱？ -我什么都没做，律师害了我
- What you in here for? - Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

307
00:25:19,966 --> 00:25:22,765
听说你很冷酷
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

308
00:25:22,766 --> 00:25:26,565
你以为自己很了不起，对吗？
You think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?

309
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:28,065
你怎么认为呢？
What do you think?

310
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:31,467
说实话，我还不知道
To tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.

311
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:35,366
我知道你能拿到违禁品
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

312
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,867
我能搞到
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.

313
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:42,467
你能给我个鹤嘴槌吗？
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.

314
00:25:43,168 --> 00:25:44,467
鹤嘴槌
A rock hammer.

315
00:25:44,768 --> 00:25:47,467
-要干什么？ -你关心这个干吗？
- What is it and why? - What do you care?

316
00:25:48,869 --> 00:25:51,768
如果是牙刷我就不会问你，我会开个价钱
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.

317
00:25:51,769 --> 00:25:54,168
但是牙刷没有杀伤力，对吗？
But a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

318
00:25:55,769 --> 00:25:57,168
有道理
Fair enough.

319
00:25:57,570 --> 00:26:00,469
一个鹤嘴槌有六至七英寸长
A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.

320
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,969
-看起来像个小锄子 -锄子？
- Looks like a miniature pickax. - Pickax?

321
00:26:02,971 --> 00:26:04,170
打石用的
For rocks.

322
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:07,970
-石英 -石英？
Quartz?

323
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:15,371
还有云母、页岩……
And some mica, shale...

324
00:26:16,671 --> 00:26:17,870
石灰岩……
...limestone.

325
00:26:18,172 --> 00:26:19,271
这么说吧
So?

326
00:26:20,171 --> 00:26:22,070
我收集石头
So I'm a rock hound.

327
00:26:22,472 --> 00:26:25,572
我想在这里最大限度的重操旧业
At least I was in my old life. I'd like to be again.

328
00:26:25,872 --> 00:26:28,972
或许你想用它们攻击某人
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.

329
00:26:30,473 --> 00:26:32,271
不，我在这里没有敌人
No, I have no enemies here.

330
00:26:32,272 --> 00:26:34,571
不会？等着瞧吧
No? Wait a while.

331
00:26:36,173 --> 00:26:37,772
话说回来
Word gets around.

332
00:26:38,473 --> 00:26:40,972
那对姐妹花很喜欢你
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

333
00:26:42,274 --> 00:26:44,073
特别是伯格斯
Especially Bogs.

334
00:26:45,074 --> 00:26:48,773
就算跟他们说我不好此道也没用
Don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.

335
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:50,373
他们也不是
Neither are they.

336
00:26:50,375 --> 00:26:53,875
是这个地方让他们这样
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

337
00:26:58,375 --> 00:27:02,974
畜牲只知道用暴力，不管他人喜不喜欢
Bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.

338
00:27:02,976 --> 00:27:06,675
如果我是你，我会加倍小心
If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

339
00:27:06,676 --> 00:27:09,475
-谢谢你的忠告 -忠告免费
- Thanks for the advice. - Well, that's free.

340
00:27:09,776 --> 00:27:11,975
你知道我担心什么
You understand my concern.

341
00:27:11,977 --> 00:27:14,576
就算我有麻烦也不会用鹤嘴槌的
If there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.

342
00:27:15,477 --> 00:27:19,477
那我猜你想挖个洞逃出去
Then I'd guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

343
00:27:20,378 --> 00:27:22,077
我说漏了什么？什么东西这么好笑
What did I miss? What's so funny?

344
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:25,176
等你看见鹤嘴槌你就明白了
You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.

345
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:29,477
买这个东西一般要多少钱？
What's an item like this usually go for?

346
00:27:29,479 --> 00:27:31,978
七美元，五金铺的零售价
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

347
00:27:32,479 --> 00:27:35,178
我一般要加20%
My normal markup's 20 percent.

348
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:37,778
但这东西很特殊
But this is a specialty item.

349
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:42,378
风险越大，价钱越高，一口价，10元吧
Risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

350
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:43,778
就10元吧
Ten it is.

351
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,479
你那是浪费钱
Waste of money, if you ask me.

352
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:49,079
为什么？
Why's that?

353
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,480
这里的人喜欢突击检查
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

354
00:27:55,080 --> 00:27:57,279
他们找到鹤嘴槌就会被充公
They find it, you're going to lose it.

355
00:27:57,281 --> 00:27:59,580
被他们发现的话，你别把我供出来
If they catch you, you don't know me.

356
00:27:59,581 --> 00:28:05,382
否则的话就别想再和我做生意了，你明白了吗？
Mention my name, we never do business again.

357
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,294
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?

358
00:28:06,282 --> 00:28:07,781
我知道了
I understand.

359
00:28:09,082 --> 00:28:11,381
谢谢你，你叫……
Thank you, Mr...

360
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:12,381
瑞德
Red.

361
00:28:13,082 --> 00:28:14,381
都叫我瑞德
Name's Red.

362
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:17,481
这名字怎么来的？
Why do they call you that?

363
00:28:21,283 --> 00:28:23,282
可能因为我是半个爱尔兰人吧
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

364
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:34,283
我现在明白他们为何看中他了
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.

365
00:28:35,185 --> 00:28:37,584
他不太说话
He had a quiet way about him...

366
00:28:37,985 --> 00:28:41,985
一举一动都不像普通的人
... a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.

367
00:28:42,485 --> 00:28:44,084
他漫步着
He strolled...

368
00:28:44,085 --> 00:28:48,085
就像在公园里散步
... like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.

369
00:28:48,485 --> 00:28:53,184
像穿了件隐形的外套
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.

370
00:28:55,087 --> 00:28:57,586
可以说
I think it'd be fair to say...

371
00:28:57,587 --> 00:28:59,886
开始我对安迪就有好感
... I liked Andy from the start.

372
00:29:01,387 --> 00:29:05,187
快点！我赶时间的
Let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.

373
00:29:08,587 --> 00:29:10,986
快点
Move it! Come on, move it!

374
00:29:13,688 --> 00:29:16,587
你太太对你好吗？
How you doing? How's the wife treating you?

375
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:56,391
安迪说得很对
Andy was right.

376
00:29:56,392 --> 00:29:58,691
我最终拿到那玩意
I finally got the joke.

377
00:29:58,992 --> 00:30:01,591
用这东西来挖隧道
It would take a man about 600 years...

378
00:30:01,593 --> 00:30:03,992
起码要花六百年
... to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

379
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:10,192
-要书吗？ -今天不用了
- Book? - Not today.

380
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:17,293
要书吗？
Book?

381
00:30:24,595 --> 00:30:26,794
送到德福瑞恩那里去
Delivery for Dufresne.

382
00:30:44,497 --> 00:30:46,096
德福瑞恩，这是你要的书
Here's your book.

383
00:30:51,098 --> 00:30:52,297
谢谢
Thanks.

384
00:30:58,598 --> 00:31:02,298
漂白粉不够用了，你再去后面拿点来
We're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.

385
00:31:39,602 --> 00:31:41,201
这可以弄瞎你的眼睛
This will blind you.

386
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:43,901
亲爱的
Honey, hush.

387
00:31:56,504 --> 00:31:58,703
你不懂
That's it. You fight!

388
00:31:58,704 --> 00:32:00,103
你越挣扎越过瘾
Better that way.

389
00:32:08,405 --> 00:32:11,704
我很想说安迪打赢了
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight...

390
00:32:11,705 --> 00:32:13,704
或者姐妹花放过了他
... and the Sisters let him be.

391
00:32:14,205 --> 00:32:16,304
我希望能这么说
I wish I could tell you that...

392
00:32:16,306 --> 00:32:19,205
但是监狱不是童话世界
... but prison is no fairy-tale world.

393
00:32:20,406 --> 00:32:22,305
他从没提起是谁
He never said who did it.

394
00:32:22,606 --> 00:32:24,205
但我们都很清楚
But we all knew.

395
00:32:29,007 --> 00:32:31,506
事情就这样持续了一段时间
Things went on like that for a while.

396
00:32:31,907 --> 00:32:34,406
监狱里的生活都是常规
Prison life consists of routine...

397
00:32:34,707 --> 00:32:36,706
和更多的常规
... and then more routine.

398
00:32:39,207 --> 00:32:42,707
安迪的脸上经常出现新的伤痕
Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

399
00:32:44,208 --> 00:32:46,207
姐妹花不断地骚扰他
The Sisters kept at him.

400
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:48,508
有时候他能逃脱
Sometimes he was able to fight them off.

401
00:32:48,509 --> 00:32:50,008
但有时不能
Sometimes not.

402
00:32:51,208 --> 00:32:53,307
对安迪来说
And that's how it went for Andy.

403
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:55,708
这已经成了他的常规
That was his routine.

404
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:59,909
我相信最初的两年是最糟糕的
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.

405
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:03,810
我也相信事情再继续这样下去
And I also believe that if things had gone on that way...

406
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:06,609
这个地方会夺去他的精神
... this place would have got the best of him.

407
00:33:07,411 --> 00:33:10,410
但是，在1949年的春天
But then, in the spring of 1949...

408
00:33:10,411 --> 00:33:12,510
上头决定……
... the powers that be decided:

409
00:33:12,511 --> 00:33:16,010
工厂的屋顶需要重修
The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.

410
00:33:16,011 --> 00:33:19,211
我需要12名自愿者工作一星期
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

411
00:33:19,911 --> 00:33:21,410
你们知道的
As you know...

412
00:33:22,112 --> 00:33:25,911
特殊的工作有特殊的好处
...special detail carries with it special privileges.

413
00:33:25,912 --> 00:33:28,311
这是户外劳动
It was outdoor detail...

414
00:33:28,712 --> 00:33:32,712
五月是户外劳动的好时间
... and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.

415
00:33:33,213 --> 00:33:34,712
排好队
Stay in line there.

416
00:33:34,713 --> 00:33:37,913
超过100人报名参加劳动
More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.

417
00:33:42,214 --> 00:33:45,113
威勒斯・E・安戈……
Wallace E. Unger.

418
00:33:45,714 --> 00:33:48,213
艾力斯・瑞丁……
Ellis Redding.

419
00:33:48,215 --> 00:33:49,814
你明白了吧？
Wouldn't you know it?

420
00:33:50,214 --> 00:33:53,714
我和几个我认识的都被选中了
Me and some fellows I know were among the names called.

421
00:33:53,715 --> 00:33:55,714
安迪・德福瑞恩……
Andrew Dufresne.

422
00:33:56,115 --> 00:33:59,115
这只花了我们每人一包烟的代价
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

423
00:33:59,616 --> 00:34:02,214
我当然也像往常一样赚了20%
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

424
00:34:02,215 --> 00:34:05,915
德州的律师打长途给我
So this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from Texas.

425
00:34:05,916 --> 00:34:07,715
我说，“喂？”
I say, "Yeah?"

426
00:34:07,716 --> 00:34:11,616
他说，“很遗憾，你哥哥死了”
He says, " Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died."

427
00:34:11,617 --> 00:34:15,617
-我很难过 -我并不难过，他是个混蛋
- I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm not. He was an asshole.

428
00:34:15,717 --> 00:34:18,116
离家多年，早就当他死了
Ran off years ago. Figured him for dead.

429
00:34:18,117 --> 00:34:20,616
这个律师对我说
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

430
00:34:20,618 --> 00:34:24,618
“他死的时候很富有”，有价值超过百万的油井
"He died a rich man." Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

431
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:27,317
超过百万的？
A million bucks?

432
00:34:27,618 --> 00:34:32,117
-有些混蛋的运气有时候就是好 -有你的份吗？
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get. - You going to see any of that?

433
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,618
三万五千块 那就他留给我的
Thirty-five thousand. That's what he left me.

434
00:34:35,619 --> 00:34:36,818
-美元？ -对
Dollars?

435
00:34:37,619 --> 00:34:40,619
真不错，就像中了彩
That's great! That's like winning the sweepstakes.

436
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,219
不是吗？
Isn't it?

437
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:45,419
笨蛋，你想政府会如何对我？
Dumb shit, what do you think the government will do to me?

438
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,819
他们会拿去一大半
Take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.

439
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,919
可怜的布朗
Poor Byron.

440
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:54,120
真是走运，嗯？奇耻大辱
Terrible fucking luck, huh? Crying shame.

441
00:34:54,121 --> 00:34:56,420
有些人觉得很糟糕
Some people really got it awful.

442
00:34:56,721 --> 00:34:58,220
安迪，你傻了吗？
Andy, are you nuts?

443
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:00,320
看着你的拖把，嘿！
IKeep your eyes on your mop, man!

444
00:35:00,321 --> 00:35:03,520
虽然要交点税，但你还可以……
You'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up...

445
00:35:03,521 --> 00:35:06,521
也许够买辆新车，但接着呢？
Yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what?

446
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,921
你必须为新车上该死的税，维修和保养
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

447
00:35:08,922 --> 00:35:12,622
孩子们会缠着你带着他们兜风
...maintenance, kids pestering you to take them for a ride all the time.

448
00:35:12,922 --> 00:35:16,522
如果年底算错了税金，还要掏自己的腰包
Then if you figure your tax wrong, you pay out of your own pocket.

449
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:19,122
告诉你！山姆叔叔
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

450
00:35:19,123 --> 00:35:23,123
他只是假仁假义
He puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

451
00:35:25,824 --> 00:35:27,923
他在找死，继续干活吧
- Getting himself killed. - IKeep tarring.

452
00:35:28,223 --> 00:35:30,722
什么兄弟，呸！
Some brother. Shit!

453
00:35:35,625 --> 00:35:37,024
哈德利先生
Mr. Hadley...

454
00:35:37,925 --> 00:35:39,324
你信任你太太吗？
...do you trust your wife?

455
00:35:40,925 --> 00:35:42,424
噢，这很有趣
Oh, that's funny.

456
00:35:42,925 --> 00:35:45,724
你给我挨揍的话也许更有趣
You'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.

457
00:35:45,725 --> 00:35:49,125
我是说，你是否会认为她对你不忠？
What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back?

458
00:35:50,226 --> 00:35:53,825
让开点，米特，让他自己出意外
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's having himself an accident.

459
00:35:53,826 --> 00:35:54,825
他会把他推下去的
He'll push him off!

460
00:35:55,127 --> 00:35:56,926
如果你信任她，你就能……
If you trust her, you can keep...

461
00:35:57,226 --> 00:35:58,625
……拿到三万五千元
...that 35,000.

462
00:35:59,327 --> 00:36:01,826
-你说什么？ -三万五千元
- What did you say? - Thirty-five thousand.

463
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:03,926
一分不少
All of it.

464
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:07,127
你最好说明白点，小子，不然你完蛋了
- Every penny. - You better start making sense.

465
00:36:07,128 --> 00:36:09,727
你要拿到这笔钱的话，就把它送给你妻子
If you want to keep it, give it to your wife.

466
00:36:09,728 --> 00:36:13,728
政府允许一次性赠与配偶金额的上限是六万美元
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $ 60,000.

467
00:36:13,828 --> 00:36:16,327
-胡扯！免税的吗？ -免税的
- Bullshit. Tax-free? - Tax-free.

468
00:36:16,329 --> 00:36:18,328
国税局一毛钱也拿不走
IRS can't touch one cent.

469
00:36:18,729 --> 00:36:21,427
你是那个谋杀妻子的银行家吗？
You're that smart banker that killed his wife.

470
00:36:21,428 --> 00:36:25,028
我为何要相信你？
Why should I believe you? So I can end up in here with you?

471
00:36:25,030 --> 00:36:28,029
这是合法的，你可以去问国税局，他们会给你同样的回答
It's legal. Ask the IRS. They'll say the same thing.

472
00:36:28,030 --> 00:36:32,030
我知道即使我不告诉你，你也能查到的
I feel stupid telling you this. I'm sure you would have investigated.

473
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:36,229
我不需要你来教我怎么做
I don't need you to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

474
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:39,830
当然，但你需要有人帮你逃税
Of course not. But you do need someone to set it up for you.

475
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:41,530
你需要请一个律师
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

476
00:36:41,531 --> 00:36:43,830
那些华盛顿的混蛋？
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

477
00:36:44,331 --> 00:36:47,930
我想我能帮你，那你就能省点钱
I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.

478
00:36:47,931 --> 00:36:50,230
我帮你填好文件
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

479
00:36:50,231 --> 00:36:52,030
几乎是免费的
...nearly free of charge.

480
00:36:53,232 --> 00:36:56,532
我只要求给每个同事三瓶啤酒
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.

481
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:59,032
同事？你真的发达了
"Coworkers." That's rich!

482
00:36:59,932 --> 00:37:02,631
一个户外工作的人能有啤酒喝的话
A man working outdoors feels more like a man...

483
00:37:02,632 --> 00:37:06,032
……会感觉更像一个男人，那是我的意见……
...if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion...

484
00:37:06,534 --> 00:37:07,533
长官
...sir.

485
00:37:11,433 --> 00:37:13,632
你们在看什么？
What are you jimmies staring at?

486
00:37:13,634 --> 00:37:15,233
继续干活
Let's go! Work!

487
00:37:24,735 --> 00:37:26,834
就这样
And that's how it came to pass...

488
00:37:26,836 --> 00:37:29,735
在完工前的第二天
... that on the second-to-last day of the job...

489
00:37:29,736 --> 00:37:34,235
在49年的春天里，一群在工厂上面装修的罪犯
... the convict crew that tarred the factory roof in the spring of '49...

490
00:37:34,536 --> 00:37:37,835
早上十点坐在屋顶上
... wound up sitting in a row at 10:00 in the morning...

491
00:37:37,836 --> 00:37:43,535
享受着清凉的啤酒和肖申克最严密的保护
... drinking icy-cold beer, courtesy of the hardest screw...

492
00:37:43,537 --> 00:37:46,936
这种事在肖申克从没有发生
... that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

493
00:37:46,937 --> 00:37:49,436
趁凉喝，女士们。
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

494
00:37:50,538 --> 00:37:55,037
他还装作很大度似的走来走去
The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.

495
00:37:56,238 --> 00:38:00,637
我们坐着喝着啤酒，阳光洒在肩头，觉得是个自由人
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.

496
00:38:01,038 --> 00:38:04,737
感觉就像在装修自己家的屋项
We could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.

497
00:38:04,738 --> 00:38:07,537
我们就像造物主
We were the lords of all creation.

498
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,639
安迪看起来
As for Andy...

499
00:38:09,939 --> 00:38:12,738
也有点不同了
... he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

500
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:15,238
他脸上露出奇怪的笑容
... a strange little smile on his face...

501
00:38:15,540 --> 00:38:17,739
望着我们喝他的啤酒
... watching us drink his beer.

502
00:38:25,841 --> 00:38:27,140
要来点吗？
Want a cold one?

503
00:38:27,841 --> 00:38:30,740
不，谢谢，我戒酒了
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

504
00:38:34,742 --> 00:38:37,842
如果他不和狱警打交道
You could argue he done it to curry favor with the guards.

505
00:38:38,542 --> 00:38:42,342
或许就不能和我们交上朋友
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

506
00:38:43,042 --> 00:38:44,341
我？
Me?

507
00:38:44,343 --> 00:38:47,142
我觉得他这样做只是为了在此感到自由
I think he did it just to feel normal again...

508
00:38:47,543 --> 00:38:49,842
哪怕只是一小会儿
... if only for a short while.

509
00:38:52,443 --> 00:38:53,542
将军
IKing me.

510
00:38:55,444 --> 00:38:58,242
象棋，这是一个王者的游戏，什么？
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings. - What?

511
00:38:58,243 --> 00:38:59,942
文明，战略
Civilized. Strategic.

512
00:39:00,644 --> 00:39:03,644
我一点都没察觉，我讨厌这样
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

513
00:39:03,944 --> 00:39:05,643
改天我教教你吧
Let me teach you someday.

514
00:39:07,244 --> 00:39:08,243
好的
Sure.

515
00:39:08,745 --> 00:39:10,644
或许你我可合作
We could get a board together.

516
00:39:10,645 --> 00:39:13,945
你找对人了，我能弄到很多东西
You're talking to the right man. I can get things, right?

517
00:39:13,946 --> 00:39:17,946
我们可以合作做买卖，我来雕刻
We might do business on a board, and I'll carve the pieces myself.

518
00:39:18,146 --> 00:39:21,446
一面是石膏像，另一面是肥皂石，你觉得怎样？
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone. What do you think?

519
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:23,645
这需要很多时间
I think it'll take years.

520
00:39:23,646 --> 00:39:26,345
时间不是问题，只是没有石头
Years I got. What I don't have are the rocks.

521
00:39:26,347 --> 00:39:28,546
操场里拾到的都是小石头
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

522
00:39:28,547 --> 00:39:30,346
大多是鹅卵石
Pebbles, mostly.

523
00:39:34,748 --> 00:39:37,547
安迪，我们是朋友，对吗？
We're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we?

524
00:39:38,348 --> 00:39:39,947
我想是的
Yeah, I guess.

525
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:42,147
我能问你个问题吗？
Can I ask you something?

526
00:39:43,648 --> 00:39:45,047
你为何要杀你妻子？
Why'd you do it?

527
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:48,047
我是清白的，瑞德
I'm innocent, Red.

528
00:39:48,048 --> 00:39:50,047
就像这狱中其他人一样
Just like everybody else here.

529
00:39:54,449 --> 00:39:55,948
你怎会进来的？
What are you in for?

530
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:01,049
和你一样，是谋杀
Murder. Same as you.

531
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,249
清白的？
Innocent?

532
00:40:04,950 --> 00:40:07,349
肖申克监狱里唯一有罪的一个
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

533
00:41:06,656 --> 00:41:08,355
金丝雀在哪里？
Where's the canary?

534
00:41:08,356 --> 00:41:09,855
你怎么知道的？
How did you know?

535
00:41:09,856 --> 00:41:12,355
-我怎么知道？ -原来你不知道
- How did I know what? - So you don't know.

536
00:41:12,357 --> 00:41:13,556
来
Come.

537
00:41:16,057 --> 00:41:18,156
金丝雀就在那里
This is where the canary is.

538
00:41:20,758 --> 00:41:24,158
在我家听到女人唱歌很惊讶是吗？
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing in my house, eh?

539
00:41:27,658 --> 00:41:29,057
那确实令我……
That's quite a...

540
00:41:29,959 --> 00:41:31,658
很惊讶
... surprise.

541
00:41:35,959 --> 00:41:37,358
等等
Wait, wait.

542
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:39,358
她出场了
Here she comes.

543
00:41:39,659 --> 00:41:42,758
我最爱看她摆弄头发那场戏
I like this part when she does that shit with her hair.

544
00:41:42,759 --> 00:41:45,658
我知道，这个月已经看了三遍了
I know. I've seen it three times this month.

545
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:47,559
吉达，你好吗？
Gilda, are you decent?

546
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:49,659
我？
Me?

547
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,159
天啊，我喜欢这场戏
God, I love it.

548
00:41:59,361 --> 00:42:02,361
我明白你什么都弄得到
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

549
00:42:03,361 --> 00:42:07,261
是的，要什么有什么，你要什么？
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. What do you want?

550
00:42:07,262 --> 00:42:09,461
-丽塔・海华丝 -什么？
- Rita Hayworth. - What?

551
00:42:09,962 --> 00:42:11,361
你能找到她吗？
Can you get her?

552
00:42:12,762 --> 00:42:16,162
你就是强尼吗，久闻大名了
So this is Johnny Farrel. I've heard a lot about you.

553
00:42:17,363 --> 00:42:19,862
-要几个星期的时间 -几个星期？
- Take a few weeks. - Weeks?

554
00:42:19,863 --> 00:42:24,262
很抱歉，现在她又没有坐在我的大腿上。
I don't have her stuffed down the front of my pants right now, sorry to say.

555
00:42:24,863 --> 00:42:26,362
但我能找到的
But I'll get her.

556
00:42:26,364 --> 00:42:27,663
放松些
Relax.

557
00:42:29,564 --> 00:42:30,863
谢谢
Thanks.

558
00:42:51,466 --> 00:42:53,465
-滚出去！ -我要换带子了
- Get out! - I got to change reels!

559
00:42:53,466 --> 00:42:55,465
我说了，滚出去
I said fuck off!

560
00:43:01,567 --> 00:43:02,966
你打算大叫吗？
Ain't you going to scream?

561
00:43:04,368 --> 00:43:06,167
让我们做个了结吧
Let's get this over with.

562
00:43:11,268 --> 00:43:13,267
他打爆了我的鼻子
He broke my fucking nose!

563
00:43:22,569 --> 00:43:23,868
现在
Now...

564
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:26,468
我要拉开拉链
...I'm going to open my fly...

565
00:43:26,769 --> 00:43:29,468
我给你什么吃你就吃下什么
...and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.

566
00:43:30,670 --> 00:43:33,469
然后再吃罗斯的，你打爆了他的鼻子
Then you'll swallow Rooster's. You broke his nose.

567
00:43:33,470 --> 00:43:35,769
他该得到点补偿
He ought to have something to show for it.

568
00:43:35,770 --> 00:43:37,869
我会咬断任何放进我嘴里的东西
You put it in my mouth, you lose it.

569
00:43:37,871 --> 00:43:40,470
不，你还没明白
No, you don't understand.

570
00:43:40,771 --> 00:43:43,771
你那样做的话我就把刀插进你的耳朵
Do that and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.

571
00:43:44,071 --> 00:43:47,670
好吧，但你得知道突如其来的脑部撞击
All right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury...

572
00:43:47,671 --> 00:43:49,870
会令受害人剧烈反应
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

573
00:43:49,872 --> 00:43:53,372
事实上，我听说受害者会咬紧牙关
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong...

574
00:43:54,172 --> 00:43:56,771
要用铁棍
...they have to pry the victim's jaws open...

575
00:43:56,772 --> 00:43:58,171
才能撬开他的嘴巴
...with a crowbar.

576
00:44:01,173 --> 00:44:02,871
你怎么知道的？
Where do you get this shit?

577
00:44:02,872 --> 00:44:04,271
从书里看到的
I read it.

578
00:44:05,673 --> 00:44:08,372
你不会看书？白痴？
You know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

579
00:44:10,074 --> 00:44:11,073
亲爱的
Honey!

580
00:44:13,074 --> 00:44:14,773
你不应该这样的
You shouldn't!

581
00:44:17,474 --> 00:44:20,373
伯格斯没有把任何东西放进安迪的嘴里
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.

582
00:44:20,674 --> 00:44:22,673
他的朋友们也没有
And neither did his friends.

583
00:44:23,175 --> 00:44:26,975
他们只是把他揍了个半死
What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life.

584
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:30,174
安迪在疗养院里整整躺了一个月
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

585
00:44:30,976 --> 00:44:33,475
伯格斯则被锁进黑房关了一周
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

586
00:44:37,576 --> 00:44:39,075
伯格斯，时间到了
Time's up, Bogs.

587
00:44:42,877 --> 00:44:44,576
遵命，头
It's your world, boss.

588
00:44:47,878 --> 00:44:50,877
回到你的囚仓，等着查房
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

589
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:53,477
所有犯人返回囚房
All prisoners report for lock down.

590
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:09,479
什么事？
What?

591
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:24,579
-他要到哪里去？ -抓住他
- Where's he going? - Grab his ankles.

592
00:45:30,481 --> 00:45:31,680
救命
Help!

593
00:45:35,382 --> 00:45:37,981
之后，有两件事再也没发生过了
Two things never happened again after that.

594
00:45:38,282 --> 00:45:41,382
姐妹花再也不敢惹安迪了
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.

595
00:45:42,182 --> 00:45:44,681
而伯格斯再也没有站起来
And Bogs would never walk again.

596
00:45:45,882 --> 00:45:49,582
他被送到一个特殊医院去
They transferred him to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

597
00:45:49,583 --> 00:45:52,582
据我所知，他在下半生中……
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days...

598
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:54,382
都只能靠饮筒来进食
... drinking his food through a straw.

599
00:45:55,383 --> 00:45:59,383
我想给安迪开个欢迎会庆祝他复原
Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.

600
00:46:01,284 --> 00:46:02,783
听起来很不错
Sounds good to us.

601
00:46:03,084 --> 00:46:05,583
啤酒的事我们还欠他的情
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

602
00:46:06,285 --> 00:46:08,584
他喜欢下象棋
The man likes to play chess.

603
00:46:09,085 --> 00:46:10,984
给他找点石头吧
Let's get him some rocks.

604
00:46:43,841 --> 00:46:45,140
伙计们
Guys!

605
00:46:45,841 --> 00:46:47,140
我找到一块
I got one.

606
00:46:47,142 --> 00:46:48,641
我找到一块，看
I got one. Look!

607
00:46:50,542 --> 00:46:54,542
希伍德，那不是皂石，也不是石膏
Heywood, that isn't soapstone! And it ain't alabaster either.

608
00:46:54,842 --> 00:46:56,941
你们他妈的是地质学家吗？
What are you, a fucking geologist?

609
00:46:56,942 --> 00:46:58,841
他是对的，这不是我们要找的
He's right. It ain't.

610
00:46:58,843 --> 00:47:01,742
-这到底是什么？ -粪球
- What the hell is it then? - It's a horse apple.

611
00:47:02,743 --> 00:47:05,342
-胡扯！ -不，是马粪
- Bullshit! - No, horseshit.

612
00:47:05,343 --> 00:47:06,842
晒干了的
Petrified.

613
00:47:15,845 --> 00:47:17,044
他妈的
Damn!

614
00:47:17,344 --> 00:47:21,344
不久，他们开始认识石头
Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style.

615
00:47:21,745 --> 00:47:23,944
当安迪在周末回来的时候
And by the weekend he was due back...

616
00:47:23,945 --> 00:47:27,645
我们已经找到足够多的石头让他忙个不停
... we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till rapture.

617
00:47:28,307 --> 00:47:30,806
那个星期我也收到很大批货
Also got a big shipment in that week.

618
00:47:31,107 --> 00:47:32,206
香烟
Cigarettes...

619
00:47:32,507 --> 00:47:33,706
口香糖
... chewing gum...

620
00:47:33,707 --> 00:47:35,406
威土忌
... sipping whisky...

621
00:47:35,407 --> 00:47:39,006
画着裸女的扑克牌
... playing cards with naked ladies on them. You name it.

622
00:47:39,007 --> 00:47:41,706
当然，最重要的是
And of course, the most important item:

623
00:47:43,608 --> 00:47:45,607
丽塔・海华丝
Rita Hayworth herself.

624
00:48:08,405 --> 00:48:11,238
“欢迎归来,免费享用”

625
00:48:22,711 --> 00:48:25,210
注意，要查房了
Heads up. They're tossing cells.

626
00:48:25,212 --> 00:48:27,911
注意，要查房了
Heads up. They're tossing cells!

627
00:48:28,225 --> 00:48:29,749
119房
119.

628
00:48:32,129 --> 00:48:33,153
123房
123.

629
00:48:45,014 --> 00:48:45,813
站起来
On your feet.

630
00:48:48,414 --> 00:48:49,913
面向墙站好
Face the wall.

631
00:49:24,118 --> 00:49:26,017
转过身面向典狱长
Turn around and face the warden.

632
00:49:32,619 --> 00:49:34,618
很高兴看见你在看这本书
Pleased to see you reading this.

633
00:49:36,019 --> 00:49:37,918
特别喜欢哪一章？
Any favorite passages?

634
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:41,318
看到你，就知道……
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not...

635
00:49:41,319 --> 00:49:43,618
你是精神之主
...when the master of the house cometh."

636
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:46,919
马可福音第十三章三十五节
Mark 13:35.

637
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,519
我一向都喜欢那一章
I've always liked that one.

638
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:52,119
但我更喜欢
But I prefer...

639
00:49:52,621 --> 00:49:54,420
我是世界的光
..." I am the light of the world.

640
00:49:54,920 --> 00:49:58,419
跟随我就不会步入黑暗，而能得到生命的光
Ye that followeth me shall have the light of life."

641
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,019
约瑟福音第八章第十二节
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

642
00:50:01,321 --> 00:50:03,520
我听说你精通数学
I hear you're good with numbers.

643
00:50:03,521 --> 00:50:04,520
不错
How nice.

644
00:50:05,821 --> 00:50:07,720
人总得有一技之长
Man should have a skill.

645
00:50:10,221 --> 00:50:11,320
这个你怎么解释
Explain this.

646
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:16,422
这是纱纸，打磨石头用的
It's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

647
00:50:17,023 --> 00:50:18,922
这是我的小嗜好
A little hobby of mine.

648
00:50:29,724 --> 00:50:31,423
相当干净
It's pretty clean.

649
00:50:31,424 --> 00:50:34,524
看来没什么古怪的
Some contraband here, but nothing to get in a twist over.

650
00:50:38,924 --> 00:50:40,923
这是未经我批准的
I can't say I approve of this.

651
00:50:42,525 --> 00:50:44,024
但是……
But I suppose...

652
00:50:46,026 --> 00:50:48,025
凡事总有例外
...exceptions can be made.

653
00:50:58,427 --> 00:50:59,826
锁门！
Lock them up!

654
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:04,226
差点忘记了
I almost forgot.

655
00:51:04,727 --> 00:51:06,826
我不能取走它的
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

656
00:51:07,627 --> 00:51:09,726
救赎之道就在其中
Salvation lies within.

657
00:51:09,728 --> 00:51:10,827
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

658
00:51:19,329 --> 00:51:21,928
查房其实只是个藉口
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

659
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:23,828
事实上
Truth is...

660
00:51:23,829 --> 00:51:26,328
诺顿是想考察一下
... Norton wanted to size Andy up.

661
00:51:33,043 --> 00:51:36,012

我太太在教堂做的
My wife made that in church group.

663
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:46,229
很不错，先生
Very nice, sir.

664
00:51:47,831 --> 00:51:49,330
喜欢洗衣房的工作吗？
You enjoy working the laundry?

665
00:51:50,932 --> 00:51:52,631
不，先生，不是特别喜欢
No, sir. Not especially.

666
00:51:53,031 --> 00:51:55,430
或许我们能做点别的……
Perhaps we can find something more...

667
00:51:55,732 --> 00:51:58,131
利用你的学识
...befitting a man of your education.

668
00:52:06,233 --> 00:52:07,732
杰克，布鲁斯呢？
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

669
00:52:09,533 --> 00:52:12,332
安迪，我听到你来了
I thought I heard you out here.

670
00:52:13,034 --> 00:52:14,533
我来跟你工作
I've been reassigned to you.

671
00:52:14,834 --> 00:52:17,133
我知道，他们跟我说了
I know, they told me.

672
00:52:18,034 --> 00:52:20,233
也是被踢伤的吗？
Ain't that a kick in the head?

673
00:52:20,234 --> 00:52:22,733
我来带你看看吧
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

674
00:52:22,734 --> 00:52:23,933
来吧
Come on.

675
00:52:25,335 --> 00:52:27,234
就在这儿
Well, here she is.

00:52:42,836 --> 00:52:46,435
每晚我推车四处走
Every evening I load up the cart and make my rounds.

683
00:52:46,436 --> 00:52:49,135
名字写在这板上
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

684
00:52:49,637 --> 00:52:52,336
很容易的工作
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

685
00:52:53,138 --> 00:52:56,037
-有问题吗？ -你当了多久的图书管理员
- Any questions? - How long have you been librarian?

686
00:52:57,238 --> 00:53:01,238
我1905年入狱，1912年在此工作
I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.

687
00:53:02,539 --> 00:53:04,738
你一直都有助手吗？
And have you ever had an assistant?

688
00:53:05,039 --> 00:53:07,438
没有，工作不是那么忙
No. Not much to it, really.

689
00:53:08,139 --> 00:53:09,438
那为什么现在让我来？
Why me? Why now?

690
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:11,338
我不知道
I don't know.

691
00:53:11,339 --> 00:53:14,339
但我很高兴有个伴
But it'd be nice to have some company down here.

692
00:53:14,478 --> 00:53:15,240
德福瑞恩

693
00:53:25,641 --> 00:53:27,940
就是他
That's him. That's the one.

694
00:53:35,542 --> 00:53:36,741
我叫迪格斯
I'm Dekins.

695
00:53:37,141 --> 00:53:38,740
我想……
I was thinking...

696
00:53:39,442 --> 00:53:43,342
为儿子申请助学金
...about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

697
00:53:47,243 --> 00:53:48,642
我明白了
I see.

698
00:53:53,743 --> 00:53:56,743
坐下来谈好吗？
Why don't we have a seat and talk it over.

699
00:53:59,944 --> 00:54:02,944
布鲁斯，你有纸和笔吗？
Do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

700
00:54:14,245 --> 00:54:15,544
谢谢
Thanks.

701
00:54:16,246 --> 00:54:17,245
那么
So...

702
00:54:19,046 --> 00:54:20,845
迪格斯先生
Mister Dekins...

703
00:54:21,645 --> 00:54:23,944
接着安迪问迪格斯
And then Andy says, " Mr. Dekins...

704
00:54:23,946 --> 00:54:27,145
你想让你的儿子去哈佛还是耶鲁？
...do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?"

705
00:54:27,146 --> 00:54:28,245
他没有这样说
He didn't say that!

706
00:54:28,547 --> 00:54:31,046
上帝可以作证
As God as my witness!

707
00:54:31,347 --> 00:54:33,246
迪格斯愣了一会儿
Dekins blinked for a second...

708
00:54:33,247 --> 00:54:36,347
傻笑着和安迪握手
...then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.

709
00:54:36,848 --> 00:54:39,047
老天！和他握手
- My ass! - Shook his hand.

710
00:54:39,347 --> 00:54:42,446
我告诉你们，我感到……
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

711
00:54:42,447 --> 00:54:46,447
安迪若穿上那套衣服
All he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

712
00:54:46,948 --> 00:54:49,447
他就会变成德福瑞恩先生的了
...he'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

713
00:54:49,749 --> 00:54:51,348
安迪，又交上新朋友了？
Making a few friends?

714
00:54:52,649 --> 00:54:54,548
我不认为是朋友
I wouldn't say "friends."

715
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:58,548
我是一个能提供准确财政计划的谋杀犯
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.

716
00:54:58,549 --> 00:55:01,048
只是某人不错的仆人
It's a wonderful pet to have.

717
00:55:01,050 --> 00:55:02,849
至少可以令你离开洗衣房
Got you out of the laundry, though.

718
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:05,249
可能不是那么简单的
It might do more than that.

719
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:08,149
我打算扩大图书馆，找点新书
How about expanding the library. Get some new books.

720
00:55:08,150 --> 00:55:10,749
还是找张台球桌吧
If you ask for something, ask for a pool table.

721
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:15,650
你打算怎么做，我是说
How do you expect to do that? I mean...

722
00:55:15,651 --> 00:55:18,651
怎么得到新书，向谁请求
...get new books in here, "Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

723
00:55:19,151 --> 00:55:21,150
我会向典狱长要钱
I'll ask the warden for funds.

724
00:55:22,052 --> 00:55:26,551
噢，孩子，孩子，我经历了六个典狱长，懂得了一条
Six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned...

725
00:55:26,552 --> 00:55:29,051
一个事实，宇宙真理
...one immutable, universal truth:

726
00:55:29,052 --> 00:55:30,651
那个人还没有生出来
Not one born whose asshole...

727
00:55:30,653 --> 00:55:35,652
你向他们提出定遭拒绝的
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.

728
00:55:36,453 --> 00:55:39,553
-预算不够用 -我知道
- The budget's stretched thin as it is. - I see.

729
00:55:39,653 --> 00:55:43,293
或许我写信向参议员提出
Maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.

730
00:55:43,333 --> 00:55:47,333
只有三种情况能动纳税人的钱
They have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:

731
00:55:47,654 --> 00:55:50,213
多建围墙、多建牢房和增加监狱
More walls, more bars, more guards.

732
00:55:50,254 --> 00:55:53,093
若你批准，我想尝试一下，每周一封信
I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.

733
00:55:53,134 --> 00:55:55,853
-他们不能永不理会 -当然能够
- They can't ignore me forever. - Sure can.

734
00:55:56,134 --> 00:55:58,853
如果你写着高兴那就写吧
But you write your letters if it makes you happy.

735
00:55:59,135 --> 00:56:01,734
我来替你寄出，怎样？
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

736
00:56:03,336 --> 00:56:06,296
就这样，安迪开始每周写一封信
So Andy started writing a letter a week...

737
00:56:06,336 --> 00:56:07,935
就像他说得那样
... just like he said.

738
00:56:12,136 --> 00:56:14,895
但如诺顿所说
And like Norton said...

739
00:56:14,937 --> 00:56:16,456
一直都无回覆
... Andy got no answers.

740
00:56:24,657 --> 00:56:29,536
过了四月，安迪已帮半数狱警们报税
The following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.

741
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,357
后来，全都找他帮忙了
Year after that, he did them all...

742
00:56:33,358 --> 00:56:35,287
连典狱长纳税务都由他处理
... including the warden's.

743
00:56:37,028 --> 00:56:40,668
后来，他们安排
Year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season...

744
00:56:40,710 --> 00:56:43,109
球队在税季中比赛
... to coincide with tax season.

745
00:56:44,710 --> 00:56:49,389
所有的球队都带着报税表
The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.

746
00:56:49,029 --> 00:56:50,468
所以莫尔斯比监狱……
So Moresby Prison...

747
00:56:50,510 --> 00:56:52,989
配给你一支枪，但要你自己付钱
...issued you a gun, but you paid for it.

748
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,869
对，连手枪皮套也是
Right. The holster too.

749
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,589
那可以减免税款，你可把它记下来
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.

750
00:56:57,630 --> 00:57:00,630
是的！安迪就像一个正常的会计师
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.

751
00:57:01,311 --> 00:57:05,830
事实上，在税季中他如此的忙，允许有一个帮手
In fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.

752
00:57:06,111 --> 00:57:08,790
瑞德，你可以取1040号表格来吗？
Could you hand me a stack of 1040s?

753
00:57:08,832 --> 00:57:13,631
每年有一个月离开监狱去木工场做工
Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.

754
00:57:14,832 --> 00:57:18,032
同时，安迪仍旧不断的写信
And still, he kept sending those letters.

755
00:57:24,834 --> 00:57:25,833
安迪、瑞德，布鲁斯出事了
It's Brooks.

756
00:57:26,913 --> 00:57:28,432
看着门
Watch the door.

757
00:57:28,714 --> 00:57:30,033
冷静点，布鲁斯
Please, Brooks.

758
00:57:30,313 --> 00:57:32,112
千万别冲动，放下来！
- Calm the fuck down. - Stay back!

759
00:57:32,514 --> 00:57:35,113
-放下来，该死！ -发生什么事？
- Stay back, goddamn it! - What's going on?

760
00:57:35,434 --> 00:57:38,073
他突然掏出刀来
One second he's fine, then out come the knives.

761
00:57:38,115 --> 00:57:39,914
有事慢慢商量好吗？
We can talk about this, right?

762
00:57:40,235 --> 00:57:43,915
没商量余地的，我要割断他的喉咙
There's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.

763
00:57:44,235 --> 00:57:46,074
他有什么对不起你？
What's he done to you?

764
00:57:46,116 --> 00:57:47,835
去问狱警吧
It's what they done!

765
00:57:48,315 --> 00:57:49,634
我别无选择
I got no choice.

766
00:57:50,036 --> 00:57:52,475
我们都知道，你不会伤害海伍德的
You won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.

767
00:57:52,516 --> 00:57:55,195
-对吗，海伍德？ -是的
- Right, Heywood? - Sure.

768
00:57:55,236 --> 00:57:58,796
他是你的朋友，布鲁斯是讲道理的
He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.

769
00:57:58,837 --> 00:57:59,916
对吗？
Right, guys?

770
00:58:00,917 --> 00:58:03,436
那么把刀放下，看着我
So put the knife down. Look at me.

771
00:58:03,717 --> 00:58:05,916
把刀放下
Put the knife down.

772
00:58:07,837 --> 00:58:09,916
看看他的脖子
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

773
00:58:10,718 --> 00:58:13,037
看看他的脖子，他在流血
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

774
00:58:13,918 --> 00:58:15,597
这是唯一
It's the only way...

775
00:58:15,638 --> 00:58:17,637
使我留在这里的办法
...they'd let me stay.

776
00:58:17,918 --> 00:58:20,477
你疯了，你不会这样做的
This is crazy. You don't want to do this.

777
00:58:20,518 --> 00:58:22,637
放下，放下刀
Put it, put it down.

778
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:32,779
放松
Take it easy.

779
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:35,119
一切都会好的
You'll be all right.

780
00:58:36,120 --> 00:58:37,879
他？那么我呢？
Him? What about me?

781
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,479
这个愚蠢的疯子差点割断我的喉咙
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

782
00:58:40,520 --> 00:58:42,599
你就连刮胡子也比这刮得厉害
You've had worse from shaving.

783
00:58:42,641 --> 00:58:44,880
究竟怎么会这样？
What did you do to set him off?

784
00:58:44,921 --> 00:58:47,240
没什么，我只是进来和他道别
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.

785
00:58:47,842 --> 00:58:50,441
难到你没听说？他获得假释
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

786
00:58:52,841 --> 00:58:55,801
我就是不明白，发生什么了
I just don't understand what happened in there.

787
00:58:55,842 --> 00:58:58,802
老家伙疯了
Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.

788
00:58:58,842 --> 00:59:00,881
够了
That's enough out of you.

789
00:59:00,922 --> 00:59:03,641
-我听说你吓得尿流 -去你妈的
- Heard he had you shitting your pants. - Fuck you.

790
00:59:03,923 --> 00:59:05,122
不要说了！
IKnock it off.

791
00:59:06,043 --> 00:59:07,522
布鲁斯不是疯了
Brooks ain't no bug.

792
00:59:11,324 --> 00:59:13,123
他只是被体制化了
He's just institutionalized.

793
00:59:14,524 --> 00:59:16,603
体制化？什么东西？
"Institutionalized," my ass.

794
00:59:16,644 --> 00:59:20,644
他在此已有五十年了，海伍德，五十年！
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!

795
00:59:20,845 --> 00:59:22,684
这是他唯一认识的地方
This is all he knows.

796
00:59:22,724 --> 00:59:25,203
在这儿，他是个重要的人
In here, he's an important man...

797
00:59:25,245 --> 00:59:26,324
一个有教养的人
...an educated man.

798
00:59:27,125 --> 00:59:29,124
在外面，他什么都不是
Outside, he's nothing.

799
00:59:29,925 --> 00:59:31,604
只是一个假释出来的囚犯
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

800
00:59:32,646 --> 00:59:36,646
申请张借书证都有困难
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

801
00:59:36,926 --> 00:59:38,645
你明白我说的话吗？
You know what I'm trying to say?

802
00:59:38,926 --> 00:59:41,845
瑞德，我相信你说是屁话
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

803
00:59:43,126 --> 00:59:45,325
怎么想随你吧
You believe whatever you want.

804
00:59:45,927 --> 00:59:48,326
我告诉你，这些围墙很有趣的
But I tell you these walls are funny.

805
00:59:49,928 --> 00:59:51,647
开始，你恨它们
First you hate them.

806
00:59:53,448 --> 00:59:55,327
接着，你适应了它们
Then you get used to them.

807
00:59:57,328 --> 00:59:59,327
时间久了
Enough time passes...

808
00:59:59,928 --> 01:00:01,927
你开始离不开它们
...you get so you depend on them.

809
01:00:02,928 --> 01:00:05,287
那就是被体制化了
That's "institutionalized."

810
01:00:05,329 --> 01:00:06,808

Shit.

811
01:00:06,848 --> 01:00:09,647
-我永远不会那样的 -对吗？
- I could never get like that. - Oh, yeah?

812
01:00:10,530 --> 01:00:13,209
因为你没布鲁斯那样长时间在此
Wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.

813
01:00:13,249 --> 01:00:14,848
太对了
Goddamn right.

814
01:00:17,450 --> 01:00:19,329
他们把你送到这里来生活
They send you here for life...

815
01:00:20,050 --> 01:00:22,329
这就是他们确实想要做的
...that's exactly what they take.

816
01:00:24,050 --> 01:00:26,009
无论怎样已经部分达到了
Part that counts, anyway.

817
01:00:34,151 --> 01:00:37,050
我不能再照顾你了，杰克
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

818
01:00:38,232 --> 01:00:39,951
你走吧
You go on now.

819
01:00:41,152 --> 01:00:42,631
你自由了
You're free.

820
01:00:43,953 --> 01:00:45,552
你自由了
You're free.

821
01:01:04,555 --> 01:01:06,234
布鲁斯，祝你好运
Good luck, Brooksie.

822
01:01:44,158 --> 01:01:45,637
大家好
Dear fellas:

823
01:01:45,959 --> 01:01:49,959
外面的改变令我难以想像
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.

824
01:01:51,438 --> 01:01:54,157
老头，找死啊？
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?

825
01:01:55,359 --> 01:01:58,839
我童年时只见过一次汽车
I saw an automobile once when I was a kid...

826
01:01:59,559 --> 01:02:01,958
但现在到处都是
... but now they're everywhere.

827
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:09,959
世界在一片巨大的忙碌之中
The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.

828
01:02:25,762 --> 01:02:29,442
假释委员会给我安排了中途宿舍
The parole board got me into this halfway house...

829
01:02:29,842 --> 01:02:31,601
叫做“酿酒人”
... called "The Brewer"...

830
01:02:31,642 --> 01:02:33,001
和一份工作
... and a job...

831
01:02:33,043 --> 01:02:36,043
在一家杂货店里包装食物
... bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

832
01:02:37,563 --> 01:02:40,122
虽然很辛苦，但我很努力工作
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

833
01:02:40,163 --> 01:02:42,562
我的手经常感到酸痛
... but my hands hurt most of the time.

834
01:02:42,844 --> 01:02:45,003
记得用两层袋
Make sure your man double-bags.

835
01:02:45,044 --> 01:02:47,043
上次几乎穿底了
Last time, the bottom near came out.

836
01:02:47,765 --> 01:02:50,805
听到那女士说的吗？
Make sure you double-bag like the lady says. Understand?

837
01:02:50,845 --> 01:02:52,404
是的，先生
Yes, sir. Surely will.

838
01:02:52,444 --> 01:02:55,964
我想那店主不太喜欢我
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.

839
01:02:58,965 --> 01:03:03,244
有时工作完后，我到公园里去喂那些鸽子
Sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.

840
01:03:03,766 --> 01:03:05,165
我一直希望
I keep thinking...

841
01:03:05,445 --> 01:03:08,765
杰克会飞来和我打招呼
... Jake might just show up and say hello.

842
01:03:09,366 --> 01:03:11,365
但它从未来过
But he never does.

843
01:03:12,567 --> 01:03:17,446
我希望，不管在哪，它都过的很好，又交到新朋友
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.

844
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:23,766
晚上我不能入睡
I have trouble sleeping at night.

845
01:03:24,048 --> 01:03:27,368
经常作恶梦，身体像一直往下掉
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

846
01:03:27,648 --> 01:03:30,007
醒来时感到恐惧
I wake up scared.

847
01:03:30,048 --> 01:03:34,167
要想一会儿才知道自己在哪儿
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.

848
01:03:35,769 --> 01:03:40,768
也许我该用枪打劫，让他们好送我回家
Maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

849
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:45,369
我可以打死那个店主，当作额外补助
I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

850
01:03:47,050 --> 01:03:51,050
但我已经太老了，再也干不了这种蠢事
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.

851
01:03:51,250 --> 01:03:53,129
我不喜欢这地方
I don't like it here.

852
01:03:53,171 --> 01:03:57,171
它令我感到害怕，我决定……
I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided...

853
01:03:58,050 --> 01:03:59,649
离开
... not to stay.

854
01:04:10,652 --> 01:04:13,331
我怀疑他们会争论
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

855
01:04:13,372 --> 01:04:16,852
但不是为我这个老坏蛋
... not for an old crook like me.

856
01:05:03,853 --> 01:05:07,721
“老布来此一游”

857
01:05:19,179 --> 01:05:23,458
我怀疑他们会争论，但不是为我这种老坏蛋
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.

858
01:05:24,459 --> 01:05:28,419
另外，跟海伍德说，上次的事很对不起，别放在心上
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

859
01:05:28,459 --> 01:05:30,858
不再有痛苦的感觉了，布鲁斯
No hard feelings. Brooks."

860
01:05:41,260 --> 01:05:43,259
他应该死在这儿
He should have died in here.

861
01:05:48,782 --> 01:05:50,181
你该死的做了什么？
What the fuck have you done?

862
01:05:50,461 --> 01:05:53,060
一团糟，我来告诉你
It's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.

863
01:05:58,662 --> 01:06:02,382
-这些都是什么？ -你告诉我，全都寄给你的
- What's all this? - You tell me. They're addressed to you.

864
01:06:03,663 --> 01:06:04,982
拿着
Take it.

865
01:06:13,464 --> 01:06:14,983
亲爱的德弗瑞恩先生
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

866
01:06:16,184 --> 01:06:18,223
应你的来信请求，州政府拨给……
In response to your inquiries...

867
01:06:18,314 --> 01:06:22,593
你的图书馆计划经费
...the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project."

868
01:06:23,384 --> 01:06:25,343
这是200元
This is $ 200.

869
01:06:25,385 --> 01:06:29,335
而州立图书馆
"In addition, the library district has generously responded...

870
01:06:29,578 --> 01:06:32,137
捐出旧书和日常用品
...with a donation of used books and sundries.

871
01:06:32,347 --> 01:06:36,475
这些应是你所需要的，而此事亦告一段落
We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.

872
01:06:36,685 --> 01:06:38,481
恳请阁下勿再来信
Please stop sending us letters."

873
01:06:38,719 --> 01:06:41,382
典狱长回来前要清理好
Clear all this out before the warden gets back.

874
01:06:41,623 --> 01:06:42,783
知道
Yes, sir.

875
01:06:47,062 --> 01:06:48,222
安迪，真不错
Good for you, Andy.

876
01:06:51,201 --> 01:06:52,325
哦！
Wow!

877
01:06:53,537 --> 01:06:55,469
只用了六年时间
It only took six years.

878
01:06:57,040 --> 01:06:59,769
由现在起，我每星期写两封信
From now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.

879
01:06:59,977 --> 01:07:03,310
你真的很疯狂，把这儿清理干净
I believe you're crazy enough. Get this stuff out...

880
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:04,409
照他说的办
...like he said.

881
01:07:04,615 --> 01:07:06,014
我去厕所
I've got to pinch a loaf.

882
01:07:06,217 --> 01:07:07,682
回来时
When I come back...

883
01:07:07,885 --> 01:07:09,648
不想见到这些书
...this is all gone, all right?

884
01:07:58,409 --> 01:07:59,806
安迪，听到了吗？
Do you hear that?

885
01:09:08,550 --> 01:09:09,710
德弗瑞恩！
Dufresne!

886
01:09:12,253 --> 01:09:13,777
安迪，让我出去
Andy, let me out!

887
01:09:16,839 --> 01:09:17,703
安迪

888
01:09:20,663 --> 01:09:25,600
我到今天也没不明白，这两个意大利女人在唱着什么
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.

889
01:09:25,904 --> 01:09:28,132
事实上，我也不想去明白
Truth is, I don't want to know.

890
01:09:28,338 --> 01:09:30,828
有些东西不说更好
Some things are best left unsaid.

891
01:09:34,414 --> 01:09:37,142
我想那是，如此的美
I like to think it was something so beautiful...

892
01:09:37,348 --> 01:09:39,476
无法用语言来形容
... it can't be expressed in words...

893
01:09:39,687 --> 01:09:42,585
美得让你心痛
... and makes your heart ache because of it.

894
01:09:44,255 --> 01:09:46,745
我告诉你，那声音飞翔
I tell you, those voices soared...

895
01:09:47,027 --> 01:09:51,326
比在这个灰暗地方的任何一个人梦想的都要高远
... higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.

896
01:09:51,533 --> 01:09:54,899
像一只美丽的小鸟，飞进了我们这灰色的鸟笼
It was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage...

897
01:09:55,103 --> 01:09:57,866
让这些围墙消失了
... and made those walls dissolve away.

898
01:09:58,305 --> 01:10:00,500
在那一刻
And for the briefest of moments...

899
01:10:00,707 --> 01:10:03,699
每个在肖申克的落伍者，感到了的自由
... every last man at Shawshank felt free.

900
01:10:06,280 --> 01:10:08,943
但那令典狱长极度愤怒
It pissed the warden off something awful.

901
01:10:10,252 --> 01:10:11,239
开门
Open the door.

902
01:10:14,155 --> 01:10:15,917
开门！
Open it up!

903
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:19,953
德弗瑞恩，开门
Dufresne, open this door!

904
01:10:21,298 --> 01:10:22,490
把它关掉！
Turn that off!

905
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:31,828
我警告你，德弗瑞恩！把它关掉
I am warning you. Turn that off!

906
01:10:45,440 --> 01:10:46,439
德弗瑞恩

907
01:10:49,872 --> 01:10:51,362
你落到我手里了
You're mine now.

908
01:10:58,483 --> 01:11:01,681
安迪被关禁闭两周
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.

909
01:11:01,781 --> 01:11:03,339
站起来
On your feet.

910
01:11:05,186 --> 01:11:06,852
-看看谁回来了 -大艺术家！
- Hey, look who's here. - Maestro!

911
01:11:09,186 --> 01:11:12,815
你就不能放些好听的吗，嗯？比如汉克.威廉姆斯！
You couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?

912
01:11:13,026 --> 01:11:15,790
还没来得及接受点播，他们就破门进来了
They broke the door down before I could take requests.

913
01:11:15,906 --> 01:11:19,000
-被关了两周，值得吗？ -那是我最好的时光
- Was it worth two weeks? - Easiest time I ever did.

914
01:11:19,606 --> 01:11:23,770
没有被关小号容易过的事，那个地方一个星期就像一年
- No such thing as easy time in the hole. - A week in the hole is like a year.

915
01:11:23,830 --> 01:11:27,095
对，我有莫扎特先生陪我
- Damn straight. - I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

916
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:30,125
他们让你带留声机到那儿？
So they let you tote that record player down there, huh?

917
01:11:33,074 --> 01:11:34,405
它就在这儿
It was in here.

918
01:11:35,186 --> 01:11:36,380
在这儿
In here.

919
01:11:37,458 --> 01:11:39,517
这就是音乐的魅力，他们……
That's the beauty of music. They...

920
01:11:39,666 --> 01:11:41,964
不能把它从你这儿夺走
...can't get that from you.

921
01:11:45,298 --> 01:11:47,630
你们从没此感觉吗？
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

922
01:11:49,298 --> 01:11:52,392
我年轻时曾学过吹口琴
Well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.

923
01:11:53,298 --> 01:11:54,959
可是，现在已经失去兴趣了
Lost interest in it, though.

924
01:11:55,122 --> 01:11:56,680
因为在这里没有任何意义
Didn't make much sense in here.

925
01:11:56,978 --> 01:11:58,946
这里才是它最有意义的地方
Here's where it makes the most sense.

926
01:11:59,409 --> 01:12:01,434
你需要它就不会忘记它
You need it so you don't forget.

927
01:12:01,938 --> 01:12:03,098
忘记？
Forget?

928
01:12:03,442 --> 01:12:06,502
忘记有一些
Forget that there are...

929
01:12:06,610 --> 01:12:08,009
地方
...places...

930
01:12:09,966 --> 01:12:13,766
在这个世界上，不是用石头围成
...in the world that aren't made out of stone.

931
01:12:14,796 --> 01:12:16,263
有些东西……
There's something...

932
01:12:16,822 --> 01:12:18,187
在内心……
...inside...

933
01:12:18,422 --> 01:12:20,356
不能到达……
...that they can't get to...

934
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:21,833
……不能触摸
...that they can't touch.

935
01:12:22,326 --> 01:12:23,725
属于你
That's yours.

936
01:12:25,174 --> 01:12:26,732
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

937
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:29,171
希望
Hope.

938
01:12:30,185 --> 01:12:31,482
希望
Hope.

939
01:12:33,320 --> 01:12:35,288
我告诉你，我的朋友
Let me tell you something, my friend.

940
01:12:36,009 --> 01:12:38,273
希望是很危险的东西
Hope is a dangerous thing.

941
01:12:39,821 --> 01:12:42,517
希望会让人疯狂
Hope can drive a man insane.

942
01:12:42,892 --> 01:12:44,985
它在这儿没用
It's got no use on the inside.

943
01:12:45,132 --> 01:12:47,293
你最好习惯这想法
You'd better get used to that idea.

944
01:12:49,643 --> 01:12:51,110
就像布鲁斯？
Like Brooks did?

945
01:13:16,591 --> 01:13:17,558
坐下
Sit down.

946
01:13:22,671 --> 01:13:25,936
你因终身监禁在此三十年
Says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.

947
01:13:27,402 --> 01:13:29,427
觉得自己被改造了吗？
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

948
01:13:29,578 --> 01:13:30,772
是的，先生
Oh, yes, sir.

949
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:33,276
毫无疑问
Without a doubt.

950
01:13:34,678 --> 01:13:37,044
老实说我己改过
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

951
01:13:38,903 --> 01:13:40,803
我已不会危害社会
No danger to society here.

952
01:13:41,571 --> 01:13:43,061
上帝可以作证
God's honest truth.

953
01:13:45,507 --> 01:13:47,566
真的改变了
Absolutely rehabilitated.

954
01:13:52,507 --> 01:13:53,566
“不合格”

955
01:13:57,749 --> 01:13:59,046
三十年
Thirty years.

956
01:14:01,053 --> 01:14:02,918
当你这样说时
Jesus, when you say it like that...

957
01:14:03,708 --> 01:14:05,437
想过是怎样过的吗？
You wonder where it went.

958
01:14:07,773 --> 01:14:09,866
我在想十年是怎样过去的
I wonder where 10 years went.

959
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:15,587
这儿
Here.

960
01:14:16,727 --> 01:14:19,389
这是庆祝你假释被拒绝的礼物
A little parole rejection present.

961
01:14:20,671 --> 01:14:22,298
打来看看吧
Go ahead and open it.

962
01:14:23,474 --> 01:14:25,442
跟你的竞争对手买的
Went through one of your competitors.

963
01:14:25,710 --> 01:14:28,770
别介意，我想让它给你一个惊喜
I hope you don't mind. I wanted it to be a surprise.

964
01:14:38,889 --> 01:14:40,322
它真漂亮
It's very pretty.

965
01:14:42,094 --> 01:14:43,220
谢谢你
Thank you.

966
01:14:45,863 --> 01:14:47,296
你会用它来吹奏吗？
You going to play it?

967
01:14:51,902 --> 01:14:53,096
不
No.

968
01:14:56,774 --> 01:14:58,139
不会是现在
Not right now.

969
01:15:15,861 --> 01:15:16,885
关上！
Roll in!

970
01:15:32,861 --> 01:15:34,885
“这个新女孩给你纪念十周年，安迪”

971
01:15:53,165 --> 01:15:54,325
熄灯
Lights out!

972
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:31,126
安迪说到做到……
Andy was as good as his word.

973
01:16:31,502 --> 01:16:34,267
他每周写两封信
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

974
01:16:36,340 --> 01:16:40,437
1959年，州议员最后终于面对现实
In 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact...

975
01:16:40,679 --> 01:16:43,807
那200元的支票起不了作用
... they couldn't buy him off with just a $ 200 check.

976
01:16:44,014 --> 01:16:48,314
最后通过每年拨款500元
Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500...

977
01:16:48,518 --> 01:16:50,420
来让他闭嘴
... just to shut him up.

978
01:16:50,621 --> 01:16:53,613
随后安迪所说的令你感到更意外
And you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.

979
01:16:53,825 --> 01:16:56,759
他跟读书会和慈善机构谈至
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

980
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:59,725
他用剩下来的钱来买书
He bought remaindered books by the pound...

981
01:17:00,232 --> 01:17:01,755
《金银岛》
Treasure Island.

982
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:03,630
罗伯特・路易斯……
Robert Louis...

983
01:17:03,835 --> 01:17:04,858
斯蒂文森
Stevenson.

984
01:17:05,069 --> 01:17:06,434
科幻类，冒险类
Fiction, adventure.

985
01:17:09,006 --> 01:17:10,031
下一本是什么？
What's next?

986
01:17:10,242 --> 01:17:13,301
是汽车修理
I got here Auto Repair...

987
01:17:14,045 --> 01:17:15,205
和肥皂雕刻技术
...and Soap Carving.

988
01:17:15,412 --> 01:17:18,643
技术与爱好，教育性那一栏
Trade skills and hobbies. Under "Educational," behind you.

989
01:17:18,849 --> 01:17:20,715
《基督山伯爵》
Count of Monte Crisco.

990
01:17:21,185 --> 01:17:23,483
那书不值一看
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

991
01:17:24,039 --> 01:17:25,027
作者是亚历山大……
By Alexandree...

992
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:26,768
……什么……马
...Dum-ass.

993
01:17:27,508 --> 01:17:28,533
“草泥马”
Dumb ass.

994
01:17:30,846 --> 01:17:31,904
“草泥马”？
Dumb ass?

995
01:17:34,815 --> 01:17:36,783
是大仲马。德弗瑞恩，知道那是什么故事吗？
Dumas. IKnow what that's about?

996
01:17:39,053 --> 01:17:41,021
讲越狱的，你喜欢看的
You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

997
01:17:41,222 --> 01:17:45,124
那我觉得应该发到“教育类”，对吧？
We ought to file that under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

998
01:17:45,993 --> 01:17:50,090
我们其余的随时尽可能帮忙
The rest of us did our best to pitch in when and where we could.

999
01:17:50,664 --> 01:17:52,427
到了肯尼迪遇刺那一年
By the year Kennedy was shot...

1000
01:17:52,667 --> 01:17:57,160
安迪把一个充满松脂味的储藏间
... Andy had transformed a storage room smelling of turpentine...

1001
01:17:57,471 --> 01:18:00,565
变成了新英格兰州最好的的监狱图书馆
... into the best prison library in New England...

1002
01:18:01,275 --> 01:18:04,211
那里有最好的汉克威廉姆斯唱片集
... complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1003
01:18:11,586 --> 01:18:13,520
那也是诺顿典狱长发展大计的一年
That was also when Warden Norton...

1004
01:18:13,721 --> 01:18:16,657
推广他著名的“内在改造”计划
... instituted his famous "Inside Out" program.

1005
01:18:17,124 --> 01:18:19,184
你可能从报纸上读到过
You may remember reading about it.

1006
01:18:19,427 --> 01:18:22,521
所有的媒体都刊出他的照片
It made the papers and got his picture in Look magazine.

1007
01:18:22,730 --> 01:18:24,028
这不是放任的方式
It's no free ride...

1008
01:18:24,231 --> 01:18:27,462
……而是一种真正的进步
...but rather a genuine progressive advance...

1009
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:30,159
……让犯人恢复道德
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

1010
01:18:30,504 --> 01:18:33,029
收容人被适当的监督
Our inmates, properly supervised...

1011
01:18:33,240 --> 01:18:35,868
使他们能在外面工作
...will be put to work outside these walls...

1012
01:18:36,078 --> 01:18:39,038
为大众服务
...performing all manner of public service.

1013
01:18:39,314 --> 01:18:41,545
他们会懂得劳动的价值
These men can learn the value...

1014
01:18:41,750 --> 01:18:45,550
为社会服务的诚实劳动
...of an honest day's labor and provide a service to the community...

1015
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:50,452
在最低耗支情况下，来利用纳税人的金钱
...at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

1016
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,524
当然，诺顿没有跟报界说
Of course he didn't tell the press...

1017
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:57,186
“最低耗支”其实是相当不确切的说法
... that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term.

1018
01:18:57,499 --> 01:19:00,525
有很多办法能瞒天过海的
There are 100 different ways to skim off the top.

1019
01:19:00,735 --> 01:19:03,226
人力，物力，你说多少就多少
Men, materials, you name it.

1020
01:19:03,771 --> 01:19:06,672
上帝，钱是这样滚入！
And oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in!

1021
01:19:06,874 --> 01:19:09,400
继续这样，我不用干了
At this rate, you'll put me out of business.

1022
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:14,047
有这些劳工，你可比这镇上的承包商出更低价
With this pool of slave labor, you can underbid any contractor in town.

1023
01:19:14,615 --> 01:19:17,584
我们提供有用的社区劳务
We're providing a valuable community service.

1024
01:19:17,785 --> 01:19:21,449
对报界来说很动听，但我要养家活口的
That's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.

1025
01:19:24,126 --> 01:19:25,650
我们走得太远
We go back a long way.

1026
01:19:26,962 --> 01:19:31,899
我需要这份公路的合同，如果拿不到我就完了
I need this highway contract. I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1027
01:19:32,801 --> 01:19:34,597
尝尝我的妻子给你特制的陷饼吧
You have some of this fine pie...

1028
01:19:34,836 --> 01:19:38,168
好好考虑一下
...my missus made for you. You think about that.

1029
01:19:46,448 --> 01:19:49,144
如果我是你对此合同并不担心
I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.

1030
01:19:49,383 --> 01:19:52,444
我已把人手派至别处
I already got my boys committed elsewhere.

1031
01:19:54,422 --> 01:19:57,481
谢谢你太太的糕饼
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1032
01:19:58,592 --> 01:20:00,752
每笔暗盘交易下
And behind every shady deal...

1033
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:03,724
赚来的每一分钱
... behind every dollar earned...

1034
01:20:03,998 --> 01:20:07,059
都是由安迪来作记录的
... there was Andy, keeping the books.

1035
01:20:07,468 --> 01:20:08,730
两笔存款
Two deposits.

1036
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:13,100
文尼国际和新格兰，一天又过去了
Maine National and New England First. Night drops as always, sir.

1037
01:20:43,305 --> 01:20:47,638
-把我的东西拿到洗衣房 -两套衣服要干洗的，还有架上的袋子
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1038
01:20:48,109 --> 01:20:51,636
如果他们再把我的衬衫浆过了头，有他们好受的
If they over-starch my shirts again, they'll hear from me.

1039
01:20:51,846 --> 01:20:53,176
我看上去怎么样？
How do I look?

1040
01:20:54,216 --> 01:20:56,707
-很不错 -这是盛大的慈善晚会
- Very nice. - Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1041
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:58,441
州长也会出席
Governor will be there.

1042
01:20:59,854 --> 01:21:01,320
你要剩下的这些吗？
You want the rest of this?

1043
01:21:02,657 --> 01:21:04,591
烤的太难吃
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1044
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:07,158
谢谢，长官
Thank you, sir.

1045
01:21:09,998 --> 01:21:13,229
我听说这样的派，他收了不少
He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1046
01:21:13,435 --> 01:21:18,270
他有你想象不到的手段，回扣、酬金..
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. IKickbacks on his kickbacks.

1047
01:21:18,472 --> 01:21:20,838
黑钱像河一样流过这里
A river of dirty money running through here.

1048
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:24,876
但他迟早得解释钱是从何而来的
Sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.

1049
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:26,842
这就是我牵涉其中的原因
That's where I come in.

1050
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:29,747
我安排了一切来过滤
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1051
01:21:29,950 --> 01:21:32,783
股票、债券、市政免税……
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1052
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,648
我把钱送到外面，等它们回来的时候……
I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back...

1053
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:39,827
-纯洁得就像个处女 -像洗衣机
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh? - Cleaner.

1054
01:21:40,427 --> 01:21:44,023
到诺顿退休的时候，我已让他成为百万富翁了
By the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.

1055
01:21:46,368 --> 01:21:50,702
如果被他们抓住的话，他将在自己的监狱穿上这样的号码服
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1056
01:21:50,971 --> 01:21:53,667
看来你对我没有信心
I thought you had more faith in me than that.

1057
01:21:53,874 --> 01:21:56,900
我知道你很能干，但是总会蛛丝马迹留下
I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.

1058
01:21:57,111 --> 01:22:00,512
只要有人想细查，FBI，国税局
Now anybody gets curious, FBI, IRS...

1059
01:22:00,715 --> 01:22:01,703
不管怎样
...whatever.

1060
01:22:02,150 --> 01:22:03,446
总会有人被牵扯
It'll lead to somebody.

1061
01:22:03,651 --> 01:22:07,520
是的，但不会是我，也不会是典狱长
Sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.

1062
01:22:11,892 --> 01:22:12,882
那会是谁？
All right, who?

1063
01:22:13,093 --> 01:22:14,685
兰度・史蒂文
Randall Stevens.

1064
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,162
谁？
Who?

1065
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:18,355
从不出声的拍档
The "silent" silent partner.

1066
01:22:18,565 --> 01:22:21,626
他是帐户的持有者，他才有罪
He's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.

1067
01:22:21,836 --> 01:22:23,997
他那里是过滤黑钱过程的起点
It's where the filtering process starts.

1068
01:22:24,204 --> 01:22:27,071
不管他们如何调查，都只会查到他
They trace anything, it'll just lead to him.

1069
01:22:27,676 --> 01:22:28,904
他是什么人？
But who is he?

1070
01:22:29,109 --> 01:22:33,069
他是一个幻影，幽灵，是兔子哈维的第二个表弟
He's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1071
01:22:34,181 --> 01:22:35,342
我凭空……
I conjured him...

1072
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:36,914
造出他来
...out of thin air.

1073
01:22:37,718 --> 01:22:40,449
他只存在于文件中罢了
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1074
01:22:43,525 --> 01:22:45,891
你不能只这么捏造一个人
You can't just make a person up.

1075
01:22:46,093 --> 01:22:49,187
当然可以，如果你知道我们社会系统的漏洞
Sure you can, if you know how the system works.

1076
01:22:49,698 --> 01:22:52,530
吃惊的是邮政就能帮你做到
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1077
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:55,493
史蒂文先生有出生证明书
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1078
01:22:55,703 --> 01:22:57,830
驾驶执照和社会编号
...driver's license, Social Security.

1079
01:22:58,105 --> 01:22:59,095
你在说笑
You're shitting me.

1080
01:22:59,306 --> 01:23:02,673
他们追查帐户的话，只是在追查
If they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing...

1081
01:23:02,877 --> 01:23:04,605
我幻想出来的人
...a figment of my imagination.

1082
01:23:04,812 --> 01:23:06,803
喔，该死
Well, I'll be damned!

1083
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,877
我没说过你很能干吗？
Did I say you were good?

1084
01:23:10,251 --> 01:23:11,877
该死，你简直是伦勃朗
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1085
01:23:12,618 --> 01:23:14,349
有趣的是
The funny thing is...

1086
01:23:14,556 --> 01:23:18,651
……在外面，我是个诚实的人，正直得像杆直箭
...on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.

1087
01:23:19,060 --> 01:23:21,391
变成骗子就不得不到监狱里来
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1088
01:23:30,270 --> 01:23:31,568
你担心过吗？
Ever bother you?

1089
01:23:33,007 --> 01:23:36,066
我没参与，我只是处理收益
I don't run the scams. I just process the profits.

1090
01:23:36,343 --> 01:23:38,334
一条好的分界线，也许吧
A fine line, maybe...

1091
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:40,971
不过我也建起了图书馆
...but I also built that library...

1092
01:23:41,181 --> 01:23:44,208
来帮助囚犯取得高中文凭
...and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.

1093
01:23:44,418 --> 01:23:46,649
你可知他会何会让我做所有这些？
Why do you think he lets me do all that?

1094
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,050
让你开心，好帮他“清洗”……
IKeep you happy and doing the laundry.

1095
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:50,724
洗的是钱而非床单
Money instead of sheets.

1096
01:23:51,092 --> 01:23:53,685
让我工作轻松，那是交易
Well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.

1097
01:24:10,944 --> 01:24:13,573
汤姆・威廉姆斯1965年到肖申克监狱服刑
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965...

1098
01:24:13,815 --> 01:24:16,044
因非法入室行窃，被判两年监禁
... on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1099
01:24:16,283 --> 01:24:18,615
那是对私人的非法入侵
That's breaking and entering to you.

1100
01:24:18,886 --> 01:24:23,118
警察在佩妮家后门抓到，他在电视旁鬼鬼祟祟的
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.

1101
01:24:23,557 --> 01:24:24,855
年轻的朋克
Young punk.

1102
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:26,685
“摇滚”先生
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1103
01:24:26,895 --> 01:24:28,418
过于自大
... cocky as hell.

1104
01:24:28,629 --> 01:24:31,029
快点，老家伙们，慢得跟糖浆一样
Come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!

1105
01:24:31,266 --> 01:24:33,029
我干着急
Making me look bad.

1106
01:24:33,234 --> 01:24:35,030
我们马上就喜欢上他了
We liked him immediately.

1107
01:24:35,270 --> 01:24:39,001
我从后门出来，像这样捧着电视机
I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.

1108
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:43,090
一件大的老家伙，我都看不到了，然后我听到这个声音
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.

1109
01:24:43,728 --> 01:24:45,696
别动，举起手来！
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1110
01:24:46,547 --> 01:24:51,007
我站在那里，捧着电视机，他又说：
I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:

1111
01:24:51,217 --> 01:24:55,017
“你听到我说的吗？”，我说，“是的，先生”
"You hear what I said, boy?" I say, " Yes, sir. I did.

1112
01:24:55,222 --> 01:24:58,679
但我掉落东西，你会告我毁坏他人财物
But if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too."

1113
01:25:03,163 --> 01:25:05,460
你曾在卡士文服刑，是吗？
You done some stretch in Cashman, right?

1114
01:25:05,966 --> 01:25:09,924
是的，那儿要好过得多
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.

1115
01:25:10,204 --> 01:25:12,137
周末有休假，工作也很有计划
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

1116
01:25:12,338 --> 01:25:13,396
不像这里
Not like here.

1117
01:25:13,606 --> 01:25:16,040
看来你在新英格兰都呆在车里
Sounds like you done time all over.

1118
01:25:16,476 --> 01:25:18,877
我十三岁出道，哪里都去过
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1119
01:25:19,079 --> 01:25:21,030
说说看，也许我也去过那里
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1120
01:25:21,031 --> 01:25:23,693
也许你应转行了
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1121
01:25:25,135 --> 01:25:26,693
我是说
What I mean is...

1122
01:25:27,037 --> 01:25:30,473
……你不是个一流的小偷，你该试试别的
...you're not a very good thief. You should try something else.

1123
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:33,938
是吗？你以为你懂这个？
Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?

1124
01:25:34,243 --> 01:25:35,837
你怎会进来的？
What are you in for?

1125
01:25:36,114 --> 01:25:37,102
我吗？
Me?

1126
01:25:39,550 --> 01:25:41,211
律师坑了我
A lawyer fucked me.

1127
01:25:45,123 --> 01:25:48,092
这儿所有人都是无辜的，你不知道吗？
Everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?

1128
01:25:55,999 --> 01:26:00,403
后来知道，汤姆竟然有妻子和刚出生的女儿
As it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.

1129
01:26:00,871 --> 01:26:02,999
也许他想到她们在街上流荡
Maybe he thought of them on the streets...

1130
01:26:03,206 --> 01:26:05,697
孩子长大却不知道父亲是谁
... or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1131
01:26:06,009 --> 01:26:07,375
不管为什么，总之
Whatever it was...

1132
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:10,145
他竟努力起来了
... something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1133
01:26:13,984 --> 01:26:16,852
我想考取高校文凭
Thought I might try for my high school equivalency.

1134
01:26:17,054 --> 01:26:19,580
听说你已经帮了很多人了
Hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1135
01:26:20,925 --> 01:26:23,154
我不会在失败者身上浪费时间的
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1136
01:26:24,562 --> 01:26:27,053
我再也不是失败者了
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1137
01:26:28,800 --> 01:26:30,630
-你当真？ -是
- You mean that? - Yeah.

1138
01:26:32,303 --> 01:26:33,736
你真的是认真的？
You really mean that?

1139
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:36,136
是的，先生，绝对是真的
Yes, sir, I do.

1140
01:26:36,340 --> 01:26:38,308
好，因为我们要做就要……
Good. Because if we do this...

1141
01:26:38,509 --> 01:26:42,468
……有始有终，绝对不能半途而废
...we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1142
01:26:42,714 --> 01:26:44,510
问题是……
Thing is, see...

1143
01:26:45,782 --> 01:26:47,307
我识字不多
...I don't read so good.

1144
01:26:48,486 --> 01:26:49,577
好吧
"Well."

1145
01:26:51,589 --> 01:26:53,317
你不识字
You don't read...

1146
01:26:53,558 --> 01:26:55,081
就这样
...so well.

1147
01:26:57,428 --> 01:26:58,917
我们就由它开始
We'll get to that.

1148
01:27:03,367 --> 01:27:05,493
就这样，安迪开始给汤姆上课
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1149
01:27:05,702 --> 01:27:08,331
从最基础的字母开始教
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1150
01:27:10,474 --> 01:27:12,670
汤姆学得很快
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1151
01:27:12,943 --> 01:27:15,707
从不知道自己的聪明
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1152
01:27:18,049 --> 01:27:21,484
没过多久，安迪开始教他课程内容
Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.

1153
01:27:21,685 --> 01:27:23,346
他很喜欢这个孩子
He really liked the kid.

1154
01:27:23,554 --> 01:27:27,115
帮一个孩子上进让他很快乐
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.

1155
01:27:27,625 --> 01:27:29,889
但那不是唯一的原因
But that wasn't the only reason.

1156
01:27:30,594 --> 01:27:32,790
监狱里的日子很缓慢
Prison time is slow time.

1157
01:27:33,264 --> 01:27:35,858
要用某些事情来消磨时间
So you do what you can to keep going.

1158
01:27:36,200 --> 01:27:38,259
有人收集邮票
Some fellas collect stamps.

1159
01:27:38,669 --> 01:27:41,136
有人收集火柴盒
Others build matchstick houses.

1160
01:27:41,738 --> 01:27:44,401
安迪建起了图书馆
Andy built a library.

1161
01:27:44,908 --> 01:27:46,843
现在他需要新的计划
Now he needed a new project.

1162
01:27:47,710 --> 01:27:49,201
那就是汤姆
Tommy was it.

1163
01:27:49,846 --> 01:27:53,840
那和他多年来雕磨石头的原因一样
It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.

1164
01:27:54,384 --> 01:27:57,616
也如同他把美女的画像挂在墙上的原因
The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1165
01:27:58,523 --> 01:27:59,785
在监狱里
In prison...

1166
01:28:00,057 --> 01:28:03,787
一个人不能让心里空着
... a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.

1167
01:28:04,562 --> 01:28:09,430
在1966年，汤姆刚要参加考试的时候
By 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...

1168
01:28:09,666 --> 01:28:11,862
可爱的瑞奎尔（Raquel）出现了
... it was lovely Raquel.

1169
01:28:28,419 --> 01:28:29,407
时间到
Time.

1170
01:28:35,459 --> 01:28:36,447
好了吗？
Well?

1171
01:28:38,062 --> 01:28:40,188
真的是一团糟
Well, it's for shit.

1172
01:28:40,697 --> 01:28:43,531
我白花了一年时间在这狗屎上面
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.

1173
01:28:43,733 --> 01:28:45,224
也许没有你想的那么糟
It's probably not that bad.

1174
01:28:45,435 --> 01:28:49,667
比我想像中的还要糟，就像在考中文
I didn't get a thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.

1175
01:28:49,874 --> 01:28:51,603
看看你得了多少分？
Let's see how the score comes out.

1176
01:28:51,808 --> 01:28:54,777
我来告诉你吧
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.

1177
01:28:56,714 --> 01:28:58,078
两分
Two points, right there!

1178
01:28:58,282 --> 01:28:59,840
那就是你该死的考试
There's your goddamn score!

1179
01:29:00,084 --> 01:29:03,781
什么猫爬上树，5乘以5是25
Goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25...

1180
01:29:04,721 --> 01:29:06,349
去死吧
Fuck this place!

1181
01:29:06,590 --> 01:29:07,716
他妈的
Fuck it!

1182
01:29:26,877 --> 01:29:28,139
我感觉很差
I feel bad.

1183
01:29:28,345 --> 01:29:29,540
我令他失望了
I let him down.

1184
01:29:29,746 --> 01:29:31,475
不是这样，孩子
That's crap, kid.

1185
01:29:31,682 --> 01:29:33,013
他以你为荣
He's proud of you.

1186
01:29:33,350 --> 01:29:36,218
我跟他是老朋友，我很清楚他的性格
We're old friends, I know him as good as anybody.

1187
01:29:36,420 --> 01:29:37,978
聪明的伙伴，不是吗？
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1188
01:29:38,188 --> 01:29:41,317
就像刚进来时一样聪明，他以前是个银行家
Smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.

1189
01:29:41,524 --> 01:29:43,755
他为什么被抓进来？
What's he in here for anyway?

1190
01:29:44,094 --> 01:29:45,062
谋杀
Murder.

1191
01:29:46,529 --> 01:29:47,893
你说什么？
The hell, you say.

1192
01:29:50,033 --> 01:29:52,366
人不可以貌相
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1193
01:29:53,603 --> 01:29:57,700
在床上捉到妻子和一个高尔夫选手，把他们两个一起解决了
Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1194
01:30:05,384 --> 01:30:06,316
怎么了?
What?

1195
01:30:07,853 --> 01:30:09,912
大约四年前
About four years ago...

1196
01:30:10,689 --> 01:30:14,386
我在汤玛斯狱服刑
...I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1197
01:30:14,933 --> 01:30:16,229
我偷了一辆车
I stole a car.

1198
01:30:16,602 --> 01:30:18,593
这是很不应该的事
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1199
01:30:19,070 --> 01:30:21,300
在出狱前六个月
About six months left to go...

1200
01:30:21,607 --> 01:30:23,506
我有了个新同房
...I get a new cellmate in.

1201
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:25,836
艾马・布莱奇
Elmo Blatch.

1202
01:30:26,545 --> 01:30:27,876
一个强壮、暴躁的混蛋
Big, twitchy fucker.

1203
01:30:28,747 --> 01:30:32,238
人见人憎的那种，明白我的意思吗？
IKind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?

1204
01:30:32,451 --> 01:30:35,180
刑期是六到十二年，持械抢劫
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1205
01:30:35,453 --> 01:30:37,717
他说自己犯了不少案子
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1206
01:30:37,922 --> 01:30:42,859
难以相信，他很容易激动，你放个屁，他就暴跳如雷
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was. You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1207
01:30:43,929 --> 01:30:48,559
整天说个不停，从不闭嘴
Talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1208
01:30:48,766 --> 01:30:50,394
他谈他去过的地方
Places he'd been in...

1209
01:30:50,702 --> 01:30:53,760
他干过的案子，上过的女人
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1210
01:30:54,006 --> 01:30:56,201
和他杀的人
Even people he killed.

1211
01:30:57,443 --> 01:31:00,241
那些让他不爽的人
People who "gave him shit."

1212
01:31:00,878 --> 01:31:02,436
他是这么说的
That's how he put it.

1213
01:31:05,050 --> 01:31:07,108
有天晚上，我开玩笑的说
So one night, like a joke...

1214
01:31:08,220 --> 01:31:11,711
我问他，艾马，你杀了谁？
...I say to him, "Elmo, who did you kill?"

1215
01:31:11,957 --> 01:31:13,049
他说……
So he says:

1216
01:31:13,257 --> 01:31:17,216
有次我在乡村俱乐部打工
I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club...

1217
01:31:17,895 --> 01:31:21,797
看到来的人都非富则贵
...so I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.

1218
01:31:23,902 --> 01:31:25,893
所以我选了一个家伙
So I pick out this guy...

1219
01:31:26,805 --> 01:31:28,363
有天晚上到他家里去
...go in one night...

1220
01:31:28,573 --> 01:31:30,302
抢劫东西
...and do his place.

1221
01:31:31,742 --> 01:31:33,073
他醒过来
He wakes up...

1222
01:31:33,811 --> 01:31:35,574
令我很不爽
...and gives me shit.

1223
01:31:36,648 --> 01:31:38,309
所以我杀了他
So I killed him.

1224
01:31:40,085 --> 01:31:42,917
他和他的情妇
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1225
01:31:44,323 --> 01:31:46,586
那是最精彩的部分
And that's the best part.

1226
01:31:47,259 --> 01:31:49,726
她在和这个职业高尔夫球手做爱
She's fucking this prick, see...

1227
01:31:49,927 --> 01:31:52,988
但她是个有夫之妇
...this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.

1228
01:31:53,599 --> 01:31:56,158
她丈夫是个银行家
Some hotshot banker.

1229
01:31:57,603 --> 01:32:00,094
而他竟成了替罪羊
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1230
01:32:11,582 --> 01:32:15,451
这是我听过的最震惊的故事
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1231
01:32:16,721 --> 01:32:19,212
更让我吃惊的是，你竟然相信了它
What amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.

1232
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:20,925
先生？
Sir?

1233
01:32:23,162 --> 01:32:26,756
很明显威廉姆斯很喜欢你
It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.

1234
01:32:27,366 --> 01:32:31,301
他知道你的事后想让你振作起来
He hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1235
01:32:31,501 --> 01:32:33,663
他还年轻，不怎么明事理
He's young, not terribly bright.

1236
01:32:34,206 --> 01:32:37,641
他根本不明白这对你意味着什么，这并不奇怪
It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.

1237
01:32:38,042 --> 01:32:39,600
狱长，他讲的是事实
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1238
01:32:40,378 --> 01:32:44,542
就说这个，如果有布莱奇这个人的话
Let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.

1239
01:32:44,815 --> 01:32:49,445
你认为他会跪下来，哭着说“是我做的，我坦白”
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.

1240
01:32:49,654 --> 01:32:52,350
方便的话，给我加个终身监禁吧
By the way, add a life term to my sentence."

1241
01:32:52,558 --> 01:32:55,355
但是汤姆的证供能让我的案子重审
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1242
01:32:55,560 --> 01:32:58,028
前提是布莱奇在那狱中
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1243
01:32:58,262 --> 01:33:00,197
也许他现在已经获释了
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1244
01:33:00,399 --> 01:33:02,867
他们应该有他的住址的
They'd have his last known address.

1245
01:33:03,068 --> 01:33:05,001
这是个机会，对吗？
It's a chance, isn't it?

1246
01:33:07,338 --> 01:33:09,068
你怎会这么愚蠢？
How can you be so obtuse?

1247
01:33:10,007 --> 01:33:10,997
什么？
What?

1248
01:33:12,510 --> 01:33:13,978
你说什么？
What did you call me?

1249
01:33:14,179 --> 01:33:15,908
愚蠢，这是故意说的？
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1250
01:33:16,281 --> 01:33:17,770
你忘记你自己的身份了
You're forgetting yourself.

1251
01:33:18,116 --> 01:33:21,050
俱乐部会有他的工作记录卡的记录……
The country club will have his old timecards.

1252
01:33:21,251 --> 01:33:24,016
和有他名字的报税表
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1253
01:33:24,223 --> 01:33:26,918
你要继续幻想的话，那是你的事
If you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.

1254
01:33:27,125 --> 01:33:29,719
不要影响我，谈话结束
Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.

1255
01:33:29,927 --> 01:33:32,521
如果我能出去的话，我不会提起这里发生的一切
If I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.

1256
01:33:33,165 --> 01:33:36,134
我可以继续为你洗黑钱
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.

1257
01:33:38,001 --> 01:33:40,938
永远不许和我提钱的事，你这个婊子养的
Don't ever mention money to me, you son of a bitch!

1258
01:33:41,139 --> 01:33:42,800
不许在这间办公室
Not in this office...

1259
01:33:43,007 --> 01:33:44,442
不许在任何地方
...not anywhere. Get in here, now!

1260
01:33:44,469 --> 01:33:45,067
进来
I just wanted to put you at ease, that's all.

1261
01:33:45,176 --> 01:33:47,872
我只是想让你放心，没别的意恩

1262
01:33:48,512 --> 01:33:49,774
-禁闭室，一个月 -是，长官
Solitary. A month.

1263
01:33:50,782 --> 01:33:52,078
你怎么了？
What's wrong with you?

1264
01:33:52,283 --> 01:33:53,581
把他带出去
Get him out of here.

1265
01:33:53,784 --> 01:33:55,342
这是我出去的唯一的机会
This is my chance to get out!

1266
01:33:55,554 --> 01:33:57,350
这是我的人生！你明白吗？
It's my life! Understand?!

1267
01:33:57,555 --> 01:33:59,614
带他出去！带他出去！
Get him out!

1268
01:34:01,393 --> 01:34:03,360
关禁闭一个月
A month in the hole.

1269
01:34:03,561 --> 01:34:06,257
这是我听到过的最严厉的惩罚
That's the longest stretch I ever heard of.

1270
01:34:06,465 --> 01:34:07,760
这都是我的错
It's all my fault.

1271
01:34:07,966 --> 01:34:09,558
废话
Bullshit.

1272
01:34:10,234 --> 01:34:12,930
事情不是由你而起的，或让他入罪
You didn't pull the trigger or convict him.

1273
01:34:13,137 --> 01:34:15,537
你是说安迪是清白的？
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1274
01:34:15,741 --> 01:34:17,765
我是说，真真正正的无辜的？
I mean, for real innocent?

1275
01:34:17,975 --> 01:34:19,306
看起来是
It looks that way.

1276
01:34:19,744 --> 01:34:21,644
天啊
Sweet Jesus.

1277
01:34:21,912 --> 01:34:23,743
他到这里有多久了？
How long has he been here now?

1278
01:34:24,149 --> 01:34:27,413
1947，那是多少，19年
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

1279
01:34:27,653 --> 01:34:30,247
-汤姆・威廉姆斯 -是，在这
- Williams, Thomas. - Yeah, over here.

1280
01:34:36,094 --> 01:34:37,253
这是什么？
What you got?

1281
01:34:37,895 --> 01:34:39,226
校董会来的信
Board of Education.

1282
01:34:39,430 --> 01:34:40,954
他竟把它寄出去了
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1283
01:34:41,166 --> 01:34:45,125
你会打开它吗？还是打自己的屁股？
You going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?

1284
01:34:45,336 --> 01:34:47,497
打自己的屁股听起来好一点
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1285
01:34:48,006 --> 01:34:50,838
把它还给我，你他妈的
Skeets, come on. Give me that, you shithead.

1286
01:34:51,676 --> 01:34:53,007
别这样
Floyd, come on.

1287
01:34:58,449 --> 01:35:00,850
请你扔掉它，好吗？
Will you throw that away, please?

1288
01:35:06,457 --> 01:35:08,186
他妈的
Well, shit.

1289
01:35:20,872 --> 01:35:23,670
那孩子通过了，平均C+
The kid passed. C + average.

1290
01:35:23,875 --> 01:35:25,967
我想你会喜欢的
Thought you'd like to know.

1291
01:35:41,607 --> 01:35:43,075
典狱长要见你
Warden wants to talk.

1292
01:35:56,997 --> 01:35:58,055
就在这里？
Out here?

1293
01:35:58,265 --> 01:36:00,496
他是这么说的
That's what the man said.

1294
01:36:16,617 --> 01:36:17,605
典狱长？
Warden?

1295
01:36:18,657 --> 01:36:19,282
汤米

1296
01:36:27,627 --> 01:36:31,689
汤姆，我要你保证这次谈话只有我们两个知道
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.

1297
01:36:33,201 --> 01:36:35,465
我感到很艰难
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1298
01:36:53,921 --> 01:36:55,979
这事的情形很特别
We got a situation here.

1299
01:36:56,858 --> 01:36:58,951
我想你可以体会到
I think you can appreciate that.

1300
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:00,388
是的
Yes, sir.

1301
01:37:00,661 --> 01:37:02,059
我肯定
I sure can.

1302
01:37:02,330 --> 01:37:06,357
告诉你，孩子，这件事让我承受很大压力
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.

1303
01:37:07,835 --> 01:37:10,394
让我半夜惊醒，真的
It's got me up nights. That's the truth.

1304
01:37:12,672 --> 01:37:14,504
应该怎么做
The right thing to do...

1305
01:37:16,176 --> 01:37:19,907
有时很难让人明白
...sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1306
01:37:20,915 --> 01:37:22,348
你明白了吗？
Do you understand?

1307
01:37:24,652 --> 01:37:26,243
我需要你的帮助，孩子
I need your help, son.

1308
01:37:27,688 --> 01:37:29,849
如果我要继续追查下去
If I'm going to move on this...

1309
01:37:30,190 --> 01:37:33,354
就不能有丝毫的疑点
...there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1310
01:37:34,095 --> 01:37:35,153
我必须知道
I have to know...

1311
01:37:35,363 --> 01:37:39,191
你跟德弗瑞恩说的是事实吗？
...if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1312
01:37:39,532 --> 01:37:40,761
千真万确
Yes, sir.

1313
01:37:41,069 --> 01:37:43,260
那么你能在法官和陪审团面前……
Absolutely.

1314
01:37:41,339 --> 01:37:44,331
Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...

1315
01:37:44,471 --> 01:37:46,462
手放在圣经上……
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1316
01:37:46,674 --> 01:37:49,336
向上帝发誓吗？
...and take an oath before Almighty God himself?

1317
01:37:49,543 --> 01:37:51,340
只要你给我这个机会
Just give me that chance.

1318
01:37:55,616 --> 01:37:56,947
那也正是我认为的
That's what I thought.

1319
01:38:44,031 --> 01:38:45,930
我想你已经听说……
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1320
01:38:47,702 --> 01:38:48,724
那个坏消息了
Terrible thing.

1321
01:38:50,337 --> 01:38:51,805
一个这么年青的人
A man that young...

1322
01:38:52,139 --> 01:38:54,733
还有一年就要出狱了，还想逃狱
...less than a year to go, trying to escape.

1323
01:38:55,275 --> 01:38:57,766
哈德利队长被迫开枪
Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1324
01:38:58,513 --> 01:39:00,002
那是事实
Truly, it did.

1325
01:39:03,016 --> 01:39:05,451
我们不要再去提那件事了
We just have to put it behind us.

1326
01:39:07,121 --> 01:39:08,349
继续生活
Move on.

1327
01:39:09,956 --> 01:39:11,447
我已经完了
I'm done.

1328
01:39:12,760 --> 01:39:14,386
一切己结束了
Everything stops.

1329
01:39:16,363 --> 01:39:18,696
找其他人帮你做吧
Get someone else to run your scams.

1330
01:39:19,965 --> 01:39:21,797
任何事都没停下来
Nothing stops.

1331
01:39:23,136 --> 01:39:24,296
任何事
Nothing.

1332
01:39:27,707 --> 01:39:30,801
否则你在此继续熬下去
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1333
01:39:31,211 --> 01:39:33,510
再也没有警卫保护你
No more protection from the guards.

1334
01:39:33,747 --> 01:39:38,650
我会把你从单人牢房转到同性恋者那里
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.

1335
01:39:40,054 --> 01:39:42,488
你会觉得你被火车操了
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1336
01:39:43,890 --> 01:39:45,380
至于图书馆？
And the library?

1337
01:39:45,859 --> 01:39:46,849
不存在了
Gone.

1338
01:39:47,868 --> 01:39:49,585
我们用书在院子里烤肉
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1339
01:39:50,062 --> 01:39:52,094
会被一块块的砖头封闭起来
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1340
01:39:52,894 --> 01:39:55,020
几英里以外都能看见火焰
They'll see the flames for miles.

1341
01:39:55,229 --> 01:39:58,061
我们像土著人那样围着书跳舞
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1342
01:39:59,809 --> 01:40:02,801
你明白我的意思了吗？听懂了吗？
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1343
01:40:06,550 --> 01:40:08,415
或许我很愚蠢？
Or am I being obtuse?

1344
01:40:20,197 --> 01:40:22,825
再给他一个月时间考虑清楚
Give him another month to think about it.

1345
01:41:09,780 --> 01:41:12,839
我妻子曾说过我是个很难理解的人
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1346
01:41:13,651 --> 01:41:15,482
像本合着的书
Like a closed book.

1347
01:41:16,285 --> 01:41:18,312
她经常这样抱怨
Complained about it all the time.

1348
01:41:19,255 --> 01:41:20,813
她很漂亮
She was beautiful.

1349
01:41:23,227 --> 01:41:24,750
上帝，我爱她
God, I loved her.

1350
01:41:28,464 --> 01:41:30,695
只是我不知道如何表达我的感情
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1351
01:41:33,437 --> 01:41:35,098
我杀了她，瑞德
I killed her, Red.

1352
01:41:36,973 --> 01:41:38,771
虽然不是我开的枪
I didn't pull the trigger...

1353
01:41:40,209 --> 01:41:41,938
但是我把她赶走的
...but I drove her away.

1354
01:41:43,446 --> 01:41:46,142
她是因我而死的
That's why she died, because of me...

1355
01:41:46,349 --> 01:41:47,714
因为我对她的态度
...the way I am.

1356
01:41:56,727 --> 01:41:58,558
那不能判你谋杀的
That don't make you a murderer.

1357
01:42:01,932 --> 01:42:03,695
只能说是坏丈夫
Bad husband, maybe.

1358
01:42:07,338 --> 01:42:10,602
你可以为此难过，但枪不是你开的
Feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.

1359
01:42:10,808 --> 01:42:12,138
不是我杀的
No, I didn't.

1360
01:42:12,543 --> 01:42:14,477
是别人干的
Somebody else did.

1361
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,805
我在这里做了替死鬼
And I wound up in here.

1362
01:42:20,284 --> 01:42:21,875
运气不好，我想
Bad luck, I guess.

1363
01:42:27,090 --> 01:42:28,523
霉运到处漂浮
It floats around.

1364
01:42:29,559 --> 01:42:31,790
总要有人承受的
It's got to land on somebody.

1365
01:42:32,696 --> 01:42:34,595
刚巧轮到我罢了
It was my turn, that's all.

1366
01:42:35,299 --> 01:42:38,062
我刚好碰上了它
I was in the path of the tornado.

1367
01:42:44,007 --> 01:42:47,965
我只是没有想到会这么久
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.

1368
01:42:52,316 --> 01:42:54,010
想过你有一天能出去吗？
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1369
01:42:55,251 --> 01:42:56,276
我？
Me?

1370
01:42:59,255 --> 01:43:00,245
有
Yeah.

1371
01:43:01,592 --> 01:43:03,889
有一天，到我头发花白……
One day, when I got a long, white beard...

1372
01:43:04,093 --> 01:43:07,257
头昏眼花的时候
...and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.

1373
01:43:09,299 --> 01:43:10,925
我告诉你，我会到哪里去
I tell you where I'd go.

1374
01:43:12,402 --> 01:43:14,063
圣哈塔尼奥
Zihuatanejo.

1375
01:43:14,937 --> 01:43:16,132
什么？
Say what?

1376
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,271
圣哈塔尼奥
Zihuatanejo.

1377
01:43:19,209 --> 01:43:20,870
在墨西哥
It's in Mexico.

1378
01:43:22,245 --> 01:43:24,373
太平洋中的一个小地方
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1379
01:43:25,516 --> 01:43:28,313
你知道墨西哥人怎么形容太平洋的
You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?

1380
01:43:30,120 --> 01:43:32,111
他们说那里是没有记忆的地方
They say it has no memory.

1381
01:43:34,090 --> 01:43:36,753
那就是我想渡过余生的地方
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1382
01:43:38,394 --> 01:43:40,885
一个没有记忆的温暖地方
A warm place with no memory.

1383
01:43:44,133 --> 01:43:46,067
开间小旅馆
Open up a little hotel...

1384
01:43:47,771 --> 01:43:49,260
就在沙滩边上
...right on the beach.

1385
01:43:49,873 --> 01:43:52,067
买艘不值钱的旧船回来
Buy some worthless old boat...

1386
01:43:52,608 --> 01:43:54,236
把它翻新
...and fix it up new.

1387
01:43:56,979 --> 01:43:58,208
载着我的客人
Take my guests out...

1388
01:43:59,049 --> 01:44:00,414
出海钓鱼
...charter fishing.

1389
01:44:04,254 --> 01:44:05,982
圣哈塔尼奥
Zihuatanejo.

1390
01:44:09,526 --> 01:44:13,393
在那种地方，我需要个能找到东西的人
In a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.

1391
01:44:19,937 --> 01:44:22,769
我觉得外面的社会可能不适合我
I don't think I could make it on the outside.

1392
01:44:29,446 --> 01:44:31,504
我的大半生都在这里渡过
I been in here most of my life.

1393
01:44:32,950 --> 01:44:34,713
我已经是这里的一部分了
I'm an institutional man now.

1394
01:44:35,619 --> 01:44:37,348
就像布鲁克那样
Just like Brooks was.

1395
01:44:38,821 --> 01:44:40,517
你看轻了你自己
You underestimate yourself.

1396
01:44:41,090 --> 01:44:42,683
我不这样看
I don't think so.

1397
01:44:46,530 --> 01:44:50,465
在此我能供应物品给你，但是……
In here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but...

1398
01:44:51,235 --> 01:44:53,759
在外面你只需要电话簿黄页分类
...outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1399
01:44:53,970 --> 01:44:56,200
我不知道如何开始
Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.

1400
01:44:58,342 --> 01:44:59,968
太平洋？
Pacific Ocean?

1401
01:45:00,376 --> 01:45:01,604

Shit.

1402
01:45:01,977 --> 01:45:04,174
那么大的地方会吓死我的
Scare me to death, something that big.

1403
01:45:04,380 --> 01:45:05,678
我不怕
Not me.

1404
01:45:06,883 --> 01:45:09,647
我没开枪杀我妻子，我也没开枪杀她的情人
I didn't shoot my wife, and I didn't shoot her lover.

1405
01:45:11,388 --> 01:45:14,619
不论我犯了什么错，我都已补偿了
Whatever mistakes I made, I've paid for them and then some.

1406
01:45:15,659 --> 01:45:17,148
一间旅馆和一条船
That hotel, that boat...

1407
01:45:18,928 --> 01:45:21,159
我要的并不太多
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1408
01:45:26,068 --> 01:45:28,503
我劝你不要再想了
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1409
01:45:28,705 --> 01:45:30,729
那只是你的梦想罢了
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1410
01:45:31,174 --> 01:45:33,642
墨西哥在遥远的天边，而你在这里
Mexico is way down there and you're in here...

1411
01:45:33,843 --> 01:45:35,401
这才是现实
...and that's the way it is.

1412
01:45:35,745 --> 01:45:38,579
是的，是这样
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1413
01:45:40,083 --> 01:45:42,482
它在远方，而我在这里
It's down there and I'm in here.

1414
01:45:45,054 --> 01:45:47,785
我想只有一个简单的选择
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.

1415
01:45:50,693 --> 01:45:52,183
要么忙着活……
Get busy living...

1416
01:45:53,563 --> 01:45:55,589
要么忙着死
...or get busy dying.

1417
01:45:59,370 --> 01:46:00,166
安迪

1418
01:46:04,208 --> 01:46:05,072
瑞德

1419
01:46:07,710 --> 01:46:10,441
如果你能出去的话，帮我做件事
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1420
01:46:10,647 --> 01:46:12,910
当然可以，安迪，什么事都行
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1421
01:46:14,785 --> 01:46:18,652
布克斯顿附近有个草场，你知道在哪里吗？
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?

1422
01:46:20,123 --> 01:46:23,250
-那里有许多牧场 -有一个很特别……
- A lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular.

1423
01:46:23,459 --> 01:46:27,396
它有很长的石墙，北边的尽头有棵橡树
It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.

1424
01:46:27,598 --> 01:46:30,464
像佛洛斯特的诗描绘的那样 「佛洛斯特（Robert Frost）：美国著名诗人」
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1425
01:46:31,401 --> 01:46:33,892
那是我向我太太求婚的地方
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1426
01:46:35,304 --> 01:46:37,397
我们到那里去野餐
We went there for a picnic...

1427
01:46:37,808 --> 01:46:39,901
还在橡树下做爱
...and made love under that oak...

1428
01:46:40,576 --> 01:46:42,807
我向她求婚，她答应了
...and I asked and she said yes.

1429
01:46:46,817 --> 01:46:48,647
答应我，瑞德
Promise me, Red.

1430
01:46:49,486 --> 01:46:51,112
如果你出去的话
If you ever get out...

1431
01:46:51,321 --> 01:46:52,811
找到那里
...find that spot.

1432
01:46:53,991 --> 01:46:58,825
在墙角下，有块与众不同的石头……
At the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.

1433
01:46:59,963 --> 01:47:02,988
一块黑色的火山玻璃石
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1434
01:47:05,669 --> 01:47:08,330
下面埋着我想给你的东西
Something's buried under it I want you to have.

1435
01:47:09,106 --> 01:47:10,334
是什么，安迪？
What, Andy?

1436
01:47:10,773 --> 01:47:12,503
埋在那里的是什么？
What's buried under there?

1437
01:47:14,111 --> 01:47:15,976
你自己挖出来……
You'll have to pry it up...

1438
01:47:16,178 --> 01:47:17,441
……就知道了
...to see.

1439
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:25,287
不，我告诉你，他……
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1440
01:47:25,955 --> 01:47:27,684
他只是在开玩笑
He's talking funny.

1441
01:47:28,791 --> 01:47:30,486
我真的很担心他
I'm really worried about him.

1442
01:47:30,893 --> 01:47:32,326
那就好好看着他吧
Let's keep an eye on him.

1443
01:47:32,528 --> 01:47:35,794
白天还可以，但晚上怎么办？
That's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.

1444
01:47:37,233 --> 01:47:38,360
上帝
Oh, Lord.

1445
01:47:39,702 --> 01:47:40,532
什么事？
What?

1446
01:47:42,039 --> 01:47:44,803
安迪今天到我这里来过
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1447
01:47:45,008 --> 01:47:47,101
他问我要了捆绳索
He asked me for a length of rope.

1448
01:47:47,309 --> 01:47:48,139
绳索？
Rope?

1449
01:47:48,343 --> 01:47:50,005
六英尺长
Six feet long.

1450
01:47:50,246 --> 01:47:51,611
那你给他了？
And you gave it to him.

1451
01:47:52,482 --> 01:47:54,278
当然为什么不呢？
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

1452
01:47:54,483 --> 01:47:56,041
上帝！海伍德
Jesus! Heywood.

1453
01:47:56,652 --> 01:47:58,620
我怎么知道？
How was I supposed to know?

1454
01:47:58,821 --> 01:48:00,379
还记得布鲁克斯吗？
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1455
01:48:02,392 --> 01:48:04,325
不，安迪不会那样做的
Andy would never do that.

1456
01:48:04,928 --> 01:48:05,986
永远不会
Never.

1457
01:48:08,065 --> 01:48:09,396
我不敢肯定
I don't know.

1458
01:48:12,235 --> 01:48:14,259
人总有脆弱的一刻
Every man has his breaking point.

1459
01:48:16,606 --> 01:48:18,870
快点要收工了
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

1460
01:48:19,175 --> 01:48:20,938
还差一点点了
Just about finished, sir.

1461
01:48:38,061 --> 01:48:39,687
今晚有三笔存款
Three deposits tonight.

1462
01:48:47,670 --> 01:48:49,571
把我的衣服拿到洗衣处去
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1463
01:48:49,772 --> 01:48:51,400
还要擦一下我的鞋子
And shine my shoes.

1464
01:48:51,607 --> 01:48:54,543
我要它们看起来像镜子一样亮，好的，先生
- I want them looking like mirrors. - Yes, sir.

1465
01:49:00,049 --> 01:49:01,517
你能回来真好，安迪
It's good having you back.

1466
01:49:02,451 --> 01:49:04,317
你不在的话，一切都不一样了
Place wasn't the same without you.

1467
01:49:51,200 --> 01:49:52,258
熄灯
Lights out!

1468
01:50:25,101 --> 01:50:27,625
那是个辗转难眠的长夜
I've had some long nights in stir.

1469
01:50:28,170 --> 01:50:30,833
孤独的黑暗中只有思想
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts...

1470
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:33,702
时间像把快刀
... time can draw out like a blade.

1471
01:50:39,049 --> 01:50:42,040
那是我一生中最漫长的夜晚
That was the longest night of my life.

1472
01:50:57,901 --> 01:50:59,061
清点人数
Give me a count!

1473
01:51:03,572 --> 01:51:06,406
南边三楼，人齐了
Tier 3 south, clear!

1474
01:51:09,545 --> 01:51:12,709
二楼245囚室的人不见了
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1475
01:51:12,915 --> 01:51:13,973
德弗瑞恩！
Dufresne!

1476
01:51:14,517 --> 01:51:16,950
快出来！不要耍花样
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1477
01:51:20,089 --> 01:51:23,491
别要我下来打爆你的头
Don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!

1478
01:51:31,067 --> 01:51:34,901
他妈的，你不要耽误我，我还有很多事要做
Damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.

1479
01:51:35,104 --> 01:51:38,403
你最好是病了或者死了
You'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!

1480
01:51:38,607 --> 01:51:39,938
你听到了吗？
You hear me?

1481
01:51:46,049 --> 01:51:48,142
啊，我的上帝！
Oh, my Holy God.

1482
01:52:05,134 --> 01:52:07,695
查问这里的每一个犯人
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.

1483
01:52:08,138 --> 01:52:10,697
-从他的好朋友开始 -谁？
- Start with that friend of his. - Who?

1484
01:52:11,138 --> 01:52:12,697
他！

1485
01:52:13,276 --> 01:52:14,834
打开237号的门
Open 237.

1486
01:52:18,348 --> 01:52:22,010
你什么意思，“他不在这了”？别跟我说这种话
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.

1487
01:52:22,885 --> 01:52:24,217
别再这样说
Don't tell me that again.

1488
01:52:24,420 --> 01:52:25,445
但是长官，他真的不在那里
But sir, he wasn't.

1489
01:52:25,688 --> 01:52:29,147
我看得见！你认为我瞎了吗？
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?

1490
01:52:29,825 --> 01:52:31,224
这就是你想说的吗？
Is that what you're saying?

1491
01:52:31,428 --> 01:52:34,089
-我瞎了吗？ -没有！长官
- Am I blind, Haig? - No, sir!

1492
01:52:34,998 --> 01:52:37,488
那你呢？你瞎了吗？
What about you. You blind?

1493
01:52:38,000 --> 01:52:40,561
-告诉我这是什么？ -昨晚的查房记录
- Tell me what this is. - Last night's count.

1494
01:52:40,769 --> 01:52:44,068
你看到德弗瑞恩的名字吗？我确定，就在那里
You see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.

1495
01:52:44,273 --> 01:52:45,604
“德弗瑞恩”
"Dufresne."

1496
01:52:47,276 --> 01:52:48,744
他熄灯的时候
He was in his cell...

1497
01:52:48,977 --> 01:52:49,946
还在囚室里的
...at lights out.

1498
01:52:50,146 --> 01:52:52,410
因此今早他也应该在
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

1499
01:52:53,450 --> 01:52:55,076
我要找到他
I want him found.

1500
01:52:55,285 --> 01:52:58,742
不是明天，不是早饭后，是现在
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1501
01:52:58,988 --> 01:53:00,183
是的，长官
Yes, sir.

1502
01:53:01,191 --> 01:53:03,455
快走
Let's go. Move your butts.

1503
01:53:06,862 --> 01:53:07,852
站好
Stand.

1504
01:53:09,299 --> 01:53:10,357
那么？
Well?

1505
01:53:13,803 --> 01:53:14,791
那么，什么？
Well, what?

1506
01:53:15,004 --> 01:53:18,463
你们常在一起，亲密得像做贼一样
I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.

1507
01:53:19,541 --> 01:53:21,031
他肯定对你说过些什么
He must have said something.

1508
01:53:21,777 --> 01:53:23,302
没有，先生，狱长
No, sir, Warden.

1509
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:24,647
什么都没说
Not a word.

1510
01:53:26,482 --> 01:53:29,043
主啊，这是个奇迹
Lord, it's a miracle!

1511
01:53:29,651 --> 01:53:32,211
人就像屁一样在风中消失了
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1512
01:53:32,888 --> 01:53:34,049
什么都没留下
Nothing left...

1513
01:53:34,891 --> 01:53:37,620
只剩下窗台上的石头
...but some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1514
01:53:37,826 --> 01:53:40,557
和那墙上的小妞，问问她吧
And that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.

1515
01:53:40,763 --> 01:53:42,526
也许她知道些什么
Maybe she knows.

1516
01:53:42,766 --> 01:53:45,495
你想说什么？
What say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?

1517
01:53:46,936 --> 01:53:48,232
我想没有
Guess not.

1518
01:53:48,804 --> 01:53:51,000
为什么她有点特别？
Why should she be any different?

1519
01:53:52,075 --> 01:53:53,736
这是一个阴谋
This is a conspiracy.

1520
01:53:54,376 --> 01:53:56,208
肯定是的
That's what this is.

1521
01:53:56,812 --> 01:54:00,544
一个该死的大阴谋
One big, damn conspiracy!

1522
01:54:00,817 --> 01:54:02,808
所有人都有参与
And everyone's in on it!

1523
01:54:03,452 --> 01:54:04,612
包括她
Including her!

1524
01:54:39,656 --> 01:54:41,351
在1966年
In 1966...

1525
01:54:41,558 --> 01:54:43,958
安迪・德弗瑞恩从肖申克监狱……
... Andy Dufresne escaped...

1526
01:54:44,160 --> 01:54:45,718
逃了出去
... from Shawshank Prison.

1527
01:54:47,964 --> 01:54:50,523
他们只能找到泥塘中的囚衣……
All they found was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1528
01:54:51,166 --> 01:54:52,691
一块肥皂……
... a bar of soap...

1529
01:54:52,901 --> 01:54:54,459
和一个很旧的手槌
... and an old rock hammer...

1530
01:54:54,670 --> 01:54:57,138
几乎快被削成一小块
... damn near worn down to the nub.

1531
01:55:01,643 --> 01:55:06,410
我曾认为用手槌要六百年才能掘通的隧道
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1532
01:55:07,049 --> 01:55:09,678
安迪用不到二十年就办到了
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1533
01:55:27,970 --> 01:55:30,268
安迪很喜欢地质学
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1534
01:55:31,040 --> 01:55:34,202
我能想像这归功于他一丝不苟的本性
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1535
01:55:34,611 --> 01:55:36,442
如果这里有一段冰河时期
An ice age here...

1536
01:55:36,879 --> 01:55:39,370
百万年后，山脉就会在那里形成
... million years of mountain building there.

1537
01:55:40,383 --> 01:55:43,215
地质学是关于压力和时间的研究
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1538
01:55:44,053 --> 01:55:46,044
需要的仅仅就是这些
That's all it takes, really.

1539
01:55:46,789 --> 01:55:47,880
压力……
Pressure...

1540
01:55:48,525 --> 01:55:49,785
……和时间
... and time.

1541
01:55:51,126 --> 01:55:53,186
还有一张大海报
That and a big goddamn poster.

1542
01:55:57,232 --> 01:55:58,165
就像我说的那样
Like I said...

1543
01:55:58,668 --> 01:56:02,660
监狱里的人都会找事情来消磨时间
... in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.

1544
01:56:05,474 --> 01:56:10,276
看起来安迪的爱好是把他的墙搬运到广场上
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard...

1545
01:56:10,812 --> 01:56:12,746
每次一把
... a handful at a time.

1546
01:56:14,049 --> 01:56:16,108
我猜在汤姆被杀后
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1547
01:56:16,318 --> 01:56:19,287
安迪觉得他在此呆得已够久了
... Andy decided he'd been here long enough.

1548
01:56:19,488 --> 01:56:22,049
尽快，我要回家了
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1549
01:56:22,791 --> 01:56:24,817
我马上就好了
I'm just about finished, sir.

1550
01:56:46,281 --> 01:56:48,215
今晚有三笔存款
Three deposits tonight.

1551
01:56:55,525 --> 01:56:57,822
安迪照他的吩咐
Andy did like he was told.

1552
01:56:58,026 --> 01:57:01,518
把鞋擦得闪闪发亮
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.

1553
01:57:05,200 --> 01:57:07,499
警卫完全没有注意到
The guards simply didn't notice.

1554
01:57:07,803 --> 01:57:09,271
我也没有
Neither did I.

1555
01:57:09,472 --> 01:57:10,995
说真的
I mean, seriously...

1556
01:57:11,206 --> 01:57:14,199
谁会留意别人穿的鞋子呢？
... how often do you really look at a man's shoes?

1557
01:59:17,767 --> 01:59:20,929
安迪朝向自由爬了五百码
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...

1558
01:59:21,169 --> 01:59:24,503
我难以想像有多臭的下水道
... of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1559
01:59:25,508 --> 01:59:27,839
或许我只是不想去爬
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1560
01:59:32,248 --> 01:59:34,613
五百码
Five hundred yards.

1561
01:59:35,117 --> 01:59:38,178
有五个足球场那么长
That's the length of five football fields.

1562
01:59:38,821 --> 01:59:41,380
有半英里左右
Just shy of half a mile.

1563
02:00:36,611 --> 02:00:41,208
第二天早上，就在那海报被撕下来的时候
The next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret...

1564
02:00:41,517 --> 02:00:44,349
一个从未出现过的人
... a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...

1565
02:00:44,586 --> 02:00:47,180
走进了缅因州国家银行
... strolled into the Maine National Bank.

1566
02:00:47,757 --> 02:00:50,919
在那一刻前，他从来是不存在的
Until that moment, he didn't exist.

1567
02:00:51,494 --> 02:00:53,860
-除了在纸上 -我可以帮忙吗？
- Except on paper. - May I help you?

1568
02:00:54,263 --> 02:00:56,196
他有所有正确的身份证明文件……
He had all the proper ID...

1569
02:00:56,398 --> 02:01:00,095
驾驶执照、出生证明、社会安全证……
... driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card...

1570
02:01:00,535 --> 02:01:03,061
签名也是正确的
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1571
02:01:03,272 --> 02:01:06,366
不能再为你服务真的很遗憾
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1572
02:01:06,575 --> 02:01:08,304
希望你在国外生活愉快
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1573
02:01:09,111 --> 02:01:10,202
谢谢
Thank you.

1574
02:01:10,879 --> 02:01:12,040
我想我会的
I'm sure I will.

1575
02:01:12,949 --> 02:01:16,281
先生，这是你的本票，还有别的吗？
Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?

1576
02:01:16,486 --> 02:01:17,474
请问
Please.

1577
02:01:18,053 --> 02:01:20,544
你能帮我把它寄出吗？
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1578
02:01:21,057 --> 02:01:22,250
我很乐意
I'd be happy to.

1579
02:01:24,059 --> 02:01:25,391
-再见 -走好，先生
Good day, sir.

1580
02:01:26,329 --> 02:01:30,766
史蒂文先生那天早上去了将近十二家银行
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.

1581
02:01:31,233 --> 02:01:32,825
加起来
All told, he blew town...

1582
02:01:33,035 --> 02:01:37,870
他总共提取了三十七万诺顿狱长的钱
... with better than $370,000 of Warden Norton's money.

1583
02:01:38,574 --> 02:01:41,338
作为十九年的赔偿
Severance pay for 19 years.

1584
02:01:48,584 --> 02:01:50,778
早上好，波特兰时报
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1585
02:01:51,255 --> 02:01:53,985
“肖申克监狱,贪污谋杀”

1586
02:02:01,899 --> 02:02:04,265
“主的审判迅速降临”

1587
02:02:20,884 --> 02:02:23,717
“亲爱的典狱长,你说的对”

1588
02:02:23,754 --> 02:02:25,551
“得救之道,就在其中”

1589
02:02:42,938 --> 02:02:45,874
拜伦・哈德利？你有权保持沉默
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.

1590
02:02:46,142 --> 02:02:50,478
否则你所说的一切都将对你不利
If you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.

1591
02:02:51,714 --> 02:02:55,174
我虽没有亲眼看到，但我听说他被带走时
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1592
02:02:55,384 --> 02:02:56,875
哭得像个娘们
... when they took him away.

1593
02:03:03,158 --> 02:03:06,160
诺顿没有静静离开的意思
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1594
02:03:23,012 --> 02:03:23,842
森姆・诺顿？
Samuel Norton.

1595
02:03:24,647 --> 02:03:27,080
我们有拘捕令，开门！
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

1596
02:03:31,821 --> 02:03:32,912
开门吧
Open the door.

1597
02:03:33,455 --> 02:03:34,718
我不知是哪把钥匙
I'm not sure which key.

1598
02:03:44,866 --> 02:03:46,800
别紧张，诺顿
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1599
02:03:58,313 --> 02:04:01,772
我想知道当子弹穿过他的头的时候
I like to think the last thing that went through his head...

1600
02:04:01,983 --> 02:04:03,575
他在想些什么
... other than that bullet...

1601
02:04:03,785 --> 02:04:08,223
是在想该死的安迪.德弗瑞恩到底是如何击败他？
... was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1602
02:04:10,726 --> 02:04:14,183
诺顿狱长一伙倒台之后
Not long after the warden deprived us of his company...

1603
02:04:14,463 --> 02:04:16,522
我收到了张明信片
... I got a postcard in the mail.

1604
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:20,833
它是空白的，但是邮戳是……
It was blank, but the postmark said...

1605
02:04:21,035 --> 02:04:23,164
汉格堡，德萨斯州的
... Fort Hancock, Texas.

1606
02:04:23,405 --> 02:04:24,771
汉格堡
Fort Hancock...

1607
02:04:25,040 --> 02:04:26,770
就在边境那里
... right on the border.

1608
02:04:27,176 --> 02:04:29,167
安迪就是从那里出国的
That's where Andy crossed.

1609
02:04:29,745 --> 02:04:33,875
当我想到他开车向南走的时候
When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...

1610
02:04:34,217 --> 02:04:36,446
我总会笑起来
... it always makes me laugh.

1611
02:04:38,286 --> 02:04:39,844
安迪・德弗瑞恩
Andy Dufresne...

1612
02:04:40,222 --> 02:04:42,248
爬过了那臭屎沟
... who crawled through a river of shit...

1613
02:04:42,458 --> 02:04:44,857
然后干干净净的到另一边去了
... and came out clean on the other side.

1614
02:04:45,695 --> 02:04:47,060
安迪・德弗瑞恩
Andy Dufresne...

1615
02:04:47,864 --> 02:04:49,455
向太平洋进发
... headed for the Pacific.

1616
02:04:52,435 --> 02:04:54,596
哈德利抓住他的头，对吗？
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?

1617
02:04:54,802 --> 02:04:58,603
他说，“我相信他将会发生意外”
He says, " I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."

1618
02:04:58,807 --> 02:05:01,674
我们跟他熟的老是谈起安迪
Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.

1619
02:05:02,344 --> 02:05:04,039
我发誓，他总是带来话题
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1620
02:05:04,246 --> 02:05:07,216
“我的朋友可以要两瓶啤酒”
"My friends could use a couple of beers."

1621
02:05:07,549 --> 02:05:09,210
他成功了
And he got it!

1622
02:05:10,453 --> 02:05:12,852
有时那令我伤心，虽然……
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1623
02:05:13,121 --> 02:05:14,554
安迪已经离开了
... Andy being gone.

1624
02:05:15,258 --> 02:05:19,387
我不得不提醒自己有些鸟是不能关在笼子里的
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1625
02:05:19,860 --> 02:05:21,920
它们的羽毛太光亮
Their feathers are just too bright.

1626
02:05:23,633 --> 02:05:25,360
当它们飞走的时候
And when they fly away...

1627
02:05:25,802 --> 02:05:30,204
你会觉得把它们关起来是种罪恶
... the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1628
02:05:31,274 --> 02:05:32,535
但是
But still...

1629
02:05:33,008 --> 02:05:37,342
它们的离开让你生活的地方空荡荡的
... the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.

1630
02:05:41,551 --> 02:05:43,917
可能我只是想念我的朋友了
I guess I just miss my friend.

1631
02:06:08,610 --> 02:06:09,543
请坐
Please sit down.

1632
02:06:15,383 --> 02:06:16,941
瑞德
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1633
02:06:17,485 --> 02:06:20,752
你因终身监禁已被关了40年了
...your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.

1634
02:06:21,557 --> 02:06:23,683
你觉得你已改过了吗？
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1635
02:06:25,561 --> 02:06:27,119
改过？
Rehabilitated?

1636
02:06:29,164 --> 02:06:31,065
让我想想
Well, now, let me see.

1637
02:06:32,067 --> 02:06:34,400
我不明白那是什么意思
I don't have any idea what that means.

1638
02:06:36,505 --> 02:06:38,770
你有心理准备重新投入社会吗？
It means you're ready to rejoin society...

1639
02:06:39,342 --> 02:06:41,673
我知道你们是怎么想的，老弟
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1640
02:06:43,846 --> 02:06:45,837
对我来说那只是个用来掩饰的词
To me it's just a made-up word.

1641
02:06:47,182 --> 02:06:49,515
政客用的词语
A politician's word so that...

1642
02:06:49,951 --> 02:06:53,478
让你们年青人能穿西装打领带
...young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie...

1643
02:06:53,955 --> 02:06:55,548
有一份好工作
...and have a job.

1644
02:06:57,526 --> 02:06:59,619
你倒底想知道些什么？
What do you really want to know?

1645
02:07:00,396 --> 02:07:02,364
我对自己所犯的罪感到后悔吗？
Am I sorry for what I did?

1646
02:07:02,598 --> 02:07:03,758
你有后悔吗？
Well, are you?

1647
02:07:05,668 --> 02:07:08,500
没有一天我不感到后悔的
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1648
02:07:09,871 --> 02:07:13,330
不是因为我在监狱里，或者你认为我该这样
Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.

1649
02:07:16,812 --> 02:07:19,373
我回首过往
I look back on the way I was then...

1650
02:07:21,517 --> 02:07:22,677
一个年青的……
...a young...

1651
02:07:23,785 --> 02:07:27,277
愚蠢的孩子犯了大罪
...stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1652
02:07:30,293 --> 02:07:31,987
我想和他谈谈
I want to talk to him.

1653
02:07:33,929 --> 02:07:36,397
我想和他讲讲道理
I want to try and talk some sense to him.

1654
02:07:37,133 --> 02:07:39,067
告诉他做人道理
Tell him the way things are.

1655
02:07:41,169 --> 02:07:42,602
但已经不能了
But I can't.

1656
02:07:44,807 --> 02:07:46,798
那孩子已无影无踪
That kid's long gone...

1657
02:07:48,009 --> 02:07:50,773
只剩下这个老人
...and this old man is all that's left.

1658
02:07:52,180 --> 02:07:53,647
我得这样生活下去
I got to live with that.

1659
02:07:55,017 --> 02:07:56,711
改过？
Rehabilitated?

1660
02:07:57,085 --> 02:07:58,916
只是个狗屁的字眼
It's just a bullshit word.

1661
02:07:59,856 --> 02:08:04,623
你继续盖上你的印章吧，老弟，别再浪费我的时间了
So you go on and stamp your forms, sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1662
02:08:05,861 --> 02:08:08,125
说句实话
Because to tell you the truth...

1663
02:08:08,464 --> 02:08:10,455
我根本不在乎
...I don't give a shit.

1664
02:08:23,564 --> 02:08:24,855
“通过”

1665
02:09:20,586 --> 02:09:22,551
“布鲁斯到此”

1666
02:09:36,986 --> 02:09:38,384
你的，小姐
Here you go, miss.

1667
02:09:41,324 --> 02:09:42,348
我可以去洗手间吗？
Restroom break?

1668
02:09:48,164 --> 02:09:52,692
你不用每次都问我，去吧
You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1669
02:10:05,748 --> 02:10:08,808
四十年来我小便都要经过批准
Forty years I've been asking permission to piss.

1670
02:10:09,651 --> 02:10:12,643
不批准的话一滴都尿不出来
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1671
02:10:16,157 --> 02:10:18,318
现实是很难面对的
There's a harsh truth to face.

1672
02:10:19,995 --> 02:10:22,897
我不习惯外面的生活
No way I'm going to make it on the outside.

1673
02:10:30,772 --> 02:10:34,468
我总在想怎样才能违反假释条例
All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole...

1674
02:10:35,277 --> 02:10:37,745
那样他们会把我再送进去
... so maybe they'd send me back.

1675
02:10:42,951 --> 02:10:45,385
生活在恐惧中是很可怕的
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1676
02:10:46,289 --> 02:10:47,950
布鲁克是知道的
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1677
02:10:48,156 --> 02:10:50,090
他知道得太清楚了
Knew it all too well.

1678
02:10:51,693 --> 02:10:55,093
我只想回到能适合我的地方
All I want is to be back where things make sense.

1679
02:10:55,531 --> 02:10:58,260
令我不用再担心受怕的地方
Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1680
02:11:00,268 --> 02:11:02,634
只有一件事阻止了我这么做
Only one thing stops me.

1681
02:11:04,072 --> 02:11:06,473
我对安迪作出的承诺
A promise I made to Andy.

1682
02:11:26,995 --> 02:11:28,121
就在那里
There it is.

1683
02:11:38,741 --> 02:11:40,401
非常感谢，先生
Much obliged, sir.

1684
02:11:50,286 --> 02:11:51,551
“布克斯顿”

1685
02:15:19,727 --> 02:15:20,990
亲爱的瑞德
Dear Red:

1686
02:15:21,229 --> 02:15:23,697
若你能看到这封信，那你已经出来了
If you're reading this, you've gotten out...

1687
02:15:23,898 --> 02:15:27,959
……如果你已来了这么远，也许可以再前进一点
... and if you've come this far, maybe you'd come a bit further.

1688
02:15:28,236 --> 02:15:30,705
你还记得那个地方的名字，是吗？
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1689
02:15:33,008 --> 02:15:34,498
圣哈塔尼奥
Zihuatanejo.

1690
02:15:36,144 --> 02:15:39,740
我需要一个人和我一起工作
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.

1691
02:15:40,249 --> 02:15:43,776
我期待你的到来，计划已经摆好了
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.

1692
02:15:44,586 --> 02:15:45,986
记住，瑞德
Remember, Red...

1693
02:15:46,321 --> 02:15:48,415
有希望是件好事情
... hope is a good thing...

1694
02:15:48,624 --> 02:15:50,615
也许是世间最好的事情
... maybe the best of things.

1695
02:15:50,825 --> 02:15:52,986
好的事情从不会逝去
And no good thing ever dies.

1696
02:15:53,528 --> 02:15:56,396
我希望这封信能见到你
I will be hoping that this letter finds you...

1697
02:15:56,598 --> 02:15:58,327
见到你很好
... and finds you well.

1698
02:15:58,834 --> 02:16:00,062
你的朋友
Your friend...

1699
02:16:00,268 --> 02:16:01,428
安迪
... Andy.

1700
02:16:35,270 --> 02:16:36,999
“要么忙着活”
"Get busy living...

1701
02:16:37,206 --> 02:16:39,105
“要么忙着死”
... or get busy dying. "

1702
02:16:41,809 --> 02:16:43,970
这话一点都没错
That's goddamn right.

1703
02:16:46,649 --> 02:16:48,952
“瑞德也来过”

1704
02:16:49,216 --> 02:16:51,343
我一生中第二次……
For the second time in my life...

1705
02:16:51,587 --> 02:16:54,145
犯了罪
... I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1706
02:16:55,224 --> 02:16:57,158
违反了假释条例
Parole violation.

1707
02:16:57,824 --> 02:17:01,488
当然，我怀疑他们会因此设下路障
Of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.

1708
02:17:02,163 --> 02:17:04,189
尤其是像我这样的老人家
Not for an old crook like me.

1709
02:17:04,400 --> 02:17:06,425
德萨斯州，汉格堡
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1710
02:17:10,104 --> 02:17:14,837
我发现我很激动，几乎坐不住，思绪纷乱
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1711
02:17:15,277 --> 02:17:18,609
这是一个自由人才能感受到的
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.

1712
02:17:18,814 --> 02:17:21,304
一个自由人开始了漫长的旅程
A free man at the start of a long journey...

1713
02:17:21,516 --> 02:17:24,109
伴随着未知的结局
... whose conclusion is uncertain.

1714
02:17:27,122 --> 02:17:29,783
我希望我能成功越过边界
I hope I can make it across the border.

1715
02:17:31,292 --> 02:17:34,318
我希望看见我的朋友，和他握手
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1716
02:17:36,197 --> 02:17:40,258
我希望太平洋的海水如我梦中那样的蓝
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.

1717
02:17:42,186 --> 02:17:43,312
我希望……
I hope.

1718
02:18:17,840 --> 02:18:22,743
“谨此纪念亚伦格林”

1719
02:18:25,982 --> 02:18:30,681
剧终 谢谢收看

1720
02:18:31,982 --> 02:18:40,681
