1
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:07,470
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,010
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,340
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:23,020
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,050
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:31,960
- What was your response?
- I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,330
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,870
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,570
If they say so.

10
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,600
I really don't remember.
I was upset.

11
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,310
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,250
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,580
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:59,320
Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:02,650
... whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.

16
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:06,160
Did you follow her?

17
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,590
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,170
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:16,270
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,970
... and waited.

21
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,840
With what intention?

22
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,880
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,480
I was confused...

24
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:25,740
... drunk.

25
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,550
I think...

26
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:30,850
... mostly I wanted to scare them.

27
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:34,490
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,790
I was sobering up.

29
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,660
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,840
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,030
I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:50,330
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:53,140
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:55,440
...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:01,020
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,910
Yes, it does.

37
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,290
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:04:06,490 --> 00:04:08,550
...before the murders took place.

39
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,990
That's very convenient.

40
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:12,860
It's the truth.

41
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:17,800
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:22,100
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:04:22,310 --> 00:04:25,750
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,810
And that also...

45
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,720
...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:36,110
Since I am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,950
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,210
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
all the evidence.

49
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:06,250
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

50
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:09,320
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

51
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,490
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

52
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:14,250
And most of all...

53
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:17,520
... we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

54
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:19,760
... lying dead in each other's arms.

55
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:23,560
They had sinned.

56
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:27,300
But was their crime so great...

57
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:29,770
... as to merit a death sentence?

58
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,270
While you think about that...

59
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:35,510
...think about this:

60
00:05:36,380 --> 00:05:40,110
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,020
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:47,020
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:47,230 --> 00:05:48,250
No.

64
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,590
This was revenge...

65
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:54,230
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,830
Four bullets per victim.

67
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,300
Not six shots fired, but eight.

68
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:03,400
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

69
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,580
... and then stopped to reload...

70
00:06:05,810 --> 00:06:09,270
... so that he could shoot
each of them again.

71
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:12,040
An extra bullet per lover...

72
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,580
... right in the head.

73
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,890
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,420
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,130
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:34,600
...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:37,500
...one for each of your victims.
So be it!

78
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:03,800
Sit.

79
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,170
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:15,310
- Yes, sir.
- You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,310
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:21,440
I mean, I learned my lesson.

83
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:25,960
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

84
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,560
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:33,730
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,330
Hey, Red.

87
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,840
How'd it go?

88
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:15,200
Same old shit, different day.

89
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,340
Yeah, I know how you feel.

90
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:19,540
I'm up for rejection next week.

91
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:22,840
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

92
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,350
It happens.

93
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:25,980
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

94
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:29,490
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

95
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,690
Four!

96
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:35,260
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

97
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:37,260
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

98
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:40,560
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

99
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,200
... bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

100
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,530
Damn near anything within reason.

101
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,470
Yes, sir!
I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

102
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:56,350
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

103
00:08:56,550 --> 00:09:00,110
... and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

104
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,580
... I told him, "No problem."

105
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:46,630
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

106
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,730
... in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

107
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:55,130
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

108
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:57,370
Good work for a man so young.

109
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:42,380
You speak English, butt-steak?

110
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:44,450
You follow this officer.

111
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:01,470
I never seen such a sorry-Iooking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

112
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:04,300
Hey, fish! Come over here!

113
00:11:27,570 --> 00:11:28,970
Taking bets today, Red?

114
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:31,030
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

115
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,930
Smokes. Put me down for two.

116
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:35,030
All right, who's your horse?

117
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,000
That little sack of shit.

118
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:41,880
- Eighth. He'll be first.
- Bullshit! I'll take that action.

119
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,280
You're out some smokes, son.

120
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,250
If you're so smart, you call it.

121
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:49,550
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

122
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:52,350
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

123
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,260
Fresh fish today!

124
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,500
We're reeling them in!

125
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:03,830
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

126
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:07,270
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

127
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,730
That was my first impression of the man.

128
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,380
What do you say?

129
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:14,880
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

130
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,210
That guy? Never happen.

131
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,680
- 10 cigarettes.
- That's a rich bet.

132
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,950
Who's going to prove me wrong?

133
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,950
Heywood? Jigger?

134
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:25,550
Skeets?

135
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,090
Floyd!

136
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:30,090
Four brave souls.

137
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,060
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

138
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:36,570
All prisoners,
return to your cellblocks.

139
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,080
Turn to the right!

140
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,590
Eyes front.

141
00:13:12,670 --> 00:13:15,270
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

142
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,570
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

143
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,970
You are convicted felons.

144
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,270
That's why they've sent you to me.

145
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:24,250
Rule number one:

146
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:25,940
No blasphemy.

147
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,890
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

148
00:13:30,090 --> 00:13:31,280
The other rules...

149
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:34,790
...you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

150
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:36,220
When do we eat?

151
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,930
You eat when we say you eat.

152
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:50,410
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

153
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:53,440
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

154
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,680
On your feet.

155
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,650
I believe in two things:

156
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,320
Discipline and the Bible.

157
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,880
Here, you'll receive both.

158
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,820
Put your trust in the Lord.

159
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:09,660
Your ass belongs to me.

160
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,400
Welcome to Shawshank.

161
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,940
Unhook them.

162
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:26,740
Turn around.

163
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:35,020
That's enough.

164
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,910
Move to the end of the cage.

165
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,450
Turn around. Delouse him.

166
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,860
Turn around.

167
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,400
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

168
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:51,930
Next man up!

169
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,670
To the right.

170
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:56,930
Right. Right.

171
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:58,740
Left.

172
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:02,950
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

173
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:06,510
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

174
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,520
... skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

175
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,590
And when they put you in that cell...

176
00:15:13,790 --> 00:15:16,130
... and those bars slam home...

177
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,790
... that's when you know it's for real.

178
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:22,400
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

179
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:27,000
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

180
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,480
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

181
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:34,750
Somebody always breaks down crying.

182
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,910
Happens every time.

183
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:39,610
The only question is...

184
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:41,580
... who's it going to be?

185
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,920
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

186
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,660
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

187
00:15:58,670 --> 00:16:00,330
Lights out!

188
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,190
I remember my first night.

189
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:26,970
Seems like a long time ago.

190
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:31,800
Hey, fish.

191
00:16:32,810 --> 00:16:34,640
Fish, fish.

192
00:16:36,210 --> 00:16:37,970
What are you, scared of the dark?

193
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:43,010
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

194
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,650
Piggy! Pork!
I want me a pork chop.

195
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,230
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

196
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,500
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

197
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,490
Hey, Fat Ass.

198
00:17:06,010 --> 00:17:07,340
Fat Ass!

199
00:17:08,510 --> 00:17:10,240
Talk to me, boy.

200
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,640
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

201
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:16,820
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

202
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,920
This place ain't so bad.

203
00:17:19,350 --> 00:17:20,580
Tell you what...

204
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:24,950
...I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

205
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:28,520
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

206
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,700
...Iove to make your acquaintance.

207
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:34,390
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

208
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,690
God!

209
00:17:36,370 --> 00:17:37,770
I don't belong here!

210
00:17:37,970 --> 00:17:40,800
- We have a winner!
- I want to go home!

211
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,740
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

212
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:48,280
Fresh fish!

213
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:56,220
I want to go home!

214
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,420
I want my mother!

215
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,850
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

216
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:07,220
What the Christ is this horseshit?

217
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,530
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

218
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:12,140
You'll tell him
with my baton up your ass!

219
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,170
Let me out!

220
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,770
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

221
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,970
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

222
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,540
Not me!

223
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:24,080
I won't count to three.
Not even to one.

224
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,340
You shut up,
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

225
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,550
Shut up, man. Shut up!

226
00:18:30,290 --> 00:18:32,950
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

227
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,460
Open that cell.

228
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:37,930
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

229
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,430
Son of a bitch!

230
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,680
Captain, take it easy!

231
00:19:17,070 --> 00:19:20,330
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

232
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:23,980
...I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

233
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,810
Every last motherfucker in here.

234
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,880
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

235
00:19:48,230 --> 00:19:52,860
His first night in the joint, Dufresne
cost me two packs of cigarettes.

236
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:56,060
He never made a sound.

237
00:20:11,420 --> 00:20:13,760
Tier 3 north, clear count!

238
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,490
Tier 2 north, clear count.

239
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,360
Tier 3 south, clear.

240
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,760
Prepare to roll out.

241
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,870
Roll out!

242
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,960
Are you going to eat that?

243
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,900
I hadn't planned on it.

244
00:21:30,970 --> 00:21:32,200
Do you mind?

245
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:42,180
That's nice and ripe.

246
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,990
Jake says thank you.

247
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:59,660
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

248
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,470
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

249
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,410
Oh, no! Here he comes.

250
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,180
Morning, fellas.

251
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,350
Fine morning, isn't it?

252
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:16,910
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

253
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:19,410
Send them down.
I want them lined up...

254
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,250
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

255
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:24,550
Look at that.

256
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,250
- I can't stand this guy.
- Oh, Lord!

257
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:31,400
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

258
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:32,960
Smell my ass!

259
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:35,160
After he smells mine.

260
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,300
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

261
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:42,340
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

262
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:45,070
I owe that boy a big kiss
when I see him.

263
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:49,940
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

264
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,770
Hey, Tyrell.

265
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,110
You pull infirmary duty this week?

266
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,650
How's my horse doing anyway?

267
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,180
Dead.

268
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,220
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

269
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,620
Doc had gone home for the night.

270
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:06,390
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

271
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:09,070
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

272
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:16,670
What was his name?

273
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,310
What'd you say?

274
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,620
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

275
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,050
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

276
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:33,180
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

277
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,240
Anybody come at you yet?

278
00:23:59,390 --> 00:24:01,220
Anybody get to you yet?

279
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:05,410
Hey, we all need friends in here.

280
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:07,390
I could be a friend to you.

281
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,000
Hard to get.

282
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:21,600
I like that.

283
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:31,780
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

284
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:34,090
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

285
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:37,350
... trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

286
00:24:38,090 --> 00:24:41,290
Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

287
00:24:41,490 --> 00:24:43,860
... to say more than two words
to somebody.

288
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,620
As it turned out...

289
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,960
... that somebody was me.

290
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:59,510
I'm Andy Dufresne.

291
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:02,480
Wife-killing banker.

292
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,050
Why'd you do it?

293
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:08,540
I didn't, since you ask.

294
00:25:09,150 --> 00:25:10,990
You're going to fit right in.

295
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,890
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

296
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:17,720
- What you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

297
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:23,330
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

298
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:27,130
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

299
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,810
What do you think?

300
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:32,230
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

301
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:36,180
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

302
00:25:37,150 --> 00:25:40,450
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

303
00:25:40,650 --> 00:25:43,210
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

304
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,220
A rock hammer.

305
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:48,250
- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

306
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:52,320
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

307
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:54,970
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

308
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,930
Fair enough.

309
00:25:58,370 --> 00:26:01,000
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

310
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:03,540
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

311
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,940
For rocks.

312
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:08,770
Quartz?

313
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,180
And some mica, shale...

314
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:18,690
...limestone.

315
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,050
So?

316
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:22,820
So I'm a rock hound.

317
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:26,360
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

318
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:29,760
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

319
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,790
No, I have no enemies here.

320
00:26:33,010 --> 00:26:35,300
No? Wait a while.

321
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,530
Word gets around.

322
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,700
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

323
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:44,880
Especially Bogs.

324
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:49,320
Don't suppose it would help if I
told them I'm not homosexual.

325
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,950
Neither are they.

326
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:54,610
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

327
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:03,530
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

328
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:07,260
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

329
00:27:07,470 --> 00:27:10,240
- Thanks for the advice.
- Well, that's free.

330
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,540
You understand my concern.

331
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:15,340
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

332
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:20,310
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

333
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:22,880
What did I miss?
What's so funny?

334
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,980
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

335
00:27:27,830 --> 00:27:30,060
What's an item like this usually go for?

336
00:27:30,260 --> 00:27:32,750
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

337
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,730
My normal markup's 20 percent.

338
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:38,300
But this is a specialty item.

339
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:42,960
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

340
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:44,510
Ten it is.

341
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,270
Waste of money, if you ask me.

342
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:49,840
Why's that?

343
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:54,280
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

344
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:57,860
They find it, you're going to lose it.

345
00:27:58,060 --> 00:28:00,150
If they catch you, you don't know me.

346
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,590
Mention my name, we never
do business again.

347
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:06,190
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

348
00:28:07,030 --> 00:28:08,590
I understand.

349
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,890
Thank you, Mr...

350
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,130
Red.

351
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:15,170
Name's Red.

352
00:28:16,610 --> 00:28:18,240
Why do they call you that?

353
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,010
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

354
00:28:32,190 --> 00:28:35,060
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

355
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:38,360
He had a quiet way about him...

356
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,860
... a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

357
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,670
He strolled...

358
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:49,070
... like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

359
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:53,940
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

360
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,110
I think it'd be fair to say...

361
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,610
... I liked Andy from the start.

362
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:05,950
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

363
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:11,790
Move it! Come on, move it!

364
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,330
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

365
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,940
Andy was right.

366
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:59,410
I finally got the joke.

367
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,110
It would take a man about 600 years...

368
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,780
... to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

369
00:30:08,550 --> 00:30:10,990
- Book?
- Not today.

370
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,020
Book?

371
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:27,530
Delivery for Dufresne.

372
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,820
Here's your book.

373
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,060
Thanks.

374
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:03,040
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

375
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,900
This will blind you.

376
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:44,680
Honey, hush.

377
00:31:57,230 --> 00:31:59,200
That's it. You fight!

378
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:00,870
Better that way.

379
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:12,200
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

380
00:32:12,410 --> 00:32:14,400
... and the Sisters let him be.

381
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,810
I wish I could tell you that...

382
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,980
... but prison is no fairy-tale world.

383
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,090
He never said who did it.

384
00:32:23,320 --> 00:32:24,910
But we all knew.

385
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:32,250
Things went on like that for a while.

386
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,160
Prison life consists of routine...

387
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:37,400
... and then more routine.

388
00:32:39,910 --> 00:32:43,430
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

389
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:46,740
The Sisters kept at him.

390
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,040
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

391
00:32:49,250 --> 00:32:50,740
Sometimes not.

392
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,080
And that's how it went for Andy.

393
00:32:54,650 --> 00:32:56,420
That was his routine.

394
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:00,690
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

395
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:04,560
And I also believe that
if things had gone on that way...

396
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,330
... this place would have
got the best of him.

397
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:10,900
But then, in the spring of 1949...

398
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,000
... the powers that be decided:

399
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,540
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

400
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,940
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

401
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,110
As you know...

402
00:33:22,850 --> 00:33:26,410
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

403
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:29,020
It was outdoor detail...

404
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:33,690
... and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

405
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:35,260
Stay in line there.

406
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:38,620
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

407
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:45,890
Wallace E. Unger.

408
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,770
Ellis Redding.

409
00:33:48,970 --> 00:33:50,530
Wouldn't you know it?

410
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:54,280
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

411
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,470
Andrew Dufresne.

412
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:59,820
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

413
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,790
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

414
00:34:02,990 --> 00:34:06,450
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

415
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,220
I say, "Yeah?"

416
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:12,120
He says, " Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

417
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:16,230
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I'm not. He was an asshole.

418
00:34:16,430 --> 00:34:18,630
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

419
00:34:18,840 --> 00:34:21,140
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

420
00:34:21,340 --> 00:34:25,470
"He died a rich man." Oil wells
and shit. Close to a million bucks.

421
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,010
A million bucks?

422
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:32,810
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
- You going to see any of that?

423
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,180
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

424
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:37,580
Dollars?

425
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,320
That's great! That's like
winning the sweepstakes.

426
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,750
Isn't it?

427
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,930
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

428
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:48,500
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

429
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,600
Poor Byron.

430
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:54,670
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

431
00:34:54,870 --> 00:34:57,140
Some people really got it awful.

432
00:34:57,410 --> 00:34:58,770
Andy, are you nuts?

433
00:34:58,980 --> 00:35:00,880
IKeep your eyes on your mop, man!

434
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:04,050
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

435
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,050
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

436
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,410
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

437
00:35:09,650 --> 00:35:13,390
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

438
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:17,290
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

439
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,620
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

440
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:23,860
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

441
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,670
- Getting himself killed.
- IKeep tarring.

442
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,430
Some brother.
Shit!

443
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,780
Mr. Hadley...

444
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:40,020
...do you trust your wife?

445
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,120
Oh, that's funny.

446
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,250
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

447
00:35:46,490 --> 00:35:49,820
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?
Try to hamstring you?

448
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:54,330
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

449
00:35:54,570 --> 00:35:55,590
He'll push him off!

450
00:35:55,830 --> 00:35:57,670
If you trust her, you can keep...

451
00:35:57,900 --> 00:35:59,300
...that 35,000.

452
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:02,530
- What did you say?
- Thirty-five thousand.

453
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:04,400
All of it.

454
00:36:04,610 --> 00:36:07,670
- Every penny.
- You better start making sense.

455
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:10,210
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

456
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:14,320
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $ 60,000.

457
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,890
- Bullshit. Tax-free?
- Tax-free.

458
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,060
IRS can't touch one cent.

459
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:21,930
You're that smart banker
that killed his wife.

460
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:25,530
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

461
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:28,560
It's legal. Ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

462
00:36:28,770 --> 00:36:32,830
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

463
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:36,700
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

464
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:40,310
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

465
00:36:40,510 --> 00:36:42,070
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

466
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,540
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

467
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,470
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

468
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,750
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

469
00:36:50,990 --> 00:36:52,720
...nearly free of charge.

470
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,260
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

471
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,750
"Coworkers." That's rich!

472
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:03,120
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

473
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:06,790
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

474
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,230
...sir.

475
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,110
What are you jimmies staring at?

476
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,900
Let's go! Work!

477
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,360
And that's how it came to pass...

478
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,220
... that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

479
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:34,990
... the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

480
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:38,330
... wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

481
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:44,000
... drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

482
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,470
... that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

483
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,110
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

484
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,780
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

485
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:01,380
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

486
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,200
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

487
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,230
We were the lords of all creation.

488
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,390
As for Andy...

489
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,260
... he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

490
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:15,960
... a strange little smile on his face...

491
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,400
... watching us drink his beer.

492
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:27,880
Want a cold one?

493
00:38:28,550 --> 00:38:31,490
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

494
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:38,520
You could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards.

495
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:43,030
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

496
00:38:43,770 --> 00:38:44,830
Me?

497
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:47,830
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

498
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:50,500
... if only for a short while.

499
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:54,240
IKing me.

500
00:38:56,110 --> 00:38:58,740
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
- What?

501
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:00,680
Civilized. Strategic.

502
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:04,340
And a total fucking mystery.
I hate it.

503
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:06,390
Let me teach you someday.

504
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:08,930
Sure.

505
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,120
We could get a board together.

506
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,420
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

507
00:39:14,630 --> 00:39:18,630
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

508
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,140
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

509
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:24,140
I think it'll take years.

510
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,870
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

511
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,050
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

512
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:31,080
Pebbles, mostly.

513
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:38,220
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

514
00:39:39,090 --> 00:39:40,650
Yeah, I guess.

515
00:39:41,290 --> 00:39:42,820
Can I ask you something?

516
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:45,730
Why'd you do it?

517
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,520
I'm innocent, Red.

518
00:39:48,730 --> 00:39:50,760
Just like everybody else here.

519
00:39:55,110 --> 00:39:56,660
What are you in for?

520
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:01,540
Murder. Same as you.

521
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:02,910
Innocent?

522
00:40:05,620 --> 00:40:08,020
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

523
00:41:07,350 --> 00:41:08,840
Where's the canary?

524
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,340
How did you know?

525
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,850
- How did I know what?
- So you don't know.

526
00:41:13,050 --> 00:41:14,210
Come.

527
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:18,810
This is where the canary is.

528
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:24,830
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

529
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:29,730
That's quite a...

530
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:32,330
... surprise.

531
00:41:36,640 --> 00:41:38,040
Wait, wait.

532
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,070
Here she comes.

533
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:43,210
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

534
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:46,140
I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

535
00:41:46,350 --> 00:41:48,250
Gilda, are you decent?

536
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:50,380
Me?
537

537
00:41:53,090 --> 00:41:54,850
God, I love it.

538
00:42:00,030 --> 00:42:03,020
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

539
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,770
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

540
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,100
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

541
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:12,040
Can you get her?

542
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:16,810
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

543
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,350
- Take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

544
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:24,950
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

545
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:26,850
But I'll get her.

546
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,390
Relax.

547
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,560
Thanks.

548
00:42:52,150 --> 00:42:53,910
- Get out!
- I got to change reels!

549
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:56,140
I said fuck off!

550
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:03,660
Ain't you going to scream?

551
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,860
Let's get this over with.

552
00:43:11,970 --> 00:43:13,960
He broke my fucking nose!

553
00:43:23,280 --> 00:43:24,510
Now...

554
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:27,140
...I'm going to open my fly...

555
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:30,180
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

556
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:33,920
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

557
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:36,250
He ought to have
something to show for it.

558
00:43:36,460 --> 00:43:38,330
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

559
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:41,120
No, you don't understand.

560
00:43:41,470 --> 00:43:44,490
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

561
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:48,160
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

562
00:43:48,370 --> 00:43:50,310
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

563
00:43:50,510 --> 00:43:54,000
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

564
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:57,280
...they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

565
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,850
...with a crowbar.

566
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:03,340
Where do you get this shit?

567
00:44:03,550 --> 00:44:04,950
I read it.

568
00:44:06,360 --> 00:44:09,020
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

569
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:11,790
Honey!

570
00:44:13,730 --> 00:44:15,460
You shouldn't!

571
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,040
Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.

572
00:44:21,310 --> 00:44:23,360
And neither did his friends.

573
00:44:23,810 --> 00:44:27,640
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

574
00:44:28,310 --> 00:44:30,800
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

575
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,140
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

576
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:39,750
Time's up, Bogs.

577
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,220
It's your world, boss.

578
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:51,300
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

579
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:54,160
All prisoners report for lock down.

580
00:45:09,090 --> 00:45:10,110
What?

581
00:45:22,770 --> 00:45:25,290
- Where's he going?
- Grab his ankles.

582
00:45:31,110 --> 00:45:32,370
Help!

583
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:38,640
Two things never happened again
after that.

584
00:45:38,920 --> 00:45:42,040
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

585
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:45,380
And Bogs would never walk again.

586
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:50,050
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

587
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:53,030
To my knowledge, he lived out
the rest of his days...

588
00:45:53,230 --> 00:45:55,060
... drinking his food through a straw.

589
00:45:56,070 --> 00:46:00,160
Andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary.

590
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:03,460
Sounds good to us.

591
00:46:03,740 --> 00:46:06,230
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

592
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,240
The man likes to play chess.

593
00:46:09,750 --> 00:46:11,650
Let's get him some rocks.

594
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:45,510
Guys!

595
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:47,340
I got one.

596
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,040
I got one. Look!

597
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:55,020
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

598
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:57,130
What are you, a fucking geologist?

599
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,060
He's right. It ain't.

600
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,160
- What the hell is it then?
- It's a horse apple.

601
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:05,530
- Bullshit!
- No, horseshit.

602
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,200
Petrified.

603
00:47:16,210 --> 00:47:17,410
Damn!

604
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,950
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

605
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:24,140
And by the week Andy
was due back...

606
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:28,050
... we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

607
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:31,380
Also got a big shipment in that week.

608
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:32,790
Cigarettes...

609
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:34,020
... chewing gum...

610
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:35,700
... sipping whisky...

611
00:47:35,900 --> 00:47:39,300
... playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

612
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:42,230
And of course, the most important item:

613
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:46,170
Rita Hayworth herself.

614
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,540
Heads up.
They're tossing cells.

615
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,450
Heads up.
They're tossing cells!

616
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:31,540
119.

617
00:48:33,390 --> 00:48:35,050
123.

618
00:48:45,500 --> 00:48:46,330
On your feet.

619
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:50,460
Face the wall.

620
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:26,510
Turn around and face the warden.

621
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:35,180
Pleased to see you reading this.

622
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:38,450
Any favorite passages?

623
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:41,690
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

624
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:44,120
...when the master
of the house cometh."

625
00:49:45,260 --> 00:49:47,420
Mark 13:35.

626
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:50,030
I've always liked that one.

627
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:52,630
But I prefer...

628
00:49:53,100 --> 00:49:54,970
..." I am the light of the world.

629
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,740
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

630
00:49:58,940 --> 00:50:01,570
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

631
00:50:01,850 --> 00:50:03,870
I hear you're good with numbers.

632
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:05,070
How nice.

633
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:08,250
Man should have a skill.

634
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:11,810
Explain this.

635
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:17,050
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

636
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,400
A little hobby of mine.

637
00:50:30,270 --> 00:50:31,710
It's pretty clean.

638
00:50:31,980 --> 00:50:35,070
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

639
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:41,410
I can't say I approve of this.

640
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,520
But I suppose...

641
00:50:46,590 --> 00:50:48,580
...exceptions can be made.

642
00:50:58,970 --> 00:51:00,300
Lock them up!

643
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:04,770
I almost forgot.

644
00:51:05,210 --> 00:51:07,370
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

645
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:10,050
Salvation lies within.

646
00:51:10,250 --> 00:51:11,310
Yes, sir.

647
00:51:19,860 --> 00:51:22,420
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

648
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,120
Truth is...

649
00:51:24,330 --> 00:51:26,800
... Norton wanted to size Andy up.

650
00:51:40,480 --> 00:51:42,810
My wife made that in church group.

651
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:46,780
Very nice, sir.

652
00:51:48,350 --> 00:51:49,820
You enjoy working the laundry?

653
00:51:51,490 --> 00:51:53,180
No, sir. Not especially.

654
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,960
Perhaps we can find something more...

655
00:51:56,230 --> 00:51:58,660
...befitting a man of your education.

656
00:52:06,740 --> 00:52:08,230
Hey, Jake.
Where's Brooks?

657
00:52:10,070 --> 00:52:12,840
I thought I heard you out here.

658
00:52:13,510 --> 00:52:15,070
I've been reassigned to you.

659
00:52:15,350 --> 00:52:17,680
I know, they told me.

660
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,570
Ain't that a kick in the head?

661
00:52:20,780 --> 00:52:23,080
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

662
00:52:23,290 --> 00:52:24,450
Come on.

663
00:52:25,860 --> 00:52:27,590
Well, here she is.

664
00:52:27,790 --> 00:52:29,780
The Shawshank Prison Library.

665
00:52:30,460 --> 00:52:32,450
National Geographics...

666
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,160
...Reader's Digest condensed books...

667
00:52:36,370 --> 00:52:37,960
...and Louis L'Amour.

668
00:52:38,540 --> 00:52:40,370
Look magazine.

669
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:43,040
Erle Stanley Gardners.

670
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:46,770
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

671
00:52:46,980 --> 00:52:49,640
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

672
00:52:50,150 --> 00:52:52,880
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

673
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:56,520
- Any questions?
- How long have you been librarian?

674
00:52:57,720 --> 00:53:01,750
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

675
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:05,220
And have you ever had an assistant?

676
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,900
No. Not much to it, really.

677
00:53:08,670 --> 00:53:09,890
Why me? Why now?

678
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:11,630
I don't know.

679
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,860
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

680
00:53:26,120 --> 00:53:28,410
That's him.
That's the one.

681
00:53:36,060 --> 00:53:37,220
I'm Dekins.

682
00:53:37,630 --> 00:53:39,260
I was thinking...

683
00:53:39,930 --> 00:53:43,800
...about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

684
00:53:47,710 --> 00:53:49,170
I see.

685
00:53:54,280 --> 00:53:57,250
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

686
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:03,420
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

687
00:54:14,770 --> 00:54:16,060
Thanks.

688
00:54:16,730 --> 00:54:17,790
So...

689
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:21,300
Mister Dekins...

690
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:24,230
And then Andy says, " Mr. Dekins...

691
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,430
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

692
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,700
He didn't say that!

693
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:31,540
As God as my witness!

694
00:54:31,820 --> 00:54:33,540
Dekins blinked for a second...

695
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:36,880
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

696
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:39,590
- My ass!
- Shook his hand.

697
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:42,720
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

698
00:54:42,930 --> 00:54:47,190
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

699
00:54:47,400 --> 00:54:49,990
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

700
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:51,830
Making a few friends?

701
00:54:53,140 --> 00:54:54,800
I wouldn't say "friends."

702
00:54:55,010 --> 00:54:58,840
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

703
00:54:59,040 --> 00:55:01,370
It's a wonderful pet to have.

704
00:55:01,580 --> 00:55:03,380
Got you out of the laundry, though.

705
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,810
It might do more than that.

706
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:08,750
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

707
00:55:08,950 --> 00:55:11,550
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

708
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,250
How do you expect to do that?
I mean...

709
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:19,430
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

710
00:55:19,900 --> 00:55:21,960
I'll ask the warden for funds.

711
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:27,100
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned...

712
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,640
...one immutable, universal truth:

713
00:55:29,870 --> 00:55:31,270
Not one born whose asshole...

714
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:36,410
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

715
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:40,180
- The budget's stretched thin as it is.
- I see.

716
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:43,820
Maybe I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

717
00:55:44,020 --> 00:55:48,120
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

718
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:50,760
More walls, more bars, more guards.

719
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,620
I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

720
00:55:53,830 --> 00:55:56,560
- They can't ignore me forever.
- Sure can.

721
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:59,500
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

722
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:02,400
I'll even mail them for you.
How's that?

723
00:56:04,070 --> 00:56:06,870
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

724
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:08,670
... just like he said.

725
00:56:12,850 --> 00:56:15,480
And like Norton said...

726
00:56:15,690 --> 00:56:17,150
... Andy got no answers.

727
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:30,270
The following April, he did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

728
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,870
Year after that, he did them all...

729
00:56:34,100 --> 00:56:36,040
... including the warden's.

730
00:56:37,770 --> 00:56:41,230
Year after that, they
rescheduled the intramural season...

731
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,880
... to coincide with tax season.

732
00:56:45,450 --> 00:56:49,910
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

733
00:56:50,120 --> 00:56:51,450
So Moresby Prison...

734
00:56:51,660 --> 00:56:53,920
...issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

735
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:55,850
Right. The holster too.

736
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:58,530
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

737
00:56:58,730 --> 00:57:01,760
Yes, sir!
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

738
00:57:02,470 --> 00:57:06,960
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

739
00:57:07,240 --> 00:57:09,710
Could you hand me
a stack of 1040s?

740
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:14,740
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

741
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:19,140
And still, he kept
sending those letters.

742
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,950
It's Brooks.

743
00:57:28,090 --> 00:57:29,580
Watch the door.

744
00:57:29,830 --> 00:57:31,160
Please, Brooks.

745
00:57:31,430 --> 00:57:33,230
- Calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

746
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:36,290
- Stay back, goddamn it!
- What's going on?

747
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:39,060
One second he's fine,
then out come the knives.

748
00:57:39,270 --> 00:57:41,070
We can talk about this, right?

749
00:57:41,340 --> 00:57:45,070
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

750
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:47,070
What's he done to you?

751
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:48,940
It's what they done!

752
00:57:49,450 --> 00:57:50,710
I got no choice.

753
00:57:51,180 --> 00:57:53,480
You won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

754
00:57:53,680 --> 00:57:56,150
- Right, Heywood?
- Sure.

755
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:59,720
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

756
00:57:59,990 --> 00:58:01,080
Right, guys?

757
00:58:02,030 --> 00:58:04,550
So put the knife down.
Look at me.

758
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,030
Put the knife down.

759
00:58:08,970 --> 00:58:11,060
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

760
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,130
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

761
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,510
It's the only way...

762
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:18,770
...they'd let me stay.

763
00:58:19,040 --> 00:58:21,410
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

764
00:58:21,650 --> 00:58:23,700
Put it, put it down.

765
00:58:32,490 --> 00:58:33,980
Take it easy.

766
00:58:34,660 --> 00:58:36,220
You'll be all right.

767
00:58:37,260 --> 00:58:38,850
Him? What about me?

768
00:58:39,060 --> 00:58:41,460
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

769
00:58:41,670 --> 00:58:43,570
You've had worse from shaving.

770
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:45,860
What did you do to set him off?

771
00:58:46,070 --> 00:58:48,300
Nothing.
I come in here to say farewell.

772
00:58:48,910 --> 00:58:51,570
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

773
00:58:53,910 --> 00:58:56,710
I just don't understand
what happened in there.

774
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,710
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

775
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:01,820
That's enough out of you.

776
00:59:02,020 --> 00:59:04,750
- Heard he had you shitting your pants.
- Fuck you.

777
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:06,220
IKnock it off.

778
00:59:07,190 --> 00:59:08,620
Brooks ain't no bug.

779
00:59:12,460 --> 00:59:14,230
He's just institutionalized.

780
00:59:15,600 --> 00:59:17,530
"Institutionalized," my ass.

781
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:21,730
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

782
00:59:21,940 --> 00:59:23,670
This is all he knows.

783
00:59:23,870 --> 00:59:26,170
In here, he's an important man...

784
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,470
...an educated man.

785
00:59:28,280 --> 00:59:30,210
Outside, he's nothing.

786
00:59:31,080 --> 00:59:34,570
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

787
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:37,780
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

788
00:59:38,060 --> 00:59:39,780
You know what I'm trying to say?

789
00:59:40,060 --> 00:59:42,960
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

790
00:59:44,230 --> 00:59:46,460
You believe whatever you want.

791
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:49,460
But I tell you these walls are funny.

792
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:52,730
First you hate them.

793
00:59:54,570 --> 00:59:56,470
Then you get used to them.

794
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,400
Enough time passes...

795
01:00:01,080 --> 01:00:03,070
...you get so you depend on them.

796
01:00:04,080 --> 01:00:06,280
That's "institutionalized."

797
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:07,780
Shit.

798
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:10,750
- I could never get like that.
- Oh, yeah?

799
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:14,110
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

800
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:15,920
Goddamn right.

801
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:20,430
They send you here for life...

802
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,430
...that's exactly what they take.

803
01:00:25,170 --> 01:00:27,160
Part that counts, anyway.

804
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:37,710
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

805
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,540
You go on now.

806
01:00:41,790 --> 01:00:43,280
You're free.

807
01:00:44,550 --> 01:00:46,110
You're free.

808
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:06,800
Good luck, Brooksie.

809
01:01:44,780 --> 01:01:46,270
Dear fellas:

810
01:01:46,550 --> 01:01:50,750
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

811
01:01:52,060 --> 01:01:54,720
Watch it, old-timer!
Want to get killed?

812
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:59,450
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

813
01:02:00,100 --> 01:02:02,530
... but now they're everywhere.

814
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:10,500
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

815
01:02:26,320 --> 01:02:30,090
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

816
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,050
... called "The Brewster"...

817
01:02:32,260 --> 01:02:33,420
... and a job...

818
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,600
... bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

819
01:02:38,130 --> 01:02:40,570
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

820
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:43,140
... but my hands hurt most of the time.

821
01:02:43,440 --> 01:02:45,410
Make sure your man double-bags.

822
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:47,630
Last time, the bottom near came out.

823
01:02:48,310 --> 01:02:51,250
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

824
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:52,810
Yes, sir. Surely will.

825
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:56,540
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

826
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:03,860
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

827
01:03:04,290 --> 01:03:05,780
I keep thinking...

828
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:09,360
... Jake might just show up
and say hello.

829
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,960
But he never does.

830
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:18,040
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

831
01:03:21,650 --> 01:03:24,380
I have trouble sleeping at night.

832
01:03:24,680 --> 01:03:27,950
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

833
01:03:28,220 --> 01:03:30,450
I wake up scared.

834
01:03:30,650 --> 01:03:34,890
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

835
01:03:36,390 --> 01:03:41,300
Maybe I should get a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

836
01:03:41,600 --> 01:03:45,930
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

837
01:03:47,600 --> 01:03:51,600
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

838
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,570
I don't like it here.

839
01:03:53,780 --> 01:03:57,770
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

840
01:03:58,620 --> 01:04:00,280
... not to stay.

841
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:13,750
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

842
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:17,460
... not for an old crook like me.

843
01:05:19,930 --> 01:05:24,200
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

844
01:05:25,240 --> 01:05:29,070
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

845
01:05:29,270 --> 01:05:31,600
No hard feelings. Brooks."

846
01:05:42,090 --> 01:05:44,050
He should have died in here.

847
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:50,990
What the fuck have you done?

848
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,860
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

849
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:03,130
- What's all this?
- You tell me. They're addressed to you.

850
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:05,740
Take it.

851
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:15,770
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

852
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:18,890
In response to your inquiries...

853
01:06:19,090 --> 01:06:23,350
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

854
01:06:24,130 --> 01:06:25,960
This is $ 200.

855
01:06:26,160 --> 01:06:30,160
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded...

856
01:06:30,370 --> 01:06:32,930
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

857
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:37,270
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

858
01:06:37,470 --> 01:06:39,270
Please stop sending us letters."

859
01:06:39,510 --> 01:06:42,170
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

860
01:06:42,410 --> 01:06:43,570
Yes, sir.

861
01:06:47,850 --> 01:06:49,010
Good for you, Andy.

862
01:06:51,990 --> 01:06:53,110
Wow!

863
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,260
It only took six years.

864
01:06:57,830 --> 01:07:00,560
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

865
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,100
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

866
01:07:04,370 --> 01:07:05,200
...like he said.

867
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:06,800
I've got to pinch a loaf.

868
01:07:07,000 --> 01:07:08,470
When I come back...

869
01:07:08,670 --> 01:07:10,430
...this is all gone, all right?

870
01:07:59,190 --> 01:08:00,590
Do you hear that?

871
01:09:09,330 --> 01:09:10,490
Dufresne!

872
01:09:13,030 --> 01:09:14,550
Andy, let me out!

873
01:09:21,440 --> 01:09:26,370
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

874
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,910
Truth is, I don't want to know.

875
01:09:29,110 --> 01:09:31,600
Some things are best left unsaid.

876
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:37,910
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

877
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,250
... it can't be expressed in words...

878
01:09:40,460 --> 01:09:43,360
... and makes your heart ache
because of it.

879
01:09:45,030 --> 01:09:47,520
I tell you, those voices soared...

880
01:09:47,800 --> 01:09:52,100
... higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

881
01:09:52,300 --> 01:09:55,670
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

882
01:09:55,870 --> 01:09:58,640
... and made those walls dissolve away.

883
01:09:59,080 --> 01:10:01,270
And for the briefest of moments...

884
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:04,470
... every last man at Shawshank
felt free.

885
01:10:07,050 --> 01:10:09,710
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

886
01:10:11,020 --> 01:10:12,010
Open the door.

887
01:10:14,920 --> 01:10:16,690
Open it up!

888
01:10:17,990 --> 01:10:20,720
Dufresne, open this door!

889
01:10:22,070 --> 01:10:23,260
Turn that off!

890
01:10:30,340 --> 01:10:32,770
I am warning you. Turn that off!

891
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:52,050
You're mine now.

892
01:10:59,500 --> 01:11:02,730
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

893
01:11:02,940 --> 01:11:04,530
On your feet.

894
01:11:05,710 --> 01:11:08,110
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

895
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:13,540
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

896
01:11:13,880 --> 01:11:16,680
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

897
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:20,010
- Was it worth two weeks?
- Easiest time I ever did.

898
01:11:20,220 --> 01:11:24,420
- No such thing as easy time in the hole.
- A week in the hole is like a year.

899
01:11:24,630 --> 01:11:27,930
- Damn straight.
- I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

900
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:31,100
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

901
01:11:33,540 --> 01:11:34,900
It was in here.

902
01:11:35,740 --> 01:11:36,970
In here.

903
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:40,200
That's the beauty of music. They...

904
01:11:40,410 --> 01:11:42,740
...can't get that from you.

905
01:11:46,280 --> 01:11:48,650
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

906
01:11:50,450 --> 01:11:53,580
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

907
01:11:54,620 --> 01:11:56,320
Lost interest in it, though.

908
01:11:56,530 --> 01:11:58,120
Didn't make much sense in here.

909
01:11:58,460 --> 01:12:00,450
Here's where it makes the most sense.

910
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:03,060
You need it so you don't forget.

911
01:12:03,630 --> 01:12:04,830
Forget?

912
01:12:05,200 --> 01:12:08,300
Forget that there are...

913
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:09,940
...places...

914
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:14,270
...in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

915
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:16,770
There's something...

916
01:12:17,110 --> 01:12:18,510
...inside...

917
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:20,750
...that they can't get to...

918
01:12:20,950 --> 01:12:22,320
...that they can't touch.

919
01:12:22,850 --> 01:12:24,290
That's yours.

920
01:12:25,820 --> 01:12:27,410
What are you talking about?

921
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:29,690
Hope.

922
01:12:30,760 --> 01:12:32,090
Hope.

923
01:12:34,030 --> 01:12:36,020
Let me tell you something, my friend.

924
01:12:36,830 --> 01:12:39,130
Hope is a dangerous thing.

925
01:12:40,300 --> 01:12:42,640
Hope can drive a man insane.

926
01:12:43,370 --> 01:12:45,500
It's got no use on the inside.

927
01:12:45,710 --> 01:12:47,900
You'd better get used to that idea.

928
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:51,900
Like Brooks did?

929
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:18,260
Sit down.

930
01:13:23,610 --> 01:13:26,910
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

931
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,140
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

932
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:31,580
Oh, yes, sir.

933
01:13:32,860 --> 01:13:34,190
Without a doubt.

934
01:13:35,360 --> 01:13:37,760
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

935
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,700
No danger to society here.

936
01:13:42,230 --> 01:13:43,760
God's honest truth.

937
01:13:46,340 --> 01:13:48,430
Absolutely rehabilitated.

938
01:13:58,410 --> 01:13:59,740
Thirty years.

939
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:03,620
Jesus, when you say it like that...

940
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:06,280
You wonder where it went.

941
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,880
I wonder where 10 years went.

942
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:16,890
Here.

943
01:14:17,330 --> 01:14:20,060
A little parole rejection present.

944
01:14:21,330 --> 01:14:23,030
Go ahead and open it.

945
01:14:24,140 --> 01:14:26,160
Went through one of your competitors.

946
01:14:26,370 --> 01:14:29,500
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

947
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:41,040
It's very pretty.

948
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:43,950
Thank you.

949
01:14:46,530 --> 01:14:47,990
You going to play it?

950
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:53,830
No.

951
01:14:57,440 --> 01:14:58,840
Not right now.

952
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,620
Roll in!

953
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:55,060
Lights out!

954
01:16:29,660 --> 01:16:31,790
Andy was as good as his word.

955
01:16:32,170 --> 01:16:34,930
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

956
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:41,100
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

957
01:16:41,340 --> 01:16:44,470
... they couldn't buy him off
with just a $ 200 check.

958
01:16:44,680 --> 01:16:48,980
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

959
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,080
... just to shut him up.

960
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,280
And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

961
01:16:54,490 --> 01:16:57,420
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

962
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:00,390
He bought remaindered books
by the pound...

963
01:17:00,890 --> 01:17:02,420
Treasure Island.

964
01:17:02,960 --> 01:17:04,290
Robert Louis...

965
01:17:04,500 --> 01:17:05,520
Stevenson.

966
01:17:05,730 --> 01:17:07,100
Fiction, adventure.

967
01:17:09,670 --> 01:17:10,690
What's next?

968
01:17:10,900 --> 01:17:13,960
I got here Auto Repair...

969
01:17:14,710 --> 01:17:15,870
...and Soap Carving.

970
01:17:16,080 --> 01:17:19,310
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

971
01:17:19,510 --> 01:17:21,380
Count of Monte Crisco.

972
01:17:21,850 --> 01:17:24,150
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

973
01:17:25,250 --> 01:17:26,240
By Alexandree...

974
01:17:26,720 --> 01:17:27,980
...Dum-ass.

975
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:29,350
Dumb ass.

976
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:32,720
Dumb ass?

977
01:17:35,630 --> 01:17:37,600
Dumas. IKnow what that's about?

978
01:17:39,870 --> 01:17:41,830
You'd like it.
It's about a prison break.

979
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:45,940
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

980
01:17:46,810 --> 01:17:50,900
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

981
01:17:51,480 --> 01:17:53,240
By the year Kennedy was shot...

982
01:17:53,480 --> 01:17:57,970
... Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

983
01:17:58,280 --> 01:18:01,380
... into the best prison library
in New England...

984
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:05,020
... complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

985
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:14,330
That was also when Warden Norton...

986
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:17,470
... instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

987
01:18:17,940 --> 01:18:20,000
You may remember reading about it.

988
01:18:20,240 --> 01:18:23,330
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

989
01:18:23,540 --> 01:18:24,840
It's no free ride...

990
01:18:25,050 --> 01:18:28,280
...but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

991
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:30,970
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

992
01:18:31,320 --> 01:18:33,840
Our inmates, properly supervised...

993
01:18:34,050 --> 01:18:36,680
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

994
01:18:36,890 --> 01:18:40,450
...performing all manner
of public service.

995
01:18:40,730 --> 01:18:42,960
These men can learn the value...

996
01:18:43,160 --> 01:18:46,960
...of an honest day's labor and
provide a service to the community...

997
01:18:47,170 --> 01:18:51,870
...at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

998
01:18:52,310 --> 01:18:54,640
Of course he didn't tell the press...

999
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:58,300
... that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1000
01:18:58,510 --> 01:19:01,540
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1001
01:19:01,750 --> 01:19:04,240
Men, materials, you name it.

1002
01:19:04,580 --> 01:19:07,490
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1003
01:19:07,690 --> 01:19:10,210
At this rate,
you'll put me out of business.

1004
01:19:10,420 --> 01:19:14,860
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1005
01:19:15,430 --> 01:19:18,400
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1006
01:19:18,600 --> 01:19:22,260
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed.

1007
01:19:24,940 --> 01:19:26,460
We go back a long way.

1008
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:32,710
I need this highway contract. I don't
get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1009
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:35,410
You have some of this fine pie...

1010
01:19:35,650 --> 01:19:38,980
...my missus made for you.
You think about that.

1011
01:19:47,260 --> 01:19:49,960
I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1012
01:19:50,200 --> 01:19:53,260
I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1013
01:19:55,240 --> 01:19:58,300
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1014
01:19:59,410 --> 01:20:01,570
And behind every shady deal...

1015
01:20:01,910 --> 01:20:04,540
... behind every dollar earned...

1016
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:07,870
... there was Andy, keeping the books.

1017
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,540
Two deposits.

1018
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:13,910
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1019
01:20:44,120 --> 01:20:48,450
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1020
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:52,450
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1021
01:20:52,660 --> 01:20:53,990
How do I look?

1022
01:20:55,030 --> 01:20:57,520
- Very nice.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1023
01:20:57,730 --> 01:20:59,250
Governor will be there.

1024
01:21:00,670 --> 01:21:02,130
You want the rest of this?

1025
01:21:03,470 --> 01:21:05,400
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1026
01:21:06,640 --> 01:21:07,970
Thank you, sir.

1027
01:21:10,810 --> 01:21:14,040
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1028
01:21:14,250 --> 01:21:19,080
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. IKickbacks on his kickbacks.

1029
01:21:19,290 --> 01:21:21,650
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1030
01:21:21,860 --> 01:21:25,690
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1031
01:21:25,890 --> 01:21:27,660
That's where I come in.

1032
01:21:28,260 --> 01:21:30,560
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1033
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,600
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1034
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:37,460
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back...

1035
01:21:37,670 --> 01:21:40,640
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
- Cleaner.

1036
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:44,840
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1037
01:21:47,180 --> 01:21:51,510
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1038
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:54,480
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1039
01:21:54,690 --> 01:21:57,710
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1040
01:21:57,920 --> 01:22:01,330
Now anybody gets curious,
FBI, IRS...

1041
01:22:01,530 --> 01:22:02,520
...whatever.

1042
01:22:02,960 --> 01:22:04,260
It'll lead to somebody.

1043
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:08,330
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1044
01:22:12,710 --> 01:22:13,690
All right, who?

1045
01:22:13,910 --> 01:22:15,500
Randall Stevens.

1046
01:22:16,040 --> 01:22:16,970
Who?

1047
01:22:17,180 --> 01:22:19,170
The "silent" silent partner.

1048
01:22:19,380 --> 01:22:22,440
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1049
01:22:22,650 --> 01:22:24,810
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1050
01:22:25,020 --> 01:22:27,890
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1051
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:29,720
But who is he?

1052
01:22:29,920 --> 01:22:33,880
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1053
01:22:34,990 --> 01:22:36,150
I conjured him...

1054
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:37,730
...out of thin air.

1055
01:22:38,530 --> 01:22:41,260
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1056
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:46,700
You can't just make a person up.

1057
01:22:46,910 --> 01:22:50,000
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1058
01:22:50,510 --> 01:22:53,340
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1059
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,310
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1060
01:22:56,520 --> 01:22:58,640
...driver's license, Social Security.

1061
01:22:58,920 --> 01:22:59,910
You're shitting me.

1062
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:03,490
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1063
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:05,420
...a figment of my imagination.

1064
01:23:05,630 --> 01:23:07,620
Well, I'll be damned!

1065
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:10,690
Did I say you were good?

1066
01:23:11,060 --> 01:23:12,690
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1067
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:15,160
The funny thing is...

1068
01:23:15,370 --> 01:23:19,460
...on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1069
01:23:19,870 --> 01:23:22,200
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1070
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,380
Ever bother you?

1071
01:23:33,820 --> 01:23:36,880
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1072
01:23:37,160 --> 01:23:39,150
A fine line, maybe...

1073
01:23:39,730 --> 01:23:41,790
...but I also built that library...

1074
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:45,020
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1075
01:23:45,230 --> 01:23:47,460
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1076
01:23:47,670 --> 01:23:49,860
IKeep you happy and doing the laundry.

1077
01:23:50,070 --> 01:23:51,540
Money instead of sheets.

1078
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:54,500
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1079
01:24:11,760 --> 01:24:14,390
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

1080
01:24:14,630 --> 01:24:16,860
... on a two-year stretch for B & E.

1081
01:24:17,100 --> 01:24:19,430
That's breaking and entering to you.

1082
01:24:19,700 --> 01:24:23,930
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1083
01:24:24,370 --> 01:24:25,670
Young punk.

1084
01:24:25,870 --> 01:24:27,500
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1085
01:24:27,710 --> 01:24:29,230
... cocky as hell.

1086
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:31,840
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1087
01:24:32,080 --> 01:24:33,840
Making me look bad.

1088
01:24:34,050 --> 01:24:35,840
We liked him immediately.

1089
01:24:36,080 --> 01:24:39,810
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1090
01:24:40,120 --> 01:24:43,750
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1091
01:24:44,390 --> 01:24:46,360
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1092
01:24:46,560 --> 01:24:51,020
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1093
01:24:51,230 --> 01:24:55,030
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, " Yes, sir. I did.

1094
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:58,690
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1095
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:05,470
You done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1096
01:25:05,980 --> 01:25:09,940
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1097
01:25:10,220 --> 01:25:12,150
Weekend furloughs.
Work programs.

1098
01:25:12,350 --> 01:25:13,410
Not like here.

1099
01:25:13,620 --> 01:25:16,050
Sounds like you done time all over.

1100
01:25:16,490 --> 01:25:18,890
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1101
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:21,290
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1102
01:25:21,490 --> 01:25:24,160
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1103
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:27,160
What I mean is...

1104
01:25:27,500 --> 01:25:30,940
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1105
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:34,400
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1106
01:25:34,810 --> 01:25:36,400
What are you in for?

1107
01:25:36,680 --> 01:25:37,670
Me?

1108
01:25:40,110 --> 01:25:41,770
A lawyer fucked me.

1109
01:25:45,690 --> 01:25:48,650
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1110
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,970
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1111
01:26:01,530 --> 01:26:03,660
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

1112
01:26:03,870 --> 01:26:06,360
... or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1113
01:26:06,670 --> 01:26:08,040
Whatever it was...

1114
01:26:08,370 --> 01:26:10,810
... something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.

1115
01:26:14,650 --> 01:26:17,510
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1116
01:26:17,720 --> 01:26:20,240
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1117
01:26:21,590 --> 01:26:23,820
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1118
01:26:25,220 --> 01:26:27,720
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1119
01:26:29,460 --> 01:26:31,290
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1120
01:26:32,970 --> 01:26:34,400
You really mean that?

1121
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:36,800
Yes, sir, I do.

1122
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,970
Good. Because if we do this...

1123
01:26:39,170 --> 01:26:43,130
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1124
01:26:43,380 --> 01:26:45,170
Thing is, see...

1125
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:47,970
...I don't read so good.

1126
01:26:49,150 --> 01:26:50,240
"Well."

1127
01:26:52,250 --> 01:26:53,980
You don't read...

1128
01:26:54,220 --> 01:26:55,740
...so well.

1129
01:26:58,090 --> 01:26:59,580
We'll get to that.

1130
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:06,160
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1131
01:27:06,370 --> 01:27:08,990
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1132
01:27:11,140 --> 01:27:13,330
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1133
01:27:13,610 --> 01:27:16,370
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1134
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:22,150
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1135
01:27:22,350 --> 01:27:24,010
He really liked the kid.

1136
01:27:24,220 --> 01:27:27,780
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1137
01:27:28,290 --> 01:27:30,550
But that wasn't the only reason.

1138
01:27:31,260 --> 01:27:33,450
Prison time is slow time.

1139
01:27:33,930 --> 01:27:36,520
So you do what you can to keep going.

1140
01:27:36,860 --> 01:27:38,920
Some fellas collect stamps.

1141
01:27:39,330 --> 01:27:41,800
Others build matchstick houses.

1142
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:45,060
Andy built a library.

1143
01:27:45,570 --> 01:27:47,510
Now he needed a new project.

1144
01:27:48,370 --> 01:27:49,860
Tommy was it.

1145
01:27:50,510 --> 01:27:54,500
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1146
01:27:55,050 --> 01:27:58,280
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1147
01:27:59,190 --> 01:28:00,450
In prison...

1148
01:28:00,720 --> 01:28:04,450
... a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1149
01:28:05,220 --> 01:28:10,090
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1150
01:28:10,330 --> 01:28:12,520
... it was lovely Raquel.

1151
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,070
Time.

1152
01:28:36,120 --> 01:28:37,110
Well?

1153
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:40,850
Well, it's for shit.

1154
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,190
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1155
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:45,890
It's probably not that bad.

1156
01:28:46,100 --> 01:28:50,330
I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1157
01:28:50,540 --> 01:28:52,270
Let's see how the score comes out.

1158
01:28:52,470 --> 01:28:55,440
I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1159
01:28:57,380 --> 01:28:58,740
Two points, right there!

1160
01:28:58,940 --> 01:29:00,500
There's your goddamn score!

1161
01:29:00,750 --> 01:29:04,440
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1162
01:29:05,380 --> 01:29:07,010
Fuck this place!

1163
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:08,380
Fuck it!

1164
01:29:27,540 --> 01:29:28,800
I feel bad.

1165
01:29:29,010 --> 01:29:30,200
I let him down.

1166
01:29:30,410 --> 01:29:32,140
That's crap, kid.

1167
01:29:32,350 --> 01:29:33,680
He's proud of you.

1168
01:29:34,010 --> 01:29:36,880
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1169
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:38,640
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1170
01:29:38,850 --> 01:29:41,980
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1171
01:29:42,190 --> 01:29:44,420
What's he in here for anyway?

1172
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,720
Murder.

1173
01:29:47,190 --> 01:29:48,560
The hell, you say.

1174
01:29:50,700 --> 01:29:53,030
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1175
01:29:54,270 --> 01:29:58,360
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1176
01:30:06,380 --> 01:30:07,370
What?

1177
01:30:08,710 --> 01:30:11,270
About four years ago...

1178
01:30:11,550 --> 01:30:14,780
...I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1179
01:30:15,290 --> 01:30:16,580
I stole a car.

1180
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:18,950
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1181
01:30:19,630 --> 01:30:21,860
About six months left to go...

1182
01:30:22,160 --> 01:30:24,060
...I get a new cellmate in.

1183
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,390
Elmo Blatch.

1184
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:28,430
Big, twitchy fucker.

1185
01:30:29,300 --> 01:30:32,790
IKind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1186
01:30:33,010 --> 01:30:35,740
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1187
01:30:36,010 --> 01:30:38,270
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1188
01:30:38,480 --> 01:30:43,410
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1189
01:30:44,480 --> 01:30:49,110
Talked all the time too. That's
the other thing. He never shut up.

1190
01:30:49,320 --> 01:30:50,950
Places he'd been in...

1191
01:30:51,260 --> 01:30:54,320
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1192
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:56,760
Even people he killed.

1193
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,800
People who "gave him shit."

1194
01:31:01,430 --> 01:31:02,990
That's how he put it.

1195
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:07,660
So one night, like a joke...

1196
01:31:08,770 --> 01:31:12,270
...I say to him,
"Elmo, who did you kill?"

1197
01:31:12,510 --> 01:31:13,600
So he says:

1198
01:31:13,810 --> 01:31:17,770
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1199
01:31:18,450 --> 01:31:22,350
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1200
01:31:24,460 --> 01:31:26,450
So I pick out this guy...

1201
01:31:27,360 --> 01:31:28,920
...go in one night...

1202
01:31:29,130 --> 01:31:30,860
...and do his place.

1203
01:31:32,300 --> 01:31:33,630
He wakes up...

1204
01:31:34,370 --> 01:31:36,130
...and gives me shit.

1205
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,860
So I killed him.

1206
01:31:40,640 --> 01:31:43,470
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1207
01:31:44,880 --> 01:31:47,140
And that's the best part.

1208
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:50,280
She's fucking this prick, see...

1209
01:31:50,480 --> 01:31:53,540
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1210
01:31:54,150 --> 01:31:56,710
Some hotshot banker.

1211
01:31:58,160 --> 01:32:00,650
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1212
01:32:12,140 --> 01:32:16,010
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1213
01:32:17,280 --> 01:32:19,770
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1214
01:32:20,510 --> 01:32:21,480
Sir?

1215
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:27,310
It's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1216
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:31,860
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1217
01:32:32,060 --> 01:32:34,220
He's young, not terribly bright.

1218
01:32:34,760 --> 01:32:38,200
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1219
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,160
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1220
01:32:40,930 --> 01:32:45,100
Let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1221
01:32:45,370 --> 01:32:50,000
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.

1222
01:32:50,210 --> 01:32:52,910
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1223
01:32:53,110 --> 01:32:55,910
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1224
01:32:56,120 --> 01:32:58,580
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1225
01:32:58,820 --> 01:33:00,750
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1226
01:33:00,950 --> 01:33:03,420
They'd have his last known address.

1227
01:33:03,620 --> 01:33:05,560
It's a chance, isn't it?

1228
01:33:07,890 --> 01:33:09,620
How can you be so obtuse?

1229
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,550
What?

1230
01:33:13,070 --> 01:33:14,530
What did you call me?

1231
01:33:14,730 --> 01:33:16,460
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1232
01:33:16,840 --> 01:33:18,330
You're forgetting yourself.

1233
01:33:18,670 --> 01:33:21,610
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1234
01:33:21,810 --> 01:33:24,570
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1235
01:33:24,780 --> 01:33:27,470
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1236
01:33:27,680 --> 01:33:30,270
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1237
01:33:30,480 --> 01:33:33,080
If I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1238
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:36,690
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1239
01:33:38,560 --> 01:33:41,490
Don't ever mention money to me,
you son of a bitch!

1240
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:43,360
Not in this office...

1241
01:33:43,560 --> 01:33:45,500
...not anywhere.
Get in here, now!

1242
01:33:45,730 --> 01:33:48,430
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1243
01:33:49,070 --> 01:33:50,330
Solitary. A month.

1244
01:33:51,340 --> 01:33:52,630
What's wrong with you?

1245
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,140
Get him out of here.

1246
01:33:54,340 --> 01:33:55,900
This is my chance to get out!

1247
01:33:56,110 --> 01:33:57,910
It's my life! Understand?!

1248
01:33:58,110 --> 01:34:00,170
Get him out!

1249
01:34:01,950 --> 01:34:03,920
A month in the hole.

1250
01:34:04,120 --> 01:34:06,810
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1251
01:34:07,020 --> 01:34:08,320
It's all my fault.

1252
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,110
Bullshit.

1253
01:34:10,790 --> 01:34:13,490
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1254
01:34:13,690 --> 01:34:16,090
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1255
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:18,320
I mean, for real innocent?

1256
01:34:18,530 --> 01:34:19,860
It looks that way.

1257
01:34:20,300 --> 01:34:22,200
Sweet Jesus.

1258
01:34:22,470 --> 01:34:24,300
How long has he been here now?

1259
01:34:24,700 --> 01:34:27,970
1947. What is that?
Nineteen years.

1260
01:34:28,210 --> 01:34:30,800
- Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1261
01:34:36,650 --> 01:34:37,810
What you got?

1262
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:39,780
Board of Education.

1263
01:34:39,990 --> 01:34:41,510
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1264
01:34:41,720 --> 01:34:45,680
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1265
01:34:45,890 --> 01:34:48,050
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1266
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:51,390
Skeets, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1267
01:34:52,230 --> 01:34:53,560
Floyd, come on.

1268
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,400
Will you throw that away, please?

1269
01:35:07,010 --> 01:35:08,740
Well, shit.

1270
01:35:21,430 --> 01:35:24,230
The kid passed. C + average.

1271
01:35:24,430 --> 01:35:26,520
Thought you'd like to know.

1272
01:35:42,750 --> 01:35:44,220
Warden wants to talk.

1273
01:35:57,960 --> 01:35:59,020
Out here?

1274
01:35:59,230 --> 01:36:01,460
That's what the man said.

1275
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:18,570
Warden?

1276
01:36:28,590 --> 01:36:32,660
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1277
01:36:34,170 --> 01:36:36,430
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1278
01:36:54,890 --> 01:36:56,950
We got a situation here.

1279
01:36:57,820 --> 01:36:59,920
I think you can appreciate that.

1280
01:37:00,130 --> 01:37:01,350
Yes, sir.

1281
01:37:01,630 --> 01:37:03,030
I sure can.

1282
01:37:03,300 --> 01:37:07,320
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1283
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:11,360
It's got me up nights.
That's the truth.

1284
01:37:13,640 --> 01:37:15,470
The right thing to do...

1285
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:20,870
...sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1286
01:37:21,880 --> 01:37:23,310
Do you understand?

1287
01:37:25,620 --> 01:37:27,210
I need your help, son.

1288
01:37:28,650 --> 01:37:30,820
If I'm going to move on this...

1289
01:37:31,160 --> 01:37:34,320
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1290
01:37:35,060 --> 01:37:36,120
I have to know...

1291
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:38,960
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1292
01:37:39,160 --> 01:37:40,290
Yes, sir.

1293
01:37:40,500 --> 01:37:41,730
Absolutely.

1294
01:37:42,230 --> 01:37:45,230
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1295
01:37:45,440 --> 01:37:47,430
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1296
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,300
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1297
01:37:50,510 --> 01:37:52,310
Just give me that chance.

1298
01:37:56,580 --> 01:37:57,910
That's what I thought.

1299
01:38:45,000 --> 01:38:46,900
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1300
01:38:48,670 --> 01:38:49,690
Terrible thing.

1301
01:38:51,300 --> 01:38:52,770
A man that young...

1302
01:38:53,110 --> 01:38:55,700
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1303
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:58,730
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1304
01:38:59,480 --> 01:39:00,970
Truly, it did.

1305
01:39:03,980 --> 01:39:06,420
We just have to put it behind us.

1306
01:39:08,090 --> 01:39:09,310
Move on.

1307
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,410
I'm done.

1308
01:39:13,730 --> 01:39:15,350
Everything stops.

1309
01:39:17,330 --> 01:39:19,660
Get someone else to run your scams.

1310
01:39:20,930 --> 01:39:22,760
Nothing stops.

1311
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,260
Nothing.

1312
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:31,770
Or you will do
the hardest time there is.

1313
01:39:32,180 --> 01:39:34,480
No more protection from the guards.

1314
01:39:34,710 --> 01:39:39,620
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1315
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:43,450
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1316
01:39:44,860 --> 01:39:46,350
And the library?

1317
01:39:47,030 --> 01:39:48,010
Gone.

1318
01:39:48,630 --> 01:39:51,190
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1319
01:39:51,660 --> 01:39:54,330
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1320
01:39:54,530 --> 01:39:56,660
They'll see the flames for miles.

1321
01:39:56,870 --> 01:39:59,700
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1322
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:03,970
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1323
01:40:07,710 --> 01:40:09,580
Or am I being obtuse?

1324
01:40:21,360 --> 01:40:23,990
Give him another month
to think about it.

1325
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:13,800
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1326
01:41:14,610 --> 01:41:16,440
Like a closed book.

1327
01:41:17,250 --> 01:41:19,270
Complained about it all the time.

1328
01:41:20,220 --> 01:41:21,780
She was beautiful.

1329
01:41:24,190 --> 01:41:25,710
God, I loved her.

1330
01:41:29,430 --> 01:41:31,660
I didn't know how
to show it, that's all.

1331
01:41:34,400 --> 01:41:36,060
I killed her, Red.

1332
01:41:37,940 --> 01:41:39,730
I didn't pull the trigger...

1333
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:42,900
...but I drove her away.

1334
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:47,110
That's why she died, because of me...

1335
01:41:47,310 --> 01:41:48,680
...the way I am.

1336
01:41:57,690 --> 01:41:59,520
That don't make you a murderer.

1337
01:42:02,890 --> 01:42:04,660
Bad husband, maybe.

1338
01:42:08,300 --> 01:42:11,570
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1339
01:42:11,770 --> 01:42:13,100
No, I didn't.

1340
01:42:13,510 --> 01:42:15,440
Somebody else did.

1341
01:42:16,680 --> 01:42:18,770
And I wound up in here.

1342
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:22,840
Bad luck, I guess.

1343
01:42:28,050 --> 01:42:29,490
It floats around.

1344
01:42:30,520 --> 01:42:32,750
It's got to land on somebody.

1345
01:42:33,660 --> 01:42:35,560
It was my turn, that's all.

1346
01:42:36,260 --> 01:42:39,030
I was in the path of the tornado.

1347
01:42:44,970 --> 01:42:48,930
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1348
01:42:53,280 --> 01:42:54,970
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1349
01:42:56,210 --> 01:42:57,240
Me?

1350
01:43:00,220 --> 01:43:01,210
Yeah.

1351
01:43:02,550 --> 01:43:04,850
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1352
01:43:05,060 --> 01:43:08,220
...and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs.

1353
01:43:10,260 --> 01:43:11,890
I tell you where I'd go.

1354
01:43:13,370 --> 01:43:15,030
Zihuatanejo.

1355
01:43:15,900 --> 01:43:17,100
Say what?

1356
01:43:17,400 --> 01:43:19,230
Zihuatanejo.

1357
01:43:20,170 --> 01:43:21,830
It's in Mexico.

1358
01:43:23,210 --> 01:43:25,340
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1359
01:43:26,480 --> 01:43:29,280
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1360
01:43:31,080 --> 01:43:33,070
They say it has no memory.

1361
01:43:35,050 --> 01:43:37,720
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1362
01:43:39,360 --> 01:43:41,850
A warm place with no memory.

1363
01:43:45,100 --> 01:43:47,030
Open up a little hotel...

1364
01:43:48,730 --> 01:43:50,220
...right on the beach.

1365
01:43:50,840 --> 01:43:53,030
Buy some worthless old boat...

1366
01:43:53,570 --> 01:43:55,200
...and fix it up new.

1367
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,170
Take my guests out...

1368
01:44:00,010 --> 01:44:01,380
...charter fishing.

1369
01:44:05,220 --> 01:44:06,950
Zihuatanejo.

1370
01:44:10,490 --> 01:44:14,360
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1371
01:44:20,900 --> 01:44:23,730
I don't think I could make it
on the outside.

1372
01:44:30,410 --> 01:44:32,470
I been in here most of my life.

1373
01:44:33,910 --> 01:44:35,680
I'm an institutional man now.

1374
01:44:36,580 --> 01:44:38,310
Just like Brooks was.

1375
01:44:39,780 --> 01:44:41,480
You underestimate yourself.

1376
01:44:42,050 --> 01:44:43,650
I don't think so.

1377
01:44:47,490 --> 01:44:51,430
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1378
01:44:52,200 --> 01:44:54,720
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1379
01:44:54,930 --> 01:44:57,160
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1380
01:44:59,300 --> 01:45:00,930
Pacific Ocean?

1381
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:02,570
Shit.

1382
01:45:02,940 --> 01:45:05,140
Scare me to death,
something that big.

1383
01:45:05,340 --> 01:45:06,640
Not me.

1384
01:45:07,850 --> 01:45:10,610
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1385
01:45:12,350 --> 01:45:15,580
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1386
01:45:16,620 --> 01:45:18,110
That hotel, that boat...

1387
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:22,120
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1388
01:45:27,030 --> 01:45:29,470
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1389
01:45:29,670 --> 01:45:31,690
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1390
01:45:32,140 --> 01:45:34,610
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1391
01:45:34,810 --> 01:45:36,360
...and that's the way it is.

1392
01:45:36,710 --> 01:45:39,540
Yeah, right.
That's the way it is.

1393
01:45:41,050 --> 01:45:43,450
It's down there and I'm in here.

1394
01:45:46,020 --> 01:45:48,750
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1395
01:45:51,660 --> 01:45:53,150
Get busy living...

1396
01:45:54,530 --> 01:45:56,550
...or get busy dying.

1397
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:11,400
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1398
01:46:11,610 --> 01:46:13,870
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1399
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:19,620
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1400
01:46:21,090 --> 01:46:24,210
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1401
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:28,360
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1402
01:46:28,560 --> 01:46:31,430
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1403
01:46:32,360 --> 01:46:34,860
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1404
01:46:36,270 --> 01:46:38,360
We went there for a picnic...

1405
01:46:38,770 --> 01:46:40,860
...and made love under that oak...

1406
01:46:41,540 --> 01:46:43,770
...and I asked and she said yes.

1407
01:46:47,780 --> 01:46:49,610
Promise me, Red.

1408
01:46:50,450 --> 01:46:52,080
If you ever get out...

1409
01:46:52,280 --> 01:46:53,770
...find that spot.

1410
01:46:54,950 --> 01:46:59,790
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1411
01:47:00,930 --> 01:47:03,950
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1412
01:47:06,630 --> 01:47:09,290
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1413
01:47:10,070 --> 01:47:11,300
What, Andy?

1414
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:13,470
What's buried under there?

1415
01:47:15,070 --> 01:47:16,940
You'll have to pry it up...

1416
01:47:17,140 --> 01:47:18,400
...to see.

1417
01:47:24,280 --> 01:47:26,250
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1418
01:47:26,920 --> 01:47:28,650
He's talking funny.

1419
01:47:29,750 --> 01:47:31,450
I'm really worried about him.

1420
01:47:31,860 --> 01:47:33,290
Let's keep an eye on him.

1421
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:36,760
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1422
01:47:38,200 --> 01:47:39,320
Oh, Lord.

1423
01:47:40,670 --> 01:47:41,500
What?

1424
01:47:43,000 --> 01:47:45,770
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1425
01:47:45,970 --> 01:47:48,060
He asked me for a length of rope.

1426
01:47:48,270 --> 01:47:49,100
Rope?

1427
01:47:49,310 --> 01:47:50,970
Six feet long.

1428
01:47:51,210 --> 01:47:52,570
And you gave it to him.

1429
01:47:53,450 --> 01:47:55,240
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

1430
01:47:55,450 --> 01:47:57,010
Jesus! Heywood.

1431
01:47:57,620 --> 01:47:59,580
How was I supposed to know?

1432
01:47:59,780 --> 01:48:01,340
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1433
01:48:03,350 --> 01:48:05,290
Andy would never do that.

1434
01:48:05,890 --> 01:48:06,950
Never.

1435
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:10,360
I don't know.

1436
01:48:13,200 --> 01:48:15,220
Every man has his breaking point.

1437
01:48:17,570 --> 01:48:19,830
Lickety-split.
Want to get home.

1438
01:48:20,140 --> 01:48:21,900
Just about finished, sir.

1439
01:48:39,020 --> 01:48:40,650
Three deposits tonight.

1440
01:48:48,630 --> 01:48:50,530
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1441
01:48:50,740 --> 01:48:52,360
And shine my shoes.

1442
01:48:52,570 --> 01:48:55,510
- I want them looking like mirrors.
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:49:01,010 --> 01:49:02,480
It's good having you back.

1444
01:49:03,410 --> 01:49:05,280
Place wasn't the same without you.

1445
01:49:52,160 --> 01:49:53,220
Lights out!

1446
01:50:26,060 --> 01:50:28,590
I've had some long nights in stir.

1447
01:50:29,130 --> 01:50:31,800
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1448
01:50:32,000 --> 01:50:34,670
... time can draw out like a blade.

1449
01:50:40,010 --> 01:50:43,000
That was the longest night of my life.

1450
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:00,020
Give me a count!

1451
01:51:04,540 --> 01:51:07,370
Tier 3 south, clear!

1452
01:51:10,510 --> 01:51:13,670
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1453
01:51:13,880 --> 01:51:14,940
Dufresne!

1454
01:51:15,480 --> 01:51:17,910
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1455
01:51:21,050 --> 01:51:24,450
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1456
01:51:32,030 --> 01:51:35,860
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1457
01:51:36,070 --> 01:51:39,370
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1458
01:51:39,570 --> 01:51:40,900
You hear me?

1459
01:51:47,010 --> 01:51:49,100
Oh, my Holy God.

1460
01:52:06,100 --> 01:52:08,660
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1461
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,660
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1462
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:15,800
Open 237.

1463
01:52:19,310 --> 01:52:22,970
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1464
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:25,180
Don't tell me that again.

1465
01:52:25,380 --> 01:52:26,410
But sir, he wasn't.

1466
01:52:26,650 --> 01:52:30,110
I can see that, Haig!
Think I'm blind?

1467
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:32,190
Is that what you're saying?

1468
01:52:32,390 --> 01:52:35,050
- Am I blind, Haig?
- No, sir!

1469
01:52:35,960 --> 01:52:38,450
What about you. You blind?

1470
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:41,520
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1471
01:52:41,730 --> 01:52:45,030
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1472
01:52:45,240 --> 01:52:46,570
"Dufresne."

1473
01:52:48,240 --> 01:52:49,710
He was in his cell...

1474
01:52:49,940 --> 01:52:50,910
...at lights out.

1475
01:52:51,110 --> 01:52:53,370
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

1476
01:52:54,410 --> 01:52:56,040
I want him found.

1477
01:52:56,250 --> 01:52:59,710
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1478
01:52:59,950 --> 01:53:01,150
Yes, sir.

1479
01:53:02,150 --> 01:53:04,420
Let's go. Move your butts.

1480
01:53:07,830 --> 01:53:08,810
Stand.

1481
01:53:10,260 --> 01:53:11,320
Well?

1482
01:53:14,770 --> 01:53:15,760
Well, what?

1483
01:53:15,970 --> 01:53:19,430
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1484
01:53:20,510 --> 01:53:22,000
He must have said something.

1485
01:53:22,740 --> 01:53:24,260
No, sir, Warden.

1486
01:53:24,640 --> 01:53:25,610
Not a word.

1487
01:53:27,450 --> 01:53:30,010
Lord, it's a miracle!

1488
01:53:30,620 --> 01:53:33,180
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1489
01:53:33,850 --> 01:53:35,010
Nothing left...

1490
01:53:35,850 --> 01:53:38,580
...but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1491
01:53:38,790 --> 01:53:41,520
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1492
01:53:41,730 --> 01:53:43,490
Maybe she knows.

1493
01:53:43,730 --> 01:53:46,460
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1494
01:53:47,900 --> 01:53:49,200
Guess not.

1495
01:53:49,770 --> 01:53:51,960
Why should she be any different?

1496
01:53:53,040 --> 01:53:54,700
This is a conspiracy.

1497
01:53:55,340 --> 01:53:57,170
That's what this is.

1498
01:53:57,780 --> 01:54:01,510
One big, damn conspiracy!

1499
01:54:01,780 --> 01:54:03,770
And everyone's in on it!

1500
01:54:04,420 --> 01:54:05,580
Including her!

1501
01:54:40,620 --> 01:54:42,310
In 1966...

1502
01:54:42,520 --> 01:54:44,920
... Andy Dufresne escaped...

1503
01:54:45,120 --> 01:54:46,680
... from Shawshank Prison.

1504
01:54:48,930 --> 01:54:51,490
All they found
was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1505
01:54:52,130 --> 01:54:53,650
... a bar of soap...

1506
01:54:53,870 --> 01:54:55,420
... and an old rock hammer...

1507
01:54:55,630 --> 01:54:58,100
... damn near worn down to the nub.

1508
01:55:02,610 --> 01:55:07,370
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it.

1509
01:55:08,010 --> 01:55:10,640
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1510
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:31,230
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1511
01:55:32,000 --> 01:55:35,170
I imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature.

1512
01:55:35,570 --> 01:55:37,400
An ice age here...

1513
01:55:37,840 --> 01:55:40,330
... million years
of mountain building there.

1514
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:44,180
Geology is the study
of pressure and time.

1515
01:55:45,020 --> 01:55:47,010
That's all it takes, really.

1516
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:48,840
Pressure...

1517
01:55:49,490 --> 01:55:50,750
... and time.

1518
01:55:52,090 --> 01:55:54,150
That and a big goddamn poster.

1519
01:55:58,200 --> 01:55:59,130
Like I said...

1520
01:55:59,630 --> 01:56:03,620
... in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1521
01:56:06,440 --> 01:56:11,240
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1522
01:56:11,780 --> 01:56:13,710
... a handful at a time.

1523
01:56:15,010 --> 01:56:17,070
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1524
01:56:17,280 --> 01:56:20,250
... Andy decided
he'd been here long enough.

1525
01:56:20,450 --> 01:56:23,010
Lickety-split.
I want to get home.

1526
01:56:23,750 --> 01:56:25,780
I'm just about finished, sir.

1527
01:56:47,240 --> 01:56:49,180
Three deposits tonight.

1528
01:56:56,490 --> 01:56:58,790
Andy did like he was told.

1529
01:56:58,990 --> 01:57:02,480
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

1530
01:57:06,160 --> 01:57:08,460
The guards simply didn't notice.

1531
01:57:08,770 --> 01:57:10,230
Neither did I.

1532
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:11,960
I mean, seriously...

1533
01:57:12,170 --> 01:57:15,160
... how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

1534
01:59:18,730 --> 01:59:21,890
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1535
01:59:22,130 --> 01:59:25,470
... of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.

1536
01:59:26,470 --> 01:59:28,800
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1537
01:59:33,210 --> 01:59:35,580
Five hundred yards.

1538
01:59:36,080 --> 01:59:39,140
That's the length
of five football fields.

1539
01:59:39,780 --> 01:59:42,340
Just shy of half a mile.

1540
02:00:37,580 --> 02:00:42,170
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

1541
02:00:42,480 --> 02:00:45,310
... a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

1542
02:00:45,550 --> 02:00:48,140
... strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

1543
02:00:48,720 --> 02:00:51,880
Until that moment,
he didn't exist.

1544
02:00:52,460 --> 02:00:54,820
- Except on paper.
- May I help you?

1545
02:00:55,230 --> 02:00:57,160
He had all the proper ID...

1546
02:00:57,360 --> 02:01:01,060
... driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card...

1547
02:01:01,500 --> 02:01:04,020
And the signature
was a spot-on match.

1548
02:01:04,240 --> 02:01:07,330
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1549
02:01:07,540 --> 02:01:09,270
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1550
02:01:10,070 --> 02:01:11,170
Thank you.

1551
02:01:11,840 --> 02:01:13,000
I'm sure I will.

1552
02:01:13,910 --> 02:01:17,240
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1553
02:01:17,450 --> 02:01:18,440
Please.

1554
02:01:19,020 --> 02:01:21,510
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1555
02:01:22,020 --> 02:01:23,210
I'd be happy to.

1556
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:26,350
Good day, sir.

1557
02:01:27,290 --> 02:01:31,730
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1558
02:01:32,200 --> 02:01:33,790
All told, he blew town...

1559
02:01:34,000 --> 02:01:38,830
... with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1560
02:01:39,540 --> 02:01:42,300
Severance pay for 19 years.

1561
02:01:49,550 --> 02:01:51,740
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1562
02:02:44,600 --> 02:02:47,540
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1563
02:02:47,810 --> 02:02:52,240
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1564
02:02:52,680 --> 02:02:57,140
I wasn't there to see, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1565
02:02:57,350 --> 02:02:58,840
... when they took him away.

1566
02:03:04,720 --> 02:03:08,120
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1567
02:03:23,970 --> 02:03:24,800
Samuel Norton.

1568
02:03:25,610 --> 02:03:28,040
We have a warrant
for your arrest. Open up.

1569
02:03:32,780 --> 02:03:33,880
Open the door.

1570
02:03:34,420 --> 02:03:35,680
I'm not sure which key.

1571
02:03:45,830 --> 02:03:47,760
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1572
02:03:59,280 --> 02:04:02,730
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1573
02:04:02,950 --> 02:04:04,540
... other than that bullet...

1574
02:04:04,750 --> 02:04:09,190
... was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1575
02:04:11,690 --> 02:04:15,150
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1576
02:04:15,430 --> 02:04:17,490
... I got a postcard in the mail.

1577
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:21,800
It was blank,
but the postmark said...

1578
02:04:22,000 --> 02:04:24,130
... Fort Hancock, Texas.

1579
02:04:24,670 --> 02:04:26,030
Fort Hancock...

1580
02:04:26,300 --> 02:04:28,030
... right on the border.

1581
02:04:28,440 --> 02:04:30,430
That's where Andy crossed.

1582
02:04:31,010 --> 02:04:35,140
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1583
02:04:35,480 --> 02:04:37,710
... it always makes me laugh.

1584
02:04:39,550 --> 02:04:41,110
Andy Dufresne...

1585
02:04:41,490 --> 02:04:43,510
... who crawled through
a river of shit...

1586
02:04:43,720 --> 02:04:46,120
... and came out clean
on the other side.

1587
02:04:46,960 --> 02:04:48,320
Andy Dufresne...

1588
02:04:49,130 --> 02:04:50,720
... headed for the Pacific.

1589
02:04:53,700 --> 02:04:55,860
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1590
02:04:56,070 --> 02:04:59,870
He says, " I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1591
02:05:00,070 --> 02:05:02,940
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1592
02:05:03,610 --> 02:05:05,300
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1593
02:05:05,510 --> 02:05:08,480
"My friends could use
a couple of beers."

1594
02:05:08,810 --> 02:05:10,470
And he got it!

1595
02:05:11,720 --> 02:05:14,120
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1596
02:05:14,380 --> 02:05:15,820
... Andy being gone.

1597
02:05:16,520 --> 02:05:20,650
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1598
02:05:21,120 --> 02:05:23,180
Their feathers are just too bright.

1599
02:05:24,900 --> 02:05:26,620
And when they fly away...

1600
02:05:27,060 --> 02:05:31,470
... the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1601
02:05:32,540 --> 02:05:33,800
But still...

1602
02:05:34,270 --> 02:05:38,610
... the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1603
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:45,180
I guess I just miss my friend.

1604
02:06:09,870 --> 02:06:10,810
Please sit down.

1605
02:06:16,650 --> 02:06:18,210
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1606
02:06:18,750 --> 02:06:22,010
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1607
02:06:22,820 --> 02:06:24,950
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1608
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:28,380
Rehabilitated?

1609
02:06:30,430 --> 02:06:32,330
Well, now, let me see.

1610
02:06:33,330 --> 02:06:35,660
I don't have any idea
what that means.

1611
02:06:37,770 --> 02:06:40,030
It means you're ready
to rejoin society...

1612
02:06:40,600 --> 02:06:42,940
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1613
02:06:45,110 --> 02:06:47,100
To me it's just a made-up word.

1614
02:06:48,450 --> 02:06:50,780
A politician's word so that...

1615
02:06:51,210 --> 02:06:54,740
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1616
02:06:55,220 --> 02:06:56,810
...and have a job.

1617
02:06:58,790 --> 02:07:00,880
What do you really want to know?

1618
02:07:01,660 --> 02:07:03,630
Am I sorry for what I did?

1619
02:07:04,060 --> 02:07:05,220
Well, are you?

1620
02:07:07,130 --> 02:07:09,960
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1621
02:07:11,340 --> 02:07:14,790
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1622
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:20,840
I look back on the way I was then...

1623
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:24,140
...a young...

1624
02:07:25,250 --> 02:07:28,740
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1625
02:07:31,760 --> 02:07:33,450
I want to talk to him.

1626
02:07:35,390 --> 02:07:37,860
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1627
02:07:38,600 --> 02:07:40,530
Tell him the way things are.

1628
02:07:42,630 --> 02:07:44,070
But I can't.

1629
02:07:46,270 --> 02:07:48,260
That kid's long gone...

1630
02:07:49,470 --> 02:07:52,240
...and this old man is all that's left.

1631
02:07:53,640 --> 02:07:55,110
I got to live with that.

1632
02:07:56,480 --> 02:07:58,180
Rehabilitated?

1633
02:07:58,550 --> 02:08:00,380
It's just a bullshit word.

1634
02:08:01,320 --> 02:08:06,090
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1635
02:08:07,320 --> 02:08:09,590
Because to tell you the truth...

1636
02:08:09,930 --> 02:08:11,920
...I don't give a shit.

1637
02:09:38,450 --> 02:09:39,850
Here you go, miss.

1638
02:09:42,790 --> 02:09:43,810
Restroom break?

1639
02:09:49,630 --> 02:09:54,150
You don't need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1640
02:10:07,210 --> 02:10:10,270
Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.

1641
02:10:11,110 --> 02:10:14,110
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1642
02:10:17,620 --> 02:10:19,780
There's a harsh truth to face.

1643
02:10:21,460 --> 02:10:24,360
No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.

1644
02:10:32,240 --> 02:10:35,930
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1645
02:10:36,740 --> 02:10:39,210
... so maybe they'd send me back.

1646
02:10:44,410 --> 02:10:46,850
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1647
02:10:47,750 --> 02:10:49,410
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1648
02:10:49,620 --> 02:10:51,550
Knew it all too well.

1649
02:10:53,160 --> 02:10:56,560
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1650
02:10:56,990 --> 02:10:59,720
Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.

1651
02:11:01,730 --> 02:11:04,100
Only one thing stops me.

1652
02:11:05,540 --> 02:11:07,940
A promise I made to Andy.

1653
02:11:28,460 --> 02:11:29,580
There it is.

1654
02:11:40,200 --> 02:11:41,860
Much obliged, sir.

1655
02:15:21,190 --> 02:15:22,450
Dear Red:

1656
02:15:22,690 --> 02:15:25,160
If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...

1657
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:29,420
... and if you've come this far,
maybe you'd come a bit further.

1658
02:15:29,700 --> 02:15:32,170
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1659
02:15:34,470 --> 02:15:35,960
Zihuatanejo.

1660
02:15:37,610 --> 02:15:41,200
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1661
02:15:41,710 --> 02:15:45,240
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1662
02:15:46,050 --> 02:15:47,450
Remember, Red...

1663
02:15:47,780 --> 02:15:49,880
... hope is a good thing...

1664
02:15:50,090 --> 02:15:52,080
... maybe the best of things.

1665
02:15:52,290 --> 02:15:54,450
And no good thing ever dies.

1666
02:15:54,990 --> 02:15:57,860
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1667
02:15:58,060 --> 02:15:59,790
... and finds you well.

1668
02:16:00,300 --> 02:16:01,520
Your friend...

1669
02:16:01,730 --> 02:16:02,890
... Andy.

1670
02:16:36,730 --> 02:16:38,460
"Get busy living...

1671
02:16:38,670 --> 02:16:40,570
... or get busy dying. "

1672
02:16:43,270 --> 02:16:45,430
That's goddamn right.

1673
02:16:50,680 --> 02:16:52,810
For the second time in my life...

1674
02:16:53,050 --> 02:16:55,610
... I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1675
02:16:56,690 --> 02:16:58,620
Parole violation.

1676
02:16:59,290 --> 02:17:02,950
Of course I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1677
02:17:03,630 --> 02:17:05,650
Not for an old crook like me.

1678
02:17:05,860 --> 02:17:07,890
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1679
02:17:11,570 --> 02:17:16,300
I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1680
02:17:16,740 --> 02:17:20,070
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1681
02:17:20,280 --> 02:17:22,770
A free man at the start
of a long journey...

1682
02:17:22,980 --> 02:17:25,570
... whose conclusion is uncertain.

1683
02:17:28,590 --> 02:17:31,250
I hope I can make it across the border.

1684
02:17:32,760 --> 02:17:35,780
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1685
02:17:37,660 --> 02:17:41,720
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1686
02:17:43,570 --> 02:17:44,760
I hope.
