1
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,578
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:02:06,779 --> 00:02:11,113
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:15,788 --> 00:02:17,449
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,124
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:23,663 --> 00:02:27,155
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,063
- What was your response?
- I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,433
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno."

8
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,973
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:39,045 --> 00:02:40,672
If they say so.

10
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,705
I really don't remember.
I was upset.

11
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:46,417
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:47,587 --> 00:02:49,350
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:50,523 --> 00:02:53,686
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:58,423
Glenn Quentin, golf pro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:58,631 --> 00:03:01,759
... whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.

16
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:05,264
Did you follow her?

17
00:03:06,606 --> 00:03:08,699
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:03:08,908 --> 00:03:13,277
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:15,370
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:16,082 --> 00:03:17,071
... and waited.

21
00:03:17,283 --> 00:03:18,944
With what intention?

22
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:20,985
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:23,588
I was confused...

24
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,848
... drunk.

25
00:03:26,359 --> 00:03:27,656
I think...

26
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,953
... mostly I wanted to scare them.

27
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:33,597
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:35,899
I was sobering up.

29
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:39,765
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:39,972 --> 00:03:42,941
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:43,142 --> 00:03:45,133
I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:49,439
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:52,243
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:52,451 --> 00:03:54,544
...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:55,922 --> 00:04:00,120
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:04:01,027 --> 00:04:02,016
Yes, it does.

37
00:04:02,228 --> 00:04:05,391
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:04:05,598 --> 00:04:07,657
...before the murders took place.

39
00:04:07,867 --> 00:04:10,097
That's very convenient.

40
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:11,964
It's the truth.

41
00:04:12,338 --> 00:04:16,900
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:04:17,109 --> 00:04:21,205
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:04:21,414 --> 00:04:24,850
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:27,918
And that also...

45
00:04:28,387 --> 00:04:31,823
...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:35,218
Since I am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:35,428 --> 00:04:40,058
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,317
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
all the evidence.

49
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,354
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

50
00:05:05,558 --> 00:05:08,425
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

51
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:11,597
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

52
00:05:11,797 --> 00:05:13,355
And most of all...

53
00:05:13,566 --> 00:05:16,626
... we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

54
00:05:16,836 --> 00:05:18,861
... lying dead in each other's arms.

55
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:22,667
They had sinned.

56
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:26,401
But was their crime so great...

57
00:05:26,679 --> 00:05:28,874
... as to merit a death sentence?

58
00:05:29,081 --> 00:05:31,379
While you think about that...

59
00:05:32,818 --> 00:05:34,615
...think about this:

60
00:05:35,488 --> 00:05:39,219
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:43,122
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:43,329 --> 00:05:46,127
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:46,332 --> 00:05:47,356
No.

64
00:05:47,566 --> 00:05:48,692
This was revenge...

65
00:05:48,901 --> 00:05:53,338
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:55,939
Four bullets per victim.

67
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,405
Not six shots fired, but eight.

68
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:02,506
That means that he fired
the gun empty...

69
00:06:02,748 --> 00:06:04,682
... and then stopped to reload...

70
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:08,375
... so that he could shoot
each of them again.

71
00:06:08,587 --> 00:06:11,147
An extra bullet per lover...

72
00:06:11,924 --> 00:06:13,687
... right in the head.

73
00:06:17,196 --> 00:06:21,997
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:24,528
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:06:26,472 --> 00:06:29,236
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:33,708
...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,605
...one for each of your victims.
So be it!

78
00:07:01,741 --> 00:07:02,901
Sit.

79
00:07:07,446 --> 00:07:10,279
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:07:11,217 --> 00:07:14,414
- Yes, sir.
- You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:17,414
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:07:18,557 --> 00:07:20,548
I mean, I learned my lesson.

83
00:07:21,627 --> 00:07:25,063
I can honestly say
that I'm a changed man.

84
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,666
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,838
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:08:09,141 --> 00:08:10,438
Hey, Red.

87
00:08:10,643 --> 00:08:11,940
How'd it go?

88
00:08:12,144 --> 00:08:14,305
Same old shit, different day.

89
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,445
Yeah, I know how you feel.

90
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:18,640
I'm up for rejection next week.

91
00:08:19,418 --> 00:08:21,943
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

92
00:08:22,154 --> 00:08:23,451
It happens.

93
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:25,089
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

94
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:28,590
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

95
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:29,795
Four!

96
00:08:30,930 --> 00:08:34,366
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

97
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:36,364
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

98
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:39,663
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

99
00:08:39,872 --> 00:08:43,308
... bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

100
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:45,636
Damn near anything within reason.

101
00:08:45,845 --> 00:08:49,576
Yes, sir!
I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

102
00:08:52,518 --> 00:08:55,453
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

103
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:59,215
... and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

104
00:08:59,425 --> 00:09:01,689
... I told him, "No problem."

105
00:09:43,569 --> 00:09:45,730
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

106
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:49,839
... in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

107
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:54,237
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

108
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:56,477
Good work for a man so young.

109
00:10:39,725 --> 00:10:41,488
You speak English, butt-steak?

110
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:43,559
You follow this officer.

111
00:10:56,308 --> 00:11:00,574
I never seen such a sorry-Iooking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

112
00:11:00,813 --> 00:11:03,407
Hey, fish! Come over here!

113
00:11:26,672 --> 00:11:28,071
Taking bets today, Red?

114
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,135
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

115
00:11:30,342 --> 00:11:32,037
Smokes. Put me down for two.

116
00:11:32,578 --> 00:11:34,136
All right, who's your horse?

117
00:11:34,346 --> 00:11:36,109
That little sack of shit.

118
00:11:37,716 --> 00:11:40,981
- Eighth. He'll be first.
- Bullshit! I'll take that action.

119
00:11:41,186 --> 00:11:43,381
You're out some smokes, son.

120
00:11:43,589 --> 00:11:45,352
If you're so smart, you call it.

121
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:48,651
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

122
00:11:48,861 --> 00:11:51,455
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

123
00:11:54,667 --> 00:11:56,362
Fresh fish today!

124
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:58,603
We're reeling them in!

125
00:11:59,271 --> 00:12:02,934
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

126
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:06,376
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

127
00:12:06,712 --> 00:12:08,839
That was my first impression of the man.

128
00:12:09,048 --> 00:12:10,481
What do you say?

129
00:12:10,683 --> 00:12:13,982
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

130
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:16,313
That guy? Never happen.

131
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:18,786
- 10 cigarettes.
- That's a rich bet.

132
00:12:18,991 --> 00:12:21,050
Who's going to prove me wrong?

133
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,057
Heywood? Jigger?

134
00:12:23,362 --> 00:12:24,659
Skeets?

135
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:26,194
Floyd!

136
00:12:27,132 --> 00:12:29,191
Four brave souls.

137
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,165
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

138
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:35,670
All prisoners,
return to your cellblocks.

139
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:57,187
Turn to the right!

140
00:12:57,396 --> 00:12:58,693
Eyes front.

141
00:13:11,777 --> 00:13:14,371
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

142
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:16,673
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

143
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:19,077
You are convicted felons.

144
00:13:19,385 --> 00:13:21,376
That's why they've sent you to me.

145
00:13:21,954 --> 00:13:23,353
Rule number one:

146
00:13:23,555 --> 00:13:25,045
No blasphemy.

147
00:13:25,557 --> 00:13:28,993
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

148
00:13:29,194 --> 00:13:30,388
The other rules...

149
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:33,895
...you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

150
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:35,324
When do we eat?

151
00:13:44,009 --> 00:13:46,034
You eat when we say you eat.

152
00:13:46,245 --> 00:13:49,510
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

153
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:52,548
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

154
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:55,785
On your feet.

155
00:13:55,988 --> 00:13:57,751
I believe in two things:

156
00:13:57,956 --> 00:14:00,424
Discipline and the Bible.

157
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:02,985
Here, you'll receive both.

158
00:14:03,762 --> 00:14:05,923
Put your trust in the Lord.

159
00:14:06,498 --> 00:14:08,762
Your ass belongs to me.

160
00:14:10,602 --> 00:14:12,502
Welcome to Shawshank.

161
00:14:17,676 --> 00:14:19,041
Unhook them.

162
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:25,849
Turn around.

163
00:14:32,691 --> 00:14:34,124
That's enough.

164
00:14:35,027 --> 00:14:37,018
Move to the end of the cage.

165
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:40,555
Turn around. Delouse him.

166
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:43,963
Turn around.

167
00:14:46,805 --> 00:14:49,501
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

168
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,039
Next man up!

169
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:54,778
To the right.

170
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,038
Right. Right.

171
00:14:56,615 --> 00:14:57,843
Left.

172
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:02,050
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

173
00:15:02,488 --> 00:15:05,616
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

174
00:15:05,824 --> 00:15:09,624
... skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

175
00:15:10,295 --> 00:15:12,695
And when they put you in that cell...

176
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:15,230
... and those bars slam home...

177
00:15:15,701 --> 00:15:17,896
... that's when you know it's for real.

178
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:21,506
Old life blown away
in the blink of an eye.

179
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:26,103
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

180
00:15:27,179 --> 00:15:30,580
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

181
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,851
Somebody always breaks down crying.

182
00:15:34,353 --> 00:15:36,014
Happens every time.

183
00:15:36,922 --> 00:15:38,719
The only question is...

184
00:15:38,924 --> 00:15:40,687
... who's it going to be?

185
00:15:42,094 --> 00:15:45,029
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

186
00:15:46,098 --> 00:15:48,760
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

187
00:15:57,776 --> 00:15:59,437
Lights out!

188
00:16:19,965 --> 00:16:22,297
I remember my first night.

189
00:16:23,135 --> 00:16:26,070
Seems like a long time ago.

190
00:16:29,308 --> 00:16:30,900
Hey, fish.

191
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:33,741
Fish, fish.

192
00:16:35,314 --> 00:16:37,077
What are you, scared of the dark?

193
00:16:39,418 --> 00:16:42,114
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

194
00:16:42,321 --> 00:16:45,757
Piggy! Pork!
I want me a pork chop.

195
00:16:54,099 --> 00:16:57,330
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

196
00:16:57,669 --> 00:17:00,604
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

197
00:17:02,007 --> 00:17:03,599
Hey, Fat Ass.

198
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,441
Fat Ass!

199
00:17:07,613 --> 00:17:09,342
Talk to me, boy.

200
00:17:10,349 --> 00:17:12,749
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

201
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:15,920
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

202
00:17:16,121 --> 00:17:18,021
This place ain't so bad.

203
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:19,685
Tell you what...

204
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:24,053
...I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

205
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:27,622
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

206
00:17:27,866 --> 00:17:29,800
...Iove to make your acquaintance.

207
00:17:30,002 --> 00:17:33,494
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

208
00:17:33,705 --> 00:17:34,797
God!

209
00:17:35,474 --> 00:17:36,873
I don't belong here!

210
00:17:37,075 --> 00:17:39,908
- We have a winner!
- I want to go home!

211
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:42,840
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

212
00:17:45,651 --> 00:17:47,380
Fresh fish!

213
00:17:53,492 --> 00:17:55,323
I want to go home!

214
00:17:56,294 --> 00:17:57,522
I want my mother!

215
00:17:57,796 --> 00:17:59,957
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

216
00:18:04,336 --> 00:18:06,327
What the Christ is this horseshit?

217
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:08,631
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

218
00:18:08,840 --> 00:18:11,240
You'll tell him
with my baton up your ass!

219
00:18:11,443 --> 00:18:12,273
Let me out!

220
00:18:12,477 --> 00:18:15,878
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

221
00:18:16,081 --> 00:18:19,073
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

222
00:18:19,584 --> 00:18:20,642
Not me!

223
00:18:20,852 --> 00:18:23,184
I won't count to three.
Not even to one.

224
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:25,447
You shut up,
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

225
00:18:25,924 --> 00:18:28,654
Shut up, man. Shut up!

226
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:32,056
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

227
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:33,561
Open that cell.

228
00:18:33,765 --> 00:18:37,030
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

229
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:46,537
Son of a bitch!

230
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:53,782
Captain, take it easy!

231
00:19:16,174 --> 00:19:19,439
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

232
00:19:19,644 --> 00:19:23,080
...I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

233
00:19:23,582 --> 00:19:25,914
Every last motherfucker in here.

234
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:32,984
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

235
00:19:47,339 --> 00:19:51,969
His first night in the joint, Dufresne
cost me two packs of cigarettes.

236
00:19:52,177 --> 00:19:55,169
He never made a sound.

237
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:12,861
Tier 3 north, clear count!

238
00:20:13,765 --> 00:20:15,596
Tier 2 north, clear count.

239
00:20:16,101 --> 00:20:18,467
Tier 3 south, clear.

240
00:20:23,308 --> 00:20:24,866
Prepare to roll out.

241
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,970
Roll out!

242
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:26,063
Are you going to eat that?

243
00:21:26,705 --> 00:21:29,003
I hadn't planned on it.

244
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:31,303
Do you mind?

245
00:21:39,885 --> 00:21:41,284
That's nice and ripe.

246
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:55,090
Jake says thank you.

247
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,763
Fell out of his nest
over by the plate shop.

248
00:22:00,205 --> 00:22:03,572
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

249
00:22:05,043 --> 00:22:06,510
Oh, no! Here he comes.

250
00:22:09,848 --> 00:22:11,281
Morning, fellas.

251
00:22:11,516 --> 00:22:13,450
Fine morning, isn't it?

252
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:16,015
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

253
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:18,518
Send them down.
I want them lined up...

254
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:21,350
...just like a pretty little
chorus line.

255
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,654
Look at that.

256
00:22:24,195 --> 00:22:27,358
- I can't stand this guy.
- Oh, Lord!

257
00:22:28,033 --> 00:22:30,501
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

258
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:32,067
Smell my ass!

259
00:22:32,270 --> 00:22:34,261
After he smells mine.

260
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:38,403
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

261
00:22:38,610 --> 00:22:41,443
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

262
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:44,171
I owe that boy a big kiss
when I see him.

263
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:49,048
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

264
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:50,879
Hey, Tyrell.

265
00:22:51,222 --> 00:22:53,213
You pull infirmary duty this week?

266
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:55,751
How's my horse doing anyway?

267
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:57,287
Dead.

268
00:22:58,129 --> 00:23:00,324
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

269
00:23:00,532 --> 00:23:02,727
Doc had gone home for the night.

270
00:23:03,234 --> 00:23:05,498
Poor bastard lay there
till this morning.

271
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:08,172
By then, there wasn't nothing
we could do.

272
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:15,776
What was his name?

273
00:23:19,150 --> 00:23:20,412
What'd you say?

274
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,720
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

275
00:23:25,390 --> 00:23:28,154
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

276
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:32,288
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

277
00:23:54,352 --> 00:23:56,343
Anybody come at you yet?

278
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,321
Anybody get to you yet?

279
00:24:01,993 --> 00:24:04,518
Hey, we all need friends in here.

280
00:24:04,829 --> 00:24:06,490
I could be a friend to you.

281
00:24:15,707 --> 00:24:17,106
Hard to get.

282
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:20,700
I like that.

283
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:30,883
Andy kept pretty much
to himself at first.

284
00:24:31,222 --> 00:24:33,190
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

285
00:24:33,625 --> 00:24:36,458
... trying to adapt
to life on the inside.

286
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:40,392
Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

287
00:24:40,598 --> 00:24:42,964
... to say more than two words
to somebody.

288
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:45,727
As it turned out...

289
00:24:46,204 --> 00:24:48,069
... that somebody was me.

290
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:58,611
I'm Andy Dufresne.

291
00:24:59,851 --> 00:25:01,580
Wife-killing banker.

292
00:25:03,822 --> 00:25:05,153
Why'd you do it?

293
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,649
I didn't, since you ask.

294
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:10,090
You're going to fit right in.

295
00:25:10,328 --> 00:25:12,990
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

296
00:25:13,631 --> 00:25:16,828
- What you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

297
00:25:19,871 --> 00:25:22,431
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

298
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,235
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

299
00:25:26,444 --> 00:25:27,911
What do you think?

300
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:31,339
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

301
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:35,282
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

302
00:25:36,254 --> 00:25:39,553
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

303
00:25:39,757 --> 00:25:42,317
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

304
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:44,324
A rock hammer.

305
00:25:44,696 --> 00:25:47,358
- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

306
00:25:48,733 --> 00:25:51,429
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

307
00:25:51,636 --> 00:25:54,070
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

308
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,039
Fair enough.

309
00:25:57,475 --> 00:26:00,103
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

310
00:26:00,311 --> 00:26:02,643
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

311
00:26:02,847 --> 00:26:04,041
For rocks.

312
00:26:06,651 --> 00:26:07,879
Quartz?

313
00:26:11,823 --> 00:26:15,281
And some mica, shale...

314
00:26:16,528 --> 00:26:17,790
...limestone.

315
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:19,155
So?

316
00:26:20,098 --> 00:26:21,929
So I'm a rock hound.

317
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:25,461
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

318
00:26:25,737 --> 00:26:28,865
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

319
00:26:30,341 --> 00:26:31,899
No, I have no enemies here.

320
00:26:32,110 --> 00:26:34,408
No? Wait a while.

321
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:37,639
Word gets around.

322
00:26:38,316 --> 00:26:40,807
The Sisters have taken
quite a liking to you.

323
00:26:42,187 --> 00:26:43,984
Especially Bogs.

324
00:26:44,989 --> 00:26:48,425
Don't suppose it would help if I
told them I'm not homosexual.

325
00:26:48,626 --> 00:26:50,059
Neither are they.

326
00:26:50,261 --> 00:26:53,719
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

327
00:26:58,236 --> 00:27:02,639
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

328
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:06,367
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

329
00:27:06,578 --> 00:27:09,342
- Thanks for the advice.
- Well, that's free.

330
00:27:09,681 --> 00:27:11,649
You understand my concern.

331
00:27:11,849 --> 00:27:14,443
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

332
00:27:15,353 --> 00:27:19,414
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

333
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:21,986
What did I miss?
What's so funny?

334
00:27:22,393 --> 00:27:25,089
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

335
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:29,161
What's an item like this usually go for?

336
00:27:29,367 --> 00:27:31,858
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

337
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:34,838
My normal markup's 20 percent.

338
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,405
But this is a specialty item.

339
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:42,069
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

340
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:43,611
Ten it is.

341
00:27:45,350 --> 00:27:47,375
Waste of money, if you ask me.

342
00:27:47,652 --> 00:27:48,949
Why's that?

343
00:27:50,355 --> 00:27:53,381
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

344
00:27:54,993 --> 00:27:56,961
They find it, you're going to lose it.

345
00:27:57,161 --> 00:27:59,254
If they catch you, you don't know me.

346
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:01,694
Mention my name, we never
do business again.

347
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,294
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

348
00:28:06,137 --> 00:28:07,695
I understand.

349
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:10,999
Thank you, Mr...

350
00:28:11,209 --> 00:28:12,233
Red.

351
00:28:12,977 --> 00:28:14,274
Name's Red.

352
00:28:15,713 --> 00:28:17,340
Why do they call you that?

353
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,110
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

354
00:28:31,296 --> 00:28:34,163
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

355
00:28:35,033 --> 00:28:37,467
He had a quiet way about him...

356
00:28:37,802 --> 00:28:41,966
... a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

357
00:28:42,307 --> 00:28:43,774
He strolled...

358
00:28:43,975 --> 00:28:48,173
... like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

359
00:28:48,379 --> 00:28:53,043
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

360
00:28:54,986 --> 00:28:57,216
I think it'd be fair to say...

361
00:28:57,488 --> 00:28:59,718
... I liked Andy from the start.

362
00:29:01,259 --> 00:29:05,059
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

363
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,890
Move it! Come on, move it!

364
00:29:13,504 --> 00:29:16,439
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

365
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:56,046
Andy was right.

366
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,510
I finally got the joke.

367
00:29:58,816 --> 00:30:01,216
It would take a man about 600 years...

368
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:03,887
... to tunnel under the wall
with one of these.

369
00:30:07,658 --> 00:30:10,092
- Book?
- Not today.

370
00:30:16,134 --> 00:30:17,123
Book?

371
00:30:24,475 --> 00:30:26,636
Delivery for Dufresne.

372
00:30:44,328 --> 00:30:45,920
Here's your book.

373
00:30:50,935 --> 00:30:52,163
Thanks.

374
00:30:58,443 --> 00:31:02,140
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

375
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:41,008
This will blind you.

376
00:31:41,385 --> 00:31:43,785
Honey, hush.

377
00:31:56,334 --> 00:31:58,302
That's it. You fight!

378
00:31:58,503 --> 00:31:59,970
Better that way.

379
00:32:08,212 --> 00:32:11,306
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

380
00:32:11,516 --> 00:32:13,507
... and the Sisters let him be.

381
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:15,916
I wish I could tell you that...

382
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:19,089
... but prison is no fairy-tale world.

383
00:32:20,224 --> 00:32:22,192
He never said who did it.

384
00:32:22,426 --> 00:32:24,018
But we all knew.

385
00:32:28,866 --> 00:32:31,357
Things went on like that for a while.

386
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:34,260
Prison life consists of routine...

387
00:32:34,539 --> 00:32:36,507
... and then more routine.

388
00:32:39,010 --> 00:32:42,537
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

389
00:32:44,015 --> 00:32:45,846
The Sisters kept at him.

390
00:32:46,083 --> 00:32:48,142
Sometimes he was able
to fight them off.

391
00:32:48,352 --> 00:32:49,842
Sometimes not.

392
00:32:51,022 --> 00:32:53,183
And that's how it went for Andy.

393
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:55,521
That was his routine.

394
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:59,796
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

395
00:33:00,298 --> 00:33:03,665
And I also believe that
if things had gone on that way...

396
00:33:04,001 --> 00:33:06,435
... this place would have
got the best of him.

397
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:10,002
But then, in the spring of 1949...

398
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:12,107
... the powers that be decided:

399
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:15,643
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

400
00:33:15,846 --> 00:33:19,043
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

401
00:33:19,750 --> 00:33:21,217
As you know...

402
00:33:21,953 --> 00:33:25,514
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

403
00:33:25,723 --> 00:33:28,123
It was outdoor detail...

404
00:33:28,526 --> 00:33:32,792
... and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

405
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:34,361
Stay in line there.

406
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:37,728
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

407
00:33:42,006 --> 00:33:44,998
Wallace E. Unger.

408
00:33:45,509 --> 00:33:47,875
Ellis Redding.

409
00:33:48,079 --> 00:33:49,637
Wouldn't you know it?

410
00:33:50,081 --> 00:33:53,380
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

411
00:33:53,584 --> 00:33:55,575
Andrew Dufresne.

412
00:33:55,987 --> 00:33:58,922
It only cost us
a pack of smokes per man.

413
00:33:59,423 --> 00:34:01,891
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

414
00:34:02,093 --> 00:34:05,551
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

415
00:34:05,763 --> 00:34:07,321
I say, "Yeah?"

416
00:34:07,598 --> 00:34:11,227
He says, " Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

417
00:34:11,435 --> 00:34:15,337
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I'm not. He was an asshole.

418
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:17,734
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

419
00:34:17,942 --> 00:34:20,240
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

420
00:34:20,444 --> 00:34:24,574
"He died a rich man." Oil wells
and shit. Close to a million bucks.

421
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:27,114
A million bucks?

422
00:34:27,418 --> 00:34:31,912
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
- You going to see any of that?

423
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:35,287
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

424
00:34:35,493 --> 00:34:36,687
Dollars?

425
00:34:37,428 --> 00:34:40,420
That's great! That's like
winning the sweepstakes.

426
00:34:40,765 --> 00:34:41,857
Isn't it?

427
00:34:42,066 --> 00:34:45,035
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

428
00:34:45,236 --> 00:34:47,602
Take a big wet bite
out of my ass is what.

429
00:34:48,372 --> 00:34:49,703
Poor Byron.

430
00:34:50,608 --> 00:34:53,771
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

431
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:56,242
Some people really got it awful.

432
00:34:56,514 --> 00:34:57,879
Andy, are you nuts?

433
00:34:58,082 --> 00:34:59,982
IKeep your eyes on your mop, man!

434
00:35:00,184 --> 00:35:03,153
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

435
00:35:03,354 --> 00:35:06,152
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

436
00:35:06,357 --> 00:35:08,518
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

437
00:35:08,759 --> 00:35:12,490
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

438
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:16,393
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

439
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,727
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

440
00:35:18,969 --> 00:35:22,962
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

441
00:35:25,609 --> 00:35:27,770
- Getting himself killed.
- IKeep tarring.

442
00:35:28,012 --> 00:35:30,537
Some brother.
Shit!

443
00:35:35,486 --> 00:35:36,885
Mr. Hadley...

444
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:39,120
...do you trust your wife?

445
00:35:40,758 --> 00:35:42,225
Oh, that's funny.

446
00:35:42,760 --> 00:35:45,354
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

447
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:48,929
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?
Try to hamstring you?

448
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:53,434
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

449
00:35:53,671 --> 00:35:54,695
He'll push him off!

450
00:35:54,939 --> 00:35:56,770
If you trust her, you can keep...

451
00:35:57,007 --> 00:35:58,406
...that 35,000.

452
00:35:59,143 --> 00:36:01,634
- What did you say?
- Thirty-five thousand.

453
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,504
All of it.

454
00:36:03,714 --> 00:36:06,774
- Every penny.
- You better start making sense.

455
00:36:06,984 --> 00:36:09,316
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

456
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:13,422
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $ 60,000.

457
00:36:13,624 --> 00:36:15,990
- Bullshit. Tax-free?
- Tax-free.

458
00:36:16,193 --> 00:36:18,161
IRS can't touch one cent.

459
00:36:18,562 --> 00:36:21,030
You're that smart banker
that killed his wife.

460
00:36:21,265 --> 00:36:24,632
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

461
00:36:24,835 --> 00:36:27,668
It's legal. Ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

462
00:36:27,872 --> 00:36:31,933
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

463
00:36:32,143 --> 00:36:35,806
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

464
00:36:36,013 --> 00:36:39,414
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

465
00:36:39,617 --> 00:36:41,175
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

466
00:36:41,385 --> 00:36:43,649
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

467
00:36:44,121 --> 00:36:47,579
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

468
00:36:47,792 --> 00:36:49,851
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

469
00:36:50,094 --> 00:36:51,823
...nearly free of charge.

470
00:36:53,063 --> 00:36:56,362
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

471
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:58,858
"Coworkers." That's rich!

472
00:36:59,703 --> 00:37:02,228
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

473
00:37:02,439 --> 00:37:05,897
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

474
00:37:06,343 --> 00:37:07,332
...sir.

475
00:37:11,282 --> 00:37:13,216
What are you jimmies staring at?

476
00:37:13,417 --> 00:37:15,009
Let's go! Work!

477
00:37:24,528 --> 00:37:26,462
And that's how it came to pass...

478
00:37:26,664 --> 00:37:29,326
... that on the second-to-last
day of the job...

479
00:37:29,533 --> 00:37:34,095
... the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

480
00:37:34,305 --> 00:37:37,433
... wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

481
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:43,102
... drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

482
00:37:43,314 --> 00:37:46,579
... that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

483
00:37:46,784 --> 00:37:49,218
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

484
00:37:50,321 --> 00:37:54,883
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

485
00:37:56,026 --> 00:38:00,486
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

486
00:38:00,865 --> 00:38:04,301
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

487
00:38:04,501 --> 00:38:07,334
We were the lords of all creation.

488
00:38:07,905 --> 00:38:09,497
As for Andy...

489
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,368
... he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

490
00:38:12,576 --> 00:38:15,067
... a strange little smile on his face...

491
00:38:15,312 --> 00:38:17,507
... watching us drink his beer.

492
00:38:25,623 --> 00:38:26,988
Want a cold one?

493
00:38:27,658 --> 00:38:30,593
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

494
00:38:34,565 --> 00:38:37,625
You could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards.

495
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:42,135
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

496
00:38:42,873 --> 00:38:43,931
Me?

497
00:38:44,141 --> 00:38:46,939
I think he did it
just to feel normal again...

498
00:38:47,378 --> 00:38:49,608
... if only for a short while.

499
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:53,341
IKing me.

500
00:38:55,219 --> 00:38:57,847
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
- What?

501
00:38:58,055 --> 00:38:59,784
Civilized. Strategic.

502
00:39:00,457 --> 00:39:03,449
And a total fucking mystery.
I hate it.

503
00:39:03,727 --> 00:39:05,490
Let me teach you someday.

504
00:39:07,064 --> 00:39:08,031
Sure.

505
00:39:08,499 --> 00:39:10,228
We could get a board together.

506
00:39:10,467 --> 00:39:13,527
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

507
00:39:13,737 --> 00:39:17,730
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

508
00:39:17,942 --> 00:39:21,241
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

509
00:39:21,845 --> 00:39:23,244
I think it'll take years.

510
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:25,972
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

511
00:39:26,183 --> 00:39:28,151
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

512
00:39:28,352 --> 00:39:30,183
Pebbles, mostly.

513
00:39:34,525 --> 00:39:37,323
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

514
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:39,753
Yeah, I guess.

515
00:39:40,397 --> 00:39:41,921
Can I ask you something?

516
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:44,833
Why'd you do it?

517
00:39:46,070 --> 00:39:47,628
I'm innocent, Red.

518
00:39:47,838 --> 00:39:49,863
Just like everybody else here.

519
00:39:54,211 --> 00:39:55,769
What are you in for?

520
00:39:58,482 --> 00:40:00,643
Murder. Same as you.

521
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:02,011
Innocent?

522
00:40:04,722 --> 00:40:07,122
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

523
00:41:06,450 --> 00:41:07,940
Where's the canary?

524
00:41:08,152 --> 00:41:09,449
How did you know?

525
00:41:09,653 --> 00:41:11,951
- How did I know what?
- So you don't know.

526
00:41:12,156 --> 00:41:13,316
Come.

527
00:41:15,826 --> 00:41:17,919
This is where the canary is.

528
00:41:20,597 --> 00:41:23,930
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

529
00:41:27,438 --> 00:41:28,837
That's quite a...

530
00:41:29,773 --> 00:41:31,434
... surprise.

531
00:41:35,746 --> 00:41:37,145
Wait, wait.

532
00:41:37,681 --> 00:41:39,171
Here she comes.

533
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:42,317
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

534
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:45,249
I know. I've seen it
three times this month.

535
00:41:45,456 --> 00:41:47,356
Gilda, are you decent?

536
00:41:48,358 --> 00:41:49,484
Me?
537
00:41:52,196 --> 00:41:53,959
God, I love it.

538
00:41:59,136 --> 00:42:02,128
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

539
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:06,871
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

540
00:42:07,077 --> 00:42:09,204
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

541
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:11,145
Can you get her?

542
00:42:12,549 --> 00:42:15,916
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

543
00:42:17,154 --> 00:42:19,452
- Take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

544
00:42:19,656 --> 00:42:24,059
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

545
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:25,959
But I'll get her.

546
00:42:26,163 --> 00:42:27,494
Relax.

547
00:42:29,366 --> 00:42:30,663
Thanks.

548
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:53,018
- Get out!
- I got to change reels!

549
00:42:53,257 --> 00:42:55,248
I said fuck off!

550
00:43:01,398 --> 00:43:02,763
Ain't you going to scream?

551
00:43:04,101 --> 00:43:05,966
Let's get this over with.

552
00:43:11,074 --> 00:43:13,065
He broke my fucking nose!

553
00:43:22,386 --> 00:43:23,614
Now...

554
00:43:24,087 --> 00:43:26,248
...I'm going to open my fly...

555
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:29,287
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

556
00:43:30,427 --> 00:43:33,021
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

557
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:35,357
He ought to have
something to show for it.

558
00:43:35,566 --> 00:43:37,431
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

559
00:43:37,634 --> 00:43:40,228
No, you don't understand.

560
00:43:40,571 --> 00:43:43,597
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

561
00:43:43,807 --> 00:43:47,265
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

562
00:43:47,477 --> 00:43:49,411
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

563
00:43:49,613 --> 00:43:53,105
In fact, I hear the bite reflex
is so strong...

564
00:43:53,917 --> 00:43:56,385
...they have to pry
the victim's jaws open...

565
00:43:56,587 --> 00:43:57,952
...with a crowbar.

566
00:44:00,924 --> 00:44:02,448
Where do you get this shit?

567
00:44:02,659 --> 00:44:04,058
I read it.

568
00:44:05,462 --> 00:44:08,124daban
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

569
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:10,892
Honey!

570
00:44:12,836 --> 00:44:14,565
You shouldn't!

571
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:20,142
Bogs didn't put anything
in Andy's mouth.

572
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,469
And neither did his friends.

573
00:44:22,913 --> 00:44:26,747
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

574
00:44:27,417 --> 00:44:29,908
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

575
00:44:30,721 --> 00:44:33,246
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

576
00:44:37,327 --> 00:44:38,851
Time's up, Bogs.

577
00:44:42,666 --> 00:44:44,327
It's your world, boss.

578
00:44:47,604 --> 00:44:50,402
Return to your cellblocks
for evening count.

579
00:44:50,607 --> 00:44:53,269
All prisoners report for lock down.

580
00:45:08,191 --> 00:45:09,215
What?

581
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:24,397
- Where's he going?
- Grab his ankles.

582
00:45:30,213 --> 00:45:31,475
Help!

583
00:45:35,152 --> 00:45:37,746
Two things never happened again
after that.

584
00:45:38,021 --> 00:45:41,149
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

585
00:45:41,992 --> 00:45:44,483
And Bogs would never walk again.

586
00:45:45,662 --> 00:45:49,154
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

587
00:45:49,366 --> 00:45:52,130
To my knowledge, he lived out
the rest of his days...

588
00:45:52,336 --> 00:45:54,167
... drinking his food through a straw.

589
00:45:55,172 --> 00:45:59,268
Andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary.

590
00:46:01,011 --> 00:46:02,569
Sounds good to us.

591
00:46:02,846 --> 00:46:05,337
I figure we owe him that much
for the beer.

592
00:46:06,083 --> 00:46:08,347
The man likes to play chess.

593
00:46:08,852 --> 00:46:10,752
Let's get him some rocks.

594
00:46:43,387 --> 00:46:44,615
Guys!

595
00:46:45,389 --> 00:46:46,447
I got one.

596
00:46:46,656 --> 00:46:48,146
I got one. Look!

597
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:54,121
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

598
00:46:54,331 --> 00:46:56,231
What are you, a fucking geologist?

599
00:46:56,433 --> 00:46:58,162
He's right. It ain't.

600
00:46:58,368 --> 00:47:01,269
- What the hell is it then?
- It's a horse apple.

601
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:04,639
- Bullshit!
- No, horseshit.

602
00:47:04,841 --> 00:47:06,308
Petrified.

603
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:16,512
Damn!

604
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:21,052
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

605
00:47:21,258 --> 00:47:23,249
And by the week Andy
was due back...

606
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:27,157
... we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

607
00:47:27,998 --> 00:47:30,489
Also got a big shipment in that week.

608
00:47:30,767 --> 00:47:31,893
Cigarettes...

609
00:47:32,102 --> 00:47:33,126
... chewing gum...

610
00:47:33,336 --> 00:47:34,803
... sipping whisky...

611
00:47:35,005 --> 00:47:38,406
... playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

612
00:47:38,608 --> 00:47:41,338
And of course, the most important item:

613
00:47:43,213 --> 00:47:45,272
Rita Hayworth herself.

614
00:48:22,385 --> 00:48:24,649
Heads up.
They're tossing cells.

615
00:48:24,855 --> 00:48:27,551
Heads up.
They're tossing cells!

616
00:48:29,159 --> 00:48:30,649
119.

617
00:48:32,496 --> 00:48:34,157
123.

618
00:48:44,608 --> 00:48:45,438
On your feet.

619
00:48:48,078 --> 00:48:49,568
Face the wall.

620
00:49:23,713 --> 00:49:25,613
Turn around and face the warden.

621
00:49:32,222 --> 00:49:34,281
Pleased to see you reading this.

622
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,559
Any favorite passages?

623
00:49:38,428 --> 00:49:40,794
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

624
00:49:40,997 --> 00:49:43,227
...when the master
of the house cometh."

625
00:49:44,367 --> 00:49:46,528
Mark 13:35.

626
00:49:47,270 --> 00:49:49,135
I've always liked that one.

627
00:49:50,073 --> 00:49:51,734
But I prefer...

628
00:49:52,208 --> 00:49:54,073
..." I am the light of the world.

629
00:49:54,544 --> 00:49:57,843
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life."

630
00:49:58,048 --> 00:50:00,676
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

631
00:50:00,951 --> 00:50:02,976
I hear you're good with numbers.

632
00:50:03,186 --> 00:50:04,175
How nice.

633
00:50:05,422 --> 00:50:07,356
Man should have a skill.

634
00:50:09,893 --> 00:50:10,917
Explain this.

635
00:50:12,095 --> 00:50:16,156
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

636
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,500
A little hobby of mine.

637
00:50:29,379 --> 00:50:30,812
It's pretty clean.

638
00:50:31,081 --> 00:50:34,175
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

639
00:50:38,521 --> 00:50:40,512
I can't say I approve of this.

640
00:50:42,158 --> 00:50:43,625
But I suppose...

641
00:50:45,695 --> 00:50:47,686
...exceptions can be made.

642
00:50:58,074 --> 00:50:59,405
Lock them up!

643
00:51:02,312 --> 00:51:03,870
I almost forgot.

644
00:51:04,314 --> 00:51:06,475
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

645
00:51:07,217 --> 00:51:09,151
Salvation lies within.

646
00:51:09,352 --> 00:51:10,410
Yes, sir.

647
00:51:18,962 --> 00:51:21,522
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

648
00:51:21,998 --> 00:51:23,226
Truth is...

649
00:51:23,433 --> 00:51:25,901
... Norton wanted to size Andy up.

650
00:51:39,582 --> 00:51:41,914
My wife made that in church group.

651
00:51:44,587 --> 00:51:45,884
Very nice, sir.

652
00:51:47,457 --> 00:51:48,924
You enjoy working the laundry?

653
00:51:50,593 --> 00:51:52,288
No, sir. Not especially.

654
00:51:52,629 --> 00:51:55,063
Perhaps we can find something more...

655
00:51:55,331 --> 00:51:57,765
...befitting a man of your education.

656
00:52:05,842 --> 00:52:07,332
Hey, Jake.
Where's Brooks?

657
00:52:09,179 --> 00:52:11,943
I thought I heard you out here.

658
00:52:12,615 --> 00:52:14,173
I've been reassigned to you.

659
00:52:14,451 --> 00:52:16,783
I know, they told me.

660
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:19,679
Ain't that a kick in the head?

661
00:52:19,889 --> 00:52:22,187
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

662
00:52:22,392 --> 00:52:23,552
Come on.

663
00:52:24,961 --> 00:52:26,690
Well, here she is.

664
00:52:26,896 --> 00:52:28,887
The Shawshank Prison Library.

665
00:52:29,566 --> 00:52:31,557
National Geographics...

666
00:52:32,469 --> 00:52:35,267
...Reader's Digest condensed books...

667
00:52:35,472 --> 00:52:37,064
...and Louis L'Amour.

668
00:52:37,640 --> 00:52:39,471
Look magazine.

669
00:52:39,809 --> 00:52:42,141
Erle Stanley Gardners.

670
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:45,870
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

671
00:52:46,082 --> 00:52:48,744
I enter the names
on this clipboard here.

672
00:52:49,252 --> 00:52:51,982
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

673
00:52:52,722 --> 00:52:55,623
- Any questions?
- How long have you been librarian?

674
00:52:56,826 --> 00:53:00,853
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

675
00:53:02,165 --> 00:53:04,326
And have you ever had an assistant?

676
00:53:04,601 --> 00:53:07,001
No. Not much to it, really.

677
00:53:07,771 --> 00:53:08,999
Why me? Why now?

678
00:53:09,439 --> 00:53:10,736
I don't know.

679
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,966
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

680
00:53:25,221 --> 00:53:27,519
That's him.
That's the one.

681
00:53:35,165 --> 00:53:36,325
I'm Dekins.

682
00:53:36,733 --> 00:53:38,360
I was thinking...

683
00:53:39,035 --> 00:53:42,903
...about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

684
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,277
I see.

685
00:53:53,383 --> 00:53:56,352
Why don't we have a seat
and talk it over.

686
00:53:59,556 --> 00:54:02,525
Do you have a piece of paper
and a pencil?

687
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,167
Thanks.

688
00:54:15,839 --> 00:54:16,897
So...

689
00:54:18,675 --> 00:54:20,404
Mister Dekins...

690
00:54:21,244 --> 00:54:23,337
And then Andy says, " Mr. Dekins...

691
00:54:23,546 --> 00:54:26,538
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

692
00:54:26,749 --> 00:54:27,807
He didn't say that!

693
00:54:28,151 --> 00:54:30,642
As God as my witness!

694
00:54:30,920 --> 00:54:32,649
Dekins blinked for a second...

695
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:35,984
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

696
00:54:36,426 --> 00:54:38,690
- My ass!
- Shook his hand.

697
00:54:38,928 --> 00:54:41,829
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

698
00:54:42,031 --> 00:54:46,297
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

699
00:54:46,502 --> 00:54:49,096
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

700
00:54:49,305 --> 00:54:50,932
Making a few friends?

701
00:54:52,242 --> 00:54:53,903keyi
I wouldn't say "friends."

702
00:54:54,110 --> 00:54:57,944
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

703
00:54:58,147 --> 00:55:00,479
It's a wonderful pet to have.

704
00:55:00,683 --> 00:55:02,480
Got you out of the laundry, though.

705
00:55:03,019 --> 00:55:04,919
It might do more than that.

706
00:55:05,154 --> 00:55:07,850
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

707
00:55:08,057 --> 00:55:10,651
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

708
00:55:12,362 --> 00:55:15,354
How do you expect to do that?
I mean...

709
00:55:15,565 --> 00:55:18,534
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

710
00:55:19,002 --> 00:55:21,061
I'll ask the warden for funds.

711
00:55:21,938 --> 00:55:26,204
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned...

712
00:55:26,442 --> 00:55:28,740
...one immutable, universal truth:

713
00:55:28,978 --> 00:55:30,377
Not one born whose asshole...

714
00:55:30,580 --> 00:55:35,517
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

715
00:55:36,386 --> 00:55:39,287
- The budget's stretched thin as it is.
- I see.

716
00:55:39,489 --> 00:55:42,925
Maybe I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

717
00:55:43,126 --> 00:55:47,222
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

718
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:49,864
More walls, more bars, more guards.

719
00:55:50,066 --> 00:55:52,728
I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

720
00:55:52,936 --> 00:55:55,666
- They can't ignore me forever.
- Sure can.

721
00:55:55,939 --> 00:55:58,601
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

722
00:55:58,908 --> 00:56:01,502
I'll even mail them for you.
How's that?

723
00:56:03,179 --> 00:56:05,977
So Andy started writing
a letter a week...

724
00:56:06,182 --> 00:56:07,774
... just like he said.

725
00:56:11,955 --> 00:56:14,583
And like Norton said...

726
00:56:14,791 --> 00:56:16,258
... Andy got no answers.

727
00:56:24,467 --> 00:56:29,370
The following April, he did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

728
00:56:30,707 --> 00:56:32,971
Year after that, he did them all...

729
00:56:33,209 --> 00:56:35,143
... including the warden's.

730
00:56:36,879 --> 00:56:40,337
Year after that, they
rescheduled the intramural season...

731
00:56:40,550 --> 00:56:42,984
... to coincide with tax season.

732
00:56:44,554 --> 00:56:49,014
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

733
00:56:49,225 --> 00:56:50,556
So Moresby Prison...

734
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:53,024
...issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

735
00:56:53,262 --> 00:56:54,957
Right. The holster too.

736
00:56:55,164 --> 00:56:57,632
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

737
00:56:57,834 --> 00:57:00,860
Yes, sir!
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

738
00:57:01,571 --> 00:57:06,065
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

739
00:57:06,342 --> 00:57:08,810
Could you hand me
a stack of 1040s?

740
00:57:09,012 --> 00:57:13,847
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

741
00:57:15,084 --> 00:57:18,247
And still, he kept
sending those letters.

742
00:57:25,028 --> 00:57:26,052
It's Brooks.

743
00:57:27,196 --> 00:57:28,686
Watch the door.

744
00:57:28,931 --> 00:57:30,262
Please, Brooks.

745
00:57:30,533 --> 00:57:32,330
- Calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

746
00:57:32,769 --> 00:57:35,397
- Stay back, goddamn it!
- What's going on?

747
00:57:35,605 --> 00:57:38,165
One second he's fine,
then out come the knives.

748
00:57:38,374 --> 00:57:40,171
We can talk about this, right?

749
00:57:40,443 --> 00:57:44,174
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

750
00:57:44,447 --> 00:57:46,176
What's he done to you?

751
00:57:46,382 --> 00:57:48,043
It's what they done!

752
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:49,813
I got no choice.

753
00:57:50,286 --> 00:57:52,584
You won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

754
00:57:52,789 --> 00:57:55,257
- Right, Heywood?
- Sure.

755
00:57:55,491 --> 00:57:58,824
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

756
00:57:59,095 --> 00:58:00,187
Right, guys?

757
00:58:01,130 --> 00:58:03,655
So put the knife down.
Look at me.

758
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,130
Put the knife down.

759
00:58:08,071 --> 00:58:10,164
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

760
00:58:10,907 --> 00:58:13,239
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

761
00:58:14,143 --> 00:58:15,610
It's the only way...

762
00:58:15,812 --> 00:58:17,871
...they'd let me stay.

763
00:58:18,147 --> 00:58:20,513
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

764
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:22,809
Put it, put it down.

765
00:58:31,594 --> 00:58:33,084
Take it easy.

766
00:58:33,763 --> 00:58:35,321
You'll be all right.

767
00:58:36,365 --> 00:58:37,957
Him? What about me?

768
00:58:38,167 --> 00:58:40,567
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

769
00:58:40,770 --> 00:58:42,670
You've had worse from shaving.

770
00:58:42,872 --> 00:58:44,965
What did you do to set him off?

771
00:58:45,174 --> 00:58:47,404
Nothing.
I come in here to say farewell.

772
00:58:48,010 --> 00:58:50,672
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

773
00:58:53,015 --> 00:58:55,813
I just don't understand
what happened in there.

774
00:58:56,018 --> 00:58:58,816
Old man's crazy as a rat
in a tin shithouse.

775
00:58:59,021 --> 00:59:00,921
That's enough out of you.

776
00:59:01,124 --> 00:59:03,854
- Heard he had you shitting your pants.
- Fuck you.

777
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:05,321
IKnock it off.

778
00:59:06,295 --> 00:59:07,728
Brooks ain't no bug.

779
00:59:11,567 --> 00:59:13,330
He's just institutionalized.

780
00:59:14,704 --> 00:59:16,638
"Institutionalized," my ass.

781
00:59:16,839 --> 00:59:20,832
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

782
00:59:21,043 --> 00:59:22,772
This is all he knows.

783
00:59:22,979 --> 00:59:25,277
In here, he's an important man...

784
00:59:25,481 --> 00:59:26,573
...an educated man.

785
00:59:27,383 --> 00:59:29,317
Outside, he's nothing.

786
00:59:30,186 --> 00:59:33,678
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

787
00:59:33,890 --> 00:59:36,882
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

788
00:59:37,160 --> 00:59:38,889
You know what I'm trying to say?

789
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:42,063
I do believe
you're talking out of your ass.

790
00:59:43,332 --> 00:59:45,562
You believe whatever you want.

791
00:59:46,169 --> 00:59:48,569
But I tell you these walls are funny.

792
00:59:50,173 --> 00:59:51,834
First you hate them.

793
00:59:53,676 --> 00:59:55,576
Then you get used to them.

794
00:59:57,513 --> 00:59:59,504
Enough time passes...

795
01:00:00,183 --> 01:00:02,174
...you get so you depend on them.

796
01:00:03,186 --> 01:00:05,381
That's "institutionalized."

797
01:00:05,588 --> 01:00:06,885
Shit.

798
01:00:07,089 --> 01:00:09,853
- I could never get like that.
- Oh, yeah?

799
01:00:10,726 --> 01:00:13,217
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

800
01:00:13,462 --> 01:00:15,020
Goddamn right.

801
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,534
They send you here for life...

802
01:00:20,203 --> 01:00:22,535
...that's exactly what they take.

803
01:00:24,273 --> 01:00:26,264
Part that counts, anyway.

804
01:00:33,883 --> 01:00:36,818
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

805
01:00:37,987 --> 01:00:39,648
You go on now.

806
01:00:40,890 --> 01:00:42,380
You're free.

807
01:00:43,659 --> 01:00:45,217
You're free.

808
01:01:04,247 --> 01:01:05,908
Good luck, Brooksie.

809
01:01:43,886 --> 01:01:45,376
Dear fellas:

810
01:01:45,655 --> 01:01:49,853
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

811
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:53,822
Watch it, old-timer!
Want to get killed?

812
01:01:55,064 --> 01:01:58,556
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

813
01:01:59,201 --> 01:02:01,635
... but now they're everywhere.

814
01:02:05,308 --> 01:02:09,608
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

815
01:02:25,428 --> 01:02:29,194
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

816
01:02:29,498 --> 01:02:31,159
... called "The Brewster"...

817
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:32,527
... and a job...

818
01:02:32,735 --> 01:02:35,704
... bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

819
01:02:37,239 --> 01:02:39,673
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

820
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:42,241
... but my hands hurt most of the time.

821
01:02:42,545 --> 01:02:44,513
Make sure your man double-bags.

822
01:02:44,714 --> 01:02:46,739
Last time, the bottom near came out.

823
01:02:47,416 --> 01:02:50,351
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

824
01:02:50,553 --> 01:02:51,918
Yes, sir. Surely will.

825
01:02:52,121 --> 01:02:55,648
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

826
01:02:58,661 --> 01:03:02,961
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

827
01:03:03,399 --> 01:03:04,889
I keep thinking...

828
01:03:05,134 --> 01:03:08,467
... Jake might just show up
and say hello.

829
01:03:09,071 --> 01:03:11,062
But he never does.

830
01:03:12,274 --> 01:03:17,143
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

831
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:23,480
I have trouble sleeping at night.

832
01:03:23,786 --> 01:03:27,051
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

833
01:03:27,323 --> 01:03:29,553
I wake up scared.

834
01:03:29,759 --> 01:03:33,991
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

835
01:03:35,498 --> 01:03:40,401
Maybe I should get a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

836
01:03:40,703 --> 01:03:45,037
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

837
01:03:46,709 --> 01:03:50,702
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

838
01:03:50,946 --> 01:03:52,675
I don't like it here.

839
01:03:52,882 --> 01:03:56,875
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

840
01:03:57,720 --> 01:03:59,381
... not to stay.

841
01:04:10,299 --> 01:04:12,859
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

842
01:04:13,068 --> 01:04:16,560
... not for an old crook like me.

843
01:05:19,034 --> 01:05:23,300
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

844
01:05:24,340 --> 01:05:28,174
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

845
01:05:28,377 --> 01:05:30,709
No hard feelings. Brooks."

846
01:05:41,190 --> 01:05:43,158
He should have died in here.

847
01:05:48,697 --> 01:05:50,096
What the fuck have you done?

848
01:05:50,299 --> 01:05:52,961
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

849
01:05:58,507 --> 01:06:02,238
- What's all this?
- You tell me. They're addressed to you.

850
01:06:03,512 --> 01:06:04,843
Take it.

851
01:06:13,389 --> 01:06:14,879
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

852
01:06:16,025 --> 01:06:17,993
In response to your inquiries...

853
01:06:18,193 --> 01:06:22,459
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project."

854
01:06:23,232 --> 01:06:25,063
This is $ 200.

855
01:06:25,267 --> 01:06:29,260
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded...

856
01:06:29,471 --> 01:06:32,031
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

857
01:06:32,241 --> 01:06:36,371
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

858
01:06:36,579 --> 01:06:38,376
Please stop sending us letters."

859
01:06:38,614 --> 01:06:41,276
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

860
01:06:41,517 --> 01:06:42,677
Yes, sir.

861
01:06:46,956 --> 01:06:48,116
Good for you, Andy.

862
01:06:51,093 --> 01:06:52,219
Wow!

863
01:06:53,429 --> 01:06:55,363
It only took six years.

864
01:06:56,932 --> 01:06:59,662
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

865
01:06:59,868 --> 01:07:03,201
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

866
01:07:03,472 --> 01:07:04,302
...like he said.

867
01:07:04,506 --> 01:07:05,905
I've got to pinch a loaf.

868
01:07:06,108 --> 01:07:07,575
When I come back...

869
01:07:07,776 --> 01:07:09,539
...this is all gone, all right?

870
01:07:58,293 --> 01:07:59,692
Do you hear that?

871
01:09:08,430 --> 01:09:09,590
Dufresne!

872
01:09:12,134 --> 01:09:13,658
Andy, let me out!

873
01:09:20,542 --> 01:09:25,479
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

874
01:09:25,781 --> 01:09:28,011
Truth is, I don't want to know.

875
01:09:28,217 --> 01:09:30,708
Some things are best left unsaid.

876
01:09:34,289 --> 01:09:37,019
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

877
01:09:37,226 --> 01:09:39,353
... it can't be expressed in words...

878
01:09:39,561 --> 01:09:42,462
... and makes your heart ache
because of it.

879
01:09:44,133 --> 01:09:46,624
I tell you, those voices soared...

880
01:09:46,902 --> 01:09:51,202
... higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

881
01:09:51,406 --> 01:09:54,773
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

882
01:09:54,977 --> 01:09:57,741
... and made those walls dissolve away.

883
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:00,375
And for the briefest of moments...

884
01:10:00,582 --> 01:10:03,574
... every last man at Shawshank
felt free.

885
01:10:06,155 --> 01:10:08,817
It pissed the warden off
something awful.

886
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:11,114
Open the door.

887
01:10:14,029 --> 01:10:15,792
Open it up!

888
01:10:17,099 --> 01:10:19,829
Dufresne, open this door!

889
01:10:21,170 --> 01:10:22,364
Turn that off!

890
01:10:29,444 --> 01:10:31,878
I am warning you. Turn that off!

891
01:10:49,631 --> 01:10:51,155
You're mine now.

892
01:10:58,607 --> 01:11:01,838
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

893
01:11:02,044 --> 01:11:03,636
On your feet.

894
01:11:04,813 --> 01:11:07,213
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

895
01:11:08,984 --> 01:11:12,647
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

896
01:11:12,988 --> 01:11:15,786
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

897
01:11:15,991 --> 01:11:19,119
- Was it worth two weeks?
- Easiest time I ever did.

898
01:11:19,328 --> 01:11:23,526
- No such thing as easy time in the hole.
- A week in the hole is like a year.

899
01:11:23,732 --> 01:11:27,031
- Damn straight.
- I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

900
01:11:27,236 --> 01:11:30,205
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

901
01:11:32,641 --> 01:11:34,006
It was in here.

902
01:11:34,843 --> 01:11:36,071
In here.

903
01:11:37,212 --> 01:11:39,305
That's the beauty of music. They...

904
01:11:39,514 --> 01:11:41,846
...can't get that from you.

905
01:11:45,387 --> 01:11:47,753
Haven't you ever felt
that way about music?

906
01:11:49,558 --> 01:11:52,686
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

907
01:11:53,729 --> 01:11:55,424
Lost interest in it, though.

908
01:11:55,631 --> 01:11:57,223
Didn't make much sense in here.

909
01:11:57,566 --> 01:11:59,557
Here's where it makes the most sense.

910
01:12:00,102 --> 01:12:02,161
You need it so you don't forget.

911
01:12:02,738 --> 01:12:03,932
Forget?

912
01:12:04,306 --> 01:12:07,400
Forget that there are...

913
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:09,042
...places...

914
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:13,378
...in the world
that aren't made out of stone.

915
01:12:14,383 --> 01:12:15,873
There's something...

916
01:12:16,218 --> 01:12:17,617
...inside...

917
01:12:17,886 --> 01:12:19,854
...that they can't get to...

918
01:12:20,055 --> 01:12:21,420
...that they can't touch.

919
01:12:21,957 --> 01:12:23,390
That's yours.

920
01:12:24,927 --> 01:12:26,519
What are you talking about?

921
01:12:27,562 --> 01:12:28,790
Hope.

922
01:12:29,865 --> 01:12:31,196
Hope.

923
01:12:33,135 --> 01:12:35,126
Let me tell you something, my friend.

924
01:12:35,938 --> 01:12:38,236
Hope is a dangerous thing.

925
01:12:39,408 --> 01:12:41,740
Hope can drive a man insane.

926
01:12:42,477 --> 01:12:44,604
It's got no use on the inside.

927
01:12:44,813 --> 01:12:47,008
You'd better get used to that idea.

928
01:12:49,518 --> 01:12:51,008
Like Brooks did?

929
01:13:16,378 --> 01:13:17,367
Sit down.

930
01:13:22,718 --> 01:13:26,017
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

931
01:13:27,189 --> 01:13:29,248
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

932
01:13:29,458 --> 01:13:30,686
Oh, yes, sir.

933
01:13:31,960 --> 01:13:33,291
Without a doubt.

934
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:36,863
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

935
01:13:38,867 --> 01:13:40,801
No danger to society here.

936
01:13:41,336 --> 01:13:42,860
God's honest truth.

937
01:13:45,440 --> 01:13:47,533
Absolutely rehabilitated.

938
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:58,848
Thirty years.

939
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,720
Jesus, when you say it like that...

940
01:14:03,589 --> 01:14:05,386
You wonder where it went.

941
01:14:07,827 --> 01:14:09,988
I wonder where 10 years went.

942
01:14:14,967 --> 01:14:15,991
Here.

943
01:14:16,435 --> 01:14:19,165
A little parole rejection present.

944
01:14:20,439 --> 01:14:22,134
Go ahead and open it.

945
01:14:23,242 --> 01:14:25,267
Went through one of your competitors.

946
01:14:25,478 --> 01:14:28,606
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

947
01:14:38,658 --> 01:14:40,148
It's very pretty.

948
01:14:41,861 --> 01:14:43,055
Thank you.

949
01:14:45,631 --> 01:14:47,098
You going to play it?

950
01:14:51,671 --> 01:14:52,933
No.

951
01:14:56,542 --> 01:14:57,941
Not right now.

952
01:15:15,628 --> 01:15:16,720
Roll in!

953
01:15:52,932 --> 01:15:54,160
Lights out!

954
01:16:28,768 --> 01:16:30,895
Andy was as good as his word.

955
01:16:31,270 --> 01:16:34,034
He wrote two letters a week
instead of one.

956
01:16:36,108 --> 01:16:40,204
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

957
01:16:40,446 --> 01:16:43,574
... they couldn't buy him off
with just a $ 200 check.

958
01:16:43,783 --> 01:16:48,083
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

959
01:16:48,287 --> 01:16:50,187
... just to shut him up.

960
01:16:50,389 --> 01:16:53,381
And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

961
01:16:53,592 --> 01:16:56,527
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

962
01:16:56,729 --> 01:16:59,493
He bought remaindered books
by the pound...

963
01:16:59,999 --> 01:17:01,523
Treasure Island.

964
01:17:02,068 --> 01:17:03,399
Robert Louis...

965
01:17:03,602 --> 01:17:04,626
Stevenson.

966
01:17:04,837 --> 01:17:06,202
Fiction, adventure.

967
01:17:08,774 --> 01:17:09,798
What's next?

968
01:17:10,009 --> 01:17:13,069
I got here Auto Repair...

969
01:17:13,813 --> 01:17:14,973
...and Soap Carving.

970
01:17:15,181 --> 01:17:18,412
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

971
01:17:18,617 --> 01:17:20,482
Count of Monte Crisco.

972
01:17:20,953 --> 01:17:23,251
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

973
01:17:24,356 --> 01:17:25,345
By Alexandree...

974
01:17:25,825 --> 01:17:27,087
...Dum-ass.

975
01:17:27,426 --> 01:17:28,450
Dumb ass.

976
01:17:30,763 --> 01:17:31,821
Dumb ass?

977
01:17:34,734 --> 01:17:36,702
Dumas. IKnow what that's about?

978
01:17:38,971 --> 01:17:40,939
You'd like it.
It's about a prison break.

979
01:17:41,140 --> 01:17:45,042
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

980
01:17:45,911 --> 01:17:50,007
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

981
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,346
By the year Kennedy was shot...

982
01:17:52,585 --> 01:17:57,079
... Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

983
01:17:57,389 --> 01:18:00,483
... into the best prison library
in New England...

984
01:18:01,193 --> 01:18:04,128
... complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

985
01:18:11,504 --> 01:18:13,438
That was also when Warden Norton...

986
01:18:13,639 --> 01:18:16,574
... instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

987
01:18:17,042 --> 01:18:19,101
You may remember reading about it.

988
01:18:19,345 --> 01:18:22,439
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

989
01:18:22,648 --> 01:18:23,945
It's no free ride...

990
01:18:24,150 --> 01:18:27,381
...but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

991
01:18:27,586 --> 01:18:30,077
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

992
01:18:30,422 --> 01:18:32,947
Our inmates, properly supervised...

993
01:18:33,159 --> 01:18:35,787
...will be put to work
outside these walls...

994
01:18:35,995 --> 01:18:39,556
...performing all manner
of public service.

995
01:18:39,832 --> 01:18:42,062
These men can learn the value...

996
01:18:42,268 --> 01:18:46,068
...of an honest day's labor and
provide a service to the community...

997
01:18:46,272 --> 01:18:50,971
...at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

998
01:18:51,410 --> 01:18:53,742
Of course he didn't tell the press...

999
01:18:53,946 --> 01:18:57,404
... that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1000
01:18:57,616 --> 01:19:00,642
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1001
01:19:00,853 --> 01:19:03,344
Men, materials, you name it.

1002
01:19:03,689 --> 01:19:06,590
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1003
01:19:06,792 --> 01:19:09,317
At this rate,
you'll put me out of business.

1004
01:19:09,528 --> 01:19:13,965
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1005
01:19:14,533 --> 01:19:17,502
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1006
01:19:17,703 --> 01:19:21,366
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed.

1007
01:19:24,043 --> 01:19:25,567
We go back a long way.

1008
01:19:26,879 --> 01:19:31,816
I need this highway contract. I don't
get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1009
01:19:32,718 --> 01:19:34,515
You have some of this fine pie...

1010
01:19:34,753 --> 01:19:38,086
...my missus made for you.
You think about that.

1011
01:19:46,365 --> 01:19:49,061
I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1012
01:19:49,301 --> 01:19:52,361
I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1013
01:19:54,340 --> 01:19:57,400
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1014
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:00,671
And behind every shady deal...

1015
01:20:01,013 --> 01:20:03,641
... behind every dollar earned...

1016
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:06,976
... there was Andy, keeping the books.

1017
01:20:07,386 --> 01:20:08,648
Two deposits.

1018
01:20:08,888 --> 01:20:13,018
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1019
01:20:43,222 --> 01:20:47,556
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1020
01:20:48,027 --> 01:20:51,554
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1021
01:20:51,764 --> 01:20:53,095
How do I look?

1022
01:20:54,133 --> 01:20:56,624
- Very nice.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1023
01:20:56,835 --> 01:20:58,359
Governor will be there.

1024
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,239
You want the rest of this?

1025
01:21:02,574 --> 01:21:04,508
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1026
01:21:05,744 --> 01:21:07,075
Thank you, sir.

1027
01:21:09,915 --> 01:21:13,146
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1028
01:21:13,352 --> 01:21:18,187
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. IKickbacks on his kickbacks.

1029
01:21:18,390 --> 01:21:20,756
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1030
01:21:20,960 --> 01:21:24,794
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1031
01:21:24,997 --> 01:21:26,760
That's where I come in.

1032
01:21:27,366 --> 01:21:29,664
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1033
01:21:29,868 --> 01:21:32,701
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1034
01:21:33,038 --> 01:21:36,565
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back...

1035
01:21:36,775 --> 01:21:39,744
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
- Cleaner.

1036
01:21:40,346 --> 01:21:43,941
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1037
01:21:46,285 --> 01:21:50,619
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1038
01:21:50,889 --> 01:21:53,585
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1039
01:21:53,792 --> 01:21:56,818
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1040
01:21:57,029 --> 01:22:00,430
Now anybody gets curious,
FBI, IRS...

1041
01:22:00,632 --> 01:22:01,621
...whatever.

1042
01:22:02,067 --> 01:22:03,364
It'll lead to somebody.

1043
01:22:03,569 --> 01:22:07,437
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1044
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:12,799
All right, who?

1045
01:22:13,012 --> 01:22:14,604
Randall Stevens.

1046
01:22:15,147 --> 01:22:16,079
Who?

1047
01:22:16,281 --> 01:22:18,272
The "silent" silent partner.

1048
01:22:18,484 --> 01:22:21,544
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1049
01:22:21,754 --> 01:22:23,915
It's where the filtering
process starts.

1050
01:22:24,123 --> 01:22:26,990
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1051
01:22:27,593 --> 01:22:28,821
But who is he?

1052
01:22:29,028 --> 01:22:32,987
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1053
01:22:34,099 --> 01:22:35,259
I conjured him...

1054
01:22:35,467 --> 01:22:36,832
...out of thin air.

1055
01:22:37,636 --> 01:22:40,366
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1056
01:22:43,442 --> 01:22:45,808
You can't just make a person up.

1057
01:22:46,011 --> 01:22:49,105
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1058
01:22:49,615 --> 01:22:52,448
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1059
01:22:52,785 --> 01:22:55,413
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1060
01:22:55,621 --> 01:22:57,748
...driver's license, Social Security.

1061
01:22:58,023 --> 01:22:59,012
You're shitting me.

1062
01:22:59,224 --> 01:23:02,591
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1063
01:23:02,795 --> 01:23:04,524
...a figment of my imagination.

1064
01:23:04,730 --> 01:23:06,721
Well, I'll be damned!

1065
01:23:08,067 --> 01:23:09,796
Did I say you were good?

1066
01:23:10,169 --> 01:23:11,796
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1067
01:23:12,538 --> 01:23:14,267
The funny thing is...

1068
01:23:14,473 --> 01:23:18,569
...on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1069
01:23:18,977 --> 01:23:21,309
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1070
01:23:30,189 --> 01:23:31,486
Ever bother you?

1071
01:23:32,925 --> 01:23:35,985
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1072
01:23:36,261 --> 01:23:38,252
A fine line, maybe...

1073
01:23:38,831 --> 01:23:40,890
...but I also built that library...

1074
01:23:41,100 --> 01:23:44,126
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1075
01:23:44,336 --> 01:23:46,566
Why do you think
he lets me do all that?

1076
01:23:46,772 --> 01:23:48,967
IKeep you happy and doing the laundry.

1077
01:23:49,174 --> 01:23:50,641
Money instead of sheets.

1078
01:23:51,009 --> 01:23:53,603
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1079
01:24:10,863 --> 01:24:13,491
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

1080
01:24:13,732 --> 01:24:15,962
... on a two-year stretch for B & E.

1081
01:24:16,201 --> 01:24:18,533
That's breaking and entering to you.

1082
01:24:18,804 --> 01:24:23,036
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1083
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,772
Young punk.

1084
01:24:24,977 --> 01:24:26,604
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1085
01:24:26,812 --> 01:24:28,336
... cocky as hell.

1086
01:24:28,547 --> 01:24:30,947
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1087
01:24:31,183 --> 01:24:32,946
Making me look bad.

1088
01:24:33,152 --> 01:24:34,949
We liked him immediately.

1089
01:24:35,187 --> 01:24:38,918
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1090
01:24:39,224 --> 01:24:42,853
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1091
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:45,463
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1092
01:24:45,664 --> 01:24:50,124
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1093
01:24:50,335 --> 01:24:54,135
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, " Yes, sir. I did.

1094
01:24:54,339 --> 01:24:57,797
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too."

1095
01:25:02,281 --> 01:25:04,579
You done some stretch
in Cashman, right?

1096
01:25:05,083 --> 01:25:09,042
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1097
01:25:09,321 --> 01:25:11,255
Weekend furloughs.
Work programs.

1098
01:25:11,456 --> 01:25:12,514
Not like here.

1099
01:25:12,724 --> 01:25:15,158
Sounds like you done time all over.

1100
01:25:15,594 --> 01:25:17,994
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1101
01:25:18,197 --> 01:25:20,392
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1102
01:25:20,599 --> 01:25:23,261
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1103
01:25:24,703 --> 01:25:26,261
What I mean is...

1104
01:25:26,605 --> 01:25:30,041
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1105
01:25:30,275 --> 01:25:33,506
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1106
01:25:33,912 --> 01:25:35,504
What are you in for?

1107
01:25:35,781 --> 01:25:36,770
Me?

1108
01:25:39,218 --> 01:25:40,879
A lawyer fucked me.

1109
01:25:44,790 --> 01:25:47,759
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1110
01:25:55,667 --> 01:26:00,070
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1111
01:26:00,639 --> 01:26:02,766
Maybe he thought of them
on the streets...

1112
01:26:02,975 --> 01:26:05,466
... or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1113
01:26:05,777 --> 01:26:07,142
Whatever it was...

1114
01:26:07,479 --> 01:26:09,913
... something lit a fire
under that boy's ass.

1115
01:26:13,752 --> 01:26:16,619
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1116
01:26:16,822 --> 01:26:19,347
Hear you helped
a couple of fellas with that.

1117
01:26:20,692 --> 01:26:22,922
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1118
01:26:24,329 --> 01:26:26,820
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1119
01:26:28,567 --> 01:26:30,398
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1120
01:26:32,070 --> 01:26:33,503
You really mean that?

1121
01:26:34,539 --> 01:26:35,904
Yes, sir, I do.

1122
01:26:36,108 --> 01:26:38,076
Good. Because if we do this...

1123
01:26:38,277 --> 01:26:42,236
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1124
01:26:42,481 --> 01:26:44,278
Thing is, see...

1125
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:47,074
...I don't read so good.

1126
01:26:48,253 --> 01:26:49,345
"Well."

1127
01:26:51,356 --> 01:26:53,085
You don't read...

1128
01:26:53,325 --> 01:26:54,849
...so well.

1129
01:26:57,195 --> 01:26:58,685
We'll get to that.

1130
01:27:03,135 --> 01:27:05,262
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1131
01:27:05,470 --> 01:27:08,098
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1132
01:27:10,242 --> 01:27:12,437
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1133
01:27:12,711 --> 01:27:15,475
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1134
01:27:17,816 --> 01:27:21,252
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1135
01:27:21,453 --> 01:27:23,114
He really liked the kid.

1136
01:27:23,322 --> 01:27:26,883
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1137
01:27:27,392 --> 01:27:29,656
But that wasn't the only reason.

1138
01:27:30,362 --> 01:27:32,557
Prison time is slow time.

1139
01:27:33,031 --> 01:27:35,625
So you do what you can to keep going.

1140
01:27:35,967 --> 01:27:38,026
Some fellas collect stamps.

1141
01:27:38,437 --> 01:27:40,905
Others build matchstick houses.

1142
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:44,168
Andy built a library.

1143
01:27:44,676 --> 01:27:46,610
Now he needed a new project.

1144
01:27:47,479 --> 01:27:48,969
Tommy was it.

1145
01:27:49,614 --> 01:27:53,607
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1146
01:27:54,152 --> 01:27:57,383
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1147
01:27:58,290 --> 01:27:59,552
In prison...

1148
01:27:59,825 --> 01:28:03,556
... a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1149
01:28:04,329 --> 01:28:09,198
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1150
01:28:09,434 --> 01:28:11,629
... it was lovely Raquel.

1151
01:28:28,186 --> 01:28:29,175
Time.

1152
01:28:35,227 --> 01:28:36,216
Well?

1153
01:28:37,829 --> 01:28:39,956
Well, it's for shit.

1154
01:28:40,465 --> 01:28:43,298
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1155
01:28:43,502 --> 01:28:44,992
It's probably not that bad.

1156
01:28:45,203 --> 01:28:49,435
I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1157
01:28:49,641 --> 01:28:51,370
Let's see how the score comes out.

1158
01:28:51,576 --> 01:28:54,545
I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1159
01:28:56,481 --> 01:28:57,846
Two points, right there!

1160
01:28:58,049 --> 01:28:59,607
There's your goddamn score!

1161
01:28:59,851 --> 01:29:03,548
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1162
01:29:04,489 --> 01:29:06,116
Fuck this place!

1163
01:29:06,358 --> 01:29:07,484
Fuck it!

1164
01:29:26,645 --> 01:29:27,907
I feel bad.

1165
01:29:28,113 --> 01:29:29,307
I let him down.

1166
01:29:29,514 --> 01:29:31,243
That's crap, kid.

1167
01:29:31,450 --> 01:29:32,781
He's proud of you.

1168
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:35,985
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1169
01:29:36,188 --> 01:29:37,746
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1170
01:29:37,956 --> 01:29:41,084
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1171
01:29:41,293 --> 01:29:43,523
What's he in here for anyway?

1172
01:29:43,862 --> 01:29:44,829
Murder.

1173
01:29:46,298 --> 01:29:47,663
The hell, you say.

1174
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:52,133
You wouldn't think it
to look at the guy.

1175
01:29:53,371 --> 01:29:57,467
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1176
01:30:05,484 --> 01:30:06,473
What?

1177
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:10,379
About four years ago...

1178
01:30:10,655 --> 01:30:13,886
...I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1179
01:30:14,392 --> 01:30:15,689
I stole a car.

1180
01:30:16,061 --> 01:30:18,052
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1181
01:30:18,730 --> 01:30:20,960
About six months left to go...

1182
01:30:21,266 --> 01:30:23,166
...I get a new cellmate in.

1183
01:30:23,869 --> 01:30:25,496
Elmo Blatch.

1184
01:30:26,204 --> 01:30:27,535
Big, twitchy fucker.

1185
01:30:28,406 --> 01:30:31,898
IKind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1186
01:30:32,110 --> 01:30:34,840
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1187
01:30:35,113 --> 01:30:37,377
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1188
01:30:37,582 --> 01:30:42,519
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1189
01:30:43,588 --> 01:30:48,218
Talked all the time too. That's
the other thing. He never shut up.

1190
01:30:48,426 --> 01:30:50,053
Places he'd been in...

1191
01:30:50,362 --> 01:30:53,422
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1192
01:30:53,665 --> 01:30:55,860
Even people he killed.

1193
01:30:57,102 --> 01:30:59,900
People who "gave him shit."

1194
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:02,097
That's how he put it.

1195
01:31:04,709 --> 01:31:06,768
So one night, like a joke...

1196
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:11,371
...I say to him,
"Elmo, who did you kill?"

1197
01:31:11,616 --> 01:31:12,708
So he says:

1198
01:31:12,918 --> 01:31:16,877
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1199
01:31:17,556 --> 01:31:21,458
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1200
01:31:23,562 --> 01:31:25,553
So I pick out this guy...

1201
01:31:26,464 --> 01:31:28,022
...go in one night...

1202
01:31:28,233 --> 01:31:29,962
...and do his place.

1203
01:31:31,403 --> 01:31:32,734
He wakes up...

1204
01:31:33,471 --> 01:31:35,234
...and gives me shit.

1205
01:31:36,308 --> 01:31:37,969
So I killed him.

1206
01:31:39,744 --> 01:31:42,577
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1207
01:31:43,982 --> 01:31:46,246
And that's the best part.

1208
01:31:46,918 --> 01:31:49,386
She's fucking this prick, see...

1209
01:31:49,588 --> 01:31:52,648
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1210
01:31:53,258 --> 01:31:55,818
Some hotshot banker.

1211
01:31:57,262 --> 01:31:59,753
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1212
01:32:11,242 --> 01:32:15,110
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1213
01:32:16,381 --> 01:32:18,872
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1214
01:32:19,618 --> 01:32:20,585
Sir?

1215
01:32:22,821 --> 01:32:26,416
It's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1216
01:32:27,025 --> 01:32:30,961
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1217
01:32:31,162 --> 01:32:33,323
He's young, not terribly bright.

1218
01:32:33,865 --> 01:32:37,301
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1219
01:32:37,702 --> 01:32:39,260
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1220
01:32:40,038 --> 01:32:44,202
Let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1221
01:32:44,476 --> 01:32:49,106
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.

1222
01:32:49,314 --> 01:32:52,010
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence."

1223
01:32:52,217 --> 01:32:55,015
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1224
01:32:55,220 --> 01:32:57,688
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1225
01:32:57,922 --> 01:32:59,856
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1226
01:33:00,058 --> 01:33:02,526
They'd have his last known address.

1227
01:33:02,727 --> 01:33:04,661
It's a chance, isn't it?

1228
01:33:06,998 --> 01:33:08,727
How can you be so obtuse?

1229
01:33:09,668 --> 01:33:10,657
What?

1230
01:33:12,170 --> 01:33:13,637
What did you call me?

1231
01:33:13,838 --> 01:33:15,567
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1232
01:33:15,940 --> 01:33:17,430
You're forgetting yourself.

1233
01:33:17,776 --> 01:33:20,711
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1234
01:33:20,912 --> 01:33:23,676
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1235
01:33:23,882 --> 01:33:26,578
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1236
01:33:26,785 --> 01:33:29,379
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1237
01:33:29,587 --> 01:33:32,181
If I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1238
01:33:32,824 --> 01:33:35,793
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1239
01:33:37,662 --> 01:33:40,597
Don't ever mention money to me,
you son of a bitch!

1240
01:33:40,799 --> 01:33:42,460
Not in this office...

1241
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:44,601
...not anywhere.
Get in here, now!

1242
01:33:44,836 --> 01:33:47,532
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1243
01:33:48,173 --> 01:33:49,435
Solitary. A month.

1244
01:33:50,442 --> 01:33:51,739
What's wrong with you?

1245
01:33:51,943 --> 01:33:53,240
Get him out of here.

1246
01:33:53,445 --> 01:33:55,003
This is my chance to get out!

1247
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:57,010
It's my life! Understand?!

1248
01:33:57,215 --> 01:33:59,274
Get him out!

1249
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:03,020
A month in the hole.

1250
01:34:03,221 --> 01:34:05,917
That's the longest stretch
I ever heard of.

1251
01:34:06,124 --> 01:34:07,421
It's all my fault.

1252
01:34:07,625 --> 01:34:09,217
Bullshit.

1253
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:12,590
You didn't pull the trigger
or convict him.

1254
01:34:12,797 --> 01:34:15,197
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1255
01:34:15,400 --> 01:34:17,425
I mean, for real innocent?

1256
01:34:17,635 --> 01:34:18,966
It looks that way.

1257
01:34:19,404 --> 01:34:21,304
Sweet Jesus.

1258
01:34:21,573 --> 01:34:23,404
How long has he been here now?

1259
01:34:23,808 --> 01:34:27,073
1947. What is that?
Nineteen years.

1260
01:34:27,312 --> 01:34:29,906
- Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1261
01:34:35,754 --> 01:34:36,914
What you got?

1262
01:34:37,555 --> 01:34:38,886
Board of Education.

1263
01:34:39,090 --> 01:34:40,614
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1264
01:34:40,825 --> 01:34:44,784
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1265
01:34:44,996 --> 01:34:47,157
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1266
01:34:47,665 --> 01:34:50,498
Skeets, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1267
01:34:51,336 --> 01:34:52,667
Floyd, come on.

1268
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:00,509
Will you throw that away, please?

1269
01:35:06,117 --> 01:35:07,846
Well, shit.

1270
01:35:20,532 --> 01:35:23,330
The kid passed. C + average.

1271
01:35:23,535 --> 01:35:25,628
Thought you'd like to know.

1272
01:35:41,853 --> 01:35:43,320
Warden wants to talk.

1273
01:35:57,068 --> 01:35:58,126
Out here?

1274
01:35:58,336 --> 01:36:00,566
That's what the man said.

1275
01:36:16,688 --> 01:36:17,677
Warden?

1276
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:31,760
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1277
01:36:33,271 --> 01:36:35,535
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1278
01:36:53,992 --> 01:36:56,051
We got a situation here.

1279
01:36:56,928 --> 01:36:59,021
I think you can appreciate that.

1280
01:36:59,230 --> 01:37:00,458
Yes, sir.

1281
01:37:00,732 --> 01:37:02,131
I sure can.

1282
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:06,427
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1283
01:37:07,906 --> 01:37:10,466
It's got me up nights.
That's the truth.

1284
01:37:12,744 --> 01:37:14,575
The right thing to do...

1285
01:37:16,247 --> 01:37:19,978
...sometimes it's hard to know
what that is.

1286
01:37:20,985 --> 01:37:22,418
Do you understand?

1287
01:37:24,722 --> 01:37:26,314
I need your help, son.

1288
01:37:27,759 --> 01:37:29,920
If I'm going to move on this...

1289
01:37:30,261 --> 01:37:33,424
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1290
01:37:34,165 --> 01:37:35,223
I have to know...

1291
01:37:35,433 --> 01:37:38,061
...if what you told Dufresne
was the truth.

1292
01:37:38,269 --> 01:37:39,395
Yes, sir.

1293
01:37:39,604 --> 01:37:40,832
Absolutely.

1294
01:37:41,339 --> 01:37:44,331
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1295
01:37:44,542 --> 01:37:46,533
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1296
01:37:46,744 --> 01:37:49,406
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1297
01:37:49,614 --> 01:37:51,411
Just give me that chance.

1298
01:37:55,687 --> 01:37:57,018
That's what I thought.

1299
01:38:44,102 --> 01:38:46,002
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1300
01:38:47,772 --> 01:38:48,796
Terrible thing.

1301
01:38:50,408 --> 01:38:51,875
A man that young...

1302
01:38:52,210 --> 01:38:54,804
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1303
01:38:55,346 --> 01:38:57,837
Broke Captain Hadley's heart
to shoot him.

1304
01:38:58,583 --> 01:39:00,073
Truly, it did.

1305
01:39:03,087 --> 01:39:05,521
We just have to put it behind us.

1306
01:39:07,191 --> 01:39:08,419
Move on.

1307
01:39:10,028 --> 01:39:11,518
I'm done.

1308
01:39:12,830 --> 01:39:14,457
Everything stops.

1309
01:39:16,434 --> 01:39:18,766
Get someone else to run your scams.

1310
01:39:20,038 --> 01:39:21,869
Nothing stops.

1311
01:39:23,207 --> 01:39:24,367
Nothing.

1312
01:39:27,779 --> 01:39:30,873
Or you will do
the hardest time there is.

1313
01:39:31,282 --> 01:39:33,580
No more protection from the guards.

1314
01:39:33,818 --> 01:39:38,721
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1315
01:39:40,124 --> 01:39:42,558
You'll think you've been
fucked by a train.

1316
01:39:43,961 --> 01:39:45,451
And the library?

1317
01:39:46,130 --> 01:39:47,119
Gone.

1318
01:39:47,732 --> 01:39:50,292
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1319
01:39:50,768 --> 01:39:53,430
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1320
01:39:53,638 --> 01:39:55,765
They'll see the flames for miles.

1321
01:39:55,973 --> 01:39:58,806
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1322
01:40:00,078 --> 01:40:03,070
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1323
01:40:06,818 --> 01:40:08,683
Or am I being obtuse?

1324
01:40:20,465 --> 01:40:23,093
Give him another month
to think about it.

1325
01:41:09,847 --> 01:41:12,907
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1326
01:41:13,718 --> 01:41:15,549
Like a closed book.

1327
01:41:16,354 --> 01:41:18,379
Complained about it all the time.

1328
01:41:19,323 --> 01:41:20,881
She was beautiful.

1329
01:41:23,294 --> 01:41:24,818
God, I loved her.

1330
01:41:28,533 --> 01:41:30,763
I didn't know how
to show it, that's all.

1331
01:41:33,504 --> 01:41:35,165
I killed her, Red.

1332
01:41:37,041 --> 01:41:38,838
I didn't pull the trigger...

1333
01:41:40,278 --> 01:41:42,007
...but I drove her away.

1334
01:41:43,514 --> 01:41:46,210
That's why she died, because of me...

1335
01:41:46,417 --> 01:41:47,782
...the way I am.

1336
01:41:56,794 --> 01:41:58,625
That don't make you a murderer.

1337
01:42:01,999 --> 01:42:03,762
Bad husband, maybe.

1338
01:42:07,405 --> 01:42:10,670
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1339
01:42:10,875 --> 01:42:12,206
No, I didn't.

1340
01:42:12,610 --> 01:42:14,544
Somebody else did.

1341
01:42:15,780 --> 01:42:17,873
And I wound up in here.

1342
01:42:20,351 --> 01:42:21,943
Bad luck, I guess.

1343
01:42:27,158 --> 01:42:28,591
It floats around.

1344
01:42:29,627 --> 01:42:31,857
It's got to land on somebody.

1345
01:42:32,763 --> 01:42:34,663
It was my turn, that's all.

1346
01:42:35,366 --> 01:42:38,130
I was in the path of the tornado.

1347
01:42:44,075 --> 01:42:48,034
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1348
01:42:52,383 --> 01:42:54,078
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1349
01:42:55,319 --> 01:42:56,343
Me?

1350
01:42:59,323 --> 01:43:00,312
Yeah.

1351
01:43:01,659 --> 01:43:03,957
One day, when I got
a long, white beard...

1352
01:43:04,161 --> 01:43:07,324
...and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs.

1353
01:43:09,367 --> 01:43:10,994
I tell you where I'd go.

1354
01:43:12,470 --> 01:43:14,131
Zihuatanejo.

1355
01:43:15,006 --> 01:43:16,200
Say what?

1356
01:43:16,507 --> 01:43:18,338
Zihuatanejo.

1357
01:43:19,277 --> 01:43:20,938
It's in Mexico.

1358
01:43:22,313 --> 01:43:24,440
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1359
01:43:25,583 --> 01:43:28,381
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1360
01:43:30,187 --> 01:43:32,178
They say it has no memory.

1361
01:43:34,158 --> 01:43:36,820
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1362
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,953
A warm place with no memory.

1363
01:43:44,201 --> 01:43:46,135
Open up a little hotel...

1364
01:43:47,838 --> 01:43:49,328
...right on the beach.

1365
01:43:49,940 --> 01:43:52,135
Buy some worthless old boat...

1366
01:43:52,677 --> 01:43:54,304
...and fix it up new.

1367
01:43:57,048 --> 01:43:58,276
Take my guests out...

1368
01:43:59,116 --> 01:44:00,481
...charter fishing.

1369
01:44:04,322 --> 01:44:06,051
Zihuatanejo.

1370
01:44:09,593 --> 01:44:13,461
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1371
01:44:20,004 --> 01:44:22,837
I don't think I could make it
on the outside.

1372
01:44:29,513 --> 01:44:31,572
I been in here most of my life.

1373
01:44:33,017 --> 01:44:34,780
I'm an institutional man now.

1374
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:37,415
Just like Brooks was.

1375
01:44:38,889 --> 01:44:40,584
You underestimate yourself.

1376
01:44:41,158 --> 01:44:42,750
I don't think so.

1377
01:44:46,597 --> 01:44:50,533
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1378
01:44:51,302 --> 01:44:53,827
...outside all you need
is the Yellow Pages.

1379
01:44:54,038 --> 01:44:56,268
Hell, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

1380
01:44:58,409 --> 01:45:00,036
Pacific Ocean?

1381
01:45:00,444 --> 01:45:01,672
Shit.

1382
01:45:02,046 --> 01:45:04,241
Scare me to death,
something that big.

1383
01:45:04,448 --> 01:45:05,745
Not me.

1384
01:45:06,951 --> 01:45:09,715
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1385
01:45:11,455 --> 01:45:14,686
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1386
01:45:15,726 --> 01:45:17,216
That hotel, that boat...

1387
01:45:18,996 --> 01:45:21,226
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1388
01:45:26,137 --> 01:45:28,571
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1389
01:45:28,773 --> 01:45:30,798
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1390
01:45:31,242 --> 01:45:33,710
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1391
01:45:33,911 --> 01:45:35,469
...and that's the way it is.

1392
01:45:35,813 --> 01:45:38,646
Yeah, right.
That's the way it is.

1393
01:45:40,151 --> 01:45:42,551
It's down there and I'm in here.

1394
01:45:45,122 --> 01:45:47,852
I guess it comes down
to a simple choice.

1395
01:45:50,761 --> 01:45:52,251
Get busy living...

1396
01:45:53,631 --> 01:45:55,656
...or get busy dying.

1397
01:46:07,778 --> 01:46:10,508
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1398
01:46:10,714 --> 01:46:12,978
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1399
01:46:14,852 --> 01:46:18,720
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1400
01:46:20,191 --> 01:46:23,319
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1401
01:46:23,527 --> 01:46:27,463
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1402
01:46:27,665 --> 01:46:30,532
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1403
01:46:31,469 --> 01:46:33,960
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1404
01:46:35,372 --> 01:46:37,465
We went there for a picnic...

1405
01:46:37,875 --> 01:46:39,968
...and made love under that oak...

1406
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,874
...and I asked and she said yes.

1407
01:46:46,884 --> 01:46:48,715
Promise me, Red.

1408
01:46:49,553 --> 01:46:51,180
If you ever get out...

1409
01:46:51,388 --> 01:46:52,878
...find that spot.

1410
01:46:54,058 --> 01:46:58,893
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1411
01:47:00,030 --> 01:47:03,056
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1412
01:47:05,736 --> 01:47:08,398
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1413
01:47:09,173 --> 01:47:10,401
What, Andy?

1414
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:12,570
What's buried under there?

1415
01:47:14,178 --> 01:47:16,043
You'll have to pry it up...

1416
01:47:16,247 --> 01:47:17,509
...to see.

1417
01:47:23,387 --> 01:47:25,355
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1418
01:47:26,023 --> 01:47:27,752
He's talking funny.

1419
01:47:28,859 --> 01:47:30,554
I'm really worried about him.

1420
01:47:30,961 --> 01:47:32,394
Let's keep an eye on him.

1421
01:47:32,596 --> 01:47:35,861
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1422
01:47:37,301 --> 01:47:38,427
Oh, Lord.

1423
01:47:39,770 --> 01:47:40,600
What?

1424
01:47:42,106 --> 01:47:44,870
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1425
01:47:45,075 --> 01:47:47,168
He asked me for a length of rope.

1426
01:47:47,378 --> 01:47:48,208
Rope?

1427
01:47:48,412 --> 01:47:50,073
Six feet long.

1428
01:47:50,314 --> 01:47:51,679
And you gave it to him.

1429
01:47:52,550 --> 01:47:54,347
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

1430
01:47:54,552 --> 01:47:56,110
Jesus! Heywood.

1431
01:47:56,720 --> 01:47:58,688
How was I supposed to know?

1432
01:47:58,889 --> 01:48:00,447
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1433
01:48:02,459 --> 01:48:04,393
Andy would never do that.

1434
01:48:04,995 --> 01:48:06,053
Never.

1435
01:48:08,132 --> 01:48:09,463
I don't know.

1436
01:48:12,303 --> 01:48:14,328
Every man has his breaking point.

1437
01:48:16,674 --> 01:48:18,938
Lickety-split.
Want to get home.

1438
01:48:19,243 --> 01:48:21,006
Just about finished, sir.

1439
01:48:38,128 --> 01:48:39,755
Three deposits tonight.

1440
01:48:47,738 --> 01:48:49,638
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1441
01:48:49,840 --> 01:48:51,467
And shine my shoes.

1442
01:48:51,675 --> 01:48:54,610
- I want them looking like mirrors.
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:49:00,117 --> 01:49:01,584
It's good having you back.

1444
01:49:02,519 --> 01:49:04,384
Place wasn't the same without you.

1445
01:49:51,268 --> 01:49:52,326
Lights out!

1446
01:50:25,169 --> 01:50:27,694
I've had some long nights in stir.

1447
01:50:28,238 --> 01:50:30,900
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1448
01:50:31,108 --> 01:50:33,770
... time can draw out like a blade.

1449
01:50:39,116 --> 01:50:42,108
That was the longest night of my life.

1450
01:50:57,968 --> 01:50:59,128
Give me a count!

1451
01:51:03,640 --> 01:51:06,473
Tier 3 south, clear!

1452
01:51:09,613 --> 01:51:12,776
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1453
01:51:12,983 --> 01:51:14,041
Dufresne!

1454
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:17,019
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1455
01:51:20,157 --> 01:51:23,558
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1456
01:51:31,135 --> 01:51:34,969
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1457
01:51:35,172 --> 01:51:38,471
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1458
01:51:38,675 --> 01:51:40,006
You hear me?

1459
01:51:46,116 --> 01:51:48,209
Oh, my Holy God.

1460
01:52:05,202 --> 01:52:07,762
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1461
01:52:08,205 --> 01:52:10,765
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1462
01:52:13,343 --> 01:52:14,901
Open 237.

1463
01:52:18,415 --> 01:52:22,078
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1464
01:52:22,953 --> 01:52:24,284
Don't tell me that again.

1465
01:52:24,488 --> 01:52:25,512
But sir, he wasn't.

1466
01:52:25,756 --> 01:52:29,214
I can see that, Haig!
Think I'm blind?

1467
01:52:29,893 --> 01:52:31,292
Is that what you're saying?

1468
01:52:31,495 --> 01:52:34,157
- Am I blind, Haig?
- No, sir!

1469
01:52:35,065 --> 01:52:37,556
What about you. You blind?

1470
01:52:38,068 --> 01:52:40,628
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1471
01:52:40,838 --> 01:52:44,137
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1472
01:52:44,341 --> 01:52:45,672
"Dufresne."

1473
01:52:47,344 --> 01:52:48,811
He was in his cell...

1474
01:52:49,046 --> 01:52:50,013
...at lights out.

1475
01:52:50,214 --> 01:52:52,478
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

1476
01:52:53,517 --> 01:52:55,144
I want him found.

1477
01:52:55,352 --> 01:52:58,810
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1478
01:52:59,056 --> 01:53:00,250
Yes, sir.

1479
01:53:01,258 --> 01:53:03,522
Let's go. Move your butts.

1480
01:53:06,930 --> 01:53:07,919
Stand.

1481
01:53:09,366 --> 01:53:10,424
Well?

1482
01:53:13,871 --> 01:53:14,860
Well, what?

1483
01:53:15,072 --> 01:53:18,530
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1484
01:53:19,610 --> 01:53:21,100
He must have said something.

1485
01:53:21,845 --> 01:53:23,369
No, sir, Warden.

1486
01:53:23,747 --> 01:53:24,714
Not a word.

1487
01:53:26,550 --> 01:53:29,110
Lord, it's a miracle!

1488
01:53:29,720 --> 01:53:32,280
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1489
01:53:32,956 --> 01:53:34,116
Nothing left...

1490
01:53:34,958 --> 01:53:37,688
...but some damn rocks
on a windowsill.

1491
01:53:37,895 --> 01:53:40,625
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1492
01:53:40,831 --> 01:53:42,594
Maybe she knows.

1493
01:53:42,833 --> 01:53:45,563
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1494
01:53:47,004 --> 01:53:48,301
Guess not.

1495
01:53:48,872 --> 01:53:51,067
Why should she be any different?

1496
01:53:52,142 --> 01:53:53,803
This is a conspiracy.

1497
01:53:54,444 --> 01:53:56,275
That's what this is.

1498
01:53:56,880 --> 01:54:00,611
One big, damn conspiracy!

1499
01:54:00,884 --> 01:54:02,875
And everyone's in on it!

1500
01:54:03,520 --> 01:54:04,680
Including her!

1501
01:54:39,723 --> 01:54:41,418
In 1966...

1502
01:54:41,625 --> 01:54:44,025
... Andy Dufresne escaped...

1503
01:54:44,227 --> 01:54:45,785
... from Shawshank Prison.

1504
01:54:48,031 --> 01:54:50,591
All they found
was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1505
01:54:51,234 --> 01:54:52,758
... a bar of soap...

1506
01:54:52,970 --> 01:54:54,528
... and an old rock hammer...

1507
01:54:54,738 --> 01:54:57,206
... damn near worn down to the nub.

1508
01:55:01,712 --> 01:55:06,479
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it.

1509
01:55:07,117 --> 01:55:09,745
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1510
01:55:28,038 --> 01:55:30,336
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1511
01:55:31,108 --> 01:55:34,271
I imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature.

1512
01:55:34,678 --> 01:55:36,509
An ice age here...

1513
01:55:36,947 --> 01:55:39,438
... million years
of mountain building there.

1514
01:55:40,450 --> 01:55:43,283
Geology is the study
of pressure and time.

1515
01:55:44,121 --> 01:55:46,112
That's all it takes, really.

1516
01:55:46,857 --> 01:55:47,949
Pressure...

1517
01:55:48,592 --> 01:55:49,854
... and time.

1518
01:55:51,194 --> 01:55:53,253
That and a big goddamn poster.

1519
01:55:57,300 --> 01:55:58,232
Like I said...

1520
01:55:58,735 --> 01:56:02,728
... in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1521
01:56:05,542 --> 01:56:10,343
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1522
01:56:10,881 --> 01:56:12,815
... a handful at a time.

1523
01:56:14,117 --> 01:56:16,176
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1524
01:56:16,386 --> 01:56:19,355
... Andy decided
he'd been here long enough.

1525
01:56:19,556 --> 01:56:22,116
Lickety-split.
I want to get home.

1526
01:56:22,859 --> 01:56:24,884
I'm just about finished, sir.

1527
01:56:46,349 --> 01:56:48,283
Three deposits tonight.

1528
01:56:55,592 --> 01:56:57,890
Andy did like he was told.

1529
01:56:58,095 --> 01:57:01,587
Buffed those shoes
to a high mirror-shine.

1530
01:57:05,268 --> 01:57:07,566
The guards simply didn't notice.

1531
01:57:07,871 --> 01:57:09,338
Neither did I.

1532
01:57:09,539 --> 01:57:11,063
I mean, seriously...

1533
01:57:11,274 --> 01:57:14,266
... how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

1534
01:59:17,834 --> 01:59:20,997
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1535
01:59:21,238 --> 01:59:24,571
... of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.

1536
01:59:25,575 --> 01:59:27,907
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1537
01:59:32,315 --> 01:59:34,681
Five hundred yards.

1538
01:59:35,185 --> 01:59:38,245
That's the length
of five football fields.

1539
01:59:38,888 --> 01:59:41,448
Just shy of half a mile.

1540
02:00:36,680 --> 02:00:41,276
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

1541
02:00:41,584 --> 02:00:44,417
... a man nobody ever
laid eyes on before...

1542
02:00:44,654 --> 02:00:47,248
... strolled into
the Maine National Bank.

1543
02:00:47,824 --> 02:00:50,987
Until that moment,
he didn't exist.

1544
02:00:51,561 --> 02:00:53,927
- Except on paper.
- May I help you?

1545
02:00:54,331 --> 02:00:56,265
He had all the proper ID...

1546
02:00:56,466 --> 02:01:00,163
... driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card...

1547
02:01:00,603 --> 02:01:03,128
And the signature
was a spot-on match.

1548
02:01:03,340 --> 02:01:06,434
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1549
02:01:06,643 --> 02:01:08,372
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1550
02:01:09,179 --> 02:01:10,271
Thank you.

1551
02:01:10,947 --> 02:01:12,107
I'm sure I will.

1552
02:01:13,016 --> 02:01:16,349
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1553
02:01:16,553 --> 02:01:17,542
Please.

1554
02:01:18,121 --> 02:01:20,612
Would you add this
to your outgoing mail?

1555
02:01:21,124 --> 02:01:22,318
I'd be happy to.

1556
02:01:24,127 --> 02:01:25,458
Good day, sir.

1557
02:01:26,396 --> 02:01:30,833
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1558
02:01:31,301 --> 02:01:32,893
All told, he blew town...

1559
02:01:33,103 --> 02:01:37,938
... with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1560
02:01:38,641 --> 02:01:41,405
Severance pay for 19 years.

1561
02:01:48,651 --> 02:01:50,846
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1562
02:02:43,706 --> 02:02:46,641
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1563
02:02:46,910 --> 02:02:51,347
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1564
02:02:51,781 --> 02:02:56,241
I wasn't there to see, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1565
02:02:56,453 --> 02:02:57,943
... when they took him away.

1566
02:03:03,827 --> 02:03:07,228
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1567
02:03:23,079 --> 02:03:23,909
Samuel Norton.

1568
02:03:24,714 --> 02:03:27,148
We have a warrant
for your arrest. Open up.

1569
02:03:31,888 --> 02:03:32,980
Open the door.

1570
02:03:33,523 --> 02:03:34,785
I'm not sure which key.

1571
02:03:44,934 --> 02:03:46,868
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1572
02:03:58,381 --> 02:04:01,839
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1573
02:04:02,051 --> 02:04:03,643
... other than that bullet...

1574
02:04:03,853 --> 02:04:08,290
... was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1575
02:04:10,793 --> 02:04:14,251
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1576
02:04:14,531 --> 02:04:16,590
... I got a postcard in the mail.

1577
02:04:18,067 --> 02:04:20,900
It was blank,
but the postmark said...

1578
02:04:21,104 --> 02:04:23,231
... Fort Hancock, Texas.

1579
02:04:23,773 --> 02:04:25,138
Fort Hancock...

1580
02:04:25,408 --> 02:04:27,137
... right on the border.

1581
02:04:27,544 --> 02:04:29,535
That's where Andy crossed.

1582
02:04:30,113 --> 02:04:34,243
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1583
02:04:34,584 --> 02:04:36,814
... it always makes me laugh.

1584
02:04:38,655 --> 02:04:40,213
Andy Dufresne...

1585
02:04:40,590 --> 02:04:42,615
... who crawled through
a river of shit...

1586
02:04:42,825 --> 02:04:45,225
... and came out clean
on the other side.

1587
02:04:46,062 --> 02:04:47,427
Andy Dufresne...

1588
02:04:48,231 --> 02:04:49,823
... headed for the Pacific.

1589
02:04:52,802 --> 02:04:54,963
Hadley's got him
by the throat, right?

1590
02:04:55,171 --> 02:04:58,971
He says, " I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1591
02:04:59,175 --> 02:05:02,042
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1592
02:05:02,712 --> 02:05:04,407
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1593
02:05:04,614 --> 02:05:07,583
"My friends could use
a couple of beers."

1594
02:05:07,917 --> 02:05:09,578
And he got it!

1595
02:05:10,820 --> 02:05:13,220
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1596
02:05:13,489 --> 02:05:14,922
... Andy being gone.

1597
02:05:15,625 --> 02:05:19,755
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1598
02:05:20,229 --> 02:05:22,288
Their feathers are just too bright.

1599
02:05:24,000 --> 02:05:25,729
And when they fly away...

1600
02:05:26,169 --> 02:05:30,572
... the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1601
02:05:31,641 --> 02:05:32,903
But still...

1602
02:05:33,376 --> 02:05:37,710
... the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1603
02:05:41,918 --> 02:05:44,284
I guess I just miss my friend.

1604
02:06:08,978 --> 02:06:09,910
Please sit down.

1605
02:06:15,752 --> 02:06:17,310
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1606
02:06:17,854 --> 02:06:21,119
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1607
02:06:21,924 --> 02:06:24,051
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1608
02:06:25,928 --> 02:06:27,486
Rehabilitated?

1609
02:06:29,532 --> 02:06:31,432
Well, now, let me see.

1610
02:06:32,435 --> 02:06:34,767
I don't have any idea
what that means.

1611
02:06:36,873 --> 02:06:39,137
It means you're ready
to rejoin society...

1612
02:06:39,709 --> 02:06:42,041
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1613
02:06:44,213 --> 02:06:46,204
To me it's just a made-up word.

1614
02:06:47,550 --> 02:06:49,882
A politician's word so that...

1615
02:06:50,319 --> 02:06:53,846
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1616
02:06:54,323 --> 02:06:55,915
...and have a job.

1617
02:06:57,894 --> 02:06:59,987
What do you really want to know?

1618
02:07:00,763 --> 02:07:02,731
Am I sorry for what I did?

1619
02:07:03,166 --> 02:07:04,326
Well, are you?

1620
02:07:06,235 --> 02:07:09,068
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1621
02:07:10,440 --> 02:07:13,898
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1622
02:07:17,380 --> 02:07:19,940
I look back on the way I was then...

1623
02:07:22,085 --> 02:07:23,245
...a young...

1624
02:07:24,353 --> 02:07:27,845
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1625
02:07:30,860 --> 02:07:32,555
I want to talk to him.

1626
02:07:34,497 --> 02:07:36,965
I want to try
and talk some sense to him.

1627
02:07:37,700 --> 02:07:39,634
Tell him the way things are.

1628
02:07:41,738 --> 02:07:43,171
But I can't.

1629
02:07:45,374 --> 02:07:47,365
That kid's long gone...

1630
02:07:48,578 --> 02:07:51,342
...and this old man is all that's left.

1631
02:07:52,749 --> 02:07:54,216
I got to live with that.

1632
02:07:55,585 --> 02:07:57,280
Rehabilitated?

1633
02:07:57,653 --> 02:07:59,484
It's just a bullshit word.

1634
02:08:00,423 --> 02:08:05,190
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1635
02:08:06,429 --> 02:08:08,693
Because to tell you the truth...

1636
02:08:09,031 --> 02:08:11,022
...I don't give a shit.

1637
02:09:37,553 --> 02:09:38,952
Here you go, miss.

1638
02:09:41,891 --> 02:09:42,915
Restroom break?

1639
02:09:48,731 --> 02:09:53,259
You don't need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1640
02:10:06,315 --> 02:10:09,375
Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.

1641
02:10:10,219 --> 02:10:13,211
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1642
02:10:16,726 --> 02:10:18,887
There's a harsh truth to face.

1643
02:10:20,563 --> 02:10:23,464
No way I'm going to make it
on the outside.

1644
02:10:31,340 --> 02:10:35,037
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1645
02:10:35,845 --> 02:10:38,313
... so maybe they'd send me back.

1646
02:10:43,519 --> 02:10:45,953
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1647
02:10:46,856 --> 02:10:48,517
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1648
02:10:48,724 --> 02:10:50,658
Knew it all too well.

1649
02:10:52,261 --> 02:10:55,662
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1650
02:10:56,098 --> 02:10:58,828
Where I won't have to be afraid
all the time.

1651
02:11:00,836 --> 02:11:03,202
Only one thing stops me.

1652
02:11:04,640 --> 02:11:07,040
A promise I made to Andy.

1653
02:11:27,563 --> 02:11:28,689
There it is.

1654
02:11:39,308 --> 02:11:40,969
Much obliged, sir.

1655
02:15:20,296 --> 02:15:21,558
Dear Red:

1656
02:15:21,797 --> 02:15:24,265
If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...

1657
02:15:24,466 --> 02:15:28,527
... and if you've come this far,
maybe you'd come a bit further.

1658
02:15:28,804 --> 02:15:31,272
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1659
02:15:33,576 --> 02:15:35,066
Zihuatanejo.

1660
02:15:36,712 --> 02:15:40,307
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1661
02:15:40,816 --> 02:15:44,343
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1662
02:15:45,154 --> 02:15:46,553
Remember, Red...

1663
02:15:46,889 --> 02:15:48,982
... hope is a good thing...

1664
02:15:49,191 --> 02:15:51,182
... maybe the best of things.

1665
02:15:51,393 --> 02:15:53,554
And no good thing ever dies.

1666
02:15:54,096 --> 02:15:56,963
I will be hoping
that this letter finds you...

1667
02:15:57,166 --> 02:15:58,895
... and finds you well.

1668
02:15:59,401 --> 02:16:00,629
Your friend...

1669
02:16:00,836 --> 02:16:01,996
... Andy.

1670
02:16:35,838 --> 02:16:37,567
"Get busy living...

1671
02:16:37,773 --> 02:16:39,673
... or get busy dying. "

1672
02:16:42,378 --> 02:16:44,539
That's goddamn right.

1673
02:16:49,785 --> 02:16:51,912
For the second time in my life...

1674
02:16:52,154 --> 02:16:54,714
... I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1675
02:16:55,791 --> 02:16:57,725
Parole violation.

1676
02:16:58,394 --> 02:17:02,057
Of course I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1677
02:17:02,731 --> 02:17:04,756
Not for an old crook like me.

1678
02:17:04,967 --> 02:17:06,992
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1679
02:17:10,673 --> 02:17:15,406
I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1680
02:17:15,844 --> 02:17:19,177
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1681
02:17:19,381 --> 02:17:21,872
A free man at the start
of a long journey...

1682
02:17:22,084 --> 02:17:24,678
... whose conclusion is uncertain.

1683
02:17:27,690 --> 02:17:30,352
I hope I can make it across the border.

1684
02:17:31,860 --> 02:17:34,886
I hope to see my friend
and shake his hand.

1685
02:17:36,765 --> 02:17:40,826
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1686
02:17:42,671 --> 02:17:43,865
I hope.
