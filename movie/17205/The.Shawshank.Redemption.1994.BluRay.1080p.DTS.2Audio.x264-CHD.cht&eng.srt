00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,528
德弗瑞恩先生
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

11
00:02:07,529 --> 00:02:11,928
…描述一下你太太被謀殺當晚，你曾和她談過些什麼？
...the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered.

12
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,229
一些很糟糕的話
It was very bitter.

13
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:22,929
她說她很高興我已知道，她不想再偷偷摸摸了
She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around.

14
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:27,931
她說她想離婚
And she said that she wanted a divorce in Reno.

15
00:02:28,031 --> 00:02:31,830
-你當時有什麼反應？ -我對她說我不會在乎的
- What was your response? - I told her I would not grant one.

16
00:02:32,031 --> 00:02:35,431
「在我看見你在雷諾市前，下地獄吧！」
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

17
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:38,732
你的鄰居曾聽你說過這些話吧？
Those were your words, according to your neighbors.

18
00:02:39,832 --> 00:02:41,431
隨他們怎麼說
If they say so.

19
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,732
我當時很不開心，什麼都不記得了
I really don't remember. I was upset.

20
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:47,232
你和太太爭吵後發生了什麼事？
What happened after you argued with your wife?

21
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,132
她收拾好行李
She packed a bag.

22
00:02:51,333 --> 00:02:54,433
到昆汀先生家堨h了
She packed a bag to go and stay with Mr. Quentin.

23
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:59,133
格倫·昆汀，職業高爾夫教練
Glenn Quentin, golf pro at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

24
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:02,534
你知道他是你妻子的情人
... whom you had discovered was your wife's lover.

25
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:06,034
你跟蹤她了嗎？
Did you follow her?

26
00:03:07,434 --> 00:03:09,733
我先去了幾間酒吧找
I went to a few bars first.

27
00:03:09,735 --> 00:03:14,034
接著，我開車去了昆汀家，但他們不在家
Later, I drove to his house to confront them. They weren't home.

28
00:03:14,636 --> 00:03:16,135
我把車停在街角
I parked in the turnout...

29
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:18,035
等在那
... and waited.

30
00:03:18,036 --> 00:03:19,735
有何企圖嗎？
With what intention?

31
00:03:20,336 --> 00:03:21,735
我不太確定
I'm not sure.

32
00:03:22,937 --> 00:03:24,535
我非常困惑
I was confused...

33
00:03:24,536 --> 00:03:25,635
還有點醉
... drunk.

34
00:03:27,137 --> 00:03:28,636
我覺得
I think...

35
00:03:28,637 --> 00:03:30,936
我只是想嚇一嚇他們
... mostly I wanted to scare them.

36
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:34,337
他們到家後，你就進屋殺了他們
When they arrived, you went up to the house and murdered them.

37
00:03:35,338 --> 00:03:36,936
沒有，我控制了自己
I was sobering up.

38
00:03:36,937 --> 00:03:40,737
我開車回家睡覺來忘記一切
I got back in the car and I drove home to sleep it off.

39
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:43,938
在回家的路上，我把槍扔進了河
Along the way, I threw my gun into the Royal River.

40
00:03:43,939 --> 00:03:46,138
我很肯定這一點
I've been very clear on this point.

41
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:50,139
但我感到奇怪的是，第二天早上清潔女工發現……
I get hazy where the cleaning woman shows up the following morning...

42
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,238
你太太和她的情人死在床上
...and finds your wife in bed with her lover...

43
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:55,338
致死的子彈是出自點38口徑的手槍
...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

44
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,739
德福瑞恩先生，你和我一樣都覺得那是巧合嗎？
Does that strike you as a fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,039
確實是巧合
Yes, it does.

46
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,339
你仍堅持說你在兇案發生前
Yet you still maintain you threw your gun into the river...

47
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,639
已經把槍扔進河堣F嗎？
...before the murders took place.

48
00:04:08,641 --> 00:04:10,840
這對你很有利
That's very convenient.

49
00:04:11,141 --> 00:04:12,740
這是事實
It's the truth.

50
00:04:13,142 --> 00:04:17,940
警察在河塈鉹F三天，但他們沒有找到你的槍……
The police dragged that river for three days, and nary a gun was found...

51
00:04:17,941 --> 00:04:21,941
所以無法鑒定
...so no comparison could be made between your gun and the bullets...

52
00:04:22,242 --> 00:04:25,642
死者身上的子彈是否出自你的槍
...taken from the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

53
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:28,741
這對你來說
And that also...

54
00:04:29,143 --> 00:04:32,643
也非常有利，不是嗎，德福瑞恩先生？
...is very convenient. Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

55
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:36,242
因為我是無辜的……
Since I am innocent of this crime...

56
00:04:36,243 --> 00:04:40,842
所以我發現找不到槍對我非常不利
...I find it decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found.

57
00:04:58,745 --> 00:05:02,345
各位先生女士，你們聽到了所有的證據
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard all the evidence.

58
00:05:02,346 --> 00:05:06,346
我們有他犯罪的動機，我們找到他的腳印
We have the accused at the scene of the crime. We have footprints.

59
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:09,446
留有他的指紋的子彈頭
Bullets on the ground bearing his fingerprints.

60
00:05:09,447 --> 00:05:12,546
打碎的酒瓶上也留有他的指紋
A broken bourbon bottle, likewise with fingerprints.

61
00:05:12,547 --> 00:05:14,346
最重要的是
And most of all...

62
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,646
我們知道他的妻子和她的情人
... we have a beautiful young woman and her lover...

63
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:19,646
雙雙倒臥在血泊中
... lying dead in each other's arms.

64
00:05:20,848 --> 00:05:23,447
他們是犯了錯
They had sinned.

65
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:27,447
但他們所犯的錯嚴重到……
But was their crime so great...

66
00:05:27,448 --> 00:05:29,847
……需要用死來贖罪嗎？
... as to merit a death sentence?

67
00:05:29,849 --> 00:05:32,148
當你們考慮時
While you think about that...

68
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:35,448
請想想這個……
...think about this:

69
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:40,248
一個彈匣只能裝六顆子彈，而不是八顆
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

70
00:05:40,249 --> 00:05:44,148
我肯定這不只是一時衝動而犯下的罪行
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded crime of passion.

71
00:05:44,149 --> 00:05:47,149
那至少是可以理解的，即使不能寬恕
That at least could be understood, if not condoned.

72
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:48,349
不！
No.

73
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,449
這是復仇
This was revenge...

74
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:54,349
一個冷血者的復仇，看看這些：
...of a much more brutal, cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

75
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:56,750
每個死者都身中四槍
Four bullets per victim.

76
00:05:57,451 --> 00:05:59,250
總共是八槍而不是六槍
Not six shots fired, but eight.

77
00:05:59,752 --> 00:06:03,551
那表明子彈打完後
That means that he fired the gun empty...

78
00:06:03,552 --> 00:06:05,451
他還停下來裝子彈
... and then stopped to reload...

79
00:06:05,752 --> 00:06:09,351
以便再次向他們開槍
... so that he could shoot each of them again.

80
00:06:09,352 --> 00:06:11,951
每人多加一槍
An extra bullet per lover...

81
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:14,451
就在頭部
... right in the head.

82
00:06:17,953 --> 00:06:22,752
德弗瑞恩先生，我覺得你非常冷血
You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

83
00:06:23,254 --> 00:06:25,353
看著你都令我毛骨聳然
It chills my blood just to look at you.

84
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:30,253
我以本州賦予我的權利
By the power vested in me by the state of Maine...

85
00:06:30,254 --> 00:06:34,553
判處你兩項終身監禁
...I hereby order you to serve two life sentences back-to-back...

86
00:06:34,855 --> 00:06:37,454
分別為兩位死者，退庭！
...one for each of your victims. So be it!

87
00:07:02,557 --> 00:07:03,756
坐下來
Sit.

88
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:11,057
你因被判終身監禁己在此二十年？
We see you've served 20 years of a life sentence?

89
00:07:12,058 --> 00:07:15,258
-是的，先生 -你感到後悔嗎？
- Yes, sir. - You feel you've been rehabilitated?

90
00:07:15,658 --> 00:07:18,257
是的，絕對有，先生
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

91
00:07:19,359 --> 00:07:21,358
我是說，我得到了教訓
I mean, I learned my lesson.

92
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,860
我敢說我已經完全改變了
I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.

93
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:31,659
我不會再危害社會
I'm no longer a danger to society.

94
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:33,659
這是神的真理
That's God's honest truth.

95
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,059
「不合格」

96
00:08:09,964 --> 00:08:11,463
嗨，瑞德
Hey, Red.

97
00:08:11,464 --> 00:08:12,963
怎麼樣了？
How'd it go?

98
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:15,363
不同的日子，同樣的結果
Same old shit, different day.

99
00:08:15,364 --> 00:08:17,463
我知道你的感受的
Yeah, I know how you feel.

100
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,463
我下星期又要被否決了
I'm up for rejection next week.

101
00:08:20,265 --> 00:08:22,964
對，我上星期也被否決了
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

102
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:24,464
一向如此
It happens.

103
00:08:24,466 --> 00:08:26,064
嗨，瑞德，給我一包煙
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

104
00:08:26,065 --> 00:08:29,365
滾開！你已欠我五包煙了
Get out of my face, man! You're into me for five packs already.

105
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:30,564
-是四包！ -五包！
Four!

106
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:35,365
我想在美國的每個聯邦或州監獄堻ㄕ章釦琱@樣的人物
There must be a con like me in every prison in America.

107
00:08:35,366 --> 00:08:37,365
就是能夠給你搞到東西的傢伙
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

108
00:08:37,366 --> 00:08:40,666
定制的香煙，一包大麻……
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer, if that's your thing...

109
00:08:40,667 --> 00:08:44,366
為慶祝你兒子或女兒高中畢業的一瓶白蘭地， 只要你喜歡
... bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation.

110
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:46,666
或者幾乎所有東西……
Damn near anything within reason.

111
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:50,367
是的，先生，我是個冷酷的人
Yes, sir! I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

112
00:08:53,368 --> 00:08:56,467
所以1949年當安迪·德福瑞恩來找我
So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949...

113
00:08:56,468 --> 00:09:00,268
問能否弄張麗塔·海華絲的圖片進來時 （麗塔·海華絲：Rita，Hayworth）
... and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

114
00:09:00,269 --> 00:09:02,468
我告訴他沒問題
... I told him, "No problem."

115
00:09:44,373 --> 00:09:46,772
安迪·杜福雷在1947年來到肖申克監獄
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

116
00:09:46,773 --> 00:09:50,673
罪名是謀殺他的妻子和她的情人
... in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was banging.

117
00:09:50,974 --> 00:09:54,974
入獄以前，他是波特蘭銀行的副總裁
On the outside, he'd been vice president of a large Portland bank.

118
00:09:55,473 --> 00:09:57,272
對他來說是年青有為
Good work for a man so young.

119
00:10:02,473 --> 00:10:03,672
好啊，瑞德

120
00:10:40,579 --> 00:10:42,477
你會說英語嗎？
You speak English, butt-steak?

121
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:44,377
跟著這個長官走
You follow this officer.

122
00:10:57,179 --> 00:11:01,179
我一生中從沒見過這麼差勁的人
I never seen such a sorry-Iooking heap of maggot shit in all my life.

123
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,279
過來啊！到這堥
Hey, fish! Come over here!

124
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:28,881
今天要賭嗎，瑞德？
Taking bets today, Red?

125
00:11:29,283 --> 00:11:31,182
賭煙還是賭錢？
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

126
00:11:31,183 --> 00:11:32,882
香煙，我賭兩根
Smokes. Put me down for two.

127
00:11:33,383 --> 00:11:35,182
好吧，你買哪一個？
All right, who's your horse?

128
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:36,982
那個又矮又瘦的
That little sack of shit.

129
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,983
-排在第八的，他會是第一個的 -媽的！我也想買他
- Eighth. He'll be first. - Bullshit! I'll take that action.

130
00:11:41,984 --> 00:11:44,383
你輸定了，孩子
You're out some smokes, son.

131
00:11:44,384 --> 00:11:46,383
該你下注了
If you're so smart, you call it.

132
00:11:46,385 --> 00:11:49,684
我買那邊的那個胖子
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

133
00:11:49,685 --> 00:11:52,284
排在第五的那個，我賭四根香煙
The fifth one. Put me down for a quarter deck.

134
00:11:55,485 --> 00:11:57,184
今天又有新人
Fresh fish today!

135
00:11:57,986 --> 00:11:59,485
我們又有的玩了
We're reeling them in!

136
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:03,785
我承認我初次見到安迪的時候，沒什麼特別的感覺
I admit I didn't think much of Andy first time I laid eyes on him.

137
00:12:04,286 --> 00:12:07,185
他看起來似乎風一吹就會倒
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

138
00:12:07,586 --> 00:12:09,885
這就是我對他的第一印象
That was my first impression of the man.

139
00:12:09,887 --> 00:12:11,485
你買誰？
What do you say?

140
00:12:11,486 --> 00:12:14,986
那個高個子
That tall drink of water with the silver spoon up his ass.

141
00:12:14,987 --> 00:12:17,386
那個人？不可能的
That guy? Never happen.

142
00:12:17,387 --> 00:12:19,786
-我賭十根香煙 -那可是大賭注
- 10 cigarettes. - That's a rich bet.

143
00:12:19,787 --> 00:12:22,086
誰來證明我看錯了？
Who's going to prove me wrong?

144
00:12:22,088 --> 00:12:23,887
海伍德？濟格？
Heywood? Jigger?

145
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:25,687
史基？
Skeets?

146
00:12:25,688 --> 00:12:26,987
弗洛德？
Floyd!

147
00:12:27,988 --> 00:12:29,987
四個膽小鬼
Four brave souls.

148
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:33,188
回囚房去，要查房了
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

149
00:12:33,189 --> 00:12:36,489
所有犯人都回囚房去
All prisoners, return to your cellblocks.

150
00:12:56,891 --> 00:12:58,190
向右轉
Turn to the right!

151
00:12:58,191 --> 00:12:59,490
往前看
Eyes front.

152
00:13:12,593 --> 00:13:15,392
這是哈德利先生，他是這堛漪搹u長
This is Mr. Hadley. He's captain of the guards.

153
00:13:15,393 --> 00:13:17,692
我是諾頓，這堛漕摨貌
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

154
00:13:17,693 --> 00:13:19,892
你們都被判有罪了
You are convicted felons.

155
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:22,192
因此被送到這堥
That's why they've sent you to me.

156
00:13:22,793 --> 00:13:24,392
規則一
Rule number one:

157
00:13:24,394 --> 00:13:25,893
不得褻瀆上帝
No blasphemy.

158
00:13:26,394 --> 00:13:29,993
在我的監獄堣ㄠo有人褻瀆上帝
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain in my prison.

159
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,393
其他的條例……
The other rules...

160
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:34,694
其他的條例，你們慢慢就會知道了，還有問題嗎？
...you'll figure out as you go along. Any questions?

161
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:36,194
何時吃飯？
When do we eat?

162
00:13:44,896 --> 00:13:47,095
我們叫你吃的時候你就吃
You eat when we say you eat.

163
00:13:47,096 --> 00:13:50,595
叫你去廁所你就去廁所
You shit when we say you shit, and piss when we say you piss.

164
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:53,395
明白嗎？笨蛋？
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

165
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:56,795
站好
On your feet.

166
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:58,796
我只相信兩樣東西
I believe in two things:

167
00:13:58,797 --> 00:14:01,296
紀律和聖經
Discipline and the Bible.

168
00:14:01,798 --> 00:14:03,797
在這堙A你們兩樣都有
Here, you'll receive both.

169
00:14:04,598 --> 00:14:06,797
把你們的思想交給上帝
Put your trust in the Lord.

170
00:14:07,397 --> 00:14:09,596
你們的身體交給我
Your ass belongs to me.

171
00:14:11,498 --> 00:14:13,397
歡迎來到肖申克監獄
Welcome to Shawshank.

172
00:14:18,499 --> 00:14:19,898
解開他們
Unhook them.

173
00:14:25,299 --> 00:14:26,698
轉過身
Turn around.

174
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,999
夠了
That's enough.

175
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:37,899
到籠子邊上去
Move to the end of the cage.

176
00:14:38,901 --> 00:14:41,400
轉身，給他消毒
Turn around. Delouse him.

177
00:14:43,602 --> 00:14:44,801
轉身
Turn around.

178
00:14:47,702 --> 00:14:50,601
出來，去領你們的衣服和聖經
Move out of the cage. Pick up your clothes and Bible.

179
00:14:50,602 --> 00:14:51,901
下一個！
Next man up!

180
00:14:54,202 --> 00:14:55,801
往右走
To the right.

181
00:14:55,803 --> 00:14:56,902
右邊，右邊
Right. Right.

182
00:14:57,502 --> 00:14:58,701
左邊
Left.

183
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:02,903
毫無疑問，第一晚是最難熬的
The first night's the toughest. No doubt about it.

184
00:15:03,303 --> 00:15:06,702
赤裸裸的進囚籠，就像剛出生時那樣
They march you in naked as the day you were born...

185
00:15:06,703 --> 00:15:10,503
消毒藥粉令皮膚像被火燒一樣
... skin burning and half-blind from that delousing shit.

186
00:15:11,104 --> 00:15:13,703
他們把你丟進囚籠
And when they put you in that cell...

187
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:16,103
關上鐵門
... and those bars slam home...

188
00:15:16,605 --> 00:15:18,704
那時你才感到這是真實的
... that's when you know it's for real.

189
00:15:19,405 --> 00:15:22,405
瞬間過去的一切都離你而去
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

190
00:15:22,905 --> 00:15:26,905
剩下的只有對過去的回憶
Nothing left but all the time in the world to think about it.

191
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:31,406
很多新來的人在第一晚都幾乎發瘋了
Most new fish come close to madness the first night.

192
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,705
有些人甚至還痛哭流涕
Somebody always breaks down crying.

193
00:15:35,206 --> 00:15:36,905
一向都如此的
Happens every time.

194
00:15:37,806 --> 00:15:39,805
唯一的問題是
The only question is...

195
00:15:39,807 --> 00:15:41,506
誰會是第一個呢？
... who's it going to be?

196
00:15:42,907 --> 00:15:45,907
我想那是用來賭博的最佳玩意
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

197
00:15:46,907 --> 00:15:49,606
我把賭注押在杜福雷身上
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

198
00:15:58,608 --> 00:16:00,307
熄燈
Lights out!

199
00:16:20,811 --> 00:16:23,110
我還記得我在這堛熔臚@晚
I remember my first night.

200
00:16:24,011 --> 00:16:26,910
似乎是很久以前的事了
Seems like a long time ago.

201
00:16:30,212 --> 00:16:31,811
嗨，新來的
Hey, fish.

202
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:34,611
新來的
Fish, fish.

203
00:16:36,212 --> 00:16:37,911
你怕黑嗎？
What are you, scared of the dark?

204
00:16:40,312 --> 00:16:43,211
我打賭，你希望你爸和你媽從沒把你生下來
Bet you wish your daddy never dicked your mama!

205
00:16:43,213 --> 00:16:46,613
蠢豬！
Piggy! Pork! I want me a pork chop.

206
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:58,214
他們總是喜歡逗新人
The boys always go fishing with first-timers.

207
00:16:58,514 --> 00:17:01,514
不達目的，誓不罷休
And they don't quit till they reel someone in.

208
00:17:02,915 --> 00:17:04,514
嗨，胖子
Hey, Fat Ass.

209
00:17:06,015 --> 00:17:07,314
胖子！
Fat Ass!

210
00:17:08,515 --> 00:17:10,214
聊天吧
Talk to me, boy.

211
00:17:11,216 --> 00:17:13,814
我知道你在那堙A我能聽見你的呼吸聲
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

212
00:17:13,815 --> 00:17:17,015
別理別人怎麼說，你聽到嗎？
Don't you listen to these nitwits, you hear me?

213
00:17:17,016 --> 00:17:18,915
這地方沒那麼差勁
This place ain't so bad.

214
00:17:19,316 --> 00:17:20,515
這樣吧
Tell you what...

215
00:17:21,816 --> 00:17:24,916
我介紹你認識他們，就像一家人
...I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home.

216
00:17:25,516 --> 00:17:28,715
我知道有幾個人
I know a couple of big old bull queers that'd just...

217
00:17:28,716 --> 00:17:30,915
會很樂意認識你的
...Iove to make your acquaintance.

218
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:34,317
尤其是你那又白又嫩的屁股
Especially that big, white, mushy butt of yours.

219
00:17:34,617 --> 00:17:35,616
天啊！
God!

220
00:17:36,318 --> 00:17:37,917
我不屬於這
I don't belong here!

221
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:41,017
-嗨，有人贏了 -我要回家
- We have a winner! - I want to go home!

222
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:43,717
是胖子
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

223
00:17:46,518 --> 00:17:48,217
新人！
Fresh fish!

224
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:56,218
我要回家
I want to go home!

225
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:58,619
我要見我媽媽
I want my mother!

226
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,819
我操過你媽媽！她不怎麼樣
I had your mother! She wasn't that great!

227
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,420
發生了什麼事？
What the Christ is this horseshit?

228
00:18:07,421 --> 00:18:09,720
他講粗話，我要告訴典獄官
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

229
00:18:09,721 --> 00:18:12,320
告訴他我操你屁股吧
You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!

230
00:18:12,321 --> 00:18:13,320
讓我出去
Let me out!

231
00:18:13,322 --> 00:18:16,921
胖子，你想怎麼樣？
What is your malfunction, you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

232
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:19,922
求求你！我不該在這堛
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

233
00:18:20,422 --> 00:18:21,721
不該是我
Not me!

234
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:24,221
我不會警告你的
I won't count to three. Not even to one.

235
00:18:24,222 --> 00:18:26,321
馬上你閉上你的臭嘴，否則有你受的！
You shut up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

236
00:18:26,822 --> 00:18:29,521
-閉嘴，閉嘴 -求求你……
Shut up, man. Shut up!

237
00:18:30,223 --> 00:18:33,122
你不明白的，我不該在這堛
You don't understand. I'm not supposed to be here.

238
00:18:33,123 --> 00:18:34,622
把囚籠打開
Open that cell.

239
00:18:34,623 --> 00:18:37,923
我也是！這堻Q他們弄得就像監獄
Me neither! They run this place like a fucking prison!

240
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:47,423
狗娘養的
Son of a bitch!

241
00:18:52,325 --> 00:18:54,624
長官，算了
Captain, take it easy!

242
00:19:17,027 --> 00:19:20,526
如果我今晚聽到有半點聲音
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here tonight...

243
00:19:20,527 --> 00:19:23,927
我對天發誓，你們會吃不了兜著走
...I swear by God and Jesus, you will all visit the infirmary.

244
00:19:24,428 --> 00:19:26,827
所有的人都不會放過的
Every last motherfucker in here.

245
00:19:30,229 --> 00:19:33,829
把他抬到醫療室去
Call the trustees. Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

246
00:19:48,231 --> 00:19:53,029
德福瑞恩第一晚就讓我輸了兩包煙
His first night in the joint, Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

247
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:56,030
他整晚一言不發
He never made a sound.

248
00:20:11,432 --> 00:20:13,731
北倉三樓，出來
Tier 3 north, clear count!

249
00:20:14,633 --> 00:20:16,432
北倉二樓，出來
Tier 2 north, clear count.

250
00:20:17,033 --> 00:20:19,332
南倉三樓，出來
Tier 3 south, clear.

251
00:20:24,234 --> 00:20:25,733
準備出來放風
Prepare to roll out.

252
00:20:29,334 --> 00:20:30,833
出去！
Roll out!

253
00:21:24,839 --> 00:21:26,938
你準備吃那個嗎？
Are you going to eat that?

254
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,939
不，我沒這打算
I hadn't planned on it.

255
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:32,239
你介意嗎？
Do you mind?

256
00:21:40,741 --> 00:21:42,140
你真不錯
That's nice and ripe.

257
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:55,941
傑克說謝謝你
Jake says thank you.

258
00:21:56,542 --> 00:21:59,642
它從巢堭慾U來了
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

259
00:22:01,143 --> 00:22:04,443
我要照顧它直到它會飛為止
I'm going to look after him until he's big enough to fly.

260
00:22:05,943 --> 00:22:07,442
不！他過來了
Oh, no! Here he comes.

261
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:12,143
早上好，各位
Morning, fellas.

262
00:22:12,444 --> 00:22:14,343
不錯的早晨，不是嗎？
Fine morning, isn't it?

263
00:22:14,644 --> 00:22:17,143
你們知道我的意思的，對嗎？
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

264
00:22:17,144 --> 00:22:19,643
把它們拿出來，把它們排成排……
Send them down. I want them lined up...

265
00:22:19,645 --> 00:22:22,244
非常誘人的一行
...just like a pretty little chorus line.

266
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:24,544
看看這個
Look at that.

267
00:22:25,046 --> 00:22:28,246
我真受不了了
- I can't stand this guy. - Oh, Lord!

268
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:31,645
瑞查德、維吉尼亞……
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

269
00:22:31,646 --> 00:22:33,145
聞我的屁吧
Smell my ass!

270
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:35,145
再聞聞我的
After he smells mine.

271
00:22:35,646 --> 00:22:39,545
很遺憾，你下注的那個輸了
That's a shame about your horse coming in last and all.

272
00:22:39,546 --> 00:22:42,546
但我很喜歡我下注的那個人
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine, though.

273
00:22:42,547 --> 00:22:45,046
我見到他就要親他一下
I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.

274
00:22:45,748 --> 00:22:49,748
你為何不把香煙分給他點？
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

275
00:22:50,247 --> 00:22:51,746
嗨，利奧
Hey, Tyrell.

276
00:22:52,148 --> 00:22:54,147
這周你在醫療室當值是嗎？
You pull infirmary duty this week?

277
00:22:55,048 --> 00:22:56,647
我下注的那個怎麼樣了？
How's my horse doing anyway?

278
00:22:57,048 --> 00:22:58,147
死了
Dead.

279
00:22:59,048 --> 00:23:01,447
哈德利打爆了他的頭
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

280
00:23:01,449 --> 00:23:03,648
晚上醫生都回家了
Doc had gone home for the night.

281
00:23:04,149 --> 00:23:06,648
可憐的傢伙就在那婼魒鴞迨W
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

282
00:23:06,649 --> 00:23:09,048
可是那時我們已經無能為力了
By then, there wasn't nothing we could do.

283
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,649
他叫什麼？
What was his name?

284
00:23:20,050 --> 00:23:21,349
你說什麼？
What'd you say?

285
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:25,649
我只是想問有人知道他的名字嗎？
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

286
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:29,050
關你屁事，新來的？
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

287
00:23:30,052 --> 00:23:33,152
他叫什麼都無所謂了，他已經死了
Doesn't fucking matter what his name was. He's dead.

288
00:23:55,254 --> 00:23:57,253
嗨，有人和你一起嗎？
Anybody come at you yet?

289
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:01,253
有人喜歡你嗎？
Anybody get to you yet?

290
00:24:02,855 --> 00:24:05,454
嗨，在這塈畯抭˙搨n朋友
Hey, we all need friends in here.

291
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:07,354
我可以做你的朋友
I could be a friend to you.

292
00:24:16,655 --> 00:24:18,054
難得手
Hard to get.

293
00:24:20,156 --> 00:24:21,655
我喜歡
I like that.

294
00:24:28,557 --> 00:24:31,757
安迪一開始很自閉
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

295
00:24:32,158 --> 00:24:34,057
我猜他在想辦法
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

296
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,356
接受牢堛漸肮
... trying to adapt to life on the inside.

297
00:24:38,058 --> 00:24:41,258
一個月以後他才開口
Wasn't until a month went by before he opened his mouth...

298
00:24:41,558 --> 00:24:43,857
和某人談話
... to say more than two words to somebody.

299
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:46,658
就像你們所看見的
As it turned out...

300
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:48,958
那個人就是我
... that somebody was me.

301
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,559
我是安迪·德福瑞恩
I'm Andy Dufresne.

302
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:02,459
殺妻的銀行家
Wife-killing banker.

303
00:25:04,761 --> 00:25:06,060
你為何要殺你的妻子？
Why'd you do it?

304
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:08,559
我沒有殺她
I didn't, since you ask.

305
00:25:09,161 --> 00:25:10,960
你很適應合這
You're going to fit right in.

306
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:13,860
這兒每個人都是無辜的，你不知道嗎？
Everybody in here's innocent. Didn't you know that?

307
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:17,761
-你為進監獄？ -我什麼都沒做，律師害了我
- What you in here for? - Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

308
00:25:20,762 --> 00:25:23,561
聽說你很冷酷
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

309
00:25:23,562 --> 00:25:27,361
你以為自己很了不起，對嗎？
You think your shit smells sweeter than most. Is that right?

310
00:25:27,362 --> 00:25:28,861
你怎麼認為呢？
What do you think?

311
00:25:29,163 --> 00:25:32,263
說實話，我還不知道
To tell you the truth, I haven't made up my mind.

312
00:25:33,363 --> 00:25:36,162
我知道你能拿到違禁品
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

313
00:25:37,164 --> 00:25:40,663
我能搞到
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time.

314
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:43,263
你能給我個鶴嘴槌嗎？
I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.

315
00:25:43,964 --> 00:25:45,263
鶴嘴槌
A rock hammer.

316
00:25:45,564 --> 00:25:48,263
-要幹什麼？ -你關心這個幹嗎？
- What is it and why? - What do you care?

317
00:25:49,665 --> 00:25:52,564
如果是牙刷我就不會問你，我會開個價錢
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask. I'd quote a price.

318
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:54,964
但是牙刷沒有殺傷力，對嗎？
But a toothbrush is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

319
00:25:56,565 --> 00:25:57,964
有道理
Fair enough.

320
00:25:58,366 --> 00:26:01,265
一個鶴嘴槌有六至七英吋長
A rock hammer is about six or seven inches long.

321
00:26:01,266 --> 00:26:03,765
-看起來像個小鋤子 -鋤子？
- Looks like a miniature pickax. - Pickax?

322
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:04,966
打石用的
For rocks.

323
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:08,766
-石英 -石英？
Quartz?

324
00:26:12,767 --> 00:26:16,167
還有雲母、頁岩……
And some mica, shale...

325
00:26:17,467 --> 00:26:18,666
石灰岩……
...limestone.

326
00:26:18,968 --> 00:26:20,067
這麼說吧
So?

327
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:22,866
我收集石頭
So I'm a rock hound.

328
00:26:23,268 --> 00:26:26,368
我想在這堻怳j限度的重操舊業
At least I was in my old life. I'd like to be again.

329
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,768
或許你想用它們攻擊某人
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy into somebody's skull.

330
00:26:31,269 --> 00:26:33,067
不，我在這堥S有敵人
No, I have no enemies here.

331
00:26:33,068 --> 00:26:35,367
不會？等著瞧吧
No? Wait a while.

332
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:38,568
話說回來
Word gets around.

333
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:41,768
那對姐妹花很喜歡你
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

334
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,869
特別是伯格斯
Especially Bogs.

335
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:49,569
就算跟他們說我不好此道也沒用
Don't suppose it would help if I told them I'm not homosexual.

336
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,169
他們也不是
Neither are they.

337
00:26:51,171 --> 00:26:54,671
是這個地方讓他們這樣
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

338
00:26:59,171 --> 00:27:03,770
畜牲只知道用暴力，不管他人喜不喜歡
Bull queers take by force. That's all they want or understand.

339
00:27:03,772 --> 00:27:07,471
如果我是你，我會加倍小心
If I were you, I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

340
00:27:07,472 --> 00:27:10,271
-謝謝你的忠告 -忠告免費
- Thanks for the advice. - Well, that's free.

341
00:27:10,572 --> 00:27:12,771
你知道我擔心什麼
You understand my concern.

342
00:27:12,773 --> 00:27:15,372
就算我有麻煩也不會用鶴嘴槌的
If there's trouble, I won't use the rock hammer.

343
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:20,273
那我猜你想挖個洞逃出去
Then I'd guess you want to escape. Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

344
00:27:21,174 --> 00:27:22,873
我說漏了什麼？什麼東西這麼好笑
What did I miss? What's so funny?

345
00:27:23,273 --> 00:27:25,972
等你看見鶴嘴槌你就明白了
You'll understand when you see the rock hammer.

346
00:27:27,874 --> 00:27:30,273
買這個東西一般要多少錢？
What's an item like this usually go for?

347
00:27:30,275 --> 00:27:32,774
七美元，五金鋪的零售價
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

348
00:27:33,275 --> 00:27:35,974
我一般要加20%
My normal markup's 20 percent.

349
00:27:35,975 --> 00:27:38,574
但這東西很特殊
But this is a specialty item.

350
00:27:38,576 --> 00:27:43,174
風險越大，價錢越高，一口價，10元吧
Risk goes up, price goes up. Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

351
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:44,574
就10元吧
Ten it is.

352
00:27:46,276 --> 00:27:48,275
你那是浪費錢
Waste of money, if you ask me.

353
00:27:48,576 --> 00:27:49,875
為什麼？
Why's that?

354
00:27:51,276 --> 00:27:54,276
這堛漱H喜歡突擊檢查
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

355
00:27:55,876 --> 00:27:58,075
他們找到鶴嘴槌就會被充公
They find it, you're going to lose it.

356
00:27:58,077 --> 00:28:00,376
被他們發現的話，你別把我供出來
If they catch you, you don't know me.

357
00:28:00,377 --> 00:28:06,178
否則的話就別想再和我做生意了，你明白了嗎？
Mention my name, we never do business again.

358
00:28:02,996 --> 00:28:06,090
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum. Now you got that?

359
00:28:07,078 --> 00:28:08,577
我知道了
I understand.

360
00:28:09,878 --> 00:28:12,177
謝謝你，你叫……
Thank you, Mr...

361
00:28:12,178 --> 00:28:13,177
瑞德
Red.

362
00:28:13,878 --> 00:28:15,177
都叫我瑞德
Name's Red.

363
00:28:16,678 --> 00:28:18,277
這名字怎麼來的？
Why do they call you that?

364
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:24,078
可能因為我是半個愛爾蘭人吧
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

365
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:35,079
我現在明白他們為何看中他了
I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby.

366
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:38,380
他不太說話
He had a quiet way about him...

367
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:42,781
一舉一動都不像普通的人
... a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here.

368
00:28:43,281 --> 00:28:44,880
他漫步著
He strolled...

369
00:28:44,881 --> 00:28:48,881
就像在公園奡疏B
... like a man in the park without a care or a worry in the world.

370
00:28:49,281 --> 00:28:53,980
像穿了件隱形的外套
Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place.

371
00:28:55,883 --> 00:28:58,382
可以說
I think it'd be fair to say...

372
00:28:58,383 --> 00:29:00,682
開始我對安迪就有好感
... I liked Andy from the start.

373
00:29:02,183 --> 00:29:05,983
快點！我趕時間的
Let's go! Some of us got a schedule to keep.

374
00:29:09,383 --> 00:29:11,782
快點
Move it! Come on, move it!

375
00:29:14,484 --> 00:29:17,383
你太太對你好嗎？
How you doing? How's the wife treating you?

376
00:29:55,488 --> 00:29:57,187
安迪說得很對
Andy was right.

377
00:29:57,188 --> 00:29:59,487
我最終拿到那玩意
I finally got the joke.

378
00:29:59,788 --> 00:30:02,387
用這東西來挖隧道
It would take a man about 600 years...

379
00:30:02,389 --> 00:30:04,788
起碼要花六百年
... to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

380
00:30:08,589 --> 00:30:10,988
-要書嗎？ -今天不用了
- Book? - Not today.

381
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,089
要書嗎？
Book?

382
00:30:25,391 --> 00:30:27,590
送到德福瑞恩那堨h
Delivery for Dufresne.

383
00:30:45,293 --> 00:30:46,892
德福瑞恩，這是你要的書
Here's your book.

384
00:30:51,894 --> 00:30:53,093
謝謝
Thanks.

385
00:30:59,394 --> 00:31:03,094
漂白粉不夠用了，你再去後面拿點來
We're running low on hexite. Get on back and fetch us up some.

386
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,997
這可以弄瞎你的眼睛
This will blind you.

387
00:31:42,298 --> 00:31:44,697
親愛的
Honey, hush.

388
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,499
你不懂
That's it. You fight!

389
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,899
你越掙扎越過癮
Better that way.

390
00:32:09,201 --> 00:32:12,500
我很想說安迪打贏了
I wish I could tell you Andy fought the good fight...

391
00:32:12,501 --> 00:32:14,500
或者姐妹花放過了他
... and the Sisters let him be.

392
00:32:15,001 --> 00:32:17,100
我希望能這麼說
I wish I could tell you that...

393
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:20,001
但是監獄不是童話世界
... but prison is no fairy-tale world.

394
00:32:21,202 --> 00:32:23,101
他從沒提起是誰
He never said who did it.

395
00:32:23,402 --> 00:32:25,001
但我們都很清楚
But we all knew.

396
00:32:29,803 --> 00:32:32,302
事情就這樣持續了一段時間
Things went on like that for a while.

397
00:32:32,703 --> 00:32:35,202
監獄堛漸肮○ㄛO常規
Prison life consists of routine...

398
00:32:35,503 --> 00:32:37,502
和更多的常規
... and then more routine.

399
00:32:40,003 --> 00:32:43,503
安迪的臉上經常出現新的傷痕
Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

400
00:32:45,004 --> 00:32:47,003
姐妹花不斷地騷擾他
The Sisters kept at him.

401
00:32:47,005 --> 00:32:49,304
有時候他能逃脫
Sometimes he was able to fight them off.

402
00:32:49,305 --> 00:32:50,804
但有時不能
Sometimes not.

403
00:32:52,004 --> 00:32:54,103
對安迪來說
And that's how it went for Andy.

404
00:32:54,705 --> 00:32:56,504
這已經成了他的常規
That was his routine.

405
00:32:57,305 --> 00:33:00,705
我相信最初的兩年是最糟糕的
I do believe those first two years were the worst for him.

406
00:33:01,206 --> 00:33:04,606
我也相信事情再繼續這樣下去
And I also believe that if things had gone on that way...

407
00:33:05,006 --> 00:33:07,405
這個地方會奪去他的精神
... this place would have got the best of him.

408
00:33:08,207 --> 00:33:11,206
但是，在1949年的春天
But then, in the spring of 1949...

409
00:33:11,207 --> 00:33:13,306
上頭決定……
... the powers that be decided:

410
00:33:13,307 --> 00:33:16,806
工廠的屋頂需要重修
The roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing.

411
00:33:16,807 --> 00:33:20,007
我需要12名自願者工作一星期
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

412
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,206
你們知道的
As you know...

413
00:33:22,908 --> 00:33:26,707
特殊的工作有特殊的好處
...special detail carries with it special privileges.

414
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:29,107
這是戶外勞動
It was outdoor detail...

415
00:33:29,508 --> 00:33:33,508
五月是戶外勞動的好時間
... and May is one damned fine month to be working outdoors.

416
00:33:34,009 --> 00:33:35,508
排好隊
Stay in line there.

417
00:33:35,509 --> 00:33:38,709
超過100人報名參加勞動
More than a hundred men volunteered for the job.

418
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,909
威勒斯·E·安戈……
Wallace E. Unger.

419
00:33:46,510 --> 00:33:49,009
艾力斯·瑞丁……
Ellis Redding.

420
00:33:49,011 --> 00:33:50,610
你明白了吧？
Wouldn't you know it?

421
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:54,510
我和幾個我認識的都被選中了
Me and some fellows I know were among the names called.

422
00:33:54,511 --> 00:33:56,510
安迪·德福瑞恩……
Andrew Dufresne.

423
00:33:56,911 --> 00:33:59,911
這只花了我們每人一包煙的代價
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

424
00:34:00,412 --> 00:34:03,010
我當然也像往常一樣賺了20%
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

425
00:34:03,011 --> 00:34:06,711
德州的律師打長途給我
So this big-shot lawyer calls me long-distance from Texas.

426
00:34:06,712 --> 00:34:08,511
我說，「喂？」
I say, "Yeah?"

427
00:34:08,512 --> 00:34:12,412
他說，「很遺憾，你哥哥死了」
He says, " Sorry to inform you, but your brother just died."

428
00:34:12,413 --> 00:34:16,413
-我很難過 -我並不難過，他是個混蛋
- I'm sorry to hear that. - I'm not. He was an asshole.

429
00:34:16,513 --> 00:34:18,912
離家多年，早就當他死了
Ran off years ago. Figured him for dead.

430
00:34:18,913 --> 00:34:21,412
這個律師對我說
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

431
00:34:21,414 --> 00:34:25,414
「他死的時候很富有」，有價值超過百萬的油井
"He died a rich man." Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

432
00:34:26,214 --> 00:34:28,113
超過百萬的？
A million bucks?

433
00:34:28,414 --> 00:34:32,913
-有些混蛋的運氣有時候就是好 -有你的份嗎？
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get. - You going to see any of that?

434
00:34:33,515 --> 00:34:36,414
三萬五千塊 那就他留給我的
Thirty-five thousand. That's what he left me.

435
00:34:36,415 --> 00:34:37,614
-美元？ -對
Dollars?

436
00:34:38,415 --> 00:34:41,415
真不錯，就像中了彩
That's great! That's like winning the sweepstakes.

437
00:34:41,716 --> 00:34:43,015
不是嗎？
Isn't it?

438
00:34:43,016 --> 00:34:46,215
笨蛋，你想政府會如何對我？
Dumb shit, what do you think the government will do to me?

439
00:34:46,216 --> 00:34:48,615
他們會拿去一大半
Take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.

440
00:34:49,316 --> 00:34:50,715
可憐的布朗
Poor Byron.

441
00:34:51,616 --> 00:34:54,916
真是走運，嗯？奇恥大辱
Terrible fucking luck, huh? Crying shame.

442
00:34:54,917 --> 00:34:57,216
有些人覺得很糟糕
Some people really got it awful.

443
00:34:57,517 --> 00:34:59,016
安迪，你傻了嗎？
Andy, are you nuts?

444
00:34:59,017 --> 00:35:01,116
看著你的拖把，嘿！
IKeep your eyes on your mop, man!

445
00:35:01,117 --> 00:35:04,316
雖然要交點稅，但你還可以……
You'll pay some tax, but you'll still end up...

446
00:35:04,317 --> 00:35:07,317
也許夠買輛新車，但接著呢？
Yeah, maybe enough to buy a new car, and then what?

447
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:09,717
你必須為新車上該死的稅，維修和保養
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

448
00:35:09,718 --> 00:35:13,418
孩子們會纏著你帶著他們兜風
...maintenance, kids pestering you to take them for a ride all the time.

449
00:35:13,718 --> 00:35:17,318
如果年底算錯了稅金，還要掏自己的腰包
Then if you figure your tax wrong, you pay out of your own pocket.

450
00:35:17,619 --> 00:35:19,918
告訴你！山姆叔叔
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

451
00:35:19,919 --> 00:35:23,919
他只是假仁假義
He puts his hand in your shirt and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

452
00:35:26,620 --> 00:35:28,719
他在找死，繼續幹活吧
- Getting himself killed. - IKeep tarring.

453
00:35:29,019 --> 00:35:31,518
什麼兄弟，呸！
Some brother. Shit!

454
00:35:36,421 --> 00:35:37,820
哈德利先生
Mr. Hadley...

455
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:40,120
你信任你太太嗎？
...do you trust your wife?

456
00:35:41,721 --> 00:35:43,220
噢，這很有趣
Oh, that's funny.

457
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:46,520
你給我挨揍的話也許更有趣
You'll look funnier sucking my dick with no teeth.

458
00:35:46,521 --> 00:35:49,921
我是說，你是否會認為她對你不忠？
What I mean is, do you think she'd go behind your back?

459
00:35:51,022 --> 00:35:54,621
讓開點，米特，讓他自己出意外
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's having himself an accident.

460
00:35:54,622 --> 00:35:55,621
他會把他推下去的
He'll push him off!

461
00:35:55,923 --> 00:35:57,722
如果你信任她，你就能……
If you trust her, you can keep...

462
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:59,421
……拿到三萬五千元
...that 35,000.

463
00:36:00,123 --> 00:36:02,622
-你說什麼？ -三萬五千元
- What did you say? - Thirty-five thousand.

464
00:36:03,423 --> 00:36:04,722
一分不少
All of it.

465
00:36:04,724 --> 00:36:07,923
你最好說明白點，小子，不然你完蛋了
- Every penny. - You better start making sense.

466
00:36:07,924 --> 00:36:10,523
你要拿到這筆錢的話，就把它送給你妻子
If you want to keep it, give it to your wife.

467
00:36:10,524 --> 00:36:14,524
政府允許一次性贈與配偶金額的上限是六萬美元
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift to your spouse for up to $ 60,000.

468
00:36:14,624 --> 00:36:17,123
-胡扯！免稅的嗎？ -免稅的
- Bullshit. Tax-free? - Tax-free.

469
00:36:17,125 --> 00:36:19,124
國稅局一毛錢也拿不走
IRS can't touch one cent.

470
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:22,223
你是那個謀殺妻子的銀行家嗎？
You're that smart banker that killed his wife.

471
00:36:22,224 --> 00:36:25,824
我為何要相信你？
Why should I believe you? So I can end up in here with you?

472
00:36:25,826 --> 00:36:28,825
這是合法的，你可以去問國稅局，他們會給你同樣的回答
It's legal. Ask the IRS. They'll say the same thing.

473
00:36:28,826 --> 00:36:32,826
我知道即使我不告訴你，你也能查到的
I feel stupid telling you this. I'm sure you would have investigated.

474
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:37,025
我不需要你來教我怎麼做
I don't need you to tell me where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

475
00:36:37,026 --> 00:36:40,626
當然，但你需要有人幫你逃稅
Of course not. But you do need someone to set it up for you.

476
00:36:40,627 --> 00:36:42,326
你需要請一個律師
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

477
00:36:42,327 --> 00:36:44,626
那些華盛頓的混蛋？
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

478
00:36:45,127 --> 00:36:48,726
我想我能幫你，那你就能省點錢
I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money.

479
00:36:48,727 --> 00:36:51,026
我幫你填好文件
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

480
00:36:51,027 --> 00:36:52,826
幾乎是免費的
...nearly free of charge.

481
00:36:54,028 --> 00:36:57,328
我只要求給每個同事三瓶啤酒
I'd only ask three beers apiece for each of my coworkers.

482
00:36:58,329 --> 00:36:59,828
同事？你真的發達了
"Coworkers." That's rich!

483
00:37:00,728 --> 00:37:03,427
一個戶外工作的人能有啤酒喝的話
A man working outdoors feels more like a man...

484
00:37:03,428 --> 00:37:06,828
……會感覺更像一個男人，那是我的意見……
...if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion...

485
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,329
長官
...sir.

486
00:37:12,229 --> 00:37:14,428
你們在看什麼？
What are you jimmies staring at?

487
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:16,029
繼續幹活
Let's go! Work!

488
00:37:25,531 --> 00:37:27,630
就這樣
And that's how it came to pass...

489
00:37:27,632 --> 00:37:30,531
在完工前的第二天
... that on the second-to-last day of the job...

490
00:37:30,532 --> 00:37:35,031
在49年的春天堙A一群在工廠上面裝修的罪犯
... the convict crew that tarred the factory roof in the spring of '49...

491
00:37:35,332 --> 00:37:38,631
早上十點坐在屋頂上
... wound up sitting in a row at 10:00 in the morning...

492
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:44,331
享受著清涼的啤酒和肖申克最嚴密的保護
... drinking icy-cold beer, courtesy of the hardest screw...

493
00:37:44,333 --> 00:37:47,732
這種事在肖申克從沒有發生
... that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

494
00:37:47,733 --> 00:37:50,232
趁涼喝，女士們。
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

495
00:37:51,334 --> 00:37:55,833
他還裝作很大度似的走來走去
The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous.

496
00:37:57,034 --> 00:38:01,433
我們坐著喝著啤酒，陽光灑在肩頭，覺得是個自由人
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders and felt like free men.

497
00:38:01,834 --> 00:38:05,533
感覺就像在裝修自己家的屋項
We could have been tarring the roof of one of our own houses.

498
00:38:05,534 --> 00:38:08,333
我們就像造物主
We were the lords of all creation.

499
00:38:08,936 --> 00:38:10,435
安迪看起來
As for Andy...

500
00:38:10,735 --> 00:38:13,534
也有點不同了
... he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

501
00:38:13,535 --> 00:38:16,034
他臉上露出奇怪的笑容
... a strange little smile on his face...

502
00:38:16,336 --> 00:38:18,535
望著我們喝他的啤酒
... watching us drink his beer.

503
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:27,936
要來點嗎？
Want a cold one?

504
00:38:28,637 --> 00:38:31,536
不，謝謝，我戒酒了
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

505
00:38:35,538 --> 00:38:38,638
如果他不和獄警打交道
You could argue he done it to curry favor with the guards.

506
00:38:39,338 --> 00:38:43,138
或許就不能和我們交上朋友
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

507
00:38:43,838 --> 00:38:45,137
我？
Me?

508
00:38:45,139 --> 00:38:47,938
我覺得他這樣做只是為了在此感到自由
I think he did it just to feel normal again...

509
00:38:48,339 --> 00:38:50,638
哪怕只是一小會兒
... if only for a short while.

510
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:54,338
將軍
IKing me.

511
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,038
象棋，這是一個王者的遊戲，什麼？
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings. - What?

512
00:38:59,039 --> 00:39:00,738
文明，戰略
Civilized. Strategic.

513
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,440
我一點都沒察覺，我討厭這樣
And a total fucking mystery. I hate it.

514
00:39:04,740 --> 00:39:06,439
改天我教教你吧
Let me teach you someday.

515
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,039
好的
Sure.

516
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:11,440
或許你我可合作
We could get a board together.

517
00:39:11,441 --> 00:39:14,741
你找對人了，我能弄到很多東西
You're talking to the right man. I can get things, right?

518
00:39:14,742 --> 00:39:18,742
我們可以合作做買賣，我來雕刻
We might do business on a board, and I'll carve the pieces myself.

519
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:22,242
一面是石膏像，另一面是肥皂石，你覺得怎樣？
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone. What do you think?

520
00:39:22,843 --> 00:39:24,441
這需要很多時間
I think it'll take years.

521
00:39:24,442 --> 00:39:27,141
時間不是問題，只是沒有石頭
Years I got. What I don't have are the rocks.

522
00:39:27,143 --> 00:39:29,342
操場堿B到的都是小石頭
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

523
00:39:29,343 --> 00:39:31,142
大多是鵝卵石
Pebbles, mostly.

524
00:39:35,544 --> 00:39:38,343
安迪，我們是朋友，對嗎？
We're getting to be kind of friends, aren't we?

525
00:39:39,144 --> 00:39:40,743
我想是的
Yeah, I guess.

526
00:39:41,344 --> 00:39:42,943
我能問你個問題嗎？
Can I ask you something?

527
00:39:44,444 --> 00:39:45,843
你為何要殺你妻子？
Why'd you do it?

528
00:39:47,045 --> 00:39:48,843
我是清白的，瑞德
I'm innocent, Red.

529
00:39:48,844 --> 00:39:50,843
就像這獄中其他人一樣
Just like everybody else here.

530
00:39:55,245 --> 00:39:56,744
你怎會進來的？
What are you in for?

531
00:39:59,446 --> 00:40:01,845
和你一樣，是謀殺
Murder. Same as you.

532
00:40:01,846 --> 00:40:03,045
清白的？
Innocent?

533
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:08,145
肖申克監獄堸艉@有罪的一個
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

534
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:09,151
金絲雀在哪堙H
Where's the canary?

535
00:41:09,152 --> 00:41:10,651
你怎麼知道的？
How did you know?

536
00:41:10,652 --> 00:41:13,151
-我怎麼知道？ -原來你不知道
- How did I know what? - So you don't know.

537
00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:14,352
來
Come.

538
00:41:16,853 --> 00:41:18,952
金絲雀就在那
This is where the canary is.

539
00:41:21,554 --> 00:41:24,954
在我家聽到女人唱歌很驚訝是嗎？
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing in my house, eh?

540
00:41:28,454 --> 00:41:29,853
那確實令我……
That's quite a...

541
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:32,454
很驚訝
... surprise.

542
00:41:36,755 --> 00:41:38,154
等等
Wait, wait.

543
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:40,154
她出場了
Here she comes.

544
00:41:40,455 --> 00:41:43,554
我最愛看她擺弄頭髮那場戲
I like this part when she does that shit with her hair.

545
00:41:43,555 --> 00:41:46,454
我知道，這個月已經看了三遍了
I know. I've seen it three times this month.

546
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:48,355
吉達，你好嗎？
Gilda, are you decent?

547
00:41:49,356 --> 00:41:50,455
我？
Me?

548
00:41:53,156 --> 00:41:54,955
天啊，我喜歡這場戲
God, I love it.

549
00:42:00,157 --> 00:42:03,157
我明白你什麼都弄得到
I understand you're a man that knows how to get things.

550
00:42:04,157 --> 00:42:08,057
是的，要什麼有什麼，你要什麼？
I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. What do you want?

551
00:42:08,058 --> 00:42:10,257
-麗塔·海華絲 -什麼？
- Rita Hayworth. - What?

552
00:42:10,758 --> 00:42:12,157
你能找到她嗎？
Can you get her?

553
00:42:13,558 --> 00:42:16,958
你就是強尼嗎，久聞大名了
So this is Johnny Farrel. I've heard a lot about you.

554
00:42:18,159 --> 00:42:20,658
-要幾個星期的時間 -幾個星期？
- Take a few weeks. - Weeks?

555
00:42:20,659 --> 00:42:25,058
很抱歉，現在她又沒有坐在我的大腿上。
I don't have her stuffed down the front of my pants right now, sorry to say.

556
00:42:25,659 --> 00:42:27,158
但我能找到的
But I'll get her.

557
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,459
放鬆些
Relax.

558
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:31,659
謝謝
Thanks.

559
00:42:52,262 --> 00:42:54,261
-滾出去！ -我要換帶子了
- Get out! - I got to change reels!

560
00:42:54,262 --> 00:42:56,261
我說了，滾出去
I said fuck off!

561
00:43:02,363 --> 00:43:03,762
你打算大叫嗎？
Ain't you going to scream?

562
00:43:05,164 --> 00:43:06,963
讓我們做個了結吧
Let's get this over with.

563
00:43:12,064 --> 00:43:14,063
他打爆了我的鼻子
He broke my fucking nose!

564
00:43:23,365 --> 00:43:24,664
現在
Now...

565
00:43:25,065 --> 00:43:27,264
我要拉開拉鏈
...I'm going to open my fly...

566
00:43:27,565 --> 00:43:30,264
我給你什麼吃你就吃下什麼
...and you'll swallow what I give you to swallow.

567
00:43:31,466 --> 00:43:34,265
然後再吃羅斯的，你打爆了他的鼻子
Then you'll swallow Rooster's. You broke his nose.

568
00:43:34,266 --> 00:43:36,565
他該得到點補償
He ought to have something to show for it.

569
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:38,665
我會咬斷任何放進我嘴堛漯F西
You put it in my mouth, you lose it.

570
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:41,266
不，你還沒明白
No, you don't understand.

571
00:43:41,567 --> 00:43:44,567
你那樣做的話我就把刀插進你的耳朵
Do that and I'll put all eight inches of this in your ear.

572
00:43:44,867 --> 00:43:48,466
好吧，但你得知道突如其來的腦部撞擊
All right, but you should know that sudden, serious brain injury...

573
00:43:48,467 --> 00:43:50,666
會令受害人劇烈反應
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

574
00:43:50,668 --> 00:43:54,168
事實上，我聽說受害者會咬緊牙關
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong...

575
00:43:54,968 --> 00:43:57,567
要用鐵棍
...they have to pry the victim's jaws open...

576
00:43:57,568 --> 00:43:58,967
才能撬開他的嘴巴
...with a crowbar.

577
00:44:01,969 --> 00:44:03,667
你怎麼知道的？
Where do you get this shit?

578
00:44:03,668 --> 00:44:05,067
從書堿搢鴘
I read it.

579
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:09,168
你不會看書？白癡？
You know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

580
00:44:10,870 --> 00:44:11,869
親愛的
Honey!

581
00:44:13,870 --> 00:44:15,569
你不應該這樣的
You shouldn't!

582
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:21,169
伯格斯沒有把任何東西放進安迪的嘴
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.

583
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:23,469
他的朋友們也沒有
And neither did his friends.

584
00:44:23,971 --> 00:44:27,771
他們只是把他揍了個半死
What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life.

585
00:44:28,471 --> 00:44:30,970
安迪在療養院媥蒝蓐鬗F一個月
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

586
00:44:31,772 --> 00:44:34,271
伯格斯則被鎖進黑房關了一周
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

587
00:44:38,372 --> 00:44:39,871
伯格斯，時間到了
Time's up, Bogs.

588
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:45,372
遵命，頭
It's your world, boss.

589
00:44:48,674 --> 00:44:51,673
回到你的囚倉，等著查房
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

590
00:44:51,674 --> 00:44:54,273
所有犯人返回囚房
All prisoners report for lock down.

591
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:10,275
什麼事？
What?

592
00:45:22,876 --> 00:45:25,375
-他要到哪堨h？ -抓住他
- Where's he going? - Grab his ankles.

593
00:45:31,277 --> 00:45:32,476
救命
Help!

594
00:45:36,178 --> 00:45:38,777
之後，有兩件事再也沒發生過了
Two things never happened again after that.

595
00:45:39,078 --> 00:45:42,178
姐妹花再也不敢惹安迪了
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again.

596
00:45:42,978 --> 00:45:45,477
而伯格斯再也沒有站起來
And Bogs would never walk again.

597
00:45:46,678 --> 00:45:50,378
他被送到一個特殊醫院去
They transferred him to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

598
00:45:50,379 --> 00:45:53,378
據我所知，他在下半生中……
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest of his days...

599
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:55,178
都只能靠飲筒來進食
... drinking his food through a straw.

600
00:45:56,179 --> 00:46:00,179
我想給安迪開個歡迎會慶祝他復原
Andy could use a nice welcome back when he gets out of the infirmary.

601
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:03,579
聽起來很不錯
Sounds good to us.

602
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,379
啤酒的事我們還欠他的情
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

603
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:09,380
他喜歡下象棋
The man likes to play chess.

604
00:46:09,881 --> 00:46:11,780
給他找點石頭吧
Let's get him some rocks.

605
00:46:44,637 --> 00:46:45,936
夥計們
Guys!

606
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:47,936
我找到一塊
I got one.

607
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,437
我找到一塊，看
I got one. Look!

608
00:46:51,338 --> 00:46:55,338
希伍德，那不是皂石，也不是石膏
Heywood, that isn't soapstone! And it ain't alabaster either.

609
00:46:55,638 --> 00:46:57,737
你們他媽的是地質學家嗎？
What are you, a fucking geologist?

610
00:46:57,738 --> 00:46:59,637
他是對的，這不是我們要找的
He's right. It ain't.

611
00:46:59,639 --> 00:47:02,538
-這到底是什麼？ -糞球
- What the hell is it then? - It's a horse apple.

612
00:47:03,539 --> 00:47:06,138
-胡扯！ -不，是馬糞
- Bullshit! - No, horseshit.

613
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:07,638
曬乾了的
Petrified.

614
00:47:16,641 --> 00:47:17,840
他媽的
Damn!

615
00:47:18,140 --> 00:47:22,140
不久，他們開始認識石頭
Despite a few hitches, the boys came through in fine style.

616
00:47:22,541 --> 00:47:24,740
當安迪在週末回來的時候
And by the weekend he was due back...

617
00:47:24,741 --> 00:47:28,441
我們已經找到足夠多的石頭讓他忙個不停
... we had enough rocks saved up to keep him busy till rapture.

618
00:47:29,103 --> 00:47:31,602
那個星期我也收到很大批貨
Also got a big shipment in that week.

619
00:47:31,903 --> 00:47:33,002
香煙
Cigarettes...

620
00:47:33,303 --> 00:47:34,502
口香糖
... chewing gum...

621
00:47:34,503 --> 00:47:36,202
威土忌
... sipping whisky...

622
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:39,802
畫著裸女的撲克牌
... playing cards with naked ladies on them. You name it.

623
00:47:39,803 --> 00:47:42,502
當然，最重要的是
And of course, the most important item:

624
00:47:44,404 --> 00:47:46,403
麗塔·海華絲
Rita Hayworth herself.

625
00:48:09,201 --> 00:48:12,034
「歡迎歸來,免費享用」

626
00:48:23,507 --> 00:48:26,006
注意，要查房了
Heads up. They're tossing cells.

627
00:48:26,008 --> 00:48:28,707
注意，要查房了
Heads up. They're tossing cells!

628
00:48:29,021 --> 00:48:30,545
119房
119.

629
00:48:32,925 --> 00:48:33,949
123房
123.

630
00:48:45,810 --> 00:48:46,609
站起來
On your feet.

631
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,709
面向牆站好
Face the wall.

632
00:49:24,914 --> 00:49:26,813
轉過身面向典獄長
Turn around and face the warden.

633
00:49:33,415 --> 00:49:35,414
很高興看見你在看這本書
Pleased to see you reading this.

634
00:49:36,815 --> 00:49:38,714
特別喜歡哪一章？
Any favorite passages?

635
00:49:39,615 --> 00:49:42,114
看到你，就知道……
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not...

636
00:49:42,115 --> 00:49:44,414
你是精神之主
...when the master of the house cometh."

637
00:49:45,516 --> 00:49:47,715
馬可福音第十三章三十五節
Mark 13:35.

638
00:49:48,416 --> 00:49:50,315
我一向都喜歡那一章
I've always liked that one.

639
00:49:51,216 --> 00:49:52,915
但我更喜歡
But I prefer...

640
00:49:53,417 --> 00:49:55,216
我是世界的光
..." I am the light of the world.

641
00:49:55,716 --> 00:49:59,215
跟隨我就不會步入黑暗，而能得到生命的光
Ye that followeth me shall have the light of life."

642
00:49:59,216 --> 00:50:01,815
約瑟福音第八章第十二節
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

643
00:50:02,117 --> 00:50:04,316
我聽說你精通數學
I hear you're good with numbers.

644
00:50:04,317 --> 00:50:05,316
不錯
How nice.

645
00:50:06,617 --> 00:50:08,516
人總得有一技之長
Man should have a skill.

646
00:50:11,017 --> 00:50:12,116
這個你怎麼解釋
Explain this.

647
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:17,218
這是紗紙，打磨石頭用的
It's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

648
00:50:17,819 --> 00:50:19,718
這是我的小嗜好
A little hobby of mine.

649
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,219
相當乾淨
It's pretty clean.

650
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:35,320
看來沒什麼古怪的
Some contraband here, but nothing to get in a twist over.

651
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:41,719
這是未經我批准的
I can't say I approve of this.

652
00:50:43,321 --> 00:50:44,820
但是……
But I suppose...

653
00:50:46,822 --> 00:50:48,821
凡事總有例外
...exceptions can be made.

654
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:00,622
鎖門！
Lock them up!

655
00:51:03,523 --> 00:51:05,022
差點忘記了
I almost forgot.

656
00:51:05,523 --> 00:51:07,622
我不能取走它的
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

657
00:51:08,423 --> 00:51:10,522
救贖之道就在其中
Salvation lies within.

658
00:51:10,524 --> 00:51:11,623
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

659
00:51:20,125 --> 00:51:22,724
查房其實只是個藉口
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

660
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:24,624
事實上
Truth is...

661
00:51:24,625 --> 00:51:27,124
諾頓是想考察一下
... Norton wanted to size Andy up.

662
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:36,808
「主的審判迅速降臨」

663
00:51:40,727 --> 00:51:43,126
我太太在教堂做的
My wife made that in church group.

664
00:51:45,726 --> 00:51:47,025
很不錯，先生
Very nice, sir.

665
00:51:48,627 --> 00:51:50,126
喜歡洗衣房的工作嗎？
You enjoy working the laundry?

666
00:51:51,728 --> 00:51:53,427
不，先生，不是特別喜歡
No, sir. Not especially.

667
00:51:53,827 --> 00:51:56,226
或許我們能做點別的……
Perhaps we can find something more...

668
00:51:56,528 --> 00:51:58,927
利用你的學識
...befitting a man of your education.

669
00:52:07,029 --> 00:52:08,528
傑克，布魯斯呢？
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

670
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:13,128
安迪，我聽到你來了
I thought I heard you out here.

671
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,329
我來跟你工作
I've been reassigned to you.

672
00:52:15,630 --> 00:52:17,929
我知道，他們跟我說了
I know, they told me.

673
00:52:18,830 --> 00:52:21,029
也是被踢傷的嗎？
Ain't that a kick in the head?

674
00:52:21,030 --> 00:52:23,529
我來帶你看看吧
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

675
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:24,729
來吧
Come on.

676
00:52:26,131 --> 00:52:28,030
就在這兒
Well, here she is.

677
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:30,030
肖申克監獄圖書館
The Shawshank Prison Library.

678
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,730
《國家地理》……
National Geographics...

679
00:52:33,632 --> 00:52:36,631
《讀者文摘》……
...Reader's Digest condensed books...

680
00:52:36,632 --> 00:52:38,231
愛情小說……
...and Louis L'Amour.

681
00:52:38,832 --> 00:52:40,631
雜誌……
Look magazine.

682
00:52:41,032 --> 00:52:43,331
園藝指南
Erle Stanley Gardners.

683
00:52:43,632 --> 00:52:47,231
每晚我推車四處走
Every evening I load up the cart and make my rounds.

684
00:52:47,232 --> 00:52:49,931
名字寫在這板上
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

685
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:53,132
很容易的工作
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

686
00:52:53,934 --> 00:52:56,833
-有問題嗎？ -你當了多久的圖書管理員
- Any questions? - How long have you been librarian?

687
00:52:58,034 --> 00:53:02,034
我1905年入獄，1912年在此工作
I come here in '05, and they made me librarian in 1912.

688
00:53:03,335 --> 00:53:05,534
你一直都有助手嗎？
And have you ever had an assistant?

689
00:53:05,835 --> 00:53:08,234
沒有，工作不是那麼忙
No. Not much to it, really.

690
00:53:08,935 --> 00:53:10,234
那為什麼現在讓我來？
Why me? Why now?

691
00:53:10,635 --> 00:53:12,134
我不知道
I don't know.

692
00:53:12,135 --> 00:53:15,135
但我很高興有個伴
But it'd be nice to have some company down here.

693
00:53:15,274 --> 00:53:16,036
德福瑞恩

694
00:53:26,437 --> 00:53:28,736
就是他
That's him. That's the one.

695
00:53:36,338 --> 00:53:37,537
我叫迪格斯
I'm Dekins.

696
00:53:37,937 --> 00:53:39,536
我想……
I was thinking...

697
00:53:40,238 --> 00:53:44,138
為兒子申請助學金
...about setting up some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

698
00:53:48,039 --> 00:53:49,438
我明白了
I see.

699
00:53:54,539 --> 00:53:57,539
坐下來談好嗎？
Why don't we have a seat and talk it over.

700
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,740
布魯斯，你有紙和筆嗎？
Do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

701
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:16,340
謝謝
Thanks.

702
00:54:17,042 --> 00:54:18,041
那麼
So...

703
00:54:19,842 --> 00:54:21,641
迪格斯先生
Mister Dekins...

704
00:54:22,441 --> 00:54:24,740
接著安迪問迪格斯
And then Andy says, " Mr. Dekins...

705
00:54:24,742 --> 00:54:27,941
你想讓你的兒子去哈佛還是耶魯？
...do you want your sons to go to Harvard or Yale?"

706
00:54:27,942 --> 00:54:29,041
他沒有這樣說
He didn't say that!

707
00:54:29,343 --> 00:54:31,842
上帝可以作證
As God as my witness!

708
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,042
迪格斯愣了一會兒
Dekins blinked for a second...

709
00:54:34,043 --> 00:54:37,143
傻笑著和安迪握手
...then he laughed and actually shook Andy's hand.

710
00:54:37,644 --> 00:54:39,843
老天！和他握手
- My ass! - Shook his hand.

711
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:43,242
我告訴你們，我感到……
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

712
00:54:43,243 --> 00:54:47,243
安迪若穿上那套衣服
All he needed was a suit and tie and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

713
00:54:47,744 --> 00:54:50,243
他就會變成德福瑞恩先生的了
...he'd have been "Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

714
00:54:50,545 --> 00:54:52,144
安迪，又交上新朋友了？
Making a few friends?

715
00:54:53,445 --> 00:54:55,344
我不認為是朋友
I wouldn't say "friends."

716
00:54:55,345 --> 00:54:59,344
我是一個能提供準確財政計劃的謀殺犯
I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning.

717
00:54:59,345 --> 00:55:01,844
只是某人不錯的僕人
It's a wonderful pet to have.

718
00:55:01,846 --> 00:55:03,645
至少可以令你離開洗衣房
Got you out of the laundry, though.

719
00:55:03,946 --> 00:55:06,045
可能不是那麼簡單的
It might do more than that.

720
00:55:06,046 --> 00:55:08,945
我打算擴大圖書館，找點新書
How about expanding the library. Get some new books.

721
00:55:08,946 --> 00:55:11,545
還是找張檯球桌吧
If you ask for something, ask for a pool table.

722
00:55:13,247 --> 00:55:16,446
你打算怎麼做，我是說
How do you expect to do that? I mean...

723
00:55:16,447 --> 00:55:19,447
怎麼得到新書，向誰請求
...get new books in here, "Mr. Dufresne, if you please."

724
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:21,946
我會向典獄長要錢
I'll ask the warden for funds.

725
00:55:22,848 --> 00:55:27,347
噢，孩子，孩子，我經歷了六個典獄長，懂得了一條
Six wardens have been through here in my tenure, and I've learned...

726
00:55:27,348 --> 00:55:29,847
一個事實，宇宙真理
...one immutable, universal truth:

727
00:55:29,848 --> 00:55:31,447
那個人還沒有生出來
Not one born whose asshole...

728
00:55:31,449 --> 00:55:36,448
你向他們提出定遭拒絕的
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than a snare drum when you ask for funds.

729
00:55:37,249 --> 00:55:40,349
-預算不夠用 -我知道
- The budget's stretched thin as it is. - I see.

730
00:55:40,449 --> 00:55:44,089
或許我寫信向參議員提出
Maybe I could write the state senate and request funds from them.

731
00:55:44,129 --> 00:55:48,129
只有三種情況能動納稅人的錢
They have only three ways to spend the taxpayers' money for prisons:

732
00:55:48,450 --> 00:55:51,009
多建圍牆、多建牢房和增加監獄
More walls, more bars, more guards.

733
00:55:51,050 --> 00:55:53,889
若你批准，我想嘗試一下，每週一封信
I'd like to try, with permission. A letter a week.

734
00:55:53,930 --> 00:55:56,649
-他們不能永不理會 -當然能夠
- They can't ignore me forever. - Sure can.

735
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,649
如果你寫著高興那就寫吧
But you write your letters if it makes you happy.

736
00:55:59,931 --> 00:56:02,530
我來替你寄出，怎樣？
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

737
00:56:04,132 --> 00:56:07,092
就這樣，安迪開始每周寫一封信
So Andy started writing a letter a week...

738
00:56:07,132 --> 00:56:08,731
就像他說得那樣
... just like he said.

739
00:56:12,932 --> 00:56:15,691
但如諾頓所說
And like Norton said...

740
00:56:15,733 --> 00:56:17,252
一直都無回覆
... Andy got no answers.

741
00:56:25,453 --> 00:56:30,332
過了四月，安迪已幫半數獄警們報稅
The following April, he did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank.

742
00:56:32,184 --> 00:56:34,153
後來，全都找他幫忙了
Year after that, he did them all...

743
00:56:34,154 --> 00:56:36,083
連典獄長納稅務都由他處理
... including the warden's.

744
00:56:37,824 --> 00:56:41,464
後來，他們安排
Year after that, they rescheduled the intramural season...

745
00:56:41,506 --> 00:56:43,905
球隊在稅季中比賽
... to coincide with tax season.

746
00:56:45,506 --> 00:56:50,185
所有的球隊都帶著報稅表
The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2s.

747
00:56:49,825 --> 00:56:51,264
所以莫爾斯比監獄……
So Moresby Prison...

748
00:56:51,306 --> 00:56:53,785
配給你一支槍，但要你自己付錢
...issued you a gun, but you paid for it.

749
00:56:53,826 --> 00:56:55,665
對，連手槍皮套也是
Right. The holster too.

750
00:56:55,706 --> 00:56:58,385
那可以減免稅款，你可把它記下來
That's tax-deductible. You can write that off.

751
00:56:58,426 --> 00:57:01,426
是的！安迪就像一個正常的會計師
Yes, sir! Andy was a regular cottage industry.

752
00:57:02,107 --> 00:57:06,626
事實上，在稅季中他如此的忙，允許有一個幫手
In fact, it got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff.

753
00:57:06,907 --> 00:57:09,586
瑞德，你可以取1040號表格來嗎？
Could you hand me a stack of 1040s?

754
00:57:09,628 --> 00:57:14,427
每年有一個月離開監獄去木工場做工
Got me out of the wood shop a month out of the year, and that was fine by me.

755
00:57:15,628 --> 00:57:18,828
同時，安迪仍舊不斷的寫信
And still, he kept sending those letters.

756
00:57:25,630 --> 00:57:26,629
安迪、瑞德，布魯斯出事了
It's Brooks.

757
00:57:27,709 --> 00:57:29,228
看著門
Watch the door.

758
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:30,829
冷靜點，布魯斯
Please, Brooks.

759
00:57:31,109 --> 00:57:32,908
千萬別衝動，放下來！
- Calm the fuck down. - Stay back!

760
00:57:33,310 --> 00:57:35,909
-放下來，該死！ -發生什麼事？
- Stay back, goddamn it! - What's going on?

761
00:57:36,230 --> 00:57:38,869
他突然掏出刀來
One second he's fine, then out come the knives.

762
00:57:38,911 --> 00:57:40,710
有事慢慢商量好嗎？
We can talk about this, right?

763
00:57:41,031 --> 00:57:44,711
沒商量餘地的，我要割斷他的喉嚨
There's nothing to talk about. I'll cut his fucking throat.

764
00:57:45,031 --> 00:57:46,870
他有什麼對不起你？
What's he done to you?

765
00:57:46,912 --> 00:57:48,631
去問獄警吧
It's what they done!

766
00:57:49,111 --> 00:57:50,430
我別無選擇
I got no choice.

767
00:57:50,832 --> 00:57:53,271
我們都知道，你不會傷害海伍德的
You won't hurt Heywood. We all know that.

768
00:57:53,312 --> 00:57:55,991
-對嗎，海伍德？ -是的
- Right, Heywood? - Sure.

769
00:57:56,032 --> 00:57:59,592
他是你的朋友，布魯斯是講道理的
He's a friend of yours, and Brooks is a reasonable man.

770
00:57:59,633 --> 00:58:00,712
對嗎？
Right, guys?

771
00:58:01,713 --> 00:58:04,232
那麼把刀放下，看著我
So put the knife down. Look at me.

772
00:58:04,513 --> 00:58:06,712
把刀放下
Put the knife down.

773
00:58:08,633 --> 00:58:10,712
看看他的脖子
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

774
00:58:11,514 --> 00:58:13,833
看看他的脖子，他在流血
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

775
00:58:14,714 --> 00:58:16,393
這是唯一
It's the only way...

776
00:58:16,434 --> 00:58:18,433
使我留在這堛瑪鴘k
...they'd let me stay.

777
00:58:18,714 --> 00:58:21,273
你瘋了，你不會這樣做的
This is crazy. You don't want to do this.

778
00:58:21,314 --> 00:58:23,433
放下，放下刀
Put it, put it down.

779
00:58:32,116 --> 00:58:33,575
放鬆
Take it easy.

780
00:58:34,316 --> 00:58:35,915
一切都會好的
You'll be all right.

781
00:58:36,916 --> 00:58:38,675
他？那麼我呢？
Him? What about me?

782
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:41,275
這個愚蠢的瘋子差點割斷我的喉嚨
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

783
00:58:41,316 --> 00:58:43,395
你就連刮鬍子也比這刮得厲害
You've had worse from shaving.

784
00:58:43,437 --> 00:58:45,676
究竟怎麼會這樣？
What did you do to set him off?

785
00:58:45,717 --> 00:58:48,036
沒什麼，我只是進來和他道別
Nothing. I come in here to say farewell.

786
00:58:48,638 --> 00:58:51,237
難到你沒聽說？他獲得假釋
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

787
00:58:53,637 --> 00:58:56,597
我就是不明白，發生什麼了
I just don't understand what happened in there.

788
00:58:56,638 --> 00:58:59,598
老傢伙瘋了
Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.

789
00:58:59,638 --> 00:59:01,677
夠了
That's enough out of you.

790
00:59:01,718 --> 00:59:04,437
-我聽說你嚇得尿流 -去你媽的
- Heard he had you shitting your pants. - Fuck you.

791
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:05,918
不要說了！
IKnock it off.

792
00:59:06,839 --> 00:59:08,318
布魯斯不是瘋了
Brooks ain't no bug.

793
00:59:12,120 --> 00:59:13,919
他只是被體制化了
He's just institutionalized.

794
00:59:15,320 --> 00:59:17,399
體制化？什麼東西？
"Institutionalized," my ass.

795
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:21,440
他在此已有五十年了，海伍德，五十年！
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood, 50 years!

796
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:23,480
這是他唯一認識的地方
This is all he knows.

797
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,999
在這兒，他是個重要的人
In here, he's an important man...

798
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,120
一個有教養的人
...an educated man.

799
00:59:27,921 --> 00:59:29,920
在外面，他什麼都不是
Outside, he's nothing.

800
00:59:30,721 --> 00:59:32,400
只是一個假釋出來的囚犯
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

801
00:59:33,442 --> 00:59:37,442
申請張借書證都有困難
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

802
00:59:37,722 --> 00:59:39,441
你明白我說的話嗎？
You know what I'm trying to say?

803
00:59:39,722 --> 00:59:42,641
瑞德，我相信你說是屁話
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

804
00:59:43,922 --> 00:59:46,121
怎麼想隨你吧
You believe whatever you want.

805
00:59:46,723 --> 00:59:49,122
我告訴你，這些圍牆很有趣的
But I tell you these walls are funny.

806
00:59:50,724 --> 00:59:52,443
開始，你恨它們
First you hate them.

807
00:59:54,244 --> 00:59:56,123
接著，你適應了它們
Then you get used to them.

808
00:59:58,124 --> 01:00:00,123
時間久了
Enough time passes...

809
01:00:00,724 --> 01:00:02,723
你開始離不開它們
...you get so you depend on them.

810
01:00:03,724 --> 01:00:06,083
那就是被體制化了
That's "institutionalized."

811
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,604
Shit.

812
01:00:07,644 --> 01:00:10,443
-我永遠不會那樣的 -對嗎？
- I could never get like that. - Oh, yeah?

813
01:00:11,326 --> 01:00:14,005
因為你沒布魯斯那樣長時間在此
Wait till you've been here as long as Brooks.

814
01:00:14,045 --> 01:00:15,644
太對了
Goddamn right.

815
01:00:18,246 --> 01:00:20,125
他們把你送到這堥茈肮
They send you here for life...

816
01:00:20,846 --> 01:00:23,125
這就是他們確實想要做的
...that's exactly what they take.

817
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:26,805
無論怎樣已經部分達到了
Part that counts, anyway.

818
01:00:34,947 --> 01:00:37,846
我不能再照顧你了，傑克
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

819
01:00:39,028 --> 01:00:40,747
你走吧
You go on now.

820
01:00:41,948 --> 01:00:43,427
你自由了
You're free.

821
01:00:44,749 --> 01:00:46,348
你自由了
You're free.

822
01:01:05,351 --> 01:01:07,030
布魯斯，祝你好運
Good luck, Brooksie.

823
01:01:44,954 --> 01:01:46,433
大家好
Dear fellas:

824
01:01:46,755 --> 01:01:50,755
外面的改變令我難以想像
I can't believe how fast things move on the outside.

825
01:01:52,234 --> 01:01:54,953
老頭，找死啊？
Watch it, old-timer! Want to get killed?

826
01:01:56,155 --> 01:01:59,635
我童年時只見過一次汽車
I saw an automobile once when I was a kid...

827
01:02:00,355 --> 01:02:02,754
但現在到處都是
... but now they're everywhere.

828
01:02:06,436 --> 01:02:10,755
世界在一片巨大的忙碌之中
The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry.

829
01:02:26,558 --> 01:02:30,238
假釋委員會給我安排了中途宿舍
The parole board got me into this halfway house...

830
01:02:30,638 --> 01:02:32,397
叫做「釀酒人」
... called "The Brewer"...

831
01:02:32,438 --> 01:02:33,797
和一份工作
... and a job...

832
01:02:33,839 --> 01:02:36,839
在一家雜貨店堨]裝食物
... bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

833
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:40,918
雖然很辛苦，但我很努力工作
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

834
01:02:40,959 --> 01:02:43,358
我的手經常感到酸痛
... but my hands hurt most of the time.

835
01:02:43,640 --> 01:02:45,799
記得用兩層袋
Make sure your man double-bags.

836
01:02:45,840 --> 01:02:47,839
上次幾乎穿底了
Last time, the bottom near came out.

837
01:02:48,561 --> 01:02:51,601
聽到那女士說的嗎？
Make sure you double-bag like the lady says. Understand?

838
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:53,200
是的，先生
Yes, sir. Surely will.

839
01:02:53,240 --> 01:02:56,760
我想那店主不太喜歡我
I don't think the store manager likes me very much.

840
01:02:59,761 --> 01:03:04,040
有時工作完後，我到公園堨h餵那些鴿子
Sometimes after work, I go to the park and feed the birds.

841
01:03:04,562 --> 01:03:05,961
我一直希望
I keep thinking...

842
01:03:06,241 --> 01:03:09,561
傑克會飛來和我打招呼
... Jake might just show up and say hello.

843
01:03:10,162 --> 01:03:12,161
但它從未來過
But he never does.

844
01:03:13,363 --> 01:03:18,242
我希望，不管在哪，它都過的很好，又交到新朋友
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends.

845
01:03:21,843 --> 01:03:24,562
晚上我不能入睡
I have trouble sleeping at night.

846
01:03:24,844 --> 01:03:28,164
經常作惡夢，身體像一直往下掉
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

847
01:03:28,444 --> 01:03:30,803
醒來時感到恐懼
I wake up scared.

848
01:03:30,844 --> 01:03:34,963
要想一會兒才知道自己在哪兒
Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am.

849
01:03:36,565 --> 01:03:41,564
也許我該用槍打劫，讓他們好送我回家
Maybe I should get a gun and rob the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

850
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:46,165
我可以打死那個店主，當作額外補助
I could shoot the manager while I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

851
01:03:47,846 --> 01:03:51,846
但我已經太老了，再也幹不了這種蠢事
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore.

852
01:03:52,046 --> 01:03:53,925
我不喜歡這地方
I don't like it here.

853
01:03:53,967 --> 01:03:57,967
它令我感到害怕，我決定……
I'm tired of being afraid all the time. I've decided...

854
01:03:58,846 --> 01:04:00,445
離開
... not to stay.

855
01:04:11,448 --> 01:04:14,127
我懷疑他們會爭論
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

856
01:04:14,168 --> 01:04:17,648
但不是為我這個老壞蛋
... not for an old crook like me.

857
01:05:04,649 --> 01:05:08,517
「老布來此一遊」

858
01:05:19,975 --> 01:05:24,254
我懷疑他們會爭論，但不是為我這種老壞蛋
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss, not for an old crook like me.

859
01:05:25,255 --> 01:05:29,215
另外，跟海伍德說，上次的事很對不起，別放在心上
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

860
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:31,654
不再有痛苦的感覺了，布魯斯
No hard feelings. Brooks."

861
01:05:42,056 --> 01:05:44,055
他應該死在這兒
He should have died in here.

862
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:50,977
你該死的做了什麼？
What the fuck have you done?

863
01:05:51,257 --> 01:05:53,856
一團糟，我來告訴你
It's a goddamn mess, I'll tell you that.

864
01:05:59,458 --> 01:06:03,178
-這些都是什麼？ -你告訴我，全都寄給你的
- What's all this? - You tell me. They're addressed to you.

865
01:06:04,459 --> 01:06:05,778
拿著
Take it.

866
01:06:14,260 --> 01:06:15,779
親愛的德弗瑞恩先生
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

867
01:06:16,980 --> 01:06:19,019
應你的來信請求，州政府撥給……
In response to your inquiries...

868
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:23,389
你的圖書館計劃經費
...the state has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project."

869
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:26,139
這是200元
This is $ 200.

870
01:06:26,181 --> 01:06:30,131
而州立圖書館
"In addition, the library district has generously responded...

871
01:06:30,374 --> 01:06:32,933
捐出舊書和日常用品
...with a donation of used books and sundries.

872
01:06:33,143 --> 01:06:37,271
這些應是你所需要的，而此事亦告一段落
We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed.

873
01:06:37,481 --> 01:06:39,277
懇請閣下勿再來信
Please stop sending us letters."

874
01:06:39,515 --> 01:06:42,178
典獄長回來前要清理好
Clear all this out before the warden gets back.

875
01:06:42,419 --> 01:06:43,579
知道
Yes, sir.

876
01:06:47,858 --> 01:06:49,018
安迪，真不錯
Good for you, Andy.

877
01:06:51,997 --> 01:06:53,121
哦！
Wow!

878
01:06:54,333 --> 01:06:56,265
只用了六年時間
It only took six years.

879
01:06:57,836 --> 01:07:00,565
由現在起，我每星期寫兩封信
From now on, I'll write two letters a week instead of one.

880
01:07:00,773 --> 01:07:04,106
你真的很瘋狂，把這兒清理乾淨
I believe you're crazy enough. Get this stuff out...

881
01:07:04,376 --> 01:07:05,205
照他說的辦
...like he said.

882
01:07:05,411 --> 01:07:06,810
我去廁所
I've got to pinch a loaf.

883
01:07:07,013 --> 01:07:08,478
回來時
When I come back...

884
01:07:08,681 --> 01:07:10,444
不想見到這些書
...this is all gone, all right?

885
01:07:59,205 --> 01:08:00,602
安迪，聽到了嗎？
Do you hear that?

886
01:09:09,346 --> 01:09:10,506
德弗瑞恩！
Dufresne!

887
01:09:13,049 --> 01:09:14,573
安迪，讓我出去
Andy, let me out!

888
01:09:17,635 --> 01:09:18,499
安迪

889
01:09:21,459 --> 01:09:26,396
我到今天也沒不明白，這兩個意大利女人在唱著什麼
I have no idea to this day what those two Italian ladies were singing about.

890
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:28,928
事實上，我也不想去明白
Truth is, I don't want to know.

891
01:09:29,134 --> 01:09:31,624
有些東西不說更好
Some things are best left unsaid.

892
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,938
我想那是，如此的美
I like to think it was something so beautiful...

893
01:09:38,144 --> 01:09:40,272
無法用語言來形容
... it can't be expressed in words...

894
01:09:40,483 --> 01:09:43,381
美得讓你心痛
... and makes your heart ache because of it.

895
01:09:45,051 --> 01:09:47,541
我告訴你，那聲音飛翔
I tell you, those voices soared...

896
01:09:47,823 --> 01:09:52,122
比在這個灰暗地方的任何一個人夢想的都要高遠
... higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream.

897
01:09:52,329 --> 01:09:55,695
像一隻美麗的小鳥，飛進了我們這灰色的鳥籠
It was like a beautiful bird flapped into our drab cage...

898
01:09:55,899 --> 01:09:58,662
讓這些圍牆消失了
... and made those walls dissolve away.

899
01:09:59,101 --> 01:10:01,296
在那一刻
And for the briefest of moments...

900
01:10:01,503 --> 01:10:04,495
每個在肖申克的落伍者，感到了的自由
... every last man at Shawshank felt free.

901
01:10:07,076 --> 01:10:09,739
但那令典獄長極度憤怒
It pissed the warden off something awful.

902
01:10:11,048 --> 01:10:12,035
開門
Open the door.

903
01:10:14,951 --> 01:10:16,713
開門！
Open it up!

904
01:10:18,022 --> 01:10:20,749
德弗瑞恩，開門
Dufresne, open this door!

905
01:10:22,094 --> 01:10:23,286
把它關掉！
Turn that off!

906
01:10:30,375 --> 01:10:32,624
我警告你，德弗瑞恩！把它關掉
I am warning you. Turn that off!

907
01:10:46,236 --> 01:10:47,235
德弗瑞恩

908
01:10:50,668 --> 01:10:52,158
你落到我手堣F
You're mine now.

909
01:10:59,279 --> 01:11:02,477
安迪被關禁閉兩周
Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt.

910
01:11:02,577 --> 01:11:04,135
站起來
On your feet.

911
01:11:05,982 --> 01:11:07,648
-看看誰回來了 -大藝術家！
- Hey, look who's here. - Maestro!

912
01:11:09,982 --> 01:11:13,611
你就不能放些好聽的嗎，嗯？比如漢克.威廉姆斯！
You couldn't play something good, huh? Like Hank Williams?

913
01:11:13,822 --> 01:11:16,586
還沒來得及接受點播，他們就破門進來了
They broke the door down before I could take requests.

914
01:11:16,702 --> 01:11:19,796
-被關了兩周，值得嗎？ -那是我最好的時光
- Was it worth two weeks? - Easiest time I ever did.

915
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:24,566
沒有被關小號容易過的事，那個地方一個星期就像一年
- No such thing as easy time in the hole. - A week in the hole is like a year.

916
01:11:24,626 --> 01:11:27,891
對，我有莫扎特先生陪我
- Damn straight. - I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

917
01:11:27,986 --> 01:11:30,921
他們讓你帶留聲機到那兒？
So they let you tote that record player down there, huh?

918
01:11:33,870 --> 01:11:35,201
它就在這兒
It was in here.

919
01:11:35,982 --> 01:11:37,176
在這兒
In here.

920
01:11:38,254 --> 01:11:40,313
這就是音樂的魅力，他們……
That's the beauty of music. They...

921
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:42,760
不能把它從你這兒奪走
...can't get that from you.

922
01:11:46,094 --> 01:11:48,426
你們從沒此感覺嗎？
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

923
01:11:50,094 --> 01:11:53,188
我年輕時曾學過吹口琴
Well, I played a mean harmonica as a younger man.

924
01:11:54,094 --> 01:11:55,755
可是，現在已經失去興趣了
Lost interest in it, though.

925
01:11:55,918 --> 01:11:57,476
因為在這堥S有任何意義
Didn't make much sense in here.

926
01:11:57,774 --> 01:11:59,742
這堣~是它最有意義的地方
Here's where it makes the most sense.

927
01:12:00,205 --> 01:12:02,230
你需要它就不會忘記它
You need it so you don't forget.

928
01:12:02,734 --> 01:12:03,894
忘記？
Forget?

929
01:12:04,238 --> 01:12:07,298
忘記有一些
Forget that there are...

930
01:12:07,406 --> 01:12:08,805
地方
...places...

931
01:12:10,762 --> 01:12:14,562
在這個世界上，不是用石頭圍成
...in the world that aren't made out of stone.

932
01:12:15,592 --> 01:12:17,059
有些東西……
There's something...

933
01:12:17,618 --> 01:12:18,983
在內心……
...inside...

934
01:12:19,218 --> 01:12:21,152
不能到達……
...that they can't get to...

935
01:12:21,298 --> 01:12:22,629
……不能觸摸
...that they can't touch.

936
01:12:23,122 --> 01:12:24,521
屬於你
That's yours.

937
01:12:25,970 --> 01:12:27,528
你在說什麼？
What are you talking about?

938
01:12:28,773 --> 01:12:29,967
希望
Hope.

939
01:12:30,981 --> 01:12:32,278
希望
Hope.

940
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:36,084
我告訴你，我的朋友
Let me tell you something, my friend.

941
01:12:36,805 --> 01:12:39,069
希望是很危險的東西
Hope is a dangerous thing.

942
01:12:40,617 --> 01:12:43,313
希望會讓人瘋狂
Hope can drive a man insane.

943
01:12:43,688 --> 01:12:45,781
它在這兒沒用
It's got no use on the inside.

944
01:12:45,928 --> 01:12:48,089
你最好習慣這想法
You'd better get used to that idea.

945
01:12:50,439 --> 01:12:51,906
就像布魯斯？
Like Brooks did?

946
01:13:17,387 --> 01:13:18,354
坐下
Sit down.

947
01:13:23,467 --> 01:13:26,732
你因終身監禁在此三十年
Says here that you've served 30 years of a life sentence.

948
01:13:28,198 --> 01:13:30,223
覺得自己被改造了嗎？
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

949
01:13:30,374 --> 01:13:31,568
是的，先生
Oh, yes, sir.

950
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:34,072
毫無疑問
Without a doubt.

951
01:13:35,474 --> 01:13:37,840
老實說我己改過
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

952
01:13:39,699 --> 01:13:41,599
我已不會危害社會
No danger to society here.

953
01:13:42,367 --> 01:13:43,857
上帝可以作證
God's honest truth.

954
01:13:46,303 --> 01:13:48,362
真的改變了
Absolutely rehabilitated.

955
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:54,362
「不合格」

956
01:13:58,545 --> 01:13:59,842
三十年
Thirty years.

957
01:14:01,849 --> 01:14:03,714
當你這樣說時
Jesus, when you say it like that...

958
01:14:04,504 --> 01:14:06,233
想過是怎樣過的嗎？
You wonder where it went.

959
01:14:08,569 --> 01:14:10,662
我在想十年是怎樣過去的
I wonder where 10 years went.

960
01:14:15,416 --> 01:14:16,383
這兒
Here.

961
01:14:17,523 --> 01:14:20,185
這是慶祝你假釋被拒絕的禮物
A little parole rejection present.

962
01:14:21,467 --> 01:14:23,094
打來看看吧
Go ahead and open it.

963
01:14:24,270 --> 01:14:26,238
跟你的競爭對手買的
Went through one of your competitors.

964
01:14:26,506 --> 01:14:29,566
別介意，我想讓它給你一個驚喜
I hope you don't mind. I wanted it to be a surprise.

965
01:14:39,685 --> 01:14:41,118
它真漂亮
It's very pretty.

966
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,016
謝謝你
Thank you.

967
01:14:46,659 --> 01:14:48,092
你會用它來吹奏嗎？
You going to play it?

968
01:14:52,698 --> 01:14:53,892
不
No.

969
01:14:57,570 --> 01:14:58,935
不會是現在
Not right now.

970
01:15:16,657 --> 01:15:17,681
關上！
Roll in!

971
01:15:33,657 --> 01:15:35,681
「這個新女孩給你紀念十週年，安迪」

972
01:15:53,961 --> 01:15:55,121
熄燈
Lights out!

973
01:16:29,796 --> 01:16:31,922
安迪說到做到……
Andy was as good as his word.

974
01:16:32,298 --> 01:16:35,063
他每周寫兩封信
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

975
01:16:37,136 --> 01:16:41,233
1959年，州議員最後終於面對現實
In 1959, the state senate finally clued in to the fact...

976
01:16:41,475 --> 01:16:44,603
那200元的支票起不了作用
... they couldn't buy him off with just a $ 200 check.

977
01:16:44,810 --> 01:16:49,110
最後通過每年撥款500元
Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of $500...

978
01:16:49,314 --> 01:16:51,216
來讓他閉嘴
... just to shut him up.

979
01:16:51,417 --> 01:16:54,409
隨後安迪所說的令你感到更意外
And you'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it.

980
01:16:54,621 --> 01:16:57,555
他跟讀書會和慈善機構談至
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

981
01:16:57,756 --> 01:17:00,521
他用剩下來的錢來買書
He bought remaindered books by the pound...

982
01:17:01,028 --> 01:17:02,551
《金銀島》
Treasure Island.

983
01:17:03,096 --> 01:17:04,426
羅伯特·路易斯……
Robert Louis...

984
01:17:04,631 --> 01:17:05,654
斯蒂文森
Stevenson.

985
01:17:05,865 --> 01:17:07,230
科幻類，冒險類
Fiction, adventure.

986
01:17:09,802 --> 01:17:10,827
下一本是什麼？
What's next?

987
01:17:11,038 --> 01:17:14,097
是汽車修理
I got here Auto Repair...

988
01:17:14,841 --> 01:17:16,001
和肥皂雕刻技術
...and Soap Carving.

989
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:19,439
技術與愛好，教育性那一欄
Trade skills and hobbies. Under "Educational," behind you.

990
01:17:19,645 --> 01:17:21,511
《基督山伯爵》
Count of Monte Crisco.

991
01:17:21,981 --> 01:17:24,279
那書不值一看
That's "Cristo," you dumb shit.

992
01:17:24,835 --> 01:17:25,823
作者是亞歷山大……
By Alexandree...

993
01:17:26,303 --> 01:17:27,564
……什麼……馬
...Dum-ass.

994
01:17:28,304 --> 01:17:29,329
「草泥馬」
Dumb ass.

995
01:17:31,642 --> 01:17:32,700
「草泥馬」？
Dumb ass?

996
01:17:35,611 --> 01:17:37,579
是大仲馬。德弗瑞恩，知道那是什麼故事嗎？
Dumas. IKnow what that's about?

997
01:17:39,849 --> 01:17:41,817
講越獄的，你喜歡看的
You'd like it. It's about a prison break.

998
01:17:42,018 --> 01:17:45,920
那我覺得應該發到「教育類」，對吧？
We ought to file that under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

999
01:17:46,789 --> 01:17:50,886
我們其餘的隨時盡可能幫忙
The rest of us did our best to pitch in when and where we could.

1000
01:17:51,460 --> 01:17:53,223
到了肯尼迪遇刺那一年
By the year Kennedy was shot...

1001
01:17:53,463 --> 01:17:57,956
安迪把一個充滿松脂味的儲藏間
... Andy had transformed a storage room smelling of turpentine...

1002
01:17:58,267 --> 01:18:01,361
變成了新英格蘭州最好的的監獄圖書館
... into the best prison library in New England...

1003
01:18:02,071 --> 01:18:05,007
那埵陶怞n的漢克威廉姆斯唱片集
... complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1004
01:18:12,382 --> 01:18:14,316
那也是諾頓典獄長髮展大計的一年
That was also when Warden Norton...

1005
01:18:14,517 --> 01:18:17,453
推廣他著名的「內在改造」計劃
... instituted his famous "Inside Out" program.

1006
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:19,980
你可能從報紙上讀到過
You may remember reading about it.

1007
01:18:20,223 --> 01:18:23,317
所有的媒體都刊出他的照片
It made the papers and got his picture in Look magazine.

1008
01:18:23,526 --> 01:18:24,824
這不是放任的方式
It's no free ride...

1009
01:18:25,027 --> 01:18:28,258
……而是一種真正的進步
...but rather a genuine progressive advance...

1010
01:18:28,464 --> 01:18:30,955
……讓犯人恢復道德
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

1011
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:33,825
收容人被適當的監督
Our inmates, properly supervised...

1012
01:18:34,036 --> 01:18:36,664
使他們能在外面工作
...will be put to work outside these walls...

1013
01:18:36,874 --> 01:18:39,834
為大眾服務
...performing all manner of public service.

1014
01:18:40,110 --> 01:18:42,341
他們會懂得勞動的價值
These men can learn the value...

1015
01:18:42,546 --> 01:18:46,346
為社會服務的誠實勞動
...of an honest day's labor and provide a service to the community...

1016
01:18:46,550 --> 01:18:51,248
在最低耗支情況下，來利用納稅人的金錢
...at a bare minimum of expense to Mr. And Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

1017
01:18:51,989 --> 01:18:54,320
當然，諾頓沒有跟報界說
Of course he didn't tell the press...

1018
01:18:54,525 --> 01:18:57,982
「最低耗支」其實是相當不確切的說法
... that "bare minimum of expense" is a fairly loose term.

1019
01:18:58,295 --> 01:19:01,321
有很多辦法能瞞天過海的
There are 100 different ways to skim off the top.

1020
01:19:01,531 --> 01:19:04,022
人力，物力，你說多少就多少
Men, materials, you name it.

1021
01:19:04,567 --> 01:19:07,468
上帝，錢是這樣滾入！
And oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in!

1022
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:10,196
繼續這樣，我不用幹了
At this rate, you'll put me out of business.

1023
01:19:10,406 --> 01:19:14,843
有這些勞工，你可比這鎮上的承包商出更低價
With this pool of slave labor, you can underbid any contractor in town.

1024
01:19:15,411 --> 01:19:18,380
我們提供有用的社區勞務
We're providing a valuable community service.

1025
01:19:18,581 --> 01:19:22,245
對報界來說很動聽，但我要養家活口的
That's fine for the papers, but I've got a family to feed.

1026
01:19:24,922 --> 01:19:26,446
我們走得太遠
We go back a long way.

1027
01:19:27,758 --> 01:19:32,695
我需要這份公路的合同，如果拿不到我就完了
I need this highway contract. I don't get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1028
01:19:33,597 --> 01:19:35,393
嘗嘗我的妻子給你特製的陷餅吧
You have some of this fine pie...

1029
01:19:35,632 --> 01:19:38,964
好好考慮一下
...my missus made for you. You think about that.

1030
01:19:47,244 --> 01:19:49,940
如果我是你對此合同並不擔心
I wouldn't worry too much about this contract.

1031
01:19:50,179 --> 01:19:53,240
我已把人手派至別處
I already got my boys committed elsewhere.

1032
01:19:55,218 --> 01:19:58,277
謝謝你太太的糕餅
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1033
01:19:59,388 --> 01:20:01,548
每筆暗盤交易下
And behind every shady deal...

1034
01:20:01,892 --> 01:20:04,520
賺來的每一分錢
... behind every dollar earned...

1035
01:20:04,794 --> 01:20:07,855
都是由安迪來作記錄的
... there was Andy, keeping the books.

1036
01:20:08,264 --> 01:20:09,526
兩筆存款
Two deposits.

1037
01:20:09,766 --> 01:20:13,896
文尼國際和新格蘭，一天又過去了
Maine National and New England First. Night drops as always, sir.

1038
01:20:44,101 --> 01:20:48,434
-把我的東西拿到洗衣房 -兩套衣服要乾洗的，還有架上的袋子
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1039
01:20:48,905 --> 01:20:52,432
如果他們再把我的襯衫漿過了頭，有他們好受的
If they over-starch my shirts again, they'll hear from me.

1040
01:20:52,642 --> 01:20:53,972
我看上去怎麼樣？
How do I look?

1041
01:20:55,012 --> 01:20:57,503
-很不錯 -這是盛大的慈善晚會
- Very nice. - Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1042
01:20:57,713 --> 01:20:59,237
州長也會出席
Governor will be there.

1043
01:21:00,650 --> 01:21:02,116
你要剩下的這些嗎？
You want the rest of this?

1044
01:21:03,453 --> 01:21:05,387
烤的太難吃
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1045
01:21:06,623 --> 01:21:07,954
謝謝，長官
Thank you, sir.

1046
01:21:10,794 --> 01:21:14,025
我聽說這樣的派，他收了不少
He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1047
01:21:14,231 --> 01:21:19,066
他有你想像不到的手段，回扣、酬金..
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of. IKickbacks on his kickbacks.

1048
01:21:19,268 --> 01:21:21,634
黑錢像河一樣流過這
A river of dirty money running through here.

1049
01:21:21,838 --> 01:21:25,672
但他遲早得解釋錢是從何而來的
Sooner or later, he'll have to explain where it came from.

1050
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:27,638
這就是我牽涉其中的原因
That's where I come in.

1051
01:21:28,245 --> 01:21:30,543
我安排了一切來過濾
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1052
01:21:30,746 --> 01:21:33,579
股票、債券、市政免稅……
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1053
01:21:33,916 --> 01:21:37,444
我把錢送到外面，等它們回來的時候……
I send it out into the real world, and when it comes back...

1054
01:21:37,654 --> 01:21:40,623
-純潔得就像個處女 -像洗衣機
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh? - Cleaner.

1055
01:21:41,223 --> 01:21:44,819
到諾頓退休的時候，我已讓他成為百萬富翁了
By the time Norton retires, I'll have made him a millionaire.

1056
01:21:47,164 --> 01:21:51,498
如果被他們抓住的話，他將在自己的監獄穿上這樣的號碼服
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1057
01:21:51,767 --> 01:21:54,463
看來你對我沒有信心
I thought you had more faith in me than that.

1058
01:21:54,670 --> 01:21:57,696
我知道你很能幹，但是總會蛛絲馬跡留下
I know you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail.

1059
01:21:57,907 --> 01:22:01,308
只要有人想細查，FBI，國稅局
Now anybody gets curious, FBI, IRS...

1060
01:22:01,511 --> 01:22:02,499
不管怎樣
...whatever.

1061
01:22:02,946 --> 01:22:04,242
總會有人被牽扯
It'll lead to somebody.

1062
01:22:04,447 --> 01:22:08,316
是的，但不會是我，也不會是典獄長
Sure it is, but not to me, and certainly not to the warden.

1063
01:22:12,688 --> 01:22:13,678
那會是誰？
All right, who?

1064
01:22:13,889 --> 01:22:15,481
蘭度·史蒂文
Randall Stevens.

1065
01:22:16,026 --> 01:22:16,958
誰？
Who?

1066
01:22:17,160 --> 01:22:19,151
從不出聲的拍檔
The "silent" silent partner.

1067
01:22:19,361 --> 01:22:22,422
他是帳戶的持有者，他才有罪
He's the guilty one, the man with the bank accounts.

1068
01:22:22,632 --> 01:22:24,793
他那堿O過濾黑錢過程的起點
It's where the filtering process starts.

1069
01:22:25,000 --> 01:22:27,867
不管他們如何調查，都只會查到他
They trace anything, it'll just lead to him.

1070
01:22:28,472 --> 01:22:29,700
他是什麼人？
But who is he?

1071
01:22:29,905 --> 01:22:33,865
他是一個幻影，幽靈，是兔子哈維的第二個表弟
He's a phantom, an apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1072
01:22:34,977 --> 01:22:36,138
我憑空……
I conjured him...

1073
01:22:36,346 --> 01:22:37,710
造出他來
...out of thin air.

1074
01:22:38,514 --> 01:22:41,245
他只存在於文件中罷了
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1075
01:22:44,321 --> 01:22:46,687
你不能只這麼捏造一個人
You can't just make a person up.

1076
01:22:46,889 --> 01:22:49,983
當然可以，如果你知道我們社會系統的漏洞
Sure you can, if you know how the system works.

1077
01:22:50,494 --> 01:22:53,326
吃驚的是郵政就能幫你做到
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1078
01:22:53,663 --> 01:22:56,289
史蒂文先生有出生證明書
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1079
01:22:56,499 --> 01:22:58,626
駕駛執照和社會編號
...driver's license, Social Security.

1080
01:22:58,901 --> 01:22:59,891
你在說笑
You're shitting me.

1081
01:23:00,102 --> 01:23:03,469
他們追查帳戶的話，只是在追查
If they trace any accounts, they'll wind up chasing...

1082
01:23:03,673 --> 01:23:05,401
我幻想出來的人
...a figment of my imagination.

1083
01:23:05,608 --> 01:23:07,599
喔，該死
Well, I'll be damned!

1084
01:23:08,945 --> 01:23:10,673
我沒說過你很能幹嗎？
Did I say you were good?

1085
01:23:11,047 --> 01:23:12,673
該死，你簡直是倫勃朗
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1086
01:23:13,414 --> 01:23:15,145
有趣的是
The funny thing is...

1087
01:23:15,352 --> 01:23:19,447
……在外面，我是個誠實的人，正直得像桿直箭
...on the outside, I was an honest man, straight as an arrow.

1088
01:23:19,856 --> 01:23:22,187
變成騙子就不得不到監獄堥
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1089
01:23:31,066 --> 01:23:32,364
你擔心過嗎？
Ever bother you?

1090
01:23:33,803 --> 01:23:36,862
我沒參與，我只是處理收益
I don't run the scams. I just process the profits.

1091
01:23:37,139 --> 01:23:39,130
一條好的分界線，也許吧
A fine line, maybe...

1092
01:23:39,709 --> 01:23:41,767
不過我也建起了圖書館
...but I also built that library...

1093
01:23:41,977 --> 01:23:45,004
來幫助囚犯取得高中文憑
...and used it to help guys get their high school diploma.

1094
01:23:45,214 --> 01:23:47,445
你可知他會何會讓我做所有這些？
Why do you think he lets me do all that?

1095
01:23:47,651 --> 01:23:49,846
讓你開心，好幫他「清洗」……
IKeep you happy and doing the laundry.

1096
01:23:50,053 --> 01:23:51,520
洗的是錢而非床單
Money instead of sheets.

1097
01:23:51,888 --> 01:23:54,481
讓我工作輕鬆，那是交易
Well, I work cheap. That's the tradeoff.

1098
01:24:11,740 --> 01:24:14,369
湯姆·威廉姆斯1965年到肖申克監獄服刑
Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965...

1099
01:24:14,611 --> 01:24:16,840
因非法入室行竊，被判兩年監禁
... on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1100
01:24:17,079 --> 01:24:19,411
那是對私人的非法入侵
That's breaking and entering to you.

1101
01:24:19,682 --> 01:24:23,914
警察在佩妮家後門抓到，他在電視旁鬼鬼祟祟的
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney.

1102
01:24:24,353 --> 01:24:25,651
年輕的朋克
Young punk.

1103
01:24:25,855 --> 01:24:27,481
「搖滾」先生
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1104
01:24:27,691 --> 01:24:29,214
過於自大
... cocky as hell.

1105
01:24:29,425 --> 01:24:31,825
快點，老傢伙們，慢得跟糖漿一樣
Come on, old boys. Moving like molasses!

1106
01:24:32,062 --> 01:24:33,825
我乾著急
Making me look bad.

1107
01:24:34,030 --> 01:24:35,826
我們馬上就喜歡上他了
We liked him immediately.

1108
01:24:36,066 --> 01:24:39,797
我從後門出來，像這樣捧著電視機
I'm backing out the door and I got the TV like this.

1109
01:24:40,486 --> 01:24:43,886
一件大的老傢伙，我都看不到了，然後我聽到這個聲音
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit. Then I hear this voice.

1110
01:24:44,524 --> 01:24:46,492
別動，舉起手來！
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air."

1111
01:24:47,343 --> 01:24:51,803
我站在那堙A捧著電視機，他又說：
I was standing there, holding onto that TV. Finally the voice says:

1112
01:24:52,013 --> 01:24:55,813
「你聽到我說的嗎？」，我說，「是的，先生」
"You hear what I said, boy?" I say, " Yes, sir. I did.

1113
01:24:56,018 --> 01:24:59,475
但我掉落東西，你會告我毀壞他人財物
But if I drop this, you get me on destruction of property too."

1114
01:25:03,959 --> 01:25:06,256
你曾在卡士文服刑，是嗎？
You done some stretch in Cashman, right?

1115
01:25:06,762 --> 01:25:10,720
是的，那兒要好過得多
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time, let me tell you.

1116
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:12,933
週末有休假，工作也很有計劃
Weekend furloughs. Work programs.

1117
01:25:13,134 --> 01:25:14,192
不像這
Not like here.

1118
01:25:14,402 --> 01:25:16,836
看來你在新英格蘭都呆在車
Sounds like you done time all over.

1119
01:25:17,272 --> 01:25:19,673
我十三歲出道，哪堻ㄔh過
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1120
01:25:19,875 --> 01:25:21,826
說說看，也許我也去過那
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1121
01:25:21,827 --> 01:25:24,489
也許你應轉行了
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1122
01:25:25,931 --> 01:25:27,489
我是說
What I mean is...

1123
01:25:27,833 --> 01:25:31,269
……你不是個一流的小偷，你該試試別的
...you're not a very good thief. You should try something else.

1124
01:25:31,504 --> 01:25:34,734
是嗎？你以為你懂這個？
Yeah, what the hell you know about it, Capone?

1125
01:25:35,039 --> 01:25:36,633
你怎會進來的？
What are you in for?

1126
01:25:36,910 --> 01:25:37,898
我嗎？
Me?

1127
01:25:40,346 --> 01:25:42,007
律師坑了我
A lawyer fucked me.

1128
01:25:45,919 --> 01:25:48,888
這兒所有人都是無辜的，你不知道嗎？
Everybody's innocent in here. Don't you know that?

1129
01:25:56,795 --> 01:26:01,199
後來知道，湯姆竟然有妻子和剛出生的女兒
As it turned out, Tommy had himself a young wife and a new baby girl.

1130
01:26:01,667 --> 01:26:03,795
也許他想到她們在街上流蕩
Maybe he thought of them on the streets...

1131
01:26:04,002 --> 01:26:06,493
孩子長大卻不知道父親是誰
... or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

1132
01:26:06,805 --> 01:26:08,171
不管為什麼，總之
Whatever it was...

1133
01:26:08,506 --> 01:26:10,941
他竟努力起來了
... something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1134
01:26:14,780 --> 01:26:17,648
我想考取高校文憑
Thought I might try for my high school equivalency.

1135
01:26:17,850 --> 01:26:20,376
聽說你已經幫了很多人了
Hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1136
01:26:21,721 --> 01:26:23,950
我不會在失敗者身上浪費時間的
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1137
01:26:25,358 --> 01:26:27,849
我再也不是失敗者了
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1138
01:26:29,596 --> 01:26:31,426
-你當真？ -是
- You mean that? - Yeah.

1139
01:26:33,099 --> 01:26:34,532
你真的是認真的？
You really mean that?

1140
01:26:35,568 --> 01:26:36,932
是的，先生，絕對是真的
Yes, sir, I do.

1141
01:26:37,136 --> 01:26:39,104
好，因為我們要做就要……
Good. Because if we do this...

1142
01:26:39,305 --> 01:26:43,264
……有始有終，絕對不能半途而廢
...we do it all the way, a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1143
01:26:43,510 --> 01:26:45,306
問題是……
Thing is, see...

1144
01:26:46,578 --> 01:26:48,103
我識字不多
...I don't read so good.

1145
01:26:49,282 --> 01:26:50,373
好吧
"Well."

1146
01:26:52,385 --> 01:26:54,113
你不識字
You don't read...

1147
01:26:54,354 --> 01:26:55,877
就這樣
...so well.

1148
01:26:58,224 --> 01:26:59,713
我們就由它開始
We'll get to that.

1149
01:27:04,163 --> 01:27:06,289
就這樣，安迪開始給湯姆上課
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1150
01:27:06,498 --> 01:27:09,127
從最基礎的字母開始教
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1151
01:27:11,270 --> 01:27:13,466
湯姆學得很快
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1152
01:27:13,739 --> 01:27:16,503
從不知道自己的聰明
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1153
01:27:18,845 --> 01:27:22,280
沒過多久，安迪開始教他課程內容
Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements.

1154
01:27:22,481 --> 01:27:24,142
他很喜歡這個孩子
He really liked the kid.

1155
01:27:24,350 --> 01:27:27,911
幫一個孩子上進讓他很快樂
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shit heap.

1156
01:27:28,421 --> 01:27:30,685
但那不是唯一的原因
But that wasn't the only reason.

1157
01:27:31,390 --> 01:27:33,586
監獄堛漱擗l很緩慢
Prison time is slow time.

1158
01:27:34,060 --> 01:27:36,654
要用某些事情來消磨時間
So you do what you can to keep going.

1159
01:27:36,996 --> 01:27:39,055
有人收集郵票
Some fellas collect stamps.

1160
01:27:39,465 --> 01:27:41,932
有人收集火柴盒
Others build matchstick houses.

1161
01:27:42,534 --> 01:27:45,197
安迪建起了圖書館
Andy built a library.

1162
01:27:45,704 --> 01:27:47,639
現在他需要新的計劃
Now he needed a new project.

1163
01:27:48,506 --> 01:27:49,997
那就是湯姆
Tommy was it.

1164
01:27:50,642 --> 01:27:54,636
那和他多年來雕磨石頭的原因一樣
It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks.

1165
01:27:55,180 --> 01:27:58,412
也如同他把美女的畫像掛在牆上的原因
The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1166
01:27:59,319 --> 01:28:00,581
在監獄
In prison...

1167
01:28:00,853 --> 01:28:04,583
一個人不能讓心堛霾
... a man will do most anything to keep his mind occupied.

1168
01:28:05,358 --> 01:28:10,226
在1966年，湯姆剛要參加考試的時候
By 1966, right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...

1169
01:28:10,462 --> 01:28:12,658
可愛的瑞奎爾（Raquel）出現了
... it was lovely Raquel.

1170
01:28:29,215 --> 01:28:30,203
時間到
Time.

1171
01:28:36,255 --> 01:28:37,243
好了嗎？
Well?

1172
01:28:38,858 --> 01:28:40,984
真的是一團糟
Well, it's for shit.

1173
01:28:41,493 --> 01:28:44,327
我白花了一年時間在這狗屎上面
I wasted a whole year of my time with this bullshit.

1174
01:28:44,529 --> 01:28:46,020
也許沒有你想的那麼糟
It's probably not that bad.

1175
01:28:46,231 --> 01:28:50,463
比我想像中的還要糟，就像在考中文
I didn't get a thing right. It might as well have been in Chinese.

1176
01:28:50,670 --> 01:28:52,399
看看你得了多少分？
Let's see how the score comes out.

1177
01:28:52,604 --> 01:28:55,573
我來告訴你吧
I'll tell you how the goddamn score comes out.

1178
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:58,874
兩分
Two points, right there!

1179
01:28:59,078 --> 01:29:00,636
那就是你該死的考試
There's your goddamn score!

1180
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,577
什麼貓爬上樹，5乘以5是25
Goddamn cats crawling up trees, 5 times 5 is 25...

1181
01:29:05,517 --> 01:29:07,145
去死吧
Fuck this place!

1182
01:29:07,386 --> 01:29:08,512
他媽的
Fuck it!

1183
01:29:27,673 --> 01:29:28,935
我感覺很差
I feel bad.

1184
01:29:29,141 --> 01:29:30,336
我令他失望了
I let him down.

1185
01:29:30,542 --> 01:29:32,271
不是這樣，孩子
That's crap, kid.

1186
01:29:32,478 --> 01:29:33,809
他以你為榮
He's proud of you.

1187
01:29:34,146 --> 01:29:37,014
我跟他是老朋友，我很清楚他的性格
We're old friends, I know him as good as anybody.

1188
01:29:37,216 --> 01:29:38,774
聰明的夥伴，不是嗎？
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1189
01:29:38,984 --> 01:29:42,113
就像剛進來時一樣聰明，他以前是個銀行家
Smart as they come. He was a banker on the outside.

1190
01:29:42,320 --> 01:29:44,551
他為什麼被抓進來？
What's he in here for anyway?

1191
01:29:44,890 --> 01:29:45,858
謀殺
Murder.

1192
01:29:47,325 --> 01:29:48,689
你說什麼？
The hell, you say.

1193
01:29:50,829 --> 01:29:53,162
人不可以貌相
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1194
01:29:54,399 --> 01:29:58,496
在床上捉到妻子和一個高爾夫選手，把他們兩個一起解決了
Caught his wife in bed with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1195
01:30:06,180 --> 01:30:07,112
怎麼了?
What?

1196
01:30:08,649 --> 01:30:10,708
大約四年前
About four years ago...

1197
01:30:11,485 --> 01:30:15,182
我在湯瑪斯獄服刑
...I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1198
01:30:15,729 --> 01:30:17,025
我偷了一輛車
I stole a car.

1199
01:30:17,398 --> 01:30:19,389
這是很不應該的事
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1200
01:30:19,866 --> 01:30:22,096
在出獄前六個月
About six months left to go...

1201
01:30:22,403 --> 01:30:24,302
我有了個新同房
...I get a new cellmate in.

1202
01:30:25,004 --> 01:30:26,632
艾馬·布萊奇
Elmo Blatch.

1203
01:30:27,341 --> 01:30:28,672
一個強壯、暴躁的混蛋
Big, twitchy fucker.

1204
01:30:29,543 --> 01:30:33,034
人見人憎的那種，明白我的意思嗎？
IKind of roomie you pray you don't get. You know what I'm saying?

1205
01:30:33,247 --> 01:30:35,976
刑期是六到十二年，持械搶劫
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1206
01:30:36,249 --> 01:30:38,513
他說自己犯了不少案子
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1207
01:30:38,718 --> 01:30:43,655
難以相信，他很容易激動，你放個屁，他就暴跳如雷
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was. You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1208
01:30:44,725 --> 01:30:49,355
整天說個不停，從不閉嘴
Talked all the time too. That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1209
01:30:49,562 --> 01:30:51,190
他談他去過的地方
Places he'd been in...

1210
01:30:51,498 --> 01:30:54,556
他幹過的案子，上過的女人
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1211
01:30:54,802 --> 01:30:56,997
和他殺的人
Even people he killed.

1212
01:30:58,239 --> 01:31:01,037
那些讓他不爽的人
People who "gave him shit."

1213
01:31:01,674 --> 01:31:03,232
他是這麼說的
That's how he put it.

1214
01:31:05,846 --> 01:31:07,904
有天晚上，我開玩笑的說
So one night, like a joke...

1215
01:31:09,016 --> 01:31:12,507
我問他，艾馬，你殺了誰？
...I say to him, "Elmo, who did you kill?"

1216
01:31:12,753 --> 01:31:13,845
他說……
So he says:

1217
01:31:14,053 --> 01:31:18,012
有次我在鄉村俱樂部打工
I got me this job one time, busing tables at a country club...

1218
01:31:18,691 --> 01:31:22,593
看到來的人都非富則貴
...so I could case all these big rich pricks that come in.

1219
01:31:24,698 --> 01:31:26,689
所以我選了一個傢伙
So I pick out this guy...

1220
01:31:27,601 --> 01:31:29,159
有天晚上到他家堨h
...go in one night...

1221
01:31:29,369 --> 01:31:31,098
搶劫東西
...and do his place.

1222
01:31:32,538 --> 01:31:33,869
他醒過來
He wakes up...

1223
01:31:34,607 --> 01:31:36,370
令我很不爽
...and gives me shit.

1224
01:31:37,444 --> 01:31:39,105
所以我殺了他
So I killed him.

1225
01:31:40,881 --> 01:31:43,713
他和他的情婦
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1226
01:31:45,119 --> 01:31:47,382
那是最精彩的部分
And that's the best part.

1227
01:31:48,055 --> 01:31:50,522
她在和這個職業高爾夫球手做愛
She's fucking this prick, see...

1228
01:31:50,723 --> 01:31:53,784
但她是個有夫之婦
...this golf pro, but she's married to some other guy.

1229
01:31:54,395 --> 01:31:56,954
她丈夫是個銀行家
Some hotshot banker.

1230
01:31:58,399 --> 01:32:00,890
而他竟成了替罪羊
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1231
01:32:12,378 --> 01:32:16,247
這是我聽過的最震驚的故事
I have to say that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1232
01:32:17,517 --> 01:32:20,008
更讓我吃驚的是，你竟然相信了它
What amazes me most is you'd be taken in by it.

1233
01:32:20,753 --> 01:32:21,721
先生？
Sir?

1234
01:32:23,958 --> 01:32:27,552
很明顯威廉姆斯很喜歡你
It's obvious this fellow Williams is impressed with you.

1235
01:32:28,162 --> 01:32:32,097
他知道你的事後想讓你振作起來
He hears your tale of woe and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1236
01:32:32,297 --> 01:32:34,459
他還年輕，不怎麼明事理
He's young, not terribly bright.

1237
01:32:35,002 --> 01:32:38,437
他根本不明白這對你意味著什麼，這並不奇怪
It's not surprising he wouldn't know what a state he put you in.

1238
01:32:38,838 --> 01:32:40,396
獄長，他講的是事實
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1239
01:32:41,174 --> 01:32:45,338
就說這個，如果有布萊奇這個人的話
Let's say for the moment this Blatch does exist.

1240
01:32:45,611 --> 01:32:50,241
你認為他會跪下來，哭著說「是我做的，我坦白」
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry, " Yes, I did it. I confess.

1241
01:32:50,450 --> 01:32:53,146
方便的話，給我加個終身監禁吧
By the way, add a life term to my sentence."

1242
01:32:53,354 --> 01:32:56,151
但是湯姆的證供能讓我的案子重審
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1243
01:32:56,356 --> 01:32:58,824
前提是布萊奇在那獄中
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1244
01:32:59,058 --> 01:33:00,993
也許他現在已經獲釋了
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1245
01:33:01,195 --> 01:33:03,663
他們應該有他的住址的
They'd have his last known address.

1246
01:33:03,864 --> 01:33:05,797
這是個機會，對嗎？
It's a chance, isn't it?

1247
01:33:08,134 --> 01:33:09,864
你怎會這麼愚蠢？
How can you be so obtuse?

1248
01:33:10,803 --> 01:33:11,793
什麼？
What?

1249
01:33:13,306 --> 01:33:14,774
你說什麼？
What did you call me?

1250
01:33:14,975 --> 01:33:16,704
愚蠢，這是故意說的？
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1251
01:33:17,077 --> 01:33:18,566
你忘記你自己的身份了
You're forgetting yourself.

1252
01:33:18,912 --> 01:33:21,846
俱樂部會有他的工作記錄卡的記錄……
The country club will have his old timecards.

1253
01:33:22,047 --> 01:33:24,812
和有他名字的報稅表
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1254
01:33:25,019 --> 01:33:27,714
你要繼續幻想的話，那是你的事
If you want to indulge this fantasy, it's your business.

1255
01:33:27,921 --> 01:33:30,515
不要影響我，談話結束
Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.

1256
01:33:30,723 --> 01:33:33,317
如果我能出去的話，我不會提起這媯o生的一切
If I got out, I'd never mention what happens here.

1257
01:33:33,961 --> 01:33:36,930
我可以繼續為你洗黑錢
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering that money.

1258
01:33:38,797 --> 01:33:41,734
永遠不許和我提錢的事，你這個婊子養的
Don't ever mention money to me, you son of a bitch!

1259
01:33:41,935 --> 01:33:43,596
不許在這間辦公室
Not in this office...

1260
01:33:43,803 --> 01:33:45,238
不許在任何地方
...not anywhere. Get in here, now!

1261
01:33:45,265 --> 01:33:45,863
進來
I just wanted to put you at ease, that's all.

1262
01:33:45,972 --> 01:33:48,668
我只是想讓你放心，沒別的意恩

1263
01:33:49,308 --> 01:33:50,570
-禁閉室，一個月 -是，長官
Solitary. A month.

1264
01:33:51,578 --> 01:33:52,874
你怎麼了？
What's wrong with you?

1265
01:33:53,079 --> 01:33:54,377
把他帶出去
Get him out of here.

1266
01:33:54,580 --> 01:33:56,138
這是我出去的唯一的機會
This is my chance to get out!

1267
01:33:56,350 --> 01:33:58,146
這是我的人生！你明白嗎？
It's my life! Understand?!

1268
01:33:58,351 --> 01:34:00,410
帶他出去！帶他出去！
Get him out!

1269
01:34:02,189 --> 01:34:04,156
關禁閉一個月
A month in the hole.

1270
01:34:04,357 --> 01:34:07,053
這是我聽到過的最嚴厲的懲罰
That's the longest stretch I ever heard of.

1271
01:34:07,261 --> 01:34:08,556
這都是我的錯
It's all my fault.

1272
01:34:08,762 --> 01:34:10,354
廢話
Bullshit.

1273
01:34:11,030 --> 01:34:13,726
事情不是由你而起的，或讓他入罪
You didn't pull the trigger or convict him.

1274
01:34:13,933 --> 01:34:16,333
你是說安迪是清白的？
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1275
01:34:16,537 --> 01:34:18,561
我是說，真真正正的無辜的？
I mean, for real innocent?

1276
01:34:18,771 --> 01:34:20,102
看起來是
It looks that way.

1277
01:34:20,540 --> 01:34:22,440
天啊
Sweet Jesus.

1278
01:34:22,708 --> 01:34:24,539
他到這埵釵h久了？
How long has he been here now?

1279
01:34:24,945 --> 01:34:28,209
1947，那是多少，19年
1947. What is that? Nineteen years.

1280
01:34:28,449 --> 01:34:31,043
-湯姆·威廉姆斯 -是，在這
- Williams, Thomas. - Yeah, over here.

1281
01:34:36,890 --> 01:34:38,049
這是什麼？
What you got?

1282
01:34:38,691 --> 01:34:40,022
校董會來的信
Board of Education.

1283
01:34:40,226 --> 01:34:41,750
他竟把它寄出去了
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1284
01:34:41,962 --> 01:34:45,921
你會打開它嗎？還是打自己的屁股？
You going to open it or stand there with your thumb up your butt?

1285
01:34:46,132 --> 01:34:48,293
打自己的屁股聽起來好一點
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1286
01:34:48,802 --> 01:34:51,634
把它還給我，你他媽的
Skeets, come on. Give me that, you shithead.

1287
01:34:52,472 --> 01:34:53,803
別這樣
Floyd, come on.

1288
01:34:59,245 --> 01:35:01,646
請你扔掉它，好嗎？
Will you throw that away, please?

1289
01:35:07,253 --> 01:35:08,982
他媽的
Well, shit.

1290
01:35:21,668 --> 01:35:24,466
那孩子通過了，平均C+
The kid passed. C + average.

1291
01:35:24,671 --> 01:35:26,763
我想你會喜歡的
Thought you'd like to know.

1292
01:35:42,403 --> 01:35:43,871
典獄長要見你
Warden wants to talk.

1293
01:35:57,793 --> 01:35:58,851
就在這堙H
Out here?

1294
01:35:59,061 --> 01:36:01,292
他是這麼說的
That's what the man said.

1295
01:36:17,413 --> 01:36:18,401
典獄長？
Warden?

1296
01:36:19,453 --> 01:36:20,078
湯米

1297
01:36:28,423 --> 01:36:32,485
湯姆，我要你保證這次談話只有我們兩個知道
I'm asking you to keep this conversation just between us.

1298
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:36,261
我感到很艱難
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1299
01:36:54,717 --> 01:36:56,775
這事的情形很特別
We got a situation here.

1300
01:36:57,654 --> 01:36:59,747
我想你可以體會到
I think you can appreciate that.

1301
01:36:59,955 --> 01:37:01,184
是的
Yes, sir.

1302
01:37:01,457 --> 01:37:02,855
我肯定
I sure can.

1303
01:37:03,126 --> 01:37:07,153
告訴你，孩子，這件事讓我承受很大壓力
I tell you, son, this thing really came along and knocked my wind out.

1304
01:37:08,631 --> 01:37:11,190
讓我半夜驚醒，真的
It's got me up nights. That's the truth.

1305
01:37:13,468 --> 01:37:15,300
應該怎麼做
The right thing to do...

1306
01:37:16,972 --> 01:37:20,703
有時很難讓人明白
...sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1307
01:37:21,711 --> 01:37:23,144
你明白了嗎？
Do you understand?

1308
01:37:25,448 --> 01:37:27,039
我需要你的幫助，孩子
I need your help, son.

1309
01:37:28,484 --> 01:37:30,645
如果我要繼續追查下去
If I'm going to move on this...

1310
01:37:30,986 --> 01:37:34,150
就不能有絲毫的疑點
...there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1311
01:37:34,891 --> 01:37:35,949
我必須知道
I have to know...

1312
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:39,987
你跟德弗瑞恩說的是事實嗎？
...if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1313
01:37:40,328 --> 01:37:41,557
千真萬確
Yes, sir.

1314
01:37:41,865 --> 01:37:44,056
那麼你能在法官和陪審團面前……
Absolutely.

1315
01:37:42,135 --> 01:37:45,127
Would you be willing to swear before a judge and jury...

1316
01:37:45,267 --> 01:37:47,258
手放在聖經上……
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1317
01:37:47,470 --> 01:37:50,132
向上帝發誓嗎？
...and take an oath before Almighty God himself?

1318
01:37:50,339 --> 01:37:52,136
只要你給我這個機會
Just give me that chance.

1319
01:37:56,412 --> 01:37:57,743
那也正是我認為的
That's what I thought.

1320
01:38:44,827 --> 01:38:46,726
我想你已經聽說……
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1321
01:38:48,498 --> 01:38:49,520
那個壞消息了
Terrible thing.

1322
01:38:51,133 --> 01:38:52,601
一個這麼年青的人
A man that young...

1323
01:38:52,935 --> 01:38:55,529
還有一年就要出獄了，還想逃獄
...less than a year to go, trying to escape.

1324
01:38:56,071 --> 01:38:58,562
哈德利隊長被迫開槍
Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1325
01:38:59,309 --> 01:39:00,798
那是事實
Truly, it did.

1326
01:39:03,812 --> 01:39:06,247
我們不要再去提那件事了
We just have to put it behind us.

1327
01:39:07,917 --> 01:39:09,145
繼續生活
Move on.

1328
01:39:10,752 --> 01:39:12,243
我已經完了
I'm done.

1329
01:39:13,556 --> 01:39:15,182
一切己結束了
Everything stops.

1330
01:39:17,159 --> 01:39:19,492
找其他人幫你做吧
Get someone else to run your scams.

1331
01:39:20,761 --> 01:39:22,593
任何事都沒停下來
Nothing stops.

1332
01:39:23,932 --> 01:39:25,092
任何事
Nothing.

1333
01:39:28,503 --> 01:39:31,597
否則你在此繼續熬下去
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1334
01:39:32,007 --> 01:39:34,306
再也沒有警衛保護你
No more protection from the guards.

1335
01:39:34,543 --> 01:39:39,446
我會把你從單人牢房轉到同性戀者那
I'll pull you out of that 1 -bunk Hilton and cast you down with the sodomites.

1336
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:43,284
你會覺得你被火車操了
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1337
01:39:44,686 --> 01:39:46,176
至於圖書館？
And the library?

1338
01:39:46,655 --> 01:39:47,645
不存在了
Gone.

1339
01:39:48,664 --> 01:39:50,381
我們用書在院子堹N肉
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1340
01:39:50,858 --> 01:39:52,890
會被一塊塊的磚頭封閉起來
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1341
01:39:53,690 --> 01:39:55,816
幾英里以外都能看見火焰
They'll see the flames for miles.

1342
01:39:56,025 --> 01:39:58,857
我們像土著人那樣圍著書跳舞
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1343
01:40:00,605 --> 01:40:03,597
你明白我的意思了嗎？聽懂了嗎？
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1344
01:40:07,346 --> 01:40:09,211
或許我很愚蠢？
Or am I being obtuse?

1345
01:40:20,993 --> 01:40:23,621
再給他一個月時間考慮清楚
Give him another month to think about it.

1346
01:41:10,576 --> 01:41:13,635
我妻子曾說過我是個很難理解的人
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1347
01:41:14,447 --> 01:41:16,278
像本合著的書
Like a closed book.

1348
01:41:17,081 --> 01:41:19,108
她經常這樣抱怨
Complained about it all the time.

1349
01:41:20,051 --> 01:41:21,609
她很漂亮
She was beautiful.

1350
01:41:24,023 --> 01:41:25,546
上帝，我愛她
God, I loved her.

1351
01:41:29,260 --> 01:41:31,491
只是我不知道如何表達我的感情
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1352
01:41:34,233 --> 01:41:35,894
我殺了她，瑞德
I killed her, Red.

1353
01:41:37,769 --> 01:41:39,567
雖然不是我開的槍
I didn't pull the trigger...

1354
01:41:41,005 --> 01:41:42,734
但是我把她趕走的
...but I drove her away.

1355
01:41:44,242 --> 01:41:46,938
她是因我而死的
That's why she died, because of me...

1356
01:41:47,145 --> 01:41:48,510
因為我對她的態度
...the way I am.

1357
01:41:57,523 --> 01:41:59,354
那不能判你謀殺的
That don't make you a murderer.

1358
01:42:02,728 --> 01:42:04,491
只能說是壞丈夫
Bad husband, maybe.

1359
01:42:08,134 --> 01:42:11,398
你可以為此難過，但槍不是你開的
Feel bad about it if you want, but you didn't pull the trigger.

1360
01:42:11,604 --> 01:42:12,934
不是我殺的
No, I didn't.

1361
01:42:13,339 --> 01:42:15,273
是別人幹的
Somebody else did.

1362
01:42:16,509 --> 01:42:18,601
我在這堸竣F替死鬼
And I wound up in here.

1363
01:42:21,080 --> 01:42:22,671
運氣不好，我想
Bad luck, I guess.

1364
01:42:27,886 --> 01:42:29,319
霉運到處漂浮
It floats around.

1365
01:42:30,355 --> 01:42:32,586
總要有人承受的
It's got to land on somebody.

1366
01:42:33,492 --> 01:42:35,391
剛巧輪到我罷了
It was my turn, that's all.

1367
01:42:36,095 --> 01:42:38,858
我剛好碰上了它
I was in the path of the tornado.

1368
01:42:44,803 --> 01:42:48,761
我只是沒有想到會這麼久
I just didn't expect the storm would last as long as it has.

1369
01:42:53,112 --> 01:42:54,806
想過你有一天能出去嗎？
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1370
01:42:56,047 --> 01:42:57,072
我？
Me?

1371
01:43:00,051 --> 01:43:01,041
有
Yeah.

1372
01:43:02,388 --> 01:43:04,685
有一天，到我頭髮花白……
One day, when I got a long, white beard...

1373
01:43:04,889 --> 01:43:08,053
頭昏眼花的時候
...and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs.

1374
01:43:10,095 --> 01:43:11,721
我告訴你，我會到哪堨h
I tell you where I'd go.

1375
01:43:13,198 --> 01:43:14,859
聖哈塔尼奧
Zihuatanejo.

1376
01:43:15,733 --> 01:43:16,928
什麼？
Say what?

1377
01:43:17,236 --> 01:43:19,067
聖哈塔尼奧
Zihuatanejo.

1378
01:43:20,005 --> 01:43:21,666
在墨西哥
It's in Mexico.

1379
01:43:23,041 --> 01:43:25,169
太平洋中的一個小地方
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1380
01:43:26,312 --> 01:43:29,109
你知道墨西哥人怎麼形容太平洋的
You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific?

1381
01:43:30,916 --> 01:43:32,907
他們說那堿O沒有記憶的地方
They say it has no memory.

1382
01:43:34,886 --> 01:43:37,549
那就是我想渡過餘生的地方
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1383
01:43:39,190 --> 01:43:41,681
一個沒有記憶的溫暖地方
A warm place with no memory.

1384
01:43:44,929 --> 01:43:46,863
開間小旅館
Open up a little hotel...

1385
01:43:48,567 --> 01:43:50,056
就在沙灘邊上
...right on the beach.

1386
01:43:50,669 --> 01:43:52,863
買艘不值錢的舊船回來
Buy some worthless old boat...

1387
01:43:53,404 --> 01:43:55,032
把它翻新
...and fix it up new.

1388
01:43:57,775 --> 01:43:59,004
載著我的客人
Take my guests out...

1389
01:43:59,845 --> 01:44:01,210
出海釣魚
...charter fishing.

1390
01:44:05,050 --> 01:44:06,778
聖哈塔尼奧
Zihuatanejo.

1391
01:44:10,322 --> 01:44:14,189
在那種地方，我需要個能找到東西的人
In a place like that, I could use a man that knows how to get things.

1392
01:44:20,733 --> 01:44:23,565
我覺得外面的社會可能不適合我
I don't think I could make it on the outside.

1393
01:44:30,242 --> 01:44:32,300
我的大半生都在這奡蝜L
I been in here most of my life.

1394
01:44:33,746 --> 01:44:35,509
我已經是這堛漱@部分了
I'm an institutional man now.

1395
01:44:36,415 --> 01:44:38,144
就像布魯克那樣
Just like Brooks was.

1396
01:44:39,617 --> 01:44:41,313
你看輕了你自己
You underestimate yourself.

1397
01:44:41,886 --> 01:44:43,479
我不這樣看
I don't think so.

1398
01:44:47,326 --> 01:44:51,261
在此我能供應物品給你，但是……
In here I'm the guy who can get things for you, sure, but...

1399
01:44:52,031 --> 01:44:54,555
在外面你只需要電話簿黃頁分類
...outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1400
01:44:54,766 --> 01:44:56,996
我不知道如何開始
Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.

1401
01:44:59,138 --> 01:45:00,764
太平洋？
Pacific Ocean?

1402
01:45:01,172 --> 01:45:02,400
Shit.

1403
01:45:02,773 --> 01:45:04,970
那麼大的地方會嚇死我的
Scare me to death, something that big.

1404
01:45:05,176 --> 01:45:06,474
我不怕
Not me.

1405
01:45:07,679 --> 01:45:10,443
我沒開槍殺我妻子，我也沒開槍殺她的情人
I didn't shoot my wife, and I didn't shoot her lover.

1406
01:45:12,184 --> 01:45:15,415
不論我犯了什麼錯，我都已補償了
Whatever mistakes I made, I've paid for them and then some.

1407
01:45:16,455 --> 01:45:17,944
一間旅館和一條船
That hotel, that boat...

1408
01:45:19,724 --> 01:45:21,955
我要的並不太多
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1409
01:45:26,864 --> 01:45:29,299
我勸你不要再想了
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1410
01:45:29,501 --> 01:45:31,525
那只是你的夢想罷了
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1411
01:45:31,970 --> 01:45:34,438
墨西哥在遙遠的天邊，而你在這
Mexico is way down there and you're in here...

1412
01:45:34,639 --> 01:45:36,197
這才是現實
...and that's the way it is.

1413
01:45:36,541 --> 01:45:39,375
是的，是這樣
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1414
01:45:40,879 --> 01:45:43,278
它在遠方，而我在這
It's down there and I'm in here.

1415
01:45:45,850 --> 01:45:48,581
我想只有一個簡單的選擇
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.

1416
01:45:51,489 --> 01:45:52,979
要麼忙著活……
Get busy living...

1417
01:45:54,359 --> 01:45:56,385
要麼忙著死
...or get busy dying.

1418
01:46:00,166 --> 01:46:00,962
安迪

1419
01:46:05,004 --> 01:46:05,868
瑞德

1420
01:46:08,506 --> 01:46:11,237
如果你能出去的話，幫我做件事
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1421
01:46:11,443 --> 01:46:13,706
當然可以，安迪，什麼事都行
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1422
01:46:15,581 --> 01:46:19,448
布克斯頓附近有個草場，你知道在哪媔隉H
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is?

1423
01:46:20,919 --> 01:46:24,046
-那埵陶\多牧場 -有一個很特別……
- A lot of hayfields up there. - One in particular.

1424
01:46:24,255 --> 01:46:28,192
它有很長的石牆，北邊的盡頭有棵橡樹
It's got a long rock wall with a big oak tree at the north end.

1425
01:46:28,394 --> 01:46:31,260
像佛洛斯特的詩描繪的那樣 「佛洛斯特（Robert Frost）：美國著名詩人」
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1426
01:46:32,197 --> 01:46:34,688
那是我向我太太求婚的地方
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1427
01:46:36,100 --> 01:46:38,193
我們到那堨h野餐
We went there for a picnic...

1428
01:46:38,604 --> 01:46:40,697
還在橡樹下做愛
...and made love under that oak...

1429
01:46:41,372 --> 01:46:43,603
我向她求婚，她答應了
...and I asked and she said yes.

1430
01:46:47,613 --> 01:46:49,443
答應我，瑞德
Promise me, Red.

1431
01:46:50,282 --> 01:46:51,908
如果你出去的話
If you ever get out...

1432
01:46:52,117 --> 01:46:53,607
找到那
...find that spot.

1433
01:46:54,787 --> 01:46:59,621
在牆角下，有塊與眾不同的石頭……
At the base of that wall, there's a rock that has no earthly business in Maine.

1434
01:47:00,759 --> 01:47:03,784
一塊黑色的火山玻璃石
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1435
01:47:06,465 --> 01:47:09,126
下面埋著我想給你的東西
Something's buried under it I want you to have.

1436
01:47:09,902 --> 01:47:11,130
是什麼，安迪？
What, Andy?

1437
01:47:11,569 --> 01:47:13,299
埋在那堛漪O什麼？
What's buried under there?

1438
01:47:14,907 --> 01:47:16,772
你自己挖出來……
You'll have to pry it up...

1439
01:47:16,974 --> 01:47:18,237
……就知道了
...to see.

1440
01:47:24,116 --> 01:47:26,083
不，我告訴你，他……
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1441
01:47:26,751 --> 01:47:28,480
他只是在開玩笑
He's talking funny.

1442
01:47:29,587 --> 01:47:31,282
我真的很擔心他
I'm really worried about him.

1443
01:47:31,689 --> 01:47:33,122
那就好好看著他吧
Let's keep an eye on him.

1444
01:47:33,324 --> 01:47:36,590
白天還可以，但晚上怎麼辦？
That's fine during the day, but at night he's all alone.

1445
01:47:38,029 --> 01:47:39,156
上帝
Oh, Lord.

1446
01:47:40,498 --> 01:47:41,328
什麼事？
What?

1447
01:47:42,835 --> 01:47:45,599
安迪今天到我這堥蚢L
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1448
01:47:45,804 --> 01:47:47,897
他問我要了捆繩索
He asked me for a length of rope.

1449
01:47:48,105 --> 01:47:48,935
繩索？
Rope?

1450
01:47:49,139 --> 01:47:50,801
六英尺長
Six feet long.

1451
01:47:51,042 --> 01:47:52,407
那你給他了？
And you gave it to him.

1452
01:47:53,278 --> 01:47:55,074
當然為什麼不呢？
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

1453
01:47:55,279 --> 01:47:56,837
上帝！海伍德
Jesus! Heywood.

1454
01:47:57,448 --> 01:47:59,416
我怎麼知道？
How was I supposed to know?

1455
01:47:59,617 --> 01:48:01,175
還記得布魯克斯嗎？
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1456
01:48:03,188 --> 01:48:05,121
不，安迪不會那樣做的
Andy would never do that.

1457
01:48:05,724 --> 01:48:06,782
永遠不會
Never.

1458
01:48:08,861 --> 01:48:10,192
我不敢肯定
I don't know.

1459
01:48:13,031 --> 01:48:15,055
人總有脆弱的一刻
Every man has his breaking point.

1460
01:48:17,402 --> 01:48:19,666
快點要收工了
Lickety-split. Want to get home.

1461
01:48:19,971 --> 01:48:21,734
還差一點點了
Just about finished, sir.

1462
01:48:38,857 --> 01:48:40,483
今晚有三筆存款
Three deposits tonight.

1463
01:48:48,466 --> 01:48:50,367
把我的衣服拿到洗衣處去
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1464
01:48:50,568 --> 01:48:52,196
還要擦一下我的鞋子
And shine my shoes.

1465
01:48:52,403 --> 01:48:55,339
我要它們看起來像鏡子一樣亮，好的，先生
- I want them looking like mirrors. - Yes, sir.

1466
01:49:00,845 --> 01:49:02,313
你能回來真好，安迪
It's good having you back.

1467
01:49:03,247 --> 01:49:05,113
你不在的話，一切都不一樣了
Place wasn't the same without you.

1468
01:49:51,996 --> 01:49:53,054
熄燈
Lights out!

1469
01:50:25,897 --> 01:50:28,421
那是個輾轉難眠的長夜
I've had some long nights in stir.

1470
01:50:28,966 --> 01:50:31,629
孤獨的黑暗中只有思想
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts...

1471
01:50:31,836 --> 01:50:34,498
時間像把快刀
... time can draw out like a blade.

1472
01:50:39,845 --> 01:50:42,836
那是我一生中最漫長的夜晚
That was the longest night of my life.

1473
01:50:58,697 --> 01:50:59,857
清點人數
Give me a count!

1474
01:51:04,368 --> 01:51:07,202
南邊三樓，人齊了
Tier 3 south, clear!

1475
01:51:10,341 --> 01:51:13,505
二樓245囚室的人不見了
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1476
01:51:13,711 --> 01:51:14,769
德弗瑞恩！
Dufresne!

1477
01:51:15,313 --> 01:51:17,746
快出來！不要耍花樣
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1478
01:51:20,885 --> 01:51:24,287
別要我下來打爆你的頭
Don't make me come down or I'll thump your skull for you!

1479
01:51:31,863 --> 01:51:35,697
他媽的，你不要耽誤我，我還有很多事要做
Damn it, you're putting me behind! I got a schedule to keep.

1480
01:51:35,900 --> 01:51:39,199
你最好是病了或者死了
You'd better be sick or dead in there. I shit you not!

1481
01:51:39,403 --> 01:51:40,734
你聽到了嗎？
You hear me?

1482
01:51:46,845 --> 01:51:48,938
啊，我的上帝！
Oh, my Holy God.

1483
01:52:05,930 --> 01:52:08,491
查問這堛漕C一個犯人
I want every man on this cellblock questioned.

1484
01:52:08,934 --> 01:52:11,493
-從他的好朋友開始 -誰？
- Start with that friend of his. - Who?

1485
01:52:11,934 --> 01:52:13,493
他！

1486
01:52:14,072 --> 01:52:15,630
打開237號的門
Open 237.

1487
01:52:19,144 --> 01:52:22,806
你什麼意思，「他不在這了」？別跟我說這種話
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"? Don't say that to me.

1488
01:52:23,681 --> 01:52:25,013
別再這樣說
Don't tell me that again.

1489
01:52:25,216 --> 01:52:26,241
但是長官，他真的不在那
But sir, he wasn't.

1490
01:52:26,484 --> 01:52:29,943
我看得見！你認為我瞎了嗎？
I can see that, Haig! Think I'm blind?

1491
01:52:30,621 --> 01:52:32,020
這就是你想說的嗎？
Is that what you're saying?

1492
01:52:32,224 --> 01:52:34,885
-我瞎了嗎？ -沒有！長官
- Am I blind, Haig? - No, sir!

1493
01:52:35,794 --> 01:52:38,284
那你呢？你瞎了嗎？
What about you. You blind?

1494
01:52:38,796 --> 01:52:41,357
-告訴我這是什麼？ -昨晚的查房記錄
- Tell me what this is. - Last night's count.

1495
01:52:41,565 --> 01:52:44,864
你看到德弗瑞恩的名字嗎？我確定，就在那
You see Dufresne's name there? I sure do. Right there.

1496
01:52:45,069 --> 01:52:46,400
「德弗瑞恩」
"Dufresne."

1497
01:52:48,072 --> 01:52:49,540
他熄燈的時候
He was in his cell...

1498
01:52:49,773 --> 01:52:50,742
還在囚室堛
...at lights out.

1499
01:52:50,942 --> 01:52:53,206
因此今早他也應該在
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

1500
01:52:54,246 --> 01:52:55,872
我要找到他
I want him found.

1501
01:52:56,081 --> 01:52:59,538
不是明天，不是早飯後，是現在
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1502
01:52:59,784 --> 01:53:00,979
是的，長官
Yes, sir.

1503
01:53:01,987 --> 01:53:04,251
快走
Let's go. Move your butts.

1504
01:53:07,658 --> 01:53:08,648
站好
Stand.

1505
01:53:10,095 --> 01:53:11,153
那麼？
Well?

1506
01:53:14,599 --> 01:53:15,587
那麼，什麼？
Well, what?

1507
01:53:15,800 --> 01:53:19,259
你們常在一起，親密得像做賊一樣
I see you two all the time. You're thick as thieves, you are.

1508
01:53:20,337 --> 01:53:21,827
他肯定對你說過些什麼
He must have said something.

1509
01:53:22,573 --> 01:53:24,098
沒有，先生，獄長
No, sir, Warden.

1510
01:53:24,475 --> 01:53:25,443
什麼都沒說
Not a word.

1511
01:53:27,278 --> 01:53:29,839
主啊，這是個奇跡
Lord, it's a miracle!

1512
01:53:30,447 --> 01:53:33,007
人就像屁一樣在風中消失了
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1513
01:53:33,684 --> 01:53:34,845
什麼都沒留下
Nothing left...

1514
01:53:35,687 --> 01:53:38,416
只剩下窗台上的石頭
...but some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1515
01:53:38,622 --> 01:53:41,353
和那牆上的小妞，問問她吧
And that cupcake on the wall. Let's ask her.

1516
01:53:41,559 --> 01:53:43,322
也許她知道些什麼
Maybe she knows.

1517
01:53:43,562 --> 01:53:46,291
你想說什麼？
What say there, fuzzy-britches? Feel like talking?

1518
01:53:47,732 --> 01:53:49,028
我想沒有
Guess not.

1519
01:53:49,600 --> 01:53:51,796
為什麼她有點特別？
Why should she be any different?

1520
01:53:52,871 --> 01:53:54,532
這是一個陰謀
This is a conspiracy.

1521
01:53:55,172 --> 01:53:57,004
肯定是的
That's what this is.

1522
01:53:57,608 --> 01:54:01,340
一個該死的大陰謀
One big, damn conspiracy!

1523
01:54:01,613 --> 01:54:03,604
所有人都有參與
And everyone's in on it!

1524
01:54:04,248 --> 01:54:05,408
包括她
Including her!

1525
01:54:40,452 --> 01:54:42,147
在1966年
In 1966...

1526
01:54:42,354 --> 01:54:44,754
安迪·德弗瑞恩從肖申克監獄……
... Andy Dufresne escaped...

1527
01:54:44,956 --> 01:54:46,514
逃了出去
... from Shawshank Prison.

1528
01:54:48,760 --> 01:54:51,319
他們只能找到泥塘中的囚衣……
All they found was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1529
01:54:51,962 --> 01:54:53,487
一塊肥皂……
... a bar of soap...

1530
01:54:53,697 --> 01:54:55,255
和一個很舊的手槌
... and an old rock hammer...

1531
01:54:55,466 --> 01:54:57,934
幾乎快被削成一小塊
... damn near worn down to the nub.

1532
01:55:02,439 --> 01:55:07,206
我曾認為用手槌要六百年才能掘通的隧道
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1533
01:55:07,845 --> 01:55:10,474
安迪用不到二十年就辦到了
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1534
01:55:28,766 --> 01:55:31,064
安迪很喜歡地質學
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1535
01:55:31,836 --> 01:55:34,998
我能想像這歸功於他一絲不茍的本性
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1536
01:55:35,407 --> 01:55:37,238
如果這埵酗@段冰河時期
An ice age here...

1537
01:55:37,675 --> 01:55:40,166
百萬年後，山脈就會在那塈峖
... million years of mountain building there.

1538
01:55:41,179 --> 01:55:44,011
地質學是關於壓力和時間的研究
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1539
01:55:44,849 --> 01:55:46,840
需要的僅僅就是這些
That's all it takes, really.

1540
01:55:47,585 --> 01:55:48,676
壓力……
Pressure...

1541
01:55:49,321 --> 01:55:50,581
……和時間
... and time.

1542
01:55:51,922 --> 01:55:53,982
還有一張大海報
That and a big goddamn poster.

1543
01:55:58,028 --> 01:55:58,961
就像我說的那樣
Like I said...

1544
01:55:59,464 --> 01:56:03,456
監獄堛漱H都會找事情來消磨時間
... in prison, a man will do anything to keep his mind occupied.

1545
01:56:06,270 --> 01:56:11,072
看起來安迪的愛好是把他的牆搬運到廣場上
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting his wall out into the exercise yard...

1546
01:56:11,608 --> 01:56:13,542
每次一把
... a handful at a time.

1547
01:56:14,845 --> 01:56:16,904
我猜在湯姆被殺後
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1548
01:56:17,114 --> 01:56:20,083
安迪覺得他在此呆得已夠久了
... Andy decided he'd been here long enough.

1549
01:56:20,284 --> 01:56:22,845
盡快，我要回家了
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1550
01:56:23,587 --> 01:56:25,613
我馬上就好了
I'm just about finished, sir.

1551
01:56:47,077 --> 01:56:49,011
今晚有三筆存款
Three deposits tonight.

1552
01:56:56,321 --> 01:56:58,618
安迪照他的吩咐
Andy did like he was told.

1553
01:56:58,822 --> 01:57:02,314
把鞋擦得閃閃發亮
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.

1554
01:57:05,996 --> 01:57:08,295
警衛完全沒有注意到
The guards simply didn't notice.

1555
01:57:08,599 --> 01:57:10,067
我也沒有
Neither did I.

1556
01:57:10,268 --> 01:57:11,791
說真的
I mean, seriously...

1557
01:57:12,002 --> 01:57:14,995
誰會留意別人穿的鞋子呢？
... how often do you really look at a man's shoes?

1558
01:59:18,563 --> 01:59:21,725
安迪朝向自由爬了五百碼
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards...

1559
01:59:21,965 --> 01:59:25,299
我難以想像有多臭的下水道
... of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1560
01:59:26,304 --> 01:59:28,635
或許我只是不想去爬
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1561
01:59:33,044 --> 01:59:35,409
五百碼
Five hundred yards.

1562
01:59:35,913 --> 01:59:38,974
有五個足球場那麼長
That's the length of five football fields.

1563
01:59:39,617 --> 01:59:42,176
有半英里左右
Just shy of half a mile.

1564
02:00:37,407 --> 02:00:42,004
第二天早上，就在那海報被撕下來的時候
The next morning, right about the time Raquel was spilling her secret...

1565
02:00:42,313 --> 02:00:45,145
一個從未出現過的人
... a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...

1566
02:00:45,382 --> 02:00:47,976
走進了緬因州國家銀行
... strolled into the Maine National Bank.

1567
02:00:48,553 --> 02:00:51,715
在那一刻前，他從來是不存在的
Until that moment, he didn't exist.

1568
02:00:52,290 --> 02:00:54,656
-除了在紙上 -我可以幫忙嗎？
- Except on paper. - May I help you?

1569
02:00:55,059 --> 02:00:56,992
他有所有正確的身份證明文件……
He had all the proper ID...

1570
02:00:57,194 --> 02:01:00,891
駕駛執照、出生證明、社會安全證……
... driver's license, birth certificate, Social Security card...

1571
02:01:01,331 --> 02:01:03,857
簽名也是正確的
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1572
02:01:04,068 --> 02:01:07,162
不能再為你服務真的很遺憾
I must say I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1573
02:01:07,371 --> 02:01:09,100
希望你在國外生活愉快
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1574
02:01:09,907 --> 02:01:10,998
謝謝
Thank you.

1575
02:01:11,675 --> 02:01:12,836
我想我會的
I'm sure I will.

1576
02:01:13,745 --> 02:01:17,077
先生，這是你的本票，還有別的嗎？
Here's your cashier's check, sir. Will there be anything else?

1577
02:01:17,282 --> 02:01:18,270
請問
Please.

1578
02:01:18,849 --> 02:01:21,340
你能幫我把它寄出嗎？
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1579
02:01:21,853 --> 02:01:23,046
我很樂意
I'd be happy to.

1580
02:01:24,855 --> 02:01:26,187
-再見 -走好，先生
Good day, sir.

1581
02:01:27,125 --> 02:01:31,562
史蒂文先生那天早上去了將近十二家銀行
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks in the Portland area that morning.

1582
02:01:32,029 --> 02:01:33,621
加起來
All told, he blew town...

1583
02:01:33,831 --> 02:01:38,666
他總共提取了三十七萬諾頓獄長的錢
... with better than $370,000 of Warden Norton's money.

1584
02:01:39,370 --> 02:01:42,134
作為十九年的賠償
Severance pay for 19 years.

1585
02:01:49,380 --> 02:01:51,574
早上好，波特蘭時報
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1586
02:01:52,051 --> 02:01:54,781
「肖申克監獄,貪污謀殺」

1587
02:02:02,695 --> 02:02:05,061
「主的審判迅速降臨」

1588
02:02:21,680 --> 02:02:24,513
「親愛的典獄長,你說的對」

1589
02:02:24,550 --> 02:02:26,347
「得救之道,就在其中」

1590
02:02:43,734 --> 02:02:46,670
拜倫·哈德利？你有權保持沉默
Byron Hadley? You have the right to remain silent.

1591
02:02:46,938 --> 02:02:51,274
否則你所說的一切都將對你不利
If you give up this right, anything you say can be held against you in court.

1592
02:02:52,510 --> 02:02:55,970
我雖沒有親眼看到，但我聽說他被帶走時
I wasn't there to see, but I hear Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1593
02:02:56,180 --> 02:02:57,671
哭得像個娘們
... when they took him away.

1594
02:03:03,954 --> 02:03:06,956
諾頓沒有靜靜離開的意思
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1595
02:03:23,808 --> 02:03:24,638
森姆·諾頓？
Samuel Norton.

1596
02:03:25,443 --> 02:03:27,876
我們有拘捕令，開門！
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

1597
02:03:32,617 --> 02:03:33,708
開門吧
Open the door.

1598
02:03:34,251 --> 02:03:35,514
我不知是哪把鑰匙
I'm not sure which key.

1599
02:03:45,662 --> 02:03:47,596
別緊張，諾頓
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1600
02:03:59,109 --> 02:04:02,568
我想知道當子彈穿過他的頭的時候
I like to think the last thing that went through his head...

1601
02:04:02,779 --> 02:04:04,371
他在想些什麼
... other than that bullet...

1602
02:04:04,581 --> 02:04:09,019
是在想該死的安迪.德弗瑞恩到底是如何擊敗他？
... was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1603
02:04:11,522 --> 02:04:14,979
諾頓獄長一夥倒台之後
Not long after the warden deprived us of his company...

1604
02:04:15,259 --> 02:04:17,318
我收到了張明信片
... I got a postcard in the mail.

1605
02:04:18,796 --> 02:04:21,629
它是空白的，但是郵戳是……
It was blank, but the postmark said...

1606
02:04:21,831 --> 02:04:23,960
漢格堡，德薩斯州的
... Fort Hancock, Texas.

1607
02:04:24,201 --> 02:04:25,567
漢格堡
Fort Hancock...

1608
02:04:25,836 --> 02:04:27,566
就在邊境那
... right on the border.

1609
02:04:27,972 --> 02:04:29,963
安迪就是從那堨X國的
That's where Andy crossed.

1610
02:04:30,541 --> 02:04:34,671
當我想到他開車向南走的時候
When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down...

1611
02:04:35,013 --> 02:04:37,242
我總會笑起來
... it always makes me laugh.

1612
02:04:39,082 --> 02:04:40,640
安迪·德弗瑞恩
Andy Dufresne...

1613
02:04:41,018 --> 02:04:43,044
爬過了那臭屎溝
... who crawled through a river of shit...

1614
02:04:43,254 --> 02:04:45,653
然後乾乾淨淨的到另一邊去了
... and came out clean on the other side.

1615
02:04:46,491 --> 02:04:47,856
安迪·德弗瑞恩
Andy Dufresne...

1616
02:04:48,660 --> 02:04:50,251
向太平洋進發
... headed for the Pacific.

1617
02:04:53,231 --> 02:04:55,392
哈德利抓住他的頭，對嗎？
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?

1618
02:04:55,598 --> 02:04:59,399
他說，「我相信他將會發生意外」
He says, " I believe this boy's about to have himself an accident."

1619
02:04:59,603 --> 02:05:02,470
我們跟他熟的老是談起安迪
Those of us who knew him best talk about him often.

1620
02:05:03,140 --> 02:05:04,835
我發誓，他總是帶來話題
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1621
02:05:05,042 --> 02:05:08,012
「我的朋友可以要兩瓶啤酒」
"My friends could use a couple of beers."

1622
02:05:08,345 --> 02:05:10,006
他成功了
And he got it!

1623
02:05:11,249 --> 02:05:13,648
有時那令我傷心，雖然……
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1624
02:05:13,917 --> 02:05:15,350
安迪已經離開了
... Andy being gone.

1625
02:05:16,054 --> 02:05:20,183
我不得不提醒自己有些鳥是不能關在籠子堛
I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1626
02:05:20,656 --> 02:05:22,716
它們的羽毛太光亮
Their feathers are just too bright.

1627
02:05:24,429 --> 02:05:26,156
當它們飛走的時候
And when they fly away...

1628
02:05:26,598 --> 02:05:31,000
你會覺得把它們關起來是種罪惡
... the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1629
02:05:32,070 --> 02:05:33,331
但是
But still...

1630
02:05:33,804 --> 02:05:38,138
它們的離開讓你生活的地方空蕩蕩的
... the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone.

1631
02:05:42,347 --> 02:05:44,713
可能我只是想念我的朋友了
I guess I just miss my friend.

1632
02:06:09,406 --> 02:06:10,339
請坐
Please sit down.

1633
02:06:16,179 --> 02:06:17,737
瑞德
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1634
02:06:18,281 --> 02:06:21,548
你因終身監禁已被關了40年了
...your files say you've served 40 years of a life sentence.

1635
02:06:22,353 --> 02:06:24,479
你覺得你已改過了嗎？
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1636
02:06:26,357 --> 02:06:27,915
改過？
Rehabilitated?

1637
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:31,861
讓我想想
Well, now, let me see.

1638
02:06:32,863 --> 02:06:35,196
我不明白那是什麼意思
I don't have any idea what that means.

1639
02:06:37,301 --> 02:06:39,566
你有心理準備重新投入社會嗎？
It means you're ready to rejoin society...

1640
02:06:40,138 --> 02:06:42,469
我知道你們是怎麼想的，老弟
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1641
02:06:44,642 --> 02:06:46,633
對我來說那只是個用來掩飾的詞
To me it's just a made-up word.

1642
02:06:47,978 --> 02:06:50,311
政客用的詞語
A politician's word so that...

1643
02:06:50,747 --> 02:06:54,274
讓你們年青人能穿西裝打領帶
...young fellas like yourself can wear a suit and a tie...

1644
02:06:54,751 --> 02:06:56,344
有一份好工作
...and have a job.

1645
02:06:58,322 --> 02:07:00,415
你倒底想知道些什麼？
What do you really want to know?

1646
02:07:01,192 --> 02:07:03,160
我對自己所犯的罪感到後悔嗎？
Am I sorry for what I did?

1647
02:07:03,394 --> 02:07:04,554
你有後悔嗎？
Well, are you?

1648
02:07:06,464 --> 02:07:09,296
沒有一天我不感到後悔的
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1649
02:07:10,667 --> 02:07:14,126
不是因為我在監獄堙A或者你認為我該這樣
Not because I'm in here or because you think I should.

1650
02:07:17,608 --> 02:07:20,169
我回首過往
I look back on the way I was then...

1651
02:07:22,313 --> 02:07:23,473
一個年青的……
...a young...

1652
02:07:24,581 --> 02:07:28,073
愚蠢的孩子犯了大罪
...stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1653
02:07:31,089 --> 02:07:32,783
我想和他談談
I want to talk to him.

1654
02:07:34,725 --> 02:07:37,193
我想和他講講道理
I want to try and talk some sense to him.

1655
02:07:37,929 --> 02:07:39,863
告訴他做人道理
Tell him the way things are.

1656
02:07:41,965 --> 02:07:43,398
但已經不能了
But I can't.

1657
02:07:45,603 --> 02:07:47,594
那孩子已無影無蹤
That kid's long gone...

1658
02:07:48,805 --> 02:07:51,569
只剩下這個老人
...and this old man is all that's left.

1659
02:07:52,976 --> 02:07:54,443
我得這樣生活下去
I got to live with that.

1660
02:07:55,813 --> 02:07:57,507
改過？
Rehabilitated?

1661
02:07:57,881 --> 02:07:59,712
只是個狗屁的字眼
It's just a bullshit word.

1662
02:08:00,652 --> 02:08:05,419
你繼續蓋上你的印章吧，老弟，別再浪費我的時間了
So you go on and stamp your forms, sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1663
02:08:06,657 --> 02:08:08,921
說句實話
Because to tell you the truth...

1664
02:08:09,260 --> 02:08:11,251
我根本不在乎
...I don't give a shit.

1665
02:08:24,360 --> 02:08:25,651
「通過」

1666
02:09:21,382 --> 02:09:23,347
「布魯斯到此」

1667
02:09:37,782 --> 02:09:39,180
你的，小姐
Here you go, miss.

1668
02:09:42,120 --> 02:09:43,144
我可以去洗手間嗎？
Restroom break?

1669
02:09:48,960 --> 02:09:53,488
你不用每次都問我，去吧
You don't need to ask me every time you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1670
02:10:06,544 --> 02:10:09,604
四十年來我小便都要經過批准
Forty years I've been asking permission to piss.

1671
02:10:10,447 --> 02:10:13,439
不批准的話一滴都尿不出來
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1672
02:10:16,953 --> 02:10:19,114
現實是很難面對的
There's a harsh truth to face.

1673
02:10:20,791 --> 02:10:23,693
我不習慣外面的生活
No way I'm going to make it on the outside.

1674
02:10:31,568 --> 02:10:35,264
我總在想怎樣才能違反假釋條例
All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole...

1675
02:10:36,073 --> 02:10:38,541
那樣他們會把我再送進去
... so maybe they'd send me back.

1676
02:10:43,747 --> 02:10:46,181
生活在恐懼中是很可怕的
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1677
02:10:47,085 --> 02:10:48,746
布魯克是知道的
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1678
02:10:48,952 --> 02:10:50,886
他知道得太清楚了
Knew it all too well.

1679
02:10:52,489 --> 02:10:55,889
我只想回到能適合我的地方
All I want is to be back where things make sense.

1680
02:10:56,327 --> 02:10:59,056
令我不用再擔心受怕的地方
Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1681
02:11:01,064 --> 02:11:03,430
只有一件事阻止了我這麼做
Only one thing stops me.

1682
02:11:04,868 --> 02:11:07,269
我對安迪作出的承諾
A promise I made to Andy.

1683
02:11:27,791 --> 02:11:28,917
就在那
There it is.

1684
02:11:39,537 --> 02:11:41,197
非常感謝，先生
Much obliged, sir.

1685
02:11:51,082 --> 02:11:52,347
「布克斯頓」

1686
02:15:20,523 --> 02:15:21,786
親愛的瑞德
Dear Red:

1687
02:15:22,025 --> 02:15:24,493
若你能看到這封信，那你已經出來了
If you're reading this, you've gotten out...

1688
02:15:24,694 --> 02:15:28,755
……如果你已來了這麼遠，也許可以再前進一點
... and if you've come this far, maybe you'd come a bit further.

1689
02:15:29,032 --> 02:15:31,501
你還記得那個地方的名字，是嗎？
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1690
02:15:33,804 --> 02:15:35,294
聖哈塔尼奧
Zihuatanejo.

1691
02:15:36,940 --> 02:15:40,536
我需要一個人和我一起工作
I could use a good man to help me get my project on wheels.

1692
02:15:41,045 --> 02:15:44,572
我期待你的到來，計劃已經擺好了
I'll keep an eye out for you, and the chessboard ready.

1693
02:15:45,382 --> 02:15:46,782
記住，瑞德
Remember, Red...

1694
02:15:47,117 --> 02:15:49,211
有希望是件好事情
... hope is a good thing...

1695
02:15:49,420 --> 02:15:51,411
也許是世間最好的事情
... maybe the best of things.

1696
02:15:51,621 --> 02:15:53,782
好的事情從不會逝去
And no good thing ever dies.

1697
02:15:54,324 --> 02:15:57,192
我希望這封信能見到你
I will be hoping that this letter finds you...

1698
02:15:57,394 --> 02:15:59,123
見到你很好
... and finds you well.

1699
02:15:59,630 --> 02:16:00,858
你的朋友
Your friend...

1700
02:16:01,064 --> 02:16:02,224
安迪
... Andy.

1701
02:16:36,066 --> 02:16:37,795
「要麼忙著活」
"Get busy living...

1702
02:16:38,002 --> 02:16:39,901
「要麼忙著死」
... or get busy dying. "

1703
02:16:42,605 --> 02:16:44,766
這話一點都沒錯
That's goddamn right.

1704
02:16:47,445 --> 02:16:49,748
「瑞德也來過」

1705
02:16:50,012 --> 02:16:52,139
我一生中第二次……
For the second time in my life...

1706
02:16:52,383 --> 02:16:54,941
犯了罪
... I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1707
02:16:56,020 --> 02:16:57,954
違反了假釋條例
Parole violation.

1708
02:16:58,620 --> 02:17:02,284
當然，我懷疑他們會因此設下路障
Of course I doubt they'll toss up any roadblocks for that.

1709
02:17:02,959 --> 02:17:04,985
尤其是像我這樣的老人家
Not for an old crook like me.

1710
02:17:05,196 --> 02:17:07,221
德薩斯州，漢格堡
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1711
02:17:10,900 --> 02:17:15,633
我發現我很激動，幾乎坐不住，思緒紛亂
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1712
02:17:16,073 --> 02:17:19,405
這是一個自由人才能感受到的
I think it's the excitement only a free man can feel.

1713
02:17:19,610 --> 02:17:22,100
一個自由人開始了漫長的旅程
A free man at the start of a long journey...

1714
02:17:22,312 --> 02:17:24,905
伴隨著未知的結局
... whose conclusion is uncertain.

1715
02:17:27,918 --> 02:17:30,579
我希望我能成功越過邊界
I hope I can make it across the border.

1716
02:17:32,088 --> 02:17:35,114
我希望看見我的朋友，和他握手
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1717
02:17:36,993 --> 02:17:41,054
我希望太平洋的海水如我夢中那樣的藍
I hope the Pacific is as blue as it has been in my dreams.

1718
02:17:42,982 --> 02:17:44,108
我希望……
I hope.

1719
02:18:18,636 --> 02:18:23,539
「謹此紀念亞倫格林」

1720
02:18:26,778 --> 02:18:31,477
劇終 謝謝收看

1721
02:18:32,778 --> 02:18:41,477
