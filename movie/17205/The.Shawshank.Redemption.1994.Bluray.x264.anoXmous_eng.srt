00:02:04,623 --> 00:02:06,624
Mr. Dufresne,

19
00:02:06,708 --> 00:02:10,961
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

20
00:02:15,592 --> 00:02:17,718
It was very bitter.

21
00:02:17,802 --> 00:02:22,222
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

22
00:02:23,642 --> 00:02:27,186
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

23
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,104
What was your response?

24
00:02:29,189 --> 00:02:31,148
I told her I would not grant one.

25
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:34,276
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

26
00:02:34,361 --> 00:02:38,030
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne,
according to your neighbors.

27
00:02:39,157 --> 00:02:42,826
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

28
00:02:43,954 --> 00:02:47,456
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

29
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,458
She packed a bag.

30
00:02:50,543 --> 00:02:53,712
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

31
00:02:53,797 --> 00:02:56,090
DA: Glenn Quentin.

32
00:02:56,174 --> 00:02:58,258
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

33
00:02:58,343 --> 00:03:02,221
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

34
00:03:03,974 --> 00:03:05,349
Did you follow her?

35
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,769
I went to a few bars first.

36
00:03:08,853 --> 00:03:11,730
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

37
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:15,401
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

38
00:03:15,485 --> 00:03:17,069
and waited.

39
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:19,363
DA: With what intention?

40
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:21,240
DUFRESNE: I'm not sure.

41
00:03:21,324 --> 00:03:23,534
I was confused.

42
00:03:23,618 --> 00:03:25,285
Drunk.

43
00:03:27,038 --> 00:03:30,040
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

44
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,377
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

45
00:03:33,461 --> 00:03:36,547
No. I was sobering up.

46
00:03:36,631 --> 00:03:39,383
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

47
00:03:39,467 --> 00:03:42,928
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

48
00:03:43,013 --> 00:03:45,222
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

49
00:03:45,306 --> 00:03:49,101
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

50
00:03:49,185 --> 00:03:54,857
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with .38 caliber bullets.

51
00:03:55,900 --> 00:04:00,154
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

52
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:02,072
(Whispers) Yes, it does.

53
00:04:02,157 --> 00:04:08,245
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

54
00:04:08,329 --> 00:04:12,124
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

55
00:04:12,208 --> 00:04:16,920
DA: The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

56
00:04:17,005 --> 00:04:19,798
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

57
00:04:19,883 --> 00:04:24,053
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

58
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:28,223
And that also...

59
00:04:28,308 --> 00:04:30,309
is very convenient.

60
00:04:30,393 --> 00:04:31,894
Isn’t it, Mr. Dufresne?

61
00:04:33,104 --> 00:04:35,355
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

62
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,026
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

We have footprints, tire tracks,

70

lying dead in each other's arms.

75
00:05:19,943 --> 00:05:22,194
They had sinned.

..think about this.

79
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,918
A revolver holds six bullets.

80
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:39,378
Not eight.

81
00:05:39,462 --> 00:05:42,923
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

82
00:05:43,007 --> 00:05:46,051
That could be understood, if not condoned.

83
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:48,762
No. This was revenge...

84
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:53,350
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

85
00:05:53,434 --> 00:05:55,978
Four bullets per victim.

86
00:05:56,062 --> 00:05:58,438
Not six shots fired, but eight.

87
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:02,442
That means that he fired the gun empty,

88
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:04,820
and then stopped to reload...

89
00:06:05,905 --> 00:06:08,490
..so that he could shoot each of them again.

90
00:06:08,575 --> 00:06:11,160
An extra bullet per lover.

91
00:06:11,244 --> 00:06:13,287

By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine,

96
00:06:29,387 --> 00:06:32,931
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences,
back to back.

97
00:06:34,017 --> 00:06:36,643

We see by your file
you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

101
00:07:10,386 --> 00:07:11,970
Yes, sir.

102
00:07:12,055 --> 00:07:14,514
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

103
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:16,808
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

104
00:07:18,436 --> 00:07:20,395
I mean, I learned my lesson.

105

I can honestly say...I'm a changed man.

I'm no longer a danger to society.

Same old shit. Different day.

110
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:18,328
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

111
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:22,082
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

112
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:23,458
It happens.

113
00:08:23,543 --> 00:08:25,127
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

114
00:08:25,211 --> 00:08:28,588
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

115
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:29,881
- Four.
- Five.

116

in every prison in America.

117
00:08:34,554 --> 00:08:36,471
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

118
00:08:36,556 --> 00:08:39,683
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer - if that's your thing -

119

a bottle of brandy

120

00:08:45,857 --> 00:08:48,150

So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

124
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:59,286
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him,

125
00:08:59,370 --> 00:09:01,455
I told him, "No problem."

126
00:09:43,539 --> 00:09:45,832
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

127
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:50,045
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

128
00:09:50,129 --> 00:09:54,424
On the outside he had been vice-president
of a large Portland bank.

129
00:09:54,509 --> 00:09:56,510
Good work for a man as young as he was.

130
00:09:56,594 --> 00:09:58,678
(Applause and whistling)

131
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:03,558
Hey, Red.

132
00:10:05,395 --> 00:10:07,312
(Whistling)

133
00:10:07,397 --> 00:10:09,564

You follow this officer.

137
00:10:56,237 --> 00:11:00,615
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap
of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

138

139
00:11:17,842 --> 00:11:20,719

- Come on, fish.

140
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,101
Taking bets today, Red?

141
00:11:28,186 --> 00:11:30,187
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

142
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:32,063
Smokes. Put me down for two.

143
00:11:32,148 --> 00:11:34,191
All right. Who's your horse?

144
00:11:34,275 --> 00:11:37,569
That little sack of shit...eighth from the front.

145
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:38,820
He'll be first.

146
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:41,114
- Bullshit. I'll take that action.
- Me too.

147
00:11:41,199 --> 00:11:43,450
You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

148
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,452
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

150
00:11:48,122 --> 00:11:51,500

Put me down for a quarter deck.

151
00:11:51,584 --> 00:11:54,461
(Men shouting)
- Fresh fish!

152
00:11:54,545 --> 00:11:58,632
Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

153
00:11:58,716 --> 00:12:02,969
RED: I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy,
first time I laid eyes on him.

154
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:06,556
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

155
00:12:06,641 --> 00:12:08,934
That was my first impression of the man.

156
00:12:09,018 --> 00:12:10,727
MAN: What do you say, Red?

157
00:12:10,811 --> 00:12:14,064
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

158
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:16,316
That guy? Never happen.

159
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,526
Ten cigarettes.

160
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:18,777
That's a rich bet.

161
00:12:18,861 --> 00:12:21,071
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

162
00:12:21,155 --> 00:12:23,240
Heywood? Jigger?

163
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:24,783
Skeet?

164
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:27,077
Floyd?

165
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:29,287
Four brave souls.

166
00:12:29,372 --> 00:12:32,207
TANNOY:
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

167
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,793
All prisoners return to your cell blocks.

168
00:12:55,898 --> 00:12:57,983
Turn to the right. Eyes front.

169
00:13:11,414 --> 00:13:14,416
This is Mr. Hadley. He's Captain of the Guards.

170
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,668
I'm Mr. Norton, the Warden.

171
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:19,254
You are convicted felons.

172
00:13:19,338 --> 00:13:21,673
That's why they've sent you to me.

173
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,383
Rule number one:

174
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:25,343
No blasphemy.

175
00:13:25,428 --> 00:13:28,972
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain
in my prison.

176
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:30,432
The other rules...

177
00:13:30,516 --> 00:13:32,225
you'll figure out as you go along.

178
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,102
Any questions?

179
00:13:34,186 --> 00:13:35,395
When do we eat?

180
00:13:43,904 --> 00:13:46,072
HADLEY: You eat when we say you eat!

181
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:49,534
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

182
00:13:49,619 --> 00:13:52,495
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

183
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:53,872
Aarghh!

184
00:13:53,956 --> 00:13:55,915
On your feet.

185
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,792
NORTON: I believe in two things.

186
00:13:57,877 --> 00:14:00,754
Discipline and the Bible.

187
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:02,672
Here you'll receive both.

188
00:14:03,799 --> 00:14:06,426
Put your trust in the Lord.

189
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,386
Your ass belongs to me.

190
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:12,557
Welcome to Shawshank.

191
00:14:17,688 --> 00:14:19,105
Unhook 'em.

192
00:14:24,362 --> 00:14:26,237
Turn around.

193
00:14:32,662 --> 00:14:34,996
That's enough.

194
00:14:35,081 --> 00:14:37,832
Move to the end of the cage.

195
00:14:37,917 --> 00:14:39,292
Turn around.

196
00:14:39,377 --> 00:14:40,627
Delouse him.

197
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:43,713
Turn around.

198
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,469
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

199
00:14:49,553 --> 00:14:51,096
Next man up.

200
00:14:53,224 --> 00:14:56,393
To the right. Right, right, right.

201
00:14:56,477 --> 00:14:58,019
Left, left...

202
00:14:58,104 --> 00:15:02,273
RED: The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

203
00:15:02,358 --> 00:15:05,485
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

204
00:15:05,569 --> 00:15:09,656
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit they throw on you.

205
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:12,701
And when they put you in that cell,

206
00:15:12,785 --> 00:15:15,453
and those bars slam home...

207
00:15:15,538 --> 00:15:18,289
that's when you know it's for real.

208
00:15:18,374 --> 00:15:21,710
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

209
00:15:21,794 --> 00:15:23,002
Nothing left,

210
00:15:23,087 --> 00:15:25,797
but all the time in the world to think about it.

211
00:15:27,049 --> 00:15:30,802
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

212
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:34,180
Somebody always breaks down crying.

213
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,725
Happens every time.

214
00:15:36,809 --> 00:15:38,893
The only question is:

215
00:15:38,978 --> 00:15:40,395
Who's it gonna be?

216
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,065
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

217
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:48,069
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

218
00:15:57,705 --> 00:15:59,330
Lights out!

219
00:15:59,415 --> 00:16:02,083
(Click of light switches)

220
00:16:19,852 --> 00:16:22,937
RED: I remember my first night.

221
00:16:23,022 --> 00:16:25,106
Seems like a long time ago.

222
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:29,110
MAN: Yoo-hoo!

223
00:16:29,195 --> 00:16:31,696
Hey, fish.

224
00:16:31,781 --> 00:16:34,824
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

225
00:16:34,909 --> 00:16:38,828
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

226
00:16:38,913 --> 00:16:41,247
You'll wish
your daddy never dicked your mommy.

227
00:16:41,332 --> 00:16:45,335
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

228
00:16:45,419 --> 00:16:50,465
You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

229
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:53,927
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

230
00:16:54,011 --> 00:16:57,347
RED: The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

231
00:16:57,431 --> 00:16:59,474
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

232
00:16:59,558 --> 00:17:02,060
(Men whispering in background)

233
00:17:02,144 --> 00:17:04,646
Hey, Fat Ass.

234
00:17:04,730 --> 00:17:06,397
Fat Ass.

235
00:17:07,608 --> 00:17:10,068
Talk to me, boy.

236
00:17:10,152 --> 00:17:12,862
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

237
00:17:12,947 --> 00:17:15,865
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

238
00:17:15,950 --> 00:17:18,034
This place ain't so bad.

239
00:17:18,118 --> 00:17:19,744
I tell you what.

240
00:17:20,913 --> 00:17:24,082
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

241
00:17:24,166 --> 00:17:26,751
I know a couple of big old bull queers

242
00:17:26,836 --> 00:17:29,796
that would just love to make your acquaintance.

243
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,299
Especially that big, white,
m-mushy butt of yours.

244
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,301
God!

245
00:17:35,386 --> 00:17:36,886
I don't belong here!

246
00:17:36,971 --> 00:17:38,388
MAN: We have a winner!

247
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:40,223
FAT ASS: I wanna go home!

248
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:42,141
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

249
00:17:42,226 --> 00:17:45,395
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

250
00:17:45,479 --> 00:17:49,315
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

251
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,110
FAT ASS: I don't belong here!

252
00:17:52,194 --> 00:17:53,403
ALL: Fresh fish!

253
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,823
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

254
00:17:56,907 --> 00:17:59,909
MAN: I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

255
00:17:59,994 --> 00:18:01,494
(Men chanting) Fresh fish!

256
00:18:01,579 --> 00:18:03,246
(Door opens)

257
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:06,124
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

258
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,918
He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.

259
00:18:09,003 --> 00:18:10,503
With my baton up your ass!

260
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:12,255
FAT ASS: Let me out of here!

261
00:18:12,339 --> 00:18:15,717
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

262
00:18:15,801 --> 00:18:16,968
FAT ASS: Please...

263
00:18:17,052 --> 00:18:19,095
I ain't supposed to be here.

264
00:18:19,179 --> 00:18:20,555
Not me!

265
00:18:20,639 --> 00:18:23,099
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

266
00:18:23,183 --> 00:18:25,476
Shut the fuck up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

267
00:18:25,561 --> 00:18:27,395
(Whispers) Shut up, man. Shut up.

268
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:28,771
There's been a mistake!

269
00:18:28,856 --> 00:18:32,025
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

270
00:18:32,109 --> 00:18:33,192
Open that cell.

271
00:18:33,277 --> 00:18:37,447
MAN: Me neither.
You people run this place like a fucking prison!

272
00:18:44,914 --> 00:18:46,956
HADLEY: Son of a bitch.

273
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,917
(Thuds)

274
00:18:49,001 --> 00:18:51,044
(Whimpering)

275
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:53,212
PRISONER: Take it easy.

276
00:18:58,552 --> 00:19:00,219
(Yelps)

277
00:19:15,986 --> 00:19:19,364
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here
the rest of the night,

278
00:19:19,448 --> 00:19:23,117
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

279
00:19:23,202 --> 00:19:25,286
Every last motherfucker in here.

280
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:32,877
Call the trustees.
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

281
00:19:47,184 --> 00:19:51,896
RED: His first night in the joint,
Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

282
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:54,857
He never made a sound.

283
00:19:57,736 --> 00:19:59,821
(Gate buzzer)

284
00:20:10,374 --> 00:20:13,626
GUARD: Tier 3 North. Clear.

285
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,878
Tier 2 South. Clear.

286
00:20:15,963 --> 00:20:17,839
Tier 3 South. Clear.

287
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:19,882
Tier 1 North...

288
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:22,760
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

289
00:20:22,845 --> 00:20:24,929
Prepare to roll out.

290
00:20:28,308 --> 00:20:30,393
GUARD: Roll out!

291
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:26,074
Are... Are you going to eat that?

292
00:21:26,158 --> 00:21:29,077
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

293
00:21:30,329 --> 00:21:31,370
Do you mind?

294
00:21:38,712 --> 00:21:41,339
Ah...that's nice and ripe.

295
00:21:46,095 --> 00:21:48,179
(Chirps)

296
00:21:52,935 --> 00:21:55,394
Jake says thank you.

297
00:21:55,479 --> 00:21:57,897
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

298
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:04,695
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

299
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,572
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

300
00:22:09,701 --> 00:22:13,621
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

301
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:16,124
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

302
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:18,626
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

303
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:21,504
just like a pretty little chorus line.

304
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:23,673
Yeah, look at that!

305
00:22:23,757 --> 00:22:26,634
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

306
00:22:26,718 --> 00:22:27,760
(Inhales)

307
00:22:27,845 --> 00:22:30,513
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

308
00:22:30,597 --> 00:22:32,682
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

309
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:38,104
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

310
00:22:38,188 --> 00:22:41,399
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine,
though.

311
00:22:41,483 --> 00:22:44,193
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

312
00:22:44,278 --> 00:22:47,280
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes,
instead?

313
00:22:47,364 --> 00:22:49,157
Lucky fuck.

314
00:22:49,241 --> 00:22:50,950
Hey, Tyrell.

315
00:22:51,034 --> 00:22:53,995
You pull infirmary duty this week?

316
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,788
How's that horse of mine doing?

317
00:22:55,873 --> 00:22:57,331
Dead.

318
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:02,795
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

319
00:23:02,796 --> 00:23:05,548
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

320
00:23:05,632 --> 00:23:08,467
By then, hell, there weren't nothing we could do.

321
00:23:14,266 --> 00:23:15,850
What was his name?

322
00:23:19,104 --> 00:23:20,479
What did you say?

323
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:24,734
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

324
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:27,528
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

325
00:23:28,989 --> 00:23:32,366
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was.
He's dead.

326
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,055
Hey...

327
00:23:54,139 --> 00:23:56,891
Anybody come at you yet?

328
00:23:58,393 --> 00:24:00,394
Anybody get to you yet?

329
00:24:01,521 --> 00:24:04,565
Hey, we all need friends in here.

330
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,567
I could be a friend to you.

331
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:10,696
Hey...

332
00:24:15,535 --> 00:24:17,411
Hard to get.

333
00:24:19,081 --> 00:24:20,748
I like that.

334
00:24:27,381 --> 00:24:30,675
RED: Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

335
00:24:30,759 --> 00:24:33,219
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

336
00:24:33,303 --> 00:24:35,513
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

337
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:39,767
It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth

338
00:24:39,851 --> 00:24:42,144
to say more than two words to somebody.

339
00:24:44,064 --> 00:24:46,107
As it turned out...

340
00:24:46,191 --> 00:24:48,109
that somebody was me.

341
00:24:51,697 --> 00:24:55,866
TANNOY: Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.

342
00:24:56,910 --> 00:24:59,662
I'm Andy Dufresne.

343
00:24:59,746 --> 00:25:01,831
The wife-killing banker.

344
00:25:03,667 --> 00:25:05,376
Why did you do it?

345
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,086
I didn't, since you ask.

346
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:10,214
(Laughs) You're gonna fit right in!

347
00:25:10,299 --> 00:25:13,467
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

348
00:25:13,552 --> 00:25:16,887
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

349
00:25:19,808 --> 00:25:22,601
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

350
00:25:22,686 --> 00:25:26,439
You think your shit smells sweeter than most.
Is that right?

351
00:25:26,523 --> 00:25:28,858
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

352
00:25:28,942 --> 00:25:32,028
I haven't made up my mind. (Chuckles)

353
00:25:32,112 --> 00:25:36,198
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

354
00:25:36,283 --> 00:25:39,785
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

355
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:42,872
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

356
00:25:42,956 --> 00:25:44,332
A rock hammer.

357
00:25:44,416 --> 00:25:46,709
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

358
00:25:48,587 --> 00:25:51,464
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I'd just quote a price,

359
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:54,133
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.

360
00:25:55,552 --> 00:25:57,261
Fair enough.

361
00:25:57,346 --> 00:25:59,805
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

362
00:25:59,890 --> 00:26:01,515
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

363
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,725
Pickaxe?

364
00:26:02,809 --> 00:26:04,894
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

365
00:26:06,563 --> 00:26:08,731
Quartz?

366
00:26:08,815 --> 00:26:10,483
Quartz.

367
00:26:11,735 --> 00:26:14,111
And some mica.

368
00:26:14,196 --> 00:26:15,363
Shale.

369
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:18,032
Limestone.

370
00:26:18,116 --> 00:26:20,034
So?

371
00:26:20,118 --> 00:26:22,203
So, I'm a rock hound.

372
00:26:22,287 --> 00:26:25,498
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

373
00:26:25,582 --> 00:26:27,708
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

374
00:26:27,793 --> 00:26:29,251
No, sir.

375
00:26:30,379 --> 00:26:31,962
I have no enemies here.

376
00:26:32,047 --> 00:26:34,423
No? Wait a while.

377
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:38,135
Word gets around.

378
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:41,347
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

379
00:26:41,431 --> 00:26:43,224
Especially Bogs.

380
00:26:44,309 --> 00:26:48,521
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

381
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:50,106
RED: Neither are they.

382
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:52,900
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

383
00:26:58,156 --> 00:27:02,701
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

384
00:27:02,786 --> 00:27:06,414
If I were you,
I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

385
00:27:06,498 --> 00:27:07,832
Thanks for the advice.

386
00:27:07,916 --> 00:27:09,500
Well, that's free.

387
00:27:09,584 --> 00:27:11,836
You understand my concern.

388
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:14,463
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

389
00:27:14,548 --> 00:27:18,759
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

390
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:22,012
Did I miss something? What's funny?

391
00:27:22,097 --> 00:27:25,141
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

392
00:27:27,018 --> 00:27:29,019
What's an item like this usually go for?

393
00:27:29,104 --> 00:27:32,148
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

394
00:27:32,232 --> 00:27:34,942
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

395
00:27:34,943 --> 00:27:37,486
But this is a specialty item.

396
00:27:37,571 --> 00:27:40,156
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

397
00:27:40,157 --> 00:27:42,116
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

398
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,076
Ten it is.

399
00:27:45,162 --> 00:27:47,580
Waste of money, if you ask me.

400
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:49,206
Why's that?

401
00:27:50,292 --> 00:27:53,335
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

402
00:27:54,921 --> 00:27:57,214
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

403
00:27:57,299 --> 00:27:59,425
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

404
00:27:59,509 --> 00:28:01,719
Mention my name, we never do business again.

405
00:28:01,803 --> 00:28:04,930
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

406
00:28:06,433 --> 00:28:07,850
I understand.

407
00:28:07,934 --> 00:28:09,351
Thank you...

408
00:28:09,352 --> 00:28:10,978
Mr. er...?

409
00:28:11,062 --> 00:28:13,522
Red. The name's Red.

410
00:28:13,523 --> 00:28:14,565
Red?

411
00:28:14,649 --> 00:28:17,401
Why do they call you that?

412
00:28:21,072 --> 00:28:23,157
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

413
00:28:31,124 --> 00:28:34,168
RED: I could see
why some of the boys took him for snobby.

414
00:28:34,252 --> 00:28:37,671
He had a quiet way about him.

415
00:28:37,756 --> 00:28:42,218
A walk and a talk
that just wasn't normal around here.

416
00:28:42,302 --> 00:28:43,844
He strolled...

417
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:48,265
like a man in a park,
without a care or worry in the world.

418
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:53,062
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

419
00:28:53,146 --> 00:28:57,316
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

420
00:28:57,317 --> 00:28:59,401
I liked Andy from the start.

421
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:04,365
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

422
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:09,745
Move it! Come on. Move it!

423
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:16,502
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

424
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:27,680
Easy.

425
00:29:27,764 --> 00:29:29,848
Keep it moving.

426
00:29:32,644 --> 00:29:33,894
Red...

427
00:29:54,416 --> 00:29:58,627
RED: Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

428
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:03,215
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

429
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:08,679
Book?

430
00:30:08,763 --> 00:30:10,639
Not today.

431
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:18,063
- Book?
- No.

432
00:30:19,858 --> 00:30:21,066
Hey, Brooksy.

433
00:30:24,362 --> 00:30:26,447
Delivery for Dufresne.

434
00:30:33,538 --> 00:30:39,168
Book?

435
00:30:42,172 --> 00:30:44,298
Dufresne...

436
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:46,550
Here's your book.

437
00:30:50,972 --> 00:30:52,640
Thanks.

438
00:30:56,478 --> 00:30:59,688
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

439
00:30:59,773 --> 00:31:01,857
Get on back and fetch us up some.

440
00:31:39,062 --> 00:31:41,021
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

441
00:31:41,106 --> 00:31:43,857
Honey...hush.

442
00:31:50,949 --> 00:31:52,825
(Groans)

443
00:31:55,912 --> 00:31:58,330
That's it. You fight.

444
00:31:58,415 --> 00:31:59,998
It's better that way.

445
00:32:00,083 --> 00:32:01,875
(Screaming and yelling)

446
00:32:08,425 --> 00:32:11,260
RED: I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

447
00:32:11,344 --> 00:32:13,887
and the Sisters let him be.

448
00:32:13,972 --> 00:32:15,973
I wish I could tell you that.

449
00:32:16,057 --> 00:32:18,142
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

450
00:32:20,103 --> 00:32:22,229
He never said who did it.

451
00:32:22,313 --> 00:32:25,357
But we all knew.

452
00:32:25,442 --> 00:32:27,317
(Gate buzzer)

453
00:32:28,695 --> 00:32:31,572
Things went on like that for a while.

454
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:34,283
Prison life consists of routine...

455
00:32:34,367 --> 00:32:36,577
and then more routine.

456
00:32:38,955 --> 00:32:42,791
Every so often,
Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

457
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,003
The Sisters kept at him.

458
00:32:46,087 --> 00:32:50,215
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.
Sometimes not.

459
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:53,552
And that's how it went for Andy.

460
00:32:53,636 --> 00:32:56,180
That was his routine.

461
00:32:56,264 --> 00:33:00,058
I do believe
those first two years were the worst for him.

462
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:02,394
And I also believe,

463
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:07,024
if things had gone on that way,
this place would have got the best of him.

464
00:33:07,108 --> 00:33:10,068
But then, in the spring of 1949,

465
00:33:10,153 --> 00:33:12,154
the powers that be decided that...

466
00:33:12,238 --> 00:33:15,657
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

467
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:18,494
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

468
00:33:19,662 --> 00:33:21,789
As you know,

469
00:33:21,873 --> 00:33:25,584
special detail carries with it special privileges.

470
00:33:25,668 --> 00:33:27,753
RED: It was outdoor detail...

471
00:33:29,255 --> 00:33:32,841
..and May is one damn fine month
to be working outdoors.

472
00:33:32,926 --> 00:33:34,551
Stay in line there.

473
00:33:34,636 --> 00:33:37,554
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

474
00:33:39,057 --> 00:33:40,724
(Whispers)

475
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:44,228
Wallace E Unger.

476
00:33:45,396 --> 00:33:47,856
Ellis Redding.

477
00:33:47,941 --> 00:33:50,776
Wouldn't you know it?

478
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,445
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names.

479
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,614
GUARD: Andrew Dufresne.

480
00:33:55,698 --> 00:33:59,243
RED: It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

481
00:33:59,327 --> 00:34:02,037
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

482
00:34:02,121 --> 00:34:05,707
HADLEY: So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

483
00:34:05,792 --> 00:34:07,501
I say, "Yeah?"

484
00:34:07,585 --> 00:34:11,296
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

485
00:34:11,381 --> 00:34:13,882
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

486
00:34:13,967 --> 00:34:15,342
I'm not. He was an asshole.

487
00:34:15,426 --> 00:34:17,761
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

488
00:34:17,846 --> 00:34:21,807
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

489
00:34:21,891 --> 00:34:24,601
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

490
00:34:24,686 --> 00:34:27,145
GUARD: A million bucks?

491
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,606
Fucking incredible
how lucky some assholes get.

492
00:34:29,691 --> 00:34:32,234
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

493
00:34:32,318 --> 00:34:35,404
35,000. That's what he left me.

494
00:34:35,488 --> 00:34:37,406
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

495
00:34:37,490 --> 00:34:40,617
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

496
00:34:40,702 --> 00:34:41,910
Isn’t it?

497
00:34:41,995 --> 00:34:45,038
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

498
00:34:45,123 --> 00:34:47,666
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

499
00:34:47,667 --> 00:34:51,837
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

500
00:34:51,921 --> 00:34:54,590
RED: Crying shame.

501
00:34:54,674 --> 00:34:56,341
Some people really got it awful!

502
00:34:56,426 --> 00:34:57,968
Andy, are you nuts?

503
00:34:58,052 --> 00:35:00,178
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

504
00:35:00,179 --> 00:35:03,223
GUARD: Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

505
00:35:03,308 --> 00:35:06,143
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

506
00:35:06,227 --> 00:35:08,604
I've got to pay tax on the car.

507
00:35:08,688 --> 00:35:12,566
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids
pestering me to take them for a ride...

508
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,570
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

509
00:35:16,654 --> 00:35:18,822
I tell you...Uncle Sam!

510
00:35:18,907 --> 00:35:22,659
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

511
00:35:22,744 --> 00:35:25,454
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

512
00:35:25,538 --> 00:35:27,873
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

513
00:35:27,957 --> 00:35:31,043
Some brother! Shit. (Spits)

514
00:35:31,127 --> 00:35:32,169
Hey!

515
00:35:35,506 --> 00:35:37,716
Mr. Hadley...

516
00:35:37,717 --> 00:35:39,176
do you trust your wife?

517
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,471
Oh, that's funny.

518
00:35:42,555 --> 00:35:45,432
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

519
00:35:45,516 --> 00:35:48,977
I mean, do you think
she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

520
00:35:50,063 --> 00:35:51,939
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

521
00:35:52,023 --> 00:35:53,523
This fucker's having an accident.

522
00:35:53,608 --> 00:35:54,775
He's gonna push him off.

523
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:58,987
Cos if you do trust her,
there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

524
00:35:59,072 --> 00:36:00,948
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

525
00:36:01,032 --> 00:36:02,741
- 35,000?
- All of it.

526
00:36:02,742 --> 00:36:05,077
- All of it?
- Every penny.

527
00:36:05,161 --> 00:36:06,995
You'd better start making sense.

528
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:09,414
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

529
00:36:09,499 --> 00:36:13,627
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

530
00:36:13,711 --> 00:36:15,253
Bullshit! Tax-free?

531
00:36:15,254 --> 00:36:18,423
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

532
00:36:18,508 --> 00:36:21,093
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

533
00:36:21,177 --> 00:36:24,721
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

534
00:36:24,806 --> 00:36:26,306
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

535
00:36:26,391 --> 00:36:29,601
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

536
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,979
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

537
00:36:32,063 --> 00:36:36,149
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

538
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:39,277
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

539
00:36:39,362 --> 00:36:41,238
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

540
00:36:41,322 --> 00:36:43,657
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

541
00:36:43,741 --> 00:36:47,577
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

542
00:36:47,578 --> 00:36:49,955
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

543
00:36:50,039 --> 00:36:51,915
Nearly free of charge.

544
00:36:53,001 --> 00:36:56,378
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

545
00:36:56,462 --> 00:36:58,880
GUARD:
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

546
00:36:58,965 --> 00:37:02,426
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man

547
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,261
if he can have a bottle of suds.

548
00:37:04,345 --> 00:37:07,389
That's only my opinion...sir.

549
00:37:10,810 --> 00:37:12,352
What are you jimmies staring at?

550
00:37:12,437 --> 00:37:13,437
Back to work!

551
00:37:13,521 --> 00:37:15,480
GUARD: Let's go. Work.

552
00:37:23,865 --> 00:37:29,369
RED: And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

553
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:34,124
the convict crew that tarred the plate-factory roof
in the spring of '49...

554
00:37:34,208 --> 00:37:37,419
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

555
00:37:37,503 --> 00:37:41,381
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

556
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:46,678
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

557
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:48,847
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

558
00:37:50,224 --> 00:37:54,394
The colossal prick
even managed to sound magnanimous.

559
00:37:56,147 --> 00:38:00,776
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders,
and felt like free men.

560
00:38:00,860 --> 00:38:04,362
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

561
00:38:04,447 --> 00:38:07,741
We were the lords of all creation.

562
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:12,370
As for Andy,
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

563
00:38:12,455 --> 00:38:15,165
a strange little smile on his face,

564
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:17,334
watching us drink his beer.

565
00:38:24,092 --> 00:38:25,634
Hey...

566
00:38:25,718 --> 00:38:27,010
Want a cold one, Andy?

567
00:38:27,095 --> 00:38:28,762
No, thanks.

568
00:38:28,846 --> 00:38:30,639
I gave up drinking.

569
00:38:34,477 --> 00:38:37,646
RED: You could argue
he'd done it to curry favor with the guards.

570
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:40,565
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

571
00:38:42,819 --> 00:38:46,279
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

572
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:49,449
If only for a short while.

573
00:38:52,328 --> 00:38:54,663
RED: King me.

574
00:38:54,747 --> 00:38:57,165
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

575
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,793
- What?
- Civilized, strategic.

576
00:38:59,877 --> 00:39:02,212
And a total fucking mystery.

577
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:03,505
I hate it.

578
00:39:03,589 --> 00:39:05,507
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

579
00:39:05,591 --> 00:39:08,051
(Chuckles) Yeah. Sure.

580
00:39:08,136 --> 00:39:10,262
I thought of getting a board together.

581
00:39:10,346 --> 00:39:13,140
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

582
00:39:13,224 --> 00:39:14,724
We might do business on a board.

583
00:39:14,809 --> 00:39:17,602
But I want to carve the pieces myself.

584
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:21,273
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

585
00:39:21,357 --> 00:39:23,275
I think it'll take years.

586
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:25,944
Well, years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

587
00:39:26,028 --> 00:39:28,196
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

588
00:39:28,281 --> 00:39:30,240
Pebbles, mostly.

589
00:39:34,579 --> 00:39:37,455
Andy, we're getting to be kinda friends,
aren't we?

590
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:39,207
Yeah, I guess.

591
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:42,752
Can I ask you something?

592
00:39:42,837 --> 00:39:44,838
Why did you do it?

593
00:39:46,048 --> 00:39:49,926
I'm innocent, Red. Just like everybody else here.

594
00:39:54,223 --> 00:39:56,308
What are you in for?

595
00:39:58,311 --> 00:39:59,311
Murder.

596
00:39:59,395 --> 00:40:00,812
Same as you.

597
00:40:00,897 --> 00:40:02,063
Innocent?

598
00:40:04,734 --> 00:40:06,818
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

599
00:41:06,295 --> 00:41:07,879
Where's the canary?

600
00:41:07,964 --> 00:41:09,297
How did you know?

601
00:41:09,298 --> 00:41:10,465
How did I know what?

602
00:41:10,549 --> 00:41:12,968
So, you don't know? Come.

603
00:41:15,721 --> 00:41:17,847
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

604
00:41:17,932 --> 00:41:20,141
(Woman singing)

605
00:41:20,226 --> 00:41:24,229
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing
in my house, eh, Johnny?

606
00:41:27,149 --> 00:41:29,526
That's quite a...

607
00:41:29,610 --> 00:41:31,278
surprise.

608
00:41:33,781 --> 00:41:35,490
Red...

609
00:41:35,574 --> 00:41:37,367
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

610
00:41:37,451 --> 00:41:39,286
Here she comes.

611
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:42,247
This is the part I like -
when she does that shit with her hair.

612
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:45,250
Yeah, I know. I've seen it three times this month.

613
00:41:45,334 --> 00:41:47,335
Gilda, are you decent?

614
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,462
Me?

615
00:41:49,547 --> 00:41:51,089
(Men howl)

616
00:41:51,173 --> 00:41:53,216
Hah! God, I love it!

617
00:41:53,301 --> 00:41:55,385
(Men cheer and whistle)

618
00:41:59,098 --> 00:42:02,892
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

619
00:42:02,977 --> 00:42:06,855
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

620
00:42:06,939 --> 00:42:09,441
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

621
00:42:09,525 --> 00:42:11,359
Can you get her?

622
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:15,905
So, this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you, Johnny.

623
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:17,866
Take a few weeks.

624
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,159
Weeks?

625
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:24,414
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffed down
the front of my pants right now, I'm sorry to say.

626
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:27,000
But I'll get her. Relax.

627
00:42:29,253 --> 00:42:30,754
Thanks.

628
00:42:30,838 --> 00:42:32,839
- It was a surprise, Mr. Farrell.
- It was.

629
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:33,965
MEN: Sit down.

630
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,967
Did you tell him what I'm doing here?

631
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:38,887
No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.

632
00:42:38,971 --> 00:42:40,638
Hang on to your hat, Mr. Farrell...

633
00:42:44,185 --> 00:42:45,894
(Grunts)

634
00:42:50,733 --> 00:42:52,984
- Take a walk.
- I gotta change the reel.

635
00:42:53,069 --> 00:42:55,153
I said fuck off!

636
00:42:57,448 --> 00:42:59,908
(Door closes as film dialogue continues)

637
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:02,786
Ain't you gonna scream?

638
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:05,955
Let's get this over with.

639
00:43:10,086 --> 00:43:11,711
He broke my fuckin' nose!

640
00:43:22,223 --> 00:43:26,267
Now...I'm gonna open my fly...

641
00:43:26,352 --> 00:43:29,312
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

642
00:43:30,398 --> 00:43:32,190
Then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

643
00:43:32,274 --> 00:43:35,110
You broke his nose,
he ought to have something to show for it.

644
00:43:35,194 --> 00:43:37,404
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

645
00:43:37,488 --> 00:43:40,240
No. You don't understand.

646
00:43:40,324 --> 00:43:43,618
You do that, and I'll put
all eight inches of this steel in your ear.

647
00:43:43,619 --> 00:43:44,702
All right.

648
00:43:44,787 --> 00:43:49,416
But you should know that sudden, serious
brain injury causes the victim to bite down hard.

649
00:43:50,668 --> 00:43:53,086
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

650
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:57,966
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
with a crowbar.

651
00:44:00,803 --> 00:44:02,429
Where did you get this shit?

652
00:44:02,513 --> 00:44:04,180
I read it.

653
00:44:05,266 --> 00:44:08,143
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

654
00:44:09,645 --> 00:44:11,521
Honey...

655
00:44:12,773 --> 00:44:15,150
..you shouldn't.

656
00:44:15,234 --> 00:44:17,110
(Groans)

657
00:44:17,194 --> 00:44:20,196
RED: Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth...

658
00:44:20,281 --> 00:44:22,657
and neither did his friends.

659
00:44:22,741 --> 00:44:26,035
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

660
00:44:27,246 --> 00:44:29,247
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

661
00:44:30,291 --> 00:44:32,792
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

662
00:44:37,256 --> 00:44:38,882
Time's up, Bogs.

663
00:44:42,553 --> 00:44:44,637
It's your world, boss.

664
00:44:46,724 --> 00:44:50,143
TANNOY:
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

665
00:44:50,227 --> 00:44:52,395
All prisoners report for lockdown.

666
00:45:07,953 --> 00:45:09,245
What?

667
00:45:11,916 --> 00:45:13,666
(Gasps)

668
00:45:15,878 --> 00:45:17,962
(Bogs cries in pain)

669
00:45:21,717 --> 00:45:24,427
GUARD: Where's he going?
HADLEY: Grab his ankles.

670
00:45:26,013 --> 00:45:28,515
No! No!

671
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:29,974
No!

672
00:45:30,059 --> 00:45:31,392
Help me...

673
00:45:31,477 --> 00:45:32,769
Aaarghh!

674
00:45:32,853 --> 00:45:34,979
(Punching and screaming)

675
00:45:35,064 --> 00:45:37,732
RED:
Two things never happened again after that.

676
00:45:37,816 --> 00:45:40,652
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again...

677
00:45:41,862 --> 00:45:44,572
..and Bogs never walked again.

678
00:45:45,699 --> 00:45:49,118
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

679
00:45:49,203 --> 00:45:54,916
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest
of his days drinking his food through a straw.

680
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:59,671
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

681
00:46:00,798 --> 00:46:04,592
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

682
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:08,638
The man likes to play chess.

683
00:46:08,722 --> 00:46:10,807
Let's get him some rocks.

684
00:46:43,215 --> 00:46:45,091
Guys...

685
00:46:45,175 --> 00:46:47,552
I got one. I got one. Look.

686
00:46:49,972 --> 00:46:52,056
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

687
00:46:52,141 --> 00:46:54,350
And it ain't alabaster, either.

688
00:46:54,435 --> 00:46:56,060
What are you, a fucking geologist?

689
00:46:56,145 --> 00:46:58,187
He's right. It ain't.

690
00:46:58,272 --> 00:46:59,522
Well, what the hell is it?

691
00:46:59,607 --> 00:47:02,150
RED: A horse apple.

692
00:47:02,234 --> 00:47:05,361
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

693
00:47:05,446 --> 00:47:07,530
(Horse whinnies)

694
00:47:11,744 --> 00:47:14,621
- Oh, Jesus Christ!
(Men laugh)

695
00:47:14,705 --> 00:47:16,664
Oh, damn!

696
00:47:16,749 --> 00:47:20,710
RED: Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

697
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:24,547
And by the weekend he was due back,
we had enough rocks

698
00:47:24,632 --> 00:47:27,675
to keep him busy till rapture.

699
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:30,470
I also got a big shipment in that week.

700
00:47:30,554 --> 00:47:33,097
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

701
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:34,682
Sipping whisky.

702
00:47:34,767 --> 00:47:38,311
Playing cards with naked ladies on them.
You name it.

703
00:47:38,395 --> 00:47:41,356
And of course, the most important item.

704
00:47:43,108 --> 00:47:45,193
Rita Hayworth herself.

705
00:48:19,353 --> 00:48:22,188
GUARD: OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

706
00:48:22,272 --> 00:48:24,607
(Furtively) Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

707
00:48:24,692 --> 00:48:26,943
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

708
00:48:29,071 --> 00:48:30,947
119.

709
00:48:32,449 --> 00:48:34,117
123.

710
00:48:35,202 --> 00:48:37,286
(Guards calling out)

711
00:48:43,585 --> 00:48:45,461
On your feet.

712
00:48:47,172 --> 00:48:49,048
Face the wall.

713
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,626
HADLEY: Turn around and face the Warden.

714
00:49:31,341 --> 00:49:33,426
Pleased to see you reading this.

715
00:49:34,803 --> 00:49:37,096
Any favorite passages?

716
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:43,269
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

717
00:49:44,313 --> 00:49:47,190
Mark 13:35.

718
00:49:47,274 --> 00:49:49,942
I always liked that one.

719
00:49:50,027 --> 00:49:51,527
But I prefer...

720
00:49:51,612 --> 00:49:54,363
"I'm the light of the world.

721
00:49:54,448 --> 00:49:57,992
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life."

722
00:49:58,076 --> 00:50:00,661
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

723
00:50:00,746 --> 00:50:04,207
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

724
00:50:05,334 --> 00:50:07,418
A man should have a skill.

725
00:50:09,505 --> 00:50:10,963
Wanna explain this?

726
00:50:12,049 --> 00:50:15,510
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

727
00:50:16,553 --> 00:50:18,513
A little hobby of mine.

728
00:50:26,939 --> 00:50:29,273
(Inhales)

729
00:50:29,358 --> 00:50:32,360
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,

730
00:50:32,444 --> 00:50:34,529
but nothing to get in a twist over.

731
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:40,451
I can't say I approve of this.

732
00:50:41,954 --> 00:50:43,663
But I suppose...

733
00:50:45,624 --> 00:50:47,500
..exceptions can be made.

734
00:50:57,886 --> 00:51:00,179
HADLEY: Lock 'em up!

735
00:51:02,182 --> 00:51:04,141
I almost forgot.

736
00:51:04,226 --> 00:51:06,477
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

737
00:51:06,562 --> 00:51:08,020
Salvation lies within.

738
00:51:09,106 --> 00:51:10,439
Yes, sir.

739
00:51:18,740 --> 00:51:21,325
RED: Tossing cells was just an excuse.

740
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:25,454
The truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.

741
00:51:39,094 --> 00:51:42,221
My wife made that in church group.

742
00:51:44,558 --> 00:51:45,892
Very nice, sir.

743
00:51:47,060 --> 00:51:48,936
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

744
00:51:50,564 --> 00:51:52,273
No, sir, not especially.

745
00:51:52,357 --> 00:51:55,151
Perhaps we can find something more...

746
00:51:55,235 --> 00:51:57,320
befitting a man of your education.

747
00:52:01,658 --> 00:52:03,534
(Bird screeches)

748
00:52:05,662 --> 00:52:07,330
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

749
00:52:07,414 --> 00:52:08,706
Andy.

750
00:52:08,790 --> 00:52:11,083
I thought I heard you out here!

751
00:52:12,586 --> 00:52:14,170
I've been reassigned to you.

752
00:52:14,254 --> 00:52:17,423
I know. They told me. (Chuckles)

753
00:52:17,507 --> 00:52:19,592
Ain't that a kick in the head?

754
00:52:19,676 --> 00:52:22,178
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

755
00:52:22,262 --> 00:52:24,347
Come on.

756
00:52:24,431 --> 00:52:26,599
Well, here she is.

757
00:52:26,683 --> 00:52:29,226
Shawshank Prison library.

758
00:52:29,311 --> 00:52:32,188
National Geographics.

759
00:52:32,272 --> 00:52:35,107
Reader's Digest condensed books.

760
00:52:35,192 --> 00:52:37,485
Louis L'Amour.

761
00:52:37,486 --> 00:52:39,612
Look Magazine.

762
00:52:39,696 --> 00:52:42,198
Erle Stanley Gardners.

763
00:52:42,282 --> 00:52:45,826
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

764
00:52:45,827 --> 00:52:48,996
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

765
00:52:49,081 --> 00:52:52,541
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

766
00:52:52,626 --> 00:52:55,586
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

767
00:52:55,671 --> 00:53:00,841
Oh...I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

768
00:53:00,926 --> 00:53:04,303
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

769
00:53:04,388 --> 00:53:06,973
No. No, not much to it, really.

770
00:53:07,057 --> 00:53:08,975
Well, why me? Why now?

771
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:10,559
I don't know,

772
00:53:10,644 --> 00:53:13,980
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

773
00:53:13,981 --> 00:53:16,065
HADLEY: Dufresne!

774
00:53:25,367 --> 00:53:27,451
That's him. That's the one.

775
00:53:35,002 --> 00:53:36,293
I'm Dekins.

776
00:53:36,378 --> 00:53:38,838
(Nervously) I was er...

777
00:53:38,922 --> 00:53:42,925
thinking about maybe setting up
some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

778
00:53:45,262 --> 00:53:46,721
Oh...

779
00:53:46,805 --> 00:53:48,472
I see.

780
00:53:49,933 --> 00:53:51,809
Well, erm...

781
00:53:53,186 --> 00:53:54,729
..why don't we have a seat,

782
00:53:54,813 --> 00:53:56,897
and talk it over?

783
00:53:59,443 --> 00:54:02,361
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

784
00:54:13,832 --> 00:54:15,541
Thanks.

785
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:17,293
So...

786
00:54:18,545 --> 00:54:21,047
Mr. Dekins...

787
00:54:21,131 --> 00:54:25,593
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

788
00:54:25,677 --> 00:54:27,803
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

789
00:54:27,888 --> 00:54:30,556
As God is my witness, he did!

790
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,018
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

791
00:54:34,102 --> 00:54:35,978
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

792
00:54:36,063 --> 00:54:37,438
My ass!

793
00:54:37,522 --> 00:54:38,731
Shook his hand.

794
00:54:38,815 --> 00:54:41,776
Hell, I...I near soiled myself! (Laughs)

795
00:54:41,860 --> 00:54:46,072
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

796
00:54:46,156 --> 00:54:47,490
and he would have been:

797
00:54:47,574 --> 00:54:49,116
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

798
00:54:49,201 --> 00:54:50,951
Making a few friends, Andy?

799
00:54:51,995 --> 00:54:53,954
I wouldn't say "friends".

800
00:54:54,039 --> 00:54:58,042
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

801
00:54:58,126 --> 00:55:00,461
It's a wonderful pet to have.

802
00:55:00,545 --> 00:55:02,463
Got you out of the laundry, though.

803
00:55:02,547 --> 00:55:04,757
Well, it might do more than that.

804
00:55:04,841 --> 00:55:07,843
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

805
00:55:07,928 --> 00:55:10,638
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

806
00:55:10,722 --> 00:55:13,182
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

807
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:18,521
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

808
00:55:18,605 --> 00:55:20,356
Ask the Warden for funds.

809
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:21,690
(Laughter)

810
00:55:21,775 --> 00:55:25,069
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

811
00:55:25,153 --> 00:55:28,781
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

812
00:55:28,865 --> 00:55:30,574
Not one of them born...

813
00:55:30,575 --> 00:55:35,538
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

814
00:55:35,622 --> 00:55:37,915
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

815
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:39,250
I see.

816
00:55:39,334 --> 00:55:42,878
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

817
00:55:42,963 --> 00:55:47,341
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

818
00:55:47,425 --> 00:55:49,510
more walls, more bars and more guards.

819
00:55:49,594 --> 00:55:54,014
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

820
00:55:54,099 --> 00:55:55,641
Sure can.

821
00:55:55,725 --> 00:55:58,602
But you write your letters, if it makes you happy.

822
00:55:58,687 --> 00:56:00,980
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

823
00:56:02,899 --> 00:56:05,943
RED: So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

824
00:56:06,027 --> 00:56:08,112
just like he said.

825
00:56:12,159 --> 00:56:16,287
And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.

826
00:56:24,129 --> 00:56:29,633
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

827
00:56:29,718 --> 00:56:32,803
The year after that, he did them all...

828
00:56:32,888 --> 00:56:34,972
including the Warden's.

829
00:56:36,349 --> 00:56:40,102
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

830
00:56:40,187 --> 00:56:42,271
to coincide with tax season.

831
00:56:44,566 --> 00:56:48,777
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

832
00:56:48,862 --> 00:56:52,990
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

833
00:56:53,074 --> 00:56:54,825
Damn right. The holster, too.

834
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:56,160
That's tax-deductible.

835
00:56:56,244 --> 00:56:57,411
You can write that off.

836
00:56:57,495 --> 00:57:00,831
RED: Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

837
00:57:00,916 --> 00:57:03,959
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

838
00:57:04,044 --> 00:57:06,086
he was allowed a staff.

839
00:57:06,171 --> 00:57:08,631
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

840
00:57:08,715 --> 00:57:11,383
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

841
00:57:11,468 --> 00:57:14,136
and that was fine by me.

842
00:57:14,221 --> 00:57:17,598
And still...he kept sending those letters.

843
00:57:22,896 --> 00:57:24,730
Red, Andy.

844
00:57:24,814 --> 00:57:26,023
It's Brooks.

845
00:57:26,107 --> 00:57:28,567
(Men shouting)
- Watch the door.

846
00:57:28,652 --> 00:57:30,236
Please, Brooks.

847
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,321
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

848
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:34,448
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

849
00:57:34,532 --> 00:57:37,618
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

850
00:57:37,702 --> 00:57:40,162
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

851
00:57:40,247 --> 00:57:42,373
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

852
00:57:42,457 --> 00:57:44,166
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

853
00:57:44,251 --> 00:57:46,126
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

854
00:57:46,211 --> 00:57:48,337
It's what they done!

855
00:57:48,421 --> 00:57:49,838
I...I got no choice...

856
00:57:49,923 --> 00:57:52,591
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

857
00:57:52,676 --> 00:57:55,302
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

858
00:57:55,387 --> 00:57:58,806
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

859
00:57:58,890 --> 00:58:00,182
That's right. Right, guys?

860
00:58:00,267 --> 00:58:03,644
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

861
00:58:03,728 --> 00:58:05,562
Put the knife down.

862
00:58:06,648 --> 00:58:07,815
Brooks...

863
00:58:07,899 --> 00:58:10,150
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

864
00:58:10,235 --> 00:58:12,569
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

865
00:58:12,654 --> 00:58:13,821
(Heywood gasps)

866
00:58:13,905 --> 00:58:15,489
It's the only...

867
00:58:15,573 --> 00:58:17,866
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

868
00:58:17,951 --> 00:58:20,536
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

869
00:58:20,537 --> 00:58:22,621
Put it down.

870
00:58:23,957 --> 00:58:26,333
(Brooks sobs)

871
00:58:30,005 --> 00:58:34,717
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

872
00:58:34,801 --> 00:58:36,176
HEYWOOD: Him?

873
00:58:36,261 --> 00:58:39,930
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

874
00:58:40,015 --> 00:58:42,641
RED: Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

875
00:58:42,726 --> 00:58:44,977
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

876
00:58:45,061 --> 00:58:47,396
Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

877
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,607
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

878
00:58:52,652 --> 00:58:55,779
I just don't understand what happened in there.
That's all.

879
00:58:55,864 --> 00:58:58,449
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

880
00:58:58,533 --> 00:59:00,743
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

881
00:59:00,827 --> 00:59:03,829
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

882
00:59:03,913 --> 00:59:05,289
Would you knock it off?

883
00:59:05,373 --> 00:59:07,708
Brooks ain't no bug.

884
00:59:07,792 --> 00:59:09,668
He's just...

885
00:59:11,546 --> 00:59:13,380
He's just institutionalized.

886
00:59:14,716 --> 00:59:16,383
Institutionalized, my ass.

887
00:59:16,468 --> 00:59:20,763
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

888
00:59:20,847 --> 00:59:22,556
This is all he knows.

889
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:25,059
In here, he's an important man.

890
00:59:25,143 --> 00:59:26,602
He's an educated man.

891
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:28,771
Outside, he's nothing.

892
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,567
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

893
00:59:33,651 --> 00:59:36,862
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

894
00:59:36,946 --> 00:59:39,031
You know what I'm trying to say?

895
00:59:39,115 --> 00:59:41,867
Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

896
00:59:43,119 --> 00:59:46,038
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

897
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:48,582
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

898
00:59:50,001 --> 00:59:52,086
First you hate 'em...

899
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,714
..then you get used to 'em.

900
00:59:57,342 --> 00:59:59,968
Enough time passes...

901
01:00:00,053 --> 01:00:03,013
you get so you depend on 'em.

902
01:00:03,098 --> 01:00:05,432
That's institutionalized.

903
01:00:05,517 --> 01:00:06,892
JIGGER: Shit.

904
01:00:06,893 --> 01:00:08,519
You can never get like that.

905
01:00:08,603 --> 01:00:10,521
Oh, yeah?

906
01:00:10,605 --> 01:00:13,190
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

907
01:00:13,274 --> 01:00:15,150
Goddamn right.

908
01:00:17,487 --> 01:00:20,030
They send you here for life.

909
01:00:20,115 --> 01:00:22,199
That's exactly what they take.

910
01:00:24,119 --> 01:00:26,203
The part that counts, anyway.

911
01:00:29,249 --> 01:00:32,584
(Jake screeches)

912
01:00:33,711 --> 01:00:35,879
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

913
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:39,633
You go on, now.

914
01:00:40,718 --> 01:00:45,389
You're free.

915
01:01:01,281 --> 01:01:03,157
Bye.

916
01:01:04,242 --> 01:01:06,160
Good luck, Brooks.

917
01:01:42,739 --> 01:01:45,449
BROOKS: Dear fellas...

918
01:01:45,533 --> 01:01:49,745
I can't believe
how fast things move on the outside.

919
01:01:49,829 --> 01:01:51,079
(Horn blares)

920
01:01:51,164 --> 01:01:54,208
Watch it, old-timer! Are you trying to get killed?

921
01:01:54,292 --> 01:01:57,628
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

922
01:01:57,712 --> 01:02:00,631
but now...they're everywhere.

923
01:02:04,844 --> 01:02:08,430
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

924
01:02:24,781 --> 01:02:31,078
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

925
01:02:31,162 --> 01:02:34,957
and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway.

926
01:02:37,001 --> 01:02:42,339
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

927
01:02:42,423 --> 01:02:44,424
WOMAN: Make sure your man double-bags.

928
01:02:44,509 --> 01:02:46,760
Last time, the bottom near came out.

929
01:02:46,844 --> 01:02:50,138
Make sure you double-bag, like the lady says.
Understand?

930
01:02:50,223 --> 01:02:51,682
Yes, sir. I surely will.

931
01:02:51,766 --> 01:02:55,561
BROOKS: I don't think
the store manager likes me very much.

932
01:02:55,645 --> 01:02:57,437
(Pigeons cooing)

933
01:02:58,523 --> 01:03:03,318
Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

934
01:03:03,403 --> 01:03:08,740
I keep thinking Jake might just show up
and say hello.

935
01:03:08,825 --> 01:03:10,617
But he never does.

936
01:03:11,703 --> 01:03:17,082
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

937
01:03:20,587 --> 01:03:23,505
I have trouble sleeping at night.

938
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:26,383
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

939
01:03:27,468 --> 01:03:29,386
I wake up, scared.

940
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,473
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

941
01:03:35,101 --> 01:03:36,560
Maybe I should get me a gun

942
01:03:36,644 --> 01:03:40,522
and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home.

943
01:03:40,607 --> 01:03:42,941
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it.

944
01:03:43,026 --> 01:03:44,985
Sort of like a bonus.

945
01:03:46,487 --> 01:03:50,741
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense
any more.

946
01:03:50,825 --> 01:03:52,868
I don't like it here.

947
01:03:52,952 --> 01:03:55,621
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

948
01:03:55,705 --> 01:03:56,788
I've decided...

949
01:03:56,873 --> 01:03:58,749
not to stay.

950
01:04:10,094 --> 01:04:13,597
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

951
01:04:13,681 --> 01:04:15,766
Not for an old crook like me.

952
01:04:30,615 --> 01:04:32,532
(Scraping)

953
01:05:18,788 --> 01:05:22,833
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.

954
01:05:24,001 --> 01:05:28,046
PS. Tell Heywood
I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

955
01:05:28,047 --> 01:05:30,132
No hard feelings. Brooks."

956
01:05:40,852 --> 01:05:42,936
He should have died in here.

957
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:52,821
HADLEY: What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

958
01:05:57,535 --> 01:05:58,952
What's all this?

959
01:05:59,036 --> 01:06:02,914
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

960
01:06:02,999 --> 01:06:04,291
Take it.

"Dear Mr. Dufresne...

962
01:06:15,928 --> 01:06:17,929
In response to your repeated enquiries,

963
01:06:18,014 --> 01:06:22,726
the State has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project."

964
01:06:22,810 --> 01:06:24,186
This is 200 dollars.

965
01:06:25,229 --> 01:06:29,149
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded

966
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:31,943
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

967
01:06:32,028 --> 01:06:34,112
We trust this will fill your needs.

968
01:06:34,197 --> 01:06:38,325
We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

969
01:06:38,409 --> 01:06:41,244
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

970
01:06:41,329 --> 01:06:42,996
Yes, sir.

971
01:06:46,751 --> 01:06:48,126
Good for you, Andy.

972
01:06:50,755 --> 01:06:52,214
Wow!

973
01:06:53,299 --> 01:06:55,383
It only took six years.

974
01:06:56,677 --> 01:06:59,554
From now on,
I'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

975
01:06:59,639 --> 01:07:03,183
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out,

976
01:07:03,267 --> 01:07:04,434
like the Captain said.

977
01:07:04,519 --> 01:07:08,396
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

978
01:07:14,570 --> 01:07:16,571
Wow.

so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words...

01:09:39,340 --> 01:09:41,716
and makes your heart ache because of it.

I tell you, those voices soared...

1002

higher and farther
than anybody in a grey place dares to dream.

1003

It was like some beautiful bird
flapped into our drab little cage

before I could take requests.

1024

Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?

1025
01:11:17,146 --> 01:11:18,396
Easiest time I ever did.

1026
01:11:18,481 --> 01:11:21,524
Bullshit!
There's no such thing as easy time in the hole.

1027
01:11:21,525 --> 01:11:24,152
A week in the hole is like a year.

1028

I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

So, they let you tote that record player
down there, huh?

1030

01:11:34,205 --> 01:11:35,872
And in here.

1032
01:11:37,083 --> 01:11:41,336
That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

1033
01:11:45,257 --> 01:11:47,759
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

1034
01:11:49,428 --> 01:11:53,515
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

1035
01:11:53,599 --> 01:11:55,391
Lost interest in it, though.

1036
01:11:55,476 --> 01:11:57,310
Didn't make much sense in here.

1037
01:11:57,394 --> 01:11:59,854
Here's where it makes the most sense.

1038
01:11:59,939 --> 01:12:02,524
You need it, so you don't forget.

1039
01:12:02,608 --> 01:12:03,942
Forget?

1040
01:12:04,026 --> 01:12:05,985
Forget that...

1041
01:12:06,070 --> 01:12:08,154
there are places...

1042
01:12:09,490 --> 01:12:12,033
..in the world that aren't made out of stone...

1043
01:12:12,118 --> 01:12:14,160
that there's a...

1044
01:12:14,245 --> 01:12:16,079
there's something...

1045
01:12:16,163 --> 01:12:18,957
inside that they can't get to...

1046
01:12:19,041 --> 01:12:21,334
that they can't touch.

1047
01:12:21,418 --> 01:12:23,294
It's yours.

1048
01:12:24,713 --> 01:12:26,422
What are you talking about?

1049
01:12:27,508 --> 01:12:29,092
Hope.

1050
01:12:29,176 --> 01:12:31,052
Hope?

1051
01:12:32,888 --> 01:12:35,557
Let me tell you something, my friend.

1052
01:12:35,641 --> 01:12:37,600
Hope is a dangerous thing.

1053
01:12:39,186 --> 01:12:41,229
Hope can drive a man insane.

1054
01:12:42,273 --> 01:12:44,190
It's got no use on the inside.

1055
01:12:44,275 --> 01:12:46,943
You'd better get used to that idea.

1056
01:12:49,363 --> 01:12:50,989
Like Brooks did?

1057
01:13:16,223 --> 01:13:17,265
Sit down.

1058
01:13:22,479 --> 01:13:25,940
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

1059
01:13:26,025 --> 01:13:28,651
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1060
01:13:28,736 --> 01:13:30,820
Oh, yes, sir.

1061
01:13:30,821 --> 01:13:32,906
Without a doubt.

1062
01:13:33,949 --> 01:13:36,284
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

1063
01:13:38,871 --> 01:13:40,914
No danger to society here.

1064
01:13:40,998 --> 01:13:43,082
God's honest truth.

1065
01:13:45,419 --> 01:13:47,503
Absolutely rehabilitated.

1066
01:13:57,431 --> 01:13:59,515
30 years.

1067
01:14:00,601 --> 01:14:02,644
Jesus, when they say it like that...

1068
01:14:02,728 --> 01:14:04,812
You wonder where it went.

1069
01:14:07,775 --> 01:14:09,859
I wonder where ten years went.

1070
01:14:14,907 --> 01:14:16,199
Here.

1071
01:14:16,283 --> 01:14:18,451
Little parole rejection present.

1072
01:14:20,287 --> 01:14:22,330
Go ahead and open it.

1073
01:14:22,414 --> 01:14:26,209
I had to go through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind.

1074
01:14:26,293 --> 01:14:28,378
I wanted it to be a surprise.

1075
01:14:38,514 --> 01:14:40,598
It's very pretty, Andy.

1076
01:14:41,684 --> 01:14:43,768
Thank you.

1077
01:14:45,521 --> 01:14:47,605
Are you going to play it?

1078
01:14:51,735 --> 01:14:53,820
No.

1079
01:14:56,115 --> 01:14:58,199
Not right now.

(Hammering)

1093
01:16:28,791 --> 01:16:30,833
RED: Andy was as good as his word.

1094
01:16:30,918 --> 01:16:33,419
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

1095
01:16:36,048 --> 01:16:40,176
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

1096
01:16:40,260 --> 01:16:43,137
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

1097
01:16:43,222 --> 01:16:49,811
Appropriations Committee voted
an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.

1098
01:16:49,895 --> 01:16:51,604
And you'd be amazed

1099
01:16:51,688 --> 01:16:53,356
how far Andy could stretch it.

1100
01:16:53,440 --> 01:16:56,317
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

1101
01:16:56,402 --> 01:16:58,778
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

1102
01:16:58,862 --> 01:17:01,072
Treasure Island.

1103

..Stevenson.

1105
01:17:04,701 --> 01:17:06,160
Fiction, adventure.

1106
01:17:08,163 --> 01:17:09,789
What's next?

1107
01:17:09,790 --> 01:17:12,500
I got here Auto Repair and...

1108
01:17:13,544 --> 01:17:14,877
..Soap Carving.

1109
01:17:14,962 --> 01:17:18,339
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under

1113
01:17:26,849 --> 01:17:31,769
Dumb-ass?

1114
01:17:34,273 --> 01:17:36,607
Dumas. You know what that's about?

1115
01:17:36,692 --> 01:17:38,067
Uh-uh.

1116
01:17:38,152 --> 01:17:40,862
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

1117
01:17:40,946 --> 01:17:44,949
We ought to file that under Educational, too,
oughtn't we?

1118
01:17:45,033 --> 01:17:49,203
RED: The rest of us did our best to pitch in
when and where we could.

1119
01:17:50,456 --> 01:17:52,290
By the year Kennedy was shot,

1120
01:17:52,374 --> 01:17:56,711
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

1121
01:17:56,712 --> 01:18:00,047
into the best prison library in New England,

1122
01:18:00,132 --> 01:18:04,010
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

1123
01:18:04,094 --> 01:18:08,264
♪ Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo

1125
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:15,938
RED: That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out program.

1126
01:18:16,023 --> 01:18:18,733
You may remember reading about it.

1127
01:18:18,817 --> 01:18:22,236
It made all the papers
and got his picture in Look Magazine.

1128
01:18:22,321 --> 01:18:23,988
No free ride.

1129
01:18:24,072 --> 01:18:27,033
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

1130
01:18:27,117 --> 01:18:29,285
in corrections and rehabilitation.

1131
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:32,663
Our inmates, properly supervised,

1132
01:18:32,748 --> 01:18:35,500
will be put to work outside these walls,

1133
01:18:35,584 --> 01:18:37,668
performing all manner of public service.

1134
01:18:37,753 --> 01:18:41,672
These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labor,

1135
01:18:41,757 --> 01:18:45,426
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

1136
01:18:45,511 --> 01:18:50,723
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

1137
01:18:50,807 --> 01:18:53,476
RED: Of course,
Norton failed to mention to the press

1138
01:18:53,560 --> 01:18:56,854
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1139
01:18:56,939 --> 01:19:00,107
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top.

1140
01:19:00,192 --> 01:19:02,818
Men, materials, you name it.

1141
01:19:03,862 --> 01:19:06,614
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

1142
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:08,824
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

1143
01:19:08,909 --> 01:19:11,077
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

1144
01:19:11,161 --> 01:19:13,204
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1145
01:19:13,288 --> 01:19:17,250
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

1146
01:19:17,334 --> 01:19:19,585
Well, that's fine for the papers

1147
01:19:19,670 --> 01:19:21,170
but I've got a family to feed.

1148
01:19:21,255 --> 01:19:22,964
Sam...

1149
01:19:23,048 --> 01:19:25,508
Sam, we go back a long way.

1150
01:19:25,592 --> 01:19:27,927
I need this new highway contract.

1151
01:19:28,011 --> 01:19:30,221
I don't get it, and I go under.

1152
01:19:30,305 --> 01:19:32,348
That's a fact.

1153
01:19:32,432 --> 01:19:34,517
You just have some of this fine pie

1154
01:19:34,601 --> 01:19:36,644
my missus made especially for you,

1155
01:19:36,728 --> 01:19:38,062
and you think about that.

1156
01:19:46,113 --> 01:19:49,031
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1157
01:19:49,116 --> 01:19:52,326
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

1158
01:19:54,204 --> 01:19:56,789
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

1159
01:19:58,417 --> 01:20:00,585
RED: And behind every shady deal,

1160
01:20:00,669 --> 01:20:02,878
behind every dollar earned,

1161
01:20:02,963 --> 01:20:06,132
there was Andy, keeping the books.

1162
01:20:07,175 --> 01:20:10,595
Two deposits.
Maine National and New England First.

1163
01:20:10,679 --> 01:20:12,763
Night drops as always, sir.

1164
01:20:43,170 --> 01:20:44,920
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1165
01:20:45,005 --> 01:20:47,798
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

1166
01:20:47,883 --> 01:20:51,636
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

1167
01:20:51,720 --> 01:20:53,721
How do I look?

1168
01:20:53,805 --> 01:20:56,515
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1169
01:20:56,600 --> 01:20:58,309
The Governor's going to be there.

1170
01:20:59,728 --> 01:21:01,771
Want the rest of this?

1171
01:21:01,855 --> 01:21:03,939
The woman can't bake worth shit.

1172
01:21:05,317 --> 01:21:07,109
Thank you, sir.

1173
01:21:09,279 --> 01:21:13,032
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

1174
01:21:13,116 --> 01:21:15,576
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

1175
01:21:15,661 --> 01:21:17,703
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1176
01:21:17,788 --> 01:21:20,665
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

1177
01:21:20,749 --> 01:21:24,001
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

1178
01:21:24,086 --> 01:21:26,671
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

1179
01:21:26,755 --> 01:21:29,256
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

1180
01:21:29,341 --> 01:21:31,884
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

1181
01:21:31,968 --> 01:21:34,637
I send that money out into the real world.

1182
01:21:34,721 --> 01:21:38,349
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

1183
01:21:38,433 --> 01:21:39,642
Cleaner.

1184
01:21:39,726 --> 01:21:43,354
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1185
01:21:46,108 --> 01:21:50,528
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

1186
01:21:50,612 --> 01:21:53,864
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

1187
01:21:53,949 --> 01:21:57,243
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1188
01:21:57,327 --> 01:22:00,329
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

1189
01:22:00,414 --> 01:22:03,249
it's gonna lead to somebody.

1190
01:22:03,333 --> 01:22:05,292
Sure it is. But not to me.

1191
01:22:05,377 --> 01:22:07,378
And certainly not to the Warden.

1192
01:22:11,425 --> 01:22:12,717
All right. Who?

1193
01:22:12,801 --> 01:22:14,510
Randall Stevens.

1194
01:22:14,594 --> 01:22:15,761
Who?

1195
01:22:16,847 --> 01:22:21,559
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

1196
01:22:21,643 --> 01:22:23,811
That's where the filtering process starts.

1197
01:22:23,895 --> 01:22:27,064
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

1198
01:22:27,149 --> 01:22:28,733
But who is he?

1199
01:22:28,817 --> 01:22:30,860
He's a phantom, an apparition.

1200
01:22:30,944 --> 01:22:32,903
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1201
01:22:32,988 --> 01:22:35,156
I conjured him...

1202
01:22:35,240 --> 01:22:37,283
out of thin air.

1203
01:22:37,367 --> 01:22:40,202
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1204
01:22:43,331 --> 01:22:45,708
Andy, you can’t just make a person up.

1205
01:22:45,792 --> 01:22:48,919
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

1206
01:22:49,004 --> 01:22:52,506
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

1207
01:22:52,591 --> 01:22:55,217
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

1208
01:22:55,302 --> 01:22:57,636
a driver's license, social security number.

1209
01:22:57,721 --> 01:22:58,929
You're shitting me?

1210
01:22:59,014 --> 01:23:00,973
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

1211
01:23:01,057 --> 01:23:03,934
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

1212
01:23:04,019 --> 01:23:06,103
Well, I'll be damned.

1213
01:23:07,397 --> 01:23:09,440
Did I say you were good?

1214
01:23:09,524 --> 01:23:11,692
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

1215
01:23:11,777 --> 01:23:13,819
You know, the funny thing is,

1216
01:23:13,904 --> 01:23:17,865
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1217
01:23:18,909 --> 01:23:21,285
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1218
01:23:30,045 --> 01:23:31,420
Ever bother you?

1219
01:23:32,464 --> 01:23:35,883
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

1220
01:23:35,967 --> 01:23:38,010
Fine line maybe but...

1221
01:23:38,094 --> 01:23:40,805
I also built that library

1222
01:23:40,889 --> 01:23:43,516
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

1223
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,476
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

1224
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:48,312
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1225
01:23:48,396 --> 01:23:50,523
Money instead of sheets.

1226
01:23:50,607 --> 01:23:53,317
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

Well, I just stand there,

01:26:35,855 --> 01:26:37,982
Good. Because if we do this,

1275
01:26:38,066 --> 01:26:40,818
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

1276
01:26:41,945 --> 01:26:44,029
The thing is, see...

1277
01:26:45,198 --> 01:26:47,032
..I don't read so good.

1278
01:26:48,159 --> 01:26:49,368
Well.

1279
01:26:51,121 --> 01:26:53,163
You don't read...

1280
01:26:53,248 --> 01:26:55,332
so well.

1281
01:26:56,793 --> 01:26:58,460
We'll get to that.

1282
01:26:59,546 --> 01:27:01,296
- R.
- R...

1283
01:27:01,381 --> 01:27:02,756
- S.
- S...

1284
01:27:02,841 --> 01:27:05,009
RED: So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1285
01:27:05,093 --> 01:27:07,511
He started walking him through his ABCs.

1286
01:27:09,180 --> 01:27:11,765
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

1287
01:27:11,850 --> 01:27:14,810
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

1288
01:27:17,147 --> 01:27:20,941
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1289
01:27:21,026 --> 01:27:22,985
He really liked the kid.

1290
01:27:23,069 --> 01:27:26,238
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1291
01:27:27,282 --> 01:27:29,324
But that wasn't the only reason.

1292
01:27:29,409 --> 01:27:31,869
Prison time is slow time.

1293
01:27:32,912 --> 01:27:35,164
So you do what you can to keep going.

1294
01:27:35,248 --> 01:27:37,499
Some fellas collect stamps.

1295
01:27:37,500 --> 01:27:40,127
Others build matchstick houses.

1296
01:27:41,171 --> 01:27:43,547
Andy built a library.

1297
01:27:44,591 --> 01:27:46,633
Now he needed a new project.

1298
01:27:46,718 --> 01:27:48,761
Tommy was it.

1299
01:27:48,845 --> 01:27:53,057
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1300
01:27:53,141 --> 01:27:56,769
The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1301
01:27:58,146 --> 01:27:59,646
In prison,

1302
01:27:59,731 --> 01:28:02,858
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1303
01:28:04,319 --> 01:28:08,781
By 1966, right about the time
Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

1304
01:28:08,782 --> 01:28:10,824
it was lovely Raquel.

1305
01:28:13,203 --> 01:28:14,828
(Clock ticks)

1306
01:28:28,093 --> 01:28:29,134
Time.

1307
01:28:35,141 --> 01:28:36,433
Well?

1308
01:28:37,519 --> 01:28:39,061
Well, it's for shit.

1309
01:28:39,145 --> 01:28:41,647
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

1310
01:28:41,731 --> 01:28:44,900
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

1311
01:28:44,984 --> 01:28:48,695
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1312
01:28:48,780 --> 01:28:51,281
Let's see how the score comes out.

1313
01:28:51,366 --> 01:28:53,992
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

1314
01:28:55,787 --> 01:28:57,704
Two points right there.

1315
01:28:57,789 --> 01:28:59,581
There's your goddamn score!

1316
01:28:59,666 --> 01:29:03,502
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

1317
01:29:04,587 --> 01:29:06,130
Fuck this place!

1318
01:29:06,131 --> 01:29:07,422
Fuck it!

1319
01:29:26,234 --> 01:29:28,986
I feel bad. I let him down.

1320
01:29:29,070 --> 01:29:31,155
Ah, that's crap, kid.

1321
01:29:31,156 --> 01:29:32,698
He's proud of you.

1322
01:29:32,782 --> 01:29:35,909
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

1323
01:29:35,994 --> 01:29:38,871
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

1324
01:29:38,955 --> 01:29:40,998
He used to be a banker on the outside.

1325
01:29:41,082 --> 01:29:43,125
What's he in here for, anyway?

1326
01:29:43,209 --> 01:29:44,710
Murder.

1327
01:29:45,837 --> 01:29:47,588
The hell you say!

1328
01:29:49,716 --> 01:29:52,009
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1329
01:29:53,052 --> 01:29:55,512
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

1330
01:29:55,597 --> 01:29:57,681
He greased them both.

1331
01:30:05,565 --> 01:30:07,441
What?

1332
01:30:07,525 --> 01:30:09,902
About four years ago,

1333
01:30:09,986 --> 01:30:13,071
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

1334
01:30:14,324 --> 01:30:17,409
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1335
01:30:18,703 --> 01:30:20,746
About six months left to go,

1336
01:30:20,830 --> 01:30:22,873
I get a new cellmate in.

1337
01:30:22,957 --> 01:30:24,833
Elmo Blatch.

1338
01:30:25,877 --> 01:30:27,461
Big, twitchy fucker.

1339
01:30:27,462 --> 01:30:29,755
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

1340
01:30:29,839 --> 01:30:31,882
You know what I'm saying?

1341
01:30:31,966 --> 01:30:34,009
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1342
01:30:34,093 --> 01:30:37,304
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

1343
01:30:37,388 --> 01:30:39,264
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

1344
01:30:39,349 --> 01:30:42,351
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

1345
01:30:43,478 --> 01:30:45,520
Talked all the time, too.

1346
01:30:45,605 --> 01:30:47,940
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

1347
01:30:48,024 --> 01:30:50,067
Places he'd been in,

1348
01:30:50,151 --> 01:30:52,819
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

1349
01:30:52,904 --> 01:30:55,322
Even people he'd killed.

1350
01:30:57,158 --> 01:30:59,534
People who gave him shit.

1351
01:31:00,578 --> 01:31:02,621
That's how he put it.

1352
01:31:02,705 --> 01:31:04,248
So...

1353
01:31:04,332 --> 01:31:06,416
one night, like a joke,

1354
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:10,754
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

1355
01:31:10,838 --> 01:31:12,631
So he says...

1356
01:31:12,715 --> 01:31:16,343
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

1357
01:31:17,470 --> 01:31:21,056
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

1358
01:31:23,476 --> 01:31:25,477
So I pick out this guy,

1359
01:31:26,521 --> 01:31:29,106
go in one night and do his place.

1360
01:31:31,276 --> 01:31:33,277
He wakes up.

1361
01:31:33,361 --> 01:31:35,404
He gives me shit.

1362
01:31:36,447 --> 01:31:38,532
So I killed him.

1363
01:31:39,575 --> 01:31:41,660
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1364
01:31:43,955 --> 01:31:45,872
That's the best part.

1365
01:31:46,916 --> 01:31:50,127
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

1366
01:31:50,211 --> 01:31:52,296
But she's married to some other guy.

1367
01:31:53,339 --> 01:31:55,424
Some hotshot banker.

1368
01:31:57,218 --> 01:31:59,303
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1369
01:32:10,440 --> 01:32:14,276
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

1370
01:32:15,903 --> 01:32:18,780
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

1371
01:32:18,865 --> 01:32:20,490
Sir?

1372
01:32:20,575 --> 01:32:22,242
Well...

1373
01:32:22,327 --> 01:32:25,704
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

1374
01:32:25,788 --> 01:32:27,873
He hears your tale of woe

1375
01:32:27,957 --> 01:32:30,876
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

1376
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:33,003
He's young, not terribly bright.

1377
01:32:33,087 --> 01:32:36,965
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

1378
01:32:37,050 --> 01:32:39,176
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1379
01:32:39,260 --> 01:32:43,305
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

1380
01:32:43,389 --> 01:32:46,516
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

1381
01:32:46,601 --> 01:32:48,810
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

1382
01:32:48,895 --> 01:32:51,104
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

1383
01:32:51,189 --> 01:32:54,358
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

1384
01:32:54,442 --> 01:32:57,652
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

1385
01:32:57,737 --> 01:32:59,780
The chances are he'd be released by now.

1386
01:32:59,864 --> 01:33:02,449
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

1387
01:33:02,533 --> 01:33:04,701
There's a chance, isn't there?

1388
01:33:06,746 --> 01:33:08,622
How can you be so obtuse?

1389
01:33:08,706 --> 01:33:10,207
What?

1390
01:33:11,709 --> 01:33:13,543
What did you call me?

1391
01:33:13,628 --> 01:33:15,462
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1392
01:33:15,546 --> 01:33:17,339
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

1393
01:33:17,423 --> 01:33:20,258
The country club will have his old timecards,

1394
01:33:20,343 --> 01:33:22,469
records, W-2s,

1395
01:33:22,553 --> 01:33:26,556
- with his name on them.
- If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

1396
01:33:26,641 --> 01:33:30,602
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

1397
01:33:30,686 --> 01:33:35,690
I would never mention what goes on in here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

1398
01:33:37,485 --> 01:33:40,487
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

1399
01:33:40,571 --> 01:33:42,447
Not in this office.

1400
01:33:42,448 --> 01:33:44,574
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

1401
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:47,911
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

1402
01:33:47,995 --> 01:33:49,371
Solitary. A month.

1403
01:33:49,455 --> 01:33:51,623
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

1404
01:33:51,707 --> 01:33:54,960
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

1405
01:33:54,961 --> 01:33:56,962
It's my life! Don't you understand?

1406
01:33:57,046 --> 01:33:59,506
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

1407
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:00,841
No!

1408
01:34:00,925 --> 01:34:02,759
A month in the hole.

1409
01:34:02,844 --> 01:34:05,429
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

1410
01:34:05,513 --> 01:34:07,305
It's all my fault.

1411
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:08,807
Oh, bullshit.

1412
01:34:08,891 --> 01:34:12,185
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

1413
01:34:12,270 --> 01:34:14,646
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

1414
01:34:14,730 --> 01:34:16,898
I mean, for real innocent?

1415
01:34:16,983 --> 01:34:19,025
It looks that way.

1416
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:21,153
Sweet Jesus.

1417
01:34:21,237 --> 01:34:23,280
How long's he been here now?

1418
01:34:23,364 --> 01:34:25,407
1947. What is that?

1419
01:34:25,491 --> 01:34:27,033
- 19 years.
TOMMY: 19 years...

1420
01:34:27,118 --> 01:34:29,744
GUARD: Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1421
01:34:32,123 --> 01:34:34,374
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

1422
01:34:35,585 --> 01:34:38,503
What you got? Board of Education.

1423
01:34:38,588 --> 01:34:41,256
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

1424
01:34:41,340 --> 01:34:44,384
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1425
01:34:44,469 --> 01:34:46,553
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

1426
01:34:47,597 --> 01:34:50,348
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

1427
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:53,602
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

1428
01:34:54,645 --> 01:34:56,730
Hey, Red!

1429
01:34:57,857 --> 01:35:00,275
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

1430
01:35:05,865 --> 01:35:07,949
Well, shit.

1431
01:35:20,171 --> 01:35:22,881
The kid passed. C+ average.

1432
01:35:22,965 --> 01:35:25,050
Thought you'd like to know.

1433
01:35:41,609 --> 01:35:43,693
The Warden wants to talk.

1434
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:58,208
Out here?

1435
01:35:58,292 --> 01:36:00,377
That's what the man said.

1436
01:36:16,686 --> 01:36:18,478
Warden?

1437
01:36:18,563 --> 01:36:20,647
Tommy.

1438
01:36:26,112 --> 01:36:27,571
Tommy...

1439
01:36:27,655 --> 01:36:31,741
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1440
01:36:33,160 --> 01:36:35,245
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1441
01:36:53,723 --> 01:36:55,807
We got a situation here.

1442
01:36:56,851 --> 01:36:58,893
I think you can appreciate that.

1443
01:36:58,978 --> 01:37:00,437
Yes, sir.

1444
01:37:00,521 --> 01:37:02,022
I sure can.

1445
01:37:02,106 --> 01:37:06,151
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

1446
01:37:07,862 --> 01:37:10,405
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

1447
01:37:12,617 --> 01:37:14,701
The right thing to do.

1448
01:37:16,037 --> 01:37:19,039
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1449
01:37:20,750 --> 01:37:22,792
You understand?

1450
01:37:24,170 --> 01:37:26,254
I need your help, son.

1451
01:37:27,673 --> 01:37:29,758
If I'm going to move on this,

1452
01:37:29,759 --> 01:37:32,510
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

1453
01:37:34,055 --> 01:37:37,474
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1454
01:37:37,558 --> 01:37:39,142
Yes, sir.

1455
01:37:39,143 --> 01:37:40,769
Absolutely.

1456
01:37:40,853 --> 01:37:43,938
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

1457
01:37:44,023 --> 01:37:46,441
having placed your hand on the Good Book

1458
01:37:46,442 --> 01:37:49,152
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

1459
01:37:49,236 --> 01:37:51,363
Just give me that chance.

1460
01:37:55,284 --> 01:37:56,951
That's what I thought.

1461
01:38:29,402 --> 01:38:31,486
(Keys rattle)

1462
01:38:44,041 --> 01:38:46,126
I'm sure by now you've heard...

1463
01:38:47,378 --> 01:38:48,753
A terrible thing.

1464
01:38:50,214 --> 01:38:53,800
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1465
01:38:54,885 --> 01:38:57,512
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1466
01:38:58,556 --> 01:39:00,640
Truly, it did.

1467
01:39:02,685 --> 01:39:04,769
We just have to put it behind us.

1468
01:39:06,939 --> 01:39:08,356
Move on.

1469
01:39:09,817 --> 01:39:11,693
I'm done.

1470
01:39:12,737 --> 01:39:14,821
Everything stops.

1471
01:39:15,865 --> 01:39:18,700
Get someone else to run your scams.

1472
01:39:20,035 --> 01:39:22,120
Nothing stops.

1473
01:39:23,164 --> 01:39:25,248
Nothing.

1474
01:39:27,001 --> 01:39:29,085
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1475
01:39:30,963 --> 01:39:33,548
No more protection from the guards.

1476
01:39:33,632 --> 01:39:35,967
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

1477
01:39:36,051 --> 01:39:38,219
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

1478
01:39:39,972 --> 01:39:42,474
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1479
01:39:43,768 --> 01:39:45,810
And the library?

1480
01:39:45,895 --> 01:39:47,020
Gone.

1481
01:39:47,104 --> 01:39:49,481
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1482
01:39:50,524 --> 01:39:53,318
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

1483
01:39:53,402 --> 01:39:55,445
They'll see the flames for miles.

1484
01:39:55,529 --> 01:39:58,031
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1485
01:39:59,617 --> 01:40:01,534
You understand me?

1486
01:40:01,619 --> 01:40:03,703
Catching my drift?

1487
01:40:06,791 --> 01:40:08,875
Or am I being obtuse?

1488
01:40:20,012 --> 01:40:22,138
Give him another month to think about it.

1489
01:40:30,648 --> 01:40:32,732
(Lock clicks)

1490
01:41:09,728 --> 01:41:12,772
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

1491
01:41:12,857 --> 01:41:14,941
Like a closed book.

1492
01:41:16,151 --> 01:41:18,903
Complained about it all the time.

1493
01:41:18,988 --> 01:41:21,072
She was beautiful.

1494
01:41:23,284 --> 01:41:25,368
God, I loved her.

1495
01:41:28,372 --> 01:41:30,707
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1496
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:35,295
I killed her, Red.

1497
01:41:36,755 --> 01:41:38,840
I didn't pull the trigger.

1498
01:41:40,259 --> 01:41:42,343
But I drove her away.

1499
01:41:43,554 --> 01:41:46,097
That's why she died, because of me.

1500
01:41:46,181 --> 01:41:48,266
The way I am.

1501
01:41:56,609 --> 01:41:58,693
That don't make you a murderer.

1502
01:42:01,906 --> 01:42:03,990
A bad husband, maybe.

1503
01:42:07,369 --> 01:42:10,747
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1504
01:42:10,831 --> 01:42:12,248
No, I didn't.

1505
01:42:12,333 --> 01:42:14,375
Somebody else did.

1506
01:42:15,669 --> 01:42:17,754
And I wound up in here.

1507
01:42:20,132 --> 01:42:22,216
Bad luck, I guess.

1508
01:42:25,137 --> 01:42:26,846
Yeah.

1509
01:42:26,931 --> 01:42:29,223
It floats around.

1510
01:42:29,308 --> 01:42:31,768
It's got to land on somebody.

1511
01:42:31,852 --> 01:42:34,103
It was my turn, that's all.

1512
01:42:35,189 --> 01:42:37,649
I was in the path of the tornado.

1513
01:42:44,239 --> 01:42:47,992
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

1514
01:42:52,081 --> 01:42:53,998
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

1515
01:42:55,250 --> 01:42:56,918
Me?

1516
01:42:59,213 --> 01:43:00,672
Yeah.

1517
01:43:01,715 --> 01:43:03,675
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

1518
01:43:03,759 --> 01:43:07,261
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs,
they'll let me out.

1519
01:43:09,181 --> 01:43:11,265
I tell you where I'd go.

1520
01:43:12,476 --> 01:43:14,102
Zihuatanejo.

1521
01:43:14,186 --> 01:43:16,104
Zi...what?

1522
01:43:16,188 --> 01:43:18,231
Zihuatanejo.

1523
01:43:18,315 --> 01:43:20,400
It's in Mexico.

1524
01:43:22,194 --> 01:43:24,404
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1525
01:43:25,656 --> 01:43:28,032
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1526
01:43:28,117 --> 01:43:29,575
No.

1527
01:43:29,660 --> 01:43:31,744
They say it has no memory.

1528
01:43:34,206 --> 01:43:36,749
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

1529
01:43:38,335 --> 01:43:40,420
A warm place with no memory.

1530
01:43:43,716 --> 01:43:46,009
Open up a little hotel,

1531
01:43:47,845 --> 01:43:49,721
right on the beach.

1532
01:43:49,805 --> 01:43:51,848
Buy some worthless old boat,

1533
01:43:51,932 --> 01:43:54,017
fix it up new.

1534
01:43:56,979 --> 01:43:58,187
Take my guests out.

1535
01:43:58,272 --> 01:44:00,356
Charter fishing.

1536
01:44:04,278 --> 01:44:06,904
Zihuatanejo, huh?

1537
01:44:09,533 --> 01:44:13,411
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

1538
01:44:19,835 --> 01:44:22,545
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

1539
01:44:29,303 --> 01:44:31,387
I've been in here most of my life.

1540
01:44:32,890 --> 01:44:34,682
I'm an institutional man now.

1541
01:44:34,767 --> 01:44:36,851
Just like Brooks was.

1542
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:40,521
Well, you underestimate yourself.

1543
01:44:40,606 --> 01:44:42,690
I don't think so.

1544
01:44:45,319 --> 01:44:49,530
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

1545
01:44:49,615 --> 01:44:53,534
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1546
01:44:53,619 --> 01:44:56,037
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

1547
01:44:58,123 --> 01:45:00,458
The Pacific Ocean?

1548
01:45:00,542 --> 01:45:02,585
Shit.

1549
01:45:02,669 --> 01:45:05,838
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

1550
01:45:05,923 --> 01:45:09,383
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

1551
01:45:11,303 --> 01:45:14,931
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1552
01:45:15,015 --> 01:45:17,183
That hotel, that boat.

1553
01:45:18,769 --> 01:45:20,937
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1554
01:45:25,567 --> 01:45:28,444
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

1555
01:45:28,529 --> 01:45:30,571
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

1556
01:45:30,656 --> 01:45:33,616
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

1557
01:45:33,700 --> 01:45:35,743
And that's the way it is.

1558
01:45:35,828 --> 01:45:38,454
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

1559
01:45:40,207 --> 01:45:42,291
It's down there and I'm in here.

1560
01:45:45,003 --> 01:45:47,797
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

1561
01:45:50,634 --> 01:45:52,677
Get busy living

1562
01:45:52,761 --> 01:45:55,680
or get busy dying.

1563
01:45:59,476 --> 01:46:01,561
Andy.

1564
01:46:04,022 --> 01:46:06,107
Red.

1565
01:46:07,151 --> 01:46:09,569
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

1566
01:46:09,653 --> 01:46:11,487
Sure, Andy.

1567
01:46:11,572 --> 01:46:12,905
Anything.

1568
01:46:13,991 --> 01:46:17,451
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1569
01:46:19,454 --> 01:46:23,249
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1570
01:46:23,333 --> 01:46:25,376
It's got a long rock wall

1571
01:46:25,460 --> 01:46:27,378
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1572
01:46:27,462 --> 01:46:30,173
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

1573
01:46:31,550 --> 01:46:34,260
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1574
01:46:35,470 --> 01:46:39,265
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

1575
01:46:40,767 --> 01:46:42,852
I asked and she said yes.

1576
01:46:46,982 --> 01:46:49,025
Promise me, Red,

1577
01:46:49,109 --> 01:46:51,110
if you ever get out,

1578
01:46:51,195 --> 01:46:53,237
find that spot.

1579
01:46:54,281 --> 01:46:59,744
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has
no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

1580
01:46:59,828 --> 01:47:02,330
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

1581
01:47:05,500 --> 01:47:08,294
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

1582
01:47:08,378 --> 01:47:10,379
What, Andy?

1583
01:47:10,464 --> 01:47:12,548
What's buried under there?

1584
01:47:14,343 --> 01:47:17,720
You'll have to pry it up to see.

1585
01:47:23,060 --> 01:47:25,144
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

1586
01:47:26,188 --> 01:47:28,272
He's talking funnier.

1587
01:47:28,357 --> 01:47:31,734
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

1588
01:47:31,818 --> 01:47:35,863
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

1589
01:47:36,949 --> 01:47:38,407
Oh, Lord.

1590
01:47:38,492 --> 01:47:40,534
What?

1591
01:47:42,204 --> 01:47:44,538
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

1592
01:47:44,623 --> 01:47:48,125
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

1593
01:47:48,210 --> 01:47:50,044
Six feet long.

1594
01:47:50,128 --> 01:47:51,587
And you gave it to him?

1595
01:47:51,672 --> 01:47:54,340
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

1596
01:47:54,341 --> 01:47:56,050
Jesus, Heywood.

1597
01:47:56,134 --> 01:47:58,386
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

1598
01:47:58,470 --> 01:48:00,388
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1599
01:48:00,472 --> 01:48:01,514
No.

1600
01:48:02,557 --> 01:48:04,767
Andy would never do that.

1601
01:48:04,768 --> 01:48:06,852
Never.

1602
01:48:07,896 --> 01:48:09,981
I don't know.

1603
01:48:12,025 --> 01:48:14,110
Every man has his breaking point.

1604
01:48:16,738 --> 01:48:17,989
Lickety-split.

1605
01:48:18,073 --> 01:48:20,950
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

1606
01:48:37,050 --> 01:48:39,135
Three deposits tonight.

1607
01:48:47,519 --> 01:48:49,603
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1608
01:48:49,604 --> 01:48:53,065
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

1609
01:48:53,150 --> 01:48:54,525
Yes, sir.

1610
01:48:59,823 --> 01:49:01,490
It's good having you back, Andy.

1611
01:49:01,575 --> 01:49:04,327
The place wasn't the same without you.

1612
01:49:06,455 --> 01:49:08,539
(Whistles)

1613
01:49:51,375 --> 01:49:54,126
GUARD: Lights out!
(Click of light switches)

1614
01:49:58,423 --> 01:50:00,508
(Footsteps)

1615
01:50:06,390 --> 01:50:08,474
(Outer door closes)

1616
01:50:24,866 --> 01:50:27,159
RED: I've had some long nights in stir.

1617
01:50:28,203 --> 01:50:30,913
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts,

1618
01:50:30,997 --> 01:50:32,832
time can draw out like a blade.

1619
01:50:32,833 --> 01:50:34,917
(Thunder rumbles)

1620
01:50:39,214 --> 01:50:41,549
That was the longest night of my life.

1621
01:50:51,768 --> 01:50:54,103
(Gate buzzer)

1622
01:50:57,691 --> 01:50:59,316
GUARD: Give me a count.

1623
01:51:03,655 --> 01:51:05,698
Tier 3 South. Clear.

1624
01:51:05,782 --> 01:51:07,116
Tier 4 North. Clear.

1625
01:51:07,200 --> 01:51:10,786
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2.

1626
01:51:10,871 --> 01:51:13,956
- Cell 245.
- Dufresne.

1627
01:51:14,040 --> 01:51:16,959
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

1628
01:51:19,463 --> 01:51:23,507
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

1629
01:51:31,099 --> 01:51:34,477
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1630
01:51:34,561 --> 01:51:37,646
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

1631
01:51:37,731 --> 01:51:39,565
You hear me?

1632
01:51:46,072 --> 01:51:48,157
Oh, my holy God.

1633
01:52:00,253 --> 01:52:02,338
(Siren wails)

1634
01:52:05,008 --> 01:52:07,718
I want every man on this cell block questioned.

1635
01:52:07,719 --> 01:52:09,929
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1636
01:52:10,013 --> 01:52:11,222
Him!

1637
01:52:13,141 --> 01:52:15,226
Open 237.

1638
01:52:18,230 --> 01:52:20,356
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

1639
01:52:20,440 --> 01:52:21,982
Don't say that to me, Haig.

1640
01:52:22,067 --> 01:52:24,318
Don't say that to me again.

1641
01:52:24,402 --> 01:52:25,486
But, sir, he wasn't.

1642
01:52:25,570 --> 01:52:27,738
I can see that, Haig!

1643
01:52:27,822 --> 01:52:29,615
You think I'm blind?

1644
01:52:29,616 --> 01:52:32,743
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

1645
01:52:32,827 --> 01:52:33,827
No, sir.

1646
01:52:33,912 --> 01:52:35,955
What about you?

1647
01:52:36,039 --> 01:52:37,873
Are you blind?

1648
01:52:37,958 --> 01:52:40,501
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1649
01:52:40,585 --> 01:52:43,879
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

1650
01:52:43,964 --> 01:52:45,839
Dufresne.

1651
01:52:47,092 --> 01:52:48,759
He was in his cell at lights out.

1652
01:52:48,843 --> 01:52:52,054
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

1653
01:52:53,139 --> 01:52:55,015
I want him found.

1654
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:57,685
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

1655
01:52:57,769 --> 01:52:58,811
Now!

1656
01:52:58,812 --> 01:53:00,312
Yes, sir!

1657
01:53:01,439 --> 01:53:04,024
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

1658
01:53:06,861 --> 01:53:07,903
Stand.

1659
01:53:09,030 --> 01:53:10,281
Well?

1660
01:53:13,660 --> 01:53:14,785
Well, what?

1661
01:53:14,869 --> 01:53:18,330
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1662
01:53:19,374 --> 01:53:21,000
He must have said something.

1663
01:53:21,084 --> 01:53:23,127
No, sir, Warden.

1664
01:53:23,211 --> 01:53:24,670
Not a word.

1665
01:53:26,673 --> 01:53:28,674
Lord, it's a miracle!

1666
01:53:29,718 --> 01:53:32,177
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

1667
01:53:32,262 --> 01:53:34,013
Nothing left but...

1668
01:53:34,097 --> 01:53:37,016
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1669
01:53:37,100 --> 01:53:38,851
And that cupcake on the wall.

1670
01:53:38,935 --> 01:53:40,561
Let's ask her.

1671
01:53:40,645 --> 01:53:44,607
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

1672
01:53:45,692 --> 01:53:46,775
Ah...

1673
01:53:46,776 --> 01:53:48,235
I guess not.

1674
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:51,196
Why should she be any different?

1675
01:53:51,281 --> 01:53:53,741
This is a conspiracy.

1676
01:53:53,825 --> 01:53:56,035
That's what this is.

1677
01:53:56,119 --> 01:53:57,661
One big...

1678
01:53:57,746 --> 01:54:00,497
damn conspiracy!

1679
01:54:00,582 --> 01:54:03,250
And everyone's in on it!

1680
01:54:03,335 --> 01:54:04,627
Including her!

1681
01:54:05,962 --> 01:54:07,630
(Clattering)

1682
01:54:31,404 --> 01:54:33,113
(Sirens blare)

1683
01:54:39,287 --> 01:54:41,163
RED: In 1966,

1684
01:54:41,247 --> 01:54:43,916
Andy Dufresne escaped

1685
01:54:44,000 --> 01:54:46,085
from Shawshank Prison.

1686
01:54:47,754 --> 01:54:50,506
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

1687
01:54:50,590 --> 01:54:52,633
a bar of soap

1688
01:54:52,717 --> 01:54:57,096
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

1689
01:55:01,476 --> 01:55:06,313
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

1690
01:55:06,398 --> 01:55:09,108
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1691
01:55:27,669 --> 01:55:29,753
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1692
01:55:30,797 --> 01:55:34,299
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

1693
01:55:34,384 --> 01:55:36,677
An Ice Age here,

1694
01:55:36,761 --> 01:55:39,346
a million years of mountain-building there.

1695
01:55:40,390 --> 01:55:42,808
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1696
01:55:44,018 --> 01:55:46,061
That's all it takes, really.

1697
01:55:46,146 --> 01:55:48,188
Pressure...

1698
01:55:48,273 --> 01:55:50,149
and time.

1699
01:55:50,233 --> 01:55:53,569
That and a big goddamn poster.

1700
01:55:54,654 --> 01:55:56,697
(Coughing)

1701
01:55:56,781 --> 01:55:58,157
Like I said,

1702
01:55:58,158 --> 01:56:01,952
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1703
01:56:04,748 --> 01:56:09,918
It turns out Andy's favorite hobby
was toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

1704
01:56:10,003 --> 01:56:12,087
A handful at a time.

1705
01:56:13,923 --> 01:56:16,091
I guess after Tommy was killed,

1706
01:56:16,176 --> 01:56:19,011
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

1707
01:56:19,095 --> 01:56:21,305
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

1708
01:56:22,599 --> 01:56:24,683
I'm just about finished, sir.

1709
01:56:46,080 --> 01:56:48,165
Three deposits tonight.

1710
01:56:55,340 --> 01:56:57,382
Andy did like he was told.

1711
01:56:58,426 --> 01:57:01,929
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

1712
01:57:05,517 --> 01:57:07,559
The guard simply didn't notice.

1713
01:57:07,644 --> 01:57:09,686
Neither did I.

1714
01:57:09,771 --> 01:57:14,107
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

1715
01:57:48,810 --> 01:57:50,894
(Thunderclap)

1716
01:59:18,149 --> 01:59:24,321
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

1717
01:59:24,405 --> 01:59:25,572
(Gags)

1718
01:59:25,657 --> 01:59:27,658
Or maybe I just don't want to.

1719
01:59:27,742 --> 01:59:29,826
(Coughs and spits)

1720
01:59:32,372 --> 01:59:34,581
500 yards.

1721
01:59:35,625 --> 01:59:38,126
That's the length of five football fields.

1722
01:59:39,170 --> 01:59:41,421
Just shy of half a mile.

1723
02:00:22,964 --> 02:00:24,673
(Laughs)

1724
02:00:36,644 --> 02:00:41,189
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

1725
02:00:41,274 --> 02:00:44,693
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

1726
02:00:44,777 --> 02:00:47,195
strode into the Maine National Bank.

1727
02:00:47,280 --> 02:00:49,322
Until that moment,

1728
02:00:49,407 --> 02:00:51,283
he didn't exist,

1729
02:00:51,367 --> 02:00:52,701
except on paper.

1730
02:00:52,785 --> 02:00:53,827
May I help you?

1731
02:00:53,911 --> 02:00:55,954
RED: He had all the proper ID,

1732
02:00:56,039 --> 02:00:59,666
driver's license, birth certificate,
social security card.

1733
02:00:59,751 --> 02:01:03,045
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1734
02:01:03,129 --> 02:01:06,173
I must say, I'm sorry to be losing your business.

1735
02:01:06,257 --> 02:01:08,258
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1736
02:01:08,342 --> 02:01:10,135
Thank you.

1737
02:01:10,219 --> 02:01:12,012
I'm sure I will.

1738
02:01:12,096 --> 02:01:14,222
Here's your cashier's check, sir.

1739
02:01:14,307 --> 02:01:16,349
Will there be anything else?

1740
02:01:16,434 --> 02:01:17,434
Please...

1741
02:01:17,518 --> 02:01:20,604
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1742
02:01:20,688 --> 02:01:22,898
I'd be happy to.

1743
02:01:22,982 --> 02:01:25,317
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

1744
02:01:25,401 --> 02:01:30,197
RED: Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1745
02:01:31,365 --> 02:01:37,829
All told, he blew town with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1746
02:01:37,914 --> 02:01:40,373
Severance pay for 19 years.

1747
02:01:40,458 --> 02:01:42,542
(Phone rings)

1748
02:01:48,508 --> 02:01:50,801
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1749
02:01:58,476 --> 02:02:00,560
(Sirens wail)

1750
02:02:29,757 --> 02:02:31,800
(Sirens approaching)

1751
02:02:43,521 --> 02:02:46,523
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1752
02:02:46,607 --> 02:02:51,236
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything
you say will be held against you in court.

1753
02:02:51,320 --> 02:02:53,196
RED: I wasn't there to see it.

1754
02:02:53,281 --> 02:02:58,160
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

1755
02:03:03,583 --> 02:03:06,376
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

1756
02:03:22,351 --> 02:03:23,810
Samuel Norton?

1757
02:03:23,895 --> 02:03:27,147
- We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.
(Banging on door)

1758
02:03:30,026 --> 02:03:31,151
Norton!

1759
02:03:31,235 --> 02:03:32,903
Open the door.

1760
02:03:32,987 --> 02:03:34,738
I'm not sure which key it is.

1761
02:03:37,617 --> 02:03:39,284
Norton!

1762
02:03:44,749 --> 02:03:46,833
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

1763
02:03:58,137 --> 02:04:01,723
RED: I like to think
the last thing that went through his head,

1764
02:04:01,807 --> 02:04:03,516
other than that bullet,

1765
02:04:03,601 --> 02:04:07,604
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1766
02:04:09,273 --> 02:04:10,357
Carter, James...

1767
02:04:10,441 --> 02:04:13,818
RED: Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

1768
02:04:13,903 --> 02:04:16,154
I got a postcard in the mail.

1769
02:04:17,865 --> 02:04:20,283
It was blank but the postmark said...

1770
02:04:20,368 --> 02:04:23,119
Fort Hancock, Texas.

1771
02:04:23,204 --> 02:04:25,247
Fort Hancock.

1772
02:04:25,331 --> 02:04:27,374
Right on the border.

1773
02:04:27,458 --> 02:04:29,501
That's where Andy crossed.

1774
02:04:29,585 --> 02:04:33,463
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

1775
02:04:34,507 --> 02:04:36,591
it always makes me laugh.

1776
02:04:38,010 --> 02:04:40,053
Andy Dufresne,

1777
02:04:40,137 --> 02:04:42,514
who crawled through a river of shit

1778
02:04:42,598 --> 02:04:44,683
and came out clean on the other side.

1779
02:04:45,893 --> 02:04:47,936
Andy Dufresne,

1780
02:04:48,020 --> 02:04:49,938
headed for the Pacific.

1781
02:04:52,525 --> 02:04:54,567
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

1782
02:04:54,652 --> 02:04:58,863
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

1783
02:04:58,948 --> 02:05:02,117
RED: Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1784
02:05:02,201 --> 02:05:04,452
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1785
02:05:04,537 --> 02:05:07,038
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

1786
02:05:07,123 --> 02:05:09,207
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

1787
02:05:10,376 --> 02:05:12,752
RED: Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

1788
02:05:12,837 --> 02:05:14,879
Andy being gone.

1789
02:05:14,964 --> 02:05:18,967
I have to remind myself
that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1790
02:05:20,052 --> 02:05:22,137
Their feathers are just too bright.

1791
02:05:23,681 --> 02:05:25,724
And when they fly away,

1792
02:05:25,808 --> 02:05:29,728
the part of you that knows
it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1793
02:05:31,480 --> 02:05:32,939
But still...

1794
02:05:33,024 --> 02:05:37,193
the place you live in is that much more drab
and empty that they're gone.

1795
02:05:41,741 --> 02:05:43,992
I guess I just miss my friend.

1796
02:06:07,975 --> 02:06:09,851
Please sit down.

1797
02:06:15,441 --> 02:06:17,567
Ellis Boyd Redding.

1798
02:06:17,651 --> 02:06:21,029
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1799
02:06:21,113 --> 02:06:23,490
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

1800
02:06:25,618 --> 02:06:27,702
Rehabilitated?

1801
02:06:29,246 --> 02:06:31,331
Well, now, let me see.

1802
02:06:32,375 --> 02:06:34,709
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means.

1803
02:06:36,504 --> 02:06:39,047
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

1804
02:06:39,131 --> 02:06:41,674
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1805
02:06:44,053 --> 02:06:46,137
To me, it's just a made-up word.

1806
02:06:47,181 --> 02:06:49,432
A politician's word so that...

1807
02:06:49,517 --> 02:06:55,021
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

1808
02:06:57,441 --> 02:06:59,526
What do you really want to know?

1809
02:07:00,694 --> 02:07:02,612
Am I sorry for what I did?

1810
02:07:02,696 --> 02:07:04,406
Well, are you?

1811
02:07:06,033 --> 02:07:08,618
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

1812
02:07:10,204 --> 02:07:13,331
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1813
02:07:17,128 --> 02:07:19,212
I look back on the way I was then.

1814
02:07:21,799 --> 02:07:23,842
A young...

1815
02:07:23,926 --> 02:07:27,011
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

1816
02:07:30,850 --> 02:07:32,934
I wanna talk to him.

1817
02:07:34,311 --> 02:07:36,479
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

1818
02:07:37,523 --> 02:07:39,607
tell him the way things are.

1819
02:07:41,777 --> 02:07:43,862
But I can't.

1820
02:07:45,072 --> 02:07:47,157
That kid's long gone.

1821
02:07:48,451 --> 02:07:50,535
This old man is all that's left.

1822
02:07:52,663 --> 02:07:54,164
I gotta live with that.

1823
02:07:55,499 --> 02:07:57,292
Rehabilitated?

1824
02:07:57,376 --> 02:07:59,377
It's just a bullshit word.

1825
02:07:59,462 --> 02:08:05,383
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny,
and stop wasting my time.

1826
02:08:06,469 --> 02:08:08,511
Because to tell you the truth,

1827
02:08:08,596 --> 02:08:11,097
I don't give a shit.

1828
02:08:49,220 --> 02:08:51,304
(Gate closes)

1829
02:09:10,699 --> 02:09:12,784
(Siren passes outside)

1830
02:09:37,309 --> 02:09:39,394
Here you go, miss.

1831
02:09:41,397 --> 02:09:42,855
Rest room break, boss?

1832
02:09:48,904 --> 02:09:53,199
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

1833
02:09:54,410 --> 02:09:56,077
Yes, sir.

1834
02:10:06,130 --> 02:10:09,173
RED: 40 years
I've been asking permission to piss.

1835
02:10:10,175 --> 02:10:12,385
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1836
02:10:16,515 --> 02:10:18,600
There's a harsh truth to face.

1837
02:10:20,561 --> 02:10:22,895
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

1838
02:10:31,113 --> 02:10:34,574
All I do any more
is think of ways to break my parole...

1839
02:10:35,618 --> 02:10:37,702
..so maybe they'd send me back.

1840
02:10:43,208 --> 02:10:45,293
A terrible thing to live in fear.

1841
02:10:46,670 --> 02:10:50,048
Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.

1842
02:10:52,217 --> 02:10:55,011
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

1843
02:10:56,055 --> 02:10:58,556
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1844
02:11:01,435 --> 02:11:03,519
Only one thing stops me.

1845
02:11:04,563 --> 02:11:06,648
A promise I made to Andy.

1846
02:11:27,378 --> 02:11:29,462
Here it is.

1847
02:11:39,264 --> 02:11:41,349
Much obliged, sir.

1848
02:15:04,595 --> 02:15:06,679
(Bird calls)

1849
02:15:20,152 --> 02:15:21,444
ANDY: Dear Red,

1850
02:15:21,528 --> 02:15:23,988
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

1851
02:15:24,072 --> 02:15:28,326
And if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.

1852
02:15:28,410 --> 02:15:30,995
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

1853
02:15:33,290 --> 02:15:35,374
Zihuatanejo.

1854
02:15:36,418 --> 02:15:37,627
I could use a good man

1855
02:15:37,711 --> 02:15:39,754
to help me get my project on wheels.

1856
02:15:39,838 --> 02:15:41,964
I'll keep an eye out for you

1857
02:15:42,049 --> 02:15:44,091
and the chessboard ready.

1858
02:15:45,135 --> 02:15:46,510
Remember, Red,

1859
02:15:46,595 --> 02:15:48,638
hope is a good thing.

1860
02:15:48,722 --> 02:15:50,765
Maybe the best of things.

1861
02:15:50,849 --> 02:15:52,934
And no good thing ever dies.

1862
02:15:53,977 --> 02:15:56,437
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

1863
02:15:56,521 --> 02:15:58,564
and finds you well.

1864
02:15:58,649 --> 02:16:01,150
Your friend, Andy.

1865
02:16:35,727 --> 02:16:39,605
RED: Get busy living or get busy dying.

1866
02:16:42,109 --> 02:16:44,193
That's goddamn right.

1867
02:16:49,700 --> 02:16:51,826
For the second time in my life,

1868
02:16:51,910 --> 02:16:53,995
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1869
02:16:55,664 --> 02:16:57,748
Parole violation.

1870
02:16:57,749 --> 02:17:01,460
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1871
02:17:02,713 --> 02:17:04,755
Not for an old crook like me.

1872
02:17:04,840 --> 02:17:06,924
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1873
02:17:10,637 --> 02:17:14,765
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head.

1874
02:17:15,809 --> 02:17:18,811
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1875
02:17:18,895 --> 02:17:21,605
A free man at the start of a long journey

1876
02:17:21,690 --> 02:17:24,608
whose conclusion is uncertain.

1877
02:17:27,487 --> 02:17:29,655
I hope I can make it across the border.

1878
02:17:31,533 --> 02:17:34,326
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1879
02:17:36,705 --> 02:17:39,915
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1880
02:17:42,669 --> 02:17:44,545
I hope.
