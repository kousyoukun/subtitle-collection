1
00:02:04,618 --> 00:02:06,743
Mr. Dufresne, describe...

2
00:02:06,786 --> 00:02:12,736
...the confrontation you had with
your wife the night she was murdered.

3
00:02:15,795 --> 00:02:17,795
It was very bitter.

4
00:02:17,797 --> 00:02:23,577
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around.

5
00:02:23,678 --> 00:02:27,290
And she said that she wanted
a divorce in Reno.

6
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,169
- What was your response?
- I told her I would not grant one.

7
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:34,548
"I'll see you in hell
before I see you in Reno. "

8
00:02:34,648 --> 00:02:38,898
Those were your words,
according to your neighbors.

9
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:41,069
If they say so.

10
00:02:41,196 --> 00:02:43,890
I really don't remember.
I was upset.

11
00:02:43,990 --> 00:02:47,519
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

12
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:49,619
She packed a bag.

13
00:02:50,539 --> 00:02:54,234
She packed a bag to go
and stay with Mr. Quentin.

14
00:02:54,334 --> 00:02:58,530
Glenn Quentin, golfpro
at the Snowden Hills Country Club...

15
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,795
...whom you had discovered
was your wife's lover.

16
00:03:04,094 --> 00:03:06,094
Did you follow her?

17
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,832
I went to a few bars first.

18
00:03:08,932 --> 00:03:13,754
Later, I drove to his house
to confront them. They weren't home.

19
00:03:13,854 --> 00:03:16,064
I parked in the turnout...

20
00:03:16,106 --> 00:03:17,174
...and waited.

21
00:03:17,274 --> 00:03:19,274
With what intention?

22
00:03:19,568 --> 00:03:21,568
I'm not sure.

23
00:03:22,112 --> 00:03:23,722
I was confused...

24
00:03:23,822 --> 00:03:25,822
...drunk.

25
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:27,768
I think...

26
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:30,103
...mostly I wanted to scare them.

27
00:03:30,203 --> 00:03:34,441
When they arrived, you went up
to the house and murdered them.

28
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,026
I was sobering up.

29
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:39,905
I got back in the car
and I drove home to sleep it off.

30
00:03:40,005 --> 00:03:43,033
Along the way, I threw my gun
into the Royal River.

31
00:03:43,133 --> 00:03:45,285
I've been very clear on this point.

32
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:49,581
I get hazy where the cleaning woman
shows up the following morning...

33
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:52,375
...and finds your wife in bed
with her lover...

34
00:03:52,475 --> 00:03:55,535
...riddled with.38-caliber bullets.

35
00:03:55,937 --> 00:04:00,926
Does that strike you as a
fantastic coincidence, or is it just me?

36
00:04:01,026 --> 00:04:02,135
Yes, it does.

37
00:04:02,235 --> 00:04:05,514
Yet you still maintain
you threw your gun into the river...

38
00:04:05,614 --> 00:04:07,766
...before the murders took place.

39
00:04:07,866 --> 00:04:10,118
That's very convenient.

40
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:12,327
It's the truth.

41
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:17,025
The police dragged that river for
three days, and nary a gun was found...

42
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:21,321
...so no comparison could be made
between your gun and the bullets...

43
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:25,409
...taken from the bloodstained corpses
of the victims.

44
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:27,928
And that also...

45
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:32,211
...is very convenient.
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

46
00:04:33,183 --> 00:04:35,335
Since I am innocent of this crime...

47
00:04:35,435 --> 00:04:40,875
...I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

48
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,445
Ladies and gentlemen, you've heard
all the evidence.

49
00:05:01,545 --> 00:05:05,449
We have the accused at the scene
of the crime. We have footprints.

50
00:05:05,549 --> 00:05:08,535
Bullets on the ground
bearing his fingerprints.

51
00:05:08,635 --> 00:05:11,705
A broken bourbon bottle,
likewise with fingerprints.

52
00:05:11,805 --> 00:05:13,457
And most of all...

53
00:05:13,557 --> 00:05:16,752
...we have a beautiful young woman
and her lover...

54
00:05:16,852 --> 00:05:19,827
...lying dead in each other's arms.

55
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:22,691
They had sinned.

56
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,535
But was their crime so great...

57
00:05:26,695 --> 00:05:29,014
...as to merit a death sentence?

58
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:31,579
While you think about that...

59
00:05:32,826 --> 00:05:34,826
...think about this:

60
00:05:35,495 --> 00:05:39,249
A revolver holds six bullets, not eight.

61
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:43,236
I submit that this was not
a hot-blooded crime of passion.

62
00:05:43,336 --> 00:05:46,239
That at least could be understood,
if not condoned.

63
00:05:46,339 --> 00:05:47,491
No.

64
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:48,825
This was revenge...

65
00:05:48,925 --> 00:05:53,455
...of a much more brutal,
cold-blooded nature. Consider this:

66
00:05:53,555 --> 00:05:55,932
Four bullets per victim.

67
00:05:56,683 --> 00:05:58,835
Not six shots fired, but eight.

68
00:05:58,935 --> 00:06:02,522
That means that he fired the gun empty...

69
00:06:02,772 --> 00:06:04,841
...and then stopped to reload...

70
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:08,512
...so that he could shoot
each of them again.

71
00:06:08,612 --> 00:06:11,156
An extra bullet per lover...

72
00:06:11,948 --> 00:06:13,948
...right in the head.

73
00:06:17,204 --> 00:06:22,317
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

74
00:06:22,417 --> 00:06:25,732
It chills my blood just to look at you.

75
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:29,366
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine...

76
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:33,995
...I hereby order you to serve
two life sentences back-to-back...

77
00:06:34,095 --> 00:06:37,580
...one for each of your victims.
So be it!

78
00:07:01,748 --> 00:07:03,748
Sit.

79
00:07:07,462 --> 00:07:11,116
We see you've served
20 years of a life sentence?

80
00:07:11,216 --> 00:07:14,745
- Yes, sir.
- You feel you've been rehabilitated?

81
00:07:14,845 --> 00:07:17,430
Yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

82
00:07:18,557 --> 00:07:20,937
I mean, I learned my lesson.

83
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:25,213
I can honestly say that I'm a changed man.

84
00:07:28,316 --> 00:07:30,761
I'm no longer a danger to society.

85
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:33,071
That's God's honest truth.

86
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:10,550
Hey, Red.

87
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:12,052
How'd it go?

88
00:08:12,152 --> 00:08:14,471
Same old shit, different day.

89
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:16,556
Yeah, I know how you feel.

90
00:08:16,656 --> 00:08:19,291
I'm up for rejection next week.

91
00:08:19,409 --> 00:08:22,044
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

92
00:08:22,162 --> 00:08:23,563
It happens.

93
00:08:23,663 --> 00:08:25,190
Hey, Red, bump me a deck.

94
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,735
Get out of my face, man!
You're into me for five packs already.

95
00:08:28,835 --> 00:08:30,835
Four!

96
00:08:30,921 --> 00:08:34,491
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

97
00:08:34,591 --> 00:08:36,493
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

98
00:08:36,593 --> 00:08:39,788
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer,
if that's your thing...

99
00:08:39,888 --> 00:08:43,417
...bottle of brandy to celebrate
your kid's high school graduation.

100
00:08:43,517 --> 00:08:45,752
Damn near anything within reason.

101
00:08:45,852 --> 00:08:49,606
Yes, sir!
I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

102
00:08:52,526 --> 00:08:55,554
So when Andy Dufresne
came to me in 1949...

103
00:08:55,654 --> 00:08:59,349
...and asked me to smuggle
Rita Hayworth into the prison for him...

104
00:08:59,449 --> 00:09:01,914
...I told him, "No problem. "

105
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:45,896
Andy came to Shawshank Prison...

106
00:09:45,996 --> 00:09:50,066
...in early 1947 for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

107
00:09:50,166 --> 00:09:54,571
On the outside, he'd been vice president
of a large Portland bank.

108
00:09:54,671 --> 00:09:57,136
Good work for a man so young.

109
00:10:39,716 --> 00:10:41,618
You speak English, butt-steak?

110
00:10:41,718 --> 00:10:43,758
You follow this officer.

111
00:10:56,316 --> 00:11:00,720
I never seen such a sorry-looking
heap of maggot shit in all my life.

112
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:03,406
Hey, fish! Come over here!

113
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,331
Taking bets today, Red?

114
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:30,250
Smokes or coin? Bettor's choice.

115
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:32,502
Smokes. Put me down for two.

116
00:11:32,602 --> 00:11:34,254
All right, who's your horse?

117
00:11:34,354 --> 00:11:36,479
That little sack of shit.

118
00:11:37,732 --> 00:11:41,094
- Eighth. He'll be first.
- Bullshit! I'll take that action.

119
00:11:41,194 --> 00:11:43,574
You're out some smokes, son.

120
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:45,515
If you're so smart, you call it.

121
00:11:45,615 --> 00:11:48,675
I'll take that chubby fat-ass there.

122
00:11:48,869 --> 00:11:52,694
The fifth one.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

123
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:56,666
Fresh fish today!

124
00:11:57,127 --> 00:11:59,127
We're reeling them in!

125
00:11:59,296 --> 00:12:03,366
I admit I didn't think much of Andy
first time I laid eyes on him.

126
00:12:03,466 --> 00:12:06,620
Looked like a stiff breeze
would blow him over.

127
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,955
That was my first impression of the man.

128
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:10,582
What do you say?

129
00:12:10,682 --> 00:12:14,086
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

130
00:12:14,186 --> 00:12:16,313
That guy? Never happen.

131
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:18,882
-10 cigarettes.
- That's a rich bet.

132
00:12:18,982 --> 00:12:21,176
Who's going to prove me wrong?

133
00:12:21,276 --> 00:12:23,276
Heywood? Jigger?

134
00:12:23,361 --> 00:12:24,763
Skeets?

135
00:12:24,863 --> 00:12:26,863
Floyd!

136
00:12:27,157 --> 00:12:29,201
Four brave souls.

137
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:32,270
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

138
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,770
All prisoners,
return to your cellblocks.

139
00:12:56,061 --> 00:12:57,295
Turn to the right!

140
00:12:57,395 --> 00:12:59,395
Eyes front.

141
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:14,479
This is Mr. Hadley.
He's captain of the guards.

142
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,773
I'm Mr. Norton, the warden.

143
00:13:16,873 --> 00:13:19,084
You are convicted felons.

144
00:13:19,376 --> 00:13:21,862
That's why they've sent you to me.

145
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:23,447
Rule number one:

146
00:13:23,547 --> 00:13:25,547
No blasphemy.

147
00:13:25,549 --> 00:13:29,119
I'll not have the Lord's name
taken in vain in my prison.

148
00:13:29,219 --> 00:13:30,495
The other rules...

149
00:13:30,595 --> 00:13:34,166
...you'll figure out as you go along.
Any questions?

150
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:36,266
When do we eat?

151
00:13:44,025 --> 00:13:46,136
You eat when we say you eat.

152
00:13:46,236 --> 00:13:49,639
You shit when we say you shit,
and piss when we say you piss.

153
00:13:49,739 --> 00:13:53,309
You got that,
you maggot-dick motherfucker?

154
00:13:54,411 --> 00:13:55,896
On your feet.

155
00:13:55,996 --> 00:13:57,856
I believe in two things:

156
00:13:57,956 --> 00:14:00,417
Discipline and the Bible.

157
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:03,127
Here, you'll receive both.

158
00:14:03,753 --> 00:14:06,048
Put your trust in the Lord.

159
00:14:06,506 --> 00:14:08,758
Your ass belongs to me.

160
00:14:10,594 --> 00:14:12,594
Welcome to Shawshank.

161
00:14:17,684 --> 00:14:19,684
Unhook them.

162
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:26,441
Turn around.

163
00:14:32,699 --> 00:14:34,699
That's enough.

164
00:14:35,035 --> 00:14:37,415
Move to the end of the cage.

165
00:14:38,038 --> 00:14:40,582
Turn around. Delouse him.

166
00:14:42,709 --> 00:14:44,709
Turn around.

167
00:14:46,796 --> 00:14:49,616
Move out of the cage.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

168
00:14:49,716 --> 00:14:51,716
Next man up!

169
00:14:53,345 --> 00:14:54,871
To the right.

170
00:14:54,971 --> 00:14:56,540
Right. Right.

171
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:58,166
Left.

172
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:02,431
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

173
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:05,715
They march you in
naked as the day you were born...

174
00:15:05,815 --> 00:15:10,220
...skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit.

175
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:12,806
And when they put you in that cell...

176
00:15:12,906 --> 00:15:15,456
...and those bars slam home...

177
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:18,437
...that's when you know it's for real.

178
00:15:18,537 --> 00:15:21,898
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

179
00:15:21,998 --> 00:15:27,098
Nothing left but all the time
in the world to think about it.

180
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:30,824
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

181
00:15:30,924 --> 00:15:33,899
Somebody always breaks down crying.

182
00:15:34,344 --> 00:15:36,344
Happens every time.

183
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,930
The only question is...

184
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:40,972
...who's it going to be?

185
00:15:42,102 --> 00:15:46,012
It's as good a thing
to bet on as any, I guess.

186
00:15:46,106 --> 00:15:48,826
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

187
00:15:57,784 --> 00:15:59,784
Lights out!

188
00:16:19,973 --> 00:16:22,309
I remember my first night.

189
00:16:23,143 --> 00:16:26,062
Seems like a long time ago.

190
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:31,316
Hey, fish.

191
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:33,902
Fish, fish.

192
00:16:35,322 --> 00:16:38,127
What are you, scared of the dark?

193
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:42,229
Bet you wish your daddy
never dicked your mama!

194
00:16:42,329 --> 00:16:45,749
Piggy! Pork!
I want me a pork chop.

195
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,577
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

196
00:16:57,677 --> 00:17:01,502
And they don't quit
till they reel someone in.

197
00:17:02,015 --> 00:17:04,015
Hey, Fat Ass.

198
00:17:05,101 --> 00:17:07,101
Fat Ass!

199
00:17:07,604 --> 00:17:09,604
Talk to me, boy.

200
00:17:10,357 --> 00:17:12,843
I know you're there.
I can hear you breathing.

201
00:17:12,943 --> 00:17:16,012
Don't you listen to these nitwits,
you hear me?

202
00:17:16,112 --> 00:17:18,152
This place ain't so bad.

203
00:17:18,448 --> 00:17:20,448
Tell you what...

204
00:17:20,951 --> 00:17:24,521
...I'll introduce you around,
make you feel right at home.

205
00:17:24,621 --> 00:17:27,774
I know a couple of
big old bull queers that'd just...

206
00:17:27,874 --> 00:17:29,901
...love to make your acquaintance.

207
00:17:30,001 --> 00:17:33,613
Especially that big, white,
mushy butt of yours.

208
00:17:33,713 --> 00:17:35,365
God!

209
00:17:35,465 --> 00:17:36,992
I don't belong here!

210
00:17:37,092 --> 00:17:40,078
- We have a winner!
- I want to go home!

211
00:17:40,178 --> 00:17:42,848
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

212
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:47,642
Fresh fish!

213
00:17:53,483 --> 00:17:55,483
I want to go home!

214
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,721
I want my mother!

215
00:17:57,821 --> 00:18:01,221
I had your mother!
She wasn't that great!

216
00:18:04,327 --> 00:18:06,438
What the Christ is this horseshit?

217
00:18:06,538 --> 00:18:08,732
He blasphemed. I'll tell the warden.

218
00:18:08,832 --> 00:18:11,359
You'll tell him with my baton up your ass!

219
00:18:11,459 --> 00:18:12,402
Let me out!

220
00:18:12,502 --> 00:18:15,989
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

221
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:19,149
Please! I ain't supposed to be here.

222
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:20,744
Not me!

223
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:23,288
I won't count to three.
Not even to one.

224
00:18:23,388 --> 00:18:25,832
You shut up,
or I'll sing you a lullaby!

225
00:18:25,932 --> 00:18:28,685
Shut up, man. Shut up!

226
00:18:29,394 --> 00:18:32,172
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here.

227
00:18:32,272 --> 00:18:33,673
Open that cell.

228
00:18:33,773 --> 00:18:38,278
Me neither! They run this place
like a fucking prison!

229
00:18:44,868 --> 00:18:46,868
Son of a bitch!

230
00:18:51,458 --> 00:18:53,793
Captain, take it easy!

231
00:19:16,191 --> 00:19:19,553
If I hear so much as a mouse fart
in here tonight...

232
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:23,473
...I swear by God and Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

233
00:19:23,573 --> 00:19:26,293
Every last motherfucker in here.

234
00:19:29,329 --> 00:19:34,599
Call the trustees. Take that
tub of shit down to the infirmary.

235
00:19:47,347 --> 00:19:52,085
His first night in the joint, Dufresne
cost me two packs of cigarettes.

236
00:19:52,185 --> 00:19:55,188
He never made a sound.

237
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:12,873
Tier 3 north, clear count!

238
00:20:13,790 --> 00:20:16,000
Tier 2 north, clear count.

239
00:20:16,126 --> 00:20:18,461
Tier 3 south, clear.

240
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Prepare to roll out.

241
00:20:28,471 --> 00:20:30,471
Roll out!

242
00:21:23,902 --> 00:21:26,112
Are you going to eat that?

243
00:21:26,696 --> 00:21:29,032
I hadn't planned on it.

244
00:21:30,075 --> 00:21:32,075
Do you mind?

245
00:21:39,876 --> 00:21:41,876
That's nice and ripe.

246
00:21:53,056 --> 00:21:55,100
Jake says thank you.

247
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,340
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

248
00:22:00,230 --> 00:22:04,990
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

249
00:22:05,068 --> 00:22:07,068
Oh, no! Here he comes.

250
00:22:09,865 --> 00:22:11,433
Morning, fellas.

251
00:22:11,533 --> 00:22:13,533
Fine morning, isn't it?

252
00:22:13,785 --> 00:22:16,188
You know why it's a fine morning,
don't you?

253
00:22:16,288 --> 00:22:18,690
Send them down.
I want them lined up...

254
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:22,275
...just like a pretty little chorus line.

255
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,112
Look at that.

256
00:22:24,212 --> 00:22:27,382
- I can't stand this guy.
- Oh, Lord!

257
00:22:28,049 --> 00:22:30,510
Yes! Richmond, Virginia.

258
00:22:30,719 --> 00:22:32,162
Smell my ass!

259
00:22:32,262 --> 00:22:34,264
After he smells mine.

260
00:22:34,723 --> 00:22:38,502
That's a shame about your horse
coming in last and all.

261
00:22:38,602 --> 00:22:41,546
But I sure do love
that winning horse of mine, though.

262
00:22:41,646 --> 00:22:44,716
I owe that boy a big kiss when I see him.

263
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:49,221
Why don't you give him some of your
cigarettes instead? Lucky fuck!

264
00:22:49,321 --> 00:22:51,139
Hey, Tyrell.

265
00:22:51,239 --> 00:22:54,129
You pull infirmary duty this week?

266
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,061
How's my horse doing anyway?

267
00:22:56,161 --> 00:22:58,021
Dead.

268
00:22:58,121 --> 00:23:00,440
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.

269
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:03,151
Doc had gone home for the night.

270
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,612
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

271
00:23:05,712 --> 00:23:09,282
By then, there wasn't nothing we could do.

272
00:23:14,471 --> 00:23:16,471
What was his name?

273
00:23:19,142 --> 00:23:21,142
What'd you say?

274
00:23:22,312 --> 00:23:25,298
I was just wondering
if anyone knew his name.

275
00:23:25,398 --> 00:23:28,458
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

276
00:23:29,152 --> 00:23:33,487
Doesn't fucking matter
what his name was. He's dead.

277
00:23:54,344 --> 00:23:56,384
Anybody come at you yet?

278
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:00,515
Anybody get to you yet?

279
00:24:02,018 --> 00:24:04,823
Hey, we all need friends in here.

280
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:07,150
I could be a friend to you.

281
00:24:15,699 --> 00:24:17,699
Hard to get.

282
00:24:19,202 --> 00:24:21,202
I like that.

283
00:24:27,669 --> 00:24:31,114
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

284
00:24:31,214 --> 00:24:33,533
I guess he had a lot on his mind...

285
00:24:33,633 --> 00:24:37,118
...trying to adapt to life on the inside.

286
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:40,499
Wasn't until a month went by
before he opened his mouth...

287
00:24:40,599 --> 00:24:44,084
...to say more than two words
to somebody.

288
00:24:44,186 --> 00:24:46,186
As it turned out...

289
00:24:46,229 --> 00:24:48,269
...that somebody was me.

290
00:24:56,865 --> 00:24:58,865
I'm Andy Dufresne.

291
00:24:59,868 --> 00:25:01,868
Wife-killing banker.

292
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:05,482
Why'd you do it?

293
00:25:05,582 --> 00:25:07,667
I didn't, since you ask.

294
00:25:08,251 --> 00:25:10,237
You're going to fit right in.

295
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:13,532
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

296
00:25:13,632 --> 00:25:18,222
- What you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

297
00:25:19,888 --> 00:25:22,541
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

298
00:25:22,641 --> 00:25:26,336
You think your shit smells
sweeter than most. Is that right?

299
00:25:26,436 --> 00:25:28,171
What do you think?

300
00:25:28,271 --> 00:25:32,351
To tell you the truth,
I haven't made up my mind.

301
00:25:32,484 --> 00:25:36,179
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

302
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:39,683
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time.

303
00:25:39,783 --> 00:25:42,936
I wonder if you might get me
a rock hammer.

304
00:25:43,036 --> 00:25:44,604
A rock hammer.

305
00:25:44,704 --> 00:25:47,934
- What is it and why?
- What do you care?

306
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,528
For a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask.
I'd quote a price.

307
00:25:51,628 --> 00:25:55,532
But a toothbrush
is a non-lethal object, isn't it?

308
00:25:55,632 --> 00:25:57,367
Fair enough.

309
00:25:57,467 --> 00:26:00,203
A rock hammer is about
six or seven inches long.

310
00:26:00,303 --> 00:26:02,748
- Looks like a miniature pickax.
- Pickax?

311
00:26:02,848 --> 00:26:04,848
For rocks.

312
00:26:06,643 --> 00:26:08,643
Quartz?

313
00:26:11,815 --> 00:26:15,277
And some mica, shale...

314
00:26:16,528 --> 00:26:17,929
...limestone.

315
00:26:18,029 --> 00:26:20,029
So?

316
00:26:20,115 --> 00:26:22,115
So I'm a rock hound.

317
00:26:22,367 --> 00:26:25,645
At least I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again.

318
00:26:25,745 --> 00:26:30,233
Or maybe you'd like to sink your toy
into somebody's skull.

319
00:26:30,333 --> 00:26:32,027
No, I have no enemies here.

320
00:26:32,127 --> 00:26:34,421
No? Wait a while.

321
00:26:36,047 --> 00:26:38,047
Word gets around.

322
00:26:38,341 --> 00:26:42,166
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

323
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,179
Especially Bogs.

324
00:26:45,015 --> 00:26:48,543
Don't suppose it would help if I
told them I'm not homosexual.

325
00:26:48,643 --> 00:26:50,170
Neither are they.

326
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,180
You have to be human first.
They don't qualify.

327
00:26:58,236 --> 00:27:02,766
Bull queers take by force.
That's all they want or understand.

328
00:27:02,866 --> 00:27:06,478
If I were you, I'd grow eyes
in the back of my head.

329
00:27:06,578 --> 00:27:09,606
- Thanks for the advice.
- Well, that's free.

330
00:27:09,706 --> 00:27:11,775
You understand my concern.

331
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:15,278
If there's trouble,
I won't use the rock hammer.

332
00:27:15,378 --> 00:27:20,200
Then I'd guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

333
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:22,285
What did I miss?
What's so funny?

334
00:27:22,385 --> 00:27:26,295
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

335
00:27:26,932 --> 00:27:29,292
What's an item like this usually go for?

336
00:27:29,392 --> 00:27:32,295
Seven dollars in any rock-and-gem shop.

337
00:27:32,395 --> 00:27:34,945
My normal markup's 20 percent.

338
00:27:35,065 --> 00:27:37,530
But this is a specialty item.

339
00:27:37,609 --> 00:27:42,180
Risk goes up, price goes up.
Let's make it an even 10 bucks.

340
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,280
Ten it is.

341
00:27:45,367 --> 00:27:47,561
Waste of money, if you ask me.

342
00:27:47,661 --> 00:27:49,661
Why's that?

343
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:54,537
Folks around this joint
love surprise inspections.

344
00:27:55,001 --> 00:27:57,070
They find it, you're going to lose it.

345
00:27:57,170 --> 00:27:59,364
If they catch you, you don't know me.

346
00:27:59,464 --> 00:28:02,117
Mention my name, we never
do business again.

347
00:28:02,217 --> 00:28:06,037
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now you got that?

348
00:28:06,137 --> 00:28:08,137
I understand.

349
00:28:08,932 --> 00:28:11,017
Thank you, Mr...

350
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:12,878
Red.

351
00:28:12,978 --> 00:28:14,978
Name's Red.

352
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,940
Why do they call you that?

353
00:28:21,111 --> 00:28:23,576
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

354
00:28:31,288 --> 00:28:34,941
I could see why some of the boys
took him for snobby.

355
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:37,676
He had a quiet way about him...

356
00:28:37,794 --> 00:28:42,199
...a walk and a talk that just
wasn't normal around here.

357
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:43,867
He strolled...

358
00:28:43,967 --> 00:28:48,288
...like a man in the park without a care
or a worry in the world.

359
00:28:48,388 --> 00:28:54,338
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

360
00:28:54,978 --> 00:28:57,380
I think it'd be fair to say...

361
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,115
...I liked Andy from the start.

362
00:29:01,276 --> 00:29:05,071
Let's go! Some of us
got a schedule to keep.

363
00:29:08,408 --> 00:29:10,911
Move it! Come on, move it!

364
00:29:13,496 --> 00:29:17,066
How you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

365
00:29:54,579 --> 00:29:56,189
Andy was right.

366
00:29:56,289 --> 00:29:58,542
I finally got the joke.

367
00:29:58,833 --> 00:30:01,319
It would take a man about 600 years...

368
00:30:01,419 --> 00:30:05,329
...to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

369
00:30:07,676 --> 00:30:10,095
- Book?
- Not today.

370
00:30:16,142 --> 00:30:18,142
Book?

371
00:30:24,484 --> 00:30:26,653
Delivery for Dufresne.

372
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:46,337
Here's your book.

373
00:30:50,927 --> 00:30:52,927
Thanks.

374
00:30:58,435 --> 00:31:03,620
We're running low on hexite.
Get on back and fetch us up some.

375
00:31:39,476 --> 00:31:41,294
This will blind you.

376
00:31:41,394 --> 00:31:43,813
Honey, hush.

377
00:31:56,326 --> 00:31:58,328
That's it. You fight!

378
00:31:58,495 --> 00:32:00,495
Better that way.

379
00:32:08,213 --> 00:32:11,408
I wish I could tell you
Andy fought the good fight...

380
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:14,058
...and the Sisters let him be.

381
00:32:14,094 --> 00:32:16,037
I wish I could tell you that...

382
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:19,282
...but prison is no fairy-tale world.

383
00:32:20,225 --> 00:32:22,350
He never said who did it.

384
00:32:22,435 --> 00:32:24,435
But we all knew.

385
00:32:28,859 --> 00:32:31,678
Things went on like that for a while.

386
00:32:31,778 --> 00:32:34,431
Prison life consists of routine...

387
00:32:34,531 --> 00:32:36,656
...and then more routine.

388
00:32:39,035 --> 00:32:43,540
Every so often, Andy would show up
with fresh bruises.

389
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,080
The Sisters kept at him.

390
00:32:46,084 --> 00:32:48,278
Sometimes he was able to fight them off.

391
00:32:48,378 --> 00:32:50,378
Sometimes not.

392
00:32:51,047 --> 00:32:53,658
And that's how it went for Andy.

393
00:32:53,758 --> 00:32:55,758
That was his routine.

394
00:32:56,386 --> 00:33:00,207
I do believe those first two years
were the worst for him.

395
00:33:00,307 --> 00:33:03,919
And I also believe that
if things had gone on that way...

396
00:33:04,019 --> 00:33:07,130
...this place would have got the best of him.

397
00:33:07,230 --> 00:33:10,120
But then, in the spring of 1949...

398
00:33:10,233 --> 00:33:12,219
...the powers that be decided:

399
00:33:12,319 --> 00:33:15,764
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

400
00:33:15,864 --> 00:33:19,519
I need a dozen volunteers
for a week's work.

401
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:21,743
As you know...

402
00:33:21,953 --> 00:33:25,649
...special detail carries with it
special privileges.

403
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:28,126
It was outdoor detail...

404
00:33:28,543 --> 00:33:32,948
...and May is one damned fine month
to be working outdoors.

405
00:33:33,048 --> 00:33:34,491
Stay in line there.

406
00:33:34,591 --> 00:33:38,586
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

407
00:33:42,015 --> 00:33:45,018
Wallace E. Unger.

408
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,896
Ellis Redding.

409
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:50,104
Wouldn't you know it?

410
00:33:50,106 --> 00:33:53,510
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names called.

411
00:33:53,610 --> 00:33:55,610
Andrew Dufresne.

412
00:33:55,987 --> 00:33:59,349
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

413
00:33:59,449 --> 00:34:02,018
I made my usual 20 percent, of course.

414
00:34:02,118 --> 00:34:05,689
So this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

415
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:07,524
I say, "Yeah?"

416
00:34:07,624 --> 00:34:11,361
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died. "

417
00:34:11,461 --> 00:34:15,449
- I'm sorry to hear that.
- I'm not. He was an asshole.

418
00:34:15,549 --> 00:34:17,868
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead.

419
00:34:17,968 --> 00:34:20,370
So this lawyer fellow says to me:

420
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:25,167
"He died a rich man. " Oil wells
and shit. Close to a million bucks.

421
00:34:25,267 --> 00:34:27,267
A million bucks?

422
00:34:27,435 --> 00:34:32,424
- Incredible how lucky some assholes get.
- You going to see any of that?

423
00:34:32,524 --> 00:34:35,385
Thirty-five thousand.
That's what he left me.

424
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:37,345
Dollars?

425
00:34:37,445 --> 00:34:40,682
That's great! That's like
winning the sweepstakes.

426
00:34:40,782 --> 00:34:41,975
Isn't it?

427
00:34:42,075 --> 00:34:45,145
Dumb shit, what do you think
the government will do to me?

428
00:34:45,245 --> 00:34:48,273
Take a big wet bite out of my ass is what.

429
00:34:48,373 --> 00:34:50,373
Poor Byron.

430
00:34:50,625 --> 00:34:53,904
Terrible fucking luck, huh?
Crying shame.

431
00:34:54,004 --> 00:34:56,406
Some people really got it awful.

432
00:34:56,506 --> 00:34:57,991
Andy, are you nuts?

433
00:34:58,091 --> 00:35:00,077
Keep your eyes on your mop, man!

434
00:35:00,177 --> 00:35:03,246
You'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up-

435
00:35:03,346 --> 00:35:06,249
Yeah, maybe enough to buy
a new car, and then what?

436
00:35:06,349 --> 00:35:08,668
I got to pay tax on the car. Repair...

437
00:35:08,768 --> 00:35:12,631
...maintenance, kids pestering you
to take them for a ride all the time.

438
00:35:12,731 --> 00:35:16,510
Then if you figure your tax wrong,
you pay out of your own pocket.

439
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,737
I tell you! Uncle Sam!

440
00:35:18,987 --> 00:35:24,852
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

441
00:35:25,619 --> 00:35:27,938
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

442
00:35:28,038 --> 00:35:30,540
Some brother.
Shit!

443
00:35:35,504 --> 00:35:37,504
Mr. Hadley...

444
00:35:37,756 --> 00:35:39,966
...do you trust your wife?

445
00:35:40,759 --> 00:35:42,759
Oh, that's funny.

446
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:45,497
You'll look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

447
00:35:45,597 --> 00:35:49,960
What I mean is, do you think
she'd go behind your back?

448
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:53,588
Step aside, Mert. This fucker's
having himself an accident.

449
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:54,840
He'll push him off!

450
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:56,925
If you trust her, you can keep...

451
00:35:57,025 --> 00:35:59,025
...that 35,000.

452
00:35:59,152 --> 00:36:02,389
- What did you say?
- Thirty-five thousand.

453
00:36:02,489 --> 00:36:03,640
All of it.

454
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:06,893
- Every penny.
- You better start making sense.

455
00:36:06,993 --> 00:36:09,438
If you want to keep it,
give it to your wife.

456
00:36:09,538 --> 00:36:13,525
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

457
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:16,175
- Bullshit. Tax-free?
- Tax-free.

458
00:36:16,211 --> 00:36:18,336
IRS can't touch one cent.

459
00:36:18,588 --> 00:36:21,158
You're that smart banker
that killed his wife.

460
00:36:21,258 --> 00:36:24,745
Why should I believe you?
So I can end up in here with you?

461
00:36:24,845 --> 00:36:27,789
It's legal. Ask the IRS.
They'll say the same thing.

462
00:36:27,889 --> 00:36:32,043
I feel stupid telling you this.
I'm sure you would have investigated.

463
00:36:32,143 --> 00:36:35,922
I don't need you to tell me
where the bear shit in the buckwheat.

464
00:36:36,022 --> 00:36:39,509
Of course not. But you do need
someone to set it up for you.

465
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:41,303
That'll cost you. A lawyer.

466
00:36:41,403 --> 00:36:44,014
A bunch of ball-washing bastards!

467
00:36:44,114 --> 00:36:47,684
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

468
00:36:47,784 --> 00:36:50,020
You get the forms, I'll prepare them...

469
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:52,245
...nearly free of charge.

470
00:36:53,081 --> 00:36:57,235
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my coworkers.

471
00:36:57,335 --> 00:36:59,460
"Coworkers. " That's rich!

472
00:36:59,713 --> 00:37:02,365
A man working outdoors
feels more like a man...

473
00:37:02,465 --> 00:37:06,244
...if he can have a bottle of suds.
That's only my opinion...

474
00:37:06,344 --> 00:37:08,344
...sir.

475
00:37:11,308 --> 00:37:13,335
What are you jimmies staring at?

476
00:37:13,435 --> 00:37:15,435
Let's go! Work!

477
00:37:24,529 --> 00:37:26,556
And that's how it came to pass...

478
00:37:26,656 --> 00:37:29,434
...that on the second-to-last day of the job...

479
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:34,231
...the convict crew that tarred
the factory roof in the spring of '49...

480
00:37:34,331 --> 00:37:37,567
...wound up sitting in a row
at 10:00 in the morning...

481
00:37:37,667 --> 00:37:43,131
...drinking icy-cold beer,
courtesy of the hardest screw...

482
00:37:43,340 --> 00:37:46,701
...that ever walked a turn
at Shawshank State Prison.

483
00:37:46,801 --> 00:37:49,606
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

484
00:37:50,347 --> 00:37:54,893
The colossal prick even managed
to sound magnanimous.

485
00:37:56,019 --> 00:38:00,757
We sat and drank with the sun
on our shoulders and felt like free men.

486
00:38:00,857 --> 00:38:04,428
We could have been tarring
the roof of one of our own houses.

487
00:38:04,528 --> 00:38:07,418
We were the lords of all creation.

488
00:38:07,906 --> 00:38:09,641
As for Andy...

489
00:38:09,741 --> 00:38:12,477
...he spent that break
hunkered in the shade...

490
00:38:12,577 --> 00:38:15,230
...a strange little smile on his face...

491
00:38:15,330 --> 00:38:17,880
...watching us drink his beer.

492
00:38:25,632 --> 00:38:27,632
Want a cold one?

493
00:38:27,676 --> 00:38:30,595
No, thanks. I gave up drinking.

494
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:38,253
You could argue he done it
to curry favor with the guards.

495
00:38:38,353 --> 00:38:42,148
Or maybe make a few friends
among us cons.

496
00:38:42,899 --> 00:38:44,050
Me?

497
00:38:44,150 --> 00:38:47,304
I think he did it just to feel normal again...

498
00:38:47,404 --> 00:38:49,869
...if only for a short while.

499
00:38:52,242 --> 00:38:54,242
King me.

500
00:38:55,245 --> 00:38:57,981
- Chess. Now there's a game of kings.
- What?

501
00:38:58,081 --> 00:39:00,081
Civilized. Strategic.

502
00:39:00,458 --> 00:39:03,688
And a total fucking mystery.
I hate it.

503
00:39:03,753 --> 00:39:05,878
Let me teach you someday.

504
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,408
Sure.

505
00:39:08,508 --> 00:39:10,368
We could get a board together.

506
00:39:10,468 --> 00:39:13,663
You're talking to the right man.
I can get things, right?

507
00:39:13,763 --> 00:39:17,834
We might do business on a board,
and I'll carve the pieces myself.

508
00:39:17,934 --> 00:39:21,755
One side in alabaster, one in soapstone.
What do you think?

509
00:39:21,855 --> 00:39:23,340
I think it'll take years.

510
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:26,093
Years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

511
00:39:26,193 --> 00:39:28,261
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

512
00:39:28,361 --> 00:39:30,361
Pebbles, mostly.

513
00:39:34,534 --> 00:39:38,105
We're getting to be
kind of friends, aren't we?

514
00:39:38,205 --> 00:39:40,205
Yeah, I guess.

515
00:39:40,415 --> 00:39:42,455
Can I ask you something?

516
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:45,418
Why'd you do it?

517
00:39:46,087 --> 00:39:47,739
I'm innocent, Red.

518
00:39:47,839 --> 00:39:50,389
Just like everybody else here.

519
00:39:54,221 --> 00:39:56,221
What are you in for?

520
00:39:58,475 --> 00:40:00,644
Murder. Same as you.

521
00:40:00,852 --> 00:40:02,852
Innocent?

522
00:40:04,731 --> 00:40:07,196
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

523
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,070
Where's the canary?

524
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,571
How did you know?

525
00:41:09,671 --> 00:41:12,074
- How did I know what?
- So you don't know.

526
00:41:12,174 --> 00:41:14,174
Come.

527
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:18,224
This is where the canary is.

528
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:25,359
Quite a surprise to hear
a woman singing in my house, eh?

529
00:41:27,439 --> 00:41:29,439
That's quite a...

530
00:41:29,774 --> 00:41:31,774
...surprise.

531
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:37,599
Wait, wait.

532
00:41:37,699 --> 00:41:39,351
Here she comes.

533
00:41:39,451 --> 00:41:42,437
I like this part when she
does that shit with her hair.

534
00:41:42,537 --> 00:41:45,357
I know. I've seen it three times this month.

535
00:41:45,457 --> 00:41:47,457
Gilda, are you decent?

536
00:41:48,376 --> 00:41:50,376
Me?

537
00:41:52,214 --> 00:41:54,214
God, I love it.

538
00:41:59,137 --> 00:42:03,041
I understand you're a man
that knows how to get things.

539
00:42:03,141 --> 00:42:07,003
I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

540
00:42:07,103 --> 00:42:09,231
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

541
00:42:09,773 --> 00:42:11,773
Can you get her?

542
00:42:12,567 --> 00:42:16,987
So this is Johnny Farrel.
I've heard a lot about you.

543
00:42:17,155 --> 00:42:19,449
- Take a few weeks.
- Weeks?

544
00:42:19,658 --> 00:42:24,521
I don't have her stuffed down the front
of my pants right now, sorry to say.

545
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:26,064
But I'll get her.

546
00:42:26,164 --> 00:42:28,164
Relax.

547
00:42:29,376 --> 00:42:31,376
Thanks.

548
00:42:51,273 --> 00:42:53,175
- Get out!
- I got to change reels!

549
00:42:53,275 --> 00:42:55,277
I said fuck off!

550
00:43:01,408 --> 00:43:03,618
Ain't you going to scream?

551
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:06,244
Let's get this over with.

552
00:43:11,084 --> 00:43:13,209
He broke my fucking nose!

553
00:43:22,387 --> 00:43:23,997
Now...

554
00:43:24,097 --> 00:43:26,416
...I'm going to open my fly...

555
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:30,337
...and you'll swallow
what I give you to swallow.

556
00:43:30,437 --> 00:43:33,131
Then you'll swallow Rooster's.
You broke his nose.

557
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:35,467
He ought to have something to show for it.

558
00:43:35,567 --> 00:43:37,552
You put it in my mouth,
you lose it.

559
00:43:37,652 --> 00:43:40,238
No, you don't understand.

560
00:43:40,572 --> 00:43:43,725
Do that and I'll put all eight inches
of this in your ear.

561
00:43:43,825 --> 00:43:47,395
All right, but you should know
that sudden, serious brain injury...

562
00:43:47,495 --> 00:43:49,523
...causes the victim to bite down hard.

563
00:43:49,623 --> 00:43:53,618
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong...

564
00:43:53,919 --> 00:43:56,488
...they have to pry the victim's jaws open...

565
00:43:56,588 --> 00:43:58,588
...with a crowbar.

566
00:44:00,926 --> 00:44:02,577
Where do you get this shit?

567
00:44:02,677 --> 00:44:04,677
I read it.

568
00:44:05,472 --> 00:44:08,787
You know how to read,
you ignorant fuck?

569
00:44:09,809 --> 00:44:11,809
Honey!

570
00:44:12,854 --> 00:44:14,854
You shouldn't!

571
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:20,303
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth.

572
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:22,783
And neither did his friends.

573
00:44:22,906 --> 00:44:27,310
What they did do is beat him
within an inch of his life.

574
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,470
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

575
00:44:30,747 --> 00:44:33,297
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

576
00:44:37,337 --> 00:44:39,337
Time's up, Bogs.

577
00:44:42,676 --> 00:44:44,676
It's your world, boss.

578
00:44:47,597 --> 00:44:50,500
Return to your cellblocks for evening count.

579
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:53,575
All prisoners report for lock down.

580
00:45:08,201 --> 00:45:10,201
What?

581
00:45:21,882 --> 00:45:24,857
- Where's he going?
- Grab his ankles.

582
00:45:30,223 --> 00:45:32,223
Help!

583
00:45:35,145 --> 00:45:37,923
Two things never happened again
after that.

584
00:45:38,023 --> 00:45:41,848
The Sisters never
laid a finger on Andy again.

585
00:45:41,985 --> 00:45:44,705
And Bogs would never walk again.

586
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:49,267
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

587
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:52,229
To my knowledge, he lived out
the rest of his days...

588
00:45:52,329 --> 00:45:55,065
...drinking his food through a straw.

589
00:45:55,165 --> 00:46:00,945
Andy could use a nice welcome back
when he gets out of the infirmary.

590
00:46:01,004 --> 00:46:02,739
Sounds good to us.

591
00:46:02,839 --> 00:46:05,992
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

592
00:46:06,092 --> 00:46:08,472
The man likes to play chess.

593
00:46:08,845 --> 00:46:10,970
Let's get him some rocks.

594
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,380
Guys!

595
00:46:45,382 --> 00:46:46,575
I got one.

596
00:46:46,675 --> 00:46:48,675
I got one. Look!

597
00:46:50,053 --> 00:46:54,249
Heywood, that isn't soapstone!
And it ain't alabaster either.

598
00:46:54,349 --> 00:46:56,334
What are you, a fucking geologist?

599
00:46:56,434 --> 00:46:58,295
He's right. It ain't.

600
00:46:58,395 --> 00:47:02,132
- What the hell is it then?
- It's a horse apple.

601
00:47:02,232 --> 00:47:04,651
- Bullshit!
- No, horseshit.

602
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,860
Petrified.

603
00:47:15,328 --> 00:47:16,730
Damn!

604
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:21,151
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

605
00:47:21,251 --> 00:47:23,361
And by the weekend he was due back...

606
00:47:23,461 --> 00:47:27,908
...we had enough rocks saved up
to keep him busy till rapture.

607
00:47:28,008 --> 00:47:30,660
Also got a big shipment in that week.

608
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:31,995
Cigarettes...

609
00:47:32,095 --> 00:47:33,246
...chewing gum...

610
00:47:33,346 --> 00:47:34,915
...sipping whisky...

611
00:47:35,015 --> 00:47:38,502
...playing cards with naked ladies
on them. You name it.

612
00:47:38,602 --> 00:47:41,917
And of course, the most important item:

613
00:47:43,231 --> 00:47:45,275
Rita Hayworth herself.

614
00:48:22,395 --> 00:48:24,756
Heads up.
They're tossing cells.

615
00:48:24,856 --> 00:48:27,567
Heads up.
They're tossing cells!

616
00:48:29,152 --> 00:48:31,152
119.

617
00:48:32,489 --> 00:48:34,489
123.

618
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:46,626
On your feet.

619
00:48:48,088 --> 00:48:50,088
Face the wall.

620
00:49:23,707 --> 00:49:26,427
Turn around and face the warden.

621
00:49:32,215 --> 00:49:34,935
Pleased to see you reading this.

622
00:49:35,635 --> 00:49:37,635
Any favorite passages?

623
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:40,916
"Watch ye, therefore,
for ye know not...

624
00:49:41,016 --> 00:49:44,294
...when the master of the house cometh. "

625
00:49:44,394 --> 00:49:46,521
Mark 13:35.

626
00:49:47,272 --> 00:49:49,567
I've always liked that one.

627
00:49:50,066 --> 00:49:52,066
But I prefer...

628
00:49:52,235 --> 00:49:54,471
..."I am the light of the world.

629
00:49:54,571 --> 00:49:57,974
Ye that followeth me
shall have the light of life. "

630
00:49:58,074 --> 00:50:00,702
John, chapter 8, verse 12.

631
00:50:00,952 --> 00:50:03,105
I hear you're good with numbers.

632
00:50:03,205 --> 00:50:05,205
How nice.

633
00:50:05,415 --> 00:50:07,455
Man should have a skill.

634
00:50:09,920 --> 00:50:11,920
Explain this.

635
00:50:12,088 --> 00:50:16,493
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

636
00:50:16,593 --> 00:50:18,593
A little hobby of mine.

637
00:50:29,397 --> 00:50:31,007
It's pretty clean.

638
00:50:31,107 --> 00:50:35,867
Some contraband here,
but nothing to get in a twist over.

639
00:50:38,532 --> 00:50:41,082
I can't say I approve of this.

640
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:44,160
But I suppose...

641
00:50:45,705 --> 00:50:47,915
...exceptions can be made.

642
00:50:58,093 --> 00:51:00,093
Lock them up!

643
00:51:02,305 --> 00:51:04,305
I almost forgot.

644
00:51:04,307 --> 00:51:07,027
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

645
00:51:07,227 --> 00:51:09,227
Salvation lies within.

646
00:51:09,354 --> 00:51:11,354
Yes, sir.

647
00:51:18,989 --> 00:51:21,794
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

648
00:51:21,992 --> 00:51:23,351
Truth is...

649
00:51:23,451 --> 00:51:26,256
...Norton wanted to size Andy up.

650
00:51:39,593 --> 00:51:42,483
My wife made that in church group.

651
00:51:44,598 --> 00:51:46,598
Very nice, sir.

652
00:51:47,475 --> 00:51:50,025
You enjoy working the laundry?

653
00:51:50,604 --> 00:51:52,644
No, sir. Not especially.

654
00:51:52,647 --> 00:51:55,258
Perhaps we can find something more...

655
00:51:55,358 --> 00:51:58,503
...befitting a man of your education.

656
00:52:05,869 --> 00:52:07,994
Hey, Jake.
Where's Brooks?

657
00:52:09,206 --> 00:52:11,958
I thought I heard you out here.

658
00:52:12,626 --> 00:52:14,361
I've been reassigned to you.

659
00:52:14,461 --> 00:52:16,796
I know, they told me.

660
00:52:17,631 --> 00:52:19,783
Ain't that a kick in the head?

661
00:52:19,883 --> 00:52:22,285
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

662
00:52:22,385 --> 00:52:24,385
Come on.

663
00:52:24,971 --> 00:52:26,790
Well, here she is.

664
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:29,355
The Shawshank Prison Library.

665
00:52:29,559 --> 00:52:31,561
National Geographics...

666
00:52:32,479 --> 00:52:35,382
...Reader's Digest condensed books...

667
00:52:35,482 --> 00:52:37,482
...and Louis L'Amour.

668
00:52:37,651 --> 00:52:39,651
Look magazine.

669
00:52:39,819 --> 00:52:42,155
Erle Stanley Gardners.

670
00:52:42,405 --> 00:52:45,976
Every evening I load up the cart
and make my rounds.

671
00:52:46,076 --> 00:52:49,146
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

672
00:52:49,246 --> 00:52:51,998
Easy, peasy, Japanese-y.

673
00:52:52,749 --> 00:52:56,737
- Any questions?
- How long have you been librarian?

674
00:52:56,837 --> 00:53:01,427
I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

675
00:53:02,175 --> 00:53:04,494
And have you ever had an assistant?

676
00:53:04,594 --> 00:53:07,013
No. Not much to it, really.

677
00:53:07,764 --> 00:53:09,332
Why me? Why now?

678
00:53:09,432 --> 00:53:10,834
I don't know.

679
00:53:10,934 --> 00:53:14,929
But it'd be nice to have
some company down here.

680
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,534
That's him.
That's the one.

681
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:36,651
I'm Dekins.

682
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:38,751
I was thinking...

683
00:53:39,045 --> 00:53:44,740
...about setting up some kind of
trust fund for my kids' educations.

684
00:53:46,803 --> 00:53:48,803
I see.

685
00:53:53,393 --> 00:53:56,963
Why don't we have a seat and talk it over.

686
00:53:59,566 --> 00:54:03,136
Do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

687
00:54:13,872 --> 00:54:15,732
Thanks.

688
00:54:15,832 --> 00:54:17,832
So...

689
00:54:18,668 --> 00:54:20,668
Mister Dekins...

690
00:54:21,254 --> 00:54:23,448
And then Andy says, "Mr. Dekins...

691
00:54:23,548 --> 00:54:26,660
...do you want your sons
to go to Harvard or Yale?"

692
00:54:26,760 --> 00:54:28,078
He didn't say that!

693
00:54:28,178 --> 00:54:30,639
As God as my witness!

694
00:54:30,931 --> 00:54:32,749
Dekins blinked for a second...

695
00:54:32,849 --> 00:54:36,336
...then he laughed
and actually shook Andy's hand.

696
00:54:36,436 --> 00:54:38,688
- My ass!
- Shook his hand.

697
00:54:38,939 --> 00:54:41,858
I tell you, I near soiled myself!

698
00:54:42,025 --> 00:54:46,430
All he needed was a suit and tie
and a jiggly hula gal on his desk...

699
00:54:46,530 --> 00:54:49,224
...he'd have been
"Mr. Dufresne," if you please.

700
00:54:49,324 --> 00:54:51,324
Making a few friends?

701
00:54:52,244 --> 00:54:54,020
I wouldn't say "friends. "

702
00:54:54,120 --> 00:54:58,066
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

703
00:54:58,166 --> 00:55:00,631
It's a wonderful pet to have.

704
00:55:00,710 --> 00:55:02,946
Got you out of the laundry, though.

705
00:55:03,046 --> 00:55:05,073
It might do more than that.

706
00:55:05,173 --> 00:55:07,951
How about expanding the library.
Get some new books.

707
00:55:08,051 --> 00:55:11,961
If you ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

708
00:55:12,389 --> 00:55:15,459
How do you expect to do that?
I mean...

709
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:18,920
...get new books in here,
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please. "

710
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:21,570
I'll ask the warden for funds.

711
00:55:21,940 --> 00:55:26,344
Six wardens have been through here
in my tenure, and I've learned...

712
00:55:26,444 --> 00:55:28,889
...one immutable, universal truth:

713
00:55:28,989 --> 00:55:30,474
Not one born whose asshole...

714
00:55:30,574 --> 00:55:36,313
...wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you ask for funds.

715
00:55:36,413 --> 00:55:39,399
- The budget's stretched thin as it is.
- I see.

716
00:55:39,499 --> 00:55:43,028
Maybe I could write the state senate
and request funds from them.

717
00:55:43,128 --> 00:55:47,324
They have only three ways to spend
the taxpayers' money for prisons:

718
00:55:47,424 --> 00:55:49,993
More walls, more bars, more guards.

719
00:55:50,093 --> 00:55:52,829
I'd like to try, with permission.
A letter a week.

720
00:55:52,929 --> 00:55:55,832
- They can't ignore me forever.
- Sure can.

721
00:55:55,932 --> 00:55:58,835
But you write your letters
if it makes you happy.

722
00:55:58,935 --> 00:56:02,250
I'll even mail them for you.
How's that?

723
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:06,093
So Andy started writing a letter a week...

724
00:56:06,193 --> 00:56:08,193
...just like he said.

725
00:56:11,948 --> 00:56:14,576
And like Norton said...

726
00:56:14,784 --> 00:56:16,784
...Andy got no answers.

727
00:56:24,461 --> 00:56:30,581
The following April, he did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

728
00:56:30,717 --> 00:56:33,120
Year after that, he did them all...

729
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,430
...including the warden's.

730
00:56:36,890 --> 00:56:40,460
Year after that, they
rescheduled the intramural season...

731
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,195
...to coincide with tax season.

732
00:56:44,564 --> 00:56:49,136
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

733
00:56:49,236 --> 00:56:50,679
So Moresby Prison...

734
00:56:50,779 --> 00:56:53,181
...issued you a gun,
but you paid for it.

735
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:55,058
Right. The holster too.

736
00:56:55,158 --> 00:56:57,727
That's tax-deductible.
You can write that off.

737
00:56:57,827 --> 00:57:01,481
Yes, sir!
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

738
00:57:01,581 --> 00:57:06,236
In fact, it got so busy at tax time,
he was allowed a staff.

739
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:08,905
Could you hand me a stack of 1040s?

740
00:57:09,005 --> 00:57:14,995
Got me out of the wood shop a month out
of the year, and that was fine by me.

741
00:57:15,095 --> 00:57:18,580
And still, he kept sending those letters.

742
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:27,021
It's Brooks.

743
00:57:27,190 --> 00:57:28,842
Watch the door.

744
00:57:28,942 --> 00:57:30,427
Please, Brooks.

745
00:57:30,527 --> 00:57:32,679
- Calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

746
00:57:32,779 --> 00:57:35,515
- Stay back, goddamn it!
- What's going on?

747
00:57:35,615 --> 00:57:38,268
One second he's fine,
then out come the knives.

748
00:57:38,368 --> 00:57:40,353
We can talk about this, right?

749
00:57:40,453 --> 00:57:44,357
There's nothing to talk about.
I'll cut his fucking throat.

750
00:57:44,457 --> 00:57:46,276
What's he done to you?

751
00:57:46,376 --> 00:57:48,376
It's what they done!

752
00:57:48,545 --> 00:57:50,197
I got no choice.

753
00:57:50,297 --> 00:57:52,699
You won't hurt Heywood.
We all know that.

754
00:57:52,799 --> 00:57:55,260
- Right, Heywood?
- Sure.

755
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:58,997
He's a friend of yours,
and Brooks is a reasonable man.

756
00:57:59,097 --> 00:58:01,097
Right, guys?

757
00:58:01,141 --> 00:58:03,794
So put the knife down.
Look at me.

758
00:58:03,894 --> 00:58:06,146
Put the knife down.

759
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:10,869
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

760
00:58:10,901 --> 00:58:13,621
Look at his neck. He's bleeding.

761
00:58:14,154 --> 00:58:15,722
It's the only way...

762
00:58:15,822 --> 00:58:17,866
...they'd let me stay.

763
00:58:18,158 --> 00:58:20,644
This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

764
00:58:20,744 --> 00:58:22,829
Put it, put it down.

765
00:58:31,588 --> 00:58:33,588
Take it easy.

766
00:58:33,757 --> 00:58:35,757
You'll be all right.

767
00:58:36,384 --> 00:58:38,078
Him? What about me?

768
00:58:38,178 --> 00:58:40,664
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat!

769
00:58:40,764 --> 00:58:42,791
You've had worse from shaving.

770
00:58:42,891 --> 00:58:45,085
What did you do to set him off?

771
00:58:45,185 --> 00:58:47,921
Nothing.
I come in here to say farewell.

772
00:58:48,021 --> 00:58:51,591
Ain't you heard?
His parole's come through.

773
00:58:53,026 --> 00:58:55,929
I just don't understand
what happened in there.

774
00:58:56,029 --> 00:58:58,932
Old man's crazy as a rat in a tin shithouse.

775
00:58:59,032 --> 00:59:01,017
That's enough out of you.

776
00:59:01,117 --> 00:59:04,020
- Heard he had you shitting your pants.
- Fuck you.

777
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,120
Knock it off.

778
00:59:06,289 --> 00:59:08,289
Brooks ain't no bug.

779
00:59:11,586 --> 00:59:13,966
He's just institutionalized.

780
00:59:14,714 --> 00:59:16,742
"Institutionalized," my ass.

781
00:59:16,842 --> 00:59:20,954
The man's been in here 50 years,
Heywood, 50 years!

782
00:59:21,054 --> 00:59:22,873
This is all he knows.

783
00:59:22,973 --> 00:59:25,375
In here, he's an important man...

784
00:59:25,475 --> 00:59:27,294
...an educated man.

785
00:59:27,394 --> 00:59:29,394
Outside, he's nothing.

786
00:59:30,188 --> 00:59:33,800
Just a used-up con
with arthritis in both hands.

787
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:37,053
Probably couldn't get a library card
if he tried.

788
00:59:37,153 --> 00:59:39,055
You know what I'm trying to say?

789
00:59:39,155 --> 00:59:42,895
I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

790
00:59:43,326 --> 00:59:45,876
You believe whatever you want.

791
00:59:46,162 --> 00:59:49,307
But I tell you these walls are funny.

792
00:59:50,166 --> 00:59:52,166
First you hate them.

793
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:55,880
Then you get used to them.

794
00:59:57,507 --> 00:59:59,509
Enough time passes...

795
01:00:00,177 --> 01:00:02,982
...you get so you depend on them.

796
01:00:03,180 --> 01:00:05,475
That's "institutionalized. "

797
01:00:05,599 --> 01:00:07,000
Shit.

798
01:00:07,100 --> 01:00:10,415
- I could never get like that.
- Oh, yeah?

799
01:00:10,729 --> 01:00:13,381
Wait till you've been here
as long as Brooks.

800
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:15,481
Goddamn right.

801
01:00:17,611 --> 01:00:20,161
They send you here for life...

802
01:00:20,197 --> 01:00:23,002
...that's exactly what they take.

803
01:00:24,284 --> 01:00:26,409
Part that counts, anyway.

804
01:00:33,877 --> 01:00:37,192
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

805
01:00:38,006 --> 01:00:40,006
You go on now.

806
01:00:40,884 --> 01:00:42,884
You're free.

807
01:00:43,678 --> 01:00:45,678
You're free.

808
01:01:04,241 --> 01:01:06,241
Good luck, Brooksie.

809
01:01:43,905 --> 01:01:45,557
Dear fellas:

810
01:01:45,657 --> 01:01:49,992
I can't believe how fast things move
on the outside.

811
01:01:51,162 --> 01:01:54,477
Watch it, old-timer!
Want to get killed?

812
01:01:55,083 --> 01:01:58,738
I saw an automobile once
when I was a kid...

813
01:01:59,212 --> 01:02:01,762
...but now they're everywhere.

814
01:02:05,302 --> 01:02:09,639
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

815
01:02:25,447 --> 01:02:29,392
The parole board
got me into this halfway house...

816
01:02:29,492 --> 01:02:31,269
...called "The Brewer"...

817
01:02:31,369 --> 01:02:32,646
...and a job...

818
01:02:32,746 --> 01:02:35,891
...bagging groceries at the Food-Way.

819
01:02:37,250 --> 01:02:39,778
It's hard work and I try to keep up...

820
01:02:39,878 --> 01:02:42,447
...but my hands hurt most of the time.

821
01:02:42,547 --> 01:02:44,616
Make sure your man double-bags.

822
01:02:44,716 --> 01:02:47,327
Last time, the bottom near came out.

823
01:02:47,427 --> 01:02:50,455
Make sure you double-bag
like the lady says. Understand?

824
01:02:50,555 --> 01:02:52,040
Yes, sir. Surely will.

825
01:02:52,140 --> 01:02:56,390
I don't think the store manager
likes me very much.

826
01:02:58,688 --> 01:03:03,301
Sometimes after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

827
01:03:03,401 --> 01:03:05,053
I keep thinking...

828
01:03:05,153 --> 01:03:08,638
...Jake might just show up and say hello.

829
01:03:09,074 --> 01:03:11,076
But he never does.

830
01:03:12,285 --> 01:03:17,555
I hope, wherever he is, he's doing okay
and making new friends.

831
01:03:20,752 --> 01:03:23,557
I have trouble sleeping at night.

832
01:03:23,797 --> 01:03:27,050
I have bad dreams like I'm falling.

833
01:03:27,342 --> 01:03:29,553
I wake up scared.

834
01:03:29,761 --> 01:03:34,181
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

835
01:03:35,517 --> 01:03:40,630
Maybe I should get a gun and rob
the Food-Way so they'd send me home.

836
01:03:40,730 --> 01:03:46,255
I could shoot the manager while
I was at it. Sort of like a bonus.

837
01:03:46,736 --> 01:03:50,849
I guess I'm too old
for that sort of nonsense anymore.

838
01:03:50,949 --> 01:03:52,809
I don't like it here.

839
01:03:52,909 --> 01:03:57,499
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.
I've decided...

840
01:03:57,747 --> 01:03:59,747
...not to stay.

841
01:04:10,302 --> 01:04:12,996
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss...

842
01:04:13,096 --> 01:04:16,558
...not for an old crook like me.

843
01:05:19,037 --> 01:05:24,234
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss,
not for an old crook like me.

844
01:05:24,334 --> 01:05:28,280
P.S. Tell Heywood I'm sorry
I put a knife to his throat.

845
01:05:28,380 --> 01:05:30,715
No hard feelings. Brooks. "

846
01:05:41,184 --> 01:05:43,564
He should have died in here.

847
01:05:48,692 --> 01:05:50,218
What the fuck have you done?

848
01:05:50,318 --> 01:05:53,633
It's a goddamn mess,
I'll tell you that.

849
01:05:58,535 --> 01:06:03,295
- What's all this?
- You tell me. They're addressed to you.

850
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:05,540
Take it.

851
01:06:13,383 --> 01:06:15,383
"Dear Mr. Dufresne:

852
01:06:16,052 --> 01:06:18,121
In response to your inquiries...

853
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:23,126
...the state has allocated the enclosed
funds for your library project. "

854
01:06:23,226 --> 01:06:25,226
This is $200.

855
01:06:25,270 --> 01:06:29,382
"In addition, the library district
has generously responded...

856
01:06:29,482 --> 01:06:32,135
...with a donation of used books
and sundries.

857
01:06:32,235 --> 01:06:36,473
We trust this will fill your needs.
We now consider the matter closed.

858
01:06:36,573 --> 01:06:38,517
Please stop sending us letters. "

859
01:06:38,617 --> 01:06:41,436
Clear all this out
before the warden gets back.

860
01:06:41,536 --> 01:06:43,536
Yes, sir.

861
01:06:46,958 --> 01:06:48,958
Good for you, Andy.

862
01:06:51,087 --> 01:06:53,087
Wow!

863
01:06:53,423 --> 01:06:55,423
It only took six years.

864
01:06:56,927 --> 01:06:59,788
From now on, I'll write two
letters a week instead of one.

865
01:06:59,888 --> 01:07:03,375
I believe you're crazy enough.
Get this stuff out...

866
01:07:03,475 --> 01:07:04,418
...like he said.

867
01:07:04,518 --> 01:07:06,002
I've got to pinch a loaf.

868
01:07:06,102 --> 01:07:07,671
When I come back...

869
01:07:07,771 --> 01:07:10,406
...this is all gone, all right?

870
01:07:58,321 --> 01:08:00,321
Do you hear that?

871
01:09:08,433 --> 01:09:10,433
Dufresne!

872
01:09:12,145 --> 01:09:14,145
Andy, let me out!

873
01:09:20,570 --> 01:09:25,684
I have no idea to this day what those
two Italian ladies were singing about.

874
01:09:25,784 --> 01:09:28,145
Truth is, I don't want to know.

875
01:09:28,245 --> 01:09:31,050
Some things are best left unsaid.

876
01:09:34,292 --> 01:09:37,154
I like to think it was something
so beautiful...

877
01:09:37,254 --> 01:09:39,489
...it can't be expressed in words...

878
01:09:39,589 --> 01:09:43,244
...and makes your heart ache because of it.

879
01:09:44,135 --> 01:09:46,830
I tell you, those voices soared...

880
01:09:46,930 --> 01:09:51,334
...higher and farther than anybody
in a gray place dares to dream.

881
01:09:51,434 --> 01:09:54,880
It was like a beautiful bird
flapped into our drab cage...

882
01:09:54,980 --> 01:09:58,091
...and made those walls dissolve away.

883
01:09:58,191 --> 01:10:00,510
And for the briefest of moments...

884
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:04,095
...every last man at Shawshank felt free.

885
01:10:06,157 --> 01:10:09,642
It pissed the warden off something awful.

886
01:10:10,120 --> 01:10:12,120
Open the door.

887
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:16,040
Open it up!

888
01:10:17,127 --> 01:10:19,838
Dufresne, open this door!

889
01:10:21,173 --> 01:10:23,173
Turn that off!

890
01:10:29,472 --> 01:10:32,192
I am warning you. Turn that off!

891
01:10:49,659 --> 01:10:51,659
You're mine now.

892
01:10:58,627 --> 01:11:01,947
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

893
01:11:02,047 --> 01:11:04,047
On your feet.

894
01:11:04,841 --> 01:11:07,476
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

895
01:11:09,012 --> 01:11:12,916
You couldn't play something good, huh?
Like Hank Williams?

896
01:11:13,016 --> 01:11:15,919
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

897
01:11:16,019 --> 01:11:19,256
- Was it worth two weeks?
- Easiest time I ever did.

898
01:11:19,356 --> 01:11:23,635
- No such thing as easy time in the hole.
- A week in the hole is like a year.

899
01:11:23,735 --> 01:11:27,139
- Damn straight.
- I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

900
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:31,914
So they let you tote
that record player down there, huh?

901
01:11:32,661 --> 01:11:34,661
It was in here.

902
01:11:34,871 --> 01:11:36,871
In here.

903
01:11:37,207 --> 01:11:39,443
That's the beauty of music. They...

904
01:11:39,543 --> 01:11:41,878
...can't get that from you.

905
01:11:45,382 --> 01:11:49,037
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

906
01:11:49,553 --> 01:11:53,633
Well, I played a mean harmonica
as a younger man.

907
01:11:53,723 --> 01:11:55,542
Lost interest in it, though.

908
01:11:55,642 --> 01:11:57,461
Didn't make much sense in here.

909
01:11:57,561 --> 01:12:00,005
Here's where it makes the most sense.

910
01:12:00,105 --> 01:12:02,632
You need it so you don't forget.

911
01:12:02,732 --> 01:12:04,217
Forget?

912
01:12:04,317 --> 01:12:07,404
Forget that there are...

913
01:12:07,612 --> 01:12:09,473
...places...

914
01:12:09,573 --> 01:12:13,483
...in the world that aren't made out of stone.

915
01:12:14,411 --> 01:12:16,146
There's something...

916
01:12:16,246 --> 01:12:17,814
...inside...

917
01:12:17,914 --> 01:12:19,983
...that they can't get to...

918
01:12:20,083 --> 01:12:21,860
...that they can't touch.

919
01:12:21,960 --> 01:12:23,960
That's yours.

920
01:12:24,921 --> 01:12:27,216
What are you talking about?

921
01:12:27,591 --> 01:12:29,591
Hope.

922
01:12:29,885 --> 01:12:31,885
Hope.

923
01:12:33,138 --> 01:12:35,832
Let me tell you something, my friend.

924
01:12:35,932 --> 01:12:38,268
Hope is a dangerous thing.

925
01:12:39,436 --> 01:12:41,816
Hope can drive a man insane.

926
01:12:42,480 --> 01:12:44,716
It's got no use on the inside.

927
01:12:44,816 --> 01:12:47,791
You'd better get used to that idea.

928
01:12:49,529 --> 01:12:51,529
Like Brooks did?

929
01:13:16,389 --> 01:13:18,389
Sit down.

930
01:13:22,729 --> 01:13:27,092
Says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

931
01:13:27,192 --> 01:13:29,386
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

932
01:13:29,486 --> 01:13:31,486
Oh, yes, sir.

933
01:13:31,988 --> 01:13:33,988
Without a doubt.

934
01:13:34,491 --> 01:13:37,636
I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

935
01:13:38,870 --> 01:13:41,080
No danger to society here.

936
01:13:41,331 --> 01:13:43,331
God's honest truth.

937
01:13:45,460 --> 01:13:47,585
Absolutely rehabilitated.

938
01:13:57,556 --> 01:13:59,556
Thirty years.

939
01:14:00,851 --> 01:14:03,503
Jesus, when you say it like that...

940
01:14:03,603 --> 01:14:05,728
You wonder where it went.

941
01:14:07,858 --> 01:14:10,408
I wonder where 10 years went.

942
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:16,349
Here.

943
01:14:16,449 --> 01:14:19,339
A little parole rejection present.

944
01:14:20,453 --> 01:14:22,453
Go ahead and open it.

945
01:14:23,290 --> 01:14:25,400
Went through one of your competitors.

946
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:29,835
I hope you don't mind.
I wanted it to be a surprise.

947
01:14:38,680 --> 01:14:40,680
It's very pretty.

948
01:14:41,892 --> 01:14:43,892
Thank you.

949
01:14:45,645 --> 01:14:47,645
You going to play it?

950
01:14:51,693 --> 01:14:53,693
No.

951
01:14:56,573 --> 01:14:58,573
Not right now.

952
01:15:15,675 --> 01:15:17,675
Roll in!

953
01:15:52,963 --> 01:15:54,963
Lights out!

954
01:16:28,790 --> 01:16:31,255
Andy was as good as his word.

955
01:16:31,293 --> 01:16:34,948
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

956
01:16:36,131 --> 01:16:40,368
In 1959, the state senate
finally clued in to the fact...

957
01:16:40,468 --> 01:16:43,705
...they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

958
01:16:43,805 --> 01:16:48,210
Appropriations Committee
voted an annual payment of $500...

959
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:50,310
...just to shut him up.

960
01:16:50,437 --> 01:16:53,507
And you'd be amazed how far
Andy could stretch it.

961
01:16:53,607 --> 01:16:56,676
He made deals with book clubs,
charity groups.

962
01:16:56,776 --> 01:16:59,930
He bought remaindered books
by the pound...

963
01:17:00,030 --> 01:17:02,030
Treasure Island.

964
01:17:02,115 --> 01:17:03,517
Robert Louis-

965
01:17:03,617 --> 01:17:04,768
Stevenson.

966
01:17:04,868 --> 01:17:06,868
Fiction, adventure.

967
01:17:08,788 --> 01:17:09,940
What's next?

968
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:13,084
I got here Auto Repair...

969
01:17:13,835 --> 01:17:15,112
...and Soap Carving.

970
01:17:15,212 --> 01:17:18,532
Trade skills and hobbies.
Under "Educational," behind you.

971
01:17:18,632 --> 01:17:20,632
Count of Monte Crisco.

972
01:17:20,967 --> 01:17:23,517
That's "Crest," you dumb shit.

973
01:17:24,387 --> 01:17:25,747
By Alexandree...

974
01:17:25,847 --> 01:17:27,374
...Dum-ass.

975
01:17:27,474 --> 01:17:29,474
Dumb ass.

976
01:17:30,810 --> 01:17:32,810
Dumb ass?

977
01:17:34,773 --> 01:17:37,323
Dumas. Know what that's about?

978
01:17:38,985 --> 01:17:41,054
You'd like it.
It's about a prison break.

979
01:17:41,154 --> 01:17:45,851
We ought to file that
under "Educational" too, oughtn't we?

980
01:17:45,951 --> 01:17:50,522
The rest of us did our best
to pitch in when and where we could.

981
01:17:50,622 --> 01:17:52,524
By the year Kennedy was shot...

982
01:17:52,624 --> 01:17:57,320
...Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of turpentine...

983
01:17:57,420 --> 01:18:01,116
...into the best prison library
in New England...

984
01:18:01,216 --> 01:18:05,466
...complete with a fine selection
of Hank Williams.

985
01:18:11,518 --> 01:18:13,587
That was also when Warden Norton...

986
01:18:13,687 --> 01:18:16,965
...instituted his famous
"Inside Out" program.

987
01:18:17,065 --> 01:18:19,259
You may remember reading about it.

988
01:18:19,359 --> 01:18:22,596
It made the papers
and got his picture in Look magazine.

989
01:18:22,696 --> 01:18:24,097
It's no free ride...

990
01:18:24,197 --> 01:18:27,517
.. but rather a genuine
progressive advance...

991
01:18:27,617 --> 01:18:30,353
...in corrections and rehabilitation.

992
01:18:30,453 --> 01:18:33,106
Our inmates, properly supervised...

993
01:18:33,206 --> 01:18:35,942
...will be put to work outside these walls...

994
01:18:36,042 --> 01:18:39,697
...performing all manner of public service.

995
01:18:39,880 --> 01:18:42,199
These men can learn the value...

996
01:18:42,299 --> 01:18:46,203
...of an honest day's labor and
provide a service to the community...

997
01:18:46,303 --> 01:18:51,333
...at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q. Taxpayer.

998
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:53,877
Of course he didn't tell the press...

999
01:18:53,977 --> 01:18:57,547
...that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

1000
01:18:57,647 --> 01:19:00,801
There are 100 different ways
to skim off the top.

1001
01:19:00,901 --> 01:19:03,361
Men, materials, you name it.

1002
01:19:03,737 --> 01:19:06,723
And oh, my Lord,
how the money rolled in!

1003
01:19:06,823 --> 01:19:09,476
At this rate,
you'll put me out of business.

1004
01:19:09,576 --> 01:19:14,481
With this pool of slave labor,
you can underbid any contractor in town.

1005
01:19:14,581 --> 01:19:17,651
We're providing
a valuable community service.

1006
01:19:17,751 --> 01:19:22,596
That's fine for the papers,
but I've got a family to feed.

1007
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:26,090
We go back a long way.

1008
01:19:26,927 --> 01:19:32,666
I need this highway contract. I don't
get it and I go under. That's a fact.

1009
01:19:32,766 --> 01:19:34,668
You have some of this fine pie...

1010
01:19:34,768 --> 01:19:38,763
...my missus made for you.
You think about that.

1011
01:19:46,404 --> 01:19:49,224
I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

1012
01:19:49,324 --> 01:19:52,809
I already got my boys
committed elsewhere.

1013
01:19:54,371 --> 01:19:58,281
You be sure and thank Maisie
for this fine pie.

1014
01:19:58,542 --> 01:20:00,944
And behind every shady deal...

1015
01:20:01,044 --> 01:20:03,764
...behind every dollar earned...

1016
01:20:03,964 --> 01:20:07,109
...there was Andy, keeping the books.

1017
01:20:07,425 --> 01:20:08,827
Two deposits.

1018
01:20:08,927 --> 01:20:14,367
Maine National and New England First.
Night drops as always, sir.

1019
01:20:43,253 --> 01:20:47,949
Get my stuff to the laundry. Two suits
for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.

1020
01:20:48,049 --> 01:20:51,703
If they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear from me.

1021
01:20:51,803 --> 01:20:53,803
How do I look?

1022
01:20:54,181 --> 01:20:56,750
- Very nice.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

1023
01:20:56,850 --> 01:20:58,850
Governor will be there.

1024
01:20:59,811 --> 01:21:02,021
You want the rest of this?

1025
01:21:02,606 --> 01:21:04,986
Woman can't bake worth shit.

1026
01:21:05,775 --> 01:21:07,775
Thank you, sir.

1027
01:21:09,946 --> 01:21:13,266
He's got his fingers
in a lot of pies, from what I hear.

1028
01:21:13,366 --> 01:21:18,313
He's got scams you haven't even
dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

1029
01:21:18,413 --> 01:21:20,899
A river of dirty money
running through here.

1030
01:21:20,999 --> 01:21:24,945
Sooner or later, he'll have to
explain where it came from.

1031
01:21:25,045 --> 01:21:27,045
That's where I come in.

1032
01:21:27,380 --> 01:21:29,783
I channel it. Filter it. Funnel it.

1033
01:21:29,883 --> 01:21:32,953
Stocks, securities,
tax-free municipals.

1034
01:21:33,053 --> 01:21:36,706
I send it out into the real world,
and when it comes back...

1035
01:21:36,806 --> 01:21:40,293
- Clean as a virgin's honeypot, huh?
- Cleaner.

1036
01:21:40,393 --> 01:21:45,493
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

1037
01:21:46,316 --> 01:21:50,804
If they ever catch on, he'll wind up
in here wearing a number himself.

1038
01:21:50,904 --> 01:21:53,723
I thought you had
more faith in me than that.

1039
01:21:53,823 --> 01:21:56,977
I know you're good,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

1040
01:21:57,077 --> 01:22:00,455
Now anybody gets curious,
FBI, IRS...

1041
01:22:00,664 --> 01:22:01,982
...whatever.

1042
01:22:02,082 --> 01:22:03,483
It'll lead to somebody.

1043
01:22:03,583 --> 01:22:08,513
Sure it is, but not to me,
and certainly not to the warden.

1044
01:22:11,842 --> 01:22:12,951
All right, who?

1045
01:22:13,051 --> 01:22:15,051
Randall Stevens.

1046
01:22:15,178 --> 01:22:16,204
Who?

1047
01:22:16,304 --> 01:22:18,415
The "silent" silent partner.

1048
01:22:18,515 --> 01:22:21,668
He's the guilty one,
the man with the bank accounts.

1049
01:22:21,768 --> 01:22:24,045
It's where the filtering process starts.

1050
01:22:24,145 --> 01:22:27,507
They trace anything,
it'll just lead to him.

1051
01:22:27,607 --> 01:22:28,967
But who is he?

1052
01:22:29,067 --> 01:22:34,014
He's a phantom, an apparition.
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

1053
01:22:34,114 --> 01:22:35,390
I conjured him...

1054
01:22:35,490 --> 01:22:37,490
...out of thin air.

1055
01:22:37,659 --> 01:22:40,549
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

1056
01:22:43,456 --> 01:22:45,942
You can't just make a person up.

1057
01:22:46,042 --> 01:22:49,529
Sure you can,
if you know how the system works.

1058
01:22:49,629 --> 01:22:52,699
It's amazing what you
can accomplish by mail.

1059
01:22:52,799 --> 01:22:55,535
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate...

1060
01:22:55,635 --> 01:22:57,954
...driver's license, Social Security.

1061
01:22:58,054 --> 01:22:59,164
You're shitting me.

1062
01:22:59,264 --> 01:23:02,709
If they trace any accounts,
they'll wind up chasing...

1063
01:23:02,809 --> 01:23:04,669
...a figment of my imagination.

1064
01:23:04,769 --> 01:23:06,771
Well, I'll be damned!

1065
01:23:08,106 --> 01:23:10,146
Did I say you were good?

1066
01:23:10,192 --> 01:23:12,232
Shit, you are Rembrandt.

1067
01:23:12,569 --> 01:23:14,387
The funny thing is...

1068
01:23:14,487 --> 01:23:18,892
...on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

1069
01:23:18,992 --> 01:23:22,222
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

1070
01:23:30,212 --> 01:23:32,212
Ever bother you?

1071
01:23:32,964 --> 01:23:36,201
I don't run the scams.
I just process the profits.

1072
01:23:36,301 --> 01:23:38,303
A fine line, maybe...

1073
01:23:38,845 --> 01:23:41,039
...but I also built that library...

1074
01:23:41,139 --> 01:23:44,251
...and used it to help guys
get their high school diploma.

1075
01:23:44,351 --> 01:23:46,711
Why do you think he lets me do all that?

1076
01:23:46,811 --> 01:23:49,089
Keep you happy and doing the laundry.

1077
01:23:49,189 --> 01:23:50,924
Money instead of sheets.

1078
01:23:51,024 --> 01:23:54,339
Well, I work cheap.
That's the tradeoff.

1079
01:24:10,877 --> 01:24:13,655
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965...

1080
01:24:13,755 --> 01:24:16,116
...on a two-year stretch for B and E.

1081
01:24:16,216 --> 01:24:18,744
That's breaking and entering to you.

1082
01:24:18,844 --> 01:24:23,415
Cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

1083
01:24:23,515 --> 01:24:24,916
Young punk.

1084
01:24:25,016 --> 01:24:26,752
Mr. Rock 'n' Roll...

1085
01:24:26,852 --> 01:24:28,462
...cocky as hell.

1086
01:24:28,562 --> 01:24:31,131
Come on, old boys.
Moving like molasses!

1087
01:24:31,231 --> 01:24:33,091
Making me look bad.

1088
01:24:33,191 --> 01:24:35,135
We liked him immediately.

1089
01:24:35,235 --> 01:24:39,139
I'm backing out the door
and I got the TV like this.

1090
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:43,435
A big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Then I hear this voice.

1091
01:24:43,535 --> 01:24:45,604
"Freeze, kid, hands in the air. "

1092
01:24:45,704 --> 01:24:50,275
I was standing there, holding onto
that TV. Finally the voice says:

1093
01:24:50,375 --> 01:24:54,279
"You hear what I said, boy?"
I say, "Yes, sir. I did.

1094
01:24:54,379 --> 01:24:59,649
But if I drop this, you get me
on destruction of property too. "

1095
01:25:02,304 --> 01:25:04,998
You done some stretch in Cashman, right?

1096
01:25:05,098 --> 01:25:09,252
Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

1097
01:25:09,352 --> 01:25:11,379
Weekend furloughs.
Work programs.

1098
01:25:11,479 --> 01:25:12,672
Not like here.

1099
01:25:12,772 --> 01:25:15,509
Sounds like you done time all over.

1100
01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:18,136
I've been in and out since I was 13.

1101
01:25:18,236 --> 01:25:20,514
Name it, chances are I've been there.

1102
01:25:20,614 --> 01:25:24,014
Perhaps you should try a new profession.

1103
01:25:24,743 --> 01:25:26,520
What I mean is...

1104
01:25:26,620 --> 01:25:30,190
...you're not a very good thief.
You should try something else.

1105
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:33,860
Yeah, what the hell
you know about it, Capone?

1106
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:35,695
What are you in for?

1107
01:25:35,795 --> 01:25:37,795
Me?

1108
01:25:39,257 --> 01:25:41,257
A lawyer fucked me.

1109
01:25:44,804 --> 01:25:48,969
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

1110
01:25:55,690 --> 01:26:00,554
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

1111
01:26:00,654 --> 01:26:02,889
Maybe he thought of them on the streets...

1112
01:26:02,989 --> 01:26:05,725
...or his child growing up
not knowing her daddy.

1113
01:26:05,825 --> 01:26:07,394
Whatever it was...

1114
01:26:07,494 --> 01:26:11,319
...something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

1115
01:26:13,792 --> 01:26:16,737
Thought I might try for
my high school equivalency.

1116
01:26:16,837 --> 01:26:20,662
Hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

1117
01:26:20,715 --> 01:26:23,945
I don't waste time with losers, Tommy.

1118
01:26:24,344 --> 01:26:26,847
I ain't no goddamn loser.

1119
01:26:28,598 --> 01:26:30,598
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

1120
01:26:32,102 --> 01:26:34,102
You really mean that?

1121
01:26:34,563 --> 01:26:36,047
Yes, sir, I do.

1122
01:26:36,147 --> 01:26:38,216
Good. Because if we do this...

1123
01:26:38,316 --> 01:26:42,429
...we do it all the way,
a hundred percent, nothing half-assed.

1124
01:26:42,529 --> 01:26:44,529
Thing is, see...

1125
01:26:45,574 --> 01:26:47,614
...I don't read so good.

1126
01:26:48,285 --> 01:26:50,285
"Well. "

1127
01:26:51,371 --> 01:26:53,371
You don't read...

1128
01:26:53,373 --> 01:26:55,373
...so well.

1129
01:26:57,210 --> 01:26:59,210
We'll get to that.

1130
01:27:03,175 --> 01:27:05,410
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

1131
01:27:05,510 --> 01:27:08,740
Started walking him through his ABC's.

1132
01:27:10,265 --> 01:27:12,626
Tommy took to it pretty well too.

1133
01:27:12,726 --> 01:27:15,956
Boy found brains he never knew he had.

1134
01:27:17,856 --> 01:27:21,384
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

1135
01:27:21,484 --> 01:27:23,261
He really liked the kid.

1136
01:27:23,361 --> 01:27:27,307
Gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

1137
01:27:27,407 --> 01:27:30,127
But that wasn't the only reason.

1138
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:32,579
Prison time is slow time.

1139
01:27:33,079 --> 01:27:35,899
So you do what you can to keep going.

1140
01:27:35,999 --> 01:27:38,294
Some fellas collect stamps.

1141
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:41,095
Others build matchstick houses.

1142
01:27:41,546 --> 01:27:44,216
Andy built a library.

1143
01:27:44,716 --> 01:27:47,096
Now he needed a new project.

1144
01:27:47,511 --> 01:27:49,511
Tommy was it.

1145
01:27:49,638 --> 01:27:54,084
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

1146
01:27:54,184 --> 01:27:58,213
The same reason he hung
his fantasy girlies on the wall.

1147
01:27:58,313 --> 01:27:59,756
In prison...

1148
01:27:59,856 --> 01:28:04,261
...a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1149
01:28:04,361 --> 01:28:09,349
By 1966, right about the time Tommy
was getting ready to take his exams...

1150
01:28:09,449 --> 01:28:11,660
...it was lovely Raquel.

1151
01:28:28,218 --> 01:28:30,218
Time.

1152
01:28:35,267 --> 01:28:37,267
Well?

1153
01:28:37,853 --> 01:28:39,980
Well, it's for shit.

1154
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:43,425
I wasted a whole year
of my time with this bullshit.

1155
01:28:43,525 --> 01:28:45,135
It's probably not that bad.

1156
01:28:45,235 --> 01:28:49,556
I didn't get a thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

1157
01:28:49,656 --> 01:28:51,516
Let's see how the score comes out.

1158
01:28:51,616 --> 01:28:55,441
I'll tell you
how the goddamn score comes out.

1159
01:28:56,496 --> 01:28:57,981
Two points, right there!

1160
01:28:58,081 --> 01:28:59,775
There's your goddamn score!

1161
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:04,125
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5 times 5 is 25...

1162
01:29:04,504 --> 01:29:06,281
Fuck this place!

1163
01:29:06,381 --> 01:29:08,381
Fuck it!

1164
01:29:26,693 --> 01:29:28,053
I feel bad.

1165
01:29:28,153 --> 01:29:29,429
I let him down.

1166
01:29:29,529 --> 01:29:31,389
That's crap, kid.

1167
01:29:31,489 --> 01:29:33,058
He's proud of you.

1168
01:29:33,158 --> 01:29:36,103
We're old friends,
I know him as good as anybody.

1169
01:29:36,203 --> 01:29:37,896
Smart fellow, ain't he?

1170
01:29:37,996 --> 01:29:41,233
Smart as they come.
He was a banker on the outside.

1171
01:29:41,333 --> 01:29:43,798
What's he in here for anyway?

1172
01:29:43,877 --> 01:29:45,877
Murder.

1173
01:29:46,338 --> 01:29:48,338
The hell, you say.

1174
01:29:49,841 --> 01:29:53,326
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

1175
01:29:53,386 --> 01:29:58,486
Caught his wife in bed
with some golf pro. Greased them both.

1176
01:30:05,524 --> 01:30:07,524
What?

1177
01:30:07,859 --> 01:30:10,403
About four years ago...

1178
01:30:10,695 --> 01:30:14,307
...I was in Thomaston
on a two-to-three stretch.

1179
01:30:14,407 --> 01:30:15,976
I stole a car.

1180
01:30:16,076 --> 01:30:18,711
It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

1181
01:30:18,745 --> 01:30:21,189
About six months left to go...

1182
01:30:21,289 --> 01:30:23,584
...I get a new cellmate in.

1183
01:30:23,917 --> 01:30:25,917
Elmo Blatch.

1184
01:30:26,253 --> 01:30:28,253
Big, twitchy fucker.

1185
01:30:28,421 --> 01:30:32,033
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.
You know what I'm saying?

1186
01:30:32,133 --> 01:30:34,886
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

1187
01:30:35,136 --> 01:30:37,497
Said he pulled hundreds of jobs.

1188
01:30:37,597 --> 01:30:43,503
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.
You cut a loud fart, he jumped three feet.

1189
01:30:43,603 --> 01:30:48,341
Talked all the time too. That's
the other thing. He never shut up.

1190
01:30:48,441 --> 01:30:50,302
Places he'd been in...

1191
01:30:50,402 --> 01:30:53,547
...jobs he'd pulled, women he fucked.

1192
01:30:53,697 --> 01:30:55,907
Even people he killed.

1193
01:30:57,117 --> 01:30:59,911
People who "gave him shit. "

1194
01:31:00,579 --> 01:31:02,579
That's how he put it.

1195
01:31:04,749 --> 01:31:07,129
So one night, like a joke...

1196
01:31:07,919 --> 01:31:11,404
...I say to him,
"Elmo, who did you kill?"

1197
01:31:11,631 --> 01:31:12,866
So he says:

1198
01:31:12,966 --> 01:31:17,496
I got me this job one time,
busing tables at a country club...

1199
01:31:17,596 --> 01:31:22,441
...so I could case all these big
rich pricks that come in.

1200
01:31:23,602 --> 01:31:25,727
So I pick out this guy...

1201
01:31:26,479 --> 01:31:28,173
...go in one night...

1202
01:31:28,273 --> 01:31:30,273
...and do his place.

1203
01:31:31,443 --> 01:31:33,443
He wakes up...

1204
01:31:33,486 --> 01:31:35,486
...and gives me shit.

1205
01:31:36,323 --> 01:31:38,323
So I killed him.

1206
01:31:39,784 --> 01:31:42,929
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

1207
01:31:43,997 --> 01:31:46,291
And that's the best part.

1208
01:31:46,958 --> 01:31:49,528
She's fucking this prick, see...

1209
01:31:49,628 --> 01:31:53,198
...this golf pro,
but she's married to some other guy.

1210
01:31:53,298 --> 01:31:55,842
Some hotshot banker.

1211
01:31:57,302 --> 01:32:00,277
And he's the one they pinned it on.

1212
01:32:11,274 --> 01:32:16,034
I have to say that's
the most amazing story I ever heard.

1213
01:32:16,404 --> 01:32:19,558
What amazes me most
is you'd be taken in by it.

1214
01:32:19,658 --> 01:32:21,658
Sir?

1215
01:32:22,869 --> 01:32:26,940
It's obvious this fellow Williams
is impressed with you.

1216
01:32:27,040 --> 01:32:31,111
He hears your tale of woe
and naturally wants to cheer you up.

1217
01:32:31,211 --> 01:32:33,780
He's young, not terribly bright.

1218
01:32:33,880 --> 01:32:37,617
It's not surprising he wouldn't
know what a state he put you in.

1219
01:32:37,717 --> 01:32:39,953
Sir, he's telling the truth.

1220
01:32:40,053 --> 01:32:44,224
Let's say for the moment
this Blatch does exist.

1221
01:32:44,516 --> 01:32:49,254
You think he'd just fall to his knees
and cry, "Yes, I did it. I confess.

1222
01:32:49,354 --> 01:32:52,132
By the way,
add a life term to my sentence. "

1223
01:32:52,232 --> 01:32:55,135
With Tommy's testimony,
I can get a new trial.

1224
01:32:55,235 --> 01:32:57,846
That's assuming Blatch is still there.

1225
01:32:57,946 --> 01:32:59,973
Chances are, he'd be released by now.

1226
01:33:00,073 --> 01:33:02,642
They'd have his last known address.

1227
01:33:02,742 --> 01:33:04,782
It's a chance, isn't it?

1228
01:33:07,038 --> 01:33:09,163
How can you be so obtuse?

1229
01:33:09,708 --> 01:33:11,708
What?

1230
01:33:12,210 --> 01:33:13,779
What did you call me?

1231
01:33:13,879 --> 01:33:15,864
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

1232
01:33:15,964 --> 01:33:17,699
You're forgetting yourself.

1233
01:33:17,799 --> 01:33:20,827
The country club
will have his old timecards.

1234
01:33:20,927 --> 01:33:23,830
Records, W-2s with his name on them.

1235
01:33:23,930 --> 01:33:26,708
If you want to indulge this fantasy,
it's your business.

1236
01:33:26,808 --> 01:33:29,503
Don't make it mine.
This meeting is over.

1237
01:33:29,603 --> 01:33:32,756
If I got out, I'd never mention
what happens here.

1238
01:33:32,856 --> 01:33:37,361
I'd be as indictable as you
for laundering that money.

1239
01:33:37,694 --> 01:33:40,722
Don't ever mention money to me,
you son of a bitch!

1240
01:33:40,822 --> 01:33:42,599
Not in this office...

1241
01:33:42,699 --> 01:33:44,768
...not anywhere.
Get in here, now!

1242
01:33:44,868 --> 01:33:48,105
I just wanted to put you at ease,
that's all.

1243
01:33:48,205 --> 01:33:50,205
Solitary. A month.

1244
01:33:50,457 --> 01:33:51,858
What's wrong with you?

1245
01:33:51,958 --> 01:33:53,360
Get him out of here.

1246
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:55,153
This is my chance to get out!

1247
01:33:55,253 --> 01:33:57,155
It's my life! Understand?!

1248
01:33:57,255 --> 01:33:59,299
Get him out!

1249
01:34:01,092 --> 01:34:03,092
A month in the hole.

1250
01:34:03,261 --> 01:34:06,039
That's the longest stretch I ever heard of.

1251
01:34:06,139 --> 01:34:07,541
It's all my fault.

1252
01:34:07,641 --> 01:34:09,641
Bullshit.

1253
01:34:09,935 --> 01:34:12,712
You didn't pull the trigger or convict him.

1254
01:34:12,812 --> 01:34:15,340
Are you saying Andy is innocent?

1255
01:34:15,440 --> 01:34:17,650
I mean, for real innocent?

1256
01:34:17,651 --> 01:34:19,344
It looks that way.

1257
01:34:19,444 --> 01:34:21,444
Sweet Jesus.

1258
01:34:21,613 --> 01:34:23,723
How long has he been here now?

1259
01:34:23,823 --> 01:34:27,118
1947. What is that?
Nineteen years.

1260
01:34:27,327 --> 01:34:30,302
- Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

1261
01:34:35,794 --> 01:34:37,487
What you got?

1262
01:34:37,587 --> 01:34:39,030
Board of Education.

1263
01:34:39,130 --> 01:34:40,741
That son of a bitch mailed it.

1264
01:34:40,841 --> 01:34:44,911
You going to open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

1265
01:34:45,011 --> 01:34:47,646
Thumb up my butt sounds better.

1266
01:34:47,681 --> 01:34:51,336
Skeets, come on.
Give me that, you shithead.

1267
01:34:51,351 --> 01:34:53,351
Floyd, come on.

1268
01:34:58,149 --> 01:35:00,954
Will you throw that away, please?

1269
01:35:06,157 --> 01:35:08,157
Well, shit.

1270
01:35:20,547 --> 01:35:23,341
The kid passed. C + average.

1271
01:35:23,550 --> 01:35:25,845
Thought you'd like to know.

1272
01:35:41,902 --> 01:35:43,902
Warden wants to talk.

1273
01:35:57,083 --> 01:35:58,276
Out here?

1274
01:35:58,376 --> 01:36:00,587
That's what the man said.

1275
01:36:16,728 --> 01:36:18,728
Warden?

1276
01:36:27,739 --> 01:36:32,499
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

1277
01:36:33,286 --> 01:36:35,921
I feel awkward enough as it is.

1278
01:36:54,015 --> 01:36:56,101
We got a situation here.

1279
01:36:56,977 --> 01:36:59,171
I think you can appreciate that.

1280
01:36:59,271 --> 01:37:00,672
Yes, sir.

1281
01:37:00,772 --> 01:37:02,340
I sure can.

1282
01:37:02,440 --> 01:37:07,846
I tell you, son, this thing really
came along and knocked my wind out.

1283
01:37:07,946 --> 01:37:11,261
It's got me up nights.
That's the truth.

1284
01:37:12,784 --> 01:37:14,824
The right thing to do...

1285
01:37:16,288 --> 01:37:20,028
...sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

1286
01:37:21,001 --> 01:37:23,001
Do you understand?

1287
01:37:24,754 --> 01:37:26,754
I need your help, son.

1288
01:37:27,799 --> 01:37:30,202
If I'm going to move on this...

1289
01:37:30,302 --> 01:37:34,081
...there can't be
the least little shred of doubt.

1290
01:37:34,181 --> 01:37:35,373
I have to know...

1291
01:37:35,473 --> 01:37:38,210
...if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

1292
01:37:38,310 --> 01:37:39,544
Yes, sir.

1293
01:37:39,644 --> 01:37:41,254
Absolutely.

1294
01:37:41,354 --> 01:37:44,466
Would you be willing to swear
before a judge and jury...

1295
01:37:44,566 --> 01:37:46,676
...with your hand on the Good Book...

1296
01:37:46,776 --> 01:37:49,554
...and take an oath
before Almighty God himself?

1297
01:37:49,654 --> 01:37:51,779
Just give me that chance.

1298
01:37:55,702 --> 01:37:57,702
That's what I thought.

1299
01:38:44,125 --> 01:38:46,590
I'm sure by now you've heard.

1300
01:38:47,796 --> 01:38:49,796
Terrible thing.

1301
01:38:50,423 --> 01:38:52,159
A man that young...

1302
01:38:52,259 --> 01:38:55,287
...less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

1303
01:38:55,387 --> 01:38:58,498
Broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

1304
01:38:58,598 --> 01:39:00,598
Truly, it did.

1305
01:39:03,103 --> 01:39:05,908
We just have to put it behind us.

1306
01:39:07,232 --> 01:39:09,232
Move on.

1307
01:39:10,068 --> 01:39:12,068
I'm done.

1308
01:39:12,863 --> 01:39:14,863
Everything stops.

1309
01:39:16,449 --> 01:39:19,424
Get someone else to run your scams.

1310
01:39:20,078 --> 01:39:22,078
Nothing stops.

1311
01:39:23,248 --> 01:39:25,248
Nothing.

1312
01:39:27,794 --> 01:39:31,279
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

1313
01:39:31,298 --> 01:39:33,742
No more protection from the guards.

1314
01:39:33,842 --> 01:39:40,040
I'll pull you out of that 1-bunk Hilton
and cast you down with the sodomites.

1315
01:39:40,140 --> 01:39:43,795
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

1316
01:39:43,977 --> 01:39:45,977
And the library?

1317
01:39:46,146 --> 01:39:47,672
Gone.

1318
01:39:47,772 --> 01:39:50,317
Sealed off, brick by brick.

1319
01:39:50,817 --> 01:39:53,553
We'll have us a little
book barbecue in the yard.

1320
01:39:53,653 --> 01:39:55,889
They'll see the flames for miles.

1321
01:39:55,989 --> 01:39:59,304
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

1322
01:40:00,118 --> 01:40:03,263
You understand me? Catching my drift?

1323
01:40:06,833 --> 01:40:08,833
Or am I being obtuse?

1324
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:23,999
Give him another month to think about it.

1325
01:41:09,896 --> 01:41:13,466
My wife used to say
I'm a hard man to know.

1326
01:41:13,733 --> 01:41:15,733
Like a closed book.

1327
01:41:16,403 --> 01:41:19,208
Complained about it all the time.

1328
01:41:19,364 --> 01:41:21,364
She was beautiful.

1329
01:41:23,326 --> 01:41:25,326
God, I loved her.

1330
01:41:28,582 --> 01:41:32,067
I didn't know how to show it, that's all.

1331
01:41:33,545 --> 01:41:35,545
I killed her, Red.

1332
01:41:37,090 --> 01:41:39,470
I didn't pull the trigger...

1333
01:41:40,302 --> 01:41:42,342
...but I drove her away.

1334
01:41:43,555 --> 01:41:46,333
That's why she died, because of me...

1335
01:41:46,433 --> 01:41:48,433
...the way I am.

1336
01:41:56,818 --> 01:41:59,453
That don't make you a murderer.

1337
01:42:02,032 --> 01:42:04,032
Bad husband, maybe.

1338
01:42:07,454 --> 01:42:10,816
Feel bad about it if you want,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

1339
01:42:10,916 --> 01:42:12,526
No, I didn't.

1340
01:42:12,626 --> 01:42:14,626
Somebody else did.

1341
01:42:15,795 --> 01:42:17,923
And I wound up in here.

1342
01:42:20,383 --> 01:42:22,383
Bad luck, I guess.

1343
01:42:27,182 --> 01:42:29,182
It floats around.

1344
01:42:29,643 --> 01:42:32,108
It's got to land on somebody.

1345
01:42:32,812 --> 01:42:35,107
It was my turn, that's all.

1346
01:42:35,398 --> 01:42:38,203
I was in the path of the tornado.

1347
01:42:44,115 --> 01:42:49,130
I just didn't expect the storm
would last as long as it has.

1348
01:42:52,415 --> 01:42:55,305
Think you'll ever get out of here?

1349
01:42:55,335 --> 01:42:57,335
Me?

1350
01:42:59,339 --> 01:43:01,339
Yeah.

1351
01:43:01,675 --> 01:43:04,077
One day, when I got a long, white beard...

1352
01:43:04,177 --> 01:43:08,512
...and two or three marbles
rolling around upstairs.

1353
01:43:09,391 --> 01:43:11,431
I tell you where I'd go.

1354
01:43:12,519 --> 01:43:14,519
Zihuatanejo.

1355
01:43:15,021 --> 01:43:16,423
Say what?

1356
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:18,523
Zihuatanejo.

1357
01:43:19,317 --> 01:43:21,317
It's in Mexico.

1358
01:43:22,362 --> 01:43:25,422
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

1359
01:43:25,615 --> 01:43:29,695
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

1360
01:43:30,203 --> 01:43:32,413
They say it has no memory.

1361
01:43:34,207 --> 01:43:38,202
That's where I want to live
the rest of my life.

1362
01:43:38,503 --> 01:43:40,964
A warm place with no memory.

1363
01:43:44,217 --> 01:43:46,342
Open up a little hotel...

1364
01:43:47,888 --> 01:43:49,888
...right on the beach.

1365
01:43:49,973 --> 01:43:52,523
Buy some worthless old boat...

1366
01:43:52,726 --> 01:43:54,726
...and fix it up new.

1367
01:43:57,063 --> 01:43:59,063
Take my guests out...

1368
01:43:59,149 --> 01:44:01,149
...charter fishing.

1369
01:44:04,362 --> 01:44:06,362
Zihuatanejo.

1370
01:44:09,618 --> 01:44:15,398
In a place like that, I could use
a man that knows how to get things.

1371
01:44:20,045 --> 01:44:23,870
I don't think I could make it on the outside.

1372
01:44:29,554 --> 01:44:32,189
I been in here most of my life.

1373
01:44:33,058 --> 01:44:35,523
I'm an institutional man now.

1374
01:44:35,727 --> 01:44:37,727
Just like Brooks was.

1375
01:44:38,939 --> 01:44:41,091
You underestimate yourself.

1376
01:44:41,191 --> 01:44:43,191
I don't think so.

1377
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:51,226
In here I'm the guy who can get things
for you, sure, but...

1378
01:44:51,326 --> 01:44:53,979
...outside all you need is the Yellow Pages.

1379
01:44:54,079 --> 01:44:57,224
Hell, I wouldn't know where to begin.

1380
01:44:58,458 --> 01:45:00,458
Pacific Ocean?

1381
01:45:00,460 --> 01:45:01,987
Shit.

1382
01:45:02,087 --> 01:45:04,364
Scare me to death,
something that big.

1383
01:45:04,464 --> 01:45:06,464
Not me.

1384
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:11,387
I didn't shoot my wife,
and I didn't shoot her lover.

1385
01:45:11,471 --> 01:45:15,667
Whatever mistakes I made,
I've paid for them and then some.

1386
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:17,892
That hotel, that boat...

1387
01:45:19,020 --> 01:45:22,165
I don't think that's too much to ask.

1388
01:45:26,152 --> 01:45:28,722
You shouldn't be doing this to yourself.

1389
01:45:28,822 --> 01:45:31,183
This is just shitty pipe dreams.

1390
01:45:31,283 --> 01:45:33,852
Mexico is way down there
and you're in here...

1391
01:45:33,952 --> 01:45:35,729
...and that's the way it is.

1392
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:38,665
Yeah, right.
That's the way it is.

1393
01:45:40,166 --> 01:45:42,886
It's down there and I'm in here.

1394
01:45:45,172 --> 01:45:48,657
I guess it comes down to a simple choice.

1395
01:45:50,802 --> 01:45:52,802
Get busy living...

1396
01:45:53,680 --> 01:45:55,682
...or get busy dying.

1397
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:10,639
If you ever get out of here,
do me a favor.

1398
01:46:10,739 --> 01:46:12,991
Sure, Andy. Anything.

1399
01:46:14,868 --> 01:46:20,107
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

1400
01:46:20,207 --> 01:46:23,443
- A lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

1401
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:27,614
It's got a long rock wall
with a big oak tree at the north end.

1402
01:46:27,714 --> 01:46:31,410
It's like something
out of a Robert Frost poem.

1403
01:46:31,510 --> 01:46:34,825
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

1404
01:46:35,388 --> 01:46:37,853
We went there for a picnic...

1405
01:46:37,891 --> 01:46:40,585
...and made love under that oak...

1406
01:46:40,685 --> 01:46:43,405
...and I asked and she said yes.

1407
01:46:46,900 --> 01:46:48,900
Promise me, Red.

1408
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:51,304
If you ever get out...

1409
01:46:51,404 --> 01:46:53,404
...find that spot.

1410
01:46:54,074 --> 01:46:59,980
At the base of that wall, there's a rock
that has no earthly business in Maine.

1411
01:47:00,080 --> 01:47:03,083
Piece of black, volcanic glass.

1412
01:47:05,752 --> 01:47:09,114
Something's buried under it
I want you to have.

1413
01:47:09,214 --> 01:47:10,782
What, Andy?

1414
01:47:10,882 --> 01:47:13,092
What's buried under there?

1415
01:47:14,219 --> 01:47:16,163
You'll have to pry it up...

1416
01:47:16,263 --> 01:47:18,263
...to see.

1417
01:47:23,436 --> 01:47:25,964
No, I'm telling you. The guy is...

1418
01:47:26,064 --> 01:47:28,064
He's talking funny.

1419
01:47:28,900 --> 01:47:30,886
I'm really worried about him.

1420
01:47:30,986 --> 01:47:32,512
Let's keep an eye on him.

1421
01:47:32,612 --> 01:47:37,287
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's all alone.

1422
01:47:37,325 --> 01:47:39,325
Oh, Lord.

1423
01:47:39,786 --> 01:47:41,786
What?

1424
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:45,025
Andy come down
to the loading dock today.

1425
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:47,319
He asked me for a length of rope.

1426
01:47:47,419 --> 01:47:48,361
Rope?

1427
01:47:48,461 --> 01:47:50,238
Six feet long.

1428
01:47:50,338 --> 01:47:52,338
And you gave it to him.

1429
01:47:52,591 --> 01:47:54,591
Sure. Why wouldn't I?

1430
01:47:54,593 --> 01:47:56,593
Jesus! Heywood.

1431
01:47:56,761 --> 01:47:58,830
How was I supposed to know?

1432
01:47:58,930 --> 01:48:00,930
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

1433
01:48:02,475 --> 01:48:04,600
Andy would never do that.

1434
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:07,020
Never.

1435
01:48:08,148 --> 01:48:10,148
I don't know.

1436
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:15,124
Every man has his breaking point.

1437
01:48:16,698 --> 01:48:19,184
Lickety-split.
Want to get home.

1438
01:48:19,284 --> 01:48:21,409
Just about finished, sir.

1439
01:48:38,178 --> 01:48:40,178
Three deposits tonight.

1440
01:48:47,771 --> 01:48:49,756
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

1441
01:48:49,856 --> 01:48:51,591
And shine my shoes.

1442
01:48:51,691 --> 01:48:55,431
- I want them looking like mirrors.
- Yes, sir.

1443
01:49:00,158 --> 01:49:02,368
It's good having you back.

1444
01:49:02,536 --> 01:49:05,426
Place wasn't the same without you.

1445
01:49:51,293 --> 01:49:53,293
Lights out!

1446
01:50:25,202 --> 01:50:28,092
I've had some long nights in stir.

1447
01:50:28,288 --> 01:50:31,024
Alone in the dark
with nothing but your thoughts...

1448
01:50:31,124 --> 01:50:34,014
...time can draw out like a blade.

1449
01:50:39,132 --> 01:50:42,362
That was the longest night of my life.

1450
01:50:57,984 --> 01:50:59,984
Give me a count!

1451
01:51:03,657 --> 01:51:06,493
Tier 3 south, clear!

1452
01:51:09,663 --> 01:51:12,791
Man missing on tier 2, cell 245!

1453
01:51:12,999 --> 01:51:14,526
Dufresne!

1454
01:51:14,626 --> 01:51:17,771
Come out. You're holding up the show!

1455
01:51:20,173 --> 01:51:24,933
Don't make me come down
or I'll thump your skull for you!

1456
01:51:31,184 --> 01:51:35,088
Damn it, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

1457
01:51:35,188 --> 01:51:38,592
You'd better be sick or dead in there.
I shit you not!

1458
01:51:38,692 --> 01:51:40,692
You hear me?

1459
01:51:46,157 --> 01:51:48,243
Oh, my Holy God.

1460
01:52:05,218 --> 01:52:08,121
I want every man
on this cellblock questioned.

1461
01:52:08,221 --> 01:52:11,281
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

1462
01:52:13,393 --> 01:52:15,393
Open 237.

1463
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:22,886
What do you mean, "He just wasn't here"?
Don't say that to me.

1464
01:52:22,986 --> 01:52:24,429
Don't tell me that again.

1465
01:52:24,529 --> 01:52:25,680
But sir, he wasn't.

1466
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:29,242
I can see that, Haig!
Think I'm blind?

1467
01:52:29,910 --> 01:52:31,436
Is that what you're saying?

1468
01:52:31,536 --> 01:52:34,206
- Am I blind, Haig?
- No, sir!

1469
01:52:35,081 --> 01:52:37,584
What about you. You blind?

1470
01:52:38,084 --> 01:52:40,779
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

1471
01:52:40,879 --> 01:52:44,282
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. Right there.

1472
01:52:44,382 --> 01:52:46,382
"Dufresne. "

1473
01:52:47,385 --> 01:52:48,995
He was in his cell...

1474
01:52:49,095 --> 01:52:50,163
...at lights out.

1475
01:52:50,263 --> 01:52:53,458
Reasonable he'd be here in the morning.

1476
01:52:53,558 --> 01:52:55,293
I want him found.

1477
01:52:55,393 --> 01:52:58,855
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast. Now!

1478
01:52:59,105 --> 01:53:01,105
Yes, sir.

1479
01:53:01,274 --> 01:53:03,568
Let's go. Move your butts.

1480
01:53:06,947 --> 01:53:08,947
Stand.

1481
01:53:09,407 --> 01:53:11,407
Well?

1482
01:53:13,912 --> 01:53:15,021
Well, what?

1483
01:53:15,121 --> 01:53:19,526
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

1484
01:53:19,626 --> 01:53:21,778
He must have said something.

1485
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:23,697
No, sir, Warden.

1486
01:53:23,797 --> 01:53:25,797
Not a word.

1487
01:53:26,591 --> 01:53:29,135
Lord, it's a miracle!

1488
01:53:29,761 --> 01:53:32,906
Man vanished like a fart in the wind.

1489
01:53:32,973 --> 01:53:34,973
Nothing left...

1490
01:53:34,975 --> 01:53:37,836
...but some damn rocks on a windowsill.

1491
01:53:37,936 --> 01:53:40,756
And that cupcake on the wall.
Let's ask her.

1492
01:53:40,856 --> 01:53:42,856
Maybe she knows.

1493
01:53:42,858 --> 01:53:47,023
What say there, fuzzy-britches?
Feel like talking?

1494
01:53:47,028 --> 01:53:48,805
Guess not.

1495
01:53:48,905 --> 01:53:51,625
Why should she be any different?

1496
01:53:52,158 --> 01:53:54,158
This is a conspiracy.

1497
01:53:54,494 --> 01:53:56,494
That's what this is.

1498
01:53:56,913 --> 01:54:00,625
One big, damn conspiracy!

1499
01:54:00,917 --> 01:54:02,957
And everyone's in on it!

1500
01:54:03,545 --> 01:54:05,545
Including her!

1501
01:54:39,748 --> 01:54:41,566
In 1966...

1502
01:54:41,666 --> 01:54:44,044
...Andy Dufresne escaped...

1503
01:54:44,252 --> 01:54:46,377
...from Shawshank Prison.

1504
01:54:48,048 --> 01:54:51,159
All they found
was a muddy set of prison clothes...

1505
01:54:51,259 --> 01:54:52,911
...a bar of soap...

1506
01:54:53,011 --> 01:54:54,663
...and an old rock hammer...

1507
01:54:54,763 --> 01:54:57,653
...damn near worn down to the nub.

1508
01:55:01,728 --> 01:55:07,050
I had thought it'd take a man 600 years
to tunnel through the wall with it.

1509
01:55:07,150 --> 01:55:09,870
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

1510
01:55:28,088 --> 01:55:30,382
Oh, Andy loved geology.

1511
01:55:31,132 --> 01:55:34,619
I imagine it appealed to his
meticulous nature.

1512
01:55:34,719 --> 01:55:36,719
An ice age here...

1513
01:55:36,972 --> 01:55:40,375
...million years of mountain building there.

1514
01:55:40,475 --> 01:55:44,045
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

1515
01:55:44,145 --> 01:55:46,525
That's all it takes, really.

1516
01:55:46,898 --> 01:55:48,508
Pressure...

1517
01:55:48,608 --> 01:55:50,608
...and time.

1518
01:55:51,236 --> 01:55:53,786
That and a big goddamn poster.

1519
01:55:57,325 --> 01:55:58,685
Like I said...

1520
01:55:58,785 --> 01:56:04,055
...in prison, a man will do anything
to keep his mind occupied.

1521
01:56:05,584 --> 01:56:10,822
Seems Andy's favorite hobby was toting
his wall out into the exercise yard...

1522
01:56:10,922 --> 01:56:12,922
...a handful at a time.

1523
01:56:14,134 --> 01:56:16,328
I guess after Tommy was killed...

1524
01:56:16,428 --> 01:56:19,498
...Andy decided
he'd been here long enough.

1525
01:56:19,598 --> 01:56:22,403
Lickety-split.
I want to get home.

1526
01:56:22,893 --> 01:56:25,358
I'm just about finished, sir.

1527
01:56:46,374 --> 01:56:48,374
Three deposits tonight.

1528
01:56:55,634 --> 01:56:57,928
Andy did like he was told.

1529
01:56:58,136 --> 01:57:01,706
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror-shine.

1530
01:57:05,310 --> 01:57:07,796
The guards simply didn't notice.

1531
01:57:07,896 --> 01:57:09,464
Neither did I.

1532
01:57:09,564 --> 01:57:11,216
I mean, seriously...

1533
01:57:11,316 --> 01:57:15,396
...how often do you really look
at a man's shoes?

1534
01:59:17,859 --> 01:59:21,179
Andy crawled to freedom
through 500 yards...

1535
01:59:21,279 --> 01:59:25,444
...of shit-smelling foulness
I can't even imagine.

1536
01:59:25,617 --> 01:59:27,997
Or maybe just don't want to.

1537
01:59:32,332 --> 01:59:34,709
Five hundred yards.

1538
01:59:35,210 --> 01:59:38,780
That's the length of five football fields.

1539
01:59:38,922 --> 01:59:41,466
Just shy of half a mile.

1540
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:41,510
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her secret...

1541
02:00:41,610 --> 02:00:44,596
...a man nobody ever laid eyes on before...

1542
02:00:44,696 --> 02:00:47,766
...strolled into the Maine National Bank.

1543
02:00:47,866 --> 02:00:51,036
Until that moment,
he didn't exist.

1544
02:00:51,578 --> 02:00:54,272
- Except on paper.
- May I help you?

1545
02:00:54,372 --> 02:00:56,399
He had all the proper ID...

1546
02:00:56,499 --> 02:01:00,529
...driver's license, birth certificate,
Social Security card...

1547
02:01:00,629 --> 02:01:03,281
And the signature was a spot-on match.

1548
02:01:03,381 --> 02:01:06,576
I must say I'm sorry
to be losing your business.

1549
02:01:06,676 --> 02:01:09,121
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

1550
02:01:09,221 --> 02:01:10,872
Thank you.

1551
02:01:10,972 --> 02:01:12,972
I'm sure I will.

1552
02:01:13,058 --> 02:01:16,503
Here's your cashier's check, sir.
Will there be anything else?

1553
02:01:16,603 --> 02:01:18,046
Please.

1554
02:01:18,146 --> 02:01:21,049
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

1555
02:01:21,149 --> 02:01:23,149
I'd be happy to.

1556
02:01:24,152 --> 02:01:26,152
Good day, sir.

1557
02:01:26,446 --> 02:01:31,226
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

1558
02:01:31,326 --> 02:01:33,019
All told, he blew town...

1559
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:37,958
...with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

1560
02:01:38,667 --> 02:01:41,419
Severance pay for 19 years.

1561
02:01:48,677 --> 02:01:51,652
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

1562
02:02:43,732 --> 02:02:46,843
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

1563
02:02:46,943 --> 02:02:51,723
If you give up this right, anything you
say can be held against you in court.

1564
02:02:51,823 --> 02:02:56,394
I wasn't there to see, but I hear
Byron Hadley sobbed like a girl...

1565
02:02:56,494 --> 02:02:58,789
...when they took him away.

1566
02:03:03,877 --> 02:03:07,702
Norton had no intention
of going that quietly.

1567
02:03:23,104 --> 02:03:24,631
Samuel Norton.

1568
02:03:24,731 --> 02:03:28,386
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

1569
02:03:31,905 --> 02:03:33,473
Open the door.

1570
02:03:33,573 --> 02:03:35,573
I'm not sure which key.

1571
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:47,765
Make it easy on yourself, Norton!

1572
02:03:58,431 --> 02:04:02,002
I like to think the last thing
that went through his head...

1573
02:04:02,102 --> 02:04:03,795
...other than that bullet...

1574
02:04:03,895 --> 02:04:09,675
...was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

1575
02:04:10,819 --> 02:04:14,473
Not long after the warden
deprived us of his company...

1576
02:04:14,573 --> 02:04:17,293
...I got a postcard in the mail.

1577
02:04:18,118 --> 02:04:21,021
It was blank,
but the postmark said...

1578
02:04:21,121 --> 02:04:23,248
...Fort Hancock, Texas.

1579
02:04:23,790 --> 02:04:25,358
Fort Hancock...

1580
02:04:25,458 --> 02:04:27,458
...right on the border.

1581
02:04:27,586 --> 02:04:29,796
That's where Andy crossed.

1582
02:04:30,130 --> 02:04:34,534
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down...

1583
02:04:34,634 --> 02:04:37,014
...it always makes me laugh.

1584
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:40,540
Andy Dufresne...

1585
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:42,751
...who crawled through a river of shit...

1586
02:04:42,851 --> 02:04:46,004
...and came out clean on the other side.

1587
02:04:46,104 --> 02:04:48,104
Andy Dufresne...

1588
02:04:48,273 --> 02:04:50,483
...headed for the Pacific.

1589
02:04:52,819 --> 02:04:55,097
Hadley's got him by the throat, right?

1590
02:04:55,197 --> 02:04:59,101
He says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident. "

1591
02:04:59,201 --> 02:05:02,646
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

1592
02:05:02,746 --> 02:05:04,564
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

1593
02:05:04,664 --> 02:05:07,859
"My friends could use a couple of beers. "

1594
02:05:07,959 --> 02:05:09,959
And he got it!

1595
02:05:10,837 --> 02:05:13,407
Sometimes it makes me sad, though...

1596
02:05:13,507 --> 02:05:15,507
...Andy being gone.

1597
02:05:15,675 --> 02:05:20,163
I have to remind myself that
some birds aren't meant to be caged.

1598
02:05:20,263 --> 02:05:23,238
Their feathers are just too bright.

1599
02:05:24,017 --> 02:05:26,142
And when they fly away...

1600
02:05:26,186 --> 02:05:31,591
...the part of you that knows it was
a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

1601
02:05:31,691 --> 02:05:33,301
But still...

1602
02:05:33,401 --> 02:05:39,776
...the place you live in is that much
more drab and empty that they're gone.

1603
02:05:41,952 --> 02:05:44,332
I guess just miss my friend.

1604
02:06:09,020 --> 02:06:11,020
Please sit down.

1605
02:06:15,777 --> 02:06:17,777
Ellis Boyd Redding...

1606
02:06:17,904 --> 02:06:21,850
...your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

1607
02:06:21,950 --> 02:06:24,925
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

1608
02:06:25,954 --> 02:06:27,954
Rehabilitated?

1609
02:06:29,583 --> 02:06:31,583
Well, now, let me see.

1610
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:35,690
I don't have any idea what that means.

1611
02:06:36,923 --> 02:06:39,659
It means you're ready to rejoin society-

1612
02:06:39,759 --> 02:06:42,989
I know what you think it means, sonny.

1613
02:06:44,264 --> 02:06:46,899
To me it's just a made-up word.

1614
02:06:47,601 --> 02:06:50,151
A politician's word so that...

1615
02:06:50,353 --> 02:06:54,257
...young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie...

1616
02:06:54,357 --> 02:06:56,357
...and have a job.

1617
02:06:57,944 --> 02:07:00,664
What do you really want to know?

1618
02:07:00,780 --> 02:07:02,990
Am I sorry for what I did?

1619
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:05,200
Well, are you?

1620
02:07:06,286 --> 02:07:10,111
There's not a day goes by
I don't feel regret.

1621
02:07:10,457 --> 02:07:14,962
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

1622
02:07:17,422 --> 02:07:20,482
I look back on the way I was then...

1623
02:07:22,093 --> 02:07:24,093
...a young...

1624
02:07:24,387 --> 02:07:28,382
...stupid kid who committed
that terrible crime.

1625
02:07:30,894 --> 02:07:32,894
I want to talk to him.

1626
02:07:34,523 --> 02:07:37,634
I want to try and talk some sense to him.

1627
02:07:37,734 --> 02:07:40,114
Tell him the way things are.

1628
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:43,780
But I can't.

1629
02:07:45,408 --> 02:07:47,410
That kid's long gone...

1630
02:07:48,620 --> 02:07:51,935
...and this old man is all that's left.

1631
02:07:52,791 --> 02:07:54,831
I got to live with that.

1632
02:07:55,627 --> 02:07:57,627
Rehabilitated?

1633
02:07:57,671 --> 02:07:59,881
It's just a bullshit word.

1634
02:08:00,465 --> 02:08:06,075
So you go on and stamp your forms,
sonny, and stop wasting my time.

1635
02:08:06,471 --> 02:08:08,957
Because to tell you the truth...

1636
02:08:09,057 --> 02:08:11,059
...I don't give a shit.

1637
02:09:37,604 --> 02:09:39,604
Here you go, miss.

1638
02:09:41,942 --> 02:09:43,942
Restroom break?

1639
02:09:48,782 --> 02:09:54,817
You don't need to ask me every time
you need to go take a piss. Just go.

1640
02:10:06,341 --> 02:10:10,162
Forty years I've been asking
permission to piss.

1641
02:10:10,262 --> 02:10:13,492
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

1642
02:10:16,768 --> 02:10:19,318
There's a harsh truth to face.

1643
02:10:20,605 --> 02:10:24,260
No way I'm going to make it on the outside.

1644
02:10:31,366 --> 02:10:35,771
All I do anymore is think of ways
to break my parole...

1645
02:10:35,871 --> 02:10:38,591
...so maybe they'd send me back.

1646
02:10:43,545 --> 02:10:46,265
Terrible thing, to live in fear.

1647
02:10:46,882 --> 02:10:48,658
Brooks Hatlen knew it.

1648
02:10:48,758 --> 02:10:50,758
Knew it all too well.

1649
02:10:52,304 --> 02:10:56,041
All I want is to be back
where things make sense.

1650
02:10:56,141 --> 02:10:59,966
Where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

1651
02:11:00,854 --> 02:11:03,231
Only one thing stops me.

1652
02:11:04,649 --> 02:11:07,068
A promise I made to Andy.

1653
02:11:27,589 --> 02:11:29,589
There it is.

1654
02:11:39,351 --> 02:11:41,351
Much obliged, sir.

1655
02:15:20,322 --> 02:15:21,723
Dear Red:

1656
02:15:21,823 --> 02:15:24,392
If you're reading this,
you've gotten out...

1657
02:15:24,492 --> 02:15:28,730
...and if you've come this far,
maybe you'd come a bit further.

1658
02:15:28,830 --> 02:15:32,570
You remember the name
of the town, don't you?

1659
02:15:33,585 --> 02:15:35,585
Zihuatanejo.

1660
02:15:36,755 --> 02:15:40,742
I could use a good man
to help me get my project on wheels.

1661
02:15:40,842 --> 02:15:45,080
I'll keep an eye out for you,
and the chessboard ready.

1662
02:15:45,180 --> 02:15:46,832
Remember, Red...

1663
02:15:46,932 --> 02:15:49,142
...hope is a good thing...

1664
02:15:49,226 --> 02:15:51,336
...maybe the best of things.

1665
02:15:51,436 --> 02:15:53,816
And no good thing ever dies.

1666
02:15:54,105 --> 02:15:57,092
I will be hoping that this letter finds you...

1667
02:15:57,192 --> 02:15:59,192
...and finds you well.

1668
02:15:59,444 --> 02:16:00,762
Your friend...

1669
02:16:00,862 --> 02:16:02,862
...Andy.

1670
02:16:35,856 --> 02:16:37,716
"Get busy living...

1671
02:16:37,816 --> 02:16:39,816
...or get busy dying. "

1672
02:16:42,404 --> 02:16:44,573
That's goddamn right.

1673
02:16:49,828 --> 02:16:52,063
For the second time in my life...

1674
02:16:52,163 --> 02:16:55,223
...I'm guilty of committing a crime.

1675
02:16:55,834 --> 02:16:57,834
Parole violation.

1676
02:16:58,420 --> 02:17:02,657
Of course I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

1677
02:17:02,757 --> 02:17:04,910
Not for an old crook like me.

1678
02:17:05,010 --> 02:17:07,390
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

1679
02:17:10,682 --> 02:17:15,754
I find I'm so excited I can barely
sit still or hold a thought in my head.

1680
02:17:15,854 --> 02:17:19,299
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

1681
02:17:19,399 --> 02:17:22,010
A free man at the start of a long journey...

1682
02:17:22,110 --> 02:17:24,915
...whose conclusion is uncertain.

1683
02:17:27,699 --> 02:17:31,014
I hope I can make it across the border.

1684
02:17:31,870 --> 02:17:35,525
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

1685
02:17:36,791 --> 02:17:41,636
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

1686
02:17:42,714 --> 02:17:44,714
I hope.
