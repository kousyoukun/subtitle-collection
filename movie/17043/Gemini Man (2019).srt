1
00:01:41,603 --> 00:01:43,817
Car number 6, we are moving.

2
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:47,032
"4 alpha", repeat, "4 alpha".

3
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:49,010
Window seat, his
team's on all sides.

4
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,192
Copy that.

5
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,310
Speed?

6
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:55,224
238 km/h and holding steady.

7
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:57,291
You alright over there?

8
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,891
I do love getting
me some bad guys.

9
00:03:13,717 --> 00:03:15,760
Wait! Wait!
Civilian in play, I repeat

10
00:03:15,761 --> 00:03:17,064
civilian in play.

11
00:03:34,818 --> 00:03:35,818
- Clear.
- Confirm.

12
00:03:36,249 --> 00:03:37,529
Confirmed. Clear, code green.

13
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,000
Are we shipping to
the same place?

14
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,030
Yes, sir.

15
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,469
Alright.

16
00:03:53,869 --> 00:03:55,475
That was your best ever.

17
00:03:56,006 --> 00:03:57,143
I was... I was impressed.

18
00:03:57,435 --> 00:03:58,765
Where I hit him?

19
00:03:59,147 --> 00:04:00,147
Neck.

20
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:02,514
On a moving train.

21
00:04:04,027 --> 00:04:05,878
- You took a video?
- Yeah, I took video.

22
00:04:05,902 --> 00:04:07,333
Man, meet everybody else, look.

23
00:04:16,429 --> 00:04:17,695
- Delete it.
- Henry.

24
00:04:17,882 --> 00:04:19,304
Come on, listen.

25
00:04:19,932 --> 00:04:21,972
4 shooters wift on this guy
before you got the call.

26
00:04:22,062 --> 00:04:23,062
Alright, 4.

27
00:04:23,121 --> 00:04:24,421
All of 'em studs.

28
00:04:24,676 --> 00:04:26,340
And you bring him off.

29
00:04:27,031 --> 00:04:28,100
That was beautiful, alright.

30
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,673
I got emotional, tear fell.

31
00:04:30,004 --> 00:04:31,004
Delete it.

32
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:32,312
I'll delete it.

33
00:04:32,547 --> 00:04:34,100
I'll delete it, alright.

34
00:05:22,493 --> 00:05:23,611
Can't do this.

35
00:05:25,499 --> 00:05:27,099
What's up, my brother?

36
00:05:28,145 --> 00:05:29,455
You alright?

37
00:05:31,318 --> 00:05:32,501
I got him in his neck.

38
00:05:32,828 --> 00:05:34,762
But I was aiming at his head.

39
00:05:35,426 --> 00:05:37,456
Other lines of work
you can lose a step.

40
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:38,365
Not this one.

41
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:40,997
You still the best we got.
Best anyone's got.

42
00:05:41,419 --> 00:05:42,774
Believe me, I keep track.

43
00:05:42,903 --> 00:05:44,156
Not a soda, not today.

44
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,950
- Meaning?
- Give me a beer.

45
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,490
Are you sure?

46
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,380
- Are you really retiring?
- Yes, sir.

47
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,944
Then I'm sure.

48
00:05:51,099 --> 00:05:52,099
Okay.

49
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:57,822
A lot of guys can shoot, Dell.

50
00:05:59,523 --> 00:06:02,163
They aren't you, they don't
have the history you do.

51
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,982
Yeah, I think the... the history

52
00:06:04,159 --> 00:06:05,430
might be the problem.

53
00:06:06,231 --> 00:06:07,231
Henry.

54
00:06:08,783 --> 00:06:10,583
We've been through a lot
together, you and me.

55
00:06:11,009 --> 00:06:12,419
We do world safer.

56
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,039
I just not gonna trust a
new guy like I trust you.

57
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:21,229
There was a kid...

58
00:06:21,993 --> 00:06:24,051
beautiful little girl.

59
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,021
Right next to him.

60
00:06:26,871 --> 00:06:29,821
If I'm 6 inches off -

61
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:32,954
she's dead.

62
00:06:33,684 --> 00:06:35,254
Understand?

63
00:06:35,914 --> 00:06:37,284
This time

64
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:40,524
I got lucky.

65
00:06:41,414 --> 00:06:43,404
I didn't feel the shot.

66
00:06:44,414 --> 00:06:46,424
Not like I should have.

67
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:49,874
72 kills, Dell.

68
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:53,054
That shit starts to
mess with you a little bit.

69
00:06:55,004 --> 00:06:57,194
Deep down it's like...

70
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,428
my soul was hurt.

71
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:03,162
I just want some peace.

72
00:07:06,652 --> 00:07:08,512
So, what do I do now?

73
00:07:10,982 --> 00:07:12,712
Wish me well.

74
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:34,433
Good morning.

75
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,203
Hey, where's Jerry?

76
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:37,412
Jerry retired.

77
00:07:37,643 --> 00:07:39,577
They couldn't take anymore
of his bustling pace.

78
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:40,717
I'm Danny.

79
00:07:41,713 --> 00:07:43,383
Hey Danny, I'm Henry.

80
00:07:44,803 --> 00:07:47,943
I owe you $23.46.

81
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,383
Okay, thank you, Henry.

82
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:53,583
So, what are you fishing for?

83
00:07:53,983 --> 00:07:55,453
Peace and quiet

84
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,409
and mackerel.

85
00:07:57,998 --> 00:07:59,448
Head now to Preachers Point?

86
00:07:59,976 --> 00:08:01,486
Is that what you recommend?

87
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,514
Well, seems like a
nice enough day for it.

88
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:14,572
Not much of a "live and let live"
guy, I take it.

89
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,765
I'm deathly allergic to bees.

90
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,327
You a student or
just a fish whisperer?

91
00:08:20,626 --> 00:08:22,823
I'm working my way
to grad school.

92
00:08:22,824 --> 00:08:23,824
Marine biology.

93
00:08:24,988 --> 00:08:26,408
UGA, Darian?

94
00:08:26,668 --> 00:08:28,108
Go dogs.

95
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:30,069
Well, you be careful around here.

96
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,110
There is some dogs out
on these docks too.

97
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,610
Nothing I can't handle.

98
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:54,476
Well, I guess I don't
have to ask how business is.

99
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:57,455
Could have been yours.

100
00:08:57,938 --> 00:08:59,788
Only asked you 10 times.

101
00:09:04,198 --> 00:09:05,518
Hey brother.

102
00:09:06,578 --> 00:09:09,388
- It's good to see you, Henry.
- You too, Jack.

103
00:09:11,088 --> 00:09:13,468
What you doing there?
Feeling sexy?

104
00:09:15,028 --> 00:09:17,068
- Thanks for coming so quickly.
- Of course.

105
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,970
- You still married?
- Yup.

106
00:09:20,196 --> 00:09:22,796
Wife's on a shopping
trip to Paris.

107
00:09:23,233 --> 00:09:24,946
Son's in boarding school.

108
00:09:25,474 --> 00:09:26,202
You?

109
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:29,092
No, no wife, no kids, no Paris.

110
00:09:30,095 --> 00:09:31,885
Here's to the next war -

111
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:33,975
- which is no war.
- Which is no war.

112
00:09:39,175 --> 00:09:40,635
So, what've you got?

113
00:09:46,395 --> 00:09:47,865
Recognise him?

114
00:09:49,895 --> 00:09:50,994
Who's asking?

115
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,519
Your old friend who's afraid
you're in trouble.

116
00:09:54,978 --> 00:09:56,388
Do you?

117
00:09:57,956 --> 00:09:59,466
I AMF'ed him in Liège.

118
00:09:59,589 --> 00:10:01,256
They tell you who he was?

119
00:10:02,138 --> 00:10:04,198
Valery Dormov. Terrorist.

120
00:10:04,249 --> 00:10:05,249
No.

121
00:10:05,866 --> 00:10:08,695
Valery Dormov.
Molecular biologist.

122
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:12,773
Who worked here in the
States for 30 years.

123
00:10:14,095 --> 00:10:15,229
I read his file.

124
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:16,859
Bio-terrorist.

125
00:10:17,495 --> 00:10:19,462
The file was spiked.

126
00:10:19,985 --> 00:10:21,378
I don't know by who.

127
00:10:21,925 --> 00:10:23,181
Why?

128
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,027
I don't know that, either.

129
00:10:25,214 --> 00:10:26,884
Where are you getting this from?

130
00:10:27,834 --> 00:10:29,454
A friend.

131
00:10:30,044 --> 00:10:31,044
From the other side.

132
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:31,734
Alright, well.

133
00:10:31,735 --> 00:10:33,934
- I need to talk to him.
- Sure.

134
00:10:34,524 --> 00:10:36,658
Skype? Facetime?

135
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:40,315
I need to talk to him, Jack.

136
00:10:42,265 --> 00:10:43,985
Oh, what a hell.

137
00:10:44,135 --> 00:10:45,645
He owes me.

138
00:10:51,146 --> 00:10:52,819
I hope I'm wrong.

139
00:10:54,126 --> 00:10:55,916
I just want you to be careful.

140
00:11:04,085 --> 00:11:07,588
It's me got full of things
I didn't do in my DIA years.

141
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:12,156
You think you didn't do that
in your DIA years?

142
00:11:14,964 --> 00:11:16,304
This guy.

143
00:11:22,124 --> 00:11:23,444
They tell you who he was?

144
00:11:24,441 --> 00:11:26,564
Valery Dormov. Terrorist.

145
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:27,959
No.

146
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,902
Valery Dormov.
Molecular biologist.

147
00:11:30,903 --> 00:11:34,680
Who worked here in
the States for 30 years.

148
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:39,278
You took a real
risk contacting me.

149
00:11:39,326 --> 00:11:40,326
I wish you hadn't.

150
00:11:40,785 --> 00:11:42,626
What was I supposed to do?

151
00:11:42,903 --> 00:11:43,903
I love you, brother.

152
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:47,147
You too.

153
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:50,568
It's a pitty.

154
00:11:51,174 --> 00:11:52,608
I've always liked Henry.

155
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:54,233
Henry is DIA, Clay.

156
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:55,505
He's one of mine.

157
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,017
He knows you lied to him.

158
00:11:57,018 --> 00:11:58,423
We have a tail on him.

159
00:11:58,424 --> 00:12:01,613
Standard protocol for retirement.
He'll be contained.

160
00:12:01,895 --> 00:12:04,095
Contained? Henry Brogan?

161
00:12:05,216 --> 00:12:07,354
He has Dormov's contact.

162
00:12:07,991 --> 00:12:12,231
He's gonna pull on that thread
until he's pointing a gun at our faces.

163
00:12:13,045 --> 00:12:15,423
What about his handler,
the bald guy?

164
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:16,224
Patterson?

165
00:12:16,225 --> 00:12:19,234
He won't be happy, but he
won't cross me, he'll fall in line.

166
00:12:19,354 --> 00:12:20,999
I'll tie this off.

167
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:23,524
Make it look like a Russian op.

168
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:24,975
You'll do nothing!

169
00:12:25,134 --> 00:12:26,929
I'll tell my team
that Henry's gone rogue.

170
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,114
I can handle this.

171
00:12:28,115 --> 00:12:30,069
Right after you wift
4 times on Dormov.

172
00:12:30,198 --> 00:12:32,023
No. You need Gemini.

173
00:12:32,465 --> 00:12:35,075
I will not let you do hints
on American soil.

174
00:12:35,165 --> 00:12:38,096
You don't have anyone
who can take on Henry Brogan.

175
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:40,146
I do.

176
00:12:41,452 --> 00:12:43,992
We'll clean up our
own messes, thank you.

177
00:12:44,542 --> 00:12:49,036
Everything that we worked for is
at stake thanks to your failures.

178
00:12:49,037 --> 00:12:51,667
You have one chance
not to screw this up.

179
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:53,602
Please.

180
00:12:54,972 --> 00:12:56,482
Surprise me.

181
00:13:42,516 --> 00:13:43,996
Any luck?

182
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:48,126
Okay.

183
00:13:48,464 --> 00:13:51,398
Most guys try flowers or a
playlist they think I'll find romantic.

184
00:13:51,399 --> 00:13:52,819
Are you DIA?

185
00:13:54,142 --> 00:13:56,168
That depends what's DIA?

186
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,920
Dance Instructors of America.

187
00:13:58,687 --> 00:14:00,509
Did Patterson send you
to surveil me?

188
00:14:01,457 --> 00:14:03,691
- Patterson?
- Del Patterson?

189
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:06,232
Funny coincidence,
he was just here.

190
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,870
Look, you're burnt.

191
00:14:07,871 --> 00:14:09,204
Your cover's blown.

192
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:11,460
Okay, well I was just...

193
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:12,869
in the middle of
Marvin Gaye song,

194
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,016
so I'm gonna go back to that.

195
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,310
Name 3 buildings on a
Darian Campus.

196
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,477
- Really?
- Come on, marine biologist.

197
00:14:20,468 --> 00:14:22,711
Rhodes Hall, McCourter Hall, Rocker Hall.

198
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:23,947
Now I know you're DIA.

199
00:14:24,385 --> 00:14:26,161
Civilian would've told
me to piss off.

200
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:27,976
Not a polite civilian.

201
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:30,995
You good, you good.

202
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:32,196
Where you live?

203
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:33,483
What?

204
00:14:33,786 --> 00:14:35,392
No, I wanna see your place.

205
00:14:36,390 --> 00:14:37,390
Excuse me?

206
00:14:37,648 --> 00:14:40,606
Where, I am sure I
won't find a single book

207
00:14:40,607 --> 00:14:41,740
on marine biology.

208
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:45,952
But I'm certain I'll find a
big ol' fold on Henry Brogan.

209
00:14:45,953 --> 00:14:47,293
Excuse me?

210
00:14:47,403 --> 00:14:50,393
Okay, this has been fun,
but I kinda have to do that job.

211
00:14:50,473 --> 00:14:51,623
Sorry, sir.

212
00:14:51,773 --> 00:14:53,231
Yeah, I got the
30-feet bowrider.

213
00:14:53,232 --> 00:14:55,507
- Okay.
- Needs some gas and... Hey, sir.

214
00:14:55,607 --> 00:14:56,607
One sec.

215
00:14:59,007 --> 00:15:02,182
I'm sorry, I...
Can I buy you a drink?

216
00:15:03,304 --> 00:15:05,254
Why, so you can keep
interrogating me?

217
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,754
No, I'm probably gonna
spend the whole time apologising.

218
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:10,575
Pelican Point?

219
00:15:10,764 --> 00:15:12,899
Sunday nights,
they have a great band.

220
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,760
Please, what time do
you get off work?

221
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,030
- 7.
- Think I also need a 12-volt bilge pump.

222
00:15:23,110 --> 00:15:24,554
Alright, I'll see you at 7.

223
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,807
Just leave the crazy
at home, please.

224
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:29,008
Alright.

225
00:15:49,851 --> 00:15:50,897
Sorry about earlier.

226
00:15:51,232 --> 00:15:53,965
Bad habits.
I don't trust people easily.

227
00:15:54,232 --> 00:15:55,832
But I'm sure you don't either.

228
00:15:57,032 --> 00:15:58,602
Why would you say that?

229
00:16:08,232 --> 00:16:09,804
Where did you get that?

230
00:16:10,018 --> 00:16:13,790
25 years of faithful service
you make some friends.

231
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:17,235
Now I'm burnt.

232
00:16:18,255 --> 00:16:19,631
Toast.

233
00:16:19,869 --> 00:16:21,970
Is Patterson running you?

234
00:16:28,563 --> 00:16:30,458
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

235
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:35,418
Boilermaker is a cop drink.
You got cops in your family?

236
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:36,933
My dad was FBI.

237
00:16:37,646 --> 00:16:39,794
And pretty big on
serving our country.

238
00:16:40,869 --> 00:16:41,869
Was?

239
00:16:42,273 --> 00:16:43,838
Yeah, he died off duty.

240
00:16:43,989 --> 00:16:45,568
Trying to stop a bank robbery.

241
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:48,327
Sorry about that.

242
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:53,000
File says you were 4 years in Navy
"Fifth Fleet", Bahrain.

243
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,187
Yeah, did love the sea.

244
00:16:55,188 --> 00:16:58,497
Didn't love being stuck on a tin can with
couple of hundreds sailors, though.

245
00:16:58,808 --> 00:16:59,251
Yeah.

246
00:16:59,371 --> 00:17:01,411
Beats a bunker in Mogadishu.

247
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:07,071
So, then DIA.

248
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:09,661
Defence Clandestine Services.

249
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:11,462
Recruiting, running assets.

250
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:14,477
Not a single demerit.

251
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,340
I mean...

252
00:17:16,746 --> 00:17:19,612
So then the Inspector General
sticks you on a dock

253
00:17:19,613 --> 00:17:22,280
to watch a guy who
just wants to retire?

254
00:17:23,601 --> 00:17:25,351
That doesn't bother you?

255
00:17:31,271 --> 00:17:32,924
Well, this is adios, Henry.

256
00:17:33,529 --> 00:17:35,440
It's been nice surveilling you.

257
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:38,046
I'll be sent somewhere
else tomorrow.

258
00:17:38,398 --> 00:17:39,116
Yeah.

259
00:17:39,117 --> 00:17:40,409
You... you want a ride home?

260
00:17:40,613 --> 00:17:43,185
No, thanks, my apartment
is just right over there.

261
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:49,223
Henry, why are you retiring?

262
00:17:53,085 --> 00:17:57,735
I'm finding myself avoiding
mirrors lately, so...

263
00:17:58,417 --> 00:18:00,457
I'm gonna take that as a sign.

264
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:02,958
Watch your six out there.

265
00:18:03,331 --> 00:18:04,331
You too.

266
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,851
Night, Toast.

267
00:18:17,515 --> 00:18:19,663
You should come
look at the stars, Jack.

268
00:19:10,045 --> 00:19:12,042
- You have to work on your kick.
- Charlie.

269
00:19:12,193 --> 00:19:13,504
- Concentrate, Henry.
- Come one!

270
00:19:13,528 --> 00:19:15,201
You are 5 now and this
is not hard.

271
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:16,964
Now. Try again.

272
00:20:07,326 --> 00:20:09,276
Hi, this is Jack, I'm sailing.

273
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,167
Please tell me this means
we're back in business.

274
00:20:17,322 --> 00:20:18,322
Where are you?

275
00:20:18,594 --> 00:20:20,082
Just some guy.
I'm on surveliance.

276
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:21,083
Get out of there, now!

277
00:20:21,205 --> 00:20:23,810
Do not go home, do not
go to your girl's house.

278
00:20:23,811 --> 00:20:26,312
Go to the bus station,
get a ticket, in cash.

279
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,428
Do not use ATM.
Go somewhere where nobody knows you.

280
00:20:29,978 --> 00:20:31,158
You sure?

281
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:34,776
They're outside my window, sorry man
I made you a loose end.

282
00:20:34,807 --> 00:20:35,899
Come on man, I'll be fine.

283
00:20:36,045 --> 00:20:37,192
How do I contact with you?

284
00:20:37,193 --> 00:20:39,233
You don't.
Don't contact anybody.

285
00:20:39,313 --> 00:20:40,633
Especially anybody from the DIA.

286
00:20:40,713 --> 00:20:42,563
And get rid of your phone. Now.

287
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:44,095
Oh, come on, Henry. Stop.

288
00:20:46,299 --> 00:20:47,549
Marino?

289
00:21:17,483 --> 00:21:19,114
It's not gun time.

290
00:21:19,558 --> 00:21:20,691
It's coffee time.

291
00:21:21,932 --> 00:21:22,932
Do you have a burn bag?

292
00:21:22,982 --> 00:21:24,975
First, tell me what
you're doing here.

293
00:21:24,976 --> 00:21:26,978
Somebody just sent
a team to kill me.

294
00:21:28,263 --> 00:21:29,763
And you're still asleep.

295
00:21:30,002 --> 00:21:32,342
That means you didn't
know about it, correct?

296
00:21:32,422 --> 00:21:34,415
No, of course not.
I would've told you.

297
00:21:38,722 --> 00:21:40,448
That means you're next.

298
00:21:41,222 --> 00:21:42,222
Get dressed.

299
00:21:45,828 --> 00:21:48,470
All the boats have dupe keys
in the office, right?

300
00:21:48,848 --> 00:21:50,328
You got a fast one?

301
00:22:00,028 --> 00:22:01,738
Feeling the call of the sea?

302
00:22:05,828 --> 00:22:07,078
Where is he?

303
00:22:07,828 --> 00:22:09,028
You can tell me now.

304
00:22:10,448 --> 00:22:11,478
Hey, drop!

305
00:22:13,716 --> 00:22:14,976
Bitch!

306
00:22:15,796 --> 00:22:19,446
You can tell me now, or you can
tell me in 5 minutes minus your teeth.

307
00:22:19,576 --> 00:22:20,949
But you gonna tell me.

308
00:22:38,302 --> 00:22:39,302
I counted 3.

309
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:40,658
How many did you bring?

310
00:23:05,881 --> 00:23:06,996
Who sent you?

311
00:23:07,571 --> 00:23:10,357
You can tell me now or you
can tell me in 5 minutes...

312
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:11,838
minus your teeth.

313
00:23:17,839 --> 00:23:19,039
You alright?

314
00:23:19,979 --> 00:23:21,923
- It's Lassiter.
- How do you know?

315
00:23:36,979 --> 00:23:38,389
You get on this boat
you leave behind

316
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,345
everything and
everybody you've ever known.

317
00:23:40,346 --> 00:23:41,588
Do you understand that?

318
00:23:55,322 --> 00:23:56,465
Scared is good.

319
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:58,008
It means you're alert.

320
00:23:58,951 --> 00:24:00,833
Never had anybody
trying to kill me before.

321
00:24:00,977 --> 00:24:03,095
Yeah, well, the important
thing is - you didn't.

322
00:24:05,536 --> 00:24:08,506
What scares you?
Other than bees.

323
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:10,436
Drowning.

324
00:24:38,456 --> 00:24:41,138
So this is you cleaning
up your own messes?

325
00:24:41,139 --> 00:24:42,489
Spare me the lecture.

326
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:45,870
It's like watching the Hindenburg
crash into the Titanic.

327
00:24:45,990 --> 00:24:47,840
Tell me what we're
going to do about Henry.

328
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:50,117
Henry Brogan is like
any other soldier.

329
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,964
When they're young and stupid
they believe anything you tell them.

330
00:24:52,965 --> 00:24:55,449
Then they get older,
they wear out.

331
00:24:56,165 --> 00:24:57,831
Grow a conscious.

332
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:02,442
This is why we need
a new breed of soldier.

333
00:25:04,131 --> 00:25:05,572
Gemini will handle this.

334
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:07,438
I'm sorry, I can't allow that.

335
00:25:07,554 --> 00:25:09,034
I'm not asking your permission.

336
00:25:09,035 --> 00:25:10,642
You wanna go to your bosses?

337
00:25:10,643 --> 00:25:13,642
I am sure they'd love to hear
about our little rogue project.

338
00:25:15,487 --> 00:25:18,022
I'll make it look
like a Russian hit.

339
00:25:18,023 --> 00:25:19,923
You give Henry a state funeral.

340
00:25:20,663 --> 00:25:23,541
Fly on the coffin.
21-gun salute.

341
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:26,619
You give a nice speech,
everyone cries.

342
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:28,290
He'd be remembered as a hero.

343
00:25:28,291 --> 00:25:29,770
Life goes on.

344
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:32,669
- Not for Henry.
- Oh, come on.

345
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:35,714
Muds like Henry look born
into be collateral damage.

346
00:25:36,055 --> 00:25:37,728
Let's not pretend otherwise.

347
00:25:38,647 --> 00:25:40,243
Do you have an asset in place?

348
00:25:40,371 --> 00:25:42,422
I have the trophy asset.

349
00:25:47,749 --> 00:25:48,967
Alright - Just...

350
00:25:49,241 --> 00:25:50,241
No, I'm good.

351
00:25:54,751 --> 00:25:55,751
You hungry?

352
00:25:56,393 --> 00:25:59,250
Yeah, I'm starving, but those
things expired 2 years ago.

353
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:01,995
Really?

354
00:26:02,977 --> 00:26:04,150
Still taste good.

355
00:26:06,362 --> 00:26:09,259
While he still had teeth
that guy said you were the rogue.

356
00:26:10,122 --> 00:26:11,312
And you believed him?

357
00:26:12,691 --> 00:26:14,911
99% sure he was lying.

358
00:26:15,845 --> 00:26:17,672
But 1% sucks, doesn't it?

359
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:25,545
Henry, has this ever
happened to you before?

360
00:26:25,665 --> 00:26:26,697
Which part?

361
00:26:27,124 --> 00:26:29,092
Your own government
trying to kill you.

362
00:26:30,578 --> 00:26:32,128
Nah, that's new.

363
00:26:33,098 --> 00:26:36,228
You've been in agency a while and
can't you guess what this is all about?

364
00:26:36,598 --> 00:26:40,428
Trust me, if I could I would not be
on this lovely vacation with you.

365
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,300
Well.

366
00:26:44,486 --> 00:26:48,036
When I'm the head of the agency we
gonna handle retirement very differently.

367
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,350
My man.

368
00:27:15,667 --> 00:27:17,854
Baron tour is here
to pick up Brogan.

369
00:27:18,107 --> 00:27:19,107
Party of two.

370
00:27:23,714 --> 00:27:25,864
- Good to see you man.
- You too.

371
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,066
Danny, meet the Baron.

372
00:27:28,209 --> 00:27:31,281
Middle-aged reprobate and
best pilot I've ever known.

373
00:27:31,568 --> 00:27:32,834
Danny, Baron.

374
00:27:33,036 --> 00:27:34,036
Hey, Toast.

375
00:27:35,828 --> 00:27:37,408
Got your appliences requested.

376
00:27:37,758 --> 00:27:40,268
For now, you can hold
up to my place at Cartagena.

377
00:27:40,908 --> 00:27:42,408
You'll be anonymous and safe.

378
00:27:42,558 --> 00:27:45,613
Yeah, we're kinda
in the shit here, man.

379
00:27:46,358 --> 00:27:48,134
I think Jack dead.

380
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:52,602
- Jesus.
- Yeah.

381
00:27:53,308 --> 00:27:55,042
- Anyone follow you?
- No.

382
00:27:55,043 --> 00:27:56,585
They will. Let's go.

383
00:27:57,038 --> 00:27:58,989
- Can I have one of those crackers?
- Sure.

384
00:27:59,297 --> 00:28:00,297
Thanks.

385
00:28:10,787 --> 00:28:12,347
Does he do this at home?

386
00:28:12,806 --> 00:28:14,050
I don't think so, I don't know.

387
00:28:14,051 --> 00:28:15,487
- Do you?
- No.

388
00:28:15,488 --> 00:28:18,631
If it's inappropriate to do this
sort of thing at home.

389
00:28:18,632 --> 00:28:21,312
Why would you think it's appropriate
to do it in your science class?

390
00:28:21,380 --> 00:28:24,240
I don't know, probably because
science is so wicked boring.

391
00:28:30,019 --> 00:28:30,877
Hello.

392
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:32,872
Guess you really didn't
want me to retire.

393
00:28:32,873 --> 00:28:35,278
Henry, you're okay! Thank God!

394
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:36,279
Stop it!

395
00:28:37,086 --> 00:28:38,505
Is Marino dead?

396
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:40,358
Yes.

397
00:28:41,635 --> 00:28:42,819
Jack Willis?

398
00:28:43,459 --> 00:28:45,915
It wasn't me. None of this was
me Henry, I swear it.

399
00:28:46,146 --> 00:28:47,146
I trusted you, Dell.

400
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:50,276
You still can. Let me call you
on another line.

401
00:28:55,154 --> 00:28:56,154
You got 30 seconds.

402
00:29:01,231 --> 00:29:02,260
Hey, excuse me.

403
00:29:02,261 --> 00:29:03,583
Could you borrow a
phone for 5 minutes

404
00:29:03,584 --> 00:29:05,584
if I gave you a hundred bucks?

405
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:10,075
We'll start with who's idea
it was to send a team

406
00:29:10,076 --> 00:29:13,071
to agent Zakarweski's apartment,
was that necessary?

407
00:29:13,072 --> 00:29:16,432
Also not my call, she's working
for the Inspector General, not me.

408
00:29:16,502 --> 00:29:17,534
Is she with you?

409
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:18,274
Yes.

410
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,549
Not voluntarily.

411
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:23,025
Okay, listen, this is not something
I wanna say over the phone.

412
00:29:23,203 --> 00:29:25,136
I'm at my kids, goddamn, school!

413
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:27,258
What a hell is all of this?!

414
00:29:29,528 --> 00:29:31,088
We have a problem.

415
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,158
Gemini.

416
00:29:33,258 --> 00:29:36,588
Your old friend, working with
Janet Lassiter and her people.

417
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:38,558
I can't stop them.

418
00:29:40,128 --> 00:29:42,108
Okay, Dormov.

419
00:29:42,508 --> 00:29:44,988
Did he have something
to do with Gemini?

420
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:48,888
Dormov, the guy that you had
me popped on the train.

421
00:29:48,889 --> 00:29:51,239
Because you said he
was a Russian terrorist.

422
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,840
Was he working for Gemini?

423
00:29:53,937 --> 00:29:55,479
Once upon a time.

424
00:29:56,743 --> 00:30:00,223
So you got me pulling
triggers For Clay Verris.

425
00:30:00,442 --> 00:30:03,531
Henry, I regret my
lack of candor, but listen...

426
00:30:03,532 --> 00:30:06,006
How many other times
you do this to me, Dell?

427
00:30:07,131 --> 00:30:08,393
How many times you spiked a file,

428
00:30:08,417 --> 00:30:11,158
send me off to AMF somebody
who didn't deserve it?

429
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,590
Never, ever.
This was the one-off.

430
00:30:13,591 --> 00:30:15,191
I swear on my son's life.

431
00:30:19,178 --> 00:30:20,021
Alright, look.

432
00:30:20,022 --> 00:30:22,453
Agent Zakarweski is
not a part of this.

433
00:30:22,583 --> 00:30:25,614
Henry, we can fix this.
I swear, but I need

434
00:30:25,615 --> 00:30:27,282
both of you to come back.

435
00:30:28,611 --> 00:30:29,834
To what, Dell?

436
00:30:33,095 --> 00:30:35,192
Okay, Gemini.

437
00:30:35,193 --> 00:30:36,189
What do you know about it?

438
00:30:36,190 --> 00:30:38,754
Privatized paramilitary
owned by Clay Verris.

439
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,493
Agency does a lot of
business with them.

440
00:30:40,494 --> 00:30:41,494
Is there more?

441
00:30:42,459 --> 00:30:44,657
Baron and I served under
Verris in the Marines:

442
00:30:44,658 --> 00:30:46,658
in Panama, Kuwait, Somalia.

443
00:30:47,608 --> 00:30:50,923
After he left the military, he started
Gemini and tried to hire us.

444
00:30:50,924 --> 00:30:52,025
We both told him "no".

445
00:30:52,026 --> 00:30:54,456
Except I was smart enough
to move 1500 miles away.

446
00:30:54,576 --> 00:30:55,715
Yeah.

447
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:57,984
I blowed that one.

448
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:16,843
Verris gets billions of
dollars a year to take

449
00:31:16,844 --> 00:31:19,823
out targets in any
way he sees fit.

450
00:31:20,304 --> 00:31:21,721
That's Gemini:

451
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:25,157
off-book kidnappings, tortures.

452
00:31:25,624 --> 00:31:28,610
They who you call when
you need 12 Saudi princes

453
00:31:28,611 --> 00:31:30,853
to quietly disappear.

454
00:31:31,082 --> 00:31:33,733
Or you want somebody
to train your death squads.

455
00:31:35,404 --> 00:31:37,224
6 weeks into Sniper School

456
00:31:37,503 --> 00:31:40,103
Clay Verris takes me out
on this boat for 5 miles.

457
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,752
Ties this weights to my ankles,
tosses me overboard.

458
00:31:43,753 --> 00:31:46,347
Tells me tread water
as long as I can.

459
00:31:47,394 --> 00:31:48,889
And he didn't know
about your fear of...

460
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,902
Of course did.
That was the point.

461
00:31:51,814 --> 00:31:53,435
So what did you do?

462
00:31:57,835 --> 00:32:00,327
I tread water for
as long as I could.

463
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:04,395
And then I drowned.

464
00:32:06,415 --> 00:32:07,745
Dead.

465
00:32:10,415 --> 00:32:12,995
He fished me out,
pat on my chest.

466
00:32:14,545 --> 00:32:18,965
Told me I was now ready
to serve under his command.

467
00:32:23,035 --> 00:32:24,495
A toast.

468
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:30,073
To the next war...

469
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:31,806
- which is no war.
- Which is no war.

470
00:32:31,814 --> 00:32:32,814
No war.

471
00:32:33,594 --> 00:32:34,941
We'll figure out in the morning.

472
00:32:34,942 --> 00:32:36,536
Right now we can use some...

473
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:40,391
Sure, you folks want one room or...
Two.

474
00:32:42,881 --> 00:32:43,881
Two, two.

475
00:32:47,201 --> 00:32:49,881
Yeah, I can put him
in the garage if you want.

476
00:32:49,882 --> 00:32:51,482
Alright, two rooms will be fine.

477
00:32:51,527 --> 00:32:54,465
Just giving you options.
Okay, right this way.

478
00:33:35,318 --> 00:33:38,481
Sniper, rooftop, I leave,
he's gonna follow.

479
00:33:38,924 --> 00:33:40,881
I need you to go with
Baron some place safe.

480
00:33:40,972 --> 00:33:41,972
Alright?

481
00:33:46,436 --> 00:33:48,404
Shooter, on the roof.

482
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:51,862
You are a shiity house
guest, you know that?

483
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:55,201
- How the hell did they find us?
- She's good, she's really good.

484
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,215
She just doesn't know
what she doesn't know.

485
00:33:57,403 --> 00:33:58,891
Take care of her, alright?

486
00:36:17,575 --> 00:36:18,797
Stop right there!

487
00:36:21,495 --> 00:36:22,825
Who are you?

488
00:36:23,885 --> 00:36:25,548
I don't wanna shoot you!

489
00:36:27,145 --> 00:36:28,445
Fine.

490
00:36:28,995 --> 00:36:30,018
Don't shoot me.

491
00:36:30,748 --> 00:36:32,120
But I'm gonna shoot you.

492
00:36:34,333 --> 00:36:36,095
I could have killed
you on the roof.

493
00:36:37,483 --> 00:36:39,233
Maybe you should have.

494
00:36:41,543 --> 00:36:43,803
Did they show you a
picture of me?

495
00:36:44,763 --> 00:36:46,623
Yeah, you look old.

496
00:36:50,643 --> 00:36:53,625
Kid, you take one step closer.

497
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:55,888
You gonna leave me no choice.

498
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,381
Get off! Get off!

499
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:21,186
Move, move!

500
00:38:32,673 --> 00:38:34,032
Get out of the way!

501
00:41:24,279 --> 00:41:26,491
Stop. Stop. Stop!

502
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:46,843
Hands up!

503
00:42:01,814 --> 00:42:03,347
What the hell was that?

504
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:20,638
Brogan.

505
00:42:30,664 --> 00:42:31,692
Thank you, sir.

506
00:42:32,239 --> 00:42:34,199
- Thank you, Captain.
- No problem.

507
00:42:35,999 --> 00:42:39,039
Your place is burnt, give me
somewhere I can see him coming.

508
00:42:41,799 --> 00:42:43,708
I wanted to go in
there guns blazing.

509
00:42:43,856 --> 00:42:46,356
But she thought that diplomatic
approach made more sense.

510
00:42:46,887 --> 00:42:49,384
Yeah, gunfire might
have been kinder.

511
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:51,489
Great work in there.

512
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:52,889
What now?

513
00:42:52,989 --> 00:42:54,649
I need you to get
me to Budapest.

514
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,960
- What's in Budapest?
- What's in Budapest?

515
00:42:57,348 --> 00:42:59,419
Jack's informer - Yuri.

516
00:43:00,135 --> 00:43:04,215
These guys aren't trying to
kill me because I wanna retire.

517
00:43:04,302 --> 00:43:07,727
They're coming after me because they
think Jack told me something classified.

518
00:43:08,206 --> 00:43:09,741
Yuri ought to know about it.

519
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:13,460
I'm sorry, partner, but my Aztec
doesn't have that kind of voyage.

520
00:43:13,561 --> 00:43:16,226
Well, I was hoping we would
borrow something that does.

521
00:43:16,815 --> 00:43:17,815
Maybe a G?

522
00:43:20,272 --> 00:43:21,962
Taking someone's Gulfstream?

523
00:43:21,963 --> 00:43:24,630
I mean you.. you'd really have
to love the guy to do that.

524
00:43:27,129 --> 00:43:29,759
I know just the fellow.
Give me a minute.

525
00:43:32,206 --> 00:43:39,294
 Well, I got a woman, way over town 

526
00:43:39,295 --> 00:43:43,763
 That's good to me, oh yeah 

527
00:43:44,073 --> 00:43:48,678
 I got a woman, way over town 

528
00:43:49,336 --> 00:43:53,444
 Good to me, oh yeah 

529
00:43:53,889 --> 00:43:57,973
 She give me money when I'm in need 

530
00:44:03,691 --> 00:44:04,691
Henry?

531
00:44:06,681 --> 00:44:08,121
Did you ever have a kid?

532
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:10,255
No, why?

533
00:44:11,715 --> 00:44:13,094
Guy on a motorcycle.

534
00:44:14,398 --> 00:44:16,148
Did you notice anything
funny about him?

535
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:18,664
I noticed he was very good.

536
00:44:18,846 --> 00:44:19,846
Right.

537
00:44:20,840 --> 00:44:22,520
And the face?

538
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:24,980
Similarity?

539
00:44:27,483 --> 00:44:29,383
Yeah, I noticed that too.

540
00:44:29,705 --> 00:44:30,705
So...

541
00:44:31,285 --> 00:44:33,393
You never had a
long-term relationship?

542
00:44:33,457 --> 00:44:34,457
No.

543
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:35,952
Unless we count you.

544
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:41,443
Is it possible that you
could've had kid without knowing it?

545
00:44:41,444 --> 00:44:42,444
No.

546
00:44:44,207 --> 00:44:46,507
- Then how do you explain...
- Danny.

547
00:44:49,057 --> 00:44:50,287
Alright?

548
00:45:01,079 --> 00:45:03,006
Thank you, by the way.

549
00:45:04,072 --> 00:45:05,072
For?

550
00:45:05,376 --> 00:45:08,436
For leaving Baron's appartment,
so I wouldn't be a target.

551
00:45:09,762 --> 00:45:12,962
Coming and getting me in Georgia
when you could've just ran for you life.

552
00:45:13,449 --> 00:45:14,529
I just...

553
00:45:14,599 --> 00:45:19,449
wanted to put you on a private plane
and give you a free trip to Hungary.

554
00:45:20,199 --> 00:45:22,299
Where I am gonna find...?

555
00:45:22,469 --> 00:45:24,349
"Hungarians".

556
00:45:25,799 --> 00:45:26,979
Right.

557
00:45:31,029 --> 00:45:32,759
When I saw him.

558
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:37,029
It was like I was
seeing a ghost.

559
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:39,859
Ghost with a gun.

560
00:45:41,879 --> 00:45:42,929
Like...

561
00:45:43,199 --> 00:45:45,529
every trigger I've ever pulled.

562
00:46:17,279 --> 00:46:20,879
I told you to stay in Colombia
and wait for orders.

563
00:46:23,079 --> 00:46:25,279
I wanted to talk to you.

564
00:46:38,579 --> 00:46:40,629
He is very good.

565
00:46:41,229 --> 00:46:42,629
He's the best.

566
00:46:43,445 --> 00:46:44,912
That's why I sent you.

567
00:46:48,069 --> 00:46:52,369
He knew every move of
mine before I made it.

568
00:46:53,319 --> 00:46:56,881
I'd have him, right there,
and... take the shot

569
00:46:57,576 --> 00:47:00,227
and... he'd be gone.

570
00:47:01,759 --> 00:47:03,389
Like a ghost.

571
00:47:03,959 --> 00:47:06,219
Did you get a look at his face?

572
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:11,689
Not really, I saw him
at the stairs through a dirty mirror.

573
00:47:11,759 --> 00:47:13,839
I thought you were on the roof.

574
00:47:13,889 --> 00:47:16,141
I was, he got a line on
me, I had to jump down.

575
00:47:16,142 --> 00:47:17,742
What do we always drill?

576
00:47:18,642 --> 00:47:21,465
You hold the high ground, you
put his back against the wall

577
00:47:21,476 --> 00:47:23,009
and you don't let him go.

578
00:47:24,811 --> 00:47:26,271
I know that.

579
00:47:29,591 --> 00:47:31,517
Whole thing was weird.

580
00:47:31,657 --> 00:47:33,783
Just... wicky.

581
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:35,559
How?

582
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:38,739
I don't know, it was...
As if I were...

583
00:47:39,031 --> 00:47:40,831
watching it all.

584
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,060
Who is he?

585
00:47:44,027 --> 00:47:47,887
Junior, this thing, that you
are struggling with, this strangeness.

586
00:47:47,927 --> 00:47:49,387
It's fear.

587
00:47:50,127 --> 00:47:51,169
Don't hate it -

588
00:47:52,259 --> 00:47:53,549
lean into it.

589
00:47:54,098 --> 00:47:55,568
Embraced it.

590
00:47:55,569 --> 00:47:56,435
And then overcome it.

591
00:47:56,436 --> 00:48:00,405
You, are right in the threshold, son.

592
00:48:02,322 --> 00:48:03,822
This cause.

593
00:48:07,562 --> 00:48:08,992
You hungry?

594
00:48:11,562 --> 00:48:12,862
Yes, sir.

595
00:48:13,632 --> 00:48:15,862
Bowl of cereals hungry?

596
00:48:17,862 --> 00:48:19,212
Yes, sir.

597
00:49:22,532 --> 00:49:24,996
Thank you. That's it. Hands up.

598
00:49:28,420 --> 00:49:30,468
Over here, everyboy
take the line.

599
00:49:30,469 --> 00:49:31,834
Everybody back to one.

600
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,692
That's one, let's go!

601
00:49:44,586 --> 00:49:46,755
- Lots of new faces.
- Yeap.

602
00:49:47,786 --> 00:49:50,486
They'll be the first
boots on the ground in Yemen.

603
00:49:51,727 --> 00:49:54,903
Do they understand the rules of
engagement, or, just...

604
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:56,964
whatever moves - they shoot it?

605
00:49:57,612 --> 00:50:00,612
They are elite,
they're disciplined.

606
00:50:00,962 --> 00:50:04,059
And if they get a clean shot at their
target through an appartment window

607
00:50:04,060 --> 00:50:05,094
they'll take it.

608
00:50:07,048 --> 00:50:10,298
You should think about
that on your way to Budapest.

609
00:50:11,998 --> 00:50:13,948
Henry's just landed there.

610
00:50:15,648 --> 00:50:17,068
You're moving out.

611
00:50:36,268 --> 00:50:37,428
Aniko?

612
00:50:39,977 --> 00:50:41,174
Thank you for your time.

613
00:50:42,856 --> 00:50:44,229
Here are the samples.

614
00:50:50,216 --> 00:50:51,697
Least I can do for you in...

615
00:50:52,136 --> 00:50:53,136
2 days.

616
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,050
This I need in 2 hours.

617
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,680
We have a meeting with Yuri.

618
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,880
He agreed to sit with us.

619
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:09,180
You alright?

620
00:51:10,720 --> 00:51:13,180
I think I know why is
he as good as you, Henry.

621
00:51:15,302 --> 00:51:16,852
He is you.

622
00:51:18,522 --> 00:51:19,582
What?

623
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:23,502
There's a DNA lab here,
I gave them samples.

624
00:51:24,702 --> 00:51:27,152
Yours and the baseball
cap he was wearing.

625
00:51:28,252 --> 00:51:31,452
He just, he looks so much like you.
I thought he had to be your son, so I...

626
00:51:33,722 --> 00:51:35,402
They did 3 tests.

627
00:51:35,522 --> 00:51:37,202
Your DNA and his.

628
00:51:38,122 --> 00:51:39,982
All 3 came back identical.

629
00:51:40,752 --> 00:51:42,852
Not close, identical.

630
00:51:43,811 --> 00:51:45,671
As in, same person.

631
00:51:48,511 --> 00:51:50,041
He's your clone.

632
00:51:52,801 --> 00:51:55,440
I thought I've made a mistake that I
gave them two samples of the same person.

633
00:51:55,464 --> 00:51:56,464
But I didn't.

634
00:51:58,382 --> 00:51:59,882
He is you.

635
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:01,713
How's that even possible?

636
00:52:01,714 --> 00:52:03,981
It's complicated,
but it's doable.

637
00:52:04,163 --> 00:52:06,679
All you'd really need is a
surrogate mother and a DNA sample.

638
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,620
If they could clone a person.

639
00:52:08,812 --> 00:52:10,819
You'd think that
they'd clone more

640
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:12,810
doctors or scientists, not...

641
00:52:13,141 --> 00:52:14,141
me.

642
00:52:14,477 --> 00:52:16,207
They could've cloned
Nelson Mandela.

643
00:52:16,264 --> 00:52:20,114
Nelson Mandela couldn't kill a man
on a moving train from 2 kilometers away.

644
00:52:39,606 --> 00:52:40,606
Yuri?

645
00:52:44,113 --> 00:52:45,473
Mr. Brogan?

646
00:52:56,615 --> 00:52:58,505
Before we begin, I must confess.

647
00:52:58,506 --> 00:53:01,106
I have admired your
work for many years.

648
00:53:02,115 --> 00:53:05,726
Wait. So you know who I am?

649
00:53:07,022 --> 00:53:08,785
"Long time listener,
first time caller", -

650
00:53:08,786 --> 00:53:10,786
as they say in your country.

651
00:53:12,442 --> 00:53:14,144
I would congratulate you

652
00:53:14,835 --> 00:53:16,568
on your retirement, but...

653
00:53:16,915 --> 00:53:18,485
your last job has...

654
00:53:18,746 --> 00:53:19,813
loose ends, yes?

655
00:53:20,057 --> 00:53:22,782
Yeah, well... My government lied to me
and then tried to kill me.

656
00:53:22,783 --> 00:53:23,783
If that's what you mean.

657
00:53:24,083 --> 00:53:25,074
Yes.

658
00:53:25,075 --> 00:53:27,701
In Russia, you call
that "Tuesday".

659
00:53:28,157 --> 00:53:31,489
But Americans, it
hurts you feelings.

660
00:53:32,844 --> 00:53:33,674
So.

661
00:53:33,675 --> 00:53:36,243
So, why was Dormov trying
to go back to Russia?

662
00:53:36,287 --> 00:53:37,709
And why was I sent to kill him?

663
00:53:37,710 --> 00:53:39,108
Yeah, down to business.

664
00:53:39,109 --> 00:53:40,442
Very American.

665
00:53:41,338 --> 00:53:43,085
You are a busy man.

666
00:53:44,571 --> 00:53:47,031
We were both friends with Jack.

667
00:53:47,451 --> 00:53:49,201
He was a good man.

668
00:53:49,571 --> 00:53:52,131
I mourn his death, like you.

669
00:53:52,589 --> 00:53:54,576
But the reason you are here

670
00:53:54,577 --> 00:53:56,310
and I have not killed you

671
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:57,820
yet.

672
00:53:58,491 --> 00:54:01,141
Is we share a common enemy.

673
00:54:01,541 --> 00:54:02,971
Clay Verris.

674
00:54:04,511 --> 00:54:07,771
He lured Dormov to the west,
funded his lab.

675
00:54:08,811 --> 00:54:11,141
And now you have met the
fruits of their labor.

676
00:54:11,691 --> 00:54:14,175
Dally the Sheep
was cloned in '96.

677
00:54:14,176 --> 00:54:16,230
- But in '95...
- I was the sheep.

678
00:54:16,231 --> 00:54:17,978
Take it as a compliment.

679
00:54:18,825 --> 00:54:20,627
And you're the only one.

680
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:24,367
With your DNA Verris raised
the boy as his his son.

681
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:28,009
Trained him to be
the perfect assassin.

682
00:54:29,229 --> 00:54:31,309
So why was Dormov
trying to leave?

683
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:33,436
For years, we tried
to lure him back.

684
00:54:33,721 --> 00:54:34,721
Nothing.

685
00:54:34,835 --> 00:54:36,715
Then last year they
had a fallen out.

686
00:54:36,935 --> 00:54:39,262
Dormov got scared,
reached out to me.

687
00:54:39,268 --> 00:54:40,268
So I...

688
00:54:40,302 --> 00:54:43,432
That still doesn't explain
why I was sent to kill him.

689
00:54:44,352 --> 00:54:47,602
We have indications Dormov
made a breakthrough.

690
00:54:47,852 --> 00:54:49,502
Modified human DNA.

691
00:54:50,172 --> 00:54:52,202
A path to mass produciton.

692
00:54:52,503 --> 00:54:56,033
But Dormov wanted soldiers
to be stroger, smarter.

693
00:54:56,073 --> 00:54:57,623
Verris...

694
00:54:58,356 --> 00:55:00,686
Verris wanted something else.

695
00:55:02,276 --> 00:55:03,627
What something else?

696
00:55:04,127 --> 00:55:05,127
Mr. Brogan.

697
00:55:05,972 --> 00:55:08,521
You are the best at what you do.

698
00:55:08,824 --> 00:55:10,591
But still you get tired,

699
00:55:10,809 --> 00:55:12,394
you have fears, doubts,

700
00:55:12,395 --> 00:55:14,691
you feel pain, perhaps remorse.

701
00:55:16,139 --> 00:55:17,686
You have a conscience.

702
00:55:18,541 --> 00:55:20,008
These makes you human.

703
00:55:20,603 --> 00:55:22,955
But sub-optimital as a soldier.

704
00:55:23,142 --> 00:55:25,172
Less than perfect.

705
00:55:25,242 --> 00:55:26,942
Less profitable.

706
00:55:29,892 --> 00:55:33,392
Clayton Verris is
playing God with DNA.

707
00:55:34,328 --> 00:55:36,178
He must be stopped.

708
00:55:37,781 --> 00:55:40,386
If he's that dangerous
why don't you send a missile?

709
00:55:40,387 --> 00:55:41,947
Blow up his lab.

710
00:55:42,887 --> 00:55:44,747
That is what we're doing.

711
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:47,361
Except... you

712
00:55:47,746 --> 00:55:49,506
are the missile.

713
00:55:50,326 --> 00:55:52,076
I wish you luck.

714
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,723
One last thing.

715
00:55:55,942 --> 00:55:58,275
You excaped from
home two days ago?

716
00:55:58,862 --> 00:55:59,874
Shit.

717
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:00,875
Amazing work.

718
00:56:01,515 --> 00:56:03,675
I was on the edge of my seat.

719
00:56:04,677 --> 00:56:05,868
Wait, what?

720
00:56:06,652 --> 00:56:08,519
How the hell you
know about that?

721
00:56:10,157 --> 00:56:13,217
I'm a big fan, what can I say?

722
00:56:17,938 --> 00:56:20,211
If even half of what
he's saying is true.

723
00:56:20,212 --> 00:56:21,790
We got to talk to this kid.

724
00:56:21,939 --> 00:56:24,188
You're not gonna be
safe until you do.

725
00:56:24,189 --> 00:56:26,942
So you think if your 50-year
old self showed up and told you

726
00:56:26,943 --> 00:56:28,892
you're her clone that
would make you calmer?

727
00:56:28,893 --> 00:56:29,893
51.

728
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,299
- What?
- Just saying, you're...

729
00:56:33,567 --> 00:56:35,947
- You know you're 51, yeah?
- I rounded.

730
00:56:37,182 --> 00:56:39,762
He's the mirror you don't
want to look into, Henry.

731
00:56:40,462 --> 00:56:42,942
But he's our best
shot in getting to Verris.

732
00:56:51,582 --> 00:56:52,962
Janet Lassiter?

733
00:56:53,699 --> 00:56:55,249
Who wants to know?

734
00:56:55,516 --> 00:56:56,756
I got a message for you, ma'am.

735
00:56:57,175 --> 00:56:59,580
From a man who transferred a $1000
into my Featherqueen account

736
00:56:59,581 --> 00:57:01,120
just to make sure you got it.

737
00:57:01,565 --> 00:57:02,988
Does this person have a name?

738
00:57:03,897 --> 00:57:06,277
His name is "$1000 into
my Featherquin account".

739
00:57:08,861 --> 00:57:09,675
Hello, Janet.

740
00:57:09,827 --> 00:57:12,281
Before you try to kill
me again, consider this.

741
00:57:12,561 --> 00:57:15,491
Your home address
is 1362, Carol Grove.

742
00:57:15,790 --> 00:57:18,669
The security alarm code is 1776.

743
00:57:18,857 --> 00:57:21,017
You awaken at 6:12
every morning.

744
00:57:21,063 --> 00:57:24,552
And stop for your decaf soy latte
with an extra shot by 6:42.

745
00:57:25,097 --> 00:57:27,462
Every night you stand in front
of your huge living room window,

746
00:57:27,463 --> 00:57:29,596
sipping a Jose Cuervo Margarita

747
00:57:29,912 --> 00:57:31,974
with Forensic Files on the TV.

748
00:57:32,473 --> 00:57:35,552
Wearing your nice,
comfy sweatpants.

749
00:57:39,944 --> 00:57:41,065
This is Lassiter.

750
00:57:41,066 --> 00:57:43,543
There are shooters at
your 10 and 2.

751
00:57:43,544 --> 00:57:46,478
Get above of that chair,
you will be AMF'ed.

752
00:57:47,378 --> 00:57:49,336
Now, if I thought the world
needed another me

753
00:57:49,337 --> 00:57:50,782
I would've had a kid.

754
00:57:51,563 --> 00:57:53,732
The program predates
my arrival at the agency,

755
00:57:53,733 --> 00:57:54,782
You must know that.

756
00:57:54,783 --> 00:57:56,263
Yeah, perfect DC answer.

757
00:57:56,303 --> 00:57:58,533
If something goes wrong - duck.

758
00:57:59,303 --> 00:58:01,322
Tip the bike guy.

759
00:58:02,035 --> 00:58:03,035
You can go.

760
00:58:04,321 --> 00:58:07,671
Now, I have your agent
with me against her will.

761
00:58:07,821 --> 00:58:09,711
Danielle Zakarweski.

762
00:58:09,936 --> 00:58:11,336
She wants to come in.

763
00:58:12,073 --> 00:58:13,073
Fine.

764
00:58:13,175 --> 00:58:15,631
Now, like me, she is a patriot.

765
00:58:15,816 --> 00:58:16,915
Unlike me,

766
00:58:17,366 --> 00:58:19,497
she still wants to spend
the next couple decades

767
00:58:19,640 --> 00:58:21,687
scoring touchdowns
for you assholes.

768
00:58:22,630 --> 00:58:24,837
Her safety is non-negotiable.

769
00:58:25,378 --> 00:58:26,987
10 and 2, Janet.

770
00:58:26,988 --> 00:58:29,018
Decaf soy latte,
an extra shot for Janet?

771
00:58:29,068 --> 00:58:31,162
The only person I'll
turn her over to

772
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:33,705
is the guy you sent
after me in Cartagena.

773
00:58:33,916 --> 00:58:36,166
Don't even think about
sending anybody else.

774
00:58:36,236 --> 00:58:38,816
Family reunion, very sweet.

775
00:58:39,158 --> 00:58:39,690
Yeah.

776
00:58:39,846 --> 00:58:42,891
Keep it up, you'll be the first
person I've ever killed for free.

777
00:58:43,495 --> 00:58:45,545
How quickly can you
get him to Budapest?

778
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,525
5 minutes.

779
00:58:51,345 --> 00:58:52,445
Good.

780
00:58:52,895 --> 00:58:56,745
She'll be in the courtyard of the
Vajdahunyad Castle at midnight, tonight.

781
00:58:56,995 --> 00:58:58,645
Enjoy your latte.

782
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:00,816
What's AMF?

783
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:02,474
Adios mother fucker.

784
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:05,516
How the hell does
he know we're here?

785
00:59:17,676 --> 00:59:19,580
This is gonna work, right?

786
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:21,160
Yes.

787
00:59:21,963 --> 00:59:22,983
How do you know?

788
00:59:23,945 --> 00:59:26,125
I know his taste.

789
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:29,325
Wait, are you saying
you are attracted to me?

790
00:59:30,225 --> 00:59:31,225
Me?

791
00:59:31,645 --> 00:59:33,405
Now? Hell no.

792
00:59:33,492 --> 00:59:37,122
But the younger, less
mature version, maybe.

793
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:46,830
When I came for you in Georgia,

794
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:51,220
I didn't have to think
about that, it was instinct.

795
00:59:52,140 --> 00:59:54,220
He was born with that too.

796
00:59:54,812 --> 00:59:57,372
Besides, he wants me.

797
01:01:06,442 --> 01:01:07,792
Right.

798
01:01:15,012 --> 01:01:16,542
Lovely courtyard.

799
01:01:18,012 --> 01:01:19,437
I'm sorry, ma'am.

800
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:22,559
Before we go any further,
I'm gonna need you to strip.

801
01:01:23,956 --> 01:01:25,456
I beg you pardon?

802
01:01:26,276 --> 01:01:28,706
Need to be certain
you're not wearing a wire.

803
01:01:31,456 --> 01:01:32,956
Okay, first of all.

804
01:01:33,254 --> 01:01:34,734
Ma'am?

805
01:01:35,254 --> 01:01:37,854
I was raised to respect my elders.

806
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,904
Take off your clothes, please.

807
01:02:10,094 --> 01:02:11,824
Turn around, please.

808
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,765
I see you like to be thorough?

809
01:02:44,226 --> 01:02:46,286
Caution is kept me alive.

810
01:02:50,656 --> 01:02:52,106
Call this burner.

811
01:03:00,706 --> 01:03:01,786
Thank you.

812
01:03:03,306 --> 01:03:04,306
Brogan.

813
01:03:04,806 --> 01:03:08,006
In 12 minutes, I'm putting 2
bullets in the back of her head.

814
01:03:08,406 --> 01:03:10,606
Your orders are to
deliver her safely.

815
01:03:10,706 --> 01:03:12,656
My orders are to kill you.

816
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:16,309
Are you familiar with the
quartz chamber at the catacombs?

817
01:03:16,310 --> 01:03:17,067
Negative.

818
01:03:17,068 --> 01:03:19,785
We're doing it some place
visible, where I can see you.

819
01:03:20,222 --> 01:03:22,052
Now you have 11 minutes.

820
01:03:25,122 --> 01:03:27,182
Get dressed.
We're taking a ride.

821
01:03:40,085 --> 01:03:41,745
Cab was a smart move.

822
01:03:42,978 --> 01:03:43,978
Where are you from?

823
01:03:45,636 --> 01:03:47,233
Your formality, it's Southern.

824
01:03:52,936 --> 01:03:55,250
You know if you gonna use me
as bait and possible murder me

825
01:03:55,251 --> 01:03:57,727
then the least you can do
is indulge me in some conversation.

826
01:04:00,029 --> 01:04:01,762
Just outside Atlanta.

827
01:04:03,164 --> 01:04:05,024
You two have a lot in common.

828
01:04:05,663 --> 01:04:06,708
I doubt that.

829
01:04:07,057 --> 01:04:08,817
You'd be surprised.

830
01:04:10,557 --> 01:04:12,222
You know I started
following him too

831
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:13,449
just like you're doing.

832
01:04:14,410 --> 01:04:15,965
Then I got to know him.

833
01:04:17,126 --> 01:04:18,610
He's got a big heart, like you.

834
01:04:20,912 --> 01:04:23,142
What do you know about my heart?

835
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:26,379
I know that you have one.

836
01:04:27,499 --> 01:04:29,554
And I know that it's telling you
that something about the job

837
01:04:29,555 --> 01:04:31,327
you've been given isn't right.

838
01:04:31,805 --> 01:04:33,274
Job is the job, ma'am.

839
01:04:46,872 --> 01:04:48,868
I wonder how much you
payed the custodian.

840
01:04:50,798 --> 01:04:51,798
Wow.

841
01:04:52,431 --> 01:04:53,861
Left.

842
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:58,107
Undo the chain.

843
01:05:02,677 --> 01:05:03,677
Basement.

844
01:05:04,483 --> 01:05:06,056
You must really know the city.

845
01:05:06,234 --> 01:05:07,771
I watch a lot of Nat Geo.

846
01:05:07,931 --> 01:05:09,990
- It says "Off limits".
- Ma'am.

847
01:05:17,573 --> 01:05:19,555
I wonder how many
people are buried down here.

848
01:05:19,735 --> 01:05:21,043
Stand over there.

849
01:05:50,585 --> 01:05:51,735
Go.

850
01:05:53,785 --> 01:05:55,033
If you knock out all the lights,

851
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,503
how are you gonna see your
own tripwire on the way out?

852
01:05:57,996 --> 01:06:00,184
The granade is no joke,
I mean I get the idea.

853
01:06:00,347 --> 01:06:03,747
Darkness neutralizes his biggest strength,
enclosed court favors you, right?

854
01:06:03,921 --> 01:06:06,201
I mean he can't throw a
grenade without killing me too.

855
01:06:06,553 --> 01:06:08,391
But what if I tries gas?

856
01:06:08,526 --> 01:06:10,141
You know, or some
sort of sedative agent?

857
01:06:11,057 --> 01:06:11,782
Way ahead of me.

858
01:06:11,783 --> 01:06:13,759
Gas mask and night
vision, very smart.

859
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:15,278
- Over there.
- Zip ties!

860
01:06:15,279 --> 01:06:16,791
These must be for me?

861
01:06:17,512 --> 01:06:18,885
But can I ask you something?

862
01:06:18,886 --> 01:06:21,984
Would you actually stop talking
long enough for me to answer?

863
01:06:22,177 --> 01:06:23,804
How much do you know about him?

864
01:06:23,948 --> 01:06:25,438
I mean, would they tell you
why they wanted him dead?

865
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:26,439
Guy cracked.

866
01:06:26,683 --> 01:06:29,163
Killed 8 ops in a single
night and his spotter.

867
01:06:29,233 --> 01:06:31,076
- That's what they told you?
- That's what he did.

868
01:06:31,077 --> 01:06:32,077
No.

869
01:06:32,310 --> 01:06:33,113
No, not exactly.

870
01:06:33,114 --> 01:06:34,430
I was there.

871
01:06:34,574 --> 01:06:36,100
The night all those
operatives were hit.

872
01:06:36,124 --> 01:06:37,407
They'd been sent to kill him,

873
01:06:37,548 --> 01:06:39,238
and me, by Gemini.

874
01:06:39,239 --> 01:06:41,711
And not that it matters,
but his sparrow shot in Virginia

875
01:06:41,712 --> 01:06:44,104
and the rest of those
men went down in Savannah.

876
01:06:47,112 --> 01:06:50,442
Henry can shoot long distance,
but he can't shoot that long.

877
01:06:54,442 --> 01:06:57,672
Come on, just think.
Does that make any sense to you?

878
01:06:57,742 --> 01:07:00,412
So you understand what I'm saying?
It doesn't...

879
01:07:01,142 --> 01:07:02,142
Better.

880
01:07:02,482 --> 01:07:03,482
Fuck you.

881
01:08:05,618 --> 01:08:07,177
Get up. Go.

882
01:08:21,288 --> 01:08:22,715
Stay right there.

883
01:08:30,888 --> 01:08:32,379
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

884
01:08:32,918 --> 01:08:34,482
Do you know how to
light one of those?

885
01:08:34,483 --> 01:08:35,483
Jesus, Henry.

886
01:08:43,822 --> 01:08:45,685
Thanks for the tip
on the granade.

887
01:08:46,937 --> 01:08:48,763
You were talking to
him all the time?

888
01:08:48,764 --> 01:08:49,764
Yeah.

889
01:08:49,935 --> 01:08:51,535
You either search somebody.

890
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:52,694
Or you don't.

891
01:08:54,716 --> 01:08:55,863
And for the record.

892
01:08:56,644 --> 01:08:58,704
I do not want to kill you.

893
01:08:59,044 --> 01:09:01,674
But I absolutely will
if I have to.

894
01:09:02,944 --> 01:09:05,084
What did Clay Verris
tell you about me?

895
01:09:07,174 --> 01:09:09,524
Okay, let me tell you about him.

896
01:09:10,044 --> 01:09:12,674
Cause I know Mr. Verris well.

897
01:09:13,324 --> 01:09:14,861
How did he start you?

898
01:09:15,142 --> 01:09:16,775
Hunting birds, rabbit?

899
01:09:16,776 --> 01:09:19,399
About 12 years old,
he moved you up to deer.

900
01:09:19,692 --> 01:09:22,099
I'm guessing 19 or 20 years old,

901
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:24,902
the first time he ordered
you to shoot a person.

902
01:09:25,950 --> 01:09:27,730
Any of these ring a true?

903
01:09:28,881 --> 01:09:29,931
Yeah.

904
01:09:30,099 --> 01:09:32,759
He told you to
lean into your fear.

905
01:09:33,076 --> 01:09:34,926
Because you were a warrior.

906
01:09:34,927 --> 01:09:37,695
Blessed with great gifts
to defend the weak.

907
01:09:39,559 --> 01:09:41,959
But he couldn't stop the noise.

908
01:09:42,509 --> 01:09:46,959
That secret part of you that always felt
a little different than everybody else.

909
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:49,727
Part that felt like a weirdo.

910
01:09:50,547 --> 01:09:51,960
You don't know shit.

911
01:09:51,961 --> 01:09:54,361
Kid, I know your inside
out and backwards.

912
01:09:55,215 --> 01:09:57,899
You allergic to bees,
you hate cilantro.

913
01:09:57,900 --> 01:09:59,903
You always sneeze 4 times.

914
01:10:00,665 --> 01:10:02,795
Everybody hates cilantro.

915
01:10:04,433 --> 01:10:08,679
You're meticulous, thorough,
disciplined, relentless.

916
01:10:09,126 --> 01:10:10,259
You love puzzles.

917
01:10:11,812 --> 01:10:14,592
You are a chess player, right?

918
01:10:15,043 --> 01:10:16,460
Good too, I bet.

919
01:10:17,151 --> 01:10:20,684
But you suffer from insomnia,
your mind never lets you sleep.

920
01:10:21,925 --> 01:10:23,894
And even when it does, it
attacks you with nightmares.

921
01:10:23,895 --> 01:10:26,430
I am talking about those
3 o'clock in the morning -

922
01:10:26,431 --> 01:10:29,161
"somebody please save me"
kind of nightmares.

923
01:10:29,987 --> 01:10:31,453
And then there's the doubts.

924
01:10:31,454 --> 01:10:32,454
And those are the worst.

925
01:10:33,115 --> 01:10:35,784
You hate them, and you
hate yourself for having them.

926
01:10:35,785 --> 01:10:37,200
They make you feel weak.

927
01:10:37,527 --> 01:10:40,113
A real soldier doesn't doubt, right?

928
01:10:41,172 --> 01:10:44,970
The only time you
ever trully feel happy

929
01:10:45,209 --> 01:10:48,513
is when you're flat on your belly
about to squeeze the trigger.

930
01:10:49,300 --> 01:10:53,143
And at that moment,
the world makes perfect sense.

931
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:56,654
How do you think I
know all of that?

932
01:10:56,742 --> 01:10:58,592
I don't give a shit
how you know anything.

933
01:10:58,752 --> 01:11:00,952
Look at me, dummy!

934
01:11:01,402 --> 01:11:02,952
Look at us!

935
01:11:03,702 --> 01:11:08,032
25 years ago, your father took
my blood and he cloned me.

936
01:11:08,172 --> 01:11:11,159
He made you from me.

937
01:11:11,326 --> 01:11:13,358
Our DNA is identical.

938
01:11:13,865 --> 01:11:15,451
He's telling you the truth.

939
01:11:15,547 --> 01:11:16,547
Shut up!

940
01:11:16,749 --> 01:11:19,165
He chose me cause there's
never been anybody like me,

941
01:11:19,166 --> 01:11:22,373
and he knew one day I was
gonna get old and then you'd step in.

942
01:11:22,516 --> 01:11:24,783
He's been lying to
you the whole time.

943
01:11:24,921 --> 01:11:26,788
He told you you were an orphan.

944
01:11:27,395 --> 01:11:30,524
And of all the people in the world to
come after me why would he send you?

945
01:11:30,525 --> 01:11:32,078
Because I'm the best.

946
01:11:33,454 --> 01:11:35,603
You are, obviously,
not the best.

947
01:11:38,659 --> 01:11:40,233
You're a hard ass hit.

948
01:11:42,179 --> 01:11:45,229
Guess this was supposed to
be your birthday or something that.

949
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:48,223
I had to die, and
you had to do it.

950
01:11:48,446 --> 01:11:50,160
As long as I was alive somehow,

951
01:11:50,347 --> 01:11:52,999
Clay's little experiment
was incomplete.

952
01:11:53,163 --> 01:11:55,654
That's the maniac you're
pulling the trigger for.

953
01:11:55,758 --> 01:11:57,795
Shut your mouth about him!

954
01:11:57,955 --> 01:11:59,048
You just trying to rattle me.

955
01:11:59,072 --> 01:12:00,605
I'm trying to save you!

956
01:12:02,694 --> 01:12:05,163
What are you, 23?

957
01:12:05,744 --> 01:12:07,483
Still a virgin, right?

958
01:12:08,161 --> 01:12:09,161
Yeah.

959
01:12:09,741 --> 01:12:11,753
Dying to be in a
relationship and connect,

960
01:12:11,754 --> 01:12:14,287
but terrified to
let anybody near you.

961
01:12:16,056 --> 01:12:20,408
Because what if somebody
actually saw who you are?

962
01:12:20,915 --> 01:12:22,681
How could they love you?

963
01:12:23,574 --> 01:12:25,591
So, everybody is just targets.

964
01:12:26,227 --> 01:12:28,057
And you're just a weapon.

965
01:12:31,007 --> 01:12:32,007
Hey! Hey!

966
01:12:59,320 --> 01:13:00,450
Hey!

967
01:13:18,620 --> 01:13:19,890
Don't shoot him!

968
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:38,865
Don't shoot him!

969
01:14:32,145 --> 01:14:33,318
No! Don't!

970
01:14:33,556 --> 01:14:34,556
Drop it!

971
01:14:35,147 --> 01:14:36,668
Drop it! I will shoot you!

972
01:14:37,949 --> 01:14:39,128
No, you won't.

973
01:15:18,468 --> 01:15:20,368
Take your hands off of him!

974
01:15:21,222 --> 01:15:22,222
Let him go!

975
01:15:24,990 --> 01:15:25,990
Right now!

976
01:15:34,351 --> 01:15:35,951
I'm not you!

977
01:15:36,971 --> 01:15:38,301
You hear me, old man?

978
01:15:39,801 --> 01:15:41,501
I'm not you!

979
01:15:44,058 --> 01:15:46,477
- Where is he?
- He's gone.

980
01:15:46,807 --> 01:15:48,960
- Did you hit him?
- I think so, yeah.

981
01:15:49,460 --> 01:15:51,709
- Where?
- Shoulder, I think.

982
01:15:54,326 --> 01:15:56,106
Then he'll recover.

983
01:15:57,245 --> 01:15:58,775
Is that a good thing?

984
01:16:17,698 --> 01:16:18,006
You know,

985
01:16:18,007 --> 01:16:22,218
It's not every day you see a guy
get his ass kicked on 2 continents.

986
01:16:22,234 --> 01:16:23,462
By himself.

987
01:16:31,041 --> 01:16:32,083
Where to?

988
01:16:33,185 --> 01:16:34,185
Georgia.

989
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:36,951
Is where Verris is.

990
01:16:51,091 --> 01:16:52,091
Man.

991
01:16:53,934 --> 01:16:55,584
That poor kid.

992
01:16:56,449 --> 01:16:58,219
He must be terrified.

993
01:16:59,254 --> 01:17:02,634
Then he's going home,
walking into a buzz saw.

994
01:17:07,874 --> 01:17:11,104
I gonna get some sleep, you too.

995
01:17:12,654 --> 01:17:15,354
Not me, that's where
the ghosts are.

996
01:17:16,254 --> 01:17:17,634
Sleep.

997
01:17:43,054 --> 01:17:44,454
Tell me something.

998
01:17:45,574 --> 01:17:48,634
Why is it so hard
for you to kill this man?

999
01:17:51,104 --> 01:17:55,204
You know how much I hate
Big Hammock Park, pop?

1000
01:17:56,554 --> 01:17:57,734
What?

1001
01:17:58,754 --> 01:18:02,034
Ever since I was
about 12 years old.

1002
01:18:02,554 --> 01:18:06,854
We were to shoot turkeys
there for my birthday.

1003
01:18:08,504 --> 01:18:10,454
And I always hated it.

1004
01:18:11,804 --> 01:18:12,987
But I was an orphan, right?

1005
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:14,199
So, how would we

1006
01:18:14,734 --> 01:18:16,801
even know when my Birthday was?

1007
01:18:18,540 --> 01:18:22,363
But you never seen me
notice so we just keep going.

1008
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:23,460
Okay, so...

1009
01:18:23,461 --> 01:18:25,490
Next year we'll
try Chuck E. Cheese.

1010
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:28,285
Yeah.

1011
01:18:28,918 --> 01:18:33,809
You, me and the lab
guys, who made me.

1012
01:18:40,808 --> 01:18:41,838
Yeah.

1013
01:18:45,618 --> 01:18:47,268
I...

1014
01:18:49,333 --> 01:18:51,363
Always believed

1015
01:18:52,735 --> 01:18:55,715
you'd be happier not knowing.

1016
01:18:58,135 --> 01:18:59,595
Happy?

1017
01:19:01,135 --> 01:19:03,165
You know when I'm happy, pop?

1018
01:19:04,415 --> 01:19:06,515
When I'm flat on my belly,

1019
01:19:06,935 --> 01:19:09,165
about to squeeze the trigger.

1020
01:19:11,065 --> 01:19:13,065
It's the only time I'm happy.

1021
01:19:14,615 --> 01:19:17,405
And this wasn't even a mistake.

1022
01:19:18,845 --> 01:19:21,288
It's not like you got
someone pregnant

1023
01:19:21,289 --> 01:19:24,506
and then had to man
up and raise me.

1024
01:19:24,663 --> 01:19:26,041
No, you...

1025
01:19:26,474 --> 01:19:27,541
made a decision.

1026
01:19:28,635 --> 01:19:31,493
To have a scientist
make a person

1027
01:19:31,494 --> 01:19:32,876
out of another person.

1028
01:19:32,877 --> 01:19:34,227
No, that's not what it was.

1029
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:35,945
That's exactly what it was.

1030
01:19:37,333 --> 01:19:38,994
Then you sent me

1031
01:19:40,553 --> 01:19:41,502
to kill him.

1032
01:19:41,503 --> 01:19:45,006
Of all the shooters in
the world, why would you send me?

1033
01:19:45,007 --> 01:19:48,857
It's your darkness, you had
to walk through this on your own.

1034
01:19:50,557 --> 01:19:52,537
Maybe you're my darkness.

1035
01:19:54,457 --> 01:19:57,437
That lie you told me.

1036
01:19:58,617 --> 01:20:00,937
That my parents

1037
01:20:01,887 --> 01:20:05,277
dumped me at a fire station.

1038
01:20:06,977 --> 01:20:08,687
And I believed that.

1039
01:20:10,147 --> 01:20:12,197
Do you know how
that made me feel?

1040
01:20:12,267 --> 01:20:14,492
It was a necessary lie.

1041
01:20:14,493 --> 01:20:16,948
None of this shit is necessary!

1042
01:20:17,950 --> 01:20:20,094
You made a choice
to do this to me.

1043
01:20:20,095 --> 01:20:24,345
- Can't you see how not okay I am?
- Bullshit!

1044
01:20:24,865 --> 01:20:27,195
You forget who you
are talking to, Junior.

1045
01:20:27,265 --> 01:20:28,550
I've seen battle.

1046
01:20:29,103 --> 01:20:30,783
I've seen soldiers
go over the edge because

1047
01:20:30,905 --> 01:20:32,780
more of was being asked of
them than they can give.

1048
01:20:32,781 --> 01:20:34,227
That's not you.

1049
01:20:34,525 --> 01:20:36,942
Your world is stable
and dependable.

1050
01:20:36,943 --> 01:20:38,173
I made sure of that.

1051
01:20:38,475 --> 01:20:41,078
You have something that
Henry himself never had.

1052
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:45,195
You have a loving,
dedicated, present father.

1053
01:20:45,267 --> 01:20:48,915
Who tells you every, goddamnit, day that
you are precious and that you matter.

1054
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:50,869
Jesus, the whole
point of this thing.

1055
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:54,812
Was to give you all of Henry's
gifts without his pain, and I did.

1056
01:20:56,075 --> 01:20:59,388
Don't doubt, Junior.

1057
01:21:01,688 --> 01:21:03,638
You're better than that.

1058
01:21:14,018 --> 01:21:15,388
Come here.

1059
01:21:20,421 --> 01:21:22,631
I love you, son.

1060
01:21:25,481 --> 01:21:28,531
Just don't let yourself down.

1061
01:21:57,081 --> 01:22:00,871
Like so many of my encounters,
it was short, but sweet.

1062
01:22:00,961 --> 01:22:02,741
Thanks, baby.

1063
01:22:15,741 --> 01:22:17,991
It should be truck
here somewhere.

1064
01:22:26,821 --> 01:22:28,261
Don't move.

1065
01:22:33,521 --> 01:22:34,596
What was in that?

1066
01:22:35,269 --> 01:22:36,269
Bee venom.

1067
01:22:41,449 --> 01:22:42,938
You can't do that.

1068
01:22:43,538 --> 01:22:45,126
You can't do that,
he's allergic.

1069
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,275
Henry, can you breathe?

1070
01:22:47,708 --> 01:22:48,895
Henry, try to breathe.

1071
01:22:49,780 --> 01:22:51,101
- You okay?
- Please.

1072
01:22:51,265 --> 01:22:53,518
Henry, Henry, can you breathe?

1073
01:22:53,684 --> 01:22:54,684
Please!

1074
01:22:54,930 --> 01:22:56,844
Try to breathe, Henry. Henry!

1075
01:22:58,174 --> 01:22:59,444
Breathe!

1076
01:22:59,813 --> 01:23:01,616
- Why are you doing this?
- Come on!

1077
01:23:04,282 --> 01:23:06,922
- Why are you doing this?
- Henry, Henry, breathe!

1078
01:23:07,120 --> 01:23:08,120
Come on!

1079
01:23:08,595 --> 01:23:09,595
Hey, hey.

1080
01:23:10,190 --> 01:23:11,190
Breathe, Henry.

1081
01:23:22,435 --> 01:23:24,320
Epinephrine antihistamine.

1082
01:23:27,538 --> 01:23:28,798
You'll be fine.

1083
01:23:32,854 --> 01:23:33,854
I'm sorry.

1084
01:23:34,996 --> 01:23:36,387
I had to be sure.

1085
01:23:36,866 --> 01:23:38,716
No, it's all good.

1086
01:23:39,049 --> 01:23:41,356
It's whole shit's
been a little difficult.

1087
01:23:41,541 --> 01:23:43,398
I hate to break up
the party, but

1088
01:23:43,610 --> 01:23:46,161
how the hell do you always
know where we are?

1089
01:23:48,267 --> 01:23:49,937
They're tracking you.

1090
01:23:52,937 --> 01:23:54,607
Do you trust me?

1091
01:24:17,817 --> 01:24:21,614
They chipped you.
During your surgery 3 years ago.

1092
01:24:26,448 --> 01:24:27,498
Verris.

1093
01:24:29,485 --> 01:24:31,035
You know him too?

1094
01:24:31,252 --> 01:24:33,962
Panama, Kuwait, Somalia.

1095
01:24:34,382 --> 01:24:36,162
Can you take us to him?

1096
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:39,911
We need to shot him down.

1097
01:24:40,584 --> 01:24:41,584
Both of us.

1098
01:24:53,487 --> 01:24:55,308
You grew up in
Philadelphia, right?

1099
01:24:55,675 --> 01:24:56,347
Yeah.

1100
01:24:56,524 --> 01:24:58,306
The place called the Bottom.

1101
01:24:59,177 --> 01:25:00,647
The Bottom.

1102
01:25:02,207 --> 01:25:04,057
Tell me about my mother.

1103
01:25:06,947 --> 01:25:08,643
Helen Jackson Brogan.

1104
01:25:08,825 --> 01:25:10,892
Worked two jobs for 40 years.

1105
01:25:11,733 --> 01:25:14,031
That woman used to whip my ass.

1106
01:25:14,773 --> 01:25:16,190
Did you deserve it?

1107
01:25:16,512 --> 01:25:17,512
Usually.

1108
01:25:17,868 --> 01:25:20,081
Does being angry and stupid

1109
01:25:20,232 --> 01:25:22,699
and never really trying at
anything mean you deserve it?

1110
01:25:24,729 --> 01:25:27,974
Our father wasn't around much,
he left when I was 5.

1111
01:25:28,161 --> 01:25:31,664
And I think every time she
looked at me, she just saw him.

1112
01:25:33,093 --> 01:25:34,844
I had to get the
hell outta there.

1113
01:25:35,298 --> 01:25:36,820
Joined the Core.

1114
01:25:37,527 --> 01:25:39,867
First time I've ever made
any real friends.

1115
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:41,208
'Oorah!'

1116
01:25:43,216 --> 01:25:44,774
Met Clay Verris there.

1117
01:25:45,629 --> 01:25:49,209
Found something I was
really, really good at.

1118
01:25:50,159 --> 01:25:52,494
By the time I left, I had
medals on the chest.

1119
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:55,267
She was gone, and...

1120
01:25:55,625 --> 01:25:57,092
I have become this.

1121
01:25:59,495 --> 01:26:02,698
You got to walk away
while you still can.

1122
01:26:04,030 --> 01:26:07,133
- This is all I know.
- No, this is all he taught you.

1123
01:26:07,356 --> 01:26:11,138
Stop now, you can still
become something else.

1124
01:26:13,175 --> 01:26:14,185
Sure.

1125
01:26:14,545 --> 01:26:17,214
A Doctor? Lawyer?

1126
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:20,280
Husband, father.

1127
01:26:20,340 --> 01:26:23,773
And all the things this job
gives you the excuse not to be.

1128
01:26:25,651 --> 01:26:27,046
I threw all of that away.

1129
01:26:29,230 --> 01:26:32,410
It's shame to waste these
gifts the second time around.

1130
01:26:36,970 --> 01:26:38,950
I'm sorry, what is your name?

1131
01:26:40,799 --> 01:26:42,439
It's always been Junior.

1132
01:26:43,129 --> 01:26:44,449
Clay Junior.

1133
01:26:46,099 --> 01:26:47,949
I don't really know anymore.

1134
01:26:49,069 --> 01:26:51,519
That's another really
good reason to quit.

1135
01:26:57,539 --> 01:26:59,229
Do you sure about this?

1136
01:27:00,214 --> 01:27:01,816
I need to talk to him.

1137
01:27:03,414 --> 01:27:06,587
So, what happens
when we get to him?

1138
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:08,620
He's not gonna surrender.

1139
01:27:16,950 --> 01:27:17,950
That's him.

1140
01:27:18,205 --> 01:27:19,249
Can I talk to him?

1141
01:27:19,382 --> 01:27:22,395
I want to be the one to
tell him we all BFFs now.

1142
01:27:23,557 --> 01:27:24,937
Take it.

1143
01:27:26,362 --> 01:27:27,542
This is Junior.

1144
01:27:27,543 --> 01:27:28,876
Are you with Brogan?

1145
01:27:29,426 --> 01:27:31,779
Why would I be with him?
You sent me to kill him, didn't you?

1146
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:33,596
It doesn't matter, just run.

1147
01:27:35,572 --> 01:27:36,460
What?

1148
01:27:36,461 --> 01:27:38,500
Run, get away from him. Now.

1149
01:27:38,975 --> 01:27:41,207
Junior, I just want you safe.

1150
01:27:41,279 --> 01:27:42,279
Why?

1151
01:27:42,505 --> 01:27:44,527
Because I'm your
favorite experiment?

1152
01:27:44,528 --> 01:27:47,916
No, because I'm your father
and you need to listen to me.

1153
01:27:47,917 --> 01:27:48,927
Run!

1154
01:27:51,687 --> 01:27:53,097
- Get out off the car!
- Go!

1155
01:27:58,997 --> 01:28:00,337
Baron!

1156
01:28:00,897 --> 01:28:01,897
No!

1157
01:28:14,577 --> 01:28:15,887
Come on!

1158
01:28:24,327 --> 01:28:25,887
I'm sorry, Henry.

1159
01:28:33,427 --> 01:28:35,247
- Chief Mitchell?
- Go ahead.

1160
01:28:35,327 --> 01:28:38,047
Clay Verris, I need your
units to stand down.

1161
01:28:38,742 --> 01:28:39,205
Sir?

1162
01:28:39,362 --> 01:28:43,881
We're engaging with a terrorist cell that
has a weaponized biological capability.

1163
01:28:43,882 --> 01:28:46,455
All units, go back, immediately!

1164
01:28:47,952 --> 01:28:51,192
Federal authorities have been
notified and they en route.

1165
01:28:51,292 --> 01:28:53,447
Affirmative, keep me
posting, Clay.

1166
01:28:53,608 --> 01:28:54,608
Yes, sir.

1167
01:28:57,035 --> 01:28:59,197
You got to stand your
men down, now!

1168
01:28:59,389 --> 01:29:00,864
You did the right thing, Junior

1169
01:29:00,865 --> 01:29:01,865
of walking away from him.

1170
01:29:02,256 --> 01:29:03,639
I did what a coward would do.

1171
01:29:04,191 --> 01:29:05,191
Makes me sick!

1172
01:29:06,033 --> 01:29:07,967
I was asking too much of you.

1173
01:29:08,480 --> 01:29:09,480
I can see that now.

1174
01:29:10,245 --> 01:29:13,546
He deserves better than a
missile shot into his car, pop.

1175
01:29:13,547 --> 01:29:16,812
It doesn't matter what he
deserves, he has to die.

1176
01:29:56,109 --> 01:29:57,826
Are you gonna call
those goons off now?

1177
01:29:57,858 --> 01:29:59,581
No. But you can.

1178
01:30:00,484 --> 01:30:02,791
Just fire that. Take command.

1179
01:30:04,097 --> 01:30:06,767
Armor's weak at the joints.
Eyes and neck are the kill shots.

1180
01:30:07,439 --> 01:30:09,004
Take right, I'll take left.

1181
01:30:15,491 --> 01:30:16,630
Muscle, discipline.

1182
01:30:16,915 --> 01:30:18,099
Watch you round count.

1183
01:30:18,297 --> 01:30:19,564
You set, I spike.

1184
01:30:19,826 --> 01:30:21,378
- Ready?
- Roger that.

1185
01:30:38,701 --> 01:30:39,718
- I'm out!
- Take cover!

1186
01:30:48,317 --> 01:30:49,317
Set!

1187
01:31:01,274 --> 01:31:02,274
Get down!

1188
01:31:20,787 --> 01:31:24,445
I am trying to make you a man!

1189
01:31:26,923 --> 01:31:28,975
I should have cloned myself.

1190
01:31:36,305 --> 01:31:39,894
Loving, dedicated,
present father?

1191
01:31:42,098 --> 01:31:43,098
Right there!

1192
01:31:48,812 --> 01:31:50,192
Go ahead.

1193
01:31:51,242 --> 01:31:52,592
Do it.

1194
01:32:03,393 --> 01:32:04,725
How many rounds you got left?

1195
01:32:08,335 --> 01:32:09,335
One.

1196
01:32:09,895 --> 01:32:11,245
Okay.

1197
01:32:20,175 --> 01:32:21,485
I'm sorry.

1198
01:32:21,605 --> 01:32:22,702
For what?

1199
01:32:23,391 --> 01:32:24,672
For getting you into this.

1200
01:32:25,024 --> 01:32:26,387
I was the one surveilling you.

1201
01:32:26,534 --> 01:32:27,534
Yeah.

1202
01:32:28,466 --> 01:32:31,086
Anyway, sorry.

1203
01:32:32,115 --> 01:32:34,223
Now let's fight our
way out of this thing.

1204
01:33:09,854 --> 01:33:11,360
You're a great partner.

1205
01:33:40,744 --> 01:33:42,124
Thank you.

1206
01:33:42,504 --> 01:33:44,064
Sorry I ran.

1207
01:33:44,344 --> 01:33:45,624
Yeah, that's been a rough night.

1208
01:33:45,959 --> 01:33:47,559
How many more out there?

1209
01:33:47,787 --> 01:33:49,334
I didn't see any.

1210
01:33:49,469 --> 01:33:50,469
Verris?

1211
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:52,810
Out of commission.

1212
01:33:53,401 --> 01:33:55,141
But still alive?

1213
01:33:57,411 --> 01:33:58,711
Yes.

1214
01:34:28,321 --> 01:34:29,321
Here.

1215
01:34:29,776 --> 01:34:30,843
How bad is that?

1216
01:34:31,187 --> 01:34:32,187
I'm fine.

1217
01:34:33,801 --> 01:34:35,261
You're not.

1218
01:34:36,571 --> 01:34:37,911
Hold the elevator position.

1219
01:34:37,912 --> 01:34:39,352
We gonna secure an out.

1220
01:35:50,672 --> 01:35:51,672
Back off!

1221
01:37:18,290 --> 01:37:20,180
Don't you feel pain?

1222
01:37:51,545 --> 01:37:54,014
I don't know why
you're so angry, Henry?

1223
01:38:04,758 --> 01:38:07,208
You were the
inspiration for all of this.

1224
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:22,086
You know where I got the idea?
Are you okay?

1225
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:26,286
Khafji.

1226
01:38:27,626 --> 01:38:31,031
Watching you go house to house,
wishing I had a whole division of men -

1227
01:38:31,319 --> 01:38:32,569
all as good as you.

1228
01:38:33,211 --> 01:38:35,418
Wondering if that
could be possible.

1229
01:38:36,011 --> 01:38:37,531
You should be flattered.

1230
01:38:40,211 --> 01:38:41,931
You should be dead.

1231
01:38:42,181 --> 01:38:44,341
You saw what
happened over there.

1232
01:38:45,221 --> 01:38:46,781
An atrocities.

1233
01:38:48,651 --> 01:38:51,091
Friends being sent home
in a pine box.

1234
01:38:51,121 --> 01:38:54,698
Why should we accept that
If there is a better way?

1235
01:38:58,135 --> 01:39:00,925
And look what we created.

1236
01:39:05,892 --> 01:39:07,426
It's got both of us in.

1237
01:39:09,022 --> 01:39:11,604
Don't you think
your country deserves

1238
01:39:11,605 --> 01:39:13,272
a perfect version of you?

1239
01:39:13,724 --> 01:39:16,389
There is no
perfect version of me,

1240
01:39:17,102 --> 01:39:19,107
or him, or anybody.

1241
01:39:19,366 --> 01:39:20,386
No?

1242
01:39:21,496 --> 01:39:22,604
He was on his way to Yemen.

1243
01:39:22,737 --> 01:39:23,539
Now thanks to you

1244
01:39:23,540 --> 01:39:26,245
his place is gonna be taken
by someone with parents.

1245
01:39:26,412 --> 01:39:27,838
Someone who feels pain.

1246
01:39:28,374 --> 01:39:29,374
Fear.

1247
01:39:29,548 --> 01:39:31,633
Which we had edited out of him.

1248
01:39:31,634 --> 01:39:34,367
Someone with just as
many weaknesses,

1249
01:39:34,368 --> 01:39:35,852
as the terrorists
that we're trying to kill.

1250
01:39:35,853 --> 01:39:37,560
And you gonna
tell me that's better?

1251
01:39:38,857 --> 01:39:41,090
So why not make
a whole army of 'em?

1252
01:39:41,550 --> 01:39:42,550
Yeah, why not?

1253
01:39:44,108 --> 01:39:46,563
Think how many American
families we can spare.

1254
01:39:46,723 --> 01:39:49,407
Nobody's son, or daughter
would ever have to die.

1255
01:39:49,414 --> 01:39:52,453
No vet comes home
with PTSD and kills himself.

1256
01:39:53,248 --> 01:39:55,447
We can keep the whole world safe

1257
01:39:55,448 --> 01:39:57,990
without any actual grief, so...

1258
01:39:58,249 --> 01:40:00,209
Who would I be hurting?

1259
01:40:00,769 --> 01:40:03,093
You're talking
about people, Clay.

1260
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:04,990
Henry.

1261
01:40:06,135 --> 01:40:09,274
This is the most humane
thing that Gemini's ever done.

1262
01:40:10,055 --> 01:40:12,586
How many more of me
are running around out there?

1263
01:40:13,793 --> 01:40:16,353
There's only one you, Junior.

1264
01:40:17,733 --> 01:40:19,393
He was a weapon.

1265
01:40:20,047 --> 01:40:21,607
You're my son.

1266
01:40:23,696 --> 01:40:25,126
And I love you.

1267
01:40:26,206 --> 01:40:29,926
As much as any father
ever loved any kid.

1268
01:40:34,472 --> 01:40:36,042
I don't have a father.

1269
01:40:37,322 --> 01:40:38,336
Goodbye, Clay.

1270
01:40:38,691 --> 01:40:39,691
Hey, hey.

1271
01:40:47,984 --> 01:40:49,624
So what the hell
are we gonna do?

1272
01:40:51,324 --> 01:40:53,743
Gonna turn him in?
They not gonna try him.

1273
01:40:53,744 --> 01:40:55,649
They not gonna
shot down his lab.

1274
01:40:56,166 --> 01:40:57,781
We have to end
this this right now.

1275
01:40:57,919 --> 01:40:58,919
Hey.

1276
01:41:00,272 --> 01:41:01,632
Look at me.

1277
01:41:03,382 --> 01:41:04,742
Look at me.

1278
01:41:06,112 --> 01:41:07,251
You pull that trigger

1279
01:41:07,618 --> 01:41:10,445
and you gonna break something
inside of yourself.

1280
01:41:12,022 --> 01:41:14,815
That will never get fixed again.

1281
01:41:22,762 --> 01:41:23,922
Don't.

1282
01:41:29,302 --> 01:41:30,592
Let it go.

1283
01:41:31,702 --> 01:41:33,132
Give it to me.

1284
01:41:38,782 --> 01:41:40,972
You don't want those ghosts.

1285
01:41:42,102 --> 01:41:43,492
Trust me.

1286
01:42:22,977 --> 01:42:24,697
You should know
better than that.

1287
01:42:26,199 --> 01:42:27,843
Surprised you give a shit.

1288
01:42:28,969 --> 01:42:31,995
Well...
We can't be friends anymore.

1289
01:42:32,482 --> 01:42:34,556
Because you did
let them try to kill me.

1290
01:42:34,784 --> 01:42:37,925
But, that doesn't mean I wanna
see you drink yourself to death.

1291
01:42:40,186 --> 01:42:42,210
The Gemini lab's
been dismantled.

1292
01:42:42,872 --> 01:42:44,939
Cloning program is history.

1293
01:42:46,641 --> 01:42:48,081
And Junior?

1294
01:42:48,765 --> 01:42:50,230
He's untouchable.

1295
01:42:50,375 --> 01:42:52,842
No one will bother him. Ever.

1296
01:42:53,884 --> 01:42:56,456
And we checked,
there are no more clones.

1297
01:42:57,644 --> 01:42:59,134
What about you?

1298
01:42:59,985 --> 01:43:01,421
IG called.

1299
01:43:01,422 --> 01:43:03,462
I'm looking at charges, but

1300
01:43:03,463 --> 01:43:06,440
if I bury Janet,
I can make a deal.

1301
01:43:07,583 --> 01:43:09,101
She earned it.

1302
01:43:12,821 --> 01:43:15,111
I'm really sorry, Henry.

1303
01:43:18,996 --> 01:43:21,856
- Take care, Dell.
- Yeah, you too. ten thirty

1304
01:43:22,328 --> 01:43:24,218
And happy retirement.

1305
01:43:53,908 --> 01:43:55,548
Hey.

1306
01:43:58,858 --> 01:44:01,328
Hey.

1307
01:44:02,238 --> 01:44:03,301
Good to see you.

1308
01:44:03,763 --> 01:44:05,331
Congrats on a promotion.

1309
01:44:05,500 --> 01:44:06,947
I heard they got big plans.

1310
01:44:06,948 --> 01:44:10,009
Well, after you pretty sure
I can handle anything.

1311
01:44:11,324 --> 01:44:14,296
- How've you been?
- Good, just...

1312
01:44:14,297 --> 01:44:15,618
Settled Baron's estate.

1313
01:44:15,619 --> 01:44:17,997
Scattered his ashes
in the Caribbean.

1314
01:44:19,031 --> 01:44:20,978
I don't know, all I
wanna do now is

1315
01:44:21,082 --> 01:44:22,944
put some good in the world.

1316
01:44:22,945 --> 01:44:24,575
Just got to figure out how.

1317
01:44:25,229 --> 01:44:26,229
Yeah, you will.

1318
01:44:27,158 --> 01:44:28,844
You sleeping okay?

1319
01:44:29,308 --> 01:44:30,308
Better.

1320
01:44:30,508 --> 01:44:33,132
- No ghosts?
- Not like before.

1321
01:44:33,612 --> 01:44:36,032
Oh, and I actually looked
in the mirror the other day.

1322
01:44:36,152 --> 01:44:38,512
- Really?
- It wasn't horrendous.

1323
01:44:40,182 --> 01:44:41,942
Speaking mirrors.

1324
01:44:54,692 --> 01:44:55,952
Catch you later.

1325
01:44:56,974 --> 01:44:57,974
Hey.

1326
01:45:10,966 --> 01:45:11,631
What's this?

1327
01:45:11,801 --> 01:45:13,579
This is you.

1328
01:45:13,738 --> 01:45:17,283
Passport, birth certificate,
driver's license.

1329
01:45:17,644 --> 01:45:19,331
Apparently you got
pretty good credit.

1330
01:45:20,793 --> 01:45:22,432
I love the name you chose.

1331
01:45:22,707 --> 01:45:23,707
Jackson?

1332
01:45:23,788 --> 01:45:24,921
It's my mother's name.

1333
01:45:24,949 --> 01:45:25,352
Hey.

1334
01:45:25,353 --> 01:45:27,220
She was my mother first.

1335
01:45:27,526 --> 01:45:28,526
Yeah, yeah.

1336
01:45:28,632 --> 01:45:30,588
Don't you "yeah, yeah" me,
young man.

1337
01:45:32,330 --> 01:45:34,535
Come on, I know a
good place for lunch.

1338
01:45:38,451 --> 01:45:40,172
So you settled
down on major yet?

1339
01:45:40,173 --> 01:45:41,861
Leaning towards engineering.

1340
01:45:41,862 --> 01:45:42,862
Engineering?

1341
01:45:43,846 --> 01:45:46,116
Yeah, you should listen to her.

1342
01:45:46,186 --> 01:45:49,107
If I were you, which I sorta am,

1343
01:45:49,200 --> 01:45:50,660
I'd go with computer science.

1344
01:45:50,661 --> 01:45:51,682
Save that for grad school.

1345
01:45:51,683 --> 01:45:53,143
You want start with humanities.

1346
01:45:53,253 --> 01:45:54,981
- Okay, don't listen to her.
- Don't listen to him.

1347
01:45:55,005 --> 01:45:56,485
You need a grounding
on the classics.

1348
01:45:56,649 --> 01:45:58,955
Excuse me, I'm trying to
talk to myself over here.

1349
01:45:58,956 --> 01:46:00,960
Yeah, you are talking to yourself,
but you're not talking to him.

1350
01:46:00,961 --> 01:46:03,379
Look, I just made a lot of
mistakes when I was young.

1351
01:46:03,380 --> 01:46:06,377
And I'd actually like to make
some of those mistakes myself.

1352
01:46:06,684 --> 01:46:09,340
What I'm trying to say is, I made
them already so you don't have to.

1353
01:46:09,364 --> 01:46:13,784
- But he's not you.
- Okay, everybody chill the hell out.

1354
01:46:15,751 --> 01:46:16,751
I'm gonna be okay.

1355
01:46:22,248 --> 01:46:23,248
If you're okay,

1356
01:46:24,890 --> 01:46:25,890
I'm okay.

1357
01:46:29,400 --> 01:46:30,720
What?

1358
01:46:31,400 --> 01:46:34,888
I just can't believe that in
30 years I'm gonna look like

1359
01:46:35,062 --> 01:46:36,062
you.

1360
01:46:36,255 --> 01:46:38,172
What? Please. You wish.

1361
01:46:39,561 --> 01:46:42,661
Boy, you better hope you
look like me in 30 years.

1362
01:46:43,558 --> 01:46:48,158
This is 50-year old,
mature man meat

1363
01:46:48,549 --> 01:46:49,777
you're looking at.

1364
01:46:49,778 --> 01:46:50,778
51.

1365
01:46:50,911 --> 01:46:54,040
I brush, I floss. I work hard.

1366
01:46:54,676 --> 01:46:55,996
When you're 50, I bet
you won't be

1367
01:46:56,170 --> 01:46:59,382
dragging your ass around the
track every morning like I do.

1368
01:47:00,066 --> 01:47:02,445
In fact, we can race now.

1369
01:47:02,966 --> 01:47:05,674
We can race right now, we
take it to the corner right now.
