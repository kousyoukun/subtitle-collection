1
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,551
打电话给美国运通公司  说你的卡丢了
Let's call American Express. you lost your card,

2
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,717
而且你忘记了卡号
And you don't know what the number of it is.

3
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:28,519
这主意不错
That's a great one.

4
00:00:28,529 --> 00:00:29,518
假装是老太太
Do the old lady.

我的卡丢了
I lost my card.

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,898
你的口音变来变去的
Your... your accent went in and out on you sometimes.

7
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,264
先是南方口音  然后
I went southern and then...

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,837

I'm sorry to call you in such a frenzy,

11
00:00:43,644 --> 00:00:47,774

18
00:00:58,759 --> 00:01:00,090

25
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:22,374
喂  我没有腿  我要和经理通话
Hi. I have no legs. May I speak to the manager?

26
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,988
如果我收到你们的账单或其他东西是因为
Now, if I get a bill and it's something, like, for...

27
00:01:36,697 --> 00:01:41,066
我连续吃了两份该死的烤牛排
But two times in a row I eat the damn roast beef and I'm...

28
00:01:42,135 --> 00:01:45,696
结果一直上洗手间
I can't stop going to the bathroom!

29
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:48,468
对不起  我无能为力
Well, I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do for you.

30
00:01:48,575 --> 00:01:49,803
妈妈
Ma?

31
00:01:50,577 --> 00:01:52,738
我儿子觉得我疯了
And my son thinks I'm crazy.

32
00:01:52,846 --> 00:01:54,245
妈妈  你在和谁打电话
Ma, who you calling?

33
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,475
杰里熟食店  别告诉我不能打给他们
It's Jerry's. And don't tell me not to call them.

34
00:01:56,583 --> 00:01:58,642
天呐  把该死的电话挂了
Jesus christ, get off the fucking phone!

35
00:01:58,752 --> 00:01:59,719
不要这样和我说话
Don't talk to me that way!

36
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,720
快把该死的电话挂了
Get off the fucking phone!

37
00:02:01,822 --> 00:02:02,789
怎么了
What's going on?

38
00:02:02,889 --> 00:02:04,151
老戏码了
Same thing as the last time.

39
00:02:04,257 --> 00:02:05,519
她  她和你说了什么
Did she... what'd she call you about?

40
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:06,786
-烤牛排吗  -是的
- The roast beef? - Yes.

41
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:08,861
好吧  她刚刚在厨房吐了
All right, she just puked in the kitchen.

42
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,328
没关系  我建议她不要再吃烤牛排了
That's all right. I suggested that she doesn't eat roast beef

43
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:13,331
烤牛排不适合她
If it doesn't agree with her.

44
00:02:16,303 --> 00:02:22,708
谢谢你的建议  可我很爱吃烤牛排
I... I appreciate your suggestions, but I love roast beef.

45
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:24,299
味道美极了
It's delicious!

46
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,478
去把那堆脏东西清理了
Go clean up the mess!

47
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:29,811
我不去  放开我
I can't. Get off of me!

48
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,717
你这个混蛋
You son of a bitch!

49
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,486
乔治
George?

50
00:03:25,238 --> 00:03:26,432
你好  西蒙斯先生
Hi, Mr. simmons.

51
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:27,802
你们好  女士们
Ladies.

52
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:32,302
乔治・乔治  老兄  能和你拍张照吗
George Simmons, man! Can I get a picture?

53
00:03:32,713 --> 00:03:35,238
是的  准备好了吗  好了  拍吧  宝贝  好了
Yeah, yeah. You got it ready? All right, hit me, baby, all right.

54
00:03:35,348 --> 00:03:37,179
快  贴紧一点
Get a little tittie in there. Come on.

55
00:03:37,384 --> 00:03:38,715
-你好吗  -你真有趣
- How are you? - You're really funny.

56
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,343
谢谢  你更有趣
Thank you. You're funnier.

57
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:45,881
先生们  先生们  你们好
Gentlemen. Gentlemen. Hey, what's up?

58
00:03:45,992 --> 00:03:47,459
你们好
Hey. How are you?

59
00:04:01,475 --> 00:04:02,965
-你好  帅哥  -医生
- Hey, handsome. - Doctor.

60
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,043
你好  孩子
How are you, kid?

61
00:04:04,144 --> 00:04:05,111
你好  宝贝
How are you, baby?

62
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:08,437
安定片很有用  宝贝
The lunestas are working, baby.

63
00:04:08,548 --> 00:04:10,846
药效温和  没有副作用
Those are smooth. No hangover.

64
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:15,581
入睡很快  骗人  为什么要吃安眠药
Fall asleep, bam. fucking what was the deal with the restorils?

65
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:17,284
你为什么让我服这些 
Why did you give me those? 

66
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:19,284
你要和我上床
You trying to fuck with me or something?

67
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:23,055
乔治  你的血常规报告
George, we got the results back

68
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:23,055
出来了
From the follow-up of your blood count

69
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,757
结果不是我们所希望的
And it's not what we hoped for.

70
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:29,495
我之前提过  你的血球数不正常
As I mentioned earlier, the CBC was abnormal.

71
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,404
白细胞数是
Your white blood cells were four times

72
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:34,404
正常值的四倍
The size that they should be.

73
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:38,274
而血红蛋白又很低  每100毫升只有七克
And very low hemoglobin, seven grams per deciliter.

74
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:40,437
我不明白你在说什么
I don't understand what you're saying right now.

75
00:04:40,547 --> 00:04:43,038
你能说得简单点吗
Can you speak how people speak?

76
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:46,551
你得了重病  急性骨髓性白血病
You have a very serious disease. It's called AML.

77
00:04:46,653 --> 00:04:48,653
白血病的一种 
It's a form of leukemia and

78
00:04:48,653 --> 00:04:51,352
我不知道病情会如何发展
I can't predict how this will play out,

79
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:55,053
但我知道你前途布满荆棘
But I feel you have a rough road ahead of you.

80
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:02,628
那是乔治・西蒙斯 
That's George Simmons, right here.

81
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:04,033
乔治  乔治  乔治・西蒙斯
George! George! George Simmons!

82
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,537
老兄  你怎样  我是你影迷
Hey, man! How, how you doing, man? I'm a big fan of yours.

83
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:28,459
抱歉我不得不告诉你 
I'm sorry to say we're past the point

84
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:30,759
以你目前的状况
Where traditional structures

85
00:05:30,864 --> 00:05:34,527
化疗和放疗都没用了
Like chemotherapy and radiation would be effective at all.

86
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,229
我想最好是去找还在试验中的疗法
And I think it's best for us to pursue an experimental course.

87
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:46,110
给你  女士  这是你的达玛雷斯(一种食物)
Here you go, ma'am. Your tamales.

88
00:05:46,213 --> 00:05:47,612
-谢谢光临奥托  -嘿  恰克
- Thanks for shopping at Otto's. - Yo, chuck,

89
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,340
我要去喜剧魔术俱乐部表演单口相声
I'm going up at the comedy & magic club doing stand-up.

90
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,644
你该来看我表演
You should come watch me.

91
00:05:51,751 --> 00:05:54,219
别被他说动了  他不是个幽默的人
Don't let him suck you in. he's not funny.

92
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,919
他说得对  老兄  我不去  那太痛苦了
Nah, he's right, man. No way, man. That shit was painful.

93
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:59,014
看你在台上受难太痛苦了
I mean, it was hard watching you suffer up there.

94
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:00,752
看过那以后我一直做噩梦
I had fucking nightmares after that.

95
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,328
很久前的事了  好几个月前了
That was a long time ago. That was months ago.

96
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:03,589
那以后我幽默多了
I've gotten a lot funnier since then.

97
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:04,823
你还让我老婆无聊得睡着了
Then you bored my wife to sleep.

98
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,262
害我那晚没得做爱  老兄
I couldn't get no pussy that night, man.

99
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,857
这事不能怪我
Don't blame me for your pussy issues.

100
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:10,459
-他们付你钱吗  -付钱  没有
- Are they gonna pay you? - Pay me? No!

101
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,470
刚开始是这样  刚开始拿不到钱
That's just how it starts. You don't get paid in the beginning.

102
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,665
你得一级一级往上爬
You gotta, you know, work your way up through the ranks.

103
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:16,638
朋友  妈的你无一技之长
My nigger, how the fuck you in show business

104
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,142
怎么还会在演艺圈里混
When you got no business to show?

105
00:06:18,245 --> 00:06:19,507
我本来该写笑话
I'm supposed to be writing jokes.

106
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:20,807
该去演喜剧
I'm supposed to be doing comedy.

107
00:06:20,914 --> 00:06:23,075
而不是在这做通心面沙拉
I'm not supposed to be making macaroni salad.

108
00:06:23,183 --> 00:06:25,879
我讨厌这个  太令人沮丧了  奥托不是好公司
I hate it, man. It's depressing. Otto's sucks!

109
00:06:25,986 --> 00:06:28,079
老兄  你根本受过他妈的挫折
You don't know about no motherfucking hard time, man.

110
00:06:28,188 --> 00:06:31,385
我有前科  老兄  只有奥托肯雇我
I'm a ex-convict, man. otto's the only place that would hire me.

111
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,583
你优秀到奥托请不起了吗
You too good for otto's now?

112
00:06:32,692 --> 00:06:33,681
我没那么优秀
I'm not too good for it.

113
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:34,953
我只是不  它不适合我  对不起
I just don't... it's not for me, you know, I'm sorry.

114
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,050
看看这假牙  1200美元
See that bridge? 1,200 bucks.

115
00:06:38,096 --> 00:06:39,085
好吧
Okay.

116
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:41,893
都是奥托付的  老兄  奥托就是我的乐透(彩票)
On the house, man! Otto, man! Otto's my lotto.

117
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,525
别这样  老兄  我没法在这儿继续工作了
Come on, man, look. I can't work here anymore, all right?

118
00:06:44,636 --> 00:06:46,331
你要上电视还是要干什么
What, you gonna be on TV or some shit like that?

119
00:06:46,438 --> 00:06:47,303
我要上电视 
I am gonna be on TV. 

120
00:06:47,303 --> 00:06:48,303
演个矮胖的服务生还是其他屁事
The chunky guy on survivor or some shit?

121
00:06:48,407 --> 00:06:49,840
不  我要像宋飞一样
No, I'm gonna be like Seinfeld.

122
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,670
想得美  老兄
Get the fuck out of here, man!

123
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,077
你不可能像宋飞那样
You ain't gonna be like seinfeld.

124
00:06:53,178 --> 00:06:55,146
我他妈的大爱宋飞
Seinfeld's my motherfucking man!

125
00:06:55,247 --> 00:06:56,544
还是像克莱默  
Now Kramer,

126
00:06:56,648 --> 00:06:59,344
克莱默还不错  他是我朋友才这么说的
Kramer gets a pass from me 'cause kramer's my nigger.

127
00:06:59,451 --> 00:07:01,476
你可真博爱
Well, very forgiving of you.

128
00:07:01,586 --> 00:07:03,713
身为你的朋友  老兄  我告诉你
Look, as a friend, man, let me tell you something.

129
00:07:03,822 --> 00:07:05,390
-你不幽默  -我觉得我挺幽默呢
- You're not funny. - I think I'm funny.

130
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,517
我有新的笑话  老兄  都很好笑
I got new jokes, man, and they're good.

131
00:07:07,626 --> 00:07:08,894
说一个来听听
Let me hear one of your new jokes.

132
00:07:08,894 --> 00:07:10,919
好  听着
Okay, I got one like,

133
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:13,497
我在游戏厅里是玩吉他游戏的高手
I'm really good at guitar hero, you know, on playstation,

134
00:07:13,598 --> 00:07:15,094
于是我想  既然玩得这么好
And I was so good at it, I thought, like, 

135
00:07:15,094 --> 00:07:16,294
也许我该买一个吉他
"Maybe I should get a guitar. "

136
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:18,301
然后我想  侠盗猎车我也玩得很好
Then I thought like, "i'm really good at grand theft auto,

137
00:07:18,403 --> 00:07:20,268
也许我可以痛殴盗车贼
"maybe I should start beating up hookers. "

138
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,631
好吧  真好笑  太有趣了
Okay, that got me. That was humorous.

139
00:07:22,741 --> 00:07:24,038
我就知道你喜欢
I thought you'd like that.

140
00:07:24,142 --> 00:07:25,507
但是我没钱  老兄
But, yo, I ain't got no dough, man.

141
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,241
真的  如果我有钱  我就去了
For real, if I had some dough, I would go.

142
00:07:27,245 --> 00:07:28,512
我替你付服务费
I'll pay your cover charge.

143
00:07:28,513 --> 00:07:30,239
晚上我会带老婆去
That's the night I take my wife out also,

144
00:07:30,347 --> 00:07:32,036
你也得替她付
So you gotta pay for my bitch, too.

145
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:34,161
好  我付  如果你去了  记住大声笑
Okay, I'll do it. Okay. If you come and laugh, laugh loud.

146
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,394
-像这样吗  -就这样  太棒了
- Like that? - That's good. Perfect.

147
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:37,472
那周六晚上见
I'll see you Saturday then.

148
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:38,562
好  谢谢
Okay, good. Thank you.

149
00:07:38,674 --> 00:07:40,904
克雷格  听我说  我尽力了
Craig, listen to me. I'm doing the best I can, okay?

150
00:07:41,009 --> 00:07:43,971
小时候都是我替你处理善后 
I wiped your ass our entire childhood. 

151
00:07:43,971 --> 00:07:45,671
现在轮到你了  老兄
Now it's your turn, buddy!

152
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:46,876
是你让魔术师
Well, you're the one that asked the wizard 

153
00:07:46,876 --> 00:07:47,876
把你变年轻
To make you young again.

154
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:49,314
不是这样的年轻
I didn't mean this young!

155
00:07:50,986 --> 00:07:52,749
上次我穿着礼服是在受戒仪式上
Last time I had a suit on, at my bar mitzvah.

156
00:07:52,855 --> 00:07:54,550
我的受戒仪式  那是最后
My bar mitzvah, it was the last...

157
00:07:54,656 --> 00:07:56,283
现在我穿着同样的礼服  就是那套
And now I got the same suit. It's the same suit.

158
00:07:56,391 --> 00:07:57,391
我觉得这衣服不错
I think it looks good. 

159
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:59,724
受戒礼是我一生最美好的一天
The bar mitzvah was a good day in my life.

160
00:07:59,828 --> 00:08:02,194
那天我赚到了这辈子最多的钱
I made more money that day than I think I'll ever make again.

161
00:08:03,365 --> 00:08:06,493
有点难过  13岁达到事业巅峰感觉很奇怪
You know, it's really sad. To peak at 13 is a weird feeling.

162
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:07,569
这预示着那种
This is indicative of the kind of...

163
00:08:07,669 --> 00:08:09,227
拍那边  看那
Yo. yo. Shoot that. Look at that!

164
00:08:09,338 --> 00:08:12,569
那俩姑娘继续走  那人在MTV台工作
Both those girls just go, "That's the guy from MTV."

165
00:08:12,674 --> 00:08:15,234
我发誓那俩姑娘看都没看他
I swear on my life, those two girls, they were just going,

166
00:08:15,344 --> 00:08:17,778
是那人  第二次发生了
"That's the guy. " it's the second time it happened.

167
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:22,180
我下了  我下了  我下了汽车
I got off a... I got off, I got off the bus, and...

168
00:08:22,284 --> 00:08:24,184
我指火车  我继续走着
I mean, the train. I'm walking out...

169
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,120
我和安换了班  我家人从格林贝来了
Me and Ann traded shifts. My family's in from Green Bay.

170
00:09:03,225 --> 00:09:04,360
来看他们女儿
You know, come to see 

171
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,160
在大城市里过得怎样
How their daughter's doing in the big city.

172
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:08,354
等等  你在这儿上学对吧
You know, wait, you went to school here, right?

173
00:09:10,732 --> 00:09:11,699
喂
Hello?

174
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,997
喂  劳拉  我是乔治
Hey, Laura, it's george.

175
00:09:15,103 --> 00:09:18,766
你在加利福尼亚的北方过得怎样
How's the northern side of California going?

176
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,336
你想干什么  乔治
What do you want, George?

177
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:24,078
不知道你有没有空  就几分钟
I was wondering if you had a few minutes.

178
00:09:24,179 --> 00:09:27,171
我想和你谈谈
I wanted to talk to you about something.

179
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:32,109
我没空  我刚刚出门
Actually, I don't. I was just walking out the door.

180
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,614
要不给我你的电话
Is it okay if I get your number

181
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,314
我晚点打给你  好吗
And I'll give you a call back later?

182
00:09:36,024 --> 00:09:37,992
我知道我不该打给你
I know I'm not supposed to call you.

183
00:09:38,093 --> 00:09:40,561
我只想让你知道
I just wanted to let you know that,

184
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:45,395
我真的对所发生的一切感到抱歉
That I really am so sorry about everything.

185
00:09:47,536 --> 00:09:49,527
对不起  是我搞砸了
I'm sorry, I screwed up.

186
00:09:51,573 --> 00:09:53,473
可惜你没早认识到  
Too bad you didn't realize that back then, but

187
00:09:53,575 --> 00:09:56,840
不管怎样  我要走了  要我晚点打给你吗
Anyway, I gotta go. Do you want me to call you back?

188
00:09:57,879 --> 00:10:00,746
不用  不用打了  我知道你也不会打
No, you don't have to call me back. I know you're not going to,

189
00:10:00,916 --> 00:10:04,249
我只想让你知道  再一次对你说对不起
But I just wanted to let you know I was sorry one more time.

190
00:10:04,353 --> 00:10:07,254
好吧  祝你好运  乔治
Okay. Well, all right. Okay, good luck, George.

191
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,414
好的
Okay.

192
00:10:14,914 --> 00:10:17,081
我这个笑话是关于
You know, so, like, I have this joke about how, 

193
00:10:17,081 --> 00:10:18,281
你从没见过的
Like, you never see, like,

194
00:10:18,384 --> 00:10:21,876
一个很吸引眼球  金发大胸的流浪女
A very attractive, blonde, big-breasted homeless woman.

195
00:10:21,987 --> 00:10:23,479
不管怎样 
You know, like, someone will 

196
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:25,479
有人会照顾她
Take care of that person no matter what.

197
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:27,456
-那女人会过得很好  -好吧  我讲个笑话
- That woman's gonna be fine. - All right, so here's the joke.

198
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,926
你可以很迷人也可以很蠢的活着
You can be attractive and stupid and make it in the world.

199
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:30,996
是的
Yeah.

200
00:10:31,096 --> 00:10:32,256
你可以不迷人但聪明
And you could be unattractive and smart

201
00:10:32,364 --> 00:10:33,524
然后就这么过下去
And make it in the world.

202
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,897
可是丑陋的哑巴才真正搞笑
But it's the ugly, dumb people who are really screwed

203
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:38,663
因为他们愚昧  难看极了
'cause they're ignorant and an eyesore.

204
00:10:38,771 --> 00:10:39,738
太有趣了  老兄
That's funny, man.

205
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,238
那相当有趣  我觉得可以
That's pretty funny. I think that'll work.

206
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,602
我有想过写这样的笑话
I was thinking of doing this thing where, like,

207
00:10:42,708 --> 00:10:44,232
我既不英俊也不丑陋
I'm not good-looking and I'm not bad-looking.

208
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:45,742
你知道  我相貌平平
I'm kind of, like, right in the middle, you know.

209
00:10:45,845 --> 00:10:47,722
如果我性格随和
Like... Like, if I had a good personality, 

210
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:49,440
我就能得到世上任何一个女人
I could get any chick in the world,

211
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,448
-可我没有  -这不好笑
- But I don't. - Yeah, it doesn't work.

212
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:53,381
巴德・弗里德曼曾让我即兴表演过
I auditioned for Budd Friedman at the improv.

213
00:10:53,485 --> 00:10:56,174
他觉得我不错  所以我成了固定演员
He okayed me and made me a regular.

214
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:57,296
巴德看都不曾看过我
Budd won't even look me in the eye.

215
00:10:57,405 --> 00:11:00,397
老兄  你真走运  祝贺你
Man, that's... good for you, man. Congratulations.

216
00:11:00,508 --> 00:11:02,373
你不该减肥  老兄
You shouldn't have lost all that weight, man.

217
00:11:02,477 --> 00:11:04,135
身体健康的人一点也不有趣
There's nothing funny about a physically-fit man.

218
00:11:04,145 --> 00:11:05,942
-我知道  瘸子才有趣  -是的  
- I know. It's lame, right? - Yeah.

219
00:11:06,047 --> 00:11:07,947
没人想看兰斯・阿姆斯特朗演喜剧
No one wants to watch Lance Armstrong do comedy.

220
00:11:08,049 --> 00:11:09,277
天哪
Oh, god.

221
00:11:09,384 --> 00:11:10,544
艾拉
Hey, Ira.

222
00:11:10,651 --> 00:11:12,314
马克  能不能帮帮忙  
Oh, hey, Mark. Can you do me a favor 

223
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:13,814
别再把你演情景喜剧
And never leave a paycheck

224
00:11:13,921 --> 00:11:16,389
获得的支票放在我的枕头上了
From your shit sitcom on my pillow ever again, please?

225
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:19,619
我太无礼了  居然把25000美元的支票
That is so rude of me to accidentally leave my paycheck

226
00:11:19,727 --> 00:11:23,424
忘在你的枕头上  对不起
For $25,000 on your pillow. I'm sorry.

227
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:24,498
这种行为让人无法容忍
It's a dick move.

228
00:11:24,599 --> 00:11:25,964
支票不断寄来
It's just, they keep coming,

229
00:11:26,067 --> 00:11:27,261
每周都有
You know, week after week.

230
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:29,393
很难记住它们都在哪里
It's getting a little bit hard to keep track of them all.

231
00:11:29,504 --> 00:11:31,028
知道吗  只不过稍稍出名点
You know what? Becoming marginally famous

232
00:11:31,139 --> 00:11:32,731
就把你变成了混蛋
Has really turned you into an asshole.

233
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,047
我想和你们在这聊天
Now listen, I'd love to stay here and chat with you, 

234
00:11:35,047 --> 00:11:36,547
但是外面有客人
But we have company.

235
00:11:37,078 --> 00:11:39,239
知道住在街对面的那个喜剧女演员吗
You know that girl comedian who lives across the street?

236
00:11:39,347 --> 00:11:40,974
黑头发  有刘海的那个
The one with the dark hair and the bangs?

237
00:11:41,082 --> 00:11:42,140
-戴西  -戴西  是的
- Daisy, yeah. - Daisy, right.

238
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,447
我刚在外面遇到她  并邀请她进来坐坐
Well, I bumped into her outside and I invited her in,

239
00:11:45,553 --> 00:11:48,113
她现在客厅坐着
And she's sitting in our living room right now.

240
00:11:48,222 --> 00:11:49,519
她在外面吗
She's out there right now?

241
00:11:49,624 --> 00:11:52,457
她很性感  又很胆小  有点像
She's hot and she's mousy, but kind of like...

242
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,892
她胆小如鼠  你还想干她
She's mousy like a mouse you want to stick your dick in.

243
00:11:54,996 --> 00:11:56,896
你们出来和她聊聊吧
Yeah, you've gotta get out there and talk to her.

244
00:11:56,998 --> 00:11:57,965
为什么这样做
Why would you do that?

245
00:11:58,066 --> 00:11:59,397
什么意思  我为什么这样做
What do you mean, why would I do that?

246
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,467
我在帮你
I'm trying to hook you up.

247
00:12:00,568 --> 00:12:01,728
我正在构思  老兄
Well, I'm laying groundwork, man.

248
00:12:01,836 --> 00:12:03,770
我有个3个月的计划  别让我做这事
I got a three-month plan. You can't just throw me into this.

249
00:12:03,871 --> 00:12:05,998
你那3个月的计划10天就搞定了
I'll give you 10 days on your three-month plan.

250
00:12:06,107 --> 00:12:07,665
不  我还需要额外的80天
No, I need 80 more days than that!

251
00:12:07,775 --> 00:12:10,302
我这么做是关心你  
Okay, I do this because I care about you. 

252
00:12:10,302 --> 00:12:11,802
是启发你
I do this to motivate you.

253
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:15,781
我要在10天内搞定她  我保证
But I will fuck that girl in 10 days. I promise.

254
00:12:15,883 --> 00:12:17,544
拜托  老兄  我没有你可爱
Come on, dude, I'm not cute like you.

255
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:20,951
我不像杰克逊・布朗  我像乔恩・费儒
I don't look like Jackson Browne. I look like Jon Favreau!

256
00:12:21,055 --> 00:12:23,523
不要这样对我  别让我和她上床
Don't do this to me. Don't make me fuck her.

257
00:12:23,624 --> 00:12:24,886
好  那就不上床
Well, then just don't fuck her!

258
00:12:24,992 --> 00:12:26,324
你非得把我逼到这个地步
Don't you put me in this corner 

259
00:12:26,324 --> 00:12:27,324
才甘愿吗
Where I have to fuck my way out.

260
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:30,329
他会这么做  他会的  我见过他这么做过
He'll do it, too. he'll do it. I've seen him do this before.

261
00:12:30,431 --> 00:12:33,423
我先出去和她聊聊  你马上出来
I'm gonna go out there and warm her up. I'll see you out there.

262

292
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:28,855
是啊  都是从我小鸡鸡上减下来的
Yes, I did. All from my cock.

293
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,186
呃  那什么
Um... so...

294
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:36,062

See you in nine days, Ira!

303
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:58,277
最近我去了一地方
I went to a place recently

304
00:13:58,385 --> 00:13:59,472
那是我去过的
I'm convinced is the most 

305
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:01,286
最诡异最疯狂的地方了
fucked up, crazy place I've ever been to.

306
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:06,849
那地方叫做"蛋蛋冰工厂"
It's a little place called Cold Stone Creamery.

307
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,427
在蛋蛋冰工厂呢...
Now, the thing at Cold Stone is...

308
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,054
观众居然会喜欢听这个
I can't believe this is what people like.

309
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:17,695
有"不错嘛""真不错""就是它了"几种码型
The sizes are "like it," "love it" and "gotta have it!"

310
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:20,939
什么鬼说法啊这是
What kind of crackhead terminology is that?

311
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,099
"哥们  要什么型号的"
"What size you want, man?"

312
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,177
"我不知道啊  就是它了
"i don't know, man, I just gotta have it!

313
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:26,610
给我装杯冰激淋  再撒点碎巧克力
"Put some ice cream in a cup with some sprinkles!

314
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:29,444
把你的棍棍放进去自慰给我看"
Put your dick in a butterfinger and fuck it for me, please!

315
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,750
"快放进去  
"Put it in the cup! 

316
00:14:30,751 --> 00:14:32,951
我等不及了  等不及了
I need it! I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking!

317
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:35,647
等不及了  等不及了  等不及了
I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking!

318
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:37,747
等不及  等不及  等不及"
I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking!"

319
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:40,850
你小子快看看  我就是这么干
That's how it's done, son! That's how it's done, son!

320
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:43,525
简直嗨翻天  观众都快乐死了
Killed it, man. Crowd was crazy.

321
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,530
周三的场子总是这么狂野吗
Is it always that wild on a Wednesday?

322
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:47,259
没有  不过这次他们倒是真挺高兴
No, they were... they seem pretty good out there.

323
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:48,334
我简直已经登堂入室
I'm really stepping up my game.

324
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:51,063
那帮家伙得付我钱了
These bitches gotta start paying me for this.

325
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:52,871
不能让他们白乐呵  
Can't get no more free randy. 

326
00:14:52,872 --> 00:14:54,572
都给他们伺候成这样了
I just fucked that crowd in the ass.

327
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:55,642
是啊
Yeah.

328
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,711
真他妈太爽了
Just awesome. Just fucking bam!

329
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:02,009
万人拥戴啊  我就靠鸡巴打天下了
Crowd, me, bam! Crowd, me... My stand-up's my dick.

330
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:05,976
你知道吗  我也准备这么干
You know? I'm gonna do the same thing.

331
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,718
狗屁  给爷来点巧克力豆和薯片
Bullshit! Let's get some m&m's and chips going.

332
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,812
-黄色的耶  -艾拉
- Yellow! - Ira!

333
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,536
凯文・鲁尼还没来
Hey. Kevin Rooney didn't show up,

334
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,044
你就在里昂之后表演10分钟吧
So you're gonna do 10 minutes after Leo.

335
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,374

Really? Okay. thanks. Yeah.

336
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,382
行啊  谢谢
"Yeah, thanks, yeah. "

337
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:30,286
他让你下一个上台吗
Hey. Did he just tell you you're going on next?

338
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:32,294
-对  下一个就是我  -行  你后面是我
- Yeah, I'm on next. - Okay. well, I'm on after you,

339
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:34,694
你要是说太久  这东西就得死在我口袋里了
And if you go long, this is going to die in my pocket.

340
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,367
没跟你开玩笑  我不是来搞笑的
That wasn't a joke. I'm not a comic.

341
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:40,968
亮灯就表示你还剩一分钟  知道了吧
Okay, when you get the light that means one minute.

342
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:42,038
知道了
Okay.

343
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:44,398
有天晚上  我听到我的蛋蛋和小弟弟在聊天
The other night, I heard my balls and my dick talking.

344
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:46,497
蛋蛋这么说
And my balls were like,

345
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:48,455
"你还撑得住吗
"are you okay?

346
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,021
他弄疼你了吗"
"Is he hurting you?"

347
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,825
小鸡鸡就回答  "我比你了解他
And my dick's like, "you don't know him like I do.

348
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:58,097
他才不会弄疼我呢  他爱死我了"
"He's a great guy. He loves me. "

349
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,835
乔治・西蒙斯突然来了
Hey. George Simmons just showed up.

350
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:05,070
他想上台  所以你再等会
He wants to go on, so you are bumped.

351
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:06,679

364
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,000
这他妈的太棒了  哥们
That's fucking awesome, man!

365
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:31,433
哦耶

366
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:34,267
好啦
All right!

367
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,144
行了行了  我都有点害怕了
Yeah, all right, I'm scared.

368
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:40,509
害怕你们这帮人
I'm scared for all of you guys.

369
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:44,550
你们需要我啊  可我总有一天会退休
You need me! you need me. I'm not gonna be here forever.

370
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:49,446
等我走了谁逗你们乐啊  其实挺简单的
Who's gonna amuse you? It's so simple.

371
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:50,716
你们就互相看着  然后说点这个
You just look at each other and say...

372
00:16:53,226 --> 00:16:54,815
大家就都乐了
Everyone's laughing.

373
00:16:55,679 --> 00:16:57,601
你们真是太无趣了
You people are so unamusing

374
00:16:57,602 --> 00:17:01,206
无趣到还得雇人来逗你们乐
you have to pay another person to come and amuse you. 

375
00:17:01,207 --> 00:17:03,850
你们在家都怎么过的啊
What do you do at home?

376
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:05,854
就整天跟那儿坐着嘀咕吗
Just sit, fucking antsy, all day long,

377
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:08,447
"哎呀  怎么就没点乐子呢
"when are we gonna get to that amusement place?

378
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,857
你逗逗我吧"  你们真该感谢我拍了那些电影
"amuse me. " you should be thanking me for those movies.

379
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:14,221
"哎呀  终于出电影了  咱们看去吧"
"Oh! Finally, a movie. Let's watch it together. "

380
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:15,889
这不就是电影的迷人之处吗
That's the beauty of movies, by the way.

381
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,762
进去坐着  你不用和旁边的人聊天
You go in there and you don't have to talk to each other.

382
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,698
自己就能乐起来了  你们盯着屏幕就想啊
And it's fun. You could stare at the screen.

383
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:22,307
"可能我们俩过得还行吧  
And, "maybe we don't hate each other 

384
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,664
我们都喜欢这片子
'cause we both like this movie.

385
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:27,468
这是我们的共同点哎"
"We are connecting on that.

386
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,707
"我们还过得下去
"Hey, we're still together.

387
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:33,783
这么多年  我们还是相爱的吧"
"All these years later, we still love each other, right?

388
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:35,233
"看电影的时候是相爱的
"During the movie, yes.

389
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:37,444
等电影散场了  你他妈就是一婊子
When the movie's over, 'you fucking bitch.

390
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:43,088
我怎么还没把你甩了  我们八竿子打不着啊
"'Why am I still with you? We have nothing in common.

391
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:45,058
肯定有什么东西变味了"
"'Something's missing. "'

392
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:47,425
反正我不信教
Anyways, I have no religion.

393
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,521
我父母不信上帝
My parents did not believe in god.

394
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,260
挺好的  他们也没忘了教导我
That was great. They passed that along.

395
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:52,460
我没什么可选的
I didn't even have a fucking choice.

396
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,197
他们直接就说  "别  别信那玩意"
They were like, "nope, don't do it. "

397
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:57,739
"不能信啊  那爷爷要是死后会上天堂吗"
"Really? So, when grandpa dies he goes to heaven?"

398
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:00,275
"不会  他会被埋到土里头"
"Nope, he'll be in the ground. "

399
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:02,572
"好的  老爸  我现在能不能闭眼睡觉啦
"Thanks, dad. Should I sleep now? 'cause i...

400
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,408
你这么一说  我肯定不会做恶梦的"
"there's no way I'll have a nightmare tonight. "

401
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:07,347
"滚你的  我才不信有恶梦呢
"Fuck you. I don't believe in nightmares, either.

402
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:09,383
基佬才会做恶梦
"Fags have nightmares.

403
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:13,522
要是真有上帝  大屠杀又是怎么回事
"If there was a god, why would there be a holocaust?

404
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:15,402
睡吧小子  做个好梦"
"Go to bed, son. Pleasant dreams. "

405
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:16,474
有点黑色幽默啊
Simmons is getting a little dark.

406
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:17,735
这都什么跟什么
What is he doing?

407
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,271
当你听到服务员的脚步声
When you hear the waitress's footsteps

408
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:27,481
就说明你没听明白我的笑话
that's when you know you're not doing well.

409
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:33,323
唉  真是冷场啊
Oh, boy, it's quiet in here.

410
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:38,087
听见没
You hear that?

411
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:43,026
静得我都能听见公路上的声音了
I think I can hear the freeway.

412
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,337
大家好  我是艾拉・莱特
Hello! I'm Ira Wright.

413
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:50,940
我不帅也不丑
I'm not good-looking and I'm not bad-looking.

414
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:52,476
算是相貌平平吧
I'm kind of right in the middle.

415
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:54,978
要是我个性再好点
So, like, if I had a good personality,

416
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,014
可能就有姑娘喜欢我了
That might make it so girls really liked me,

417
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:59,083
可我没啥个性
But I don't. so...

418
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:05,116
乔治・西蒙斯  真牛啊
Okay. George Simmons. wow.

419
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,257
这还让我们怎么活啊
Now what do we do?

420
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:10,727
他富得流油还不高兴  要换了我
He seems unhappy with his money. Give it to me, I'll...

421
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:13,389
我会花得恰到好处
I could really spend that.

422
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,558
要是他对人生沮丧  那我还有什么活头
If he's depressed with his life, I don't know what I'm gonna do.

423
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:19,864
我还睡在我朋友的沙发上呢
I live on my friend's pull-out couch.

424
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:22,998
那我...  听到了吗
So, anyway, I... Wait, did you hear that?

425
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:26,441
我觉着他刚才在后台破相了
Yeah, George Simmons just shot himself in the face backstage.

426
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:28,843
小美人鱼偷偷哭泣咯
It's sad knowing merman's crying inside.

427
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:30,274
啊哦
Uh-oh!

428
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:32,912
他组织集体自杀吗  你也要去吗
Is he organizing a mass suicide? Is that where you're going?

429
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:34,576
要步他后尘啦
Are you joining him?

430
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:37,246
行  倒是省了我的口水了  去吧去吧
Save some kool-aid for me. Just do it.

431
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:38,203
没事儿的
Don't worry,

432
00:19:38,203 --> 00:19:39,678
下一个登场的哥们
The next guy who's coming out 

433
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:41,523
屁股后头还藏了只鸽子
has a dove hidden up his asshole, so...

434
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:43,720
估计是想逼得罗宾・威廉姆斯在这割腕自杀
And then Robin Williams is gonna slit his wrists out here.

435
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:45,160
有何不可呢
So, that's nice, also.

436
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:47,334
我是艾拉・莱特  
I am Ira Wright, everybody. 

437
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:49,063
谢谢大家  祝今晚愉快
Thank you, very much. Have a good night.

438
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,505
有没有搞错啊
Give me a break.

439
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,708
说你呢  嘿
Yo! Hey! Hey!

440
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,919
是你臭小子
This fucking guy.

441
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,118
有何贵干
What's up?

442
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:16,251
不好意思
Hey. I'm sorry.

443
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:20,223
我车停在那边  你挡住我了
I'm parked right on the other side of you and I can't get in.

444
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,800
所以你就过来再嘲弄我的脸是吗
What, you come here to make some jokes to my face now?

445
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,300
你那段很难接  我想不出来才那么说的
You're hard to follow. I didn't know what to say.

446
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:25,734
-对不起啊  -没事儿
- I'm sorry about that. - No, don't be.

447
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:28,598
我也会那么干的  评论几句才能接着讲嘛
I would've done the same. You had to comment on it.

448
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:32,101
对了  你那段挺好的
Yeah, you had some funny shit.

449
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,234
写得不错
You're a good writer.

450
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:34,312
谢谢
Thank you.

451
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:39,415
那人是你朋友吗  那个胖版的你
Your friend... is that your friend? The fatter version of you?

452
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:41,748
那是我舍友  他真挺滑稽的
He's my roommate. Yeah, he's really funny.

453
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,321
你们都挺有料的  好好干  我看好你
You got good stuff. You're gonna be all right.

454
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:46,791
哥们  你能这么说我真是太荣幸了
Wow, that is so nice of you to say, man.

455
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:48,382
真是太...  非常感谢你
That's so... I appreciate it. Hey!

456
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:50,791
你知道么  我们都非常崇拜你
You know, well, I've been a really big fan of yours. All of us.

457
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:53,330
还有啊  我们都是听着你的段子长大的
We kind of grew up on your shit and, you know, incidentally.

458
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,900
你这么说我真是太感谢了  谢谢你啊
So, that's so nice of you to say, man. Thanks.

459
00:20:57,502 --> 00:20:58,662
万分感谢
Thank you!

460
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:01,031
见到你太棒了  哥们
Nice to meet you, man!

461
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,299
你会惨死
You're gonna die!

462
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:08,870
凶手就是我
And I'm gonna kill you!

463
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:14,481
真酷哎
Man, that was awesome.

464
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:26,431
就几只猫
Cats.

465
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,460
你会这么做吗
Can you dig it?

466
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:30,830
就这么简单  拍拍这几只猫
Just a bunch of cats.

467
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:32,936
再拍我做几个动作
Then me doing stuff.

468
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:35,563
再拍它们做动作
Then back to the cats doing stuff.

469
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:39,636
这么个玩意  四天就骗倒了70万点击率啊
You've gotten 700,000 hits in four days from this?

470
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:43,613
你随便往YouTube上传段视频  写上"可爱猫咪"
Yep. If you put "cute kitten" in the title of your youtube video,

471
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:45,182
挣个百万点击率没问题
You're gonna get a million hits. Mmm-hmm.

472
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:46,807
我还把这视频连到了个人主页上
And then I link that to my website

473
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:49,443
人家就能看我表演了  我就是一天才
And you can see my stand-up on my website. It's genius.

474
00:21:49,554 --> 00:21:52,523
你干嘛不直接写上"梅根・福克斯吹箫"呢
Why don't you just call it like, "Megan Fox blows someone"?

475
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:54,990
这样人家一搜她  就也能搜到你了
And then more people would google that.

476
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:58,153
有俩妞一会要来找我
Hi. I've got two girls coming over here in a little bit.

477
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,697
你能不能把床折回沙发里去
Can you fold up your bed, please, into the couch?

478
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,767
我不想让她们看见这乱得一塌糊涂
I don't want the place to look like a mess when they get here.

479
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:03,835
好的  我刚在看这视频来着
Okay, I'm sorry. I was watching this thing.

480
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:06,265
快点好吧
All right? Okay.

481
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,100
喂
Hello?

482
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,169
你好  我是乔治・西蒙斯
Hey, this is George Simmons.

483
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:15,771
你妈的  克雷格  有屁快放
Fuck you, Craig. what's happening, man?

484
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,873
我不是你狗友克雷格  我是乔治・西蒙斯
It's not your dumb-ass friend Craig. it's George Simmons.

485
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:21,241
噢
Oh!

486
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:24,151
对不起对不起  最近过得怎么样
I'm sorry. hey. Hey, how's it going, man?

487
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,225
还行啊  昨晚你说得不错  你们很幽默
Hey, hey, good job last night. You guys were pretty funny.

488
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:30,294
那个比你胖三倍的哥们也是
You and the triple-xl version of you.

489
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:34,662
噢  谢谢  我  我很感激
Oh, yeah, thank... thank you. That's.. .I... well, I appreciate that.

490
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:36,825
你们真挺不错的  干得好
You guys are all right. Good job. I...

491
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:40,694
聚友网搞活动  找我去做表演
I'm doing this corporate gig for Myspace

492
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:44,367
所以我现在得找点段子来
And I'm gonna need some jokes and shit.

493
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:47,070
我想说不定你们能帮我写几个
I was thinking maybe you guys would want to write me some.

494
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:52,709
我那朋友有点古怪  可能不大乐意
You know, he's kind of a flaky guy, but I'm...

495
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:54,183
不过我最近倒挺空闲的
I've got nothing going on, man.

496
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:57,653
我非常愿意参与  算上我吧
I would... I'd love to do that. sure. Totally. I'm in.

497
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,317
你想要什么样的段子呢
What kind of jokes do you need?

498
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:02,819
随便  网民啦电脑啦  对他们的胃口就行
Just shit about them or computers or whatever they like.

499
00:23:02,928 --> 00:23:04,458
随便写点都可以
When you sprinkle a little lemon there, 

500
00:23:04,459 --> 00:23:05,988
把他们忽悠过去
they get excited, you know.

501
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:07,996
了解了  有道理
That's no problem. That makes sense.

502
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,232
你放手写就行了  
So, you want to be held accountable, 

503
00:23:09,233 --> 00:23:10,364
明天就来看我表演吧
come watch me do them tomorrow?

504
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:11,902
-我来接你去  -好的  没问题
- I'll take you to the gig. - Okay, cool, yeah.

505
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:14,639
那我  那我怎么把段子发给你呢
How should i... how should i... how should I get them to you?

506
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:18,304
传真也行  电邮也行啊
I can give you my fax number and my e-mail.

507
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,502
你邮箱多少
What's your e-mail?

508
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:21,806
我的邮箱啊
My e-mail?

509
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:28,148
饥渴的艾拉(英文原意)@yahoo.com
It's irasexira@yahoo. com.

510
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:32,923
天呐  我是不是请错人了
Wow. I'm just... I'm starting to reconsider asking you.

511
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:35,390
别这么说嘛  这是我高中注册的  风靡一时呢
Don't do that. It's from high school. It was funny then.

512
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:36,791
是么  你还是换个邮箱吧
Yeah, you should change it.

513
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:38,624
用了13年了都  好的  我过一段就换
It's, like, 13 years old. Okay, I will.

514
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,992
马上就换
I mean change it now.

515
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:42,225
好的好的  我换  马上换
Okay, I'll change it, I'll change it asap.

516
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:44,996
好的  以后别说"马上的"了
Okay, don't say "asap," either.

517
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:46,444
什么"我爽了"
And don't say "i'm chilling" or 

518
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:48,937
"大家好才是真的好"都别说
"it's all good" or any of that stuff.

519
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,066
好的  不说了  反正我也没多爽过
Okay, I don't. I don't chill anyway, so I won't.

520
00:23:52,177 --> 00:23:54,372
也没什么好的  我不会说了
And it's not all good, so don't worry.

521
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,969
-那就这么着吧艾拉  -行
- Okay, Ira. - Okay.

522
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:57,843
拜拜啦艾拉
All right, Ira.

523
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,785
同志们  这电话是乔治・西蒙斯打来的哎
Guys, that was George Simmons on the phone.

524
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,289
他那天看见我讲笑话
He saw me do stand-up.

525
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:08,757
觉着我讲得挺不错  还让我帮他写段子哎
He thinks I'm funny! He wants me to write jokes for him!

526
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,327
-真的假的  -真的
- What? - Yep!

527
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:11,829
干嘛找你啊
Why?

528
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,420
他觉得我幽默嘛
Why? He thinks I'm funny!

529
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:15,022
这根本说不通嘛
This doesn't make any sense at all.

530
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,100
怎么就说不通了
No?

531
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,296
我得马上开工了
Jeez, I gotta get started.

532
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:20,571
怎么回事这是
What is happening?

533
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:21,866
你还没拾掇床呢
You forgot about the bed!

534
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:27,001
朋友  聚友网上的朋友  怪人
Friends. Friends on Myspace. Nerds.

535
00:24:27,112 --> 00:24:29,580
怪人在现实中都没朋友
Nerds... nerds have no friends in real life.

536
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:31,698
网上越生猛  
The more friends on myspace, 

537
00:24:31,699 --> 00:24:33,139
网下越寂寞
the less friends you have in real life.

538
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:35,185
"聚友网上的垒球队怎么选人的
"How does the softball team at myspace work?

539
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:38,120
阿猫阿狗都能打吗?"  不错吧
"does everyone get picked last?" that could be funny.

540
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:40,657
你应该让乔治骂几句"干他的脸谱网"
At some point, you should have George say, "fuck Facebook!"

541
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,386
"干他那张脸谱大脸"
"Fuck Facebook in the face!"

542
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:47,663
之类的  肯定好玩  别忘了跟他说是我写的啊
So, like, that's funny. All right, tell George I wrote that, okay?

543
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:48,755
-当然  -别忘了写上
- Totally. totally, man. - You gotta be like,

544
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,459
-"这句话是里昂写的"  -没问题
- "Leo wrote that." Yeah. - No, no, no, totally.

545
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:06,110
艾拉  应该是他来了
Hey, Ira, I think this is him!

546
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:11,654
豪华轿车哎
He's got a limo!

547
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:12,745
我们能去和他打个招呼吗
Can we go out and meet him?

548
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:13,984
不  不  你们不能去
No, no, no. You can't say hi to him.

549
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:16,026
等我和他熟络了
Just let me get in with him a little more

550
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:17,389
我再把你们介绍给他
Before I introduce people to him.

551
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:18,894
马屁别拍得太狠了啊
Don't kiss his ass too hard, all right?

552
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:21,090
明星最烦有人马屁拍得过火
Stars hate it when you kiss their ass too hard.

553
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:23,030
-我也烦人家拍我马屁  -是吗
- I hate it when people kiss my ass too hard. - You do?

554
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:24,431
你也会烦噢
You hate it when people kiss your ass too hard?

555
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:25,833
很烦的
I hate it.

556
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:35,012
挺精神嘛
Man!

557
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:37,911
这像是要去舞会啊
Hey. I feel like we're going to prom.

558
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:41,543
是吗  可惜不是  出发吧
Okay, well, we're not. Okay, let's hit it!

559
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,084
写得不错  我喜欢这段
This is good. I like this one

560
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:46,859
就是一个聚友网的用户
About the guy from Myspace and the

561
00:25:46,859 --> 00:25:48,921
和克雷格列表(信息发布网站)的用户大打出手这段
guy from Craigslist getting into a fight.

562
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:50,187
非常搞笑
That's funny.

563
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:51,694
你相当的兴奋嘛
You're excited.

564
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:52,763
我非常的激动
I am excited.

565
00:25:52,864 --> 00:25:53,990
能够兴奋起来是件好事
Yeah, that's good. It's good to be excited.

566
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:55,327
我过去也这样
I used to be excited.

567
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:57,594
实在是太棒了  太令人兴奋了
Well, it's awesome. It's exciting.

568
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:06,575
哇呜
Wow!

569
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,981
谢谢
Thank you!

570
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:27,824
你好
Yeah!

571
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,834
这双腿真漂亮  好样的
Brought the nice legs with you. Good job.

572
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:33,564
-你好  -很高兴见到你先生
- Hello, hello.  - Good to see you, sir.

573
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:34,934
-欢迎登机  -谢谢
-Welcome aboard. - Thank you.

574
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,029
-我叫戴夫  -你好戴夫
- The name's Dave. - Hi, dave.

575
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:37,165
飞行中可能会有些颠簸
We may hit a few bumps up there,

576
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:38,469
不过放心  我们会安全抵达的
Nothing too crazy. We'll get you there.

577
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:39,565
非常好  没问题
Okay, cool! All right.

578
00:26:39,678 --> 00:26:41,612
-希望你喜欢中国菜  -我非常喜欢
- Hope you enjoy Chinese food. - I love it!

579
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:43,613
-太好了  旅途愉快  -谢谢
- Very good. Enjoy your flight. - Thank you.

580
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:45,449
哇
Wow!

581
00:26:50,588 --> 00:26:51,248
你们有点迟到了
You guys were a little late, so we

582
00:26:51,249 --> 00:26:52,715
所以我让詹姆斯・泰勒先顶上了
had to put up James Taylor first.

583
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:55,759
卡伦似一轮银色的太阳
Karen, she's a silver sun

584
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,421
在旁欣赏她的夺目光彩
You'd best walk her way and watch it shine

585
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:03,964
看着她看日出的样子
Watch her watch the morning come

586
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:13,204
银色热泪滚出我的眼眶
A silver tear appearing now that I'm cryin', ain't I

587
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:18,115
我的心已经飞到了卡罗莱纳
I'm going to Carolina in my mind

588
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:19,410
你们是怎么找到他的
How'd you guys get him?

589
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:20,643
大家都互利互赢
Everybody's got their price.

590
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:22,694
去年我们还请到了罗杰・沃特斯
Last year, we had Roger Waters doing

591
00:27:22,695 --> 00:27:23,277
来演月球背面
dark side of the moon.

592
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,950
爱是最美之事
That love's the finest thing around...

593
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:28,505
我觉得如果你上去就说
Okay, I thought it could be 

594
00:27:28,506 --> 00:27:30,061
日脸谱网他妈
funny if you just go,

595
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:32,095
一定会很有效果
"fuck facebook in the face!"

596
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:34,825
好吧  在我上台前你要表演五分钟
All right. Hey, you do five minutes before I go up there.

597
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:37,864
什么  我没法在《火和雨》(台上歌手唱的歌)之后上场
What? no. no, I can't follow fire and rain.

598
00:27:37,865 --> 00:27:38,900
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me, man?

599
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,199
我也做不到  所以才叫你上场
I can't follow it, either. That's why you're going up there.

600
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:48,645
噢
Oh, yeah

601
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,179
谢谢  聚友网的朋友们
Thank you, myspace!

602
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:58,755
傻逼脸谱网
Fuck facebook!

603
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,291
真不敢相信  他居然讲了我说的笑话
I can't believe that. He did the facebook joke!

604
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,056
他骂了脸谱网
Yeah! He did the facebook...

605
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:07,188
我不能在他之后上台  真的不行
I can't follow this, man. I can't go on right now.

606
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:10,995
把这个给我  上去吧  别婆婆妈妈
Give me this shit. Get up there. Be a man.

607
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:14,799
这屋子真大啊
This is a pretty big room.

608
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:18,331
好多人啊
Lot of people here.

609
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:22,382
请各位再次为詹姆斯・泰勒
Let's have another round of

610
00:28:22,383 --> 00:28:23,055
鼓掌喝采
applause for James Taylor, everybody.

611
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,662
你真的用过聚友网吗
Yeah, do you actually use Myspace?

612
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:36,743
我时间都用来泡妞了  没时间干别的
No, no, no. I fuck girls, Tom. I don't have time for that.

613
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:38,650
我在想来自克雷格列表的
I wonder if Tom and Craig

614
00:28:38,651 --> 00:28:39,106
汤姆和克雷格
from craigslist

615
00:28:39,106 --> 00:28:40,777
会一直争吵不休
Would ever get in a fight with each other.

616
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:44,611
那么谁会赢呢  我很想知道
Who would win that fight? That's what I want to know.

617
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,183
汤姆和克雷格谁更厉害一些
Tom or Craig, who's tougher?

618
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:55,056
汤姆有更多的哥们  所以他可能牛一些
Tom has more friends, so that's probably good.

619
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:57,028
然而克雷格的朋友都很怪异
Craig has weirder friends, though.

620
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:01,649
但是我认为克雷格的朋友
Craig has friends that are willing to do a lot more for cash.

621
00:29:01,649 --> 00:29:02,534
为了钱什么都干
I will say that.

622
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,899
怎么回事
Eh?

623
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:10,978
这到底是他妈的怎么回事
What the fuck was that all about?

624
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,603
你把给我写的笑话都用了
You did all the jokes you wrote for me.

625
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:15,012
对不起  我太慌了  他们想听这些
Oh, man, I know. I'm sorry. I panicked. It's all they wanted.

626
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:16,515
他们想听脸谱网的笑话  不想听
They just wanted myspace jokes. They didn't want...

627
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:17,846
这正是我雇你给我写笑话的原因
That's why I hired you to write me Myspace jokes.

628
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,214
非常抱歉  这个  这个我刚才没说
I know, I'm sorry. That one, I didn't tell that one.

629
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,309
这个肯定有效
That one will work.

630
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:21,388
我保证
I guarantee you.

631
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:23,457
最好是这样  他们可付了我三十万呢
It better work. They're paying me 300 grand.

632
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:25,321
-有请乔治・西蒙斯  -真的假的
- Mr. George Simmons! - Really?

633
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:33,692
谢谢  谢谢你  汤姆
Thank you. Thank you. All right, Tom, Thank you.

634
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:37,397
晚上好  讨厌鬼们
Good evening, nerds! Yes!

635
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:38,541
艾拉如何  各位
What about Ira, everybody?

636
00:29:38,542 --> 00:29:40,872
你们觉得艾拉・莱特段子说得如何
How'd you feel about Ira Wright? Yeah.

637
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:42,670
就是那个人
That guy, man.

638
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:43,975
他整个一讨厌鬼
He is such a fucking nerd,

639
00:29:43,975 --> 00:29:46,372
真不敢相信他不是你们的一员
I can't believe he doesn't work with you people.

640
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:51,080
汤姆开通聚友网是为了交朋友
Tom started myspace just to get friends, I know it.

641
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:53,844
所以有人说在聚友网上朋友越多
So, they say the more friends you have on myspace,

642
00:29:53,955 --> 00:29:57,857
真实生活中的朋友就越少
The less friends you have in real life. you know?

643
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:00,621
我在聚友网上有十万个朋友
"I have 100,000 friends on myspace!

644
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:02,663
太好了
"Yes!

645
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:05,025
不值得庆祝吗
"Isn't that great?

646
00:30:05,026 --> 00:30:07,733
我的电脑里有如此多的朋友
I have so many friends on the computer. "

647
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:09,503
你今晚准备干吗
"What are you doing tonight?"

648
00:30:09,604 --> 00:30:11,401
上网
"I'll be on the computer.

649
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:13,900
只是上上网
"That's what I do. "

650
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:20,580
我很讨厌那些冷淡的新新人类
I hate the new generation of coolness out there.

651
00:30:20,682 --> 00:30:24,006
你和他们聊天什么都聊不出
You just never get any information out of people you talk to,

652
00:30:24,006 --> 00:30:24,948
这些年轻人啊
The youngsters.

653
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,180
嘿  你干吗呢  混而已
"Hey, what are you doing?" "Just chilling. "

654
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:30,317
好吧  我知道你在混什么
All right. I know, you're chilling.

655
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:35,829
你今晚准备干什么  办事  好吧
"What're you doing tonight?" "Things. " "Okay. "

656
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:37,111
我喜欢那些人渣
I like dumb people, you know.

657
00:30:37,112 --> 00:30:38,194
他们反而喜欢和你聊
They like to talk to you.

658
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:40,767
嘿  发生什么了  我喜欢棒棒糖
"Hey, what's going on?" "I like lollypops. "

659
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:43,270
好吧
"Good. "

660
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:49,402
我最喜欢的是奶油糖果
"My favorite color is butterscotch. "

661
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:53,809
你唱同一首歌不会腻吗
Do you ever get tired of singing the same songs,

662
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,508
一遍一遍的唱
you know, over and over?

663
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:59,080
你会厌烦拿自己的小弟弟当笑料吗
Do you ever get tired of talking about your dick?

664
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:02,622
我不太  不太喜欢口交
Yeah, I don't like... I don't like blowjobs very much.

665
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:04,487
我不喜欢  可很多人却喜欢
I don't like... A lot of guys like the blowjobs,

666
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:05,914
我不喜欢  
I don't love them. 

667
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:08,119
因为我不知道手放在哪
I never know what to do with my hands. You know?

668
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:10,026
我总是这样
I'm always like...

669
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,960
你只能把手插腰或者用来敬礼
You can either go hands on the hips or the salute is fun.

670
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:22,409
这经常让给你吹箫的女孩很受伤
Yeah, it's always shocking when a girl blows you.

671
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,637
你会说  你真的想搞吗  好吧
You're like, "Really? You want to do it? All right. "

672
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:26,874
我从一些女人那得到了如下建议
I got some advice for the ladies out there.

673
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:31,384
当你帮别人吹箫时千万不要说
When you are performing that act on a fellow don't ever say,

674
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:33,207
你是第一个我能把你整个
"You know, you're the first guy

675
00:31:33,208 --> 00:31:34,546
小弟弟赛进嘴里的男人
I ever got the whole thing in my mouth.

676
00:31:36,457 --> 00:31:38,550
通常我进行到一半时
"Normally, normally, I get, like,

677
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:41,690
就会他妈的喘不过气
Halfway down and I just start fucking choking,

678
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:47,065
可我却能把你的睾丸含在嘴里
"But with you, I got a ball in my mouth!

679
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:49,133
这从来没发生过
"That's never happened!

680
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:53,607
快看  我现在正含着呢
"Look, I have him in my mouth right now,

681
00:31:53,608 --> 00:31:56,071
而且还可以清楚的说话
and I'm speaking perfectly clear.

682
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,772
通常我没法说话的
"Normally I have a stutter. "

683
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:04,641
你不是小便是大便去了吧  太久了
That wasn't a pee, that was a shit. That took too long.

684
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:06,743
这是一千块  干的不错
Here's 1,000 bucks. Good job.

685
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:08,617
谢谢你  哥们
Thank you so much, man.

686
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:10,158
我从来都没挣过这么多钱
I've never made this much money doing anything, 

687
00:32:10,257 --> 00:32:10,953
谢谢你
Man. Thank you.

688
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:14,358
我打算去很多地方表演单口喜剧
Good. I'm thinking about doing a lot more stand-up.

689
00:32:14,462 --> 00:32:15,429
很好
Okay.

690
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,794
而且我的助手怀孕了
And my assistant got pregnant.

691
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:20,231
我都不知道  我本以为她是女同性恋
I didn't even know she... I thought she was a fucking lesbian

692
00:32:20,335 --> 00:32:21,302
我一直这么认为
The whole time, but...

693
00:32:21,402 --> 00:32:22,630
那她们也能怀孕
They can get pregnant, too.

694
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:25,136
好吧  那非常不错
That's nice. That's very nice. Yeah.

695
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:28,731
所以你想当我的助手吗
So, you want to kind of assist me, you know?

696
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:29,935
-当然  -不是搞同性恋
- Yeah! yeah. - I mean, not, not...

697
00:32:30,044 --> 00:32:31,272
我是说你可以帮我写段子
I mean, you can write jokes for me, too,

698
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:32,368
给我拿点喝的
But get me sodas...

699
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,447
非常乐意
Whatever you need, man!

700
00:32:33,548 --> 00:32:35,209
还有帮我收拾残局之类的
And, like, clean my shit up and... yeah.

701
00:32:35,316 --> 00:32:36,806
你现在这一赚多少钱
How much money you make now?

702
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:38,351
要看我干多少小时了
It depends on how many hours.

703
00:32:38,453 --> 00:32:39,715
平时我能挣
Usually, I can get about...

704
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:41,550
我一周给你一千五百块
I'll give you 1,500 bucks a week.

705
00:32:41,656 --> 00:32:43,283
太棒了  非常感谢
That's amazing, man. Thank you so much.

706

You wanna fuck these girls?

712
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:59,999

I filled my quota in 1982, I believe.

713
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:01,234
好吧  我理解你
All right, I'll have to figure this shit out.

714

Will you fucking settle down? Yeah, talk to them. Be gentle.

那人在搞色情杂志吗
That guy in porno?

Really?

那是我的助手艾拉
That's my man, Ira. He wrote a lot of

732
00:33:41,813 --> 00:33:43,428
他给我写了很多好段子
good jokes for me there, honey.

733
00:33:43,534 --> 00:33:46,332
你一定得看看他的小弟弟  非常非常粗
Make sure he shows you his cock. It's very, very thick.

734
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:49,005
拜拜  乔治
See you, George.

735

你都没下去
You didn't go under.

738
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,962
咱们之间什么都不会发生
Nothing's gonna happen between us.

739
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:20,932
真不敢相信我居然和乔治・西蒙斯做爱
I can't believe I'm having sex with George Simmons.

740
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:23,469
你爸爸也不会相信的
Yeah, he can't believe it, either.

741
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:26,207
我爸爸喜欢你的电影
My dad loves your movies.

742
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,939

你朋友走了  她以为你走了
Your friend took off. She thought you left, so...

752
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:10,186
真的假的
Really?

753
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,515
大房子里经常出现这种情况
That's what happens in a big house.

754
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:12,919
传说中的"大房子问题"
It's called "the big house problem. "

755
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:15,617
你朋友把钱包落在门厅了
Your friend actually left her purse down the hall.

756

Oh. Okay.

758
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:25,195
你别跟过来  艾拉
Don't you leave on me, Ira.

759

像雄人鱼一样搞我
Fuck me like merman!

Sorry about the chick, man. I...

765
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:46,287
你没搞成  所以我得去搞
You weren't getting it done, so something had to happen.

766
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,449
没有  她  我甚至没去尝试
Oh, that's... No, she... I wasn't even trying.

767
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:50,288
她说她有男朋友
She told me she had a boyfriend.

768
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:53,288
她帮我吹箫的时候
Oh, yeah. She told me she had a boyfriend, too.

769
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:56,161
她也告诉我她有男朋友了
When she was sucking my cock!

770
00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:02,728
你留着那么大的鸡鸡不用干嘛使
What the fuck are you doing with that big dick of yours?

771
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,003
你得用它  你得和全世界分享它
You gotta use it! You gotta share thickie with the world.

772
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:07,770
我不能  这很正常
I don't... It's normal.

773
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:10,020
你想上楼在我睡着前
You want to go upstairs, man?

774
00:36:10,021 --> 00:36:11,211
跟我聊聊吗
Talk to me while I try to fall asleep?

775
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:14,617
没问题  如果你想让我这么做的话
Okay, if... Yeah, if that's what you want me to do.

776
00:36:15,686 --> 00:36:19,986
坐下  今晚玩的真开心
Yeah, yeah. Sit down, man. That was a fun night.

777
00:36:20,557 --> 00:36:21,546
今晚确实很开心
That was a good night.

778
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:22,625
不过太疯狂了
Yeah, that was crazy.

779
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:23,693
没错
Yeah.

780
00:36:23,794 --> 00:36:26,558
所以你把两个姑娘都搞了
So, you slept with both those girls, man.

781
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:28,657
你怎么做到的
How did you do that?

782
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,861
我怎么做到的  因为
How did I do that? There's this...

783
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:32,727
女孩喜欢名人
Girls like famous guys.

784
00:36:32,728 --> 00:36:34,927
这对她们来说就像传奇
It's a story for them, I guess. I don't know.

785
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:36,733
而我正好利用了这种想法
I take advantage of it, though.

786
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,933
相信我  她们总是失望而归
Believe me, they always leave disappointed.

787
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:41,477
真让人吃惊
That's amazing.

788
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,442
谈谈你自己的名字  艾拉・莱特
Yeah, yeah, so let me hear about this name, Ira Wright.

789
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,415
那不是你的真名  对吗
That's not your real name, right?

790
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:50,212
为什么这么说
How could you tell?

791
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:53,480
因为你有犹太人的味道
You're hiding some judaism.

792
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,455
好吧  我的真姓是维纳
No, my real last name is Wiener.

793
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,288
我真名叫艾拉・维纳
It's Ira wiener and everyone...

794
00:36:57,394 --> 00:36:59,310
和牛肉熏香肠拼法一模一样
It's spelled the same as "wiener" and

795
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:01,330
我总是得去纠正别人
I just got tired of correcting people.

796
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:03,729
所以是你的名字让你走上了喜剧之路
So, that's what led you to the path of comedy.

797
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:06,894
每天都被取笑  第一天上学的时候
Being humiliated every day. First day of school,

798
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:08,995
艾拉・烤肠在吗
"Is Ira Wiener here?"

799
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:10,073
当时你在后面
And you were in the back.

800
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:13,734
维纳  我叫维纳
"Wiener. My name's Wiener. "

801
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:16,244
真可怜  谈谈你父母怎么样
You little fruit. What were your parents like?

802
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:19,315
老维纳夫妇怎么样
What are the older "wieners" or wieners like?

803
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:21,341
我父母离婚了
My parents are divorced.

804
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:26,286
他们恨对方  我妈认为我爸是恶魔
They hate each other. My mother thinks my father's the devil.

805
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:29,785
我不知道他们为什么生我  但是
I don't know what that makes me, technically, but...

806
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:32,320
那样你就不可能像我这么幽默了
So, you'll never be as funny as me.

807
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:33,418
为什么不行
Why not?

808
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,522
你这一辈经历了离婚  只有一点有趣
Your generation has the divorces, which is cute-funny,

809
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:39,275
而我这一代经历的是
But my generation has the, "Oh, my god,

810
00:37:39,275 --> 00:37:42,196
天哪  我爸要拿棒球棍打我
My father's about to hit me with a bat!"

811
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:43,873
我只是
I just...

812
00:37:43,873 --> 00:37:46,118
现在的你比童年时悲惨的你
You gotta break out the funny a lot

813
00:37:46,118 --> 00:37:48,811
可以更快的获得乐趣
Quicker than your little faggy childhood.

814
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,371
你是认真的吗
Are you serious?

815
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:55,883
我整个童年都在想办法逗我爸笑
I spent my whole childhood trying to make my father laugh.

816
00:37:56,553 --> 00:37:59,386
但我依旧没有成功  终究会成功的
I still haven't succeeded, but we'll get there.

817
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:08,728
别走  继续聊天
Don't bail on me yet. Keep it coming.

818
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,491
你第一次碰女孩子是什么时候
When's the first time you fingered a girl?

819
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:12,938
夏令营的时候  
I was at summer camp, 

820
00:38:13,147 --> 00:38:15,226
犹太运动会夏令营
Jewish summer camp, on the sports field.

821
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:22,374
她的名字是莎伦・米兹拉希
And her name was Sharon Mizrahi.

822
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:26,377
我不知道怎么办  当时吓坏我了
I didn't know what to do. I got really scared.

823
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:30,214
她把我推倒然后非常使劲的攥着我小弟弟
She reached down and grabbed my penis really hard,

824
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,151
好像要把它拧断似的
Like she was just trying to murder it.

825
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:43,797
早上好  早
Morning. Yeah, baby.

826
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,767
我花了三小时才找到你的厨房
It took me three hours, but I think I found your kitchen.

827
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,067
这里不会是浴室吧
Am I in the bathroom still? Is that it?

828
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:51,538
没有没有  你找到了安全了
No, no. You're good. you're safe.

829
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:52,642
你拿什么来了
What do you got there?

830
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:54,904
这是药  我病了
This is medicine, Ira. I'm sick.

831
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:56,786
难道昨晚的其中一个有淋病
One of those girls have chlamydia?

832
00:38:56,787 --> 00:38:57,674
我觉得她没病啊
I thought she smelled funny.

833
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:59,408
是这么回事吗
Is that what it is? Yeah.

834
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,978
我有种奇怪的血液病  白血病的一种
I have a weird blood disease.AML. It's a form of leukemia.

835
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:08,418
这是加拿大实验用的药
This is experimental medicine from Canada.

836
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:14,119
8%的有效性  惨吧
There's an 8% chance of it working. So, fuck me.

837
00:39:14,564 --> 00:39:16,930
这不可能是真的  如果是真的
Well, that's not true 'cause if it was,

838
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,661
我肯定能从新闻或报纸上读到
I would've read about it or heard about that.

839
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:19,861
你没听过因为
You didn't hear about it because

840
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,962
我还没向整个娱乐界宣布
I didn't fucking run out and tell entertainment tonight.

841
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:24,904
那你为什么告诉我
Well, why would you tell me?

842
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:26,805
因为我真的不了解你  艾拉
Cause I don't really know you, Ira.

843
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,038
我觉得你不会对此感到奇怪
I think you're not gonna get too weird about this.

844
00:39:30,147 --> 00:39:32,230
我不想像一个快死的人
I don't want to start getting treated like the guy

845
00:39:32,231 --> 00:39:33,480
那样接受治疗
who's gonna die.

846
00:39:33,784 --> 00:39:37,880
无所谓  这药含很多咖啡因
So, anyways, This shit's got a lot of caffeine in it.

847
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:40,923
他们说这是为我好  让我吃这药
They say that's good for you. Let me take the medicine.

848
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:42,548
你为什么告诉我这些
Why are you telling me this, george?

849
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:45,492
因为我希望你能帮我个忙
Cause I want you to possibly do me a favor.

850
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:46,789
行啊  什么
Okay. Yeah. What?

851
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:48,689
杀了我
Kill me.

852
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:50,433
什么
What?

853
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:51,660
没人知道我们彼此认识
Nobody knows we know each other.

854
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:54,328
你只是个路人  你不会被牵涉进来的
You're a stranger. You can get away with this.

855
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:57,566
我房间里有把枪  不能追踪的那种
I got a gun in the other room. It's untraceable.

856
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:00,666
我可以付你5万美金
I'll give you $50,000.

857
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:03,993
别再让我忍受这痛苦了  拜托  
Don't make me suffer. Please 

858
00:40:03,994 --> 00:40:06,807
杀了我吧  艾拉  求你了
Kill me, Ira. I'm begging you.

859
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:09,108
你至少也得给我一个晚上考虑吧
Can you at least give me, like, a night to think about it?

860
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:10,345
哈
Ha!

861
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:12,445
考虑  所以你真会杀我咯
Think about it? You would do it!

862
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:15,218
我恨你  天哪
Oh, I hate you, man. Oh, no!

863
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:17,753
艾拉  我看错你了  
Ira, I misread you. 

864
00:40:17,754 --> 00:40:20,991
你心理有问题  你是个杀人凶手
You're sick! You're a murderer!

865
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:22,087
去你的  混蛋
Screw you, man.

866
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,188
你想杀了我
You wanted to do it!

867
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,791
为了10万美金你会做什么  砍掉我的头吗
What would you have done for $100,000? Chop my head off?

868
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,369
你还想这么做
You would still want to do it!

869
00:40:27,471 --> 00:40:29,200
我刚才的演技不算太好
That wasn't even good acting over there!

870
00:40:29,306 --> 00:40:30,603
妈的  你演得跟真的一样
What the fuck? That was good acting.

871
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:32,698
丹尼尔・戴・刘易斯要被那种演技气死了
Daniel day lewis would've crushed that speech.

872
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:35,403
我记住了  老兄
I bought that, man. Wow!

873
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:38,743
艾拉  你不必杀我  我也快要死了
Ira, you don't have to kill me, but I am gonna die.

874
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:40,980
-乔治  老实说  我是  -别靠近我
- George, look. Honestly, I'm like... - Don't get close, Ira.

875
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:42,574
...很容易受骗的人  别这样对我
...a really gullible guy. Don't do this.

876
00:40:42,686 --> 00:40:44,017
我的朋友们总喜欢开我开玩笑
Look, my friends, they trick me all the time.

877
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:45,782
我的一个室友说他是乔・派西的儿子
One of my roommates told me he was Joe Pesci's son.

878
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:48,380
我信了他三年  我到现在还有心理阴影
I believed him for three years. I still get shit for it,

879
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:50,426
所以拜托跟我说实话
So just, please, level with me, man.

880
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:52,825
-你不是认真的吧  -我是认真的  艾拉
- Are you serious? - I am serious, Ira.

881
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:55,331
别把这件事告诉任何人行不
Don't tell anybody about this though, all right?

882
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:56,990
我希望这是我们之间的秘密
I want it to be our secret.

883
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,660
现在你能不能去给我做点鸡蛋  杀人凶手
Now, you're gonna make me some eggs. Okay, murderer?

884
00:41:00,203 --> 00:41:01,170
别这么叫我
Don't say that.

885
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:03,171
在我不在的时候
Just try not to kill any of the staff

886
00:41:03,273 --> 00:41:05,969
别杀了任何人  他们都有亲人
While I'm gone, okay? They have families.

887
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:08,301
一开始他的确是在开玩笑  后来他给我看
Well, he actually tricked me first, but then he showed...

888
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:09,605
我是说他的确在吃药
I mean, he's taking medicine.

889
00:41:09,713 --> 00:41:12,204
他从加拿大带回的特殊药品
He's getting this special medicine from Canada.

890
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:14,381
天哪  这是我听过最让人悲伤的事
Oh, my god, that's the saddest thing I've ever heard.

891
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:18,011
是啊  我觉得他只跟我说了这件事
Yeah. I think I'm the only person he's told.

892
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:18,971
他是这么说的  
That's what he said. 

893
00:41:19,201 --> 00:41:21,056
我想他真的挺喜欢我的
I mean, he's really... He likes me, in a weird...

894
00:41:21,224 --> 00:41:23,852
以一种怪异的方式喜欢我
I think he's, like, taken a shine to me, you know.

895
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,951
不至于喜欢到连这都说吧
Not enough to let you in on that two-on-one.

896
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:27,359
拜托  这可不是件好事啊
Come on, that's not appropriate.

897
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:28,897
其实我也不想这样
I don't want that anyway.

898
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:32,725
我只是想不通  我觉得...
I just don't know. I mean, it's...

899
00:41:32,836 --> 00:41:34,736
这还真有点吓人  我从没...
It's really scary. I've never even...

900
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:37,136
我从来没接触过什么生病的人
I don't think I've known anyone who's, like, sick,

901
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,708
那种病得很重的人  我只是...
You know, in like a major way before. I don't... I just...

902
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:42,642
乔治・西蒙斯  我从小听着他段子长大
George simmons. He's been around my whole life.

903
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:44,714
以后也许听不到了  你明白吗?
It's like snap, crackle and pop dying, you know?

904
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:45,781
我懂
I know.

905
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:47,474
我们现在能不能不要讨论这个
Can we not talk about this right now?

906
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:49,878
我受不了那些和死亡有关的事
I'm not really good with the whole death thing.

907
00:41:49,986 --> 00:41:51,317
行不
Is that all right?

908
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:53,753
我不得不说这个  兄弟  我为他工作
I need to talk about it, man. I work for this guy now.

909
00:41:53,857 --> 00:41:55,984
我做不到...  我..  我不停地在想这个
I can't... I mean, that's all I'm... It's all I'm thinking about.

910
00:41:56,092 --> 00:41:57,490
那我给你个故事吧  
I'm gonna tell you this story 

911
00:41:58,146 --> 00:42:00,000
它总让我觉得好过点
That makes me feel all right with death.

912
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:03,661
很小的时候我的祖父死了
When I was younger, my grandfather died

913
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:05,325
他死前我们都守在他的身边
And we were all gathered around him

914
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:08,632
他的床边放着一根蜡烛
And there was this one candle next to his bed.

915
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:10,214
就在他死了的时候
And right after he died,

916
00:42:10,214 --> 00:42:13,937
那蜡烛闪了下  然后就灭了
The candle started flickering and then it just went out.

917
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:15,435
-哇  -是真的
- Wow. - Yeah.  

918
00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:18,309
而且我们发现那房间里根本没有窗户
And we looked around, and there were no windows.

919
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:21,407
房间里什么都没有
Like, nothing in that room.

920
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:24,677
听起来很疯狂吧  但是我们都觉得
And it sounds crazy, but we all thought

921
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:27,120
那是因为他去了天堂
It was him going to heaven, you know?

922
00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:29,454
穿过火焰不可能是去了天堂啊
You don't pass through fire to get to heaven.

923
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:30,526
我想他是下地狱了
I think he went to hell.

924
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:33,286
- 你说什么?  - 我说...
- What'd you just say? - I just...

925
00:42:33,396 --> 00:42:35,091
我觉得你祖父应该是下地狱了
I think your grandfather probably went to hell.

926
00:42:35,198 --> 00:42:37,132
-别这这么说  -你是在和我开玩笑吗
- Don't do it. - Are you kidding me right now?

927
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:38,826
我...  我很抱歉让你伤心了
I'm... I'm sorry to break it to you.

928
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:40,061
当我和你们说这些的时候
You're gonna make fun of me right now,

929
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,195
你们居然还和我开这种玩笑?
Just after I opened up to you guys like that?

930
00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:44,000
你祖父去了地狱可不是我的错
It's not my fault your grandfather's in hell.

931
00:42:44,107 --> 00:42:45,089
这没什么大不了的  
It's not a big deal. 

932
00:42:45,090 --> 00:42:46,170
有不少人祖父去了地狱呢
Some grandpas go to hell.

933
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,749
靠  别这么混蛋
Come on. Don't be a jerk to me.

934
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:49,419
就因为我赚得比你们俩多
Just because I make more money than you guys.

935
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:50,496
你赚多少钱来着
How much do you make again?

936
00:42:51,932 --> 00:42:54,901
你们就这么讨厌我啊
You guys are just projecting all your hatred onto me.

937
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:56,400
别这么扫兴嘛
Okay, and don't be super bummed out

938
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:57,881
要知道现在你祖父正和
'cause your grandfather's playing backgammon 

939
00:42:58,115 --> 00:42:59,404
希特勒玩双陆棋呢
with Hitler right now.

940
00:42:59,506 --> 00:43:00,996
老兄  别这样
Shit, dude, don't.

941
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:06,338
我得把这些东西都扔了
I gotta get rid of this stuff.

942
00:43:07,614 --> 00:43:10,139
老兄  我真不知道该怎么处理它们
Man, I don't know what I'm gonna do with it.

943
00:43:11,184 --> 00:43:11,952
你赚的越多  
The more money you make, 

944
00:43:11,953 --> 00:43:13,709
得到免费的废物就越多
the more free shit they give you.

945
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,280
完全没用  又不能帮我在近期把到妹
It makes no sense. I don't see any jet skiing in my near future.

946
00:43:18,391 --> 00:43:20,052
这些东西全是免费的吗
All this shit was free?

947
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:23,068
艾拉  你想要个电视机吗
You want a TV, Ira?

948
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:22,985
我这里差不多有
I got, like, three flat screens 

949
00:43:23,237 --> 00:43:24,492
三个平板电视
Laying around in there somewhere.

950
00:43:24,598 --> 00:43:25,132
当然  我可以...
Sure, I can...

951
00:43:25,132 --> 00:43:27,761
我可以把这些东西都给你  或者...
Yeah, I can just take this stuff to goodwill if you want or...

952
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:30,597
好吧  别管这些东西了  我们...
You know what? Don't even worry about this stuff. Let's...

953
00:43:30,704 --> 00:43:33,104
你可以帮我把车库里的几辆车卖了
I got some cars in storage you could sell for me.

954
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:35,231
然后把钱都捐掉
And just give that money to charity.

955
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:36,309
我可以帮你
I can do that, yeah.

956
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:37,433
我要给你写一个单子
I'm gonna write a list out for you,

957
00:43:37,544 --> 00:43:39,478
告诉你我要处理的东西
Give you a bunch of things I want you to do.

958
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:40,705
你穿几码的鞋
What size sneaker are you?

959
00:43:40,814 --> 00:43:41,781
十一码半
Eleven and a half.

960
00:43:41,881 --> 00:43:44,975
你的小弟弟应该很粗壮吧  让我看看
You got that thick cock, don't you? I want to see that thing.

961
00:43:45,085 --> 00:43:46,780
来来来  让我看看
Come on, pull the cock out.

962
00:43:46,886 --> 00:43:47,875
我可不会拿给你看
I'm not gonna show it to you.

963
00:43:47,988 --> 00:43:48,955
你他妈是怎么了
What the fuck's the matter with you?

964
00:43:49,055 --> 00:43:50,283
我又不会对它做什么
I'm not gonna do anything with it.

965
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,255
我只是想知道我的对手长得啥样
I just want to know what I'm dealing with.

966
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:53,417
除非你给我一个iPod
If you give me an ipod.

967
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:54,823
你个混蛋
You asshole.

968
00:43:54,928 --> 00:43:56,361
好吧  这里的东西你可以随便拿
All right, you can have anything in here,

969
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:58,363
不过你必须得拿走这张游泳男的海报
But you gotta take the merman poster.

970
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:00,399
好啊  我想...  我爱游泳男
No, I want... I love merman!

971
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,797
我就知道你喜欢
I knew you loved merman.

972
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:03,835
你和五岁的孩子都喜欢游泳男
You and five-year-olds love merman.

973
00:44:04,504 --> 00:44:05,698
这是部不错的电影
It's a smart movie.

974
00:44:07,674 --> 00:44:10,521
呃  到底哪些车属于
So, which, specifically, of the cars 

975
00:44:10,770 --> 00:44:12,134
乔治・西蒙斯
Belong to George Simmons?

976
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:14,303
-哪一辆  -嗯
- Which one? - Yeah.

977
00:44:14,414 --> 00:44:15,608
全是他的
All of them.

978
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:17,413
-全是他的吗  -没错
- All of them? - Yeah.

979
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:18,882
呃...
Well...

980
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:21,387
那我要怎么卖啊
How would I go about selling?

981
00:44:22,322 --> 00:44:23,880
-卖车  -是啊
- Selling them? - Yeah.

982
00:44:24,324 --> 00:44:25,552
我不知道怎么卖  
Well, I don't know about selling them 

983
00:44:25,553 --> 00:44:27,054
但是我能让一小部分消失
but I can make a few disappear.

984
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,491
你懂我的意思吧
You know what I'm saying?

985
00:44:29,462 --> 00:44:30,793
我可不想那样做
I don't want to do that.

986
00:44:30,897 --> 00:44:32,865
我也不想
I don't want to do that, either.

987
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:34,532
开个玩笑罢了
Just kidding.

988
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,604
第四幕准备  铃声准备  《无厘头课堂》
Scene D is up! Let's go on a bell. Yo Teach...!

989
00:44:44,811 --> 00:44:46,005
开拍
And action!

990
00:44:46,112 --> 00:44:48,012

All right now... Bradford!

991
00:44:48,114 --> 00:44:49,741
嗯  啥事儿
Yeah? What is this?

992
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:53,030
波的英语考试卷
Bo's English test.

993
00:44:53,135 --> 00:44:54,466
你弄错了吧
Well, there's a mistake.

994
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:57,065
的确  他错了很多
Well, yeah, there are lots of mistakes.

995
00:44:57,172 --> 00:44:58,799
也就是为什么他得了一个F
That's why there's an F on it.

996
00:44:58,908 --> 00:45:01,003
你知道  如果波考试没过关
You know, if Bo doesn't pass, 

997
00:45:01,004 --> 00:45:02,400
他就不能参加周五的球赛了
he can't play in the big game Friday.

998
00:45:02,511 --> 00:45:04,138
要么让他通过
Either you make this right,

999
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:05,766
要么你今年夏天就得去
Or you'll be spending the summer 

1000
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:09,081
驾校当老师咯  叭叭
Teaching driver's ED. Honk, honk!

1001
00:45:10,386 --> 00:45:11,614
什么东西
Shit.

1002
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,017
我受不了了  我...
I can't be a part of this. I'm not...

1003
00:45:13,122 --> 00:45:14,350
我要走了
Yeah. I'm gonna go.

1004
00:45:15,758 --> 00:45:17,282
这真是太煎熬了
This is just so painful, though, isn't it?

1005
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:19,691
的确  我真想自杀了
Yes, I want to kill myself.

1006
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:21,759
你是哪里人  
So, where are you from, originally? 

1007
00:45:21,686 --> 00:45:23,030
你应该是刚搬来的吧
You just moved here, right?

1008
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:24,859
没错  特拉华州
Yep. Delaware.

1009
00:45:24,967 --> 00:45:27,868
特拉华  美国的第一个州
Delaware! Our first state in the union.

1010
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,437
没错
Yes, it is.

1011
00:45:29,738 --> 00:45:31,865
真棒  你们州不用交销售税是吧
That's great. No sales tax in Delaware, right?

1012
00:45:31,974 --> 00:45:33,635
嗯哼  是的  真奇怪
Yeah, there's not. That's weird.

1013
00:45:33,742 --> 00:45:35,642
你怎么知道这么多关于特拉华州的事
You know so much about Delaware.

1014
00:45:35,744 --> 00:45:37,336
你该不会是上了乔・拜登吧
You fucking Joe Biden?

1015
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:39,414
我知道他是从特拉华州来的
He's from Delaware. See? I knew that.

1016
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:42,848
波  你是个聪明的孩子  你已经受到惩罚了
Bo, you're a smart kid. I've seen you rap.

1017
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:44,078
-耶!  -好吧
- Yeah! - All right?

1018
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:46,677
我给你一个补考的机会怎么样
Now, I am willing to give you a makeup exam on this, all right?

1019
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:48,051
你喜欢音乐吗
Do you like music?

1020
00:45:48,157 --> 00:45:49,419
你刚才是不是问我喜不喜欢音乐
Did you just ask me if I liked music?

1021
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:52,289
是的  呃  我发现这个问题很怪异
Yeah. That... I'm... I'm aware that that's a weird question.

1022
00:45:52,394 --> 00:45:54,157
就像问我喜不喜欢食物一样
It's like asking me if I like food.

1023
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:56,254
我本来正打算问呢
That was my next question.

1024
00:45:56,498 --> 00:45:57,863
-我喜欢音乐  -很好
- Yes. - Good.

1025
00:45:57,967 --> 00:46:01,562
你喜欢威尔科吗  在希腊剧院表演的那个
Wilco. do you like Wilco? Wilco's playing at the Greek theatre.

1026
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,138
我想问你愿不愿意和我一起去
And I was just wondering if you maybe wanted to go with me.

1027
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,503
好啊  我会去的  我挺喜欢威尔科
Yeah. I'll go. I'd be into that. I like wilco.

1028
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:07,598
太好了
Great.

1029
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:08,735
很好很好  
Okay, great, great. So, 

1030
00:46:09,742 --> 00:46:12,238
我想那我们要一起去看那演出了
I guess we will go to the show together.

1031
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:13,612
那我不去了
Not anymore.

1032
00:46:14,717 --> 00:46:15,945
你说真的吗
You serious?

1033
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:18,514
-没有  我会去的  -哦  好的
- No, I'll go. - Oh, okay. Thank you.

1034
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:19,610
你可别再那么说了
Just don't say that ever again.

1035
00:46:19,722 --> 00:46:20,689
我不会了
Okay. I won't.

1036
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:22,279
-老师  -嗯
- Yo, teach! - Yeah?

1037
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,417
多谢了
Thanks.

1038
00:46:25,027 --> 00:46:25,994
话真多
Word.

1039
00:46:26,595 --> 00:46:29,628
哆来咪  Wiener
Do-ra-mi, Wiener

1040
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:32,661
哆来咪  烤肠
Do-ra-mi, Wiener

1041
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:36,329
我是维纳
My name is Wiener

1042
00:46:36,939 --> 00:46:40,033
我是维纳  我是维纳
My name is Wiener my name is Wiener

1043
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:41,837
别叫我烤肠
Don't call me Wiener

1044
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:45,510
算了  写了什么笑话给我吗
Whatever. You got any jokes for me, dum-dum?

1045
00:46:45,614 --> 00:46:47,673
我有些好的点子
Got some good ones, I think, actually.

1046
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,542
比如说你很有钱
I have a thing about how, like, you're rich, you know,

1047
00:46:51,654 --> 00:46:52,780
然后你买了个私人飞机
And so you bought a private jet,

1048
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:54,048
但你很害怕飞行
But you're afraid of flying,

1049
00:46:54,156 --> 00:46:55,123
所以你只是在地上开开
So you just drive in it.

1050
00:46:55,224 --> 00:46:56,418
听起来挺有趣的
Oh, that's funny.

1051
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,857
你也只是开到洗车场洗飞机而已
You just go to drive-throughs and car washes.

1052
00:46:58,961 --> 00:46:59,848
嗯  不错  
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

1053
00:46:59,849 --> 00:47:01,623
我自己构思结尾吧  开头不错
I'll come up with the ending, but that was good.

1054
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:04,011
我想了个关于
I thought it could be funny about 

1055
00:47:04,012 --> 00:47:05,792
你蛋蛋的笑话  例如
Your balls, you know, about how, like,

1056
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:07,347
你越来越老了  某天发现
You're getting older and you found 

1057
00:47:07,348 --> 00:47:09,337
你蛋蛋上的毛变灰了
The first gray hair on your balls.

1058
00:47:09,438 --> 00:47:10,287
开始你很担心  
And it really worried you, 

1059
00:47:10,288 --> 00:47:11,668
但是后来你发现这也还不错
but then you realized it was good

1060
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:14,140
因为它让你的蛋蛋与众不同又漂亮
'cause it made your balls look distinguished and smart.

1061
00:47:14,406 --> 00:47:15,949
像是给你的蛋蛋穿了件
Like, if you gave your balls a little tweed

1062
00:47:15,949 --> 00:47:17,701
有护肘和小管子的粗花呢子夹克
Jacket with elbow pads and a little pipe,

1063
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:19,094
你的蛋蛋就会像
Your balls could be like a character 

1064
00:47:19,095 --> 00:47:21,943
凯文・克莱恩在电影里演的一样
kevin kline would play in a movie.

1065
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:25,043
这个不错  很有趣  我可以用它
Yeah, that's funny, that's funny. I could do that.

1066
00:47:25,154 --> 00:47:26,178
还有其他点子吗
What else you got?

1067
00:47:26,288 --> 00:47:29,917
还有一件事我刚刚弄好
Actually, this just kind of happened.

1068
00:47:30,993 --> 00:47:33,427
我在itunes(播放器)里帮你建了个播放列表
I'm making you an itunes playlist.

1069
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:35,463
-这是干啥  -当我情绪不好的时候
- For what? - Sometimes, when I'm upset,

1070
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:39,000
音乐总能让我好起来  所以我想...
Music makes me feel a little better, so I thought maybe...

1071
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:40,625
那东西能让我振奋吗
Oh, it's a cheer-me-up thing?

1072
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:41,896
我正要把它放到你的ipod里去
I was gonna just put it on your ipod.

1073
00:47:42,004 --> 00:47:43,266
不过我想不用现在就放吧
I don't have to play it right now.

1074
00:47:43,372 --> 00:47:45,203
干嘛  让我慢跑的时候听吗  我不需要...
For what? For when I go out jogging? I don't need to...

1075
00:47:45,307 --> 00:47:48,936
还是让我听听看吧  我现在不跑步了  听听看
Let me hear it. I don't jog anymore. Let me hear my playlist.

1076
00:47:57,252 --> 00:48:00,312
艾拉  艾拉
Ira! Ira!

1077
00:48:01,323 --> 00:48:03,154
好吧  你没必要嘲笑这歌
Okay, you don't have to make fun of it.

1078
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:05,021
天哪  鲍勃・马利的歌
No, Bob Marley!

1079
00:48:05,127 --> 00:48:08,824
是的  事情都会好起来的  你说的没错艾拉
Yes. Everything is gonna be all right. You're right, Ira.

1080
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:10,948
鲍勃・马利得了癌症  
Bob Marley had cancer. 

1081
00:48:10,949 --> 00:48:11,957
但是他可没好起来
Everything wasn't all right for Bob Marley.

1082
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:13,398
他现在死了
He dead now.

1083
00:48:13,502 --> 00:48:14,935
你还放了什么歌
What else you put on there for me?

1084
00:48:15,037 --> 00:48:16,436
我不想放下去了  乔治
I really don't want to do this, George.

1085
00:48:16,538 --> 00:48:17,971
我们能不能就...  当我没做吧
Can we just... I'll... just forget I did this.

1086
00:48:18,073 --> 00:48:19,472
忽略它  我会它们都删了
Ignore it. I'll erase it, okay?

1087
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:20,860
不不不  不用这样
No, no, no, don't do that.

1088
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,499
听听还有什么能让我振作起来的歌  
Let's hear what's gonna cheer me up! 

1089
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:23,534
这样好
This is good.

1090
00:48:23,645 --> 00:48:25,135
来来来  你还放了什么
Come on. What else you got?

1091
00:48:25,247 --> 00:48:26,578
好吧  这是下一首
Okay, here's the next one.

1092
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:33,245
如今的我人生得意
Now I've had the time of my life

1093
00:48:33,355 --> 00:48:36,153
从未有过的感觉
No, I never felt like this before

1094
00:48:36,258 --> 00:48:37,657
我不知道该说什么了
I don't know what to say to that one.

1095
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,355
这首歌被我归为第五等
That's... That's just... That's just fifth grade and...

1096
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,899
给我看你小弟弟都那么尴尬  放这歌就不会吗
Showing me your cock was embarrassing, but this is okay?

1097
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,797
天哪  这是个很棒的歌
Oh, god. That's a good song.

1098
00:48:46,902 --> 00:48:50,065
好吧  还有什么  听听看  真不敢相信
Yeah, what else? Give me more. This is... This is unbelievable.

1099
00:48:50,172 --> 00:48:51,867
你确定你想听下一首
You sure you want to hear another one?

1100
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:52,963
-我可不想...  -当然当然
- I don't... - Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

1101
00:48:53,075 --> 00:48:55,043
被振奋对我来说很有趣
This is fun to be cheered up.

1102
00:48:55,144 --> 00:48:56,133
我很抱歉...
I'm sorry...

1103
00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:05,685
黑暗降临  我快要窒息
Shadows are falling and I'm running out of breath

1104
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:09,791
让我在你心里多停留几许
Keep me in your heart for a while

1105
00:49:11,593 --> 00:49:16,360
如果我离开你  不代表我对你的爱减少
If I leave you, it doesn't mean I love you any less

1106
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:20,693
让我在你心里多停留几许
Keep me in your heart for a while

1107
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:27,399
清晨醒来  你看见灿烂的太阳
When you get up in the morning and you see that crazy sun

1108
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:31,402
让我在你心里多停留几许
Keep me in your heart for a while

1109
00:49:33,382 --> 00:49:36,317
你只要多写些段子就行了  你个傻瓜
Just write me some jokes, you stupid, fucking idiot.

1110
00:49:36,418 --> 00:49:37,976
好吧  对不起
Okay, I'm sorry.

1111
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:42,180
让我在你心里多停留几许
Keep me in your heart for a while

1112
00:49:43,425 --> 00:49:45,791
我没结过婚  我从不觉得我会结婚
So, I'm not married. I don't think I'm ever gonna get married.

1113
00:49:45,894 --> 00:49:47,919
我觉得没什么理由这么做
I just... I can't find a reason to do it, you know?

1114
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,429
比方说  我有一个朋友
Like, I got friends, like,

1115
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:51,328
"你结婚了  我的老婆
"You gotta get married. My wife.

1116
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,331
"她是世界上最好的厨师
"My wife is a... She's the best cook.

1117
00:49:53,435 --> 00:49:54,663
"我的老婆是...  你知道的"
"My wife's the... You gotta. "

1118
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,136
在我看来是"我的厨师是最好的厨师"
And I'm like, "My cook's the best cook. "

1119
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:01,533
"但我老婆  她是我最好的朋友"
"But my wife, she's my best friend. "

1120
00:50:02,411 --> 00:50:04,709
"事实上  我的厨师是个很好的男人"
"Yeah, my cook's actually a pretty good guy. " You know?

1121
00:50:05,647 --> 00:50:07,478
这个挺有趣的
This could be funny.

1122
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:09,314
比方说  你老爸不喜欢你  
Like, your dad didn't like you, 

1123
00:50:09,315 --> 00:50:11,417
所以把你和狗狗都取名为乔治
so he named you and your dog George.

1124
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,511
他会说  "过来乔治
He'd be like, "Hey, George, come in here!

1125
00:50:13,922 --> 00:50:15,617
"没说你  是狗狗"
"not you, the dog. "

1126
00:50:16,158 --> 00:50:18,524
"乔治  看看我刚拿到的好书"
"George, I... look at this awesome book I just got!"

1127
00:50:18,627 --> 00:50:20,117
然后你走过去  他说"没说你  是狗狗"
And then you come in, it's like, "Not you, the dog. "

1128
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:21,218
很有趣哈
That's funny. Yeah.

1129
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,387
"嗨  乔治  我给你煎了块牛排"  
"hey, George, I made a nice steak for you." 

1130
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:23,924
"谢谢老爸"
"Hey, thanks, dad. "

1131
00:50:24,032 --> 00:50:25,966
"没说你  是狗狗"
"Not you, the dog. "

1132
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:28,723
"嗨  乔治  我刚在小弟弟上涂了花生酱  
"Hey, George, I just put some peanut butter on my balls. 

1133
00:50:28,723 --> 00:50:29,591
过来舔舔
Come lick it up.

1134
00:50:29,591 --> 00:50:31,105
说你呢"
You. "

1135
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:33,825
他妈的
Fuck him.

1136
00:50:33,926 --> 00:50:37,928
我坚信隔山打牛是我的人生理念
I miss the dry hump as a concept in my life. 

1137
00:50:37,929 --> 00:50:39,262
这只是...
It just doesn't...

1138
00:50:39,365 --> 00:50:41,158
我喜欢隔山打牛
I miss the dry hump 'cause you don't

1139
00:50:41,158 --> 00:50:43,199
因为鸡鸡不大也能做的很棒
Need a big dick to be a good dry humper.

1140
00:50:43,302 --> 00:50:46,294
但你得有强健的大腿
You just need a big thigh, that's all you need.

1141
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:49,340
能灵活地上上下下
Be able to get your thigh in there real good.

1142
00:50:49,441 --> 00:50:52,308
我能用大腿让姑娘们爽死
I can thigh the hell out of a girl.

1143
00:50:52,411 --> 00:50:56,507
说到性交  我糟透了  但我可以一整天都这样
Sexually, I'm completely terrible, but I could do this all day.

1144
00:50:57,216 --> 00:50:58,862
顺便说一句  我很有钱
I'm very rich, by the way.

1145
00:50:58,862 --> 00:51:02,153
这一定让你们觉得自己过的不错
I know that makes you feel good about your life.

1146
00:51:02,254 --> 00:51:03,414
我听到过很多这种话
I got so much.

1147
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:06,150
"你拥有的太多了  我怎么什么都没有"
"you have so much. why not me?"

1148
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:08,988
有时候我走在街上  就有人拦着我说
I have people stop me on the streets sometimes, just go,

1149
00:51:09,094 --> 00:51:13,190
"你拥有的太多了"  是是是  "我怎么什么都没有"
"you have so much!" "yes, yes. " "why not me?"

1150
00:51:13,298 --> 00:51:14,265
我就说  我也不知道
Like, "I don't know. "

1151
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:19,133
"凭什么  我来到这儿做你做过的事"
"why you? I came out here to do what you do. "

1152
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:20,205
"你可没有"
"well, you're not doing it. "

1153
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:22,136
"没错  我没有"
"no, I'm not!

1154
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:26,075
"去你妈的  我想要你的钱和马子"
"fuck you! I want all your money and all your whores. "

1155
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:29,203
飞机是唯一你可以尽情放响屁
Airplanes are the last public place

1156
00:51:29,314 --> 00:51:31,782
又不被人鄙视的公共场所
Where you can fart as loud as you want and no one cares.

1157
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:34,151
因为他们听不见  引擎的噪声很大
'cause they don't... it's loud. there's engine noise.

1158
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:35,242
他们不会知道是你干的
They just don't know it's you.

1159
00:51:35,354 --> 00:51:37,982
你可以和刚认识的人谈话
Like, you could literally be talking to someone you just met

1160
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,955
离他只有这么远
And be sitting this far away from them

1161
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:41,338
死盯着他们的眼睛  
And look them dead in the eye 

1162
00:51:41,339 --> 00:51:42,618
听他们讲自己的孙子
As they talk about their grandson

1163
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:45,595
同时鼓足全力放一个全人类最响的屁
And just fart as loud as you humanly can. just...

1164
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:49,299
"是吗  你的孙子住在哪儿"
"yeah? where's your grandson from?"

1165
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:52,131
与此同时我一直在放屁  一直一直
My asshole's been open this whole time. it's just still...

1166
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:56,770
等会我送你回去的时候
Hey, can you help me with some of my jokes when I...

1167
00:51:56,770 --> 00:51:58,105
你能帮我完成几个段子吗
When I drop you off later?

1168
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:59,609
帮你弄几个段子吗
Help you with some of your bits? 

1169
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:01,645
不行  我可不帮你
No. I'm not gonna help you, man.

1170
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:04,147
我开始的时候可没人帮我
No one helped me when I started.

1171
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:05,920
该死的  我不是花钱来帮你的  
Fucking, I'm not paying to help you, 

1172
00:52:05,921 --> 00:52:06,547
我让你来帮我
I'm paying you to help me.

1173
00:52:06,652 --> 00:52:08,517
不不  没关系  你说的对
No, okay. you're right, you're right.

1174
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:10,890
一直以来都有一个姑娘  
There is always the one girl out there, though. 

1175
00:52:10,891 --> 00:52:12,215
那个离开的姑娘
The one that got away.

1176
00:52:12,324 --> 00:52:15,420
男人和杀人狂心里都想着
Guys have that and serial killers have that. 

1177
00:52:15,421 --> 00:52:17,227
那个离开的姑娘
The one that got away.

1178
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:22,494
"我得到她了  鸡鸡都用垃圾袋装好了"
"I had her, the trunk was lined with garbage bags

1179
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:24,501
"然后她离开"
"and then she got away. "

1180
00:52:26,472 --> 00:52:28,872
我讨厌按照说唱乐里说的做
I'm sick of rap songs telling me what to do.

1181
00:52:30,242 --> 00:52:33,541
"弯下腰拍拍屁股  把它像烫手山芋一样丢掉"
"bend over. slap your ass, girl. drop it like it's hot. "

1182
00:52:35,264 --> 00:52:36,390
我也要写首歌反击
Yeah, I'm gonna write a song back.

1183
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:40,901
比如  "小子  刷刷牙去"
I'm gonna be, like, "boy, brush your teeth!

1184
00:52:41,002 --> 00:52:43,844
"把衣服扒下来  
"yeah, boy, bump that jacket off your back. 

1185
00:52:43,845 --> 00:52:46,372
我TM要冻死了"
I'm fucking cold as shit!"

1186
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:49,174
我打飞机的时候挤的手霜太多了
I masturbate so much with hand cream,

1187
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:52,872
我有时会忘了人们也用它干别的
I forget people use it for shit other than masturbating.

1188
00:52:52,981 --> 00:52:54,200
真的  当我看到有人
Literally, when I'm in public and 

1189
00:52:54,201 --> 00:52:55,176
当众把手霜拿出来
I see someone pull out hand cream,

1190
00:52:55,283 --> 00:52:58,013
我还想  "这人要打飞机了"
I'm like, "this guy's about to jerk off!"

1191
00:52:58,219 --> 00:52:59,243
我想问问你
Can I ask you something?

1192
00:52:59,354 --> 00:53:01,416
你的表演是为了确保
Is your act just designed to make sure

1193
00:53:01,416 --> 00:53:03,586
不会有姑娘想和你上床吗
No girl will ever sleep with you again?

1194
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:06,888
你说的都是手淫和放屁的事
All you fucking talk about is jacking off and farting.

1195
00:53:06,995 --> 00:53:08,690
你觉得表演之后会有姑娘来找你
You think a girl's gonna come up to you after the show,

1196
00:53:09,097 --> 00:53:11,964
跟你说"你能帮我手淫  在我脸上放个屁吗"
"could you just jack off for me and then fart in my face?"

1197
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,968
真有病  你就没想过和人上床吗
It's fucking insane! Do you want to get laid, ever?

1198
00:53:24,612 --> 00:53:29,515
没了我你们该怎么生活
How will you people live without me?

1199
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:35,785
没了我谁给你们带来欢乐
Who will bring you joy when I'm gone?

1200
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:41,752
因为我是个滑稽的人
'cause I'm one funny man

1201
00:53:42,063 --> 00:53:45,191
我带来滑稽喜剧
I bring the comedy

1202
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,067
我能让你开心
I am the one you go to, to get cheered up

1203
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,937
恰如我演过的电影
Put in my movies

1204
00:53:56,044 --> 00:54:02,176
逃亡吧  到爱与美之岛
Escape, if you will to a land of loveliness

1205
00:54:05,186 --> 00:54:08,155
他没有耐心
He doesn't have patience

1206
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:14,684
他痛恨所有的人  他常嫉妒得发狂
He hates so many people he's mad when others do well

1207
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:21,266
他也痛恨他自己  该死的乔治・西蒙斯
He hates himself fuck George Simmons

1208
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:24,900
他的小弟弟只是中等型号
He has a medium-sized penis

1209
00:54:25,006 --> 00:54:29,875
他睡了很多姑娘  她们都不记得
He fucked so many girls and yet no one remembers

1210
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:33,439
等他干完了
When he's done fucking them

1211
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:37,082
姑娘只是躺在那儿说
The girl just lays there and says

1212
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:42,088
我应该去陪尚格・云顿睡而不是你
I should have fucked Jean-Claude Van Damme instead of you

1213
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:48,087
他妈的  真他妈的
Fuck, yeah! fuck, yeah!

1214
00:54:49,764 --> 00:54:54,224
乔治・西蒙斯很快就要离开
George Simmons soon will be gone

1215
00:54:57,338 --> 00:55:00,603
他才不会想念你们
And he will not miss you people at all.

1216
00:55:02,076 --> 00:55:05,534
我们的关系一直都很尴尬
Our relationship has always been strained.

1217
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:08,643
你索取得太多  
You always wanted too much from me, 

1218
00:55:08,644 --> 00:55:10,516
我都要疯了
And I'm very mad at you.

1219
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:15,913
离我远点  你们这群基佬也别来祭奠
Leave me alone. don't visit my grave, cocksuckers.

1220
00:55:17,492 --> 00:55:18,618
终得宁静
Peace!

1221
00:55:32,574 --> 00:55:34,041
天啊  是乔治・西蒙斯
Oh, my god, it's George Simmons!

1222
00:55:34,943 --> 00:55:37,468
你怎么在这儿  怎么了
What are you doing here? What's happening?

1223
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:39,463
我睡不着  我想看骑士队的比赛
I couldn't sleep. I want to get the Cavaliers game.

1224
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:43,041
我一直都不会用这个
I can't get this thing ever to work.

1225
00:55:43,151 --> 00:55:45,760
我整晚都醒着  我的睡眠很糟
I was up all night, man. I had a terrible sleep.

1226
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:47,315
不停地冒虚汗
I was sweating my ass off.

1227
00:55:47,422 --> 00:55:49,890
忽冷忽热
I'm fucking hot one second and cold one second

1228
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:52,858
自动调温装置还不管用
And the ALC don't work for shit.

1229
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:55,987
总是热得不行
It's always going up to the roof.

1230
00:55:56,097 --> 00:55:57,291
几点了
What time is it?

1231
00:55:57,398 --> 00:55:58,888
3点
It says 3:00.

1232
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:04,330
3点了  妈的  我可不能浪费时间
It's 3:00? God damn it! I can't fucking waste time. I gotta...

1233
00:56:06,641 --> 00:56:09,132
好了  开始我讨厌的一天
All right, let's start my goddamn day.

1234
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:11,544
我可没时间弄这个狗屁玩意
I don't got time for this shit.

1235
00:56:11,646 --> 00:56:14,240
把那个破遥控器给我  快
Let me have that stupid clicker. come on.

1236
00:56:16,784 --> 00:56:18,979
他们总要我给分机打电话
They keep telling me that I gotta dial an extension.

1237
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:21,134
我TM压根就不知道
I don't even have the fucking number 

1238
00:56:21,135 --> 00:56:22,955
那个鬼分机的号码
To dial for the fucking extension!

1239
00:56:23,057 --> 00:56:24,081
你想让我来打电话吗
Do you want me to try calling them?

1240
00:56:24,325 --> 00:56:25,792
你TM是该打电话
You should have fucking called them!

1241
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:28,123
你昨晚死哪儿去了
Where the fuck were you last night?

1242
00:56:28,496 --> 00:56:29,520
你给他们打电话
You'll call them.

1243
00:56:29,631 --> 00:56:31,030
真抱歉哥们
I'm sorry, man.

1244
00:56:31,132 --> 00:56:32,793
告诉我你想要什么  我给你弄
Just tell me what you need, I'll get it done, okay?

1245
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,960
我付钱给你装这个  可它根本不能用
You pay for all of this stuff and none of it ever works!

1246
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,937
全不好使  我甚至觉得我没病
Nothing! I don't even think I'm sick!

1247
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,873
是这些人想要杀了我
These guys are trying to fucking kill me!

1248
00:56:42,644 --> 00:56:45,875
我要去见医生  会会那个家伙
I want to go to the doctor. I gotta see this guy.

1249
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,346
到底怎么了
What the fuck is happening?

1250
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:53,184
药不但不管用  反而更糟了
This medicine does not work. It makes it worse!

1251
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,381
我现在就打给他们  告诉他们你要过去
Okay. I'll call them right now. I'll tell them we're coming, okay?

1252
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:57,082
现在就去  现在
Now. we gotta go now.

1253
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:58,283
我马上打电话
I'll call them right now, okay?

1254
00:56:58,393 --> 00:57:00,293
我在楼下等你
Yeah. I'll meet you downstairs.

1255
00:57:08,936 --> 00:57:13,498
把游戏收起来  别这样  太没礼貌了
Please put away the video game. don't do that. don't be rude.

1256
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:14,575
对不起
I'm sorry.

1257
00:57:14,676 --> 00:57:15,643
贪食蛇吗
Fucking playing centipede?

1258
00:57:15,743 --> 00:57:17,074
你玩什么呢
What the fuck were you playing?

1259
00:57:17,178 --> 00:57:18,941
赛车游戏
Just a driving game.

1260
00:57:20,581 --> 00:57:21,570
你好  西蒙斯先生
Hello, Mr. Simmons.

1261
00:57:21,683 --> 00:57:22,650
很高兴见到你  医生
Hey, yeah, doctor, good to see you.

1262
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,808
你还好吧  我带了我的朋友来
How are you? I brought my friend.

1263
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:28,048
他是我的  情人  人生伴侣  我的全部
This is my... well, my lover, my life partner, my everything.

1264
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:30,681
你还好吧  怎么样了  我们要干嘛
How are you? What's going on? How we doing?

1265
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:32,513
你的免疫系统正在打
Well, your immune system is 

1266
00:57:32,514 --> 00:57:33,852
一场艰难的战役
In the middle of a very serious battle.

1267
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:36,294
药物正在与疾病搏斗
The medicine is trying to combat the disease,

1268
00:57:36,397 --> 00:57:38,797
但这会毁掉健康的组织
But in the process it destroys healthy tissue

1269
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,198
并且会扰乱
And disrupts healthy functioning of your organs

1270
00:57:41,302 --> 00:57:43,770
身体器官和淋巴系统的健康功能
And multiple lymphatic systems,

1271
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:45,998
你正在承受双重攻击
So you're getting attacked on two levels.

1272
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:48,275
只希望在你健康器官被药物
And we hope the disease is vanquished

1273
00:57:48,376 --> 00:57:49,938
摧残之前能够
Before it and the medicine does damage 

1274
00:57:49,939 --> 00:57:51,277
消灭疾病
Which cannot be contained.

1275
00:57:51,713 --> 00:57:53,305
好吧
Okay.

1276
00:57:53,414 --> 00:57:55,041
你口音很重
Your accent is very thick.

1277
00:57:56,584 --> 00:57:57,881
你没觉得你的口音
You ever notice your accent

1278
00:57:57,985 --> 00:58:01,512
会让事情听起来更糟吗
Makes things sound worse than they... than they actually are?

1279
00:58:02,023 --> 00:58:04,218
你可以说点好消息  我还能装着说
You could give good news, and I'd still be like,

1280
00:58:04,325 --> 00:58:06,020
"怎么了  我还会死吗"
"what happened? Am I still dying?"

1281
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,394
我只是想帮你
I'm just trying to help you.

1282
00:58:08,796 --> 00:58:11,094
虽然听上去你像是个普通人
I know you sound like a regular Joe where you come from,

1283
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:13,052
但我总觉得你
But here I keep thinking 

1284
00:58:13,053 --> 00:58:17,069
接下来就要拷问詹姆斯・邦德
You're gonna be torturing James Bond later.

1285
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:19,007
我觉得你的幽默感
I'm sure your sense of humor 

1286
00:58:19,008 --> 00:58:21,073
能帮你渡过这个难关
Will serve you well in this situation.

1287
00:58:21,476 --> 00:58:22,752
又来了  
There he goes again. 

1288
00:58:22,753 --> 00:58:26,072
一从你嘴里说出来就那么吓人
All so terrifying because it came out of your mouth.

1289
00:58:26,581 --> 00:58:28,412
你真是个滑稽的人
You are a very funny man.

1290
00:58:28,516 --> 00:58:30,780
你讨厌痛苦的死去吗
Are you mad that you died at the end of die hard?

1291
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:33,653
我没明白你指代什么
I don't understand the reference.

1292
00:58:35,123 --> 00:58:36,203
他像是《黑客帝国二》
He kind of looks like those two guys 

1293
00:58:36,204 --> 00:58:37,284
里面的那两个家伙
In the Second Matrix movie.

1294
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:41,020
我向你保证我没演《黑客帝国》
I assure you I was not in the Matrix.

1295
00:58:41,129 --> 00:58:44,155
你为什么不演了  他把你怎么了
Why did you be on board? What did he do to you?

1296
00:58:44,265 --> 00:58:48,031
你没别的问题了吧  我还有别的病人
If you have no other questions, I do have other patients.

1297
00:58:48,136 --> 00:58:50,432
今天你还有别的病人
You have other patients that 

1298
00:58:50,433 --> 00:58:52,072
要去吓唬吗
You have to frighten by the end of the day?

1299
00:58:52,173 --> 00:58:53,640
你每天吓唬多少个病人
How many patients do you frighten a day?

1300
00:58:53,741 --> 00:58:56,608
我对你们的搞笑行为
And I am slowly getting a little bit annoyed

1301
00:58:56,711 --> 00:59:00,408
开始觉得厌烦了
By these humorous activities from you guys.

1302
00:59:01,215 --> 00:59:02,182
所以我想
So, I think you and...

1303
00:59:02,283 --> 00:59:03,807
我们已经讨论过了
We have discussed this and I am very,

1304
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:06,352
我非常同情你的恢复状况
Very sympathetic to your recovery,

1305
00:59:06,587 --> 00:59:09,988
我希望你能成功康复
And I hope we will succeed with what we are doing.

1306
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:12,616
我这六个月来一直想
I've been trying to build this cabinet I bought from you guys

1307
00:59:12,727 --> 00:59:14,888
给你俩组装好那个衣柜
For, like, six months and I gotta...

1308
00:59:14,996 --> 00:59:16,861
宜家的吗  真搞笑
Ikea? that's very funny.

1309
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:29,175
-嗨  滑稽老师  -嗨
- Hey. yo, teach. - Hey.

1310
00:59:30,978 --> 00:59:32,673
录音怎么样了
How's... how was the taping?

1311
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,544
不错  很不错  我很开心
Great. great, yeah. I'm happy with it.

1312
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,242
我觉得那结尾很赞
I think the ending really murdered.

1313
00:59:37,351 --> 00:59:40,149
那是个特别选辑吗
Was it a very special episode?

1314
00:59:41,856 --> 00:59:44,290
你认识黛西吧
You remember Daisy, right?

1315
00:59:44,392 --> 00:59:45,620
当然了
Yeah, of course.

1316
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:47,151
你好
Hey.

1317
00:59:47,261 --> 00:59:48,523
真抱歉
I'm sorry.

1318
00:59:48,629 --> 00:59:50,256
我不知道你今天晚上要回来
I didn't know you'd be coming home tonight.

1319
00:59:50,364 --> 00:59:51,375
我以为你会在
I thought maybe you'd be spending 

1320
00:59:51,376 --> 00:59:53,060
乔治那儿过夜
The night at George's and...

1321
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:57,103
已经过了10天了吧
Guess it's been more than 10 days, huh?

1322
00:59:57,205 --> 01:00:00,766
是啊  其实我给了你11天
Yeah, I gave you an extra 11.

1323
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,001
你们在说什么
What are you guys talking about?

1324
01:00:02,109 --> 01:00:03,940
没什么的  都是小事  很好
Nothing. Doesn't matter. It's cool.

1325
01:00:04,045 --> 01:00:06,206
没事的  都很好
Don't give a shit. totally fine.

1326
01:00:11,118 --> 01:00:13,313
我看了新出的《哈利・波特》
Hey. I saw the new Harry Potter movie.

1327
01:00:15,022 --> 01:00:16,011
哈利变得老成了
Harry's getting old.

1328
01:00:16,123 --> 01:00:17,090
比我爸爸还老
He's, like, older than my dad.

1329
01:00:17,191 --> 01:00:18,658
应该叫他哈罗德・波特了
They should call him Harold Potter.

1330
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:21,620
赫敏的胸很大了
That Hermione's got some big, old titties.

1331
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:26,727
怎么了
Whoa!

1332
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:30,770
你俩刚刚嘿咻了吧  我也有点性奋了
Did you two just bone? I'm getting a little vibe here.

1333
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:33,773
真不错  我好像已经开始立了
This is exciting. Think I'm getting a quarter chub.

1334
01:00:35,376 --> 01:00:36,707
为什么艾拉那么心烦的样子
Why is Ira so upset?

1335
01:00:36,811 --> 01:00:39,177
早已经过了10天了吧
It's been, like, way after 10 days.

1336
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,340
他遇见的每个妞儿他都把不到
He can't call dibs on every girl he meets.

1337
01:00:42,717 --> 01:00:45,208
我们本来要一起约会的
We were supposed to go out on a date together.

1338
01:00:45,319 --> 01:00:47,947
我们还会约会的  起码我觉得会
We are going out on a date. I thought so.

1339
01:00:48,055 --> 01:00:49,215
不可能了  不可能
We're not anymore! No!

1340
01:00:49,323 --> 01:00:50,312
什么
Really?

1341
01:00:50,424 --> 01:00:53,074
你都和我的室友睡了  
'Cause after you fuck my roommate 

1342
01:00:53,075 --> 01:00:54,520
我们之间完了
That kind of ends it with me!

1343
01:00:54,662 --> 01:00:56,630
你说什么呢  别那么跟我说话
What are you talking about? Don't treat me like that.

1344
01:00:57,131 --> 01:01:00,328
你知道我怎么想的吗  我觉得你就是一个傍星族
Just so you know how I'm seeing you? You're a starfucker.

1345
01:01:00,434 --> 01:01:02,732
那种见了明星就和他上床的女孩
You're a girl who met a star and then fucked him.

1346
01:01:02,837 --> 01:01:04,498
而且他甚至不出名
And he's not even that famous!

1347
01:01:04,605 --> 01:01:07,768
要是我室友真是个帅气名人的话呢
What if like a real good-looking celebrity was my roommate?

1348
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:09,940
要是我和詹姆斯・麦克沃伊
What if I lived with, you know, 

1349
01:01:09,941 --> 01:01:11,834
或是裘德・洛 一起住呢
James Mcavoy or Jude Law or something?

1350
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,678
不知道  我可能都上
I don't know. I probably would fuck both of those people.

1351
01:01:14,782 --> 01:01:15,749
别这么说
Don't say that.

1352
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:17,442
真抱歉  你就不能降低点标准吗
I'm sorry! Lower the bar a little bit.

1353
01:01:17,718 --> 01:01:19,242
我简直不敢相信
I can't believe that!

1354
01:01:20,955 --> 01:01:23,401
如果有一个性感尤物
If a hot girl walked over here, naked, 

1355
01:01:23,402 --> 01:01:25,305
光着身子走过来
And was like, "do my body,"

1356
01:01:25,305 --> 01:01:26,188
一边说"上我吧"  你肯定照做的
You would.

1357
01:01:26,327 --> 01:01:27,692
你肯定会上她
You would have sex with her.

1358
01:01:27,795 --> 01:01:30,161
才不会呢  我会觉得很不爽
No, I'd feel really uncomfortable.

1359
01:01:30,298 --> 01:01:32,596
也许我会邀请她去看威尔科表演
And then I might ask her to a Wilco show.

1360
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:32,916
好吧
Okay,

1361
01:01:32,916 --> 01:01:34,688
你真是我在这世上遇到的
Then you're the first guy in the

1362
01:01:34,688 --> 01:01:37,069
唯一一个这样的男人
World that I've ever met that's like that.

1363
01:01:37,572 --> 01:01:40,132
我以为你会是那种等上两个月
I thought you were the kind of girl that would wait two months

1364
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:41,265
才会和什么人上床的女孩
And then have sex with a guy.

1365
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:42,342
我没想到你居然
I didn't think you would just...

1366
01:01:42,443 --> 01:01:44,502
我是独立的女性
I'm an independent woman.

1367
01:01:44,612 --> 01:01:47,080
我有权利和任何人上床
I'm allowed to fuck people.

1368
01:01:47,381 --> 01:01:48,849
我要是早知道  
Well, if I had known that, 

1369
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:50,318
我就会早点约你了
I would have scheduled our date a lot sooner!

1370
01:01:52,153 --> 01:01:54,587
省省吧  我甚至不认识你
Give me a break. I don't even know you.

1371
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:57,724
这是我们有史以来最长的对话
This is the longest conversation we've ever had.

1372
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:08,467
别对我发脾气  我说给你10天时间
Don't be mad at me. I said I'd give you 10 days.

1373
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:10,059
但我给了你三周
I gave you three weeks.

1374
01:02:13,474 --> 01:02:14,702
我以为你在开玩笑
I thought you were joking, man.

1375
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:17,277
实话跟你说吧
I'm gonna be honest with you.

1376
01:02:17,378 --> 01:02:20,176
我们想上遇到的每一个姑娘
We... we... we want to fuck every girl that we meet.

1377
01:02:21,549 --> 01:02:22,516
就是这么回事
That's how it works.

1378
01:02:22,617 --> 01:02:24,346
要是每个你想睡的
If I didn't sleep with every girl 

1379
01:02:24,347 --> 01:02:25,643
姑娘我都不碰
You wished you could sleep with,

1380
01:02:25,753 --> 01:02:27,345
我就没妞儿可以上了
I wouldn't sleep with anybody.

1381
01:02:27,455 --> 01:02:29,980
这次是沟通失策  我们能搞定的
It's a communication breakdown. We can fix this.

1382
01:02:30,524 --> 01:02:32,321
我不管  事实就是你和她嘿咻了
I don't care. The fact that you had sex with her...

1383
01:02:32,426 --> 01:02:36,760
我永远也做不到那样的事
I can never do anything like that with her.

1384
01:02:36,864 --> 01:02:39,353
所以你真的要放弃她  
So, you're really not gonna chase 

1385
01:02:39,354 --> 01:02:41,164
就因为我和她睡了
This girl just because I was with her?

1386
01:02:41,268 --> 01:02:42,326
没错
Yeah.

1387
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:44,128
真是的
Huh.

1388
01:02:45,006 --> 01:02:47,133
某种程度上  这有点失礼
It's kind of insulting, on some level.

1389
01:02:49,977 --> 01:02:52,309
想和我去看威尔科表演吗
Wanna go to Wilco with me?

1390
01:02:53,147 --> 01:02:56,139
我也想去  但我得和托比・莫拉尔一起去
I wish I could, but I'm going with Tobey Maguire.

1391
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,844
我可能会在电影里演他的弟弟
I might play his little brother in this movie.

1392
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,516
真希望我能得到那个角色
I hope I get it.

1393
01:03:10,564 --> 01:03:12,786
说点什么  你不能摆脱的  
Give me something. You didn't get rid of them. 

1394
01:03:12,787 --> 01:03:14,056
什么令你难以摆脱
What did you get rid of?

1395
01:03:14,168 --> 01:03:15,897
我有个好建议
Well, I, you know, I got a few good offers,

1396
01:03:16,003 --> 01:03:18,437
但说实话  我不知道每辆车值多少钱
But honestly, I don't know how much each car is worth and I...

1397
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:20,404
他们一直想都买下来
They keep on wanting to buy all of them

1398
01:03:20,508 --> 01:03:21,907
-对我来说很难  -别太当回事
- And it's hard for me to... - Don't make it a big deal.

1399
01:03:22,009 --> 01:03:24,842
别因为这个胃疼  卖了它们
Don't get a stomach-ache over it. Just sell them.

1400
01:03:24,945 --> 01:03:26,139
捐给慈善机构  就不管了
Give it to a charity. Move on.

1401
01:03:26,247 --> 01:03:27,214
好吧
Okay.

1402
01:03:27,381 --> 01:03:28,575
我只是想捐献一点东西
I just want to be happy about

1403
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:29,707
并为此感到高兴
Giving something away, you know.

1404
01:03:29,817 --> 01:03:30,784
好吧
Okay.

1405
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:31,852
那么
So...

1406
01:03:33,487 --> 01:03:36,081
有些事我得和你说  乔治
There's something I've really been wanting to tell you, George.

1407
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:37,282
啊哦
Uh-oh.

1408
01:03:39,427 --> 01:03:41,353
我觉得你应该
I feel as though you need to tell

1409
01:03:41,353 --> 01:03:43,921
和除了我之外的什么人说说你的情况
Someone other than me about your condition.

1410
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,066
我不想那么做
I don't want to do that.

1411
01:03:47,168 --> 01:03:48,601
乔治  人们很在乎你
George, people care about you.

1412
01:03:48,703 --> 01:03:50,671
你应该接受他们的关心
You have to let them be there for you.

1413
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:53,222
我一旦告诉了别人  
I tell somebody, then it's all gonna change, 

1414
01:03:53,223 --> 01:03:55,439
就什么都变了  而且无法挽回
And you can't get it back.

1415
01:03:56,243 --> 01:03:58,074
事情已经变了  乔治
Everything's already changed, George,

1416
01:03:58,179 --> 01:04:02,343
现实是很快你就会病入膏肓
And the truth is soon you're gonna start getting very sick

1417
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,509
到时候你会想要有人在你身边  而且不是我
And you are gonna want someone other than me there.

1418
01:04:05,052 --> 01:04:07,247
我是说  你和你的父母说了吗
I mean, have you... have you even told your parents yet?

1419
01:04:07,354 --> 01:04:09,447
我的父母已经年近古稀
My parents are in their mid-70s.

1420
01:04:09,557 --> 01:04:12,219
听到这个消息会吓死的
They would drop dead if they heard about this.

1421
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:14,123
朋友呢  你应该告诉你的朋友们
Friends. You must want to tell your friends.

1422
01:04:14,228 --> 01:04:16,253
我没有真正的朋友
I don't really have any friends.

1423
01:04:16,363 --> 01:04:18,661
我有的只是一些炮友和狐朋狗友们
I have people I shoot the shit with and fuck around with,

1424
01:04:18,766 --> 01:04:20,563
但并没有很亲密的朋友
But there's nobody I'm really close with.

1425
01:04:20,668 --> 01:04:22,101
我有一些娱乐圈的朋友
I've got showbiz friends.

1426
01:04:22,203 --> 01:04:25,639
安迪・迪克算不上朋友  只是一个熟人
Andy Dick isn't a friend. He's just a guy you know.

1427
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,208
你是最亲密的朋友  可我却不喜欢你
You're my closest friend, and I don't even like you.

1428
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:31,469
你得把这事告诉其他人
You have to tell someone other than me, man.

1429
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:33,240
我不能是唯一知情的人
I can't be the only one who knows.

1430
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:34,780
我从来没有处理过这样的事
I've never dealt with anything like this.

1431
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:37,248
我的爷爷奶奶都健在
All my grandparents are alive.

1432
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:40,718
跟你说不是听你哭的  不许哭
Listen, this is not your job to cry. Your job is to not cry.

1433
01:04:40,821 --> 01:04:43,756
乔治  我只是跟你坦诚不公的谈谈
I'm just trying to talk to you man-to-man, George.

1434
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:45,859
还男人呢  哭个啥劲
As a man, you are crying right now.

1435
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:46,949
我没哭啊
I'm not crying.

1436
01:04:47,061 --> 01:04:48,570
让人看了  还以为咱俩分手了
People are gonna think we just broke up 

1437
01:04:48,571 --> 01:04:49,325
或是出啥事了呢
Or something, Ira.

1438
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:51,091
赶快别哭了
Stop doing what you're doing.

1439
01:04:51,198 --> 01:04:52,187
好吧
Okay, I’ll stop.

1440
01:04:52,299 --> 01:04:56,201
真丢人显眼啊  脸都抽吧成啥样了
You're causing a scene. You're making crazy faces now, Ira.

1441
01:04:56,804 --> 01:04:59,295
眼睛睁开  别挤了
Open your eyes. Stop crying.

1442
01:05:00,508 --> 01:05:02,908
嚎个什么劲  跟个废物似的
You're making noises now? You look like the incredible hulk.

1443
01:05:04,111 --> 01:05:05,976
老天  真是不想让我好好吃顿饭啊
Jesus, you're spitting on my shrimp,

1444
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,479
-傻瓜  -对不起
- You asshole. - I'm sorry.

1445
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:09,816
对不起
God, I'm sorry.

1446
01:05:09,917 --> 01:05:10,906
快点擦了吧
Come on. Wipe it off.

1447
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:13,277
偶滴神呀
Jesus Christ.

1448
01:05:14,255 --> 01:05:16,587
对不起  我也没办法
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

1449
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:17,987
太糟糕了
This is the worst.

1450
01:05:18,092 --> 01:05:20,560
为啥得病的偏偏是我呢
Why didn't I just get hit by a fucking foul ball?

1451
01:05:21,629 --> 01:05:23,688
啥都搞砸了  傻瓜
You ruined the palm, you fucking ass.

1452
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:29,166
本来这顿饭可以吃得好好的
This could have been the best meal, ever.

1453
01:05:30,337 --> 01:05:31,770
吃冰棒还是来点别的
Should I get you ice chips or something?

1454
01:05:31,872 --> 01:05:33,703
不要  我很好
No, I'm good.

1455
01:05:34,475 --> 01:05:35,840
你还没孩子  对吧
You never had any kids, huh?

1456
01:05:35,943 --> 01:05:37,467
对  还没有
No. No. We didn't get to that.

1457
01:05:37,578 --> 01:05:39,068
我都有3个了
I have three.

1458
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,147
我知道
I know.

1459
01:05:40,247 --> 01:05:42,340
都是小弟弟弄出来的
Three kids to carry on the dick legacy.

1460
01:05:42,449 --> 01:05:44,421
你不是只吹箫吗
How the hell did you have any kids with 

1461
01:05:44,422 --> 01:05:46,613
怎么搞出那么多个孩子
All the penises you've blown?

1462
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,349
我把自己的精液吹进她们的阴道里
I sucked my own dick and spit it into their vagina.

1463
01:05:51,959 --> 01:05:52,748
大多数人
I mean, knowing that. 

1464
01:05:52,749 --> 01:05:54,723
一辈子都浑浑噩噩
Most people just go through life asleep anyways.

1465
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:56,278
有些人一直迷迷糊糊
Some of those people don't even wake up 

1466
01:05:56,279 --> 01:05:56,922
直到有天
Until they get, you know,

1467
01:05:57,031 --> 01:05:58,396
他们接到死神的电话
The Dr. Death call, you know.

1468
01:05:58,499 --> 01:06:01,297
我是死神  你要死了  
"This is Dr. Death! You're going to die. "

1469
01:06:01,402 --> 01:06:03,267
不要怕  乔治
"Don't be afraid, George.

1470
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:08,171
不过是死亡的召唤  看开点  浑蛋
"It's just death calling. Cheer up, motherfucker!"

1471
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:10,300
看开个毛
Yeah. Fuck negativity.

1472
01:06:10,411 --> 01:06:13,005
操他娘的蛋  见鬼去吧
Fuck it in the ass with a Chinese monkey!

1473
01:06:13,948 --> 01:06:15,939
真想心平气和的和你唠唠家常
I wish I wasn't so fucking angry with you right now.

1474
01:06:16,717 --> 01:06:18,981
抱歉  我不是个好哥哥
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I wasn't a good brother.

1475
01:06:19,086 --> 01:06:20,451
你简直太烂了
You were a terrible brother.

1476
01:06:20,554 --> 01:06:21,953
扔下我们  管都不管
You just left us and you didn't care.

1477
01:06:22,056 --> 01:06:23,956
一点儿都没放在心里
You didn't give a shit about us.

1478
01:06:24,058 --> 01:06:25,923
-你连一句...-你不是搬到堪萨斯去了吗
- You don't even give a... - You moved to Kansas.

1479
01:06:26,026 --> 01:06:27,960
-那我该去堪萨斯串串门吗  -对呀
- Am I supposed to visit you in Kansas?  - Yes.

1480
01:06:28,062 --> 01:06:29,556
我以为你不想被打扰
I thought that's why you moved there, 

1481
01:06:29,557 --> 01:06:30,553
才搬去哪里的
So you didn't get visitors.

1482
01:06:30,664 --> 01:06:31,995
你可真自私
You're so fucking selfish.

1483
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:33,088
我知道
I know.

1484
01:06:33,234 --> 01:06:36,294
你见过我儿子几面  也就3次吧
You've only seen my son, like, three times.

1485
01:06:36,403 --> 01:06:39,201
我一直给他寄DVD啊
I send him fucking DVDs all the time.

1486
01:06:39,306 --> 01:06:41,297
他不需要你的DVD
He doesn't want your DVDs.

1487
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:42,966
他想你成为他生活中的一部分
He wants you to be a part of his life.

1488
01:06:43,077 --> 01:06:45,068
他想成为你生活中的一部分
He wants to be a part of yours.

1489
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:47,613
太感人了
Wow. This has been great.

1490
01:06:47,715 --> 01:06:51,549
我要给爸打电话 多和家人聚聚 
I want to call dad now and just have more family time.

1491
01:06:51,752 --> 01:06:54,721
我们对你做了什么  我跟爸不一样
What did we ever do to you? I'm not dad.

1492
01:06:57,091 --> 01:06:59,423
你说对了
You are right.

1493
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:03,690
你很好  非常好  抱歉我不了解你儿子
You're very, very nice, and I'm sorry I don't know your son.

1494
01:07:03,797 --> 01:07:06,766
抱歉  我也不了解你了
I'm sorry I don't know you anymore.

1495
01:07:06,934 --> 01:07:09,061
幸好你也不了解我
I'm glad you don't know me.

1496
01:07:09,169 --> 01:07:10,261
我希望我不了解你
I wish I did.

1497
01:07:11,805 --> 01:07:14,672
相信我  你会失望的
You'd be let down, believe me.

1498
01:07:22,816 --> 01:07:24,613
哥们
Oh, man.

1499
01:07:30,557 --> 01:07:32,047
老天
Oh, god.

1500
01:07:35,229 --> 01:07:36,821
谁啊
Who's that?

1501
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:38,831
我以前想娶的那丫头
That's the girl I was gonna marry...

1502
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:42,362
之后她就潇洒去了
...but then she smartened up.

1503
01:07:43,237 --> 01:07:45,671
这个10岁  这个6岁
So, she's 10 and she's six.

1504
01:07:45,773 --> 01:07:48,139
好可爱
So cute.

1505
01:07:48,242 --> 01:07:50,301
这个小的可真像你啊
Jeez, she looks like you, the little one, huh?

1506
01:07:51,512 --> 01:07:54,345
咋回事  一点都没遗传你老公啊
What's the matter? Your guy doesn't have any DNA in him?

1507
01:07:54,448 --> 01:07:57,008
完全是劳拉的翻版
That's all Laura.

1508
01:07:57,184 --> 01:07:58,913
她们很爱打闹  不过很可爱
They fight a lot, but they're cute.

1509
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:03,186
多谢你能来看我
Yeah. Thank you so much for coming here.

1510
01:08:03,757 --> 01:08:05,019
我从前也想看你来着
I wanted to come. I wanted to see you.

1511
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:06,319
你没必要来
You didn't have to come here.

1512
01:08:06,427 --> 01:08:09,123
你不必来  这会给你带来很大压力
You didn't have to. I know it's stressful for you.

1513
01:08:09,563 --> 01:08:11,963
我只是...我很抱歉
I'm just... I'm just... I'm so sorry.

1514
01:08:12,499 --> 01:08:14,797
抱歉我以往的所作所为
I'm so sorry about everything I did.

1515
01:08:15,402 --> 01:08:18,064
没必要说抱歉  都过去12年了
You don't have to be sorry. That was 12 years ago.

1516
01:08:18,172 --> 01:08:20,003
结局总会变好的
Everything worked out for the best.

1517
01:08:20,107 --> 01:08:22,268
多好  看你现在的生活很不错
It's good. Look at your life. This is great.

1518
01:08:22,676 --> 01:08:28,239
对  这是最好的生活  我恨死了
Yes. It's the best life. I hate it. I hate it all.

1519
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:29,509
-我没有...-你不是
- I haven't been... - You don't hate it.

1520
01:08:29,616 --> 01:08:32,517
估计上瘾了  还得接着过下去  
I'm addicted to it, I guess. I keep doing it.

1521
01:08:32,953 --> 01:08:35,854
韦恩  我是艾拉  我打给你说声
Hello, Wayne. This is Ira. I'm calling to say

1522
01:08:35,956 --> 01:08:38,120
我认为你今天来看
I don't think today is a good day for 

1523
01:08:38,121 --> 01:08:39,119
乔治不太适合
You to come by and see George.

1524
01:08:39,426 --> 01:08:39,943
明天还差不多
Maybe tomorrow.

1525
01:08:40,134 --> 01:08:41,308
我看好日程表
So, I’ll give you a call when I know 

1526
01:08:41,309 --> 01:08:42,452
再打给你吧
what the schedule looks like.

1527
01:08:42,563 --> 01:08:44,827
谢谢  一会儿打给你
Thank you. I'll talk to you soon.

1528
01:08:46,233 --> 01:08:48,428
你都成家了  都有家人了
You have a family now. You have a family now.

1529
01:08:48,535 --> 01:08:51,299
我很高兴  当时你作对了  挺过去了
I'm so happy. You did the right thing. You moved on.

1530
01:08:51,405 --> 01:08:53,498
生活过的多好
You got a good life.

1531
01:08:53,607 --> 01:08:56,735
而我一无所有  劳拉  真讨厌
And... And I just got nothing, Laura. I hate that.

1532
01:08:56,844 --> 01:08:59,404
本应该我和你走到一起的
I hate that it could have been me with you.

1533
01:08:59,513 --> 01:09:00,673
拜托别说那个
Don't do that, please?

1534
01:09:00,781 --> 01:09:02,408
抱歉  我昏了头了...
I'm sorry. I just fucking...

1535
01:09:02,516 --> 01:09:04,882
你...本来应该是我和你生下这些孩子的
You... I could have had those kids with you.

1536
01:09:05,886 --> 01:09:09,515
你怎么能背叛我   我不漂亮吗
How could you cheat on me? I was so hot.

1537
01:09:09,623 --> 01:09:11,147
你很漂亮  我不知道
You were. You were so hot. I don't know.

1538
01:09:11,258 --> 01:09:12,555
我很漂亮
I was hot!

1539
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:15,526
我也不知道当时怎么搞的
I don't even know what the fuck I was doing.

1540
01:09:15,629 --> 01:09:20,157
真白痴  别人我都不记得了
I was just a stupid idiot. I don't remember anybody else.

1541
01:09:20,267 --> 01:09:21,859
-你怎么了  -别人我都不记得了
- What was wrong with you? - I don't remember anybody else.

1542
01:09:21,969 --> 01:09:23,630
我只记得你  我也不知道
I only remember you. I don't know.

1543
01:09:23,737 --> 01:09:26,672
我甚至不知道谁拆散的咱们
I don't even know who they were, who fucking ruined us.

1544
01:09:26,774 --> 01:09:29,971
我记不清了   就像从没发生过
They're not in my brain, ever. It's like it didn't happen.

1545
01:09:30,077 --> 01:09:31,942
唯一记得的就是咱俩
The only thing that happened was us.

1546
01:09:32,046 --> 01:09:34,742
你得离开我  而且是必须的
And you ran away 'cause you had to.

1547
01:09:34,848 --> 01:09:36,645
我不得不走
I had to go.

1548
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,981
那时候我再也受不了了  
At the time, I just couldn't do it anymore.

1549
01:09:40,087 --> 01:09:42,282
但是我想明白了一件事
Yeah. But you know what I realized?

1550
01:09:42,389 --> 01:09:44,016
我爱我老公
I love my husband,

1551
01:09:45,426 --> 01:09:48,088
但和你是不一样的
But it's just not the same.

1552
01:09:49,129 --> 01:09:52,758
过去我非常爱你
And I loved you so much and...

1553
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:56,495
这我知道
I know, I know, I know, I know.

1554
01:09:56,603 --> 01:09:59,834
我跟你一样
I have the same thing. I have the same thing.

1555
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,534
不要难过
Don't feel bad. Don't feel bad.

1556
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:05,804
我爱你  一直爱你
I love you. I love you. I always loved you.

1557
01:10:05,913 --> 01:10:09,405
最荒唐的就是他也背叛我
And the crazy thing is he cheats on me, too.

1558
01:10:09,516 --> 01:10:10,483
真讨厌
I hate...

1559
01:10:10,584 --> 01:10:12,245
他和你一样花
He's like an Australian you.

1560
01:10:13,053 --> 01:10:16,955
这家伙真恨人  他疯了不成
I fucking hate this guy. Is he crazy?

1561
01:10:17,057 --> 01:10:20,254
你是唯一
It's just that you were the one.

1562
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:25,696
是我...现在的...从前的...的爱
Just you are... Were... Are the love...

1563
01:10:28,569 --> 01:10:32,403
一生的爱人  我只爱你
Love of my life. And I just love you.

1564
01:10:40,948 --> 01:10:43,314
这个时候真不该拥抱啊
Yeah, the hug was a mistake, wasn't it?

1565
01:10:46,653 --> 01:10:48,780
你没病吧
You're not sick, are you?

1566
01:10:48,889 --> 01:10:51,949
你这么做就是拒绝我吧
You're just doing that to get me down here, huh?

1567
01:10:54,895 --> 01:10:56,419
还是这双手
There are those hands again.

1568
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:57,997
一双大手
My big hands.

1569
01:10:58,132 --> 01:10:59,997
相比之下我小弟弟好小
Always made my penis look small.

1570
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:03,692
谢谢你  大手啊  真难忘啊
Thank you, hands, for that complex.

1571
01:11:05,772 --> 01:11:08,206
天啊
Yes. Jeez.

1572
01:11:08,308 --> 01:11:14,269
两只放一起  显得就更小了
The two of them together, it was a guaranteed dwarfing. Okay.

1573
01:11:25,225 --> 01:11:26,852
这样才对
That was worth it.

1574
01:11:27,294 --> 01:11:29,194
现在要算加班时间了
We're into overtime now, just so you know.

1575
01:11:29,296 --> 01:11:31,161
时间过得好快
Jeez, that came quick.

1576
01:11:31,265 --> 01:11:33,233
还是不是好哥们啊
I wish that you guys were really my friends

1577
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,961
陪我练歌  还跟我提钱
And I didn't have to pay you to jam with me.

1578
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,440
好吧  那就继续吧
All right, so let's keep going then.

1579

所有的计划打算
All my little plans and schemes

1580
01:11:59,393 --> 01:12:03,659
如梦一般被遗忘
Lost like some forgotten dream

1581
01:12:05,132 --> 01:12:06,326
似乎...
Seems like all I...

1582
01:12:06,433 --> 01:12:08,060
-蒂亚哥  -什么事  乔治

谢谢  肯定看上去很漂亮
Thank you. They sure look beautiful.

1585
01:12:11,705 --> 01:12:13,260
你这样的爷们
Only a guy with a big cock 

1586
01:12:13,261 --> 01:12:15,334
才能把花伺候好啊
Like you could make roses this beautiful.

1587
01:12:16,777 --> 01:12:20,543
无需孤单一人
Don't need to be alone

1588
01:12:22,616 --> 01:12:26,382
无需孤单一人

1589
01:12:29,423 --> 01:12:34,656

1590
01:12:34,761 --> 01:12:37,127
真正的爱
Yes, it's real love

1591
01:12:37,231 --> 01:12:38,698
你做单人喜剧吗
You doing stand-up at all?

1592
01:12:38,799 --> 01:12:41,290
这是我3年来第一次离开自己的房子
This is actually the first time I’ve left the house in three years.

1593
01:12:41,401 --> 01:12:42,891
但我有时在我的屋子里
But I will sometimes, in my house,

1594
01:12:43,036 --> 01:12:45,129
当着孩子的面  演个5到6分钟
In front of my kids, I’ll do five, six minutes.

1595
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:46,205
也没好段子 
Not good stuff. 

1596
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:47,605
就是"你哪儿冒出来的啊"一些老节目
It's a lot of "where you from?" you know.

1597
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:48,936
不说笑了
But, you know, all kidding aside,

1598
01:12:49,042 --> 01:12:50,373
我知道你情况很差

即使这样  你看上去也比他强
But even with that, you look so much better than him.

1600
01:12:57,584 --> 01:13:01,850
天国尽在掌中
The kingdom of heaven is, is in your hands

1601
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:07,586
不愿你从梦中醒来
I don't expect for you to awake from your dreams

1602

我们看了你上一部电影
We watched your last movie on video.

1603
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:12,296
那个人物即使没讲黄段子也很搞笑
A man who is funny doesn't have to work blue.

1604
01:13:12,432 --> 01:13:14,627
你不必自毁形象来娱乐大众
You don't... You don't have to do trash to be funny.

1605
01:13:14,735 --> 01:13:16,134
我跟你说谁是最佳的笑星吧
I'll tell you who was a great comedian.

1606
01:13:16,236 --> 01:13:17,601
拜托那个人就是我把  哪个

1610
01:13:24,978 --> 01:13:28,072
格里森很棒  你也不是很差
Gleason was terrific. And you ain't so bad.

1611
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:30,149

1615
01:13:43,096 --> 01:13:48,295
真正的爱
It's real love it's real

1616

都演砸了
I played it all wrong.

1618
01:14:04,284 --> 01:14:07,276
他来了  看到我了  我来开门  马克
Okay. He's here. We saw each other. Let me answer it. Mark.

1619
01:14:07,387 --> 01:14:09,548
不要  我开  马克
Stop. Let me answer it. Mark, man.

1620

1627
01:14:22,936 --> 01:14:24,192
那部电影是最棒的啊  
That movie's the best '

1628
01:14:24,193 --> 01:14:26,235
你是个男人  然后是个宝宝
Cause you're a man then you're a baby

1629
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,968
然后你要学会当男人 因为...必须...
And then you learn to be a man once you be... You need...

1630
01:14:29,076 --> 01:14:31,340
先变成宝宝再学会怎样当男人
It takes becoming a baby to learn how to become a man.

1632
01:14:34,848 --> 01:14:37,180
不必  让我四处逛逛搅和搅和就好
No, no, no. Let me just walk around and go through your shit.

George and Daisy are here? How the hell did that happen?

1642
01:14:57,871 --> 01:15:00,203
我以为乔治不会来呢  谁邀请的戴西
I didn't think George would come, and who invited Daisy?

1643
01:15:00,307 --> 01:15:01,433
我请来的
I invited her.

1644
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:03,065
你还和戴西上床吗
Are you still sleeping with Daisy?

1645

没  我没有和戴西上床

1649
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:13,164
晚饭时我能坐在乔治旁边吗
Can I sit next to George at dinner?

1650
01:15:13,269 --> 01:15:15,203
你愿意坐哪儿就坐哪儿
Sit wherever the hell you want to sit, man, why?

1651
01:15:15,337 --> 01:15:18,329
我要是能让乔治再大笑一次
I feel like if I can just make George crack up once,

1652
01:15:18,741 --> 01:15:20,140
对我来说意义重大
It'll do huge things for me, like...

1653
01:15:20,242 --> 01:15:21,504
你还编了感恩节段子不成
What, you wrote jokes for Thanksgiving?

1654
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:22,736
我没编段子
I didn't write jokes.

1655
01:15:22,845 --> 01:15:24,574
我只是把东一块西一块
I just wrote down my funniest anecdotes

1656

最有意思的段子串到一起

This is the best. Where's your bedroom?

1662
01:15:37,459 --> 01:15:39,984
打好背包远足吧  你离卧室远着呢
Well, get ready for a hike, 'cause you're standing in it.

1663
01:15:40,095 --> 01:15:41,995

No. It's... Yeah, it's pretty lame.

1664

瞧瞧啊  一唱一合  真像小两口
Look at that, back and forth, like a cute couple.

1674
01:16:03,135 --> 01:16:05,535
就像马克・安东尼和珍妮弗・洛佩兹
You're like Marc Anthony and J. Lo.

1675
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:07,389
我俩以前约过会  
You know, we actually had a date, 

1676
01:16:07,390 --> 01:16:09,567
然后我和那个家伙睡了一下
But then I had sex with that guy,

1677
01:16:09,675 --> 01:16:11,108
史玛丽就和我吹了
So Schmira broke it off.

1678
01:16:11,209 --> 01:16:12,198
逗我玩吧
You kidding me?

1679
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:12,986
别担心  艾拉
Don't worry, Ira.

1680
01:16:12,986 --> 01:16:15,474
你比那边的瘦猴强多了
You know you're a better lover than Pete rose over there.

1681
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:17,412
瞧瞧他啊   要个有个  要型有型 
Look at him. He's got the length and the width.

1682
01:16:17,516 --> 01:16:19,245
想一下他那个老二
Imagine that dong of his.

1683
01:16:19,351 --> 01:16:20,715
一次我瞧见了那个龟头  
I saw the tip of it one time. 

1684
01:16:20,716 --> 01:16:21,512
也比我的大多了
Even that was too big for me.

1685
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,281
不是  一般大小吧
No, it's very normal. Yeah.

1686
01:16:23,388 --> 01:16:24,616
这么说  你喜欢大个的
So, you like big penises?

1687
01:16:24,723 --> 01:16:27,283
其实我的阴道很紧
Well, you know, I have a really skinny vagina, so...

1688
01:16:27,392 --> 01:16:29,189
那就往里面灌点碳酸饮料
If it's skinny, you should try feeding it carbs.

1689
01:16:30,996 --> 01:16:32,588
好玩  天呀
Yeah. All right, well, jeez, you know what?

1690
01:16:32,698 --> 01:16:34,632
我要失陪一下  你俩玩吧
I'm gonna leave you two alone, huh?

1691
01:16:34,733 --> 01:16:35,700
好吧
Yeah, okay.

1692
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:36,893
你们俩人我都很喜欢
I'm falling in love with the both of you.

1693
01:16:37,002 --> 01:16:38,230
火花就要擦出来了
Let the awkwardness begin!

1694
01:16:38,337 --> 01:16:39,326
喜欢你的作品
Love your work.

1695
01:16:42,374 --> 01:16:44,162
抱歉  我该向你抱歉的  
I'm sorry. I owe you an apology. 

1696
01:16:44,163 --> 01:16:45,400
我那天是挺怪的
It's really weird what I did.

1697
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,370
基本是在没有真正谈话之前
I basically yelled at you for cheating on

1698
01:16:47,370 --> 01:16:49,503
我就朝你大喊大叫  怪你背叛我
Me before we had even had a real conversation.

1699
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:52,674
我想明白了  那个好古怪  抱歉
So, I'm aware of that. I know that's weird, and I'm sorry.

1700
01:16:52,784 --> 01:16:54,581
喝醉了和学生乱搞一气
Well, it's not as weird as getting drunk

1701
01:16:54,686 --> 01:16:57,382
说来也不古怪
And having sex with the guy from yo teach...! So...

1702
01:16:57,723 --> 01:17:00,886
我第一次搬过来的时候  自己打飞机
It's okay. When I first moved here, I blew mr. Belvedere.

1703
01:17:01,093 --> 01:17:02,856
大家都那么做
So, everyone does that.

1704
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:04,037
他过来了  乔治朝我们过来了
He's walking. George is walking to us.

1705
01:17:04,146 --> 01:17:06,444
小姐们好啊
Hello, ladies.

1706
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:10,211
里奥  你不给我写段子的借口是什么
So, Leo? what's the excuse for not writing me jokes?

1707
01:17:10,886 --> 01:17:12,751
-你说什么  -你本可以挣一笔的
- What? - You could have made money.

1708
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:14,710
我让你们俩给我写段子
I told both you guys to write jokes for me

1709
01:17:14,711 --> 01:17:15,483
你却没答应
And you decided not to.

1710
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:19,186
怎么  你那天得去配眼镜吗
What, did you have to go to lenscrafters that day?

1711
01:17:19,295 --> 01:17:21,889
开玩笑而已  我挺喜欢你的眼镜的
I was just joking. I like your glasses.

1712
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:25,505
他想让我们俩给他写段子
He wanted both of us to write jokes for him

1713
01:17:25,506 --> 01:17:26,493
你却不告诉我?
And you didn't tell me?

1714
01:17:26,602 --> 01:17:29,298
兄弟  我道歉行了吧  没必要这么歇斯底里
I apologize. it's not worth, like, losing your shit over, man.

1715
01:17:29,405 --> 01:17:30,497
你觉得我不喜欢钱吗
What, you don't think I like money?

1716
01:17:30,606 --> 01:17:31,903
你觉得我不喜欢私人飞机吗
You don't think I like private jets?

1717
01:17:32,007 --> 01:17:33,088
你觉得我不想要这份
You don't think I want a cool job 

1718
01:17:33,089 --> 01:17:34,771
给乔治・西蒙斯写东西的工作吗
Writing for George Simmons?

1719
01:17:34,877 --> 01:17:35,901
我只是觉得你已经干的很棒了
I just think you're doing well.

1720
01:17:36,011 --> 01:17:38,639
你已经即兴表演得如鱼得水了
You know, you're getting gigs at the improv all the time.

1721
01:17:38,747 --> 01:17:40,214
以后会有专门为你写作的人
You're gonna have people writing for you.

1722
01:17:40,316 --> 01:17:43,114
你不需要为别人写东西
You don't need to be writing for other people, you know.

1723
01:17:43,218 --> 01:17:44,651
我明白  我只是  很抱歉  我只是
I know, I'm just... I'm sorry, I just...

1724
01:17:44,753 --> 01:17:47,153
我想为自己争取点东西  我只是
I wanted something for myself and I just, you know...

1725
01:17:47,256 --> 01:17:49,952
只是  你明白的  我操  埃拉
It's just, you know, fuck you, Ira!

1726
01:17:50,526 --> 01:17:52,016
就因为你这么假惺惺的道个歉
Just 'cause you go into faggy-apology mode

1727
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:54,391
并不表示我会马上原谅你
Doesn't mean I'm gonna forgive you right away!

1728
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:55,174
操你的
Fuck you, man.

1729
01:17:55,174 --> 01:17:58,591
我只是做了你一直在做的事
I did the exact same thing you've been doing this whole time.

1730
01:17:58,701 --> 01:18:00,293
你太好胜了  一直都是的 
You're being competitive. you do that all the time.

1731
01:18:00,402 --> 01:18:01,630
现在我也这样  不行吗
I'm doing it now, okay?

1732
01:18:01,737 --> 01:18:03,466
-我没跟你竞争  -你有
- I didn't make it competitive! - Yes, you did.

1733
01:18:03,572 --> 01:18:05,403
你有为生计所迫过吗  没有吧
Have you ever had to work for money? no.

1734
01:18:05,507 --> 01:18:07,065
你又不是在煤矿里挖煤  埃拉
You didn't work at a coal mine, Ira!

1735
01:18:07,176 --> 01:18:09,940
只是在熟食店工作  别抱怨了
You worked at a deli! stop crying about it!

1736
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:12,707
而且我本来只用在那沙发床上睡六个月的
I was only supposed to be on that pull-out couch for six months!

1737
01:18:12,815 --> 01:18:14,806
我们应该交换的  但从没换过
And we were supposed to trade! and we never did!

1738
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:16,350
对  六个月后我们从未交换过
Yeah, we never did switch after six months.

1739
01:18:16,452 --> 01:18:17,419
对  相当对
Yeah. exactly.

1740
01:18:17,519 --> 01:18:19,009
知道为什么吗  因为房租是我付的  埃拉  
You know why? 'cause I pay rent, ira!

1741
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:20,554
不是你付的  是你爸妈付的
You don't pay rent. your parents pay rent!

1742
01:18:20,656 --> 01:18:22,180
他们才应该来睡床  明明就是你的错
Why don't they move in? it's your fault.

1743
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:26,685
嘿嘿嘿  清教徒  印第安人  
Hey, hey, hey. Pilgrims, Indians, 

1744
01:18:26,686 --> 01:18:28,059
别吵了好吗
Can we please stop fighting?

1745
01:18:28,197 --> 01:18:30,961
今天是感恩节  我们有客人  麻烦消停一下
It's Thanksgiving. we have guests inside. please stop.

1746
01:18:31,066 --> 01:18:33,830
我不吵了  讨厌吵架
I'm not fighting anymore. I'm done fighting.

1747
01:18:33,936 --> 01:18:35,836
-多谢  -你说黛西是傍星族
- Thank you. - You called Daisy a starfucker?

1748
01:18:35,938 --> 01:18:37,371
那你干吗不每晚抓着乔治・西蒙斯的蛋
Why don't you go cup George Simmons' balls

1749
01:18:37,473 --> 01:18:40,340
哄着他睡觉呢  埃拉
While you talk him to sleep every night, Ira?

1750
01:18:40,442 --> 01:18:42,034
里奥
Leo.

1751
01:18:42,444 --> 01:18:43,411
抱歉
Sorry.

1752
01:18:43,946 --> 01:18:47,473
要不你来试试吧  我的蛋不挑食的
I would let you do that, too. my balls are for everybody.

1753
01:18:49,618 --> 01:18:53,213
好吧  开始有点感恩节的气氛了
Okay. it's starting to feel like Thanksgiving around here.

1754
01:18:53,956 --> 01:18:55,048
我们去吃点东西吧
Let's eat some food.

1755
01:19:00,963 --> 01:19:03,659
你竟然搞了黛西  伙计
I can't believe you screwed Daisy, man.

1756
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:06,225
什么
What?

1757
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:10,501
有人要做餐前祷告或者说点什么吗
So, does anybody want to say grace or anything?

1758
01:19:10,606 --> 01:19:12,801
显然  里奥是个好作家  来吧  起来吧
Leo's a good writer, apparently. come on, get up there.

1759
01:19:12,908 --> 01:19:14,432
是啊  里奥
Yeah, Leo.

1760
01:19:14,543 --> 01:19:15,908
里奥  来吧  里奥
Leo! do it, Leo.

1761
01:19:16,011 --> 01:19:16,978
下回吧  下回吧
I'm okay, I'm okay.

1762
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:19,343
好吧  我来吧  我来为大家说点什么
All right, let me go. I'll do it for us.

1763
01:19:19,448 --> 01:19:21,507
我来致词吧
Let me get it done.

1764
01:19:21,617 --> 01:19:26,418
首先很庆幸我们的家人没有来
Okay, so first let's give thanks to our families not being here.

1765
01:19:27,589 --> 01:19:30,490
家人不来  总是自在一些的
It's always easier, always easier without the family.

1766
01:19:31,326 --> 01:19:33,146
真不可思议
It's funny

1767
01:19:33,147 --> 01:19:35,194
直到今天我看着你们
I see you guys and you are just so much younger than me.

1768
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:38,561
比我年轻的你们  才明白自己真的老了
And I had no idea I was the old guy until I looked at you guys.

1769
01:19:40,135 --> 01:19:42,296
就好像小时候  我鼻子一直很大
It was like when I was growing up, I had a big nose.

1770
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:43,453
但却一直不自知
I had no idea until

1771
01:19:43,454 --> 01:19:45,669
直到某天我到嘉普[服装店]面对着三面镜
I went to the GAP and saw a three-way mirror,

1772
01:19:45,774 --> 01:19:48,242
才突然发现  哇  我怎么有这么大个鼻子
And I was like, "wow, I didn't know I had that thing. "

1773
01:19:49,445 --> 01:19:52,903
其实  年轻真的很好
Yeah. no, it's a... it's good to be young.

1774
01:19:53,015 --> 01:19:55,745
老了就越来越衰  所以享受青春吧  
It kind of sucks being old, so just enjoy this.

1775
01:19:55,851 --> 01:19:59,844
享受时光吧  白驹过隙  真的
Enjoy time. time slips away, I promise you.

1776
01:19:59,955 --> 01:20:03,413
20年前我也参加过这样一个聚会
I had a dinner like this 20 years ago

1777
01:20:03,559 --> 01:20:07,620
和朋友们一起  但现在大家都失去联系了
With guys that we just, like, lost touch with each other.

1778
01:20:07,729 --> 01:20:10,926
我再没跟他们联络过  有些已去世了
I never talk to them anymore. some of them are dead.

1779
01:20:11,767 --> 01:20:16,136
所以  你们不要  沧海桑田
So, yeah, you don't... things slip away.

1780
01:20:17,673 --> 01:20:20,699
如果你爱着某人  千万别错过他们
If you love somebody, don't let them slip away.

1781
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,775
我保证
I swear to you,

1782
01:20:23,879 --> 01:20:26,404
这会是你们最难忘的感恩节
This will be your most memorable Thanksgiving,

1783
01:20:26,548 --> 01:20:28,278
能让你回味一生的感恩节
The one that you'll want the rest of your life

1784
01:20:28,279 --> 01:20:29,210
能让你赞不绝口说
the one that you say,

1785
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:31,946
老兄  那天晚上的时光真是无与伦比
"Man, it was never as good as that night. "

1786
01:20:32,054 --> 01:20:36,457
所以  享受这个夜晚吧  享受里奥的蛋蛋
So, let this night be great. enjoy the taste of Leo's balls.

1787
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,284
动起来吧
Rock 'n ' roll!

1788
01:20:40,596 --> 01:20:42,337
天哪  每次站在你旁边  
Jesus, every time I'm near you 

1789
01:20:42,338 --> 01:20:44,225
我都觉得自己像他妈的丹尼・德维托[意指很矮]
I feel like fucking Danny DeVito.

1790
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:45,135
我旁边的人
Everybody feels like 

1791
01:20:45,136 --> 01:20:47,063
都觉得自己像丹尼・德维托
Danny DeVito when you know they walk by me.

1792
01:20:47,169 --> 01:20:48,466
是啊  你就是个巨人
Yeah. you're a giant.

1793
01:20:53,575 --> 01:20:54,542
我不想让你过分乐观
I don't want to get your hopes up.

1794
01:20:55,744 --> 01:20:58,188
我们让你做这个实验治疗时
We put you on this experimental medication

1795
01:20:58,189 --> 01:20:59,236
没报多大希望
Without much optimism.

1796
01:20:59,348 --> 01:21:02,441
做这个治疗大约8%的患者
About 8% of all the people that

1797
01:21:02,442 --> 01:21:03,546
结果是好的
We put on this medication get positive results.

1798
01:21:04,753 --> 01:21:08,086
而你就属于这8%的幸运儿
You actually belong to these 8%.

1799
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,657
我检查了你的血液系统
I looked through your blood work,

1800
01:21:09,758 --> 01:21:12,693
没有发现任何疾病迹象
And I couldn't find any traces of the disease.

1801
01:21:13,695 --> 01:21:16,027
我不想这么早就告诉你的
I don't want to speak too soon,

1802
01:21:16,131 --> 01:21:17,655
但说不定你已经战胜病魔了
But we may have beaten this thing.

1803
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,187
你是在报复我拿你说笑吗
Are you fucking with me 'cause I fucked with you?

1804
01:21:23,288 --> 01:21:26,587
这就是好消息了  邦德先生
So, that's the good news, Mr. Bond.

1805
01:21:29,027 --> 01:21:31,689
这是  这是好消息
So, this is, this is... this is good news.

1806
01:21:32,864 --> 01:21:34,832
现在喜欢我的口音了吗
Like my accent now?

1807
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:36,696
现在我确实喜欢你的口音了
Now I like your accent, yeah.

1808
01:21:37,369 --> 01:21:40,167
我兴奋了一早上想告诉你这个消息
I was excited all morning to tell you this news.

1809
01:21:40,672 --> 01:21:43,038
怎么办  我该  该干些什么
So, what happens now? what do i... what do I do now?

1810
01:21:43,141 --> 01:21:46,042
也许你可以再去演喜剧电影
Maybe you can make another funny movie

1811
01:21:46,043 --> 01:21:46,872
让我笑笑
That I could laugh about.

1812
01:21:47,012 --> 01:21:48,416
对哦
Yeah. wow. 

1813
01:21:48,417 --> 01:21:52,279
我真没指望治疗能成功
I wasn't expecting this to really work.

1814
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,715
我都习惯当病人了
I was getting used to being sick.

1815
01:21:53,818 --> 01:21:56,719
我真的认为自己已经接受这个现实了
I was actually thinking I was pretty good at that.

1816
01:21:56,821 --> 01:21:58,755
回归你以前的生活吧
Get back to your life.

1817
01:22:06,965 --> 01:22:09,331
嘿  我是埃拉  现在不在家  请留言
Hey, this is Ira. I'm not in. leave a message.

1818
01:22:10,569 --> 01:22:14,616
埃拉  我有个秘密要告诉你
Ira, I have a secret to tell you. 

1819
01:22:14,617 --> 01:22:16,235
你会很高兴的
It will make you happy.

1820
01:22:35,226 --> 01:22:37,217
嗨  伯尼塔
Hi. Bonita?

1821
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:38,296
乔治
George.

1822
01:22:41,633 --> 01:22:44,796
我生过病  你知道吧  然后我去看医生
I was sick, you know that. and I just went to the doctor's.

1823
01:22:44,903 --> 01:22:47,098
他说我的病已经好了
He said I'm not sick anymore.

1824
01:22:47,205 --> 01:22:49,105
恭喜啊
Oh, congratulations.

1825
01:22:52,444 --> 01:22:55,902
我找到了你一直找不到的裤子  在贮藏室里
I found the pants you're looking for. they are in the closet.

1826
01:22:58,183 --> 01:22:59,775
谢谢你
Thank you.

1827
01:23:00,885 --> 01:23:01,874
再见  乔治
Bye, George.

1828
01:23:03,688 --> 01:23:05,986
乔治  是真的吗
George! is it true?

1829
01:23:06,825 --> 01:23:08,122
-是真的  -太好了
- It's true. - Yes!

1830
01:23:08,226 --> 01:23:09,853
没事  没事  来吧
It's all right. all right, go ahead.

1831
01:23:09,961 --> 01:23:10,928
没事了
All right.

1832
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:13,998
天哪  太好了
Oh, god! yeah!

1833
01:23:14,099 --> 01:23:15,191
没事了  宝贝
All right, baby.

1834
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,531
没事了  都好了  现在我们去玩儿点什么
All right, all right. now what the fuck do we do?

- Thank you. - You got cured of AIDS.

1837
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:25,937
我可没得艾滋
I didn't have AIDS.

1838
01:23:26,044 --> 01:23:27,136
嘿  我请你喝杯鸡尾酒吧
Hey, let me get you a cocktail.

1839
01:23:27,245 --> 01:23:28,769
嘿  不会让你得艾滋的  普通的
Hey, not an AIDS cocktail. a regular.

1840
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,370
不  我才不想喝酒  我很好
No, I don't want a drink. I'm good.

1841
01:23:30,482 --> 01:23:33,076
我都想给医生发绶带了
I'm gonna get one of them ribbons.

1842
01:23:33,685 --> 01:23:34,982
-你还活着啊  -是啊...
- You're alive? - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

真是难以置信  这个家伙  这家伙  
Unbelievable! this guy. this guy, man.

1844
01:23:38,289 --> 01:23:40,793
女人你有了  名声你有了
You got the women, you got the fame

1845
01:23:40,794 --> 01:23:42,225
你还他妈的死不了
And you can't fucking die!

1846
01:23:42,327 --> 01:23:44,522
你是不是跟恶魔搞上了  到底怎么回事  伙计
Did you suck the devil's dick? what is it, man?

1847
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:45,687
我想知道秘密
I wanna know the secret.

1848
01:23:45,797 --> 01:23:47,492
其实我告诉了一些人我们做过爱  
I actually told a bunch of people we did have sex,

1849
01:23:47,599 --> 01:23:48,998
如果你还想继续的话
So if you could go along with that.

1850
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,260
-真的吗  -是的
- You did? - Yes.

1851
01:23:50,368 --> 01:23:54,600
每个人都想跟我做爱  但我最好拒绝
Everybody wants to fuck me, but it's better that I don't

1852
01:23:54,706 --> 01:23:56,071
因为你不会想要
Because you don't want...

1853
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:58,335
神秘感总是更吸引人一些的
The mystery is definitely more flattering...

1854
01:23:58,443 --> 01:23:59,410
是吗
Yeah?

1855
01:23:59,511 --> 01:24:02,241
如果太现实就会很晃荡
...and the reality is so, like, flobbety.

1856
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:04,042
-好像说错了  应该是  -浪荡吗  哦是放荡
- Like not the word, but... - Floppety? yeah, lippety.

1857
01:24:04,449 --> 01:24:06,383
对  我看起来就像个三明治
Yeah, I look like this. like a sandwich.

1858
01:24:06,484 --> 01:24:08,247

是有点像  看出来了
That would have been... I could get...

1860
01:24:11,623 --> 01:24:13,284
看看啊
Look at that!

1861
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:15,620
咿噼基呀  操你妈的
"Yippee-ki-yay, motherfucker!"

1862
01:24:15,727 --> 01:24:18,389
该死  该死  我都不知道你这么有力  天哪
Shit! shit! I didn't know you had energy like that. Jesus...

1863
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:22,657
他怎么  他是怎么知道自己病了的
How did he... like, how did he know he had it?

1864
01:24:23,402 --> 01:24:24,122
他说是
He was saying...

1865
01:24:24,122 --> 01:24:26,557
他说他有点头晕乏力
He said that he was, like, dizzy and tired

1866
01:24:26,558 --> 01:24:27,532
就去看医生了
And he went to the doctor,

1867
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,609
然后他就病了  影响血液功能的病
And then he just got... it was in his blood work.

1868
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:33,042
糟糕  我也感觉头晕乏力
That sucks 'cause I get dizzy and tired.

1869
01:24:33,145 --> 01:24:34,112
真的吗
Really?

1870
01:24:35,014 --> 01:24:37,574
所有人  每个人都会生病  我觉得我也要病了
Anybody... anybody gets sick, I think I'm going to get it.

1871
01:24:37,683 --> 01:24:39,776
现在问题是  它会传染吗  不会传染吧
Now, is it contagious? it's not contagious?

1872
01:24:39,885 --> 01:24:40,874
-不会  -你会被传染吗  就像
- No. - Can you get it, like...

1873
01:24:40,986 --> 01:24:44,319
希望不会  我不觉得  我经常在他身边  我感觉...
I hope not. I don't think so. I've been around him a lot. I feel...

1874
01:24:44,423 --> 01:24:45,856
-我感觉...-我也希望不会  因为
- I feel... - I hope not, too, because

1875
01:24:45,958 --> 01:24:48,518
你讲话时  有一点口水喷到我嘴巴上了  所以
When you were talking, a little bit of your spit hit my lip, so...

1876
01:24:48,627 --> 01:24:49,992
-真的吗  -是  你不一定会被传染
- It did? - Yeah. not that you got it,

1877
01:24:50,096 --> 01:24:52,200
但他的口水喷到你嘴上  你再喷到我嘴上  
But he spits on your lip, you spit on mine, 

1878
01:24:52,201 --> 01:24:53,221
不久你就可能听说我的死讯
Next thing you know I'm dead

1879
01:24:53,222 --> 01:24:54,497
以及我老婆上了乔治・洛佩兹的床
And my wife's fucking George Lopez.

1880
01:24:54,867 --> 01:24:56,425
但是我觉得你最好是  知道吗
But I think the best thing for you would be, you know...

1881
01:24:56,535 --> 01:24:58,196
其实除了药物治疗之外最好的治疗方法
The best cure, besides the real cure,

1882
01:24:58,304 --> 01:25:02,035
就是回去继续工作  做你原来的工作
Is to get back to work and do what you do.

1883
01:25:02,441 --> 01:25:04,409
我桌上有一堆给你的片约
There are stacks of offers on my desk for you.

1884
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:05,875
你得重新开始工作
I mean, you can't swing a dead cat

1885
01:25:05,876 --> 01:25:07,411
才算是真正复活了啊
Without hitting an offer for you.

1886
01:25:07,513 --> 01:25:09,003
-这样啊  -对  你准备好了吗
- Oh, good. - Yeah, you ready for this?

1887
01:25:09,115 --> 01:25:11,140
保罗・路德想跟你演哥俩好
Paul Rudd wants to do a bromance with you.

1888
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:14,310
我觉得我  我可能暂时不会再做任何工作
I think I might... I just might even not work for a little while.

1889
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:15,910
我正在考虑  或许该休息一下
I was thinking maybe just, like, taking time off,

1890
01:25:16,021 --> 01:25:19,684
试着让自己过一种普通的生活  就像
Try to get myself in a relationship with, like,

1891
01:25:19,792 --> 01:25:21,555
所有的人类  所有普通的人类
Another human being, a normal one.

1892
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:22,718
来看看我搞不搞得定
Just see if I can handle that.

1893
01:25:22,828 --> 01:25:24,125
这话从你嘴里出来还真奇怪  其实我  我请了个人
Funny you should say that. I've... 'cause I invited someone.

1894
01:25:25,848 --> 01:25:27,941
请了个你一定中意的女人来这
Brought. Invite this woman here today I think you'd really like

1895
01:25:28,049 --> 01:25:29,038
我觉得你一定能跟她打得火热
I think you'd really hit it off with her.

1896
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:31,584
她  她很不错  对于你来说她很新鲜
She's... she's great. she's something new for you.

1897
01:25:31,686 --> 01:25:33,881
是个正经的人  不是应召女
A real person. she's not a waitress.

1898
01:25:33,989 --> 01:25:35,183
也不是演员
She's not an actress.

1899
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:36,257
好吧  谢谢
All right, thanks.

1900
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:38,692
网上约会其实
You know, the internet dating thing actually...

1901
01:25:38,693 --> 01:25:40,626
其实还是有点用的
Actually kind of works.

1902
01:25:41,029 --> 01:25:41,996
不错啊
That's good.

1903
01:25:42,097 --> 01:25:43,496
其实我参加过一些犹约
I've actually been on a couple of jdates.

1904
01:25:43,598 --> 01:25:44,565
真的吗  那什么东西
No way. what's that?

1905
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:45,997
对  你问犹约是什么吗
Yeah... what's a jdate?

1906
01:25:46,101 --> 01:25:48,092
怎么  是最新的网络用语吗
What, is that an internet thing I should know about?

1907
01:25:48,203 --> 01:25:49,761
我不  我不玩那个东西
I'm not... I don't do that shit.

1908
01:25:49,871 --> 01:25:52,965
是一个犹太人交友网站
It's a website where Jewish people can find each other.

01:25:53,074 --> 01:25:55,304
-真的  会员名单里全是犹太人吗  -是啊
- Really? a whole list of Jewish people? - Yeah.

1910
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:58,607
我还以为犹太人不喜欢被写在名单上呢
I didn't think Jewish people liked to be on lists.

1911
01:26:00,181 --> 01:26:02,149
因为纳粹大屠杀
Because of the holocaust.

1912
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,782
再问一下  那网站怎么样
How's this going, by the way?

1913
01:26:08,089 --> 01:26:10,182
认识你很高兴
It's been great to meet you.

1914
01:26:11,826 --> 01:26:14,624
知道吗  我觉得你干了蠢事
You know what? I think you fucked up.

1915
01:26:16,231 --> 01:26:17,198
怎么样
How's that?

1916
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:19,095
我觉得你干了蠢事  我觉得

我觉得你不应该吃那药的
I don't think you should have took that medicine.

1918
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:23,464
为什么
Why not?

1919
01:26:24,839 --> 01:26:26,471
不知道  就我看来
I don't know. personally

1920
01:26:26,472 --> 01:26:27,808
你该让自己死了算了
I think you should have just let yourself die.

1921
01:26:27,942 --> 01:26:29,637
老实说  你现在  现在要怎么办
Honestly, man, what are... what are you gonna do now?

1923
01:26:31,946 --> 01:26:34,141
再随便搞一个小妞吗
Fuck another chick who doesn't like you?

1924
01:26:34,249 --> 01:26:36,342
知道吗  那就是你的人生之路
You know? that was your way out right there.

1925
01:26:36,451 --> 01:26:37,975
现在你他妈的也搁浅了
Now you're fucking stuck.

像我一样搁浅了
You're stuck just like me.

I can't go to fucking Wal-Mart, Kmart.

是啊  没错
Yeah, that's true.

1933
01:26:49,898 --> 01:26:52,059
这他妈的屋子里每个人都盯着我们看
Everyone in this fucking room is either staring at us,

1934
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:53,657
想他妈的照一张照片
Wanting to take a fucking picture.

1935

01:27:06,648 --> 01:27:09,116
雷・拉马诺  演了人人都爱雷蒙德的那家伙
Ray Romano, the guy from everybody loves Raymond.

1943
01:27:09,217 --> 01:27:10,309

Would you like to fuck me? is that what this is?

1949
01:27:21,129 --> 01:27:22,187
我糊涂了  伙计  怎么回事
I don't get it, man. what's going on?

1950
01:27:22,297 --> 01:27:25,391
你想让我现在就挺起来操你吗

其实我一直都很小心  老兄
I just gotta always be on my toes, man.

1953
01:27:30,305 --> 01:27:31,272
你明白吗
You know?

1954
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:32,737
我明白  但是别对雷・拉马诺这样
I see that, but not with Ray Romano.

1955
01:27:32,841 --> 01:27:34,468
这就是我从不出门的原因
This is why I don't go out of the house.

1956
01:27:34,576 --> 01:27:36,840
我以为大家都喜欢你

所以  既然你有  有了这第二次机会  那么
So, now that you got this, this second chance, man, like,

1958

你想要什么
What do you want?

1959
01:27:43,084 --> 01:27:44,915
我其实并不想要什么
I kind of don't want anything.

1960
01:27:46,087 --> 01:27:47,918
那我们在庆祝什么
So, then what are we celebrating?

1961

1963
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:06,006
我是克拉克  打来关心关心你  亲爱的
It's Clarke and i... I'm calling to check on you, matey.

1964
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:13,379
我刚航海归来  吹迪吉里[澳洲土著人乐器]真好玩
I'm back from the sea. it's fun to play with my didjeridoo!

1965
01:28:13,481 --> 01:28:15,847
你听起来有点像海盗啊
You sound a little bit like a pirate.

1966
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:19,386
像澳洲人吗  像克拉克的口音吗
Do I sound Australian? is this what Clarke sounds like?

1967
01:28:19,521 --> 01:28:21,955
你这澳洲口音太可怕了
That's a terrible Australian accent.

1968
01:28:22,056 --> 01:28:23,045
你在干什么呢  劳拉
What are you doing, Laura?

1969
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:24,625
-我打扰你了吗  他在吗  -不不不
- Am I bothering you? is he there? - No, no, no, no, no.

1970
01:28:24,726 --> 01:28:26,455
要我挂掉吗  你怎样了
Am I supposed to hang up? what's going on?

1971
01:28:26,661 --> 01:28:28,856
克拉克去中国出差了
Clarke's away for business in China.

1972
01:28:28,963 --> 01:28:31,625
又让他去找炸春卷了吗
Ah! sent him out for egg rolls again?

1973
01:28:31,733 --> 01:28:34,201
你们都好吧  最近如何
Are you guys all right? what's going on?

1974
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:36,502
梅波尔明天要登台演唱了
Mable has her recital tomorrow.

1975
01:28:36,604 --> 01:28:38,003
她要唱《猫》里面的《回忆》
She's singing memory from cats.

1976
01:28:38,106 --> 01:28:39,095
真的吗
Oh, yeah?

1977
01:28:39,207 --> 01:28:40,401
你知道这首歌吧  《回忆》
You know that song, memory?

1978
01:28:40,508 --> 01:28:42,373
是啊  真希望能亲眼看看
Yeah. I wish I could be there to see that.

1979
01:28:42,477 --> 01:28:43,444
那就来啊
You can come.

1980
01:28:43,545 --> 01:28:45,513
我能去吗  好吧  我真去了
I can come? all right, I'm coming.

1981
01:28:45,613 --> 01:28:46,739
如果看到我和你在台下紧紧相拥
Your daughter will be all right with that?

1982
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,975
你女儿不会有什么不满吧
That I'm sitting right next to you holding you tight?

1983
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:51,677
打住  你感觉怎样
Stop. how are you feeling?

1984
01:28:51,786 --> 01:28:53,651
我很好  我正要
I'm doing good. I'm doing...

1985
01:28:53,755 --> 01:28:55,586
就那样吧  我
It is what it is. I...

1986
01:28:55,690 --> 01:28:57,214
你的检查结果怎么样
So, what happened with your tests?

1987
01:28:57,859 --> 01:29:00,020
劳拉  我们不要谈这个行吗
Laura, let's not talk about all that.

1988
01:29:00,128 --> 01:29:01,254
医生怎么说
What did the doctor say?

1989
01:29:01,863 --> 01:29:05,993
那个瑞典纳粹  他从来没有好消息的
The swedish nazi? he never has good news.

1990
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,796
该怎样就怎样  我不想谈这个
It is what it is. I don't want to talk about it.

1991
01:29:09,838 --> 01:29:12,204
行了  我们谈谈你吧
Come on, let's just talk about you.

1992
01:29:12,307 --> 01:29:14,707
劳拉  你在做什么
What are you doing, Laura?

1993
01:29:14,809 --> 01:29:16,504
想让我边聊天边陪你睡着吗
Do you want me to talk you to sleep?

1994
01:29:16,978 --> 01:29:18,946
天啊  你还记得
Oh, my god. you remember.

1995
01:29:20,582 --> 01:29:21,844
还想我那样做吗
You want me to do that for you?

1996
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:23,440
我睡觉的时候你会跟我说话吗
You will talk to me while I try to go to sleep?

1997
01:29:23,551 --> 01:29:24,922
那我要开电话扬声器了
I'll put you on speakerphone.

1998
01:29:24,923 --> 01:29:26,418
这将是我人生中最好的夜晚
That will be the best night of my life.

1999
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:29,786
我们先不要睡吧  就聊聊劳拉
Let's not go to sleep yet, though, please. Just talk to Laura.

2000
01:29:33,728 --> 01:29:34,717
情况怎么样
Hey, how's it going?

2001
01:29:35,296 --> 01:29:36,923
埃拉  你是我最好的朋友
Ira, you're my best friend.

2002
01:29:37,031 --> 01:29:38,589
我也喜欢你
I like you, too.

2003
01:29:38,733 --> 01:29:40,496
你是我最好的朋友
You're my best friend.

2004
01:29:40,602 --> 01:29:42,331
你听上去心情很爽呀
You sound like you're in a good mood, man.

2005
01:29:42,437 --> 01:29:44,905
我心情超爽  我们马上要出海了
I'm in a great mood because we're setting sail today.

2006
01:29:45,006 --> 01:29:46,496
我们要一起去探险
We're gonna do a gig together!

2007
01:29:46,608 --> 01:29:47,973
埃拉和乔治  终于上路了
Ira and Georgie, finally on the road!

2008
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:53,221
我们要出海吗  去哪里
Oh, we're setting sail, are we? where, where are we going?

2009
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:56,265
我们去旧金山港口
We're going to the port of San Francisco.

2010
01:29:56,266 --> 01:29:57,733
明天就出发
We set sail on the morrow.

2011
01:29:57,835 --> 01:29:59,200
持续多长时间
How much time am I supposed to do?

2012
01:29:59,303 --> 01:30:01,756
看你的老二有多长了
Oh, they've booked you to do

2013
01:30:01,757 --> 01:30:03,763
每英寸相当于一分钟
A minute for every inch of cock you have.

2014
01:30:03,874 --> 01:30:06,434
根据你的兴奋度
You'll be doing two and a half to four minutes,

2015
01:30:06,543 --> 01:30:09,103
你大概只能持续两分半到四分钟了  小埃拉
Depending on your mood, little Ira.

2016
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:14,244
有人邀请我  我有幸参加过一个
I was invited to a... or I was able to go to a fundraiser

2017
01:30:14,351 --> 01:30:15,979
为巴拉克・奥巴马竞选总统
For Barack Obama,

2018
01:30:15,980 --> 01:30:16,842
举办的资金筹集活动
when he was running for president.

2019
01:30:17,488 --> 01:30:21,857
可以近距离跟他接触  然后我就过去了
And you could walk right up to him and I did.

2020
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:25,861
还准备了一个很好的问题  类似于
And I prepared a smart question and I was like,

2021
01:30:25,963 --> 01:30:28,153
"奥巴马参议员  当你还是一名
"Senator obama, when you were

2022
01:30:28,154 --> 01:30:29,934
在波士顿的学生的时候
a student in Boston,

2023
01:30:29,934 --> 01:30:32,527
你有没有遭遇过种族歧视"
Did you encounter any racism?"

2024
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:36,597
他的回答非常非常有趣  他说
And he said something really, really interesting. he said...

2025
01:30:39,743 --> 01:30:41,836
他说  "我可是坎耶・维斯特[著名黑人说唱歌手]"
He said, "I'm Kanye West. "

2026
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:49,710
乔治  有人找你
George, you have a visitor.

2027
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,725
最近好吗
All right. how are you?

2028
01:30:57,828 --> 01:30:58,795
很好
I'm good.

2029
01:30:58,896 --> 01:31:00,727
真激动你能过来
I'm so psyched you came.

2030
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:02,731
-你看上去不错嘛  -谢谢
- Wow, you look amazing! - Thank you.

2031
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:04,596
-你真漂亮  -我觉得穿得太隆重了
- Beautiful. - I think I overdressed.

2032
01:31:04,701 --> 01:31:05,929
绝对没有  你美呆了
No way. you look incredible.

2033
01:31:06,036 --> 01:31:07,025
我只是
I just...

2034
01:31:07,137 --> 01:31:08,627
他在哪儿  克拉克呢
Where... where is he? where is the Clarke?

2035
01:31:10,358 --> 01:31:12,414
克拉克  他出城了  我本想
The Clarke? he's out of town. I was gonna

2036
01:31:12,415 --> 01:31:13,987
带我朋友贝丝一起来的
bring my friend Betsy with me,

2037
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,187
但她儿子有些呕吐  所以
But her son started throwing up, so...

2038
01:31:16,296 --> 01:31:19,026
丈夫出城了  婴儿在呕吐  癫狂的世界
The husband's out of town, baby's vomiting. rock 'n ' roll.

2039
01:31:19,133 --> 01:31:22,591
我喜欢
I like it. yeah. yeah.

2040
01:31:22,703 --> 01:31:24,034
不管怎样  我不想耽误你
Anyway, I don't want to keep you

2041
01:31:24,138 --> 01:31:25,162
碍你的事
Or get in the way.

2042
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:26,796
别  别走啊  来  埃拉  打个招呼
No, don't run away. come on, Ira, say hello.

2043
01:31:27,975 --> 01:31:28,999
嗨  还好吧
Hey, how's it going?

2044
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,703
我得走了  我只是上来打个招呼
So, I'll let you go. I just wanted to say hi.

2045
01:31:31,812 --> 01:31:33,609
别说脏话  别老是说脏话
No cursing. don't curse so much.

2046
01:31:33,714 --> 01:31:34,934
好的  好的  不说脏话  
Okay, all right! nothing dirty.

2047
01:31:34,935 --> 01:31:35,807
我都不知道怎么开口了
I don't know how.

2048
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:37,841
你一下就把我的计划捣毁了一半  
You just cut my set in half,

2049
01:31:37,842 --> 01:31:38,942
但没关系  一会儿见
but that's fine. all right, see you, kid.

2050
01:31:39,052 --> 01:31:40,019
好  祝你好运
Okay, good luck.

2051
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,747
多谢捧场
Thanks for coming.

2052
01:31:43,824 --> 01:31:47,089
中场休息时你去告诉她我好些了  行吗
You gotta tell her I'm better at intermission, all right?

2053
01:31:47,194 --> 01:31:48,684
你还没告诉她你好了吗
You haven't told her that you're better?

2054
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,490
没有  我不太善长这个
No, I'm not good at stuff like that.

2055
01:31:50,597 --> 01:31:52,690
只是  她会不高兴的  她会
Just... she'll be cool with it. she'll be...

2056
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:55,927
不过如果是你告诉她好消息  她就会开心的
You're giving her good news, she'll be happy.

2057
01:31:56,036 --> 01:31:57,333
我们明天去她家拜访
We're gonna go by her house tomorrow, too.

2058
01:31:58,539 --> 01:32:00,564
只是拜访她一下  我想去打个招呼
Yeah, we're just visiting her. I just want to say hi,

2059
01:32:00,674 --> 01:32:02,147
看看她在做什么  过得怎么样  
See how she's doing, where she lives,

2060
01:32:02,148 --> 01:32:02,856
诸如此类的
that kind of thing.

2061
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:05,378
你们当初为什么要分手呢
Why did you guys break up in the first place?

2062
01:32:06,113 --> 01:32:07,478
我背叛了她
I cheated on her.

2063
01:32:07,581 --> 01:32:09,412
为什么要背叛她
Why would you cheat on her?

2064
01:32:09,516 --> 01:32:11,709
你守身如玉是因为没人想搞你啊
It's easy not to cheat when no one wants to fuck you,

2065
01:32:11,709 --> 01:32:12,679
卫道士同志
You judgmental prick.

2066
01:32:12,786 --> 01:32:13,810
好吧
Okay.

2067
01:32:15,406 --> 01:32:16,981
关于汤姆・克鲁斯  
I have a theory that Tom Cruise,

2068
01:32:16,982 --> 01:32:18,669
大卫・贝克汉姆以及
David Beckham

2069
01:32:18,670 --> 01:32:20,469
威廉・史密斯我有一个想法
and Will Smith

2070
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:22,569
我认为他们曾经3P过
Have mooshed the heads of their penises together.

2071
01:32:24,882 --> 01:32:26,110
我觉得已经发生过了
I think that this has happened.

2072
01:32:26,217 --> 01:32:27,844
但我觉得他们3P不是因为同性恋
I don't think it happened in a gay way.

2073
01:32:27,952 --> 01:32:29,283
我觉得他们只是因为无聊
I think it just happened out of boredom.

2074
01:32:29,386 --> 01:32:31,354
有钱人的无聊
I think just rich-dude boredom.

2075
01:32:31,455 --> 01:32:33,305
类似于"我们还有什么没做的 
Just like, "what have we not done, guys?

2076
01:32:33,306 --> 01:32:34,891
所有的事我们都做过了"
we've done everything!"

2077
01:32:35,025 --> 01:32:37,493
"告诉你有一件事我们从未做过"
"i'll tell you one thing we haven't done. "

2078
01:32:37,595 --> 01:32:39,313
我敢说这事一定是做得
And I bet when it happened

2079
01:32:39,314 --> 01:32:41,031
波澜壮阔  场面宏大
It was an epic occurrence. it was huge.

2080
01:32:41,165 --> 01:32:42,257
我一直在想这个
I think of it all the time.

2081
01:32:42,366 --> 01:32:43,249
我猜刚开始的时候  
I think first, you know,

2082
01:32:43,250 --> 01:32:44,664
是大卫和汤姆的激烈缠绵
David and Tom touched dick heads.

2083
01:32:44,768 --> 01:32:46,156
这很容易
And it was easy, just zoonk.

2084
01:32:46,157 --> 01:32:48,932
毕竟有这么引人入胜的气氛
Because there was a magnetic field to it.

2085
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:50,902
然后汤姆提枪逼近
And then Will Smith started approaching with his dick

2086
01:32:51,008 --> 01:32:52,873
接着  微风拂过他的脸庞
And, like, wind started blowing in his face,

2087
01:32:52,977 --> 01:32:57,744
纸片四处飞舞  但他就是做不了
And paper started flying everywhere and he just couldn't do it.

2088
01:32:57,848 --> 01:32:59,440
另两人就说  "来吧  威尔  快点干吧"
And they're like, "come on, Will, get it in there!"

2089
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:00,915
"我做不到"
"i can't do it!"

2090
01:33:01,018 --> 01:33:01,985
贝克汉姆吼道
Beckham yells,

2091
01:33:02,086 --> 01:33:05,112
"看过捉鬼敢死队吗  开弓没有回头箭"
"don't cross the streams! it's like ghost busters!"

2092
01:33:05,389 --> 01:33:07,721
于是他干了  在皇后乐队的摇滚中熠熠生辉
And then he does it and flash by Queen starts playing.

2093
01:33:07,825 --> 01:33:09,190
熠熠生辉啊
It's just, flash! ahhh!

2094
01:33:09,593 --> 01:33:14,087
一道闪光射向天空  我想  明星都是这样出世的吧
Light shoots into the sky! that's how stars are born, I think.

2095
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:17,083
就这样  我是埃拉・莱基  
Anyway, I'm Ira Wright.

2096
01:33:17,084 --> 01:33:18,829
祝你们有个愉快的晚上  非常感谢
Have a good night. thank you, all, very much.

2097
01:33:25,843 --> 01:33:27,140

2098
01:33:27,244 --> 01:33:28,506
非常好
That was so good!

2099
01:33:29,246 --> 01:33:30,873
你好像很惊讶
You seem so surprised.

2100
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:32,141
因为你之前看起来很紧张
Well, you looked so nervous before.

2101
01:33:32,249 --> 01:33:33,375
实际上我就是很紧张
I was, actually.

2102
01:33:33,484 --> 01:33:34,508
你做得很好  真的很好
That was good. that was really good.

2103

2104

蛋蛋分离的那段  那段很搞笑
And the ball cleavage thing, that was hilarious.

2105
01:33:39,723 --> 01:33:41,686
相当经典  谢谢
Classic stuff. thank you.

2106

你开心就好
Glad you're having fun.

2107
01:33:45,629 --> 01:33:47,597
乔治说他认识你有一阵子了
George says that he's known you for a while. how did...

2108
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:49,529
-对  -你们是怎么认识的啊
- Yeah. - How did you guys first hook up?

2109
01:33:49,633 --> 01:33:51,095
我是即兴小剧场的衣帽间女服务员
I was the hat-check girl at the improv

2110
01:33:51,096 --> 01:33:52,101
曾经是个演员
and I was an actress.

2111
01:33:52,436 --> 01:33:53,562
-那你应该是  -对对
- So, you kind of... - yeah, yeah.

2112
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:54,537
那真好  
That's good.

2113
01:33:54,538 --> 01:33:56,765
你有没有在我听说过的电影中出演过
What were you in anything I might've seen?

2114
01:33:56,874 --> 01:33:59,152
我参演过一些  像是 
I did those, like,

2115
01:33:59,153 --> 01:34:01,607
新飞跃情海  还有90210
Melrose place and 90210.

2116
01:34:01,712 --> 01:34:02,679
真棒
Awesome.

2117
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:03,838
我总是演泼妇
I always played the bitch.

2118
01:34:03,947 --> 01:34:05,107
其实我并不是那么棒
I wasn't that good, actually.

2119
01:34:05,215 --> 01:34:06,512
不  你肯定是个超好的演员
No, you must be a great actress,

2120
01:34:06,617 --> 01:34:08,175
因为你本身一点都不像泼妇
'cause you're not at all bitchy, so...

2121
01:34:09,453 --> 01:34:10,511
谢谢  埃拉
Thanks, Ira.

2122
01:34:10,621 --> 01:34:13,364
你看  我  老实说  
Okay, look, I'm not... honestly,

2123
01:34:13,365 --> 01:34:15,422
我本不该告诉你这个
I'm not supposed to be telling you

2124
01:34:15,526 --> 01:34:16,424
我想说的是
What I'm about to tell you because George... 

2125
01:34:16,425 --> 01:34:18,222
乔治还不想说出去的事
he doesn't want to jinx it.

2126
01:34:18,329 --> 01:34:20,694
并不是百分百肯定  
It's not 100%,

2127
01:34:20,695 --> 01:34:22,629
但上次他去医生那里
But the last time that he went to the doctor,

2128
01:34:22,733 --> 01:34:25,128
医生说血液检查显示
They couldn't find any trace of the disease

2129
01:34:25,129 --> 01:34:26,726
他已经没病了
In his blood work anymore,

2130
01:34:26,837 --> 01:34:29,397
所以他可能痊愈了
So it seems like he might be better.

2131
01:34:29,506 --> 01:34:30,495
你说什么
What are you talking about?

2132
01:34:30,607 --> 01:34:31,835
女士们  先生们
Ladies and gentlemen...

2133
01:34:31,942 --> 01:34:33,273
我们认为他病好了
We think he might be okay.

2134
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:35,470

That's very nice. man, oh, man.

2143
01:35:10,214 --> 01:35:13,513
今晚有其他40岁的人在场吗  40多岁
Any other 40-year-olds out there tonight? in their 40s?

2144
01:35:13,617 --> 01:35:14,879
很有意思  我们20多岁时的状态是
It's funny. in your 20s you're like,

2145
01:35:14,985 --> 01:35:17,078
"操你的  伙计  操你个混蛋"
"fuck you, man. fuck that shit."

2146
01:35:17,187 --> 01:35:19,621
"操我老父老母  我才不想让他们管"
"fuck my parents. I don't need none of that shit. "

2147
01:35:19,723 --> 01:35:21,418
30多岁时的状态是  "操他妈总统
In your 30s you're like, "fuck the president.

2148
01:35:21,525 --> 01:35:23,857
"操他个混蛋  该死的衰人 "
"fuck that guy, that fucking asshole. "

2149
01:35:23,961 --> 01:35:26,191
而40多岁的状态却是  "我饿了 
In your 40s you're like, "I'm hungry.

2150
01:35:27,531 --> 01:35:29,522
"冰箱里有什么吃的吗"
"what do we have in the fridge?"

2151
01:35:32,603 --> 01:35:36,767
然后  我他妈的既出名又有钱  还很疯狂
So, yeah, I'm fucking famous and rich, and it's crazy.

2152
01:35:37,775 --> 01:35:40,039
知道为什么吗  因为我恨有钱人
It's... you know why? 'cause I hate rich people.

2153
01:35:40,144 --> 01:35:41,668
我他妈有钱又恨有钱人
Fucking I'm rich and I hate rich people.

2154
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:43,940
我恨自己做的每一件事
I hate everything I fucking do now.

2155
01:35:44,047 --> 01:35:45,139
只要去夏威夷  我就会想
I go to Hawaii, I'm like,

2156
01:35:45,249 --> 01:35:49,549
"你个天杀的狗杂种居然去夏威夷"
"You fucking snotty cocksucker, going to Hawaii. "

2157
01:35:50,154 --> 01:35:51,840
买辆新车后就会想
Buy a new car,

2158
01:35:51,841 --> 01:35:54,090
附庸风雅的家伙  还搞了辆新车
"La-di-da, look who's got a new car. "

2159
01:35:54,758 --> 01:35:58,159
我考虑过把我所有的钱捐出去
I thought about giving all my money, just giving it away,

2160
01:35:58,262 --> 01:36:01,527
但我又想  这可真是有钱人才干的事啊
But then I was like, "What a rich-guy thing to do.

2161
01:36:03,767 --> 01:36:05,394
好一"慈善先生"
"Mr. Charitable. "

2162
01:36:06,804 --> 01:36:09,204
我就在这啊  为什么不告诉我
Well, why didn't you tell me? I was just here.

2163
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:10,647
劳拉  如果我告诉你  
Laura, if I told you,

2164
01:36:10,648 --> 01:36:11,900
你可能再也不理我了  所以我
you might not have talked to me anymore, so I...

2165
01:36:12,009 --> 01:36:13,738
你在胡扯什么啊  太荒谬了
What are you talking about? that's ridiculous.

2166
01:36:13,844 --> 01:36:15,709
我知道你原谅我是因为我病了
I knew you forgave me because I was sick

2167
01:36:15,813 --> 01:36:17,576
否则你绝不会原谅我
And there was no other way you would forgive me.

2168
01:36:17,681 --> 01:36:18,978
我知道  但现在不一样了
I know, but it's different now.

2169
01:36:19,082 --> 01:36:21,346
我们已经言和了  你到底  不是这样
We've been talking... what are you... no!

2170
01:36:21,452 --> 01:36:22,419
真的吗
Really?

2171
01:36:25,055 --> 01:36:26,989
医生说我好了  目前为止我很好
The doctor said I'm good. I'm better for now.

2172
01:36:27,090 --> 01:36:28,387
虽然不知道以后会怎么样
I don't know what the hell's gonna happen,

2173
01:36:28,492 --> 01:36:29,481
但现在他说我好了
But for now the guy said I'm good.

2174
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,272
我太高兴了
I'm so happy.

2175
01:36:35,382 --> 01:36:36,576

01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,845
-得了  -好吧  好吧
- Come on. - okay, all right!

2226
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,313
我早上刚洗的头发
I just washed my hair this morning.

2227
01:38:50,417 --> 01:38:51,296
乔治  乔治
George! George!

2228
01:38:51,297 --> 01:38:52,078
乔治  乔治
George! George!

2229
01:38:54,354 --> 01:38:56,447
天哪
Oh, god!

2230
01:38:58,558 --> 01:38:59,547
不
No!

2231
01:38:59,659 --> 01:39:00,648
别别别
Just not the...

2232
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,727
看看这个
Look at this.

2233
01:39:01,828 --> 01:39:03,295
那可不是刚才的游戏
That's not the game!

2234
01:39:09,269 --> 01:39:12,864
我们与一个佛陀共有一个水池
And we have a pond with a buddha and...

2235
01:39:17,944 --> 01:39:19,309
痛吗
Does that hurt?

2236
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:22,210
谁是好人  你是好人  你是坏人吗
So, what, who is a good, you're a good guy, you're a bad guy?

2237
01:39:43,336 --> 01:39:46,999
该我走了
Now I go.

2238
01:39:47,107 --> 01:39:48,506
然后该我走
And now I go.

2239
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:50,744
你走不了  你被卡住了
You can't move. you're stuck.

2240
01:39:50,844 --> 01:39:51,833
埃拉
Ira.

2241
01:39:51,945 --> 01:39:54,641
劳拉问我们愿不愿意在这里吃晚饭
Hey, Laura asked if we want to eat dinner here tonight.

2242
01:39:55,415 --> 01:39:58,475
谢谢你  什么  我们
Oh. thank you. what... we...

2243
01:39:58,585 --> 01:39:59,711
回去要开八小时车呢
It's like an eight-hour drive back.

2244
01:39:59,819 --> 01:40:02,447
那样明早5点前都到不了家了
We won't get home till like 5:00 in the morning that way.

2245
01:40:02,556 --> 01:40:03,580
到时再说吧
We'll figure something out.

2246
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:05,846
那我们去杂货店
So, we're gonna go to the grocery store

2247
01:40:05,847 --> 01:40:07,387
买点菜来做
And get some food so I can cook.

2248
01:40:07,494 --> 01:40:09,359
家常菜  太好了
Home-cooked meal. perfect.

2249
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:11,293
那你来帮我看着孩子们  可以吗
Okay. so, you're okay to watch the girls?

2250
01:40:11,398 --> 01:40:13,093
当然  我很擅长和孩子玩
Yeah, definitely. I'm good with kids.

2251
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:16,101
我当了5年的犹太夏令营导员
I was a Jewish summer camp counselor for five years.

2252
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:20,071
当然和非犹太小孩也很合得来
But I'm good with non-jewish kids, too.

2253
01:40:20,173 --> 01:40:21,635
那好  我们很快就回来
Okay, so we'll be right back. 

2254
01:40:21,636 --> 01:40:22,471
商店就在拐角附近
It's around the corner.

2255
01:40:22,576 --> 01:40:23,873
很好
Very good.

2256
01:40:31,718 --> 01:40:34,551
我该穿上跑鞋吗  这是去哪儿
Should I have worn my jogging shoes? where are we going?

2257
01:40:46,766 --> 01:40:48,631
你确定  你确定要这样做吗
You sure? you sure you want to do this?

2258
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:50,659
不管我丈夫在哪儿
Wherever my husband is

2259
01:40:50,660 --> 01:40:51,667
他估计也在做同样的事情
He's probably doing the same thing.

2260
01:40:52,872 --> 01:40:53,930
好的
Okay.

2261
01:40:59,913 --> 01:41:01,471
有回声  回声  回声
Echo, echo, echo.

2262
01:41:06,386 --> 01:41:07,478
知道吗  和你分手后
You know, when I broke up with you,

2263
01:41:07,587 --> 01:41:11,489
我一直想去找一个和你截然不同的人
I tried to find somebody who was the exact opposite of you.

2264
01:41:14,127 --> 01:41:16,595
但是克拉克简直和你一模一样
But Clarke is exactly like you.

2265
01:41:18,098 --> 01:41:21,499
就像是命中注定的邂逅  遇到相似的人
It's like I'm programmed to find the same person,

2266
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:25,971
像是我逃不出去的宿命一般
Like there's some lesson I'm supposed to learn from it all.

2267
01:41:27,574 --> 01:41:30,042
你背叛了我几次?
How many times did you cheat on me?

2268
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:33,679
我不想回忆那段往事
I don't want to paint a picture.

2269
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:35,328
那时年少无知
I was young and stupid

2270
01:41:35,329 --> 01:41:37,910
但我现在已经改了  对天发誓
But I changed, I swear to god.

2271
01:41:39,185 --> 01:41:41,676
怎么改的
How exactly have you changed?

2272
01:41:41,821 --> 01:41:46,019
我看到了常人一生只能看到一次的东西
I got a peek at something most people only get to see once.

2273
01:41:48,161 --> 01:41:50,686
我去了一位灵媒那  她告诉我说
You know, I went to a psychic who told me that...

2274
01:41:50,797 --> 01:41:55,200
我们70岁的时候会重新走到一起
That you and I would get back together when we were 70.

2275
01:41:55,302 --> 01:41:57,702
她还说不要吃鸡肉
And she also said not to eat any chicken.

2276
01:41:58,438 --> 01:41:59,928
我们可等不了那么久
Well, we couldn't wait.

2277
01:42:01,441 --> 01:42:04,672
你是第一个爱我的人
You loved me before anybody loved me.

2278
01:42:04,778 --> 01:42:05,745
我知道
I know.

2279
01:42:11,484 --> 01:42:14,851
这是我唯一想要的归宿
This is the only place that I ever wanted to be.

2280
01:42:15,822 --> 01:42:18,313
乔治什么时候会死呢
When is George gonna die?

2281
01:42:18,425 --> 01:42:20,416
乔治会死吗
George is gonna die?

2282
01:42:22,462 --> 01:42:24,623
不会  为什么这么说
No. Why would you guys say that?

2283
01:42:24,731 --> 01:42:26,033
我听到妈妈哭着
I heard my mom talking to her friend on the phone

2284
01:42:26,034 --> 01:42:27,894
和她的一个朋友打电话
And she was crying.

2285
01:42:28,001 --> 01:42:29,764
我不想要乔治死
I don't want george to die.

2286
01:42:29,869 --> 01:42:31,496
你干吗这么关心  你才刚刚认识他
Why do you care? You just met him.

2287
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:32,593
闭嘴
Shut up.

2288
01:42:32,706 --> 01:42:34,571
-你闭嘴  -好好好  姑娘们
- You shut up!  - Okay, okay, guys, guys, guys.

2289
01:42:34,674 --> 01:42:36,073
乔治不会死的
George is not gonna die.

2290
01:42:36,176 --> 01:42:40,010
乔治  他不舒服  但是他去看了医生
George, he was sick, but he went to the doctor

2291
01:42:40,113 --> 01:42:41,637
医生给了他很多不同的药
And they gave him different types of medicine

2292
01:42:41,748 --> 01:42:43,215
其中一种很奏效
Until they found one that worked.

2293
01:42:43,316 --> 01:42:44,943
所以他会好起来的
And now he's gonna be just fine.

2294
01:42:45,051 --> 01:42:47,019
他会活很长很长时间
He's gonna live a really, really long time.

2295
01:42:47,253 --> 01:42:49,244
我觉得我妈妈爱他
I think my mommy loves him.

2296
01:42:50,423 --> 01:42:53,483
嗯...我们都爱他
Well, you know, we all love him.

2297
01:42:53,593 --> 01:42:55,060
他拍了很多很棒的电影
He's made a lot of great movies.

2298
01:42:55,161 --> 01:42:57,686
我觉得她爱他  是那种爱他
I think she loves him, like, loves him.

2299
01:42:57,797 --> 01:42:59,856
爱  爱  爱  爱
Love. love, love, love.

2300
01:42:59,966 --> 01:43:03,663
爱  爱  爱  他们会生个小孩
Love, love, love they're gonna have a baby

2301
01:43:03,903 --> 01:43:08,670
他们会生个小孩小孩  结婚  爱情
They're gonna have a baby baby, marriage, love

2302
01:43:09,409 --> 01:43:12,173
他们会生个人鱼小孩
They're gonna have a little merman baby.

2303
01:43:17,016 --> 01:43:18,943
你收藏了我演出的带子 
You saved my acting reel? 

2304
01:43:18,944 --> 01:43:20,679
我还纳闷他们去哪了
I was wondering where this was.

2305
01:43:20,787 --> 01:43:22,118
为什么不给我
Why didn't you give this to me?

2306
01:43:22,222 --> 01:43:23,484
因为我一直在看
cause I was watching it.

2307
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:24,453
知道吗
You know

2308
01:43:24,454 --> 01:43:26,354
我总是感觉你认为我很蠢
I always get the feeling that you think I'm stupid or something.

2309
01:43:26,459 --> 01:43:28,620
看我那头发  像妖精一样
Look at my hair! I look like a leprechaun.

2310
01:43:28,728 --> 01:43:29,820
不
No.

2311
01:43:29,929 --> 01:43:30,953
我是很蠢
I am stupid.

2312
01:43:31,064 --> 01:43:33,225
哦  我声音还那么高吗
Ooh! Is my voice still that high?

2313
01:43:33,333 --> 01:43:34,265
不不不...
No! no, no, no, no. no, 

2314
01:43:34,266 --> 01:43:36,598
不过人们一直想让你回孟克郡去
But they need you back in munchkinville.

2315
01:43:36,703 --> 01:43:38,364
他们怀念市长[讽刺声音很高]
They miss the mayor.

2316
01:43:38,471 --> 01:43:39,699
闭嘴
Shut up!

2317
01:43:40,106 --> 01:43:42,472
那是我最美好的时候
That was the best time in my life.

2318
01:43:42,942 --> 01:43:45,536
我还有东西给你  你应该还记得
I got something else for you. You might remember these.

2319
01:43:46,379 --> 01:43:48,506
告诉我你想要
Please tell me you do!

2320
01:43:49,416 --> 01:43:50,815
这不是我最爱的牛仔裤吗
Are these my favorite butt jeans?

2321
01:43:50,917 --> 01:43:52,282
对对对
Yes. yes. yes.

2322
01:43:52,419 --> 01:43:53,386

Really?

2323
01:43:53,486 --> 01:43:54,453
是  它重回你的怀抱了
Yeah, you can have them back.

2324
01:43:54,554 --> 01:43:55,816
太激动了  
I'm so excited! yeah.

2325
01:43:55,922 --> 01:43:57,389
你觉得它还合我身吗
Do you think they still fit me?

2326
01:43:57,490 --> 01:43:58,479
我保证
I guarantee it.

我保证  穿上它
I guarantee it.  Get in those.

2329
01:44:02,495 --> 01:44:03,269
这家伙把我魂都勾走了  
These used to kill me. 

2330
01:44:03,270 --> 01:44:04,326
天哪  褪色这么严重
Oh, my god, they're so faded.

2331
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:05,921
该死
Oh, shit!

2332
01:44:06,032 --> 01:44:07,021
很合身
They fit!

2333
01:44:07,133 --> 01:44:08,498
-看上去美极了  -真的吗
- They look good!  - Really?

2334
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:10,125
是啊  美臀依旧
Yeah, that's the same ass!

2335
01:44:10,236 --> 01:44:14,297
太美了  除了后面那个商标
Fucking ass is perfect. Minus that camel coming out the back.

2336
01:44:14,407 --> 01:44:16,534
前顶  再后翘
Bump and groove it

2337
01:44:16,643 --> 01:44:19,407
向左  再向右
To the left now to the right, y'all

2338
01:44:19,512 --> 01:44:20,479
拍拍屁股
Slap that shit!

2339
01:44:22,982 --> 01:44:25,109
你看啊  像老妈牛仔裤一样
Look at that! they're like mom jeans.

2340
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:28,745
是啊  如果老妈想再重温激情的话
Oh, yes. if mom needed to get banged again.

2341
01:44:28,855 --> 01:44:29,822
谢谢
Thank you.

2342
01:44:29,923 --> 01:44:31,288
过来
Yeah, get over here.

2343
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,819
别离开我  别离开我
Don't leave me. Don't leave me.

2344
01:44:43,403 --> 01:44:45,997
嘿  伙计们  怎么花了这么长时间
Oh! hey, guys, what took you so long?

2345
01:44:46,105 --> 01:44:48,596
我们游览了一下城镇风光  伙计  太漂亮了
We were checking out the town, man. beautiful!

2346
01:44:48,708 --> 01:44:49,834
吃的买到哪去了
Where are the groceries?

2347
01:44:49,943 --> 01:44:53,003
我们改变主意了  叫外卖更好玩
We decided that eating in might be more fun.

2348
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,648
哦  你该不会是
Oh, no, you didn't.

2349
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:57,682
你怎么能这么做
How could you do that, man? No

2350
01:44:58,017 --> 01:44:59,882
我什么也没做  埃拉
I didn't do anything, Ira.

2351
01:44:59,986 --> 01:45:01,613
不  我知道你做了  你肯定做了
No, I know you did it. I know you did.

2352
01:45:01,754 --> 01:45:04,120
就差手上拿支冰棍了  拜托
All that's missing is your popsicle. come on.

2353
01:45:04,224 --> 01:45:06,055
埃拉  你现在是不是饿得慌
Ira, are you cranky right now?

2354
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:07,353
想吃点东西吗
Do you need food in your belly?

2355
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,427
不
No

2356
01:45:08,528 --> 01:45:09,344
来  我们订个匹萨
Come on, we're gonna order in a pizza.

2357
01:45:10,797 --> 01:45:13,857
当然  皮特先生
Of course, Mr. Peters.

2358
01:45:13,967 --> 01:45:14,934
我会去
I'll be at the...

2359
01:45:16,269 --> 01:45:17,566
午宴的
Lunch meeting.

2360
01:45:18,605 --> 01:45:20,903
你们有准备海鲜吗
You're serving seafood?

2361
01:45:23,543 --> 01:45:25,408
我爱海鲜
I love seafood!

2362
01:45:26,079 --> 01:45:27,842
到时见
Okay, see you there!

2363
01:45:29,983 --> 01:45:31,473
匹萨来了  
Pizza's here! Yeah.

2364
01:45:31,584 --> 01:45:32,983
-我很快就回来  -好的
- I'll be right back.  - yes.

2365
01:45:33,086 --> 01:45:34,781
我是匹萨终结者
I'm the pizza monster!

2366
01:45:38,691 --> 01:45:40,659
嗨  亲爱的
Hi, honey!

2367
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,325
-克拉克  -嗨  亲爱的
- Clarke. - Hi, sweetie.

2368
01:45:42,428 --> 01:45:44,623
嗨  你怎么回来了
Hi. What are you doing here?

2369
01:45:44,731 --> 01:45:46,426
给你一个惊喜
Decided to surprise you.

2370
01:45:46,533 --> 01:45:47,915
开欢迎会的时候
The guy I was meant to have the meeting with

2371
01:45:47,916 --> 01:45:49,297
要跟我开会的那个人
Had a heart attack

2372
01:45:49,402 --> 01:45:50,664
突发心脏病
While I was waiting in reception for him.

2373
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:52,203
难以置信
It was unbelievable.

2374
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:53,932
然后  这个中国乔治・克鲁尼先生
Next minute, this chinese George Clooney guy

2375
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,302
跑过来拿着那个
Comes running past with, like, the...

2376
01:45:55,875 --> 01:45:57,103
叫什么来着  除颤器吗
What's it called? a defibrillator?

2377
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:58,507
电他  我亲眼所见
Starts zapping him. Right. Yeah, I've seen it.

2378
01:45:58,645 --> 01:46:00,977
就像是中国版的急诊室故事一样
It was like an episode of ER, but with chinamen.

2379
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:03,071
我想你
I missed you.

2380
01:46:08,187 --> 01:46:09,154
我知道你
I know you.

2381
01:46:09,255 --> 01:46:09,887
好
Yes.

2382
01:46:11,858 --> 01:46:13,052
近来如何
How you doing?

2383
01:46:13,693 --> 01:46:14,955
这是乔治・西蒙斯
This is George Simmons.

2384
01:46:15,061 --> 01:46:16,585
他昨晚举办了一场喜剧音乐会
He had a big comedy concert last night.

2385
01:46:16,696 --> 01:46:17,663
哦  挺好的
Oh, okay.

2386
01:46:17,931 --> 01:46:20,729
所以  我邀请他来家做客
And so, I asked him to pop by and come visit.

2387
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:23,525
希望没有冒犯...
Hope that's good. i...

2388
01:46:23,636 --> 01:46:25,103
我喜欢单口喜剧
I love the stand-up comedy.

2389
01:46:25,438 --> 01:46:27,030
反响怎么样
How'd it go?

2390
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:30,103
这次意外的他们没有
They didn't... 

2391
01:46:30,104 --> 01:46:31,338
把我嘘下场
They didn't boo me off the stage, so that was a plus.

2392
01:46:31,444 --> 01:46:34,607
是啊  他们就是一群捣蛋鬼
Yeah, they're a bunch of bloody cheese eaters up here.

2393
01:46:34,714 --> 01:46:36,443
不  他们都挺友善的
Yeah. no, they were very nice. yeah.

2394
01:46:36,549 --> 01:46:39,040
你有个幸福的家庭
You have a... you have a very nice family, man,

2395
01:46:39,152 --> 01:46:40,619
漂亮的房子
And a great, great home.

2396
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,153
谢谢
Thank you.

2397
01:46:42,255 --> 01:46:43,654
很高兴你回家了
Well, it's good to have you home.

2398
01:46:43,756 --> 01:46:45,280
孩子们都很想见你...
The kids are dying to see you if...

2399
01:46:45,391 --> 01:46:48,292
埃拉饿了...
Ira's hungry for...

2400
01:46:48,394 --> 01:46:49,383
你好  我是克拉克
G'day. Clarke.

2401
01:46:49,495 --> 01:46:51,156
你好  我是埃拉
Good day, I'm Ira.

2402
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,822
-你老公回来了  -对
- Your husband's here.  - yeah. yep.

2403
01:46:52,932 --> 01:46:56,390
埃拉是乔治的热场助手  他很幽默
Ira is George's opening act. He's really funny.

2404
01:46:56,502 --> 01:46:58,333
真的吗  他长得就很幽默
Really? he looks funny!

2405
01:46:59,305 --> 01:47:00,272
谢谢
Thank you.

2406
01:47:00,373 --> 01:47:01,806
你昨晚表现怎样
How'd you go last night?

2407
01:47:01,908 --> 01:47:04,433
他们没有把我嘘下场...
You know, they didn't boo me off or anything, so...

2408
01:47:04,544 --> 01:47:05,875
我已经这样说过了
I just said that one.

2409
01:47:05,979 --> 01:47:07,776
昨晚很棒
It was great. yeah.

2410
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:08,925
他们只是来玩一下
They just popped by

2411
01:47:08,926 --> 01:47:10,075
我带他们参观了一下房子
I gave them a tour of the house.

2412
01:47:10,183 --> 01:47:11,878
我们正准备吃晚餐  但...
We were gonna have dinner, but it's not...

2413
01:47:11,985 --> 01:47:14,044
还是一起来个家庭聚餐吧
It's probably better that we do family dinner

2414
01:47:14,153 --> 01:47:15,279
鉴于你只在这呆几天
Since you're only in town a few days.

2415
01:47:15,388 --> 01:47:16,446
别别别  住下来吧  很棒的主意
No no no, stay. That's a great idea.

2416
01:47:16,556 --> 01:47:17,750
越久越好
The more the merrier.

2417
01:47:17,857 --> 01:47:19,017
那好  就这样定了
Okay. Let's do that.

2418
01:47:19,325 --> 01:47:20,815
-谢谢  -太好了
- Thank you.  - Great.

2419
01:47:20,927 --> 01:47:21,894
我得和孩子们打个招呼
I'm gonna go say hi to the kids.

2420
01:47:21,995 --> 01:47:23,462
好的
Okay. okay.

2421
01:47:23,563 --> 01:47:25,030
真是太有趣了
That's hilarious.

2422
01:47:25,131 --> 01:47:27,326
你不能告诉他你好了  知道吗
You can't tell him that you're better, okay?

2423
01:47:27,433 --> 01:47:29,697
不然他会发现我们之间有隐情的
He'll know that something happened between us.

2424
01:47:29,802 --> 01:47:30,860
我不会的
I won't.

2425
01:47:30,970 --> 01:47:33,268
因为我已经结婚12年了而且有孩子
'cause I've been married for 12 years now and I have kids.

2426
01:47:33,373 --> 01:47:35,603
不能说放手就放手  知道吗
And I can't just throw it away this second, okay?

2427
01:47:35,875 --> 01:47:40,141
嘿  不会有事的  我们都是好演员
Hey, we'll be fine. I'm a good actor. you're a great actress.

2428
01:47:40,246 --> 01:47:40,844
对
Right. 

2429
01:47:40,845 --> 01:47:43,238
直到知道你得病之后他才不那么恨你
He hated you until he found out that you were sick.

2430
01:47:43,349 --> 01:47:45,166
如果他知道你好转了
And if he knows that you were here 

2431
01:47:45,167 --> 01:47:46,378
还在这里的话
And that you're feeling better,

2432
01:47:46,378 --> 01:47:47,217
他会发现的
He's gonna know.

2433
01:47:47,353 --> 01:47:48,411
所以  什么都别说
So, don't say anything.

2434
01:47:48,521 --> 01:47:49,920
好的 
Okay, yeah, yeah.

2435
01:47:50,023 --> 01:47:51,786
当然  我不会说的
Of course. sure. I'll do that.

2436
01:47:52,392 --> 01:47:53,128
大家都没想到
People never thought 

2437
01:47:53,129 --> 01:47:54,724
中国会和美国做这么多的生意
China would do that much business with the us,

2438
01:47:54,827 --> 01:47:57,352
但我觉得这没什么大不了的  这样想想
But I never saw it as a big deal. You look at it like this.

2439
01:47:57,463 --> 01:47:58,555
他们有十几亿的人口
You've got a billion people.

2440
01:47:58,665 --> 01:48:00,132
我们生产这么多靓货
We make all kinds of cool shit.

2441
01:48:00,233 --> 01:48:02,428
然后他们从网上知道这些靓货
They find out about the cool shit on the internet and stuff.

2442
01:48:02,535 --> 01:48:03,502
于是便想要这些靓货 
And they're gonna want the cool shit.

2443
01:48:03,603 --> 01:48:05,366
靓货靓遍全宇宙
Cool shit's universal.

2444
01:48:05,471 --> 01:48:07,701
中国还挺不错的 但我正在努力进军朝鲜
China's been good, but I'm trying to get north Korea.

2445
01:48:07,807 --> 01:48:08,580
这是我的  算是下一个标的
That's the next... that's, like, the next frontier.

2446
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:11,171
-朝鲜吗  -对朝鲜
- North Korea? - North Korea.

2447
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:12,623
只引进任天堂他们都会感激涕零了 
Those people would blow you for a wii fit.

2448
01:48:13,846 --> 01:48:15,040
说的好 
There you go.

2449
01:48:15,148 --> 01:48:16,911
匹萨真的挺好的 
This is really good pizza.

2450
01:48:17,016 --> 01:48:18,779
他们说  纽约的匹萨最好吃
You know, they say, like, New York has the best pizza

2451
01:48:18,885 --> 01:48:20,750
我之前觉得洛杉矶的匹萨也还不错
And I always thought  pizza in LA was only okay

2452
01:48:20,853 --> 01:48:21,877
但谁会料到
But who would have thought, you know,

2453
01:48:21,988 --> 01:48:23,145
马林郡的匹萨
Marin county is where 

2454
01:48:23,146 --> 01:48:24,303
才是最好吃的
They were really hiding the good pizza pies

2455
01:48:32,565 --> 01:48:34,465
克拉克的中文很流利 
Clarke speaks fluent Chinese.

2456
01:48:34,567 --> 01:48:37,468
真的吗  是说粤语还是普通话 
Really? Do you speak Cantonese or Mandarin?

2457
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:39,800
哦 问得好 埃拉 普通话
Oh, well played, Ira. Mandarin.

2458
01:48:39,906 --> 01:48:41,601
满足了 埃拉 
Well gayed, Ira.

2459
01:48:41,708 --> 01:48:44,176
一种很难的语言 乔治 天哪
It's a bloody hard language, though, george. jesus.

2460
01:49:01,461 --> 01:49:03,292
这看起来像猎鹿人里面的场景
That was like a scene from deer hunter.

2461
01:49:06,599 --> 01:49:08,863
孩子们  你们去看电视吧 
Girls, you can go and watch tv.

2462
01:49:09,502 --> 01:49:12,164
去吧  想看什么就看什么 
Go on. Whatever you want to watch.

2463
01:49:13,272 --> 01:49:16,298
那么  乔治  病情怎样了 
So, George, how's the fight going, mate?

2464
01:49:16,409 --> 01:49:17,376
怎么样
How is it?

2465
01:49:17,477 --> 01:49:18,263
克拉克 
Clarke. 

2466
01:49:18,264 --> 01:49:19,836
他现在不想说这个
This is not something that he wants to talk about right now.

2467
01:49:22,081 --> 01:49:25,482
病痛每时每刻都困扰着他
He has to think about it every day of his life.

2468
01:49:25,585 --> 01:49:28,418
而他正在试着解脱 
And he's taking a break from it right now.

2469
01:49:28,521 --> 01:49:31,951
让一个带给我们这么多欢乐的人 
It's such a shame that somebody who has brought so much joy

2470
01:49:35,394 --> 01:49:38,090
来经历这一切真是太不公平了 
To so many people has to go through this.

2471
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:41,864
该死 该死
Shit. shit.

2472
01:49:41,968 --> 01:49:42,957
对不起 伙计
I'm sorry, mate.

2473
01:49:43,069 --> 01:49:47,096
劳拉 我们不用说得这么晦涩
Laura. Laura. we don't need to speak in code.

2474
01:49:47,206 --> 01:49:49,333
我病了 我每天都在担忧这个 
I'm sick. I think about it all the time.

2475
01:49:49,442 --> 01:49:50,670
伙计  我真的不知道是怎么做到的
Mate, I don't know how you do it.

2476
01:49:50,777 --> 01:49:52,147
换是我的话估计都哭到歇斯底里了 
I would be crying in my panties if I was you.

2477
01:49:53,412 --> 01:49:55,403
我崇拜像你这样的人 这种态度
I worship guys like you, that attitude.

2478
01:49:55,515 --> 01:49:56,982
你有没有试过草药
Have you considered eastern medicine?

2479
01:49:57,083 --> 01:49:58,459
恩 我不知道这是不是中药
Well, I don't know if this is considered eastern medicine

2480
01:50:00,019 --> 01:50:02,112
但我吃了很多的犀牛鞭
But I've been eating a lot of rhino cock.

2481
01:50:02,221 --> 01:50:03,392
如果你觉得这有用的话 
If Clarke thinks it's the right thing to do

2482
01:50:03,393 --> 01:50:04,138
那我就再多吃一点
Let me chew some.

2483
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:08,093
最后一次警告 不要叫我犀牛了 
For the last time, stop calling me rhino.

2484
01:50:11,264 --> 01:50:13,061
乔治・西蒙斯在我的家里
George Simmons in my house!

2485
01:50:13,166 --> 01:50:14,306
克拉克曾经吃过草药
Clarke took an herb once

2486
01:50:14,307 --> 01:50:15,219
他那时候有些心悸腹泻
And he had heart palpitations and diarrhea.

2487
01:50:17,370 --> 01:50:17,764
这是真的  我大便失禁了
No, it's true. I shit myself, mate

2488
01:50:18,905 --> 01:50:19,475
而且老二还是勃起的
And I had a boner at the same time.

2489
01:50:22,942 --> 01:50:24,135
我想吃些让我变得和你一样帅气的草药
I want to take an herb that makes me as good-looking as you.

2490
01:50:25,344 --> 01:50:26,936
老天爷
Jesus christ!

2491
01:50:27,046 --> 01:50:28,110
如果我是你 我整天都得干自己
If I were you I'd be at home all day fucking myself.

2492
01:50:29,348 --> 01:50:30,315
我就是那样做的
That's what I do!

2493
01:50:32,185 --> 01:50:34,380
好啦好啦  我们在吃饭呢
All right! All right! We're cooking.

2494
01:50:34,821 --> 01:50:36,345
他真幽默
He's really funny.

2495
01:50:36,589 --> 01:50:37,409
但为什么他的电影一点都不好笑呢
I don't know why his movies aren't funny, though.

2496
01:50:38,291 --> 01:50:39,781
很怪  不是吗
That's weird, isn't it?

2497
01:50:39,892 --> 01:50:40,685
他应该在银幕上多表演些这样的
He should put some of that on the silver screen.

2498
01:50:41,494 --> 01:50:42,756
那么 就一杯 好吗
So, just one drink, okay?

2499
01:50:42,862 --> 01:50:44,161
我不想和他这样长时间耗下去
This isn't someone I want to spend a lot of time with.

2500
01:50:45,531 --> 01:50:47,431
他吗  澳大利亚版的我
This? This is the Australian me?

2501
01:50:47,533 --> 01:50:49,160
我比这个蠢蛋强多了
I'm so much better than this fucking idiot.

2502
01:50:49,268 --> 01:50:50,496
他看上去挺棒的
He seems like the nicest guy, ever.

2503
01:50:50,603 --> 01:50:51,529
他还劝你用草药治病
He's trying to cure you with herbs for god's sakes.

2504
01:50:52,505 --> 01:50:53,534
我不能这样丢下她 我得救她
I can't leave her alone here. I have to save her.

2505
01:50:54,674 --> 01:50:55,715
把她从漂亮的房子和可爱的老公
Save her from her beautiful house and lovely husband

2506
01:50:56,809 --> 01:50:57,935
还有可人的孩子那抢过来吗
And delightful kids?

2507
01:50:58,044 --> 01:50:59,602
她丈夫是个瞒着她劈腿的神经病
Her husband's a skipping, cheating psycho.

2508
01:50:59,712 --> 01:51:01,236
你说你们两个没发生什么
You said nothing was going on between you two.

2509
01:51:01,347 --> 01:51:03,212
连狗都知道你搞过她了
The dog could tell that you banged her.

2510
01:51:03,316 --> 01:51:03,939
我现在觉得心悸恶心 我不能
And I'm getting nauseous and sweaty. I can't...

2511
01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:06,158
从我面前消失 和孩子们玩去 
Get away from me! get away from me! go play with the kids.

2512
01:51:09,889 --> 01:51:12,517
蒂姆 你是约我出去吗
Tim, are you asking me out on a date?

2513
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:14,058
你想这是个约会吗
Would you like it to be a date?

2514
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:15,957
嘿 兄弟 你医生打电话说
Hey, bro, so your doctor called

2515
01:51:16,062 --> 01:51:16,617
这是传染的
And he said it is contagious

2516
01:51:16,618 --> 01:51:17,915
只有发炎之后 你才会冷静下来
But only when inflamed, so you're cool.

2517
01:51:20,566 --> 01:51:21,999
还有 我想把衣服洗了
Also, I was trying to do the laundry,

2518
01:51:22,101 --> 01:51:23,284
但我觉得你应该买些功效超强的洗涤剂
But I think I need to get some industrial-strength detergent.

2519
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:26,936
你内裤上黄色的东西是什么  年轻人
What's up with all the skid marks, Dale Earnhardt, Jr.?

2520
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:29,667
我要上课了
Wow, I think I have a class.

2521
01:51:29,775 --> 01:51:31,072
你们喜欢这部剧吗
You guys like this show?

2522
01:51:31,177 --> 01:51:32,303
不喜欢
No!

2523
01:51:32,411 --> 01:51:34,504
这是我看过最烂的剧
It's the worst show, ever.

2524
01:51:34,614 --> 01:51:35,581
没错
Good.

2525
01:51:36,382 --> 01:51:38,316
给你  喝够了法国劣质品
Here you go. We're finished with the French shit.

2526
01:51:38,417 --> 01:51:39,975
来尝尝西班牙口味的
We're into Espanola!

2527
01:51:40,086 --> 01:51:41,610
好的
All right.

2528
01:51:42,455 --> 01:51:44,116
在中国  老兄
China, man.

2529
01:51:44,223 --> 01:51:46,987
你们见不到对方  日子一定很难过
And you guys never see each other, huh? That must be rough.

2530
01:51:47,093 --> 01:51:48,253
对吧  特别是对于孩子们
Right? Rough on the kids.

2531
01:51:48,361 --> 01:51:51,524
虽然不算理想  但孩子们很贪吃  所以
It's not ideal, but the kids like to eat, so...

2532
01:51:53,266 --> 01:51:56,135
你有看过你妻子演戏吗  她演的很棒
You ever see this girl act before? She was quite the actress.

2533
01:51:56,302 --> 01:51:58,167
是呀  她很擅长装作她还爱我
Well, she's very good at pretending she still loves me,

2534
01:51:58,271 --> 01:51:59,863
演的真好  是吧
So she's pretty good then, isn't she?

2535
01:51:59,972 --> 01:52:01,530
对  确实
Yeah. I am.

2536
01:52:02,708 --> 01:52:05,643
虽然我没看过多少飞越情海
Can't say I watched much of that Melrose Place stuff, though.

2537
01:52:05,745 --> 01:52:07,440
但我看过你演的几集五口之家
Although I did see the Party of Five episode you were in.

2538
01:52:07,546 --> 01:52:09,514
不是很合我的口味
It wasn't really for me, you know.

2539
01:52:09,715 --> 01:52:12,582
跟变相怪杰的主演比起来
Well, it was down to me and Cameron Diaz 

2540
01:52:12,582 --> 01:52:14,709
我和卡梅隆・迪亚兹都很烂
For the lead part in The Mask.

2541
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:16,913
卡梅隆・迪亚兹  我的女神
Cameron Diaz! That's my girl.

2542
01:52:17,023 --> 01:52:18,991
她是当红花旦  对吧
She's a bloody top actress, isn't she?

2543
01:52:19,091 --> 01:52:20,626
她头发上沾着精液的
Hey, what was that film she was in 

2544
01:52:20,627 --> 01:52:21,821
那部电影叫什么
With the bloody spuff in her hair?

2545
01:52:21,994 --> 01:52:23,120
《我为玛丽狂》
Something about Mary!

2546
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:27,231
我爱那部电影  她演的超棒
I love that movie! She's so funny!

2547
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:29,130
笑得我差点尿裤子
Just about shit my panties in that one.

2548
01:52:29,335 --> 01:52:30,495
这种女演员不多见
No, no, no, there's not too many girls

2549
01:52:30,603 --> 01:52:34,130
既漂亮  又性感  还很幽默
That are this beautiful and sexy and funny and...

2550
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:35,502
但她都兼备了
She had the whole deal.

2551
01:52:35,608 --> 01:52:41,012
是呀  卡梅隆・迪亚兹就是这样  是吧
Yes, but Cameron Diaz, fuck! I mean, come on.

2552
01:52:42,214 --> 01:52:43,272
要是你去拍了那部电影
See, if you had've done that movie,

2553
01:52:43,382 --> 01:52:44,906
你头发上就也有精液了
You could have had the bloody spuff in your hair.

2554
01:52:45,017 --> 01:52:45,563
小心言辞
Look out.

2555
01:52:45,563 --> 01:52:47,132
你这么瞪着我干吗
What are you giving me the evil eyes for?

2556
01:52:47,132 --> 01:52:48,279
有时候你真混蛋
You're such a dick sometimes.

2557
01:52:48,387 --> 01:52:49,445
我没有  为什么
I'm not... Why?

2558
01:52:49,555 --> 01:52:50,544
因为
Because.

2559
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:53,523
我只是说你有你的风格但固执不前
I'm just saying you had your crack, you had your goal at it.

2560
01:52:53,626 --> 01:52:55,457
我觉得我还有潜力
I feel like I didn't reach my potential that...

2561
01:52:55,561 --> 01:52:56,823
行了吧
Oh, please!

2562
01:52:56,929 --> 01:52:57,896
什么行了吧
Oh, please, what?

2563
01:52:57,997 --> 01:52:59,123
我也还有潜力
I didn't reach my potential, either!

2564
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:00,528
我本来能踢澳足的
I could have been playing footie!

2565
01:53:00,633 --> 01:53:01,622
你踢球根本
You weren't that good

2566
01:53:01,734 --> 01:53:02,860
-没那么厉害  -厉害的
- At playing footie. - I was.

2567
01:53:02,969 --> 01:53:03,936
不厉害
You weren't.

2568
01:53:04,937 --> 01:53:05,960
你该感谢我  乔治
You should thank me, George. 

2569
01:53:05,960 --> 01:53:08,338
帮你挡下了这个祸害
I took a bullet here for you.

2570
01:53:08,441 --> 01:53:11,376
好了  是时间了  我该回洛杉矶了
All right, on that note, I'm gonna head back to Los Angeles.

2571
01:53:11,477 --> 01:53:12,466
别走啊  多留几天
No, come on, stay.

2572
01:53:12,578 --> 01:53:13,545
不了  我要走了
No, it's fine. I'll split.

2573
01:53:13,646 --> 01:53:14,670
-现在还早  -我在这耽搁很久了
- It's early. - I've been here too long.

2574
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:15,974
-史麦拉  -这才喝第一瓶
- Schmira! - We just started a bottle.

2575
01:53:16,082 --> 01:53:18,949
别别  你已经待我够好了  史麦拉
Nah, nah, nah. You guys have been the best. Schmira!

2576
01:53:19,051 --> 01:53:21,611
非常感谢你们的款待
Thank you so much for having us, guys.

2577
01:53:21,754 --> 01:53:23,415
-倒霉  -当心
- Shoot. - Uh-oh! Look out.

2578
01:53:23,522 --> 01:53:24,489
天哪  真对不起  伙计
God, I'm sorry, guys.

2579
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:25,557
看来有人喝多了
Someone's had too much to drink.

2580
01:53:25,691 --> 01:53:28,683
不  老兄  我只是不小心踢倒了酒瓶
Man, no. No, I just kicked your pot by accident, that's all. I...

2581
01:53:29,028 --> 01:53:30,464
把碎片拨到一块儿去  史麦拉
Hold it together there, Schmira. I'm just a... 

2582
01:53:30,465 --> 01:53:31,752
-天哪  -没关系的
- Oh, god. - It's okay.

2583
01:53:31,752 --> 01:53:33,224
住在这里吧  你不能开车
You're staying here. You're not driving.

2584
01:53:33,332 --> 01:53:35,926
绝对不能开  我们有间客房  两张空床
No way. We got a guest house, two spare beds. Done.

2585
01:53:36,035 --> 01:53:37,627
-你们两人住没问题  -不了  埃拉能开车
- You two, plenty of room to stay. - No, no. Ira can drive.

2586
01:53:37,737 --> 01:53:39,102
他  你能开车吧  埃拉
He... You're fine to drive, right, Ira?

2587
01:53:39,205 --> 01:53:41,337
-我踢翻了酒瓶而已  -没门
- I am. I just kicked your begonias, that's all. - No way!

2588
01:53:41,337 --> 01:53:42,502
我不会让全美滑稽人物
I'm not having America's favorite funnyman 

2589
01:53:42,503 --> 01:53:44,133
就因为史麦拉酒后驾车
Dead on the side of the road

2590
01:53:44,243 --> 01:53:45,801
而曝尸路旁的
'Cause Schmira here's had too much to drink.

2591
01:53:45,911 --> 01:53:47,037
乔治  你能开车吧
George, you can drive, right?

2592
01:53:47,146 --> 01:53:49,171
狗屁  你们都得留下
Bullshit! You're staying here.

2593
01:53:49,315 --> 01:53:52,876
另外  今晚还有澳式足球赛
Plus, there's a game of Aussie-rules footie on the dish tonight.

2594
01:53:52,985 --> 01:53:54,350
半决赛  圣士对抗马基
Semi-final. Saints versus Maggies.

2595
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:56,614
不是美式垃圾足球  看看吧
Not that American shit. I want you to see it.

2596
01:53:56,722 --> 01:53:59,748
有个条件  你们澳洲小子看球时有酒喝吗
One condition. You Aussie pussies got any beer around here?

2597
01:53:59,859 --> 01:54:01,486
有  准备好了
Yes, it's on...

2598
01:54:02,862 --> 01:54:03,886
帅气
Yes!

2599
01:54:04,497 --> 01:54:06,488
不论你是大混蛋还是小混蛋
Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're a small fucker or a big fucker,

2600
01:54:06,599 --> 01:54:07,799
都能参加这种球赛  
You can play this game 

2601
01:54:07,800 --> 01:54:08,760
因为小混蛋跑的快
Because the small fuckers go in barreling

2602
01:54:08,868 --> 01:54:10,699
还能从一团乱麻里把球捞出来
And they can get the ball over and the boys are scrambling.

2603
01:54:10,803 --> 01:54:12,100
看这里  小混蛋开始跑动
Now watch. The little fuckers down there go.

2604
01:54:12,204 --> 01:54:14,138
到这里  大混蛋撞他们
There they are. Big fuckers smack them.

2605
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,674
小混蛋  小混蛋  传给大混蛋
Little fucker. Little fucker. Off to a big fucker.

2606
01:54:16,776 --> 01:54:18,933
他又传给另一个大混蛋  
Now he's gonna go down to another big fucker. 

2607
01:54:18,934 --> 01:54:20,371
我讨厌那个大混蛋
I hate that big fucker.

2608
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:21,446
黑人在哪里
Where are the black guys?

2609
01:54:21,547 --> 01:54:22,980
外围有两个黑人
This is... There's a couple out there.

2610
01:54:23,082 --> 01:54:24,481
-我讨厌这个队  -是吗
- I hate this team. - Oh, yeah?

2611
01:54:24,583 --> 01:54:26,050
马基  恨死马基了
Magpies. Hate the Maggies!

2612
01:54:26,152 --> 01:54:30,088
就像是  我不知道美式足球的规定
They're like... I don't know what the equivalent in the NFL...

2613
01:54:30,256 --> 01:54:34,693
不带头盔  把头盔丢掉才是男子汉
No helmets. No fucking helmets 'cause they're real men. See?

2614
01:54:34,794 --> 01:54:38,252
我爱你  我在给他们做解说  他们很爱看
Love you. Just explaining the game to them. They're loving it!

2615
01:54:46,272 --> 01:54:47,762
好了  我们要走了
Yeah, we gotta get going, you know.

2616
01:54:47,873 --> 01:54:49,841
真的不多留几天吗
Are you sure you can't stay?

2617
01:54:49,942 --> 01:54:51,500
不了  不打扰了
We can't stay. We can't stay.

2618
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:54,579
是呀  我奶奶的85岁大寿要到了
Yeah, it's my... It's my grandmother's 85th birthday.

2619
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:56,715
所有亲戚都要从四面八方赶回去
We got family coming in from all over.

2620
01:54:56,816 --> 01:54:59,307
她中风了  腿脚不能动
She just had a stroke. In her leg.

2621
01:54:59,418 --> 01:55:00,680
所以  我们要赶回去
So, you know, we gotta get back.

2622
01:55:00,786 --> 01:55:01,753
是呀
Yeah.

2623
01:55:01,854 --> 01:55:03,481
那真是太遗憾了
That's too bad you guys can't stay.

2624
01:55:03,589 --> 01:55:04,886
是很遗憾
It is too bad.

2625
01:55:05,091 --> 01:55:07,423
但愿还能再见到你  乔治
Well, I wish I could say I was gonna see you again, George,

2626
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:09,460
但也不好说  是吧
But I can't really say that, can I?

2627
01:55:09,562 --> 01:55:11,860
对  对  说不准
Yeah, yeah, I guess you can't.

2628
01:55:11,964 --> 01:55:12,931
亲爱的  不用勉强自己
You don't have to do that, honey.

2629
01:55:13,032 --> 01:55:15,330
不  亲爱的  我要说
No, I do have to do this, honey. I do.

2630
01:55:15,434 --> 01:55:16,560
知道吗  老兄
You know what, mate?

2631
01:55:16,669 --> 01:55:17,791
我从中国的
If there's one thing I've learned 

2632
01:55:17,792 --> 01:55:20,036
佛教徒朋友那学到一点
From my Buddhist friends, the Chinese,

2633
01:55:20,139 --> 01:55:23,631
就是心胸放宽  说真心话
Is to keep an open heart and to speak the truth.

2634
01:55:23,742 --> 01:55:27,644
所以  乔治  我想对你说  谢谢
So, what I want to say to you, George, is thank you.

2635
01:55:28,647 --> 01:55:32,481
谢谢你曾是我妻子生命中至关重要的人
Thank you for playing such a big role in my wife's life.

2636
01:55:34,086 --> 01:55:36,054
很荣幸能认识你
It's been great getting to know you.

2637
01:55:36,155 --> 01:55:38,256
祝你一路走好
And I wish you a peaceful journey

2638
01:55:38,256 --> 01:55:41,058
不管是在此地还是天堂
From here on in and over to the other side.

2639
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:42,320
过来  老兄
Come here, mate.

2640
01:55:42,428 --> 01:55:44,896
好的  我们会平安的
Okay, we're gonna do this.

2641
01:55:46,265 --> 01:55:48,324
谢谢  谢谢你所做的一切
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

2642
01:55:48,434 --> 01:55:49,401
好了
All right.

2643
01:55:49,502 --> 01:55:50,628
谢谢你
Thank you.

2644
01:55:50,736 --> 01:55:52,966
感谢你的盛情招待
All right, I appreciate your having us.

2645
01:55:53,072 --> 01:55:56,303
别担心  爸爸  他的病好了
Don't worry, daddy. He's not sick anymore.

2646
01:55:56,408 --> 01:55:57,636
埃拉告诉我们了
Ira told us.

2647
01:55:57,743 --> 01:55:58,903
我可没说
I didn't say that.

2648
01:55:59,011 --> 01:55:59,978
-你说过  -你说过
- Yes, you did. - Yeah, you did.

2649
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:02,013
-在我们画画的时候  -不是
- When we were coloring. - No.

2650
01:56:02,114 --> 01:56:03,138
-是  -就是
- Yeah. - Yeah.

2651
01:56:03,249 --> 01:56:04,273
孩子  那不是真的
That's not true, girls.

2652
01:56:04,383 --> 01:56:05,714
我没那么说
I did not say that.

2653
01:56:05,818 --> 01:56:07,115
我不知道她们在说什么
I don't know what they're talking about.

2654
01:56:07,219 --> 01:56:08,447
骗子
Liar.

2655
01:56:08,554 --> 01:56:10,419
骗子  骗子  火烧裤子
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

2656
01:56:10,523 --> 01:56:12,787
她们很害怕  很担心乔治
They were freaking out. They were worried about George.

2657
01:56:12,892 --> 01:56:14,985
我只是在安慰她们  只是...
I just said it so they wouldn't be scared. It was just...

2658
01:56:15,094 --> 01:56:16,493
孩子们  到里面去
Kids, go inside.

2659
01:56:16,595 --> 01:56:18,529
-能看《芭乐特》吗  -可以
- Can we watch Borat? - Yeah, you can.

2660
01:56:18,631 --> 01:56:20,030
我不想看芭乐特
I don't wanna watch Borat.

2661
01:56:20,132 --> 01:56:21,565
一会见
See you guys.

2662
01:56:22,835 --> 01:56:25,861
怎么回事  那是真的吗
What is going on around here? Is that true?

2663
01:56:25,971 --> 01:56:28,201
我从没说过他恢复了
I never said that he was feeling better.

2664
01:56:28,307 --> 01:56:30,798
他只是吃了一些药  然后貌似管用了
He just took some medicine and it's looking good for him

2665
01:56:30,910 --> 01:56:32,309
因为血液异常消失了
Because they can't detect it in his blood,

2666
01:56:32,411 --> 01:56:34,879
但这不代表他恢复了
But that doesn't mean that he's better.

2667
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:36,447
这种事很棘手
These things are very tricky

2668
01:56:36,549 --> 01:56:38,205
他不想告诉别人  
And he didn't want to tell anybody 

2669
01:56:38,206 --> 01:56:39,677
因为他不想触霉头
Because he didn't want to jinx it!

2670
01:56:39,785 --> 01:56:41,150
真的是你不想触霉头吗
Is that true that you didn't want to jinx it?

2671
01:56:41,253 --> 01:56:44,290
对  我很迷信的
Yeah. No, no, no, I... Yeah, I'm very superstitious.

2672
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:46,014
你这个大骗子
You're a terrible liar.

2673
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:51,028
不  什么都没发生
No, nothing's going on around here!

2674
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:53,564
绝对清白
It's completely innocent.

2675
01:56:53,666 --> 01:56:55,099
-我把戒指  -这是什么口音
- I left me ring... - What accent is that?

2676
01:56:55,201 --> 01:56:57,135
-就放在桌旁  -牙买加吗
- ...on the side table. - Jamaican?

2677
01:56:57,469 --> 01:56:59,562
别蒙混过关了  我不吃这套
Don't mock me. I don't appreciate it.

2678
01:57:00,072 --> 01:57:02,233
很多人去按摩馆
Lots of people go to massage parlors.

2679
01:57:02,341 --> 01:57:04,969
这不能说明我也去了
That doesn't mean I was getting a rub-and-tug.

2680
01:57:05,077 --> 01:57:10,481
夹克上那几根阴毛一定是服务员掉的
Those hairs on me jacket must've fallen off the waiter's pussy.

2681
01:57:10,983 --> 01:57:12,575
你发什么神经
What the hell has gotten into you?

2682
01:57:12,685 --> 01:57:14,915
在玩真心话和大冒险
I was at a footie game!

2683
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:16,612
你还要耍我吗
Are you taking the piss out of me?

2684
01:57:16,722 --> 01:57:21,455
我绝不会骗你的  亲爱的
I would never lie to you, mate. Oi?

2685
01:57:22,461 --> 01:57:23,428
我可没和你说笑
I'm not playing this game with you.

2686
01:57:23,529 --> 01:57:25,997
太蠢了  白痴游戏
This is stupid. What a stupid game!

2687
01:57:26,865 --> 01:57:29,961
克拉克  那我们就说实话吧
Clarke, let's tell each other the truth.

2688
01:57:30,569 --> 01:57:31,536
来跟我说明白
Just come clean with me.

2689
01:57:31,637 --> 01:57:32,797
没什么可说的
There's nothing to tell.

2690
01:57:32,905 --> 01:57:33,894
没有可说的吗
There's nothing to tell?

2691
01:57:34,006 --> 01:57:34,973
没有可说的
There's nothing to tell.

2692
01:57:35,074 --> 01:57:38,771
你不会说实话是吧  你去嫖娼了
You will never tell me the truth. That is a pussy move!

2693
01:57:38,877 --> 01:57:40,367
我跟你说  我没做过
You know what? I'm not doing this.

2694
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:43,676
我绝不会承认那些我没做过的事
I'm not being put on a cross for something I didn't even do!

2695
01:57:43,782 --> 01:57:44,942
跟他鬼混去吧
Enjoy each other!

2696
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:46,347
操你的妓女去吧
Go fuck your whores!

2697
01:57:47,052 --> 01:57:49,520
"干你的妓女去"
"Go fuck your whores"?

2698
01:57:57,363 --> 01:58:01,613
很好  他走了  真是让我解脱了
So, it's good that he left, and this is a huge relief for me.

2699
01:58:01,533 --> 01:58:03,558
抱歉  很抱歉
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2700
01:58:03,669 --> 01:58:08,231
我不需要这样的婚姻  我现在很好
I don't need to be in a marriage that is like that, so I'm fine.

2701
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:11,639
我没担心那个  我只想确定你没事
I'm not worried about that. I just want you to be okay.

2702
01:58:11,744 --> 01:58:12,870
该害怕的应该是你吧
I would be scared if I was you right now.

2703
01:58:12,978 --> 01:58:13,967
你开玩笑吗
Are you kidding me?

2704
01:58:14,079 --> 01:58:15,205
这是注定的
This is what needed to happen.

2705
01:58:15,314 --> 01:58:16,747
我会离开这里
I would run away.

2706
01:58:16,849 --> 01:58:17,816
不  有我在这里
No, I'm staying here.

2707
01:58:17,916 --> 01:58:18,883
你会离开吗
Are you gonna run away?

2708
01:58:18,984 --> 01:58:21,680
离开这里要我去哪  除非我们私奔
Where am I running to? Only if you come with me.

2709
01:58:21,787 --> 01:58:24,278
我现在真的很需要你在身边
I really need you around right now.

2710
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:25,379
好  好
Yeah. Yeah.

2711
01:58:25,491 --> 01:58:26,549
星期一之前不要走好吗
Can you stay till Monday?

2712
01:58:26,659 --> 01:58:27,956
当然可以
Absolutely.

2713
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:30,460
难道就不能先离开  过段时间再来
Can't we just go and, like, come back later, you know?

2714
01:58:30,562 --> 01:58:32,553
两情若是久长时  又岂在朝朝暮暮
I mean, if this is meant to be, it'll be.

2715
01:58:32,665 --> 01:58:34,257
我们不用一直待在这里
We don't have to be here right this second.

2716
01:58:34,366 --> 01:58:35,333
我们走吧
Can't we just go?

2717
01:58:35,434 --> 01:58:37,026
老兄  我不走  我明白
Man, I don't... I see...

2718
01:58:37,136 --> 01:58:37,904
老天
Jesus Christ

2719
01:58:37,905 --> 01:58:40,401
本能也告诉我现在应该走
Every instinct in my body is telling me to leave here, too.

2720
01:58:40,773 --> 01:58:41,318
很好
Good.

2721
01:58:41,318 --> 01:58:43,239
但就是这种怯弱让我过成现在这样
But that's what led me to this shitty life.

2722
01:58:43,342 --> 01:58:47,676
我要留下来  做该做的事  我爱她
I gotta stay here. I gotta do the right thing. I love her.

2723
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:52,308
老兄  马上她丈夫会回来杀了我们
Right now, her husband is gonna come back and murder us, man!

2724
01:58:52,418 --> 01:58:54,318
你看到他的胳膊了吗  跟腿一样粗
Did you see his arms? They look like legs!

2725
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:55,910
闭嘴吧  别傻了
Shut up. Don't be an idiot.

2726
01:58:56,021 --> 01:58:57,927
我不是...  
I'm not being an...

2727
01:58:57,928 --> 01:59:00,549
想想如果你是个澳洲壮汉
Imagine that you are a gigantic Australian man

2728
01:59:00,693 --> 01:59:03,457
有人到你家干了你的老婆
And someone came into your home and fucked your wife.

2729
01:59:03,562 --> 01:59:05,211
你会恨不得杀了他
You would murder him

2730
01:59:05,212 --> 01:59:06,531
扒了他的皮做顶帽子
And then you would make a hat out of his skin

2731
01:59:06,699 --> 01:59:08,530
澳洲人就是这么凶狠  我们走吧
'Cause that's what Australians do. Let's go!

2732
01:59:08,767 --> 01:59:11,531
埃拉  这都是胡话  谁都会离婚
Ira, this is deep shit. People get divorced.

2733
01:59:11,637 --> 01:59:15,164
人们犯了错  生活再不如从前
They make mistakes, they change their lives.

2734
01:59:16,408 --> 01:59:19,866
没什么好惊讶的  因为她嫁了个混蛋
It's not that big of a deal. She's married to an asshole.

2735
01:59:19,978 --> 01:59:21,946
她像是个发疯的女演员  老兄
She seems like a crazy actress, man.

2736
01:59:22,047 --> 01:59:23,446
我不知道和你说什么  老兄
I don't know what to tell you, man.

2737
01:59:23,549 --> 01:59:25,176
难道我就没资格追求幸福吗
Am I not allowed to be happy or something?

2738
01:59:25,284 --> 01:59:28,583
我一直孤孤单单的独居着  一成不变
I've been living alone and alone and alone. That's my life.

2739
01:59:28,687 --> 01:59:30,120
而这是我唯一爱过的女人
This is the only girl I've ever loved

2740
01:59:30,222 --> 01:59:31,814
我该对此袖手旁观吗
And I'm not supposed to do anything about this?

2741
01:59:32,658 --> 01:59:33,989
我什么时候才能幸福
When am I supposed to be happy?

2742
01:59:34,093 --> 01:59:36,857
为什么别人都是幸幸福福的
Why does everyone else get to be happy?

2743
01:59:36,962 --> 01:59:39,863
乔治  我以朋友的立场告诉你
Look, George, I'm just gonna tell you this, as a friend.

2744
01:59:40,632 --> 01:59:43,328
在我看来  你的快乐
From where I'm sitting it seems like your happiness

2745
01:59:43,435 --> 01:59:46,302
是建立在一个家庭的崩溃上面的
Might be coming at the cost of destroying this family.

2746
01:59:47,272 --> 01:59:49,763
好  那我也以朋友的立场回答你
Okay, let me respond to that, as your friend,

2747
01:59:49,875 --> 01:59:52,207
要知道你可不是我朋友
And let you know you're not my friend.

2748
01:59:52,311 --> 01:59:54,245
你就是个给我干活的
You fucking work for me!

2749
01:59:54,346 --> 01:59:56,707
我没问你的意见  
I didn't ask for your advice! 

2750
01:59:56,708 --> 01:59:58,806
你越界了  老兄
You're overstepping your boundaries, man!

2751
01:59:58,917 --> 02:00:01,078
现在给我拿罐健怡可乐去
Now go get me a fucking Diet Coke!

2752
02:00:01,186 --> 02:00:03,780
好好记住这才是你应该做的
And remind yourself that's what you do for me!

2753
02:00:03,889 --> 02:00:05,151
从凳子上滚开
Now get the fuck out of here!

2754
02:00:05,257 --> 02:00:06,224
好
Fine.

2755
02:00:07,226 --> 02:00:09,145
别现在滚  回来坐下
Don't fucking leave! Sit down here! 

2756
02:00:09,145 --> 02:00:10,127
我不想自己在这
I don't want to be alone.

2757
02:00:10,229 --> 02:00:11,958
好  好
Okay, fine.

2758
02:00:14,566 --> 02:00:15,533
我是马克
This is Mark.

2759
02:00:15,634 --> 02:00:17,192
嘿  马克  我是埃拉  近来如何
Hey, Mark, it's Ira. How's it going, man?

2760
02:00:17,636 --> 02:00:20,537
不太好  我没能参加托比・马奎尔的电影
Not too good. I didn't get the part in the Tobey Maguire movie.

2761
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:22,937
无关紧要  我有麻烦了  帮我一下吧
That doesn't matter. I have a problem. I need help, okay?

2762
02:00:23,041 --> 02:00:24,167
你去哪了
Where have you been?

2763
02:00:24,276 --> 02:00:27,006
我在马林郡  北加州
I'm in Marin county. Northern California.

2764
02:00:27,112 --> 02:00:29,808
听着  我要告诉你点事
Listen, I... I have to tell you something.

2765
02:00:30,082 --> 02:00:31,743
你坐着吗
Are you sitting down?

2766
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:32,817
-是的  -好的
- Yeah. - Okay.

2767
02:00:33,852 --> 02:00:35,217
有一晚我出去
The other night I went out to drinks

2768
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:36,309
跟制片人喝酒
With the producers of my show

2769
02:00:36,422 --> 02:00:38,151
里奥遇见了我们
And Leo met up with us.

2770
02:00:38,257 --> 02:00:39,511
他们很看好他  
And they were enamored by him 

2771
02:00:39,512 --> 02:00:40,452
认为他很幽默
And they thought he was really funny.

2772
02:00:40,559 --> 02:00:43,392
于是他们让他参演yo teach  他接受了
And they offered him a part on yo teach...! And he took it.

2773
02:00:43,495 --> 02:00:45,929
我看过那集  就知道是这样了
I saw the episode. I know that that happened.

2774
02:00:46,031 --> 02:00:47,191
-你看过  -看过
- You watched it? - I watched it.

2775
02:00:47,299 --> 02:00:48,266
喜不喜欢
Did you love it?

2776
02:00:49,001 --> 02:00:50,866
-是呀  -他很棒  对吧
- Yeah. - He was great, right?

2777
02:00:50,969 --> 02:00:52,869
这没关系  我和里奥没疙瘩  好吗
It was fine! I have no problem with Leo, okay?

2778
02:00:52,971 --> 02:00:54,063
跟里奥说  要是他遇到困难
Tell leo, if he's got a problem,

2779
02:00:54,173 --> 02:00:56,471
别像个小孩  要自己去克服
To stop being a baby and to just get over it!

2780
02:00:56,575 --> 02:00:57,599
里奥正在监听你们的通话
Why don't you tell Leo yourself?

2781
02:00:57,709 --> 02:00:59,734
你干吗不自己告诉他
'Cause Leo's been surveilling this whole conversation.

2782
02:01:00,045 --> 02:01:01,103
-衰人  -该死的混蛋
- You dick. - Fucking asshole.

2783
02:01:01,213 --> 02:01:03,010
-里奥 把你的电话挂了  -滚你的  了里奥
- Leo, get off the phone! - Screw you, Leo. Screw you.

2784
02:01:03,115 --> 02:01:04,480
老兄  最近忙什么
Hey, man what have you been up to?

2785
02:01:04,583 --> 02:01:05,880
在给乔治・西蒙口交吗
Sucking George Simmons' balls?

2786
02:01:05,984 --> 02:01:08,248
太酷了  我来教你  好好享受
That's cool. I've been on yo teach...! Living it up.

2787
02:01:08,353 --> 02:01:09,843
不好意思  里奥 Yo Teach  恶心
I'm sorry, Leo. Yo teach...! sucks.

2788
02:01:09,955 --> 02:01:11,047
去减减肥吧  埃拉
Go lose some more weight, Ira!

2789
02:01:11,156 --> 02:01:12,180
你太他妈瘦了
You look fucking weird skinny!

2790
02:01:12,758 --> 02:01:14,089
里奥  冷静
Leo, Calm down!

2791
02:01:14,193 --> 02:01:15,136
知道吗  埃拉  
You know what, Ira? 

2792
02:01:15,137 --> 02:01:16,457
我真想把我的眼镜戴在你屁股上
I want to put my eyeglasses on your asshole

2793
02:01:16,562 --> 02:01:17,641
这样我干你的时候
So it looks like you're blowing me 

2794
02:01:17,642 --> 02:01:18,990
还能看起来像是你在吹箫
When I'm fucking you in the ass,

2795
02:01:18,990 --> 02:01:19,395
你个贱人
You jerk!

2796
02:01:19,498 --> 02:01:20,465
你说的这些我就当没听到
That doesn't even make sense!

2797
02:01:20,566 --> 02:01:22,864
你要把眼镜放在我屁股上吗  怎样
You're gonna put glasses on my ass? what?

2798
02:01:22,968 --> 02:01:26,870
埃拉  我会在节目里给你找个角色
Ira, we will find something for you to do on the show, okay?

2799
02:01:26,972 --> 02:01:28,439
老师可以多几个朋友
Teach can have more than one friend.

2800
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:29,768
我们能不能回头再谈这个
Can we talk about this later?

2801
02:01:29,875 --> 02:01:31,074
我真的有麻烦了  
I am in a serious problem. 

2802
02:01:31,075 --> 02:01:32,673
我需要你们的建议  拜托
I just need some advice, okay? please?

2803
02:01:32,778 --> 02:01:33,914
只要听我说
Just listen to me for two minutes 

2804
02:01:33,915 --> 02:01:35,961
然后告诉我该怎么做就行了
And tell me what I should do right now,

2805
02:01:35,961 --> 02:01:36,270
好吗
Okay?

2806
02:01:36,381 --> 02:01:37,473
你们听见了吗
Will you do that?

2807
02:01:37,583 --> 02:01:40,279
好吧  如果你是认真的  我很抱歉  我会听的
All right. If it's serious, I'm sorry. I will listen.

2808
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:43,720
好的  事情是这样的
Okay. Here's what's happening.

2809
02:01:43,822 --> 02:01:45,619
我见证了一起出轨行为
I'm witnessing a slow-moving train wreck,

2810
02:01:45,724 --> 02:01:47,749
可是如果阻止的话  我会丢掉工作
But if I do something, I will lose my job.

2811
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:48,827
真的吗
Are you serious?

2812
02:01:48,927 --> 02:01:50,326
我不知道该...
So, what I don't know, is...

2813
02:01:50,629 --> 02:01:52,722
小气鬼
Screw you.

2814
02:01:54,266 --> 02:01:54,763
高点  再高点
Higher! Higher!

2815
02:01:54,798 --> 02:01:55,260
高点  高点
Higher! Higher!

2816
02:01:55,367 --> 02:01:56,356
-我上不去了  -你能行
- I can't. i... I can't. - Yes, you can.

2817
02:01:56,468 --> 02:01:57,935
你得下来一点
You, you have to go down a little bit then

2818
02:01:58,036 --> 02:01:59,731
-从中间走  -小心  别让他掉到你身上
- Through the middle. - Be careful. Don't let him fall on you.

2819
02:01:59,838 --> 02:02:00,805
我该把手放哪
Where do I put my hand?

2820
02:02:01,607 --> 02:02:02,676
我和克拉克谈过了
I spoke to Clarke.

2821
02:02:02,676 --> 02:02:06,510
他今晚要坐飞机回中国
He's gonna be at the airport tonight heading back to china.

2822
02:02:06,645 --> 02:02:09,205
等他回来我就告诉他
I'm gonna go tell him that when he comes back

2823
02:02:09,448 --> 02:02:11,882
让他去找个别的地方住
He should find another place to live.

2824
02:02:11,984 --> 02:02:13,212
等等  等等  等等
Wait, wait, wait, wait. what...

2825
02:02:13,318 --> 02:02:16,082
你说真的  太好了
You... yeah? Good. Good. yeah.

2826
02:02:16,522 --> 02:02:17,511
你会告诉他吗
You're gonna tell him?

2827
02:02:17,623 --> 02:02:18,988
我只是不想再让他回来了
I just don't want him coming back here.

2828
02:02:19,091 --> 02:02:20,353
-你不需要他了  -是啊
- You don't need him. - No.

2829
02:02:20,459 --> 02:02:22,518
有他在只会让你恶心
That'll just get you sick.

2830
02:02:22,628 --> 02:02:25,495
真好  你要告诉他  什么时候告诉他
Good, you gotta tell him. So, when are you doing that?

2831
02:02:25,597 --> 02:02:26,564
-今晚  -是的
- Tonight? - Yeah.

2832
02:02:26,698 --> 02:02:27,665
好了  好了  我要下来了
Okay, okay, I'm coming down.

2833
02:02:27,766 --> 02:02:28,733
跳
Jump!

2834
02:02:29,668 --> 02:02:30,692
我和朋友谈了谈
I talked to a girlfriend of mine,

2835
02:02:30,802 --> 02:02:32,861
她能找人给我们介绍
And she has somebody who could show us

2836
02:02:33,038 --> 02:02:35,131
几幢在洛杉矶的房子
Some houses down in los angeles.

2837
02:02:35,507 --> 02:02:36,701
我们可以过去看看
And we'll get that whole thing going.

2838
02:02:36,808 --> 02:02:41,245
我曾想过先让孩子们休学
Then I was thinking about taking the kids out of school now,

2839
02:02:41,346 --> 02:02:43,300
不过还是让她们上完吧  
But we should probably let them finish up 

2840
02:02:43,301 --> 02:02:44,440
都已经12月了
Because it's december.

2841
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:46,074
我不想把所有事都弄砸了
And I don't want to mess everything up.

2842
02:02:46,184 --> 02:02:47,981
他们得读完这一年
They have to finish the whole year here.

2843
02:02:48,086 --> 02:02:49,485
那对我很重要  所以我们
Yeah, that makes sense to me. So, if we just go down

2844
02:02:49,588 --> 02:02:50,885
明年夏初再走
At the beginning of the summer,

2845
02:02:50,989 --> 02:02:52,320
-让他们适应一下  -我本想
- Let them kind of transit. - I'm supposed to do

2846
02:02:52,424 --> 02:02:53,948
夏天的时候去度个小假
A little two-week tour this summer.

2847
02:02:54,059 --> 02:02:56,357
只是想去  不是非要去
I'm supposed to do it, but I don't need to do it.

2848
02:02:56,528 --> 02:02:59,964
别逼自己  瞧你  我又没给你施压
No pressure on you. Look at you! There's no pressure on you.

2849
02:03:00,065 --> 02:03:04,195
我需要工作  我想回归演艺事业
I need to work and I want to get my acting career going again.

2850
02:03:04,303 --> 02:03:06,032
-太棒了  -是啊
- Good. - Yeah.

2851
02:03:06,138 --> 02:03:08,698
她快追上你了茵格丽  干的不错路路
She's whupping you, Ingrid! Good job there, Lulu.

2852
02:03:09,975 --> 02:03:11,670
这么说  她今晚会去机场
So, she's gonna go to the airport tonight

2853
02:03:11,777 --> 02:03:14,678
告诉克拉克让他搬出去
And tell Clarke that she wants him to find a new place and...

2854
02:03:15,948 --> 02:03:17,939
你觉得怎么样
What do you think of that?

2855
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:20,211
我不想让你知道我是怎么想的
I don't want to tell you what I think about that

2856
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:21,843
因为我不想被你吼  乔治
'cause I don't want to get yelled at, George.

2857
02:03:21,954 --> 02:03:23,444
上帝啊
Oh, god.

2858
02:03:23,555 --> 02:03:25,019
我只是关心这俩孩子  
I'm just nervous about the kids and, 

2859
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:26,217
比如谁能获得抚养权
Like, who's gonna get them

2860
02:03:26,325 --> 02:03:28,486
是他和劳拉一人一个
And does he get one and Laura gets one,

2861
02:03:28,594 --> 02:03:30,186
还是我能把她俩都留下
Or am I gonna have both of them?

2862
02:03:30,295 --> 02:03:32,320
因为我喜欢小的那个  我们很合得来
'cause I love the little one, we kind of click.

2863
02:03:32,431 --> 02:03:36,197
而大的那个  就要到青春期了
But the older one is, like, you sense the period's coming soon.

2864
02:03:36,301 --> 02:03:37,962
我觉得她会把两个都留下的
I think she would probably get the kids.

2865
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:39,059
好吧
All right.

2866
02:03:39,171 --> 02:03:41,264
我觉得这两个小家伙都不会去中国的
I don't think you can have two girls in china.

2867
02:03:41,406 --> 02:03:42,873
-你们要干吗  -瞧她们淘气的
- What are you gonna do now? - Look at this crew.

2868
02:03:42,975 --> 02:03:44,237
怎么这么近
Why so close? really?

2869
02:03:47,179 --> 02:03:48,806
你没事吧  孩子  你还好吧
You okay, little girl? you okay?

2870
02:03:48,914 --> 02:03:50,313
-天啊  -你没事吧
- Oh, man. - Are you okay?

2871
02:03:50,449 --> 02:03:52,041
来看看梅波尔的歌剧
Okay. I'm gonna show you Mable singing...

2872
02:03:52,150 --> 02:03:53,139
妈妈  你给每个人都看
Mom, you make everybody see...

2873
02:03:53,251 --> 02:03:55,412
歌剧《猫》中的主打歌《记忆》  来吧
No, memory from Cats. Come on! it's...

2874
02:03:55,587 --> 02:03:57,214
不  我讨厌你总是让别人看
No. I hate that you show it to everyone.

2875
02:03:57,322 --> 02:03:58,812
我就让他们看看结尾部分
I'll just show them the end part.

2876
02:04:00,792 --> 02:04:03,158
来看看结尾部分
I'll just show you the ending. okay.

2877
02:04:17,442 --> 02:04:23,438
阴霾往昔  俱化尘烬
Burnt-out ends of smoky days

2878
02:04:24,316 --> 02:04:30,186
长夜退却  寒意逼近
The stale cold smell of morning

2879
02:04:31,623 --> 02:04:38,324
街灯燃尽  又一夜晚终结
The streetlamp dies, another night is over

2880
02:04:38,830 --> 02:04:43,995
新的一天即将黎明
Another day is dawning

2881
02:04:46,438 --> 02:04:48,998
轻抚我
Touch me

2882
02:04:49,174 --> 02:04:55,602
想起旧日独自徘徊的时光
It's so easy to leave me all alone with the memory

2883
02:04:56,314 --> 02:04:59,340
是如此轻而易举
Of my days in the sun

2884
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:04,815
轻轻抚摸我  就会知道幸福何情何景
If you touch me you'll understand what happiness is

2885
02:05:08,393 --> 02:05:14,354
看啊  新的一天已经开始
Look, a new day has begun

2886
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:23,207
难以置信
That was unbelievable!

2887
02:05:23,308 --> 02:05:24,969
唱的好吗
Isn't that good?

2888
02:05:26,611 --> 02:05:28,545
这太可笑了
That was insane!

2889
02:05:28,647 --> 02:05:30,581
看着一个小孩
That was like just seeing a little person 

2890
02:05:30,582 --> 02:05:32,515
唱老人唱的歌
Sing an old person's song.

2891
02:05:32,617 --> 02:05:34,448
真是歇斯底里
That was hysterical!

2892
02:05:34,586 --> 02:05:38,386
我有个很刻薄的朋友
I got a friend who takes... he takes a lot of acid.

2893
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:41,084
如果他看到了  他会笑得尿裤子的
If he saw that, he would shit himself!

2894
02:05:42,694 --> 02:05:43,922
这没什么可笑的
That's not supposed to be funny.

2895
02:05:44,029 --> 02:05:44,996
我知道  我知道
I know, I know, I know. I'm...

2896
02:05:45,097 --> 02:05:47,258
你们觉得不可笑那才滑稽呢
No, I think that's why it's funnier.

2897
02:05:47,365 --> 02:05:48,332
真是令人叹为观止
It was so amazing.

2898
02:05:48,433 --> 02:05:49,400
真的吗
Wasn't that good?

2899
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:51,162
我感动的都快哭了
I think I started crying a little bit.

2900
02:05:51,269 --> 02:05:54,238
我也是  每次我看都会哭的
Me, too. I cry every time I see that.

2901
02:05:56,341 --> 02:05:59,003
这真的挺可笑的
That shit was funny up there.

2902
02:05:59,111 --> 02:06:02,945
好吧  有些人就是想让我不得安生
Okay. wow, these guys are not gonna take no for an answer.

2903
02:06:03,782 --> 02:06:05,909
他们想让我再做一部婴儿电影
Yeah. They want me to do another baby movie.

2904
02:06:06,017 --> 02:06:08,645
又能卖DVD大赚一笔
They keep bumping up the gross on the Dvds.

2905
02:06:08,787 --> 02:06:11,415
我可不会再拍了
I just... there's no way I'm doing it.

2906
02:06:18,096 --> 02:06:19,393
好了  再见
Okay. Bye.

2907
02:06:24,569 --> 02:06:26,628
乔治
Hey, George.

2908
02:06:26,738 --> 02:06:28,069
怎么了
Yeah.

2909
02:06:28,173 --> 02:06:29,902
我去  我去商店
I'm going to... I'm gonna go to the store

2910
02:06:30,008 --> 02:06:31,168
买点烟  行吗
And grab some cigarettes, okay?

2911
02:06:31,309 --> 02:06:32,401
马上就回来
I'll be back soon.

2912
02:06:32,511 --> 02:06:34,775
什么  你买烟干什么
What? what do you need cigarettes for?

2913
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:36,370
因为我有烟瘾
'cause I'm addicted to them.

2914
02:06:36,481 --> 02:06:38,449
为什么  因为你觉得自己吸烟时很帅吗
Why? 'Cause you look like the Fonz when you smoke?

2915
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:39,180
我一直吸烟
I've always smoked.

2916
02:06:39,180 --> 02:06:41,246
我只是没当着你的面抽  因为你病了
I just didn't do it in front of you 'cause you were sick.

2917
02:06:41,353 --> 02:06:42,877
既然你已经好些了
And now that you're better...

2918
02:06:42,988 --> 02:06:44,099
快去快回  
Hurry up, though, man. 

2919
02:06:44,100 --> 02:06:45,582
我快跟她们玩得累趴了
I'm running out of gas with the kids here.

2920
02:06:45,690 --> 02:06:46,918
好的  我快去快回
Okay. I'll hurry up.

2921
02:06:47,726 --> 02:06:53,426
回忆  独自徘徊月光里
Memory, all alone in the moonlight

2922
02:06:55,367 --> 02:06:58,598
我无法等你到天明
I can't wait till the morning

2923
02:07:09,414 --> 02:07:11,780
我爸妈是不是要离婚了
Are my parents getting a divorce?

2924
02:07:14,786 --> 02:07:17,254
为什么这么问
Why... why... why do you ask that?

2925
02:07:17,889 --> 02:07:21,552
我看得出来  他们总是吵架
Just, like, I can tell. They're always fighting and...

2926
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:23,687
你觉得难受吗
How does that make you feel?

2927
02:07:23,795 --> 02:07:25,922
他已经不怎么回家了
Well, he's already away a lot,

2928
02:07:26,031 --> 02:07:30,229
虽然不是什么大问题  可是
So it doesn't really matter that much, but...

2929
02:07:32,337 --> 02:07:34,271
很影响心情
That wouldn't be fun.

2930
02:07:34,372 --> 02:07:37,102
也许他们分开会好点
Maybe it would be better if they were separated.

2931
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:39,607
不是吗
No?

2932
02:07:39,711 --> 02:07:41,144
也不大好
That's not good.

2933
02:07:41,246 --> 02:07:42,213
是啊
Right.

2934
02:08:04,069 --> 02:08:05,229

2936
02:08:11,309 --> 02:08:13,140

I don't trust you. Am I imagining things?

你没有臆想  亲爱的
You're not imagining anything, honey.

2946

两次  我只做过两次

2947

And I don't want to ruin everything just 

2948
02:08:45,831 --> 02:08:46,910

Look at our life. You're driving the kids to school.

2951
02:08:54,819 --> 02:08:56,753
接她们放学  你就像个单身母亲
You're picking them up. You're like a single mother.

2952
02:08:56,855 --> 02:08:59,653
你不是单身妈妈  你是我妻子  是我的宝贝
And you're not a single mom. You're my wife. You're my baby.

2953
02:08:59,758 --> 02:09:02,420
我不该去中国

2954

和那些连话都
Trying to sell oreos to people 

2955

The George Simmons thing was just a flirtation.

2962

你在这干吗
What are you doing?

2973
02:10:10,428 --> 02:10:13,727
该死  这个机场真是容易让人迷路

我还以为是熊猫快递

问她吧
Uh... ask her.

2979
02:10:28,179 --> 02:10:30,409

I was so mad at you for the way that you've been treating me

2980
02:10:30,515 --> 02:10:33,541
我来这是想告诉你

等你回来以后搬出去住

It's done. And it was no big deal.

他只是利用我来缓和病情
He manipulated me with his disease!

2990

02:12:16,488 --> 02:12:18,183
你以为这是游戏吗  省省吧
You think this is a game? stop it!

3023
02:12:18,289 --> 02:12:19,256
你想干什么
What'd you think you were gonna do?

3024
02:12:19,357 --> 02:12:21,188
搅乱摧毁我的家人吗
Come in and just fuck up my family?

3025
02:12:21,292 --> 02:12:23,021
-住手  -你是那么想的吗
- Stop it! - Is that what you thought?

3026
02:12:23,128 --> 02:12:24,117
住手  住手  不不不不
Stop it. stop. no, no, no, no!

3027
02:12:24,229 --> 02:12:26,060
-我什么也没干  -我要杀了你这个混蛋
- I didn't fucking do anything! - This sort of shit I kill for!

3028
02:12:26,164 --> 02:12:27,461
别杀他  别杀他
Don't kill him! Don't kill him!

3029
02:12:27,565 --> 02:12:29,055
你这个蠢货
You stupid shit!

3030
02:12:29,167 --> 02:12:30,134
不
No!

3031
02:12:30,235 --> 02:12:31,224
该死
Fuck, man!

3032
02:12:31,336 --> 02:12:32,963
-别跑  -快跑  乔治
- Come here! - Run, George!

3033
02:12:33,071 --> 02:12:35,198
别伤了他  你这个疯子
Don't hurt him, you maniac!

3034
02:12:36,374 --> 02:12:37,636
帮忙啊伙计
Cut the shit, guys!

3035
02:12:37,742 --> 02:12:38,709
住手
Stop it!

3036
02:12:40,078 --> 02:12:43,241
快跑  乔治  你跑到死角了  往那边跑
Run, George! You're cornering yourself! Go that way!

3037
02:12:43,348 --> 02:12:44,679
-离我远点  -像个男人  乔治
- Get away from me! - Take it like a man, George!

3038
02:12:44,782 --> 02:12:46,647
离我远点  你这个疯子
Get away from me, you fucking crazy asshole!

3039
02:12:46,751 --> 02:12:49,481
你这个混蛋  滚开
You fucking asshole! Get away!

3040
02:12:50,788 --> 02:12:52,278
上帝啊
Oh, My god.

3041
02:12:52,390 --> 02:12:54,381
她和你在一起不幸福
She's not happy with you!

3042
02:12:54,492 --> 02:12:57,256
没有哪个婚姻是一直幸福的  你这白痴
No one who's married is happy, you idiot!

3043
02:12:58,096 --> 02:13:00,428
缩成一团  乔治  缩成一团
Get in a ball, George! Get in a ball!

3044
02:13:00,532 --> 02:13:02,159
像个男人一样站起来  来打一架  行吗你
Fight like a man! Get on your feet, would you?

3045
02:13:02,267 --> 02:13:03,517
我是喜剧演员  
I don't know how to fight! 

3046
02:13:03,518 --> 02:13:05,236
我不会打架  你这混蛋
I'm a comedian, you fucking asshole!

3047
02:13:05,336 --> 02:13:06,303
要我帮忙吗
Should I jump in?

3048
02:13:06,404 --> 02:13:08,099
不  不  不要你管
No! no! don't jump in!

3049
02:13:08,206 --> 02:13:10,174
离我远点  你这个叛徒
Just get away from me, man! you traitor!

3050
02:13:10,275 --> 02:13:12,334
抽你的烟去  你这个骗子
Go get more cigarettes, you liar!

3051
02:13:12,443 --> 02:13:13,671
我什么都没做
I accomplished nothing!

3052
02:13:13,778 --> 02:13:15,678
我到之前他们就和好了
They made up before I got there!

3053
02:13:16,915 --> 02:13:18,883
你的头盔呢  美国佬
Where's your helmet now, yankee?

3054
02:13:18,983 --> 02:13:21,451
来谈谈吧  克拉克
Let's talk! clarke!

3055
02:13:21,553 --> 02:13:23,145
克拉克  不要
Clarke, no!

3056
02:13:23,254 --> 02:13:25,085
还手啊娘们
Come on, pussy!

3057
02:13:25,190 --> 02:13:26,157
救命
Help!

3058
02:13:27,225 --> 02:13:28,419
好吧
All right!

3059
02:13:28,526 --> 02:13:29,515
停止
Stop!

3060
02:13:29,627 --> 02:13:31,356
我抓到他了  我抓到了  你不想这样吧  史麦拉
I got him! I got him! you don't want this, schmira.

3061
02:13:31,462 --> 02:13:33,191
你想尝尝我的厉害吧  史麦拉
You don't want a piece of me, schmira!

3062
02:13:33,298 --> 02:13:34,959
我会爱死这个的
I am gonna love this!

3063
02:13:36,534 --> 02:13:37,899
上帝啊
God!

3064
02:13:38,002 --> 02:13:40,630
你这个贱人  我就知道你不想看到我幸福
You son of a bitch! I knew you didn't want me to be happy!

3065
02:13:40,738 --> 02:13:43,832
你在干吗  老兄  你真他妈恶心
What are you doing, man? look at this! you fucking suck!

3066
02:13:43,942 --> 02:13:45,375
你疯啦  真没用
You've gone crazy! you're a lightweight...

3067
02:13:45,476 --> 02:13:46,602
滚开
Get away from me, man!

3068
02:13:46,711 --> 02:13:49,179
埃拉・烤肠  埃拉・烤肠
...named ira wiener! ira wiener!

3069
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:51,214
-你还不如去死  -我现在死不了啦
- You should have died! - Well, I ain't going nowhere!

3070
02:13:51,316 --> 02:13:52,874
-我才不会死呢  -我想让你去死
- I'm never gonna die! - I hope you die!

3071
02:13:52,984 --> 02:13:54,713
-亲爱的  我才死不了  -去死
- I'm never gonna die, baby! - Die!

3072
02:13:54,819 --> 02:13:56,013
-你们别打了  -我希望你们挂掉  讨厌你们
- Boys, stop it! - I hope you die! I hate you!

3073
02:13:56,120 --> 02:13:57,553
我知道你俩要干吗
I know what you're trying to do, the pair of you!

3074
02:13:57,655 --> 02:13:59,623
你就想分散我注意力  让我忘记打他
You're trying to distract me so I won't hit him!

3075
02:13:59,724 --> 02:14:01,021
马屁精  马屁精
Lackey! Lackey!

3076
02:14:01,125 --> 02:14:02,114
等等
Wait!

3077
02:14:02,227 --> 02:14:04,195
妈的  克拉克
Oh, shit, clarke! dude!

3078
02:14:04,295 --> 02:14:05,523
你还好吗  乔治
Are you okay, George?

3079
02:14:05,630 --> 02:14:07,427
你的特技男在哪呢
Where's your stunt man now, hey?

3080
02:14:07,532 --> 02:14:08,499
够了
Stop it!

3081
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:11,034
你能不要再打了吗
Will you stop hitting me?

3082
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:14,730
我现在好多了  不过可能还会再生病
I'm better now, but it can come back!

3083
02:14:16,441 --> 02:14:18,875
劳拉  告诉他你对我说的话
Laura, tell him. tell him what you told me.

3084
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:22,846
告诉他你爱我多一些  告诉他
Tell him that you love me more than you love him. tell him!

3085
02:14:23,081 --> 02:14:24,207
她这么跟你说的时候
Yeah, when she told you that,

3086
02:14:24,315 --> 02:14:26,442
是以为你快死了
Did she think you were dying, huh?

3087
02:14:27,185 --> 02:14:29,710
告诉他 告诉他  选我还是他
Tell him. tell him. is it me or him?

3088
02:14:32,757 --> 02:14:34,088
他
Him.

3089
02:14:34,192 --> 02:14:38,526
什么  拜托  你说真的吗
What? come on! are you serious?

3090
02:14:39,497 --> 02:14:42,557
他是我丈夫  我们是一家人
He's my husband. we have a family.

3091
02:14:43,468 --> 02:14:44,935
我爱他
I love him.

3092
02:14:45,403 --> 02:14:48,668
梅波尔唱《猫》的时候你都没哭
And you didn't even cry when mable sang cats.

3093
02:14:49,274 --> 02:14:50,832
你到底怎么回事
What's the matter with you?

3094
02:14:51,542 --> 02:14:53,908
我不想说谎  我不知道
I didn't want to lie. I don't know.

3095
02:14:54,012 --> 02:14:56,344
我早在百老汇看过
I've seen it on broadway before.

3096
02:14:57,682 --> 02:14:59,650
没那演得好
It wasn't as good as it.

3097
02:15:01,286 --> 02:15:03,516
你们在草地上干吗呢
What are you guys doing on the lawn?

3098
02:15:03,621 --> 02:15:05,179
我饿了
I'm hungry!

3099
02:15:05,923 --> 02:15:08,983
没事  我们只是  随便晃晃
Nothing. we're just... we're just mucking around.

3100
02:15:09,093 --> 02:15:11,118
走吧  进去吧
Come on. go back inside.

3101
02:15:17,468 --> 02:15:21,529
对不起  乔治  我一直爱你
Sorry, george. I'll always love you.

3102
02:15:22,573 --> 02:15:24,768
但是我们能怎样呢
But what are we gonna do?

3103
02:15:24,876 --> 02:15:26,343
我爱你
I love you.

3104
02:15:27,245 --> 02:15:29,577
抱歉过来打扰你  我不该来的
I'm sorry I came up here. I shouldn't have come.

3105
02:15:30,748 --> 02:15:32,375
没有  我很高兴你来了
No, I'm glad you did.

3106
02:15:33,618 --> 02:15:35,313
70岁的时候还有可能吗
Maybe when we're 70?

3107
02:15:37,655 --> 02:15:39,782
希望你可以找到幸福
I hope you find a way to be happy.

3108
02:15:40,325 --> 02:15:43,260
操  他回来了  他回来了  快走
Shit. he's coming back. he's coming back. let's go.

3109
02:15:43,961 --> 02:15:45,326
克拉克
Clarke.

3110
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:46,685
你知道吗  
You know what? 

3111
02:15:46,686 --> 02:15:49,196
我刚他妈明白到底怎么回事
I've just worked out why all this shit has happened.

3112
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:51,495
在东方  这个叫做报应
In the east, they call this karma.

3113
02:15:51,602 --> 02:15:55,766
因为我胡来才他妈有这种烂下场
And I have brought all this shit upon us with my misbehavior.

3114
02:15:55,873 --> 02:15:57,966
所以才他妈会这样
That's why all this shit has happened.

3115
02:15:58,609 --> 02:16:00,270
这是一定要发生的
This had to happen.

3116
02:16:01,045 --> 02:16:03,309
不过好运气就快来了
But some good shit's gonna come from this.

3117
02:16:03,781 --> 02:16:06,249
我们大家都得吸取教训
We have to learn from this, you know, all of us.

3118
02:16:06,351 --> 02:16:08,285
这是个很好的教训
There's a good lesson here.

3119
02:16:09,721 --> 02:16:12,281
愤怒之下是伤痛
Underneath anger is hurt,

3120
02:16:13,358 --> 02:16:16,691
但伤痛之下才见爱
But underneath hurt is love.

3121
02:16:17,428 --> 02:16:18,827
你感觉到了吗
You feel it?

3122
02:16:22,033 --> 02:16:23,261
可以吗
Okay?

3123
02:16:23,368 --> 02:16:24,392
恩  谢谢
Yeah. thank you.

3124
02:16:24,502 --> 02:16:25,491
抱歉打了你
I'm sorry about this.

3125
02:16:25,603 --> 02:16:28,538
不用放在心上
Yeah, yeah. don't worry about it.

3126
02:16:44,555 --> 02:16:45,579
想让我来开车吗
Do you want me to drive?

3127
02:16:46,791 --> 02:16:49,919
不用  你不用给我开车  我自己开
No, you don't have to drive me. I'll drive myself.

3128
02:16:50,928 --> 02:16:53,592
事实上  你永远都不用再给我开车了
In fact, you're never gonna have to drive me again 

3129
02:16:53,593 --> 02:16:55,160
因为你被炒了 埃拉
Because you're fired, Ira.

3130
02:16:55,566 --> 02:16:57,796
你是我认识的唯一一个
You're the only person that I've ever heard of

3131
02:16:57,902 --> 02:16:59,995
死不悔改的人  乔治
That learned nothing from a near-death experience, George.

3132
02:17:00,104 --> 02:17:01,696
你又恢复老样子了  比以前更烂
You went backwards. you're worse.

3133
02:17:01,806 --> 02:17:04,001
你知道我是谁吗  一个好朋友
You know what I am? A good friend.

3134
02:17:04,108 --> 02:17:07,566
我永远都不会跑到机场去出卖朋友
I would never run to the airport and rat somebody out.

3135
02:17:07,678 --> 02:17:11,341
我没那种基因  那不是朋友该做的事
I don't have that in my DNA. that's not a friend, man.

3136
02:17:11,449 --> 02:17:13,781
朋友和你讲实话  朋友会走到你面前说
A friend tells you. a friend comes up to you and says,

3137
02:17:13,885 --> 02:17:16,012
"嘿  你有一堆麻烦  最好别乱来"
"hey, you're in a heap of shit. you better not do it. "

3138
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:19,112
而不会跑去和他妈的女人讲闲话
He doesn't run and tell the fucking girl.

3139
02:17:20,358 --> 02:17:22,417
行  炒了我吧  我再也不想跟着你了
Good. fire me. I don't want to be around you anymore,

3140
02:17:22,527 --> 02:17:24,654
因为你他妈会影响我
'cause you are fucking contagious!

3141
02:17:24,762 --> 02:17:26,992
你觉得我找不到助理了吗
You think I can't get another assistant?

3142
02:17:27,098 --> 02:17:29,658
我找不到其他人给我写段子了吗
I can't get someone else to write jokes for me?

3143
02:17:29,767 --> 02:17:31,536
你以为我会躺在床上想
You think I'm gonna lay in my bed going, 

3144
02:17:31,537 --> 02:17:33,601
"真想念我的史麦拉呀"
"aw, I miss my schmira"?

3145
02:17:34,172 --> 02:17:37,141
你他妈根本没思想  这是你唯一的优点
You're a fucking no-thought. That's the beauty.

3146
02:17:37,241 --> 02:17:39,937
你一走我就会马上忘记你了
Once you're gone it never comes back in my brain.

3147
02:17:40,044 --> 02:17:41,568
你以为得到劳拉就能开心了吗
You think getting laura would have made you happy?

3148
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:42,405
对的呀
I know so. 

3149
02:17:42,406 --> 02:17:44,876
你觉得你有个家你就会幸福吗
You think if you had a family right now, You would be happy?

3150
02:17:44,982 --> 02:17:46,486
你永远不开心  
You'll never be happy, 

3151
02:17:46,487 --> 02:17:48,179
因为你只在乎你自己
'Cause you're always gonna be stuck with yourself!

3152
02:17:48,286 --> 02:17:51,346
除非你能改正这点
Unless somehow you can get away from you,

3153
02:17:51,456 --> 02:17:53,890
不然你会永远都那么可悲的  乔治
You're always gonna be miserable, george.

3154
02:17:53,991 --> 02:17:56,016
你一点都不幽默
You are not funny.

3155
02:17:56,127 --> 02:17:58,220
如果那意味着我不像你
Well, if that means I'm less like you,

3156
02:17:58,329 --> 02:18:00,627
那太好了  我才不要那种幽默呢
Then good, I don't want to be funny, okay?

3157
02:18:01,199 --> 02:18:03,167
任务完成了  埃拉
Mission accomplished, Ira.

3158
02:18:04,669 --> 02:18:06,227
入错行了
Bad career choice.

3159
02:18:06,904 --> 02:18:09,998
喜剧是幽默的人的事
Comedy usually is for funny people.

3160
02:19:10,801 --> 02:19:13,292
你的衣橱和抽屉里可能塞满了东西
Chances are you've got a lot of stuff stuffed in your drawers and closets

3161
02:19:13,404 --> 02:19:14,393
都是你不需要的
That you don't really need.

3162

She's here to help you get trashing, 

3164
02:19:19,410 --> 02:19:20,376
打包和整理

3165
02:19:20,478 --> 02:19:22,070

-Hello, Mary. - Hi, Hoda.

3166
02:19:22,179 --> 02:19:25,307
我们会为些古怪的原因保存东西

3167
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:30,512
早上好

3168
02:19:32,590 --> 02:19:34,854
我觉得我今天会原谅他
I think I'm gonna forgive him today.

3169
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:36,290
什么  真的吗
What? really? yeah.

3170
02:19:36,394 --> 02:19:38,555
太好了  真是好消息
Great! that's great news!

3171
02:19:38,663 --> 02:19:40,443
怕他知道我上了Yo teach  会嫉妒
He's just gonna be so jealous that I'm on yo teach...! 

3172
02:19:40,444 --> 02:19:43,266
你知道那是件挺酷的事
you know? I just figured it'd be a cool thing to do.

3173
02:19:43,367 --> 02:19:46,302
可能我们也能给他找点事做
Well, maybe we could find something for him.

3174
02:19:46,804 --> 02:19:49,369
如果能顺其自然  那肯定
You know, if it comes up organically, definitely,

3175
02:19:49,369 --> 02:19:50,865
但是我们也不能强求
But we shouldn't force it.

3176
02:19:50,975 --> 02:19:52,169
你知道的 不是吗
You know? right.

3177
02:19:52,276 --> 02:19:54,267
我才不想上Yo teach呢
I don't want to be on yo teach...!

3178
02:19:55,479 --> 02:19:57,071
没关系  我原谅你
It's okay. I forgave you, you know?

3179
02:19:57,181 --> 02:19:58,273
谢谢
Thank you.

3180
02:19:59,450 --> 02:20:03,250
这个周末在那边过得怎样
So, how'd everything go up there this weekend?

3181
02:20:03,955 --> 02:20:05,824
我觉得自己做的是对的
I think I did the right thing,

3182
02:20:05,824 --> 02:20:08,983
但乔治炒了我还一拳打在我脸上
But george fired me and punched me in the face.

3183
02:20:10,962 --> 02:20:12,554
你有什么想说的吗
You want to talk about it?

3184
02:20:12,663 --> 02:20:13,630
没有
No.

3185
02:20:15,132 --> 02:20:17,258

3186

听起来挺震撼的
It sounds like the greatest story, ever.

3187
02:20:20,237 --> 02:20:22,569
2点时把我叫醒  我就跟你讲
Wake me up at 2:00. I'll tell you about it.

3188
02:20:23,641 --> 02:20:26,235
好吧  很高兴你回来了

很高兴你回家了
Glad you're home.

3190
02:20:27,745 --> 02:20:30,270
真不敢相信我得从头来过
I can't believe I have to start all over again.

3191
02:20:31,449 --> 02:20:34,043
嗨  兄弟  最近怎么样
Hey, man, how you doing?

3194

3201
02:21:04,315 --> 02:21:07,113
我和朋友远足到这里  我时常想
Me and my friends, we hike up here and I always thought,

3202
02:21:07,218 --> 02:21:08,344
"这里真是个约会的好地方"
"you know, that'd be a great place to take

3203

"如果你  有女人的话"

3204
02:21:12,156 --> 02:21:13,214
现在你有了
Well, now you know one.

3205

My friends are very sexually aggressive, which is hard for me.

3224
02:22:17,855 --> 02:22:19,652
看电视的时候看到
You know, we'll watch television and they'll just see...

3225
02:22:19,757 --> 02:22:21,657
辣妹出场的时候他们会说
A hot girl will come on and they'll just be,

3226
02:22:21,759 --> 02:22:25,217
"哥们  我真他妈想干那个妞"
"man, I wanna fuck the shit out of that girl, man!

3227
02:22:25,329 --> 02:22:27,024
"我得上了那个妞"
"I'm gonna fuck that girl!"

3228
02:22:27,131 --> 02:22:28,291
我就没种讲出那种话
And i, like, can't even say that.

3229
02:22:28,399 --> 02:22:29,889
我装都装不像
I can't even pretend I would do that.

3230
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,365
在电视上看到辣妹我就说
I see a hot girl on tv and I'm like,

Okay, thanks.

3240
02:23:09,173 --> 02:23:10,970
上次我来
The last time I came here,

3241
02:23:11,075 --> 02:23:14,670
烤牛肉上的线还没取下来
The roast beef you gave me had the string still around it

3242
02:23:14,779 --> 02:23:17,911
我没注意就给老伴吃了  
And I was unaware of this and fed it to my husband, 

3243
02:23:17,912 --> 02:23:19,478
结果给噎住了
And he choked.

3244
02:23:23,053 --> 02:23:24,645
最近怎样乔治
How's it going, george?

3245
02:23:26,023 --> 02:23:29,515
你有休息时间什么的我们能谈谈吗
You get a break or anything where you can talk?

3246

Shit.

3248
02:23:48,813 --> 02:23:51,304
你又回来工作啦
So, you had to get your job back here, huh?

3249
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:57,011
是啊  这工作还挺稳定的
Yeah. you know, I figured I could use a little job stability.

3250
02:23:57,555 --> 02:23:59,318
对不起
Oh, I'm sorry.

3251
02:23:59,590 --> 02:24:02,923
还能上健康保险  不错
I get health insurance. it's pretty good.

3252
02:24:03,594 --> 02:24:09,863
我回头想了想你在车上说的话
So, I thought a lot about what you said in the car to me.

3253
02:24:10,835 --> 02:24:14,532
有些问题你说得一针见血
A few of those things might have been accurate.

3254
02:24:15,439 --> 02:24:17,675
你只是想帮我  可是很对不起
You tried to help me and I'm sorry 

3255
02:24:17,676 --> 02:24:19,273
我却让你左右为难
I put you in the middle of all that stuff.

3256
02:24:19,910 --> 02:24:22,674
我的身体康复了
I'm better in my body.

3257
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:26,511
可我的脑子还不好使
My brain has a ways to go, though.

3258
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:31,313
那你最近怎样  还好吧
How are you doing, though? you're doing okay?

3259
02:24:35,192 --> 02:24:36,659
我也不知道  埃拉
I don't know, Ira.

3260
02:24:41,198 --> 02:24:42,165
我
I...

3261
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:46,167
那晚我听完了你的整场表演  埃拉  真不错
I caught your whole set the other night, Ira. nice.

3262
02:24:46,837 --> 02:24:48,498
你混出点样子了
Yeah, yeah, no, you're getting a rhythm.

3263
02:24:48,606 --> 02:24:52,702
你在台上也像是生活中我欣赏的埃拉了
You're starting to be the Ira I like in real life onstage.

3264
02:24:52,810 --> 02:24:55,506
谢谢  我最近进步了挺多
Thanks. I've been getting up a lot lately, so it's going well.

3265
02:24:55,613 --> 02:24:58,707
对对  挺幽默的  而且还是即兴演出
Yeah, you were funny, and it was a fart-free set.

3266
02:24:59,083 --> 02:25:02,985
我那晚后来写了一些段子
I wrote some stuff down that night that... some jokes.

3267
02:25:03,087 --> 02:25:04,850
你想听吗
You want to hear it?

3268
02:25:04,955 --> 02:25:06,650
你什么
You what?

3269
02:25:06,757 --> 02:25:09,409
我昨晚不停得给你编段子  
I couldn't stop thinking of jokes for you last night. 

3270
02:25:09,410 --> 02:25:10,022
真诡异
It was bizarre.

3271
02:25:10,728 --> 02:25:13,720
我没说这些段子一定好  但我尽力了
I'm not saying they're good jokes, but I try.

3272
02:25:15,733 --> 02:25:17,132
你还写下来啦
You actually wrote them down!

3273
02:25:17,234 --> 02:25:19,828
对啊  我他妈的记忆不好
Yeah, yeah, yeah. my fucking memory's horrible.

3274
02:25:20,537 --> 02:25:24,473
任天堂那个  你怎么说来着
That thing you did about the wii fit thing. what's that?

3275
02:25:24,608 --> 02:25:26,542
"我的游戏机"
Oh, like, "my video game... " yeah.

3276
02:25:26,644 --> 02:25:28,407
"我的游戏机说我肥"
"my video game told me I'm fat?"

3277
02:25:28,512 --> 02:25:30,309
对对  "终极背叛"
Yeah, yeah, yeah. "the ultimate betrayal. " yeah.

3278
02:25:30,414 --> 02:25:31,063
对  对
Right, right.

3279
02:25:31,063 --> 02:25:32,688
你也可以说  
You could maybe say, 

3280
02:25:32,689 --> 02:25:35,010
"我的啤酒肚笑我懒"
"I mean, that's like my pot telling me I'm lazy. "

3281
02:25:35,185 --> 02:25:36,345
这个真好笑
Oh, that's really funny.

3282
02:25:36,453 --> 02:25:38,421
"然后游戏机就像我奶奶一样"
"and the wii is similar to my grandmother.

3283
02:25:38,522 --> 02:25:40,319
