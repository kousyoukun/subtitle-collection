34
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:52,779
沒眼鏡你不是像瞎子？ 你的眼鏡呢？

-「這麼做…」，好啊 -我們一起吃午飯

紅球-衝動型犯罪 不是預謀，所以比較晚知道
A Red Ball. Crimes of passion have no premeditation, so they show up late.

82
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:25,979

It's gotta be Barnaby Woods. Evanna, flight time?

95
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,624
起飛後三分鐘可以了
The way I drive? Three minutes after wheels up.

96
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:42,602
-可以了 -可以了
Clear.  Clear.

97
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:05,444

Shit.

102
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:40,977

Which one is it?

103
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,307
-我不喜歡這張床！ -來嘛
Not the bed.  Come on.

104
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,787
我不喜歡在床上玩！
I don't want to be on the bed.

105
00:11:56,301 --> 00:12:00,381
-一分鐘，快追上未來了 -閉嘴，艾文納，傑德？
We're catching up to the future.  Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

106
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:03,217
-傑德？ -請講

00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:44,682
霍華！
Howard.

114
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,693
不戴眼鏡我簡直跟瞎子一樣

00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:24,854
命案不是被阻止了嗎？
I thought they stopped the murder.

132
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,376
這是「回音」，或稱「前視印象」
That's just an echo. PreCog deja vu, if you will.

133
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,873
預視者會不斷看見發生的兇案
The really bad ones the PreCogs see over and over again.

134
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:35,334
華利，把剩下的洗掉
Wally, erase the incoming.

135
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:53,117
想像一個沒有兇案的世界
Imagine a world without murder.

136
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:56,115
-我失去最好的朋友 -我失去姑姑
I lost my best friend.  I lost my aunt.

137
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:58,407
-我失去我父親 -我太太慘遭殺害
I lost my dad.  I lost my wife.

138
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:03,183
六年前，美國兇案發生率 達到歷史最高峰
Just six years ago, the homicide rate had reached epidemic proportions.

139
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:06,546
似乎只有奇跡才能終止這現象
It seemed that only a miracle could stop the bloodshed.

140
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:10,916
奇跡誕生了，而且有三個 犯罪預視先知
But instead of one miracle, we were given three: The PreCognitives.

141
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:13,977
犯罪預防條例實施一個月後
Within just one month under the Precrime program...

142
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,741
哥倫比亞區的兇案下降90%
...the murder rate in the District of Columbia was reduced 90%% .

143
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,137
-他們在等我 -他將會強暴我
They were waiting for me.  He was gonna rape me.

144
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:22,192
-我會被刺死 -這裡
I was going to be stabbed.  Right here.

145
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:26,794
一年之內，犯罪預防中心 阻止了首府所有兇案
Within a year, Precrime effectively stopped murder in our nation 's capital.

146
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,270
實驗計劃進行六年來
In the six years of our experiment...

147
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:30,400
犯罪防治局局長

148
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:32,975
一樁命案都未曾發生
...there hasn't been a single murder.

149
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:35,357
現在犯罪防治局將正式成立
And now Precrime can work for you.

150
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:38,458
我們希望能夠確定國人
We want to make certain that every American...

151
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:41,745
能信賴此系統的精確性
...can bank on the infallibility of the system.

152
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:47,365
在帶來安全的同時 還能確保國人的自由
And to ensure that what keeps us safe will also keep us free.

153
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,881
-犯罪防治局-有效 -功效卓著
Precrime. It works.  It works.

154
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:52,492
-功效卓著 -功效卓著
It works.  It works.

155
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,316
-功效卓著 -功效卓著
It works.  It works.

156
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:57,248
犯罪防治局-有效！
Precrime. It works.

157
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:02,356
4月22日星期二，請投票贊成 國家犯罪防治局的成立
On Tuesday, April 22, vote "yes" on the National Precrime Initiative.

158
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:08,846
怎麼回事？睡不著？
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

159
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,997
-我需要來點「冰品」 -內行人
Just need a little clarity.  True that.

160
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:22,258
傳統冰品還是改良的新配方？
You want the customary clarity or the new and improved kind of clarity?

161
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,278
新玩意兒
Give me the new stuff.

162
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:29,956
改良新配方，全新「冰品」 冰得你心曠神怡
New and improved clarity. Clarity, clarity. Yes, indeed.

163
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:32,034
快點，快點
Come on. Come on.

164
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,539
才四瓶，其中有的還沒效
Don't bust my balls. You've only given me four, and some of these are duds.

165
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:37,616
祝你好夢，隊長
Sweet dreams, chief.

166
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:43,082
別擔心，我守口如瓶
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

167
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,672
身邊有個大人物也不錯
I could use a little juice on my side.

168
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,139
你知道些什麼？
What do you think you know?

169
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,039
我爸以前常說
It's like my daddy used to say:

170
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:54,739
「在瞎子的世界裡
"In the land of the blind...

171
00:16:55,949 --> 00:17:00,149
獨眼龍足以當國王」
...the oneeyed man is king. "

172
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,795
我回來了
I'm home.

173
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:32,402
頂燈
Overhead.

174
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:30,213
電視牆
Wall screen.

175
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:39,211
-西恩！ -嗨，爸爸
Sean.  Hi, Daddy.

176
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,049
能不能教我跑快一點？
Can you teach me how to run faster?

177
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:47,150
班上同學跑得都比我快
Because all the kids in my class run faster than me.

178
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:48,854
這很好
That's good.

179
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:51,269
膝蓋抬高一點
Keep your knees up.

180
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:55,032
像那樣，高，再高
Like that. Like that. High. High. Like that.

181
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:58,859
-看到沒，你是天生飛毛腿 -我一定要常練習跑步！
See, you're a natural runner.  Gotta keep running.

182
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:01,962
不斷的跑吧
Yeah. Gotta keep running.

183
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,352
你要不斷的跑
Gotta keep running.

184
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:09,536
-將來會跟你跑的一樣快嗎？ -有一天你會比我快
Will I be as fast as you someday?  Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.

185
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:13,489
-將來會比誰都快 -我想你將來會比誰都快
You're gonna beat everybody.  I think you'll beat everyone someday.

186
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:16,962
-我要走了，拜拜 -等等
I gotta go. Bye.  No, no, no. Wait, wait.

187
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:19,943
-給我親一個 -不能親嘴唇
You gotta give me a kiss.  Not on the lips.

188
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:23,722
那是媽媽的專利
Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.

189
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,460
好吧，好吧
Yeah, all right. All right.

190
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:27,426
我愛你
I love you.

191
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:31,265
-我愛你，西恩 -我愛你，爸爸
I love you, Sean.  I love you, Daddy.

192
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:34,811
檔案結束

193
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,723
它讓我想起羅賽裡多海灘
Reminds me of Rosarito Beach.

194
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:11,726
記得嗎？
Remember?

195
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,140
我們只有20元
We had 20 dollars and...

196
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:19,985
睡在車裡等待日出 繼續度假
Waiting in that van so the sun would shine on our vacation.

197
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:26,418
約翰！約翰！ 不要拍
John. John. John, put the camera down.

198
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:31,713
我準備要睡覺了 你在幹嘛？拿走啦
Look, I'm all ready for bed. What is this? No. Put it away.

199
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:34,452
收起來
It's time to put the camera to sleep...

200
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,920
該照顧的是你老婆
...and time to come and take care of your wife.

201
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:45,917
不要拍啦，陪我看雨？
Why don 't you put the camera down and come and watch the rain with me?

202
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:50,248
不要？我會讓你永生難忘喔
No? I promise I'll make it a memorable moment.

203
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:57,808
攝影機放下，不然今晚別碰我
Put the camera down or you're not getting anything tonight.

204
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,935
檔案結束

205
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:42,818
司法部要把這系統拿走
A gentleman at Justice wants to take this away from us.

206
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:45,804
一星期後，民眾將投票決定
In a week, people will vote on whether or not...

207
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:49,286
我們這兒執行的是高尚的工作
...what we've been doing has been a nobleminded enterprise...

208
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:52,829
一個改變打擊犯罪方式的機會
...or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.

209
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:54,458
約翰
John...

210
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:59,296
注意這個丹尼威妥 司法部來的
...watch this Danny Witwer, the observer from Justice.

211
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:02,442
-我昨天見過他 -帶他參觀
I met him yesterday.  Let him look around.

212
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:04,928
回答他的問題 但，多留意點
Answer his questions, but watch him.

213
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,909
有問題的話，我們得先知道
If there's any problem, make sure we know about it.

214
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:12,378
被害人和兇手姓名刻在木球上
When the PreCogs declare a killer, their name is embedded in the wood.

215
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:17,177
因為每個球形狀和紋理都不同 所以不可能被偽造
Since the shape and grain of each piece is unique, they're impossible to forge.

216
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:21,135
據我所知 犯罪預防理論在法理上有瑕疵
You understand the legalistic drawback to Precrime methodology.

217
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:24,096
-又來了 -我也不贊成人權協會的看法
Here we go again.  I'm not with the ACLU on this...

218
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,936
但還沒犯法我們就先行逮捕
...but we arrest individuals who've broken no law.

219
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,772
-他們一定會犯罪 -預測完全依照物理法則
They will.  The commission is metaphysics.

220
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,688
先知預見未來，未曾有錯
The PreCogs see the future, and they're never wrong.

221
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,688
阻止了，未來就不會發生
But it's not the future if you stop it.

222
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:38,249
-這豈不自相矛盾？ -沒錯
Isn't that a fundamental paradox?  Yes.

223
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:42,357
你說的就是必然性 這現象隨處可見
You're talking about predetermination, which happens all the time.

224
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,840
-你為什麼要抓住它？ -它快掉下去了
Why'd you catch that?  It was gonna fall.

225
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,309
你確定？
You're certain?

226
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,889
但它還沒掉下去 就被你抓住了
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

227
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:56,774
雖被你阻止了，但一定會發生
Preventing it doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.

228
00:22:57,077 --> 00:22:59,397
曾經發生誤判嗎？
You ever get any false positives?

229
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:04,503
有人想殺妻，但沒動手 先知分辨得出來嗎？
Someone intends to kill, but doesn't. How do the PreCogs tell the difference?

230
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:08,596
先知看不見你的意圖 只看見你即將做的事
They don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.

231
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,763
為什麼看不到強暴案 襲擊或是自殺事件？
Why can't they see rapes, assaults, suicides?

232
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:14,011
謀殺的本質
Because of the nature of murder.

233
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,501
「傷害人類連繫最盛者」
Nothing's more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us...

234
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:21,687
-「莫過彼此間相互謀害」 -不會是惠特曼的詩句吧
...than the untimely murder of a human.  That wasn't Walt Whitman.

235
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,580
是艾莉絲海曼 預視系統與接口的設計者
Iris Hineman. She developed PreCogs, designed the system and the interface.

236
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:29,741
提到接口，可以打個招呼嗎？
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.

237
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:33,308
-跟海曼？ -跟他們
To Hineman?  To them.

238
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:38,394
-警察禁止進入聖殿 -你沒進去過？
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.  You've never been inside?

239
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:42,025
保持隔離，以免被控干預辦案
We keep strict separation so that no one can be accused of tampering.

240
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:46,413
-那我就是第一個進去的人 -你沒聽清楚嗎？
I'll be the first one to go in then?  Maybe you didn't hear me.

241
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:50,476
-如果是權限問題 -不
If it's a question of authority...  There is no question.

242
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,559
你根本毫無權限
You don't have any.

243
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,010
我的搜索令上寫的可不一樣
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.

244
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:10,612
-給我看 -沒問題
Show it to me.  Sure.

245
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:18,629
針對犯罪預防中心的調查一事
This investigation of Precrime and its personnel is conducted...

246
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:23,352
直接受首席檢察官的管轄和許可
...under the direct supervision and permission from the attorney general.

247
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,917
我在此是他的代表
I'm here as his representative...

248
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,090
也就是說 我現在是你的頂頭上司
...which means you're now operating under my supervision.

249
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:37,837
看起來你不瞭解狀況
Seems you've been left out of the loop.

250
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:50,486
準備好了，走吧
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

251
00:24:56,535 --> 00:25:00,455
-站住 -不得進入
Hold it right there. Hold on.  Not cleared for access.

252
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,401
眼珠辨識 約翰安德頓，允許進入
Eyedent: John Anderton. Approved.

253
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,683
-華利 -不可以
Wally.  No, no, no, no.

254
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:17,128
這位是司法部來的丹尼威妥 他有權徹底視察
Danny Witwer from Justice. We're to give him the run of the farm.

255
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,952
-我不能碰到你！ -別碰他或任何東西
I can't touch you.  Don't touch anything.

256
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:23,386
-你不能進來 -回答他的問題，我們馬上走
You can't be in here.  Just answer his questions.

257
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,169
-告訴我… -他們在睡覺
Tell me how...  They're sleeping.

258
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,282
對不起，介紹一下這裡的作業
Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

259
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,331
光子乳液的功能是養分與導體
The photon milk acts as both a nutrient supply and conductor.

260
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:37,736
它會強化他們收到的影像 那位女性叫亞嘉莎
It enhances the images they receive. We call the female Agatha.

261
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,878
雙胞胎是阿瑟和戴希爾 以光學斷層攝影術作掃瞄
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell. We scan by way of optical tomography.

262
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,011
白色光點指示頭盔內的脈動
Whitelight pinpoints pulse along the length of the headgear...

263
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,295
吸收腦波後再重新解讀
...and are reread after absorption through their brain tissue.

264
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,977
換句話說，我們見其所見
In other words, we see what they see.

265
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:57,912
他們不會感到痛苦 我們持續供給多巴胺和恩多啡
They don't feel pain. We keep their heads stocked with dopamine.

266
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:01,585
此外，撒托寧也在控制中
Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels.

267
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,783
不能沉睡
Don't want them to drift off into too deep a sleep.

268
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:09,545
-也不能太清醒 -最好不要把他們當人類
They can't be kept too awake either.  Don't think of them as human.

269
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,449
不，他們偉大多了
No. They're much more than that.

270
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,830
奇跡大多被科學粉碎了
Science has stolen most of our miracles.

271
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:24,627
某方面說，他們給我們希望 對於神性的希望
In a way, they give us hope, hope of the existence of the divine.

272
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:28,642
有人開始將先知當成神
It's interesting that some people have begun to deify the PreCogs.

273
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:31,125
先知只是辨識模式的過濾器
PreCogs are patternrecognition filters. That's all.

274
00:26:31,385 --> 00:26:34,345
-你們稱這裡為「聖殿」 -只是個外號
Yet you call this room the "temple. "  A nickname.

275
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:36,718
權力不在神諭本身
The oracle isn't where the power is, anyway.

276
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:41,454
而在祭司，他們甚至假造神諭
The power is with the priests, even if they had to invent the oracle.

277
00:26:43,147 --> 00:26:46,027
你們點頭，好像懂他的意思
You guys are nodding like you know what he's talking about.

278
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:50,607
隊長，我們改變命運的做法
Well, come on, chief. The way we work, changing destiny and all...

279
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,946
根本像神職人員而不是警察
...we're more like clergy than cops.

280
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,759
-傑德 -是的？
Jad.  Yeah?

281
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:58,441
去工作 全部去
Go to work. All of you.

282
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:08,751
對不起，老習慣
Sorry. Old habit.

283
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:12,527
當警察前，我念過三年神學院
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.

284
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:15,965
-我父親感到十分光榮 -他現在怎麼想？
My father was proud.  What does he think of your work?

285
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:20,785
不知道，我15歲時 他在都柏林的教堂被殺
I don't know. He was shot and killed when I was 15 at our church in Dublin.

286
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:23,945
我知道失去親人的感受
I know what it's like to lose someone close.

287
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:26,391
但失去兒子最為痛苦
Nothing's like the loss of a child.

288
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:30,731
我沒有孩子，只能靠想像
I don't have any children, so I can only imagine what that was like.

289
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:34,592
在公共場所失去兒子的感覺
To lose your son in such a public place like that...

290
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:37,989
至少這種事不會再發生了
Now we can make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone.

291
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:41,888
-廢話少說，你想找什麼？ -瑕疵
Tell me what it is you're looking for.  Flaws.

292
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,975
六年內沒有謀殺案，系統十分…
There hasn't been a murder in six years. This system is...

293
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:49,694
完美，我同意，瑕疵出在人
Perfect. I agree. If there's a flaw, it's human.

294
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:52,302
不變的真理
It always is.

295
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,100
約翰
John.

296
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:38,847
華利
Wally.

297
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:48,614
你看到了嗎？
Can you see?

298
00:29:20,812 --> 00:29:24,292
發生什麼事？ 她的腎上腺素破表了
What happened? Her ACTH levels just shot through the roof!

299
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:26,487
-你對她做了什麼？ -她抓住我
What'd you do?  She grabbed me.

300
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:30,415
不可能，先知只看得見未來 感覺不到我們的存在
Impossible. They're not aware of us. In the milk, all they see is the future.

301
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:34,619
-她盯著我看 -作惡夢吧？他們會夢見舊兇案
She looked straight at me.  It could have been a nightmare.

302
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:38,071
-她跟我說話 -跟你說？
She spoke to me.  To you?

303
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:40,132
她說什麼？
What'd she say?

304
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:42,773
「你看到了嗎？」
"Can you see?"

305
00:29:45,924 --> 00:29:48,222
（看守所）

306
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:04,209
你是所長？
You the sentry?

307
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:07,664
是的，長官，我叫吉狄恩
Yes, sir, I'm Gideon.

308
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:09,944
你是安德頓隊長
You're Chief Anderton.

309
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:13,341
音樂能使犯人放鬆
The music relaxes the prisoners.

310
00:30:13,617 --> 00:30:16,977
防罪中心警察不曾來過 有問題嗎？
I don't ever see you Precops down here. Am I in trouble?

311
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:20,373
還不確定，來查一樁兇案
Not yet. I'm interested in a murder.

312
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:24,107
-多得很，哪種手法？ -溺斃
I got plenty of those. Kill type?  Drowning.

313
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,220
這種倒不多
That narrows it down. Not too many in here for that.

314
00:30:27,507 --> 00:30:30,827
-白種女性受害人 -這跟司法部有關嗎？
Victim's Caucasian, female.  This about the Justice Department?

315
00:30:31,135 --> 00:30:35,415
我明天出差，這領帶怎麼樣？
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour they got tomorrow. You like this tie?

316
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:36,766
停
Stop.

317
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,840
倒回去
Roll back.

318
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:44,639
這裡！
There.

319
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:50,459
早期著名的案子 也許在你到任以前
She's a golden oldie. One of our first. Probably before your time.

320
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:54,993
-這是三位先知的共同檔案？ -對
This is the composite of the three?  That's right.

321
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:58,247
三份影像綜合起來播放
Combined data stream based on all three previsions.

322
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:01,779
-給我看亞嘉莎的 -這個嘛
Just show me Agatha's data stream.  For that...

323
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:05,681
我們得去找一找
...we go for a ride.

324
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,286
我的天
My God.

325
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,735
我忘了關了這麼多人
I'd forgotten there were so many.

326
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:36,711
要不是你，他們還四處殺人
And to think they'd all be out there killing people if it wasn't for you.

327
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:40,171
你看看，看起來多祥和
Look at them. Look at how peaceful they seem.

328
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:44,218
但心裡頭可忙得很
But on the inside: Busy, busy, busy.

329
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:48,905
對了，這裡有個大壞蛋
Okeypokey. Now that is one bad man.

330
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:52,661
他在羅蘭湖殺了安莉芙麗
He drowned a woman named Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

331
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:56,651
兇手身份一直是個謎
The killer's a John Doe, never identified.

332
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,240
為什麼還查不出來？ 眼珠掃瞄也無法辨認？
Why is he still a John Doe? Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan?

333
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:21,139
他跟別人換眼珠，欺騙掃瞄器
Those are not his eyes. He had them swapped out to fool the scanners.

334
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:25,341
花幾千塊，到處可以做
You can get it done on the street for a few thousand bucks these days.

335
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:29,352
你只要女先知的影像
Okay, so you want just the female prevision.

336
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:31,237
對
That's right.

337
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:40,553
好像沒有她的資料
We don't seem to have her data.

338
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:43,078
再找一次
Try again.

339
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:48,047
奇怪，看
This is odd. See?

340
00:32:48,362 --> 00:32:53,042
其它兩份都在 阿瑟和戴希的影像都在
We have the two previsions. We got what Art saw. We got what Dash saw.

341
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,330
但亞嘉莎的卻不見了
But Agatha's isn't here.

342
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,270
可能系統出了小問題
Probably just a glitch.

343
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,660
跟我談談安莉芙麗
Tell me about the intended victim, this Anne Lively.

344
00:33:05,213 --> 00:33:09,053
她跟這位無名氏一樣 有「紐洛因」毒癮
Looks like she's a neuroin addict, like our John Doe here.

345
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:12,225
但她住過畢頓勒戒所
Address history includes the Beaton Clinic.

346
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:15,592
所以她戒了，她現在住哪？
So she cleaned up. Where is she now?

347
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:16,965
失蹤

348
00:33:17,393 --> 00:33:20,113
又出問題，有一就有二
I guess glitches come in twos.

349
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:26,445
正所謂厄運接踵而至
You finally crawl your way out of one hole just to fall into another.

350
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:32,825
不行
No.

351
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:37,164
我不能讓你帶走，隊長
Can't let you take that out of here, chief.

352
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:41,721
-違反規定 -我看這裡違反規定的事不少
It's against the rules.  Anything else against the rules?

353
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:53,341
小心，挖出陳年往事 只會越弄越髒
Careful, chief. You dig up the past, all you get is dirty.

354
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,709
第三份影像呢？模糊不清？
The third prevision was what, kind of fuzzy or something?

355
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:06,104
第三份，亞嘉莎的不在裡面
No, the third prevision, Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

356
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:11,406
還不只如此 我發現許多案子都有影像失蹤
That's not all. There are a dozen more cases with missing previsions.

357
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,903
怎麼到現在還沒有感冒特效藥
You'd think we'd have found the cure for the common cold.

358
00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:17,445
-你壓力太大 -這是什麼東西？
It's stress.  What's this?

359
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:19,627
加蜂蜜的青草茶
Herbal tea with honey.

360
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:23,277
青草茶和蜂蜜我都討厭
I hate herbal tea. Almost as much as I hate honey.

361
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:26,349
快喝，不然倒在你腿上
Just drink it, before I pour it in your lap.

362
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:29,392
-喝點什麼嗎，約翰？ -不用，謝謝
Can I get you anything, John?  No, thank you.

363
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:33,326
威妥明天也計劃參觀看守所
Witwer's scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow.

364
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,561
對，帶他去
Yeah, give him a tour.

365
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:39,418
-勞拉打電話給我 -什麼？
Lara called me.  What?

366
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:43,347
她擔心你，說實話，我也擔心
She's worried about you. Quite frankly, so am I.

367
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:45,514
我沒問題
I'm fine.

368
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:49,497
我知道你常到貧民區
I understand you've been spending a lot of time in the Sprawl.

369
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:53,871
-跑步經過罷了 -三更半夜？
I go running down there.  In the middle of the night.

370
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:57,621
萬一威妥要驗你的尿怎麼辦？
What if Danny Witwer insisted on a full chem run?

371
00:34:57,956 --> 00:34:59,556
沒問題
I'm fine.

372
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:05,406
約翰，防罪中心變國家機構後 他們會把它搶走
The minute Precrime goes national, they are going to take it away.

373
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:08,038
-我們不會坐視它發生 -不會？
We won't let them.  No?

374
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:12,462
一個老頭 和一個嗑藥條子怎麼阻止他們？
How is an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?

375
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,548
我老頭說過
My father once said to me...

376
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,850
「不是你選擇愛做的事 是事情選擇你」
..."You don't choose the things you believe in. They choose you. "

377
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:22,028
你在此有其原因
There's a reason you are here.

378
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:27,860
假如預知犯罪早半年成立
你和勞拉便不用承擔如此悲痛
Had Precrime been in place earlier, your loss would have been prevented.

379
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,760
記住，全國人的眼睛…
Remember, the eyes...

380
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,439
全國現在都盯著我們看
The eyes of the nation are on us right now.

381
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:38,993
我是說話沒人聽的老傢伙
I'm not the generation anyone listens to...

382
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:43,333
但民眾相信你 如果你說對犯罪預防有信心
...but people trust you when you speak of your belief in Precrime.

383
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:48,368
他們相信那是肺腑之言 不是政治辭令，我早就知道
They know that it's a belief born of pain, not politics. I understood that.

384
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:52,158
我也曾促成這件事
I may have even encouraged it to help with the cause.

385
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,730

Chief Anderton, what is this that I'm seeing?

443
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:48,178
我有點糊塗了…
I'm confused about...

444

-安德頓，等等！ -再見，克羅

安德頓，等等！

I like you, chief. You've always been nice to me.

按警鈴前，我給你兩分鐘
Give you two minutes before I hit the alarm.

449

Thanks.

451
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:09,925
-你麻煩大了 -你設計我
You're in a lot of trouble, John.  You set me up.

452
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:13,084
我會將你的妄想癥歸咎於毒品
I'll write the paranoia off to the whiff you've been doping on.

453
00:42:13,412 --> 00:42:14,612
慢慢來
Easy.

454
00:42:14,872 --> 00:42:17,032
-慢慢來 -我似乎找到瑕疵了
Easy.  Seems I've found a flaw.

455
00:42:19,627 --> 00:42:20,787
你想怎麼辦？
What are you gonna do?

456
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:23,845
擁有毒品判六個月，外加解職
Possession will cost you six months and your badge.

457
00:42:24,132 --> 00:42:26,532
看來我們當不成同事了
I guess we won't be working together after all.

458
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:30,323
槍放下，別搞成紅球狀況
Now put the gun down, John. I don't hear a Red Ball.

459
00:42:51,911 --> 00:42:53,911
拉瑪？拉瑪？
Lamar. Lamar.

460
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:58,863
-拉瑪？ -約翰，怎麼回事？
Lamar?  John, what is happening?

461
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:01,088
威妥！他設計我！
It's Witwer. He set me up!

462
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:02,617
等等
Stop, just wait.

463
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:05,679
-一定是威妥！ -被害人是誰？
Witwer! It's Witwer.  Who's the victim?

-某個人 -是誰？
Somebody.  Who?

465
00:43:07,844 --> 00:43:09,764
-裡歐克羅 -他是什麼人？
Somebody... Leo Crow.  Who is he?

466
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:12,695
我怎麼知道！連聽都沒聽過
I have no idea! I've never heard of him.

467
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:15,897
而36小時後我會殺死他
But I'm supposed to kill him in less than 36 hours.

468
00:43:16,186 --> 00:43:19,346
-威妥怎麼能讀取案件檔案？ -你可以偽造腦部輸出嗎？
How could Witwer have access?  Can you fake a cerebral output?

469
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,250
-誰想要？ -你能不能？
Why would anyone want to?  Can you?

470
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:23,765
-我很懷疑 -海曼知不知道？
I doubt it.  Would Hineman know?

471
00:43:24,028 --> 00:43:26,028
-你先過來 -什麼？
Now listen, come in.  What?

472
00:43:26,322 --> 00:43:28,642
真相大白前我保護你的安全
I'll protect you until we get to the bottom of this.

473
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,870
查查威妥是否又進去過聖殿
Talk to Wally. See if Witwer's gone inside the temple again.

問傑德，下班後 分析室有沒有眼珠掃瞄紀錄？
Ask Jad for any offhour eyedents into the analytical room.

475

功能鎖定 返回辦公室
Security lockdown enabled. Revised destination: Office.

477

478
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:51,592
有沒有辦法解除鎖定？
Is there any way to override the lockdown?

479
00:43:51,932 --> 00:43:53,772
-不，不 -不？
No, no, no.  No?

480
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:57,419
隨便在哪見面，先到我家
I'll meet you anywhere you say. You can come to my house, John.

481
00:43:57,771 --> 00:44:00,251
我會在那被抓，我不想戴頭銬
I can't. They'll get me. I'm not gonna get haloed.

482
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:01,646
你逃不掉的
You can't run.

483
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:03,851
每個人都會逃
Everybody runs.

484
00:44:50,952 --> 00:44:52,792
-天啊 -喂，喂
Oh, my God!  Hey, hey.

485
00:44:52,897 --> 00:44:54,489
哇

486
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:10,029
噢，你還好吧？
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

487
00:45:13,393 --> 00:45:15,513
我會把他毫髮無傷地逮捕歸案
I'll bring him in. Unharmed.

488
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:18,371
高登，不必了，小組由我接管
You're not gonna do that. I'm taking control.

489
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:19,848
什麼？
What?

490
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:24,348
佛萊契是第二指揮官 讓他表現一下，你從旁觀察
Fletcher is second in command. It's his show to run. You can observe.

他們今年投手群不強
John doesn't think they have a deep enough pitching roster.

495
00:45:39,795 --> 00:45:43,515
你為什麼護著他？ 你知道他在嗑藥
Why are you protecting him? You knew he was doping, yet you did nothing.

496
00:45:43,883 --> 00:45:47,083

The man lost a child, for chrissake.  Six years ago.

What did you talk about?  None of your business.

498

It's my business. Investigation of a supervising officer for a capital crime...

He's my suspect.  He's my subordinate.

501
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,799
問檢察總長，由他釐清權責
Call the attorney general. I'm sure he'd clarify the issue for you.

Get away, John Anderton. Forget your troubles.

He's been eyedented on the Metro. The train stops at 20th and 33rd.

516
00:47:28,819 --> 00:47:31,151
（犯罪預防中心獵捕自家人）

517
00:47:56,271 --> 00:47:57,631
啟動噴射背心！
Fire them up!

518
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,760
-嘿，佛萊契 -嘿，約翰
Hey, Fletch.  Hey, John.

519
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:26,088
-降落得不太漂亮 -是啊
That was a rough landing.  Yeah.

520
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:28,704
-你要多練習 -我的膝蓋不太好
Work on that.  It's the shit knee of mine.

521
00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:30,854
-哦 -不要逃
Yeah.  Don't do it.

522
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:33,443
嘿，不要逃
Hey, don't do this.

523
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:35,469
約翰？
John?

524
00:48:35,854 --> 00:48:37,134
不要逃
Don't run.

525
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,650
你沒必要追我
You don't have to chase me.

526
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,917
你沒必要逃
You don't have to run.

527
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,119
每個人都會逃，佛萊契
Everybody runs, Fletch.

528
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:46,325
我們會逮到你
You know we'll catch you.

529
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:49,048
每個人都會逃
Everybody runs.

530
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,039
-沒必要搞得很難看 -每個人都會逃
It doesn't have to be like this, John.  Everybody runs.

531
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:57,414
催吐棒準備好
Get your sicksticks ready.

532
00:48:58,878 --> 00:49:00,558
每個人都會逃，佛萊契
Everybody runs, Fletch.

533
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:03,653
慢慢來，隊長，別衝動
Slow down, chief. Just take it easy.

534
00:49:07,763 --> 00:49:09,603
別輕舉妄動，隊長
No sudden moves, chief.

535
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,810
約翰，沒事的
John, it's okay.

536
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:15,472
-佛萊契… -冷靜，別衝動
Fletch...  Easy does it, chief.

537
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:45,375
抓牢了嗎？
Got a grip?

538
00:49:45,594 --> 00:49:47,274
-抓牢了嗎？ -抓牢了
Got a grip?  Yeah.

539
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,485
安德頓！
Anderton!

540
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:51,301
滾出我的廚房！
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

541
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:54,541
滾出去！出去！
Get out of my house! Get out of my house! Go!

542
00:50:57,669 --> 00:51:00,069
-出去！ -安德頓，住手！
Get them out of here!  Anderton, stop!

543
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:02,939
拉他下來，佛萊契
Pull him off me, Fletcher. Get him off me.

544
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,840
滾出去！聽不懂嗎？
Get him out of here! What's the matter with you?!

545
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,180
滾出去！快！
Get out of my house! Go!

546
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:39,955
根據特區犯罪預防中心授權 你被逮捕…
By mandate of the District of Columbia, I'm placing you under arrest for...

547
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:41,619
睡一覺吧
Go to sleep.

548
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,050
跟我來
You two stay with me!

549
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,903
（非請勿入）

550
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:36,341
海曼博士？
Dr. Hineman.

551
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:40,105
你私闖民宅，我不接待訪客
You're trespassing. I don't have visitors.

552
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:48,414
你中了娃娃眼的毒，它的藤蔓
That would be from the doll's eye, the vine...

553
00:56:48,703 --> 00:56:51,903
在你攀牆進來時劃破你的皮
...the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall.

554
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:55,887
不是純娃娃眼 我培育的混種，蠻厲害的
It's not a true doll's eye. It's a little hybrid I designed.

555
00:56:56,253 --> 00:56:59,853
一旦毒液進入血管
Once the poison gets into your bloodstream, you'll start to see...

556
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:04,216
你會開始看到 藍色物體的神奇景象
...the most extraordinary display of blue objects.

557
00:57:04,553 --> 00:57:07,913
這星期倒霉透了吧？
This just isn't your week, is it?

558
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,999
安德頓隊長
Chief Anderton.

559
00:57:13,479 --> 00:57:14,999
我不是兇手
I'm not a killer.

560
00:57:21,112 --> 00:57:22,512
喝下去
You better drink this.

561
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:26,661
不然你會無法吞嚥 然後就完蛋了
Soon you won't be able to swallow, and then you'll be totally buggered.

562
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,278
全部喝掉
All of it.

563
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,360
休息一分鐘回回神
Okay, now take a minute to right yourself.

564
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:38,316
你認為我能幫什麼忙？
Just what is it you think I can do for you?

565
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:45,165
告訴我如何 偽造預視影像？
You could tell me how someone can fake a prevision.

566
00:57:45,555 --> 00:57:47,435
我怎麼知道？
How would I know that?

567
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:50,291
因為系統是你發明的
Because you invented Precrime.

568
00:57:52,437 --> 00:57:53,957
有什麼好笑的？
What's so funny?

569
00:57:54,522 --> 00:57:59,402
如果基因學上的一個錯誤 加上科學上的失控
If the consequences of several genetic mistakes and science gone haywire...

570
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:02,537
叫發明 那麼算我發明的
...can be called an invention, then I invented Precrime.

571
00:58:02,864 --> 00:58:04,784
-你不引以為榮？ -不
You don't seem proud.  I'm not.

572
00:58:05,075 --> 00:58:08,115
我想治療他們，不是加以變造
I was trying to heal them, not turn them into something else.

573
00:58:08,412 --> 00:58:11,092
-治療誰？ -現在被用來阻止犯罪的人
Heal who?  The innocents we use to stop the guilty.

574
00:58:11,415 --> 00:58:14,495
你是指先知
You're talking about the PreCogs.

575
00:58:14,836 --> 00:58:19,796
你以為他們是試管做出來的？ 他們是僥倖存活者
You think they came from a test tube? They are merely the ones who survived.

576
00:58:20,216 --> 00:58:23,856
我研究吸毒者後代的基因問題
I was doing genetic research, treating children of drug addicts.

577
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,700
十年前，紐洛因剛問世
This was 10 years ago, when neuroin first hit the streets.

578
00:58:28,058 --> 00:58:33,978
成分不純，粗製濫造的藥品 大受知識分子的歡迎
It was impure, not the engineered cocktail popular among the educated.

579
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:40,668
那些孩子天生腦部受創 大部分12歲以前就死了
All of these kids were born with severe brain damage. Most died before age 12.

580
00:58:41,113 --> 00:58:43,713
少數活下來的有種天賦
Those few who survived, they had a gift.

581
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:47,191
我稱之為天賦，對他們來說 像是上帝開了個大玩笑
I call it a gift. For them, it was more like a cosmic joke.

582
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:50,177
他們會半夜醒來尖叫
They would wake up in the night, curled in the corner...

583
00:58:50,497 --> 00:58:52,337
亂抓壁紙，因為…
...screaming, clawing at the walls.

584
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:56,785
他們晚上一閉上眼睛
Because when these children closed their eyes at night...

585
00:58:57,129 --> 00:59:01,409
會夢見兇殺案，一樁接一樁
...they dreamt only of murder over and over, one after the other.

586
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,200
我們不久就發現 這些所謂的夢
It didn't take for us long to realize that the real nightmare was...

587
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:10,315
都成了事實 那些兇殺案實際發生了
...that these dreams were about to come true, these murders were happening.

588
00:59:14,439 --> 00:59:16,759
你說其中一些孩子死了？
You say some of the children died?

589
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:20,147
很多，儘管我們盡力治療
So many of them. Despite what we did for them.

590
00:59:20,487 --> 00:59:24,567
或許正因為我們的療法而死 但，無所謂啦
Or maybe because of what we did to them. But it doesn't matter.

591
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,630
系統很完美，不是嗎？
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

592
00:59:28,871 --> 00:59:30,911
我不可能謀殺別人
I'm not going to commit murder.

593
00:59:31,207 --> 00:59:33,487
我與要殺的人從未謀面
I've never met the man I'm supposed to kill.

594
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:37,873
但一連串的事件發生之後 會導致你去謀殺他
And yet a chain of events has started that will lead you to his murder.

595
00:59:38,256 --> 00:59:40,936
-我會躲著他 -怎麼躲？你不認識他
Not if I stay away from him.  Can you avoid a man you've never met?

596
00:59:41,259 --> 00:59:44,099
-你不幫我？ -我沒辦法，誰都沒辦法
You won't help?  I can't help you. Nobody can.

597
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,110
先知從未發生錯誤
The PreCogs are never wrong.

598
00:59:49,601 --> 00:59:51,641
話說回來，偶爾
But occasionally...

599
00:59:52,271 --> 00:59:54,311
他們也會意見相左
...they do disagree.

600
00:59:55,899 --> 00:59:57,019
什麼？
What?

601
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:01,879
大多數時候 三個先知看到的都一樣
Most of the time, all three PreCogs will see an event in the same way...

602
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,039
偶爾，其中之一會不同
...but once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the others.

603
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:10,249
天啊，我怎麼不知道？
Jesus Christ. Why didn't I know about this?

604
01:00:11,165 --> 01:00:14,245
因為這些關鍵報告都被毀了
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.

605
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:15,664
為什麼？
Why?

606
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:20,639
犯罪預防中心想繼續運作 就不能讓人覺得不可靠
For Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.

607
01:00:21,009 --> 01:00:24,009
司法系統容不得絲毫懷疑
Who wants a justice system that instills doubt?

608
01:00:24,305 --> 01:00:27,105
儘管合理，卻仍舊是懷疑
It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.

609
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:31,362
你是說我冤枉過好人？
Are you saying I've haloed innocent people?

610
01:00:31,645 --> 01:00:35,245
我只是說那些被控謀殺罪名的人
I'm saying that every so often, those accused of a Precrime...

611
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:38,046
也許會有不一樣的未來
...just might have an alternate future.

612
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:42,079
伯吉斯知道關鍵報告的事嗎？
Does Burgess know about this, about this Minority Report?

613
01:00:42,448 --> 01:00:45,848
我跟拉瑪開過玩笑 我們是防罪中心的父母
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the parents of Precrime.

614
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,880
父母眼中的孩子總是完美的
Parents often see their children as they want them to be and not as they are.

615
01:00:51,249 --> 01:00:56,209
回答我的問題： 拉瑪知不知道關鍵報告？
Answer my question: Does Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?

616
01:00:56,588 --> 01:00:58,188
當然知道
Yes, of course, he knew.

617
01:00:58,423 --> 01:01:03,463
但當時我們兩人覺得無傷大雅
But at the time, we felt their existence was an insignificant variable.

618
01:01:03,846 --> 01:01:05,726
對你或許無關緊要
Insignificant to you, maybe.

619
01:01:05,972 --> 01:01:09,612
但假如我冤枉過好人呢？
But what about those people that I put away with alternate futures?

620
01:01:09,977 --> 01:01:13,497
-如果國人知道… -那麼這套系統就會崩潰
My God, if the country knew...  The system would collapse.

621
01:01:15,691 --> 01:01:18,211
-我對系統有信心 -是嗎？
I believe in that system.  Do you really?

622
01:01:18,486 --> 01:01:20,046
你想毀掉它
You wanna bring it down.

623
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,040
你會毀掉它 如果你有辦法殺死一個人
You will bring it down if you manage to kill your victim.

624
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:29,247
那等於向大眾公然宣示 預知犯罪無效
That'll be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime didn't work.

625
01:01:29,623 --> 01:01:32,463
-我不會殺任何人 -希望你堅持下去
I'm not gonna kill anybody.  Hold that thought.

626
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:36,071
-我為什麼要相信你？ -誰都不能相信
Why should I trust you?  You shouldn't trust anyone.

627
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,500
包括檢察總長 他想將系統佔為己有
Certainly not the attorney general, who wants it all for himself.

628
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,440
那位年輕聯邦幹員想篡你的位
And not the young federal agent, who wants your job.

629
01:01:42,761 --> 01:01:46,801
老頭也想保住自己畢生的結晶 誰都不能相信
Not even the old man who just wants to hang on to what he created.

630
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,420
只要找出關鍵報告
Don't trust anyone. Just find the Minority Report.

631
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,160
你說它們被毀了
You said the Minority Report is destroyed.

632
01:01:54,482 --> 01:01:58,042
紀錄被毀，原始報告還在
The record is destroyed. The original report still exists.

633
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:03,401
根據我的設計，報告產生時 它會儲存在一個秘密而安全的地方
I designed it so the report is stored in a safe place, but not declared.

634
01:02:03,783 --> 01:02:05,983
什麼安全的地方？
What safe place is that?

635
01:02:06,244 --> 01:02:09,364
有個最安全的地方
The safest place there is.

636
01:02:09,707 --> 01:02:12,547
在哪裡？
Where is it?

637
01:02:14,795 --> 01:02:18,635
在先知的體內
Inside the PreCog who predicted it.

638
01:02:23,387 --> 01:02:27,747
你只需要將它下載出來
All you have to do is download it, darling.

639
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:31,118
這麼簡單？
That's all, huh?

640
01:02:34,608 --> 01:02:37,328
走進防罪中心辦公室
Just walk into Precrime, get into the temple...

641
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:42,090
走進聖殿，侵入系統 下載關鍵報告
...somehow tap into these PreCogs and download this Minority Report.

642
01:02:42,449 --> 01:02:44,849
-假如有這報告的話 -然後走出來
If you have one.  And then walk out.

643
01:02:45,118 --> 01:02:49,438
實際上你得用跑的 不過沒錯，你必須這麼作
Actually, you'll have to run out. But yes, that's what you have to do.

644
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:52,459
你瘋了
You're insane.

645
01:02:53,168 --> 01:02:55,208
還是你認為我瘋了
Or you think I am.

646
01:02:55,462 --> 01:03:00,462
在靠近犯罪中心前 我的眼珠早被掃瞄十幾次！
I'll get eyescanned a dozen times before I get within 10 miles of Precrime.

647
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:05,483
俗語說，不入虎穴焉得虎子
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.

648
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:09,049
身為警察，抱歉 解職警察
As a policeman... Excuse me, as a former policeman...

649
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,952
我相信你認識一些人
...I'm sure that you know all sorts of people...

650
01:03:12,272 --> 01:03:15,432
可以在這方面上幫助你
...who can help you out in this regard.

651
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:24,618
很有趣，一切生物如此相似
It's funny how all living organisms are alike.

652
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:28,469
受到威脅時，壓力降臨時
When the chips are down, when the pressure is on...

653
01:03:28,789 --> 01:03:31,629
每種生物只關心一件事
...every creature on the face of the earth...

654
01:03:31,918 --> 01:03:35,238
只有一件事
...is interested in one thing and one thing only:

655
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,500
自己的生存
Its own survival.

656
01:03:40,218 --> 01:03:42,298
去找關鍵報告
Find the Minority Report.

657
01:03:47,476 --> 01:03:50,116
我怎麼知道誰才有關鍵報告？
How do I even know which one has it?

658
01:03:50,395 --> 01:03:53,595
三人中最有天賦那位
It's always in the more gifted of the three.

659
01:03:55,317 --> 01:03:57,157
到底哪一位？
Which one is that?

660
01:04:00,197 --> 01:04:01,997
女性
The female.

661
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,720
這裡，房間裡三個男人 被害人在這
We've got three men in a room. The victim is here...

662
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,079
約翰在這，不明男性站在窗外
...John is here, and this unidentified male, at the window.

663
01:04:13,419 --> 01:04:17,099
鄰近建築顯示是廉價公寓 但無法辨識地點
The adjacent building suggests public housing, which means...

664
01:04:17,423 --> 01:04:20,143
-有幾千棟這種建築 -到處都是
There's thousands like this one.  They're everywhere.

665
01:04:20,427 --> 01:04:23,227
我們還有22小時
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow for another 22 hours.

666
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:25,633
你不能坐約翰的椅子
This is Chief Anderton's space.

667
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:27,730
-他走了 -他會回來
He's not here.  He'll be back.

668
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:31,576
我很懷疑 我猜他躲在貧民窟裡
I doubt that. I'm betting he's somewhere in the Sprawl.

669
01:04:31,897 --> 01:04:35,577
躲開電子廣告牌掃瞄身份的地方
He's smart enough to go where billboards can't ID him.

670
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:38,181
越少消費者就越少掃瞄器
There's fewer consumers, which means fewer scanners.

671
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:42,525
-他為什麼不遠走高飛？ -他自認為無辜
Why won't he just run?  Because he thinks he's innocent.

672
01:04:43,951 --> 01:04:45,711
重點放在貧民窟
We concentrate on the Sprawl.

673
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:48,873
低空偵搜 搭配二支蜘蛛小組
We do flyovers in ships, with two spyder teams on the ground.

674
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:53,325
追蹤任何有眼睛和心跳的生物
Thermal scan the entire area. Read anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

675
01:05:09,353 --> 01:05:10,593
她在哪裡？
Where is she?

676
01:05:29,165 --> 01:05:34,925
毫無預警就開槍，我早知道了
Started blowing buttons for no reason whatsoever, and I knew that.

677
01:05:38,758 --> 01:05:40,758
該死的感冒！
This damn cold.

678
01:05:42,012 --> 01:05:46,092
別擔心 即使我塞只死貓在你胸腔裡
Don't worry. I could cut open your chest and sew a dead cat in there...

679
01:05:46,433 --> 01:05:50,913
你也不會被感染 這抗生素十分厲害
...you wouldn't get an infection. Not with the antibios I'll shoot into you.

680
01:05:51,271 --> 01:05:52,711
那我就放心了
That's comforting.

681
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:56,220
你知道 我不能只給你換新的虹膜
You do understand I can't just give you new irises?

682
01:05:56,527 --> 01:05:57,927
請不要碰
Please, don't touch.

683
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,954
傷疤被掃瞄到，警鈴就會響
Because the scanners would read the new scar tissue, alarms will go off...

684
01:06:02,283 --> 01:06:04,763
帶槍的大個子就會出現
...and large men with guns will appear.

685
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:09,009
那是什麼東西？
What was that?

686
01:06:09,248 --> 01:06:10,368
那是什麼？
What was that?

687
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:15,023
-麻醉劑，讓你乖乖就範… -你習慣偷襲病患嗎？
It's anesthesia. It's all downhill...  You always sneak up on your patients?

688
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:19,340
錢沒賺到，我不會害你
You wouldn't break the hand of a violinist before the concert.

689
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:21,236
別緊張
Please, relax.

690
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:30,929
我必須把你的眼睛整個拿出來
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll have to remove your eyes completely.

691
01:06:31,313 --> 01:06:32,433
我知道
I know.

692
01:06:33,399 --> 01:06:37,439
-然後換一對新的 -舊的我要保存起來
I have to replace them with new ones.  I know. But I wanna keep the old ones.

693
01:06:37,779 --> 01:06:41,299
-為什麼？ -身體髮膚受之父母
Why?  Because my mother gave them to me.

694
01:06:41,616 --> 01:06:43,896
你留著也沒用，又不能賣
What's it to you? You can't resell them.

695
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,960
隨便你，出錢的是你
Whatever you say. It's your money.

696
01:06:54,338 --> 01:06:58,818
我美麗的助手凡艾可小姐
Let me introduce my gorgeous assistant, Miss Van Eyck.

697
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:24,021
-錢並不多 -能動用的只有這些
This is not a lot of money.  It's all that I could safely move.

698
01:07:27,122 --> 01:07:28,682
好吧
Okay.

699
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:35,784
-你給我打哪種藥？ -微笑劑
What did you give me?  Smile medicine.

700
01:07:36,089 --> 01:07:38,489
告訴你也無妨 老朋友了
Tell you what, since we go way back...

701
01:07:38,759 --> 01:07:42,879
我給你打個折扣
...why don't I give you my old pal discount? What do you say?

702
01:07:43,222 --> 01:07:45,382
你不記得我了吧？
You don't remember me, do you?

703
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:49,001
-我們認識嗎？ -認識
We know each other?  Yes, we do.

704
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:51,275
在哪認識？特區？
From where? D.C.?

705
01:07:51,523 --> 01:07:55,923
-巴爾的摩，城東 -巴爾的摩？認識很久了？
Baltimore. The East Side.  Baltimore? We go way back.

706
01:07:56,277 --> 01:08:00,157
所羅門艾迪醫師，整形外科
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D. I was a plastic surgeon.

707
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:05,530
我專治燒傷病患，特別是女性
You remember? Specialized in burn victims, mostly women.

708
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:09,433
-我逮捕過你 -沒錯
I put you away.  Yeah, you did.

709
01:08:11,376 --> 01:08:13,536
你還拍攝錄像帶
You made those tapes.

710
01:08:13,796 --> 01:08:16,276
業餘表演藝術
They were performance pieces.

711
01:08:17,674 --> 01:08:21,674
-那些病患是你放的火 -我也滅火！
You set your patients on fire.  I put them out.

712
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:27,173
有些人跑得不夠快，換個話題
Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?

713
01:08:29,145 --> 01:08:34,585
未來比過去有趣多了 不是嗎？
The future's so much more interesting than the past, don't you think?

714
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:41,409
恐怕凡艾可小姐愛上你了
Miss Van Eyck. I'm afraid she's already smitten.

715
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:46,318
她一直盯著你的「眼睛」
She only has eyes for you.

716
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:51,178
你一定在想，我怎麼願意幫你？
I know what you're thinking, John: How can I do what I do now?

717
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:56,022
我花很多時間在監獄圖書館
Let's say that I spent an awful lot of time in the prison library.

718
01:08:56,382 --> 01:09:01,382
那是逃避監獄生活的好辦法
That was a great way to avoid the more unpleasant aspects of prison life.

719
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:05,003
囚禁是真正的教育
Confinement was a real education, a real...

720
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,708
真正教人大開「眼」界
...eyeopener.

721
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:16,273
那是真正的啟蒙，有什麼比得上…
For true enlightenment, there's nothing quite like...

722
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:19,810
例如跟兇狠的重罪犯一起淋浴
...well, let's say, taking a shower while this large fellow...

723
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:23,517
高大到拿一把鐵錘也打不倒 聽他在你耳邊呢喃…
...with an attitude you can't knock down with a hammer...

724
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,907
「噢，南希」
...whispers in your ear, "Oh, Nancy. "

725
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:29,683
好玩喔，多謝你讓我入獄
That was a lot of fun. Thank you for putting me there...

726
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,080
拓展我的生命領域
...and giving me the opportunity to get to know myself so much better.

727
01:09:34,422 --> 01:09:36,782
為了答謝你的恩澤
And now to return the favor.

728
01:09:48,269 --> 01:09:51,229
-你的作品？ -是的
This your work?  Yes.

729
01:09:52,024 --> 01:09:53,544
我很喜歡
I like it.

730
01:09:53,776 --> 01:09:56,736
-咖啡要加什麼？ -奶精和糖
How do you take your coffee?  Cream and sugar.

731
01:09:57,029 --> 01:09:59,469
-我沒有奶精 -糖就可以
I don't have any cream. Sorry.  Just sugar then.

732
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,020
-你跟約翰常來？ -以前
You and John ever come here?  We used to.

733
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,045
他現在不在這裡吧？
He's not here now, is he?

734
01:10:06,288 --> 01:10:08,048
我不得不問
I had to ask.

735
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:13,382
-糖也沒有了 -謝謝
I don't have any sugar either.  Thank you.

736
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:16,511
-他沒跟你聯絡？ -沒有
He hasn't tried to contact you?  No.

737
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,320
他有沒有提過裡歐克羅？
Did he ever mention the name Leo Crow?

738
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:22,354
沒有，我已不太跟約翰通話
No, but I don't talk to John much anymore.

739
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:26,079
-沒看過他住的地方？ -那是我們以前的家
So you haven't seen his apartment.  That was our apartment.

740
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:29,233
最近有去嗎？到處都是這玩意
Have you been there recently? It's full of these.

741
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:33,961
-他嗑藥多久了？ -從失去我們的兒子以後
How long has he been doping?  Since right after we lost our son.

742
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:39,558
你是說他弄丟你的兒子以後？
那不是誰的錯
You mean after he lost your son.  It was nobody's fault.

743
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:45,367
但是，當時約翰 也在公共游泳池陪他
But John was with him at the public pool.

744
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:48,393
離婚書上，你說約翰企圖自殺
You said in your divorce papers that John tried to kill himself.

745
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:51,866
-那並不是自殺，我很後悔 -不然約翰做了什麼？
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  What was it then?

746
01:10:52,169 --> 01:10:56,089
FBI找到我兒子的涼鞋
The FBI found something that belonged to my son, a sandal.

747
01:10:56,424 --> 01:10:57,944
約翰很激動…
John was upset. He...

748
01:10:58,218 --> 01:11:01,058
他拿著槍看家庭錄像帶
He took out his gun and watched home movies.

749
01:11:01,346 --> 01:11:05,466
-文件上都寫著 -天花板被他打個洞，又怎樣？
This is all in your statement.  He shot a hole in the ceiling. So what?

750
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:09,329
換做你，你會怎麼樣？
You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.

751
01:11:09,896 --> 01:11:14,776
你離開約翰是因為 他埋首在防罪中心的工作裡
Lamar thinks you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.

752
01:11:15,486 --> 01:11:20,006
我離開他是因為 一看到他，我就想到兒子
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.

753
01:11:21,075 --> 01:11:25,355
靠近他就聞到我兒子的味道
Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.

754
01:11:25,705 --> 01:11:28,225
所以我才離開他
That's why I left him.

755
01:11:29,334 --> 01:11:31,454
你可以走了
And now you can leave.

756
01:11:33,504 --> 01:11:36,544
12小時內繃帶不要拿掉
Don't take the bandages off for 12 hours.

757
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:45,591
拿下會瞎掉，懂嗎？
If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Understand?

758
01:11:46,894 --> 01:11:50,734
冰箱有牛奶 葛莉塔為你做了個三明治
In the fridge, there's milk. Greta made you a sandwich.

759
01:11:51,065 --> 01:11:53,785
多喝水
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

760
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:55,988
怎麼找洗手間？
How do I find the bathroom?

761
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,970
洗手間？右手那條線
The bathroom? Now that's your right hand.

762
01:12:02,661 --> 01:12:05,181
左手的是廚房
The kitchen is your left.

763
01:12:07,498 --> 01:12:10,218
不要抓，千萬不要抓！
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

764
01:12:10,752 --> 01:12:15,232
看老朋友份上，送你個禮物
Seeing as we're being pals, I'll give you a bonus that may come in handy.

765
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:19,790
短效麻痹酵素，注射在下巴
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme. You're gonna shoot this under your chin.

766
01:12:20,304 --> 01:12:23,544
-這是什麼東西？ -它會讓你的臉腫得像豬頭
What is this?  It'll turn your pretty face into mush.

767
01:12:23,849 --> 01:12:26,169
別人就認不出來了
People won't even recognize you.

768
01:12:26,435 --> 01:12:30,595
30分鐘後恢復正常 但你會痛不欲生
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again. But it'll hurt like you've never felt.

769
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:34,780
我把它放進你的寶貝袋
I'm gonna put this in your goodybag, together with your...

770
01:12:35,153 --> 01:12:36,913
跟老眼珠放一起
...leftovers.

771
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:44,096
我定個時間，明天鈴響 拆繃帶離開
I'm setting up a timer. When it rings, you can remove the bandages and leave.

772
01:12:44,496 --> 01:12:48,296
-不能提早，不然… -會瞎掉，我知道
But not before then, or you will...  Go blind. I know.

773
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,465
不要抓
Don't scratch.

774
01:12:51,503 --> 01:12:56,063
我們共同的朋友送的小禮物
A little something from a mutual friend of ours.

775
01:13:32,963 --> 01:13:35,443
12小時內不要拆繃帶
Don 't take the bandages off for 12 hours.

776
01:13:36,508 --> 01:13:41,068
提早拆會瞎掉，懂吧？
If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Understand?

777
01:14:01,952 --> 01:14:06,552
-2516秒，新紀錄 -是世界紀錄嗎？
25. 16 seconds. That's a new record.  Is that a world record?

778
01:14:06,915 --> 01:14:10,275
世界紀錄？個人最佳成績
Is it a world record? It's a personal best.

779
01:14:10,586 --> 01:14:13,506
-換我幫你計時 -你在開玩笑
Now I wanna time you.  You gotta be kidding.

780
01:14:13,798 --> 01:14:16,638
我不可能打破2516秒
There's no way I can beat 25. 16 seconds.

781
01:14:16,926 --> 01:14:19,646
鯨魚可以憋氣多久？
How long can a whale hold its breath?

782
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:22,009
大約20分鐘
For about 20 minutes.

783
01:14:22,265 --> 01:14:25,465
-我們來打破鯨魚的紀錄 -好
So we gotta beat the whale.  Okay.

784
01:14:27,312 --> 01:14:29,632
我們來打破鯨魚的紀錄
We gotta beat the whale.

785
01:14:30,357 --> 01:14:31,637
拿著
Here you go.

786
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:35,578
20分鐘，要不要去買冰淇淋？
It's gonna be 20 minutes. You sure you don't wanna go for an ice cream?

787
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:38,784
因為我要打破鯨魚的紀錄
Because you know I'm gonna beat that whale.

788
01:14:39,324 --> 01:14:40,884
-好了嗎？ -幫我倒數
Ready?  Give me the count.

789
01:14:41,118 --> 01:14:43,278
3，2，1，開始
Three, two, one, go!

790
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:02,537
西恩？
Sean?

791
01:15:05,393 --> 01:15:06,553
西恩？
Sean?

792
01:15:09,564 --> 01:15:10,844
西恩？
Sean.

793
01:15:17,406 --> 01:15:19,086
你們有沒有看到
Have you seen...?

794
01:15:20,701 --> 01:15:25,021
我在找兒子，他穿紅色泳褲
I'm looking for my son. Have you seen a boy in a red bathing suit?

795
01:15:26,874 --> 01:15:30,234
你們有看到我兒子嗎？ 他穿紅色泳褲
You seen my boy? He's wearing a red bathing suit.

796
01:16:56,634 --> 01:16:58,067
警網最前線

797
01:17:18,449 --> 01:17:23,169
傑德，準備熱感掃瞄 北鮑威爾街的所有住戶
Jad, we're ready to begin thermal scan on all residences on North Powell.

798
01:17:24,414 --> 01:17:26,814
你一定很喜歡我，佛萊契？
You must really like me, don't you?

799
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,843
所以你要我在這任務上搭檔
That's why you asked to partner with me on this sortie.

800
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:31,528
我覺得你是好同事
You're swell company.

801
01:17:31,754 --> 01:17:34,914
還是說你信不過我和老隊長？
It's not that you don't trust me to be alone with the chief, is it?

802
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,377
你覺得我會和他聊天閒晃？
That you think I might, you know, futz with him?

803
01:17:37,635 --> 01:17:41,355
我只想看他抓著你 撞破另一棟建築物
No, I just wanna watch him use your body to sandblast another building.

804
01:17:41,682 --> 01:17:42,682
艾文納，開始
Evanna, go.

805
01:17:43,184 --> 01:17:46,464
顯示有27個溫熱物體
I show 27 warm bodies.

806
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:49,490
收到，27個溫熱物體
Roger that. Confirmed, 27 warm bodies.

807
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:54,534
-四隻蜘蛛？每層樓一隻？ -放八隻，我想早點吃飯
Four spyders, one per floor?  Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

808
01:18:10,128 --> 01:18:15,128
931鮑爾街居民注意 這是預知犯罪中心的佛萊契警官
Residents of 931 Powell, this is Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime.

809
01:18:15,509 --> 01:18:20,589
根據犯罪防治法條授權 我們派遣蜘蛛搜索大樓
Under authority of P.C. section 6409, we are deploying spyders into your complex.

810
01:18:22,016 --> 01:18:24,296
媽媽，我好害怕
Mom, I'm scared.

811
01:18:24,602 --> 01:18:27,002
媽媽，我好害怕，媽媽
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

812
01:18:27,271 --> 01:18:31,071
眼睛張開，躺著不要動
That's gonna scan you. Keep your eyes open. Stay still.

813
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:33,161
-不要動 -很討厭
It's okay.  I don't like it.

814
01:18:33,403 --> 01:18:35,403
不要動，不要動
Stay still. Stay still.

815
01:18:59,012 --> 01:19:00,132
來！
Come on!

816
01:19:00,347 --> 01:19:02,827
你又出去偷腥！
You stepped out on me for the last time.

817
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,620
我跟你說過我去了哪裡！
I told you where I was.

818
01:19:04,852 --> 01:19:07,652
騙子！你昨晚跟那婊子在一起
You're a nogood liar. I know you was with that ho.

819
01:19:07,938 --> 01:19:09,498
你很幸運我們…
You're lucky we...

820
01:19:13,778 --> 01:19:15,778
不要再煩了！
Leave me alone!

821
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,674
一個不見了
We lost one.

822
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:37,871
收到，可能是貓跳過窗戶
Roger that. Maybe it was a cat jumping through a window.

823
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:40,050
這貓還真大
It's an awful big cat.

824
01:20:40,285 --> 01:20:41,605
佛萊契
Fletcher.

825
01:20:42,663 --> 01:20:44,543
我去看看
I'll go check it out.

826
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:26,320
他們哭了！太恐怖了！
They're crying their eyes out. You terrified them.

827
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:28,745
靠近我，他們更會嚇死
Keep your kids away from me.

828
01:21:44,185 --> 01:21:48,385
等等，大貓回來了 可能是醉漢，醒不過來
The big cat's back. What do you think? A drunk, maybe can't wake up?

829
01:21:48,732 --> 01:21:51,252
也可能是某人想躲過搜查
Or a guy who doesn't want to get read.

830
01:21:51,526 --> 01:21:54,006
請安靜，回到室內
Folks, be quiet, go back inside.

831
01:22:04,999 --> 01:22:07,119
安靜，把門關上！
Be quiet and close the door.

832
01:22:14,258 --> 01:22:16,458
查出身份了，不是他
We got an ID. It's not him.

833
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:21,232
-不要太張揚 -去吃飯吧
Standing down.  Let's eat.

834
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:37,419
佛萊契，你來看看
Fletcher, take a look.

835
01:22:39,201 --> 01:22:42,281
房間裡有四人，不是三人
There's four people in this room, not three.

836
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:45,940
四人？安德頓，克羅 和一個戴太陽眼鏡的人
Four? There's Anderton, Crow and the man in sunglasses.

837
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:49,411
他就是外面戴太陽眼鏡那位
The man in the sunglasses is outside the window.

838
01:22:52,007 --> 01:22:56,487
這裡還有一個人 在鏡子裡
There's also someone here in the mirror.

839
01:22:57,345 --> 01:22:59,385
確定是女性
Definitely female.

840
01:22:59,932 --> 01:23:04,012
犯罪防治項目經聯邦政府同意 在2046年開始施行
The Precrime program began in 2046 with a federal grant.

841
01:23:04,353 --> 01:23:09,393
經過九年後，哥倫比亞區 成了美國最安全的城市
And now, nine years later, D.C. is the safest city in America.

842
01:23:09,273 --> 01:23:12,056
為什麼？因為犯罪防治有效
Why? Because Precrime works.

843
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:15,439
它取代了傳統的警察系統
Precrime has eliminated the need for conventional detectives.

844
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:20,380
未來受害者被預知並受保護
What happens now is the verification and protection of future victims.

845
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:22,305
可以看看先知嗎？
Can we see the PreCogs?

846
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,859
先知天生具有強大能力 他們必須處在與世隔絕的環境
They have such a powerful gift, they're kept in peaceful seclusion...

847
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,130
以免受到外界的干擾
...so as not to be distracted.

848
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:33,699
這裡可以看到他們的生活
This display should give you some idea of what their daily life is like.

849
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:38,315
先知每年收到八百萬封信
The PreCogs get over 8 million letters every year.

850
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,559
比聖誕老公公收到的還多
That's more than Santa Claus gets.

851
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:44,328
各自擁有臥室、電視和健身房
Each PreCog has their own bedroom, TV and weight room.

852
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,725
當先知真好
It's wonderful to be a PreCog.

853
01:24:11,668 --> 01:24:14,654
我媽媽的新男朋友來訪
My mom's new boyfriend came over again last night.

854
01:24:14,969 --> 01:24:17,129
他腦袋不太靈光
He's just not very intelligent.

855
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:22,987
媽媽不讓我在房間裡吃飯 他逼我聽她嘮叨個沒完
My mom wouldn't let me eat upstairs. I had to listen to him go on and on.

856
01:24:31,945 --> 01:24:33,625
可惡，可惡
Shit!

857
01:24:51,548 --> 01:24:54,268
眼珠掃瞄：約翰安德頓，允許進入
Eyedent: John Anderton. Approved for entry.

858
01:24:58,472 --> 01:25:02,232
…我會養，因為我很會照顧你們
Which I told her I'd be able to do. I'm so good at taking care of you.

859
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,920
但她說我會不負責，亂講
But she thinks I'll be irresponsible. It's ridiculous because...

860
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:13,249
不！你不能進來，你想幹嘛？
You can't be in here. What are you doing here?

861
01:25:17,868 --> 01:25:20,588
別跑，老頭，誰讓你進來？
Easy there, oldtimer. Who cleared you?

862
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:22,830
-你不能進來 -聽我說，華利
You're not allowed here.  Listen, Wally.

863
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:24,761
-我認識你嗎？ -我喜歡你
Do I know you?  I like you.

864
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,960
我不想動手動腳
So I don't wanna have to kick you or hit you.

865
01:25:28,254 --> 01:25:30,654
只要你肯幫我
But only if you promise to help me.

866
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:33,764
嗨，約翰
Hi, John.

867
01:25:42,185 --> 01:25:44,505
他像誰？
Who does that look like to you?

868
01:25:46,105 --> 01:25:47,785
不知道
I don't know.

869
01:25:51,695 --> 01:25:55,815
是亞嘉莎 他到這裡來找她
It's Agatha. He's coming here to get her.

870
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,160
-這些是她的預視影像？ -我正在回轉
Are these all of her previsions?  I'm rewinding her right now.

871
01:26:04,124 --> 01:26:06,404
幫我找出裡歐克羅的謀殺案
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

872
01:26:06,669 --> 01:26:10,909
沒有次序，按照她的原始輸出
They don't come out in any order. I'm getting them as she's giving them.

873
01:26:14,177 --> 01:26:15,937
看到了嗎？
Can you see?

874
01:26:29,442 --> 01:26:32,162
-他在裡面 -他戴著面具之類的東西
He's inside.  He has some kind of mask on.

875
01:26:32,446 --> 01:26:34,326
-門被他封住了 -糟了
He sealed the door.  Shit!

876
01:26:34,572 --> 01:26:37,372
聖殿裡不准用武器！ 用泡沫膠
Nobody fires a weapon inside the temple. Use bindfoam.

877
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:40,979
-有別的出口嗎？ -所有門都守住了
Is there another way out of there?  All the doors are covered.

878
01:26:41,289 --> 01:26:46,689
約翰，離開乳液槽！ 不要靠近乳液槽，約翰！
John, move away from the tank. Move away from the tank, John.

879
01:27:04,104 --> 01:27:05,944
為什麼要帶走先知？
What does he want with a PreCog?

880
01:27:05,609 --> 01:27:09,270
你說呢？ 他想殺誰就沒人知道啦！
So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing.

881
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:14,608
但還有兩位 華利！其它兩位還有功能吧？
Well, there's still the other two. The other two can still function, right?

882
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:21,030
不！他們的心智共通 三個一起才有預測功能
They're a hive mind. It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.

883
01:27:23,415 --> 01:27:25,255
他們再也看不到兇殺案？
They can't see murders anymore?

884
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:29,181
失去一個男性可能還可以 但亞嘉莎是關鍵
Agatha, she's the key. She's the one they listen to...

885
01:27:29,506 --> 01:27:31,626
她的能力最強，其它人都聽她的
...the one with the most talent.

886
01:27:31,883 --> 01:27:35,163
-她會照顧其它兩位 -天啊
She takes care of the other two.  Jesus.

887
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:39,390
-把她找回來 -查出水管的流向
Please bring her back.  Every team underground, now!

888
01:27:39,209 --> 01:27:42,684
-沒有用的 -在蓄水池攔下他
It doesn't matter. He wins.  We'll stop him.

889
01:27:42,978 --> 01:27:47,658
他殺克羅時她也在 她已經是他未來的一部分
She's with him when he kills Crow. She's already a part of his future.

890
01:27:48,024 --> 01:27:51,264
傑德，想辦法查出那個房間
Jad, put everything you've got into finding that room, and we stop a murder.

891
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:54,690
-還有多少時間？ -還有…
How much time have we got, Gordon?  We've got...

892
01:27:55,158 --> 01:27:57,598
51分30秒
...51 minutes, 30 seconds.

893
01:27:59,871 --> 01:28:02,751
你冷嗎？ 你聽得懂嗎？
You cold? Can you understand me?

894
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:06,841
冷嗎？ 你在顫抖是因為注射藥劑
Are you cold? The shivers, it's the drugs we gave you.

895
01:28:07,170 --> 01:28:11,290
很快就會消退了 對不起，我需要你幫忙
It should wear off soon. I'm sorry. I need your help.

896
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:15,272
你體內有我要的信息 我得知道怎麼輸出
You contain information. I need to know how to get at it.

897
01:28:16,471 --> 01:28:19,311
可以告訴我誰是裡歐克羅嗎？

是的，眼前的事物就是現在
Yes, this is all happening right now.

901
01:28:29,318 --> 01:28:31,438
我們會去到公共場所
I'm taking you some place in public...

902
01:28:31,695 --> 01:28:34,415
這表示我得幫你找些別的衣服
...which means you need something else to wear.

903
01:28:34,699 --> 01:28:38,579
我好累 我厭倦了未來
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.

一般消費者買不到這種裝備

Or just some good, clean fun.

921
01:30:20,226 --> 01:30:23,106
高潮迭起，但絕不得心臟病
It's a big rush, but you come out without a heart attack.

922
01:30:23,395 --> 01:30:26,115
我想殺我老闆
I wanna kill my boss.

923
01:30:27,734 --> 01:30:28,854

Yeah, being concertmaster for the Philadelphia Symphony...

926
01:30:37,453 --> 01:30:39,133
很受歡迎
...is a popular choice.

927
01:30:39,371 --> 01:30:42,051
-不，我想殺我老闆 -變態！
I wanna kill my boss.  You sick bastard.

928
01:30:42,332 --> 01:30:45,132
你這種人唯恐天下不亂

Hello, honey pie. I'm impressed. You're on the lam...

933

還有時間搞艷遇

She's a PreCog.  Oh, yeah, okay.

935
01:31:07,567 --> 01:31:09,727
-是啊 -她是先知
That's right.  She's a PreCog.

936
01:31:11,613 --> 01:31:14,893
你把先知帶來這裡
You brought a PreCog here.

937
01:31:28,964 --> 01:31:30,884
我的老天啊

Are you reading my mind right now?  Get up.

I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do. I swear I didn't do that stuff I did.

She has information inside her. I need you to get it out.

941
01:31:46,733 --> 01:31:49,813
不行，連怎麼下手我都不知道
No way. I wouldn't even know where to begin.

942
01:31:50,112 --> 01:31:53,432
對艾蓮娜表妹純粹只是幻想
Those thoughts about my cousin were just thoughts.

943
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,060
-你因為嚴重黑客行為被捕兩次 -又怎樣？
You've been busted for felony hacking.  So?

944
01:31:56,327 --> 01:31:58,647
用黑客技術侵入她

怎麼弄？打她的頭不成？
How do I slow this down? I should hit her on the head?

952
01:32:56,222 --> 01:32:59,182
-有錄下來嗎？ -媽的
Are you recording this?  Shit.

求求你
Please.

1018
01:39:54,452 --> 01:39:58,994

我兒子
My son.

1028
01:43:08,813 --> 01:43:14,884
過去六年的每一天 我只想著兩件事：
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things:

1029
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:20,611
第一是我兒子長大成人的模樣
The first is what my son would look like if he were alive today...

1030
01:43:21,292 --> 01:43:25,476
在街上遇到，我認得出他嗎？
...if I would recognize him if I saw him on the street.

1031
01:43:28,633 --> 01:43:32,779
第二是怎麼對付綁走他的人？
And the second is what I would do to the man who took him.

1032
01:43:37,242 --> 01:43:39,371
你說對了
You're right.

1033
01:43:40,278 --> 01:43:42,495
沒有人設計陷害我
I'm not being set up.

1034
01:43:45,149 --> 01:43:48,096
你得帶我回家
You have to take me home.

1035
01:43:53,291 --> 01:43:57,628
你說過，沒有關鍵報告
You said so yourself. There is no Minority Report.

1036
01:43:57,428 --> 01:44:00,597
未來是唯一的
I don't have an alternate future.

1037
01:44:01,366 --> 01:44:04,320
我一定會殺掉這個人
I am going to kill this man.

1038
01:44:06,604 --> 01:44:11,253
你還有選擇 其它人沒看過未來
You still have a choice. The others never saw their future.

1039
01:44:11,009 --> 01:44:14,116
你還有選擇！
You still have a choice.

1040
01:44:14,579 --> 01:44:17,541
-裡歐克羅？ -你是什麼人？
Leo Crow?  Who the hell are you?

1041
01:44:23,154 --> 01:44:25,174
六年前在巴爾的摩，你在
Six years ago, Baltimore...

1042
01:44:24,822 --> 01:44:29,042
法蘭西公共泳池綁走一個小孩
...you grabbed a kid at Francis public pool on the West End.

1043
01:44:28,893 --> 01:44:33,568
有嗎？我一點都不記得
Did I? I don't remember anything about that place.

1044
01:44:37,302 --> 01:44:39,592
我是誰？我是誰？
Who am I? Who am I?

1045
01:44:39,304 --> 01:44:41,754
你知道我是誰嗎？
Do you know who I am?

1046
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:45,403
-你是某人的父親 -他名叫西恩！
You're somebody's father.  His name is Sean!

1047
01:44:47,045 --> 01:44:48,592
西恩！
Sean!

1048
01:44:48,946 --> 01:44:52,471
我跟他說我是警察 我請他幫忙
I told him I was a policeman and needed his help.

1049
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:57,604
我唱歌給他聽 還買了個胡椒餅給他
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song. I bought him a pretzel.

1050
01:44:57,388 --> 01:45:00,018
他很開心，他很開心
He was happy. He was happy.

1051
01:44:59,957 --> 01:45:03,322
他還活著嗎？還活著嗎？ 他在哪裡？
Is he alive? He's alive. Where have you got him?

1052
01:45:03,027 --> 01:45:06,809
他好嗎？ 他在哪，賤種？！
Is he all right? Tell me, you fuck, where is he?!

1053
01:45:06,531 --> 01:45:10,993
裝在桶子裡，沉進大海
I put him in a barrel. I sunk him in the bay.

1054
01:45:10,768 --> 01:45:14,325
它又浮上來 我抱他出來
He floated back up. I took him out.

1055
01:45:14,072 --> 01:45:17,702
我很溫柔，我很溫柔
I was gentle. I was gentle.

1056
01:45:18,309 --> 01:45:20,553
我對他很溫柔
I was gentle.

1057
01:45:25,016 --> 01:45:26,790
對不起
I'm sorry.

1058
01:45:26,484 --> 01:45:28,170
對不起
I'm sorry.

1059
01:45:27,852 --> 01:45:29,587
對不起
I'm sorry.

1060
01:45:29,187 --> 01:45:30,923
對不起
I'm sorry.

1061
01:45:30,588 --> 01:45:33,580
真的很對不起
I'm so very sorry.

1062
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:38,254
你怎麼可以這樣對待我兒子？
How could you do that to my...?

1063
01:46:10,228 --> 01:46:12,964
你可以選擇
You can choose.

1064
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:18,325
你還可以選擇
You can choose.

1065
01:46:26,244 --> 01:46:27,506
警示

1066
01:46:36,554 --> 01:46:39,723
你有權保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

1067
01:46:39,557 --> 01:46:44,606
你所說的話可能成為不利證詞
Anything you say or do can be used against you in a court of law.

1068
01:46:44,896 --> 01:46:47,865
你有權聘請辯護律師
You have the right to an attorney...

1069
01:46:47,598 --> 01:46:52,377
代為回答任何詢問
...now and during any further questioning.

1070
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:55,485
如果你請不起律師
If you can't afford an attorney...

1071
01:46:57,208 --> 01:46:59,730
我們將為你指派一位
...we will appoint one.

1072
01:47:00,978 --> 01:47:04,247
瞭解你的權利了嗎？
Do you understand these rights?

1073
01:47:04,749 --> 01:47:07,440
你不殺我？
You're not gonna kill me?

1074
01:47:09,754 --> 01:47:14,444
-你瞭解你的權利了嗎？ -你不殺我？
Do you understand these rights?  You're not gonna kill me?

1075
01:47:16,928 --> 01:47:21,379
不按照計劃進行 我家人什麼都得不到
If you don't go through with this, my family gets nothing.

1076
01:47:21,132 --> 01:47:25,872
你該殺我啊！ 他說你會的
You're supposed to kill me. He said you would.

1077
01:47:26,737 --> 01:47:29,501
他？他是誰？
He? Who's he?

1078
01:47:29,173 --> 01:47:32,522
我不知道 他打電話到監獄給我
I don't know. He called me in my cell.

1079
01:47:32,210 --> 01:47:36,927
他說我答應的話，我會獲釋 家人可以得到一筆錢
He told me I'd be released if I went along, and my family would be cared for.

1080
01:47:36,681 --> 01:47:38,870
答應做什麼？
If you did what?

1081
01:47:38,516 --> 01:47:40,425
答應做什麼？
If you did what?

1082
01:47:41,552 --> 01:47:45,509
假裝殺了你兒子，清楚嗎？
If I acted like I killed your kid. Okay?

1083
01:47:46,824 --> 01:47:49,445
假裝殺我兒子？
If you killed my kid?

1084
01:47:49,126 --> 01:47:53,340
你不殺我，我家人什麼都沒有
Look, you don't kill me, my family gets nothing. Okay?

1085
01:47:53,531 --> 01:47:56,321
照片哪裡來的？
What about the pictures?

1086
01:47:56,567 --> 01:48:00,924
假的，他給我的
They're fake. He gave them to me.

1087
01:48:00,872 --> 01:48:03,822
聽我說…
Now, listen to me. You...

1088
01:48:03,574 --> 01:48:07,051
跟我說是誰布的局？
You tell me: Who was it that set this up?

1089
01:48:07,812 --> 01:48:10,265
我不知道
I don't know.

1090
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:12,680
-動手啊！ -我再問一次
Come on.  I'm asking you again:

1091
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:16,012
-誰雇你的？ -我沒看過他的臉
Who put you up to this?  I didn't see his face.

1092
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:18,070
說出來，我家人什麼都得不到
I tell you who, and my family gets nothing.

1093
01:48:17,722 --> 01:48:20,433
-跟我說 -殺了我
Who made you do this?  Kill me.

1094
01:48:20,091 --> 01:48:22,930
-動手殺了我 -說
You can do this. Kill me.  Tell me.

1095
01:48:22,627 --> 01:48:26,232
-殺我 -裡歐，槍放開
Kill me.  Leo, let go of the gun.

1096
01:48:25,930 --> 01:48:28,850
槍放掉，不會有事
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1097
01:48:30,568 --> 01:48:35,037
槍放掉，對 槍放掉
Let go of the gun. That's it. Let go of the gun.

1098
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:38,540
你不殺我
You're not gonna kill me.

1099
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:41,611
-再見，克羅 -安德頓，等等！
Goodbye, Crow.  Anderton, wait a sec...!

1100
01:48:55,226 --> 01:48:57,690
-你看到了嗎？ -退後！
Did you see it?  Stay back!

1101
01:48:57,395 --> 01:49:00,137
發生什麼事了？
What's happening down there?

1102
01:49:00,698 --> 01:49:02,795
謀殺！
Murder!

1103
01:49:02,567 --> 01:49:05,072
謀殺！
Murder!

1104
01:49:06,404 --> 01:49:08,347
不合常理
Doesn't make sense.

1105
01:49:07,972 --> 01:49:12,494
如果你是殺小孩兇手 會隨便展示照片？
If you were a child killer, would you leave these photos out?

1106
01:49:12,243 --> 01:49:14,828
或許是安德頓拿出來的
Anderton might have found them.

1107
01:49:14,512 --> 01:49:17,880
-你以前在哪裡服務？ -財政部
What kind of cop were you before this?  Treasury agent.

1108
01:49:17,582 --> 01:49:22,167
你第一次到兇案現場？ 我以前在重案組
This will be your first murder scene? I worked homicide before federal.

1109
01:49:21,919 --> 01:49:24,465
這正是所謂的「過度證據」
This is an orgy of evidence.

1110
01:49:24,121 --> 01:49:28,596
-猜猜我遇過幾次過度證據的案子？ -幾次？
Know how many orgies I had as a cop?  How many?

1111
01:49:28,359 --> 01:49:30,208
一次也沒有
None.

1112
01:49:34,799 --> 01:49:37,234
這全是安排好的
This was all arranged.

1113
01:49:36,901 --> 01:49:42,399
今天發生了犯罪預防中心 開始六年後的首樁兇殺案
Today we saw the first murder in the six years of the Precrime experiment.

1114
01:49:42,173 --> 01:49:45,336
不幸，悲劇是因為人為疏失
Sadly enough, this failure was human.

1115
01:49:45,042 --> 01:49:48,812
保護小組未能及時攔阻
The protection team simply didn't get there in time.

1116
01:49:48,512 --> 01:49:53,956
但兇案本身 跟先知預測的完全吻合
But the murder itself happened exactly as the PreCogs predicted it would.

1117
01:49:53,751 --> 01:49:58,130
我們可以掀開一些 預犯系統的神秘面紗
Today's event put a human face on the Precrime system.

1118
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:02,659
丹尼威妥來電 他說極為重要
Danny Witwer's on the phone. He says it's important.

1119
01:50:04,428 --> 01:50:06,566
拉瑪？
Lamar?

1120
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:15,767
-什麼事？ -出問題了
What?  There's something wrong.

1121
01:50:15,506 --> 01:50:19,981
我們追錯對像 電話不方便說
We're chasing the wrong man. I don 't wanna say over the phone.

1122
01:50:19,744 --> 01:50:21,995
安德頓家見
Meet me at Anderton 's.

1123
01:50:21,646 --> 01:50:25,274
從克羅的飯店房間找到的
We recovered that from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1124
01:50:30,354 --> 01:50:34,352
記得在巴爾的摩 我親手交給他這個
I remember when I gave this to him, back in Baltimore.

1125
01:50:35,292 --> 01:50:37,431
請坐，先生
Please, sir.

1126
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:41,780
你找到些什麼？
Tell me what you have.

1127
01:50:46,337 --> 01:50:50,245
這是安莉芙麗的謀殺案
This is the murder of a woman named Anne Lively.

1128
01:50:51,208 --> 01:50:55,647
約翰跟我說過 從看守所拿到的？
John told me about this. You got this from Containment?

1129
01:50:55,379 --> 01:50:58,898
對，是阿瑟和戴希爾的
Yes. This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiell.

1130
01:50:58,582 --> 01:51:01,389
亞嘉莎的失蹤了
Agatha's stream was missing.

1131
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:05,467
這份來自「虛擬實境」
This one is from the Cyber Parlor.

1132
01:51:05,156 --> 01:51:10,657
安德頓從亞嘉莎身上載下來 魯法斯萊理錄下來的
Anderton downloaded this directly from Agatha. Rufus Riley recorded it.

1133
01:51:12,830 --> 01:51:17,052
-同樣的預視影像 -不完全相同
It's the same prevision.  Not quite.

1134
01:51:18,302 --> 01:51:23,237
你看水面的風，注意漣漪
Look at the surface wind across the water. Watch the ripples.

1135
01:51:23,174 --> 01:51:26,517
從岸邊向外波動
Moving away from shore.

1136
01:51:27,278 --> 01:51:32,526
第二份取自看守所的影像 阿瑟和戴希看到的
Now the second image, the one from Containment that Art and Dash saw.

1137
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:34,858
注意看水
Watch the water.

1138
01:51:35,553 --> 01:51:40,985
風向變了 漣漪的波動方向相反
The wind's changed. The ripples are moving the other way.

1139
01:51:41,792 --> 01:51:45,761
兇案在不同的時間發生
This murder's taking place at two different times.

1140
01:51:45,496 --> 01:51:49,551
所長說 安德頓被通緝前看過這影像
Anderton was watching this right before he was tagged.

1141
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:52,747
他跟我說過失蹤的資料
He told me about the missing data stream.

1142
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:56,758
-他怕落到你手中 -對，我找到了
He was concerned you might find it.  He was right. I did.

1143
01:51:56,507 --> 01:51:58,683
影像一直在亞嘉莎體內
It was inside of Agatha.

1144
01:51:58,342 --> 01:52:03,799
為什麼有人想刪除檔案？
So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?

1145
01:52:03,581 --> 01:52:08,214
丹尼，直接告訴我你怎麼想
Danny, just tell me what you're thinking.

1146
01:52:08,018 --> 01:52:11,436
我認為有個兇手逍遙法外
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.

1147
01:52:11,622 --> 01:52:13,344
怎麼可能？
How?

1148
01:52:13,157 --> 01:52:18,127
傑德說先知會 重複看見同一兇案
Jad told me that sometimes the PreCogs see the same murder more than once.

1149
01:52:17,895 --> 01:52:22,200
-那稱為回音 -傑德稱之為前視印象
It's called an echo.  Jad called it PreCog deja vu.

1150
01:52:21,932 --> 01:52:25,967
我們要求技術人員將它剔除
We teach the techs to identify and disregard them.

1151
01:52:25,970 --> 01:52:31,692
沒錯，但是 如果技術人員誤認是回音呢？
Yeah, but what if a technician only thought he was looking at an echo?

1152
01:52:31,509 --> 01:52:36,638
假如是另一樁兇案呢？
What if he was looking at a completely different murder altogether?

1153
01:52:36,413 --> 01:52:38,560
我不懂
I don't understand.

1154
01:52:38,315 --> 01:52:41,119
兇手只要僱人去殺安莉芙麗
All you'd have to do is hire someone to kill Anne Lively...

1155
01:52:40,785 --> 01:52:44,900
例如有毒癮的流浪漢，一無所有
...like a drifter, a neuroin addict, someone with nothing to lose.

1156
01:52:44,622 --> 01:52:48,017
防罪中心一開始攔阻了兇案
Precrime stops the murder from taking place...

1157
01:52:47,691 --> 01:52:53,024
兇手戴了頭銬，入了獄 但緊跟著，另外有人…
...haloes the killer, takes him away. But then, right then, someone else...

1158
01:52:52,797 --> 01:52:57,312
看過影像，裝扮成兇手…
...having reviewed the prevision and dressed in the same clothes...

1159
01:52:57,034 --> 01:53:01,287
以同樣手法執行謀殺
...commits the murder in exactly the same way.

1160
01:53:01,005 --> 01:53:06,769
技術人員以為是回音，刪除掉
Technician takes a look, thinks he's looking at an echo, erases it.

1161
01:53:10,915 --> 01:53:16,135
一定是有權看影像的人
It'd have to be someone with access to the previsions in the first place.

1162
01:53:15,886 --> 01:53:18,499
某位高層人士
Someone fairly highup.

1163
01:53:20,157 --> 01:53:22,754
你聽見我聽到什麼嗎？
Do you know what I hear?

1164
01:53:23,894 --> 01:53:27,748
什麼也沒有 天花板沒腳步聲
Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs.

1165
01:53:27,498 --> 01:53:32,174
窗外沒飛行器 沒有蜘蛛的沙沙聲
No hovercraft out the window. No clicketyclick of little spyders.

1166
01:53:31,902 --> 01:53:33,916
為什麼聽不到？
Do you know why?

1167
01:53:33,571 --> 01:53:37,423
先知看不到任何東西
Because right now, the PreCogs can't see a thing.

1168
01:54:01,866 --> 01:54:05,705
看到沒？好美啊
Can you see? It's beautiful.

1169
01:54:05,669 --> 01:54:09,580
-我們要去哪裡？ -安全的地方
Where are we going?  Someplace safe.

1170
01:54:16,447 --> 01:54:18,943
-我是伯吉斯 -拉瑪，我是勞拉
Burgess.  Lamar, it's Lara.

1171
01:54:18,582 --> 01:54:21,631
-是的，勞拉 -請你一定要幫他
Yes, Lara.  You have to help him.

1172
01:54:22,286 --> 01:54:23,942
他在那裡嗎？
Is he there?

1173
01:54:25,689 --> 01:54:28,010
先知跟他在一起嗎？
Is the PreCog with him?

1174
01:54:31,495 --> 01:54:34,559
留住他們，我馬上過來
Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1175
01:54:34,231 --> 01:54:38,272
別告訴丹尼威妥，我信不過他
Please don't tell Danny Witwer. I don't trust him.

1176
01:54:39,169 --> 01:54:41,914
我絕口不提
I won't say a word.

1177
01:54:42,306 --> 01:54:46,602
不要讓約翰離開，好嗎？
You just don't let John leave, all right?

1178
01:54:47,778 --> 01:54:50,028
他不是兇手，拉瑪
He's no killer, Lamar.

1179
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:51,884
我知道
I know.

1180
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:05,093
好冷
It's cold.

1181
01:55:09,566 --> 01:55:13,040
勞拉，她是亞嘉莎
Lara, this is Agatha.

1182
01:55:17,708 --> 01:55:23,414
記得我為你和西恩 念「湯姆歷險記」嗎？
You remember when I would read Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?

1183
01:55:25,883 --> 01:55:31,669
湯姆和貝齊在山洞失蹤時 他好害怕
He got so scared when Tom and Becky were lost in the cave.

1184
01:55:33,757 --> 01:55:36,592
我想坐下來
I gotta sit down.

1185
01:55:36,894 --> 01:55:39,561
好好想清楚
I gotta figure this out.

1186
01:55:39,563 --> 01:55:42,310
一定得想出來
I gotta figure this out.

1187
01:56:21,305 --> 01:56:23,701
他們利用西恩
They used Sean.

1188
01:56:24,908 --> 01:56:28,251
讓我誤以為克羅殺了西恩
They wanted me to think Crow killed him.

1189
01:56:28,912 --> 01:56:31,016
但他沒有
But he didn't.

1190
01:56:32,016 --> 01:56:34,023
他沒有
He didn't.

1191
01:56:35,185 --> 01:56:38,274
他們為什麼要陷害你？
Why would they set you up?

1192
01:56:45,396 --> 01:56:48,769
因為我發現她的事
Because I found out about her.

1193
01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:51,526
誰的事？
About who?

1194
01:56:51,201 --> 01:56:55,449
-我以前怎麼沒發現？ -發現什麼？
How could I not have seen this?  Seen what?

1195
01:56:56,206 --> 01:56:58,814
安莉芙麗
Anne Lively.

1196
01:57:00,778 --> 01:57:02,842
亞嘉莎？
Agatha.

1197
01:57:07,017 --> 01:57:10,617
海曼博士說過「逝者未逝
Dr. Hineman once said, "The dead don't die...

1198
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,912
他們依舊守護我們」
...they look on and help. "

1199
01:57:13,157 --> 01:57:15,908
記得嗎，約翰？
Remember that, John.

1200
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:18,205
亞嘉莎
Agatha.

1201
01:57:17,795 --> 01:57:19,980
西恩
Sean.

1202
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:26,536
他正在沙灘上
He's on the beach now...

1203
01:57:26,670 --> 01:57:29,422
腳趾泡著海水

1204
01:57:29,973 --> 01:57:33,319
他要你一起陪他

1205
01:57:33,477 --> 01:57:37,343
他在沙灘上跟媽媽賽跑
He's been racing his mother up and down the sand.

1206
01:57:38,682 --> 01:57:42,035
這個家有好多愛
There's so much love in this house.

1207
01:57:46,557 --> 01:57:48,998
他已經十歲了

1208
01:57:50,894 --> 01:57:54,056
被一群動物圍繞著
He's surrounded by animals.

1209
01:57:54,798 --> 01:57:57,617
他想當獸醫
He wants to be a vet.

1210
01:57:58,936 --> 01:58:04,107
你們讓他養兔子、小鳥和狐貍
You keep a rabbit for him, a bird and a fox.

1211
01:58:05,175 --> 01:58:07,563
他念中學了
He's in high school.

1212
01:58:07,511 --> 01:58:10,858
他跟爸爸一樣愛跑步
He likes to run, like his father.

1213
01:58:10,848 --> 01:58:14,675
他參加兩里長跑和接力賽
He runs the twomile and the long relay.

1214
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:17,826
他23歲了
He's 23.

1215
01:58:18,722 --> 01:58:21,477
他在念大學
He's at a university.

1216
01:58:21,425 --> 01:58:25,108
他跟美麗的克蕾兒做愛

1217
01:58:24,795 --> 01:58:27,766
他向她求婚

1218
01:58:27,764 --> 01:58:31,973
他打電話告訴哭泣的勞拉
He calls here and tells Lara, who cries.

1219
01:58:33,003 --> 01:58:35,668
他繼續跑步
He still runs...

1220
01:58:35,239 --> 01:58:40,039
約翰看著他跑在校園和體育館
...across the university and in the stadium, where John watches.

1221
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:44,782
他跑得跟他爸爸一樣快
Oh, God. He's running so fast, just like his daddy.

1222
01:58:44,815 --> 01:58:49,593
他看見爸爸，他想跑向他
He sees his daddy. He wants to run to him.

1223
01:58:50,487 --> 01:58:55,625
但他只有六歲 他辦不到
But he's only 6 years old, and he can't do it.

1224
01:58:55,559 --> 01:58:58,554
而且那個人太快了
And the other man is so fast.

1225
01:59:01,765 --> 01:59:05,127
這個家有好多愛
There was so much love in this house.

1226
01:59:05,736 --> 01:59:08,731
我好想要他回來
I want him back so bad.

1227
01:59:10,641 --> 01:59:13,050
她也一樣
So did she.

1228
01:59:13,110 --> 01:59:15,472
你沒看到嗎？
Can't you see?

1229
01:59:18,649 --> 01:59:22,460
她希望她女兒回來
She just wanted her little girl back.

1230
01:59:24,021 --> 01:59:26,920
但來不及了
But it was too late.

1231
01:59:27,925 --> 01:59:31,081
她女兒走了
Her little girl was already gone.

1232
01:59:31,195 --> 01:59:33,454
她還活著
She's still alive.

1233
01:59:34,431 --> 01:59:36,946
她沒死
She didn't die.

1234
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:39,280
但她也不算活著
But she's not alive.

1235
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:42,634
亞嘉莎？
Agatha?

1236
01:59:44,608 --> 01:59:46,644
跟我說
Just tell me...

1237
01:59:46,577 --> 01:59:49,284
誰殺了你母親？
...who killed your mother?

1238
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:52,077
誰殺了安莉芙麗？
Who killed Anne Lively?

1239
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:58,510
對不起，約翰 你又得逃了
I'm sorry, John, but you're gonna have to run again.

1240
01:59:58,755 --> 02:00:01,585
-什麼？ -快逃！
What?  Run!

1241
02:00:17,808 --> 02:00:20,124
我愛你
I love you.

1242
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:23,749
-不會有事的 -跟他去，不會有事
It's okay.  You'll be fine with them.

1243
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:26,711
-不！不！ -跟著我
No! No!  Stay with me. Stay with me.

1244
02:00:26,216 --> 02:00:29,352
-約翰，不 -不要說話
John, no.  Don't talk.

1245
02:00:46,203 --> 02:00:48,210
約翰安德頓
John Anderton.

1246
02:00:48,805 --> 02:00:52,638
根據特區犯罪預防中心的授權
By mandate of the D.C. Precrime Division...

1247
02:00:52,175 --> 02:00:57,896
你因為謀害克羅和威妥被捕
...I'm placing you under arrest for the murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1248
02:01:00,550 --> 02:01:02,838
好了
That's it.

1249
02:01:02,586 --> 02:01:05,002
好乖
That's my girl.

1250
02:01:06,156 --> 02:01:09,108
我擔心死了
I was so worried about you.

1251
02:01:12,496 --> 02:01:14,969
他有傷害你嗎？
Did he hurt you?

1252
02:01:17,367 --> 02:01:19,647
我好想你
I missed you so much.

1253
02:01:19,136 --> 02:01:22,041
沒關繫了，有華利在
It's okay. Wally's here.

1254
02:01:22,105 --> 02:01:24,203
有華利在
Wally's here.

1255
02:01:28,679 --> 02:01:32,713
成了我的階下囚了，約翰
You're a part of my flock now, John.

1256
02:01:32,316 --> 02:01:34,501
歡迎
Welcome.

1257
02:01:34,785 --> 02:01:39,882
裡面其實挺舒服的 據說你會看到影像
It's actually kind of a rush. They say you have visions...

1258
02:01:39,489 --> 02:01:43,195
你的一輩子不停在眼前播放
...that your life flashes before your eyes...

1259
02:01:42,759 --> 02:01:46,809
你的夢想都會成真
...that all your dreams come true.

1260
02:01:54,305 --> 02:01:56,033
（約翰安德頓）

1261
02:02:02,946 --> 02:02:05,918
都是我的錯
This is all my fault.

1262
02:02:06,216 --> 02:02:09,493
誰也改變不了這個事實
There was nothing anyone could do.

1263
02:02:13,290 --> 02:02:16,701
我猜你想拿回他的東西吧
I thought you might want to have those.

1264
02:02:21,865 --> 02:02:27,493
多年沒穿，希望今晚能穿
I haven't worn this in years. I wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.

1265
02:02:27,137 --> 02:02:29,149
很好看
You look great.

1266
02:02:28,638 --> 02:02:33,450
我知道他有很多麻煩 但我卻未伸出援手
I knew he was having trouble for some time, yet I did nothing.

1267
02:02:33,043 --> 02:02:37,192
-「今日美國」記者來了 -現在不行
The guy from USA Today is here.  Tell him not now.

1268
02:02:36,747 --> 02:02:40,823
-他只想… -沒空！
He just wanted a few minutes before...  Not now!

1269
02:02:42,753 --> 02:02:46,910
-我以為你想退休了 -想過
I thought you were retiring.  Well, I was.

1270
02:02:46,523 --> 02:02:52,784
約翰的事讓我感到系統的脆弱
But this incident with John made me realize the fragility of all this.

1271
02:02:52,829 --> 02:02:56,762
這裡是約翰也是我的畢生結晶
This is John's legacy as much as it is my own.

1272
02:02:56,933 --> 02:03:01,012
我有義務保護它
Now I have an obligation to protect that.

1273
02:03:00,937 --> 02:03:05,095
我知道你難以接受
Lara, I know how difficult this is for you.

1274
02:03:04,674 --> 02:03:08,648
但，或許你可以放下心中的石頭
But maybe you can find some closure in the fact...

1275
02:03:08,178 --> 02:03:13,233
約翰終於找出殺你兒子的兇手
...that John finally found the man who killed your son.

1276
02:03:15,485 --> 02:03:17,533
誰是安莉芙麗？
Who's Anne Lively?

1277
02:03:19,656 --> 02:03:22,784
-誰？ -安莉芙麗
Who?  Anne Lively.

1278
02:03:22,592 --> 02:03:27,104
他被捕前正談到她
John was talking about her right before they took him.

1279
02:03:26,663 --> 02:03:29,511
我不知道她是誰
I don't know who that is.

1280
02:03:30,033 --> 02:03:35,768
他說他因為發現她所以被陷害
John said something about him being set up because he found out about her.

1281
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:40,908
-但我們知道約翰為什麼被通緝 -他還說克羅是個幌子
Well, we know why John was tagged.  He also said Crow was a fake.

1282
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:45,638
威妥呢？他在約翰家中 被約翰的槍所殺
And Witwer? He was killed with John's gun inside John's apartment.

1283
02:03:45,215 --> 02:03:50,032
知道約翰來此工作的原因嗎？
Do you know the reason why John came here to work for you?

1284
02:03:49,619 --> 02:03:51,691
-為了西恩？ -對
Sean.  Yes.

1285
02:03:51,788 --> 02:03:55,700
他到此工作，因為他以為
He came here to work for you because he thought...

1286
02:03:55,292 --> 02:04:00,443
防止類似的事情再發生
...if he could just stop that kind of thing from happening...

1287
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:04,380
-我瞭解 -不，你不瞭解
I understand.  No, I don't think you do.

1288
02:04:03,934 --> 02:04:09,239
先生，他們兩分鐘後 要舉行記者會
Sir, they wanna start the press conference in two minutes.

1289
02:04:08,839 --> 02:04:10,720
勞拉
Lara...

1290
02:04:10,507 --> 02:04:13,987
約翰是最頂尖的警察
...John was the best cop I ever knew...

1291
02:04:13,543 --> 02:04:17,033
某方面說，更是個好人
...and, in some ways, also the best man.

1292
02:04:16,546 --> 02:04:19,676
但每天帶著那份傷痛
But the scars he carried around...

1293
02:04:19,149 --> 02:04:25,105
他會希望我們記得他好的一面
Well, I know he'd want us to honor the good things we remember about him.

1294
02:04:24,721 --> 02:04:30,932
我也知道他為什麼跟你結婚 你跟他一樣固執
And I also know why he married you: You're as stubborn as he is.

1295
02:04:30,594 --> 02:04:35,531
-拉瑪 -你會打領帶吧？
Lamar...  Do you know how to tie one of these?

1296
02:04:35,131 --> 02:04:40,118
可以幫個忙嗎？我笨手笨腳
Could you please give me a hand? I'm all thumbs, as you see.

1297
02:04:47,377 --> 02:04:50,820
我會這麼辦
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1298
02:04:50,347 --> 02:04:55,222
到週一，我首先會調閱威妥的證物
First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

1299
02:04:54,818 --> 02:04:59,085
我會請吉狄恩查看守所檔案
And I'll have Gideon run the Containment files...

1300
02:04:58,655 --> 02:05:02,322
看有沒有溺斃女性叫…
...see if anyone drowned a woman by the name of...

1301
02:05:01,858 --> 02:05:05,293
你說她叫什麼名字？
What did you say her name was?

1302
02:05:06,730 --> 02:05:09,134
安莉芙麗
Anne Lively.

1303
02:05:09,065 --> 02:05:12,270
但我沒說過她是溺斃的
But I never said she drowned.

1304
02:05:31,488 --> 02:05:36,868
-先生，記者會開始了 -我馬上過去
Sir, the press conference is starting.  I'll be right there.

1305
02:05:40,964 --> 02:05:44,059
我們稍後再談
We'll talk about this later.

1306
02:05:44,167 --> 02:05:49,308
明天或許到小屋拜訪你
Perhaps tomorrow, I'll come by the cottage.

1307
02:06:25,508 --> 02:06:28,683
我想跟我先生說句話
I'd like a word with my husband.

1308
02:06:28,745 --> 02:06:32,417
你沒有授權
You're not authorized.

1309
02:06:31,982 --> 02:06:35,350
你怎麼進來的？
How did you get in here?

1310
02:06:43,393 --> 02:06:45,417
謝謝
Thank you.

1311
02:06:44,894 --> 02:06:50,759
各位女士先生，拉瑪伯吉斯 新成立的國家預測犯罪局長
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess, director of the new National Precrime.

1312
02:06:52,836 --> 02:06:57,325
我代表全體員工獻給您
On behalf of your staff, we present you with this.

1313
02:06:56,906 --> 02:07:01,331
-恭喜 -哇！
Congratulations, sir.  My God.

1314
02:07:01,845 --> 02:07:04,055
你們怎麼負擔得起？
How did you get this?

1315
02:07:03,513 --> 02:07:07,283
我扣了你六個月特支費
I padded your expense account for six months.

1316
02:07:09,085 --> 02:07:13,511
這款左輪槍 是由士兵獻給將軍們的
Revolvers like this one were given to generals...

1317
02:07:13,089 --> 02:07:16,874
以紀念南北戰爭結束
...at the end of the Civil War by their troops.

1318
02:07:16,426 --> 02:07:20,972
槍膛內裝填了 五發鍍金子彈
The cylinders were loaded with five goldplated bullets...

1319
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:24,460
五發鍍金子彈，象徵…
...to symbolize the end of the destruction and death...

1320
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,163
終結撕裂國家的破壞與死亡
...that had ripped the country apart for five years.

1321
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:30,793
防罪中心提升為國家機構後
Ladies and gentlemen, with Precrime going national...

1322
02:07:30,373 --> 02:07:34,983
或許可以期待一個時代的來臨
...maybe we can all look forward to a time when none of us...

1323
02:07:34,544 --> 02:07:38,516
再也毋需發射任何一顆子彈
...will have to discharge another firearm ever again.

1324
02:07:39,182 --> 02:07:44,507
開始盡情享用！ 這是命令！
Now enjoy yourselves. Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.

1325
02:07:46,823 --> 02:07:51,698
週末可以常造訪湖濱小屋了吧？
Does this mean we can finally use the lake house on weekends?

1326
02:07:53,863 --> 02:07:55,827
喂
Hello.

1327
02:07:55,331 --> 02:07:58,445
是的，馬上
Yes. Right away.

1328
02:07:58,068 --> 02:08:01,840
-對不起，很抱歉 -對不起
Excuse me, so sorry.  Excuse me.

1329
02:08:01,438 --> 02:08:03,497
-局長？ -是的
Sir?  Yes.

1330
02:08:02,972 --> 02:08:07,280
你私人專線上有急電
Sir, you have an emergency call on your private line.

1331
02:08:07,744 --> 02:08:10,157
伯吉斯
Yes, this is Burgess.

1332
02:08:09,612 --> 02:08:14,793
哈囉，拉瑪，恭喜 你成功了
Hello, Lamar. I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.

1333
02:08:14,384 --> 02:08:17,549
你創造了一個沒有兇殺案的世界
You created a world without murder.

1334
02:08:17,053 --> 02:08:20,858
大家想請你在帽子上簽名，可以嗎？
Everyone wants your name on a hat. Can you sign these?

1335
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:23,515
你只要踩著別人的屍體往前走
All you had to do was kill someone to do it.

1336
02:08:27,597 --> 02:08:29,371
分析室，傑德
Aroom. Jad.

1337
02:08:29,632 --> 02:08:33,615
傑德，是勞拉，約翰請你幫個忙
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

1338
02:08:33,169 --> 02:08:38,360
-什麼意思？ -亞嘉莎的母親，安莉芙麗
What are you talking about?  Agatha 's mother, Anne Lively.

1339
02:08:37,907 --> 02:08:42,875
一位放棄孩子的死毒鬼
Just a junkie who had a kid once and had to give her up, but surprise!

1340
02:08:42,412 --> 02:08:46,060
沒想到她戒了毒 想接女兒回家
She cleaned herself up, and she wanted her daughter back.

1341
02:08:45,548 --> 02:08:48,228
她想要回亞嘉莎
She wanted Agatha.

1342
02:08:49,986 --> 02:08:55,051
傑德，你看，只有亞嘉莎的影像 沒有時間也沒有附屬數據
Jad, you getting this? It's from the female only. No time or incident data.

1343
02:08:54,591 --> 02:08:57,759
這不是未來，已經發生過了
It isn't the future. It already happened.

1344
02:08:57,227 --> 02:09:01,628
問題是，沒有亞嘉莎 就沒有防罪中心
And the problem was, without Agatha, there was no Precrime.

1345
02:09:01,131 --> 02:09:06,548
她一直是三位中最強的一位 沒有亞嘉莎一切將化為烏有
She's the strongest of the three. Without Agatha, you had nothing.

1346
02:09:06,102 --> 02:09:12,111
沒有她，你怎麼可能 站在那裡為大家簽名
You wouldn't be where you are now, standing there, signing autographs.

1347
02:09:19,382 --> 02:09:23,455
-傑德，你在幹嘛？ -你在幹嘛？
What are you doing?  What are you doing with that?

1348
02:09:22,952 --> 02:09:27,202
-你想幹嘛，大個子？ -傳送前先想清楚
What you up to, big man?  Think before you send that.

1349
02:09:26,756 --> 02:09:28,516
慢一點
Slow down.

1350
02:09:48,344 --> 02:09:53,684
所以你不得不除掉安莉芙麗 真是項大工程
Now you had to get rid of Anne Lively, which presented a problem:

1351
02:09:53,183 --> 02:09:57,564
你怎麼殺她又不被先知看見？
How can you kill her without the PreCogs seeing it?

1352
02:09:57,086 --> 02:10:01,961
很簡單，利用你控制的系統
Simple. Use a system you control against her.

1353
02:10:01,524 --> 02:10:07,345
你雇殺手殺她 你知道先知會看見
You hired someone to kill her, knowing the PreCogs would see that murder.

1354
02:10:06,896 --> 02:10:11,125
你引誘安莉芙麗到湖邊
You lured Anne Lively out to the lake...

1355
02:10:10,633 --> 02:10:15,277
承諾讓她母女團圓
...with the promise of reuniting her with her daughter.

1356
02:10:59,115 --> 02:11:01,867
我女兒呢？
Where's my daughter?

1357
02:11:08,391 --> 02:11:10,366
哪裡？
Where?

1358
02:11:11,661 --> 02:11:13,699
看！
Run!

1359
02:11:16,399 --> 02:11:18,252
快逃！
Run!

1360
02:11:29,078 --> 02:11:33,136
四下無人時，你親手殺了她
When you were all alone, you killed her yourself...

1361
02:11:32,615 --> 02:11:37,239
使用與兇手同樣的手法
...in the same way the PreCogs predicted your John Doe would kill her.

1362
02:11:36,753 --> 02:11:40,369
讓實際謀殺看起來像回音
You made the real murder look like an echo...

1363
02:11:39,822 --> 02:11:45,215
而技術人員做了他們該做的： 不理會它
...knowing the tech would do what he was trained to do: Disregard it.

1364
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:55,446
安莉芙麗變成另一個失蹤人口
Anne Lively became just another missing person.

1365
02:11:55,471 --> 02:11:59,296
你現在怎麼辦，拉瑪？
So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?

1366
02:11:59,375 --> 02:12:02,016
你要怎麼辦？
What are you gonna do?

1367
02:12:12,422 --> 02:12:14,511
紅球狀況！
We got a Red Ball!

1368
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:19,651
（被害人 約翰安德頓）

1369
02:12:19,929 --> 02:12:23,540
想想小女孩救過的生命
Think about the lives that little girl has saved.

1370
02:12:22,999 --> 02:12:26,586
想想小女孩救過的生命
Think about the lives that little girl has saved.

1371
02:12:26,069 --> 02:12:31,271
想想其它可以被拯救的生命
那小女孩可以救西恩
Think of all the lives she will save. She could have saved Sean.

1372
02:12:30,807 --> 02:12:34,105
不准你說他的名字！
Don't you ever say his name!

1373
02:12:35,611 --> 02:12:39,463
你利用我對亡兒的思念陷害我
You used the memory of my dead son to set me up.

1374
02:12:38,948 --> 02:12:42,639
你利用我對亡兒的思念陷害我
You used the memory of my dead son to set me up.

1375
02:12:42,085 --> 02:12:45,809
你知道我會為他殺人
You knew that would drive me to murder.

1376
02:12:45,288 --> 02:12:49,379
-你現在怎麼辦，拉瑪？ -你現在怎麼辦，拉瑪？
What are you gonna do now, Lamar?  What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

1377
02:12:48,858 --> 02:12:51,606
-你要怎麼 -封住我的嘴？
How are you gonna...?  Shut me up?

1378
02:12:51,027 --> 02:12:54,095
原諒我，約翰
Forgive me, John.

1379
02:13:01,704 --> 02:13:04,253
原諒我，約翰
Forgive me, John.

1380
02:13:08,411 --> 02:13:10,971
（兇手 拉瑪伯吉斯）

1381
02:13:15,084 --> 02:13:17,202
拉瑪
Lamar.

1382
02:13:16,853 --> 02:13:19,034
結束了
It's over.

1383
02:13:18,955 --> 02:13:24,839
剩下的唯一問題是，你怎麼收場？
The question you have to ask is, what are you gonna do now?

1384
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:41,157
毫無懷疑，先知已看見此事
No doubt the PreCogs have already seen this.

1385
02:13:40,643 --> 02:13:43,049
沒錯
No doubt.

1386
02:13:43,312 --> 02:13:46,358
你瞭解兩難之處了吧？
You see the dilemma, don't you?

1387
02:13:46,315 --> 02:13:51,361
不殺我，表示先知錯了 犯罪防治中心跟著完蛋
If you don't kill me, PreCogs were wrong and Precrime is over.

1388
02:13:51,754 --> 02:13:55,985
殺我，你前途就毀了
If you do kill me, you go away...

1389
02:13:55,792 --> 02:14:00,912
但證明系統有效，先知正確
...but it proves the system works. PreCogs were right.

1390
02:14:06,402 --> 02:14:10,424
所以，你該怎麼辦？
So, what are you gonna do now?

1391
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,776
代價是什麼？
What's it worth?

1392
02:14:13,876 --> 02:14:16,891
只不過是另一樁謀殺
Just one more murder.

1393
02:14:19,015 --> 02:14:24,742
你戴著頭銬在地獄腐爛 但民眾還是相信防罪中心
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but people will still believe in Precrime.

1394
02:14:24,287 --> 02:14:28,999
你只需殺了我，就像先知預測的
All you have to do is kill me, like they said you would.

1395
02:14:31,694 --> 02:14:34,022
除非
Except...

1396
02:14:34,130 --> 02:14:37,323
你知道自己的未來
...you know your own future...

1397
02:14:36,799 --> 02:14:41,113
也就是你能任意改變未來
...which means you can change it if you want to.

1398
02:14:41,504 --> 02:14:45,224
你還有選擇，拉瑪
You still have a choice, Lamar.

1399
02:14:44,974 --> 02:14:47,608
跟我一樣
Like I did.

1400
02:14:51,514 --> 02:14:54,996
沒錯，我還有選擇
Yes, I have a choice...

1401
02:14:55,585 --> 02:14:58,322
而且已經選好了
...and I made it.

1402
02:14:58,488 --> 02:15:01,242
原諒我，約翰
Forgive me, John.

1403
02:15:02,091 --> 02:15:04,629
原諒我
Forgive me.

1404
02:15:09,132 --> 02:15:11,598
原諒我，孩子
Forgive me, my boy.

1405
02:15:29,485 --> 02:15:31,832
拉瑪！
Lamar!

1406
02:15:42,298 --> 02:15:47,716
2054年，實驗六年之後 預測犯罪計劃終遭放棄
In 2054, the sixyear Precrime experiment was abandoned.

1407
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:58,699
所有囚犯無條件無罪釋放
All prisoners were unconditionally pardoned and released...

1408
02:15:58,147 --> 02:16:03,130
雖然幾位仍被警方追蹤數年
...although police departments kept watch on many of them for years.

1409
02:16:50,233 --> 02:16:53,344
亞嘉莎與雙胞胎
Agatha and the twins...

1410
02:16:52,768 --> 02:16:56,848
被移至一隱密場所
...were transferred to an undisclosed location...

1411
02:16:57,006 --> 02:17:01,260
一個他們能發揮天賦的地方
...a place where they could find relief from their gifts...

1412
02:17:00,843 --> 02:17:05,540
得以平靜的安度餘生
...a place where they could live out their lives in peace.

1413
02:18:33,469 --> 02:18:37,235
謝謝觀賞

1414
02:21:59,742 --> 02:22:04,873
紀念麥克馬西亞
