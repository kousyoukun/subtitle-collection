1
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:35,970
You know how blind I am without them.

2
00:01:36,236 --> 00:01:38,116
Howard, don't cry.

3
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,059
Murder.

4
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:37,080
- Good luck, John.
- Any contractions?

5
00:02:37,342 --> 00:02:39,022
Only the ones you give me.

6
00:02:53,942 --> 00:02:56,622
- What's coming?
- Red Ball, double homicide.

7
00:02:56,904 --> 00:02:59,984
One male, one female.
Killer's male, white, 40s.

8
00:03:00,282 --> 00:03:04,922
Agatha nailed the time at 8:04 a.m.
The twins are a little fuzzy on that.

9
00:03:05,288 --> 00:03:08,728
Location's still uncertain.
Remote witnesses are plugged in.

10
00:03:09,041 --> 00:03:11,681
This will be case number 1108.

11
00:03:16,048 --> 00:03:17,888
Morning, detectives.

12
00:03:19,135 --> 00:03:22,215
Case number 1108,
previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...

13
00:03:22,514 --> 00:03:24,354
...recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's Q-stacks.

14
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,999
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

15
00:03:29,355 --> 00:03:30,355
Good morning.

16
00:03:30,564 --> 00:03:34,044
Will the witness preview and validate
1108 at this time?

17
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:36,240
Affirmative. I will validate.

18
00:03:36,487 --> 00:03:37,887
Go get them.

19
00:03:38,197 --> 00:03:40,877
- Standby.
- Time of murder: 8:04 a.m.

20
00:03:41,158 --> 00:03:45,358
That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds
from now. This is a Red Ball.

21
00:04:11,274 --> 00:04:13,554
You know how blind I am without them.

22
00:04:15,444 --> 00:04:18,084
All right, Howard Marks,
where are you?

23
00:04:19,032 --> 00:04:22,552
Howard? Howard, breakfast.

24
00:04:38,385 --> 00:04:40,545
Four score and seven years ago...

25
00:04:40,971 --> 00:04:43,971
- He looked familiar.
- Who?

26
00:04:44,267 --> 00:04:47,187
A man standing in the park
across the street.

27
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:49,678
- Seen him before.
- How can you tell?

28
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:52,779
You're blind without your glasses.
Where are your glasses?

29
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,787
- In the bedroom.
- You're running out of time.

30
00:04:56,154 --> 00:04:57,954
- You know how blind I am...

31
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:16,077
I show eight Howard Markses in the
District. Sorting by race and age.

32
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:21,065
Run their license and registration.
See if I can capture an address here.

33
00:05:23,266 --> 00:05:25,546
I was thinking I'd stay home today.

34
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:28,649
- What about your meeting?
- I've been working too much.

35
00:05:28,938 --> 00:05:31,738
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.

36
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:37,219
- Six licenses. Where do you want them?
- Over here, please.

37
00:05:58,093 --> 00:06:01,053
You know how blind I am without them.

38
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:08,393
Got him in the Foxhall.
4421 Gainsborough.

39
00:06:08,729 --> 00:06:11,809
Send DCPD. Set up a perimeter.
Tell them we're en route.

40
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:15,828
I was thinking maybe I'd play hooky,
stay home today.

41
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:20,128
- "We've come to dedicate a portion..."
- What do you think?

42
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,491
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.

43
00:06:23,787 --> 00:06:26,187
I've been working too much anyway.

44
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,331
- "But in a larger s..." Good.
- We could have lunch together.

45
00:06:30,627 --> 00:06:32,907
- What do you say?
- "We cannot consecrate...

46
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:36,053
- I would love to.
- "The brave men, living and dead...

47
00:06:36,342 --> 00:06:39,022
I have an open house
at the Ressler place.

48
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:43,543
- Have consecrated, far above our
poor power to add or detract. "

49
00:06:44,017 --> 00:06:46,537
I guess that's why you look so nice.

50
00:06:48,312 --> 00:06:52,352
Chief! We got a problem
with our location.

51
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:58,618
- It's no longer there.
- Shit!

52
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,785
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.

53
00:07:01,035 --> 00:07:02,955
Investigator from the fed's here.

54
00:07:03,203 --> 00:07:05,563
I don't need some twink
from the fed poking around.

55
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:07,311
I wrote it on your calendar.

56
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:09,861
See if the neighbors knew
where they went.

57
00:07:10,128 --> 00:07:11,968
- Check all relations.
- Checking.

58
00:07:12,212 --> 00:07:16,372
Just get him some coffee,
tell him how I save your ass every day.

59
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:18,161
I got coffee, thanks.

60
00:07:18,386 --> 00:07:20,946
Danny Witwer,
the twink from the fed.

61
00:07:21,222 --> 00:07:22,982
Oops. Gum?

62
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:25,624
I'll give you the full tour
some other time.

63
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:29,694
They moved two weeks ago. Nobody
knows where. Still searching for family.

64
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:31,663
Time horizon, 12 minutes.

65
00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,984
He's scrubbing the image, looking for...

66
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,433
...clues as to where
the murder will happen.

67
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:41,656
Original running bond brick pattern,
Georgian details. Brick was repointed.

68
00:07:42,912 --> 00:07:47,632
And that this nation, under God,
shall not perish from the earth.

69
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,604
Victims are pronounced here,
killers here.

70
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,159
Beyond that, all we have to run on
are the images that they produce.

71
00:08:05,602 --> 00:08:08,322
- Show a cop on horseback.
- Near the Capitol?

72
00:08:08,605 --> 00:08:11,165
- No Maglev system.
- The Mall?

73
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,392
Georgetown.

74
00:08:13,652 --> 00:08:16,692
The Pre-Cogs can see a murder
four days out. Why the late call?

75
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:21,268
A Red Ball. Crimes of passion have no
premeditation, so they show up late.

76
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:25,979
Most of our scrambles are flash events.
We rarely see premeditation anymore.

77
00:08:26,332 --> 00:08:28,092
People have gotten the message.

78
00:08:28,334 --> 00:08:32,574
I show a match with Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.

79
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:37,162
- He did two dozen houses in D.C.
- Time horizon, 10 minutes.

80
00:08:42,682 --> 00:08:44,282
Look at this kid.

81
00:08:44,893 --> 00:08:47,453
In this one,
he's on the left side of the man.

82
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:49,250
Yes. So?

83
00:08:49,481 --> 00:08:51,241
This one he's on the right.

84
00:09:08,418 --> 00:09:10,258
Merry-go-round.

85
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:12,199
It's a park.

86
00:09:15,884 --> 00:09:19,164
There's only 16 of these old
merry-go-rounds left in the city.

87
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:22,071
Two in Georgetown, one in
Barnaby Woods, the others in Woodley.

88
00:09:22,349 --> 00:09:24,869
It's gotta be Barnaby Woods.
Evanna, flight time?

89
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,624
The way I drive?
Three minutes after wheels up.

90
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:42,602
- Clear.
- Clear.

91
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:05,444
Time horizon, six minutes.

92
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,599
Let's go to bed.

93
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,856
Let's do it in here.

94
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,430
- But the bed is soft.
- I'm soft.

95
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:37,933
Shit.

96
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:40,977
Which one is it?

97
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,307
- Not the bed.
- Come on.

98
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,787
I don't want to be on the bed.

99
00:11:56,301 --> 00:12:00,381
- We're catching up to the future.
- Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

100
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:03,217
- Jad?
- Go ahead.

101
00:12:03,476 --> 00:12:06,156
- Did he close the front door?
- What?

102
00:12:06,437 --> 00:12:08,797
Did Marks close the front door?

103
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,350
Front door...

104
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,439
I didn't wanna be on the bed.

105
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,239
- Negative. The front door is open.
- Time horizon, 30 seconds.

106
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,330
I forgot my glasses.

107
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:44,682
Howard.

108
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,693
You know how blind I am without them.

109
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:02,004
Howard, don't cry.

110
00:13:02,454 --> 00:13:03,494
Marks!

111
00:13:22,642 --> 00:13:24,402
Look at me. Look at me.

112
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,479
Positive for Howard Marks.

113
00:13:31,735 --> 00:13:34,855
By mandate of the District of Columbia
Precrime Division...

114
00:13:35,155 --> 00:13:39,195
...you're under arrest for the future
murder of Mrs. Marks and Mr. Dubin...

115
00:13:39,535 --> 00:13:42,895
...that was to take place today
at 0800 hours and four minutes.

116
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:46,965
- I didn't do anything. Sarah?
- Give the man his hat.

117
00:13:47,293 --> 00:13:51,453
Oh, God.
Don't put that halo on me. Sarah!

118
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:56,197
- Put your hand on your head.
- Help me! I wasn't gonna do anything!

119
00:13:56,553 --> 00:13:59,193
I'm Officer Scott with the
Precrime Trauma Response Unit.

120
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,712
Sit here a minute and listen to me.

121
00:14:01,975 --> 00:14:04,735
Your husband is being arrested
by Precrime.

122
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,740
Oh, God, Howard, no.

123
00:14:08,190 --> 00:14:12,350
Howard, don't cry.
Howard, don't cry.

124
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:20,080
Please, don't cry.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

125
00:14:22,454 --> 00:14:24,854
I thought they stopped the murder.

126
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,376
That's just an echo.
Pre-Cog deja vu, if you will.

127
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,873
The really bad ones
the Pre-Cogs see over and over again.

128
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:35,334
Wally, erase the incoming.

129
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:53,117
Imagine a world without murder.

130
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:56,115
- I lost my best friend.
- I lost my aunt.

131
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:58,407
- I lost my dad.
- I lost my wife.

132
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:03,183
Just six years ago, the homicide rate
had reached epidemic proportions.

133
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:06,546
It seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed.

134
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:10,916
But instead of one miracle, we
were given three: The Pre-Cognitives.

135
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:13,977
Within just one month
under the Precrime program...

136
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,741
...the murder rate in the District
of Columbia was reduced 90%% .

137
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,137
- They were waiting for me.
- He was gonna rape me.

138
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:22,192
- I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.

139
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:26,794
Within a year, Precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nation 's capital.

140
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,270
In the six years of our experiment...

141
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:32,975
...there hasn't been a single murder.

142
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:35,357
And now Precrime can work for you.

143
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:38,458
We want to make certain
that every American...

144
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:41,745
...can bank on the infallibility
of the system.

145
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:47,365
And to ensure that what keeps us safe
will also keep us free.

146
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,881
- Precrime. It works.
- It works.

147
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:52,492
- It works.
- It works.

148
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,316
- It works.
- It works.

149
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:57,248
Precrime. It works.

150
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:02,356
On Tuesday, April 22, vote "yes"
on the National Precrime Initiative.

151
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:08,846
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

152
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,997
- Just need a little clarity.
- True that.

153
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:22,258
You want the customary clarity or
the new and improved kind of clarity?

154
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,278
Give me the new stuff.

155
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:29,956
New and improved clarity.
Clarity, clarity. Yes, indeed.

156
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:32,034
Come on. Come on.

157
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,539
Don't bust my balls. You've only given
me four, and some of these are duds.

158
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:37,616
Sweet dreams, chief.

159
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:43,082
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

160
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,672
I could use a little juice on my side.

161
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,139
What do you think you know?

162
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,039
It's like my daddy used to say:

163
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:54,739
"In the land of the blind...

164
00:16:55,949 --> 00:17:00,149
...the one-eyed man is king. "

165
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,795
I'm home.

166
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:32,402
Overhead.

167
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:30,213
Wall screen.

168
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:39,211
- Sean.
- Hi, Daddy.

169
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,049
Can you teach me how to run faster?

170
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:47,150
Because all the kids in my class
run faster than me.

171
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:48,854
That's good.

172
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:51,269
Keep your knees up.

173
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:55,032
Like that. Like that.
High. High. Like that.

174
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:58,859
- See, you're a natural runner.
- Gotta keep running.

175
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:01,962
Yeah. Gotta keep running.

176
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,352
Gotta keep running.

177
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:09,536
- Will I be as fast as you someday?
- Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.

178
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:13,489
- You're gonna beat everybody.
- I think you'll beat everyone someday.

179
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:16,962
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.

180
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:19,943
- You gotta give me a kiss.
- Not on the lips.

181
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:23,722
Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.

182
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,460
Yeah, all right. All right.

183
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:27,426
I love you.

184
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:31,265
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Daddy.

185
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,723
Reminds me of Rosarito Beach.

186
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:11,726
Remember?

187
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,140
We had 20 dollars and...

188
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:19,985
Waiting in that van so the sun
would shine on our vacation.

189
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:26,418
John. John. John,
put the camera down.

190
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:31,713
Look, I'm all ready for bed.
What is this? No. Put it away.

191
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:34,452
It's time to put the camera
to sleep...

192
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,920
...and time to come
and take care of your wife.

193
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:45,917
Why don 't you put the camera down
and come and watch the rain with me?

194
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:50,248
No? I promise I'll make it
a memorable moment.

195
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:57,808
Put the camera down
or you're not getting anything tonight.

196
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:42,818
A gentleman at Justice
wants to take this away from us.

197
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:45,804
In a week, people will vote
on whether or not...

198
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:49,286
...what we've been doing has been
a noble-minded enterprise...

199
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:52,829
...or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime.

200
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:54,458
John...

201
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:59,296
...watch this Danny Witwer,
the observer from Justice.

202
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:02,442
- I met him yesterday.
- Let him look around.

203
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:04,928
Answer his questions,
but watch him.

204
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,909
If there's any problem,
make sure we know about it.

205
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:12,378
When the Pre-Cogs declare a killer,
their name is embedded in the wood.

206
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:17,177
Since the shape and grain of each piece
is unique, they're impossible to forge.

207
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:21,135
You understand the legalistic
drawback to Precrime methodology.

208
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:24,096
- Here we go again.
- I'm not with the ACLU on this...

209
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,936
...but we arrest individuals
who've broken no law.

210
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,772
- They will.
- The commission is metaphysics.

211
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,688
The Pre-Cogs see the future,
and they're never wrong.

212
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,688
But it's not the future if you stop it.

213
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:38,249
- Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
- Yes.

214
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:42,357
You're talking about predetermination,
which happens all the time.

215
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,840
- Why'd you catch that?
- It was gonna fall.

216
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,309
You're certain?

217
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,889
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

218
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:56,774
Preventing it doesn't change
the fact that it was going to happen.

219
00:22:57,077 --> 00:22:59,397
You ever get any false positives?

220
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:04,503
Someone intends to kill, but doesn't.
How do the Pre-Cogs tell the difference?

221
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:08,596
They don't see what you intend to do,
only what you will do.

222
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,763
Why can't they see
rapes, assaults, suicides?

223
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:14,011
Because of the nature of murder.

224
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,501
Nothing's more destructive to the
metaphysical fabric that binds us...

225
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:21,687
...than the untimely murder of a human.
- That wasn't Walt Whitman.

226
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,580
Iris Hineman. She developed Pre-Cogs,
designed the system and the interface.

227
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:29,741
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.

228
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:33,308
- To Hineman?
- To them.

229
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:38,394
- Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
- You've never been inside?

230
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:42,025
We keep strict separation so that
no one can be accused of tampering.

231
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:46,413
- I'll be the first one to go in then?
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

232
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:50,476
- If it's a question of authority...
- There is no question.

233
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,559
You don't have any.

234
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,010
I have a warrant in my pocket
that says different.

235
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:10,612
- Show it to me.
- Sure.

236
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:18,629
This investigation of Precrime
and its personnel is conducted...

237
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:23,352
...under the direct supervision and
permission from the attorney general.

238
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,917
I'm here as his representative...

239
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,090
...which means you're now operating
under my supervision.

240
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:37,837
Seems you've been left
out of the loop.

241
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:50,486
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

242
00:24:56,535 --> 00:25:00,455
- Hold it right there. Hold on.
- Not cleared for access.

243
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,401
Eye-dent: John Anderton. Approved.

244
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,683
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.

245
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:17,128
Danny Witwer from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

246
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,952
- I can't touch you.
- Don't touch anything.

247
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:23,386
- You can't be in here.
- Just answer his questions.

248
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,169
- Tell me how...
- They're sleeping.

249
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,282
Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

250
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,331
The photon milk acts as both a
nutrient supply and conductor.

251
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:37,736
It enhances the images they receive.
We call the female Agatha.

252
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,878
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.
We scan by way of optical tomography.

253
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,011
White-light pinpoints pulse
along the length of the headgear...

254
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,295
...and are reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

255
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,977
In other words, we see what they see.

256
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:57,912
They don't feel pain. We keep
their heads stocked with dopamine.

257
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:01,585
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

258
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,783
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

259
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:09,545
- They can't be kept too awake either.
- Don't think of them as human.

260
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,449
No. They're much more than that.

261
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,830
Science has stolen
most of our miracles.

262
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:24,627
In a way, they give us hope,
hope of the existence of the divine.

263
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:28,642
It's interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Pre-Cogs.

264
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:31,125
Pre-Cogs are pattern-recognition filters.
That's all.

265
00:26:31,385 --> 00:26:34,345
- Yet you call this room the "temple. "
- A nickname.

266
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:36,718
The oracle isn't where
the power is, anyway.

267
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:41,454
The power is with the priests,
even if they had to invent the oracle.

268
00:26:43,147 --> 00:26:46,027
You guys are nodding like you know
what he's talking about.

269
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:50,607
Well, come on, chief. The way we work,
changing destiny and all...

270
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,946
...we're more like clergy than cops.

271
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,759
- Jad.
- Yeah?

272
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:58,441
Go to work. All of you.

273
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:08,751
Sorry. Old habit.

274
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:12,527
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary
before I became a cop.

275
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:15,965
- My father was proud.
- What does he think of your work?

276
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:20,785
I don't know. He was shot and killed
when I was 15 at our church in Dublin.

277
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:23,945
I know what it's like
to lose someone close.

278
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:26,391
Nothing's like the loss of a child.

279
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:30,731
I don't have any children, so I can
only imagine what that was like.

280
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:34,592
To lose your son
in such a public place like that...

281
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:37,989
Now we can make sure that
kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone.

282
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:41,888
- Tell me what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.

283
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,975
There hasn't been a murder
in six years. This system is...

284
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:49,694
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.

285
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:52,302
It always is.

286
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,100
John.

287
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:38,847
Wally.

288
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:48,614
Can you see?

289
00:29:20,812 --> 00:29:24,292
What happened? Her ACTH levels
just shot through the roof!

290
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:26,487
- What'd you do?
- She grabbed me.

291
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:30,415
Impossible. They're not aware of us.
In the milk, all they see is the future.

292
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:34,619
- She looked straight at me.
- It could have been a nightmare.

293
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:38,071
- She spoke to me.
- To you?

294
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:40,132
What'd she say?

295
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:42,773
"Can you see?"

296
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:04,209
You the sentry?

297
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:07,664
Yes, sir, I'm Gideon.

298
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:09,944
You're Chief Anderton.

299
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:13,341
The music relaxes the prisoners.

300
00:30:13,617 --> 00:30:16,977
I don't ever see you Precops down here.
Am I in trouble?

301
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:20,373
Not yet.
I'm interested in a murder.

302
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:24,107
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?
- Drowning.

303
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,220
That narrows it down.
Not too many in here for that.

304
00:30:27,507 --> 00:30:30,827
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

305
00:30:31,135 --> 00:30:35,415
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour
they got tomorrow. You like this tie?

306
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:36,766
Stop.

307
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,840
Roll back.

308
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:44,639
There.

309
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:50,459
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

310
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:54,993
- This is the composite of the three?
- That's right.

311
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:58,247
Combined data stream
based on all three previsions.

312
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:01,779
- Just show me Agatha's data stream.
- For that...

313
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:05,681
...we go for a ride.

314
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,286
My God.

315
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,735
I'd forgotten there were so many.

316
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:36,711
And to think they'd all be out there
killing people if it wasn't for you.

317
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:40,171
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they seem.

318
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:44,218
But on the inside: Busy, busy, busy.

319
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:48,905
Okey-pokey.
Now that is one bad man.

320
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:52,661
He drowned a woman named
Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

321
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:56,651
The killer's a John Doe,
never identified.

322
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,240
Why is he still a John Doe?
Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan?

323
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:21,139
Those are not his eyes. He had them
swapped out to fool the scanners.

324
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:25,341
You can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days.

325
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:29,352
Okay, so you want
just the female prevision.

326
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:31,237
That's right.

327
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:40,553
We don't seem to have her data.

328
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:43,078
Try again.

329
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:48,047
This is odd. See?

330
00:32:48,362 --> 00:32:53,042
We have the two previsions. We got
what Art saw. We got what Dash saw.

331
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,330
But Agatha's isn't here.

332
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,270
Probably just a glitch.

333
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,660
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

334
00:33:05,213 --> 00:33:09,053
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here.

335
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:12,225
Address history
includes the Beaton Clinic.

336
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:15,592
So she cleaned up.
Where is she now?

337
00:33:17,393 --> 00:33:20,113
I guess glitches come in twos.

338
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:26,445
You finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another.

339
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:32,825
No.

340
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:37,164
Can't let you take that out of here,
chief.

341
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:41,721
- It's against the rules.
- Anything else against the rules?

342
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:53,341
Careful, chief. You dig up the past,
all you get is dirty.

343
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,709
The third prevision was what,
kind of fuzzy or something?

344
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:06,104
No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

345
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:11,406
That's not all. There are a dozen more
cases with missing previsions.

346
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,903
You'd think we'd have found
the cure for the common cold.

347
00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:17,445
- It's stress.
- What's this?

348
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:19,627
Herbal tea with honey.

349
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:23,277
I hate herbal tea.
Almost as much as I hate honey.

350
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:26,349
Just drink it,
before I pour it in your lap.

351
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:29,392
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you.

352
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:33,326
Witwer's scheduled for a tour
of Containment tomorrow.

353
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,561
Yeah, give him a tour.

354
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:39,418
- Lara called me.
- What?

355
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:43,347
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am I.

356
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:45,514
I'm fine.

357
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:49,497
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time in the Sprawl.

358
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:53,871
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night.

359
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:57,621
What if Danny Witwer
insisted on a full chem run?

360
00:34:57,956 --> 00:34:59,556
I'm fine.

361
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:05,406
The minute Precrime goes national,
they are going to take it away.

362
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:08,038
- We won't let them.
- No?

363
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:12,462
How is an old man and a cop on the
whiff ever going to stop them?

364
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,548
My father once said to me...

365
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,850
..."You don't choose the things
you believe in. They choose you. "

366
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:22,028
There's a reason you are here.

367
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:27,835
Had Precrime been in place earlier,
your loss would have been prevented.

368
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,760
Remember, the eyes...

369
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,439
The eyes of the nation
are on us right now.

370
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:38,993
I'm not the generation
anyone listens to...

371
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:43,333
...but people trust you when you
speak of your belief in Precrime.

372
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:48,368
They know that it's a belief born of
pain, not politics. I understood that.

373
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:52,158
I may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

374
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,730
But now,
your pain is hurting both of us.

375
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:04,459
They're not going to take it
away from us.

376
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:07,169
I won't let them.

377
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:39,254
Bingo.

378
00:36:52,493 --> 00:36:54,253
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, buddy.

379
00:36:54,537 --> 00:36:56,377
- I made up a club.
- Yeah?

380
00:36:56,664 --> 00:37:00,144
- We're called the Crescos.
- The Crescos.

381
00:37:00,501 --> 00:37:02,901
- We made up a soccer team.
- Yeah?

382
00:37:03,213 --> 00:37:05,813
- We practice at school.
- With Connor?

383
00:37:06,133 --> 00:37:09,053
Your daddy's in a lot of trouble,
Sean.

384
00:37:34,203 --> 00:37:36,563
- Wait!
- No!

385
00:37:39,334 --> 00:37:41,934
Jad, how come you're not with
Father Witwer?

386
00:37:42,253 --> 00:37:47,773
We're in motion on something. We got a
white, male victim, about 5' 10", 170.

387
00:37:48,176 --> 00:37:50,656
He takes a round in the 10-ring
and goes out a window.

388
00:37:50,971 --> 00:37:52,691
- Red Ball?
- Nope. Brown Ball.

389
00:37:52,973 --> 00:37:54,133
It's premeditated.

390
00:37:54,391 --> 00:37:57,871
Amazing. There's someone within
200 miles still dumb enough to do that.

391
00:37:58,187 --> 00:37:59,667
The victim's name is Leo Crow.

392
00:37:59,939 --> 00:38:04,299
This is case number 1109. Time of
occurrence: Friday, 1506 hours.

393
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:08,973
Start search for Leo Crow. Case 1109,
previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...

394
00:38:09,365 --> 00:38:12,525
...recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's Q-stacks.

395
00:38:12,868 --> 00:38:17,148
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

396
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,740
Good morning.

397
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:21,561
Are you ready
to preview and validate 1109?

398
00:38:21,878 --> 00:38:24,678
- Ready when you are, John.
- Standing by.

399
00:38:30,554 --> 00:38:32,274
I love this part.

400
00:38:33,390 --> 00:38:38,190
I've got no address. No tax returns
for the last five years.

401
00:38:38,562 --> 00:38:41,042
Check NCIC.
Maybe he's got a number.

402
00:38:41,983 --> 00:38:45,583
We'll send a protection team
as soon as we lock location.

403
00:38:48,865 --> 00:38:51,465
It looks like federal housing.
Concrete, glass, egg crates.

404
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:54,703
Ouch. About a thousand of those
in the District.

405
00:38:56,331 --> 00:38:58,051
Fractured images coming in.

406
00:38:58,333 --> 00:39:00,613
Numbers nine...

407
00:39:03,255 --> 00:39:04,895
Nine, six.

408
00:39:09,553 --> 00:39:13,393
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.

409
00:39:14,392 --> 00:39:15,632
She's laughing.

410
00:39:19,271 --> 00:39:21,311
Okay, now I'm inside a room.

411
00:39:22,317 --> 00:39:24,957
Windowpanes, aluminum extrusion.

412
00:39:25,611 --> 00:39:28,651
Two figures resolving in the room.

413
00:39:29,824 --> 00:39:31,864
- Wait!
- No...

414
00:39:35,497 --> 00:39:37,617
Looks like we got a third party.

415
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,144
Wearing sunglasses,
just out the window.

416
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:43,842
You're not gonna kill me.

417
00:39:46,467 --> 00:39:48,067
Goodbye, Crow.

418
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,858
You're not gonna kill me.

419
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:58,231
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Wait!

420
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,232
Wait. Wait.

421
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,660
You say something, chief?

422
00:40:06,946 --> 00:40:08,106
No.

423
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,260
I'll get this one.

424
00:40:13,787 --> 00:40:15,747
We got time on this one, Jad.

425
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:18,837
Mind getting me a piece
of cake they're eating?

426
00:40:19,168 --> 00:40:20,928
- I'm starving.
- Sure, chief.

427
00:40:21,170 --> 00:40:23,890
I think I'll get one for myself too.

428
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:25,613
Take your time.

429
00:40:42,359 --> 00:40:45,879
Chief Anderton,
what is this that I'm seeing?

430
00:40:46,738 --> 00:40:48,178
I'm confused about...

431
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:22,108
- Anderton, wait!
- Goodbye, Crow.

432
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,680
Anderton, wait!

433
00:41:25,612 --> 00:41:27,452
Anderton, wait!

434
00:41:33,704 --> 00:41:37,344
I like you, chief.
You've always been nice to me.

435
00:41:39,752 --> 00:41:42,632
Give you two minutes
before I hit the alarm.

436
00:41:59,148 --> 00:42:00,508
Hold that, please.

437
00:42:01,858 --> 00:42:03,058
Thanks.

438
00:42:06,405 --> 00:42:09,925
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.

439
00:42:10,284 --> 00:42:13,084
I'll write the paranoia off to the
whiff you've been doping on.

440
00:42:13,412 --> 00:42:14,612
Easy.

441
00:42:14,872 --> 00:42:17,032
- Easy.
- Seems I've found a flaw.

442
00:42:19,627 --> 00:42:20,787
What are you gonna do?

443
00:42:21,045 --> 00:42:23,845
Possession will cost you six months
and your badge.

444
00:42:24,132 --> 00:42:26,532
I guess we won't be working together
after all.

445
00:42:26,843 --> 00:42:30,323
Now put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.

446
00:42:51,911 --> 00:42:53,911
Lamar. Lamar.

447
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:58,863
- Lamar?
- John, what is happening?

448
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:01,088
It's Witwer. He set me up!

449
00:43:01,337 --> 00:43:02,617
Stop, just wait.

450
00:43:02,839 --> 00:43:05,679
- Witwer! It's Witwer.
- Who's the victim?

451
00:43:06,009 --> 00:43:07,569
- Somebody.
- Who?

452
00:43:07,844 --> 00:43:09,764
- Somebody... Leo Crow.
- Who is he?

453
00:43:10,055 --> 00:43:12,695
I have no idea!
I've never heard of him.

454
00:43:13,017 --> 00:43:15,897
But I'm supposed to kill him
in less than 36 hours.

455
00:43:16,186 --> 00:43:19,346
- How could Witwer have access?
- Can you fake a cerebral output?

456
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:21,250
- Why would anyone want to?
- Can you?

457
00:43:21,525 --> 00:43:23,765
- I doubt it.
- Would Hineman know?

458
00:43:24,028 --> 00:43:26,028
- Now listen, come in.
- What?

459
00:43:26,322 --> 00:43:28,642
I'll protect you until we
get to the bottom of this.

460
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,870
Talk to Wally. See if Witwer's gone
inside the temple again.

461
00:43:32,203 --> 00:43:35,523
Ask Jad for any off-hour
eye-dents into the analytical room.

462
00:43:36,416 --> 00:43:38,136
Who's Leo Crow?

463
00:43:38,418 --> 00:43:41,098
Security lockdown enabled.
Revised destination: Office.

464
00:43:41,379 --> 00:43:43,979
Lamar, they found me.

465
00:43:48,512 --> 00:43:51,592
Is there any way to override
the lockdown?

466
00:43:51,932 --> 00:43:53,772
- No, no, no.
- No?

467
00:43:54,059 --> 00:43:57,419
I'll meet you anywhere you say.
You can come to my house, John.

468
00:43:57,771 --> 00:44:00,251
I can't. They'll get me.
I'm not gonna get haloed.

469
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:01,646
You can't run.

470
00:44:02,651 --> 00:44:03,851
Everybody runs.

471
00:44:50,952 --> 00:44:52,792
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey.

472
00:45:07,469 --> 00:45:10,029
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

473
00:45:13,393 --> 00:45:15,513
I'll bring him in. Unharmed.

474
00:45:15,811 --> 00:45:18,371
You're not gonna do that.
I'm taking control.

475
00:45:18,648 --> 00:45:19,848
What?

476
00:45:20,108 --> 00:45:24,348
Fletcher is second in command.
It's his show to run. You can observe.

477
00:45:24,737 --> 00:45:27,977
- Do it. Find him.
- Yes, sir.

478
00:45:30,119 --> 00:45:33,599
He came to see you the other day
right before he was tagged.

479
00:45:33,955 --> 00:45:36,435
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.

480
00:45:36,750 --> 00:45:39,470
John doesn't think they have a deep
enough pitching roster.

481
00:45:39,795 --> 00:45:43,515
Why are you protecting him? You knew
he was doping, yet you did nothing.

482
00:45:43,883 --> 00:45:47,083
- The man lost a child, for chrissake.
- Six years ago.

483
00:45:47,428 --> 00:45:50,348
- What did you talk about?
- None of your business.

484
00:45:50,681 --> 00:45:55,001
It's my business. Investigation of a
supervising officer for a capital crime...

485
00:45:55,353 --> 00:45:59,313
...falls under federal jurisdiction
so as to rule out any conspiracy.

486
00:45:59,691 --> 00:46:02,011
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.

487
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,799
Call the attorney general. I'm sure
he'd clarify the issue for you.

488
00:46:06,156 --> 00:46:09,356
I don't want John Anderton hurt.

489
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,650
I'm going to enjoy working here.

490
00:46:16,625 --> 00:46:18,785
A road diverges in the desert.

491
00:46:19,462 --> 00:46:20,742
Lexus.

492
00:46:21,004 --> 00:46:24,724
The road you're on, John Anderton,
is the one less-traveled.

493
00:46:25,092 --> 00:46:28,092
- Make sure you...
- Diamonds...

494
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:32,429
Good evening, John Anderton.

495
00:46:35,729 --> 00:46:39,489
John Anderton! You could use
a Guinness right about now.

496
00:46:42,152 --> 00:46:44,792
- John Anderton...
- Escape from it all.

497
00:46:45,113 --> 00:46:49,593
Get away, John Anderton.
Forget your troubles.

498
00:47:06,761 --> 00:47:11,041
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.
The train stops at 20th and 33rd.

499
00:47:11,432 --> 00:47:13,152
Send units to each location.

500
00:47:13,435 --> 00:47:15,155
- Better make 20th.
- Have faith.

501
00:47:56,271 --> 00:47:57,631
Fire them up!

502
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:23,760
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.

503
00:48:24,008 --> 00:48:26,088
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.

504
00:48:26,344 --> 00:48:28,704
- Work on that.
- It's the shit knee of mine.

505
00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:30,854
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.

506
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:33,443
Hey, don't do this.

507
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:35,469
John?

508
00:48:35,854 --> 00:48:37,134
Don't run.

509
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,650
You don't have to chase me.

510
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,917
You don't have to run.

511
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,119
Everybody runs, Fletch.

512
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:46,325
You know we'll catch you.

513
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:49,048
Everybody runs.

514
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,039
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.

515
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:57,414
Get your sick-sticks ready.

516
00:48:58,878 --> 00:49:00,558
Everybody runs, Fletch.

517
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:03,653
Slow down, chief. Just take it easy.

518
00:49:07,763 --> 00:49:09,603
No sudden moves, chief.

519
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,810
John, it's okay.

520
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:15,472
- Fletch...
- Easy does it, chief.

521
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:45,375
Got a grip?

522
00:49:45,594 --> 00:49:47,274
- Got a grip?
- Yeah.

523
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,485
Anderton!

524
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:51,301
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

525
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:54,541
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house! Go!

526
00:50:57,669 --> 00:51:00,069
- Get them out of here!
- Anderton, stop!

527
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:02,939
Pull him off me, Fletcher.
Get him off me.

528
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,840
Get him out of here!
What's the matter with you?!

529
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,180
Get out of my house! Go!

530
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:39,955
By mandate of the District of Columbia,
I'm placing you under arrest for...

531
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:41,619
Go to sleep.

532
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,050
You two stay with me!

533
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:36,341
Dr. Hineman.

534
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:40,105
You're trespassing.
I don't have visitors.

535
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:48,414
That would be from the doll's eye,
the vine...

536
00:56:48,703 --> 00:56:51,903
...the baneberry that scratched you
during your illegal climb over my wall.

537
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:55,887
It's not a true doll's eye.
It's a little hybrid I designed.

538
00:56:56,253 --> 00:56:59,853
Once the poison gets into your
bloodstream, you'll start to see...

539
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:04,216
...the most extraordinary display
of blue objects.

540
00:57:04,553 --> 00:57:07,913
This just isn't your week, is it?

541
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,999
Chief Anderton.

542
00:57:13,479 --> 00:57:14,999
I'm not a killer.

543
00:57:21,112 --> 00:57:22,512
You better drink this.

544
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:26,661
Soon you won't be able to swallow,
and then you'll be totally buggered.

545
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,278
All of it.

546
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,360
Okay, now take a minute
to right yourself.

547
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:38,316
Just what is it you think
I can do for you?

548
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:45,165
You could tell me how someone
can fake a prevision.

549
00:57:45,555 --> 00:57:47,435
How would I know that?

550
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:50,291
Because you invented Precrime.

551
00:57:52,437 --> 00:57:53,957
What's so funny?

552
00:57:54,522 --> 00:57:59,402
If the consequences of several genetic
mistakes and science gone haywire...

553
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:02,537
...can be called an invention,
then I invented Precrime.

554
00:58:02,864 --> 00:58:04,784
- You don't seem proud.
- I'm not.

555
00:58:05,075 --> 00:58:08,115
I was trying to heal them,
not turn them into something else.

556
00:58:08,412 --> 00:58:11,092
- Heal who?
- The innocents we use to stop the guilty.

557
00:58:11,415 --> 00:58:14,495
You're talking about the Pre-Cogs.

558
00:58:14,836 --> 00:58:19,796
You think they came from a test tube?
They are merely the ones who survived.

559
00:58:20,216 --> 00:58:23,856
I was doing genetic research,
treating children of drug addicts.

560
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,700
This was 10 years ago,
when neuroin first hit the streets.

561
00:58:28,058 --> 00:58:33,978
It was impure, not the engineered
cocktail popular among the educated.

562
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:40,668
All of these kids were born with severe
brain damage. Most died before age 12.

563
00:58:41,113 --> 00:58:43,713
Those few who survived,
they had a gift.

564
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:47,191
I call it a gift. For them,
it was more like a cosmic joke.

565
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:50,177
They would wake up in the night,
curled in the corner...

566
00:58:50,497 --> 00:58:52,337
...screaming, clawing at the walls.

567
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:56,785
Because when these children
closed their eyes at night...

568
00:58:57,129 --> 00:59:01,409
...they dreamt only of murder
over and over, one after the other.

569
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,200
It didn't take for us long to realize
that the real nightmare was...

570
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:10,315
...that these dreams were about to come
true, these murders were happening.

571
00:59:14,439 --> 00:59:16,759
You say some of the children died?

572
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:20,147
So many of them.
Despite what we did for them.

573
00:59:20,487 --> 00:59:24,567
Or maybe because of what we
did to them. But it doesn't matter.

574
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,630
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

575
00:59:28,871 --> 00:59:30,911
I'm not going to commit murder.

576
00:59:31,207 --> 00:59:33,487
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.

577
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:37,873
And yet a chain of events has started
that will lead you to his murder.

578
00:59:38,256 --> 00:59:40,936
- Not if I stay away from him.
- Can you avoid a man you've never met?

579
00:59:41,259 --> 00:59:44,099
- You won't help?
- I can't help you. Nobody can.

580
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,110
The Pre-Cogs are never wrong.

581
00:59:49,601 --> 00:59:51,641
But occasionally...

582
00:59:52,271 --> 00:59:54,311
...they do disagree.

583
00:59:55,899 --> 00:59:57,019
What?

584
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:01,879
Most of the time, all three Pre-Cogs
will see an event in the same way...

585
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,039
...but once in a while, one of them will
see things differently than the others.

586
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:10,249
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't I know about this?

587
01:00:11,165 --> 01:00:14,245
Because these Minority Reports
are destroyed the instant they occur.

588
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:15,664
Why?

589
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:20,639
For Precrime to function, there can't
be any suggestion of fallibility.

590
01:00:21,009 --> 01:00:24,009
Who wants a justice system
that instills doubt?

591
01:00:24,305 --> 01:00:27,105
It may be reasonable,
but it's still doubt.

592
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:31,362
Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?

593
01:00:31,645 --> 01:00:35,245
I'm saying that every so often,
those accused of a Precrime...

594
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:38,046
...just might have
an alternate future.

595
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:42,079
Does Burgess know about this,
about this Minority Report?

596
01:00:42,448 --> 01:00:45,848
I used to joke with Lamar that
we were the parents of Precrime.

597
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,880
Parents often see their children as they
want them to be and not as they are.

598
01:00:51,249 --> 01:00:56,209
Answer my question: Does Lamar
Burgess know about the Minority Report?

599
01:00:56,588 --> 01:00:58,188
Yes, of course, he knew.

600
01:00:58,423 --> 01:01:03,463
But at the time, we felt their existence
was an insignificant variable.

601
01:01:03,846 --> 01:01:05,726
Insignificant to you, maybe.

602
01:01:05,972 --> 01:01:09,612
But what about those people that
I put away with alternate futures?

603
01:01:09,977 --> 01:01:13,497
- My God, if the country knew...
- The system would collapse.

604
01:01:15,691 --> 01:01:18,211
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?

605
01:01:18,486 --> 01:01:20,046
You wanna bring it down.

606
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,040
You will bring it down
if you manage to kill your victim.

607
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:29,247
That'll be the most spectacular public
display of how Precrime didn't work.

608
01:01:29,623 --> 01:01:32,463
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.

609
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:36,071
- Why should I trust you?
- You shouldn't trust anyone.

610
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,500
Certainly not the attorney general,
who wants it all for himself.

611
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,440
And not the young federal agent,
who wants your job.

612
01:01:42,761 --> 01:01:46,801
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang on to what he created.

613
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,420
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the Minority Report.

614
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,160
You said the Minority Report
is destroyed.

615
01:01:54,482 --> 01:01:58,042
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.

616
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:03,401
I designed it so the report is stored
in a safe place, but not declared.

617
01:02:03,783 --> 01:02:05,983
What safe place is that?

618
01:02:06,244 --> 01:02:09,364
The safest place there is.

619
01:02:09,707 --> 01:02:12,547
Where is it?

620
01:02:14,795 --> 01:02:18,635
Inside the Pre-Cog who predicted it.

621
01:02:23,387 --> 01:02:27,747
All you have to do
is download it, darling.

622
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:31,118
That's all, huh?

623
01:02:34,608 --> 01:02:37,328
Just walk into Precrime,
get into the temple...

624
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:42,090
...somehow tap into these Pre-Cogs
and download this Minority Report.

625
01:02:42,449 --> 01:02:44,849
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.

626
01:02:45,118 --> 01:02:49,438
Actually, you'll have to run out.
But yes, that's what you have to do.

627
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:52,459
You're insane.

628
01:02:53,168 --> 01:02:55,208
Or you think I am.

629
01:02:55,462 --> 01:03:00,462
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times
before I get within 10 miles of Precrime.

630
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:05,483
Sometimes in order to see the light,
you have to risk the dark.

631
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:09,049
As a policeman...
Excuse me, as a former policeman...

632
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,952
...I'm sure that you know
all sorts of people...

633
01:03:12,272 --> 01:03:15,432
...who can help you out
in this regard.

634
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:24,618
It's funny how all
living organisms are alike.

635
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:28,469
When the chips are down,
when the pressure is on...

636
01:03:28,789 --> 01:03:31,629
...every creature
on the face of the earth...

637
01:03:31,918 --> 01:03:35,238
...is interested in one thing
and one thing only:

638
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,500
Its own survival.

639
01:03:40,218 --> 01:03:42,298
Find the Minority Report.

640
01:03:47,476 --> 01:03:50,116
How do I even know which one has it?

641
01:03:50,395 --> 01:03:53,595
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

642
01:03:55,317 --> 01:03:57,157
Which one is that?

643
01:04:00,197 --> 01:04:01,997
The female.

644
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,720
We've got three men in a room.
The victim is here...

645
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,079
...John is here, and this
unidentified male, at the window.

646
01:04:13,419 --> 01:04:17,099
The adjacent building suggests
public housing, which means...

647
01:04:17,423 --> 01:04:20,143
- There's thousands like this one.
- They're everywhere.

648
01:04:20,427 --> 01:04:23,227
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

649
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:25,633
This is Chief Anderton's space.

650
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:27,730
- He's not here.
- He'll be back.

651
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:31,576
I doubt that. I'm betting
he's somewhere in the Sprawl.

652
01:04:31,897 --> 01:04:35,577
He's smart enough to go
where billboards can't ID him.

653
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:38,181
There's fewer consumers,
which means fewer scanners.

654
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:42,525
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.

655
01:04:43,951 --> 01:04:45,711
We concentrate on the Sprawl.

656
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:48,873
We do fly-overs in ships,
with two spyder teams on the ground.

657
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:53,325
Thermal scan the entire area. Read
anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

658
01:05:09,353 --> 01:05:10,593
Where is she?

659
01:05:29,165 --> 01:05:34,925
Started blowing buttons for no reason
whatsoever, and I knew that.

660
01:05:38,758 --> 01:05:40,758
This damn cold.

661
01:05:42,012 --> 01:05:46,092
Don't worry. I could cut open your
chest and sew a dead cat in there...

662
01:05:46,433 --> 01:05:50,913
...you wouldn't get an infection. Not
with the antibios I'll shoot into you.

663
01:05:51,271 --> 01:05:52,711
That's comforting.

664
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:56,220
You do understand I can't just
give you new irises?

665
01:05:56,527 --> 01:05:57,927
Please, don't touch.

666
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,954
Because the scanners would read the
new scar tissue, alarms will go off...

667
01:06:02,283 --> 01:06:04,763
...and large men with guns will appear.

668
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:09,009
What was that?

669
01:06:09,248 --> 01:06:10,368
What was that?

670
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:15,023
- It's anesthesia. It's all downhill...
- You always sneak up on your patients?

671
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:19,340
You wouldn't break the hand
of a violinist before the concert.

672
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:21,236
Please, relax.

673
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:30,929
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll
have to remove your eyes completely.

674
01:06:31,313 --> 01:06:32,433
I know.

675
01:06:33,399 --> 01:06:37,439
- I have to replace them with new ones.
- I know. But I wanna keep the old ones.

676
01:06:37,779 --> 01:06:41,299
- Why?
- Because my mother gave them to me.

677
01:06:41,616 --> 01:06:43,896
What's it to you?
You can't resell them.

678
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,960
Whatever you say. It's your money.

679
01:06:54,338 --> 01:06:58,818
Let me introduce my gorgeous
assistant, Miss Van Eyck.

680
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:24,021
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.

681
01:07:27,122 --> 01:07:28,682
Okay.

682
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:35,784
- What did you give me?
- Smile medicine.

683
01:07:36,089 --> 01:07:38,489
Tell you what, since we go way back...

684
01:07:38,759 --> 01:07:42,879
...why don't I give you my old pal
discount? What do you say?

685
01:07:43,222 --> 01:07:45,382
You don't remember me, do you?

686
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:49,001
- We know each other?
- Yes, we do.

687
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:51,275
From where? D.C.?

688
01:07:51,523 --> 01:07:55,923
- Baltimore. The East Side.
- Baltimore? We go way back.

689
01:07:56,277 --> 01:08:00,157
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D.
I was a plastic surgeon.

690
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:05,530
You remember? Specialized
in burn victims, mostly women.

691
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:09,433
- I put you away.
- Yeah, you did.

692
01:08:11,376 --> 01:08:13,536
You made those tapes.

693
01:08:13,796 --> 01:08:16,276
They were performance pieces.

694
01:08:17,674 --> 01:08:21,674
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out.

695
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:27,173
Some not as quickly as others, but
let's change the subject, shall we?

696
01:08:29,145 --> 01:08:34,585
The future's so much more interesting
than the past, don't you think?

697
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:41,409
Miss Van Eyck.
I'm afraid she's already smitten.

698
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:46,318
She only has eyes for you.

699
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:51,178
I know what you're thinking, John:
How can I do what I do now?

700
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:56,022
Let's say that I spent an awful lot
of time in the prison library.

701
01:08:56,382 --> 01:09:01,382
That was a great way to avoid the more
unpleasant aspects of prison life.

702
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:05,003
Confinement was
a real education, a real...

703
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,708
...eye-opener.

704
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:16,273
For true enlightenment,
there's nothing quite like...

705
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:19,810
...well, let's say, taking a shower
while this large fellow...

706
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:23,517
...with an attitude you can't
knock down with a hammer...

707
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,907
...whispers in your ear, "Oh, Nancy. "

708
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:29,683
That was a lot of fun.
Thank you for putting me there...

709
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,080
...and giving me the opportunity to
get to know myself so much better.

710
01:09:34,422 --> 01:09:36,782
And now to return the favor.

711
01:09:48,269 --> 01:09:51,229
- This your work?
- Yes.

712
01:09:52,024 --> 01:09:53,544
I like it.

713
01:09:53,776 --> 01:09:56,736
- How do you take your coffee?
- Cream and sugar.

714
01:09:57,029 --> 01:09:59,469
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.
- Just sugar then.

715
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,020
- You and John ever come here?
- We used to.

716
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,045
He's not here now, is he?

717
01:10:06,288 --> 01:10:08,048
I had to ask.

718
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:13,382
- I don't have any sugar either.
- Thank you.

719
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:16,511
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.

720
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,320
Did he ever mention the name
Leo Crow?

721
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:22,354
No, but I don't talk
to John much anymore.

722
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:26,079
- So you haven't seen his apartment.
- That was our apartment.

723
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:29,233
Have you been there recently?
It's full of these.

724
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:33,961
- How long has he been doping?
- Since right after we lost our son.

725
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:39,558
- You mean after he lost your son.
- It was nobody's fault.

726
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:45,367
But John was with him
at the public pool.

727
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:48,393
You said in your divorce papers
that John tried to kill himself.

728
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:51,866
- It wasn't a suicide attempt.
- What was it then?

729
01:10:52,169 --> 01:10:56,089
The FBI found something
that belonged to my son, a sandal.

730
01:10:56,424 --> 01:10:57,944
John was upset. He...

731
01:10:58,218 --> 01:11:01,058
He took out his gun
and watched home movies.

732
01:11:01,346 --> 01:11:05,466
- This is all in your statement.
- He shot a hole in the ceiling. So what?

733
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:09,329
You lose your son,
let's see how well you handle it.

734
01:11:09,896 --> 01:11:14,776
Lamar thinks you left John because he
lost himself in Precrime instead of you.

735
01:11:15,486 --> 01:11:20,006
I left him because every time
I looked at him, I saw my son.

736
01:11:21,075 --> 01:11:25,355
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.

737
01:11:25,705 --> 01:11:28,225
That's why I left him.

738
01:11:29,334 --> 01:11:31,454
And now you can leave.

739
01:11:33,504 --> 01:11:36,544
Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

740
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:45,591
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

741
01:11:46,894 --> 01:11:50,734
In the fridge, there's milk.
Greta made you a sandwich.

742
01:11:51,065 --> 01:11:53,785
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

743
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:55,988
How do I find the bathroom?

744
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,970
The bathroom?
Now that's your right hand.

745
01:12:02,661 --> 01:12:05,181
The kitchen is your left.

746
01:12:07,498 --> 01:12:10,218
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

747
01:12:10,752 --> 01:12:15,232
Seeing as we're being pals, I'll give
you a bonus that may come in handy.

748
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:19,790
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.
You're gonna shoot this under your chin.

749
01:12:20,304 --> 01:12:23,544
- What is this?
- It'll turn your pretty face into mush.

750
01:12:23,849 --> 01:12:26,169
People won't even recognize you.

751
01:12:26,435 --> 01:12:30,595
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again.
But it'll hurt like you've never felt.

752
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:34,780
I'm gonna put this in your goody-bag,
together with your...

753
01:12:35,153 --> 01:12:36,913
...leftovers.

754
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:44,096
I'm setting up a timer. When it rings,
you can remove the bandages and leave.

755
01:12:44,496 --> 01:12:48,296
- But not before then, or you will...
- Go blind. I know.

756
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,465
Don't scratch.

757
01:12:51,503 --> 01:12:56,063
A little something from
a mutual friend of ours.

758
01:13:32,963 --> 01:13:35,443
Don 't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

759
01:13:36,508 --> 01:13:41,068
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

760
01:14:01,952 --> 01:14:06,552
- 25. 16 seconds. That's a new record.
- Is that a world record?

761
01:14:06,915 --> 01:14:10,275
Is it a world record?
It's a personal best.

762
01:14:10,586 --> 01:14:13,506
- Now I wanna time you.
- You gotta be kidding.

763
01:14:13,798 --> 01:14:16,638
There's no way
I can beat 25. 16 seconds.

764
01:14:16,926 --> 01:14:19,646
How long can a whale hold its breath?

765
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:22,009
For about 20 minutes.

766
01:14:22,265 --> 01:14:25,465
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.

767
01:14:27,312 --> 01:14:29,632
We gotta beat the whale.

768
01:14:30,357 --> 01:14:31,637
Here you go.

769
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:35,578
It's gonna be 20 minutes. You sure
you don't wanna go for an ice cream?

770
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:38,784
Because you know
I'm gonna beat that whale.

771
01:14:39,324 --> 01:14:40,884
- Ready?
- Give me the count.

772
01:14:41,118 --> 01:14:43,278
Three, two, one, go!

773
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:02,537
Sean?

774
01:15:05,393 --> 01:15:06,553
Sean?

775
01:15:09,564 --> 01:15:10,844
Sean.

776
01:15:17,406 --> 01:15:19,086
Have you seen...?

777
01:15:20,701 --> 01:15:25,021
I'm looking for my son. Have you
seen a boy in a red bathing suit?

778
01:15:26,874 --> 01:15:30,234
You seen my boy?
He's wearing a red bathing suit.

779
01:17:18,449 --> 01:17:23,169
Jad, we're ready to begin thermal scan
on all residences on North Powell.

780
01:17:24,414 --> 01:17:26,814
You must really like me, don't you?

781
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,843
That's why you asked to partner
with me on this sortie.

782
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:31,528
You're swell company.

783
01:17:31,754 --> 01:17:34,914
It's not that you don't trust me
to be alone with the chief, is it?

784
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,377
That you think I might, you know,
futz with him?

785
01:17:37,635 --> 01:17:41,355
No, I just wanna watch him use your
body to sandblast another building.

786
01:17:41,682 --> 01:17:42,682
Evanna, go.

787
01:17:43,184 --> 01:17:46,464
I show 27 warm bodies.

788
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:49,490
Roger that. Confirmed, 27 warm bodies.

789
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:54,534
- Four spyders, one per floor?
- Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

790
01:18:10,128 --> 01:18:15,128
Residents of 931 Powell, this is
Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime.

791
01:18:15,509 --> 01:18:20,589
Under authority of P.C. section 6409, we
are deploying spyders into your complex.

792
01:18:22,016 --> 01:18:24,296
Mom, I'm scared.

793
01:18:24,602 --> 01:18:27,002
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

794
01:18:27,271 --> 01:18:31,071
That's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Stay still.

795
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:33,161
- It's okay.
- I don't like it.

796
01:18:33,403 --> 01:18:35,403
Stay still. Stay still.

797
01:18:59,012 --> 01:19:00,132
Come on!

798
01:19:00,347 --> 01:19:02,827
You stepped out on me
for the last time.

799
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,620
I told you where I was.

800
01:19:04,852 --> 01:19:07,652
You're a no-good liar.
I know you was with that ho.

801
01:19:07,938 --> 01:19:09,498
You're lucky we...

802
01:19:13,778 --> 01:19:15,778
Leave me alone!

803
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,674
We lost one.

804
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:37,871
Roger that. Maybe it was
a cat jumping through a window.

805
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:40,050
It's an awful big cat.

806
01:20:40,285 --> 01:20:41,605
Fletcher.

807
01:20:42,663 --> 01:20:44,543
I'll go check it out.

808
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:26,320
They're crying their eyes out.
You terrified them.

809
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:28,745
Keep your kids away from me.

810
01:21:44,185 --> 01:21:48,385
The big cat's back. What do you think?
A drunk, maybe can't wake up?

811
01:21:48,732 --> 01:21:51,252
Or a guy who doesn't want to get read.

812
01:21:51,526 --> 01:21:54,006
Folks, be quiet, go back inside.

813
01:22:04,999 --> 01:22:07,119
Be quiet and close the door.

814
01:22:14,258 --> 01:22:16,458
We got an ID. It's not him.

815
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:21,232
- Standing down.
- Let's eat.

816
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:37,419
Fletcher, take a look.

817
01:22:39,201 --> 01:22:42,281
There's four people in this room,
not three.

818
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:45,940
Four? There's Anderton, Crow
and the man in sunglasses.

819
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:49,411
The man in the sunglasses
is outside the window.

820
01:22:52,007 --> 01:22:56,487
There's also someone here
in the mirror.

821
01:22:57,345 --> 01:22:59,385
Definitely female.

822
01:22:59,932 --> 01:23:04,012
The Precrime program began in 2046
with a federal grant.

823
01:23:04,353 --> 01:23:09,393
And now, nine years later,
D.C. is the safest city in America.

824
01:23:09,776 --> 01:23:12,056
Why? Because Precrime works.

825
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:15,439
Precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives.

826
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:20,380
What happens now is the verification
and protection of future victims.

827
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:22,305
Can we see the Pre-Cogs?

828
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,859
They have such a powerful gift,
they're kept in peaceful seclusion...

829
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,130
...so as not to be distracted.

830
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:33,699
This display should give you some idea
of what their daily life is like.

831
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:38,315
The Pre-Cogs get over
8 million letters every year.

832
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,559
That's more than Santa Claus gets.

833
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:44,328
Each Pre-Cog has their own bedroom,
TV and weight room.

834
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,725
It's wonderful to be a Pre-Cog.

835
01:24:12,174 --> 01:24:14,654
My mom's new boyfriend
came over again last night.

836
01:24:14,969 --> 01:24:17,129
He's just not very intelligent.

837
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:22,987
My mom wouldn't let me eat upstairs.
I had to listen to him go on and on.

838
01:24:31,945 --> 01:24:33,625
Shit!

839
01:24:51,548 --> 01:24:54,268
Eye-dent: John Anderton.
Approved for entry.

840
01:24:58,472 --> 01:25:02,232
- Which I told her I'd be able to do.
I'm so good at taking care of you.

841
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,920
But she thinks I'll be irresponsible.
It's ridiculous because...

842
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:13,249
You can't be in here.
What are you doing here?

843
01:25:17,868 --> 01:25:20,588
Easy there, old-timer.
Who cleared you?

844
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:22,830
- You're not allowed here.
- Listen, Wally.

845
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:24,761
- Do I know you?
- I like you.

846
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,960
So I don't wanna have
to kick you or hit you.

847
01:25:28,254 --> 01:25:30,654
But only if you promise to help me.

848
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:33,764
Hi, John.

849
01:25:42,185 --> 01:25:44,505
Who does that look like to you?

850
01:25:46,105 --> 01:25:47,785
I don't know.

851
01:25:51,695 --> 01:25:55,815
It's Agatha.
He's coming here to get her.

852
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,160
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.

853
01:26:04,124 --> 01:26:06,404
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

854
01:26:06,669 --> 01:26:10,909
They don't come out in any order.
I'm getting them as she's giving them.

855
01:26:14,177 --> 01:26:15,937
Can you see?

856
01:26:29,442 --> 01:26:32,162
- He's inside.
- He has some kind of mask on.

857
01:26:32,446 --> 01:26:34,326
- He sealed the door.
- Shit!

858
01:26:34,572 --> 01:26:37,372
Nobody fires a weapon inside
the temple. Use bindfoam.

859
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:40,979
- Is there another way out of there?
- All the doors are covered.

860
01:26:41,289 --> 01:26:46,689
John, move away from the tank.
Move away from the tank, John.

861
01:27:04,104 --> 01:27:05,944
What does he want with a Pre-Cog?

862
01:27:06,190 --> 01:27:09,270
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing.

863
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:14,608
Well, there's still the other two.
The other two can still function, right?

864
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:21,030
They're a hive mind. It takes all three
for their predictive abilities to work.

865
01:27:23,415 --> 01:27:25,255
They can't see murders anymore?

866
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:29,181
Agatha, she's the key.
She's the one they listen to...

867
01:27:29,506 --> 01:27:31,626
...the one with the most talent.

868
01:27:31,883 --> 01:27:35,163
- She takes care of the other two.
- Jesus.

869
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:39,390
- Please bring her back.
- Every team underground, now!

870
01:27:39,724 --> 01:27:42,684
- It doesn't matter. He wins.
- We'll stop him.

871
01:27:42,978 --> 01:27:47,658
She's with him when he kills Crow.
She's already a part of his future.

872
01:27:48,024 --> 01:27:51,264
Jad, put everything you've got into
finding that room, and we stop a murder.

873
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:54,690
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got...

874
01:27:55,158 --> 01:27:57,598
...51 minutes, 30 seconds.

875
01:27:59,871 --> 01:28:02,751
You cold? Can you understand me?

876
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:06,841
Are you cold? The shivers,
it's the drugs we gave you.

877
01:28:07,170 --> 01:28:11,290
It should wear off soon.
I'm sorry. I need your help.

878
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:15,272
You contain information.
I need to know how to get at it.

879
01:28:16,471 --> 01:28:19,311
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?

880
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,400
- Is it now?
- What?

881
01:28:21,643 --> 01:28:23,403
Is it now?

882
01:28:25,105 --> 01:28:28,465
Yes, this is all happening right now.

883
01:28:29,318 --> 01:28:31,438
I'm taking you some place in public...

884
01:28:31,695 --> 01:28:34,415
...which means you need
something else to wear.

885
01:28:34,699 --> 01:28:38,579
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.

886
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:47,580
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto,
welcome back to the Gap.

887
01:28:47,879 --> 01:28:51,079
How'd those assorted tank tops
work out for you?

888
01:28:51,550 --> 01:28:53,670
Mr. Yakamoto?

889
01:28:57,890 --> 01:29:03,290
Miss Belfor, did you come back for
another pair of those chammy lace-ups?

890
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:21,570
- If it's ransom, where's the damn note?
- It has nothing to do with ransom.

891
01:29:21,915 --> 01:29:25,555
It has to do with the information
inside of Agatha.

892
01:29:26,836 --> 01:29:31,236
- He's trying to prove his innocence.
- He can't download her without support.

893
01:29:31,592 --> 01:29:34,072
Your average consumer can't buy
any of this stuff.

894
01:29:34,344 --> 01:29:38,664
It's been assembled and scrounged
from spare parts made to order.

895
01:29:40,059 --> 01:29:43,659
Assuming Anderton ordered this,
who put it together?

896
01:29:53,239 --> 01:29:56,199
Who's Rufus T. Riley?

897
01:29:58,453 --> 01:30:01,213
What's your pleasure? We got it
all here: Sports fantasies...

898
01:30:01,498 --> 01:30:03,538
..."Look, Ma, I can fly" fantasies...

899
01:30:03,792 --> 01:30:07,752
...which covers everything from bungee
jumping to flying over the Grand Canyon.

900
01:30:08,088 --> 01:30:10,448
You can experience sex as a woman.

901
01:30:10,716 --> 01:30:14,436
Women come in to get laid
by their favorite soap star.

902
01:30:14,761 --> 01:30:17,481
Or just some good, clean fun.

903
01:30:20,226 --> 01:30:23,106
It's a big rush, but you come out
without a heart attack.

904
01:30:23,395 --> 01:30:26,115
I wanna kill my boss.

905
01:30:27,734 --> 01:30:28,854
Okay.

906
01:30:29,528 --> 01:30:33,328
- You got some images I can work with?
- Rufus.

907
01:30:33,823 --> 01:30:37,143
Yeah, being concertmaster
for the Philadelphia Symphony...

908
01:30:37,453 --> 01:30:39,133
...is a popular choice.

909
01:30:39,371 --> 01:30:42,051
- I wanna kill my boss.
- You sick bastard.

910
01:30:42,332 --> 01:30:45,132
You make this a terrible world
to live in!

911
01:30:45,419 --> 01:30:49,419
Detective, nice of you to come here,
seeing how every cop is looking for you.

912
01:30:49,757 --> 01:30:52,317
- I need your help.
- Why'd you come here?

913
01:30:52,593 --> 01:30:55,673
- I make house calls.
- I need your help with her.

914
01:30:55,971 --> 01:30:59,451
Hello, honey pie.
I'm impressed. You're on the lam...

915
01:30:59,809 --> 01:31:03,849
...and you still have the time to
slice off a little... jerky for yourself.

916
01:31:04,188 --> 01:31:07,268
- She's a Pre-Cog.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

917
01:31:07,567 --> 01:31:09,727
- That's right.
- She's a Pre-Cog.

918
01:31:11,613 --> 01:31:14,893
You brought a Pre-Cog here.

919
01:31:28,964 --> 01:31:30,884
Jesus Christ.

920
01:31:31,467 --> 01:31:34,267
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.

921
01:31:34,762 --> 01:31:39,962
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do.
I swear I didn't do that stuff I did.

922
01:31:42,562 --> 01:31:46,402
She has information inside her.
I need you to get it out.

923
01:31:46,733 --> 01:31:49,813
No way. I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

924
01:31:50,112 --> 01:31:53,432
Those thoughts about my cousin
were just thoughts.

925
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,060
- You've been busted for felony hacking.
- So?

926
01:31:56,327 --> 01:31:58,647
So I need you to hack into her.

927
01:32:01,790 --> 01:32:06,630
I do this, I get to keep
whatever images I get from her head.

928
01:32:07,005 --> 01:32:10,725
- They don't belong to anybody.
- Take her to RadioShack.

929
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:13,910
You're gonna help me.

930
01:32:20,393 --> 01:32:24,793
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see
what's gonna happen to me.

931
01:32:26,191 --> 01:32:27,871
And then we'll go.

932
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:45,315
- She works.
- Slow it down.

933
01:32:46,546 --> 01:32:50,186
How do I slow this down?
I should hit her on the head?

934
01:32:56,222 --> 01:32:59,182
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.

935
01:32:59,893 --> 01:33:01,613
Yeah, recording.

936
01:33:28,215 --> 01:33:30,735
I know this already.
Come on. Move on.

937
01:33:34,054 --> 01:33:35,614
Goodbye, Crow.

938
01:33:36,557 --> 01:33:38,117
Goodbye, Crow.

939
01:33:46,233 --> 01:33:48,353
- What happened?
- I don't know.

940
01:33:48,611 --> 01:33:50,211
- What happened?
- I don't...

941
01:33:50,446 --> 01:33:53,726
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.

942
01:33:55,242 --> 01:33:59,082
Where's my Minority Report?

943
01:34:00,624 --> 01:34:02,944
Do I even have one?

944
01:34:07,798 --> 01:34:10,838
- Do I have one?
- No.

945
01:34:12,636 --> 01:34:15,076
- What?
- No.

946
01:34:22,980 --> 01:34:24,300
What?

947
01:34:24,565 --> 01:34:27,605
Agatha? What? What?

948
01:34:27,943 --> 01:34:30,663
- Can you see?
- See what?

949
01:34:46,838 --> 01:34:48,638
Anne Lively.

950
01:34:56,599 --> 01:35:01,079
You want me to see who killed
Anne Lively. Are you recording this?

951
01:35:01,437 --> 01:35:04,317
Yeah, but it's pouring
out of her backwards.

952
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:12,217
I like my life. Everything's good.

953
01:35:23,460 --> 01:35:25,100
They're inside.

954
01:35:25,754 --> 01:35:27,314
Who?

955
01:35:28,382 --> 01:35:30,182
All your old teammates.

956
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:34,019
Kenny, left chamber.
Alan, straight across.

957
01:35:34,305 --> 01:35:35,305
Negative!

958
01:35:36,474 --> 01:35:37,874
- Negative!
- Negative!

959
01:35:38,101 --> 01:35:39,541
I don't deserve that.

960
01:35:39,768 --> 01:35:42,168
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.

961
01:35:49,070 --> 01:35:51,230
Can you see the umbrella?

962
01:35:51,865 --> 01:35:53,465
Take it.

963
01:35:53,742 --> 01:35:55,342
Take it!

964
01:35:59,498 --> 01:36:03,858
A man in a blue suit.
He drops his briefcase.

965
01:36:11,259 --> 01:36:15,099
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.

966
01:36:16,724 --> 01:36:18,564
Turn in here.

967
01:36:25,275 --> 01:36:26,795
Let's go.

968
01:36:32,365 --> 01:36:34,285
- Wait.
- No, we can't stop here.

969
01:36:34,535 --> 01:36:36,535
Can you see the balloon man?

970
01:36:38,830 --> 01:36:40,230
Wait.

971
01:36:43,044 --> 01:36:46,684
- Wait.
- What are we waiting for?

972
01:36:51,885 --> 01:36:54,005
Wait. Wait.

973
01:36:54,555 --> 01:36:56,075
Wait.

974
01:36:56,557 --> 01:36:59,717
- Please, Mommy, can I have one?
- All right.

975
01:37:02,271 --> 01:37:03,271
Wait.

976
01:37:08,486 --> 01:37:10,326
Thank you.

977
01:37:10,864 --> 01:37:13,864
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.

978
01:37:14,159 --> 01:37:18,479
Scott, Ramos, take the east end.
Everyone else, follow me. Let's go.

979
01:37:30,385 --> 01:37:32,905
He knows. Don't go home.

980
01:37:41,479 --> 01:37:42,799
We've got eyes on.

981
01:37:43,022 --> 01:37:45,582
They're working,
but they're standing on it.

982
01:37:45,859 --> 01:37:48,659
Please! Please!
Have you got a quarter?

983
01:37:48,945 --> 01:37:50,825
Drop some money.

984
01:37:53,117 --> 01:37:55,957
Can't you put it in my hand?

985
01:37:56,245 --> 01:37:58,765
May the Lord bless you.

986
01:37:59,039 --> 01:38:02,559
May God take care of you.

987
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:23,684
Damn!

988
01:38:52,512 --> 01:38:55,952
That's the guy.
The man in the window.

989
01:39:12,366 --> 01:39:16,126
- Rooms are 95 a night.
- Mind if I look at the registry?

990
01:39:16,454 --> 01:39:18,134
I mind.

991
01:39:18,622 --> 01:39:19,902
How about now?

992
01:39:20,207 --> 01:39:22,007
Help yourself.

993
01:39:35,640 --> 01:39:37,040
He's here.

994
01:39:37,684 --> 01:39:39,724
Anderton, leave.

995
01:39:46,694 --> 01:39:49,534
You have a choice.
Walk away. Do it now.

996
01:39:49,822 --> 01:39:53,342
I can't. I have to find out
what happened in my life.

997
01:39:53,659 --> 01:39:54,779
Please.

998
01:39:54,994 --> 01:39:58,994
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.

999
01:39:59,332 --> 01:40:01,452
- What room is Crow in?
- 1006.

1000
01:40:02,419 --> 01:40:03,939
Come on.

1001
01:40:04,296 --> 01:40:05,456
Come on.

1002
01:41:24,755 --> 01:41:26,435
Wrong room.

1003
01:41:55,287 --> 01:41:56,767
Leave.

1004
01:41:57,289 --> 01:41:58,689
Leave.

1005
01:42:55,308 --> 01:42:56,708
Oh, God.

1006
01:43:01,564 --> 01:43:02,804
This is Sean.

1007
01:43:03,483 --> 01:43:05,123
My son.

1008
01:43:09,364 --> 01:43:14,884
Every day for the last six years
I've thought about only two things:

1009
01:43:16,371 --> 01:43:20,611
The first is what my son would
look like if he were alive today...

1010
01:43:21,836 --> 01:43:25,476
...if I would recognize him
if I saw him on the street.

1011
01:43:29,219 --> 01:43:32,779
And the second is what I would do
to the man who took him.

1012
01:43:37,811 --> 01:43:39,371
You're right.

1013
01:43:40,855 --> 01:43:42,495
I'm not being set up.

1014
01:43:45,736 --> 01:43:48,096
You have to take me home.

1015
01:43:53,828 --> 01:43:57,628
You said so yourself.
There is no Minority Report.

1016
01:43:57,957 --> 01:44:00,597
I don't have an alternate future.

1017
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:04,320
I am going to kill this man.

1018
01:44:07,133 --> 01:44:11,253
You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.

1019
01:44:11,596 --> 01:44:14,116
You still have a choice.

1020
01:44:15,141 --> 01:44:17,541
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?

1021
01:44:23,734 --> 01:44:25,174
Six years ago, Baltimore...

1022
01:44:25,402 --> 01:44:29,042
...you grabbed a kid at Francis
public pool on the West End.

1023
01:44:29,448 --> 01:44:33,568
Did I? I don't remember
anything about that place.

1024
01:44:37,832 --> 01:44:39,592
Who am I? Who am I?

1025
01:44:39,834 --> 01:44:41,754
Do you know who I am?

1026
01:44:42,003 --> 01:44:45,403
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!

1027
01:44:47,592 --> 01:44:48,592
Sean!

1028
01:44:49,511 --> 01:44:52,471
I told him I was a policeman
and needed his help.

1029
01:44:52,764 --> 01:44:57,604
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song.
I bought him a pretzel.

1030
01:44:57,978 --> 01:45:00,018
He was happy. He was happy.

1031
01:45:00,522 --> 01:45:03,322
Is he alive?
He's alive. Where have you got him?

1032
01:45:03,609 --> 01:45:06,809
Is he all right?
Tell me, you fuck, where is he?!

1033
01:45:07,113 --> 01:45:10,993
I put him in a barrel.
I sunk him in the bay.

1034
01:45:11,325 --> 01:45:14,325
He floated back up. I took him out.

1035
01:45:14,662 --> 01:45:17,702
I was gentle. I was gentle.

1036
01:45:18,833 --> 01:45:20,553
I was gentle.

1037
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:26,790
I'm sorry.

1038
01:45:27,050 --> 01:45:28,170
I'm sorry.

1039
01:45:28,427 --> 01:45:29,587
I'm sorry.

1040
01:45:29,803 --> 01:45:30,923
I'm sorry.

1041
01:45:31,180 --> 01:45:33,580
I'm so very sorry.

1042
01:45:35,934 --> 01:45:38,254
How could you do that to my...?

1043
01:46:10,804 --> 01:46:12,964
You can choose.

1044
01:46:16,685 --> 01:46:18,325
You can choose.

1045
01:46:37,123 --> 01:46:39,723
You have the right to remain silent.

1046
01:46:40,126 --> 01:46:44,606
Anything you say or do can be used
against you in a court of law.

1047
01:46:45,465 --> 01:46:47,865
You have the right to an attorney...

1048
01:46:48,177 --> 01:46:52,377
...now and during any
further questioning.

1049
01:46:52,765 --> 01:46:55,485
If you can't afford an attorney...

1050
01:46:57,770 --> 01:46:59,730
...we will appoint one.

1051
01:47:01,607 --> 01:47:04,247
Do you understand these rights?

1052
01:47:05,320 --> 01:47:07,440
You're not gonna kill me?

1053
01:47:10,324 --> 01:47:14,444
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?

1054
01:47:17,499 --> 01:47:21,379
If you don't go through with this,
my family gets nothing.

1055
01:47:21,712 --> 01:47:25,872
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.

1056
01:47:27,301 --> 01:47:29,501
He? Who's he?

1057
01:47:29,762 --> 01:47:32,522
I don't know.
He called me in my cell.

1058
01:47:32,807 --> 01:47:36,927
He told me I'd be released if I went
along, and my family would be cared for.

1059
01:47:37,270 --> 01:47:38,870
If you did what?

1060
01:47:39,105 --> 01:47:40,425
If you did what?

1061
01:47:42,149 --> 01:47:45,509
If I acted like I killed your kid.
Okay?

1062
01:47:47,405 --> 01:47:49,445
If you killed my kid?

1063
01:47:49,700 --> 01:47:53,340
Look, you don't kill me,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1064
01:47:54,121 --> 01:47:56,321
What about the pictures?

1065
01:47:57,124 --> 01:48:00,924
They're fake. He gave them to me.

1066
01:48:01,462 --> 01:48:03,822
Now, listen to me. You...

1067
01:48:04,131 --> 01:48:07,051
You tell me:
Who was it that set this up?

1068
01:48:08,385 --> 01:48:10,265
I don't know.

1069
01:48:10,680 --> 01:48:12,680
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again:

1070
01:48:12,932 --> 01:48:16,012
- Who put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.

1071
01:48:16,310 --> 01:48:18,070
I tell you who,
and my family gets nothing.

1072
01:48:18,313 --> 01:48:20,433
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.

1073
01:48:20,690 --> 01:48:22,930
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.

1074
01:48:23,192 --> 01:48:26,232
- Kill me.
- Leo, let go of the gun.

1075
01:48:26,530 --> 01:48:28,850
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1076
01:48:31,117 --> 01:48:35,037
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.

1077
01:48:36,540 --> 01:48:38,540
You're not gonna kill me.

1078
01:48:39,251 --> 01:48:41,611
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a sec...!

1079
01:48:55,810 --> 01:48:57,690
- Did you see it?
- Stay back!

1080
01:48:57,937 --> 01:49:00,137
What's happening down there?

1081
01:49:01,275 --> 01:49:02,795
Murder!

1082
01:49:03,152 --> 01:49:05,072
Murder!

1083
01:49:06,947 --> 01:49:08,347
Doesn't make sense.

1084
01:49:08,574 --> 01:49:12,494
If you were a child killer,
would you leave these photos out?

1085
01:49:12,828 --> 01:49:14,828
Anderton might have found them.

1086
01:49:15,080 --> 01:49:17,880
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent.

1087
01:49:18,167 --> 01:49:22,167
This will be your first murder scene?
I worked homicide before federal.

1088
01:49:22,505 --> 01:49:24,465
This is an orgy of evidence.

1089
01:49:24,716 --> 01:49:28,596
- Know how many orgies I had as a cop?
- How many?

1090
01:49:28,928 --> 01:49:30,208
None.

1091
01:49:35,394 --> 01:49:37,234
This was all arranged.

1092
01:49:37,479 --> 01:49:42,399
Today we saw the first murder in the
six years of the Precrime experiment.

1093
01:49:42,776 --> 01:49:45,336
Sadly enough, this failure was human.

1094
01:49:45,612 --> 01:49:48,812
The protection team
simply didn't get there in time.

1095
01:49:49,116 --> 01:49:53,956
But the murder itself happened exactly
as the Pre-Cogs predicted it would.

1096
01:49:54,330 --> 01:49:58,130
Today's event put a human face
on the Precrime system.

1097
01:49:58,459 --> 01:50:02,659
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

1098
01:50:04,966 --> 01:50:06,566
Lamar?

1099
01:50:13,767 --> 01:50:15,767
- What?
- There's something wrong.

1100
01:50:16,061 --> 01:50:19,981
We're chasing the wrong man.
I don 't wanna say over the phone.

1101
01:50:20,315 --> 01:50:21,995
Meet me at Anderton 's.

1102
01:50:22,234 --> 01:50:25,274
We recovered that
from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1103
01:50:30,952 --> 01:50:34,352
I remember when I gave this
to him, back in Baltimore.

1104
01:50:35,831 --> 01:50:37,431
Please, sir.

1105
01:50:40,420 --> 01:50:41,780
Tell me what you have.

1106
01:50:46,885 --> 01:50:50,245
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

1107
01:50:51,807 --> 01:50:55,647
John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?

1108
01:50:55,978 --> 01:50:58,898
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

1109
01:50:59,189 --> 01:51:01,389
Agatha's stream was missing.

1110
01:51:03,027 --> 01:51:05,467
This one is from the Cyber Parlor.

1111
01:51:05,737 --> 01:51:10,657
Anderton downloaded this directly
from Agatha. Rufus Riley recorded it.

1112
01:51:13,412 --> 01:51:17,052
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.

1113
01:51:18,877 --> 01:51:23,237
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the ripples.

1114
01:51:23,757 --> 01:51:26,517
Moving away from shore.

1115
01:51:27,886 --> 01:51:32,526
Now the second image, the one from
Containment that Art and Dash saw.

1116
01:51:33,058 --> 01:51:34,858
Watch the water.

1117
01:51:36,145 --> 01:51:40,985
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.

1118
01:51:42,401 --> 01:51:45,761
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

1119
01:51:46,071 --> 01:51:49,551
Anderton was watching this
right before he was tagged.

1120
01:51:49,867 --> 01:51:52,747
He told me about
the missing data stream.

1121
01:51:53,038 --> 01:51:56,758
- He was concerned you might find it.
- He was right. I did.

1122
01:51:57,083 --> 01:51:58,683
It was inside of Agatha.

1123
01:51:58,919 --> 01:52:03,799
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

1124
01:52:04,174 --> 01:52:08,214
Danny, just tell me
what you're thinking.

1125
01:52:08,596 --> 01:52:11,436
I'm thinking someone
got away with murder.

1126
01:52:12,224 --> 01:52:13,344
How?

1127
01:52:13,767 --> 01:52:18,127
Jad told me that sometimes the Pre-Cogs
see the same murder more than once.

1128
01:52:18,480 --> 01:52:22,200
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it Pre-Cog deja vu.

1129
01:52:22,527 --> 01:52:25,967
We teach the techs to identify
and disregard them.

1130
01:52:26,572 --> 01:52:31,692
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

1131
01:52:32,078 --> 01:52:36,638
What if he was looking at a completely
different murder altogether?

1132
01:52:37,000 --> 01:52:38,560
I don't understand.

1133
01:52:38,919 --> 01:52:41,119
All you'd have to do is hire someone
to kill Anne Lively...

1134
01:52:41,380 --> 01:52:44,900
...like a drifter, a neuroin addict,
someone with nothing to lose.

1135
01:52:45,217 --> 01:52:48,017
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place...

1136
01:52:48,304 --> 01:52:53,024
...haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else...

1137
01:52:53,392 --> 01:52:57,312
...having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes...

1138
01:52:57,647 --> 01:53:01,287
...commits the murder
in exactly the same way.

1139
01:53:01,609 --> 01:53:06,769
Technician takes a look, thinks he's
looking at an echo, erases it.

1140
01:53:11,495 --> 01:53:16,135
It'd have to be someone with access
to the previsions in the first place.

1141
01:53:16,499 --> 01:53:18,499
Someone fairly high-up.

1142
01:53:20,754 --> 01:53:22,754
Do you know what I hear?

1143
01:53:24,508 --> 01:53:27,748
Nothing.
No footsteps up the stairs.

1144
01:53:28,054 --> 01:53:32,174
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.

1145
01:53:32,516 --> 01:53:33,916
Do you know why?

1146
01:53:34,143 --> 01:53:37,423
Because right now,
the Pre-Cogs can't see a thing.

1147
01:54:02,465 --> 01:54:05,705
Can you see? It's beautiful.

1148
01:54:06,260 --> 01:54:09,580
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.

1149
01:54:17,063 --> 01:54:18,943
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.

1150
01:54:19,191 --> 01:54:21,631
- Yes, Lara.
- You have to help him.

1151
01:54:22,902 --> 01:54:23,942
Is he there?

1152
01:54:26,490 --> 01:54:28,010
Is the Pre-Cog with him?

1153
01:54:32,079 --> 01:54:34,559
Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1154
01:54:34,832 --> 01:54:38,272
Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.

1155
01:54:39,754 --> 01:54:41,914
I won't say a word.

1156
01:54:42,882 --> 01:54:46,602
You just don't let John leave,
all right?

1157
01:54:48,388 --> 01:54:50,028
He's no killer, Lamar.

1158
01:54:50,724 --> 01:54:51,884
I know.

1159
01:55:03,653 --> 01:55:05,093
It's cold.

1160
01:55:10,160 --> 01:55:13,040
Lara, this is Agatha.

1161
01:55:18,294 --> 01:55:23,414
You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?

1162
01:55:26,469 --> 01:55:31,669
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

1163
01:55:34,352 --> 01:55:36,592
I gotta sit down.

1164
01:55:37,481 --> 01:55:39,561
I gotta figure this out.

1165
01:55:40,150 --> 01:55:42,310
I gotta figure this out.

1166
01:56:21,861 --> 01:56:23,701
They used Sean.

1167
01:56:25,531 --> 01:56:28,251
They wanted me to think
Crow killed him.

1168
01:56:29,536 --> 01:56:31,016
But he didn't.

1169
01:56:32,663 --> 01:56:34,023
He didn't.

1170
01:56:35,834 --> 01:56:38,274
Why would they set you up?

1171
01:56:45,969 --> 01:56:48,769
Because I found out about her.

1172
01:56:49,806 --> 01:56:51,526
About who?

1173
01:56:51,809 --> 01:56:55,449
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?

1174
01:56:56,814 --> 01:56:58,814
Anne Lively.

1175
01:57:01,402 --> 01:57:02,842
Agatha.

1176
01:57:07,617 --> 01:57:10,617
Dr. Hineman once said,
"The dead don't die...

1177
01:57:10,912 --> 01:57:12,912
...they look on and help. "

1178
01:57:13,748 --> 01:57:15,908
Remember that, John.

1179
01:57:17,085 --> 01:57:18,205
Agatha.

1180
01:57:18,420 --> 01:57:19,980
Sean.

1181
01:57:24,176 --> 01:57:26,536
He's on the beach now...

1182
01:57:27,262 --> 01:57:29,422
...toe in the water.

1183
01:57:30,599 --> 01:57:33,319
He's asking you to come in with him.

1184
01:57:34,103 --> 01:57:37,343
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

1185
01:57:39,275 --> 01:57:42,035
There's so much love in this house.

1186
01:57:47,158 --> 01:57:48,998
He's 10 years old.

1187
01:57:51,496 --> 01:57:54,056
He's surrounded by animals.

1188
01:57:55,417 --> 01:57:57,617
He wants to be a vet.

1189
01:57:59,547 --> 01:58:04,107
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

1190
01:58:05,803 --> 01:58:07,563
He's in high school.

1191
01:58:08,138 --> 01:58:10,858
He likes to run, like his father.

1192
01:58:11,475 --> 01:58:14,675
He runs the two-mile
and the long relay.

1193
01:58:16,146 --> 01:58:17,826
He's 23.

1194
01:58:19,317 --> 01:58:21,477
He's at a university.

1195
01:58:22,028 --> 01:58:25,108
He makes love
to a pretty girl named Claire.

1196
01:58:25,406 --> 01:58:27,766
He asks her to be his wife.

1197
01:58:28,493 --> 01:58:31,973
He calls here and tells Lara,
who cries.

1198
01:58:33,748 --> 01:58:35,668
He still runs...

1199
01:58:35,959 --> 01:58:40,039
...across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

1200
01:58:40,422 --> 01:58:44,782
Oh, God. He's running so fast,
just like his daddy.

1201
01:58:45,553 --> 01:58:49,593
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.

1202
01:58:51,225 --> 01:58:55,625
But he's only 6 years old,
and he can't do it.

1203
01:58:56,314 --> 01:58:58,554
And the other man is so fast.

1204
01:59:02,487 --> 01:59:05,127
There was so much love in this house.

1205
01:59:06,491 --> 01:59:08,731
I want him back so bad.

1206
01:59:11,330 --> 01:59:13,050
So did she.

1207
01:59:13,832 --> 01:59:15,472
Can't you see?

1208
01:59:19,380 --> 01:59:22,460
She just wanted her little girl back.

1209
01:59:24,760 --> 01:59:26,920
But it was too late.

1210
01:59:28,681 --> 01:59:31,081
Her little girl was already gone.

1211
01:59:31,934 --> 01:59:33,454
She's still alive.

1212
01:59:35,146 --> 01:59:36,946
She didn't die.

1213
01:59:37,440 --> 01:59:39,280
But she's not alive.

1214
01:59:41,194 --> 01:59:42,634
Agatha?

1215
01:59:45,324 --> 01:59:46,644
Just tell me...

1216
01:59:47,284 --> 01:59:49,284
...who killed your mother?

1217
01:59:50,037 --> 01:59:52,077
Who killed Anne Lively?

1218
01:59:53,790 --> 01:59:58,510
I'm sorry, John,
but you're gonna have to run again.

1219
01:59:59,505 --> 02:00:01,585
- What?
- Run!

1220
02:00:18,524 --> 02:00:20,124
I love you.

1221
02:00:21,069 --> 02:00:23,749
- It's okay.
- You'll be fine with them.

1222
02:00:24,031 --> 02:00:26,711
- No! No!
- Stay with me. Stay with me.

1223
02:00:26,992 --> 02:00:29,352
- John, no.
- Don't talk.

1224
02:00:46,930 --> 02:00:48,210
John Anderton.

1225
02:00:49,558 --> 02:00:52,638
By mandate of the D.C.
Precrime Division...

1226
02:00:52,936 --> 02:00:57,896
...I'm placing you under arrest for the
murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1227
02:01:01,278 --> 02:01:02,838
That's it.

1228
02:01:03,322 --> 02:01:05,002
That's my girl.

1229
02:01:06,908 --> 02:01:09,108
I was so worried about you.

1230
02:01:13,249 --> 02:01:14,969
Did he hurt you?

1231
02:01:18,087 --> 02:01:19,647
I missed you so much.

1232
02:01:19,881 --> 02:01:22,041
It's okay. Wally's here.

1233
02:01:22,843 --> 02:01:24,203
Wally's here.

1234
02:01:29,433 --> 02:01:32,713
You're a part of my flock now, John.

1235
02:01:33,061 --> 02:01:34,501
Welcome.

1236
02:01:35,522 --> 02:01:39,882
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions...

1237
02:01:40,235 --> 02:01:43,195
...that your life flashes
before your eyes...

1238
02:01:43,489 --> 02:01:46,809
...that all your dreams come true.

1239
02:02:03,718 --> 02:02:05,918
This is all my fault.

1240
02:02:07,013 --> 02:02:09,493
There was nothing anyone could do.

1241
02:02:14,021 --> 02:02:16,701
I thought you might want
to have those.

1242
02:02:22,613 --> 02:02:27,493
I haven't worn this in years. I wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

1243
02:02:27,869 --> 02:02:29,149
You look great.

1244
02:02:29,370 --> 02:02:33,450
I knew he was having trouble
for some time, yet I did nothing.

1245
02:02:33,792 --> 02:02:37,192
- The guy from USA Today is here.
- Tell him not now.

1246
02:02:37,503 --> 02:02:40,823
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!

1247
02:02:43,510 --> 02:02:46,910
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.

1248
02:02:47,264 --> 02:02:52,784
But this incident with John made me
realize the fragility of all this.

1249
02:02:53,562 --> 02:02:56,762
This is John's legacy
as much as it is my own.

1250
02:02:57,692 --> 02:03:01,012
Now I have an obligation
to protect that.

1251
02:03:01,695 --> 02:03:05,095
Lara, I know how difficult
this is for you.

1252
02:03:05,408 --> 02:03:08,648
But maybe you can find
some closure in the fact...

1253
02:03:08,953 --> 02:03:13,233
...that John finally found
the man who killed your son.

1254
02:03:16,253 --> 02:03:17,533
Who's Anne Lively?

1255
02:03:20,424 --> 02:03:22,784
- Who?
- Anne Lively.

1256
02:03:23,344 --> 02:03:27,104
John was talking about her
right before they took him.

1257
02:03:27,431 --> 02:03:29,511
I don't know who that is.

1258
02:03:30,768 --> 02:03:35,768
John said something about him being
set up because he found out about her.

1259
02:03:36,148 --> 02:03:40,908
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.

1260
02:03:41,278 --> 02:03:45,638
And Witwer? He was killed with
John's gun inside John's apartment.

1261
02:03:45,992 --> 02:03:50,032
Do you know the reason why
John came here to work for you?

1262
02:03:50,371 --> 02:03:51,691
- Sean.
- Yes.

1263
02:03:52,540 --> 02:03:55,700
He came here to work for you
because he thought...

1264
02:03:56,003 --> 02:04:00,443
...if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening...

1265
02:04:01,300 --> 02:04:04,380
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

1266
02:04:04,679 --> 02:04:09,239
Sir, they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes.

1267
02:04:09,600 --> 02:04:10,720
Lara...

1268
02:04:11,227 --> 02:04:13,987
...John was the best cop I ever knew...

1269
02:04:14,313 --> 02:04:17,033
...and, in some ways,
also the best man.

1270
02:04:17,316 --> 02:04:19,676
But the scars he carried around...

1271
02:04:19,945 --> 02:04:25,105
Well, I know he'd want us to honor
the good things we remember about him.

1272
02:04:25,492 --> 02:04:30,932
And I also know why he married you:
You're as stubborn as he is.

1273
02:04:31,331 --> 02:04:35,531
- Lamar...
- Do you know how to tie one of these?

1274
02:04:35,878 --> 02:04:40,118
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, as you see.

1275
02:04:48,140 --> 02:04:50,820
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1276
02:04:51,102 --> 02:04:55,222
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

1277
02:04:55,565 --> 02:04:59,085
And I'll have Gideon
run the Containment files...

1278
02:04:59,402 --> 02:05:02,322
...see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of...

1279
02:05:02,613 --> 02:05:05,293
What did you say her name was?

1280
02:05:07,494 --> 02:05:09,134
Anne Lively.

1281
02:05:09,830 --> 02:05:12,270
But I never said she drowned.

1282
02:05:32,228 --> 02:05:36,868
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.

1283
02:05:41,739 --> 02:05:44,059
We'll talk about this later.

1284
02:05:44,908 --> 02:05:49,308
Perhaps tomorrow,
I'll come by the cottage.

1285
02:06:26,243 --> 02:06:28,683
I'd like a word with my husband.

1286
02:06:29,497 --> 02:06:32,417
You're not authorized.

1287
02:06:32,750 --> 02:06:35,350
How did you get in here?

1288
02:06:44,137 --> 02:06:45,417
Thank you.

1289
02:06:45,639 --> 02:06:50,759
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess,
director of the new National Precrime.

1290
02:06:53,605 --> 02:06:57,325
On behalf of your staff,
we present you with this.

1291
02:06:57,651 --> 02:07:01,331
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.

1292
02:07:02,615 --> 02:07:04,055
How did you get this?

1293
02:07:04,283 --> 02:07:07,283
I padded your expense account
for six months.

1294
02:07:09,831 --> 02:07:13,511
Revolvers like this one
were given to generals...

1295
02:07:13,834 --> 02:07:16,874
...at the end of the Civil War
by their troops.

1296
02:07:17,172 --> 02:07:20,972
The cylinders were loaded
with five gold-plated bullets...

1297
02:07:21,300 --> 02:07:24,460
...to symbolize the end
of the destruction and death...

1298
02:07:24,763 --> 02:07:27,163
...that had ripped the country apart
for five years.

1299
02:07:27,433 --> 02:07:30,793
Ladies and gentlemen,
with Precrime going national...

1300
02:07:31,103 --> 02:07:34,983
...maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us...

1301
02:07:35,316 --> 02:07:38,516
...will have to discharge
another firearm ever again.

1302
02:07:39,987 --> 02:07:44,507
Now enjoy yourselves.
Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.

1303
02:07:47,578 --> 02:07:51,698
Does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends?

1304
02:07:54,627 --> 02:07:55,827
Hello.

1305
02:07:56,045 --> 02:07:58,445
Yes. Right away.

1306
02:07:58,840 --> 02:08:01,840
- Excuse me, so sorry.
- Excuse me.

1307
02:08:02,177 --> 02:08:03,497
- Sir?
- Yes.

1308
02:08:03,720 --> 02:08:07,280
Sir, you have an emergency call
on your private line.

1309
02:08:08,517 --> 02:08:10,157
Yes, this is Burgess.

1310
02:08:10,393 --> 02:08:14,793
Hello, Lamar. I just wanted
to congratulate you. You did it.

1311
02:08:15,149 --> 02:08:17,549
You created a world without murder.

1312
02:08:17,818 --> 02:08:20,858
Everyone wants your name on a hat.
Can you sign these?

1313
02:08:21,155 --> 02:08:23,515
All you had to do was kill someone
to do it.

1314
02:08:28,371 --> 02:08:29,371
A-room. Jad.

1315
02:08:30,415 --> 02:08:33,615
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

1316
02:08:33,960 --> 02:08:38,360
- What are you talking about?
- Agatha 's mother, Anne Lively.

1317
02:08:38,715 --> 02:08:42,875
Just a junkie who had a kid once
and had to give her up, but surprise!

1318
02:08:43,220 --> 02:08:46,060
She cleaned herself up,
and she wanted her daughter back.

1319
02:08:46,348 --> 02:08:48,228
She wanted Agatha.

1320
02:08:50,811 --> 02:08:55,051
Jad, you getting this? It's from the
female only. No time or incident data.

1321
02:08:55,399 --> 02:08:57,759
It isn't the future.
It already happened.

1322
02:08:58,028 --> 02:09:01,628
And the problem was, without Agatha,
there was no Precrime.

1323
02:09:01,948 --> 02:09:06,548
She's the strongest of the three.
Without Agatha, you had nothing.

1324
02:09:06,911 --> 02:09:12,111
You wouldn't be where you are now,
standing there, signing autographs.

1325
02:09:20,175 --> 02:09:23,455
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing with that?

1326
02:09:23,762 --> 02:09:27,202
- What you up to, big man?
- Think before you send that.

1327
02:09:27,516 --> 02:09:28,516
Slow down.

1328
02:09:49,164 --> 02:09:53,684
Now you had to get rid of Anne Lively,
which presented a problem:

1329
02:09:54,044 --> 02:09:57,564
How can you kill her
without the Pre-Cogs seeing it?

1330
02:09:57,881 --> 02:10:01,961
Simple. Use a system
you control against her.

1331
02:10:02,345 --> 02:10:07,345
You hired someone to kill her, knowing
the Pre-Cogs would see that murder.

1332
02:10:07,725 --> 02:10:11,125
You lured Anne Lively
out to the lake...

1333
02:10:11,437 --> 02:10:15,277
...with the promise of reuniting her
with her daughter.

1334
02:10:59,947 --> 02:11:01,867
Where's my daughter?

1335
02:11:09,206 --> 02:11:10,366
Where?

1336
02:11:12,459 --> 02:11:13,699
Run!

1337
02:11:17,172 --> 02:11:18,252
Run!

1338
02:11:29,936 --> 02:11:33,136
When you were all alone,
you killed her yourself...

1339
02:11:33,439 --> 02:11:37,239
...in the same way the Pre-Cogs
predicted your John Doe would kill her.

1340
02:11:37,569 --> 02:11:40,369
You made the real murder
look like an echo...

1341
02:11:40,655 --> 02:11:45,215
...knowing the tech would do what
he was trained to do: Disregard it.

1342
02:11:51,166 --> 02:11:55,446
Anne Lively became
just another missing person.

1343
02:11:56,256 --> 02:11:59,296
So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?

1344
02:12:00,176 --> 02:12:02,016
What are you gonna do?

1345
02:12:13,231 --> 02:12:14,511
We got a Red Ball!

1346
02:12:20,740 --> 02:12:23,540
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1347
02:12:23,826 --> 02:12:26,586
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1348
02:12:26,871 --> 02:12:31,271
Think of all the lives she will save.
She could have saved Sean.

1349
02:12:31,625 --> 02:12:34,105
Don't you ever say his name!

1350
02:12:36,423 --> 02:12:39,463
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1351
02:12:39,759 --> 02:12:42,639
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1352
02:12:42,929 --> 02:12:45,809
You knew that would
drive me to murder.

1353
02:12:46,099 --> 02:12:49,379
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

1354
02:12:49,686 --> 02:12:51,606
- How are you gonna...?
- Shut me up?

1355
02:12:51,855 --> 02:12:54,095
Forgive me, John.

1356
02:13:02,533 --> 02:13:04,253
Forgive me, John.

1357
02:13:15,922 --> 02:13:17,202
Lamar.

1358
02:13:17,674 --> 02:13:19,034
It's over.

1359
02:13:19,759 --> 02:13:24,839
The question you have to ask is,
what are you gonna do now?

1360
02:13:38,237 --> 02:13:41,157
No doubt the Pre-Cogs have
already seen this.

1361
02:13:41,449 --> 02:13:43,049
No doubt.

1362
02:13:44,118 --> 02:13:46,358
You see the dilemma, don't you?

1363
02:13:47,121 --> 02:13:51,361
If you don't kill me, Pre-Cogs were
wrong and Precrime is over.

1364
02:13:52,585 --> 02:13:55,985
If you do kill me, you go away...

1365
02:13:56,632 --> 02:14:00,912
...but it proves the system works.
Pre-Cogs were right.

1366
02:14:07,184 --> 02:14:10,424
So, what are you gonna do now?

1367
02:14:11,856 --> 02:14:13,776
What's it worth?

1368
02:14:14,651 --> 02:14:16,891
Just one more murder.

1369
02:14:19,822 --> 02:14:24,742
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but
people will still believe in Precrime.

1370
02:14:25,119 --> 02:14:28,999
All you have to do is kill me,
like they said you would.

1371
02:14:32,502 --> 02:14:34,022
Except...

1372
02:14:34,963 --> 02:14:37,323
...you know your own future...

1373
02:14:37,633 --> 02:14:41,113
...which means you can change it
if you want to.

1374
02:14:42,304 --> 02:14:45,224
You still have a choice, Lamar.

1375
02:14:45,808 --> 02:14:47,608
Like I did.

1376
02:14:52,356 --> 02:14:54,996
Yes, I have a choice...

1377
02:14:56,402 --> 02:14:58,322
...and I made it.

1378
02:14:59,322 --> 02:15:01,242
Forgive me, John.

1379
02:15:02,909 --> 02:15:04,629
Forgive me.

1380
02:15:09,958 --> 02:15:11,598
Forgive me, my boy.

1381
02:15:30,312 --> 02:15:31,832
Lamar!

1382
02:15:42,863 --> 02:15:47,716
In 2054, the six-year Precrime
experiment was abandoned.

1383
02:15:55,339 --> 02:15:58,784
All prisoners were unconditionally
pardoned and released...

1384
02:15:58,784 --> 02:16:03,290
...although police departments
kept watch on many of them for years.

1385
02:16:50,763 --> 02:16:53,395
Agatha and the twins...

1386
02:16:53,395 --> 02:16:56,564
...were transferred
to an undisclosed location...

1387
02:16:57,820 --> 02:17:00,755
...a place where they could
find relief from their gifts...

1388
02:17:01,552 --> 02:17:05,540
...a place where they could
live out their lives in peace.
