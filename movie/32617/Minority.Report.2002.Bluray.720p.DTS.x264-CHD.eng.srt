1
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,820
You know how blind I am without them.

2
00:01:36,086 --> 00:01:37,966
Howard, don't cry.

3
00:01:59,069 --> 00:02:01,909
Murder.

4
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,930
- Good luck, John.
- Any contractions?

5
00:02:37,192 --> 00:02:38,872
Only the ones you give me.

6
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:56,472
- What's coming?
- Red Ball, double homicide.

7
00:02:56,754 --> 00:02:59,834
One male, one female.
Killer's male, white, 40s.

8
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:04,772
Agatha nailed the time at 8:04 a.m.
The twins are a little fuzzy on that.

9
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:08,578
Location's still uncertain.
Remote witnesses are plugged in.

10
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,531
This will be case number 1108.

11
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:17,738
Morning, detectives.

12
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:22,065
Case number 1108,
previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...

13
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:24,204
...recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's Q-stacks.

14
00:03:24,449 --> 00:03:28,849
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

15
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:30,205
Good morning.

16
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:33,894
Will the witness preview and validate
1108 at this time?

17
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,090
Affirmative. I will validate.

18
00:03:36,337 --> 00:03:37,737
Go get them.

19
00:03:38,047 --> 00:03:40,727
- Standby.
- Time of murder: 8:04 a.m.

20
00:03:41,008 --> 00:03:45,208
That is 24 minutes, 13 seconds
from now. This is a Red Ball.

21
00:04:11,124 --> 00:04:13,404
You know how blind I am without them.

22
00:04:15,294 --> 00:04:17,934
All right, Howard Marks,
where are you?

23
00:04:18,882 --> 00:04:22,402
Howard? Howard, breakfast.

24
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:40,395
Four score and seven years ago...

25
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,821
- He looked familiar.
- Who?

26
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:47,037
A man standing in the park
across the street.

27
00:04:47,328 --> 00:04:49,528
- Seen him before.
- How can you tell?

28
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,629
You're blind without your glasses.
Where are your glasses?

29
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,637
- In the bedroom.
- You're running out of time.

30
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:57,804
- You know how blind I am...

31
00:05:11,687 --> 00:05:15,927
I show eight Howard Markses in the
District. Sorting by race and age.

32
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:20,915
Run their license and registration.
See if I can capture an address here.

33
00:05:23,116 --> 00:05:25,396
I was thinking I'd stay home today.

34
00:05:25,659 --> 00:05:28,499
- What about your meeting?
- I've been working too much.

35
00:05:28,788 --> 00:05:31,588
- Can you grab that?
- It's unclear.

36
00:05:33,709 --> 00:05:37,069
- Six licenses. Where do you want them?
- Over here, please.

37
00:05:57,943 --> 00:06:00,903
You know how blind I am without them.

38
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:08,243
Got him in the Foxhall.
4421 Gainsborough.

39
00:06:08,579 --> 00:06:11,659
Send DCPD. Set up a perimeter.
Tell them we're en route.

40
00:06:11,958 --> 00:06:15,678
I was thinking maybe I'd play hooky,
stay home today.

41
00:06:16,338 --> 00:06:19,978
- "We've come to dedicate a portion..."
- What do you think?

42
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:23,341
- What about your meeting?
- I'll reschedule.

43
00:06:23,637 --> 00:06:26,037
I've been working too much anyway.

44
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:30,181
- "But in a larger s..." Good.
- We could have lunch together.

45
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:32,757
- What do you say?
- "We cannot consecrate...

46
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:35,903
- I would love to.
- "The brave men, living and dead...

47
00:06:36,192 --> 00:06:38,872
I have an open house
at the Ressler place.

48
00:06:39,153 --> 00:06:43,393
- Have consecrated, far above our
poor power to add or detract. "

49
00:06:43,867 --> 00:06:46,387
I guess that's why you look so nice.

50
00:06:48,162 --> 00:06:52,202
Chief! We got a problem
with our location.

51
00:06:56,588 --> 00:06:58,468
- It's no longer there.
- Shit!

52
00:06:58,715 --> 00:07:00,635
- Time frame?
- Thirteen minutes.

53
00:07:00,885 --> 00:07:02,805
Investigator from the fed's here.

54
00:07:03,053 --> 00:07:05,413
I don't need some twink
from the fed poking around.

55
00:07:05,681 --> 00:07:07,161
I wrote it on your calendar.

56
00:07:07,391 --> 00:07:09,711
See if the neighbors knew
where they went.

57
00:07:09,978 --> 00:07:11,818
- Check all relations.
- Checking.

58
00:07:12,062 --> 00:07:16,222
Just get him some coffee,
tell him how I save your ass every day.

59
00:07:16,651 --> 00:07:18,011
I got coffee, thanks.

60
00:07:18,236 --> 00:07:20,796
Danny Witwer,
the twink from the fed.

61
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:22,832
Oops. Gum?

62
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:25,474
I'll give you the full tour
some other time.

63
00:07:25,744 --> 00:07:29,544
They moved two weeks ago. Nobody
knows where. Still searching for family.

64
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:31,513
Time horizon, 12 minutes.

65
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:33,834
He's scrubbing the image, looking for...

66
00:07:34,003 --> 00:07:36,283
...clues as to where
the murder will happen.

67
00:07:36,546 --> 00:07:41,506
Original running bond brick pattern,
Georgian details. Brick was repointed.

68
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:47,482
And that this nation, under God,
shall not perish from the earth.

69
00:07:47,934 --> 00:07:50,454
Victims are pronounced here,
killers here.

70
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:55,009
Beyond that, all we have to run on
are the images that they produce.

71
00:08:05,452 --> 00:08:08,172
- Show a cop on horseback.
- Near the Capitol?

72
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:11,015
- No Maglev system.
- The Mall?

73
00:08:12,042 --> 00:08:13,242
Georgetown.

74
00:08:13,502 --> 00:08:16,542
The Pre-Cogs can see a murder
four days out. Why the late call?

75
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:21,118
A Red Ball. Crimes of passion have no
premeditation, so they show up late.

76
00:08:21,469 --> 00:08:25,829
Most of our scrambles are flash events.
We rarely see premeditation anymore.

77
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:27,942
People have gotten the message.

78
00:08:28,184 --> 00:08:32,424
I show a match with Dwight Kingsley,
18th-century architect.

79
00:08:32,772 --> 00:08:37,012
- He did two dozen houses in D.C.
- Time horizon, 10 minutes.

80
00:08:42,532 --> 00:08:44,132
Look at this kid.

81
00:08:44,743 --> 00:08:47,303
In this one,
he's on the left side of the man.

82
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,100
Yes. So?

83
00:08:49,331 --> 00:08:51,091
This one he's on the right.

84
00:09:08,268 --> 00:09:10,108
Merry-go-round.

85
00:09:10,729 --> 00:09:12,049
It's a park.

86
00:09:15,734 --> 00:09:19,014
There's only 16 of these old
merry-go-rounds left in the city.

87
00:09:19,321 --> 00:09:21,921
Two in Georgetown, one in
Barnaby Woods, the others in Woodley.

88
00:09:22,199 --> 00:09:24,719
It's gotta be Barnaby Woods.
Evanna, flight time?

89
00:09:24,994 --> 00:09:27,474
The way I drive?
Three minutes after wheels up.

90
00:09:41,052 --> 00:09:42,452
- Clear.
- Clear.

91
00:10:02,574 --> 00:10:05,294
Time horizon, six minutes.

92
00:10:41,449 --> 00:10:43,449
Let's go to bed.

93
00:10:43,826 --> 00:10:45,706
Let's do it in here.

94
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:50,280
- But the bed is soft.
- I'm soft.

95
00:11:36,423 --> 00:11:37,783
Shit.

96
00:11:39,467 --> 00:11:40,827
Which one is it?

97
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:50,157
- Not the bed.
- Come on.

98
00:11:50,437 --> 00:11:52,637
I don't want to be on the bed.

99
00:11:56,151 --> 00:12:00,231
- We're catching up to the future.
- Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

100
00:12:00,907 --> 00:12:03,067
- Jad?
- Go ahead.

101
00:12:03,326 --> 00:12:06,006
- Did he close the front door?
- What?

102
00:12:06,287 --> 00:12:08,647
Did Marks close the front door?

103
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:18,200
Front door...

104
00:12:21,929 --> 00:12:24,289
I didn't wanna be on the bed.

105
00:12:28,769 --> 00:12:33,089
- Negative. The front door is open.
- Time horizon, 30 seconds.

106
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:43,180
I forgot my glasses.

107
00:12:43,452 --> 00:12:44,532
Howard.

108
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:58,543
You know how blind I am without them.

109
00:13:00,094 --> 00:13:01,854
Howard, don't cry.

110
00:13:02,304 --> 00:13:03,344
Marks!

111
00:13:22,492 --> 00:13:24,252
Look at me. Look at me.

112
00:13:29,249 --> 00:13:31,329
Positive for Howard Marks.

113
00:13:31,585 --> 00:13:34,705
By mandate of the District of Columbia
Precrime Division...

114
00:13:35,005 --> 00:13:39,045
...you're under arrest for the future
murder of Mrs. Marks and Mr. Dubin...

115
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,745
...that was to take place today
at 0800 hours and four minutes.

116
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:46,815
- I didn't do anything. Sarah?
- Give the man his hat.

117
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:51,303
Oh, God.
Don't put that halo on me. Sarah!

118
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:56,047
- Put your hand on your head.
- Help me! I wasn't gonna do anything!

119
00:13:56,403 --> 00:13:59,043
I'm Officer Scott with the
Precrime Trauma Response Unit.

120
00:13:59,322 --> 00:14:01,562
Sit here a minute and listen to me.

121
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:04,585
Your husband is being arrested
by Precrime.

122
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:07,590
Oh, God, Howard, no.

123
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:12,200
Howard, don't cry.
Howard, don't cry.

124
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:19,930
Please, don't cry.
Oh, God. Oh, God.

125
00:14:22,304 --> 00:14:24,704
I thought they stopped the murder.

126
00:14:25,266 --> 00:14:29,226
That's just an echo.
Pre-Cog deja vu, if you will.

127
00:14:29,563 --> 00:14:32,723
The really bad ones
the Pre-Cogs see over and over again.

128
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:35,184
Wally, erase the incoming.

129
00:14:50,167 --> 00:14:52,967
Imagine a world without murder.

130
00:14:54,005 --> 00:14:55,965
- I lost my best friend.
- I lost my aunt.

131
00:14:56,257 --> 00:14:58,257
- I lost my dad.
- I lost my wife.

132
00:14:58,593 --> 00:15:03,033
Just six years ago, the homicide rate
had reached epidemic proportions.

133
00:15:03,556 --> 00:15:06,396
It seemed that only a miracle
could stop the bloodshed.

134
00:15:06,726 --> 00:15:10,766
But instead of one miracle, we
were given three: The Pre-Cognitives.

135
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:13,827
Within just one month
under the Precrime program...

136
00:15:14,151 --> 00:15:17,591
...the murder rate in the District
of Columbia was reduced 90%% .

137
00:15:17,947 --> 00:15:19,987
- They were waiting for me.
- He was gonna rape me.

138
00:15:20,282 --> 00:15:22,042
- I was going to be stabbed.
- Right here.

139
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:26,644
Within a year, Precrime effectively
stopped murder in our nation 's capital.

140
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:29,120
In the six years of our experiment...

141
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:32,825
...there hasn't been a single murder.

142
00:15:33,087 --> 00:15:35,207
And now Precrime can work for you.

143
00:15:35,548 --> 00:15:38,308
We want to make certain
that every American...

144
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,595
...can bank on the infallibility
of the system.

145
00:15:42,055 --> 00:15:47,215
And to ensure that what keeps us safe
will also keep us free.

146
00:15:48,771 --> 00:15:50,731
- Precrime. It works.
- It works.

147
00:15:51,022 --> 00:15:52,342
- It works.
- It works.

148
00:15:52,566 --> 00:15:54,166
- It works.
- It works.

149
00:15:54,818 --> 00:15:57,098
Precrime. It works.

150
00:15:57,446 --> 00:16:02,206
On Tuesday, April 22, vote "yes"
on the National Precrime Initiative.

151
00:16:05,496 --> 00:16:08,696
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

152
00:16:14,047 --> 00:16:16,847
- Just need a little clarity.
- True that.

153
00:16:17,508 --> 00:16:22,108
You want the customary clarity or
the new and improved kind of clarity?

154
00:16:22,848 --> 00:16:24,128
Give me the new stuff.

155
00:16:24,766 --> 00:16:29,806
New and improved clarity.
Clarity, clarity. Yes, indeed.

156
00:16:30,564 --> 00:16:31,884
Come on. Come on.

157
00:16:32,149 --> 00:16:35,389
Don't bust my balls. You've only given
me four, and some of these are duds.

158
00:16:35,986 --> 00:16:37,466
Sweet dreams, chief.

159
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:42,932
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

160
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:45,522
I could use a little juice on my side.

161
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:47,989
What do you think you know?

162
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,889
It's like my daddy used to say:

163
00:16:51,669 --> 00:16:54,589
"In the land of the blind...

164
00:16:55,799 --> 00:16:59,999
...the one-eyed man is king. "

165
00:17:21,325 --> 00:17:22,645
I'm home.

166
00:17:31,252 --> 00:17:32,252
Overhead.

167
00:18:29,063 --> 00:18:30,063
Wall screen.

168
00:18:36,821 --> 00:18:39,061
- Sean.
- Hi, Daddy.

169
00:18:39,699 --> 00:18:41,899
Can you teach me how to run faster?

170
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,000
Because all the kids in my class
run faster than me.

171
00:18:47,624 --> 00:18:48,704
That's good.

172
00:18:48,959 --> 00:18:51,119
Keep your knees up.

173
00:18:51,962 --> 00:18:54,882
Like that. Like that.
High. High. Like that.

174
00:18:55,549 --> 00:18:58,709
- See, you're a natural runner.
- Gotta keep running.

175
00:18:59,052 --> 00:19:01,812
Yeah. Gotta keep running.

176
00:19:02,682 --> 00:19:04,202
Gotta keep running.

177
00:19:05,226 --> 00:19:09,386
- Will I be as fast as you someday?
- Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.

178
00:19:09,939 --> 00:19:13,339
- You're gonna beat everybody.
- I think you'll beat everyone someday.

179
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,812
- I gotta go. Bye.
- No, no, no. Wait, wait.

180
00:19:17,113 --> 00:19:19,793
- You gotta give me a kiss.
- Not on the lips.

181
00:19:20,492 --> 00:19:23,572
Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.

182
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,310
Yeah, all right. All right.

183
00:19:25,956 --> 00:19:27,276
I love you.

184
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,115
- I love you, Sean.
- I love you, Daddy.

185
00:20:06,373 --> 00:20:08,573
Reminds me of Rosarito Beach.

186
00:20:10,336 --> 00:20:11,576
Remember?

187
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,990
We had 20 dollars and...

188
00:20:15,675 --> 00:20:19,835
Waiting in that van so the sun
would shine on our vacation.

189
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:26,268
John. John. John,
put the camera down.

190
00:20:26,603 --> 00:20:31,563
Look, I'm all ready for bed.
What is this? No. Put it away.

191
00:20:31,942 --> 00:20:34,302
It's time to put the camera
to sleep...

192
00:20:34,570 --> 00:20:37,770
...and time to come
and take care of your wife.

193
00:20:40,367 --> 00:20:45,767
Why don 't you put the camera down
and come and watch the rain with me?

194
00:20:46,498 --> 00:20:50,098
No? I promise I'll make it
a memorable moment.

195
00:20:54,298 --> 00:20:57,658
Put the camera down
or you're not getting anything tonight.

196
00:21:39,388 --> 00:21:42,668
A gentleman at Justice
wants to take this away from us.

197
00:21:42,974 --> 00:21:45,654
In a week, people will vote
on whether or not...

198
00:21:45,936 --> 00:21:49,136
...what we've been doing has been
a noble-minded enterprise...

199
00:21:49,439 --> 00:21:52,679
...or a chance to change the way
this country fights crime.

200
00:21:53,068 --> 00:21:54,308
John...

201
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:59,146
...watch this Danny Witwer,
the observer from Justice.

202
00:21:59,492 --> 00:22:02,292
- I met him yesterday.
- Let him look around.

203
00:22:02,578 --> 00:22:04,778
Answer his questions,
but watch him.

204
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,759
If there's any problem,
make sure we know about it.

205
00:22:08,668 --> 00:22:12,228
When the Pre-Cogs declare a killer,
their name is embedded in the wood.

206
00:22:12,547 --> 00:22:17,027
Since the shape and grain of each piece
is unique, they're impossible to forge.

207
00:22:17,385 --> 00:22:20,985
You understand the legalistic
drawback to Precrime methodology.

208
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:23,946
- Here we go again.
- I'm not with the ACLU on this...

209
00:22:24,226 --> 00:22:26,786
...but we arrest individuals
who've broken no law.

210
00:22:27,062 --> 00:22:29,622
- They will.
- The commission is metaphysics.

211
00:22:29,898 --> 00:22:32,538
The Pre-Cogs see the future,
and they're never wrong.

212
00:22:32,818 --> 00:22:34,538
But it's not the future if you stop it.

213
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:38,099
- Isn't that a fundamental paradox?
- Yes.

214
00:22:38,407 --> 00:22:42,207
You're talking about predetermination,
which happens all the time.

215
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:47,690
- Why'd you catch that?
- It was gonna fall.

216
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,159
You're certain?

217
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:51,739
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

218
00:22:53,424 --> 00:22:56,624
Preventing it doesn't change
the fact that it was going to happen.

219
00:22:56,927 --> 00:22:59,247
You ever get any false positives?

220
00:22:59,513 --> 00:23:04,353
Someone intends to kill, but doesn't.
How do the Pre-Cogs tell the difference?

221
00:23:04,726 --> 00:23:08,446
They don't see what you intend to do,
only what you will do.

222
00:23:08,773 --> 00:23:11,613
Why can't they see
rapes, assaults, suicides?

223
00:23:11,901 --> 00:23:13,861
Because of the nature of murder.

224
00:23:14,111 --> 00:23:17,351
Nothing's more destructive to the
metaphysical fabric that binds us...

225
00:23:17,657 --> 00:23:21,537
...than the untimely murder of a human.
- That wasn't Walt Whitman.

226
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:26,430
Iris Hineman. She developed Pre-Cogs,
designed the system and the interface.

227
00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:29,591
Speaking of interfacing,
I'd love to say hello.

228
00:23:29,878 --> 00:23:33,158
- To Hineman?
- To them.

229
00:23:33,924 --> 00:23:38,244
- Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.
- You've never been inside?

230
00:23:38,595 --> 00:23:41,875
We keep strict separation so that
no one can be accused of tampering.

231
00:23:42,183 --> 00:23:46,263
- I'll be the first one to go in then?
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

232
00:23:46,646 --> 00:23:50,326
- If it's a question of authority...
- There is no question.

233
00:23:50,649 --> 00:23:52,409
You don't have any.

234
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:55,860
I have a warrant in my pocket
that says different.

235
00:24:07,542 --> 00:24:10,462
- Show it to me.
- Sure.

236
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:18,479
This investigation of Precrime
and its personnel is conducted...

237
00:24:18,762 --> 00:24:23,202
...under the direct supervision and
permission from the attorney general.

238
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,767
I'm here as his representative...

239
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:29,940
...which means you're now operating
under my supervision.

240
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:37,687
Seems you've been left
out of the loop.

241
00:24:47,376 --> 00:24:50,336
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

242
00:24:56,385 --> 00:25:00,305
- Hold it right there. Hold on.
- Not cleared for access.

243
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:04,251
Eye-dent: John Anderton. Approved.

244
00:25:11,693 --> 00:25:13,533
- Wally.
- No, no, no, no.

245
00:25:13,778 --> 00:25:16,978
Danny Witwer from Justice.
We're to give him the run of the farm.

246
00:25:17,282 --> 00:25:19,802
- I can't touch you.
- Don't touch anything.

247
00:25:20,076 --> 00:25:23,236
- You can't be in here.
- Just answer his questions.

248
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:26,019
- Tell me how...
- They're sleeping.

249
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:29,132
Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

250
00:25:30,421 --> 00:25:33,181
The photon milk acts as both a
nutrient supply and conductor.

251
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:37,586
It enhances the images they receive.
We call the female Agatha.

252
00:25:37,928 --> 00:25:42,728
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell.
We scan by way of optical tomography.

253
00:25:43,101 --> 00:25:45,861
White-light pinpoints pulse
along the length of the headgear...

254
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:49,145
...and are reread after absorption
through their brain tissue.

255
00:25:50,067 --> 00:25:52,827
In other words, we see what they see.

256
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:57,762
They don't feel pain. We keep
their heads stocked with dopamine.

257
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:01,435
Plus, we maintain careful control
over their serotonin levels.

258
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:04,633
Don't want them to drift off
into too deep a sleep.

259
00:26:04,915 --> 00:26:09,395
- They can't be kept too awake either.
- Don't think of them as human.

260
00:26:10,379 --> 00:26:13,299
No. They're much more than that.

261
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:18,680
Science has stolen
most of our miracles.

262
00:26:20,557 --> 00:26:24,477
In a way, they give us hope,
hope of the existence of the divine.

263
00:26:24,812 --> 00:26:28,492
It's interesting that some people
have begun to deify the Pre-Cogs.

264
00:26:28,815 --> 00:26:30,975
Pre-Cogs are pattern-recognition filters.
That's all.

265
00:26:31,235 --> 00:26:34,195
- Yet you call this room the "temple. "
- A nickname.

266
00:26:34,488 --> 00:26:36,568
The oracle isn't where
the power is, anyway.

267
00:26:36,824 --> 00:26:41,304
The power is with the priests,
even if they had to invent the oracle.

268
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:45,877
You guys are nodding like you know
what he's talking about.

269
00:26:46,417 --> 00:26:50,457
Well, come on, chief. The way we work,
changing destiny and all...

270
00:26:50,796 --> 00:26:52,796
...we're more like clergy than cops.

271
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,609
- Jad.
- Yeah?

272
00:26:55,051 --> 00:26:58,291
Go to work. All of you.

273
00:27:06,521 --> 00:27:08,601
Sorry. Old habit.

274
00:27:08,857 --> 00:27:12,377
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary
before I became a cop.

275
00:27:12,695 --> 00:27:15,815
- My father was proud.
- What does he think of your work?

276
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:20,635
I don't know. He was shot and killed
when I was 15 at our church in Dublin.

277
00:27:20,995 --> 00:27:23,795
I know what it's like
to lose someone close.

278
00:27:24,081 --> 00:27:26,241
Nothing's like the loss of a child.

279
00:27:26,501 --> 00:27:30,581
I don't have any children, so I can
only imagine what that was like.

280
00:27:30,922 --> 00:27:34,442
To lose your son
in such a public place like that...

281
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:37,839
Now we can make sure that
kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone.

282
00:27:38,138 --> 00:27:41,738
- Tell me what it is you're looking for.
- Flaws.

283
00:27:42,225 --> 00:27:44,825
There hasn't been a murder
in six years. This system is...

284
00:27:45,104 --> 00:27:49,544
Perfect. I agree.
If there's a flaw, it's human.

285
00:27:50,192 --> 00:27:52,152
It always is.

286
00:27:53,070 --> 00:27:54,950
John.

287
00:28:37,617 --> 00:28:38,697
Wally.

288
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:48,464
Can you see?

289
00:29:20,662 --> 00:29:24,142
What happened? Her ACTH levels
just shot through the roof!

290
00:29:24,457 --> 00:29:26,337
- What'd you do?
- She grabbed me.

291
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:30,265
Impossible. They're not aware of us.
In the milk, all they see is the future.

292
00:29:30,589 --> 00:29:34,469
- She looked straight at me.
- It could have been a nightmare.

293
00:29:34,801 --> 00:29:37,921
- She spoke to me.
- To you?

294
00:29:38,222 --> 00:29:39,982
What'd she say?

295
00:29:40,223 --> 00:29:42,623
"Can you see?"

296
00:30:02,539 --> 00:30:04,059
You the sentry?

297
00:30:04,874 --> 00:30:07,514
Yes, sir, I'm Gideon.

298
00:30:07,794 --> 00:30:09,794
You're Chief Anderton.

299
00:30:10,631 --> 00:30:13,191
The music relaxes the prisoners.

300
00:30:13,467 --> 00:30:16,827
I don't ever see you Precops down here.
Am I in trouble?

301
00:30:17,263 --> 00:30:20,223
Not yet.
I'm interested in a murder.

302
00:30:20,517 --> 00:30:23,957
- I got plenty of those. Kill type?
- Drowning.

303
00:30:24,270 --> 00:30:27,070
That narrows it down.
Not too many in here for that.

304
00:30:27,357 --> 00:30:30,677
- Victim's Caucasian, female.
- This about the Justice Department?

305
00:30:30,985 --> 00:30:35,265
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour
they got tomorrow. You like this tie?

306
00:30:35,616 --> 00:30:36,616
Stop.

307
00:30:40,370 --> 00:30:41,690
Roll back.

308
00:30:43,249 --> 00:30:44,489
There.

309
00:30:44,709 --> 00:30:50,309
She's a golden oldie. One of our first.
Probably before your time.

310
00:30:50,923 --> 00:30:54,843
- This is the composite of the three?
- That's right.

311
00:30:55,177 --> 00:30:58,097
Combined data stream
based on all three previsions.

312
00:30:58,389 --> 00:31:01,629
- Just show me Agatha's data stream.
- For that...

313
00:31:03,811 --> 00:31:05,531
...we go for a ride.

314
00:31:27,336 --> 00:31:29,136
My God.

315
00:31:29,505 --> 00:31:31,585
I'd forgotten there were so many.

316
00:31:31,841 --> 00:31:36,561
And to think they'd all be out there
killing people if it wasn't for you.

317
00:31:37,221 --> 00:31:40,021
Look at them.
Look at how peaceful they seem.

318
00:31:40,308 --> 00:31:44,068
But on the inside: Busy, busy, busy.

319
00:31:44,395 --> 00:31:48,755
Okey-pokey.
Now that is one bad man.

320
00:31:49,151 --> 00:31:52,511
He drowned a woman named
Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

321
00:31:52,821 --> 00:31:56,501
The killer's a John Doe,
never identified.

322
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:16,090
Why is he still a John Doe?
Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan?

323
00:32:16,429 --> 00:32:20,989
Those are not his eyes. He had them
swapped out to fool the scanners.

324
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:25,191
You can get it done on the street
for a few thousand bucks these days.

325
00:32:25,522 --> 00:32:29,202
Okay, so you want
just the female prevision.

326
00:32:29,527 --> 00:32:31,087
That's right.

327
00:32:37,243 --> 00:32:40,403
We don't seem to have her data.

328
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:42,928
Try again.

329
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:47,897
This is odd. See?

330
00:32:48,212 --> 00:32:52,892
We have the two previsions. We got
what Art saw. We got what Dash saw.

331
00:32:53,260 --> 00:32:56,180
But Agatha's isn't here.

332
00:32:58,640 --> 00:33:00,120
Probably just a glitch.

333
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,510
Tell me about the intended victim,
this Anne Lively.

334
00:33:05,063 --> 00:33:08,903
Looks like she's a neuroin addict,
like our John Doe here.

335
00:33:09,235 --> 00:33:12,075
Address history
includes the Beaton Clinic.

336
00:33:12,362 --> 00:33:15,442
So she cleaned up.
Where is she now?

337
00:33:17,243 --> 00:33:19,963
I guess glitches come in twos.

338
00:33:21,455 --> 00:33:26,295
You finally crawl your way out
of one hole just to fall into another.

339
00:33:31,675 --> 00:33:32,675
No.

340
00:33:34,094 --> 00:33:37,014
Can't let you take that out of here,
chief.

341
00:33:37,931 --> 00:33:41,571
- It's against the rules.
- Anything else against the rules?

342
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:53,191
Careful, chief. You dig up the past,
all you get is dirty.

343
00:33:58,119 --> 00:34:01,559
The third prevision was what,
kind of fuzzy or something?

344
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:05,954
No, the third prevision,
Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

345
00:34:06,336 --> 00:34:11,256
That's not all. There are a dozen more
cases with missing previsions.

346
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:14,753
You'd think we'd have found
the cure for the common cold.

347
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,295
- It's stress.
- What's this?

348
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,477
Herbal tea with honey.

349
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:23,127
I hate herbal tea.
Almost as much as I hate honey.

350
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:26,199
Just drink it,
before I pour it in your lap.

351
00:34:26,482 --> 00:34:29,242
- Can I get you anything, John?
- No, thank you.

352
00:34:29,736 --> 00:34:33,176
Witwer's scheduled for a tour
of Containment tomorrow.

353
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,411
Yeah, give him a tour.

354
00:34:36,868 --> 00:34:39,268
- Lara called me.
- What?

355
00:34:39,997 --> 00:34:43,197
She's worried about you.
Quite frankly, so am I.

356
00:34:44,084 --> 00:34:45,364
I'm fine.

357
00:34:45,627 --> 00:34:49,347
I understand you've been spending
a lot of time in the Sprawl.

358
00:34:50,841 --> 00:34:53,721
- I go running down there.
- In the middle of the night.

359
00:34:54,511 --> 00:34:57,471
What if Danny Witwer
insisted on a full chem run?

360
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:59,406
I'm fine.

361
00:35:00,976 --> 00:35:05,256
The minute Precrime goes national,
they are going to take it away.

362
00:35:05,648 --> 00:35:07,888
- We won't let them.
- No?

363
00:35:08,192 --> 00:35:12,312
How is an old man and a cop on the
whiff ever going to stop them?

364
00:35:13,198 --> 00:35:15,398
My father once said to me...

365
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:19,700
..."You don't choose the things
you believe in. They choose you. "

366
00:35:20,038 --> 00:35:21,878
There's a reason you are here.

367
00:35:22,165 --> 00:35:27,685
Had Precrime been in place earlier,
your loss would have been prevented.

368
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:29,610
Remember, the eyes...

369
00:35:32,009 --> 00:35:35,289
The eyes of the nation
are on us right now.

370
00:35:35,763 --> 00:35:38,843
I'm not the generation
anyone listens to...

371
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:43,183
...but people trust you when you
speak of your belief in Precrime.

372
00:35:43,938 --> 00:35:48,218
They know that it's a belief born of
pain, not politics. I understood that.

373
00:35:48,568 --> 00:35:52,008
I may have even encouraged it
to help with the cause.

374
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,580
But now,
your pain is hurting both of us.

375
00:36:01,749 --> 00:36:04,309
They're not going to take it
away from us.

376
00:36:05,419 --> 00:36:07,019
I won't let them.

377
00:36:37,744 --> 00:36:39,104
Bingo.

378
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:54,103
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hey, buddy.

379
00:36:54,387 --> 00:36:56,227
- I made up a club.
- Yeah?

380
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:59,994
- We're called the Crescos.
- The Crescos.

381
00:37:00,351 --> 00:37:02,751
- We made up a soccer team.
- Yeah?

382
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:05,663
- We practice at school.
- With Connor?

383
00:37:05,983 --> 00:37:08,903
Your daddy's in a lot of trouble,
Sean.

384
00:37:34,053 --> 00:37:36,413
- Wait!
- No!

385
00:37:39,184 --> 00:37:41,784
Jad, how come you're not with
Father Witwer?

386
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:47,623
We're in motion on something. We got a
white, male victim, about 5' 10", 170.

387
00:37:48,026 --> 00:37:50,506
He takes a round in the 10-ring
and goes out a window.

388
00:37:50,821 --> 00:37:52,541
- Red Ball?
- Nope. Brown Ball.

389
00:37:52,823 --> 00:37:53,983
It's premeditated.

390
00:37:54,241 --> 00:37:57,721
Amazing. There's someone within
200 miles still dumb enough to do that.

391
00:37:58,037 --> 00:37:59,517
The victim's name is Leo Crow.

392
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:04,149
This is case number 1109. Time of
occurrence: Friday, 1506 hours.

393
00:38:04,543 --> 00:38:08,823
Start search for Leo Crow. Case 1109,
previsualized by the Pre-Cogs...

394
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:12,375
...recorded on holosphere
by Precrime's Q-stacks.

395
00:38:12,718 --> 00:38:16,998
My fellow witnesses are Dr. Katherine
James and Chief Justice Frank Pollard.

396
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,590
Good morning.

397
00:38:18,851 --> 00:38:21,411
Are you ready
to preview and validate 1109?

398
00:38:21,728 --> 00:38:24,528
- Ready when you are, John.
- Standing by.

399
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:32,124
I love this part.

400
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:38,040
I've got no address. No tax returns
for the last five years.

401
00:38:38,412 --> 00:38:40,892
Check NCIC.
Maybe he's got a number.

402
00:38:41,833 --> 00:38:45,433
We'll send a protection team
as soon as we lock location.

403
00:38:48,715 --> 00:38:51,315
It looks like federal housing.
Concrete, glass, egg crates.

404
00:38:51,593 --> 00:38:54,553
Ouch. About a thousand of those
in the District.

405
00:38:56,181 --> 00:38:57,901
Fractured images coming in.

406
00:38:58,183 --> 00:39:00,463
Numbers nine...

407
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:04,745
Nine, six.

408
00:39:09,403 --> 00:39:13,243
Female, senior. She's smoking a pipe.

409
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:15,482
She's laughing.

410
00:39:19,121 --> 00:39:21,161
Okay, now I'm inside a room.

411
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,807
Windowpanes, aluminum extrusion.

412
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:28,501
Two figures resolving in the room.

413
00:39:29,674 --> 00:39:31,714
- Wait!
- No...

414
00:39:35,347 --> 00:39:37,467
Looks like we got a third party.

415
00:39:38,434 --> 00:39:40,994
Wearing sunglasses,
just out the window.

416
00:39:41,812 --> 00:39:43,692
You're not gonna kill me.

417
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:47,917
Goodbye, Crow.

418
00:39:53,908 --> 00:39:55,708
You're not gonna kill me.

419
00:39:56,161 --> 00:39:58,081
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Wait!

420
00:40:02,042 --> 00:40:04,082
Wait. Wait.

421
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:06,510
You say something, chief?

422
00:40:06,796 --> 00:40:07,956
No.

423
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:13,110
I'll get this one.

424
00:40:13,637 --> 00:40:15,597
We got time on this one, Jad.

425
00:40:15,847 --> 00:40:18,687
Mind getting me a piece
of cake they're eating?

426
00:40:19,018 --> 00:40:20,778
- I'm starving.
- Sure, chief.

427
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:23,740
I think I'll get one for myself too.

428
00:40:24,023 --> 00:40:25,463
Take your time.

429
00:40:42,209 --> 00:40:45,729
Chief Anderton,
what is this that I'm seeing?

430
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:48,028
I'm confused about...

431
00:41:19,998 --> 00:41:21,958
- Anderton, wait!
- Goodbye, Crow.

432
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:23,530
Anderton, wait!

433
00:41:25,462 --> 00:41:27,302
Anderton, wait!

434
00:41:33,554 --> 00:41:37,194
I like you, chief.
You've always been nice to me.

435
00:41:39,602 --> 00:41:42,482
Give you two minutes
before I hit the alarm.

436
00:41:58,998 --> 00:42:00,358
Hold that, please.

437
00:42:01,708 --> 00:42:02,908
Thanks.

438
00:42:06,255 --> 00:42:09,775
- You're in a lot of trouble, John.
- You set me up.

439
00:42:10,134 --> 00:42:12,934
I'll write the paranoia off to the
whiff you've been doping on.

440
00:42:13,262 --> 00:42:14,462
Easy.

441
00:42:14,722 --> 00:42:16,882
- Easy.
- Seems I've found a flaw.

442
00:42:19,477 --> 00:42:20,637
What are you gonna do?

443
00:42:20,895 --> 00:42:23,695
Possession will cost you six months
and your badge.

444
00:42:23,982 --> 00:42:26,382
I guess we won't be working together
after all.

445
00:42:26,693 --> 00:42:30,173
Now put the gun down, John.
I don't hear a Red Ball.

446
00:42:51,761 --> 00:42:53,761
Lamar. Lamar.

447
00:42:56,433 --> 00:42:58,713
- Lamar?
- John, what is happening?

448
00:42:59,018 --> 00:43:00,938
It's Witwer. He set me up!

449
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:02,467
Stop, just wait.

450
00:43:02,689 --> 00:43:05,529
- Witwer! It's Witwer.
- Who's the victim?

451
00:43:05,859 --> 00:43:07,419
- Somebody.
- Who?

452
00:43:07,694 --> 00:43:09,614
- Somebody... Leo Crow.
- Who is he?

453
00:43:09,905 --> 00:43:12,545
I have no idea!
I've never heard of him.

454
00:43:12,867 --> 00:43:15,747
But I'm supposed to kill him
in less than 36 hours.

455
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:19,196
- How could Witwer have access?
- Can you fake a cerebral output?

456
00:43:19,540 --> 00:43:21,100
- Why would anyone want to?
- Can you?

457
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:23,615
- I doubt it.
- Would Hineman know?

458
00:43:23,878 --> 00:43:25,878
- Now listen, come in.
- What?

459
00:43:26,172 --> 00:43:28,492
I'll protect you until we
get to the bottom of this.

460
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,720
Talk to Wally. See if Witwer's gone
inside the temple again.

461
00:43:32,053 --> 00:43:35,373
Ask Jad for any off-hour
eye-dents into the analytical room.

462
00:43:36,266 --> 00:43:37,986
Who's Leo Crow?

463
00:43:38,268 --> 00:43:40,948
Security lockdown enabled.
Revised destination: Office.

464
00:43:41,229 --> 00:43:43,829
Lamar, they found me.

465
00:43:48,362 --> 00:43:51,442
Is there any way to override
the lockdown?

466
00:43:51,782 --> 00:43:53,622
- No, no, no.
- No?

467
00:43:53,909 --> 00:43:57,269
I'll meet you anywhere you say.
You can come to my house, John.

468
00:43:57,621 --> 00:44:00,101
I can't. They'll get me.
I'm not gonna get haloed.

469
00:44:00,416 --> 00:44:01,496
You can't run.

470
00:44:02,501 --> 00:44:03,701
Everybody runs.

471
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:52,642
- Oh, my God!
- Hey, hey.

472
00:45:07,319 --> 00:45:09,879
Oh, my gosh, are you okay?

473
00:45:13,243 --> 00:45:15,363
I'll bring him in. Unharmed.

474
00:45:15,661 --> 00:45:18,221
You're not gonna do that.
I'm taking control.

475
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:19,698
What?

476
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:24,198
Fletcher is second in command.
It's his show to run. You can observe.

477
00:45:24,587 --> 00:45:27,827
- Do it. Find him.
- Yes, sir.

478
00:45:29,969 --> 00:45:33,449
He came to see you the other day
right before he was tagged.

479
00:45:33,805 --> 00:45:36,285
- What did you talk about?
- The Mets.

480
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:39,320
John doesn't think they have a deep
enough pitching roster.

481
00:45:39,645 --> 00:45:43,365
Why are you protecting him? You knew
he was doping, yet you did nothing.

482
00:45:43,733 --> 00:45:46,933
- The man lost a child, for chrissake.
- Six years ago.

483
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:50,198
- What did you talk about?
- None of your business.

484
00:45:50,531 --> 00:45:54,851
It's my business. Investigation of a
supervising officer for a capital crime...

485
00:45:55,203 --> 00:45:59,163
...falls under federal jurisdiction
so as to rule out any conspiracy.

486
00:45:59,541 --> 00:46:01,861
- He's my suspect.
- He's my subordinate.

487
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:05,649
Call the attorney general. I'm sure
he'd clarify the issue for you.

488
00:46:06,006 --> 00:46:09,206
I don't want John Anderton hurt.

489
00:46:11,220 --> 00:46:13,500
I'm going to enjoy working here.

490
00:46:16,475 --> 00:46:18,635
A road diverges in the desert.

491
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:20,592
Lexus.

492
00:46:20,854 --> 00:46:24,574
The road you're on, John Anderton,
is the one less-traveled.

493
00:46:24,942 --> 00:46:27,942
- Make sure you...
- Diamonds...

494
00:46:30,239 --> 00:46:32,279
Good evening, John Anderton.

495
00:46:35,579 --> 00:46:39,339
John Anderton! You could use
a Guinness right about now.

496
00:46:42,002 --> 00:46:44,642
- John Anderton...
- Escape from it all.

497
00:46:44,963 --> 00:46:49,443
Get away, John Anderton.
Forget your troubles.

498
00:47:06,611 --> 00:47:10,891
He's been eye-dented on the Metro.
The train stops at 20th and 33rd.

499
00:47:11,282 --> 00:47:13,002
Send units to each location.

500
00:47:13,285 --> 00:47:15,005
- Better make 20th.
- Have faith.

501
00:47:56,121 --> 00:47:57,481
Fire them up!

502
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,610
- Hey, Fletch.
- Hey, John.

503
00:48:23,858 --> 00:48:25,938
- That was a rough landing.
- Yeah.

504
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:28,554
- Work on that.
- It's the shit knee of mine.

505
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,704
- Yeah.
- Don't do it.

506
00:48:31,533 --> 00:48:33,293
Hey, don't do this.

507
00:48:34,119 --> 00:48:35,319
John?

508
00:48:35,704 --> 00:48:36,984
Don't run.

509
00:48:37,540 --> 00:48:39,500
You don't have to chase me.

510
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,767
You don't have to run.

511
00:48:42,169 --> 00:48:43,969
Everybody runs, Fletch.

512
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,175
You know we'll catch you.

513
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:48,898
Everybody runs.

514
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:54,889
- It doesn't have to be like this, John.
- Everybody runs.

515
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:57,264
Get your sick-sticks ready.

516
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:00,408
Everybody runs, Fletch.

517
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:03,503
Slow down, chief. Just take it easy.

518
00:49:07,613 --> 00:49:09,453
No sudden moves, chief.

519
00:49:10,740 --> 00:49:12,660
John, it's okay.

520
00:49:13,202 --> 00:49:15,322
- Fletch...
- Easy does it, chief.

521
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:45,225
Got a grip?

522
00:49:45,444 --> 00:49:47,124
- Got a grip?
- Yeah.

523
00:50:15,975 --> 00:50:17,335
Anderton!

524
00:50:48,551 --> 00:50:51,151
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

525
00:50:51,471 --> 00:50:54,391
Get out of my house!
Get out of my house! Go!

526
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:59,919
- Get them out of here!
- Anderton, stop!

527
00:51:00,189 --> 00:51:02,789
Pull him off me, Fletcher.
Get him off me.

528
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:07,690
Get him out of here!
What's the matter with you?!

529
00:51:12,910 --> 00:51:15,030
Get out of my house! Go!

530
00:51:35,685 --> 00:51:39,805
By mandate of the District of Columbia,
I'm placing you under arrest for...

531
00:51:40,189 --> 00:51:41,469
Go to sleep.

532
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:03,900
You two stay with me!

533
00:56:34,831 --> 00:56:36,191
Dr. Hineman.

534
00:56:36,875 --> 00:56:39,955
You're trespassing.
I don't have visitors.

535
00:56:45,384 --> 00:56:48,264
That would be from the doll's eye,
the vine...

536
00:56:48,553 --> 00:56:51,753
...the baneberry that scratched you
during your illegal climb over my wall.

537
00:56:52,057 --> 00:56:55,737
It's not a true doll's eye.
It's a little hybrid I designed.

538
00:56:56,103 --> 00:56:59,703
Once the poison gets into your
bloodstream, you'll start to see...

539
00:57:00,066 --> 00:57:04,066
...the most extraordinary display
of blue objects.

540
00:57:04,403 --> 00:57:07,763
This just isn't your week, is it?

541
00:57:09,409 --> 00:57:10,849
Chief Anderton.

542
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:14,849
I'm not a killer.

543
00:57:20,962 --> 00:57:22,362
You better drink this.

544
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:26,511
Soon you won't be able to swallow,
and then you'll be totally buggered.

545
00:57:27,928 --> 00:57:29,128
All of it.

546
00:57:29,930 --> 00:57:33,210
Okay, now take a minute
to right yourself.

547
00:57:34,726 --> 00:57:38,166
Just what is it you think
I can do for you?

548
00:57:40,775 --> 00:57:45,015
You could tell me how someone
can fake a prevision.

549
00:57:45,405 --> 00:57:47,285
How would I know that?

550
00:57:47,741 --> 00:57:50,141
Because you invented Precrime.

551
00:57:52,287 --> 00:57:53,807
What's so funny?

552
00:57:54,372 --> 00:57:59,252
If the consequences of several genetic
mistakes and science gone haywire...

553
00:57:59,627 --> 00:58:02,387
...can be called an invention,
then I invented Precrime.

554
00:58:02,714 --> 00:58:04,634
- You don't seem proud.
- I'm not.

555
00:58:04,925 --> 00:58:07,965
I was trying to heal them,
not turn them into something else.

556
00:58:08,262 --> 00:58:10,942
- Heal who?
- The innocents we use to stop the guilty.

557
00:58:11,265 --> 00:58:14,345
You're talking about the Pre-Cogs.

558
00:58:14,686 --> 00:58:19,646
You think they came from a test tube?
They are merely the ones who survived.

559
00:58:20,066 --> 00:58:23,706
I was doing genetic research,
treating children of drug addicts.

560
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:27,550
This was 10 years ago,
when neuroin first hit the streets.

561
00:58:27,908 --> 00:58:33,828
It was impure, not the engineered
cocktail popular among the educated.

562
00:58:34,998 --> 00:58:40,518
All of these kids were born with severe
brain damage. Most died before age 12.

563
00:58:40,963 --> 00:58:43,563
Those few who survived,
they had a gift.

564
00:58:43,841 --> 00:58:47,041
I call it a gift. For them,
it was more like a cosmic joke.

565
00:58:47,387 --> 00:58:50,027
They would wake up in the night,
curled in the corner...

566
00:58:50,347 --> 00:58:52,187
...screaming, clawing at the walls.

567
00:58:52,475 --> 00:58:56,635
Because when these children
closed their eyes at night...

568
00:58:56,979 --> 00:59:01,259
...they dreamt only of murder
over and over, one after the other.

569
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:05,050
It didn't take for us long to realize
that the real nightmare was...

570
00:59:05,405 --> 00:59:10,165
...that these dreams were about to come
true, these murders were happening.

571
00:59:14,289 --> 00:59:16,609
You say some of the children died?

572
00:59:16,917 --> 00:59:19,997
So many of them.
Despite what we did for them.

573
00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:24,417
Or maybe because of what we
did to them. But it doesn't matter.

574
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:27,480
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

575
00:59:28,721 --> 00:59:30,761
I'm not going to commit murder.

576
00:59:31,057 --> 00:59:33,337
I've never met the man
I'm supposed to kill.

577
00:59:33,643 --> 00:59:37,723
And yet a chain of events has started
that will lead you to his murder.

578
00:59:38,106 --> 00:59:40,786
- Not if I stay away from him.
- Can you avoid a man you've never met?

579
00:59:41,109 --> 00:59:43,949
- You won't help?
- I can't help you. Nobody can.

580
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:46,960
The Pre-Cogs are never wrong.

581
00:59:49,451 --> 00:59:51,491
But occasionally...

582
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,161
...they do disagree.

583
00:59:55,749 --> 00:59:56,869
What?

584
00:59:57,209 --> 01:00:01,729
Most of the time, all three Pre-Cogs
will see an event in the same way...

585
01:00:02,089 --> 01:00:05,889
...but once in a while, one of them will
see things differently than the others.

586
01:00:06,219 --> 01:00:10,099
Jesus Christ.
Why didn't I know about this?

587
01:00:11,015 --> 01:00:14,095
Because these Minority Reports
are destroyed the instant they occur.

588
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:15,514
Why?

589
01:00:15,729 --> 01:00:20,489
For Precrime to function, there can't
be any suggestion of fallibility.

590
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:23,859
Who wants a justice system
that instills doubt?

591
01:00:24,155 --> 01:00:26,955
It may be reasonable,
but it's still doubt.

592
01:00:28,492 --> 01:00:31,212
Are you saying
I've haloed innocent people?

593
01:00:31,495 --> 01:00:35,095
I'm saying that every so often,
those accused of a Precrime...

594
01:00:35,416 --> 01:00:37,896
...just might have
an alternate future.

595
01:00:38,169 --> 01:00:41,929
Does Burgess know about this,
about this Minority Report?

596
01:00:42,298 --> 01:00:45,698
I used to joke with Lamar that
we were the parents of Precrime.

597
01:00:46,010 --> 01:00:50,730
Parents often see their children as they
want them to be and not as they are.

598
01:00:51,099 --> 01:00:56,059
Answer my question: Does Lamar
Burgess know about the Minority Report?

599
01:00:56,438 --> 01:00:58,038
Yes, of course, he knew.

600
01:00:58,273 --> 01:01:03,313
But at the time, we felt their existence
was an insignificant variable.

601
01:01:03,696 --> 01:01:05,576
Insignificant to you, maybe.

602
01:01:05,822 --> 01:01:09,462
But what about those people that
I put away with alternate futures?

603
01:01:09,827 --> 01:01:13,347
- My God, if the country knew...
- The system would collapse.

604
01:01:15,541 --> 01:01:18,061
- I believe in that system.
- Do you really?

605
01:01:18,336 --> 01:01:19,896
You wanna bring it down.

606
01:01:20,130 --> 01:01:23,890
You will bring it down
if you manage to kill your victim.

607
01:01:24,217 --> 01:01:29,097
That'll be the most spectacular public
display of how Precrime didn't work.

608
01:01:29,473 --> 01:01:32,313
- I'm not gonna kill anybody.
- Hold that thought.

609
01:01:32,601 --> 01:01:35,921
- Why should I trust you?
- You shouldn't trust anyone.

610
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:39,350
Certainly not the attorney general,
who wants it all for himself.

611
01:01:39,650 --> 01:01:42,290
And not the young federal agent,
who wants your job.

612
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:46,651
Not even the old man who just wants
to hang on to what he created.

613
01:01:46,990 --> 01:01:50,270
Don't trust anyone.
Just find the Minority Report.

614
01:01:52,330 --> 01:01:54,010
You said the Minority Report
is destroyed.

615
01:01:54,332 --> 01:01:57,892
The record is destroyed.
The original report still exists.

616
01:01:58,211 --> 01:02:03,251
I designed it so the report is stored
in a safe place, but not declared.

617
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:05,833
What safe place is that?

618
01:02:06,094 --> 01:02:09,214
The safest place there is.

619
01:02:09,557 --> 01:02:12,397
Where is it?

620
01:02:14,645 --> 01:02:18,485
Inside the Pre-Cog who predicted it.

621
01:02:23,237 --> 01:02:27,597
All you have to do
is download it, darling.

622
01:02:29,368 --> 01:02:30,968
That's all, huh?

623
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:37,178
Just walk into Precrime,
get into the temple...

624
01:02:37,460 --> 01:02:41,940
...somehow tap into these Pre-Cogs
and download this Minority Report.

625
01:02:42,299 --> 01:02:44,699
- If you have one.
- And then walk out.

626
01:02:44,968 --> 01:02:49,288
Actually, you'll have to run out.
But yes, that's what you have to do.

627
01:02:50,349 --> 01:02:52,309
You're insane.

628
01:02:53,018 --> 01:02:55,058
Or you think I am.

629
01:02:55,312 --> 01:03:00,312
I'll get eye-scanned a dozen times
before I get within 10 miles of Precrime.

630
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:05,333
Sometimes in order to see the light,
you have to risk the dark.

631
01:03:05,699 --> 01:03:08,899
As a policeman...
Excuse me, as a former policeman...

632
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,802
...I'm sure that you know
all sorts of people...

633
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:15,282
...who can help you out
in this regard.

634
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:24,468
It's funny how all
living organisms are alike.

635
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:28,319
When the chips are down,
when the pressure is on...

636
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:31,479
...every creature
on the face of the earth...

637
01:03:31,768 --> 01:03:35,088
...is interested in one thing
and one thing only:

638
01:03:36,230 --> 01:03:38,350
Its own survival.

639
01:03:40,068 --> 01:03:42,148
Find the Minority Report.

640
01:03:47,326 --> 01:03:49,966
How do I even know which one has it?

641
01:03:50,245 --> 01:03:53,445
It's always in the more gifted
of the three.

642
01:03:55,167 --> 01:03:57,007
Which one is that?

643
01:04:00,047 --> 01:04:01,847
The female.

644
01:04:05,010 --> 01:04:08,570
We've got three men in a room.
The victim is here...

645
01:04:08,889 --> 01:04:12,929
...John is here, and this
unidentified male, at the window.

646
01:04:13,269 --> 01:04:16,949
The adjacent building suggests
public housing, which means...

647
01:04:17,273 --> 01:04:19,993
- There's thousands like this one.
- They're everywhere.

648
01:04:20,277 --> 01:04:23,077
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow
for another 22 hours.

649
01:04:23,363 --> 01:04:25,483
This is Chief Anderton's space.

650
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:27,580
- He's not here.
- He'll be back.

651
01:04:27,826 --> 01:04:31,426
I doubt that. I'm betting
he's somewhere in the Sprawl.

652
01:04:31,747 --> 01:04:35,427
He's smart enough to go
where billboards can't ID him.

653
01:04:35,751 --> 01:04:38,031
There's fewer consumers,
which means fewer scanners.

654
01:04:38,295 --> 01:04:42,375
- Why won't he just run?
- Because he thinks he's innocent.

655
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:45,561
We concentrate on the Sprawl.

656
01:04:45,803 --> 01:04:48,723
We do fly-overs in ships,
with two spyder teams on the ground.

657
01:04:49,015 --> 01:04:53,175
Thermal scan the entire area. Read
anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

658
01:05:09,203 --> 01:05:10,443
Where is she?

659
01:05:29,015 --> 01:05:34,775
Started blowing buttons for no reason
whatsoever, and I knew that.

660
01:05:38,608 --> 01:05:40,608
This damn cold.

661
01:05:41,862 --> 01:05:45,942
Don't worry. I could cut open your
chest and sew a dead cat in there...

662
01:05:46,283 --> 01:05:50,763
...you wouldn't get an infection. Not
with the antibios I'll shoot into you.

663
01:05:51,121 --> 01:05:52,561
That's comforting.

664
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:56,070
You do understand I can't just
give you new irises?

665
01:05:56,377 --> 01:05:57,777
Please, don't touch.

666
01:05:58,004 --> 01:06:01,804
Because the scanners would read the
new scar tissue, alarms will go off...

667
01:06:02,133 --> 01:06:04,613
...and large men with guns will appear.

668
01:06:07,179 --> 01:06:08,859
What was that?

669
01:06:09,098 --> 01:06:10,218
What was that?

670
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:14,873
- It's anesthesia. It's all downhill...
- You always sneak up on your patients?

671
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:19,190
You wouldn't break the hand
of a violinist before the concert.

672
01:06:19,526 --> 01:06:21,086
Please, relax.

673
01:06:25,699 --> 01:06:30,779
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll
have to remove your eyes completely.

674
01:06:31,163 --> 01:06:32,283
I know.

675
01:06:33,249 --> 01:06:37,289
- I have to replace them with new ones.
- I know. But I wanna keep the old ones.

676
01:06:37,629 --> 01:06:41,149
- Why?
- Because my mother gave them to me.

677
01:06:41,466 --> 01:06:43,746
What's it to you?
You can't resell them.

678
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:46,810
Whatever you say. It's your money.

679
01:06:54,188 --> 01:06:58,668
Let me introduce my gorgeous
assistant, Miss Van Eyck.

680
01:07:19,631 --> 01:07:23,871
- This is not a lot of money.
- It's all that I could safely move.

681
01:07:26,972 --> 01:07:28,532
Okay.

682
01:07:32,394 --> 01:07:35,634
- What did you give me?
- Smile medicine.

683
01:07:35,939 --> 01:07:38,339
Tell you what, since we go way back...

684
01:07:38,609 --> 01:07:42,729
...why don't I give you my old pal
discount? What do you say?

685
01:07:43,072 --> 01:07:45,232
You don't remember me, do you?

686
01:07:45,491 --> 01:07:48,851
- We know each other?
- Yes, we do.

687
01:07:49,245 --> 01:07:51,125
From where? D.C.?

688
01:07:51,373 --> 01:07:55,773
- Baltimore. The East Side.
- Baltimore? We go way back.

689
01:07:56,127 --> 01:08:00,007
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D.
I was a plastic surgeon.

690
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:05,380
You remember? Specialized
in burn victims, mostly women.

691
01:08:05,763 --> 01:08:09,283
- I put you away.
- Yeah, you did.

692
01:08:11,226 --> 01:08:13,386
You made those tapes.

693
01:08:13,646 --> 01:08:16,126
They were performance pieces.

694
01:08:17,524 --> 01:08:21,524
- You set your patients on fire.
- I put them out.

695
01:08:21,863 --> 01:08:27,023
Some not as quickly as others, but
let's change the subject, shall we?

696
01:08:28,995 --> 01:08:34,435
The future's so much more interesting
than the past, don't you think?

697
01:08:37,379 --> 01:08:41,259
Miss Van Eyck.
I'm afraid she's already smitten.

698
01:08:42,008 --> 01:08:46,168
She only has eyes for you.

699
01:08:47,348 --> 01:08:51,028
I know what you're thinking, John:
How can I do what I do now?

700
01:08:51,352 --> 01:08:55,872
Let's say that I spent an awful lot
of time in the prison library.

701
01:08:56,232 --> 01:09:01,232
That was a great way to avoid the more
unpleasant aspects of prison life.

702
01:09:01,613 --> 01:09:04,853
Confinement was
a real education, a real...

703
01:09:07,118 --> 01:09:08,558
...eye-opener.

704
01:09:13,083 --> 01:09:16,123
For true enlightenment,
there's nothing quite like...

705
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:19,660
...well, let's say, taking a shower
while this large fellow...

706
01:09:20,007 --> 01:09:23,367
...with an attitude you can't
knock down with a hammer...

707
01:09:23,677 --> 01:09:25,757
...whispers in your ear, "Oh, Nancy. "

708
01:09:26,013 --> 01:09:29,533
That was a lot of fun.
Thank you for putting me there...

709
01:09:29,850 --> 01:09:33,930
...and giving me the opportunity to
get to know myself so much better.

710
01:09:34,272 --> 01:09:36,632
And now to return the favor.

711
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:51,079
- This your work?
- Yes.

712
01:09:51,874 --> 01:09:53,394
I like it.

713
01:09:53,626 --> 01:09:56,586
- How do you take your coffee?
- Cream and sugar.

714
01:09:56,879 --> 01:09:59,319
- I don't have any cream. Sorry.
- Just sugar then.

715
01:09:59,590 --> 01:10:01,870
- You and John ever come here?
- We used to.

716
01:10:02,135 --> 01:10:03,895
He's not here now, is he?

717
01:10:06,138 --> 01:10:07,898
I had to ask.

718
01:10:10,392 --> 01:10:13,232
- I don't have any sugar either.
- Thank you.

719
01:10:13,521 --> 01:10:16,361
- He hasn't tried to contact you?
- No.

720
01:10:16,650 --> 01:10:19,170
Did he ever mention the name
Leo Crow?

721
01:10:19,444 --> 01:10:22,204
No, but I don't talk
to John much anymore.

722
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:25,929
- So you haven't seen his apartment.
- That was our apartment.

723
01:10:26,243 --> 01:10:29,083
Have you been there recently?
It's full of these.

724
01:10:29,371 --> 01:10:33,811
- How long has he been doping?
- Since right after we lost our son.

725
01:10:34,168 --> 01:10:39,408
- You mean after he lost your son.
- It was nobody's fault.

726
01:10:41,217 --> 01:10:45,217
But John was with him
at the public pool.

727
01:10:45,763 --> 01:10:48,243
You said in your divorce papers
that John tried to kill himself.

728
01:10:48,516 --> 01:10:51,716
- It wasn't a suicide attempt.
- What was it then?

729
01:10:52,019 --> 01:10:55,939
The FBI found something
that belonged to my son, a sandal.

730
01:10:56,274 --> 01:10:57,794
John was upset. He...

731
01:10:58,068 --> 01:11:00,908
He took out his gun
and watched home movies.

732
01:11:01,196 --> 01:11:05,316
- This is all in your statement.
- He shot a hole in the ceiling. So what?

733
01:11:05,659 --> 01:11:09,179
You lose your son,
let's see how well you handle it.

734
01:11:09,746 --> 01:11:14,626
Lamar thinks you left John because he
lost himself in Precrime instead of you.

735
01:11:15,336 --> 01:11:19,856
I left him because every time
I looked at him, I saw my son.

736
01:11:20,925 --> 01:11:25,205
Every time I got close to him,
I smelled my little boy.

737
01:11:25,555 --> 01:11:28,075
That's why I left him.

738
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:31,304
And now you can leave.

739
01:11:33,354 --> 01:11:36,394
Don't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

740
01:11:41,321 --> 01:11:45,441
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

741
01:11:46,744 --> 01:11:50,584
In the fridge, there's milk.
Greta made you a sandwich.

742
01:11:50,915 --> 01:11:53,635
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

743
01:11:53,918 --> 01:11:55,838
How do I find the bathroom?

744
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,820
The bathroom?
Now that's your right hand.

745
01:12:02,511 --> 01:12:05,031
The kitchen is your left.

746
01:12:07,348 --> 01:12:10,068
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

747
01:12:10,602 --> 01:12:15,082
Seeing as we're being pals, I'll give
you a bonus that may come in handy.

748
01:12:15,440 --> 01:12:19,640
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme.
You're gonna shoot this under your chin.

749
01:12:20,154 --> 01:12:23,394
- What is this?
- It'll turn your pretty face into mush.

750
01:12:23,699 --> 01:12:26,019
People won't even recognize you.

751
01:12:26,285 --> 01:12:30,445
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again.
But it'll hurt like you've never felt.

752
01:12:30,790 --> 01:12:34,630
I'm gonna put this in your goody-bag,
together with your...

753
01:12:35,003 --> 01:12:36,763
...leftovers.

754
01:12:38,506 --> 01:12:43,946
I'm setting up a timer. When it rings,
you can remove the bandages and leave.

755
01:12:44,346 --> 01:12:48,146
- But not before then, or you will...
- Go blind. I know.

756
01:12:48,475 --> 01:12:50,315
Don't scratch.

757
01:12:51,353 --> 01:12:55,913
A little something from
a mutual friend of ours.

758
01:13:32,813 --> 01:13:35,293
Don 't take the bandages off
for 12 hours.

759
01:13:36,358 --> 01:13:40,918
If you take them off before then,
you'll go blind. Understand?

760
01:14:01,802 --> 01:14:06,402
- 25. 16 seconds. That's a new record.
- Is that a world record?

761
01:14:06,765 --> 01:14:10,125
Is it a world record?
It's a personal best.

762
01:14:10,436 --> 01:14:13,356
- Now I wanna time you.
- You gotta be kidding.

763
01:14:13,648 --> 01:14:16,488
There's no way
I can beat 25. 16 seconds.

764
01:14:16,776 --> 01:14:19,496
How long can a whale hold its breath?

765
01:14:19,779 --> 01:14:21,859
For about 20 minutes.

766
01:14:22,115 --> 01:14:25,315
- So we gotta beat the whale.
- Okay.

767
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,482
We gotta beat the whale.

768
01:14:30,207 --> 01:14:31,487
Here you go.

769
01:14:31,708 --> 01:14:35,428
It's gonna be 20 minutes. You sure
you don't wanna go for an ice cream?

770
01:14:35,754 --> 01:14:38,634
Because you know
I'm gonna beat that whale.

771
01:14:39,174 --> 01:14:40,734
- Ready?
- Give me the count.

772
01:14:40,968 --> 01:14:43,128
Three, two, one, go!

773
01:15:00,947 --> 01:15:02,387
Sean?

774
01:15:05,243 --> 01:15:06,403
Sean?

775
01:15:09,414 --> 01:15:10,694
Sean.

776
01:15:17,256 --> 01:15:18,936
Have you seen...?

777
01:15:20,551 --> 01:15:24,871
I'm looking for my son. Have you
seen a boy in a red bathing suit?

778
01:15:26,724 --> 01:15:30,084
You seen my boy?
He's wearing a red bathing suit.

779
01:17:18,299 --> 01:17:23,019
Jad, we're ready to begin thermal scan
on all residences on North Powell.

780
01:17:24,264 --> 01:17:26,664
You must really like me, don't you?

781
01:17:26,933 --> 01:17:29,693
That's why you asked to partner
with me on this sortie.

782
01:17:29,978 --> 01:17:31,378
You're swell company.

783
01:17:31,604 --> 01:17:34,764
It's not that you don't trust me
to be alone with the chief, is it?

784
01:17:35,067 --> 01:17:37,227
That you think I might, you know,
futz with him?

785
01:17:37,485 --> 01:17:41,205
No, I just wanna watch him use your
body to sandblast another building.

786
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:42,532
Evanna, go.

787
01:17:43,034 --> 01:17:46,314
I show 27 warm bodies.

788
01:17:46,620 --> 01:17:49,340
Roger that. Confirmed, 27 warm bodies.

789
01:17:49,624 --> 01:17:54,384
- Four spyders, one per floor?
- Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

790
01:18:09,978 --> 01:18:14,978
Residents of 931 Powell, this is
Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime.

791
01:18:15,359 --> 01:18:20,439
Under authority of P.C. section 6409, we
are deploying spyders into your complex.

792
01:18:21,866 --> 01:18:24,146
Mom, I'm scared.

793
01:18:24,452 --> 01:18:26,852
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

794
01:18:27,121 --> 01:18:30,921
That's gonna scan you.
Keep your eyes open. Stay still.

795
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:33,011
- It's okay.
- I don't like it.

796
01:18:33,253 --> 01:18:35,253
Stay still. Stay still.

797
01:18:58,862 --> 01:18:59,982
Come on!

798
01:19:00,197 --> 01:19:02,677
You stepped out on me
for the last time.

799
01:19:02,950 --> 01:19:04,470
I told you where I was.

800
01:19:04,702 --> 01:19:07,502
You're a no-good liar.
I know you was with that ho.

801
01:19:07,788 --> 01:19:09,348
You're lucky we...

802
01:19:13,628 --> 01:19:15,628
Leave me alone!

803
01:20:32,044 --> 01:20:33,524
We lost one.

804
01:20:33,921 --> 01:20:37,721
Roger that. Maybe it was
a cat jumping through a window.

805
01:20:38,300 --> 01:20:39,900
It's an awful big cat.

806
01:20:40,135 --> 01:20:41,455
Fletcher.

807
01:20:42,513 --> 01:20:44,393
I'll go check it out.

808
01:21:22,930 --> 01:21:26,170
They're crying their eyes out.
You terrified them.

809
01:21:26,475 --> 01:21:28,595
Keep your kids away from me.

810
01:21:44,035 --> 01:21:48,235
The big cat's back. What do you think?
A drunk, maybe can't wake up?

811
01:21:48,582 --> 01:21:51,102
Or a guy who doesn't want to get read.

812
01:21:51,376 --> 01:21:53,856
Folks, be quiet, go back inside.

813
01:22:04,849 --> 01:22:06,969
Be quiet and close the door.

814
01:22:14,108 --> 01:22:16,308
We got an ID. It's not him.

815
01:22:18,322 --> 01:22:21,082
- Standing down.
- Let's eat.

816
01:22:34,589 --> 01:22:37,269
Fletcher, take a look.

817
01:22:39,051 --> 01:22:42,131
There's four people in this room,
not three.

818
01:22:42,430 --> 01:22:45,790
Four? There's Anderton, Crow
and the man in sunglasses.

819
01:22:46,101 --> 01:22:49,261
The man in the sunglasses
is outside the window.

820
01:22:51,857 --> 01:22:56,337
There's also someone here
in the mirror.

821
01:22:57,195 --> 01:22:59,235
Definitely female.

822
01:22:59,782 --> 01:23:03,862
The Precrime program began in 2046
with a federal grant.

823
01:23:04,203 --> 01:23:09,243
And now, nine years later,
D.C. is the safest city in America.

824
01:23:09,626 --> 01:23:11,906
Why? Because Precrime works.

825
01:23:12,169 --> 01:23:15,289
Precrime has eliminated the need
for conventional detectives.

826
01:23:15,590 --> 01:23:20,230
What happens now is the verification
and protection of future victims.

827
01:23:20,595 --> 01:23:22,155
Can we see the Pre-Cogs?

828
01:23:22,389 --> 01:23:26,709
They have such a powerful gift,
they're kept in peaceful seclusion...

829
01:23:27,060 --> 01:23:28,980
...so as not to be distracted.

830
01:23:29,229 --> 01:23:33,549
This display should give you some idea
of what their daily life is like.

831
01:23:34,485 --> 01:23:38,165
The Pre-Cogs get over
8 million letters every year.

832
01:23:38,489 --> 01:23:40,409
That's more than Santa Claus gets.

833
01:23:40,658 --> 01:23:44,178
Each Pre-Cog has their own bedroom,
TV and weight room.

834
01:23:44,495 --> 01:23:46,575
It's wonderful to be a Pre-Cog.

835
01:24:12,024 --> 01:24:14,504
My mom's new boyfriend
came over again last night.

836
01:24:14,819 --> 01:24:16,979
He's just not very intelligent.

837
01:24:17,237 --> 01:24:22,837
My mom wouldn't let me eat upstairs.
I had to listen to him go on and on.

838
01:24:31,795 --> 01:24:33,475
Shit!

839
01:24:51,398 --> 01:24:54,118
Eye-dent: John Anderton.
Approved for entry.

840
01:24:58,322 --> 01:25:02,082
- Which I told her I'd be able to do.
I'm so good at taking care of you.

841
01:25:02,410 --> 01:25:06,770
But she thinks I'll be irresponsible.
It's ridiculous because...

842
01:25:09,459 --> 01:25:13,099
You can't be in here.
What are you doing here?

843
01:25:17,718 --> 01:25:20,438
Easy there, old-timer.
Who cleared you?

844
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:22,680
- You're not allowed here.
- Listen, Wally.

845
01:25:22,931 --> 01:25:24,611
- Do I know you?
- I like you.

846
01:25:24,850 --> 01:25:27,810
So I don't wanna have
to kick you or hit you.

847
01:25:28,104 --> 01:25:30,504
But only if you promise to help me.

848
01:25:31,774 --> 01:25:33,614
Hi, John.

849
01:25:42,035 --> 01:25:44,355
Who does that look like to you?

850
01:25:45,955 --> 01:25:47,635
I don't know.

851
01:25:51,545 --> 01:25:55,665
It's Agatha.
He's coming here to get her.

852
01:25:58,010 --> 01:26:02,010
- Are these all of her previsions?
- I'm rewinding her right now.

853
01:26:03,974 --> 01:26:06,254
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

854
01:26:06,519 --> 01:26:10,759
They don't come out in any order.
I'm getting them as she's giving them.

855
01:26:14,027 --> 01:26:15,787
Can you see?

856
01:26:29,292 --> 01:26:32,012
- He's inside.
- He has some kind of mask on.

857
01:26:32,296 --> 01:26:34,176
- He sealed the door.
- Shit!

858
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:37,222
Nobody fires a weapon inside
the temple. Use bindfoam.

859
01:26:37,509 --> 01:26:40,829
- Is there another way out of there?
- All the doors are covered.

860
01:26:41,139 --> 01:26:46,539
John, move away from the tank.
Move away from the tank, John.

861
01:27:03,954 --> 01:27:05,794
What does he want with a Pre-Cog?

862
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:09,120
So he can kill whoever he wants to
without anyone knowing.

863
01:27:09,418 --> 01:27:14,458
Well, there's still the other two.
The other two can still function, right?

864
01:27:14,840 --> 01:27:20,880
They're a hive mind. It takes all three
for their predictive abilities to work.

865
01:27:23,265 --> 01:27:25,105
They can't see murders anymore?

866
01:27:25,351 --> 01:27:29,031
Agatha, she's the key.
She's the one they listen to...

867
01:27:29,356 --> 01:27:31,476
...the one with the most talent.

868
01:27:31,733 --> 01:27:35,013
- She takes care of the other two.
- Jesus.

869
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:39,240
- Please bring her back.
- Every team underground, now!

870
01:27:39,574 --> 01:27:42,534
- It doesn't matter. He wins.
- We'll stop him.

871
01:27:42,828 --> 01:27:47,508
She's with him when he kills Crow.
She's already a part of his future.

872
01:27:47,874 --> 01:27:51,114
Jad, put everything you've got into
finding that room, and we stop a murder.

873
01:27:51,420 --> 01:27:54,540
- How much time have we got, Gordon?
- We've got...

874
01:27:55,008 --> 01:27:57,448
...51 minutes, 30 seconds.

875
01:27:59,721 --> 01:28:02,601
You cold? Can you understand me?

876
01:28:02,891 --> 01:28:06,691
Are you cold? The shivers,
it's the drugs we gave you.

877
01:28:07,020 --> 01:28:11,140
It should wear off soon.
I'm sorry. I need your help.

878
01:28:11,482 --> 01:28:15,122
You contain information.
I need to know how to get at it.

879
01:28:16,321 --> 01:28:19,161
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?

880
01:28:19,450 --> 01:28:21,250
- Is it now?
- What?

881
01:28:21,493 --> 01:28:23,253
Is it now?

882
01:28:24,955 --> 01:28:28,315
Yes, this is all happening right now.

883
01:28:29,168 --> 01:28:31,288
I'm taking you some place in public...

884
01:28:31,545 --> 01:28:34,265
...which means you need
something else to wear.

885
01:28:34,549 --> 01:28:38,429
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.

886
01:28:44,350 --> 01:28:47,430
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto,
welcome back to the Gap.

887
01:28:47,729 --> 01:28:50,929
How'd those assorted tank tops
work out for you?

888
01:28:51,400 --> 01:28:53,520
Mr. Yakamoto?

889
01:28:57,740 --> 01:29:03,140
Miss Belfor, did you come back for
another pair of those chammy lace-ups?

890
01:29:17,260 --> 01:29:21,420
- If it's ransom, where's the damn note?
- It has nothing to do with ransom.

891
01:29:21,765 --> 01:29:25,405
It has to do with the information
inside of Agatha.

892
01:29:26,686 --> 01:29:31,086
- He's trying to prove his innocence.
- He can't download her without support.

893
01:29:31,442 --> 01:29:33,922
Your average consumer can't buy
any of this stuff.

894
01:29:34,194 --> 01:29:38,514
It's been assembled and scrounged
from spare parts made to order.

895
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:43,509
Assuming Anderton ordered this,
who put it together?

896
01:29:53,089 --> 01:29:56,049
Who's Rufus T. Riley?

897
01:29:58,303 --> 01:30:01,063
What's your pleasure? We got it
all here: Sports fantasies...

898
01:30:01,348 --> 01:30:03,388
..."Look, Ma, I can fly" fantasies...

899
01:30:03,642 --> 01:30:07,602
...which covers everything from bungee
jumping to flying over the Grand Canyon.

900
01:30:07,938 --> 01:30:10,298
You can experience sex as a woman.

901
01:30:10,566 --> 01:30:14,286
Women come in to get laid
by their favorite soap star.

902
01:30:14,611 --> 01:30:17,331
Or just some good, clean fun.

903
01:30:20,076 --> 01:30:22,956
It's a big rush, but you come out
without a heart attack.

904
01:30:23,245 --> 01:30:25,965
I wanna kill my boss.

905
01:30:27,584 --> 01:30:28,704
Okay.

906
01:30:29,378 --> 01:30:33,178
- You got some images I can work with?
- Rufus.

907
01:30:33,673 --> 01:30:36,993
Yeah, being concertmaster
for the Philadelphia Symphony...

908
01:30:37,303 --> 01:30:38,983
...is a popular choice.

909
01:30:39,221 --> 01:30:41,901
- I wanna kill my boss.
- You sick bastard.

910
01:30:42,182 --> 01:30:44,982
You make this a terrible world
to live in!

911
01:30:45,269 --> 01:30:49,269
Detective, nice of you to come here,
seeing how every cop is looking for you.

912
01:30:49,607 --> 01:30:52,167
- I need your help.
- Why'd you come here?

913
01:30:52,443 --> 01:30:55,523
- I make house calls.
- I need your help with her.

914
01:30:55,821 --> 01:30:59,301
Hello, honey pie.
I'm impressed. You're on the lam...

915
01:30:59,659 --> 01:31:03,699
...and you still have the time to
slice off a little... jerky for yourself.

916
01:31:04,038 --> 01:31:07,118
- She's a Pre-Cog.
- Oh, yeah, okay.

917
01:31:07,417 --> 01:31:09,577
- That's right.
- She's a Pre-Cog.

918
01:31:11,463 --> 01:31:14,743
You brought a Pre-Cog here.

919
01:31:28,814 --> 01:31:30,734
Jesus Christ.

920
01:31:31,317 --> 01:31:34,117
- Are you reading my mind right now?
- Get up.

921
01:31:34,612 --> 01:31:39,812
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do.
I swear I didn't do that stuff I did.

922
01:31:42,412 --> 01:31:46,252
She has information inside her.
I need you to get it out.

923
01:31:46,583 --> 01:31:49,663
No way. I wouldn't even know
where to begin.

924
01:31:49,962 --> 01:31:53,282
Those thoughts about my cousin
were just thoughts.

925
01:31:53,590 --> 01:31:55,910
- You've been busted for felony hacking.
- So?

926
01:31:56,177 --> 01:31:58,497
So I need you to hack into her.

927
01:32:01,640 --> 01:32:06,480
I do this, I get to keep
whatever images I get from her head.

928
01:32:06,855 --> 01:32:10,575
- They don't belong to anybody.
- Take her to RadioShack.

929
01:32:12,360 --> 01:32:13,760
You're gonna help me.

930
01:32:20,243 --> 01:32:24,643
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see
what's gonna happen to me.

931
01:32:26,041 --> 01:32:27,721
And then we'll go.

932
01:32:42,725 --> 01:32:45,165
- She works.
- Slow it down.

933
01:32:46,396 --> 01:32:50,036
How do I slow this down?
I should hit her on the head?

934
01:32:56,072 --> 01:32:59,032
- Are you recording this?
- Shit.

935
01:32:59,743 --> 01:33:01,463
Yeah, recording.

936
01:33:28,065 --> 01:33:30,585
I know this already.
Come on. Move on.

937
01:33:33,904 --> 01:33:35,464
Goodbye, Crow.

938
01:33:36,407 --> 01:33:37,967
Goodbye, Crow.

939
01:33:46,083 --> 01:33:48,203
- What happened?
- I don't know.

940
01:33:48,461 --> 01:33:50,061
- What happened?
- I don't...

941
01:33:50,296 --> 01:33:53,576
- Where's the rest of it?
- I guess that's all of it.

942
01:33:55,092 --> 01:33:58,932
Where's my Minority Report?

943
01:34:00,474 --> 01:34:02,794
Do I even have one?

944
01:34:07,648 --> 01:34:10,688
- Do I have one?
- No.

945
01:34:12,486 --> 01:34:14,926
- What?
- No.

946
01:34:22,830 --> 01:34:24,150
What?

947
01:34:24,415 --> 01:34:27,455
Agatha? What? What?

948
01:34:27,793 --> 01:34:30,513
- Can you see?
- See what?

949
01:34:46,688 --> 01:34:48,488
Anne Lively.

950
01:34:56,449 --> 01:35:00,929
You want me to see who killed
Anne Lively. Are you recording this?

951
01:35:01,287 --> 01:35:04,167
Yeah, but it's pouring
out of her backwards.

952
01:35:09,587 --> 01:35:12,067
I like my life. Everything's good.

953
01:35:23,310 --> 01:35:24,950
They're inside.

954
01:35:25,604 --> 01:35:27,164
Who?

955
01:35:28,232 --> 01:35:30,032
All your old teammates.

956
01:35:31,109 --> 01:35:33,869
Kenny, left chamber.
Alan, straight across.

957
01:35:34,155 --> 01:35:35,155
Negative!

958
01:35:36,324 --> 01:35:37,724
- Negative!
- Negative!

959
01:35:37,951 --> 01:35:39,391
I don't deserve that.

960
01:35:39,618 --> 01:35:42,018
- You are the man.
- No, you're the man.

961
01:35:48,920 --> 01:35:51,080
Can you see the umbrella?

962
01:35:51,715 --> 01:35:53,315
Take it.

963
01:35:53,592 --> 01:35:55,192
Take it!

964
01:35:59,348 --> 01:36:03,708
A man in a blue suit.
He drops his briefcase.

965
01:36:11,109 --> 01:36:14,949
You see a woman in a brown dress.
She knows your face.

966
01:36:16,574 --> 01:36:18,414
Turn in here.

967
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:26,645
Let's go.

968
01:36:32,215 --> 01:36:34,135
- Wait.
- No, we can't stop here.

969
01:36:34,385 --> 01:36:36,385
Can you see the balloon man?

970
01:36:38,680 --> 01:36:40,080
Wait.

971
01:36:42,894 --> 01:36:46,534
- Wait.
- What are we waiting for?

972
01:36:51,735 --> 01:36:53,855
Wait. Wait.

973
01:36:54,405 --> 01:36:55,925
Wait.

974
01:36:56,407 --> 01:36:59,567
- Please, Mommy, can I have one?
- All right.

975
01:37:02,121 --> 01:37:03,121
Wait.

976
01:37:08,336 --> 01:37:10,176
Thank you.

977
01:37:10,714 --> 01:37:13,714
- Anybody got an ID? Anybody?
- Negative.

978
01:37:14,009 --> 01:37:18,329
Scott, Ramos, take the east end.
Everyone else, follow me. Let's go.

979
01:37:30,235 --> 01:37:32,755
He knows. Don't go home.

980
01:37:41,329 --> 01:37:42,649
We've got eyes on.

981
01:37:42,872 --> 01:37:45,432
They're working,
but they're standing on it.

982
01:37:45,709 --> 01:37:48,509
Please! Please!
Have you got a quarter?

983
01:37:48,795 --> 01:37:50,675
Drop some money.

984
01:37:52,967 --> 01:37:55,807
Can't you put it in my hand?

985
01:37:56,095 --> 01:37:58,615
May the Lord bless you.

986
01:37:58,889 --> 01:38:02,409
May God take care of you.

987
01:38:22,414 --> 01:38:23,534
Damn!

988
01:38:52,362 --> 01:38:55,802
That's the guy.
The man in the window.

989
01:39:12,216 --> 01:39:15,976
- Rooms are 95 a night.
- Mind if I look at the registry?

990
01:39:16,304 --> 01:39:17,984
I mind.

991
01:39:18,472 --> 01:39:19,752
How about now?

992
01:39:20,057 --> 01:39:21,857
Help yourself.

993
01:39:35,490 --> 01:39:36,890
He's here.

994
01:39:37,534 --> 01:39:39,574
Anderton, leave.

995
01:39:46,544 --> 01:39:49,384
You have a choice.
Walk away. Do it now.

996
01:39:49,672 --> 01:39:53,192
I can't. I have to find out
what happened in my life.

997
01:39:53,509 --> 01:39:54,629
Please.

998
01:39:54,844 --> 01:39:58,844
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man.
I don't even know him.

999
01:39:59,182 --> 01:40:01,302
- What room is Crow in?
- 1006.

1000
01:40:02,269 --> 01:40:03,789
Come on.

1001
01:40:04,146 --> 01:40:05,306
Come on.

1002
01:41:24,605 --> 01:41:26,285
Wrong room.

1003
01:41:55,137 --> 01:41:56,617
Leave.

1004
01:41:57,139 --> 01:41:58,539
Leave.

1005
01:42:55,158 --> 01:42:56,558
Oh, God.

1006
01:43:01,414 --> 01:43:02,654
This is Sean.

1007
01:43:03,333 --> 01:43:04,973
My son.

1008
01:43:09,214 --> 01:43:14,734
Every day for the last six years
I've thought about only two things:

1009
01:43:16,221 --> 01:43:20,461
The first is what my son would
look like if he were alive today...

1010
01:43:21,686 --> 01:43:25,326
...if I would recognize him
if I saw him on the street.

1011
01:43:29,069 --> 01:43:32,629
And the second is what I would do
to the man who took him.

1012
01:43:37,661 --> 01:43:39,221
You're right.

1013
01:43:40,705 --> 01:43:42,345
I'm not being set up.

1014
01:43:45,586 --> 01:43:47,946
You have to take me home.

1015
01:43:53,678 --> 01:43:57,478
You said so yourself.
There is no Minority Report.

1016
01:43:57,807 --> 01:44:00,447
I don't have an alternate future.

1017
01:44:01,770 --> 01:44:04,170
I am going to kill this man.

1018
01:44:06,983 --> 01:44:11,103
You still have a choice.
The others never saw their future.

1019
01:44:11,446 --> 01:44:13,966
You still have a choice.

1020
01:44:14,991 --> 01:44:17,391
- Leo Crow?
- Who the hell are you?

1021
01:44:23,584 --> 01:44:25,024
Six years ago, Baltimore...

1022
01:44:25,252 --> 01:44:28,892
...you grabbed a kid at Francis
public pool on the West End.

1023
01:44:29,298 --> 01:44:33,418
Did I? I don't remember
anything about that place.

1024
01:44:37,682 --> 01:44:39,442
Who am I? Who am I?

1025
01:44:39,684 --> 01:44:41,604
Do you know who I am?

1026
01:44:41,853 --> 01:44:45,253
- You're somebody's father.
- His name is Sean!

1027
01:44:47,442 --> 01:44:48,442
Sean!

1028
01:44:49,361 --> 01:44:52,321
I told him I was a policeman
and needed his help.

1029
01:44:52,614 --> 01:44:57,454
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song.
I bought him a pretzel.

1030
01:44:57,828 --> 01:44:59,868
He was happy. He was happy.

1031
01:45:00,372 --> 01:45:03,172
Is he alive?
He's alive. Where have you got him?

1032
01:45:03,459 --> 01:45:06,659
Is he all right?
Tell me, you fuck, where is he?!

1033
01:45:06,963 --> 01:45:10,843
I put him in a barrel.
I sunk him in the bay.

1034
01:45:11,175 --> 01:45:14,175
He floated back up. I took him out.

1035
01:45:14,512 --> 01:45:17,552
I was gentle. I was gentle.

1036
01:45:18,683 --> 01:45:20,403
I was gentle.

1037
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:26,640
I'm sorry.

1038
01:45:26,900 --> 01:45:28,020
I'm sorry.

1039
01:45:28,277 --> 01:45:29,437
I'm sorry.

1040
01:45:29,653 --> 01:45:30,773
I'm sorry.

1041
01:45:31,030 --> 01:45:33,430
I'm so very sorry.

1042
01:45:35,784 --> 01:45:38,104
How could you do that to my...?

1043
01:46:10,654 --> 01:46:12,814
You can choose.

1044
01:46:16,535 --> 01:46:18,175
You can choose.

1045
01:46:36,973 --> 01:46:39,573
You have the right to remain silent.

1046
01:46:39,976 --> 01:46:44,456
Anything you say or do can be used
against you in a court of law.

1047
01:46:45,315 --> 01:46:47,715
You have the right to an attorney...

1048
01:46:48,027 --> 01:46:52,227
...now and during any
further questioning.

1049
01:46:52,615 --> 01:46:55,335
If you can't afford an attorney...

1050
01:46:57,620 --> 01:46:59,580
...we will appoint one.

1051
01:47:01,457 --> 01:47:04,097
Do you understand these rights?

1052
01:47:05,170 --> 01:47:07,290
You're not gonna kill me?

1053
01:47:10,174 --> 01:47:14,294
- Do you understand these rights?
- You're not gonna kill me?

1054
01:47:17,349 --> 01:47:21,229
If you don't go through with this,
my family gets nothing.

1055
01:47:21,562 --> 01:47:25,722
You're supposed to kill me.
He said you would.

1056
01:47:27,151 --> 01:47:29,351
He? Who's he?

1057
01:47:29,612 --> 01:47:32,372
I don't know.
He called me in my cell.

1058
01:47:32,657 --> 01:47:36,777
He told me I'd be released if I went
along, and my family would be cared for.

1059
01:47:37,120 --> 01:47:38,720
If you did what?

1060
01:47:38,955 --> 01:47:40,275
If you did what?

1061
01:47:41,999 --> 01:47:45,359
If I acted like I killed your kid.
Okay?

1062
01:47:47,255 --> 01:47:49,295
If you killed my kid?

1063
01:47:49,550 --> 01:47:53,190
Look, you don't kill me,
my family gets nothing. Okay?

1064
01:47:53,971 --> 01:47:56,171
What about the pictures?

1065
01:47:56,974 --> 01:48:00,774
They're fake. He gave them to me.

1066
01:48:01,312 --> 01:48:03,672
Now, listen to me. You...

1067
01:48:03,981 --> 01:48:06,901
You tell me:
Who was it that set this up?

1068
01:48:08,235 --> 01:48:10,115
I don't know.

1069
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:12,530
- Come on.
- I'm asking you again:

1070
01:48:12,782 --> 01:48:15,862
- Who put you up to this?
- I didn't see his face.

1071
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:17,920
I tell you who,
and my family gets nothing.

1072
01:48:18,163 --> 01:48:20,283
- Who made you do this?
- Kill me.

1073
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:22,780
- You can do this. Kill me.
- Tell me.

1074
01:48:23,042 --> 01:48:26,082
- Kill me.
- Leo, let go of the gun.

1075
01:48:26,380 --> 01:48:28,700
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1076
01:48:30,967 --> 01:48:34,887
Let go of the gun. That's it.
Let go of the gun.

1077
01:48:36,390 --> 01:48:38,390
You're not gonna kill me.

1078
01:48:39,101 --> 01:48:41,461
- Goodbye, Crow.
- Anderton, wait a sec...!

1079
01:48:55,660 --> 01:48:57,540
- Did you see it?
- Stay back!

1080
01:48:57,787 --> 01:48:59,987
What's happening down there?

1081
01:49:01,125 --> 01:49:02,645
Murder!

1082
01:49:03,002 --> 01:49:04,922
Murder!

1083
01:49:06,797 --> 01:49:08,197
Doesn't make sense.

1084
01:49:08,424 --> 01:49:12,344
If you were a child killer,
would you leave these photos out?

1085
01:49:12,678 --> 01:49:14,678
Anderton might have found them.

1086
01:49:14,930 --> 01:49:17,730
- What kind of cop were you before this?
- Treasury agent.

1087
01:49:18,017 --> 01:49:22,017
This will be your first murder scene?
I worked homicide before federal.

1088
01:49:22,355 --> 01:49:24,315
This is an orgy of evidence.

1089
01:49:24,566 --> 01:49:28,446
- Know how many orgies I had as a cop?
- How many?

1090
01:49:28,778 --> 01:49:30,058
None.

1091
01:49:35,244 --> 01:49:37,084
This was all arranged.

1092
01:49:37,329 --> 01:49:42,249
Today we saw the first murder in the
six years of the Precrime experiment.

1093
01:49:42,626 --> 01:49:45,186
Sadly enough, this failure was human.

1094
01:49:45,462 --> 01:49:48,662
The protection team
simply didn't get there in time.

1095
01:49:48,966 --> 01:49:53,806
But the murder itself happened exactly
as the Pre-Cogs predicted it would.

1096
01:49:54,180 --> 01:49:57,980
Today's event put a human face
on the Precrime system.

1097
01:49:58,309 --> 01:50:02,509
Danny Witwer's on the phone.
He says it's important.

1098
01:50:04,816 --> 01:50:06,416
Lamar?

1099
01:50:13,617 --> 01:50:15,617
- What?
- There's something wrong.

1100
01:50:15,911 --> 01:50:19,831
We're chasing the wrong man.
I don 't wanna say over the phone.

1101
01:50:20,165 --> 01:50:21,845
Meet me at Anderton 's.

1102
01:50:22,084 --> 01:50:25,124
We recovered that
from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1103
01:50:30,802 --> 01:50:34,202
I remember when I gave this
to him, back in Baltimore.

1104
01:50:35,681 --> 01:50:37,281
Please, sir.

1105
01:50:40,270 --> 01:50:41,630
Tell me what you have.

1106
01:50:46,735 --> 01:50:50,095
This is the murder of a woman
named Anne Lively.

1107
01:50:51,657 --> 01:50:55,497
John told me about this.
You got this from Containment?

1108
01:50:55,828 --> 01:50:58,748
Yes. This is from the twins,
Arthur and Dashiell.

1109
01:50:59,039 --> 01:51:01,239
Agatha's stream was missing.

1110
01:51:02,877 --> 01:51:05,317
This one is from the Cyber Parlor.

1111
01:51:05,587 --> 01:51:10,507
Anderton downloaded this directly
from Agatha. Rufus Riley recorded it.

1112
01:51:13,262 --> 01:51:16,902
- It's the same prevision.
- Not quite.

1113
01:51:18,727 --> 01:51:23,087
Look at the surface wind
across the water. Watch the ripples.

1114
01:51:23,607 --> 01:51:26,367
Moving away from shore.

1115
01:51:27,736 --> 01:51:32,376
Now the second image, the one from
Containment that Art and Dash saw.

1116
01:51:32,908 --> 01:51:34,708
Watch the water.

1117
01:51:35,995 --> 01:51:40,835
The wind's changed.
The ripples are moving the other way.

1118
01:51:42,251 --> 01:51:45,611
This murder's taking place
at two different times.

1119
01:51:45,921 --> 01:51:49,401
Anderton was watching this
right before he was tagged.

1120
01:51:49,717 --> 01:51:52,597
He told me about
the missing data stream.

1121
01:51:52,888 --> 01:51:56,608
- He was concerned you might find it.
- He was right. I did.

1122
01:51:56,933 --> 01:51:58,533
It was inside of Agatha.

1123
01:51:58,769 --> 01:52:03,649
So the question is, why would someone
want this erased from the data file?

1124
01:52:04,024 --> 01:52:08,064
Danny, just tell me
what you're thinking.

1125
01:52:08,446 --> 01:52:11,286
I'm thinking someone
got away with murder.

1126
01:52:12,074 --> 01:52:13,194
How?

1127
01:52:13,617 --> 01:52:17,977
Jad told me that sometimes the Pre-Cogs
see the same murder more than once.

1128
01:52:18,330 --> 01:52:22,050
- It's called an echo.
- Jad called it Pre-Cog deja vu.

1129
01:52:22,377 --> 01:52:25,817
We teach the techs to identify
and disregard them.

1130
01:52:26,422 --> 01:52:31,542
Yeah, but what if a technician only
thought he was looking at an echo?

1131
01:52:31,928 --> 01:52:36,488
What if he was looking at a completely
different murder altogether?

1132
01:52:36,850 --> 01:52:38,410
I don't understand.

1133
01:52:38,769 --> 01:52:40,969
All you'd have to do is hire someone
to kill Anne Lively...

1134
01:52:41,230 --> 01:52:44,750
...like a drifter, a neuroin addict,
someone with nothing to lose.

1135
01:52:45,067 --> 01:52:47,867
Precrime stops the murder
from taking place...

1136
01:52:48,154 --> 01:52:52,874
...haloes the killer, takes him away.
But then, right then, someone else...

1137
01:52:53,242 --> 01:52:57,162
...having reviewed the prevision
and dressed in the same clothes...

1138
01:52:57,497 --> 01:53:01,137
...commits the murder
in exactly the same way.

1139
01:53:01,459 --> 01:53:06,619
Technician takes a look, thinks he's
looking at an echo, erases it.

1140
01:53:11,345 --> 01:53:15,985
It'd have to be someone with access
to the previsions in the first place.

1141
01:53:16,349 --> 01:53:18,349
Someone fairly high-up.

1142
01:53:20,604 --> 01:53:22,604
Do you know what I hear?

1143
01:53:24,358 --> 01:53:27,598
Nothing.
No footsteps up the stairs.

1144
01:53:27,904 --> 01:53:32,024
No hovercraft out the window.
No clickety-click of little spyders.

1145
01:53:32,366 --> 01:53:33,766
Do you know why?

1146
01:53:33,993 --> 01:53:37,273
Because right now,
the Pre-Cogs can't see a thing.

1147
01:54:02,315 --> 01:54:05,555
Can you see? It's beautiful.

1148
01:54:06,110 --> 01:54:09,430
- Where are we going?
- Someplace safe.

1149
01:54:16,913 --> 01:54:18,793
- Burgess.
- Lamar, it's Lara.

1150
01:54:19,041 --> 01:54:21,481
- Yes, Lara.
- You have to help him.

1151
01:54:22,752 --> 01:54:23,792
Is he there?

1152
01:54:26,340 --> 01:54:27,860
Is the Pre-Cog with him?

1153
01:54:31,929 --> 01:54:34,409
Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1154
01:54:34,682 --> 01:54:38,122
Please don't tell Danny Witwer.
I don't trust him.

1155
01:54:39,604 --> 01:54:41,764
I won't say a word.

1156
01:54:42,732 --> 01:54:46,452
You just don't let John leave,
all right?

1157
01:54:48,238 --> 01:54:49,878
He's no killer, Lamar.

1158
01:54:50,574 --> 01:54:51,734
I know.

1159
01:55:03,503 --> 01:55:04,943
It's cold.

1160
01:55:10,010 --> 01:55:12,890
Lara, this is Agatha.

1161
01:55:18,144 --> 01:55:23,264
You remember when I would read
Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?

1162
01:55:26,319 --> 01:55:31,519
He got so scared when Tom and Becky
were lost in the cave.

1163
01:55:34,202 --> 01:55:36,442
I gotta sit down.

1164
01:55:37,331 --> 01:55:39,411
I gotta figure this out.

1165
01:55:40,000 --> 01:55:42,160
I gotta figure this out.

1166
01:56:21,711 --> 01:56:23,551
They used Sean.

1167
01:56:25,381 --> 01:56:28,101
They wanted me to think
Crow killed him.

1168
01:56:29,386 --> 01:56:30,866
But he didn't.

1169
01:56:32,513 --> 01:56:33,873
He didn't.

1170
01:56:35,684 --> 01:56:38,124
Why would they set you up?

1171
01:56:45,819 --> 01:56:48,619
Because I found out about her.

1172
01:56:49,656 --> 01:56:51,376
About who?

1173
01:56:51,659 --> 01:56:55,299
- How could I not have seen this?
- Seen what?

1174
01:56:56,664 --> 01:56:58,664
Anne Lively.

1175
01:57:01,252 --> 01:57:02,692
Agatha.

1176
01:57:07,467 --> 01:57:10,467
Dr. Hineman once said,
"The dead don't die...

1177
01:57:10,762 --> 01:57:12,762
...they look on and help. "

1178
01:57:13,598 --> 01:57:15,758
Remember that, John.

1179
01:57:16,935 --> 01:57:18,055
Agatha.

1180
01:57:18,270 --> 01:57:19,830
Sean.

1181
01:57:24,026 --> 01:57:26,386
He's on the beach now...

1182
01:57:27,112 --> 01:57:29,272
...toe in the water.

1183
01:57:30,449 --> 01:57:33,169
He's asking you to come in with him.

1184
01:57:33,953 --> 01:57:37,193
He's been racing his mother
up and down the sand.

1185
01:57:39,125 --> 01:57:41,885
There's so much love in this house.

1186
01:57:47,008 --> 01:57:48,848
He's 10 years old.

1187
01:57:51,346 --> 01:57:53,906
He's surrounded by animals.

1188
01:57:55,267 --> 01:57:57,467
He wants to be a vet.

1189
01:57:59,397 --> 01:58:03,957
You keep a rabbit for him,
a bird and a fox.

1190
01:58:05,653 --> 01:58:07,413
He's in high school.

1191
01:58:07,988 --> 01:58:10,708
He likes to run, like his father.

1192
01:58:11,325 --> 01:58:14,525
He runs the two-mile
and the long relay.

1193
01:58:15,996 --> 01:58:17,676
He's 23.

1194
01:58:19,167 --> 01:58:21,327
He's at a university.

1195
01:58:21,878 --> 01:58:24,958
He makes love
to a pretty girl named Claire.

1196
01:58:25,256 --> 01:58:27,616
He asks her to be his wife.

1197
01:58:28,343 --> 01:58:31,823
He calls here and tells Lara,
who cries.

1198
01:58:33,598 --> 01:58:35,518
He still runs...

1199
01:58:35,809 --> 01:58:39,889
...across the university and
in the stadium, where John watches.

1200
01:58:40,272 --> 01:58:44,632
Oh, God. He's running so fast,
just like his daddy.

1201
01:58:45,403 --> 01:58:49,443
He sees his daddy.
He wants to run to him.

1202
01:58:51,075 --> 01:58:55,475
But he's only 6 years old,
and he can't do it.

1203
01:58:56,164 --> 01:58:58,404
And the other man is so fast.

1204
01:59:02,337 --> 01:59:04,977
There was so much love in this house.

1205
01:59:06,341 --> 01:59:08,581
I want him back so bad.

1206
01:59:11,180 --> 01:59:12,900
So did she.

1207
01:59:13,682 --> 01:59:15,322
Can't you see?

1208
01:59:19,230 --> 01:59:22,310
She just wanted her little girl back.

1209
01:59:24,610 --> 01:59:26,770
But it was too late.

1210
01:59:28,531 --> 01:59:30,931
Her little girl was already gone.

1211
01:59:31,784 --> 01:59:33,304
She's still alive.

1212
01:59:34,996 --> 01:59:36,796
She didn't die.

1213
01:59:37,290 --> 01:59:39,130
But she's not alive.

1214
01:59:41,044 --> 01:59:42,484
Agatha?

1215
01:59:45,174 --> 01:59:46,494
Just tell me...

1216
01:59:47,134 --> 01:59:49,134
...who killed your mother?

1217
01:59:49,887 --> 01:59:51,927
Who killed Anne Lively?

1218
01:59:53,640 --> 01:59:58,360
I'm sorry, John,
but you're gonna have to run again.

1219
01:59:59,355 --> 02:00:01,435
- What?
- Run!

1220
02:00:18,374 --> 02:00:19,974
I love you.

1221
02:00:20,919 --> 02:00:23,599
- It's okay.
- You'll be fine with them.

1222
02:00:23,881 --> 02:00:26,561
- No! No!
- Stay with me. Stay with me.

1223
02:00:26,842 --> 02:00:29,202
- John, no.
- Don't talk.

1224
02:00:46,780 --> 02:00:48,060
John Anderton.

1225
02:00:49,408 --> 02:00:52,488
By mandate of the D.C.
Precrime Division...

1226
02:00:52,786 --> 02:00:57,746
...I'm placing you under arrest for the
murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1227
02:01:01,128 --> 02:01:02,688
That's it.

1228
02:01:03,172 --> 02:01:04,852
That's my girl.

1229
02:01:06,758 --> 02:01:08,958
I was so worried about you.

1230
02:01:13,099 --> 02:01:14,819
Did he hurt you?

1231
02:01:17,937 --> 02:01:19,497
I missed you so much.

1232
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:21,891
It's okay. Wally's here.

1233
02:01:22,693 --> 02:01:24,053
Wally's here.

1234
02:01:29,283 --> 02:01:32,563
You're a part of my flock now, John.

1235
02:01:32,911 --> 02:01:34,351
Welcome.

1236
02:01:35,372 --> 02:01:39,732
It's actually kind of a rush.
They say you have visions...

1237
02:01:40,085 --> 02:01:43,045
...that your life flashes
before your eyes...

1238
02:01:43,339 --> 02:01:46,659
...that all your dreams come true.

1239
02:02:03,568 --> 02:02:05,768
This is all my fault.

1240
02:02:06,863 --> 02:02:09,343
There was nothing anyone could do.

1241
02:02:13,871 --> 02:02:16,551
I thought you might want
to have those.

1242
02:02:22,463 --> 02:02:27,343
I haven't worn this in years. I wanted
to make sure it fits before tonight.

1243
02:02:27,719 --> 02:02:28,999
You look great.

1244
02:02:29,220 --> 02:02:33,300
I knew he was having trouble
for some time, yet I did nothing.

1245
02:02:33,642 --> 02:02:37,042
- The guy from USA Today is here.
- Tell him not now.

1246
02:02:37,353 --> 02:02:40,673
- He just wanted a few minutes before...
- Not now!

1247
02:02:43,360 --> 02:02:46,760
- I thought you were retiring.
- Well, I was.

1248
02:02:47,114 --> 02:02:52,634
But this incident with John made me
realize the fragility of all this.

1249
02:02:53,412 --> 02:02:56,612
This is John's legacy
as much as it is my own.

1250
02:02:57,542 --> 02:03:00,862
Now I have an obligation
to protect that.

1251
02:03:01,545 --> 02:03:04,945
Lara, I know how difficult
this is for you.

1252
02:03:05,258 --> 02:03:08,498
But maybe you can find
some closure in the fact...

1253
02:03:08,803 --> 02:03:13,083
...that John finally found
the man who killed your son.

1254
02:03:16,103 --> 02:03:17,383
Who's Anne Lively?

1255
02:03:20,274 --> 02:03:22,634
- Who?
- Anne Lively.

1256
02:03:23,194 --> 02:03:26,954
John was talking about her
right before they took him.

1257
02:03:27,281 --> 02:03:29,361
I don't know who that is.

1258
02:03:30,618 --> 02:03:35,618
John said something about him being
set up because he found out about her.

1259
02:03:35,998 --> 02:03:40,758
- Well, we know why John was tagged.
- He also said Crow was a fake.

1260
02:03:41,128 --> 02:03:45,488
And Witwer? He was killed with
John's gun inside John's apartment.

1261
02:03:45,842 --> 02:03:49,882
Do you know the reason why
John came here to work for you?

1262
02:03:50,221 --> 02:03:51,541
- Sean.
- Yes.

1263
02:03:52,390 --> 02:03:55,550
He came here to work for you
because he thought...

1264
02:03:55,853 --> 02:04:00,293
...if he could just stop
that kind of thing from happening...

1265
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:04,230
- I understand.
- No, I don't think you do.

1266
02:04:04,529 --> 02:04:09,089
Sir, they wanna start
the press conference in two minutes.

1267
02:04:09,450 --> 02:04:10,570
Lara...

1268
02:04:11,077 --> 02:04:13,837
...John was the best cop I ever knew...

1269
02:04:14,163 --> 02:04:16,883
...and, in some ways,
also the best man.

1270
02:04:17,166 --> 02:04:19,526
But the scars he carried around...

1271
02:04:19,795 --> 02:04:24,955
Well, I know he'd want us to honor
the good things we remember about him.

1272
02:04:25,342 --> 02:04:30,782
And I also know why he married you:
You're as stubborn as he is.

1273
02:04:31,181 --> 02:04:35,381
- Lamar...
- Do you know how to tie one of these?

1274
02:04:35,728 --> 02:04:39,968
Could you please give me a hand?
I'm all thumbs, as you see.

1275
02:04:47,990 --> 02:04:50,670
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1276
02:04:50,952 --> 02:04:55,072
First thing Monday,
I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

1277
02:04:55,415 --> 02:04:58,935
And I'll have Gideon
run the Containment files...

1278
02:04:59,252 --> 02:05:02,172
...see if anyone drowned a woman
by the name of...

1279
02:05:02,463 --> 02:05:05,143
What did you say her name was?

1280
02:05:07,344 --> 02:05:08,984
Anne Lively.

1281
02:05:09,680 --> 02:05:12,120
But I never said she drowned.

1282
02:05:32,078 --> 02:05:36,718
- Sir, the press conference is starting.
- I'll be right there.

1283
02:05:41,589 --> 02:05:43,909
We'll talk about this later.

1284
02:05:44,758 --> 02:05:49,158
Perhaps tomorrow,
I'll come by the cottage.

1285
02:06:26,093 --> 02:06:28,533
I'd like a word with my husband.

1286
02:06:29,347 --> 02:06:32,267
You're not authorized.

1287
02:06:32,600 --> 02:06:35,200
How did you get in here?

1288
02:06:43,987 --> 02:06:45,267
Thank you.

1289
02:06:45,489 --> 02:06:50,609
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess,
director of the new National Precrime.

1290
02:06:53,455 --> 02:06:57,175
On behalf of your staff,
we present you with this.

1291
02:06:57,501 --> 02:07:01,181
- Congratulations, sir.
- My God.

1292
02:07:02,465 --> 02:07:03,905
How did you get this?

1293
02:07:04,133 --> 02:07:07,133
I padded your expense account
for six months.

1294
02:07:09,681 --> 02:07:13,361
Revolvers like this one
were given to generals...

1295
02:07:13,684 --> 02:07:16,724
...at the end of the Civil War
by their troops.

1296
02:07:17,022 --> 02:07:20,822
The cylinders were loaded
with five gold-plated bullets...

1297
02:07:21,150 --> 02:07:24,310
...to symbolize the end
of the destruction and death...

1298
02:07:24,613 --> 02:07:27,013
...that had ripped the country apart
for five years.

1299
02:07:27,283 --> 02:07:30,643
Ladies and gentlemen,
with Precrime going national...

1300
02:07:30,953 --> 02:07:34,833
...maybe we can all look forward
to a time when none of us...

1301
02:07:35,166 --> 02:07:38,366
...will have to discharge
another firearm ever again.

1302
02:07:39,837 --> 02:07:44,357
Now enjoy yourselves.
Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.

1303
02:07:47,428 --> 02:07:51,548
Does this mean we can finally use
the lake house on weekends?

1304
02:07:54,477 --> 02:07:55,677
Hello.

1305
02:07:55,895 --> 02:07:58,295
Yes. Right away.

1306
02:07:58,690 --> 02:08:01,690
- Excuse me, so sorry.
- Excuse me.

1307
02:08:02,027 --> 02:08:03,347
- Sir?
- Yes.

1308
02:08:03,570 --> 02:08:07,130
Sir, you have an emergency call
on your private line.

1309
02:08:08,367 --> 02:08:10,007
Yes, this is Burgess.

1310
02:08:10,243 --> 02:08:14,643
Hello, Lamar. I just wanted
to congratulate you. You did it.

1311
02:08:14,999 --> 02:08:17,399
You created a world without murder.

1312
02:08:17,668 --> 02:08:20,708
Everyone wants your name on a hat.
Can you sign these?

1313
02:08:21,005 --> 02:08:23,365
All you had to do was kill someone
to do it.

1314
02:08:28,221 --> 02:08:29,221
A-room. Jad.

1315
02:08:30,265 --> 02:08:33,465
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

1316
02:08:33,810 --> 02:08:38,210
- What are you talking about?
- Agatha 's mother, Anne Lively.

1317
02:08:38,565 --> 02:08:42,725
Just a junkie who had a kid once
and had to give her up, but surprise!

1318
02:08:43,070 --> 02:08:45,910
She cleaned herself up,
and she wanted her daughter back.

1319
02:08:46,198 --> 02:08:48,078
She wanted Agatha.

1320
02:08:50,661 --> 02:08:54,901
Jad, you getting this? It's from the
female only. No time or incident data.

1321
02:08:55,249 --> 02:08:57,609
It isn't the future.
It already happened.

1322
02:08:57,878 --> 02:09:01,478
And the problem was, without Agatha,
there was no Precrime.

1323
02:09:01,798 --> 02:09:06,398
She's the strongest of the three.
Without Agatha, you had nothing.

1324
02:09:06,761 --> 02:09:11,961
You wouldn't be where you are now,
standing there, signing autographs.

1325
02:09:20,025 --> 02:09:23,305
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing with that?

1326
02:09:23,612 --> 02:09:27,052
- What you up to, big man?
- Think before you send that.

1327
02:09:27,366 --> 02:09:28,366
Slow down.

1328
02:09:49,014 --> 02:09:53,534
Now you had to get rid of Anne Lively,
which presented a problem:

1329
02:09:53,894 --> 02:09:57,414
How can you kill her
without the Pre-Cogs seeing it?

1330
02:09:57,731 --> 02:10:01,811
Simple. Use a system
you control against her.

1331
02:10:02,195 --> 02:10:07,195
You hired someone to kill her, knowing
the Pre-Cogs would see that murder.

1332
02:10:07,575 --> 02:10:10,975
You lured Anne Lively
out to the lake...

1333
02:10:11,287 --> 02:10:15,127
...with the promise of reuniting her
with her daughter.

1334
02:10:59,797 --> 02:11:01,717
Where's my daughter?

1335
02:11:09,056 --> 02:11:10,216
Where?

1336
02:11:12,309 --> 02:11:13,549
Run!

1337
02:11:17,022 --> 02:11:18,102
Run!

1338
02:11:29,786 --> 02:11:32,986
When you were all alone,
you killed her yourself...

1339
02:11:33,289 --> 02:11:37,089
...in the same way the Pre-Cogs
predicted your John Doe would kill her.

1340
02:11:37,419 --> 02:11:40,219
You made the real murder
look like an echo...

1341
02:11:40,505 --> 02:11:45,065
...knowing the tech would do what
he was trained to do: Disregard it.

1342
02:11:51,016 --> 02:11:55,296
Anne Lively became
just another missing person.

1343
02:11:56,106 --> 02:11:59,146
So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?

1344
02:12:00,026 --> 02:12:01,866
What are you gonna do?

1345
02:12:13,081 --> 02:12:14,361
We got a Red Ball!

1346
02:12:20,590 --> 02:12:23,390
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1347
02:12:23,676 --> 02:12:26,436
Think about the lives
that little girl has saved.

1348
02:12:26,721 --> 02:12:31,121
Think of all the lives she will save.
She could have saved Sean.

1349
02:12:31,475 --> 02:12:33,955
Don't you ever say his name!

1350
02:12:36,273 --> 02:12:39,313
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1351
02:12:39,609 --> 02:12:42,489
You used the memory of my dead son
to set me up.

1352
02:12:42,779 --> 02:12:45,659
You knew that would
drive me to murder.

1353
02:12:45,949 --> 02:12:49,229
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?
- What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

1354
02:12:49,536 --> 02:12:51,456
- How are you gonna...?
- Shut me up?

1355
02:12:51,705 --> 02:12:53,945
Forgive me, John.

1356
02:13:02,383 --> 02:13:04,103
Forgive me, John.

1357
02:13:15,772 --> 02:13:17,052
Lamar.

1358
02:13:17,524 --> 02:13:18,884
It's over.

1359
02:13:19,609 --> 02:13:24,689
The question you have to ask is,
what are you gonna do now?

1360
02:13:38,087 --> 02:13:41,007
No doubt the Pre-Cogs have
already seen this.

1361
02:13:41,299 --> 02:13:42,899
No doubt.

1362
02:13:43,968 --> 02:13:46,208
You see the dilemma, don't you?

1363
02:13:46,971 --> 02:13:51,211
If you don't kill me, Pre-Cogs were
wrong and Precrime is over.

1364
02:13:52,435 --> 02:13:55,835
If you do kill me, you go away...

1365
02:13:56,482 --> 02:14:00,762
...but it proves the system works.
Pre-Cogs were right.

1366
02:14:07,034 --> 02:14:10,274
So, what are you gonna do now?

1367
02:14:11,706 --> 02:14:13,626
What's it worth?

1368
02:14:14,501 --> 02:14:16,741
Just one more murder.

1369
02:14:19,672 --> 02:14:24,592
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but
people will still believe in Precrime.

1370
02:14:24,969 --> 02:14:28,849
All you have to do is kill me,
like they said you would.

1371
02:14:32,352 --> 02:14:33,872
Except...

1372
02:14:34,813 --> 02:14:37,173
...you know your own future...

1373
02:14:37,483 --> 02:14:40,963
...which means you can change it
if you want to.

1374
02:14:42,154 --> 02:14:45,074
You still have a choice, Lamar.

1375
02:14:45,658 --> 02:14:47,458
Like I did.

1376
02:14:52,206 --> 02:14:54,846
Yes, I have a choice...

1377
02:14:56,252 --> 02:14:58,172
...and I made it.

1378
02:14:59,172 --> 02:15:01,092
Forgive me, John.

1379
02:15:02,759 --> 02:15:04,479
Forgive me.

1380
02:15:09,808 --> 02:15:11,448
Forgive me, my boy.

1381
02:15:30,162 --> 02:15:31,682
Lamar!

1382
02:15:42,926 --> 02:15:47,566
In 2054, the six-year Precrime
experiment was abandoned.

1383
02:15:55,189 --> 02:15:58,549
All prisoners were unconditionally
pardoned and released...

1384
02:15:58,860 --> 02:16:02,980
...although police departments
kept watch on many of them for years.

1385
02:16:50,914 --> 02:16:53,194
Agatha and the twins...

1386
02:16:53,458 --> 02:16:56,698
...were transferred
to an undisclosed location...

1387
02:16:57,670 --> 02:17:01,110
...a place where they could
find relief from their gifts...

1388
02:17:01,550 --> 02:17:05,390
...a place where they could
live out their lives in peace.
