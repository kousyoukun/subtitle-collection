33
00:04:47,478 --> 00:04:49,678
-我以前见过他 -确定？
Seen him before.  How can you tell?

34
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:52,779
没眼镜你不是像瞎子？ 你的眼镜呢？
You're blind without your glasses. Where are your glasses?

35
00:04:53,067 --> 00:04:55,787

37
00:05:11,837 --> 00:05:16,077

I was thinking maybe I'd play hooky, stay home today.

47

-“贡献一己心力的时候到了” -你觉得怎么样？
"We've come to dedicate a portion..."  What do you think?

48
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:23,491
-你不是要开会吗？ -改时间
What about your meeting?  I'll reschedule.

49
00:06:23,787 --> 00:06:26,187
我太卖力工作了

50
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:30,331
-“这么做…”，好啊 -我们一起吃午饭

我没时间应付联邦菜鸟
I don't need some twink from the fed poking around.

61
00:07:05,831 --> 00:07:07,311

69
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:29,694
马克斯家上周搬家，下落不明
They moved two weeks ago. Nobody knows where. Still searching for family.

70
00:07:30,023 --> 00:07:31,663
剩余时间：12分钟
Time horizon, 12 minutes.

00:07:31,984 --> 00:07:33,984
他在鸡蛋里挑骨头 想办法找出凶案地点的线索
He's scrubbing the image, looking for...

72
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,433

And that this nation, under God, shall not perish from the earth.

75
00:07:48,084 --> 00:07:50,604
受害者在这，凶手在这里
Victims are pronounced here, killers here.

76
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:55,159
除了姓名与日期 只有他们制作的影像
Beyond that, all we have to run on are the images that they produce.

The PreCogs can see a murder four days out. Why the late call?

81
00:08:16,988 --> 00:08:21,268
红球-冲动型犯罪 不是预谋，所以比较晚知道
A Red Ball. Crimes of passion have no premeditation, so they show up late.

82
00:08:21,619 --> 00:08:25,979
突发事件占大多数 预谋犯罪已经很少见

他在这男人左边
In this one, he's on the left side of the man.

88

It's gotta be Barnaby Woods. Evanna, flight time?

95
00:09:25,144 --> 00:09:27,624
起飞后三分钟可以了
The way I drive? Three minutes after wheels up.

96
00:09:41,202 --> 00:09:42,602
-可以了 -可以了
Clear.  Clear.

97
00:10:02,724 --> 00:10:05,444
剩余时间：6分钟
Time horizon, six minutes.

98
00:10:41,599 --> 00:10:43,599
上床去吧
Let's go to bed.

99
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:45,856
在这里就好啦

00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,430
-床比较软 -我的身体很软
But the bed is soft.  I'm soft.

101
00:11:36,573 --> 00:11:37,933
糟了！
Shit.

102
00:11:39,617 --> 00:11:40,977
哪一家？
Which one is it?

103
00:11:47,667 --> 00:11:50,307
-我不喜欢这张床！ -来嘛
Not the bed.  Come on.

104
00:11:50,587 --> 00:11:52,787
我不喜欢在床上玩！
I don't want to be on the bed.

105
00:11:56,301 --> 00:12:00,381
-一分钟，快追上未来了 -闭嘴，艾文纳，杰德？
We're catching up to the future.  Shut up, Evanna. Jad?

106
00:12:01,057 --> 00:12:03,217
-杰德？ -请讲

109
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,350

Front door...

110
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,439
跟你说我不喜欢在床上玩
I didn't wanna be on the bed.

00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:33,239
-开着，前门是开着的 -30秒
Negative. The front door is open.  Time horizon, 30 seconds.

112
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,330
我忘了眼镜
I forgot my glasses.

113
00:12:43,602 --> 00:12:44,682
霍华！
Howard.

114
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,693
不戴眼镜我简直跟瞎子一样
You know how blind I am without them.

115
00:13:00,244 --> 00:13:02,004
霍华，不要哭
Howard, don't cry.

I didn't do anything. Sarah?  Give the man his hat.

123

不要给我戴那头铐！莎拉！
Oh, God. Don't put that halo on me. Sarah!

124
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:56,197
-手放在头上 -救救我！我什么都没打算做！
Put your hand on your head.  Help me! I wasn't gonna do anything!

噢，霍华，不！

129

I thought they stopped the murder.

132
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:29,376
这是“回音”，或称“前视印象”
That's just an echo. PreCog deja vu, if you will.

133
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,873
预视者会不断看见发生的凶案
The really bad ones the PreCogs see over and over again.

134
00:14:33,174 --> 00:14:35,334
华利，把剩下的洗掉
Wally, erase the incoming.

135
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:53,117
想象一个没有凶案的世界
Imagine a world without murder.

136
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:56,115
-我失去最好的朋友 -我失去姑姑
I lost my best friend.  I lost my aunt.

137
00:14:56,407 --> 00:14:58,407
-我失去我父亲 -我太太惨遭杀害
I lost my dad.  I lost my wife.

138
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:03,183
六年前，美国凶案发生率 达到历史最高峰
Just six years ago, the homicide rate had reached epidemic proportions.

139
00:15:03,706 --> 00:15:06,546
似乎只有奇迹才能终止这现象
It seemed that only a miracle could stop the bloodshed.

140
00:15:06,876 --> 00:15:10,916
奇迹诞生了，而且有三个 犯罪预视先知
But instead of one miracle, we were given three: The PreCognitives.

141
00:15:11,297 --> 00:15:13,977
犯罪预防条例实施一个月后
Within just one month under the Precrime program...

142
00:15:14,301 --> 00:15:17,741
哥伦比亚区的凶案下降90%
...the murder rate in the District of Columbia was reduced 90%% .

143
00:15:18,097 --> 00:15:20,137
-他们在等我 -他将会强暴我
They were waiting for me.  He was gonna rape me.

144
00:15:20,432 --> 00:15:22,192
-我会被刺死 -这里
I was going to be stabbed.  Right here.

145
00:15:22,434 --> 00:15:26,794
一年之内，犯罪预防中心 阻止了首府所有凶案
Within a year, Precrime effectively stopped murder in our nation 's capital.

146
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,270
实验计划进行六年来
In the six years of our experiment...

147
00:15:29,502 --> 00:15:30,400
犯罪防治局局长

148
00:15:30,735 --> 00:15:32,975
一桩命案都未曾发生
...there hasn't been a single murder.

149
00:15:33,237 --> 00:15:35,357
现在犯罪防治局将正式成立
And now Precrime can work for you.

150
00:15:35,698 --> 00:15:38,458
我们希望能够确定国人
We want to make certain that every American...

151
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:41,745
能信赖此系统的精确性
...can bank on the infallibility of the system.

152
00:15:42,205 --> 00:15:47,365
在带来安全的同时 还能确保国人的自由
And to ensure that what keeps us safe will also keep us free.

153
00:15:48,921 --> 00:15:50,881
-犯罪防治局-有效 -功效卓著
Precrime. It works.  It works.

154
00:15:51,172 --> 00:15:52,492
-功效卓著 -功效卓著
It works.  It works.

155
00:15:52,716 --> 00:15:54,316
-功效卓著 -功效卓著
It works.  It works.

156
00:15:54,968 --> 00:15:57,248
犯罪防治局-有效！
Precrime. It works.

157
00:15:57,596 --> 00:16:02,356
4月22日星期二，请投票赞成 国家犯罪防治局的成立
On Tuesday, April 22, vote "yes" on the National Precrime Initiative.

158
00:16:05,646 --> 00:16:08,846
怎么回事？睡不着？
What's the matter? Can't sleep?

159
00:16:14,197 --> 00:16:16,997
-我需要来点“冰品” -内行人
Just need a little clarity.  True that.

160
00:16:17,658 --> 00:16:22,258
传统冰品还是改良的新配方？
You want the customary clarity or the new and improved kind of clarity?

161
00:16:22,998 --> 00:16:24,278
新玩意儿
Give me the new stuff.

162
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:29,956
改良新配方，全新“冰品” 冰得你心旷神怡
New and improved clarity. Clarity, clarity. Yes, indeed.

163
00:16:30,714 --> 00:16:32,034
快点，快点
Come on. Come on.

164
00:16:32,299 --> 00:16:35,539
才四瓶，其中有的还没效
Don't bust my balls. You've only given me four, and some of these are duds.

165
00:16:36,136 --> 00:16:37,616
祝你好梦，队长
Sweet dreams, chief.

166
00:16:40,682 --> 00:16:43,082
别担心，我守口如瓶
Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me.

167
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:45,672
身边有个大人物也不错
I could use a little juice on my side.

168
00:16:45,939 --> 00:16:48,139
你知道些什么？
What do you think you know?

169
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:51,039
我爸以前常说
It's like my daddy used to say:

170
00:16:51,819 --> 00:16:54,739
“在瞎子的世界里
"In the land of the blind...

171
00:16:55,949 --> 00:17:00,149
独眼龙足以当国王”
...the oneeyed man is king. "

172
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,795
我回来了
I'm home.

173
00:17:31,402 --> 00:17:32,402
顶灯
Overhead.

174
00:18:29,213 --> 00:18:30,213
电视墙
Wall screen.

175
00:18:36,971 --> 00:18:39,211
-西恩！ -嗨，爸爸
Sean.  Hi, Daddy.

176
00:18:39,849 --> 00:18:42,049
能不能教我跑快一点？
Can you teach me how to run faster?

177
00:18:42,310 --> 00:18:47,150
班上同学跑得都比我快
Because all the kids in my class run faster than me.

178
00:18:47,774 --> 00:18:48,854
这很好
That's good.

179
00:18:49,109 --> 00:18:51,269
膝盖抬高一点
Keep your knees up.

180
00:18:52,112 --> 00:18:55,032
像那样，高，再高
Like that. Like that. High. High. Like that.

181
00:18:55,699 --> 00:18:58,859
-看到没，你是天生飞毛腿 -我一定要常练习跑步！
See, you're a natural runner.  Gotta keep running.

182
00:18:59,202 --> 00:19:01,962
不断的跑吧
Yeah. Gotta keep running.

183
00:19:02,832 --> 00:19:04,352
你要不断的跑
Gotta keep running.

184
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:09,536
-将来会跟你跑的一样快吗？ -有一天你会比我快
Will I be as fast as you someday?  Oh, I think you'll beat me someday.

185
00:19:10,089 --> 00:19:13,489
-将来会比谁都快 -我想你将来会比谁都快
You're gonna beat everybody.  I think you'll beat everyone someday.

186
00:19:13,802 --> 00:19:16,962
-我要走了，拜拜 -等等
I gotta go. Bye.  No, no, no. Wait, wait.

187
00:19:17,263 --> 00:19:19,943
-给我亲一个 -不能亲嘴唇
You gotta give me a kiss.  Not on the lips.

188
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:23,722
那是妈妈的专利
Only Mommy kisses me on the lips.

189
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,460
好吧，好吧
Yeah, all right. All right.

190
00:19:26,106 --> 00:19:27,426
我爱你
I love you.

191
00:19:28,025 --> 00:19:31,265
-我爱你，西恩 -我爱你，爸爸
I love you, Sean.  I love you, Daddy.

192
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:34,811
档案结束

193
00:20:06,523 --> 00:20:08,723
它让我想起罗赛里多海滩
Reminds me of Rosarito Beach.

194
00:20:10,486 --> 00:20:11,726
记得吗？
Remember?

195
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,140
我们只有20元
We had 20 dollars and...

196
00:20:15,825 --> 00:20:19,985
睡在车里等待日出 继续度假
Waiting in that van so the sun would shine on our vacation.

197
00:20:22,498 --> 00:20:26,418
约翰！约翰！ 不要拍
John. John. John, put the camera down.

198
00:20:26,753 --> 00:20:31,713
我准备要睡觉了 你在干嘛？拿走啦
Look, I'm all ready for bed. What is this? No. Put it away.

199
00:20:32,092 --> 00:20:34,452
收起来
It's time to put the camera to sleep...

200
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,920
该照顾的是你老婆
...and time to come and take care of your wife.

201
00:20:40,517 --> 00:20:45,917
不要拍啦，陪我看雨？
Why don 't you put the camera down and come and watch the rain with me?

202
00:20:46,648 --> 00:20:50,248
不要？我会让你永生难忘喔
No? I promise I'll make it a memorable moment.

203
00:20:54,448 --> 00:20:57,808
摄影机放下，不然今晚别碰我
Put the camera down or you're not getting anything tonight.

204
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:03,935
档案结束

205
00:21:39,538 --> 00:21:42,818
司法部要把这系统拿走
A gentleman at Justice wants to take this away from us.

206
00:21:43,124 --> 00:21:45,804
一星期后，民众将投票决定
In a week, people will vote on whether or not...

207
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:49,286
我们这儿执行的是高尚的工作
...what we've been doing has been a nobleminded enterprise...

208
00:21:49,589 --> 00:21:52,829
一个改变打击犯罪方式的机会
...or a chance to change the way this country fights crime.

209
00:21:53,218 --> 00:21:54,458
约翰
John...

210
00:21:55,096 --> 00:21:59,296
注意这个丹尼威妥 司法部来的
...watch this Danny Witwer, the observer from Justice.

211
00:21:59,642 --> 00:22:02,442
-我昨天见过他 -带他参观
I met him yesterday.  Let him look around.

212
00:22:02,728 --> 00:22:04,928
回答他的问题 但，多留意点
Answer his questions, but watch him.

213
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,909
有问题的话，我们得先知道
If there's any problem, make sure we know about it.

214
00:22:08,818 --> 00:22:12,378
被害人和凶手姓名刻在木球上
When the PreCogs declare a killer, their name is embedded in the wood.

215
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:17,177
因为每个球形状和纹理都不同 所以不可能被伪造
Since the shape and grain of each piece is unique, they're impossible to forge.

216
00:22:17,535 --> 00:22:21,135
据我所知 犯罪预防理论在法理上有瑕疵
You understand the legalistic drawback to Precrime methodology.

217
00:22:21,456 --> 00:22:24,096
-又来了 -我也不赞成人权协会的看法
Here we go again.  I'm not with the ACLU on this...

218
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:26,936
但还没犯法我们就先行逮捕
...but we arrest individuals who've broken no law.

219
00:22:27,212 --> 00:22:29,772
-他们一定会犯罪 -预测完全依照物理法则
They will.  The commission is metaphysics.

220
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:32,688
先知预见未来，未曾有错
The PreCogs see the future, and they're never wrong.

221
00:22:32,968 --> 00:22:34,688
阻止了，未来就不会发生
But it's not the future if you stop it.

222
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:38,249
-这岂不自相矛盾？ -没错
Isn't that a fundamental paradox?  Yes.

223
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:42,357
你说的就是必然性 这现象随处可见
You're talking about predetermination, which happens all the time.

224
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,840
-你为什么要抓住它？ -它快掉下去了
Why'd you catch that?  It was gonna fall.

225
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,309
你确定？
You're certain?

226
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,889
但它还没掉下去 就被你抓住了
But it didn't fall. You caught it.

227
00:22:53,574 --> 00:22:56,774
虽被你阻止了，但一定会发生
Preventing it doesn't change the fact that it was going to happen.

228
00:22:57,077 --> 00:22:59,397
曾经发生误判吗？
You ever get any false positives?

229
00:22:59,663 --> 00:23:04,503
有人想杀妻，但没动手 先知分辨得出来吗？
Someone intends to kill, but doesn't. How do the PreCogs tell the difference?

230
00:23:04,876 --> 00:23:08,596
先知看不见你的意图 只看见你即将做的事
They don't see what you intend to do, only what you will do.

231
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,763
为什么看不到强暴案 袭击或是自杀事件？
Why can't they see rapes, assaults, suicides?

232
00:23:12,051 --> 00:23:14,011
谋杀的本质
Because of the nature of murder.

233
00:23:14,261 --> 00:23:17,501
“伤害人类连系最盛者”
Nothing's more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that binds us...

234
00:23:17,807 --> 00:23:21,687
-“莫过彼此间相互谋害” -不会是惠特曼的诗句吧
...than the untimely murder of a human.  That wasn't Walt Whitman.

235
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:26,580
是艾莉丝海曼 预视系统与接口的设计者
Iris Hineman. She developed PreCogs, designed the system and the interface.

236
00:23:26,941 --> 00:23:29,741
提到接口，可以打个招呼吗？
Speaking of interfacing, I'd love to say hello.

237
00:23:30,028 --> 00:23:33,308
-跟海曼？ -跟他们
To Hineman?  To them.

238
00:23:34,074 --> 00:23:38,394
-警察禁止进入圣殿 -你没进去过？
Cops aren't allowed inside the temple.  You've never been inside?

239
00:23:38,745 --> 00:23:42,025
保持隔离，以免被控干预办案
We keep strict separation so that no one can be accused of tampering.

240
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:46,413
-那我就是第一个进去的人 -你没听清楚吗？
I'll be the first one to go in then?  Maybe you didn't hear me.

241
00:23:46,796 --> 00:23:50,476
-如果是权限问题 -不
If it's a question of authority...  There is no question.

242
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,559
你根本毫无权限
You don't have any.

243
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:56,010
我的搜索令上写的可不一样
I have a warrant in my pocket that says different.

244
00:24:07,692 --> 00:24:10,612
-给我看 -没问题
Show it to me.  Sure.

245
00:24:15,909 --> 00:24:18,629
针对犯罪预防中心的调查一事
This investigation of Precrime and its personnel is conducted...

246
00:24:18,912 --> 00:24:23,352
直接受首席检察官的管辖和许可
...under the direct supervision and permission from the attorney general.

247
00:24:23,917 --> 00:24:25,917
我在此是他的代表
I'm here as his representative...

248
00:24:26,170 --> 00:24:30,090
也就是说 我现在是你的顶头上司
...which means you're now operating under my supervision.

249
00:24:34,637 --> 00:24:37,837
看起来你不了解状况
Seems you've been left out of the loop.

250
00:24:47,526 --> 00:24:50,486
准备好了，走吧
All right, we're ready. Let's go.

251
00:24:56,535 --> 00:25:00,455
-站住 -不得进入
Hold it right there. Hold on.  Not cleared for access.

252
00:25:02,041 --> 00:25:04,401
眼珠辨识 约翰安德顿，允许进入
Eyedent: John Anderton. Approved.

253
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,683
-华利 -不可以
Wally.  No, no, no, no.

254
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:17,128
这位是司法部来的丹尼威妥 他有权彻底视察
Danny Witwer from Justice. We're to give him the run of the farm.

255
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,952
-我不能碰到你！ -别碰他或任何东西
I can't touch you.  Don't touch anything.

256
00:25:20,226 --> 00:25:23,386
-你不能进来 -回答他的问题，我们马上走
You can't be in here.  Just answer his questions.

257
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:26,169
-告诉我… -他们在睡觉
Tell me how...  They're sleeping.

258
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:29,282
对不起，介绍一下这里的作业
Sorry. Tell me how all this works.

259
00:25:30,571 --> 00:25:33,331
光子乳液的功能是养分与导体
The photon milk acts as both a nutrient supply and conductor.

260
00:25:33,616 --> 00:25:37,736
它会强化他们收到的影像 那位女性叫亚嘉莎
It enhances the images they receive. We call the female Agatha.

261
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:42,878
双胞胎是阿瑟和戴希尔 以光学断层摄影术作扫瞄
The twins are Arthur and Dashiell. We scan by way of optical tomography.

262
00:25:43,251 --> 00:25:46,011
白色光点指示头盔内的脉动
Whitelight pinpoints pulse along the length of the headgear...

263
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,295
吸收脑波后再重新解读
...and are reread after absorption through their brain tissue.

264
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,977
换句话说，我们见其所见
In other words, we see what they see.

265
00:25:54,512 --> 00:25:57,912
他们不会感到痛苦 我们持续供给多巴胺和恩多啡
They don't feel pain. We keep their heads stocked with dopamine.

266
00:25:58,225 --> 00:26:01,585
此外，撒托宁也在控制中
Plus, we maintain careful control over their serotonin levels.

267
00:26:02,103 --> 00:26:04,783
不能沉睡
Don't want them to drift off into too deep a sleep.

268
00:26:05,065 --> 00:26:09,545
-也不能太清醒 -最好不要把他们当人类
They can't be kept too awake either.  Don't think of them as human.

269
00:26:10,529 --> 00:26:13,449
不，他们伟大多了
No. They're much more than that.

270
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:18,830
奇迹大多被科学粉碎了
Science has stolen most of our miracles.

271
00:26:20,707 --> 00:26:24,627
某方面说，他们给我们希望 对于神性的希望
In a way, they give us hope, hope of the existence of the divine.

272
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:28,642
有人开始将先知当成神
It's interesting that some people have begun to deify the PreCogs.

273
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:31,125
先知只是辨识模式的过滤器
PreCogs are patternrecognition filters. That's all.

274
00:26:31,385 --> 00:26:34,345
-你们称这里为“圣殿” -只是个外号
Yet you call this room the "temple. "  A nickname.

275
00:26:34,638 --> 00:26:36,718
权力不在神谕本身
The oracle isn't where the power is, anyway.

276
00:26:36,974 --> 00:26:41,454
而在祭司，他们甚至假造神谕
The power is with the priests, even if they had to invent the oracle.

277
00:26:43,147 --> 00:26:46,027
你们点头，好像懂他的意思
You guys are nodding like you know what he's talking about.

278
00:26:46,567 --> 00:26:50,607
队长，我们改变命运的做法
Well, come on, chief. The way we work, changing destiny and all...

279
00:26:50,946 --> 00:26:52,946
根本像神职人员而不是警察
...we're more like clergy than cops.

280
00:26:53,199 --> 00:26:54,759
-杰德 -是的？
Jad.  Yeah?

281
00:26:55,201 --> 00:26:58,441
去工作 全部去
Go to work. All of you.

282
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:08,751
对不起，老习惯
Sorry. Old habit.

283
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:12,527
当警察前，我念过三年神学院
I spent three years at Fuller Seminary before I became a cop.

284
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:15,965
-我父亲感到十分光荣 -他现在怎么想？
My father was proud.  What does he think of your work?

285
00:27:16,265 --> 00:27:20,785
不知道，我15岁时 他在都柏林的教堂被杀
I don't know. He was shot and killed when I was 15 at our church in Dublin.

286
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:23,945
我知道失去亲人的感受
I know what it's like to lose someone close.

287
00:27:24,231 --> 00:27:26,391
但失去儿子最为痛苦
Nothing's like the loss of a child.

288
00:27:26,651 --> 00:27:30,731
我没有孩子，只能靠想象
I don't have any children, so I can only imagine what that was like.

289
00:27:31,072 --> 00:27:34,592
在公共场所失去儿子的感觉
To lose your son in such a public place like that...

290
00:27:34,909 --> 00:27:37,989
至少这种事不会再发生了
Now we can make sure that kind of thing doesn't happen to anyone.

291
00:27:38,288 --> 00:27:41,888
-废话少说，你想找什么？ -瑕疵
Tell me what it is you're looking for.  Flaws.

292
00:27:42,375 --> 00:27:44,975
六年内没有谋杀案，系统十分…
There hasn't been a murder in six years. This system is...

293
00:27:45,254 --> 00:27:49,694
完美，我同意，瑕疵出在人
Perfect. I agree. If there's a flaw, it's human.

294
00:27:50,342 --> 00:27:52,302
不变的真理
It always is.

295
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:55,100
约翰
John.

296
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:38,847
华利
Wally.

297
00:28:44,774 --> 00:28:48,614
你看到了吗？
Can you see?

298
00:29:20,812 --> 00:29:24,292
发生什么事？ 她的肾上腺素破表了
What happened? Her ACTH levels just shot through the roof!

299
00:29:24,607 --> 00:29:26,487
-你对她做了什么？ -她抓住我
What'd you do?  She grabbed me.

300
00:29:26,735 --> 00:29:30,415
不可能，先知只看得见未来 感觉不到我们的存在
Impossible. They're not aware of us. In the milk, all they see is the future.

301
00:29:30,739 --> 00:29:34,619
-她盯着我看 -作恶梦吧？他们会梦见旧凶案
She looked straight at me.  It could have been a nightmare.

302
00:29:34,951 --> 00:29:38,071
-她跟我说话 -跟你说？
She spoke to me.  To you?

303
00:29:38,372 --> 00:29:40,132
她说什么？
What'd she say?

304
00:29:40,373 --> 00:29:42,773
“你看到了吗？”
"Can you see?"

305
00:29:45,924 --> 00:29:48,222
（看守所）

306
00:30:02,689 --> 00:30:04,209
你是所长？
You the sentry?

307
00:30:05,024 --> 00:30:07,664
是的，长官，我叫吉狄恩
Yes, sir, I'm Gideon.

308
00:30:07,944 --> 00:30:09,944
你是安德顿队长
You're Chief Anderton.

309
00:30:10,781 --> 00:30:13,341
音乐能使犯人放松
The music relaxes the prisoners.

310
00:30:13,617 --> 00:30:16,977
防罪中心警察不曾来过 有问题吗？
I don't ever see you Precops down here. Am I in trouble?

311
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:20,373
还不确定，来查一桩凶案
Not yet. I'm interested in a murder.

312
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:24,107
-多得很，哪种手法？ -溺毙
I got plenty of those. Kill type?  Drowning.

313
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:27,220
这种倒不多
That narrows it down. Not too many in here for that.

314
00:30:27,507 --> 00:30:30,827
-白种女性受害人 -这跟司法部有关吗？
Victim's Caucasian, female.  This about the Justice Department?

315
00:30:31,135 --> 00:30:35,415
我明天出差，这领带怎么样？
I'm supposed to spruce up for a tour they got tomorrow. You like this tie?

316
00:30:35,766 --> 00:30:36,766
停
Stop.

317
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:41,840
倒回去
Roll back.

318
00:30:43,399 --> 00:30:44,639
这里！
There.

319
00:30:44,859 --> 00:30:50,459
早期著名的案子 也许在你到任以前
She's a golden oldie. One of our first. Probably before your time.

320
00:30:51,073 --> 00:30:54,993
-这是三位先知的共同档案？ -对
This is the composite of the three?  That's right.

321
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:58,247
三份影像综合起来播放
Combined data stream based on all three previsions.

322
00:30:58,539 --> 00:31:01,779
-给我看亚嘉莎的 -这个嘛
Just show me Agatha's data stream.  For that...

323
00:31:03,961 --> 00:31:05,681
我们得去找一找
...we go for a ride.

324
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:29,286
我的天
My God.

325
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:31,735
我忘了关了这么多人
I'd forgotten there were so many.

326
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:36,711
要不是你，他们还四处杀人
And to think they'd all be out there killing people if it wasn't for you.

327
00:31:37,371 --> 00:31:40,171
你看看，看起来多祥和
Look at them. Look at how peaceful they seem.

328
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:44,218
但心里头可忙得很
But on the inside: Busy, busy, busy.

329
00:31:44,545 --> 00:31:48,905
对了，这里有个大坏蛋
Okeypokey. Now that is one bad man.

330
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:52,661
他在罗兰湖杀了安莉芙丽
He drowned a woman named Anne Lively out at Roland Lake.

331
00:31:52,971 --> 00:31:56,651
凶手身份一直是个谜
The killer's a John Doe, never identified.

332
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,240
为什么还查不出来？ 眼珠扫瞄也无法辨认？
Why is he still a John Doe? Why wasn't he ID'd from the eye scan?

333
00:32:16,579 --> 00:32:21,139
他跟别人换眼珠，欺骗扫瞄器
Those are not his eyes. He had them swapped out to fool the scanners.

334
00:32:21,501 --> 00:32:25,341
花几千块，到处可以做
You can get it done on the street for a few thousand bucks these days.

335
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:29,352
你只要女先知的影像
Okay, so you want just the female prevision.

336
00:32:29,677 --> 00:32:31,237
对
That's right.

337
00:32:37,393 --> 00:32:40,553
好像没有她的资料
We don't seem to have her data.

338
00:32:41,438 --> 00:32:43,078
再找一次
Try again.

339
00:32:44,567 --> 00:32:48,047
奇怪，看
This is odd. See?

340
00:32:48,362 --> 00:32:53,042
其它两份都在 阿瑟和戴希的影像都在
We have the two previsions. We got what Art saw. We got what Dash saw.

341
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,330
但亚嘉莎的却不见了
But Agatha's isn't here.

342
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:00,270
可能系统出了小问题
Probably just a glitch.

343
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:04,660
跟我谈谈安莉芙丽
Tell me about the intended victim, this Anne Lively.

344
00:33:05,213 --> 00:33:09,053
她跟这位无名氏一样 有“纽洛因”毒瘾
Looks like she's a neuroin addict, like our John Doe here.

345
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:12,225
但她住过毕顿勒戒所
Address history includes the Beaton Clinic.

346
00:33:12,512 --> 00:33:15,592
所以她戒了，她现在住哪？
So she cleaned up. Where is she now?

347
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:16,965
失踪

348
00:33:17,393 --> 00:33:20,113
又出问题，有一就有二
I guess glitches come in twos.

349
00:33:21,605 --> 00:33:26,445
正所谓厄运接踵而至
You finally crawl your way out of one hole just to fall into another.

350
00:33:31,825 --> 00:33:32,825
不行
No.

351
00:33:34,244 --> 00:33:37,164
我不能让你带走，队长
Can't let you take that out of here, chief.

352
00:33:38,081 --> 00:33:41,721
-违反规定 -我看这里违反规定的事不少
It's against the rules.  Anything else against the rules?

353
00:33:47,341 --> 00:33:53,341
小心，挖出陈年往事 只会越弄越脏
Careful, chief. You dig up the past, all you get is dirty.

354
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:01,709
第三份影像呢？模糊不清？
The third prevision was what, kind of fuzzy or something?

355
00:34:02,064 --> 00:34:06,104
第三份，亚嘉莎的不在里面
No, the third prevision, Agatha's prevision, wasn't there.

356
00:34:06,486 --> 00:34:11,406
还不只如此 我发现许多案子都有影像失踪
That's not all. There are a dozen more cases with missing previsions.

357
00:34:11,783 --> 00:34:14,903
怎么到现在还没有感冒特效药
You'd think we'd have found the cure for the common cold.

358
00:34:15,245 --> 00:34:17,445
-你压力太大 -这是什么东西？
It's stress.  What's this?

359
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:19,627
加蜂蜜的青草茶
Herbal tea with honey.

360
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:23,277
青草茶和蜂蜜我都讨厌
I hate herbal tea. Almost as much as I hate honey.

361
00:34:23,629 --> 00:34:26,349
快喝，不然倒在你腿上
Just drink it, before I pour it in your lap.

362
00:34:26,632 --> 00:34:29,392
-喝点什么吗，约翰？ -不用，谢谢
Can I get you anything, John?  No, thank you.

363
00:34:29,886 --> 00:34:33,326
威妥明天也计划参观看守所
Witwer's scheduled for a tour of Containment tomorrow.

364
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:35,561
对，带他去
Yeah, give him a tour.

365
00:34:37,018 --> 00:34:39,418
-劳拉打电话给我 -什么？
Lara called me.  What?

366
00:34:40,147 --> 00:34:43,347
她担心你，说实话，我也担心
She's worried about you. Quite frankly, so am I.

367
00:34:44,234 --> 00:34:45,514
我没问题
I'm fine.

368
00:34:45,777 --> 00:34:49,497
我知道你常到贫民区
I understand you've been spending a lot of time in the Sprawl.

369
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:53,871
-跑步经过罢了 -三更半夜？
I go running down there.  In the middle of the night.

370
00:34:54,661 --> 00:34:57,621
万一威妥要验你的尿怎么办？
What if Danny Witwer insisted on a full chem run?

371
00:34:57,956 --> 00:34:59,556
没问题
I'm fine.

372
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:05,406
约翰，防罪中心变国家机构后 他们会把它抢走
The minute Precrime goes national, they are going to take it away.

373
00:35:05,798 --> 00:35:08,038
-我们不会坐视它发生 -不会？
We won't let them.  No?

374
00:35:08,342 --> 00:35:12,462
一个老头 和一个嗑药条子怎么阻止他们？
How is an old man and a cop on the whiff ever going to stop them?

375
00:35:13,348 --> 00:35:15,548
我老头说过
My father once said to me...

376
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:19,850
“不是你选择爱做的事 是事情选择你”
..."You don't choose the things you believe in. They choose you. "

377
00:35:20,188 --> 00:35:22,028
你在此有其原因
There's a reason you are here.

378
00:35:22,315 --> 00:35:27,860
假如预知犯罪早半年成立
你和劳拉便不用承担如此悲痛
Had Precrime been in place earlier, your loss would have been prevented.

379
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:29,760
记住，全国人的眼睛…
Remember, the eyes...

380
00:35:32,159 --> 00:35:35,439
全国现在都盯着我们看
The eyes of the nation are on us right now.

381
00:35:35,913 --> 00:35:38,993
我是说话没人听的老家伙
I'm not the generation anyone listens to...

382
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:43,333
但民众相信你 如果你说对犯罪预防有信心
...but people trust you when you speak of your belief in Precrime.

383
00:35:44,088 --> 00:35:48,368
他们相信那是肺腑之言 不是政治辞令，我早就知道
They know that it's a belief born of pain, not politics. I understood that.

384
00:35:48,718 --> 00:35:52,158
我也曾促成这件事
I may have even encouraged it to help with the cause.

385
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:57,730
但是，你的伤痛伤害了我们
But now, your pain is hurting both of us.

386
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:04,459
他们抢不走的
They're not going to take it away from us.

387
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:07,169
我不允许
I won't let them.

388
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:39,254
抓到了

00:48:29,014 --> 00:48:30,854
-哦 -不要逃
Yeah.  Don't do it.

522
00:48:31,683 --> 00:48:33,443
嘿，不要逃
Hey, don't do this.

523
00:48:34,269 --> 00:48:35,469
约翰？
John?

524
00:48:35,854 --> 00:48:37,134
不要逃
Don't run.

525
00:48:37,690 --> 00:48:39,650
你没必要追我
You don't have to chase me.

526
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:41,917
你没必要逃
You don't have to run.

527
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,119
每个人都会逃，佛莱契
Everybody runs, Fletch.

528
00:48:44,405 --> 00:48:46,325
我们会逮到你
You know we'll catch you.

529
00:48:47,408 --> 00:48:49,048
每个人都会逃
Everybody runs.

530
00:48:51,079 --> 00:48:55,039
-没必要搞得很难看 -每个人都会逃
It doesn't have to be like this, John.  Everybody runs.

531
00:48:55,374 --> 00:48:57,414
催吐棒准备好
Get your sicksticks ready.

532
00:48:58,878 --> 00:49:00,558
每个人都会逃，佛莱契
Everybody runs, Fletch.

533
00:49:01,173 --> 00:49:03,653
慢慢来，队长，别冲动
Slow down, chief. Just take it easy.

534
00:49:07,763 --> 00:49:09,603
别轻举妄动，队长
No sudden moves, chief.

535
00:49:10,890 --> 00:49:12,810
约翰，没事的
John, it's okay.

536
00:49:13,352 --> 00:49:15,472
-佛莱契… -冷静，别冲动
Fletch...  Easy does it, chief.

537
00:49:44,175 --> 00:49:45,375
抓牢了吗？
Got a grip?

538
00:49:45,594 --> 00:49:47,274
-抓牢了吗？ -抓牢了
Got a grip?  Yeah.

539
00:50:16,125 --> 00:50:17,485
安德顿！
Anderton!

540
00:50:48,701 --> 00:50:51,301
滚出我的厨房！
Go away! Get out of my kitchen!

541
00:50:51,621 --> 00:50:54,541
滚出去！出去！
Get out of my house! Get out of my house! Go!

542
00:50:57,669 --> 00:51:00,069
-出去！ -安德顿，住手！
Get them out of here!  Anderton, stop!

543
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:02,939
拉他下来，佛莱契
Pull him off me, Fletcher. Get him off me.

544
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,840
滚出去！听不懂吗？
Get him out of here! What's the matter with you?!

545
00:51:13,060 --> 00:51:15,180
滚出去！快！
Get out of my house! Go!

546
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:39,955
根据特区犯罪预防中心授权 你被逮捕…
By mandate of the District of Columbia, I'm placing you under arrest for...

547
00:51:40,339 --> 00:51:41,619
睡一觉吧
Go to sleep.

548
00:52:02,570 --> 00:52:04,050
跟我来
You two stay with me!

549
00:55:26,072 --> 00:55:27,903
（非请勿入）

550
00:56:34,981 --> 00:56:36,341
海曼博士？
Dr. Hineman.

551
00:56:37,025 --> 00:56:40,105
你私闯民宅，我不接待访客
You're trespassing. I don't have visitors.

552
00:56:45,534 --> 00:56:48,414
你中了娃娃眼的毒，它的藤蔓
That would be from the doll's eye, the vine...

553
00:56:48,703 --> 00:56:51,903
在你攀墙进来时划破你的皮
...the baneberry that scratched you during your illegal climb over my wall.

554
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:55,887
不是纯娃娃眼 我培育的混种，蛮厉害的
It's not a true doll's eye. It's a little hybrid I designed.

555
00:56:56,253 --> 00:56:59,853
一旦毒液进入血管
Once the poison gets into your bloodstream, you'll start to see...

556
00:57:00,216 --> 00:57:04,216
你会开始看到 蓝色物体的神奇景象
...the most extraordinary display of blue objects.

557
00:57:04,553 --> 00:57:07,913
这星期倒霉透了吧？
This just isn't your week, is it?

558
00:57:09,559 --> 00:57:10,999
安德顿队长
Chief Anderton.

559
00:57:13,479 --> 00:57:14,999
我不是凶手
I'm not a killer.

560
00:57:21,112 --> 00:57:22,512
喝下去
You better drink this.

561
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:26,661
不然你会无法吞咽 然后就完蛋了
Soon you won't be able to swallow, and then you'll be totally buggered.

562
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,278
全部喝掉
All of it.

563
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:33,360
休息一分钟回回神
Okay, now take a minute to right yourself.

564
00:57:34,876 --> 00:57:38,316
你认为我能帮什么忙？
Just what is it you think I can do for you?

565
00:57:40,925 --> 00:57:45,165
告诉我如何 伪造预视影像？
You could tell me how someone can fake a prevision.

566
00:57:45,555 --> 00:57:47,435
我怎么知道？
How would I know that?

567
00:57:47,891 --> 00:57:50,291
因为系统是你发明的
Because you invented Precrime.

568
00:57:52,437 --> 00:57:53,957
有什么好笑的？
What's so funny?

569
00:57:54,522 --> 00:57:59,402
如果基因学上的一个错误 加上科学上的失控
If the consequences of several genetic mistakes and science gone haywire...

570
00:57:59,777 --> 00:58:02,537
叫发明 那么算我发明的
...can be called an invention, then I invented Precrime.

571
00:58:02,864 --> 00:58:04,784
-你不引以为荣？ -不
You don't seem proud.  I'm not.

572
00:58:05,075 --> 00:58:08,115
我想治疗他们，不是加以变造
I was trying to heal them, not turn them into something else.

573
00:58:08,412 --> 00:58:11,092
-治疗谁？ -现在被用来阻止犯罪的人
Heal who?  The innocents we use to stop the guilty.

574
00:58:11,415 --> 00:58:14,495
你是指先知
You're talking about the PreCogs.

575
00:58:14,836 --> 00:58:19,796
你以为他们是试管做出来的？ 他们是侥幸存活者
You think they came from a test tube? They are merely the ones who survived.

576
00:58:20,216 --> 00:58:23,856
我研究吸毒者后代的基因问题
I was doing genetic research, treating children of drug addicts.

577
00:58:24,220 --> 00:58:27,700
十年前，纽洛因刚问世
This was 10 years ago, when neuroin first hit the streets.

578
00:58:28,058 --> 00:58:33,978
成分不纯，粗制滥造的药品 大受知识分子的欢迎
It was impure, not the engineered cocktail popular among the educated.

579
00:58:35,148 --> 00:58:40,668
那些孩子天生脑部受创 大部分12岁以前就死了
All of these kids were born with severe brain damage. Most died before age 12.

580
00:58:41,113 --> 00:58:43,713
少数活下来的有种天赋
Those few who survived, they had a gift.

581
00:58:43,991 --> 00:58:47,191
我称之为天赋，对他们来说 像是上帝开了个大玩笑
I call it a gift. For them, it was more like a cosmic joke.

582
00:58:47,537 --> 00:58:50,177
他们会半夜醒来尖叫
They would wake up in the night, curled in the corner...

583
00:58:50,497 --> 00:58:52,337
乱抓壁纸，因为…
...screaming, clawing at the walls.

584
00:58:52,625 --> 00:58:56,785
他们晚上一闭上眼睛
Because when these children closed their eyes at night...

585
00:58:57,129 --> 00:59:01,409
会梦见凶杀案，一桩接一桩
...they dreamt only of murder over and over, one after the other.

586
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:05,200
我们不久就发现 这些所谓的梦
It didn't take for us long to realize that the real nightmare was...

587
00:59:05,555 --> 00:59:10,315
都成了事实 那些凶杀案实际发生了
...that these dreams were about to come true, these murders were happening.

588
00:59:14,439 --> 00:59:16,759
你说其中一些孩子死了？
You say some of the children died?

589
00:59:17,067 --> 00:59:20,147
很多，尽管我们尽力治疗
So many of them. Despite what we did for them.

590
00:59:20,487 --> 00:59:24,567
或许正因为我们的疗法而死 但，无所谓啦
Or maybe because of what we did to them. But it doesn't matter.

591
00:59:24,950 --> 00:59:27,630
系统很完美，不是吗？
It's a perfect system now, isn't it?

592
00:59:28,871 --> 00:59:30,911
我不可能谋杀别人
I'm not going to commit murder.

593
00:59:31,207 --> 00:59:33,487
我与要杀的人从未谋面
I've never met the man I'm supposed to kill.

594
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:37,873
但一连串的事件发生之后 会导致你去谋杀他
And yet a chain of events has started that will lead you to his murder.

595
00:59:38,256 --> 00:59:40,936
-我会躲着他 -怎么躲？你不认识他
Not if I stay away from him.  Can you avoid a man you've never met?

596
00:59:41,259 --> 00:59:44,099
-你不帮我？ -我没办法，谁都没办法
You won't help?  I can't help you. Nobody can.

597
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,110
先知从未发生错误
The PreCogs are never wrong.

598
00:59:49,601 --> 00:59:51,641
话说回来，偶尔
But occasionally...

599
00:59:52,271 --> 00:59:54,311
他们也会意见相左
...they do disagree.

600
00:59:55,899 --> 00:59:57,019
什么？
What?

601
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:01,879
大多数时候 三个先知看到的都一样
Most of the time, all three PreCogs will see an event in the same way...

602
01:00:02,239 --> 01:00:06,039
偶尔，其中之一会不同
...but once in a while, one of them will see things differently than the others.

603
01:00:06,369 --> 01:00:10,249
天啊，我怎么不知道？
Jesus Christ. Why didn't I know about this?

604
01:00:11,165 --> 01:00:14,245
因为这些关键报告都被毁了
Because these Minority Reports are destroyed the instant they occur.

605
01:00:14,544 --> 01:00:15,664
为什么？
Why?

606
01:00:15,879 --> 01:00:20,639
犯罪预防中心想继续运作 就不能让人觉得不可靠
For Precrime to function, there can't be any suggestion of fallibility.

607
01:00:21,009 --> 01:00:24,009
司法系统容不得丝毫怀疑
Who wants a justice system that instills doubt?

608
01:00:24,305 --> 01:00:27,105
尽管合理，却仍旧是怀疑
It may be reasonable, but it's still doubt.

609
01:00:28,642 --> 01:00:31,362
你是说我冤枉过好人？
Are you saying I've haloed innocent people?

610
01:00:31,645 --> 01:00:35,245
我只是说那些被控谋杀罪名的人
I'm saying that every so often, those accused of a Precrime...

611
01:00:35,566 --> 01:00:38,046
也许会有不一样的未来
...just might have an alternate future.

612
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:42,079
伯吉斯知道关键报告的事吗？
Does Burgess know about this, about this Minority Report?

613
01:00:42,448 --> 01:00:45,848
我跟拉玛开过玩笑 我们是防罪中心的父母
I used to joke with Lamar that we were the parents of Precrime.

614
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:50,880
父母眼中的孩子总是完美的
Parents often see their children as they want them to be and not as they are.

615
01:00:51,249 --> 01:00:56,209
回答我的问题： 拉玛知不知道关键报告？
Answer my question: Does Lamar Burgess know about the Minority Report?

616
01:00:56,588 --> 01:00:58,188
当然知道
Yes, of course, he knew.

617
01:00:58,423 --> 01:01:03,463
但当时我们两人觉得无伤大雅
But at the time, we felt their existence was an insignificant variable.

618
01:01:03,846 --> 01:01:05,726
对你或许无关紧要
Insignificant to you, maybe.

619
01:01:05,972 --> 01:01:09,612
但假如我冤枉过好人呢？
But what about those people that I put away with alternate futures?

620
01:01:09,977 --> 01:01:13,497
-如果国人知道… -那么这套系统就会崩溃
My God, if the country knew...  The system would collapse.

621
01:01:15,691 --> 01:01:18,211
-我对系统有信心 -是吗？
I believe in that system.  Do you really?

622
01:01:18,486 --> 01:01:20,046
你想毁掉它
You wanna bring it down.

623
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:24,040
你会毁掉它 如果你有办法杀死一个人
You will bring it down if you manage to kill your victim.

624
01:01:24,367 --> 01:01:29,247
那等于向大众公然宣示 预知犯罪无效
That'll be the most spectacular public display of how Precrime didn't work.

625
01:01:29,623 --> 01:01:32,463
-我不会杀任何人 -希望你坚持下去
I'm not gonna kill anybody.  Hold that thought.

626
01:01:32,751 --> 01:01:36,071
-我为什么要相信你？ -谁都不能相信
Why should I trust you?  You shouldn't trust anyone.

627
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:39,500
包括检察总长 他想将系统占为己有
Certainly not the attorney general, who wants it all for himself.

628
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:42,440
那位年轻联邦干员想篡你的位
And not the young federal agent, who wants your job.

629
01:01:42,761 --> 01:01:46,801
老头也想保住自己毕生的结晶 谁都不能相信
Not even the old man who just wants to hang on to what he created.

630
01:01:47,140 --> 01:01:50,420
只要找出关键报告
Don't trust anyone. Just find the Minority Report.

631
01:01:52,480 --> 01:01:54,160
你说它们被毁了
You said the Minority Report is destroyed.

632
01:01:54,482 --> 01:01:58,042
纪录被毁，原始报告还在
The record is destroyed. The original report still exists.

633
01:01:58,361 --> 01:02:03,401
根据我的设计，报告产生时 它会储存在一个秘密而安全的地方
I designed it so the report is stored in a safe place, but not declared.

634
01:02:03,783 --> 01:02:05,983
什么安全的地方？
What safe place is that?

635
01:02:06,244 --> 01:02:09,364
有个最安全的地方
The safest place there is.

636
01:02:09,707 --> 01:02:12,547
在哪里？
Where is it?

637
01:02:14,795 --> 01:02:18,635
在先知的体内
Inside the PreCog who predicted it.

638
01:02:23,387 --> 01:02:27,747
你只需要将它下载出来
All you have to do is download it, darling.

639
01:02:29,518 --> 01:02:31,118
这么简单？
That's all, huh?

640
01:02:34,608 --> 01:02:37,328
走进防罪中心办公室
Just walk into Precrime, get into the temple...

641
01:02:37,610 --> 01:02:42,090
走进圣殿，侵入系统 下载关键报告
...somehow tap into these PreCogs and download this Minority Report.

642
01:02:42,449 --> 01:02:44,849
-假如有这报告的话 -然后走出来
If you have one.  And then walk out.

643
01:02:45,118 --> 01:02:49,438
实际上你得用跑的 不过没错，你必须这么作
Actually, you'll have to run out. But yes, that's what you have to do.

644
01:02:50,499 --> 01:02:52,459
你疯了
You're insane.

645
01:02:53,168 --> 01:02:55,208
还是你认为我疯了
Or you think I am.

646
01:02:55,462 --> 01:03:00,462
在靠近犯罪中心前 我的眼珠早被扫瞄十几次！
I'll get eyescanned a dozen times before I get within 10 miles of Precrime.

647
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:05,483
俗语说，不入虎穴焉得虎子
Sometimes in order to see the light, you have to risk the dark.

648
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:09,049
身为警察，抱歉 解职警察
As a policeman... Excuse me, as a former policeman...

649
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,952
我相信你认识一些人
...I'm sure that you know all sorts of people...

650
01:03:12,272 --> 01:03:15,432
可以在这方面上帮助你
...who can help you out in this regard.

651
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:24,618
很有趣，一切生物如此相似
It's funny how all living organisms are alike.

652
01:03:24,909 --> 01:03:28,469
受到威胁时，压力降临时
When the chips are down, when the pressure is on...

653
01:03:28,789 --> 01:03:31,629
每种生物只关心一件事
...every creature on the face of the earth...

654
01:03:31,918 --> 01:03:35,238
只有一件事
...is interested in one thing and one thing only:

655
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:38,500
自己的生存
Its own survival.

656
01:03:40,218 --> 01:03:42,298
去找关键报告
Find the Minority Report.

657
01:03:47,476 --> 01:03:50,116
我怎么知道谁才有关键报告？
How do I even know which one has it?

658
01:03:50,395 --> 01:03:53,595
三人中最有天赋那位
It's always in the more gifted of the three.

659
01:03:55,317 --> 01:03:57,157
到底哪一位？
Which one is that?

660
01:04:00,197 --> 01:04:01,997
女性
The female.

661
01:04:05,160 --> 01:04:08,720
这里，房间里三个男人 被害人在这
We've got three men in a room. The victim is here...

662
01:04:09,039 --> 01:04:13,079
约翰在这，不明男性站在窗外
...John is here, and this unidentified male, at the window.

663
01:04:13,419 --> 01:04:17,099
邻近建筑显示是廉价公寓 但无法辨识地点
The adjacent building suggests public housing, which means...

664
01:04:17,423 --> 01:04:20,143
-有几千栋这种建筑 -到处都是
There's thousands like this one.  They're everywhere.

665
01:04:20,427 --> 01:04:23,227
我们还有22小时
But he doesn't go there to kill Crow for another 22 hours.

666
01:04:23,513 --> 01:04:25,633
你不能坐约翰的椅子
This is Chief Anderton's space.

667
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:27,730
-他走了 -他会回来
He's not here.  He'll be back.

668
01:04:27,976 --> 01:04:31,576
我很怀疑 我猜他躲在贫民窟里
I doubt that. I'm betting he's somewhere in the Sprawl.

669
01:04:31,897 --> 01:04:35,577
躲开电子广告牌扫瞄身份的地方
He's smart enough to go where billboards can't ID him.

670
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:38,181
越少消费者就越少扫瞄器
There's fewer consumers, which means fewer scanners.

671
01:04:38,445 --> 01:04:42,525
-他为什么不远走高飞？ -他自认为无辜
Why won't he just run?  Because he thinks he's innocent.

672
01:04:43,951 --> 01:04:45,711
重点放在贫民窟
We concentrate on the Sprawl.

673
01:04:45,953 --> 01:04:48,873
低空侦搜 搭配二支蜘蛛小组
We do flyovers in ships, with two spyder teams on the ground.

674
01:04:49,165 --> 01:04:53,325
追踪任何有眼睛和心跳的生物
Thermal scan the entire area. Read anything with eyes and a heartbeat.

675
01:05:09,353 --> 01:05:10,593
她在哪里？
Where is she?

676
01:05:29,165 --> 01:05:34,925
毫无预警就开枪，我早知道了
Started blowing buttons for no reason whatsoever, and I knew that.

677
01:05:38,758 --> 01:05:40,758
该死的感冒！
This damn cold.

678
01:05:42,012 --> 01:05:46,092
别担心 即使我塞只死猫在你胸腔里
Don't worry. I could cut open your chest and sew a dead cat in there...

679
01:05:46,433 --> 01:05:50,913
你也不会被感染 这抗生素十分厉害
...you wouldn't get an infection. Not with the antibios I'll shoot into you.

680
01:05:51,271 --> 01:05:52,711
那我就放心了
That's comforting.

681
01:05:52,940 --> 01:05:56,220
你知道 我不能只给你换新的虹膜
You do understand I can't just give you new irises?

682
01:05:56,527 --> 01:05:57,927
请不要碰
Please, don't touch.

683
01:05:58,154 --> 01:06:01,954
伤疤被扫瞄到，警铃就会响
Because the scanners would read the new scar tissue, alarms will go off...

684
01:06:02,283 --> 01:06:04,763
带枪的大个子就会出现
...and large men with guns will appear.

685
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:09,009
那是什么东西？
What was that?

686
01:06:09,248 --> 01:06:10,368
那是什么？
What was that?

687
01:06:10,583 --> 01:06:15,023
-麻醉剂，让你乖乖就范… -你习惯偷袭病患吗？
It's anesthesia. It's all downhill...  You always sneak up on your patients?

688
01:06:15,380 --> 01:06:19,340
钱没赚到，我不会害你
You wouldn't break the hand of a violinist before the concert.

689
01:06:19,676 --> 01:06:21,236
别紧张
Please, relax.

690
01:06:25,849 --> 01:06:30,929
我必须把你的眼睛整个拿出来
All I'm trying to tell you is that I'll have to remove your eyes completely.

691
01:06:31,313 --> 01:06:32,433
我知道
I know.

692
01:06:33,399 --> 01:06:37,439
-然后换一对新的 -旧的我要保存起来
I have to replace them with new ones.  I know. But I wanna keep the old ones.

693
01:06:37,779 --> 01:06:41,299
-为什么？ -身体发肤受之父母
Why?  Because my mother gave them to me.

694
01:06:41,616 --> 01:06:43,896
你留着也没用，又不能卖
What's it to you? You can't resell them.

695
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,960
随便你，出钱的是你
Whatever you say. It's your money.

696
01:06:54,338 --> 01:06:58,818
我美丽的助手凡艾可小姐
Let me introduce my gorgeous assistant, Miss Van Eyck.

697
01:07:19,781 --> 01:07:24,021
-钱并不多 -能动用的只有这些
This is not a lot of money.  It's all that I could safely move.

698
01:07:27,122 --> 01:07:28,682
好吧
Okay.

699
01:07:32,544 --> 01:07:35,784
-你给我打哪种药？ -微笑剂
What did you give me?  Smile medicine.

700
01:07:36,089 --> 01:07:38,489
告诉你也无妨 老朋友了
Tell you what, since we go way back...

701
01:07:38,759 --> 01:07:42,879
我给你打个折扣
...why don't I give you my old pal discount? What do you say?

702
01:07:43,222 --> 01:07:45,382
你不记得我了吧？
You don't remember me, do you?

703
01:07:45,641 --> 01:07:49,001
-我们认识吗？ -认识
We know each other?  Yes, we do.

704
01:07:49,395 --> 01:07:51,275
在哪认识？特区？
From where? D.C.?

705
01:07:51,523 --> 01:07:55,923
-巴尔的摩，城东 -巴尔的摩？认识很久了？
Baltimore. The East Side.  Baltimore? We go way back.

706
01:07:56,277 --> 01:08:00,157
所罗门艾迪医师，整形外科
Solomon P. Eddie, M.D. I was a plastic surgeon.

707
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:05,530
我专治烧伤病患，特别是女性
You remember? Specialized in burn victims, mostly women.

708
01:08:05,913 --> 01:08:09,433
-我逮捕过你 -没错
I put you away.  Yeah, you did.

709
01:08:11,376 --> 01:08:13,536
你还拍摄录像带
You made those tapes.

710
01:08:13,796 --> 01:08:16,276
业余表演艺术
They were performance pieces.

711
01:08:17,674 --> 01:08:21,674
-那些病患是你放的火 -我也灭火！
You set your patients on fire.  I put them out.

712
01:08:22,013 --> 01:08:27,173
有些人跑得不够快，换个话题
Some not as quickly as others, but let's change the subject, shall we?

713
01:08:29,145 --> 01:08:34,585
未来比过去有趣多了 不是吗？
The future's so much more interesting than the past, don't you think?

714
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:41,409
恐怕凡艾可小姐爱上你了
Miss Van Eyck. I'm afraid she's already smitten.

715
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:46,318
她一直盯着你的“眼睛”
She only has eyes for you.

716
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:51,178
你一定在想，我怎么愿意帮你？
I know what you're thinking, John: How can I do what I do now?

717
01:08:51,502 --> 01:08:56,022
我花很多时间在监狱图书馆
Let's say that I spent an awful lot of time in the prison library.

718
01:08:56,382 --> 01:09:01,382
那是逃避监狱生活的好办法
That was a great way to avoid the more unpleasant aspects of prison life.

719
01:09:01,763 --> 01:09:05,003
囚禁是真正的教育
Confinement was a real education, a real...

720
01:09:07,268 --> 01:09:08,708
真正教人大开“眼”界
...eyeopener.

721
01:09:13,233 --> 01:09:16,273
那是真正的启蒙，有什么比得上…
For true enlightenment, there's nothing quite like...

722
01:09:16,570 --> 01:09:19,810
例如跟凶狠的重罪犯一起淋浴
...well, let's say, taking a shower while this large fellow...

723
01:09:20,157 --> 01:09:23,517
高大到拿一把铁锤也打不倒 听他在你耳边呢喃…
...with an attitude you can't knock down with a hammer...

724
01:09:23,827 --> 01:09:25,907
“噢，南希”
...whispers in your ear, "Oh, Nancy. "

725
01:09:26,163 --> 01:09:29,683
好玩喔，多谢你让我入狱
That was a lot of fun. Thank you for putting me there...

726
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:34,080
拓展我的生命领域
...and giving me the opportunity to get to know myself so much better.

727
01:09:34,422 --> 01:09:36,782
为了答谢你的恩泽
And now to return the favor.

728
01:09:48,269 --> 01:09:51,229
-你的作品？ -是的
This your work?  Yes.

729
01:09:52,024 --> 01:09:53,544
我很喜欢
I like it.

730
01:09:53,776 --> 01:09:56,736
-咖啡要加什么？ -奶精和糖
How do you take your coffee?  Cream and sugar.

731
01:09:57,029 --> 01:09:59,469
-我没有奶精 -糖就可以
I don't have any cream. Sorry.  Just sugar then.

732
01:09:59,740 --> 01:10:02,020
-你跟约翰常来？ -以前
You and John ever come here?  We used to.

733
01:10:02,285 --> 01:10:04,045
他现在不在这里吧？
He's not here now, is he?

734
01:10:06,288 --> 01:10:08,048
我不得不问
I had to ask.

735
01:10:10,542 --> 01:10:13,382
-糖也没有了 -谢谢
I don't have any sugar either.  Thank you.

736
01:10:13,671 --> 01:10:16,511
-他没跟你联络？ -没有
He hasn't tried to contact you?  No.

737
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:19,320
他有没有提过里欧克罗？
Did he ever mention the name Leo Crow?

738
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:22,354
没有，我已不太跟约翰通话
No, but I don't talk to John much anymore.

739
01:10:22,639 --> 01:10:26,079
-没看过他住的地方？ -那是我们以前的家
So you haven't seen his apartment.  That was our apartment.

740
01:10:26,393 --> 01:10:29,233
最近有去吗？到处都是这玩意
Have you been there recently? It's full of these.

741
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:33,961
-他嗑药多久了？ -从失去我们的儿子以后
How long has he been doping?  Since right after we lost our son.

742
01:10:34,318 --> 01:10:39,558
你是说他弄丢你的儿子以后？
那不是谁的错
You mean after he lost your son.  It was nobody's fault.

743
01:10:41,367 --> 01:10:45,367
但是，当时约翰 也在公共游泳池陪他
But John was with him at the public pool.

744
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:48,393
离婚书上，你说约翰企图自杀
You said in your divorce papers that John tried to kill himself.

745
01:10:48,666 --> 01:10:51,866
-那并不是自杀，我很后悔 -不然约翰做了什么？
It wasn't a suicide attempt.  What was it then?

746
01:10:52,169 --> 01:10:56,089
FBI找到我儿子的凉鞋
The FBI found something that belonged to my son, a sandal.

747
01:10:56,424 --> 01:10:57,944
约翰很激动…
John was upset. He...

748
01:10:58,218 --> 01:11:01,058
他拿着枪看家庭录像带
He took out his gun and watched home movies.

749
01:11:01,346 --> 01:11:05,466
-文件上都写着 -天花板被他打个洞，又怎样？
This is all in your statement.  He shot a hole in the ceiling. So what?

750
01:11:05,809 --> 01:11:09,329
换做你，你会怎么样？
You lose your son, let's see how well you handle it.

751
01:11:09,896 --> 01:11:14,776
你离开约翰是因为 他埋首在防罪中心的工作里
Lamar thinks you left John because he lost himself in Precrime instead of you.

752
01:11:15,486 --> 01:11:20,006
我离开他是因为 一看到他，我就想到儿子
I left him because every time I looked at him, I saw my son.

753
01:11:21,075 --> 01:11:25,355
靠近他就闻到我儿子的味道
Every time I got close to him, I smelled my little boy.

754
01:11:25,705 --> 01:11:28,225
所以我才离开他
That's why I left him.

755
01:11:29,334 --> 01:11:31,454
你可以走了
And now you can leave.

756
01:11:33,504 --> 01:11:36,544
12小时内绷带不要拿掉
Don't take the bandages off for 12 hours.

757
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:45,591
拿下会瞎掉，懂吗？
If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Understand?

758
01:11:46,894 --> 01:11:50,734
冰箱有牛奶 葛莉塔为你做了个三明治
In the fridge, there's milk. Greta made you a sandwich.

759
01:11:51,065 --> 01:11:53,785
多喝水
Make sure you drink a lot of water.

760
01:11:54,068 --> 01:11:55,988
怎么找洗手间？
How do I find the bathroom?

761
01:11:56,570 --> 01:11:59,970
洗手间？右手那条线
The bathroom? Now that's your right hand.

762
01:12:02,661 --> 01:12:05,181
左手的是厨房
The kitchen is your left.

763
01:12:07,498 --> 01:12:10,218
不要抓，千万不要抓！
Don't scratch. Never scratch!

764
01:12:10,752 --> 01:12:15,232
看老朋友份上，送你个礼物
Seeing as we're being pals, I'll give you a bonus that may come in handy.

765
01:12:15,590 --> 01:12:19,790
短效麻痹酵素，注射在下巴
This is a temporary paralytic enzyme. You're gonna shoot this under your chin.

766
01:12:20,304 --> 01:12:23,544
-这是什么东西？ -它会让你的脸肿得像猪头
What is this?  It'll turn your pretty face into mush.

767
01:12:23,849 --> 01:12:26,169
别人就认不出来了
People won't even recognize you.

768
01:12:26,435 --> 01:12:30,595
30分钟后恢复正常 但你会痛不欲生
In 30 minutes, it'll tighten up again. But it'll hurt like you've never felt.

769
01:12:30,940 --> 01:12:34,780
我把它放进你的宝贝袋
I'm gonna put this in your goodybag, together with your...

770
01:12:35,153 --> 01:12:36,913
跟老眼珠放一起
...leftovers.

771
01:12:38,656 --> 01:12:44,096
我定个时间，明天铃响 拆绷带离开
I'm setting up a timer. When it rings, you can remove the bandages and leave.

772
01:12:44,496 --> 01:12:48,296
-不能提早，不然… -会瞎掉，我知道
But not before then, or you will...  Go blind. I know.

773
01:12:48,625 --> 01:12:50,465
不要抓
Don't scratch.

774
01:12:51,503 --> 01:12:56,063
我们共同的朋友送的小礼物
A little something from a mutual friend of ours.

775
01:13:32,963 --> 01:13:35,443
12小时内不要拆绷带
Don 't take the bandages off for 12 hours.

776
01:13:36,508 --> 01:13:41,068
提早拆会瞎掉，懂吧？
If you take them off before then, you'll go blind. Understand?

777
01:14:01,952 --> 01:14:06,552
-2516秒，新纪录 -是世界纪录吗？
25. 16 seconds. That's a new record.  Is that a world record?

778
01:14:06,915 --> 01:14:10,275
世界纪录？个人最佳成绩
Is it a world record? It's a personal best.

779
01:14:10,586 --> 01:14:13,506
-换我帮你计时 -你在开玩笑
Now I wanna time you.  You gotta be kidding.

780
01:14:13,798 --> 01:14:16,638
我不可能打破2516秒
There's no way I can beat 25. 16 seconds.

781
01:14:16,926 --> 01:14:19,646
鲸鱼可以憋气多久？
How long can a whale hold its breath?

782
01:14:19,929 --> 01:14:22,009
大约20分钟
For about 20 minutes.

783
01:14:22,265 --> 01:14:25,465
-我们来打破鲸鱼的纪录 -好
So we gotta beat the whale.  Okay.

784
01:14:27,312 --> 01:14:29,632
我们来打破鲸鱼的纪录
We gotta beat the whale.

785
01:14:30,357 --> 01:14:31,637
拿着
Here you go.

786
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:35,578
20分钟，要不要去买冰淇淋？
It's gonna be 20 minutes. You sure you don't wanna go for an ice cream?

787
01:14:35,904 --> 01:14:38,784
因为我要打破鲸鱼的纪录
Because you know I'm gonna beat that whale.

788
01:14:39,324 --> 01:14:40,884
-好了吗？ -帮我倒数
Ready?  Give me the count.

789
01:14:41,118 --> 01:14:43,278
3，2，1，开始
Three, two, one, go!

790
01:15:01,097 --> 01:15:02,537
西恩？
Sean?

791
01:15:05,393 --> 01:15:06,553
西恩？
Sean?

792
01:15:09,564 --> 01:15:10,844
西恩？
Sean.

793
01:15:17,406 --> 01:15:19,086
你们有没有看到
Have you seen...?

794
01:15:20,701 --> 01:15:25,021
我在找儿子，他穿红色泳裤
I'm looking for my son. Have you seen a boy in a red bathing suit?

795
01:15:26,874 --> 01:15:30,234
你们有看到我儿子吗？ 他穿红色泳裤
You seen my boy? He's wearing a red bathing suit.

796
01:16:56,634 --> 01:16:58,067
警网最前线

797
01:17:18,449 --> 01:17:23,169
杰德，准备热感扫瞄 北鲍威尔街的所有住户
Jad, we're ready to begin thermal scan on all residences on North Powell.

798
01:17:24,414 --> 01:17:26,814
你一定很喜欢我，佛莱契？
You must really like me, don't you?

799
01:17:27,083 --> 01:17:29,843
所以你要我在这任务上搭档
That's why you asked to partner with me on this sortie.

800
01:17:30,128 --> 01:17:31,528
我觉得你是好同事
You're swell company.

801
01:17:31,754 --> 01:17:34,914
还是说你信不过我和老队长？
It's not that you don't trust me to be alone with the chief, is it?

802
01:17:35,217 --> 01:17:37,377
你觉得我会和他聊天闲晃？
That you think I might, you know, futz with him?

803
01:17:37,635 --> 01:17:41,355
我只想看他抓着你 撞破另一栋建筑物
No, I just wanna watch him use your body to sandblast another building.

804
01:17:41,682 --> 01:17:42,682
艾文纳，开始
Evanna, go.

805
01:17:43,184 --> 01:17:46,464
显示有27个温热物体
I show 27 warm bodies.

806
01:17:46,770 --> 01:17:49,490
收到，27个温热物体
Roger that. Confirmed, 27 warm bodies.

807
01:17:49,774 --> 01:17:54,534
-四只蜘蛛？每层楼一只？ -放八只，我想早点吃饭
Four spyders, one per floor?  Let's do eight. I gotta eat.

808
01:18:10,128 --> 01:18:15,128
931鲍尔街居民注意 这是预知犯罪中心的佛莱契警官
Residents of 931 Powell, this is Officer Fletcher of D.C. Precrime.

809
01:18:15,509 --> 01:18:20,589
根据犯罪防治法条授权 我们派遣蜘蛛搜索大楼
Under authority of P.C. section 6409, we are deploying spyders into your complex.

810
01:18:22,016 --> 01:18:24,296
妈妈，我好害怕
Mom, I'm scared.

811
01:18:24,602 --> 01:18:27,002
妈妈，我好害怕，妈妈
Mommy, I'm scared. Mommy.

812
01:18:27,271 --> 01:18:31,071
眼睛张开，躺着不要动
That's gonna scan you. Keep your eyes open. Stay still.

813
01:18:31,401 --> 01:18:33,161
-不要动 -很讨厌
It's okay.  I don't like it.

814
01:18:33,403 --> 01:18:35,403
不要动，不要动
Stay still. Stay still.

815
01:18:59,012 --> 01:19:00,132
来！
Come on!

816
01:19:00,347 --> 01:19:02,827
你又出去偷腥！
You stepped out on me for the last time.

817
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:04,620
我跟你说过我去了哪里！
I told you where I was.

818
01:19:04,852 --> 01:19:07,652
骗子！你昨晚跟那婊子在一起
You're a nogood liar. I know you was with that ho.

819
01:19:07,938 --> 01:19:09,498
你很幸运我们…
You're lucky we...

820
01:19:13,778 --> 01:19:15,778
不要再烦了！
Leave me alone!

821
01:20:32,194 --> 01:20:33,674
一个不见了
We lost one.

822
01:20:34,071 --> 01:20:37,871
收到，可能是猫跳过窗户
Roger that. Maybe it was a cat jumping through a window.

823
01:20:38,450 --> 01:20:40,050
这猫还真大
It's an awful big cat.

824
01:20:40,285 --> 01:20:41,605
佛莱契
Fletcher.

825
01:20:42,663 --> 01:20:44,543
我去看看
I'll go check it out.

826
01:21:23,080 --> 01:21:26,320
他们哭了！太恐怖了！
They're crying their eyes out. You terrified them.

827
01:21:26,625 --> 01:21:28,745
靠近我，他们更会吓死
Keep your kids away from me.

828
01:21:44,185 --> 01:21:48,385
等等，大猫回来了 可能是醉汉，醒不过来
The big cat's back. What do you think? A drunk, maybe can't wake up?

829
01:21:48,732 --> 01:21:51,252
也可能是某人想躲过搜查
Or a guy who doesn't want to get read.

830
01:21:51,526 --> 01:21:54,006
请安静，回到室内
Folks, be quiet, go back inside.

831
01:22:04,999 --> 01:22:07,119
安静，把门关上！
Be quiet and close the door.

832
01:22:14,258 --> 01:22:16,458
查出身份了，不是他
We got an ID. It's not him.

833
01:22:18,472 --> 01:22:21,232
-不要太张扬 -去吃饭吧
Standing down.  Let's eat.

834
01:22:34,739 --> 01:22:37,419
佛莱契，你来看看
Fletcher, take a look.

835
01:22:39,201 --> 01:22:42,281
房间里有四人，不是三人
There's four people in this room, not three.

836
01:22:42,580 --> 01:22:45,940
四人？安德顿，克罗 和一个戴太阳眼镜的人
Four? There's Anderton, Crow and the man in sunglasses.

837
01:22:46,251 --> 01:22:49,411
他就是外面戴太阳眼镜那位
The man in the sunglasses is outside the window.

838
01:22:52,007 --> 01:22:56,487
这里还有一个人 在镜子里
There's also someone here in the mirror.

839
01:22:57,345 --> 01:22:59,385
确定是女性
Definitely female.

840
01:22:59,932 --> 01:23:04,012
犯罪防治项目经联邦政府同意 在2046年开始施行
The Precrime program began in 2046 with a federal grant.

841
01:23:04,353 --> 01:23:09,393
经过九年后，哥伦比亚区 成了美国最安全的城市
And now, nine years later, D.C. is the safest city in America.

842
01:23:09,273 --> 01:23:12,056
为什么？因为犯罪防治有效
Why? Because Precrime works.

843
01:23:12,319 --> 01:23:15,439
它取代了传统的警察系统
Precrime has eliminated the need for conventional detectives.

844
01:23:15,740 --> 01:23:20,380
未来受害者被预知并受保护
What happens now is the verification and protection of future victims.

845
01:23:20,745 --> 01:23:22,305
可以看看先知吗？
Can we see the PreCogs?

846
01:23:22,539 --> 01:23:26,859
先知天生具有强大能力 他们必须处在与世隔绝的环境
They have such a powerful gift, they're kept in peaceful seclusion...

847
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,130
以免受到外界的干扰
...so as not to be distracted.

848
01:23:29,379 --> 01:23:33,699
这里可以看到他们的生活
This display should give you some idea of what their daily life is like.

849
01:23:34,635 --> 01:23:38,315
先知每年收到八百万封信
The PreCogs get over 8 million letters every year.

850
01:23:38,639 --> 01:23:40,559
比圣诞老公公收到的还多
That's more than Santa Claus gets.

851
01:23:40,808 --> 01:23:44,328
各自拥有卧室、电视和健身房
Each PreCog has their own bedroom, TV and weight room.

852
01:23:44,645 --> 01:23:46,725
当先知真好
It's wonderful to be a PreCog.

853
01:24:11,668 --> 01:24:14,654
我妈妈的新男朋友来访
My mom's new boyfriend came over again last night.

854
01:24:14,969 --> 01:24:17,129
他脑袋不太灵光
He's just not very intelligent.

855
01:24:17,387 --> 01:24:22,987
妈妈不让我在房间里吃饭 他逼我听她唠叨个没完
My mom wouldn't let me eat upstairs. I had to listen to him go on and on.

856
01:24:31,945 --> 01:24:33,625
可恶，可恶
Shit!

857
01:24:51,548 --> 01:24:54,268
眼珠扫瞄：约翰安德顿，允许进入
Eyedent: John Anderton. Approved for entry.

858
01:24:58,472 --> 01:25:02,232
…我会养，因为我很会照顾你们
Which I told her I'd be able to do. I'm so good at taking care of you.

859
01:25:02,560 --> 01:25:06,920
但她说我会不负责，乱讲
But she thinks I'll be irresponsible. It's ridiculous because...

860
01:25:09,609 --> 01:25:13,249
不！你不能进来，你想干嘛？
You can't be in here. What are you doing here?

861
01:25:17,868 --> 01:25:20,588
别跑，老头，谁让你进来？
Easy there, oldtimer. Who cleared you?

862
01:25:20,870 --> 01:25:22,830
-你不能进来 -听我说，华利
You're not allowed here.  Listen, Wally.

863
01:25:23,081 --> 01:25:24,761
-我认识你吗？ -我喜欢你
Do I know you?  I like you.

864
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:27,960
我不想动手动脚
So I don't wanna have to kick you or hit you.

865
01:25:28,254 --> 01:25:30,654
只要你肯帮我
But only if you promise to help me.

866
01:25:31,924 --> 01:25:33,764
嗨，约翰
Hi, John.

867
01:25:42,185 --> 01:25:44,505
他像谁？
Who does that look like to you?

868
01:25:46,105 --> 01:25:47,785
不知道
I don't know.

869
01:25:51,695 --> 01:25:55,815
是亚嘉莎 他到这里来找她
It's Agatha. He's coming here to get her.

870
01:25:58,160 --> 01:26:02,160
-这些是她的预视影像？ -我正在回转
Are these all of her previsions?  I'm rewinding her right now.

871
01:26:04,124 --> 01:26:06,404
帮我找出里欧克罗的谋杀案
Just take me to the Leo Crow murder.

872
01:26:06,669 --> 01:26:10,909
没有次序，按照她的原始输出
They don't come out in any order. I'm getting them as she's giving them.

873
01:26:14,177 --> 01:26:15,937
看到了吗？
Can you see?

874
01:26:29,442 --> 01:26:32,162
-他在里面 -他戴着面具之类的东西
He's inside.  He has some kind of mask on.

875
01:26:32,446 --> 01:26:34,326
-门被他封住了 -糟了
He sealed the door.  Shit!

876
01:26:34,572 --> 01:26:37,372
圣殿里不准用武器！ 用泡沫胶
Nobody fires a weapon inside the temple. Use bindfoam.

877
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:40,979
-有别的出口吗？ -所有门都守住了
Is there another way out of there?  All the doors are covered.

878
01:26:41,289 --> 01:26:46,689
约翰，离开乳液槽！ 不要靠近乳液槽，约翰！
John, move away from the tank. Move away from the tank, John.

879
01:27:04,104 --> 01:27:05,944
为什么要带走先知？
What does he want with a PreCog?

880
01:27:05,609 --> 01:27:09,270
你说呢？ 他想杀谁就没人知道啦！
So he can kill whoever he wants to without anyone knowing.

881
01:27:09,568 --> 01:27:14,608
但还有两位 华利！其它两位还有功能吧？
Well, there's still the other two. The other two can still function, right?

882
01:27:14,990 --> 01:27:21,030
不！他们的心智共通 三个一起才有预测功能
They're a hive mind. It takes all three for their predictive abilities to work.

883
01:27:23,415 --> 01:27:25,255
他们再也看不到凶杀案？
They can't see murders anymore?

884
01:27:25,501 --> 01:27:29,181
失去一个男性可能还可以 但亚嘉莎是关键
Agatha, she's the key. She's the one they listen to...

885
01:27:29,506 --> 01:27:31,626
她的能力最强，其它人都听她的
...the one with the most talent.

886
01:27:31,883 --> 01:27:35,163
-她会照顾其它两位 -天啊
She takes care of the other two.  Jesus.

887
01:27:35,470 --> 01:27:39,390
-把她找回来 -查出水管的流向
Please bring her back.  Every team underground, now!

888
01:27:39,209 --> 01:27:42,684
-没有用的 -在蓄水池拦下他
It doesn't matter. He wins.  We'll stop him.

889
01:27:42,978 --> 01:27:47,658
他杀克罗时她也在 她已经是他未来的一部分
She's with him when he kills Crow. She's already a part of his future.

890
01:27:48,024 --> 01:27:51,264
杰德，想办法查出那个房间
Jad, put everything you've got into finding that room, and we stop a murder.

891
01:27:51,570 --> 01:27:54,690
-还有多少时间？ -还有…
How much time have we got, Gordon?  We've got...

892
01:27:55,158 --> 01:27:57,598
51分30秒
...51 minutes, 30 seconds.

893
01:27:59,871 --> 01:28:02,751
你冷吗？ 你听得懂吗？
You cold? Can you understand me?

894
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:06,841
冷吗？ 你在颤抖是因为注射药剂
Are you cold? The shivers, it's the drugs we gave you.

895
01:28:07,170 --> 01:28:11,290
很快就会消退了 对不起，我需要你帮忙
It should wear off soon. I'm sorry. I need your help.

896
01:28:11,632 --> 01:28:15,272
你体内有我要的信息 我得知道怎么输出
You contain information. I need to know how to get at it.

897
01:28:16,471 --> 01:28:19,311
可以告诉我谁是里欧克罗吗？
Can you just tell me who Leo Crow is?

898
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,400
-这是现在吗？ -什么？
Is it now?  What?

899
01:28:21,643 --> 01:28:23,403
这是现在吗？
Is it now?

900
01:28:25,105 --> 01:28:28,465
是的，眼前的事物就是现在
Yes, this is all happening right now.

901
01:28:29,318 --> 01:28:31,438
我们会去到公共场所
I'm taking you some place in public...

902
01:28:31,695 --> 01:28:34,415
这表示我得帮你找些别的衣服
...which means you need something else to wear.

903
01:28:34,699 --> 01:28:38,579
我好累 我厌倦了未来
I'm tired. I'm tired of the future.

904
01:28:44,500 --> 01:28:47,580
宅本先生！欢迎光临Gap服饰
Hello, Mr. Yakamoto, welcome back to the Gap.

905
01:28:47,879 --> 01:28:51,079
上次买的无袖上衣喜欢吗？
How'd those assorted tank tops work out for you?

906

宅本先生？
Mr. Yakamoto?

907
01:28:57,890 --> 01:29:03,290
鲍小姐，还需要另一对羚羊皮鞋吗？
Miss Belfor, did you come back for another pair of those chammy laceups?

908
01:29:17,410 --> 01:29:21,570
-如果是绑架，怎么不开条件？ -不是绑架
If it's ransom, where's the damn note?  It has nothing to do with ransom.

909
01:29:21,915 --> 01:29:25,555
他要亚嘉莎体内的信息
It has to do with the information inside of Agatha.

910

-他想证明自己是无辜的 -但下载需要技术支持
He's trying to prove his innocence.  He can't download her without support.

911
01:29:31,592 --> 01:29:34,072
一般消费者买不到这种装备
Your average consumer can't buy any of this stuff.

912
01:29:34,344 --> 01:29:38,664
它得用订制零件组合而成
It's been assembled and scrounged from spare parts made to order.

913
01:29:40,059 --> 01:29:43,659
假如安德顿订制后 谁能帮他组合？
Assuming Anderton ordered this, who put it together?

914
01:29:53,239 --> 01:29:56,199
鲁法斯莱理是什么人？
Who's Rufus T. Riley?

915

918
01:30:08,088 --> 01:30:10,448
男人可以模拟女人的性经验

女人模拟跟偶像明星上床
Women come in to get laid by their favorite soap star.

920
01:30:14,761 --> 01:30:17,481
这一种最安全卫生，有益健康
Or just some good, clean fun.

921
01:30:20,226 --> 01:30:23,106
高潮迭起，但绝不得心脏病
It's a big rush, but you come out without a heart attack.

922
01:30:23,395 --> 01:30:26,115
我想杀我老板
I wanna kill my boss.

923
01:30:27,734 --> 01:30:28,854
没问题
Okay.

01:30:29,528 --> 01:30:33,328
-能提供我几个影像吗？ -鲁法斯！
You got some images I can work with?  Rufus.

925
01:30:33,823 --> 01:30:37,143
扮演费城爱乐指挥
Yeah, being concertmaster for the Philadelphia Symphony...

926
01:30:37,453 --> 01:30:39,133
很受欢迎
...is a popular choice.

927
01:30:39,371 --> 01:30:42,051
-不，我想杀我老板 -变态！
I wanna kill my boss.  You sick bastard.

928
01:30:42,332 --> 01:30:45,132
你这种人唯恐天下不乱
You make this a terrible world to live in!

929

没想到全天下条子都在找你
Detective, nice of you to come here, seeing how every cop is looking for you.

I need your help.  Why'd you come here?

-我可以到府服务 -我要你帮我跟她
I make house calls.  I need your help with her.

932
01:30:55,971 --> 01:30:59,451
哈，小甜心 不简单，一边逃亡
Hello, honey pie. I'm impressed. You're on the lam...

933
01:30:59,809 --> 01:31:03,849
还有时间搞艳遇
...and you still have the time to slice off a little... jerky for yourself.

934
01:31:04,188 --> 01:31:07,268
-她是先知 -靠，还是个先知
She's a PreCog.  Oh, yeah, okay.

935
01:31:07,567 --> 01:31:09,727
-是啊 -她是先知
That's right.  She's a PreCog.

936
01:31:11,613 --> 01:31:14,893
你把先知带来这里
You brought a PreCog here.

937
01:31:28,964 --> 01:31:30,884
我的老天啊
Jesus Christ.

938
01:31:31,467 --> 01:31:34,267
-你看到我心里想什么吗？ -起来
Are you reading my mind right now?  Get up.

939
01:31:34,244 --> 01:31:39,962
将来的事我很抱歉 过去的事不是我干的
I'm sorry for whatever I'm gonna do. I swear I didn't do that stuff I did.

940
01:31:42,562 --> 01:31:46,402
她体内有信息，我要下载出来
She has information inside her. I need you to get it out.

941
01:31:46,733 --> 01:31:49,813
不行，连怎么下手我都不知道
No way. I wouldn't even know where to begin.

942
01:31:50,112 --> 01:31:53,432
对艾莲娜表妹纯粹只是幻想
Those thoughts about my cousin were just thoughts.

943
01:31:53,740 --> 01:31:56,060
-你因为严重黑客行为被捕两次 -又怎样？
You've been busted for felony hacking.  So?

944
01:31:56,327 --> 01:31:58,647
用黑客技术侵入她
So I need you to hack into her.

945
01:32:01,271 --> 01:32:06,630
这样好了，我帮你 但取得的影像我要保留
I do this, I get to keep whatever images I get from her head.

-任何人都不该私自拥有 -带她去光华商场
They don't belong to anybody.  Take her to RadioShack.

947
01:32:12,510 --> 01:32:13,910
你一定得帮我
You're gonna help me.

948
01:32:20,393 --> 01:32:24,793
亚嘉莎，我想看我的未来
Agatha, I need to see. I need to see what's gonna happen to me.

949
01:32:26,191 --> 01:32:27,871
事成之后就离开
And then we'll go.

950
01:32:42,875 --> 01:32:45,315
-她真的行的通 -慢一点
She works.  Slow it down.

951
01:32:46,546 --> 01:32:50,186
怎么弄？打她的头不成？
How do I slow this down? I should hit her on the head?

952
01:32:56,222 --> 01:32:59,182
-有录下来吗？ -妈的
Are you recording this?  Shit.

953
01:32:59,893 --> 01:33:01,613
正在录
Yeah, recording.

954
01:33:28,215 --> 01:33:30,735
这里我看过，往前
I know this already. Come on. Move on.

955

再见，克罗
Goodbye, Crow.

956
01:33:36,557 --> 01:33:38,117
再见，克罗
Goodbye, Crow.

957
01:33:46,233 --> 01:33:48,353

What happened?  I don't know.

958
01:33:48,611 --> 01:33:50,211
-怎么了？ -不知道…
What happened?  I don't...

959
01:33:50,446 --> 01:33:53,726
-怎么回事？其它影像呢？ -可能只有这些
Where's the rest of it?  I guess that's all of it.

960
01:33:54,693 --> 01:33:59,082
我的关键报告呢？
Where's my Minority Report?

961
01:34:00,098 --> 01:34:02,944
到底存不存在？
Do I even have one?

962
01:34:07,239 --> 01:34:10,838
-到底有没有？ -没有
Do I have one?  No.

963

965
01:34:24,022 --> 01:34:27,605
亚嘉莎？怎么了？ 怎么了？
Agatha? What? What?

966
01:34:27,426 --> 01:34:30,663
-看到了吗？ -看什么？
Can you see?  See what?

967

You want me to see who killed Anne Lively. Are you recording this?

969
01:35:00,892 --> 01:35:04,317
有，可是，是倒转的

我喜欢我的生活，一切都美好

01:35:37,562 --> 01:35:39,541
我不配
I don't deserve that.

978
01:35:39,231 --> 01:35:42,168
-你最伟大 -不，你才伟大

979
01:35:48,540 --> 01:35:51,230
看到雨伞没有？

A man in a blue suit. He drops his briefcase.

983
01:36:04,623 --> 01:36:06,921
美国新闻 谋杀案件逼近

984
01:36:10,729 --> 01:36:15,099
穿棕色洋装的女人认出你的脸
You see a woman in a brown dress. She knows your face.

985
01:36:16,168 --> 01:36:18,564

1004

你还有选择，立刻离开
You have a choice. Walk away. Do it now.

1016
01:39:49,280 --> 01:39:53,342
不行，我想知道我怎么了
I can't. I have to find out what happened in my life.

1017
01:39:53,084 --> 01:39:54,779
求求你
Please.

1018
01:39:54,452 --> 01:39:58,994
我不会杀他，我根本不认识他
Agatha, I'm not gonna kill the man. I don't even know him.

1019
01:39:58,757 --> 01:40:01,452
-克罗住哪一间？
What room is Crow in?  1006.

1020

走吧
Come on.

1021
01:40:03,728 --> 01:40:05,456
走吧
Come on.

1022
01:41:24,175 --> 01:41:26,435
走错房间
Wrong room.

1023
01:41:54,739 --> 01:41:56,767

1025
01:42:54,732 --> 01:42:56,708
噢，天啊
Oh, God.

1026
01:43:01,005 --> 01:43:02,804
是西恩
This is Sean.

1027
01:43:02,907 --> 01:43:05,123
我儿子
My son.

1028
01:43:08,813 --> 01:43:14,884
过去六年的每一天 我只想着两件事：
Every day for the last six years I've thought about only two things:

1029
01:43:15,820 --> 01:43:20,611
第一是我儿子长大成人的模样
The first is what my son would look like if he were alive today...

1030
01:43:21,292 --> 01:43:25,476
在街上遇到，我认得出他吗？
...if I would recognize him if I saw him on the street.

1031
01:43:28,633 --> 01:43:32,779
第二是怎么对付绑走他的人？
And the second is what I would do to the man who took him.

1032
01:43:37,242 --> 01:43:39,371
你说对了
You're right.

1033
01:43:40,278 --> 01:43:42,495
没有人设计陷害我
I'm not being set up.

1034
01:43:45,149 --> 01:43:48,096
你得带我回家
You have to take me home.

1035
01:43:53,291 --> 01:43:57,628
你说过，没有关键报告
You said so yourself. There is no Minority Report.

1036
01:43:57,428 --> 01:44:00,597
未来是唯一的
I don't have an alternate future.

1037
01:44:01,366 --> 01:44:04,320
我一定会杀掉这个人
I am going to kill this man.

1038
01:44:06,604 --> 01:44:11,253
你还有选择 其它人没看过未来
You still have a choice. The others never saw their future.

1039
01:44:11,009 --> 01:44:14,116
你还有选择！
You still have a choice.

1040
01:44:14,579 --> 01:44:17,541
-里欧克罗？ -你是什么人？
Leo Crow?  Who the hell are you?

1041
01:44:23,154 --> 01:44:25,174
六年前在巴尔的摩，你在
Six years ago, Baltimore...

1042
01:44:24,822 --> 01:44:29,042
法兰西公共泳池绑走一个小孩
...you grabbed a kid at Francis public pool on the West End.

1043
01:44:28,893 --> 01:44:33,568
有吗？我一点都不记得
Did I? I don't remember anything about that place.

1044
01:44:37,302 --> 01:44:39,592
我是谁？我是谁？
Who am I? Who am I?

1045
01:44:39,304 --> 01:44:41,754
你知道我是谁吗？
Do you know who I am?

1046
01:44:41,472 --> 01:44:45,403
-你是某人的父亲 -他名叫西恩！
You're somebody's father.  His name is Sean!

1047
01:44:47,045 --> 01:44:48,592
西恩！
Sean!

1048
01:44:48,946 --> 01:44:52,471
我跟他说我是警察 我请他帮忙
I told him I was a policeman and needed his help.

1049
01:44:52,150 --> 01:44:57,604
我唱歌给他听 还买了个胡椒饼给他
It wasn't so bad. I sang him a song. I bought him a pretzel.

1050
01:44:57,388 --> 01:45:00,018
他很开心，他很开心
He was happy. He was happy.

1051
01:44:59,957 --> 01:45:03,322
他还活着吗？还活着吗？ 他在哪里？
Is he alive? He's alive. Where have you got him?

1052
01:45:03,027 --> 01:45:06,809
他好吗？ 他在哪，贱种？！
Is he all right? Tell me, you fuck, where is he?!

1053
01:45:06,531 --> 01:45:10,993
装在桶子里，沉进大海
I put him in a barrel. I sunk him in the bay.

1054
01:45:10,768 --> 01:45:14,325
它又浮上来 我抱他出来
He floated back up. I took him out.

1055
01:45:14,072 --> 01:45:17,702
我很温柔，我很温柔
I was gentle. I was gentle.

1056
01:45:18,309 --> 01:45:20,553
我对他很温柔
I was gentle.

1057
01:45:25,016 --> 01:45:26,790
对不起
I'm sorry.

1058
01:45:26,484 --> 01:45:28,170
对不起
I'm sorry.

1059
01:45:27,852 --> 01:45:29,587
对不起
I'm sorry.

1060
01:45:29,187 --> 01:45:30,923
对不起
I'm sorry.

1061
01:45:30,588 --> 01:45:33,580
真的很对不起
I'm so very sorry.

1062
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:38,254
你怎么可以这样对待我儿子？
How could you do that to my...?

1063
01:46:10,228 --> 01:46:12,964
你可以选择
You can choose.

1064
01:46:16,100 --> 01:46:18,325
你还可以选择
You can choose.

1065
01:46:26,244 --> 01:46:27,506
警示

1066
01:46:36,554 --> 01:46:39,723
你有权保持沉默
You have the right to remain silent.

1067
01:46:39,557 --> 01:46:44,606
你所说的话可能成为不利证词
Anything you say or do can be used against you in a court of law.

1068
01:46:44,896 --> 01:46:47,865
你有权聘请辩护律师
You have the right to an attorney...

1069
01:46:47,598 --> 01:46:52,377
代为回答任何询问
...now and during any further questioning.

1070
01:46:52,170 --> 01:46:55,485
如果你请不起律师
If you can't afford an attorney...

1071
01:46:57,208 --> 01:46:59,730
我们将为你指派一位
...we will appoint one.

1072
01:47:00,978 --> 01:47:04,247
了解你的权利了吗？
Do you understand these rights?

1073
01:47:04,749 --> 01:47:07,440
你不杀我？
You're not gonna kill me?

1074
01:47:09,754 --> 01:47:14,444
-你了解你的权利了吗？ -你不杀我？
Do you understand these rights?  You're not gonna kill me?

1075
01:47:16,928 --> 01:47:21,379
不按照计划进行 我家人什么都得不到
If you don't go through with this, my family gets nothing.

1076
01:47:21,132 --> 01:47:25,872
你该杀我啊！ 他说你会的
You're supposed to kill me. He said you would.

1077
01:47:26,737 --> 01:47:29,501
他？他是谁？
He? Who's he?

1078
01:47:29,173 --> 01:47:32,522
我不知道 他打电话到监狱给我
I don't know. He called me in my cell.

1079
01:47:32,210 --> 01:47:36,927
他说我答应的话，我会获释 家人可以得到一笔钱
He told me I'd be released if I went along, and my family would be cared for.

1080
01:47:36,681 --> 01:47:38,870
答应做什么？
If you did what?

1081
01:47:38,516 --> 01:47:40,425
答应做什么？
If you did what?

1082
01:47:41,552 --> 01:47:45,509
假装杀了你儿子，清楚吗？
If I acted like I killed your kid. Okay?

1083
01:47:46,824 --> 01:47:49,445
假装杀我儿子？
If you killed my kid?

1084
01:47:49,126 --> 01:47:53,340
你不杀我，我家人什么都没有
Look, you don't kill me, my family gets nothing. Okay?

1085
01:47:53,531 --> 01:47:56,321
照片哪里来的？
What about the pictures?

1086
01:47:56,567 --> 01:48:00,924
假的，他给我的
They're fake. He gave them to me.

1087
01:48:00,872 --> 01:48:03,822
听我说…
Now, listen to me. You...

1088
01:48:03,574 --> 01:48:07,051
跟我说是谁布的局？
You tell me: Who was it that set this up?

1089
01:48:07,812 --> 01:48:10,265
我不知道
I don't know.

1090
01:48:10,081 --> 01:48:12,680
-动手啊！ -我再问一次
Come on.  I'm asking you again:

1091
01:48:12,350 --> 01:48:16,012
-谁雇你的？ -我没看过他的脸
Who put you up to this?  I didn't see his face.

1092
01:48:15,720 --> 01:48:18,070
说出来，我家人什么都得不到
I tell you who, and my family gets nothing.

1093
01:48:17,722 --> 01:48:20,433
-跟我说 -杀了我
Who made you do this?  Kill me.

1094
01:48:20,091 --> 01:48:22,930
-动手杀了我 -说
You can do this. Kill me.  Tell me.

1095
01:48:22,627 --> 01:48:26,232
-杀我 -里欧，枪放开
Kill me.  Leo, let go of the gun.

1096
01:48:25,930 --> 01:48:28,850
枪放掉，不会有事
Let go of the gun. It's okay.

1097
01:48:30,568 --> 01:48:35,037
枪放掉，对 枪放掉
Let go of the gun. That's it. Let go of the gun.

1098
01:48:35,940 --> 01:48:38,540
你不杀我
You're not gonna kill me.

1099
01:48:38,709 --> 01:48:41,611
-再见，克罗 -安德顿，等等！
Goodbye, Crow.  Anderton, wait a sec...!

1100
01:48:55,226 --> 01:48:57,690
-你看到了吗？ -退后！
Did you see it?  Stay back!

1101
01:48:57,395 --> 01:49:00,137
发生什么事了？
What's happening down there?

1102
01:49:00,698 --> 01:49:02,795
谋杀！
Murder!

1103
01:49:02,567 --> 01:49:05,072
谋杀！
Murder!

1104
01:49:06,404 --> 01:49:08,347
不合常理
Doesn't make sense.

1105
01:49:07,972 --> 01:49:12,494
如果你是杀小孩凶手 会随便展示照片？
If you were a child killer, would you leave these photos out?

1106
01:49:12,243 --> 01:49:14,828
或许是安德顿拿出来的
Anderton might have found them.

1107
01:49:14,512 --> 01:49:17,880
-你以前在哪里服务？ -财政部
What kind of cop were you before this?  Treasury agent.

1108
01:49:17,582 --> 01:49:22,167
你第一次到凶案现场？ 我以前在重案组
This will be your first murder scene? I worked homicide before federal.

1109
01:49:21,919 --> 01:49:24,465
这正是所谓的“过度证据”
This is an orgy of evidence.

1110
01:49:24,121 --> 01:49:28,596
-猜猜我遇过几次过度证据的案子？ -几次？
Know how many orgies I had as a cop?  How many?

1111
01:49:28,359 --> 01:49:30,208
一次也没有
None.

1112
01:49:34,799 --> 01:49:37,234
这全是安排好的
This was all arranged.

1113
01:49:36,901 --> 01:49:42,399
今天发生了犯罪预防中心 开始六年后的首桩凶杀案
Today we saw the first murder in the six years of the Precrime experiment.

1114
01:49:42,173 --> 01:49:45,336
不幸，悲剧是因为人为疏失
Sadly enough, this failure was human.

1115
01:49:45,042 --> 01:49:48,812
保护小组未能及时拦阻
The protection team simply didn't get there in time.

1116
01:49:48,512 --> 01:49:53,956
但凶案本身 跟先知预测的完全吻合
But the murder itself happened exactly as the PreCogs predicted it would.

1117
01:49:53,751 --> 01:49:58,130
我们可以掀开一些 预犯系统的神秘面纱
Today's event put a human face on the Precrime system.

1118
01:49:57,888 --> 01:50:02,659
丹尼威妥来电 他说极为重要
Danny Witwer's on the phone. He says it's important.

1119
01:50:04,428 --> 01:50:06,566
拉玛？
Lamar?

1120
01:50:13,170 --> 01:50:15,767
-什么事？ -出问题了
What?  There's something wrong.

1121
01:50:15,506 --> 01:50:19,981
我们追错对象 电话不方便说
We're chasing the wrong man. I don 't wanna say over the phone.

1122
01:50:19,744 --> 01:50:21,995
安德顿家见
Meet me at Anderton 's.

1123
01:50:21,646 --> 01:50:25,274
从克罗的饭店房间找到的
We recovered that from Leo Crow's hotel room.

1124
01:50:30,354 --> 01:50:34,352
记得在巴尔的摩 我亲手交给他这个
I remember when I gave this to him, back in Baltimore.

1125
01:50:35,292 --> 01:50:37,431
请坐，先生
Please, sir.

1126
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:41,780
你找到些什么？
Tell me what you have.

1127
01:50:46,337 --> 01:50:50,245
这是安莉芙丽的谋杀案
This is the murder of a woman named Anne Lively.

1128
01:50:51,208 --> 01:50:55,647
约翰跟我说过 从看守所拿到的？
John told me about this. You got this from Containment?

1129
01:50:55,379 --> 01:50:58,898
对，是阿瑟和戴希尔的
Yes. This is from the twins, Arthur and Dashiell.

1130
01:50:58,582 --> 01:51:01,389
亚嘉莎的失踪了
Agatha's stream was missing.

1131
01:51:02,420 --> 01:51:05,467
这份来自“虚拟实境”
This one is from the Cyber Parlor.

1132
01:51:05,156 --> 01:51:10,657
安德顿从亚嘉莎身上载下来 鲁法斯莱理录下来的
Anderton downloaded this directly from Agatha. Rufus Riley recorded it.

1133
01:51:12,830 --> 01:51:17,052
-同样的预视影像 -不完全相同
It's the same prevision.  Not quite.

1134
01:51:18,302 --> 01:51:23,237
你看水面的风，注意涟漪
Look at the surface wind across the water. Watch the ripples.

1135
01:51:23,174 --> 01:51:26,517
从岸边向外波动
Moving away from shore.

1136
01:51:27,278 --> 01:51:32,526
第二份取自看守所的影像 阿瑟和戴希看到的
Now the second image, the one from Containment that Art and Dash saw.

1137
01:51:32,450 --> 01:51:34,858
注意看水
Watch the water.

1138
01:51:35,553 --> 01:51:40,985
风向变了 涟漪的波动方向相反
The wind's changed. The ripples are moving the other way.

1139
01:51:41,792 --> 01:51:45,761
凶案在不同的时间发生
This murder's taking place at two different times.

1140
01:51:45,496 --> 01:51:49,551
所长说 安德顿被通缉前看过这影像
Anderton was watching this right before he was tagged.

1141
01:51:49,300 --> 01:51:52,747
他跟我说过失踪的资料
He told me about the missing data stream.

1142
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:56,758
-他怕落到你手中 -对，我找到了
He was concerned you might find it.  He was right. I did.

1143
01:51:56,507 --> 01:51:58,683
影像一直在亚嘉莎体内
It was inside of Agatha.

1144
01:51:58,342 --> 01:52:03,799
为什么有人想删除档案？
So the question is, why would someone want this erased from the data file?

1145
01:52:03,581 --> 01:52:08,214
丹尼，直接告诉我你怎么想
Danny, just tell me what you're thinking.

1146
01:52:08,018 --> 01:52:11,436
我认为有个凶手逍遥法外
I'm thinking someone got away with murder.

1147
01:52:11,622 --> 01:52:13,344
怎么可能？
How?

1148
01:52:13,157 --> 01:52:18,127
杰德说先知会 重复看见同一凶案
Jad told me that sometimes the PreCogs see the same murder more than once.

1149
01:52:17,895 --> 01:52:22,200
-那称为回音 -杰德称之为前视印象
It's called an echo.  Jad called it PreCog deja vu.

1150
01:52:21,932 --> 01:52:25,967
我们要求技术人员将它剔除
We teach the techs to identify and disregard them.

1151
01:52:25,970 --> 01:52:31,692
没错，但是 如果技术人员误认是回音呢？
Yeah, but what if a technician only thought he was looking at an echo?

1152
01:52:31,509 --> 01:52:36,638
假如是另一桩凶案呢？
What if he was looking at a completely different murder altogether?

1153
01:52:36,413 --> 01:52:38,560
我不懂
I don't understand.

1154
01:52:38,315 --> 01:52:41,119
凶手只要雇人去杀安莉芙丽
All you'd have to do is hire someone to kill Anne Lively...

1155
01:52:40,785 --> 01:52:44,900
例如有毒瘾的流浪汉，一无所有
...like a drifter, a neuroin addict, someone with nothing to lose.

1156
01:52:44,622 --> 01:52:48,017
防罪中心一开始拦阻了凶案
Precrime stops the murder from taking place...

1157
01:52:47,691 --> 01:52:53,024
凶手戴了头铐，入了狱 但紧跟着，另外有人…
...haloes the killer, takes him away. But then, right then, someone else...

1158
01:52:52,797 --> 01:52:57,312
看过影像，装扮成凶手…
...having reviewed the prevision and dressed in the same clothes...

1159
01:52:57,034 --> 01:53:01,287
以同样手法执行谋杀
...commits the murder in exactly the same way.

1160
01:53:01,005 --> 01:53:06,769
技术人员以为是回音，删除掉
Technician takes a look, thinks he's looking at an echo, erases it.

1161
01:53:10,915 --> 01:53:16,135
一定是有权看影像的人
It'd have to be someone with access to the previsions in the first place.

1162
01:53:15,886 --> 01:53:18,499
某位高层人士
Someone fairly highup.

1163
01:53:20,157 --> 01:53:22,754
你听见我听到什么吗？
Do you know what I hear?

1164
01:53:23,894 --> 01:53:27,748
什么也没有 天花板没脚步声
Nothing. No footsteps up the stairs.

1165
01:53:27,498 --> 01:53:32,174
窗外没飞行器 没有蜘蛛的沙沙声
No hovercraft out the window. No clicketyclick of little spyders.

1166
01:53:31,902 --> 01:53:33,916
为什么听不到？
Do you know why?

1167
01:53:33,571 --> 01:53:37,423
先知看不到任何东西
Because right now, the PreCogs can't see a thing.

1168
01:54:01,866 --> 01:54:05,705
看到没？好美啊
Can you see? It's beautiful.

1169
01:54:05,669 --> 01:54:09,580
-我们要去哪里？ -安全的地方
Where are we going?  Someplace safe.

1170
01:54:16,447 --> 01:54:18,943
-我是伯吉斯 -拉玛，我是劳拉
Burgess.  Lamar, it's Lara.

1171
01:54:18,582 --> 01:54:21,631
-是的，劳拉 -请你一定要帮他
Yes, Lara.  You have to help him.

1172
01:54:22,286 --> 01:54:23,942
他在那里吗？
Is he there?

1173
01:54:25,689 --> 01:54:28,010
先知跟他在一起吗？
Is the PreCog with him?

1174
01:54:31,495 --> 01:54:34,559
留住他们，我马上过来
Keep them there. I'm on my way.

1175
01:54:34,231 --> 01:54:38,272
别告诉丹尼威妥，我信不过他
Please don't tell Danny Witwer. I don't trust him.

1176
01:54:39,169 --> 01:54:41,914
我绝口不提
I won't say a word.

1177
01:54:42,306 --> 01:54:46,602
不要让约翰离开，好吗？
You just don't let John leave, all right?

1178
01:54:47,778 --> 01:54:50,028
他不是凶手，拉玛
He's no killer, Lamar.

1179
01:54:50,080 --> 01:54:51,884
我知道
I know.

1180
01:55:03,060 --> 01:55:05,093
好冷
It's cold.

1181
01:55:09,566 --> 01:55:13,040
劳拉，她是亚嘉莎
Lara, this is Agatha.

1182
01:55:17,708 --> 01:55:23,414
记得我为你和西恩 念“汤姆历险记”吗？
You remember when I would read Tom Sawyer to you and Sean?

1183
01:55:25,883 --> 01:55:31,669
汤姆和贝齐在山洞失踪时 他好害怕
He got so scared when Tom and Becky were lost in the cave.

1184
01:55:33,757 --> 01:55:36,592
我想坐下来
I gotta sit down.

1185
01:55:36,894 --> 01:55:39,561
好好想清楚
I gotta figure this out.

1186
01:55:39,563 --> 01:55:42,310
一定得想出来
I gotta figure this out.

1187
01:56:21,305 --> 01:56:23,701
他们利用西恩
They used Sean.

1188
01:56:24,908 --> 01:56:28,251
让我误以为克罗杀了西恩
They wanted me to think Crow killed him.

1189
01:56:28,912 --> 01:56:31,016
但他没有
But he didn't.

1190
01:56:32,016 --> 01:56:34,023
他没有
He didn't.

1191
01:56:35,185 --> 01:56:38,274
他们为什么要陷害你？
Why would they set you up?

1192
01:56:45,396 --> 01:56:48,769
因为我发现她的事
Because I found out about her.

1193
01:56:49,199 --> 01:56:51,526
谁的事？
About who?

1194
01:56:51,201 --> 01:56:55,449
-我以前怎么没发现？ -发现什么？
How could I not have seen this?  Seen what?

1195
01:56:56,206 --> 01:56:58,814
安莉芙丽
Anne Lively.

1196
01:57:00,778 --> 01:57:02,842
亚嘉莎？
Agatha.

1197
01:57:07,017 --> 01:57:10,617
海曼博士说过“逝者未逝
Dr. Hineman once said, "The dead don't die...

1198
01:57:10,320 --> 01:57:12,912
他们依旧守护我们”
...they look on and help. "

1199
01:57:13,157 --> 01:57:15,908
记得吗，约翰？
Remember that, John.

1200
01:57:16,460 --> 01:57:18,205
亚嘉莎
Agatha.

1201
01:57:17,795 --> 01:57:19,980
西恩
Sean.

1202
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:26,536
他正在沙滩上
He's on the beach now...

1203
01:57:26,670 --> 01:57:29,422
脚趾泡着海水

1204
01:57:29,973 --> 01:57:33,319
他要你一起陪他
He's asking you to come in with him.

1205
01:57:33,477 --> 01:57:37,343
他在沙滩上跟妈妈赛跑
He's been racing his mother up and down the sand.

1206
01:57:38,682 --> 01:57:42,035
这个家有好多爱
There's so much love in this house.

1207
01:57:46,557 --> 01:57:48,998
他已经十岁了

1208
01:57:50,894 --> 01:57:54,056
被一群动物围绕着
He's surrounded by animals.

1209
01:57:54,798 --> 01:57:57,617
他想当兽医
He wants to be a vet.

1210
01:57:58,936 --> 01:58:04,107
你们让他养兔子、小鸟和狐狸
You keep a rabbit for him, a bird and a fox.

1211
01:58:05,175 --> 01:58:07,563
他念中学了
He's in high school.

1212
01:58:07,511 --> 01:58:10,858
他跟爸爸一样爱跑步
He likes to run, like his father.

1213
01:58:10,848 --> 01:58:14,675
他参加两里长跑和接力赛
He runs the twomile and the long relay.

1214
01:58:15,552 --> 01:58:17,826
他23岁了
He's 23.

1215
01:58:18,722 --> 01:58:21,477
他在念大学
He's at a university.

1216
01:58:21,425 --> 01:58:25,108
他跟美丽的克蕾儿做爱
He makes love to a pretty girl named Claire.

1217
01:58:24,795 --> 01:58:27,766
他向她求婚

1218
01:58:27,764 --> 01:58:31,973
他打电话告诉哭泣的劳拉
He calls here and tells Lara, who cries.

1219
01:58:33,003 --> 01:58:35,668
他继续跑步
He still runs...

1220
01:58:35,239 --> 01:58:40,039
约翰看着他跑在校园和体育馆
...across the university and in the stadium, where John watches.

1221
01:58:39,710 --> 01:58:44,782
他跑得跟他爸爸一样快
Oh, God. He's running so fast, just like his daddy.

1222
01:58:44,815 --> 01:58:49,593
他看见爸爸，他想跑向他
He sees his daddy. He wants to run to him.

1223
01:58:50,487 --> 01:58:55,625
但他只有六岁 他办不到
But he's only 6 years old, and he can't do it.

1224
01:58:55,559 --> 01:58:58,554
而且那个人太快了
And the other man is so fast.

1225
01:59:01,765 --> 01:59:05,127
这个家有好多爱
There was so much love in this house.

1226
01:59:05,736 --> 01:59:08,731
我好想要他回来
I want him back so bad.

1227
01:59:10,641 --> 01:59:13,050
她也一样
So did she.

1228
01:59:13,110 --> 01:59:15,472
你没看到吗？
Can't you see?

1229
01:59:18,649 --> 01:59:22,460
她希望她女儿回来
She just wanted her little girl back.

1230
01:59:24,021 --> 01:59:26,920
但来不及了
But it was too late.

1231
01:59:27,925 --> 01:59:31,081
她女儿走了
Her little girl was already gone.

1232
01:59:31,195 --> 01:59:33,454
她还活着
She's still alive.

1233
01:59:34,431 --> 01:59:36,946
她没死
She didn't die.

1234
01:59:36,700 --> 01:59:39,280
但她也不算活着
But she's not alive.

1235
01:59:40,470 --> 01:59:42,634
亚嘉莎？
Agatha?

1236
01:59:44,608 --> 01:59:46,644
跟我说
Just tell me...

1237
01:59:46,577 --> 01:59:49,284
谁杀了你母亲？
...who killed your mother?

1238
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:52,077
谁杀了安莉芙丽？
Who killed Anne Lively?

1239
01:59:53,050 --> 01:59:58,510
对不起，约翰 你又得逃了
I'm sorry, John, but you're gonna have to run again.

1240
01:59:58,755 --> 02:00:01,585
-什么？ -快逃！
What?  Run!

1241
02:00:17,808 --> 02:00:20,124
我爱你
I love you.

1242
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:23,749
-不会有事的 -跟他去，不会有事
It's okay.  You'll be fine with them.

1243
02:00:23,280 --> 02:00:26,711
-不！不！ -跟着我
No! No!  Stay with me. Stay with me.

1244
02:00:26,216 --> 02:00:29,352
-约翰，不 -不要说话
John, no.  Don't talk.

1245
02:00:46,203 --> 02:00:48,210
约翰安德顿
John Anderton.

1246
02:00:48,805 --> 02:00:52,638
根据特区犯罪预防中心的授权
By mandate of the D.C. Precrime Division...

1247
02:00:52,175 --> 02:00:57,896
你因为谋害克罗和威妥被捕
...I'm placing you under arrest for the murders of Leo Crow and Danny Witwer.

1248
02:01:00,550 --> 02:01:02,838
好了
That's it.

1249
02:01:02,586 --> 02:01:05,002
好乖
That's my girl.

1250
02:01:06,156 --> 02:01:09,108
我担心死了
I was so worried about you.

1251
02:01:12,496 --> 02:01:14,969
他有伤害你吗？
Did he hurt you?

1252
02:01:17,367 --> 02:01:19,647
我好想你
I missed you so much.

1253
02:01:19,136 --> 02:01:22,041
没关系了，有华利在
It's okay. Wally's here.

1254
02:01:22,105 --> 02:01:24,203
有华利在
Wally's here.

1255
02:01:28,679 --> 02:01:32,713
成了我的阶下囚了，约翰
You're a part of my flock now, John.

1256
02:01:32,316 --> 02:01:34,501
欢迎
Welcome.

1257
02:01:34,785 --> 02:01:39,882
里面其实挺舒服的 据说你会看到影像
It's actually kind of a rush. They say you have visions...

1258
02:01:39,489 --> 02:01:43,195
你的一辈子不停在眼前播放
...that your life flashes before your eyes...

1259
02:01:42,759 --> 02:01:46,809
你的梦想都会成真
...that all your dreams come true.

1260
02:01:54,305 --> 02:01:56,033
（约翰安德顿）

1261
02:02:02,946 --> 02:02:05,918
都是我的错
This is all my fault.

1262
02:02:06,216 --> 02:02:09,493
谁也改变不了这个事实
There was nothing anyone could do.

1263
02:02:13,290 --> 02:02:16,701
我猜你想拿回他的东西吧
I thought you might want to have those.

1264
02:02:21,865 --> 02:02:27,493
多年没穿，希望今晚能穿
I haven't worn this in years. I wanted to make sure it fits before tonight.

1265
02:02:27,137 --> 02:02:29,149
很好看
You look great.

1266
02:02:28,638 --> 02:02:33,450
我知道他有很多麻烦 但我却未伸出援手
I knew he was having trouble for some time, yet I did nothing.

1267
02:02:33,043 --> 02:02:37,192
-“今日美国”记者来了 -现在不行
The guy from USA Today is here.  Tell him not now.

1268
02:02:36,747 --> 02:02:40,823
-他只想… -没空！
He just wanted a few minutes before...  Not now!

1269
02:02:42,753 --> 02:02:46,910
-我以为你想退休了 -想过
I thought you were retiring.  Well, I was.

1270
02:02:46,523 --> 02:02:52,784
约翰的事让我感到系统的脆弱
But this incident with John made me realize the fragility of all this.

1271
02:02:52,829 --> 02:02:56,762
这里是约翰也是我的毕生结晶
This is John's legacy as much as it is my own.

1272
02:02:56,933 --> 02:03:01,012
我有义务保护它
Now I have an obligation to protect that.

1273
02:03:00,937 --> 02:03:05,095
我知道你难以接受
Lara, I know how difficult this is for you.

1274
02:03:04,674 --> 02:03:08,648
但，或许你可以放下心中的石头
But maybe you can find some closure in the fact...

1275
02:03:08,178 --> 02:03:13,233
约翰终于找出杀你儿子的凶手
...that John finally found the man who killed your son.

1276
02:03:15,485 --> 02:03:17,533
谁是安莉芙丽？
Who's Anne Lively?

1277
02:03:19,656 --> 02:03:22,784
-谁？ -安莉芙丽
Who?  Anne Lively.

1278
02:03:22,592 --> 02:03:27,104
他被捕前正谈到她
John was talking about her right before they took him.

1279
02:03:26,663 --> 02:03:29,511
我不知道她是谁
I don't know who that is.

1280
02:03:30,033 --> 02:03:35,768
他说他因为发现她所以被陷害
John said something about him being set up because he found out about her.

1281
02:03:35,439 --> 02:03:40,908
-但我们知道约翰为什么被通缉 -他还说克罗是个幌子
Well, we know why John was tagged.  He also said Crow was a fake.

1282
02:03:40,510 --> 02:03:45,638
威妥呢？他在约翰家中 被约翰的枪所杀
And Witwer? He was killed with John's gun inside John's apartment.

1283
02:03:45,215 --> 02:03:50,032
知道约翰来此工作的原因吗？
Do you know the reason why John came here to work for you?

1284
02:03:49,619 --> 02:03:51,691
-为了西恩？ -对
Sean.  Yes.

1285
02:03:51,788 --> 02:03:55,700
他到此工作，因为他以为
He came here to work for you because he thought...

1286
02:03:55,292 --> 02:04:00,443
防止类似的事情再发生
...if he could just stop that kind of thing from happening...

1287
02:04:00,530 --> 02:04:04,380
-我了解 -不，你不了解
I understand.  No, I don't think you do.

1288
02:04:03,934 --> 02:04:09,239
先生，他们两分钟后 要举行记者会
Sir, they wanna start the press conference in two minutes.

1289
02:04:08,839 --> 02:04:10,720
劳拉
Lara...

1290
02:04:10,507 --> 02:04:13,987
约翰是最顶尖的警察
...John was the best cop I ever knew...

1291
02:04:13,543 --> 02:04:17,033
某方面说，更是个好人
...and, in some ways, also the best man.

1292
02:04:16,546 --> 02:04:19,676
但每天带着那份伤痛
But the scars he carried around...

1293
02:04:19,149 --> 02:04:25,105
他会希望我们记得他好的一面
Well, I know he'd want us to honor the good things we remember about him.

1294
02:04:24,721 --> 02:04:30,932
我也知道他为什么跟你结婚 你跟他一样固执
And I also know why he married you: You're as stubborn as he is.

1295
02:04:30,594 --> 02:04:35,531
-拉玛 -你会打领带吧？
Lamar...  Do you know how to tie one of these?

1296
02:04:35,131 --> 02:04:40,118
可以帮个忙吗？我笨手笨脚
Could you please give me a hand? I'm all thumbs, as you see.

1297
02:04:47,377 --> 02:04:50,820
我会这么办
Listen, I'll tell you what I'll do.

1298
02:04:50,347 --> 02:04:55,222
到周一，我首先会调阅威妥的证物
First thing Monday, I'll look over the Witwer evidence.

1299
02:04:54,818 --> 02:04:59,085
我会请吉狄恩查看守所档案
And I'll have Gideon run the Containment files...

1300
02:04:58,655 --> 02:05:02,322
看有没有溺毙女性叫…
...see if anyone drowned a woman by the name of...

1301
02:05:01,858 --> 02:05:05,293
你说她叫什么名字？
What did you say her name was?

1302
02:05:06,730 --> 02:05:09,134
安莉芙丽
Anne Lively.

1303
02:05:09,065 --> 02:05:12,270
但我没说过她是溺毙的
But I never said she drowned.

1304
02:05:31,488 --> 02:05:36,868
-先生，记者会开始了 -我马上过去
Sir, the press conference is starting.  I'll be right there.

1305
02:05:40,964 --> 02:05:44,059
我们稍后再谈
We'll talk about this later.

1306
02:05:44,167 --> 02:05:49,308
明天或许到小屋拜访你
Perhaps tomorrow, I'll come by the cottage.

1307
02:06:25,508 --> 02:06:28,683
我想跟我先生说句话
I'd like a word with my husband.

1308
02:06:28,745 --> 02:06:32,417
你没有授权
You're not authorized.

1309
02:06:31,982 --> 02:06:35,350
你怎么进来的？
How did you get in here?

1310
02:06:43,393 --> 02:06:45,417
谢谢
Thank you.

1311
02:06:44,894 --> 02:06:50,759
各位女士先生，拉玛伯吉斯 新成立的国家预测犯罪局长
Ladies and gentlemen, Lamar Burgess, director of the new National Precrime.

1312
02:06:52,836 --> 02:06:57,325
我代表全体员工献给您
On behalf of your staff, we present you with this.

1313
02:06:56,906 --> 02:07:01,331
-恭喜 -哇！
Congratulations, sir.  My God.

1314
02:07:01,845 --> 02:07:04,055
你们怎么负担得起？
How did you get this?

1315
02:07:03,513 --> 02:07:07,283
我扣了你六个月特支费
I padded your expense account for six months.

1316
02:07:09,085 --> 02:07:13,511
这款左轮枪 是由士兵献给将军们的
Revolvers like this one were given to generals...

1317
02:07:13,089 --> 02:07:16,874
以纪念南北战争结束
...at the end of the Civil War by their troops.

1318
02:07:16,426 --> 02:07:20,972
枪膛内装填了 五发镀金子弹
The cylinders were loaded with five goldplated bullets...

1319
02:07:20,530 --> 02:07:24,460
五发镀金子弹，象征…
...to symbolize the end of the destruction and death...

1320
02:07:24,000 --> 02:07:27,163
终结撕裂国家的破坏与死亡
...that had ripped the country apart for five years.

1321
02:07:26,670 --> 02:07:30,793
防罪中心提升为国家机构后
Ladies and gentlemen, with Precrime going national...

1322
02:07:30,373 --> 02:07:34,983
或许可以期待一个时代的来临
...maybe we can all look forward to a time when none of us...

1323
02:07:34,544 --> 02:07:38,516
再也毋需发射任何一颗子弹
...will have to discharge another firearm ever again.

1324
02:07:39,182 --> 02:07:44,507
开始尽情享用！ 这是命令！
Now enjoy yourselves. Enjoy yourselves! That's an order.

1325
02:07:46,823 --> 02:07:51,698
周末可以常造访湖滨小屋了吧？
Does this mean we can finally use the lake house on weekends?

1326
02:07:53,863 --> 02:07:55,827
喂
Hello.

1327
02:07:55,331 --> 02:07:58,445
是的，马上
Yes. Right away.

1328
02:07:58,068 --> 02:08:01,840
-对不起，很抱歉 -对不起
Excuse me, so sorry.  Excuse me.

1329
02:08:01,438 --> 02:08:03,497
-局长？ -是的
Sir?  Yes.

1330
02:08:02,972 --> 02:08:07,280
你私人专线上有急电
Sir, you have an emergency call on your private line.

1331
02:08:07,744 --> 02:08:10,157
伯吉斯
Yes, this is Burgess.

1332
02:08:09,612 --> 02:08:14,793
哈，拉玛，恭喜 你成功了
Hello, Lamar. I just wanted to congratulate you. You did it.

1333
02:08:14,384 --> 02:08:17,549
你创造了一个没有凶杀案的世界
You created a world without murder.

1334
02:08:17,053 --> 02:08:20,858
大家想请你在帽子上签名，可以吗？
Everyone wants your name on a hat. Can you sign these?

1335
02:08:20,390 --> 02:08:23,515
你只要踩着别人的尸体往前走
All you had to do was kill someone to do it.

1336
02:08:27,597 --> 02:08:29,371
分析室，杰德
Aroom. Jad.

1337
02:08:29,632 --> 02:08:33,615
杰德，是劳拉，约翰请你帮个忙
Jad, it's Lara. John needs a favor.

1338
02:08:33,169 --> 02:08:38,360
-什么意思？ -亚嘉莎的母亲，安莉芙丽
What are you talking about?  Agatha 's mother, Anne Lively.

1339
02:08:37,907 --> 02:08:42,875
一位放弃孩子的死毒鬼
Just a junkie who had a kid once and had to give her up, but surprise!

1340
02:08:42,412 --> 02:08:46,060
没想到她戒了毒 想接女儿回家
She cleaned herself up, and she wanted her daughter back.

1341
02:08:45,548 --> 02:08:48,228
她想要回亚嘉莎
She wanted Agatha.

1342
02:08:49,986 --> 02:08:55,051
杰德，你看，只有亚嘉莎的影像 没有时间也没有附属数据
Jad, you getting this? It's from the female only. No time or incident data.

1343
02:08:54,591 --> 02:08:57,759
这不是未来，已经发生过了
It isn't the future. It already happened.

1344
02:08:57,227 --> 02:09:01,628
问题是，没有亚嘉莎 就没有防罪中心
And the problem was, without Agatha, there was no Precrime.

1345
02:09:01,131 --> 02:09:06,548
她一直是三位中最强的一位 没有亚嘉莎一切将化为乌有
She's the strongest of the three. Without Agatha, you had nothing.

1346
02:09:06,102 --> 02:09:12,111
没有她，你怎么可能 站在那里为大家签名
You wouldn't be where you are now, standing there, signing autographs.

1347
02:09:19,382 --> 02:09:23,455
-杰德，你在干嘛？ -你在干嘛？
What are you doing?  What are you doing with that?

1348
02:09:22,952 --> 02:09:27,202
-你想干嘛，大个子？ -传送前先想清楚
What you up to, big man?  Think before you send that.

1349
02:09:26,756 --> 02:09:28,516
慢一点
Slow down.

1350
02:09:48,344 --> 02:09:53,684
所以你不得不除掉安莉芙丽 真是项大工程
Now you had to get rid of Anne Lively, which presented a problem:

1351
02:09:53,183 --> 02:09:57,564
你怎么杀她又不被先知看见？
How can you kill her without the PreCogs seeing it?

1352
02:09:57,086 --> 02:10:01,961
很简单，利用你控制的系统
Simple. Use a system you control against her.

1353
02:10:01,524 --> 02:10:07,345
你雇杀手杀她 你知道先知会看见
You hired someone to kill her, knowing the PreCogs would see that murder.

1354
02:10:06,896 --> 02:10:11,125
你引诱安莉芙丽到湖边
You lured Anne Lively out to the lake...

1355
02:10:10,633 --> 02:10:15,277
承诺让她母女团圆
...with the promise of reuniting her with her daughter.

1356
02:10:59,115 --> 02:11:01,867
我女儿呢？
Where's my daughter?

1357
02:11:08,391 --> 02:11:10,366
哪里？
Where?

1358
02:11:11,661 --> 02:11:13,699
看！
Run!

1359
02:11:16,399 --> 02:11:18,252
快逃！
Run!

1360
02:11:29,078 --> 02:11:33,136
四下无人时，你亲手杀了她
When you were all alone, you killed her yourself...

1361
02:11:32,615 --> 02:11:37,239
使用与凶手同样的手法
...in the same way the PreCogs predicted your John Doe would kill her.

1362
02:11:36,753 --> 02:11:40,369
让实际谋杀看起来像回音
You made the real murder look like an echo...

1363
02:11:39,822 --> 02:11:45,215
而技术人员做了他们该做的： 不理会它
...knowing the tech would do what he was trained to do: Disregard it.

1364
02:11:50,400 --> 02:11:55,446
安莉芙丽变成另一个失踪人口
Anne Lively became just another missing person.

1365
02:11:55,471 --> 02:11:59,296
你现在怎么办，拉玛？
So, what are you gonna do, Lamar?

1366
02:11:59,375 --> 02:12:02,016
你要怎么办？
What are you gonna do?

1367
02:12:12,422 --> 02:12:14,511
红球状况！
We got a Red Ball!

1368
02:12:17,660 --> 02:12:19,651
（被害人 约翰安德顿）

1369
02:12:19,929 --> 02:12:23,540
想想小女孩救过的生命
Think about the lives that little girl has saved.

1370
02:12:22,999 --> 02:12:26,586
想想小女孩救过的生命
Think about the lives that little girl has saved.

1371
02:12:26,069 --> 02:12:31,271
想想其它可以被拯救的生命
那小女孩可以救西恩
Think of all the lives she will save. She could have saved Sean.

1372
02:12:30,807 --> 02:12:34,105
不准你说他的名字！
Don't you ever say his name!

1373
02:12:35,611 --> 02:12:39,463
你利用我对亡儿的思念陷害我
You used the memory of my dead son to set me up.

1374
02:12:38,948 --> 02:12:42,639
你利用我对亡儿的思念陷害我
You used the memory of my dead son to set me up.

1375
02:12:42,085 --> 02:12:45,809
你知道我会为他杀人
You knew that would drive me to murder.

1376
02:12:45,288 --> 02:12:49,379
-你现在怎么办，拉玛？ -你现在怎么办，拉玛？
What are you gonna do now, Lamar?  What are you gonna do now, Lamar?

1377
02:12:48,858 --> 02:12:51,606
-你要怎么 -封住我的嘴？
How are you gonna...?  Shut me up?

1378
02:12:51,027 --> 02:12:54,095
原谅我，约翰
Forgive me, John.

1379
02:13:01,704 --> 02:13:04,253
原谅我，约翰
Forgive me, John.

1380
02:13:08,411 --> 02:13:10,971
（凶手 拉玛伯吉斯）

1381
02:13:15,084 --> 02:13:17,202
拉玛
Lamar.

1382
02:13:16,853 --> 02:13:19,034
结束了
It's over.

1383
02:13:18,955 --> 02:13:24,839
剩下的唯一问题是，你怎么收场？
The question you have to ask is, what are you gonna do now?

1384
02:13:37,440 --> 02:13:41,157
毫无怀疑，先知已看见此事
No doubt the PreCogs have already seen this.

1385
02:13:40,643 --> 02:13:43,049
没错
No doubt.

1386
02:13:43,312 --> 02:13:46,358
你了解两难之处了吧？
You see the dilemma, don't you?

1387
02:13:46,315 --> 02:13:51,361
不杀我，表示先知错了 犯罪防治中心跟着完蛋
If you don't kill me, PreCogs were wrong and Precrime is over.

1388
02:13:51,754 --> 02:13:55,985
杀我，你前途就毁了
If you do kill me, you go away...

1389
02:13:55,792 --> 02:14:00,912
但证明系统有效，先知正确
...but it proves the system works. PreCogs were right.

1390
02:14:06,402 --> 02:14:10,424
所以，你该怎么办？
So, what are you gonna do now?

1391
02:14:11,040 --> 02:14:13,776
代价是什么？
What's it worth?

1392
02:14:13,876 --> 02:14:16,891
只不过是另一桩谋杀
Just one more murder.

1393
02:14:19,015 --> 02:14:24,742
你戴着头铐在地狱腐烂 但民众还是相信防罪中心
You'll rot in hell with a halo, but people will still believe in Precrime.

1394
02:14:24,287 --> 02:14:28,999
你只需杀了我，就像先知预测的
All you have to do is kill me, like they said you would.

1395
02:14:31,694 --> 02:14:34,022
除非
Except...

1396
02:14:34,130 --> 02:14:37,323
你知道自己的未来
...you know your own future...

1397
02:14:36,799 --> 02:14:41,113
也就是你能任意改变未来
...which means you can change it if you want to.

1398
02:14:41,504 --> 02:14:45,224
你还有选择，拉玛
You still have a choice, Lamar.

1399
02:14:44,974 --> 02:14:47,608
跟我一样
Like I did.

1400
02:14:51,514 --> 02:14:54,996
没错，我还有选择
Yes, I have a choice...

1401
02:14:55,585 --> 02:14:58,322
而且已经选好了
...and I made it.

1402
02:14:58,488 --> 02:15:01,242
原谅我，约翰
Forgive me, John.

1403
02:15:02,091 --> 02:15:04,629
原谅我
Forgive me.

1404
02:15:09,132 --> 02:15:11,598
原谅我，孩子
Forgive me, my boy.

1405
02:15:29,485 --> 02:15:31,832
拉玛！
Lamar!

1406
02:15:42,298 --> 02:15:47,716
2054年，实验六年之后 预测犯罪计划终遭放弃
In 2054, the sixyear Precrime experiment was abandoned.

1407
02:15:54,510 --> 02:15:58,699
所有囚犯无条件无罪释放
All prisoners were unconditionally pardoned and released...

1408
02:15:58,147 --> 02:16:03,130
虽然几位仍被警方追踪数年
...although police departments kept watch on many of them for years.

1409
02:16:50,233 --> 02:16:53,344
亚嘉莎与双胞胎
Agatha and the twins...

1410
02:16:52,768 --> 02:16:56,848
被移至一隐密场所
...were transferred to an undisclosed location...

1411
02:16:57,006 --> 02:17:01,260
一个他们能发挥天赋的地方
...a place where they could find relief from their gifts...

1412
02:17:00,843 --> 02:17:05,540
得以平静的安度余生
...a place where they could live out their lives in peace.

1413
02:18:33,469 --> 02:18:37,235
谢谢观赏

1414
02:21:59,742 --> 02:22:04,873
纪念麦克马西亚
