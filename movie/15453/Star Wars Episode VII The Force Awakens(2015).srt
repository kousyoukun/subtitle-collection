很久很久以前，在遥远的银河系
A long time ago in a galaxy far far away....

Episode Vll THE FORCE AWAKENS

天行者Luke失踪了
Luke Skywalker has vanished.

00:00:35,654 --> 00:00:37,402
在这期间，邪恶力量
In his absence, the sinister

“第一秩序”从帝国的
FIRST ORDER has risen from

残余势力中崛起

00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:42,545
他们以消灭
and will not rest until

最后的绝地武士 - 天行者

00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,068
为己任

Leia Organa将军
REPUBLIC, General Leia Organa

她不顾一切地寻找
She is desperate to find her

希望能在他的帮助下恢复
help in restoring peace

18
00:00:57,028 --> 00:00:59,330
银河系的和平与正义
and justice to the galaxy.

19
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:01,571
Leia指派最勇敢的
Leia has sent her most daring

20
00:01:01,596 --> 00:01:03,448
飞行员前往贾库行星
pilot on a secret mission
[Jakku:贾库是外环偏远地区的一颗沙漠行星，遍地盗贼、暴徒、逃犯和拾荒者，和塔图因十分相似]

21
00:01:03,473 --> 00:01:05,040
执行一项秘密任务
to Jakku, where an old ally

22
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:06,926
那里的盟友发现了有关
has discovered a clue to

Luke下落的线索
Luke's whereabouts . . . .

24
00:02:43,285 --> 00:02:46,283
这个将把事情拉上正轨
This will begin to make things right.

25
00:02:46,602 --> 00:02:49,650
我已经走得太远看得太多
I've traveled too far and seen too much

26
00:02:49,651 --> 00:02:52,588
而忽视了银河系的绝望
to ignore the despair in the Galaxy.

27
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:57,385
没有绝地武士就没有任何原力的平衡
Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force.

28
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,847
现在,因为你，我们有了这个机会
Well, because of you, now we have a chance.

29
00:02:59,872 --> 00:03:02,175
Leia将军找这个已经找了很久
The general has been after for this for a long time.

30
00:03:02,176 --> 00:03:03,931
将军？
The General?

31
00:03:03,956 --> 00:03:06,342
于我而言她是皇室
To me she's royalty.

32
00:03:06,343 --> 00:03:08,609
当然，她肯定是
Well, she certainly is that.

33
00:03:14,095 --> 00:03:16,010
有人来了
We got company.

34
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,607
你得躲起来
You have to hide.

35
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:31,490
你得离开这儿
You have to leave.

36
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:34,667
快走
Go.

37
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:54,057
出去！走！走！走！
Get out! Go! Go! Go!

38
00:04:05,397 --> 00:04:07,542
快点BB-8，赶紧的！
Come on BB-8, hurry!

39
00:04:20,049 --> 00:04:22,915
轰了那个X翼战机！开火！开火！
Blast that X-wing! Fire! Fire!
[X-wing:X翼战机，印康公司生产的星际战斗机，在银河内]
[战的大部分时间里，X翼战斗机都是反抗军联盟的中流砥柱]

40
00:04:27,473 --> 00:04:28,716
后面有人来了
Someone is coming behind us.

41
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:30,134
我看到了！
I see him!

42
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,604
把这个收好，这个跟着你更安全
And take this, it's safer with you than it's with me.

43
00:05:05,079 --> 00:05:07,982
尽可能的远离这儿
You get as far away from here as you can.

44
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:09,878
- 听到了吗？  - 我不知道...
- Do you hear me?  - I don't know...

45
00:05:09,903 --> 00:05:11,839
我会去找你的
I'll come back for you!

46
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:13,826
我们会没事的
We'll be alright!

47
00:06:12,526 --> 00:06:14,390
继续走！
Keep moving!

48
00:06:16,231 --> 00:06:17,797
待在这儿
Stay here.

49
00:06:40,929 --> 00:06:43,893
看看你都变得多老了
Look how old you'd become.

50
00:06:44,264 --> 00:06:47,423
你变得比我还糟糕
Something far worse has happened to you.

51
00:06:48,089 --> 00:06:50,443
你知道我为什么来这儿
You know what I've come for.

52
00:06:50,477 --> 00:06:52,534
我只知道在你自称“Kylo Ren”
I know where you come from.

53
00:06:52,559 --> 00:06:55,050
之前来自何处
Before you you call 'Kylo Ren'.

54
00:06:55,075 --> 00:06:59,366
我们知道你找到了天行者的地图
The Map, to Skywalker. We know you found it.

55
00:06:59,571 --> 00:07:02,141
现在你要把它交给“第一秩序”
And now you're going to give it to the First Order.

56
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,249
第一秩序源自黑暗势力
The First Order rose from the dark side.

57
00:07:05,274 --> 00:07:06,782
但你不是
You did not.

58
00:07:07,027 --> 00:07:10,276
那我就让你瞧瞧黑暗势力
I'll show you the dark side.

59
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:11,846
你可以试下
You may try.

60
00:07:12,117 --> 00:07:16,767
不过你不能否认那是你的家人
But you cannot deny the truth that is your family.

61
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,638
没错
You're so right.

62
00:07:52,075 --> 00:07:54,900
呃，谁先说？你先说？我先说？
So, who talks first? Do you talk first? I talk first?

63
00:07:55,238 --> 00:07:56,999
那老头把它交给了你
The old man gave it to you.

64
00:07:57,024 --> 00:07:59,008
所有这些都很难理解....
It's very hard to understand you with all the...

65
00:07:59,038 --> 00:08:01,613
- 搜他身  - 我...
- Search him. - I'm more than...

66
00:08:04,798 --> 00:08:07,426
- 没找到，长官   - 把他带上飞船
- Nothing, sir. - Bring him on board.

67
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:15,993
长官，这些土著怎么办？
Sir, the villagers?

68
00:08:17,686 --> 00:08:19,367
全杀了
Kill them all.

69
00:08:20,353 --> 00:08:22,246
听我指挥
On my command.

70
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:24,415
开火
Fire!

71
00:08:25,417 --> 00:08:26,993
不！
No!

72
00:08:55,035 --> 00:08:57,489
什么也别留下，全部毁掉！
Nothing here! Eliminate it!

73
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:01,530
啊？
Huh?

74
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,380
行了.行了！
Alright. Alright!

75
00:10:05,794 --> 00:10:07,865
FN-2187.  FN-2187.
[FN-2187:Finn的编号，此处是个彩蛋，2187是《新希望》中帝国军关押Leia公主的牢房号码]

76
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:11,206
把你的爆能枪交上来检查
Submit your blaster for inspection.
[blaster:爆能枪，银河系的军民两用标准远程武器，可发射被称为“能量束”的]
[能量脉冲.爆能枪虽然能造成灼热的震荡波，但无法穿透磁密封装置或偏导护盾.]

77
00:10:11,385 --> 00:10:13,011
是，队长
Yes, Captain.

78
00:10:13,036 --> 00:10:16,218
谁允许你把头盔脱下来了？
And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?

79
00:10:16,286 --> 00:10:17,381
对不起，队长
I'm sorry, Captain.

80
00:10:17,406 --> 00:10:20,492
立即回部队报道
Report to my division at once.

81
00:13:05,266 --> 00:13:08,631
今天你带来的这玩意儿只值
What you brought me today is worth...

82
00:13:11,731 --> 00:13:15,232
四分之一的口粮
One quarter portion.

83
00:14:54,828 --> 00:14:56,062
啥？
Huh?

84
00:15:02,449 --> 00:15:04,274
哦，谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

85
00:15:12,879 --> 00:15:14,150
嘘
Shhh.

86
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:18,760
那个是蒂多，他想要你身上的零件
That's just a Teedo. Wants you for parts.
[Teedo：蒂多，身材矮小的野蛮拾荒者，由世界上最矮的替身演员Kiran Shah饰演,]
[经常骑着被厚重甲板所覆盖的半机械动物驮甲兽（Luggabeast）在贾库的荒地上游荡]
[驮甲兽被星球原住民当作吃苦耐劳的驮畜，作用和塔图因星球的班萨类似.]

87
00:15:18,785 --> 00:15:21,248
他是个野蛮的原始货
He has no respect for anyone.

88
00:15:21,273 --> 00:15:22,822
哦
Oh.

89
00:15:24,405 --> 00:15:26,059
你的天线弯了
Your antenna's bent.

90
00:15:35,246 --> 00:15:36,555
你从哪来的？
Where'd you come from?

91
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,684
我不能告诉你, 这是秘密
I am not suppose to tell, it's classified.

92
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:41,405
- 秘密，不是吧？  - 是的
- Classified, really?  - Yup.

93
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,735
我也是. 很大的秘密
Me too. Big secret.

94
00:15:44,029 --> 00:15:47,215
Niima 前哨在那边，不要靠近Kelvin Ridge
Niima Outpost is that way. Stay off Kelvin Ridge.
[Niima Outpost：Niima贸易哨站是Jakku唯一的贸易集散地，因而成为最大的定居点.]

95
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,054
远离北边的流沙区域
Keep away from the sinking fields in the North

96
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:51,194
否则你会淹死在沙漠里
or you'll drown in the sand.

97
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,171
你真好，我想和你待在一起
You are so very kind. I would like to come with you.

98
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:58,856
别跟着我，镇子在那边.
Don't follow me. The town is that way.

99
00:15:58,881 --> 00:16:02,060
哦.那么,我可以和你待一起吗？
Oh. Then, can I stay with you?

100
00:16:02,085 --> 00:16:03,685
别！
No!

101
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:06,375
伦家好怕怕嘛
I am scared.

102
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:16,333
耶！
Yay!

103
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:21,203
明天一早你就走.
In the morning, you go.

104
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,962
再次谢谢你.
Thank you, again.

105
00:16:26,774 --> 00:16:28,282
不用客气.
You're welcome.

106
00:16:39,559 --> 00:16:44,060
我们居然抓到了抵抗组织最优秀的驾驶员
I have no idea we had the best pilot in the Resistance on board.

107
00:16:45,974 --> 00:16:47,522
你爽不爽?
You comfortable?

108
00:16:47,547 --> 00:16:49,192
不太爽
Not really.

109
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:51,972
嗯，不错嘛.
I'm impressed.

110
00:16:53,856 --> 00:16:56,485
没人能把你从这儿救出去
No one has been able to get out of you

111
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:59,711
地图在哪儿？
what you did with the map？

112
00:16:59,736 --> 00:17:02,467
你可能要重新考虑下审问技巧
You might want to rethink your technique.

113
00:17:18,615 --> 00:17:20,136
地图在哪儿？
Where is it?

114
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:26,245
抵抗力量是不会被你吓到的
The Resistance will not be intimidated by you.

115
00:17:29,612 --> 00:17:32,854
它在哪儿？
Where is it?

116
00:17:38,295 --> 00:17:40,284
啊~~~
AAWWWW !!

117
00:17:42,423 --> 00:17:45,296
地图藏在一个BB机器人那儿.
It's in a droid. A BB unit.

118
00:17:45,321 --> 00:17:47,854
那样的话，如果它在贾库星，我们很快就能找到.
Well then, if it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it.

119
00:17:47,879 --> 00:17:49,924
这个任务就交给你了
I leave that to you.

120
00:17:51,498 --> 00:17:54,438
不要放弃希望，你等的那个人
Don't give up hope. He still might show up.

121
00:17:54,463 --> 00:17:58,467
还是有可能会来的.机密同学.
Whoever it's you're waiting for. Classified.

122
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:00,907
关于等待我可知道不少
I know all about waiting

123
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,328
是我的家人
For my family.

124
00:18:04,621 --> 00:18:07,634
总有一天他们会回来的
They'll be back, one day.

125
00:18:08,124 --> 00:18:09,505
过来
Come on.

126
00:18:12,116 --> 00:18:15,682
这五块破烂值...
These five pieces are worth...

127
00:18:15,707 --> 00:18:17,547
让我想下...
Let me see...
[我不会告诉你这货是西蒙.佩吉演的]

128
00:18:18,653 --> 00:18:21,288
一份半的口粮
One half portion.

129
00:18:21,313 --> 00:18:23,045
上周还是每个都值半份口粮呢
Last week they were a half portion each.

130
00:18:23,046 --> 00:18:25,146
这机器人怎么样?
What about the droid?

131
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:28,880
他怎么了?
What about him?

132
00:18:28,905 --> 00:18:31,136
我想买他
I'll pay for him.

133
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:36,365
哇
Wow.

134
00:18:37,009 --> 00:18:38,967
60份口粮.
60 portions.

135
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:41,049
- 哇    - 哇
- Whoa.  - Wow.

136
00:18:51,257 --> 00:18:52,921
实际上.
Actually.

137
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,181
这机器人是不卖的.
The droid is not for sale.

138
00:18:58,432 --> 00:18:59,822
我们走
Come on.

139
00:19:03,689 --> 00:19:06,976
跟着那女孩把机器人抢过来
Follow the girl and get that droid.

140
00:19:09,969 --> 00:19:11,988
Ren要见囚犯.

141
00:19:20,643 --> 00:19:22,063
进去.
Turn here.

142
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,016
仔细听好了.
Listen carefully.

143
00:19:25,041 --> 00:19:27,310
如果你按我说的做，我就可以带你离开这儿
If you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here.

144
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:28,735
什么？
What?

145
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,750
我正在救你，帮你逃出这鬼地方.
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

146
00:19:31,775 --> 00:19:33,476
你会开钛战机吗?
Can you fly a TIE fighter?
[TIE fighter:双离子引擎（Twin Ion Engines）战机，约定俗成为钛战机]
[帝国主力战机，没有超空间驱动器，一般不会在深空作战]

147
00:19:33,501 --> 00:19:34,729
你是抵抗组织的人？
You are with the Resistance?

148
00:19:34,754 --> 00:19:36,715
什么? 不 不 不.我只是带你离开这儿
What? No no no. I'm breaking you out.

149

- 你会开钛战机吗?  - 我会驾驶任何飞行器
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?  - I can fly anything.

150
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,585
为什么？你为什么要帮我?
Why? Why are you helping me?

151
00:19:43,269 --> 00:19:45,655
因为这么做是正确的.
Because it's the right thing to do.

152
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:47,270
你需要一个飞行员
You need a pilot.

153
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:48,971
我确实需要一个飞行员
I need a pilot.

154
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:51,530
那我们开搞吧
We're gonna do this.

155
00:19:51,555 --> 00:19:52,806
是吗?
Yeah?

156
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:59,188
好吧，冷静，冷静.
Okay, stay calm, stay calm.

157
00:19:59,189 --> 00:20:00,440
我很冷静
I am calm.

158
00:20:00,441 --> 00:20:02,313
我在跟自己说
I'm talking to myself.

159
00:20:04,299 --> 00:20:05,795
还没
Not yet.

160
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:09,072
走，走这边
Okay, go. This way.

161
00:20:15,052 --> 00:20:17,120
我一直想飞这种战机
I always wanted to fly one of these things.

162
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:19,132
- 你会射击吗?  - 我会用爆能枪
- Can you shoot? - Blasters, I can.

163
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,566
那就行，同样的原理
Okay, same principle.

164
00:20:20,591 --> 00:20:23,707
左侧开关是用来转换导弹、航炮和麦加脉冲的
Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons and Mag pulses.

165
00:20:23,732 --> 00:20:25,873
右边的是准星，瞄准、开火.
The sight on the right to aim, triggers to fire.

166
00:20:25,898 --> 00:20:27,857
这太复杂了
This is very complicated.

167
00:20:33,647 --> 00:20:35,371
我能搞定.
I can fix this.

168
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:40,651
2号停泊口有架战机未经许可便要离开.
We have an unsanctioned departure from Bay 2.

169
00:20:40,676 --> 00:20:44,125
向赫斯将军报告，并阻止那架战机
Alert General Hux, and stop that fighter.

170
00:21:03,988 --> 00:21:05,615
炸掉指挥塔
Blow up the command.

171
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:08,655
我知道
I got it.

172
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:14,541
这才是真的动起来了
This thing really moves.

173
00:21:18,466 --> 00:21:20,670
如果我们要跑得很远的话
Alright, we got to take out as many of these cannons as we can

174
00:21:20,695 --> 00:21:22,205
- 就要尽量避开那些火炮    - 好的
- if we're gonna get very far.  - Alright.

175
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:25,347
我马上要就位了，保持警惕
I'm going to get us in position. Just stay sharp.

176
00:21:27,323 --> 00:21:29,455
前方！前方！ 你看到了吗？
Up ahead! Up ahead! Do you see it?

177
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,203
我要从中间穿过去，你要把炮台清理干净
I got us dead centered. It's a clean shot.

178
00:21:31,228 --> 00:21:32,673
我知道了
I got it.

179
00:21:40,638 --> 00:21:42,021
- 耶！   - 太棒了！
- Yeah!  - Yes!

180
00:21:42,046 --> 00:21:43,502
看到没？看到没？
Did you see that? Did you see that?

181
00:21:43,527 --> 00:21:45,218
看到了！
I saw it!

183
00:21:52,726 --> 00:21:54,150
F什么？
F... what?

184
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:56,024
这是他们给我的唯一名字
That's the only name they ever gave me.

185
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,813
好吧，我肯定不会用这名. FN，是吧?
Well, I ain't using it. FN, huh?

186
00:21:58,838 --> 00:22:01,016
Finn. 我叫你Finn，可以吗？
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn. Is it alright?

187
00:22:01,017 --> 00:22:03,355
Finn，好，Finn，我喜欢这名！
Finn. Yeah! Finn, I like that!

188
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:04,456
这个名字我喜欢.
I like that.

189
00:22:04,457 --> 00:22:05,771
我叫Poe, Poe Dameron.
I'm Poe, Poe Dameron.

190
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:08,470
- 很高兴认识你,Poe.   - 我也很高兴认识你，Finn！
- Good to meet you, Poe. - Good to meet you too, Finn!

191
00:22:10,971 --> 00:22:14,188
长官，他们已经离开涡轮激光炮的射程了.
Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers.
[turbolaser：涡轮激光炮，一种配备有大型电容组的重型激光炮，能贮存和产生远比一般炮台更强]
[的能量爆发.主要用于可旋转炮塔，一般装备于太空战舰边缘.有些不能移动的改装版用于地面战斗]

192
00:22:14,605 --> 00:22:16,289
换腹炮
Use the ventral cannons.

193
00:22:16,314 --> 00:22:18,153
是，长官.正切换到腹炮
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

194
00:22:18,178 --> 00:22:21,100
Hux将军，是那个抵抗组织的飞行员吗?
General Hux, is it the Resistance pilot?

195
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:25,423
是，还有个我们的人在帮他.
Yes, and he had helped from one of our own.

196
00:22:25,582 --> 00:22:28,940
我们正在核查注册表确定他的身份.
We are checking the registers now to identify which Stormtrooper it was.

197
00:22:28,965 --> 00:22:32,783
是在村庄的那个FN-2187.
The one from the Village. FN-2187.

198
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:35,538
长官，腹炮准备就绪.
Sir, ventral cannons on.

199
00:22:35,847 --> 00:22:37,293
开火.
Fire.

200
00:22:45,598 --> 00:22:48,143
什么东西朝你来了，在我的右边你的左边，看到了吗？
What's coming towards you? My right. Your left. Do you see it?

201
00:22:48,144 --> 00:22:50,834
等下，我看到了！
Hold on. I see them!

202
00:22:53,684 --> 00:22:55,298
射得不错！
Nice shot!

203
00:23:01,429 --> 00:23:02,529
我们要去哪儿？
Where're we going?

204
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,978
我们要回Jakku星.
We're going back to Jakku, that's where.

205
00:23:03,979 --> 00:23:05,619
不，不，不，我们不能回Jakku.
No, no, no. We can't go back to Jakku.

206
00:23:05,644 --> 00:23:06,847
我们得离开这个星系.
We need to get out of this system.

207
00:23:06,872 --> 00:23:09,016
我必须抢在“第一秩序”之前找到我的机器人
I got to get my droid before the First Order does.

208
00:23:09,017 --> 00:23:10,377
- 什么?  一个机器人?  - 没错
- What? A droid?  - That's right.

209
00:23:10,402 --> 00:23:12,449
橙白相间的BB型机器人.
The BB unit, orange and white. One of a kind.

210
00:23:12,488 --> 00:23:14,821
我才不管它是什么颜色！什么机器人都不重要！
I don't care what color he is! No droid can be that important!

211
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:15,964
哥们，这个可是很重要.
This one is, man.

212
00:23:15,989 --> 00:23:17,735
我们必需尽可能的远离“第一秩序”.
We need to get as far away from the First Order as we can.

213
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:19,455
回到Jakku我们就挂了.
We go back to Jakku, we die.

214
00:23:19,456 --> 00:23:22,124
这机器人有能找到天行者Luke的地图.
The droid has a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

215
00:23:22,149 --> 00:23:24,519
噢，开什么玩笑！
Oh, you got to be kidding me!

216
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:32,870
FN-2187回来后，已完成了对他的评估并准备将其送去修复.
FN-2187 reported to my division, was evaluated and sent to reconditioning.

217
00:23:32,895 --> 00:23:35,045
之前没有任何反常？
No prior signs of nonconformity?

218
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,994
这是他第一次出错.
This was his first offense.

219
00:23:37,019 --> 00:23:39,143
将军，他们被击中了.
General. They've been hit.

220
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:41,120
- 全死了吗?  - 失去反抗能力了
- Destroyed?  - Disabled.

221
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:42,640
他们坠落在了Jakku星
They've headed back to Jakku.

222
00:23:42,665 --> 00:23:44,911
图像传感器显示坠落地点位于Goazon荒原
The CIS projected the crash in the Goazon Badlands.

223
00:23:44,936 --> 00:23:46,842
他们打算回去找机器人
They were going back for the droid.

224
00:23:46,867 --> 00:23:49,056
派个小组去坠毁点
Send a squad to the wreckage.

225
00:24:11,087 --> 00:24:12,635
Poe!
Poe!

226
00:24:13,717 --> 00:24:15,086
Poe!
Poe!

227
00:24:15,668 --> 00:24:17,016
Poe!
Poe!

228
00:24:20,207 --> 00:24:22,019
Poe! 我抓到你了.
Poe! I got you.

229
00:24:23,726 --> 00:24:25,171
Poe!
Poe!

230
00:24:31,685 --> 00:24:32,985
Poe!
Poe!

231
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,707
最高统帅Snoke明确表示
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.
[Supreme Leader Snoke:第一秩序的最高领袖Snoke，原力黑暗面非常强大]

232
00:26:00,732 --> 00:26:01,850
必须摧毁机器人，能否取回是次要的.
Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it, we must.

233
00:26:01,875 --> 00:26:03,529
将军，你的人能力怎么样？
How capable are your soldiers, General?

234
00:26:03,554 --> 00:26:05,275
不要质疑我的人.
I won't have you question my methods.

235
00:26:05,276 --> 00:26:07,339
显然他们很容易叛变.
They are obviously skilled at committing high treason.

236
00:26:07,364 --> 00:26:09,861
也许Snoke领袖应该考虑下使用克隆人军队.
Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.

237
00:26:09,886 --> 00:26:12,677
我的人从一出生就接受了编程，接受了特别训练
My men are exceptionally trained. Programmed from birth.

238
00:26:12,702 --> 00:26:15,287
那么完好无缺的取回个机器人
Then, they should have no problem retrieving the droid,

239
00:26:15,312 --> 00:26:16,748
应该完全没问题吧
unharmed.

240
00:26:17,046 --> 00:26:22,021
小心点, Ren，不要让你的个人兴趣妨碍到Snoke领袖的命令
Careful, Ren, that your personal interest not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.

241
00:26:22,046 --> 00:26:24,319
我要那个地图
I want that map.

242
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:27,989
为了你着想，我建议你去搞到它.
For your sake, I suggest you get it.

243
00:26:34,117 --> 00:26:35,851
水，水.
Water. Water.

244
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,772
- 水     - 不
- Water.  - No.

245
00:26:39,699 --> 00:26:41,302
有没有水？
There's no water?

246
00:27:06,493 --> 00:27:08,432
小妞，这机器人我要了.
Girl, your droid. I want it.

247
00:27:08,457 --> 00:27:09,854
- 啊？  - 什么？
- Huh?  - What?

248
00:27:09,879 --> 00:27:11,827
喂！离它远点！
Oi! Get away from him!

249
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,570
嘿！
Hey!

250
00:27:30,674 --> 00:27:31,869
哈？
Huh?

251
00:27:35,981 --> 00:27:38,333
这些是什么人？
Who are those people.

252
00:27:38,358 --> 00:27:39,982
他们是Unkar的狗腿子.
They work for Unkar.
[Unkar:Jakku星废品商，雇佣了一群暴徒协助他经营废品生意]

253
00:27:44,895 --> 00:27:46,935
小姐！那个人！
Mistress! That man!

254
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,260
谁？
Who?

255
00:27:48,962 --> 00:27:49,826
那边那个男的
That man over there.

256
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:50,997
- 他？  - 没错
- Him?  - Yes.

257
00:27:51,022 --> 00:27:53,147
他穿着我主人的夹克.
He is wearing my master's jacket.

258
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,447
着什么急呢，贼娃子？
What is your hurry, thief?

259
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,690
啥？贼娃子？
What? Thief?

260
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:15,534
噢！嘿！搞啥啊？
Oww! Hey! What?

261
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:18,574
这个机器人说这夹克是你偷来的
The jacket. This droid says you stole it.

262
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:20,475
我今天已经很糟糕了，好吗？
I had a pretty messed up day, alright?

263
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:22,852
所以我会很感激如果你停止指控我...
So I'd appreciate it if you'd stop accusing me...

264
00:28:22,853 --> 00:28:25,178
- 啊！住手！   - 你从哪儿弄的夹克？
- Ow! Stop it!  - Where did you get it?

265
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:27,196
这件夹克是属于他主人的
It belongs to his master.

266
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:34,086
这件外套是Poe Dameron的，对不？
It belongs to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right?

267
00:28:35,511 --> 00:28:38,188
他被“第一秩序”抓了.
He was captured by the First Order.

268
00:28:38,213 --> 00:28:41,204
我帮他逃了出来，我们的飞船坠毁了.
I helped him escape, our ship crashed.

269
00:28:43,835 --> 00:28:45,577
Poe牺牲了.
Poe didn't make it.

270
00:28:46,132 --> 00:28:47,583
呜~
Ohhh.

271
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:52,378
我试着帮他但是非常抱歉.
I tried to help him but I'm sorry.

272
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:02,036
所以你是抵抗组织的人？
So you're with the Resistance?

273
00:29:06,404 --> 00:29:07,831
显然
Obviously.

274
00:29:07,856 --> 00:29:09,425
我是.
Yes, I am

275
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:12,936
我是抵抗组织的人，没错，我是抵抗组织的人
I'm with the Resistance, yeah. I'm with the Resistance.

276
00:29:13,969 --> 00:29:16,811
我还从没见过抵抗组织的战士
I never met a Resistance fighter before.

277
00:29:17,967 --> 00:29:20,562
我们就是这样.至少有些人是.
I was... that's what we look like. Some of us.

278
00:29:20,587 --> 00:29:22,153
另一些人则不同
Others look different.

279
00:29:22,178 --> 00:29:25,197
BB-8说他正在执行一个秘密任务，他必须回你们基地.
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission. He has to get back to your base.

280
00:29:25,198 --> 00:29:27,519
他似乎有张能找到天行者Luke的地图.
Apparently he has a map that leads to Luke Skywalker.

281
00:29:27,544 --> 00:29:29,629
每个人都在找这玩意儿.
And everyone is after it.

282
00:29:29,775 --> 00:29:31,717
天行者Luke？
Luke Skywalker?

283
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:33,883
我以为他只是个传说
I thought he was a myth.

284
00:29:34,535 --> 00:29:35,786
什么？
What?

285
00:29:43,923 --> 00:29:46,174
- 你要干嘛？  - 快走.
- What are you doing?  - Come on.

286
00:29:46,558 --> 00:29:48,143
快来，BB-8！
Come on, BB-8!

287
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,854
-  放开我！    - 我们必须跑了！
- Let go of me!  - Come on! We got to move!

288
00:29:52,879 --> 00:29:55,762
没你牵着手我也知道该怎么跑.
I know how to run without you holding my hand.

289
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,278
BB-8，跟上！
BB-8, stay close!

290
00:29:59,303 --> 00:30:00,851
这边.
This way.

291
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:08,124
呼叫空中打击.
Call in the air strike.

292
00:30:11,024 --> 00:30:12,397
他们在向我们俩开枪.
They're shooting at both of us.

293
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:14,543
是的，他们看见你和我在一起了，你被标记了.
Yeah, they saw you with me. You are marked.

294
00:30:14,568 --> 00:30:15,718
噢，真要谢谢你.
Well, thanks for that.

295
00:30:15,743 --> 00:30:18,648
嘿!我又没用棍子打你.
Hey! I'm not the one to take you down with a stick.

296
00:30:18,898 --> 00:30:20,580
这儿没人有枪吗？
Does anyone have blasters around here?

297
00:30:20,605 --> 00:30:22,165
你还好吧？
Are you okay?

298
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:24,030
嘘.嘘.嘘.
Shh. Shh. Shhh.

299
00:30:27,818 --> 00:30:30,401
不要抓我的手！
Stop taking my hand!

300
00:30:45,728 --> 00:30:47,028
嘿.
Hey.

301
00:30:50,058 --> 00:30:51,688
你没事吧？
Are you okay?

302
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,302
没事.
Yeah.

303
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:55,755
跟着我
Follow me.

304
00:31:06,417 --> 00:31:07,665
我们跑不脱了！
We can't outrun them!

305
00:31:07,690 --> 00:31:09,794
那可不一定. 去那架Quad-Jumper！
We might. In that Quad-Jumper!

306
00:31:09,819 --> 00:31:11,527
嘿！我们需要一个飞行员！
Hey! We need a pilot!

307
00:31:11,552 --> 00:31:12,925
我们有一个.
We got one.

308
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,250
你？
You?

309
00:31:15,068 --> 00:31:16,735
那艘船怎么样？
What about that ship?

310
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,810
那是个垃圾！
That one's GARBAGE!

311
00:31:23,443 --> 00:31:25,497
那个垃圾也可以.
The garbage will do.

312
00:31:41,078 --> 00:31:43,233
炮位在下面！
Gunner position is down there!

313
00:31:45,933 --> 00:31:47,751
你飞过这玩意吗？
You ever fly this thing?

314
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:50,874
没！这船很多年都没飞过了.
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

315
00:31:50,899 --> 00:31:52,244
真好.
Great.

316
00:31:57,978 --> 00:31:59,997
我能搞定. 我能搞定.
I can do this. I can do this.

317
00:32:00,022 --> 00:32:02,838
我能搞定. 我能搞定.
I can do this. I can do this.

318
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:24,271
嘿!
Hey!

319
00:32:28,122 --> 00:32:30,622
那是我的!
That's mine!

320
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:35,023
等下！低飞！低飞！
Hold! Stay low! Stay low!

321
00:32:35,048 --> 00:32:36,048
啥？
What?

322
00:32:36,073 --> 00:32:37,752
低空飞行能扰乱他们的追踪！
Stay low! It confuses their tracking.

323
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:39,883
- BB-8，坐稳了.  - 为咩啊？
- BB-8, hold on.  - Whyee?

324
00:32:39,884 --> 00:32:41,659
我要低空飞行了！
I'm going low!

325
00:32:59,558 --> 00:33:01,046
你在后面干嘛？
What are you doing back there?

326
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:02,404
不打算还击吗？
Are you ever going to fire back?

327
00:33:02,429 --> 00:33:04,455
我正在弄! 防护盾升起来没？
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

328
00:33:04,480 --> 00:33:06,452
没有副驾驶哪能那么容易？
Not so easy without a co-pilot.

329
00:33:06,477 --> 00:33:08,565
那你来试试我这个仨.
Try sitting in this thing.

330
00:33:22,682 --> 00:33:25,589
- 我们需要掩护，快点.  - 马上就有了！
- We need cover, quick. - We're about to get some!

331
00:33:25,614 --> 00:33:27,014
希望吧.
I hope.

332
00:33:42,195 --> 00:33:43,449
哇.
Whoa.

333
00:33:52,814 --> 00:33:54,140
卧槽.
Damn it.

334
00:34:05,059 --> 00:34:07,013
来呀，来呀！
Come on, come on!

335
00:34:09,568 --> 00:34:10,682
打得好！
Nice shot!

336
00:34:10,707 --> 00:34:12,361
玩这个我会很牛逼的.
I'm getting pretty good at this.

337
00:34:14,948 --> 00:34:16,861
快来拆了它！
Let's get down!

338
00:34:25,846 --> 00:34:27,941
呃，火炮卡在了正向位置，无法移动.
Alright. The cannon's stuck in forward position. I can't move it.

339
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:29,669
你得甩脱他们.
You got to lose them.

340
00:34:33,008 --> 00:34:34,114
准备好！
Get ready!

341
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:36,353
好的，准备好什么？
Okay. For what?

342
00:34:49,245 --> 00:34:51,209
真要这么搞吗？
Are we really doing this?

343
00:34:59,683 --> 00:35:01,052
哦，别.
Oh, no.

344
00:35:22,947 --> 00:35:24,353
哇喔！
Whoa!

345
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,299
- 那才叫飞行.  - 打得好.
- That was some flying. - Nice shooting.

346
00:35:39,324 --> 00:35:40,610
- 谢谢.    - 你是怎么做到的？
- Thanks.  - How did you do that?

347
00:35:40,635 --> 00:35:42,163
- 我不知道.    - 没人教过你？
- I don't know. - No one trained you?

348
00:35:42,188 --> 00:35:43,493
我都从来没有离开过这个星球.
But I've never left the planet.

349
00:35:43,518 --> 00:35:44,986
- 你最后一枪打得太棒了.   - 真是太神奇了.
- Your last shot was great. - That was amazing.

350
00:35:44,987 --> 00:35:46,654
你可是给我挖了个坑
You set me up for it.

351
00:35:46,679 --> 00:35:48,700
- 多完美的坑啊.     - 相当不错.
- It was perfect.  - That was pretty good.

352
00:35:51,337 --> 00:35:53,902
没事儿的，他是抵抗力量的人.
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

353
00:35:53,927 --> 00:35:54,852
嗯.
Hmm.

354
00:35:54,877 --> 00:35:56,703
他会把你送回去的
He's going to get you home.

355
00:35:57,744 --> 00:35:59,304
我也会.
We both will.

356
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,158
我还不知道你叫什么.
I don't know your name.

357
00:36:07,422 --> 00:36:09,873
Finn. 你怎么称呼？
Finn. What's yours?

358
00:36:10,283 --> 00:36:11,835
我叫Rey.
I'm Rey.

359
00:36:16,197 --> 00:36:17,497
Rey...
Rey...

360
00:36:18,181 --> 00:36:20,546
赶紧过来帮我！
Help me with this. Quick!

361
00:36:20,571 --> 00:36:22,862
又怎么了？
What-What's going on?

362
00:36:32,925 --> 00:36:37,290
长官，我们没抓到那个机器人.
Sir, we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku.

363
00:36:39,391 --> 00:36:44,012
它搭乘偷来的柯尔里亚YT型货船逃掉了.
He escaped capture on a stolen Corellian YT model freighter.
[Corellian YT model freighter:柯尔里亚YT型货船，此处特指千年隼号]
[千年隼号本为柯尔里亚集团制造的YT-1300型货船，后经汉・索洛大幅改装]

364
00:36:44,682 --> 00:36:48,428
那个机器人偷了一艘货船?
The droid... stole a freighter?

365
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:50,228
不完全是，长官
Not exactly, sir.

366
00:36:50,943 --> 00:36:52,691
它有帮手.
It had help.

367
00:36:55,232 --> 00:36:56,511
我们还没有确认，
We have no confirmation,

368
00:36:56,512 --> 00:37:00,241
但我们相信FN-2187可能在帮他
but we believe FN-2187 may have helped him escape.

369
00:37:17,306 --> 00:37:19,293
还有别的吗？
Anything else?

370
00:37:21,151 --> 00:37:23,696
同行的两人中还有个是女生.
The two were accompanied by a girl.

371
00:37:28,127 --> 00:37:30,058
什么女生？
What girl?

372
00:37:32,395 --> 00:37:33,578
动力系统出了问题.
It's the motivator.

373
00:37:33,603 --> 00:37:35,268
拿个哈里斯扳手给我.就在那边.
Grab me a Harris wrench. Check in there.

374
00:37:35,293 --> 00:37:37,812
- 有多糟糕？    - 我们可能会挂.
- How bad is it?  - If we want to live, not good.

375
00:37:37,837 --> 00:37:40,483
他们正在找我们，我们得赶紧离开这个星系！
They're hunting for us now. We got to get out of this system!

376
00:37:40,484 --> 00:37:42,934
BB-8 说抵抗组织的基地方位是机密.
BB-8 says the location of the Resistance base is 'need to know.'

377
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:44,945
如果要我带你去那儿，我需要知道具体的位置.
If I'm taking you there, I need to know.

378
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:46,332
这个吗？
This?

379
00:37:47,504 --> 00:37:48,873
你得告诉我们基地的位置.
You got to tell us where your base is.

380
00:37:48,898 --> 00:37:50,025
什么？不.
What? No.

381
00:37:50,050 --> 00:37:51,593
我不知道啊.
I don't speak that.

382
00:37:51,618 --> 00:37:55,579
好吧，这事儿只有我俩知道，我不是抵抗组织的人，行了吧？
Okay, between us, I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

383
00:37:55,580 --> 00:37:57,548
我只是想远离“第一秩序”.
I'm just trying to get away from the First Order.

384
00:37:57,573 --> 00:37:59,192
但如果你告诉我们基地的位置
But if you tell us where the base is,

385
00:37:59,217 --> 00:38:01,667
我就先把你送到那儿，成不？
I'll get you there first. Deal?

386
00:38:01,692 --> 00:38:02,799
拜托了，机器人！
Droid, please!

387
00:38:02,824 --> 00:38:04,358
Pilex起子，赶紧.
Pilex driver, hurry.

388
00:38:04,383 --> 00:38:06,435
- 嗯，你们基地在哪？  - BB-8告诉她.
- So,where is your base?  - Go on, BB-8, tell her .

389
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,755
咦？呃
Huh? Eh.

390
00:38:07,803 --> 00:38:09,476
咦？呃
Huh? Eh.

391
00:38:09,501 --> 00:38:10,422
咦？
Huh?

392
00:38:10,447 --> 00:38:11,985
拜托.
Please.

393
00:38:13,074 --> 00:38:15,338
- Ileenium星系!   - 是的，Ileenium星系.
- The  Ileenium System!  - Yes, the Ileenium System.

394
00:38:15,339 --> 00:38:17,391
尽快把我们带到那儿.
That's the one. Get us there as fast as you can.

395
00:38:18,973 --> 00:38:20,371
我需要发动机胶带，赶紧.
I need the engine tape, hurry.

396
00:38:20,396 --> 00:38:22,442
- 那你呢？   - 我要回Jakku.
- What about you?  - I got to get back to Jakku.

397
00:38:22,467 --> 00:38:25,123
回Jakku...为什么每个人都想回Jakku？
Back to Jakk... Why does everyone want to go back to Jakku?

398
00:38:25,148 --> 00:38:26,289
- 不是那个.    - 那地方...
- It's not that one. - That place is...

399
00:38:26,314 --> 00:38:27,798
不是，不是
No. No.

400
00:38:27,823 --> 00:38:29,176
我指的那个.
The one I'm pointing to.

401
00:38:29,201 --> 00:38:31,431
不是，不是，不是！
No. No. No!

402
00:38:31,432 --> 00:38:33,425
如果我们不修好推进系统，燃料箱就会泄露.
If we don't patches up the propulsion, the tank will overflow

403
00:38:33,450 --> 00:38:35,704
这船里就会全是毒气.
and fill up this ship with poisonous gas.

404
00:38:35,729 --> 00:38:37,496
- 这个？  - 是的
- This?  - Yes.

405
00:38:37,878 --> 00:38:40,840
嘿，Rey，你是飞行员.
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

406
00:38:40,865 --> 00:38:42,961
你能去任何地方，为什么要回去？
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

407
00:38:42,986 --> 00:38:44,293
你有家人？
You got a family?

408
00:38:44,318 --> 00:38:45,662
你有男朋友？一个可爱的男朋友？
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

409
00:38:45,687 --> 00:38:47,610
不关你的事，这就是原因
None of your business, that's why.

410

- That can't be good.  - To the cockpit.

有人把我们锁定了并篡改了控制权.

412
00:39:05,993 --> 00:39:08,172
拿开.拿开！

413
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:11,726
看见什么了？
Do you see anything?

414
00:39:12,231 --> 00:39:13,704

是第一秩序.

00:39:26,942 --> 00:39:28,596
能再放出来吗？

419
00:39:33,849 --> 00:39:35,492
快点，BB-8

Yeah, their masks filter out smoke not toxins.

424
00:39:57,589 --> 00:39:59,387
快点，他们来了.

425
00:40:10,418 --> 00:40:14,593
Chewie，我们回家了.

你能听懂那玩意儿说什么？
You can understand that thing?

431
00:40:37,855 --> 00:40:40,101
“那玩意儿”也听得懂你说什么，小心点.

432
00:40:40,126 --> 00:40:41,688
出来.

谢谢你！垃圾场.

她在谁手上？Ducain?

438
00:40:52,813 --> 00:40:55,141
我从Unkar Plutt那儿偷来的
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain.

他的千年隼号.

443
00:41:03,863 --> 00:41:07,383
这是“千年隼号”？ 你是Han Solo ？
This is the "Millennium Falcon"? You are Han Solo?

444
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:10,025

Han Solo，反抗军将军？

446
00:41:12,181 --> 00:41:13,527
不是，是走私犯.
No, the smuggler.

447
00:41:13,552 --> 00:41:15,318
他不是一个战争英雄吗？
Wasn't he a war hero?

448
00:41:15,416 --> 00:41:18,780
这是一艘能以14秒差距离完成Kessel Run线路的飞船.
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs.
[Kessel Run：星际间的一条走私路线；parsecs：秒差距，天体间距离单位]

12秒差距！  12!
[《新希望》中，Han曾向Obi-Wan和Luke炫耀千年隼号能在12秒差距之内跑完Kessel Run]

450
00:41:21,332 --> 00:41:23,078
鬼的14.  14.

451
00:41:38,001 --> 00:41:39,380
嘿！ Hey!

453
00:41:42,698 --> 00:41:43,819
Unkar Plutt干的

454
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,336
我也觉得这样搞是错的，这将导致

457
00:41:50,209 --> 00:41:52,697

这个机器人得尽快赶到抵抗组织基地去
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible.

461
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:02,970
它有能找到天行者Luke的地图

462
00:42:06,965 --> 00:42:10,272
你是和反抗军并肩战斗过的Han Solo.

00:42:28,302 --> 00:42:31,155
别告诉我"Rathtar"跑出来了
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.
[Rathtar：此怪兽目前无中文名，详情请参见http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Rathtar]

467
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:32,774

468
00:42:32,888 --> 00:42:34,953
你刚说"Rathtar"？

469
00:42:35,391 --> 00:42:36,426
嘿！

你该不会把“Rathtar”搬上货船了吧？
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?

471
00:42:39,412 --> 00:42:41,373
我抓了几只"Rathtar"

00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:45,020
哦，这下好了，瓜维亚死亡帮.
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.
[Guavian Death Gang：瓜维亚死亡帮，星际黑帮组织]

473
00:42:45,045 --> 00:42:46,835
他们肯定是从Nantoon一路跟踪过来的.
They must've tracked us from Nantoon.

474
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,237
"Rathtar"是什么？

475
00:42:48,262 --> 00:42:49,917
又大又危险的家伙.

听说过Trillia大屠杀吗？

Three? How did you get them on board?

480
00:42:57,219 --> 00:42:59,667
那时我们有更多的船员.

481
00:43:02,729 --> 00:43:04,588
到下面去躲着直到我说出来.
Get below and stay there until I say so.

482
00:43:04,613 --> 00:43:06,312
不要想夺走千年隼号.

483
00:43:06,337 --> 00:43:07,457
BB-8怎么办?

到时候你再要回去带走.
then you can have him back and be on your way.

486
00:43:10,606 --> 00:43:12,923

What about the Rathtars? Where're you keeping them?

487

你准备怎么办？
What are you going to do?

00:43:17,307 --> 00:43:19,468
做我一贯做的，用我的方式找到出路
Same thing I always do Talk my way out of it.

490
00:43:19,493 --> 00:43:20,669

00:43:20,694 --> 00:43:23,383
是的，每次都是.
Yes, I do. Every time.

492
00:43:40,098 --> 00:43:43,884
Han Solo,你这个死人.

493
00:43:43,909 --> 00:43:46,770
Bala-Tik, 有什么问题吗？
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

00:43:46,795 --> 00:43:49,672
问题是为这份工作我们贷给你了50,000.
The problem is that we loaned you 50,000 for this job.

495
00:43:49,673 --> 00:43:50,835

Can you see them?

496
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:52,236
看不到
No.

我听说你从坎吉俱乐部帮那儿也借了50,000
I heard you also borrowed 50,000 from Kanjiklub.
[Kanjiklub:坎吉俱乐部帮,星际黑帮,老大Tasu Leech（塔苏・利奇)]

498

要知道你不能相信那些变态.
You know you can't trust those little freaks.

499
00:43:58,298 --> 00:44:00,611
我们彼此认识多久了？

Not long. We want our money back now.

502
00:44:06,491 --> 00:44:09,648
你觉得抓这些"Rathtar"很便宜？钱我都花光了.
You think hunting Rathtars is cheap? I spent that money.

503
00:44:09,673 --> 00:44:12,208
坎吉俱乐部帮也想收回他们投资.
Kanjiklub wants their investment back too.

504
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:14,447
我可从没跟坎吉俱乐部帮做过交易.
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

505
00:44:14,472 --> 00:44:16,797
去跟坎吉俱乐部帮说吧.

是的

从这儿能关上门？
Close the blast doors from here?

524
00:45:25,241 --> 00:45:27,483
重置下保险丝就可以
Resetting the fuses should do it.

525
00:45:35,216 --> 00:45:36,972
我有种不祥的预感

[星战系列的金句，无论前传、正传，每集中至少要出现一次]

00:47:02,513 --> 00:47:04,295
放开我！
Get it off me!

544
00:47:21,892 --> 00:47:23,766
滚开！滚开！
Get off! Get off!

545
00:47:25,633 --> 00:47:26,890
Finn！
Finn!

546
00:47:27,707 --> 00:47:29,064
它抓住了我！但那门...
It had me! But the door...

547
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:30,685
真走运.
That was lucky.

548
00:47:34,037 --> 00:47:36,110
我来开门，掩护我们！
I got the door. Cover us!

549
00:47:43,152 --> 00:47:44,097
啊~~
AAWWW!

550
00:47:44,122 --> 00:47:45,422
Chewie!
Chewie!

551
00:47:47,953 --> 00:47:49,374
没事吧？
Are you okay?

552
00:47:49,399 --> 00:47:50,571
嗯.
Yeah.

553
00:47:50,876 --> 00:47:52,270
哇
Wow.

554
00:47:53,978 --> 00:47:55,637
快点儿！快点儿！
Come on! Come on!

555
00:47:59,892 --> 00:48:01,882
- Han   - 你，把身后的门关上.
- Han   - You, close the door behind us.

556
00:48:01,907 --> 00:48:03,803
你，照顾Chewie!
You, take care of Chewie!

557
00:48:03,828 --> 00:48:05,287
啊~~
Awww!

558
00:48:11,017 --> 00:48:12,378
嘿，你要干嘛？
Hey. Where're you going?

559
00:48:12,403 --> 00:48:14,024
Unkar Plutt在这儿装了个燃料泵.
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump here.

560
00:48:14,049 --> 00:48:15,925
如果不装填好，我们就哪儿都去不了...
If we don't prime that, we're not going anywhere..

561
00:48:15,950 --> 00:48:17,087
我讨厌那货.
I hate that guy.

562
00:48:17,112 --> 00:48:20,589
- 你还需要一个副驾驶   - 原来有个，现在在那儿.
- And you could use a co-pilot. - I got one, he's back there.

563
00:48:21,986 --> 00:48:24,295
看着推进器，我们要用光速离开这儿
Watch the thrusters. We're getting out of here in light speed.

564
00:48:24,296 --> 00:48:26,166
从吊舱内部？这可能吗？
From inside of a hanger? Is that even possible?

565
00:48:26,191 --> 00:48:29,309
我都是做完之后才问这个问题.
I never ask that question until after I've done it.

566
00:48:30,637 --> 00:48:32,899
这可不是我想象中的那一天
This is not how I thought this day was going to go.

567
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,045
打开防护盾，后面的坐稳了！
Angle the shield. Hang on back there!

568
00:48:35,077 --> 00:48:36,693
没问题！
No problem!

569
00:48:46,128 --> 00:48:48,314
快点，宝贝，别让我失望.
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

570
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:52,012
- 什么？  - 压缩器.
- What?   - Compressor.

571
00:49:00,341 --> 00:49:03,600
通知第一秩序，他们要的机器人在Han Solo手里.
Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they wanted.

572
00:49:03,625 --> 00:49:06,240
在千年隼号上.
And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.

573
00:49:14,397 --> 00:49:19,608
那个机器人很快就会送到抵抗力量那儿
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance,

574
00:49:20,049 --> 00:49:24,152
带他们去找最后一个绝地武士
leading them to the last Jedi.

575
00:49:24,948 --> 00:49:29,087
如果天行者回归了
If Skywalker returns,

576
00:49:29,112 --> 00:49:33,730
新的绝地武士就会崛起
the new Jedi will rise.

577
00:49:34,062 --> 00:49:36,131
最高领袖，我承担全部责任...
Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility....

578
00:49:36,156 --> 00:49:38,551
将军！
General!

579
00:49:39,757 --> 00:49:42,960
我们必须改变策略了.
Our strategy must now change.

580
00:49:42,985 --> 00:49:45,200
终极武器已经准备就绪.
The weapon. It is ready.

581
00:49:45,225 --> 00:49:47,395
我认为是时候使用它了
I believe the time has come to use it.

582
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,422
我们将摧毁支持抵抗力量的政府机构
We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance.

583
00:49:50,447 --> 00:49:51,889
共和国
The Republic.

584
00:49:51,914 --> 00:49:55,301
失去了朋友的保护，抵抗力量就会变得极为脆弱.
Without their friends to protect them, the Resistance will be vulnerable.

585
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:58,355
我们就能在他们找到天行者之前阻止他们.
And we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.

586
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,134
去吧，
Go,

587
00:50:00,457 --> 00:50:02,129
去做准备工作.
oversee preparations.

588
00:50:02,154 --> 00:50:04,532
是，最高领袖.
Yes, Supreme Leader.

589
00:50:09,381 --> 00:50:12,171
有个觉醒的人已经出现了.
There has been an awakening.

590
00:50:12,641 --> 00:50:14,697
你感觉到了吗？
Have you felt it?

591
00:50:16,035 --> 00:50:17,531
是的
Yes.

592
00:50:18,505 --> 00:50:20,743
还有更多的东西
There's something more.

593
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:26,582
我们要找的机器人在千年隼号上.
The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon.

594
00:50:26,607 --> 00:50:29,873
在你父亲手上，
In the hands of your father,

595
00:50:29,898 --> 00:50:34,069
Han Solo.
Han Solo.

596
00:50:36,018 --> 00:50:38,121
他对我来说没有任何意义.
He means nothing to me.

597
00:50:38,146 --> 00:50:43,874
即使你，伦武士团的大师，
Even you, Master of the Knights of Ren,
[Knights of Ren:Kylo Ren属于伦武士团，他只是达斯・维德的崇拜者，不是西斯]

598
00:50:43,899 --> 00:50:47,502
也从未面临过如此考验.
have never faced such a test.

599
00:50:47,828 --> 00:50:51,701
承蒙您的培养，我不会受此诱惑.
By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.

600
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:54,263
到时候看吧.
We shall see.

601
00:50:56,736 --> 00:50:59,473
到时候看吧.
We shall see.

602
00:51:06,569 --> 00:51:09,357
- 超负荷了.  - 我能修好.
- Electrical overload. - I can fix that.

603
00:51:09,382 --> 00:51:11,228
冷却液泄漏了.
Coolant's leaking.

604
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:13,251
试下把辅助电源转移到...
Try transferring auxiliary power to...

605
00:51:13,276 --> 00:51:14,443
- 第二燃料箱     - 第二燃料箱
- secondary tank.  - Secondary tank.

606
00:51:14,468 --> 00:51:15,854
知道了.
I got it.

607
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:18,338
Chewie, 别这样！
Chewie, come on!

608
00:51:19,390 --> 00:51:21,259
这边的大毛熊需要帮忙！
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

609
00:51:21,284 --> 00:51:23,036
- 来了    - 别乱动！
- Coming.  - Stop moving!

610
00:51:23,276 --> 00:51:24,123
啊呜！
Ahhh!

611
00:51:24,148 --> 00:51:26,053
- Chewie!  - 他需要帮忙.
- Chewie!  - He needs help.

612
00:51:26,078 --> 00:51:28,140
你要是伤害Chewie的话，我可饶不了你！
You hurt Chewie, you're going to deal with me!

613
00:51:28,165 --> 00:51:31,263
伤害他？他几乎杀了我六次！
Hurt him? He almost kill me six times!

614
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:32,665
这下好了.
Which is fine.

615
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,941
如果超光速引擎被击中，
If this hyperdrive blows,

616
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:37,097
我们会变成三个不同星系的碎片.
there's going to be pieces of us in three different systems.

617
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:41,589
你干什么了？
What did you do?

618
00:51:41,614 --> 00:51:44,129
我绕开了压缩器
I bypass the compressor.

619
00:51:46,248 --> 00:51:47,562
哈.
Huh.

620
00:51:50,090 --> 00:51:51,916
走开，球货.
Move, ball.

621
00:51:54,259 --> 00:51:58,218
别那样说，你做得很好，尽管休息.
Don't say that. You did great, just rest.

622
00:51:58,243 --> 00:52:00,164
干得不错，孩子
Good job, kid.

623
00:52:00,189 --> 00:52:01,397
谢谢.
Thanks.

624
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:02,843
不用客气.
You're welcome.
[全息棋盘游戏Dejarik，源自《星球大战IV：新希望》]

625
00:52:07,430 --> 00:52:08,969
这么说.
So.

626
00:52:08,994 --> 00:52:11,125
你们是逃犯哈？
Fugitive, huh?

627
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,603
“第一秩序”想要那个地图.
The First Order wants the map.

628
00:52:13,604 --> 00:52:15,601
Finn是抵抗组织的人
Finn is with the Resistance.

629
00:52:15,626 --> 00:52:17,639
我只是个拾荒者
I'm just a scavenger.

630
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:20,821
来看看你都有些什么.
Let's see what you got.

631
00:52:20,846 --> 00:52:23,036
- 可以吗？   - 去吧
- Should I?  - Go ahead.

632
00:52:32,947 --> 00:52:36,286
这不是完整的地图，只是其中的一部分.
This map is not complete, it's just a piece.

633
00:52:36,861 --> 00:52:40,789
自从Luke失踪后人们就一直在找他.
Ever since Luke disappeared people'd been looking for him.

634
00:52:41,004 --> 00:52:42,781
他为什么要离开？
Why did he leave?

635
00:52:43,652 --> 00:52:46,616
他培养了新一代的绝地武士.
He was training a new generation of Jedi.

636
00:52:46,641 --> 00:52:51,065
一个男孩，这个徒弟背叛了他，把所有的一切都毁了.
One boy, an apprentice, turned against him, destroyed it all.

637
00:52:52,132 --> 00:52:54,019
Luke深感自责.
Luke felt responsible.

638
00:52:54,044 --> 00:52:57,329
只好远离一切.
He just walked away from everything.

639
00:52:57,354 --> 00:52:59,012
你知道他发生了什么事？
Do you know what happened to him?

640
00:52:59,037 --> 00:53:02,182
有很多的谣言、传说.
A lot of rumors, stories.

641
00:53:03,354 --> 00:53:05,721
熟识他的人也只能猜测
People who'd knew him best

642
00:53:07,077 --> 00:53:10,431
他很可能去寻找第一座绝地圣殿了
think he went looking for the first Jedi Temple.

643
00:53:11,161 --> 00:53:12,484
真的有绝地武士吗？
The Jedi were real?

644
00:53:12,509 --> 00:53:14,830
以前我也怀疑过.
I used to wonder about that myself.

645
00:53:14,855 --> 00:53:17,718
我以为这只是一些胡说八道的东西.
I thought it was a bunch of mumbo jumbo.

646
00:53:17,989 --> 00:53:20,666
什么维系正义与邪恶的神奇力量
A magical power holding together good and evil,

647
00:53:20,691 --> 00:53:22,969
什么原力的黑暗面和光明面
the Dark side and the Light.

648
00:53:24,166 --> 00:53:26,120
但不可思议的是...
The crazy thing is...

649
00:53:29,029 --> 00:53:30,762
这是真的
It's true.

650
00:53:32,590 --> 00:53:34,923
原力，绝地武士
The Force, the Jedi.

651
00:53:37,143 --> 00:53:38,763
所有的事情
All of it.

652
00:53:41,023 --> 00:53:43,029
都是真的.
It's all true.

653
00:53:46,704 --> 00:53:48,794
不，你继续休息.
No, you rest.

654
00:53:48,884 --> 00:53:50,782
你想要我帮忙？那你得
You want my help? You're getting it.

655
00:53:50,807 --> 00:53:53,917
去见一个老朋友，她可以让你的机器人回家.
Going to see an old friend. She'll get your droid home.

656
00:53:54,179 --> 00:53:55,813
我们到了.
This is our stop.

657
00:54:12,886 --> 00:54:16,493
银河系里居然有星球有这么多的绿色.
I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy.

658
00:54:43,654 --> 00:54:45,833
嘿，Solo，我不知道我们来这儿干嘛.
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what we're walking into here.

659
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:47,565
你刚才叫我Solo？
Did you just call me Solo?

660
00:54:47,566 --> 00:54:49,315
对不起，Han Solo先生
Sorry, Han. Mr. Solo.

661
00:54:49,316 --> 00:54:52,823
你应该知道，我可是抵抗组织的大人物，
You should know, I'm a big deal in the Resistance,

662
00:54:52,824 --> 00:54:55,235
我是真正的目标
which puts a real target on my back.

663
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:59,221
这儿有什么陷阱吗？例如第一秩序的支持者？
Are there any conspirators here? Like First Order sympathizers?

664
00:54:59,222 --> 00:55:03,523
听着，“大人物” .你面临的是另一个问题
Listen, "big deal". You have another problem.

665
00:55:03,728 --> 00:55:06,514
女人总能找出真相
Women always figure out the truth.

666
00:55:07,563 --> 00:55:09,241
总是
Always.

667
00:55:14,856 --> 00:55:16,756
你可能会需要这个
You might need this.

668
00:55:17,554 --> 00:55:19,328
我想我自己能搞定
I think I can handle myself.

669
00:55:19,353 --> 00:55:22,021
我知道你能. 所以我才给你这个.
I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you.

670
00:55:22,046 --> 00:55:23,493
拿着.
Take it.

671
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:26,635
你知道如何使用吗？
You know how to use one of those?

672
00:55:26,660 --> 00:55:28,420
知道，扣动扳机就行了.
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

673
00:55:28,445 --> 00:55:30,825
实际上远远不止.
A little bit more truer than that.

674
00:55:30,850 --> 00:55:32,786
你还有很多要学的.
You got a lot to learn.

675
00:55:33,913 --> 00:55:35,579
你叫什么名字？
You got a name?

676
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:37,358
Rey.
Rey.

677
00:55:37,672 --> 00:55:39,240
Rey.
Rey.

678
00:55:42,557 --> 00:55:45,002
Rey，我一直想增加一些船员.
I've been thinking about bringing on some more crew, Rey.

679
00:55:45,003 --> 00:55:46,976
第二个队友，可以帮忙解决问题.
A second mate. Someone to help out.

680
00:55:46,977 --> 00:55:50,365
可以跟上Chewie和我的节奏，能够赏识千年隼号.
Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me, who appreciates the Falcon.

681
00:55:50,366 --> 00:55:52,179
你想给我一份工作？
Are you offering me a job?

682
00:55:52,180 --> 00:55:55,072
我可能不会对你很好，而且付的钱也不多.
I wouldn't be nice to you. I don't pay much.

683
00:55:55,097 --> 00:55:57,010
你在招募我
You're offering me a job

684
00:55:58,015 --> 00:56:00,172
我正在考虑
I'm thinking about it.

685
00:56:03,209 --> 00:56:04,684
怎么样？
Well?

686
00:56:08,758 --> 00:56:12,311
你这么做我很感激，但我必须回家.
If you are, I'd be flattered. But I have to go home.

687
00:56:12,336 --> 00:56:14,215
哪儿？Jakku？
Where? Jakku?

688
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,352
我已经离开太久了
I've already been away too long.

689
00:56:18,004 --> 00:56:21,265
Chewie, 仔细检查下飞船.
Chewie, checkout the ship as best you can.

690
00:56:24,043 --> 00:56:27,511
太可惜了，Chewie有几分喜欢你呢
It's too bad. Chewie kinda likes you.

691
00:56:30,255 --> 00:56:31,862
Solo，我们为什么来这儿？
Solo, why are we here again?

692
00:56:31,887 --> 00:56:34,430
- 为了让你的机器人能待在一个“干净”的船上  - 干净?
- To get your droid on a clean ship.   - Clean?

693
00:56:34,455 --> 00:56:37,750
你以为Chewie和我是靠运气找到了千年隼号?
Do you think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon?

694
00:56:37,775 --> 00:56:42,046
如果我们能在扫描仪上找到它，第一秩序也就离我们不远了.
If we can find it on our scanners, the First Order is not far behind.

695
00:56:42,047 --> 00:56:44,777
你想把BB-8送到抵抗组织
You want to get BB-8 to the Resistance.

696
00:56:44,802 --> 00:56:47,789
Maz Kanata是我们的最佳选择
Maz Kanata is our best bet.
[Maz Kanata:一名活了1000多年的星际海盗]

697
00:56:47,814 --> 00:56:49,435
我们能相信她不？
We can trust her, right?

698
00:56:49,436 --> 00:56:50,990
放心吧，孩子
Relax, kid.

699
00:56:51,015 --> 00:56:54,401
她经营这个酒吧已经千把年了.
She's run this watering hole for a thousand years.

700
00:56:54,426 --> 00:56:58,065
Maz可能有些古怪，所以我来负责交谈.
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so, let me do the talking.

701
00:56:58,066 --> 00:56:59,865
不管你做什么都不要盯着看
And whatever you do, don't stare.

702
00:56:59,890 --> 00:57:01,320
- 看什么?  - 看什么?
- At what?  - At what?

703
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:03,513
任何东西
Any of it.

704
00:57:24,026 --> 00:57:26,835
Han Solo!
Han Solo!

705
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:31,806
哦，我的天
Oh, boy

706
00:57:31,831 --> 00:57:33,604
嗨，Maz.
Hey, Maz.

707
00:57:36,723 --> 00:57:38,755
我的男朋友呢？
Where's my boyfriend?

708
00:57:39,077 --> 00:57:42,500
- Chewie正在千年隼号上工作   - 我喜欢那个伍基人
- Chewie's working in the Falcon.  - I like that Wookiee.
[Wookiee：Chewie是伍基人，生活在覆盖着巨大丛林的Kashyyk星球上的种族]

709
00:57:42,525 --> 00:57:46,191
我估计你急需一些东西.
I assume you need something. Desperately.

710
00:57:46,216 --> 00:57:48,100
过来吧.
Let's get to it.

711
00:57:55,768 --> 00:57:57,802
我马上回来
I'll be back.

712
00:58:12,633 --> 00:58:14,963
发现抵抗力量...
Resistance spotted...

713
00:58:14,988 --> 00:58:18,250
还有那个机器人
and your lost droid is here too.

714
00:58:22,445 --> 00:58:25,908
通知第一秩序...我找到那个机器人了
Inform the First Order... I found the droid.

715
00:58:41,615 --> 00:58:43,283
请原谅.
Forgive me.

716
00:58:45,785 --> 00:58:47,948
我又感觉到了
I feel it again.

717
00:58:51,050 --> 00:58:53,111
光明面的引力
The pull to the light.

718
00:58:55,418 --> 00:58:58,184
最高领袖觉察到了
The Supreme Commander senses it.

719
00:58:59,060 --> 00:59:00,842
请向我展示
Show me again.

720
00:59:00,867 --> 00:59:03,415
黑暗的力量
The power of the darkness.

721
00:59:04,373 --> 00:59:07,168
我将不会让任何事物阻挡我们的道路
And I will let nothing stand in our way.

722
00:59:07,981 --> 00:59:09,700
请向我展示...
Show me...

723
00:59:11,530 --> 00:59:13,457
...外公
... Grandfather.

724
00:59:15,295 --> 00:59:19,729
我会完成你的未尽事业
And I will finish what you started.

725
00:59:32,388 --> 00:59:33,848
一张能找到
A map...

726
00:59:33,873 --> 00:59:36,130
天行者的地图？
to Skywalker himself?

727
00:59:36,155 --> 00:59:39,413
我要你把这个机器人送到Leia那儿去
I need you to get this droid to Leia.

728
00:59:41,008 --> 00:59:42,489
不行
No.

729
00:59:43,161 --> 00:59:47,440
你已经逃避斗争太久了.
You've been running away from this fight for too long.

730
00:59:47,465 --> 00:59:48,918
Han.
Han.

731
00:59:51,445 --> 00:59:53,478
回家吧.
Go home.

732
00:59:53,511 --> 00:59:54,934
Leia不想见我.
Leia doesn't want to see me.

733
00:59:54,959 --> 00:59:57,789
拜托，我们来这儿是为了寻求你的帮助
Please, we came here for your help.

734
00:59:58,443 --> 01:00:00,206
什么斗争？
What fight?

735
01:00:00,378 --> 01:00:02,556
唯一的斗争
The only fight

736
01:00:02,581 --> 01:00:04,814
对抗黑暗面.
against the dark side.

737
01:00:04,839 --> 01:00:09,504
这么多年来我已经看遍了各种各样的邪恶.
Through the ages, I've seen evil take many forms.

738
01:00:09,529 --> 01:00:11,850
西斯、帝国
The Sith. The Empire.

739
01:00:11,875 --> 01:00:15,678
现在又是第一秩序.
Today, it is the First Order.

740
01:00:15,703 --> 01:00:18,881
他们的阴影在银河系中蔓延
Their shadows spreading across the galaxy.

741
01:00:18,905 --> 01:00:20,684
我们必须面对他们
We must face them.

742
01:00:20,709 --> 01:00:22,889
与他们斗争
Fight them.

743
01:00:22,914 --> 01:00:24,536
我们所有人
All of us.

744
01:00:24,715 --> 01:00:26,538
不能和第一秩序对抗
There is no fighting against the First Order.

745
01:00:26,563 --> 01:00:28,421
我们不可能取得胜利
Not one we can win.

746
01:00:28,582 --> 01:00:30,134
看看周围.
Look around.

747
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,506
我们已经没有机会了,我们被认来出了.
There's no chance we haven't been recognized us already.

748
01:00:32,531 --> 01:00:35,398
我敢打赌第一秩序的人已经在路上了...
I bet you the First Order is on their way right...

749
01:00:36,227 --> 01:00:37,657
这是什么？
What's this?

750
01:00:38,998 --> 01:00:40,486
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

751
01:00:44,930 --> 01:00:46,487
Solo，她在干嘛？
Solo, what is she doing?

752
01:00:46,488 --> 01:00:48,460
我不知道，但肯定不是好事.
I don't know, but it ain't good.

753
01:00:48,485 --> 01:00:54,103
如果你活得够久，你就能通过眼睛看清一个人.
If you live long enough, you see the same eyes in different people.

754
01:00:54,398 --> 01:00:59,244
我看到了一个想要逃跑的人
I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.

755
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,389
你根本就不了解我
You don't know a thing about me.

756
01:01:05,332 --> 01:01:08,697
我从哪里来，我都看到了些什么.
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

757
01:01:08,978 --> 01:01:11,928
我比你更了解第一秩序.
You don't know the First Order like I do.

758
01:01:12,330 --> 01:01:14,419
他们会把我们屠杀殆尽.
They will slaughter us.

759
01:01:14,684 --> 01:01:16,980
我们全都要逃.
We all need to run.

760
01:01:17,892 --> 01:01:19,081
嗯
Hm.

761
01:01:25,343 --> 01:01:26,825
看见那两个了吗？
You see those two?

762
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:30,182
他们会把货物运到外环行星
They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim.

763
01:01:30,207 --> 01:01:32,943
到了那儿，你就相当于消失了
There, you can disappear.

764
01:01:32,968 --> 01:01:34,370
Finn？
Finn?

765
01:01:35,835 --> 01:01:37,565
跟我走
Come with me.

766
01:01:37,932 --> 01:01:40,205
BB-8怎么办？我们还没有完成任务呢.
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

767
01:01:40,206 --> 01:01:42,235
我们必须把它带回去你的基地
We have to get him back to your base.

768
01:01:42,260 --> 01:01:45,003
你以为？他不行的.
You think? He can't.

769
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:48,461
我不能
I can't.

770
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,693
留着吧，孩子
Keep it, kid.

771
01:02:08,341 --> 01:02:10,381
这女孩是谁？
Who's the girl?

772
01:02:10,406 --> 01:02:14,682
- 啥？这是啥？  - 让他先说.
- What? What is it?  - Let him speak first.

773
01:02:14,707 --> 01:02:17,080
有人说你可以把我带到外环行星.
I was told you can get me to the Outer Rim.

774
01:02:17,105 --> 01:02:18,746
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

775
01:02:19,794 --> 01:02:21,567
别把我丢下了.
Don't leave without me.

776
01:02:24,545 --> 01:02:26,343
我不会让你就这样走了的.
You can't just go. I won't let you.

777
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:27,616
我不是你想的那样
I'm not who you think I am.

778
01:02:27,641 --> 01:02:30,534
- 你在说什么，Finn？  - 我不是抵抗组织的人
- Finn, what are you talking about?  - I'm not Resistance.

779
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:32,321
我不是英雄.
I'm not a hero.

780
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:37,176
我只是一个风暴兵
I'm a Stormtrooper.

781
01:02:38,131 --> 01:02:41,898
和他们所有人一样，从永无可能知道的家庭中被带走.
Like all of them, I was taken from my family I'll never know.

782
01:02:41,923 --> 01:02:44,369
饲养我们只是为了杀戮.
And raised to do one thing.

783
01:02:44,723 --> 01:02:48,057
在第一次战斗中，我做了选择
In my first battle, I made a choice.

784
01:02:48,888 --> 01:02:51,182
我不想杀他们
I wasn't going to kill for them.

785
01:02:51,330 --> 01:02:54,448
所以我逃跑了，正好遇到你
So I ran, right into you.

786
01:02:56,056 --> 01:02:58,701
你不像其他人那样看我
You looked at me like no one ever had.

787
01:03:00,940 --> 01:03:03,280
我为我所做的感到羞耻.
I was ashamed of what I was.

788
01:03:05,638 --> 01:03:07,899
不过，我和第一秩序已无任何瓜葛.
But, I'm done with the First Order.

789
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,972
我永远都不会回去.
I'm never going back.

790
01:03:11,607 --> 01:03:14,268
Rey, 跟我走
Rey, come with me.

791
01:03:14,468 --> 01:03:16,152
别走
Don't go.

792
01:03:20,955 --> 01:03:23,207
照顾好自己.
Take care of yourself.

793
01:03:24,545 --> 01:03:26,045
拜托了.
Please.

794
01:03:39,993 --> 01:03:41,721
别!
No!

795
01:03:42,081 --> 01:03:45,111
别!
No!

796
01:03:57,044 --> 01:04:00,885
别！回来！
No! Come back!

797
01:04:01,285 --> 01:04:03,376
别！
No!

798
01:04:16,545 --> 01:04:18,598
回来！
Come back!

799
01:04:19,702 --> 01:04:22,061
回来！
Come back!

800
01:04:31,638 --> 01:04:33,660
别！
No!

801
01:05:24,002 --> 01:05:25,814
别！
No!

802
01:05:26,134 --> 01:05:27,774
他的能量...
His energy...

803
01:05:54,092 --> 01:05:55,594
别！
No!

804
01:05:55,595 --> 01:05:57,923
回来！
Come back!

805
01:05:57,948 --> 01:05:59,793
安静点，小丫头.
Quiet, girl.

806
01:06:00,492 --> 01:06:02,099
不！
No!

807
01:06:05,616 --> 01:06:06,916
Rey？
Rey?

808
01:06:10,868 --> 01:06:14,666
这是你的第一步.
These are your first steps.

809
01:06:18,874 --> 01:06:20,441
那是什么？
What was that?

810
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:24,114
我不应该进来.
I shouldn't gone in here.

811
01:06:25,861 --> 01:06:28,692
那是Luke的光剑.
That lightsaber was Luke's.

812
01:06:28,717 --> 01:06:30,464
在那之前是他父亲的.
And his father's before him.

813
01:06:30,489 --> 01:06:34,095
现在，它在召唤你.
And now, it call's to you.

814
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:36,256
我必须回Jakku去.
I have to get back to Jakku.

815
01:06:36,281 --> 01:06:38,253
Han告诉我了.
Han told me.

816
01:06:45,591 --> 01:06:49,930
亲爱的孩子，我看了你的眼睛.
Dear child, I see your eyes.

817
01:06:49,955 --> 01:06:52,830
你已经知道了真相.
You already know the truth.

818
01:06:53,021 --> 01:06:56,059
无论你在Jakku等谁.
Whoever you're waiting for in Jakku.

819
01:06:56,834 --> 01:06:59,522
他们永远都不会来了.
They're never coming back.

820
01:07:04,771 --> 01:07:09,254
不过，还是有一个人可以
But, there's someone who still could.

821
01:07:11,214 --> 01:07:12,837
Luke.
Luke.

822
01:07:12,862 --> 01:07:16,585
你所追寻的不在你身后
The belonging you seek is not behind you,

823
01:07:16,610 --> 01:07:18,368
而是在前方.
it is ahead.

824

光明...
The light...

829

the New Republic lies to the galaxy
[New Republic：新共和国，由星战VI中打败了帝国武装的义军同盟改组而成]

838
01:08:40,404 --> 01:08:48,391
仍在暗中支持那些背叛的流氓抵抗组织
while secretly supporting the treachery of the rogues of the Resistance.

839
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:51,750
我们正站着的，由你们建造的
This fierce machine which you have built,

840
01:08:51,751 --> 01:08:56,510
这个终极武器，将终结参议院

841
01:08:56,511 --> 01:08:59,136
和他们珍贵的舰队

我看见你在跑，你还好吗？

一直把它锁着的

你从哪儿弄的？

好问题，改天再说.
A good question, for another time.

864

拿着，找到你的朋友！

那个机器人和一个女孩往西边走了.

从BB-8那儿只能恢复出一部分地图
but this map recovered from BB-8 is only partially complete.

963
01:22:45,529 --> 01:22:49,322
更糟的是，它与系统记录不相符.
And even worse, it matches no charted system on record.

964
01:22:49,347 --> 01:22:53,699
我们没有足够的信息来定位Luke大师
We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.

965
01:22:53,724 --> 01:22:57,371
真是太蠢了，我们以为可以找到Luke并把他带回家.
We are so foolish to think I could find Luke and bring him home.

966
01:22:57,396 --> 01:22:58,511
Leia.
Leia.

967
01:22:58,536 --> 01:22:59,783
不要那么做.
Don't do that.

968
01:22:59,784 --> 01:23:00,794
做什么？
Do what?

969
01:23:00,819 --> 01:23:02,480
任何事
Anything.

970
01:23:03,441 --> 01:23:05,049
公主.
Princesses.

971
01:23:05,976 --> 01:23:08,145
我只是想帮忙.
I'm trying to be helpful.

972
01:23:08,170 --> 01:23:11,539
你什么时候帮过忙？别跟我说死星那次
When did that ever help? And don't say the Death Star.
[Death Star：星战IV：新希望，在Han Solo和其他人的帮助下，天行者Luke成功击中了死星核心，导致死星毁灭]

973
01:23:18,306 --> 01:23:20,745
R2，我需要你的帮助.
R2, I need your help.

974
01:23:25,347 --> 01:23:26,514
醒醒，R2
Wake up, R2.

975
01:23:26,539 --> 01:23:29,262
BB-8，你在浪费时间.
BB-8.，You're wasting your time.

976
01:23:29,287 --> 01:23:30,327
他可能有地图
He might have the map.

977
01:23:30,352 --> 01:23:33,986
R2的数据备份里可不太可能有地图的剩余部分.
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data.

978
01:23:34,011 --> 01:23:35,904
- 能把他唤醒吗？  - 恐怕不行
- Can't we wake him?  - I am afraid not.

979
01:23:35,905 --> 01:23:40,571
自从Luke大师走了之后，R2D2就一直处于低功耗模式.
R2-D2 has been in low power mode ever since Master Luke went away.

980
01:23:42,601 --> 01:23:46,288
很可怜，R2可能永远都回不来了.
Sadly, he may never be his own self again.

981
01:23:46,430 --> 01:23:47,599
可怜的R2
Poor R2.

982
01:23:47,624 --> 01:23:49,288
听我说，好吧？
Listen to me, will you?

983
01:23:50,384 --> 01:23:52,456
我知道你每次...
I know every time you...

984
01:23:54,859 --> 01:23:57,167
每次你看到我就会想起他.
Every time you look me, you're reminded of him.

985
01:23:57,168 --> 01:23:59,409
你以为我想忘记他？
Do you think I want to forget him?

986
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,158
我想要他回来.
I want him back.

987
01:24:01,183 --> 01:24:03,560
这儿已经没什么我们可以做的了
There's nothing more we could have done

988
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,418
他实在是太像Vader了
There's too much Vader in him.

989
01:24:06,444 --> 01:24:09,344
这就是为什么我要Luke训练他的原因.
That's why I wanted him to be trained with Luke.

990
01:24:09,568 --> 01:24:13,038
只是我不应该把他送走，那时我就已经失去了他.
I just never should had sent him away, that’s when I lost him.

991
01:24:13,902 --> 01:24:16,260
那时，我失去了你们俩.
That's when I lost you both.

992
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:21,679
我们都不得不用自己的方式去处理
We both had to deal with it in our own way.

993
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:25,156
我只能继续做我擅长的事情.
I went back to the only thing I was only good at.

994
01:24:25,298 --> 01:24:27,048
我们都是这样.
We both did.

995
01:24:28,788 --> 01:24:31,971
我们永远失去了儿子.
We lost our son. Forever.

996
01:24:31,996 --> 01:24:33,184
不是的.
No.

997
01:24:33,209 --> 01:24:34,750
是Snoke.
It was Snoke.

998
01:24:34,775 --> 01:24:37,522
引诱我们的儿子进入了黑暗面.
He seduced our son to the dark side.

999
01:24:37,547 --> 01:24:40,048
不过我们还是可以挽救他.
But we can still save him.

1000
01:24:40,073 --> 01:24:41,643
我
Me.

1001
01:24:42,402 --> 01:24:43,702
和你
You.

1002
01:24:43,739 --> 01:24:46,358
如果连Luke都无法挽救他，我怎么可能做的到？
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

1003
01:24:46,383 --> 01:24:48,464
Luke只是绝地武士
Luke is a Jedi.

1004
01:24:49,351 --> 01:24:51,326
而你是他的父亲.
You're his father.

1005
01:24:53,451 --> 01:24:57,080
我知道，他身上还有一点光明.
There's still light in him, I know it.

1006
01:24:57,105 --> 01:24:58,727
将军.
General.

1007
01:24:58,752 --> 01:25:02,372
敌军基地的侦查报告出来了.
The reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.

1008
01:25:28,381 --> 01:25:29,952
我这是在哪儿？
Where am I?

1009
01:25:31,606 --> 01:25:33,233
你是我的客人.
You're my guest.

1010
01:25:33,234 --> 01:25:34,405
其他人呢？
Where are the others?

1011
01:25:34,430 --> 01:25:40,012
你是指那些杀人犯、叛徒和小偷？你把他们当朋友？
Do you mean the murderers, traitors and thieves, you called friends?

1012
01:25:40,219 --> 01:25:43,153
我不知道他们在哪儿，这下你放心了吧.
You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea.

1013
01:25:44,868 --> 01:25:47,228
你仍想杀了我.
You still want to kill me.

1014
01:25:47,420 --> 01:25:51,192
要是你继续带着这个丑陋的面具你就死定了.
That happens when you're being haunting by a contort mask.

1015
01:26:16,093 --> 01:26:18,017
说说那个机器人
Tell me about the droid.

1016
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:22,143
他是由二氧化硒驱动和热扫描XXX组成的BB型机器人.
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyper scan vindicator...

1017
01:26:22,168 --> 01:26:24,345
它带着一部分导航图.
Carrying a section of a navigation chart.

1018
01:26:24,370 --> 01:26:25,857
我们有其他的部分.
We have the rest.

1019
01:26:25,882 --> 01:26:28,714
从帝国档案中恢复的，我们需要剩下的那部分
Recovered from the archives of the Empire, but we need the last piece.

1020
01:26:28,739 --> 01:26:31,664
不知道你是怎么说服那个机器人秀给你看的.
Yet somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you.

1021
01:26:32,728 --> 01:26:34,284
你这个,
You,

1022
01:26:35,232 --> 01:26:37,016
捡破烂的.
a scavenger.

1023
01:26:38,741 --> 01:26:41,135
你知道我可以得到任何我想要的.
You know I can take whatever I want.

1024
01:26:47,082 --> 01:26:49,116
你真孤独
You're so lonely.

1025
01:26:50,966 --> 01:26:52,879
以至于不敢离开.
So afraid to leave.

1026
01:26:56,824 --> 01:27:00,095
晚上绝望的入睡.
At night, desperate to sleep.

1027
01:27:02,778 --> 01:27:04,688
想象一下海洋.
Imagine an ocean.

1028
01:27:05,352 --> 01:27:06,919
我看见了
I see it.

1029
01:27:07,834 --> 01:27:10,033
我看见了那个岛
I see the island.

1030
01:27:14,218 --> 01:27:16,075
还有Han Solo.
And Han Solo.

1031
01:27:18,036 --> 01:27:20,140
你以为他是你从未见过的父亲
You feel like he's a father you never had.

1032
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:21,818
他会让你失望的
He would have disappointed you.

1033
01:27:21,843 --> 01:27:24,005
滚出我的脑袋!
Get out of my head!

1034
01:27:24,534 --> 01:27:26,552
我知道你看过地图。
I know you've seen the map.

1035
01:27:27,770 --> 01:27:29,258
它就在你脑袋里面
It's in there.

1036
01:27:29,686 --> 01:27:31,830
现在你要把它给我.
And now you'll give it to me.

1037
01:27:39,603 --> 01:27:42,095
别怕，我也感觉到了.
Don't be afraid. I feel it too.

1038
01:27:44,209 --> 01:27:46,792
我什么都不会给你的
I'm not giving you anything.

1039
01:27:47,314 --> 01:27:48,705
走着瞧.
We'll see.

1040
01:28:28,621 --> 01:28:30,045
你...
You...

1041
01:28:30,378 --> 01:28:32,153
你害怕了...
you're afraid...

1042
01:28:34,442 --> 01:28:38,262
你永远不会像Darth Vader那样强大！
that you will never be as strong as Darth Vader!

1043
01:28:46,345 --> 01:28:48,660
这个捡破烂的
This scavenger

1044
01:28:48,685 --> 01:28:50,049
居然能抗拒你！
resisted you!

1045
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:51,799
她的原力太强了.
She is strong with the Force.

1046
01:28:51,824 --> 01:28:53,704
虽然没经过训练，但比她知道的更强
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1047
01:28:53,705 --> 01:28:54,992
那个机器人呢？
And the droid?

1048
01:28:55,017 --> 01:28:58,332
Ren觉得它已经没有价值了.
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us.

1049
01:28:58,357 --> 01:29:01,432
而那个女孩才是我们需要的
That the girl, is all we needed.

1050
01:29:01,433 --> 01:29:04,986
所以，那个机器人很有可能已经回到了敌人手中.
As a result, the Droid is most likely been returned to the hands of the enemy.

1051
01:29:05,011 --> 01:29:06,642
他们可能已经有了完整的地图
They may have the map already.

1052
01:29:06,667 --> 01:29:10,648
那么必须在抵抗组织找到天行者之前把他们消灭掉
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker.

1053
01:29:10,673 --> 01:29:12,500
已经找到他们了.
We have their location.

1054
01:29:12,525 --> 01:29:15,891
我们跟踪他们的侦察队到了Ileenium星系
We tracked their reconnaissance team to the Ileenium System.

1055
01:29:16,045 --> 01:29:17,540
很好
Good.

1056
01:29:17,565 --> 01:29:20,695
我们将彻底的摧毁他们.
Then we will crash them once and for all.

1057
01:29:20,720 --> 01:29:22,965
准备好武器
Prepare the weapon.

1058
01:29:22,990 --> 01:29:25,552
最高领袖，我能从女孩身上拿到地图
Supreme Leader, I can get the map from the girl.

1059
01:29:25,553 --> 01:29:28,170
我只是需要你的指引.
I just need your guidance.

1060
01:29:29,052 --> 01:29:33,816
如果关于这女孩的事是真的...
If what you say about this girl is true...

1061
01:29:33,841 --> 01:29:38,984
把她带给我
Bring her to me.

1062
01:29:52,461 --> 01:29:54,656
你会解除这些枷锁.
You will remove these restraints

1063
01:29:54,681 --> 01:29:58,534
打开牢门并离开
and leave this cell with the door open.

1064
01:30:01,595 --> 01:30:03,374
你说什么？
What did you say?

1065
01:30:06,182 --> 01:30:07,702
你会解除这些枷锁
You will remove these restraints

1066
01:30:07,727 --> 01:30:10,951
打开牢门并离开
and leave this cell with the door open.

1067
01:30:17,322 --> 01:30:19,250
我会锁紧这些枷锁，
I will tighten those restraints,
[我不会告诉你这个风暴兵是007 丹尼尔.克雷格演的]

1068
01:30:19,275 --> 01:30:21,632
你个捡破烂的！
scavenger scum!

1069
01:30:35,228 --> 01:30:36,886
你会解除这些枷锁
You will remove these restraints

1070
01:30:36,911 --> 01:30:39,948
打开牢门并离开
and leave this cell with the door open.

1071
01:30:43,063 --> 01:30:44,530
我会解除这些枷锁
I will remove these restraints

1072
01:30:44,555 --> 01:30:47,198
打开牢门并离开
and leave this cell with the door open.

1073
01:30:55,348 --> 01:30:56,761
并放下你的武器
And you'll drop your gun.

1074
01:30:56,786 --> 01:30:59,184
并放下我的武器
And I'll drop my gun.

1075
01:31:13,369 --> 01:31:14,669
不.
No.

1076
01:31:16,107 --> 01:31:18,060
守卫！
Guards!

1077
01:31:19,895 --> 01:31:22,003
守卫！
Guards!

1078
01:31:25,903 --> 01:31:28,179
开始武器充能
Begin charging the weapon.

1079
01:31:28,204 --> 01:31:31,291
是，长官，武器充能.
Yes, sir. Weapon charging.

1080
01:31:49,921 --> 01:31:53,479
Snap的侦察器的扫描数据证实了Finn的报告
The scan Data from Snap's reconnaissance flight confirms Finn's report.

1081
01:31:53,504 --> 01:31:57,140
不知怎么的他们在星球内部造了个超光速武器
They somehow created a hyper lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.
[我也不会告诉你这位Temmin“Snap” Wexley飞行员是由J.J发小Greg Grunberg演的]

1082
01:31:57,165 --> 01:31:58,265
激光炮？
A laser cannon?

1083
01:31:58,290 --> 01:32:00,191
我们不知道该如何描述这种规模的武器
We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.

1084
01:32:00,216 --> 01:32:01,495
这是另一个死星.
It's another Death Star.

1085
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:05,171
我也希望是这样，少校. 这是曾经的死星
I wish that were the case, Major. This was the Death Star.

1086
01:32:07,028 --> 01:32:09,967
而这个，是弑星者基地.
And this, is Starkiller base.

1087
01:32:09,992 --> 01:32:11,196
所以，它就是大.
So, it's big.

1088
01:32:11,221 --> 01:32:14,544
他们是怎么给这种规模的武器充能的？
How is it possible to power up a weapon of that size?

1089
01:32:14,545 --> 01:32:17,331
他们利用太阳能.
They uses the power of the sun.

1090
01:32:17,898 --> 01:32:21,109
给武器充能直到太阳被消耗殆尽.
As the weapon is charge, the sun is drained until it disappears.

1091
01:32:21,134 --> 01:32:22,383
女士
Ma'am.

1092
01:32:24,120 --> 01:32:27,933
第一秩序正在给终极武器再次充能.
The First Order charging their weapon again, now.

1093
01:32:27,958 --> 01:32:29,814
下一个目标就是我们星系
Our system is the next charge.

1094
01:32:29,839 --> 01:32:32,494
喔，天啊. 没了共和国舰队，我们要灭亡了.
Oh, my. Without the Republic fleet, we're doom.

1095
01:32:32,519 --> 01:32:34,581
好吧. 我们要怎么样才能把它炸掉？
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1096
01:32:34,606 --> 01:32:36,798
- 总会有办法的  - Han说的没错.
- There is always a way to do that. - Han's right.

1097
01:32:36,823 --> 01:32:39,432
为了让能量持续.
In order for that amount of power to be contained,

1098
01:32:39,457 --> 01:32:41,959
基地使用了某种热振荡器
that base has to have some kind of thermal oscillator.

1099
01:32:41,984 --> 01:32:44,765
这儿有一个. 47区
There is one. Precinct 47.

1100
01:32:44,790 --> 01:32:46,048
这儿
Here.

1101
01:32:46,048 --> 01:32:48,235
如果我们能破坏热振荡器,
If we can destroy that oscillator,

1102
01:32:48,260 --> 01:32:51,298
就有可能破坏核心并废掉武器
it might destabilize the core and cripple the weapon.

1103
01:32:51,323 --> 01:32:52,429
甚至毁掉整个星球.
Maybe the planet.

1104
01:32:52,454 --> 01:32:54,684
那我们就到那儿去，使用一切手段攻击热振荡器.
We'll go in there, we'll hit that oscillator with everything we got.

1105
01:32:54,709 --> 01:32:58,005
它们有防护罩，我们的飞船无法穿过
They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.

1106
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:59,979
我们要破坏防护罩
We disable the shields.

1107
01:33:00,004 --> 01:33:01,606
孩子，你曾在那儿工作
Kid, you worked there.

1108
01:33:01,607 --> 01:33:03,776
- 你能搞定吗？   - 我可以
- What do you got?  - I can do it.

1109
01:33:03,801 --> 01:33:05,015
我喜欢这家伙.
I like this guy.

1110
01:33:05,040 --> 01:33:08,579
我能关掉防护罩，但首先我必须到那儿
I can seal the shields, but I have to be there, on the planet.

1111
01:33:08,604 --> 01:33:10,863
- 我们可以带你去    - Han，怎么去？
- We'll get you there. - Han, how?

1112
01:33:10,888 --> 01:33:12,898
告诉你的话你肯定不会喜欢
If I told you, you wouldn't like it

1113
01:33:12,929 --> 01:33:14,347
所以，我们关掉防护罩
So, we disable the shields,

1114
01:33:14,372 --> 01:33:17,662
搞掉热振荡器并炸毁大炮.
we take out the oscillator and we blow up the big gun.

1115
01:33:18,339 --> 01:33:20,092
好了，我们出发！
Alright, let's go!

1116
01:33:41,670 --> 01:33:44,835
Chewie, 检查下设备. 赶紧的!
Chewie, check that thermal capitator. Come on, let's go!

1117
01:33:44,860 --> 01:33:47,212
嘿，小心点儿.那是炸药
Hey, be careful with those. They're explosives.

1118
01:33:47,247 --> 01:33:48,345
现在才告诉我？
Now, you tell me?

1119
01:33:48,370 --> 01:33:51,308
你知道吗？无论我们吵了多少次.
You know? No matter how much we fought,

1120
01:33:52,613 --> 01:33:55,317
我一直很讨厌看着你离开.
I always hated watching you leave.

1121
01:33:55,342 --> 01:33:57,165
我就是要这么干
That's why I did it

1122
01:33:57,985 --> 01:33:59,783
你想我了
So you'd miss me.

1123
01:34:02,089 --> 01:34:03,800
我想你.
I did miss you.

1124
01:34:05,360 --> 01:34:08,495
也不全是坏事，不是吗？哈?
It wasn't all bad, was it? Huh?

1125
01:34:08,601 --> 01:34:11,923
有些算是...好的
Some of it was... good.

1126
01:34:11,948 --> 01:34:13,433
非常好
Pretty good.

1127
01:34:16,672 --> 01:34:18,927
有些是永远不会改变的
Some things never change.

1128
01:34:18,952 --> 01:34:22,421
是啊，你依然让我神魂颠倒.
True.You still drive me crazy.

1129
01:34:31,393 --> 01:34:33,586
如果看到我们的儿子
If you see our son,

1130
01:34:35,646 --> 01:34:37,384
带他回家
bring him home.

1131
01:34:42,901 --> 01:34:47,216
长官，718吊架的传感器被触发，我们正搜查此区域
Sir. Sensors triggered in Hanger 718. We're searching the area.

1132
01:34:47,241 --> 01:34:49,395
她才刚开始测试她的力量
She's just beginning to test her powers.

1133
01:34:49,396 --> 01:34:53,830
越迟找到她就越危险.
The longer it takes to find her, the more dangerous she becomes.

1134
01:35:07,972 --> 01:35:09,434
我们怎么进去？
How're we getting in?

1135
01:35:09,459 --> 01:35:11,457
他们的防护罩有个刷新频率.
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate.

1136
01:35:11,482 --> 01:35:15,109
任何低于光速的飞行器都无法通过.
It keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through.

1137
01:35:15,134 --> 01:35:18,023
所以我们要以光速着陆？
We're making our landing approach at lightspeed?

1138
01:35:18,336 --> 01:35:20,214
Chewie，做好准备
Chewie, get ready.

1139
01:35:20,923 --> 01:35:23,244
现在！
And... Now!

1140
01:35:26,538 --> 01:35:28,691
我已经拉起来了！
I am pulling up!

1141
01:35:35,127 --> 01:35:38,071
不能再升高了，他们会看到我们！
I get any higher, they'll see us!

1142
01:35:59,192 --> 01:36:03,026
长官，718吊架那边没有发现，但所有部队已戒备.
Sir, she was not found in hanger 718, but all troops are on alert.

1143
01:36:03,051 --> 01:36:04,512
关闭所有吊架.
Put every hanger on lockdown.

1144
01:36:04,537 --> 01:36:07,413
她想偷船逃跑
She's going to try to steal a ship to escape.

1145
01:36:08,848 --> 01:36:10,742
Han Solo.
Han Solo.

1146
01:36:21,570 --> 01:36:23,415
泄洪道就在山脊那边.
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1147
01:36:23,440 --> 01:36:24,784
我们要从那条路进去.
We'll get in that way.

1148
01:36:24,809 --> 01:36:26,640
你在基地干什么工作?
What was your job when you were based here?

1149
01:36:26,665 --> 01:36:28,328
环境卫生
Sanitation.

1150
01:36:30,257 --> 01:36:32,230
环境卫生？
Sanitation?

1151
01:36:32,266 --> 01:36:34,206
那你怎么知道如何关闭防护罩？
And how do you know how to disable the shields?

1152
01:36:34,231 --> 01:36:37,051
我不知道，我只想来救Rey.
I don't. I'm just here to get Rey.

1153
01:36:37,076 --> 01:36:40,965
人民指望着我们，银河系指望着我们.
People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us.

1154
01:36:40,990 --> 01:36:43,118
Solo，我们会想到办法的.
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1155
01:36:43,143 --> 01:36:44,605
我们使用原力
We'll use the force.

1156
01:36:44,606 --> 01:36:47,013
原力才不是这么用的.
That's not how the Force works.

1157
01:36:47,038 --> 01:36:48,321
好冷
I'm cold.

1158
01:36:48,346 --> 01:36:50,637
哈，不是吧？你很冷？
Oh, really? You're cold?

1159
01:36:50,662 --> 01:36:52,018
跟上.
Come on.

1160
01:36:59,661 --> 01:37:00,995
报告.
Report.

1161
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:03,906
长官，还有15分钟武器充能完毕
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1162
01:37:05,649 --> 01:37:06,994
嗨！
Hey!

1163
01:37:09,815 --> 01:37:12,021
我们待的时间越长，运气就越少
The longer we're here, the less luck we're going to have.

1164
01:37:12,046 --> 01:37:15,243
- 防护罩.   - 我有个办法.
- The shields.  - I have an idea about that.

1165
01:37:20,976 --> 01:37:22,253
啊！
AH!

1166
01:37:22,278 --> 01:37:24,948
- 还记得我吗？   - FN-2187
- Do you remember me?  - FN-2187

1167
01:37:24,973 --> 01:37:27,931
不再是了.劳资自作主张叫Finn了
Not any more. The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1168
01:37:27,956 --> 01:37:30,012
现在我自由了，Phasma，我自由了.
I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.

1169
01:37:30,037 --> 01:37:32,076
- 冷静，冷静    - 好.
- Bring it down. Bring it down. - Okay.

1170
01:37:32,101 --> 01:37:33,775
跟着我.
Follow me.

1171
01:38:31,101 --> 01:38:34,225
想我爆掉你的水桶头吗？降下防护罩.
You want me to blast that bucket off your head? Lower the shields.

1172
01:38:34,226 --> 01:38:36,385
你犯了个大错.
You're making a big mistake.

1173
01:38:36,386 --> 01:38:37,759
快点.
Do it.

1174
01:38:42,714 --> 01:38:46,224
Solo，如果这方法管用，就没有足够时间去找Rey了.
Solo, if this works, we're not going to have a lot of time to find Rey.

1175
01:38:46,249 --> 01:38:47,986
别担心，孩子
Don't worry, kid.

1176
01:38:48,442 --> 01:38:50,825
我们不会丢下她就走的
We won't leave here without her.

1177
01:38:51,558 --> 01:38:54,476
你不会蠢到相信事情会这么简单吧.
You can't be so stupid just to think this will be easy.

1178
01:38:54,477 --> 01:38:57,234
风暴部队会全力进攻这儿并杀光你们
My troops will storm this block and kill you all.

1179
01:38:57,259 --> 01:38:59,603
我才不信呢，我们怎么处理这货？
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1180
01:38:59,628 --> 01:39:01,492
这儿有没有垃圾槽？
Is there a garage chute?

1181
01:39:01,976 --> 01:39:03,981
通往垃圾压缩机的那种？
Trash compactor?
[星战IV中，Han, Luke和Leia曾在帝国基地的垃圾压缩机里饱受折磨]

1182
01:39:04,250 --> 01:39:05,413
那就是.
There is.

1183
01:39:05,438 --> 01:39:07,291
将军，防护罩降下来了.
General, their shields are down.

1184
01:39:07,316 --> 01:39:08,883
感谢制造者！
Thank the maker!

1185
01:39:08,908 --> 01:39:10,852
Han搞定了！派战机过去.
Han did it! Send them in.

1186
01:39:10,877 --> 01:39:12,874
授权Poe进行攻击
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1187
01:39:12,875 --> 01:39:15,136
黑色领队，进行亚光速飞行编队
Black leader, go to sub-light speed formation.
[Poe Dameron 是 X翼战斗机组成的"黑色中队"（BlackSquadron）领队]

1188
01:39:15,161 --> 01:39:16,281
收到，基地
Roger, base.

1189
01:39:16,306 --> 01:39:18,773
红队，蓝队，听我指挥
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1190
01:39:18,916 --> 01:39:20,764
减慢速度.
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1191
01:39:34,038 --> 01:39:35,515
马上进入攻击范围！
Almost in range!

1192
01:39:35,516 --> 01:39:38,450
尽可能击中目标中心点.
Hit the target dead center as many runs as we can get.

1193
01:39:38,475 --> 01:39:40,205
接近目标.
Approaching target.

1194
01:39:44,316 --> 01:39:46,114
敌机来袭!
Fighters incoming!

1195
01:39:49,228 --> 01:39:50,316
升防护罩！ 升防护罩！
Shields up! Shields up!

1196
01:39:50,341 --> 01:39:52,024
派出所有中队
Dispatch all squadrons.

1197
01:39:52,049 --> 01:39:53,622
是，将军
Yes, General.

1198
01:39:54,075 --> 01:39:55,970
好了，让我们烧了它！
Alright, let's light it up!

1199
01:40:04,703 --> 01:40:06,045
哈！直接命中！
Ha! Direct hit!

1200
01:40:06,070 --> 01:40:07,166
没有损毁.
But no damage.

1201
01:40:07,191 --> 01:40:08,708
我们要持续攻击.
Yeah, we got to keep hitting it.

1202
01:40:08,733 --> 01:40:10,016
准备另一轮轰炸.
Another bombing run.

1203
01:40:10,017 --> 01:40:12,933
记住，当太阳消失时，他们的武器就要开火了.
Remember, when the sun is gone, their weapon will be ready to fire.

1204
01:40:12,934 --> 01:40:15,883
但只要还有光亮，我们就有机会.
But as long as there is light, we got a chance.

1205
01:40:16,131 --> 01:40:19,568
- Poe爷，敌人的战机！  - 伙计们，有很多客人来了！
- Master Poe, enemy fighters!  - Guys, we got a lot of company!

1206
01:40:36,785 --> 01:40:38,906
我们要炸掉那个防护门
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door.

1207
01:40:38,931 --> 01:40:41,608
然后我进去吸引火力，你来掩护我
I'm going in and draw fire but I'm going to need you to cover.

1208
01:40:41,633 --> 01:40:42,995
你确定要这样干？
You sure you are up for this?

1209
01:40:42,996 --> 01:40:44,081
当然不确定.
Hell, no.

1210
01:40:44,082 --> 01:40:46,995
我进去寻找Rey，风暴兵将会跟过来
I'll go in and try to find Rey. The troopers will be on our tail.

1211
01:40:47,020 --> 01:40:48,940
我们必须做好准备
We have to be ready for that.

1212
01:40:48,941 --> 01:40:50,931
哦，那边有一个隧道进到...
Oh, there's an access tunnel that leads...

1213
01:40:50,932 --> 01:40:53,585
你为什么那样做？嗯. 你为什么这样做？
Why're you do that? Hm. Why're you doing this?

1214
01:40:53,610 --> 01:40:55,453
我试着搞一个计划.
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1215
01:41:10,304 --> 01:41:11,526
- 啊！- 不！
- Ah! - No!

1216
01:41:11,551 --> 01:41:13,119
你没事吧？
Are you alright?

1217
01:41:13,144 --> 01:41:14,961
- 没事  - 很好
- Yeah.  - Good.

1218
01:41:14,986 --> 01:41:16,607
你怎么样了？他伤害你没？
What happened to you? Did he hurt you?

1219
01:41:16,608 --> 01:41:19,834
- Finn，你在这儿干什么？  - 我们是来救你的
- Finn, what are you doing here?  - We came to get you.

1220
01:41:21,001 --> 01:41:22,745
它在说什么？
What did he say?

1221
01:41:22,770 --> 01:41:24,588
它说这是你的主意
He says it was your idea.

1222
01:41:28,077 --> 01:41:29,797
谢谢.
Thank you.

1223
01:41:32,853 --> 01:41:34,627
你是怎么逃出来的？
How did you get away?

1224
01:41:34,652 --> 01:41:37,796
我无法解释，而且你也不会相信.
I can't explain it. And you wouldn't believe it.

1225
01:41:37,837 --> 01:41:40,533
现在赶紧逃，晚点儿再抱
Escape now, hug later

1226
01:41:55,353 --> 01:41:56,894
有个跟在我身后的
I got one behind me.

1227
01:41:56,919 --> 01:41:58,925
- 你看到了吗？  - 看到了，我来搞定
- You see it?  - Yeah. I'm on it.

1228
01:42:07,833 --> 01:42:09,793
当心地面火炮.
Watch out for ground fire.

1229
01:42:13,836 --> 01:42:17,285
他们有麻烦了，我们还不能走.
They're in trouble. We can't leave.

1230
