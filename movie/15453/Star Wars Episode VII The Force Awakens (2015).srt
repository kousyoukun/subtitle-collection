1
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:15,490
很久很久以前 在一个遥远的银河系...

2
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:38,340
卢克·天行者失踪了

3
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:40,680
在他消失的年月里

4
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:42,850
邪恶的 "第一秩序"

5
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,940
从银河帝国的余烬中悄然崛起

6
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:46,900
不除掉天行者——最后一个绝地武士

7
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:49,450
他们决不罢休

8
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,950
在新共和国的扶植下

9
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,130
莱娅·奥加纳将军

10
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,340
领导着一支勇猛的抵抗军

11
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:58,550
她迫切需要找到自己哥哥卢克

12
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,680
希望依靠他的帮助

13
00:01:00,850 --> 00:01:05,020
还银河以和平与正义

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:07,480
莱娅已经派遣了她最棒的飞行员

15
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,030
前往贾库执行秘密任务

16
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,120
那里有一位昔日的盟友

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,710
他找到了关于卢克行踪的重要线索...

18
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,940
这件东西会让一切都回归正常
This will begin to make things right.

19
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:02,860
我终日奔波 看尽世间百态
I've traveled too far and seen too much

20
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:05,910
这银河间充斥着绝望 我无法视而不见
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

21
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,870
没有绝地武士 原力就无法得到平衡
Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force.

22
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,250
多亏你 我们总算有了这个机会
Well, because of you, now we have a chance.

23
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:15,170
将军一直在找这样东西
The General's been after this for a long time.

24
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,000
将军吗?
Oh, the General?

25
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:19,460
对我而言 她可是皇室
To me, she is royalty.

26
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,460
可不是嘛
Well, she certainly is that.

27
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:28,470
有人来了
We got company.

28
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,070
你得藏起来
You have to hide.

29
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:44,610
而你该走了
You have to leave.

30
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,740
快走
Go.

31
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:21,440
快点 BB-8 速度!
Come on, BB-8, hurry!

32
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,830
炸掉那架X翼战机!
Blast that X-wing!

33
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:36,080
那边! 那边!
Over there! Over there!

34
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,210
我看到他们了
I see them.

35
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:15,830
你拿着这个
You take this.

36
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:17,830
它放在你这里要安全得多
It's safer with you than it is with me.

37
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:20,790
赶紧离开这儿 越远越好
You get as far away from here as you can.

38
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,670
听懂了吗?
Do you hear me?

39
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,170
我会回来的
I'll come back for you.

40
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:27,220
没事的
It will be all right.

41
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:27,570
继续走!
Keep moving!

42
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:31,070
你站在这里
Stay here.

43
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:57,350
看看你 已经如此苍老了
Look how old you've become.

44
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:00,980
而你已经变得不人不鬼了
Something far worse has happened to you.

45
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,770
你知道我是为何而来的
You know what I've come for.

46
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:06,060
我倒是知道你从何而来
I know where you come from.

47
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,110
在你自称为凯洛·伦之前
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

48
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:12,190
那幅能找到天行者的地图 我们知道在你身上
The map to Skywalker. We know you found it.

49
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:16,120
现在你要把它交给第一秩序
And now you're going to give it to the First Order.

50
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,700
第一秩序由黑暗面孕育而生
The First Order rose from the dark side.

51
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,790
但你不是
You did not.

52
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:23,460
我会向你展示黑暗面的力量
I'll show you the dark side.

53
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,790
随你怎么努力
You may try.

54
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,880
但你永远无法抹杀自己的家族传承
But you cannot deny the truth that is your family.

55
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,670
你说得太对了
You're so right.

56
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,000
那么谁先开口? 你先? 我先?
So, who talks first? You talk first? I talk first?

57
00:08:09,170 --> 00:08:11,050
那老头把地图交给你了
The old man gave it to you.

58
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:12,800
你戴着那么大个玩意 我啥也听不...
It's just very hard to understand you with all the...

59
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,510
- 搜身  - ...见
- Search him.  - ...apparatus.

60
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:20,430
- 什么都没有 长官  - 把他押上船
- Nothing, sir.  - Put him on board.

61
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,060
长官 这些村民怎么办?
Sir, the villagers?

62
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,860
全部杀光
Kill them all.

63
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,950
听我口令
On my command.

64
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,280
开火
Fire.

65
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,370
哦 不!
Please, no!

66
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:10,650
这里没有 继续向前!
Nothing here. Go ahead!

67
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:52,770
放手
All right.

68
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
放开!
All right!

69
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,470
FN-2187听令
FN-2187.

70
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:24,640
交出你的爆能枪接受检查
Submit your blaster for inspection.

71
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,560
是 队长
Yes, Captain.

72
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:29,810
还有 谁允许你擅自脱下头盔的?
And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?

73
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,480
对不起 队长
I'm sorry, Captain.

74
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,650
立刻到我的分部报到
Report to my division at once.

75
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:22,610
你今天带来的东西价值...
What you brought me today is worth...

76
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,400
嗯...
hmm...

77
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:28,450
四分之一份配额
one quarter portion.

78
00:15:26,930 --> 00:15:28,110
嘘
Shh.

79
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,440
那是个帝多 想把你拆了当零件
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

80
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,740
他根本不懂得尊重
He has no respect for anyone.

81
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:39,540
你的天线弯了
Your antenna's bent.

82
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:50,340
你从哪来的?
Where do you come from?

83
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:55,930
机密信息 真的假的?
Classified, really?

84
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,300
我也是 超大的秘密
Me too. Big secret.

85
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:01,310
尼伊马哨站是那个方向 别走开尔文山脉
Niima Outpost is that way. Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

86
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:03,310
离北边的流沙地带远点
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north.

87
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:04,850
你会淹死在沙子里的
You'll drown in the sand.

88
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:13,070
别跟着我 小镇朝那边走
Don't follow me. Town is that way.

89
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,280
不行!
No!

90
00:16:33,670 --> 00:16:35,300
明天一早你就得走
In the morning, you go.

91
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,220
不客气
You're welcome.

92
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:55,190
我完全不知道...
I had no idea we had...

93
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:58,030
我面前这位居然是抵抗军的首席飞行员
the best pilot in the Resistance on board.

94
00:17:00,450 --> 00:17:01,450
舒服吗?
Comfortable?

95
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,040
不怎么舒服
Not really.

96
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,790
我很佩服你
I'm impressed.

97
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,000
竟然没人能从你口中问出...
No one has been able to get out of you...

98
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:13,590
那地图的下落
what you did with the map.

99
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,420
你恐怕得反思一下自己的拷问技术了
You might want to rethink your technique.

100
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:34,230
地图在哪?
Where is it?

101
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:37,820
抵抗军...
The Resistance...

102
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,910
绝不会惧怕你的这些伎俩
will not be intimidated by you.

103
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,870
到底... 在哪?
Where... is it?

104
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:59,590
地图在一个机器人身上 型号是BB
It's in a droid. A BB unit.

105
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:02,140
好的 如果它还在贾库 我们很快就能找到它
Well, then, if it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it.

106
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:03,890
那就交给你了
I leave that to you.

107
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,730
别放弃希望 他也许会出现的
Don't give up hope. He still might show up.

108
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:10,940
那个你正在等的人
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

109
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,480
机密先生
Classified.

110
00:18:13,190 --> 00:18:15,230
我对等待这件事情再了解不过了
I know all about waiting.

111
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:18,280
我一直在等我的家人
For my family.

112
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:21,700
总有一天 他们会回来的
They'll be back. One day.

113
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:23,490
走吧
Come on.

114
00:18:26,490 --> 00:18:29,660
这五件东西价值...
These five pieces are worth...

115
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,620
我看看啊... 大概...
Let me see here... hmm...

116
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,710
半份配额
one half portion.

117
00:18:35,790 --> 00:18:37,500
上周每一件都能值半份呢
Last week they were a half portion each.

118
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:39,300
这个机器人怎么说?
What about the droid?

119
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,180
什么怎么说?
What about him?

120
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:45,470
我愿意出钱买下它
I'll pay for him.

121
00:18:51,350 --> 00:18:53,650
用六十份配额
Sixty portions.

122
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,660
事实上...
Actually...

123
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:10,580
这个机器人是非卖品
The droid's not for sale.

124
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,920
走吧
Come on.

125
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:20,590
跟着那个女孩 把机器人给我抢来
Follow the girl and get that droid.

126
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:25,890
伦想见那个犯人
Ren wants the prisoner.

127
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:36,400
进去
Turn here.

128
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,360
仔细听着
Listen carefully.

129
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,690
如果你完全照着我说的做 我能带你离开这里
If you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here.

130
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:42,780
什么?
What?

131
00:19:44,030 --> 00:19:46,110
这是一次救援行动 我要帮你逃出去
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

132
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:47,950
你会开TIE型战机吗?
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

133
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:49,110
你是抵抗军的人?
You're with the Resistance?

134
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,120
什么? 不 不 不是 我在帮你越狱
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

135
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,210
- 你到底会不会开TIE型战机?  - 我什么都能开
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?  - I can fly anything.

136
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:56,540
为什么? 你为什么要帮我?
Why? Why are you helping me?

137
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:59,630
因为这才是我该做的事
Because it's the right thing to do.

138
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:01,590
因为你缺个飞行员
You need a pilot.

139
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,050
因为我缺个飞行员
I need a pilot.

140
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:05,630
我们开始吧
We're gonna do this.

141
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:06,970
是吗?
Yeah?

142
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,480
好的 冷静 冷静
Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.

143
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:16,060
- 我很冷静  - 我在对自己说话
- I am calm.  - I'm talking to myself.

144
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:19,560
还没到
Not yet.

145
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,150
好的 到了 就是这里
Okay, go. This way.

146
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:31,490
我一直想试着飞一次这东西
I've always wanted to fly one of these things.

147
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,660
- 你会射击吗?  - 我会用爆能枪

用右边的屏幕瞄准

152
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,720
- 用扳机射击  - 这也太复杂了
- Triggers to fire.  - This is very complicated.

153
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,340
我能解决这个

154
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:55,180
发现一架战机未经许可驶离二号港口
We have an unsanctioned departure from bay two.

155
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,020
通报给赫克斯将军 阻止那架战机

156
00:21:18,710 --> 00:21:19,830

这家伙速度真快
This thing really moves.

159
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:35,180
我们得尽可能地摧毁这些加农炮...
We gotta take out as many of these cannons as we can...

160
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,390
不然我们跑不了多远的
or we're not gonna get very far.

161
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,890
- 好的  - 我会开到合适的位置上
- All right.  - I'm gonna get us in position.

162
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:38,980
保持警惕
Just stay sharp.

163
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:43,770
头顶上! 头顶上! 你看到了吗?

他们只给了我这个名字
That's the only name they ever gave me.

173
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:13,090
好吧 我可不愿意这么叫你 F-N 是吗?
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

- Good to meet you, Poe.  - Good to meet you too, Finn.

179
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,400
长官 他们击毁了我们的涡轮激光炮
Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers.

180
00:22:29,190 --> 00:22:30,570
那就用侧翼的加农炮
Use the ventral cannons.

181
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,820
遵命 长官 正在启动

182
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:35,620
赫克斯将军 是那个抵抗军的飞行员吗?

我们这是去哪?
Where are we going?

195
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:18,620
贾库 我们要回贾库去
We're going back to Jakku. That's where.

196
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,290
别 我们不能回贾库
No. We can't go back to Jakku.

197
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,830
我们得逃出这个星系
We need to get out of this system.

198
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:23,830
我得抢在第一秩序前找到我的机器人

199
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,170
- 什么 一个机器人?  - 没错
- What, a droid?  - That's right.

He's a BB unit, orange and white. One of a kind.

201
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,590
我才不管他是什么颜色!

202
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:29,920
哪有这么重要的机器人
No droid can be that important.

203
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,010
这个非常重要!
This one is, pal!

204
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:32,760
我们必须离第一秩序越远越好
We gotta get as far away from the First Order as we can.

205
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,180
如果回贾库 我们就死定了
We go back to Jakku, we die.

206
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,970
那个机器人带着一张能找到卢克·天行者的地图
That droid has a map that leads straight to Luke Skywalker.

207
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:38,970
你不是说真的吧!
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

208
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:45,150
FN-2187曾到我的分部报道...
FN-2187 reported to my division...

209
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,560
他接受了评估 之后被送去调整
was evaluated, and sent to reconditioning.

210
00:23:47,650 --> 00:23:49,900
没有任何叛变的前兆?
No prior signs of nonconformity?

211
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,900
这是他第一次有反抗的举动
This was his first offense.

212
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:53,110
将军!
General!

213
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:54,570
- 他们被击中了  - 击毁了?
- They've been hit.  - Destroyed?

214
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:55,910
失去动力了
Disabled.

215
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,410
他们在返回贾库的路上
They were headed back to Jakku.

216
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,730
战机的预计坠落地点位于戈亚逊荒漠
The fighter is projected to crash in the Goazon badlands.

217
00:23:59,780 --> 00:24:01,450
他们准备回去找那个机器人
They were going back for the droid.

218
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:03,500
派一支小队去战机残骸地
Send a squad to the wreckage.

219
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:27,020
波!
Poe!

220
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:29,650
波!
Poe!

221
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,520
波!
Poe!

222
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:36,490
波! 我找到你了
Poe! I got you.

223
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:39,660
波!
Poe!

224
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,540
波!
Poe!

225
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:13,960
最高领袖斯诺克的指示很明确
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.

226
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,550
捕获那个机器人 但如果不行就摧毁它
Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must.

227
00:26:16,630 --> 00:26:18,420
你的士兵水准如何 将军?
How capable are your soldiers, General?

228
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,030
我不会允许你质疑我的手段
I won't have you question my methods.

229
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:22,170
他们在触犯叛国法这条上明显水准更高一些
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason.

230
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,060
也许斯诺克领袖应该考虑改用克隆人军队
Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.

231
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,220
我的人都经过了严格训练
My men are exceptionally trained.

232
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:27,520
一出生就被洗脑
Programmed from birth.

233
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,890
那他们肯定能把那个机器人找回来
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid.

234
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
完整无损的

235
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,230
注意点 伦 别让你对地图的个人兴趣...
Careful, Ren, that your personal interests...

236
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:36,780
干涉到斯诺克领袖的命令
not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.

237
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:39,360
我要那张地图
I want that map.

238
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,820
为你自己考虑...
For your sake...

00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:42,160
我建议你还是把它拿到手

240
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:49,910

00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,370
什么? 诶 放开他!

245
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:36,840
嘿!
Hey!

246
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:55,270
这些是昂卡的人
They work for Unkar.

247
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:57,150
那个想买下你的家伙
That guy that wanted you.

248
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,860
看来他真是非常想得到你
He must have really wanted you.

249
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:03,110
谁?
Who?

250
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,200
他?
Him?

251
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,180
- 跑什么呢 小偷?  - 什么? 小偷?
- What's your hurry, thief?  - What? Thief?

252
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,800

253
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:31,180
- 嘿 你干嘛?  - 这件夹克
- Hey, what?  - The jacket.

254
00:28:31,260 --> 00:28:32,770
机器人说是你偷来的
This droid says you stole it.

255
00:28:33,730 --> 00:28:35,410
我今天过得非常不顺利 好吗?
I've had a pretty messed up day, all right?

256
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:36,600
所以我希望你能别...
So I'd appreciate it...

257
00:28:36,730 --> 00:28:37,940
继续指控我是个...
if you stop accusing me of...

258
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,480
- 噢! 住手!  - 你从哪里搞到这件衣服的?
- Ow! Stop it!  - Where'd you get it?

259
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:41,900
这衣服属于他的主人
It belongs to his master.

260
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:48,280
这是波·达默龙的衣服 他叫这个名字 对吗?
It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right?

261
00:28:50,330 --> 00:28:52,950
他被第一秩序抓到了
He was captured by the First Order.

262
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,660
我帮他越狱 但是途中飞机坠毁了
I helped him escape, but our ship crashed.

263
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,920
波没能活着逃出来
Poe didn't make it.

264
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:06,930
我尽力了 我很抱歉
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

265
00:29:15,100 --> 00:29:16,810
所以你是抵抗军的人?
So you're with the Resistance?

266
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,770

Obviously.

00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,230

268
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,610
我是抵抗军的人 对

我是抵抗军的人

270
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:31,410
我还从没见过抵抗军的战士
I've never met a Resistance fighter before.

271
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:34,410
好吧 我们就长这个样子
Well, this is what we look like.

272
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,040
有些人长这样 别的人长得不一样
Some of us. Others look different.

273
00:29:37,120 --> 00:29:38,580
BB-8说他有个秘密任务
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

274
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:40,170
他必须要回到你们的基地
He has to get back to your base.

275
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,540
很显然 他有一份能找到卢克·天行者的地图...
Apparently, he has a map that leads to Luke Skywalker...

276
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,300
并且所有人都在找这个
and everyone's after it.

277
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,630
卢克·天行者?
Luke Skywalker?

278
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:48,680
我以为他只是个传说
I thought he was a myth.

279
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,970
什么?
What?

280
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:00,520
- 你在干什么?  - 快跑
- What are you doing?  - Come on.

281
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,980
快跑 BB-8!

00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,920
- 放开我!  - 快点 我们得走了!
- Let go of me!  - Come on, we gotta move!

283
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:10,030
我会跑步 用不着你抓着我的手!
I know how to run without you holding my hand!

284
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,410
BB-8 跟紧了!
BB-8, stay close!

285
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,490
这边
This way.

286
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,500
呼叫空中支援
Call in the air strike.

287
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:24,880
快跑!
Come on!

288
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:27,580
我们俩都被盯上了
They're shooting at both of us.

289
00:30:27,670 --> 00:30:29,550
是的 他们看到你和我在一起 你也变成目标了
Yeah. They saw you with me. You're marked.

290
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,090
- 那真是谢谢你  - 嘿!
- Well, thanks for that.  - Hey!

291
00:30:31,180 --> 00:30:33,100
又不是我拿着根棍子到处追你
I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick.

292
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:35,810
这里的人怎么连爆能枪都没有?
Does anyone have blasters around here?

293
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:37,430
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

294
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:44,400
别再抓我的手了!
Stop taking my hand!

295
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:01,710
嘿
Hey.

296
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,040
你还好吗?
Are you okay?

297
00:31:08,050 --> 00:31:09,050
还行
Yeah

298
00:31:09,710 --> 00:31:10,840
跟我来
Follow me.

299
00:31:22,390 --> 00:31:23,640
- 我们跑不过他们!  - 不一定...
- We can't outrun them!  - We might...

300
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,020
用那艘四跃飞船就可以!
in that quadjumper!

301
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,440
嘿 得有个飞行员啊!
Hey, we need a pilot!

302
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:28,110
已经有了
We've got one.

303
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:29,230
什么 你?
You?

304
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,860
那边那艘飞船呢?
Uh, what about that ship?

305
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,400
那艘是垃圾!
That one's garbage!

306
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,370
垃圾也凑合吧
The garbage will do.

307
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:57,970
炮手位置就在下面!
Gunner position is down there!

308
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,850
你以前驾驶过这个吗?
You ever fly this thing?

309
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:06,100
没! 这艘船很多年没人用过了
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

310
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,270
棒极了
Great.

311
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,690
哇
Whoa.

312
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,900
我能行的 我能行的
I can do this. I can do this.

313
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,950
我能行的 我能行的
I can do this. I can do this.

314
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:39,140
嘿
Hey!

315
00:32:43,470 --> 00:32:45,020
那是我的!
That's mine!

316
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,190
等等 低空飞! 嘿 低飞!
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

317
00:32:50,310 --> 00:32:51,400
- 什么?  - 低空飞!
- What?  - Stay low!

318
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:52,690
这样可以扰乱敌人的跟踪
It confuses their tracking.

319
00:32:53,070 --> 00:32:54,990
BB-8 抓紧了!
BB-8, hold on!

320
00:32:55,150 --> 00:32:56,530
我低飞了!
I'm going low!

321
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:16,380
你在后面做什么呢?
What are you doing back there?

322
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:17,680
你还打不打算还击呀?
Are you ever gonna fire back?

323
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,890
我正在搞呢! 护盾打开了吗?
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

324
00:33:20,010 --> 00:33:21,680
没有副驾驶太困难了!
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

325
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:23,720
你倒是坐这里试试看
Try sitting in this thing.

326
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,360
我们需要掩护 快!
We need cover, quick!

327
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:40,820
很快就有了!
We're about to get some!

328
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:42,120
但愿吧
I hope.

329
00:34:07,810 --> 00:34:09,310
该死的!
Damn it!

330
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,070
快点 快点!
Come on, come on!

331
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:27,160
- 干得好!  - 我进步很快啊
- Nice shot!  - I'm getting pretty good at this.

332
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,860
加农炮卡住了 只能瞄准正前方
Uh, the cannon's stuck in forward position.

333
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:44,550
我动不了 只能靠你甩掉他了!
I can't move it. You gotta lose him!

334
00:34:48,430 --> 00:34:50,940
- 做好准备!  - 好的 准备干什么?
- Get ready!  - Okay. For what?

335
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,870
没搞错吧?
Are we really doing this?

336
00:35:15,290 --> 00:35:16,630
不好了
Oh, no.

337
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,070
哇!
Whoo!

338
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:54,960
- 射击技术好极了  - 你的飞行技术也棒极了
- Nice shooting.  - Now that was some flying.

339
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,040
- 谢谢  - 你怎么做到的?
- Thanks.  - How did you do that?

340
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:57,420
- 我不知道  - 没人教过你吗?
- I don't know.  - No one trained you?

341
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,250
我以前驾驶过一些飞船 但我从来没有离开过这个星球
I've flown some ships, but I've never left the planet.

342
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:00,500
- 最后那下射击太精准了  - 太精彩了
- Your last shot was dead-on.  - That was amazing.

343
00:36:00,590 --> 00:36:01,920
- 一击命中!  - 是你位置设计得好
- You got him with one blast!  - You set me up for it.

344
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:03,610
- 太完美了  - 相当不错
- It was perfect.  - That was pretty good.

345
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:09,010
没事的 他是抵抗军的
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

346
00:36:10,390 --> 00:36:12,020
他会带你回家
He's gonna get you home.

347
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,140
我俩都会的
We both will.

348
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,110
我还不知道你名字
I don't know your name.

349
00:36:23,070 --> 00:36:24,610
芬恩 你的名字呢?
Finn. What's yours?

350
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:27,200
我叫蕾伊
I'm Rey.

351
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,080
蕾伊...
Rey...

352
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,000
来帮忙 快!
Help me with this. Quick!

353
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,460
哇 怎么回事啊?
Whoa, what's going on?

354
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:49,890
长官...
Sir...

355
00:36:49,970 --> 00:36:52,600
我们没能在贾库抓到那个机器人
we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku.

356
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,900
它坐上一艘被盗的科瑞利安YT型号运输舰逃了
It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter.

357
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,530
机器人 ...
The droid...

358
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,240
偷了运输舰?
stole a freighter?

359
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,740
不完全是 先生
Not exactly, sir.

360
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,410
它有帮手
It had help.

361
00:37:11,030 --> 00:37:12,120
我们还不能完全确认...
We have no confirmation...

362
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,620
但我们相信 FN-2187也有参与其中
but we believe FN-2187 may have helped in the escape.

363
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:33,970
还有别的消息吗?
Anything else?

364
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:38,270
还有一个女孩跟他们俩一起
The two were accompanied by a girl.

365
00:37:43,690 --> 00:37:45,440
什么女孩?
What girl?

366
00:37:48,150 --> 00:37:49,240
是驱动器的问题
It's the motivator.

367
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,880
把哈里斯扳手递给我 去那边找
Grab me a Harris wrench, check in there.

368
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:51,910
情况有多糟?
How bad is it?

369
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,660
如果想活命 那情况就不好
If we wanna live, not good.

370
00:37:53,780 --> 00:37:54,740
他们正在追捕咱们呢
They're hunting for us now.

371
00:37:54,830 --> 00:37:56,000
我们得离开这个星系!
We've gotta get out of this system!

372
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,620
BB-8说抵抗军的基地位置...
BB-8 said the location of the Resistance base...

373
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:58,830
只能透露给"需要的人"
is "need to know".

374
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,580
如果要我带你到那里 我需要知道!
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

375
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:01,670
这个吗?
This?

376
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,550
你得告诉我基地在哪
You gotta tell us where your base is.

377
00:38:05,670 --> 00:38:07,260
我语言不通啊!
I don't speak that.

378
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,090
好吧 告诉你一个秘密...
All right, between us...

379
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,630
我不是抵抗军的
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

380
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,220
我只是想逃脱第一秩序
I'm just trying to get away from the First Order.

381
00:38:13,300 --> 00:38:15,060
但如果你告诉我们基地的位置...
But you tell us where the base is...

382
00:38:15,140 --> 00:38:16,560
我就先送你去那里 可以吗?
I'll get you there first. Deal?

383
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,140
- 机器人 拜托了!  - 派勒克斯起子 快点
- Droid, please!  - Pilex driver, hurry.

384
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:22,900
- 所以 你们的基地在哪里?  - BB-8 你快点告诉她吧
- So, where's your base?  - Go on, BB-8, tell her.

385
00:38:26,110 --> 00:38:27,110
求你啦
Please.

386
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:31,030
- 伊利尼姆星系?  - 是的 伊利尼姆星系
- The Ileenium system?  - Yeah, the Ileenium system.

387
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:33,040
对 就是那儿 尽快带我们去
That's the one. Get us there as fast as you can.

388
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:34,490
我会送你们俩到波尼马航空站
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

389
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,740
我需要胶粘带 快点!
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

390
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:36,910
那你呢?
What about you?

391
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,200
我要回贾库
I gotta get back to Jakku.

392
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:39,330
回贾...
Back to Jak...

393
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,830
为什么大家都想回贾库?
Why does everyone wanna go back to Jakku?

394
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,500
- 不是那个 不是 不是  - 那个地方是...
- It's not that one. No. No.  - That place is...

395
00:38:43,630 --> 00:38:45,500
我指着的那个 不是
The one I'm pointing to. No.

396
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,880
错了 不是!
No. No!

397
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:48,340
如果不修好...
If we don't patch it up...

398
00:38:48,510 --> 00:38:49,550
推进箱会溢出毒气...
the propulsion tank will overflow...

399
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:51,300
充满整艘飞船!
and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

400
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,380
- 这个?  - 对了
- This?  - Yes.

401
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:56,600
嘿 蕾伊 你是个飞行员
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

402
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,600
想飞去哪儿都行 为什么还回去?
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

403
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,980
你有家人吗?
You got a family?

404
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:01,190
你有男朋友吗? 帅哥男友?
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

405
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,770
不关你的事 这就是为什么
None of your business, that's why.

406
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,750
- 情况不妙  - 不 情况不妙
- That can't be good.  - No, it can't be.

407
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:13,570
我们的船被锁定了
Someone's locked on to us.

408
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,200
所有操作系统都被控制了
All controls are overridden.

409
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,710
放开手! 放开!
Get off! Get off!

410
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,460
看到什么了?
See anything?

411
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,920
不好了
Oh, no.

412
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:38,180
是第一秩序
It's the First Order.

413
00:39:38,260 --> 00:39:40,060
怎么办? 肯定有什么办法
What do we do? There must be something.

414
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:42,520
- 你刚才说到有毒气体  - 我修好了
- You said poisonous gas.  - I fixed that.

415
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:43,600
你能再弄坏掉吗?
Can you unfix it?

416
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,400
快点 BB-8
Come on, BB-8.

417
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:53,030
我接住他了
I got him.

418
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,120
我没事
I'm okay.

419
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:58,490
BB-8 不要压着我!
BB-8, get off me!

420
00:40:01,370 --> 00:40:03,040
你觉得这对冲锋队会有用吗?
Do you think this will work on the stormtroopers?

421
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:05,670
会的 他们的面具能过滤掉烟雾 但不能过滤毒素
Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins.

422
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,220
- 赶紧点  - 我赶紧着呢
- Hurry.  - I'm hurrying.

423
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:28,730
楚伊...
Chewie...

424
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:30,070
我们回家了
we're home.

425
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,250
其他人在哪儿?
Where are the others?

426
00:40:47,330 --> 00:40:48,920
- 飞行员在哪里?  - 我是飞行员
- Where's the pilot?  - I'm the pilot.

427
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,460
你?
You?

428
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,500
我说的是真的 船上就我们几个
No, it's true. We're the only ones on board.

429
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,010
你能听懂那东西?
You can understand that thing?

430
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:55,260
"那东西"也能听懂你...
And "that thing" can understand you, too...

431
00:40:55,340 --> 00:40:56,380
所以说话注意点
so watch it.

432
00:40:56,470 --> 00:40:58,390
快出来
Come on out of there.

433
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,970
- 你从哪儿弄到这艘船?  - 尼伊马哨站
- Where'd you get this ship?  - Niima Outpost.

434
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,640
贾库? 那个垃圾场?
Jakku? That junkyard?

435
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:04,930
谢谢! 听见没 垃圾场
Thank you! Junkyard.

436
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:07,100
告诉过你咱们得再检查下西部星带
Told you we should have double-checked the Western Reaches.

437
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:08,940
飞船落在谁手里? 杜凯恩?
Who had it? Ducain?

438
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,860
我从昂卡·普拉特那里偷的
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

439
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,150
他从欧文兄弟那里偷的 欧文兄弟又是从杜凯恩那里偷的
He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain.

440
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,570
杜凯恩则是从我手里偷的!
Who stole it from me!

441
00:41:15,650 --> 00:41:17,070
你去告诉他
Well, you tell him that

442
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:19,530
汉·索罗现在把千年隼永远地偷回去了
Han Solo just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good.

443
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:22,530
这是千年隼? 你是汉·索罗?
This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?

444
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,700
我曾经是
I used to be.

445
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,830
汉·索罗 那个著名的起义军将军?
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

446
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,290
不 那个著名的走私犯
No, the smuggler.

447
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,210
他不是个战争英雄吗?
Wasn't he a war hero?

448
00:41:31,290 --> 00:41:34,630
这就是在14秒差距内完成科舍尔航程的飞船?
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

449
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:35,970
是12秒差距!
Twelve!

450
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:38,510
什么14
Fourteen.

451
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:55,030
嘿
Hey!

452
00:41:55,530 --> 00:41:58,530
哪个白痴在点火线上装了个压缩器
Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line.

453
00:41:58,610 --> 00:41:59,700
昂卡·普拉特装的
Unkar Plutt did.

454
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,160
我也觉得这样不好 会让...
I thought it was a mistake, too. Puts too much...

455
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,530
超光速引擎负载过重
stress on the hyperdrive.

456
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:06,040
楚伊 把他们扔进逃生舱里
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

457
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,040
我们在最近的有人居住的星球把他们丢下
We'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet.

458
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,830
等一下 不要这样
Wait, no.

459
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:12,330
- 我们需要你的帮助  - 我的帮助吗?
- We need your help.  - My help?

460
00:42:12,420 --> 00:42:13,960
这个机器人需要尽快赶到...
This droid has to get to the Resistance base...

461
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,340
抵抗军基地!
as soon as possible.

462
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:18,420
他带着一份地图 能找到卢克·天行者
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

463
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,850
你真的是与义军一起作战的汉·索罗
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion.

464
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,940
你认识他的
You knew him.

465
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:39,400
是啊 我认识他
Yeah. I knew him.

466
00:42:39,490 --> 00:42:41,110
我认识卢克
I knew Luke.

467
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,200
别告诉我有一只拉斯鞑逃脱了
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

468
00:42:46,870 --> 00:42:47,870
等等 什么?
Wait, what?

469
00:42:48,790 --> 00:42:50,460
你刚才说有拉斯鞑?
Did you just say Rathtars?

470
00:42:51,210 --> 00:42:52,210
嘿
Hey!

471
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,840
你不会在用这艘运输舰运拉斯鞑吧?
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?

472
00:42:55,380 --> 00:42:57,590
我确实在运拉斯鞑
I'm hauling Rathtars.

473
00:42:57,670 --> 00:43:00,880
哦 太好了 是瓜维亚死神帮
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

474
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:02,430
肯定从南图区就开始跟踪我们了
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

475
00:43:02,550 --> 00:43:04,340
什么是拉斯鞑?
What's a Rathtar?

476
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,930
它们体型大 很危险
They're big and they're dangerous.

477
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:07,570
你听说过特里利亚大屠杀吗?
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

478
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:08,680
- 没  - 那就好
- No. - Good.

479
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:10,640
我给普拉纳国王弄到了三只
I got three of them going to King Prana.

480
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:13,060
三只? 你怎么把它们搬到船上的?
Three? How'd you get them on board?

481
00:43:13,150 --> 00:43:14,860
我以前的船员队伍人多
I used to have a bigger crew.

482
00:43:18,440 --> 00:43:20,360
呆在下面 我没说就不要出来...
Get below and stay there until I say so...

483
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:22,030
还有 休想开走千年隼
and don't even think about taking the Falcon.

484
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,110
BB-8呢?
What about BB-8?

485
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:24,910
我摆脱掉这帮家伙前 他得跟着我...
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang...

486
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:26,530
完事了你们再带他上路
then you can have him back and be on your way.

487
00:43:26,620 --> 00:43:28,660
拉斯鞑怎么办? 你把它们关在哪里?
What about the Rathtars? Where are you keeping them?

488
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:33,040
- 那里有一只  - 你要怎么办?
- There's one.  - What are you gonna do?

489
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,420
用我的老套路 磨嘴皮子
Same thing I always do. Talk my way out of it.

490
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:39,000
没错 每次都成功
Yes, I do. Every time.

491
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,270
汉·索罗
Han Solo.

492
00:43:58,360 --> 00:43:59,820
你死定了
You're a dead man.

493
00:43:59,940 --> 00:44:02,650
巴拉-蒂克 有什么问题?
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

494
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:05,530
我们借了你5万来干这趟差事
The problem is we loaned you 50,000 for this job.

495
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:08,160
- 你能看见他们吗?  - 看不到
- Can you see them?  - No.

496
00:44:08,330 --> 00:44:11,330
问题是 我听说你还从康吉俱乐部借了5万
I heard you also borrowed 50,000 from Kanjiklub.

497
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:13,660
你知道那些小怪胎是信不过的
You know you can't trust those little freaks.

498
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:16,750
咱们都认识多久了?
How long we known each other?

499
00:44:16,830 --> 00:44:17,920
他们有爆能枪
They have blasters.

500
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,090
而且很多
A lot of them.

501
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,380
没多久 我们要你还钱 立刻还
Not long. We want our money back now.

502
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,470
你以为抓捕拉斯鞑不用钱吗?
You think hunting Rathtars is cheap?

503
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:25,720
我把钱花了
I spent that money.

504
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:28,220
康吉俱乐部也希望收回投资
Kanjiklub wants their investment back, too.

505
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,640
我压根没有和康吉俱乐部做过交易!
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

506
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,600
那你跟康吉俱乐部讲啊
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

507
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:44,110
塔苏·利奇
Tasu Leech.

508
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,200
很高兴见到你
Good to see you.

509
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:49,300
错! 你要完蛋了!

510
00:44:54,040 --> 00:44:57,040
小子们 答应的好处我肯定会兑现的
Boys, you're both gonna get what I promised.

511
00:44:57,120 --> 00:44:58,500
我难道有哪次...
Have I ever not delivered...

512
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,090
- 是没给的吗?  - 有
- for you before?  - Yeah.

513
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:01,890
两次呢

514
00:45:04,380 --> 00:45:07,380
- 第二次是什么时候?  - 你的把戏没用了
- What was the second time?  - Your game is old.

515
00:45:07,510 --> 00:45:10,010
整个银河系都没人会再相信你的骗术
There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle.

516
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,910
你无处可逃了

517
00:45:12,680 --> 00:45:13,680
那个BB型机器人
That BB unit.

518
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,600
第一秩序要找的跟它长得一模一样
The First Order is looking for one just like it.

519
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:21,400
还有两名逃犯
And two fugitives.

520
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:26,400
我还是第一次听说过
First I've heard of it.

521
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,800
搜

522
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,410
等等
Wait, wait, wait.

523
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,620
如果我们关闭走廊里的防爆门...
If we close the blast doors in that corridor...

524
00:45:38,750 --> 00:45:39,880
就能把那两伙人都困住!
we can trap both gangs!

525
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,420
我们可以从这里关闭防爆门?
We'll close the blast doors from here?

526
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:43,300
把保险丝复位就可以了
Resetting the fuses should do it.

527
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:53,060
我有种不详的预感
I got a bad feeling about this.

528
00:45:53,140 --> 00:45:55,270
- 不好了  - 什么"不好了"?
- Oh, no.  - "Oh, no," what?

529
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:57,230
保险丝弄错了
Wrong fuses.

530
00:45:57,310 --> 00:45:58,480
杀了他们
Kill them!

531
00:45:58,600 --> 00:45:59,810
- 哇...  - 抓住那机器人!
- Whoa...  - And take the droid!

532
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:27,460
- 这是个错误!  - 大大的错误!
- This was a mistake!  - Huge!

533
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:41,690
它们长得什么样?
What do they look like?

534
00:46:47,650 --> 00:46:49,650
它们就长那样
They look like that.

535
00:46:51,910 --> 00:46:53,740
- 走这条路  - 你确定?
- This way.  - Are you sure?

536
00:46:55,660 --> 00:46:56,830
不要 不 不!
No, no, no!

537
00:46:57,870 --> 00:46:59,250
芬恩!
Finn!

538
00:47:00,250 --> 00:47:01,330
芬恩!
Finn!

539
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:03,500
蕾伊!
Rey!

540
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:07,960
走开! 走开!
Get off! Get off!

541
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:15,720
- 蕾伊!  - 芬恩!
- Rey!  - Finn!

542
00:47:16,930 --> 00:47:18,020
芬恩!
Finn!

543
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,350
走开!
Get off me!

544
00:47:32,030 --> 00:47:33,530
蕾伊!
Rey!

545
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:39,450
走开! 走开!
Get off! Get off!

546
00:47:41,870 --> 00:47:43,370
芬恩!
Finn!

547
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,380
- 它抓到我了! 但是门...  - 真幸运
- It had me! But the door... - That was lucky.

548
00:47:50,420 --> 00:47:52,720
我来弄门 掩护我们!
I got the door. Cover us!

549
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:01,430
楚伊!
Chewie!

550
00:48:04,310 --> 00:48:05,900
你没事吧?
You okay?

551
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:08,070
哇
Wow.

552
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:12,490
加油! 加油!
Come on! Come on!

553
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:17,240
汉
Han.

554
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,580
你 关上你后面的门 你照顾楚伊!
You, close the door behind us. You, take care of Chewie!

555
00:48:27,250 --> 00:48:28,500
嘿 你要去哪?
Hey, where are you going?

556
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:30,250
昂卡·普拉特还安装了一个燃油泵
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

557
00:48:30,340 --> 00:48:32,130
不把它准备好 这船哪儿都去不了
If we don't prime that, we're not going anywhere.

558
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:33,420
我讨厌那个家伙
I hate that guy.

559
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:36,050
- 你也需要个副驾驶  - 我的副驾驶在后面呢
- And you could use a co-pilot. - I got one, he's back there.

560
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,470
看着推力器 我们要用光速离开这里
Watch the thrust. We're going out of here at lightspeed.

561
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,400
从机库里面? 可能吗?
From inside the hangar? Is that even possible?

562
00:48:42,470 --> 00:48:44,730
我向来都是做了再问
I never ask that question till after I've done it.

563
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:49,110
我预想中的今天可不是这个样子
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go.

564
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:51,190
调整护盾位置 后面的人抓紧了
Angle the shield. Hang on back there.

565
00:48:51,270 --> 00:48:52,440
没问题
No problem!

566
00:49:02,370 --> 00:49:03,690
加油 宝贝 不要让我失望
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

567
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,130
- 什么?  - 压缩机
- What? - Compressor.

568
00:49:16,630 --> 00:49:17,840
通知第一秩序...
Inform the First Order...

569
00:49:17,930 --> 00:49:19,760
汉·索罗手上有他们想要的机器人
that Han Solo has the droid they want.

570
00:49:19,850 --> 00:49:21,850
就在千年隼上
And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.

571
00:49:30,770 --> 00:49:35,150
机器人很快就能被送到抵抗军手上...
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance...

572
00:49:36,360 --> 00:49:40,160
带领他们找到最后的绝地武士
leading them to the last Jedi.

573
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:45,120
如果天行者重现...
If Skywalker returns...

574
00:49:45,660 --> 00:49:49,670
新的绝地武士会崛起
the new Jedi will rise.

575
00:49:50,830 --> 00:49:52,380
最高领袖 我愿承担全部责任...
Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility...

576
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:54,170
将军!
General!

577
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:59,180
如今我们必须要改变战略了
Our strategy must now change.

578
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,340
武器 已准备就绪
The weapon. It is ready.

579
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,720
我相信现在是用它的时候了
I believe the time has come to use it.

580
00:50:03,850 --> 00:50:05,140
我们当摧毁那个...
We shall destroy the government...

581
00:50:05,220 --> 00:50:06,640
支持抵抗军的政府...
that supports the Resistance...

582
00:50:06,730 --> 00:50:08,440
新共和国政府
the Republic.

583
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,120
失去了朋友的保护...
Without their friends to protect them...

584
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:11,730
抵抗军将不堪一击
the Resistance will be vulnerable.

585
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:14,900
我们要在他们找到天行者之前拦住他们
And we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.

586
00:50:14,980 --> 00:50:16,230
去吧
Go.

587
00:50:17,030 --> 00:50:18,450
监督备战
Oversee preparations.

588
00:50:18,530 --> 00:50:20,200
收到 最高领袖
Yes, Supreme Leader.

589
00:50:26,160 --> 00:50:27,540
有东西觉醒了
There has been an awakening.

590
00:50:29,250 --> 00:50:31,000
你感觉到了吗?
Have you felt it?

591
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:33,590
是的
Yes.

592
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,590
还有件事
There's something more.

593
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:42,300
我们要找的机器人就在千年隼号上
The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon.

594
00:50:43,090 --> 00:50:45,970
你父亲的手上...
In the hands of your father...

595
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,890
汉·索罗
Han Solo.

596
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:54,900
他对我来说什么也不是
He means nothing to me.

597
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:59,820
哪怕是你 伦武士团的团长...
Even you, master of the Knights of Ren...

598
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:03,910
也不曾面临过这种考验
have never faced such a test.

599
00:51:04,530 --> 00:51:07,740
您如此悉心栽培我 我不会动摇
By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.

600
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,710
让我们拭目以待
We shall see.

601
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:15,130
拭目以待
We shall see.

602
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:25,430
- 电量超负荷了  - 我能修复
- Electrical overload.  - I can fix that.

603
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:26,810
冷却剂泄露
Coolant's leaking.

604
00:51:28,140 --> 00:51:29,390
试试把辅助电源...
Try transferring auxiliary power...

605
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,890
转到备用燃料箱
to the secondary tank.

606
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,520
明白
I got it.

607
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:34,310
楚伊 别!
Chewie, come on!

608
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:37,540
谁帮我弄走这个大毛怪!
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

609
00:51:37,610 --> 00:51:38,610
别动!
Stop moving!

610
00:51:40,650 --> 00:51:42,450
楚伊!
Chewie!

611
00:51:42,570 --> 00:51:44,280
你敢动楚伊试试 我跟你没完!
You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!

612
00:51:44,410 --> 00:51:46,740
动他? 他都快把我弄死六次了!
Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!

613
00:51:47,660 --> 00:51:49,120
虽然我不介意!
Which is fine!

614
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:50,700
如果这个超光速引擎爆炸 我们就会...
This hyperdrive blows, there are gonna be...

615
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:52,750
被炸到几个星系开外
pieces of us in three different systems.

616
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:57,130
你怎么做到的?
What'd you do?

617
00:51:58,170 --> 00:52:00,090
我绕过了压缩器
I bypassed the compressor.

618
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:07,970
走开 球球
Move, ball.

619
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:12,230
啊 别这样说
Ah, don't say that.

620
00:52:12,310 --> 00:52:13,980
你们干得很棒 休息下吧
You did great. Just rest.

621
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:15,980
孩子 干得好
Good job, kid.

622
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:17,440
谢谢
Thanks.

623
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,270
没事
You're welcome.

624
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:25,450
所以...
So...

625
00:52:25,570 --> 00:52:26,910
逃犯 是吧?
fugitives, huh?

626
00:52:28,830 --> 00:52:30,120
第一秩序想拿到地图
The First Order wants the map.

627
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:31,490
芬恩是抵抗军的一员
Finn is with the Resistance.

628
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:33,540
我只是个捡破烂的
I'm just a scavenger.

629
00:52:35,580 --> 00:52:36,580
让我们瞧瞧你都找到些什么
Let's see what you got.

630
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,540
来吧
Go ahead.

631
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:50,850
地图不完整
This map's not complete.

632
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,430
只是一块碎片
It's just a piece.

633
00:52:53,640 --> 00:52:55,440
自从卢克失踪...
Ever since Luke disappeared...

634
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:57,560
大家都一直在找他
people have been looking for him.

635
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:59,150
他为什么要离开?
Why did he leave?

636
00:53:00,360 --> 00:53:03,110
当时他在训练新一代的绝地武士
He was training a new generation of Jedi.

637
00:53:03,190 --> 00:53:04,860
一个男孩 他的徒弟...
One boy, an apprentice...

638
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,240
背叛了他 毁了一切
turned against him, destroyed it all.

639
00:53:08,820 --> 00:53:10,740
卢克觉得是他的责任
Luke felt responsible.

640
00:53:10,830 --> 00:53:13,330
他只想逃避一切
He just walked away from everything.

641
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:15,500
你知道他后来怎么样了吗?
Do you know what happened to him?

642
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:18,040
坊间有很多传闻 故事
A lot of rumors. Stories.

643
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,250
最熟悉他的人...
People that knew him best...

644
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,130
认为他去找最初的绝地圣殿了
think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.

645
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:29,220
绝地真的存在吗?
The Jedi were real?

646
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:31,510
一开始我也很困惑
I used to wonder about that myself.

647
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:33,810
觉得这只是一堆神神叨叨
Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.

648
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:37,270
一种兼具了正义与邪恶的神秘力量...
A magical power holding together good and evil...

649
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:39,480
黑暗与光明共存
the dark side and the light.

650
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:43,020
最疯狂的是...
Crazy thing is...

651
00:53:45,820 --> 00:53:46,860
这的确是真的
it's true.

652
00:53:49,410 --> 00:53:51,030
原力 绝地
The Force. The Jedi.

653
00:53:53,620 --> 00:53:54,620
这一切
All of it.

654
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,210
全都是真的
It's all true.

655
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:04,590
不 你歇歇吧
No, you rest.

656
00:54:04,710 --> 00:54:07,470
你想要我的帮助? 快了
You want my help? You're getting it.

657
00:54:07,550 --> 00:54:09,590
待会要见一个老朋友 她会把你们的机器人带回去的
Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home.

658
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:12,220
我们到站了
This is our stop.

659
00:54:29,610 --> 00:54:31,110
我从来不知道整个银河系中...
I didn't know there was this much green...

660
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:32,490
还有如此一片绿园
in the whole galaxy.

661
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,520
嘿 索罗 我不确定咱们来这儿是要干...
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what we're walking into here...

662
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:04,270
你刚叫我索罗?
Did you just call me Solo?

663
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,980
不好意思 索罗先生
Sorry. Han. Mr.Solo.

664
00:55:06,070 --> 00:55:07,150
你应该知道...
You should know...

665
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:09,610
我是抵抗军里的大人物
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

666
00:55:09,690 --> 00:55:12,030
我简直是一个移动的靶子
Which puts a real target on my back.

667
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,740
这里有任何阴谋者吗?
Are there any conspirators here?

668
00:55:13,820 --> 00:55:15,700
比如 第一秩序的支持者?
Like, First Order sympathizers?

669
00:55:15,830 --> 00:55:18,500
听着 大人物
Listen, Big Deal.

670
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,500
你还有一个麻烦
You got another problem.

671
00:55:20,580 --> 00:55:22,750
女人往往能找出真相
Women always figure out the truth.

672
00:55:24,330 --> 00:55:25,670
往往
Always.

673
00:55:31,670 --> 00:55:33,050
这个你也许用得上
You might need this.

674
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:36,010
我觉得我能照顾好自己
I think I can handle myself.

675
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,260
我知道 所以我要给你这个
I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you.

676
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:39,350
拿着吧
Take it.

677
00:55:42,190 --> 00:55:43,350
你知道怎么用吗?
You know how to use one of those?

678
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,100
知道 扣动扳机
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

679
00:55:45,190 --> 00:55:47,020
这样可不够
Little bit more to it than that.

680
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,190
你还有许多要学的
You got a lot to learn.

681
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:51,860
你的名字是?
You got a name?

682
00:55:52,780 --> 00:55:53,780
蕾伊
Rey.

683
00:55:54,490 --> 00:55:55,490
蕾伊
Rey.

684
00:55:59,370 --> 00:56:01,790
我一直在考虑添两个船员 蕾伊
I been thinking about bringing on some more crew, Rey.

685
00:56:01,870 --> 00:56:03,830
一个副手 能帮我的忙
A second mate. Someone to help out.

686
00:56:03,920 --> 00:56:05,540
一个能跟得上楚伊和我...
Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me...

687
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,210
又欣赏千年隼的人
appreciates the Falcon.

688
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:09,130
你在给我工作机会吗?
Are you offering me a job?

689
00:56:09,210 --> 00:56:11,710
我可不是个好老板 能付的报酬不多
I wouldn't be nice to you. Doesn't pay much.

690
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,680
你在给我工作机会
You're offering me a job.

691
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,390
我的确在考虑
I'm thinking about it.

692
00:56:20,060 --> 00:56:21,220
怎么样?
Well?

693
00:56:25,730 --> 00:56:28,400
你能这么考虑我真是受宠若惊 但我得回家
If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home.

694
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:30,820
哪里 贾库?
Where, Jakku?

695
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,190
我离家太久了
I've already been away too long.

696
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:37,280
楚伊 好好检查下船
Chewie, check out the ship as best you can.

697
00:56:40,990 --> 00:56:43,910
真可惜 楚伊挺喜欢你的
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.

698
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,670
索罗 再说一遍我们为什么来这儿?
Solo, why are we here again?

699
00:56:48,790 --> 00:56:50,300
为了把你的机器人放到一艘清白的船上
To get your droid on a clean ship.

700
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:51,420
清白?
Clean?

701
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:54,340
你以为楚伊和我只是碰巧找到的千年隼吗?
You think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon?

702
00:56:55,010 --> 00:56:56,550
如果我们可以在扫描仪上找到它...
If we can find it on our scanners...

703
00:56:56,630 --> 00:56:58,970
第一秩序离我们也不远了
the First Order's not far behind.

704
00:56:59,100 --> 00:57:01,890
想把BB-8送回抵抗军?
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

705
00:57:01,970 --> 00:57:03,810
玛兹·卡纳塔是我们最好的选择
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

706
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,190
我们能信任她 是吗?
We can trust her, right?

707
00:57:06,270 --> 00:57:07,810
放轻松 孩子
Relax, kid.

708
00:57:07,940 --> 00:57:10,610
她经营这个酒吧已经千年了
She's run this watering hole for a thousand years.

709
00:57:11,360 --> 00:57:13,400
玛兹口味有点独特...
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste...

710
00:57:13,480 --> 00:57:14,860
让我来跟她谈
so let me do the talking.

711
00:57:14,940 --> 00:57:16,700
不管你做什么 不要盯着看
And whatever you do, don't stare.

712
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:17,820
看什么?
At what?

713
00:57:18,870 --> 00:57:19,950
任何东西
Any of it.

714
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:43,140
汉·索罗!
Han Solo!

715
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:48,560
天了噜
Oh, boy.

716
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:49,850
嘿 玛兹
Hey, Maz.

717
00:57:53,690 --> 00:57:55,650
我男朋友呢?
Where's my boyfriend?

718
00:57:56,150 --> 00:57:57,780
楚伊在千年隼上干活呢
Chewie's working on the Falcon.

719
00:57:57,860 --> 00:57:58,860
我喜欢那个伍基人
I like that Wookiee.

720
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,620
我猜你需要点什么
I assume you need something.

721
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:03,120
很急
Desperately.

722
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,200
我们来谈谈吧
Let's get to it.

723
00:58:29,540 --> 00:58:31,660
抵抗军请警惕...

724
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,040
他们丢失的机器人在这儿!

725
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:43,720
告诉第一秩序... 我找到机器人了

726
00:58:58,760 --> 00:59:00,220
原谅我
Forgive me.

727
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:04,550
它又出现了
I feel it again.

728
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:09,770
光明面的引力
The pull to the light.

729
00:59:12,600 --> 00:59:15,110
最高领袖已经感觉到了
Supreme Leader senses it.

730
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,570
让我再看看
Show me again.

731
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:20,240
黑暗面的力量吧
The power of the darkness.

732
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:24,120
我就不会让任何东西阻碍我了
And I will let nothing stand in our way.

733
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:26,450
让我看看吧...
Show me...

734
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:29,950
外祖父...
Grandfather...

735
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,750
然后我将完成...
and I will finish...

736
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:36,250
您未完的大业
what you started.

737
00:59:49,060 --> 00:59:50,480
一张地图
A map.

738
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:53,230
靠它能找到天行者?
To Skywalker himself?

739
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:56,060
你又要重出江湖了
You are right back in the mess.

740
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:59,610
玛兹 我需要你把这机器人带给莱娅
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

741
01:00:01,570 --> 01:00:02,570
不
No.

742
01:00:03,950 --> 01:00:07,950
你逃离这场战争的时间太久了
You've been running away from this fight for too long.

743
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:09,450
汉
Han.

744
01:00:12,120 --> 01:00:13,620
回家吧
Go home.

745
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:15,580
莱娅不会想见我的
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

746
01:00:15,670 --> 01:00:17,880
拜托了 我们来这儿就是为了得到你的帮助
Please, we came here for your help.

747
01:00:19,130 --> 01:00:20,130
什么战争?
What fight?

748
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:23,380
唯一的战争
The only fight.

749
01:00:23,470 --> 01:00:25,640
对抗黑暗面
Against the dark side.

750
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,050
这么多年来...
Through the ages...

751
01:00:27,140 --> 01:00:29,260
我看到邪恶力量换了许多面孔
I've seen evil take many forms.

752
01:00:30,350 --> 01:00:32,560
西斯 帝国
The Sith. The Empire.

753
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:35,980
现在是第一秩序
Today, it is the First Order.

754
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:39,690
他们的阴影笼罩整片银河
Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy.

755
01:00:39,820 --> 01:00:41,190
我们必须直面他们
We must face them.

756
01:00:41,320 --> 01:00:43,360
与他们战斗
Fight them.

757
01:00:43,490 --> 01:00:45,030
所有人一起
All of us.

758
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:47,240
哪有什么跟第一秩序的斗争
There is no fight against the First Order.

759
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:48,450
我们赢不了的
Not one we can win.

760
01:00:49,660 --> 01:00:50,910
看看周围
Look around.

761
01:00:50,990 --> 01:00:53,370
我们肯定早就被认出来了
There's no chance we haven't been recognized already.

762
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,710
我敢打赌第一秩序已经在追来的路上了...
I bet you the First Order is on their way right...

763
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,000
这是什么?
What's this?

764
01:00:59,840 --> 01:01:00,840
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

765
01:01:05,550 --> 01:01:07,050
索罗 她在干什么?
Solo, what is she doing?

766
01:01:07,180 --> 01:01:08,930
我不知道 看上去不妙
I don't know. But it ain't good.

767
01:01:09,100 --> 01:01:10,890
如果你活得够长...
If you live long enough...

768
01:01:10,970 --> 01:01:14,480
你会在不同人的身上看到同一双眼睛
you see the same eyes in different people.

769
01:01:15,390 --> 01:01:19,860
我现在看到的就是一双逃跑者的眼睛
I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.

770
01:01:22,730 --> 01:01:24,690
你根本不了解我
You don't know a thing about me.

771
01:01:26,030 --> 01:01:29,030
我打哪儿来 我看到过什么
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

772
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:32,370
你不像我那么了解第一秩序
You don't know the First Order like I do.

773
01:01:33,330 --> 01:01:35,500
他们会将我们屠杀殆尽
They'll slaughter us.

774
01:01:35,580 --> 01:01:37,710
我们都得逃
We all need to run.

775
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:47,180
你看到那两人了吗?
You see those two?

776
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,510
你替他们干活 他们就能...
They'll trade work for transportation...

777
01:01:49,640 --> 01:01:51,050
把你送去外环
to the Outer Rim.

778
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,350
在那里 你可以消失
There, you can disappear.

779
01:01:53,560 --> 01:01:54,560
芬恩?
Finn?

780
01:01:56,980 --> 01:01:57,980
跟我一起走
Come with me.

781
01:01:59,020 --> 01:02:01,060
那BB-8呢? 我们的任务还没完成
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

782
01:02:01,150 --> 01:02:02,820
我们得把他带到你的基地
We have to get him back to your base.

783
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,240
我不能
I can't.

784
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,250
留着它吧 孩子
Keep it, kid.

785
01:02:29,510 --> 01:02:30,930
那女孩是谁?
Who's the girl?

786
01:02:35,890 --> 01:02:37,850
我听说你可以把我送去外环
I was told you can get me to the Outer Rim.

787
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:39,020
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

788
01:02:40,770 --> 01:02:41,770
别这样丢下我
Don't leave without me.

789
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:47,440
你不能就这么走了 我不准
You can't just go. I won't let you.

790
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:48,610
我并不是你想象的那种人
I'm not who you think I am.

791
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:49,780
芬恩 你在说什么?
Finn, what are you talking about?

792
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:50,910
我不是抵抗军的一员
I'm not Resistance.

793
01:02:51,610 --> 01:02:53,120
我不是英雄
I'm not a hero.

794
01:02:56,370 --> 01:02:58,120
我只是个冲锋队员
I'm a stormtrooper.

795
01:02:59,290 --> 01:03:02,210
像他们所有人一样 我被从一个我永远不会知道的家庭中带走
Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know.

796
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:04,960
从小训练只为一个目的
And raised to do one thing.

797
01:03:05,670 --> 01:03:08,800
但在我第一次上战场时 我做了一个决定
But my first battle, I made a choice.

798
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,800
我不会为他们杀人
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

799
01:03:12,470 --> 01:03:15,390
所以我跑了 碰到了你
So I ran. Right into you.

800
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:19,060
从来没有人像你那样看着我
And you looked at me like no one ever had.

801
01:03:21,980 --> 01:03:24,270
我为我的身份感到羞耻
I was ashamed of what I was.

802
01:03:26,820 --> 01:03:28,820
但我受够了第一秩序
But I'm done with the First Order.

803
01:03:28,940 --> 01:03:30,740
我再也不想回到那里
I'm never going back.

804
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:34,570
蕾伊 跟我走吧
Rey, come with me.

805
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:36,910
你别走
Don't go.

806
01:03:42,080 --> 01:03:43,830
照顾好自己
Take care of yourself.

807
01:03:45,630 --> 01:03:47,300
拜托了
Please.

808
01:04:01,020 --> 01:04:03,100
不!
No!

809
01:04:03,190 --> 01:04:05,350
不!
No!

810
01:04:18,660 --> 01:04:21,540
不! 快回来!
No! Come back!

811
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,330
不!
No!

812
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:42,220
回来!
Come back!

813
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:54,400
不!
No!

814
01:05:45,370 --> 01:05:47,210
不!
No!

815
01:05:47,290 --> 01:05:48,830
它的能量...
Its energy...

816
01:05:52,630 --> 01:05:54,670
- 围绕着我们...  - 不!
- surrounds us...  - No!

817
01:05:54,800 --> 01:05:57,130
也蒙蔽了我们...
and binds us...

818
01:06:04,970 --> 01:06:06,100
原力会...
The Force will be...

819
01:06:15,150 --> 01:06:16,650
不!
No!

820
01:06:16,780 --> 01:06:18,650
回来!
Come back!

821
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:20,280
安静点 小女孩
Quiet, girl.

822
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:22,160
不!
No!

823
01:06:26,750 --> 01:06:27,750
蕾伊?
Rey?

824
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:35,050
这是你的第一步
These are your first steps.

825
01:06:40,010 --> 01:06:41,010
刚刚是什么?
What was that?

826
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:44,970
我不该进去的
I shouldn't have gone in there.

827
01:06:47,220 --> 01:06:49,690
那把光剑是卢克的
That lightsaber was Luke's.

828
01:06:49,770 --> 01:06:51,560
在那之前属于他的父亲
And his father's before him.

829
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:55,320
而现在 它在召唤你
And now, it calls to you.

830
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:56,860
我得回贾库去
I have to get back to Jakku.

831
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:59,200
汉告诉过我了
Han told me.

832
01:07:06,950 --> 01:07:09,000
亲爱的孩子
Dear child.

833
01:07:09,080 --> 01:07:11,120
我看到你的眼睛了
I see your eyes.

834
01:07:11,210 --> 01:07:14,210
你已经知道事实了
You already know the truth.

835
01:07:14,290 --> 01:07:16,750
不管你在贾库等的是谁...
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

836
01:07:18,050 --> 01:07:20,050
他们都不会回来了
they're never coming back.

837
01:07:26,100 --> 01:07:27,220
但...
But...

838
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,730
另一个人或许还能回来
there's someone who still could.

839
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:34,020
卢克
Luke.

840
01:07:34,100 --> 01:07:37,780
你所寻求的东西并不在过去...
The belonging you seek is not behind you...

841
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,570
它在未来
it is ahead.

842
01:07:39,690 --> 01:07:43,240
我不是绝地武士 但我了解原力
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

843
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:47,450
它在所有生物周围四处游走
It moves through and surrounds every living thing.

844
01:07:49,370 --> 01:07:50,960
闭上眼
Close your eyes.

845
01:07:53,250 --> 01:07:54,250
去感受
Feel it.

846
01:07:55,540 --> 01:07:57,630
那光明...
The light...

847
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:00,130
它一直在那里
it's always been there.

848
01:08:00,260 --> 01:08:02,260
会指引你
It will guide you.

849
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,430
那光剑 拿着它吧
The saber. Take it.

850
01:08:10,430 --> 01:08:12,390
我再也不会碰那东西了
I'm never touching that thing again.

851
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:13,980
我对这一切都不感兴趣
I don't want any part of this.

852

好好锁起来

882
01:11:58,950 --> 01:11:59,950
你从哪弄来的?

这是个好问题 但下次再说吧

但首先你要把你知道的一切都告诉我们

只是其中一小部分

995
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,630
我们手里的信息仍不足以...
We simply do not have enough information...

996
01:23:13,710 --> 01:23:15,210
定位卢克大师
to locate Master Luke.

997
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,300
我竟然真的蠢到以为自己能找到卢克...
Can't believe I was so foolish to think I could find Luke...

998
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:19,380
并把他带回家
and bring him home.

999
01:23:19,510 --> 01:23:20,630
莱娅
Leia.

1000
01:23:20,720 --> 01:23:21,800
别那么做
Don't do that.

1001
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:23,090
做什么?
Do what?

1002
01:23:23,180 --> 01:23:24,300
什么都别做
Anything.

1003
01:23:25,720 --> 01:23:27,600
公主呐
Princesses.

1004
01:23:27,720 --> 01:23:29,270
我只想帮上点忙
I'm trying to be helpful.

1005
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,520
你帮上过么?
When did that ever help?

1006
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,310
别提死星那档事儿
And don't say the Death Star.

1007
01:23:48,540 --> 01:23:49,540
BB-8呀
BB-8.

1008
01:23:49,660 --> 01:23:52,710
你在白费力气
You're wasting your time.

1009
01:23:52,790 --> 01:23:54,540
R2的备份数据库里不大可能有
It is very doubtful that R2 would have

1010
01:23:54,710 --> 01:23:55,880
地图的另一部分
the rest of the map in his backup data.

1011
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,170
恐怕不会的
I am afraid not.

1012
01:23:58,250 --> 01:24:02,300
R2-D2自从卢克大师走了以后就一直处于低电状态
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode ever since Master Luke went away.

1013
01:24:04,890 --> 01:24:08,140
很遗憾 他可能再也不会是从前的他了
Sadly, he may never be his old self again.

1014
01:24:09,850 --> 01:24:11,480
听我说 好么?
Listen to me, will you?

1015
01:24:12,480 --> 01:24:14,810
我知道每次你...
I know every time you...

1016
01:24:17,020 --> 01:24:19,400
每次你看着我的时候都会想起他
Every time you look at me you're reminded of him.

1017
01:24:19,480 --> 01:24:21,490
你觉得我想忘记他?
You think I want to forget him?

1018
01:24:21,570 --> 01:24:23,240
我希望他能回来
I want him back.

1019
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:25,450
我们尽力了
There's nothing more we could have done.

1020
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,580
他太像维达了
There's too much Vader in him.

1021
01:24:28,660 --> 01:24:31,580
所以我才让他和卢克一起训练
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke.

1022
01:24:31,660 --> 01:24:33,370
我不该把他送走的
I just never should have sent him away.

1023
01:24:33,460 --> 01:24:35,040
送走他的那一刻 我就失去他了
That's when I lost him.

1024
01:24:36,290 --> 01:24:38,290
也一样失去了你
That's when I lost you both.

1025
01:24:40,380 --> 01:24:43,050
我们都只会用自己的方法来应对
We both had to deal with it in our own way.

1026
01:24:44,050 --> 01:24:47,010
我做回了老行当 只有这件事是我擅长的
I went back to the only thing I was ever any good at.

1027
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:48,810
我们都一样
We both did.

1028
01:24:51,020 --> 01:24:52,770
我们失去了我们的儿子
We lost our son.

1029
01:24:52,850 --> 01:24:54,020
永远地失去了
Forever.

1030
01:24:54,100 --> 01:24:55,100
不
No.

1031
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:56,770
是斯诺克
It was Snoke.

1032
01:24:57,230 --> 01:24:59,860
是他诱惑我们的儿子去了黑暗面
He seduced our son to the dark side.

1033
01:24:59,940 --> 01:25:01,530
但是我们仍然可以拯救他
But we can still save him.

1034
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,360
我
Me.

1035
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:05,320
你
You.

1036
01:25:06,160 --> 01:25:08,490
连卢克都改变不了他 我又能怎么办?
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

1037
01:25:08,580 --> 01:25:09,990
卢克是绝地武士
Luke is a Jedi.

1038
01:25:11,580 --> 01:25:12,910
可你是他的父亲
You're his father.

1039
01:25:15,620 --> 01:25:19,420
他心里还有光明 我知道的
There is still light in him, I know it.

1040
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:21,210
将军...
General...

1041
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,800
敌方基地的侦查报告已经完成
the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.

1042
01:25:50,620 --> 01:25:51,620
我在哪?
Where am I?

1043
01:25:53,950 --> 01:25:55,290
你是我的客人
You're my guest.

1044
01:25:55,370 --> 01:25:56,710
其他人呢?
Where are the others?

1045
01:25:56,790 --> 01:25:58,460
你说是那些被你叫做朋友的...
Do you mean the murderers...

1046
01:25:58,540 --> 01:26:01,420
谋杀犯 叛徒和小偷?
traitors, and thieves you call friends?

1047
01:26:02,380 --> 01:26:04,840
我不知道 你可以松口气了
You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea.

1048
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,930
你还是想杀我
You still want to kill me.

1049
01:26:09,720 --> 01:26:11,390
你倒是试试被一个带面具的怪物...
That happens when you're being hunted...

1050
01:26:11,470 --> 01:26:13,390
追杀的滋味
by a creature in a mask.

1051
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:40,170
告诉我机器人的事
Tell me about the droid.

1052
01:26:41,000 --> 01:26:42,840
它是个BB型号的机器人 装有硒驱动器...
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive...

1053
01:26:42,920 --> 01:26:44,250
和热扫描分辨器
and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

1054
01:26:44,340 --> 01:26:46,460
它带着一张导航地图的碎片
It's carrying a section of a navigational chart.

1055
01:26:46,550 --> 01:26:47,920
我们有其余部分
And we have the rest.

1056
01:26:48,010 --> 01:26:49,800
从帝国的档案中还原出来的...
Recovered from the archives of the Empire...

1057
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:50,970
但是我们需要这最后一部分
but we need the last piece.

1058
01:26:51,050 --> 01:26:53,510
而不知为何 你竟然说服机器人给你看了
And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you.

1059
01:26:55,140 --> 01:26:56,140
你
You.

1060
01:26:57,600 --> 01:26:58,850
一个捡破烂的人
A scavenger.

1061
01:27:01,190 --> 01:27:03,310
要知道没什么东西是我弄不到的
You know I can take whatever I want.

1062
01:27:09,450 --> 01:27:11,360
你很孤独
You're so lonely.

1063
01:27:13,370 --> 01:27:14,870
不愿离开家乡
So afraid to leave.

1064
01:27:19,040 --> 01:27:21,960
在夜里 怎么都睡不着
At night, desperate to sleep.

1065
01:27:25,090 --> 01:27:26,670
你想象过一片大海
You imagine an ocean.

1066
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:28,920
我看见了
I see it.

1067
01:27:30,170 --> 01:27:31,930
我看见了岛屿
I see the island.

1068
01:27:36,510 --> 01:27:37,810
还有汉·索罗
And Han Solo.

1069
01:27:40,140 --> 01:27:42,310
他让你尝到了从未有过的父爱的感觉
You feel like he's the father you never had.

1070
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:44,440
他会让你失望的
He would have disappointed you.

1071
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:45,860
滚出我的脑袋
Get out of my head.

1072
01:27:46,980 --> 01:27:48,530
我知道你看过地图
I know you've seen the map.

1073
01:27:50,110 --> 01:27:51,280
就在你的记忆里
It's in there.

1074
01:27:52,200 --> 01:27:53,450
现在你会把它交给我
And now you'll give it to me.

1075
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:04,130
别害怕 我能感觉到你的恐惧
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

1076
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:09,090
我什么都不会给你的
I'm not giving you anything.

1077
01:28:09,710 --> 01:28:10,800
我们走着瞧
We'll see.

1078
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:51,800
你
You.

1079
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:53,880
你害怕了
You're afraid.

1080
01:28:56,930 --> 01:28:59,850
你怕你永远都无法像达斯·维达那样强大
That you will never be as strong as Darth Vader.

1081
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:10,860
那个捡破烂的...
The scavenger...

1082
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,610
反抗了你?
resisted you?

1083
01:29:12,690 --> 01:29:14,280
她的原力很强
She is strong with the Force.

1084
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:16,160
未经训练 但潜力超乎想象
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1085
01:29:16,240 --> 01:29:17,450
机器人呢?
And the droid?

1086
01:29:17,530 --> 01:29:20,870
伦觉得它对我们已经没有价值了
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us.

1087
01:29:20,950 --> 01:29:23,580
我们只需要那个女孩
That the girl was all we needed.

1088
01:29:23,700 --> 01:29:26,170
所以 那个机器人估计已经回到了...
As a result, the droid has most likely been returned...

1089
01:29:26,250 --> 01:29:27,380
我们敌人的手里
to the hands of the enemy.

1090
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:29,210
他们可能已经拥有了地图
They may have the map already.

1091
01:29:29,290 --> 01:29:30,920
那么我们必须在他们找到天行者前...
Then the Resistance must be destroyed...

1092
01:29:31,050 --> 01:29:33,050
将他们消灭
before they get to Skywalker.

1093
01:29:33,130 --> 01:29:35,010
我们有他们的位置
We have their location.

1094
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:37,720
我们追踪他们的侦查飞船到了伊利尼姆星系
We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system.

1095
01:29:38,720 --> 01:29:40,010
太好了
Good.

1096
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:42,970
这样我们就可以将他们一网打尽
Then we will crush them once and for all.

1097
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:44,810
准备武器
Prepare the weapon.

1098
01:29:45,430 --> 01:29:48,230
最高领袖 我能从那个女孩身上得到地图
Supreme Leader, I can get the map from the girl.

1099
01:29:48,310 --> 01:29:50,110
我只是需要你的指导
I just need your guidance.

1100
01:29:51,730 --> 01:29:55,820
如果那个女孩真的如你所说...
If what you say about this girl is true...

1101
01:29:56,450 --> 01:30:01,120
带她来见我
Bring her to me.

1102
01:30:15,090 --> 01:30:17,260
你会解开这些锁扣...
You will remove these restraints...

1103
01:30:17,340 --> 01:30:20,430
把牢门打开 离开这里
and leave this cell with the door open.

1104
01:30:24,180 --> 01:30:25,930
你说什么?
What did you say?

1105
01:30:28,850 --> 01:30:30,350
你会解开这些锁扣...
You will remove these restraints...

1106
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:33,110
把牢门打开 离开这里
and leave this cell with the door open.

1107
01:30:39,950 --> 01:30:41,490
我会把它们系紧一点...
I'll tighten those restraints...

1108
01:30:41,620 --> 01:30:43,660
该死的捡破烂的
scavenger scum.

1109
01:30:57,970 --> 01:30:59,550
你会解开这些锁扣...
You will remove these restraints...

1110
01:30:59,630 --> 01:31:02,010
把牢门打开 离开这里
and leave this cell with the door open.

1111
01:31:05,720 --> 01:31:07,310
我会解开这些锁扣...
I will remove these restraints...

1112
01:31:07,390 --> 01:31:09,140
把牢门打开 离开这里
and leave the cell with the door open.

1113
01:31:18,070 --> 01:31:21,110
- 然后你会扔下武器  - 然后我会扔下武器
- And you'll drop your weapon.  - And I'll drop my weapon.

1114
01:31:33,830 --> 01:31:34,920
不
No.

1115
01:31:35,920 --> 01:31:36,920
不
No.

1116
01:31:38,840 --> 01:31:39,970
看守!
Guards!

1117
01:31:42,510 --> 01:31:43,510
看守!
Guards!

1118
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:50,770
准备武器充能
Begin charging the weapon.

1119
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:52,190
是的 长官
Yes, sir.

1120
01:31:52,270 --> 01:31:53,560
武器充能中
Weapon charging.

1121
01:32:12,830 --> 01:32:14,830
斯奈普通过侦查飞船扫描到的结果...
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance flight...

1122
01:32:14,920 --> 01:32:16,250
证实了芬恩的报告
confirms Finn's report.

1123
01:32:16,380 --> 01:32:18,340
他们似乎在行星内部建造了一个...
They've somehow created a hyper-lightspeed weapon...

1124
01:32:18,420 --> 01:32:19,710
超光速武器
built within the planet itself.

1125
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:20,880
一个激光加农炮?
A laser cannon?

1126
01:32:20,920 --> 01:32:22,760
武器的规模远超我们现有的描述能力
We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.

1127
01:32:22,880 --> 01:32:23,880
那就是一颗死星
It's another Death Star.

1128
01:32:23,970 --> 01:32:25,720
我也希望是这样 长官
I wish that were the case, Major.

1129
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:27,050
这是曾经的死星
This was the Death Star.

1130
01:32:29,810 --> 01:32:32,310
这是弑星者基地
And this is Starkiller Base.

1131
01:32:32,810 --> 01:32:33,980
所以 它很大
So, it's big.

1132
01:32:34,060 --> 01:32:37,150
这么大的武器能量从哪里来呢?
How is it possible to power a weapon of that size?

1133
01:32:37,270 --> 01:32:39,400
它使用恒星的能量
It uses the power of the sun.

1134
01:32:40,610 --> 01:32:41,780
武器充能时...
As the weapon is charged...

1135
01:32:41,900 --> 01:32:43,990
恒星会不断消耗直至枯竭
the sun is drained until it disappears.

1136
01:32:44,070 --> 01:32:45,070
夫人
Ma'am.

1137
01:32:47,070 --> 01:32:48,120
第一秩序...
The First Order...

1138
01:32:48,240 --> 01:32:49,760
他们又开始为武器充能了
they're charging the weapon again now.

1139
01:32:50,620 --> 01:32:52,500
我们的星系是下一个目标
Our system is the next target.

1140
01:32:52,620 --> 01:32:53,620
哦 天哪
Oh, my.

1141
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:55,210
没有新共和国舰队的帮助 我们就完了
Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed.

1142
01:32:55,290 --> 01:32:57,080
好 要怎么才能炸掉它?
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1143
01:32:57,170 --> 01:32:59,500
- 总有办法能炸掉它的  - 汉说得对
- There's always a way to do that.  - Han's right.

1144
01:32:59,590 --> 01:33:01,260
要想承载...
In order for that amount of power...

1145
01:33:01,340 --> 01:33:02,720
这种量级的能量...
to be contained...

1146
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:04,760
基地肯定装有某种热振荡器
that base has to have some kind of thermal oscillator.

1147
01:33:04,880 --> 01:33:07,050
有一个 在第47区域
There is one. Precinct 47.

1148
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:08,890
在这里
Here.

1149
01:33:08,970 --> 01:33:10,930
如果我们能摧毁这个振荡器
If we can destroy that oscillator...

1150
01:33:11,060 --> 01:33:14,020
就能扰乱能源核心 进而削弱武器力量
it might destabilize the core and cripple the weapon.

1151
01:33:14,100 --> 01:33:15,900
- 甚至能摧毁星球  - 我们飞去那里
- Maybe the planet.  - We'll go in there,

1152
01:33:15,980 --> 01:33:17,310
倾尽所有弹药 朝振荡器开火
we'll hit that oscillator with everything we've got.

1153
01:33:17,440 --> 01:33:18,770
他们装有护盾
They have defensive shields...

1154
01:33:18,860 --> 01:33:20,820
我们的战舰穿不过去
that our ships cannot penetrate.

1155
01:33:20,940 --> 01:33:22,360
那就把护盾破坏掉
We disable the shields.

1156
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:24,110
孩子 你在那工作过
Kid, you worked there.

1157
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:25,240
你了解些什么吗?
What do you got?

1158
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:26,530
这事我能干
I can do it.

1159
01:33:26,610 --> 01:33:27,870
我太喜欢你了
I like this guy.

1160
01:33:27,990 --> 01:33:29,870
我可以破坏护盾 但必须在现场操作
I can disable the shields, but I have to be there.

1161
01:33:29,950 --> 01:33:31,410
我得到星球上去
On the planet.

1162
01:33:31,490 --> 01:33:33,120
- 我们送你去  - 汉 你要怎么做?
- We'll get you there.  - Han, how?

1163
01:33:33,870 --> 01:33:35,370
我要是说出来 你又得发火
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1164
01:33:35,500 --> 01:33:37,370
所以 我们关掉护盾...
So we disable the shields...

1165
01:33:37,460 --> 01:33:39,750
拿下振荡器 然后炸掉大炮
we take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun.

1166
01:33:41,080 --> 01:33:41,960
好了 走吧
All right. Let's go.

1167
01:34:04,490 --> 01:34:05,990
楚伊 检查一下散热器
Chewie, check that thermal capitator.

1168
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:07,570
来吧 走了
Come on. Let's go.

1169
01:34:07,660 --> 01:34:09,870
芬恩 小心点那东西 那可是炸弹
Finn, be careful with those. They're explosives.

1170
01:34:09,990 --> 01:34:11,030
你现在才说?
Now you tell me?

1171
01:34:11,160 --> 01:34:14,370
你知道吗 不管我们怎么吵架...
You know, no matter how much we fought...

1172
01:34:15,790 --> 01:34:18,120
我还是不喜欢看你离开
I've always hated watching you leave.

1173
01:34:18,210 --> 01:34:19,420
所以我才这么做啊
That's why I did it.

1174
01:34:20,670 --> 01:34:22,170
这样你就会想我
So you'd miss me.

1175
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,720
我确实想你
I did miss you.

1176
01:34:28,180 --> 01:34:29,970
过去的日子也不算很差劲吧?
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1177
01:34:30,050 --> 01:34:31,140
是吧?
Huh?

1178
01:34:31,220 --> 01:34:34,350
有一些算是... 挺好的
Some of it was... good.

1179
01:34:34,520 --> 01:34:36,180
非常好
Pretty good.

1180
01:34:39,520 --> 01:34:42,400
- 有些事情是不会变的  - 是啊
- Some things never change.  - True.

1181
01:34:42,940 --> 01:34:44,940
你依然让我抓狂
You still drive me crazy.

1182
01:34:54,120 --> 01:34:56,040
如果你见到我们儿子...
If you see our son...

1183
01:34:58,540 --> 01:35:00,210
把他带回家
bring him home.

1184
01:35:05,630 --> 01:35:08,300
长官 718号机库的感应器被触发了
Sir, sensors triggered in Hangar 7 18.

1185
01:35:08,380 --> 01:35:10,050
我们正在搜索这片区域
We're searching the area.

1186
01:35:10,130 --> 01:35:12,260
她才刚开始尝试自己的能力
She's just beginning to test her powers.

1187
01:35:12,390 --> 01:35:14,050
越晚找到她...
The longer it takes to find her...

1188
01:35:14,140 --> 01:35:15,810
她就越危险
the more dangerous she becomes.

1189
01:35:20,900 --> 01:35:22,520
所有的哨兵机器人请注意...
All sentry droids...

1190
01:35:22,610 --> 01:35:23,810
所有的哨兵机器人请注意...
all sentry droids...

1191
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:26,150
重新同步到银河系标准时间
resynchronize to Galactic Standard Time.

1192
01:35:26,230 --> 01:35:28,240
补偿值为473
Offset 473.

1193
01:35:30,990 --> 01:35:32,070
我们要怎么进去?
How are we getting in?

1194
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:34,160
他们的保护罩刷新率极小
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate.

1195
01:35:34,240 --> 01:35:35,910
能阻止所有慢于光速的
Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed

1196
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,410
飞行器通过
from getting through.

1197
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:40,080
我们要以光速着陆吗?
We're making our landing approach at lightspeed?

1198
01:35:41,540 --> 01:35:42,630
楚伊 做好准备
Chewie, get ready.

1199
01:35:43,920 --> 01:35:45,090
就是现在!
And... Now!

1200
01:35:49,010 --> 01:35:50,670
我已经在提升高度了!
I am pulling up!

1201
01:35:57,390 --> 01:35:59,020
再高一点...
I get any higher...

1202
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,350
他们就该看到我们了!
they'll see us!

1203
01:36:22,290 --> 01:36:24,670
长官 她不在718号机库
Sir, she was not found in Hangar 718.

1204
01:36:24,790 --> 01:36:25,910
但部队已经全面戒备
But all troops are on alert.

1205
01:36:25,960 --> 01:36:27,340
锁定所有的机库
Put every hangar on lockdown.

1206
01:36:27,460 --> 01:36:29,180
她肯定打算偷一架战机逃跑...
She's going to try to steal a ship to esc...

1207
01:36:31,760 --> 01:36:33,300
汉·索罗
Han Solo.

1208
01:36:44,520 --> 01:36:46,230
翻过山脊就是泄洪道了
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1209
01:36:46,310 --> 01:36:47,560
我们从那边进去
We'll get in that way.

1210
01:36:47,650 --> 01:36:49,570
你在基地里的工作是什么?
What was your job when you were based here?

1211
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:50,650
清洁工
Sanitation.

1212
01:36:53,530 --> 01:36:55,240
清洁工?
Sanitation?

1213
01:36:55,320 --> 01:36:57,030
那你怎么知道如何关掉护盾的?
Then how do you know how to disable the shields?

1214
01:36:57,160 --> 01:36:58,160
我不知道
I don't.

1215
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:00,040
我是来这救蕾伊的
I'm just here to get Rey.

1216
01:37:00,160 --> 01:37:03,750
大伙儿指望着我们 银河系也指望着我们呐
People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us.

1217
01:37:03,830 --> 01:37:05,170
索罗 我们会想出办法的
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1218
01:37:06,130 --> 01:37:07,540
我们可以使用原力
We'll use the Force.

1219
01:37:07,670 --> 01:37:09,750
原力不是这么用的
That's not how the Force works.

1220
01:37:11,340 --> 01:37:13,880
真的吗? 你还冷啊?
Oh, really? You're cold?

1221
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:15,050
走吧
Come on.

1222
01:37:22,470 --> 01:37:23,770
报告
Report.

1223
01:37:23,850 --> 01:37:26,060
武器十五分钟后充能完毕 长官
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1224
01:37:28,520 --> 01:37:29,520
嘿!
Hey!

1225
01:37:32,690 --> 01:37:34,900
我们待的时间越长 成功的可能性就越小
The longer we're here the less luck we're gonna have.

1226
01:37:35,030 --> 01:37:37,530
- 护盾  - 我有个想法
- The shields.  - I have an idea about that.

1227
01:37:45,500 --> 01:37:47,960
- 还记得我吗?  - FN-2187
- You remember me?  - FN-2187.

1228
01:37:48,040 --> 01:37:49,290
现在不是了
Not anymore.

1229
01:37:49,460 --> 01:37:50,820
我现在叫芬恩 现在由我做主了
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1230
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:52,920
现在由我做主了 法斯玛 由我做主
I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.

1231
01:37:53,010 --> 01:37:55,010
- 冷静点 冷静点  - 好
- Bring it down. Bring it down.  - Yeah.

1232
01:37:55,090 --> 01:37:56,220
跟我走
Follow me.

1233
01:38:09,400 --> 01:38:10,860
你看过最新型的T-17战机了吗?
Have you checked out the new T-17s?

1234
01:38:10,940 --> 01:38:12,610
T-17 就我看来...
The T-17s, as far as I can tell...

1235
01:38:12,730 --> 01:38:13,780
有了很大的进步
are a great improvement.

1236
01:38:13,900 --> 01:38:15,740
对 他们就是这么说的
Yeah. That's what they tell you.

1237
01:38:15,860 --> 01:38:17,070
但是信我吧 它们撑不了多久
But believe me, they don't hold up.

1238
01:38:17,200 --> 01:38:18,700
- 撑不了多久?  - 对
- They don't?  - No.

1239
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:56,150
你想我把你头上那个铁桶轰下来吗?
You want me to blast that bucket off your head?

1240
01:38:56,240 --> 01:38:57,360
关掉护盾
Lower the shields.

1241
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,280
你这是大错特错
You're making a big mistake.

1242
01:38:59,410 --> 01:39:01,490
照做
Do it.

1243
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:06,870
索罗 如果这法子奏效...
Solo, if this works...

1244
01:39:06,950 --> 01:39:09,210
我们就没多少时间去找蕾伊了
we're not gonna have a lot of time to find Rey.

1245
01:39:09,290 --> 01:39:10,670
别担心 孩子
Don't worry, kid.

1246
01:39:11,460 --> 01:39:12,880
没找到她我们是不会走的
We won't leave here without her.

1247
01:39:14,670 --> 01:39:17,550
你不会蠢到相信这事会这么容易吧
You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy.

1248
01:39:17,630 --> 01:39:20,220
我的部队会立刻赶来杀掉你们
My troops will storm this block and kill you all.

1249
01:39:20,300 --> 01:39:22,140
我不同意 我们怎么处理她?
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1250
01:39:22,760 --> 01:39:24,300
这里有垃圾倾倒槽吗?
Is there a garbage chute?

1251
01:39:24,970 --> 01:39:26,310
废物压缩机呢?
Trash compactor?

1252
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:28,560
有的
Yeah, there is.

1253
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:30,440
将军 护盾失效了
General, their shields are down.

1254
01:39:30,520 --> 01:39:32,100
感谢造物主!
Thank the Maker!

1255
01:39:32,190 --> 01:39:33,940
汉做到了 派他们进去
Han did it. Send them in.

1256
01:39:34,020 --> 01:39:35,940
由波全权负责进攻
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1257
01:39:36,020 --> 01:39:38,320
黑队小组长 随时降到亚光速
Black Leader, go to sub-lights on your call.

1258
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:39,400
收到 基地
Roger, base.

1259
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:41,200
红队 蓝队 听我指令
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1260
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:43,410
减速至光速以下
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1261
01:39:57,170 --> 01:39:58,670
快到射程内了
Almost in range.

1262
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:01,590
瞄准目标射击 不行就多来几轮
Hit the target dead center. As many runs as we can get.

1263
01:40:01,680 --> 01:40:03,550
接近目标
Approaching target.

1264
01:40:07,510 --> 01:40:08,970
敌机来袭!
Fighters incoming!

1265
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:11,440
方向是28.336
Coming at 28.336.

1266
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:13,310
45! 开启护盾! 开启护盾!
Forty-five! Shields up! Shields up!

1267
01:40:13,400 --> 01:40:15,060
派出所有中队
Dispatch all squadrons.

1268
01:40:15,190 --> 01:40:16,690
好的 将军
Yes, General.

1269
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:18,680
好了 把它点燃吧
All right. Let's light it up.

1270
01:40:28,290 --> 01:40:30,370
- 直接命中  - 但没能破坏它!
- Ah, direct hit.  - But no damage!

1271
01:40:30,450 --> 01:40:31,710
我们得持续攻击
Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it.

1272
01:40:31,870 --> 01:40:33,170
再来一轮轰炸
Another bombing run.

1273
01:40:33,290 --> 01:40:36,000
记住 太阳消失时他们的武器就充能完毕了
Remember, when the sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire.

1274
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,670
但只要还有一丝光线 我们就有机会
But as long as there's light, we got a chance.

1275
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:41,920
伙计们 大量敌机来袭!
Guys, we got a lot of company!

1276
01:40:48,560 --> 01:40:50,180
我猜他们会分头行动
We think they may be splitting up.

1277
01:40:50,270 --> 01:40:52,230
前往4区和5区
Heading to quadrants 4 and 5.

1278
01:41:00,070 --> 01:41:02,070
我们可以用炸弹把防爆门炸了
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door.

1279
01:41:02,150 --> 01:41:04,910
我进去吸引火力 但我需要你的掩护
I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover.

1280
01:41:04,990 --> 01:41:06,110
你确定你要这么做吗?
You sure you're up for this?

1281
01:41:06,160 --> 01:41:07,370
当然不确定
Hell, no.

1282
01:41:07,450 --> 01:41:08,740
我进去找蕾伊
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

1283
01:41:08,830 --> 01:41:10,040
后面肯定有部队跟过来
The troopers will be on our tail.

1284
01:41:10,120 --> 01:41:12,250
我们得做好准备
We have to be ready for that.

1285
01:41:12,330 --> 01:41:14,120
那边有一条隧道可以通往...
There's an access tunnel that leads...

1286
01:41:14,210 --> 01:41:16,750
你这是干什么? 嗯? 干嘛做这种动作?
Why are you doing that? Hmm? Why are you doing this?

1287
01:41:16,830 --> 01:41:18,190
我在做计划呢
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1288
01:41:34,890 --> 01:41:36,480
你还好吧?
You all right?

1289
01:41:36,560 --> 01:41:38,190
- 还好  - 那就好
- Yeah.  - Good.

1290
01:41:38,270 --> 01:41:39,860
你怎么样了? 他伤到你了吗?
What happened to you? Did he hurt you?

1291
01:41:39,940 --> 01:41:41,320
芬恩 你来这干什么?
Finn, what are you doing here?

1292
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,530
我们是来救你的
We came back for you.

1293
01:41:44,400 --> 01:41:45,950
他说什么?
What'd he say?

1294
01:41:46,030 --> 01:41:47,410
他说这都是你的主意
That it was your idea.

1295
01:41:51,200 --> 01:41:52,290
谢谢
Thank you.

1296
01:41:56,160 --> 01:41:57,750
你是怎么跑出来的?
How did you get away?

1297
01:41:57,830 --> 01:41:58,880
我没法解释
I can't explain it.

1298
01:41:58,960 --> 01:42:01,040
你也不会相信的
And you wouldn't believe it.

1299
01:42:01,130 --> 01:42:03,460
快跑吧 待会儿再抱
Escape now, hug later.

1300
01:42:18,650 --> 01:42:20,190
我后面跟了一架敌机
I got one behind me.

1301
01:42:20,310 --> 01:42:21,690
- 你看到了吗?  - 看到了 我这就去干掉它
- You see it?  - Yeah. I'm on it.

1302
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,280
- 布瑞罗被击中了  - 小心地面火力
- Burillo's been hit.  - Watch out for ground fire.

1303
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:39,040
他们有麻烦了
They're in trouble.

1304
01:42:39,120 --> 01:42:40,540
我们不能走
We can't leave.

1305
01:42:42,340 --> 01:42:45,340
我的朋友带着一整包炸弹呢
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

1306
01:42:45,420 --> 01:42:47,090
用了吧
Let's use them.

1307
01:42:47,170 --> 01:42:48,550
将军 你看到了吗?
General, are you seeing this?

1308
01:42:48,680 --> 01:42:50,010
又有两架X翼战机被击落了
Two more X-wings down.

1309
01:42:50,090 --> 01:42:52,470
我们舰队的一半战机都被摧毁了
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1310
01:42:52,550 --> 01:42:55,220
他们的武器还有十分钟就要充能完毕了
And their weapon will be fully charged in ten minutes.

1311
01:42:55,310 --> 01:42:57,430
现在除非奇迹发生我们才能得救
It would take a miracle to save us now.

1312
01:43:23,880 --> 01:43:24,880
啊
Ah.

1313
01:43:24,960 --> 01:43:27,300
小姑娘有一套啊
Girl knows her stuff.

1314
01:43:36,260 --> 01:43:38,730
隔一根柱子放一颗炸弹
We'll set the charges against every other column.

1315
01:43:39,940 --> 01:43:41,900
说得对 这主意更好
You're right. That's a better idea.

1316
01:43:41,980 --> 01:43:43,980
你负责上面 我负责下面
You take the top. I'll go down below.

1317
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:45,730
引爆装置
Detonator.

1318
01:43:45,820 --> 01:43:47,480
待会儿在这里碰面
We'll meet back here.

1319
01:44:32,900 --> 01:44:33,910
去找他们
Find them.

1320
01:45:35,680 --> 01:45:36,680
本!
Ben!

1321
01:45:49,440 --> 01:45:50,570
汉·索罗
Han Solo.

1322
01:45:51,270 --> 01:45:54,150
我等这一天已经很久了
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

1323
01:46:13,420 --> 01:46:16,930
摘掉面具 你并不需要它
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1324
01:46:17,510 --> 01:46:19,390
我摘下面具 你以为你会看到什么?
What do you think you'll see if I do?

1325
01:46:19,510 --> 01:46:21,760
我儿子的脸
The face of my son.

1326
01:46:43,620 --> 01:46:45,790
你的儿子已经死了
Your son is gone.

1327
01:46:47,080 --> 01:46:49,420
他跟他父亲一样 又弱又蠢
He was weak and foolish like his father.

1328
01:46:49,580 --> 01:46:51,330
所以我毁了他
So I destroyed him.

1329
01:46:53,420 --> 01:46:55,800
这是斯诺克想让你相信的事情
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.

1330
01:46:57,050 --> 01:46:58,760
但事实并非如此
But it's not true.

1331
01:47:00,090 --> 01:47:02,180
我的儿子还活着
My son is alive.

1332
01:47:02,260 --> 01:47:03,720
不
No.

1333
01:47:03,810 --> 01:47:06,020
最高领袖是明智的
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1334
01:47:06,100 --> 01:47:08,850
斯诺克只是在利用你的力量
Snoke is using you for your power.

1335
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:10,730
一旦目的达成 他就会杀了你
When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you.

1336
01:47:15,980 --> 01:47:17,650
你知道的
You know it's true.

1337
01:47:23,280 --> 01:47:24,280
太晚了
It's too late.

1338
01:47:24,370 --> 01:47:25,950
不 并不晚
No, it's not.

1339
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,790
跟我离开这里 回家吧
Leave here with me. Come home.

1340
01:47:29,540 --> 01:47:30,960
我们很想你
We miss you.

1341
01:47:39,670 --> 01:47:41,800
我快被撕裂了
I'm being torn apart.

1342
01:47:44,640 --> 01:47:46,810
我想摆脱这种痛苦
I want to be free of this pain.

1343
01:47:52,230 --> 01:47:53,310
我知道我得做什么...
I know what I have to do...

1344
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,480
但我不知道自己是否有能力做到
but I don't know if I have the strength to do it.

1345
01:47:59,400 --> 01:48:00,490
你会帮我吗?
Will you help me?

1346
01:48:00,570 --> 01:48:02,410
会 不论何事
Yes. Anything.

1347
01:48:50,700 --> 01:48:53,540

谢谢
Thank you.

1349
01:49:09,220 --> 01:49:10,220
不
No.

1350
01:50:25,550 --> 01:50:27,130
振荡器已经损坏...
The oscillator's been damaged...

1351
01:50:27,220 --> 01:50:28,970
但还未彻底失效
but is still functional.

1352
01:50:29,050 --> 01:50:31,550
司令 他们的武器还有两分钟就要开火了
Admiral, their weapon will fire in two minutes.

1353
01:50:42,820 --> 01:50:44,280
千年隼在这边
The Falcon's this way.

1354
01:51:05,170 --> 01:51:06,510
我们还没了结呢
We're not done yet.

1355
01:51:09,680 --> 01:51:11,510
你是一个怪物
You're a monster.

1356
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:13,510
现在只有我们了
It's just us now.

1357
01:51:14,680 --> 01:51:16,180
汉·索罗救不了你们了
Han Solo can't save you.

1358
01:51:24,980 --> 01:51:26,780
蕾伊!

1359
01:51:29,570 --> 01:51:31,070
蕾伊

1360
01:51:31,160 --> 01:51:32,160
蕾伊!

1361
01:51:33,990 --> 01:51:35,620

01:51:35,700 --> 01:51:36,700
蕾伊
Rey.

1363
01:51:38,910 --> 01:51:40,460

1364
01:51:51,010 --> 01:51:52,550

是我的
It belongs to me.

01:51:54,800 --> 01:51:56,470
有本事来拿啊
Come get it.

1367
01:53:44,290 --> 01:53:45,370
红队一号被击中了
We just lost R-1.

1368
01:53:46,000 --> 01:53:47,290
我们要撑不住了
We're overwhelmed.

1369
01:53:47,380 --> 01:53:48,670
我们该怎么办 这样下去是不行的
What do we do? It isn't working.

1370
01:53:49,420 --> 01:53:51,700

1385
01:56:16,770 --> 01:56:18,570
我可以教你使用原力
I could show you the ways of the Force.

1386
01:56:21,200 --> 01:56:22,280
原力?

1387
01:58:11,060 --> 01:58:12,470
盯紧那架TIE型战机
All eyes on that TIE fighter.

1388
