17
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,340
身材矮小的野蛮拾荒者

18
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:49,100
你又犯了一个错误 索洛 你就是想赖账

19
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:01,600
两次

20
00:45:09,970 --> 00:45:11,730
你也无处可躲

21
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,200
- 搜查这艘运输舰 - 明白

22
00:58:29,500 --> 00:58:31,660
发现抵抗者

23
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,000
你们要找的机器人也在这

24
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:43,580
通知第一秩序 我找到机器人了

25
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,570
很久很久以前 在一个遥远的银河系....

26
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,470
卢克・天行者不知所踪

27
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:40,230
在他消失数年中

28
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,980
邪恶的第一秩序...

29
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,930
从帝国的灰烬中悄然崛起

30
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,220
在除掉最后一个绝地武士 天行者之前

31
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,920
第一秩序绝不卸甲休兵

32
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,570
在共和国的鼎力支持下

33
00:00:54,590 --> 00:00:56,330
莱娅・奥加纳将军

34
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,030
领导着一个勇敢的抵抗组织

35
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:00,620
她急需想要找到哥哥卢克

36
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:02,250
从而在他的帮助下

37
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,860
恢复银河系的和平与正义

38
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:10,440
莱娅已派出最英勇的飞行员

39
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:13,910
前往贾库星球执行秘密任务

40
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:16,800
一位昔日的盟友在那里发现了

41
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:20,760
有关卢克下落的重要线索....

42
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,840
这个东西会让一切步入正轨的
This will begin to make things right.

43
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,750
我已游历各处 阅尽沧桑
I've traveled too far and seen too much

44
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,810
以致忽略了弥漫在银河系中的绝望
to ignore the despair in the galaxy.

45
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:09,770
没有了绝地 原力绝无平衡的可能
Without the Jedi, there can be no balance in the Force.

46
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,150
正是因为你 如今我们才拥有了一个机会
Well, because of you, now we have a chance.

47
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,020
将军已经追查此事许久了
The General's been after this for a long time.

48
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,890
将军
Oh, the General?

49
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,360
对我来说她可是皇室
To me, she is royalty.

50
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:21,350
她当然是了
Well, she certainly is that.

51
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,370
有人来了
We got company.

52
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,970
你得藏起来
You have to hide.

53
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,510
你得离开
You have to leave.

54
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:47,640
快走
Go.

55
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,540
全体出发 冲啊
Get out! Go! Go! Go!

56
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:21,340
快来 BB-8 动作快点
Come on, BB-8, hurry!

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,710
炸掉那架X翼战机
Blast that X-wing!

58
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:35,980
开火 后方有敌人来了
Over there! Over there!

59
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:43,110
我看到了
I see them.

60
00:05:14,730 --> 00:05:15,670
你帮我拿着
You take this.

61
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,730
它在你身上会更安全
It's safer with you than it is with me.

62
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,690
赶快离开这里 越远越好
You get as far away from here as you can.

63
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,570
- 听明白了吗 - 我不知道...
Do you hear me?

64
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,070
我会回来找你的
I'll come back for you.

65
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,120
我们都会没事的
It will be all right.

66
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,470
继续前进
Keep moving!

67
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:30,970
守在这里
Stay here.

68
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:57,250
瞧瞧你都老成什么样了
Look how old you've become.

69
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:00,880
而你经历了比变老糟糕得多的事情
Something far worse has happened to you.

70
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:03,670
你明白我为何而来
You know what I've come for.

71
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:05,950
我知道你从何而来
I know where you come from.

72
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,010
在你称呼自己为凯洛・伦之前
Before you called yourself Kylo Ren.

73
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,890
天行者所在位置的地图
The map to Skywalker.

74
00:07:10,890 --> 00:07:12,090
我们知道在你身上
We know you found it.

75
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,020
现在你要将这份地图上交给第一秩序
And now you're going to give it to the First Order.

76
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,580
第一秩序源自于黑暗面
The First Order rose from the dark side.

77
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,690
而你不是
You did not.

78
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,360
我会让你见识一下黑暗面的
I'll show you the dark side.

79
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,680
尽管来
You may try.

80
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:29,780
但你不可否认的事实是 那是你的家人
But you cannot deny the truth that is your family.

81
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:31,560
你说的太对了
You're so right.

82
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,900
那么 是谁先开始讲话呢 你还是我
So, who talks first? You talk first? I talk first?

83
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:10,950
老家伙把地图交给你了
The old man gave it to you.

84
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,680
戴着那东西 我很难听懂你说话...
It's just very hard to understand you with all the...

85
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:14,410
- 给我搜 - 我...
- Search him. - ...apparatus.

86
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:20,330
- 什么也没有 长官 - 把他带到船上
- Nothing, sir. - Put him on board.

87
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,960
长官 村民如何处置
Sir, the villagers?

88
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,760
全部灭口
Kill them all.

89
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:35,850
听我命令
On my command.

90
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,160
开火
Fire.

91
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,750
不要啊
Please, no!

92
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,550
这里什么也没有 清除这架战机
Nothing here. Go ahead!

93
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,660
行了
All right.

94
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:53,760
我自己走
All right!

95
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,370
FN-2187
FN-2187.

96
00:10:22,030 --> 00:10:24,540
上交你的爆能枪以供检查
Submit your blaster for inspection.

97
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,460
遵命 队长
Yes, Captain.

98
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,710
谁准许你摘掉头盔的
And who gave you permission to remove that helmet?

99
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,360
是我的错 队长
I'm sorry, Captain.

100
00:10:31,460 --> 00:10:33,550
马上去我的部门报告
Report to my division at once.

101
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,510
今天你带过来的东西也就值...
What you brought me today is worth...

102
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,300
嗯
hmm...

103
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:28,350
四分之一份口粮
one quarter portion.

104
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,430
太感谢啦
Oh, thank you.

105
00:15:27,050 --> 00:15:28,320
嘘
Shh.

106
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,340
那是个蒂多 想把你拆成零件
That's just Teedo. Wants you for parts.

107
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:34,640
他对任何人都没有丝毫的尊重
He has no respect for anyone.

108
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:39,440
你的天线折弯了
Your antenna's bent.

109
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,240
你来自哪里
Where do you come from?

110
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:53,880
我不能讲的 这是机密
I am not suppose to tell, it's classified.

111
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,810
机密 真的假的
Classified, really?

112
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:57,200
我也是机密人士
Me too. Big secret.

113
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:01,210
尼伊马贸易哨站在那个方向 离开尔文山脉远一点
Niima Outpost is that way. Stay off Kelvin Ridge.

114
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,170
千万别靠近北部下沉区
Keep away from the Sinking Fields in the north.

115
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,750
否则你会淹没在沙子里的
You'll drown in the sand.

116
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,380
你真是太善良啦 我想跟你一起走
You are so very kind. I would like to come with you.

117
00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:12,970
别跟着我 镇子在那个方向
Don't follow me. Town is that way.

118
00:16:13,090 --> 00:16:16,180
那我可以跟你待在一起吗
Oh. Then, can I stay with you?

119
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:17,180
不行
No!

120
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:20,590
人家好害怕的
I am scared.

121
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:35,200
明早你就出发离开
In the morning, you go.

122
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:39,200
再次谢谢你
Thank you, again.

123
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,120
不客气
You're welcome.

124
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:56,820
我们抓到了抵抗组织的王牌飞行员
I had no idea we had the best pilot

125
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,930
我竟毫不知情
in the Resistance on board.

126
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:01,350
躺得还舒服吗
Comfortable?

127
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:02,940
不太舒服
Not really.

128
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,690
我很是佩服
I'm impressed.

129
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:13,490
居然没人能撬开你的嘴 获取地图的下落
No one has been able to get out of you what you did with the map.

130
00:17:13,990 --> 00:17:16,320
你可得重新考虑下你的审问技巧了
You might want to rethink your technique.

131
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,430
地图在哪里
Where is it?

132
00:17:36,090 --> 00:17:39,810
抵抗组织不会屈服于你的淫威之下的
The Resistance... will not be intimidated by you.

133
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,770
到底在哪里
Where... is it?

134
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:59,480
地图藏在一个BB型机器人体内
It's in a droid. A BB unit.

135
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,020
好 如果这个机器人在贾库 我们很快就会找到它的
Well, then, if it's on Jakku, we'll soon have it.

136
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,790
那这件事就交给你了
I leave that to you.

137
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,610
不要放弃希望 他还是可能会出现的
Don't give up hope. He still might show up.

138
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,820
不管你等的是谁
Whoever it is you're waiting for.

139
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,380
机密人物
Classified.

140
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:15,130
我十分了解等待的滋味
I know all about waiting.

141
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,180
我的家人
For my family.

142
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:21,600
总有一天会回来的
They'll be back. One day.

143
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,390
来吧
Come on.

144
00:18:26,390 --> 00:18:29,560
这五件价值...
These five pieces are worth...

145
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,520
让我想想
Let me see here... hmm...

146
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,590
二分之一份口粮
one half portion.

147
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:37,400
上周每一件还值二分之一口粮的
Last week they were a half portion each.

148
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:39,200
这个机器人呢
What about the droid?

149
00:18:42,030 --> 00:18:43,080
机器人怎么了
What about him?

150
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,370
我愿意买下他
I'll pay for him.

151
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:53,550
60份口粮
Sixty portions.

152
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,560
其实
Actually...

153
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:10,480
这个机器人我不卖
The droid's not for sale.

154
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:13,820
走吧
Come on.

155
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,490
跟着这个女孩 给我抓到那个机器人
Follow the girl and get that droid.

156
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:25,790
伦要见犯人
Ren wants the prisoner.

157
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:36,300
这边转弯
Turn here.

158
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,240
好好听着
Listen carefully.

159
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:41,580
如果你完全按照我说的做 我可以帮你离开这里
If you do exactly as I say, I can get you out of here.

160
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:42,680
你说啥
What?

161
00:19:43,930 --> 00:19:46,000
这是一项援救行动 我是来帮你逃出去的
This is a rescue. I'm helping you escape.

162
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,830
你会驾驶TIE战斗机吗
Can you fly a TIE fighter?

163
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:48,980
你是抵抗组织成员吗
You're with the Resistance?

164
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:51,000
什么 不是 我只是来帮你逃出去
What? No, no, no. I'm breaking you out.

165
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:51,910
你会驾驶TIE战斗机吗
- Can you fly a TIE fighter?

166
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:53,110
没有什么飞行器是我驾驶不了的
- I can fly anything.

167
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:56,440
为什么 你为什么帮我
Why? Why are you helping me?

168
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,530
因为这才是应该做的事情
Because it's the right thing to do.

169
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,490
你需要一位飞行员
You need a pilot.

170
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:02,950
我的确需要一位飞行员
I need a pilot.

171
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:05,530
我们就要逃出去了
We're gonna do this.

172
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:06,870
是吗
Yeah?

173
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,360
好了 保持冷静
Okay. Stay calm. Stay calm.

174
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,960
- 我挺冷静的 - 我是在跟自己说
- I am calm. - I'm talking to myself.

175
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,460
还不行
Not yet.

176
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:23,050
可以了 这边走
Okay, go. This way.

177
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:31,380
我一直都想着能驾驶一下TIE战斗机呢
I've always wanted to fly one of these things.

178
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,550
- 你会射击吗 - 我会用爆能枪
- Can you shoot? - Blasters, I can.

179
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:34,960
好 原理是一样的
Okay, same principle.

180
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:37,820
使用左侧开关切换导弹 加农炮和麦加脉冲
Use the toggle on the left to switch between missiles, cannons and mag pulse.

181
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,360
右边的准星用来瞄准
Use the sight on the right to aim.

182
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,570
- 扳柄用来开火 - 这也太复杂了吧
- Triggers to fire. - This is very complicated.

183
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,240
我能解决
I can fix this.

184
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,070
第二停机场有一架战机未经许可起飞
We have an unsanctioned departure from bay two.

185
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,920
通知赫克斯将军 并阻止那艘战机
Alert General Hux. And stop that fighter.

186
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:22,860
- 十四失败 十八 - 搞定
- Fourteen failed. Eighteen... - I got it.

187
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,330
这家伙速度真快
This thing really moves.

188
00:21:32,910 --> 00:21:35,080
好了 我们要是想跑远点
We gotta take out as many of these cannons as we can...

189
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:36,280
就得尽可能地炸掉这些加农炮
or we're not gonna get very far.

190
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,780
- 好的 - 我会驾驶到适当位置
- All right. - I'm gonna get us in position.

191
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:38,880
保持警惕
Just stay sharp.

192
00:21:42,090 --> 00:21:43,660
前方 前方 看到了吗
Up ahead! Up ahead! You see it?

193
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,780
我驾驶到正中央了
I got us dead center.

194
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,010
- 这一发畅通无阻 - 明白
- It's a clean shot. - Okay, got it.

195
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:56,170
- 太棒了 - 真厉害
- Yeah! - Yes!

196
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,340
你看到了吗
Did you see that?

197
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,060
- 看到有多准了吗 - 看到了
- Did you see that? - I saw it!

198
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,850
嘿 你叫什么
Hey, what's your name?

199
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,180
FN-2187

200
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:08,470

F... What?

201
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:10,410
这是他们给我的唯一名字
That's the only name they ever gave me.

202
00:22:10,530 --> 00:22:12,980
我不会用这个来称呼你 FN 是吧
Well, I ain't using it. F-N, huh?

203
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,560
芬恩 我打算叫你芬恩
Finn. I'm gonna call you Finn.

204
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,270
- 可以吗 - 芬恩
- Is that all right? - Finn.

205
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,030
好 芬恩 我喜欢这个名字
Yeah. Finn, I like that.

206
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:20,280
- 我太喜欢啦 - 我是波 波・达默龙
- I like that. - I'm Poe. Poe Dameron.

207
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,300
- 很高兴认识你 波 - 我也是
- Good to meet you, Poe. - Good to meet you too, Finn.

208
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,300
长官 那两个家伙把我们的涡轮激光炮炸毁了
Sir, they've taken out our turbolasers.

209
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:30,470
使用腹侧炮
Use the ventral cannons.

210
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,710
遵命 长官 正在激活腹侧炮
Yes, sir. Bringing them online.

211
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:35,500
赫克斯将军 是那个抵抗组织的飞行员吗
General Hux, is it the Resistance pilot?

212
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,480
是的 而帮他逃出去的是我们自己人中的一个
Yes, and he had help from one of our own.

213
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:43,480
正在检查登记信息以识别出该冲锋兵的身份
We're checking the registers now to identify which stormtrooper it was.

214
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:46,990
是来自村庄那个 FN-2187
The one from the village. FN-2187.

215
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:49,410
长官 腹侧炮准备完毕
Sir, ventral cannons hot.

216
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,900
发射
Fire.

217
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,990
朝着你过来的是什么 在我右边 你的左边
One's coming toward you! My right. Your left.

218
00:23:02,090 --> 00:23:03,840
- 看到了吗 - 等等
- Do you see it? - Hold on.

219
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:04,960
我看到了
I see him!

220
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,840
干得漂亮
Nice shot!

221
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:17,270
我们这是往哪里去
Where are we going?

222
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:18,520
我们得返回贾库
We're going back to Jakku. That's where.

223
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,170
不不不 我们不能回去
No. We can't go back to Jakku.

224
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:21,710
我们得赶紧逃出这个星系
We need to get out of this system.

225
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,690
我必须抢在第一秩序之前找到我的机器人
I gotta get my droid before the First Order does.

226
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:25,050
- 什么 机器人 - 没错
- What, a droid? - That's right.

227
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:27,360
BB型机器人 橙白相间 独一无二
He's a BB unit, orange and white. One of a kind.

228
00:23:27,490 --> 00:23:28,470
我才不在乎他是什么颜色
I don't care what color he is!

229
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:29,810
一个机器人不重要
No droid can be that important.

230
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:30,890
这个机器人举足轻重 兄弟
This one is, pal!

231
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:32,660
我们需要离第一秩序远一点 越远越好
We gotta get as far away from the First Order as we can.

232
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,060
回到贾库 必死无疑
We go back to Jakku, we die.

233
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,710
这个机器人携带着一个能指引我们
That droid has a map that leads

234
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:36,850
找到卢克・天行者的地图
straight to Luke Skywalker.

235
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,870
你在逗我吧
Oh, you gotta be kidding me!

236
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:45,050
FN-2187向我的部门报告
FN-2187 reported to my division...

237
00:23:45,170 --> 00:23:47,450
进行评估之后 送去重建条件反射
was evaluated, and sent to reconditioning.

238
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:49,780
之前没有失控的征兆吗
No prior signs of nonconformity?

239
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,790
这是他第一次进攻
This was his first offense.

240
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:52,990
将军
General!

241
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:54,450
- 他们被击中了 - 剿灭了吗
- They've been hit. - Destroyed?

242
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:55,790
已丧失战斗力
Disabled.

243
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:57,290
他们往贾库去了
They were headed back to Jakku.

244
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:59,580
CIS推断坠机发生在戈亚逊石漠
The fighter is projected to crash in the Goazon badlands.

245
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,350
他们回去找机器人了
They were going back for the droid.

246
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,400
派出小队去往残骸处
Send a squad to the wreckage.

247
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:26,920
波
Poe!

248
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,550
波
Poe!

249
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,420
波
Poe!

250
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,390
波 我来救你
Poe! I got you.

251
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:39,560
波
Poe!

252
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:47,440
波
Poe!

253
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:13,860
最高领袖斯诺克的命令很明确
Supreme Leader Snoke was explicit.

254
00:26:14,030 --> 00:26:16,430
尽可能活捉机器人 如果情况紧急 就摧毁它
Capture the droid if we can, but destroy it if we must.

255
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,320
将军 你的士兵有多少能耐呢
How capable are your soldiers, General?

256
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,890
我不会让你质疑我的方法的
I won't have you question my methods.

257
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,040
他们在犯叛国罪方面显然训练有素
They're obviously skilled at committing high treason.

258
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:24,960
或许斯诺克领袖应该考虑下使用克隆人军队
Perhaps Leader Snoke should consider using a clone army.

259
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,110
我的士兵都是经过特殊训练的
My men are exceptionally trained.

260
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:27,400
自出生起就按照预定步骤进行
Programmed from birth.

261
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:29,780
那么他们就完全可以找回机器人
Then they should have no problem retrieving the droid.

262
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,880
并且是毫发无损
Unharmed.

263
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,110
小心点 伦 你的个人兴趣
Careful, Ren, that your personal interests...

264
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:36,680
妨碍了领袖斯诺克命令的执行
not interfere with orders from Leader Snoke.

265
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,240
我想要那张地图
I want that map.

266
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,720
为你着想
For your sake...

267
00:26:40,850 --> 00:26:42,060
我建议你还是想办法找到它吧
I suggest you get it.

268
00:26:48,650 --> 00:26:49,800
水 水啊
Water. Water.

269
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:50,920
没水
No water.

270
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,520
- 有水吗 - 没有
Water.

271
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:55,470
还有水吗
Is there water?

272
00:27:21,370 --> 00:27:23,310
姑娘 你的机器人 我想要
Girl, your droid. I want it.

273
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,250
什么 离他远点
What? Oi, get off him!

274
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:36,740
嘿
Hey!

275
00:27:50,890 --> 00:27:53,000
那些家伙是什么人哪
Who are those people.

276
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:55,170
他们为昂卡工作
They work for Unkar.

277
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,030
那些家伙想要你
That guy that wanted you.

278
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,760
他肯定真的很想要你
He must have really wanted you.

279
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,860
小姐 那个男人
Mistress! That man!

280
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,180
谁
Who?

281
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:03,880
那边那个
That man over there.

282
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:04,600
就是他
Him?

283
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:05,920
是的
Yes.

284
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,070
他穿着我主人的外套
He is wearing my master's jacket.

285
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:28,080
- 小贼 你急什么呢 - 啥 小贼
- What's your hurry, thief? - What? Thief?

286
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,690
噢
Ow!

287
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,060
- 嘿 你干嘛 - 这件外套
- Hey, what? - The jacket.

288
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,670
机器人说是你偷来的
This droid says you stole it.

289
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,290
我今天已经过得够糟糕了好不好
I've had a pretty messed up day, all right?

290
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:37,840
要是你不再指控我 我会十分感谢
So I'd appreciate it if you stop accusing me of...

291
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:40,370
- 别这么干了 - 你从哪搞来的
- Ow! Stop it! - Where'd you get it?

292
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:41,800
这是它主人的东西
It belongs to his master.

293
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,180
波・达默龙的外套 这是他的名字 对不对
It belonged to Poe Dameron. That was his name, right?

294
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,850
他被第一秩序俘虏了
He was captured by the First Order.

295
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,560
我帮他逃了出来 然后我们的飞船坠毁了
I helped him escape, but our ship crashed.

296
00:28:58,690 --> 00:28:59,820
波没能挺过来
Poe didn't make it.

297
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,830
我尝试去救他 但没成功
I tried to help him. I'm sorry.

298
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,710
所以你是抵抗组织的人
So you're with the Resistance?

299
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:22,670
显而易见
Obviously.

300
00:29:22,840 --> 00:29:24,120
没错
Yes, I am.

301
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,510
我是抵抗组织的人 对
I'm with the Resistance, yeah.

302
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,680
我是抵抗组织的一员
I am with the Resistance.

303
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:31,310
我之前从没见过抵抗组织的战士
I've never met a Resistance fighter before.

304
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:34,290
就长我这样 我们的一部分人长这样
Well, this is what we look like.

305
00:29:34,390 --> 00:29:36,920
其他人长别的样子
Some of us. Others look different.

306
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,470
BB-8说他在执行一个秘密任务
BB-8 says he's on a secret mission.

307
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:40,070
他必须返回你们的基地
He has to get back to your base.

308
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:42,950
据说他有一份通向卢克・天行者所在地的地图
Apparently, he has a map that leads to Luke Skywalker

309
00:29:42,950 --> 00:29:44,200
所有人都想得到它
and everyone's after it.

310
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:46,530
卢克・天行者
Luke Skywalker?

311
00:29:47,070 --> 00:29:48,580
我以为他是个神话
I thought he was a myth.

312
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:50,820
什么
What?

313
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,420
- 你在干什么 - 快跑
- What are you doing? - Come on.

314
00:30:01,710 --> 00:30:02,880
跟上 BB-8
Come on, BB-8!

315
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,720
- 放开我 - 快跑 我们得离开这儿
- Let go of me! - Come on, we gotta move!

316
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:09,930
你不拉着我的手 我也知道怎么跑
I know how to run without you holding my hand!

317
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,290
BB-8 跟紧点
BB-8, stay close!

318
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:15,390
往这走
This way.

319
00:30:21,190 --> 00:30:22,400
请求空中支援
Call in the air strike.

320
00:30:23,230 --> 00:30:24,780
快点
Come on!

321
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,450
咱们俩都是他们的目标
They're shooting at both of us.

322
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:29,450
他们看见你跟我在一起 你已经被标记了
Yeah. They saw you with me. You're marked.

323
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:30,980
- 那还不是拜你所赐 - 嘿
- Well, thanks for that. - Hey!

324
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,910
直接用棍子把人抡倒可不是我
I'm not the one who chased you down with a stick.

325
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,690
这儿的人就没有爆能枪吗
Does anyone have blasters around here?

326
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,320
你还好吗
Are you okay?

327
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,300
别抓我的手
Stop taking my hand!

328
00:31:00,610 --> 00:31:01,610
醒醒
Hey.

329
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,940
你没事吗
Are you okay?

330
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:08,950
恩
Yeah.

331
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:10,740
跟我来
Follow me.

332
00:31:22,290 --> 00:31:24,900
- 我们跑不过他们 - 可以的 用那辆四跃飞船
- We can't outrun them! - We might in that quadjumper!

333
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:26,340
嗨 我们需要一个飞行员
Hey, we need a pilot!

334
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:28,010
已经有了
We've got one.

335
00:31:28,130 --> 00:31:29,130
你吗
You?

336
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,740
那艘飞船怎么样
Uh, what about that ship?

337
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,300
那艘是垃圾
That one's garbage!

338
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,270
死马当活马医吧
The garbage will do.

339
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,870
射击手的位置在那下面
Gunner position is down there!

340
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,750
你驾驶过这飞船吗
You ever fly this thing?

341
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,000
没有 这飞船已经很多年没被使用过了
No! This ship hasn't flown in years.

342
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,170
好吧
Great.

343
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,590
哇哦
Whoa.

344
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:14,800
我能行的 我能做到
I can do this. I can do this.

345
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,850
我能行的 我能做到
I can do this. I can do this.

346
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,040
嘿
Hey!

347
00:32:43,370 --> 00:32:44,920
那是我的
That's mine!

348
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,090
等等 保持低空飞行 低空飞行
Wait, stay low! Hey, stay low!

349
00:32:50,210 --> 00:32:51,280
- 什么 - 贴地飞行
- What? - Stay low!

350
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:52,590
扰乱他们的追踪
It confuses their tracking.

351
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:54,890
- BB-8 坐稳了 - 为森么
BB-8, hold on!

352
00:32:55,050 --> 00:32:56,430
我要往下冲了
I'm going low!

353
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:16,280
你在后头干什么呢
What are you doing back there?

354
00:33:16,410 --> 00:33:17,580
你还不还击 你在等什么
Are you ever gonna fire back?

355
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:19,790
我在想办法 保护罩打开了吗
I'm working on it! Are the shields up?

356
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:21,580
没有副驾驶员协助 我没那么轻松
Not so easy without a co-pilot!

357
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:23,620
那你应该试试坐在这玩意儿上
Try sitting in this thing.

358
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,260
我们需要掩护 立刻马上
We need cover, quick!

359
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:40,710
马上就会有了
We're about to get some!

360
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,020
希望如愿
I hope.

361
00:33:57,470 --> 00:33:58,730
哇哦
Whoa.

362
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:09,210
该死的
Damn it!

363
00:34:20,180 --> 00:34:21,970
拜托 给点力
Come on, come on!

364
00:34:24,810 --> 00:34:27,060
- 干得好 - 我现在做射击手还挺厉害
- Nice shot! - I'm getting pretty good at this.

365
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:32,170
大家快趴下
Let's get down!

366
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,690
机关炮在冲前的位置上卡死了
Uh, the cannon's stuck in forward position.

367
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,450
我无法移动它 你只有甩掉他们才行了
I can't move it. You gotta lose him!

368
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,840
- 做好准备 - 好的 做什么准备
- Get ready! - Okay. For what?

369
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,770
我们真要这么做吗
Are we really doing this?

370
00:35:15,190 --> 00:35:16,530
噢 不
Oh, no.

371
00:35:37,970 --> 00:35:38,970
哇哦
Whoo!

372
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,840
- 刚才的飞行真厉害 - 你射击也不错
- Nice shooting. - Now that was some flying.

373
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,930
- 谢谢 - 你是怎么做到的
- Thanks. - How did you do that?

374
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,300
- 我也不知道 - 没人训练过你吗
- I don't know. - No one trained you?

375
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,140
但我还从来没飞离过星球
I've flown some ships, but I've never left the planet.

376
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,390
- 你的最后一击太棒了 - 那简直无与伦比
- Your last shot was dead-on. - That was amazing.

377
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,810
- 你爆掉了他 - 多亏了你的好助攻
- You got him with one blast! - You set me up for it.

378
00:36:01,910 --> 00:36:03,270
- 简直是完美 - 确实很不错
- It was perfect. - That was pretty good.

379
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:08,910
你很安全 他是抵抗组织的一员
You're okay. He's with the Resistance.

380
00:36:10,290 --> 00:36:11,920
他会带你回家的
He's gonna get you home.

381
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,040
我们一起
We both will.

382
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,010
我还不知道你的名字
I don't know your name.

383
00:36:22,970 --> 00:36:24,510
芬恩 你叫什么
Finn. What's yours?

384
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,100
我是蕾伊
I'm Rey.

385
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,980
蕾伊
Rey...

386
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,880
来帮我处理这个 快点
Help me with this. Quick!

387
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,360
发生什么了
Whoa, what's going on?

388
00:36:48,620 --> 00:36:52,500
长官 我们没能在贾库星抓捕到那个机器人
Sir... we were unable to acquire the droid on Jakku.

389
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:58,800
他乘坐一艘被盗的科瑞利安YT型号运输舰逃脱了追捕
It escaped capture aboard a stolen Corellian YT model freighter.

390
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:02,410
那个机器人
The droid...

391
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:04,140
偷走了一艘运输舰
stole a freighter?

392
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,640
并非如此 长官
Not exactly, sir.

393
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,310
他有帮手
It had help.

394
00:37:10,930 --> 00:37:11,990
虽然还未经证实
We have no confirmation

395
00:37:11,990 --> 00:37:14,520
但我们怀疑是FN-2187协助了他逃离
but we believe FN-2187 may have helped in the escape.

396
00:37:32,870 --> 00:37:33,870
还有别的情况吗
Anything else?

397
00:37:36,750 --> 00:37:38,170
与他们同行的还有一个女孩
The two were accompanied by a girl.

398
00:37:43,590 --> 00:37:45,340
什么女孩
What girl?

399
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:49,120
是动力源的问题
It's the motivator.

400
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,710
给我一把哈里斯扳手 在那找找
Grab me a Harris wrench, check in there.

401
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:51,790
情况有多糟
How bad is it?

402
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,560
如果我们还想靠它活下去的话 不太好
If we wanna live, not good.

403
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:54,630
他们现在还在追捕我们
They're hunting for us now.

404
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:55,900
我们必须得离开这个星系
We've gotta get out of this system!

405
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:58,730
BB-8说抵抗组织基地的位置只有内部人员知道
BB-8 said the location of the Resistance base is "need to know".

406
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,470
如果我要带你们去那的话 我需要知道那个地点
If I'm taking you there, I need to know!

407
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:01,570
这个吗
This?

408
00:38:02,820 --> 00:38:04,450
你得告诉我们你的基地在哪儿
You gotta tell us where your base is.

409
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,450
什么 不行
What? No.

410
00:38:05,570 --> 00:38:07,140
我不会说你这门语言
I don't speak that.

411
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,980
好吧 我只告诉你
All right, between us...

412
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,530
我不是抵抗组织的人 好吧
I'm not with the Resistance, okay?

413
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,100
我只是想逃离第一秩序
I'm just trying to get away from the First Order.

414
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,940
不过如果你告诉我基地在哪儿
But you tell us where the base is...

415
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,460
我就把你先送到那去 成交吗
I'll get you there first. Deal?

416
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,040
- 机器人 拜托 - 派莱克斯扳手 快点
- Droid, please! - Pilex driver, hurry.

417
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:22,000
- 所以你们的基地在哪儿 - 好的 BB-8 告诉她
- So, where's your base? - Go on, BB-8, tell her.

418
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,300
咦 呃
Huh? Eh.

419
00:38:23,350 --> 00:38:25,020
咦 呃
Huh? Eh.

420
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,970
咦
Huh?

421
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:27,010
求你了
Please.

422
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:30,930
- 伊利尼姆星系 - 对 伊利尼姆星系
- The Ileenium system? - Yeah, the Ileenium system.

423
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:32,680
就是那 把我们送到那去 越快越好
That's the one. Get us there as fast as you can.

424
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,390
我把你们两个送到波尼马终点站
I'll drop you two at Ponemah Terminal.

425
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:35,630
我需要发动机胶带 赶紧
I need the bonding tape, hurry!

426
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:36,790
你要去哪儿
What about you?

427
00:38:36,890 --> 00:38:38,100
我必须得回贾库星去
I gotta get back to Jakku.

428
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:39,170
回贾库
Back to Jak...

429
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:40,720
为什么所有人都要回贾库星
Why does everyone wanna go back to Jakku?

430
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:43,400
- 不是这个 不对 不对 - 那个地方
- It's not that one. No. No. - That place is...

431
00:38:43,530 --> 00:38:45,390
是我手指的那个 不对
The one I'm pointing to. No.

432
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:46,780
不对 不对
No. No!

433
00:38:46,900 --> 00:38:48,240
如果我们不把漏气的地方补上
If we don't patch it up...

434
00:38:48,410 --> 00:38:51,180
毒气会从气箱里漫出来 有毒气体会充满整艘飞船
the propulsion tank will overflow and flood the ship with poisonous gas!

435
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,280
- 这个 - 是的
- This? - Yes.

436
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:56,480
嗨 蕾伊 你是一位飞行员
Hey, Rey, you're a pilot.

437
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:58,480
你想飞去哪儿都行 为什么要回去
You can fly anywhere. Why go back?

438
00:38:58,580 --> 00:38:59,860
你有家人在那里
You got a family?

439
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:01,090
还是男朋友在那里 一个帅哥男友
You got a boyfriend? A cute boyfriend?

440
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,650
原因就是 关你屁事
None of your business, that's why.

441
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:06,470
- 准没什么好事 - 去驾驶舱
- That can't be good. - No, it can't be.

442
00:39:12,430 --> 00:39:13,430
我们被人锁定了
Someone's locked on to us.

443
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,100
所有控制系统已经失灵
All controls are overridden.

444
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,610
放开 别碰我
Get off! Get off!

445
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,360
你看见什么了
See anything?

446
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:28,820
噢 不
Oh, no.

447
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:38,060
是第一秩序
It's the First Order.

448
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,960
我们要怎么办 肯定有什么对策
What do we do? There must be something.

449
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:42,400
- 你刚刚说有有毒气体 - 我已经堵上了
- You said poisonous gas. - I fixed that.

450
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,500
你能再把它打开吗
Can you unfix it?

451
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,300
过来 BB-8
Come on, BB-8.

452
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:52,930
我接住他了
I got him.

453
00:39:55,290 --> 00:39:56,680
我没事
I'm okay.

454
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,390
BB-8 从我身上下来
BB-8, get off me!

455
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,920
你觉得这招对帝国冲锋队员有用吗
Do you think this will work on the stormtroopers?

456
00:40:03,020 --> 00:40:05,570
有用 他们的面具可以过滤烟雾但不防毒
Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins.

457
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,120
快点 他们来了
- Hurry. - I'm hurrying.

458
00:40:26,210 --> 00:40:28,610
丘伊
Chewie...

459
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:29,970
我们回家了
we're home.

460
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,130
其他人在哪儿
Where are the others?

461
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:48,800
- 飞行员呢 - 我就是飞行员
- Where's the pilot? - I'm the pilot.

462
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,340
- 你 - 她在撒谎
You?

463
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:52,390
不 是真的 飞船上只有我们几个
No, it's true. We're the only ones on board.

464
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,910
你能听懂这玩意儿
You can understand that thing?

465
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:56,270
这玩意儿也能听得懂你说话 所以注意你的用词
And "that thing" can understand you, too, so watch it.

466
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:58,290
从那里面出来
Come on out of there.

467
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:00,870
- 你从哪里得到的这艘飞船 - 尼伊马贸易哨站
- Where'd you get this ship? - Niima Outpost.

468
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,520
贾库星 那个垃圾场
Jakku? That junkyard?

469
00:41:03,620 --> 00:41:04,820
谢谢 就是个垃圾场
Thank you! Junkyard.

470
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,990
我跟你说过我们应该再搜索一遍西境
Told you we should have double-checked the Western Reaches.

471
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,820
它在谁手里 杜凯恩
Who had it? Ducain?

472
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,740
我偷了它 从昂卡・普拉特那
I stole it. From Unkar Plutt.

473
00:41:10,840 --> 00:41:13,050
他从欧文兄弟那偷的 欧文兄弟是从杜凯恩那偷的
He stole it from the Irving Boys, who stole it from Ducain.

474
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,450
他偷的我的
Who stole it from me!

475
00:41:15,550 --> 00:41:16,950
你告诉他汉・索洛
Well, you tell him that Han Solo...

476
00:41:17,050 --> 00:41:19,430
如今又把千年隼偷回来了 不会再丢了
just stole back the Millennium Falcon for good.

477
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:22,430
这艘船是千年隼号 你就是汉・索洛
This is the Millennium Falcon? You're Han Solo?

478
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,600
我曾经是
I used to be.

479
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,720
汉・索洛 那个义军将军
Han Solo, the Rebellion general?

480
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:29,180
不 是走私犯
No, the smuggler.

481
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,090
他不是个战斗英雄吗
Wasn't he a war hero?

482
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:34,510
这就是那艘只用十四秒差距完成科舍尔航程的飞船
This is the ship that made the Kessel Run in 14 parsecs?

483
00:41:34,610 --> 00:41:35,870
十二秒
Twelve!

484
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:38,410
什么十四秒
Fourteen.

485
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:54,930
嗨
Hey!

486
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:58,410
是哪个傻瓜在点火线上装了个压缩机
Some moof-milker put a compressor on the ignition line.

487
00:41:58,510 --> 00:41:59,580
昂卡・普拉特做的
Unkar Plutt did.

488
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,040
我也觉得这是个错误 把太多压力留给了
I thought it was a mistake, too. Puts too much...

489
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,430
- 超光速推进器 - 超光速推进器
...stress on the hyperdrive.

490
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:05,940
丘伊 把他们扔到飞行舱里
Chewie, throw them in a pod.

491
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,920
我们一会儿把他们放到最近的无人星上
We'll drop them at the nearest inhabited planet.

492
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:09,720
等等 不行
Wait, no.

493
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:12,220
- 我们需要你的帮助 - 我的帮助
- We need your help. - My help?

494
00:42:12,320 --> 00:42:15,240
这个机器人必须尽快赶到抵抗组织基地
This droid has to get to the Resistance base as soon as possible.

495
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:18,320
他携带着一份通向卢克・天行者所在地的地图
He's carrying a map to Luke Skywalker.

496
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,750
你是大名鼎鼎的汉・索洛 和义军并肩作战过
You are the Han Solo that fought with the Rebellion.

497
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
你肯定知道他
You knew him.

498
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,290
是的 我知道他
Yeah. I knew him.

499
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:41,010
我认识卢克
I knew Luke.

500
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,100
别告诉我有一只拉思塔逃跑了
Don't tell me a Rathtar's gotten loose.

501
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,770
等等 什么
Wait, what?

502
00:42:48,690 --> 00:42:50,360
你刚刚是说了拉思塔吗
Did you just say Rathtars?

503
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,090
嗨
Hey!

504
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:54,740
你不是在用这艘运输舰走私拉思塔吧
You're not hauling Rathtars on this freighter, are you?

505
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,470
我就是在运送拉思塔
I'm hauling Rathtars.

506
00:42:57,570 --> 00:43:00,770
瓜维亚死亡帮来了
Oh, great. It's the Guavian Death Gang.

507
00:43:00,870 --> 00:43:02,330
他们一定是从南图区域就开始追踪我们
Must have tracked us from Nantoon.

508
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:04,230
拉思塔是什么
What's a Rathtar?

509
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:05,810
它们体型很大并且很危险
They're big and they're dangerous.

510
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:07,440
你听说过特里利亚大屠杀吗
You ever heard of the Trillia Massacre?

511
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,570
- 没有 - 挺好的
- No. - Good.

512
00:43:08,670 --> 00:43:10,530
我要送三只到普拉纳王国去
I got three of them going to King Prana.

513
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:12,950
三只 你是怎么把它们弄上船的
Three? How'd you get them on board?

514
00:43:13,050 --> 00:43:14,760
我们之前人手更多些
I used to have a bigger crew.

515
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,240
到下面去 我让你们上来再上来
Get below and stay there until I say so...

516
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:21,910
别打千年隼的主意
and don't even think about taking the Falcon.

517
00:43:22,010 --> 00:43:23,000
BB-8怎么办
What about BB-8?

518
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:24,790
在我甩掉这帮人之前 他先跟着我
He stays with me until I get rid of the gang...

519
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,420
之后你们就可以带着他 爱去哪儿去哪儿了
then you can have him back and be on your way.

520
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,460
那拉思塔怎么办 你把它们放在哪儿了
What about the Rathtars? Where are you keeping them?

521
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,920
- 那有一只 - 你打算做什么
- There's one. - What are you gonna do?

522
00:43:33,020 --> 00:43:35,300
老样子 按我的方式解决问题
Same thing I always do. Talk my way out of it.

523
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:36,520
你有成功过吗
Do you?

524
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,900
当然 次次管用
Yes, I do. Every time.

525
00:43:56,170 --> 00:43:58,160
汉・索洛
Han Solo.

526
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,720
你死定了
You're a dead man.

527
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,550
巴拉-蒂克 有什么问题吗
Bala-Tik. What's the problem?

528
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,430
我们借了你50000块干这趟活儿 这就是问题
The problem is we loaned you 50,000 for this job.

529
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,060
- 你能看见他们吗 -看不见
- Can you see them? - No.

530
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,230
我听说你也向坎吉俱乐部借了50000块
I heard you also borrowed 50,000 from Kanjiklub.

531
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:13,560
你知道的 那些小怪物不可信
You know you can't trust those little freaks.

532
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:16,630
咱们都认识多久了
How long we known each other?

533
00:44:16,730 --> 00:44:17,800
他们有爆能枪
They have blasters.

534
00:44:17,900 --> 00:44:18,970
有很多
A lot of them.

535
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:22,260
时间不长 我们现在想要回那笔钱
Not long. We want our money back now.

536
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,350
你觉得捕捉拉思塔不要钱吗
You think hunting Rathtars is cheap?

537
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:25,600
那钱我已经花了
I spent that money.

538
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,120
坎吉俱乐部也想要回他们的资金
Kanjiklub wants their investment back, too.

539
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:30,520
我从没和坎吉俱乐部做过交易
I never made a deal with Kanjiklub!

540
00:44:30,620 --> 00:44:32,480
这话你自己跟坎吉俱乐部说
Tell that to Kanjiklub.

541
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,990
塔苏・利奇
Tasu Leech.

542
00:44:44,090 --> 00:44:45,100
很高兴见到你啊
Good to see you.

543
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,920
兄弟们 我答应好的东西我会给你们的
Boys, you're both gonna get what I promised.

544
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:58,380
难道我曾经有
Have I ever not delivered...

545
00:44:58,480 --> 00:44:59,990
- 言而无信过吗 - 有啊
- for you before? - Yeah.

546
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:07,280
- 第二次是什么事 - 故技重施
- What was the second time? - Your game is old.

547
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:09,910
在这个星系里不会有人再相信你的骗局了
There's no one in the galaxy left for you to swindle.

548
00:45:12,580 --> 00:45:13,570
那个BB型机器人
That BB unit.

549
00:45:13,670 --> 00:45:16,500
第一秩序正在找的那个机器人 跟它一模一样
The First Order is looking for one just like it.

550
00:45:20,010 --> 00:45:21,300
还有两个逃犯
And two fugitives.

551
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,300
这事我第一次听说
First I've heard of it.

552
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:33,310
等等 等等
Wait, wait, wait.

553
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:38,420
如果我们可以把走廊上的防爆门关上
If we close the blast doors in that corridor

554
00:45:38,420 --> 00:45:39,760
就能把那两帮的人困住
we can trap both gangs!

555
00:45:39,860 --> 00:45:41,300
从这里把门关上吗
We'll close the blast doors from here?

556
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,200
重新设定导火线应该就能行
Resetting the fuses should do it.

557
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:52,940
我有种不好的预感
I got a bad feeling about this.

558
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,170
- 惨了 - 什么惨了
- Oh, no. - "Oh, no," what?

559
00:45:56,130 --> 00:45:57,110
拨错导火线了
Wrong fuses.

560
00:45:57,210 --> 00:45:58,380
杀了他们
Kill them!

561
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,710
- 哦 - 抓住那个机器人
- Whoa... - And take the droid!

562
00:46:25,530 --> 00:46:27,360
- 这是个错误的决定 - 错大发了
- This was a mistake! - Huge!

563
00:46:40,590 --> 00:46:41,590
它们长什么样子
What do they look like?

564
00:46:47,550 --> 00:46:49,550
就长那样
They look like that.

565
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:53,640
- 往这走 - 你确定吗
- This way. - Are you sure?

566
00:46:55,560 --> 00:46:56,730
不 不 不 不
No, no, no!

567
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,150
芬恩
Finn!

568
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,230
芬恩
Finn!

569
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:03,400
蕾伊
Rey!

570
00:47:06,570 --> 00:47:07,860
别碰我
Get off! Get off!

571
00:47:13,290 --> 00:47:15,620
- 蕾伊 - 芬恩
- Rey! - Finn!

572
00:47:16,830 --> 00:47:17,920
芬恩
Finn!

573
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,250
放开我
Get off me!

574
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:33,430
蕾伊
Rey!

575
00:47:37,990 --> 00:47:39,870
滚开 滚开
Get off! Get off!

576
00:47:41,770 --> 00:47:43,270
芬恩
Finn!

577
00:47:43,940 --> 00:47:46,280
- 它抓住我了 但是那门 - 真是幸运
- It had me! But the door... - That was lucky.

578
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:52,620
我来开门 掩护我
I got the door. Cover us!

579
00:47:59,460 --> 00:48:01,330
丘伊
Chewie!

580
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:05,800
还好吗
You okay?

581
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:06,700
还好
Yeah.

582
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,970
哇
Wow.

583
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,390
快 快
Come on! Come on!

584
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:17,120
汉
Han.

585
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:19,480
你 把门关上 你 照顾丘伊
You, close the door behind us. You, take care of Chewie!

586
00:48:19,970 --> 00:48:21,430
啊
Awww!

587
00:48:27,150 --> 00:48:28,390
你干嘛
Hey, where are you going?

588
00:48:28,490 --> 00:48:30,140
昂卡・普拉特在这安装了一个燃油泵
Unkar Plutt installed a fuel pump, too.

589
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:32,030
不把它填装好 我们哪也去不了
If we don't prime that, we're not going anywhere.

590
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,320
我恨他
I hate that guy.

591
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:35,930
- 你以前还有副驾驶 - 有一个 现在在后面
- And you could use a co-pilot. - I got one, he's back there.

592
00:48:38,410 --> 00:48:40,370
看着推进器 我们要以光速离开这里
Watch the thrust. We're going out of here at lightspeed.

593
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,270
从吊舱内部 这可能吗
From inside the hangar? Is that even possible?

594
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:44,610
我都是在做完了才问这个问题的
I never ask that question till after I've done it.

595
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:49,010
这可不是我想象中的一天
This is not how I thought this day was gonna go.

596
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:51,070
打开防护盾 后面的人坐好了
Angle the shield. Hang on back there.

597
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,340
没问题
No problem!

598
00:49:02,270 --> 00:49:03,520
拜托 宝贝 别让我失望
Come on, baby, don't let me down.

599
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:08,030
- 什么来着 - 压缩机
- What? - Compressor.

600
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:19,650
通知第一秩序 他们要的机器人在汉・索洛手里
Inform the First Order that Han Solo has the droid they want.

601
00:49:19,750 --> 00:49:21,750
它在千年隼号上
And it's aboard the Millennium Falcon.

602
00:49:30,670 --> 00:49:35,050
那个机器人很快会被送到抵抗组织
The droid will soon be delivered to the Resistance...

603
00:49:36,260 --> 00:49:40,060
带他们找到最后一个绝地武士
leading them to the last Jedi.

604
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:45,020
如果天行者回归
If Skywalker returns...

605
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:49,570
新一代绝地武士就会崛起
the new Jedi will rise.

606
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:52,280
最高领袖 我会负起全责
Supreme Leader, I take full responsibility...

607
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:54,070
将军
General!

608
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:59,080
我们必须要改变战略了
Our strategy must now change.

609
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,240
武器已经准备就绪
The weapon. It is ready.

610
00:50:01,370 --> 00:50:03,620
我相信是时候派上用场了
I believe the time has come to use it.

611
00:50:03,750 --> 00:50:06,530
我们将摧毁支持抵抗组织的政府
We shall destroy the government that supports the Resistance...

612
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:08,320
共和国政府
the Republic.

613
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:11,630
没有了朋友的支持 抵抗组织就会变得力量薄弱
Without their friends to protect them the Resistance will be vulnerable.

614
00:50:11,880 --> 00:50:14,780
在他们找到天行者之前拦截他们
And we will stop them before they reach Skywalker.

615
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,130
去吧
Go.

616
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,330
监督好准备工作
Oversee preparations.

617
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,100
是 最高领袖
Yes, Supreme Leader.

618
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:27,440
有个人已经觉醒
There has been an awakening.

619
00:50:29,150 --> 00:50:30,900
你感觉到了吗
Have you felt it?

620
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,490
是的
Yes.

621
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:36,490
还有更多的东西
There's something more.

622
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:42,200
我们要找的机器人在千年隼号上
The droid we seek is aboard the Millennium Falcon.

623
00:50:42,990 --> 00:50:45,860
在你父亲手中
In the hands of your father...

624
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:49,790
汉・索洛
Han Solo.

625
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,800
他对我而言毫无意义
He means nothing to me.

626
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:59,720
即便是你 伦武士团的大师
Even you, master of the Knights of Ren...

627
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:03,810
也从未面临过如此挑战
have never faced such a test.

628
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,640
承蒙您的培养 我不会受此诱惑的
By the grace of your training, I will not be seduced.

629
00:51:08,770 --> 00:51:10,610
我们拭目以待
We shall see.

630
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,030
我们拭目以待
We shall see.

631
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,330
- 电力超负荷了 - 我能修好
- Electrical overload. - I can fix that.

632
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:26,710
冷却剂泄露了
Coolant's leaking.

633
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:30,780
- 尝试把辅助电力转移到 - 第二燃料箱
- Try transferring auxiliary power... - ...to the secondary tank.

634
00:51:30,880 --> 00:51:32,420
知道了
I got it.

635
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:34,210
丘伊 拜托
Chewie, come on!

636
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:37,410
我需要帮忙制住这个大毛怪
I need help with this giant hairy thing!

637
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:38,510
- 来了 - 别过来
Stop moving!

638
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:40,460
啊
Awww!

639
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:42,350
- 丘伊 - 他需要帮助
Chewie!

640
00:51:42,470 --> 00:51:44,180
你要是伤害丘伊 就是和我作对
You hurt Chewie, you're gonna deal with me!

641
00:51:44,310 --> 00:51:46,640
伤害他 他几乎杀了我六次了
Hurt him? He almost killed me six times!

642
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:49,020
这下好了
Which is fine!

643
00:51:49,140 --> 00:51:50,540
如果超光速引擎爆炸
This hyperdrive blows,

644
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:52,650
我们将会变成三个不同星系的碎片
there are gonna be pieces of us in three different systems.

645
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,030
你做了什么
What'd you do?

646
00:51:58,070 --> 00:51:59,990
我绕开了压缩机
I bypassed the compressor.

647
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,330
哈
Huh.

648
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:07,870
走开 圆球
Move, ball.

649
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:14,590
别那么说 你做得很棒 休息一下
Ah, don't say that. You did great. Just rest.

650
00:52:14,790 --> 00:52:15,880
做得好 孩子
Good job, kid.

651
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:17,340
谢谢
Thanks.

652
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:19,160
不客气
You're welcome.

653
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,810
所以 你们是逃犯 哈
So... fugitives, huh?

654
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:30,000
第一秩序想要那张地图
The First Order wants the map.

655
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,390
芬恩是抵抗组织成员
Finn is with the Resistance.

656
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:33,440
我只是一个拾荒者
I'm just a scavenger.

657
00:52:35,480 --> 00:52:36,480
让我们看看你拿到了什么
Let's see what you got.

658
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,440
- 可以吗 - 给他看吧
Go ahead.

659
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:52,700
这张地图并不完整 只是其中一块
This map's not complete. It's just a piece.

660
00:52:53,540 --> 00:52:57,450
自从卢克失踪 人们就一直在找他
Ever since Luke disappeared people have been looking for him.

661
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,050
他为什么离开
Why did he leave?

662
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:02,990
他曾经培养了新一代绝地武士
He was training a new generation of Jedi.

663
00:53:03,090 --> 00:53:07,140
有个男孩 他的徒弟 背叛了他 摧毁了一切
One boy, an apprentice, turned against him, destroyed it all.

664
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,630
卢克感到很自责
Luke felt responsible.

665
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:13,230
只好远离一切
He just walked away from everything.

666
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:15,400
你知道在他身上发生过什么吗
Do you know what happened to him?

667
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:17,940
有很多谣言和传说
A lot of rumors. Stories.

668
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:22,150
了解他的人猜测
People that knew him best...

669
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:26,030
他去寻找第一绝地圣殿了
think he went looking for the first Jedi temple.

670
00:53:27,780 --> 00:53:29,100
绝地武士真的存在吗
The Jedi were real?

671
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,400
我曾经也怀疑过
I used to wonder about that myself.

672
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,710
我也曾认为只是一堆胡言乱语
Thought it was a bunch of mumbo-jumbo.

673
00:53:34,580 --> 00:53:37,150
能够结合正义与邪恶
A magical power holding together good and evil...

674
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:39,380
黑暗和光明的神奇力量
the dark side and the light.

675
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,920
难以置信的是
Crazy thing is...

676
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:46,760
这是真的
it's true.

677
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:50,930
原力 绝地武士
The Force. The Jedi.

678
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:54,520
所有一切
All of it.

679
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,090
都是真的
It's all true.

680
00:54:03,190 --> 00:54:05,280
不 你去休息
No, you rest.

681
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:07,270
你想要我帮忙 那你要听我的
You want my help? You're getting it.

682
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:09,490
去见一个老朋友 她会帮你的机器人回家
Gonna see an old friend. She'll get your droid home.

683
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,120
我们到了
This is our stop.

684
00:54:29,510 --> 00:54:32,390
我不知道银河系中居然还有这么多绿色
I didn't know there was this much green in the whole galaxy.

685
00:55:00,380 --> 00:55:02,420
嘿 索洛 我不知道我们来这干嘛
Hey, Solo, I'm not sure what we're walking into here...

686
00:55:02,550 --> 00:55:04,160
你刚刚叫我索洛
Did you just call me Solo?

687
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:05,870
抱歉 汉・索洛先生
Sorry. Han. Mr. Solo.

688
00:55:05,970 --> 00:55:07,030
你应该知道
You should know...

689
00:55:07,130 --> 00:55:09,490
我可是抵抗组织的大人物
I'm a big deal in the Resistance.

690
00:55:09,590 --> 00:55:11,930
他们真正目标是我
Which puts a real target on my back.

691
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:13,620
这里有任何阴谋者吗
Are there any conspirators here?

692
00:55:13,720 --> 00:55:15,600
像是第一秩序支持者
Like, First Order sympathizers?

693
00:55:15,730 --> 00:55:18,380
听着 "大人物"
Listen, Big Deal.

694
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,380
你有其他问题要解决
You got another problem.

695
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,650
女人总是能找出真相
Women always figure out the truth.

696
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:25,570
总是
Always.

697
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:32,950
你会需要这个的
You might need this.

698
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,910
我自己能搞定
I think I can handle myself.

699
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,150
我知道 这就是我为什么把它给你
I know you do. That's why I'm giving it to you.

700
00:55:38,250 --> 00:55:39,250
拿着

701
00:55:42,090 --> 00:55:43,240
你知道怎么使用吗

知道 扣动扳机
Yeah. You pull the trigger.

703
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:46,920
实际上远远不止
Little bit more to it than that.

704
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,090
学无止境
You got a lot to learn.

705
00:55:50,510 --> 00:55:51,760
你叫什么名字
You got a name?

706
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,680
蕾伊
Rey.

707
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:55,390
蕾伊
Rey.

708
00:55:59,270 --> 00:56:01,670
我一直在考虑增加一些船员 蕾伊
I been thinking about bringing on some more crew, Rey.

709
00:56:01,770 --> 00:56:03,720
一个二副 能帮上忙的
A second mate. Someone to help out.

710
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:07,110
能跟上丘伊和我节奏 并且能赏识千年隼号
Someone who can keep up with Chewie and me appreciates the Falcon.

711
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:09,010
你在给我提供工作吗
Are you offering me a job?

712
00:56:09,110 --> 00:56:11,610
我对你不会很好 也不会付很多钱
I wouldn't be nice to you. Doesn't pay much.

713
00:56:11,740 --> 00:56:13,580
你在招募我吗
You're offering me a job.

714
00:56:14,780 --> 00:56:16,290
我只是在考虑
I'm thinking about it.

715
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:21,120
怎么样
Well?

716
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:28,300
你这么说我真是受宠若惊 但我必须回家
If you were, I'd be flattered. But I have to get home.

717
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,720
回哪儿 贾库
Where, Jakku?

718
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:33,090
我已经离开太久了
I've already been away too long.

719
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,180
丘伊 好好检查一下飞船
Chewie, check out the ship as best you can.

720
00:56:40,890 --> 00:56:43,810
那真遗憾 丘伊有点喜欢你呢
That's too bad. Chewie kind of likes you.

721
00:56:46,900 --> 00:56:48,280
索洛 我们来这干什么
- Solo, why are we here again?

722
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:50,200
确保你的机器人能在一艘干净的船上
- To get your droid on a clean ship.

723
00:56:50,320 --> 00:56:51,260
干净
Clean?

724
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:54,240
你觉得我和丘伊找到千年隼号是运气使然吗
You think it was luck that Chewie and I found the Falcon?

725
00:56:54,910 --> 00:56:57,120
如果我们能在扫描仪上找到它
If we can find it on our scanners

726
00:56:57,120 --> 00:56:58,870
第一秩序也离我们不远了
the First Order's not far behind.

727
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:01,770
你想把BB-8送回抵抗组织
Wanna get BB-8 to the Resistance?

728
00:57:01,870 --> 00:57:03,710
玛兹・卡纳塔就是我们最好选择
Maz Kanata's our best bet.

729
00:57:04,580 --> 00:57:06,070
我们能相信她吗
We can trust her, right?

730
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:07,710
放心 孩子
Relax, kid.

731
00:57:07,840 --> 00:57:10,510
她开这个酒馆一千多年了
She's run this watering hole for a thousand years.

732
00:57:11,260 --> 00:57:14,740
玛兹有点古怪 所以由我来跟她谈
Maz is a bit of an acquired taste, so let me do the talking.

733
00:57:14,840 --> 00:57:16,580
无论你们做什么 别盯着看
And whatever you do, don't stare.

734
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:17,720
- 看什么 - 看什么
At what?

735
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,850
任何一切
Any of it.

736
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:43,040
汉・索洛
Han Solo!

737
00:57:47,210 --> 00:57:48,460
哦 老天
Oh, boy.

738
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:49,750
嘿 玛兹
Hey, Maz.

739
00:57:53,590 --> 00:57:55,550
我的男朋友呢
Where's my boyfriend?

740
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,660
丘伊在千年隼号上工作呢
Chewie's working on the Falcon.

741
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:58,760
我喜欢那个伍基人
I like that Wookiee.

742
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,500
我猜你需要一些什么东西
I assume you need something.

743
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,000
还挺急的
Desperately.

744
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,100
跟我来吧
Let's get to it.

745
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,800
我一会回来
I'll be back.

746
00:58:58,660 --> 00:59:00,120
原谅我
Forgive me.

747
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,450
我又一次感受到了
I feel it again.

748
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,670
光明面的诱惑
The pull to the light.

749
00:59:12,500 --> 00:59:15,010
最高领袖察觉到了
Supreme Leader senses it.

750
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,470
请再次给我展示
Show me again.

751
00:59:17,970 --> 00:59:20,140
黑暗面的力量
The power of the darkness.

752
00:59:21,430 --> 00:59:24,020
我绝不会让任何事情阻挡我们的道路
And I will let nothing stand in our way.

753
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:26,350
给我展示
Show me...

754
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:29,850
祖父大人
Grandfather...

755
00:59:32,320 --> 00:59:34,650
我会完成
and I will finish...

756
00:59:34,780 --> 00:59:36,150
你未尽的事业的
what you started.

757
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,380
一张能找到
A map.

758
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,110
天行者的地图
To Skywalker himself?

759
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:55,950
你是打算重出江湖了
You are right back in the mess.

760
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:59,510
玛兹 我需要你把这个机器人送到莱娅那
Maz, I need you to get this droid to Leia.

761
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:01,340
嗯
Hmm...

762
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,470
不行
No.

763
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:07,850
你已经远离这场战斗太久了
You've been running away from this fight for too long.

764
01:00:08,350 --> 01:00:09,290
汉
Han.

765
01:00:12,020 --> 01:00:13,520
回家吧
Go home.

766
01:00:14,190 --> 01:00:15,470
莱娅不会想见我的
Leia doesn't wanna see me.

767
01:00:15,570 --> 01:00:17,780
拜托 我们来这就是寻求你的帮助的
Please, we came here for your help.

768
01:00:19,030 --> 01:00:20,030
什么战斗
What fight?

769
01:00:21,240 --> 01:00:23,270
唯一的战斗
The only fight.

770
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,520
抵抗黑暗组织
Against the dark side.

771
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:29,160
古往今来 我已经见识过太多的邪恶力量
Through the ages I've seen evil take many forms.

772
01:00:30,250 --> 01:00:32,440
西斯人 帝国军团
The Sith. The Empire.

773
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,880
现在 是第一秩序
Today, it is the First Order.

774
01:00:36,670 --> 01:00:39,590
他们的阴影笼罩着整个银河系
Their shadow is spreading across the galaxy.

775
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,090
我们必须面对他们
We must face them.

776
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:43,260
和他们战斗
Fight them.

777
01:00:43,390 --> 01:00:44,930
我们所有人
All of us.

778
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,120
不能和第一秩序对抗
There is no fight against the First Order.

779
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,350
我们不可能战胜他们
Not one we can win.

780
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:50,790
看看周围
Look around.

781
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:53,270
没机会了 我们早已被认出来了
There's no chance we haven't been recognized already.

782
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,610
我敢打赌第一秩序已经在来的路上了
I bet you the First Order is on their way right...

783
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:57,900
这是什么
What's this?

784
01:00:59,740 --> 01:01:00,740
你干什么
What are you doing?

785
01:01:05,450 --> 01:01:06,950
索洛 她在干什么
Solo, what is she doing?

786
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:08,830
我不知道 但肯定不是好事
I don't know. But it ain't good.

787
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:10,770
如果你活得够久
If you live long enough...

788
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:14,380
就能通过眼睛能看透不同的人
you see the same eyes in different people.

789
01:01:15,290 --> 01:01:19,760
我看到了一个想要逃跑的人
I'm looking at the eyes of a man who wants to run.

790
01:01:22,630 --> 01:01:24,590
你对我一无所知
You don't know a thing about me.

791
01:01:25,930 --> 01:01:28,930
我从哪来 见过什么
Where I'm from. What I've seen.

792
01:01:29,600 --> 01:01:32,270
没人比我更了解第一秩序
You don't know the First Order like I do.

793
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,380
他们会把我们屠杀殆尽
They'll slaughter us.

794
01:01:35,480 --> 01:01:37,610
我们必须逃跑
We all need to run.

795
01:01:46,070 --> 01:01:47,080
看到那两个人了吗
You see those two?

796
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:50,940
他们会把货物运往外环星域交易
They'll trade work for transportation to the Outer Rim.

797
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:53,250
在那 你可以消失
There, you can disappear.

798
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:54,460
芬恩
Finn?

799
01:01:56,880 --> 01:01:57,880
跟我一起走
Come with me.

800
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:00,950
BB-8怎么办 我们还没有完成任务
What about BB-8? We're not done yet.

801
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,720
我们得把它送回你们基地
We have to get him back to your base.

802
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:05,810
你以为呢 他不行的
You think? He can't.

803
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:09,140
我做不到
I can't.

804
01:02:17,940 --> 01:02:19,150
留着吧 孩子
Keep it, kid.

805
01:02:29,410 --> 01:02:30,830
那个女孩是谁
Who's the girl?

806
01:02:31,240 --> 01:02:35,520
- 什么 这是什么 - 让他先说
- What? What is it? - Let him speak first.

807
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,730
有人说你们可以把我带到外环星域
I was told you can get me to the Outer Rim.

808
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,920
你在做什么
What are you doing?

809
01:02:40,670 --> 01:02:41,670
别丢下我
Don't leave without me.

810
01:02:45,510 --> 01:02:47,330
你不能一走了之 我不会让你走的
You can't just go. I won't let you.

811
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:48,490
我不是你想的那样
I'm not who you think I am.

812
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:49,660
芬恩 你在说什么
Finn, what are you talking about?

813
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:50,810
我不是抵抗组织的
I'm not Resistance.

814
01:02:51,510 --> 01:02:53,020
我也不是英雄
I'm not a hero.

815
01:02:56,270 --> 01:02:58,020
我是一个冲锋队员
I'm a stormtrooper.

816
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,110
和他们一样 我从一个永远都不会知道的家庭被带走
Like all of them, I was taken from a family I'll never know.

817
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:04,860
被培养训练去杀戮
And raised to do one thing.

818
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:08,700
在我第一场战斗中 我做了一个选择
But my first battle, I made a choice.

819
01:03:09,870 --> 01:03:11,700
我不想替他们杀人
I wasn't gonna kill for them.

820
01:03:12,370 --> 01:03:15,290
所以我逃跑了 正好遇见了你
So I ran. Right into you.

821
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:18,960
从来没有人像你那样看我
And you looked at me like no one ever had.

822
01:03:21,880 --> 01:03:24,170
我为自己感到羞耻
I was ashamed of what I was.

823
01:03:26,720 --> 01:03:28,720
但是 我受够了第一秩序
But I'm done with the First Order.

824
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:30,640
我永远都不要回去
I'm never going back.

825
01:03:32,720 --> 01:03:34,470
蕾伊 跟我一起走吧
Rey, come with me.

826
01:03:35,560 --> 01:03:36,810
别走
Don't go.

827
01:03:41,980 --> 01:03:43,730
照顾好自己
Take care of yourself.

828
01:03:45,530 --> 01:03:47,200
拜托了
Please.

829
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,990
不要
No!

830
01:04:03,090 --> 01:04:05,250
不要
No!

831
01:04:18,560 --> 01:04:21,440
别走 回来
No! Come back!

832
01:04:22,440 --> 01:04:24,230
不
No!

833
01:04:37,500 --> 01:04:39,560
回来
Come back!

834
01:04:40,290 --> 01:04:42,120
回来
Come back!

835
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:54,300
别走
No!

836
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:47,090
别走
No!

837
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,730
他的能量
Its energy...

838
01:05:52,530 --> 01:05:54,570
- 就在我们周围 - 不要
- ...surrounds us... - No!

839
01:05:54,700 --> 01:05:57,030
束缚着我们
...and binds us...

840
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:05,980
原力将成为
The Force will be...

841
01:06:15,050 --> 01:06:16,550
别走
No!

842
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:18,550
回来
Come back!

843
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,180
安静 小丫头
Quiet, girl.

844
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,060
别走
No!

845
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,650
蕾伊
Rey?

846
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,950
这是你成为绝地武士的第一步
These are your first steps.

847
01:06:39,910 --> 01:06:40,910
刚才那是什么
What was that?

848
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,870
我不该贸然进来的
I shouldn't have gone in there.

849
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:49,570
那是卢克的光剑
That lightsaber was Luke's.

850
01:06:49,670 --> 01:06:51,460
在那之前属于他父亲
And his father's before him.

851
01:06:51,590 --> 01:06:55,220
但是现在 它在召唤你
And now, it calls to you.

852
01:06:55,340 --> 01:06:56,760
我必须要回贾库
I have to get back to Jakku.

853
01:06:57,430 --> 01:06:59,100
汉跟我说了
Han told me.

854
01:07:06,850 --> 01:07:08,880
孩子啊
Dear child.

855
01:07:08,980 --> 01:07:11,010
我从你的眼睛里看出来了
I see your eyes.

856
01:07:11,110 --> 01:07:14,090
你已经知道真相了
You already know the truth.

857
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:16,650
你在贾库等待的人
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku...

858
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,950
他们再也不会回来了
they're never coming back.

859
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:29,630
但是 只有一个人例外
But... there's someone who still could.

860
01:07:32,340 --> 01:07:33,900
卢克
Luke.

861
01:07:34,000 --> 01:07:37,680
你苦苦追寻的归宿不在过去
The belonging you seek is not behind you...

862
01:07:37,800 --> 01:07:39,470
而在未来
it is ahead.

863
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:43,140
我不是绝地武士 但我了解原力
I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.

864

01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,730
芬恩之前在基地工作过 他熟悉
Finn's familiar with the weapon that destroyed the Hosnian system.

1010
01:22:39,830 --> 01:22:40,830
摧毁霍斯尼亚星系的武器
He worked on the base.

1011
01:22:41,330 --> 01:22:43,250
你知道的一切对我们将会非常重要
We're desperate for anything you can tell us.

1012
01:22:43,370 --> 01:22:44,610
我的朋友就被带去那里了
That's where my friend was taken.

1013
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,000
我得尽快赶过去
I've got to get there fast.

1014
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:49,880
我乐意提供一切资源 但你得先把知道的都告诉我们
And I will do everything I can to help but first you need to tell us all you know.

1015
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,590
你一定很痛苦
That sounds very scary.

1016
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,850
你一定很勇敢
You must be so brave.

1017
01:23:01,680 --> 01:23:02,680
长官
General...

1018
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:05,880
我很遗憾的通知您 从BB-8中读取的地图数据
I regret to inform you, but this map recovered from BB-8...

1019
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,460
并不完整
is only partially complete.

1020
01:23:07,560 --> 01:23:11,300
更糟的是 这部分数据无法和数据库中的任何一副地图匹配
And even worse, it matches no charted system on record.

1021
01:23:11,400 --> 01:23:15,110
我们还是无法准确定位卢克的位置
We simply do not have enough information to locate Master Luke.

1022
01:23:16,200 --> 01:23:19,280
我太天真了 居然觉得能把卢克带回家
Can't believe I was so foolish to think I could find Luke and bring him home.

1023
01:23:19,410 --> 01:23:20,520
莱娅
Leia.

1024
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:21,690
别这样
Don't do that.

1025
01:23:21,790 --> 01:23:22,980
怎样
Do what?

1026
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:24,200
什么都别做
Anything.

1027
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:27,500
她就是这样
Princesses.

1028
01:23:27,620 --> 01:23:29,150
我只是想帮忙
I'm trying to be helpful.

1029
01:23:30,340 --> 01:23:31,400
你什么时候帮过忙
When did that ever help?

1030
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:33,210
除了死星那次
And don't say the Death Star.

1031
01:23:40,410 --> 01:23:42,850
R2 我需要你的帮助
R2, I need your help.

1032
01:23:47,460 --> 01:23:48,440
R2 醒醒
Wake up, R2.

1033
01:23:48,440 --> 01:23:49,440
BB-8
BB-8.

1034
01:23:49,560 --> 01:23:51,400
你这么做毫无用处
You're wasting your time.

1035
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,440
他可能有地图数据
He might have the map.

1036
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:55,780
谁都不能肯定R2的备份数据里有剩余的地图信息
It is very doubtful that R2 would have the rest of the map in his backup data.

1037
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:58,050
- 我们不能把它叫醒吗 - 恐怕不能
I am afraid not.

1038
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:02,200
卢克大师走了之后R2-D2就一直处在低电量模式
R2-D2 has been in low-power mode ever since Master Luke went away.

1039
01:24:04,790 --> 01:24:08,040
他可能永远都醒不过来了
Sadly, he may never be his old self again.

1040
01:24:08,560 --> 01:24:09,730
可怜的R2
Poor R2.

1041
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,380
听我说好吗
Listen to me, will you?

1042
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:14,710
我知道每次你
I know every time you...

1043
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,280
每次你看着我 你都会想起他
Every time you look at me you're reminded of him.

1044
01:24:19,380 --> 01:24:21,370
你觉得我能忘掉他吗
You think I want to forget him?

1045
01:24:21,470 --> 01:24:23,140
我希望他回来
I want him back.

1046
01:24:23,260 --> 01:24:25,350
那个时候我们已经尽力了
There's nothing more we could have done.

1047
01:24:27,100 --> 01:24:28,460
他身上有太多外祖父的影子
There's too much Vader in him.

1048
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:31,460
所以我才希望卢克能去训练他
That's why I wanted him to train with Luke.

1049
01:24:31,560 --> 01:24:33,260
我本不该把他送走
I just never should have sent him away.

1050
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:34,940
从那时候起我就失去了他
That's when I lost him.

1051
01:24:36,190 --> 01:24:38,190
我也失去了你
That's when I lost you both.

1052
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,950
我们只能用各自的方式去弥补这件事
We both had to deal with it in our own way.

1053
01:24:43,950 --> 01:24:46,910
我回去做我唯一擅长的事情了
I went back to the only thing I was ever any good at.

1054
01:24:47,500 --> 01:24:48,710
我们都一样
We both did.

1055
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,650
我们再也找不回儿子了
We lost our son.

1056
01:24:52,750 --> 01:24:53,900
永远
Forever.

1057
01:24:54,000 --> 01:24:55,000
不
No.

1058
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,670
是斯诺克的错
It was Snoke.

1059
01:24:57,130 --> 01:24:59,740
他把我们的儿子堕入黑暗
He seduced our son to the dark side.

1060
01:24:59,840 --> 01:25:01,430
但我们还有机会救他
But we can still save him.

1061
01:25:02,140 --> 01:25:03,260
我
Me.

1062
01:25:04,180 --> 01:25:05,220
你
You.

1063
01:25:06,060 --> 01:25:08,380
如果卢克都找不到他 我怎么可能做到
If Luke couldn't reach him, how could I?

1064
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:09,890
卢克是绝地武士
Luke is a Jedi.

1065
01:25:11,480 --> 01:25:12,810
你是他的父亲
You're his father.

1066
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:19,300
我相信他还是心存善念的
There is still light in him, I know it.

1067
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,100
长官
General...

1068
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,700
侦查兵报告敌军来袭
the reconnaissance report on the enemy base is coming.

1069
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:51,520
这是哪里
Where am I?

1070
01:25:53,850 --> 01:25:55,170
这是我的地盘
You're my guest.

1071
01:25:55,270 --> 01:25:56,590
其他人呢
Where are the others?

1072
01:25:56,690 --> 01:25:58,340
你居然把杀手
Do you mean the murderers...

1073
01:25:58,440 --> 01:26:01,320
叛徒 和小偷称作你的朋友
traitors, and thieves you call friends?

1074
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:04,740
你应该庆幸我不知道他们在哪儿
You'll be relieved to hear I have no idea.

1075
01:26:06,740 --> 01:26:08,830
你还是想置我于死地
You still want to kill me.

1076
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:13,290
除非你摘下那个丑陋的面具
That happens when you're being hunted by a creature in a mask.

1077
01:26:38,230 --> 01:26:40,070
跟我说说那个机器人
Tell me about the droid.

1078
01:26:40,900 --> 01:26:44,140
他属于BB系列 由硒电池驱动 带有热扫描器
He's a BB unit with a selenium drive and a thermal hyperscan vindicator.

1079
01:26:44,240 --> 01:26:46,350
携带一部分的地图数据
It's carrying a section of a navigational chart.

1080
01:26:46,450 --> 01:26:47,810
我们有余下的部分
And we have the rest.

1081
01:26:47,910 --> 01:26:50,850
从帝国档案中恢复出来的 但是仍然缺最后一部分
Recovered from the archives of the Empire but we need the last piece.

1082
01:26:50,950 --> 01:26:53,410
你居然说服那个机器人展示给你看了
And somehow you convinced the droid to show it to you.

1083
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:56,040
你
You.

1084
01:26:57,500 --> 01:26:58,750
一个拾荒者
A scavenger.

1085
01:27:01,090 --> 01:27:03,210
你该知道我可以知道任何事
You know I can take whatever I want.

1086
01:27:09,350 --> 01:27:11,260
你太孤单了
You're so lonely.

1087
01:27:13,270 --> 01:27:14,770
害怕离别
So afraid to leave.

1088
01:27:18,940 --> 01:27:21,860
在夜里绝望地入睡
At night, desperate to sleep.

1089
01:27:24,990 --> 01:27:26,570
想象一下大海
You imagine an ocean.

1090
01:27:27,530 --> 01:27:28,820
我看见了
I see it.

1091
01:27:30,070 --> 01:27:31,830
我看见了岛屿
I see the island.

1092
01:27:36,410 --> 01:27:37,710
和汉・索洛
And Han Solo.

1093
01:27:40,040 --> 01:27:42,210
你把他当做从未谋面的父亲
You feel like he's the father you never had.

1094
01:27:42,840 --> 01:27:44,340
他让你失望了
He would have disappointed you.

1095
01:27:44,460 --> 01:27:45,760
把手从我的脑袋上拿开
Get out of my head.

1096
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:48,430
我知道你见过地图了
I know you've seen the map.

1097
01:27:50,010 --> 01:27:51,180
就在你的脑子里
It's in there.

1098
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:53,350
现在你得把它展现给我
And now you'll give it to me.

1099
01:28:01,980 --> 01:28:04,030
别害怕 我能感受到
Don't be afraid. I feel it, too.

1100
01:28:06,490 --> 01:28:08,990
我不会给你展示任何东西的
I'm not giving you anything.

1101
01:28:09,610 --> 01:28:10,700
走着瞧
We'll see.

1102
01:28:50,700 --> 01:28:51,700
你
You.

1103
01:28:52,780 --> 01:28:53,780
你害怕
You're afraid.

1104
01:28:56,830 --> 01:28:59,750
永远都没法和达斯・维德一样强大
That you will never be as strong as Darth Vader.

1105
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:12,490
这个拾荒者 居然能反抗你
The scavenger... resisted you?

1106
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:14,160
她原力亲和力很强
She is strong with the Force.

1107
01:29:14,260 --> 01:29:16,040
虽然没经过训练 但是潜力无穷
Untrained, but stronger than she knows.

1108
01:29:16,140 --> 01:29:17,330
那个机器人呢
And the droid?

1109
01:29:17,430 --> 01:29:20,750
伦觉得它对我们没利用价值了
Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us.

1110
01:29:20,850 --> 01:29:23,480
有那个女孩就够了
That the girl was all we needed.

1111
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:26,050
所以那个机器人应该已经
As a result, the droid has most likely been returned...

1112
01:29:26,150 --> 01:29:27,280
回到敌方的手上了
to the hands of the enemy.

1113
01:29:27,400 --> 01:29:29,090
他们应该已经得到地图了
They may have the map already.

1114
01:29:29,190 --> 01:29:32,930
我们一定要赶在抵抗组织找到天行者之前干掉他们
Then the Resistance must be destroyed before they get to Skywalker.

1115
01:29:33,030 --> 01:29:34,890
我们知道他们的位置
We have their location.

1116
01:29:34,990 --> 01:29:37,620
他们的侦查队回到伊利尼姆星系时被我们追踪了
We tracked their reconnaissance ship to the Ileenium system.

1117
01:29:38,620 --> 01:29:39,900
干得好
Good.

1118
01:29:40,000 --> 01:29:42,860
然后我们要一举消灭他们
Then we will crush them once and for all.

1119
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:44,710
准备好武器
Prepare the weapon.

1120
01:29:45,330 --> 01:29:48,110
最高领袖 我能从那个女孩那里拿到地图数据
Supreme Leader, I can get the map from the girl.

1121
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:50,010
只要您给我一些指引
I just need your guidance.

1122
01:29:51,630 --> 01:29:55,720
如果你说的关于这个女孩的是真的
If what you say about this girl is true...

1123
01:29:56,350 --> 01:30:01,020
把她带来见我
Bring her to me.

1124
01:30:14,990 --> 01:30:17,140
你会替我解开枷锁
You will remove these restraints...

1125
01:30:17,240 --> 01:30:20,330
然后打开门离开这里
and leave this cell with the door open.

1126
01:30:24,080 --> 01:30:25,830
你说什么
What did you say?

1127
01:30:28,750 --> 01:30:33,010
你会替我解开枷锁 然后打开门离开这里
You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.

1128
01:30:39,850 --> 01:30:43,560
我会加固这些枷锁 愚蠢的拾荒者
I'll tighten those restraints, scavenger scum.

1129
01:30:57,870 --> 01:31:01,910
你会替我解开枷锁 然后打开门离开这里
You will remove these restraints and leave this cell with the door open.

1130
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:09,040
我会解开枷锁 然后打开门离开这里
I will remove these restraints and leave the cell with the door open.

1131
01:31:17,970 --> 01:31:21,000
- 你会丢下你的武器 - 我会丢下我的武器
- And you'll drop your weapon. - And I'll drop my weapon.

1132
01:31:33,730 --> 01:31:34,820
不
No.

1133
01:31:35,820 --> 01:31:36,820
不
No.

1134
01:31:38,740 --> 01:31:39,850
警卫
Guards!

1135
01:31:42,410 --> 01:31:43,410
警卫
Guards!

1136
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,650
开始装载武器
Begin charging the weapon.

1137
01:31:50,750 --> 01:31:52,070
好的 长官
Yes, sir.

1138
01:31:52,170 --> 01:31:53,460
武器装载中
Weapon charging.

1139
01:32:12,730 --> 01:32:14,500
斯纳普的侦察飞行器传来的
The scan data from Snap's reconnaissance

1140
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,150
扫描数据证实了芬恩的报告
flight confirms Finn's report.

1141
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:19,610
他们在星球内部建造了某种超光速武器
They've somehow created a hyper-lightspeed weapon built within the planet itself.

1142
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:20,720
激光炮吗
A laser cannon?

1143
01:32:20,820 --> 01:32:22,660
我们不知道怎么形容此种规模的武器
We're not sure how to describe a weapon of this scale.

1144
01:32:22,780 --> 01:32:23,770
又是一颗死星
It's another Death Star.

1145
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:25,600
那么简单就好了 上校
I wish that were the case, Major.

1146
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:26,950
这个是当年的死星
This was the Death Star.

1147
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:32,210
而这个 是弑星者基地
And this is Starkiller Base.

1148
01:32:32,710 --> 01:32:33,860
所以 它很大
So, it's big.

1149
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:37,050
这种规模的武器的能源问题是怎么解决的
How is it possible to power a weapon of that size?

1150
01:32:37,170 --> 01:32:39,300
他们用的是太阳能
It uses the power of the sun.

1151
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:43,870
太阳能会随着武器装载而渐渐耗尽 直到太阳消失
As the weapon is charged the sun is drained until it disappears.

1152
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:44,970
夫人
Ma'am.

1153
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:49,560
第一秩序现在正在重新装载他们的武器
The First Order, they're charging the weapon again now.

1154
01:32:50,520 --> 01:32:52,400
下次目标是我们的星系
Our system is the next target.

1155
01:32:52,520 --> 01:32:53,510
我的天哪
Oh, my.

1156
01:32:53,610 --> 01:32:55,090
没有共和国的舰队帮助 我们就完了
Without the Republic fleet, we're doomed.

1157
01:32:55,190 --> 01:32:56,970
好吧 我们把它炸掉怎么样
Okay. How do we blow it up?

1158
01:32:57,070 --> 01:32:59,390
- 总有办法能做到的 - 汉说的没错
- There's always a way to do that. - Han's right.

1159
01:32:59,490 --> 01:33:02,600
要成功装载规模如此大的武器
In order for that amount of power to be contained...

1160
01:33:02,700 --> 01:33:04,660
基地必须有某种热振荡器
that base has to have some kind of thermal oscillator.

1161
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:06,950
有一个 在第四十七区域
There is one. Precinct 47.

1162
01:33:07,540 --> 01:33:08,770
这里
Here.

1163
01:33:08,870 --> 01:33:10,830
如果我们能毁掉这个振荡器
If we can destroy that oscillator...

1164
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,900
就可能会破坏武器核心 削弱武器力量
it might destabilize the core and cripple the weapon.

1165
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:15,780
- 或许能摧毁星球 - 我们会去那里
- Maybe the planet. - We'll go in there,

1166
01:33:15,880 --> 01:33:17,210
朝振荡器和接触到的一切发起攻击
we'll hit that oscillator with everything we've got.

1167
01:33:17,340 --> 01:33:20,720
他们有战舰无法穿过的保护罩
They have defensive shields that our ships cannot penetrate.

1168
01:33:20,840 --> 01:33:22,240
我们会破坏保护罩
We disable the shields.

1169
01:33:22,340 --> 01:33:24,010
孩子 你在那工作过
Kid, you worked there.

1170
01:33:24,140 --> 01:33:25,120
你知道些什么吗
What do you got?

1171
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:26,410
我可以做到
I can do it.

1172
01:33:26,510 --> 01:33:27,770
我喜欢这家伙
I like this guy.

1173
01:33:27,890 --> 01:33:29,750
我可以关掉保护罩 但我必须在
I can disable the shields, but I have to be there.

1174
01:33:29,850 --> 01:33:31,290
那颗星球上
On the planet.

1175
01:33:31,390 --> 01:33:33,020
- 我们送你去 - 汉 你要怎么做
- We'll get you there. - Han, how?

1176
01:33:33,770 --> 01:33:35,270
如果我告诉你 你不会喜欢的
If I told you, you wouldn't like it.

1177
01:33:35,400 --> 01:33:37,260
所以 我们关掉保护罩
So we disable the shields...

1178
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:39,650
拿下振荡器 然后炸掉大炮
we take out the oscillator and we blow up their big gun.

1179
01:33:41,090 --> 01:33:42,850
好了 走吧
All right. Let's go.

1180
01:34:04,390 --> 01:34:05,870
丘伊 检查一下热能器情况
Chewie, check that donal capitator.

1181
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:07,460
来吧 走了
Come on. Let's go.

1182
01:34:07,560 --> 01:34:09,770
小心点那些东西 那可是炸弹
Finn, be careful with those. They're explosives.

1183
01:34:09,890 --> 01:34:10,930
还要你说啊
Now you tell me?

1184
01:34:11,060 --> 01:34:14,270
你知道吗 不管我们怎么吵架
You know, no matter how much we fought...

1185
01:34:15,690 --> 01:34:18,010
我一直都不喜欢看着你离开
I've always hated watching you leave.

1186
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,320
这就是我做到的原因
That's why I did it.

1187
01:34:20,570 --> 01:34:22,070
所以你会想我的
So you'd miss me.

1188
01:34:24,820 --> 01:34:26,620
我真的很想你
I did miss you.

1189
01:34:28,080 --> 01:34:29,850
也不算很差劲吧 是吗
It wasn't all bad, was it?

1190
01:34:29,950 --> 01:34:31,020
嗯
Huh?

1191
01:34:31,120 --> 01:34:34,250
有时候还是... 挺好的
Some of it was... good.

1192
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:36,080
非常好
Pretty good.

1193
01:34:39,420 --> 01:34:42,300
- 有些事情是不会变的 - 是啊
- Some things never change. - True.

1194
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:44,840
你还是让我疯狂
You still drive me crazy.

1195
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:55,940
如果你见到我们的儿子
If you see our son...

1196
01:34:58,440 --> 01:35:00,110
带他回家
bring him home.

1197
01:35:05,530 --> 01:35:08,180
长官 718号机库传感器被触发
Sir, sensors triggered in Hangar 718.

1198
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:09,930
我们在搜索这个区域
We're searching the area.

1199
01:35:10,030 --> 01:35:12,160
她才刚开始试验自己的力量
She's just beginning to test her powers.

1200
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:15,710
越晚找到她 她就越危险
The longer it takes to find her the more dangerous she becomes.

1201
01:35:20,800 --> 01:35:22,410
所有哨兵机器人
All sentry droids...

1202
01:35:22,510 --> 01:35:26,030
所有哨兵机器人 重新同步银河标准时间
all sentry droids, resynchronize to Galactic Standard Time.

1203
01:35:26,130 --> 01:35:28,140
时间偏移473
Offset 473.

1204
01:35:30,890 --> 01:35:31,970
我们要怎么进去
How are we getting in?

1205
01:35:32,100 --> 01:35:34,040
他们的保护罩有极小的刷新率
Their shields have a fractional refresh rate.

1206
01:35:34,140 --> 01:35:37,310
能阻止所有慢于光速的飞行器通过
Keeps anything traveling slower than lightspeed from getting through.

1207
01:35:37,900 --> 01:35:39,980
我们要以光速着陆吗
We're making our landing approach at lightspeed?

1208
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:42,530
丘伊 做好准备
Chewie, get ready.

1209
01:35:43,820 --> 01:35:44,990
就是现在
And... Now!

1210
01:35:49,420 --> 01:35:51,580
我已经在提升高度了
I am pulling up!

1211
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:00,970
再高一点他们就会发现我们了
I get any higher...they'll see us!

1212
01:36:22,190 --> 01:36:24,570
长官 718号机库没有找到她
Sir, she was not found in Hangar 718.

1213
01:36:24,690 --> 01:36:25,760
但所有部队都戒严了
But all troops are on alert.

1214
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,240
把所有的机库都锁定
Put every hangar on lockdown.

1215
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:29,030
她会想要偷一搜战舰逃跑的
She's going to try to steal a ship to esc...

1216
01:36:31,660 --> 01:36:33,200
汉・索洛
Han Solo.

1217
01:36:44,420 --> 01:36:46,110
翻过山脊就是导流洞了
The flooding tunnel is over that ridge.

1218
01:36:46,210 --> 01:36:47,450
我们从那边进去
We'll get in that way.

1219
01:36:47,550 --> 01:36:49,450
你在基地里的工作是什么
What was your job when you were based here?

1220
01:36:49,550 --> 01:36:50,550
清洁卫生
Sanitation.

1221
01:36:53,430 --> 01:36:55,120
你是清洁工
Sanitation?

1222
01:36:55,220 --> 01:36:56,930
那你怎么知道怎么关掉保护罩
Then how do you know how to disable the shields?

1223
01:36:57,060 --> 01:36:58,060
我不知道
I don't.

1224
01:36:58,180 --> 01:36:59,940
我是来这救蕾伊的
I'm just here to get Rey.

1225
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:03,630
大家都指望着我们 整个银河系也指望着我们呢
People are counting on us. The galaxy is counting on us.

1226
01:37:03,730 --> 01:37:05,070
索洛 我们会找到方法的
Solo, we'll figure it out.

1227
01:37:06,030 --> 01:37:07,440
我们可以使用原力
We'll use the Force.

1228
01:37:07,570 --> 01:37:09,640
原力不是这样用的
That's not how the Force works.

1229
01:37:10,000 --> 01:37:11,240
我好冷
I'm cold.

1230
01:37:11,240 --> 01:37:13,780
是吗 你还冷吗
Oh, really? You're cold?

1231
01:37:13,950 --> 01:37:14,950
走吧
Come on.

1232
01:37:22,370 --> 01:37:23,650
报告
Report.

1233
01:37:23,750 --> 01:37:25,960
武器还有十五分钟装载成功 长官
Weapon charged in 15 minutes, sir.

1234
01:37:28,420 --> 01:37:29,420
嘿
Hey!

1235
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:34,800
我们呆的时间越长 运气就越差
The longer we're here the less luck we're gonna have.

1236
01:37:34,930 --> 01:37:37,430
- 保护罩 - 我有个想法
- The shields. - I have an idea about that.

1237
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,840
- 还记得我吗 - FN-2187
- You remember me? - FN-2187.

1238
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:49,190
不再是了
Not anymore.

1239
01:37:49,360 --> 01:37:50,680
我叫芬恩 现在由我做主
The name's Finn and I'm in charge.

1240
01:37:50,780 --> 01:37:52,810
现在由我做主了 法斯玛 由我做主
I'm in charge now, Phasma. I'm in charge.

1241
01:37:52,910 --> 01:37:54,890
- 别激动 别激动 - 好
- Bring it down. Bring it down. - Yeah.

1242
01:37:54,990 --> 01:37:56,120
跟我来
Follow me.

1243
01:38:09,300 --> 01:38:10,740
你是否见过新的T-17S
Have you checked out the new T-17s?

1244
01:38:10,840 --> 01:38:13,680
我敢说T-17S有了很大的改进
The T-17s, as far as I can tell are a great improvement.

1245
01:38:13,800 --> 01:38:15,640
是啊 这就是他们会告诉你的
Yeah. That's what they tell you.

1246
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:16,970
但是相信我 他们撑不起来
But believe me, they don't hold up.

1247
01:38:17,100 --> 01:38:18,600
- 他们不行吗 - 不行
- They don't? - No.

1248
01:38:54,300 --> 01:38:56,040
你想要我把你头上那个铁桶打下来吗
You want me to blast that bucket off your head?

1249
01:38:56,140 --> 01:38:57,240
关掉保护罩
Lower the shields.

1250
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:59,180
你正在犯下一个滔天大错
You're making a big mistake.

1251
01:38:59,310 --> 01:39:01,390
照做
Do it.

1252
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:09,090
索洛 如果这事有效 我们就没有多少时间去找蕾伊了
Solo, if this works, we're not gonna have a lot of time to find Rey.

1253
01:39:09,190 --> 01:39:10,570
别担心 孩子
Don't worry, kid.

1254
01:39:11,360 --> 01:39:12,760
没找到她我们是不会离开这里的
We won't leave here without her.

1255
01:39:14,570 --> 01:39:17,430
你不会那么蠢的相信这事会这么容易吧
You can't be so stupid as to think this will be easy.

1256
01:39:17,530 --> 01:39:20,100
我的部队马上就会到这片区域来杀掉你们
My troops will storm this block and kill you all.

1257
01:39:20,200 --> 01:39:22,040
我不同意 我们怎么处理她
I disagree. What do we do with her?

1258
01:39:22,660 --> 01:39:24,200
这里有垃圾倾倒槽吗
Is there a garbage chute?

1259
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:26,210
垃圾压缩机呢
Trash compactor?

1260
01:39:27,370 --> 01:39:28,460
有的
Yeah, there is.

1261
01:39:28,790 --> 01:39:30,320
将军 保护罩失效了
General, their shields are down.

1262
01:39:30,420 --> 01:39:31,990
感谢造物主
Thank the Maker!

1263
01:39:32,090 --> 01:39:33,820
汉做到了 派他们进去
Han did it. Send them in.

1264
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,820
让波全权负责进攻
Give Poe full authorization for attack.

1265
01:39:35,920 --> 01:39:38,200
黑队组长 速度降到亚光速
Black Leader, go to sub-lights on your call.

1266
01:39:38,300 --> 01:39:39,290
收到 基地
Roger, base.

1267
01:39:39,390 --> 01:39:41,100
红队 蓝队 听我指令
Red squad, Blue squad, take my lead.

1268
01:39:42,030 --> 01:39:43,880
将速度降到光速以下
Dropping out of lightspeed.

1269
01:39:57,070 --> 01:39:58,570
快到射程内了
Almost in range.

1270
01:39:58,740 --> 01:40:01,480
尽全力击中致命点
Hit the target dead center. As many runs as we can get.

1271
01:40:01,580 --> 01:40:03,450
接近目标
Approaching target.

1272
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:08,870
敌机来袭
Fighters incoming!

1273
01:40:09,750 --> 01:40:11,320
即将在28.336
Coming at 28.336.

1274
01:40:11,420 --> 01:40:13,200
四十五 开启保护罩 开启保护罩
Forty-five! Shields up! Shields up!

1275
01:40:13,300 --> 01:40:14,960
派出所有舰队
Dispatch all squadrons.

1276
01:40:15,090 --> 01:40:16,590
好的 将军
Yes, General.

1277
01:40:17,420 --> 01:40:18,430
好了 把它点燃吧
All right. Let's light it up.

1278
01:40:28,190 --> 01:40:30,250
- 直接命中 - 但没有损坏
- Ah, direct hit. - But no damage!

1279
01:40:30,350 --> 01:40:31,610
我们得持续攻击
Yeah, we gotta keep hitting it.

1280
01:40:31,770 --> 01:40:33,070
又一轮轰炸要来了
Another bombing run.

1281
01:40:33,190 --> 01:40:35,880
记住 太阳消失时 他们的武器就装载成功要发射了
Remember, when the sun is gone that weapon will be ready to fire.

1282
01:40:35,980 --> 01:40:38,570
但只要还有一丝光线 我们就有机会
But as long as there's light, we got a chance.

1283
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:40,280
波主人 敌机
Master Poe, enemy fighters!

1284
01:40:40,280 --> 01:40:41,820
伙计们 有很多客人来了
Guys, we got a lot of company!

1285
01:40:48,460 --> 01:40:50,070
我们认为他们可能会分开行动

1286
01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:52,130
前往第四和第五战区

1287
01:40:59,970 --> 01:41:01,950
我们要利用机会把防爆门炸了
We'll use the charges to blow that blast door.

1288
01:41:02,050 --> 01:41:04,790
我去吸引火力 但我需要你的掩护
I'll go in and draw fire, but I'm gonna need cover.

1289
01:41:04,890 --> 01:41:05,960
你确定你要这么做吗
You sure you're up for this?

1290
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:07,250
当然不确定
Hell, no.

1291
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:08,630
我进去找蕾伊
I'll go in and try to find Rey.

1292
01:41:08,730 --> 01:41:09,920
部队肯定会跟在我们后面
The troopers will be on our tail.

1293
01:41:10,020 --> 01:41:12,130
我们必须做好准备
We have to be ready for that.

1294
01:41:12,230 --> 01:41:14,010
那边还有入口隧道可以通往...

1295
01:41:14,110 --> 01:41:16,630
你这是干什么 你这样干嘛
Why are you doing that? Hmm? Why are you doing this?

1296
01:41:16,730 --> 01:41:18,070
我在做计划呢
I'm trying to come up with a plan.

1297

你怎么样了 他伤到你了吗
What happened to you? Did he hurt you?

1301
01:41:39,840 --> 01:41:41,220
芬恩 你来这干什么
Finn, what are you doing here?

1302
01:41:41,340 --> 01:41:43,430
我们是来救你的
We came back for you.

1303
01:41:44,300 --> 01:41:45,830
他说什么
What'd he say?

1304
01:41:45,930 --> 01:41:47,310
他说这都是你的主意
That it was your idea.

1305
01:41:51,100 --> 01:41:52,190
谢谢
Thank you.

1306
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:57,630
你是怎么跑出来的
How did you get away?

1307
01:41:57,730 --> 01:41:58,760
我没法解释
I can't explain it.

1308
01:41:58,860 --> 01:42:00,930
你也不会相信的
And you wouldn't believe it.

1309
01:42:01,030 --> 01:42:03,360
现在要跑了 等会再抱吧
Escape now, hug later.

1310
01:42:18,550 --> 01:42:20,090
我后面跟了一架敌机
I got one behind me.

1311
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:21,590
- 看到了吗 - 看到了
- You see it? - Yeah. I'm on it.

1312
01:42:30,220 --> 01:42:32,060
- 布利偌被击中了 - 小心地面的火力

他们有麻烦了
They're in trouble.

1314
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:40,440
我们还不能走
We can't leave.

1315
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:45,220
我的朋友带着一整包炸弹呢
My friend's got a bag full of explosives.

1316
01:42:45,320 --> 01:42:46,970

Let's use them.

1317
01:42:47,070 --> 01:42:48,450
将军 你看到了吗
General, are you seeing this?

1318
01:42:48,580 --> 01:42:49,890
又有两架X翼战机被击落了
Two more X-wings down.

1319
01:42:49,990 --> 01:42:52,350
我们舰队一半战舰都被摧毁了
That's half our fleet destroyed.

1320
01:42:52,450 --> 01:42:55,110
他们的武器十分钟内就要装载成功了
And their weapon will be fully charged in ten minutes.

1321
01:42:55,210 --> 01:42:57,330
只有奇迹发生才能救我们了
It would take a miracle to save us now.

1322
01:43:23,780 --> 01:43:24,760
啊
Ah.

1323
01:43:24,860 --> 01:43:27,200
那姑娘有一套啊
Girl knows her stuff.

1324
01:43:36,160 --> 01:43:38,610
隔一根柱子设置一个炸弹
We'll set the charges against every other column.

1325
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:41,780
你说对了 这确实是个更好的主意
You're right. That's a better idea.

1326
01:43:41,880 --> 01:43:43,860
你负责上面 我负责下面
You take the top. I'll go down below.

1327

1332
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:54,050
我等这一天已经很久了
I've been waiting for this day for a long time.

1333
01:46:13,320 --> 01:46:16,830
摘下那个面具 你并不需要它
Take off that mask. You don't need it.

1334
01:46:17,410 --> 01:46:19,290
如果我摘下面具 你觉得你会看到什么
What do you think you'll see if I do?

1335
01:46:19,410 --> 01:46:21,660
我儿子的脸
The face of my son.

1336
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:45,690
你儿子已经死了
Your son is gone.

1337
01:46:46,980 --> 01:46:49,320
他跟他的父亲一样虚弱又愚蠢
He was weak and foolish like his father.

1338
01:46:49,480 --> 01:46:51,230
所以我毁了他
So I destroyed him.

1339
01:46:53,320 --> 01:46:55,700
这就是斯诺克想要你相信的
That's what Snoke wants you to believe.

1340
01:46:56,950 --> 01:46:58,660
但这不是真的
But it's not true.

1341
01:46:59,990 --> 01:47:02,060
我的儿子还活着
My son is alive.

1342

不
No.

1343

最高领袖是明智的
The Supreme Leader is wise.

1344
01:47:06,000 --> 01:47:08,740
斯诺克只是在利用你的力量

1345
01:47:08,840 --> 01:47:10,630
等他得到想要的东西 他就会杀了你
When he gets what he wants, he'll crush you.

1346
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,550
你知道的
You know it's true.

1347
01:47:23,180 --> 01:47:24,170
太晚了
It's too late.

1348
01:47:24,270 --> 01:47:25,840
不 并不晚
No, it's not.

1349
01:47:25,940 --> 01:47:27,690
跟我离开这里 跟我回家
Leave here with me. Come home.

1350

我们很想你
We miss you.

1351
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:41,700
我很矛盾

我想摆脱这种痛苦

我知道我必须要做什么
I know what I have to do,

1354
01:47:53,560 --> 01:47:55,380
但我不知道 我是否有勇气做到
but I don't know if I have the strength to do it.

1355
01:47:59,300 --> 01:48:00,370
你会帮我吗
Will you help me?

1356
01:48:00,470 --> 01:48:02,310
是的 不论何事
Yes. Anything.

振荡器已经损坏 但还在运作中
The oscillator's been damaged but is still functional.

1361
01:50:28,950 --> 01:50:31,450

千年隼在这边
The Falcon's this way.

1363
01:51:05,070 --> 01:51:06,410
我们还没玩完呢
We're not done yet.

1364
01:51:09,580 --> 01:51:11,410
你是个怪物
You're a monster.

1365
01:51:11,540 --> 01:51:13,410
现在只有我们了
It's just us now.

我们已经不堪重负了
