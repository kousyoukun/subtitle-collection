00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:30,375
战斗的狂飙突击是一种瘾，强效而致命
因为战争本身是种毒品 - 《纽约时报》记者克里斯・赫奇斯

2
00:00:30,375 --> 00:00:32,958
战争本身就是毒品

00:00:53,462 --> 00:00:56,813
巴格达

4
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:18,849
走，快走
Go, go!

5
00:01:50,208 --> 00:01:51,789
(移动式机器人)

6
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,991
靠近目标
Approaching.

7
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,886
我想这回应该是个真家伙
I think we have touchdown.

8
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:11,660
- 往右一点    - 好的，向右
Little to the right

9
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:34,499
你好啊，老妈
Hello mum

10
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:39,938
好了，往里面捅
Now, push it in

11
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:44,201
不行啊
I can't

12
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:45,986
不行个屁 就把它当成你的老二，往前推
What do you mean you can't? Pretend it's your dick, man.

13
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:48,434
不如我把它当成是你的老二
How about I pretend it's your dick?

14
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,940
那你就别想完事了
You'll never get in if you did that.

15
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:53,190
- 我来试试    - 再等一会儿
- Here, let me have a shot.    - Give me a second,

16
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:55,871
- 少来，让开    - 这是我的老二    - 给你
- No, come on    - My dick, man    - Go

17
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:02,861
操性
Fucker

18
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:07,866
- 拿住了    - 嗯
- Got that    - Yeah

19
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,620
开场了
Here we go

20
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,990
- 好家伙     - 好正的T155啊     - 是啊
- Oh, look at that     - Nice 155, huh?     - Yeah

21
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:23,969
这玩意儿要是炸了，可了不得
It's going to do some fucking damage.

22
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:27,219
喂，艾缀奇，看来需要来一次引爆
Hey, Eldridge, looks like we're going to need a charge!

23
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:28,484
收到
I got that.

24
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:32,140
我估计用四盒就能产生20磅当量了
Figured four blocks that'll give us about 20 pounds of bang total.

25
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:34,910
爆炸波会一直冲到那儿
That blast is going to roast straight out there.

26
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,610
弹壳可能会飞到那个地方
The shell will probably kick out there, and most of the shrapnel

27
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:40,069
其他零散的弹片会像天女散花一样
is going to shoot straight up in a beautiful umbrella pattern.

28
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:40,984
没错
Yep

29
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:44,531
还有些碎弹片会飞向我们这边
We're gonna get some smaller pieces and shell fragments this way,

30
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:46,576
只要站在军用悍马后面应该没啥问题
but we'll be okay if we're behind the Humvee,

31
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:48,882
- 把机器人叫回来，准备引爆    - 好的
- Bring the bot back, we'll load it up.    - No problem.

32
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:53,303
机器人正在返回
Bot is moving.

33
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:09,861
艾缀奇，报告情况
Let me know what you got, Eldridge.

34
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:11,058
已经准备好了
Good to go.

35
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:13,996
好，让小车上路
All right, wagon's set up. Bot moves.

36
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:18,399
啊哦，半路杀出一帮山羊
Uh-oh, we got goats, guys!

37
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:20,522
注意，12点钟方向出现羊群
Goats 12:00, Watch out,

38
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,733
弹药上膛…
Load them little bastards up.

39
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:40,976
- 哦，该死    - 该死
- Oh, shit,    - Shit,

40
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:43,997
他娘的
Oh, fuck!

41
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:46,218
小车倒了怎么推哟
Wagon's having a bad day, boys.

42
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:48,483
- 是你造的？    - 不，是美国陆军造的
- You build that?    - No, the U.S. Army did,

43
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:50,702
好，看来得我去搞定
All right, looks like I'm going down there

44
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:52,766
这么美丽的小区，不想再流连一会儿？
You don't like waiting around this beautiful neighborhood?

45
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:53,889
哦，真喜欢这儿啊
Oh, I love it.

46
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:06,276
如果一切顺利，我过去之后
So, if everything looks okay, when I get down there

47
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,524
把那玩意儿设好，然后引爆
I'm just going to set it up and bip it,

48
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,664
让这些家伙明白明白
Give these people something to think about,

49
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,454
既然要在我们前进的路上放炸弹
Want them to know if they're gonna leave a bomb on the side of the road for us,

50
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,205
我们只好把他们的路炸开
we're just going to blow up their little fuckin' road,

51
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,203
有理
Sounds good

52
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:19,585
我想吃汉堡了，是不是有些怪？
Craving a burger; is that strange?

53
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,542
- 你这么说，不觉得奇怪    - 那好
- Not for you    - No, okay

54
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,043
戴上头盔
Helmet on

55
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,337
祝旅途愉快
Happy trails

56
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:35,225
我是拆弹1号，能听见么
Blaster One, can you read me?

57
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,599
收到，拆弹1号，你可以出发了
Roger that, Blaster one. You're good to go.

58
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,065
拆弹1号，你看上去很棒
You're looking good, Blaster One.

59
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:06,628
好是好，就是热
Nice and hot in here.

60
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:14,795
150
One fifty

61
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,055
收到，150米
Roger that, 150 meters

62
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:31,992
喂
Hi!

63
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:34,159
- 你们从哪儿来？    - 且慢
- Where are you from?    - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

64
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:35,824
- 你们从哪儿来？从哪儿来的？    - 停下
Where are you from? Where are you from?    - Stop!

65
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,121
加利福尼亚？
California?

66
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:38,560
- 走开，伙计    - 是哪儿呢？
- Hey, get out of here, man    - Where?

67
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:41,121
没功夫和你闲聊，快走开！
Hey, this ain't no fuckin' meet and greet. Now get out of here.

68
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:42,789
快点
Now

69
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,044
走开
Go!

70
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,904
又认识新朋友啦，桑伯恩？
You making friends again, Sanborn?

71
00:06:58,272 --> 00:06:59,614
整天都在认识
All day long

72
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:07,881
25
Twenty-five

73
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:11,460
25米，收到，你已进入死亡区域
Twenty-five meters, Roger that You are now in the kill zone.

74
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:14,990
谢谢提醒
Thanks for reminding me.

75
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:17,257
我就是干这个的
That's what I'm here for, baby.

76
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,576
好吧
Okay.

77
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,628
引爆装置没坏
The debts look good.

78
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:31,547
收到
Roger that.

79
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:03,637
现在放引爆器
I'm laying on the charge.

80
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:05,914
小心轻放
Nice and sweet.

81
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:09,126
一切就绪
We're good to go.

82
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:10,993
现在返回
I'm coming back.

83
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,425
- 已经走出5米    - 5米，收到
- Five meters out.    - Five meters, Roger that.

84
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:17,805
桑伯恩
Hey, Sanborn

85
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,571
- 知道这儿缺什么嘛    - 说说看
- You know what this place needs?    - I'm listening.

86
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:23,181
缺草皮
Needs grass

87
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,605
我们该在这儿卖草皮？
We gonna start our grass business?

88
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,853
没错，伙计
That's right, man.

89
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:31,990
我来卖草皮，你去修草坪
I'm going to sell the grass, you're going to cut it.

90
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,419
公司名就叫“桑伯恩子弟”
It's going to be called ''Sanborn and Sons'',

91
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,422
我们会发财的
We'll be rich.

92
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:43,118
这点子我喜欢 马唐(杂草名)，钝叶草…
I like that, crabgrass, St. Augustine, man.

93
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:44,890
这方面我是行家
I'm a scholar on this shit,

94
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:49,808
不如这样，你卖草，我种草
How about this? You sell it, I fertilize it.

95
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:53,670
- 25    - 25米，收到
- 25    - 25 meters, Roger that

96
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:55,255
桑伯恩！
Sanborn!

97
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:58,300
2点钟方向有家肉店，老板拿着手机！
Butcher shop, 2:00! dude has a phone!

98
00:08:58,434 --> 00:08:59,676
艾缀奇为啥要跑？
Why is Eldridge running?

99
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:02,763
- 命令他放下手机！    - 放下手机！
- Make him put it down!    - Put down the phone!

100
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,598
快点，伙计们，告诉我怎么了
Come on, guys, talk to me,

101
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,334
手机扔掉！手机扔掉！
Drop the phone! Drop your phone!

102
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,815
开枪打他，艾缀奇，射他！
Hey, burn him, Eldridge! Burn him!

103
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,481
- 放下手机    - 艾缀奇，打他！
- Put down the cell phone!    - Eldridge, burn him!

104
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:14,194
- 让开    - 交出你的手机！
- Get out of the way,    - Drop your phone!

105
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,376
命令他放下手机！ 去拿过来！
Make him put it down! Go get it!

106
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:19,755
- 快点，艾缀奇！    - 我不能开枪
- Come on, Eldridge!    - I can't get him shot!

107
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:37,406
汤普森！
Thompson!

108
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,250
[ 美国陆军 马修・汤普森中士]

109
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:07,786
放哪儿都行
Anywhere's good,

110
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:31,368
- 都在这儿了？    - 是
- Is that everything?    - Yeah,

111
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:08,430
谁啊？
Yeah?

112
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:13,977
进来
Come in.

113
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:17,664
詹姆斯上士！
Sergeant James?

114
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,823
我是J.T.桑伯恩
JT Sanborn, man.

115
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:24,867
你好，我叫威尔
Hey! Hi, how are you? Will.

116
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:26,952
欢迎来胜利营B连！
Welcome to Bravo Company; welcome to Camp Victory,

117
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:29,621
胜利营？我应该在自由营…
Camp Victory? I thought this was Camp Liberty,

118
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,499
哦，名字是一周前换的
Oh! No, they changed that about a week ago.

119
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:33,914
胜利听上去更顺耳
Victory sounds better.

120
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:37,421
- 好吧，至少我没走错地方    - 没错
- All right. Well, at least I'm in the right place, right?    - Yeah,

121
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:39,465
既然你来了，能帮我搭把手吗？
While you're here, can you help me move this thing real quick?

122
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,549
没问题
Yeah, no problem.

123
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:42,676
也许你不该把它扒下来
Maybe you shouldn't take this down.

124
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,303
晚上常有迫击炮袭击
We get a lot of mortars at night.

125
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:47,598
窗口这些夹板可以挡住侧飞的弹片
The plywood on the windows help with the lateral fray coming through.

126
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:48,766
所以才装在这儿
That's why it's up there.

127
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:51,352
要是榴弹从天花板飞下来
Yeah, well, it's not going to stop a mortar round

128
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:53,016
这东西就没用了
from coming in through the roof, you know.

129
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:56,453
而且我喜欢阳光
Besides, I like the sunshine.

130
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:59,818
汤姆森的事我听说了，真遗憾
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson.

131
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:03,072
- 我知道他拆弹很在行    - 是的
- I know he was a good tech.    - Yeah, he was,

132
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:04,656
他带队也很在行
He was a great team leader, too,

133
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:07,618
我没想做个完美的接班人
Yeah, I'm not trying to fill his shoes or anything,

134
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,549
我只想…只想尽力而为
I'm just... I'm just going to do my best.

135
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,578
- 明白    - 那好
- Appreciate it,    - All right.

136
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:14,162
好得很
Cool

137
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,042
还是自己的窝最好啊
Home sweet home, right?

138
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:29,094
看到我军在这儿停了这么多坦克 你笑得出来么？
Aren't you glad the Army has all these tanks parked here?

139
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:32,099
就为了提防俄国佬来袭 到时候大家来一场坦克大战
Just in case the Russians come we have to have a big tank battle.

140
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:36,063
我宁愿备着这些坦克，以防万一 有总比没有好
I'd rather be on the side with the tanks, just in case, rather than not have them.

141
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:37,603
是，但这些家伙根本没用
Yeah, but they don't do anything.

142
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,789
如果有人朝这悍马车跑过来 我们就死定了
Anyone comes alongside a Humvee we're dead.

143
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:43,166
如果有人奇怪地看着你，我们就死定了
Anybody even looks at you funny we're dead,

144
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:46,115
差不多可以这么说 如果你来伊拉克，你就死定了
Pretty much the bottom line is if you're in Iraq, you're dead.

145
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,908
这鸟坦克能救你的小命么？
How's a fuckin' tank supposed to stop that?

146
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:50,716
- 欧文，能不能闭嘴？    - 抱歉
- Would you shut up, Owen please?    - Sorry

147
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,928
我只是想吓吓新人
Just trying to scare the new guy.

148
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:55,846
在阿富汗的时候我也见识过
I saw a little bit in Afghanistan, too.

149
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:04,375
[ 距B连轮值结束日还有38天 ]

150
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,524
- 到外面看看路况，艾缀奇    - 收到
- Get your eyes on the road, Eldridge.    - Copy that

151
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:14,806
让开！
Yalla!

152
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:16,183
让开！
Move!

153
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:42,417
(保持100米车距，否则开枪射击)

154
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,267
拆弹一号，我是胜利总部
Blaster One, this is Victory Main.

155
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:57,824
是否抵达座标10-20？完毕
Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over.

156
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:09,461
那些叫我们来的家伙都去哪儿了？
Where the hell are the guys who called this in?

157
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:28,547
胜利总部，我是拆弹迈克
Victory Main, Victory Main, this is Blaster Mike.

158
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:31,733
地点似乎不对，是否有更新信息？完毕
Interrogative, do you have an update on position? Over.

159
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:40,675
我是胜利总部，座标位于3、4、5、3
Victory Main, figures to follow, Three-four-five-three is your grid.

160
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:49,905
我现在就站在这鬼地方 但不见任何需援助人员
Well, that's exactly where the hell I am and I don't see anybody in fatigues,

161
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,337
稍等，正在确定坐标
Give us a second to confirm.

162
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:54,368
留神脚下
Watch your feet!

163
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:58,076
查看座标…3…4…5…3…完毕
Set visual is three-four five-three,

164
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,998
看到悍马车了
Got the Humvee

165
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:04,666
友军！
Friendly!

友军！
Friendly!

167
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:27,397
啊，在这儿
Ah, here we go.

168
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:30,529
他们弃车了
They abandoned their vehicle.

169
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:32,998
詹姆斯，这儿有辆悍马，但里面没人
We got an empty Humvee over here, James.

170
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:35,280
嗯，我知道了
Yeah, I got it.

171

Let's move.

- Morning, boys.    - Sir.

174
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,089
别告诉我炸弹和你们在一起
Don't tell me the bomb's in here with you guys.

175
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:55,175
- 借一步，我告诉你发生了什么    - 好
- Step out and I'll show you what's going on    - All right

176
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:57,453
那个街区往前20米
Down on that block 20 meters.

177
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,558
在清真寺这边，路的东边
This side of the mosque. east side of the street.

178
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:01,560
我们的线人说他看到一堆引线
our informant says he saw a pair of wires

179
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,145
线头埋在一个碎石堆里
going into a rubble pile

180
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,060
- 很可能是土制炸弹    - 恩
- It's a possible IED.    - Yeah

181
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:07,025

182
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,984

- I'll handle it.    - Do you want to talk him or...    - No.

183
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:11,583
好 带着你的兄弟靠后站 由我们来处理 谢谢
Good, Keep your boys back, We'll be good, Thank you,

184
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,114
技术兵，把悍马车开过来
Specialist, bring up the Humvee,

185
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:14,948
怎么了？
What's going on?

186
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,463
我要穿上拆弹服
I'm going to break out the suit.

187
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:19,950
- 那机器人呢？    - 我来就好了
- What about the bot?    - I'll take care of it.

188
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:22,082
不想让机器人先去看看情况？
Don't you want to send the bot down there to see what it looks like?

189
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,165
我去搞定就行
I'll handle it.

190
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,514
詹姆斯，那儿的情况似乎不妙啊
That's kind of tight down here, James.

191
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:42,097
准备好了？
Ready?

192
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:46,935
没问题吧？
Good?

193
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,077
你没必要自己去，有机器人可以代劳
You don't have to go down there, We already have the bot halfway up.

194
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:01,325
没事
I'll be all right.

195
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:15,772
今天第一天，你想来个轻松的，对不对？
First day, figure you want to take it easy, right?

196

好吧，我们上路
All right. Let's rock and roll, man.

200
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:00,300
- 真是个急躁的小子    - 是鲁莽
- He's a rowdy boy    - He's reckless

201
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:14,873
拆弹1号，发生了什么事情？
Blaster One, what's going on?

202
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,985
拆弹1号！你在搞什么？
Blaster One! What are you doing?

203
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,367
拆弹1号，这里是拆弹迈克

这路上的烟是怎么回事，完毕
What's with the smoke on the side of the road?

205
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,813
嘿詹姆斯，能听见吗？
Hey, James, can you hear me?

206
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:31,331
这路上的烟是怎么回事，完毕
What's going on with the smoke on the side of the road? Over

207
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,962
我在声东击西
Creating a diversion

208
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,460
对谁？你发现威胁了？
From what? Is there a threat?

209
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,963
艾缀奇，上墙，快点！
Eldridge, get up on the wall, Move!

210
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,092
看到什么了，技术兵？
Tell me what you see, specialist

211
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,220
哦，我看到他了
All right, I got him

212
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:46,725
他正走出射程
He's walking down range.

213
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,395
詹姆斯，烟雾完全阻挡了视线
James, the smoke is killing my visibility.

214
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,328
你和那炸弹差多远？到没到100米？
Where are you in relationship to the IED? Are you within 100 meters yet?

215
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:57,557
我怎么知道 如果踩到了炸弹，我会告诉你的
Hell, I don't know, but I'll tell you when I'm standing over it, cowboy.

216
00:19:34,194 --> 00:19:35,729
注意掩护！
Take cover!

217
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,446
哦，不，有辆车停在他面前，桑伯恩！
Oh, no, A car stopped in front of him, Sanborn.

218
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:47,286
该死，詹姆斯！詹姆斯，快回来，快
Shit, James! James, come back now.

EOD pulled a nine on this Haji in a car.

220
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:53,764
要派增援吗？
Want me to send backup?

221
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:55,499
我对付就行了
I got it.

222
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:57,960
- 桑切斯，海耶斯！    - 不要，不要
- Sanchez, Hayes!    - Negative! Negative!

223
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:59,214
留在原地
Stand down

224
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,296
爆炸会波及大片街区
The blast will come up the block

225
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:03,135
呆在街角别动
Stay clear around the corner

226
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,176
这儿由排爆小组负责，完毕
EOD has the situation under control, over

227
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:09,863
- 你要上哪儿去？    - 没有我命令，不许开枪！
- Where you going?    - Hold your fire on my command!

228
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:12,099
想倒车吗？
Want to back up?

229
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:18,564
下车！
Get out of the car!

230
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,775
- 下车！    - 快点!
- Get out of the car!    - Come on!

231
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:27,464
你他妈想干嘛？
What the fuck are you doing?

232
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:31,785
往后退！
Back up!

233
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,291
喂？
Hello?

234

想退回去么？
Want to get back?

235
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,330
往那边走
It's that way.

236
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:22,461
回去
Back

237
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,892
那把枪正顶在伊斯兰佬的脑门上

238
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:43,690
计程车开了
Taxi's moving.

239
00:21:45,532 --> 00:21:46,305
从车上面下来！
Get out of the car!

240
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:49,100
停车！把车停下！
Stop! Stop the car!

241
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,842
- 下来，从上面下来！   - 趴在地下！
- Get out, get out of the fucking car!    - Get out the ground!

242
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,394
- 趴下!    - 不许动！
- Underground!    - Stay down!

243
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,974
如果他以前不是叛乱分子 那现在总该算了吧
Well, if he wasn't an insurgent, he sure the hell is now.

244
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,877
收到，你的话真有趣…
Roger that! That's real funny.

245
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,975
我发现了些东西
Got something

246
00:23:11,578 --> 00:23:12,905
嘿，小亲亲
Oh, baby!

Gotcha

248
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:01,662
好了
All right

249
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,502
完事了
We're done

250
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:13,302
可以引爆了，可以引爆了
Good to go

251
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:14,967
下来，技术兵

Where are you going?

256
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:59,344
还有其他的
Secondary

00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:00,224
妈的
Shit

258
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:02,097
找掩护，躲到墙后面去！
Take cover! Get in the wall! Get in the wall!

259
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:49,913
初次合作还不错，你觉得呢？
That wasn't so bad. First time working together. What do you think?

260
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:57,746
我有情况告诉你，你有情况告诉我 这才叫合作
I think us working together means I talk to you and you talk to me

261
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,774
- 我们是在约会吗，桑伯恩？    - 不
- We going on a date, Sanborn?    - No

262
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:02,426

我负责保护你的安全 这样我们才好继续执行其他任务
and my job is to keep you safe so we can keep going on missions.

264
00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:07,306
这是战斗，伙计
It's combat, buddy.

265

267
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:19,584
如果今天不死的话，还剩38天
Thirty-eight if we survive today.

268
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,688
是你啊，“尽我所能”先生
Hey, it's ''Mr., Be All You Can Be''!

269
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:41,590
有甚么新闻吗，医生？
What's up, doc?

270
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:43,175
没什么，你怎么样？
Not much, How are you?

271
00:27:44,018 --> 00:27:44,898
我很好
I'm good.

272
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:50,532
有个问题,关于那首歌“尽我所能”
Got a question about that song, ''Be All You Can Be''.

273
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:54,453
如果尽我所能的结果是横尸伊拉克街头 那我怎么办？
What if all I can be is dead on the side of an Iraqi road?

274
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:55,941
这事不是没有可能
I mean, I think it's logical.

275
00:27:55,946 --> 00:28:01,560
这是战争，每天都有人死 当然可能也会落到我头上
This is war, people die all the time. Why not me?

276
00:28:02,536 --> 00:28:03,705
你必须换一种想法
You got to change the record in our head.

277
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:05,584
你得去想些其他的东西
You gotta start thinking about other things.

278
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:07,366
别老想这个了
Okay, Stop obsessing... Right now.

279
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,683
现在你在想什么？
What are you thinking about?

280
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:11,870
- 我在想什么，你想知道嘛？    - 是的
You want to know what I'm thinking about, doc?     - Yeah

281
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:14,122
我在想的就是这个
This is what I'm thinking about, doc.

282
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:20,354
地下躺着汤姆森… 他死了，他没死
Here's Thompson, okay. He's dead, he's alive.

283
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:24,091
地下躺着汤姆森… 他死了，他没死
Here's Thompson. He's dead, he's alive.

284
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:26,969
他死了，他没死
He's dead. He's alive.

285
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,397
嘿，最近如何，你好吗？
Yo, what's up, my nigger? What's up, man? You cool?

286
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:38,442
想要好货么？看看嘛，这货很正的
Come on, You want the cool shit? Come on, come on, It's the tight shit, man,

287
00:28:38,447 --> 00:28:40,944
要买DVD吗？要买DVD吗？
Wanna buy DVD? Wanna buy DVD?

288
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:43,110
去你的…别这样，拜托！
Fuck you, Come, come, please, please1

289
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:44,782
是新片！
New releases, look.

290
00:28:44,787 --> 00:28:47,447
你好你好，要DVD吗？绝赞绝赞的！
Hello, Hello! Want to buy DVDs? Very good, Very good,

291
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:48,410
多少钱？
How much?

292
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:49,912
5元一张，9元两张
One for five and two for nine,

293
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,151
三张12元怎么样？
Three for twelve.

294
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:54,041
三张13元，还不加税 东西非常好，你看看
Three for thirteen and I don't give you tax. Very good, man. Look.

295
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:55,959
- 看这儿…    - 不加税？
- Look...    - No tax?

296
00:28:55,964 --> 00:28:57,920
好吧，你有些什么片子？
All right, What do you got? What do you got,

297
00:28:57,925 --> 00:29:01,423
算你丫聪明，不像那些蠢大粪
You know, you smart shit, You not like those stupid fuck face.

298
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:03,213
是啊，我是聪明人
Yeah, I'm the smart guy.

299
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:06,762
你是个聪明的孩子 把你的顶级货给我吧
You're a smart kid, Give me your best one, okay?

300
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,348
- 给你，这是顶级的    - 这个就是顶级的？
- Here, this the best one.    - This is a good one?

301
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:11,638
- 绝对顶级，老兄    - 好吧
- Yeah, The best shit, man.    - Okay

302
00:29:11,855 --> 00:29:13,227
钱给你，我买一张
Here you go, I'll take one.

303
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:15,105
- 不用找了    - 谢谢
- Keep the change    - Thank you

304
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,268
要香烟吗？
Want a cigarette?

305
00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:18,745
才不给呢，你不该抽烟
Get out of here, You shouldn't smoke.

306
00:29:20,531 --> 00:29:22,149
谢谢，跟你开个玩笑
Thank you. Take it easy.

307
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:31,383
在下次任务之前，我得和你谈谈
I need to talk to you about something before we go out again.

308
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:33,285
要说什么？
What's that?

309
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:37,164
- 昨天的事    - 恩
- Yesterday    - Mm-hmm

310
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:39,541
可不好玩
Wasn't cool

311
00:29:40,884 --> 00:29:44,396
我知道，但你会习惯的，会习惯的
Yeah, I know. You'll get it, though.

312
00:29:47,016 --> 00:29:49,860
- 这么说你是个独行侠？    - 对喽
- So, you're a ranger, huh?    - Yeah.

313
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:53,739
来拆弹组之前，我在情报部门干了7年
I was in intelligence seven years before I joined EOD,

314
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:58,952
我们在各种恶劣情况下执行任务 对此你肯定有概念
We ran missions in every shithole that you could possibly imagine.

315
00:30:01,405 --> 00:30:05,375
像你这样居无定所的乡巴佬 我想我是看得蛮透的
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a redneck piece of trailer trash like you.

316
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:09,212
看来你已经开始习惯了
Looks like you're on the right track.

317
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:12,466
我们在外面等你
We'll see you out there.

318
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:24,962
快走
Let's go, move!

319
00:30:25,167 --> 00:30:28,525
[ 距B连轮值结束日还有37天 ]

320
00:30:31,352 --> 00:30:34,346
该死，快让开
Shit, Get out of the way. Move!

321
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,685
你好
Hello

322
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:43,108
- 东西呢？    - 在墙后面
- Where is it?    - It's behind the wall

323
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:45,569
有没有看到电线或者烟雾什么的？
- All right! See any wires? Any smoke?

324
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:46,737
不，我没有细看
No, I didn't look

325
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:47,863
那你怎么知道是炸弹？
So, how do you know it's a bomb?

326
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:50,240
那辆车违法停靠在那里
The car has been parked illegally

327
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:53,410
而且悬挂特别低，后备箱里一定有重物
The suspension is sagging. There's definitely something heavy in the trunk,

328
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:56,992
好，不如你现在过去看看 然后告诉我那里面有什么
Right. So, why don't you walk over there and peak inside and tell me what you see.

329
00:30:58,045 --> 00:30:59,998
你要我走过去看？
You want me to go close to it?

330
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:03,333
没错…不不，我没那个意思，开玩笑
Yeah! No-no, I don't. I'm kidding.

331
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:56,889
妈的！
Shit

332
00:31:57,021 --> 00:31:58,680
枪声从那儿来！
It's coming from over here!

333
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:06,538
拆弹1号，你在吗？
Blaster One. You there?

334
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:13,946
拆弹1号，听到了吗？
Blaster One, you hear me?

335
00:32:15,372 --> 00:32:16,865
拿着
Here

336
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:24,998
见鬼
Shit

337
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:29,211
来啊，伙计们
Let's go, guys.

338
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:32,422
放手
Let it go.

339
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:34,480
我去屋顶掩护！
I got top cover.

340
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:35,596
不行，技术兵
That's a negative, specialist.

341
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:36,972
艾缀奇，你得跟着我
Eldridge, you stay with me.

342
00:32:36,977 --> 00:32:38,557
桑伯恩，你去屋顶掩护
Sanborn, you take top covers.

343
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:39,596
该死
Shit

344
00:33:19,603 --> 00:33:21,096
拆弹迈克，到达指定地点
Blaster Mike in position

345
00:33:46,463 --> 00:33:47,639
情况如何？
What do you got?

346
00:33:47,673 --> 00:33:50,875
子弹贯穿了他的胸膛，但不致命
I got a through and through to the chest, but I got him stable.

347
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:52,687
看来他没希望了
He's not going to make it.

348
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,883
如果15分钟内带他离开 那他的伤还有救，长官
We're leaving in 15 minutes. Got a survival wound, sir.

349
00:33:57,516 --> 00:33:59,526
他没希望了
He's not going to make it.

350
00:34:27,463 --> 00:34:28,780
哦，上帝啊
Oh, God.

351
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:42,277
- 他在干嘛？    - 我不知道
- What's he doing?    - I don't know,

352
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:47,144
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

353
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:49,584
那里面的炸药足够大家一起见上帝了
There's enough bang in there to send us all to Jesus.

354
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:53,483
如果要死，我也要死的舒服一些
If I'm going to die, I'm going to die comfortable.

355
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,499
把我的家什都拿来
I need my kit and my cans.

356
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:57,276
怎么了，艾缀奇？
What's going on down there, Eldridge?

357
00:34:57,534 --> 00:35:00,882
我去帮他拿家什，请给我掩护
I'm getting his kit and his cans. Cover me, please.

358
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:12,816
给你
Kit and cans

359
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:32,998
好多导爆线…是电子起爆
Got a Lot of deck cord, electrical

360
00:35:51,922 --> 00:35:54,132
我在找起爆装置
I'm looking for this initiating system

361
00:36:21,535 --> 00:36:23,620
似乎不在后座里
Well, it's not in the back seat.

362
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:27,541
我不这么想
I don't think.

363
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:43,181
好了，它不在后座里
All right, It's not in the back seat.

364
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:55,147
有个年轻人在屋顶，9点钟方向，盯住了
Got a young man on the roof, your 9:00, keep an eye on him.

365
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:56,681
收到
Roger that

366
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:06,054
也不在前座
It's not in the front seat.

367
00:37:11,877 --> 00:37:13,853
不在门里
It's not in the door.

368
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,486
不在地板上
Not on the floors.

369
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:27,084
不在手套箱里
Not in the glove box.

370
00:37:27,184 --> 00:37:29,515
如果还没找到，有可能在车下面
If you haven't found it yet, it's probably under the car.

371
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,955
车下面没线，肯定藏在车里
Yeah, no wire leads under... the car. It's all in here somewhere.

372
00:37:40,364 --> 00:37:42,277
- 嘿，桑伯恩    - 怎么？
- Hey, Sanborn    - Yeah

373
00:37:42,282 --> 00:37:45,322
你刚才是不是看到一个人 手里拿了摄像机？
You got eyes on some guy, with a video camera?

374
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:46,699
没有啊，在哪儿？
No, Where?

375
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:50,890
在我12点钟方向，看到了吗？ 他举着那个鸟东西对着我
He's right at my 12:00, you see him? He's pointing the fucking thing at me

376
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:03,757
- 该死    - 没有，我没看到他
- Shit    - Negative, I don't see him.

377
00:38:03,762 --> 00:38:07,899
桑伯恩，他就在我12点方向
Hey, Sanborn. He's right at my 12:00, look! 12:00!

378
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,118
收到，我看到他了
Roger that, I got him.

379
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:16,725
他想拍下我，然后传到YOUTUBE上
Getting ready to put me on YouTube.

380
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:20,149
- 有点可疑啊    - 我也这样觉得，盯着他。
- Little shady.   - Yeah, he Looks shady. Keep an eye on him,

381
00:38:20,154 --> 00:38:22,189
好，我该怎么做？
Okay, So, what's the play?

382
00:38:23,365 --> 00:38:25,974
放聪明点，别胡来，完毕
Be smart. Make a good decision, over

383
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,601
这里线更多
Got more wire

384
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:41,958
通向什么鬼地方
Leads fucking nowhere

385
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:44,736
妈的！
Fuck!

386
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,238
嘿，詹姆斯，你那边怎么样了？
Hey, James, how you doing?

387
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,220
好极了，你怎么样？
I'm wonderful, How are you?

388
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:52,287
在这儿呆的时间已经够长的了
You know, we've been here a while

389
00:38:53,604 --> 00:38:55,100
必须尽快离开这里
We need to get out of here soon.

390
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:56,423
哦
Uh-huh,

391
00:39:00,986 --> 00:39:04,522
很多人在看着我们，必须快点离开
We got a lot of eyes on us, James. We need to get out of here.

392
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:09,094
收到，我想我能解决
Roger that, I might figure this out.

393
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:12,238
詹姆斯，我们必须快点离开
James, we need to get out of here,

394
00:39:13,123 --> 00:39:15,308
詹姆斯，你听到了吗？
James, do you copy?

395
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:17,686
妈的，我知道了
Fuck it, I get it.

396
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:21,995
我靠
Fuck me

397
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:32,450
- 嘿，下面情况怎么样？    - 疏散完毕
- Hey, how's it looking in there, soldier?    - All clear

398
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:34,932
詹姆斯，人员已疏散完毕，可以撤了
James, the evac is complete. We can leave.

399
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:36,433
让工兵来料理后事吧
Let the engineers handle this mess,

400
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:39,124
- 我们撤么？    - 是的
- We moving?    - That's affirmative

401
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:54,118
有意思
Interesting

402
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:56,741
詹姆斯怎么回事？他没回话
What's up with James? He's not answering

403
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:59,994
呃，他好像摘掉了耳机
Yeah, I think he removed his headset,

404
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:03,836
能不能跟他说，让他戴上耳机？
Well, will you tell him to put his radio back on, please?

405
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:05,129
嘿，詹姆斯
Hey, James!

406
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:09,993
桑伯恩中士问你，能不能戴上耳机
Sergeant Sanborn is asking if you'll please put your headset back on.

407
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:18,291
呃…他不同意
Uh... that's a negative.

408
00:40:18,313 --> 00:40:20,990
- 他不肯戴上耳机    - 该死的
- That, yeah, that's not gonna happen.    - Shit!

409
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,926
清真寺尖塔顶上有3个人，6点钟方向
I got eyes on three guys at the Minaret at 6:00.

410
00:40:57,895 --> 00:41:01,226
- 他到底在干嘛？    - 我怎么知道…
- What the hell is he doing?    - I don't know what the fuck he's doing!

411
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:03,541
像是在检查油箱
Looks like, he's checking the oil.

412
00:41:40,854 --> 00:41:43,190
他们在和摄像的男人联络
They're communicating with your cameraman.

413
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:44,520
不妙啊，老兄
This is real bad, man.

414
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:46,543
蹲到护栏后面去
Get behind the Jersey barrier.

415
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,112
在这里我看不到詹姆斯
I can't see James from here.

416
00:41:53,117 --> 00:41:54,843
马上给我蹲下！
Get down now!

417
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:01,441
可以走了！
We can go!

418
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:09,441
王八蛋
Bastard

419
00:42:32,948 --> 00:42:34,758
活干完了
We're done.

420
00:42:36,285 --> 00:42:40,013
桑伯恩，我们走！
Sanborn, let's get out of here.

421
00:42:54,386 --> 00:42:55,791
喔
Woo

422
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:09,693
真爽
That was good.

423
00:43:19,912 --> 00:43:21,995
- 嘿，詹姆斯    - 嗯？
- Hey, James!    - What?

424
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:26,518
再也不许摘掉耳机
Never turn your headset off again.

425
00:43:51,944 --> 00:43:53,850
你就是那个拆弹员？
You the guy in the bomb suit?

426
00:43:53,946 --> 00:43:57,055
不，长官，是詹姆斯上士，他在那里
No, sir, Sir, that's Sergeant James. He's right here.

427
00:43:57,116 --> 00:43:59,057
- 嘿，詹姆斯    - 嗯？
- Hey, James.    - Yeah?

428
00:43:59,118 --> 00:44:00,725
有人找你
Someone's here to see you.

429
00:44:02,037 --> 00:44:04,451
搞定起火轿车的那个就是你？
You the guy in the flaming car. Sergeant James?

430
00:44:04,456 --> 00:44:06,766
下午好，是我干的，长官
Afternoon, sir Uh, yes, sir

431
00:44:07,084 --> 00:44:10,332
好，简直太棒了
Well, that's just hot shit.

432
00:44:10,337 --> 00:44:12,814
你是个强人，知道吗？
You're a wild man, you know that?

433
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:14,920
- 是的，长官    - 他是个强人
- Uh, yes, sir    - He's a wild man

434
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:16,426
你们知道吗？
You know that?

435
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:18,653
我想和你握手
I want to shake your hand.

436
00:44:18,846 --> 00:44:20,175
- 谢谢长官    - 好
- Thank you, sir.    - Yeah

437
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,093
你拆过多少炸弹？
How many bombs have you disarmed?

438
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,805
啊，我不是很确定…
Uh, I'm not quite sure.

439
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,098
- 上士！    - 是，长官
- Sergeant?    - Yes, sir.

440
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:27,871
我在问你问题
I asked you a question.

441
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:30,561
873个，长官
Eight hundred seventy-three, sir.

442
00:44:30,566 --> 00:44:34,986
八百！七十三！
Eight hundred! And seventy-three.

443
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:37,359
简直棒到没话说
That's just hot shit.

444
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:39,533
八百！七十三！
Eight-hundred and seventy-three.

445
00:44:39,783 --> 00:44:42,485
- 今天的也算在里面了，是吗？    - 这一定是最高记录
- Counting today, sir, yes.    - That's gotta be a record.

446
00:44:44,204 --> 00:44:49,267
拆这些鬼东西…最好的方法是什么？
What's the best way to... go about disarming one of these things?

447
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:52,287
是活着拆了它，长官
The way you don't die, sir.

448
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:54,710
呵呵，是个好方法
That's a good one.

449
00:44:54,715 --> 00:44:58,209
强人就该这么说话，真不错
That's spoken like a wild man. That's good.

450
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:16,900
- 你好啊    - 嘿嘿，等一下
- Hey, what's up, man?    - Oh, hey, wait a minute,

451
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:18,538
看看这是谁啊？
Look who it is.

452
00:45:19,782 --> 00:45:21,311
把5元钱还给我，老弟
I want my five bucks back, buddy.

453
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:23,607
什么5元钱？你发痴啊？
Five dollars for what, man? You crazy now?

454
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:25,599
你卖给我的DVD是什么狗屁东西！
Yeah, The DVD you sold me was crap.

455
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:28,785
你胡说，不可能，那是好莱坞特技
You crazy, man. That's impossible. It's Hollywood special effects.

456
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,396
画面不仅晃，还一片模糊
No, It was shaky. It was out of focus, buddy.

457
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:31,873
- 那你要看什么，兽交？    - 那片子是垃圾
- What, you want donkey porn?    - It's crap.

458
00:45:31,878 --> 00:45:34,118
女人和狗做？还是男同志片？
Girls on dog? Gay sex, man?

459
00:45:34,129 --> 00:45:35,616
你要什么，就给你什么
Anything you want, you get.

460
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:37,900
我跟你，那是啥关系
I hook you up, man.

461
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:39,748
哈哈哈哈，好吧，你叫什么名字？
All right, What... what's your name?

462
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,875
-贝克汉姆    -贝克汉姆？那个足球运动员？
- Beckham.    - Beckham like the soccer player?

463
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:43,968
就是那个足球明星，把球还给我
Yeah, man. It's like soccer player. Now give me my ball.

464
00:45:43,973 --> 00:45:45,212
你是足球运动员？
Are you a soccer player?

465
00:45:45,224 --> 00:45:48,255
是的，我是王中王，比贝克汉姆还强
Yeah, man, Best of the best. I'm better than Beckham.

466
00:45:48,268 --> 00:45:50,821
- 你会守门么？    - 是的，我会    - 好
- You play goalie?    - Yes, I play goalie    - Good

467
00:45:50,938 --> 00:45:55,492
那我们来赌一场，如果你能守住我的球 我就再给你5块钱
I'll make you a deal. If you can stop the ball, I'm going to give you five bucks,

468
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:57,850
- 但如果你没守住…    - 没守住怎么样？
- but if you can't...    - And what if... what if I can't?

469
00:45:57,861 --> 00:46:01,210
如果我射进你的门，这球就归我
Listen to me. If I score, I'm going to keep your ball,

470
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,766
- 成不成？    - 成
- Deal?    - Deal

471
00:46:04,368 --> 00:46:05,441
过去吧
Get up there

472
00:46:05,452 --> 00:46:08,397
走啊
Go on

473
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:14,594
- 看看你有什么能耐    - 准备好了吗？
- Let's see what you got hot stuff    - Are you ready?

474
00:46:14,795 --> 00:46:16,288
我数到3，你准备好了吗？
On three, Ready?

475
00:46:16,422 --> 00:46:19,850
1…2…3！啊…
One, two, three... Aahh!

476
00:46:23,137 --> 00:46:24,114
该死
Shit

477
00:46:24,138 --> 00:46:25,885
快点，我的5块钱呢？
Come on Where's the five dollars? Man, come on.

478
00:46:25,888 --> 00:46:28,622
好吧，我给你，不错嘛，年轻人
All right, I got ya. Good job, dude.

479
00:46:29,560 --> 00:46:30,888
五块钱给你
Here's five.

480
00:46:30,978 --> 00:46:33,226
你是拆弹组的？
You're an EOD, boomala, boomala.

481
00:46:33,231 --> 00:46:34,345
没错
That's right.

482
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:35,431
那很有趣吧？
It's fun, no?

483
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:37,226
好像黑帮一样，对不对？
It's cool? It's gangster.

484
00:46:37,484 --> 00:46:40,771
- 是吧    - 差不多吧
- Yeah?    - Yeah, I think so.

485
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,982
那什么，我要买…
Tell you what, I'm going to buy...

486
00:46:44,158 --> 00:46:47,628
让我看看钱够不够…好，够五块钱
Let me see if I have enough money, yeah. Five.

487
00:46:48,078 --> 00:46:50,464
我要再买张DVD
I'm going to buy another DVD, okay?

488
00:46:50,914 --> 00:46:55,302
但如果还是晃，或者画面模糊
But if it's shaky... Look at me... or out of focus...

489
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:57,929
或者不是百分百的好片
or any way not 100%,

490
00:46:58,213 --> 00:47:01,201
我就拿把钝刀，把你的小脑瓜子锯下来
I'm going to chop off your god dammed head with a dull knife.

491
00:47:01,216 --> 00:47:03,685
怕了吧？我只是开玩笑，开玩笑
How do you feel about that? I'm just kidding.

492
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:08,231
你是个好娃娃，真是个好娃娃
Here, you're a good kid, man. You're a good kid, aren't ya?

493
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:10,734
欧文！
Owen

494
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:12,758
嗨！
Hi

495
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,279
- 你好，长官！    - 怎么样？
- Hi, sir,    - How are you?

496
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:16,390
- 不错    - 很好
- I'm good    - Good

497
00:47:16,482 --> 00:47:19,242
- 哪里坏了？    - 刹车的声音不对
- What's wrong?    - Brakes are squeaking

498
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,937
这里的机修工不太靠得住
Don't trust the mechanics around here. You know.

499
00:47:22,863 --> 00:47:25,374
- 最近怎么样？    - 我很好
- So, how you doing?    - Good

500
00:47:25,616 --> 00:47:27,209
我去检查下油箱
I just want to check the oil.

501
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,629
吃得也好，睡得也香
Yeah, it's good to sleep, eating well...

502
00:47:31,163 --> 00:47:33,490
感觉整个人神清气爽，真的
I'm feeling pretty squared away, actually, doc.

503
00:47:33,499 --> 00:47:34,950
听你这么说，我很高兴
Good to hear it.

504
00:47:35,376 --> 00:47:38,303
和同部队的战友相处得还好么？
So, you getting along with the other soldiers in your unit?

505
00:47:39,505 --> 00:47:45,185
嗯，我们队很棒，队长很会鼓舞人
Yeah, My team's great. My team Leader is inspiring.

506
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:48,785
- 你是在说反话么？    - 没有
- Are you being sarcastic, soldier?    - No

507
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:50,607
他正打算送我归西呢
He's going to get me killed.

508
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:52,693
昨天差点就成功了
almost died yesterday.

509
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:57,614
至少是因公殉职，我感到很自豪很光荣
At least I'll die in the line of duty, proud and strong.

510
00:47:57,773 --> 00:48:00,200
这不是你人生的低谷
You know, this doesn't have to be a bad time in your life.

511
00:48:00,484 --> 00:48:03,870
参战是你一生中难得的经历
Going to war is a - is a once in a lifetime experience.

512
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:05,314
也许可以很有趣
It could be fun.

513
00:48:05,364 --> 00:48:08,230
是丰富的实战经验让你得出这些结论的么？
And you know this from your extensive work in the field, right?

514
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:09,960
我已履行了我的兵役
I've done my field duty.

515
00:48:10,244 --> 00:48:12,129
在哪儿服的役？耶鲁大学？
Where's that? Yale?

516
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:16,739
如果你不想和我谈，我可以不来找你
Look, you don't want me to come around, I won't come around.

517
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,343
我是出于志愿才来帮你
These talks are voluntary.

518
00:48:18,669 --> 00:48:20,137
我很抱歉
Look, I'm sorry.

519
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:23,198
你能跟我说这些，我很感激，真的
I appreciate what you're saying, I do.

520
00:48:23,215 --> 00:48:25,225
我也很感谢你给我的心理治疗
I appreciate our sessions together,

521
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:29,963
但你也需要走到前方去看看 看看我们在做的事情
but you need to come out from behind the wire, see what we do.

522
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:31,506
好吧
Well,

523
00:48:32,016 --> 00:48:34,128
如果情况需要，我会去的
if this circumstance calls for it, I will.

524
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:35,986
就像别的士兵一样
Just like every other soldier.

525
00:48:40,597 --> 00:48:42,218
[ 距B连轮值结束日还有23天 ]

526
00:48:42,234 --> 00:48:43,610
目标起爆！
Fire in the hole!

527
00:48:43,652 --> 00:48:44,987
起爆！
Firing now!

528
00:48:51,952 --> 00:48:53,987
- 准备好第二次爆炸了没？    - 准备好了
- Ready for second det?    - Ready

529
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:57,895
目标起爆！目标起爆！目标起爆！
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole, Fire in the hole!

530
00:48:57,916 --> 00:48:59,718
喂喂喂，等一下
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hold on a second!

531
00:49:00,336 --> 00:49:03,612
天杀的，我好像把手套忘在那里了
God damn it, I think it forgot my gloves down there.

532
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,724
- 什么？    - 我忘拿手套了
- What?    - I forgot my gloves.

533
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:06,989
等一下
Hang on

534
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:43,952
这些引爆器很容易误爆啊
You know, these detonators misfire all the time.

535
00:49:45,297 --> 00:49:46,640
你是甚么意思？
What are you doing?

536
00:49:47,424 --> 00:49:49,968
我只是说，总免不了有倒霉事 比如可能发生误爆
I'm just saying shit happens, they misfire.

537
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,048
他会被炸成粉粉面面的
He'd be obliterated to nothing,

538
00:49:56,684 --> 00:49:58,860
也许能剩个头盔，那就归你好了
His helmet would be left, You could have that.

539
00:49:59,103 --> 00:50:01,947
还有几缕头发，内层或许会有些焦
Little specs of hair, charred on the inside.

540
00:50:02,982 --> 00:50:05,158
是啊，也许能找到半个头盔
Yeah, there'd be half a helmet somewhere,

541
00:50:05,901 --> 00:50:07,286
还有一点点头发
bits of hair.

542
00:50:08,988 --> 00:50:11,687
然后我们要求改进技术流程
Ask for a change in technique and protocol,

543
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:14,501
以确保此类事故不再发生
make sure this type of accident never happen again, you know?

544
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:19,339
这样的话，你得写一份报告
You'd have to write the report.

545
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:24,386
- 你是认真的吗？    - 我写不来的
- Are you serious?    - I can't write it.

546
00:50:25,629 --> 00:50:28,265
不，我是问你，真想杀了他？
No, I mean, are you serious about killing him?

547
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:11,433
- 12点钟方向有一辆SUV越野车    - 收到
- Twelve o'clock I see an SUV    - Roger that

548
00:51:11,508 --> 00:51:13,435
我看到4个全副武装的家伙
I got four armed men.

549
00:51:13,552 --> 00:51:15,437
伊斯兰的装扮
They're in Haji gear.

550
00:51:16,847 --> 00:51:18,774
好，慢慢靠过去
All right, go slow and easy.

551
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:28,617
停车
Careful now.

552
00:51:31,403 --> 00:51:33,664
好，各位小心点
All right, Careful now, guys.

553
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:36,295
- 艾缀奇，你守好机枪    - 我把着呢
- Eldridge, you stay on that 50.    - I got 'em.

554
00:51:36,325 --> 00:51:39,740
放下枪，放下你们的枪
''Obre... obre...'' put your gun down!

555
00:51:39,745 --> 00:51:43,575
跪在地上，放下枪！
On your knees! Put your gun down!

556
00:51:43,582 --> 00:51:46,789
- 混蛋    - 把手举高
- Obre, motherfucker!    - Hold up your hands!

557
00:51:46,794 --> 00:51:49,179
跪下！ 混蛋
Get down, motherfucker, Obre!

558
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:51,890
快把枪放到地上！
Put your gun down now!

559
00:51:57,346 --> 00:51:59,398
把枪放下！
Put your gun down!

560
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:05,153
前进，前进
Advance, advance...

561
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:26,717
手举高！
Hands high!

562
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:29,678
- 艾缀奇，掩护！    - 明白
- Eldridge, cover!    - I got you

563
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:32,973
把背后的手枪扔掉，快点！
Pistol, off your hip, now!

564
00:52:33,298 --> 00:52:34,128
到底要我干嘛？
What you want me to do?

565
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:36,184
把手举高还是扔掉手枪？
Keep my hands up or take off the pistol?

566
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:40,397
- 举着你的手    - 好
- Keep your hands up    - Okay

567
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:47,304
慢点，慢点
Easy, easy.

568
00:52:47,688 --> 00:52:48,889
拿到
Got it!

569
00:52:50,983 --> 00:52:52,868
我可以碰自己的脑袋吗？
Can I touch my fucking head now?

570
00:52:54,403 --> 00:52:55,537
慢一点
Slowly

571
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:05,505
伙计们，我们是一条战线的
We're on the same fucking side, guys.

572
00:53:06,582 --> 00:53:07,741
哦，上帝
Jesus

573
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:10,414
你们实在有点草木皆兵了
You guys are wired fucking tight, you know that?

574
00:53:10,419 --> 00:53:13,542
这里可不是野餐的地方，你们在这里干嘛？
Well, this is no place for a picnic, right. What are you guys doing here?

575
00:53:13,547 --> 00:53:15,377
我们的车胎爆了，能帮我们吗？
We have a flat tire, can you help us?

576
00:53:15,382 --> 00:53:17,046
没问题，你们有备胎吗？
Sure, yeah. You got any spares?

577
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:19,214
备胎是有，可我们的扳手用光了
We have spares, but we've used up our wrench.

578
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:20,612
扳手怎么会用光的？
How do you use up a wrench?

579
00:53:20,637 --> 00:53:23,303
呃…那个包着红头巾的男人
Well, the uh, the guy over there with the red thing on his head,

580
00:53:23,308 --> 00:53:24,591
他拿扳手当飞镖使了
he threw it at someone.

581
00:53:25,726 --> 00:53:27,319
- 呵，好吧    - 谢谢
- All right    - Thank you

582
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:34,326
这是克里斯，这是扳手男
That's Chris, this is the wrench man.

583
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,565
- 你好，扳手男    - 那个是杰米
- Hello, wrench man.    - That's Jimmy.

584
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,026
在这里你可以用枪打，不用扔扳手
You know, you can shoot people here, you don't have to throw a wrench at 'em,

585
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,088
去你的
Fuck off

586
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,243
看看这个
Take a look at this,

587
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:53,929
这些人是在纳杰夫(伊拉克圣城)抓的
I picked these guys up in Najaf.

588
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,599
这个是红心9号通缉犯
Nine of hearts, that's one,

589
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:01,311
另外一个，就是梅花J
And the other... jack of clubs,

590
00:54:06,016 --> 00:54:08,151
- 就是他们？    - 没错，就是他们
- These the same guys?    - Yep, That's them.

591
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:12,890
他需要帮忙吗？
Does he need a little help there?

592
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:15,409
轮胎到底什么问题？快点！
What's the problem with the tire? Come on.

593
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:20,187
这个不行，老大，这个太小了
No good, boss. This wrench is too small.

594
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,735
谁有解决办法吗？
All right, solutions? Anyone?

595
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,321
在悍马车后好像还有把扳手
I think there's another wrench in the back of the Humvee if you want to check,

596
00:54:24,326 --> 00:54:25,984
- 那我试试看吧    - 好，快点干
- I'll give it a try.    - All right. Let's do it.

597
00:54:27,413 --> 00:54:28,894
你们来这里多久了？
How long you guys out here?

598
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:31,675
我不知道，技术兵，我们来多久了？
Well, I don't know. Specialist, what do we got?

599
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:38,181
还有23天吧…不对，还剩22天就…
- We have... 23 more days or 22... - Oh yeah

600
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:41,990
没人仔细算过
No one's counting.

601
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:47,190
左边接敌！
Contact left!

602
00:54:57,318 --> 00:54:58,957
找掩护！
Take cover!

603
00:54:58,986 --> 00:55:01,984
克里斯，上机枪 吉米，拿悍马车里的家伙
Chris, take the 50. Jimmy, take that in the Humvee.

604
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:03,649
- 明白    - 快点！
- Got it.    - Come on!

605
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:18,977
查理，走！
Charlie, go!

606
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,730
走！走！
Go, go, go!

607
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:30,033
混账东西
Fucking morons!

608
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:33,992
查理，保护侧翼 杰米，把狙击枪和冲锋包拿来
Get on the side, Charlie Get the Barret and the go-bag, Jimmy.

609
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:38,954
- 我们在打谁？    - 我怎么知道
- What are we shooting at?    - I don't know.

610
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:40,795
妈的，通缉犯跑啦！
Fuck, the packages are gone!

611
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,087
他们跑不远的
They won't get far on foot.

612
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:45,392
把那俩给我逮回来 不能让50万元就这么飞了
Bring 'em back those fuckers now. I'm out 500,000 fucking pounds.

613
00:55:58,484 --> 00:55:59,585
哈哈，我忘了
I forgot,

614
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,104
无论生死，都值50万
it's 500,000 dead or alive.

615
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:08,543
- 杰米，把巴雷特狙击枪给我    - 好
- Okay Jimmy, give me the Barret.    - Yeah

616
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:11,780
我什么也看不见
I can't see a thing.

617
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:14,825
来吧！
Come on!

618
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:22,878
克里斯在乱射…得节约子弹啊
Chris is shooting wild. Gotta conserve the ammo.

619
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:24,476
克里斯，听到我说话吗？
Hey, Chris can you hear me?

620
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:29,093
克里斯！听见没？别一个劲开枪！
Hey, Chris! Chris! Can you hear me? Chill out on the 50!

621
00:56:29,098 --> 00:56:30,357
收到！

622
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:34,986
- 机枪哑火了！    - 克里斯被击中了
- Fifty's down    - They shot Chris.

623
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:47,694
子弹一定是从那房子里出来的
It must be coming from that building.

624
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,109
我什么也看不见
I can't see anything.

625
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:55,424
有人在房顶移动
Movement on the roof.

626
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:10,355
怎么样？
Yeah?

627
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:11,882
再抬高3米
Three meters higher.

628
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:16,194
我调整一下
I'm going to adjust.

629
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:45,707
妈的
Fuck

630
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:48,543
妈的，他死了
Fuck, he's dead.

631
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:50,287
我们必须马上离开这里
We've got to get out of here now!

632
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:50,911
妈的！
Damm it.

633
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:52,635
这里是阿尔法9，情况危急
This is Alpha Nine. We're in deep shit.

634
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,927
我去狙击
I'll get on the Barret.

635
00:57:53,932 --> 00:57:54,803
走，走！
Go, go, go!

636
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:56,513
是，我们受到攻击
Yeah, we're taking incoming fire.

637
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:57,514
走，走！
Go, go, go!

638
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:59,641
- 桑伯恩，别上去    - 收到
- No, Sanborn, don't come up here    - Got it!

639
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:01,435
过去，伙计，压低身体！
Go, buddy, Stay low! Stay Low!

640
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,683
我方伤亡2人
I have two KIA,

641
00:58:03,192 --> 00:58:07,120
更正，伤亡3人…现处方位是…

642
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:08,225
身体压低！
Stay low!

643
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:09,577
能帮我一下么？
Can you get me some help?

644
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:11,700
收到，阿尔法9，请稍候，完毕
Copy, Alpha Nine. Hold on, over.

645
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:13,493
- 我来了    - 好
- Behind you    - Yeah

646
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:31,587
放松
Breathe easy

647
00:58:33,639 --> 00:58:35,574
- 发现人影    - 嗯
- I got movement    - Yeah

648
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:37,509
在房顶上
On the ridge of that house

649
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,490
距离850米
Eight hundred and fifty meters

650
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:45,976
- 看见了    - 在窗边…
- See it    - By the window

651
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:50,664
- 有个目标    - 看见了
- You got target    - Got it

652
00:58:57,162 --> 00:58:59,214
有点偏左
All right, here little left.

653
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:01,480
放松
Just breathe easy

654
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,761
没子弹了
- I'm out of ammo - Hmm?

655
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:14,717
我没子弹了
I'm out of ammo.

656
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:17,299
艾缀奇，我们需要子弹！
Eldridge, we need ammo.

657
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:22,854
子弹在哪里？
Where is it?

658
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:25,432
在那死人身上翻翻看
Check on the dead guy, man.

659
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:26,850
在死人身上
It's on the dead man.

660
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:34,399
艾缀奇！
Eldridge!

661
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:35,796
我在找！
I'm looking.

662
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,580
我们要子弹！
We need that ammo, man.

663
00:59:40,622 --> 00:59:41,823
知道了
All right, man.

664
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:44,926
好，找到了
Oh, here.

665
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:48,956
谢谢
Thanks

666
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:03,432
好了
All right. Got it.

667
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:05,238
目标不变
Same target.

668
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,870
妈的，卡壳了
It's fucking jammed.

669
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:11,525
让我看看
Let me see it.

670
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:14,590
妈的
Fuck!

671
01:00:14,782 --> 01:00:19,628
该死，血把子弹卡住了…艾缀奇！
Aw, shit. The blood's making it jam, Eldridge.

672
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:20,971
该死
Shit!

673
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,203
血把子弹卡住了，把血弄干净
You gotta clean the blood off, man. It's making 'em jam.

674
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:24,825
技术兵！
Specialist!

675
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,296
- 把血擦干净    - 好
- Clean the blood off.    - Okay

676
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:36,995
快点，快点
Clean it. Clean it.

677
01:00:37,805 --> 01:00:39,009
得把它弄干净！
You gotta clean it, man.

678
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:40,941
- 怎么弄？    - 吐口水然后擦！
- How?    - Spit and rub,

679
01:00:44,144 --> 01:00:45,220
好吧
All right

680
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:48,699
吐口水！然后擦！
Spit and rub, buddy. Spit and rub.

681
01:00:51,235 --> 01:00:54,655
好像没用，擦不掉
It's not working, it's not coming off.

682
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:02,671
给我，先把子弹拿出来
Spit and rub, Spit and rub. Here, take it out.

683
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,783
- 用你的水管夹，用水管夹擦    - 在那里？
- Use your camel, Use your camel.    -  Where is it?

684
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:08,996
你还好吧？
You all right?

685
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:10,554
就用这个
Here, use that.

686
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:15,379
深呼吸
Just breathe, buddy.

687
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:16,797
来，放松点
Come on, Just breathe in.

688
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,312
好，拿着，用它擦
Good. Here, squeeze.

689
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:21,857
- 明白了？    - 明白
- Got it?    - Yeah

690
01:01:22,725 --> 01:01:25,944
擦干净点，小子…嗯，你做的很好
Rub that olive, baby. Come on, you got it.

691
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:37,330
你做得很好，真的很棒
You're doing good, man. You're doing real good.

692
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:41,168
- 好了吗？    - 好了
- Got 'em?    - Yeah

693
01:01:41,994 --> 01:01:43,654
我会保证你没事的，伙计
I'm going to keep you safe, buddy, all right?

694
01:01:43,746 --> 01:01:45,697
我们去干掉这帮混蛋，守好你的位置
Now let's get these bastards, Scan your sectors.

695
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:47,199
守好位置
Scan your sectors.

696
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,967
杀了那个混账东西
Kill that fuckin' asshole.

697
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:00,295
狗娘养的
Son of a bitch.

698
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:14,706
漂亮！撂倒一个，另一个躲起来了
Nice, he's down. 2nd one out of range.

699
01:02:15,611 --> 01:02:17,696
屋右侧20米有一个
Twenty meters to the right of the building.

700
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:24,111
我看到了
I got him.

701
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:27,991
瞄准了就打
Fire when ready.

702
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:38,417
他跑了，他跑了，往房子方向跑
He's moving, he's moving. To the building.

703
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,919
- 跟上他，看见没？    - 看到了
- Follow him You got him?    - Got him

704
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:46,717
他也倒了
He's down.

705
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:51,772
晚安，感谢参与
Goodnight. Thanks for playing.

706
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,867
窗户，在窗边！
Window, the window. At the window,

707
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:10,716
他还在那儿
He's still there.

708
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:28,767
左边窗户，左边窗户，看到了吗？
Left window. Left window, Got him?

709
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:29,998
看到了
Got him.

710
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:50,786
打中了
He's down.

711
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:50,691
- 嘿，欧文    - 什么事
- Hey, Owen?    - Yeah?

712
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:54,056
能不能从包里拿点果汁过来？
Can you grab the juice? out of the pack please?

713
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:54,963
好的
Sure

714
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:08,997
好像喝完了
I think we're out.

715
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,996
- 有什么能喝的吗？    - 试试那个
- Got anything left to drink?    - You could try that one.

716
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:34,735
谢谢你
Thank you.

717
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:03,847
喝，喝了它
Drink, drink it.

718
01:07:07,403 --> 01:07:09,313
真安静啊
Things are real quiet.

719
01:07:09,488 --> 01:07:12,499
是啊，我可不喜欢
Yeah, I don't like it.

720
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:35,439
- 嘿，威尔    - 怎么？
- Hey, Will?    - Yeah?

721
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:38,216
在6点钟方向
At your six o'clock.

722
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,990
我看到桥上有动静！就在小路上
I see movement on the bridge. Right on the tracks.

723
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:45,407
搞定他
Well, handle it.

724
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:51,413
我该开枪吗？
Should I fire?

725
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:53,899
自己决定，伙计
It's your call, buddy.

726
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:24,596
干得好
Good job.

727
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:56,436
嘿，桑伯恩
Hey, Sanborn.

728
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:02,401
我想应该完事了
I think we're done.

729
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:17,499
你没事吧？
Okay? You all right?

730
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,380
狗东西，竟敢打队长，这就是报应
That's what you get for hitting your fucking team leader, motherfucker.

731
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,410
我马上回来，去撒尿
- Man    - I'll be right back, I gotta piss.

732
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:32,751
欧文！再喝一圈，这是命令！
Owen. Another round, boy. That's your order.

733
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:35,167
是，长官！
Well, yes, sir. Sgt, James, sir.

734
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:36,880
你不太懂相处之道吧，长官
You're not very good with people, are you, sir?

735
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:38,762
但你是名出色的勇士，杯子拿来
But you're a good warrior, Give me your mug.

736
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:40,794
喝，长官
There ya go, sir.

737
01:09:40,806 --> 01:09:44,051
你今天的实战表现非常出色，技术兵
You were well on the field of battle today, specialist.

738
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:45,794
干杯
Cheers

739
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:55,479
老了，喝不动了
Uh, I'm too old for this shit.

740
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:03,754
- 我很害怕    - 是吗？
- I was scared.    - Yeah?

741
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:07,549
每个人心里都有恐惧
Well, everyone's a coward about something, you know.

742
01:10:10,044 --> 01:10:12,666
你是好样的，真是好样的
You're good. You're real good.

743
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:14,706
看看这里有什么？
Just what do we have here?

744
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:18,252
威尔有个小宝箱
Will has possessions.

745
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:21,133
我从不知道你有这么多存货啊，威尔
I didn't know you owned anything, Will.

746
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:22,965
看看都有些什么
Let's see what you got here, Will.

747
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:26,490
这是谁？
Who is that?

748
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:27,993
是我儿子
That's my son,

749
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:32,978
他是个难惹的小家伙，不像我
he's a tough little bastard, nothing like me.

750
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:35,102
你不会是想告诉我，你结婚了吧？
You mean to tell me you married?

751
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:40,486
我曾经有个女朋友…
Well, you know, I had a girlfriend and...

752
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:43,692
后来她怀孕了，所以我们结婚了
she got pregnant, so we got married.

753
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:45,821
后来离了
We got divorced.

754
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:50,287
或者说，我认为我们已经离了
Or I thought we got divorced.

755
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:53,707
她还住在我家，她说我们还是一对
She's still living in the house. And she says we're still together,

756
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:57,541
我就糊涂了，不知道该称呼她什么
so I don't know, What does that make her?

757
01:10:57,633 --> 01:11:02,295
抱着你这种家伙不肯放 不如叫她呆瓜好了
Dumb for still being with your ass.

758
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:04,051
嘿！
Hey

759
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:05,716
她一点也不呆，听见没？
She ain't fuckin' dumb, all right?

760
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:07,259
她很忠诚
She's just loyal.

761
01:11:08,852 --> 01:11:11,680
是很忠诚…仅此而已 说说你们的事吧
She's just loyal. That's all, How 'bout you guys?

762
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:16,018
你…你有女人吗？
You got... you got a girl? What do you got?

763
01:11:16,235 --> 01:11:19,896
我的问题是，我真正爱的女人
My only problem is the girl I do like,

764
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:23,111
老是跟我谈孩子，我没辙了
I can't stop her from talking about babies, man.

765
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:25,419
那就把你的后代给她啊，种马
Well, give her your sperm, stud.

766
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,696
去吧，就这么做
Go on. Do it.

767
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:30,162
- 快点，胆小鬼，给她就行了嘛    - 不，绝对不行
- C'mon, chicken. Just give it to her.    - No! Hell no!

768
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:31,245
生孩子去
Make babies

769
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,952
我心里有数，我现在还没准备好
I know when I'm ready, and I ain't ready for that yet, I know that.

770
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:39,166
哦…看哪，这是什么？
Well, well... what do we have here?

771
01:11:40,509 --> 01:11:42,169
呃…是零件
Uh, components.

772
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:45,592
是炸弹的组件，每个都代表着一个炸弹
They're bomb parts, signatures.

773
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:47,883
是，我明白，为什么会在你床下面
Yeah, I see that, but what they doing under your bed?

774
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:51,992
呃
Well...

775
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:01,396
看这个
Ah-ha, there we go, this one...

776
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:05,738
从一幢联合国大楼拆来的
This one is from the UN building.

777
01:12:05,743 --> 01:12:09,655
爆炸车辆，人体起爆
Flaming car, dead man's switch... Boom,

778
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:11,590
这家伙人不错，我喜欢
This guy was great, I like him.

779
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,910
看看这个
Ah... Look at this one.

780
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:19,998
这来自我们第一次做的任务
This one, y'all, is from our first call together.

781
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:25,354
这盒子里的东西都曾差点要了我的命
This box is full of stuff that almost killed me.

782
01:12:25,763 --> 01:12:27,172
这又是什么呢？
And what about this one?

783
01:12:27,222 --> 01:12:29,649
- 这东西从哪儿来的，威尔？    - 这是我的结婚戒指
- Where's this one from, Will?    - It's my wedding ring.

784
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:32,569
我说了，这东西差点杀了我
Like I said, stuff that almost killed me.

785
01:12:33,771 --> 01:12:38,305
我觉得这很有趣
You know, I just think it's really interesting

786
01:12:38,317 --> 01:12:39,768
决定许多人生死权的东西 就握在你的手里
to hold something in your hand that could have killed anyone.

787
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:43,622
去你的，都是些从电子市场买来的破烂
Damn that, It's all shit from radio shack.

788
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,417
我觉得很有趣
It's interesting.

789
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:49,406
我也觉得这很有趣
I think it's interesting too.

790
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:51,160
另外，我还没对你怎么样呢
Well, I think you hit me harder than I hit you

791
01:12:51,165 --> 01:12:54,370
你就先对我下重手，不公平
therefore I owe you a punch.

792
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:56,296
快起来，混球！
Now get your ass up, C'mon.

793
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:59,538
他说的没错，起来
C'mon, He's right. Let's go, C'mon,

794
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:01,995
来啊
Come on!

795
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:04,001
好吧伙计们，我先说规则
All right, hold on, boys. We need some rules,

796
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:05,881
桑伯恩，不能打脸
Sanborn, no face shots.

797
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:06,945
喔，我非得打脸不可
Oh, there's gonna be a face shot.

798
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:08,605
詹姆斯上士，把T恤脱掉
Sergeant James, take off your shirt.

799
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:10,732
是，长官
Yes, sir.

800
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:12,251
这怎么搞的？
What happened?

801
01:13:12,393 --> 01:13:14,569
小时候被我妈摔过
My momma dropped me when I was a baby,

802
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,392
我看像弹片造成的伤疤
Looks like frag scars,

803
01:13:16,397 --> 01:13:20,684
- 让开，艾缀奇    - 好吧
- Let it go, Eldridge, C'mon,    - All right,

804
01:13:20,818 --> 01:13:22,577
来一记漂亮的重拳
Nice and big

805
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:28,692
喔~
Oohh!

806
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:37,496
很享受吧？
You like that, huh?

807
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:39,328
你就这点本事？
That's all you got?

808
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:41,079
来吧
Come on,

809
01:13:43,716 --> 01:13:45,600
打我，快！
Bring some, C'mon,

810
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:48,503
呜噢！
Ooh!

811
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:54,990
呜，爽耶！
Wooh, God damn!

812
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:56,970
够他受的
That's gotta hurt.

813
01:14:00,441 --> 01:14:02,142
- 你没事吧，伙计？    - 没事
- You all right, man?    - Oh, yeah

814
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:06,163
- 他还行    - 起来，婊子
- Oh, he's all right.    - Get up, bitch.

815
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:09,624
好了，婊子
All right, bitch.

816
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:14,408
- 看你还有什么本事？    - 滚开
- What do you got now?    - Get the fuck off me?

817
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:16,077
- 还有什么本事？    - 从我身上滚开
- What do you got?    - Get off me, you mother fucker.

818
01:14:16,082 --> 01:14:17,996
有什么？什么？
What do you got? What do you got?

819
01:14:18,001 --> 01:14:21,123
他真骚，太骚了
Wooh, he's a wild one. We got a wild one.

820
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:23,208
来，桑伯恩，对，就这样
C'mon, Sanborn. Get him. That's right.

821
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:26,962
- 骑上马儿跑啊    - 从我身上下来，变态
- Ride him, baby.    - Get off me

822
01:14:26,967 --> 01:14:28,672
- 动啊，婊子    - 好了，伙计们
- C'mon, bitch    - C'mon, guys

823
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:30,629
有啥能耐啊？
What do you got?

824
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:32,297
滚开
Get off me

825
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:33,774
好了好了
Hey, hey, hey!

826
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:46,937
我跟你开玩笑呢，小畜生
I'm just kidding, motherfucker, shit!

827
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:50,691
你不简单啊，桑伯恩
You're all right, Sanborn.

828
01:14:50,783 --> 01:14:51,737
真的不简单，兄弟
You're all right, man.

829
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:54,252
欧文，给他来点酒，去
Owen, get this guy a drink. C'mon.

830
01:14:55,788 --> 01:14:57,242
- 你扶住他    - 扶住了
- You got him?    - Yeah, I got him,

831
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:58,660
- 好，我闪了    - 好的
- All right, here.    - All right.

832
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:00,537
- 回见，当心点    - 好的
- See you later, be safe.    - All right.

833
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:03,997
好了大块头，我们走…靠，你该减肥了
All right, come on big boy. Damn, boy, you need to get on a diet.

834
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:06,665
都快站不住了…来
He hurt his knee,. C'mon, man.

835
01:15:07,883 --> 01:15:11,086
当心楼梯
Steps. C'mon.

836
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:14,840
一步，两步
Step, step.

837
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:24,766
好了，躺下，好好休息
All right, lay down. All right, Get some rest.

838
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:30,397
詹姆斯，你说我配得上这身军装么？
Hey, James, you think I got what it takes to put on the suit?

839
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:34,067
你不配
Hell, no.

840
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,237
晚安，小子
Night, boy.

841
01:16:21,625 --> 01:16:25,668
[ 距B连轮值结束日还有16天 ]

842
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:32,125
哦
Oh!

843
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:38,340
- 早上好，上校    - 早上好
- Good morning, Colonel.    - Good morning.

844
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:43,445
能捎上我么？老是干文职，闷死我了
Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death of sitting behind a desk all the time.

845
01:16:46,106 --> 01:16:48,450
- 算是给我的恩惠    - 上车吧，上校
- That'd be a privilege.    - Hop in, Colonel.

846
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:53,997
你好，医生
Hey, Doc.

847
01:16:54,573 --> 01:16:56,278
我不是想侮辱你的智商
Not to insult your intelligence, sir.

848
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:59,583
但如果遇到麻烦，请不要向车外射击
but if the shit hits the fan, please don't fire out the Humvee.

849
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:02,714
免得搬起石头砸自己的脚 有人会吃枪子的
The round will just bounce around, and someone might get shot.

850
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,343
- 我可不想吃枪子    - 明白了，上士
- I don't like getting shot.    - Understood, Sergeant,

851
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,135
这是个很常规的任务
Oh, it's a pretty standard mission.

852
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,526
我们要去处理一批爆炸军械
We're just here to pick up some unexploded ordinance.

853
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:25,862
詹姆斯上士会去现场看情况
Sergeant James is gonna see what the deal is

854
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:28,532
希望能在几分钟内搞定
and then hopefully we'll be gone in a couple minutes.

855
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:30,605
- 我们得带上装备    - 为啥？
- We've gotta gear up.    - For what?

856
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:32,094
保安部队没进去过
Security hasn't gone in.

857
01:17:32,152 --> 01:17:33,649
我们潜进去
Go in quiet.

858
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:35,792
- 把对讲机关掉    - 明白
- Radios off, Roger    - Roger that

859
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,583
- 很高兴你能来    - 小心点
- Glad you came.    - Stay safe, all right

860
01:20:42,843 --> 01:20:44,269
没人
Clear

861
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:46,213
嘿
Hey

862
01:20:46,346 --> 01:20:48,357
烟头还在冒烟
cigarette's still smoking.

863
01:20:52,061 --> 01:20:53,570
这些都是我们的了
It's all our shit.

864
01:20:56,899 --> 01:20:58,909
都堆成一座金山了
Mother fucking goldmine.

865
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:02,165
小心陷阱
Watch out for trips

866
01:21:26,178 --> 01:21:27,604
我发现了些东西
I got something

867
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:42,369
我认识这个孩子
I know this kid

868
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,747
他叫贝克汉姆，是卖DVD的
His name's Beckham. He sells DVDs,

869
01:21:46,365 --> 01:21:48,542
以前见过人肉炸弹吗？
You ever see a body bomb before, man?

870
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:53,630
太恶心了，我们走吧
It's disgusting. Let's get outta here,

871
01:21:53,997 --> 01:21:55,145
等下
Hold it.

872
01:21:56,417 --> 01:22:01,763
艾缀奇，带上所有C4塑胶炸药 引爆线能拿多少就拿多少
Eldridge, want you to grab all the C4 and deck cord you can get your hands on.

873
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:06,463
把这里的弹药都带走
Let's get all this ordnance outta here.

874
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:08,812
然后我们…我们把这儿炸了
And we're just gonna... we're gonna blow the place.

875
01:22:09,763 --> 01:22:11,481
明白，就炸了吧
Roger, Just blow it.

876
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:21,253
你们在干嘛？
What are you doing?

877
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:24,992
把这些石头搬上车运走？
Yeah? Putting the stones in to move.

878
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:27,814
很好
Yeah, that's really wonderful

879
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,192
但今天有些危险
but it's a little bit unsafe today,

880
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:34,116
是的，有些危险
Yeah, it's a little unsafe.

881
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:35,739
也许…
So maybe... I don't know.

882
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:39,264
…也许我们应该离开？
I'm thinking maybe we should move?

883
01:22:39,293 --> 01:22:40,369
不行么？
No?

884
01:22:57,186 --> 01:22:58,470
妈的！
Fuck

885
01:23:03,275 --> 01:23:04,396
- 你没事吧？    - 是的
- You all right?    - Yeah

886
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:05,852
- 你呢？    - 嗯
- You?    - Yeah

887
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:14,069
- 没事吧？    - 嗯
- You all right, man?    - Yeah

888
01:23:15,079 --> 01:23:16,630
周围没人了吧
No one in or out, okay?

889
01:23:58,872 --> 01:24:00,841
取消引爆，取消引爆
Cancel the det, Cancel the det.

890
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:25,282
- 他在干嘛？    - 我不知道
- What the fuck is he doing?    - I don't know, man.

891
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:28,535
我不知道
I don't know.

892
01:25:56,907 --> 01:25:58,250
我出来了
I'm coming out.

893
01:25:59,076 --> 01:26:00,444
收到
Roger that.

894
01:26:20,806 --> 01:26:22,841
- 你从哪里来？    - 纽约
- Where are you from?    - New York.

895
01:26:22,975 --> 01:26:24,343
就是“大苹果”(纽约昵称)
The Big Apple.

896
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:26,428
我是伊拉克来的
I'm from Iraq

897
01:26:26,437 --> 01:26:28,600
我喜欢这里，这里很漂亮
I love it here. This is a beautiful place.

898
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:31,019
但是这里不太安全
But it's not too safe here, okay?

899
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:34,995
所以我认为我们应该离开
So, I think we need - we need to move, please.

900
01:26:58,969 --> 01:27:00,671
那个是营地旁的小孩么？
You think it's that little Beckham?

901
01:27:00,763 --> 01:27:02,481
不，我不这么想
No, I don't.

902
01:27:02,723 --> 01:27:05,359
- 你肯定么？    - 当然肯定
- You're positive?    - Sure.

903
01:27:05,726 --> 01:27:08,320
我不知道，他们看上去都一样
Hey, I don't know, man. They all look the same, right?

904
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:09,641
我不知道
I don't know.

905
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:13,325
- 威尔似乎很肯定，真是奇怪    - 非常奇怪
- Will seemed sure. That was weird.    - Very weird.

906
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:18,063
请…离开…
Please, just move.

907
01:27:18,197 --> 01:27:20,611
走，走
Move, Move.

908
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:25,404
离开…多谢
Move on. Thank you.

909
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:29,908
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

910
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:31,997
威尔这人很怪
Will's very weird.

911
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:34,611
把炸弹零件收在床下面
I mean he keeps bomb parts under his bed.

912
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:37,821
我打赌，今天的炸弹零件 他可不会收在床下面
I'll bet you he won't keep any of these parts under his bed.

913
01:27:39,718 --> 01:27:40,919
再见
Bye-bye

914
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:45,173
再见，谢谢
Yeah, bye-bye. Bye, thank you.

915
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:47,217
喂，上校
Hey, Colonel

916
01:27:47,851 --> 01:27:48,722
我们走
Let's go

917
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:51,346
再见，谢谢
So long, thank you.

918
01:27:58,404 --> 01:27:59,980
土制炸弹！
IED!

919
01:28:01,407 --> 01:28:02,649
坎布里奇！
Cambridge!

920
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:08,909
回来，趴下
Get back, get down

921
01:28:08,914 --> 01:28:10,494
呆在后面
Stay back

922
01:28:10,499 --> 01:28:12,801
呆在后面，桑伯恩！让他们呆着别动
Stay back, Sanborn, keep 'em back

923
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:14,164
有人受伤吗？
Is anyone hurt?

924
01:28:14,169 --> 01:28:16,997
坎布里奇！妈的
Cambridge! Fuck!

925
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:19,349
坎布里奇在哪儿？
Where's Cambridge!

926
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:21,797
坎布里奇快点，我们要走了！
Cambridge, come out, We gotta go.

927
01:28:21,802 --> 01:28:23,086
上帝啊，他死了
Oh, he's dead.

928
01:28:23,762 --> 01:28:26,486
得找到坎布里奇！医生！
Hey, we gotta find Cambridge, Doc!

929
01:28:26,515 --> 01:28:29,287
- 艾缀奇    - 医生！
- Eldridge!    - Doc!

930
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:32,641
艾缀奇，来，过来
Eldridge, c'mon, man, C'mon

01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:34,727
刚才还看见他，从那边走过来…
I just saw him. He was walking right here.

932
01:28:34,732 --> 01:28:38,285
我知道，他已经死了，听着，他死了！
I know. He's dead. Look, he's dead, Okay?

933
01:28:51,999 --> 01:28:53,328
没事了，伙计
It's all right, man.

934
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,577
会好的，伙计
It'll be all right, man,.

935
01:29:19,068 --> 01:29:20,227
喂…
Hello?

936
01:29:22,237 --> 01:29:23,522
喂？
Hello?

937
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,607
威尔？

938
01:29:27,576 --> 01:29:28,735
喂？
Hello?

939
01:29:31,789 --> 01:29:33,490
喂？
Hello?

940
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:26,543
我有个问题问你
Hey, let me ask you a question,

941
01:30:26,635 --> 01:30:29,383
原来在这里工作的孩子去哪里了？
What happened to the little kid? that used to work here?

942
01:30:29,388 --> 01:30:32,970
对不起，我不会说英语
Sorry, man, English I... no English.

943
01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:36,306
你不会说英语？
No-no English, You no speak English now.

944
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:39,560
那孩子叫贝克汉姆，卖DVD的
Little kid, Beckham is his name. He sells... sells DVDs,

945
01:30:39,565 --> 01:30:42,396
买DVD？1张DVD五元
DVD, One DVD, $5,

946
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:43,936
上帝啊
Oh, Jesus Christ.

947
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:45,771
- 五元钱    - 打扰一下
- $5    - Excuse me, soldier.

948
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:47,151
士兵，你是管这里的？
you in charge of this area here?

949
01:30:47,156 --> 01:30:49,333
- 怎么了？    - 你认识这个人？
- What's up?    - You know this guy?

950
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:52,489
如果这个人给叛乱分子提供情报
How do we know that he's not giving intel to insurgents

951
01:30:52,494 --> 01:30:54,158
告诉他们迫击炮往哪儿打，怎么办？
, telling them where to drop mortars?

952
01:30:54,163 --> 01:30:55,659
他只是个卖DVD的
I think he's just selling DVDs.

953
01:30:55,664 --> 01:30:57,549
这关乎安全问题，该把他赶走
Well, he's a security risk, We should get rid of him.

954
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,288
看什么看？
What are you looking at?

955
01:30:59,293 --> 01:31:02,750
- 他只是个卖DVD的 这里所有商贩都是清白的    - 谁负责？
- He's just selling DVDs, man. All the merchants are clear.    - By who?

956
01:31:02,755 --> 01:31:05,265
没有上司命令，我不能对他采取任何行动
I couldn't do anything with him without the say-so from my CO.

957
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:09,086
好吧，妈的
Okay, Fuck

958
01:31:10,471 --> 01:31:12,214
妈的
Fuck

959
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:49,626
是不是不一样了？
Does this change anything?

960
01:31:50,677 --> 01:31:52,087
现在你会说英语了，是不是？
You speak English now. Don't you?

961
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:54,798
- 开车！    - 好的
- Yalla, yalla, drive!    - Okay

962
01:32:16,495 --> 01:32:18,530
- 到了    - 是这栋房子？
- OK    - Is this his house?

963
01:32:18,789 --> 01:32:20,282
贝克汉姆的家？
Beckham's house?

964
01:32:28,924 --> 01:32:30,000
在这等着
Wait here

965
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:41,011
妈的
Fuck

966
01:33:39,828 --> 01:33:41,780
嘘…
Psst, psst, shh.

967
01:33:42,748 --> 01:33:44,116
你说英语吗？
You speak English?

968
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:45,996
英语，法语，阿拉伯语我都会
English, French, Arabic.

969
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:47,327
好，背心掀开
Good, Open you vest.

970
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:50,581
呆在那儿，停
Ah, stay there. Stay.

971
01:33:51,131 --> 01:33:52,891
把贝克汉姆的事情告诉我
Tell me what you know about Beckham.

972
01:33:53,092 --> 01:33:54,245
谁？
For whom?

973
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:57,813
贝克汉姆，12岁的男孩，人肉炸弹 呆着那儿别动
Beckham, 12-year-old boy, body bomb. Stay right there

974
01:33:58,222 --> 01:34:00,344
- 我不知道    - 你不知道？
- I don't know    - You don't know

975
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:03,802
请先坐下，我是内韦德教授
But please, sit down. I am Professor Navid,

976
01:34:03,977 --> 01:34:05,470
这是我家
This is my home.

977
01:34:05,854 --> 01:34:09,141
你来了就是客人，请坐吧
You are a guest. Please, sit down.

978
01:34:11,527 --> 01:34:13,186
我是客人？
I'm a guest?

979
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:19,610
只是…我在找相关的人
Just... I'm looking for the people responsible

980
01:34:20,828 --> 01:34:22,779
认识贝克汉姆的
for-for-for Beckham,

981
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:25,616
你是中情局的？
You are CIA, no?

982
01:34:26,709 --> 01:34:29,244
有中情局的人来我家，我很高兴
I am very pleased to see CIA in my home.

983
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:31,705
请坐吧
Please, sit.

984
01:34:38,971 --> 01:34:40,505
怎么才能…
How can I...

985
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:46,595
当心，枪会走火！
Be careful, the gun can go off.

986
01:35:43,702 --> 01:35:45,449
我是美国军人
USA friendly coming in.

987
01:35:45,454 --> 01:35:48,286
站住！跪下！
Stop! Stop! Get the fuck down!

988
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:49,787
我是美国人！
USA friendly,.

989
01:35:49,792 --> 01:35:52,331
跪下！快跪下
On your knees, Get on your knees now.

990
01:35:52,336 --> 01:35:56,502
跪下！否则就开枪了，不许动！
On your knees. You will be shot. Don't move.

991
01:35:56,507 --> 01:35:58,253
跪下！快
On your knees. Down now.

992
01:35:58,258 --> 01:36:01,882
- 掀开外套！    - 我掀了
- Open your jacket!    - Opening my jacket,

993
01:36:01,887 --> 01:36:03,852
把他摁在地上
Cover. Get him down,

994
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:05,282
- 跪下    - 我有武器
- On the ground,    - I have a weapon

995
01:36:05,307 --> 01:36:07,175
不许动！
Don't fucking move

996
01:36:07,393 --> 01:36:09,403
- 塔楼，掩护我，我来搜他    - 我有武器
- Tower, hold cover. Searching.    - I have a weapon.

997
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:12,781
- 有枪！    - 我早说过了
- Gun.    - Like I said,.

998
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:15,309
武器已收缴！
Weapons clear.

999
01:36:15,442 --> 01:36:16,602
身份证
ID

1000
01:36:17,194 --> 01:36:18,687
你他妈去干嘛了？
What the fuck are you doing?

1001
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:20,314
我去嫖妓了
I was at a whorehouse.

1002
01:36:20,948 --> 01:36:26,028
好，我让你进去，你告诉我妓院在哪里
All right, If I let you in, will you tell me where it is exactly?

1003
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:28,780
好…
Yeah

1004
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:33,160
詹姆斯，你听到了吗？
James, do you copy?

1005
01:36:42,511 --> 01:36:44,438
詹姆斯，你在听嘛？
James, do you have your ears on?

1006
01:36:47,975 --> 01:36:49,009
詹姆斯？
James?

1007
01:36:50,894 --> 01:36:52,471
是我，怎么了？
This is James, What's up?

1008
01:37:08,078 --> 01:37:10,405
- 嘿    - 怎么了，伙计？
- Hey    - What's up, man?

1009
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:15,497
有个油罐在巴格达“绿区”爆炸了 （由美军重点控制的安全区）
Look, we have a tank explosion in the Green Zone.

1010
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:17,249
要我们去做爆后评估
We have to post-blast assessment,

1011
01:37:17,254 --> 01:37:18,709
看看是不是自杀性爆炸
see if it was a suicide bomber,

1012
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:20,557
如果是，再调查一下爆炸手法
and if so, how the fuck did he do it?

1013
01:37:21,341 --> 01:37:22,292
好
Okay.

1014
01:37:22,885 --> 01:37:24,336
你说你刚才去哪里了？
Where'd you say you were again?

1015
01:37:24,762 --> 01:37:26,271
我没说过…我们走
I didn't, sergeant. Let's go.

1016
01:37:28,599 --> 01:37:30,442
你的头怎么了，詹姆斯？
What happened to your head, James?

1017
01:37:37,733 --> 01:37:39,117
你准备好了吗？
Hey, you ready?

1018
01:37:39,651 --> 01:37:41,103
把护盔给我，老弟，要上路了
Game face, buddy. Let's go.

1019
01:37:46,742 --> 01:37:48,739
- 准备好了吗？    - 好了
- You ready?    - Let's do this.

1020
01:37:48,744 --> 01:37:50,862
好，我们上路了
Rock and roll. Moving out.

1021
01:38:04,343 --> 01:38:06,461
我们是美国友军！
USA friendlies coming through.

1022
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:28,834
让一让，让一让！
Make room, guys. Make room.

1023
01:38:41,171 --> 01:38:43,382
喂，桑伯恩
Hey, Sanborn.

1024
01:38:43,966 --> 01:38:45,125
妈的
Oh, shit!

1025
01:38:50,013 --> 01:38:52,583
叫医生来！叫医生来！
Get a medic! Get a medic!

1026
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:13,420
- 是个油罐？    - 是的
- An oil tanker?    - Yep,

1027
01:39:16,707 --> 01:39:18,325
飞了好长一段路啊
That's a pretty long flight, huh?

1028
01:41:25,919 --> 01:41:27,996
爆炸一直蔓延到这里
This is the edge of the blast radius.

1029
01:41:33,886 --> 01:41:35,462
上帝啊
Jesus.

1030
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:37,923
袭击者呢？
So, where's our triggerman?

1031
01:41:38,015 --> 01:41:39,841
已经烧没了
Burnt up in the flames, man.

1032
01:41:40,184 --> 01:41:41,843
自杀式人肉炸弹
Suicide bomber.

1033
01:41:42,144 --> 01:41:44,503
根本别想找到半点尸骨
We're never going to find a body in that shit.

1034
01:41:44,521 --> 01:41:46,139
如果不是肉体引爆
What if there was no body?

1035
01:41:47,733 --> 01:41:49,351
而是遥控引爆呢
What if it was a remote det?

1036
01:41:53,989 --> 01:41:56,708
有个大坏蛋就藏在暗处
A really good bad guy hides out in the dark, right?

1037
01:41:59,578 --> 01:42:03,590
就在那儿，地势绝佳
Right here. Perfect vantage point,

1038
01:42:03,874 --> 01:42:08,303
隔岸观火，看着我们收拾残局
outside the blast radius to sit back and watch us clean up their mess.

1039
01:42:10,798 --> 01:42:12,849
- 想过去吗？    - 正想如此
- Want to go out there?    - Yes, I do

1040
01:42:15,094 --> 01:42:19,298
- 这一去定会惹出些麻烦    - 不，伙计，你在胡搞
- I could stand to get in a little trouble.    - No, man. This is bullshit.

1041
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:23,972
我们连有3个步兵排 他们的职责就是猎杀伊斯兰佬
You got three infantry platoons behind you whose job it is to go Haji huntin'.

1042
01:42:23,977 --> 01:42:25,183
这活不该我们干！
That ain't our fuckin' job.

1043
01:42:25,188 --> 01:42:28,018
你没权驳我，桑伯恩，而我有权驳你
You don't say no to me, Sanborn. I say no to you.

1044
01:42:28,023 --> 01:42:30,187
你知道，那里有群人正在看着我们
You know there are guys watching us right now.

1045
01:42:30,192 --> 01:42:33,787
他们正在乐呢…对此我觉得很不爽
They're laughing at this, Okay, I'm not okay with that.

1046
01:42:34,405 --> 01:42:37,457
关了你的破手电筒，我们要过去了
Now, turn off your god dammed torch 'cause we're going.

1047
01:43:46,643 --> 01:43:48,515
现在知道那油罐是从哪儿来的了
Now we know where their oil tanker came from.

1048
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,184
靠，同一型号的
No shit. Same kind.

1049
01:43:50,189 --> 01:43:52,015
- 我们快到了    - 没错
- We're close    - Yeah

1050
01:43:52,107 --> 01:43:53,979
这些小巷应该是纵横交错的
The alley ways are probably set up on a grid.

1051
01:43:53,984 --> 01:43:56,762
我们必须分路行动，把他们赶出来
We're going to need to spit up, flush 'em out.

1052
01:43:57,154 --> 01:43:59,651
桑伯恩你走第一条，艾缀奇走第二条
Sanborn, you take one, Eldridge, take two,

1053
01:43:59,656 --> 01:44:02,655
我走第三条，在你的路口集合
I got three. Rally point at your intersection.

1054
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:04,336
- 好了，行动    - 等等，什么时候集合？
- Ready, move    - Wait, rally point when?

1055
01:44:05,287 --> 01:44:06,238
妈的
Fuck

1056
01:44:32,773 --> 01:44:34,449
走开，走开！
''Ipsura, ipsura,'' Go, go!

1057
01:45:19,903 --> 01:45:21,980
该死！
Shit, Ahh.

1058
01:45:28,328 --> 01:45:29,241
妈的
Shit

1059
01:45:29,246 --> 01:45:31,535
- 你遇敌了？    - 是谁？出了什么事？
- You got contact?    - Who was it? What's going on?

1060
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:33,533
- 什么情况？    - 是艾缀奇
- What do you got?    - It's Eldridge.

1061
01:45:34,877 --> 01:45:35,998
走， 走！
Go, go.

1062
01:45:36,003 --> 01:45:37,763
人员伤亡，人员伤亡
Man down! Man down!

1063
01:45:38,756 --> 01:45:40,374
该死，该死!
Shit, Shit, Shit!

1064
01:45:40,466 --> 01:45:43,560
- 哦不不，不是他，不是他    - 他离开了
- Negative, negative. It's not him.    - He's gone.

1065
01:45:43,719 --> 01:45:45,007
他们去哪儿了？他们去哪儿了？
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

1066
01:45:45,012 --> 01:45:47,130
油罐车和大部队在那边
Tankers and troops are that way.

1067
01:45:47,222 --> 01:45:48,924

- Let's go this way.    - Fuck

1068

我数到三，你开手电
Use your torch, On three.

1069

准备好

01:46:17,753 --> 01:46:20,330
1…2…3
One, two, three.

1071
01:46:22,466 --> 01:46:23,975
- 妈的    - 见鬼
- Fuck!    - Shit

1072
01:46:29,473 --> 01:46:31,441
轻点，轻点，轻点
Softy, softy, softy.

1073
01:46:42,486 --> 01:46:43,582
我数到3
On three

1074
01:46:43,737 --> 01:46:45,792
1…2…3…
One, Two, Three

1075
01:46:49,868 --> 01:46:51,920
快过去！
Now! Go, go, go...

1076
01:46:54,289 --> 01:46:57,247
- 艾缀奇，你还好吗？    - 妈的，我受伤了
- Eldridge, you okay?    - Fuck, dude, I'm hit.

1077
01:46:57,252 --> 01:46:59,206
他的腿被打伤了
Hit him in the fuckin' leg.

1078
01:46:59,211 --> 01:47:01,208
撑住！撑住！
Come on

1079
01:47:01,213 --> 01:47:04,975
- 我是不是快死了？    - 不，你没事的，老弟
- Am I dead? Am I dead?    - No, You're fine, man.

1080
01:47:05,175 --> 01:47:07,227
我快死了，我快死了
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1081
01:47:08,554 --> 01:47:10,689
我要压住它
I'm going to put some pressure down. Come on.

1082
01:47:10,806 --> 01:47:12,232
你会没事的
You're all right.

1083
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:15,550
看着我，看着我！你会没事的
Look at me, look at me, You all right.

1084
01:47:15,644 --> 01:47:20,198
好了，我数到3，你站起来 准备好，1…2…3…
All right, buddy. You ready to get up? On three, ready? One, two, three

1085
01:48:42,564 --> 01:48:45,976
嘿，你好，伙计
Hey, what's up, man? What's up, man?

1086
01:48:45,984 --> 01:48:48,245
排爆男，要买DVD么？ 想踢球么？
Wanna buy some DVDs? Wanna play some soccer?

1087
01:48:49,488 --> 01:48:50,656
怎么了？
What's up?

1088
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:52,699
来啊，伙计，来玩…
Come on, man. Wanna play some...

1089
01:49:10,134 --> 01:49:12,394
啊 妈的
Aww, Fuck.

1090
01:49:17,558 --> 01:49:18,817
你怎么样，老弟？
How you doing, buddy?

1091
01:49:19,226 --> 01:49:21,011
医生说你会没事的
Doc says you're going to be okay.

1092
01:49:21,145 --> 01:49:23,947
我的大腿骨断成了9段
My fucking femur is shattered in nine places.

1093
01:49:24,857 --> 01:49:27,938
要是在6个月后能走 我他妈就算走运了
He said I'll be walking in six months if I'm fucking lucky.

1094
01:49:27,943 --> 01:49:30,579
- 6个月还好啊    - 还好？
- Six months ain't bad, huh?    - It's not bad?

1095
01:49:30,612 --> 01:49:32,443
我靠你老母啊
Fuckin' sucks, man,

1096
01:49:32,448 --> 01:49:34,459
喂，轻点
- Ah, ah! Take it easy,

1097
01:49:36,285 --> 01:49:39,349
看见没？你看见没？
You see that? You fuckin' see that?

1098
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:42,966
你想请别人吃枪子，结果就成了这样
That's what happens when you shoot someone, you motherfucker.

1099
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:44,618
对不起
Sorry

1100
01:49:45,002 --> 01:49:47,287
- 对不起，欧文    - 去你妈的，威尔
- Sorry, Owen.    - Fuck you, Will.

1101
01:49:47,504 --> 01:49:49,039
就是这意思，去你妈的！
Really, Fuck you.

1102
01:49:49,882 --> 01:49:53,797
谢谢你救了我的命 但我们不该去那里找麻烦！
Thanks for saving my life, but we didn't have to go out.

1103
01:49:53,802 --> 01:49:56,938
就为了满足你的个人冲动，你个混球！
Looking for trouble to get your fucking adrenaline fix, you fuck.

1104
01:49:58,724 --> 01:50:00,554
好好照顾自己，欧文
Hey, take care of yourself, Owen.

1105
01:50:00,559 --> 01:50:02,181
祝你平安归来，伙计
Come home safe, man.

1106
01:50:02,186 --> 01:50:04,346
- 回家再见，伙计    - 好的
- See you on the other side, man.    - All right

1107
01:50:05,314 --> 01:50:07,574
让我们离开这该死的沙漠！
Let's get out of this fucking desert!

1108
01:50:13,447 --> 01:50:14,526
别动！
Don't move

1109
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:17,654
如果你再往前走，我们只好开枪了！
If you keep walking we will shoot you.

1110
01:50:17,659 --> 01:50:19,570
让他退回去
Move him back

1111
01:50:20,371 --> 01:50:21,950
把那翻译拉回来！
Keep that translator back

1112
01:50:21,955 --> 01:50:23,994
- 那炸弹不是他自己装在身上的    - 把他拉回来
- But the bomb was forced on him.    - Get him back!

1113
01:50:23,999 --> 01:50:26,015
站在原地别动！
Don't move! Stay still

1114
01:50:26,020 --> 01:50:28,082
[ 距B连轮值结束日还有2天 ]

1115
01:50:28,087 --> 01:50:32,336
如果你再往前走，我们只好开枪了！
If you keep walking we will shoot you. If you keep walking we will shoot.

1116
01:50:32,341 --> 01:50:34,084
快把那个翻译拉回来！
Get that translator back, now!

1117
01:50:37,846 --> 01:50:42,050
让一让，让一让！
Give him room, give him room.

1118
01:50:49,233 --> 01:50:50,854
嘿，什么情况？
Hey, what do you got?

1119
01:50:50,859 --> 01:50:52,398
他自己来到我们检查站
He came walking up to our checkpoint,

1120
01:50:52,403 --> 01:50:55,234
说自己身上绑着炸弹 但他不想让炸弹爆炸
said he had a bomb strapped to him, But he's sorry, doesn't want it to go off.

1121
01:50:55,239 --> 01:50:57,399
所以求我们拆除炸弹
Then he starts begging us to take it off of him.

1122
01:50:57,533 --> 01:50:59,154
帮帮他，他不是坏人！
Help this man, he's not a bad man.

1123
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:01,997
他不是坏人？他绑着炸弹！
He's not a bad man? He got a bomb strapped to him,

1124
01:51:02,663 --> 01:51:04,619
他在逗我们，想让我们靠近他
This is a joke, he's trying to pull us closer.

1125
01:51:04,624 --> 01:51:06,116
好了，我明白了
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

1126
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:10,679
好，告诉他，让他慢慢地解开衣服
All right, look... Tell him to open his shirt slowly

1127
01:51:10,879 --> 01:51:13,265
我要看看里面是什么
and see what's inside.

1128
01:51:16,343 --> 01:51:18,762
慢点，慢点
Slowly, slowly...

1129
01:51:29,273 --> 01:51:30,899
啊，天哪！
Jesus

1130
01:51:31,984 --> 01:51:34,356
好了中士，让这些人离开75米远
All right Sergeant, I need a 75-meter perimeter.

1131
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:36,872
- 让他们退后    - 离开75米，往后退！
- Get these guys back.    - Give me 75 meters. Get back.

1132
01:51:38,323 --> 01:51:41,293
你告诉他，让他跪下，手举起来
You tell him to get on his knees and touch the sky, okay?

1133
01:51:42,036 --> 01:51:43,287
慢一些
Slowly

1134
01:51:43,996 --> 01:51:44,998
跪下！
Get down

1135
01:51:49,293 --> 01:51:51,295
好，我要用你的无线电
Okay, I need your radio.

1136
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:53,417
- 能不能射杀了他？    - 不行
- Can't we just shoot him?    - No

1137
01:51:53,422 --> 01:51:55,461
他是个有家室的人，不是坏人
He's a family man. He's not a bad man.

1138
01:51:55,466 --> 01:51:57,296
他只想求助，求我们帮忙
He's asking for help, only help.

1139
01:51:57,301 --> 01:52:02,105
好了，如果你不想死，就退到后面去！ 我已经知道了
Yeah, all right. You don't want to die, get back! I got it.

1140
01:52:05,309 --> 01:52:08,136
听着，我知道我们有分歧
Listen, I know we've had our differences.

1141
01:52:08,145 --> 01:52:12,532
这种事情总难免，但都已经过去了
It happened, all right. It's water under the bridge.

1142
01:52:13,776 --> 01:52:15,952
但你现在是去自杀，伙计
This is suicide, man.

1143
01:52:17,237 --> 01:52:19,289
所以才称为自杀炸弹嘛
That's why they call it a suicide bomb, right?

1144
01:52:23,077 --> 01:52:24,239
我们来搞定它吧
Let's do this. Come on.

1145
01:52:24,244 --> 01:52:26,630
他说炸弹上可能设置了定时器 请快点！
He says the bomb may have a timer, please hurry.

1146
01:52:27,456 --> 01:52:29,408
- 我好了，你好了吗？    - 好了
- We're good, Ready?    - Yep

1147
01:52:34,922 --> 01:52:35,886
去吧
Go get 'em

1148
01:52:35,964 --> 01:52:37,117
- 开始了    - 回见
- Let's do it    - See you

1149
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:38,350
- 注意狙击手    - 好的
- Watch the snipper huh!    - Yeah!

1150
01:52:49,561 --> 01:52:51,722
举起手！
Get your hands up

1151
01:52:54,692 --> 01:52:56,184
他说他有家庭
He says he has a family

1152
01:52:57,569 --> 01:52:58,896
请帮帮他
Please help him,

1153
01:53:04,785 --> 01:53:06,782
听好了
Now, listen

1154
01:53:06,787 --> 01:53:09,910
如果我要拆炸弹，比较简单的方法是
Look, It'd be a lot easier for me to disarm this

1155
01:53:09,915 --> 01:53:11,959
先把你杀了，你明白吗？
if I just shoot you. Do you understand?

1156
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:17,668
他说什么？
What's he saying?

1157
01:53:17,673 --> 01:53:21,852
他说他不想死，他还有家 请你把这东西从他身上拿下来
He says I don't wish to die, I have a family... Please take this off me.

1158
01:53:22,428 --> 01:53:27,149
告诉他，把手放在头后面 否则我很想开枪打他
Tell him to put his hands behind his head or I'll be very happy to shoot him.

1159
01:53:32,896 --> 01:53:34,393
我不是这么说的
Look, that's not what I said.

1160
01:53:34,398 --> 01:53:38,118
告诉他，把手放在头后面 否则就毙了他
Tell him to put his hands behind his head or I will shoot him.

1161
01:53:40,696 --> 01:53:41,772
听着
Listen

1162
01:53:44,116 --> 01:53:45,275
听着，听着
Listen, listen.

1163
01:53:46,535 --> 01:53:50,405
你听明白了？
You understand?

1164
01:53:52,583 --> 01:53:53,575
好
Okay

1165
01:53:57,046 --> 01:53:58,288
看看有什么？
What do you got here?

1166
01:53:59,757 --> 01:54:01,333
他有四个孩子
He has four children.

1167
01:54:06,513 --> 01:54:07,839
见鬼
Shit

1168
01:54:12,394 --> 01:54:15,852
桑伯恩，这有个计时器，还有很多线
Sanborn, we got a timer, and we got a lot of wires, man.

1169
01:54:15,857 --> 01:54:18,020
我需要帮助
I'm going to need a little help on this.

1170
01:54:18,025 --> 01:54:19,826
收到，告诉我，你要什么？
Roger that, tell me what you need.

1171
01:54:20,069 --> 01:54:21,378
我要钳子
Bolt cutters

1172
01:54:21,403 --> 01:54:23,942
最好在2分钟内给我，不然就完了
You gotta get down here in two minutes or we're all fucked.

1173
01:54:23,947 --> 01:54:25,649
收到，30秒内给你
Roger that, I'll be there in 30 seconds.

1174
01:54:29,495 --> 01:54:31,780
他说求求你  我有个家庭
He says, please, I have a family.

1175
01:54:34,375 --> 01:54:35,245
嘘
Sst

1176
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:39,438
我知道，没事的，你会好的，会好的
I know, it's okay. You're all right. You're all right.

1177
01:54:43,801 --> 01:54:45,210
别离开我
Please, don't leave me.

1178
01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:52,092
你没在开玩笑吧
You weren't fuckin' kidding.

1179
01:54:52,351 --> 01:54:55,053
没有…这是什么做的？
Nope, What's this made out of?

1180
01:55:00,693 --> 01:55:01,752
老天
Oh, man

1181
01:55:01,777 --> 01:55:03,829
这玩意儿和钢一样硬
This case's harder than steel

1182
01:55:05,197 --> 01:55:06,485
该死
Shit

1183
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:08,994
- 还有多久？    - 还有2分钟    - 妈的
- What's our time?    - We got two minutes    - Shit

1184
01:55:09,159 --> 01:55:11,657
得用焊枪才行
We're going need a torch to get this off.

1185
01:55:11,662 --> 01:55:13,701
我们车里可没那玩意儿
Well, we don't have one of those in the fucking truck, man.

1186
01:55:13,706 --> 01:55:14,410
他死定了，伙计
He's dead, man.

1187
01:55:14,415 --> 01:55:15,908
慢着，让我想想，让我想想
Hold on, man. Let me think. Just Let me think.

1188
01:55:15,999 --> 01:55:18,719
我们会搞定的，没问题，想想…
We're going to handle this. It's okay. We got this,

1189
01:55:19,169 --> 01:55:20,954
嘘，别吵
Shh, okay.

1190
01:55:21,839 --> 01:55:23,290
听着，你先退开
Now listen, you're gonna get back.

1191
01:55:27,678 --> 01:55:30,297
我们时间不够了，桑伯恩
It's just we don't got enough time, Sanborn.

1192
01:55:30,347 --> 01:55:32,941
我打算…我打算把这些锁拧断
I just gotta... I gotta get these bolts off.

1193
01:55:33,434 --> 01:55:36,724
不，我们还有1分半钟，必须离开这儿
No, We got a minute and a half, man. We gotta get out of here.

1194
01:55:36,729 --> 01:55:39,560
- 这里我来处理，你快走    - 少来了，伙计
- I'll handle this. Just go.    - Come on, man.

1195
01:55:39,565 --> 01:55:41,396
我马上就来，你先走吧
Look, I'm right behind ya. Just go.

1196
01:55:41,401 --> 01:55:43,188
去他的，我们快走！
Fuck him! Come on, Let's go,

1197
01:55:43,193 --> 01:55:46,025
- 桑伯恩！我有防护衣，你快走！    - 詹姆斯！
- Sanborn, I got the suit. Just go,    - James!

1198
01:55:46,030 --> 01:55:50,067
桑伯恩，还有45秒 你有45秒钟，离开！
Sanborn, you have 45 seconds. You have 45 seconds. Sanborn, Leave,

1199
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,905
你死定了，死定了
You're fucking dead, man. Dead.

1200
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:53,991
走！
Go!

1201
01:55:53,996 --> 01:55:56,798
- 所有人往后退！    - 走，走！
- Everybody get back!    - Go, go!

1202
01:56:02,046 --> 01:56:03,455
拆掉了一个
We got one.

1203
01:56:04,173 --> 01:56:06,667
走，退后！
Go, get back.

1204
01:56:09,178 --> 01:56:14,399
不行，锁太多了，太多了，我干不了
I can't. There's too many locks. There's too many, I can't do it,

1205
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:16,593
我没法全弄掉，对不起了
I can't get it off. I'm sorry, Okay!

1206
01:56:16,685 --> 01:56:18,262
明白嘛？我很抱歉，
You understand? I'm sorry,

1207
01:56:19,063 --> 01:56:21,852
对不起，对不起
I'm sorry. You hear me? I'm sorry,

1208
01:56:21,857 --> 01:56:24,276
- 快趴下    - 我去帮他
- Get down now!    - I can help him.

1209
01:56:26,862 --> 01:56:30,294
大家趴下！
Everybody stay down!

1210
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:54,256
詹姆斯！
James!

1211
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:56,775
大家都起来，詹姆斯！
Everybody up and out, James!

1212
01:57:43,147 --> 01:57:44,398
你还好吧？
You all right?

1213
01:57:47,693 --> 01:57:48,810
哦，伙计
Aw, man,

1214
01:57:51,697 --> 01:57:53,665
我真他妈讨厌这鬼地方
I fuckin' hate this place.

1215
01:57:56,285 --> 01:57:57,836
给你，喝一口
Here, man. Have a hit.

1216
01:58:12,009 --> 01:58:14,311
我还没准备死呢，詹姆斯
I'm not ready to die, James.

1217
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:18,357
你不会死在这里的，兄弟
Well, you're not going to die out here, bro.

1218
01:58:19,725 --> 01:58:21,510
就差2英寸
Another two inches.

1219
01:58:24,313 --> 01:58:27,282
弹片呼啸而过，然后把我的喉咙割破
Shrapnel zings by, slices my throat.

1220
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:31,411
我会像头猪一样，在沙漠里流血不止
I bleed out like a pig in the sand,

1221
01:58:33,697 --> 01:58:35,791
没有人会在乎我
Nobody'll give a shit.

1222
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:41,995
我父母当然会在意，但他们不能算 老兄，还会有谁在意呢？
I mean, my parents'll care, but they don't count, man, Who else?

1223
01:58:49,505 --> 01:58:51,298
我连儿子都没有
I don't even have a son.

1224
01:58:57,971 --> 01:59:00,495
想生儿子，你有的是时间，朋友
Well, you're going to have plenty of time for that, amigo.

1225
01:59:00,974 --> 01:59:03,051
- 不，伙计    - 这你知道
- Naw, man    - You know?

1226
01:59:04,853 --> 01:59:06,138
我不想干了
I'm done,

1227
01:59:11,485 --> 01:59:12,978
我想要个儿子
I want a son,

1228
01:59:16,907 --> 01:59:18,951
我想要个小男孩，威尔
I want a little boy, Will.

1229
01:59:25,666 --> 01:59:28,076
我想知道，你是怎么做的
I mean, how do you do it, you know?

1230
01:59:29,712 --> 01:59:31,388
去冒那样的风险？
Take the risk?

1231
01:59:38,929 --> 01:59:41,398
我不知道，我只是…
I don't know, I just...

1232
01:59:43,851 --> 01:59:45,319
我只是从来不去想
I guess I don't think about it.

1233
01:59:58,782 --> 02:00:01,376
但是当你每次穿上拆弹服
But you realize every time you suit up,

1234
02:00:02,453 --> 02:00:04,212
每次我们出勤
every time we go out

1235
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:07,841
就会面对死亡 你赌上自己的命
it's life or death. You roll the dice

1236
02:00:09,877 --> 02:00:11,345
去处理这些事情
and you deal with it.

1237
02:00:13,589 --> 02:00:15,474
这些你都清楚，是不是？
You recognize that, don't you?

1238
02:00:20,971 --> 02:00:22,256
是的
Yeah

1239
02:00:32,274 --> 02:00:33,725
是这样没错
Yeah, I do.

1240
02:00:35,402 --> 02:00:37,062
但我不知道为什么
But I don't know why.

1241
02:00:39,031 --> 02:00:40,357
对
Yeah.

1242
02:00:49,833 --> 02:00:54,429
我不知道…知道我为什么会这样？
I don't know, JT. You know why I am the way I am?

1243
02:00:59,927 --> 02:01:01,211
我不知道
Naw, I don't.

1244
02:02:03,449 --> 02:02:07,336
- 哇，你买了不少东西！    - 是啊
- Wow! You did some shopping.    - Yeah.

1245
02:02:07,786 --> 02:02:09,796
我买了些苏打水，可以去结账了么？
I got some soda. We done?

1246
02:02:11,206 --> 02:02:13,759
帮我们拿些麦片来，在收银台会合？
You want to go get us some cereal and I'll meet you at the checkout?

1247
02:02:14,752 --> 02:02:16,745
好吧，麦片
Okay, cereal.

1248
02:02:21,008 --> 02:02:21,998
在哪儿…？
Where?

1249
02:03:21,610 --> 02:03:25,372
有人把货车开到伊拉克一个集市中央
Some guy drove his truck to the middle of an Iraqi market,

1250
02:03:25,906 --> 02:03:27,945
开始发放免费糖果
starts passing out free candies.

1251
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:30,752
所有孩子都跑过去，还有孩子的家人
All the kids coming running up, the families stuff,

1252
02:03:32,663 --> 02:03:33,999
那人引爆了炸弹
He detonates.

1253
02:03:36,583 --> 02:03:38,160
据报道有59人死亡
They're saying 59 are dead.

1254
02:03:48,512 --> 02:03:50,522
他们需要补充拆弹员，这你知道
You know they need more bomb techs.

1255
02:03:54,393 --> 02:03:55,886
帮我把这些切碎
You want to chop those up for me?

1256
02:04:07,156 --> 02:04:08,148
对了
Yeah

1257
02:04:10,242 --> 02:04:12,152
你喜欢玩这个啊
You love playing with that.

1258
02:04:12,953 --> 02:04:15,364
你喜欢玩毛绒玩具
You love playing with all your stuffed animals.

1259
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:21,999
你喜欢妈妈，喜欢爸爸 喜欢你的小睡衣
You love your mommy, your daddy, your nature pajamas.

1260
02:04:22,087 --> 02:04:25,082
你什么都喜欢，是不是？
You love everything, don't you? Yeah

1261
02:04:26,508 --> 02:04:27,991
知道吗？
You know what, buddy?

1262
02:04:28,886 --> 02:04:30,379
等你长大了
Once you get older,

1263
02:04:31,096 --> 02:04:36,735
曾经喜欢的东西也许会变得不再特别
some of the things that you love might not seem so special anymore.

1264
02:04:37,269 --> 02:04:39,321
就像这个玩偶盒
Like your Jack In The Box,

1265
02:04:42,107 --> 02:04:47,204
你会发现那只是一片铁皮加一个人偶
Maybe you realize it's just a piece of tin and a stuffed animal

1266
02:04:49,156 --> 02:04:53,585
那些原本钟爱的东西会渐渐被你遗忘
and then you forget the few things you really love,

1267
02:04:56,622 --> 02:05:00,467
到了我这个年纪，钟爱的东西 也许只剩下一两件了
And by the time you get to my age maybe it's only one or two things,

1268
02:05:08,759 --> 02:05:10,936
对我来说只剩一件了
With me I think it's one,

1269
02:05:47,381 --> 02:05:49,975
- 欢迎来到D连    - 中士
- Welcome to Delta Company    - Sergeant

1270
02:06:17,358 --> 02:06:23,333
[ 距D连轮值结束日还有365天 ]

1271
02:06:34,833 --> 02:06:42,833
（字幕调整lwrest）
