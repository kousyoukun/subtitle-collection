1
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:19,029
Go, go!

2
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:52,979
Approaching.

3
00:02:01,029 --> 00:02:03,865
I think we have touchdown.

4
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:11,498
Little to the right

5
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:34,479
Hello mum

6
00:02:38,566 --> 00:02:39,818
Now, push it in

7
00:02:43,363 --> 00:02:44,280
I can't

8
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:45,865
What do you mean you can't?
Pretend it's your dick, man.

9
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:48,576
How about I pretend it's your dick?

10
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:50,120
You'll never get in if you did that.

11
00:02:50,954 --> 00:02:53,373
- Here, let me have a shot.
- Give me a second,

12
00:02:53,373 --> 00:02:55,750
- No, come on
- My dick, man - Go

13
00:03:01,631 --> 00:03:02,799
Fucker

14
00:03:06,052 --> 00:03:07,846
- Got that
- Yeah

15
00:03:10,265 --> 00:03:11,599
Here we go

16
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:19,899
- Oh, look at that
- Nice 155, huh? - Yeah

17
00:03:21,025 --> 00:03:24,112
It's going to
do some fucking damage.

18
00:03:24,153 --> 00:03:27,198
Hey, Eldridge, looks like
we're going to need a charge!

19
00:03:27,407 --> 00:03:28,491
I got that.

20
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:32,120
Figured four blocks that'll
give us about 20 pounds of bang total.

21
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:34,789
That blast is going to
roast straight out there.

22
00:03:35,748 --> 00:03:37,792
The shell will probably kick out there,
and most of the shrapnel

23
00:03:37,792 --> 00:03:40,169
is going to shoot straight up
in a beautiful umbrella pattern.

24
00:03:40,253 --> 00:03:41,004
Yep

25
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,632
We're gonna get some smaller pieces
and shell fragments this way,

26
00:03:44,716 --> 00:03:46,759
but we'll be okay
if we're behind the Humvee,

27
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,720
- Bring the bot back, we'll load it up.
- No problem.

28
00:03:51,723 --> 00:03:53,182
Bot is moving.

29
00:04:08,281 --> 00:04:09,741
Let me know what you got, Eldridge.

30
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:11,159
Good to go.

31
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:13,995
All right, wagon's set up.
Bot moves.

32
00:04:16,581 --> 00:04:18,541
Uh-oh, we got goats, guys!

33
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:20,501
Goats 12:00, Watch out,

34
00:04:20,918 --> 00:04:22,712
Load them little bastards up.

35
00:04:39,187 --> 00:04:40,855
- Oh, shit,
- Shit,

36
00:04:42,857 --> 00:04:44,025
Oh, fuck!

37
00:04:44,275 --> 00:04:46,319
Wagon's having a bad day, boys.

38
00:04:46,402 --> 00:04:48,362
- You build that?
- No, the U.S. Army did,

39
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:50,698
All right, looks like
I'm going down there

40
00:04:50,907 --> 00:04:52,867
You don't like waiting around
this beautiful neighborhood?

41
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:53,868
Oh, I love it.

42
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,213
So, if everything looks okay,
when I get down there

43
00:05:06,797 --> 00:05:08,632
I'm just going
to set it up and bip it,

44
00:05:08,716 --> 00:05:10,593
Give these people
something to think about,

45
00:05:11,344 --> 00:05:13,554
Want them to know if they're gonna leave
a bomb on the side of the road for us,

46
00:05:13,637 --> 00:05:15,348
we're just going to blow up
their little fuckin' road,

47
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:16,140
Sounds good

48
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:19,685
Craving a burger; is that strange?

49
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:21,520
- Not for you
- No, okay

50
00:05:21,812 --> 00:05:22,980
Helmet on

51
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:25,274
Happy trails

52
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,367
Blaster One, can you read me?

53
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:37,536
Roger that, Blaster one.
You're good to go.

54
00:05:43,667 --> 00:05:45,044
You're looking good, Blaster One.

55
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,565
Nice and hot in here.

56
00:06:13,781 --> 00:06:14,782
One fifty

57
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,034
Roger that, 150 meters

58
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:32,091
Hi!

59
00:06:32,424 --> 00:06:34,301
- Where are you from?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

60
00:06:34,343 --> 00:06:35,803
Where are you from?
Where are you from?

61
00:06:36,387 --> 00:06:37,221
California?

62
00:06:37,304 --> 00:06:38,639
- Hey, get out of here, man
- Where?

63
00:06:38,764 --> 00:06:41,058
Hey, this ain't no fuckin' meet
and greet. Now get out of here.

64
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:42,768
Now

65
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:46,980
Go!

66
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:57,783
You making friends again, Sanborn?

67
00:06:58,450 --> 00:06:59,451
All day long

68
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,960
Twenty-five

69
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:11,338
Twenty-five meters, Roger that
You are now in the kill zone.

70
00:07:13,257 --> 00:07:15,008
Thanks for reminding me.

71
00:07:15,342 --> 00:07:17,135
That's what I'm here for, baby.

72
00:07:18,554 --> 00:07:19,555
Okay-

73
00:07:28,188 --> 00:07:29,606
The debts look good.

74
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:31,525
Roger that.

75
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,515
I'm laying on the charge.

76
00:08:04,474 --> 00:08:05,892
Nice and sweet.

77
00:08:07,602 --> 00:08:09,104
We're good to go.

78
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:10,939
I'm coming back.

79
00:08:13,233 --> 00:08:16,403
- Five meters out.
- Five meters, Roger that.

80
00:08:16,736 --> 00:08:17,904
Hey, Sanborn

81
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:21,408
- You know what this place needs?
- I'm listening.

82
00:08:22,033 --> 00:08:23,118
Needs grass

83
00:08:25,036 --> 00:08:26,746
We gonna start our grass business?

84
00:08:26,788 --> 00:08:27,789
That's right, man.

85
00:08:28,415 --> 00:08:31,918
I'm going to sell the grass,
you're going to cut it.

86
00:08:33,128 --> 00:08:35,255
It's going to be called
''Sanborn and Sons'',

87
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:38,300
We'll be rich.

88
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:43,096
I like that, crabgrass,
St. Augustine, man.

89
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:44,806
I'm a scholar on this shit,

90
00:08:45,682 --> 00:08:49,686
How about this?
You sell it, I fertilize it.

91
00:08:51,021 --> 00:08:53,648
- 25
- 25 meters, Roger that

92
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:55,191
Sanborn!

93
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:58,236
Butcher shop, 2:00!
dude has a phone!

94
00:08:58,612 --> 00:08:59,613
Why is Eldridge running?

95
00:09:00,572 --> 00:09:02,699
- Make him put it down!
- Put down the phone!

96
00:09:03,116 --> 00:09:04,576
Come on, guys, talk to me,

97
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:07,412
Drop the phone!
Drop your phone!

98
00:09:07,537 --> 00:09:09,914
Hey, burn him, Eldridge! Burn him!

99
00:09:09,998 --> 00:09:12,459
- Put down the cell phone!
- Eldridge, burn him!

100
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,335
- Get out of the way,
- Drop your phone!

101
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:16,254
Make him put it down!
Go get it!

102
00:09:17,297 --> 00:09:19,591
- Come on, Eldridge!
- I can't get him shot!

103
00:09:36,065 --> 00:09:37,484
Thompson!

104
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:07,764
Anywhere's good,

105
00:10:29,494 --> 00:10:31,245
- Is that everything?
- Yeah,

106
00:11:07,573 --> 00:11:08,407
Yeah?

107
00:11:12,912 --> 00:11:13,913
Come in.

108
00:11:16,249 --> 00:11:17,500
Sergeant James?

109
00:11:21,587 --> 00:11:22,964
JT Sanborn, man.

110
00:11:23,005 --> 00:11:25,007
Hey! Hi, how are you? Will.

111
00:11:25,049 --> 00:11:27,093
Welcome to Bravo Company;
welcome to Camp Victory,

112
00:11:27,134 --> 00:11:29,762
Camp Victory?
I thought this was Camp Liberty,

113
00:11:29,804 --> 00:11:32,640
Oh! No, they changed
that about a week ago.

114
00:11:32,682 --> 00:11:33,849
Victory sounds better.

115
00:11:34,892 --> 00:11:37,561
- All right. Well, at least
I'm in the right place, right? - Yeah,

116
00:11:37,603 --> 00:11:39,605
While you're here, can you help me
move this thing real quick?

117
00:11:39,647 --> 00:11:40,648
Yeah, no problem.

118
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:42,775
Maybe you shouldn't take this down.

119
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:44,443
We get a lot of mortars at night.

120
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:47,738
The plywood on the windows help
with the lateral fray coming through.

121
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,864
That's why it's up there.

122
00:11:48,948 --> 00:11:51,492
Yeah, well, it's not going
to stop a mortar round

123
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:52,993
from coming in through
the roof, you know.

124
00:11:53,536 --> 00:11:56,330
Besides, I like the sunshine.

125
00:11:57,623 --> 00:11:59,917
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson.

126
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,294
- I know he was a good tech.
- Yeah, he was,

127
00:12:03,254 --> 00:12:04,797
He was a great team leader, too,

128
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:07,758
Yeah, I'm not trying
to fill his shoes or anything,

129
00:12:07,800 --> 00:12:09,427
I'm just...
I'm just going to do my best.

130
00:12:10,177 --> 00:12:12,555
- Appreciate it,
- All right.

131
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:14,098
Cool

132
00:12:17,518 --> 00:12:19,019
Home sweet home, right?

133
00:12:26,485 --> 00:12:29,029
Aren't you glad the Army has
all these tanks parked here?

134
00:12:29,405 --> 00:12:32,116
Just in case the Russians come
we have to have a big tank battle.

135
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:36,161
I'd rather be on the side with the tanks,
just in case, rather than not have them.

136
00:12:36,245 --> 00:12:37,580
Yeah, but they don't do anything.

137
00:12:37,997 --> 00:12:40,666
Anyone comes alongside
a Humvee we're dead.

138
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,043
Anybody even looks
at you funny we're dead,

139
00:12:43,502 --> 00:12:46,255
Pretty much the bottom line is
if you're in Iraq, you're dead.

140
00:12:46,297 --> 00:12:48,007
How's a fuckin' tank
supposed to stop that?

141
00:12:48,090 --> 00:12:50,551
- Would you shut up, Owen please?
- Sorry

142
00:12:51,468 --> 00:12:52,845
Just trying to scare the new guy.

143
00:12:53,512 --> 00:12:55,723
I saw a little bit in Afghanistan, too.

144
00:13:04,857 --> 00:13:07,401
- Get your eyes on the road, Eldridge.
- Copy that

145
00:13:13,741 --> 00:13:14,742
Yalla!

146
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,160
Move!

147
00:13:53,363 --> 00:13:55,407
Blaster One, this is Victory Main.

148
00:13:55,449 --> 00:13:57,659
Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over.

149
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:09,338
Where the hell are the guys
who called this in?

150
00:14:26,021 --> 00:14:28,482
Victory Main, Victory Main,
this is Blaster Mike.

151
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:31,610
Interrogative, do you have
an update on position? Over.

152
00:14:34,029 --> 00:14:40,452
Victory Main, figures to follow,
Three-four-five-three is your grid.

153
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,045
Well, that's exactly where the hell I am
and I don't see anybody in fatigues,

154
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:52,214
Give us a second to confirm.

155
00:14:53,465 --> 00:14:54,466
Watch your feet!

156
00:14:54,549 --> 00:14:58,053
Set visual
is three-four five-three,

157
00:14:58,762 --> 00:15:00,013
Got the Humvee

158
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,601
Friendly!

159
00:15:07,729 --> 00:15:08,647
Friendly!

160
00:15:26,081 --> 00:15:27,332
Ah, here we go.

161
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:30,669
They abandoned their vehicle.

162
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,004
We got an empty Humvee
over here, James.

163
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:35,256
Yeah, I got it.

164
00:15:38,385 --> 00:15:39,302
Let's move.

165
00:15:41,846 --> 00:15:42,931
Friendly,

166
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:49,688
- Morning, boys.
- Sir.

167
00:15:50,355 --> 00:15:52,065
Don't tell me the bomb's
in here with you guys.

168
00:15:53,024 --> 00:15:55,151
- Step out and I'll show you
what's going on - All right

169
00:15:55,568 --> 00:15:57,529
Down on that block 20 meters.

170
00:15:57,654 --> 00:15:59,614
This side of the mosque.
east side of the street.

171
00:15:59,739 --> 00:16:01,616
our informant says he saw
a pair of wires

172
00:16:01,741 --> 00:16:03,201
going into a rubble pile

173
00:16:03,326 --> 00:16:05,036
- It's a possible IED.
- Yeah

174
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:07,205
- I trust this guy. I know him.
- Okay,

175
00:16:07,205 --> 00:16:09,124
- I'll handle it,
- Do you want to talk him or... - No,

176
00:16:09,165 --> 00:16:11,459
Good, Keep your boys back,
We'll be good, Thank you,

177
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:14,212
Specialist, bring up the Humvee,

178
00:16:14,295 --> 00:16:15,046
What's going on?

179
00:16:15,130 --> 00:16:16,297
I'm going to break out the suit.

180
00:16:17,841 --> 00:16:19,884
- What about the bot?
- I'll take care of it.

181
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:22,262
Don't you want to send the bot down
there to see what it looks like?

182
00:16:22,262 --> 00:16:23,263
I'll handle it.

183
00:16:23,346 --> 00:16:25,390
That's kind of tight down here, James.

184
00:16:41,114 --> 00:16:42,031
Ready?

185
00:16:45,952 --> 00:16:46,869
Good?

186
00:16:57,255 --> 00:17:00,216
You don't have to go down there,
We already have the bot halfway up.

187
00:17:00,258 --> 00:17:01,259
I'll be all right.

188
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:15,648
First day, figure you want
to take it easy, right?

189
00:17:22,321 --> 00:17:23,239
How's it looking, Eldridge?

190
00:17:23,322 --> 00:17:24,741
- Good to go
- Let's do it

191
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,170
- Got tools?
- Got tools

192
00:17:37,211 --> 00:17:38,880
All right. Let's rock and roll, man.

193
00:17:57,857 --> 00:18:00,234
- He's a rowdy boy
- He's reckless

194
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:14,749
Blaster One, what's going on?

195
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,960
Blaster One! What are you doing?

196
00:18:19,795 --> 00:18:21,505
Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike

197
00:18:21,547 --> 00:18:23,257
What's with the smoke
on the side of the road?

198
00:18:26,135 --> 00:18:27,928
Hey, James, can you hear me?

199
00:18:28,012 --> 00:18:31,265
What's going on with the smoke
on the side of the road? Over

200
00:18:32,808 --> 00:18:34,060
Creating a diversion

201
00:18:34,143 --> 00:18:35,394
From what? Is there a threat?

202
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,938
Eldridge, get up on the wall, Move!

203
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:42,068
Tell me what you see, specialist

204
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:45,196
All right, I got him

205
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:46,864
He's walking down range.

206
00:18:46,906 --> 00:18:49,533
James, the smoke
is killing my visibility.

207
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:53,162
Where are you in relationship to the IED?
Are you within 100 meters yet?

208
00:18:53,829 --> 00:18:57,333
Hell, I don't know, but I'll tell you
when I'm standing over it, cowboy.

209
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:35,704
Take cover!

210
00:19:41,835 --> 00:19:44,380
Oh, no, A car stopped
in front of him, Sanborn.

211
00:19:44,672 --> 00:19:47,424
Shit, James! James, come back now.

212
00:19:47,466 --> 00:19:49,510
EOD pulled a nine
on this Haji in a car.

213
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:53,597
Want me to send backup?

214
00:19:54,306 --> 00:19:55,474
I got it.

215
00:19:55,682 --> 00:19:57,893
- Sanchez, Hayes!
- Negative! Negative!

216
00:19:58,227 --> 00:19:59,311
Stand down

217
00:19:59,395 --> 00:20:01,271
The blast will come up the block

218
00:20:01,563 --> 00:20:03,273
Stay clear around the corner

219
00:20:03,315 --> 00:20:06,151
EOD has the situation
under control, over

220
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:09,738
- Where you going?
- Hold your fire on my command!

221
00:20:10,781 --> 00:20:12,032
Want to back up?

222
00:20:17,496 --> 00:20:18,497
Get out of the car!

223
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:21,750
- Get out of the car!
- Come on!

224
00:20:25,796 --> 00:20:27,339
What the fuck are you doing?

225
00:20:30,801 --> 00:20:31,718
Back up!

226
00:20:35,931 --> 00:20:37,266
Hello?

227
00:20:52,364 --> 00:20:53,365
Want to get back?

228
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:16,304
It's that way.

229
00:21:21,393 --> 00:21:22,394
Back

230
00:21:42,747 --> 00:21:43,665
Taxi's moving.

231
00:21:43,707 --> 00:21:46,459
Get out of the car!
Stop!

232
00:21:53,091 --> 00:21:55,468
Stay down!

233
00:21:58,430 --> 00:22:00,807
Well, if he wasn't an insurgent,
he sure the hell is now.

234
00:22:02,225 --> 00:22:03,852
Roger that! That's real funny.

235
00:22:58,990 --> 00:22:59,908
Got something

236
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:12,837
Oh, baby!

237
00:23:44,869 --> 00:23:45,953
Gotcha

238
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:01,594
All right

239
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,476
We're done

240
00:24:10,186 --> 00:24:13,439
Good to go

241
00:24:13,481 --> 00:24:14,941
Come down, specialist.

242
00:24:16,484 --> 00:24:17,318
Roger

243
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:33,125
Got a wire

244
00:24:34,669 --> 00:24:35,753
Hang on

245
00:24:41,467 --> 00:24:43,302
Where are you going?

246
00:24:58,109 --> 00:24:59,276
Secondary

247
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:00,361
Shit

248
00:25:00,403 --> 00:25:02,071
Take cover! Get in the wall!
Get in the wall!

249
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:49,887
That wasn't so bad. First time working
together. What do you think?

250
00:26:51,722 --> 00:26:57,519
I think us working together means
I talk to you and you talk to me

251
00:26:58,312 --> 00:27:00,606
- We going on a date, Sanborn?
- No

252
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:02,357
We're going on a mission.

253
00:27:02,691 --> 00:27:05,652
and my job is to keep you safe
so we can keep going on missions.

254
00:27:05,944 --> 00:27:07,279
It's combat, buddy.

255
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:15,954
Hey,

256
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:17,873
It's just 39 days.

257
00:27:17,915 --> 00:27:19,458
Thirty-eight if we survive today.

258
00:27:37,934 --> 00:27:39,561
Hey, it's ''Mr., Be All You Can Be''!

259
00:27:40,645 --> 00:27:41,563
What's up, doc?

260
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,148
Not much, How are you?

261
00:27:44,191 --> 00:27:44,941
I'm good.

262
00:27:47,152 --> 00:27:50,405
Got a question about that
song, ''Be All You Can Be''.

263
00:27:51,364 --> 00:27:54,326
What if all I can be is dead
on the side of an Iraqi road?

264
00:27:54,701 --> 00:27:56,078
I mean, I think it's logical.

265
00:27:56,119 --> 00:28:01,333
This is war, people die
all the time. Why not me?

266
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:03,794
You got to change
the record in our head.

267
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,587
You gotta start thinking
about other things.

268
00:28:05,837 --> 00:28:07,339
Okay,
Stop obsessing... Right now.

269
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:09,716
What are you thinking about?

270
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:11,843
You want to know what I'm thinking
about, doc?  - Yeah

271
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:14,095
This is what I'm thinking about, doc.

272
00:28:16,014 --> 00:28:20,227
Here's Thompson, okay.
He's dead, he's alive.

273
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:24,064
Here's Thompson.
He's dead, he's alive.

274
00:28:25,398 --> 00:28:26,942
He's dead. He's alive.

275
00:28:33,198 --> 00:28:35,492
Yo, what's up, my nigger?
What's up, man? You cool?

276
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:38,578
Come on, You want the cool shit?
Come on, come on, It's the tight shit, man,

277
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:41,081
Wanna buy DVD?
Wanna buy DVD?

278
00:28:41,122 --> 00:28:43,083
Fuck you,
Come, come, please, please1

279
00:28:43,625 --> 00:28:44,876
New releases, look.

280
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,420
Hello, Hello!
Want to buy DVDs? Very good, Very good,

281
00:28:47,879 --> 00:28:48,546
How much?

282
00:28:48,588 --> 00:28:50,048
One for five and two for nine,

283
00:28:50,090 --> 00:28:51,174
Three for twelve.

284
00:28:51,508 --> 00:28:54,177
Three for thirteen and I don't
give you tax. Very good, man. Look.

285
00:28:54,219 --> 00:28:56,096
- Look...
- No tax?

286
00:28:56,137 --> 00:28:57,972
All right, What do you got?
What do you got,

287
00:28:58,098 --> 00:29:01,518
You know, you smart shit,
You not like those stupid fuck face.

288
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:03,186
Yeah, I'm the smart guy.

289
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:06,898
You're a smart kid,
Give me your best one, okay?

290
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:09,484
- Here, this the best one.
- This is a good one?

291
00:29:09,526 --> 00:29:11,569
- Yeah, The best shit, man.
- Okay

292
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:13,279
Here you go,
I'll take one.

293
00:29:13,405 --> 00:29:15,281
- Keep the change
- Thank you

294
00:29:15,281 --> 00:29:16,199
Want a cigarette?

295
00:29:16,866 --> 00:29:18,618
Get out of here,
You shouldn't smoke.

296
00:29:20,703 --> 00:29:22,122
Thank you. Take it easy.

297
00:29:28,419 --> 00:29:31,256
I need to talk to you about
something before we go out again.

298
00:29:32,298 --> 00:29:33,216
What's that?

299
00:29:35,218 --> 00:29:37,095
- Yesterday
- Mm-hmm

300
00:29:38,471 --> 00:29:39,472
Wasn't cool

301
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:44,269
Yeah, I know.
You'll get it, though.

302
00:29:47,188 --> 00:29:49,732
- So, you're a ranger, huh?
- Yeah,

303
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,611
I was in intelligence seven years
before I joined EOD,

304
00:29:55,196 --> 00:29:58,783
We ran missions in every shithole
that you could possibly imagine.

305
00:30:01,577 --> 00:30:05,248
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a
redneck piece of trailer trash like you.

306
00:30:07,458 --> 00:30:09,085
Looks like you're on the right track.

307
00:30:11,254 --> 00:30:12,338
We'll see you out there.

308
00:30:23,933 --> 00:30:24,934
Let's go, move!

309
00:30:31,524 --> 00:30:34,318
Shit, Get out of the way. Move!

310
00:30:38,573 --> 00:30:39,657
Hello

311
00:30:40,783 --> 00:30:43,161
- Where is it?
- It's behind the wall

312
00:30:43,286 --> 00:30:45,663
- All right,
- See any wires? Any smoke?

313
00:30:45,746 --> 00:30:46,831
No, I didn't look

314
00:30:46,914 --> 00:30:47,999
So, how do you know it's a bomb?

315
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,334
The car has been parked illegally

316
00:30:50,418 --> 00:30:53,546
The suspension is sagging. There's
definitely something heavy in the trunk,

317
00:30:53,588 --> 00:30:56,924
Right. So, why don't you walk over there
and peak inside and tell me what you see.

318
00:30:58,217 --> 00:31:00,011
You want me to go close to it?

319
00:31:00,803 --> 00:31:03,264
Yeah! No-no, I don't. I'm kidding.

320
00:31:56,025 --> 00:31:56,859
Shit

321
00:31:57,193 --> 00:31:58,652
It's coming from over here!

322
00:32:05,409 --> 00:32:06,410
Blaster One. You there?

323
00:32:12,625 --> 00:32:13,876
Blaster One, you hear me?

324
00:32:15,544 --> 00:32:16,795
Here

325
00:32:24,261 --> 00:32:24,929
Shit

326
00:32:27,765 --> 00:32:29,183
Let's go, guys.

327
00:32:31,393 --> 00:32:32,394
Let it go.

328
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:34,521
I got top cover.

329
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:35,689
That's a negative, specialist.

330
00:32:35,773 --> 00:32:37,107
Eldridge, you stay with me.

331
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:38,692
Sanborn, you take top covers.

332
00:32:38,734 --> 00:32:39,568
Shit

333
00:33:19,775 --> 00:33:21,026
Blaster Mike in position

334
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:47,469
What do you got?

335
00:33:47,844 --> 00:33:50,305
I got a through and through to
the chest, but I got him stable.

336
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:52,349
He's not going to make it.

337
00:33:52,891 --> 00:33:54,685
We're leaving in 15 minutes.

338
00:33:54,726 --> 00:33:56,144
Got a survival wound, sir.

339
00:33:57,688 --> 00:33:58,855
He's not going to make it.

340
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:28,552
Oh, God.

341
00:34:39,855 --> 00:34:41,648
- What's he doing?
- I don't know,

342
00:34:46,153 --> 00:34:47,237
What are you doing?

343
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,406
There's enough bang in there
to send us all to Jesus.

344
00:34:49,865 --> 00:34:53,285
If I'm going to die,
I'm going to die comfortable.

345
00:34:53,702 --> 00:34:55,370
I need my kit and my cans.

346
00:34:55,745 --> 00:34:57,247
What's going on down there, Eldridge?

347
00:34:57,706 --> 00:35:00,584
I'm getting his kit and his cans.
Cover me, please.

348
00:35:11,011 --> 00:35:12,387
Kit and cans

349
00:35:29,362 --> 00:35:32,949
Got a Lot of deck cord, electrical

350
00:35:52,093 --> 00:35:53,803
I'm looking for this initiating system

351
00:36:21,706 --> 00:36:23,291
Well, it's not in the back seat.

352
00:36:25,877 --> 00:36:27,212
I don't think.

353
00:36:41,225 --> 00:36:42,852
All right, It's not in the back seat.

354
00:36:51,944 --> 00:36:55,114
Got a young man on the roof,
your 9:00, keep an eye on him.

355
00:36:55,323 --> 00:36:56,240
Roger that

356
00:37:04,457 --> 00:37:05,625
It's not in the front seat.

357
00:37:12,048 --> 00:37:13,424
It's not in the door.

358
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:21,057
Not on the floors.

359
00:37:25,686 --> 00:37:26,854
Not in the glove box.

360
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:29,649
If you haven't found it yet,
it's probably under the car.

361
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:33,444
Yeah, no wire leads under... the car.
It's all in here somewhere.

362
00:37:40,535 --> 00:37:42,411
- Hey, Sanborn
- Yeah

363
00:37:42,453 --> 00:37:45,414
You got eyes on some guy,
with a video camera?

364
00:37:45,498 --> 00:37:46,499
No, Where?

365
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:50,461
He's right at my 12:00, you see him?
He's pointing the fucking thing at me

366
00:38:01,305 --> 00:38:02,098
Shit

367
00:38:02,098 --> 00:38:03,349
Negative, I don't see him.

368
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:07,269
Hey, Sanborn. He's right
at my 12:00, look! 12:00!

369
00:38:08,521 --> 00:38:09,689
Roger that, I got him.

370
00:38:14,318 --> 00:38:16,195
Getting ready to put me on YouTube.

371
00:38:17,488 --> 00:38:20,032
- Little shady,- Yeah, he Looks shady.
Keep an eye on him,

372
00:38:20,324 --> 00:38:21,909
Okay, So, what's the play?

373
00:38:23,536 --> 00:38:25,663
Be smart. Make a good decision, over

374
00:38:32,878 --> 00:38:34,130
Got more wire

375
00:38:39,343 --> 00:38:41,387
Leads fucking nowhere

376
00:38:43,264 --> 00:38:44,265
Fuck!

377
00:38:45,558 --> 00:38:46,809
Hey, James, how you doing?

378
00:38:48,811 --> 00:38:50,187
I'm wonderful, How are you?

379
00:38:50,396 --> 00:38:51,897
You know, we've been here a while

380
00:38:53,774 --> 00:38:55,109
We need to get out of here soon.

381
00:38:55,276 --> 00:38:56,193
Uh-huh,

382
00:39:01,156 --> 00:39:03,993
We got a lot of eyes on us, James.
We need to get out of here.

383
00:39:05,536 --> 00:39:08,664
Roger that, I might figure this out.

384
00:39:10,165 --> 00:39:11,709
James, we need to get out of here,

385
00:39:13,294 --> 00:39:14,878
James, do you copy?

386
00:39:15,671 --> 00:39:17,256
Fuck it, I get it.

387
00:39:19,341 --> 00:39:21,885
Fuck me

388
00:39:29,101 --> 00:39:32,021
- Hey, how's it looking in there,
soldier? - All clear

389
00:39:33,063 --> 00:39:35,024
James, the evac
is complete. We can leave.

390
00:39:35,107 --> 00:39:36,525
Let the engineers handle this mess,

391
00:39:36,608 --> 00:39:38,694
- We moving?
- That's affirmative

392
00:39:53,041 --> 00:39:54,042
Interesting

393
00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:56,211
What's up with James?
He's not answering

394
00:39:57,421 --> 00:39:59,465
Yeah, I think he removed his headset,

395
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:03,552
Well, will you tell him to
put his radio back on, please?

396
00:40:04,011 --> 00:40:05,262
Hey, James!

397
00:40:05,304 --> 00:40:09,433
Sergeant Sanborn is asking if
you'll please put your headset back on.

398
00:40:16,273 --> 00:40:17,941
Uh... that's a negative.

399
00:40:18,483 --> 00:40:20,110
That, yeah, that's not gonna happen.

400
00:40:36,460 --> 00:40:39,296
I got eyes on three guys
at the Minaret at 6:00.

401
00:40:58,065 --> 00:41:01,360
- What the hell is he doing?
- I don't know what the fuck he's doing,

402
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:03,111
Looks like, he's checking the oil.

403
00:41:41,024 --> 00:41:42,859
They're communicating
with your cameraman.

404
00:41:43,401 --> 00:41:44,653
This is real bad, man.

405
00:41:44,694 --> 00:41:46,112
Get behind the Jersey barrier.

406
00:41:51,409 --> 00:41:53,036
I can't see James from here.

407
00:41:53,286 --> 00:41:54,371
Get down now!

408
00:41:59,834 --> 00:42:01,211
We can go!

409
00:42:08,051 --> 00:42:08,968
Bastard

410
00:42:33,118 --> 00:42:34,285
We're done.

411
00:42:36,454 --> 00:42:39,582
Sanborn, let's get out of here.

412
00:42:54,556 --> 00:42:55,640
Woo

413
00:43:08,444 --> 00:43:09,362
That was good.

414
00:43:20,081 --> 00:43:21,624
- Hey, James!
- What?

415
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,087
Never turn your headset off again.

416
00:43:52,113 --> 00:43:53,489
You the guy in the bomb suit?

417
00:43:54,115 --> 00:43:56,784
No, sir, Sir, that's Sergeant James.
He's right here.

418
00:43:57,285 --> 00:43:58,786
- Hey, James.
- Yeah?

419
00:43:59,287 --> 00:44:00,455
Someone's here to see you.

420
00:44:02,206 --> 00:44:04,584
You the guy in the flaming car.
Sergeant James?

421
00:44:04,625 --> 00:44:06,335
Afternoon, sir
Uh, yes, sir

422
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:10,131
Well, that's just hot shit.

423
00:44:10,506 --> 00:44:12,383
You're a wild man, you know that?

424
00:44:13,217 --> 00:44:14,886
- Uh, yes, sir
- He's a wild man

425
00:44:15,094 --> 00:44:16,095
You know that?

426
00:44:17,054 --> 00:44:18,222
I want to shake your hand.

427
00:44:19,015 --> 00:44:20,099
- Thank you, sir.
- Yeah

428
00:44:20,349 --> 00:44:22,810
How many bombs have you disarmed?

429
00:44:23,769 --> 00:44:24,937
Uh, I'm not quite sure.

430
00:44:24,979 --> 00:44:26,147
- Sergeant?
- Yes, sir.

431
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:27,440
I asked you a question.

432
00:44:29,650 --> 00:44:30,651
Eight hundred seventy-three, sir.

433
00:44:30,735 --> 00:44:34,655
Eight hundred! And seventy-three.

434
00:44:35,948 --> 00:44:37,283
That's just hot shit.

435
00:44:37,533 --> 00:44:39,201
Eight-hundred and seventy-three.

436
00:44:39,952 --> 00:44:41,912
Counting today, sir, yes.
- That's gotta be a record.

437
00:44:44,373 --> 00:44:48,836
What's the best way to... go about
disarming one of these things?

438
00:44:50,296 --> 00:44:51,756
The way you don't die, sir.

439
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:54,675
That's a good one.

440
00:44:54,884 --> 00:44:57,678
That's spoken like a wild man.
That's good.

441
00:45:14,487 --> 00:45:17,072
- Hey, what's up, man?
- Oh, hey, wait a minute,

442
00:45:17,072 --> 00:45:18,407
Look who it is.

443
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,410
I want my five bucks back, buddy.

444
00:45:21,535 --> 00:45:23,746
Five dollars for what, man?
You crazy now?

445
00:45:23,787 --> 00:45:25,748
Yeah, The DVD you sold me was crap.

446
00:45:25,789 --> 00:45:28,918
You crazy, man. That's impossible.
It's Hollywood special effects.

447
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:30,544
No, It was shaky.
It was out of focus, buddy.

448
00:45:30,586 --> 00:45:32,046
- What, you want donkey porn?
- It's crap.

449
00:45:32,046 --> 00:45:34,256
- Girls on dog?

450
00:45:34,298 --> 00:45:35,674
Anything you want, you get.

451
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:37,927
I hook you up, man.

452
00:45:38,093 --> 00:45:39,887
All right, What... what's your name?

453
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:41,972
- Beckham.

454
00:45:42,056 --> 00:45:44,141
Yeah, man. It's like soccer player.
Now give me my ball.

455
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:45,309

Yeah, man, Best of the best.

461
00:46:01,408 --> 00:46:02,493

478
00:46:48,247 --> 00:46:50,290
I'm going to buy another DVD, okay?

479
00:46:51,083 --> 00:46:55,170
But if it's shaky... Look at me...
or out of focus...

480
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:57,798
or any way not 100%,

481
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:01,134
I'm going to chop off your god dammed
head with a dull knife.

482
00:47:01,385 --> 00:47:03,512
How do you feel about that?
I'm just kidding.

483
00:47:05,472 --> 00:47:08,100
Here, you're a good kid, man.
You're a good kid, aren't ya?

484
00:47:09,601 --> 00:47:10,602
Owen

485
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:12,896
Hi

486
00:47:12,938 --> 00:47:14,106
- Hi, sir,
- How are you?

487
00:47:15,065 --> 00:47:16,316
- I'm good
- Good

488
00:47:16,650 --> 00:47:19,111
- What's wrong?
- Brakes are squeaking

489
00:47:19,778 --> 00:47:21,905
Don't trust the mechanics
around here. You know.

490
00:47:23,031 --> 00:47:25,242
- So, how you doing?
- Good

491
00:47:25,784 --> 00:47:27,035
I just want to check the oil.

492
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:30,455
Yeah, it's good to sleep, eating well...

493
00:47:31,331 --> 00:47:33,458
I'm feeling pretty squared
away, actually, doc.

494
00:47:33,667 --> 00:47:34,918
Good to hear it.

495
00:47:35,544 --> 00:47:38,171
So, you getting along with the other
soldiers in your unit?

496
00:47:39,673 --> 00:47:45,053
Yeah, My team's great.
My team Leader is inspiring.

497
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:48,723
- Are you being sarcastic, soldier?
- No

498
00:47:49,057 --> 00:47:50,475
He's going to get me killed.

499
00:47:51,017 --> 00:47:52,561
almost died yesterday.

500
00:47:53,437 --> 00:47:57,482
At least I'll die in the line
of duty, proud and strong.

501
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:00,068
You know, this doesn't have
to be a bad time in your life.

502
00:48:00,652 --> 00:48:03,738
Going to war is a - is a once
in a lifetime experience.

503
00:48:04,072 --> 00:48:05,240
It could be fun.

504
00:48:05,532 --> 00:48:08,368
And you know this from your
extensive work in the field, right?

505
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,828
I've done my field duty.

506
00:48:10,412 --> 00:48:11,997
Where's that? Yale?

507
00:48:13,957 --> 00:48:16,877
Look, you don't want me to come around,
I won't come around.

508
00:48:16,918 --> 00:48:18,169
These talks are voluntary.

509
00:48:18,837 --> 00:48:20,005
Look, I'm sorry.

510
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,174
I appreciate
what you're saying, I do.

511
00:48:23,383 --> 00:48:25,093
I appreciate our sessions together,

512
00:48:26,469 --> 00:48:29,889
but you need to come out from
behind the wire, see what we do.

513
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:31,433
Well,

514
00:48:32,183 --> 00:48:34,060
if this circumstance calls
for it, I will.

515
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:35,854
Just like every other soldier.

516
00:48:42,402 --> 00:48:43,778
Fire in the hole!

517
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,155
Firing now!

518
00:48:49,492 --> 00:48:51,786
Eee, ooh...

519
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:53,955
- Ready for second det?
- Ready

520
00:48:54,664 --> 00:48:58,001
Fire in the hole!
Fire in the hole, Fire in the hole!

521
00:48:58,084 --> 00:48:59,586
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Hold on a second!

522
00:49:00,503 --> 00:49:03,590
God damn it,
I think it forgot my gloves down there.

523
00:49:03,798 --> 00:49:05,592
- What?
- I forgot my gloves.

524
00:49:06,009 --> 00:49:06,926
Hang on

525
00:49:41,419 --> 00:49:43,880
You know, these detonators
misfire all the time.

526
00:49:45,465 --> 00:49:46,466
What are you doing?

527
00:49:47,592 --> 00:49:49,886
I'm just saying shit happens,
they misfire.

528
00:49:53,097 --> 00:49:54,974
He'd be obliterated to nothing,

529
00:49:56,851 --> 00:49:58,728
His helmet would be left,
You could have that.

530
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:01,814
Little specs of hair,
charred on the inside.

531
00:50:03,149 --> 00:50:05,026
Yeah, there'd be half
a helmet somewhere,

532
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:07,153
bits of hair.

533
00:50:09,155 --> 00:50:11,824
Ask for a change
in technique and protocol,

534
00:50:11,866 --> 00:50:14,327
make sure this type of accident
never happen again, you know?

535
00:50:17,789 --> 00:50:19,207
You'd have to write the report.

536
00:50:21,959 --> 00:50:24,253
- Are you serious?
- I can't write it.

537
00:50:25,797 --> 00:50:28,091
No, I mean, are you serious
about killing him?

538
00:51:08,089 --> 00:51:11,300
- Twelve o'clock I see an SUV
- Roger that

539
00:51:11,676 --> 00:51:13,302
I got four armed men.

540
00:51:13,719 --> 00:51:15,304
They're in Haji gear.

541
00:51:17,014 --> 00:51:18,641
All right, go slow and easy.

542
00:51:26,649 --> 00:51:28,484
Careful now.

543
00:51:31,570 --> 00:51:33,531
All right, Careful now, guys.

544
00:51:34,073 --> 00:51:36,200
- Eldridge, you stay on that 50.
- I got 'em.

545
00:51:36,492 --> 00:51:39,829
''Obre... obre...''
put your gun down!

546
00:51:39,912 --> 00:51:43,666
On your knees!
Put your gun down!

547
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:46,919
- Obre, motherfucker!
- Hold up your hands!

548
00:51:46,961 --> 00:51:49,004
Get down, motherfucker, Obre!

549
00:51:49,588 --> 00:51:51,715
Put your gun down now!

550
00:51:57,513 --> 00:51:59,265
Put your gun down!

551
00:52:03,435 --> 00:52:05,020
Advance, advance...

552
00:52:25,249 --> 00:52:26,584
Hands high!

553
00:52:27,501 --> 00:52:29,545
- Eldridge, cover!
- I got you

554
00:52:31,005 --> 00:52:32,840
Pistol, off your hip, now!

555
00:52:33,465 --> 00:52:34,216
What you want me to do?

556
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,051
Keep my hands up or
take off the pistol?

557
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:40,264
- Keep your hands up
- Okay

558
00:52:45,686 --> 00:52:47,271
Easy, easy.

559
00:52:47,855 --> 00:52:48,856
Got it!

560
00:52:51,150 --> 00:52:52,735
Can I touch my fucking head now?

561
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:55,404
Slowly

562
00:53:03,036 --> 00:53:05,330
We're on the same fucking side, guys.

563
00:53:06,749 --> 00:53:07,666
Jesus

564
00:53:08,792 --> 00:53:10,544
You guys are wired fucking tight,
you know that?

565
00:53:10,586 --> 00:53:13,672
Well, this is no place for a picnic, right.
What are you guys doing here?

566
00:53:13,714 --> 00:53:15,507
We have a flat tire,
Can you help us?

567
00:53:15,549 --> 00:53:17,176
Sure, yeah. You got any spares?

568
00:53:17,217 --> 00:53:19,094
We have spares, but
we've used up our wrench.

569
00:53:19,386 --> 00:53:20,637
How do you use up a wrench?

570
00:53:20,804 --> 00:53:23,473
Well, the uh, the guy over there
with the red thing on his head,

571
00:53:23,473 --> 00:53:24,558
he threw it at someone.

572
00:53:25,893 --> 00:53:27,144
- All right
- Thank you

573
00:53:31,398 --> 00:53:34,193
That's Chris, this is the wrench man.

574
00:53:34,526 --> 00:53:36,653
Hello, wrench man, that's Jimmy.

575
00:53:36,737 --> 00:53:39,114
You know, you can shoot people here,
you don't have to throw a wrench at 'em,

576
00:53:39,197 --> 00:53:40,115
Fuck off

577
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,168
Take a look at this,

578
00:53:52,002 --> 00:53:53,795
I picked these guys up in Najaf.

579
00:53:56,006 --> 00:53:57,466
Nine of hearts, that's one,

580
00:53:58,634 --> 00:54:01,178
And the other...
jack of clubs,

581
00:54:06,183 --> 00:54:08,018
- These the same guys?
- Yep, That's them.

582
00:54:11,730 --> 00:54:12,814
Does he need a little help there?

583
00:54:13,523 --> 00:54:15,275
What's the problem
with the tire? Come on.

584
00:54:17,778 --> 00:54:20,072
No good, boss.
This wrench is too small.

585
00:54:20,447 --> 00:54:21,782
All right, solutions? Anyone?

586
00:54:21,907 --> 00:54:24,451
I think there's another wrench in the
back of the Humvee if you want to check,

587
00:54:24,493 --> 00:54:25,911
- I'll give it a try.
- All right. Let's do it.

588
00:54:27,579 --> 00:54:28,830
How long you guys out here?

589
00:54:29,623 --> 00:54:31,500
Well, I don't know.
Specialist, what do we got?

590
00:54:32,667 --> 00:54:38,048
- We have... 23 more days or 22...
- Oh yeah

591
00:54:38,590 --> 00:54:41,927
No one's counting.

592
00:54:45,305 --> 00:54:47,057
Contact left!

593
00:54:57,484 --> 00:54:58,944
Take cover!

594
00:54:59,152 --> 00:55:02,113
Chris, take the 50. Jimmy,
take that in the Humvee.

595
00:55:02,155 --> 00:55:03,615
- Got it.
- Come on!

596
00:55:17,811 --> 00:55:18,729
Charlie, go!

597
00:55:20,063 --> 00:55:21,523
Go, go, go!

598
00:55:28,864 --> 00:55:29,948
Fucking morons!

599
00:55:30,032 --> 00:55:33,785
Get on the side, Charlie
Get the Barret and the go-bag, Jimmy.

600
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,707
- What are we shooting at?
- I don't know.

601
00:55:39,166 --> 00:55:40,792
Fuck, the packages are gone!

602
00:55:40,792 --> 00:55:41,960
They won't get far on foot.

603
00:55:42,085 --> 00:55:45,255
Bring 'em back those fuckers now.
I'm out 500,000 fucking pounds.

604
00:55:58,477 --> 00:55:59,478
I forgot,

605
00:55:59,603 --> 00:56:01,897
it's 500,000 dead or alive.

606
00:56:05,567 --> 00:56:08,236
- Okay Jimmy, give me the Barret.
- Yeah

607
00:56:10,447 --> 00:56:11,531
I can't see a thing.

608
00:56:13,825 --> 00:56:14,576
Come on!

609
00:56:20,207 --> 00:56:22,834
Chris is shooting wild.
Gotta conserve the ammo.

610
00:56:22,876 --> 00:56:24,127
Hey, Chris can you hear me?

611
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:28,840
Hey, Chris! Chris! Can you hear me?
Chill out on the 50!

612
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:30,008
Roger that.

613
00:56:32,469 --> 00:56:34,679
- Fifty's down
- They shot Chris.

614
00:56:46,024 --> 00:56:47,651
It must be coming from that building.

615
00:56:47,692 --> 00:56:48,860
I can't see anything.

616
00:56:53,823 --> 00:56:55,075
Movement on the roof.

617
00:57:09,172 --> 00:57:10,006
Yeah?

618
00:57:10,507 --> 00:57:11,675
Three meters higher.

619
00:57:11,925 --> 00:57:15,845
I'm going to adjust.

620
00:57:44,374 --> 00:57:45,458
Fuck

621
00:57:46,084 --> 00:57:48,294
Fuck, he's dead.

622
00:57:48,711 --> 00:57:50,088
We've got to get out of here now!

623
00:57:50,296 --> 00:57:50,797
Damm it.

624
00:57:50,922 --> 00:57:52,632
This is Alpha Nine.
We're in deep shit.

625
00:57:52,632 --> 00:57:53,883
I'll get on the Barret.

626
00:57:53,925 --> 00:57:54,676
Go, go, go!

627
00:57:54,801 --> 00:57:56,427
Yeah, we're taking incoming fire.

628
00:57:56,511 --> 00:57:57,428
Go, go, go!

629
00:57:57,512 --> 00:57:59,556
- No, Sanborn, don't come up here
- Got it!

630
00:57:59,639 --> 00:58:01,349
Go, buddy, Stay low!
Stay Low!

631
00:58:01,432 --> 00:58:02,433
I have two KIA,

632
00:58:03,184 --> 00:58:06,771
correction, three KIA...
our grid last lock stat...

633
00:58:07,564 --> 00:58:08,147
Stay low!

634
00:58:08,231 --> 00:58:09,399
Can you get me some help?

635
00:58:11,901 --> 00:58:13,236
- Behind you
- Yeah

636
00:58:30,169 --> 00:58:31,337
Breathe easy

637
00:58:33,631 --> 00:58:35,216
- I got movement
- Yeah

638
00:58:35,967 --> 00:58:37,301
On the ridge of that house

639
00:58:41,597 --> 00:58:43,141
Eight hundred and fifty meters

640
00:58:44,016 --> 00:58:45,727
- See it
- By the window

641
00:58:46,894 --> 00:58:50,314
- You got target
- Got it

642
00:58:57,155 --> 00:58:58,865
All right, here little left.

643
00:58:59,907 --> 00:59:01,242
Just breathe easy

644
00:59:09,542 --> 00:59:12,503
- I'm out of ammo
- Hmm?

645
00:59:13,588 --> 00:59:14,505
I'm out of ammo.

646
00:59:14,714 --> 00:59:17,091
Eldridge, we need ammo.

647
00:59:21,637 --> 00:59:22,555
Where is it?

648
00:59:23,514 --> 00:59:25,224
Check on the dead guy, man.

649
00:59:25,474 --> 00:59:26,642
It's on the dead man.

650
00:59:33,107 --> 00:59:34,191
Eldridge!

651
00:59:34,483 --> 00:59:35,568
I'm looking.

652
00:59:38,904 --> 00:59:40,281
We need that ammo, man.

653
00:59:40,615 --> 00:59:41,615
All right, man.

654
00:59:43,409 --> 00:59:44,577
Oh, here.

655
00:59:47,621 --> 00:59:48,706
Thanks

656
01:00:02,136 --> 01:00:03,387
All right. Got it.

657
01:00:03,429 --> 01:00:04,889
Same target.

658
01:00:08,392 --> 01:00:09,560
It's fucking jammed.

659
01:00:10,394 --> 01:00:11,312
Let me see it.

660
01:00:13,522 --> 01:00:14,440
Fuck!

661
01:00:14,774 --> 01:00:19,320
Aw, shit. The blood's
making it jam, Eldridge.

662
01:00:19,945 --> 01:00:20,863
Shit!

663
01:00:20,988 --> 01:00:23,199
You gotta clean the blood off, man.
It's making 'em jam.

664
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:24,575
Specialist!

665
01:00:26,702 --> 01:00:28,996
- Clean the blood off.
- Okay

666
01:00:35,461 --> 01:00:36,837
Clean it. Clean it.

667
01:00:37,796 --> 01:00:38,881
You gotta clean it, man.

668
01:00:39,006 --> 01:00:40,633
- How?
- Spit and rub,

669
01:00:44,136 --> 01:00:44,970
All right

670
01:00:46,305 --> 01:00:48,349
Spit and rub, buddy.
Spit and rub.

671
01:00:51,226 --> 01:00:54,396
It's not working, it's not coming off.

672
01:00:58,859 --> 01:01:02,363
Spit and rub, Spit and rub.
Here, take it out.

673
01:01:04,740 --> 01:01:06,533
Use your camel, Use your camel.
Where is it?

674
01:01:06,867 --> 01:01:08,827
You all right?

675
01:01:09,161 --> 01:01:10,245
Here, use that.

676
01:01:13,999 --> 01:01:15,167
Just breathe, buddy.

677
01:01:15,376 --> 01:01:16,627
Come on, Just breathe in.

678
01:01:16,919 --> 01:01:18,962
Good. Here, squeeze.

679
01:01:19,755 --> 01:01:21,548
- Got it?
- Yeah

680
01:01:22,716 --> 01:01:25,636
Rub that olive, baby.
Come on, you got it.

681
01:01:35,062 --> 01:01:37,022
You're doing good, man.
You're doing real good.

682
01:01:39,274 --> 01:01:40,818
- Got 'em?
- Yeah

683
01:01:41,985 --> 01:01:43,445
I'm going to keep you safe,
buddy, all right?

684
01:01:43,737 --> 01:01:45,447
Now let's get these bastards,
Scan your sectors.

685
01:01:45,697 --> 01:01:46,949
Scan your sectors.

686
01:01:54,957 --> 01:01:56,667
Kill that fuckin' asshole.

687
01:01:58,835 --> 01:02:00,087
Son of a bitch.

688
01:02:11,348 --> 01:02:14,518
Nice, he's down.
2nd one out of range.

689
01:02:15,602 --> 01:02:17,396
Twenty meters to
the right of the building.

690
01:02:22,901 --> 01:02:23,902
I got him.

691
01:02:26,613 --> 01:02:27,781
Fire when ready.

692
01:02:35,956 --> 01:02:38,166
He's moving, he's moving.
To the building.

693
01:02:38,542 --> 01:02:40,669
- Follow him You got him?
- Got him

694
01:02:45,507 --> 01:02:46,508
He's down.

695
01:02:48,760 --> 01:02:51,513
Goodnight. Thanks for playing.

696
01:03:01,731 --> 01:03:03,608
Window, the window. At the window,

697
01:03:09,364 --> 01:03:10,365
He's still there.

698
01:03:26,172 --> 01:03:28,466
Left window.
Left window, Got him?

699
01:03:28,800 --> 01:03:29,718
Got him.

700
01:03:49,404 --> 01:03:50,405
He's down.

701
01:04:47,462 --> 01:04:50,381
- Hey, Owen?
- Yeah?

702
01:04:51,174 --> 01:04:54,010
Can you grab the juice?
out of the pack please?

703
01:04:54,052 --> 01:04:54,802
Sure

704
01:05:07,607 --> 01:05:08,858
I think we're out.

705
01:05:10,026 --> 01:05:12,737
- Got anything left to drink?
- You could try that one.

706
01:05:33,508 --> 01:05:34,425
Thank you.

707
01:06:00,868 --> 01:06:03,537
Drink, drink it.

708
01:07:07,393 --> 01:07:09,103
Things are real quiet.

709
01:07:09,478 --> 01:07:12,189
Yeah, I don't like it.

710
01:07:32,209 --> 01:07:35,129
- Hey, Will?
- Yeah?

711
01:07:36,213 --> 01:07:38,007
At your six o'clock.

712
01:07:38,632 --> 01:07:41,719
I see movement on the bridge.
Right on the tracks.

713
01:07:43,721 --> 01:07:45,097
Well, handle it.

714
01:07:49,685 --> 01:07:51,103
Should I fire?

715
01:07:52,438 --> 01:07:53,689
It's your call, buddy.

716
01:08:23,093 --> 01:08:24,344
Good job.

717
01:08:54,916 --> 01:08:56,084
Hey, Sanborn.

718
01:09:00,756 --> 01:09:02,090
I think we're done.

719
01:09:15,645 --> 01:09:17,189
Okay? You all right?

720
01:09:20,942 --> 01:09:23,070
That's what you get for hitting
your fucking team leader, motherfucker.

721
01:09:25,947 --> 01:09:28,158
- Man
- I'll be right back, I gotta piss.

722
01:09:28,950 --> 01:09:30,035
Owen

723
01:09:30,535 --> 01:09:32,662
Another round, boy.
That's your order.

724
01:09:32,746 --> 01:09:34,956
Well, yes, sir. Sgt, James, sir.

725
01:09:35,248 --> 01:09:36,792
You're not very good
with people, are you, sir?

726
01:09:36,875 --> 01:09:38,502
But you're a good warrior,
Give me your mug.

727
01:09:39,920 --> 01:09:40,754
There ya go, sir.

728
01:09:40,795 --> 01:09:43,798
You were well on the field
of battle today, specialist.

729
01:09:44,508 --> 01:09:45,592
Cheers

730
01:09:53,600 --> 01:09:55,227
Uh, I'm too old for this shit.

731
01:10:00,732 --> 01:10:03,443
- I was scared.
- Yeah?

732
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:07,238
Well, everyone's a coward
about something, you know.

733
01:10:10,033 --> 01:10:12,577
You're good. You're real good.

734
01:10:12,661 --> 01:10:14,454
Just what do we have here?

735
01:10:15,372 --> 01:10:18,041
Will has possessions.

736
01:10:19,167 --> 01:10:21,044
I didn't know you owned anything, Will.

737
01:10:21,127 --> 01:10:22,754
Let's see what you got here, Will.

738
01:10:25,340 --> 01:10:26,257
Who is that?

739
01:10:26,508 --> 01:10:27,842
That's my son,

740
01:10:29,511 --> 01:10:32,931
he's a tough little bastard,
nothing like me.

741
01:10:32,972 --> 01:10:34,849
You mean to tell me you married?

742
01:10:36,935 --> 01:10:40,188
Well, you know,
I had a girlfriend and...

743
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,441
...she got pregnant,
so we got married.

744
01:10:44,317 --> 01:10:45,568
We got divorced.

745
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:50,156
Or I thought we got divorced.

746
01:10:50,281 --> 01:10:53,618
She's still living in the house.
And she says we're still together,

747
01:10:53,701 --> 01:10:57,288
so I don't know,
What does that make her?

748
01:10:57,622 --> 01:11:01,042
Dumb for still being with your ass.

749
01:11:03,044 --> 01:11:03,962
Hey

750
01:11:04,045 --> 01:11:05,505
She ain't fuckin' dumb,
all right?

751
01:11:05,797 --> 01:11:07,048
She's just loyal.

752
01:11:08,842 --> 01:11:11,469
She's just loyal. That's all,
How 'bout you guys?

753
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:15,765
You got... you got a girl?
What do you got?

754
01:11:16,224 --> 01:11:19,644
My only problem is the girl I do like,

755
01:11:20,436 --> 01:11:22,981
I can't stop her from talking
about babies, man.

756
01:11:23,147 --> 01:11:25,108
Well, give her your sperm, stud.

757
01:11:26,109 --> 01:11:27,485
Go on. Do it.

758
01:11:27,902 --> 01:11:30,154
- C'mon, chicken. Just give it to her.
- No! Hell no!

759
01:11:30,154 --> 01:11:31,155
Make babies

760
01:11:31,239 --> 01:11:34,659
I know when I'm ready, and I
ain't ready for that yet, I know that.

761
01:11:34,993 --> 01:11:38,913
Well, well...
what do we have here?

762
01:11:40,498 --> 01:11:41,958
Uh, components.

763
01:11:43,251 --> 01:11:45,545
They're bomb parts, signatures.

764
01:11:45,586 --> 01:11:47,630
Yeah, I see that, but
what they doing under your bed?

765
01:11:50,550 --> 01:11:51,801
Well...

766
01:11:58,599 --> 01:11:59,600
Ah-ha,

767
01:11:59,726 --> 01:12:01,185
There we go, this one...

768
01:12:01,978 --> 01:12:05,648
This one is from the UN building.

769
01:12:05,731 --> 01:12:09,402
Flaming car, dead man's switch... Boom,

770
01:12:09,777 --> 01:12:11,279
This guy was great, I like him.

771
01:12:12,822 --> 01:12:14,699
Ah... Look at this one.

772
01:12:15,533 --> 01:12:19,787
This one, y'all, is from
our first call together.

773
01:12:21,205 --> 01:12:25,042
This box is full of stuff
that almost killed me.

774
01:12:25,751 --> 01:12:26,919
And what about this one?

775
01:12:27,211 --> 01:12:29,338
- Where's this one from, Will?
- It's my wedding ring.

776
01:12:30,214 --> 01:12:32,258
Like I said,
stuff that almost killed me.

777
01:12:33,759 --> 01:12:38,139
You know, I just think
it's really interesting

778
01:12:38,306 --> 01:12:39,557
to hold something in your hand
that could have killed anyone.

779
01:12:40,558 --> 01:12:43,311
Damn that, It's all shit
from radio shack.

780
01:12:45,938 --> 01:12:47,106
It's interesting.

781
01:12:47,857 --> 01:12:49,317
I think it's interesting too.

782
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:51,152
Well, I think you hit me harder
than I hit you

783
01:12:51,152 --> 01:12:54,322
therefore I owe you a punch.

784
01:12:54,363 --> 01:12:56,073
Now get your ass up, C'mon.

785
01:12:56,407 --> 01:12:59,327
C'mon, He's right.
Let's go, C'mon,

786
01:13:00,911 --> 01:13:01,912
Come on!

787
01:13:01,996 --> 01:13:03,789
All right, hold on, boys.
We need some rules,

788
01:13:04,040 --> 01:13:05,750
Sanborn, no face shots.

789
01:13:05,875 --> 01:13:06,792
Oh, there's gonna be a face shot.

790
01:13:06,959 --> 01:13:08,294
Sergeant James, take off your shirt.

791
01:13:09,211 --> 01:13:10,379
Yes, sir.

792
01:13:11,047 --> 01:13:12,048
What happened?

793
01:13:12,381 --> 01:13:14,258
My momma dropped me
when I was a baby,

794
01:13:15,176 --> 01:13:16,343
Looks like frag scars,

795
01:13:16,385 --> 01:13:20,431
- Let it go, Eldridge, C'mon,
- All right,

796
01:13:20,806 --> 01:13:22,266
Nice and big

797
01:13:27,313 --> 01:13:28,481
Oohh!

798
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:37,448
You like that, huh?

799
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:39,116
That's all you got?

800
01:13:39,700 --> 01:13:40,868
Come on,

801
01:13:43,704 --> 01:13:45,289
Bring some, C'mon,

802
01:13:47,082 --> 01:13:48,250
Ooh!

803
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:54,757
Wooh, God damn!

804
01:13:55,257 --> 01:13:56,717
That's gotta hurt.

805
01:14:00,429 --> 01:14:01,889
- You all right, man?
- Oh, yeah

806
01:14:03,933 --> 01:14:05,809
- Oh, he's all right.
- Get up, bitch.

807
01:14:08,103 --> 01:14:09,271
All right, bitch.

808
01:14:12,608 --> 01:14:14,318
- What do you got now?
- Get the fuck off me?

809
01:14:14,401 --> 01:14:16,070
- What do you got?
- Get off me, you mother fucker.

810
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:17,946
What do you got? What do you got?

811
01:14:17,988 --> 01:14:21,075
Wooh, he's a wild one.
We got a wild one.

812
01:14:21,116 --> 01:14:23,160
C'mon, Sanborn.
Get him. That's right.

813
01:14:23,202 --> 01:14:26,872
- Ride him, baby.
- Get off me

814
01:14:26,955 --> 01:14:28,582
- C'mon, bitch
- C'mon, guys

815
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:30,376
What do you got?

816
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:32,086
Get off me

817
01:14:32,294 --> 01:14:33,462
Hey, hey, hey!

818
01:14:44,723 --> 01:14:46,683
I'm just kidding,
motherfucker, shit!

819
01:14:48,977 --> 01:14:50,437
You're all right, Sanborn.

820
01:14:50,771 --> 01:14:51,688
You're all right, man.

821
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:53,941
Owen, get this guy a drink. C'mon.

822
01:14:55,776 --> 01:14:57,194
- You got him?
- Yeah, I got him,

823
01:14:57,236 --> 01:14:58,612
- All right, here.
- All right.

824
01:14:58,654 --> 01:15:00,447
- See you later,
- Be safe - All right.

825
01:15:00,531 --> 01:15:03,784
All right, come on big boy.
Damn, boy, you need to get on a diet.

826
01:15:04,243 --> 01:15:06,453
He hurt his knee,. C'mon, man.

827
01:15:07,871 --> 01:15:10,874
Steps. C'mon.

828
01:15:12,543 --> 01:15:14,586
Step, step.

829
01:15:19,841 --> 01:15:24,554
All right, lay down.
All right, Get some rest.

830
01:15:25,472 --> 01:15:30,185
Hey, James, you think I got
what it takes to put on the suit?

831
01:15:32,729 --> 01:15:33,814
Hell, no.

832
01:15:35,565 --> 01:15:37,025
Night, boy.

833
01:16:31,162 --> 01:16:31,913
Oh!

834
01:16:36,376 --> 01:16:38,086
- Good morning, Colonel.
- Good morning.

835
01:16:38,837 --> 01:16:43,133
Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death
of sitting behind a desk all the time.

836
01:16:46,094 --> 01:16:48,138
That'd be a privilege.
Hop in, Colonel.

837
01:16:52,559 --> 01:16:53,643
Hey, Doc.

838
01:16:54,561 --> 01:16:56,187
Not to insult your intelligence, sir.

839
01:16:56,271 --> 01:16:59,441
but if the shit hits the fan,
please don't fire out the Humvee.

840
01:16:59,607 --> 01:17:02,402
The round will just bounce around,
and someone might get shot.

841
01:17:03,028 --> 01:17:06,031
- I don't like getting shot.
- Understood, Sergeant,

842
01:17:19,002 --> 01:17:20,086
Oh, it's a pretty standard mission.

843
01:17:20,128 --> 01:17:22,172
We're just here to pick up
some unexploded ordinance.

844
01:17:22,839 --> 01:17:25,550
Sergeant James is
gonna see what the deal is

845
01:17:26,134 --> 01:17:28,178
and then hopefully we'll be
gone in a couple minutes.

846
01:17:28,761 --> 01:17:30,597
- We've gotta gear up.
- For what?

847
01:17:30,597 --> 01:17:31,931
Security hasn't gone in.

848
01:17:32,140 --> 01:17:33,600
Go in quiet.

849
01:17:33,641 --> 01:17:35,518
- Radios off - Roger
- Roger that

850
01:17:36,227 --> 01:17:38,271
- Glad you came.
- Stay safe, all right

851
01:20:31,277 --> 01:20:32,528
Psst. Psst.

852
01:20:42,830 --> 01:20:43,914
Clear

853
01:20:45,165 --> 01:20:46,000
Hey

854
01:20:46,333 --> 01:20:48,043
cigarette's still smoking.

855
01:20:52,047 --> 01:20:53,215
It's all our shit.

856
01:20:56,885 --> 01:20:58,595
Mother fucking goldmine.

857
01:21:00,514 --> 01:21:01,974
Watch out for trips

858
01:21:26,165 --> 01:21:27,249
I got something

859
01:21:40,762 --> 01:21:42,014
I know this kid

860
01:21:43,307 --> 01:21:45,434
His name's Beckham. He sells DVDs,

861
01:21:46,351 --> 01:21:48,228
You ever see a body bomb before, man?

862
01:21:50,981 --> 01:21:53,275
It's disgusting. Let's get outta here,

863
01:21:53,984 --> 01:21:54,902
Hold it.

864
01:21:56,403 --> 01:22:01,450
Eldridge, want you to grab all the C4 and
deck cord you can get your hands on.

865
01:22:04,578 --> 01:22:06,371
Let's get all this
ordnance outta here.

866
01:22:06,455 --> 01:22:08,498
And we're just gonna...
we're gonna blow the place.

867
01:22:09,750 --> 01:22:11,126
Roger, Just blow it.

868
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:20,927
What are you doing?

869
01:22:22,512 --> 01:22:24,806
Yeah? Putting
the stones in to move.

870
01:22:26,433 --> 01:22:27,601
Yeah, that's really wonderful

871
01:22:28,477 --> 01:22:29,978
but it's a little
bit unsafe today,

872
01:22:32,606 --> 01:22:34,066
Yeah, it's a little unsafe.

873
01:22:34,107 --> 01:22:35,484
So maybe... I don't know.

874
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:39,070
I'm thinking maybe we should move?

875
01:22:39,279 --> 01:22:40,113
No?

876
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:58,256
Fuck

877
01:23:03,261 --> 01:23:04,346
- You all right?
- Yeah

878
01:23:04,387 --> 01:23:05,639
- You?
- Yeah

879
01:23:11,728 --> 01:23:13,855
- You all right, man?
- Yeah

880
01:23:15,065 --> 01:23:16,316
No one in or out, okay?

881
01:23:58,858 --> 01:24:00,485
Cancel the det, Cancel the det.

882
01:24:22,757 --> 01:24:24,968
- What the fuck is he doing?
- I don't know, man.

883
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:28,221
I don't know.

884
01:25:56,892 --> 01:25:57,893
I'm coming out.

885
01:25:59,061 --> 01:26:00,229
Roger that.

886
01:26:20,791 --> 01:26:22,585
- Where are you from?
- New York.

887
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,128
The Big Apple.

888
01:26:24,837 --> 01:26:26,213
I'm from Iraq

889
01:26:26,422 --> 01:26:28,549
I love it here.
This is a beautiful place.

890
01:26:28,591 --> 01:26:30,968
But it's not too safe here, okay?

891
01:26:31,010 --> 01:26:34,680
So, I think we need -
we need to move, please.

892
01:26:58,954 --> 01:27:00,414
You think it's that little Beckham?

893
01:27:00,748 --> 01:27:02,166
No, I don't.

894
01:27:02,708 --> 01:27:05,002
- You're positive?
- Sure.

895
01:27:05,711 --> 01:27:08,005
Hey, I don't know, man.
They all look the same, right?

896
01:27:08,672 --> 01:27:09,590
I don't know.

897
01:27:09,632 --> 01:27:12,968
- Will seemed sure. That was weird.
- Very weird.

898
01:27:15,387 --> 01:27:17,848
Please, just move.

899
01:27:18,182 --> 01:27:20,559
Move, Move.

900
01:27:20,601 --> 01:27:25,147
Move on. Thank you.

901
01:27:28,609 --> 01:27:29,693
I'm sorry.

902
01:27:30,486 --> 01:27:31,862
Will's very weird.

903
01:27:32,404 --> 01:27:34,365
I mean he keeps bomb
parts under his bed.

904
01:27:34,615 --> 01:27:37,534
I'll bet you he won't keep any
of these parts under his bed.

905
01:27:39,703 --> 01:27:40,704
Bye-bye

906
01:27:42,581 --> 01:27:44,958
Yeah, bye-bye. Bye, thank you.

907
01:27:45,876 --> 01:27:46,960
Hey, Colonel

908
01:27:47,836 --> 01:27:48,670
Let's go

909
01:27:48,712 --> 01:27:51,090
So long, thank you.

910
01:27:58,388 --> 01:27:59,765
IED!

911
01:28:01,391 --> 01:28:02,392
Cambridge!

912
01:28:07,356 --> 01:28:08,816
Get back, get down

913
01:28:08,899 --> 01:28:10,442
Stay back

914
01:28:10,484 --> 01:28:12,444
Stay back, Sanborn, keep 'em back

915
01:28:13,278 --> 01:28:14,029
Is anyone hurt?

916
01:28:14,154 --> 01:28:16,782
Cambridge! Fuck!

917
01:28:17,574 --> 01:28:19,034
Where's Cambridge!

918
01:28:20,035 --> 01:28:21,745
Cambridge, come out,
We gotta go.

919
01:28:21,787 --> 01:28:22,871
Oh, he's dead.

920
01:28:23,747 --> 01:28:26,291
Hey, we gotta find
Cambridge, Doc!

921
01:28:26,500 --> 01:28:28,961
- Eldridge!
- Doc!

922
01:28:29,962 --> 01:28:32,589
Eldridge, c'mon, man, C'mon

923
01:28:32,631 --> 01:28:34,675
I just saw him.
He was walking right here.

924
01:28:34,716 --> 01:28:37,970
I know. He's dead.
Look, he's dead, Okay?

925
01:28:51,984 --> 01:28:53,235
It's all right, man.

926
01:28:53,318 --> 01:28:55,362
It'll be all right, man,.

927
01:29:19,052 --> 01:29:19,970
Hello?

928
01:29:22,222 --> 01:29:23,306
Hello?

929
01:29:24,224 --> 01:29:25,392
Will?

930
01:29:27,561 --> 01:29:28,478
Hello?

931
01:29:31,773 --> 01:29:33,233
Hello?

932
01:30:24,993 --> 01:30:26,327
Hey, let me ask you a question,

933
01:30:26,619 --> 01:30:29,330
What happened to the little kid?
that used to work here?

934
01:30:29,372 --> 01:30:32,876
Sorry, man,
English I... no English.

935
01:30:32,959 --> 01:30:36,212
No-no English,
You no speak English now.

936
01:30:36,296 --> 01:30:39,466
Little kid, Beckham is his name.
He sells... sells DVDs,

937
01:30:39,549 --> 01:30:42,302
DVD, One DVD, $5,

938
01:30:42,385 --> 01:30:43,720
Oh, Jesus Christ.

939
01:30:44,012 --> 01:30:45,555
- $5,
- Excuse me, soldier.

940
01:30:45,847 --> 01:30:47,015
you in charge of this area here?

941
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,017
- What's up?
- You know this guy?

942
01:30:50,101 --> 01:30:52,312
How do we know that
he's not giving intel to insurgents

943
01:30:52,478 --> 01:30:53,938
, telling them
where to drop mortars?

944
01:30:54,147 --> 01:30:55,565
I think he's just selling DVDs.

945
01:30:55,648 --> 01:30:57,233
Well, he's a security risk,
We should get rid of him.

946
01:30:58,109 --> 01:30:59,194
What are you looking at?

947
01:30:59,277 --> 01:31:02,697
- He's just selling DVDs, man.
All the merchants are clear. - By who?

948
01:31:02,739 --> 01:31:04,949
I couldn't do anything with him
without the say-so from my CO.

949
01:31:07,827 --> 01:31:08,828
Okay, Fuck

950
01:31:10,455 --> 01:31:11,998
Fuck

951
01:31:48,034 --> 01:31:49,410
Does this change anything?

952
01:31:50,661 --> 01:31:51,829
You speak English now.
Don't you?

953
01:31:52,914 --> 01:31:54,540
- Yalla, yalla, drive!
- Okay

954
01:32:16,479 --> 01:32:18,272
- OK
- Is this his house?

955
01:32:18,773 --> 01:32:20,024
Beckham's house?

956
01:32:28,908 --> 01:32:29,742
Wait here

957
01:32:39,794 --> 01:32:40,795
Fuck

958
01:33:39,812 --> 01:33:41,522
Psst, psst, shh.

959
01:33:42,731 --> 01:33:43,899
You speak English?

960
01:33:44,149 --> 01:33:45,943
English, French, Arabic.

961
01:33:45,985 --> 01:33:47,069
Good, Open you vest.

962
01:33:48,529 --> 01:33:50,322
Ah, stay there. Stay.

963
01:33:51,115 --> 01:33:52,575
Tell me what you know about Beckham.

964
01:33:53,075 --> 01:33:53,993
For whom?

965
01:33:54,243 --> 01:33:57,496
Beckham, 12-year-old boy, body bomb.
Stay right there

966
01:33:58,205 --> 01:34:00,249
- I don't know
- You don't know

967
01:34:00,332 --> 01:34:03,585
But please, sit down.
I am Professor Navid,

968
01:34:03,961 --> 01:34:05,212
This is my home.

969
01:34:05,838 --> 01:34:08,924
You are a guest.
Please, sit down.

970
01:34:11,510 --> 01:34:12,970
I'm a guest?

971
01:34:15,222 --> 01:34:19,351
Just... I'm looking for
the people responsible

972
01:34:20,811 --> 01:34:22,521
for-for-for Beckham,

973
01:34:23,147 --> 01:34:25,357
You are CIA, no?

974
01:34:26,692 --> 01:34:28,986
I am very pleased to see
CIA in my home.

975
01:34:29,737 --> 01:34:31,447
Please, sit.

976
01:34:38,954 --> 01:34:40,289
How can I...

977
01:34:44,877 --> 01:34:46,378
Be careful, the gun can go off.

978
01:35:43,685 --> 01:35:45,312
USA friendly coming in.

979
01:35:45,437 --> 01:35:48,273
Stop! Stop! Get the fuck down!

980
01:35:48,273 --> 01:35:49,733
USA friendly,.

981
01:35:49,775 --> 01:35:52,235
On your knees,
Get on your knees now.

982
01:35:52,319 --> 01:35:56,448
On your knees.
You will be shot. Don't move.

983
01:35:56,490 --> 01:35:58,200
On your knees. Down now.

984
01:35:58,241 --> 01:36:01,828
- Open your jacket!
- Opening my jacket,

985
01:36:01,870 --> 01:36:03,663
Cover. Get him down,

986
01:36:03,872 --> 01:36:05,123
- On the ground,
- I have a weapon

987
01:36:05,290 --> 01:36:06,917
Don't fucking move

988
01:36:07,375 --> 01:36:09,085
- Tower, hold cover. Searching.
- I have a weapon.

989
01:36:10,962 --> 01:36:12,464
- Gun.
- Like I said,.

990
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,091
Weapons clear.

991
01:36:15,425 --> 01:36:16,343
ID

992
01:36:17,177 --> 01:36:18,428
What the fuck are you doing?

993
01:36:18,720 --> 01:36:20,096
I was at a whorehouse.

994
01:36:20,931 --> 01:36:25,810
All right, If I let you in, will
you tell me where it is exactly?

995
01:36:27,854 --> 01:36:28,521
Yeah

996
01:36:30,899 --> 01:36:32,943
James, do you copy?

997
01:36:42,494 --> 01:36:44,120
James, do you have your ears on?

998
01:36:47,957 --> 01:36:48,792
James?

999
01:36:50,877 --> 01:36:52,253
This is James, What's up?

1000
01:37:08,061 --> 01:37:10,188
- Hey
- What's up, man?

1001
01:37:13,191 --> 01:37:15,401
Look, we have a tank explosion
in the Green Zone.

1002
01:37:15,485 --> 01:37:17,112
We have to post-blast assessment,

1003
01:37:17,237 --> 01:37:18,613
see if it was a suicide bomber,

1004
01:37:18,696 --> 01:37:20,240
and if so, how the fuck did he do it?

1005
01:37:21,324 --> 01:37:22,075
Okay.

1006
01:37:22,867 --> 01:37:24,118
Where'd you say you were again?

1007
01:37:24,744 --> 01:37:25,912
I didn't, sergeant.
Let's go.

1008
01:37:28,581 --> 01:37:30,124
What happened to your head, James?

1009
01:37:37,715 --> 01:37:38,800
Hey, you ready?

1010
01:37:39,634 --> 01:37:40,885
Game face, buddy. Let's go.

1011
01:37:46,724 --> 01:37:48,685
- You ready?
- Let's do this.

1012
01:37:48,726 --> 01:37:50,603
Rock and roll. Moving out.

1013
01:38:04,325 --> 01:38:06,202
USA friendlies coming through.

1014
01:38:26,973 --> 01:38:28,516
Make room, guys. Make room.

1015
01:38:41,154 --> 01:38:43,114
Hey, Sanborn.

1016
01:38:43,948 --> 01:38:44,866
Oh, shit!

1017
01:38:49,996 --> 01:38:52,415
Get a medic! Get a medic!

1018
01:39:11,642 --> 01:39:13,102
- An oil tanker?
- Yep,

1019
01:39:16,689 --> 01:39:18,065
That's a pretty long flight, huh?

1020
01:41:25,901 --> 01:41:27,778
This is the edge of the blast radius.

1021
01:41:33,867 --> 01:41:35,244
Jesus.

1022
01:41:36,411 --> 01:41:37,663
So, where's our triggerman?

1023
01:41:37,996 --> 01:41:39,623
Burnt up in the flames, man.

1024
01:41:40,165 --> 01:41:41,625
Suicide bomber.

1025
01:41:42,125 --> 01:41:44,253
We're never going
to find a body in that shit.

1026
01:41:44,503 --> 01:41:45,879
What if there was no body?

1027
01:41:47,714 --> 01:41:49,132
What if it was a remote det?

1028
01:41:53,971 --> 01:41:56,348
A really good bad guy
hides out in the dark, right?

1029
01:41:59,559 --> 01:42:03,230
Right here.
Perfect vantage point,

1030
01:42:03,855 --> 01:42:07,984
outside the blast radius to sit back
and watch us clean up their mess.

1031
01:42:10,779 --> 01:42:12,489
- Want to go out there?
- Yes, I do

1032
01:42:15,075 --> 01:42:19,079
- I could stand to get in a little
trouble. - No, man. This is bullshit.

1033
01:42:19,371 --> 01:42:23,917
You got three infantry platoons behind
you whose job it is to go Haji huntin'.

1034
01:42:23,959 --> 01:42:25,168
That ain't our fuckin' job.

1035
01:42:25,168 --> 01:42:27,921
You don't say no to me, Sanborn.
I say no to you.

1036
01:42:28,004 --> 01:42:30,132
You know there are guys
watching us right now.

1037
01:42:30,173 --> 01:42:33,426
They're laughing at this,
Okay, I'm not okay with that.

1038
01:42:34,386 --> 01:42:37,139
Now, turn off your god dammed
torch 'cause we're going.

1039
01:43:46,624 --> 01:43:48,418
Now we know where their
oil tanker came from.

1040
01:43:48,501 --> 01:43:50,128
No shit. Same kind.

1041
01:43:50,170 --> 01:43:51,796
- We're close
- Yeah

1042
01:43:52,088 --> 01:43:53,882
The alley ways are probably
set up on a grid.

1043
01:43:53,965 --> 01:43:56,342
We're going to need
to spit up, flush 'em out.

1044
01:43:57,135 --> 01:43:59,596
Sanborn, you take one,
Eldridge, take two,

1045
01:43:59,637 --> 01:44:02,640
I got three.
Rally point at your intersection.

1046
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:04,017
- Ready, move
- Wait, rally point when?

1047
01:44:05,268 --> 01:44:06,019
Fuck

1048
01:44:32,754 --> 01:44:34,130
''Ipsura, ipsura,''
Go, go!

1049
01:45:19,884 --> 01:45:21,761
Shit, Ahh.

1050
01:45:28,309 --> 01:45:29,143
Shit

1051
01:45:29,227 --> 01:45:31,437
- You got contact?
- Who was it? What's going on?

1052
01:45:31,521 --> 01:45:33,314
- What do you got?
- It's Eldridge.

1053
01:45:34,857 --> 01:45:35,942
Go, go.

1054
01:45:35,983 --> 01:45:37,443
Man down! Man down!

1055
01:45:38,736 --> 01:45:40,112
Shit, Shit, Shit!

1056
01:45:40,446 --> 01:45:43,199
- Negative, negative. It's not him.
- He's gone.

1057
01:45:43,699 --> 01:45:44,951
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

1058
01:45:44,992 --> 01:45:46,869
Tankers and troops are that way.

1059
01:45:47,203 --> 01:45:48,704
- Let's go this way.
- Fuck

1060
01:46:11,644 --> 01:46:13,854
Use your torch, On three.

1061
01:46:16,023 --> 01:46:16,941
Ready?

1062
01:46:17,733 --> 01:46:20,111
One, two, three.

1063
01:46:22,446 --> 01:46:23,614
- Fuck!
- Shit

1064
01:46:29,453 --> 01:46:31,080
Softy, softy, softy.

1065
01:46:42,466 --> 01:46:43,300
On three

1066
01:46:43,717 --> 01:46:45,511
One, Two, Three

1067
01:46:49,849 --> 01:46:51,559
Now! Go, go, go...

1068
01:46:54,270 --> 01:46:57,231
- Eldridge, you okay?
- Fuck, dude, I'm hit.

1069
01:46:57,231 --> 01:46:59,108
Hit him in the fuckin' leg.

1070
01:46:59,191 --> 01:47:01,151
Come on

1071
01:47:01,193 --> 01:47:04,613
- Am I dead? Am I dead?
- No, You're fine, man.

1072
01:47:05,155 --> 01:47:06,865
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1073
01:47:08,534 --> 01:47:10,327
I'm going to put some
pressure down. Come on.

1074
01:47:10,786 --> 01:47:11,870
You're all right.

1075
01:47:13,080 --> 01:47:15,291
Look at me, look at me,
You all right.

1076
01:47:15,624 --> 01:47:19,878
All right, buddy. You ready to get up?
On three, ready? One, two, three

1077
01:48:42,544 --> 01:48:45,714
Hey, what's up, man? What's up, man?

1078
01:48:45,964 --> 01:48:47,924
Wanna buy some DVDs?
Wanna play some soccer?

1079
01:48:49,468 --> 01:48:50,385
What's up?

1080
01:48:51,178 --> 01:48:52,429
Come on, man.
Wanna play some...

1081
01:49:10,113 --> 01:49:12,073
Aww, Fuck.

1082
01:49:17,537 --> 01:49:18,455
How you doing, buddy?

1083
01:49:19,206 --> 01:49:20,749
Doc says you're going to be okay.

1084
01:49:21,124 --> 01:49:23,585
My fucking femur is shattered
in nine places.

1085
01:49:24,836 --> 01:49:27,839
He said I'll be walking in six months
if I'm fucking lucky.

1086
01:49:27,923 --> 01:49:30,217
- Six months ain't bad, huh?
- It's not bad?

1087
01:49:30,592 --> 01:49:32,385
Fuckin' sucks, man,

1088
01:49:32,427 --> 01:49:34,137
- Ah, ah!
- Take it easy,

1089
01:49:36,264 --> 01:49:39,017
You see that? You fuckin' see that?

1090
01:49:39,809 --> 01:49:42,646
That's what happens when
you shoot someone, you motherfucker.

1091
01:49:43,188 --> 01:49:44,356
Sorry

1092
01:49:44,981 --> 01:49:47,025
- Sorry, Owen.
- Fuck you, Will.

1093
01:49:47,484 --> 01:49:48,818
Really, Fuck you.

1094
01:49:49,861 --> 01:49:53,615
Thanks for saving my life,
but we didn't have to go out.

1095
01:49:53,782 --> 01:49:56,618
Looking for trouble to get
your fucking adrenaline fix, you fuck.

1096
01:49:58,703 --> 01:50:00,497
Hey, take care of yourself, Owen.

1097
01:50:00,538 --> 01:50:01,998
Come home safe, man.

1098
01:50:02,165 --> 01:50:04,125
- See you on the other side, man.
- All right

1099
01:50:05,293 --> 01:50:07,253
Let's get out of this fucking desert!

1100
01:50:13,426 --> 01:50:14,427
Don't move

1101
01:50:14,511 --> 01:50:17,597
If you keep
walking we will shoot you.

1102
01:50:17,639 --> 01:50:19,349
Move him back

1103
01:50:20,350 --> 01:50:21,893
Keep that translator back

1104
01:50:21,935 --> 01:50:23,895
- But the bomb was forced on him.
- Get him back!

1105
01:50:23,978 --> 01:50:26,022
Don't move! Stay still

1106
01:50:28,066 --> 01:50:32,195
If you keep walking we will shoot you.
If you keep walking we will shoot.

1107
01:50:32,320 --> 01:50:33,863
Get that translator back, now!

1108
01:50:37,826 --> 01:50:41,830
Give him room, give him room.

1109
01:50:49,212 --> 01:50:50,755
Hey, what do you got?

1110
01:50:50,838 --> 01:50:52,340
He came walking up to our checkpoint,

1111
01:50:52,382 --> 01:50:55,176
said he had a bomb strapped to him,
But he's sorry, doesn't want it to go off.

1112
01:50:55,218 --> 01:50:57,178
Then he starts begging us
to take it off of him.

1113
01:50:57,512 --> 01:50:59,097
Help this man,
he's not a bad man.

1114
01:50:59,138 --> 01:51:01,766
He's not a bad man? He got
a bomb strapped to him,

1115
01:51:02,642 --> 01:51:04,602
This is a joke, he's trying
to pull us closer.

1116
01:51:04,602 --> 01:51:05,853
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

1117
01:51:06,187 --> 01:51:10,358
All right, look...
Tell him to open his shirt slowly

1118
01:51:10,858 --> 01:51:12,902
and see what's inside.

1119
01:51:16,322 --> 01:51:18,449
Slowly, slowly...

1120
01:51:29,252 --> 01:51:30,628
Jesus

1121
01:51:31,963 --> 01:51:34,257
All right Sergeant,
I need a 75-meter perimeter.

1122
01:51:34,340 --> 01:51:36,551
- Get these guys back.
- Give me 75 meters. Get back.

1123
01:51:38,302 --> 01:51:40,972
You tell him to get on his knees
and touch the sky, okay?

1124
01:51:42,014 --> 01:51:43,015
Slowly

1125
01:51:43,975 --> 01:51:44,725
Get down

1126
01:51:49,272 --> 01:51:50,982
Okay, I need your radio.

1127
01:51:51,399 --> 01:51:53,359
- Can't we just shoot him?
- No

1128
01:51:53,401 --> 01:51:55,361
He's a family man.
He's not a bad man.

1129
01:51:55,444 --> 01:51:57,238
He's asking for help, only help.

1130
01:51:57,280 --> 01:52:01,742
Yeah, all right. You don't want
to die, get back! I got it.

1131
01:52:05,288 --> 01:52:07,915
Listen, I know
we've had our differences.

1132
01:52:08,124 --> 01:52:12,169
It happened, all right.
It's water under the bridge.

1133
01:52:13,754 --> 01:52:15,631
This is suicide, man.

1134
01:52:17,216 --> 01:52:18,926
That's why they call it
a suicide bomb, right?

1135
01:52:23,055 --> 01:52:24,140
Let's do this. Come on.

1136
01:52:24,223 --> 01:52:26,267
He says the bomb may
have a timer, please hurry.

1137
01:52:27,435 --> 01:52:29,145
- We're good, Ready?
- Yep

1138
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:35,735
Go get 'em

1139
01:52:35,943 --> 01:52:36,944
- Let's do it
- See you

1140
01:52:49,540 --> 01:52:51,500
Get your hands up

1141
01:52:54,670 --> 01:52:55,921
He says he has a family

1142
01:52:57,548 --> 01:52:58,632
Please help him,

1143
01:53:04,764 --> 01:53:06,724
Now, listen

1144
01:53:06,766 --> 01:53:09,852
Look, It'd be a lot easier for me
to disarm this

1145
01:53:09,894 --> 01:53:11,687
if I just shoot you. Do you understand?

1146
01:53:16,358 --> 01:53:17,610
What's he saying?

1147
01:53:17,651 --> 01:53:21,488
He says I don't wish to die, I have a
family... Please take this off me.

1148
01:53:22,406 --> 01:53:26,785
Tell him to put his hands behind his
head or I'll be very happy to shoot him.

1149
01:53:32,875 --> 01:53:34,335
Look, that's not what I said.

1150
01:53:34,376 --> 01:53:37,796
Tell him to put his hands behind
his head or I will shoot him.

1151
01:53:40,674 --> 01:53:41,508
Listen

1152
01:53:44,094 --> 01:53:45,012
Listen, listen.

1153
01:53:46,513 --> 01:53:50,184
You understand?

1154
01:53:52,561 --> 01:53:53,312
Okay

1155
01:53:57,024 --> 01:53:58,025
What do you got here?

1156
01:53:59,735 --> 01:54:01,111
He has four children.

1157
01:54:06,492 --> 01:54:07,576
Shit

1158
01:54:12,373 --> 01:54:15,834
Sanborn, we got a timer,
and we got a lot of wires, man.

1159
01:54:15,834 --> 01:54:17,961
I'm going to need
a little help on this.

1160
01:54:18,003 --> 01:54:19,463
Roger that, tell me what you need.

1161
01:54:20,047 --> 01:54:21,215
Bolt cutters

1162
01:54:21,381 --> 01:54:23,842
You gotta get down here
in two minutes or we're all fucked.

1163
01:54:23,926 --> 01:54:25,385
Roger that,
I'll be there in 30 seconds.

1164
01:54:29,473 --> 01:54:31,517
He says, please, I have a family.

1165
01:54:34,353 --> 01:54:35,187
Sst

1166
01:54:35,229 --> 01:54:39,316
I know, it's okay.
You're all right. You're all right,.

1167
01:54:43,779 --> 01:54:44,947
Please, don't leave me.

1168
01:54:50,494 --> 01:54:51,870
You weren't fuckin' kidding.

1169
01:54:52,329 --> 01:54:54,790
Nope, What's this made out of?

1170
01:55:00,671 --> 01:55:01,588
Oh, man

1171
01:55:01,755 --> 01:55:03,465
This case's harder than steel

1172
01:55:05,175 --> 01:55:06,426
Shit

1173
01:55:06,468 --> 01:55:08,762
- What's our time?
- We got two minutes - Shit

1174
01:55:09,137 --> 01:55:11,598
We're going need a torch
to get this off.

1175
01:55:11,640 --> 01:55:13,600
Well, we don't have one of those in
the fucking truck, man.

1176
01:55:13,684 --> 01:55:14,351
He's dead, man.

1177
01:55:14,393 --> 01:55:15,644
Hold on, man. Let me think.
Just Let me think.

1178
01:55:15,978 --> 01:55:18,355
We're going to handle this.
It's okay. We got this,

1179
01:55:19,147 --> 01:55:20,691
Shh, okay.

1180
01:55:21,817 --> 01:55:23,068
Now listen, you're gonna get back.

1181
01:55:27,656 --> 01:55:30,033
It's just we don't
got enough time, Sanborn.

1182
01:55:30,325 --> 01:55:32,619
I just gotta...
I gotta get these bolts off.

1183
01:55:33,412 --> 01:55:36,665
No, We got a minute and a half, man.
We gotta get out of here.

1184
01:55:36,706 --> 01:55:39,459
- I'll handle this. Just go.
- Come on, man.

1185
01:55:39,543 --> 01:55:41,378
Look, I'm right behind ya. Just go.

1186
01:55:41,378 --> 01:55:43,088
Fuck him! Come on, Let's go,

1187
01:55:43,171 --> 01:55:45,966
- Sanborn, I got the suit. Just go,
- James!

1188
01:55:46,007 --> 01:55:49,845
Sanborn, you have 45 seconds.
You have 45 seconds. Sanborn, Leave,

1189
01:55:50,178 --> 01:55:51,805
You're fucking dead, man. Dead.

1190
01:55:51,888 --> 01:55:53,932
Go!

1191
01:55:53,974 --> 01:55:56,434
- Everybody get back!
- Go, go!

1192
01:56:02,023 --> 01:56:03,191
We got one.

1193
01:56:04,150 --> 01:56:06,444
Go, get back.

1194
01:56:09,155 --> 01:56:14,035
I can't. There's too many locks.
There's too many, I can't do it,

1195
01:56:14,578 --> 01:56:16,371
I can't get it off. I'm sorry, Okay!

1196
01:56:16,663 --> 01:56:18,039
You understand? I'm sorry,

1197
01:56:19,040 --> 01:56:21,793
I'm sorry. You hear me? I'm sorry,

1198
01:56:21,835 --> 01:56:23,962
- Get down now!
- I can help him.

1199
01:56:26,840 --> 01:56:30,010
Everybody stay down!

1200
01:56:53,158 --> 01:56:53,992
James!

1201
01:56:54,367 --> 01:56:56,411
Everybody up and out,
James!

1202
01:57:43,124 --> 01:57:44,125
You all right?

1203
01:57:47,670 --> 01:57:48,588
Aw, man,

1204
01:57:51,674 --> 01:57:53,301
I fuckin' hate this place.

1205
01:57:56,262 --> 01:57:57,513
Here, man. Have a hit.

1206
01:58:11,986 --> 01:58:13,946
I'm not ready to die, James.

1207
01:58:16,407 --> 01:58:18,034
Well, you're not going
to die out here, bro.

1208
01:58:19,702 --> 01:58:21,287
Another two inches.

1209
01:58:24,290 --> 01:58:26,959
Shrapnel zings by, slices my throat.

1210
01:58:28,628 --> 01:58:31,088
I bleed out like a pig in the sand,

1211
01:58:33,674 --> 01:58:35,468
Nobody'll give a shit.

1212
01:58:38,387 --> 01:58:41,641
I mean, my parents'll care,
but they don't count, man, Who else?

1213
01:58:49,482 --> 01:58:51,025
I don't even have a son.

1214
01:58:57,949 --> 01:59:00,242
Well, you're going to have
plenty of time for that, amigo.

1215
01:59:00,952 --> 01:59:02,828
- Naw, man
- You know?

1216
01:59:04,830 --> 01:59:05,915
I'm done,

1217
01:59:11,462 --> 01:59:12,713
I want a son,

1218
01:59:16,884 --> 01:59:18,678
I want a little boy, Will.

1219
01:59:25,643 --> 01:59:27,853
I mean, how do you
do it, you know?

1220
01:59:29,688 --> 01:59:31,065
Take the risk?

1221
01:59:38,906 --> 01:59:41,033
I don't know, I just...

1222
01:59:43,828 --> 01:59:44,995
- I guess I don't think about it.

1223
01:59:58,759 --> 02:00:01,053
But you realize every time you suit up,

1224
02:00:02,429 --> 02:00:03,889
every time we go out

1225
02:00:05,057 --> 02:00:07,518
it's life or death.
You roll the dice

1226
02:00:09,853 --> 02:00:11,021
and you deal with it.

1227
02:00:13,566 --> 02:00:15,150
You recognize that, don't you?

1228
02:00:20,948 --> 02:00:22,032
Yeah

1229
02:00:32,251 --> 02:00:33,502
Yeah, I do.

1230
02:00:35,379 --> 02:00:36,839
But I don't know why.

1231
02:00:39,008 --> 02:00:40,092
Yeah.

1232
02:00:49,810 --> 02:00:54,106
I don't know, JT.
You know why I am the way I am?

1233
02:00:59,903 --> 02:01:00,988
Naw, I don't.

1234
02:02:03,425 --> 02:02:07,012
- Wow! You did some shopping.
- Yeah.

1235
02:02:07,763 --> 02:02:09,473
I got some soda.
We done?

1236
02:02:11,183 --> 02:02:13,393
You want to go get us some cereal
and I'll meet you at the checkout?

1237
02:02:14,728 --> 02:02:16,521
Okay, cereal.

1238
02:02:20,984 --> 02:02:21,902
Where?

1239
02:03:21,586 --> 02:03:25,006
Some guy drove his truck to
the middle of an Iraqi market,

1240
02:03:25,882 --> 02:03:27,842
starts passing out free candies.

1241
02:03:27,926 --> 02:03:30,387
All the kids coming running up,
the families stuff,

1242
02:03:32,639 --> 02:03:33,723
He detonates.

1243
02:03:36,559 --> 02:03:37,936
They're saying 59 are dead.

1244
02:03:48,488 --> 02:03:50,198
You know they need more bomb techs.

1245
02:03:54,369 --> 02:03:55,620
You want to chop those up for me?

1246
02:03:57,539 --> 02:03:59,249
Boing, boing, boing

1247
02:04:07,131 --> 02:04:07,882
Yeah

1248
02:04:10,218 --> 02:04:11,928
You love playing with that.

1249
02:04:12,929 --> 02:04:15,139
You love playing with all
your stuffed animals.

1250
02:04:16,266 --> 02:04:21,854
You love your mommy, your daddy,
your nature pajamas.

1251
02:04:22,063 --> 02:04:24,816
You love everything, don't you? Yeah

1252
02:04:26,484 --> 02:04:27,735
You know what, buddy?

1253
02:04:28,861 --> 02:04:30,113
Once you get older,

1254
02:04:31,072 --> 02:04:36,411
some of the things that you love
might not seem so special anymore.

1255
02:04:37,245 --> 02:04:38,955
Like your Jack In The Box,

1256
02:04:42,083 --> 02:04:46,879
Maybe you realize it's just
a piece of tin and a stuffed animal

1257
02:04:49,132 --> 02:04:53,261
and then you forget
the few things you really love,

1258
02:04:56,597 --> 02:05:00,101
And by the time you get to my age
maybe it's only one or two things,

1259
02:05:08,734 --> 02:05:10,611
With me I think it's one,

1260
02:05:47,356 --> 02:05:49,650
- Welcome to Delta Company
- Sergeant
