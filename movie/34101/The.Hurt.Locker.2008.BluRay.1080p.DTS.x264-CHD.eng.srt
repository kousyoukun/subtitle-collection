1
00:01:17,765 --> 00:01:18,849
Go, go!

2
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,991
Approaching.

3
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:03,886
I think we have touchdown.

4
00:02:08,857 --> 00:02:11,660
Little to the right

5
00:02:32,589 --> 00:02:34,499
Hello mum

6
00:02:38,387 --> 00:02:39,938
Now, push it in

7
00:02:43,183 --> 00:02:44,201
I can't

8
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:45,986
What do you mean you can't? Pretend it's your dick, man.

9
00:02:46,895 --> 00:02:48,434
How about I pretend it's your dick?

10
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:49,940
You'll never get in if you did that.

11
00:02:50,774 --> 00:02:53,190
- Here, let me have a shot.    - Give me a second,

12
00:02:53,195 --> 00:02:55,871
- No, come on    - My dick, man    - Go

13
00:03:01,452 --> 00:03:02,861
Fucker

14
00:03:05,873 --> 00:03:07,866
- Got that    - Yeah

15
00:03:10,085 --> 00:03:11,620
Here we go

16
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,990
- Oh, look at that     - Nice 155, huh?     - Yeah

17
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:23,969
It's going to do some fucking damage.

18
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:27,219
Hey, Eldridge, looks like we're going to need a charge!

19
00:03:27,227 --> 00:03:28,484
I got that.

20
00:03:28,562 --> 00:03:32,140
Figured four blocks that'll give us about 20 pounds of bang total.

21
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:34,910
That blast is going to roast straight out there.

22
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,610
The shell will probably kick out there, and most of the shrapnel

23
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:40,069
is going to shoot straight up in a beautiful umbrella pattern.

24
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:40,984
Yep

25
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:44,531
We're gonna get some smaller pieces and shell fragments this way,

26
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:46,576
but we'll be okay if we're behind the Humvee,

27
00:03:46,581 --> 00:03:48,882
- Bring the bot back, we'll load it up.    - No problem.

28
00:03:51,543 --> 00:03:53,303
Bot is moving.

29
00:04:08,102 --> 00:04:09,861
Let me know what you got, Eldridge.

30
00:04:10,312 --> 00:04:11,058
Good to go.

31
00:04:11,063 --> 00:04:13,996
All right, wagon's set up. Bot moves.

32
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:18,399
Uh-oh, we got goats, guys!

33
00:04:18,404 --> 00:04:20,522
Goats 12:00, Watch out,

34
00:04:20,739 --> 00:04:22,733
Load them little bastards up.

35
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:40,976
- Oh, shit,    - Shit,

36
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:43,997
Oh, fuck!

37
00:04:44,096 --> 00:04:46,218
Wagon's having a bad day, boys.

38
00:04:46,223 --> 00:04:48,483
- You build that?    - No, the U.S. Army did,

39
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:50,702
All right, looks like I'm going down there

40
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:52,766
You don't like waiting around this beautiful neighborhood?

41
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:53,889
Oh, I love it.

42
00:05:03,657 --> 00:05:06,276
So, if everything looks okay, when I get down there

43
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:08,524
I'm just going to set it up and bip it,

44
00:05:08,537 --> 00:05:10,664
Give these people something to think about,

45
00:05:11,165 --> 00:05:13,454
Want them to know if they're gonna leave a bomb on the side of the road for us,

46
00:05:13,459 --> 00:05:15,205
we're just going to blow up their little fuckin' road,

47
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:16,203
Sounds good

48
00:05:17,546 --> 00:05:19,585
Craving a burger; is that strange?

49
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,542
- Not for you    - No, okay

50
00:05:21,633 --> 00:05:23,043
Helmet on

51
00:05:23,927 --> 00:05:25,337
Happy trails

52
00:05:33,854 --> 00:05:35,225
Blaster One, can you read me?

53
00:05:35,230 --> 00:05:37,599
Roger that, Blaster one. You're good to go.

54
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,065
You're looking good, Blaster One.

55
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:06,628
Nice and hot in here.

56
00:06:13,602 --> 00:06:14,795
150
One fifty

57
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,055
Roger that, 150 meters

58
00:06:30,994 --> 00:06:31,992
Hi!

59
00:06:32,246 --> 00:06:34,159
- Where are you from?    - Whoa, whoa, whoa!

60
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:35,824
Where are you from? Where are you from?    - Stop!

61
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:37,121
California?

62
00:06:37,126 --> 00:06:38,560
- Hey, get out of here, man    - Where?

63
00:06:38,585 --> 00:06:41,121
Hey, this ain't no fuckin' meet and greet. Now get out of here.

64
00:06:41,755 --> 00:06:42,789
Now

65
00:06:46,051 --> 00:06:47,044
Go!

66
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,904
You making friends again, Sanborn?

67
00:06:58,272 --> 00:06:59,614
All day long

68
00:07:06,405 --> 00:07:07,881
25
Twenty-five

69
00:07:07,948 --> 00:07:11,460
Twenty-five meters, Roger that You are now in the kill zone.

70
00:07:13,078 --> 00:07:14,990
Thanks for reminding me.

71
00:07:15,164 --> 00:07:17,257
That's what I'm here for, baby.

72
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:19,576
Okay.

73
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,628
The debts look good.

74
00:07:30,429 --> 00:07:31,547
Roger that.

75
00:08:01,502 --> 00:08:03,637
I'm laying on the charge.

76
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:05,914
Nice and sweet.

77
00:08:07,424 --> 00:08:09,126
We're good to go.

78
00:08:09,593 --> 00:08:10,993
I'm coming back.

79
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:16,425
- Five meters out.    - Five meters, Roger that.

80
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:17,805
Hey, Sanborn

81
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:21,571
- You know what this place needs?    - I'm listening.

82
00:08:21,855 --> 00:08:23,181
Needs grass

83
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,605
We gonna start our grass business?

84
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:27,853
That's right, man.

85
00:08:28,237 --> 00:08:31,990
I'm going to sell the grass, you're going to cut it.

86
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,419
It's going to be called ''Sanborn and Sons'',

87
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,422
We'll be rich.

88
00:08:39,665 --> 00:08:43,118
I like that, crabgrass, St. Augustine, man.

89
00:08:43,377 --> 00:08:44,890
I'm a scholar on this shit,

90
00:08:45,504 --> 00:08:49,808
How about this? You sell it, I fertilize it.

91
00:08:50,843 --> 00:08:53,670
- 25    - 25 meters, Roger that

92
00:08:54,013 --> 00:08:55,255
Sanborn!

93
00:08:55,848 --> 00:08:58,300
Butcher shop, 2:00! dude has a phone!

94
00:08:58,434 --> 00:08:59,676
Why is Eldridge running?

95
00:09:00,394 --> 00:09:02,763
- Make him put it down!    - Put down the phone!

96
00:09:02,938 --> 00:09:04,598
Come on, guys, talk to me,

97
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:07,334
Drop the phone! Drop your phone!

98
00:09:07,359 --> 00:09:09,815
Hey, burn him, Eldridge! Burn him!

99
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,481
- Put down the cell phone!    - Eldridge, burn him!

100
00:09:12,614 --> 00:09:14,194
- Get out of the way,    - Drop your phone!

101
00:09:14,199 --> 00:09:16,376
Make him put it down! Go get it!

102
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:19,755
- Come on, Eldridge!    - I can't get him shot!

103
00:09:35,888 --> 00:09:37,406
Thompson!

104
00:10:06,502 --> 00:10:07,786
Anywhere's good,

105
00:10:29,316 --> 00:10:31,368
- Is that everything?    - Yeah,

106
00:11:07,396 --> 00:11:08,430
Yeah?

107
00:11:12,735 --> 00:11:13,977
Come in.

108
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:17,664
Sergeant James?

109
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:22,823
JT Sanborn, man.

110
00:11:22,828 --> 00:11:24,867
Hey! Hi, how are you? Will.

111
00:11:24,872 --> 00:11:26,952
Welcome to Bravo Company; welcome to Camp Victory,

112
00:11:26,957 --> 00:11:29,621
Camp Victory? I thought this was Camp Liberty,

113
00:11:29,626 --> 00:11:32,499
Oh! No, they changed that about a week ago.

114
00:11:32,504 --> 00:11:33,914
Victory sounds better.

115
00:11:34,715 --> 00:11:37,421
- All right. Well, at least I'm in the right place, right?    - Yeah,

116
00:11:37,426 --> 00:11:39,465
While you're here, can you help me move this thing real quick?

117
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:40,549
Yeah, no problem.

118
00:11:40,554 --> 00:11:42,676
Maybe you shouldn't take this down.

119
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,303
We get a lot of mortars at night.

120
00:11:44,308 --> 00:11:47,598
The plywood on the windows help with the lateral fray coming through.

121
00:11:47,603 --> 00:11:48,766
That's why it's up there.

122
00:11:48,771 --> 00:11:51,352
Yeah, well, it's not going to stop a mortar round

123
00:11:51,357 --> 00:11:53,016
from coming in through the roof, you know.

124
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:56,453
Besides, I like the sunshine.

125
00:11:57,446 --> 00:11:59,818
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about Thompson.

126
00:11:59,823 --> 00:12:03,072
- I know he was a good tech.    - Yeah, he was,

127
00:12:03,077 --> 00:12:04,656
He was a great team leader, too,

128
00:12:04,661 --> 00:12:07,618
Yeah, I'm not trying to fill his shoes or anything,

129
00:12:07,623 --> 00:12:09,549
I'm just... I'm just going to do my best.

130
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,578
- Appreciate it,    - All right.

131
00:12:12,836 --> 00:12:14,162
Cool

132
00:12:17,341 --> 00:12:19,042
Home sweet home, right?

133
00:12:26,308 --> 00:12:29,094
Aren't you glad the Army has all these tanks parked here?

134
00:12:29,228 --> 00:12:32,099
Just in case the Russians come we have to have a big tank battle.

135
00:12:32,231 --> 00:12:36,063
I'd rather be on the side with the tanks, just in case, rather than not have them.

136
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:37,603
Yeah, but they don't do anything.

137
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,789
Anyone comes alongside a Humvee we're dead.

138
00:12:41,115 --> 00:12:43,166
Anybody even looks at you funny we're dead,

139
00:12:43,325 --> 00:12:46,115
Pretty much the bottom line is if you're in Iraq, you're dead.

140
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:47,908
How's a fuckin' tank supposed to stop that?

141
00:12:47,913 --> 00:12:50,716
- Would you shut up, Owen please?    - Sorry

142
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,928
Just trying to scare the new guy.

143
00:12:53,335 --> 00:12:55,846
I saw a little bit in Afghanistan, too.

144
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:07,524
- Get your eyes on the road, Eldridge.    - Copy that

145
00:13:13,564 --> 00:13:14,806
Yalla!

146
00:13:14,982 --> 00:13:16,183
Move!

147
00:13:53,187 --> 00:13:55,267
Blaster One, this is Victory Main.

148
00:13:55,272 --> 00:13:57,824
Have you reached your 10-20, yet? Over.

149
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:09,461
Where the hell are the guys who called this in?

150
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:28,547
Victory Main, Victory Main, this is Blaster Mike.

151
00:14:28,764 --> 00:14:31,733
Interrogative, do you have an update on position? Over.

152
00:14:33,852 --> 00:14:40,675
Victory Main, figures to follow, Three-four-five-three is your grid.

153
00:14:46,824 --> 00:14:49,905
Well, that's exactly where the hell I am and I don't see anybody in fatigues,

154
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:52,337
Give us a second to confirm.

155
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:54,368
Watch your feet!

156
00:14:54,373 --> 00:14:58,076
Set visual is three-four five-three,

157
00:14:58,585 --> 00:14:59,998
Got the Humvee

158
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:04,666
Friendly!

159
00:15:07,553 --> 00:15:08,712
Friendly!

160
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:27,397
Ah, here we go.

161
00:15:29,324 --> 00:15:30,529
They abandoned their vehicle.

162
00:15:30,534 --> 00:15:32,998
We got an empty Humvee over here, James.

163
00:15:33,162 --> 00:15:35,280
Yeah, I got it.

164
00:15:38,208 --> 00:15:39,368
Let's move.

165
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:42,996
Friendly,

166
00:15:47,634 --> 00:15:49,811
- Morning, boys.    - Sir.

167
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:52,089
Don't tell me the bomb's in here with you guys.

168
00:15:52,848 --> 00:15:55,175
- Step out and I'll show you what's going on    - All right

169
00:15:55,392 --> 00:15:57,453
Down on that block 20 meters.

170
00:15:57,478 --> 00:15:59,558
This side of the mosque. east side of the street.

171
00:15:59,563 --> 00:16:01,560
our informant says he saw a pair of wires

172
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:03,145
going into a rubble pile

173
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,060
- It's a possible IED.    - Yeah

174
00:16:05,152 --> 00:16:07,025
- I trust this guy. I know him.    - Okay,

175
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,984
- I'll handle it.    - Do you want to talk him or...    - No.

176
00:16:08,989 --> 00:16:11,583
Good, Keep your boys back, We'll be good, Thank you,

177
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:14,114
Specialist, bring up the Humvee,

178
00:16:14,119 --> 00:16:14,948
What's going on?

179
00:16:14,953 --> 00:16:16,463
I'm going to break out the suit.

180
00:16:17,665 --> 00:16:19,950
- What about the bot?    - I'll take care of it.

181
00:16:20,084 --> 00:16:22,082
Don't you want to send the bot down there to see what it looks like?

182
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:23,165
I'll handle it.

183
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:25,514
That's kind of tight down here, James.

184
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:42,097
Ready?

185
00:16:45,776 --> 00:16:46,935
Good?

186
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:00,077
You don't have to go down there, We already have the bot halfway up.

187
00:17:00,082 --> 00:17:01,325
I'll be all right.

188
00:17:12,136 --> 00:17:15,772
First day, figure you want to take it easy, right?

189
00:17:22,146 --> 00:17:23,142
How's it looking, Eldridge?

190
00:17:23,147 --> 00:17:24,865
- Good to go    - Let's do it

191
00:17:35,284 --> 00:17:37,031
- Got tools?    - Got tools

192
00:17:37,036 --> 00:17:38,904
All right. Let's rock and roll, man.

193
00:17:57,681 --> 00:18:00,300
- He's a rowdy boy    - He's reckless

194
00:18:13,197 --> 00:18:14,873
Blaster One, what's going on?

195
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:17,985
Blaster One! What are you doing?

196
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,367
Blaster One, this is Blaster Mike

197
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:23,382
What's with the smoke on the side of the road?

198
00:18:25,959 --> 00:18:27,813
Hey, James, can you hear me?

199
00:18:27,836 --> 00:18:31,331
What's going on with the smoke on the side of the road? Over

200
00:18:32,633 --> 00:18:33,962
Creating a diversion

201
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:35,460
From what? Is there a threat?

202
00:18:36,095 --> 00:18:37,963
Eldridge, get up on the wall, Move!

203
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,092
Tell me what you see, specialist

204
00:18:43,769 --> 00:18:45,220
All right, I got him

205
00:18:45,604 --> 00:18:46,725
He's walking down range.

206
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:49,395
James, the smoke is killing my visibility.

207
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:53,328
Where are you in relationship to the IED? Are you within 100 meters yet?

208
00:18:53,654 --> 00:18:57,557
Hell, I don't know, but I'll tell you when I'm standing over it, cowboy.

209
00:19:34,194 --> 00:19:35,729
Take cover!

210
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,446
Oh, no, A car stopped in front of him, Sanborn.

211
00:19:44,496 --> 00:19:47,286
Shit, James! James, come back now.

212
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:49,735
EOD pulled a nine on this Haji in a car.

213
00:19:52,338 --> 00:19:53,764
Want me to send backup?

214
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:55,499
I got it.

215
00:19:55,507 --> 00:19:57,960
- Sanchez, Hayes!    - Negative! Negative!

216
00:19:58,052 --> 00:19:59,214
Stand down

217
00:19:59,219 --> 00:20:01,296
The blast will come up the block

218
00:20:01,388 --> 00:20:03,135
Stay clear around the corner

219
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:06,176
EOD has the situation under control, over

220
00:20:07,186 --> 00:20:09,863
- Where you going?    - Hold your fire on my command!

221
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:12,099
Want to back up?

222
00:20:17,321 --> 00:20:18,564
Get out of the car!

223
00:20:20,115 --> 00:20:21,775
- Get out of the car!    - Come on!

224
00:20:25,621 --> 00:20:27,464
What the fuck are you doing?

225
00:20:30,626 --> 00:20:31,785
Back up!

226
00:20:35,756 --> 00:20:37,291
Hello?

227
00:20:52,189 --> 00:20:53,532
Want to get back?

228
00:21:15,129 --> 00:21:16,330
It's that way.

229
00:21:21,218 --> 00:21:22,461
Back

230
00:21:42,573 --> 00:21:43,690
Taxi's moving.

231
00:21:45,532 --> 00:21:46,305
Get out of the car!

232
00:21:46,792 --> 00:21:49,100
Stop! Stop the car!

233
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,842
- Get out, get out of the fucking car!    - Get out the ground!

234
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,394
- Underground!    - Stay down!

235
00:21:58,255 --> 00:22:00,974
Well, if he wasn't an insurgent, he sure the hell is now.

236
00:22:02,051 --> 00:22:03,877
Roger that! That's real funny.

237
00:22:58,816 --> 00:22:59,975
Got something

238
00:23:11,578 --> 00:23:12,905
Oh, baby!

239
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:45,979
Gotcha

240
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:01,662
All right

241
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:08,502
We're done

242
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:13,302
Good to go

243
00:24:13,307 --> 00:24:14,967
Come down, specialist.

244
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:17,386
Roger

245
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,193
Got a wire

246
00:24:34,495 --> 00:24:35,821
Hang on

247
00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:43,428
Where are you going?

248
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:59,344
Secondary

249
00:24:59,436 --> 00:25:00,224
Shit

250
00:25:00,229 --> 00:25:02,097
Take cover! Get in the wall! Get in the wall!

251
00:26:47,086 --> 00:26:49,913
That wasn't so bad. First time working together. What do you think?

252
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:57,746
I think us working together means I talk to you and you talk to me

253
00:26:58,138 --> 00:27:00,774
- We going on a date, Sanborn?    - No

254
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:02,426
We're going on a mission.

255
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:05,679
and my job is to keep you safe so we can keep going on missions.

256
00:27:05,771 --> 00:27:07,306
It's combat, buddy.

257
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:15,993
Hey,

258
00:27:16,115 --> 00:27:17,736
It's just 39 days.

259
00:27:17,741 --> 00:27:19,584
Thirty-eight if we survive today.

260
00:27:37,761 --> 00:27:39,688
Hey, it's ''Mr., Be All You Can Be''!

261
00:27:40,472 --> 00:27:41,590
What's up, doc?

262
00:27:41,807 --> 00:27:43,175
Not much, How are you?

263
00:27:44,018 --> 00:27:44,898
I'm good.

264
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:50,532
Got a question about that song, ''Be All You Can Be''.

265
00:27:51,191 --> 00:27:54,453
What if all I can be is dead on the side of an Iraqi road?

266
00:27:54,528 --> 00:27:55,941
I mean, I think it's logical.

267
00:27:55,946 --> 00:28:01,560
This is war, people die all the time. Why not me?

268
00:28:02,536 --> 00:28:03,705
You got to change the record in our head.

269
00:28:03,746 --> 00:28:05,584
You gotta start thinking about other things.

270
00:28:05,664 --> 00:28:07,366
Okay, Stop obsessing... Right now.

271
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:09,683
What are you thinking about?

272
00:28:09,835 --> 00:28:11,870
You want to know what I'm thinking about, doc?     - Yeah

273
00:28:12,671 --> 00:28:14,122
This is what I'm thinking about, doc.

274
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:20,354
Here's Thompson, okay. He's dead, he's alive.

275
00:28:21,096 --> 00:28:24,091
Here's Thompson. He's dead, he's alive.

276
00:28:25,225 --> 00:28:26,969
He's dead. He's alive.

277
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:35,397
Yo, what's up, my nigger? What's up, man? You cool?

278
00:28:35,402 --> 00:28:38,442
Come on, You want the cool shit? Come on, come on, It's the tight shit, man,

279
00:28:38,447 --> 00:28:40,944
Wanna buy DVD? Wanna buy DVD?

280
00:28:40,949 --> 00:28:43,110
Fuck you, Come, come, please, please1

281
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:44,782
New releases, look.

282
00:28:44,787 --> 00:28:47,447
Hello, Hello! Want to buy DVDs? Very good, Very good,

283
00:28:47,706 --> 00:28:48,410
How much?

284
00:28:48,415 --> 00:28:49,912
One for five and two for nine,

285
00:28:49,917 --> 00:28:51,151
Three for twelve.

286
00:28:51,335 --> 00:28:54,041
Three for thirteen and I don't give you tax. Very good, man. Look.

287
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:55,959
- Look...    - No tax?

288
00:28:55,964 --> 00:28:57,920
All right, What do you got? What do you got,

289
00:28:57,925 --> 00:29:01,423
You know, you smart shit, You not like those stupid fuck face.

290
00:29:01,428 --> 00:29:03,213
Yeah, I'm the smart guy.

291
00:29:03,597 --> 00:29:06,762
You're a smart kid, Give me your best one, okay?

292
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,348
- Here, this the best one.    - This is a good one?

293
00:29:09,353 --> 00:29:11,638
- Yeah, The best shit, man.    - Okay

294
00:29:11,855 --> 00:29:13,227
Here you go, I'll take one.

295
00:29:13,232 --> 00:29:15,105
- Keep the change    - Thank you

296
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,268
Want a cigarette?

297
00:29:16,694 --> 00:29:18,745
Get out of here, You shouldn't smoke.

298
00:29:20,531 --> 00:29:22,149
Thank you. Take it easy.

299
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:31,383
I need to talk to you about something before we go out again.

300
00:29:32,126 --> 00:29:33,285
What's that?

301
00:29:35,045 --> 00:29:37,164
- Yesterday    - Mm-hmm

302
00:29:38,298 --> 00:29:39,541
Wasn't cool

303
00:29:40,884 --> 00:29:44,396
Yeah, I know. You'll get it, though.

304
00:29:47,016 --> 00:29:49,860
- So, you're a ranger, huh?    - Yeah.

305
00:29:50,227 --> 00:29:53,739
I was in intelligence seven years before I joined EOD,

306
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:58,952
We ran missions in every shithole that you could possibly imagine.

307
00:30:01,405 --> 00:30:05,375
So, I'm pretty sure I can figure out a redneck piece of trailer trash like you.

308
00:30:07,286 --> 00:30:09,212
Looks like you're on the right track.

309
00:30:11,081 --> 00:30:12,466
We'll see you out there.

310
00:30:23,761 --> 00:30:24,962
Let's go, move!

311
00:30:31,352 --> 00:30:34,346
Shit, Get out of the way. Move!

312
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,685
Hello

313
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:43,108
- Where is it?    - It's behind the wall

314
00:30:43,113 --> 00:30:45,569
- All right! See any wires? Any smoke?

315
00:30:45,574 --> 00:30:46,737
No, I didn't look

316
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:47,863
So, how do you know it's a bomb?

317
00:30:47,868 --> 00:30:50,240
The car has been parked illegally

318
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:53,410
The suspension is sagging. There's definitely something heavy in the trunk,

319
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:56,992
Right. So, why don't you walk over there and peak inside and tell me what you see.

320
00:30:58,045 --> 00:30:59,998
You want me to go close to it?

321
00:31:00,631 --> 00:31:03,333
Yeah! No-no, I don't. I'm kidding.

322
00:31:55,853 --> 00:31:56,889
Shit

323
00:31:57,021 --> 00:31:58,680
It's coming from over here!

324
00:32:05,237 --> 00:32:06,538
Blaster One. You there?

325
00:32:12,453 --> 00:32:13,946
Blaster One, you hear me?

326
00:32:15,372 --> 00:32:16,865
Here

327
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:24,998
Shit

328
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:29,211
Let's go, guys.

329
00:32:31,221 --> 00:32:32,422
Let it go.

330
00:32:33,098 --> 00:32:34,480
I got top cover.

331
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:35,596
That's a negative, specialist.

332
00:32:35,601 --> 00:32:36,972
Eldridge, you stay with me.

333
00:32:36,977 --> 00:32:38,557
Sanborn, you take top covers.

334
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:39,596
Shit

335
00:33:19,603 --> 00:33:21,096
Blaster Mike in position

336
00:33:46,463 --> 00:33:47,639
What do you got?

337
00:33:47,673 --> 00:33:50,875
I got a through and through to the chest, but I got him stable.

338
00:33:51,093 --> 00:33:52,687
He's not going to make it.

339
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:56,883
We're leaving in 15 minutes. Got a survival wound, sir.

340
00:33:57,516 --> 00:33:59,526
He's not going to make it.

341
00:34:27,463 --> 00:34:28,780
Oh, God.

342
00:34:39,683 --> 00:34:42,277
- What's he doing?    - I don't know,

343
00:34:45,981 --> 00:34:47,144
What are you doing?

344
00:34:47,149 --> 00:34:49,584
There's enough bang in there to send us all to Jesus.

345
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:53,483
If I'm going to die, I'm going to die comfortable.

346
00:34:53,530 --> 00:34:55,499
I need my kit and my cans.

347
00:34:55,574 --> 00:34:57,276
What's going on down there, Eldridge?

348
00:34:57,534 --> 00:35:00,882
I'm getting his kit and his cans. Cover me, please.

349
00:35:10,839 --> 00:35:12,816
Kit and cans

350
00:35:29,191 --> 00:35:32,998
Got a Lot of deck cord, electrical

351
00:35:51,922 --> 00:35:54,132
I'm looking for this initiating system

352
00:36:21,535 --> 00:36:23,620
Well, it's not in the back seat.

353
00:36:25,706 --> 00:36:27,541
I don't think.

354
00:36:41,055 --> 00:36:43,181
All right, It's not in the back seat.

355
00:36:51,774 --> 00:36:55,147
Got a young man on the roof, your 9:00, keep an eye on him.

356
00:36:55,152 --> 00:36:56,681
Roger that

357
00:37:04,286 --> 00:37:06,054
It's not in the front seat.

358
00:37:11,877 --> 00:37:13,853
It's not in the door.

359
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:21,486
Not on the floors.

360
00:37:25,516 --> 00:37:27,084
Not in the glove box.

361
00:37:27,184 --> 00:37:29,515
If you haven't found it yet, it's probably under the car.

362
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:33,955
Yeah, no wire leads under... the car. It's all in here somewhere.

363
00:37:40,364 --> 00:37:42,277
- Hey, Sanborn    - Yeah

364
00:37:42,282 --> 00:37:45,322
You got eyes on some guy, with a video camera?

365
00:37:45,327 --> 00:37:46,699
No, Where?

366
00:37:46,704 --> 00:37:50,890
He's right at my 12:00, you see him? He's pointing the fucking thing at me

367
00:38:01,135 --> 00:38:03,757
- Shit    - Negative, I don't see him.

368
00:38:03,762 --> 00:38:07,899
Hey, Sanborn. He's right at my 12:00, look! 12:00!

369
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,118
Roger that, I got him.

370
00:38:14,148 --> 00:38:16,725
Getting ready to put me on YouTube.

371
00:38:17,318 --> 00:38:20,149
- Little shady.   - Yeah, he Looks shady. Keep an eye on him,

372
00:38:20,154 --> 00:38:22,189
Okay, So, what's the play?

373
00:38:23,365 --> 00:38:25,974
Be smart. Make a good decision, over

374
00:38:32,708 --> 00:38:34,601
Got more wire

375
00:38:39,173 --> 00:38:41,958
Leads fucking nowhere

376
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:44,736
Fuck!

377
00:38:45,387 --> 00:38:47,238
Hey, James, how you doing?

378
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,220
I'm wonderful, How are you?

379
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:52,287
You know, we've been here a while

380
00:38:53,604 --> 00:38:55,100
We need to get out of here soon.

381
00:38:55,105 --> 00:38:56,423
Uh-huh,

382
00:39:00,986 --> 00:39:04,522
We got a lot of eyes on us, James. We need to get out of here.

383
00:39:05,366 --> 00:39:09,094
Roger that, I might figure this out.

384
00:39:09,995 --> 00:39:12,238
James, we need to get out of here,

385
00:39:13,123 --> 00:39:15,308
James, do you copy?

386
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:17,686
Fuck it, I get it.

387
00:39:19,171 --> 00:39:21,995
Fuck me

388
00:39:28,931 --> 00:39:32,450
- Hey, how's it looking in there, soldier?    - All clear

389
00:39:32,893 --> 00:39:34,932
James, the evac is complete. We can leave.

390
00:39:34,937 --> 00:39:36,433
Let the engineers handle this mess,

391
00:39:36,438 --> 00:39:39,124
- We moving?    - That's affirmative

392
00:39:52,871 --> 00:39:54,118
Interesting

393
00:39:54,123 --> 00:39:56,741
What's up with James? He's not answering

394
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:59,994
Yeah, I think he removed his headset,

395
00:40:00,462 --> 00:40:03,836
Well, will you tell him to put his radio back on, please?

396
00:40:03,841 --> 00:40:05,129
Hey, James!

397
00:40:05,134 --> 00:40:09,993
Sergeant Sanborn is asking if you'll please put your headset back on.

398
00:40:16,103 --> 00:40:18,291
Uh... that's a negative.

399
00:40:18,313 --> 00:40:20,990
- That, yeah, that's not gonna happen.    - Shit!

400
00:40:36,290 --> 00:40:39,926
I got eyes on three guys at the Minaret at 6:00.

401
00:40:57,895 --> 00:41:01,226
- What the hell is he doing?    - I don't know what the fuck he's doing!

402
00:41:01,231 --> 00:41:03,541
Looks like, he's checking the oil.

403
00:41:40,854 --> 00:41:43,190
They're communicating with your cameraman.

404
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:44,520
This is real bad, man.

405
00:41:44,525 --> 00:41:46,543
Get behind the Jersey barrier.

406
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,112
I can't see James from here.

407
00:41:53,117 --> 00:41:54,843
Get down now!

408
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:01,441
We can go!

409
00:42:07,881 --> 00:42:09,441
Bastard

410
00:42:32,948 --> 00:42:34,758
We're done.

411
00:42:36,285 --> 00:42:40,013
Sanborn, let's get out of here.

412
00:42:54,386 --> 00:42:55,791
Woo

413
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:09,693
That was good.

414
00:43:19,912 --> 00:43:21,995
- Hey, James!    - What?

415
00:43:23,999 --> 00:43:26,518
Never turn your headset off again.

416
00:43:51,944 --> 00:43:53,850
You the guy in the bomb suit?

417
00:43:53,946 --> 00:43:57,055
No, sir, Sir, that's Sergeant James. He's right here.

418
00:43:57,116 --> 00:43:59,057
- Hey, James.    - Yeah?

419
00:43:59,118 --> 00:44:00,725
Someone's here to see you.

420
00:44:02,037 --> 00:44:04,451
You the guy in the flaming car. Sergeant James?

421
00:44:04,456 --> 00:44:06,766
Afternoon, sir Uh, yes, sir

422
00:44:07,084 --> 00:44:10,332
Well, that's just hot shit.

423
00:44:10,337 --> 00:44:12,814
You're a wild man, you know that?

424
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:14,920
- Uh, yes, sir    - He's a wild man

425
00:44:14,925 --> 00:44:16,426
You know that?

426
00:44:16,885 --> 00:44:18,653
I want to shake your hand.

427
00:44:18,846 --> 00:44:20,175
- Thank you, sir.    - Yeah

428
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,093
How many bombs have you disarmed?

429
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:24,805
Uh, I'm not quite sure.

430
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,098
- Sergeant?    - Yes, sir.

431
00:44:26,103 --> 00:44:27,871
I asked you a question.

432
00:44:29,481 --> 00:44:30,561
Eight hundred seventy-three, sir.

433
00:44:30,566 --> 00:44:34,986
Eight hundred! And seventy-three.

434
00:44:35,779 --> 00:44:37,359
That's just hot shit.

435
00:44:37,364 --> 00:44:39,533
Eight-hundred and seventy-three.

436
00:44:39,783 --> 00:44:42,485
- Counting today, sir, yes.    - That's gotta be a record.

437
00:44:44,204 --> 00:44:49,267
What's the best way to... go about disarming one of these things?

438
00:44:50,127 --> 00:44:52,287
The way you don't die, sir.

439
00:44:53,339 --> 00:44:54,710
That's a good one.

440
00:44:54,715 --> 00:44:58,209
That's spoken like a wild man. That's good.

441
00:45:14,318 --> 00:45:16,900
- Hey, what's up, man?    - Oh, hey, wait a minute,

442
00:45:16,905 --> 00:45:18,538
Look who it is.

443
00:45:19,782 --> 00:45:21,311
I want my five bucks back, buddy.

444
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:23,607
Five dollars for what, man? You crazy now?

445
00:45:23,619 --> 00:45:25,599
Yeah, The DVD you sold me was crap.

446
00:45:25,621 --> 00:45:28,785
You crazy, man. That's impossible. It's Hollywood special effects.

447
00:45:28,791 --> 00:45:30,396
No, It was shaky. It was out of focus, buddy.

448
00:45:30,417 --> 00:45:31,873
- What, you want donkey porn?    - It's crap.

449
00:45:31,878 --> 00:45:34,118
Girls on dog? Gay sex, man?

450
00:45:34,129 --> 00:45:35,616
Anything you want, you get.

451
00:45:35,631 --> 00:45:37,900
I hook you up, man.

452
00:45:37,925 --> 00:45:39,748
All right, What... what's your name?

453
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,875
- Beckham.    - Beckham like the soccer player?

454
00:45:41,887 --> 00:45:43,968
Yeah, man. It's like soccer player. Now give me my ball.

455
00:45:43,973 --> 00:45:45,212
Are you a soccer player?

456
00:45:45,224 --> 00:45:48,255
Yeah, man, Best of the best. I'm better than Beckham.

457
00:45:48,268 --> 00:45:50,821
- You play goalie?    - Yes, I play goalie    - Good

458
00:45:50,938 --> 00:45:55,492
I'll make you a deal. If you can stop the ball, I'm going to give you five bucks,

459
00:45:55,651 --> 00:45:57,850
- but if you can't...    - And what if... what if I can't?

460
00:45:57,861 --> 00:46:01,210
Listen to me. If I score, I'm going to keep your ball,

461
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,766
- Deal?    - Deal

462
00:46:04,368 --> 00:46:05,441
Get up there

463
00:46:05,452 --> 00:46:08,397
Go on

464
00:46:12,501 --> 00:46:14,594
- Let's see what you got hot stuff    - Are you ready?

465
00:46:14,795 --> 00:46:16,288

00:46:33,231 --> 00:46:34,345
That's right.

473
00:46:34,356 --> 00:46:35,431
It's fun, no?

474
00:46:35,441 --> 00:46:37,226
It's cool? It's gangster.

475
00:46:37,484 --> 00:46:40,771
- Yeah?    - Yeah, I think so.

476
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,982
Tell you what, I'm going to buy...

477
00:46:44,158 --> 00:46:47,628
Let me see if I have enough money, yeah. Five.

478
00:46:48,078 --> 00:46:50,464
I'm going to buy another DVD, okay?

479
00:46:50,914 --> 00:46:55,302
But if it's shaky... Look at me... or out of focus...

480
00:46:55,711 --> 00:46:57,929
or any way not 100%,

00:46:58,213 --> 00:47:01,201
I'm going to chop off your god dammed head with a dull knife.

482
00:47:01,216 --> 00:47:03,685
How do you feel about that? I'm just kidding.

483
00:47:05,304 --> 00:47:08,231
Here, you're a good kid, man. You're a good kid, aren't ya?

484
00:47:09,433 --> 00:47:10,734
Owen

485
00:47:11,894 --> 00:47:12,758
Hi

486
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:14,279
- Hi, sir,    - How are you?

487
00:47:14,897 --> 00:47:16,390
- I'm good    - Good

488
00:47:16,482 --> 00:47:19,242
- What's wrong?    - Brakes are squeaking

489
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,937
Don't trust the mechanics around here. You know.

490
00:47:22,863 --> 00:47:25,374
- So, how you doing?    - Good

491
00:47:25,616 --> 00:47:27,209
I just want to check the oil.

492
00:47:27,743 --> 00:47:30,629
Yeah, it's good to sleep, eating well...

493
00:47:31,163 --> 00:47:33,490
I'm feeling pretty squared away, actually, doc.

494
00:47:33,499 --> 00:47:34,950
Good to hear it.

495
00:47:35,376 --> 00:47:38,303
So, you getting along with the other soldiers in your unit?

496
00:47:39,505 --> 00:47:45,185
Yeah, My team's great. My team Leader is inspiring.

497
00:47:45,552 --> 00:47:48,785
- Are you being sarcastic, soldier?    - No

498
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:50,607
He's going to get me killed.

499
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:52,693
almost died yesterday.

500
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:57,614
At least I'll die in the line of duty, proud and strong.

501
00:47:57,773 --> 00:48:00,200
You know, this doesn't have to be a bad time in your life.

502
00:48:00,484 --> 00:48:03,870
Going to war is a - is a once in a lifetime experience.

503
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:05,314
It could be fun.

504
00:48:05,364 --> 00:48:08,230
And you know this from your extensive work in the field, right?

505
00:48:08,242 --> 00:48:09,960
I've done my field duty.

506
00:48:10,244 --> 00:48:12,129
Where's that? Yale?

507
00:48:13,789 --> 00:48:16,739
Look, you don't want me to come around, I won't come around.

508
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:18,343
These talks are voluntary.

509
00:48:18,669 --> 00:48:20,137
Look, I'm sorry.

510
00:48:20,796 --> 00:48:23,198
I appreciate what you're saying, I do.

511
00:48:23,215 --> 00:48:25,225
I appreciate our sessions together,

512
00:48:26,301 --> 00:48:29,963
but you need to come out from behind the wire, see what we do.

513
00:48:30,431 --> 00:48:31,506
Well,

514
00:48:32,016 --> 00:48:34,128
if this circumstance calls for it, I will.

515
00:48:34,143 --> 00:48:35,986
Just like every other soldier.

516
00:48:42,234 --> 00:48:43,610
Fire in the hole!

517
00:48:43,652 --> 00:48:44,987
Firing now!

518
00:48:51,952 --> 00:48:53,987
- Ready for second det?    - Ready

519
00:48:54,496 --> 00:48:57,895
Fire in the hole! Fire in the hole, Fire in the hole!

520
00:48:57,916 --> 00:48:59,718
Whoa, whoa, whoa, Hold on a second!

521
00:49:00,336 --> 00:49:03,612
God damn it, I think it forgot my gloves down there.

522
00:49:03,630 --> 00:49:05,724
- What?    - I forgot my gloves.

523
00:49:05,841 --> 00:49:06,989
Hang on

524
00:49:41,251 --> 00:49:43,952
You know, these detonators misfire all the time.

525
00:49:45,297 --> 00:49:46,640
What are you doing?

526
00:49:47,424 --> 00:49:49,968
I'm just saying shit happens, they misfire.

527
00:49:52,930 --> 00:49:55,048
He'd be obliterated to nothing,

528
00:49:56,684 --> 00:49:58,860
His helmet would be left, You could have that.

529
00:49:59,103 --> 00:50:01,947
Little specs of hair, charred on the inside.

530
00:50:02,982 --> 00:50:05,158
Yeah, there'd be half a helmet somewhere,

531
00:50:05,901 --> 00:50:07,286
bits of hair.

532
00:50:08,988 --> 00:50:11,687
Ask for a change in technique and protocol,

533
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:14,501
make sure this type of accident never happen again, you know?

534
00:50:17,621 --> 00:50:19,339
You'd have to write the report.

535
00:50:21,792 --> 00:50:24,386
- Are you serious?    - I can't write it.

536
00:50:25,629 --> 00:50:28,265
No, I mean, are you serious about killing him?

537
00:51:07,921 --> 00:51:11,433
- Twelve o'clock I see an SUV    - Roger that

538
00:51:11,508 --> 00:51:13,435
I got four armed men.

539
00:51:13,552 --> 00:51:15,437
They're in Haji gear.

540
00:51:16,847 --> 00:51:18,774
All right, go slow and easy.

541
00:51:26,482 --> 00:51:28,617
Careful now.

542
00:51:31,403 --> 00:51:33,664
All right, Careful now, guys.

543
00:51:33,906 --> 00:51:36,295
- Eldridge, you stay on that 50.    - I got 'em.

544
00:51:36,325 --> 00:51:39,740
''Obre... obre...'' put your gun down!

545
00:51:39,745 --> 00:51:43,575
On your knees! Put your gun down!

546
00:51:43,582 --> 00:51:46,789
- Obre, motherfucker!    - Hold up your hands!

547
00:51:46,794 --> 00:51:49,179
Get down, motherfucker, Obre!

548
00:51:49,421 --> 00:51:51,890
Put your gun down now!

549
00:51:57,346 --> 00:51:59,398
Put your gun down!

550
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:05,153
Advance, advance...

551
00:52:25,082 --> 00:52:26,717
Hands high!

552
00:52:27,334 --> 00:52:29,678
- Eldridge, cover!    - I got you

553
00:52:30,838 --> 00:52:32,973
Pistol, off your hip, now!

554
00:52:33,298 --> 00:52:34,128
What you want me to do?

555
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:36,184
Keep my hands up or take off the pistol?

556
00:52:38,303 --> 00:52:40,397
- Keep your hands up    - Okay

557
00:52:45,519 --> 00:52:47,304
Easy, easy.

558
00:52:47,688 --> 00:52:48,889
Got it!

559
00:52:50,983 --> 00:52:52,868
Can I touch my fucking head now?

560
00:52:54,403 --> 00:52:55,537
Slowly

561
00:53:02,870 --> 00:53:05,505
We're on the same fucking side, guys.

562
00:53:06,582 --> 00:53:07,741
Jesus

563
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:10,414
You guys are wired fucking tight, you know that?

564
00:53:10,419 --> 00:53:13,542
Well, this is no place for a picnic, right. What are you guys doing here?

565
00:53:13,547 --> 00:53:15,377
We have a flat tire, can you help us?

566
00:53:15,382 --> 00:53:17,046
Sure, yeah. You got any spares?

567
00:53:17,051 --> 00:53:19,214
We have spares, but we've used up our wrench.

568
00:53:19,219 --> 00:53:20,612
How do you use up a wrench?

569
00:53:20,637 --> 00:53:23,303
Well, the uh, the guy over there with the red thing on his head,

570
00:53:23,308 --> 00:53:24,591
he threw it at someone.

571
00:53:25,726 --> 00:53:27,319
- All right    - Thank you

572
00:53:31,231 --> 00:53:34,326
That's Chris, this is the wrench man.

573
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,565
- Hello, wrench man.    - That's Jimmy.

574
00:53:36,570 --> 00:53:39,026
You know, you can shoot people here, you don't have to throw a wrench at 'em,

575
00:53:39,031 --> 00:53:40,088
Fuck off

576
00:53:49,833 --> 00:53:51,243
Take a look at this,

577
00:53:51,835 --> 00:53:53,929
I picked these guys up in Najaf.

578
00:53:55,839 --> 00:53:57,599
Nine of hearts, that's one,

579
00:53:58,467 --> 00:54:01,311
And the other... jack of clubs,

580
00:54:06,016 --> 00:54:08,151
- These the same guys?    - Yep, That's them.

581
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:12,890
Does he need a little help there?

582
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:15,409
What's the problem with the tire? Come on.

583
00:54:17,611 --> 00:54:20,187
No good, boss. This wrench is too small.

584
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,735
All right, solutions? Anyone?

585
00:54:21,740 --> 00:54:24,321
I think there's another wrench in the back of the Humvee if you want to check,

586
00:54:24,326 --> 00:54:25,984
- I'll give it a try.    - All right. Let's do it.

587
00:54:27,413 --> 00:54:28,894
How long you guys out here?

588
00:54:29,456 --> 00:54:31,675
Well, I don't know. Specialist, what do we got?

589
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:38,181
- We have... 23 more days or 22... - Oh yeah

590
00:54:38,424 --> 00:54:41,990
No one's counting.

591
00:54:45,139 --> 00:54:47,190
Contact left!

592
00:54:57,318 --> 00:54:58,957
Take cover!

593
00:54:58,986 --> 00:55:01,984
Chris, take the 50. Jimmy, take that in the Humvee.

594
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:03,649
- Got it.    - Come on!

595
00:55:17,818 --> 00:55:18,977
Charlie, go!

596
00:55:20,070 --> 00:55:21,730
Go, go, go!

597
00:55:28,871 --> 00:55:30,033
Fucking morons!

598
00:55:30,038 --> 00:55:33,992
Get on the side, Charlie Get the Barret and the go-bag, Jimmy.

599
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:38,954
- What are we shooting at?    - I don't know.

600
00:55:39,173 --> 00:55:40,795
Fuck, the packages are gone!

601
00:55:40,800 --> 00:55:42,087
They won't get far on foot.

602
00:55:42,092 --> 00:55:45,392
Bring 'em back those fuckers now. I'm out 500,000 fucking pounds.

603
00:55:58,484 --> 00:55:59,585
I forgot,

604
00:55:59,610 --> 00:56:02,104
it's 500,000 dead or alive.

605
00:56:05,574 --> 00:56:08,543
- Okay Jimmy, give me the Barret.    - Yeah

606
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:11,780
I can't see a thing.

607
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:14,825
Come on!

608
00:56:20,214 --> 00:56:22,878
Chris is shooting wild. Gotta conserve the ammo.

609
00:56:22,883 --> 00:56:24,476
Hey, Chris can you hear me?

610
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:29,093
Hey, Chris! Chris! Can you hear me? Chill out on the 50!

611
00:56:29,098 --> 00:56:30,357
Roger that.

612
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:34,986
- Fifty's down    - They shot Chris.

613
00:56:46,031 --> 00:56:47,694
It must be coming from that building.

614
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:49,109
I can't see anything.

615
00:56:53,831 --> 00:56:55,424
Movement on the roof.

616
00:57:09,179 --> 00:57:10,355
Yeah?

617
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:11,882
Three meters higher.

618
00:57:11,932 --> 00:57:16,194
I'm going to adjust.

619
00:57:44,381 --> 00:57:45,707
Fuck

620
00:57:46,091 --> 00:57:48,543
Fuck, he's dead.

621
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:50,287
We've got to get out of here now!

622
00:57:50,304 --> 00:57:50,911
Damm it.

623
00:57:50,929 --> 00:57:52,635
This is Alpha Nine. We're in deep shit.

624
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:53,927
I'll get on the Barret.

625
00:57:53,932 --> 00:57:54,803
Go, go, go!

626
00:57:54,808 --> 00:57:56,513
Yeah, we're taking incoming fire.

627
00:57:56,518 --> 00:57:57,514
Go, go, go!

628
00:57:57,519 --> 00:57:59,641
- No, Sanborn, don't come up here    - Got it!

629
00:57:59,646 --> 00:58:01,435
Go, buddy, Stay low! Stay Low!

630
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:02,683

632
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:08,225
Stay low!

633
00:58:08,238 --> 00:58:09,577
Can you get me some help?

634
00:58:09,583 --> 00:58:11,700
Copy, Alpha Nine. Hold on, over.

635
00:58:11,909 --> 00:58:13,493
- Behind you    - Yeah

636
00:58:30,177 --> 00:58:31,587
Breathe easy

637

- I got movement    - Yeah

638
00:58:35,974 --> 00:58:37,509
On the ridge of that house

639
00:58:41,605 --> 00:58:43,490
Eight hundred and fifty meters

640
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:45,976
- See it    - By the window

641
00:58:46,902 --> 00:58:50,664
- You got target    - Got it

642
00:58:57,162 --> 00:58:59,214
All right, here little left.

643
00:58:59,915 --> 00:59:01,480
Just breathe easy

644
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:12,761
- I'm out of ammo - Hmm?

645
00:59:13,595 --> 00:59:14,717
I'm out of ammo.

646
00:59:14,722 --> 00:59:17,299
Eldridge, we need ammo.

647
00:59:21,645 --> 00:59:22,854
Where is it?

648
00:59:23,522 --> 00:59:25,432
Check on the dead guy, man.

649
00:59:25,482 --> 00:59:26,850
It's on the dead man.

650
00:59:33,115 --> 00:59:34,399
Eldridge!

651
00:59:34,491 --> 00:59:35,796
I'm looking.

652
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,580
We need that ammo, man.

653
00:59:40,622 --> 00:59:41,823
All right, man.

654
00:59:43,417 --> 00:59:44,926
Oh, here.

655
00:59:47,629 --> 00:59:48,956
Thanks

656
01:00:02,144 --> 01:00:03,432
All right. Got it.

657
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:05,238
Same target.

658
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:09,870
It's fucking jammed.

659
01:00:10,402 --> 01:00:11,525
Let me see it.

660
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:14,590
Fuck!

661
01:00:14,782 --> 01:00:19,628
Aw, shit. The blood's making it jam, Eldridge.

662
01:00:19,953 --> 01:00:20,971
Shit!

663
01:00:20,996 --> 01:00:23,203
You gotta clean the blood off, man. It's making 'em jam.

664
01:00:23,208 --> 01:00:24,825
Specialist!

665
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,296
- Clean the blood off.    - Okay

666
01:00:35,469 --> 01:00:36,995
Clean it. Clean it.

667
01:00:37,805 --> 01:00:39,009
You gotta clean it, man.

668
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:40,941
- How?    - Spit and rub,

669
01:00:44,144 --> 01:00:45,220
All right

670
01:00:46,313 --> 01:00:48,699
Spit and rub, buddy. Spit and rub.

671
01:00:51,235 --> 01:00:54,655
It's not working, it's not coming off.

672
01:00:58,867 --> 01:01:02,671
Spit and rub, Spit and rub. Here, take it out.

673
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:06,783
- Use your camel, Use your camel.    -  Where is it?

674
01:01:06,875 --> 01:01:08,996
You all right?

675
01:01:09,169 --> 01:01:10,554
Here, use that.

676
01:01:14,007 --> 01:01:15,379
Just breathe, buddy.

677
01:01:15,384 --> 01:01:16,797
Come on, Just breathe in.

678
01:01:16,927 --> 01:01:19,312
Good. Here, squeeze.

679
01:01:19,763 --> 01:01:21,857
- Got it?    - Yeah

680
01:01:22,725 --> 01:01:25,944
Rub that olive, baby. Come on, you got it.

681
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:37,330
You're doing good, man. You're doing real good.

682
01:01:39,283 --> 01:01:41,168
- Got 'em?    - Yeah

683
01:01:41,994 --> 01:01:43,654
I'm going to keep you safe, buddy, all right?

684
01:01:43,746 --> 01:01:45,697
Now let's get these bastards, Scan your sectors.

685
01:01:45,706 --> 01:01:47,199
Scan your sectors.

686
01:01:54,965 --> 01:01:56,967
Kill that fuckin' asshole.

687
01:01:58,844 --> 01:02:00,295
Son of a bitch.

688
01:02:11,356 --> 01:02:14,706
Nice, he's down. 2nd one out of range.

689
01:02:15,611 --> 01:02:17,696
Twenty meters to the right of the building.

690
01:02:22,910 --> 01:02:24,111
I got him.

691
01:02:26,622 --> 01:02:27,991
Fire when ready.

692
01:02:35,964 --> 01:02:38,417
He's moving, he's moving. To the building.

693
01:02:38,550 --> 01:02:40,919
- Follow him You got him?    - Got him

694
01:02:45,516 --> 01:02:46,717
He's down.

695
01:02:48,769 --> 01:02:51,772
Goodnight. Thanks for playing.

696
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:03,867
Window, the window. At the window,

697
01:03:09,373 --> 01:03:10,716
He's still there.

698
01:03:26,181 --> 01:03:28,767
Left window. Left window, Got him?

699
01:03:28,809 --> 01:03:29,998
Got him.

700
01:03:49,413 --> 01:03:50,786
He's down.

701
01:04:47,471 --> 01:04:50,691
- Hey, Owen?    - Yeah?

702
01:04:51,183 --> 01:04:54,056
Can you grab the juice? out of the pack please?

703
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:54,963
Sure

704
01:05:07,616 --> 01:05:08,997
I think we're out.

705
01:05:10,035 --> 01:05:12,996
- Got anything left to drink?    - You could try that one.

706
01:05:33,517 --> 01:05:34,735
Thank you.

707
01:06:00,878 --> 01:06:03,847
Drink, drink it.

708
01:07:07,403 --> 01:07:09,313
Things are real quiet.

709
01:07:09,488 --> 01:07:12,499
Yeah, I don't like it.

710
01:07:32,219 --> 01:07:35,439
- Hey, Will?    - Yeah?

711
01:07:36,223 --> 01:07:38,216
At your six o'clock.

712
01:07:38,642 --> 01:07:41,990
I see movement on the bridge. Right on the tracks.

713
01:07:43,731 --> 01:07:45,407
Well, handle it.

714
01:07:49,695 --> 01:07:51,413
Should I fire?

715
01:07:52,448 --> 01:07:53,899
It's your call, buddy.

716
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:24,596
Good job.

717
01:08:54,927 --> 01:08:56,436
Hey, Sanborn.

718
01:09:00,766 --> 01:09:02,401
I think we're done.

719
01:09:15,656 --> 01:09:17,499
Okay? You all right?

720
01:09:20,953 --> 01:09:23,380
That's what you get for hitting your fucking team leader, motherfucker.

721
01:09:25,958 --> 01:09:28,410
- Man    - I'll be right back, I gotta piss.

722
01:09:28,961 --> 01:09:32,751
Owen. Another round, boy. That's your order.

723
01:09:32,756 --> 01:09:35,167
Well, yes, sir. Sgt, James, sir.

724
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:36,880
You're not very good with people, are you, sir?

725
01:09:36,885 --> 01:09:38,762
But you're a good warrior, Give me your mug.

726
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:40,794
There ya go, sir.

727
01:09:40,806 --> 01:09:44,051
You were well on the field of battle today, specialist.

728
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:45,794
Cheers

729
01:09:53,610 --> 01:09:55,479
Uh, I'm too old for this shit.

730
01:10:00,743 --> 01:10:03,754
- I was scared.    - Yeah?

731
01:10:04,079 --> 01:10:07,549
Well, everyone's a coward about something, you know.

732
01:10:10,044 --> 01:10:12,666
You're good. You're real good.

733
01:10:12,671 --> 01:10:14,706
Just what do we have here?

734
01:10:15,382 --> 01:10:18,252
Will has possessions.

735
01:10:19,178 --> 01:10:21,133
I didn't know you owned anything, Will.

736
01:10:21,138 --> 01:10:22,965
Let's see what you got here, Will.

737
01:10:25,350 --> 01:10:26,490
Who is that?

738
01:10:26,518 --> 01:10:27,993
That's my son,

739
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:32,978
he's a tough little bastard, nothing like me.

740
01:10:32,983 --> 01:10:35,102
You mean to tell me you married?

741
01:10:36,945 --> 01:10:40,486
Well, you know, I had a girlfriend and...

742
01:10:40,491 --> 01:10:43,692
she got pregnant, so we got married.

743
01:10:44,328 --> 01:10:45,821
We got divorced.

744
01:10:48,290 --> 01:10:50,287
Or I thought we got divorced.

745
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:53,707
She's still living in the house. And she says we're still together,

746
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:57,541
so I don't know, What does that make her?

747
01:10:57,633 --> 01:11:02,295
Dumb for still being with your ass.

748
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:04,051
Hey

749
01:11:04,056 --> 01:11:05,716
She ain't fuckin' dumb, all right?

750
01:11:05,808 --> 01:11:07,259
She's just loyal.

751
01:11:08,852 --> 01:11:11,680
She's just loyal. That's all, How 'bout you guys?

752
01:11:12,523 --> 01:11:16,018
You got... you got a girl? What do you got?

753
01:11:16,235 --> 01:11:19,896
My only problem is the girl I do like,

754
01:11:20,447 --> 01:11:23,111
I can't stop her from talking about babies, man.

755
01:11:23,158 --> 01:11:25,419
Well, give her your sperm, stud.

756
01:11:26,120 --> 01:11:27,696
Go on. Do it.

757
01:11:27,913 --> 01:11:30,162
- C'mon, chicken. Just give it to her.    - No! Hell no!

758
01:11:30,167 --> 01:11:31,245
Make babies

759
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:34,952
I know when I'm ready, and I ain't ready for that yet, I know that.

760
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:39,166
Well, well... what do we have here?

761
01:11:40,509 --> 01:11:42,169
Uh, components.

762
01:11:43,262 --> 01:11:45,592
They're bomb parts, signatures.

763
01:11:45,597 --> 01:11:47,883
Yeah, I see that, but what they doing under your bed?

764
01:11:50,561 --> 01:11:51,992
Well...

765
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:01,396
Ah-ha, there we go, this one...

766
01:12:01,989 --> 01:12:05,738
This one is from the UN building.

767
01:12:05,743 --> 01:12:09,655
Flaming car, dead man's switch... Boom,

768
01:12:09,788 --> 01:12:11,590
This guy was great, I like him.

769
01:12:12,833 --> 01:12:14,910
Ah... Look at this one.

770
01:12:15,544 --> 01:12:19,998
This one, y'all, is from our first call together.

771
01:12:21,216 --> 01:12:25,354
This box is full of stuff that almost killed me.

772
01:12:25,763 --> 01:12:27,172
And what about this one?

773
01:12:27,222 --> 01:12:29,649
- Where's this one from, Will?    - It's my wedding ring.

774
01:12:30,225 --> 01:12:32,569
Like I said, stuff that almost killed me.

775
01:12:33,771 --> 01:12:38,305
You know, I just think it's really interesting

776
01:12:38,317 --> 01:12:39,768
to hold something in your hand that could have killed anyone.

777
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:43,622
Damn that, It's all shit from radio shack.

778
01:12:45,949 --> 01:12:47,417
It's interesting.

779
01:12:47,868 --> 01:12:49,406
I think it's interesting too.

780
01:12:49,411 --> 01:12:51,160
Well, I think you hit me harder than I hit you

781
01:12:51,165 --> 01:12:54,370
therefore I owe you a punch.

782
01:12:54,375 --> 01:12:56,296
Now get your ass up, C'mon.

783
01:12:56,418 --> 01:12:59,538
C'mon, He's right. Let's go, C'mon,

784
01:13:00,923 --> 01:13:01,995
Come on!

785
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:04,001
All right, hold on, boys. We need some rules,

786
01:13:04,051 --> 01:13:05,881
Sanborn, no face shots.

787
01:13:05,886 --> 01:13:06,945
Oh, there's gonna be a face shot.

788
01:13:06,970 --> 01:13:08,605
Sergeant James, take off your shirt.

789
01:13:09,223 --> 01:13:10,732
Yes, sir.

790
01:13:11,058 --> 01:13:12,251
What happened?

791
01:13:12,393 --> 01:13:14,569
My momma dropped me when I was a baby,

792
01:13:15,187 --> 01:13:16,392
Looks like frag scars,

793
01:13:16,397 --> 01:13:20,684
- Let it go, Eldridge, C'mon,    - All right,

794
01:13:20,818 --> 01:13:22,577
Nice and big

795
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:28,692
Oohh!

796
01:13:36,291 --> 01:13:37,496
You like that, huh?

797
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:39,328
That's all you got?

798
01:13:39,712 --> 01:13:41,079
Come on,

799
01:13:43,716 --> 01:13:45,600
Bring some, C'mon,

800
01:13:47,094 --> 01:13:48,503
Ooh!

801
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:54,990
Wooh, God damn!

802
01:13:55,269 --> 01:13:56,970
That's gotta hurt.

803
01:14:00,441 --> 01:14:02,142
- You all right, man?    - Oh, yeah

804
01:14:03,944 --> 01:14:06,163
- Oh, he's all right.    - Get up, bitch.

805
01:14:08,115 --> 01:14:09,624
All right, bitch.

806
01:14:12,619 --> 01:14:14,408
- What do you got now?    - Get the fuck off me?

807
01:14:14,413 --> 01:14:16,077
- What do you got?    - Get off me, you mother fucker.

808
01:14:16,082 --> 01:14:17,996
What do you got? What do you got?

809
01:14:18,001 --> 01:14:21,123
Wooh, he's a wild one. We got a wild one.

810
01:14:21,128 --> 01:14:23,208
C'mon, Sanborn. Get him. That's right.

811
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:26,962
- Ride him, baby.    - Get off me

812
01:14:26,967 --> 01:14:28,672
- C'mon, bitch    - C'mon, guys

813
01:14:28,677 --> 01:14:30,629
What do you got?

814
01:14:30,721 --> 01:14:32,297
Get off me

815
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:33,774
Hey, hey, hey!

816
01:14:44,735 --> 01:14:46,937
I'm just kidding, motherfucker, shit!

817
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:50,691
You're all right, Sanborn.

818
01:14:50,783 --> 01:14:51,737
You're all right, man.

819
01:14:51,742 --> 01:14:54,252
Owen, get this guy a drink. C'mon.

820
01:14:55,788 --> 01:14:57,242
- You got him?    - Yeah, I got him,

821
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:58,660
- All right, here.    - All right.

822
01:14:58,665 --> 01:15:00,537
- See you later, be safe.    - All right.

823
01:15:00,542 --> 01:15:03,997
All right, come on big boy. Damn, boy, you need to get on a diet.

824
01:15:04,254 --> 01:15:06,665
He hurt his knee,. C'mon, man.

825
01:15:07,883 --> 01:15:11,086
Steps. C'mon.

826
01:15:12,554 --> 01:15:14,840
Step, step.

827
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:24,766
All right, lay down. All right, Get some rest.

828
01:15:25,484 --> 01:15:30,397
Hey, James, you think I got what it takes to put on the suit?

829
01:15:32,741 --> 01:15:34,067
Hell, no.

830
01:15:35,577 --> 01:15:37,237
Night, boy.

831
01:16:31,175 --> 01:16:32,125
Oh!

832
01:16:36,388 --> 01:16:38,340
- Good morning, Colonel.    - Good morning.

833
01:16:38,849 --> 01:16:43,445
Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death of sitting behind a desk all the time.

834
01:16:46,106 --> 01:16:48,450
- That'd be a privilege.    - Hop in, Colonel.

835
01:16:52,571 --> 01:16:53,997
Hey, Doc.

836
01:16:54,573 --> 01:16:56,278
Not to insult your intelligence, sir.

837
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:59,583
but if the shit hits the fan, please don't fire out the Humvee.

838
01:16:59,620 --> 01:17:02,714
The round will just bounce around, and someone might get shot.

839
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:06,343
- I don't like getting shot.    - Understood, Sergeant,

840
01:17:19,014 --> 01:17:20,135
Oh, it's a pretty standard mission.

841
01:17:20,140 --> 01:17:22,526
We're just here to pick up some unexploded ordinance.

842
01:17:22,851 --> 01:17:25,862
Sergeant James is gonna see what the deal is

843
01:17:26,146 --> 01:17:28,532
and then hopefully we'll be gone in a couple minutes.

844
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:30,605
- We've gotta gear up.    - For what?

845
01:17:30,610 --> 01:17:32,094
Security hasn't gone in.

846
01:17:32,152 --> 01:17:33,649
Go in quiet.

847
01:17:33,654 --> 01:17:35,792
- Radios off, Roger    - Roger that

848
01:17:36,240 --> 01:17:38,583
- Glad you came.    - Stay safe, all right

849
01:20:42,843 --> 01:20:44,269
Clear

850
01:20:45,179 --> 01:20:46,213
Hey

851
01:20:46,346 --> 01:20:48,357
cigarette's still smoking.

852
01:20:52,061 --> 01:20:53,570
It's all our shit.

853
01:20:56,899 --> 01:20:58,909
Mother fucking goldmine.

854
01:21:00,527 --> 01:21:02,165
Watch out for trips

855
01:21:26,178 --> 01:21:27,604
I got something

856
01:21:40,776 --> 01:21:42,369
I know this kid

857
01:21:43,320 --> 01:21:45,747
His name's Beckham. He sells DVDs,

858
01:21:46,365 --> 01:21:48,542
You ever see a body bomb before, man?

859
01:21:50,994 --> 01:21:53,630
It's disgusting. Let's get outta here,

860
01:21:53,997 --> 01:21:55,145
Hold it.

861
01:21:56,417 --> 01:22:01,763
Eldridge, want you to grab all the C4 and deck cord you can get your hands on.

862
01:22:04,591 --> 01:22:06,463
Let's get all this ordnance outta here.

863
01:22:06,468 --> 01:22:08,812
And we're just gonna... we're gonna blow the place.

864
01:22:09,763 --> 01:22:11,481
Roger, Just blow it.

865
01:22:20,023 --> 01:22:21,253
What are you doing?

866
01:22:22,526 --> 01:22:24,992
Yeah? Putting the stones in to move.

867
01:22:26,447 --> 01:22:27,814
Yeah, that's really wonderful

868
01:22:28,490 --> 01:22:30,192
but it's a little bit unsafe today,

869
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:34,116
Yeah, it's a little unsafe.

870
01:22:34,121 --> 01:22:35,739
So maybe... I don't know.

871
01:22:35,831 --> 01:22:39,264
I'm thinking maybe we should move?

872
01:22:39,293 --> 01:22:40,369
No?

873
01:22:57,186 --> 01:22:58,470
Fuck

874
01:23:03,275 --> 01:23:04,396
- You all right?    - Yeah

875
01:23:04,401 --> 01:23:05,852
- You?    - Yeah

876
01:23:11,742 --> 01:23:14,069
- You all right, man?    - Yeah

877
01:23:15,079 --> 01:23:16,630
No one in or out, okay?

878
01:23:58,872 --> 01:24:00,841
Cancel the det, Cancel the det.

879
01:24:22,771 --> 01:24:25,282
- What the fuck is he doing?    - I don't know, man.

880
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:28,535
I don't know.

881
01:25:56,907 --> 01:25:58,250
I'm coming out.

882
01:25:59,076 --> 01:26:00,444
Roger that.

883
01:26:20,806 --> 01:26:22,841
- Where are you from?    - New York.

884
01:26:22,975 --> 01:26:24,343
The Big Apple.

885
01:26:24,852 --> 01:26:26,428
I'm from Iraq

886
01:26:26,437 --> 01:26:28,600
I love it here. This is a beautiful place.

887
01:26:28,605 --> 01:26:31,019
But it's not too safe here, okay?

888
01:26:31,024 --> 01:26:34,995
So, I think we need - we need to move, please.

889
01:26:58,969 --> 01:27:00,671
You think it's that little Beckham?

890
01:27:00,763 --> 01:27:02,481
No, I don't.

891
01:27:02,723 --> 01:27:05,359
- You're positive?    - Sure.

892
01:27:05,726 --> 01:27:08,320
Hey, I don't know, man. They all look the same, right?

893
01:27:08,687 --> 01:27:09,641
I don't know.

894
01:27:09,646 --> 01:27:13,325
- Will seemed sure. That was weird.    - Very weird.

895
01:27:15,402 --> 01:27:18,063
Please, just move.

896
01:27:18,197 --> 01:27:20,611
Move, Move.

897
01:27:20,616 --> 01:27:25,404
Move on. Thank you.

898
01:27:28,624 --> 01:27:29,908
I'm sorry.

899
01:27:30,501 --> 01:27:31,997
Will's very weird.

900
01:27:32,419 --> 01:27:34,611
I mean he keeps bomb parts under his bed.

901
01:27:34,630 --> 01:27:37,821
I'll bet you he won't keep any of these parts under his bed.

902
01:27:39,718 --> 01:27:40,919
Bye-bye

903
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:45,173
Yeah, bye-bye. Bye, thank you.

904
01:27:45,891 --> 01:27:47,217
Hey, Colonel

905
01:27:47,851 --> 01:27:48,722
Let's go

906
01:27:48,727 --> 01:27:51,346
So long, thank you.

907
01:27:58,404 --> 01:27:59,980
IED!

908
01:28:01,407 --> 01:28:02,649
Cambridge!

909
01:28:07,371 --> 01:28:08,909
Get back, get down

910
01:28:08,914 --> 01:28:10,494
Stay back

911
01:28:10,499 --> 01:28:12,801
Stay back, Sanborn, keep 'em back

912
01:28:13,293 --> 01:28:14,164
Is anyone hurt?

913
01:28:14,169 --> 01:28:16,997
Cambridge! Fuck!

914
01:28:17,589 --> 01:28:19,349
Where's Cambridge!

915
01:28:20,050 --> 01:28:21,797
Cambridge, come out, We gotta go.

916
01:28:21,802 --> 01:28:23,086
Oh, he's dead.

917
01:28:23,762 --> 01:28:26,486
Hey, we gotta find Cambridge, Doc!

918
01:28:26,515 --> 01:28:29,287
- Eldridge!    - Doc!

919
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:32,641
Eldridge, c'mon, man, C'mon

920
01:28:32,646 --> 01:28:34,727
I just saw him. He was walking right here.

921
01:28:34,732 --> 01:28:38,285
I know. He's dead. Look, he's dead, Okay?

922
01:28:51,999 --> 01:28:53,328
It's all right, man.

923
01:28:53,333 --> 01:28:55,577
It'll be all right, man,.

924
01:29:19,068 --> 01:29:20,227
Hello?

925
01:29:22,237 --> 01:29:23,522
Hello?

926
01:29:24,239 --> 01:29:25,607
Will?

927
01:29:27,576 --> 01:29:28,735
Hello?

928
01:29:31,789 --> 01:29:33,490
Hello?

929
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:26,543
Hey, let me ask you a question,

930
01:30:26,635 --> 01:30:29,383
What happened to the little kid? that used to work here?

931
01:30:29,388 --> 01:30:32,970
Sorry, man, English I... no English.

932
01:30:32,975 --> 01:30:36,306
No-no English, You no speak English now.

933
01:30:36,311 --> 01:30:39,560
Little kid, Beckham is his name. He sells... sells DVDs,

934
01:30:39,565 --> 01:30:42,396
DVD, One DVD, $5,

935
01:30:42,401 --> 01:30:43,936
Oh, Jesus Christ.

936
01:30:44,027 --> 01:30:45,771
- $5    - Excuse me, soldier.

937
01:30:45,863 --> 01:30:47,151
you in charge of this area here?

938
01:30:47,156 --> 01:30:49,333
- What's up?    - You know this guy?

939
01:30:50,117 --> 01:30:52,489
How do we know that he's not giving intel to insurgents

940
01:30:52,494 --> 01:30:54,158
, telling them where to drop mortars?

941
01:30:54,163 --> 01:30:55,659
I think he's just selling DVDs.

942
01:30:55,664 --> 01:30:57,549
Well, he's a security risk, We should get rid of him.

943
01:30:58,125 --> 01:30:59,288
What are you looking at?

944
01:30:59,293 --> 01:31:02,750
- He's just selling DVDs, man. All the merchants are clear.    - By who?

945
01:31:02,755 --> 01:31:05,265
I couldn't do anything with him without the say-so from my CO.

946
01:31:07,843 --> 01:31:09,086
Okay, Fuck

947
01:31:10,471 --> 01:31:12,214
Fuck

948
01:31:48,050 --> 01:31:49,626
Does this change anything?

949
01:31:50,677 --> 01:31:52,087
You speak English now. Don't you?

950
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:54,798
- Yalla, yalla, drive!    - Okay

951
01:32:16,495 --> 01:32:18,530
- OK    - Is this his house?

952
01:32:18,789 --> 01:32:20,282
Beckham's house?

953
01:32:28,924 --> 01:32:30,000
Wait here

954
01:32:39,810 --> 01:32:41,011
Fuck

955
01:33:39,828 --> 01:33:41,780
Psst, psst, shh.

956
01:33:42,748 --> 01:33:44,116
You speak English?

957
01:33:44,166 --> 01:33:45,996
English, French, Arabic.

958
01:33:46,001 --> 01:33:47,327
Good, Open you vest.

959
01:33:48,545 --> 01:33:50,581
Ah, stay there. Stay.

960
01:33:51,131 --> 01:33:52,891
Tell me what you know about Beckham.

961
01:33:53,092 --> 01:33:54,245
For whom?

962
01:33:54,259 --> 01:33:57,813
Beckham, 12-year-old boy, body bomb. Stay right there

963
01:33:58,222 --> 01:34:00,344
- I don't know    - You don't know

964
01:34:00,349 --> 01:34:03,802
But please, sit down. I am Professor Navid,

965
01:34:03,977 --> 01:34:05,470
This is my home.

966
01:34:05,854 --> 01:34:09,141
You are a guest. Please, sit down.

967
01:34:11,527 --> 01:34:13,186
I'm a guest?

968
01:34:15,239 --> 01:34:19,610
Just... I'm looking for the people responsible

969
01:34:20,828 --> 01:34:22,779
for-for-for Beckham,

970
01:34:23,163 --> 01:34:25,616
You are CIA, no?

971
01:34:26,709 --> 01:34:29,244
I am very pleased to see CIA in my home.

972
01:34:29,753 --> 01:34:31,705
Please, sit.

973
01:34:38,971 --> 01:34:40,505
How can I...

974
01:34:44,893 --> 01:34:46,595
Be careful, the gun can go off.

975
01:35:43,702 --> 01:35:45,449
USA friendly coming in.

976
01:35:45,454 --> 01:35:48,286
Stop! Stop! Get the fuck down!

977
01:35:48,291 --> 01:35:49,787
USA friendly,.

978
01:35:49,792 --> 01:35:52,331
On your knees, Get on your knees now.

979
01:35:52,336 --> 01:35:56,502
On your knees. You will be shot. Don't move.

980
01:35:56,507 --> 01:35:58,253
On your knees. Down now.

981
01:35:58,258 --> 01:36:01,882
- Open your jacket!    - Opening my jacket,

982
01:36:01,887 --> 01:36:03,852
Cover. Get him down,

983
01:36:03,889 --> 01:36:05,282
- On the ground,    - I have a weapon

984
01:36:05,307 --> 01:36:07,175
Don't fucking move

985
01:36:07,393 --> 01:36:09,403
- Tower, hold cover. Searching.    - I have a weapon.

986
01:36:10,979 --> 01:36:12,781
- Gun.    - Like I said,.

987
01:36:13,857 --> 01:36:15,309
Weapons clear.

988
01:36:15,442 --> 01:36:16,602
ID

989
01:36:17,194 --> 01:36:18,687
What the fuck are you doing?

990
01:36:18,737 --> 01:36:20,314
I was at a whorehouse.

991
01:36:20,948 --> 01:36:26,028
All right, If I let you in, will you tell me where it is exactly?

992
01:36:27,871 --> 01:36:28,780
Yeah

993
01:36:30,916 --> 01:36:33,160
James, do you copy?

994
01:36:42,511 --> 01:36:44,438
James, do you have your ears on?

995
01:36:47,975 --> 01:36:49,009
James?

996
01:36:50,894 --> 01:36:52,471
This is James, What's up?

997
01:37:08,078 --> 01:37:10,405
- Hey    - What's up, man?

998
01:37:13,208 --> 01:37:15,497
Look, we have a tank explosion in the Green Zone.

999
01:37:15,502 --> 01:37:17,249
We have to post-blast assessment,

1000
01:37:17,254 --> 01:37:18,709
see if it was a suicide bomber,

1001
01:37:18,714 --> 01:37:20,557
and if so, how the fuck did he do it?

1002
01:37:21,341 --> 01:37:22,292
Okay.

1003
01:37:22,885 --> 01:37:24,336
Where'd you say you were again?

1004
01:37:24,762 --> 01:37:26,271
I didn't, sergeant. Let's go.

1005
01:37:28,599 --> 01:37:30,442
What happened to your head, James?

1006
01:37:37,733 --> 01:37:39,117
Hey, you ready?

1007
01:37:39,651 --> 01:37:41,103
Game face, buddy. Let's go.

1008
01:37:46,742 --> 01:37:48,739
- You ready?    - Let's do this.

1009
01:37:48,744 --> 01:37:50,862
Rock and roll. Moving out.

1010
01:38:04,343 --> 01:38:06,461
USA friendlies coming through.

1011
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:28,834
Make room, guys. Make room.

1012
01:38:41,171 --> 01:38:43,382
Hey, Sanborn.

1013
01:38:43,966 --> 01:38:45,125
Oh, shit!

1014
01:38:50,013 --> 01:38:52,583
Get a medic! Get a medic!

1015
01:39:11,660 --> 01:39:13,420
- An oil tanker?    - Yep,

1016
01:39:16,707 --> 01:39:18,325
That's a pretty long flight, huh?

1017
01:41:25,919 --> 01:41:27,996
This is the edge of the blast radius.

1018
01:41:33,886 --> 01:41:35,462
Jesus.

1019
01:41:36,430 --> 01:41:37,923
So, where's our triggerman?

1020
01:41:38,015 --> 01:41:39,841
Burnt up in the flames, man.

1021
01:41:40,184 --> 01:41:41,843
Suicide bomber.

1022
01:41:42,144 --> 01:41:44,503
We're never going to find a body in that shit.

1023
01:41:44,521 --> 01:41:46,139
What if there was no body?

1024
01:41:47,733 --> 01:41:49,351
What if it was a remote det?

1025
01:41:53,989 --> 01:41:56,708
A really good bad guy hides out in the dark, right?

1026
01:41:59,578 --> 01:42:03,590
Right here. Perfect vantage point,

1027
01:42:03,874 --> 01:42:08,303
outside the blast radius to sit back and watch us clean up their mess.

1028
01:42:10,798 --> 01:42:12,849
- Want to go out there?    - Yes, I do

1029
01:42:15,094 --> 01:42:19,298
- I could stand to get in a little trouble.    - No, man. This is bullshit.

1030
01:42:19,390 --> 01:42:23,972
You got three infantry platoons behind you whose job it is to go Haji huntin'.

1031
01:42:23,977 --> 01:42:25,183
That ain't our fuckin' job.

1032
01:42:25,188 --> 01:42:28,018
You don't say no to me, Sanborn. I say no to you.

1033
01:42:28,023 --> 01:42:30,187
You know there are guys watching us right now.

1034
01:42:30,192 --> 01:42:33,787
They're laughing at this, Okay, I'm not okay with that.

1035
01:42:34,405 --> 01:42:37,457
Now, turn off your god dammed torch 'cause we're going.

1036
01:43:46,643 --> 01:43:48,515
Now we know where their oil tanker came from.

1037
01:43:48,520 --> 01:43:50,184
No shit. Same kind.

1038
01:43:50,189 --> 01:43:52,015
- We're close    - Yeah

1039
01:43:52,107 --> 01:43:53,979
The alley ways are probably set up on a grid.

1040
01:43:53,984 --> 01:43:56,762
We're going to need to spit up, flush 'em out.

1041
01:43:57,154 --> 01:43:59,651
Sanborn, you take one, Eldridge, take two,

1042
01:43:59,656 --> 01:44:02,655
I got three. Rally point at your intersection.

1043
01:44:02,660 --> 01:44:04,336
- Ready, move    - Wait, rally point when?

1044
01:44:05,287 --> 01:44:06,238
Fuck

1045
01:44:32,773 --> 01:44:34,449
''Ipsura, ipsura,'' Go, go!

1046
01:45:19,903 --> 01:45:21,980
Shit, Ahh.

1047
01:45:28,328 --> 01:45:29,241
Shit

1048
01:45:29,246 --> 01:45:31,535
- You got contact?    - Who was it? What's going on?

1049
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:33,533
- What do you got?    - It's Eldridge.

1050
01:45:34,877 --> 01:45:35,998
Go, go.

1051
01:45:36,003 --> 01:45:37,763
Man down! Man down!

1052
01:45:38,756 --> 01:45:40,374
Shit, Shit, Shit!

1053
01:45:40,466 --> 01:45:43,560
- Negative, negative. It's not him.    - He's gone.

1054
01:45:43,719 --> 01:45:45,007
Where'd they go? Where'd they go?

1055
01:45:45,012 --> 01:45:47,130
Tankers and troops are that way.

1056
01:45:47,222 --> 01:45:48,924
- Let's go this way.    - Fuck

1057
01:46:11,663 --> 01:46:14,074
Use your torch, On three.

1058
01:46:16,043 --> 01:46:17,202
Ready?

1059
01:46:17,753 --> 01:46:20,330
One, two, three.

1060
01:46:22,466 --> 01:46:23,975
- Fuck!    - Shit

1061
01:46:29,473 --> 01:46:31,441
Softy, softy, softy.

1062
01:46:42,486 --> 01:46:43,582
On three

1063
01:46:43,737 --> 01:46:45,792
One, Two, Three

1064
01:46:49,868 --> 01:46:51,920
Now! Go, go, go...

1065
01:46:54,289 --> 01:46:57,247
- Eldridge, you okay?    - Fuck, dude, I'm hit.

1066
01:46:57,252 --> 01:46:59,206
Hit him in the fuckin' leg.

1067
01:46:59,211 --> 01:47:01,208
Come on

1068
01:47:01,213 --> 01:47:04,975
- Am I dead? Am I dead?    - No, You're fine, man.

1069
01:47:05,175 --> 01:47:07,227
Am I dead? Am I dead?

1070
01:47:08,554 --> 01:47:10,689
I'm going to put some pressure down. Come on.

1071
01:47:10,806 --> 01:47:12,232
You're all right.

1072
01:47:13,100 --> 01:47:15,550
Look at me, look at me, You all right.

1073
01:47:15,644 --> 01:47:20,198
All right, buddy. You ready to get up? On three, ready? One, two, three

1074
01:48:42,564 --> 01:48:45,976
Hey, what's up, man? What's up, man?

1075
01:48:45,984 --> 01:48:48,245
Wanna buy some DVDs? Wanna play some soccer?

1076
01:48:49,488 --> 01:48:50,656
What's up?

1077
01:48:51,198 --> 01:48:52,699
Come on, man. Wanna play some...

1078
01:49:10,134 --> 01:49:12,394
Aww, Fuck.

1079
01:49:17,558 --> 01:49:18,817
How you doing, buddy?

1080
01:49:19,226 --> 01:49:21,011
Doc says you're going to be okay.

1081
01:49:21,145 --> 01:49:23,947
My fucking femur is shattered in nine places.

1082
01:49:24,857 --> 01:49:27,938
He said I'll be walking in six months if I'm fucking lucky.

1083
01:49:27,943 --> 01:49:30,579
- Six months ain't bad, huh?    - It's not bad?

1084
01:49:30,612 --> 01:49:32,443
Fuckin' sucks, man,

1085
01:49:32,448 --> 01:49:34,459
- Ah, ah! Take it easy,

1086
01:49:36,285 --> 01:49:39,349
You see that? You fuckin' see that?

1087
01:49:39,830 --> 01:49:42,966
That's what happens when you shoot someone, you motherfucker.

1088
01:49:43,208 --> 01:49:44,618
Sorry

1089
01:49:45,002 --> 01:49:47,287
- Sorry, Owen.    - Fuck you, Will.

1090
01:49:47,504 --> 01:49:49,039
Really, Fuck you.

1091
01:49:49,882 --> 01:49:53,797
Thanks for saving my life, but we didn't have to go out.

1092
01:49:53,802 --> 01:49:56,938
Looking for trouble to get your fucking adrenaline fix, you fuck.

1093
01:49:58,724 --> 01:50:00,554
Hey, take care of yourself, Owen.

1094
01:50:00,559 --> 01:50:02,181
Come home safe, man.

1095
01:50:02,186 --> 01:50:04,346
- See you on the other side, man.    - All right

1096
01:50:05,314 --> 01:50:07,574
Let's get out of this fucking desert!

1097
01:50:13,447 --> 01:50:14,526
Don't move

1098
01:50:14,531 --> 01:50:17,654
If you keep walking we will shoot you.

1099
01:50:17,659 --> 01:50:19,570
Move him back

1100
01:50:20,371 --> 01:50:21,950
Keep that translator back

1101
01:50:21,955 --> 01:50:23,994
- But the bomb was forced on him.    - Get him back!

1102
01:50:23,999 --> 01:50:26,015
Don't move! Stay still

1103
01:50:28,087 --> 01:50:32,336
If you keep walking we will shoot you. If you keep walking we will shoot.

1104
01:50:32,341 --> 01:50:34,084
Get that translator back, now!

1105
01:50:37,846 --> 01:50:42,050
Give him room, give him room.

1106
01:50:49,233 --> 01:50:50,854
Hey, what do you got?

1107
01:50:50,859 --> 01:50:52,398
He came walking up to our checkpoint,

1108
01:50:52,403 --> 01:50:55,234
said he had a bomb strapped to him, But he's sorry, doesn't want it to go off.

1109
01:50:55,239 --> 01:50:57,399
Then he starts begging us to take it off of him.

1110
01:50:57,533 --> 01:50:59,154
Help this man, he's not a bad man.

1111
01:50:59,159 --> 01:51:01,997
He's not a bad man? He got a bomb strapped to him,

1112
01:51:02,663 --> 01:51:04,619
This is a joke, he's trying to pull us closer.

1113
01:51:04,624 --> 01:51:06,116
Yeah, I got it, I got it.

1114
01:51:06,208 --> 01:51:10,679
All right, look... Tell him to open his shirt slowly

1115
01:51:10,879 --> 01:51:13,265
and see what's inside.

1116
01:51:16,343 --> 01:51:18,762
Slowly, slowly...

1117
01:51:29,273 --> 01:51:30,899
Jesus

1118
01:51:31,984 --> 01:51:34,356
All right Sergeant, I need a 75-meter perimeter.

1119
01:51:34,361 --> 01:51:36,872
- Get these guys back.    - Give me 75 meters. Get back.

1120
01:51:38,323 --> 01:51:41,293
You tell him to get on his knees and touch the sky, okay?

1121
01:51:42,036 --> 01:51:43,287
Slowly

1122
01:51:43,996 --> 01:51:44,998
Get down

1123
01:51:49,293 --> 01:51:51,295
Okay, I need your radio.

1124
01:51:51,420 --> 01:51:53,417
- Can't we just shoot him?    - No

1125
01:51:53,422 --> 01:51:55,461
He's a family man. He's not a bad man.

1126
01:51:55,466 --> 01:51:57,296
He's asking for help, only help.

1127
01:51:57,301 --> 01:52:02,105
Yeah, all right. You don't want to die, get back! I got it.

1128
01:52:05,309 --> 01:52:08,136
Listen, I know we've had our differences.

1129
01:52:08,145 --> 01:52:12,532
It happened, all right. It's water under the bridge.

1130
01:52:13,776 --> 01:52:15,952
This is suicide, man.

1131
01:52:17,237 --> 01:52:19,289
That's why they call it a suicide bomb, right?

1132
01:52:23,077 --> 01:52:24,239
Let's do this. Come on.

1133
01:52:24,244 --> 01:52:26,630
He says the bomb may have a timer, please hurry.

1134
01:52:27,456 --> 01:52:29,408
- We're good, Ready?    - Yep

1135
01:52:34,922 --> 01:52:35,886
Go get 'em

1136
01:52:35,964 --> 01:52:37,117
- Let's do it    - See you

1137
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:38,350
- Watch the snipper huh!    - Yeah!

1138
01:52:49,561 --> 01:52:51,722
Get your hands up

1139
01:52:54,692 --> 01:52:56,184
He says he has a family

1140
01:52:57,569 --> 01:52:58,896
Please help him,

1141
01:53:04,785 --> 01:53:06,782
Now, listen

1142
01:53:06,787 --> 01:53:09,910
Look, It'd be a lot easier for me to disarm this

1143
01:53:09,915 --> 01:53:11,959
if I just shoot you. Do you understand?

1144
01:53:16,380 --> 01:53:17,668
What's he saying?

1145
01:53:17,673 --> 01:53:21,852
He says I don't wish to die, I have a family... Please take this off me.

1146
01:53:22,428 --> 01:53:27,149
Tell him to put his hands behind his head or I'll be very happy to shoot him.

1147
01:53:32,896 --> 01:53:34,393
Look, that's not what I said.

1148
01:53:34,398 --> 01:53:38,118
Tell him to put his hands behind his head or I will shoot him.

1149
01:53:40,696 --> 01:53:41,772
Listen

1150
01:53:44,116 --> 01:53:45,275
Listen, listen.

1151
01:53:46,535 --> 01:53:50,405
You understand?

1152
01:53:52,583 --> 01:53:53,575
Okay

1153
01:53:57,046 --> 01:53:58,288
What do you got here?

1154
01:53:59,757 --> 01:54:01,333
He has four children.

1155
01:54:06,513 --> 01:54:07,839
Shit

1156
01:54:12,394 --> 01:54:15,852
Sanborn, we got a timer, and we got a lot of wires, man.

1157
01:54:15,857 --> 01:54:18,020
I'm going to need a little help on this.

1158
01:54:18,025 --> 01:54:19,826
Roger that, tell me what you need.

1159
01:54:20,069 --> 01:54:21,378
Bolt cutters

1160
01:54:21,403 --> 01:54:23,942
You gotta get down here in two minutes or we're all fucked.

1161
01:54:23,947 --> 01:54:25,649
Roger that, I'll be there in 30 seconds.

1162
01:54:29,495 --> 01:54:31,780
He says, please, I have a family.

1163
01:54:34,375 --> 01:54:35,245
Sst

1164
01:54:35,250 --> 01:54:39,438
I know, it's okay. You're all right. You're all right.

1165
01:54:43,801 --> 01:54:45,210
Please, don't leave me.

1166
01:54:50,516 --> 01:54:52,092
You weren't fuckin' kidding.

1167
01:54:52,351 --> 01:54:55,053
Nope, What's this made out of?

1168
01:55:00,693 --> 01:55:01,752
Oh, man

1169
01:55:01,777 --> 01:55:03,829
This case's harder than steel

1170
01:55:05,197 --> 01:55:06,485
Shit

1171
01:55:06,490 --> 01:55:08,994
- What's our time?    - We got two minutes    - Shit

1172
01:55:09,159 --> 01:55:11,657
We're going need a torch to get this off.

1173
01:55:11,662 --> 01:55:13,701
Well, we don't have one of those in the fucking truck, man.

1174
01:55:13,706 --> 01:55:14,410
He's dead, man.

1175
01:55:14,415 --> 01:55:15,908
Hold on, man. Let me think. Just Let me think.

1176
01:55:15,999 --> 01:55:18,719
We're going to handle this. It's okay. We got this,

1177
01:55:19,169 --> 01:55:20,954
Shh, okay.

1178
01:55:21,839 --> 01:55:23,290
Now listen, you're gonna get back.

1179
01:55:27,678 --> 01:55:30,297
It's just we don't got enough time, Sanborn.

1180
01:55:30,347 --> 01:55:32,941
I just gotta... I gotta get these bolts off.

1181
01:55:33,434 --> 01:55:36,724
No, We got a minute and a half, man. We gotta get out of here.

1182
01:55:36,729 --> 01:55:39,560
- I'll handle this. Just go.    - Come on, man.

1183
01:55:39,565 --> 01:55:41,396
Look, I'm right behind ya. Just go.

1184
01:55:41,401 --> 01:55:43,188
Fuck him! Come on, Let's go,

1185
01:55:43,193 --> 01:55:46,025
- Sanborn, I got the suit. Just go,    - James!

1186
01:55:46,030 --> 01:55:50,067
Sanborn, you have 45 seconds. You have 45 seconds. Sanborn, Leave,

1187
01:55:50,200 --> 01:55:51,905
You're fucking dead, man. Dead.

1188
01:55:51,910 --> 01:55:53,991
Go!

1189
01:55:53,996 --> 01:55:56,798
- Everybody get back!    - Go, go!

1190
01:56:02,046 --> 01:56:03,455
We got one.

1191
01:56:04,173 --> 01:56:06,667
Go, get back.

1192
01:56:09,178 --> 01:56:14,399
I can't. There's too many locks. There's too many, I can't do it,

1193
01:56:14,600 --> 01:56:16,593
I can't get it off. I'm sorry, Okay!

1194
01:56:16,685 --> 01:56:18,262
You understand? I'm sorry,

1195
01:56:19,063 --> 01:56:21,852
I'm sorry. You hear me? I'm sorry,

1196
01:56:21,857 --> 01:56:24,276
- Get down now!    - I can help him.

1197
01:56:26,862 --> 01:56:30,294
Everybody stay down!

1198
01:56:53,180 --> 01:56:54,256
James!

1199
01:56:54,390 --> 01:56:56,775
Everybody up and out, James!

1200
01:57:43,147 --> 01:57:44,398
You all right?

1201
01:57:47,693 --> 01:57:48,810
Aw, man,

1202
01:57:51,697 --> 01:57:53,665
I fuckin' hate this place.

1203
01:57:56,285 --> 01:57:57,836
Here, man. Have a hit.

1204
01:58:12,009 --> 01:58:14,311
I'm not ready to die, James.

1205
01:58:16,430 --> 01:58:18,357
Well, you're not going to die out here, bro.

1206
01:58:19,725 --> 01:58:21,510
Another two inches.

1207
01:58:24,313 --> 01:58:27,282
Shrapnel zings by, slices my throat.

1208
01:58:28,650 --> 01:58:31,411
I bleed out like a pig in the sand,

1209
01:58:33,697 --> 01:58:35,791
Nobody'll give a shit.

1210
01:58:38,410 --> 01:58:41,995
I mean, my parents'll care, but they don't count, man, Who else?

1211
01:58:49,505 --> 01:58:51,298
I don't even have a son.

1212
01:58:57,971 --> 01:59:00,495
Well, you're going to have plenty of time for that, amigo.

1213
01:59:00,974 --> 01:59:03,051
- Naw, man    - You know?

1214
01:59:04,853 --> 01:59:06,138
I'm done,

1215
01:59:11,485 --> 01:59:12,978
I want a son,

1216
01:59:16,907 --> 01:59:18,951
I want a little boy, Will.

1217
01:59:25,666 --> 01:59:28,076
I mean, how do you do it, you know?

1218
01:59:29,712 --> 01:59:31,388
Take the risk?

1219
01:59:38,929 --> 01:59:41,398
I don't know, I just...

1220
01:59:43,851 --> 01:59:45,319
I guess I don't think about it.

1221
01:59:58,782 --> 02:00:01,376
But you realize every time you suit up,

1222
02:00:02,453 --> 02:00:04,212
every time we go out

1223
02:00:05,080 --> 02:00:07,841
it's life or death. You roll the dice

1224
02:00:09,877 --> 02:00:11,345
and you deal with it.

1225
02:00:13,589 --> 02:00:15,474
You recognize that, don't you?

1226
02:00:20,971 --> 02:00:22,256
Yeah

1227
02:00:32,274 --> 02:00:33,725
Yeah, I do.

1228
02:00:35,402 --> 02:00:37,062
But I don't know why.

1229
02:00:39,031 --> 02:00:40,357
Yeah.

1230
02:00:49,833 --> 02:00:54,429
I don't know, JT. You know why I am the way I am?

1231
02:00:59,927 --> 02:01:01,211
Naw, I don't.

1232
02:02:03,449 --> 02:02:07,336
- Wow! You did some shopping.    - Yeah.

1233
02:02:07,786 --> 02:02:09,796
I got some soda. We done?

1234
02:02:11,206 --> 02:02:13,759
You want to go get us some cereal and I'll meet you at the checkout?

1235
02:02:14,752 --> 02:02:16,745
Okay, cereal.

1236
02:02:21,008 --> 02:02:21,998
Where?

1237
02:03:21,610 --> 02:03:25,372
Some guy drove his truck to the middle of an Iraqi market,

1238
02:03:25,906 --> 02:03:27,945
starts passing out free candies.

1239
02:03:27,950 --> 02:03:30,752
All the kids coming running up, the families stuff,

1240
02:03:32,663 --> 02:03:33,999
He detonates.

1241
02:03:36,583 --> 02:03:38,160
They're saying 59 are dead.

1242
02:03:48,512 --> 02:03:50,522
You know they need more bomb techs.

1243
02:03:54,393 --> 02:03:55,886
You want to chop those up for me?

1244
02:04:07,156 --> 02:04:08,148
Yeah

1245
02:04:10,242 --> 02:04:12,152
You love playing with that.

1246
02:04:12,953 --> 02:04:15,364
You love playing with all your stuffed animals.

1247
02:04:16,290 --> 02:04:21,999
You love your mommy, your daddy, your nature pajamas.

1248
02:04:22,087 --> 02:04:25,082
You love everything, don't you? Yeah

1249
02:04:26,508 --> 02:04:27,991
You know what, buddy?

1250
02:04:28,886 --> 02:04:30,379
Once you get older,

1251
02:04:31,096 --> 02:04:36,735
some of the things that you love might not seem so special anymore.

1252
02:04:37,269 --> 02:04:39,321
Like your Jack In The Box,

1253
02:04:42,107 --> 02:04:47,204
Maybe you realize it's just a piece of tin and a stuffed animal

1254
02:04:49,156 --> 02:04:53,585
and then you forget the few things you really love,

1255
02:04:56,622 --> 02:05:00,467
And by the time you get to my age maybe it's only one or two things,

1256
02:05:08,759 --> 02:05:10,936
With me I think it's one,

1257
02:05:47,381 --> 02:05:49,975
- Welcome to Delta Company    - Sergeant
