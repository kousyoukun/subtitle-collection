1
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:23,281
<i>You sure it's the Russians?</i>

2
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:25,189
One hundred percent, sir.
Submarine launched...

3
00:05:25,189 --> 00:05:28,900
12 to 15 megatons, and they went
to strike status 15 minutes prior.

4
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,457
<i>CINC-LANT reports the Roosevelt
splashed six incoming cruise missiles.</i>

5
00:05:31,457 --> 00:05:33,465
The Russians are moving
west through Poland.

6
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:35,865
If they head for Germany,
the Berlin Brigade is outnumbered.

7
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:41,830
We've got another launch
from Alyesk, Central Russia.

8
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,171
I don't believe it.
What the hell's in Alyesk?

9
00:05:44,171 --> 00:05:48,976
SS-18 ICBMs. Probable targets--
New York, Washington, here.

10
00:05:48,976 --> 00:05:51,642
- How good is this ceiling?
- Anything but a direct hit.

11
00:05:51,642 --> 00:05:54,152
Satellites confirm birds
in the air-- multiple launches.

12
00:05:54,152 --> 00:05:57,018
- First impact estimated 25 minutes.
- How do we know that's accurate?

13
00:05:57,018 --> 00:05:58,523
It's accurate.

14
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:00,616
Sir, I advise we go to DEFCON-1.

15
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:03,025
- Get President Zorkin on the hot line.
- Zorkin is missing.

16
00:06:03,025 --> 00:06:06,032
We have reports of a coup in Moscow.

17
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:08,432
General Bulgakov
is calling the shots now.

18
00:06:08,432 --> 00:06:10,163
Who the hell is Bulgakov?

19
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:13,569
The asshole who wanted
to use nukes in Chechnya.

20
00:06:28,456 --> 00:06:31,323
Sir, DEFCON-1,
we're out of time.

21
00:06:37,098 --> 00:06:37,818
Do it.

22
00:06:40,803 --> 00:06:42,202
Mr. President.

23
00:06:43,338 --> 00:06:47,205
After you give the order, the launch
sequence takes a minute to process.

24
00:06:47,205 --> 00:06:50,505
Before the order can be taken,
an I.D. check must be performed.

25
00:06:50,505 --> 00:06:53,102
My I.D. number is fifth
from the top.

26
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,953
- Sir, it's your wife on 2104.
- Thank you.

27
00:07:03,392 --> 00:07:05,087
Under the two-man rule...

28
00:07:05,087 --> 00:07:08,789
the order must be confirmed
by someone on the approved list.

29
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:10,865
Gene Revell,
National Security Advisor.

30
00:07:10,865 --> 00:07:12,935
- Second from the top.
- Is it black-tie?

31
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:15,266
Okay, I'm on my way.

32
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:20,107
Can we...

33
00:07:21,376 --> 00:07:23,401
finish this up some other time?

34
00:07:33,757 --> 00:07:36,282
We gotta update
these fire drills, Billy.

35
00:07:36,282 --> 00:07:39,555
If the shit ever hits the fan,
I'm not goin' underground.

36
00:07:39,555 --> 00:07:42,028
The place is a goddamn tomb.

37
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:46,365
We have to choose someone to face
off against besides the Russians.

38
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:51,066
Really? Let's see. Who else has
27,000 nukes for us to worry about?

39
00:07:51,066 --> 00:07:53,734
It's the guy with one
I'm worried about.

40
00:07:53,734 --> 00:07:56,368
Speaking of Russia, I have
to send some folks over there...

41
00:07:56,368 --> 00:07:58,845
inspect their nuclear
decommissioning facility.

42
00:07:58,845 --> 00:08:02,112
- Place called ''Armazaz.''
- Arzamas.

43
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:05,552
Yeah. Whatever. Someone from
your staff should be on the trip.

44
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,647
I'll go.

45
00:08:07,647 --> 00:08:09,589
Billy, send staff.

46
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:11,092
I wanna go.

47
00:08:12,563 --> 00:08:14,463
Okay.

48
00:08:14,463 --> 00:08:17,090
And don't underestimate
Zorkin, pal.

49
00:08:17,090 --> 00:08:19,466
Between his economy,
crime, Chechnya--

50
00:08:19,466 --> 00:08:21,869
- His liver.
- What's left of it.

51
00:08:21,869 --> 00:08:23,270
How is he?

52
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:25,536
He's scheduled a press conference
for this afternoon...

53
00:08:25,536 --> 00:08:27,702
so at least we know
he can sit up.

54
00:08:29,647 --> 00:08:32,445
<i>- Why not negotiate?
- The interview is over.</i>

55
00:08:39,257 --> 00:08:42,784
<i>Only criminals and their friends
in the West wish it to be separate.</i>

56
00:08:42,784 --> 00:08:46,455
<i>But, Mr. President,
if you will kindly come back...</i>

57
00:08:46,455 --> 00:08:49,625
<i>we do have a few more questions
we would like to ask you.</i>

58
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,896
You see what I see?

59
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,433
- His jacket.
- He used to button it all the way.

60
00:08:56,433 --> 00:08:58,100
He's gettin' fat!

61
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:01,737
I know how he feels.
Wow. Look at that.

62
00:09:01,737 --> 00:09:03,747
Maybe it's not the same jacket.

63
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:07,478
No-- Yeah. Shiny sleeves. He wore it
last time he got out of the hospital.

64
00:09:07,478 --> 00:09:10,215
- He's definitely off the diet.
- He's also off the wagon.

65
00:09:10,215 --> 00:09:12,689
You hear how he slurred?

66
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:16,751
That must be why Chelinski's hanging
around, to keep him off the sauce.

67
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:18,262
Where's Chelinski?

68
00:09:18,262 --> 00:09:23,096
Next to-- What's her name?
The chick with the brown hair.

69
00:09:23,096 --> 00:09:26,262
- Elena Rishkov.
- No, that is not Chelinski.

70
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,240
Busted. It's Chelinski.

71
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,708
You're thinking Cherpitski.
That ain't Cherpitski, either.

72
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,007
- I know. It's Chelinski.
- No, it's not. Trust me.

73
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:40,016
He's next to Elena Rishkov. He was
banging her at the Geneva Summit.

74
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:42,417
Chelinski was not at Geneva.
Cherpitski was at Geneva.

75
00:09:42,417 --> 00:09:45,354
What are you saying? Cherpitski
was banging Elena Rishkov?

76
00:09:46,525 --> 00:09:51,792
I say Zorkin's putting on weight.
Why reduce everything to sex?

77
00:09:51,792 --> 00:09:54,662
I agree. Write it up.
And if he is putting on weight...

78
00:09:54,662 --> 00:09:58,396
that might have health consequences
so get it in the afternoon brief.

79
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:04,739
And somebody find out who is banging
Elena Rishkov. This is good.

80
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:10,173
<i>What shall we make of Chechnya...</i>

81
00:10:10,173 --> 00:10:12,751
asking the West for protection?

82
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:14,945
She is like a beautiful virgin...

83
00:10:14,945 --> 00:10:18,855
escaping the clutches
of a lecherous bear...

84
00:10:18,855 --> 00:10:22,326
and running to Bill Clinton
to save her maidenhood.

85
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:26,661
A poet once wrote:

86
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:30,328
''Meet the new boss,
same as the old boss.''

87
00:10:30,328 --> 00:10:34,841
He could have been writing of us,
of Europe in the 21st century.

88
00:10:36,878 --> 00:10:39,676
Over 50 years
of America and Russia...

89
00:10:39,676 --> 00:10:44,911
imposing their will on the European
community-- East and West.

90
00:10:46,486 --> 00:10:50,583
And we are still treated
like children...

91
00:10:50,583 --> 00:10:55,095
but without the toys
or the good-night chocolates.

92
00:10:55,095 --> 00:10:58,825
Each day we lose a little bit
more of our separate...

93
00:10:58,825 --> 00:11:02,767
sovereign ability to determine
our own futures.

94
00:11:02,767 --> 00:11:07,274
And each day the world comes closer
to that terrible moment...

95
00:11:07,274 --> 00:11:10,140
when the beating
of a butterfly's wings...

96
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,645
unleashes a hurricane...

97
00:11:12,645 --> 00:11:15,443
God himself cannot stop.

98
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:38,997
Was that yours or mine?

99
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,629
It must be yours.
Mine's just for show.

100
00:13:51,878 --> 00:13:54,211
- It's not the hospital.
- Cool.

101
00:13:54,211 --> 00:13:58,273
- Good. Hi.
- You're still here?

102
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:02,150
I think to be accurate
and everything...

103
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,655
it's actually you are still here.

104
00:14:06,492 --> 00:14:08,187
Oh. Right.

105
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:11,722
Not that I'm complaining.

106
00:14:16,737 --> 00:14:18,568
Jack?

107
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:20,833
I know this is new
and all, but--

108
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,602
I have something I have to say
or I'm gonna explode.

109
00:14:26,602 --> 00:14:29,478
I don't want you to be scared.

110
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,348
What?

111
00:14:38,192 --> 00:14:40,251
You're in love with me.

112
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:51,298
I'm a medical professional.
I can read the symptoms.

113
00:14:51,298 --> 00:14:54,068
You're definitely
in love with me.

114
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:58,010
And that scares you.

115
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,579
Not even a little.

116
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:05,386
But I think it scares you.

117
00:15:05,386 --> 00:15:07,546
No. Not even a little.

118
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:14,651
And, for the record,
you're the one who brought it up.

119
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:22,828
Forget it.

120
00:15:22,828 --> 00:15:26,374
- I'm gonna get it.
- No, wait. It'll stop.

121
00:15:27,810 --> 00:15:30,301
I don't know who this is.

122
00:15:30,301 --> 00:15:32,380
But--

123
00:15:33,282 --> 00:15:35,717
-Just go about your business.
- The timing sucks.

124
00:15:35,717 --> 00:15:38,083
Do what you have to do.
I totally understand.

125
00:15:38,083 --> 00:15:41,248
Yes. This is Dr. Muller.

126
00:15:41,248 --> 00:15:43,518
Muller. You paged me?

127
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:46,481
Hello?

128
00:15:47,863 --> 00:15:50,331
Stop. Yes, this is Jack Ryan.

129
00:15:52,802 --> 00:15:53,522
Jesus.

130
00:15:55,105 --> 00:15:57,505
Okay. I'll be there
in half an hour.

131
00:15:58,675 --> 00:16:02,805
I gotta go. I have
an emergency at work.

132
00:16:02,805 --> 00:16:04,937
I have to run. I'm sorry.

133
00:16:06,249 --> 00:16:08,718
Cathy, how about dinner tonight?

134
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,343
Yeah.

135
00:16:10,343 --> 00:16:13,855
- How about tomorrow night?
-Jack, I said yes to tonight.

136
00:16:14,692 --> 00:16:16,386
I know.

137
00:16:19,296 --> 00:16:22,459
What kind of emergency
does an historian have?

138
00:16:22,459 --> 00:16:24,124
<i>He died at 04 20 Zulu.</i>

139
00:16:24,124 --> 00:16:26,430
Eight and a half hours later,
they swore in a new president.

140
00:16:26,430 --> 00:16:28,732
Everybody wants to know
who this new guy is.

141
00:16:28,732 --> 00:16:31,933
- Who is he?
- Alexander Nemerov.

142
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:35,137
You're kidding me. I wrote
a paper about him a year ago.

143
00:16:35,137 --> 00:16:37,942
- I know.
- Mary Pat, I said he could be next.

144
00:16:37,942 --> 00:16:40,848
I said he could be next. I predicted
this. And nobody read it.

145
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:42,852
- They're reading it now.
- Who?

146
00:16:42,852 --> 00:16:45,479
- Cabot.
- I've been here 14 months.

147
00:16:45,479 --> 00:16:47,455
I don't think he knows
what I look--

148
00:16:51,329 --> 00:16:53,797
Are you Ryan?

149
00:16:53,797 --> 00:16:55,126
Yes, sir.

150
00:16:58,003 --> 00:17:00,972
<i>What is this? The Paper Chase?</i>

151
00:17:04,009 --> 00:17:06,068
Sir, my--

152
00:17:06,068 --> 00:17:08,078
Come on. We're late.

153
00:17:13,151 --> 00:17:17,282
You're about to breathe air that's
over your pay grade, so listen up.

154
00:17:17,282 --> 00:17:19,290
You're gonna be asked
for analysis and advice.

155
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,189
Be sure you know what you're
talking about before you give it.

156
00:17:22,189 --> 00:17:24,352
Don't be afraid to say
you don't know.

157
00:17:24,352 --> 00:17:27,829
Choose your words carefully. Words
have a habit of becoming policy.

158
00:17:27,829 --> 00:17:31,096
You, you. Give me your coat.
Come on.

159
00:17:31,096 --> 00:17:33,194
You'll get it back.

160
00:17:37,843 --> 00:17:39,242
Tie.

161
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:48,045
<i>So, Intelligence Committee?</i>

162
00:17:48,045 --> 00:17:49,644
Mm-hmm.

163
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:52,384
I've watched these on C-SPAN.

164
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:54,790
Never actually been to one.

165
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,056
You've never watched one
of these on C-SPAN.

166
00:18:18,384 --> 00:18:23,652
Our most important assessment comes
from a high source in the Kremlin.

167
00:18:23,652 --> 00:18:27,488
In his opinion, Nemerov does not
owe his ascension to the military.

168
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:31,359
Everyone has opinions,
Mr. Cabot.

169
00:18:31,359 --> 00:18:33,432
I respect that.

170
00:18:33,432 --> 00:18:37,799
This morning my wife woke up
and said I was old, bald and ugly.

171
00:18:39,606 --> 00:18:41,767
Is that a question, Mr. Chairman?

172
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:45,443
I told her appearances
aren't everything.

173
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:48,276
- Would you agree, Mr. Cabot?
- I certainly would, sir.

174
00:18:48,276 --> 00:18:52,978
Now, this new fellow ''Nezmeroz''--
Is that his name?

175
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:55,954
Nemerov, sir.

176
00:18:55,954 --> 00:19:00,585
Despite what your source says,
we hear ''Nezmeroz'' is a hard-liner.

177
00:19:00,585 --> 00:19:03,027
Is he a hard-liner?

178
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:03,777
No.

179
00:19:04,598 --> 00:19:07,499
It's a bit too soon
to make that assessment, sir.

180
00:19:07,499 --> 00:19:09,159
According to CNN...

181
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:13,206
your Mr. ''Nezmeroz''
is making promises...

182
00:19:13,206 --> 00:19:15,970
to rebuild the Russian Empire.

183
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,478
That sounds pretty rash
from where I sit.

184
00:19:19,478 --> 00:19:22,846
If I were sitting in Chechnya,
I'd be even more worried.

185
00:19:24,085 --> 00:19:27,714
Sir, Nemerov's saying what he needs
to get the hard-liners off his back.

186
00:19:27,714 --> 00:19:30,815
If we leave him alone, Russia will
stabilize. Push him, bets are off.

187
00:19:30,815 --> 00:19:35,124
When I asked for your advice,
I didn't mean you should actually speak.

188
00:19:35,124 --> 00:19:36,391
Yes, sir.

189
00:19:36,391 --> 00:19:37,897
Mr. Cabot.

190
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,335
Mr. Chairman, some of our assets
in the Russian government...

191
00:19:42,335 --> 00:19:45,874
who actually know Mr. Nemerov,
have not had a chance to report in.

192
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,875
I'd like to take
a couple of days...

193
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:51,174
and get more information for you
before characterizing him.

194
00:19:52,214 --> 00:19:56,207
But I do maintain my opinion
that appearances can be deceiving.

195
00:19:56,207 --> 00:19:58,684
You're saying I'm wrong?

196
00:19:58,684 --> 00:20:01,483
Absolutely, Mr. Chairman.

197
00:20:04,327 --> 00:20:06,261
I don't think you're ugly.

198
00:20:09,232 --> 00:20:12,723
- I apologize for being out of line.
- Senators don't like surprises.

199
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,997
I give them a hint of what
I'm going to tell them...

200
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:18,802
then I give them a while
to get used to it.

201
00:20:18,802 --> 00:20:21,275
Then I tell them.

202
00:20:21,275 --> 00:20:22,777
I understand.

203
00:20:22,777 --> 00:20:24,744
Good.

204
00:20:24,744 --> 00:20:26,748
But I'm right about Nemerov.

205
00:20:29,619 --> 00:20:33,385
Your girlfriend like
this stubborn streak in you?

206
00:20:33,385 --> 00:20:35,459
What?

207
00:20:35,459 --> 00:20:38,825
Cathy Muller,
second-year surgical resident...

208
00:20:38,825 --> 00:20:41,228
Baltimore Memorial Hospital.

209
00:20:44,167 --> 00:20:46,362
Welcome to the CIA, sport.

210
00:20:47,837 --> 00:20:51,637
Well, your intelligence is just
a little flawed in this matter.

211
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:55,109
I wouldn't call her
my girlfriend yet.

212
00:20:55,109 --> 00:20:57,180
What exactly would you call her?

213
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,545
Great. Amazing.

214
00:20:59,545 --> 00:21:01,811
She's just afraid to commit.

215
00:21:01,811 --> 00:21:03,819
He's terrified of commitment.

216
00:21:03,819 --> 00:21:06,389
The man is afraid of commitment
after three dates?

217
00:21:06,389 --> 00:21:08,617
- Alert the media.
- I know, I know.

218
00:21:08,617 --> 00:21:10,627
What does he do?

219
00:21:10,627 --> 00:21:14,096
He was in the marines
before he hurt his back.

220
00:21:14,096 --> 00:21:16,861
- Now he's an historian.
- Yawn.

221
00:21:16,861 --> 00:21:20,563
No. He works for a think tank
across the river.

222
00:21:20,563 --> 00:21:22,434
Double yawn.

223
00:21:22,434 --> 00:21:24,440
All right, Rita.

224
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,569
Let's see what you have to say
after you meet him tonight.

225
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,146
He's--

226
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:33,144
Cute?

227
00:21:33,144 --> 00:21:36,584
- I have fat fingers.
- Cathy!

228
00:21:36,584 --> 00:21:40,749
- Cute scale. One to ten.
- Oh, God! I don't know.

229
00:21:42,528 --> 00:21:44,496
Twelve.

230
00:21:50,969 --> 00:21:52,869
Ask them where they found this.

231
00:22:00,246 --> 00:22:02,476
In the field, in the Golan.

232
00:22:03,549 --> 00:22:07,679
There was a lot of fighting in 1973.
Did they witness it?

233
00:22:13,593 --> 00:22:17,086
This one says he lost his son.

234
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:20,689
Does he remember?
Was there a plane shot down?

235
00:22:30,109 --> 00:22:33,307
Yes. An Israeli jet, destroyed.

236
00:22:42,489 --> 00:22:44,389
This is worthless.

237
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:50,996
But tell him...

238
00:22:50,996 --> 00:22:54,728
I will give him $400
because of his son.

239
00:23:05,646 --> 00:23:07,672
Thank-- Thank you.

240
00:23:13,321 --> 00:23:15,551
<i>You don't find this lying around.</i>

241
00:23:15,551 --> 00:23:18,057
<i>-Absolutely not.
- How did you come by it?</i>

242
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:23,223
<i>I found her in the attic
of an old mansion in Glasgow.</i>

243
00:23:23,223 --> 00:23:24,799
<i>All right.</i>

244
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:28,927
<i>Your trip to the attic actually
has got you a piece worth...</i>

245
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:31,665
<i>the best part of a thousand pounds,
even in this condition.</i>

246
00:23:31,665 --> 00:23:36,210
<i>Had she been in better condition,
even more. Ajolly nice find.</i>

247
00:24:14,885 --> 00:24:16,750
Hello? Cathy.

248
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,482
So glad you called. I'm running
a little late. I'm sorry.

249
00:24:20,482 --> 00:24:22,615
Can you come a half an hour later?

250
00:24:22,615 --> 00:24:26,457
I can't make it.
I'm really sorry.

251
00:24:29,332 --> 00:24:31,858
<i>It was a last-minute work thing.</i>

252
00:24:34,772 --> 00:24:36,171
What's that noise?

253
00:24:38,775 --> 00:24:40,675
I'm calling from a plane.

254
00:24:40,675 --> 00:24:44,838
<i>-This just came up. I tried to call.
-Where are you going?</i>

255
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,851
- I can't tell you that.
-Jack.

256
00:24:49,851 --> 00:24:51,854
You can't tell me
where you're going?

257
00:24:53,591 --> 00:24:56,492
- Hold on one second. Yes, sir?
- What are you doing?

258
00:24:57,862 --> 00:25:00,490
I had a date tonight,
so I had to call and cancel.

259
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:03,294
Don't be stupid.
Tell her where you're going.

260
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:04,970
In fact, tell her who you work for.
She'll be impressed.

261
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,835
In fact, tell her who you work for.
She'll be impressed.

262
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,771
I work for the CIA and the director
asked me at the last minute...

263
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:19,212
to come with him to Russia
to do a nuclear arms inspection.

264
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,919
<i>- That is so lame.
- I swear.</i>

265
00:25:24,919 --> 00:25:26,649
We're making sure...

266
00:25:26,649 --> 00:25:28,657
they're decommissioning
their nuclear arsenal.

267
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,533
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

268
00:26:23,749 --> 00:26:27,447
<i>Zdrastuyte, William Cabot.</i>

269
00:26:28,688 --> 00:26:30,246
President Nemerov.

270
00:26:43,937 --> 00:26:45,428
Pleasure, sir.

271
00:26:45,428 --> 00:26:47,439
May I present Mrs. Lathrop.

272
00:26:48,309 --> 00:26:49,901
Mr. President.

273
00:26:49,901 --> 00:26:51,637
- General Rand.
- Mr. President.

274
00:26:53,613 --> 00:26:56,343
- And Dr. Ryan.
- Mr. President.

275
00:27:00,386 --> 00:27:04,824
You must be the Dr. Ryan who's done
such interesting research on me.

276
00:27:08,162 --> 00:27:11,723
You should not be surprised by this.
We know quite a bit.

277
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:18,720
For instance, we know
how wrong you were in your report.....

278
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,398
...that I had many girlfriends in college.

279
00:27:28,215 --> 00:27:31,776
I met my wife in my third year and
haven't looked at another women since.

280
00:27:33,187 --> 00:27:35,520
I was referring
to the first two years...

281
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:37,458
sir.

282
00:27:50,939 --> 00:27:52,965
I like him.

283
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:57,072
In that case, so do I.

284
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:04,083
Let me apologize for interjecting
myself in your inspection tour.

285
00:28:04,083 --> 00:28:07,677
But there is a message I wish
for you to take to President Fowler.

286
00:28:07,677 --> 00:28:10,122
You could just call him
on the phone.

287
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:14,322
I would like him to hear it from
you, his friend of many years...

288
00:28:14,322 --> 00:28:16,796
who received it
personally from me...

289
00:28:16,796 --> 00:28:21,598
saw my expression and the language
of my body as I spoke it.

290
00:28:21,598 --> 00:28:23,103
I understand.

291
00:28:24,808 --> 00:28:27,208
Chechnya is an internal affair.

292
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,711
What we do there should be
none of your concern.

293
00:28:31,815 --> 00:28:34,984
I will relay the message,
but I don't think he will agree.

294
00:28:34,984 --> 00:28:38,351
There are those in my country who
will use this issue to weaken me.

295
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:43,120
There are those in my country
who say your war in Chechnya...

296
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,956
is exactly your weakness.

297
00:28:45,956 --> 00:28:47,963
Chechnya is a nation of criminals.

298
00:28:47,963 --> 00:28:52,434
Every day brings another cowardly
attack on innocent Russian citizens.

299
00:28:52,434 --> 00:28:54,436
It is none of your concern.

300
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,205
Stability is our concern.

301
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:01,972
Peace in Chechnya is our concern.

302
00:29:03,081 --> 00:29:07,107
And, if I may speak frankly...

303
00:29:07,107 --> 00:29:10,414
your control over your military
concerns us too.

304
00:29:18,296 --> 00:29:21,959
For you to get
involved here, it's...

305
00:29:21,959 --> 00:29:24,466
like sleeping
with another man's wife.

306
00:29:26,037 --> 00:29:29,302
And what you are suggesting
is that afterward...

307
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:31,842
they can all live together
under the same roof.

308
00:29:34,613 --> 00:29:37,582
But what really happens is...

309
00:29:37,582 --> 00:29:40,742
the betrayed husband buys a gun.

310
00:29:49,428 --> 00:29:51,293
That went well.

311
00:29:51,293 --> 00:29:54,194
- Who's the guy with Nemerov?
- Anatoli Grushkov.

312
00:29:54,194 --> 00:29:55,527
Old KGB?

313
00:29:55,527 --> 00:29:58,194
Been lurking around since Brezhnev.
Plays all sides.

314
00:29:58,194 --> 00:30:00,828
And nobody's had the guts
to get rid of him.

315
00:30:00,828 --> 00:30:02,930
Is that because he knows
where the bodies are buried?

316
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:06,136
Probably because
he buried them himself.

317
00:30:19,791 --> 00:30:24,559
And we were able to obtain a roster
of their scientists at Arzamas.

318
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,565
Who's who,
what their expertise is.

319
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:03,632
Arzamas-16 is home
to the All-Russian...

320
00:31:03,632 --> 00:31:07,867
Scientific Research Institute
of Experimental Physics and...

321
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:11,604
is the birthplace
of our first atomic bomb.

322
00:31:11,604 --> 00:31:16,582
Many of our greatest scientists
worked here and many still do.

323
00:31:16,582 --> 00:31:18,676
Since 1995--

324
00:31:27,394 --> 00:31:31,331
We tried so hard
to get in here over the years.

325
00:31:31,331 --> 00:31:33,958
I sent three people.

326
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,895
They all died trying.

327
00:32:03,866 --> 00:32:05,766
What does the T-shirt say?

328
00:32:07,136 --> 00:32:11,232
''I am a bomb technician.
If you see me running...

329
00:32:11,232 --> 00:32:13,240
try to catch up.''

330
00:32:19,082 --> 00:32:21,778
Sir? I'm sorry.
Just one quick thing.

331
00:32:21,778 --> 00:32:23,785
I'm sure it's nothing.

332
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:28,323
According to this, there are 17
senior scientists on duty today.

333
00:32:30,793 --> 00:32:33,193
I only count 14.

334
00:32:34,096 --> 00:32:38,397
Doctors Milinov, Orlov
and Spassky.

335
00:32:38,397 --> 00:32:41,027
They don't seem to be here.

336
00:32:41,027 --> 00:32:43,504
I will make inquiries.

337
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,768
Dr. Milinov is out sick.

338
00:32:45,768 --> 00:32:50,643
Orlov is on vacation. Spassky,
I'm grieved to say, was killed...

339
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:53,774
driving his car to work
just this past week.

340
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,656
We move on, shall we?

341
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:03,453
Please.

342
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:07,161
Very impressive.

343
00:33:07,161 --> 00:33:10,632
You almost seemed to have
that information memorized.

344
00:33:10,632 --> 00:33:13,135
I assumed you would ask,
Dr. Ryan.

345
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:53,109
We touch down at Andrews at 2130.
Tell him to meet me there.

346
00:33:53,109 --> 00:33:56,009
Sir, those three missing scientists?

347
00:33:56,009 --> 00:33:58,480
Milinov's expertise
is detonators.

348
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:01,815
Spassky's expertise is the package,
the nuclear core itself.

349
00:34:01,815 --> 00:34:04,548
And Orlov is a mathematician
whose expertise is the geometry...

350
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:08,523
of high explosives
inside a fission bomb.

351
00:34:08,523 --> 00:34:12,357
Exact three men you would need
if you wanted to build a bomb.

352
00:34:12,357 --> 00:34:15,455
- Grushkov would have us believe--
- Grushkov's a liar.

353
00:34:15,455 --> 00:34:19,560
Milinov is not sick. Orlov hasn't
taken a vacation in years.

354
00:34:19,560 --> 00:34:23,437
And Spassky, who's supposed to have
died driving a car, doesn't drive.

355
00:34:25,511 --> 00:34:28,480
They have no idea
where these guys are.

356
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm dying to ask you
how you know that.

357
00:34:39,058 --> 00:34:41,185
Secure source inside the Kremlin.

358
00:34:41,185 --> 00:34:43,158
Code name: Spinnaker.

359
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:46,425
He gives me stuff.
I give him stuff.

360
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:50,970
We keep the back channels open
in hopes of staving off disaster.

361
00:34:50,970 --> 00:34:55,268
And speaking of disaster,
did you call your girlfriend yet?

362
00:34:55,268 --> 00:34:58,833
No. I haven't figured out how
I'm gonna dig myself out of this.

363
00:34:59,813 --> 00:35:02,338
Listen. Call her up
and invite her...

364
00:35:02,338 --> 00:35:05,145
to the White House
Correspondents' Dinner Sunday night.

365
00:35:05,145 --> 00:35:07,584
It's the hottest ticket in town.
She'll love it.

366
00:35:08,556 --> 00:35:10,490
That sounds great.
How do I get in?

367
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:12,388
Trust me.

368
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,732
I'll see you at the car.

369
00:35:40,655 --> 00:35:42,589
Still loving your desk job?

370
00:35:43,992 --> 00:35:46,654
Yeah, I am.

371
00:35:46,654 --> 00:35:48,990
How's your Russian?

372
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,996
It still works.
Why?

373
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:54,765
Three Russian nuclear scientists
are missing.

374
00:35:54,765 --> 00:35:56,860
I need to know where they are.

375
00:36:01,710 --> 00:36:03,701
I thought I wasn't
doing this anymore.

376
00:36:03,701 --> 00:36:06,610
I just need information
this time,Johnny.

377
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:10,310
Your orders are on the plane.
Wheels up at 2330.

378
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,545
Have a nice flight.

379
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:22,929
Sunday night at 8:00
at the Hilton.

380
00:36:22,929 --> 00:36:25,864
The tickets are under the name
of John Clark.

381
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:29,562
- You do have a tux?
- Yeah! Yes, sir.

382
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:38,071
<i>My beautiful wife, Julie...</i>

383
00:36:38,071 --> 00:36:41,547
is from New Jersey--
15 electoral votes.

384
00:36:43,486 --> 00:36:46,080
And is, as you know,
half Jewish...

385
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:50,523
so we'll take Florida's
25 electoral votes and divide by two.

386
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:55,720
- This is a nice hotel.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

387
00:36:55,720 --> 00:37:00,131
My friend Rita stayed here once.
She said it was real nice.

388
00:37:02,605 --> 00:37:04,506
Maybe after dinner, we can--

389
00:37:05,642 --> 00:37:09,840
- I don't know. We could get a room.
- I already did.

390
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:12,313
She reminds me that I have
publicly acknowledged...

391
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,908
- No, you didn't.
- Yes, I did.

392
00:37:15,908 --> 00:37:20,115
I did, on a handful of occasions,
smoke marijuana.

393
00:37:21,559 --> 00:37:23,220
California--

394
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:25,694
54 electoral votes.

395
00:38:02,834 --> 00:38:05,997
<i>At approximately 0600, Moscow time,
the Russians launched...</i>

396
00:38:05,997 --> 00:38:10,666
a massive artillery strike against
Grozny, the capital of Chechnya.

397
00:38:10,666 --> 00:38:13,176
The shells contained
an experimental chemical weapon...

398
00:38:13,176 --> 00:38:15,610
known as the Novichok
binary nerve agent.

399
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:18,774
On those infrared sat photos, you
can see saturation took 20 minutes.

400
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:21,552
After which, every man,
woman and child...

401
00:38:21,552 --> 00:38:24,487
inside a radius of 12 miles
was rendered helpless...

402
00:38:24,487 --> 00:38:28,994
by symptoms approximating
acute, late-stage cerebral palsy.

403
00:38:28,994 --> 00:38:31,063
How many dead?

404
00:38:32,132 --> 00:38:34,032
Best guess, 80 percent.

405
00:38:35,235 --> 00:38:37,862
Which means,
Nemerov just launched...

406
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:40,200
the most massive attack
in the history of chemical warfare.

407
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:42,296
Let's talk response.

408
00:38:42,296 --> 00:38:44,673
-Worst thing we could do is nothing.
-I agree.

409
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:48,305
Let him get away with chemical
weapons, what's next? Biological?

410
00:38:48,305 --> 00:38:49,780
Nuclear?

411
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:54,616
Okay. Short of gassing the Kremlin,
what's our strongest response?

412
00:38:54,616 --> 00:38:57,189
- We send in peacekeepers.
- Chechnya's not sovereign.

413
00:38:57,189 --> 00:38:59,884
They requested recognition,
so we recognize them.

414
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:02,724
Not full diplomatic recognition.
Provisional.

415
00:39:02,724 --> 00:39:05,890
Then we get the Chechens to request
emergency international assistance.

416
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:09,026
- And we send in peacekeepers.
- How do you get them in there?

417
00:39:09,026 --> 00:39:12,696
- Fly them in from Turkey.
- Over Armenian airspace?

418
00:39:12,696 --> 00:39:14,865
To screw Russia,
they won't complain.

419
00:39:17,877 --> 00:39:20,278
Let's do it.
Nemerov can choke on it.

420
00:39:22,216 --> 00:39:23,877
Bill.

421
00:39:23,877 --> 00:39:25,212
Dr. Ryan.

422
00:39:25,212 --> 00:39:28,584
- Yes, sir?
- What do you think?

423
00:39:34,261 --> 00:39:37,527
Mr. President, conventional wisdom
would suggest that Nemerov...

424
00:39:37,527 --> 00:39:39,566
is playing the traditional
Russian role--

425
00:39:39,566 --> 00:39:41,863
be aggressive,
flex your muscles...

426
00:39:41,863 --> 00:39:44,233
dare the world to stop you.

427
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:45,737
But Nemerov isn't conventional.

428
00:39:45,737 --> 00:39:48,035
He walks like a hard-liner,
talks like a hard-liner.

429
00:39:48,035 --> 00:39:50,702
Yes, but with all due respect,
I don't think he is one.

430
00:39:50,702 --> 00:39:55,306
He gassed another country's capital.
With all due respect, you're wrong.

431
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:57,317
Why are we wasting our time?

432
00:39:57,317 --> 00:39:59,319
What if he didn't order the attack?

433
00:40:02,157 --> 00:40:04,318
What if Nemerov
didn't order the attack?

434
00:40:06,895 --> 00:40:08,796
What if it was...

435
00:40:08,796 --> 00:40:12,629
a rogue general
or a splinter military unit...

436
00:40:12,629 --> 00:40:15,169
frustrated they couldn't get
their rebels out of the city?

437
00:40:15,169 --> 00:40:18,569
Have you any reason to believe
he didn't order it or are you...

438
00:40:18,569 --> 00:40:20,641
just floating this?

439
00:40:22,744 --> 00:40:24,302
You don't know.

440
00:40:28,117 --> 00:40:30,017
I don't think he did it, sir.

441
00:40:31,254 --> 00:40:33,188
I would bet he didn't do it.

442
00:40:36,325 --> 00:40:39,123
If I could ask senior staff
to remain behind, please.

443
00:40:57,013 --> 00:41:02,350
<i>Roger, we have to interrupt because
we're going back to Moscow...</i>

444
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:06,946
<i>where Russia's newly installed
president, Alexander Nemerov...</i>

445
00:41:06,946 --> 00:41:09,719
<i>has just begun
to address the state.</i>

446
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:12,421
<i>We join him in progress.</i>

447
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:19,934
<i>For ten years now,
we have contended--</i>

448
00:41:19,934 --> 00:41:22,972
Excuse me, sir?
Would you mind turning that up?

449
00:41:28,411 --> 00:41:30,777
<i>Finally...</i>

450
00:41:30,777 --> 00:41:34,248
<i>every nation has a right
to defend itself.</i>

451
00:41:36,486 --> 00:41:38,784
<i>This terrorism must end.</i>

452
00:41:40,257 --> 00:41:43,999
<i>The bombing of Chechnya
was my decision.</i>

453
00:41:48,131 --> 00:41:50,066
Nice going, ace.

454
00:42:28,173 --> 00:42:31,073
<i>And how is our Russian friend
affected by this?</i>

455
00:42:33,344 --> 00:42:35,244
I am not affected.

456
00:42:36,581 --> 00:42:39,710
I remain devoted
to our little plan.

457
00:42:40,486 --> 00:42:42,613
At what you're charging us,
I am not surprised.

458
00:42:44,356 --> 00:42:47,848
- And the American?
- Mr. Mason is a believer.

459
00:42:47,848 --> 00:42:51,760
I put a little extra
in the escrow account for him.

460
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:53,092
Why?

461
00:42:53,092 --> 00:42:56,327
Because he won't live
long enough to receive it.

462
00:42:56,327 --> 00:42:58,404
Where is the package?

463
00:42:58,404 --> 00:43:00,973
It left Haifa a week ago.

464
00:43:02,108 --> 00:43:04,439
I'm told these things
can kill you.

465
00:43:07,947 --> 00:43:11,940
But so much has changed.

466
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:13,952
Perhaps the new situation...

467
00:43:13,952 --> 00:43:19,492
suggests we consider
a different approach?

468
00:43:22,595 --> 00:43:24,756
Maybe try to bring Russia...

469
00:43:24,756 --> 00:43:29,632
more into Europe,
more into our way of thinking.

470
00:43:29,632 --> 00:43:33,195
We have discussed that,
Monsieur Monceau.

471
00:43:33,195 --> 00:43:36,572
And with your concurrence,
rejected it.

472
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,770
Oh, perhaps we were hasty.

473
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:41,779
Perhaps our plan is--

474
00:43:41,779 --> 00:43:43,212
Is what?

475
00:43:46,454 --> 00:43:50,550
Well, not perfectly conceived.

476
00:44:16,350 --> 00:44:21,948
Well, I respect the will
and judgment of my friends.

477
00:44:21,948 --> 00:44:27,427
But in light of the week's events,
I am grown...

478
00:44:27,427 --> 00:44:30,327
uncomfortable with this plan.

479
00:44:30,327 --> 00:44:34,095
So I must beg your leave.

480
00:44:40,176 --> 00:44:42,269
Gentlemen.

481
00:44:46,948 --> 00:44:49,416
Herr Haft will help you out.

482
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:56,581
Your scarf, Monsieur.

483
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:16,001
Mason, would you watch it with that?
You're gonna kill someone.

484
00:45:44,876 --> 00:45:46,776
Yo, what's up, Mason?

485
00:45:49,581 --> 00:45:52,014
I always wanted to ask you.

486
00:45:52,014 --> 00:45:54,277
Where'd you get that tat, man?

487
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:58,753
The navy.

488
00:45:58,753 --> 00:46:01,325
Navy? I was in the navy.

489
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:05,760
Hospital ship, six years. You?

490
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,428
Eight months.

491
00:46:11,469 --> 00:46:13,369
Oh. You wash out?

492
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:23,544
All right, brother.
You have a good one.

493
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:28,241
Yeah, brother.

494
00:46:36,028 --> 00:46:38,428
<i>You've got to realize
the Russian world is watching...</i>

495
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:41,125
<i>and they're gonna take the cue
from us and what we--</i>

496
00:46:41,125 --> 00:46:45,033
<i>The unprecedented attack
on Chechnya...</i>

497
00:46:45,033 --> 00:46:48,300
<i>signals a dangerous and troubling
shift in Russian policy.</i>

498
00:46:49,141 --> 00:46:53,806
<i>It demands the toughest and most
unambiguous response from the West.</i>

499
00:46:55,415 --> 00:46:59,874
<i>NATO forces are on their way to
Chechnya to serve as peacekeepers...</i>

500
00:46:59,874 --> 00:47:04,285
<i>and to provide desperately
needed humanitarian relief.</i>

501
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:06,290
<i>Victims of this monstrous--</i>

502
00:47:28,249 --> 00:47:32,548
These are four hours old. Russian
12th, 15th and 2nd tank regiments.

503
00:47:32,548 --> 00:47:35,246
They haven't moved.
Why haven't they moved?

504
00:47:35,246 --> 00:47:38,518
- Nemerov's too smart to move tanks.
- He speaks.

505
00:47:38,518 --> 00:47:42,357
Jack, look. Nemerov's got,
like, what, 19,000 tanks?

506
00:47:42,357 --> 00:47:45,999
- No way NATO can match that.
- That's why he is not going to move them.

507
00:47:46,634 --> 00:47:48,966
It's a chess game.
He's thinking three moves ahead.

508
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:51,061
He knows he has
more tanks than we do.

509
00:47:51,061 --> 00:47:54,699
NATO says the only way to stop them
is by using tactical nuclear weapons.

510
00:47:54,699 --> 00:47:58,974
And there's no way he wants to risk
a nuclear war over this.

511
00:48:00,282 --> 00:48:02,512
I also think he's
sending us a message.

512
00:48:03,986 --> 00:48:05,885
He didn't bomb Grozny.

513
00:49:28,638 --> 00:49:30,196
<i>Clark got us her number.</i>

514
00:49:30,196 --> 00:49:33,798
NSA collected records of all calls
made to that number and traced it...

515
00:49:33,798 --> 00:49:38,143
back to here, an abandoned Soviet
army base outside Cherkassy...

516
00:49:38,143 --> 00:49:40,341
on the Kremenchug Reservoir.

517
00:49:42,519 --> 00:49:46,250
What are three Russian atomic
scientists doing in Ukraine?

518
00:49:47,557 --> 00:49:50,117
Fair guess,
they're building a bomb.

519
00:49:50,117 --> 00:49:52,490
Nemerov has thousands of bombs.

520
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:54,723
Why does he need
to build a secret one?

521
00:49:54,723 --> 00:49:57,232
Deniability.

522
00:49:57,232 --> 00:49:59,359
Build one nobody knows about.

523
00:49:59,359 --> 00:50:02,997
He could drive it to Chechnya
in the trunk of his Beemer.

524
00:50:02,997 --> 00:50:06,907
No way to track it.
No way to trace it.

525
00:50:06,907 --> 00:50:10,377
And he could set it off, sit back
and say, ''I didn't do it.''

526
00:50:11,281 --> 00:50:14,274
With all due respect, sir,
I don't think that adds up.

527
00:50:14,274 --> 00:50:18,880
It adds up. You just don't like
what it adds up to.

528
00:51:22,022 --> 00:51:24,820
<i>The explosive blocks
must be replaced...</i>

529
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,518
<i>and machined to a thousandth
of a millimeter...</i>

530
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:30,595
<i>in a mathematically
determined configuration.</i>

531
00:51:30,595 --> 00:51:32,425
<i>Do we have a bomb?</i>

532
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:34,499
<i>First, we must analyze the yield--</i>

533
00:51:34,499 --> 00:51:35,727
<i>Spassky...</i>

534
00:51:35,727 --> 00:51:39,670
<i>do we have a bomb?</i>

535
00:51:41,842 --> 00:51:42,900
<i>Yes.</i>

536
00:51:45,946 --> 00:51:47,846
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

537
00:52:05,298 --> 00:52:08,358
This is a test.

538
00:52:08,358 --> 00:52:09,868
Yeah.

539
00:52:11,973 --> 00:52:14,134
Answer it.

540
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:16,335
- Answer it.
- You sure?

541
00:52:16,335 --> 00:52:17,877
Yeah.

542
00:52:21,782 --> 00:52:23,579
Hello?

543
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:25,083
Yes.

544
00:52:31,360 --> 00:52:32,759
Yes, sir.

545
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,391
I have to go outside
for just a second.

546
00:52:42,504 --> 00:52:44,404
Okay? I'll be right back.

547
00:52:44,404 --> 00:52:48,067
I'll be right back.
One second.

548
00:53:01,991 --> 00:53:03,458
<i>I write reports.</i>

549
00:53:03,458 --> 00:53:08,258
I reviewed your military records.
You can take care of yourself.

550
00:53:08,258 --> 00:53:10,991
Yes, sir, but
I'm not trained for that.

551
00:53:10,991 --> 00:53:14,626
I'm asking you to be my eyes and
ears, not an operations officer.

552
00:53:14,626 --> 00:53:16,637
I can't go.

553
00:53:19,309 --> 00:53:22,403
So, this isn't sanctioned.

554
00:53:26,449 --> 00:53:30,249
Give this to Clark, see what
he finds out, bring it home.

555
00:53:32,923 --> 00:53:34,322
Yes, sir.

556
00:53:40,431 --> 00:53:43,331
We never had this discussion.

557
00:53:43,331 --> 00:53:45,230
What discussion?

558
00:53:59,416 --> 00:54:00,849
Okay. Clark?

559
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:05,149
This is three days ago,
and it shows vehicles here...

560
00:54:05,149 --> 00:54:07,281
guards here and here.

561
00:54:07,281 --> 00:54:09,292
I oughta get one of those.

562
00:54:10,261 --> 00:54:15,027
The infrared satellite, in position
34 hours ago, took this photograph.

563
00:54:15,027 --> 00:54:18,499
It shows guards here and here.

564
00:54:18,499 --> 00:54:20,866
I don't even have E-mail.

565
00:54:22,406 --> 00:54:24,307
Two more at the checkpoint.

566
00:54:24,307 --> 00:54:29,039
Between two and five in the
barracks, two with the package.

567
00:54:29,039 --> 00:54:31,206
- Which we believe to be here.
- No problem.

568
00:54:31,206 --> 00:54:34,012
Give me a couple of guys,
a box of tranquilizer darts.

569
00:54:34,012 --> 00:54:36,087
If we're lucky,
we can be out in six minutes.

570
00:54:36,087 --> 00:54:39,088
- Actually, there is a problem.
- What's that?

571
00:54:39,088 --> 00:54:42,558
This is yesterday.
No guards visible at all.

572
00:54:44,230 --> 00:54:46,357
And why is that a problem,
Mr. Ryan?

573
00:54:46,357 --> 00:54:48,364
For two reasons.

574
00:54:48,364 --> 00:54:51,299
Either we can't see 'em,
which is bad...

575
00:54:51,299 --> 00:54:53,735
or, worse, they left,
and we're too late.

576
00:54:54,939 --> 00:54:56,908
Suit up.

577
00:54:56,908 --> 00:54:59,671
- What?
- You can't go dressed like that.

578
00:55:00,579 --> 00:55:03,571
No, no. Besides, I'm an analyst.

579
00:55:03,571 --> 00:55:05,776
I don't go on the,
you know, missions.

580
00:55:05,776 --> 00:55:09,548
Relax, 00 7, it's not a mission.
It's just a recce.

581
00:55:09,548 --> 00:55:13,524
Fine. Whatever you call it, I don't
do that. I just write reports.

582
00:55:13,524 --> 00:55:17,256
Okay. So write a report about it.
Suit up!

583
00:55:17,256 --> 00:55:18,763
Clark, no!

584
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:28,200
Cabot tells me you got my ticket
to the correspondents' dinner.

585
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:30,208
Have a good time?

586
00:55:31,812 --> 00:55:36,442
Never been to one of those.
Was actually looking forward to it.

587
00:55:55,202 --> 00:55:56,794
Clark, no.

588
00:55:56,794 --> 00:55:59,997
- I'm not going in there.
- Goddamn right, you're not.

589
00:55:59,997 --> 00:56:04,704
You'll stay and make sure nobody
steals my boat. Be right back.

590
00:58:02,533 --> 00:58:03,500
Damn.

591
00:59:39,665 --> 00:59:42,635
Oh, God. Immigration
didn't call you guys, huh?

592
00:59:47,307 --> 00:59:51,538
I'm sorry. You speak English?
I don't speak Ukrainian. You?

593
00:59:54,380 --> 00:59:57,440
I know this doesn't look good.
I'm an American citizen. My papers--

594
00:59:58,318 --> 01:00:00,843
Okay, no papers.

595
01:00:00,843 --> 01:00:03,548
Please, just put the gun down.
All right?

596
01:00:05,058 --> 01:00:08,118
The light.
Put the light down.

597
01:00:09,663 --> 01:00:12,723
Okay, okay. Take it easy.
I'll put the light down.

598
01:00:12,723 --> 01:00:15,394
Here we go.
I'm putting it down.

599
01:00:26,947 --> 01:00:28,005
Shoot him, Ryan.

600
01:00:29,850 --> 01:00:31,751
Shoot him.

601
01:00:36,657 --> 01:00:39,353
Shoot him before he figures out
what I'm saying.

602
01:00:46,801 --> 01:00:48,895
- Get their shoes.
- What?

603
01:00:49,938 --> 01:00:52,270
Tell them
to take their shoes off.

604
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,945
- You speak Ukranian.
- Yeah.

605
01:01:04,945 --> 01:01:06,453
You don't?

606
01:01:12,861 --> 01:01:15,193
<i>Whatever it is they were
spray-painting was big.</i>

607
01:01:16,632 --> 01:01:18,691
About the size of a fridge.

608
01:01:18,691 --> 01:01:21,965
The imprint it left was deep,
so we know three things--

609
01:01:21,965 --> 01:01:23,266
it was heavy...

610
01:01:23,266 --> 01:01:25,364
something was radioactive...

611
01:01:25,364 --> 01:01:26,874
and now it's gone.

612
01:01:28,678 --> 01:01:31,510
- One of them spoke English?
- South African.

613
01:01:31,510 --> 01:01:33,046
Okay, so the question is...

614
01:01:33,046 --> 01:01:35,275
what's a South African
doing in the Ukraine...

615
01:01:35,275 --> 01:01:38,752
with three Russian scientists
and a crate from Israel?

616
01:01:44,394 --> 01:01:46,294
Tell Cabot
I'll call him from Haifa.

617
01:01:47,063 --> 01:01:49,258
I have a feeling
you'd better hurry.

618
01:01:53,136 --> 01:01:56,231
<i>Most people believe
the 20th century was defined...</i>

619
01:01:56,231 --> 01:01:59,776
by the death struggle
of communism versus capitalism...

620
01:01:59,776 --> 01:02:03,108
and that fascism
was but a hiccup.

621
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:06,481
Today we know better.

622
01:02:08,218 --> 01:02:10,243
Communism was a fool's errand.

623
01:02:10,243 --> 01:02:13,687
The followers of Marx,
gone from this earth.

624
01:02:13,687 --> 01:02:17,352
But the followers of Hitler
abound and thrive.

625
01:02:18,229 --> 01:02:21,721
<i>Hitler, however,
had one great disadvantage.</i>

626
01:02:21,721 --> 01:02:25,529
<i>He lived in a time
when fascism, like a virus--</i>

627
01:02:25,529 --> 01:02:27,695
<i>like the AIDS virus--</i>

628
01:02:27,695 --> 01:02:32,334
<i>needed a strong host
in order to spread.</i>

629
01:02:32,334 --> 01:02:34,002
<i>Germany was that host.</i>

630
01:02:34,002 --> 01:02:37,638
But, strong as it was,
Germany could not prevail.

631
01:02:37,638 --> 01:02:40,444
<i>The world was too big.</i>

632
01:02:40,444 --> 01:02:43,577
<i>Fortunately,
the world has changed.</i>

633
01:02:44,688 --> 01:02:47,123
<i>Global communications,
cable TV...</i>

634
01:02:47,123 --> 01:02:49,125
<i>the Internet.</i>

635
01:02:49,125 --> 01:02:52,025
<i>Today the world is smaller...</i>

636
01:02:52,025 --> 01:02:56,396
<i>and a virus does not need
a strong host in order to spread.</i>

637
01:02:57,202 --> 01:02:58,601
This virus...

638
01:03:00,071 --> 01:03:01,561
is airborne.

639
01:03:04,010 --> 01:03:05,978
<i>One more thing.</i>

640
01:03:05,978 --> 01:03:08,512
<i>Let no man call us crazy.</i>

641
01:03:08,512 --> 01:03:12,014
<i>They called Hitler crazy,
but Hitler wasn't crazy.</i>

642
01:03:12,014 --> 01:03:13,846
<i>He was stupid.</i>

643
01:03:13,846 --> 01:03:16,580
<i>You don't fight
Russia and America.</i>

644
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:20,557
You get Russia and America
to fight each other...

645
01:03:20,557 --> 01:03:22,685
and destroy each other.

646
01:03:59,399 --> 01:04:00,764
So what'd you find?

647
01:04:00,764 --> 01:04:03,893
Ukraine doesn't have a thriving
export economy, but it's on-line.

648
01:04:03,893 --> 01:04:06,370
I pulled up every shipping manifest
for the past two weeks.

649
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:08,373
The only crate
the size of that imprint...

650
01:04:08,373 --> 01:04:10,910
was picked up at Kiev International
ten days ago...

651
01:04:10,910 --> 01:04:12,912
and flown to the Canary Islands.

652
01:04:12,912 --> 01:04:15,778
I can't find Cabot. The Air Force
has a nuclear assessment team.

653
01:04:15,778 --> 01:04:17,782
<i>Call them and tell them--</i>

654
01:04:17,782 --> 01:04:20,876
It got put on a cargo freighter
headed for the East Coast.

655
01:04:21,855 --> 01:04:23,914
<i>- What?
- Baltimore, Jack.</i>

656
01:04:23,914 --> 01:04:25,423
<i>It's coming here.</i>

657
01:04:34,035 --> 01:04:37,061
<i>It's another spectacular view
from the Budweiser blimp...</i>

658
01:04:37,061 --> 01:04:39,071
<i>as we count down to game time.</i>

659
01:04:39,071 --> 01:04:41,801
<i>We'll have all the rest
of the pregame festivities...</i>

660
01:04:41,801 --> 01:04:44,811
<i>as well as the arrival of the
nation's number-one football fan...</i>

661
01:04:44,811 --> 01:04:46,312
<i>in just a moment.</i>

662
01:04:47,082 --> 01:04:51,609
<i>Then conquer we must</i>

663
01:04:51,609 --> 01:04:56,418
<i>For our cause it is just</i>

664
01:04:56,418 --> 01:04:57,468
<i>And this be our motto</i>

665
01:05:02,197 --> 01:05:06,065
<i>In God is our trust</i>

666
01:05:06,065 --> 01:05:10,332
<i>And the star-spangled banner</i>

667
01:05:11,106 --> 01:05:12,006
<i>Forever shall wave</i>

668
01:05:20,616 --> 01:05:25,018
<i>O'er the land of the free</i>

669
01:05:26,988 --> 01:05:29,149
Then give me the duty officer!

670
01:05:29,149 --> 01:05:30,849
<i>And the home</i>

671
01:05:30,849 --> 01:05:31,569
<i>Of the</i>

672
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,512
<i>Brave</i>

673
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,804
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

674
01:05:47,804 --> 01:05:49,879
<i>the president
of the United States...</i>

675
01:05:49,879 --> 01:05:51,879
<i>Robert Fowler.</i>

676
01:05:56,619 --> 01:05:58,018
Show time.

677
01:06:29,370 --> 01:06:30,268
Shit!

678
01:06:36,809 --> 01:06:38,709
<i>Fifteen-yard penalty.</i>

679
01:06:38,709 --> 01:06:40,073
<i>First down.</i>

680
01:06:40,073 --> 01:06:41,408
That's the way!

681
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:50,548
Shit.

682
01:07:14,516 --> 01:07:15,414
Sir!

683
01:07:15,414 --> 01:07:16,814
Hello?

684
01:07:16,814 --> 01:07:18,385
Sir!

685
01:07:22,657 --> 01:07:23,715
Shit!

686
01:07:39,941 --> 01:07:40,999
Yeah? Cabot.

687
01:07:40,999 --> 01:07:42,303
It's Ryan.

688
01:07:44,546 --> 01:07:45,444
What?

689
01:07:45,444 --> 01:07:47,743
The bomb is in play!

690
01:07:47,743 --> 01:07:49,841
<i>Dillon's called the AFRA Tteam.</i>

691
01:07:49,841 --> 01:07:53,683
They're meeting me at the docks in
20 minutes to see if we can find it.

692
01:07:53,683 --> 01:07:55,154
Docks? What docks?

693
01:07:55,154 --> 01:07:57,282
<i>- Baltimore.
- You're breaking up.</i>

694
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,792
What did you say?

695
01:08:00,496 --> 01:08:02,555
I'm losing you.
I'll call you back--

696
01:08:02,555 --> 01:08:04,429
<i>Baltimore!</i>

697
01:08:06,703 --> 01:08:07,601
<i>Sir!</i>

698
01:08:33,897 --> 01:08:35,797
John! Reggie!

699
01:08:35,797 --> 01:08:37,834
- Let's go! Let's go!
- Excuse me! Excuse me!

700
01:08:37,834 --> 01:08:39,835
Let's go! Let's go!

701
01:08:42,473 --> 01:08:43,497
Step back!

702
01:08:49,012 --> 01:08:51,913
Go, go, go, go! Move! Move!

703
01:09:00,358 --> 01:09:02,519
- What's going on?
- Sir, stay down.

704
01:09:02,519 --> 01:09:04,857
The Russian scientists
have been working on a bomb.

705
01:09:04,857 --> 01:09:06,862
Nuclear. It arrived
in Baltimore this morning.

706
01:09:06,862 --> 01:09:09,728
- Get those people out of the stadium!
- We're on it! Stay down!

707
01:09:32,558 --> 01:09:35,891
<i>All we know is,
the president has been taken off--</i>

708
01:09:35,891 --> 01:09:37,894
- All set.
- Thanks,J.J.

709
01:10:25,446 --> 01:10:28,903
<i>Clearly something has happened
of tremendous proportion.</i>

710
01:10:28,903 --> 01:10:32,348
<i>We have no word yet
or confirmation as to what...</i>

711
01:10:32,348 --> 01:10:35,013
<i>but there is
an enormous cloud over--</i>

712
01:11:09,824 --> 01:11:11,553
Go, go, go!

713
01:11:12,661 --> 01:11:14,060
Come with me!

714
01:11:17,632 --> 01:11:19,293
Mr. President! Mr. President!

715
01:11:19,293 --> 01:11:20,891
Are you all right?

716
01:11:20,891 --> 01:11:23,334
He's stuck! He's stuck!
Get out of the way!

717
01:11:28,144 --> 01:11:30,135
Mr. President,
are you all right?

718
01:11:34,449 --> 01:11:37,907
Are you all right, Mr. President?
The marines will take you home, sir.

719
01:11:37,907 --> 01:11:39,816
I need your help, Danny.

720
01:11:39,816 --> 01:11:43,085
Alvarez, get me a stretcher!
Now!

721
01:11:45,628 --> 01:11:47,687
You got the stretcher?

722
01:11:54,303 --> 01:11:56,100
You got the stretcher?

723
01:11:56,100 --> 01:11:58,264
- No, I don't want one.
- Okay.

724
01:11:58,264 --> 01:11:59,842
Let's go, let's go!

725
01:12:00,877 --> 01:12:02,401
Let's go!

726
01:12:02,401 --> 01:12:03,570
Move it!

727
01:12:12,988 --> 01:12:14,717
Move it, move it!

728
01:12:21,131 --> 01:12:24,032
Go, go! Close the mouth!
Got 'em!

729
01:15:02,830 --> 01:15:04,559
Hey! It's Ryan!

730
01:15:04,559 --> 01:15:06,895
<i>-Jack, where are you?
- I don't know.</i>

731
01:15:06,895 --> 01:15:08,468
Somewhere outside Baltimore.

732
01:15:08,468 --> 01:15:11,561
<i>- Cabot got the president out.
- Where's the president now?</i>

733
01:15:11,561 --> 01:15:13,902
They're taking him airborne.
He's on NAOC.

734
01:15:13,902 --> 01:15:16,772
<i>- Why?
- They think it may be the Russians.</i>

735
01:15:18,412 --> 01:15:20,108
It wasn't the Russians.

736
01:15:20,108 --> 01:15:23,116
I gotta talk to Cabot. Can you
patch me through to the plane?

737
01:15:23,116 --> 01:15:24,310
<i>Cabot's not on the plane.</i>

738
01:15:24,310 --> 01:15:27,320
<i>We don't know where he is.
Can you call back in an hour?</i>

739
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,321
We don't have an hour!

740
01:15:29,321 --> 01:15:32,256
Fowler will want to show how tough
he is. He's gonna hit back, now!

741
01:15:33,694 --> 01:15:35,753
<i>Listen to me.</i>

742
01:15:35,753 --> 01:15:38,856
We must prove it wasn't the Russians
before he's convinced it is.

743
01:15:38,856 --> 01:15:42,630
<i>- Can you get back to Langley?
- There's no time!</i>

744
01:15:42,630 --> 01:15:44,568
There must be
a command post on site.

745
01:15:44,568 --> 01:15:46,504
The radiation assessment team--
where are they?

746
01:15:46,504 --> 01:15:47,609
<i>Stambler Tunnels,
south of the city.</i>

747
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,338
<i>Stambler Tunnels,
south of the city.</i>

748
01:15:50,245 --> 01:15:53,738
<i>The prevailing winds are blowing
the fallout from east to north.</i>

749
01:15:53,738 --> 01:15:56,147
<i>As long as you stay south,
you're okay.</i>

750
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:02,389
- Mr. President, are you all right?
- How the hell do you think I am?

751
01:16:02,389 --> 01:16:04,583
- How many casualties?
- We don't know.

752
01:16:04,583 --> 01:16:07,594
Cabot said it was Russian.
How did it get in there?

753
01:16:07,594 --> 01:16:10,791
We don't know. Radar didn't
pick it up, so it wasn't a missile.

754
01:16:10,791 --> 01:16:12,595
How is Cabot?
Where is he?

755
01:16:12,595 --> 01:16:14,135
I don't know.

756
01:16:14,135 --> 01:16:16,761
- Well, what do you know?
- I don't know!

757
01:16:16,761 --> 01:16:18,965
- All right.
- I don't know, for Christ's sake!

758
01:16:31,555 --> 01:16:34,456
General, Prozain and Kondor
are not on board.

759
01:16:37,393 --> 01:16:40,453
Mr. President, I recommend
that we move to DEFCON 2.

760
01:16:40,453 --> 01:16:42,190
Where's our intelligence?

761
01:16:42,190 --> 01:16:43,994
Russian air defenses have
moved to their highest level.

762
01:16:43,994 --> 01:16:47,298
Maybe they're afraid of an attack. I
can't get this goddamned chair to open!

763
01:16:47,298 --> 01:16:49,702
- Sir, DEFCON status?
- We're about to take off.

764
01:16:49,702 --> 01:16:52,969
- We don't know who did it.
- We think Russia's at high alert.

765
01:16:52,969 --> 01:16:55,544
- Excuse me. You think?
- Sir? DEFCON 2?

766
01:16:55,544 --> 01:16:57,374
We're groping in the dark--

767
01:16:57,374 --> 01:16:59,642
This is too much
goddamn bullshit!

768
01:17:01,953 --> 01:17:03,420
Not enough fact.

769
01:17:18,836 --> 01:17:22,328
<i>The blast crater is about 100,
maybe 150 yards wide...</i>

770
01:17:22,328 --> 01:17:25,034
<i>which suggests
a relatively low-yield device.</i>

771
01:17:25,034 --> 01:17:27,703
<i>Quite a bit smaller than,
say, the Hiroshima bomb.</i>

772
01:17:27,703 --> 01:17:32,408
<i>Maybe a quarter of a square mile
around the stadium is just gone.</i>

773
01:17:32,408 --> 01:17:33,917
<i>Beyond that, buildings remain...</i>

774
01:17:33,917 --> 01:17:36,749
<i>although heavily damaged
for another quarter mile or so.</i>

775
01:17:36,749 --> 01:17:39,847
<i>The damage appears to taper off
further away from ground zero.</i>

776
01:17:51,603 --> 01:17:54,231
<i>Herr Haft has left for America.</i>

777
01:17:54,231 --> 01:17:56,739
<i>And now we are counting on you.</i>

778
01:17:58,310 --> 01:18:02,542
I assure you,
I will earn every pfennig.

779
01:18:48,963 --> 01:18:53,331
The ash isn't radioactive, and winds
are blowing the fallout to sea.

780
01:18:53,331 --> 01:18:54,923
Jack Ryan, CIA.

781
01:18:54,923 --> 01:18:57,936
Lorna Shiro. You need to wait
outside with everybody else.

782
01:18:57,936 --> 01:19:00,973
I don't think so. I need to know
everything you know about the bomb.

783
01:19:00,973 --> 01:19:03,873
Look, pal, we're collecting samples
and analyzing the debris...

784
01:19:03,873 --> 01:19:07,004
so take a number, get in line,
and we'll have the report tomorrow.

785
01:19:07,004 --> 01:19:10,948
Captain, I don't have time for this.
Where did this bomb come from?

786
01:19:10,948 --> 01:19:13,952
I'll settle for where it didn't
come from, but I need to know now...

787
01:19:13,952 --> 01:19:16,455
otherwise there may not
be a tomorrow.

788
01:19:16,455 --> 01:19:19,254
Shit.
Wesson, where are you?

789
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,454
<i>About a quarter mile
from ground zero.</i>

790
01:19:21,454 --> 01:19:25,089
I think this is about
as far as we go.

791
01:19:25,089 --> 01:19:26,689
Our feet are sizzling.

792
01:19:26,689 --> 01:19:29,530
I'm getting rads here
nearly the limit of our gear.

793
01:19:29,530 --> 01:19:32,198
<i>Okay, cut the rover loose
and get the hell out of there.</i>

794
01:19:32,198 --> 01:19:33,569
Roger that.

795
01:19:43,752 --> 01:19:48,486
The crate the bomb was shipped in--
somebody signed for it at the port.

796
01:19:48,486 --> 01:19:50,991
Customs must have a database.
Get me a name.

797
01:19:50,991 --> 01:19:53,152
<i>- And where's Cabot?
- No one knows.</i>

798
01:19:53,152 --> 01:19:55,162
<i>We're checking the hospitals.</i>

799
01:19:55,162 --> 01:19:57,493
<i>- Have you tried Memorial?
- He wouldn't be there.</i>

800
01:19:57,493 --> 01:20:01,000
No, I mean, is it still--

801
01:20:03,405 --> 01:20:05,306
It's Cathy's hospital.

802
01:20:06,475 --> 01:20:09,740
<i>As far as I know it's still there.
But the phones are down.</i>

803
01:20:09,740 --> 01:20:12,541
Can you keep checking for me?
Thanks.

804
01:20:15,885 --> 01:20:17,785
<i>They could've launched
a cruise missile.</i>

805
01:20:17,785 --> 01:20:19,616
DSP sats might've missed it.

806
01:20:19,616 --> 01:20:22,851
- We don't know this is Russia.
- But we don't know it's not.

807
01:20:22,851 --> 01:20:25,861
If they were sending us a message,
like ''Stay out of Chechnya''...

808
01:20:25,861 --> 01:20:28,864
the whole point would be
for us to know it was them.

809
01:20:28,864 --> 01:20:32,696
Except that they could inspire the
confusion we're going through now.

810
01:20:32,696 --> 01:20:34,702
Mr. President, we're uplinked.

811
01:20:38,141 --> 01:20:40,371
President Nemerov,
a short time ago...

812
01:20:40,371 --> 01:20:44,436
there was a major nuclear event
on the Eastern Seaboard of the US.

813
01:20:44,436 --> 01:20:46,448
Loss of life is severe.

814
01:20:46,448 --> 01:20:49,018
- It was no accident.
- It was not an accident.

815
01:20:49,018 --> 01:20:52,611
We don't yet know where
it came from, we don't--

816
01:20:52,611 --> 01:20:57,127
We have not yet ascertained
the source of this weapon.

817
01:20:57,127 --> 01:20:58,490
Rest assured--

818
01:21:16,895 --> 01:21:19,455
Whoa, that was a little fast.

819
01:21:19,455 --> 01:21:22,556
''Please accept the deepest
sympathies of the Russian people.

820
01:21:22,556 --> 01:21:26,398
If it was deliberate,
this is a crime without precedent.

821
01:21:26,398 --> 01:21:29,498
What madman would do such a thing,
and for what purpose?

822
01:21:29,498 --> 01:21:33,067
You must believe Russia had nothing
to do with this infamous act.''

823
01:21:33,067 --> 01:21:36,307
It's canned.
They prepared that in advance.

824
01:21:37,716 --> 01:21:42,153
President Nemerov, we have no reason
to suspect Russian involvement...

825
01:21:42,153 --> 01:21:43,915
at this time.

826
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:47,052
TAO, EW. I'm picking up
intermittent radar bearing 020.

827
01:22:48,188 --> 01:22:49,086
Where?

828
01:22:52,860 --> 01:22:54,293
Now it's gone.

829
01:23:02,237 --> 01:23:04,535
- There! It's a weak signal.
- Low on the horizon.

830
01:23:04,535 --> 01:23:06,766
TAO, AIR SUP.
Inbound contact!

831
01:23:12,214 --> 01:23:14,114
Multiples on the same bearing!

832
01:23:16,218 --> 01:23:18,242
- Vampire! Vampire!
- Fast movers inbound!

833
01:23:18,242 --> 01:23:21,015
I got seven, eight--
nine of them!

834
01:23:47,317 --> 01:23:49,342
The missiles came
from Russian aircraft.

835
01:23:49,342 --> 01:23:52,943
Grennel thinks he can save the ship,
but flight ops are definitely out.

836
01:24:01,498 --> 01:24:03,728
''...until we investigate
all possibilities.''

837
01:24:03,728 --> 01:24:06,199
Like you did in Chechnya?

838
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:09,636
Mr. President, who is in control
of your armed forces?

839
01:24:25,188 --> 01:24:26,246
Mr. President...

840
01:24:28,258 --> 01:24:31,819
we are now at a de facto
state of war with the Russians.

841
01:24:37,835 --> 01:24:39,826
John Clark
was in Haifa yesterday.

842
01:24:39,826 --> 01:24:43,304
I don't know where he is today,
but he may have something. Find him.

843
01:24:43,304 --> 01:24:44,897
Check out
that gadolinium reading.

844
01:24:44,897 --> 01:24:47,705
Yeah, the mass fraction is huge.

845
01:24:47,705 --> 01:24:50,281
Okay, connect me to Dillon.
I'll hold.

846
01:24:50,281 --> 01:24:52,543
There it is.

847
01:24:54,219 --> 01:24:57,086
- Savannah River.
- Oh, yeah.

848
01:24:57,888 --> 01:25:00,288
-''Oh, yeah'' what?
-Always had that gadolinium problem.

849
01:25:00,288 --> 01:25:02,416
Hanford does it another way.

850
01:25:02,416 --> 01:25:04,756
They always generate
too much promethium.

851
01:25:04,756 --> 01:25:07,457
Hold on. Can you
translate that into English?

852
01:25:09,201 --> 01:25:12,500
This plutonium came from
the DOE plant at Savannah River...

853
01:25:12,500 --> 01:25:15,198
February of'68,
from ''K'' reactor.

854
01:25:15,198 --> 01:25:17,502
You can even tell
which part of''K'' reactor.

855
01:25:17,502 --> 01:25:19,543
Wait, this is our plutonium?

856
01:25:19,543 --> 01:25:22,135
Made in the USA.

857
01:25:24,083 --> 01:25:25,607
You gotta find Cabot.

858
01:25:33,191 --> 01:25:35,751
Are you advocating
we launch a first strike?

859
01:25:35,751 --> 01:25:38,523
It is not a first strike!

860
01:25:38,523 --> 01:25:41,566
There's already been a first strike,
and a second!

861
01:25:41,566 --> 01:25:44,033
- Don't you get it?
- No, I don't!

862
01:25:44,033 --> 01:25:47,334
I don't understand why we have
to nuke them! It's not reasonable!

863
01:25:47,334 --> 01:25:50,238
Sidney, goddamn it!

864
01:25:50,238 --> 01:25:53,005
They practically sank
an aircraft carrier!

865
01:25:53,005 --> 01:25:55,012
Their missile silos are hot.

866
01:25:55,012 --> 01:25:57,015
We're getting nothing
but bullshit from Nemerov.

867
01:25:57,015 --> 01:25:59,711
And let's not forget
how this thing started.

868
01:25:59,711 --> 01:26:02,084
They tried to kill me!
Remember?

869
01:26:02,084 --> 01:26:05,487
So don't fucking tell me
to be reasonable.

870
01:26:47,135 --> 01:26:48,033
Sir?

871
01:26:50,738 --> 01:26:52,137
Sir.

872
01:26:58,246 --> 01:26:59,645
What?

873
01:27:00,849 --> 01:27:01,907
The president.

874
01:27:03,552 --> 01:27:04,849
The president's fine.

875
01:27:04,849 --> 01:27:06,353
He's fine.

876
01:27:08,524 --> 01:27:11,288
The bomb.
The plutonium was--

877
01:27:11,288 --> 01:27:13,121
- Wife.
- What?

878
01:27:14,362 --> 01:27:15,420
Wife.

879
01:27:15,420 --> 01:27:16,929
Your wife.

880
01:27:16,929 --> 01:27:19,693
I'm sure she's fine.
She's in DC.

881
01:27:19,693 --> 01:27:22,032
The blast radius wasn't that--

882
01:27:23,772 --> 01:27:24,932
wasn't that wide.

883
01:27:27,610 --> 01:27:28,975
Here.

884
01:27:30,079 --> 01:27:32,047
Sir, now listen to me.

885
01:27:32,948 --> 01:27:36,714
The plutonium was ours.

886
01:27:36,714 --> 01:27:40,051
John Clark's in Haifa right now
trying to find the arms dealer.

887
01:27:40,051 --> 01:27:42,056
I can't get a hold of him...

888
01:27:42,826 --> 01:27:45,225
and I don't know what to do.

889
01:27:48,831 --> 01:27:50,560
Girlfriend.

890
01:27:55,005 --> 01:27:56,905
She works in Baltimore, so...

891
01:27:58,174 --> 01:27:59,971
I don't know.

892
01:28:03,213 --> 01:28:04,646
Spinnaker.

893
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:05,737
What?

894
01:28:05,737 --> 01:28:07,908
Spinnaker.

895
01:28:12,189 --> 01:28:13,986
Sir?

896
01:28:15,359 --> 01:28:16,758
Bill?

897
01:28:49,194 --> 01:28:52,924
Yeah,Jack, just got in. We found
the receiver address for the crate.

898
01:28:52,924 --> 01:28:55,498
<i>Yeah, Port of Baltimore.
Can you get to the docks?</i>

899
01:28:55,498 --> 01:28:56,498
Yeah.

900
01:28:56,498 --> 01:29:01,005
Find the Trans-Con warehouse.
The name on the manifest is Mason.

901
01:29:01,773 --> 01:29:03,673
Sorry, I need this truck.

902
01:29:38,543 --> 01:29:39,942
Come on.

903
01:30:17,350 --> 01:30:18,749
Shit.

904
01:30:21,721 --> 01:30:23,120
Come on!

905
01:31:24,452 --> 01:31:26,977
- We've come up with an alternative.
- We'll counterforce.

906
01:31:28,089 --> 01:31:29,989
A conventional attack
on the Russian air base...

907
01:31:29,989 --> 01:31:31,582
where the carrier attack
originated.

908
01:31:31,582 --> 01:31:34,744
It's what we're looking for--
a measured response.

909
01:31:34,744 --> 01:31:35,496
None nuclear.

910
01:31:35,496 --> 01:31:38,294
- Is it strong enough?
- Smart bombs and F-16s.

911
01:31:38,294 --> 01:31:39,697
Pretty goddamn strong.

912
01:31:39,697 --> 01:31:42,702
Can't afford for them
to see us as weak.

913
01:31:42,702 --> 01:31:46,797
They've gotta know we have the guts
to take it to the next level.

914
01:31:47,609 --> 01:31:49,601
I think they'll
get that message.

915
01:31:54,116 --> 01:31:55,174
Hit 'em.

916
01:32:08,865 --> 01:32:12,323
<i>Eagle's Nest, this is Eagle One.
We have target acquired.</i>

917
01:32:12,323 --> 01:32:13,492
<i>Target is lit.</i>

918
01:32:14,737 --> 01:32:16,136
<i>Good-bye.</i>

919
01:33:06,123 --> 01:33:10,025
Everyone, can I have your attention?
The generator has gone out.

920
01:33:10,025 --> 01:33:14,588
I don't want anyone to move because
there's broken glass everywhere.

921
01:33:14,588 --> 01:33:16,258
We'll get back to you--

922
01:33:16,258 --> 01:33:20,270
Good. Okay, stay where you are.
We're going to get you one by one.

923
01:33:33,819 --> 01:33:35,719
Sir, can you hear me?

924
01:33:36,488 --> 01:33:38,718
Can you feel
your arms and legs?

925
01:33:41,159 --> 01:33:43,093
We're gonna take care of you.

926
01:33:43,093 --> 01:33:44,594
What do you got?

927
01:33:45,698 --> 01:33:48,326
What do we do with the ones
we know won't make it?

928
01:33:50,203 --> 01:33:51,602
Whatever we can.

929
01:33:59,044 --> 01:34:01,012
What?

930
01:34:01,012 --> 01:34:03,014
Bill Cabot died.

931
01:34:07,387 --> 01:34:09,287
I'm really sorry.

932
01:34:11,658 --> 01:34:13,558
This can't be happening.

933
01:34:29,809 --> 01:34:32,209
Sir, you have a call
from Langley.

934
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:35,279
Thank you.

935
01:34:38,085 --> 01:34:40,349
<i>- Becker.
- This is Jack Ryan, Russian desk.</i>

936
01:34:40,349 --> 01:34:42,820
Oh, great.
The Nemerov apologist.

937
01:34:44,491 --> 01:34:48,052
Sir, this bomb was not Nemerov.
I know this guy.

938
01:34:48,052 --> 01:34:50,687
That's what you said
after Grozny, Mr. Ryan.

939
01:34:50,687 --> 01:34:53,290
<i>- Put it in your report.
- The plutonium came from--</i>

940
01:35:07,614 --> 01:35:11,483
Seems unusual to find radiation
poisoning all the way out here.

941
01:35:11,483 --> 01:35:13,816
I have never myself
seen such a thing.

942
01:35:13,816 --> 01:35:17,483
That is why we published the case
on the Internet-- to seek help.

943
01:35:18,593 --> 01:35:20,493
How did he say it happened?

944
01:35:20,493 --> 01:35:22,495
He will not talk about it.

945
01:35:31,807 --> 01:35:34,707
Was anyone else exposed to
the materials that made you sick?

946
01:35:41,883 --> 01:35:44,785
Mr. Ghazi, I'm not the police.

947
01:35:46,022 --> 01:35:50,288
I'm a physician. Anything you
say to me stays between us.

948
01:35:56,799 --> 01:35:59,097
My friend and I...

949
01:35:59,097 --> 01:36:01,033
find bomb.

950
01:36:02,672 --> 01:36:04,401
We sell...

951
01:36:05,509 --> 01:36:07,409
to man who buys such things.

952
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:12,379
Was it this man?

953
01:36:19,356 --> 01:36:22,257
Other people may have come
in contact with that bomb.

954
01:36:37,408 --> 01:36:38,807
I am...

955
01:36:39,911 --> 01:36:41,673
going to die...

956
01:36:41,673 --> 01:36:42,836
yes?

957
01:36:47,717 --> 01:36:49,116
Yes.

958
01:37:01,833 --> 01:37:03,061
His name...

959
01:37:04,268 --> 01:37:05,667
is Olson.

960
01:37:08,172 --> 01:37:11,005
He lives in Damascus.

961
01:37:29,293 --> 01:37:31,352
Oh, yeah.
We're getting it all.

962
01:38:09,768 --> 01:38:12,862
Mr. President, we need you
to initiate SNAPCOUNT.

963
01:38:14,641 --> 01:38:16,040
What happens then?

964
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:18,770
We prepare to take out
their land-based missiles...

965
01:38:18,770 --> 01:38:20,812
with a massive nuclear strike...

966
01:38:20,812 --> 01:38:23,279
find and kill their subs...

967
01:38:23,279 --> 01:38:25,714
knock out whatever planes
they have on the ground...

968
01:38:25,714 --> 01:38:29,719
and mobilize to destroy the ones
they already have in the air.

969
01:38:31,324 --> 01:38:33,121
What are our chances?

970
01:38:34,027 --> 01:38:35,426
David?

971
01:38:37,964 --> 01:38:39,955
Odds are...

972
01:38:39,955 --> 01:38:41,966
we leave Nemerov
in a pretty pickle.

973
01:38:41,966 --> 01:38:45,799
He'll be left with, at best,
a few hundred nukes--

974
01:38:45,799 --> 01:38:48,340
the ones we can't find.

975
01:38:48,340 --> 01:38:53,038
Mostly the smaller, more mobile,
less-accurate kind.

976
01:38:53,038 --> 01:38:55,614
All he can do with those
is target our cities.

977
01:38:55,614 --> 01:38:57,876
But he knows
to an absolute certainty...

978
01:38:58,651 --> 01:39:00,881
that we will respond
against his cities.

979
01:39:06,894 --> 01:39:10,295
I spent my entire adult life
wanting to be president.

980
01:39:13,534 --> 01:39:15,434
This is my presidency.

981
01:39:17,571 --> 01:39:19,801
Sir, I believe
he'll keep his 300 nukes.

982
01:39:19,801 --> 01:39:22,604
It's still a credible deterrent
against some future aggressor.

983
01:39:22,604 --> 01:39:25,612
He'll push back from the table
and call it a night.

984
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:31,479
I'm giving the order
for SNAPCOUNT.

985
01:39:32,419 --> 01:39:34,148
Maximum readiness.

986
01:39:42,697 --> 01:39:44,995
Jack, we're in Olson's files.

987
01:39:44,995 --> 01:39:48,536
He shows wire payments of $45
million from someone named Dressler.

988
01:39:48,536 --> 01:39:51,970
Dillon, run Dressler.
Find out who he is.

989
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:54,975
<i>-Jack, I want you out of there.
- I'm at the docks. Somebody's here.</i>

990
01:39:54,975 --> 01:39:57,511
- Try to find the name ''Dressler.''
- No!Jack, get out of there.

991
01:39:57,511 --> 01:40:00,480
Dillon, call the Baltimore PD,
give them the address. Hurry.

992
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:03,483
-Jack, wait for the cops.
- I'll call you back.

993
01:41:03,448 --> 01:41:04,380
Wait.

994
01:41:28,172 --> 01:41:30,732
Who's Dressler? Huh?

995
01:41:34,078 --> 01:41:36,673
Where is he, goddamn it?

996
01:41:36,673 --> 01:41:39,273
Where is Dressler?

997
01:41:39,273 --> 01:41:40,283
Police!

998
01:41:40,283 --> 01:41:41,910
Get your hands up!

999
01:41:41,910 --> 01:41:44,283
- Where's Dressler?
- Are you Jack Ryan?

1000
01:41:44,283 --> 01:41:47,586
- Where's Dressler? Tell me!
- Let him go.

1001
01:41:48,393 --> 01:41:50,418
- Let him go.
- Where's Dressler?

1002
01:41:50,418 --> 01:41:51,928
Where is he?

1003
01:41:55,534 --> 01:41:58,196
Langley said you might
need some help.

1004
01:41:58,196 --> 01:42:00,794
I gotta get to the Pentagon.

1005
01:42:00,794 --> 01:42:02,806
I think I can
help you with that.

1006
01:42:44,084 --> 01:42:46,109
The Russians
are scrambling their fighters.

1007
01:42:46,109 --> 01:42:48,154
We are out of time.

1008
01:42:51,391 --> 01:42:54,019
- He has a heart condition.
- Get a doctor.

1009
01:42:54,019 --> 01:42:56,322
- Mr. President.
- David, where's your nitro?

1010
01:42:56,322 --> 01:42:58,898
- I said get a doctor in here!
- Mr. President.

1011
01:42:59,667 --> 01:43:02,227
- Take him to my quarters.
- Bring him the launch codes.

1012
01:43:20,722 --> 01:43:23,884
<i>Okay, Dressler's an Austrian
manufacturer, a billionaire.</i>

1013
01:43:23,884 --> 01:43:25,891
His father was executed
at Nuremberg.

1014
01:43:25,891 --> 01:43:28,894
Five years ago he bought himself
a seat in parliament.

1015
01:43:28,894 --> 01:43:31,396
<i>Then he got himself booted out for
saying nice things about the Nazis.</i>

1016
01:43:31,396 --> 01:43:33,161
Get me the president.

1017
01:43:33,161 --> 01:43:35,168
<i>- I can't.
- Come on! Get me through!</i>

1018
01:43:35,168 --> 01:43:37,568
They're into SNAPCOUNT.
There's no way in.

1019
01:43:37,568 --> 01:43:38,730
Bullshit!

1020
01:44:14,043 --> 01:44:16,307
- I can do that for you.
- No, it's fine.

1021
01:44:16,307 --> 01:44:20,280
- Got some dirt on the card.
- May I see that card, sir?

1022
01:44:20,280 --> 01:44:23,717
We're on a high alert.
Put the card down, please.

1023
01:44:23,717 --> 01:44:25,549
- Back off.
- I am ordering you--

1024
01:44:25,549 --> 01:44:28,056
- Hold on.
- Take a step back, now!

1025
01:44:28,056 --> 01:44:31,558
I am ordering you to take
a step back immediately, sir.

1026
01:44:43,373 --> 01:44:46,433
General, there's a Dr. Ryan
from the CIA.

1027
01:44:46,433 --> 01:44:49,307
He wants to enter NMCC.
He's unescorted, sir.

1028
01:44:49,307 --> 01:44:51,506
- What's he want?
- You, sir.

1029
01:44:51,506 --> 01:44:53,845
Sir, my name is Jack Ryan.

1030
01:44:53,845 --> 01:44:55,852
I have an urgent message
from Director Cabot...

1031
01:44:55,852 --> 01:44:57,854
that I need to transmit
over the hot line immediately.

1032
01:44:57,854 --> 01:45:00,447
- What's your authorization?
- I don't have an authorization.

1033
01:45:00,447 --> 01:45:03,049
- Then where's Cabot?
- Cabot's dead, sir.

1034
01:45:03,049 --> 01:45:05,993
I just need to get
this information sent. Please.

1035
01:45:05,993 --> 01:45:08,495
Not without authorization.
Get him out of here.

1036
01:45:08,495 --> 01:45:10,156
Wait a minute! General!

1037
01:45:10,156 --> 01:45:13,930
The president's basing his decisions
on some really bad information...

1038
01:45:13,930 --> 01:45:15,937
and if you shut me out...

1039
01:45:15,937 --> 01:45:18,940
your family and my family
and 25 million other families...

1040
01:45:18,940 --> 01:45:21,636
will be dead in 30 minutes!

1041
01:45:27,250 --> 01:45:29,811
My orders are to get
the right information...

1042
01:45:29,811 --> 01:45:32,116
to the people
who make the decisions.

1043
01:45:32,116 --> 01:45:35,488
I just need to send
some information.

1044
01:45:36,894 --> 01:45:39,555
What makes you think the president
will even listen to you?

1045
01:45:43,400 --> 01:45:45,527
He doesn't have to.

1046
01:46:10,629 --> 01:46:13,062
You have about a minute for
the launch sequence to process...

1047
01:46:13,062 --> 01:46:14,859
after you give the order.

1048
01:46:14,859 --> 01:46:18,367
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed.

1049
01:46:24,143 --> 01:46:25,701
Mine is the--

1050
01:46:26,478 --> 01:46:27,911
My number is the...

1051
01:46:28,947 --> 01:46:31,916
third number down
from the top.

1052
01:46:32,685 --> 01:46:34,744
Your order, sir?

1053
01:46:34,744 --> 01:46:36,115
Strike.

1054
01:46:36,115 --> 01:46:37,280
I'm sorry, sir?

1055
01:46:37,280 --> 01:46:39,984
I give the order to strike.

1056
01:46:39,984 --> 01:46:43,654
Under the two-man rule, the order
to strike must now be confirmed.

1057
01:46:46,331 --> 01:46:48,231
Bob, for the love of God--

1058
01:46:49,101 --> 01:46:51,035
Just do it.

1059
01:46:55,975 --> 01:46:59,536
Sidney Owens, Secretary of State.
It's the fourth number down.

1060
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:12,991
The order to strike has now been
confirmed by the two-man rule.

1061
01:47:12,991 --> 01:47:16,495
NMCC, this is Lasseter.
The strike order has been confirmed.

1062
01:47:16,495 --> 01:47:18,894
-Start the sequence.
-We've got activity on the hot line.

1063
01:47:19,666 --> 01:47:23,102
- They've had their chance.
- Somebody's talking to the Kremlin.

1064
01:47:32,546 --> 01:47:35,071
As you can imagine...

1065
01:47:35,071 --> 01:47:37,150
there has been
much confusion here...

1066
01:47:37,150 --> 01:47:39,378
and fear.

1067
01:47:39,378 --> 01:47:42,820
But we know the weapon
was not Russian.

1068
01:47:42,820 --> 01:47:46,189
''We know the weapon was not Russian.
Repeat. The weapon was not Russian.''

1069
01:47:46,189 --> 01:47:48,194
What the hell is going on?

1070
01:47:58,439 --> 01:48:00,271
Who are we talking to?

1071
01:48:03,278 --> 01:48:07,544
Ryan. I met you in Moscow
with Bill Cabot.

1072
01:48:07,544 --> 01:48:09,549
He died today in Baltimore.

1073
01:48:09,549 --> 01:48:10,640
Cut him off.

1074
01:48:10,640 --> 01:48:12,811
- We can't.
- Launch sequence has begun.

1075
01:48:12,811 --> 01:48:15,788
Two months ago,
a neo-fascist named Dressler...

1076
01:48:15,788 --> 01:48:18,383
bought an A-bomb
on the black market.

1077
01:48:18,383 --> 01:48:22,521
- Cut him off.
- You can't. That's the whole idea.

1078
01:48:22,521 --> 01:48:24,497
Then get somebody to stop him.

1079
01:48:24,497 --> 01:48:26,829
He paid three disaffected
Russian scientists...

1080
01:48:26,829 --> 01:48:28,960
''to make the bomb active.

1081
01:48:28,960 --> 01:48:32,062
He shipped it to the US,
where a man named Mason...''

1082
01:48:32,062 --> 01:48:34,643
was hired to deliver the bomb
to the target...

1083
01:48:34,643 --> 01:48:36,871
and set our countries
on a collision course.

1084
01:48:53,130 --> 01:48:55,223
What are you asking of me?

1085
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:06,039
Back down.

1086
01:49:10,380 --> 01:49:13,781
What guarantee do I have that
President Fowler will follow suit?

1087
01:49:15,552 --> 01:49:16,450
None.

1088
01:49:28,166 --> 01:49:29,861
Sir, I know you.

1089
01:49:29,861 --> 01:49:32,936
I know you had nothing to do
with the Baltimore bomb...

1090
01:49:32,936 --> 01:49:34,936
and you sure as hell
know you didn't.

1091
01:49:34,936 --> 01:49:37,233
But you're still about to launch
a nuclear strike against us.

1092
01:49:37,233 --> 01:49:39,502
- Yes, sir.
- It's no longer about Baltimore.

1093
01:49:39,502 --> 01:49:42,705
- Now it's about our fears.
- That's all, Dr. Ryan.

1094
01:49:42,705 --> 01:49:45,374
- Move away from the keyboard. Sergeant...
- Fear of being weak, of mistakes.

1095
01:49:45,374 --> 01:49:49,385
...move away from the keyboard. Fear of the other 
guy that built these bombs in the first place!

1096
01:49:52,991 --> 01:49:54,481
It stopped.

1097
01:50:19,184 --> 01:50:21,118
Thirty seconds to launch.

1098
01:50:21,118 --> 01:50:23,450
Oh, my God.
Mr. President.

1099
01:50:33,233 --> 01:50:36,532
We will maintain our defensive alert
for the moment...

1100
01:50:36,532 --> 01:50:39,502
but our offensive forces
are withdrawn.

1101
01:50:39,502 --> 01:50:42,369
''If you match our move, I propose
a phased mutual stand-down...

1102
01:50:42,369 --> 01:50:44,374
over the next five hours.''

1103
01:50:46,345 --> 01:50:48,405
Stop the launch sequence.

1104
01:50:48,405 --> 01:50:50,244
Lasseter here.
Flash override.

1105
01:50:50,244 --> 01:50:52,443
Stop the sequence.
Stop the sequence.

1106
01:50:53,486 --> 01:50:56,148
Order the planes to stand down.
Take us to DEFCON 3.

1107
01:50:57,257 --> 01:51:00,658
And would somebody ask Mr. Ryan
if I can use the phone now?

1108
01:51:31,092 --> 01:51:33,151
You're still here.

1109
01:54:44,990 --> 01:54:46,890
There is no more fitting memorial...

1110
01:54:46,890 --> 01:54:49,620
for those who perished
in this tragedy...

1111
01:54:49,620 --> 01:54:51,923
than the steps
we have taken this week...

1112
01:54:51,923 --> 01:54:54,192
toward a multinational campaign...

1113
01:54:54,192 --> 01:54:57,895
to root out and eliminate
weapons of mass destruction.

1114
01:54:59,806 --> 01:55:01,637
We embark upon this course...

1115
01:55:01,637 --> 01:55:05,108
<i>because we have finally learned,
at far too great a cost...</i>

1116
01:55:05,108 --> 01:55:08,738
<i>that if the most powerful weapons
ever created are unleashed...</i>

1117
01:55:08,738 --> 01:55:12,840
<i>they will be fired not in anger,
but in fear.</i>

1118
01:55:12,840 --> 01:55:14,419
Dr. Ryan.

1119
01:55:15,689 --> 01:55:16,917
Mr. Grushkov.

1120
01:55:17,924 --> 01:55:21,621
It is a lovely day.

1121
01:55:23,463 --> 01:55:25,454
Yeah.

1122
01:55:25,454 --> 01:55:27,965
- Oh, I'm sorry. This is--
- Dr. Muller.

1123
01:55:29,035 --> 01:55:30,297
How do you do?

1124
01:55:31,338 --> 01:55:32,738
Nice to meet you.

1125
01:55:34,775 --> 01:55:37,676
Why am I not surprised
that you know her name?

1126
01:55:39,847 --> 01:55:43,179
Our friend William
thought I was a spy.

1127
01:55:43,179 --> 01:55:46,013
Of course,
he could never prove it.

1128
01:55:48,188 --> 01:55:50,089
He never told me
you were friends.

1129
01:55:51,192 --> 01:55:53,660
Perhaps he didn't know you
well enough.

1130
01:55:56,163 --> 01:55:59,098
Cabot did tell me
he had a source in Russia.

1131
01:56:01,202 --> 01:56:03,466
To keep the back channels open?

1132
01:56:05,239 --> 01:56:07,435
In hopes of
staving off disaster.

1133
01:56:07,435 --> 01:56:12,536
<i>President Kennedy said,
''Our most basic common link...</i>

1134
01:56:12,536 --> 01:56:15,707
<i>is that we all inhabit
this small planet.</i>

1135
01:56:17,351 --> 01:56:19,410
<i>We all breathe the same air.</i>

1136
01:56:20,655 --> 01:56:23,181
<i>We all cherish...</i>

1137
01:56:23,181 --> 01:56:25,283
<i>our children's future.</i>

1138
01:56:25,283 --> 01:56:27,988
<i>And we are all mortal. ''</i>

1139
01:56:29,231 --> 01:56:31,756
I will miss...

1140
01:56:31,756 --> 01:56:34,631
so very much
talking to William.

1141
01:56:36,338 --> 01:56:37,862
Me too.

1142
01:56:38,740 --> 01:56:40,265
Perhaps...

1143
01:56:40,265 --> 01:56:42,139
from time to time...

1144
01:56:42,139 --> 01:56:44,145
you and I can talk.

1145
01:56:45,281 --> 01:56:46,578
I'd like that.

1146
01:56:50,385 --> 01:56:51,716
What is this?

1147
01:56:52,821 --> 01:56:54,721
A modest gift...

1148
01:56:54,721 --> 01:56:56,758
for your engagement.

1149
01:56:58,995 --> 01:57:01,190
He just asked me this morning.

1150
01:57:01,190 --> 01:57:03,197
We haven't told anybody about--

1151
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,694
How did you...
How could you possibly know?
