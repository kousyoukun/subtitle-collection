1
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:24,190
- You sure it's the Russians?
- 100%, sir.

2
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:28,656
Submarine launched 12 to 15
megatons. They went to strike status.

3
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:31,694
The Roosevelt's splashed
six incoming cruise missiles.

4
00:05:31,898 --> 00:05:35,925
The Russians are moving west.
Our Berlin brigade are outnumbered.

5
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,806
Sir, we've got a launch from Alyesk,
Central Russia.

6
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,067
What the hell is in Alyesk?

7
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:48,907
SS-18 ICBMs. Probable targets:
New York, Washington, here.

8
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:51,675
- How good is this ceiling?
- Anything but a direct hit.

9
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:56,184
Satellites confirm birds in the air,
first impact estimated 25 minutes.

10
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,414
- Is that accurate?
- It's accurate.

11
00:05:58,625 --> 00:06:01,753
- I advise we go to DEFCON-1.
- Get President Zorkin on the hotline.

12
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,419
Zorkin is missing. We have reports
of a coup in Moscow.

13
00:06:05,632 --> 00:06:08,465
General Bulgakov
is calling the shots now.

14
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,692
Who the hell is Bulgakov?

15
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:13,565
The asshole who wanted
to use nukes in Chechnya.

16
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,313
Sir, DEFCON-1. We're out of time.

17
00:06:37,196 --> 00:06:38,493
Do it.

18
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,630
Mr President.

19
00:06:42,869 --> 00:06:47,203
It'll take a minute for the launch
to process after you give the order.

20
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:50,706
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed.

21
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,174
My ID number is fifth from the top.

22
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:00,947
- Sir, it's your wife on 2104.
- Thank you.

23
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,622
- Yeah.
- The order must be confirmed

24
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:08,794
- by someone on the approved list.
- Shit.

25
00:07:09,295 --> 00:07:11,490
Gene Revell,
National Security Advisor.

26
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:15,259
Is it black tie? OK. I'm on my way.

27
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,162
Can we...

28
00:07:21,407 --> 00:07:23,375
...finish this up some other time?

29
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:31,014
No.

30
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,154
We've got to update these fire drills,
Billy.

31
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:39,450
If the shit ever hits the fan,
I'm not going underground.

32
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,025
It's a goddamn tomb down there.

33
00:07:42,228 --> 00:07:46,221
We have to choose someone else to
face off against besides the Russians.

34
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:50,960
Really? Let's see. Who else has
27,000 nukes for us to worry about?

35
00:07:51,204 --> 00:07:53,729
It's the guy with one I'm worried about.

36
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:56,339
I have to send some folks to Russia,

37
00:07:56,542 --> 00:08:00,603
inspect their nuclear decommissioning
facility at Armazas.

38
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:03,213
- Arzamas.
- Yeah, whatever.

39
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:07,284
- Someone from your staff should go.
- I'll go.

40
00:08:08,087 --> 00:08:11,921
- Billy, send staff.
- I want to go.

41
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,225
OK.

42
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:19,524
Don't underestimate Zorkin. Between
his economy, crime, Chechnya...

43
00:08:19,732 --> 00:08:23,099
- His liver.
- What's left of it. How is he?

44
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:27,739
He's scheduled a press conference
for today, so we know he can sit up.

45
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,473
Chechnya is part of Russia.

46
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,011
Only criminals and their friends
in the West who wish it to be separate.

47
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:46,589
Mr President, if you will kindly
come back...

48
00:08:49,662 --> 00:08:51,721
Do you guys see what I see?

49
00:08:53,099 --> 00:08:56,193
- His jacket?
- He used to be able to button it up.

50
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:58,233
He's getting fat.

51
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,804
I know how he feels.
Oh, wow. Look at that.

52
00:09:02,008 --> 00:09:03,635
Maybe it's not the same jacket.

53
00:09:03,843 --> 00:09:07,802
Yeah, it has shiny sleeves. He wore it
the last time he got out of the hospital.

54
00:09:08,014 --> 00:09:11,541
- He's off the diet.
- And off the wagon. He slurred...

55
00:09:13,286 --> 00:09:17,120
That must be why Cherlinski is there,
to keep him off the sauce.

56
00:09:17,323 --> 00:09:18,620
Where's Cherlinski?

57
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:23,091
Next to... What's her name?
The chick with the brown hair.

58
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:26,265
- Elena Rishkov.
- That is not Cherlinski.

59
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,232
Bzz! Busted. It's Cherlinski.

60
00:09:29,469 --> 00:09:31,664
You're thinking Cherpitski. It ain't him.

61
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,964
- I know. It's Cherlinski.
- No, it's not. Trust me.

62
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:39,577
He's next to Elena Rishkov. He was
banging her at the Geneva summit.

63
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:42,748
Cherlinski was not at Geneva.
Cherpitski was.

64
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:45,349
Cherpitski was banging Elena Rishkov?

65
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:51,113
I just said Zorkin's putting on weight.
Why reduce it to sex? It's disgusting.

66
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,623
I agree. Write it up.
If he is putting on weight,

67
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:59,025
that might have health consequences,
so get it in the afternoon brief.

68
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:04,364
Oh, and somebody find out who is
banging Elena Rishkov. This is good.

69
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:13,071
What shall we make of Chechnya
asking the West for protection?

70
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:18,842
She is like a beautiful virgin, escaping
the clutches of a lecherous bear,

71
00:10:19,051 --> 00:10:22,350
and running to Bill Clinton
to save her maidenhood.

72
00:10:24,724 --> 00:10:29,559
A poet once wrote, "Meet the new
boss, same as the old boss."

73
00:10:30,496 --> 00:10:35,297
He could have been writing of us,
of Europe in the 21 st century.

74
00:10:37,036 --> 00:10:39,561
Over 50 years of America and Russia

75
00:10:39,805 --> 00:10:43,571
imposing their will
on the European community,

76
00:10:43,776 --> 00:10:46,336
East and West,

77
00:10:46,546 --> 00:10:49,845
and we're still treated like children...

78
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:55,116
...but without the toys
or the goodnight chocolates.

79
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:57,516
Each day we lose a little bit more

80
00:10:57,723 --> 00:11:02,660
of our separate sovereign ability
to determine our own futures

81
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:07,265
and each day the world comes just a
little bit closer to that terrible moment

82
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:12,631
when the beating of a butterfly's wings
unleashes a hurricane...

83
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,864
...God himself cannot stop.

84
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:52,901
So what is it?

85
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,877
Are you blind?

86
00:11:56,182 --> 00:11:57,479
It's a bomb.

87
00:11:58,184 --> 00:11:59,481
Where's the fuse?

88
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:10,792
It's warm.

89
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:14,892
So am I. Come on.
I don't have all night.

90
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:45,456
It's a dud.

91
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,764
Let's get it on the truck.

92
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,027
But how can we sell it now?

93
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,797
There's always someone
who'll buy this crap.

94
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,115
I cannot stand all these questions
about my health.

95
00:13:12,224 --> 00:13:17,321
I am to be described as
"robust" and "healthy".

96
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,082
Is that yours or mine?

97
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,048
It must be yours. Mine's just for show.

98
00:13:52,198 --> 00:13:54,223
It's not the hospital.

99
00:13:56,235 --> 00:13:58,328
- Hi.
- You're still here.

100
00:13:59,004 --> 00:14:04,203
Well, I think to be accurate,
it's actually you who's still here.

101
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:08,176
Oh, right.

102
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,513
Not that I'm complaining.

103
00:14:16,756 --> 00:14:18,485
Jack...

104
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,626
I know this is new and all, but...

105
00:14:23,662 --> 00:14:26,290
...I have something I have to say
or I'm going to explode.

106
00:14:26,499 --> 00:14:29,229
I don't want you to be scared.

107
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:33,001
What?

108
00:14:38,244 --> 00:14:40,337
You're in love with me.

109
00:14:47,787 --> 00:14:51,279
Jack, I'm a medical professional.
I can read the symptoms.

110
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:53,856
You're definitely in love with me.

111
00:14:56,428 --> 00:14:58,020
And that scares you?

112
00:14:59,298 --> 00:15:01,198
Not even a little.

113
00:15:02,802 --> 00:15:05,270
But I think it scares you.

114
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,905
No, not even a little.

115
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:14,534
And for the record,
you're the one who brought it up.

116
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:22,219
Forget it.

117
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,446
- I'm gonna get it.
- No way. It'll stop.

118
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:30,495
I don't know who this is.

119
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:35,725
- Just go about your business.
- The timing sucks.

120
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:38,232
Do what you have to do. I understand.

121
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:40,495
Yes, this is Dr Muller.

122
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,738
Muller. You paged me.

123
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:47,308
Hello.

124
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:50,373
Stop! Yes, this is Jack Ryan.

125
00:15:52,751 --> 00:15:54,184
Jesus.

126
00:15:55,187 --> 00:15:57,587
OK. I'll be there in half an hour.

127
00:15:58,591 --> 00:16:02,550
I gotta go. I have an emergency
at work.

128
00:16:02,761 --> 00:16:04,626
I have to go. I'm sorry.

129
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:08,631
Cathy, how about dinner tonight?

130
00:16:08,868 --> 00:16:10,301
Yeah.

131
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:13,869
- How about tomorrow night?
- Jack, I said yes to tonight.

132
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:16,299
I know.

133
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,704
What kind of emergency
does a historian have?

134
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:28,649
He died at 0420 Zulu. 81/2 hours
later, they swore in a new president.

135
00:16:28,854 --> 00:16:31,982
- Who is he?
- Alexander Nemerov.

136
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,820
You're kidding. I wrote a paper
about him a year ago.

137
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:40,192
- I said he could be the next guy.
- I know.

138
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:42,390
- Nobody read it.
- They're reading it now.

139
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:44,603
- Who?
- Cabot.

140
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,431
I've been here 14 months.
He doesn't know what I look...

141
00:16:51,577 --> 00:16:55,138
- Are you Ryan?
- Yes, sir.

142
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,918
What is this? "The Paper Chase"?

143
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:07,623
- Sir, my...
- Come on, we're late.

144
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:17,200
You're about to breathe air that's way
over your pay grade, so listen.

145
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:21,930
You'll be asked for advice. Be sure
you know what you're talking about.

146
00:17:22,174 --> 00:17:24,369
Don't be afraid to say you don't know.

147
00:17:24,576 --> 00:17:27,670
Choose your words carefully.
They could become policy.

148
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,576
Hey, you. Give me your coat.

149
00:17:30,783 --> 00:17:33,115
Come on, you'll get it back.

150
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,321
Tie.

151
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:48,033
So, intelligence committee?

152
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:54,136
I've watched these on C-SPAN.
Never actually been to one.

153
00:17:54,974 --> 00:17:58,068
You've never watched
one of these on C-SPAN.

154
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:23,596
Our most important assessment comes
from a source inside the Kremlin.

155
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:28,068
In his opinion, Nemerov does not owe
his ascension to the military.

156
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:31,265
Everyone has opinions, Mr Cabot.

157
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,341
I respect that.

158
00:18:33,545 --> 00:18:37,811
This morning, my wife woke up
and said I was old, bald and ugly.

159
00:18:39,551 --> 00:18:41,746
Is that a question, Mr Chairman?

160
00:18:43,055 --> 00:18:45,455
I told her
appearances aren't everything.

161
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:48,524
- Would you agree?
- I certainly would.

162
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:52,993
Now, this new fellow, Nezmeroz.
Is that his name?

163
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,927
Nemerov, sir.

164
00:18:56,168 --> 00:19:00,537
Despite what your source says,
we hear that Nezmeroz is a hardliner.

165
00:19:00,739 --> 00:19:02,832
Is he a hardliner?

166
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:04,372
No.

167
00:19:04,576 --> 00:19:07,306
It's too soon to make that assessment.

168
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,140
According to CNN,

169
00:19:09,348 --> 00:19:16,379
your Mr Nezmeroz is making promises
to rebuild the Russian empire.

170
00:19:16,588 --> 00:19:19,352
That sounds pretty rash
from where I sit.

171
00:19:19,558 --> 00:19:22,857
If I were sitting in Chechnya,
I'd be even more worried.

172
00:19:23,962 --> 00:19:27,591
Sir, Nemerov only said that
to get the hardliners off his back.

173
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:30,496
If we leave him alone,
Russia will stabilise.

174
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:36,197
When I asked for your advice, I didn't
mean that you should actually speak.

175
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,706
Mr Cabot?

176
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:43,814
Some of our assets in the Russian
government who know Mr Nemerov

177
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,916
have not had a chance to report in.

178
00:19:46,118 --> 00:19:49,485
I'd like to take a couple of days
and gather more information for you

179
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:52,088
before characterising him,

180
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:56,227
but I do maintain my opinion
that appearances can be deceiving.

181
00:19:57,096 --> 00:19:58,688
You're saying I'm wrong?

182
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,465
Absolutely, Mr Chairman.

183
00:20:04,436 --> 00:20:06,700
I don't think you're ugly.

184
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:13,804
- I was out of line. I apologise.
- Senators don't like to be surprised.

185
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:18,779
I hint at what I'm gonna tell them, then
I give them a while to get used to it.

186
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,214
Then I tell them.

187
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,719
- I understand.
- Good.

188
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:27,391
But I'm right about Nemerov.

189
00:20:29,695 --> 00:20:33,324
Your girlfriend like
this stubborn streak in you?

190
00:20:33,532 --> 00:20:35,466
What?

191
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,761
Cathy Muller,
second year surgical resident,

192
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,336
Baltimore Memorial Hospital.

193
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,540
Welcome to the CIA, sport.

194
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:55,244
Your intelligence is a little flawed.
I wouldn't call her my girlfriend... yet.

195
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:59,788
- What exactly would you call her?
- Great. Amazing.

196
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,823
She's just afraid to commit.

197
00:21:02,027 --> 00:21:03,654
He's terrified of commitment.

198
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,229
A man who's afraid of commitment
after three dates? Alert the media.

199
00:21:07,432 --> 00:21:10,492
- I know, I know.
- So what does he do?

200
00:21:10,736 --> 00:21:14,103
He was in the marines
before he hurt his back.

201
00:21:14,306 --> 00:21:16,740
- Now he's a historian.
- Yawn.

202
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:20,571
No. He works for a think tank
across the river.

203
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:22,337
Double yawn.

204
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:27,542
All right, Rita. Let's see what you have
to say after we meet him tonight.

205
00:21:27,753 --> 00:21:29,448
He's...

206
00:21:31,156 --> 00:21:33,021
...cute?

207
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:37,855
- I have fat fingers.
- Cathy! Cute scale, one to ten.

208
00:21:38,063 --> 00:21:40,998
Oh, God. I don't know.

209
00:21:42,601 --> 00:21:44,000
Twelve.

210
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:52,940
Ask them where they found this.

211
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:03,353
In the field, in the Golan.

212
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:07,685
There was a lot of fighting there
in 1973. Did they witness it?

213
00:22:14,466 --> 00:22:17,196
This one says he lost his son.

214
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:20,735
Does he remember,
was there a plane shot down?

215
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:33,141
Yes, an Israeli jet, destroyed.

216
00:22:42,661 --> 00:22:44,720
This is worthless.

217
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:54,795
But tell him I will give him $400...
because of his son.

218
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:07,648
Thank... thank you.

219
00:23:09,254 --> 00:23:11,188
Thank you.

220
00:23:13,292 --> 00:23:15,760
It's not the sort of thing
you find lying around normally.

221
00:23:15,861 --> 00:23:18,022
- Absolutely not.
- How did you come by it?

222
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:24,100
I found her in the attic of an old
mansion house in Glasgow.

223
00:23:24,336 --> 00:23:30,332
Your little trip to the attic has got you
a piece worth now about L1,000,

224
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:35,103
even in this condition, and had she
been in better condition, even more.

225
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:37,680
A jolly nice find.

226
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:59,459
In fact, what I thought I'd found
was a garden ornament.

227
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,711
Hello, Cathy?

228
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:22,588
Hi. I'm glad you called. I'm running late.
Can you come a half an hour later?

229
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:26,428
I can't make it. I'm really sorry.

230
00:24:29,334 --> 00:24:36,172
- It's a last-minute work thing.
- What's that noise?

231
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:40,706
I'm calling from a plane.

232
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:44,871
- This just came up. I tried to call you.
- Where are you going?

233
00:24:47,552 --> 00:24:49,884
- I can't tell you that.
- Jack.

234
00:24:50,088 --> 00:24:51,919
You can't tell me?

235
00:24:52,124 --> 00:24:53,523
Jack.

236
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:56,489
- Hold on. Yes, sir?
- What are you doing?

237
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,421
I had a date tonight, so I had to cancel.

238
00:25:00,632 --> 00:25:04,830
Don't be stupid. Tell her where you're
going. Tell her who you work for.

239
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,664
She'll be impressed.

240
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:14,201
OK. I work for the CIA.

241
00:25:14,413 --> 00:25:19,180
The director asked me to go with him to
Russia to do a nuclear arms inspection.

242
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:23,915
- Hello?
- That is so lame.

243
00:25:24,122 --> 00:25:28,650
I swear, we get to inspect to make sure
they're decommissioning their arsenal.

244
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,662
Hello?

245
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,458
Hello?

246
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:43,499
Thanks. Thanks a lot.

247
00:26:23,849 --> 00:26:27,444
Zdravstvuyte, William Cabot.

248
00:26:28,687 --> 00:26:30,245
President Nemerov.

249
00:26:43,902 --> 00:26:45,665
Pleasure, sir.

250
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:48,065
May I present Mrs Lathrop.

251
00:26:48,306 --> 00:26:49,830
Mr President.

252
00:26:50,075 --> 00:26:52,873
- General Rand.
- Mr President.

253
00:26:53,078 --> 00:26:55,410
- Dr Ryan.
- Mr President.

254
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:05,012
You must be the Dr Ryan who's done
such interesting research on me.

255
00:27:08,393 --> 00:27:11,521
You should not be surprised.
We know quite a bit.

256
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:19,893
We know how wrong your report was
that I had many girlfriends in college.

257
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:32,874
I met my wife in my third year and have
not looked at another woman since.

258
00:27:33,084 --> 00:27:37,316
I was referring to
the first two years... sir.

259
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:47,123
Where you received
highest honors in English.

260
00:27:50,969 --> 00:27:52,493
I like you.

261
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:57,035
Well, in that case, so do I.

262
00:28:00,078 --> 00:28:03,809
I apologise for interjecting myself
in your inspection tour,

263
00:28:04,015 --> 00:28:07,109
but I have a message
for President Fowler.

264
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:09,913
You could just call him on the phone.

265
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:14,251
I would like him to hear it from you,
his friend of many years,

266
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:16,450
who received it personally from me,

267
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:21,428
and saw my expression and the
language of my body as I spoke it.

268
00:28:21,633 --> 00:28:23,260
I understand.

269
00:28:24,736 --> 00:28:26,931
Chechnya is an internal affair.

270
00:28:27,172 --> 00:28:30,630
What we do there should be
none of your concern.

271
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,643
I will relay the message,
but I don't think he will agree.

272
00:28:34,846 --> 00:28:38,304
Some people in my country
will use this issue to weaken me.

273
00:28:39,551 --> 00:28:41,212
Some people in my country say

274
00:28:41,419 --> 00:28:45,355
your war in Chechnya
is exactly your weakness.

275
00:28:46,257 --> 00:28:47,918
Chechnya is a nation of criminals.

276
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:52,119
Every day brings another cowardly
attack on innocent Russian citizens.

277
00:28:52,330 --> 00:28:54,389
It is none of your concern.

278
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:59,095
Stability is our concern.

279
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:02,329
Peace in Chechnya is our concern.

280
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:06,168
And, if I may speak frankly...

281
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:10,340
...your control over your military
concerns us too.

282
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:24,425
For you to get involved here, it's... like
sleeping with another man's wife.

283
00:29:26,064 --> 00:29:29,124
And what you are suggesting
is that afterward

284
00:29:29,367 --> 00:29:32,564
they can all live together
under the same roof.

285
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:39,809
But what really happens is
the betrayed husband buys a gun.

286
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:52,585
- That went well.
- Who's the guy with Nemerov?

287
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:55,351
- Anatoli Grushkov.
- Old KGB?

288
00:29:55,560 --> 00:30:00,691
He's been around since Brezhnev.
Nobody's had the guts to get rid of him.

289
00:30:00,899 --> 00:30:02,890
Because he knows
where the bodies are buried?

290
00:30:03,101 --> 00:30:05,001
He probably buried them himself.

291
00:30:20,051 --> 00:30:24,511
And we were able to obtain a roster
of their scientists at Arzamas.

292
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:27,487
Who's who, what their expertise is.

293
00:31:00,759 --> 00:31:02,386
Arzamas-16 is home

294
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:06,927
to the All-Russian Scientific Research
Institute of Experimental Physics

295
00:31:07,132 --> 00:31:11,228
and is the birthplace
of our first atomic bomb.

296
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,671
Many of our greatest scientists
worked here and many still do.

297
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,672
Since 1995,

298
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,540
we have dismantled
over 10,000 nuclear devices.

299
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:31,320
We tried so hard to get in here
over the years.

300
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:33,991
I sent three people.

301
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:37,817
They all died trying.

302
00:32:04,355 --> 00:32:06,880
What does the T-shirt say?

303
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:12,688
"I am a bomb technician. If you
see me running... try to catch up."

304
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:17,898
OK.

305
00:32:19,070 --> 00:32:23,530
Sir, I'm sorry. Just one quick thing.
I'm sure it's nothing.

306
00:32:23,775 --> 00:32:28,337
According to this, there are
17 senior scientists on duty today.

307
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,215
I only count 14.

308
00:32:33,585 --> 00:32:39,956
Doctors Milinov, Orlov and Spassky.
They don't seem to be here.

309
00:32:41,459 --> 00:32:43,427
I will make inquiries.

310
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:46,756
Dr Milinov is out sick.
Orlov is on vacation.

311
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:50,526
Spassky, I'm grieved to say,
was killed

312
00:32:50,768 --> 00:32:53,760
driving his car to work
just this past week.

313
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,175
We move on, shall we?

314
00:33:01,846 --> 00:33:03,143
Please.

315
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:10,549
Very impressive. You almost seem
to have that information memorised.

316
00:33:10,755 --> 00:33:13,553
I assumed you would ask, Dr Ryan.

317
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,153
We touch down at Andrews at 2130.
Tell him to meet me there.

318
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,992
Sir? Those three missing scientists.

319
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,395
Milinov's expertise is detonators.

320
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:01,537
Spassky's expertise
is the nuclear core.

321
00:34:01,739 --> 00:34:03,400
Orlov is a mathematician

322
00:34:03,608 --> 00:34:08,409
whose expertise is the geometry of
high explosives inside a fission bomb.

323
00:34:08,613 --> 00:34:12,344
The exact three men you would need
if you wanted to build a bomb.

324
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,451
- Grushkov said...
- Grushkov's a liar.

325
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:19,145
Milinov is not sick.
Orlov hardly ever takes a vacation

326
00:34:19,357 --> 00:34:23,919
and Spassky, who's supposed to have
died driving a car, doesn't drive.

327
00:34:25,496 --> 00:34:28,431
They have no idea
where these guys are.

328
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,234
I'm dying to ask you how you know.

329
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:41,103
Secure source inside the Kremlin.

330
00:34:41,312 --> 00:34:43,177
Codename Spinnaker.

331
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:46,373
He gives me stuff, I give him stuff.

332
00:34:46,584 --> 00:34:50,987
We keep the back channels open
in hopes of staving off disaster.

333
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:55,250
And speaking of disaster,
did you call your girlfriend yet?

334
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:58,861
No. I don't know how to get out of this.

335
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:04,829
All right. Invite her to the White House
correspondents dinner Sunday night.

336
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:07,537
It's the hottest ticket in town.

337
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:12,867
- Sounds great. How do I get in?
- Trust me.

338
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,390
I'll see you at the car.

339
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,499
Still loving your desk job?

340
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:46,533
Yeah, I am.

341
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:49,110
How's your Russian?

342
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:50,974
Still works. Why?

343
00:35:52,417 --> 00:35:56,877
Three Russian nuclear scientists are
missing. I need to know where they are.

344
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:03,656
I wasn't doing this any more.

345
00:36:03,861 --> 00:36:06,591
I just need information this time,
Johnny.

346
00:36:06,798 --> 00:36:11,462
Your orders are on the plane.
Wheels up at 2330. Have a nice flight.

347
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:25,813
Sunday night, 8.00, at the Hilton. The
tickets are in the name of John Clark.

348
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:29,545
- You do have a tux?
- Yeah, yes, sir.

349
00:36:35,993 --> 00:36:41,488
My beautiful wife, Julie, is from
New Jersey. 15 electoral votes.

350
00:36:43,501 --> 00:36:45,969
And is, as you know, half-Jewish,

351
00:36:46,204 --> 00:36:50,470
so we'll take Florida's
25 electoral votes and divide by two.

352
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:55,636
- This is a nice hotel.
- Yeah. Beautiful.

353
00:36:55,847 --> 00:37:00,580
My friend Rita stayed here once.
She said it was... nice.

354
00:37:02,587 --> 00:37:06,114
Maybe after dinner we can...

355
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:08,690
...we can get a room here.

356
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,123
I already did.

357
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,990
- You didn't.
- Yes, I did.

358
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,496
...I did, on a handful of occasions,
smoke marijuana.

359
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:25,338
California, 54 electoral votes.

360
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:07,147
At 0600 Moscow time, the Russians
launched a massive artillery strike

361
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:10,548
against Grozny,
the capital of Chechnya.

362
00:38:10,755 --> 00:38:15,522
The shells contained an experimental
chemical weapon, a nerve agent.

363
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:19,423
Saturation, you can see
on the sat photos, took 20 minutes,

364
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:23,157
after which every person
inside a radius of 12 miles

365
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:28,270
was rendered helpless by symptoms
approximating late-stage cerebral palsy.

366
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,963
- Oh, my God.
- How many dead?

367
00:38:32,443 --> 00:38:34,741
Best guess, 80%.

368
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:40,713
Nemerov launched the biggest attack
in the history of chemical warfare.

369
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:44,649
- Let's talk response.
- The worst thing we can do is nothing.

370
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:49,554
If he gets away with chemical weapons,
what's next? Biological, nuclear?

371
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:54,459
OK. Short of gassing the Kremlin,
what's the strongest response?

372
00:38:54,665 --> 00:38:57,361
- We send in peacekeepers.
- Chechnya's not sovereign.

373
00:38:57,602 --> 00:39:02,539
They requested recognition, so we
give it. Not full diplomatic, provisional.

374
00:39:02,773 --> 00:39:07,540
Then the Chechens request assistance
and we send in peacekeepers.

375
00:39:07,745 --> 00:39:11,203
- How do you get them in there?
- We fly them in from Turkey.

376
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:16,182
- Over Armenian air space?
- To screw Russia? They won't complain.

377
00:39:17,822 --> 00:39:21,155
Let's do it. Nemerov can choke on it.

378
00:39:22,093 --> 00:39:23,424
Bill?

379
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,262
- Dr Ryan.
- Yes, sir.

380
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,489
What do you think?

381
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:37,038
Conventional wisdom suggests

382
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:40,142
that Nemerov is playing
the traditional Russian role:

383
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:44,303
Be aggressive, flex your muscles,
dare the world to stop you.

384
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:48,007
- But Nemerov isn't conventional.
- He acts like a hardliner.

385
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,619
With respect, I don't think he is one.

386
00:39:50,821 --> 00:39:55,281
He just gassed the capital of another
country. With respect, you're wrong.

387
00:39:55,493 --> 00:40:00,658
- So what are we wasting our time for?
- What if he didn't order the attack?

388
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:05,899
What if Nemerov
didn't order the attack?

389
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:11,431
What if it was a... a rogue general?

390
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:15,772
Or a military unit frustrated they
couldn't get the rebels out of the city?

391
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:21,111
Have you reason to believe he didn't
order it, or are you just floating this?

392
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,277
You don't know.

393
00:40:28,592 --> 00:40:33,154
I don't think he did it, sir.
I would bet he didn't do it.

394
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:40,066
Will senior staff remain behind
for a few minutes, please?

395
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,255
Russia's newly-installed president,
Alexander Nemerov,

396
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:11,925
has just begun to address the state.
We join him in progress.

397
00:41:16,107 --> 00:41:19,702
For ten years now,
we have contended...

398
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:22,936
Excuse me. Could you turn that up?

399
00:41:24,048 --> 00:41:26,312
...toward innocent Russian citizens.

400
00:41:28,352 --> 00:41:29,751
Finally...

401
00:41:30,888 --> 00:41:34,449
...every nation has a right
to defend itself.

402
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,056
This terrorism must end.

403
00:41:40,097 --> 00:41:44,397
The bombing of Chechnya...
was my decision.

404
00:41:48,305 --> 00:41:50,296
Nice going, ace.

405
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,785
Who did it?

406
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:07,389
General Pildysh, General Mitkin.
Unhappy old Communists.

407
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,422
Bastards.

408
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:12,687
- Relieve them of command.
- I will shoot them myself.

409
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,127
Just disappear them.

410
00:42:15,332 --> 00:42:19,632
Their execution would tell the world
I didn't have control.

411
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:25,069
These days, better to appear guilty
than impotent.

412
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,045
How is our Russian friend
affected by this?

413
00:42:33,818 --> 00:42:39,688
I am not affected.
I remain devoted to our little plan.

414
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:44,092
At what you're charging us,
I am not surprised.

415
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:47,753
- And the American?
- Mr Mason is a believer.

416
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:51,696
I put a little extra
in the escrow account for him.

417
00:42:51,936 --> 00:42:56,373
- Why?
- He won't live long enough to get it.

418
00:42:56,574 --> 00:43:00,567
- Where is the package?
- It left Haifa a week ago.

419
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:04,373
I'm told these things can kill you.

420
00:43:08,018 --> 00:43:11,317
But so much has changed.

421
00:43:12,723 --> 00:43:19,151
Perhaps the new situation suggests
we consider... a different approach?

422
00:43:22,633 --> 00:43:26,399
Maybe try to bring Russia
more into Europe,

423
00:43:26,637 --> 00:43:29,606
more into our way of thinking?

424
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:33,140
We have discussed that,
Monsieur Monceau,

425
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:36,472
and with your concurrence, rejected it.

426
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,843
Oh. Perhaps we were hasty.

427
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,178
- Perhaps our plan is...
- Is what?

428
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:50,521
Not perfectly conceived.

429
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:58,368
Are you crazy? All over
the world, right-wing parties,

430
00:43:58,569 --> 00:44:03,370
nationalist movements,
Nazis, Aryan Nations,

431
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:06,702
all working together for the first time.

432
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:08,708
Is that not perfect?

433
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:21,313
Well, I respect the will and judgment
of my friends.

434
00:44:22,126 --> 00:44:26,153
But in light of the week's events,
I am grown...

435
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:30,299
...uncomfortable with this plan.

436
00:44:30,534 --> 00:44:34,026
So I must... beg your leave.

437
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:41,771
Gentlemen.

438
00:44:46,951 --> 00:44:49,476
Herr Haft will help you out.

439
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,650
Your scarf, monsieur.

440
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:16,109
Watch it with that thing.
You're gonna kill somebody.

441
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:46,843
Yo, what's up, Mason?

442
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:54,280
You know, I always wanted to ask
you... Where'd you get that tat, man?

443
00:45:57,354 --> 00:45:58,651
The navy.

444
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,222
The navy? I was in the navy.

445
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:05,662
Hospital ship, six years. You?

446
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:10,330
Eight months.

447
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:13,335
Oh. You wash out?

448
00:46:21,211 --> 00:46:23,475
All right, brother.
You have a good one.

449
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,617
Yeah, brother.

450
00:46:35,859 --> 00:46:41,092
...not realising the rest of the world is
watching and will take a cue from us...

451
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,790
The unprecedented attack
on Chechnya

452
00:46:45,035 --> 00:46:48,937
signals a dangerous
and troubling shift in Russian policy.

453
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:53,906
It demands the toughest and most
unambiguous response from the West.

454
00:46:54,778 --> 00:46:59,875
NATO forces are on their way to
Chechnya to serve as peacekeepers

455
00:47:00,017 --> 00:47:05,853
and to provide humanitarian aid
to victims of this monstrous...

456
00:47:08,926 --> 00:47:11,053
I expected this.

457
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,956
Really?

458
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:20,068
What will you do?

459
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,500
Nothing.

460
00:47:22,706 --> 00:47:26,437
We will do nothing.

461
00:47:28,312 --> 00:47:32,772
These are four hours old. Russian
12th, 15th and 2nd tank regiments.

462
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:35,213
Why haven't they moved?

463
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:38,445
- Nemerov's too smart to move them.
- He speaks.

464
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:43,922
Jack, Nemerov's got, like, 19,000
tanks. No way NATO can match that.

465
00:47:44,128 --> 00:47:46,460
That's why he's not gonna move them.

466
00:47:46,663 --> 00:47:50,656
It's like chess.
He's thinking three moves ahead.

467
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:55,167
The NATO playbook says we can only
stop him with tactical nuclear weapons.

468
00:47:55,372 --> 00:47:58,899
And he won't risk a nuclear war
over this.

469
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:05,479
I also think he's sending us
a message. He didn't bomb Grozny.

470
00:48:16,460 --> 00:48:19,429
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Mrs Spassky.

471
00:48:19,630 --> 00:48:22,155
At the end of the corridor.

472
00:48:28,372 --> 00:48:31,432
I haven't seen Sasha since university.

473
00:48:31,675 --> 00:48:36,840
And you were his teaching assistant?
Strange, I don't remember you.

474
00:48:37,047 --> 00:48:41,643
When he heard I was in Arzamas,
he asked me to look in on you.

475
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:49,222
- He says he'll take me to the West.
- That would require a lot of money.

476
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:53,658
Just because the imbeciles here pay
him nothing doesn't mean others won't.

477
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:56,833
He has a secret job.

478
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,630
For the government?

479
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:01,895
For imbeciles with money.

480
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:07,969
Same nonsense, do this, don't do that.

481
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:10,408
They even told him
not to call his mother.

482
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:12,676
The pigs.

483
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:17,445
I could die any day
and he can't phone his mother.

484
00:49:17,654 --> 00:49:21,886
But my Sasha, he called.

485
00:49:22,092 --> 00:49:24,219
Just last night.

486
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:34,570
Clark got us her number. NSA traced
calls to that number back to here.

487
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:39,902
It's an abandoned Soviet army base
on the Kremenchug reservoir.

488
00:49:42,512 --> 00:49:46,209
What are three Russian atomic
scientists doing in Ukraine?

489
00:49:47,517 --> 00:49:49,815
A fair guess, they're building a bomb.

490
00:49:50,020 --> 00:49:54,650
Nemerov has thousands of bombs.
Why would he build a secret one?

491
00:49:54,858 --> 00:49:56,758
Deniability.

492
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:02,999
Build one nobody knows about, he can
drive it to Chechnya in his Beemer.

493
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,896
No way to track it, no way to trace it.

494
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:10,337
He could set it off and say,
"I didn't do it."

495
00:50:11,675 --> 00:50:14,235
With respect, I don't think
that adds up.

496
00:50:14,444 --> 00:50:18,847
It adds up. You just don't like
what it adds up to.

497
00:50:50,681 --> 00:50:54,447
Ah, the warmth of plutonium decay.

498
00:50:54,651 --> 00:50:59,418
It's completely corroded.
At least you're wearing gloves.

499
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:10,064
Anyone want to light up
an American cigarette?

500
00:51:11,101 --> 00:51:13,069
You're crazy.

501
00:51:16,139 --> 00:51:17,936
I'm going out.

502
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,709
The explosive blocks
must be replaced.

503
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,509
Machined to a thousandth
of a millimetre

504
00:51:27,718 --> 00:51:30,551
in a mathematically determined
configuration.

505
00:51:31,288 --> 00:51:36,123
- Do we have a bomb?
- First we must analyse the yield...

506
00:51:36,326 --> 00:51:39,454
Do we have a bomb?

507
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,790
Yes.

508
00:51:46,503 --> 00:51:48,471
Yes, we do.

509
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:08,148
This is a... a test.

510
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:13,725
Answer it.

511
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:16,791
- Answer it.
- Are you sure?

512
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:23,063
Hello?

513
00:52:23,673 --> 00:52:25,106
Yes.

514
00:52:31,415 --> 00:52:32,746
Yes, sir.

515
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,382
I have to go outside for just a second.

516
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:44,391
OK? I'll be right back.

517
00:52:44,594 --> 00:52:47,085
I'll be right back.

518
00:53:02,379 --> 00:53:06,315
- Sir, I write reports.
- I reviewed your military records.

519
00:53:06,516 --> 00:53:10,782
- You can take care of yourself.
- Yes, sir. But I'm not trained for that.

520
00:53:10,987 --> 00:53:17,256
I'm not asking you to be an operations
officer, just my eyes and ears. I can't go.

521
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:22,322
So... this isn't sanctioned.

522
00:53:26,336 --> 00:53:30,602
I want you to give this to Clark,
see what he finds out, bring it home.

523
00:53:33,009 --> 00:53:34,306
Yes, sir.

524
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,139
Jack...

525
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:43,214
...we never had this discussion.

526
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,411
What discussion?

527
00:53:59,503 --> 00:54:03,132
OK. Clark... So this is
three days ago.

528
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:07,207
It shows vehicles here.
Guards here and here.

529
00:54:07,410 --> 00:54:09,207
I gotta get one of those.

530
00:54:10,213 --> 00:54:14,980
Now, the infrared satellite
took this photograph 34 hours ago.

531
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,452
That shows guards here and here.

532
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:21,153
I don't even have e-mail.

533
00:54:22,826 --> 00:54:26,762
There are two at the checkpoint,
between two and five in the barracks

534
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:30,262
and two with the package,
which we believe to be here.

535
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:33,959
No problem. Give me a couple
of guys, some tranquilliser darts,

536
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:36,104
we can be out in six minutes.

537
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:38,900
- There is a problem.
- What's that?

538
00:54:39,109 --> 00:54:42,545
This is yesterday.
No guards visible at all.

539
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,315
Why is that a problem, Mr Ryan?

540
00:54:46,516 --> 00:54:51,249
For two reasons. Either we can't
see them, which is bad,

541
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,684
or worse, they left, and we're too late.

542
00:54:55,492 --> 00:54:56,789
Suit up.

543
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:59,621
- What?
- You can't go dressed like that.

544
00:55:00,597 --> 00:55:05,762
No, no. I'm an analyst.
I don't go on missions.

545
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:09,460
Relax, 007. It's not a mission.
It's just a recce.

546
00:55:09,706 --> 00:55:13,437
OK, fine, whatever you call it.
I don't do that. I just write reports.

547
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:17,204
OK. So write a report about it. Suit up.

548
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:18,711
Clark, no.

549
00:55:19,449 --> 00:55:21,940
Clark... no.

550
00:55:23,954 --> 00:55:28,118
So, Cabot tells me you got my ticket
to the correspondents dinner.

551
00:55:28,692 --> 00:55:33,186
Have a good time?
I've never been to one of those.

552
00:55:33,396 --> 00:55:36,331
I was actually looking forward to it.

553
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:58,087
Clark, no. I'm not going in there.

554
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:02,520
Goddamn right. You're gonna stay here
and make sure no one steals my boat.

555
00:56:02,726 --> 00:56:04,523
Be right back.

556
00:58:02,212 --> 00:58:03,440
Damn.

557
00:59:37,106 --> 00:59:38,971
Oh, Jesus.

558
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:42,578
Oh, God. Immigration didn't
call you guys, huh?

559
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:51,482
I'm sorry. You speak English?
I don't speak much Ukrainian.

560
00:59:53,823 --> 00:59:57,281
It's not what you think. I'm an
American citizen. I have my papers...

561
00:59:58,228 --> 01:00:00,788
OK. No papers.

562
01:00:00,997 --> 01:00:03,522
Please. Just put the gun down.

563
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:08,031
The light? You want
me to put the light down?

564
01:00:10,006 --> 01:00:13,066
OK. Take it easy.
I'll put the light down.

565
01:00:13,243 --> 01:00:15,768
Here we go, I'm putting it down.

566
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,951
Shoot him, Ryan.

567
01:00:29,826 --> 01:00:31,293
Shoot him.

568
01:00:36,933 --> 01:00:39,959
Shoot him before he figures out
what I'm saying.

569
01:00:46,876 --> 01:00:49,868
- Get their shoes.
- What?

570
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,570
Tell them to take their shoes off.

571
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:06,485
- You speak Ukrainian.
- Yeah. You don't?

572
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:18,640
Whatever it is they were spray painting
was big, about the size of a fridge.

573
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,935
The imprint it left was deep.
So we know three things.

574
01:01:22,145 --> 01:01:26,809
It was heavy, something was
radioactive, and now it's gone.

575
01:01:28,851 --> 01:01:31,911
- One of them spoke English?
- South African.

576
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:35,147
So, what's a South African
doing in the Ukraine

577
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:38,691
with three Russian scientists
and a crate from Israel?

578
01:01:44,834 --> 01:01:48,065
- Tell Cabot I'll call him from Haifa.
- I have a feeling you better hurry.

579
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:56,976
Most people believe the 20th century
was defined by the death struggle

580
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,808
of communism versus capitalism

581
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:03,282
and that fascism was but a hiccup.

582
01:02:04,621 --> 01:02:06,589
Today we know better.

583
01:02:08,224 --> 01:02:13,594
Communism was a fool's errand. The
followers of Marx, gone from this earth.

584
01:02:13,796 --> 01:02:17,288
But the followers of Hitler
abound and thrive.

585
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:21,693
Hitler, however,
had one great disadvantage.

586
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:25,430
He lived in a time when fascism,
like a virus,

587
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:28,075
like the AIDS virus,

588
01:02:28,277 --> 01:02:33,977
needed a strong host in order to spread.
Germany was that host.

589
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:37,619
But strong as it was,
Germany could not prevail.

590
01:02:37,820 --> 01:02:40,414
The world was too big.

591
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:44,423
Fortunately, the world has changed.

592
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:49,064
Global communications,
cable TV, the internet.

593
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,995
Today the world is smaller

594
01:02:52,235 --> 01:02:56,365
and the virus does not need
a strong host in order to spread.

595
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:59,265
This virus...

596
01:02:59,976 --> 01:03:02,103
...is airborne.

597
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:08,482
One more thing.
Let no man call us crazy.

598
01:03:08,685 --> 01:03:13,748
They called Hitler crazy, but Hitler
wasn't crazy. He was stupid.

599
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:16,516
You don't fight Russia and America.

600
01:03:16,726 --> 01:03:20,492
You get Russia and America
to fight each other

601
01:03:20,697 --> 01:03:23,757
and destroy each other.

602
01:03:59,969 --> 01:04:03,905
- What did you find?
- Ukraine's exports are online.

603
01:04:04,107 --> 01:04:06,041
I pulled up the shipping manifests.

604
01:04:06,242 --> 01:04:11,043
The only crate that size was picked up
at Kiev International ten days ago

605
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:13,044
and flown to the Canary Islands.

606
01:04:13,249 --> 01:04:16,343
The air force has a nuclear
assessment team. Call them...

607
01:04:16,552 --> 01:04:20,784
Jack, it got put on a cargo freighter,
headed for the East Coast.

608
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:25,887
- What?
- Baltimore. It's coming here.

609
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:39,005
It's a great view from the Budweiser
blimp as we count down to game time.

610
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:41,768
We'll have the pre-game festivities

611
01:04:41,978 --> 01:04:46,278
as well as the arrival of the nation's
number one football fan in a moment.

612
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:51,682
Then conquer we must

613
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:56,222
For our cause it is just

614
01:04:56,659 --> 01:05:01,619
And this be our motto

615
01:05:01,831 --> 01:05:05,995
In God is our trust

616
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:10,865
And the star-spangled banner

617
01:05:11,107 --> 01:05:19,981
Forever shall wave

618
01:05:20,683 --> 01:05:25,950
O'er the land of the free...

619
01:05:26,823 --> 01:05:29,053
Get me the duty officer!

620
01:05:29,258 --> 01:05:37,131
Home of the brave

621
01:05:46,209 --> 01:05:49,872
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States,

622
01:05:50,079 --> 01:05:52,343
Robert Fowler!

623
01:05:56,686 --> 01:05:58,313
Showtime.

624
01:06:28,918 --> 01:06:30,215
Shit.

625
01:06:37,260 --> 01:06:40,024
15 yard penalty, first down.

626
01:06:40,229 --> 01:06:41,662
That's the way!

627
01:06:49,572 --> 01:06:50,539
Shit.

628
01:07:11,093 --> 01:07:12,060
Hello.

629
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,288
- Hello?
- Sir!

630
01:07:15,498 --> 01:07:18,262
- Hello?
- Sir!

631
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:23,635
Shit!

632
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,249
- Cabot.
- It's Ryan.

633
01:07:44,794 --> 01:07:47,661
- What?
- The bomb is in play.

634
01:07:47,863 --> 01:07:53,665
The AFRAT team are meeting me at
the docks in 20 minutes to try to find it.

635
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,394
- What docks?
- Baltimore.

636
01:07:56,639 --> 01:08:00,370
- You're breaking up. What did you say?
- Baltimore.

637
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:04,637
- I'm losing you. I'll call you back...
- Baltimore.

638
01:08:07,049 --> 01:08:08,516
Sir!

639
01:08:34,377 --> 01:08:37,107
John! Red-Green! Let's go! Let's go!

640
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:39,915
Move it! Let's go!

641
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:51,658
Move! Go, go, go, go! Move!

642
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:02,404
What the hell is going on?

643
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:07,008
Some Russian scientists made a
nuclear bomb. It's arrived in Baltimore.

644
01:09:07,209 --> 01:09:10,770
- Get those people out of the stadium.
- Stay down!

645
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:35,764
The President has been taken
off the field.

646
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:38,667
- 407.
- Thanks, JJ.

647
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:29,413
Clearly something has happened
of tremendous proportions.

648
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:34,995
We have no word as to what but
there is an enormous cloud over...

649
01:11:09,331 --> 01:11:11,060
Go, go, go!

650
01:11:18,073 --> 01:11:20,871
Mr President! Are you all right?

651
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:23,271
He's stuck. Get out of the way.

652
01:11:27,983 --> 01:11:30,076
Mr President, are you all right?

653
01:11:34,423 --> 01:11:37,881
Are you all right, Mr President?
This is the marines, sir.

654
01:11:38,093 --> 01:11:39,754
I need your help, Danny.

655
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:43,159
Alvarez, get me a stretcher, now!

656
01:11:45,634 --> 01:11:47,693
You got the stretcher?

657
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:58,278
- You got the stretcher?
- No, I don't want one.

658
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,347
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

659
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,141
Move it!

660
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:14,622
Move it!

661
01:12:21,237 --> 01:12:24,035
Go, go! Close them off! Go on up!

662
01:12:48,831 --> 01:12:50,696
Mr President...

663
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:54,460
There's been a nuclear explosion in
America. You must come with us now.

664
01:12:55,070 --> 01:12:56,560
What?

665
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:02,038
We don't know who or how.
But it wasn't us.

666
01:13:02,244 --> 01:13:06,476
After Grozny you hope it wasn't us.

667
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:09,173
We are drafting
a strong denial for you.

668
01:13:09,385 --> 01:13:12,047
And a statement of sympathy.

669
01:13:12,254 --> 01:13:15,746
And Yuri... order all military
on the alert.

670
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:04,423
Hey! It's Ryan.

671
01:15:04,933 --> 01:15:08,369
- Jack, where are you?
- Somewhere outside Baltimore.

672
01:15:08,570 --> 01:15:11,505
- Cabot got the President out.
- Where is he now?

673
01:15:11,707 --> 01:15:16,644
They're taking him airborne, on NAOC.
They think it might be the Russians.

674
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:22,984
It wasn't the Russians. I gotta talk to
Cabot. Patch me through to the plane.

675
01:15:23,185 --> 01:15:27,747
Cabot's not on the plane. We don't
know where he is. Call back in an hour.

676
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:32,188
We don't have an hour. Fowler's
gonna want to hit back now.

677
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:38,826
Listen. We have to prove it wasn't the
Russians before he's convinced it is.

678
01:15:39,067 --> 01:15:41,001
Can you get back to Langley?

679
01:15:41,203 --> 01:15:46,505
There's no time. The radiation
assessment team, where are they?

680
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:47,609
Stambler Tunnels, south of the city.

681
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,304
Stambler Tunnels, south of the city.

682
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:53,804
The prevailing winds are blowing
the fallout to the east and north.

683
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,075
As long as you stay south you're OK.

684
01:15:58,454 --> 01:16:02,322
- Mr President, are you all right?
- How the hell do you think I am?

685
01:16:02,524 --> 01:16:04,754
- How many casualties?
- We don't know.

686
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:10,125
- How the hell did it get there?
- We don't know. Radar didn't pick it up.

687
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:13,961
- Well, how is Cabot? Where is he?
- I don't know.

688
01:16:14,203 --> 01:16:17,036
- What do you know?
- I don't know, all right? I don't know!

689
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:18,866
I don't know!

690
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:36,024
- General, Kondor is not on board.
- Send the AFRAT team.

691
01:16:37,392 --> 01:16:40,361
Mr President, I recommend
we move to DEFCON-2.

692
01:16:40,562 --> 01:16:42,120
Where's our intelligence?

693
01:16:42,331 --> 01:16:44,595
Russian air defences
are at their highest level.

694
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:48,531
Maybe they're afraid of being attacked.
I can't get this goddamn chair open!

695
01:16:48,770 --> 01:16:50,101
We're about to take off.

696
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:52,899
- We don't know who did it...
- We think the Russians...

697
01:16:53,141 --> 01:16:55,473
- You think?
- Sir, DEFCON-2.

698
01:16:55,677 --> 01:16:59,579
- We're groping in the dark...
- This is too much goddamn bullshit!

699
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:04,215
And not enough fact.

700
01:17:18,867 --> 01:17:22,303
The blast crater is about
100, 150 yards wide,

701
01:17:22,538 --> 01:17:24,938
which suggests a low-yield device,

702
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:28,109
quite a bit smaller
than the Hiroshima bomb.

703
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:32,337
A quarter of a square mile
around the stadium is just gone.

704
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:36,917
Beyond that, buildings remain, heavily
damaged, for another quarter mile.

705
01:17:37,119 --> 01:17:40,919
The damage tapers off the farther
you get from Ground Zero.

706
01:17:50,265 --> 01:17:51,596
Dubinin.

707
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:56,737
Herr Haft has left for America.
Now we are counting on you.

708
01:17:58,407 --> 01:18:02,571
I assure you,
I will earn every pfennig.

709
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:06,746
Attention.

710
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:09,076
You've heard of the bomb in the USA.

711
01:18:09,284 --> 01:18:11,548
What you haven't heard
is that 15 minutes ago

712
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:16,019
an American ICBM hit Moscow.

713
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:23,255
We are to retaliate against an American
aircraft carrier in the North Sea.

714
01:18:23,432 --> 01:18:25,957
Man your aircraft.

715
01:18:48,924 --> 01:18:52,826
The ash isn't radioactive. The winds
are blowing the fallout to sea.

716
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:54,825
Captain. Jack Ryan, CIA.

717
01:18:55,030 --> 01:18:57,931
Lorna Shiro. You need to wait outside.

718
01:18:58,133 --> 01:19:00,795
I need to know all you know
about the bomb.

719
01:19:01,036 --> 01:19:06,941
We're collecting samples. Get in line
and we'll have the report out tomorrow.

720
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:10,942
Captain, I need to know now
where this bomb came from,

721
01:19:11,146 --> 01:19:15,708
or even where it didn't come from
or there may not be a tomorrow.

722
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:19,112
Shit. Wesson, where are you?

723
01:19:19,321 --> 01:19:21,312
About a quarter mile from Ground Zero.

724
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:26,586
This is about as far as we'll go.
My feet are sizzling.

725
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,855
I'm getting rads
nearly the limit of our gear.

726
01:19:30,065 --> 01:19:33,592
- OK. Cut the rover loose and get out.
- Roger that.

727
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:48,375
Dillon, the crate the bomb was shipped
in. Somebody had to sign for it at port.

728
01:19:48,583 --> 01:19:52,280
Customs must have a database.
Get me a name. Where's Cabot?

729
01:19:52,487 --> 01:19:55,115
No one knows.
We're checking the hospitals.

730
01:19:55,323 --> 01:19:57,814
- Have you tried Memorial?
- He wouldn't be there.

731
01:19:58,026 --> 01:20:01,189
No, I mean... Is it still...

732
01:20:03,398 --> 01:20:05,730
It's Cathy's hospital.

733
01:20:06,501 --> 01:20:09,595
As far as I know it's still there,
but the phones are down.

734
01:20:09,838 --> 01:20:12,329
All right. Can you keep checking?
Thanks.

735
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:19,607
They could have launched
a cruise missile.

736
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:22,784
- We don't know that this is Russia.
- We don't know it's not.

737
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:28,513
If they were sending us a message,
they'd want us to know it was them.

738
01:20:28,724 --> 01:20:32,592
Except they could inspire
the confusion we're going through now.

739
01:20:32,794 --> 01:20:34,887
Mr President, we're uplinked.

740
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:44,398
President Nemerov, there's been a
major nuclear event in the United States.

741
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:46,106
Loss of life is severe.

742
01:20:46,341 --> 01:20:48,935
- It was no accident.
- It was not an accident.

743
01:20:49,144 --> 01:20:52,545
We don't yet know where
it came from, we don't...

744
01:20:52,748 --> 01:20:58,414
We have not yet ascertained the
source of this weapon. Rest assured...

745
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:03,353
We have not yet ascertained
the source of this weapon.

746
01:21:03,959 --> 01:21:08,658
But rest assured those responsible
will be dealt with most severely.

747
01:21:10,665 --> 01:21:13,156
He's fishing.

748
01:21:13,368 --> 01:21:15,336
Send our reply.

749
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:19,364
Whoa, that was a little fast.

750
01:21:19,574 --> 01:21:22,702
"Please accept the deepest
sympathies of the Russian people."

751
01:21:22,911 --> 01:21:26,210
"If it was deliberate,
this is a crime without precedent."

752
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:29,440
"What madman would do such a thing
and for what purpose?"

753
01:21:29,684 --> 01:21:32,983
"You must believe that Russia had
nothing to do with this infamous act."

754
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:36,646
It's canned.
He prepared that in advance.

755
01:21:37,726 --> 01:21:42,163
President Nemerov, we've no reason
to suspect Russian involvement...

756
01:21:42,364 --> 01:21:43,831
...at this time...

757
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:49,761
...but we will protect ourselves
from further aggression.

758
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,404
He thinks we did this.

759
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:56,840
We must demonstrate
the strength of our weapons.

760
01:21:57,045 --> 01:22:02,642
They have to understand that
attacking Russia would be suicide.

761
01:22:02,884 --> 01:22:06,445
Increase the alert status.

762
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:46,887
TAO, EW. I'm picking up
intermittent radar, bearing 020.

763
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,029
Where?

764
01:22:52,801 --> 01:22:54,200
Now it's gone.

765
01:23:02,377 --> 01:23:04,368
There. It's a weak signal.

766
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,570
TAO, inbound contact.

767
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,911
Multiples on the same bearing.

768
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,286
- Vampire, vampire!
- Fast movers inbound.

769
01:23:18,493 --> 01:23:20,893
I got seven, eight, nine of them!

770
01:23:46,521 --> 01:23:49,251
The missiles definitely came
from Russian aircraft.

771
01:23:49,457 --> 01:23:52,824
Grennel thinks he can save the ship,
but flight ops are out.

772
01:23:55,497 --> 01:23:58,398
I ordered no such attack.

773
01:23:58,566 --> 01:24:01,228
You must not respond to this action
until we investigate all possibilities.

774
01:24:01,469 --> 01:24:03,699
"...until we investigate all possibilities."

775
01:24:03,905 --> 01:24:05,930
Like you did in Chechnya?

776
01:24:06,141 --> 01:24:09,440
Mr President, who is in control
of your armed forces?

777
01:24:11,913 --> 01:24:14,939
You dropped the bomb on Hiroshima.

778
01:24:15,150 --> 01:24:18,119
You dropped the bomb on Nagasaki.

779
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:21,115
Do not lecture me on Chechnya.

780
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:25,087
"...lecture me on Chechnya."

781
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:32,165
Mr President, we are now at a
de facto state of war with the Russians.

782
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:42,699
John Clark was in Haifa yesterday.
We have to find him right away.

783
01:24:42,911 --> 01:24:44,776
Wow.
Look at that gadolinium reading.

784
01:24:44,980 --> 01:24:47,540
Yeah. The mass fraction is huge.

785
01:24:47,749 --> 01:24:50,650
OK, connect me to Dillon. I'll hold.

786
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:55,289
There it is. Savannah River.

787
01:24:56,224 --> 01:24:58,715
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah, what?

788
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:00,587
They had a gadolinium problem.

789
01:25:00,795 --> 01:25:04,595
Hanford does it another way,
and generate too much promethium.

790
01:25:04,799 --> 01:25:07,290
Hold on. Can you translate that
into English?

791
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:13,573
This plutonium came from the DOE
plant at Savannah River, February '68,

792
01:25:13,775 --> 01:25:17,233
from K reactor. We even know
which part of K reactor.

793
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:21,973
- Wait. This is our plutonium?
- Made in the USA.

794
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,519
Dillon, you've got to find Cabot.

795
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:36,258
Are you advocating we launch
a first strike?

796
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:41,424
It is not a first strike! There's already
been a first strike, and a second.

797
01:25:41,636 --> 01:25:43,934
- Don't you get it?
- No, I don't get it!

798
01:25:44,139 --> 01:25:47,802
I don't understand why we have
to nuke them! It's not reasonable.

799
01:25:48,009 --> 01:25:50,102
Sidney, goddamn it!

800
01:25:50,311 --> 01:25:53,041
They practically sank
an aircraft carrier!

801
01:25:53,248 --> 01:25:56,877
Their missile silos are hot.
We're getting bullshit from Nemerov.

802
01:25:57,118 --> 01:26:01,953
Let's not forget how this started.
They tried to kill me, remember?

803
01:26:02,157 --> 01:26:04,125
Don't fucking tell me to be reasonable!

804
01:26:09,864 --> 01:26:13,857
Please come to the triage tent
on the side of the building.

805
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:17,038
We will help you find
who you are looking for,

806
01:26:17,238 --> 01:26:20,230
but we are low on blood supply.

807
01:26:47,302 --> 01:26:48,667
Sir?

808
01:26:50,705 --> 01:26:52,070
Sir?

809
01:26:53,408 --> 01:26:55,672
Hi.

810
01:26:58,346 --> 01:27:00,871
What?

811
01:27:01,082 --> 01:27:04,643
- President?
- The President's fine.

812
01:27:04,886 --> 01:27:07,548
He's fine. Sir...

813
01:27:08,456 --> 01:27:11,084
The bomb. The plutonium...

814
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:13,590
- Wife.
- What?

815
01:27:14,295 --> 01:27:15,592
Wife.

816
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:19,528
Your wife? I'm sure she's fine.
She's in DC.

817
01:27:19,734 --> 01:27:22,635
The blast radius wasn't that...

818
01:27:23,938 --> 01:27:24,906
...it wasn't that wide.

819
01:27:24,906 --> 01:27:25,930
...it wasn't that wide.

820
01:27:29,844 --> 01:27:31,869
Sir, listen to me.

821
01:27:32,814 --> 01:27:35,806
The plutonium was ours.

822
01:27:36,684 --> 01:27:41,917
John Clark's in Haifa to track down
the arms dealer. I can't get hold of him.

823
01:27:42,123 --> 01:27:44,421
I don't know what to do.

824
01:27:47,495 --> 01:27:50,396
Girl... girlfriend.

825
01:27:52,734 --> 01:27:54,167
She...

826
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,871
She works in Baltimore, so...

827
01:27:58,072 --> 01:27:59,835
...I don't know.

828
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,443
Spinnaker.

829
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:07,638
- What?
- Spinnaker.

830
01:28:12,187 --> 01:28:13,449
Sir?

831
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:16,653
Bill?

832
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:52,788
Yeah. We found the receiver address
for the crate.

833
01:28:52,994 --> 01:28:56,361
Port of Baltimore.
Can you get to the docks?

834
01:28:56,564 --> 01:29:00,796
Find the Transcon warehouse.
The name on the manifest is Mason.

835
01:29:01,603 --> 01:29:03,696
Sorry, I need this truck.

836
01:29:38,506 --> 01:29:39,803
Come on.

837
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:18,507
Shit.

838
01:31:22,977 --> 01:31:26,071
Sir, we've come up
with another alternative.

839
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:31,377
A conventional attack on the airbase
where the carrier attack originated.

840
01:31:31,619 --> 01:31:35,419
- It's a measured response.
- Non-nuclear.

841
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:39,582
- Is it strong enough?
- Smart bombs and F-16s.

842
01:31:39,827 --> 01:31:42,523
Can't afford for them to see us as weak.

843
01:31:42,730 --> 01:31:46,666
They've got to know we have the guts
to take it to the next level.

844
01:31:47,502 --> 01:31:49,470
I think they'll get that message.

845
01:31:54,075 --> 01:31:55,542
Hit 'em.

846
01:32:08,856 --> 01:32:13,293
Eagles Nest, this is Eagle One.
We have target acquired. Target is lit.

847
01:32:28,509 --> 01:32:31,410
To make no response
is to invite a greater attack.

848
01:32:31,612 --> 01:32:35,571
American submarines from Norfolk
and Kings Bay are putting to sea.

849
01:32:35,783 --> 01:32:41,312
They carry Trident D3 missiles.
A first strike weapon.

850
01:32:41,556 --> 01:32:44,047
Fowler is not so insane
as to launch a first strike.

851
01:32:44,292 --> 01:32:46,385
Perhaps he doesn't think
it's the first strike.

852
01:32:46,594 --> 01:32:50,530
Once their Stealth bombers go up,
we will have no choice.

853
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:52,562
That will be the sign.

854
01:32:52,767 --> 01:32:55,133
How do we convince him
not to launch his bombers?

855
01:32:55,336 --> 01:33:00,501
- Maybe we should...
- Bring our missiles to highest alert.

856
01:33:00,708 --> 01:33:04,235
They'd be crazy to attack then.

857
01:33:06,013 --> 01:33:08,174
Can I have your attention?

858
01:33:08,382 --> 01:33:11,010
The generator has gone out.

859
01:33:11,252 --> 01:33:16,155
There's broken glass everywhere. Stay
where you are. We will get back to...

860
01:33:16,357 --> 01:33:20,384
OK, fine. Please, stay where you are.
We'll get you one by one.

861
01:33:33,941 --> 01:33:38,537
Sir, can you hear me?
Can you feel your arms and legs?

862
01:33:38,746 --> 01:33:42,944
A 9% IV and morphine drip.
Sir, we're gonna take care of you.

863
01:33:43,184 --> 01:33:45,152
What have you got?

864
01:33:45,887 --> 01:33:48,356
What do we do with the ones
we know won't make it?

865
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:49,914
What do we do with the ones
we know won't make it?

866
01:33:50,157 --> 01:33:51,954
Whatever we can.

867
01:33:59,066 --> 01:34:00,363
What?

868
01:34:01,102 --> 01:34:03,127
Bill Cabot died.

869
01:34:07,808 --> 01:34:09,776
I'm really sorry.

870
01:34:11,679 --> 01:34:13,840
This can't be happening.

871
01:34:29,764 --> 01:34:32,597
Sir, we have a call from Langley.

872
01:34:33,901 --> 01:34:35,664
Thank you.

873
01:34:38,005 --> 01:34:40,200
- Becker.
- This is Jack Ryan.

874
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:42,638
Great. The Nemerov apologist.

875
01:34:44,312 --> 01:34:47,907
Sir, this bomb was not Nemerov.
I know this guy.

876
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:51,546
You said that after Grozny.
Put it in your report.

877
01:34:51,786 --> 01:34:53,151
The plutonium...

878
01:35:07,568 --> 01:35:11,368
Seems unusual to find
radiation poisoning here.

879
01:35:11,572 --> 01:35:13,665
I have never seen such a thing.

880
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:18,368
That is why we published the case
on the internet, to seek help.

881
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:22,640
- How did he say it happened?
- He will not talk about it.

882
01:35:31,692 --> 01:35:35,890
Was anyone else exposed
to the materials that made you sick?

883
01:35:41,869 --> 01:35:44,963
Mr Ghazi, I'm not the police.

884
01:35:45,973 --> 01:35:50,137
I'm a physician. I assure you
anything you say stays between us.

885
01:35:56,784 --> 01:36:00,515
My friend and I find bomb.

886
01:36:02,556 --> 01:36:06,720
We sell to a man
who buys such things.

887
01:36:10,798 --> 01:36:12,959
Was it this man?

888
01:36:19,473 --> 01:36:23,034
Other people may have come
in contact with that bomb.

889
01:36:24,178 --> 01:36:26,203
We must help them.

890
01:36:37,458 --> 01:36:41,724
I am... going to die?

891
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:43,260
Yes?

892
01:36:47,635 --> 01:36:48,932
Yes.

893
01:37:01,749 --> 01:37:05,310
His name is Olson.

894
01:37:08,189 --> 01:37:10,783
He live in Damascus.

895
01:37:29,243 --> 01:37:32,110
Oh, yeah. We're getting it all.

896
01:37:33,881 --> 01:37:38,250
A nuclear strike on Colorado Springs
would take out NORAD.

897
01:37:38,486 --> 01:37:41,944
It would limit their ability
to launch a counter-attack.

898
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:45,352
How many people live
in Colorado Springs?

899
01:37:46,494 --> 01:37:49,827
Three or four hundred thousand.

900
01:37:50,030 --> 01:37:53,898
Mr President, to use nuclear weapons
against the Americans...

901
01:37:54,101 --> 01:37:56,262
...would be to cross a threshold.

902
01:37:56,470 --> 01:38:02,875
They think we already have. Should
we now wait for them to annihilate us?

903
01:38:03,377 --> 01:38:07,973
I cannot stop what I did not start.

904
01:38:10,117 --> 01:38:13,245
Mr President, we need you
to initiate snapcount.

905
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:16,089
What happens then?

906
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:20,692
We prepare to take out their land-based
missiles with a nuclear strike,

907
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:25,491
find and kill their subs, knock out
the planes they have on the ground

908
01:38:25,699 --> 01:38:30,159
and mobilise our fighters to destroy
the ones they already have in the air.

909
01:38:31,305 --> 01:38:32,932
What are our chances?

910
01:38:33,841 --> 01:38:35,502
David?

911
01:38:37,912 --> 01:38:41,780
Odds are we leave Nemerov
in a pretty pickle.

912
01:38:41,982 --> 01:38:45,611
He'll be left with, at best,
a few hundred nukes,

913
01:38:45,853 --> 01:38:48,185
the ones we can't find.

914
01:38:48,389 --> 01:38:53,258
Mostly the... smaller, more mobile,
less accurate kind.

915
01:38:53,460 --> 01:38:56,054
All those can do is target our cities.

916
01:38:56,263 --> 01:39:00,632
But he knows to an absolute certainty
that we will respond against his cities.

917
01:39:06,907 --> 01:39:10,104
I spent my entire adult life
wanting to be president.

918
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:15,812
This is my presidency?

919
01:39:17,384 --> 01:39:22,344
Sir, I think he'll keep his 300 nukes as a
deterrent against any future aggressor.

920
01:39:22,590 --> 01:39:26,458
I think he'll push back from the table
and call it a night.

921
01:39:29,864 --> 01:39:33,960
I'm giving the order for snapcount.
Maximum readiness.

922
01:39:43,143 --> 01:39:48,482
Olson had wire payments of $45 million
from someone named Dressler.

923
01:39:48,482 --> 01:39:48,811
Olson had wire payments of $45 million
from someone named Dressler.

924
01:39:49,016 --> 01:39:52,918
Dillon, find out who Dressler is.
Jack, I want you out of there.

925
01:39:53,120 --> 01:39:56,248
- I'm at the docks.
- Look for the name Dressler.

926
01:39:56,490 --> 01:40:00,290
No. Jack, get out. Dillon, call the
Baltimore PD, give them the address.

927
01:40:00,494 --> 01:40:03,292
- Wait for the cops.
- I'll call you back.

928
01:41:28,115 --> 01:41:30,140
Who's Dressler?

929
01:41:34,388 --> 01:41:36,618
Where is he, goddamn it?

930
01:41:36,824 --> 01:41:39,486
Where is Dressler?

931
01:41:39,727 --> 01:41:42,287
Police! Put your hands up!

932
01:41:42,496 --> 01:41:44,930
- Where's Dressler?
- Are you Jack Ryan?

933
01:41:45,132 --> 01:41:48,829
- Where's Dressler, goddamn it?
- Let him go!

934
01:41:49,036 --> 01:41:52,062
Where's Dressler? Where is he?

935
01:41:55,509 --> 01:41:58,069
Langley said you might need help.

936
01:41:58,278 --> 01:42:01,475
- I gotta get to the Pentagon.
- I think I can help you with that.

937
01:42:22,169 --> 01:42:23,932
Mr President.

938
01:42:24,138 --> 01:42:27,232
Their Stealth bombers
have left Aviano.

939
01:42:29,510 --> 01:42:32,502
That is the sign.

940
01:42:32,713 --> 01:42:36,080
Shoot them down.

941
01:42:40,120 --> 01:42:42,213
God protect us.

942
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:46,987
Mr President, they're scrambling
their fighters. We're out of time.

943
01:42:50,664 --> 01:42:52,894
- Dave!
- He has a heart condition.

944
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:55,000
- Get a doctor.
- Mr President.

945
01:42:55,202 --> 01:42:57,170
- Where's your nitro?
- I said get a doctor!

946
01:42:57,371 --> 01:43:00,568
- Mr President.
- Take him to my quarters.

947
01:43:01,108 --> 01:43:03,633
Colonel, bring in the launch codes.

948
01:43:20,627 --> 01:43:23,721
Dressler's an Austrian manufacturer,
billionaire.

949
01:43:23,931 --> 01:43:26,422
His father was executed at Nuremberg.

950
01:43:26,633 --> 01:43:31,195
He bought a seat in parliament and got
booted out for saying pro-Nazi things.

951
01:43:31,405 --> 01:43:32,963
Rudy, get me through to the President.

952
01:43:33,173 --> 01:43:36,404
I can't do it, Jack.
They're in the snapcount.

953
01:43:36,610 --> 01:43:38,578
- There's no way in.
- Bullshit.

954
01:44:14,515 --> 01:44:18,542
- I can do that for you, sir.
- No, it's fine. Got some dirt on it.

955
01:44:18,785 --> 01:44:21,618
- Can I see it? We're on high alert.
- I understand.

956
01:44:21,822 --> 01:44:24,552
- Sir, put the card down.
- Back off.

957
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:27,056
- I am ordering you...
- Back off!

958
01:44:27,261 --> 01:44:32,289
Step back now! I am ordering
you to take a step back! Put...

959
01:44:43,844 --> 01:44:46,404
General, there's a Dr Ryan
from the CIA.

960
01:44:46,613 --> 01:44:49,138
He wants to enter NMCC.
He's unescorted.

961
01:44:49,349 --> 01:44:51,340
- What's he want?
- You, sir.

962
01:44:51,585 --> 01:44:57,490
I have a message from Director Cabot
that I need to transmit over the hotline.

963
01:44:57,691 --> 01:45:00,182
- What's your authorisation?
- I don't have one.

964
01:45:00,394 --> 01:45:02,988
- Where's Cabot?
- Cabot's dead, sir.

965
01:45:03,197 --> 01:45:08,032
- I need to get this information sent.
- Not without authorisation. Get him out.

966
01:45:08,235 --> 01:45:13,798
Wait! General! The President is basing
his decisions on bad information!

967
01:45:14,007 --> 01:45:17,238
If you shut me out,
your family and my family

968
01:45:17,444 --> 01:45:21,403
and 25 million other families
will be dead in 30 minutes.

969
01:45:27,654 --> 01:45:31,988
My orders are to get this information
to the people who make the decisions.

970
01:45:32,192 --> 01:45:35,286
I just need to send some information.

971
01:45:36,863 --> 01:45:39,388
What makes you think
the President will listen to you?

972
01:45:43,370 --> 01:45:45,361
He doesn't have to.

973
01:45:45,739 --> 01:45:47,900
How close are the bombers?

974
01:45:48,842 --> 01:45:54,906
They're slipping in and out of radar
over Poland.

975
01:45:59,019 --> 01:46:03,683
Activate the missile regiments.

976
01:46:10,964 --> 01:46:14,627
The launch sequence takes a minute
to process after you give the order.

977
01:46:14,835 --> 01:46:18,965
Before the order can be taken,
an ID check must be performed.

978
01:46:24,077 --> 01:46:27,706
Mine is the... My number is...

979
01:46:28,849 --> 01:46:31,716
...the third one... third number down
from the top.

980
01:46:32,486 --> 01:46:34,613
Your orders, sir?

981
01:46:34,855 --> 01:46:37,323
- Strike.
- I'm sorry, sir?

982
01:46:37,524 --> 01:46:39,924
I give the order to strike.

983
01:46:40,127 --> 01:46:44,496
Under the two-man rule, the order
to strike must now be confirmed.

984
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,868
Bob, for the love of God.

985
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:50,866
Just do it.

986
01:46:55,909 --> 01:47:00,039
Sidney Owens, Secretary of State.
It's the fourth number down.

987
01:47:09,556 --> 01:47:12,889
The order to strike has now been
confirmed by the two-man rule.

988
01:47:13,093 --> 01:47:17,359
NMCC, strike order has been
confirmed. Start the sequence.

989
01:47:17,564 --> 01:47:20,294
- We've got activity on the hotline.
- They've had their chance.

990
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:21,762
No, somebody's talking to the Kremlin.

991
01:47:28,475 --> 01:47:32,206
It says, "America has been the victim
of a terrorist attack."

992
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:36,939
As you can imagine, there has
been much confusion here...

993
01:47:37,584 --> 01:47:39,347
...and fear.

994
01:47:39,586 --> 01:47:42,612
But we know the weapon
was not Russian.

995
01:47:42,856 --> 01:47:46,257
"But we know the weapon
was not Russian."

996
01:47:46,460 --> 01:47:48,018
What the hell is going on?

997
01:47:55,435 --> 01:47:58,199
Type exactly what I say.

998
01:47:58,372 --> 01:48:01,000
Who are we talking to?

999
01:48:03,643 --> 01:48:09,309
Ryan. I met you in Moscow with
Bill Cabot. He died today in Baltimore.

1000
01:48:09,516 --> 01:48:12,576
- Cut him off.
- Launch sequence has begun.

1001
01:48:12,819 --> 01:48:14,286
Two months ago,

1002
01:48:14,554 --> 01:48:18,149
a neo-fascist named Dressler bought
an A-bomb on the black market.

1003
01:48:18,392 --> 01:48:22,055
- Cut him off.
- The system can't be cut off.

1004
01:48:22,262 --> 01:48:24,287
Then get someone to stop him.

1005
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:28,764
- He paid three disaffected Russian...
- "scientists to make the bomb active."

1006
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:31,870
"He shipped it to the US,
where a man named Mason"

1007
01:48:32,072 --> 01:48:36,668
was hired to deliver the bomb and
set our countries on a collision course.

1008
01:48:37,043 --> 01:48:41,207
This is madness. He is CIA.

1009
01:48:41,415 --> 01:48:44,646
We cannot hang our fate
on the word of their spy.

1010
01:48:44,885 --> 01:48:48,821
What is the harm of listening
a bit more?

1011
01:48:52,926 --> 01:48:55,588
What are you asking of me?

1012
01:49:04,638 --> 01:49:05,866
Back down.

1013
01:49:10,310 --> 01:49:14,007
What guarantee do I have that
President Fowler will follow suit?

1014
01:49:15,348 --> 01:49:16,906
None.

1015
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:23,286
You see? He is wasting time.

1016
01:49:23,490 --> 01:49:25,720
We must launch now.
We have only moments.

1017
01:49:28,161 --> 01:49:32,359
Sir, I know you had nothing to do
with the Baltimore bomb

1018
01:49:32,566 --> 01:49:37,026
and you know you didn't, but you're
still about to launch a nuclear strike.

1019
01:49:37,237 --> 01:49:40,570
- Yes, sir. That's all, Dr Ryan.
- This is about fear.

1020
01:49:40,774 --> 01:49:43,004
Fear of your missiles,
fear of our subs.

1021
01:49:43,210 --> 01:49:45,178
Fear of being weak,
of making a mistake,

1022
01:49:45,378 --> 01:49:49,542
the fear of the other guy that had us
build these bombs in the first place!

1023
01:49:53,019 --> 01:49:54,281
It stopped.

1024
01:49:57,424 --> 01:49:58,721
They cut him off.

1025
01:49:59,726 --> 01:50:01,159
They are going to strike.

1026
01:50:01,361 --> 01:50:04,455
Prepare the launch orders now.

1027
01:50:19,145 --> 01:50:20,942
30 seconds to launch.

1028
01:50:21,114 --> 01:50:23,275
Oh, my God. Mr President?

1029
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:36,390
We will maintain our defensive alert
for the moment,

1030
01:50:36,596 --> 01:50:39,360
but our offensive forces
are withdrawn.

1031
01:50:39,566 --> 01:50:44,230
"If you match this, I propose a phased
mutual stand down over five hours."

1032
01:50:46,339 --> 01:50:48,364
Stop the launch sequence.

1033
01:50:48,575 --> 01:50:52,306
Lasseter here. Flash override.
Stop the sequence!

1034
01:50:53,380 --> 01:50:57,009
Order the planes to stand down.
Take us to DEFCON-3.

1035
01:50:57,217 --> 01:51:01,119
And would somebody ask Mr Ryan
if I can use the phone now?

1036
01:51:30,984 --> 01:51:32,975
You're still here.

1037
01:54:44,944 --> 01:54:49,347
There is no more fitting memorial
for those who perished in this tragedy

1038
01:54:49,549 --> 01:54:51,744
than the steps we've taken this week

1039
01:54:51,985 --> 01:54:53,976
toward a multinational campaign

1040
01:54:54,220 --> 01:54:58,247
to root out and eliminate
weapons of mass destruction.

1041
01:54:59,592 --> 01:55:04,928
We embarked on this course because
we have learned, at too great a cost,

1042
01:55:05,131 --> 01:55:08,498
that if the most powerful weapons
ever created are unleashed,

1043
01:55:08,701 --> 01:55:12,637
they will be fired not in anger,
but in fear.

1044
01:55:12,839 --> 01:55:14,170
Dr Ryan.

1045
01:55:15,542 --> 01:55:17,373
Mr Grushkov.

1046
01:55:17,744 --> 01:55:21,407
It is... a lovely day.

1047
01:55:23,283 --> 01:55:24,773
Yeah.

1048
01:55:25,618 --> 01:55:30,078
- I'm sorry, this is...
- Dr Muller. How do you do?

1049
01:55:31,191 --> 01:55:33,455
Nice to meet you.

1050
01:55:35,094 --> 01:55:37,494
Why am I not surprised
you know her name?

1051
01:55:39,766 --> 01:55:42,997
Our friend William thought
I was a spy.

1052
01:55:43,203 --> 01:55:45,831
Of course, he could never prove it.

1053
01:55:48,107 --> 01:55:49,870
He never told me you were friends.

1054
01:55:51,010 --> 01:55:53,478
Maybe he didn't know you well enough.

1055
01:55:56,149 --> 01:55:58,879
He told me he had a source in Russia.

1056
01:56:01,154 --> 01:56:03,179
"To keep the back channels open?"

1057
01:56:05,124 --> 01:56:07,183
"In hopes of staving off disaster."

1058
01:56:07,427 --> 01:56:11,727
Kennedy said,
"Our most basic common link"

1059
01:56:11,931 --> 01:56:15,662
"is that we all inhabit
this small planet."

1060
01:56:17,270 --> 01:56:19,898
"We all breathe the same air."

1061
01:56:20,540 --> 01:56:25,034
"We all cherish our children's future..."

1062
01:56:25,545 --> 01:56:28,207
"...and we're all mortal."

1063
01:56:29,082 --> 01:56:34,247
I will miss... so very much
talking to William.

1064
01:56:36,222 --> 01:56:37,689
Me too.

1065
01:56:38,625 --> 01:56:42,083
Perhaps from time to time

1066
01:56:42,328 --> 01:56:44,956
you and I can talk.

1067
01:56:45,164 --> 01:56:47,496
Yeah, I'd like that.

1068
01:56:50,236 --> 01:56:51,533
What is this?

1069
01:56:52,705 --> 01:56:56,573
A modest gift for your engagement.

1070
01:56:58,845 --> 01:57:00,574
He... he just asked me this morning.

1071
01:57:00,780 --> 01:57:03,476
We haven't told anybody about it.

1072
01:57:04,751 --> 01:57:07,413
How... how could you possibly know?
