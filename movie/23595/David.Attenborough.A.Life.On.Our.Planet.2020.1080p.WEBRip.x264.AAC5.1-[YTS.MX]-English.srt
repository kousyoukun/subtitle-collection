152
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:17,552

198
00:18:48,638 --> 00:18:52,976

<i>and the entire ecosystem

200
00:18:58,815 --> 00:19:03,027
The point for me was simple:
the wild is far from unlimited.

201
00:19:03,111 --> 00:19:06,030
It's finite.
It needs protecting.

202

could actually watch it as it happened.

You saw a blue marble,

a blue sphere in the blackness,
and you realized that that was the earth.

218

the whole of humanity with nothing else

that some of these animals

<i>When I filmed with the mountain gorillas,</i>

<i>there were only 300 left

Baby gorillas were at a premium,

256

it was no longer acceptable.

<b><font color="#ca004b">[BIRDS CHIRPING]</font></b>

729
01:10:18,892 --> 01:10:23,104
<i>Just imagine if we achieve this
on a global scale.</i>

730
01:10:25,815 --> 01:10:28,151
The return of the trees would absorb

731
01:10:28,235 --> 01:10:31,321
as much as two thirds
of the carbon emissions

732
01:10:31,404 --> 01:10:35,533
that have been pumped into the atmosphere
by our activities to date.

733
01:10:43,124 --> 01:10:44,834
<i>With all these things,</i>

734
01:10:45,418 --> 01:10:48,088
<i>there is one overriding principle.</i>

735
01:10:51,007 --> 01:10:56,346
<i>Nature is our biggest ally
and our greatest inspiration.</i>

736
01:10:58,682 --> 01:11:02,686
<i>We just have to do what nature
has always done.</i>

737
01:11:04,312 --> 01:11:08,566
<i>It worked out the secret of life long ago.</i>

738
01:11:14,447 --> 01:11:18,451
<i>In this world,
a species can only thrive...</i>

739
01:11:19,869 --> 01:11:23,873
<i>when everything else
around it thrives, too.</i>

740
01:11:29,838 --> 01:11:32,674
<i>We can solve the problems we now face</i>

741
01:11:32,757 --> 01:11:35,719
<i>by embracing this reality.</i>

742
01:11:38,388 --> 01:11:40,807
<i>If we take care of nature,</i>

743
01:11:42,309 --> 01:11:45,312
<i>nature will take care of us.</i>

744
01:11:48,106 --> 01:11:53,486
<i>It's now time for our species
to stop simply growing.</i>

745
01:11:55,447 --> 01:12:00,785
<i>To establish a life on our planet
in balance with nature.</i>

746
01:12:03,621 --> 01:12:06,124
<i>To start to thrive.</i>

747
01:12:09,544 --> 01:12:13,381
When you think about it,
we're completing a journey.

748
01:12:14,924 --> 01:12:18,011
Ten thousand years ago,
as hunter-gatherers,

749
01:12:18,720 --> 01:12:23,058
we lived a sustainable life
because that was the only option.

750
01:12:24,100 --> 01:12:29,564
All these years later,
it's once again the only option.

751
01:12:29,647 --> 01:12:31,941
We need to rediscover...

752
01:12:33,026 --> 01:12:34,652
how to be sustainable.

753
01:12:34,736 --> 01:12:38,656
To move from being apart from nature

754
01:12:38,740 --> 01:12:43,328
to becoming a part of nature once again.

755
01:12:48,458 --> 01:12:51,336
Tonight, we've got
a rather different program for you.

756
01:12:54,214 --> 01:12:57,467
<b><font color="#cf685c">ATTENBOROUGH:</font></b> <i>If we can change
the way we live on Earth,</i>

757
01:12:58,468 --> 01:13:01,304
<i>an alternative future comes into view.</i>

758
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:06,393
<i>In this future,</i>

759
01:13:06,976 --> 01:13:13,441
<i>we discover ways to benefit from our land
that help, rather than hinder, wilderness.</i>

760
01:13:15,151 --> 01:13:21,116
<i>Ways to fish our seas that enable them
to come quickly back to life.</i>

761
01:13:27,705 --> 01:13:32,210
<i>And ways to harvest
our forests sustainably.</i>

762
01:13:35,839 --> 01:13:42,595
<i>We will finally learn how to work
with nature rather than against it.</i>

763
01:13:45,265 --> 01:13:49,727
In the end, after a lifetime's exploration
of the living world,

764
01:13:49,811 --> 01:13:52,105
I'm certain of one thing.

765
01:13:53,022 --> 01:13:55,984
This is not about saving our planet...

766
01:13:56,860 --> 01:13:59,446
it's about saving ourselves.

767
01:14:04,200 --> 01:14:10,540
<i>The truth is, with or without us,
the natural world will rebuild.</i>

768
01:14:20,467 --> 01:14:24,721
<i>In the 30 years
since the evacuation of Chernobyl,</i>

769
01:14:25,388 --> 01:14:29,017
<i>the wild has reclaimed the space.</i>

770
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:30,935
<b><font color="#ca004b">[BIRDS CHIRPING]</font></b>

771
01:14:40,278 --> 01:14:44,365
<i>Today, the forest has taken over the city.</i>

772
01:14:58,296 --> 01:15:03,009
<i>It's a sanctuary for wild animals
that are very rare elsewhere.</i>

773
01:15:09,724 --> 01:15:14,771
<i>And powerful evidence
that however grave our mistakes,</i>

774
01:15:14,854 --> 01:15:18,233
<i>nature will ultimately overcome them.</i>

775
01:15:22,737 --> 01:15:25,615
<i>The living world will endure.</i>

776
01:15:27,659 --> 01:15:31,412
<i>We humans cannot presume the same.</i>

777
01:15:34,249 --> 01:15:35,792
<i>We've come this far</i>

778
01:15:35,875 --> 01:15:39,712
<i>because we are the smartest creatures
that have ever lived.</i>

779
01:15:44,467 --> 01:15:49,180
<i>But to continue,
we require more than intelligence.</i>

780
01:15:51,224 --> 01:15:53,977
<i>We require wisdom.</i>

781
01:16:07,448 --> 01:16:11,911
There are many differences between humans
and the rest of the species on earth,

782
01:16:12,495 --> 01:16:17,792
but one that has been expressed is that
we alone are able to imagine the future.

783
01:16:19,127 --> 01:16:23,089
For a long time, I and perhaps you
have dreaded that future.

784
01:16:24,090 --> 01:16:28,678
But it's now becoming apparent
that it's not all doom and gloom.

785
01:16:29,762 --> 01:16:32,181
There's a chance for us to make amends,

786
01:16:32,932 --> 01:16:36,644
to complete our journey of development,
manage our impact,

787
01:16:36,728 --> 01:16:41,399
and once again become a species
in balance with nature.

788
01:16:42,483 --> 01:16:45,236
All we need is the will to do so.

789
01:16:45,737 --> 01:16:50,617
We now have the opportunity to create
the perfect home for ourselves,

790
01:16:51,159 --> 01:16:57,206
and restore the rich, healthy,
and wonderful world that we inherited.

791
01:16:58,541 --> 01:17:00,043
Just imagine that.
