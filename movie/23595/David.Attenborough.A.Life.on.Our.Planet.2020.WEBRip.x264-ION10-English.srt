<i>Immense grasslands.</i>

People had never seen pangolins
before on television.

The Maasai word "Serengeti"
means "endless plains."

To those who live here,
it's an apt description.

177
00:17:24,084 --> 00:17:26,754
You can be in one spot on the Serengeti,

178
00:17:26,837 --> 00:17:29,506
and the place is totally empty of animals,

179

188

<i>You can be forgiven for thinking</i>

190
00:18:07,377 --> 00:18:08,962
<i>It took a visionary scientist,</i>

191

<i>Bernhard Grzimek,</i>
<i>to explain that this wasn't true.</i>

<i>and over national borders.</i>

196
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,371
<i>They discovered that the Serengeti herds</i>

197
00:18:42,454 --> 00:18:47,376
<i>required an enormous area</i>
<i>of healthy grassland to function.</i>

198
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:52,965
<i>That without such an immense space,</i>
<i>the herds would diminish</i>

199
00:18:53,048 --> 00:18:57,010
<i>and the entire ecosystem</i>
<i>would come crashing down.</i>

200
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:03,016
The point for me was simple:
the wild is far from unlimited.

201
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:06,019
It's finite. It needs protecting.

202
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,149
And a few years later,
that idea became obvious to everyone.

<i>that any human had moved away</i>
<i>far enough from the earth</i>

<i>Our planet, vulnerable and isolated.</i>

211
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:59,489
<i>One of the extraordinary things about it</i>
<i>was that the world</i>

212
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:02,326
could actually watch it as it happened.

213
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:09,041
It was extraordinary that you could see
what a man out in space could see

214
00:20:09,124 --> 00:20:11,210
as he saw it at the same time.

215
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:16,840
And I remember very well that first shot.

216
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:20,093
You saw a blue marble,

217
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:26,642
a blue sphere in the blackness,
and you realized that that was the earth.

218
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:31,104
And in that one shot, there was
the whole of humanity with nothing else

219
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:35,734
except the person that was
in the spacecraft taking that picture.

220
00:20:36,735 --> 00:20:41,531
And that completely changed
the mindset of the population,

221
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:43,242
the human population of the world.

222

<i>Our home was not limitless.</i>

<i>There was an edge to our existence.</i>

224
00:20:54,795 --> 00:20:59,049
It was a rediscovery
of a fundamental truth.

225
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:04,346
We are ultimately bound by

<i>A world that demanded more every day.</i>

243
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:44,988
I spent the latter half of the 1970s
traveling the world,

244
00:22:45,072 --> 00:22:49,409
making a series I had long dreamed of
called <i>Life on Earth,</i>

<i>the story of the evolution of life</i>
<i>and its diversity.</i>

246
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,002
<i>It was shot in 39 countries.</i>

247
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:03,673
<i>We filmed 650 species,</i>

248
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:07,177
<i>and we traveled</i>
<i>one and a half million miles.</i>

249
00:23:07,844 --> 00:23:10,305
<i>That's the sort of commitment you need</i>

250
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:14,309
<i>if you want to even begin</i>
<i>making a portrait of the living world.</i>

251
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,395
But it was noticeable

252
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,649
that some of these animals
were becoming harder to find.

253
00:23:36,748 --> 00:23:39,417
<i>When I filmed with the mountain gorillas,</i>

254
00:23:39,501 --> 00:23:44,506
<i>there were only 300 left</i>
<i>in a remote jungle in Central Africa.</i>

255
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:48,426
Baby gorillas were at a premium,

256
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,721
and poachers would kill
a dozen adults to get one.

257
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:58,019
<i>I got as close as I did only because</i>
<i>the gorillas were used to people.</i>

258
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:05,110
<i>The only way to keep them alive</i>
<i>was for rangers to be with them every day.</i>

259
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:16,580
The process of extinction that I'd seen
as a boy... in the rocks,

260
00:24:17,581 --> 00:24:21,835
I now became aware was happening
right there around me

261

<i>It revealed a cold reality.</i>

265
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,064
Once a species became our target,

00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:47,068
there was now nowhere on earth
that it could hide.

<i>of industrial whaling ships in the 1970s.</i>

<i>The largest whales, the blues,</i>

01:11:29,827 --> 01:11:32,663
<i>We can solve the problems we now face</i>

741
01:11:32,746 --> 01:11:35,708
<i>by embracing this reality.</i>

742
01:11:38,377 --> 01:11:40,796
<i>If we take care of nature,</i>

743
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:45,300
<i>nature will take care of us.</i>

744
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:53,475
<i>It's now time for our species</i>
<i>to stop simply growing.</i>

745
01:11:55,436 --> 01:12:00,774
<i>To establish a life on our planet</i>
<i>in balance with nature.</i>

746
01:12:03,610 --> 01:12:06,113
<i>To start to thrive.</i>

747
01:12:09,533 --> 01:12:13,370
When you think about it,
we're completing a journey.

748
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:18,000
Ten thousand years ago,
as hunter-gatherers,

749
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:23,047
we lived a sustainable life
because that was the only option.

750
01:12:24,089 --> 01:12:29,553
All these years later,
it's once again the only option.

751
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,930
We need to rediscover...

752
01:12:33,015 --> 01:12:34,641
how to be sustainable.

753
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:38,645
To move from being apart from nature

754
01:12:38,729 --> 01:12:43,317
to becoming a part of nature once again.

755
01:12:48,447 --> 01:12:51,325
Tonight, we've got
a rather different program for you.

756
01:12:54,203 --> 01:12:57,456
[Attenborough] <i>If we can change</i>
<i>the way we live on Earth,</i>

757
01:12:58,457 --> 01:13:01,293
<i>an alternative future comes into view.</i>

758
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,382
<i>In this future,</i>

759
01:13:06,965 --> 01:13:13,430
<i>we discover ways to benefit from our land</i>
<i>that help, rather than hinder, wilderness.</i>

760
01:13:15,140 --> 01:13:21,105
<i>Ways to fish our seas that enable them</i>
<i>to come quickly back to life.</i>

761
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:32,199
<i>And ways to harvest</i>
<i>our forests sustainably.</i>

762
01:13:35,828 --> 01:13:42,584
<i>We will finally learn how to work</i>
<i>with nature rather than against it.</i>

763
01:13:45,254 --> 01:13:49,716
In the end, after a lifetime's exploration
of the living world,

764
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:52,094
I'm certain of one thing.

765
01:13:53,011 --> 01:13:55,973
This is not about saving our planet...

766
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:59,434
it's about saving ourselves.

767
01:14:04,189 --> 01:14:10,529
<i>The truth is, with or without us,</i>
<i>the natural world will rebuild.</i>

768
01:14:20,456 --> 01:14:24,710
<i>In the 30 years</i>
<i>since the evacuation of Chernobyl,</i>

769
01:14:25,377 --> 01:14:29,006
<i>the wild has reclaimed the space.</i>

770
01:14:29,089 --> 01:14:30,924
[birds chirping]

771
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:44,354
<i>Today, the forest has taken over the city.</i>

772
01:14:58,285 --> 01:15:02,998
<i>It's a sanctuary for wild animals</i>
<i>that are very rare elsewhere.</i>

773
01:15:09,713 --> 01:15:14,760
<i>And powerful evidence</i>
<i>that however grave our mistakes,</i>

774
01:15:14,843 --> 01:15:18,222
<i>nature will ultimately overcome them.</i>

775
01:15:22,726 --> 01:15:25,604
<i>The living world will endure.</i>

776
01:15:27,648 --> 01:15:31,401
<i>We humans cannot presume the same.</i>

777
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,781
<i>We've come this far</i>

778
01:15:35,864 --> 01:15:39,701
<i>because we are the smartest creatures</i>
<i>that have ever lived.</i>

779
01:15:44,456 --> 01:15:49,169
<i>But to continue,</i>
<i>we require more than intelligence.</i>

780
01:15:51,213 --> 01:15:53,966
<i>We require wisdom.</i>

781
01:16:07,437 --> 01:16:11,900
There are many differences between humans
and the rest of the species on earth,

782
01:16:12,484 --> 01:16:17,781
but one that has been expressed is that
we alone are able to imagine the future.

783
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:23,078
For a long time, I and perhaps you
have dreaded that future.

784
01:16:24,079 --> 01:16:28,667
But it's now becoming apparent
that it's not all doom and gloom.

785
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:32,170
There's a chance for us to make amends,

786
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:36,633
to complete our journey of development,
manage our impact,

787
01:16:36,717 --> 01:16:41,388
and once again become a species
in balance with nature.

788
01:16:42,472 --> 01:16:45,225
All we need is the will to do so.

789
01:16:45,726 --> 01:16:50,606
We now have the opportunity to create
the perfect home for ourselves,

790
01:16:51,148 --> 01:16:57,195
and restore the rich, healthy,
and wonderful world that we inherited.

791
01:16:58,530 --> 01:17:00,032
Just imagine that.
