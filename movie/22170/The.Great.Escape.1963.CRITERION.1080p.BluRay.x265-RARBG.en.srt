1
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,550
Go inside.

2
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:15,682
Hurry up. Go on.

3
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:17,893
This way.

4
00:05:20,111 --> 00:05:21,817
Go on.

5
00:05:24,783 --> 00:05:26,023
Hurry up.

6
00:05:37,587 --> 00:05:39,669
Ah. Yeah, this'll do.

7
00:05:40,507 --> 00:05:42,247
- Which one are you gonna have?
- Oh, I -

8
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,627
no, that's mine.

9
00:05:43,718 --> 00:05:46,004
Allez-up!

10
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,297
Over 200 feet.

11
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,049
Yeah, I'd say 300.

12
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:32,005
Long ways to dig.

13
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,143
We'll get cavendish to make a survey.
I wish big x were here.

14
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,596
Willie, you think x got away?

15
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:41,807
He'd have sent us word somehow if he had.

16
00:06:41,902 --> 00:06:43,688
Gestapo, you think?

17
00:06:43,778 --> 00:06:45,359
Either that or he's dead.

18
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,795
- Group captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

19
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:05,543
I am hauptfeldwebel strachwitz.

20
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:08,090
Will you accompany me, please?

21
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,214
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

22
00:07:23,026 --> 00:07:24,641
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

23
00:07:25,987 --> 00:07:27,602
Good morning, group captain.

24
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:31,280
I'm captain posen, Von luger's adjutant.

25
00:07:32,035 --> 00:07:35,277
Since you're senior British officer,
you are to be liaison

26
00:07:35,372 --> 00:07:37,829
between the prisoners and the colonel.

27
00:07:38,792 --> 00:07:41,499
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of, uh...

28
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,289
The word is "policy"?

29
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:45,666
Yes.

30
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:46,917
Thank you.

31
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,966
Come in.

32
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:03,096
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

33
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:06,941
I am colonel Von luger. Please sit down.

34
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:19,412
Group captain Ramsey,
in the past four years,

35
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,787
the reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

36
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,788
energy, manpower and equipment

37
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:27,871
hunting down
escaping prisoner-of-war officers.

38
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:31,083
Hmm. Well, at least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

39
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:34,131
For us, it's not a matter for levity.

40
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:37,006
There will be no escapes from this camp.

41
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:41,434
Colonel Von luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

42
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,137
If they can't,
it is their sworn duty to cause the enemy

43
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:46,974
to use an inordinate number of troops
to guard them

44
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,856
and their sworn duty to harass the enemy
to the best of their ability.

45
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:52,403
Yes, I know.

46
00:08:53,158 --> 00:08:56,195
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

47
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,953
This man, Ashley-pitt, for example.

48
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:03,498
Caught in the north sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

49
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:08,079
Archibald "Archie" ives:
11 escape attempts.

50
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:10,664
He even tried to jump out of the truck
coming here.

51
00:09:11,509 --> 00:09:13,090
Dickes, William.

52
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:17,133
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

53
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,681
Flight lieutenant velinski: Four escapes.
MacDonald: Nine.

54
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:23,977
Hendley, the American: Five.
Haynes: Four. Sedgwick: Seven.

55
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:25,804
The list is almost endless.

56
00:09:26,649 --> 00:09:30,483
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

57
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,652
Group captain, this is close to insanity.

58
00:09:32,739 --> 00:09:33,945
Quite.

59
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,696
And it must stop!

60
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:38,901
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

61
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:43,742
No.

62
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:48,327
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

63
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,338
This is a new camp.

64
00:09:53,176 --> 00:09:55,918
It has been built to hold you
and your men.

65
00:09:56,721 --> 00:10:00,179
It is organized to incorporate
all we have learned of security measures.

66
00:10:01,518 --> 00:10:04,510
And in me, you will not be dealing
with a common jailer...

67
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:09,018
But with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

68
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,849
by the luftwaffe high command.

69
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:16,522
We have in effect put all our rotten eggs
in one basket,

70
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,359
and we intend to watch this basket
carefully.

71
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,572
Very wise.

72
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:29,250
You will not be denied
the usual facilities:

73
00:10:30,213 --> 00:10:34,297
Sports, a library, a recreation hall.

74
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,922
And for gardening, we will give you tools.

75
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:41,547
We trust you to use them for gardening.

76
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,677
Devote your energies to these things.

77
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:46,726
Give up your hopeless attempts to escape.

78
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:50,684
And, with intelligent cooperation,

79
00:10:51,526 --> 00:10:53,357
we may all sit out the war...

80
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,608
As comfortably as possible.

81
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:18,671
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

82
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:22,128
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was kidding. I wasn't stealing tools.

83
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,635
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

84
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:27,263
Of course. Why do you come to Germany?

85
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,642
- Why fight for england, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

86
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:34,395
In 1812, they burned your capital.

87
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:36,297
- That's propaganda.
- It's in the history books.

88
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,232
- It's pure propaganda.
- I read it.

89
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,899
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

90
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,403
Yeah, no tools.

91
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:51,162
Hey, Virgil.

92
00:11:51,252 --> 00:11:53,493
Hey, did you see the cooler?

93
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,999
Boy, is it ever a big one.

94
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,331
I think they expect a lot of business.
Yeah.

95
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,135
Hey, those two guys who were with us
in the old camp, in hut 14 -

96
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:04,884
I can't find 'em. You think the goons
left 'em behind or something?

97
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,135
- I guess.
- Yeah. Hey, what were their names?

98
00:12:07,227 --> 00:12:09,138
It was Jackson and, uh...

99
00:12:09,646 --> 00:12:12,308
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

100
00:12:12,398 --> 00:12:15,014
Hey, I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.

101
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,670
Hey, Danny, who are they?

102
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:45,299
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

103
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,348
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

104
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,893
Willie, cigarettes.

105
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:17,043
Danny and I have a blitz in mind. Could
you put on a brief show for the goons?

106
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:20,167
- Sure, man. What'll it be? An all-out go?
- Mad prisoner?

107
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,715
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles, eh?

108
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:25,009
- Yeah, knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

109
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,344
What are you doing with my coat, mate?
“What? It's mine!

110
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:34,769
- Are you pushing me, you Canadian?
- That's mine, you aussie son of a...

111
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:37,938
Hey, that's mine!

112
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,859
You leave my jacket alone. It's my jacket!

113
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:04,003
I'll send you back
to the commonwealth!

114
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:07,589
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

115
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,386
It's all right. It's all right, mate.

116
00:14:09,474 --> 00:14:11,339
We're just
having a friendly little argument.

117
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:14,096
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

118
00:14:14,187 --> 00:14:16,018
- Get back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

119
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:17,265
You too!

120
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,391
Get away! Get back in your huts!

121
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,193
Go on!

122
00:14:57,313 --> 00:14:59,224
Hey, hilts. Hey.

123
00:14:59,315 --> 00:15:01,668
Looks like there's only one other
American in the whole camp:

124
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,899
Some guy named hendley
in the raf eagle squadron.

125
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,773
- Hey, you got something goin' already?
- Shh, shh!

126
00:15:06,864 --> 00:15:08,900
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

127
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:11,820
- Yeah.
- There's a blind spot in the middle.

128
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,533
A blind spot?

129
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:16,581
A guy could stand at that wire and not
be seen by that tower or that tower.

130
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:19,658
The one on the end is too far.
They'd never see me, especially at night.

131
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:23,336
- You're crazy.
- You think so? Let's find out right now.

132
00:15:40,815 --> 00:15:42,601
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

133
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:46,143
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.

134
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,814
I think I'll take a little walk.

135
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:55,989
March!

136
00:16:34,535 --> 00:16:37,242
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- A little, but only one sentence.

137
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:39,491
Let me have it, mate.

138
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:48,750
- What's it mean?
- "I love you."

139
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:52,504
"I love you"? What bloody good is that?

140
00:16:52,595 --> 00:16:54,961
I don't know.
I wasn't going to use it myself.

141
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:13,069
Halt!

142
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:21,905
Out. Out!

143
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:27,248
- Ah, your friend, yes?
- Huh?

144
00:17:27,338 --> 00:17:30,045
And who vouches for you,
lieutenant velinski?

145
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,331
Get out, Sedgwick.

146
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,128
Hold it, hold it!

147
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,759
- Your name?
- Ives.

148
00:18:18,431 --> 00:18:19,511
Ives.

149
00:18:20,558 --> 00:18:23,800
Ives. Oh, yes. Archibald ives. Scots.

150
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:26,894
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

151
00:18:26,981 --> 00:18:30,144
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

152
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:57,375
I will not take action against you now.

153
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,466
On both sides.

154
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:25,745
Hey! Get out!

155
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:29,786
Don't shoot!

156
00:19:33,506 --> 00:19:36,043
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

157
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,920
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

158
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:40,046
On.

159
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:42,844
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

160
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:46,595
Yeah, but my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

161
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,428
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, okay.

162
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,601
Gettin' my baseball.

163
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:55,434
Stop this nonsense!
Get over the wire immediately!

164
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,109
- Okay.
- You stay there!

165
00:19:57,697 --> 00:19:59,688
Out of the way. Out.

166
00:20:04,704 --> 00:20:06,695
What are you doing over here by the wire?

167
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:09,496
Like I told Max, I was trying to get -

168
00:20:21,095 --> 00:20:24,462
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...

169
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:28,432
I was trying to cut my way through
your wire because I wanna get out.

170
00:20:35,776 --> 00:20:37,732
- Do you speak German?
- Jawohl, herr oberst.

171
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:41,687
- Wire cutters.
- Jawohl, herr oberst.

172
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,864
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite
a number of British officers in this war,

173
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:49,995
and I flatter myself
that we understand one another.

174
00:20:57,339 --> 00:21:00,547
You are the first American officer
I have met. Hilts, isn't it?

175
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,590
Captain hilts, actually.

176
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,634
- Seventeen escape attempts.
- Eighteen, sir.

177
00:21:04,722 --> 00:21:07,885
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

178
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:11,308
I suppose what's called
in the American army a hotshot pilot.

179
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,395
Mm-hmm.

180
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,892
Unfortunately, you were shot down anyway,

181
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:17,769
so we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

182
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,771
Well, you speak for yourself, colonel.

183
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,531
You have other plans?

184
00:21:25,618 --> 00:21:28,155
I haven't seen Berlin yet
from the ground or from the air,

185
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:31,112
and I plan on doing both
before the war is over.

186
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,414
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

187
00:21:34,418 --> 00:21:36,204
Mmm, about 99 percent.

188
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:41,039
Then perhaps while you are with us,
you will have a chance to learn some.

189
00:21:41,133 --> 00:21:42,839
Ten days' isolation, hilts.

190
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:46,093
- Captain hilts.
- Twenty days.

191
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,920
Right.

192
00:21:49,642 --> 00:21:51,553
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out.

193
00:21:53,103 --> 00:21:54,263
Cooler.

194
00:22:03,405 --> 00:22:05,566
- Name?
- Ives.

195
00:22:05,658 --> 00:22:07,489
Flying officer ives.

196
00:22:07,576 --> 00:22:09,567
Cooler. Twenty days.

197
00:22:13,249 --> 00:22:15,331
- Cooler, lves.
- Pleasure.

198
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,260
Hilts. Yeah?

199
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:59,059
What did you do in the states?
Play baseball?

200
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,269
No, I was in college.

201
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,265
- Say, ives.
- Aye?

202
00:24:04,902 --> 00:24:08,986
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Oh, four over, seven under.

203
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:14,366
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.

204
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,827
How tall are you, ives?

205
00:24:18,749 --> 00:24:20,410
5'4". Why?

206
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:23,204
Oh, just wondering.

207
00:24:24,964 --> 00:24:28,377
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

208
00:24:28,926 --> 00:24:31,338
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

209
00:24:32,012 --> 00:24:33,012
Bicycles?

210
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:35,509
Motorcycles.

211
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,806
You know, flat tracks, county fairs.

212
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,225
Picked up a buck here and there.
Helped pay my tuition.

213
00:24:40,854 --> 00:24:43,061
Oh, I did a wee bit of racing myself.

214
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,854
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

215
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:48,438
No, horse racing. Jockey.

216
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:51,649
Jockey?

217
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:56,577
Jockey.

218
00:25:01,375 --> 00:25:02,410
Hilts?

219
00:25:03,961 --> 00:25:05,417
Are you there, hilts?

220
00:25:08,132 --> 00:25:09,338
Yeah, I'm here.

221
00:25:09,425 --> 00:25:11,791
Don't you have them in the states,
jockeys?

222
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:14,012
Sure.

223
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,212
They were the days.

224
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:20,424
Saturday nights in towns like
musselburgh and Hamilton.

225
00:25:21,061 --> 00:25:22,801
You had to fight off the birds.

226
00:25:23,689 --> 00:25:24,929
You know, birds.

227
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,644
Girls, man. Girls.

228
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,688
Do you not have them in the states?

229
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,272
Hilts?

230
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,861
Are you there, hilts?

231
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:39,617
Ives.

232
00:25:42,458 --> 00:25:43,664
What?

233
00:25:44,752 --> 00:25:47,744
You know the kind of Clay and gravel
we've got here in the compound?

234
00:25:47,838 --> 00:25:49,294
Aye.

235
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,293
How many feet do you think you could
get through in, say, eight hours?

236
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:56,886
I could cut through this dirt
here like the bit on an end of an auger.

237
00:25:57,806 --> 00:26:00,798
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood

238
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,758
and getting the dirt out.

239
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,389
That's what you have to worry about.

240
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,392
No, it isn't, ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

241
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:09,815
But how are you going to get the dirt out?

242
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,902
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

243
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,365
Aye.

244
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:21,239
Well, what do you think, Navy?

245
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:24,996
I must say,
it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

246
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:27,200
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

247
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,582
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

248
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,891
Eric.

249
00:26:50,651 --> 00:26:53,484
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

250
00:26:54,488 --> 00:26:56,604
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

251
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,074
He has arrived.

252
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,582
The prisoner bartlett is discharged
into your custody, colonel Von luger.

253
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,469
I suggest
this prisoner bartlett to be kept

254
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:28,052
under the strictest security confinement
permanently.

255
00:27:29,690 --> 00:27:32,727
- Make a note of herr kuhn's suggestion.
- Jawohl, herr oberst.

256
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,355
We have reason to believe
that this person is the leader

257
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,561
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

258
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:42,942
Squadron leader bartlett
has been three months in your care,

259
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,158
and the gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

260
00:27:47,249 --> 00:27:51,242
If he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

261
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:56,000
Air force officer prisoners
are the responsibility of the luftwaffe,

262
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:57,797
not the ss.

263
00:27:59,845 --> 00:28:01,460
Or the gestapo.

264
00:28:02,264 --> 00:28:04,505
At present, yes, herr oberst.

265
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,388
That is why he is returned
for the moment to your care.

266
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:11,140
Of course,
if the luftwaffe is not up to the task,

267
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:14,223
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

268
00:28:14,318 --> 00:28:17,151
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

269
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:24,111
Squadron leader bartlett...

270
00:28:25,662 --> 00:28:30,031
If you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

271
00:28:32,002 --> 00:28:33,367
- Hell Hitler.
- Hell Hitler.

272
00:28:33,462 --> 00:28:34,577
Hell Hitler.

273
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,002
Hell Hitler.

274
00:28:44,890 --> 00:28:46,050
Herr kuhn.

275
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:30,678
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

276
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:33,351
They dumped you here too.
Yes. What's this one like?

277
00:29:33,438 --> 00:29:35,303
Well, it's new.

278
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:39,225
Here. Let's find you a bed.

279
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,434
Thanks.

280
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,243
Come in.

281
00:30:01,091 --> 00:30:02,922
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

282
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:05,834
I'll put your bag in your room.

283
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:07,844
Thanks, Eric.

284
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:10,673
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

285
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:14,305
The fellows wanted to put up
a welcome committee, but that's for later.

286
00:30:14,396 --> 00:30:18,014
- Yes, I saw Willie and velinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

287
00:30:19,109 --> 00:30:21,896
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.

288
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:24,729
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

289
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:27,402
Have you met the commandant?

290
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:30,025
Yes, I did.

291
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,870
What were the gestapo
and the ss doing with you?

292
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:36,699
Oh, they wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.

293
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:38,909
- Who else is here? Cavendish?
- Mm-hmm.

294
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,916
- Nimmo and sorren?
- Griffith, haynes.

295
00:30:42,007 --> 00:30:43,497
- Blythe?
- Yes.

296
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,091
Almost the whole x organization.

297
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:48,259
Almost.

298
00:30:49,473 --> 00:30:52,260
They cleaned out all the other camps
and dumped us in this one.

299
00:30:52,351 --> 00:30:55,593
As Von luger put it,
"all the rotten eggs in one basket."

300
00:30:56,855 --> 00:31:00,188
There's madness in their method.
What about Tommy Bristol?

301
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,979
No, but there's an American, hendley.

302
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:07,563
Is he a scrounger? Blackmailer?

303
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,691
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

304
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:15,829
Last of the tea
until the red cross gets through again.

305
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,827
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

306
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,296
Did the gestapo give you a rough time?

307
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:29,297
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

308
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:34,514
Roger, personal revenge must be
kept out of what we have to do here.

309
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:37,051
Too many lives are at stake.

310
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:43,645
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

311
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:47,569
You appointed me big x, and it's my duty

312
00:31:47,656 --> 00:31:50,648
to harass, confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

313
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,905
- That's true.
- And that's what I intend to do.

314
00:31:55,789 --> 00:31:59,657
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this third reich of theirs

315
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:02,333
that thousands of troops
that could be employed to the front

316
00:32:02,421 --> 00:32:04,127
will be tied up here looking after us.

317
00:32:04,214 --> 00:32:05,454
How?

318
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:07,631
By putting more men out of this...

319
00:32:08,718 --> 00:32:11,585
Perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

320
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,843
Oh, not blitzing out two or three
or a dozen, but 200, 300.

321
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:16,673
Scatter them all over Germany.

322
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,122
- Do you think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

323
00:32:19,146 --> 00:32:22,354
The goons have put every escape artist
in this camp. You said so yourself.

324
00:32:23,984 --> 00:32:26,521
Have you thought of what it might cost?

325
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:32,732
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

326
00:32:33,535 --> 00:32:35,196
knuckle under and crawl.

327
00:32:35,996 --> 00:32:37,987
Surely you don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

328
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:41,999
I have to point out one thing to you,
Roger.

329
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,122
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

330
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,376
the high command have still left us
in the hands of the luftwaffe,

331
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:50,298
not the gestapo and the ss.

332
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,969
Look, sir, you, uh - you talk about

333
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:58,219
the high command and the luftwaffe,
then about the ss and the gestapo.

334
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,268
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

335
00:33:02,439 --> 00:33:04,225
There's only one way to put it, sir.

336
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:07,433
They are the common enemies
of everyone who believes in freedom.

337
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,194
If the high command didn't approve
of Hitler, why didn't they throw him out?

338
00:33:11,281 --> 00:33:13,021
I have no argument with you, Roger.

339
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:17,743
As senior officer,
I'm merely pointing out a pertinent fact.

340
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,741
When are you calling a meeting, x?

341
00:33:32,052 --> 00:33:33,167
Tonight.

342
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,513
Gentlemen,

343
00:33:46,608 --> 00:33:50,817
no doubt you've heard the immortal words
of our new commandant:

344
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,862
"Devote your energies to things
other than escape

345
00:33:53,949 --> 00:33:56,907
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible."

346
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:58,824
Hal

347
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,244
well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

348
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:05,365
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

349
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:08,327
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

350
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,787
In fact,
we're going to put the goons to sleep.

351
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:14,962
Meanwhile, we dig.

352
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:19,630
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound

353
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,887
shows us that huts 104 and 105
are closest to the woods.

354
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:25,390
The first tunnel goes out from 105

355
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:28,517
directly east under the vorlager,
the cooler and the wire.

356
00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:30,769
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

357
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:33,818
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

358
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,861
I make it just over 335 feet.

359
00:34:35,949 --> 00:34:37,780
Let me know when you've got an exact one.

360
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:41,655
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

361
00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:44,328
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

362
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:48,454
All right, Roger.
But did you say the first tunnel?

363
00:34:48,545 --> 00:34:51,252
I did. There'll be three.

364
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:57,213
We'll call them Tom, dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104,

365
00:34:57,304 --> 00:34:59,295
dick goes north from the kitchen,

366
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:02,176
and Harry goes out parallel to Tom
from 105.

367
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:07,010
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

368
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,146
How many men do you plan to take out,
Roger?

369
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,933
Two hundred and fifty.

370
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:15,965
There'll be no half measures this time,
gentlemen.

371
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,605
There'll be identification papers
and documents for everyone.

372
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,783
And, griff,
we'll need outfits for the lot.

373
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:24,703
- Two hundred and fifty?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

374
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,325
Yes, but, uh...

375
00:35:28,209 --> 00:35:29,665
Okay, Roger.

376
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:34,463
Mac, maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers,

377
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:36,130
and timetables for every train.

378
00:35:36,217 --> 00:35:38,173
Right, Roger.

379
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,217
Sorry I'm late, Roger.

380
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:47,016
It's all right, Colin. Sit down.
We're going to tunnel.

381
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:50,596
Splendid.

382
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:54,795
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.

383
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,435
I'll work out the exact location
with you tomorrow.

384
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,647
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

385
00:36:00,742 --> 00:36:02,607
Nimmo and haynes, diversions.

386
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,988
Mac, of course,
will take care of intelligence.

387
00:36:05,789 --> 00:36:08,326
Hendley. We haven't met.

388
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:09,872
- Scrounger?
- Right.

389
00:36:11,378 --> 00:36:13,790
Dennis, maps and surveys.

390
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,836
Colin, you'll take your usual job.

391
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,611
Eric, have you thought
how you're gonna get rid of this dirt?

392
00:36:18,635 --> 00:36:21,001
Yes, I have. Usual places.

393
00:36:21,096 --> 00:36:23,508
Hadn't anticipated three tunnels,
but we'll manage.

394
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:26,931
Roger, who's gonna handle security
for all this?

395
00:36:27,018 --> 00:36:28,133
You are.

396
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,228
I want a system of stooges covering
this compound from front to back,

397
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:35,182
checking every goon in and out.

398
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:37,892
I want a signal system so perfect

399
00:36:37,987 --> 00:36:41,133
that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet
of any of the huts in which we're working,

400
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:43,113
we can shut down without a sign.

401
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:49,117
Well, I don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

402
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,289
I'll meet each of you
on the exercise circuit,

403
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:53,708
and we'll pound out the details.

404
00:36:56,673 --> 00:36:58,038
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

405
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,540
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

406
00:37:26,745 --> 00:37:27,825
Oh, hello.

407
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:30,453
My name's blythe.

408
00:37:31,833 --> 00:37:32,833
Hendley.

409
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:40,626
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.

410
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,833
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

411
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:46,962
Oh, a bird-watcher?

412
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,765
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and, uh, drawing them.

413
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,820
I suppose you have bird-watchers
in the states?

414
00:37:55,899 --> 00:37:58,356
Yes, we have some.

415
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,024
Tea?

416
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,646
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.

417
00:38:06,743 --> 00:38:08,529
Where's your kit?

418
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:12,158
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

419
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:17,659
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

420
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,964
Such as.

421
00:38:23,051 --> 00:38:26,760
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

422
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:29,303
I'll need a camera.

423
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,265
- What kind?
- A good one.

424
00:38:33,353 --> 00:38:35,890
A 35-millimeter f/2.8

425
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:38,596
with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

426
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,693
- All right.
- And film, of course.

427
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,980
Oh, of course.

428
00:38:47,075 --> 00:38:50,693
Oh, hendley. I need a pick.
Big, heavy one.

429
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,823
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

430
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,622
I'm afraid this tea is pathetic.

431
00:39:00,421 --> 00:39:03,584
I must have used these wretched leaves
about 20 times.

432
00:39:04,634 --> 00:39:06,499
It's not that I mind so much.

433
00:39:07,262 --> 00:39:09,594
Tea without milk is so uncivilized.

434
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:11,720
Yeah.

435
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,216
I'll get our wood.

436
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,857
Close up! Close up!

437
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,075
Close up!

438
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:37,371
Close up! Hmm?

439
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:39,995
- Close up! Close up!
- No me sprechen sie english.

440
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,201
Close up!

441
00:40:05,028 --> 00:40:06,028
On.

442
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,027
Splendid.

443
00:40:21,294 --> 00:40:22,784
Blythe, what are you doing here?

444
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,835
Hmm? Oh.

445
00:40:24,923 --> 00:40:28,791
I'm in photographic aerial
reconnaissance interpretation.

446
00:40:28,885 --> 00:40:32,719
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

447
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:34,716
The aircraft bought it.

448
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:37,549
Got shot down. Terrifying.

449
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:40,843
No, I mean, what do you do here?

450
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:42,564
Here?

451
00:40:43,483 --> 00:40:46,099
Oh. I'm the forger.

452
00:41:06,673 --> 00:41:09,756
The forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

453
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,457
- Sedgwick?
- I'min 110.

454
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:14,919
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

455
00:41:15,014 --> 00:41:17,380
1097? Right.

456
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:18,885
I'll work in 107.

457
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,935
For now, Danny and Willie
and their trap team will be in 104.

458
00:41:22,021 --> 00:41:24,262
Mac, I want to take a chance
on the tunnels

459
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,313
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

460
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:29,564
But we will need timber, of course,
for the shafts and the entrance chambers.

461
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:32,361
Now, hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

462
00:41:32,448 --> 00:41:35,906
We can tear up 15 and move the men back
and forth so the goons won't miss them.

463
00:41:35,994 --> 00:41:38,594
The rest will come from strips
off the wall, as we've always done.

464
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:41,325
- Is hendley taking care of this himself?
- Not yet.

465
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:44,453
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

466
00:42:02,437 --> 00:42:05,019
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

467
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,472
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

468
00:42:07,567 --> 00:42:10,525
Get away!

469
00:42:11,654 --> 00:42:14,020
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

470
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,776
Turn the water off!

471
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,482
Stop this nonsense!

472
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,447
Will you turn it off?

473
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:24,531
Get away, here! Turn the water off!
Somewhere!

474
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,797
Turn the main valve off somewhere.

475
00:43:04,874 --> 00:43:07,957
In the stove, we keep fire burning always.

476
00:43:08,044 --> 00:43:10,160
This way,
the goons will not feel like moving it.

477
00:43:10,254 --> 00:43:11,619
- Good.
- Hendley -

478
00:43:12,924 --> 00:43:15,210
two tiles, they are chipped.
We need new ones.

479
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:19,419
There's some in 113's washroom.
Should match perfectly.

480
00:43:19,514 --> 00:43:20,549
Good.

481
00:43:28,815 --> 00:43:30,726
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

482
00:43:32,693 --> 00:43:34,729
Not when you're organized, Mac.

483
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:41,733
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

484
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:45,070
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

485
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:53,122
Good luck to us, Danny.

486
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,765
Why 177?

487
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:17,143
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

488
00:44:49,604 --> 00:44:51,094
- All right?
- Lovely.

489
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:07,697
It's good.

490
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:18,754
It's very good.

491
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,550
Haynes.

492
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,454
Get out! Get out!

493
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,230
- Come out here!
- Out, out, out!

494
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,727
- Here!
- Out, out, out!

495
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:24,854
You're not in your hut.

496
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:27,565
- What are you doing here?
- Mopping up.

497
00:46:32,081 --> 00:46:34,948
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

498
00:46:39,130 --> 00:46:42,167
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

499
00:46:46,637 --> 00:46:49,253
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

500
00:47:25,134 --> 00:47:26,624
Aus'

501
00:47:38,314 --> 00:47:40,305
No, no. I vote no.

502
00:47:40,941 --> 00:47:43,227
Look, we've put the goons to sleep
exactly like you said.

503
00:47:43,319 --> 00:47:45,964
But just one thing like this,
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

504
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,230
“We -
ah. Ives, sit down, won't you?

505
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:51,615
- Hello, sir.
- Hello.

506
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,943
- Squadron leader bartlett, captain hilts.
- Hi.

507
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,074
- Flight lieutenant MacDonald.
- Hi

508
00:47:56,957 --> 00:48:00,074
I, uh, understand
you two are contemplating a blitz-out.

509
00:48:00,169 --> 00:48:02,455
Where'd you hear that, sir?

510
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:05,253
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

511
00:48:05,341 --> 00:48:07,548
- Oh.
- We, um -

512
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,546
we thought perhaps we might talk it over.

513
00:48:09,637 --> 00:48:11,343
Why? It's only a two-man job.

514
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:15,716
Everybody in the camp is supposed to
clear all escape attempts in advance

515
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,176
with squadron leader bartlett here.

516
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:21,637
We, uh, don't necessarily
want to interfere. It's just that -

517
00:48:22,775 --> 00:48:25,938
well, what sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

518
00:48:26,028 --> 00:48:30,067
Well, we sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire, a blind spot.

519
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,364
Then we dig down three feet,
take the dirt,

520
00:48:32,451 --> 00:48:35,568
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,
and then - straight out.

521
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:38,245
Ives here is a tunnel man,
so he digs in front,

522
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:41,199
pushes the dirt behind him,
and I stash it behind me.

523
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,500
Then we burrow through the dirt
like a couple of moles.

524
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:46,579
Then by dawn we're under the wire,
across the open space,

525
00:48:46,674 --> 00:48:48,585
into the woods and gone.

526
00:48:54,807 --> 00:48:55,887
Well, uh...

527
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:01,602
When do you intend to try this?
Hmm?

528
00:49:01,689 --> 00:49:04,055
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

529
00:49:04,150 --> 00:49:06,607
Uh, hilts,

530
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:09,777
this may not be quite the right time
for this sort of thing.

531
00:49:09,864 --> 00:49:13,152
Look, sir, I've been in the bag
nearly three years now,

532
00:49:13,242 --> 00:49:15,654
bloody close to being wire-happy.

533
00:49:15,744 --> 00:49:17,985
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

534
00:49:18,873 --> 00:49:21,535
It'll work. I know it will.

535
00:49:29,675 --> 00:49:30,790
Good luck.

536
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,542
Thank you.

537
00:49:35,181 --> 00:49:39,470
- Hilts, um, how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it,

538
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:42,393
and we shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.

539
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,061
Good night, sir.

540
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:52,982
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

541
00:49:53,073 --> 00:49:55,530
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

542
00:49:56,619 --> 00:49:59,736
Oh, but it'll bring every goon in the camp
down on top of us.

543
00:49:59,830 --> 00:50:02,287
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

544
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:04,410
If we stop all the breakouts,

545
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:07,289
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunneling.

546
00:50:08,047 --> 00:50:10,083
I hope it works.

547
00:50:10,174 --> 00:50:13,587
If it doesn't, those two are gonna be
in the cooler for an awful long time.

548
00:50:59,557 --> 00:51:00,797
Good, huh?

549
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:02,677
Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

550
00:51:08,857 --> 00:51:12,020
- This is the dirt from the compound.
- This is from the tunnel.

551
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:21,650
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

552
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,866
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

553
00:51:24,957 --> 00:51:26,948
No, it's the first place
the ferrets would look.

554
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,158
I saw one measuring the height
under a hut yesterday.

555
00:51:29,253 --> 00:51:31,118
Maybe we could dry it out
to the same color.

556
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:35,752
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

557
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,084
If you must think,
for god's sake, think clearly.

558
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:42,050
Where the devil is Ashley-pitt?

559
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:46,471
We can't destroy the dirt,
and we can't eat it.

560
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:49,811
The only thing left to do
is camouflage it.

561
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:53,140
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

562
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:56,777
Didn't they teach you promptness
in the rn?

563
00:51:56,864 --> 00:51:59,230
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

564
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:04,198
The problem is somehow to get rid of
this tunnel dirt over the compound.

565
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:05,778
Well, of course.

566
00:52:06,999 --> 00:52:08,409
Would you mind?

567
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:20,001
Now...

568
00:52:22,681 --> 00:52:25,388
You fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

569
00:52:26,060 --> 00:52:29,644
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

570
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:31,891
you wander out into the compound,

571
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,566
where you pull these strings
in your pockets.

572
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,602
Out come the pins.

573
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:43,490
Eric, it's good.

574
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,990
All you have to do is kick it in.

575
00:52:47,081 --> 00:52:49,868
Unless you're a complete fool,
the ferrets will never see a thing.

576
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:53,166
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger, eh?

577
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:55,835
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

578
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:02,009
Mac, this is what we'll do.

579
00:53:16,652 --> 00:53:19,735
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Ah, thank you, nimmo.

580
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:30,161
- Nice garden you've got, sir.
- Mm.

581
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,489
Carry on.

582
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:05,068
All right, let's look sharp!

583
00:54:12,416 --> 00:54:13,622
That looks sharp.

584
00:54:18,297 --> 00:54:19,707
Sir.

585
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:27,177
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

586
00:54:42,613 --> 00:54:45,104
- Good morning, squadron leader.
- Good morning, sir.

587
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:49,442
I am sorry the soil here
isn't better suited to your men's purpose.

588
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,026
We'll manage, sir.

589
00:55:00,923 --> 00:55:05,257
I must say I am surprised with the extent
of this activity, group captain.

590
00:55:05,344 --> 00:55:08,427
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, colonel?

591
00:55:08,514 --> 00:55:11,256
Fliers are gentlemen,

592
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,591
not peasants to dig in the earth.

593
00:55:13,685 --> 00:55:15,141
So I am surprised.

594
00:55:15,229 --> 00:55:17,641
The english have always been
very keen on gardening.

595
00:55:17,731 --> 00:55:21,269
Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?

596
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:24,438
You can't eat flowers, colonel.

597
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:27,775
Good point.

598
00:55:45,884 --> 00:55:49,126
You know, I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

599
00:55:49,221 --> 00:55:52,384
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

600
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,510
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

601
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,896
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

602
00:56:08,991 --> 00:56:11,698
Here we are. Now, let's see.

603
00:56:12,494 --> 00:56:14,280
Biscuits, two packets.

604
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,699
Coffee, two tins.

605
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,035
Bovril, one jar.

606
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:22,163
Cigarettes, six packets.

607
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:25,921
Strawberry jam, sorren's.
Blackcurrant jam, cavendish.

608
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,041
And marmalade, mine.

609
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:32,754
Danish butter, Von luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

610
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:35,430
Oh, yes. And, uh -

611
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:38,224
and Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

612
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:42,812
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organization.

613
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:46,142
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

614
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:49,194
The forgers have no idea what
it looks like and can't move without it.

615
00:56:49,281 --> 00:56:50,646
I'll see what I can do.

616
00:56:50,741 --> 00:56:54,279
And, of course, any other identity cards,
personal papers,

617
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,610
documents you can put your hands on.

618
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,241
Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.

619
00:56:58,332 --> 00:56:59,447
- Right.
- Good luck.

620
00:57:08,884 --> 00:57:13,173
& o come, all ye faithful &

621
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,175
j joyful and triumphant j

622
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:20,134
j o come ye, o come ye &

623
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:24,062

624
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,812
I come and behold him &

625
00:57:27,903 --> 00:57:31,111

626
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:34,782
I o come, let us adore him j

627
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:38,156
I o come, let us adore him j

628
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:43,081
I o come, let us adore him... j

629
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:45,784
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

630
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:49,121
- Oh, Patience is a virtue, Roger.
- Yes, I know, dear boy.

631
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,707
But the diggers can only work
when the trap's open,

632
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:53,963
and this is holding us up very badly.

633
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,263
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

634
00:57:58,350 --> 00:58:01,012
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

635
00:58:01,103 --> 00:58:04,015
- But when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

636
00:58:04,773 --> 00:58:06,183
Does it work?

637
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,559
Of course it works.

638
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:11,102
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

639
00:58:12,114 --> 00:58:13,114
Mac?

640
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:14,984
Excellent.

641
00:58:16,410 --> 00:58:17,900
Have it in by tomorrow night.

642
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:23,705
I Christ the lord &

643
00:58:29,965 --> 00:58:31,546
Got a light?

644
00:58:31,633 --> 00:58:32,748
Oh, yeah.

645
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:36,547
Thanks.

646
00:58:37,305 --> 00:58:39,216
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

647
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:50,023
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

648
00:58:52,612 --> 00:58:55,775
I'll smoke it later, when I'm off duty.
Thank you.

649
00:58:55,866 --> 00:58:58,448
You probably have
a couple of roommates, huh?

650
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:01,618
Beautiful day.

651
00:59:01,705 --> 00:59:04,742
Yes.
But I think it might rain later.

652
00:59:04,833 --> 00:59:06,118
No, no.

653
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:09,667
Uh, red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

654
00:59:09,755 --> 00:59:11,871
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

655
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,001
It was a red sky last night.

656
00:59:14,092 --> 00:59:16,048
I never heard that before.

657
00:59:16,136 --> 00:59:17,876
I learned it in the boy scouts.

658
00:59:18,555 --> 00:59:20,011
- You were a boy scout?
- Mm-hmm.

659
00:59:20,098 --> 00:59:21,133
- So was I.
- Really?

660
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:24,216
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

661
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:29,058
I was working on my 20th
when the government abolished scouting

662
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:31,856
and sent me into the Hitler youth instead.

663
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,396
Hey, Werner,

664
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:39,982
you think you'll stay in the army
after the war?

665
00:59:40,077 --> 00:59:42,910
Oh, no. No. I'm not a well man.

666
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:44,827
My teeth. Your teeth?

667
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:48,157
Yes. Ah, I could tell you stories
about my teeth

668
00:59:48,251 --> 00:59:50,207
that would make your hair stand on end.

669
00:59:50,295 --> 00:59:52,001
Our dentist here is a butcher.

670
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,872
But don't tell anyone I said so.

671
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,171
It's a soldier's right to complain.

672
01:00:00,013 --> 01:00:01,969
Maybe in your army, but here?

673
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,803
One little criticism, and - zzzt!

674
01:00:05,894 --> 01:00:07,430
To the Russian front.

675
01:00:07,521 --> 01:00:08,931
Is that so?

676
01:00:09,731 --> 01:00:10,731
Terrible.

677
01:00:11,817 --> 01:00:13,353
That's terrible.

678
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,317
Werner...

679
01:00:23,703 --> 01:00:26,285
Why don't we go into my room,
where we can talk more comfortably.

680
01:00:26,373 --> 01:00:27,988
I'd better not.

681
01:00:28,083 --> 01:00:30,449
If strachwitz should see me - zzzt!

682
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:33,873
I was just gonna make some coffee.

683
01:00:36,508 --> 01:00:38,248
Some real coffee.

684
01:01:07,205 --> 01:01:09,196
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

685
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,740
Where is it?

686
01:01:18,300 --> 01:01:20,586
Well, my grandmother
keeps sending me this stuff.

687
01:01:27,142 --> 01:01:29,098
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

688
01:01:37,736 --> 01:01:39,818
Yeah. Keep it.

689
01:01:39,905 --> 01:01:42,772
- Nein. I must go.
- Werner, Werner -

690
01:01:42,866 --> 01:01:45,323
it's okay. You can keep it. We're friends.

691
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:48,618
With you in the cooler, will we
still be friends? I must report this.

692
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,787
I don't understand you, Werner.
Report what?

693
01:01:50,874 --> 01:01:53,160
That you and I were chatting in my room?

694
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:56,080
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's okay.

695
01:01:56,171 --> 01:01:57,581
- Look, keep it.
- No! No!

696
01:01:57,672 --> 01:01:59,942
I'll never be able to eat it all.
I've got all I could eat.

697
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:02,628
I'm sorry. All right.

698
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:04,129
Forget it. Forget it.

699
01:02:36,253 --> 01:02:40,587
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the nelles warbler.

700
01:02:40,674 --> 01:02:42,756
Now let's turn our attention
to this, gentlemen.

701
01:02:42,842 --> 01:02:45,925
The masked shrike.
Llanius nubicus. The butcher-bird.

702
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:50,263
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of Thorn bushes.

703
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,511
Not a very lovable character, you see.

704
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:54,263
Let's have a look at the coloring.

705
01:02:54,354 --> 01:02:57,767
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

706
01:02:57,857 --> 01:03:00,644
A black rump,
a black crown with a bold white flash,

707
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:03,101
and a white line over the eye.

708
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:05,312
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country...

709
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:10,112
Ah, hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

710
01:03:11,079 --> 01:03:13,286
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country,

711
01:03:13,373 --> 01:03:15,034
olive groves and gardens.

712
01:03:15,125 --> 01:03:17,707
Well, herr hendley,
have you taken to birds too now?

713
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:20,376
Yeah. You should stick around.
You might learn something.

714
01:03:20,463 --> 01:03:22,875
I have better things to do
than draw birds.

715
01:03:24,092 --> 01:03:28,005
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

716
01:03:29,472 --> 01:03:32,760
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

717
01:03:54,372 --> 01:03:56,328
- Permission to cross a frontier.
- Good.

718
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,032
Here's another one.
Which one's the forgery?

719
01:03:59,127 --> 01:04:00,287
Uh,

720
01:04:01,254 --> 01:04:02,334
that one.

721
01:04:02,422 --> 01:04:05,164
- That's right.
- They both are.

722
01:04:05,967 --> 01:04:08,834
What's holding us up now
is the new form of this travel permit.

723
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:11,840
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Uh, here's one.

724
01:04:13,558 --> 01:04:16,015
And a military identity card.

725
01:04:17,145 --> 01:04:18,601
And a...

726
01:04:18,688 --> 01:04:20,098
An auswels. Yeah.

727
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:22,055
Permission to be on reich property.

728
01:04:22,150 --> 01:04:24,357
A ticket to oden.

729
01:04:24,444 --> 01:04:28,278
What appears to be the ferret assignments
by day and hour for the next week.

730
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,610
You get ten out of ten for this, old boy.

731
01:04:31,701 --> 01:04:35,068
- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

732
01:04:35,163 --> 01:04:37,449
You - it's on loan.

733
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:42,876
Now, in order to get
the right amount of outfits, Roger,

734
01:04:42,962 --> 01:04:46,420
I suggest that we work mainly
from service uniforms.

735
01:04:46,508 --> 01:04:50,376
Now, I can do
double-breasteds, single-breasteds,

736
01:04:50,470 --> 01:04:53,382
and, uh, rather nice lounge suits.

737
01:04:53,473 --> 01:04:56,089
Lapels.
I can do quite a lot of things with those.

738
01:04:56,184 --> 01:05:00,928
I can have them deep like that
or high ones like that.

739
01:05:01,022 --> 01:05:02,137
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

740
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,349
Here's one that, uh,
we're working on right now.

741
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:07,149
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

742
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,483
Just take a look at those.

743
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,113
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

744
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:16,985
And, uh...

745
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:22,415
Here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

746
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,956
Mm, it's rather good.

747
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:27,249
What's up, Roger?

748
01:05:27,340 --> 01:05:30,207
The goons would have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

749
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:34,465
That's sorren's department. Now, I've
started working on the other materials.

750
01:05:34,556 --> 01:05:36,717
This, uh - this blanket.

751
01:05:36,808 --> 01:05:39,094
Particularly the stripes. Marvelous.

752
01:05:39,894 --> 01:05:41,304
- Coats.
- Yes.

753
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:43,978
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

754
01:05:44,065 --> 01:05:47,307
Oh, those battle dresses -
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

755
01:05:47,402 --> 01:05:50,769
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

756
01:05:50,864 --> 01:05:52,274
Mm-hmm.

757
01:05:52,365 --> 01:05:53,730
Blanket ticking.

758
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:59,036
Now, I've made these
into rather nice little waistcoats.

759
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:00,862
Ah, very dapper, yes.

760
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:02,822
- Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

761
01:06:02,917 --> 01:06:04,908
Uh, just take a look at this, Roger.

762
01:06:05,879 --> 01:06:07,710
Now, this blanket material,

763
01:06:07,797 --> 01:06:11,039
we scrape this down
until it's really smooth

764
01:06:11,134 --> 01:06:12,874
and then dye it with boot Polish.

765
01:06:13,470 --> 01:06:17,429
Corduroy scrounged by hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

766
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:20,473
- Where in god's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

767
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:22,972
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

768
01:06:23,062 --> 01:06:25,474
What did he say? "Don't ask."

769
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:28,557
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.

770
01:06:58,223 --> 01:06:59,633
- Hilts.
- Good morning, hilts.

771
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:01,089
Uh-oh.

772
01:07:02,477 --> 01:07:05,640
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

773
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:07,846
- When?
- Seventeen days. Seventh of July.

774
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,772
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

775
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,440
Is ives going with you?

776
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:13,814
Yeah, if he wants to.

777
01:07:15,490 --> 01:07:18,527
You, uh - you know that ives
is close to cracking.

778
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:20,866
Yeah.

779
01:07:22,956 --> 01:07:25,100
Figure it's better for him
to go out in the tunnel, huh?

780
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:26,284
Safer.

781
01:07:32,215 --> 01:07:33,250
Right.

782
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:39,503
Hilts, it's possible for one man to
get out through the wire, even get away,

783
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:41,963
but, um, there are in fact

784
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:45,516
a considerable number of people
besides yourself in this camp

785
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,218
who are trying to escape.

786
01:07:48,481 --> 01:07:50,221
I appreciate that.

787
01:07:53,069 --> 01:07:54,980
Something's coming, I can feel it,

788
01:07:55,071 --> 01:07:57,608
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, squadron leader.

789
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:00,941
- Uh, my name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

790
01:08:01,035 --> 01:08:03,401
Yours is, uh, Virgil, isn't it?

791
01:08:04,747 --> 01:08:07,238
Hilts. Just make it hilts.

792
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:12,911
Yes, well, um, as I was saying, hilts,

793
01:08:13,006 --> 01:08:17,045
um, we have maps of Germany -
general maps, that is.

794
01:08:17,135 --> 01:08:19,421
In fact,
we have all the information that we need

795
01:08:19,512 --> 01:08:21,298
for the escape routes out of Germany.

796
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:23,471
But, um, what we do not have -

797
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:27,142
is a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

798
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:30,186
Right. We've tried every goon
in the camp. No go.

799
01:08:30,273 --> 01:08:33,765
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

800
01:08:34,527 --> 01:08:37,189
We want to know where we hit
the main roads. They must patrol them.

801
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:40,613
Where the police stations are, where
they've got their military roadblocks.

802
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,531
And most important of all,

803
01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:46,328
we've got to know how to get from here
to the railway station.

804
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:50,453
No. Absolutely not.

805
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,229
When I get through that wire,
I'm not gonna be

806
01:08:52,253 --> 01:08:54,414
peeking over fences,
making maps for you guys.

807
01:08:54,505 --> 01:08:56,245
By morning I'm gonna be so far away,

808
01:08:56,341 --> 01:08:58,781
you couldn't hear it
if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

809
01:08:58,843 --> 01:09:01,209
- Hmm?
- That's understandable.

810
01:09:02,055 --> 01:09:03,215
Completely.

811
01:09:05,433 --> 01:09:07,424
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

812
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:12,808
Interesting idea.

813
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,390
How many you taking out?

814
01:09:15,485 --> 01:09:16,975
Two hundred and fifty.

815
01:09:19,822 --> 01:09:22,188
Two hundred and fifty?

816
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:23,398
Yeah.

817
01:09:24,619 --> 01:09:26,780
You're crazy.
You oughta be locked up. You too.

818
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:30,238
Two hundred and fifty guys just
walking down the road, just like that.

819
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:34,121
Well, some on the road,
some by train, some cross-country.

820
01:09:34,212 --> 01:09:36,624
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

821
01:09:36,714 --> 01:09:38,579
maps, compasses, rations.

822
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:41,917
Has it occurred to you that you're gonna
alert every goon in the country?

823
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,878
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

824
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:48,806
They're gonna swoop down and scoop
you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

825
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,686
Yes, well, uh, thanks anyway.

826
01:09:54,774 --> 01:09:57,140
Anything I can do to help on the tunnel,
let me know.

827
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,317
- That's very good of you.
- Anytime.

828
01:10:01,447 --> 01:10:03,438
Wait a minute!

829
01:10:03,533 --> 01:10:07,025
You aren't seriously suggesting
that if I get through the wire

830
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,032
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

831
01:10:10,123 --> 01:10:13,035
to turn myself in and get thrown back
in the cooler for a couple months

832
01:10:13,126 --> 01:10:15,458
so you can get the information you need?

833
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,035
Yes.

834
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:20,247
One has to ask some very strange things
in the job I have.

835
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,081
We'll give you a front place
in the tunnel.

836
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:24,446
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.
- I don't blame you.

837
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,052
- Well, okay, then.
- Well, it's completely understandable.

838
01:10:27,140 --> 01:10:28,346
Well, okay, then.

839
01:10:31,102 --> 01:10:32,592
Yes, well, thanks, hilts.

840
01:10:40,570 --> 01:10:41,730
Check.

841
01:10:45,450 --> 01:10:47,031
Herr hendley, I...

842
01:10:47,118 --> 01:10:49,279
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

843
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,121
What's the matter, Werner?

844
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:57,666
My wallet, my papers,
my identity card, gone.

845
01:10:57,754 --> 01:10:59,619
I lost them. Everything.

846
01:11:00,882 --> 01:11:02,838
He lost his wallet. Hmm?

847
01:11:02,925 --> 01:11:05,917
Do you realize what would happen
if strachwitz found this out?

848
01:11:06,012 --> 01:11:08,344
- Zzzt! The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

849
01:11:11,350 --> 01:11:13,215
I've looked everyplace, everyplace.

850
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:18,013
I must have lost them while I was in here.

851
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:20,272
No. Yes.

852
01:11:21,527 --> 01:11:24,439
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

853
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:27,275
Oh, thank you, herr hendley.

854
01:11:29,076 --> 01:11:30,236
Werner.

855
01:11:30,995 --> 01:11:32,531
Not now.

856
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,203
It might look a little peculiar

857
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,997
if you and I were seen
probing around at this time of night.

858
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:38,084
On.

859
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:40,660
Look, I'll find them.

860
01:11:40,755 --> 01:11:43,747
I promise you I'll find 'em
if I have to tear this room apart.

861
01:11:50,765 --> 01:11:52,301
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

862
01:11:53,476 --> 01:11:55,091
Werner... yes?

863
01:11:55,186 --> 01:11:57,051
- There is one small favor.
- Ja?

864
01:11:57,146 --> 01:11:58,386
A camera.

865
01:12:01,484 --> 01:12:04,726
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

866
01:12:06,197 --> 01:12:10,065
35-millimeter with a 2.8 lens
and a plane shutter.

867
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:11,740
Focal-plane shutter.

868
01:12:14,539 --> 01:12:17,326
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

869
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,575
Let me know when you got it.

870
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:29,296
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid, that Werner,
but I like him.

871
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:31,669
Checkmate.

872
01:12:56,539 --> 01:12:58,621
How soon is our air pump
going to be ready?

873
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:02,166
- Oh, I'll have it for you tomorrow, Roger.
- You're badly behind schedule.

874
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:04,710
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

875
01:13:04,797 --> 01:13:07,038
- No good?
- Today, three times -

876
01:13:25,067 --> 01:13:26,432
Willie, you all right?

877
01:13:26,527 --> 01:13:27,562
Pull!

878
01:13:57,099 --> 01:13:59,636
You're gonna have to shore up
the whole bloody tunnel, Roger.

879
01:13:59,727 --> 01:14:01,592
All 335 feet of it.

880
01:14:02,355 --> 01:14:04,892
Four times today.

881
01:14:04,982 --> 01:14:09,146
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

882
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:13,313
It's a lot of timber, Roger.
Can you get it?

883
01:14:16,535 --> 01:14:17,650
We'll get it.

884
01:14:18,621 --> 01:14:19,861
We've gotta get it.

885
01:14:20,706 --> 01:14:23,573
I'll put hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

886
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:26,951
Okay, Willie.

887
01:14:27,046 --> 01:14:30,504

910
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:57,796
- Say, cavendish -

912
01:16:08,272 --> 01:16:09,557
Never mind.

913
01:16:20,201 --> 01:16:22,283
Here's a present from our friend, Werner.

914
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,696
Splendid. Simply splendid.

915
01:16:28,042 --> 01:16:30,374
This should do very nicely.

916
01:16:33,631 --> 01:16:35,542
Those are Ashley-pitt's men.

917
01:16:35,633 --> 01:16:39,125
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

918
01:17:43,868 --> 01:17:44,948
Hmm.

919
01:17:47,955 --> 01:17:52,244
Tom has reached just beyond that, uh,
pile of wood, sir, in the vorlager.

920
01:17:52,334 --> 01:17:54,666
Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.

921
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:56,664
How much further to the trees?

922
01:17:56,755 --> 01:17:58,791
We make it 50 feet, sir.

923
01:17:58,883 --> 01:18:01,169
- Dark of the moon is the seventh -
- Eighth and ninth.

924
01:18:01,260 --> 01:18:03,751
- Eighth and ninth. Mm.
- A day earlier in August.

925
01:18:03,846 --> 01:18:04,846
Yes.

926
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:11,849
Morning.

927
01:18:13,189 --> 01:18:14,770
There he goes again.

928
01:18:15,608 --> 01:18:18,065
Why is he buying up
all the potatoes in the camp?

929
01:18:18,152 --> 01:18:21,019
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

930
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:23,775
Hilts and hendley lock themselves
in their room every night.

931
01:18:23,866 --> 01:18:27,233
Sometimes goff's in there with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

932
01:18:27,328 --> 01:18:31,287
Mac, we'll close down dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

933
01:18:31,373 --> 01:18:34,456
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press right on into the trees.

934
01:18:34,543 --> 01:18:35,703
Right, Roger.

935
01:19:23,884 --> 01:19:24,884
Wow.

936
01:19:27,346 --> 01:19:28,346
Wow.

937
01:19:29,348 --> 01:19:31,714
Wow.

938
01:19:59,003 --> 01:20:00,118
Wow.

939
01:20:07,261 --> 01:20:08,376
Wow.

940
01:20:16,603 --> 01:20:18,343
Wow.

941
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:10,855
About face!

942
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:13,565
Forward march!

943
01:21:21,043 --> 01:21:22,453
What is it?

944
01:21:22,544 --> 01:21:24,330
They're celebrating the revolution.

945
01:21:25,130 --> 01:21:26,870
It's the fourth of July.

946
01:21:36,392 --> 01:21:38,007
What the devil is this?

947
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:43,186
And halt!

948
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,561
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks
at the wash tank.

949
01:21:46,652 --> 01:21:48,922
It's the fourth of July.
A little present from the colonials.

950
01:21:48,946 --> 01:21:50,436
- Down the British.
- Hear, hear.

951
01:21:50,531 --> 01:21:52,897
- Quite right too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

952
01:21:52,991 --> 01:21:55,232
- And to getting home.
- Thank you.

953
01:21:55,327 --> 01:21:56,908
Very well. We accept.

954
01:21:56,995 --> 01:21:58,860
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

955
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:02,414
Gentlemen, if you'd care to follow us.
About face!

956
01:22:02,501 --> 01:22:04,037
Column, now! March!

957
01:22:21,854 --> 01:22:24,266
- Company, halt!
- Fall out!

958
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:30,150
All right, let's line up down here!

959
01:22:31,572 --> 01:22:33,108
All right, grab a cup!

960
01:22:34,116 --> 01:22:36,323
Line it up! Here we go.

961
01:22:36,410 --> 01:22:39,277
All right, keep it moving.
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

962
01:22:43,292 --> 01:22:45,908
That explains
what happened to the potatoes.

963
01:22:46,003 --> 01:22:48,836
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

964
01:22:48,922 --> 01:22:51,834
No, I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

965
01:22:51,925 --> 01:22:53,540
There's only 14 feet to go, sir,

966
01:22:53,635 --> 01:22:55,751
and you can feel it
throughout the whole bloody camp.

967
01:22:55,846 --> 01:22:58,713
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear, sir.

968
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:01,298
- Drink it up.
- What is this stuff, hilts?

969
01:23:01,393 --> 01:23:04,510
Moonshine. American moonshine. Moonshine.

970
01:23:04,605 --> 01:23:08,723
- Make my mustache grow. Cheers.
- Here we go. Keep it moving, now.

971
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:12,184
Keep it go -
hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.

972
01:23:12,279 --> 01:23:14,440
- There you go.
- Hello, Eric. Down with the British.

973
01:23:14,531 --> 01:23:17,898
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo - whoop!

974
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:20,234
Yeah. Don't get any on your clothes.

975
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:22,615
- Cheers!
- Don't get any on your clothes.

976
01:23:22,706 --> 01:23:25,448
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

977
01:23:25,542 --> 01:23:28,124
- Have you any tonic water?
- Here, keep it moving.

978
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:30,419
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

979
01:23:30,506 --> 01:23:33,293
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

980
01:23:34,301 --> 01:23:36,963
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

981
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,014
Cheerio!

982
01:23:51,985 --> 01:23:53,941
Get good and stoned, my friend.

983
01:23:56,490 --> 01:23:58,606
Keep it going. Keep it...

984
01:23:59,660 --> 01:24:02,367
No taxation without representation.

985
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,120
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

986
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:11,994
Well, let's drink to Tom.

987
01:24:12,089 --> 01:24:13,124
To Tom.

988
01:24:17,678 --> 01:24:19,760
Oi!

989
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,504
In the three years, seven months

990
01:24:22,599 --> 01:24:25,386
and approximately two weeks
that I've been in the bag,

991
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:27,843
that's the most extraordinary stuff
I've ever tasted.

992
01:24:28,522 --> 01:24:30,478
Oh, it's shattering!

993
01:24:30,566 --> 01:24:32,557
Well, I think it's rather good.

994
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:38,320
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll "all on kive" -

995
01:24:38,407 --> 01:24:40,898
call on ives.

996
01:24:51,003 --> 01:24:52,709
- Cheers, hendley!
- Hendley!

997
01:24:52,796 --> 01:24:53,911
Cheers!

998
01:25:01,471 --> 01:25:02,927
You know what that is?

999
01:25:03,473 --> 01:25:05,088
I'll tell you what it isn't.

1000
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:07,720
It isn't Napoleon Brandy.

1001
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:11,428
How do you like it, sir?

1002
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:14,690
Well, it's, um...

1003
01:25:14,776 --> 01:25:16,607
To the colonies.

1004
01:25:16,695 --> 01:25:18,231
Independence.

1005
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:26,902
How are you managing over there
without us?

1006
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:28,533
Getting along all right, are you?

1007
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:31,536
We seem to be getting along all right,
shir - sir.

1008
01:25:40,135 --> 01:25:41,671
Yes, well, it's, uh...

1009
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,511
It's good stuff, hilts.

1010
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,508
Thank you, sir.

1011
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,280
Danny? Here's to...

1012
01:26:19,800 --> 01:26:22,291
Roger, goons in 105.

1013
01:26:23,220 --> 01:26:25,006
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

1014
01:26:28,308 --> 01:26:32,301
We have to ignore it. If we pay attention,
the goons will know the hut's important.

1015
01:26:34,439 --> 01:26:35,929
Here's to going home.

1016
01:26:51,164 --> 01:26:54,622
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

1017
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:55,950
Home.

1018
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:11,494
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us, piglet.

1019
01:27:11,518 --> 01:27:13,224
- Aye.
- To Tom, eh?

1020
01:27:15,856 --> 01:27:19,940
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down
argyle street in a couple of weeks, man.

1021
01:27:20,026 --> 01:27:21,607
To Tom.

1022
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:24,778
You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realize that myself.

1023
01:27:24,865 --> 01:27:27,902
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

1024
01:27:27,993 --> 01:27:29,949
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

1025
01:28:17,334 --> 01:28:19,074
Herr hauptfelawebel! Herr hauplfeldwebel!

1026
01:28:19,961 --> 01:28:21,041
Herr hauptfeldwebel!

1027
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,291
Oh, my god, they've found Tom!

1028
01:29:16,226 --> 01:29:17,557
It's the tunnel.

1029
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:36,943
Success.

1030
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,015
- Ives!
- Halt!

1031
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,347
- Ives! Ves!
- Halt! Halt!

1032
01:30:05,442 --> 01:30:06,442
Halt!

1033
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:14,750
Sir...

1034
01:31:15,887 --> 01:31:17,923
Let me know
the exact information you need.

1035
01:31:18,848 --> 01:31:20,930
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

1036
01:31:23,603 --> 01:31:25,059
Open up Harry.

1037
01:31:25,730 --> 01:31:28,267
We dig. Around the clock.

1038
01:33:06,414 --> 01:33:07,529
Cooler.

1039
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:09,201
Right.

1040
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:15,120
Well,
I didn't think they'd catch him so soon.

1041
01:33:16,800 --> 01:33:18,210
He wasn't caught.

1042
01:33:32,565 --> 01:33:34,476
Hilts, welcome home.

1043
01:34:27,704 --> 01:34:28,704
Danny?

1044
01:34:31,291 --> 01:34:32,326
Danny?

1045
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:37,039
Danny?

1046
01:34:44,596 --> 01:34:46,086
Are you all right, Danny?

1047
01:34:48,391 --> 01:34:49,391
Yes.

1048
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:51,595
All right.

1049
01:34:54,647 --> 01:34:57,434
All right.
Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

1050
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:02,936
For god's sake, smithy,
you've left out a whole bloody eagle.

1051
01:35:03,031 --> 01:35:04,396
That's impossible.

1052
01:35:08,745 --> 01:35:10,952
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

1053
01:35:12,790 --> 01:35:14,496
I'm sorry, Colin.

1054
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:16,746
It's all right, smithy.

1055
01:35:18,254 --> 01:35:19,790
It's getting late.

1056
01:35:19,881 --> 01:35:22,042
You push off to bed. I'll pack up here.

1057
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:23,293
Right.

1058
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:25,633
Good night, Colin.

1059
01:35:25,720 --> 01:35:26,960
Good night, smithy.

1060
01:36:07,220 --> 01:36:08,960
I can't see a bloody thing.

1061
01:36:26,447 --> 01:36:27,653
Hell Hitler.

1062
01:36:37,917 --> 01:36:40,829
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...

1063
01:36:41,462 --> 01:36:42,998
Oh, now, watch it, haynes.

1064
01:36:43,089 --> 01:36:46,297
That's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

1065
01:36:46,384 --> 01:36:48,591
- Sorry, Mac.
- Okay. But remember: German always.

1066
01:36:48,678 --> 01:36:50,214
- Right-o.
- All right?

1067
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:06,234
One, two, three, four, five.

1068
01:37:23,921 --> 01:37:26,583
Roger?

1069
01:37:31,721 --> 01:37:33,211
No, it's me.

1070
01:37:35,933 --> 01:37:38,015
How do you like the old escape suit?

1071
01:37:38,102 --> 01:37:39,467
Fine, fine.

1072
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:43,472
Colin...

1073
01:37:46,569 --> 01:37:48,150
How do you like mine?

1074
01:37:49,030 --> 01:37:50,520
It looks splendid.

1075
01:38:17,642 --> 01:38:20,099
Danny, where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

1076
01:38:20,186 --> 01:38:23,394
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

1077
01:38:25,900 --> 01:38:29,609
Danny, we're getting out
through the tunnel. We're almost clear.

1078
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,856
Please, Willie, let me alone.

1079
01:38:32,532 --> 01:38:34,648
I can't go in that tunnel anymore.

1080
01:38:35,368 --> 01:38:37,450
So I'm going out through the wire.

1081
01:38:41,374 --> 01:38:43,035
Danny, think.

1082
01:38:43,126 --> 01:38:45,242
We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

1083
01:38:45,336 --> 01:38:47,793
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

1084
01:38:48,423 --> 01:38:50,129
- I go out now.
- No.

1085
01:38:51,634 --> 01:38:54,626
Danny, you go through that wire,
and you'll get killed.

1086
01:39:02,353 --> 01:39:03,638
Don't do that.

1087
01:39:06,274 --> 01:39:07,434
Willie...

1088
01:39:10,153 --> 01:39:11,734
Since I was a boy,

1089
01:39:12,447 --> 01:39:16,941
I hated and feared little rooms,

1090
01:39:17,034 --> 01:39:19,150
closets, caves.

1091
01:39:19,245 --> 01:39:21,736
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.

1092
01:39:21,831 --> 01:39:23,867
Because I must get out.

1093
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:27,082
I hide the fear, and I dig.

1094
01:39:28,504 --> 01:39:31,962
But tomorrow night,
in the tunnel with all those men,

1095
01:39:32,717 --> 01:39:35,379
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head

1096
01:39:35,470 --> 01:39:37,506
and ruin the escape for everybody.

1097
01:39:40,933 --> 01:39:42,173
So I go now.

1098
01:39:47,690 --> 01:39:50,272
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.

1099
01:39:52,153 --> 01:39:54,895
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

1100
01:39:56,532 --> 01:39:57,738
All right.

1101
01:40:07,210 --> 01:40:09,246
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

1102
01:40:09,962 --> 01:40:12,624
Well, how do you think we look?

1103
01:40:16,219 --> 01:40:18,005
It's as bad as all that?

1104
01:40:18,095 --> 01:40:22,213
Colin, I - I want first of all to say
that without you,

1105
01:40:22,934 --> 01:40:24,674
we would not have been ready.

1106
01:40:24,769 --> 01:40:28,307
Oh, that's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.

1107
01:40:30,274 --> 01:40:31,810
What's the matter, Roger?

1108
01:40:33,194 --> 01:40:34,434
You can't go.

1109
01:40:36,072 --> 01:40:37,937
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.

1110
01:40:38,032 --> 01:40:39,032
Why?

1111
01:40:39,116 --> 01:40:42,199
Because you can't see your hand
in front of your face.

1112
01:40:42,286 --> 01:40:44,072
You'd be caught before you got ten yards.

1113
01:40:44,956 --> 01:40:46,412
That's ridiculous.

1114
01:40:48,000 --> 01:40:49,615
That's ridiculous.

1115
01:40:49,710 --> 01:40:52,918
Never heard anything so absurd in my life.
I can see perfectly.

1116
01:40:53,589 --> 01:40:55,079
I can see perfectly!

1117
01:40:55,716 --> 01:40:59,129
I can see... that pin down there.

1118
01:40:59,220 --> 01:41:01,302
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

1119
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:16,726
Colin, do you, uh,
see the foot of the door?

1120
01:41:18,114 --> 01:41:19,274
Yes, of course.

1121
01:41:21,576 --> 01:41:23,282
Put the pin down there, will you?

1122
01:41:24,829 --> 01:41:26,114
All right.

1123
01:41:30,876 --> 01:41:31,991
All right. Come on.

1124
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:34,702
Come on, sit down.

1125
01:41:36,757 --> 01:41:39,214
Sit down. It was a good try.

1126
01:41:40,803 --> 01:41:44,011
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

1127
01:41:44,682 --> 01:41:47,970
- It's too risky for you.
- Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

1128
01:41:48,603 --> 01:41:50,685
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

1129
01:41:50,771 --> 01:41:53,057
We all know the score here.

1130
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:56,312
Well, at least most of us do.

1131
01:41:56,402 --> 01:41:59,815
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

1132
01:41:59,905 --> 01:42:01,770
to foul up the Germans behind the lines.

1133
01:42:01,866 --> 01:42:04,073
All right, that's fine, that's fine.

1134
01:42:04,160 --> 01:42:06,822
But once we get past that barbed wire,
once we have them looking

1135
01:42:06,912 --> 01:42:08,868
all over Germany for us,

1136
01:42:08,956 --> 01:42:10,492
that mission is accomplished.

1137
01:42:11,208 --> 01:42:14,325
Afterwards, we have some ideas of our own.

1138
01:42:15,713 --> 01:42:17,578
You mean getting home?

1139
01:42:17,673 --> 01:42:19,914
- Back to your family and children?
- That's right.

1140
01:42:20,009 --> 01:42:23,501
Good god, man. Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that too?

1141
01:42:23,596 --> 01:42:25,086
I'm sure you have.

1142
01:42:26,807 --> 01:42:28,388
I know Colin has.

1143
01:42:29,852 --> 01:42:34,016
And, Roger, I have too.
We think we can make it all the way.

1144
01:42:34,106 --> 01:42:35,562
Not Colin.

1145
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:38,767
He'd be an appalling hazard to the escape.
That must be my decision.

1146
01:42:38,861 --> 01:42:42,353
You want to talk about hazard,
let's talk about you.

1147
01:42:43,324 --> 01:42:46,737
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The gestapo has you marked.

1148
01:42:48,996 --> 01:42:50,736
No one has said you can't go.

1149
01:42:52,708 --> 01:42:54,118
That's true.

1150
01:42:55,336 --> 01:42:57,327
And I have thought about the gestapo.

1151
01:42:59,757 --> 01:43:03,796
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go,

1152
01:43:03,886 --> 01:43:05,126
or dare go...

1153
01:43:06,806 --> 01:43:08,922
Or should be permitted to play god...

1154
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:12,216
I can't answer you.

1155
01:43:13,938 --> 01:43:15,553
But I can tell you,

1156
01:43:16,232 --> 01:43:20,020
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
not only to himself but the whole plan

1157
01:43:20,111 --> 01:43:22,818
and must therefore be eliminated
from the operation.

1158
01:43:34,208 --> 01:43:37,200
Colin's not a blind man
as long as he's with me,

1159
01:43:37,294 --> 01:43:39,034
and he's going with me.

1160
01:43:45,344 --> 01:43:47,084
It's all right with you, Colin?

1161
01:43:49,807 --> 01:43:52,389
Oh, yes. Quite.

1162
01:43:59,942 --> 01:44:01,148
Very well.

1163
01:44:01,986 --> 01:44:04,853
I'll arrange for your escape numbers
to be altered accordingly.

1164
01:44:06,615 --> 01:44:08,196
Good night, gentlemen.

1165
01:44:15,499 --> 01:44:16,739
Actually...

1166
01:44:18,586 --> 01:44:20,122
He's quite right.

1167
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,461
He's completely right.

1168
01:44:23,466 --> 01:44:25,548
I really shouldn't go at all.

1169
01:44:25,634 --> 01:44:29,092
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

1170
01:44:29,180 --> 01:44:31,887
I think they call it progressive myopia.

1171
01:44:33,309 --> 01:44:37,973
I can see things up here, close to.
I can see to work.

1172
01:44:38,063 --> 01:44:39,348
But, uh...

1173
01:44:41,609 --> 01:44:42,724
You're just a blur.

1174
01:44:44,153 --> 01:44:45,268
I know.

1175
01:44:47,031 --> 01:44:49,568
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.

1176
01:44:52,953 --> 01:44:55,319
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

1177
01:44:57,291 --> 01:44:58,622
Splendid.

1178
01:45:17,603 --> 01:45:18,603
Aus.

1179
01:45:44,880 --> 01:45:45,995
Hi, hilts.

1180
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:48,289
Hey, Mac.

1181
01:45:51,387 --> 01:45:52,387
When?

1182
01:45:53,138 --> 01:45:55,595
Tonight.
We thought they'd never let you out.

1183
01:45:55,683 --> 01:45:57,765
Me too. Let's get at it.

1184
01:45:58,394 --> 01:46:00,476
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

1185
01:47:12,259 --> 01:47:13,259
What time?

1186
01:47:15,930 --> 01:47:17,545
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1187
01:47:21,727 --> 01:47:22,727
You okay?

1188
01:47:34,156 --> 01:47:35,271
Cavendish.

1189
01:47:36,241 --> 01:47:39,199
Griff, down there. Goff, there.

1190
01:47:59,640 --> 01:48:02,382
Smith, foles, third on the right.

1191
01:48:03,602 --> 01:48:06,389
Blythe, hendley, third on the left.

1192
01:48:35,134 --> 01:48:37,591
There are the lights.

1193
01:48:39,013 --> 01:48:40,753
Right on the tick, Danny.

1194
01:48:51,400 --> 01:48:53,516
Look down the tunnel, Danny.

1195
01:48:53,610 --> 01:48:55,521
It's lovely.

1196
01:48:57,031 --> 01:49:00,194
It's just like blackpool
at the height of the season.

1197
01:49:02,202 --> 01:49:04,033
You ever been to blackpool, Danny?

1198
01:49:04,997 --> 01:49:05,997
Yes.

1199
01:49:06,999 --> 01:49:07,999
No.

1200
01:49:09,710 --> 01:49:10,916
I don't know.

1201
01:49:14,757 --> 01:49:15,757
It's time, Roger.

1202
01:49:29,438 --> 01:49:32,521
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-pitt.

1203
01:49:36,487 --> 01:49:37,727
It's all clear, sir.

1204
01:49:46,622 --> 01:49:48,328
We're all set, Roger.

1205
01:50:01,470 --> 01:50:02,505
Roger.

1206
01:50:03,263 --> 01:50:04,343
Good luck.

1207
01:50:36,004 --> 01:50:37,869
They're coming down the shaft now, Danny.

1208
01:50:38,715 --> 01:50:40,956
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

1209
01:50:48,183 --> 01:50:49,218
Willie...

1210
01:50:50,435 --> 01:50:53,302
I can't wait till it's over.
I must get out.

1211
01:50:54,064 --> 01:50:55,850
Danny! Danny! Danny!

1212
01:50:56,942 --> 01:50:58,182
Danny!

1213
01:51:25,554 --> 01:51:27,419
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?

1214
01:51:27,514 --> 01:51:29,004
I must - - Danny! Come here!

1215
01:51:29,683 --> 01:51:32,846
Roger? Roger, Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.

1216
01:51:32,936 --> 01:51:35,222
Danny, tell me what this is,
and tell me quickly!

1217
01:51:35,898 --> 01:51:40,062
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.

1218
01:51:40,152 --> 01:51:42,438
I was buried many times. I go when I want.

1219
01:51:42,529 --> 01:51:44,394
Let me out. Let me out.

1220
01:51:47,576 --> 01:51:48,816
Take him out, Willie.

1221
01:51:48,911 --> 01:51:50,321
Roger - - take him out.

1222
01:52:04,927 --> 01:52:06,463
Danny? What is it?

1223
01:52:07,429 --> 01:52:09,590
Danny, what's going on?

1224
01:52:09,681 --> 01:52:12,764
It's all right, Sedgwick. It's all right.
We're going later.

1225
01:52:19,524 --> 01:52:22,061
Danny - Danny, it's all right.
It's all right.

1226
01:52:22,152 --> 01:52:25,394
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.

1227
01:52:26,949 --> 01:52:28,735
All right, Colin. Down you go.

1228
01:52:29,618 --> 01:52:32,735
Sit down. Feel the top rung of the ladder
with your right foot.

1229
01:52:32,829 --> 01:52:34,319
Got it? Huh?

1230
01:52:34,414 --> 01:52:35,574
Down you go.

1231
01:52:51,598 --> 01:52:53,054
Danny cut out, huh?

1232
01:52:53,809 --> 01:52:56,516
Willie took him up top. Hilts, I, uh...

1233
01:53:09,366 --> 01:53:12,028
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

1234
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:30,584
Right.

1235
01:53:37,519 --> 01:53:39,055
Psst! Bartlett!

1236
01:53:42,024 --> 01:53:43,024
Ohl

1237
01:54:18,310 --> 01:54:19,425
All right?

1238
01:54:20,645 --> 01:54:22,977
Hold on to yourself, bartlett.
You're 20 feet short.

1239
01:54:23,065 --> 01:54:26,102
What do you mean, 20 feet short?
You're 20 feet short of the woods.

1240
01:54:26,193 --> 01:54:29,902
The hole is in right here in the open.
The guard is between us and the lights.

1241
01:54:29,988 --> 01:54:32,070
How could that happen? The survey -

1242
01:54:32,157 --> 01:54:34,398
what the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.

1243
01:54:49,549 --> 01:54:51,790
- Roger -
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!

1244
01:54:53,345 --> 01:54:55,336
We could postpone it
till we dig to the trees.

1245
01:54:55,430 --> 01:54:57,967
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

1246
01:55:02,771 --> 01:55:04,602
One chance.

1247
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:07,852
When the guard goes to the far end,
you might be able to move your men out.

1248
01:55:07,943 --> 01:55:11,527
I think I can make it to the woods,
set up a signal when you're clear.

1249
01:55:11,613 --> 01:55:14,320
- What about the goon towers?
- A chance you're gonna have to take.

1250
01:55:20,914 --> 01:55:23,200
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1251
01:55:24,292 --> 01:55:26,328
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1252
01:55:27,754 --> 01:55:30,086
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1253
01:55:32,217 --> 01:55:33,832
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1254
01:55:33,927 --> 01:55:35,838
- What?
- Thirty feet of rope!

1255
01:55:35,929 --> 01:55:38,841
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

1256
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:56,275
How's it going, Tommy? Have you heard?

1257
01:55:56,366 --> 01:55:58,357
Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

1258
01:55:59,119 --> 01:56:02,111
- Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
- I don't think so, sir.

1259
01:56:25,687 --> 01:56:27,052
He's over there.

1260
01:56:33,612 --> 01:56:35,853
Right. You go first, Eric.

1261
01:56:36,865 --> 01:56:39,026
- I'm staying here till we get moving.
- Right.

1262
01:56:50,378 --> 01:56:52,790
- See you in piccadilly.
- Scott's bar.

1263
01:56:52,881 --> 01:56:54,212
Right.

1264
01:57:07,312 --> 01:57:09,303
Thank you. Good luck.

1265
01:57:09,397 --> 01:57:10,397
Right.

1266
01:57:35,674 --> 01:57:36,880
We're moving.

1267
01:57:43,848 --> 01:57:47,306
Danny, they're moving through
the tunnel now. They're getting out.

1268
01:57:51,022 --> 01:57:53,229
Danny, when Warsaw fell,

1269
01:57:53,316 --> 01:57:55,932
you escaped and came to england
because you're a flier.

1270
01:57:56,611 --> 01:57:59,853
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

1271
01:58:01,032 --> 01:58:04,115
We can get out now.
We can get back to england.

1272
01:58:05,996 --> 01:58:08,282
Danny,
if you don't go through that tunnel,

1273
01:58:08,373 --> 01:58:10,534
everything you've done
will have been for nothing.

1274
01:58:10,625 --> 01:58:11,785
Nothing!

1275
01:58:40,697 --> 01:58:42,562
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

1276
01:58:45,243 --> 01:58:47,029
In here, Colin. Come on.

1277
01:58:47,746 --> 01:58:48,861
Sit down.

1278
01:58:54,502 --> 01:58:56,367
You're up, Sedgwick. I'll take over.

1279
01:59:00,467 --> 01:59:03,709
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.

1280
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:05,964
Sedgwick,
you won't get this thing through.

1281
01:59:06,056 --> 01:59:07,091
I'll cope.

1282
01:59:10,352 --> 01:59:12,684
Was that Sedgwick with his steamer trunk?

1283
01:59:12,771 --> 01:59:15,478
- Who else?
- I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1284
01:59:22,656 --> 01:59:24,442
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell -

1285
01:59:24,532 --> 01:59:28,366
we're 20 feet short. Hilts is on
the other end of that rope in the woods.

1286
01:59:28,453 --> 01:59:30,373
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,
off you go,

1287
01:59:30,455 --> 01:59:32,946
- but keep Colin low on the way across.
- Right.

1288
01:59:34,334 --> 01:59:35,949
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1289
01:59:46,012 --> 01:59:47,012
What's that?

1290
01:59:49,099 --> 01:59:52,057
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, god, no!

1291
01:59:52,143 --> 01:59:55,431
The goons'll pull the switches,
and we'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

1292
01:59:55,522 --> 01:59:58,685
Come on, Colin. We can get out
when the lights go down.

1293
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:12,579
Willie.

1294
02:00:13,498 --> 02:00:14,498
Willie!

1295
02:00:16,835 --> 02:00:19,076
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!

1296
02:00:26,136 --> 02:00:27,342
Get 'em out.

1297
02:00:33,435 --> 02:00:35,517
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.

1298
02:00:35,603 --> 02:00:37,844
- It's gonna cave!
- Danny. Danny, it's all right.

1299
02:00:37,939 --> 02:00:39,645
Danny, there's the lights.

1300
02:00:40,859 --> 02:00:43,396
Light the fat lamps down there!

1301
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:47,445
There's been an air raid,
and they've cut the lights, Danny.

1302
02:00:47,532 --> 02:00:50,490
Danny, the tunnel, it's all right.
Listen to me!

1303
02:00:51,953 --> 02:00:53,784
Danny, look. Here.

1304
02:00:56,958 --> 02:01:01,577
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.

1305
02:01:09,012 --> 02:01:10,548
What the hell's going on?

1306
02:01:10,638 --> 02:01:12,003
You go.

1307
02:01:12,807 --> 02:01:15,514
No, Danny - Danny -

1308
02:01:15,602 --> 02:01:17,012
go.

1309
02:01:24,944 --> 02:01:27,230
- What is this, Willie?
- I brought Danny there.

1310
02:01:27,322 --> 02:01:29,529
- Is he stuck in there?
- No, he's all right.

1311
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:31,356
Get him out fast.

1312
02:01:33,745 --> 02:01:35,155
Psst! Come on!

1313
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:39,956
Come on, Danny, move.

1314
02:01:56,810 --> 02:01:57,925
Up you go.

1315
02:02:04,651 --> 02:02:06,061
Give me your bag.

1316
02:02:12,992 --> 02:02:14,528
We're on the rope!

1317
02:03:00,248 --> 02:03:04,241
You and I had better get out, or we won't
have a chance of any of the trains.

1318
02:03:04,335 --> 02:03:07,202
It's moving. We'll just have to pass
the instructions from man to man.

1319
02:03:09,340 --> 02:03:10,921
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

1320
02:03:57,680 --> 02:03:59,921
Come on, come on.

1321
02:04:18,910 --> 02:04:19,910
Come on.

1322
02:04:38,680 --> 02:04:40,045
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

1323
02:04:41,599 --> 02:04:42,839
Don't shoot!

1324
02:04:42,934 --> 02:04:44,344
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1325
02:04:44,435 --> 02:04:46,892
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

1326
02:04:49,816 --> 02:04:51,727
Get off! We're coming back!

1327
02:05:15,174 --> 02:05:18,462
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot
of shooting going on up there.

1328
02:05:18,553 --> 02:05:20,794
Think they've been shooting them
as they came out?

1329
02:05:20,888 --> 02:05:23,174
No, couldn't be.
We would've heard the shots before.

1330
02:05:26,269 --> 02:05:27,384
Pull!

1331
02:05:27,478 --> 02:05:29,594
- Wait for me.
- Away!

1332
02:05:34,819 --> 02:05:35,854
Out.

1333
02:05:57,633 --> 02:05:58,633
Out.

1334
02:06:33,169 --> 02:06:35,501
- How many did he say?
- Seventy-six.

1335
02:06:35,588 --> 02:06:36,919
Seventy-six.

1336
02:06:37,006 --> 02:06:38,462
- Seventy-six.
- Seventy-six.

1337
02:06:51,646 --> 02:06:53,307
Dismissed.

1338
02:06:53,898 --> 02:06:55,308
A-ten hut!

1339
02:07:52,039 --> 02:07:55,281
Half the guys who missed their trains
are piled up in this station.

1340
02:07:55,376 --> 02:07:58,584
Ashley-pitt, Roger, MacDonald, nimmo.

1341
02:07:58,671 --> 02:08:00,536
Makes quite a group.

1342
02:08:00,631 --> 02:08:01,916
What do we do?

1343
02:08:02,758 --> 02:08:04,089
Wait for the train.

1344
02:12:12,883 --> 02:12:14,089
Danke schon.

1345
02:14:09,166 --> 02:14:10,326
Tally-ho.

1346
02:14:44,910 --> 02:14:46,525
- Merci.
- Merci bien.

1347
02:14:54,086 --> 02:14:55,292
Tally-ho.

1348
02:15:15,608 --> 02:15:17,439
- Danke.
- Danke.

1349
02:15:28,746 --> 02:15:30,202
Are the police on the train?

1350
02:15:30,289 --> 02:15:32,701
Yes. The gestapo are with them.
We're gonna jump.

1351
02:15:32,791 --> 02:15:33,951
All right.

1352
02:15:39,548 --> 02:15:40,788
I'll tell you when.

1353
02:15:40,883 --> 02:15:43,625
I'd prefer you just to give me
a good, firm push.

1354
02:16:03,072 --> 02:16:05,529
Are you all right?
Yes. I'm fine.

1355
02:16:06,325 --> 02:16:08,031
That was quite exciting.

1356
02:16:09,912 --> 02:16:11,118
It isn't stopping.

1357
02:16:12,039 --> 02:16:13,575
No, we're all right.

1358
02:17:08,971 --> 02:17:10,256
Switzerland.

1359
02:17:43,922 --> 02:17:46,004
Hey!

1360
02:17:59,521 --> 02:18:01,557
Hey! Halt! Halt!

1361
02:21:53,171 --> 02:21:54,171
Bartlett.

1362
02:22:53,732 --> 02:22:55,597
Where were you going, cavendish?

1363
02:22:55,692 --> 02:22:58,604
L, uh - I hadn't quite decided.

1364
02:22:58,695 --> 02:23:01,562
What information were you to collect
on the way?

1365
02:23:01,656 --> 02:23:02,656
None.

1366
02:23:02,741 --> 02:23:05,178
What sabotage directions did you receive?

1367
02:23:05,202 --> 02:23:07,534
What have you done with your papers?

1368
02:23:09,414 --> 02:23:12,906
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.

1369
02:23:13,001 --> 02:23:16,118
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

1370
02:23:16,213 --> 02:23:18,545
All I did was to escape
from a prison camp.

1371
02:23:18,632 --> 02:23:21,499
You'd do the same
if you'd been locked up for three years.

1372
02:23:22,302 --> 02:23:23,542
I wanted to get home.

1373
02:23:23,637 --> 02:23:26,754
I don't think you'll ever see
your wife and children again.

1374
02:23:26,848 --> 02:23:29,180
You've obviously got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

1375
02:23:29,267 --> 02:23:31,053
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1376
02:23:32,938 --> 02:23:35,896
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.

1377
02:23:36,566 --> 02:23:40,479
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.

1378
02:23:42,114 --> 02:23:44,696
I dyed it with some boot Polish
to cover some oil smears

1379
02:23:44,783 --> 02:23:46,774
I picked up when I was shot down.

1380
02:23:57,838 --> 02:24:00,170
And you lost your insignia over the years?

1381
02:24:00,841 --> 02:24:02,001
That's right.

1382
02:24:07,931 --> 02:24:09,922
- Look -
- That's all, cavendish.

1383
02:24:35,041 --> 02:24:36,326
Hello, boys.

1384
02:24:41,006 --> 02:24:42,291
Hello, David.

1385
02:24:45,260 --> 02:24:47,251
- Hello, haynes.
- Hello, cavendish.

1386
02:24:49,055 --> 02:24:51,671
I wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

1387
02:24:51,766 --> 02:24:53,222
Just picked up?

1388
02:24:53,310 --> 02:24:55,050
Yes, this morning.

1389
02:25:11,953 --> 02:25:14,569
There's a trainer out there I can fly.

1390
02:25:14,664 --> 02:25:17,121
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1391
02:26:25,360 --> 02:26:26,360
Colin...

1392
02:26:27,570 --> 02:26:29,936
When I say go, crank this clockwise.

1393
02:26:30,740 --> 02:26:34,073
When the engine catches, don't move,
or you'll get a mouthful of propeller.

1394
02:26:48,591 --> 02:26:49,591
Go.

1395
02:27:40,352 --> 02:27:42,058
Next stop, Switzerland!

1396
02:29:04,853 --> 02:29:05,933
The alps.

1397
02:29:06,896 --> 02:29:07,896
Splendid.

1398
02:29:20,034 --> 02:29:23,322
Over this range, then 20 more minutes
and we've got it made.

1399
02:29:51,232 --> 02:29:52,688
What is it? Petrol?

1400
02:29:52,775 --> 02:29:55,437
I don't know. Fuel pump, carburetor.
We're losing power.

1401
02:30:20,720 --> 02:30:22,460
Go that way! I'll follow!

1402
02:30:47,372 --> 02:30:48,487
Hendley?

1403
02:30:53,628 --> 02:30:54,708
Colin?

1404
02:30:59,467 --> 02:31:01,924
Stop! Don't shoot! Please, don't -

1405
02:31:05,974 --> 02:31:06,974
Colin?

1406
02:31:08,476 --> 02:31:10,012
I'm sorry I fouled things up.

1407
02:31:11,688 --> 02:31:13,053
That's all right.

1408
02:31:14,524 --> 02:31:16,105
Thank you for...

1409
02:31:17,485 --> 02:31:20,147
Getting me... out.

1410
02:34:22,837 --> 02:34:24,168
Café suzette.

1411
02:34:26,048 --> 02:34:27,083
Oul

1412
02:34:39,270 --> 02:34:41,010
Bon appeéftit, monsieur. Merci.

1413
02:34:44,358 --> 02:34:47,691
Uh, monsieur? Uh, telephone pour vous.

1414
02:34:48,738 --> 02:34:50,899
- Telephone pour moi?
- Oui, monsieur. Telephone.

1415
02:34:55,495 --> 02:34:56,575
Merci

1416
02:34:58,247 --> 02:34:59,407
hello?

1417
02:35:00,750 --> 02:35:01,830
Hello?

1418
02:35:39,914 --> 02:35:41,120
Résistance.

1419
02:35:41,624 --> 02:35:42,909
Résistance?

1420
02:35:43,543 --> 02:35:45,158
Uh, you are english?

1421
02:35:45,962 --> 02:35:47,543
Uh, I'm Australian.

1422
02:35:48,381 --> 02:35:51,248
You can speak english. I understand.

1423
02:35:51,342 --> 02:35:52,673
Bloody good.

1424
02:35:53,427 --> 02:35:57,796
I'm a British officer. I've just escaped
from a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1425
02:35:57,890 --> 02:36:01,178
I'm trying to make my way into Spain now.
You understand me?

1426
02:36:01,269 --> 02:36:03,225
- Oui.
- Can you help me, now?

1427
02:36:05,398 --> 02:36:06,513
Huh?

1428
02:36:07,358 --> 02:36:09,314
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1429
02:36:32,675 --> 02:36:34,131
Jawohl

1430
02:36:50,651 --> 02:36:52,141
Au revoir, monsieur. Au revoir.

1431
02:36:52,236 --> 02:36:54,852
Au revoir good luck.

1432
02:36:55,698 --> 02:36:56,983
Thank you.

1433
02:38:02,515 --> 02:38:04,301
Halt! Halt!

1434
02:38:49,228 --> 02:38:51,389
You are english.

1435
02:39:33,522 --> 02:39:34,932
Herr bartlett?

1436
02:39:42,907 --> 02:39:44,568
Your German is good.

1437
02:39:45,493 --> 02:39:47,484
And I hear also your French.

1438
02:39:49,538 --> 02:39:52,325
Your arms... up!

1439
02:40:21,570 --> 02:40:22,730
Ah!

1440
02:40:28,702 --> 02:40:30,784
Herr bartlett.

1441
02:40:31,413 --> 02:40:33,529
And herr MacDonald.

1442
02:40:36,460 --> 02:40:38,451
Oh, we are together again.

1443
02:40:39,380 --> 02:40:42,872
You are going to wish
you had never put us to so much trouble.

1444
02:40:59,150 --> 02:41:00,936
What's troubling you, Roger?

1445
02:41:01,026 --> 02:41:02,982
I'm just a little surprised.

1446
02:41:03,070 --> 02:41:06,608
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

1447
02:41:06,699 --> 02:41:07,779
Yes.

1448
02:41:08,659 --> 02:41:11,366
I have to admit, I -
I'm a little worried, though.

1449
02:41:11,453 --> 02:41:14,115
I hope to god I haven't blotted
70-odd ledgers.

1450
02:41:14,206 --> 02:41:16,288
Och, no, no.

1451
02:41:16,375 --> 02:41:19,959
We're all over 21,
footloose and fancy-free.

1452
02:41:20,045 --> 02:41:23,128
We'd never have got as far as we did
without you, Roger.

1453
02:41:23,215 --> 02:41:26,753
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

1454
02:41:26,844 --> 02:41:29,802
- I think we all do.
- Yes.

1455
02:42:09,970 --> 02:42:13,554
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

1456
02:42:13,641 --> 02:42:16,383
It will take hours
before you reach the camp.

1457
02:42:38,332 --> 02:42:40,118
You know, Mac, all this -

1458
02:42:40,209 --> 02:42:43,952
the organization, tunneling,
Tom and Harry -

1459
02:42:44,046 --> 02:42:45,331
kept me alive.

1460
02:42:46,590 --> 02:42:48,205
And even though we...

1461
02:42:50,219 --> 02:42:51,800
I've never been happier.

1462
02:42:53,264 --> 02:42:55,050
You know, Mac -

1463
02:43:35,639 --> 02:43:38,756
Eleven of your men
are being returned today.

1464
02:43:38,851 --> 02:43:40,557
Oh? Who?

1465
02:43:40,644 --> 02:43:42,384
I do not have that information.

1466
02:43:43,063 --> 02:43:44,519
I -

1467
02:43:45,774 --> 02:43:49,062
I am directed by a higher authority
to inform you that -

1468
02:43:51,280 --> 02:43:54,647
that 50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

1469
02:43:56,285 --> 02:43:57,285
Shot?

1470
02:43:58,829 --> 02:44:02,788
Their -
their personal effects will be returned.

1471
02:44:05,336 --> 02:44:06,951
How many of them were wounded?

1472
02:44:09,465 --> 02:44:12,628
Here are the names... of the dead.

1473
02:44:16,055 --> 02:44:17,886
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1474
02:44:19,808 --> 02:44:20,968
None.

1475
02:44:22,227 --> 02:44:25,094
The - the higher authority

1476
02:44:25,856 --> 02:44:28,393
only directs me to inform you that -

1477
02:44:31,487 --> 02:44:32,977
that 50 men were...

1478
02:44:39,578 --> 02:44:40,693
I see.

1479
02:44:42,831 --> 02:44:44,822
Addison, John.

1480
02:44:44,917 --> 02:44:46,953
Alladale, Peter.

1481
02:44:47,044 --> 02:44:49,160
Bancroft, Edward.

1482
02:44:49,254 --> 02:44:51,415
Bartlett, Roger.

1483
02:44:51,507 --> 02:44:53,043
Cavendish, Dennis.

1484
02:44:53,801 --> 02:44:56,213
Eldridge, David.

1485
02:44:56,303 --> 02:44:58,294
Felton, William.

1486
02:44:59,390 --> 02:45:01,346
Fanshaw, Arthur.

1487
02:46:04,288 --> 02:46:06,279
- Au revoir.
- Merci beaucoup, monsieur.

1488
02:46:06,373 --> 02:46:09,206
Au revoir. Au revoir.

1489
02:46:09,293 --> 02:46:10,703
Bonne chance.

1490
02:46:25,642 --> 02:46:27,473
I am your guide, serior.

1491
02:46:27,561 --> 02:46:28,846
To Spain?

1492
02:46:29,938 --> 02:46:31,098
Esparia.

1493
02:46:51,084 --> 02:46:53,746
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1494
02:46:53,837 --> 02:46:56,249
How many have been brought back, sir?
You're the first.

1495
02:46:56,340 --> 02:46:58,581
- Do you know how many got away, sir?
- Not yet.

1496
02:46:59,801 --> 02:47:01,291
What happened to blythe?

1497
02:47:02,596 --> 02:47:04,211
He didn't make it, sir.

1498
02:47:05,098 --> 02:47:07,009
Roger was right about that.

1499
02:47:08,018 --> 02:47:10,100
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it either.

1500
02:47:13,398 --> 02:47:17,061
I've just posted the list. They shot 50.

1501
02:47:17,986 --> 02:47:19,692
The gestapo murdered them.

1502
02:47:21,073 --> 02:47:22,529
Fifty?

1503
02:47:22,616 --> 02:47:24,481
MacDonald, Ashley-pitt?

1504
02:47:25,661 --> 02:47:27,868
- Yes.
- Danny and Willie?

1505
02:47:27,955 --> 02:47:29,536
No, they're not on the list.

1506
02:47:30,332 --> 02:47:32,323
- Haynes?
- Yes.

1507
02:47:34,294 --> 02:47:35,500
I'm sorry.

1508
02:47:37,839 --> 02:47:41,377
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.

1509
02:47:41,468 --> 02:47:42,833
Mess up the works.

1510
02:47:43,887 --> 02:47:46,754
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

1511
02:47:47,599 --> 02:47:49,385
Do you think it was worth the price?

1512
02:47:50,811 --> 02:47:53,097
That depends on your point of view,
hendley.

1513
02:47:56,400 --> 02:47:57,560
Yes, sir.

1514
02:48:11,331 --> 02:48:12,992
Achtung!

1515
02:48:46,491 --> 02:48:47,776
Achtung!

1516
02:48:47,868 --> 02:48:51,406
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

1517
02:48:59,546 --> 02:49:01,377
The job just didn't work out, huh?

1518
02:49:02,174 --> 02:49:03,630
You were lucky, hilts.

1519
02:49:03,717 --> 02:49:05,878
Lucky? It won't be because I didn't...

1520
02:49:07,888 --> 02:49:10,254
- How many?
- Fifty.

1521
02:49:12,893 --> 02:49:14,429
It looks, after all,

1522
02:49:15,145 --> 02:49:17,887
as if you will see Berlin before I do.

1523
02:50:10,784 --> 02:50:11,819
Sir.

1524
02:50:19,418 --> 02:50:20,533
Hey, hilts!
