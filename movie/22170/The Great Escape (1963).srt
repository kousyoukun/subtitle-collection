1
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,700
Go inside.

2
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,500
Hurry up.

3
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,500
This way.

4
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,000
Hurry up.

5
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,400
Yeah, this'll do.
Which one are you gonna have?

6
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,600
- I...
- No, that's mine.

7
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:14,900
Allez hup!

8
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,900
How far are the trees, Danny?

9
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:55,400
Over 200 feet.

10
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:57,200
Yeah, I'd say 300.

11
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Long ways to dig.

12
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:03,400
We'll get Cavendish to make a survey.
I wish Big X were here.

13
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,300
Willie, you think X got away?

14
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,500
He'd have sent us word
somehow if he had.

15
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,600
- Gestapo, you think?
- Either that or he's dead.

16
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,300
- Group Captain Ramsey?
- Yes.

17
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:33,500
I am Hauptfeldwebel Strachwitz.
Will you accompany me, please?

18
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:36,200
- I'll look after your gear, sir.
- Right.

19
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,800
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

20
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,600
Good morning, Group Captain.

21
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:58,200
I'm Captain Posen, Von Luger's adjutant.
Since you're senior British officer,

22
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,200
you are to be liaison between
the prisoners and the colonel.

23
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:06,200
He wishes to make clear to you
certain matters of...

24
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
the word is "policy"?

25
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,600
Yes.

26
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,600
Thank you.

27
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,600
Gruppenkommandeur Ramsey.

28
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,200
I am Colonel Von Luger. Please sit down.

29
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:42,100
Group Captain Ramsey,
in the past four years

30
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,300
the Reich has been forced to spend
an enormous amount of time,

31
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,200
energy, manpower and equipment

32
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,000
hunting down escaping
prisoner-of-war officers.

33
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:54,000
At least it's rather nice
to know you're wanted, isn't it?

34
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:59,100
For us it's not a matter for levity.
There will be no escapes from this camp.

35
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,200
Colonel Von Luger, it is the sworn duty
of all officers to try to escape.

36
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,600
If they can't, it is their duty
to cause the enemy

37
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,400
to use an inordinate number
of troops to guard them

38
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,300
and their sworn duty to harass
the enemy to the best of their ability.

39
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,300
Yes, I know.

40
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,100
The men under your authority
have been most successful.

41
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:21,000
This man, Ashley-Pitt, for example.

42
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:24,900
Caught in the North Sea, escaped,
recaptured, escaped, recaptured.

43
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,700
Archibald "Archie" Ives:
11 escape attempts.

44
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,900
Even tried to jump
out of the truck coming here.

45
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
Dickes, William.

46
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,200
Known to have participated
in digging of 11 escape tunnels.

47
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,600
Flight Lieutenant Willinski: four escapes.

48
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:42,200
MacDonald: nine.
Hendley, the American: five.

49
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:46,100
Haynes: four. Sedgwick: seven.
The list is almost endless.

50
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:49,900
One man here has made
17 attempted escapes.

51
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,300
Group Captain, this is close to insanity.

52
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:55,300
- Quite.
- And it must stop!

53
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Colonel, do you expect officers
to forget their duty?

54
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,800
No.

55
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:08,100
It is because we expect the opposite
that we have brought you here.

56
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:11,400
This is a new camp.

57
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:15,100
It has been built
to hold you and your men.

58
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,700
It is organised to incorporate all
we have learned of security measures.

59
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,900
And in me, you will not be
dealing with a common jailer,

60
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
but with a staff officer
personally selected for the task

61
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:29,000
by the Luftwaffe high command.

62
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:34,900
We have in effect put
all our rotten eggs in one basket,

63
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,100
and we intend to watch
this basket carefully.

64
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:40,200
Very wise.

65
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,100
You will not be denied the usual facilities.

66
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:51,500
Sports, a library, a recreation hall,

67
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,300
and for gardening we will give you tools.

68
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,100
We trust you to use them for gardening.

69
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:01,100
Devote your energies to these things.

70
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,700
Give up your hopeless
attempts to escape.

71
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,900
And, with intelligent cooperation,

72
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,100
we may all sit out the war

73
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,100
as comfortably as possible.

74
00:10:30,700 --> 00:10:33,800
- What do you do here by the truck?
- I'm stealing tools.

75
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,100
- For stealing tools, cooler.
- I was only kidding.

76
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,500
- Oh, you're American.
- Yes, and you're a German.

77
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,300
Of course.
Why do you come to Germany?

78
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:46,200
- Why fight for England, your enemy?
- Enemy? What are you talkin' about?

79
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,900
- In 181 2 they burned your capital.
- That's propaganda.

80
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
It's in the history books. I read it.

81
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:56,100
Now go away from here.
If you steal tools, cooler.

82
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:58,100
Yeah. No tools.

83
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,900
Hey, Virgil.

84
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,700
Hey, did you see the cooler?

85
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,500
Boy, is it ever a big one!

86
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:11,900
- I think they expect a lot of business.
- Yeah.

87
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:16,300
Those two guys who were with us in
the old camp, in hut 14, I can't find them.

88
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:19,500
- You think the goons left 'em behind?
- I guess.

89
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,100
What were their names?
It was Jackson and...

90
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,300
- And Dexter.
- Dexter. That's right.

91
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,400
I'm gonna see who else I can find.
I'll see you later.

92
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:54,200
Hey, Danny. Who are they?

93
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,100
Russian prisoners. They cut down trees.

94
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:00,000
- They keep them here?
- No, they take them out.

95
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,400
Willie, cigarettes.

96
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:27,400
Danny and I have a blitz in mind. Could
you put on a brief show for the goons?

97
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,200
Sure, man. What'll it be? An all-out go?

98
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,700
- Choir practice?
- Knuckles, eh?

99
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,800
- Yeah. Knuckles will be fine.
- Give him the coat.

100
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,300
- What are you doing with my coat, mate?
- What? It's mine!

101
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Are you pushing me?

102
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,300
That's mine, you son of a...

103
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,700
Stop it! Stop this nonsense!

104
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,200
It's all right, mate. We're just
having a friendly little argument.

105
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:22,000
- No more fighting. No more!
- All right.

106
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,800
- Back in your huts.
- Yes, sir.

107
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,800
You, too!

108
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,200
Get away! Get back in your huts!

109
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,800
Go on!

110
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:07,200
Hey, Hilts. Looks like there's only
one other American in the whole camp.

111
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,900
Some guy named Hendley
in the RAF Eagle squadron.

112
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,600
Hey, you got something goin' already?

113
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,900
See the way the goons
got those towers placed?

114
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,900
- There's a blind spot through the middle.
- A blind spot?

115
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,800
A guy could stand at that wire
and not be seen by either tower.

116
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:24,900
They'd never see me, especially at night.

117
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,700
- You're crazy.
- You think so? Let's find out right now.

118
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,800
Now, the next step's a little tricky.

119
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:51,700
- You're not goin' out there?
- Not while they're lookin', I'm not.

120
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,200
I think I'll take a little walk.

121
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,100
- Danny, you speak Russian?
- Only one sentence.

122
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,100
Let me have it, mate.

123
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:51,500
- What's it mean?
- I love you.

124
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,800
I love you? What bloody good is that?

125
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:56,600
I don't know.
I wasn't going to use it myself.

126
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,200
Out. Out!

127
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,200
- Your friend, yes?
- Huh?

128
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:30,600
And who vouches for you,
Lieutenant Willinski?

129
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,600
Get out, Sedgwick.

130
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:09,900
Hold it, hold it!

131
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,600
- Your name?
- Ives.

132
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,200
Ives.

133
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,200
Ives. Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.

134
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,700
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

135
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:28,100
I'd like to see one of you
under similar circumstances.

136
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,600
I will not take action against you now.

137
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,500
This is the first day here and there has
been much stupidity and carelessness...

138
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,500
on both sides.

139
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,300
Hey! Get out!

140
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,900
Don't shoot!

141
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,900
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

142
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,700
- What wire?
- This wire! The warning wire!

143
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,400
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it.
You know that.

144
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,900
But my baseball rolled over there.
How am I gonna get my baseball?

145
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,800
- You first ask permission.
- Oh, OK.

146
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:49,600
- Gettin' my baseball.
- Stop this! Get over the wire immediately!

147
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,500
- OK.
- You stay there!

148
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,800
Out of the way. Out.

149
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,200
What are you doing
over here by the wire?

150
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,600
Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...

151
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,400
- What were you doing by the wire?
- Well, like I told Max...

152
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,800
I was trying to cut my way through
your wire, because I wanna get out.

153
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,200
Do you speak German?

154
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,900
Wire cutters.

155
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,700
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite
a number of British officers in this war.

156
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,900
And I flatter myself
that we understand one another.

157
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:51,800
You are the first American officer
I have met. Hilts, isn't it?

158
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,800
Captain Hilts, actually.

159
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,700
- 17 escape attempts.
- 18, sir.

160
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,700
- Tunnel man, engineer.
- Flier.

161
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:03,000
I suppose what's called
in the American army a "hotshot pilot".

162
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,400
Unfortunately,
you were shot down anyway.

163
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,200
So we are both grounded
for the duration of the war.

164
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,700
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.

165
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,200
- You have other plans?
- I haven't seen Berlin yet.

166
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:21,100
I plan on doing so before the war's over.

167
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:24,600
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

168
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,400
About 99 per cent.

169
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:30,600
Perhaps while you are with us,
you will have a chance to learn some.

170
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,400
10 days isolation, Hilts.

171
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,100
- Captain Hilts.
- 20 days.

172
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,500
Right.

173
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,000
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

174
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,200
Cooler.

175
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:54,000
- Name?
- Ives.

176
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,900
Flying Officer Ives.

177
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,900
Cooler. 20 days.

178
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,200
- Cooler, Ives.
- Pleasure.

179
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,300
- Hilts.
- Yeah?

180
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,500
What did you do in the States?
Play baseball?

181
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,500
No, I was in college.

182
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,400
- Say, Ives.
- Aye?

183
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:52,500
- How many escapes have you tried?
- Four over, seven under.

184
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:57,600
- Tunnel man, huh?
- Sure, I am that.

185
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,700
How tall are you, Ives?

186
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,500
Five feet four. Why?

187
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,200
Oh, just wondering.

188
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,100
What did you do in college?
Study physical education?

189
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:14,500
Chemical engineering.
Did a little bike riding, though.

190
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
Bicycles?

191
00:23:16,800 --> 00:23:21,400
Motorcycles. Flat tracks, county fairs.
Picked up a buck here and there.

192
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:25,000
- Helped pay my tuition.
- I did a wee bit of racing myself.

193
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,900
- In Scotland.
- Bikes?

194
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,400
No, horse racing. Jockey.

195
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,300
Jockey.

196
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:38,300
Jockey.

197
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:43,900
Hilts?

198
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,100
Are you there, Hilts?

199
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,300
Yeah, I'm here.

200
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,100
Don't you have them in the States?
Jockeys?

201
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,700
Sure.

202
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:01,200
They were the days. Saturday nights
in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.

203
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,100
You had to fight off the birds.

204
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,100
You know, birds.

205
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:08,100
Girls, man. Girls.

206
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,000
Do you not have them in the States?

207
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,200
Hilts?

208
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,200
Are you there, Hilts?

209
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,600
Ives.

210
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,100
What?

211
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:28,700
You know the kind of clay and gravel
we got here in the compound?

212
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:31,700
How many feet do you think
you could get through in eight hours?

213
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:36,100
I could go through this dirt here
like the bit on an end of an auger.

214
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:39,800
But you know it's not the digging.
It's the shoring up with wood

215
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,300
and getting the dirt out -
that's what you've to worry about.

216
00:24:43,300 --> 00:24:46,100
No, it isn't, Ives.
You don't have to worry about that.

217
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:48,400
How are you going to get the dirt out?

218
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:52,300
- What do they call a mole in Scotland?
- A mole.

219
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,300
Aye.

220
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,400
Well, what do you think?

221
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:02,900
I must say,
it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

222
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,800
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

223
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,500
As the sergeant out there says,
this is only the first day.

224
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,800
Eric.

225
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:31,000
Don't take too much notice.
The goons may not know who he is.

226
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:33,800
- I'll pass the word.
- I'll tell the old man.

227
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,000
He has arrived.

228
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:49,400
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged
into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

229
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,700
I suggest this prisoner be kept

230
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,200
under the strictest
security confinement permanently.

231
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,900
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

232
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,300
We have reason to believe
he is the leader

233
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,300
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

234
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,200
Squadron Leader Bartlett
has been three months in your care,

235
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,700
and the Gestapo has only
"reason to believe"?

236
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,600
If he once more falls into our hands,
he will not be so lucky.

237
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:30,100
Air-force officer prisoners are
the responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

238
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,000
not the SS,

239
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,500
or the Gestapo.

240
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,200
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.

241
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,800
That is why he is returned
for the moment to your care.

242
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,600
Of course, if the Luftwaffe
is not up to the task,

243
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,700
the prisoners will find themselves
totally in our charge.

244
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:51,600
We regretfully are not
so professionally understanding.

245
00:26:55,800 --> 00:26:58,000
Squadron Leader Bartlett,

246
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:02,900
if you escape again and be caught,
you will be shot.

247
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:18,800
Herr Kuhn.

248
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:01,000
- Eric.
- Hello, Roger.

249
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:03,400
- They dumped you here, too.
- What's this one like?

250
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:05,400
Well, it's new.

251
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,200
Here. Let's find you a bed.

252
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:11,200
Thanks.

253
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,600
Come in.

254
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:32,000
- Hello, Roger.
- Hello, sir.

255
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,500
- I'll put your bag in your room.
- Thanks, Eric.

256
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:39,400
- How are you?
- As well as can be expected.

257
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:42,800
The fellows wanted to put up
a welcome committee, but that's for later.

258
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,200
- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac.
- A lot of old friends here.

259
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,900
- How long have you been here, sir?
- Arrived today.

260
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,500
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

261
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,500
You met the commandant?

262
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,400
Yes, I did.

263
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:01,500
What were the Gestapo
and the SS doing with you?

264
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:04,200
They wanted to find out
who helped me to the border.

265
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,100
Who else is here? Cavendish?

266
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:08,900
- Nimmo and Sorren?
- Griffith, Haynes.

267
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,900
- Blythe?
- Yes.

268
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:14,000
Almost the whole X organisation.

269
00:29:14,100 --> 00:29:18,900
Almost. They cleaned out all the other
camps and dumped us in this one.

270
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,400
As Von Luger put it:
"All the rotten eggs in one basket."

271
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:25,600
There's madness in their method.

272
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,100
What about Tommy Bristol?

273
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,400
No, but there's an American - Hendley.

274
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,800
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?

275
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,400
- MacDonald says he's the best.
- Good.

276
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,700
Last of the tea until
the Red Cross gets through again.

277
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,000
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

278
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,900
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?

279
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,700
Not nearly as rough
as I now intend to give them.

280
00:29:55,600 --> 00:30:00,100
Roger, personal revenge must be
kept out of what we have to do here.

281
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,400
Too many lives are at stake.

282
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:08,400
What my personal feelings are
is of no importance.

283
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:12,400
You appointed me Big X,
and it's my duty to harass,

284
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:15,200
confound and confuse the enemy
to the best of my ability.

285
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:18,300
- That's true.
- That's what I intend to do.

286
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:23,700
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink
in this Third Reich of theirs

287
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:27,800
that thousands of troops'll be
tied up here looking after us.

288
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,200
How?

289
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:32,200
By putting more men out of this

290
00:30:32,300 --> 00:30:35,100
perfect camp of theirs
than have ever escaped before.

291
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,900
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300.
Scatter them all over Germany.

292
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,300
- Think that's possible?
- The men are here to do it.

293
00:30:42,500 --> 00:30:46,900
The goons have put every escape artist
in Germany here. You said so yourself.

294
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,600
Have you thought of what it might cost?

295
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:56,100
I've thought of the humiliation
if we just tamely submit,

296
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,400
knuckle under and crawl.

297
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:01,500
Surely you don't advocate that,
do you, sir?

298
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,300
I have to point out
one thing to you, Roger.

299
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:07,300
No matter how unsatisfactory
this camp may be,

300
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,300
the high command have left us
in the hands of the Luftwaffe,

301
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,400
not the Gestapo and the SS.

302
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:18,100
Look, sir, you talk about
the high command of the Luftwaffe,

303
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:19,700
then the SS and the Gestapo.

304
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:23,600
To me they're the same.
We're fighting the bloody lot.

305
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,600
There's only one way to put it, sir.

306
00:31:25,700 --> 00:31:29,200
They are the common enemies of
everyone who believes in freedom.

307
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,200
If they didn't approve of Hitler,
why didn't they throw him out?

308
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:34,900
I have no argument with you, Roger.

309
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,800
As senior officer, I'm merely
pointing out a pertinent fact.

310
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,500
When are you calling a meeting, X?

311
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:54,200
Tonight.

312
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:10,900
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the
immortal words of our new commandant.

313
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:13,400
"Devote your energies
to things other than escape

314
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:15,700
and sit out the war
as comfortably as possible."

315
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:21,000
Well, that's exactly
what we're going to do.

316
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:24,200
We're going to devote our energies
to sports and gardening,

317
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:27,000
all the cultural pursuits
as far as they're concerned.

318
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,000
In fact, we're going to
put the goons to sleep.

319
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,500
Meanwhile, we dig.

320
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:37,900
Now, even a superficial look
at the compound

321
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,100
shows us that huts 104 and 5
are closest to the woods.

322
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,400
The first tunnel goes out from 105,

323
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,400
directly east
under the cooler and the wire.

324
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:48,600
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

325
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,500
- Did you make a survey, Dennis?
- Only a temporary one, sir.

326
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,100
- I make it just over 335 feet.
- Tell me when you've got an exact one.

327
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:59,000
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down
30 feet before we go horizontal.

328
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,400
That'll rule out any question
of sound detection or probing.

329
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:05,700
All right, Roger,
but did you say the first tunnel?

330
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,700
I did. There'll be three.

331
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:13,900
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry.
Tom goes out directly east from 104.

332
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:18,900
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and
Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.

333
00:33:20,400 --> 00:33:23,500
If the goons find one,
we'll move into the other.

334
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,300
How many men do you
plan to take out, Roger?

335
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,500
250.

336
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:34,400
There'll be no half measures this time.
Identification papers for everyone.

337
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,600
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.

338
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:40,100
- 250?
- Mostly civilian clothes.

339
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,100
Yes, but...

340
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,200
OK, Roger.

341
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:49,900
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations,
compasses for all the walkers.

342
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,200
- Timetables for every train.
- Right, Roger.

343
00:33:57,700 --> 00:34:00,700
- Sorry I'm late, Roger.
- It's all right, Colin. Sit down.

344
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,700
We're going to tunnel.

345
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,000
Splendid.

346
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:11,700
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings.
Danny, you'll be in charge of traps.

347
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Sedgwick, manufacturer.
Griff, as I said, tailor.

348
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:19,600
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions. Mac,
of course, will take care of intelligence.

349
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,000
Hendley. We haven't met.

350
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,000
- Scrounger?
- Right.

351
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,300
Dennis, maps and surveys.

352
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:31,800
Colin, you'll take your usual job. Eric,
how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?

353
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:36,700
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated
three tunnels, but we'll manage.

354
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:40,000
Roger, who's going to handle
security for all this?

355
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:44,100
You are. I want a system of stooges
covering this compound

356
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,000
from front to back,
checking every goon in and out.

357
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:52,200
I want a signal system so perfect
that if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet

358
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:56,600
of any of the huts in which we're working,
we can shut down without a sign.

359
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,300
Well, I don't think there's much point
in discussing any more now.

360
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:06,100
I'll meet each of you on the exercise
circuit, and we'll pound out the details.

361
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,400
Nothing else, is there, Mac?

362
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,700
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

363
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:39,500
Oh, hello.

364
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:41,100
My name's Blythe.

365
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,400
Hendley.

366
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:50,600
- For birds.
- I used to do a little hunting myself.

367
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,300
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

368
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,900
Oh, a bird watcher?

369
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:00,600
Yes, that's right.
Watching them and drawing them.

370
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,700
I suppose you have
bird watchers in the States?

371
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,900
Yes, we have some.

372
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:10,400
Tea?

373
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,900
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.

374
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:17,500
Where's your kit?

375
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:21,700
This is it. The rest was confiscated
in the last shakedown.

376
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,800
The goons didn't appreciate
some of my more personal items.

377
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,600
Such as.

378
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:35,200
- You're the scrounger.
- Yes, that's right.

379
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,800
I'll need a camera.

380
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:41,400
- What kind?
- A good one.

381
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:46,600
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter
should do all right.

382
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,100
All right.

383
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,500
- And film, of course.
- Oh, of course.

384
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,700
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.

385
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,100
- Only one?
- Two would be better.

386
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,800
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.

387
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,800
I must have used these
wretched leaves about 20 times.

388
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,300
It's not that I mind so much.

389
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,000
Tea without milk is so uncivilised.

390
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:18,600
Yeah.

391
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,400
I'll get our wood.

392
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,800
Close up! Close up!

393
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,400
Close up!

394
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,400
Close up!

395
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:43,700
Close up!

396
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,800
- No me sprechen the English.
- Close up!

397
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,500
Splendid.

398
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:27,200
Blythe, what are you doing here?

399
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,700
I'm in Photographic Aerial
Reconnaissance lnterpretation.

400
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:35,500
Went for a joyride to see for myself.
It's my own silly fault.

401
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:40,300
The aircraft bought it.
Got shot down. Terrifying.

402
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:45,100
- No, I mean, what do you do here?
- Here?

403
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:49,200
I'm the forger.

404
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:10,900
Forgers are installing themselves
in the recreation hut.

405
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,300
- Sedgwick?
- I'm in 1 10.

406
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:16,000
- Griffith.
- Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

407
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,100
109? Right.

408
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:22,600
I'll work in 107. For now, Danny, Willie
and their trap team will be in 104.

409
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:26,800
I want to take a chance on the tunnels
and press ahead without any shoring-up.

410
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:30,000
We will need timber for the shafts
and the entrance chambers.

411
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:32,700
Hendley figures
there are 36 empty bunks.

412
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:36,300
We can tear up 1 5 and move the men
around so the goons won't miss them.

413
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,400
The rest will come
from strips off the wall.

414
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:41,400
- Is Hendley taking care of this himself?
- Not yet.

415
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:44,300
He's working on some steel
for a pick that Danny needs.

416
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:03,900
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

417
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,200
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

418
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:09,500
Get away!

419
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:13,400
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

420
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,100
Stop this nonsense!

421
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,200
Get away!

422
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:21,900
Turn the water off!

423
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:22,900
Somewhere!

424
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:06,200
In the stove, we keep fire burning always.
The goons will not feel like moving it.

425
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,400
- Good.
- Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped.

426
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:13,600
- We need new ones.
- There's some in 1 1 3's washroom.

427
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,500
- Should match perfectly.
- Good.

428
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:26,900
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

429
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:30,100
Not when you're organised, Mac.

430
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,700
- We're ready.
- Big enough?

431
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:40,600
It's perfect. Right through
the middle of the foundation.

432
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:47,800
Good luck to us, Danny.

433
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,200
Why 17?

434
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,200
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

435
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,700
All right?

436
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:00,000
It's good.

437
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,300
It's very good.

438
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,000
Get out! Get out!

439
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:15,000
You're not in your hut?
What are you doing here?

440
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,000
Mopping up.

441
00:44:20,300 --> 00:44:23,100
- And you?
- Shower. I need a wash.

442
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:29,700
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

443
00:44:34,100 --> 00:44:37,400
Put on warm clothes.
You might be outside all night.

444
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,900
No. I vote no. Look, we've put
the goons to sleep exactly like you said.

445
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:32,300
But just one little thing like this
and we're up the creek without a paddle.

446
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,600
- Ives, sit down, won't you?
- Hello, sir.

447
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:38,400
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett,
Captain Hilts.

448
00:45:38,600 --> 00:45:41,000
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.

449
00:45:41,200 --> 00:45:44,600
I understand you two
are contemplating a blitz-out.

450
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,800
Where'd you hear that... sir?

451
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:50,600
MacDonald. It's Mac's job
to know everything that goes on.

452
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,400
We thought perhaps we might talk it over.

453
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:55,800
Why? It's only a two-man job.

454
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,500
Everybody in the camp is supposed to
clear all escape attempts in advance

455
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,900
with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.

456
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,400
We don't necessarily want to interfere.

457
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:09,500
It's just that... well, what sort of blitz
were you contemplating?

458
00:46:10,100 --> 00:46:13,200
We sneak out at night to a spot
I found near the wire - a blind spot.

459
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,700
Then we dig down, take the dirt,
spread it on top so it won't make a pile,

460
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:18,500
and then straight out.

461
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:22,400
Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs
in front, pushes the dirt behind him.

462
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:26,100
I stash it behind me, then we burrow
through the dirt like a couple of moles.

463
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:31,000
By dawn we're under the wire, across
the open space, into the woods and gone.

464
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,200
Well...

465
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:43,300
When do you intend to try this?

466
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,000
- When do you intend to try it?
- Oh, tonight.

467
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:51,300
Hilts, this may not be quite
the right time for this sort of thing.

468
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:54,600
Look, sir, I've been in the bag
nearly three years now,

469
00:46:54,700 --> 00:46:56,900
bloody close to being wire-happy.

470
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,900
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

471
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,800
It'll work. I know it will.

472
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:11,900
Good luck.

473
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,900
Thank you.

474
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:19,800
- Hilts, um... how do you breathe?
- We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

475
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,400
We shove it up and make air holes
as we go along.

476
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:24,400
Good night, sir.

477
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,800
Now, why didn't anybody
think of that before?

478
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:36,200
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

479
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:39,200
But it'll bring every goon
in the camp down on top of us.

480
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:41,600
I don't know.
Perhaps we're being too clever.

481
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:43,600
If we stop all the breakouts,

482
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,200
it may only convince the goons
that we must be tunnelling.

483
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:52,700
I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're going
to be in the cooler for an awful long time.

484
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:39,400
- Good, huh?
- Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

485
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,100
- This is the dirt from the compound.
- This is from the tunnel.

486
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:58,200
Wherever we put it,
they're going to spot it a mile away.

487
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:01,300
Maybe we could put it under the huts.
The dirt's dark there.

488
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,800
It's the first place the ferrets would look.
I saw one measuring yesterday.

489
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,200
Maybe we could dry it to the same colour.

490
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:11,100
- There are 50 tons of it.
- I was just thinking out loud.

491
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,400
If you must think,
for God's sake, think clearly.

492
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:17,400
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

493
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:22,100
We can't destroy the dirt
and we can't eat it.

494
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,300
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.

495
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,000
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

496
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:31,500
Didn't they teach you
promptness in the RN?

497
00:49:31,600 --> 00:49:34,500
You'll never believe it,
but I think I have the solution.

498
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:38,600
The problem is somehow to get rid of
this tunnel dirt over the compound.

499
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,600
Well, of course.

500
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,100
Would you mind?

501
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,500
Now...

502
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,500
you fill these bags
with the dirt from the tunnel.

503
00:49:59,600 --> 00:50:02,800
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

504
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:05,100
you wander out into the compound

505
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:09,100
where you pull these
strings in your pockets.

506
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,200
Out come the pins.

507
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:19,700
- Eric, it's good.
- All you have to do is kick it in.

508
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,400
Unless you're a fool,
the ferrets won't see a thing.

509
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:25,400
It's indecently brilliant.
What do you think, Roger?

510
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:29,500
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow.
- I already have. It works.

511
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:33,700
Mac, this is what we'll do.

512
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:50,900
- A little present from Tom, sir.
- Thank you, Nimmo.

513
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,100
Nice garden you've got, sir.

514
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,800
All right. Let's look sharp.

515
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:42,700
That looks sharp.

516
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:48,600
Sir.

517
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,000
Please, gentlemen, continue.
This is merely a routine inspection.

518
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:13,100
- Good morning, Squadron Leader.
- Good morning, sir.

519
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,200
I am sorry the soil here isn't
better suited to your men's purpose.

520
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:19,200
We'll manage, sir.

521
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,300
I must say I am surprised with
the extent of this activity, Group Captain.

522
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:36,100
- Pleased, of course, but surprised.
- Surprised, Colonel?

523
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:41,700
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants
to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.

524
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:43,900
The English are keen on gardening.

525
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,900
Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?

526
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:50,600
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

527
00:52:52,700 --> 00:52:54,600
Good point.

528
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,000
I have the nasty feeling
he knows exactly what we're doing.

529
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:17,200
- Maybe he does.
- You don't really think so, do you?

530
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,700
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

531
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:32,900
- Morning, Bob.
- Andy.

532
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,200
Here we are. Now, let's see.

533
00:53:36,300 --> 00:53:38,700
Biscuits, two packets.

534
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:41,000
Coffee, two tins.

535
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,300
Bovril, one jar.

536
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:45,900
Cigarettes, six packets.

537
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:50,200
Strawberry jam, Sorren's.
Black currant jam, Cavendish.

538
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,300
And marmalade, mine.

539
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:56,600
Danish butter, Von Luger's.
I liberated it from his mess supplies.

540
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:01,200
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

541
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,400
That cleans out the gift food
for the entire organisation.

542
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,600
Now, the first thing we need
is the new form of travel permit.

543
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:11,500
The forgers have no idea
what it looks like.

544
00:54:11,600 --> 00:54:12,900
I'll see what I can do.

545
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:16,500
And, of course, any other
identity cards, personal papers,

546
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:18,700
documents you can put your hands on.

547
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,900
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob.
- Right.

548
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,900
Good luck.

549
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:34,500
O come all ye faithful

550
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:37,700
Joyful and triumphant

551
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,700
O come ye

552
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:45,200
O come ye to Bethlehem

553
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:48,600
Come and behold Him

554
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,700
Born the King of Angels

555
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:55,300
O come let us adore Him

556
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:58,700
O come let us adore Him

557
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:03,300
O come let us adore Him

558
00:55:03,400 --> 00:55:05,800
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

559
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:07,800
Patience is a virtue, Roger.

560
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:11,600
Yes, I know, but the diggers
can only work when the trap's open,

561
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,000
and this is holding us up very badly.

562
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:17,800
- Is it finished?
- Of course.

563
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,700
- Why isn't it in?
- Working on the air ducts now.

564
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:24,000
- Well, when will they be finished?
- One or two days.

565
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,500
- Does it work?
- Of course it works.

566
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,600
- Will it give us enough air?
- As much as you'll need.

567
00:55:31,200 --> 00:55:32,700
Mac.

568
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,700
Excellent.

569
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,900
Have it in by tomorrow night.

570
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,200
Christ the Lord

571
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:50,500
- Got a light?
- Yeah.

572
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:55,100
Thanks.

573
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,400
- It's pretty, isn't it?
- Yes.

574
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:07,700
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

575
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:13,100
I'll smoke it later when I'm off duty.
Thank you.

576
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,100
You probably have
a couple of roommates, huh?

577
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:21,800
- Beautiful day.
- Yes, but I think it might rain later.

578
00:56:21,900 --> 00:56:23,300
No, no.

579
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:26,400
Red sky in the morning,
sailor takes warning.

580
00:56:26,500 --> 00:56:28,500
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

581
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:30,600
It was a red sky last night.

582
00:56:30,700 --> 00:56:32,500
I never heard that before.

583
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:34,800
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

584
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:37,400
- You were a Boy Scout? So was l.
- Really?

585
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:40,300
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges.
- I had 20.

586
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:44,800
I was working on my 20th when
the government abolished scouting

587
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:48,500
and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.

588
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:55,300
Werner, you think you'll stay
in the army after the war?

589
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:58,100
No. I'm not a well man.

590
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,000
- And my teeth...
- Your teeth?

591
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:02,700
Yes. I could tell you
stories about my teeth

592
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:05,000
that would make your hair stand on end.

593
00:57:05,100 --> 00:57:07,400
Our dentist here is a butcher.

594
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,200
But don't tell anyone I said so.

595
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,300
It's a soldier's right to complain.

596
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,800
Maybe in your army, but here?

597
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:21,600
One little criticism,
and... to the Russian front.

598
00:57:21,700 --> 00:57:25,100
Is that so? Terrible.

599
00:57:26,000 --> 00:57:27,800
That's terrible.

600
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:34,900
Werner.

601
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:39,600
Why don't we go into my room?

602
00:57:39,700 --> 00:57:42,600
I'd better not.
If Strachwitz should see me...

603
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:47,700
I was just gonna make some coffee.

604
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:52,100
Real coffee.

605
00:58:19,200 --> 00:58:21,800
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

606
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,800
Where is it?

607
00:58:29,700 --> 00:58:32,800
My grandmother keeps
sending me this stuff.

608
00:58:38,100 --> 00:58:40,400
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

609
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,300
Yeah. Keep it.

610
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:52,300
Nein. I must go.

611
00:58:53,000 --> 00:58:55,600
It's OK. You can keep it. We're friends.

612
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:58,700
With you in the cooler,
will we be friends? I must report this.

613
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:03,900
I don't understand you. Report what?
That you and I were chatting in my room?

614
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,700
- I must go.
- Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.

615
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,300
I'll never be able to eat it all.
I've got all I could eat.

616
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:12,900
I'm sorry. All right. Forget it. Forget it.

617
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:48,400
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember,
is the voice of the Nelles warbler.

618
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,800
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman -
the masked shrike.

619
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,300
Lanius nubicus. The butcherbird.

620
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,800
The shrike impales his foes
on the spikes of thorn bushes.

621
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,600
Not a very lovable character, you see.
Let's have a look at the colouring.

622
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:05,000
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

623
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:10,300
A black rump, a black crown with a bold
white flash, and a white line over the eye.

624
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,100
The shrike lives
in lightly wooded country...

625
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:17,100
Ah. Hendley. Sit down. You'll find
drawing materials on the table.

626
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:21,600
The shrike lives in lightly wooded
country, olive groves and gardens.

627
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,100
Well, Hendley, have you
taken to birds too now?

628
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:26,700
Yeah. Stick around.
You might learn something.

629
01:00:26,900 --> 01:00:29,400
I have better things to do than draw birds.

630
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:35,300
The voice is a monotonous succession
of scratchy, complaining notes.

631
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,800
Now, let's have a good look at this bird.
He's got a round shape...

632
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:02,200
An Urlaubsschein. Permission to
cross a frontier. Here's another one.

633
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:04,600
Which one's the forgery?

634
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,000
- That one.
- That's right.

635
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,800
They both are.

636
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:13,300
What's holding us up now is
the new form of this travel permit.

637
01:01:13,500 --> 01:01:16,200
- We've no idea what they look like.
- Here's one.

638
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,300
And a military identity card.

639
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:22,500
And a...

640
01:01:22,700 --> 01:01:24,200
- An Ausweis.
- Yeah.

641
01:01:24,300 --> 01:01:28,100
- Permission to be on Reich property.
- A ticket to Oden.

642
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:32,100
What appears to be the ferret
assignments for the next week.

643
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:34,900
You get 10 out of 10 for this, old boy.

644
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:38,800
- Thank you, sir. Take good care of that.
- Where did you get this?

645
01:01:39,800 --> 01:01:41,700
It's on loan.

646
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:45,800
In order to get
the right amount of outfits, Roger,

647
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,300
I suggest that we work
mainly from service uniforms.

648
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,100
I can do double-breasteds,
single-breasteds,

649
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,000
and rather nice lounge suits.

650
01:01:56,100 --> 01:01:58,600
Lapels. I can do quite a lot
of things with those.

651
01:01:58,700 --> 01:02:03,200
I can have them deep like that
or high ones like that.

652
01:02:04,400 --> 01:02:07,300
Here's one that
we're working on right now.

653
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,900
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

654
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:15,500
Take a look at those.
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

655
01:02:17,500 --> 01:02:23,700
And here's one that I dyed
with a bottle of blue ink.

656
01:02:25,100 --> 01:02:28,100
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?

657
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:31,100
The goons'd have a field day
if they crashed in on this lot.

658
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:35,400
That's Sorren's department. Now, I've
started working on the other materials.

659
01:02:35,500 --> 01:02:37,400
This blanket.

660
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:40,500
Particularly the stripes. Marvellous.

661
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:41,700
- Coats.
- Yes.

662
01:02:41,900 --> 01:02:44,600
I've got the chaps working on these
all over the compound.

663
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:47,500
Those battle dresses -
I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

664
01:02:47,700 --> 01:02:52,300
I'll have to get the chaps to make those
into some sort of workingman's outfits.

665
01:02:52,400 --> 01:02:54,600
Blanket ticking.

666
01:02:54,700 --> 01:02:59,200
Now, I've made these into
rather nice little waistcoats.

667
01:02:59,400 --> 01:03:02,700
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course.
- Of course.

668
01:03:02,900 --> 01:03:05,200
Just take a look at this, Roger.

669
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,300
Now, this blanket material, we scrape
this down until it's really smooth,

670
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:12,600
and then dye it with boot polish.

671
01:03:12,700 --> 01:03:16,500
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley.
I wish we had more of this.

672
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:19,400
- Where in God's name did you get these?
- Hendley.

673
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,700
- Where did he get them?
- I asked him that.

674
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:24,400
- What did he say?
- "Don't ask."

675
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,500
Let me show you some of the overcoats
I've been working on.

676
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:58,100
Good morning, Hilts.

677
01:03:59,700 --> 01:04:02,700
Well, if you're here to find out
if I'm going out again, I am.

678
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:04,800
- When?
- 17 days. 7th of July.

679
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:06,700
- Dark of the moon.
- Correct.

680
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,200
Is Ives going with you?

681
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:11,900
Yeah, if he wants to.

682
01:04:12,100 --> 01:04:15,300
You know that Ives is close to cracking?

683
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:18,300
Yeah.

684
01:04:19,500 --> 01:04:22,800
- Better for him to go out in the tunnel?
- Safer.

685
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,400
Right.

686
01:04:31,600 --> 01:04:35,100
It's possible for one man to get out
through the wire, even get away,

687
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:40,600
but there are in fact a considerable
number of people besides yourself

688
01:04:40,700 --> 01:04:42,900
in this camp who are trying to escape.

689
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:45,800
I appreciate that.

690
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:50,000
Something's coming - I can feel it -

691
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:53,600
and it's coming right around the corner
at me, Squadron Leader.

692
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:55,900
- My name's Roger.
- All right, Roger.

693
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,300
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

694
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,000
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

695
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:07,100
Yes, well, as I was saying, Hilts,

696
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:11,100
we have maps of Germany -
general maps, that is.

697
01:05:11,200 --> 01:05:15,200
We have all the information we need
for the escape routes out of Germany.

698
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:17,400
But what we do not have...

699
01:05:17,500 --> 01:05:20,800
Is a clear idea of what's 500 yards
beyond those trees.

700
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,700
We've tried every goon in the camp.
No go.

701
01:05:23,800 --> 01:05:27,400
We must know the exact position
of the local town.

702
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:30,300
We want to know where
we hit the main roads.

703
01:05:30,500 --> 01:05:33,900
Where the police stations are,
where they've got their roadblocks.

704
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:38,300
And most important of all,
we've got to know how to get from here

705
01:05:38,500 --> 01:05:40,800
to the railway station.

706
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:44,200
No. Absolutely not.
When I get through that wire,

707
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:46,900
I'm not gonna be
making maps for you guys.

708
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:52,400
I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear
if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

709
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:55,200
- Understandable.
- Completely.

710
01:05:57,500 --> 01:05:59,800
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

711
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:05,600
Interesting idea.

712
01:06:05,700 --> 01:06:08,800
- How many you taking out?
- 250.

713
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,400
250?

714
01:06:13,500 --> 01:06:15,300
Yeah.

715
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,800
You're crazy. You too.

716
01:06:17,900 --> 01:06:21,300
250 guys just walking down the road,
just like that.

717
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:25,100
Well, some on the road, some by train,
some cross-country.

718
01:06:25,300 --> 01:06:27,500
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

719
01:06:27,600 --> 01:06:29,400
maps, compasses, rations.

720
01:06:29,600 --> 01:06:32,300
You're gonna alert
every goon in the country.

721
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:35,400
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork
is gonna be out looking for you.

722
01:06:35,500 --> 01:06:40,300
They're gonna swoop down and scoop
you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

723
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,800
Yes, well, thanks, anyway.

724
01:06:44,900 --> 01:06:48,000
- If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.
- That's good of you.

725
01:06:48,200 --> 01:06:50,000
Any time.

726
01:06:51,300 --> 01:06:56,500
Wait a minute. You aren't seriously
suggesting that if I get through the wire

727
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:59,500
and case everything out there
and don't get picked up,

728
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:02,300
to turn myself in
and get thrown back in the cooler

729
01:07:02,500 --> 01:07:04,800
so you can get the information you need?

730
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:09,400
Yes. One has to ask some very
strange things in the job I have.

731
01:07:09,500 --> 01:07:12,500
- We'll give you a front place.
- I wouldn't do that for my own mother.

732
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,400
- I don't blame you.
- Well, OK, then.

733
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:17,300
- It's completely understandable.
- Well, OK, then.

734
01:07:19,700 --> 01:07:21,600
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

735
01:07:28,700 --> 01:07:30,600
Check.

736
01:07:33,500 --> 01:07:35,200
Herr Hendley, l...

737
01:07:35,300 --> 01:07:37,600
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

738
01:07:40,500 --> 01:07:44,200
- What's the matter, Werner?
- My wallet, my papers, my identity card.

739
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,400
Gone. I lost them. Everything.

740
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:50,100
He lost his wallet.

741
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,500
Do you realise what would happen
if Strachwitz found this out?

742
01:07:53,600 --> 01:07:55,600
- The Russian front.
- Dear, dear.

743
01:07:58,800 --> 01:08:01,200
I've looked every place, every place.

744
01:08:02,100 --> 01:08:05,500
I must have lost them while I was in here.

745
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:07,900
- No.
- Yes.

746
01:08:08,100 --> 01:08:11,700
Look, I told you we were friends.
We'll find them.

747
01:08:11,800 --> 01:08:14,100
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

748
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,100
Werner.

749
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:20,200
Not now. It might look a little peculiar

750
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,700
if you and I were seen
probing around at this time of night.

751
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:29,700
Look, I'll find them. I promise you I'll
find 'em if I have to tear this room apart.

752
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:38,600
- Thank you.
- Forget it.

753
01:08:38,700 --> 01:08:40,100
- Werner.
- Yes?

754
01:08:40,200 --> 01:08:42,500
There is one small favour.

755
01:08:42,800 --> 01:08:45,100
A camera.

756
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,700
We want to take some snapshots.
You know, keepsakes.

757
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,600
35mm with a 2.8 lens and a plane shutter.

758
01:08:54,900 --> 01:08:56,800
Focal-plane shutter.

759
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:01,700
Werner, that's a focal-plane shutter.

760
01:09:02,900 --> 01:09:04,700
Let me know when you got it.

761
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:13,800
He's a crazy, mixed-up kid,
that Werner, but I like him.

762
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:15,800
Checkmate.

763
01:09:38,900 --> 01:09:41,000
How soon's our air pump
going to be ready?

764
01:09:41,200 --> 01:09:44,400
- I'll have it for you tomorrow.
- You're badly behind schedule.

765
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,800
- How's it coming, Danny?
- No good.

766
01:09:46,900 --> 01:09:49,300
- No good?
- Today, three times.

767
01:10:06,300 --> 01:10:07,600
Willie, you all right?

768
01:10:07,700 --> 01:10:09,600
Pull!

769
01:10:37,200 --> 01:10:42,000
You're gonna have to shore up the whole
bloody tunnel, Roger. All 335 feet of it.

770
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,100
Four times today.

771
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:48,900
This way we never get through.
We must have more wood.

772
01:10:49,900 --> 01:10:53,100
It's a lot of timber, Roger. Can you get it?

773
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:58,700
We'll get it. We've gotta get it.

774
01:10:59,800 --> 01:11:03,300
I'll put Hendley on it,
and the new man we got this morning.

775
01:11:04,200 --> 01:11:05,300
OK, Willie.

776
01:11:05,700 --> 01:11:09,100
On the first day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

777
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:11,600
A partridge in a pear tree

778
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
On the second day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

779
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:18,500
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

780
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:22,000
On the fourth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

781
01:11:22,100 --> 01:11:24,300
Four calling birds, three French hens

782
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,100
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

783
01:11:28,200 --> 01:11:31,500
On the fifth day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

784
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:34,500
Five gold rings

785
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,600
- How's it going with the rafters up there?
- Taking out one in four.

786
01:11:45,300 --> 01:11:46,300
Stay with it.

787
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:49,400
Five gold rings

788
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:51,400
Four calling birds, three French hens

789
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:55,100
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

790
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:58,500
On the seventh day of Christmas
my true love sent to me

791
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:01,100
Seven swans a-swimming,
six geese a-laying

792
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:04,200
Five gold rings

793
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:06,300
Four calling birds, three French hens

794
01:12:06,500 --> 01:12:10,500
Two turtle doves
and a partridge in a pear tree

795
01:12:23,300 --> 01:12:26,100
Five gold rings, four calling birds...

796
01:12:26,300 --> 01:12:29,500
Bloody singing. I've never worked
so hard in all my life. Hi, Hilts.

797
01:12:29,700 --> 01:12:30,600
Say, Cavendish...

798
01:12:30,700 --> 01:12:32,700
Three French hens, two turtle doves

799
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,700
And a partridge in a pear...

800
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:36,700
Allez hup!

801
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,800
Never mind.

802
01:12:54,300 --> 01:12:56,900
Here's a present from our friend Werner.

803
01:12:57,100 --> 01:12:58,600
Splendid.

804
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:00,700
Simply splendid.

805
01:13:01,700 --> 01:13:03,800
This should do very nicely.

806
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:09,000
Those are Ashley-Pitt's men.

807
01:13:09,100 --> 01:13:13,100
He requested permission to dispose
of some of his dirt in our attic.

808
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:22,500
Tom has reached just beyond
that pile of wood, sir.

809
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:26,700
- Harry, of course, isn't as far as that.
- How much further to the trees?

810
01:14:26,900 --> 01:14:28,800
We make it 50 feet, sir.

811
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:32,100
- Dark of the moon is the 7th...
- 8th and 9th.

812
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:34,100
A day earlier in August.

813
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:41,800
Morning.

814
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:44,900
There he goes again.

815
01:14:45,000 --> 01:14:47,400
Why is he buying up all
the potatoes in the camp?

816
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:50,300
I've been working on that,
but I can't find out.

817
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:52,800
Hilts and Hendley
lock themselves in every night.

818
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:56,100
Sometimes Goff's with them.
Other nights he's on guard outside.

819
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:00,100
Mac, we'll close down Dick and Harry.
Seal them off.

820
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,900
Put the entire effort into Tom
and press on into the trees.

821
01:15:03,100 --> 01:15:04,500
Right, Roger.

822
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:51,900
Wow.

823
01:15:53,900 --> 01:15:55,400
Wow.

824
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,700
Wow.

825
01:16:24,100 --> 01:16:25,700
Wow.

826
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,500
Wow.

827
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:43,100
Wow.

828
01:17:31,700 --> 01:17:32,700
About face!

829
01:17:33,900 --> 01:17:35,800
Forward march!

830
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:46,400
- What is it?
- They're celebrating the revolution.

831
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,400
It's the 4th of July.

832
01:17:57,500 --> 01:17:59,300
What the devil's this?

833
01:18:05,000 --> 01:18:07,100
Gentlemen, you're invited for free drinks.

834
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:10,800
- A little present from the colonials.
- Down the British.

835
01:18:10,900 --> 01:18:13,300
- Quite right too.
- And a little drink to Tom.

836
01:18:13,400 --> 01:18:15,500
And to getting home.

837
01:18:15,600 --> 01:18:17,100
Very well. We accept.

838
01:18:17,200 --> 01:18:19,000
- Up the rebels!
- Down the British!

839
01:18:19,100 --> 01:18:20,500
Gentlemen, follow us.

840
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,500
About face!

841
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:43,200
Company, halt!

842
01:18:47,100 --> 01:18:49,400
All right, let's line up down here!

843
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,700
All right, grab a cup!

844
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:54,700
Line it up! Here we go.

845
01:19:01,500 --> 01:19:04,100
That explains what happened
to the potatoes.

846
01:19:04,200 --> 01:19:07,100
No harm in closing down Tom
for one day, Roger.

847
01:19:07,200 --> 01:19:09,900
I suppose it'll do us all good
to let off a bit of steam.

848
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:13,700
There's only 14 feet to go, sir, and you
can feel it throughout the whole camp.

849
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:16,700
- I think that calls for a drink.
- Hear, hear.

850
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,900
- Drink it up!
- What is this stuff, Hilts?

851
01:19:19,100 --> 01:19:22,200
Moonshine.
American moonshine. Moonshine.

852
01:19:22,300 --> 01:19:24,700
Make my moustache grow. Cheers.

853
01:19:24,900 --> 01:19:27,100
Keep it moving.

854
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:29,300
Hello, Eric. Don't spill any of that.

855
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,700
- There you go.
- Down with the British.

856
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:35,000
All right, old cobber. Keep it mo...

857
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,700
- Don't get any on your clothes.
- Cheers!

858
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:42,600
- Don't spill any of that.
- Before your morning tea?

859
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:44,800
Keep it moving.

860
01:19:44,900 --> 01:19:46,900
Don't get any on your clothes, sir.

861
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,300
American moonshine.
Don't smoke right after you drink it.

862
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:53,300
No smoking.
No smoking while you're drinking.

863
01:20:07,800 --> 01:20:09,700
Get good and stoned, my friend.

864
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,100
Keep it going. Keep it...

865
01:20:14,900 --> 01:20:18,200
No taxation without representation.

866
01:20:18,300 --> 01:20:20,700
Keep it going, boys. Keep it...

867
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:24,300
Keep it going, fellas. Enjoy yourselves.

868
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,800
Well, let's drink to Tom.

869
01:20:26,900 --> 01:20:28,800
To Tom.

870
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:39,500
In the three years, seven months
and two weeks that I've been in the bag,

871
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:42,500
that's the most extraordinary
stuff I've ever tasted.

872
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:45,800
- It's shattering.
- Well, I think it's rather good.

873
01:20:48,400 --> 01:20:51,800
Well, with your permission, sir,
I think I'll all on kive.

874
01:20:53,200 --> 01:20:55,100
Call on Ives.

875
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,100
Cheers, Hendley!

876
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,800
You know what that is?

877
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,100
I'll tell you what it isn't.

878
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:20,500
It isn't Napoleon brandy.

879
01:21:22,000 --> 01:21:23,800
How do you like it, sir?

880
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,700
Well, it's...

881
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,700
To the colonies.

882
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,700
Independence.

883
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:40,300
How are you managing over there without
us? Getting along all right, are you?

884
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:43,300
We seem to be getting along all right,
shir... sir.

885
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:53,500
Yes, well, it's...

886
01:21:54,800 --> 01:21:56,600
It's good stuff, Hilts.

887
01:21:58,900 --> 01:22:00,700
Thank you, sir.

888
01:22:20,200 --> 01:22:22,100
Danny! Here's to...

889
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:31,700
Roger, goons in 105.

890
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:34,500
- Who?
- Strachwitz.

891
01:22:37,500 --> 01:22:42,300
We have to ignore it. If we pay attention,
the goons'll know the hut's important.

892
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:45,100
Here's to going home.

893
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:02,700
Come on, Danny.
They've searched it a hundred times.

894
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,700
Home!

895
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:20,500
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you
in the tunnel with us. To Tom, eh?

896
01:23:23,100 --> 01:23:26,900
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down
Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.

897
01:23:27,000 --> 01:23:31,500
To Tom. You know, Sandy,
I'm just beginning to realise that myself.

898
01:23:31,700 --> 01:23:34,500
Why shouldn't you, man?
We're nearly at the trees, boy.

899
01:23:34,600 --> 01:23:36,500
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

900
01:24:22,100 --> 01:24:24,000
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

901
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:25,800
Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

902
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,000
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.

903
01:25:18,500 --> 01:25:20,300
It's the tunnel.

904
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:38,400
Success.

905
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,500
Ives!

906
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:14,700
Sir, let me know
the exact information you need.

907
01:27:15,800 --> 01:27:17,900
- I'm going out tonight.
- Right.

908
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:22,300
Open up Harry.

909
01:27:22,500 --> 01:27:25,000
We dig. Around the clock.

910
01:28:55,900 --> 01:28:58,100
- Cooler.
- Right.

911
01:29:01,500 --> 01:29:04,200
Well, I didn't think
they'd catch him so soon.

912
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:08,000
He wasn't caught.

913
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,200
Hilts, welcome home.

914
01:30:14,100 --> 01:30:15,200
Danny?

915
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,300
Danny?

916
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,900
Danny?

917
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:32,100
Are you all right, Danny?

918
01:30:33,800 --> 01:30:35,700
Yes.

919
01:30:35,800 --> 01:30:37,700
All right.

920
01:30:39,800 --> 01:30:42,700
All right. Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

921
01:30:45,200 --> 01:30:47,600
For God's sake,
you've left out a whole eagle.

922
01:30:47,700 --> 01:30:49,600
That's impossible.

923
01:30:50,700 --> 01:30:52,600
Yes.

924
01:30:53,300 --> 01:30:56,100
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

925
01:30:57,200 --> 01:30:59,200
I'm sorry, Colin.

926
01:30:59,300 --> 01:31:01,200
It's all right, Smithy.

927
01:31:02,300 --> 01:31:06,000
It's getting late.
You push off to bed. I'll pack up here.

928
01:31:06,100 --> 01:31:07,900
All right.

929
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,600
- Good night, Colin.
- Good night, Smithy.

930
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:51,500
I can't see a bloody thing.

931
01:32:18,500 --> 01:32:22,300
- Your German's very good.
- Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...

932
01:32:22,500 --> 01:32:26,700
Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip up
a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

933
01:32:26,800 --> 01:32:29,300
- I'm sorry, Mac.
- OK. But remember, German always.

934
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:46,100
One, two, three, four, five.

935
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:05,600
Roger.

936
01:33:10,600 --> 01:33:12,000
No, it's me.

937
01:33:14,300 --> 01:33:16,200
How do you like the old escape suit?

938
01:33:16,300 --> 01:33:18,200
Fine, fine.

939
01:33:20,500 --> 01:33:22,400
Colin.

940
01:33:24,500 --> 01:33:26,700
How do you like mine?

941
01:33:26,900 --> 01:33:29,100
It looks splendid.

942
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:56,600
Where are you going?
You'll get yourself shot.

943
01:33:56,800 --> 01:34:00,800
- What's the matter with you?
- I'm going out through that fence.

944
01:34:02,400 --> 01:34:05,800
Danny, we're getting out through
the tunnel. We're almost clear.

945
01:34:05,900 --> 01:34:08,600
Please, Willie, let me alone.

946
01:34:08,700 --> 01:34:11,200
I can't go in that tunnel any more.

947
01:34:11,300 --> 01:34:13,600
So I'm going out through the wire.

948
01:34:17,000 --> 01:34:20,600
Danny, think. We're getting out,
but not through the wire.

949
01:34:20,700 --> 01:34:23,600
We're getting out through the tunnel.
It's finished.

950
01:34:23,700 --> 01:34:25,900
- I go out now.
- No.

951
01:34:26,900 --> 01:34:30,100
Danny, you go through that wire
and you'll get killed.

952
01:34:37,100 --> 01:34:39,000
Don't do that.

953
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:43,000
Willie...

954
01:34:44,600 --> 01:34:46,700
Since I was a boy,

955
01:34:46,900 --> 01:34:51,100
I hate and feared little rooms,

956
01:34:51,200 --> 01:34:53,300
closets, caves.

957
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,700
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels.
Over 17 tunnels.

958
01:34:55,900 --> 01:34:58,100
Because I must get out.

959
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:01,200
I hide the fear, and I dig.

960
01:35:02,200 --> 01:35:06,000
But tomorrow night in the tunnel
with all those men,

961
01:35:06,200 --> 01:35:08,700
I'm afraid maybe this time
I will lose my head

962
01:35:08,800 --> 01:35:11,500
and ruin the escape for everybody.

963
01:35:14,200 --> 01:35:16,000
So I go now.

964
01:35:20,700 --> 01:35:23,500
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.

965
01:35:24,900 --> 01:35:28,300
I'll look after you.
I'll stick with you all the way.

966
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:31,500
All right.

967
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:41,300
- Good evening.
- Hello, Roger.

968
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,500
Well, how do you think we look?

969
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,800
It's as bad as all that?

970
01:35:49,900 --> 01:35:56,200
Colin, I want first of all to say that without
you, we would not have been ready.

971
01:35:56,300 --> 01:35:59,800
That's all right. I had lots of help.
Lots of very good help.

972
01:36:01,500 --> 01:36:03,300
What's the matter, Roger?

973
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:06,600
You can't go.

974
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:09,600
- What do you mean?
- I can't allow it.

975
01:36:09,700 --> 01:36:10,200
Why?

976
01:36:10,300 --> 01:36:13,000
You can't see your hand
in front of your face.

977
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:15,600
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.

978
01:36:15,700 --> 01:36:17,600
That's ridiculous.

979
01:36:18,600 --> 01:36:21,800
That's ridiculous. Never heard
anything so absurd in my life.

980
01:36:22,000 --> 01:36:25,200
I can see perfectly. I can see perfectly!

981
01:36:25,900 --> 01:36:29,200
I can see... that pin down there.

982
01:36:29,400 --> 01:36:31,900
- Does that satisfy you?
- What pin? Where?

983
01:36:43,200 --> 01:36:46,400
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?

984
01:36:47,600 --> 01:36:48,800
Yes, of course.

985
01:36:50,800 --> 01:36:53,800
Put the pin down there, will you?

986
01:36:53,900 --> 01:36:55,300
All right.

987
01:36:59,500 --> 01:37:00,900
All right. Come on.

988
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:03,700
Come on. Sit down.

989
01:37:05,200 --> 01:37:07,600
Sit down. It was a good try.

990
01:37:08,900 --> 01:37:12,700
I hate these last-minute letdowns,
but I've only just been told.

991
01:37:12,900 --> 01:37:16,200
- It's too risky for you.
- Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

992
01:37:16,400 --> 01:37:18,700
- No, I don't.
- Come on, Roger.

993
01:37:18,800 --> 01:37:24,000
We all know the score here.
Well, at least, most of us do.

994
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:27,200
Your idea of this escape
is to start another front,

995
01:37:27,300 --> 01:37:31,400
to foul up the Germans behind the lines.
All right, that's fine.

996
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,900
But once we get past that wire and have
them looking all over Germany for us,

997
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,300
that mission is accomplished.

998
01:37:38,400 --> 01:37:41,500
Afterwards, we have
some ideas of our own.

999
01:37:42,700 --> 01:37:44,400
You mean getting home?

1000
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,800
- Back to your family?
- That's right.

1001
01:37:46,900 --> 01:37:50,100
Do you really believe
I haven't thought about that too?

1002
01:37:50,300 --> 01:37:52,100
I'm sure you have.

1003
01:37:53,300 --> 01:37:55,200
I know Colin has.

1004
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,200
And, Roger, I have too.

1005
01:37:58,400 --> 01:38:00,200
We think we can make it all the way.

1006
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:04,900
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard
to the escape. That must be my decision.

1007
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:09,000
Let's talk about hazard.
Let's talk about you.

1008
01:38:09,100 --> 01:38:12,900
You're the biggest hazard we have.
The Gestapo has you marked.

1009
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:16,700
No one has said you can't go.

1010
01:38:18,100 --> 01:38:20,500
That's true.

1011
01:38:20,600 --> 01:38:22,900
I have thought about the Gestapo.

1012
01:38:24,900 --> 01:38:28,700
But if you're asking me how far
a commanding officer is allowed to go,

1013
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:30,700
or dare go,

1014
01:38:31,800 --> 01:38:34,100
or should be permitted to play God,

1015
01:38:35,400 --> 01:38:37,300
I can't answer you.

1016
01:38:38,600 --> 01:38:40,300
But I can tell you

1017
01:38:40,700 --> 01:38:44,200
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard
to himself and the whole plan,

1018
01:38:44,400 --> 01:38:47,200
and must therefore be
eliminated from the operation.

1019
01:38:57,900 --> 01:39:02,800
Colin's not a blind man as long
as he's with me, and he's going with me.

1020
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:10,800
It's all right with you, Colin?

1021
01:39:12,800 --> 01:39:15,300
Oh, yes. Quite.

1022
01:39:22,700 --> 01:39:28,200
Very well. I'll arrange for your escape
numbers to be altered accordingly.

1023
01:39:29,100 --> 01:39:31,000
Good night, gentlemen.

1024
01:39:37,500 --> 01:39:39,400
Actually...

1025
01:39:40,600 --> 01:39:42,700
he's quite right.

1026
01:39:42,900 --> 01:39:44,700
He's completely right.

1027
01:39:45,300 --> 01:39:47,300
I really shouldn't go at all.

1028
01:39:47,400 --> 01:39:50,600
My eyes have been getting
worse and worse lately.

1029
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:54,000
I think they call it progressive myopia.

1030
01:39:54,600 --> 01:39:57,500
I can see things up here. Close to.

1031
01:39:57,600 --> 01:40:00,000
I can see to work, but...

1032
01:40:02,800 --> 01:40:05,000
you're just a blur.

1033
01:40:05,100 --> 01:40:07,000
I know.

1034
01:40:07,800 --> 01:40:10,100
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.

1035
01:40:10,200 --> 01:40:12,400
Colin, do you have any tea?

1036
01:40:13,500 --> 01:40:16,000
- Yes, of course.
- Then let's have some.

1037
01:40:17,500 --> 01:40:19,400
Splendid.

1038
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,200
Hi, Hilts.

1039
01:41:05,300 --> 01:41:07,200
Hey, Mac.

1040
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:10,800
When?

1041
01:41:10,900 --> 01:41:13,400
Tonight. We thought
they'd never let you out.

1042
01:41:13,500 --> 01:41:15,900
Me, too. Let's get at it.

1043
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,700
- Bartlett's waiting for you.
- I'll be there.

1044
01:42:26,900 --> 01:42:28,100
What time?

1045
01:42:30,200 --> 01:42:32,200
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1046
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,100
You OK?

1047
01:42:47,800 --> 01:42:49,600
Cavendish.

1048
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:51,100
Griff, down there.

1049
01:42:51,300 --> 01:42:53,100
Goff, there.

1050
01:43:12,300 --> 01:43:15,200
Smith, Foles, third on the right.

1051
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:19,000
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.

1052
01:43:47,600 --> 01:43:49,000
There are the lights.

1053
01:43:50,700 --> 01:43:52,900
Right on the tick, Danny.

1054
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,900
Look down the tunnel, Danny. It's lovely.

1055
01:44:07,300 --> 01:44:10,700
It's just like Blackpool
at the height of the season.

1056
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:14,900
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

1057
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:16,600
Yes.

1058
01:44:16,800 --> 01:44:18,600
No.

1059
01:44:19,400 --> 01:44:21,300
I don't know.

1060
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:26,500
It's time, Roger.

1061
01:44:38,300 --> 01:44:41,600
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

1062
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:46,600
It's all clear, sir.

1063
01:44:55,000 --> 01:44:56,900
All set, Roger.

1064
01:45:08,900 --> 01:45:10,600
Roger.

1065
01:45:10,700 --> 01:45:12,600
Good luck.

1066
01:45:42,300 --> 01:45:44,700
They're coming down
the shaft now, Danny.

1067
01:45:44,800 --> 01:45:48,100
And then they'll be coming
right up the tunnel.

1068
01:45:54,000 --> 01:45:56,000
Willie...

1069
01:45:56,100 --> 01:45:59,100
I can't wait. I must get out.

1070
01:45:59,400 --> 01:46:02,900
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!

1071
01:46:29,700 --> 01:46:33,000
What is it, Danny? What's the matter?
Danny! Come here!

1072
01:46:33,600 --> 01:46:36,600
Roger? Danny and I'll go later.
We'll take another place.

1073
01:46:36,700 --> 01:46:39,600
Danny, tell me what this is
and tell me quickly!

1074
01:46:39,700 --> 01:46:43,500
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody.
I dug it. I built it.

1075
01:46:43,700 --> 01:46:45,900
I was buried many times.
I go when I want.

1076
01:46:46,000 --> 01:46:47,900
Let me out. Let me out.

1077
01:46:51,100 --> 01:46:53,300
Take him out, Willie. Take him out.

1078
01:47:07,700 --> 01:47:09,600
Danny? What is it?

1079
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,100
Danny, what's going on?

1080
01:47:12,200 --> 01:47:15,200
It's all right, Sedgwick.
It's all right. We're going later.

1081
01:47:21,600 --> 01:47:24,100
Danny, it's all right. It's all right.

1082
01:47:24,200 --> 01:47:27,900
We can take another place in the line.
It's all right.

1083
01:47:28,600 --> 01:47:30,500
All right, Colin. Down you go.

1084
01:47:31,200 --> 01:47:35,700
Sit down. Feel the top rung of
the ladder with your right foot. Got it?

1085
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:37,700
Down you go.

1086
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,300
Danny cut out, huh?

1087
01:47:54,500 --> 01:47:56,900
Willie took him up top. Hilts, l...

1088
01:48:09,600 --> 01:48:12,100
- Remember, keep your head down.
- Right.

1089
01:48:28,600 --> 01:48:30,400
Right.

1090
01:48:37,100 --> 01:48:38,900
Bartlett.

1091
01:49:15,500 --> 01:49:17,500
All right?

1092
01:49:17,700 --> 01:49:21,300
- Hold on to yourself. You're 20 feet short.
- What do you mean?

1093
01:49:21,400 --> 01:49:24,100
20 feet short of the woods.
The hole is in the open.

1094
01:49:24,200 --> 01:49:26,500
The guard is between us and the lights.

1095
01:49:26,600 --> 01:49:28,400
How could that happen?

1096
01:49:28,500 --> 01:49:31,900
What the hell difference does it make?
It's happened.

1097
01:49:45,400 --> 01:49:48,000
- Roger...
- Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!

1098
01:49:48,900 --> 01:49:50,700
We could postpone it.

1099
01:49:50,900 --> 01:49:54,000
All the documents are dated today.
It's now or never.

1100
01:49:57,900 --> 01:50:02,500
One chance. When the guard goes to the
far end, you might be able to move out.

1101
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:06,500
I think I can make it to the woods,
set up a signal when you're clear.

1102
01:50:06,700 --> 01:50:07,700
What about the towers?

1103
01:50:07,900 --> 01:50:11,200
They're gonna be watching
the compound, not the woods.

1104
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:17,900
Mac, pass the word.
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1105
01:50:18,600 --> 01:50:20,300
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1106
01:50:22,000 --> 01:50:24,400
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1107
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:28,000
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1108
01:50:28,200 --> 01:50:29,700
- What?
- 30 feet of rope!

1109
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:33,300
- What do they want that for?
- How should I know? Get the rope.

1110
01:50:47,700 --> 01:50:51,900
- How's it going? Have you heard?
- Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

1111
01:50:52,100 --> 01:50:55,800
- Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet?
- I don't think so, sir.

1112
01:51:17,400 --> 01:51:19,300
He's over there.

1113
01:51:25,100 --> 01:51:26,900
Right. You go first, Eric.

1114
01:51:28,200 --> 01:51:30,500
I'm staying here till we get moving.

1115
01:51:41,300 --> 01:51:43,500
- See you in Piccadilly.
- Scott's Bar.

1116
01:51:43,600 --> 01:51:45,200
Right.

1117
01:51:57,500 --> 01:51:58,800
Thank you.

1118
01:51:58,900 --> 01:52:00,800
- Good luck.
- Right.

1119
01:52:24,600 --> 01:52:26,500
We're moving.

1120
01:52:32,800 --> 01:52:36,900
Danny, they're moving through
the tunnel now. They're getting out.

1121
01:52:39,400 --> 01:52:44,600
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and
came to England because you're a flier.

1122
01:52:44,700 --> 01:52:48,900
You came because you wanted to fly
with us and fight the Germans.

1123
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:51,800
We can get out now.
We can get back to England.

1124
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,600
If you don't go through that tunnel,

1125
01:52:55,700 --> 01:52:59,600
everything you've done
will have been for nothing - nothing!

1126
01:53:26,800 --> 01:53:28,700
- Blythe's behind, Mac.
- Right.

1127
01:53:31,300 --> 01:53:33,200
In here, Colin.

1128
01:53:33,700 --> 01:53:35,600
Sit down.

1129
01:53:40,200 --> 01:53:42,400
You're up, Sedgwick. I'll take over.

1130
01:53:45,800 --> 01:53:49,000
- What have you got in here? A piano?
- That's very funny, mate.

1131
01:53:49,100 --> 01:53:51,800
- You won't get this thing through.
- I'll cope.

1132
01:53:55,400 --> 01:53:58,400
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk?
- Who else?

1133
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,500
I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1134
01:54:07,100 --> 01:54:10,300
- We're 20 feet short.
- How the hell...?

1135
01:54:10,400 --> 01:54:12,700
Hilts is on the other end
of that rope in the woods.

1136
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:17,300
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs,
off you go, but keep Colin low.

1137
01:54:18,300 --> 01:54:20,200
- Good luck, Colin.
- Thanks, Mac.

1138
01:54:29,900 --> 01:54:31,800
What's that?

1139
01:54:32,600 --> 01:54:35,200
- It's an air raid.
- Oh, God! No!

1140
01:54:35,300 --> 01:54:38,700
The goons'll pull the switches.
We'll lose the lights in the tunnel.

1141
01:54:38,800 --> 01:54:42,000
Come on, Colin. We can get out
when the lights go down.

1142
01:54:54,100 --> 01:54:55,500
Willie.

1143
01:54:56,200 --> 01:54:57,100
Willie!

1144
01:54:59,100 --> 01:55:02,000
It's an air raid.
Searchlights are out. Come on!

1145
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:10,000
Get 'em out.

1146
01:55:15,100 --> 01:55:17,000
- It's gonna give!
- Danny.

1147
01:55:17,100 --> 01:55:20,400
Danny. Danny, it's all right.
Danny, it's the lights.

1148
01:55:22,300 --> 01:55:25,400
Light the lamps down there!

1149
01:55:25,900 --> 01:55:28,500
There's been an air raid
and they've cut the lights.

1150
01:55:28,600 --> 01:55:31,500
Danny, it's all right. Listen to me!

1151
01:55:32,900 --> 01:55:34,700
Danny, look.

1152
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:42,400
Come on, fellas. Move! Move!
We can get dozens out in this darkness.

1153
01:55:48,900 --> 01:55:51,000
What the hell's going on?

1154
01:55:51,100 --> 01:55:53,800
- You go.
- No. Danny.

1155
01:55:55,600 --> 01:55:57,500
Go.

1156
01:56:04,600 --> 01:56:06,600
- What is this, Willie?
- Danny.

1157
01:56:06,700 --> 01:56:08,800
- Is he stuck in there?
- He's all right.

1158
01:56:08,900 --> 01:56:10,900
Get him out fast.

1159
01:56:13,400 --> 01:56:15,200
Come on.

1160
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,400
Come on, Danny, move.

1161
01:56:34,900 --> 01:56:36,800
Up you go.

1162
01:56:42,600 --> 01:56:44,400
Give me your bag.

1163
01:56:50,900 --> 01:56:52,800
We're on the rope!

1164
01:57:36,000 --> 01:57:39,300
You and I had better get out, or we won't
have a chance of any of the trains.

1165
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:43,600
It's moving. We'll just have to pass
the instructions from man to man.

1166
01:57:44,400 --> 01:57:46,100
- Right.
- I'll be right behind you.

1167
01:58:31,100 --> 01:58:33,300
Come on, come on.

1168
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:52,400
Come on.

1169
01:59:10,200 --> 01:59:11,700
- Hey!
- Don't shoot!

1170
01:59:12,500 --> 01:59:14,400
Don't shoot!

1171
01:59:15,100 --> 01:59:16,900
Don't shoot!

1172
01:59:20,900 --> 01:59:22,900
Get off! We're coming back!

1173
01:59:45,200 --> 01:59:48,200
Oh, boy. There's a hell of a lot
of shooting going on up there.

1174
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:50,900
Think they've been shooting them
as they came out?

1175
01:59:51,100 --> 01:59:53,300
We would've heard the shots before.

1176
01:59:55,700 --> 01:59:56,700
Pull!

1177
01:59:56,900 --> 01:59:58,700
Wait for me.

1178
02:00:04,000 --> 02:00:05,900
Out.

1179
02:00:26,000 --> 02:00:27,100
Out.

1180
02:01:00,100 --> 02:01:02,000
- How many did he say?
- 76.

1181
02:01:02,200 --> 02:01:03,400
76.

1182
02:01:03,600 --> 02:01:05,100
- 76.
- 76.

1183
02:01:18,900 --> 02:01:20,800
- Dismissed.
- Ten hut!

1184
02:02:15,400 --> 02:02:18,500
Half the guys who missed
their trains are piled up here.

1185
02:02:18,600 --> 02:02:21,700
Ashley-Pitt, Roger, MacDonald, Nimmo.

1186
02:02:21,800 --> 02:02:23,600
Makes quite a group.

1187
02:02:23,700 --> 02:02:27,200
- What do we do?
- Wait for the train.

1188
02:08:17,100 --> 02:08:18,900
Tallyho.

1189
02:09:00,100 --> 02:09:01,900
Tallyho.

1190
02:09:33,500 --> 02:09:37,100
- Are the police on the train?
- The Gestapo are with them. Let's jump.

1191
02:09:37,300 --> 02:09:39,100
All right.

1192
02:09:43,500 --> 02:09:47,600
- I'll tell you when.
- I'd prefer you just to give me a firm push.

1193
02:10:06,300 --> 02:10:09,200
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.

1194
02:10:09,300 --> 02:10:11,500
That's quite exciting.

1195
02:10:13,000 --> 02:10:15,800
- It isn't stopping.
- No, we're all right.

1196
02:11:09,500 --> 02:11:11,300
Switzerland.

1197
02:11:43,200 --> 02:11:44,300
Hey!

1198
02:15:42,300 --> 02:15:43,100
Bartlett.

1199
02:16:40,100 --> 02:16:44,800
- Where were you going, Cavendish?
- I... I hadn't quite decided.

1200
02:16:44,900 --> 02:16:47,600
What information were you
to collect on the way?

1201
02:16:47,700 --> 02:16:48,500
None.

1202
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:51,200
What sabotage directions
did you receive?

1203
02:16:51,300 --> 02:16:53,600
What have you done with your papers?

1204
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:58,400
- Papers?
- Forged papers and identity cards.

1205
02:16:58,500 --> 02:17:01,700
Don't be so stupid.
What did you do with them?

1206
02:17:01,800 --> 02:17:03,700
All I did was escape from a prison camp.

1207
02:17:03,900 --> 02:17:07,400
You'd do the same if you'd been
locked up for three years.

1208
02:17:07,900 --> 02:17:11,500
- I wanted to get home.
- I don't think you'll see your wife again.

1209
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:13,900
You've got the wrong man.
I'm not even married.

1210
02:17:14,100 --> 02:17:16,200
You're wearing civilian clothes.

1211
02:17:17,600 --> 02:17:20,900
You're a spy. Spies are being shot.

1212
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:24,800
This is my uniform.
I had to recut it when I lost weight.

1213
02:17:26,400 --> 02:17:29,000
I dyed it with boot polish
to cover some oil smears

1214
02:17:29,200 --> 02:17:31,300
I picked up when I was shot down.

1215
02:17:41,500 --> 02:17:44,300
And you lost your insignia
over the years?

1216
02:17:44,400 --> 02:17:46,300
That's right.

1217
02:17:51,200 --> 02:17:53,400
- Look...
- That's all, Cavendish.

1218
02:18:17,100 --> 02:18:18,900
Hello, boys.

1219
02:18:22,700 --> 02:18:24,600
Hello.

1220
02:18:26,800 --> 02:18:29,000
- Hello, Haynes.
- Hello, Cavendish.

1221
02:18:30,500 --> 02:18:32,900
I wish I could say I was happy
to see you again.

1222
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,600
- Just picked up?
- Yes, this morning.

1223
02:18:52,600 --> 02:18:55,000
There's a trainer out there I can fly.

1224
02:18:55,100 --> 02:18:57,700
- Any sentries?
- Yeah, it's gonna be a problem.

1225
02:20:02,900 --> 02:20:07,400
Colin, when I say go,
crank this clockwise.

1226
02:20:08,000 --> 02:20:12,600
When the engine catches, don't move,
or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.

1227
02:20:25,400 --> 02:20:26,400
Go!

1228
02:21:14,700 --> 02:21:16,600
Next stop, Switzerland!

1229
02:22:35,600 --> 02:22:37,600
The Alps.

1230
02:22:37,700 --> 02:22:39,000
Splendid.

1231
02:22:50,200 --> 02:22:54,400
Over this range, then 20 more minutes
and we've got it made.

1232
02:23:20,200 --> 02:23:24,000
- What is it? Petrol?
- I don't know. We're losing power.

1233
02:23:48,400 --> 02:23:50,800
Go that way! I'll follow.

1234
02:24:14,400 --> 02:24:15,400
Hendley?

1235
02:24:20,100 --> 02:24:21,900
Colin!

1236
02:24:25,700 --> 02:24:27,900
Stop! Don't shoot! Please!

1237
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:36,000
Colin, I'm sorry I fouled things up.

1238
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:39,100
That's all right.

1239
02:24:40,100 --> 02:24:41,900
Thank you for...

1240
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:45,700
getting me out.

1241
02:27:40,700 --> 02:27:42,500
Caf Suzette.

1242
02:28:14,600 --> 02:28:16,500
Hello?

1243
02:28:17,100 --> 02:28:19,000
Hello?

1244
02:28:54,400 --> 02:28:55,800
Resistance.

1245
02:28:55,900 --> 02:28:57,700
Resistance?

1246
02:28:58,300 --> 02:29:00,100
You are English?

1247
02:29:00,800 --> 02:29:02,600
I'm Australian.

1248
02:29:03,500 --> 02:29:08,000
- You can speak English. I understand.
- Bloody good. I'm a British officer.

1249
02:29:08,100 --> 02:29:11,300
I've just escaped from
a prisoner-of-war camp in Germany.

1250
02:29:11,400 --> 02:29:15,200
I'm trying to make my way into Spain.
You understand me?

1251
02:29:15,300 --> 02:29:17,200
Can you help me?

1252
02:29:20,700 --> 02:29:23,000
- I know someone who can.
- Bloody good.

1253
02:30:05,700 --> 02:30:06,900
Good luck.

1254
02:30:07,000 --> 02:30:08,500
Thank you.

1255
02:31:56,900 --> 02:31:58,500
You are English.

1256
02:32:38,300 --> 02:32:40,200
Herr Bartlett?

1257
02:32:47,400 --> 02:32:49,200
Your German is good.

1258
02:32:49,800 --> 02:32:52,000
And I hear also your French.

1259
02:32:53,800 --> 02:32:56,600
Your arms... up!

1260
02:33:31,400 --> 02:33:33,300
Herr Bartlett.

1261
02:33:33,800 --> 02:33:36,100
And Herr MacDonald.

1262
02:33:38,800 --> 02:33:40,900
We are together again.

1263
02:33:41,400 --> 02:33:45,200
You are going to wish
you had never put us to so much trouble.

1264
02:34:00,600 --> 02:34:04,100
- What's troubling you, Roger?
- I'm just a little surprised.

1265
02:34:04,200 --> 02:34:07,500
I expected either a long stay
or a very short trip.

1266
02:34:07,600 --> 02:34:09,500
Yes.

1267
02:34:09,600 --> 02:34:11,900
I have to admit,
I'm a little worried, though.

1268
02:34:12,100 --> 02:34:14,500
I hope to God I haven't
blotted 70-odd ledgers.

1269
02:34:14,700 --> 02:34:16,800
Och, no, no.

1270
02:34:16,900 --> 02:34:20,400
We're all over 21 ,
footloose and fancy-free.

1271
02:34:20,600 --> 02:34:23,300
We'd never have got as far
as we did without you, Roger.

1272
02:34:23,500 --> 02:34:27,300
For what it's worth,
I think you did a damn good job.

1273
02:34:27,400 --> 02:34:29,900
- I think we all do.
- Yes.

1274
02:35:08,100 --> 02:35:11,700
All right. You can get out now.
Stretch your legs for five minutes.

1275
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:15,100
It will take hours
before you reach the camp.

1276
02:35:35,400 --> 02:35:41,000
You know, Mac, all this - the organisation,
tunnelling, Tom and Harry -

1277
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:43,500
kept me alive.

1278
02:35:43,700 --> 02:35:45,500
And even though we...

1279
02:35:46,900 --> 02:35:49,100
I've never been happier.

1280
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:51,900
You know, Mac...

1281
02:36:30,600 --> 02:36:33,600
1 1 of your men are being returned today.

1282
02:36:33,700 --> 02:36:35,100
Oh, who?

1283
02:36:35,300 --> 02:36:37,300
I do not have that information.

1284
02:36:37,700 --> 02:36:39,600
I...

1285
02:36:40,200 --> 02:36:44,600
I am directed by a higher authority
to inform you that...

1286
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:49,200
50 of your officers
were shot while escaping.

1287
02:36:50,500 --> 02:36:51,700
Shot?

1288
02:36:52,800 --> 02:36:56,400
Their... personal effects will be returned.

1289
02:36:59,600 --> 02:37:02,100
How many of them were wounded?

1290
02:37:02,800 --> 02:37:05,800
Here are the names... of the dead.

1291
02:37:09,500 --> 02:37:12,000
How many of the 50 were wounded?

1292
02:37:13,200 --> 02:37:15,000
None.

1293
02:37:15,500 --> 02:37:17,800
They - the higher authority -

1294
02:37:18,800 --> 02:37:21,300
only directs me to inform you that...

1295
02:37:24,100 --> 02:37:26,000
that 50 men were...

1296
02:37:31,800 --> 02:37:32,800
I see.

1297
02:37:34,900 --> 02:37:36,900
Addison, John.

1298
02:37:37,000 --> 02:37:38,800
Alladale, Peter.

1299
02:37:38,900 --> 02:37:40,900
Bancroft, Edward.

1300
02:37:41,000 --> 02:37:43,100
Bartlett, Roger.

1301
02:37:43,200 --> 02:37:45,000
Cavendish, Dennis.

1302
02:37:45,300 --> 02:37:47,200
Eldridge, David.

1303
02:37:47,900 --> 02:37:49,800
Felton, William.

1304
02:37:50,800 --> 02:37:52,600
Fanshaw, Arthur.

1305
02:39:13,400 --> 02:39:15,300
I am your guide, se?or.

1306
02:39:15,400 --> 02:39:17,400
Spain?

1307
02:39:38,000 --> 02:39:40,500
- Glad to see you're all safe.
- Thank you, sir.

1308
02:39:40,600 --> 02:39:43,000
- How many have been brought back?
- You're the first.

1309
02:39:43,200 --> 02:39:46,200
- Do you know how many got away?
- Not yet.

1310
02:39:46,300 --> 02:39:48,900
What happened to Blythe?

1311
02:39:49,000 --> 02:39:51,200
He didn't make it, sir.

1312
02:39:51,300 --> 02:39:53,500
Roger was right about that.

1313
02:39:54,300 --> 02:39:57,100
I'm afraid Roger didn't make it, either.

1314
02:39:59,300 --> 02:40:03,100
I've just posted the list. They shot... 50.

1315
02:40:03,700 --> 02:40:05,600
The Gestapo murdered them.

1316
02:40:06,800 --> 02:40:08,200
50?

1317
02:40:08,400 --> 02:40:10,300
MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt?

1318
02:40:10,800 --> 02:40:11,700
Yes.

1319
02:40:11,900 --> 02:40:13,200
Danny and Willie?

1320
02:40:13,300 --> 02:40:15,100
No, they're not on the list.

1321
02:40:15,600 --> 02:40:17,500
- Haynes?
- Yes.

1322
02:40:19,700 --> 02:40:20,900
I'm sorry.

1323
02:40:22,800 --> 02:40:26,100
Roger's idea was to get back at
the enemy the hardest way he could.

1324
02:40:26,300 --> 02:40:28,500
Mess up the works.

1325
02:40:28,600 --> 02:40:31,700
From what we've heard here,
I think he did exactly that.

1326
02:40:32,200 --> 02:40:34,200
Do you think it was worth the price?

1327
02:40:35,300 --> 02:40:37,700
That depends on your
point of view, Hendley.

1328
02:40:40,700 --> 02:40:42,600
Yes, sir.

1329
02:41:29,900 --> 02:41:33,700
He is not to be saluted.
He's no longer in command.

1330
02:41:41,100 --> 02:41:43,400
The job just didn't work out, huh?

1331
02:41:43,500 --> 02:41:46,800
- You were lucky, Hilts.
- Lucky? Because I didn't...

1332
02:41:49,200 --> 02:41:50,800
How many?

1333
02:41:51,000 --> 02:41:52,800
50.

1334
02:41:53,900 --> 02:41:59,000
It looks, after all, as if
you will see Berlin before I do.

1335
02:42:49,400 --> 02:42:51,200
Sir.

1336
02:42:57,800 --> 02:42:59,100
Hey, Hilts!

1337
02:43:00,100 --> 02:43:10,100
