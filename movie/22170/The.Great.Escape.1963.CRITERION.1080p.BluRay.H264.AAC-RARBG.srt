Ja vas lublu
Я вас люблю.

134
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:48,820
-是什么意思？ -我爱你
- What's it mean? - I love you.

135
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:51,380
我爱你？那有什么用？
I love you? What bloody good is that?

136
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:54,120
我不知道 我自己也不打算用
I don't know. I wasn't going to use it myself.

137
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,760
立正
Halt!

138
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,980
出去
Out.

139

你们是朋友吗？-是同志
- Your friend, yes? - Товарищ.

141
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:29,620
威林斯基上尉 谁来担保你呢？
And who vouches for you, Lieutenant Willinski?

142
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,660
塞奇威克 滚出去
Get out, Sedgwick.

143
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:41,710
谢谢
Спасибо.

144
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
行军
Marsch!

145
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:10,670
等一下 等一下！
Hold it, hold it!

146
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:16,650
-你姓什么？ -艾弗斯
- Your name? - Ives.

147
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,370
艾弗斯
Ives. Ives.

148
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:23,480
艾弗斯 对了 苏格兰人
Oh, yes. Archibald Ives. Scots.

149
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,050
你比相片好看多了
The photograph doesn't do you justice.

150
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,680
看看你们处于类似情况时的模样
I'd like to see one of you under similar circumstances.

151
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:57,280
我现在不采取行动
I will not take action against you now.

152
00:18:57,290 --> 00:19:02,420
这是第一天 出现了很多愚蠢和大意的事
This is the first day here, and there has been much stupidity and carelessness...

153
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,560
双方都有
on both sides.

154
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:24,050
嘿！回来！
' Hey! Get out!

155
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:27,920
不要开枪！
Nicht schieBen! Nicht schieBen!

156
00:19:27,920 --> 00:19:29,910
不要开枪！
Don't shoot!

157
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,120
笨蛋！越线就死定了！
You fool! To cross the wire is death!

158
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,990
-什么线？ -这条线！警告线！
- What wire? - This wire! The warning wire!

159
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:39,060
是吗
Oh.

160
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,030
绝对不准越过这条线 你是知道的
It's absolutely forbidden to cross it. You know that.

161
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:45,530
我的棒球滚到那边去了 该怎样拿回来？
But my baseball rolled over there. How am I gonna get my baseball?

162
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:48,700
-你应该先请求准许 -好吧
- You first ask permission. - Oh, OK.

163
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:54,650
-我要捡棒球 -停止！立刻回到线这边！
Gettin' my baseball. - Stop this! Get over the wire immediately!

164
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:56,720
-好 -站住别动！
- OK. - You stay there!

165
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:59,120
让路 让路
Out of the way. Out.

166
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,680
你在铁丝网旁边做什么？
What are you doing over here by the wire?

167
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:09,090
我跟麦克斯说过 我要捡…
Like I told Max, I was trying to get my...

168
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:23,680
-你在铁丝网旁边做什么？ -我跟麦克斯说过…
- What were you doing by the wire? - Well, like I told Max...

169
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:28,180
我想逃出去 所以试图剪断铁丝网
I was trying to cut my way through your wire, because I wanna get out.

170
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:30,290
搜他的身
Durchsuchen Sie ihn.

171
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,720
你会说德语吗？-是的上校
- Do you speak German? - Jawohl, Herr Oberst.

172
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,860
剪线器？-是的上校
- Wire cutters. - Jawohl, Herr Oberst.

173
00:20:42,370 --> 00:20:46,860
我很高兴在这场战争中认识好几位英国军官
I have had the pleasure of knowing quite a number of British officers in this war.

174
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,310
让我感到高兴的是 双方互相理解
And I flatter myself that we understand one another.

175
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:59,650
希尔兹  你是我遇到的首位美国军官 对吗？
You are the first American officer I have met. Hilts, isn't it?

176
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:01,650
请叫我希尔兹上尉
Captain Hilts, actually.

177
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,620
-17次企图逃脱 -是18次
- Seventeen escape attempts. - Eighteen, sir.

178
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,750
-地道专家 工程师 -飞行员
- Tunnel man, engineer. - Flier.

179
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:11,230
我猜就是美国军方说的红牌飞行员
I suppose what's called in the American army a "hotshot pilot."

180
00:21:11,300 --> 00:21:13,820
不幸的是 你被击落了
Unfortunately, you were shot down anyway.

181
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,770
战争期间你我都停飞了
So we are both grounded for the duration of the war.

182
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:19,200
上校 你说的是你自己
Well, you speak for yourself, Colonel.

183
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:27,010
-你有别的计划？ -我还没从空中或地上看过柏林
- You have other plans? - I haven't seen Berlin yet.

184
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,070
我计划在战争结束以前去看看
I plan on doing so before the war's over.

185
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,810
美国军官都像你这样没礼貌？
Are all American officers so ill-mannered?

186
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:36,690
大约九成九是这样
About 99 percent.

187
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:40,020
或许和我们一起的时候 你可以学一点礼貌
Perhaps while you are with us, you will have a chance to learn some.

188
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,790
希尔兹 关禁闭十天
Ten days isolation, Hilts.

189
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:45,630
叫我希尔兹上尉 -关20天
- Captain Hilts. - Twenty days.

190
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,100
关就关
Right.

191
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:51,190
我出来的时候 你还会在这里吗？
Oh, you'll still be here when I get out?

192
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,110
禁闭室
Cooler.

193
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:04,720
-姓氏？ -艾弗斯
- Name? - Ives.

194
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:06,690
艾弗斯中尉
Flying Officer Ives.

195
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:08,720
禁闭20天
Cooler, 20 days.

196
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,260
艾弗斯 去禁闭室 -是我的荣幸
- Cooler, Ives. - Pleasure.

197
00:23:53,040 --> 00:23:55,430
-希尔兹 -什么事？
- Hilts. - Yeah?

198
00:23:55,570 --> 00:23:58,230
你在美国做什么？打棒球吗？
What did you do in the States? Play baseball?

199
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:00,830
不是 我是大学生
No, I was in college.

200
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:03,940
-艾弗斯 -什么事？
- Say, Ives. - Aye?

201
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:08,180
-你试过几次逃脱？ -地面四次 地下七次
- How many escapes have you tried? - Four over, seven under.

202
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:13,560
-地道专家 是吗？ -不敢当
- Tunnel man, huh? - Sure, I am that.

203
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:17,790
艾弗斯 你有多高？
How tall are you, Ives?

204
00:24:17,930 --> 00:24:19,660
162公分 干嘛？
Five feet four. Why?

205
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,430
只是问问
Oh, just wondering.

206
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:27,530
你在大学念什么？学体育吗？
What did you do in college? Study physical education?

207
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:30,610
学化工 但是爱骑车
Chemical engineering. Did a little bike riding, though.

208
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,200
骑脚踏车？
- Bicycles? - Motorcycles.

209
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:38,280
骑摩托车 赛车 表演会 到处赚一点小钱
Flat tracks, county fairs. Picked up a buck here and there.

210
00:24:38,350 --> 00:24:42,010
-帮助缴学费 -我也参加过比赛
- Helped pay my tuition. - I did a wee bit of racing myself.

211
00:24:42,090 --> 00:24:44,080
-在苏格兰 -摩托车？
- In Scotland. - Bikes?

212
00:24:44,590 --> 00:24:47,610
不 是赛马 我是骑师
No, horse racing. Jockey.

213
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,630
骑师
Jockey.

214
00:24:54,830 --> 00:24:55,800
骑师
Jockey.

215
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,600
希尔兹？
Hilts?

216
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:04,930
希尔兹 你还在听吗？
Are you there, Hilts?

217
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:08,370
我在听
Yeah, I'm here.

218
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:11,250
难道美国没有骑师吗？
Don't you have them in the States? Jockeys?

219
00:25:12,390 --> 00:25:13,980
当然有
- Sure. - They were the days.

220
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:19,620
那些日子真好 在马瑟堡和汉弥顿的周六夜
Saturday nights in towns like Musselburgh and Hamilton.

221
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:22,690
妞儿直往你身上挤
You had to fight off the birds.

222
00:25:22,730 --> 00:25:24,790
知道吗 妞儿耶
You know, birds.

223
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,870
女孩子 老兄 就是女孩子
Girls, man. Girls.

224
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,900
难道美国没有女孩子吗？
Do you not have them in the States?

225
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,230
希尔兹？
Hilts? Are you there, Hilts?

226
00:25:34,310 --> 00:25:36,300
希尔兹 你还在听吗？

227
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:38,810
艾弗斯
Ives.

228
00:25:41,650 --> 00:25:43,620
什么事？
What?

229
00:25:43,650 --> 00:25:48,320
你懂得营地里的黏土和碎石吗？
You know the kind of clay and gravel we got here in the compound?

230
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:51,450
你认为八小时之内能够挖多少尺？
How many feet do you think you could get through in eight hours?

231
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:56,090
我可以像钻头一样轻易挖穿这里的土
I could go through this dirt here like the bit on an end of an auger.

232
00:25:56,770 --> 00:26:00,220
但是挖土并不难 用木头支撑地道
But you know it's not the digging. It's the shoring up with wood,

233
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:03,600
还要把土运出来 那才是难题
and getting the dirt out, that's what you've to worry about.

234
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:06,570
不 艾弗斯 你不需要担心
No, it isn't, Ives. You don't have to worry about that.

235
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:09,040
你怎么把土运出来呢？
How are you going to get the dirt out?

236
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:13,110
你们在苏格兰怎么称呼地鼠？ -就叫地鼠
- What do they call a mole in Scotland? - A mole.

237
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,180
原来如此
Aye.

238
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,420
你认为怎样？
Well, what do you think?

239
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:24,080
最初20分钟很有意思
I must say, it's an interesting first 20 minutes.

240
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:26,150
我认为我们出了洋相
I'd say we made fools of ourselves.

241
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:29,960
就像那个士官说的 这只是第一天
As the sergeant out there says, this is only the first day.

242
00:26:47,050 --> 00:26:49,040
艾利克
Eric.

243
00:26:49,550 --> 00:26:53,390
不要引起太多注意 警卫可能不知道他是谁
Don't take too much notice. The goons may not know who he is.

244
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:56,390
-我去传话 -我去告诉老头子
- I'll pass the word. - I'll tell the old man.

245
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:00,720
他到了
He has arrived.

246
00:27:08,010 --> 00:27:12,670
鲁格上校 战俘巴特利交给你看管
The prisoner Bartlett is discharged into your custody, Colonel Von Luger.

247
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,380
我建议把这个战俘
I suggest this prisoner be kept

248
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:28,150
永久关在警卫最严密的地方
under the strictest security confinement permanently.

249
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,890
记录库恩先生的建议
Make a note of Herr Kuhn's suggestion.

250
00:27:32,030 --> 00:27:33,290
我们有理由相信
We have reason to believe he is the leader

251
00:27:33,300 --> 00:27:37,460
他是多次脱逃企图的领导人
of numerous criminal escape attempts.

252
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:42,710
你们看管了巴特利三个月
Squadron Leader Bartlett has been three months in your care,

253
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:46,180
但是秘密警察只是“有理由相信”吗？
and the Gestapo has only "reason to believe"?

254
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,440
如果他再次落入我们手里 就不会这么幸运了
If he once more falls into our hands, he will not be so lucky.

255
00:27:50,550 --> 00:27:55,110
空军军官战俘是由德国空军看管
Air-force officer prisoners are the responsibility of the Luftwaffe,

256
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,990
不是由党军看管
not the SS...

257
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:01,290
也不是由秘密警察看管
or the Gestapo.

258
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:03,600
上校先生 目前是这样
At present, yes, Herr Oberst.

259
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,260
所以他暂时归你看管
That is why he is returned, for the moment, to your care.

260
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:10,200
当然 如果空军没有能力
Of course, if the Luftwaffe is not up to the task,

261
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:13,460
就由我们全权处置战俘
the prisoners will find themselves totally in our charge.

262
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:17,440
我们就不是那么体谅
We regretfully are not so professionally understanding.

263
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,120
巴特利少校
Squadron Leader Bartlett,

264
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:29,150
如果你再次逃脱被抓到 就会被枪毙
if you escape again and be caught, you will be shot.

265
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,190
希特勒万岁 -希特勒万岁
- Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler.

266
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:34,440
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

267
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,030
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

268
00:28:43,770 --> 00:28:45,740
库恩先生
Herr Kuhn.

269
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,690
拿掉他的东西
ehmen Sie dem Mann diese Dinger ab.

270
00:29:27,950 --> 00:29:29,720
-艾利克 -你好 罗杰
- Eric. - Hello, Roger.

271
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,390
-他们把你也扔到这里来了 -这里情况如何？
- They dumped you here, too. - What's this one like?

272
00:29:32,390 --> 00:29:34,380
这里是新的战俘营
Well, it's new.

273
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:40,350
-给你找一个床位 -谢谢
- Here. Let's find you a bed. - Thanks.

274
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:57,950
请进
Come in.

275
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,070
-你好 罗杰 -你好 长官
- Hello, Roger. - Hello, sir.

276
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,860
-我把行李放在你房里 -艾利克 谢谢
- I'll put your bag in your room. - Thanks, Eric.

277
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,830
-你好吗？ -马马虎虎
- How are you? - As well as can be expected.

278
00:30:09,900 --> 00:30:13,460
弟兄们想为你办欢迎会 但是稍后再谈
The fellows wanted to put up a welcome committee, but that's for later.

279
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:17,980
-我看到威利 威林斯基和麦克 -这里有很多老朋友
- I saw Willie and Willinski with Mac. - A lot of old friends here.

280
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,870
-你来这里多久了？ -今天来的
- How long have you been here, sir? - Arrived today.

281
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,670
新营地 优秀的警卫 精英
New camp, expert guards, the elite.

282
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,750
你见过指挥官吗？
You met the commandant?

283
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,710
我见过
Yes, I did.

284
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:32,880
秘密警察和党军找你有什么事？
What were the Gestapo and the SS doing with you?

285
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,720
他们想知道谁帮助我抵达边界
They wanted to find out who helped me to the border.

286
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:37,720
-这里还有谁？有卡文迪斯吗？ -有的
- Who else is here? Cavendish? - Mm-hm.

287
00:30:37,790 --> 00:30:40,690
-尼莫和索伦呢？ -葛里菲斯 海因斯
- Nimmo and Sorren? - Griffith, Haynes.

288
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,780
-布莱斯呢？ -有的
- Blythe? - Yes.

289
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,960
几乎整个X组织都在
Almost the whole X organization.

290
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,260
差不多
Almost.

291
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:51,100
德国人清理所有的营地 把我们都扔在这里
They cleaned out all the other camps and dumped us in this one.

292
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:55,000
就像鲁格说的： 所有的坏蛋都在一个篮子里
As Von Luger put it, "All the rotten eggs in one basket."

293
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,330
他们的方法有点疯狂
There's madness in their method.

294
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,640
汤米布里斯托呢？
- What about Tommy Bristol?

295
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:03,110
不在 但是有美国人韩德利
No, but there's an American, Hendley.

296
00:31:04,550 --> 00:31:06,740
他擅长敲诈吗？
Is he a scrounger, blackmailer?

297
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:10,450
-麦居纳说他是最行的 -好
- MacDonald says he's the best. - Good.

298
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:14,820
在红十字物资再来以前 这是最后的茶了
Last of the tea until the Red Cross gets through again.

299
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,260
我从塞奇威克敲来的
I scrounged this from Sedgwick.

300
00:31:22,470 --> 00:31:25,460
秘密警察有没有让你受罪？
Did the Gestapo give you a rough time?

301
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:28,370
没有我想要他们受的多
Not nearly as rough as I now intend to give them.

302
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:34,010
罗杰 个人恩怨不能和 我们要做的事混为一谈
Roger, personal revenge must be kept out of what we have to do here.

303
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,480
攸关的人命太多了
Too many lives are at stake.

304
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,680
我个人的感觉并不重要
What my personal feelings are is of no importance.

305
00:31:43,650 --> 00:31:45,780
你派我领导X组织
You appointed me Big X, and it's my duty to harass,

306
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,650
我的责任是尽力扰乱 困惑与混淆敌人
confound and confuse the enemy to the best of my ability.

307
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:52,990
-没错 -那就是我要做的事
- That's true. - That's what I intend to do.

308
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,590
我要在他们的帝国里制造极大的麻烦
I'm gonna cause such a terrible stink in this Third Reich of theirs

309
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:02,860
牵制好几千部队来寻找我们
that thousands of troops'll be tied up here looking after us.

310
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:04,470
怎么做呢？
How?

311
00:32:04,510 --> 00:32:07,470
派出更多的人…
By putting more men out of this...

312
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:10,510
逃出他们自认为完美的战俘营
perfect camp of theirs than have ever escaped before.

313
00:32:10,580 --> 00:32:15,510
不是二三十人 而是二三百人 让他们散布到德国各地
Not two or three or a dozen, but 200, 300. Scatter them all over Germany.

314
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:18,080
-能做到吗？ -这里人才济济
- Think that's possible? - The men are hereto do it.

315
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:22,850
你自己说的  他们把全德国每个逃脱专家都关在这里
The goons have put every escape artist in Germany here. You said so yourself.

316
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:25,580
你想过可能的代价？
Have you thought of what it might cost?

317
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,330
我想过如果我们就此温顺屈服
I've thought of the humiliation if we just tamely submit,

318
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,800
对他们卑身屈膝
knuckle under and crawl.

319
00:32:34,870 --> 00:32:37,990
长官 你当然不提倡屈服吧？
Surely you don't advocate that, do you, sir?

320
00:32:38,140 --> 00:32:41,040
罗杰 我必须指出一件事
I have to point out one thing to you, Roger.

321
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:44,160
不论这个营地多糟
No matter how unsatisfactory this camp may be,

322
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,200
德军高层仍然让德国空军 来看管我们
the high command have left us in the hands of the Luftwaffe,

323
00:32:47,310 --> 00:32:49,370
不是秘密警察与党军
not the Gestapo and the SS.

324
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:55,320
长官 你提到德国空军高层
Look, sir, you talk about the high command of the Luftwaffe,

325
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:57,050
还有党军与秘密警察
then the SS and the Gestapo.

326
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:01,110
我认为他们都是一样的 我们要对抗他们全体
To me they're the same. We're fighting the bloody lot.

327
00:33:01,190 --> 00:33:03,180
一言概之
There's only one way to put it, sir.

328
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:06,960
他们是每个信仰自由的人的公敌
They are the common enemies of everyone who believes in freedom.

329
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,050
如果他们不认同希特勒 为什么不推翻他？
If they didn't approve of Hitler, why didn't they throw him out?

330
00:33:10,130 --> 00:33:12,860
罗杰 我不与你争议
I have no argument with you, Roger.

331
00:33:12,970 --> 00:33:16,930
身为高阶军官 我只是指出有关的事实
As senior officer, I'm merely pointing out a pertinent fact.

332
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,810
X 你什么时候召开会议？
When are you calling a meeting, X?

333
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,910
今天晚上
Tonight.

334
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:50,430
各位 你们无疑都听过新指挥官的不朽名言
Gentlemen, no doubt you've heard the immortal words of our new commandant.

335
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,960
“把你们的精力用在 逃脱之外的事情上”
"Devote your energies to things other than escape,

336
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,440
舒服地等待战争结束
and sit out the war as comfortably as possible."

337
00:33:57,840 --> 00:34:00,900
那就是我们要做的
Well, that's exactly what we're going to do.

338
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:04,280
我们要把精力用在运动与园艺
We're going to devote our energies to sports and gardening,

339
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:07,220
还有他们认同的种种文化活动
all the cultural pursuits as far as they're concerned.

340
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:10,280
让他们放松警戒
In fact, we're going to put the goons to sleep.

341
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:13,890
同时…我们也要挖地道
Meanwhile... we dig.

342
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:18,480
只要稍微观察一下营地
Now, even a superficial look at the compound

343
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,890
就会发现104号与105号营房 最接近树林
shows us that huts 104 and five are closest to the woods.

344
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,300
第一条地道从105出发
The first tunnel goes out from 105,

345
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:27,430
向东穿过禁闭室与铁丝网底下
directly east under the cooler and the wire.

346
00:34:27,510 --> 00:34:29,730
罗杰 那有九十多米
But that's over 300 feet, Roger.

347
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:32,830
-丹尼斯 你测量过吗？ -只是初步测量
- Did you make a survey, Dennis? - Only a temporary one, sir.

348
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:36,600
-估计有一百多米 -有精确数字再告诉我
- I make it just over 335 feet. - Tell me when you've got an exact one.

349
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:40,640
威利 我们这次向下挖十米 然后再转水平方向
Willie, this time we'll dig straight down 30 feet before we go horizontal.

350
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:44,050
那就可以消除声响或者探针的探测
That'll rule out any question of sound detection or probing.

351
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,590
好的 罗杰 但是… 你是不是说第一条地道？
All right, Roger, but... did you say the first tunnel?

352
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:50,650
是的 总共有三条
I did. There'll be three.

353
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,190
我们叫它们汤姆 狄克与哈利 汤姆从104直接向东
We'll call them Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom goes out directly east from 104.

354
00:34:56,300 --> 00:35:01,230
狄克从厨房向北 哈利从105出发与汤姆平行
Dick goes north from the kitchen, and Harry goes out parallel to Tom from 105.

355
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:06,070
如果警卫发现一条地道 我们就转移到另一条
If the goons find one, we'll move into the other.

356
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:10,070
罗杰 你计划带多少人出去？
How many men do you plan to take out, Roger?

357
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,270
250人
Two hundred and fifty.

358
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:17,470
这一次要有充份准备 人人都要有身份证件
There'll be no half measures this time. Identification papers for everyone.

359
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:20,710
葛里夫 我们需要服装
And, Griff, we'll need outfits for the lot.

360
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:23,340
-250个人的？ 大部份是平民便服
- Two hundred and fifty? - Mostly civilian clothes.

361
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:25,410
但是…
Yes, but, uh...

362
00:35:27,030 --> 00:35:28,690
罗杰 好的
OK, Roger.

363
00:35:28,790 --> 00:35:33,520
麦克 从步的人要有地图 毯子 口粮 罗盘
Mac. Maps, blankets, rations, compasses for all the walkers.

364
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,960
-每班火车的时刻表 -好的 罗杰
- Timetables for every train. - Right, Roger.

365
00:35:41,740 --> 00:35:44,970
-抱歉 我迟到了 -柯林 没关系 请坐
- Sorry I'm late, Roger. - It's all right, Colin. Sit down.

366
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:46,970
我们要挖地道
- We're going to tunnel. -

367
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:50,370
好极了
Splendid.

368
00:35:50,810 --> 00:35:56,270
威利和丹尼负责地道 丹尼负责设立活门
Willie, you and Danny'll be tunnel kings. Danny, in charge of traps.

369
00:35:56,350 --> 00:35:59,580
塞奇威克制造工具 葛里夫做裁缝
Sedgwick, manufacturer. Griff, as I said, tailor.

370
00:35:59,690 --> 00:36:04,620
尼莫和海因斯分散警卫注意力 麦克当然是负责情报
Nimmo and Haynes, diversions. Mac, of course, will take care of intelligence.

371
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:07,090
韩德利 幸会
Hendley. We haven't met.

372
00:36:07,160 --> 00:36:09,130
-敲诈专家？ -是的
- Scrounger? - Right.

373
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,630
丹尼斯负责地图和测量
Dennis, maps and surveys.

374
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,290
柯林的任务与以前一样
Colin, you'll take your usual job.

375
00:36:15,370 --> 00:36:17,360
艾利克 你要怎样解决废土？
Eric, how are you gonna get rid of this dirt?

376
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:22,440
老地方 我没想到有三条地道 但是事在人为
Usual places. I hadn't anticipated three tunnels, but we'll manage.

377
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,880
罗杰 谁负责保密？
Roger, who's going to handle security for all this?

378
00:36:25,910 --> 00:36:30,040
你负责 我需要监视系统 前后兼顾
You are. I want a system of stooges covering this compound

379
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,110
涵盖整个营区 跟踪每个警卫的动静
from front to back, checking every goon in and out.

380
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,240
我需要完美的信号系统
I want a signal system so perfect that

381
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:39,780
如果警卫走近工作营房15米内
if ever a ferret gets within 50 feet of any of the huts in which we're working,

382
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,120
我们就能无声无息停止工作
we can shut down without a sign.

383
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,960
今晚讨论到此为止
Well, I don't think there's much point in discussing any more now.

384
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,030
我与各位在运动场见面 敲定细节
I'll meet each of you on the exercise circuit, we'll pound out the details.

385
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,530
没别的事了 麦克？
- Nothing else, is there, Mac?

386
00:36:57,610 --> 00:36:59,940
没有了
I shouldn't think so, Roger.

387
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,830
你好
Oh, hello.

388
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,490
我是布莱斯
My name's Blythe.

389
00:37:30,840 --> 00:37:31,860
我是韩德利
Hendley.

390
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,410
-看鸟用的 -我以前也打猎
- For birds. - I used to do a little hunting myself.

391
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:42,240
不是打猎 是观赏
Oh, not hunting. Watching.

392
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,980
是…赏鸟者？
Oh, a... bird watcher?

393
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:49,790
是的 赏鸟与画鸟
Yes, that's right. Watching them and drawing them.

394
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:55,190
美国应该也有赏鸟者？
I suppose you have bird watchers in the States?

395
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:57,390
有一些
Yes, we have some.

396
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,060
喝茶吗？
Tea?

397
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:03,730
我只在住院时喝过一次茶
I only drank tea once, in the hospital.

398
00:38:05,610 --> 00:38:07,500
你的东西在哪里？
- Where's your kit? - This is it.

399
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:11,810
就这些 其他的 在上次大检查时被没收了
The rest was confiscated in the last shakedown.

400
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:17,080
警卫不喜欢我的某些… 个人物品
The goons didn't appreciate some of my more... personal items.

401
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:21,980
比如说这个
Such as.

402
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:25,790
你是敲诈专家 -是的
- You're the scrounger. - Yes, that's right.

403
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:28,410
我需要一架照相机
I'll need a camera.

404
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:32,290
什么类型？ -好用的
- What kind? - A good one.

405
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:37,700
35毫米镜头 2.8焦距 和焦平面快门就可以了
A 35mm f2.8 with a focal-plane shutter should do all right.

406
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,690
好的
All right.

407
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:44,100
-还要胶卷 -当然
- And film, of course. - Oh, of course.

408
00:38:46,010 --> 00:38:49,600
韩德利 我需要大型尖嘴锄
Oh, Hendley. I need a pick. Big heavy one.

409
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:52,140
-只要一个？ -两个更好
- Only one? - Two would be better.

410
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:59,120
这杯茶恐怕淡得很
I'm afraid this tea's pathetic.

411
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:03,250
这些烂茶叶 我一定泡过大约二十次了
I must have used these wretched leaves about 20 times.

412
00:39:03,330 --> 00:39:05,850
不是我过份挑别
It's not that I mind so much.

413
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:08,620
但是没有牛奶的茶太不文明了
Tea without milk is so uncivilized.

414
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:13,290
我去找木头
Yeah. I'll get our wood.

415
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,000
关窗！关窗！
Close up! Close up!

416
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,110
关窗！
Close up!

417
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:40,720
-听不懂 请说英语 -关窗！
- No me sprechen the English. - Close up!

418
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:07,570
太好了
Oh. Splendid.

419
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:22,330
布莱斯 你在这里做什么？
- Blythe, what are you doing here? - Hmm? Oh.

420
00:40:23,700 --> 00:40:27,570
我在解读空中祯照的单位
I'm in Photographic Aerial Reconnaissance Interpretation.

421
00:40:27,640 --> 00:40:31,570
顺便开飞机亲自去看看 都是我不好
Went for a joyride to see for myself. It's my own silly fault.

422
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:36,540
飞机被打中击落了 真可怕
The aircraft bought it. Got shot down. Terrifying.

423
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:41,610
不 我是说在营里做什么？ 一战俘营里？
- No, I mean, what do you do here? - Here?

424
00:40:43,850 --> 00:40:45,840
我是伪造专家
I'm the forger.

425
00:41:06,110 --> 00:41:08,590
伪造专家都在休闲厅里
Forgers are installing themselves in the recreation hut.

426
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,110
-塞奇威克呢？ -我在110号营房
- Sedgwick? - I'm in 110.

427
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:13,800
-葛里菲斯 -我想在109号工作
- Griffith. - Well, I'd like to work in 109, Roger.

428
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:16,070
109？好的
- 109? Right. - I'll work in 107.

429
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:20,640
我在107 丹尼 威利和活门队员在104
For now, Danny, Willie and their trap team will be in 104.

430
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:25,050
麦克 我想在地道方面冒险 不用支撑就向前挖掘
I want to take a chance on the tunnels and press ahead without any shoring-up.

431
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:28,420
我们需要木材支撑竖坑和进出室
We will need timber for the shafts and the entrance chambers.

432
00:41:28,490 --> 00:41:31,150
韩德利算过有36个空床位
Hendley figures there are 36 empty bunks.

433
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,920
我们折拌15个 然后调动人员 以免被警卫发觉
We can tear up 15 and move the men around so the goons won't miss them.

434
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,160
其他的木材要靠折墙板
The rest will come from strips off the wall.

435
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:40,260
-韩德利在亲自处理吗？ -还没有
Is Hendley taking care of this himself? - Not yet.

436
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:43,430
他正在设法帮丹尼弄到 尖嘴锄的钢材
He's working on some steel for a pick that Danny needs.

437
00:42:01,220 --> 00:42:03,780
这里在搞什么鬼？
Hey! What the hell is going on here?

438
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:07,190
把水关掉！把手拿开！
Turn the water off! Get your hands away!

439
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,660
滚开！
Get away!

440
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:13,620
嘿！这里在搞什么鬼？
Hey! What the hell's going on there?

441
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:16,540
停止胡闹！
Stop this nonsense!

442
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:20,800
滚开！
Get away!

443
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:22,500
把水关掉！
Turn the water off!

444
00:42:22,580 --> 00:42:23,560
滚开！
Somewhere!

445
00:43:03,610 --> 00:43:09,640
我们让炉子一直燃烧 警卫就不会发觉炉子被搬开了
In the stove, we keep fire burning, always. The goons will not feel like moving it.

446
00:43:09,720 --> 00:43:14,590
韩德利 两块磁砖砍了 我们需要新的
- Good. - Hendley, two tiles, they are chipped. We need new ones.

447
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:18,590
113的盘洗室里有一些 应该会天衣无缝
- There's some in 113's washroom. - Should match perfectly. - Good.

448
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:30,370
丹尼 这件事有点难度
It's going to be a bit tricky, Danny.

449
00:43:31,670 --> 00:43:33,730
麦克 有组织就不难
Not when you're organized, Mac.

450
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,640
-我们准备好了 -够大吗？
- We're ready. - Big enough?

451
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:44,740
好极了 正好穿过地基的中央
It's perfect. Right through the middle of the foundation.

452
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,150
丹尼 祝我们好运
Good luck to us, Danny.

453
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,570
为什么写17 ?
Why 17?

454
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,570
这是丹尼开挖的第17条地道
This is the 17th tunnel Danny's started.

455
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:50,300
没事吧？
All right?

456
00:45:05,430 --> 00:45:07,390
情况还可以
It's good.

457
00:45:16,140 --> 00:45:18,130
很好
It's very good.

458
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:58,460
出去！
- Get out! - Raus hier!

459
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:25,500
怎么不在你的营房里？ 你在这里做什么？
You're not in your hut? What are you doing here?

460
00:46:25,570 --> 00:46:26,560
拖地
Mopping UP-

461
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:34,030
-你呢？ -淋浴 我需要洗澡
- And you? - Shower. I need a wash.

462
00:46:38,050 --> 00:46:40,940
我在照顾他 我是救生员
I'm watching him. I'm a lifeguard.

463
00:46:45,390 --> 00:46:48,840
穿上保暖的衣服 你可能整晚都在外面罚站
Put on warm clothes. You might be outside all night.

464
00:47:37,070 --> 00:47:41,660
我反对 我们已经完全照你说的让警卫松懈
No. I vote no. Look, we've put the goons to sleep exactly like you said.

465
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:46,170
但是这样的小问题 足以使我们陷入困境
But just one little thing like this and we're up the creek without a paddle.

466
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:49,710
-艾弗斯 坐下 -你好 长官
- Ives, sit down, won't you? - Hello, sir.

467
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:52,640
这是巴特利少校 希尔兹上尉
Hello. Squadron Leader Bartlett, Captain Hilts.

468
00:47:52,710 --> 00:47:55,370
麦唐纳上尉
Flight Lieutenant MacDonald.

469
00:47:55,450 --> 00:47:59,040
我听说你们俩个想逃出去
I understand you two are contemplating a blitz-out.

470
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:01,380
长官…你从哪里听说的？
Where'd you hear that... sir?

471
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,290
麦居纳说的 他有责任知道每一件事
MacDonald. It's Mac's job to know everything that goes on.

472
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:08,290
我们想好好谈一谈
We thought, perhaps, we might talk it over.

473
00:48:08,360 --> 00:48:10,790
为什么？这只是两个人的事
Why? It's only a two-man job.

474
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:14,590
营里每个人都应该事先向巴特利少校
Everybody in the camp is supposed to clear all escape attempts in advance

475
00:48:14,770 --> 00:48:17,170
申请获准逃脱的企图
with Squadron Leader Bartlett here.

476
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:19,600
我们不想干扰你们
We don't necessarily want to interfere.

477
00:48:19,710 --> 00:48:24,940
只不过… 你们计划怎样逃脱？
It's just that... Well, what sort of blitz were you contemplating?

478
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,880
我们晚上溜出去 到铁丝网旁边我发现的盲点
We sneak out at night to a spot I found near the wire, a blind spot.

479
00:48:28,950 --> 00:48:32,510
然后我们向下挖一米 把土散开以免堆起来
Then we dig down, take the dirt, spread it on top so it won't make a pile,

480
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,380
然后一直挖出去
and then straight out.

481
00:48:34,450 --> 00:48:38,410
艾弗斯是地道专家 他在前面挖 把土推到后面
Ives here is a tunnel man, so he digs in front, pushes the dirt behind him.

482
00:48:38,490 --> 00:48:42,320
我把土推到后面 然后我们 像两只地鼠一样钻过泥土
I stash it behind me, then we burrow through the dirt like a couple of moles.

483
00:48:42,390 --> 00:48:47,390
天亮时 我们从铁丝网底下 越过空地 进入树林逃走
By dawn we're under the wire, across the open space, into the woods and gone.

484
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:54,900
这个嘛…
Well, uh...

485
00:48:57,770 --> 00:49:00,470
你打算何时试看看？
- When do you intend to try this? - Hmm?

486
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,040
-你打算何时试看看？ -就在今晚
- When do you intend to try it? - Oh, tonight.

487
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:08,640
希尔兹 现在可能不是 做这种事的适当时机
Hilts, this may not be quite the right time for this sort of thing.

488
00:49:08,680 --> 00:49:12,050
长官 我被关已经快三年了
Look, sir, I've been in the bag nearly three years now,

489
00:49:12,120 --> 00:49:14,490
我快要疯了
bloody close to being wire-happy.

490
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,550
我要逃出去 其他免谈
It's a blitz-out for me, or forget it.

491
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:20,530
会成功的 我知道会成功的
It'll Work. I know it Will.

492
00:49:28,540 --> 00:49:30,030
祝你好运
Good luck.

493
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:32,170
谢谢你
Thank you.

494
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,240
-希尔兹 你们怎么呼吸？ -我们有一根附铰链的钢棒
- Hilts, um... how do you breathe? - We got a steel rod with hinges on it.

495
00:49:38,310 --> 00:49:41,010
前进时 把它向上推 戳出通气孔
We shove it up and make air holes as we go along.

496
00:49:41,080 --> 00:49:43,050
长官 晚安
Good night, sir.

497
00:49:48,820 --> 00:49:51,850
为什么以前没人想到那一招？
Now, why didn't anybody think of that before?

498
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:55,320
这真是简单到了高明之至
It's so stupid, it's positively brilliant.

499
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,590
但是会使营地里 每个警卫紧盯我们
But it'll bring every goon in the camp down on top of us.

500
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:00,960
不一定 或许我们聪明过头了
I don't know. Perhaps we're being too clever.

501
00:50:01,030 --> 00:50:03,090
如果我们阻止所有的逃脱
If we stop all the breakouts,

502
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:06,790
警卫反而会认定 我们在挖地道
it may only convince the goons that we must be tunneling.

503
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:12,700
我希望他们成功 否则 他们会在禁闭室呆很久
I hope it works. If it doesn't, they're going to be in the cooler for an awful long time.

504
00:50:58,320 --> 00:51:01,310
-好吗？ -丹尼 这美极了
- Good, huh? - Danny, it's bloody beautiful.

505
00:51:07,790 --> 00:51:11,630
-这是营地里的土 -这是地道里的土
This is the dirt from the compound. - This is from the tunnel.

506
00:51:17,770 --> 00:51:21,030
不论把土放在哪里 他们大老远就能看见
Wherever we put it, they're going to spot it a mile away.

507
00:51:21,110 --> 00:51:24,200
或许可以放在营房底下 那里的土色比较深
Maybe we could put it under the huts. The dirt's dark there.

508
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,900
那是警卫首个检查的地方 我昨天看到他们在测量
It's the first place the ferrets'd look. I saw one measuring yesterday.

509
00:51:27,980 --> 00:51:30,410
或许可以烘干到同样颜色
Maybe we could dry it to the same color.

510
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:34,510
-但是有50吨的土 -我只是想到什么就说什么
- There are 50 tons of it. - I was just thinking out loud.

511
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,950
如果你要思考 就想清楚一点
If you must think, for God's sake, think clearly.

512
00:51:39,020 --> 00:51:40,990
艾希利皮特在哪里？
Where the devil is Ashley-Pitt?

513
00:51:42,530 --> 00:51:45,460
我们无法摧毁 吃掉废土
We can't destroy the dirt and we can't eat it.

514
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:49,260
唯一的方法就是梅饰
The only thing left to do is camouflage it.

515
00:51:49,370 --> 00:51:52,130
我只能想到这么多
That's as far as my thinking takes me.

516
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:55,760
皇家海军没有教你要迅速吗？
Didn't they teach you promptness in the RN?

517
00:51:55,840 --> 00:51:58,900
你们绝对不会相信 但是我有解决的方法了
You'll never believe it, but I think I have the solution.

518
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:03,170
我们要想办法 把地道废土散布到营地各处
The problem is somehow to get rid of this tunnel dirt over the compound.

519
00:52:03,250 --> 00:52:05,230
当然是的
Well, of course.

520
00:52:05,850 --> 00:52:07,840
请让一下好吗？
Would you mind?

521
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:19,660
现在…
Now...

522
00:52:21,430 --> 00:52:24,950
将地道的废土装满这些袋子
you fill these bags with the dirt from the tunnel.

523
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:28,470
然后把袋子穿在长裤里面
Then, wearing them inside your trousers,

524
00:52:28,540 --> 00:52:30,690
你在营地里闲进
you wander out into the compound

525
00:52:30,770 --> 00:52:34,930
拉动裤袋里的绳子
where you pull these strings in your pockets.

526
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,170
废土就会掉下来
Out come the pins.

527
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:45,980
-艾利克 好办法 -你只要用脚混合泥土
- Eric, it's good. - All you have to do is kick it in.

528
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:48,770
除非你是傻瓜 否则警卫不会看到的
Unless you're a fool, the ferrets won't see a thing.

529
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,940
这真是鬼聪明 罗杰 你认为好不好？
It's indecently brilliant. What do you think, Roger?

530
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:56,190
-明天一早试试看 -我已经试过了 而且成功了
- We'll try it first thing tomorrow. - I already have. it works.

531
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:00,660
麦克 我们要林取这些行动
Mac, this is what we'll do.

532
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:18,510
-汤姆送的小礼物 -谢谢你
- A little present from Tom, sir. - Thank you, Nimmo.

533
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:29,160
长官 菜园真不错
Nice garden you've got, sir.

534
00:54:02,220 --> 00:54:04,350
注意 好好表现一下
All right. Let's look sharp.

535
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:12,590
表现得很好
That looks sharp.

536
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:18,660
长官
Sir.

537
00:54:22,010 --> 00:54:26,240
各位先生 请继绩 这只是例行检查
Please, gentlemen, continue. This is merely a routine inspection.

538
00:54:41,460 --> 00:54:44,050
-上校 -长官 早安  早安
- Good morning, Squadron Leader. - Good morning, sir.

539
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:48,290
很抱歉这里的土坏不适合种植
I am sorry the soil here isn't better suited to your men's purpose.

540
00:54:48,330 --> 00:54:50,320
我们能应付
We'll manage, sir.

541
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:03,970
上校 我对园艺的规模大感意外
I must say I am surprised with the extent of this activity, Group Captain.

542
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:08,010
-既高兴又惊奇 -怎么会惊奇？
- Pleased, of course, but surprised. - Surprised, Colonel?

543
00:55:08,120 --> 00:55:13,920
飞行员是绅士 不是农人 居然在挖土
Fliers are gentlemen, not peasants to dig in the earth. So I am surprised.

544
00:55:14,060 --> 00:55:16,250
英国人一向热爱田艺
- The English are keen on gardening. - Oh, yes, but flowers. Is this not so?

545
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:20,250
但那是说种花 不是吗？

546
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,390
花不能吃
You can't eat flowers, Colonel.

547
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,520
有道理
Good point.

548
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,850
我有不祥之感 他好像完全知道我们在做什么
I have the nasty feeling he knows exactly what we're doing.

549
00:55:47,850 --> 00:55:51,150
-也许吧 不是真的吧？
- Maybe he does. - You don't really think so, do you?

550
00:55:51,220 --> 00:55:53,710
很快就会知道谜底了
If he does, we'll find out soon enough.

551
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:07,490
-鲍伯 早安 -安迪
- Morning, Bob. - Andy.

552
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:11,010
东西到了 我们清点一下

00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:32,280
鲁格的丹麦奶油 我从他的补给品收复来的
Danish butter, Von Luger's. I liberated it from his mess supplies.

560
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:37,020
唤 还有两条荷兰巧克力
Oh, yes. And Dutch chocolate. Two bars.

561
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,430
整个组织的食物礼品 都捐出来了
That cleans out the gift food for the entire organization.

562
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:44,700
我们需要的第一样东西 就是新式通行证
Now, the first thing we need is the new form of travel permit.

563
00:56:44,810 --> 00:56:47,700
伪造专家从未见过新式通行证
The forgers have no idea what it looks like.

564
00:56:47,770 --> 00:56:49,140
我来想想办法
I'll see what I can do.

565
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:52,900
还要其他你能弄到手的身份证
And, of course, any other identity cards, personal papers,

566
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,240
个人证件和文件
documents you can put your hands on.

567
00:56:55,320 --> 00:56:57,510
-好好利用它们 -是的
- Anyway, put 'em to work, Bob. - Right.

568
00:56:57,580 --> 00:56:59,570
祝好运
Good luck.

569
00:57:07,590 --> 00:57:11,690
信神的人们来吧
O come all ye faithful

570
00:57:11,760 --> 00:57:15,030
欢欣又鼓舞
Joyful and triumphant

571
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:17,160
大家来吧
O come ye

578
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:44,380
路易 鼓风机在什么鬼地方？
Louis, where the hell is the air pump?

579
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,430
耐心是一种美德
Patience is a virtue, Roger.

580
00:57:46,430 --> 00:57:50,300
我知道 但是只有打开活门 挖地道的人才能工作
Yes, I know, but the diggers can only work when the trap's open,

581
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,870
这严重阻碍了进程
and this is holding us up very badly.

582
00:57:54,900 --> 00:57:56,870
-鼓风机完成了吗？ -当然
- Is it finished? - Of course.

583
00:57:57,070 --> 00:57:59,970
-为什么没装进去？ -因为正在制造通风管
- Why isn't it in? - Working on the air ducts now.

586
00:58:07,010 --> 00:58:10,170
-能提供足够的空气吗？ -绰绰有余
- Will it give us enough air? - As much as you'll need.

587
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:12,380
麦克
Mac.

588
00:58:12,450 --> 00:58:14,440
好极了
Excellent.

589
00:58:15,420 --> 00:58:17,910
明天晚上以前装进去
Have it in by tomorrow night.

590
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:30,960
-有火吗？ -有
- Got a light? - Yeah.

591
00:58:34,140 --> 00:58:35,800
多谢
Thanks.

592
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:38,200
-真不赖 是吗？ -是不赖
- It's pretty, isn't it? - Yes.

593
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:48,840
抱歉 你要一根吗？
Oh, I'm sorry. Would you like one?

594
00:58:51,320 --> 00:58:54,480
我下岗后再抽 谢谢
I'll smoke it later, when I'm off duty. Thank you.

595
00:58:54,560 --> 00:58:57,550
你或许有两个室友
You probably have a couple of roommates, huh?

596
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:03,560
-好天气 -是啊 可能会下雨
- Beautiful day. - Yes, but I think it might rain later.

597
00:59:03,630 --> 00:59:05,190
不会 不会
No, no.

598
00:59:05,340 --> 00:59:08,330
早晨的天空发红 水手就紧张
Red sky in the morning, sailor takes warning.

599
00:59:08,410 --> 00:59:10,530
晚上的天空发红 水手就高兴
Red sky at night, sailor's delight.

600
00:59:10,610 --> 00:59:12,700
昨晚的天空是红的
It was a red sky last night.

601
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,710
我从没听说过
I never heard that before.

602
00:59:14,780 --> 00:59:17,210
我在童子军学的
I learned it in the Boy Scouts.

603
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:19,840
-你以前是童子军？我也是 -真的？
- You were a Boy Scout? So was I. - Really?

604
00:59:19,910 --> 00:59:22,900
-是啊 我有19个奖章 -我有20个
- Yes. I had 19 merit badges. - I had 20.

605
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:27,720
我正在争取第20个时 政府废除了童军制度
I was working on my 20th when the government abolished scouting

606
00:59:27,790 --> 00:59:31,420
并把我送进希特勒青年团
and sent me into the Hitler Youth instead.

607
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:38,660
韦纳 战后你会留在军队里吗？
Werner, you think you'll stay in the army after the war?

608
00:59:38,730 --> 00:59:41,600
不会 我身体不好
No. I'm not a well man.

609
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,460
-我的牙齿… -你的牙齿？
- And my teeth... - Your teeth?

610
00:59:43,540 --> 00:59:46,870
对了 关于我牙齿的故事
Yes. I could tell you stories about my teeth

611
00:59:46,940 --> 00:59:48,770
会让你毛骨悚然
that would make your hair stand on end.

612
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:51,240
这里的牙医是屠夫
Our dentist here is a butcher.

613
00:59:52,650 --> 00:59:55,130
不要告诉别人我这么说
But don't tell anyone I said so.

614
00:59:55,920 --> 00:59:58,400
军人有抱怨的权利
- It's a soldier's right to complain.

615
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:00,970
也许你的军队就行 这里嘛？
Maybe in your army, but here?

616
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:06,010
提出一点批评 就被送到…俄国前线
One little criticism, and... to the Russian front.

617
01:00:06,190 --> 01:00:09,650
是这样吗？真可怕
Is that so? Terrible.

618
01:00:10,500 --> 01:00:12,460
那太可怕了
That's terrible.

619
01:00:17,860 --> 01:00:19,850
韦纳
Werner.

620
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:24,690
到我房间去谈好吗？舒服些
Why don't we go into my room?

621
01:00:24,830 --> 01:00:27,820
最好不要 如果斯塔赫维兹看见…
I'd better not. If Strachwitz should see me...

622
01:00:30,470 --> 01:00:33,130
我只是要泡咖啡
I was just gonna make some coffee.

623
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:37,610
真正的咖啡
Real coffee.

624
01:01:05,850 --> 01:01:07,840
咖啡
Coffee, coffee, coffee.

625
01:01:08,750 --> 01:01:10,720
咖啡在哪里？
Where is it?

626
01:01:14,780 --> 01:01:16,780
果酱 真好
Marmelade. Ist ja wunderbar.

627
01:01:16,790 --> 01:01:20,160
我祖母老是寄这种东西给我
My grandmother keeps sending me this stuff.

628
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:25,560
天哪 巧克力
- Ach du lieber Gott, Schokolade.

629
01:01:25,570 --> 01:01:28,060
来 拿一个
Oh, yeah. Here. Take one.

630
01:01:34,450 --> 01:01:36,210
鲁格的奶油
- Von Lugers Butter.

631
01:01:36,380 --> 01:01:38,480
是啊 收下吧
Yeah. Keep it.

632
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:40,450
不行 我该走了
Nein. I must go.

633
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,820
没关系 拿去吧 我们是朋友
It's OK. You can keep it. We're friends.

634
01:01:43,930 --> 01:01:47,020
你关禁闭 我们还是朋友？ 我必须报告这件事
With you in the cooler, will we be friends? I must report this.

635
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:52,530
报告什么？ 说你和我在我的房间聊天？
I don't understand you. Report what? That you and I were chatting in my room?

636
01:01:52,600 --> 01:01:55,470
-我必须走了 -拿着 没问题的
- I must go. - Oh, here. It's OK. Look, keep it.

637
01:01:55,540 --> 01:01:59,170
我反正吃不了这么多
- I'll never be able to eat it all. - Nein, ich muss jetzt weg.

638
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,940
对不起 算了
I'm sorry. All right. Forget it. Forget it.

639
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:39,260
相信各位都记得那是莺鸟的呜声
And that, I'm sure you'll all remember, is the voice of the Nelles warbler.

640
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:42,530
现在看看这一位 花面伯劳
Let's turn our attention to this gentleman, the masked shrike.

641
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:45,120
又名屠夫鸟
Lanius nubicus. The butcherbird.

642
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:48,900
伯劳把敌人钉在练树丛的刺上面
The shrike impales his foes on the spikes of thorn bushes.

643
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:52,670
个性不怎么招人喜爱 看看他的色彩
Not a very lovable character, you see. Let's have a look at the coloring.

644
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:56,230
青面从头到尾是黑的
Uniform black above, from head to tail.

645
01:02:56,350 --> 01:03:01,750
黑臀部 黑冠有清晰的白斑 眼睛上方有白线
A black rump, a black crown with a bold white flash, and a white line over the eye.

646
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:04,720
伯劳栖息在稀疏林地…
The shrike lives in lightly wooded country...

647
01:03:04,790 --> 01:03:08,890
韩德利 请坐 桌上有绘画材料
Ah. Hendley. Sit down. You'll find drawing materials on the table.

648
01:03:09,630 --> 01:03:13,620
伯劳栖息在稀疏林地 橄榄园和果园里
The shrike lives in lightly wooded country, olive groves and gardens.

649
01:03:13,700 --> 01:03:16,230
韩德利 你也赏乌吗？
Well, Hendley, have you taken to birds, too, now?

650
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:19,010
是的 别走开 学点知识
Yeah. Stick around. You might learn something.

651
01:03:19,010 --> 01:03:21,800
我有比画乌更重要的事可做
I have better things to do than draw birds.

652
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:27,950
呜声是单调连绩的音符 组糙又难听
The voice is a monotonous succession of scratchy, complaining notes.

653
01:03:28,050 --> 01:03:31,540
仔细看看这只鸟 他有圆形的…
Now, let's have a good look at this bird. He's got a round shape...

654
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:55,950
越过边界的许可证 这里还有一张
An Urlaubsschein. Permission to cross a frontier. Here's another one.

655
01:03:56,020 --> 01:03:58,450
哪一张是伪造的？
Which one's the forgery?

656
01:03:59,860 --> 01:04:02,070
这张 -对
- That one. - That's right.

657
01:04:02,190 --> 01:04:03,950
两张都是伪造的
They both are.

658
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,620
现在阻碍进度的是 新式通行证
What's holding us up now is the new form of this travel permit.

659
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:11,000
-我们不知道它们是什么样子 -这里有一张
- We've no idea what they look like. - Here's one.

660
01:04:12,240 --> 01:04:14,730
还有一张军人身份证
And a military identity card.

661
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,140
还有…
And a...

662
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:18,870
出入证 -对
- An Ausweis. - Yeah.

663
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:22,940
-可以进入官方地点 -到奥登的火车祟
- Permission to be on Reich property. - A ticket to Oden.

664
01:04:22,980 --> 01:04:27,080
似乎是祯探警卫 下星期要去的地方
What appears to be the ferret assignments for the next week.

665
01:04:27,690 --> 01:04:30,020
你这次得满分了
You get ten out of ten for this, old boy.

666
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:34,050
-谢谢 小心保管 -你从哪里弄来的？
Thank you, sir. Take good care of that. - Where did you get this?

667
01:04:35,100 --> 01:04:37,070
暂时借来的
It's on loan.

668
01:04:38,600 --> 01:04:41,430
为了制造足够的服装
In order to get the right amount of outfits, Roger,

669
01:04:41,510 --> 01:04:44,960
我建议以改造军服为主
I suggest that we work mainly from service uniforms.

670
01:04:45,040 --> 01:04:48,950
我会做双排卡 单排卡
I can do double-breasteds, single-breasteds,

671
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:52,010
还有很好看的普通西装
and rather nice lounge suits.

672
01:04:52,090 --> 01:04:54,710
我会做多种花样的翻领
Lapels. I can do quite a lot of things with those.

673
01:04:54,790 --> 01:04:59,450
可以做得那废低 或者那么高
I can have them deep like that, or high ones like that.

674
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,760
我们正在做这一件
Here's one that we're working on right now.

675
01:05:03,870 --> 01:05:06,530
卡子怎么办？
Oh, yes. What about buttons?

676
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:09,600
看看那些
Take a look at those.

677
01:05:09,710 --> 01:05:12,270
我做好这件
Here's one that I've finished, Roger.

678
01:05:14,380 --> 01:05:15,570
还有…
And, uh...

679
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:21,250
这是我用蓝墨水染的
here's one that I dyed with a bottle of blue ink.

680
01:05:22,390 --> 01:05:25,620
挺好看的 罗杰 什么事？
It's rather good. What's up, Roger?

681
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:28,690
如果警卫查到这些就大丰收了
The goons'd have a field day if they crashed in on this lot.

682
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:33,100
那是索伦负责的 我已经开始利用其他材料
That's Sorren's department. Now, I've started working on the other materials.

683
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,230
这床毯子
This blanket.

684
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:38,400
尤其是条纹 好极了
Particularly the stripes. Marvelous.

685
01:05:38,510 --> 01:05:39,740
-做外套？ -对
- Coats. - Yes.

686
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:42,840
我已经叫手下在营地各处动手
I've got the chaps working on these all over the compound.

687
01:05:42,850 --> 01:05:45,810
那些战斗服 恐怕稍微短了一点
Those battle dresses, I'm afraid they're a bit too short.

688
01:05:45,890 --> 01:05:50,790
我会叫手下把它们做成工人服之类
I'll have to get the chaps to make those into some sort of workingman's outfits.

689
01:05:50,860 --> 01:05:53,150
毯子布套
Blanket ticking.

690
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:58,070
我把它们做成漂亮的背心
Now, I've made these into rather nice little Waistcoats.

691
01:05:58,070 --> 01:06:01,660
-很师气 当然是染色的 -当然
- Very dapper, yes. Dyed, of course. - Of course.

692
01:06:01,740 --> 01:06:04,300
看看这个
Just take a look at this, Roger.

693
01:06:04,370 --> 01:06:09,570
我们把毯子到得很平滑
Now, this blanket material, we scrape this down until it's really smooth,

694
01:06:09,650 --> 01:06:11,940
然后用鞋油染色
and then dye it with boot polish.

695
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:16,040
韩德利弄来的灯心绒 但愿有更多这种衣料
Corduroy scrounged by Hendley. I wish we had more of this.

696
01:06:16,150 --> 01:06:19,090
-你从哪里弄到这些东西？ -是韩德利
- Where in God's name did you get these? - Hendley.

697
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,520
-他从哪里弄到的？ -我问过他
- Where did he get them? - I asked him that.

698
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:24,320
-他怎么说？ -他说“别问”
- What did he say? - "Don't ask."

699
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,460
给你看一些我正在做的大衣
Let me show you some of the overcoats I've been working on.

700
01:06:57,370 --> 01:06:59,360
-希尔兹 早安 -早
- Good morning, Hilts. - Uh-oh.

701
01:07:01,040 --> 01:07:04,240
如果你想知道我会不会再逃 我会
Well, if you're here to find out if I'm going out again, I am.

702
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,440
-什么时候？ -17天后 7月7日
- When? - Seventeen days, 7th of July.

703
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,380
-没有月光 -对
- Dark of the moon. - Correct.

704
01:07:08,450 --> 01:07:10,980
艾弗斯跟你一起逃吗？
- Is Ives going with you? -

705
01:07:11,050 --> 01:07:13,820
如果他要的话 可以
Yeah, if he wants to.

706
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:17,330
你知不知道艾弗斯快崩溃了？
You, uh... You know that Ives is close to cracking?

707
01:07:18,460 --> 01:07:20,430
知道
Yeah.

708
01:07:21,700 --> 01:07:25,130
最好让他用地道逃出去吗？ -比较安全
Better for him to go out in the tunnel, huh? - Safer.

709
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:32,070
有道理
Right.

710
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:38,050
单独行动有可能穿越铁丝网 甚至逃走
It's possible for one man to get out through the wire, even get away,

711
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:43,650
但是除了你之外 营地里还有很多人
but there are in fact a considerable number of people besides yourself

712
01:07:43,730 --> 01:07:46,060
正在试图逃走
in this camp who are trying to escape.

713
01:07:47,060 --> 01:07:49,050
我了解
I appreciate that.

714
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,640
有事情要发生了 我有感觉
Something's coming, I can feel it,

715
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,330
而且就要发生在我身上
and it's coming right around the corner at me, Squadron Leader.

716
01:07:57,440 --> 01:07:59,740
-我的名字是罗杰 -好的 罗杰
- My name's Roger. - All right, Roger.

717
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,310
你叫维吉吗？
Yours is Virgil, isn't it?

718
01:08:03,280 --> 01:08:06,080
希尔兹 叫我希尔兹好了
Hilts. Just make it Hilts.

719
01:08:07,190 --> 01:08:08,880
好 那么…
Yes, well, um...

720
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,420
希尔兹 我要说的是
as I was saying, uh, Hilts,

721
01:08:12,660 --> 01:08:15,590
我们有德国地图 普通的地图
we have maps of Germany, general maps, that is.

722
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:19,830
我们有逃离德国的全部资讯
We have all the information we need for the escape routes out of Germany.

723
01:08:19,900 --> 01:08:22,170
但是我们没有…
But what we do not have...

724
01:08:22,240 --> 01:08:25,730
树林外面五百公尺的详细情形
ls a clear idea of what's 500 yards beyond those trees.

725
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:28,740
我们试过营里每个警卫 全都失败
We've tried every goon in the camp. No go.

726
01:08:28,820 --> 01:08:32,610
我们必须知道 本地城镇的确切位置
We must know the exact position of the local town.

727
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,710
我们想知道 在哪里连接主要道路
We want to know where we hit the main roads.

728
01:08:35,760 --> 01:08:39,420
警察局在哪里 军事检查哨在哪里
Where the police stations are, where they've got their roadblocks.

729
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:44,050
最重要的是 我们必须知道如何从这里
And, most important of all, we've got to know how to get from here

730
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:46,620
去火车站
to the railway station.

731
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:50,160
绝对不行 我穿越铁丝网之后
No. Absolutely not. When I get through that wire,

732
01:08:50,210 --> 01:08:52,870
绝对不会帮你们画地图
I'm not gonna be making maps for you guys.

733
01:08:52,980 --> 01:08:58,610
我要远远逃走 就算他们用大炮打我 你们也听不见
I'm gonna be so far away, you won't hear if they're shooting at me with howitzers.

734
01:08:58,720 --> 01:09:01,550
-可以理解 -完全理解
- Understandable. - Completely.

735
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,390
我乐于帮忙 但是…
I mean, I'd like to help, but...

736
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:12,400
很有趣的主意
Interesting idea.

737
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:15,730
-你要带多少人出去？ -250人
- How many you taking out? - Two hundred and fifty.

738
01:09:18,410 --> 01:09:20,530
250人？
Two hundred and fifty?

739
01:09:21,010 --> 01:09:22,430
是的
Yeah.

740
01:09:23,110 --> 01:09:25,170
你疯了 该进疯人院 你也是
You're crazy. You too.

741
01:09:25,250 --> 01:09:28,780
250人大摇大摆走在路上？
Two hundred and fifty guys just walking down the road, just like that.

742
01:09:28,850 --> 01:09:32,810
有些走公路 有些格火车 还有一些走小路
Well, some on the road, some by train, some cross-country.

743
01:09:32,890 --> 01:09:35,290
他们有伪造证件 服装
They'll have forged papers, clothes,

744
01:09:35,360 --> 01:09:37,190
地图 罗盘 口粮
maps, compasses, rations.

745
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:40,420
想过你会引起全德国 所有警卫的注意吗？
You're gonna alert every goon in the country.

746
01:09:40,470 --> 01:09:43,490
连农人都会拿着草叉来找你
Anybody that can carry a pitchfork is gonna be out looking for you.

747
01:09:43,570 --> 01:09:48,570
他们会全面扫荡 很快将你们全抓起来
They're gonna swoop down and scoop you up so fast it'd make your head swim.

748
01:09:51,310 --> 01:09:53,280
多谢了
Yes, well, um, thanks, anyway.

749
01:09:53,420 --> 01:09:56,870
-如果地道要我帮忙 尽管说 -你真好
If I can help on the tunnel, let me know.

750
01:09:56,920 --> 01:09:58,820
听候差遣
- That's good of you. - Any time.

751
01:10:00,020 --> 01:10:05,490
等一下 你不是真的想我穿越铁丝网
Wait a minute. You aren't seriously suggesting that if I get through the wire

752
01:10:05,600 --> 01:10:08,620
弄清楚外面的情况 躲避追捕
and case everything out there and don't get picked up,

753
01:10:08,740 --> 01:10:11,600
然后回来自首关禁闭几个月
to turn myself in and get thrown back in the cooler

754
01:10:11,670 --> 01:10:14,140
好让你得到需要的资料？
so you can get the information you need?

755
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:18,910
是的 我的任务 使我不得不提出奇任的要求
Yes. One has to ask some very strange things in the job I have.

756
01:10:18,980 --> 01:10:22,250
-我们让你优先使用地道 -连我亲娘也别妄想
- We'll give you a front place. - I wouldn't do that for my own mother.

757
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,220
-我不怪你 -那么 请便
- I don't blame you. - Well, OK, then.

758
01:10:24,290 --> 01:10:27,220
-我们完全谅解你 -那么 请便
- It's completely understandable. - Well, OK, then.

759
01:10:29,730 --> 01:10:31,720
好吧 多谢了
Yes, well, thanks, Hilts.

760
01:10:39,100 --> 01:10:41,070
将军…
Check.

761
01:10:44,080 --> 01:10:45,750
韩德利 我…
- Herr Hendley, I...

762
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,340
不要紧 布莱斯是朋友
Oh, it's all right. Blythe's a friend.

763
01:10:51,320 --> 01:10:55,190
-韦纳 什么事？ -我的皮夹 证件 身份证
What's the matter, Werner? - My wallet, my papers, my identity card.

764
01:10:55,260 --> 01:10:58,520
不见了 我的东西全丢了
Gone. I lost them. Everything.

765
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,390
他的皮夹掉了
- He lost his wallet. - Hmm?

766
01:11:01,470 --> 01:11:04,960
如果斯特赫维兹发现了 你知道会怎样吗？
Do you realize what would happen if Strachwitz found this out?

767
01:11:05,100 --> 01:11:07,230
-去俄国前线 -太糟了
- The Russian front. - Dear, dear.

768
01:11:10,340 --> 01:11:13,000
我找遍每个地方
I've looked every place, every place.

769
01:11:13,780 --> 01:11:17,270
一定是在这里弄丢的
I must have lost them while I was in here.

770
01:11:17,460 --> 01:11:19,760
不会吧 -是的
- No. - Yes.

771
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:23,890
我说过我们是朋友 我们会替你找到的
Look, I told you we were friends. We'll find them.

772
01:11:23,890 --> 01:11:26,330
韩德利先生 谢谢你
Oh, thank you, Herr Hendley.

773
01:11:27,770 --> 01:11:29,490
韦纳
Werner.

774
01:11:29,630 --> 01:11:32,760
不是现在 如果有人看见你和我
Not now. It might look a little peculiar

775
01:11:32,770 --> 01:11:36,360
这么晚探头探脑 看起来有点奇怪
if you and I were seen probing around at this time of night.

776
01:11:38,180 --> 01:11:42,610
我保证会找到失物 就算折掉房子也要找到
Look, I'll find them. I promise you I'll find 'em if I have to tear this room apart.

777
01:11:49,240 --> 01:11:51,790
谢谢你 -别客气

01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,970
长官 谢谢你
Thank you, sir.

913
01:26:09,200 --> 01:26:11,190
丹尼！这一杯敬…
Danny! Here's to...

914
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:21,230
罗杰 警卫在105号营房
Roger, goons in 105.

915
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:24,070
-哪一个？ -斯特赫维兹
- Who? - Strachwitz.

916
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:32,280
我们必须装作若无其事 否则警卫就知道那里很重要
We have to ignore it. If we pay attention, the goons'll know the hut's important.

917
01:26:33,290 --> 01:26:35,280
祝回家
Here's to going home.

918
01:26:50,250 --> 01:26:53,540
丹尼 别紧张 他们搜过一百次了
Come on, Danny. They've searched it a hundred times.

919
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:55,620
回家！
Home!

920
01:27:08,270 --> 01:27:12,130
很高兴你和我们合作挖地道 敬汤姆 好吗？
Anyway, I'm glad we've got you in the tunnel with us. To Tom, eh?

921
01:27:14,740 --> 01:27:18,730
别担心 两星期后 你就会在亚吉尔进大街
Och, never mind. You'll be walking down Argyle Street in a couple of weeks.

922
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:23,620
敬汤姆 我现在才开始有那种感觉
To Tom. You know, Sandy, I'm just beginning to realize that myself.

923
01:27:23,720 --> 01:27:26,690
当然应该有那种感觉 我们几乎要到树林了
Why shouldn't you, man? We're nearly at the trees, boy.

924
01:27:26,790 --> 01:27:28,780
我们几乎要到树林了 是吗？
We're nearly at the trees, eh?

925
01:28:16,150 --> 01:28:18,170
士官长！
Herr Hauptfeldwebel! Herr Hauptfeldwebel!

926
01:28:37,080 --> 01:28:39,210
就这样
Das ist es also.

927
01:28:45,880 --> 01:28:47,840
去守着！
Los, holen Sie die Wache!

928
01:28:52,390 --> 01:28:56,390
我猜对了
Ich hab's doch geahnt.

929
01:28:59,200 --> 01:29:01,400
老天！他们发现汤姆了
Oh, my God! They've found Tom.

930
01:29:15,390 --> 01:29:17,290
地道被发现了
It's the tunnel.

931
01:29:34,110 --> 01:29:36,100
成功个鬼
Success.

932
01:29:59,980 --> 01:30:01,270
艾弗斯！
Ives!

933
01:30:04,170 --> 01:30:05,260
不许动！
Halt!

934
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:16,400
长官 请告诉我 你需要什么资料
Sir, let me know the exact information you need.

935
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,820
-我今晚逃出去 -好的
- I'm going out tonight. - Right.

936
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,530
打开 哈利
Open up, Harry.

937
01:31:24,540 --> 01:31:27,200
我们一天24小时挖掘
We dig. Around the clock.

938
01:33:05,020 --> 01:33:07,350
禁闭室 关就关
- Cooler. - Right.

939
01:33:10,790 --> 01:33:13,650
没想到他们这么快抓到他
Well, I didn't think they'd catch him so soon.

940
01:33:15,430 --> 01:33:17,590
他不是被抓到的
He wasn't caught.

941
01:33:31,180 --> 01:33:33,510
希尔兹 欢迎回家
Hilts, welcome home.

942
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:27,610
丹尼？
Danny?

943
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:31,810
丹尼？
Danny?

944
01:34:34,660 --> 01:34:36,650
丹尼？
Danny?

945
01:34:43,230 --> 01:34:45,200
丹尼 你没事吧？
Are you all right, Danny?

946
01:34:47,110 --> 01:34:49,070
没事
Yes.

947
01:34:49,210 --> 01:34:51,110
我没事
All right.

948
01:34:53,210 --> 01:34:56,270
拿铲子来 我没事
All right. Bring some shovels. I'm all right.

949
01:34:58,820 --> 01:35:01,450
老天爷 你满掉了整个飞鹰标志
For God's sake, you've left out a whole eagle.

950
01:35:01,520 --> 01:35:03,420
那不可能
That's impossible.

951
01:35:04,560 --> 01:35:06,550
是满掉了
Yes.

952
01:35:07,230 --> 01:35:10,200
四天的辛苦白费了！
Four days' work up the bloody spout!

953
01:35:11,330 --> 01:35:13,490
柯林 对不起
- I'm sorry, Colin. -

954
01:35:13,570 --> 01:35:15,560
史密斯 不要紧
It's all right, Smithy.

955
01:35:16,740 --> 01:35:20,680
已经很晚了 你去睡吧 我来收拾这里
It's getting late. You push off to bed. I'll pack up here.

956
01:35:20,750 --> 01:35:22,710
是的
All right.

957
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:25,410
-柯林 晚安 -史密斯 晚安
- Good night, Colin. - Good night, Smithy.

958
01:36:05,730 --> 01:36:08,060
我什么都看不见
I can't see a bloody thing.

959
01:36:13,750 --> 01:36:14,750
脱帽
Hut ab.

960
01:36:17,040 --> 01:36:19,300
很好 就这样 谢谢
Sehr gut. In Ordnung. Danke schön.

961
01:36:19,460 --> 01:36:21,460
请进
- Bitte schön. - Herein.

962
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:26,800
希特勒万岁
Heil Hitler.

963
01:36:28,850 --> 01:36:31,520
-你叫什么名字 -埃里希·斯崔尔 来自慕尼黑
- Wie heißen Sie? - Erich Stressel, aus München.

964
01:36:31,680 --> 01:36:32,680
你怎么在这里
Warum sind Sie hier?

965
01:36:32,850 --> 01:36:36,230
我请假了 我母亲生病了
Ich habe Urlaub bekommen. Meine Mutter ist krank.

966
01:36:36,540 --> 01:36:40,230
-你的德语很好 -谢谢 我花了很多…
- Your German's very good. - Thanks, Mac. I've put in a lot of...

967
01:36:40,480 --> 01:36:44,880
注意！那是最容易的一招 不要被那个老套招式骗到
Watch it. That's the easiest way to trip up a suspect. Don't fall for that old gag.

968
01:36:44,880 --> 01:36:47,470
-对不起 -记住永远说德语
- I'm sorry, Mac. - OK. But remember, German always.

969
01:36:47,700 --> 01:36:49,700
这里
Herein.

970
01:37:01,100 --> 01:37:05,040
1 2 3 4 5
One, two, three, four, five.

971
01:37:24,430 --> 01:37:25,490
罗杰
Roger.

972
01:37:30,640 --> 01:37:32,190
不是 是我
No, it's me.

973
01:37:34,510 --> 01:37:36,570
你喜不喜欢这套逃亡装？
How do you like the old escape suit?

974
01:37:36,680 --> 01:37:38,650
很好
Fine, fine.

975
01:37:40,980 --> 01:37:42,540
柯林
Colin.

976
01:37:45,250 --> 01:37:47,520
你喜欢我的吗？
How do you like mine?

977
01:37:47,690 --> 01:37:50,020
看起来好极了
It looks splendid.

978
01:38:16,430 --> 01:38:18,760
丹尼 你要去哪里？ 你会被枪毙的
Where are you going? You'll get yourself shot.

979
01:38:18,830 --> 01:38:22,960
-怎么回事？ -我要从铁丝网出去
- What's the matter with you? - I'm going out through that fence.

980
01:38:24,600 --> 01:38:28,200
丹尼 我们从地道出去 我就要出发了
Danny, we're getting out through the tunnel. We're almost clear.

981
01:38:28,270 --> 01:38:31,170
威利 别管我
Please, Willie, let me alone.

982
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:33,840
我无法再进那个地道
I can't go in that tunnel anymore.

983
01:38:33,910 --> 01:38:36,380
我要从铁丝网出去
So I'm going out through the wire.

984
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:43,790
丹尼 想清楚 我们要出去 但不是从铁丝网
Danny, think. We're getting out, but not through the wire.

985
01:38:43,860 --> 01:38:47,020
我们要从地道出去 地道已经完工了
We're getting out through the tunnel. It's finished.

986
01:38:47,100 --> 01:38:49,220
-我现在就出去 -不要
- I go out now. - No.

987
01:38:50,270 --> 01:38:53,630
丹尼 你从铁丝网出去 会被射杀
Danny, you go through that wire and you'll get killed.

988
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:02,830
不要那样
Don't do that.

989
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:07,040
威利…
Willie...

990
01:39:08,690 --> 01:39:10,920
从我小时候
Since I was a boy,

991
01:39:11,060 --> 01:39:15,500
我就讨厌…而且害怕小房间
I hate... and feared little rooms,

992
01:39:15,570 --> 01:39:17,790
橱柜 山洞
closets, caves.

993
01:39:17,870 --> 01:39:20,330
丹尼 你挖过17条地道 不只17条地道
Danny, you've dug 17 tunnels. Over 17 tunnels.

994
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:22,800
我必须逃出去
Because I must get out.

995
01:39:22,870 --> 01:39:26,070
我藏起恐惧 努力挖掘
I hide the fear, and I dig.

996
01:39:27,110 --> 01:39:31,210
但是明天晚上在地道里 有这么多人
But tomorrow night in the tunnel with all those men,

997
01:39:31,280 --> 01:39:33,840
我怕这次会丧失理智
I'm afraid maybe this time I will lose my head,

998
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:36,820
毁了大家的计划
and ruin the escape for everybody.

999
01:39:39,590 --> 01:39:41,580
所以我现在就逃
So I go now.

1000
01:39:46,230 --> 01:39:49,200
丹尼 我会照顾你穿过地道
Danny, I'll see you through the tunnel.

1001
01:39:50,840 --> 01:39:54,300
我会照顾你 我会一路跟着你
I'll look after you. I'll stick with you all the way.

1002
01:39:55,590 --> 01:39:57,560
好吧
All right.

1003
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:07,780
-晚安 -哈啰 罗杰
- Good evening. - Hello, Roger.

1004
01:40:08,630 --> 01:40:11,110
你认为我们看起来怎样？
Well, how do you think we look?

1005
01:40:11,110 --> 01:40:11,120
先生 晚上好 您好吗
Guten Abend, mein Herr. Wie geht es Ihnen?
你认为我们看起来怎样？
Well, how do you think we look?

1006
01:40:11,120 --> 01:40:14,610
先生 晚上好 您好吗
Guten Abend, mein Herr. Wie geht es Ihnen?

1007
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:16,630
我德语那么糟吗？
It's as bad as all that?

1008
01:40:16,740 --> 01:40:23,370
柯林 我首先要说如果没有你 我们就不能准备好
Colin, I want first of all to say that without you, we would not have been ready.

1009
01:40:23,450 --> 01:40:27,110
别客气 我有很多帮手 很多很好的帮手
That's all right. I had lots of help. Lots of very good help.

1010
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:30,940
罗杰 什么事？
What's the matter, Roger?

1011
01:40:31,920 --> 01:40:34,290
你不能参加逃脱
You can't go.

1012
01:40:34,830 --> 01:40:37,320
-你是什么意思？ -我不能让你出去
- What do you mean? - I can't allow it.

1013
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:40,850
-为什么？ 你连眼前的手都看不见
Why? You can't see your hand in front of your face.

1014
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:43,590
你逃不出十公尺就会被抓到
You'd be caught before you got 10 yards.

1015
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,700
那太可笑了
That's ridiculous.

1016
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:50,100
那太可笑了 我从没听过这么荒谬的事
That's ridiculous. Never heard anything so absurd in my life.

1017
01:40:50,210 --> 01:40:53,580
我视力没问题
I can see perfectly. I can see perfectly!

1018
01:40:54,420 --> 01:40:57,850
我能够看见…那边那根针
I can see... that pin down there.

1019
01:40:57,920 --> 01:41:00,580
-你满意了吗？ 什么针？在哪里？
- Does that satisfy you? - What pin? Where?

1020
01:41:12,370 --> 01:41:15,740
柯林 你看见门槛吗？
Colin, do you see the foot of the door?

1021
01:41:16,880 --> 01:41:18,240
当然看见了
Yes, of course.

1022
01:41:20,420 --> 01:41:23,510
把这根针放在那里 好吗？
Put the pin down there, will you?

1023
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:25,090
可以
All right.

1024
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:31,030
没事了 过来
All right. Come on.

1025
01:41:31,860 --> 01:41:33,850
过来 坐下
Come on. Sit down.

1026
01:41:35,500 --> 01:41:38,060
坐下 你努力试过了
Sit down. It was a good try.

1027
01:41:39,470 --> 01:41:43,310
我不想最后一刻让你失望 但是有人告诉我
I hate these last-minute letdowns, but I've only just been told.

1028
01:41:43,380 --> 01:41:47,210
-太冒险了 -你不认为要让柯林来决定吗？
It's too risky for you. - Don't you think that's Colin's decision?

1029
01:41:47,280 --> 01:41:49,480
-我不认为 -罗杰 别这样
- No, I don't. - Come on, Roger.

1030
01:41:49,550 --> 01:41:55,010
我们都知道是怎么回事 至少…大部份人知道
We all know the score here. Well, at least... most of us do.

1031
01:41:55,090 --> 01:41:58,360
这次逃脱的构想 是开辟另一条战线
Your idea of this escape is to start another front,

1032
01:41:58,460 --> 01:42:02,800
在防线后方扰乱德国人 没关系 那样很好
to foul up the Germans behind the lines. All right, that's fine.

1033
01:42:02,870 --> 01:42:07,430
但是只要我们越过铁丝网 迫使他们到处寻找我们
But once we get past that wire and have them looking all over Germany for us,

1034
01:42:07,510 --> 01:42:09,970
任务就完成了
that mission is accomplished.

1035
01:42:10,040 --> 01:42:13,340
完成任务之后 我们有自己的想法
Afterwards, we have some ideas of our own.

1036
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:16,350
你是说回家？
You mean getting home?

1037
01:42:16,420 --> 01:42:18,850
回到家人身边？ -对
- Back to your family? - That's right.

1038
01:42:19,020 --> 01:42:22,360
你真的以为我不想回家吗？
Do you really believe I haven't thought about that, too?

1039
01:42:22,360 --> 01:42:24,350
我相信你想
I'm sure you have.

1040
01:42:25,530 --> 01:42:27,520
我知道柯林想
I know Colin has.

1041
01:42:28,570 --> 01:42:30,720
我也想
And, Roger, I have, too.

1042
01:42:30,830 --> 01:42:32,820
我们认为能够一路逃回去
We think we can make it all the way.

1043
01:42:32,970 --> 01:42:37,740
柯林不能 他会严重危害整个计划 必须由我来决定
Not Colin. He'd be an appalling hazard to the escape. That must be my decision.

1044
01:42:37,880 --> 01:42:42,070
让我们来谈谈危害 先谈谈你
Let's talk about hazard. Let's talk about you.

1045
01:42:42,080 --> 01:42:46,020
你是我们最大的危害 秘密警察已经锁定你了
You're the biggest hazard we have. The Gestapo has you marked.

1046
01:42:47,620 --> 01:42:49,920
但是没人说你不可以逃
No one has said you can't go.

1047
01:42:51,390 --> 01:42:53,050
你说的对
That's true.

1048
01:42:54,030 --> 01:42:56,360
我已经考虑到秘密警察
I have thought about the Gestapo.

1049
01:42:58,440 --> 01:43:02,530
但是如果你问我 -个指挥官可以做或者胆敢做
But if you're asking me how far a commanding officer is allowed to go,

1050
01:43:02,740 --> 01:43:04,710
多大的冒险
or dare go,

1051
01:43:05,610 --> 01:43:08,480
或者他可不可以纷演上帝？
or should be permitted to play God,

1052
01:43:09,480 --> 01:43:11,450
我无法回答你
I can't answer you.

1053
01:43:12,750 --> 01:43:14,580
但是我能够告诉你
But I can tell you

1054
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:18,790
盲人对于自己和整个计划 都是不必要的危害
a blind man is an unnecessary hazard to himself and the whole plan,

1055
01:43:18,790 --> 01:43:21,820
必须排除在逃亡计划之外
and must therefore be eliminated from the operation.

1056
01:43:32,780 --> 01:43:38,010
柯林和我一起就不是盲人 他会和我一起
Colin's not a blind man as long as he's with me, and he's going with me.

1057
01:43:44,060 --> 01:43:46,320
柯林 你愿意吗？
It's all right with you, Colin?

1058
01:43:48,330 --> 01:43:50,990
很愿意
Oh, yes. Quite.

1059
01:43:58,570 --> 01:44:04,440
很好 我会安排你和柯林一起逃脱
Very well. I'll arrange for your escape numbers to be altered accordingly.

1060
01:44:05,320 --> 01:44:07,300
俩位 晚安
Good night, gentlemen.

1061
01:44:14,160 --> 01:44:16,130
其实…
Actually...

1062
01:44:17,300 --> 01:44:19,530
他说的很对
he's quite right.

1063
01:44:19,600 --> 01:44:21,590
他说的完全正确
He's completely right.

1064
01:44:22,200 --> 01:44:24,290
我真的不应该逃
I really shouldn't go at all.

1065
01:44:24,370 --> 01:44:27,810
我的视力最近愈来愈差
My eyes have been getting worse and worse lately.

1066
01:44:27,910 --> 01:44:31,310
这好像叫作恶性近视
I think they call it progressive myopia.

1067
01:44:31,850 --> 01:44:34,910
我能看见这么近的东西
I can see things up here. Close to.

1068
01:44:34,980 --> 01:44:37,470
我能够用眼力工作 但是…
I can see to work, but, uh...

1069
01:44:40,330 --> 01:44:42,790
看你只是一团模糊
- you're just a blur.

1070
01:44:42,890 --> 01:44:44,860
我知道
I know.

1071
01:44:45,630 --> 01:44:48,030
管它的 我们会很顺利的
Oh, hell. We'll make it in great shape.

1072
01:44:48,370 --> 01:44:50,390
柯林 你有茶吗？
Colin, do you have any tea?

1073
01:44:51,570 --> 01:44:54,230
-当然有 -我们喝一点
- Yes, of course. - Then let's have some.

1074
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,740
好极了
Splendid.

1075
01:45:16,710 --> 01:45:17,710
出去
Raus.

1076
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:45,800
希尔兹
- Hi, Hilts.

01:45:45,870 --> 01:45:47,860
麦克
Hey, Mac.

1078
01:45:50,140 --> 01:45:51,630
什么时候？
When?

1079
01:45:51,750 --> 01:45:54,410
今天晚上 以为他们永远不放你出来
Tonight. We thought they'd never let you out.

1080
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:57,000
我也以为是 我们谈正事吧
Me, too. Let's get at it.

1081
01:45:57,150 --> 01:45:59,980
巴特利在等你 -我会到的
- Bartlett's waiting for you. - I'll be there.

1082
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:12,300
现在什么时间？
What time?

1083
01:47:14,480 --> 01:47:16,570
丹尼 只剩八分钟了
Only eight minutes now, Danny.

1084
01:47:20,690 --> 01:47:22,670
你没事吧？
You OK?

1085
01:47:32,900 --> 01:47:34,800
卡文迪斯
Cavendish.

1086
01:47:34,870 --> 01:47:36,360
葛里夫 去那边
Griff, down there.

1087
01:47:36,470 --> 01:47:38,440
戈福 去那边
Goff, there.

1088
01:47:58,300 --> 01:48:01,360
史密斯 福尔斯 右边第三床
Smith, Foles, third on the right.

1089
01:48:02,170 --> 01:48:05,400
布莱斯 韩德利 左边第三床
Blythe, Hendley, third on the left.

1090
01:48:35,240 --> 01:48:36,730
灯亮了
There are the lights.

1091
01:48:38,510 --> 01:48:40,850
丹尼 分秒不差
Right on the tick, Danny.

1092
01:48:50,160 --> 01:48:53,220
丹尼 顺着地道看 它真美
Look down the tunnel, Danny. It's lovely.

1093
01:48:55,740 --> 01:48:59,230
像是旅游旺季的黑潭海滨
It's just like Blackpool at the height of the season.

1094
01:49:01,040 --> 01:49:03,670
丹尼 你去过黑潭吗？
You ever been to Blackpool, Danny?

1095
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:05,510
去过
Yes.

1096
01:49:05,610 --> 01:49:07,600
没去过
No.

1097
01:49:08,350 --> 01:49:10,340
我不知道
I don't know.

1098
01:49:13,860 --> 01:49:15,820
罗杰 时间到了
It's time, Roger.

1099

巴特利 麦居纳 艾希利皮特
Bartlett, MacDonald, Ashley-Pitt.

1100
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:36,770
长官 可以走了
It's all clear, sir.

1101
01:49:45,730 --> 01:49:47,660
罗杰 全准备好了
All set, Roger.

1102
01:50:00,110 --> 01:50:01,940
罗杰
Roger.

1103
01:50:02,020 --> 01:50:03,980
祝好运
Good luck.

1104
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:36,410
丹尼 他们正从竖坑下来
They're coming down the shaft now, Danny.

1105
01:50:36,490 --> 01:50:39,990
然后他们会顺着地道过来
And then they'll be coming right up the tunnel.

1106
01:50:46,080 --> 01:50:48,140
威利…
Willie...

1107
01:50:48,320 --> 01:50:51,490
我不能等了 我必须出去
I can't wait. I must get out.

1108
01:50:51,800 --> 01:50:55,400
丹尼！丹尼！
Danny! Danny! Danny! Danny!

1109
01:51:23,360 --> 01:51:26,850
丹尼 什么事？ 丹尼！过来！
What is it, Danny? What's the matter? Danny! Come here!

1110
01:51:27,540 --> 01:51:30,630
罗杰 丹尼和我等一下才走 我们消卜后一点
Roger? Danny and I'll go later. We'll take another place.

1111
01:51:30,810 --> 01:51:33,880
丹尼 告诉我怎么回事 快点！
Danny, tell me what this is, and tell me quickly!

1112
01:51:33,890 --> 01:51:37,850
这地道是大家的也是我的 我挖的 我造的
This tunnel is mine as much as anybody. I dug it. I built it.

1113
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:40,370
我被埋过很多次 我想走就走
I was buried many times. I go when I want.

1114
01:51:40,440 --> 01:51:42,410
让我出去 让我出去
Let me out. Let me out.

1115
01:51:45,820 --> 01:51:48,160
威利 带他出去
Take him out, Willie. Take him out.

1116
01:52:03,210 --> 01:52:05,180
丹尼？怎么回事？
Danny? What is it?

1117
01:52:05,610 --> 01:52:07,810
丹尼 出了什么事？
Danny, what's going on?

1118
01:52:07,820 --> 01:52:11,060
塞奇威克 没事 我们等一会再走
It's all right, Sedgwick. It's all right. We're going later.

1119
01:52:17,550 --> 01:52:20,280
丹尼 没事的
Danny, it's all right. It's all right.

1120
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:24,260
我们可以排后一点 没事的
We can take another place in the line. It's all right.

1121
01:52:24,970 --> 01:52:26,960
柯林 该你下去
All right, Colin. Down you go.

1122
01:52:27,610 --> 01:52:32,390
坐下用右脚找梯子的第一级 找到了吗？
Sit down. Feel the top rung of the ladder with your right foot. Got it?

1123
01:52:32,490 --> 01:52:34,460
向下爬
Down you go.

1124
01:52:49,740 --> 01:52:51,840
丹尼退出吗？
Danny cut out, huh?

1125
01:52:51,880 --> 01:52:54,550
威利带他上去 希尔兹 我…
Willie took him up top. Hilts, I, uh...

1126
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,390
-记住 别挂头 -好的
- Remember, keep your head down. - Right.

1127
01:53:36,120 --> 01:53:38,120
巴勒特
Psst. Bartlett.

1128
01:54:17,120 --> 01:54:18,860
如何
All right?

1129
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:22,700
-慢慢来 糟了 差了6公尺 -是什么意思？
Hold onto yourself. You're 20 feet short. - What do you mean?

1130
01:54:22,780 --> 01:54:25,610
差6公尺才到树林 地道出口在空地上
Twenty feet short of the woods. The hole is in the open.

1131
01:54:25,720 --> 01:54:28,210
警卫在我们和探照灯之间
The guard is between us and the lights.

1132
01:54:28,260 --> 01:54:30,120
怎么会这样？
How could that happen?

1133
01:54:30,230 --> 01:54:33,730
现在争论也没意思 生米已经煮成熟饭
What the hell difference does it make? It's happened.

1134
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:50,720
-罗杰… -别吵 我要想一想！
- Roger... - Damn it, Mac! I'm trying to think!

1135
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:53,530
我们可以延期 挖到树林
We could postpone it.

1136
01:54:53,630 --> 01:54:56,940
所有文件日期都是今天 时机一去不回
All the documents are dated today. It's now or never.

1137
01:55:00,990 --> 01:55:05,860
只有一个机会 趁警卫走到那边时逃出去
One chance. When the guard goes to the far end, you might be able to move out.

1138
01:55:06,000 --> 01:55:10,170
我能跑进树林用信号通知你们
I think I can make it to the woods, set up a signal when you're clear.

1139
01:55:10,180 --> 01:55:11,340
瞭望塔怎么办？
What about the towers?

1140
01:55:11,380 --> 01:55:14,880
必须冒险 他们监看的是营地 不是树林
They're gonna be watching the compound, not the woods.

1141
01:55:19,270 --> 01:55:21,800
麦克 传话下去 送十公尺的绳子过来
Mac, pass the word. Send down 30 feet of rope.

1142
01:55:22,580 --> 01:55:24,380
送十公尺的绳子过来！
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1143
01:55:26,130 --> 01:55:28,720
送十公尺的绳子过来
Send down 30 feet of rope.

1144
01:55:30,400 --> 01:55:32,430
送十公尺的绳子过来！
Send down 30 feet of rope!

1145
01:55:32,580 --> 01:55:34,270
-什么？ -十公尺的绳子！
- What? - Thirty feet of rope!

1146
01:55:34,280 --> 01:55:37,980
-要绳子做什么？ -我怎么知道？快拿绳子来
- What do they want that for? - How should I know? Get the rope.

1147
01:55:52,940 --> 01:55:57,440
-情况怎样？听说了吗？ -长官 我猜是出了麻烦
- How's it going? Have you heard? - Some kind of foul-up, I think, sir.

1148
01:55:57,480 --> 01:56:01,430
-他们还没进入地道吗？ -长官 还没有
Haven't they moved into the tunnel yet? - I don't think so, sir.

1149
01:56:23,930 --> 01:56:25,920
他进树林了
He's over there.

1150
01:56:31,980 --> 01:56:33,950
好 艾利克 你先上
Right. You go first, Eric.

1151
01:56:35,230 --> 01:56:37,700
我在这里等到一切顺利进行
I'm staying here till we get moving.

1152
01:56:48,930 --> 01:56:51,300
毕卡第利大街见 -史考特酒吧
- See you in Piccadilly. - Scott's Bar.

1153
01:56:51,900 --> 01:56:53,320
好
Right.

1154
01:57:05,810 --> 01:57:07,210
谢谢你
Thank you.

1155
01:57:07,280 --> 01:57:09,250
-祝好运 -好的
- Good luck. - Right.

1156
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:36,170
该我们了
We're moving.

1157
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:47,090
丹尼 他们在通过地道 他们正在逃出去
Danny, they're moving through the tunnel now. They're getting out.

1158
01:57:49,540 --> 01:57:55,280
华沙沦陷时 你是飞行员 逃到英国
When Warsaw fell, you escaped and came to England because you're a flier.

1159
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:59,530
你逃过来是想与我们一起 在天空对德军战斗
You came because you wanted to fly with us and fight the Germans.

1160
01:57:59,700 --> 01:58:02,700
我们现在能够逃出去 可以回到英国
We can get out now. We can get back to England.

1161
01:58:04,420 --> 01:58:06,610
如果你不从地道逃走
If you don't go through that tunnel,

1162
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:10,790
你做过的每一件事都会变成无意义！
everything you've done will have been for nothing, nothing!

1163
01:58:39,420 --> 01:58:41,390
-麦克 布莱斯在后面 -知道了
- Blythe's behind, Mac. - Right.

1164
01:58:43,930 --> 01:58:45,900
柯林 来这里
- In here, Colin. - Come on.

1165
01:58:46,440 --> 01:58:48,410
坐下
Sit down.

1166
01:58:53,220 --> 01:58:55,560
塞奇威克 该你了 我来接手
You're up, Sedgwick. I'll take over.

1167
01:58:59,070 --> 01:59:02,450
里面装了什么？钢琴吗？ -你真会说笑
- What have you got in here? A piano? - That's very funny, mate.

1168
01:59:02,450 --> 01:59:05,350
-这东西过不了地道 -我自有办法
- You won't get this thing through. - I'll cope.

1169
01:59:09,100 --> 01:59:12,230
塞奇威克和他的箱子吗？ -还会是谁
- Was that Sedgwick with his trunk? - Who else?

1170
01:59:12,310 --> 01:59:14,510
真希望他留在澳洲陪袋鼠
I wish he was home with his kangaroos.

1171
01:59:21,370 --> 01:59:23,100
-地道短了6公尺 -什么鬼…？
- We're 20 feet short. - How the hell...?

1172
01:59:23,280 --> 01:59:27,390
短了6公尺 希尔兹在树林里 控制绳子的另一端
Hilts is on the other end of that rope in the woods.

1173
01:59:27,390 --> 01:59:32,030
感觉绳子拉两下时就出去 让柯林趴下
As soon as you feel a couple of tugs, off you go, but keep Colin low.

1174
01:59:33,070 --> 01:59:35,040
-柯林 祝好运 -麦克 多谢
- Good luck, Colin. - Thanks, Mac.

1175
01:59:45,170 --> 01:59:47,170
那是什么声音？

Think they've been shooting them as they came out?

我用鞋油染色来遮住
I dyed it with boot polish to cover some oil smears

1264
02:23:43,850 --> 02:23:46,140
我被击落时沾到的油污

发动机起动后 不要动 否则你就会投上螺旋浆
When the engine catches, don't move, or you'll get a mouth full of propeller.

1429
02:50:09,610 --> 02:50:11,600
长官
Sir.

1430
02:50:18,220 --> 02:50:19,700
希尔兹 接住！
Hey, Hilts!
