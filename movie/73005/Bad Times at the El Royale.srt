1
00:05:41,339 --> 00:05:43,512
Are you lost, Father?

2
00:05:47,512 --> 00:05:49,914
Sorry?

3
00:05:49,915 --> 00:05:51,415
Are you lost?

4
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:52,416
No.

5
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,555
I suppose not.

6
00:05:56,555 --> 00:06:00,492
According to this, I am in Nevada.

7
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:06,097
I've never been to Nevada before.

8
00:06:06,098 --> 00:06:07,597
What's it like?

9
00:06:07,598 --> 00:06:09,036
Oh... It's not bad.

10
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:12,507
Looks like it might rain.

11
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,741
What's California like these days?

12
00:06:16,742 --> 00:06:17,742
Well...

13
00:06:21,113 --> 00:06:22,113
still sunny.

14
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:25,083
Can I give you a hand there?

15
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:26,818
That's very kind of you.

16
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:27,819
Thank you.

17
00:06:54,745 --> 00:06:56,745
Oh!

18
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,423
Please.

19
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:11,232
How are you enjoying Nevada so far?

20
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:14,965
So far, so good.

21
00:07:14,966 --> 00:07:17,301
Those are my accouterments.

22
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:20,564
Over there by the front desk.

23
00:07:21,005 --> 00:07:23,708
That's my trunk. That's my fortnighter.

24
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,177
That's my hat case.

25
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,910
And I would ask you folk...

26
00:07:26,911 --> 00:07:28,345
to please respect my claim

27
00:07:28,346 --> 00:07:31,982
when it comes time to divvyin' up the rooms.

28
00:07:31,983 --> 00:07:34,751
But when that'll be is anybody's guess.

29
00:07:34,752 --> 00:07:38,189
Been ringin' that dang bell so much my hand is tired.

30
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,657
My ears are sore.

31
00:07:39,658 --> 00:07:41,258
And my constitution needs coffee.

32
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:43,630
That's why I was scratchin' around back there.

33
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,097
I did find some...

34
00:07:46,098 --> 00:07:48,569
though I can't vouch for the quality.

35
00:07:50,569 --> 00:07:52,837
Laramie Seymour Sullivan.

36
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:55,674
Sales manager, Calhoun Appliances.

37
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,575
My name might not be on the masthead there...

38
00:07:57,576 --> 00:07:59,643
but that don't mean we aren't a family business.

39
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:00,644
Ma'am.

40
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:00,977
Hello.

41
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:02,946
And what may I call you, Father?

42
00:08:02,947 --> 00:08:05,650
Daniel Flynn. Nice to meet you.

43
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,318
Oh, Father Flynn. That's easy to remember.

44
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,388
Alliterative and such.

45
00:08:10,389 --> 00:08:12,090
Whereabouts is your parish?

46
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:15,661
The Immaculate Heart of Mary's in Bloomington, Indiana.

47
00:08:16,661 --> 00:08:18,129
Well, let me just say up front that myself

48
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,830
and the good people of East Biloxi Baptist...

49
00:08:19,831 --> 00:08:21,866
may have our differences with your pope...

50
00:08:21,867 --> 00:08:23,234
but I do believe we all carry

51
00:08:23,235 --> 00:08:25,970
the divinity of Jesus Christ in our hearts.

52
00:08:25,971 --> 00:08:28,875
And that makes us brothers as far as I'm concerned.

53
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:31,241
You're more than welcome to give that bell a whirl

54
00:08:31,242 --> 00:08:32,576
if you'd like.

55
00:08:32,577 --> 00:08:35,180
You might have better luck than I did.

56
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:36,781
So what about you, darlin'?

57
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:38,749
Are you in the hospitality business?

58
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,585
I do not work in the hospitality business, no.

59
00:08:41,586 --> 00:08:44,721
Well, I am going to give you my card anyway.

60
00:08:44,722 --> 00:08:48,163
I bet you know some gals who just might need a vacuum.

61
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:07,512
Your first time at the El Royale?

62
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,879
Ooh.

63
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:10,882
Well, it wasn't always like this.

64
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:12,282
And I don't just mean

65
00:09:12,283 --> 00:09:14,219
you could find a clerk come check-in time.

66
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,820
No, no, no.

67
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,657
This place used to be hustlin' and bustlin'.

68
00:09:19,658 --> 00:09:21,692
Tahoe's best-kept secret.

69
00:09:21,693 --> 00:09:23,359
I mean it was always a bit of a novelty,

70
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,762
yeah, sure, of course.

71
00:09:24,763 --> 00:09:26,431
But there's state fair novelty

72
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,166
and then there's old horse novelty.

73
00:09:29,167 --> 00:09:33,939
And I believe we are firmly in the old horse variety.

74
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,643
Yessir! 1966, this place had swing.

75
00:09:38,644 --> 00:09:40,945
Hell, I don't even think I could get a room here

76
00:09:40,946 --> 00:09:43,413
in the main lodge if I tried.

77
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:49,287
It was a hidey-hole for the Tahoe swells, you know?

78
00:09:49,288 --> 00:09:52,123
Old Dean Martin even sang a song about it.

79
00:09:52,124 --> 00:09:54,358
"Half in California with Judy."

80
00:09:54,359 --> 00:09:55,692
No?

81
00:09:55,693 --> 00:09:57,829
Well, wasn't one of his best. Coffee?

82
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,830
Oh, no, thank you.

83
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,330
Oh, come on, girl.

84
00:09:59,331 --> 00:10:02,566
I made a whole pot. Shame for it to go to waste.

85
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:03,887
There you go.

86
00:10:04,035 --> 00:10:05,101
Atta girl.

87
00:10:05,102 --> 00:10:07,204
I'll let the clerk give you the whole spiel

88
00:10:07,205 --> 00:10:09,641
if he ever shows up again, that is.

89
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,175
But the thing they always leave out...

90
00:10:11,176 --> 00:10:12,777
is that this place lost its gambling license

91
00:10:12,778 --> 00:10:15,379
about a year ago.

92
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:17,816
Something to do with the commission or some such.

93
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:20,817
So all the swells took their business elsewhere.

94
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:22,954
Now the main lodge is all that's open.

95
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:25,322
The pool is filled with ducks.

96
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,391
And they'll even rent you a room by the hour

97
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:28,625
if you ask real quietlike.

98
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,626
There you go, Father.

99
00:10:28,626 --> 00:10:30,595
Thank you.

100
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,162
Mmm-hmm. Although if we're bein' honest...

101
00:10:32,163 --> 00:10:33,730
that's probably the only reason that a priest,

102
00:10:33,731 --> 00:10:35,066
a vacuum salesman, and a negro...

103
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,668
could afford freight here, am I right?

104
00:10:37,669 --> 00:10:39,070
I'm just funnin'.

105
00:10:39,071 --> 00:10:42,105
Truth be told, my stay is on Calhoun Appliances...

106
00:10:42,106 --> 00:10:44,841
which is why room choice is so important to me...

107
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:47,543
and why I ask you to respect my accoutrement

108
00:10:47,544 --> 00:10:49,346
as proxy to my person.

109
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:52,383
I intend to lavish myself.

110
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:54,819
I always wanted to stay in the honeymoon suite...

111
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,557
although I'm not currently on my honeymoon.

112
00:11:10,434 --> 00:11:12,604
The lady's got a harder hand than we do, Father.

113
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,276
Oh...

114
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:22,379
I am very sorry to keep you waiting.

115
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:25,917
Damn, boy, where you been?

116
00:11:25,918 --> 00:11:28,153
Waitin' in this lobby so long, I could use a shave.

117
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,154
What's wrong with you?

118
00:11:29,155 --> 00:11:30,821
I am very sorry.

119
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:36,405
What are you doing here, Father?

120
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:42,566
Do I know you, son?

121
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:48,571
No. But, I mean, this is not a place for a priest, Father.

122
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:50,240
You shouldn't be here.

123
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:53,310
We might need to work on your sales pitch, son.

124
00:11:53,311 --> 00:11:56,413
"The El Royale, no place for a priest."

125
00:11:56,414 --> 00:11:58,950
There are other hotels, Father.

126
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:01,786
Maybe closer to Tahoe. I could help you find one.

127
00:12:01,787 --> 00:12:03,720
I'm sure you would be happier there.

128
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:05,721
Uh, Miles, is it?

129
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:05,422
Mmm-hmm.

130
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:08,859
If this is not a place for a priest, Miles...

131
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:11,030
then this is exactly where the Lord wants me.

132
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:14,931
Well, the Lord don't want you in the honeymoon suite.

133
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:16,166
I can promise you that.

134
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,903
Miles, those are my accoutrement there

135
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:21,138
and I stake my claim as such.

136
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:22,806
But you can go ahead and check them in first.

137
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:24,076
I don't mind.

138
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:27,345
It's all right, son.

139
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,479
Come on, boy.

140
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,281
Give him the whole spiel.

141
00:12:30,282 --> 00:12:33,025
The El Royale. And blah, blah, blah.

142
00:12:44,696 --> 00:12:48,499
The El Royale is a bi-state establishment.

143
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,901
You have the option to stay

144
00:12:49,902 --> 00:12:52,903
in either the great state of California...

145
00:12:52,904 --> 00:12:56,072
or the great state of Nevada.

146
00:12:56,073 --> 00:12:58,942
Warmth and sunshine to the west...

147
00:12:58,943 --> 00:13:03,549
or hope and opportunity to the east.

148
00:13:04,549 --> 00:13:06,418
Which would you prefer?

149
00:13:07,418 --> 00:13:09,853
What's the difference?

150
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:12,657
Between California and Nevada?

151
00:13:12,658 --> 00:13:14,992
Between the rooms.

152
00:13:14,993 --> 00:13:16,359
Well, for starters,

153
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,195
rooms in California cost a dollar more.

154
00:13:18,196 --> 00:13:20,330
Really? When did that happen?

155
00:13:20,331 --> 00:13:22,168
What makes 'em a dollar better?

156
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:25,903
They're in California.

157
00:13:25,904 --> 00:13:28,538
And that's worth a dollar?

158
00:13:28,539 --> 00:13:30,106
Some people think so.

159
00:13:30,107 --> 00:13:31,908
You got a phone number for any of those people?

160
00:13:31,909 --> 00:13:33,143
'Cause I sure would like to sell them

161
00:13:33,144 --> 00:13:35,846
one of these vacuum cleaners.

162
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:37,181
Hey, speaking of which,

163
00:13:37,182 --> 00:13:39,022
who handles your hospitality here at the hotel?

164
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:42,487
Currently, that is also me.

165
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,754
Oh, well...

166
00:13:44,755 --> 00:13:46,090
Shit.

167
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,425
We'll have to worry about that later.

168
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,528
May I see a map of the hotel, please?

169
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:51,967
Mmm-hmm.

170
00:13:55,967 --> 00:13:59,503
Only the main lodge is available in the off-season.

171
00:13:59,504 --> 00:14:01,839
You could still use the California amenities

172
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:04,441
if you choose to stay in Nevada.

173
00:14:04,442 --> 00:14:06,978
What exactly is a California amenity?

174
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,412
Uh, for instance,

175
00:14:08,413 --> 00:14:10,781
we're not allowed to sell liquor in Nevada.

176
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:12,148
So if we wanna drink,

177
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:13,683
we gotta do it on that side of the room?

178
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:15,552
That is correct, sir.

179
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:19,123
Also, coffee is 25 cents a cup.

180
00:14:19,124 --> 00:14:22,859
Let me guess. You're also the bartender?

181
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:24,295
That is correct, sir.

182
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,131
All right. Well...

183
00:14:28,131 --> 00:14:29,499
Feel free to flip that

184
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,268
if you need to make a decision, Father.

185
00:14:31,269 --> 00:14:33,309
Startin' to cost me money waitin' around this place.

186
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,907
Oh.

187
00:14:50,855 --> 00:14:53,757
Four. I'll take room four.

188
00:14:53,758 --> 00:14:57,427
I'll need one night in advance. Eight dollars.

189
00:14:57,428 --> 00:14:59,605
And it's 25 cents for the coffee.

190
00:15:07,605 --> 00:15:09,086
Please sign the ledger.

191
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:23,524
Who's next?

192
00:15:27,524 --> 00:15:30,936
May I have a room in Nevada please, Miles?

193
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,273
Room five.

194
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,139
Um, is there another room available?

195
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,675
Possibly further away?

196
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:47,845
Uh, those rooms have not been serviced and are unsuitable.

197
00:15:47,846 --> 00:15:50,681
He also does the housekeeping, remember?

198
00:15:50,682 --> 00:15:53,584
There are rooms in California available, ma'am.

199
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,119
Miles, she don't wanna be near the priest.

200
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,388
It's not like we didn't see her walkin' in here...

201
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,791
with her own bed rolls under her arms.

202
00:16:00,792 --> 00:16:04,262
No judgment on you there, darlin'.

203
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:07,598
Maybe you can talk to the Father here...

204
00:16:07,599 --> 00:16:11,337
about, uh, Mary Magdalene and forgiveness and whatnot.

205
00:16:13,337 --> 00:16:14,772
Room five will be fine.

206
00:16:34,091 --> 00:16:35,961
Please sign the ledger.

207
00:16:36,961 --> 00:16:39,101
And it's 25 cents for the coffee.

208
00:16:46,571 --> 00:16:49,447
Okay. Of course.

209
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:57,790
Thank you.

210
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:07,924
Can I give you a hand to your room?

211
00:17:07,925 --> 00:17:09,065
No.

212
00:17:14,065 --> 00:17:15,833
Sorry, Father. Uh...

213
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:18,842
That's very kind of you. But I can manage from here.

214
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:27,713
Ma'am.

215
00:17:28,713 --> 00:17:30,714
Good afternoon.

216
00:17:30,715 --> 00:17:32,353
Who's next?

217
00:17:35,353 --> 00:17:37,726
Please, be my fuckin' guest.

218
00:17:41,726 --> 00:17:43,670
I need a room.

219
00:17:53,738 --> 00:17:56,606
The El Royale is a bi-state establishment.

220
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:58,976
You have the option to stay in either the great state of...

221
00:17:58,977 --> 00:18:00,547
I'll take this one.

222
00:18:04,048 --> 00:18:05,115
Um...

223
00:18:05,116 --> 00:18:06,116
Don't fuckin' tell me.

224
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:10,187
I'll take room one.

225
00:18:10,188 --> 00:18:11,468
You can't have room one.

226
00:18:12,022 --> 00:18:14,591
Do you not see my fortnighter right there at your feet?

227
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,193
Do I really have to explain

228
00:18:16,194 --> 00:18:18,394
the concept of a free-market claim stake...

229
00:18:18,395 --> 00:18:19,896
to the goddamn hippie?

230
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,199
Give me something along this wall then.

231
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,499
The available rooms on that wall

232
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,701
have yet to be cleaned, and...

233
00:18:24,702 --> 00:18:26,702
I don't give a shit. How much?

234
00:18:26,703 --> 00:18:27,938
Eight dollars.

235
00:18:35,146 --> 00:18:37,663
Please sign the ledger.

236
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:54,036
You have yourself a pleasant day, ma'am.

237
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,188
Nice.

238
00:19:17,188 --> 00:19:19,730
I'll take room one.

239
00:20:53,117 --> 00:20:55,354
Hello, my love. I'm sorry.

240
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:57,822
I know.

241
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:00,257
Check-in took a little longer than expected.

242
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:01,327
Is she still up?

243
00:21:03,327 --> 00:21:04,964
Good.

244
00:21:07,964 --> 00:21:09,169
Hello, bunny rabbit.

245
00:21:11,169 --> 00:21:12,635
Yes.

246
00:21:12,636 --> 00:21:15,070
The clock is right and Daddy is wrong.

247
00:21:15,071 --> 00:21:17,845
I'm sorry. I was delayed.

248
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,547
I am ready.

249
00:21:23,547 --> 00:21:26,618
Yes, I am on my knees.

250
00:21:27,618 --> 00:21:30,689
Now I lay me down to sleep...

251
00:21:31,689 --> 00:21:35,793
pray the Lord my soul to keep.

252
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:39,468
If I should die before I wake...

253
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:45,407
We're not saying that part anymore?

254
00:21:49,407 --> 00:21:51,577
Where did you hear the word "morbid"?

255
00:21:53,577 --> 00:21:56,083
Well, what does Mommy want us to say?

256
00:21:58,083 --> 00:22:00,750
"And when I wake in the morning light"? Okay.

257
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:03,255
And when I wake in the...

258
00:22:04,255 --> 00:22:05,255
From the beginning?

259
00:22:07,157 --> 00:22:08,624
Okay.

260
00:22:08,625 --> 00:22:11,760
Now I lay me down to sleep...

261
00:22:11,761 --> 00:22:16,404
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

262
00:22:19,404 --> 00:22:22,377
And when I wake in the morning light...

263
00:22:26,377 --> 00:22:29,115
teach me to do what's right.

264
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:31,618
Amen.

265
00:22:34,618 --> 00:22:36,487
Okay, bunny rabbit, Daddy has to go.

266
00:22:36,488 --> 00:22:37,820
Will you tell Mommy I love her?

267
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:40,057
And I love you, too. Sleep tight.

268
00:25:14,878 --> 00:25:16,814
Together can serve the cause of peace.

269
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:18,816
Mr. President, do you consider it possible

270
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,418
to have a ceasefire in Vietnam...

271
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:26,690
so long as the Viet Cong still occupy Vietnamese territory?

272
00:25:26,691 --> 00:25:30,093
I think that it is not helpful in discussing Vietnam...

273
00:25:30,094 --> 00:25:33,095
to use such terms as "ceasefire"...

274
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:36,232
because ceasefire is a term of art...

275
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:37,393
that really has no relevance,

276
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:41,837
in my opinion, to a guerrilla war.

277
00:25:41,838 --> 00:25:43,839
When you're talking about a conventional war...

278
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,843
then a ceasefire, agreed upon by two parties,

279
00:25:46,844 --> 00:25:49,246
means that the shooting stops.

280
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:51,581
But when you have a guerrilla war in which

281
00:25:51,582 --> 00:25:54,019
one side may not even be able to control...

282
00:25:55,019 --> 00:25:57,754
many of those who are responsible

283
00:25:57,755 --> 00:26:01,258
for the violence in the area...

284
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:05,095
the ceasefire may be meaningless.

285
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,565
This is a Channel 7 News Special Report.

286
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:10,467
Police are searching for suspects

287
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:11,868
in the grisly murders...

288
00:26:11,869 --> 00:26:14,104
of noted Malibu County pediatrician

289
00:26:14,105 --> 00:26:16,873
Bernard Webber and his wife, Etheline.

290
00:26:16,874 --> 00:26:18,607
The couple was found stabbed to death

291
00:26:18,608 --> 00:26:20,408
early this morning in their beachfront home.

292
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:13,482
Director's office. Case 246673.

293
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,622
Director Hoover, it's Special Agent Broadbeck.

294
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:22,693
I'm here on site at the El Royale.

295
00:34:23,693 --> 00:34:25,838
Sir, we have a problem.

296
00:34:34,838 --> 00:34:37,906
Good morning, everyone. Let's have a listen, shall we?

297
00:35:45,007 --> 00:35:46,244
Cut. Cut.

298
00:35:47,244 --> 00:35:48,845
Cut it.

299
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:53,515
All right, let's take a break, everyone. Shall we?

300
00:35:53,516 --> 00:35:57,092
And, Darlene, a word, please.

301
00:36:02,092 --> 00:36:03,827
Darlene...

302
00:36:04,827 --> 00:36:07,863
do you know how much my time is worth?

303
00:36:07,864 --> 00:36:09,333
No, sir, um...

304
00:36:10,333 --> 00:36:11,533
Mr. Sunday.

305
00:36:11,534 --> 00:36:15,538
Well, Columbia Records does.

306
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:20,241
Columbia Records currently values my time

307
00:36:20,242 --> 00:36:23,513
at $200 an hour.

308
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:24,814
Are you currently in a position

309
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:26,381
where you can afford to turn down...

310
00:36:26,382 --> 00:36:30,218
two, four, $600 when it's offered to you?

311
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:31,921
No, I'm not.

312
00:36:31,922 --> 00:36:32,922
Mmm.

313
00:36:34,157 --> 00:36:35,759
$600 of my time...

314
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,761
and still you wanted to stay, what was it?

315
00:36:39,762 --> 00:36:40,997
"Fresh."

316
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:43,165
Which apparently means flat on the intro

317
00:36:43,166 --> 00:36:44,869
and sharp on harmonies.

318
00:36:47,204 --> 00:36:50,772
I'll get it right next time, Mr. Sunday. I promise.

319
00:36:50,773 --> 00:36:51,773
Yeah.

320
00:36:56,679 --> 00:37:00,318
Do you know how much your time is worth, Darlene?

321
00:37:01,318 --> 00:37:04,252
$12 a session.

322
00:37:04,253 --> 00:37:07,689
No matter how long the session.

323
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,593
Which, I suppose, means the longer I keep you,

324
00:37:10,594 --> 00:37:12,664
the less your time is worth.

325
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:16,206
Right?

326
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:29,481
Darlene...

327
00:37:31,481 --> 00:37:34,549
I think that you have a choice here.

328
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:37,419
Give me one year of your time.

329
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:39,489
I can make you a star.

330
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:42,524
You'll be singing lead...

331
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:44,297
headlining the Riviera.

332
00:37:46,297 --> 00:37:47,766
Or...

333
00:37:49,766 --> 00:37:53,236
you can continue to treat my time as disposable.

334
00:37:53,237 --> 00:37:58,610
Keep scrounging for $12 backup gigs until they dry up.

335
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,178
Five years from now, you'll wake up...

336
00:38:03,179 --> 00:38:06,549
find yourself shuffling between shit hotels...

337
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:11,453
begging for the opening slot on pancake night...

338
00:38:11,454 --> 00:38:13,228
in Reno.

339
00:38:19,228 --> 00:38:20,300
Darlene.

340
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,373
Do we understand?

341
00:38:29,373 --> 00:38:31,473
Good.

342
00:38:31,474 --> 00:38:33,527
All right then.

343
00:39:15,585 --> 00:39:17,486
Yes?

344
00:39:17,487 --> 00:39:18,721
Hello, Darlene.

345
00:39:18,722 --> 00:39:20,068
It's Father Flynn from earlier.

346
00:39:33,168 --> 00:39:36,471
I'm so sorry. I was making too much noise, wasn't I?

347
00:39:36,472 --> 00:39:38,406
Oh, no. No, not at all.

348
00:39:38,407 --> 00:39:40,142
I have to rehearse and I was trying

349
00:39:40,143 --> 00:39:41,709
to keep it quiet, but...

350
00:39:41,710 --> 00:39:43,678
I'm sorry, I won't bother you.

351
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,080
No, it was no bother.

352
00:39:45,081 --> 00:39:47,985
Quite the opposite, actually. It's lovely.

353
00:39:48,985 --> 00:39:50,653
Thank you.

354
00:39:50,654 --> 00:39:52,221
That song that you were singing,

355
00:39:52,222 --> 00:39:53,222
did you write that?

356
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:56,558
Oh, no, it's by The Isley Brothers.

357
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:57,893
Your brothers wrote that?

358
00:39:57,894 --> 00:40:00,462
No, um, it's a famous song.

359
00:40:00,463 --> 00:40:01,930
It's been on the radio.

360
00:40:01,931 --> 00:40:05,767
Oh. I don't know too much about the radio these days.

361
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:09,538
I was gonna go find some food in the lounge...

362
00:40:09,539 --> 00:40:11,806
and I thought I'd see if you'd like to join?

363
00:40:11,807 --> 00:40:14,810
With this place, there's probably strength in numbers.

364
00:40:14,811 --> 00:40:16,511
No, that's all right.

365
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:19,147
You sure? It's on me.

366
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:21,485
Consider it payment.

367
00:40:22,485 --> 00:40:25,120
For letting me listen to you sing.

368
00:40:27,657 --> 00:40:29,128
That's a very nice thing to say.

369
00:40:46,242 --> 00:40:49,479
Why even have a bell?

370
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:51,513
I suspect we're on our own.

371
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:54,018
I handle food. You handle entertainment?

372
00:40:55,018 --> 00:40:56,956
Deal.

373
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,723
We're told both the husband and wife

374
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,225
suffered multiple stab wounds...

375
00:41:02,226 --> 00:41:04,160
and were dead when the deputies arrived.

376
00:41:04,161 --> 00:41:07,196
Bernard Webber was well known in the Malibu community...

377
00:41:07,197 --> 00:41:10,466
and was very active in local philanthropic endeavors...

378
00:41:10,467 --> 00:41:12,873
mostly concerning homeless children.

379
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,408
You really never heard of The Isley Brothers?

380
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,347
Then we have some work to do.

381
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:49,110
How are you making out over here?

382
00:41:55,512 --> 00:41:57,413
You're definitely better at your job

383
00:41:57,414 --> 00:41:58,414
than I am at mine.

384
00:42:01,518 --> 00:42:04,755
How lucky are you feeling tonight?

385
00:42:05,755 --> 00:42:08,156
Definitely not eat-that-sandwich lucky.

386
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,528
Pie?

387
00:42:12,529 --> 00:42:14,536
Pie's good.

388
00:42:20,536 --> 00:42:22,171
We have a very good, uh...

389
00:42:22,172 --> 00:42:25,274
Well, no. Now that I've heard you sing...

390
00:42:25,275 --> 00:42:28,544
we have a pretty good choir at the Heart of Mary.

391
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:30,014
That's actually how I got started.

392
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:32,014
Church choir.

393
00:42:31,014 --> 00:42:32,281
Ah.

394
00:42:32,282 --> 00:42:35,350
St. Paul's Evangelical in Decatur.

395
00:42:35,351 --> 00:42:38,654
Lutheran. But we don't have to get into that.

396
00:42:38,655 --> 00:42:40,723
You're forgiven.

397
00:42:40,724 --> 00:42:44,225
I'm sure we must've sung some of the same stuff.

398
00:42:44,226 --> 00:42:48,497
Do you know, um, Nearer, My God, to Thee?

399
00:42:48,498 --> 00:42:49,564
Mmm.

400
00:42:49,565 --> 00:42:52,335
And Alleluia! Sing to Jesus?

401
00:42:53,335 --> 00:42:54,970
Mmm.

402
00:42:54,971 --> 00:42:59,841
What about Hold Me in Your Arms, Lift Me on High?

403
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:01,842
That was my first solo.

404
00:42:59,842 --> 00:43:01,445
Oh.

405
00:43:02,445 --> 00:43:04,382
It goes...

406
00:43:13,623 --> 00:43:14,823
You got that?

407
00:43:16,226 --> 00:43:19,431
To be honest, my memory, um...

408
00:43:21,431 --> 00:43:24,466
isn't quite what it was.

409
00:43:24,467 --> 00:43:25,467
Okay.

410
00:43:29,972 --> 00:43:32,741
I think I'm gonna have a toddy.

411
00:43:32,742 --> 00:43:34,209
Can I interest you?

412
00:43:34,210 --> 00:43:35,343
No, I'm fine.

413
00:43:35,344 --> 00:43:36,846
No? You sure?

414
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,348
Nothing like a warm whiskey on a cold night.

415
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:41,884
I'm fine. Thank you.

416
00:44:09,846 --> 00:44:11,913
So, what are you doing out here?

417
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:13,316
Oh, I live in Bakersfield now,

418
00:44:13,317 --> 00:44:15,618
but I got a job singing in Reno tomorrow.

419
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:17,252
Oh, that's exciting.

420
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:19,721
That's not exactly the word I'd use

421
00:44:19,722 --> 00:44:22,223
to describe a 6:00 shift at the keno lounge.

422
00:44:23,927 --> 00:44:25,660
But, um, it's a job.

423
00:44:25,661 --> 00:44:26,995
Why are you staying here?

424
00:44:26,996 --> 00:44:28,897
It's not a good job.

425
00:44:28,898 --> 00:44:30,966
Don't pay nothing.

426
00:44:30,967 --> 00:44:34,903
But if I stay in Reno proper, I'd be in the hole.

427
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:37,904
Outskirts are cheaper.

428
00:44:34,904 --> 00:44:37,307
Ah.

429
00:44:38,307 --> 00:44:40,780
Why do it at all?

430
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:45,449
You know, I ask myself the same question sometimes.

431
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:47,920
Mmm.

432
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,963
Singing's singing.

433
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,296
How about you?

434
00:45:02,297 --> 00:45:04,700
How'd you end up at the El Royale?

435
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:07,236
I was visiting my brother in Oakland...

436
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:10,272
and, uh, I had to get off the road before dark.

437
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:14,442
Well, my eyes, they're no good at night.

438
00:45:14,443 --> 00:45:16,012
And the Ritz-Carlton was booked...

439
00:45:17,012 --> 00:45:19,680
so here we are.

440
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:22,584
I'm guessing church pays about as much as a keno lounge?

441
00:45:22,585 --> 00:45:23,886
Mmm-hmm.

442
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:25,387
About that, yeah.

443
00:45:26,556 --> 00:45:28,723
How about your brother?

444
00:45:28,724 --> 00:45:30,759
You and him close?

445
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,065
Used to be.

446
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:36,565
Used to be, yeah.

447
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,304
Hmm.

448
00:45:41,304 --> 00:45:43,305
Darlene...

449
00:45:43,306 --> 00:45:45,041
can I confess something to you?

450
00:45:46,041 --> 00:45:50,279
When I said that my memory isn't quite what it was...

451
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:54,052
I think I might have been understating things a bit.

452
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:59,056
For the last couple of years, my recall...

453
00:46:00,056 --> 00:46:02,390
well, I've been having problems with it.

454
00:46:02,391 --> 00:46:06,562
And, uh, I don't think it's just my age.

455
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:10,335
I'm certain it's not just my age.

456
00:46:12,335 --> 00:46:15,141
I wake up some days...

457
00:46:19,141 --> 00:46:23,182
and I can't remember who I am.

458
00:46:27,182 --> 00:46:30,218
I have moments when I lose time.

459
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:33,955
When you saw me earlier today in the parking lot...

460
00:46:33,956 --> 00:46:35,723
actually, I had completely forgotten

461
00:46:35,724 --> 00:46:37,927
where I was, what I was doing.

462
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:42,082
Strangest feeling. You know, you look around

463
00:46:43,032 --> 00:46:45,271
and you're someone else...

464
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:50,646
and you don't know who that is.

465
00:46:58,114 --> 00:47:00,883
Can I say something, Father?

466
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,151
Please.

467
00:47:03,152 --> 00:47:05,553
I think you should see a doctor.

468
00:47:05,554 --> 00:47:08,059
Yeah, I have, and he agrees with my assessment

469
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:11,561
that it's not just age.

470
00:47:14,664 --> 00:47:15,830
I'm sorry.

471
00:47:15,831 --> 00:47:18,634
Oh, I'm not looking for pithy.

472
00:47:18,635 --> 00:47:19,938
Pithy.

473
00:47:24,606 --> 00:47:25,941
I'm just letting you know

474
00:47:25,942 --> 00:47:28,243
in case I've seemed scattered...

475
00:47:28,244 --> 00:47:29,944
I don't mean offense, ma'am.

476
00:47:29,945 --> 00:47:31,413
No.

477
00:47:31,414 --> 00:47:32,851
None taken.

478
00:47:34,851 --> 00:47:36,919
It might be for the best.

479
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:41,094
There are parts of my life that aren't worth remembering.

480
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,641
I have those, too.

481
00:48:07,784 --> 00:48:09,984
I could use another.

482
00:48:11,154 --> 00:48:12,953
You sure I can't tempt you?

483
00:48:12,954 --> 00:48:14,390
No, I'm fine.

484
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,457
Are you sure?

485
00:48:15,458 --> 00:48:17,359
Now, I may have a spotty memory...

486
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:21,596
but I do recall it is a sin to let an old priest drink alone.

487
00:48:21,597 --> 00:48:23,566
All right. Just one.

488
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:24,567
Grand.

489
00:48:36,179 --> 00:48:39,016
Perhaps I can even tempt you...

490
00:48:40,016 --> 00:48:44,285
to grace me with a song again later?

491
00:48:44,286 --> 00:48:46,421
Don't push your luck, Father.

492
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:48,723
But if you happen to be in Reno tomorrow,

493
00:48:48,724 --> 00:48:50,496
I go on at 6:00.

494
00:48:53,496 --> 00:48:55,742
Oh, I'd like that.

495
00:49:06,742 --> 00:49:08,048
I'd like that.

496
00:49:13,048 --> 00:49:14,434
But until then...

497
00:49:30,434 --> 00:49:31,799
In the course of

498
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,067
retrieving our equipment...

499
00:49:33,068 --> 00:49:34,502
I discovered another wiretap

500
00:49:34,503 --> 00:49:36,370
along with several other microphones.

501
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:38,774
Did you recognize the equipment?

502
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:40,942
I don't believe they were ours, sir.

503
00:49:40,943 --> 00:49:42,410
Additionally, I discovered

504
00:49:42,411 --> 00:49:45,913
the hotel room had a two-way mirror.

505
00:49:45,914 --> 00:49:47,982
I also found several other hotel rooms

506
00:49:47,983 --> 00:49:50,319
with the same setup along an observation corridor...

507
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,754
as well as a camera.

508
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:54,355
Did you find film?

509
00:49:54,356 --> 00:49:57,225
No, I called in as soon as I found the camera.

510
00:49:57,226 --> 00:49:58,660
We must assume

511
00:49:58,661 --> 00:50:00,428
our operation has been compromised.

512
00:50:00,429 --> 00:50:02,397
No one is to leave there, Agent Broadbeck...

513
00:50:02,398 --> 00:50:04,098
until you have any and all

514
00:50:04,099 --> 00:50:06,901
existing surveillance materials in your possession.

515
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:08,726
Understood, sir.

516
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:36,869
Sir, there is something else.

517
00:50:39,869 --> 00:50:42,638
Upon investigating the observation corridor...

518
00:50:42,639 --> 00:50:46,010
I came across what appeared to be a kidnapping in process.

519
00:50:47,010 --> 00:50:48,676
A young woman, Caucasian,

520
00:50:48,677 --> 00:50:51,779
appeared to be holding another young woman hostage.

521
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,614
Also Caucasian.

522
00:50:53,615 --> 00:50:55,850
The priority is the surveillance materials,

523
00:50:55,851 --> 00:50:57,319
Agent Broadbeck.

524
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,388
Peripheral matters are not our concern.

525
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:00,389
Sir...

526
00:51:01,056 --> 00:51:02,390
I am not in the habit of repeating myself,

527
00:51:02,391 --> 00:51:03,857
Agent Broadbeck...

528
00:51:03,858 --> 00:51:07,157
but I will do so here to ensure there is no confusion.

529
00:52:08,157 --> 00:52:09,898
Hiya!

530
00:52:15,898 --> 00:52:17,835
Hi.

531
00:52:18,835 --> 00:52:20,404
I like your boots.

532
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,205
They're my daddy's.

533
00:52:23,206 --> 00:52:25,242
Well, they don't look like your daddy's no more.

534
00:52:27,242 --> 00:52:29,581
Is that why you're so sad?

535
00:52:32,581 --> 00:52:35,750
We don't get a lot of girls down here in boots.

536
00:52:35,751 --> 00:52:38,590
You must have come straight from the station, huh?

537
00:52:41,590 --> 00:52:44,459
It's all right, Boots. You don't got to say nothin'.

538
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:47,197
I'll figure it out in three guesses. Watch.

539
00:52:48,197 --> 00:52:49,800
Tennessee?

540
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:54,502
Nah, that's too easy.

541
00:52:54,503 --> 00:52:58,140
You ain't no Texas girl. I know that much for sure.

542
00:52:58,141 --> 00:53:00,174
West Virginia?

543
00:53:00,175 --> 00:53:01,810
Nah, of course not.

544
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:05,147
Don't insult the girl, Billy Lee.

545
00:53:05,148 --> 00:53:07,082
Hey, I'm just messing with you.

546
00:53:07,083 --> 00:53:08,383
I knew it the second I saw

547
00:53:08,384 --> 00:53:10,785
these boot prints on the beach.

548
00:53:10,786 --> 00:53:14,056
You're an Alabama girl.

549
00:53:15,056 --> 00:53:17,125
See?

550
00:53:17,126 --> 00:53:19,627
Told you I could do it in three.

551
00:53:19,628 --> 00:53:22,266
Now, you gotta come swimming with me.

552
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:24,266
That wasn't the deal.

553
00:53:25,034 --> 00:53:27,268
Sure it was.

554
00:53:27,269 --> 00:53:29,677
You knew the game the second we started playing.

555
00:53:34,677 --> 00:53:38,481
Come on, Boots. You got no reason to cry no more.

556
00:53:39,481 --> 00:53:41,126
You're in California now.

557
00:53:53,329 --> 00:53:54,666
Rose?

558
00:53:58,233 --> 00:53:59,968
Rosie.

559
00:53:59,969 --> 00:54:01,338
Rose, hey. It's okay.

560
00:54:03,338 --> 00:54:04,805
It's okay.

561
00:54:04,806 --> 00:54:07,880
You're safe. You're with me.

562
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,380
It's okay. It's okay.

563
00:54:15,116 --> 00:54:16,183
Rosie, I can't untie you.

564
00:54:16,184 --> 00:54:17,692
Stop it.

565
00:54:23,692 --> 00:54:25,212
I expect you're all kinds of mad at me,

566
00:54:26,027 --> 00:54:28,897
and to some extent you're right to be...

567
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,135
but we're gonna wait this out.

568
00:54:34,135 --> 00:54:35,671
I'm gonna get you clear...

569
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:37,672
and then we can have it out.

570
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:50,590
We have to get as far away from him as possible.

571
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:57,860
He's all kinds of bad.

572
00:54:58,860 --> 00:55:01,065
It doesn't matter what you did, Rose.

573
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:05,969
I'm gonna get you clear...

574
00:55:06,969 --> 00:55:09,005
and then we'll just start over.

575
00:55:11,907 --> 00:55:13,508
Ma'am?

576
00:55:13,509 --> 00:55:15,561
Hello. I'm sorry to disturb you.

577
00:55:32,561 --> 00:55:33,561
What do you want?

578
00:55:34,063 --> 00:55:37,899
Oh. Ma'am, yeah. It's Laramie Sullivan.

579
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:39,460
We met in the hotel lobby there earlier?

580
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,039
Would you mind opening the door?

581
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:46,375
No, I ain't gonna do that.

582
00:55:46,376 --> 00:55:47,642
I certainly

583
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:49,076
understand that, yes.

584
00:55:49,077 --> 00:55:50,345
It's good to be cautious.

585
00:55:50,346 --> 00:55:52,247
We can talk through the door, if you like.

586
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:53,248
What do you want?

587
00:55:54,050 --> 00:55:56,317
Oh, well, ma'am, the storm's just wreckin'

588
00:55:56,318 --> 00:55:57,852
all kinds of hell on the hotel.

589
00:55:57,853 --> 00:56:00,622
People are having complaints about losing power and such...

590
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:03,091
and so the boy up front had asked me to come around...

591
00:56:03,092 --> 00:56:06,160
check on some of the women and make sure they're safe.

592
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:07,629
I'm fine.

593
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,631
Well, that's good to hear. That's good to hear.

594
00:56:09,632 --> 00:56:11,232
Uh, listen, if you wouldn't mind...

595
00:56:11,233 --> 00:56:13,175
Fuck off.

596
00:56:21,175 --> 00:56:24,312
I'm very sorry to have spooked you, ma'am.

597
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:25,990
You have a safe night.

598
00:56:40,496 --> 00:56:42,462
Hey, hey, hey. Look at me!

599
00:56:42,463 --> 00:56:44,366
It's gonna be okay. It's okay.

600
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:45,635
Okay? It's okay.

601
00:56:46,635 --> 00:56:48,301
You're safe now.

602
00:56:48,302 --> 00:56:49,837
Let's get you untied.

603
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:51,507
Don't touch it.

604
00:56:52,507 --> 00:56:54,341
You let it bleed.

605
00:56:54,342 --> 00:56:56,477
Next time you wanna get smart,

606
00:56:56,478 --> 00:56:59,147
look down at all that red and think twice.

607
00:57:04,052 --> 00:57:05,391
Where's Rosie?

608
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:10,530
Rosie, Rosie?

609
00:57:15,530 --> 00:57:16,964
Don't you come out, okay?

610
00:57:16,965 --> 00:57:19,167
No matter what you hear, you stay put.

611
00:57:19,168 --> 00:57:21,069
Where's Rosie?

612
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:23,039
No matter what you hear, don't make a sound.

613
00:57:30,612 --> 00:57:32,016
Okay, listen to me.

614
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,585
You don't have to be afraid anymore.

615
00:57:36,585 --> 00:57:38,288
Okay, good.

616
00:57:39,288 --> 00:57:40,425
Rosie.

617
00:57:43,425 --> 00:57:45,438
Get out of the way.

618
00:57:55,438 --> 00:57:56,438
Listen.

619
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:23,592
Father Flynn.

620
00:59:24,592 --> 00:59:25,592
Father?

621
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:27,494
Father Flynn.

622
00:59:30,398 --> 00:59:32,536
Father Flynn.

623
00:59:33,536 --> 00:59:36,840
Hey. Don't try to move, Father.

624
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:39,175
I'm not your father.

625
00:59:42,911 --> 00:59:45,546
Take it easy. Take it real easy.

626
00:59:45,547 --> 00:59:47,647
What the heck happened?

627
00:59:47,648 --> 00:59:49,822
Oh, what's this song?

628
00:59:52,822 --> 00:59:56,626
Father, do you know where you are?

629
00:59:58,626 --> 00:59:59,761
What happened?

630
00:59:59,762 --> 01:00:01,382
That's what I'm asking you.

631
01:00:01,563 --> 01:00:03,400
I just found you like this. On the floor.

632
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,206
You got glass in your head.

633
01:00:15,344 --> 01:00:17,078
Where...?

634
01:00:17,079 --> 01:00:19,113
Was I alone?

635
01:00:19,114 --> 01:00:21,951
Yeah. Why? Was you with somebody?

636
01:00:22,951 --> 01:00:24,054
No.

637
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:26,523
No.

638
01:00:28,523 --> 01:00:30,459
Kid, what's your name again?

639
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:31,591
Miles.

640
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:34,761
Miles. I need a drink.

641
01:00:34,762 --> 01:00:36,964
Fix me a drink.

642
01:00:36,965 --> 01:00:40,602
Oh, I'm not so sure that's a good idea.

643
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:43,171
Just one drink to clear my head.

644
01:00:43,172 --> 01:00:45,576
I'd get it myself, but look what happens.

645
01:00:50,746 --> 01:00:52,315
Miles, I fell down.

646
01:00:53,315 --> 01:00:54,915
I'm old.

647
01:00:54,916 --> 01:00:57,463
Shit happens. Get the whiskey.

648
01:01:08,463 --> 01:01:10,330
Father...

649
01:01:10,331 --> 01:01:12,735
I was hopin'...

650
01:01:13,735 --> 01:01:16,773
I was hopin' I could ask for your help.

651
01:01:17,773 --> 01:01:19,043
I've been gone...

652
01:01:21,043 --> 01:01:24,117
gone from the church for a while now.

653
01:01:28,117 --> 01:01:30,952
But I was devout my whole life.

654
01:01:31,952 --> 01:01:34,355
Baptized, confirmed...

655
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:37,994
never missed a Sunday till I left Indiana.

656
01:01:38,994 --> 01:01:41,562
I was born in Indiana.

657
01:01:41,563 --> 01:01:43,131
Really? No kiddin'?

658
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:44,135
Whereabouts?

659
01:01:47,135 --> 01:01:48,871
Okay.

660
01:01:49,871 --> 01:01:52,943
Father, I was hopin', see...

661
01:01:54,943 --> 01:01:57,282
I got things I need to confess.

662
01:02:00,282 --> 01:02:01,582
Not now, kid.

663
01:02:01,583 --> 01:02:03,852
Okay, Father. Right.

664
01:02:03,853 --> 01:02:05,291
Of course.

665
01:02:08,291 --> 01:02:10,091
It's just...

666
01:02:10,092 --> 01:02:12,963
I'm penitent, Father.

667
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:16,201
I promise I'm penitent.

668
01:02:19,201 --> 01:02:21,505
And I'm afraid for my soul.

669
01:02:24,505 --> 01:02:26,945
I've done horrible things.

670
01:02:30,945 --> 01:02:34,717
So? So has everybody.

671
01:02:35,717 --> 01:02:37,224
You'll be fine.

672
01:02:42,224 --> 01:02:45,493
You have a master key to this place?

673
01:02:45,494 --> 01:02:48,664
Did you lock yourself out of your room?

674
01:02:49,664 --> 01:02:52,538
Like I said, kid, I'm old.

675
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:57,175
I'm old.

676
01:03:01,175 --> 01:03:03,695
Should be right here.

677
01:03:20,695 --> 01:03:22,733
Father...

678
01:03:23,733 --> 01:03:25,507
Where's the key?

679
01:03:32,507 --> 01:03:34,045
Miles.

680
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:39,113
I told you...

681
01:03:39,114 --> 01:03:41,452
this wasn't a good place, Father.

682
01:04:10,411 --> 01:04:12,113
You watched me?

683
01:04:12,114 --> 01:04:13,547
What did you see?

684
01:04:13,548 --> 01:04:15,148
I didn't see nothing! I didn't, I didn't.

685
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,685
I only watch who they tell me to watch.

686
01:04:18,686 --> 01:04:19,921
Who's "they"?

687
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:21,589
Management.

688
01:04:21,590 --> 01:04:23,323
I get a call...

689
01:04:23,324 --> 01:04:26,329
"So-and-so is checking in, set up the camera."

690
01:04:27,329 --> 01:04:30,964
Hasn't happened much since the election.

691
01:04:33,668 --> 01:04:38,071
Mostly they just want, you know, people screwin'.

692
01:04:38,072 --> 01:04:40,908
What do you do with the film?

693
01:04:40,909 --> 01:04:43,142
Develop it in one of the back cabins,

694
01:04:43,143 --> 01:04:44,213
mail it to management.

695
01:04:46,213 --> 01:04:48,851
P.O. box in Pennsylvania.

696
01:04:50,851 --> 01:04:53,925
Do you ever keep any of the film?

697
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,695
Do you ever keep any of it?

698
01:05:00,695 --> 01:05:02,997
Miles?

699
01:05:04,965 --> 01:05:07,567
Last year. The big celebration.

700
01:05:07,568 --> 01:05:08,703
A man stayed with us.

701
01:05:08,704 --> 01:05:12,272
He was a big deal, you would know him.

702
01:05:12,273 --> 01:05:16,977
Management wanted him. They really wanted him.

703
01:05:16,978 --> 01:05:19,882
But he was kind to me.

704
01:05:20,882 --> 01:05:23,584
Nobody's ever kind to me...

705
01:05:23,585 --> 01:05:26,956
so I told them there wasn't no woman in his room.

706
01:05:30,125 --> 01:05:33,367
So you kept it, the film?

707
01:05:40,902 --> 01:05:45,309
Father, this ain't even what I was trying to confess.

708
01:05:48,309 --> 01:05:51,016
I've done so much worse than this.

709
01:05:55,016 --> 01:05:56,987
Who is that?

710
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:00,690
Oh, Jesus!

711
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:04,427
Oh.

712
01:06:06,428 --> 01:06:07,563
It's okay.

713
01:06:08,563 --> 01:06:10,598
It's okay.

714
01:06:10,599 --> 01:06:12,767
You're safe.

715
01:06:12,768 --> 01:06:15,170
You're with me.

716
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,538
We gotta help her.

717
01:06:19,040 --> 01:06:20,543
We gotta help her, Father.

718
01:06:21,543 --> 01:06:23,377
We gotta do something. We gotta help her.

719
01:06:24,379 --> 01:06:25,745
Miles, listen to me. Miles!

720
01:06:25,746 --> 01:06:27,247
Listen to me.

721
01:06:27,248 --> 01:06:33,139
The Lord wants you to tell me where the film is.

722
01:06:51,139 --> 01:06:54,612
He's all kinds of bad.

723
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:01,214
Father Flynn.

724
01:07:01,215 --> 01:07:03,317
Ma'am? Hello?

725
01:07:03,318 --> 01:07:05,922
I'm so sorry to bother you.

726
01:07:07,922 --> 01:07:09,556
What do you want?

727
01:07:09,557 --> 01:07:11,959
Ma'am, it's Laramie Sullivan.

728
01:07:11,960 --> 01:07:13,264
Father Flynn!

729
01:07:17,264 --> 01:07:18,784
Father Flynn!

730
01:07:21,235 --> 01:07:22,669
Father Flynn, get down here!

731
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,504
That vacuum man just busted down the door...

732
01:07:24,505 --> 01:07:26,406
and he beat up that other girl, and he's got a gun!

733
01:07:26,407 --> 01:07:27,607
Get away from the window! Kid!

734
01:07:46,728 --> 01:07:48,197
Help me.

735
01:07:55,471 --> 01:07:56,871
Help.

736
01:07:57,871 --> 01:07:59,945
What the fuck?

737
01:08:06,847 --> 01:08:08,123
Jesus fucking Christ!

738
01:08:15,322 --> 01:08:17,358
Don't push your luck, Father.

739
01:08:17,359 --> 01:08:19,393
But if you happen to be in Reno tomorrow,

740
01:08:19,394 --> 01:08:21,966
I go on at 6:00.

741
01:08:24,966 --> 01:08:26,002
Oh, I'd like that.

742
01:08:28,002 --> 01:08:29,038
But until then...

743
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:54,388
Come on.

744
01:09:54,389 --> 01:09:56,823
Come on! Come on!

745
01:10:03,131 --> 01:10:04,697
Lord...

746
01:10:09,337 --> 01:10:10,608
Lord...

747
01:10:13,608 --> 01:10:15,979
I need your guidance.

748
01:10:16,979 --> 01:10:19,844
I'm in darkness, and I need your light.

749
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,836
Rose, get out of the way.

750
01:11:26,715 --> 01:11:28,423
Jesus fucking Christ!

751
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:37,224
Rosie...

752
01:11:37,225 --> 01:11:38,675
you stay here.

753
01:11:53,675 --> 01:11:55,675
Please don't kill...

754
01:11:53,675 --> 01:11:55,576
Come on.

755
01:11:55,577 --> 01:11:57,552
Keep your fucking hands where I can see them.

756
01:12:05,552 --> 01:12:07,121
What are you doing?

757
01:12:21,170 --> 01:12:22,170
Hi, it's me.

758
01:12:25,073 --> 01:12:26,073
I don't know.

759
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:28,942
I'm with Em.

760
01:12:28,943 --> 01:12:32,583
She had me all tied up. Think she shot a cop.

761
01:12:35,583 --> 01:12:37,886
We're in a hotel.

762
01:12:38,886 --> 01:12:40,059
I don't know.

763
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:45,829
You will?

764
01:12:47,829 --> 01:12:49,563
Okay.

765
01:12:49,564 --> 01:12:51,404
Let me look.

766
01:12:56,404 --> 01:12:59,206
It says "El Royale."

767
01:12:59,207 --> 01:13:01,075
Rosie!

768
01:13:01,076 --> 01:13:02,542
Rosie, get in here.

769
01:13:02,543 --> 01:13:04,081
I gotta go.

770
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:08,319
Okay. See you again soon.

771
01:13:11,319 --> 01:13:12,319
Rosie!

772
01:14:00,034 --> 01:14:02,909
Come on! Come on!

773
01:14:07,909 --> 01:14:09,410
No, no, no!

774
01:14:12,046 --> 01:14:13,719
Lord...

775
01:14:17,719 --> 01:14:19,721
I just wanna talk.

776
01:14:20,721 --> 01:14:22,626
Roll down the window.

777
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:27,827
I just wanna talk. Can I get in?

778
01:14:27,828 --> 01:14:29,563
I will shoot you in the face.

779
01:14:29,564 --> 01:14:30,564
Believe me.

780
01:14:31,064 --> 01:14:32,475
I believe you.

781
01:14:50,851 --> 01:14:54,895
Well, we're in a bit of a pickle here.

782
01:15:01,895 --> 01:15:06,198
I'm sorry that I tried to drug you back there in the lobby.

783
01:15:06,199 --> 01:15:09,102
I wasn't trying to diddle you or nothing like that...

784
01:15:09,103 --> 01:15:12,372
I just needed to break into your room.

785
01:15:12,373 --> 01:15:13,708
And I didn't wanna hurt you.

786
01:15:14,708 --> 01:15:17,681
Any more than need be, I mean.

787
01:15:20,681 --> 01:15:22,883
No hard feelings about bashing me in the head

788
01:15:22,884 --> 01:15:24,256
is what I'm saying.

789
01:15:29,256 --> 01:15:33,261
I'm pretty sure those girls killed a cop of some sort.

790
01:15:34,261 --> 01:15:35,298
They did.

791
01:15:37,298 --> 01:15:38,533
You saw it?

792
01:15:39,533 --> 01:15:40,533
Yeah.

793
01:15:42,270 --> 01:15:44,170
That his gun?

794
01:15:44,171 --> 01:15:45,609
Mmm-hmm.

795
01:15:47,609 --> 01:15:49,146
This is not so good for us.

796
01:15:52,146 --> 01:15:54,715
I'm not really a priest.

797
01:15:54,716 --> 01:15:57,082
Yeah, no shit.

798
01:16:28,082 --> 01:16:30,082
- Are they dead? - Nah, they'll live.

799
01:16:30,083 --> 01:16:31,417
Where'd you learn to drive?

800
01:16:31,418 --> 01:16:32,920
They swerved.

801
01:16:32,921 --> 01:16:34,487
Yeah, they tend to do that when you're box sweepin' 'em.

802
01:16:34,488 --> 01:16:36,790
"Stay on his fender," you said. "I want him scared."

803
01:16:36,791 --> 01:16:38,858
"Scared," not comatose.

804
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:41,462
Oh, here we go.

805
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:41,495
Are they dead?

806
01:16:41,496 --> 01:16:42,630
Okay.

807
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:43,631
Where'd you learn to drive?

808
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:44,730
We've been over this!

809
01:16:44,731 --> 01:16:46,534
Shut the fuck up! Get the money!

810
01:16:47,534 --> 01:16:48,935
They ain't dead.

811
01:16:48,936 --> 01:16:50,306
Praise the Lord.

812
01:16:52,306 --> 01:16:54,341
Well, can't leave this here.

813
01:16:54,342 --> 01:16:55,712
Yeah.

814
01:17:05,487 --> 01:17:07,590
Will it run?

815
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,091
Let's go with yes.

816
01:17:11,092 --> 01:17:13,993
Think the new guy is bent or just stupid?

817
01:17:13,994 --> 01:17:16,064
Oh, I'm going with stupid, but I can be persuaded.

818
01:17:24,671 --> 01:17:26,881
What are we doing, Dock?

819
01:17:33,881 --> 01:17:35,948
Get out of the car.

820
01:17:35,949 --> 01:17:37,350
Get out of the car, Felix.

821
01:17:37,351 --> 01:17:38,525
Here, here.

822
01:17:45,525 --> 01:17:46,992
Take the kid...

823
01:17:46,993 --> 01:17:49,996
ditch the Chevy at Rocklin. Split up.

824
01:17:49,997 --> 01:17:51,297
I'll lead 'em south,

825
01:17:51,298 --> 01:17:52,765
I'll burn this once I'm in the clear.

826
01:17:52,766 --> 01:17:55,304
We all meet at the El Royale, huh?

827
01:17:56,304 --> 01:17:58,805
Felix.

828
01:17:58,806 --> 01:18:02,516
You play it close with these assholes. Huh?

829
01:18:09,516 --> 01:18:10,556
You sure about this, Dock?

830
01:18:11,018 --> 01:18:13,853
Oh, we got this, Felix, piece of cake.

831
01:18:13,854 --> 01:18:16,290
I got it under control.

832
01:18:16,291 --> 01:18:17,291
All rise.

833
01:18:22,796 --> 01:18:24,297
Donald O'Kelly...

834
01:18:24,298 --> 01:18:26,198
on the charges of grand larceny

835
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:28,134
and conspiracy to commit larceny...

836
01:18:28,135 --> 01:18:31,673
I sentence you to 15 years in the federal penitentiary.

837
01:18:33,908 --> 01:18:35,108
What? Where?

838
01:18:35,109 --> 01:18:36,109
Dock.

839
01:18:35,109 --> 01:18:36,742
Where am I?

840
01:18:36,743 --> 01:18:38,911
Hey, hey, Dock.

841
01:18:38,912 --> 01:18:41,314
It's okay.

842
01:18:41,315 --> 01:18:43,082
What? Where am I?

843
01:18:43,083 --> 01:18:45,986
Same place you've been the last ten fucking years.

844
01:18:45,987 --> 01:18:48,457
You're gonna be okay, man.

845
01:18:50,457 --> 01:18:52,792
Jesus, Dock.

846
01:18:52,793 --> 01:18:55,629
We gotta do something about this.

847
01:18:59,766 --> 01:19:01,439
What do you think?

848
01:19:05,439 --> 01:19:07,340
I think you should stop fighting

849
01:19:07,341 --> 01:19:08,942
with the negroes, for starters.

850
01:19:08,943 --> 01:19:11,346
Mesican... Mesican...

851
01:19:13,346 --> 01:19:14,480
Mexicans.

852
01:19:14,481 --> 01:19:16,719
Yeah, them this time.

853
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:20,487
And I didn't do nothing.

854
01:19:20,488 --> 01:19:22,989
Hate to see what happens when you do something.

855
01:19:22,990 --> 01:19:24,523
Oh, well.

856
01:19:24,524 --> 01:19:26,326
Tell me that boy down the hall may not walk again.

857
01:19:26,327 --> 01:19:27,626
He jumped me.

858
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:29,970
Mmm-hmm. Yeah, sure.

859
01:19:36,970 --> 01:19:39,408
It's not about the fighting.

860
01:19:40,408 --> 01:19:42,108
No.

861
01:19:42,109 --> 01:19:44,715
It's not about the fightin'.

862
01:19:47,715 --> 01:19:50,918
Tell me about your family.

863
01:19:51,918 --> 01:19:55,694
Any history? Dementia? Alzheimer's?

864
01:20:02,529 --> 01:20:04,001
My mother.

865
01:20:06,001 --> 01:20:08,942
Her father.

866
01:20:14,942 --> 01:20:17,912
How long I got?

867
01:20:18,912 --> 01:20:20,880
When you up for parole?

868
01:20:20,881 --> 01:20:22,920
Six months.

869
01:20:25,920 --> 01:20:28,090
You should make it till then.

870
01:20:34,729 --> 01:20:37,230
Felix, my brother, and I...

871
01:20:37,231 --> 01:20:40,599
we robbed an armored car, outside of Stockton.

872
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,202
The job went bad.

873
01:20:42,203 --> 01:20:44,737
I think we got burned by our crew.

874
01:20:44,738 --> 01:20:47,139
Felix was killed at the meetup,

875
01:20:47,140 --> 01:20:50,277
which was here, at the El Royale.

876
01:20:50,278 --> 01:20:53,913
We had a plan in case things went south.

877
01:20:53,914 --> 01:20:56,586
Bury the money in the floor of the room.

878
01:20:58,586 --> 01:21:01,287
I couldn't remember what room we said.

879
01:21:01,288 --> 01:21:04,892
It was either four or five.

880
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,693
It's true what I told you back there.

881
01:21:07,694 --> 01:21:11,497
My mind, it isn't what it was.

882
01:21:11,498 --> 01:21:13,002
I guessed wrong.

883
01:21:16,002 --> 01:21:17,770
So, I think there's a bunch of money

884
01:21:17,771 --> 01:21:19,011
buried in your room, Darlene...

885
01:21:21,009 --> 01:21:23,649
and I need your help to get it.

886
01:21:30,917 --> 01:21:33,252
You expect me to believe all that?

887
01:21:33,253 --> 01:21:36,494
Well, it's the truth.

888
01:21:40,494 --> 01:21:42,161
It's the truth, so there is that.

889
01:21:42,162 --> 01:21:44,069
But, no, I get it.

890
01:21:49,069 --> 01:21:50,371
How did you know I wasn't

891
01:21:50,372 --> 01:21:52,608
on the up and up in the first place?

892
01:21:53,608 --> 01:21:55,142
You spend your life getting shook,

893
01:21:55,143 --> 01:21:56,383
you learn how to spot a shaker.

894
01:21:58,078 --> 01:21:59,979
Is that from a song?

895
01:21:59,980 --> 01:22:01,614
No.

896
01:22:01,615 --> 01:22:04,216
If you'd have been wrong...

897
01:22:04,217 --> 01:22:07,187
you'd have bashed a priest in the face for no reason.

898
01:22:07,188 --> 01:22:09,723
I would've found a way to forgive myself.

899
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:11,992
Yeah, I guess I'd have done the same thing

900
01:22:11,993 --> 01:22:14,160
in your situation.

901
01:22:14,161 --> 01:22:15,161
And now?

902
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,467
What would you do if you were me?

903
01:22:21,467 --> 01:22:23,236
Well, my first impulse would be

904
01:22:23,237 --> 01:22:25,304
to shoot the old man in the face...

905
01:22:25,305 --> 01:22:26,974
and clear out of Dodge.

906
01:22:26,975 --> 01:22:28,274
You're dead right.

907
01:22:28,275 --> 01:22:30,143
Oh, but I would think that through.

908
01:22:30,144 --> 01:22:31,944
You know, the cars aren't working.

909
01:22:31,945 --> 01:22:33,813
The storm's not lettin' up.

910
01:22:33,814 --> 01:22:34,974
People are gonna come looking

911
01:22:35,048 --> 01:22:36,983
for that dead cop soon enough...

912
01:22:36,984 --> 01:22:38,684
and I don't want to be the black woman

913
01:22:38,685 --> 01:22:41,493
in the woods at night with a gun when they do.

914
01:22:45,493 --> 01:22:49,295
So then, I'd start thinking about my other options.

915
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:52,499
I suppose I could go back in there...

916
01:22:52,500 --> 01:22:55,367
take my chances with those kids.

917
01:22:55,368 --> 01:22:57,903
I promise you I'm not thinking that.

918
01:22:57,904 --> 01:23:01,976
Which leads me to option three.

919
01:23:02,976 --> 01:23:08,314
Maybe I hear the old man out, maybe he's telling the truth.

920
01:23:08,315 --> 01:23:12,153
Maybe there really is money buried in my room.

921
01:23:13,153 --> 01:23:15,621
Maybe the old man...

922
01:23:15,622 --> 01:23:18,491
he doesn't have a lot of time left.

923
01:23:18,492 --> 01:23:24,598
He's fine with 50% of whatever we find in that floor.

924
01:23:24,599 --> 01:23:27,103
If I'm wrong, I can still shoot him later, huh?

925
01:23:29,103 --> 01:23:31,772
But if I'm right...

926
01:23:31,773 --> 01:23:34,710
I might just survive tonight.

927
01:23:36,710 --> 01:23:39,278
If I'm right...

928
01:23:39,279 --> 01:23:41,214
I can walk out of here with enough money

929
01:23:41,215 --> 01:23:43,229
to change my life forever.

930
01:23:55,229 --> 01:23:58,500
How much money are we talking exactly?

931
01:24:36,837 --> 01:24:38,207
So...

932
01:24:40,207 --> 01:24:42,011
What is this? Some kind of pervert hotel?

933
01:24:44,011 --> 01:24:45,745
Hey.

934
01:24:45,746 --> 01:24:47,980
No.

935
01:24:47,981 --> 01:24:48,981
Yes...

936
01:24:49,048 --> 01:24:51,251
I don't know.

937
01:24:53,421 --> 01:24:55,487
You just shot me in the face.

938
01:24:55,488 --> 01:24:58,393
Well, now, let's be clear.

939
01:24:59,393 --> 01:25:02,862
I shot another man who had it comin'...

940
01:25:02,863 --> 01:25:06,500
and you just happened to be back there being creepy...

941
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:10,971
and you caught a face full of buckshot for your trouble.

942
01:25:11,971 --> 01:25:14,107
Wait, hold still a sec.

943
01:25:15,609 --> 01:25:17,720
You got glass in your head.

944
01:25:26,720 --> 01:25:28,461
How does it look?

945
01:25:33,461 --> 01:25:35,495
To be honest, I don't remember

946
01:25:35,496 --> 01:25:36,862
what you looked like before this.

947
01:25:36,863 --> 01:25:39,331
But I think you should make peace

948
01:25:39,332 --> 01:25:41,840
with the fact that things have changed.

949
01:25:46,840 --> 01:25:48,677
Are you gonna kill me?

950
01:25:51,677 --> 01:25:54,048
How can I not after what you've seen?

951
01:25:55,048 --> 01:25:56,048
I seen worse.

952
01:25:57,885 --> 01:25:59,219
And I ain't said a thing.

953
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:01,455
You've seen worse than a man

954
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:04,124
getting sawn in half with a shotgun?

955
01:26:04,125 --> 01:26:06,162
I seen all sorts of bad.

956
01:26:08,162 --> 01:26:10,697
I seen, um...

957
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:14,901
a senator beat up a whore so bad...

958
01:26:14,902 --> 01:26:16,670
she had to shove her own stockings

959
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:18,371
back where her teeth used to be...

960
01:26:18,372 --> 01:26:21,875
just to keep from bleeding out through the mouth.

961
01:26:21,876 --> 01:26:24,743
I saw...

962
01:26:24,744 --> 01:26:29,148
a junkie paint "Sorry" on the wall in his own filth.

963
01:26:29,149 --> 01:26:31,585
Like that'd make it easier

964
01:26:31,586 --> 01:26:35,394
when I cleaned all that shit off his cold body.

965
01:26:40,394 --> 01:26:43,199
I saw a man lay with a wolf once.

966
01:26:46,199 --> 01:26:49,335
Guy drags a full-grown feral wolf

967
01:26:49,336 --> 01:26:52,971
on a choke chain into his room...

968
01:26:52,972 --> 01:26:55,311
ties it up to the bed...

969
01:26:58,311 --> 01:27:01,647
and takes off all his clothes...

970
01:27:01,648 --> 01:27:05,688
climbs into bed beside it, and holds the thing.

971
01:27:06,688 --> 01:27:08,591
All night.

972
01:27:11,591 --> 01:27:13,328
It wasn't sexual...

973
01:27:15,328 --> 01:27:18,297
but it wasn't not sexual, either.

974
01:27:20,600 --> 01:27:23,202
Guy just laid there crying, sayin', "Help me..."

975
01:27:23,203 --> 01:27:26,740
while he held that wolf.

976
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:29,845
All night.

977
01:27:32,845 --> 01:27:35,782
I never told nobody about none of that.

978
01:27:35,783 --> 01:27:37,584
Oh...

979
01:27:37,585 --> 01:27:41,621
I ain't so sure you should've told me that.

980
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:46,727
Uh...

981
01:27:49,529 --> 01:27:52,564
You don't have to kill me.

982
01:27:52,565 --> 01:27:54,267
What could I even say about you, anyway?

983
01:27:54,268 --> 01:27:57,804
"Some girls shot some guy who was gonna shoot them"?

984
01:27:57,805 --> 01:27:59,839
I don't even know your names.

985
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:00,974
I'm Rose.

986
01:28:00,975 --> 01:28:02,375
Don't say...

987
01:28:02,376 --> 01:28:03,776
Rose Summerspring.

988
01:28:03,777 --> 01:28:05,277
Oh.

989
01:28:05,278 --> 01:28:06,367
That's my sister, Emily.

990
01:28:28,034 --> 01:28:29,771
What's your name?

991
01:28:31,771 --> 01:28:33,810
Miles.

992
01:28:36,810 --> 01:28:37,810
Miles Miller.

993
01:28:38,045 --> 01:28:40,188
Well, it's nice to meet you, Miles.

994
01:28:47,188 --> 01:28:49,757
Where are the others?

995
01:34:23,122 --> 01:34:25,658
Rose? That's your name, right?

996
01:34:25,659 --> 01:34:28,930
Please, Rose. Please don't kill me.

997
01:34:30,930 --> 01:34:33,604
It ain't entirely up to me.

998
01:34:37,604 --> 01:34:39,337
You can talk to her.

999
01:34:39,338 --> 01:34:42,743
She's your sister, she'll listen to you.

1000
01:34:43,743 --> 01:34:46,278
It ain't up to her either.

1001
01:34:46,279 --> 01:34:48,386
Well, who's it up to?

1002
01:35:05,931 --> 01:35:08,233
Where's the priest?

1003
01:35:11,537 --> 01:35:12,871
Miles...

1004
01:35:12,872 --> 01:35:15,375
I don't know.

1005
01:35:15,376 --> 01:35:17,786
But you do know something, don't you?

1006
01:35:26,786 --> 01:35:28,560
Is this yours?

1007
01:35:32,560 --> 01:35:34,900
Do you want it?

1008
01:35:40,900 --> 01:35:42,734
Where's the priest?

1009
01:35:42,735 --> 01:35:44,069
I don't know.

1010
01:35:46,172 --> 01:35:47,572
I promise.

1011
01:35:47,573 --> 01:35:49,774
I wanna find him too.

1012
01:35:49,775 --> 01:35:51,643
Please.

1013
01:35:51,644 --> 01:35:53,048
I'll do whatever you want.

1014
01:35:56,048 --> 01:35:59,122
Just let me talk to the priest when you find him.

1015
01:36:03,122 --> 01:36:06,095
Just let me talk to him before you kill me.

1016
01:36:08,095 --> 01:36:09,327
I've been trying to tell him

1017
01:36:09,328 --> 01:36:10,931
that we might not have to kill him.

1018
01:36:12,931 --> 01:36:15,203
But it's not up to us.

1019
01:36:17,203 --> 01:36:19,176
Who's it up to, Rose?

1020
01:36:23,176 --> 01:36:25,154
Rose, what did you do?

1021
01:37:08,756 --> 01:37:10,270
Howdy.

1022
01:37:57,270 --> 01:38:00,139
So how long you lookin' to stay with us?

1023
01:38:00,140 --> 01:38:03,576
However long my sister stays, I suppose.

1024
01:38:03,577 --> 01:38:05,176
No, you don't get to be a part of the family

1025
01:38:05,177 --> 01:38:06,511
just 'cause you're kin.

1026
01:38:06,512 --> 01:38:08,413
Why do you wanna be here?

1027
01:38:08,414 --> 01:38:11,886
Rosie says you treat her pretty nice.

1028
01:38:12,886 --> 01:38:14,257
I appreciate that.

1029
01:38:18,257 --> 01:38:21,462
What does God mean to you?

1030
01:38:22,462 --> 01:38:24,830
What does God mean to all of you?

1031
01:38:24,831 --> 01:38:27,599
Is He some being in the sky?

1032
01:38:27,600 --> 01:38:29,167
Do you pray to Him at night?

1033
01:38:29,168 --> 01:38:31,104
Do you ask Him to watch over you?

1034
01:38:32,104 --> 01:38:34,840
Is He here with us now?

1035
01:38:34,841 --> 01:38:37,710
Or maybe there is no God, huh?

1036
01:38:37,711 --> 01:38:39,247
Maybe it's all lies.

1037
01:38:41,247 --> 01:38:43,447
Listen, I ain't saying I got it all figured out.

1038
01:38:43,448 --> 01:38:46,952
I'm not. But I do see the game.

1039
01:38:46,953 --> 01:38:51,691
They define right and wrong, and then they make you choose.

1040
01:38:51,692 --> 01:38:53,892
And that's how it all starts, with a simple choice...

1041
01:38:53,893 --> 01:38:55,426
which side are you on?

1042
01:38:55,427 --> 01:38:58,065
Up, down? Good, evil? Right, wrong?

1043
01:38:59,065 --> 01:39:02,201
God or no God? It's simple, just pick.

1044
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:05,537
Boots. Quick. Choose. Are you good or are you bad?

1045
01:39:05,538 --> 01:39:06,971
I'm neither.

1046
01:39:08,542 --> 01:39:09,841
Now, she's cheating 'cause she knows

1047
01:39:09,842 --> 01:39:11,176
what answer I'm looking for.

1048
01:39:11,177 --> 01:39:12,478
Boots, I'm giving a whole speech here

1049
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:14,199
in front of people. Don't mess it up for me.

1050
01:39:15,849 --> 01:39:17,617
They'll get you to pick.

1051
01:39:17,618 --> 01:39:18,751
Watch.

1052
01:39:18,752 --> 01:39:20,118
I'll do it right now.

1053
01:39:20,119 --> 01:39:22,023
I'll do it right now with my star pupil.

1054
01:39:23,023 --> 01:39:24,489
Boots, why don't you come up here

1055
01:39:24,490 --> 01:39:26,490
and help me out for a sec?

1056
01:39:26,859 --> 01:39:28,227
And, what about...

1057
01:39:28,228 --> 01:39:29,894
Millie, why don't you come join us, too.

1058
01:39:29,895 --> 01:39:32,895
Come on.

1059
01:39:33,365 --> 01:39:35,136
We're gonna have ourselves a tussle tonight.

1060
01:39:37,671 --> 01:39:39,470
It's been a while since we've had a tussle, right?

1061
01:39:39,471 --> 01:39:41,907
Oh, but wait a second. Rosie don't wanna tussle.

1062
01:39:41,908 --> 01:39:45,144
She's smart enough to know not to play the game, right?

1063
01:39:45,145 --> 01:39:47,246
But this is how I get her.

1064
01:39:47,247 --> 01:39:49,681
I dangle something she really wants.

1065
01:39:49,682 --> 01:39:53,318
You two are gonna have a proper tussle tonight...

1066
01:39:53,319 --> 01:39:55,086
and the winner...

1067
01:39:55,087 --> 01:39:57,156
Well, the winner gets to sleep with me

1068
01:39:57,157 --> 01:39:58,717
in the big house tonight. How'd that be?

1069
01:39:59,059 --> 01:40:00,559
See?

1070
01:40:00,560 --> 01:40:04,162
Now we got skin in the game, as they say.

1071
01:40:04,163 --> 01:40:06,631
So what do you think, Boots? You wanna play?

1072
01:40:06,632 --> 01:40:07,966
Yes.

1073
01:40:07,967 --> 01:40:09,334
So, pick a side.

1074
01:40:09,335 --> 01:40:11,972
Do you wanna be Right or do you wanna be Wrong?

1075
01:40:12,972 --> 01:40:14,105
I wanna be Right.

1076
01:40:14,106 --> 01:40:15,541
She wants to be Right.

1077
01:40:15,542 --> 01:40:17,309
Well, Millie, I guess that makes you Wrong.

1078
01:40:17,310 --> 01:40:19,644
Let's have ourselves an allegory.

1079
01:40:23,682 --> 01:40:25,384
All right. Have at it.

1080
01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:30,822
Whoa. Easy, Emily.

1081
01:40:30,823 --> 01:40:33,264
She's a big girl. She can take care of herself.

1082
01:40:38,264 --> 01:40:40,499
Now, here's the important part.

1083
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:42,768
While they're fighting, what am I doing, huh?

1084
01:40:42,769 --> 01:40:45,103
'Cause I sure as hell ain't fighting. What am I doing?

1085
01:40:45,104 --> 01:40:46,639
I'm watching them.

1086
01:40:46,640 --> 01:40:48,506
I'm getting off on it. Then I'm coming over here...

1087
01:40:48,507 --> 01:40:50,542
and I'm takin' what's theirs.

1088
01:40:50,543 --> 01:40:52,176
And they didn't even notice...

1089
01:40:52,177 --> 01:40:55,649
'cause they're too busy playing my game.

1090
01:40:58,650 --> 01:40:59,919
All right, all right.

1091
01:40:59,920 --> 01:41:01,720
Rosie, Rosie.

1092
01:41:01,721 --> 01:41:03,622
Come on. Hey, okay, okay.

1093
01:41:03,623 --> 01:41:06,591
All right, all right. Tussle's over, okay?

1094
01:41:06,592 --> 01:41:08,260
Okay, tussle's over.

1095
01:41:08,261 --> 01:41:10,461
Rosie, Rosie.

1096
01:41:10,462 --> 01:41:12,462
Hey, tussle's over.

1097
01:41:13,032 --> 01:41:15,970
Love each other.

1098
01:41:17,970 --> 01:41:19,237
All right, all right.

1099
01:41:19,238 --> 01:41:22,314
You did good. Both did good. Okay.

1100
01:41:27,314 --> 01:41:29,915
So, what have we learned, huh?

1101
01:41:29,916 --> 01:41:33,488
Maybe we won't play their games no more.

1102
01:41:35,488 --> 01:41:38,659
Maybe we won't listen to their lies.

1103
01:41:39,659 --> 01:41:43,594
Maybe the only truth in this world is right here.

1104
01:41:43,595 --> 01:41:45,032
And here.

1105
01:41:46,032 --> 01:41:47,232
And here...

1106
01:41:47,233 --> 01:41:48,867
and here, and here...

1107
01:41:48,868 --> 01:41:50,841
and here. Just us.

1108
01:41:54,841 --> 01:41:56,841
And maybe for tonight...

1109
01:41:56,842 --> 01:41:59,243
we get to be our own Gods.

1110
01:42:55,100 --> 01:42:56,501
Father Flynn.

1111
01:42:56,502 --> 01:42:58,737
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1112
01:42:58,738 --> 01:42:59,738
Please, Father...

1113
01:43:00,039 --> 01:43:02,642
Kid, if you don't shut up, I'm gonna tie your mouth shut.

1114
01:43:02,643 --> 01:43:05,810
Father, please, forgive me for the sins of my life.

1115
01:43:05,811 --> 01:43:07,813
Please, Father...

1116
01:43:07,814 --> 01:43:08,814
No, no, no.

1117
01:43:18,824 --> 01:43:19,824
Hmm.

1118
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:36,809
So, I'm guessing you're Father Flynn.

1119
01:43:36,810 --> 01:43:39,879
Which makes the dead guy Laramie Seymour Sullivan.

1120
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:45,184
And you, miss, must be Darlene Sweet. Hmm?

1121
01:43:45,185 --> 01:43:48,520
Well, I suppose you could be Fuck You...

1122
01:43:48,521 --> 01:43:50,591
but, uh, something tells me that's my Emily here.

1123
01:43:51,591 --> 01:43:53,027
Any other people in the hotel?

1124
01:43:54,027 --> 01:43:55,996
Hmm?

1125
01:43:56,996 --> 01:43:58,462
Wade, Annabell...

1126
01:43:58,463 --> 01:43:59,764
stand behind these four,

1127
01:43:59,765 --> 01:44:01,233
and if they try to get out of those seats...

1128
01:44:01,234 --> 01:44:02,701
you just shoot 'em in the back of the head.

1129
01:44:02,702 --> 01:44:04,569
Flicker, Roman, come here.

1130
01:44:04,570 --> 01:44:07,272
Go to room seven, get the dead guy...

1131
01:44:07,273 --> 01:44:08,439
and put all of his stuff

1132
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:10,209
and the body in the trunk of the car.

1133
01:44:10,210 --> 01:44:12,178
Then go room to room, see if you can find anybody else.

1134
01:44:12,179 --> 01:44:13,912
If you can, you bring 'em here.

1135
01:44:13,913 --> 01:44:15,479
What about them?

1136
01:44:15,480 --> 01:44:16,614
Well, first I got some questions

1137
01:44:16,615 --> 01:44:17,883
that need answering.

1138
01:44:17,884 --> 01:44:19,824
But leave some room in the trunk.

1139
01:44:25,824 --> 01:44:27,694
Hiya, Em.

1140
01:44:28,694 --> 01:44:29,694
Billy Lee.

1141
01:44:30,563 --> 01:44:32,399
You know, uh...

1142
01:44:33,399 --> 01:44:35,573
you left without saying goodbye.

1143
01:44:39,573 --> 01:44:43,407
What'd you think, I wouldn't take offense? Hmm?

1144
01:44:43,408 --> 01:44:45,645
Naw, I figured you would.

1145
01:44:46,645 --> 01:44:48,916
But I'd be ready when you did.

1146
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:51,086
You don't look ready.

1147
01:44:54,487 --> 01:44:56,724
You caught me on a bad night.

1148
01:44:57,724 --> 01:44:59,327
Ain't that the luck, huh?

1149
01:45:01,327 --> 01:45:03,801
Did you tell 'em what she did? Hmm?

1150
01:45:07,801 --> 01:45:10,372
Did you tell them what she did?

1151
01:45:12,372 --> 01:45:13,973
What'd I do?

1152
01:45:22,280 --> 01:45:23,384
Oh, right.

1153
01:45:25,384 --> 01:45:26,384
Sorry about all that.

1154
01:45:30,023 --> 01:45:31,560
She's sorry.

1155
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,361
It's all right, Boots. We'll deal with that

1156
01:45:36,362 --> 01:45:37,996
when we get back to California.

1157
01:45:37,997 --> 01:45:41,499
We got us a Nevada problem now.

1158
01:45:41,500 --> 01:45:44,068
So, uh, Miles...

1159
01:45:44,069 --> 01:45:46,774
What is this? Some sort of pervert hotel?

1160
01:45:47,774 --> 01:45:49,308
Kid can't answer you.

1161
01:45:49,309 --> 01:45:51,443
You tied his mouth shut.

1162
01:45:51,444 --> 01:45:53,845
Well, why don't I ask you then? Huh?

1163
01:45:53,846 --> 01:45:55,486
Why don't I ask the priest who was walking

1164
01:45:56,048 --> 01:45:57,688
out of the hotel with a bag full of money?

1165
01:45:59,051 --> 01:46:00,087
All right.

1166
01:46:02,087 --> 01:46:05,025
Yeah. I think it's some sort of pervert hotel.

1167
01:46:06,025 --> 01:46:07,225
Huh.

1168
01:46:07,226 --> 01:46:10,728
The kid told me, he films people doing whatnot...

1169
01:46:10,729 --> 01:46:12,201
and sends it to his bosses.

1170
01:46:15,201 --> 01:46:16,934
Who are his bosses?

1171
01:46:16,935 --> 01:46:20,006
People who own the hotel. I don't know.

1172
01:46:21,006 --> 01:46:22,743
Does it really matter?

1173
01:46:23,743 --> 01:46:25,243
Maybe.

1174
01:46:26,311 --> 01:46:30,520
And what, he just offered this up to you, did he? Hmm?

1175
01:46:33,520 --> 01:46:36,554
I think he was trying to confess.

1176
01:46:36,555 --> 01:46:38,622
Oh.

1177
01:46:38,623 --> 01:46:40,027
I think it's been weighing on him.

1178
01:46:41,027 --> 01:46:44,429
I think he's trying to confess right now...

1179
01:46:44,430 --> 01:46:47,467
because he knows how this is gonna go...

1180
01:46:48,467 --> 01:46:50,836
and he fears for his soul.

1181
01:46:55,207 --> 01:46:57,608
Hey, buddy. Uh...

1182
01:46:57,609 --> 01:47:00,078
Listen, if you're so worried about your soul...

1183
01:47:00,079 --> 01:47:01,612
maybe you shouldn't have been doing

1184
01:47:01,613 --> 01:47:04,829
all this bad shit in the first place.

1185
01:47:17,829 --> 01:47:19,432
Is that who I think it is?

1186
01:47:20,432 --> 01:47:21,536
I wanna see.

1187
01:47:23,536 --> 01:47:25,738
Now, wait a second.

1188
01:47:26,738 --> 01:47:28,239
What's a man of God like yourself

1189
01:47:28,240 --> 01:47:30,341
doing with this in his coat?

1190
01:47:30,342 --> 01:47:31,675
It's just people fuckin'.

1191
01:47:31,676 --> 01:47:34,082
No. You take a closer look, Rose.

1192
01:47:36,082 --> 01:47:37,082
Wait, I know him.

1193
01:47:37,083 --> 01:47:38,518
Uh-huh.

1194
01:47:39,518 --> 01:47:40,920
He's dead.

1195
01:47:40,921 --> 01:47:42,520
That he is.

1196
01:47:42,521 --> 01:47:44,059
That he is.

1197
01:47:47,059 --> 01:47:48,895
All right.

1198
01:47:49,895 --> 01:47:52,264
Where's the money come from?

1199
01:47:52,265 --> 01:47:53,698
Well, that money...

1200
01:47:53,699 --> 01:47:56,104
I ain't asking you right now, Father.

1201
01:47:59,104 --> 01:48:02,974
Ms. Darlene Sweet, where's the money come from, hmm?

1202
01:48:02,975 --> 01:48:04,408
It's mine.

1203
01:48:04,409 --> 01:48:07,179
It's yours?

1204
01:48:07,180 --> 01:48:08,414
Really?

1205
01:48:09,414 --> 01:48:11,349
Where's a girl like you

1206
01:48:11,350 --> 01:48:13,154
get all this kind of money from, huh?

1207
01:48:15,154 --> 01:48:16,155
I earned it.

1208
01:48:17,155 --> 01:48:18,323
Singing.

1209
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:23,929
Well, you must be one hell of a singer then.

1210
01:48:23,930 --> 01:48:25,703
I am.

1211
01:48:30,703 --> 01:48:33,404
All right, your turn.

1212
01:48:33,405 --> 01:48:35,407
Where's the money from? Hmm?

1213
01:48:35,408 --> 01:48:37,975
She's telling you the truth.

1214
01:48:37,976 --> 01:48:40,679
That's her money, she earned it singing.

1215
01:48:40,680 --> 01:48:44,349
Yeah, and you're a man of the cloth, huh?

1216
01:48:44,350 --> 01:48:46,184
I am.

1217
01:48:46,185 --> 01:48:47,705
You know, I forgot to mention...

1218
01:48:53,692 --> 01:48:56,631
I hate priests.

1219
01:48:58,631 --> 01:49:00,007
You wanna change your story?

1220
01:49:09,007 --> 01:49:10,246
Nope.

1221
01:49:13,246 --> 01:49:14,246
Alrighty then.

1222
01:49:17,015 --> 01:49:18,916
Boots, why don't you find something

1223
01:49:18,917 --> 01:49:21,086
to listen to on that there jukebox?

1224
01:49:21,087 --> 01:49:23,321
It's too quiet in here, don't you think? Huh?

1225
01:49:23,322 --> 01:49:25,472
Gives me the willies.

1226
01:49:57,222 --> 01:49:58,993
Who is this?

1227
01:50:00,993 --> 01:50:02,929
Um...

1228
01:50:03,929 --> 01:50:05,333
It's Deep Purple, I think.

1229
01:50:07,333 --> 01:50:08,702
Uh...

1230
01:50:09,702 --> 01:50:11,639
It's not for me.

1231
01:50:35,961 --> 01:50:38,197
Now, I want you two to pay

1232
01:50:38,198 --> 01:50:40,532
real close attention to what happens next, okay?

1233
01:50:40,533 --> 01:50:43,300
And keep it right up there in the front of your minds...

1234
01:50:43,301 --> 01:50:44,270
when I'm asking questions

1235
01:50:44,271 --> 01:50:47,738
looking for truthful answers, okay?

1236
01:50:47,739 --> 01:50:48,739
All right.

1237
01:50:49,042 --> 01:50:50,810
Emily.

1238
01:50:51,810 --> 01:50:54,145
Pick a color.

1239
01:50:54,146 --> 01:50:56,382
Red or black?

1240
01:50:57,382 --> 01:50:58,452
No.

1241
01:50:59,452 --> 01:51:00,853
No?

1242
01:51:00,854 --> 01:51:04,121
Well, that's just not hardly nice.

1243
01:51:04,122 --> 01:51:06,692
I'm offering you a chance here, right?

1244
01:51:06,693 --> 01:51:07,992
On account of the fact that

1245
01:51:07,993 --> 01:51:09,827
we're practically family, all right?

1246
01:51:09,828 --> 01:51:10,828
And that's downright

1247
01:51:11,064 --> 01:51:12,930
charitable of me, considering...

1248
01:51:12,931 --> 01:51:14,835
Boots, you hearing what your sister's doing?

1249
01:51:15,835 --> 01:51:19,470
Em, if Billy Lee is offering you a chance,

1250
01:51:19,471 --> 01:51:21,551
I think you should take it.

1251
01:51:33,551 --> 01:51:35,554
Did you think you could just take what's mine,

1252
01:51:35,555 --> 01:51:37,522
and I wouldn't come a-huntin'?

1253
01:51:41,359 --> 01:51:43,560
She ain't yours.

1254
01:51:43,561 --> 01:51:45,298
Rosie, are you mine?

1255
01:51:46,298 --> 01:51:47,902
Of course.

1256
01:51:49,902 --> 01:51:51,206
Of course.

1257
01:51:53,206 --> 01:51:56,441
There was no violence till you.

1258
01:51:56,442 --> 01:51:58,912
Yeah, maybe.

1259
01:51:59,912 --> 01:52:01,748
Maybe not.

1260
01:52:03,748 --> 01:52:06,341
But it's there now, isn't it?

1261
01:52:29,341 --> 01:52:31,345
Pick a color, Em. I ain't asking again.

1262
01:52:38,516 --> 01:52:40,520
Pick a color.

1263
01:52:41,520 --> 01:52:43,091
Pick a color.

1264
01:52:45,091 --> 01:52:46,091
Red.

1265
01:52:50,061 --> 01:52:52,164
I guess that makes you black, altar boy.

1266
01:52:53,164 --> 01:52:55,166
What? No, no, no.

1267
01:52:55,167 --> 01:52:57,536
Come here. You got some prayers, you can say 'em now.

1268
01:52:57,537 --> 01:52:59,103
Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned.

1269
01:52:59,104 --> 01:53:00,772
I have done so much worse than you know.

1270
01:53:00,773 --> 01:53:02,174
Kid...

1271
01:53:02,175 --> 01:53:04,309
Father Flynn, I have sinned and I repent.

1272
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:05,911
Forgive me, Father.

1273
01:53:05,912 --> 01:53:07,711
I have sinned and I...

1274
01:53:07,712 --> 01:53:09,214
Father Flynn, please!

1275
01:53:09,215 --> 01:53:10,983
Do you want to tell him or you want me to do it?

1276
01:53:10,984 --> 01:53:12,149
I have sinned and I repent!

1277
01:53:12,150 --> 01:53:13,150
Miles...

1278
01:53:12,150 --> 01:53:13,451
Please!

1279
01:53:13,452 --> 01:53:14,452
Forgive me, Father!

1280
01:53:14,453 --> 01:53:17,688
He's not a fucking priest, kid!

1281
01:53:25,631 --> 01:53:29,734
Well, it looks like the Lord hasn't forsaken you yet.

1282
01:53:29,735 --> 01:53:30,735
No!

1283
01:54:48,247 --> 01:54:50,618
Now then, who wants to play next?

1284
01:54:51,618 --> 01:54:53,285
Ah, whoa, Wade, Annabell...

1285
01:54:53,286 --> 01:54:54,885
keep a close eye there.

1286
01:54:54,886 --> 01:54:56,153
See, everyone's liable to get a little more squirrelly

1287
01:54:56,154 --> 01:54:57,154
now they know the stakes.

1288
01:54:59,024 --> 01:55:00,962
You two gonna be more forthcoming?

1289
01:55:02,962 --> 01:55:04,631
Sure.

1290
01:55:06,631 --> 01:55:08,802
Could I have some of that whiskey?

1291
01:55:10,802 --> 01:55:12,702
Yeah, sure. Why not?

1292
01:55:12,703 --> 01:55:16,286
Boots, can you pour the padre a glass, please?

1293
01:55:27,286 --> 01:55:29,324
I can't do it anymore.

1294
01:55:32,324 --> 01:55:33,324
I can't...

1295
01:55:32,324 --> 01:55:33,791
Hey, kid...

1296
01:55:33,792 --> 01:55:35,126
if you don't shut the fuck up,

1297
01:55:35,127 --> 01:55:36,647
I'm gonna make you play the game again.

1298
01:55:43,135 --> 01:55:46,273
So, let's try this again.

1299
01:55:47,273 --> 01:55:48,675
Where's the money from?

1300
01:55:49,675 --> 01:55:50,875
I stole it...

1301
01:55:50,876 --> 01:55:53,278
about a decade ago.

1302
01:55:53,279 --> 01:55:55,880
I hid it here, did some time...

1303
01:55:55,881 --> 01:55:58,081
got out a few days ago...

1304
01:55:58,082 --> 01:56:02,153
came back tonight to retrieve it.

1305
01:56:02,154 --> 01:56:03,674
Why you dressed up like a priest, then?

1306
01:56:06,091 --> 01:56:08,526
Didn't want too many questions.

1307
01:56:08,527 --> 01:56:10,193
People tend to look the other way

1308
01:56:10,194 --> 01:56:12,632
when you're wearin' a collar.

1309
01:56:14,632 --> 01:56:15,632
And you?

1310
01:56:16,469 --> 01:56:17,669
Um...

1311
01:56:17,670 --> 01:56:19,703
I'm just a singer.

1312
01:56:19,704 --> 01:56:22,206
The money happened to be hidden in my room.

1313
01:56:22,207 --> 01:56:23,327
He said he would split it...

1314
01:56:24,009 --> 01:56:26,176
if I could help him get it back.

1315
01:56:26,177 --> 01:56:29,680
Of course he did. Of course he did.

1316
01:56:29,681 --> 01:56:30,881
Yeah, yeah.

1317
01:56:30,882 --> 01:56:32,716
'Cause that ain't even the real score,

1318
01:56:32,717 --> 01:56:33,884
is it, padre, huh?

1319
01:56:33,885 --> 01:56:35,353
'Cause you found this.

1320
01:56:35,354 --> 01:56:37,488
I bet you he didn't even tell you about this, did he?

1321
01:56:37,489 --> 01:56:40,659
Huh? Don't you even wanna see who's in it?

1322
01:56:41,659 --> 01:56:43,560
No.

1323
01:56:43,561 --> 01:56:44,629
It doesn't matter.

1324
01:56:44,630 --> 01:56:45,730
Oh, no. Then, darlin',

1325
01:56:45,731 --> 01:56:47,451
you ain't understanding what's on this film.

1326
01:56:49,100 --> 01:56:50,935
Let me guess.

1327
01:56:50,936 --> 01:56:52,937
Um...

1328
01:56:52,938 --> 01:56:55,542
It's some man...

1329
01:56:56,542 --> 01:56:58,777
who talks...

1330
01:56:58,778 --> 01:57:00,913
a lot.

1331
01:57:01,913 --> 01:57:03,581
He talks so much

1332
01:57:03,582 --> 01:57:07,253
that he thinks he believes in something.

1333
01:57:08,253 --> 01:57:10,289
And really just...

1334
01:57:11,289 --> 01:57:14,658
wants to fuck who he wants to fuck.

1335
01:57:14,659 --> 01:57:16,594
I've seen it enough.

1336
01:57:16,595 --> 01:57:19,132
I'm not even mad about it anymore.

1337
01:57:21,132 --> 01:57:23,770
I'm just...

1338
01:57:24,770 --> 01:57:26,807
tired.

1339
01:57:28,807 --> 01:57:30,744
I'm just bored.

1340
01:57:32,744 --> 01:57:34,952
Of men like you.

1341
01:57:39,952 --> 01:57:43,358
You think I don't see you for who you really are?

1342
01:57:45,358 --> 01:57:48,225
A fragile little man.

1343
01:57:48,226 --> 01:57:52,770
Preying on the weak and lost.

1344
01:57:57,770 --> 01:57:58,770
Yeah, well, if I...

1345
01:57:58,771 --> 01:57:59,773
I've heard it.

1346
01:58:00,773 --> 01:58:03,211
And I don't care.

1347
01:58:05,211 --> 01:58:08,216
I'd rather sit here and listen to the rain.

1348
01:58:27,765 --> 01:58:29,940
You go right ahead.

1349
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:36,206
Why didn't you just leave

1350
01:58:36,207 --> 01:58:37,642
when you had the film?

1351
01:58:37,643 --> 01:58:40,911
It's worth way more than some bag of money.

1352
01:58:40,912 --> 01:58:44,314
I did time for that money.

1353
01:58:44,315 --> 01:58:47,352
My brother, he died for that money. That money's mine.

1354
01:58:47,353 --> 01:58:48,954
That money's ours.

1355
01:58:49,954 --> 01:58:51,322
That money's ours.

1356
01:58:51,323 --> 01:58:54,459
Why is that film worth so much anyway?

1357
01:58:54,460 --> 01:58:56,460
Guy's dead. Who cares?

1358
01:58:56,461 --> 01:58:57,895
Well, Boots...

1359
01:58:57,896 --> 01:58:59,397
sometimes the memory of a man

1360
01:58:59,398 --> 01:59:00,831
matters more than the man himself.

1361
01:59:00,832 --> 01:59:03,203
Ain't that right, padre?

1362
01:59:05,203 --> 01:59:07,610
Yeah, if you say so.

1363
01:59:12,610 --> 01:59:15,779
Who's gonna come looking for their money?

1364
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:16,881
Nobody.

1365
01:59:16,882 --> 01:59:18,515
Somebody's always looking for money!

1366
01:59:18,516 --> 01:59:20,988
No, they're all gone. Except me.

1367
01:59:22,988 --> 01:59:25,657
And who are you exactly?

1368
01:59:25,658 --> 01:59:27,425
Let's just say I wanna check this story out.

1369
01:59:27,426 --> 01:59:29,774
What's your real name, Father?

1370
01:59:52,752 --> 01:59:54,460
It's, uh...

1371
02:00:01,460 --> 02:00:03,965
Did I tell you my real name?

1372
02:00:05,965 --> 02:00:07,831
You never did. No.

1373
02:00:07,832 --> 02:00:09,733
Oh, really?

1374
02:00:09,734 --> 02:00:10,934
Now you wanna

1375
02:00:11,002 --> 02:00:12,903
Start playing games again?

1376
02:00:12,904 --> 02:00:14,606
He can't remember.

1377
02:00:15,606 --> 02:00:17,441
His mind's not all there.

1378
02:00:17,442 --> 02:00:19,943
That's what he told you?

1379
02:00:19,944 --> 02:00:21,246
He did.

1380
02:00:21,247 --> 02:00:23,181
And you believe anything this old crook says?

1381
02:00:24,181 --> 02:00:27,454
I believe that much. Yeah.

1382
02:00:29,454 --> 02:00:30,888
All right, all right.

1383
02:00:30,889 --> 02:00:33,090
Let's see if we can't jog his memory, huh, Darlene?

1384
02:00:33,091 --> 02:00:34,524
Pick a color.

1385
02:00:48,372 --> 02:00:50,043
Now it's quiet again.

1386
02:00:53,043 --> 02:00:55,513
I don't like it.

1387
02:00:55,514 --> 02:00:57,819
No, I don't like it either.

1388
02:01:01,819 --> 02:01:04,121
Hey, ain't you supposed to be a singer? Huh?

1389
02:01:04,122 --> 02:01:07,224
Why don't you sing something for us, Darlene.

1390
02:01:07,225 --> 02:01:08,492
No, thank you.

1391
02:01:08,493 --> 02:01:09,626
Hell, I'll tell you what.

1392
02:01:09,627 --> 02:01:10,747
If you sing something for us

1393
02:01:11,063 --> 02:01:12,462
and if you're as good as you say you are...

1394
02:01:12,463 --> 02:01:13,730
I won't make you play the game.

1395
02:01:13,731 --> 02:01:15,002
Don't do it.

1396
02:01:17,002 --> 02:01:18,870
He's gonna do what he's gonna do,

1397
02:01:18,871 --> 02:01:21,011
but he don't deserve to hear you sing.

1398
02:01:26,011 --> 02:01:27,681
Suit your fucking selves!

1399
02:01:29,681 --> 02:01:30,681
Wait...

1400
02:02:52,230 --> 02:02:53,436
I've heard better.

1401
02:03:21,793 --> 02:03:23,095
No! You'll hit Billy Lee!

1402
02:03:28,233 --> 02:03:29,599
No, I can't do it.

1403
02:03:29,600 --> 02:03:31,568
I can't do it no more.

1404
02:03:31,569 --> 02:03:32,889
- I can't. I can't do it. - Miles.

1405
02:03:33,005 --> 02:03:35,005
I can't kill no more people.

1406
02:03:33,005 --> 02:03:35,375
Miles!

1407
02:03:36,375 --> 02:03:37,375
Help us.

1408
02:03:39,344 --> 02:03:41,914
I can't kill no more people.

1409
02:03:43,914 --> 02:03:46,523
How many people have you killed, Miles?

1410
02:03:51,523 --> 02:03:53,701
123.

1411
02:04:06,470 --> 02:04:10,241
My heavens, Ginger! Look what your boy can do.

1412
02:04:10,242 --> 02:04:13,411
Miller! Why the fuck have you stopped shooting?

1413
02:06:00,853 --> 02:06:02,154
Miles.

1414
02:06:03,154 --> 02:06:04,654
I can't do it.

1415
02:06:04,655 --> 02:06:06,357
I can't kill no more people.

1416
02:06:06,358 --> 02:06:07,358
Miles...

1417
02:06:11,229 --> 02:06:13,663
It's all right.

1418
02:06:13,664 --> 02:06:15,545
You don't have to kill any more people.

1419
02:06:35,920 --> 02:06:38,592
Motherfucker!

1420
02:06:54,072 --> 02:06:55,840
Let's see if you can't remember this.

1421
02:07:04,483 --> 02:07:06,517
Easy there, altar boy...

1422
02:07:17,761 --> 02:07:19,368
Take the gun.

1423
02:08:36,807 --> 02:08:38,347
I'm sorry.

1424
02:08:51,288 --> 02:08:52,288
I'm so sorry.

1425
02:09:08,606 --> 02:09:10,606
No!

1426
02:09:35,432 --> 02:09:36,567
Help him.

1427
02:09:45,543 --> 02:09:47,948
I can't.

1428
02:09:50,948 --> 02:09:53,416
No, God. No, God, please.

1429
02:09:53,417 --> 02:09:55,087
Help him.

1430
02:10:00,824 --> 02:10:02,492
Please, God.

1431
02:10:02,493 --> 02:10:04,399
I don't wanna...

1432
02:10:08,399 --> 02:10:10,569
Confess.

1433
02:10:12,569 --> 02:10:14,345
My son, confess.

1434
02:10:21,345 --> 02:10:23,779
You're not a...

1435
02:10:23,780 --> 02:10:25,816
You're not a priest.

1436
02:10:25,817 --> 02:10:27,087
Of course I am.

1437
02:10:29,087 --> 02:10:33,357
Miles Miller, my name is Father Daniel Flynn...

1438
02:10:33,358 --> 02:10:36,005
and I'm here to absolve you of your sins.

1439
02:10:47,005 --> 02:10:49,672
Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.

1440
02:10:49,673 --> 02:10:51,444
Yes.

1441
02:10:52,444 --> 02:10:54,310
I've sinned.

1442
02:10:54,311 --> 02:10:57,949
I've sinned more times than I can count.

1443
02:10:58,949 --> 02:11:01,184
I've killed.

1444
02:11:01,185 --> 02:11:03,488
I've killed so many people.

1445
02:11:04,488 --> 02:11:06,555
I'm so sorry, Father.

1446
02:11:06,556 --> 02:11:07,890
It's all right.

1447
02:11:07,891 --> 02:11:09,028
No, it's not.

1448
02:11:10,028 --> 02:11:12,332
I did so much bad.

1449
02:11:14,332 --> 02:11:17,100
I lied. I stole.

1450
02:11:17,101 --> 02:11:19,336
I hurt people.

1451
02:11:19,337 --> 02:11:23,706
I did it all even though I know it was wrong.

1452
02:11:23,707 --> 02:11:26,645
I'm so sorry, Father.

1453
02:11:27,645 --> 02:11:30,917
Do you seek absolution for your sins?

1454
02:11:33,917 --> 02:11:35,618
Yes, I do.

1455
02:11:35,619 --> 02:11:39,822
Do you give yourself to the mercy of the Lord?

1456
02:11:39,823 --> 02:11:41,398
Yes.

1457
02:11:46,398 --> 02:11:49,005
Will you give to Him the time that you have left?

1458
02:11:54,005 --> 02:11:55,473
I'm too late.

1459
02:11:55,474 --> 02:11:57,174
No.

1460
02:11:57,175 --> 02:11:59,877
It's never too late.

1461
02:12:00,877 --> 02:12:03,948
Yes. I will try.

1462
02:12:04,948 --> 02:12:07,684
I'll try to be better.

1463
02:12:07,685 --> 02:12:10,422
I'll try to be a better man.

1464
02:12:12,422 --> 02:12:14,092
I repent.

1465
02:12:15,092 --> 02:12:17,497
Father Flynn, I repent.

1466
02:12:18,497 --> 02:12:20,502
You are forgiven.

1467
02:12:24,502 --> 02:12:26,269
Miles Miller.

1468
02:12:26,270 --> 02:12:28,006
In the name of the Father,

1469
02:12:29,006 --> 02:12:32,643
the Son, and the Holy Spirit...

1470
02:12:32,644 --> 02:12:34,113
you are forgiven.

1471
02:14:39,136 --> 02:14:40,779
Good luck, everyone.

1472
02:14:48,779 --> 02:14:52,282
And 47.

1473
02:14:52,283 --> 02:14:56,086
Now, we have got a special treat for you tonight.

1474
02:14:56,087 --> 02:14:57,453
Coming to you all the way

1475
02:14:57,454 --> 02:14:59,589
from beautiful Los Angeles, California...

1476
02:14:59,590 --> 02:15:03,661
Ladies and gentlemen, let's give a warm Reno welcome

1477
02:15:03,662 --> 02:15:05,661
to Darlene Sweet.

1478
02:15:14,805 --> 02:15:18,073
Thank y'all for coming to listen to me tonight.

1479
02:15:18,074 --> 02:15:20,046
It means a lot to me.

1480
02:18:31,835 --> 02:18:34,005
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1481
02:18:35,005 --> 02:18:36,874
That's very kind of you. Thank you.

1482
02:18:36,875 --> 02:18:39,408
God, come on in. There's enough room for everyone.

1483
02:18:39,409 --> 02:18:40,479
Come on in.

1484
02:18:42,479 --> 02:18:45,515
Now, if it's all right with you...

1485
02:18:45,516 --> 02:18:48,774
we'd like to do a few more for you now.
