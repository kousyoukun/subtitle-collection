they always leave out...

is that this place
lost its gambling license

Something to do with
the commission or some such.

So all the swells
took their business elsewhere.

out here?

Oh, I live in Bakersfield now,

singing in Reno tomorrow.

Oh, that's exciting.

I was visiting my brother
in Oakland...

507
00:45:07,663 --> 00:45:10,541
and, uh, I had to get off
the road before dark.

Well, my eyes,
they're no good at night.

something to you?

I think you should see
a doctor.

Yeah, I have, and he agrees
with my assessment

Felix, my brother, and I...

1001
01:20:37,624 --> 01:20:40,669
we robbed an armored car,
outside of Stockton.

1002

1003

by our crew.

1004

Felix was killed
at the meetup,

1005

which was here,
at the El Royale.

in case things went south.

It was either four or five.

It's true what I told you
back there.

1011
01:21:07,946 --> 01:21:10,991
My mind, it isn't what it was.

1012

I guessed wrong.

1013
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:17,956
So, I think
there's a bunch of money

1014
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,583
buried in your room,

1015

01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:36,600
Well, it's the truth.

1019
01:21:40,937 --> 01:21:42,439
It's the truth,
so there is that.

01:21:42,522 --> 01:21:44,900
But, no, I get it.

How did you know I wasn't

1022

in the first place?

the same thing

-(SIGHS)

What would you do
if you were me?

1034
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:23,521
Well, my first impulse
would be

1035
01:22:23,605 --> 01:22:25,523
to shoot the old man
in the face...

1036
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:27,108
and clear out of Dodge.

1037
01:22:27,275 --> 01:22:28,276
You're dead right.

1038
01:22:28,443 --> 01:22:30,320
Oh, but I would
think that through.

1039
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:32,155
You know,
the cars aren't working.

1040

The storm's not lettin' up.

1041
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,283
People are gonna come looking

1042
01:22:35,367 --> 01:22:37,118
for that dead cop
soon enough...

1043
01:22:37,285 --> 01:22:39,079
and I don't want to be
the black woman

1044
01:22:39,162 --> 01:22:42,040
in the woods at night
with a gun when they do.

1045
01:22:45,919 --> 01:22:49,506
So then, I'd start thinking
about my other options.

1046
01:22:49,673 --> 01:22:52,759
I suppose
I could go back in there...

1047
01:22:52,926 --> 01:22:55,595
take my chances
with those kids.

1048
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:57,305
I promise you
I'm not thinking that.

1049
01:22:58,181 --> 01:23:01,518
Which leads me
to option three.

1050
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:08,316
Maybe I hear the old man out,
maybe he's telling the truth.

1051
01:23:08,692 --> 01:23:12,362
Maybe there really is money
buried in my room.

1052
01:23:13,488 --> 01:23:15,198
Maybe the old man...

1053
01:23:16,074 --> 01:23:18,743
he doesn't have
a lot of time left.

1054
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:24,416
He's fine with 50% of whatever
we find in that floor.

1055
01:23:25,041 --> 01:23:27,919
If I'm wrong, I can still
shoot him later, huh?

1056
01:23:29,421 --> 01:23:31,381
But if I'm right...

1057
01:23:32,007 --> 01:23:34,718
I might just survive tonight.

1058
01:23:36,928 --> 01:23:38,555
If I'm right...

1059
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:41,474
I can walk out of here
with enough money

that he thinks
he believes in something.
