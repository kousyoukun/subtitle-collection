1
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:22,908
-我們今晚會抓到浣熊嗎，爸爸？    -最好是
{\fs12}-Think we'll get a coon tonight, Daddy?  -We'd better.{\r}

2
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:28,926
耶穌，你會降臨這裡嗎？
{\fs12}Jesus, will you come by here?{\r}

3
00:00:29,046 --> 00:00:32,667
哦，耶穌，你會降臨這裡嗎？
{\fs12}Oh, Jesus, will you come by here?{\r}

4
00:00:33,308 --> 00:00:37,931
耶穌，你會降臨這裡嗎？
{\fs12}Jesus, will you come by here?{\r}

5
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:42,722
現在是非常時期...
{\fs12}Now is a needy time...{\r}

6
00:00:42,842 --> 00:00:46,446
哦，現在是非常時期...
{\fs12}Oh, now is a needy time...{\r}

7
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,130
現在是非常時期
{\fs12}Now is a needy time.{\r}

8
00:00:54,962 --> 00:00:57,980
來吧，如果你不能久留...
{\fs12}Come, if you don't stay long...{\r}

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:01:01,576
哦，來吧，如果你不能久留...
{\fs12}Oh, come, if you don't stay long...{\r}

10
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,066
來吧，來吧，如果你不能久留
{\fs12}Come, if you don't stay long.{\r}

11
00:01:08,092 --> 00:01:10,900
現在是非常時期
{\fs12}Now is a needy time...{\r}

12
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,474
哦，現在是非常時期...
{\fs12}Oh, now is a needy time...{\r}

13
00:01:14,594 --> 00:01:19,229
耶穌，你不會降臨這裡嗎？
{\fs12}Jesus, won't you come by here?{\r}

14
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:23,651
他抓到一個了！快，男孩，我們走吧
{\fs12}He's got one already! Come on, boy, let's go.{\r}

15
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,713
我聽到你了，男孩，快！
{\fs12}I hear you, boy, come on!{\r}

16
00:01:49,807 --> 00:01:52,252
給我那盞燈，男孩，快，讓我們...
{\fs12}Give me that lamp, boy, come on, let's...{\r}

17
00:01:52,372 --> 00:01:53,141
天
{\fs12}Man.{\r}

18
00:01:57,141 --> 00:01:59,659
有了。現在快，男孩，我們走吧！
{\fs12}There it is. Now come on, boy, let's go!{\r}

19
00:02:03,807 --> 00:02:06,030
去吧，桑德！我聽到你了，快！
{\fs12}Go, Sounder! I hear you. Come on!{\r}

20
00:02:25,688 --> 00:02:30,503
他應該在樹叢裡抓到他了。老浣熊你完蛋了！
{\fs12}I think he's got him treed, boy. It's all over now for you, old coon!{\r}

21
00:02:31,836 --> 00:02:33,984
他在那。快，我們走
{\fs12}There he is. Come on, let's go.{\r}

22
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,450
桌上甜美的肉。我們聽到了，男孩。快！
{\fs12}Sweet meat on the table. We hear you, boy. Come on!{\r}

23
00:03:00,006 --> 00:03:01,043
射擊！
{\fs12}Shoot!{\r}

24
00:03:03,783 --> 00:03:04,746
該死的
{\fs12}Damn.{\r}

25
00:03:19,469 --> 00:03:22,432
哦，桑德，現在別放棄。快，男孩！
{\fs12}Oh, Sounder, don't give up now. Come on, boy!{\r}

26
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:30,209
那隻狗已經找到了。快，小子，我們走
{\fs12}That dog done found one already. Come on, sonny, let's go.{\r}

27
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,257
桑德！
{\fs12}Sounder!{\r}

28
00:03:52,109 --> 00:03:53,146
{\fs12}Sounder!{\r}

29
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:57,886
哇，開槍！
{\fs12}Aww, shoot!{\r}

30
00:04:10,701 --> 00:04:13,812
快，桑德，現在別放棄。快，男孩！
{\fs12}Come on, Sounder, don't give up now. Come on, boy!{\r}

31
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,317
該死！
{\fs12}Dammit!{\r}

32
00:04:55,984 --> 00:05:00,428
以前一隻公牛都無法阻止那條狗抓到那隻浣熊
{\fs12}I remember a time when a bull couldn't stop that dog from catching that coon.{\r}

33
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:33,594
沒關係，兒子
{\fs12}It's alright, son.{\r}

34
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:36,881
老桑德完成了他的工作
{\fs12}Old Sounder did his job.{\r}

35
00:05:37,001 --> 00:05:41,964
只是，當我想到餐桌上沒有肉時，我就...
{\fs12}It's just, when I realized there wasn't gonna be no meat on the table, I just...{\r}

36
00:05:42,084 --> 00:05:44,038
...一時表現得很愚蠢
{\fs12}...acted foolish for a minute.{\r}

37
00:05:45,297 --> 00:05:49,354
如果要怪人，就怪我吧，因為第一槍就該打中他
{\fs12}If anybody's to blame, it's me, 'cause I oughta nailed him on that first shot.{\r}

38
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:51,075
太暗了，爸爸
{\fs12}It's too dark, Daddy.{\r}

39
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,682
是啊
{\fs12}Yeah.{\r}

40
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,115
好吧...
{\fs12}Alright, well...{\r}

41
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,276
我們最好還是回木屋，桑德！
{\fs12}Well, I guess we better get on back to the cabin. Sounder!{\r}

42
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:22,112
你知道，兒子：沒有其他狗可以跟得上桑德
{\fs12}You know, son: there ain't no dog as good as Sounder.{\r}

43
00:06:22,964 --> 00:06:27,483
多年來，我們一直在樹林追逐浣熊和負鼠...
{\fs12}In all the years we've been tracking coons and possums in these woods...{\r}

44
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:32,223
他連一個都沒撕裂過他們。嗯，沒有...
{\fs12}He ain't never tore one of them up yet. Mm-mmm, no...{\r}

45
00:06:32,343 --> 00:06:35,340
他們被他抓回來時，還是活繃亂跳的
{\fs12}He always brought them back whole and healthy.{\r}

46
00:06:35,867 --> 00:06:36,855
現在你明白了嗎？
{\fs12}Now you see?{\r}

47
00:06:36,975 --> 00:06:41,413
這就是好狗和又兇又髒的獵犬之間的差別...
{\fs12}Now that's the difference between a hound dog that's mean and dirty...{\r}

48
00:06:41,533 --> 00:06:45,315
...像老桑德就是一條很棒的狗
{\fs12}...to one that's great. Like old Sounder here.{\r}

49
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:06,165
我們把一隻困住了，卻被他放走了
{\fs12}We had one cornered, but he got away.{\r}

50
00:07:29,423 --> 00:07:33,300
-你一定累了，小男孩。是吧，大衛李？  -是的，先生。
{\fs12}-I bet you you're tired, little boy. Ain't you, David Lee? -Yes, sir.{\r}

51
00:07:40,642 --> 00:07:42,553
你應該也累了，桑德...
{\fs12}You ought to be tired, too, Sounder...{\r}

52
00:07:42,673 --> 00:07:46,278
...因為浣熊今晚肯定把你操壞了
{\fs12}...cause that coon sure whipped the hell out of you tonight.{\r}

53
00:07:46,398 --> 00:07:49,833
浣熊也打敗了你，爸爸，你還有一枝大獵槍呢
{\fs12}He beat you too, Daddy, and you had a big shootin' rifle.{\r}

54
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:53,665
男孩，不要和你老爸開這種玩笑
{\fs12}You don't make funny with your daddy like that, boy.{\r}

55
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:58,406
-大衛李          -是的，先生？
{\fs12}-David Lee.      -Yes, sir?{\r}

56
00:08:01,208 --> 00:08:04,368
你今晚夠累了，所以，呃...
{\fs12}You had a rough time out there tonight, so, uh...{\r}

57
00:08:04,813 --> 00:08:07,302
明天就別去學校了
{\fs12}...you stay home from that school tomorrow.{\r}

58
00:08:07,422 --> 00:08:08,932
但我想去
{\fs12}But I want to go.{\r}

59
00:08:09,648 --> 00:08:12,932
-你在學校有學到東西嗎？     -有，先生
{\fs12}-Are you learning anything at that school?    -Yes, sir.{\r}

60
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:25,865
夜晚到了這個時刻，月亮跑的像一隻受驚嚇的兔子
{\fs12}When the night comes in these parts, that old moon runs like a scared rabbit.{\r}

61
00:08:27,095 --> 00:08:32,675
你整晚待在這裡，會看不到四周的東西
{\fs12}You can stay here all night just looking and not see a thing out yonder.{\r}

62
00:08:34,063 --> 00:08:36,433
爸爸，我們明天再打獵嗎？
{\fs12}Are we going hunting again tomorrow, Daddy?{\r}

63
00:08:36,553 --> 00:08:37,742
哦耶
{\fs12}Oh, yeah.{\r}

64
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:46,355
你很納悶，是嗎？怎麼運氣那麼背
{\fs12}I guess you wonder why, though, huh? What with the luck we've been having.{\r}

65
00:08:46,475 --> 00:08:48,503
但是，就像我常說的...
{\fs12}But, like I always say...{\r}

66
00:08:48,623 --> 00:08:51,364
“你有些時後會得不到你想追求的...”
{\fs12}"You lose some of the time what you always go after..."{\r}

67
00:08:51,484 --> 00:08:54,003
“...但你不去追求時，什麼都別想得到”
{\fs12}"...but you lose all the time what you don't go after."{\r}

68
00:08:54,123 --> 00:08:57,114
現在，誰說我沒給你做個好榜樣呢，男孩？
{\fs12}Now, who says I didn't put my mark on you, boy?{\r}

69
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,703
大衛李？
{\fs12}David Lee?{\r}

70
00:09:01,098 --> 00:09:03,098
兒子，該去睡覺了
{\fs12}Time to get to bed, son.{\r}

71
00:09:03,218 --> 00:09:04,678
晚安，爸爸
{\fs12}Goodnight, Daddy.{\r}

72
00:09:05,147 --> 00:09:06,629
晚安，兒子
{\fs12}Goodnight, son.{\r}

73
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,151
別吵醒喬西梅和厄爾
{\fs12}Don't wake Josie Mae and Earl, now.{\r}

74
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:21,927
你也該去睡覺了，獵犬。去吧，下去那裡。去！
{\fs12}It's your bedtime too, hound dog. Now go on, get under there. Go on!{\r}

75
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,119
你一定想喝一杯熱咖啡
{\fs12}I bet you could use a hot cup of coffee.{\r}

76
00:09:39,892 --> 00:09:43,053
當然囉，麗貝卡小姐...嗯
{\fs12}I sure could, Miss Rebecca...mmm.{\r}

77
00:09:43,522 --> 00:09:45,497
哦，納森李...
{\fs12}Oh, Nathan Lee...{\r}

78
00:09:50,385 --> 00:09:53,595
該死！那男孩吃光我的核桃
{\fs12}Dammit! That boy done bitten my walnuts.{\r}

79
00:09:53,715 --> 00:09:57,545
我撿了2磅，撿到手指破皮見骨，賣到小貨鋪...幾乎沒有價值...

{\fs12}I skin my fingers to the bone to pick 2 pounds that's worth almost nothing...{\r}

80
00:09:57,665 --> 00:10:00,239
...也得不到幾個錢，他卻吃掉快一半
{\fs12}...at the commissary, and he done took about half of it.{\r}

81
00:10:00,359 --> 00:10:02,462
麗貝卡，男孩餓了嘛
{\fs12}The boy is hungry, Rebecca.{\r}

82
00:10:11,651 --> 00:10:15,059
我們以前經歷過這種艱困時期，納森李 ...
{\fs12}We've been through these hard times before, Nathan Lee...{\r}

83
00:10:15,179 --> 00:10:16,590
...我們撐過來了
{\fs12}...and we made it.{\r}

84
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:19,084
麗貝卡，我們撐過了什麼？
{\fs12}And what did we make it to, Rebecca?{\r}

85
00:10:19,204 --> 00:10:22,206
在另一季給帕金斯老頭繳田租？
{\fs12}Another season sharecropping for old man Perkins?{\r}

86
00:10:22,326 --> 00:10:23,792
努力工作到死...
{\fs12}Working ourselves to death...{\r}

87
00:10:23,912 --> 00:10:28,205
...讓他變得更有錢，收成時我們甚至連吃的都沒有？
{\fs12}...so he can get richer, and we can't even eat when cropping time is done?{\r}

88
00:10:49,363 --> 00:10:50,523
納森...
{\fs12}Nathan...{\r}

89
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,344
{\fs12}Nathan?{\r}

90
00:12:02,668 --> 00:12:03,648
{\fs12}Nathan?{\r}

91
00:12:16,257 --> 00:12:17,289
{\fs12}Nathan?{\r}

92
00:12:20,508 --> 00:12:21,557
{\fs12}Nathan?{\r}

93
00:13:31,494 --> 00:13:35,132
快，你們全部都起床吧！廚房裡煮著肉呢
{\fs12}Come on, y'all, get up! There's meat cooking in the kitchen.{\r}

94
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:37,589
快，起床了！快
{\fs12}Come on, get up! Come on.{\r}

95
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:51,767
-爸爸，裡面有什麼？     -香腸和肉骨
{\fs12}-What's in there, Daddy?   -Sausage and ham bone.{\r}

96
00:13:51,887 --> 00:13:53,141
別那樣做！
{\fs12}Don't do that!{\r}

97
00:13:53,261 --> 00:13:55,295
這從哪裡來的？
{\fs12}Where did it come from?{\r}

98
00:13:56,432 --> 00:13:58,496
 -早安，媽媽     -早安
{\fs12}-Morning, Mama.    -Morning.{\r}

99
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:00,451
爐子上有肉在煮
{\fs12}There's meat cooking on the stove.{\r}

100
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:02,813
沒錯，去洗臉
{\fs12}That's right. Go wash up.{\r}

101
00:14:03,162 --> 00:14:06,243
-哪裡來的？      -有肉的地方
{\fs12}-Where'd it come from?   -Where all meat comes from.{\r}

102
00:14:06,363 --> 00:14:11,196
去洗臉，動作快點。去學校還要走6英里
{\fs12}Now go wash up & be snappy about it. You got 6 miles ahead of you to that school.{\r}

103
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,064
早安，納森
{\fs12}Morning, Nathan.{\r}

104
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:25,569
早安
{\fs12}Morning.{\r}

105
00:14:26,584 --> 00:14:28,508
你吃了嗎？
{\fs12}Did you have any to eat?{\r}

106
00:14:28,628 --> 00:14:32,374
哦，不，讓孩子們先吃。麗貝卡...
{\fs12}Oh, no, I'll wait until after the children. Rebecca...{\r}

107
00:14:32,636 --> 00:14:33,703
什麼事？
{\fs12}Yes?{\r}

108
00:14:36,195 --> 00:14:38,364
外面的天氣怎麼樣？
{\fs12}What's the weather like out there?{\r}

109
00:14:39,501 --> 00:14:40,673
很熱
{\fs12}It's hot.{\r}

110
00:14:41,426 --> 00:14:45,012
那麼，是我們今天棒球比賽的好天氣囉？
{\fs12}Gonna be good baseball weather for our game today, then, huh?{\r}

111
00:14:45,132 --> 00:14:46,122
嗯-嗯
{\fs12}Mm-hmm.{\r}

112
00:14:48,946 --> 00:14:49,935
早安，爸爸
{\fs12}Morning, Daddy.{\r}

113
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,920
你也早安！
{\fs12}Well...morning back at you!{\r}

114
00:14:52,414 --> 00:14:55,253
嘿，你給我留下了一些，是嗎？
{\fs12}Hey, now, you save some of that for me, huh?{\r}

115
00:14:56,017 --> 00:14:57,054
桑德？
{\fs12}Sounder?{\r}

116
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,227
嘿，桑德！來吧

-打敗他們！       -就這次！
{\fs12}-Let's get him! -One time!{\r}

184
00:21:07,626 --> 00:21:09,117
他不過只是個菜鳥
{\fs12}He ain't nothing but a rookie.{\r}

185
00:21:09,237 --> 00:21:10,305
嘿，出局！
{\fs12}Hey, out!{\r}

186
00:21:11,984 --> 00:21:13,559
還有一個，爸爸！
{\fs12}One more to go, Daddy!{\r}

187

{\fs12}-One time. -He ain't nothing but a rookie.{\r}

191
00:21:49,043 --> 00:21:53,783
速球，速球，拜託你不要把球傳給我...*
{\fs12}Speedball, Speedball, won't you please pitch that ball to me...{\r}

192
00:21:53,903 --> 00:21:57,546
他今天已經為你準備了這個球。是他做的！*
{\fs12}He already pitched that ball for you today. Yes he did!{\r}

193
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:03,518
速球，速球，請你不要把球傳給我...*
{\fs12}Speedball, Speedball, won't you please pitch that ball to me...{\r}

194
00:22:06,517 --> 00:22:11,932
-別的隊得2分，而速球的球隊得3分！ -3分！
{\fs12}-Well, the other team got 2 and Speedball's team got 3! -Got 3!{\r}

195
00:22:12,739 --> 00:22:15,430
你來告訴他們，艾克！確實是的
{\fs12}You tell them, Ike! Yes, indeed.{\r}

196
00:22:15,927 --> 00:22:20,322
速球，速球，棒球真的是你的菜...
{\fs12}Speedball, Speedball, I do believe baseball is your game...{\r}

197
00:22:20,442 --> 00:22:24,050
是他的菜沒錯！今天就是證明，不是嗎？
{\fs12}It's his game alright! He proved that one today, didn't he?{\r}

198
00:22:24,170 --> 00:22:28,992
速球，速球，棒球真的是你的菜...
{\fs12}Speedball, Speedball, I do believe baseball is your game...{\r}

199
00:22:29,112 --> 00:22:31,563
是他的菜！不是他的恥辱，而是他的菜！
{\fs12}It's his game! Not his shame, but his game!{\r}

200
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:37,331
哦，你是入夥了*，就是你納森李.摩根
{\fs12}Oh, you're a regular partner, Nathan Lee Morgan is your name.{\r}

201
00:22:37,451 --> 00:22:40,664
納森李.摩根！那是他的名字
{\fs12}Nathan Lee Morgan! That's his name.{\r}

202
00:22:40,784 --> 00:22:45,726
哦，你是入夥了*，就是你納森李.摩根
{\fs12}Oh, you're a regular partner, Nathan Lee Morgan is your name.{\r}

203
00:22:45,846 --> 00:22:47,852
納森李.摩根！
{\fs12}Nathan Lee Morgan!{\r}

204
00:22:51,748 --> 00:22:54,279
老兄，如果他們聽到我在北方玩這個，你知道...
{\fs12}Look here, man, if they heard me play like this up north, you know...{\r}

205
00:22:54,399 --> 00:22:56,560
...我就會比我的地主更富有！
{\fs12}...I'd be richer than the man I sharecrop for!{\r}

206
00:22:56,680 --> 00:22:57,794
啊對！
{\fs12}Oh, right!{\r}

207
00:22:57,914 --> 00:22:59,651
如果他們看到我投球的樣子...
{\fs12}And if they saw me pitch the way I did...{\r}

208
00:22:59,771 --> 00:23:01,901
...他們僱用我只是為了三振貝比·魯斯！
{\fs12}...they'd hire me just to strike out Babe Ruth!{\r}

209
00:23:04,759 --> 00:23:08,290
你知道，那肯定能振奮人心的，主啊！
{\fs12}Well, you know, that sure is a-thrilling, yes Lord!{\r}

210
00:23:08,410 --> 00:23:10,540
他們在白人教堂都做些什麼，媽媽？
{\fs12}What they do in them white churches, Mama?{\r}

211
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,962
就跟你一樣：他們禱告
{\fs12}Same as you do: they pray.{\r}

212
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:14,618
才不...
{\fs12}Naw...{\r}

213
00:23:15,005 --> 00:23:20,130
有一次我不小心跑進拉伊教區的白人教堂，你知道嗎？
{\fs12}One time by mistake I went to this white church down there in Rye Parish, y'know?{\r}

214
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:24,270
直到今天，我還搞不清楚是怎麼活著離開的
{\fs12}And to this very day I don't know how I ever got out of there alive.{\r}

215
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:28,879
-也許他們認為你瘋了    -哦老天，應該是的，應該是的
{\fs12}-Well, they probably thought you was crazy. -Oh man, I guess so, I guess so.{\r}

216
00:23:29,419 --> 00:23:32,654
但我回家了。你了解我：我常向天主禱告...
{\fs12}But I went home. You know me: I did me some praying to the good Lord...{\r}

217
00:23:32,774 --> 00:23:33,919
是的，我們了解你...
{\fs12}Yeah, we know you...{\r}

218
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:39,206
我去拉伊教區的白人教堂的事，我問過天主...
{\fs12}I asked the good Lord about this white church that I went to in Rye Parish...{\r}

219
00:23:39,326 --> 00:23:43,342
...我說，我只想知道到底是怎麼活著離開的
{\fs12}...and I said, all I wanna know is how the devil I ever got out of there alive.{\r}

220
00:23:43,462 --> 00:23:45,529
天主對你說了什麼，艾克？
{\fs12}And what did the good Lord say to you, Ike?{\r}

221
00:23:45,649 --> 00:23:49,430
天主說：“艾克，你知道，你做得比我好”
{\fs12}Well, the good Lord said, "Ike, you know, you're doing better than Me."{\r}

222
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:53,337
“因為我一直試著想進去，200年了都還沒成功”
{\fs12}"'Cause I been trying to get in there for 200 years and I ain't make it yet."{\r}

223
00:23:56,115 --> 00:24:00,521
哦，艾克，如果這個教區裡有魔鬼，那就是你了
{\fs12}Oh, Ike, if ever there was a devil in this parish, you's it.{\r}

224
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:04,740
根據這個你能做出一首歌嗎，艾克？
{\fs12}You could make a song out of that, couldn't you, Ike?{\r}

225
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:07,323
我一定要做，速球
{\fs12}I believe I'll just do that, Speedball.{\r}

{\fs12}-Bye, y'all. -Bye. Bye.{\r}

227
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:17,901
去鄉下，媽媽不想去嗎？
{\fs12}Going to the country, Mama don't you want to go?{\r}

228
00:24:21,199 --> 00:24:25,246
去鄉下，媽媽不想去嗎？
{\fs12}Going to the country, Mama don't you want to go?{\r}

納森，看起來應該是個溫暖的夜晚
{\fs12}Looks like it's going to be a nice warm night coming up, Nathan.{\r}

236
00:24:53,111 --> 00:24:55,413
-你要去樹林？       -哦耶
{\fs12}-You going in them woods? -Oh, yeah.{\r}

237
00:24:55,533 --> 00:24:58,255
今晚的浣熊和負鼠躲我們遠一點
{\fs12}Them coons and possums better hide deep from us tonight.{\r}

{\fs12}-Mm-hmm! -Critters in the woods better hide tonight, oh Lord, hide tonight...{\r}

239
00:25:03,924 --> 00:25:08,788
今晚躲好哦，主啊，今晚躲起來，今晚躲起來！
{\fs12}Hide tonight, oh Lord, hide tonight, hide tonight!{\r}

240
00:25:09,038 --> 00:25:12,429
哦，主啊，今晚躲起來，今晚躲起來！

 -今晚樹林裡的小動物們最好躲起來，主啊...
{\fs12}-Critters in the woods better hide tonight, oh Lord...{\r}

242
00:25:15,311 --> 00:25:18,768
...打擊強勁，穿過艾克的雙腿，他彎下腰去接球...
{\fs12}...hit it so hard it went through Ike's legs and he bent down to get the ball...{\r}

243
00:25:18,888 --> 00:25:21,763
...全部的塵土都沾上他的臉了，哈哈哈！
{\fs12}...and all the dirt went into his face, hahaha!{\r}

244
00:25:22,188 --> 00:25:25,680
我告訴你，納森李，那個時候你確實打中那球，我必須說...
{\fs12}I tell you, Nathan Lee, you really did hit that ball that time, I must say...{\r}

245
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:30,472
不是嗎，喬西梅？ 
{\fs12}Didn't he, Josie Mae? [The rest is unintelligible.]{\r}

246
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:33,681

{\fs12}Oh Lord, I thought I would die...{\r}

247
00:25:33,801 --> 00:25:36,281
他要去哪裡？你要去哪裡...
{\fs12}Where's he going? Where you off to...{\r}

248
00:25:46,765 --> 00:25:49,941
爸爸，房子前面有兩個男人，那是誰？
{\fs12}Daddy, there's two men in front of the house. Who is that?{\r}

249
00:25:50,061 --> 00:25:51,066
納森...
{\fs12}Nathan...{\r}

250
00:25:55,298 --> 00:25:56,744
噓，桑德
{\fs12}Hush up, Sounder.{\r}

{\fs12}-We've been in your house, Nathan. -Hold that dog.{\r}

{\fs12}We found what we was looking for, too.{\r}

254
00:26:24,407 --> 00:26:27,884
你昨晚在傑米的燻製室 拿走一些食物
{\fs12}Now you took some food and stuff from Jamie's smokehouse last night.{\r}

255
00:26:28,306 --> 00:26:30,959
我的副警長和我，必須帶你去郡政府
{\fs12}My deputy and me, we've got to take you down to the county house.{\r}

256
00:26:31,079 --> 00:26:34,115
-他們在做什麼，媽媽？    -安靜，兒子，安靜！
{\fs12}-What they doing, Mama?    -Quiet, son, quiet!{\r}

257
00:26:38,135 --> 00:26:39,763
帶他進卡車
{\fs12}Get him in the truck.{\r}

258
00:26:40,949 --> 00:26:42,497
楊警長？
{\fs12}Sheriff Young?{\r}

259
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:47,044
你認識納森很久了，你知道他的為人
{\fs12}You've been knowing Nathan for a long time. You know the kind of man he is.{\r}

260
00:26:47,164 --> 00:26:50,703
你也知道我們在艱困時期所遇到的麻煩...
{\fs12}And you know the troubles we've been having in these hard times...{\r}

261
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,588

00:28:15,011 --> 00:28:16,559
{\fs12}Sounder!{\r}

00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:22,878
{\fs12}Sounder!{\r}

現在由大衛李當家，你和厄爾要聽他的話，聽到了嗎？
{\fs12}David Lee is in charge now, and you and Earl do just like he tells you, hear?{\r}

274
00:28:49,486 --> 00:28:53,284

{\fs12}And fix some of that corn mush for y'all to eat.{\r}

276
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:58,558
要找桑德，別跑得太遠
{\fs12}Don't go too far now looking for Sounder.{\r}

277
00:28:58,678 --> 00:29:02,598
有陌生人問你問題，什麼都別說，聽到嗎？
{\fs12}Anybody comes that's a stranger asking you questions, don't say nothing, hear?{\r}

278
00:29:02,718 --> 00:29:03,974
我不會
{\fs12}I won't.{\r}

279

-再見，兒子       -再見，媽媽

-再見，媽媽     -再見，媽媽
{\fs12}-Bye, Mama.     -Bye, Mama.{\r}

282
00:31:28,704 --> 00:31:29,951
你好嗎？
{\fs12}How do you do?{\r}

283
00:31:30,393 --> 00:31:32,282
麗貝卡，早安
{\fs12}Good morning, Rebecca.{\r}

284
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:35,378
今天早上我在等你來
{\fs12}I was sort of expecting you this morning.{\r}

285
00:31:35,692 --> 00:31:37,662
我來看看納森
{\fs12}I've come to see Nathan.{\r}

286
00:31:38,044 --> 00:31:39,250
呃...
{\fs12}Well...{\r}

287
00:31:39,370 --> 00:31:41,682
我很想，但我不能
{\fs12}I wish I could, but I can't let you.{\r}

288
00:31:43,531 --> 00:31:45,840
我不明白，楊警長
{\fs12}I don't understand that, Sheriff Young.{\r}

289
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,448
這很簡單
{\fs12}Well, it's simple.{\r}

290
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:50,382
這是規定
{\fs12}That's the rules.{\r}

291
00:31:50,502 --> 00:31:51,804
我只能遵守
{\fs12}I follow them.{\r}

292
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:54,678
除了周日和節假日外，不准會客
{\fs12}Ain't no visiting, except Sunday and holidays.{\r}

293
00:31:54,798 --> 00:31:56,266
婦女同胞則一律禁見
{\fs12}No womenfolk no time.{\r}

294
00:31:56,386 --> 00:31:59,182
你是在告訴我，我不能見自己的丈夫？
{\fs12}You mean to tell me, I can't see my own husband?{\r}

295
00:31:59,302 --> 00:32:02,691
在蘭斯敦 是這樣規定的...
{\fs12}Well, that's the way they do things here in Lansdowne...{\r}

296
00:32:03,133 --> 00:32:04,862
我只是奉命行事
{\fs12}I just follow orders.{\r}

297
00:32:08,608 --> 00:32:12,809
但是...我得見他，警長先生，我必須看到納森
{\fs12}But...I've got to see him, Mr. Sheriff, you know, I've got to see Nathan.{\r}

298
00:32:13,653 --> 00:32:15,882
我想幫你...
{\fs12}Well, I'd like to help you...{\r}

299
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:19,556
...除了讓我們兩為難，並無濟於事
{\fs12}...but that wouldn't do anything but get us both in trouble.{\r}

300
00:32:24,579 --> 00:32:26,468
他們會給他一個審判？
{\fs12}They gonna give him a trial?{\r}

301
00:32:26,588 --> 00:32:28,659
可能在下週某些時候
{\fs12}Probably some time next week.{\r}

302
00:32:29,463 --> 00:32:31,284
我要告訴你 我會怎麼做...
{\fs12}I'll tell you what I'll do...{\r}

303
00:32:31,404 --> 00:32:36,479
只要我知道是哪一天，我就會開車去你家通知你
{\fs12}Soon as I find out what day, I'll drive on out to your place and let you know.{\r}

304
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:46,342
麗貝卡
{\fs12}Rebecca.{\r}

305
00:32:53,788 --> 00:32:56,501
警長先生，你找到了一份低賤的工作
{\fs12}You've got you a low-life job, Mr. Sheriff.{\r}

306
00:33:32,355 --> 00:33:34,526
麗貝卡，我正想找你
{\fs12}Rebecca, you're just the one I want to see.{\r}

307
00:33:34,646 --> 00:33:37,260
我帶這些核桃來交易
{\fs12}I brought these walnuts to trade.{\r}

308
00:33:42,658 --> 00:33:44,487
這是1元2美分
{\fs12}That's 1 dollar and 20 cents.{\r}

309
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:47,181
-我想拿我要的東西   -希望不是太多，因為...
{\fs12}-I want to get me some things.   -I hope it ain't a lot, because...{\r}

310
00:33:47,301 --> 00:33:49,914
...在耕作時期之前，不能再讓你賒帳了
{\fs12}...I can't give you no more credit until cropping season gets back.{\r}

311
00:33:50,034 --> 00:33:51,690
也就是說，如果納森趕得上的話
{\fs12}That is, if Nathan makes it.{\r}

312
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:54,705
帕金斯先生，我沒說要賒帳
{\fs12}I didn't say nothing about no credit, Mr. Perkins.{\r}

313
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:57,780
-你想訂購什麼？   -我需要一些麵粉...
{\fs12}-What you want to order?   -I need me some flour...{\r}

314
00:33:59,628 --> 00:34:01,096
肉荳蔻...
{\fs12}Nutmeg...{\r}

315
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,794
巧克力...
{\fs12}Chocolate...{\r}

316
00:34:06,101 --> 00:34:07,895
[香草精] ...
{\fs12}Extract [of vanilla]...{\r}

317
00:34:08,015 --> 00:34:09,765
哦，還有一些糖...
{\fs12}Oh, and some sugar...{\r}

318
00:34:12,378 --> 00:34:14,047
並給我2個雞蛋
{\fs12}And give me 2 eggs.{\r}

319
00:34:14,911 --> 00:34:18,006
現在，我想和你談的是納森
{\fs12}Now what I want to talk to you about is Nathan.{\r}

320
00:34:18,126 --> 00:34:20,324
他不該做那件事
{\fs12}He oughtn't have done what he did.{\r}

321
00:34:20,968 --> 00:34:24,365
潛入傑米的地方，並拿走人家的貨物
{\fs12}Sneaking into Jamie's place and taking their goods.{\r}

322
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:27,171
這對我來說很糟糕
{\fs12}That looks bad on me.{\r}

323
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,322
我對你們都很好
{\fs12}I been good to y'all.{\r}

324
00:34:29,442 --> 00:34:32,160
我不是費盡苦心去說服蘭斯敦的人...
{\fs12}Didn't I go to all that trouble to get the people of Lansdowne...{\r}

325
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,017
...讓你的大衛李去唸他們的學校？不是嗎？
{\fs12}...to let your David Lee go to their school? Didn't I?{\r}

326
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:40,169
另一件事：
{\fs12}And another thing:{\r}

327
00:34:40,289 --> 00:34:42,742
納森進了監獄...
{\fs12}With Nathan in jail and all...{\r}

328
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:47,758
...當春季到來時，你打算怎麼替我種地啊？
{\fs12}...how are you going to crop for me when the spring season comes? Huh?{\r}

329
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:51,638
該死的，我在和你說話，女人！
{\fs12}Dammit, I'm talking to you, woman!{\r}

330
00:34:52,248 --> 00:34:55,746
我有一個農場要擔心，我需要一些回答
{\fs12}I've got a farm to worry about, and I need some answers.{\r}

331
00:34:57,816 --> 00:35:00,912
帕金斯先生，耕作季節還要很久才到
{\fs12}Cropping season is a long way off, Mr. Perkins.{\r}

332
00:35:01,032 --> 00:35:03,791
到那時，納森應該回家了
{\fs12}By that time, Nathan ought to be home.{\r}

333
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:04,977
如果他不能...
{\fs12}If he ain't...{\r}

334
00:35:05,097 --> 00:35:07,791
...相信我，孩子和我會耕作
{\fs12}...believe me, the children and me will do the cropping.{\r}

335
00:35:07,911 --> 00:35:09,573
我們一定要的話
{\fs12}If we have too.{\r}

336
00:35:09,693 --> 00:35:12,367
因為我們還欠你錢
{\fs12}Because we owe you all that money.{\r}

337
00:35:12,769 --> 00:35:14,196
帕金斯先生
{\fs12}Mr. Perkins.{\r}

338
00:35:17,452 --> 00:35:19,422
你認為桑德死了嗎，大衛李？
{\fs12}Do you think Sounder's dead, David Lee?{\r}

339
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,568
他會死嗎？
{\fs12}Will he stay dead?{\r}

340
00:35:20,688 --> 00:35:23,277
他沒死。別再問莫名其妙的問題
{\fs12}He ain't dead. Now stop asking crazy questions.{\r}

341
00:35:23,397 --> 00:35:25,811
你沒找到我們的死狗 也別生氣啊
{\fs12}You don't have to get mad because you didn't find our dead dog.{\r}

342
00:35:25,931 --> 00:35:27,243
他沒死！
{\fs12}He's not dead!{\r}

343
00:35:27,363 --> 00:35:28,328
大衛李？
{\fs12}David Lee?{\r}

344
00:35:28,448 --> 00:35:30,619
媽媽！媽媽，媽媽！
{\fs12}Mama! Mama, Mama!{\r}

345
00:35:30,739 --> 00:35:32,271
媽媽，媽媽！
{\fs12}Mama, Mama!{\r}

346
00:35:32,391 --> 00:35:33,557
主啊，好熱
{\fs12}Lord, it's hot.{\r}

347
00:35:33,677 --> 00:35:36,230
-有我的東西嗎？   -你們過得怎樣？
{\fs12}-Anything for me?   -How have y'all been?{\r}

348
00:35:36,350 --> 00:35:37,738
有人來過這裡嗎？
{\fs12}Anybody been here?{\r}

349
00:35:37,858 --> 00:35:40,800
-沒有，你看到爸了？    -沒有，兒子
{\fs12}-No, ma'am. You see Daddy? -No, son.{\r}

350
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,601
他必須等到假日到來
{\fs12}He'll have to wait until the holiday comes.{\r}

351
00:35:43,721 --> 00:35:47,279
無論如何，不准女人去探視自己的男人！
{\fs12}Anyway, won't let womenfolk see their men no time!{\r}

352
00:35:47,974 --> 00:35:51,934
-假日時我能去見他嗎？   -你肯定可以，兒子
{\fs12}-Can I see him when the holiday comes? -You sure can, son.{\r}

353
00:35:52,534 --> 00:35:54,322
有桑德的消息？
{\fs12}Any sign of Sounder?{\r}

354
00:35:54,442 --> 00:35:55,865
沒有，媽
{\fs12}No, ma'am.{\r}

355
00:35:55,985 --> 00:35:58,116
這些地方我都找遍了
{\fs12}I looked all over these parts.{\r}

356
00:35:58,236 --> 00:36:01,915
我想那一槍也許打中頭了
{\fs12}Well, I think maybe he was whipped on the head by that shot.{\r}

357
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:03,865
我不認為他已經死了
{\fs12}I don't think he's dead.{\r}

358
00:36:03,985 --> 00:36:06,103
只是去某個地方 療養自己的傷
{\fs12}Just gone off to heal himself somewhere.{\r}

359
00:36:06,223 --> 00:36:07,633
這裡什麼都沒有
{\fs12}Nothing in here.{\r}

360
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:10,741
沒有...
{\fs12}No...{\r}

361
00:36:10,861 --> 00:36:15,183
我正在做蛋糕，讓大衛李帶去給你爸爸
{\fs12}I'm fixing to bake a cake for David Lee to take to your daddy this time.{\r}

362
00:36:15,826 --> 00:36:17,803
做一個巧克力蛋糕，媽媽
{\fs12}Make a chocolate cake, Mama.{\r}

363
00:36:18,989 --> 00:36:21,743

{\fs12}Daddy likes things that's chocolate.{\r}

364
00:36:25,092 --> 00:36:28,248
被告請起立，前進到法官席
{\fs12}Defendant will rise and come before the bench.{\r}

365
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:41,516
納森李.摩根...
{\fs12}Nathan Lee Morgan...{\r}

366
00:36:41,636 --> 00:36:45,746
...你非法入侵，被判有罪...

...還有搶劫
{\fs12}...and robbery.{\r}

368
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:51,402
在法院宣判你的刑責之前，有什麼想對法庭說的嗎？
{\fs12}Is there anything you wish to say to the court, prior to...{\r}

369
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:54,368
在法院宣判你的刑責之前，有什麼想對法庭說的嗎？
{\fs12}...the court pronouncing sentence upon you?{\r}

370
00:36:56,779 --> 00:36:57,884
沒有，先生
{\fs12}No, sir.{\r}

371
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:02,701
本院判決，立即將你交付給本教區的警長收押...

372
00:37:02,711 --> 00:37:04,667

準備進行下一個案件
{\fs12}Collect and call the next case.{\r}

376
00:38:33,209 --> 00:38:34,757
桑德！

377
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:39,189

大衛李...
{\fs12}David Lee...{\r}

383
00:39:27,386 --> 00:39:30,871
一定要讓爸爸告訴你，他們要把他送到哪個營地
{\fs12}Be sure to ask your daddy to tell you what camp they're going to send him to.{\r}

384
00:39:30,991 --> 00:39:33,665
你現在看起來有點餓，所以一點也沒替他悲傷
{\fs12}Look perk-ish now, so you don't grieve him none.{\r}

385
00:39:33,785 --> 00:39:35,448
好吧，就這樣，兒子
{\fs12}OK, that's all, son.{\r}

386
00:39:36,255 --> 00:39:38,446
別忘記我告訴你的事，去吧！
{\fs12}Don't forget what I told you, now!{\r}

387
00:40:06,886 --> 00:40:08,937

給我爸的蛋糕
{\fs12}A cake for my daddy.{\r}

389
00:40:10,483 --> 00:40:13,961
放在這張桌子上，讓我先檢查
{\fs12}Well, put it on this table, and wait until I check it.{\r}

390
00:40:14,605 --> 00:40:16,764
男孩，再小心也不為過
{\fs12}Can't be too careful, boy.{\r}

391
00:40:16,884 --> 00:40:19,840
可能有銼刀或鋸子在裡面
{\fs12}There just might be a steel file or a hacksaw in it.{\r}

392
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:30,856
你爸叫什麼名字？

00:41:11,423 --> 00:41:12,830
嗨，爸爸
{\fs12}Hi, Daddy.{\r}

398
00:41:13,152 --> 00:41:14,652
嗨
{\fs12}Hi back at you.{\r}

399
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:18,557
媽媽和喬西梅和厄爾在外面
{\fs12}Mama's outside with Josie Mae and Earl.{\r}

呃...
{\fs12}Well...{\r}

00:41:29,395 --> 00:41:31,847
兒子，見到你好高興
{\fs12}It sure is good to see you, son.{\r}

403
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:36,792
原本是個好蛋糕，被外面那個人戳的全是洞
{\fs12}This was a real cake, before the man outside put all these holes in it.{\r}

404
00:41:37,766 --> 00:41:40,721
哦，現在這沒多大差別
{\fs12}Oh, now, that don't make no difference.{\r}

405
00:41:42,510 --> 00:41:44,158
以我對你媽的認知...
{\fs12}If I know your mama...{\r}

406
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:49,358
...一些刀孔不會破壞她在這塊蛋糕所下努心
{\fs12}...a few knife holes ain't gonna destroy the soul that she done put in this cake.{\r}

407
00:41:49,478 --> 00:41:52,473
給你，跟爸爸一起吃
{\fs12}Here. Now have a piece with your daddy.{\r}

408
00:41:57,666 --> 00:41:58,704
嗯...

00:41:59,958 --> 00:42:00,923
嗯
{\fs12}Mmm.{\r}

410
00:42:05,164 --> 00:42:06,222
爸爸...
{\fs12}Daddy...{\r}

411
00:42:06,342 --> 00:42:08,827
我們還沒有找到桑德
{\fs12}We didn't find Sounder yet.{\r}

412
00:42:08,947 --> 00:42:10,837
他有一天會露面
{\fs12}Well, he'll show up one day.{\r}

413
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:17,477
他死了嗎，爸爸？
{\fs12}Think he's dead, Daddy?{\r}

414
00:42:18,321 --> 00:42:19,849
不，兒子
{\fs12}No, son.{\r}

415
00:42:20,191 --> 00:42:24,331
他的傷口一癒合就會立刻回你身邊，你等著看
{\fs12}He'll come back to you just as soon as his wounds heal. Now, you'll see.{\r}

416
00:42:24,451 --> 00:42:26,170
主啊...
{\fs12}Lord...{\r}

417
00:42:26,290 --> 00:42:28,320
...這個蛋糕真好吃
{\fs12}...this cake sure is tasty.{\r}

418
00:42:39,483 --> 00:42:42,458
很遺憾他們不會讓他們進來
{\fs12}It's a shame they won't let them come in here.{\r}

419
00:42:44,271 --> 00:42:48,834
如果我有力量，我會打倒這該死的牆壁，就可以...
{\fs12}Boy, if I had the strength, I'd knock down these damn walls just so I could...{\r}

420
00:42:48,954 --> 00:42:51,735
...去摟著你媽媽，只是...
{\fs12}...get my arms around your mama, just...{\r}

421
00:42:52,941 --> 00:42:55,193
你覺得他們會在我們這一邊嗎？
{\fs12}Are they on this side of us, do you think?{\r}

422
00:42:55,313 --> 00:42:56,761
應該是
{\fs12}I think so.{\r}

423
00:42:56,881 --> 00:43:00,930
就算我打爛了雙臂，我要親自去證實看看！
{\fs12}I'm going to see about that, if I have to break both of my arms!{\r}

424
00:43:13,653 --> 00:43:14,778
兒子...
{\fs12}Son...{\r}

425
00:43:14,898 --> 00:43:18,276
...永遠別讓自己陷入這樣的境地！
{\fs12}...don't ever let yourself get caught in a place like this!{\r}

426
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:22,143
爸爸...
{\fs12}Daddy...{\r}

427
00:43:22,263 --> 00:43:25,811
...你知道他們要送你到哪個營地嗎？
{\fs12}...can you say what camp they're going to send you to?{\r}

428
00:43:25,931 --> 00:43:28,866
不，他們不會告訴我們這些事
{\fs12}No, they don't tell us things like that.{\r}

429
00:43:29,449 --> 00:43:32,384
但是我不想讓你們再來這裡
{\fs12}But I don't want y'all to come here no more.{\r}

430
00:43:32,504 --> 00:43:34,562
為什麼，爸爸？你不會在這兒？
{\fs12}Why, Daddy? You won't be here?{\r}

431
00:43:37,015 --> 00:43:38,984
照我的話去做
{\fs12}Do like I tell you.{\r}

432
00:43:41,678 --> 00:43:43,045
時間到了
{\fs12}Time's up.{\r}

433
00:43:43,165 --> 00:43:44,653
來吧，男孩
{\fs12}Come on, boy.{\r}

434
00:43:56,972 --> 00:43:58,158
兒子...
{\fs12}Son...{\r}

435
00:44:07,412 --> 00:44:11,010
哦，我寧願在小溪釣鯛魚...
{\fs12}Oh, I'd rather be fishing for bream in the creek...{\r}

436
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:14,267
...而不願整個星期在太陽底下工作
{\fs12}...than working in the sun out here all week.{\r}

437
00:44:14,387 --> 00:44:20,350
我想要一個妞，嘿天主，我想要一個妞，嘿，我得到了
{\fs12}I expect a gal, hey Lord, I expects a gal, hey I got to{\r}

438
00:44:20,470 --> 00:44:26,387
繼續工作，繼續拉，繼續在炎熱的太陽下拖...
{\fs12}Keep on working, keep on pulling, keep on hauling in the hot sun...{\r}

439
00:44:26,683 --> 00:44:28,593
主啊...
{\fs12}Lord...{\r}

440
00:44:29,598 --> 00:44:32,532
主啊，孩子...
{\fs12}Lord, children...{\r}

441
00:44:32,652 --> 00:44:34,540
主啊...
{\fs12}Lord...{\r}

442
00:44:35,586 --> 00:44:38,018
主啊，孩子...
{\fs12}Lord, child...{\r}

443
00:44:38,138 --> 00:44:43,970
如果我希望能夠超越我的生活方式，就必須推動並拉動和交易。***
{\fs12}If I expect to get outta the way I live, got to push and pull and deal and give.{\r}

444
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:50,153
如果我希望有一段時間改變我的方式，我就會做我現在正在做的事情...
{\fs12}If I expect to change my ways some time, I got to do what I'm doing now...{\r}

445
00:44:50,273 --> 00:44:56,264
...我必須做我現在正在做的事情。我必須做我正在做的事情。
{\fs12}...I got to do what I'm doing now. I got to do what I'm doing.{\r}

446
00:44:56,384 --> 00:44:58,842
我的天...
{\fs12}Oh, Lord...{\r}

447
00:44:59,325 --> 00:45:01,576
我的天...
{\fs12}Oh, Lord...{\r}

448
00:45:02,219 --> 00:45:07,566
總有一天會有變化，主啊，總有一天會有變化。
{\fs12}Someday there'll be a change, Lord, someday there'll be a change.{\r}

449
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:11,373
“是的，”D'Artagnan說，“但我們會...”
{\fs12}"Yes," said D'Artagnan, "but we shall..."{\r}

450
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:14,187
“...不可避免地...被槍殺了。”

{\fs12}"But you know very well that the bullets most to be feared..."{\r}

453
00:45:20,850 --> 00:45:23,061

454
00:45:23,181 --> 00:45:27,048

“...遠征...我們至少應該帶上我們的火槍。”
{\fs12}"...expedition...we should have at least brought our muskets."{\r}

456
00:45:33,815 --> 00:45:37,071
“你是一個傻瓜，朋友Porthos。我們為什麼要...
{\fs12}"You are a simpleton, friend Porthos. Why should we...{\r}

457
00:45:37,191 --> 00:45:43,101
給我這個過時的宗教信仰...

{\fs12}Give me this old time religion...{\r}

459
00:45:50,244 --> 00:45:56,148
給我那個過時的宗教信仰...
{\fs12}Give me that old time religion...{\r}

460
00:45:57,268 --> 00:46:03,239
主啊，這對我來說已經足夠了。
{\fs12}Lord, it's good enough for me.{\r}

461
00:46:04,022 --> 00:46:09,991
是的，它在死亡時很好...
{\fs12}Yes, it's good in the time of dying...{\r}

462
00:46:10,311 --> 00:46:16,239
是的，它在死亡時很好...
{\fs12}Yes, it's good in the time of dying...{\r}

463
00:46:17,041 --> 00:46:22,790
是的，它在死亡時很好...
{\fs12}Yes, it's good in the time of dying...{\r}

464
00:46:22,910 --> 00:46:28,886
主啊，這對我來說已經足夠了。
{\fs12}Lord, it's good enough for me.{\r}

465
00:46:32,404 --> 00:46:34,731
主啊，如果這不是星期天，我相信...
{\fs12}Lord, if this wasn't a Sunday, I do believe...{\r}

466
00:46:34,851 --> 00:46:37,123
...我會為艾克正在演奏的音樂跳舞。
{\fs12}...I'd do a dance to that music Ike's playing.{\r}

467
00:46:37,243 --> 00:46:40,003
哦，繼續，哈里特，然後搖晃他們的腳。上帝不看！
{\fs12}Oh, go on, Harriet, and shake them feet. God ain't looking!{\r}

468
00:46:40,123 --> 00:46:42,907
現在，我可能是一個鄉村女人，但我不是傻瓜！
{\fs12}Now, I might be a country woman, but I ain't no fool!{\r}

469
00:46:43,027 --> 00:46:46,565
 -來吧，哈麗特女士。 -來吧，哈麗特女士。 -來吧，哈麗特女士。
{\fs12}-Come on, Ms. Harriet. -Come on, Ms. Harriet. -Come on, Ms. Harriet.{\r}

470
00:46:46,685 --> 00:46:49,178
好吧，你不能責怪一個女孩的嘗試！
{\fs12}Well, you can't blame a girl for trying!{\r}

471
00:47:02,831 --> 00:47:04,398
好日子，牧師。
{\fs12}Good day, Reverend.{\r}

472
00:47:04,981 --> 00:47:06,589
麗貝卡...
{\fs12}Rebecca...{\r}

473
00:47:06,971 --> 00:47:09,363
大衛李，給了牧師一個席位。
{\fs12}David Lee, give the reverend a seat.{\r}

474
00:47:13,732 --> 00:47:14,858
納森的話？
{\fs12}Word from Nathan?{\r}

475
00:47:14,978 --> 00:47:19,018
不，我沒有任何東西，麗貝卡。我去了法院...
{\fs12}No, I haven't got anything, Rebecca. I went down to the courthouse...{\r}

476
00:47:19,138 --> 00:47:23,250
...昨天，看看它，他們不會告訴我什麼...
{\fs12}...yesterday, to see about it, and they wouldn't tell me nothing...{\r}

477
00:47:23,370 --> 00:47:26,747
...至於納森被派去的勞改營。
{\fs12}...as to what labor camp Nathan was sent to.{\r}

478
00:47:27,933 --> 00:47:29,481
對不起
{\fs12}And I'm sorry.{\r}

479
00:47:31,712 --> 00:47:33,782
這是一個該死的恥辱，牧師。
{\fs12}It's a damn shame, Reverend.{\r}

480
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:36,434
真是太遺憾了。
{\fs12}It's a damn shame.{\r}

481
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:41,138
摩根修女，讓我們不要痛苦。
{\fs12}Let us not take to bitterness, Sister Morgan.{\r}

482
00:47:42,143 --> 00:47:47,605
為什麼，在同一個教會裡，我們遇到了同樣麻煩的女性。
{\fs12}Why, in this same church, we have women with the same trouble you are having.{\r}

483
00:47:49,226 --> 00:47:50,854
我告訴他們的是什麼...
{\fs12}What I tell them...{\r}

484
00:47:51,926 --> 00:47:57,695
...無論苦難...還是試煉...把它帶到上帝面前。
{\fs12}...whatever misery...or trials...take it to God.{\r}

485
00:48:00,562 --> 00:48:02,271
“把它帶到上帝面前。”
{\fs12}"Take it to God."{\r}

486
00:48:02,592 --> 00:48:04,824
麗貝卡，這並不是那麼簡單。
{\fs12}It's not that simple, Rebecca.{\r}

487
00:48:05,306 --> 00:48:07,557
上帝以神秘的方式工作。
{\fs12}God works in a mysterious way.{\r}

488
00:48:08,904 --> 00:48:11,195
我們沒有帶來任何生命...
{\fs12}We brought nothing into this life...{\r}

489
00:48:12,172 --> 00:48:14,162
...我們什麼都沒帶。
{\fs12}...and we carry nothing out.{\r}

490
00:48:14,282 --> 00:48:16,353
這是一種祝福嗎，牧師？
{\fs12}Is that a blessing, Reverend?{\r}

491
00:48:17,137 --> 00:48:19,107
這是一種祝福。
{\fs12}It's a blessing.{\r}

492
00:48:22,934 --> 00:48:24,120
謝謝。
{\fs12}Thank you.{\r}

493
00:49:51,684 --> 00:49:55,068
容易，男孩。現在很容易。
{\fs12}Easy, boy. Easy now.{\r}

494
00:49:56,013 --> 00:49:58,486
沒關係。沒關係。
{\fs12}It's OK. It's OK.{\r}

495
00:50:37,872 --> 00:50:40,304
他吃得好。他的喉嚨沒有傷痕累累。
{\fs12}He eats alright. His throat ain't scarred.{\r}

496
00:50:40,424 --> 00:50:42,475
那為什麼他不像以前那樣吠叫？
{\fs12}Then why don't he bark like he used to?{\r}

497
00:50:42,595 --> 00:50:43,922
哦，他會。
{\fs12}Oh, he will.{\r}

498
00:50:46,113 --> 00:50:47,701
下來，像負鼠一樣行事。
{\fs12}Get down and act like a possum.{\r}

499
00:50:47,821 --> 00:50:49,470
我看起來不像沒有負鼠。
{\fs12}I don't look like no possum.{\r}

500
00:50:49,590 --> 00:50:51,139
像一個人！
{\fs12}Act like one!{\r}

501
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:00,988
得到他，男孩，得到他！
{\fs12}Get him, boy, get him!{\r}

502
00:51:01,108 --> 00:51:03,139
不要告訴那隻狗給我！
{\fs12}Don't tell that dog to get me!{\r}

503
00:51:03,259 --> 00:51:04,622
哦閉嘴。
{\fs12}Oh, shut up.{\r}

504
00:51:04,742 --> 00:51:07,194
你為什麼不給自己一條新狗？
{\fs12}Why don't you get yourself a new dog?{\r}

505
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:21,104
...在Anthony Lorring博士相信她的謊言之後，她放棄了...
{\fs12}...after Dr. Anthony Lorring believed a lie about her, and discarded her...{\r}

506
00:51:21,224 --> 00:51:24,501
...他的妻子米利森特被騙了。
{\fs12}...and was tricked into marriage by his wife Millicent.{\r}

507
00:51:25,091 --> 00:51:27,974
對於艾倫剛剛對邁克爾說：
{\fs12}For Ellen has just said to Michael:{\r}

508
00:51:28,094 --> 00:51:33,689
“邁克爾，你一遍又一遍地讓我為我們的婚姻命名一天...”
{\fs12}"Michael, over and over you've asked me to name a day for our marriage..."{\r}

509
00:51:33,809 --> 00:51:35,955
“好吧，現在我已經準備好了。”
{\fs12}"Well, now I'm ready to do it."{\r}

510
00:51:36,075 --> 00:51:40,411
“如果你想要我，我會在這個下午嫁給你。” - 柏瑞特女士？
{\fs12}-"I'll marry you this very afternoon, if you want me to." -Ms. Boatwright?{\r}

511
00:51:40,531 --> 00:51:42,754
“我會和你一起離開辛普森維爾...”
{\fs12}"I'll go away from Simpsonville with you..."{\r}

512
00:51:42,874 --> 00:51:45,777
 - 柏瑞特女士！ -“...每當你想要我的時候。”
{\fs12}-Ms. Boatwright!   -"...whenever you want me to."{\r}

513
00:51:45,897 --> 00:51:47,373
半小時以前...
{\fs12}Half an hour ago...{\r}

514
00:51:47,493 --> 00:51:51,067
... Ellen和Anthony Lorring以及他鬥氣的妻子Millicent ...

{\fs12}...Ellen and Anthony Lorring and his vindictive wife Millicent...{\r}

515
00:51:51,187 --> 00:51:54,515
...誰討厭艾倫，並發誓要摧毀艾倫和安東尼...
{\fs12}...who hates Ellen, and has sworn to destroy both Ellen and Anthony...{\r}

516
00:51:54,635 --> 00:51:55,632
柏瑞特女士！
{\fs12}Ms. Boatwright!{\r}

517
00:51:55,752 --> 00:51:59,882
...面對年輕的花花公子佈魯斯考菲爾德在他的病房...
{\fs12}...faced the young playboy Bruce Caufield in his hospital room...{\r}

518
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:04,974
...聽到布魯斯透露，米利森特（曾與他秘密結婚）是...
{\fs12}...and heard Bruce reveal that Millicent (once secretly married to him) is...{\r}

519
00:52:09,284 --> 00:52:10,349
大衛！
{\fs12}David!{\r}

520
00:52:11,977 --> 00:52:13,847
你想要一杯清涼的飲料嗎？
{\fs12}Would you like a cool drink?{\r}

521
00:52:14,409 --> 00:52:15,656
不，謝謝。
{\fs12}No, thank you.{\r}

522
00:52:16,098 --> 00:52:18,848
我今天在這個領域有一些工作要做。
{\fs12}I've got some work to do in the field today.{\r}

523
00:52:21,128 --> 00:52:22,375
柏瑞特女士？
{\fs12}Ms. Boatwright?{\r}

524
00:52:22,495 --> 00:52:23,701
是的，大衛？
{\fs12}Yes, David?{\r}

525
00:52:24,787 --> 00:52:28,525
你能幫我找出他們送給我父親的營地嗎？
{\fs12}Would you help me find out what camp they sent my father to?{\r}

526
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:32,179
那麼，法院有關於這樣的事情的規則，大衛，但...
{\fs12}Well, the courthouse has rules about things like that, David, but...{\r}

527
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:34,551
好吧，我會問鎮周圍的事情。
{\fs12}Well, I'll ask around town about it.{\r}

528
00:52:36,661 --> 00:52:38,832
明天見，柏瑞特女士。
{\fs12}See you tomorrow, Ms. Boatwright.{\r}

529
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:41,075
大衛...
{\fs12}David...{\r}

530
00:52:43,809 --> 00:52:46,482
我會找出你爸爸給你的地方。
{\fs12}I'll find out where your daddy is for you.{\r}

531
00:52:50,227 --> 00:52:52,076
謝謝，柏瑞特女士。
{\fs12}Thanks, Ms. Boatwright.{\r}

532
00:52:53,946 --> 00:52:57,644
大衛，你沒有向任何人提起這件事！你聽到了嗎？
{\fs12}You don't mention this to anybody, David! Do you hear me?{\r}

533
00:53:15,909 --> 00:53:17,939
我不能那樣做，麗塔！
{\fs12}I can't do that, Rita!{\r}

534
00:53:18,602 --> 00:53:21,758
現在，我們在這裡制定了關於有色囚犯的政策。
{\fs12}Now, we have a policy here on colored prisoners.{\r}

535
00:53:21,878 --> 00:53:24,663
即使我們是好朋友，我也不會改變這種狀況。
{\fs12}And I ain't about to change that, even though we're good friends.{\r}

536
00:53:24,783 --> 00:53:27,364
查理，只是因為一個男人和他的家人都有色...
{\fs12}Charlie, just because a man and his family are colored...{\r}

537
00:53:27,484 --> 00:53:30,058
看：我沒有製定規則，麗塔！
{\fs12}Look: I don't make the rules, Rita!{\r}

538
00:53:30,178 --> 00:53:34,345
而且你要把自己放在一邊，讓我做這樣的事情！
{\fs12}And you're putting yourself out on a limb, asking me to do such a thing!{\r}

539
00:53:34,465 --> 00:53:37,099
如果我因為...而要危害我的工作，我會被詛咒
{\fs12}And I'll be damned if I'm going to jeopardize my job just because...{\r}

540
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:39,370
...你愛上了一個有色人種的小男孩！
{\fs12}...you're in love with a little colored boy!{\r}

541
00:53:40,077 --> 00:53:41,303
勞駕。
{\fs12}Excuse me.{\r}

542
00:53:45,711 --> 00:53:50,206
年輕人在這裡楊警長在這裡。
{\fs12}Young here. Sheriff Young here.{\r}

543
00:53:50,326 --> 00:53:54,060
是的，先生...是的，先生。
{\fs12}Yes, sir...yes, sir.{\r}

544
00:53:55,120 --> 00:53:57,773
你打賭你的生活，先生。我會馬上結束。
{\fs12}You bet your life, sir. I'll be right over.{\r}

545
00:53:59,783 --> 00:54:01,433
那是埃利奧特法官。
{\fs12}That was Judge Elliott.{\r}

546
00:54:01,553 --> 00:54:04,326
當艾略特法官給我打電話時，我跳了！
{\fs12}When Judge Elliott calls me, I jump!{\r}

547
00:54:06,294 --> 00:54:07,661
再見，麗塔。
{\fs12}Goodbye, Rita.{\r}

548
00:54:10,113 --> 00:54:11,701
但是，查理...
{\fs12}But, Charlie...{\r}

549
00:54:12,304 --> 00:54:15,159
不不不！
{\fs12}No. N-O: no!{\r}

550
00:55:29,196 --> 00:55:31,707
你有沒有找到你要找的東西？
{\fs12}Did you find what you were looking for?{\r}

551
00:55:32,451 --> 00:55:33,637
好吧，我...
{\fs12}Well, I...{\r}

552
00:55:33,757 --> 00:55:35,466
我確實看了，查理，但...
{\fs12}I did look, Charlie, but...{\r}

553
00:55:35,586 --> 00:55:37,537
麗塔，沒有“但是”。
{\fs12}No "buts" about it, Rita.{\r}

554
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:42,348
查理，你沒有合法權利不告訴那個男孩他父親在哪裡。
{\fs12}Charlie, you have no legal right not to tell that boy where his father is.{\r}

555
00:55:42,468 --> 00:55:45,815
你聽到了嗎？你和這個該死的法院。
{\fs12}Do you hear that? You and this whole damn courthouse.{\r}

556
00:55:45,935 --> 00:55:47,845
你做的是錯的。
{\fs12}What you're doing is wrong.{\r}

557
00:55:48,187 --> 00:55:50,156
你告訴我錯了！
{\fs12}You tell me about wrong!{\r}

558
00:55:50,759 --> 00:55:55,181
現在，你作為朋友來到這裡，我發現你要瀏覽這些文件？
{\fs12}Now, you come in here as a friend, and I find you going through the files?{\r}

559
00:55:55,301 --> 00:55:57,848
你知道我可以為你逮捕嗎？
{\fs12}You know I could have you arrested for that?{\r}

560
00:55:57,968 --> 00:56:01,245
如果你提供這些信息，那正是我要對你做的！
{\fs12}If you give that information out, that's exactly what I'm going to do to you!{\r}

561
00:56:01,365 --> 00:56:03,939
我會告訴整個城鎮你是如何獲得這些信息的...

{\fs12}And I'll tell this whole town how you got that information...{\r}

562
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:05,689
...以及你給誰的！
{\fs12}...and who you're giving it to!{\r}

563
00:56:05,809 --> 00:56:10,171
你不會在這個教區留下一個朋友...帶給你一塊糖果！
{\fs12}And you won't have a friend left in this parish to...bring you a piece of candy!{\r}

564
00:56:10,291 --> 00:56:12,643
你會那樣做的，不是嗎？
{\fs12}You would do that, wouldn't you?{\r}

565
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:16,201
現在你明白了，柏瑞特太太。
{\fs12}Now you're getting the point, Mrs. Boatwright.{\r}

566
00:56:36,917 --> 00:56:39,115
讓我們離開這裡，大衛李。
{\fs12}Let's get out of here, David Lee.{\r}

567
00:56:52,133 --> 00:56:53,560
柏瑞特女士...
{\fs12}Ms. Boatwright...{\r}

568
00:56:54,163 --> 00:56:56,706
你知道我父親在哪裡，不是嗎？
{\fs12}You know where my father is, don't you?{\r}

569
00:56:56,826 --> 00:56:57,851
沒有。
{\fs12}No.{\r}

570
00:56:58,173 --> 00:57:00,686
他錯了，大衛：我沒有發現。
{\fs12}He was wrong, David: I didn't find out.{\r}

571
00:57:02,498 --> 00:57:03,865
柏瑞特女士，我見過你。
{\fs12}Ms. Boatwright, I saw you.{\r}

572
00:57:03,985 --> 00:57:06,237
你看了看那裡，你發現了我父親的位置。
{\fs12}You looked in there, and you found out where my father is.{\r}

573
00:57:06,357 --> 00:57:08,669
如果我說我沒有，大衛，這就是我的意思。
{\fs12}If I say I didn't, David, that's what I mean.{\r}

574
00:57:08,789 --> 00:57:12,110
 -小船女士...  -我不知道該死的。現在停止打擾我。
{\fs12}-Ms. Boat... -I don't know a damn thing. Now stop bothering me about it.{\r}

575
00:57:12,230 --> 00:57:13,436
來。
{\fs12}Come.{\r}

576
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:15,581
我帶你回家
{\fs12}I'll take you home.{\r}

577
00:57:15,701 --> 00:57:16,948
我會走路。
{\fs12}I'll walk.{\r}

578
00:57:17,833 --> 00:57:20,426
現在，不要大喊大衛。這是一次漫長的旅行。
{\fs12}Now, don't pout now, David. It's a long trip.{\r}

579
00:57:20,546 --> 00:57:22,383
我習慣了。
{\fs12}I'm used to it.{\r}

580
00:57:23,006 --> 00:57:25,318
好吧，你不能說我沒試過。
{\fs12}Well, you can't say I didn't try.{\r}

581
00:58:24,183 --> 00:58:25,570
你好，大衛。
{\fs12}Hello, David.{\r}

582
00:58:27,178 --> 00:58:28,646
嗨，柏瑞特女士。
{\fs12}Hi, Ms. Boatwright.{\r}

583
00:58:28,969 --> 00:58:31,401
我對前幾天採取行動的方式感到抱歉。
{\fs12}I'm sorry about the way I acted the other day.{\r}

584
00:58:31,521 --> 00:58:33,551
大衛，沒有必要對不起。
{\fs12}Well, there's no need to be sorry, David.{\r}

585
00:58:34,436 --> 00:58:37,442
 -你的媽媽在哪裡？ -我在這裡，柏瑞特女士。
{\fs12}-Where's your mama?   -Here I is, Ms. Boatwright.{\r}

586
00:58:43,944 --> 00:58:46,437
納森所在的營地...
{\fs12}The camp where Nathan is at...{\r}

587
00:58:46,557 --> 00:58:48,708
...被稱為Wishbone勞教所。
{\fs12}...is called Wishbone Labor Camp.{\r}

588
00:58:49,995 --> 00:58:51,613
而且，嗯...
{\fs12}And, um...{\r}

589
00:58:51,733 --> 00:58:53,809
...它在Nolantown。
{\fs12}...it's in Nolantown.{\r}

590
00:58:53,929 --> 00:58:57,901
柏瑞特女士，你肯定是個瘋狂的女人。
{\fs12}You sure is a crazy-acting woman sometimes, Ms. Boatwright.{\r}

591
00:59:09,454 --> 00:59:12,787
現在，嗯，我們從A-2前往，嗯...
{\fs12}Now, um, we go from A-2, to, um...{\r}

592
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,237
現在，讓我看看我們從哪裡開始...
{\fs12}Now, let me see where we go from here...{\r}

593
00:59:18,357 --> 00:59:20,227
柏瑞特女士，你有麻煩嗎？
{\fs12}Are you having trouble, Ms. Boatwright?{\r}

594
00:59:20,347 --> 00:59:24,328
哦，不，不，不：這些地圖很容易閱讀，但是，嗯...
{\fs12}Oh, no, no, no: these maps are easy to read, but, um...{\r}

595
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:28,509
就在那裡，就在那裡。
{\fs12}There it is, right there.{\r}

596
00:59:28,629 --> 00:59:30,449
你怎麼去那裡的，柏瑞特女士？
{\fs12}How do you get there, Ms. Boatwright?{\r}

597
00:59:30,569 --> 00:59:32,053
嗯，嗯...
{\fs12}Well, um...{\r}

598
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:36,555
這裡有數字和字母顯示你在地圖上的位置...
{\fs12}There are numbers and letters on here to show you where to look on the map...{\r}

599
00:59:36,675 --> 00:59:38,089
...但是，嗯...
{\fs12}...but, um...{\r}

600
00:59:38,209 --> 00:59:41,134
好吧，諾蘭斯敦不在一個數字之下。
{\fs12}Well, Nolanstown isn't under a number.{\r}

601
00:59:41,254 --> 00:59:44,455
但我們知道它位於蘭斯敦北部...
{\fs12}But we know that it's in northern Lansdowne...{\r}

602
00:59:44,575 --> 00:59:48,275
...而蘭斯敦北部的數字是H-7。
{\fs12}...and the number for northern Lansdowne is H-7.{\r}

603
00:59:49,059 --> 00:59:50,265
但是，嗯...
{\fs12}But, um...{\r}

604
00:59:50,385 --> 00:59:56,207
由於蘭斯敦是最大的教區，它實際上延伸到A-2 ...
{\fs12}Since Lansdowne is the largest parish, it actually stretches across into A-2...{\r}

605
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,614
...而且，呃...
{\fs12}...and, uh...{\r}

606
00:59:58,734 --> 01:00:01,208
A-2 ...是，嗯...
{\fs12}A-2...is, um...{\r}

607
01:00:03,439 --> 01:00:05,208
我清楚了嗎？
{\fs12}Am I making myself clear?{\r}

608
01:00:05,328 --> 01:00:10,302
哦，是的。哦，是的，很清楚，柏瑞特女士。我相信我們會找到它。
{\fs12}Oh, yes. Oh, yes, it's clear, Ms. Boatwright. I'm sure we'll find it.{\r}

609
01:00:10,422 --> 01:00:13,307
我的意思是，當我們找到那個地方的時候，我們會找到它。
{\fs12}I mean, when the time comes for us to find that place, we'll find it.{\r}

610
01:00:13,427 --> 01:00:16,530
 -孩子，我們不是嗎？ -是的女士。 -是的女士。 -哦，是的，我們會找到的。
{\fs12}-Won't we, children? -Yes, ma'am.   -Yes, ma'am. -Oh, yes, we'll find it.{\r}

611
01:00:16,650 --> 01:00:17,776
是的，我們會。
{\fs12}Yes we will.{\r}

612
01:00:45,018 --> 01:00:46,485
嗨男孩！
{\fs12}Hey, boy!{\r}

613
01:00:48,996 --> 01:00:51,649
男孩，你變得沉重。嘿，桑德！
{\fs12}Boy, you're getting heavy. Hey, Sounder!{\r}

614
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:57,279
男孩，你看起來很好。嘿，我會把你帶到那個樹樁上。你準備好了嗎？
{\fs12}Boy, you're looking good. Hey, I'll race you to that tree stump. You ready?{\r}

615
01:00:58,185 --> 01:00:59,501
走！來吧！
{\fs12}Go! Come on!{\r}

616
01:01:03,974 --> 01:01:06,325
你可以跑得更快，加油！
{\fs12}You can run faster than that, come on!{\r}

617
01:01:34,214 --> 01:01:35,944
然後，你去諾蘭後...
{\fs12}Then, after you go by Nolan...{\r}

618
01:01:36,064 --> 01:01:38,717
...你要去的第一條路就是喬丹路。
{\fs12}...the first road you're gonna come to is that Jordan Road.{\r}

619
01:01:38,837 --> 01:01:40,023
而且，嗯...
{\fs12}And, um...{\r}

620
01:01:40,143 --> 01:01:42,383
...你一直走到喬丹路盡頭...

{\fs12}...you go all the way down to the end of the Jordan Road...{\r}

621
01:01:42,503 --> 01:01:44,423
...到勞教所，那就是它...
{\fs12}...to the labor camp, that's where it is...{\r}

622
01:01:44,543 --> 01:01:46,392
...就在路的盡頭。現在，看看：
{\fs12}...right at the end of the road. Now, look:{\r}

623
01:01:46,512 --> 01:01:49,887
這將是一次長途旅行。而且，呃，祝你好運！

{\fs12}It's going to be a long trip. And, uh, good luck to you!{\r}

624
01:01:50,007 --> 01:01:54,137
 -謝謝，艾克先生。 -好吧，大衛李。這是你的食物和東西。
{\fs12}-Thanks, Mr. Ike. -Alright, David Lee. Here's your food and things.{\r}

625
01:01:55,332 --> 01:01:58,287
如果你累了，你會去火車站或教堂休息。
{\fs12}If you get tired, you go into a railroad station or a church to rest.{\r}

626
01:01:58,407 --> 01:02:00,653
 -你聽說，你不去無人的家嗎？ -是的女士。

{\fs12}-Don't you go to nobody's house, you hear? -Yes, ma'am.{\r}

627
01:02:00,773 --> 01:02:05,457
而且你告訴你爸爸發一些關於他什麼時候回家的消息。
{\fs12}And you tell your daddy to send some word about what time he's gonna be home.{\r}

628
01:02:05,577 --> 01:02:08,728
 -告訴他我愛他，聽到了嗎？ -告訴他我也說“嗨”。
{\fs12}-And tell him I love him, hear?   -Tell him I said "hi," too.{\r}

629
01:02:08,848 --> 01:02:11,964
好的，現在開始吧。你失去了日光。
{\fs12}Alright, now get a move on. You're losing daylight.{\r}

630
01:02:15,241 --> 01:02:17,210
來吧，桑德。來吧。
{\fs12}Come on, Sounder. Come on.{\r}

631
01:02:54,587 --> 01:02:57,893

{\fs12}Jesus, will you come by here?{\r}

634
01:03:08,953 --> 01:03:14,765
現在是一個有需要的時間，哦，現在是一個貧困的時間...
{\fs12}Now is a needy time, oh, now is a needy time...{\r}

635
01:03:16,088 --> 01:03:20,608
現在是一個有需要的時間。
{\fs12}Now is a needy time.{\r}

636
01:03:24,108 --> 01:03:30,021
來吧，如果你不長久，哦，來吧，如果你不長久...

637
01:03:31,203 --> 01:03:35,509
來吧，如果你不長久。
{\fs12}Come, if you don't stay long.{\r}

638
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:43,219
現在是一個有需要的時間，哦，現在是一個貧困的時間...
{\fs12}Now is a needy time, oh, now is a needy time...{\r}

639
01:03:44,163 --> 01:03:48,374
現在是一個有需要的時間。
{\fs12}Now is a needy time.{\r}

640
01:04:17,484 --> 01:04:23,481
在我的膝蓋和祈禱，我跪下祈禱...
{\fs12}Down on my knees and praying, I'm down on my knees and praying...{\r}

641
01:04:23,951 --> 01:04:27,810
耶穌，你不會來這裡嗎？
{\fs12}Jesus, won't you come by here?{\r}

642
01:04:29,685 --> 01:04:35,587

01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:42,243
你認識我的父親納森李.摩根嗎？
{\fs12}Do you know my father, Nathan Lee Morgan?{\r}

650
01:06:42,363 --> 01:06:46,067
男孩，從未聽說過他。我們在那個監獄裡有很多男人。
{\fs12}Never heard of him, boy. We've got lots of men in that prison.{\r}

651
01:07:40,001 --> 01:07:41,368
先生！

是啊。

{\fs12}Mister, is Nathan Lee Morgan here?{\r}

657
01:07:53,912 --> 01:07:58,315
這裡沒有人叫摩根。現在在你讓我們陷入困境之前離開。

{\fs12}There's nobody here named Morgan. Now get away before you get us in trouble.{\r}

658
01:08:47,849 --> 01:08:49,336

約翰遜女士？
{\fs12}Ms. Johnson?{\r}

723
01:13:49,731 --> 01:13:53,049
難道你不在你的學校教導沒有死的人嗎？
{\fs12}Don't you teach in your school about folk who ain't dead?{\r}

724
01:13:53,169 --> 01:13:54,415

約翰遜女士，你是個好女人。
{\fs12}You're a nice lady, Ms. Johnson.{\r}

741
01:15:01,409 --> 01:15:04,130
好的。好的。
{\fs12}Alright. Alright.{\r}

742
01:15:04,894 --> 01:15:06,723
讓我們停止笑。
{\fs12}Let's stop the laughing.{\r}

743
01:15:06,843 --> 01:15:08,492
還有誰有故事告訴我們？
{\fs12}Who else has a story to tell us?{\r}

744
01:15:09,417 --> 01:15:13,290
我有一個故事，約翰遜女士。一個發生在我身上的真實故事。
{\fs12}I got a story, Ms. Johnson. A true story that happened to me.{\r}

745
01:15:14,088 --> 01:15:17,304
克拉倫斯，你知道課程會挑戰你的故事，不是嗎？
{\fs12}You know the class is going to challenge your story, don't you, Clarence?{\r}

746
01:15:17,424 --> 01:15:19,142
是的，約翰遜女士。
{\fs12}Yes, Ms. Johnson.{\r}

747
01:15:19,262 --> 01:15:20,810
好的，繼續。
{\fs12}Alright, go on.{\r}

748

我和我的妹妹上週六去了水洞。
{\fs12}Me and my little sister went down to the water hole last Saturday.{\r}

749
01:15:26,005 --> 01:15:30,619
你們都做錯了什麼。你沒告訴我們你妹妹的名字。
{\fs12}You all was doing something wrong. You didn't tell us the name of your sister.{\r}

750
01:15:30,739 --> 01:15:34,807
我和我的妹妹勞拉上週六去了水洞。
{\fs12}Me and my sister Laura went down to the water hole last Saturday.{\r}

751
01:15:34,927 --> 01:15:37,360
我們沿著水邊玩耍。
{\fs12}We was playing along the edge of the water.{\r}

752
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:39,691
勞拉滑倒了，掉進了水里。
{\fs12}Laura slipped and fell into the water.{\r}

753
01:15:39,811 --> 01:15:44,850
我開始跑回家了。但我轉身，跑回去，潛入水中...
{\fs12}I started to run back home. But I turned around, ran back, dove into the water...{\r}

754
01:15:44,970 --> 01:15:47,443
...在她淹死之前讓她出去了。
{\fs12}...and got her out before she could drown.{\r}

755
01:15:47,563 --> 01:15:50,114
在你把她從水里拉出來之後，你妹妹怎麼樣？
{\fs12}How was your sister after you pulled her out of the water?{\r}

756
01:15:50,234 --> 01:15:52,224
她又髒又濕。
{\fs12}She was dirty and wet.{\r}

757
01:15:52,344 --> 01:15:53,752
是什麼讓你跑？
{\fs12}What made you run?{\r}

758
01:15:53,872 --> 01:15:56,124
我回家去找我爸爸。
{\fs12}I was going home to get my daddy.{\r}

759
01:15:56,244 --> 01:15:58,335
是什麼讓你停下來回去？
{\fs12}What made you stop and go back?{\r}

760
01:15:58,455 --> 01:16:00,222
因為如果我跑回家...
{\fs12}Cause if I had ran home...{\r}

761
01:16:00,342 --> 01:16:03,458
...當我應該回來的時候，我妹妹會淹死。
{\fs12}...by the time I should have got back, my sister would have drowned.{\r}

762
01:16:03,578 --> 01:16:05,951
你怎麼一開始不知道的？
{\fs12}How come you didn't know that at first?{\r}

763
01:16:06,071 --> 01:16:07,199
因為我很害怕。
{\fs12}Cause I was scared.{\r}

764
01:16:07,319 --> 01:16:10,476
拿著它！克拉倫斯的故事並非如此。
{\fs12}Hold it! Clarence's story ain't true.{\r}

765
01:16:10,958 --> 01:16:15,541
我和克拉倫斯很多次去過河邊，我知道他不會游泳！
{\fs12}Me and Clarence went to the river a lot of times, and I know he can't swim!{\r}

766
01:16:23,304 --> 01:16:27,887
克拉倫斯？在告訴我們之後，你能告訴我們一個不真實的故事嗎？
{\fs12}Clarence? Would you tell us a story that was not true, after telling us it was?{\r}

767
01:16:28,422 --> 01:16:30,030
不，約翰遜女士。
{\fs12}No, Ms. Johnson.{\r}

768
01:16:30,150 --> 01:16:31,438
你會游泳嗎？
{\fs12}Can you swim?{\r}

769
01:16:31,558 --> 01:16:32,503
是的女士。
{\fs12}Yes, ma'am.{\r}

770
01:16:32,623 --> 01:16:36,863
克拉倫斯！你知道你不會游泳。里奇先生每次都向你展示...
{\fs12}Clarence! You know you can't swim. Every time Mr. Richie showed you...{\r}

771
01:16:36,983 --> 01:16:40,254
你摔倒了我不得不一直把你拉出來。
{\fs12}...you fell down. And I had to always pull you out.{\r}

772
01:16:45,034 --> 01:16:46,401
是的女士。
{\fs12}Yes, ma'am.{\r}

773
01:16:46,521 --> 01:16:50,561
但是，當我看到我的妹妹即將被淹死在水中時...
{\fs12}But when I saw my sister about to drown in the water...{\r}

774
01:16:50,681 --> 01:16:53,657
我試過了，因為我不再害怕了。
{\fs12}I tried, because I wasn't scared anymore.{\r}

775
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:58,172
我只是游泳和踢。我不知道我是怎麼做的，但我是。
{\fs12}I was just swimming and kicking. I don't know how I was doing it, but I was.{\r}

776
01:16:58,292 --> 01:17:01,488
因為我姐姐溺水了。她溺水了！
{\fs12}Because my sister was drowning. She was drowning!{\r}

777
01:17:03,197 --> 01:17:05,680
我相信克拉倫斯的故事。
{\fs12}I believe Clarence's story.{\r}

778
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:08,735
大衛，你想站起來告訴我們原因嗎？
{\fs12}Do you want to stand up and tell us why, David?{\r}

779
01:17:11,957 --> 01:17:15,314
嗯...有些人來找我父親。
{\fs12}Well...some people came and took my father away.{\r}

780
01:17:15,757 --> 01:17:19,938
其他人說我們無法在農場工作。但我們必須這樣做。
{\fs12}And other people said we couldn't work the farm. But we had to.{\r}

781
01:17:20,058 --> 01:17:22,450
否則我們會失去農場。
{\fs12}Or else we would have lost the farm.{\r}

782
01:17:22,570 --> 01:17:25,666
但我們種植了莊稼並且他們長大了。
{\fs12}But we planted the crops and they grew.{\r}

783
01:17:25,786 --> 01:17:28,809
我相信克拉倫斯的故事是因為他做了什麼。
{\fs12}I believe Clarence's story because of what he did.{\r}

784
01:17:28,929 --> 01:17:33,352
他不會游泳，但他不得不游泳！否則他的妹妹會被淹死！
{\fs12}He couldn't swim, but he had to! Else his sister would have drowned!{\r}

785
01:17:36,627 --> 01:17:38,617
這就是他如何做到的。
{\fs12}And that's how he did it.{\r}

786
01:17:55,017 --> 01:17:58,977
你知道，這是你今天在課堂上為克拉倫斯所做的一件好事。
{\fs12}You know, that was a good thing you did for Clarence in class today.{\r}

787
01:17:59,097 --> 01:18:00,806
我相信他的故事。
{\fs12}I believed his story.{\r}

788
01:18:00,926 --> 01:18:03,734
但我害怕其他孩子不會。
{\fs12}But I was afraid the other children wouldn't.{\r}

789
01:18:04,336 --> 01:18:08,156
我知道他害怕一站起來就沒有人會相信他。
{\fs12}I knew he was scared nobody would believe him as soon as he stood up.{\r}

790
01:18:08,276 --> 01:18:10,507
你呢？怎麼樣？
{\fs12}You did? How?{\r}

791
01:18:10,627 --> 01:18:13,055
我自己一直都喜歡這樣。
{\fs12}I've been like that sometimes, myself.{\r}

792
01:18:13,175 --> 01:18:15,387
以為沒有人會相信我。
{\fs12}Thinking nobody would believe me.{\r}

793
01:18:17,258 --> 01:18:19,952
 -你想听另一個故事嗎？ -不是現在，大衛。
{\fs12}-You want to hear another story? -Not now, David.{\r}

794
01:18:20,072 --> 01:18:24,253
現在已經很晚了，你早上還有很長一段路程。
{\fs12}It's getting late and you have a long trip ahead of you in the morning.{\r}

795
01:18:45,826 --> 01:18:49,130
那你在看什麼？沒什麼好看的。
{\fs12}What are you looking at out there? There's nothing to see.{\r}

796
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,703
爸爸總是眺望黑暗。
{\fs12}Daddy always looks out into the dark.{\r}

797
01:18:52,928 --> 01:18:55,119
即使沒有什麼可看的。
{\fs12}Even when there's nothing to see.{\r}

798
01:18:55,441 --> 01:18:57,310
他說這是你聽到的。
{\fs12}He says it's what you hear.{\r}

799
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:59,651
你想想你的父親很多，不是嗎？
{\fs12}You think about your father a lot, don't you?{\r}

800
01:18:59,771 --> 01:19:00,938
是的女士。
{\fs12}Yes, ma'am.{\r}

801
01:19:01,761 --> 01:19:04,746
大衛，你不應該太擔心他。
{\fs12}You shouldn't worry about him too much, David.{\r}

802
01:19:06,072 --> 01:19:09,096
但是當我回到家時，我會告訴媽媽什麼？
{\fs12}But what am I going to tell Mama when I get home?{\r}

803
01:19:09,398 --> 01:19:13,478
告訴她我沒看到爸爸？這就是我想要做的！
{\fs12}Tell her that I didn't see Daddy? And that's what I wanted to do!{\r}

804
01:19:13,598 --> 01:19:15,609
但你盡力而為。
{\fs12}But you did all you could.{\r}

805
01:19:15,729 --> 01:19:18,422
沒有多少小男孩可以像你一樣去過這樣的旅程。
{\fs12}Not many little boys could have gone on such a journey as you did.{\r}

806
01:19:18,542 --> 01:19:20,091
但是爸爸在哪裡？
{\fs12}But where's Daddy?{\r}

807
01:19:22,179 --> 01:19:24,069
我無法回答你的問題。
{\fs12}I can't answer that for you.{\r}

808
01:19:24,631 --> 01:19:28,832
但是，你不知道你父親在哪裡，這不是你自己的錯。
{\fs12}But it's no fault of your own that you don't know where your father is.{\r}

809
01:19:28,952 --> 01:19:32,197
告訴我你做了什麼讓你無法找到你的父親。
{\fs12}Tell me what you did that kept you from finding your father.{\r}

810
01:19:32,317 --> 01:19:34,308
嗯？拜託告訴我！
{\fs12}Hmm? Come on, tell me!{\r}

811
01:19:34,428 --> 01:19:35,654
沒有。
{\fs12}Nothing.{\r}

812
01:19:35,774 --> 01:19:37,885
所以你做了你的工作，對嗎？
{\fs12}And so you did your job, right?{\r}

813
01:19:39,637 --> 01:19:41,044
是的女士。
{\fs12}Yes, ma'am.{\r}

814
01:19:42,311 --> 01:19:45,627
男孩...你肯定會讓我的思緒跳躍！
{\fs12}Boy...you sure keep my mind jumping!{\r}

815
01:19:46,638 --> 01:19:48,682
這意味著什麼？
{\fs12}And what does that mean?{\r}

816
01:19:48,802 --> 01:19:52,349
這意味著你讓我用我的頭，這很好。
{\fs12}That means you keep me using my head, and that's good.{\r}

817
01:19:53,113 --> 01:19:54,600
約翰遜女士？
{\fs12}Ms. Johnson?{\r}

818
01:19:56,697 --> 01:20:02,366
你以為我可以回到這裡...與其他孩子一起上學？
{\fs12}You think I can come back here and... study school with the other children?{\r}

819
01:20:31,523 --> 01:20:32,927
滿了嗎？
{\fs12}Full yet?{\r}

820
01:20:33,232 --> 01:20:34,155
精細。
{\fs12}Fine.{\r}

821
01:20:34,275 --> 01:20:36,901
媽媽，媽媽！喬西梅！厄爾！
{\fs12}Mama, mama! Josie Mae! Earl!{\r}

822
01:20:38,377 --> 01:20:39,893
 -大衛李！ -大衛李！
{\fs12}-David Lee! -David Lee!{\r}

823
01:20:41,857 --> 01:20:43,010
大衛李？
{\fs12}David Lee?{\r}

824
01:20:45,498 --> 01:20:46,822
大衛李？
{\fs12}David Lee?{\r}

825
01:20:47,569 --> 01:20:51,266
主啊，男孩，你去過哪裡？你讓我擔心我的想法！
{\fs12}Lord, boy, where have you been? You had me worried out of my mind!{\r}

826
01:20:51,386 --> 01:20:53,359
你找到你的爸爸？
{\fs12}You find your daddy?{\r}

827
01:20:53,479 --> 01:20:55,174
不，我沒有看到他。
{\fs12}No, I didn't see him.{\r}

828
01:20:55,294 --> 01:20:58,099
那些人說他們不認識爸爸。
{\fs12}The men said they didn't know Daddy.{\r}

829
01:20:58,219 --> 01:21:00,021
猜猜他們把他送到了另一個營地。
{\fs12}Guess they sent him off to another camp.{\r}

830
01:21:00,141 --> 01:21:02,694
為什麼你的包很重？那裡有什麼？
{\fs12}Why's your bag so heavy? What's in there?{\r}

831
01:21:02,814 --> 01:21:04,543
約翰遜女士給我的一些書。
{\fs12}Some books Ms. Johnson gave me.{\r}

832
01:21:04,663 --> 01:21:06,080
誰是約翰遜女士？
{\fs12}Who's Ms. Johnson?{\r}

833
01:21:06,200 --> 01:21:10,813
哦，她是老師。我有時候一直呆在她家裡。
{\fs12}Oh, she's a teacher. And I stayed over at her house some of the time.{\r}

834
01:21:10,933 --> 01:21:15,617
所以當我離開時，她給了我這些書。
{\fs12}So when I left, she gave me these books.{\r}

835
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:17,674
好...
{\fs12}Well...{\r}

836
01:21:19,361 --> 01:21:22,006
約翰遜女士一定是個好女人。
{\fs12}Ms. Johnson must be a right nice lady.{\r}

837
01:21:22,126 --> 01:21:24,056
噢，她是，媽媽。
{\fs12}Oh, she is, Mama.{\r}

838
01:21:27,237 --> 01:21:28,689
媽媽...
{\fs12}Mama...{\r}

839
01:21:29,215 --> 01:21:33,015
秋天到來時，約翰遜女士要我去她的學校。
{\fs12}When the fall comes, Ms. Johnson wants me to go to her school.{\r}

840
01:21:37,115 --> 01:21:39,463
那你怎麼能這樣做？
{\fs12}Well, how can you do that?{\r}

841
01:21:40,530 --> 01:21:43,413
你不會住在那所學校附近。
{\fs12}You don't live nowhere near that school.{\r}

842
01:21:43,533 --> 01:21:46,680
好吧，她說我可以和學生一起生活。
{\fs12}Well, she says I can live with her while school's going on.{\r}

843
01:21:46,800 --> 01:21:50,092
當學校不能繼續學習時，我可以回家。
{\fs12}And when school's not going on, I could come back home.{\r}

844
01:21:54,191 --> 01:21:56,690
那麼，誰能在這裡幫助我呢？
{\fs12}Well, who's going to help me here in the house?{\r}

845
01:21:58,227 --> 01:22:00,213
在現場？
{\fs12}And in the field?{\r}

846
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:09,085
好...
{\fs12}Well...{\r}

847
01:22:09,768 --> 01:22:12,438
也許到那個時候，你爸爸會回來的。
{\fs12}Maybe by that time, your dad will be back.{\r}

848
01:22:12,907 --> 01:22:15,982
如果和他一起好的話，對我來說也沒關係。
{\fs12}If it's alright with him, it's alright with me.{\r}

849
01:23:15,569 --> 01:23:18,409
Giddyup，騾子！混帳！混帳！混帳！混帳！
{\fs12}Giddyup, mule! Git! Git! Git! Git!{\r}

850
01:23:25,472 --> 01:23:26,454
是啊。
{\fs12}Yeah.{\r}

851
01:23:31,340 --> 01:23:33,006
這樣就完成了你的分享。
{\fs12}This finishes your share.{\r}

852
01:23:33,126 --> 01:23:35,568
麗貝卡，你做得很好。
{\fs12}You did a good job cropping, Rebecca.{\r}

853
01:23:46,909 --> 01:23:48,104
Giddyup，騾子！
{\fs12}Giddyup, mule!{\r}

854
01:24:08,826 --> 01:24:13,096
親愛的約翰遜女士，你好嗎？我做得很好。
{\fs12}Dear Ms. Johnson, How are you? I am doing OK.{\r}

855
01:24:13,216 --> 01:24:16,982
我告訴了我的媽媽，我的兄弟和我的妹妹。
{\fs12}I told my mama, my brother, and my sister about you.{\r}

856
01:24:17,446 --> 01:24:19,304
他們也喜歡你。
{\fs12}And they like you too.{\r}

857
01:24:19,424 --> 01:24:23,574
我不能把這封信寫得太長，因為我有工作要做。
{\fs12}I can't make this letter too long because I have work to do.{\r}

858
01:24:23,694 --> 01:24:26,798
祝福你，大衛李.摩根
{\fs12}Bless you, David Lee Morgan{\r}

859
01:24:28,492 --> 01:24:31,246
兒子，你肯定會寫一封很好的信。
{\fs12}You sure write a good fine letter, son.{\r}

860
01:24:32,714 --> 01:24:34,721
一封好的信。
{\fs12}A good fine letter.{\r}

861
01:24:58,755 --> 01:25:00,826
你怎麼了，桑德？
{\fs12}What's wrong with you, Sounder?{\r}

862
01:25:38,809 --> 01:25:40,410
哦，我的上帝。
{\fs12}Oh, my God.{\r}

863
01:25:41,819 --> 01:25:43,207
這是納森。
{\fs12}It's Nathan.{\r}

864
01:25:44,467 --> 01:25:45,808
這是納森。
{\fs12}Nathan!{\r}

865
01:25:48,267 --> 01:25:49,719
這是納森。
{\fs12}Nathan!{\r}

866
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:53,050
媽媽！怎麼了？
{\fs12}Mama! What's the matter?{\r}

867
01:25:53,170 --> 01:25:54,416
納森！
{\fs12}Nathan!{\r}

868
01:25:58,021 --> 01:26:00,391
納森！納森。
{\fs12}Nathan! Nathan.{\r}

869
01:26:01,736 --> 01:26:02,734
爸爸！
{\fs12}Daddy!{\r}

870
01:26:02,854 --> 01:26:05,126
 -爸爸！ -爸爸！
{\fs12}-Daddy! -Daddy!{\r}

871
01:26:05,246 --> 01:26:07,218
 -爸爸！ -爸爸！ -納森！
{\fs12}-Daddy! -Daddy! -Nathan!{\r}

872
01:26:07,517 --> 01:26:09,674
 -爸爸！ -爸爸！
{\fs12}-Daddy! -Daddy!{\r}

873
01:26:09,977 --> 01:26:11,446
 -納森！ -爸爸！
{\fs12}-Nathan! -Daddy!{\r}

874

 -爸爸！ -爸爸！
{\fs12}-Daddy! -Daddy!{\r}

878
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:27,635
Rebec ...麗貝卡。
{\fs12}Rebec...Rebecca.{\r}

879
01:26:28,148 --> 01:26:29,109
爸爸！
{\fs12}Daddy!{\r}

880
01:26:37,291 --> 01:26:38,679
 -納森-嗯。
{\fs12}-Nathan. -Uh-huh.{\r}

881
01:26:44,083 --> 01:26:45,834
嘿!嘿!
{\fs12}Hey! Hey!{\r}

882
01:26:59,334 --> 01:27:01,405
很高興...看著你！
{\fs12}It's good to...look at you!{\r}

883
01:27:02,938 --> 01:27:03,963
嘿!
{\fs12}Hey!{\r}

884
01:27:09,664 --> 01:27:10,674
厄爾
{\fs12}Earl.{\r}

885
01:27:16,916 --> 01:27:19,265
你的腿怎麼了，爸爸？
{\fs12}What's the matter with your leg, Daddy?{\r}

886
01:27:19,385 --> 01:27:21,478
哦。我受傷了
{\fs12}Oh. I got it hurt.{\r}

887
01:27:22,302 --> 01:27:23,925
在炸藥爆炸。
{\fs12}In a dynamite blast.{\r}

888
01:27:24,045 --> 01:27:28,276
當我不再對他們有用時，他們花了一些時間來減刑...
{\fs12}When I wasn't no more use to them, they took some time off my sentence...{\r}

889
01:27:28,396 --> 01:27:30,354
...讓我回家吧！
{\fs12}...and let me come home!{\r}

890
01:27:34,338 --> 01:27:39,014
那是你給我們定的一頓飯，麗貝卡女士，我當然要謝謝你。
{\fs12}That was some meal you fixed for us, Ms. Rebecca, and I sure wanna thank you.{\r}

891
01:27:39,134 --> 01:27:41,529
好吧，我很高興你喜歡它，納森李！
{\fs12}Well, I'm glad you like it, Nathan Lee!{\r}

892
01:27:41,649 --> 01:27:44,476
你知道，我很想念他們的餃子，就像我想念你一樣，厄爾
{\fs12}You know, I missed them dumplings almost as much as I missed you, Earl.{\r}

893
01:27:46,512 --> 01:27:51,012
好吧，孩子，這是你睡前2小時。繼續前進。來吧！
{\fs12}Alright, children, it's 2 hours past your bedtime. Get a move on. Come on!{\r}

894
01:27:51,132 --> 01:27:52,092
你也是，厄爾
{\fs12}You too, Earl.{\r}

895
01:27:52,212 --> 01:27:53,902
晚安，爸爸。
{\fs12}Goodnight, Daddy.{\r}

896

晚安，你這個小東西。

晚安，爸爸。
{\fs12}Goodnight, Daddy.{\r}

898
01:27:59,933 --> 01:28:01,535
晚安回到你身邊。
{\fs12}Goodnight back at you.{\r}

899
01:28:07,055 --> 01:28:09,702
睡覺。脫鞋。你聽？
{\fs12}Go to bed. Take your shoes off. You hear?{\r}

900
01:28:09,822 --> 01:28:12,030
那是你繼續的一段旅程，男孩！
{\fs12}That was some journey you went on, boy!{\r}

901
01:28:13,289 --> 01:28:15,426
爸爸，我很高興你回家了。
{\fs12}Daddy, I'm so glad you're home.{\r}

902
01:28:15,725 --> 01:28:17,881
嗯...我也是，兒子！
{\fs12}Well...me too, son!{\r}

903
01:28:18,001 --> 01:28:19,611
我們再去打獵？
{\fs12}We going hunting again?{\r}

904
01:28:19,731 --> 01:28:22,195
好吧，我們肯定會再去打獵！
{\fs12}Well, sure we're going hunting again!{\r}

905
01:28:22,552 --> 01:28:25,776
你離開的時候我把你的東西清理乾淨了。
{\fs12}I cleaned and oiled your stuff while you was gone.{\r}

906
01:28:27,057 --> 01:28:29,769
 -很好 -你現在轉過來，大衛李。
{\fs12}-Good. -Your turn now, David Lee.{\r}

907
01:28:35,911 --> 01:28:37,342
晚安，爸爸。
{\fs12}Goodnight, Daddy.{\r}

908
01:28:38,431 --> 01:28:40,117
晚安，兒子。
{\fs12}Goodnight, son.{\r}

909
01:28:40,237 --> 01:28:42,263
爸爸，你現在回家了。這就是我想要的。
{\fs12}Daddy, you're home now. That's all I want.{\r}

910
01:28:42,383 --> 01:28:45,274
我不想要別的。只是你回家。
{\fs12}I don't want nothing else. Just you to be home.{\r}

911
01:28:47,668 --> 01:28:49,184
來吧，男孩。
{\fs12}Come here, boy.{\r}

912
01:29:55,833 --> 01:29:57,621
嗨，麗貝卡。
{\fs12}Hi-ya, Rebecca.{\r}

913
01:29:57,741 --> 01:29:58,753
你好。
{\fs12}Hi.{\r}

914
01:29:59,522 --> 01:30:02,233
有人告訴我納森回來了。他怎麼樣？
{\fs12}Somebody told me Nathan's back. How is he?{\r}

915
01:30:02,917 --> 01:30:06,913
帕金斯先生，你為什麼不拜訪他？他會告訴你他是怎麼回事。
{\fs12}Why don't you pay him a visit, Mr. Perkins? He'll tell you how he is.{\r}

916
01:30:07,276 --> 01:30:09,924
麗貝卡，我會那樣做的。我會這樣做的。
{\fs12}I'll do that, Rebecca. I'll do just that.{\r}

917
01:30:16,300 --> 01:30:18,573
那個老啄木鳥現在想要什麼？
{\fs12}What does that old peckerwood want now?{\r}

918
01:30:18,693 --> 01:30:20,203
好！
{\fs12}Well!{\r}

919
01:30:20,935 --> 01:30:23,028
他希望你拜訪他。
{\fs12}He wants you to pay him a visit.{\r}

920
01:30:27,147 --> 01:30:29,367
你們兩個可以坐在陰涼的樹下...
{\fs12}The two of you could sit under a shady tree...{\r}

921
01:30:29,487 --> 01:30:32,463
...喝冰冷的威士忌，拍攝微風！
{\fs12}...drink ice-cold whiskey, and shoot the breeze!{\r}

922
01:30:33,616 --> 01:30:37,625
嗯，我希望你告訴他我太忙了，不能那種東西。
{\fs12}Well, I hope you told him I was too busy for that kind of stuff.{\r}

923
01:30:43,165 --> 01:30:44,404
早安！
{\fs12}Good morning!{\r}

924
01:30:47,521 --> 01:30:48,696
MM-嗯。

是啊...

是的，現在，你們所做的一切都做得很好。
{\fs12}Yeah, now, y'all done did a good job with this crop.{\r}

 -好的，謝謝。 -嗯嗯。
{\fs12}-Well, thank you. -Mm-hmm.{\r}

928
01:30:59,251 --> 01:31:01,344
好吧，來吧，讓我們開始工作吧！
{\fs12}Well, come on, let's get to work!{\r}

929
01:31:01,464 --> 01:31:04,393
 -你確定你能做到嗎，納森？ -是的，我感覺到了！
{\fs12}-Are you sure you feel up to it, Nathan? -Yeah, I feel up to it!{\r}

930
01:31:04,513 --> 01:31:06,272
-為什麼不？ -好的。
{\fs12}-Why not? -Alright.{\r}

931
01:31:07,044 --> 01:31:08,223
來吧，騾子。
{\fs12}Come on, mule.{\r}

932
01:31:09,205 --> 01:31:11,057
嘿，快點！來吧，騾子。
{\fs12}Hey, come on! Come on, mule.{\r}

933
01:31:11,805 --> 01:31:12,808
繼續。
{\fs12}Go on.{\r}

934
01:31:30,609 --> 01:31:34,837
你知道，我很自豪你幫助你的媽媽保持這個地方的方式。
{\fs12}You know, I sure am proud of the way you helped your mama keep this place going.{\r}

935
01:31:34,957 --> 01:31:36,310
謝謝爸爸。
{\fs12}Thanks, Daddy.{\r}

936
01:31:42,951 --> 01:31:44,688
你知道，有些人，有些人...
{\fs12}You know, some people, some people...{\r}

937
01:31:44,808 --> 01:31:48,353
...可能認為這是一項艱苦的工作，但它肯定會在地獄中被打入監獄。
{\fs12}...may think this is hard work, but it sure in the hell beats going to jail.{\r}

938
01:31:49,586 --> 01:31:51,977
爸爸，你不會坐牢嗎？
{\fs12}You won't be going to jail, will you, Daddy?{\r}

939
01:31:52,097 --> 01:31:55,586
在我回到那個地方之前，他們必須殺了我。
{\fs12}They'd have to kill me before I'd go back to that place.{\r}

940
01:31:58,244 --> 01:31:59,291
來吧。
{\fs12}Come on.{\r}

941
01:32:00,273 --> 01:32:04,303
不是沒有人入獄，也不是沒有人受傷。
{\fs12}Ain't nobody going to jail, and ain't nobody getting hurt.{\r}

942
01:32:14,394 --> 01:32:17,180
現在，繼續給我一些更多的手杖。
{\fs12}Now, go on and get me some more of that cane.{\r}

943
01:32:27,262 --> 01:32:28,223
哦!
{\fs12}Oh!{\r}

944
01:32:28,343 --> 01:32:29,556
哇，騾子！
{\fs12}Whoa, mule!{\r}

945
01:32:29,676 --> 01:32:30,785
哇！哇！
{\fs12}Whoa! Whoa!{\r}

946
01:32:31,426 --> 01:32:32,451
爸爸！
{\fs12}Daddy!{\r}

947
01:32:32,571 --> 01:32:33,581
哇！哇，騾子！
{\fs12}Whoa! Whoa, mule!{\r}

948
01:32:33,701 --> 01:32:34,755
你好嗎，爸爸？
{\fs12}You alright, Daddy?{\r}

949
01:32:34,875 --> 01:32:37,211
我沒事，我沒事，只是...
{\fs12}I'm alright, I'm alright, just...{\r}

950
01:32:37,331 --> 01:32:39,880
該死的腿不會像過去那樣行事。
{\fs12}Damn leg just won't act like it used to.{\r}

951
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,278
納森，你確定沒事嗎？
{\fs12}You sure you're alright, Nathan?{\r}

952
01:32:42,398 --> 01:32:44,856
是的，我會沒事的，我只需...
{\fs12}Yeah, I'll be alright, I just have to...{\r}

953
01:32:46,564 --> 01:32:48,528
我只需休息一兩分鐘。
{\fs12}I just have to rest for a minute or two.{\r}

954
01:32:48,648 --> 01:32:52,678
 -在這裡，讓我幫忙。 -不，不，你只是...留在原地。
{\fs12}-Here, let me help. -No, no, you just...stay where you is.{\r}

955
01:33:06,818 --> 01:33:08,537
你覺得好嗎，爸爸？
{\fs12}You feel alright, Daddy?{\r}

956
01:33:09,519 --> 01:33:12,402
是的，我感覺很好。太棒了
{\fs12}Yeah, I feel great. Just great.{\r}

957
01:33:14,621 --> 01:33:16,187
那雙縫...
{\fs12}...that double seam...{\r}

958
01:33:16,307 --> 01:33:19,553
...當你放手時，只需將那根手指拉開，你就明白了嗎？
{\fs12}...and when you let it go, just zip off that finger there, you got it?{\r}

959
01:33:19,673 --> 01:33:22,805
 -是的-讓我們來看看。言歸正傳。是的，就是這樣。
{\fs12}-Yeah. -Let's see. Closer. Yeah, that's it.{\r}

960
01:33:22,925 --> 01:33:26,270
好的。拉鍊，就在這裡，就在本壘板上。
{\fs12}Alright. Zip it, right in here, right over home plate.{\r}

961
01:33:28,854 --> 01:33:30,444
 -嘿！ -罷工1！
{\fs12}-Hey! -Strike 1!{\r}

962
01:33:30,872 --> 01:33:32,345
噢，來吧，喬西梅。
{\fs12}Aw, come on, Josie Mae.{\r}

963
01:33:32,465 --> 01:33:34,860
嘿，艾克！你好嗎？
{\fs12}Hey, Ike! How you doing?{\r}

964
01:33:35,479 --> 01:33:39,494
任何時候是星期六，我沒有工作要做，我做得很好。
{\fs12}Anytime it's Saturday, and I ain't got no work to do, I'm doing fine.{\r}

965
01:33:40,775 --> 01:33:42,376
 -嘿，艾克。 -嗨！
{\fs12}-Hey, Ike. -Hi!{\r}

966
01:33:42,670 --> 01:33:44,378
嘿，你到底在那裡？
{\fs12}Hey, what you got there?{\r}

967
01:33:48,320 --> 01:33:51,213
看來這封郵件今天早上到了帕金斯先生的地方...
{\fs12}It seems this piece of mail's come this morning, over to Mr. Perkins' place...{\r}

968
01:33:51,333 --> 01:33:54,597
...而且，呃...他說讓我把它帶到這裡。
{\fs12}...and, uh...he said for me to bring it over here.{\r}

969
01:33:54,717 --> 01:33:56,200
 -好吧，把它放在這裡。 -嗯嗯。
{\fs12}-Well, give it here. -Mm-mmm.{\r}

970
01:33:56,320 --> 01:33:59,793
不適合你。這是在這裡的小重要人物。
{\fs12}Ain't for you. It's for the little important man over here.{\r}

971
01:34:01,003 --> 01:34:02,241
大衛李...
{\fs12}David Lee...{\r}

972
01:34:06,461 --> 01:34:09,985
嗯，兒子，你不打算把它打開並讀給我們嗎？
{\fs12}Well, son, ain't you going to open it up and read it to us?{\r}

973
01:34:14,046 --> 01:34:16,580
好的，我現在必須走了。星期天我會在教堂看到你們。
{\fs12}OK, I've got to go now. I'll see y'all in church on Sunday.{\r}

974
01:34:16,700 --> 01:34:18,651
 -嗯嗯。 -是的，艾克，謝謝你的麻煩。
{\fs12}-Mm-hmm. -Yeah, Ike, thank you for the trouble.{\r}

975
01:34:18,771 --> 01:34:20,195
現在，祝你有個美好的一天。
{\fs12}Have a good day, now.{\r}

976
01:34:20,665 --> 01:34:21,633
再見。
{\fs12}Bye.{\r}

977
01:34:30,109 --> 01:34:32,081
是誰，大衛李？
{\fs12}Who's it from, David Lee?{\r}

978
01:34:33,319 --> 01:34:35,305
這是來自約翰遜女士，爸爸。
{\fs12}It's from Ms. Johnson, Daddy.{\r}

979
01:34:35,425 --> 01:34:37,163
那麼，請閱讀給我們。
{\fs12}Well, read it to us.{\r}

980
01:34:40,267 --> 01:34:44,303
“如果你來這裡上學，一定要帶些暖和的衣服。”
{\fs12}"If you are coming to school here, be sure to bring some warm clothes."{\r}

981
01:34:44,423 --> 01:34:47,193
“學期將於9月8日開始...”
{\fs12}"The school term will begin September 8th..."{\r}

982
01:34:47,313 --> 01:34:52,147
“...在這個月的第4或第5天到達這裡對你有好處。”
{\fs12}"...and it would be good for you to be here by the 4th or 5th of the month."{\r}

983
01:34:52,267 --> 01:34:55,613
“我希望一切都很好，你會在這裡。”
{\fs12}"I do hope everything is fine and you will be here."{\r}

984
01:34:55,733 --> 01:34:57,727
“把你的'問候'給你的家人。”
{\fs12}"Give my 'hello' to your family."{\r}

985
01:34:57,847 --> 01:35:00,394
“真的，卡米爾約翰遜女士”
{\fs12}"Yours truly, Ms. Camille Johnson"{\r}

986
01:35:02,908 --> 01:35:05,203
9月4日，那有多遠？
{\fs12}September 4, how far away is that?{\r}

987
01:35:07,370 --> 01:35:08,694
約一周。
{\fs12}About a week.{\r}

988
01:35:08,814 --> 01:35:11,619
 -好吧，來吧，孩子們，我們走吧！ -你去哪？
{\fs12}-Well, come on, children, let's go! -Where you going?{\r}

989
01:35:11,739 --> 01:35:14,572
到小賣部，給這個男孩一些衣服！
{\fs12}To the commissary, to get this boy some clothes!{\r}

990
01:35:14,692 --> 01:35:17,284
事實上，我會??為每個人買點東西。
{\fs12}In fact, I'm going to get something for everybody.{\r}

991
01:35:17,404 --> 01:35:19,596
納森，你不能這樣做，我們欠帕金斯先生太多了...
{\fs12}Nathan, you can't do that, we owe Mr. Perkins too much...{\r}

992
01:35:19,716 --> 01:35:22,414
哦，別告訴我，我們欠老人帕金斯。
{\fs12}Oh, don't tell me what we owe old man Perkins.{\r}

993
01:35:22,534 --> 01:35:25,638
我會做到這一點，讓他擔心收集。
{\fs12}I'll do the owing, and let him worry about the collecting.{\r}

994
01:35:25,758 --> 01:35:28,051
來吧，大衛李。來吧，你沒聽見我嗎？
{\fs12}Come on, David Lee. Come on, didn't you hear me?{\r}

995
01:35:28,171 --> 01:35:32,616
但爸爸，你剛回到家。我想待在家裡，和你在一起。
{\fs12}But Daddy, you just got home. I want to stay home, and be with you.{\r}

996
01:35:32,736 --> 01:35:35,693
好吧，我也想和你在一起，但...
{\fs12}Well, I want to be with you too, but...{\r}

997
01:35:35,813 --> 01:35:40,569
...但這所學校對你有好處，比如，呃...

{\fs12}...but this school is something that's good for you, like, uh...{\r}

998
01:35:40,689 --> 01:35:42,615
...喜歡呼吸的好空氣。
{\fs12}...like good air to breathe.{\r}

999
01:35:43,127 --> 01:35:45,198
我希望你擁有它。
{\fs12}I want you to have it.{\r}

1000
01:35:45,318 --> 01:35:47,077
這就是它的方式。
{\fs12}And that's the way it's going to be.{\r}

1001
01:35:47,197 --> 01:35:49,308
但爸爸，誰會在現場幫助你？
{\fs12}But Daddy, who's going to help you in the field?{\r}

1002
01:35:49,428 --> 01:35:52,084
你的腿受傷了。你不能像以前那樣工作！
{\fs12}Your leg is hurt. You can't work like you used to!{\r}

1003
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:54,582
誰會幫助你在房子周圍？
{\fs12}Who's gonna help you around the house?{\r}

1004
01:35:56,429 --> 01:35:58,191
讓我告訴你一件事。
{\fs12}Let me tell you something.{\r}

1005
01:35:59,525 --> 01:36:02,225
如果我的兩條腿都被切斷了...
{\fs12}If I had both of my legs cut off...{\r}

1006
01:36:02,345 --> 01:36:05,642
...我可以在這個領域做更多的工作，而不是100年。
{\fs12}...I could do more work in that field than you could in 100 years.{\r}

1007
01:36:05,762 --> 01:36:07,632
我不會去，爸爸，我不會去.....
{\fs12}I won't go, Daddy, I just won't go...{\r}

1008
01:36:07,752 --> 01:36:10,976
等一下。你不告訴我你不會做什麼。我告訴你！
{\fs12}Wait just a minute. You don't tell me what you ain't gonna do. I tell you!{\r}

1009
01:36:11,096 --> 01:36:13,924
如果我說你要去那所學校就要去。現在來吧，我不...
{\fs12}And if I say you're going to that school you're going. Now come on, I don't...{\r}

1010
01:36:14,044 --> 01:36:16,785
...想要聽到更多關於你的消息。大衛李！大衛李，回到這裡！

{\fs12}...wanna hear nothing more out of you. David Lee! David Lee, come back here!{\r}

1011
01:36:16,905 --> 01:36:17,874
納森！
{\fs12}Nathan!{\r}

1012
01:36:20,248 --> 01:36:22,426
請。離開他吧。
{\fs12}Please. Leave him be.{\r}

1013
01:36:24,433 --> 01:36:27,316
你走後，他很想念你。
{\fs12}He missed you a great bit whilst you were gone.{\r}

1014
01:36:27,764 --> 01:36:32,734
他大汗淋漓，擔心找到你所在的地方並做了那麼長的旅程。

{\fs12}He sweated and worried to find out just where you were & made that long journey.{\r}

1015
01:36:33,438 --> 01:36:37,983
你回家了，現在和他在一起是很自然的事。
{\fs12}You're home, and...it's only a natural thing for him to wanna be with you now.{\r}

1016
01:36:46,408 --> 01:36:47,391
大衛！
{\fs12}David!{\r}

1017
01:36:51,534 --> 01:36:52,986
大衛李！
{\fs12}David Lee!{\r}

1018
01:36:59,135 --> 01:37:00,352
大衛李！
{\fs12}David Lee!{\r}

1019
01:37:02,999 --> 01:37:04,302
大衛李！
{\fs12}David Lee!{\r}

1020
01:37:14,890 --> 01:37:15,979
大衛！
{\fs12}David!{\r}

1021
01:37:23,063 --> 01:37:24,451
大衛！
{\fs12}David!{\r}

1022
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:34,851
大衛李！
{\fs12}David Lee!{\r}

1023
01:37:38,054 --> 01:37:39,271
大衛！
{\fs12}David!{\r}

1024
01:37:53,756 --> 01:37:55,016
大衛李！
{\fs12}David Lee!{\r}

1025
01:38:33,205 --> 01:38:35,468
兒子，我可以和你談談嗎？
{\fs12}Can I talk to you for a minute, son?{\r}

1026
01:38:56,435 --> 01:38:58,805
你知道，當我受傷這條腿時...
{\fs12}You know, when I got this leg hurt...{\r}

1027
01:38:59,467 --> 01:39:01,754
...我在這個採石場裡倒下了...
{\fs12}...I was down in this rock quarry...{\r}

1028
01:39:02,202 --> 01:39:06,067
...突然之間有一陣炸藥爆炸...
{\fs12}...and all of a sudden there was this dynamite blast coming at me...{\r}

1029
01:39:06,187 --> 01:39:08,864
...用那種殺死10個人的力量。
{\fs12}...with the kind of force to kill 10 men.{\r}

1030
01:39:10,140 --> 01:39:11,315
好吧，我...
{\fs12}Well, so I...{\r}

1031
01:39:11,656 --> 01:39:13,407
我找到了大部分岩石的方式...
{\fs12}I got out the way of most of them rocks...{\r}

1032
01:39:13,527 --> 01:39:15,621
...比上帝心中的閃電更快，因為...
{\fs12}...faster than the lightning in God's mind, cause...{\r}

1033
01:39:15,741 --> 01:39:20,563
...我在腦海裡彌補了這一點，就這麼快...
{\fs12}...I made it up in my head, just that quick...{\r}

1034
01:39:20,683 --> 01:39:24,086
...我要擊敗正在向我走來的死亡。
{\fs12}...that I was gonna beat the death that was coming at me.{\r}

1035
01:39:25,448 --> 01:39:29,142
好吧，這就是我要用腿上的麻煩來做的事情。
{\fs12}Well, that's what I'm going to do with this trouble in my leg.{\r}

1036
01:39:29,676 --> 01:39:31,064
我要打敗它。
{\fs12}I'm gonna beat it.{\r}

1037
01:39:32,665 --> 01:39:35,633
除了擊敗它之外，我不能做任何事情。
{\fs12}Ain't nothing left for me to do but to beat it.{\r}

1038
01:39:37,790 --> 01:39:39,945
但這就是我想要你做的。
{\fs12}But that's what I want you to do.{\r}

1039
01:39:40,564 --> 01:39:44,461
我希望你能在這個地方擊敗他們為你準備的生活，因為...
{\fs12}I want you to beat the life they got all laid out for you in this place, cause...{\r}

1040
01:39:44,581 --> 01:39:49,088
這裡沒有什麼，這裡不是沒有人，但是他們發給我的混蛋...
{\fs12}There ain't nothing here, ain't nobody here but them bastards that sent me...{\r}

1041
01:39:54,674 --> 01:39:57,215
兒子，不要太習慣這個地方。
{\fs12}Son, don't get too used to this place.{\r}

1042
01:39:58,133 --> 01:40:02,002
因為無論你在哪裡，我都會愛你。我的意思是，我...
{\fs12}Cause wherever you is, I'm gonna love you. I mean, me...{\r}

1043
01:40:02,122 --> 01:40:05,579

{\fs12}...your mama, Josie Mae, and Earl... we're gonna love you even more.{\r}

1044
01:40:05,699 --> 01:40:09,687
為什麼，我們每次機會都會來到那所學校。
{\fs12}Why, we're gonna come and see you at that school every chance we get.{\r}

1045
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:16,925
我愛你，兒子。
{\fs12}I love you, son.{\r}

1046
01:40:20,214 --> 01:40:22,690
永遠不要以為我不愛你。
{\fs12}Don't ever think that I don't love you.{\r}

1047
01:40:34,290 --> 01:40:36,809
你認為我們會成為朋友嗎？
{\fs12}You think we're gonna get to be friends?{\r}

1048
01:40:58,934 --> 01:40:59,907
男孩...
{\fs12}Boy...{\r}

1049
01:41:39,930 --> 01:41:42,118
好的。請繼續前進，包包男孩。
{\fs12}Alright. Get a move on, bag boy.{\r}

1050
01:41:43,074 --> 01:41:44,445
你帶著自己的包！
{\fs12}You carry your own bag!{\r}

1051
01:41:44,565 --> 01:41:45,869
我會隨身攜帶它。
{\fs12}I'll carry it.{\r}

1052
01:41:46,617 --> 01:41:47,898
不，我會的。
{\fs12}Naw, I will.{\r}

1053
01:41:49,200 --> 01:41:50,668
謝謝，喬西梅。
{\fs12}Thanks, Josie Mae.{\r}

01:42:06,997 --> 01:42:09,121
好吧，現在，你很好。
{\fs12}Alright, now, you be good.{\r}

1055
01:42:09,703 --> 01:42:12,244
而你是聰明的年輕人。好？
{\fs12}And you be smart, young man. OK?{\r}

1056
01:42:25,517 --> 01:42:27,973
我明天晚上應該回來。
{\fs12}I ought to be back tomorrow evening.{\r}

1057
01:42:28,093 --> 01:42:30,330
 -小心，現在。  - Giddyup，騾子！
{\fs12}-Careful, now. -Giddyup, mule!{\r}

1058
01:42:35,732 --> 01:42:36,757
再見。
{\fs12}Bye.{\r}

1059
01:42:48,541 --> 01:42:50,335
你知道嗎，爸爸？
{\fs12}You know something, Daddy?{\r}

1060
01:42:50,455 --> 01:42:51,915
那是什麼，兒子？
{\fs12}What's that, son?{\r}

1061
01:42:52,278 --> 01:42:55,075
我會想念這個破舊不堪的地方...
{\fs12}I'm gonna miss this old raggedy place...{\r}

1062
01:42:56,922 --> 01:42:59,548
...但我肯定不會擔心它。
{\fs12}...but I sure ain't gonna worry about it.{\r}

1063
01:43:01,124 --> 01:43:02,170
嘿!
{\fs12}Hey!{\r}

1064
01:43:05,560 --> 01:43:06,542
嘿!
{\fs12}Hey!{\r}

1065
01:43:10,183 --> 01:43:13,215
男孩，你看到我在三壘牽制他了嗎？
{\fs12}Boy, did you see me pick him off at 3rd base?{\r}

1066
01:43:14,325 --> 01:43:17,806
我告訴你，我的快速球讓他們都站起來看！
{\fs12}I tell you, my speedball makes them all stand up and look!{\r}

1067
01:43:24,243 --> 01:43:28,737
如果我真的想，真的可以在大聯盟中取得成功
{\fs12}I think I really could have made it in the big leagues, if I really wanted to.{\r}

1068
01:43:29,032 --> 01:43:30,003
嘿!
{\fs12}Hey!{\r}
