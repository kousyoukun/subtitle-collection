1
00:01:22,729 --> 00:01:23,991
Welcome to Miami.

2
00:01:24,197 --> 00:01:27,564
While in the airport, please
observe Florida and local laws...

3
00:01:27,768 --> 00:01:30,236
...which prohibit smoking
in the terminal.

4
00:01:30,437 --> 00:01:32,735
Thank you for not smoking.

5
00:02:51,318 --> 00:02:54,253
Your son-in-law deaIt with the
dry cleaning franchise during the day.

6
00:02:54,454 --> 00:02:56,615
He saw that woman every night.

7
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:02,689
The specifics are in my report,
and information about the woman.

8
00:03:04,464 --> 00:03:06,295
It's unpleasant, I know.

9
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,827
Discreet, isn't he?

10
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,998
What an imbecile!

11
00:03:11,404 --> 00:03:13,304
I tried to warn my daughter...

12
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:14,598
...but what can you do?

13
00:03:14,808 --> 00:03:17,641
I worry about the children.

14
00:03:17,878 --> 00:03:20,142
My invoice is in the envelope,
if that's all.

15
00:03:20,714 --> 00:03:22,909
Yes, Mr. Welles. Thank you.

16
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:26,983
Let me know if I can be of
further assistance to you, Senator.

17
00:03:27,187 --> 00:03:28,779
I値l be in touch.

18
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:07,758
Hello?

19
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:09,752
You're home.

20
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:12,122
We're back here.

21
00:04:13,366 --> 00:04:14,230
How did it go?

22
00:04:14,434 --> 00:04:15,526
I think very well.

23
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:16,995
Good.

24
00:04:17,237 --> 00:04:19,205
Daddy's home, sweetie.

25
00:04:20,373 --> 00:04:22,500
How's the textbook business?

26
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,868
I got 1 0,000 words on
the federal theatre project.

27
00:04:27,113 --> 00:04:30,549
It Should be 4,000 and the writer
doesn't want to change anything.

28
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,081
So kind of bad.

29
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:35,077
How was Miami?

30
00:04:35,322 --> 00:04:36,789
Fine. Lonesome.

31
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:38,981
Couldn稚 pay me enough
to live down there.

32
00:04:39,326 --> 00:04:40,884
Then why'd you go?

33
00:04:41,328 --> 00:04:44,491
Senator Michaelson has
powerful friends.

34
00:04:50,236 --> 00:04:52,329
Hello, Cinderella.

35
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:55,134
Did you miss me?
I sure missed you.

36
00:04:55,342 --> 00:04:56,900
-She missed you.
-That's my girl.

37
00:04:57,110 --> 00:04:59,510
She missed you.
I missed you.

38
00:05:01,114 --> 00:05:02,240
You been smoking?

39
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:05,444
Smoking? I'm not smoking.

40
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,483
Come on, honey.

41
00:05:09,122 --> 00:05:10,680
You reek of it.

42
00:05:11,424 --> 00:05:14,291
Amy, I've been sitting around
in bars following this guy.

43
00:05:14,494 --> 00:05:16,428
Is this the first thing I get?

44
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:19,325
-You're accusing me?
-I'm not accusing you.

45
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,268
I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been all through that.

46
00:05:24,337 --> 00:05:26,498
I値l make dinner.
Are you hungry?

47
00:05:26,773 --> 00:05:27,740
You're cooking?

48
00:05:32,212 --> 00:05:33,543
I missed you.

49
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:42,085
I don't like it when you leave.

50
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,293
Should I go?

51
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,395
I'm going to do it.

52
00:06:02,008 --> 00:06:03,339
Come on.

53
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:06,376
What's all the trouble, Cinderella?

54
00:06:07,047 --> 00:06:08,708
There, there.

55
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:19,091
I love you.

56
00:06:22,495 --> 00:06:23,894
I love you.

57
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,638
Honey, phone!

58
00:06:48,455 --> 00:06:50,013
Okay, I've got it!

59
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,952
Sorry, I was just switching phones.

60
00:06:56,930 --> 00:06:59,296
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Longdale.

61
00:06:59,499 --> 00:07:01,626
How can I be of assistance to you?

62
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,974
Four o団lock would be fine.

63
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:15,080
I think I know where it is.

64
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:58,750
Mr. Welles, Daniel Longdale.
We spoke on the phone.

65
00:07:58,958 --> 00:07:59,788
Pleasure.

66
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:03,087
I'm the Christians' attorney and
one of the executors of the estate.

67
00:08:03,296 --> 00:08:04,422
This is Mrs. Christian.

68
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:06,360
It's an honour to meet you, ma'am.

69
00:08:06,633 --> 00:08:09,101
You come highly recommended,
Mr. Welles.

70
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:13,261
I've spoken to associates of mine in
Harrisburg and Lancaster and Hershey.

71
00:08:13,473 --> 00:08:15,100
You have influentual friends.

72
00:08:15,308 --> 00:08:18,277
I've been privileged to provide
services for people I admire.

73
00:08:18,478 --> 00:08:20,969
You were praised
for your discretion...

74
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:24,514
...your strict adherence
to confidentiality.

75
00:08:24,751 --> 00:08:25,649
Thank you, ma'am.

76
00:08:28,888 --> 00:08:31,948
As you know,
my husband passed away recently.

77
00:08:32,192 --> 00:08:34,456
My condolences, Mrs. Christian.

78
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:38,219
His passing has left me...

79
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:39,955
...with a dilemma.

80
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,259
I値l do whatever I can to help.

81
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,602
My husband's inner sanctum.

82
00:08:45,805 --> 00:08:48,296
Not many people have been
inside this room.

83
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:52,841
My father worked the Pittsburgh mill.

84
00:08:53,046 --> 00:08:55,310
Irving United Steel, I believe.

85
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:58,016
But you attended Penn
on an academic scholarship.

86
00:08:58,251 --> 00:08:59,309
That's right.

87
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,986
Peers went into law and finance,
but you chose surveillance.

88
00:09:02,222 --> 00:09:04,087
I decided it was the future.

89
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:05,957
Your husband is a legend.

90
00:09:06,292 --> 00:09:07,259
Please.

91
00:09:07,493 --> 00:09:10,053
We were married 45 years.

92
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:13,562
Four children, seven grandchildren.

93
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,762
But his true passion lay...

94
00:09:15,969 --> 00:09:17,231
...in his work.

95
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,335
But he was always loyal.

96
00:09:19,539 --> 00:09:21,029
I loved him...

97
00:09:21,474 --> 00:09:22,600
...deeply.

98
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:24,466
I understand.

99
00:09:26,813 --> 00:09:28,178
Daniel.

100
00:09:28,948 --> 00:09:32,611
My husband was the only one with
the combination to this safe.

101
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:34,477
We had to hire somebody to open it.

102
00:09:34,921 --> 00:09:36,946
I prevented anyone...

103
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,385
...from seeing the contents.

104
00:09:39,592 --> 00:09:42,686
I feIt these were
my husband's private things.

105
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:43,987
I didn't....

106
00:09:45,798 --> 00:09:47,823
I didn't realize....

107
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:51,067
Do you want to tell me
what you found?

108
00:09:53,673 --> 00:09:55,698
Cash, stock certificates.

109
00:09:55,942 --> 00:10:00,208
Nothing out of the ordinary,
really, except that.

110
00:10:02,081 --> 00:10:03,241
It's a film...

111
00:10:05,451 --> 00:10:07,578
...where a girl appears to be murdered.

112
00:10:07,820 --> 00:10:09,549
I'm not sure I understand.

113
00:10:09,756 --> 00:10:11,417
It's very realistic.

114
00:10:11,658 --> 00:10:14,957
But how many people seem to be
realistically killed...

115
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:16,958
...in movies and on TV every day?

116
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,425
It begins as a relatively
sleazy bit of pornography...

117
00:10:21,668 --> 00:10:24,660
...and rapidly turns
quite violent and bloody.

118
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:32,772
What you're talking about
is called a snuff film.

119
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:35,310
From what I know,
snuff films are an urban myth.

120
00:10:36,049 --> 00:10:38,916
Sex industry folklore.
There's no such thing.

121
00:10:39,118 --> 00:10:40,983
That's what I explained
to Mrs. Christian.

122
00:10:41,254 --> 00:10:43,688
This is probably
an S & M film of some sort.

123
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,915
Simulated rape, simulated violence.

124
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,389
It's hard to stomach,
but there are ways of doing it.

125
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:50,221
Fake blood, special effects.

126
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,593
Would you look at the film
and give us your opinion?

127
00:10:54,267 --> 00:10:55,461
All I want...

128
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:59,900
...is to know that
this atrocity is false.

129
00:11:00,506 --> 00:11:02,167
I want the proof.

130
00:12:57,523 --> 00:12:58,421
Well...

131
00:12:58,624 --> 00:13:01,684
...whoever made the film was adept
at authenticity.


132
00:13:01,894 --> 00:13:05,591
But I'm no expert. I suggest letting
the police make a determination.

133
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:06,696
Out of the question.

134
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,663
That would be so unnecessary
for any number of reasons...

135
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:13,100
...not the least of which is
Mr. Christian's reputation.

136
00:13:14,674 --> 00:13:16,642
We want you to find out
who made this film...

137
00:13:16,843 --> 00:13:18,640
...and establish whether it's real.

138
00:13:19,045 --> 00:13:20,444
You can name your price.

139
00:13:20,646 --> 00:13:24,480
You値l be provided with whatever
you need to buy information.

140
00:13:26,819 --> 00:13:28,787
Girl痴 all I've got to go on.

141
00:13:29,021 --> 00:13:30,818
I could treat it
like a missing persons case.

142
00:13:31,023 --> 00:13:31,955
Understood.

143
00:13:32,158 --> 00:13:33,216
Of course...

144
00:13:33,426 --> 00:13:37,157
...we need to be assured
that you would not copy this film.

145
00:13:37,363 --> 00:13:39,194
You have my word on that.

146
00:13:39,599 --> 00:13:41,658
But I値l be dealing
directly with you...

147
00:13:41,868 --> 00:13:42,800
...and only you.

148
00:13:43,035 --> 00:13:44,935
Your relationship with
your attorney is your own.

149
00:13:45,204 --> 00:13:47,104
-No offence.
-None taken.

150
00:13:47,306 --> 00:13:50,605
I realize you've given this
careful consideration.

151
00:13:52,378 --> 00:13:53,538
You could have destroyed it.

152
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:56,374
Tell me the poor girl wasn't killed.

153
00:13:56,616 --> 00:13:57,913
Please?

154
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:00,051
Find her alive.

155
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:02,312
I値l do the best I can, ma'am.

156
00:14:43,829 --> 00:14:44,659
Cleveland?

157
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:45,863
You just got home.

158
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:48,862
And I wish I could stay,
but this is the mortgage.

159
00:14:49,101 --> 00:14:50,568
It's Cindy's college money.

160
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:53,068
If I do right by her,
with the circle she runs in...

161
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:54,705
...this could be a big break.

162
00:14:54,941 --> 00:14:56,374
I didn't know we needed a break.

163
00:14:56,609 --> 00:14:58,577
Your father seems to think we do.

164
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:04,375
So, what was Mrs. Christian like?

165
00:15:04,617 --> 00:15:08,053
Like you'd expect, I guess.
I feel sorry for her.

166
00:15:08,354 --> 00:15:09,343
It's a missing persons.

167
00:15:09,589 --> 00:15:12,319
I told her I'd give it
a couple, three weeks.

168
00:15:12,992 --> 00:15:16,018
It can't take longer than that.
It's an outside shot.

169
00:15:16,262 --> 00:15:20,358
That's all I can tell you. Sometimes
you can't know what I'm doing.

170
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,863
It's always that way.

171
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:25,601
She's awake. I値l get her.

172
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:27,602
All right, I値l be up in a sec.

173
00:15:56,502 --> 00:15:58,629
-You're taking the gun?
-I won't need it.

174
00:15:58,838 --> 00:15:59,668
Don't take it.

175
00:15:59,872 --> 00:16:01,533
I won't wear it.
It's just a precaution.

176
00:16:01,774 --> 00:16:02,638
Don't worry.

177
00:16:02,842 --> 00:16:05,436
Will you call me
when you get there, please?

178
00:16:21,227 --> 00:16:25,391
I致e been hired by a couple in
Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.

179
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:28,897
A few days ago, they picked up
a girl hitchhiking off 81...

180
00:16:29,101 --> 00:16:31,194
...a runaway, about 18, maybe.

181
00:16:31,404 --> 00:16:32,735
They buy her a meal.

182
00:16:32,938 --> 00:16:35,236
The doctor tries to convince her...

183
00:16:35,441 --> 00:16:37,671
...that, at the very least,
she should call home.

184
00:16:37,877 --> 00:16:40,471
Not surprisingly, the girl ate,
excused herself...

185
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,341
...that was the last they saw of her.

186
00:16:42,581 --> 00:16:45,709
We had a friend of mine at
the department work up a sketch.

187
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:48,145
They want to see
if I can ID this girl...

188
00:16:48,387 --> 00:16:50,582
...then pass along
a message to the parents...

189
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:52,883
...letting them know
the kid's alive.

190
00:16:54,126 --> 00:16:55,889
You don't mind if I run a check?

191
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:57,459
Go ahead.

192
00:16:58,397 --> 00:16:59,489
You want it, you got it.

193
00:16:59,732 --> 00:17:00,858
Knock yourself out.

194
00:17:01,067 --> 00:17:04,468
Anywhere from 850,000 to 1 ,000,000
missing every year.

195
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:08,162
We have as much as we can on computer,
then it's the wet-thumb method.

196
00:17:08,374 --> 00:17:10,239
Files are by state and year
of disappearance.

197
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:12,035
We keep children
and aduIts separate.

198
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:13,609
No eating or smoking.

199
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,507
-The coffee machine's in the hall.
-Any good?

200
00:17:15,748 --> 00:17:16,874
Horrible.

201
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:19,084
It値l be your best friend
after a few days...

202
00:17:19,285 --> 00:17:20,843
...if you last that long.

203
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,314
Good luck.

204
00:17:26,225 --> 00:17:27,556
Honey, it's me.

205
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:28,624
How are you?

206
00:17:28,828 --> 00:17:29,920
I知 good.

207
00:17:30,129 --> 00:17:31,118
Where are you?

208
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:34,265
I知 still in Cleveland.
How's Cindy?

209
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:37,300
She's sweet.
She's sleeping.

210
00:17:37,903 --> 00:17:39,336
I知 missing you bigtime.

211
00:17:39,572 --> 00:17:41,233
Yeah, l miss you too.

212
00:17:42,908 --> 00:17:44,136
I値l call you tomorrow.

213
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,038
Okay. Good night.

214
00:17:46,312 --> 00:17:47,939
Good night, sweetheart.

215
00:18:32,158 --> 00:18:34,285
Hello, Mrs. Christian?
Tom Welles.

216
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:35,721
Here's where we stand.

217
00:18:35,961 --> 00:18:39,419
l checked the film stock.
It痴 called Supralux 544.

218
00:18:39,632 --> 00:18:43,261
The company that made that
stock discontinued it in '92.

219
00:18:43,469 --> 00:18:45,869
So the film was made prior to that.

220
00:18:46,071 --> 00:18:48,869
I'm probably being overly
thorough with this...

221
00:18:49,074 --> 00:18:52,305
...but you might want to dig up your
husband's financial records...

222
00:18:52,511 --> 00:18:54,172
...about 6 or 7 years ago.

223
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:57,110
See if there's anything
out of the ordinary.

224
00:18:57,349 --> 00:19:00,876
Obviously, this isn't a movie
you drop off at the one-hour photo.

225
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,951
So you think it's one of a kind.

226
00:19:03,155 --> 00:19:06,591
The film that went through the camera
is what we've got. There's no negative.

227
00:19:07,193 --> 00:19:09,957
Unlike video, it's not really
designed to be duplicated.

228
00:19:10,162 --> 00:19:12,323
Whatever this is,
l have a feeling...

229
00:19:12,531 --> 00:19:15,432
...there aren't many copies
floating around, if any.

230
00:19:15,634 --> 00:19:19,365
I知 looking for a girl we're
not sure is missing.

231
00:19:19,572 --> 00:19:22,268
With this happening 6 or 7 years ago...

232
00:19:22,475 --> 00:19:24,340
...finding the guys
who made this film...

233
00:19:24,543 --> 00:19:26,773
...frankly, is going
to be very difficuIt.

234
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:30,073
l know you can do it.
You're doing a wonderful job.

235
00:19:30,349 --> 00:19:33,477
Please tell me you'll
continue the investigation.

236
00:19:33,719 --> 00:19:35,744
l will. I値l keep trying for you.

237
00:19:36,021 --> 00:19:38,489
You can count on me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.

238
00:19:39,925 --> 00:19:44,225
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave a message at the beep.

239
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:45,522
Honey, it's me.

240
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:48,723
I'm sorry I forgot
to call last night.

241
00:19:48,934 --> 00:19:50,595
I won't forget tonight.

242
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:53,704
I've been gone a long time
and I hope I値l be home soon.

243
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:56,807
I love you, and I miss you.
We値l talk tonight.

244
00:21:19,024 --> 00:21:20,992
You looking for Janet?

245
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:29,592
Hello, Mrs. Mathews?

246
00:21:29,802 --> 00:21:32,362
I'm Thomas Hart.
I'm a state-licensed investigator.

247
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:36,130
I've been hired by the U.S.
Resource Centre, Missing Persons...

248
00:21:36,342 --> 00:21:37,900
...as part of an internal audit.

249
00:21:38,143 --> 00:21:40,008
I'd like to make an appointment
with you...

250
00:21:40,212 --> 00:21:43,340
...to answer questions
about your daughter, Mary Anne.

251
00:21:43,582 --> 00:21:47,780
I spoke to your FBI contact
yesterday, Agent....

252
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,510
Neil. Neil Cole?

253
00:21:49,755 --> 00:21:54,089
Yes, Agent Cole. He told me he'd call
and let you know to expect me.

254
00:21:54,793 --> 00:21:56,124
He didn't call?

255
00:22:02,801 --> 00:22:03,631
Is this you?

256
00:22:05,804 --> 00:22:07,863
You look about five years old.

257
00:22:08,307 --> 00:22:09,205
A little older.

258
00:22:09,408 --> 00:22:10,636
Sweet.

259
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:15,543
It's important that...

260
00:22:15,748 --> 00:22:19,081
...you don't let this raise
your expectations.

261
00:22:19,351 --> 00:22:22,616
It's not going to effect
any ongoing efforts.

262
00:22:23,355 --> 00:22:25,414
All I'm saying is, please know that...

263
00:22:25,624 --> 00:22:28,388
...I'm not here to create
any false hope.

264
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:35,360
We fought all the time,
Mary Anne and me...

265
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:36,795
...and her stepdad.

266
00:22:37,036 --> 00:22:38,697
She hated him...

267
00:22:38,971 --> 00:22:41,064
...because he wasn't her real dad.

268
00:22:41,707 --> 00:22:44,733
Trouble here, trouble at school.

269
00:22:44,943 --> 00:22:46,069
Trouble.

270
00:22:46,612 --> 00:22:50,207
Didn't like rules.
Takes after me, I guess.

271
00:22:50,516 --> 00:22:52,746
I had to learn the hard way.

272
00:22:54,353 --> 00:22:56,116
Can I speak to your husband?

273
00:22:56,321 --> 00:22:57,288
Her stepfather?

274
00:22:57,489 --> 00:22:58,615
Dave?

275
00:22:58,824 --> 00:23:00,155
Gone.

276
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:02,858
Two years after Mary Anne left.

277
00:23:03,295 --> 00:23:06,321
All the time, she resented him.

278
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:10,366
I lost her because of him,
and then I lost him.

279
00:23:10,936 --> 00:23:13,131
I'm the only one still here.

280
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,440
Did Mary have a boyfriend?

281
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:19,236
She was sneaking out with someone.

282
00:23:19,645 --> 00:23:21,579
She wouldn't tell me who.

283
00:23:21,914 --> 00:23:25,247
Coming home with hickeys,
lying all the time.

284
00:23:26,952 --> 00:23:30,388
I am sorry to bring this up,
but in these circumstances...

285
00:23:30,622 --> 00:23:32,317
...with the stepfather....

286
00:23:32,524 --> 00:23:35,721
Were there any indications
of any sort of abuse?

287
00:23:35,928 --> 00:23:38,920
There was nothing like that.
The police and FBI asked.

288
00:23:39,131 --> 00:23:41,099
Nothing happened like that.
Never.

289
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,494
She'd have told me.

290
00:23:42,701 --> 00:23:45,261
I apologize. I had to ask.

291
00:23:46,472 --> 00:23:50,875
Those are for her birthday.
One for every year she missed.

292
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:53,806
They値l be waiting for her
when she comes back.

293
00:23:55,848 --> 00:23:57,839
It's because I slapped her.

294
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:00,711
I know.

295
00:24:02,454 --> 00:24:06,754
We was fighting about Dave,
and she was just pushing my buttons.

296
00:24:06,959 --> 00:24:08,358
And I slapped her.

297
00:24:10,262 --> 00:24:11,490
Jesus.

298
00:24:12,931 --> 00:24:14,330
Next day, she was gone.

299
00:24:15,501 --> 00:24:18,334
When kids run, they almost
always leave a note.

300
00:24:18,537 --> 00:24:19,731
It's guiIt, usually.

301
00:24:19,938 --> 00:24:21,599
There wasn't one.

302
00:24:21,974 --> 00:24:23,134
Police looked.

303
00:24:23,342 --> 00:24:25,936
An abduction's one thing,
a runaway's another.

304
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:29,512
Sometimes it's not the priority
for the police it Should be.

305
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:33,945
There wasn't anything.
Don't you think I wish there was?

306
00:24:34,286 --> 00:24:36,846
You're probably right,
but would you let me look?

307
00:24:38,657 --> 00:24:40,284
You tell me...

308
00:24:40,492 --> 00:24:42,653
...not to get my hopes up...

309
00:24:43,228 --> 00:24:46,220
...not to raise my expectations.

310
00:24:50,235 --> 00:24:51,600
Go ahead.

311
00:24:52,271 --> 00:24:53,670
I need a drink.

312
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:56,169
Thank you.

313
00:26:44,616 --> 00:26:46,447
Dear Mom: lf you're reading this...

314
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:49,678
...it probably means l called you
from Hollywood, California.

315
00:26:49,955 --> 00:26:54,085
l left my diary behind because
l want you to see why I知 leaving.

316
00:26:54,293 --> 00:26:55,954
It痴 not because you hit me.

317
00:26:56,194 --> 00:26:59,322
l hid this so Dave the dickhead
wouldn't find it.

318
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:01,633
Warren Anderson and me
are in love.

319
00:27:01,833 --> 00:27:04,097
I知 going to start
a whole new life with him.

320
00:27:04,303 --> 00:27:06,271
Warren's dad owns
that garage in town.

321
00:27:06,471 --> 00:27:09,338
But Warren has even bigger plans.


322
00:27:09,541 --> 00:27:11,532
Warren'll become a star
in action movies.

323
00:27:11,777 --> 00:27:14,541
He says I知 prettier
than a lot of girls in movies.

324
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:16,111
l could be a star too.

325
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:17,947
You want a drink?

326
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,017
When we cruise into Hollywood...

327
00:27:20,218 --> 00:27:24,848
...I値l have fiery eyes that everyone
will notice, because l am in love.

328
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:29,889
You were right.
I didn't find anything.

329
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:32,123
Fixed you a drink.

330
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:34,765
Thanks, no.
I've got work to do.

331
00:27:35,000 --> 00:27:36,865
I値l stop by tomorrow night.

332
00:27:37,836 --> 00:27:40,430
We'll probably be married
by the time you read this.

333
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:44,172
Don't come looking for me,
because I知 not coming back.

334
00:27:44,409 --> 00:27:48,106
Maybe someday you'll see me
on TV or in magazines.

335
00:27:48,347 --> 00:27:51,544
Don't worry about me.
Love, Mary Anne.

336
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,577
Mr. Anderson?

337
00:27:55,887 --> 00:27:56,854
Who's asking?

338
00:27:57,055 --> 00:27:59,888
Tom Hart.
Excuse me not shaking hands.

339
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,924
I'm looking for your son.
You've got a son named Warren, right?

340
00:28:04,162 --> 00:28:05,356
Sure.

341
00:28:06,365 --> 00:28:07,730
What's it about?

342
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,096
You a cop?

343
00:28:09,301 --> 00:28:10,290
No, sir.

344
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:14,063
Just a friend from a while back.
Owe him some money, actually.

345
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:16,503
You owe him money?

346
00:28:16,742 --> 00:28:18,141
That's a new one.

347
00:28:20,045 --> 00:28:22,445
You can leave it
right here if you want.

348
00:28:23,248 --> 00:28:26,012
If it's all the same,
I'd like to send it to him.

349
00:28:26,485 --> 00:28:28,009
California, right?


350
00:28:29,721 --> 00:28:31,279
California?

351
00:28:32,624 --> 00:28:35,889
Son, you know where
the Fayetteville lockup is?

352
00:28:36,328 --> 00:28:38,387
That's where Warren is.

353
00:28:38,597 --> 00:28:41,088
Doing eight months on a B and E.

354
00:28:44,403 --> 00:28:45,563
Thank you.

355
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,074
Yeah, man, I knew her.

356
00:28:52,310 --> 00:28:54,938
Dumped that bitch right
before I moved to L.A.

357
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:58,406
She shows up knocking at my door
like a fucking stalker.

358
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,009
Told that bitch she could go to hell.

359
00:29:03,155 --> 00:29:04,383
Where'd she go?

360
00:29:06,291 --> 00:29:07,883
Hell, maybe.

361
00:29:08,894 --> 00:29:11,624
I don't know and
I don't give a fuck either.

362
00:29:13,331 --> 00:29:16,095
She said she might work
at a titty bar or something.

363
00:29:16,835 --> 00:29:19,167
Ask me, her tits
weren't all that great.

364
00:29:21,073 --> 00:29:22,665
Did you hear from her again?

365
00:29:24,976 --> 00:29:28,036
Just because I was fucking her
doesn't mean I wanted her out there.

366
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,913
She came to Hollywood to be
a big fucking movie star.

367
00:29:32,484 --> 00:29:33,849
And so did I.

368
00:29:34,219 --> 00:29:35,186
Check me out now.

369
00:29:39,691 --> 00:29:42,558
Why don't you
pass me one of them smokes?

370
00:29:49,301 --> 00:29:50,700
I don't smoke.

371

00:29:55,307 --> 00:29:56,569
How you doing?

372
00:29:56,808 --> 00:29:57,866
I知 okay.

373
00:29:58,076 --> 00:29:59,873
You don't sound okay.

374
00:30:00,312 --> 00:30:02,109
It's not easy.

375
00:30:02,314 --> 00:30:03,611
Why? What's going on?

376
00:30:03,849 --> 00:30:06,613
It's tougher than I thought
it would be, that's all.

377
00:30:06,852 --> 00:30:08,080
Is it getting to you?

378
00:30:08,353 --> 00:30:09,980
l got a lead l can't drop.

379
00:30:10,222 --> 00:30:12,213
I'm almost done.
I miss you.

380
00:30:12,557 --> 00:30:13,990
I miss you too.
I love you.

381
00:30:14,192 --> 00:30:15,784
Give Cindy a kiss for me, okay?

382
00:30:16,027 --> 00:30:19,292
Wait, I think she wants to say bye.
Say bye to Daddy.

383
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:20,998
Hi, sweetie.

384
00:30:21,199 --> 00:30:22,166
Hi, honey.

385
00:30:22,567 --> 00:30:23,659
Hi, Cinderella.

386
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:26,201
She's touching the phone.

387
00:30:27,205 --> 00:30:29,765
You Should see her face
at your voice.

388
00:30:30,308 --> 00:30:31,366
I love you.

389
00:30:31,576 --> 00:30:33,976
I love you too. Bye.

390
00:30:36,581 --> 00:30:38,549
I was just making dinner.

391
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,819
I've made enough for two,
as it happens.

392
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,988
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

393
00:30:44,189 --> 00:30:47,852
I wanted to let you know
I spoke to my people at the agency.

394
00:30:48,093 --> 00:30:51,085
I told them to keep
Mary Anne's case active.

395
00:30:52,264 --> 00:30:53,663
Well...

396
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:57,663
...stay for a drink, at least.

397
00:31:01,540 --> 00:31:03,167
You sure you're not hungry?

398
00:31:03,375 --> 00:31:06,367
It'd be nice to have a meal
without the TV on for once.

399
00:31:07,212 --> 00:31:08,873
I have a long drive ahead of me.

400
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:12,072
It's one of the most
depressing things. Eating alone.


401
00:31:12,284 --> 00:31:15,412
I don't know why. You'd think
I'd be used to it by now.

402
00:31:26,765 --> 00:31:27,891
Mrs. Mathews?

403
00:31:29,034 --> 00:31:30,296
Janet.

404
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:33,168
Do you ever consider....

405
00:31:33,638 --> 00:31:36,539
Do you realize that
Mary may never come back?

406
00:31:38,043 --> 00:31:40,136
I think about it every day.

407
00:31:40,845 --> 00:31:42,403
Every time the phone rings...

408
00:31:42,614 --> 00:31:45,947
...every time, I still think it's her.

409
00:31:46,718 --> 00:31:48,982
She's all I think about.

410
00:31:50,722 --> 00:31:52,383
Can you tell me...

411
00:31:53,258 --> 00:31:57,092
...if you had to make a choice,
if you were forced to choose...

412
00:31:57,562 --> 00:32:00,929
...between imagining her
out there somewhere...

413
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:04,260
...living a good life, being happy...

414
00:32:05,637 --> 00:32:07,366
...but you don't know...

415
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,836
...you never find out...

416
00:32:11,376 --> 00:32:13,435
...or the worst being true...

417
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,871
...her being gone...

418
00:32:17,215 --> 00:32:18,773
...but you know.

419
00:32:19,684 --> 00:32:21,379
You finally know...

420
00:32:22,887 --> 00:32:24,548
...what's happened to her.

421
00:32:26,191 --> 00:32:27,920
What would I choose?

422
00:32:29,227 --> 00:32:30,216
Yes.

423
00:32:34,232 --> 00:32:36,223
I would choose to know.

424
00:32:38,937 --> 00:32:40,905
I need to know.

425
00:32:47,646 --> 00:32:50,672
Excuse me,
I have to use your restroom.

426
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:46,228
You're leaving.

427
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:53,809
I値l call you if I find anything out.

428
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:37,933
How you doing?

429
00:36:39,244 --> 00:36:40,142
Big date tonight?

430
00:36:41,045 --> 00:36:42,706
Yeah, guess so.

431
00:36:42,914 --> 00:36:45,712
Could I interest you

in a battery-operated vagina?

432
00:36:46,584 --> 00:36:48,518
It's tempting, but no thanks.

433
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,219
I'd hate to see you caught in
one of those everyday situations...

434
00:36:52,423 --> 00:36:55,688
...that calls for a battery-operated
vagina and you don't have one.

435
00:36:55,927 --> 00:36:57,292
I値l risk it.

436
00:36:58,796 --> 00:37:01,697
All right, your total
is $7 4.58 please.

437
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:06,703
A hundred.

438
00:37:11,876 --> 00:37:15,607
Total痴 $25 and some change.

439
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,779
I'd like to thank you
for shopping at AduIt Bookstore.

440
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,545
And have yourself a fabulous day.

441
00:37:24,856 --> 00:37:26,414
What are you reading?

442
00:37:29,027 --> 00:37:30,995
Catchy title.
What are you really reading?

443
00:37:31,195 --> 00:37:34,289
Hard to believe it's got
any parts worth highlighting.

444
00:37:37,769 --> 00:37:39,259
Capote.

445
00:37:41,439 --> 00:37:42,531
You know how it is.

446
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:46,541
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
in front of your fellow perverts.

447
00:37:47,645 --> 00:37:50,842
I might get drummed out
of the pornographers' union.

448
00:37:51,082 --> 00:37:52,549
Where would I be then?

449
00:37:55,687 --> 00:37:57,279
Have a good day.

450
00:38:25,316 --> 00:38:26,283
How are you?

451
00:38:26,517 --> 00:38:27,984
Hey, honey.

452
00:38:28,319 --> 00:38:30,253
-How you doing?
-I知 a little beat.

453
00:38:30,488 --> 00:38:31,318
How's Cindy?

454
00:38:31,522 --> 00:38:33,456
She's sweet. She misses you.

455
00:38:33,658 --> 00:38:35,182
How's it going?

456
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,161

The way things are going,
I'm thinking about coming home.

457
00:38:39,464 --> 00:38:40,488
Really?

458
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,533
Honey, wait.

459
00:38:46,804 --> 00:38:47,964
Can I call you back?

460
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:51,368
I値l call you right back, l promise.
Bye, honey.

461
00:39:34,152 --> 00:39:35,619
Mrs. Christian, there were 3 men.

462
00:39:35,887 --> 00:39:38,412
Not just the cameraman
and the masked man.

463
00:39:38,990 --> 00:39:41,982
l caught a glimpse of a third man.
He was watching.

464
00:39:43,361 --> 00:39:46,296
I値l try to get a clearer image
through computer enhancement.

465
00:39:46,497 --> 00:39:49,728
But this probably happened
6 years ago, so it's not--

466
00:39:50,068 --> 00:39:51,831
All right, I値l keep trying.

467
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,970
Thank you.
l appreciate your support.

468
00:39:54,172 --> 00:39:55,002
Goodbye.

469
00:39:56,007 --> 00:39:59,204
What we have here is
1 37 billable man-hours...

470
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:01,970
...a hundred-plus thousand
dollars machine...

471
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:03,738
...and the resuIt is a...

472
00:40:04,615 --> 00:40:07,812
...fully rasterised enhancement
of the back of some guy's head.

473
00:40:08,853 --> 00:40:10,286
Want it framed?

474
00:40:12,056 --> 00:40:14,115
There you go. Have a nice day.

475
00:40:16,027 --> 00:40:19,121
It's like a gas station,
you pay before you pump.

476
00:40:20,131 --> 00:40:21,655
Remember me?

477
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:27,068
Came back for the battery-operated
vagina after all.

478
00:40:28,039 --> 00:40:30,371
I need information.
Maybe you could help.

479
00:40:30,641 --> 00:40:33,508
Thomas Welles. Nice picture.

480
00:40:34,045 --> 00:40:37,412
What sort of information?
Because I got all different kinds.

481
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:38,740
The kind I値l pay for.

482
00:40:39,684 --> 00:40:42,118
I don't know
what you're looking for...

483
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,515
...so we're clear from the start,
I'm straight.

484
00:40:44,722 --> 00:40:45,848
Congratulations.

485
00:40:46,057 --> 00:40:47,183
Thank you.

486
00:40:47,458 --> 00:40:48,425
Zip it!

487
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:49,923
I can hook you up.

488
00:40:50,128 --> 00:40:52,028
You name the vice,
I name the price.

489
00:40:52,563 --> 00:40:53,928
How long you been working here?

490
00:40:54,132 --> 00:40:55,827
Almost two years.

491
00:40:56,067 --> 00:40:58,228
What's your name,
if you don't mind me asking?

492
00:40:58,436 --> 00:40:59,926
Max.

493
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:02,228
Here's the deal.

494
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:05,238
This thing I'm on now has to do
with underground pornography.

495
00:41:05,443 --> 00:41:08,241
Stuff that's sold under
the counter, illegally.

496
00:41:08,446 --> 00:41:10,676
There's not much illegal out there.

497
00:41:10,915 --> 00:41:14,510
Whatever there is, I want to know.

I want a good look.

498
00:41:14,752 --> 00:41:18,415
So if you've got that kind of
connection, great. If not, speak now.

499
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:20,388
You're not a cop, are you?

500
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:22,889
If I ask and you are,

you got to tell me.

501
00:41:23,094 --> 00:41:24,584
I'm not a cop.

502
00:41:25,596 --> 00:41:26,722
A private detective?

503
00:41:26,931 --> 00:41:28,421
Like Shaft?

504
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,962
You ever seen Private Dicks?
I got it on sale.

505
00:41:32,203 --> 00:41:33,864
How much you make in there?

506
00:41:36,541 --> 00:41:39,840
Around 400 bucks a week,
off the books.

507
00:41:40,044 --> 00:41:42,342
Let's pretend I live
in the same fantasy world...


508
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:44,708
...where you make $400
a week in that dump.

509
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:47,179
I値l give you 500 for a few days.

510
00:41:47,418 --> 00:41:48,646
Six sounds good, Pops.

511
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,046
Five.

512
00:41:51,589 --> 00:41:53,318
Here's my number.

513
00:41:57,428 --> 00:41:59,123
When can you start?

514
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:02,227
Well, tomorrow night I get off late.

515
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:04,225
Tomorrow.

516
00:42:04,435 --> 00:42:05,367
All right.

517
00:42:05,570 --> 00:42:08,539
And don't call me Pops.

518
00:42:09,207 --> 00:42:12,404
Of course not. I wouldn't
want to hurt your feelings.

519
00:42:14,879 --> 00:42:16,744
Look, l don't know

what your scene is.

520
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:18,848
You may like porn
as much as the next guy.

521
00:42:19,083 --> 00:42:21,244
But you don't look
like your average sleaze.

522
00:42:21,485 --> 00:42:22,816
More like your average fucking cop.

523
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:27,582
So when you ask people about fucking
illegal stuff, it has a certain...

524
00:42:27,859 --> 00:42:28,826
...patina to it.

525
00:42:29,026 --> 00:42:29,958
Patina.

526
00:42:30,161 --> 00:42:32,186
It's a Truman Capote word.
Hello?

527
00:42:32,430 --> 00:42:34,295
If someone never saw
or sold a snuff film...

528
00:42:34,498 --> 00:42:36,193
...they Shouldn't care
what I ask.

529
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:38,368
If they have,
they Should be nervous.

530
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:41,299
Whoever acts insuIted,
keep knocking on their door.

531
00:42:41,505 --> 00:42:45,464
Look, Pops, it's not too late
to change your mind about all this.

532
00:42:45,676 --> 00:42:48,509
There's things you're going
to see that you can't unsee.

533
00:42:48,713 --> 00:42:50,305
They get in your head and stay there.

534
00:42:50,548 --> 00:42:52,106
How do you know what I've seen?

535
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:55,581
Okay, fine.
But everybody's got their limit.

536
00:42:55,820 --> 00:42:59,312
I've been here 6 fucking years
trying to get my music together.

537
00:42:59,557 --> 00:43:03,049
So I start part-time
where I work to make ends meet.

538
00:43:03,261 --> 00:43:06,697
And boom, a couple years go by,
and here I am.

539
00:43:06,931 --> 00:43:10,628
I'm just saying, before you know it,
you're in it. Deep in it.

540
00:43:10,835 --> 00:43:12,530
Don't worry about me.

541
00:43:12,770 --> 00:43:13,702
But thank you.

542
00:43:13,938 --> 00:43:15,633
You're welcome.

543
00:43:16,107 --> 00:43:19,270
Pops, you dance with the devil,
the devil don't change.

544
00:43:19,477 --> 00:43:21,342
Devil changes you.

545
00:43:21,779 --> 00:43:23,007
Some of your lyrics?

546
00:43:23,281 --> 00:43:24,111
That's cute.

547
00:43:35,493 --> 00:43:37,586
This place has been around
about 3 years...

548
00:43:37,795 --> 00:43:40,025
...but they keep moving it
house to house.

549
00:43:56,614 --> 00:43:58,582
This is the tip of the iceberg.

550
00:43:58,816 --> 00:44:01,614
Lots of Mexican S & M,
lots of Asian bondage...

551
00:44:01,819 --> 00:44:04,310
...all kinds of bestiality,
if you're into that.

552
00:44:05,256 --> 00:44:07,383
Don't touch nothing.
You want something, tell Friendly.

553
00:44:07,725 --> 00:44:08,783
Ask him.

554
00:44:21,272 --> 00:44:22,466
Don't do that!

555
00:44:22,773 --> 00:44:24,172
All right! It's cool!


556
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:27,338
All right? Okay.

557
00:44:35,486 --> 00:44:37,113
Come on, let's go.
All right!

558
00:44:41,659 --> 00:44:44,628
Are you a law enforcement agent
or affiliated with law enforcement?

559
00:44:44,829 --> 00:44:46,194
Fuck you, Larry.

560
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:50,424
Are you a law enforcement agent,
or affiliated with law enforcement?

561
00:44:50,668 --> 00:44:51,896
Fuck you, Lar.

562
00:44:52,103 --> 00:44:54,037
You're getting cool there, Welles.

563
00:44:54,238 --> 00:44:58,038
You got your porn zombies here.
Junkies for the hard stuff.

564
00:44:58,242 --> 00:45:00,369
But these basement sales
won't last much longer.

565
00:45:00,611 --> 00:45:02,772
One, it's too risky.
And two, everything's on the Net.

566
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,312
Chicken hawks swapping photos
with their modems.

567
00:45:05,549 --> 00:45:09,144
Then there's classified ads
with hidden codes, secret couriers...

568
00:45:09,387 --> 00:45:11,412
...wires through dummy corporations.

569
00:45:11,655 --> 00:45:14,886
If something's illegal, the buyers
are as far away as they can get.

570
00:45:15,092 --> 00:45:18,027
Nobody knows what nobody knows,
you know what I mean?

571
00:45:18,529 --> 00:45:19,860
How's it going, Samuel?

572
00:45:24,568 --> 00:45:26,160
I'm going to say hi to her.

573
00:45:26,737 --> 00:45:28,534
How are you? I love that.

574
00:45:28,739 --> 00:45:31,367
It's the Michael Jackson look,
with the zippers.

575
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:05,099
What are these?

576
00:46:06,010 --> 00:46:07,841
Extreme bondage.

577
00:46:08,179 --> 00:46:09,771
Rape films.

578
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:12,342
Sick shit.

579
00:46:12,783 --> 00:46:15,377
Buy five, get one for free.

580
00:46:17,188 --> 00:46:18,746
Anything harder?

581
00:46:18,989 --> 00:46:21,253
There's nothing harder.

582
00:46:22,059 --> 00:46:23,185
Snuff?

583
00:46:26,130 --> 00:46:28,621
There's no such thing as snuff.

584
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:31,296
What you see is what I got, mister.

585
00:46:31,502 --> 00:46:33,595
Do you know where I can get some?
I have a lot of money.

586
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:35,431
Fuck off.


587
00:47:23,621 --> 00:47:24,883
There she is.

588
00:47:25,122 --> 00:47:28,182
There she is.
It's Double Slap Dorothy.

589
00:47:28,392 --> 00:47:30,758
There's one chick that
could be a baseball player.

590
00:47:30,961 --> 00:47:32,792
The swing on her is unreal.

591
00:47:33,898 --> 00:47:37,493
Some of these S & M and bondage films
you値l see straddle the line.

592
00:47:37,701 --> 00:47:39,430
Foot fetish, orgies, shit films...

593
00:47:39,637 --> 00:47:42,231
...hermaphrodites, mutilation.
It's harder than hard-core.

594
00:47:42,439 --> 00:47:43,667
But mostly legal.

595
00:47:43,874 --> 00:47:44,738
Stick.

596
00:47:44,975 --> 00:47:46,340
One guy sees it and pukes.

597
00:47:46,544 --> 00:47:49,479
Another guy sees it
and he falls in love.

598
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:53,540
This is the guy I was telling you about.
You got the tapes?

599
00:47:55,019 --> 00:47:55,883
A thousand bucks.

600
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:58,350
-1 200 for the two.
-You told Max 1 000.

601
00:47:58,556 --> 00:48:02,856
I know, but this is more fun. I raise
the price, and you get pissed off.

602
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,528
-I thought we had a relationship.
-Is it real?

603
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:08,459
Sickest shit you値l ever see.

604
00:48:13,470 --> 00:48:14,528
Is that real?

605
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:18,034
That sure as shit looks real.

606
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:27,312
She's not breathing.

607
00:48:36,594 --> 00:48:38,221
Who makes these films?

608
00:48:38,495 --> 00:48:39,894
I don't know.

609
00:48:40,231 --> 00:48:42,256
Looks like the Philippines.

610
00:48:47,204 --> 00:48:49,764
Yeah, definitely the Philippines.

611
00:49:12,763 --> 00:49:15,391
Wait a minute.
That's the same girl.

612
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:17,032
Isn't that the same girl?

613
00:49:17,434 --> 00:49:18,526
Look.

614
00:49:20,037 --> 00:49:21,436
It is the same.

615
00:49:21,639 --> 00:49:22,765
They're fakes.

616
00:49:25,342 --> 00:49:26,969
That's great.

617
00:49:28,612 --> 00:49:31,809
Snuff 2: The Resurrection.

618
00:49:32,049 --> 00:49:33,539
Oh, boy.

619
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:36,309
Well, what do you expect for 1 200?

620
00:49:39,089 --> 00:49:41,580
You want a beer or something?
I could use anything.

621
00:49:43,327 --> 00:49:46,558
But I'm sorry, man.
I told you snuff was bogus.

622
00:49:46,764 --> 00:49:49,528
I just wish I would have
gotten you a receipt.

623
00:49:50,200 --> 00:49:51,394
''Hard Spank.''

624
00:49:51,969 --> 00:49:53,960
''Max California.''

625
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:56,105
That's my old band.

626
00:49:56,407 --> 00:49:57,704
We broke up.

627
00:49:57,908 --> 00:49:58,966
When?

628
00:49:59,310 --> 00:50:01,107
Maybe about a year ago.

629
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:04,811
I don't mean any offence...

630
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:07,609
...but what are you doing
mixed up in all this?

631
00:50:08,419 --> 00:50:11,388
I'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.

632
00:50:11,588 --> 00:50:14,318
You strike me as being smart enough
to do something else.

633
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:16,287
Thanks.

634
00:50:16,527 --> 00:50:18,995
I wish you owned a record label.

635
00:50:19,763 --> 00:50:22,391
Look, it beats pumping gas.

636
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,491
I don't buy it.
I don't endorse it.

637
00:50:26,270 --> 00:50:27,532
I just point the way.

638
00:50:28,839 --> 00:50:30,500
You said it gets to you.

639
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:32,139
Well, hell, yeah!

640
00:50:32,343 --> 00:50:34,834
Parade of losers I see every day?

641
00:50:35,045 --> 00:50:36,876
What choices have I got?

642
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:41,211
The music industry is not exactly
beating down my door.

643
00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:45,151
And what about you, Tom Welles?

644
00:50:45,522 --> 00:50:48,958
You got a ring on your finger.
You got kids?

645
00:50:49,326 --> 00:50:50,623
A daughter.

646
00:50:52,363 --> 00:50:54,593
So you got a wife and a daughter...

647
00:50:54,832 --> 00:50:56,732
...and a nice little yellow house...

648
00:50:56,934 --> 00:50:58,959
...and a dog named Shep.

649
00:50:59,236 --> 00:51:01,568
What the hell are you doing here?

650
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:05,899
Good question.

651
00:51:08,746 --> 00:51:10,680
Do you get turned on
at places like tonight?

652
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:13,877
No, I am not.

653
00:51:14,218 --> 00:51:16,448
You don't exactly
get turned off, either.

654
00:51:18,889 --> 00:51:20,880
Devil's changing you already.

655
00:51:21,325 --> 00:51:22,986
Good night, Max.

656
00:52:01,899 --> 00:52:05,562
This gentleman was asking if anyone
recognizes this girl.

657
00:52:07,571 --> 00:52:08,765
Yes.

658
00:52:08,972 --> 00:52:10,405
I remember Mary.

659
00:52:10,607 --> 00:52:12,472
Mary Anne Mathews?

660
00:52:13,877 --> 00:52:17,677
She lived here for only about a month,
if I recall correctly.

661
00:52:17,915 --> 00:52:21,817
She didn't return one night.
Do you know what happened to her?

662
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:25,011
Not yet, but I'm looking
into it for her parents.

663
00:52:25,289 --> 00:52:27,951
Could you get
that flowered one down for me?

664
00:52:28,659 --> 00:52:29,956
That's her suitcase.

665
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,391
I'd forgotten about it
till you showed me her picture.

666
00:52:34,298 --> 00:52:38,200
I suppose I always
hoped she'd be back.

667
00:52:38,402 --> 00:52:40,267
She seemed so lost.

668
00:52:40,471 --> 00:52:44,271
After a time, all I could do was pray
she'd moved on to better things.

669
00:52:44,475 --> 00:52:46,500
Can you get this suitcase
to her people?

670
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:48,007
If it's appropriate.

671
00:52:48,212 --> 00:52:49,702
Yes, of course. Thank you.

672
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:37,085
Starlight, star bright

673
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:38,989
First star I致e seen tonight

674
00:53:39,196 --> 00:53:41,391
l wish l may, wish l might

675
00:53:41,598 --> 00:53:44,032
Have this wish l wish tonight

676
00:53:48,906 --> 00:53:52,398
This number has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

677
00:53:54,211 --> 00:53:56,941
Hello, Hollywood Wax Museum.
Can l help you?

678
00:53:58,282 --> 00:54:00,648
This is operator 149.
What city and listing?

679
00:54:00,851 --> 00:54:03,012
l don't know. Hollywood.

680
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,389
A listing for Celebrity Films,
and l need an address.

681
00:54:06,590 --> 00:54:09,024
Please hold for
phone number and address.

682
00:54:33,383 --> 00:54:34,475
I was here first.

683
00:54:34,751 --> 00:54:36,343
Sorry, I値l just be a couple minutes.

684
00:54:39,423 --> 00:54:40,390
Eddie Poole?

685
00:54:41,258 --> 00:54:42,725
You a process server?

686
00:54:43,026 --> 00:54:45,494
No, I've been inquiring around.
Have you seen...

687
00:54:45,696 --> 00:54:47,391
...this girl come through here.?

688
00:54:47,898 --> 00:54:48,796
You a cop?

689
00:54:49,199 --> 00:54:50,894
I'm a member of her family.

690
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:53,126
You know how much pussy
comes through here?

691
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:57,171
Please, if you'd just take a look.
It would've been a few years.

692
00:55:06,350 --> 00:55:08,614
Her name is Mary Anne Mathews.

693
00:55:11,355 --> 00:55:12,822
Never seen her.

694
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:15,419
You sure?

695
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:18,886
I just looked
at the fucking picture, didn't I?

696
00:55:19,363 --> 00:55:21,331
Now come on.
I got a lot of shit to do.

697
00:55:25,569 --> 00:55:26,763
Who's next?


698
00:55:59,302 --> 00:56:00,735
They値l be fine.

699
00:56:41,545 --> 00:56:43,536
What kind of shit are you peddling?

700
00:56:43,747 --> 00:56:45,977
Come on. My tapes sell.
People eat the shit up.

701
00:56:46,216 --> 00:56:48,946
l had three jerks trying
to return your tapes last month.

702
00:56:49,219 --> 00:56:52,450
You know how bad it has to be
for some jackass to come back...

703
00:56:52,656 --> 00:56:55,682
...with a fucking receipt
and try to fucking return it?

704
00:56:55,892 --> 00:56:56,881
How bad?

705
00:56:57,094 --> 00:57:01,155
Get together some upscale product
where the girls still have teeth.

706
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:04,392
Till then, fuck you!

707
00:57:04,801 --> 00:57:06,393
Does your mother have any teeth?

708
00:57:06,603 --> 00:57:08,833
Because if she does,
send her down, you fuck.

709
00:58:13,570 --> 00:58:15,435
He's not answering.

710
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:43,959
Hey, boss.

711
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:46,192
There's a case of beer in there.

712
00:58:50,607 --> 00:58:51,665
How's your day?

713
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:53,035
Great.

714
00:58:54,811 --> 00:58:55,709
Is everybody here?

715
00:58:55,912 --> 00:58:57,709
Everybody but one of the chicks.

716
00:58:58,215 --> 00:58:59,648
-Been watching them?
-Yeah. Why?

717
01:00:15,892 --> 01:00:17,587
Celebrity Films.

718
01:00:18,995 --> 01:00:20,587
I know all about it.

719
01:00:20,830 --> 01:00:22,127
Yeah, you know about what?

720
01:00:22,332 --> 01:00:23,890
About that girl...

721
01:00:24,267 --> 01:00:25,996
...six years ago.

722
01:00:26,603 --> 01:00:28,434
I know what you did to her.

723
01:00:29,639 --> 01:00:30,799
Who is this?

724
01:00:31,007 --> 01:00:32,497
You murdered her.

725
01:00:33,009 --> 01:00:34,909
You and your friends.

726
01:00:35,912 --> 01:00:38,210
l don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

727
01:00:38,448 --> 01:00:39,745
You killed her on film.

728
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:41,481
And now you're fucked.

729
01:00:41,685 --> 01:00:43,482
You're all fucked.

730
01:00:57,968 --> 01:00:59,299
Come on.

731
01:01:05,575 --> 01:01:07,475
Come on, give me something, Eddie.

732
01:01:20,323 --> 01:01:21,483
It痴 me.

733
01:01:22,459 --> 01:01:23,824
What do you want?

734
01:01:24,027 --> 01:01:25,426
Look, l just got a phone call.

735
01:01:25,628 --> 01:01:28,358
We got to talk.
And we can't talk on the phone.

736
01:01:28,565 --> 01:01:31,534
So one of us
has to get on a plane, all right?

737
01:01:31,735 --> 01:01:34,670
Blow me, you paranoid fuck.

738
01:01:38,141 --> 01:01:39,972
Fuck! Fuck!

739
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,852
So you like to watch, paranoid fuck.

740
01:02:01,197 --> 01:02:03,961
Phone is listed under ''D. Velvet''
in Manhattan.

741
01:02:04,167 --> 01:02:05,099
Dino Velvet.

742
01:02:05,301 --> 01:02:08,498
He's a producer/director/weirdo.

743
01:02:08,705 --> 01:02:10,332
He's like the Jim Jarmusch of S & M.

744
01:02:10,540 --> 01:02:11,837
How hard is his stuff?

745
01:02:12,042 --> 01:02:13,304
How hard do you want it?

746
01:02:13,510 --> 01:02:15,569
Bondage, fetish, Gothic hard-core.

747
01:02:15,812 --> 01:02:17,211
Definitely not for the squeamish.

748
01:02:17,414 --> 01:02:18,972
It's kind of hard to come by.

749
01:02:19,215 --> 01:02:21,740
Mostly out of the back
of bondage magazines.

750
01:02:22,018 --> 01:02:23,349
But he's got fans.

751
01:02:23,553 --> 01:02:25,885
This guy I know, he thinks it's art.

752
01:02:26,089 --> 01:02:29,525
He's told me Velvet will do
commissions if there's enough dough.

753
01:02:29,726 --> 01:02:31,694
Nothing illegal, but borderline.

754
01:02:31,895 --> 01:02:34,887
If a guy wants to see
a transvestite in a rubber suit--

755
01:02:35,098 --> 01:02:36,258
I got the picture.

756
01:02:36,466 --> 01:02:38,593
Max, get in here!

757
01:02:39,636 --> 01:02:41,001
So...

758
01:02:41,204 --> 01:02:42,728
...you're going to New York?

759
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:44,201
Maybe.

760
01:02:44,874 --> 01:02:46,637
Looking like that.

761
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:48,609
You値l need me.

762
01:02:48,812 --> 01:02:52,213
This guy I know, Frenchie, is more
than just a fan of Velvet films.

763
01:02:52,449 --> 01:02:54,110
I could get you in if you want.

764
01:02:54,784 --> 01:02:56,251
For more money, of course.

765
01:02:56,453 --> 01:02:59,286
Plus expenses. I fly first class.

766
01:02:59,489 --> 01:03:01,047
So when are we leaving?

767
01:03:05,929 --> 01:03:07,396
What are you doing?

768
01:03:08,364 --> 01:03:11,765
Man, my first time in
the Big Bad Apple.

769
01:03:14,437 --> 01:03:16,405
I told you, don't film me.

770
01:03:16,706 --> 01:03:19,300
Fine, Howard Hughes.

771
01:03:29,419 --> 01:03:31,853
You didn't say it was going to be
this luxurious.

772
01:03:32,088 --> 01:03:33,055
It's the Presidential suite.

773
01:03:33,256 --> 01:03:35,224
You have a comforting
sense of humour.

774
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:37,323
I値l be a couple of doors down.

775
01:03:37,527 --> 01:03:40,462
Tom, I don't know why
we're staying in this fleabag.

776
01:03:40,663 --> 01:03:42,995
People mind
their own business in fleabags.

777
01:03:43,199 --> 01:03:46,396
I'm going out. Dig up
whatever Velvet tapes you can find.

778
01:03:46,603 --> 01:03:47,433
Get receipts.

779
01:03:48,938 --> 01:03:50,064
Yes, sir.

780
01:03:51,341 --> 01:03:54,333
My husband had
five cash accounts he used.

781
01:03:54,544 --> 01:03:56,102
Between November...

782
01:03:56,312 --> 01:03:58,041
...of 1 992...


783
01:03:58,715 --> 01:04:00,012
...and March...

784
01:04:00,316 --> 01:04:02,511
...of 1993...

785
01:04:02,685 --> 01:04:06,519
...he wrote one check
out to cash from each account.

786
01:04:07,757 --> 01:04:10,920
My husband never deaIt with money
personally.

787
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:12,719
Certainly not cash.

788
01:04:12,929 --> 01:04:15,830
These checks he wrote
are for very odd amounts.

789
01:04:16,032 --> 01:04:17,363
When totaled together...

790
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,261
...the five checks...

791
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:21,767
...from the five different accounts...

792
01:04:21,971 --> 01:04:24,337
...they equal $1 million.

793
01:04:24,974 --> 01:04:27,169
That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.

794
01:04:27,377 --> 01:04:29,470
I only mentioned this because...

795
01:04:29,679 --> 01:04:32,671
...you asked me to look
for anything unusual.

796
01:04:32,982 --> 01:04:35,450
I've got about $5,000 left in cash.

797
01:04:35,652 --> 01:04:39,418
I値l need another 50, if you approve
the plan I mentioned earlier.

798
01:04:39,656 --> 01:04:43,217
I'm very close to establishing
the identity of the man in the mask.

799
01:04:43,426 --> 01:04:45,621
I値l have Mr. Longdale arrange it.

800
01:04:45,828 --> 01:04:47,591
How will l get it to you?

801
01:04:47,830 --> 01:04:49,991
If you have a pen,
I値l give you the address.

802
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:53,669
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

803
01:05:25,835 --> 01:05:29,327
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

804
01:05:57,166 --> 01:05:59,794
Who is this? In the mask, who is he?

805
01:06:00,937 --> 01:06:02,768
Come on, wake up. Who is this?

806
01:06:03,006 --> 01:06:06,669
One of the lunatics Dino always uses.
He's in a bunch of these.

807
01:06:06,876 --> 01:06:07,808
What's his name?

808
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:10,775
I don't know. That's his whole thing.

809
01:06:11,014 --> 01:06:13,073
He always wears a mask.


810
01:06:13,316 --> 01:06:14,908
He calls himself ''Machete.''

811
01:06:15,151 --> 01:06:16,550
No, ''Machine.''

812
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:19,179
He calls himself Machine.

813
01:06:20,790 --> 01:06:23,088
He's a lover, man.

814
01:06:23,293 --> 01:06:26,421
Definitely loves what he does
for a living.

815
01:06:27,397 --> 01:06:29,456
I wish I could say the same about you.

816
01:06:40,176 --> 01:06:41,666
Yes, yes.

817
01:06:43,413 --> 01:06:46,211
I can see they
really appreciate my style here.

818
01:06:46,449 --> 01:06:49,111
I kind of blend in with the crowd here.

819
01:06:49,352 --> 01:06:50,444
If you didn't notice.

820
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:53,019
Like these ladies here,
they like my style.

821
01:06:58,795 --> 01:06:59,625
Who is it?

822
01:06:59,829 --> 01:07:01,729
Yes, this is Max California.

823
01:07:01,931 --> 01:07:04,661
I called earlier.
I'm a friend of Frenchie's from L.A.

824
01:07:04,901 --> 01:07:07,768
My partner and I
would like to speak to Mr. Velvet.

825
01:07:07,970 --> 01:07:09,335
He's not here.

826
01:07:09,972 --> 01:07:12,133
We're here to give him
a large sum of money.

827
01:07:12,342 --> 01:07:13,832
If he's not interested, we値l split.

828
01:07:32,562 --> 01:07:34,427
I don't know what you're talk about.

829
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:38,157
Can't you just answer
my simple question?

830
01:07:39,736 --> 01:07:43,365
I asked you a question!
Where the fuck is Laura?!

831
01:07:43,806 --> 01:07:46,604
That's what I've been asking you
the last 1 0 minutes.

832
01:07:46,809 --> 01:07:49,334
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

833
01:07:49,812 --> 01:07:50,904
You idiot!

834
01:07:51,147 --> 01:07:53,172
Going to shoot in two days?

835
01:07:53,416 --> 01:07:55,611
Man, you're spending my money.

836
01:07:55,852 --> 01:07:57,820
Yeah, you better do that.

837
01:07:58,454 --> 01:08:00,183
Fucking asshole.

838
01:08:00,390 --> 01:08:03,120
It's an honour to meet you.
Thank you for seeing us.

839
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:05,787
God.

840
01:08:08,464 --> 01:08:10,227
So, what can I do you for?

841
01:08:10,466 --> 01:08:15,369
We'd like to commission a film.
A Dino Velvet original, one of a kind.

842
01:08:15,905 --> 01:08:17,236
That's right.

843
01:08:17,740 --> 01:08:19,970
I'm a huge admirer of yours.

844
01:08:20,176 --> 01:08:22,474
God, I love flattery.

845
01:08:22,912 --> 01:08:26,040
You're a genius, Mr. Velvet.
A goddamn genius.

846
01:08:26,282 --> 01:08:28,512
The only one still transferring film
to video.

847
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:31,948
Nobody really appreciates
that kind of integrity anymore.

848
01:08:32,188 --> 01:08:34,679
The grain and the gritty look you get.

849
01:08:38,027 --> 01:08:39,358
Which is your favourite?

850
01:08:39,862 --> 01:08:40,988
If I had to choose...

851
01:08:41,197 --> 01:08:43,028
...it'd be Choke or Devil.

852
01:08:43,766 --> 01:08:44,926
The subliminal imagery...

853
01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:47,932
...in Choke is what
really gets under your skin.

854
01:08:48,905 --> 01:08:53,137
Well, Devil frightened me
as much as it excited me...

855
01:08:53,376 --> 01:08:56,038
...but I'd be hard-pressed
to choose a favourite.

856
01:09:00,583 --> 01:09:03,416
What kind of a budget
are we talking about?

857
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,147
Five thousand now.

858
01:09:07,089 --> 01:09:08,681
Five thousand upon delivery.

859
01:09:09,025 --> 01:09:11,255
Two women. One white, one black.

860
01:09:11,694 --> 01:09:13,719
Hard bondage, of course.

861
01:09:14,096 --> 01:09:15,927
Other than that, trusting your...

862
01:09:16,132 --> 01:09:18,191
...artistic interpretation...

863
01:09:18,401 --> 01:09:20,767
...I only have two stipulations.

864
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:27,141
Challenge me.

865
01:09:28,778 --> 01:09:30,575
I want to watch you work.

866
01:09:31,514 --> 01:09:34,244
You don't want a franchise, do you?

867
01:09:34,817 --> 01:09:37,786
Steal the recipe for my secret...

868
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:40,147
...hot sauce?

869
01:09:40,990 --> 01:09:42,252
No.

870
01:09:44,327 --> 01:09:45,521
That's good.

871
01:09:45,761 --> 01:09:47,752
I appreciate that.

872
01:09:53,102 --> 01:09:54,569
Second stipulation.

873
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:56,465
The other performer...

874
01:09:57,206 --> 01:09:58,969
...has to be...

875

01:09:59,175 --> 01:10:01,143
...that animal you use.

876
01:10:01,344 --> 01:10:02,936
The man in the mask.

877
01:10:04,347 --> 01:10:05,780
Machine.

878
01:10:12,989 --> 01:10:14,422
I don't know.

879
01:10:15,324 --> 01:10:17,155
He might be interested.

880
01:10:18,327 --> 01:10:21,524
But I think it値l cost you another...

881
01:10:24,066 --> 01:10:26,091
...five to seven grand.

882
01:10:26,502 --> 01:10:29,335
I can arrange something
really special for ten.

883
01:10:29,772 --> 01:10:31,171
We can do that.

884
01:10:31,374 --> 01:10:32,841
Good enough for me.

885
01:10:34,510 --> 01:10:38,503
I値l just have to put
my thinking cap on.

886
01:10:42,485 --> 01:10:45,750
I'm going to keep this as a deposit.

887
01:10:45,955 --> 01:10:49,015
You make sure you call me
after 1 0 o団lock tonight.

888
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:50,886
1 0 o団lock.

889
01:10:54,964 --> 01:10:57,091
You know, you have a very special...

890
01:10:57,300 --> 01:10:59,268
...very beautiful face.

891
01:10:59,468 --> 01:11:01,663
The way light hits it.

892
01:11:02,371 --> 01:11:04,236
I'd like to shoot you.

893
01:11:05,207 --> 01:11:06,333
You don't mind?

894
01:11:07,577 --> 01:11:09,010
I'm camera-shy.

895
01:11:09,345 --> 01:11:12,246
You trust me to take your money,
but not your picture?

896
01:11:12,481 --> 01:11:14,881
Those are two different kinds of trust.

897
01:11:15,418 --> 01:11:17,511
I hope we can do business.

898
01:11:26,429 --> 01:11:29,728
Hoyt Avenue, Brooklyn, 3 o団lock.

899
01:11:32,568 --> 01:11:33,728
I値l be there.

900
01:11:36,906 --> 01:11:39,306
I got something to tend to. Thanks.

901
01:11:40,109 --> 01:11:42,407
So are we in the movie business?

902
01:11:43,613 --> 01:11:44,511
That's for you.

903
01:11:44,714 --> 01:11:45,544
What is it?

904
01:11:45,748 --> 01:11:47,739
Money.
People use it to purchase goods.

905
01:11:48,284 --> 01:11:50,411
That's awfully generous
and everything--

906
01:11:50,653 --> 01:11:53,087
It's not mine.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

907
01:11:53,289 --> 01:11:56,986
There's a plane ticket and the flight
you can catch to L.A. tonight.

908
01:11:57,193 --> 01:11:59,127
This is as far as I want you to go.

909
01:11:59,328 --> 01:12:00,955
What are you talking about?

910
01:12:01,163 --> 01:12:02,790
We're a team. We're partners.

911
01:12:03,065 --> 01:12:07,832
Max, I'm sure you realize
these people we're dealing with...

912
01:12:08,771 --> 01:12:10,363
...they're extremely disturbed.

913
01:12:10,573 --> 01:12:13,667
That's why you need me.
I know disturbed. Look at me.

914
01:12:13,909 --> 01:12:16,844
You did a great job here.
It's time for you to go home.

915
01:12:17,079 --> 01:12:18,740
But this is our big case.

916
01:12:19,615 --> 01:12:22,175
Tom, I know what's going on, okay?

917
01:12:22,718 --> 01:12:23,912
Okay, what?

918
01:12:24,153 --> 01:12:26,986
Dino and Machine and Eddie
made a snuff film, right?

919
01:12:27,189 --> 01:12:29,180
I can't figure out why you're involved.

920
01:12:29,458 --> 01:12:30,891
What, maybe the victim--?

921
01:12:31,127 --> 01:12:32,526
First, who said you're right?

922
01:12:32,728 --> 01:12:35,026
Second, who said
anything about a victim?

923
01:12:35,464 --> 01:12:37,557
Only 3 rules in life, Tom Welles.

924
01:12:37,800 --> 01:12:41,065
One, there's always a victim.
And two, don't be it.

925
01:12:41,270 --> 01:12:42,100
And three?

926
01:12:42,304 --> 01:12:43,464
I forgot three.

927
01:12:43,673 --> 01:12:45,834
Good, I want you to forget everything.

928
01:12:46,042 --> 01:12:49,375
I want you to get on a plane,
go back to L.A. and forget it all.

929
01:12:50,813 --> 01:12:52,576
I get a lot of calls for work
on the West Coast.

930
01:12:52,848 --> 01:12:55,316
I'd like to call you again.
I could use help.

931
01:12:55,518 --> 01:12:57,816
You're going to look me up and call me?

932
01:12:58,020 --> 01:13:01,888
I could use your help. I meant it
when I said I think you're smart.

933
01:13:02,124 --> 01:13:04,251
I'm not patronizing you.

934
01:13:04,460 --> 01:13:05,791
Well, thanks.

935
01:13:06,195 --> 01:13:08,959
All right.
Well, you take care, Max California.

936
01:13:15,237 --> 01:13:18,172
All right, Tom Welles.
Devil's waiting on you.

937
01:14:40,956 --> 01:14:42,753
There you are.

938
01:14:43,092 --> 01:14:45,083
Come and join us.

939
01:14:56,772 --> 01:14:58,433
Hello, Machine.

940
01:14:59,608 --> 01:15:00,370
Love your work.

941
01:15:05,781 --> 01:15:08,545
Did you bring the money?

942
01:15:09,819 --> 01:15:11,252
It's right here.

943
01:15:11,453 --> 01:15:12,442
Good.

944
01:15:14,089 --> 01:15:15,420
Where are the women?

945
01:15:15,624 --> 01:15:17,091
Women...

946
01:15:18,160 --> 01:15:20,185
...they're always late.

947
01:15:26,936 --> 01:15:28,198
What are these for?

948
01:15:28,938 --> 01:15:31,168
They're just props.

949
01:15:31,373 --> 01:15:33,364
Nice, aren't they?

950
01:15:33,642 --> 01:15:37,703
Machine and I were just talking
about the beauty of knives.

951
01:15:41,150 --> 01:15:44,119
My guests have arrived!

952
01:15:46,355 --> 01:15:48,220
Mister W., would you be so kind...

953
01:15:48,424 --> 01:15:51,416
...as to remove
any firearms from your person?

954
01:15:52,161 --> 01:15:53,150
What are you doing?

955
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:57,163
I hate to repeat myself.
It makes me look so stupid.

956
01:15:57,766 --> 01:15:58,960
Slowly.

957
01:15:59,168 --> 01:16:01,432
Please, show me your gun.

958
01:16:02,605 --> 01:16:04,004
Nice and easy!

959
01:16:05,374 --> 01:16:07,569
That's right. Easy.

960
01:16:07,776 --> 01:16:09,437
Good.

961
01:16:09,778 --> 01:16:12,770
Now empty those bullets onto the table.

962
01:16:12,948 --> 01:16:14,438
Very carefully.

963
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:17,642
-I don't know why you think--
-Shut up, you fuck!

964
01:16:18,187 --> 01:16:22,419
I値l put an arrow right through
your goddamn throat, you understand?

965
01:16:28,530 --> 01:16:29,827
That's him.

966
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,390
Last bullet. That's last one.

967
01:16:33,102 --> 01:16:34,228
Good boy.

968
01:16:34,436 --> 01:16:37,064
Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.

969
01:16:37,506 --> 01:16:38,939
Yes, sir.

970
01:16:39,174 --> 01:16:40,436
Machine!

971
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:50,283
I didn't know
what to make of you at first.

972
01:16:52,421 --> 01:16:56,551
And you certainly had Eddie here
on pins and needles.

973
01:16:58,127 --> 01:17:01,096
Lo and behold,
from right out of the blue came...

974
01:17:01,330 --> 01:17:05,664
...an old business acquaintance of ours
to explain everything.

975
01:17:06,001 --> 01:17:09,368
Satan ex machina.

976
01:17:10,205 --> 01:17:12,867
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

977
01:17:15,811 --> 01:17:16,937
Let's get this over with.

978
01:17:17,179 --> 01:17:19,272
Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

979
01:17:21,383 --> 01:17:24,511
What I could do
with faces like these on film.

980
01:17:25,287 --> 01:17:29,053
But on second thought,
why would I need their faces?

981
01:17:30,092 --> 01:17:31,457
You're going to listen to me.

982
01:17:31,660 --> 01:17:33,218
You're going to get that film.

983
01:17:33,429 --> 01:17:36,398
You're going to
bring it back here, give it to me.

984
01:17:36,832 --> 01:17:40,962
Just so we make this
as efficient as possible...

985
01:17:41,170 --> 01:17:43,832
...there is an incentive.

986
01:17:54,850 --> 01:17:56,977
He's got nothing to do with this.

987
01:17:57,219 --> 01:17:58,914
He doesn't know anything.

988
01:17:59,355 --> 01:18:02,950
Can't you guess
what I'm about to say next?!

989
01:18:04,660 --> 01:18:07,026
If you don't bring me that film...

990
01:18:07,229 --> 01:18:09,561
...we're going to kill him, fuck him...

991
01:18:09,999 --> 01:18:11,466
...and film it.

992
01:18:14,837 --> 01:18:17,135
If that's not enough for you...

993
01:18:17,473 --> 01:18:20,169
...we're going to go after your family.

994
01:18:22,945 --> 01:18:24,572
I値l get the film.

995
01:18:26,849 --> 01:18:28,111
Good boy.

996
01:18:28,350 --> 01:18:29,908
You're being very cooperative.

997
01:18:30,486 --> 01:18:33,387
Mr. Longdale here
will keep you company.

998
01:18:34,456 --> 01:18:35,423
Why me?

999
01:18:35,657 --> 01:18:38,125
Because I don't like you, Mr. Longdale.

1000
01:18:47,870 --> 01:18:49,394
Mr. W...

1001
01:18:52,908 --> 01:18:54,307
...hurry back.

1002
01:18:58,847 --> 01:19:01,213
Since I met you,
there isn't much you've done...

1003
01:19:01,450 --> 01:19:03,008
...that I haven't been party to.

1004
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:06,254
None of this would be happening
if you'd given up and walked away.

1005
01:19:06,488 --> 01:19:09,116
Or better yet,
not taken the job in the first place.

1006
01:19:09,324 --> 01:19:11,758
I never expected you to get this far.

1007
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:13,951
I hired you because you're young...

1008
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:16,063
...and completely out of your league.

1009
01:19:16,298 --> 01:19:18,823
But I underestimated your ambition.

1010
01:19:19,034 --> 01:19:21,730
You took one look
at the Christian compound.

1011
01:19:22,704 --> 01:19:23,693
It was heady, wasn't it?

1012
01:19:23,906 --> 01:19:25,771
You weren't just peeking through
the gates this time.

1013
01:19:25,974 --> 01:19:27,999
No, Mrs. Christian welcomed you in.

1014
01:19:28,210 --> 01:19:31,702
Do you think people like
the Christians hire people like us...

1015
01:19:31,914 --> 01:19:34,144
...as an invitation
to their dinner parties?

1016
01:19:34,383 --> 01:19:36,044
No, we're there to clean up the mess...

1017
01:19:36,285 --> 01:19:38,753
...to wipe their royal asses.

1018
01:19:39,021 --> 01:19:40,682
You were asked to buy a snuff film.

1019
01:19:40,889 --> 01:19:44,052
They couldn't find one,
so you paid them to make you one?

1020
01:19:44,259 --> 01:19:46,022
Isn't that what happened?

1021
01:19:46,528 --> 01:19:49,156
She was alive
till you paid to have her murdered?

1022
01:19:49,364 --> 01:19:51,264
How much did Christian
pay for your conscience?

1023
01:19:51,467 --> 01:19:52,297
A million?

1024
01:19:53,102 --> 01:19:54,729
I've been well compensated.

1025
01:19:54,937 --> 01:19:56,802
But you, I bought cheap.

1026
01:19:58,373 --> 01:20:01,900
Just because Mrs. Christian
praised your discretion...

1027
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:03,578
...you sat on evidence of murder.

1028
01:20:03,779 --> 01:20:05,406
Dragged your friend, family...

1029
01:20:05,614 --> 01:20:08,139
...into some old graveyard...

1030
01:20:08,383 --> 01:20:12,319
...to dig up a dead girl with no name
that nobody cares about or remembers.

1031
01:20:12,588 --> 01:20:13,885
Mary Anne Mathews.

1032
01:20:14,089 --> 01:20:15,522
That was her name.

1033
01:20:15,757 --> 01:20:17,122
Her mother remembers her.

1034
01:20:17,326 --> 01:20:18,759
I'm bored with this.

1035
01:20:19,094 --> 01:20:21,289
You know the only difference
between us?

1036
01:20:21,497 --> 01:20:24,762
I will survive this and profit by it,
whereas you...

1037
01:20:24,967 --> 01:20:26,127
...you will not.

1038
01:20:26,335 --> 01:20:27,927
Now get the film.

1039
01:20:33,542 --> 01:20:35,237
Did you watch it with him?

1040
01:20:35,444 --> 01:20:36,308
What?

1041
01:20:36,512 --> 01:20:38,742
The snuff film.

Did you watch it with him?

1042
01:20:38,947 --> 01:20:41,279
This isn't helping your friend.
Get the film.

1043
01:20:41,517 --> 01:20:42,506
Did it get him off?

1044
01:20:43,085 --> 01:20:44,450
Mr. Christian?

1045
01:20:44,653 --> 01:20:47,986
Watching them cut her up like that?
Did he jerk off to it?

1046
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:50,420
Did you hold his cock?
Give him the hand job...

1047
01:20:50,659 --> 01:20:53,526
...while Mary Anne Mathews was dying?

1048
01:20:53,729 --> 01:20:56,459
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to understand!

1049
01:20:56,665 --> 01:20:58,929
What did he want with a snuff film?!

1050
01:20:59,334 --> 01:21:00,266
You're asking why?

1051
01:21:00,435 --> 01:21:02,369
Yes, why? Why?!

1052
01:21:02,604 --> 01:21:04,538
Why did he want a film...

1053
01:21:04,773 --> 01:21:07,264
...of a little girl being butchered?!

1054
01:21:08,610 --> 01:21:10,009
Because he could.

1055
01:21:10,612 --> 01:21:12,477
He did it because he could.

1056
01:21:14,583 --> 01:21:16,050
What other reason
were you looking for?

1057
01:21:20,822 --> 01:21:22,153
Now.

1058
01:21:36,438 --> 01:21:37,666
Here.

1059
01:21:38,407 --> 01:21:39,874
Shoot me.

1060
01:21:48,850 --> 01:21:51,318
Mr. Welles, the film, please.

1061
01:21:52,387 --> 01:21:53,684
Let him go first.

1062
01:21:53,889 --> 01:21:56,357
Do whatever you want to me,
but let him go.

1063
01:21:56,625 --> 01:21:58,889
Very well. Set him free, Machine.

1064
01:22:35,564 --> 01:22:37,532
-Is that it?
-That's it.

1065
01:22:37,733 --> 01:22:38,893
Bravo.

1066
01:22:40,369 --> 01:22:42,269
I don't think you want to miss this...

1067
01:22:42,471 --> 01:22:44,132
...Mr. Welles.

1068
01:22:53,448 --> 01:22:55,416
So it ends.

1069
01:22:57,419 --> 01:22:59,979
As if she never existed.

1070
01:23:00,455 --> 01:23:03,982
Don't blame yourself.
You were in way over your head.

1071
01:23:04,559 --> 01:23:06,459
You motherfuckers.

1072
01:23:08,697 --> 01:23:11,222
You smalItime motherfuckers.

1073
01:23:12,968 --> 01:23:14,833
I want to know something:

1074
01:23:15,304 --> 01:23:19,297
Why you're still smalItime with a
million dollars to spread around?!

1075
01:23:19,808 --> 01:23:20,740
Million?

1076
01:23:20,976 --> 01:23:23,877
Yeah! That's what Christian
gave Longdale!

1077
01:23:24,646 --> 01:23:26,443
That's what he gave you, right?

1078
01:23:26,682 --> 01:23:27,979
A million in cash?

1079
01:23:28,350 --> 01:23:30,580
You stupid fucking trash!

1080
01:23:30,852 --> 01:23:34,788
What the hell--
Is he talking dollars here?

1081
01:23:35,023 --> 01:23:36,650
No, he's lying.

1082
01:23:36,858 --> 01:23:38,189
Did you fuck me?

1083
01:23:39,561 --> 01:23:40,789
Did you fuck me on this?

1084
01:23:41,029 --> 01:23:42,155
Of course not, Edward!

1085
01:23:42,364 --> 01:23:44,423
Then what's he talking about?

1086
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:45,793
He's saying that...

1087
01:23:46,034 --> 01:23:47,558
...Longdale fucked us...

1088
01:23:47,769 --> 01:23:50,738
...which is so totally,
completely bizarre.

1089
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:52,372
Stay back.

1090
01:23:52,974 --> 01:23:54,100
Stay away from me.

1091
01:23:54,876 --> 01:23:56,275
Put the bow down!

1092
01:23:56,478 --> 01:23:58,378
I told you not to trust the prick.

1093
01:23:58,613 --> 01:24:01,207
Mr. Longdale, if there's no honour...

1094
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:03,315
...among perverts and pornographers...

1095
01:24:03,518 --> 01:24:05,611
...the whole business would fall apart.

1096
01:24:05,854 --> 01:24:09,517
Because there's no records,
no contracts, no legal recourse.


1097
01:24:09,791 --> 01:24:11,418
So if someone...

1098
01:24:11,626 --> 01:24:12,854
...cheats us...

1099
01:24:13,061 --> 01:24:14,722
...that person can't be trusted.

1100
01:24:14,930 --> 01:24:17,592
That person could turn us in,
have us killed.

1101
01:24:18,867 --> 01:24:22,633
So we don't have a choice,
do we, Mr. Longdale?

1102
01:24:22,871 --> 01:24:25,863
I want this to be over.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

1103
01:24:26,074 --> 01:24:27,632
Eddie, take your gun out.

1104
01:24:28,076 --> 01:24:29,100
Fuck you.

1105
01:24:29,311 --> 01:24:31,506
Take it out now! And drop it.

1106
01:24:31,713 --> 01:24:33,374
Or I will shoot.

1107
01:24:33,682 --> 01:24:35,650
Don't be stupid, Edward.

1108
01:24:41,089 --> 01:24:42,613
Kick it in my direction. Hard.

1109
01:24:46,428 --> 01:24:48,919
Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.

1110
01:24:53,435 --> 01:24:54,868
Action.

1111
01:25:06,481 --> 01:25:08,278
This is wrong.

1112
01:25:08,517 --> 01:25:10,246
Something's wrong.

1113
01:25:11,086 --> 01:25:12,519
God, not like this.

1114
01:25:14,489 --> 01:25:16,753
I am supposed to have...

1115
01:25:17,592 --> 01:25:19,423
...something more cinematic.

1116
01:25:20,028 --> 01:25:21,757
Kill them, Machine.

1117
01:25:23,098 --> 01:25:24,690
Kill them all.

1118
01:25:32,274 --> 01:25:33,434
Machine!

1119
01:26:14,816 --> 01:26:15,612
Stop, Eddie!

1120
01:26:17,219 --> 01:26:18,208
I swear to Christ!

1121
01:26:18,487 --> 01:26:19,954
I値l shoot you in the back!

1122
01:26:21,756 --> 01:26:22,984
Take off the mask.

1123
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:26,721
Take off the fucking mask!

1124
01:26:26,928 --> 01:26:28,987
He's only got one bullet!

1125
01:28:11,166 --> 01:28:12,690
Amy, listen carefully.

1126
01:28:12,901 --> 01:28:15,233
-Tom, where are you?
-Amy, just listen.

1127
01:28:15,437 --> 01:28:17,735
Take Cindy. Get out of the house now.

1128
01:28:17,939 --> 01:28:20,339
Go to where we spent
Fourth of July weekend.

1129
01:28:20,575 --> 01:28:23,373
-Why? What's wrong?
-Amy, please. l can't.

1130
01:28:23,578 --> 01:28:25,637
I値l be there in three hours.

1131
01:28:26,147 --> 01:28:27,910
I'm on my way! Go now!

1132
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:30,284
Tom, you're scaring me.

1133
01:28:30,485 --> 01:28:32,282
Please, Amy, just do it!

1134
01:28:33,188 --> 01:28:35,247
Okay, bye. I'm going.

1135
01:28:43,131 --> 01:28:44,928
Mrs. Christian, it's Tom Welles.

1136
01:28:45,133 --> 01:28:46,464
Longdale is dead.

1137
01:28:46,668 --> 01:28:48,761
He was killed by the men
who made the film.

1138
01:28:48,970 --> 01:28:52,133
He hired them for your husband.
Kept most of the million.

1139
01:28:52,340 --> 01:28:54,137
The film is real!

1140
01:28:54,342 --> 01:28:55,639
They killed that girl!

1141
01:28:57,646 --> 01:28:59,011
Mrs. Christian?

1142
01:28:59,214 --> 01:29:01,978
I'm still here, Mr. Welles.

1143
01:29:02,217 --> 01:29:03,650
I'm sorry. I know this must be--

1144
01:29:03,852 --> 01:29:05,342
Are you in danger?.

1145
01:29:05,620 --> 01:29:08,350
We値l go to the police.
I値l tell you everything tonight.

1146
01:29:08,556 --> 01:29:10,353
We can call the police in the morning.

1147
01:29:10,625 --> 01:29:11,592
All right.

1148
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:13,186
Eight o団lock?

1149
01:29:13,395 --> 01:29:15,226
Yes, eight o団lock is fine.

1150
01:29:15,463 --> 01:29:16,623
Do you know...

1151
01:29:16,865 --> 01:29:20,858
...what the poor girl's name was?

1152
01:29:23,204 --> 01:29:25,138
Mary Anne Mathews.

1153
01:29:28,877 --> 01:29:29,866
Thank you.

1154
01:29:30,245 --> 01:29:32,304
Mr. Welles, goodbye.

1155
01:30:30,171 --> 01:30:32,002
Are you okay?

1156
01:30:33,942 --> 01:30:35,170
Are you?

1157
01:30:36,111 --> 01:30:38,477
Why haven't you called me?

1158
01:30:41,216 --> 01:30:44,481
Why did you disappear
off the face of the Earth?

1159
01:30:45,653 --> 01:30:47,211
You're bleeding.

1160
01:30:47,822 --> 01:30:49,380
Are those handcuffs?

1161
01:30:49,657 --> 01:30:51,488
Were you locked up?

1162
01:30:52,427 --> 01:30:55,225
Kept from a phone? What happened?

1163
01:30:55,430 --> 01:30:56,488
Start talking, Tom.

1164
01:30:56,698 --> 01:31:00,532
Because if you want to stay married,
you can't treat me this way!

1165
01:31:01,369 --> 01:31:02,597
You're right.

1166
01:31:02,804 --> 01:31:04,772
Everything you say is right.

1167
01:31:07,142 --> 01:31:09,633
That won't do it.
That's not enough, Tom.

1168
01:31:09,844 --> 01:31:11,004
Not anymore.

1169
01:31:12,180 --> 01:31:14,774
I'm not going to let
anything happen to us.

1170
01:31:15,016 --> 01:31:17,109
Look where we are!

1171
01:31:17,685 --> 01:31:20,483
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself! Look!

1172
01:31:21,322 --> 01:31:22,789
You son of a bitch.

1173
01:31:23,024 --> 01:31:26,755
You don't even have any idea
what you're putting me through.

1174
01:31:28,696 --> 01:31:32,063
What was I supposed to think
happened to you?

1175
01:31:37,839 --> 01:31:39,830
We're going to stay here a few days.

1176
01:31:40,041 --> 01:31:41,440
It's just a few days.

1177
01:31:41,676 --> 01:31:42,973
I'm sorry.

1178
01:31:43,178 --> 01:31:44,475
There's no other way around this.

1179
01:31:44,679 --> 01:31:46,943
Okay, look. I swear, I swear...

1180
01:31:49,284 --> 01:31:52,310
...I won't let anything happen to us.
I値l take care of it.

1181
01:31:52,554 --> 01:31:54,215
I swear it.

1182
01:31:55,156 --> 01:31:56,680
I swear it.

1183
01:31:58,660 --> 01:32:00,719
Now I have to go back out.

1184

01:32:01,496 --> 01:32:02,724
Where?

1185
01:32:06,167 --> 01:32:08,226
I have to see Mrs. Christian.

1186
01:32:09,103 --> 01:32:11,094
She's the only witness.

1187
01:32:12,207 --> 01:32:13,435
To what?

1188
01:32:15,877 --> 01:32:17,742
We're going to be okay.

1189
01:32:20,748 --> 01:32:22,545
We're going to be okay.

1190
01:32:36,798 --> 01:32:38,993
Tom Welles.
Mrs. Christian's expecting me.

1191
01:32:39,234 --> 01:32:41,168
Yes, she left instructions.

1192
01:32:41,903 --> 01:32:44,463
I have to see her now.
It's extremely urgent.

1193
01:32:45,073 --> 01:32:49,066
Mrs. Christian chose to take
her own life this afternoon, Mr. Welles.

1194
01:32:54,349 --> 01:32:55,646
But I just....

1195
01:32:56,317 --> 01:32:57,909
No, no, I just....

1196
01:32:59,621 --> 01:33:00,952
I just spoke to her.

1197
01:33:01,155 --> 01:33:04,318
Her instructions were
that this first envelope...

1198
01:33:05,159 --> 01:33:06,649
...is for Mary's family.

1199
01:33:06,961 --> 01:33:09,555
She wrote that you'd understand
what that meant.

1200
01:33:10,465 --> 01:33:12,660
And the second envelope is for you.

1201
01:33:14,903 --> 01:33:18,771
Services will be held next week,
if you'd like to attend.

1202
01:33:20,408 --> 01:33:22,069
I am sorry, sir.

1203
01:33:22,844 --> 01:33:23,970
Good night, sir.

1204
01:33:59,681 --> 01:34:01,080
What are you doing?

1205
01:34:03,952 --> 01:34:05,579
I have to go back.

1206
01:34:16,898 --> 01:34:18,695
Whatever it is...

1207
01:34:19,033 --> 01:34:20,898
...wherever you were...

1208
01:34:21,135 --> 01:34:23,296
...just forget about it.

1209
01:34:23,504 --> 01:34:25,165
You stay here.

1210
01:34:25,707 --> 01:34:27,231
I can't.

1211
01:34:30,311 --> 01:34:33,474
And risk us? Risk your family? Why?

1212
01:34:34,916 --> 01:34:37,384
There's no one left
to finish this but me.

1213
01:34:38,519 --> 01:34:40,646
I値l call you when it's safe to go home.

1214
01:34:43,391 --> 01:34:45,951
We may not be there
when you get back.

1215
01:35:00,308 --> 01:35:03,539
Cindy's education, and a lot more.

1216
01:35:13,388 --> 01:35:14,855
I love you.

1217
01:36:06,774 --> 01:36:09,038
Put your hands on your head.
Down on your knees.

1218
01:36:11,079 --> 01:36:13,070
You think I'm fucking around?

1219
01:36:16,184 --> 01:36:17,310
Hurts, doesn't it?

1220
01:36:17,585 --> 01:36:18,984
What the fuck do you want?

1221
01:36:19,187 --> 01:36:20,245
Who's Machine?

1222
01:36:20,488 --> 01:36:21,682
Where does he live?

1223
01:36:22,423 --> 01:36:23,617
I don't know.

1224
01:36:23,825 --> 01:36:25,292
I want his name.

1225
01:36:25,593 --> 01:36:26,924
I don't know his name.

1226
01:36:30,965 --> 01:36:33,160
I will never get tired of hurting you.

1227
01:36:33,367 --> 01:36:37,428
I don't know his name. He shows up
in his mask, he leaves in his mask.

1228
01:36:37,638 --> 01:36:39,538
He's from New York somewhere.

1229
01:36:44,979 --> 01:36:46,310
Get in the car.

1230
01:36:48,416 --> 01:36:49,212
Why?

1231
01:36:49,851 --> 01:36:52,149
You're going to show me
where you killed her.

1232
01:36:53,087 --> 01:36:54,213
Fuck you.

1233
01:36:56,524 --> 01:36:58,424
All right, you fuck.

1234
01:37:12,440 --> 01:37:14,670
What did you do before
you brought her here?

1235
01:37:15,943 --> 01:37:18,377
Tell her how beautiful she was...

1236
01:37:19,614 --> 01:37:21,775
...how you'd make her a big star?

1237
01:37:27,221 --> 01:37:28,688
Talk her up?

1238
01:37:32,994 --> 01:37:34,985
What the fuck do you want from me?

1239
01:37:39,267 --> 01:37:40,598
I want to know.

1240
01:37:44,172 --> 01:37:45,537
You want to know?

1241
01:37:49,544 --> 01:37:50,943
She was nothing.

1242
01:37:51,279 --> 01:37:52,769
A little piece of pussy off the street.

1243
01:37:53,014 --> 01:37:55,505
Girl like that disappears,
nobody gives a shit.

1244
01:37:57,118 --> 01:37:59,416
Yeah, I talked her up.

1245
01:37:59,654 --> 01:38:02,953
Told her everything she wanted to hear.
I told her she'd be a big star...

1246
01:38:03,157 --> 01:38:06,456
...she'd make a lot of money,
and all the rest of the bullshit.

1247
01:38:06,661 --> 01:38:10,654
By the time I was finished, she was
all excited about her big screen test.

1248
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:14,363
I called up Dino...

1249
01:38:14,569 --> 01:38:17,538
...he and Machine flew out here.
We had a little party.

1250
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:20,998
What else you want to know?

1251
01:38:22,176 --> 01:38:23,700
You saw the film, right?

1252
01:38:24,579 --> 01:38:26,046
You know the ending.

1253
01:38:28,249 --> 01:38:30,444
Nobody else saw you bring her in?

1254
01:38:33,087 --> 01:38:35,954
Who's going to see?
Place is a fucking shithole.

1255
01:38:39,560 --> 01:38:41,391
I brought her in and she...

1256
01:38:43,231 --> 01:38:45,722
...saw Machine
standing in the corner.

1257
01:38:47,168 --> 01:38:48,760
She started crying...

1258
01:38:50,771 --> 01:38:52,898
...making these little noises.

1259
01:38:55,142 --> 01:38:57,736
So I slapped her around a bit
just to shut her up.

1260
01:38:58,346 --> 01:38:59,506
Dino...

1261
01:38:59,747 --> 01:39:01,681
...fed her a bunch of pills.

1262
01:39:03,317 --> 01:39:05,842
Machine put down the plastic over here.

1263
01:39:09,156 --> 01:39:11,056
Just started cutting her up.

1264
01:39:14,996 --> 01:39:16,896
That's it. She's dead.

1265
01:39:17,632 --> 01:39:20,658
She's been dead a long time.
Nobody gives a shit but you.

1266
01:39:35,449 --> 01:39:37,144
You wanted to know.

1267

01:39:37,618 --> 01:39:39,142
Now you know.

1268
01:39:41,188 --> 01:39:42,678
You were in here.

1269
01:39:42,957 --> 01:39:46,518
You watched Mary Anne
bleed to death from here.

1270
01:39:48,062 --> 01:39:49,051
Why?

1271
01:39:50,965 --> 01:39:52,626
Why did you watch?

1272
01:39:53,701 --> 01:39:54,998
I feIt like it.

1273
01:39:57,138 --> 01:39:58,969
I never saw nobody get done before.

1274
01:40:00,007 --> 01:40:00,996
Why?

1275
01:40:02,310 --> 01:40:04,608
Did you get hard? Did you come?

1276
01:40:04,812 --> 01:40:07,303
No. It made me sick.

1277
01:40:07,548 --> 01:40:09,209
But what do I give a shit...

1278
01:40:09,450 --> 01:40:13,580
...if some rich fucking wacko wants
to beat off to something like that?

1279
01:40:13,854 --> 01:40:15,185
Stay down!

1280
01:40:17,558 --> 01:40:19,458
It was something I did for money.

1281
01:40:22,129 --> 01:40:24,120
I needed the fucking money.

1282
01:40:24,965 --> 01:40:26,398
Where is she?

1283
01:40:26,600 --> 01:40:28,124
Where did you put her body?

1284
01:40:28,536 --> 01:40:30,299
I buried it in the woods.

1285
01:40:31,706 --> 01:40:32,695
You're not going to find it.

1286
01:40:32,907 --> 01:40:35,102
If you find it, so what?
What do you got?

1287
01:40:35,309 --> 01:40:37,573
You got a girl's skeleton, that's it.

1288
01:40:37,778 --> 01:40:39,871
Without the film, you got nothing.

1289
01:40:40,815 --> 01:40:42,783
So all you can do is cut me loose.

1290
01:40:42,983 --> 01:40:45,417
Because without the film
you got nothing--

1291
01:40:45,619 --> 01:40:47,143
What the fuck are you doing?!

1292
01:40:47,421 --> 01:40:49,355
-Put your hands behind your back.
-Fuck you!


1293
01:40:50,257 --> 01:40:52,657
Put your hands behind your back!

1294
01:40:52,860 --> 01:40:54,350
All right.

1295
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,591
What the fuck are you doing?

1296
01:41:07,475 --> 01:41:09,306
I'm going to kill you.


1297
01:41:10,878 --> 01:41:12,641
I'm going to kill you.

1298
01:41:14,448 --> 01:41:17,781
And I'm going to leave you here
just like you left her.

1299
01:41:19,820 --> 01:41:21,515
You're not going to kill me.

1300
01:41:22,256 --> 01:41:23,518
You don't have it in you.

1301
01:41:24,925 --> 01:41:27,689
What are you going to do?
Shoot me with your own gun?

1302
01:41:27,895 --> 01:41:29,328
Registered in your name?

1303
01:41:31,599 --> 01:41:34,329
You really thought this through,
didn't you, genius?

1304
01:41:34,535 --> 01:41:36,935
You値l have to dig
the bullets out of my head.

1305
01:41:37,138 --> 01:41:38,833
That値l be nice.

1306
01:41:40,841 --> 01:41:42,638
Or you could dig a hole.

1307
01:41:43,544 --> 01:41:44,806
Dig it with your own hands...

1308
01:41:45,012 --> 01:41:47,003
...and bury me next to your girlfriend.

1309
01:41:47,581 --> 01:41:48,809
Go ahead.

1310
01:41:49,517 --> 01:41:50,609
Pull the fucking trigger.

1311
01:41:51,152 --> 01:41:52,050
Go ahead.

1312
01:41:52,253 --> 01:41:54,380
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, do it.

1313
01:41:54,622 --> 01:41:56,089
You faggot!

1314
01:41:58,259 --> 01:42:00,250
What do you want me to do?
Start crying?

1315
01:42:00,461 --> 01:42:02,895
Like a baby?
''I'm so sorry I killed the girl.''

1316
01:42:03,097 --> 01:42:04,997
Fuck you! And fuck her!

1317
01:42:05,199 --> 01:42:08,965
Go ahead, put me out of my misery.
Pull the fucking trigger.

1318
01:42:10,137 --> 01:42:11,764
Pull the fucking trigger.

1319
01:42:12,273 --> 01:42:13,262
Do it!

1320
01:42:14,208 --> 01:42:15,140
Do it!

1321
01:42:22,650 --> 01:42:24,208
You can't do it.

1322
01:42:25,152 --> 01:42:27,211
You little pansy bitch!

1323
01:42:27,488 --> 01:42:28,682
Look at you...

1324
01:42:28,889 --> 01:42:30,823
...big fucking hero, man.

1325
01:42:31,025 --> 01:42:32,583
You can't fucking do it.

1326
01:42:34,528 --> 01:42:35,825
Look at him.

1327
01:42:36,697 --> 01:42:38,255
Big fucking hero.

1328
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,391
Go on home to your wifey!

1329
01:42:42,670 --> 01:42:44,331
You pussy!

1330
01:42:45,005 --> 01:42:46,996
You big fucking pussy!

1331
01:42:48,776 --> 01:42:51,176
What are you going to do now, faggot?

1332
01:42:53,614 --> 01:42:55,775
You can't go to the cops!

1333
01:42:57,184 --> 01:43:01,587
Send me your wife and daughter.
We値l make a film, you faggot!

1334
01:43:04,992 --> 01:43:06,186
Shit.

1335
01:43:06,694 --> 01:43:08,252
You punk-ass!

1336
01:43:55,342 --> 01:43:57,071
Mrs. Mathews?

1337
01:43:57,444 --> 01:43:59,173
It's Thomas.

1338
01:43:59,547 --> 01:44:01,208
Thomas Hart.

1339
01:44:01,482 --> 01:44:04,815
I was there a few weeks ago
asking about your daughter.

1340
01:44:05,486 --> 01:44:07,818
Yeah, you found her diary.

1341
01:44:08,022 --> 01:44:09,319
Thank you.

1342
01:44:10,190 --> 01:44:12,158
She did leave a note...

1343
01:44:12,526 --> 01:44:16,860
...and her stupid boyfriend
dumped her in California...

1344
01:44:17,331 --> 01:44:18,764
...so I told the FBI.

1345
01:44:19,733 --> 01:44:21,257
Remember when...

1346
01:44:22,236 --> 01:44:24,830
...I asked you if you'd want to know...

1347
01:44:26,040 --> 01:44:27,405
...the truth...

1348
01:44:28,208 --> 01:44:29,835
...no matter what?

1349
01:44:30,844 --> 01:44:34,678
Some men, they took her and
they killed her and they buried her.

1350
01:44:35,049 --> 01:44:35,879
No, no.

1351
01:44:36,116 --> 01:44:37,549
I知 sorry.

1352
01:44:37,918 --> 01:44:38,782
I知 sorry.

1353
01:44:39,286 --> 01:44:41,550
I want to punish them for what they did.


1354
01:44:42,056 --> 01:44:44,024
Why are you saying this?

1355
01:44:44,224 --> 01:44:45,953
I can hurt them.

1356
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:49,723
Give me your permission
to hurt them, please.

1357
01:44:50,731 --> 01:44:52,722
Tell me how much she meant to you.

1358
01:44:53,834 --> 01:44:55,961
Just tell me that you loved her.

1359
01:44:56,170 --> 01:44:57,603
Please tell me that you loved her.

1360
01:44:57,805 --> 01:44:59,136
I love her.

1361
01:44:59,573 --> 01:45:01,404
I love her so much.

1362
01:45:03,944 --> 01:45:06,105
I love her so much.

1363
01:45:13,253 --> 01:45:14,584
Who's that?

1364
01:45:17,524 --> 01:45:18,354
No!

1365
01:45:20,227 --> 01:45:22,092
Die, you motherfucker, die!


1366
01:46:57,958 --> 01:46:58,925
New York Hospital.

1367
01:46:59,193 --> 01:47:00,990
Can you connect me to the nurse?

1368
01:47:01,195 --> 01:47:02,184
Emergency.

1369
01:47:02,396 --> 01:47:04,864
It痴 Lt. Anderson of the 13th precinct.

1370
01:47:05,065 --> 01:47:08,125
Have you admitted an aduIt male
with an abdominal wound...

1371
01:47:08,335 --> 01:47:10,826
...in the last 48 hours?
A stabbing incident.

1372
01:47:11,038 --> 01:47:12,528
Abdominal wound?

1373
01:47:12,740 --> 01:47:13,832
No, not one.

1374
01:47:14,041 --> 01:47:15,303
Thank you.

1375
01:47:15,642 --> 01:47:19,203
I知 looking for a stabbing victim.
Male. Maybe six feet.

1376
01:47:19,413 --> 01:47:21,313
Filed a bogus report.

1377
01:47:22,082 --> 01:47:24,607
We had a guy in on Monday, l think.

1378
01:47:24,852 --> 01:47:26,979
It would be yesterday
or the day before.

1379
01:47:27,221 --> 01:47:28,085
Sorry.

1380
01:47:28,956 --> 01:47:31,754
-Queens County Emergency.
-Hi, Lt. Anderson.

1381
01:47:31,959 --> 01:47:33,790
We had a stabbing incident...

1382
01:47:34,027 --> 01:47:36,257
...and supposed victim gave us
a false name.

1383
01:47:36,463 --> 01:47:38,328
A male with an abdominal wound.

1384
01:47:38,532 --> 01:47:40,591
Hold on. Let me check my records.

1385
01:47:40,801 --> 01:47:43,497
There was a patient treated yesterday.

1386
01:47:43,704 --> 01:47:45,695
Star tattoo on his right hand?

1387
01:47:46,106 --> 01:47:47,767
Yes. George Anthony Higgins.

1388
01:47:47,975 --> 01:47:52,469
Insurance policy is under his
mother's name, Doris Veronica Higgins.

1389
01:47:52,713 --> 01:47:54,943
That's him.
Can you give me an address?

1390
01:47:55,182 --> 01:47:56,911
It痴 under her address. Douglaston.

1391
01:47:57,151 --> 01:47:58,311
Need a street?

1392
01:48:34,521 --> 01:48:37,422
l really wish you'd go
to church with me tonight.

1393
01:48:42,930 --> 01:48:44,659
l love you, son.

1394
01:48:48,769 --> 01:48:51,203
I値l be home by 10. Bye-bye.

1395
01:53:44,531 --> 01:53:46,590
You know the best part
of killing someone?

1396
01:53:47,000 --> 01:53:49,059
The look on their face.

1397
01:53:49,269 --> 01:53:50,827
It's that look...

1398
01:53:51,037 --> 01:53:52,629
...not when they're threatened...

1399
01:53:52,839 --> 01:53:54,466
...not when you hurt them...

1400
01:53:54,774 --> 01:53:57,334
...not even when they see the knife.

1401
01:53:57,878 --> 01:53:59,971
It's when they feel the knife go in.

1402
01:54:00,180 --> 01:54:01,306
That's it.

1403
01:54:01,781 --> 01:54:03,408
It's surprise.

1404
01:54:03,650 --> 01:54:05,777
They can't believe
it's really happening.


1405
01:54:06,019 --> 01:54:07,247
She had that look.

1406
01:54:07,787 --> 01:54:08,913
The girl...

1407
01:54:09,156 --> 01:54:10,817
...when she knew it wasn't just porno.

1408
01:54:11,024 --> 01:54:12,150
Feel how hard I am?

1409

01:54:24,037 --> 01:54:25,698
Take off the mask.

1410
01:54:41,855 --> 01:54:44,016
What did you expect, a monster?

1411
01:54:52,332 --> 01:54:54,061
My name's George.

1412
01:54:54,267 --> 01:54:56,167
Probably knew that already.

1413
01:54:58,738 --> 01:55:00,228
Can't get your mind around it?

1414
01:55:01,174 --> 01:55:02,835
I don't have any answers.

1415
01:55:03,210 --> 01:55:06,179
Nothing I say is going
to make you sleep easier at night.

1416
01:55:06,379 --> 01:55:09,280
I wasn't beaten. I wasn't molested.

1417
01:55:09,516 --> 01:55:11,279
Mommy didn't abuse me.

1418
01:55:13,253 --> 01:55:14,515
Daddy never raped me.

1419
01:55:15,155 --> 01:55:16,247
I'm only what I am.

1420
01:55:17,724 --> 01:55:19,589
That's all there is to it!

1421
01:55:32,038 --> 01:55:33,403
There's no mystery.

1422
01:55:33,940 --> 01:55:37,341
Things I do, I do them because
I like them.

1423
01:55:38,912 --> 01:55:40,436
Because I want to.

1424
01:56:28,428 --> 01:56:30,760
You've been stabbed? How many times?

1425
01:56:30,964 --> 01:56:33,330
Sir, can you tell me your name?

1426
01:57:24,684 --> 01:57:25,946
Is that you?

1427
01:57:29,656 --> 01:57:30,850
My God.

1428
01:57:48,842 --> 01:57:50,207
Save me.

1429
01:57:55,515 --> 01:57:57,039
Save me.

1430
01:59:13,126 --> 01:59:14,821
Dear Mr. Welles:

1431
01:59:15,028 --> 01:59:16,427
Thank you for writing...

1432
01:59:16,629 --> 01:59:18,790
...and telling me your real name...

1433
01:59:19,032 --> 01:59:21,830
...who you really are
and what really happened.

1434
01:59:22,035 --> 01:59:24,367
I知 glad those men are dead.

1435
01:59:24,737 --> 01:59:27,900
But nothing will ever
fill the hole in my heart.

1436
01:59:28,107 --> 01:59:31,099
l will try to use
the money you sent for some good...

1437
01:59:31,311 --> 01:59:33,779
...after l get some help for myself.

1438
01:59:33,980 --> 01:59:36,244
l hated you
for telling me the truth...

1439
01:59:36,483 --> 01:59:40,010
...but now l realize you and l
are probably the only people...

1440
01:59:40,253 --> 01:59:42,744
...that ever really
cared about Mary Anne.

1441
01:59:42,989 --> 01:59:44,581
Yours truly...

1442
01:59:44,958 --> 01:59:46,425
...Janet Mathews.
