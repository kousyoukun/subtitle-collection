It's unpleasant, I know.

Discreet, isn't he?
他不是很谨慎吗？

16
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,360
What an imbecile!
蠢蛋

17
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,720
I tried to warn my daughter..

00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,200
有人吗？
Hello?

25
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,200
你回来了
You're home.

26

我们在这里
We're back here.

27
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,600
一切顺利吗？
How did it go?

28
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:11,920
还不错吧
I think very well.

29
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,440

30

甜心，爹地回来了
Daddy's home, sweetie.

31
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,960
你教科书工作如何？
How's the textbook business?

32
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,320
那个联邦剧场的方案
我收到一万字
I got 1 0,000 words on
the federal theatre project.

33
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,960
应该只有四千字
但作者拒绝修改
It should be 4,000 and the writer
doesn't want to change anything.

34
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,440
所以有点麻烦
So kind of bad.

35
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:31,440
迈阿密怎样？
How was Miami?

36
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,200
不错，只是寂寞
Fine. Lonesome.

37
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,360
就算付我很多钱
我也不要住在那
Couldn't pay me enough
to live down there.

38
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,280
那你为什么去？
Then why'd you go?

39
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,880
麦可孙议员有很多
有势力的朋友
Senator Michaelson has
powerful friends.

40
00:04:46,640 --> 00:04:48,720
哈，仙蒂
Hello, Cinderella.

41
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,480
想我吗？我好想你
Did you miss me?
I sure missed you.

42
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,320
-她很想你
-这才对
-She missed you.
-That's my girl.

43
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,880
她想你，我也想你
She missed you.
I missed you.

44
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,640
你吸烟？
You been smoking?

45
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,920
吸烟？ 我没有吸烟
Smoking? I'm not smoking.

46
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,880
别这样，蜜糖儿
Come on, honey.

47
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,120
你一身的烟味
You reek of it.

48
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:10,760
艾美，我坐在酒吧内
跟踪那男人
Amy, I've been sitting around
in bars following this guy.

49
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,840
这就是你给我的见面礼？
Is this the first thing I get?

50
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,760
-你在指责我吗？
-我没有指责你
-You're accusing me?
-I'm not accusing you.

51
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,680
我没有吸烟，好不好？
我们以前就讲过了
I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been all through that.

52
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,920
我去弄晚餐，你肚子饿吗？
I'll make dinner.
Are you hungry?

53
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,160
你烧饭？
You're cooking?

54
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,920
我想你
I missed you.

55
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,440
我不喜欢你不在家
I don't like it when you leave.

56
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,680
该我去吗？
Should I go?

57
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,760
我去吧
I'm going to do it.

58
00:05:58,440 --> 00:05:59,800
来吧
Come on.

59
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,800
有什么事，仙蒂？
What's all the trouble, Cinderella?

60
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,120
乖，乖
There, there.

61
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,480
我爱你
I love you.

62
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,320
我爱你
I love you.

63
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,080
蜜糖儿，电话
Honey, phone!

64
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:46,400
好，我在听
Okay, I've got it!

65
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:49,320
对不起，我正在换电话
Sorry, I was just switching phones.

66
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,680
我很荣幸认识你，龙雕先生
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Longdale.

67
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,080
我有什么能为你效劳？
How can I be of assistance to you?

68
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,440
四点整没问题
Four o'clock would be fine.

69
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,520
我想我知道在那里
I think I know where it is.

70
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:55,160
魏斯先生，我是丹尼龙雕
我们通过电话
Mr. Welles, Daniel Longdale.
We spoke on the phone.

71
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:56,160
你好
Pleasure.

72
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,480
我是柯立斯纯家族的律师和
财产处理人
I'm the Christians' attorney and
one of the executors of the estate.

73
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,800
这位是柯太太
This is Mrs. Christian.

74
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,800
很荣幸认识你，夫人
It's an honour to meet you, ma'am.

75
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:05,560
魏斯先生，你有很高的评价
You come highly recommended,
Mr. Welles.

76
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,640
我和我在哈里斯堡，兰卡士达
以及荷西的合伙人谈过
I've spoken to assoclates of mine in
Harrisburg and Lancaster and Hershey.

77
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,480
你认识很多有影响力的人物
You have influential friends.

78
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,760
我很庆幸可以为我崇拜的人
提供服务
I've been privileged to provide
services for people I admire.

79
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:17,400
你的谨慎被赞赏
You were praised
for your discretion...

80
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,920
还有你能保守秘密
...your strict adherence
to confidentiality.

81
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:22,080
谢谢你，夫人
Thank you, ma'am.

82
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:28,360
你知道，我丈夫最近逝世
As you know,
my husband passed away recently.

83
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,840
请节哀，夫人
My condolences, Mrs. Christian.

84
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,600
他的离开留给我….
His passing has left me...

85
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,360
一些需要解决的事
...with a dilemma.

86
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,680
我会尽力帮忙
I'll do whatever I can to help.

87
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,000
这是我丈夫的私人书房
My husband's inner sanctum.

88
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,680
没有什么人曾经进入这房内
Not many people have been
inside this room.

89
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,200
我父亲在匹兹堡钢铁场工作
My father worked the Pittsburgh mill.

90
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,680
我相信是尔稳联合钢铁
Irving United Steel, I believe.

91
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,360
但你拿到宾州大学奖学金
But you attended Penn
on an academic scholarship.

92
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:55,680
没错
That's right.

93
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,440
你同学都念法律和财经
而你选择侦探学
Peers went into law and finance,
but you chose surveillance.

94
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,520
我知道那才是将来
I decided it was the future.

95
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,360
你丈夫是个传奇
Your husband is a legend.

96
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,720
请坐
Please.

97
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:06,440
我们结婚四十五年
We were married 45 years.

98
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:09,960
四个儿女，七个孙子
Four children, seven grandchildren.

99
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,200
但他真正醉心的
But his true passion lay...

100
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,680
是他的工作
...in his work.

101
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,760
但他一直很忠心
But he was always loyal.

102
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,440
我非常地
I loved him...

103
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,040
深爱他
...deeply.

104
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,880
我明白
I understand.

105
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,640
丹尼
Daniel.

106
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,040
只有我丈夫一人知道
这保险箱的密码
My husband was the only one with
the combination to this safe.

107
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,880
我们请人把它打开
We had to hire somebody to open it.

108
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,400
我避免让任何人
I prevented anyone...

109
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,720
看保险箱内的东西
...from seeing the contents.

110
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,080
我觉得那是我丈夫的私人物品
I felt these were
my husband's private things.

111
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,360
我没有…..
I didn't....

112
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,240
我没有察觉….
I didn't realize....

113
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,480
你想告诉我发现什么吗？
Do you want to tell me
what you found?

114
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,120
现金，股票
Cash, stock certificates.

115
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:56,600
没有什么不寻常，真的，除了….
Nothing out of the ordinary,
really, except that.

116
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,600
一套短片
It's a film...

117
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,920
好像有个少女被杀
...where a girl appears to be murdered.

118
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,920
我不肯定我明白
I'm not sure I understand.

119
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,760
拍的很真实
It's very realistic.

120
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,280
但每天有多少人在电影或电视上
But how many people seem to be
realistically killed...

121
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,280
好像真的被杀害
in movies and on TV every day?

122
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,760
开始时像一套低俗的色情电影
It begins as a relatively
sleazy bit of pornography...

123
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:21,040
但突然变的很暴力和血腥
...and rapidly turns
quite violent and bloody.

124
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,120
你所说的叫色情暴力电影
What you're talking about
is called a snuff film.

125
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,600
照我所知，色情暴力电影
是都市神话
From what I know,
snuff films are an urban myth.

126
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,200
性行业的传说，根本没有这回事
Sex industry folklore.
There's no such thing.

127
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,280
我也这样向柯太太解释
That's what I explained
to Mrs. Christian.

128
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,040
这可能是一些性虐待的电影
This is probably
an S & M film of some sort.

129
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,200
模拟强奸，模拟暴力
Simulated rape, simulated violence.

130
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,720
令人倒胃口，但都是拍出来的
It's hard to stomach,
but there are ways of doing it.

131
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,520
假血浆，特别效果
Fake blood, special effects.

132
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
请你看完这影片后
告诉我你的意见
Would you look at the film
and give us your opinion?

133
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,800
我只希望
All I want...

134
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,240
知道这暴行是假的
...is to know that
this atrocity is false.

135
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,560
我要证据
I want the proof.

136
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,760
嗯….
Well...

137
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:58,080
拍这电影的人拍的非常传神
...whoever made the film was adept
at authenticity.

138
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,920
我不是专家，我提议
让警方去决定
But I'm no expert. I suggest letting
the police make a determination.

139
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,080
不可能
Out of the question.

140
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,000
有几个原因说明这是不必要
That would be so unnecessary
for any number of reasons...

141
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:09,440
不单只是为了柯先生的名誉
...not the least of which is
Mr. Christian's reputation.

142
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
我们只想你找出拍这套影片的人
We want you to find out
who made this film...

143
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,040
证实这是真是假
...and establish whether it's real.

144
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,840
你可以开个价钱
You can name your price.

145
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,840
我们会供应
你买资料用的任何资源
You'll be provided with whatever
you need to buy information.

146
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,120
那少女是唯一的线索
Girl's all I've got to go on.

147
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,120
我可以当它是
一宗人口失踪案件
I could treat it
like a missing persons case.

148
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,280
明白
Understood.

149
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,520
当然….
Of course...

150
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,440
我们要确保你不会拷贝这套影片
...we need to be assured
that you would not copy this film.

151
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:35,520
我向你保证
You have my word on that.

152
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,960
我只向你汇报
But I'll be dealing
directly with you...

153
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:39,120
只向你一个
...and only you.

154
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,280
你与你律师的关系如何
是你的事
Your relationship with
your attorney is your own.

155
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,480
-不是对你不礼貌
-不会
-No offense.
-None taken.

156
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:46,960
我觉得你已经详细的考虑过
I realize you've given this
careful consideration.

157
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:49,880
你可以毁灭它
You could have destroyed it.

158
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,720
告诉我这可怜的少女没有被杀
Tell me the poor girl wasn't killed.

159
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,240
求你
Please?

160
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,400
找到她，要活着的
Find her alive.

161
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,720
我会尽力，夫人
I'll do the best I can, ma'am.

162
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:41,000
你要去克利夫兰？
Cleveland?

163
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,200
你刚到家
You just got home.

164
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,200
我也希望可以留下
但这是房子的贷款
And I wish I could stay,
but this is the mortgage.

165
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,920
仙蒂上大学的学费
It's Cindy's college money.

166
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,360
如果我办好这事
凭柯太太的社交圈子
If I do right by her,
with the circle she runs in...

167
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:51,040
这会是一个难得的机会
...this could be a big break.

168
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,680
我不认为我们需要什么机会
I didn't know we needed a break.

169
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
你父亲认为我们需要
Your father seems to think we do.

170
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,800
那，柯太太是怎样的人？
So, what was Mrs. Christian like?

171
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,440
就像你所想像的
我为她感到难过
Like you'd expect, I guess.
I feel sorry for her.

172
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:05,720
那是宗人口失踪案
It's a missing persons.

173
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,720
我告诉她我会用两至三周时间
I told her I'd give it
a couple, three weeks.

174
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:12,360
不该会用更多的时间
成功的机会不大
It can't take longer than that.
It's an outside shot.

175
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:16,720
我只能告诉你这么多
你最好不要知道那么多
That's all I can tell you. Sometimes
you can't know what I'm doing.

176
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,200
常常是这样
It's always that way.

177
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:21,960
她醒了，我去看她
She's awake. I'll get her.

178
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,960
好吧，我很快会上去
All right, I'll be up in a sec.

179
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,920
-你带枪？
-我不需要它
-You're taking the gun?
-I won't need it.

180
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,000
那不要带
Don't take it.

181
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,920
我不会用它，这只是作预防
I won't wear it.
It's just a precaution.

182
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,000
别担心
Don't worry.

183
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,840
你到了那里，会给我打电话吗？
Will you call me
when you get there, please?

184
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,760
费城的一对医生夫妇聘请我
I've been hired by a couple in
Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.

185
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:25,280
几天前，他们在81公路
载了一名搭顺风车
A few days ago, they picked up
a girl hitchhiking off 81...

186
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,520
约十八岁的离家出走少女
..a runaway, about 18, maybe.

187
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:29,120
他们请她吃饭
They buy her a meal.

188
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:31,600
那医生尝试劝她
The doctor tries to convince her...

189
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,040
最低限度，给家里打个电话
...that, at the very least,
she should call home.

190
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,800
一如所料，那少女吃完
Not surprisingly, the girl ate,
excused herself...

191
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,720
便藉词离开
...that was the last they saw of her.

192
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,040
我有个在警局有关部门工作的
朋友画了一张略图
We had a friend of mine at
the department work up a sketch.

193
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,480
他们想看看我能否确认这少女
They want to see
if I can ID this girl...

194
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,880
然后转告给她的父母
...then pass along
a message to the parents...

195
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,200
让他们知道这孩子还活着
...letting them know
the kid's alive.

196
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,200
你不介意我作核对？
You don't mind if I run a check?

197
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,800
请自便
Go ahead.

198
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,800
你想怎样就怎样
You want it, you got it.

199
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:57,240
随便找你需要的资料
Knock yourself out.

200
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,880
每年约有八十五万至
一百万人失踪
Anywhere from 850,000 to 1 ,000,000
missing every year.

201
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,560
我们已尽量将资料存入电脑
其他的，你就要翻看资料卡
We have as much as we can on computer,
then it's the wet-thumb method.

202
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,640
档案根据失踪的
州县及年份排列
Files are by state and year
of disappearance.

203
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:08,400
我们把成年人和儿童分开
We keep children
and adults separate.

204
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:10,000
请勿进食或吸烟
No eating or smoking.

205
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,920
-大厅有咖啡机
-味道好吗？
-The coffee machine's in the hall.
-Any good?

206
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,240
很难喝
Horrible.

207
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,400
几天后，它会成为你的好朋友
It'll be your best friend
after a few days...

208
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,240
如果你撑到那么久
...if you last that long.

209
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,640
祝你好运
Good luck.

210
00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:23,920
蜜糖儿，是我
Honey, it's me.

211
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,000
你好吗？
How are you?

212
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,240
我很好
I'm good.

213
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
你在哪？
Where are you?

214
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:30,600
我还在克利夫兰，仙蒂怎样？
I'm still in Cleveland.
How's Cindy?

215
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:33,680
她很乖，她在睡觉
She's sweet.
She's sleeping.

216
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,680
我非常想你
I'm missing you bigtime.

217
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,600
我也很想你
Yeah, l miss you too.

218
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:40,480
我明天再打电话给你
I'll call you tomorrow.

219
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,360
好的，晚安
Okay. Good night.

220
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,280
晚安，甜心
Good night, sweetheart.

221
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,880
豪华544

222
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,640
喂，柯太太？
汤魏斯
Hello, Mrs. Christian?
Tom Welles.

223
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,120
进展是这样
Here's where we stand.

224
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,720
我查到那套影片的底片
型号是“豪华544”
l checked the film stock.
It's called Supralux 544.

225
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,560
生产商在九二年
已经停止生产这型号的底片
The company that made that
stock discontinued it in '92.

226
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:42,240
所以那套影片是在之前制作的
So the film was made prior to that.

227
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:45,240
我已经查得非常的仔细了
I'm probably being overly
thorough with this...

228
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,600
但你可不可能找出
你丈夫在六至七年前的
...but you might want to dig up your
husband's financial records...

229
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:50,480
财政记录
...about 6 or 7 years ago.

230
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,400
看看有什么不寻常的地方
See if there's anything
out of the ordinary.

231
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,240
很明显，这不是一套你可以拿到
快洗照相馆去冲洗的底片
Obviously, this isn't a movie
you drop off at the one-hour photo.

232
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,320
那你认为这是唯一的拷贝
So you think it's one of a kind.

233
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,960
这个底片经过摄影机
拍成的，是没有底片的
The film that went through the camera
is what we've got. There's no negative.

234
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,360
不像录影带，它不是可以随便复制的
Unlike video, it's not really
designed to be duplicated.

235
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,720
无论如何，我觉得….
Whatever this is,
l have a feeling...

236
00:19:08,920 --> 00:19:11,840
即使有拷贝流传，相信
也不会有很多
...there aren't many copies
floating around, if any.

237
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,720
我在找一个不肯定是否
失了踪的少女
I'm looking for a girl we're
not sure is missing.

238
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:18,600
发生在六，七年前
With this happening 6 or 7 years ago...

239
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,680
找出制作这套影片的人
...finding the guys
who made this film...

240
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,120
老实说，将会是件很困难的事
...frankly, is going
to be very difficult.

241
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,440
我知道你做得到，你做得很好
l know you can do it.
You're doing a wonderful job.

242
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:29,880
请告诉我你会继续调查
Please tell me you'll
continue the investigation.

243
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,120
我会，我会为你尽力去做
l will. I'll keep trying for you.

244
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,880
你可以信赖我
再见，柯太太
You can count on me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.

245
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,560
我们现在未能接听你的电话
请在讯号之后留下留言
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave a message at the beep.

246
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,880
蜜糖儿，是我
Honey, it's me.

247
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,080
对不起，我昨晚
忘了打电话给你
I'm sorry I forgot
to call last night.

248
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,960
我今晚不会忘记
I won't forget tonight.

249
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,000
我已经离家很久
我希望可以尽快回家
I've been gone a long time
and I hope I'll be home soon.

250
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:53,120
我爱你，我挂念你，今晚再谈
I love you, and I miss you.
We'll talk tonight.

251
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,840
北卡罗莱纳

252
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:34,000
玛丽 安麦修
十六岁，1993年失踪

253
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,280
你找珍纳？
You looking for Janet?

254
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,880
你好，麦修太太？
Hello, Mrs. Mathews?

255
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,680
我叫汤姆贺特
我是州政府调查员
I'm Thomas Hart.
I'm a state-licensed investigator.

256
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,400
我受雇于美国资源中心
失踪人口部
I've been hired by the U.S.
Resource Centre, Missing Persons...

257
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,240
现在做内部资料调查
..as part of an internal audit.

258
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,320
我想跟你约个时间
I'd like to make an appointment
with you...

259
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,600
想问一些关于你女儿
玛丽 安的问题
...to answer questions
about your daughter, Mary Anne.

260
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:44,080
我昨天跟联邦调查局
的调查员….
I spoke to your FBI contact
yesterday, Agent....

261
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,840
尼尔，尼尔高？
Neil. Neil Cole?

262
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,320
对，高调查员，他说
会通知你我会来找你
Yes, Agent Cole. He told me he'd call
and let you know to expect me.

263
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,400
他没有通知你？
He didn't call?

264
00:21:59,160 --> 00:21:59,960
是你吗？
Is this you?

265
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:04,160
看来像五岁
You look about five years old.

266
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,520
不止五岁
A little older.

267
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,920
很可爱
Sweet.

268
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,840
最重要是….
It's important that...

269
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,440
你不要因我这次的查问
而提高你的期望
...you don't let this raise
your expectations.

270
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,920
也不会影响任何进行中的调查
It's not going to effect
any ongoing efforts.

271
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,720
我想说的是:
All I'm saying is, please know that...

272
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:24,680
我不是来带给你
任何虚假的希望
...I'm not here to create
any false hope.

273
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,600
我们一直在争吵，玛丽 安和我
We fought all the time,
Mary Anne and me...

274
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:33,120
和她的继父
...and her stepdad.

275
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,960
她憎恨他
She hated him...

276
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,360
因为他不是她的生父
...because he wasn't her real dad.

277
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,040
在家里和学校制造麻烦
Trouble here, trouble at school.

278
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,360
很麻烦
Trouble.

279
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,480
不喜欢规矩，像我一样
Didn't like rules.
Takes after me, I guess.

280
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,040
我从痛苦中学习
I had to learn the hard way.

281
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:52,400
我可以和你丈夫谈谈？
Can I speak to your husband?

282
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:53,560
她的继父？
Her stepfather?

283
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,880
大伟？
Dave?

284
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,400
死了
Gone.

285
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,120
是玛丽 安离家后两年
Two years after Mary Anne left.

286
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,640
她一直很憎恨他
All the time, she resented him.

287
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,640
我因为他而失去她
然后我又失去他
I lost her because of him,
and then I lost him.

288
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,480
现在只剩下我一个
I'm the only one still here.

289
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:12,720
玛丽 安有男朋友吗？
Did Mary have a boyfriend?

290
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,560
她有偷偷地和男孩子外出
She was sneaking out with someone.

291
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,920
她不会告诉我
She wouldn't tell me who.

292
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,560
满身吻痕的回家，向我说谎
Coming home with hickeys,
lying all the time.

293
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:26,680
我很抱歉向你提出
但在这种情况下
I am sorry to bring this up,
but in these circumstances...

294
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,600
加上有继父
...with the stepfather....

295
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:32,000
有没有任何被性侵犯的迹像？
Were there any indications
of any sort of abuse?

296
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:35,160
完全没有
警方和联邦调查局都问过
There was nothing like that.
The police and FBI asked.

297
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,440
没有这种事发生过，从来没有
Nothing happened like that.
Never.

298
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:38,760
如果有，她会告诉我
She'd have told me.

299
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,520
对不起，我一定要问
I apologize. I had to ask.

300
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,200
都是给她庆祝生日的
自从她离开后，每年一份
Those are for her birthday.
One for every year she missed.

301
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,120
都在等她回来
They'll be waiting for her
when she comes back.

302
00:23:52,120 --> 00:23:54,120
那是因为我打她巴掌
It's because I slapped her.

303
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,040
我知道
I know.

304
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:03,040
我们为了大卫吵架，她激怒了我
We was fighting about Dave,
and she was just pushing my buttons.

305
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,680
我便打她巴掌
And I slapped her.

306
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:07,800
天啊！
Jesus.

307
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
第二天，她便走了
Next day, she was gone.

308
00:24:11,800 --> 00:24:14,640
当孩子出走，他们
几乎都会留下字条
When kids run, they almost
always leave a note.

309
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,040
通常都会感到内疚
It's guilt, usually.

310
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:17,880
没有字条
There wasn't one.

311
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:19,480
警方查看过
Police looked.

312
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,200
诱拐和出走是两回事
An abduction's one thing,
a runaway's another.

313
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,800
有时候，离家出走都不是警方
优先处理的案件
Sometimes it's not the priority
for the police it should be.

314
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:30,240
没有留下任何东西
你不认为我会希望有吗？
There wasn't anything.
Don't you think I wish there was?

315
00:24:30,560 --> 00:24:33,160
你或许对，但你会让我看看吗？
You're probably right,
but would you let me look?

316
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,560
你告诉我….
You tell me...

317
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:38,880
不要存有太大希望
...not to get my hopes up...

318
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,480
也不要期望过高
...not to raise my expectations.

319
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,920
请自便
Go ahead.

320
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:49,920
我想喝点东西
I need a drink.

321
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,400
谢谢
Thank you.

322
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,680
亲爱的妈妈:假如你在看这信
Dear Mom: lf you're reading this...

323
00:26:42,920 --> 00:26:46,000
大概是因为
我从加州的好莱坞打电话来
...it probably means l called you
from Hollywood, California.

324
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:50,360
我留下日记是因为
我想你知道我为什么离开
l left my diary behind because
l want you to see why I'm leaving.

325
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,200
不是因为你打我
It's not because you hit me.

326
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,600
我藏起这信是不想让
大卫这王八找到
l hid this so Dave the dickhead
wouldn't find it.

327
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,960
我和华伦安迪生相爱
Warren Anderson and me
are in love.

328
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,440
我要和他开始新生活
I'm going to start
a whole new life with him.

329
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,600
华伦的父亲在镇上拥有一间车行
Warren's dad owns
that garage in town.

330
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,680
但华伦有更大的志愿
But Warren has even bigger plans.

331
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,880
华伦要成为动作电影的巨星
Warren'll become a star
in action movies.

332
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,880
他说我比很多电影里
的女孩子漂亮
He says I'm prettier
than a lot of girls in movies.

333
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,440
我也会成为巨星
I could be a star too.

334
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,280
要喝什么？
You want a drink?

335
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,280
当我们驶进好莱坞
When we cruise into Hollywood...

336
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:21,120
人人都感觉到我的眼睛在放光
因为我在恋爱中
...I'll have fiery eyes that everyone
will notice, because l am in love.

337
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,200
你对，我找不到任何资料
You were right.
I didn't find anything.

338
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,400
为你准备了饮料
Fixed you a drink.

339
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,040
不，谢了，我还有工作要做
Thanks, no.
I've got work to do.

340
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:33,120
我明天晚上再来
I'll stop by tomorrow night.

341
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:36,720
当你看这信时
我们可能已结婚了
We'll probably be married
by the time you read this.

342
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,080
不要来找我，因为我不会回去
Don't come looking for me,
because I'm not coming back.

343
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,480
不要来找我，因为我不会回去
Don't come looking for me,
because I'm not coming back.

344
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,400
或者有一天
你会在电视或杂志看到我
Maybe someday you'll see me
on TVor in magazines.

345
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,840
不要担心我，爱你的玛丽 安
Don't worry about me.
Love, Mary Anne.

346
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:49,920
安迪生先生？
Mr. Anderson?

347
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,160
哪一位？
Who's asking?

348
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:56,160
汤姆贺特，抱歉不能跟你握手
Tom Hart.
Excuse me not shaking hands.

349
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,240
我想找你儿子
你有个叫华伦的儿子，对不对？
I'm looking for your son.
You've got a son named Warren, right?

350
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,680
对
Sure.

351
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,080
有什么事？
What's it about?

352
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,440
你是警察？
You a cop?

353
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:06,600
不是
No, sir.

354
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,440
是他一位老朋友
其实是欠了他一点钱
Just a friend from a while back.
Owe him some money, actually.

355
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,840
你欠了他钱？
You owe him money?

356
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:14,440
这个倒新鲜
That's a new one.

357
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,760
如果你愿意你可以把钱交给我
You can leave it
right here if you want.

358
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,360
假如你不介意，我想寄给他
If it's all the same,
I'd like to send it to him.

359
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,360
加利福尼亚州，对不对？
California, right?

360
00:28:26,040 --> 00:28:27,600
加利福尼亚州？
California?

361
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,200
小子，你知道费亦威利监狱
在哪里吗？
Son, you know where
the Fayetteville lockup is?

362
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:34,680
华伦就在那里
That's where Warren is.

363
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,360
八个月的服刑期，入屋行窃罪
Doing eight months on a B and E.

364
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:41,880
谢谢
Thank you.

365
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:47,360
唔，我认识她
Yeah, man, I knew her.

366
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,200
在我去洛杉矶之前
已经把那贱妇甩掉
Dumped that bitch right
before I moved to L.A.

367
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:54,720
她来敲我门，像个他妈的贼婆娘
She shows up knocking at my door
like a fucking stalker.

368
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,400
我叫那贱妇去死
Told that bitch she could go to hell.

369
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,720
她去了哪里？
Where'd she go?

370
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,240
可能是地狱
Hell, maybe.

371
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:07,960
我不知道也没兴趣知道
I don't know and
I don't give a fuck either.

372
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,400
她说她可能去一些上空酒吧工作
She said she might work
at a titty bar or something.

373
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,480
其实她的胸并不迷人
Ask me, her tits
weren't all that great.

374
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,000
你有再见她吗？
Did you hear from her again?

375
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:24,320
不要以为我操她
就想她跟我去好莱坞
Just because I was fucking her
doesn't mean I wanted her out there.

376
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:28,240
她在好莱坞想成为巨星
She came to Hollywood to be
a big fucking movie star.

377
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:30,160
我也一样
And so did I.

378
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
这就是现在的我
Check me out now.

379
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,840
为什么不给我一枝烟？
Why don't you
pass me one of them smokes?

380
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,000
我不吸烟
I don't smoke.

381
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,840
你好吗？
How you doing?

382
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,200
还可以
I'm okay.

383
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,200
你听起来不是很好
You don't sound okay.

384
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,360
事情并不简单
It's not easy.

385
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,840
为什么？发生什么事
Why? What's going on?

386
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,880
只是比我想像的更困难
It's tougher than I thought
it would be, that's all.

387
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,360
是不是很辛苦？
Is it getting to you?

388
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,280
但我已有线索，不能放弃
l got a lead l can't drop.

389
00:30:06,440 --> 00:30:08,520
我差不多完成了，我想你
I'm almost done.
I miss you.

390
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,280
我也想你，我爱你
I miss you too.
I love you.

391
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,040
替我亲一下仙蒂？
Give Cindy a kiss for me, okay?

392
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:15,520
等一下，我想她要跟你说再见
跟爹地说再见
Wait, I think she wants to say bye.
Say bye to Daddy.

393
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,280
嗨，甜心
Hi, sweetie.

394
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,440
嗨，蜜糖儿
Hi, honey.

395
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,880
嗨，仙蒂
Hi, Cinderella.

396
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,480
她正在摸电话
She's touching the phone.

397
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:26,040
你应该看看她听见你声音时
的表情
You should see her face
at your voice.

398
00:30:26,560 --> 00:30:27,640
我爱你
I love you.

399
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,200
我也爱你，再见
I love you too. Bye.

400
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,800
我正在做晚餐
I was just making dinner.

401
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,080
不知不觉地做了两人的份量
I've made enough for two,
as it happens.

402
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,240
对不起，我不能留下
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

403
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:44,080
我只想让你知道
我跟我部门的人谈过
I wanted to let you know
I spoke to my people at the agency.

404
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:47,320
我叫他们继续调查玛丽 安的案件
I told them to keep
Mary Anne's case active.

405
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,920
那….
Well...

406
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:53,920
起码，喝点东西
..stay for a drink, at least.

407
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,400
你肯定肚子不饿？
You sure you're not hungry?

408
00:30:59,680 --> 00:31:02,680
偶尔吃一顿不看电视
的晚餐也不错
It'd be nice to have a meal
without the TV on for once.

409
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:05,160
我要开长途车
I have a long drive ahead of me.

410
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,320
一个人吃晚餐是最令人沮丧的事
It's one of the most
depressing things. Eating alone.

411
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,680
我不知道为什么
你以为我应该已经习惯了
I don't know why. You'd think
I'd be used to it by now.

412
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,120
麦修太太
Mrs. Mathews?

413
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:26,520
珍纳
Janet.

414
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,440
你从来有没有想过
Do you ever consider....

415
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,760
有没有想过玛丽 安
可能永远不回来了？
Do you realize that
Mary may never come back?

416
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,360
我每天都在想
I think about it every day.

417
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,600
每一次电话响
Every time the phone rings...

418
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:42,200
每一次，我都以为是她
...every time, I still think it's her.

419
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,200
她是我唯一所想的
She's all I think about.

420
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,640
你能告诉我
Can you tell me...

421
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:53,280
假如你要作出抉择
假如一定要你选择
...if you had to make a choice,
if you were forced to choose...

422
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:57,200
一是幻想她在外面某处
...between imagining her
out there somewhere...

423
00:31:57,400 --> 00:32:00,560
过着很好的生活，很快乐
...living a good life, being happy...

424
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,640
但你不知道
...but you don't know...

425
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,160
永远不会知道
...you never find out...

426
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,720
或是最坏的事实
...or the worst being true...

427
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,160
她已死了
...her being gone...

428
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:15,080
但你知道
...but you know.

429
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,640
你终于知道
You finally know...

430
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,800
她发生什么事
...what's happened to her.

431
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,160
我会怎样选？
What would I choose?

432
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
对
Yes.

433
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,480
我会选择去知道
I would choose to know.

434
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,160
我需要知道
I need to know.

435
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:46,920
对不起，我想借用你的洗手间
Excuse me,
I have to use your restroom.

436
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,480
你要走了
You're leaving.

437
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:50,080
如果我有任何发现，我会通知你
I'll call you if I find anything out.

438
00:34:12,080 --> 00:34:16,360
好莱坞

439
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,600
脱衣
舞娘

440
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,480
成人书店

441
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:34,200
你好吗？
How you doing?

442
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,400
今晚有约会？
Big date tonight?

443
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,960
嗯，有可能
Yeah, guess so.

444
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,920
有没有兴趣看一个电动阴道？
Could I interest you
in a battery-operated vagina?

445
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,720
很诱惑，但不用了，谢谢
It's tempting, but no thanks.

446
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:48,400
我不想看到
当你需要一个电动阴道
I'd hate to see you caught in
one of those everyday situations...

447
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,920
而你没有的情况
...that calls for a battery-operated
vagina and you don't have one.

448
00:36:52,120 --> 00:36:53,480
我宁愿冒个险
I'll risk it.

449
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,000
没问题，一共是七十四元五毛八
All right, your total
is ＄7 4.58 please.

450
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:03,000
一百元
A hundred.

451
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:11,920
廿五元和零钱
Total's ＄25 and some change.

452
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,080
多谢你光临成人书店
I'd like to thank you
for shopping at Adult Bookstore.

453
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,800
祝你有精彩的一天
And have yourself a fabulous day.

454
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,680
你在看什么？
What are you reading?

455
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:24,600
后庭花

456
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,280
很讨好的书名
你真正在看的是什么书？
Catchy title.
What are you really reading?

457
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:30,520
很难相信这本书
有任何值得强调的部份
Hard to believe it's got
any parts worth highlighting.

458
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:33,800
冷血杀戮

459
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,520
卡波特
Capote.

460
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,760
你知道是怎样
You know how it is.

461
00:37:39,440 --> 00:37:42,800
你不想在顾客面前
令自己尴尬
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
in front of your fellow perverts.

462
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:47,120
没错，我会被色情行业协会轰走
I might get drummed out
of the pornographers' union.

463
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:48,800
那我靠什么生活？
Where would I be then?

464
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:53,560
祝今天愉快
Have a good day.

465
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:09,400
性爱不设防
性爱最过瘾

466
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,560
嗨，你好吗？
How are you?

467
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,240
嗨，蜜糖儿
Hey, honey.

468
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,480
-你好吗？
-我有一点累
-How you doing?
-I'm a little beat.

469
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:27,520
仙蒂怎样？
How's Cindy?

470
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,640
她很乖，她想念你
She's sweet. She misses you.

471
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:31,400
进展如何？
How's it going?

472
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,400
调查并不算很顺利
我现在只想着回家
The way things are going,
I'm thinking about coming home.

473
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:36,760
真的？
Really?

474
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,760
蜜糖儿，等一等
Honey, wait.

475
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,200
我再打给你好吗？
Can I call you back?

476
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:47,600
我答应马上打给你
再见，蜜糖儿
I'll call you right back, l promise.
Bye, honey.

477
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,880
柯太太，一共有三个人
Mrs. Christian, there were 3 men.

478
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:34,720
不单是那摄影师和戴面具的人
Not just the cameraman
and the masked man.

479
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,240
我发现有第三个人在看
l caught a glimpse of a third man.
He was watching.

480
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:42,560
我会从电脑放大出一个
比较清楚的影像
I'll try to get a clearer image
through computer enhancement.

481
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:45,960
但这可能发生在六年前的事
所以并不是….
But this probably happened
6 years ago, so it's not--

482
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,080
好的，我会尽力
All right, I'll keep trying.

483
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,240
谢谢，我谢谢你的支持
Thank you.
l appreclate your support.

484
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,240
再见
Goodbye.

485
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:55,400
经过我们137个工作小时
What we have here is
1 37 billable man-hours...

486
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:58,240
加上一部超过十万元的机器
...a hundred-plus thousand
dollars machine...

487
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,000
得到的结果就是
...and the result is a...

488
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,080
一个放大了的男人头的背后
...fully rasterised enhancement
of the back of some guy's head.

489
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,480
要不要裱起它？
Want it framed?

490
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:10,320
好的，祝你好运
There you go. Have a nice day.

491
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:15,320
这里像加油站
加油前要先付款
It's like a gas station,
you pay before you pump.

492
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:17,840
记得我吗？
Remember me?

493
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,280
终于回来买那电动阴道
Came back for the battery-operated
vagina after all.

494
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,600
我想要一些资料，或者你能帮我
I need information.
Maybe you could help.

495
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,680
汤姆魏斯，照片很漂亮
Thomas Welles. Nice picture.

496
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:33,600
哪一种资料？因为我有各方面的
What sort of information?
Because I got all different kinds.

497
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:35,000
我会付钱的那种
The kind I'll pay for.

498
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:38,280
我不知道你在找哪一种….
I don't know
what you're looking for...

499
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,680
但我要先跟你说清楚
我是异性恋者
...so we're clear from the start,
I'm straight.

500
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,040
恭喜你
Congratulations.

501
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,320
谢谢
Thank you.

502
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:44,600
拉上拉链！
Zip it!

503
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,120
我可以提供资料
I can hook you up.

504
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,200
你说出要我做的，我说出价钱
You name the vice,
I name the price.

505
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:50,300
你在这里工作了多久？
How long you been working here?

506
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:52,220
大约两年
Almost two years.

507
00:40:52,460 --> 00:40:54,660
你叫什么名字？
如果你不介意我问
What's your name,
if you don't mind me asking?

508
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,300
麦克斯
Max.

509
00:40:57,740 --> 00:40:58,660
这是我们的交易
Here's the deal.

510
00:40:58,940 --> 00:41:01,740
我正在调查有关地下色情行业
This thing I'm on now has to do
with underground pornography.

511
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:04,740
非法在台底交易的那种东西
Stuff that's sold under
the counter, illegally.

512
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:07,140
没有什么非法的东西
There's not much illegal out there.

513
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:10,980
不管有多少
我都要知道，要查清楚
Whatever there is, I want to know.
I want a good look.

514
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:14,820
如果你有这些门路，很好
如果没有，请你立刻说
So if you've got that kind of
connection, great. If not, speak now.

515
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,820
你是警察？
You're not a cop, are you?

516
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:19,340
如果你是，你必须告诉我
If I ask and you are,
you got to tell me.

517
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,020
我不是警察
I'm not a cop.

518
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:23,180
私家侦探？
A private detective?

519
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,820
像夏飞特？
Like Shaft?

520
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:28,380
有否看过私家真棒？
我有减价发售
You ever seen Private Dicks?
I got it on sale.

521
00:41:28,620 --> 00:41:30,260
你在这里赚多少钱？
How much you make in there?

522
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,260
约四百元一个星期，不用交税
Around 400 bucks a week,
off the books.

523
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,780
假设我生活在
与你相同的幻想世界
Let's pretend I live
in the same fantasy world...

524
00:41:38,940 --> 00:41:41,140
而你在这垃圾地方
每星期赚四百元
...where you make ＄400
a week in that dump.

525
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,620
我给你五百元工作几天
I'll give you 500 for a few days.

526
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:45,060
六百吧，阿伯
Six sounds good, Pops.

527
00:41:45,300 --> 00:41:46,460
五百
Five.

528
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:49,740
这是我的电话号码
Here's my number.

529
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:55,500
你何时可以开始？
When can you start?

530
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:58,700
嗯，明天晚上我很晚下班
Well, tomorrow night I get off late.

531
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:00,700
明天见
Tomorrow.

532
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:01,780
好吧
All right.

533
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:04,940
不要叫我阿伯
And don't call me Pops.

534
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,860
当然，我不想伤害你的感情
Of course not. I wouldn't
want to hurt your feelings.

535
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,220
我不知道你的性趣
Look, l don't know
what your scene is.

536
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,300
你可能和其他人一样喜欢色情
You may like porn
as much as the next guy.

537
00:42:15,460 --> 00:42:17,740
但你不太像一般喜欢这玩意的人
But you don't look
like your average sleaze.

538
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,220
反而像个警察
More like your average fucking cop.

539
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:23,980
所以当你问及那些
非法的东西的时候
So when you ask people about fucking
illegal stuff, it has a certain...

540
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,220
你有种特别的神情
...patina to it.

541
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,380
神情
Patina.

542
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:28,620
那是卡波特词语
懂吗？
It's a Truman Capote word.
Hello?

543
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,700
如果从没人看过
或卖过这类电影
If someone never saw
or sold a snuff film...

544
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,660
他们不会在乎我问什么
...they shouldn't care
what I ask.

545
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,820
如果他们有，就会比较紧张
If they have,
they should be nervous.

546
00:42:34,980 --> 00:42:37,700
只要你觉得谁有嫌疑
不要放弃
Whoever acts insulted,
keep knocking on their door.

547
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,860
这，阿伯，现在改变初衷
还不是太迟
Look, Pops, it's not too late
to change your mind about all this.

548
00:42:42,060 --> 00:42:44,900
你将会见到一些
你不忘记的东西
There's things you're going
to see that you can't unsee.

549
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,740
会让你印象很深刻
They get in your head and stay there.

550
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,500
你怎知道我看过什么？
How do you know what I've seen?

551
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,020
那很好，但每个人都有他的极限
Okay, fine.
But everybody's got their limit.

552
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:55,700
我在这里呆了他妈的六年
尝试发展我的音乐事业
I've been here 6 fucking years
trying to get my music together.

553
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,500
所以我开始兼职以维持生计
So I start part-time
where I work to make ends meet.

554
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:03,180
一晃眼，几年光景过去
我仍是老样子
And boom, a couple years go by,
and here I am.

555
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:07,100
只是说，在你发觉以前
你已经成为这行业的一份子
I'm just saying, before you know it,
you're in it. Deep in it.

556
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,980
别为我担心
Don't worry about me.

557
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:10,180
谢谢你
But thank you.

558
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:12,100
别客气
You're welcome.

559
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,700
阿伯，你在和魔鬼共舞
魔鬼不会改变
Pops, you dance with the devil,
the devil don't change.

560
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,780
魔鬼会改变你
Devil changes you.

561
00:43:18,180 --> 00:43:19,460
你歌词的部份？
Some of your lyrics?

562
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:20,540
很好笑
That's cute.

563
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:33,980
这地方已存在约有三年
This place has been around
about 3 years...

564
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,460
但他们不断搬来搬去
...but they keep moving it
house to house.

565
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:54,980
这只是一小部份
This is the tip of the iceberg.

566
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,060
有很多墨西哥性虐待
有很多亚洲性奴
Lots of Mexican S & M,
lots of Asian bondage...

567
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,820
各种的兽行，如果你有兴趣的话
...all kinds of bestiality,
if you're into that.

568
00:44:01,740 --> 00:44:03,820
别碰任何东西
想要什么，告诉飞弟
Don't touch nothing.
You want something, tell Friendly.

569
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:05,220
问他看看？
Ask him.

570
00:44:17,740 --> 00:44:18,900
别这样！
Don't do that!

571
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,580
好了！没事！
All right! It's cool!

572
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,780
没问题？
All right? Okay.

573
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,580
走吧，好的
Come on, let's go.
All right!

574
00:44:38,100 --> 00:44:41,020
你是不是一个法律执行人
或与法律执行有关？
Are you a law enforcement agent
or affillated with law enforcement?

575
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,580
操你，赖瑞
Fuck you, Larry.

576
00:44:42,820 --> 00:44:46,860
你是否一个法律执行人
或与法律执行有关？
Are you a law enforcement agent,
or affillated with law enforcement?

577
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:48,300
操你，赖瑞
Fuck you, Lar.

578
00:44:48,540 --> 00:44:50,420
你越来越上道了，魏斯
You're getting cool there, Welles.

579
00:44:50,660 --> 00:44:54,460
这里有你那色情电影的怪人
卖那些烫手货的人
You got your porn zombies here.
Junkies for the hard stuff.

580
00:44:54,620 --> 00:44:56,860
但这种地下室销售不会维持很久
But these basement sales
won't last much longer.

581
00:44:57,100 --> 00:44:59,260
一，太冒险
二，所有东西都上网
One, it's too risky.
And two, everything's on the Net.

582
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:01,780
嫖客在网上交换照片
Chicken hawks swapping photos
with their modems.

583
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:05,620
分类广告有密码
Then there's classified ads
with hidden codes, secret couriers...

584
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:07,860
由假的公司秘密递送
...wires through dummy corporations.

585
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:11,300
有什么不合法的
顾客都跑得远远的
If something's illegal, the buyers
are as far away as they can get.

586
00:45:11,500 --> 00:45:14,460
大家互不认识，你明白我说什么
Nobody knows what nobody knows,
you know what I mean?

587
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,300
你好吗，山美？
How's it going, Samuel?

588
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:22,540
我去跟她打招呼
I'm going to say hi to her.

589
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:24,980
你好吗？我喜欢
How are you? I love that.

590
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,820
是有拉链的麦克杰克森像
It's the Michael Jackson look,
with the zippers.

591
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,660
儿童

592
00:46:00,020 --> 00:46:01,580
这是什么？
What are these?

593
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:04,340
极度性奴
Extreme bondage.

594
00:46:04,660 --> 00:46:06,260
强奸电影
Rape films.

595
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:08,860
恶心到极点
Sick shit.

596
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:11,860
买五送一
Buy five, get one for free.

597
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:15,180
有没有更精彩的？
Anything harder?

598
00:46:15,420 --> 00:46:17,700
没有更精彩的
There's nothing harder.

599
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:19,620
色情暴力电影？
Snuff?

600
00:46:22,540 --> 00:46:25,020
没有这种电影
There's no such thing as snuff.

601
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:27,700
先生，你看到的就是我所有的
What you see is what I got, mister.

602
00:46:27,940 --> 00:46:30,020
我在哪里可以找到？
我有很多钱
Do you know where I can get some?
I have a lot of money.

603
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:31,860
操你
Fuck off.

604
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:21,340
就是她
There she is.

605
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:24,580
就是她，“重掴桃乐菲”
It's Double Slap Dorothy.

606
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:27,180
这个女人可以成为垒球员
There's one chick that
could be a baseball player.

607
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,260
她的臂力很惊人
The swing on her is unreal.

608
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:33,940
有些色情暴力电影
是界乎于三级片与暴力之间
Some of these S & M and bondage films
you'll see straddle the line.

609
00:47:34,100 --> 00:47:35,860
恋足狂，集体性交
Foot fetish, orgies, shit films...

610
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:38,700
雌雄同体，伤残
比三级片更精彩
...hermaphrodites, mutilation.
It's harder than hard-core.

611
00:47:38,860 --> 00:47:40,100
但大部份是合法
But mostly legal.

612
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,180
阴茎
Stick.

613
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:42,780
有人见到觉得呕心
One guy sees it and pukes.

614
00:47:42,940 --> 00:47:45,940
有人见到却爱到死
Another guy sees it
and he falls in love.

615
00:47:46,940 --> 00:47:49,940
这是我跟你提的那个人
你有带子吗？
This is the guy I was telling you about.
You got the tapes?

616
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:52,260
一千元
A thousand bucks.

617
00:47:52,460 --> 00:47:54,780
-一千二佰元两盒
-你对麦克斯说一千
-1 200 for the two.
-You told Max 1 000.

618
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:59,300
我知道，但这个更有趣
我抬高价钱，你就会不爽
I know, but this is more fun. I raise
the price, and you get pissed off.

619
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,940
-我以为我们已经说好
-那是真的吗？
-I thought we had a relationship.
-Is it real?

620
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:04,940
从来没见过这样恶心的
Sickest shit you'll ever see.

621
00:48:09,980 --> 00:48:10,980
是真的吗？
Is that real?

622
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,460
看起来他妈的是真的
That sure as shit looks real.

623
00:48:21,980 --> 00:48:23,820
她没有了呼吸
She's not breathing.

624
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:34,660
这影片是谁制作？
Who makes these films?

625
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,300
我不知道
I don't know.

626
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,660
好像是菲律宾人
Looks like the Philippines.

627
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,140
对，肯定是菲律宾人
Yeah, definitely the Philippines.

628
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:11,860
等等，是同一个女孩
Wait a minute.
That's the same girl.

629
00:49:12,020 --> 00:49:13,500
是同一个女孩吗？
Isn't that the same girl?

630
00:49:13,860 --> 00:49:14,940
看
Look.

631
00:49:16,540 --> 00:49:17,860
是同一个女孩
It is the same.

632
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,180
那是假的
They're fakes.

633
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:23,460
真棒
That's great.

634
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:28,300
残杀2：重生
Snuff 2: The Resurrection.

635
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:29,940
我的天
Oh, boy.

636
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:32,780
付1200元，你期望什么？
Well, what do you expect for 1 200?

637
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:38,060
你想喝点啤酒或什么？
我想喝点酒精饮料
You want a beer or something?
I could use anything.

638
00:49:39,700 --> 00:49:42,980
对不起，我要告诉你
色情暴力电影是不存在的
But I'm sorry, man.
I told you snuff was bogus.

639
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:45,980
我希望我有替你拿收据
I just wish I would have
gotten you a receipt.

640
00:49:46,620 --> 00:49:47,780
“重重一击”
''Hard Spank.''

641
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:50,380
“麦克斯加利福尼亚”
''Max California.''

642
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:52,540
那是我以前的乐队
That's my old band.

643
00:49:52,820 --> 00:49:54,140
我们已拆伙了
We broke up.

644
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:55,380
什么时候？
When?

645
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:57,540
大约一年前
Maybe about a year ago.

646
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:01,220
我不是想侮辱你
I don't mean any offense...

647
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:04,060
但你在这行业里混什么？
...but what are you doing
mixed up in all this?

648
00:50:04,820 --> 00:50:07,740
我并没有在混什么，阿伯
I'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.

649
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:10,740
你让我觉得你很聪明
可以做其他的事
You strike me as being smart enough
to do something else.

650
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:12,660
谢谢
Thanks.

651
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,420
我希望你拥有一间唱片公司
I wish you owned a record label.

652
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,740
起码比在加油站工作好得多
Look, it beats pumping gas.

653
00:50:19,420 --> 00:50:21,820
但自己不买，也不赞同
I don't buy it.
I don't endorse it.

654
00:50:22,660 --> 00:50:23,900
我只是指点客人迷津
I just point the way.

655
00:50:25,260 --> 00:50:26,900
但你说这让你沮丧
You said it gets to you.

656
00:50:27,180 --> 00:50:28,500
嗯，该死的，可以这么说！
Well, hell, yeah!

657
00:50:28,740 --> 00:50:31,180
我每天看到多少痞子？
Parade of losers I see every day?

658
00:50:31,420 --> 00:50:33,260
我有什么选择？
What choices have I got?

659
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:37,580
音乐界并没有真正敲我的门
The music industry is not exactly
beating down my door.

660
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,500
你呢，汤魏斯？
And what about you, Tom Welles?

661
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:45,260
你戴有戒指，你有小孩？
You got a ring on your finger.
You got kids?

662
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:46,940
一个女儿
A daughter.

663
00:50:48,700 --> 00:50:50,940
那你有一位太太和一个女儿
So you got a wife and a daughter...

664
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:53,100
和一间不错的小黄屋
...and a nice little yellow house...

665
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:55,260
和一只狗
...and a dog named Shep.

666
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:57,940
那你在这里做什么？
What the hell are you doing here?

667
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,300
问得好
Good question.

668
00:51:05,100 --> 00:51:07,140
你在像今晚的地方
感到兴奋吗？
Do you get turned on
at places like tonight?

669
00:51:09,060 --> 00:51:10,300
我没有
No, I am not.

670
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,780
你也不会完全没感觉
You don't exactly
get turned off, either.

671
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:17,300
魔鬼已经在改变你
Devil's changing you already.

672
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,380
晚安，麦克斯
Good night, Max.

673
00:51:48,820 --> 00:51:50,740

认得这位少女

She didn't return one night.
Do you know what happened to her?

Not yet, but I'm looking

Could you get
that flowered one down for me?

682
00:52:25,020 --> 00:52:26,380
这是她的箱子

我已经忘记了
直到你给我看她的照片

684
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:34,540
我希望她会回来
I suppose I always
hoped she'd be back.

685

她好像很迷失

之后，我只能祈祷
她有更好的出路
After a time, all I could do was pray
she'd moved on to better things.

687
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:42,860
你能把这个拿给她的家人吗？
Can you get this suitcase
to her people?

你卖他妈的什么？
What kind of shit are you peddling?

719
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,340
我的带子很受欢迎
他们很喜欢
Come on. My tapes sell.
People eat the shit up.

720
00:56:42,580 --> 00:56:45,340

You know how bad it has to be
for some jackass to come back...

找些还有牙齿的女孩

这里有啤酒
There's a case of beer in there.

00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,060
人到齐，除了那其中一个少女

01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:16,860
我什么都知道
I know all about it.

738
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,460
嗯，你知道什么？
Yeah, you know about what?

739
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:20,220
关于那女孩
About that girl...

740
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,300
六年前
...six years ago.

741
01:00:22,980 --> 01:00:24,780
我知道你对她做过什么
I know what you did to her.

742
01:00:25,980 --> 01:00:27,140
你是谁？
Who is this?

743
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,820
你杀了她
You murdered her.

744
01:00:29,300 --> 01:00:31,220
你和你的朋友
You and your friends.

745
01:00:32,220 --> 01:00:34,540
我不知道你他妈的说什么
l don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

746
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:36,060
你在影片里杀死她
You killed her on film.

747
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,820
现在你有麻烦
And now you're fucked.You're all fucked.

748
01:00:37,980 --> 01:00:39,820
你们全部有麻烦
You're all fucked.

749
01:00:54,260 --> 01:00:55,580
快点
Come on.

750
01:01:01,900 --> 01:01:03,820
快点，给我一点线索，爱迪
Come on, give me something, Eddie.

751
01:01:16,700 --> 01:01:17,860
是我
It's me.

752
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,180
你有什么事？
What do you want?

753
01:01:20,340 --> 01:01:21,780
我刚接到个电话
Look, l just got a phone call.

754
01:01:21,940 --> 01:01:24,700
我们要谈谈
但不方便在电话里谈
We got to talk.
And we can't talk on the phone.

755
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:27,860
所以我们其中一个需要坐上飞机
So one of us
has to get on a plane, all right?

756
01:01:28,020 --> 01:01:31,020
去你的，你这神经过敏的疯子
Blow me, you paranoid fuck.

757
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,300
他妈的
Fuck! Fuck!

758
01:01:46,780 --> 01:01:49,140
你喜欢看，你这神经过敏的疯子
So you like to watch, paranoid fuck.

759
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:00,300
电话是登记在
曼哈顿帝诺伟域的名下
Phone is listed under ''D. Velvet''
in Manhattan.

760
01:02:00,540 --> 01:02:01,460
帝诺伟域
Dino Velvet.

761
01:02:01,620 --> 01:02:04,900
他是制片人/导演/怪人
He's a producer/director/weirdo.

762
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:06,740
他像性虐待的贾慕思
He's like the Jim Jarmusch of S & M.

763
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:08,220
他的作品有多刺激？
How hard is his stuff?

764
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,660
你想有多刺激？
How hard do you want it?

765
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,900
性奴，恋物狂，诡异香辣片

766
01:02:12,140 --> 01:02:13,580
肯定不是给神经质看的
Definitely not for the squeamish.

767
01:02:13,740 --> 01:02:15,300
并不容易找得到
It's kind of hard to come by.

768
01:02:15,580 --> 01:02:18,060
通常透过性杂志封底订购
Mostly out of the back
of bondage magazines.

769
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:19,660
但他有崇拜者
But he's got fans.

770
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,260
我认识一个人
认为那是艺术
This guy I know, he thinks it's art.

771
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:25,820
他告诉我，如果有足够的钱
伟域会受托拍电影的
He's told me Velvet will do
commissions if there's enough dough.

772
01:02:26,060 --> 01:02:27,980
刚好在合法与不合法的边缘
Nothing illegal, but borderline.

773
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:31,180
如果有人想看一个穿潜水衣
的人妖
If a guy wants to see
a transvestite in a rubber suit--

774
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:32,580
我明白
I got the picture.

775
01:02:32,740 --> 01:02:34,900
麦克斯，进来
Max, get in here!

776
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:37,340
那….
So...

777
01:02:37,500 --> 01:02:39,020
你要去纽约吗？
...you're going to New York?

778
01:02:39,260 --> 01:02:40,500
可能
Maybe.

779
01:02:41,180 --> 01:02:42,940
你这个样子
Looking like that.

780
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:44,940
你会需要我
You'll need me.

781
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:48,500
我认识这人，范炽
他不仅是伟域电影迷那么简单
This guy I know, Frenchie, is more
than just a fan of Velvet films.

782
01:02:48,780 --> 01:02:50,420
如果你想，我可以带你去
I could get you in if you want.

783
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:52,500
当然要多点钱
For more money, of course.

784
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:55,620
还有出差费，我要坐头等
Plus expenses. I fly first class.

785
01:02:55,780 --> 01:02:57,420
我们何时出发？
So when are we leaving?

786
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:03,780
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

787
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,100
哗，这是我第一次来纽约
Man, my first time in
the Big Bad Apple.

788
01:03:10,780 --> 01:03:12,780
不要拍我
I told you, don't film me.

789
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,620
好，霍华休斯
Fine, Howard Hughes.

790
01:03:25,700 --> 01:03:28,140
你没告诉我会这样豪华
You didn't say it was going to be
this luxurious.

791
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,380
这是总统套房
It's the Presidential suite.

792
01:03:29,540 --> 01:03:31,540
你有令人舒服的幽默感
You have a comforting
sense of humour.

793
01:03:31,820 --> 01:03:33,660
我在隔壁几间房
I'll be a couple of doors down.

794
01:03:33,820 --> 01:03:36,820
汤姆，我不知为什么要住
这种廉价旅馆
Tom, I don't know why
we're staying in this fleabag.

795
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,300
在廉价旅馆
人们才不会管闲事
People mind
their own business in fleabags.

796
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,740
我现在出去一会
你找一下伟域的录影带
I'm going out. Dig up
whatever Velvet tapes you can find.

797
01:03:42,900 --> 01:03:43,740
拿收据
Get receipts.

798
01:03:45,220 --> 01:03:46,420
知道
Yes, sir.

799
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:50,660
我丈夫有五个现金户口
My husband had
five cash accounts he used.

800
01:03:50,820 --> 01:03:52,420
在1992年
Between November...

801
01:03:52,660 --> 01:03:54,340
十一月
...of 1 992...

802
01:03:54,980 --> 01:03:56,340
到1993年的
...and March...

803
01:03:56,580 --> 01:03:58,820
三月之间
...of 1 993...

804
01:03:58,980 --> 01:04:02,820
他从每一个户口
开出一张现金支票
...he wrote one check
out to cash from each account.

805
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:07,260
我丈夫从来不亲自处理钱的事
My husband never dealt with money
personally.

806
01:04:07,500 --> 01:04:09,100
尤其是现金
Certainly not cash.

807
01:04:09,260 --> 01:04:12,180
这五张支票的总数很惊人
These checks he wrote
are for very odd amounts.

808
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:13,660
全部加起来
When totaled together...

809
01:04:13,940 --> 01:04:15,580
这五张支票
...the five checks...

810
01:04:15,860 --> 01:04:18,100
从五个不同的户口提取了
...from the five different accounts...

811
01:04:18,340 --> 01:04:20,700
总共一百万
...they equal ＄1 million.

812
01:04:21,340 --> 01:04:23,500
柯太太，那很有趣
That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.

813
01:04:23,700 --> 01:04:25,780
我提及这是因为
I only mentioned this because...

814
01:04:26,020 --> 01:04:29,020
你叫我看看有什么
不寻常的地方
...you asked me to look
for anything unusual.

815
01:04:29,260 --> 01:04:31,780
我现在剩下五千元现金
I've got about ＄5,000 left in cash.

816
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:35,700
如果你批准我跟你提出的计划
我还需要五万元
I'll need another 50, if you approve
the plan I mentioned earlier.

817
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:39,540
我快可辨认出那戴面具
男人的身份了
I'm very close to establishing
the identity of the man in the mask.

818
01:04:39,700 --> 01:04:41,940
我会叫龙雕先生安排
I'll have Mr. Longdale arrange it.

819
01:04:42,100 --> 01:04:43,860
怎样交给你？
How will l get it to you?

820
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:46,300
如果你有笔，我给你地址
If you have a pen,
I'll give you the address.

821
01:04:46,540 --> 01:04:49,980
欢迎来到帝诺伟域的世界
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

822
01:05:22,140 --> 01:05:25,660
欢迎来到帝诺伟域的世界
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

823
01:05:53,420 --> 01:05:56,100
他是谁？戴面具的，他是谁？
Who is this? In the mask, who is he?

824
01:05:57,260 --> 01:05:59,100
来吧，醒醒，他是谁？
Come on, wake up. Who is this?

825
01:05:59,340 --> 01:06:03,020
是帝诺常用的疯子
他常常出现在帝诺的电影里
One of the lunatics Dino always uses.

他叫什么名字？
What's his name?

827
01:06:04,380 --> 01:06:07,100
不知道，这是他的特点
I don't know. That's his whole thing.

828
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,460
他经常戴面具

830
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:12,860
不，是“机器”

831
01:06:13,460 --> 01:06:15,540
他叫自己“机器”

832
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:19,460
他是个工作狂
He's a lover, man.

833
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:22,700
他绝对热爱他的工作

for a living.

834
01:06:23,700 --> 01:06:25,780
我希望我也可以这样说你
I wish I could say the same about you.

835
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:37,980
是，是
Yes, yes.

836
01:06:39,740 --> 01:06:42,580
我可以感觉到他们
非常欣赏我的风格
I can see they
really appreclate my style here.

837
01:06:42,740 --> 01:06:45,500
我可以马上跟群众打成一片
I kind of blend in with the crowd here.

838
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:46,740
可能你没留意
If you didn't notice.

839
01:06:46,980 --> 01:06:49,300
像这里的女士
她们喜欢我的风格
Like these ladies here,
they like my style.

840
01:06:55,060 --> 01:06:55,900
这是谁？
Who is it?

841
01:06:56,140 --> 01:06:58,060
麦克斯加利福尼亚
Yes, this is Max California.

842
01:06:58,340 --> 01:07:00,980
我打过电话来
我是范炽在洛杉矶的朋友
I called earlier.
I'm a friend of Frenchie's from L.A.

843
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:04,180
我和我的合伙人想见伟域先生
My partner and I
would like to speak to Mr. Velvet.

844
01:07:04,340 --> 01:07:05,660
他不在这里
He's not here.

845
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:08,500
我们有一笔钱给他
We're here to give him
a large sum of money.

846
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:10,180
如果没兴趣
我们就走了
If he's not interested, we'll split.

847
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:30,780
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talk about.

848
01:07:30,940 --> 01:07:34,460
你能回答我的简单问题吗？
Can't you just answer
my simple question?

849
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:39,700
我问你，罗拉他妈的在哪里？！
I asked you a question!
Where the fuck is Laura?!

850
01:07:40,100 --> 01:07:42,940
那是我过去十分钟
一直问你的问题
That's what I've been asking you
the last 1 0 minutes.

851
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:45,620
请坐，不要客气
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

852
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:47,220
你这呆子！
You idiot!

853
01:07:47,460 --> 01:07:49,460
两天后拍摄？
Going to shoot in two days?

854
01:07:49,700 --> 01:07:51,980
喂，你在乱花我的钱
Man, you're spending my money.

855
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:54,140
嗯，你最好这样
Yeah, you better do that.

856
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:56,460
操你的
Fucking asshole.

857
01:07:56,700 --> 01:07:59,460
很荣幸认识你
谢谢你接见我们
It's an honour to meet you.
Thank you for seeing us.

858
01:08:00,980 --> 01:08:02,140
天啊
God.

859
01:08:04,820 --> 01:08:06,540
那，我可以有什么效劳？
So, what can I do you for?

860
01:08:06,820 --> 01:08:11,740
我们想委托你制作一套影片
一套独一无二的帝诺伟域影片
We'd like to commission a film.
A Dino Velvet original, one of a kind.

861
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,580
对
That's right.

862
01:08:14,060 --> 01:08:16,300
我很崇拜你
I'm a huge admirer of yours.

863
01:08:16,580 --> 01:08:18,820
天，我爱被人捧
God, I love flattery.

864
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:22,420
你是个天才，伟域先生
一个不可多得的天才
You're a genius, Mr. Velvet.
A goddamn genius.

865
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:24,900
唯一仍然用底片拍成录影带
The only one still transferring film
to video.

866
01:08:25,060 --> 01:08:28,260
再没有人欣赏这种诚意
Nobody really appreclates
that kind of integrity anymore.

867
01:08:28,500 --> 01:08:30,980
你电影所表现的狂妄气质
The grain and the gritty look you get.

868
01:08:34,340 --> 01:08:35,660
那套是你的至爱？
Which is your favourite?

869
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:37,340
如果我要选
If I had to choose...

870
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:39,340
那一定是窒息或魔鬼
...it'd be Choke or Devil.

871
01:08:40,100 --> 01:08:41,260
那种潜意识意像
The subliminal imagery...

872
01:08:41,420 --> 01:08:44,260
在窒息里真正令你毛骨悚然
...in Choke is what
really gets under your skin.

873
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:49,420
而魔鬼令我害怕也令我兴奋
Well, Devil frightened me
as much as it excited me...

874
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:52,340
但很难去选一套最爱
...but I'd be hard-pressed
to choose a favourite.

875
01:08:56,940 --> 01:08:59,780
预算是多少？
What kind of a budget
are we talking about?

876
01:09:00,860 --> 01:09:02,540
预付五千
Five thousand now.

877
01:09:03,460 --> 01:09:05,020
完成后再付五千
Five thousand upon delivery.

878
01:09:05,380 --> 01:09:07,620
两个女人，一个黑，一个白
Two women. One white, one black.

879
01:09:08,020 --> 01:09:10,020
性奴，当然
Hard bondage, of course.

880
01:09:10,460 --> 01:09:12,300
除了这，我信任….
Other than that, trusting your...

881
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,540
你的艺术表达
...artistic interpretation...

882
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:17,140
我只有两个条件
...I only have two stipulations.

883
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:23,460
尽管说
Challenge me.

884
01:09:25,140 --> 01:09:26,980
我要看着你们工作
I want to watch you work.

885
01:09:27,780 --> 01:09:30,620
你要不要特许经营权？
You don't want a franchise, do you?

886
01:09:31,140 --> 01:09:34,140
偷取我泡制火辣辣酱料
Steal the recipe for my secret...

887
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,460
的秘方？
...hot sauce?

888
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:38,540
不要
No.

889
01:09:40,660 --> 01:09:41,820
那很好
That's good.

890
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,060
我谢谢你
I appreclate that.

891
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:50,900
第二条件
Second stipulation.

892
01:09:51,060 --> 01:09:52,820
另外那演员
The other performer...

893
01:09:53,500 --> 01:09:55,340
必须是….
...has to be...

894
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,500
你用的那野兽….
...that animal you use.

895
01:09:57,660 --> 01:09:59,260
戴面具的男人
The man in the mask.

896
01:10:00,660 --> 01:10:02,060
机器
Machine.

897
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:10,660
我不知道
I don't know.

898
01:10:11,580 --> 01:10:13,420
他可能有兴趣
He might be interested.

899
01:10:14,580 --> 01:10:17,860
我想我要多收你….
But I think it'll cost you another...

900
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:22,340
五到七千元
...five to seven grand.

901
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,620
如果你多付一万
我可以安排更特别的东西
I can arrange something
really special for ten.

902
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,420
我可以去安排
We can do that.

903
01:10:27,700 --> 01:10:29,100
那很好
Good enough for me.

904
01:10:30,780 --> 01:10:34,780
我要开始构思
I'll just have to put
my thinking cap on.

905
01:10:38,700 --> 01:10:42,020
我会收起这个当订金
I'm going to keep this as a deposit.

906
01:10:42,180 --> 01:10:45,300
记得今晚十点后打电话给我
You make sure you call me
after 1 0 o'clock tonight.

907
01:10:45,460 --> 01:10:47,100
十点
1 0 o'clock.

908
01:10:51,220 --> 01:10:53,300
你知道吗，你有张很特别
You know, you have a very special...

909
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,540
很漂亮的脸
...very beautiful face.

910
01:10:55,700 --> 01:10:57,980
尤其当光反射在你脸上时
The way light hits it.

911
01:10:58,700 --> 01:11:00,540
我想拍你
I'd like to shoot you.

912
01:11:01,540 --> 01:11:02,620
你不介意吧？
You don't mind?

913
01:11:03,860 --> 01:11:05,340
我怕见镜头
I'm camera-shy.

914
01:11:05,620 --> 01:11:08,500
你信任我让我拿走你的钱
却不让我拍照
You trust me to take your money,
but not your picture?

915
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:11,140
那是两种不同的信任
Those are two different kinds of trust.

916
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,820
希望我们可以合作做生意
I hope we can do business.

917
01:11:22,740 --> 01:11:25,980
何特街，布鲁克林，三点
Hoyt Avenue, Brooklyn, 3 o'clock.

918
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:29,980
我会到
I'll be there.

919
01:11:33,180 --> 01:11:35,580
我还有事，谢谢
I got something to tend to. Thanks.

920
01:11:36,420 --> 01:11:38,700
我们是否要拍电影？
So are we in the movie business?

921
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:40,780
这是给你的
That's for you.

922
01:11:41,020 --> 01:11:41,820
是什么？
What is it?

923
01:11:42,020 --> 01:11:44,020
钱，人们买东西用的
Money.
People use it to purchase goods.

924
01:11:44,500 --> 01:11:46,660
那很慷慨，但….
That's awfully generous
and everything--

925
01:11:46,940 --> 01:11:49,340
不是我的，不要当作什么大事
It's not mine.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

926
01:11:49,500 --> 01:11:53,260
有班飞机和这机票
你今晚可以回洛杉矶
There's a plane ticket and the flight
you can catch to L.A. tonight.

927
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,380
我要你做的就是这么多
This is as far as I want you to go.

928
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,260
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

929
01:11:57,460 --> 01:11:59,100
我们是一伙的
我们是合伙人
We're a team. We're partners.

930
01:11:59,340 --> 01:12:04,100
麦克斯，我肯定你知道
跟我们周旋的这些人
Max, I'm sure you realize
these people we're dealing with...

931
01:12:05,100 --> 01:12:06,700
他们是极度没人性的
...they're extremely disturbed.

932
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,980
所以你需要我
我了解他们，你看我
That's why you need me.
I know disturbed. Look at me.

933
01:12:10,180 --> 01:12:13,140
你做得很好，但是时候回家
You did a great job here.
It's time for you to go home.

934
01:12:13,380 --> 01:12:15,020
但这是我们的大案子
But this is our big case.

935
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:18,460
汤姆，我知道发生什么事？
Tom, I know what's going on, okay?

936
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,220
什么事？
Okay, what?

937
01:12:20,460 --> 01:12:23,300
帝诺和机器和爱迪
制作一套色情暴力电影，对吗？
Dino and Machine and Eddie
made a snuff film, right?

938
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:25,460
我弄不清为什么你会参与其中
I can't figure out why you're involved.

939
01:12:25,700 --> 01:12:27,140
或者这受害人….？
What, maybe the victim--?

940
01:12:27,380 --> 01:12:28,780
第一，谁说你对？
First, who said you're right?

941
01:12:28,980 --> 01:12:31,300
第二，谁说有受害人？
Second, who said
anything about a victim?

942
01:12:31,700 --> 01:12:33,820
汤魏斯，生命只有三条规条
Only 3 rules in life, Tom Welles.

943
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:37,300
一，永远有受害人
二，不要做受害人
One, there's always a victim.
And two, don't be it.

944
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:38,380
三呢？
And three?

945
01:12:38,540 --> 01:12:39,780
忘记三是什么了
I forgot three.

946
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:42,060
好，我希望你忘记一切
Good, I want you to forget everything.

947
01:12:42,300 --> 01:12:45,660
我要你上飞机
回洛杉矶，并忘记一切
I want you to get on a plane,
go back to L.A. and forget it all.

948
01:12:47,060 --> 01:12:48,820
我在西岸工作的机会很多
I get a lot of calls for work
on the West Coast.

949
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:51,580
我会再打电话给你
请你帮忙
I'd like to call you again.
I could use help.

950
01:12:51,740 --> 01:12:54,060
你会再跟我联络吧？
You're going to look me up and call me?

951
01:12:54,220 --> 01:12:58,140
我要你帮我，我认为你很机伶
I could use your help. I meant it
when I said I think you're smart.

952
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:00,580
我不是对你施恩
I'm not patronizing you.

953
01:13:00,740 --> 01:13:02,100
那，谢谢你
Well, thanks.

954
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:05,300
好，你保重，麦克斯
All right.
Well, you take care, Max California.

955
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:14,500
好的，汤魏斯
魔鬼在等着你
All right, Tom Welles.
Devil's waiting on you.

956
01:14:37,260 --> 01:14:39,020
你来了
There you are.

957
01:14:39,340 --> 01:14:41,340
来加入我们
Come and join us.

958
01:14:53,020 --> 01:14:54,740
嗨，机器
Hello, Machine.

959
01:14:55,860 --> 01:14:56,700
喜欢你的工作
Love your work.

960
01:15:02,060 --> 01:15:04,860
有带钱来吗？
Did you bring the money?

961
01:15:06,100 --> 01:15:07,540
在这里
It's right here.

962
01:15:07,780 --> 01:15:08,780
好
Good.

963
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:11,700
女人在哪里？
Where are the women?

964
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,380
女人….
Women...

965
01:15:14,460 --> 01:15:16,460
她们常常迟到
...they're always late.

966
01:15:23,220 --> 01:15:24,500
这是做什么？
What are these for?

967
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:27,460
只是道具
They're just props.

968
01:15:27,620 --> 01:15:29,660
很漂亮，对不对？
Nice, aren't they?

969
01:15:29,980 --> 01:15:33,980
机器和我刚刚在讨论刀的美
Machine and I were just talking
about the beauty of knives.

970
01:15:37,380 --> 01:15:40,380
我的客人来了
My guests have arrived!

971
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:44,460
W先生，可不可以请你
Mister W., would you be so kind...

972
01:15:44,660 --> 01:15:47,660
放下身上的枪械？
...as to remove
any firearms from your person?

973
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:49,380
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

974
01:15:50,580 --> 01:15:53,420
我很讨厌重覆自己
这让我看起来很笨
I hate to repeat myself.
It makes me look so stupid.

975
01:15:53,980 --> 01:15:55,220
慢慢来
Slowly.

976
01:15:55,420 --> 01:15:57,740
请给我看你的枪
Please, show me your gun.

977
01:15:58,900 --> 01:16:00,340
别紧张！
Nice and easy!

978
01:16:01,660 --> 01:16:03,900
对，别紧张
That's right. Easy.

979
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:05,740
好
Good.

980
01:16:06,060 --> 01:16:09,100
把子弹拿出来放在台上
Now empty those bullets onto the table.

981
01:16:09,300 --> 01:16:10,740
很小心地
Very carefully.

982
01:16:10,900 --> 01:16:13,980
-我不知道为何你会以为….
-住口，他妈的
-I don't know why you think--
-Shut up, you fuck!

983
01:16:14,500 --> 01:16:18,700
我会一箭
穿过你他妈的喉咙，明白吗？
I'll put an arrow right through
your goddamn throat, you understand?

984
01:16:24,860 --> 01:16:26,100
就是他
That's him.

985
01:16:27,180 --> 01:16:28,660
最后的子弹
最后一颗
Last bullet. That's last one.

986
01:16:29,340 --> 01:16:30,500
乖孩子
Good boy.

987
01:16:30,700 --> 01:16:33,300
爱迪，把他铐在床上
Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.

988
01:16:33,820 --> 01:16:35,180
是的
Yes, sir.

989
01:16:35,420 --> 01:16:36,700
机器
Machine!

990
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:46,540
刚开始，我不知道对你如何评价
I didn't know
what to make of you at first.

991
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:52,780
而你肯定令到爱迪如坐针毯
And you certainly had Eddie here
on pins and needles.

992
01:16:54,380 --> 01:16:57,380
看哪，在意料之外….
Lo and behold,
from right out of the blue came...

993
01:16:57,620 --> 01:17:01,980
有我们以前生意的伙伴
来解释一切
..an old business acquaintance of ours
to explain everything.

994
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:05,660
机器之神来解疑难
Satan ex machina.

995
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:09,220
你记得龙雕先生吗？
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

996
01:17:12,140 --> 01:17:13,220
让我们解决他
Let's get this over with.

997
01:17:13,460 --> 01:17:15,580
住口，没人跟你说话
Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

998
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:20,820
这些脸孔
在影片里可以做什么
What I could do
with faces like these on film.

999
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:25,300
但我回头想
我为何需要他们的脸孔？
But on second thought,
why would I need their faces?

1000
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:27,740
你要听我说
You're going to listen to me.

1001
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:29,500
你去取那影片
You're going to get that film.

1002
01:17:29,740 --> 01:17:32,700
你去将那影片拿回来交给我
You're going to
bring it back here, give it to me.

1003
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:37,260
效率越高的话
Just so we make this
as efficient as possible...

1004
01:17:37,420 --> 01:17:40,100
我会重重有赏
...there is an incentive.

1005
01:17:51,100 --> 01:17:53,260
这与他无关
He's got nothing to do with this.

1006
01:17:53,420 --> 01:17:55,180
他什么都不知道
He doesn't know anything.

1007
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:59,260
你想到我接着想说什么？！
Can't you guess
what I'm about to say next?!

1008
01:18:00,940 --> 01:18:03,340
如果你不将那影片拿回来给我
If you don't bring me that film...

1009
01:18:03,500 --> 01:18:05,860
我们会杀死他，操他
...we're going to kill him, fuck him...

1010
01:18:06,260 --> 01:18:07,780
并拍摄全程
...and film it.

1011
01:18:11,100 --> 01:18:13,420
如果这还不够
If that's not enough for you...

1012
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:16,500
我们打算去找你的家人
...we're going to go after your family.

1013
01:18:19,300 --> 01:18:20,860
我去取影片
I'll get the film.

1014
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,460
乖孩子
Good boy.

1015
01:18:24,620 --> 01:18:26,220
你非常合作
You're being very cooperative.

1016
01:18:26,780 --> 01:18:29,620
龙雕先生会陪着你
Mr. Longdale here
will keep you company.

1017
01:18:30,700 --> 01:18:31,700
为什么是我？
Why me?

1018
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:34,380
因为我不喜欢你，龙雕先生
Because I don't like you, Mr. Longdale.

1019
01:18:44,140 --> 01:18:45,700
W先生
Mr. W...

1020
01:18:49,140 --> 01:18:50,580
快回来
...hurry back.

1021
01:18:55,100 --> 01:18:57,500
从我一见你，你并没有做过什么
Since I met you,
there isn't much you've done...

1022
01:18:57,740 --> 01:18:59,340
我也没有理会
...that I haven't been party to.

1023
01:18:59,580 --> 01:19:02,580
如果你放弃并退出
就没有事会发生
None of this would be happening
if you'd given up and walked away.

1024
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:05,420
更理想的是
一开始你就没有接这工作
Or better yet,
not taken the job in the first place.

1025
01:19:05,660 --> 01:19:08,060
我没有想到你会查的这么深入
I never expected you to get this far.

1026
01:19:08,260 --> 01:19:10,260
我聘请你因为你年青
I hired you because you're young...

1027
01:19:10,500 --> 01:19:12,340
肯定不会成功
..and completely out of your league.

1028
01:19:12,580 --> 01:19:15,100
但我低估了你的野心
But I underestimated your ambition.

1029
01:19:15,340 --> 01:19:18,060
你看过柯家的豪宅
You took one look
at the Christian compound.

1030
01:19:19,020 --> 01:19:20,020
很让你羡慕吧？
It was heady, wasn't it?

1031
01:19:20,180 --> 01:19:22,100
这次你不只是在门口张望
You weren't just peeking through
the gates this time.

1032
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:24,300
不，柯太太邀请你进入
No, Mrs. Christian welcomed you in.

1033
01:19:24,500 --> 01:19:27,980
你会以为柯太太聘请我们
Do you think people like
the Christians hire people like us...

1034
01:19:28,180 --> 01:19:30,420
便会邀请我们去晚宴？
...as an invitation
to their dinner parties?

1035
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:32,340
我们要为他们收拾烂摊子
No, we're there to clean up the mess...

1036
01:19:32,500 --> 01:19:35,020
替他们收拾残局
...to wipe their royal asses.

1037
01:19:35,260 --> 01:19:36,940
叫你去买套色情暴力电影
You were asked to buy a snuff film.

1038
01:19:37,180 --> 01:19:40,340
他们找不到
你就付钱去制作一套？
They couldn't find one,
so you paid them to make you one?

1039
01:19:40,500 --> 01:19:42,260
情况是不是这样？
Isn't that what happened?

1040
01:19:42,780 --> 01:19:45,460
她本来是活生生的
你付钱让他们把她杀掉？
She was alive
till you paid to have her murdered?

1041
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:47,540
柯先生付了多少钱
给你的良知？
How much did Christian
pay for your conscience?

1042
01:19:47,740 --> 01:19:48,540
一百万？
A million?

1043
01:19:49,340 --> 01:19:50,940
我已经得到补偿
I've been well compensated.

1044
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,020
但你，我廉价请你
But you, I bought cheap.

1045
01:19:54,620 --> 01:19:58,180
因为柯太太赞赏你的谨慎
Just because Mrs. Christian
praised your discretion...

1046
01:19:58,380 --> 01:19:59,860
便把这谋杀案的证物给你
...you sat on evidence of murder.

1047
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:01,620
你将你的朋友，家人
Dragged your friend, family...

1048
01:20:01,820 --> 01:20:04,420
拖进坟墓里
...into some old graveyard...

1049
01:20:04,620 --> 01:20:08,580
将一个没人理会或记得的
死掉少女发掘出来
...to dig up a dead girl with no name
that nobody cares about or remembers.

1050
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:10,140
玛丽 安麦修
Mary Anne Mathews.

1051
01:20:10,300 --> 01:20:11,740
那是她的名字
That was her name.

1052
01:20:11,980 --> 01:20:13,340
她母亲记得她
Her mother remembers her.

1053
01:20:13,540 --> 01:20:14,980
我觉得厌烦
I'm bored with this.

1054
01:20:15,340 --> 01:20:17,500
你知道我们之间的不同处？
You know the only difference
between us?

1055
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:20,980
我会因这事继续生存
并从中获利，而你….
I will survive this and profit by it,
whereas you...

1056
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:22,300
你却不会
...you will not.

1057
01:20:22,580 --> 01:20:24,180
现在去取影片
Now get the film.

1058
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:31,500
你有和他一起看？
Did you watch it with him?

1059
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:32,580
什么？
What?

1060
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:34,980
那影片，你有和他一起看吗？
The snuff film.
Did you watch it with him?

1061
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,500
这帮不到你的朋友，去取影片
This isn't helping your friend.
Get the film.

1062
01:20:37,740 --> 01:20:38,740
他有感到兴奋？
Did it get him off?

1063
01:20:39,260 --> 01:20:40,660
柯先生？
Mr. Christian?

1064
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:44,180
看着他们把她切开
他有手淫吗？
Watching them cut her up like that?
Did he jerk off to it?

1065
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:46,620
你有握他的阴茎替他手淫？
Did you hold his cock?
Give him the hand job...

1066
01:20:46,820 --> 01:20:49,740
当看着玛丽 安麦修死亡？
..while Mary Anne Mathews was dying?

1067
01:20:49,940 --> 01:20:52,660
-你想做什么？
-我尝试去明白
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to understand!

1068
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,100
他要一套色情暴力电影做什么？！
What did he want with a snuff film?!

1069
01:20:55,500 --> 01:20:56,420
你在问为什么？
You're asking why?

1070
01:20:56,660 --> 01:20:58,620
对，为什么？为什么？！
Yes, why? Why?!

1071
01:20:58,860 --> 01:21:00,780
他为什么要一套….
Why did he want a film...

1072
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:03,500
少女被剖开的影片？！
...of a little girl being butchered?!

1073
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:06,260
因为他有能力
Because he could.

1074
01:21:06,860 --> 01:21:08,780
他这样做因为他有能力
He did it because he could.

1075
01:21:10,780 --> 01:21:12,220
你在找什么其他原因？
What other reason
were you looking for?

1076
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:18,420
快
Now.

1077
01:21:32,620 --> 01:21:33,860
这里
Here.

1078
01:21:34,620 --> 01:21:36,140
射我
Shoot me.

1079
01:21:45,060 --> 01:21:47,460
魏斯先生，影片，请
Mr. Welles, the film, please.

1080
01:21:48,540 --> 01:21:49,900
先让他走
Let him go first.

1081
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:52,580
随你喜欢怎样处置我
总之让他走
Do whatever you want to me,
but let him go.

1082
01:21:52,820 --> 01:21:55,060
好的，放开他，机器
Very well. Set him free, Machine.

1083
01:22:31,780 --> 01:22:33,780
-是这个吗？
-是这个
-Is that it?
-That's it.

1084
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,200
太好了
Bravo.

1085
01:22:36,720 --> 01:22:38,600
我不觉得你会想错过这一段
I don't think you want to miss this...

1086
01:22:38,800 --> 01:22:40,440
魏斯先生
...Mr. Welles.

1087
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:51,760
事件完结
So it ends.

1088
01:22:53,680 --> 01:22:56,280
就像她从来没有存在过
As if she never existed.

1089
01:22:56,760 --> 01:23:00,360
不要埋怨自己
你不能控制大局
Don't blame yourself.
You were in way over your head.

1090
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,840
你这卑鄙小人
You motherfuckers.

1091
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,560
你这下流的混帐东西
You smalltime motherfuckers.

1092
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:11,160
我想知道
I want to know something:

1093
01:23:11,680 --> 01:23:15,640
你们有一百万去分，为什么
还是下流的贱货？！
Why you're still smalltime with a
million dollars to spread around?!

1094
01:23:16,120 --> 01:23:17,120
一百万？
Million?

1095
01:23:17,280 --> 01:23:20,200
对，那是柯家给龙雕的！
Yeah! That's what Christian
gave Longdale!

1096
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:22,800
那是他给你的，对不对？
That's what he gave you, right?

1097
01:23:22,960 --> 01:23:24,280
一百万现金？
A million in cash?

1098
01:23:24,680 --> 01:23:26,960
你这白痴他妈的垃圾！
You stupid fucking trash!

1099
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:31,120
去死的，他是不是说美金？
What the hell--
Is he talking dollars here?

1100
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:32,960
不，他在说谎
No, he's lying.

1101
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:34,480
你骗我吗？
Did you fuck me?

1102
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,160
你有没有骗我？
Did you fuck me on this?

1103
01:23:37,320 --> 01:23:38,480
当然没有，爱迪！
Of course not, Edward!

1104
01:23:38,640 --> 01:23:40,720
那他在说什么？
Then what's he talking about?

1105
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:42,160
他在说….
He's saying that...

1106
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:43,920
龙雕骗我们
...Longdale fucked us...

1107
01:23:44,080 --> 01:23:47,080
这是绝对离谱的事
...which is so totally,
completely bizarre.

1108
01:23:47,720 --> 01:23:48,680
退后
Stay back.

1109
01:23:49,280 --> 01:23:50,400
离我远点
Stay away from me.

1110
01:23:51,160 --> 01:23:52,560
放下那把弓！
Put the bow down!

1111
01:23:52,840 --> 01:23:54,640
我告诉过你不要相信那龟蛋
I told you not to trust the prick.

1112
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,600
龙雕先生，如果变态佬
和色情行业之间
Mr. Longdale, if there's no honour...

1113
01:23:57,840 --> 01:23:59,680
没有道义存在的话
...among perverts and pornographers...

1114
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:02,000
整个行业将会崩溃
..the whole business would fall apart.

1115
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:05,880
因为我们没有记录，没有合约
没有法律保障
Because there's no records,
no contracts, no legal recourse.

1116
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,760
所以，如果有人
So if someone...

1117
01:24:08,000 --> 01:24:09,160
欺骗我们
...cheats us...

1118
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:11,080
那人不再被信任
...that person can't be trusted.

1119
01:24:11,240 --> 01:24:13,920
那人会把我们害死
That person could turn us in,
have us killed.

1120
01:24:15,160 --> 01:24:18,960
所以我们无选择余地
对吗，龙雕先生
So we don't have a choice,
do we, Mr. Longdale?

1121
01:24:19,200 --> 01:24:22,200
我要这事完结
没有其他人要被伤害
I want this to be over.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

1122
01:24:22,440 --> 01:24:24,040
爱迪，把你的枪拿出来
Eddie, take your gun out.

1123
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:25,440
操你
Fuck you.

1124
01:24:25,680 --> 01:24:27,840
拿出来，放地上
Take it out now! And drop it.

1125
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:29,680
不然我会开枪
Or I will shoot.

1126
01:24:30,040 --> 01:24:32,000
别那么傻，爱迪
Don't be stupid, Edward.

1127
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,960
用力踢过来
Kick it in my direction. Hard.

1128
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,200
帝诺，快放下那把弓
Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.

1129
01:24:49,720 --> 01:24:51,200
开始
Action.

1130
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:04,640
错了
This is wrong.

1131
01:25:04,840 --> 01:25:06,640
搞错了
Something's wrong.

1132
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:08,880
天啊，不应是这样
God, not like this.

1133
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:13,120
我应该有
I am supposed to have...

1134
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,760
更多的电影感
...something more cinematic.

1135
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:18,080
机器，杀死他们
Kill them, Machine.

1136
01:25:19,400 --> 01:25:21,040
把他们全杀掉
Kill them all.

1137
01:25:28,600 --> 01:25:29,800
机器！
Machine!

1138
01:26:11,120 --> 01:26:11,960
不要动，爱迪
Stop, Eddie!

1139
01:26:13,560 --> 01:26:14,640
我发誓
I swear to Christ!

1140
01:26:14,800 --> 01:26:16,280
我会向你背后开枪
I'll shoot you in the back!

1141
01:26:18,120 --> 01:26:19,320
除掉面具
Take off the mask.

1142
01:26:21,400 --> 01:26:23,040
除掉那他妈的面具！
Take off the fucking mask!

1143
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,280
他只有一颗子弹
He's only got one bullet!

1144
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:09,080
艾美，小心听着
Amy, listen carefully.

1145
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:11,560
-汤姆，你在哪里？
-艾美，听着
-Tom, where are you?
-Amy, just listen.

1146
01:28:11,800 --> 01:28:14,080
现在带仙蒂离开家
Take Cindy. Get out of the house now.

1147
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:16,680
去我们渡国庆日周末的地方
Go to where we spent
Fourth of July weekend.

1148
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,760
-为什么？出了什么岔？
-艾美，我不能解释
-Why? What's wrong?
-Amy, please. l can't.

1149
01:28:19,920 --> 01:28:22,000
我三小时后会到
I'll be there in three hours.

1150
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,240
我在途中，快动身
I'm on my way! Go now!

1151
01:28:24,640 --> 01:28:26,560
汤姆，你吓死我
Tom, you're scaring me.

1152
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,600
艾美，请你照我所说的去做
Please, Amy, just do it!

1153
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,600
好，再见，我现在去
Okay, bye. I'm going.

1154
01:28:39,440 --> 01:28:41,240
柯太太，这是汤魏斯
Mrs. Christian, it's Tom Welles.

1155
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:42,760
龙雕已死
Longdale is dead.

1156
01:28:43,000 --> 01:28:45,080
他被制作那套影片的人所杀
He was killed by the men
who made the film.

1157
01:28:45,320 --> 01:28:48,480
他为你丈夫雇用他们
但藏了一百万的大部份
He hired them for your husband.
Kept most of the million.

1158
01:28:48,680 --> 01:28:50,440
那影片是真的
The film is real!

1159
01:28:50,680 --> 01:28:51,920
他们杀死那少女
They killed that girl!

1160
01:28:53,920 --> 01:28:55,360
柯太太？
Mrs. Christian?

1161
01:28:55,520 --> 01:28:58,360
我仍在，魏斯先生
I'm still here, Mr. Welles.

1162
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,000
对不起，我知道这一定….
I'm sorry. I know this must be--

1163
01:29:00,200 --> 01:29:01,760
你有危险吗？
Are you in danger？.

1164
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,680
我们要报警
我今晚将整件事告诉你
We'll go to the police.
I'll tell you everything tonight.

1165
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,680
我们可以明早报警
We can call the police in the morning.

1166
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:07,960
好的
All right.

1167
01:29:08,440 --> 01:29:09,520
八点整？
Eight o'clock?

1168
01:29:09,800 --> 01:29:11,600
八点整没有问题
Yes, eight o'clock is fine.

1169
01:29:11,800 --> 01:29:12,960
你知不知道….
Do you know...

1170
01:29:13,200 --> 01:29:17,200
那个可怜少女的名字
..what the poor girl's name was?

1171
01:29:19,560 --> 01:29:21,480
玛丽 安麦修
Mary Anne Mathews.

1172
01:29:25,200 --> 01:29:26,200
谢谢你
Thank you.

1173
01:29:26,640 --> 01:29:28,640
再见，魏斯先生
Mr. Welles, goodbye.

1174
01:30:26,480 --> 01:30:28,280
你没事吗？
Are you okay?

1175
01:30:30,200 --> 01:30:31,440
你没事吗？
Are you?

1176
01:30:32,360 --> 01:30:34,760
你为什么没有打电话给我？
Why haven't you called me?

1177
01:30:37,440 --> 01:30:40,680
你为什么在地球的表层失了踪
Why did you disappear
off the face of the Earth?

1178
01:30:41,880 --> 01:30:43,520
你在流血
You're bleeding.

1179
01:30:44,040 --> 01:30:45,720
这是手铐吗？
Are those handcuffs?

1180
01:30:45,880 --> 01:30:47,720
你被人锁起吗？
Were you locked up?

1181
01:30:48,720 --> 01:30:51,440
不准你打电话？发生什么事？
Kept from a phone? What happened?

1182
01:30:51,720 --> 01:30:52,720
汤姆，说话呀
Start talking, Tom.

1183
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:56,880
如果你不想离婚的话
你不能这样对我
Because if you want to stay married,
you can't treat me this way!

1184
01:30:57,720 --> 01:30:58,880
说得对
You're right.

1185
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:01,040
你说的全部对
Everything you say is right.

1186
01:31:03,480 --> 01:31:05,960
汤姆，这样不够
这样不能解决问题
That won't do it.
That's not enough, Tom.

1187
01:31:06,120 --> 01:31:07,320
不会
Not anymore.

1188
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:11,080
我不会让任何事发生在我们身上
I'm not going to let
anything happen to us.

1189
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:13,400
那你看我们现在
Look where we are!

1190
01:31:13,960 --> 01:31:16,720
看看你自己，你看看你自己
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself! Look!

1191
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:19,080
你这狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

1192
01:31:19,320 --> 01:31:23,080
你根本不知道
你是让我怎么过的
You don't even have any idea
what you're putting me through.

1193
01:31:25,000 --> 01:31:28,320
我无法想像你发生什么事
What was I supposed to think
happened to you?

1194
01:31:34,080 --> 01:31:36,080
我们要在这里住几天
We're going to stay here a few days.

1195
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:37,760
只是几天
It's just a few days.

1196
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:39,240
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1197
01:31:39,400 --> 01:31:40,760
没有其他方法
There's no other way around this.

1198
01:31:40,920 --> 01:31:43,240
好了，我发誓，我发誓
Okay, look. I swear, I swear...

1199
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:48,600
我不会让任何事发生在我们身上
我会处理
...I won't let anything happen to us.
I'll take care of it.

1200
01:31:48,760 --> 01:31:50,440
我发誓
I swear it.

1201
01:31:51,440 --> 01:31:52,920
我发誓
I swear it.

1202
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,000
我现在要出去
Now I have to go back out.

1203
01:31:57,760 --> 01:31:59,040
去哪里？
Where?

1204
01:32:02,440 --> 01:32:04,520
我要去见柯太太
I have to see Mrs. Christian.

1205
01:32:05,440 --> 01:32:07,440
她是唯一的证人
She's the only witness.

1206
01:32:08,520 --> 01:32:09,800
什么证人？
To what?

1207
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:14,040
我们会没事的
We're going to be okay.

1208
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:18,880
我们会没事的
We're going to be okay.

1209
01:32:33,040 --> 01:32:35,320
我是汤魏斯，我约了柯太太
Tom Welles.
Mrs. Christian's expecting me.

1210
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:37,480
是，她留下了指示
Yes, she left instructions.

1211
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:40,720
我要立刻见她，这是非常紧急
I have to see her now.
It's extremely urgent.

1212
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:45,320
魏斯先生，柯太太在今天
下午结束了自己的生命
Mrs. Christian chose to take
her own life this afternoon, Mr. Welles.

1213
01:32:50,560 --> 01:32:51,920
但我刚….
But I just....

1214
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:54,160
不，不，我刚….
No, no, I just....

1215
01:32:55,840 --> 01:32:57,240
我刚刚才跟她通过电话
I just spoke to her.

1216
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:00,680
她留下了指示:第一个信封
Her instructions were
that this first envelope...

1217
01:33:01,480 --> 01:33:03,000
是给玛丽 安的家人
...is for Mary's family.

1218
01:33:03,240 --> 01:33:05,840
她写着，你会明白什么意思
She wrote that you'd understand
what that meant.

1219
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,000
第二个信封是给你的
And the second envelope is for you.

1220
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:15,080
丧礼会在下星期举行
假如你想出席的话
Services will be held next week,
if you'd like to attend.

1221
01:33:16,680 --> 01:33:18,360
对不起，先生
I am sorry, sir.

1222
01:33:19,160 --> 01:33:20,280
晚安，先生
Good night, sir.

1223
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,200
请忘记我们

1224
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:57,400
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

1225
01:34:00,200 --> 01:34:01,880
我要回去
I have to go back.

1226
01:34:13,240 --> 01:34:14,960
不管什么事
Whatever it is...

1227
01:34:15,320 --> 01:34:17,240
不管你曾经去过哪里
...wherever you were...

1228
01:34:17,400 --> 01:34:19,560
把一切忘记
...just forget about it.

1229
01:34:19,800 --> 01:34:21,480
你留在此
You stay here.

1230
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:23,560
我不能
I can't.

1231
01:34:26,560 --> 01:34:29,760
冒着我们的生命危险
冒着家人的危险？为什么？
And risk us? Risk your family? Why?

1232
01:34:31,160 --> 01:34:33,680
除了我，没有人收拾残局
There's no one left
to finish this but me.

1233
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,920
我会跟你说
什么时候可以安全回家
I'll call you when it's safe to go home.

1234
01:34:39,680 --> 01:34:42,240
当你回家时，我们未必会在
We may not be there
when you get back.

1235
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,760
仙蒂的教育，还有其他的费用
Cindy's education, and a lot more.

1236
01:35:09,680 --> 01:35:11,120
我爱你
I love you.

1237
01:36:03,080 --> 01:36:05,320
跪下将手放在头上
Put your hands on your head.
Down on your knees.

1238
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:09,400
你以为我是闹着玩？
You think I'm fucking around?

1239
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:13,680
痛了吧？
Hurts, doesn't it?

1240
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:15,240
你想他妈的怎样？
What the fuck do you want?

1241
01:36:15,520 --> 01:36:16,600
机器是谁？
Who's Machine?

1242
01:36:16,760 --> 01:36:18,000
他住在哪里？
Where does he live?

1243
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:19,920
我不知道
I don't know.

1244
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:21,600
我要他的名字
I want his name.

1245
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:23,160
我不知道他的名字
I don't know his name.

1246
01:36:27,280 --> 01:36:29,440
伤害你，我永远不会觉得累
I will never get tired of hurting you.

1247
01:36:29,680 --> 01:36:33,680
我不知道他的名字
他总是带着面具来，带着面具走
I don't know his name. He shows up
in his mask, he leaves in his mask.

1248
01:36:33,960 --> 01:36:35,840
他住在纽约某区
He's from New York somewhere.

1249
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,600
上车
Get in the car.

1250
01:36:44,680 --> 01:36:45,520
为什么？
Why?

1251
01:36:46,120 --> 01:36:48,360
我要你带我去你杀她的现场
You're going to show me
where you killed her.

1252
01:36:49,360 --> 01:36:50,520
操你
Fuck you.

1253
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,720
好的，他妈的
All right, you fuck.

1254
01:37:08,720 --> 01:37:10,960
你带她来之前，对她做过什么？
What did you do before
you brought her here?

1255
01:37:12,240 --> 01:37:14,720
说她如何漂亮….
Tell her how beautiful she was...

1256
01:37:15,880 --> 01:37:18,080
你将会捧她成巨星
...how you'd make her a big star?

1257
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:25,000
向她献殷勤？
Talk her up?

1258
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,240
你想在我身上得到他妈的什么
What the fuck do you want from me?

1259
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:36,920
我想知道
I want to know.

1260
01:37:40,400 --> 01:37:41,840
你想知道？
You want to know?

1261
01:37:45,840 --> 01:37:47,240
她不值一提
She was nothing.

1262
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:49,080
流连在街上的小妓女
A little piece of pussy off the street.

1263
01:37:49,240 --> 01:37:51,760
像这样的少女失了踪
没人会理会
Girl like that disappears,
nobody gives a shit.

1264
01:37:53,360 --> 01:37:55,680
对，我向她献殷勤
Yeah, I talked her up.

1265
01:37:55,920 --> 01:37:59,280
对她说她想听的话
对她说她会成为巨星
Told her everything she wanted to hear.
I told her she'd be a big star...

1266
01:37:59,440 --> 01:38:02,760
她会赚很多钱，还有很多废话
...she'd make a lot of money,
and all the rest of the bullshit.

1267
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:06,960
当我说完，她已为那大荧幕试镜
感到异常兴奋
By the time I was finished, she was
all excited about her big screen test.

1268
01:38:08,960 --> 01:38:10,680
我打电话给帝诺
I called up Dino...

1269
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:13,880
他和机器飞过来
我们开了一个小型派对
...he and Machine flew out here.
We had a little party.

1270
01:38:15,800 --> 01:38:17,280
你还想知道什么？
What else you want to know?

1271
01:38:18,440 --> 01:38:20,040
你看过那影片？
You saw the film, right?

1272
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,360
你知道结局
You know the ending.

1273
01:38:24,560 --> 01:38:26,800
没有人看见你带她来这里？
Nobody else saw you bring her in?

1274
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:32,200
谁会看见？这样的烂地方
Who's going to see?
Place is a fucking shithole.

1275
01:38:35,800 --> 01:38:37,640
我带她进来，然后….
I brought her in and she...

1276
01:38:39,480 --> 01:38:41,960
她看见机器站在角落处
...saw Machine
standing in the corner.

1277
01:38:43,480 --> 01:38:45,080
她开始哭
She started crying...

1278
01:38:47,080 --> 01:38:49,160
发出些声音
...making these little noises.

1279
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:54,000
我打了她要她安静
So I slapped her around a bit
just to shut her up.

1280
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:55,800
帝诺….
Dino...

1281
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:58,000
喂她吃了一些“药丸”
...fed her a bunch of pills.

1282
01:38:59,640 --> 01:39:02,160
机器在这里铺了几块胶布
Machine put down the plastic over here.

1283
01:39:05,480 --> 01:39:07,320
开始把她割开
Just started cutting her up.

1284
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,160
就这样，她死了
That's it. She's dead.

1285
01:39:13,920 --> 01:39:17,000
她死了那么久
除了你，没有人会理会
She's been dead a long time.
Nobody gives a shit but you.

1286
01:39:31,680 --> 01:39:33,440
你想知道
You wanted to know.

1287
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,440
现在你知道了
Now you know.

1288
01:39:37,440 --> 01:39:39,040
你当时在这里
You were in here.

1289
01:39:39,200 --> 01:39:42,760
你从这里看着玛丽 安流血至死
You watched Mary Anne
bleed to death from here.

1290
01:39:44,360 --> 01:39:45,360
为什么？
Why?

1291
01:39:47,200 --> 01:39:48,880
你为什么看？
Why did you watch?

1292
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,280
我喜欢
I felt like it.

1293
01:39:53,360 --> 01:39:55,200
我从来没有看过人被杀
I never saw nobody get done before.

1294
01:39:56,280 --> 01:39:57,280
为什么？
Why?

1295
01:39:58,560 --> 01:40:00,880
你有兴奋，你有射精吗？
Did you get hard? Did you come?

1296
01:40:01,040 --> 01:40:03,560
没有，我感到作呕
No. It made me sick.

1297
01:40:03,800 --> 01:40:05,480
但这与我何干
But what do I give a shit...

1298
01:40:05,720 --> 01:40:09,880
假如一些富有疯子要对着这自渎
...if some rich fucking wacko wants
to beat off to something like that?

1299
01:40:10,040 --> 01:40:11,400
别起来！
Stay down!

1300
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:15,720
我是为钱而做
It was something I did for money.

1301
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:20,400
我需要那些他妈的钱
I needed the fucking money.

1302
01:40:21,240 --> 01:40:22,640
她在哪里？
Where is she?

1303
01:40:22,800 --> 01:40:24,400
你把她埋在哪里？
Where did you put her body?

1304
01:40:24,720 --> 01:40:26,560
我把它埋在丛林里
I buried it in the woods.

1305
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:28,920
你不会找到
You're not going to find it.

1306
01:40:29,160 --> 01:40:31,320
就算你找到又如何？
你会得到什么？
If you find it, so what?
What do you got?

1307
01:40:31,560 --> 01:40:33,840
你只会得到一副骨骸
You got a girl's skeleton, that's it.

1308
01:40:34,000 --> 01:40:36,080
没有了影片，你什么都没有
Without the film, you got nothing.

1309
01:40:37,000 --> 01:40:39,000
你可以做的是放我走
So all you can do is cut me loose.

1310
01:40:39,160 --> 01:40:41,600
因为没有了影片，你什么都没有
Because without the film
you got nothing--

1311
01:40:41,840 --> 01:40:43,400
你他妈的在做什么？
What the fuck are you doing?!

1312
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,600
-将手放在背后
-操你
-Put your hands behind your back.
-Fuck you!

1313
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,840
将手放在背后
Put your hands behind your back!

1314
01:40:49,080 --> 01:40:50,600
好的
All right.

1315
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,840
你他妈的在做什么？
What the fuck are you doing?

1316
01:41:03,760 --> 01:41:05,600
我准备杀了你
I'm going to kill you.

1317
01:41:07,120 --> 01:41:08,960
我准备杀了你
I'm going to kill you.

1318
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:14,040
然后把你丢在这里
就像你对她一样
And I'm going to leave you here
just like you left her.

1319
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:17,800
你不会杀我
You're not going to kill me.

1320
01:41:18,440 --> 01:41:19,800
你没有那种勇气
You don't have it in you.

1321
01:41:21,120 --> 01:41:23,960
你打算怎么做？用你的枪射我？
What are you going to do?
Shoot me with your own gun?

1322
01:41:24,120 --> 01:41:25,560
用你名字登记的枪
Registered in your name?

1323
01:41:27,800 --> 01:41:30,560
你小心地计划这行动，是吗？
You really thought this through,
didn't you, genius?

1324
01:41:30,800 --> 01:41:33,120
你要将子弹从我的头挖出来
You'll have to dig
the bullets out of my head.

1325
01:41:33,400 --> 01:41:35,040
那会很有趣
That'll be nice.

1326
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:38,880
或你可以掘一个洞
Or you could dig a hole.

1327
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:41,040
用你的双手去掘
Dig it with your own hands...

1328
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,240
然后将我埋在你的女朋友旁边
...and bury me next to your girlfriend.

1329
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:45,040
动手吧
Go ahead.

1330
01:41:45,720 --> 01:41:46,800
开他妈的枪吧
Pull the fucking trigger.

1331
01:41:47,320 --> 01:41:48,240
动手吧
Go ahead.

1332
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,640
你还在等什么？动手开枪吧
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, do it.

1333
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,320
你这同性恋
You faggot!

1334
01:41:54,480 --> 01:41:56,480
你要我做什么？哭？
What do you want me to do?
Start crying?

1335
01:41:56,720 --> 01:41:59,160
像婴儿般哭？
“我后悔杀了那少女”
Like a baby?
''I'm so sorry I killed the girl.''

1336
01:41:59,320 --> 01:42:01,240
操你！操她！
Fuck you! And fuck her!

1337
01:42:01,480 --> 01:42:05,240
动手吧，带我脱离痛苦
开他妈的枪吧
Go ahead, put me out of my misery.
Pull the fucking trigger.

1338
01:42:06,400 --> 01:42:08,000
开他妈的枪吧
Pull the fucking trigger.

1339
01:42:08,480 --> 01:42:09,480
开吧
Do it!

1340
01:42:10,480 --> 01:42:11,400
开吧
Do it!

1341
01:42:18,840 --> 01:42:20,520
你不敢开
You can't do it.

1342
01:42:21,360 --> 01:42:23,520
你这娘娘腔
You little pansy bitch!

1343
01:42:23,680 --> 01:42:24,920
你看你….
Look at you...

1344
01:42:25,080 --> 01:42:27,000
操你的大英雄
...big fucking hero, man.

1345
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:28,840
你不敢开枪
You can't fucking do it.

1346
01:42:30,760 --> 01:42:32,000
看看他
Look at him.

1347
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:34,520
他妈的大英雄
Big fucking hero.

1348
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:37,600
快回到你太太那
Go on home to your wifey!

1349
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:40,520
你这胆小鬼
You pussy!

1350
01:42:41,200 --> 01:42:43,200
你这他妈的胆小鬼
You big fucking pussy!

1351
01:42:45,040 --> 01:42:47,360
你现在可以做什么，娘娘腔？
What are you going to do now, faggot?

1352
01:42:49,880 --> 01:42:52,040
你不能去报警
You can't go to the cops!

1353

杀了她，埋葬了她

是看着他们面上的表情
The look on their face.

1418
01:53:45,480 --> 01:53:46,960
那个表情….
It's that look...

1419
01:53:47,240 --> 01:53:48,800
不是当他们被吓唬
..not when they're threatened...

1420
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,640
不是当你伤害他们
...not when you hurt them...

1421
01:53:50,960 --> 01:53:53,480
更不是当他们看见刀

1422
01:53:54,040 --> 01:53:56,160
而是当他们感觉刀锋插入
It's when they feel the knife go in.

1423
01:53:56,320 --> 01:53:57,560
就是这

他们不能相信这事真的发生
They can't believe
it's really happening.

1426

她有这个表情

1427
01:54:04,000 --> 01:54:05,160
那少女….
The girl...

1428
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:07,000
当她发觉那不光是小电影
...when she knew it wasn't just porno.

1429
01:54:07,240 --> 01:54:08,320

1434
01:54:54,880 --> 01:54:56,360
很难让你明白？
Can't get your mind around it?

1435
01:54:57,360 --> 01:54:59,040
我没有答案
I don't have any answers.

1436
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,360
我所说的不会让你晚上睡得好

1441
01:55:13,880 --> 01:55:15,800
情形就是这样
That's all there is to it!

1442
01:55:28,240 --> 01:55:29,560
没有秘密
There's no mystery.

我所做的
我那样做是因为我喜欢

I like them.

1444
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:36,640
因为我想做
Because I want to.

1445

你被刀伤，多少刀？

先生，请问你叫什么名字？

不会被填平
But nothing will ever
fill the hole in my heart.

...after I  get some help for myself.

1460
01:59:30,200 --> 01:59:32,440
我恨你将事实告诉我
I  hated you
for telling me the truth...

1461
01:59:32,600 --> 01:59:36,200
