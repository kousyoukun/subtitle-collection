1
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,540
Welcome to Miami.

2
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:28,980
While in the airport, please
observe Florida and local laws...

3
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:31,540
...which prohibit smoking
in the terminal.

4
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:33,940
Thank you for not smoking.

5
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,060
Your son-in-law dealt with the
dry cleaning franchise during the day.

6
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,340
He saw that woman every night.

7
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,220
The specifics are in my report,
and information about the woman.

8
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,700
It's unpleasant, I know.

9
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,100
Discreet, isn't he?

10
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,180
What an imbecile!

11
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,420
I tried to warn my daughter...

12
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,660
...but what can you do?

13
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,580
I worry about the children.

14
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,980
My invoice is in the envelope,
if that's all.

15
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,620
Yes, Mr. Welles. Thank you.

16
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,500
Let me know if I can be of
further assistance to you, Senator.

17
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:25,260
I'll be in touch.

18
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,620
Hello?

19
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,540
You're home.

20
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,820
We're back here.

21
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,820
How did it go?

22
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,100
I think very well.

23
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:11,500
Good.

24
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,620
Daddy's home, sweetie.

25
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,780
How's the textbook business?

26
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,980
I got 1 0,000 words on
the federal theatre project.

27
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,460
It should be 4,000 and the writer
doesn't want to change anything.

28
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,940
So kind of bad.

29
00:04:27,340 --> 00:04:28,820
How was Miami?

30
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:30,460
Fine. Lonesome.

31
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:32,580
Couldn't pay me enough
to live down there.

32
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,380
Then why'd you go?

33
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,820
Senator Michaelson has
powerful friends.

34
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,340
Hello, Cinderella.

35
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:48,020
Did you miss me?
I sure missed you.

36
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,740
-She missed you.
-That's my girl.

37
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,220
She missed you.
I missed you.

38
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,900
You been smoking?

39
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,980
Smoking? I'm not smoking.

40
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,860
Come on, honey.

41
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,020
You reek of it.

42
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,460
Amy, I've been sitting around
in bars following this guy.

43
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,500
Is this the first thing I get?

44
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:11,260
-You're accusing me?
-I'm not accusing you.

45
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:15,060
I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been all through that.

46
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:18,140
I'll make dinner.
Are you hungry?

47
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,340
You're cooking?

48
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,900
I missed you.

49
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:33,060
I don't like it when you leave.

50
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,020
Should I go?

51
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:41,020
I'm going to do it.

52
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,500
Come on.

53
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:56,420
What's all the trouble, Cinderella?

54
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,660
There, there.

55
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,580
I love you.

56
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:13,180
I love you.

57
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:28,300
Honey, phone!

58
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,260
Okay, I've got it!

59
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,020
Sorry, I was just switching phones.

60
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,100
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Longdale.

61
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,420
How can I be of assistance to you?

62
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:56,460
Four o'clock would be fine.

63
00:07:00,460 --> 00:07:02,300
I think I know where it is.

64
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,140
Mr. Welles, Daniel Longdale.
We spoke on the phone.

65
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,140
Pleasure.

66
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,340
I'm the Christians' attorney and
one of the executors of the estate.

67
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,620
This is Mrs. Christian.

68
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:51,500
It's an honour to meet you, ma'am.

69
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,140
You come highly recommended,
Mr. Welles.

70
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,100
I've spoken to assoclates of mine in
Harrisburg and Lancaster and Hershey.

71
00:07:58,300 --> 00:07:59,860
You have influential friends.

72
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,940
I've been privileged to provide
services for people I admire.

73
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,500
You were praised
for your discretion...

74
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:08,900
...your strict adherence
to confidentiality.

75
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:09,980
Thank you, ma'am.

76
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,020
As you know,
my husband passed away recently.

77
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,420
My condolences, Mrs. Christian.

78
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:22,020
His passing has left me...

79
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,700
...with a dilemma.

80
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
I'll do whatever I can to help.

81
00:08:26,820 --> 00:08:29,100
My husband's inner sanctum.

82
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,700
Not many people have been
inside this room.

83
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,020
My father worked the Pittsburgh mill.

84
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:38,420
Irving United Steel, I believe.

85
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,980
But you attended Penn
on an academic scholarship.

86
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,260
That's right.

87
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,860
Peers went into law and finance,
but you chose surveillance.

88
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:46,860
I decided it was the future.

89
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,660
Your husband is a legend.

90
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,900
Please.

91
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:52,580
We were married 45 years.

92
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,940
Four children, seven grandchildren.

93
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:58,060
But his true passion lay...

94
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,460
...in his work.

95
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,460
But he was always loyal.

96
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:03,100
I loved him...

97
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,620
...deeply.

98
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,420
I understand.

99
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,980
Daniel.

100
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,220
My husband was the only one with
the combination to this safe.

101
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,020
We had to hire somebody to open it.

102
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,380
I prevented anyone...

103
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,660
...from seeing the contents.

104
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:23,860
I felt these were
my husband's private things.

105
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,100
I didn't....

106
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,780
I didn't realize....

107
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,900
Do you want to tell me
what you found?

108
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,340
Cash, stock certificates.

109
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:40,660
Nothing out of the ordinary,
really, except that.

110
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,540
It's a film...

111
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,700
...where a girl appears to be murdered.

112
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:49,580
I'm not sure I understand.

113
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,380
It's very realistic.

114
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:54,740
But how many people seem to be
realistically killed...

115
00:09:54,940 --> 00:09:56,660
...in movies and on TV every day?

116
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,980
It begins as a relatively
sleazy bit of pornography...

117
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:04,060
...and rapidly turns
quite violent and bloody.

118
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,860
What you're talking about
is called a snuff film.

119
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,260
From what I know,
snuff films are an urban myth.

120
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,700
Sex industry folklore.
There's no such thing.

121
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,700
That's what I explained
to Mrs. Christian.

122
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,300
This is probably
an S & M film of some sort.

123
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:24,420
Simulated rape, simulated violence.

124
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,780
It's hard to stomach,
but there are ways of doing it.

125
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,540
Fake blood, special effects.

126
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,780
Would you look at the film
and give us your opinion?

127
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,580
All I want...

128
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:37,820
...is to know that
this atrocity is false.

129
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:40,060
I want the proof.

130
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:31,500
Well...

131
00:12:31,700 --> 00:12:34,700
...whoever made the film was adept
at authenticity.

132
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,420
But I'm no expert. I suggest letting
the police make a determination.

133
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,500
Out of the question.

134
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:42,340
That would be so unnecessary
for any number of reasons...

135
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,620
...not the least of which is
Mr. Christian's reputation.

136
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,020
We want you to find out
who made this film...

137
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,940
...and establish whether it's real.

138
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,700
You can name your price.

139
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:56,540
You'll be provided with whatever
you need to buy information.

140
00:12:58,780 --> 00:13:00,660
Girl's all I've got to go on.

141
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,580
I could treat it
like a missing persons case.

142
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,700
Understood.

143
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,900
Of course...

144
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:08,660
...we need to be assured
that you would not copy this film.

145
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,620
You have my word on that.

146
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,980
But I'll be dealing
directly with you...

147
00:13:13,180 --> 00:13:14,100
...and only you.

148
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,140
Your relationship with
your attorney is your own.

149
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,220
-No offense.
-None taken.

150
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:21,580
I realize you've given this
careful consideration.

151
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,380
You could have destroyed it.

152
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:27,100
Tell me the poor girl wasn't killed.

153
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:28,580
Please?

154
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,620
Find her alive.

155
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,860
I'll do the best I can, ma'am.

156
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,420
Cleveland?

157
00:14:13,660 --> 00:14:14,580
You just got home.

158
00:14:14,780 --> 00:14:17,460
And I wish I could stay,
but this is the mortgage.

159
00:14:17,660 --> 00:14:19,100
It's Cindy's college money.

160
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:21,460
If I do right by her,
with the circle she runs in...

161
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:23,060
...this could be a big break.

162
00:14:23,260 --> 00:14:24,660
I didn't know we needed a break.

163
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,780
Your father seems to think we do.

164
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:32,380
So, what was Mrs. Christian like?

165
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,900
Like you'd expect, I guess.
I feel sorry for her.

166
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,140
It's a missing persons.

167
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:39,980
I told her I'd give it
a couple, three weeks.

168
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:43,540
It can't take longer than that.
It's an outside shot.

169
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:47,700
That's all I can tell you. Sometimes
you can't know what I'm doing.

170
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,100
It's always that way.

171
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,700
She's awake. I'll get her.

172
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,620
All right, I'll be up in a sec.

173
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,340
-You're taking the gun?
-I won't need it.

174
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,340
Don't take it.

175
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,220
I won't wear it.
It's just a precaution.

176
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,260
Don't worry.

177
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,940
Will you call me
when you get there, please?

178
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:50,060
I've been hired by a couple in
Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.

179
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,420
A few days ago, they picked up
a girl hitchhiking off 81...

180
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,620
...a runaway, about 18, maybe.

181
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,100
They buy her a meal.

182
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,500
The doctor tries to convince her...

183
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:01,820
...that, at the very least,
she should call home.

184
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:04,500
Not surprisingly, the girl ate,
excused herself...

185
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:06,300
...that was the last they saw of her.

186
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,540
We had a friend of mine at
the department work up a sketch.

187
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,860
They want to see
if I can ID this girl...

188
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,180
...then pass along
a message to the parents...

189
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:16,380
...letting them know
the kid's alive.

190
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,260
You don't mind if I run a check?

191
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,780
Go ahead.

192
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,740
You want it, you got it.

193
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,100
Knock yourself out.

194
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,580
Anywhere from 850,000 to 1 ,000,000
missing every year.

195
00:16:27,740 --> 00:16:31,100
We have as much as we can on computer,
then it's the wet-thumb method.

196
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,100
Files are by state and year
of disappearance.

197
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,820
We keep children
and adults separate.

198
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,340
No eating or smoking.

199
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,140
-The coffee machine's in the hall.
-Any good?

200
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,460
Horrible.

201
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,540
It'll be your best friend
after a few days...

202
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,260
...if you last that long.

203
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,660
Good luck.

204
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,660
Honey, it's me.

205
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,700
How are you?

206
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,940
I'm good.

207
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,100
Where are you?

208
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,100
I'm still in Cleveland.
How's Cindy?

209
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:59,020
She's sweet.
She's sleeping.

210
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:00,980
I'm missing you bigtime.

211
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,780
Yeah, l miss you too.

212
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,580
I'll call you tomorrow.

213
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,380
Okay. Good night.

214
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,220
Good night, sweetheart.

215
00:17:51,620 --> 00:17:53,660
Hello, Mrs. Christian?
Tom Welles.

216
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,060
Here's where we stand.

217
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:58,580
l checked the film stock.
It's called Supralux 544.

218
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:02,260
The company that made that
stock discontinued it in '92.

219
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,780
So the film was made prior to that.

220
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,660
I'm probably being overly
thorough with this...

221
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:10,940
...but you might want to dig up your
husband's financial records...

222
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:12,740
...about 6 or 7 years ago.

223
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:15,540
See if there's anything
out of the ordinary.

224
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:19,220
Obviously, this isn't a movie
you drop off at the one-hour photo.

225
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,180
So you think it's one of a kind.

226
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:24,700
The film that went through the camera
is what we've got. There's no negative.

227
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:27,900
Unlike video, it's not really
designed to be duplicated.

228
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,180
Whatever this is,
l have a feeling...

229
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,180
...there aren't many copies
floating around, if any.

230
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,940
I'm looking for a girl we're
not sure is missing.

231
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,700
With this happening 6 or 7 years ago...

232
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,700
...finding the guys
who made this film...

233
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,020
...frankly, is going
to be very difficult.

234
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:47,220
l know you can do it.
You're doing a wonderful job.

235
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,460
Please tell me you'll
continue the investigation.

236
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,660
l will. I'll keep trying for you.

237
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:55,260
You can count on me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.

238
00:18:56,620 --> 00:19:00,740
We can't come to the phone right now,
so please leave a message at the beep.

239
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:01,980
Honey, it's me.

240
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,060
I'm sorry I forgot
to call last night.

241
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,860
I won't forget tonight.

242
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,820
I've been gone a long time
and I hope I'll be home soon.

243
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,820
I love you, and I miss you.
We'll talk tonight.

244
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,500
You looking for Janet?

245
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,780
Hello, Mrs. Mathews?

246
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:44,420
I'm Thomas Hart.
I'm a state-licensed investigator.

247
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:48,020
I've been hired by the U.S.
Resource Centre, Missing Persons...

248
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:49,740
...as part of an internal audit.

249
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,740
I'd like to make an appointment
with you...

250
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,940
...to answer questions
about your daughter, Mary Anne.

251
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,220
I spoke to your FBI contact
yesterday, Agent....

252
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,860
Neil. Neil Cole?

253
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:05,220
Yes, Agent Cole. He told me he'd call
and let you know to expect me.

254
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,180
He didn't call?

255
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,420
Is this you?

256
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,500
You look about five years old.

257
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:19,780
A little older.

258
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,140
Sweet.

259
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,860
It's important that...

260
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:29,260
...you don't let this raise
your expectations.

261
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,620
It's not going to effect
any ongoing efforts.

262
00:21:33,340 --> 00:21:35,300
All I'm saying is, please know that...

263
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,140
...I'm not here to create
any false hope.

264
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,820
We fought all the time,
Mary Anne and me...

265
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,220
...and her stepdad.

266
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,020
She hated him...

267
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
...because he wasn't her real dad.

268
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:53,820
Trouble here, trouble at school.

269
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:55,100
Trouble.

270
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,060
Didn't like rules.
Takes after me, I guess.

271
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,500
I had to learn the hard way.

272
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,700
Can I speak to your husband?

273
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:05,820
Her stepfather?

274
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:07,100
Dave?

275
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,580
Gone.

276
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:11,220
Two years after Mary Anne left.

277
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,580
All the time, she resented him.

278
00:22:14,780 --> 00:22:18,420
I lost her because of him,
and then I lost him.

279
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:21,100
I'm the only one still here.

280
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:24,260
Did Mary have a boyfriend?

281
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,940
She was sneaking out with someone.

282
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,180
She wouldn't tell me who.

283
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,700
Coming home with hickeys,
lying all the time.

284
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,620
I am sorry to bring this up,
but in these circumstances...

285
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:39,460
...with the stepfather....

286
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:42,740
Were there any indications
of any sort of abuse?

287
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,780
There was nothing like that.
The police and FBI asked.

288
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,900
Nothing happened like that.
Never.

289
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,220
She'd have told me.

290
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,860
I apologize. I had to ask.

291
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,260
Those are for her birthday.
One for every year she missed.

292
00:22:57,500 --> 00:23:00,060
They'll be waiting for her
when she comes back.

293
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:03,900
It's because I slapped her.

294
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,740
I know.

295
00:23:08,380 --> 00:23:12,500
We was fighting about Dave,
and she was just pushing my buttons.

296
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,060
And I slapped her.

297
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,060
Jesus.

298
00:23:18,460 --> 00:23:19,780
Next day, she was gone.

299
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:23,620
When kids run, they almost
always leave a note.

300
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:24,980
It's guilt, usually.

301
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,740
There wasn't one.

302
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,220
Police looked.

303
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:30,900
An abduction's one thing,
a runaway's another.

304
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,340
Sometimes it's not the priority
for the police it should be.

305
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,580
There wasn't anything.
Don't you think I wish there was?

306
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,380
You're probably right,
but would you let me look?

307
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:44,660
You tell me...

308
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,900
...not to get my hopes up...

309
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:50,340
...not to raise my expectations.

310
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,500
Go ahead.

311
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,460
I need a drink.

312
00:23:58,660 --> 00:23:59,860
Thank you.

313
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,620
Dear Mom: lf you're reading this...

314
00:25:45,820 --> 00:25:48,780
...it probably means l called you
from Hollywood, California.

315
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:52,980
l left my diary behind because
l want you to see why I'm leaving.

316
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,740
It's not because you hit me.

317
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:57,980
l hid this so Dave the dickhead
wouldn't find it.

318
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,260
Warren Anderson and me
are in love.

319
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,620
I'm going to start
a whole new life with him.

320
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,700
Warren's dad owns
that garage in town.

321
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:07,660
But Warren has even bigger plans.

322
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,740
Warren'll become a star
in action movies.

323
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:12,660
He says I'm prettier
than a lot of girls in movies.

324
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,140
I could be a star too.

325
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,900
You want a drink?

326
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:17,860
When we cruise into Hollywood...

327
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:22,500
...I'll have fiery eyes that everyone
will notice, because l am in love.

328
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:27,340
You were right.
I didn't find anything.

329
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:29,460
Fixed you a drink.

330
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,020
Thanks, no.
I've got work to do.

331
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,020
I'll stop by tomorrow night.

332
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,460
We'll probably be married
by the time you read this.

333
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,740
Don't come looking for me,
because I'm not coming back.

334
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:41,020
Don't come looking for me,
because I'm not coming back.

335
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:44,820
Maybe someday you'll see me
on TVor in magazines.

336
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:48,100
Don't worry about me.
Love, Mary Anne.

337
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,060
Mr. Anderson?

338
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,180
Who's asking?

339
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:56,060
Tom Hart.
Excuse me not shaking hands.

340
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:00,020
I'm looking for your son.
You've got a son named Warren, right?

341
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,380
Sure.

342
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,660
What's it about?

343
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:04,980
You a cop?

344
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:06,100
No, sir.

345
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,740
Just a friend from a while back.
Owe him some money, actually.

346
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,060
You owe him money?

347
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:13,620
That's a new one.

348
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:17,780
You can leave it
right here if you want.

349
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:21,180
If it's all the same,
I'd like to send it to him.

350
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,100
California, right?

351
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,260
California?

352
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,620
Son, you know where
the Fayetteville lockup is?

353
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,020
That's where Warren is.

354
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,620
Doing eight months on a B and E.

355
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,900
Thank you.

356
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:45,180
Yeah, man, I knew her.

357
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,900
Dumped that bitch right
before I moved to L.A.

358
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,220
She shows up knocking at my door
like a fucking stalker.

359
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,780
Told that bitch she could go to hell.

360
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,980
Where'd she go?

361
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,340
Hell, maybe.

362
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,940
I don't know and
I don't give a fuck either.

363
00:28:06,580 --> 00:28:09,220
She said she might work
at a titty bar or something.

364
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:12,180
Ask me, her tits
weren't all that great.

365
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:15,540
Did you hear from her again?

366
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:20,660
Just because I was fucking her
doesn't mean I wanted her out there.

367
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:24,380
She came to Hollywood to be
a big fucking movie star.

368
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,220
And so did I.

369
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,500
Check me out now.

370
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:34,580
Why don't you
pass me one of them smokes?

371
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,380
I don't smoke.

372
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:48,020
How you doing?

373
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,260
I'm okay.

374
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,180
You don't sound okay.

375
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,300
It's not easy.

376
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,740
Why? What's going on?

377
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,620
It's tougher than I thought
it would be, that's all.

378
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:59,060
Is it getting to you?

379
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:00,860
l got a lead l can't drop.

380
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:03,020
I'm almost done.
I miss you.

381
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:04,700
I miss you too.
I love you.

382
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,420
Give Cindy a kiss for me, okay?

383
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:09,780
Wait, I think she wants to say bye.
Say bye to Daddy.

384
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,420
Hi, sweetie.

385
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,540
Hi, honey.

386
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,940
Hi, Cinderella.

387
00:29:14,140 --> 00:29:16,380
She's touching the phone.

388
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,820
You should see her face
at your voice.

389
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,340
I love you.

390
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:23,860
I love you too. Bye.

391
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,220
I was just making dinner.

392
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,340
I've made enough for two,
as it happens.

393
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:33,420
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

394
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,140
I wanted to let you know
I spoke to my people at the agency.

395
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:40,220
I told them to keep
Mary Anne's case active.

396
00:29:41,340 --> 00:29:42,700
Well...

397
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:46,540
...stay for a drink, at least.

398
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,860
You sure you're not hungry?

399
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:54,940
It'd be nice to have a meal
without the TV on for once.

400
00:29:55,740 --> 00:29:57,340
I have a long drive ahead of me.

401
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,380
It's one of the most
depressing things. Eating alone.

402
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,620
I don't know why. You'd think
I'd be used to it by now.

403
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:15,540
Mrs. Mathews?

404
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:17,860
Janet.

405
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:20,620
Do you ever consider....

406
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,860
Do you realize that
Mary may never come back?

407
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,300
I think about it every day.

408
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,460
Every time the phone rings...

409
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:32,860
...every time, I still think it's her.

410
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:35,740
She's all I think about.

411
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,020
Can you tell me...

412
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,540
...if you had to make a choice,
if you were forced to choose...

413
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:47,260
...between imagining her
out there somewhere...

414
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:50,460
...living a good life, being happy...

415
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,460
...but you don't know...

416
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:55,820
...you never find out...

417
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:59,260
...or the worst being true...

418
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,620
...her being gone...

419
00:31:02,860 --> 00:31:04,380
...but you know.

420
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,900
You finally know...

421
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:09,900
...what's happened to her.

422
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:13,140
What would I choose?

423
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,340
Yes.

424
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:21,100
I would choose to know.

425
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,580
I need to know.

426
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,940
Excuse me,
I have to use your restroom.

427
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:28,220
You're leaving.

428
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:35,500
I'll call you if I find anything out.

429
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,940
How you doing?

430
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:15,060
Big date tonight?

431
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,500
Yeah, guess so.

432
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,380
Could I interest you
in a battery-operated vagina?

433
00:35:21,180 --> 00:35:23,060
It's tempting, but no thanks.

434
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:26,580
I'd hate to see you caught in
one of those everyday situations...

435
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:29,940
...that calls for a battery-operated
vagina and you don't have one.

436
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,460
I'll risk it.

437
00:35:32,900 --> 00:35:35,740
All right, your total
is ก็7 4.58 please.

438
00:35:39,140 --> 00:35:40,540
A hundred.

439
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:49,100
Total's ก็25 and some change.

440
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,020
I'd like to thank you
for shopping at Adult Bookstore.

441
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:57,660
And have yourself a fabulous day.

442
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,420
What are you reading?

443
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:03,820
Catchy title.
What are you really reading?

444
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,980
Hard to believe it's got
any parts worth highlighting.

445
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:11,740
Capote.

446
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,900
You know how it is.

447
00:36:15,500 --> 00:36:18,740
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
in front of your fellow perverts.

448
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:22,860
I might get drummed out
of the pornographers' union.

449
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:24,460
Where would I be then?

450
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:29,020
Have a good day.

451
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:56,860
How are you?

452
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,460
Hey, honey.

453
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:00,660
-How you doing?
-I'm a little beat.

454
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,660
How's Cindy?

455
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,700
She's sweet. She misses you.

456
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,380
How's it going?

457
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:09,180
The way things are going,
I'm thinking about coming home.

458
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,460
Really?

459
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:13,380
Honey, wait.

460
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,620
Can I call you back?

461
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:20,900
I'll call you right back, l promise.
Bye, honey.

462
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:03,340
Mrs. Christian, there were 3 men.

463
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:06,060
Not just the cameraman
and the masked man.

464
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,420
l caught a glimpse of a third man.
He was watching.

465
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:13,580
I'll try to get a clearer image
through computer enhancement.

466
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:16,860
But this probably happened
6 years ago, so it's not--

467
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:18,900
All right, I'll keep trying.

468
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,940
Thank you.
l appreclate your support.

469
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:21,940
Goodbye.

470
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:25,940
What we have here is
1 37 billable man-hours...

471
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:28,620
...a hundred-plus thousand
dollars machine...

472
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,300
...and the result is a...

473
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:34,220
...fully rasterised enhancement
of the back of some guy's head.

474
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,540
Want it framed?

475
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:40,220
There you go. Have a nice day.

476
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:45,020
It's like a gas station,
you pay before you pump.

477
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,460
Remember me?

478
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:52,660
Came back for the battery-operated
vagina after all.

479
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:55,820
I need information.
Maybe you could help.

480
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:58,820
Thomas Welles. Nice picture.

481
00:38:59,340 --> 00:39:02,580
What sort of information?
Because I got all different kinds.

482
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:03,860
The kind I'll pay for.

483
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:07,060
I don't know
what you're looking for...

484
00:39:07,260 --> 00:39:09,340
...so we're clear from the start,
I'm straight.

485
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,620
Congratulations.

486
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:11,900
Thank you.

487
00:39:12,180 --> 00:39:13,100
Zip it!

488
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:14,540
I can hook you up.

489
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:16,540
You name the vice,
I name the price.

490
00:39:17,060 --> 00:39:18,380
How long you been working here?

491
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,180
Almost two years.

492
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,500
What's your name,
if you don't mind me asking?

493
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:24,140
Max.

494
00:39:25,460 --> 00:39:26,380
Here's the deal.

495
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,300
This thing I'm on now has to do
with underground pornography.

496
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,180
Stuff that's sold under
the counter, illegally.

497
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,500
There's not much illegal out there.

498
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:38,180
Whatever there is, I want to know.
I want a good look.

499
00:39:38,380 --> 00:39:41,900
So if you've got that kind of
connection, great. If not, speak now.

500
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,780
You're not a cop, are you?

501
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:46,180
If I ask and you are,
you got to tell me.

502
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,820
I'm not a cop.

503
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:49,860
A private detective?

504
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,500
Like Shaft?

505
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,900
You ever seen Private Dicks?
I got it on sale.

506
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,700
How much you make in there?

507
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:02,420
Around 400 bucks a week,
off the books.

508
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:04,820
Let's pretend I live
in the same fantasy world...

509
00:40:05,020 --> 00:40:07,100
...where you make ก็400
a week in that dump.

510
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:09,460
I'll give you 500 for a few days.

511
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:10,900
Six sounds good, Pops.

512
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,220
Five.

513
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,340
Here's my number.

514
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:20,900
When can you start?

515
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:23,940
Well, tomorrow night I get off late.

516
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,860
Tomorrow.

517
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:26,940
All right.

518
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,980
And don't call me Pops.

519
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:33,700
Of course not. I wouldn't
want to hurt your feelings.

520
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:37,860
Look, l don't know
what your scene is.

521
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:39,860
You may like porn
as much as the next guy.

522
00:40:40,060 --> 00:40:42,180
But you don't look
like your average sleaze.

523
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,660
More like your average fucking cop.

524
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:48,220
So when you ask people about fucking
illegal stuff, it has a certain...

525
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,420
...patina to it.

526
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,500
Patina.

527
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,620
It's a Truman Capote word.
Hello?

528
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:54,660
If someone never saw
or sold a snuff film...

529
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:56,500
...they shouldn't care
what I ask.

530
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,580
If they have,
they should be nervous.

531
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,380
Whoever acts insulted,
keep knocking on their door.

532
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:05,380
Look, Pops, it's not too late
to change your mind about all this.

533
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:08,300
There's things you're going
to see that you can't unsee.

534
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,020
They get in your head and stay there.

535
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,740
How do you know what I've seen?

536
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:15,060
Okay, fine.
But everybody's got their limit.

537
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:18,660
I've been here 6 fucking years
trying to get my music together.

538
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:22,260
So I start part-time
where I work to make ends meet.

539
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:25,780
And boom, a couple years go by,
and here I am.

540
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,540
I'm just saying, before you know it,
you're in it. Deep in it.

541
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:31,380
Don't worry about me.

542
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:32,500
But thank you.

543
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,340
You're welcome.

544
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:37,820
Pops, you dance with the devil,
the devil don't change.

545
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,820
Devil changes you.

546
00:41:40,220 --> 00:41:41,420
Some of your lyrics?

547
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,460
That's cute.

548
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,380
This place has been around
about 3 years...

549
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,700
...but they keep moving it
house to house.

550
00:42:13,620 --> 00:42:15,460
This is the tip of the iceberg.

551
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:18,420
Lots of Mexican S & M,
lots of Asian bondage...

552
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:21,060
...all kinds of bestiality,
if you're into that.

553
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:23,980
Don't touch nothing.
You want something, tell Friendly.

554
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,300
Ask him.

555
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:38,420
Don't do that!

556
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:40,060
All right! It's cool!

557
00:42:41,940 --> 00:42:43,100
All right? Okay.

558
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:52,500
Come on, let's go.
All right!

559
00:42:56,820 --> 00:42:59,660
Are you a law enforcement agent
or affillated with law enforcement?

560
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,140
Fuck you, Larry.

561
00:43:01,340 --> 00:43:05,220
Are you a law enforcement agent,
or affillated with law enforcement?

562
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,620
Fuck you, Lar.

563
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,660
You're getting cool there, Welles.

564
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,500
You got your porn zombies here.
Junkies for the hard stuff.

565
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,820
But these basement sales
won't last much longer.

566
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:17,140
One, it's too risky.
And two, everything's on the Net.

567
00:43:17,340 --> 00:43:19,540
Chicken hawks swapping photos
with their modems.

568
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:23,220
Then there's classified ads
with hidden codes, secret couriers...

569
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:25,420
...wires through dummy corporations.

570
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:28,700
If something's illegal, the buyers
are as far away as they can get.

571
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:31,700
Nobody knows what nobody knows,
you know what I mean?

572
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:33,460
How's it going, Samuel?

573
00:43:37,980 --> 00:43:39,500
I'm going to say hi to her.

574
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:41,780
How are you? I love that.

575
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:44,500
It's the Michael Jackson look,
with the zippers.

576
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:16,900
What are these?

577
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,540
Extreme bondage.

578
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:21,380
Rape films.

579
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,860
Sick shit.

580
00:44:24,220 --> 00:44:26,740
Buy five, get one for free.

581
00:44:28,460 --> 00:44:29,980
Anything harder?

582
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,340
There's nothing harder.

583
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:34,220
Snuff?

584
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:39,420
There's no such thing as snuff.

585
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,980
What you see is what I got, mister.

586
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:44,180
Do you know where I can get some?
I have a lot of money.

587
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:45,940
Fuck off.

588
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:33,380
There she is.

589
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,540
There she is.
It's Double Slap Dorothy.

590
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:39,020
There's one chick that
could be a baseball player.

591
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:40,980
The swing on her is unreal.

592
00:45:42,020 --> 00:45:45,460
Some of these S & M and bondage films
you'll see straddle the line.

593
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,340
Foot fetish, orgies, shit films...

594
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:50,020
...hermaphrodites, mutilation.
It's harder than hard-core.

595
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:51,380
But mostly legal.

596
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,420
Stick.

597
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:53,940
One guy sees it and pukes.

598
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,980
Another guy sees it
and he falls in love.

599
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:00,860
This is the guy I was telling you about.
You got the tapes?

600
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,060
A thousand bucks.

601
00:46:03,260 --> 00:46:05,460
-1 200 for the two.
-You told Max 1 000.

602
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:09,820
I know, but this is more fun. I raise
the price, and you get pissed off.

603
00:46:10,020 --> 00:46:12,380
-I thought we had a relationship.
-Is it real?

604
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,220
Sickest shit you'll ever see.

605
00:46:20,020 --> 00:46:21,020
Is that real?

606
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:24,380
That sure as shit looks real.

607
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,300
She's not breathing.

608
00:46:42,140 --> 00:46:43,700
Who makes these films?

609
00:46:43,980 --> 00:46:45,300
I don't know.

610
00:46:45,660 --> 00:46:47,580
Looks like the Philippines.

611
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:54,780
Yeah, definitely the Philippines.

612
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:19,380
Wait a minute.
That's the same girl.

613
00:47:19,580 --> 00:47:20,980
Isn't that the same girl?

614
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,380
Look.

615
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,180
It is the same.

616
00:47:25,380 --> 00:47:26,460
They're fakes.

617
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:30,500
That's great.

618
00:47:32,060 --> 00:47:35,140
Snuff 2: The Resurrection.

619
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,780
Oh, boy.

620
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:39,460
Well, what do you expect for 1 200?

621
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,500
You want a beer or something?
I could use anything.

622
00:47:46,140 --> 00:47:49,260
But I'm sorry, man.
I told you snuff was bogus.

623
00:47:49,460 --> 00:47:52,100
I just wish I would have
gotten you a receipt.

624
00:47:52,740 --> 00:47:53,900
''Hard Spank.''

625
00:47:54,460 --> 00:47:56,340
''Max California.''

626
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:58,420
That's my old band.

627
00:47:58,700 --> 00:47:59,940
We broke up.

628
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:01,140
When?

629
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,220
Maybe about a year ago.

630
00:48:04,540 --> 00:48:06,740
I don't mean any offense...

631
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:09,460
...but what are you doing
mixed up in all this?

632
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:13,020
I'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.

633
00:48:13,220 --> 00:48:15,860
You strike me as being smart enough
to do something else.

634
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,740
Thanks.

635
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:20,340
I wish you owned a record label.

636
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:23,580
Look, it beats pumping gas.

637
00:48:24,180 --> 00:48:26,540
I don't buy it.
I don't endorse it.

638
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:28,500
I just point the way.

639
00:48:29,780 --> 00:48:31,380
You said it gets to you.

640
00:48:31,620 --> 00:48:32,940
Well, hell, yeah!

641
00:48:33,140 --> 00:48:35,500
Parade of losers I see every day?

642
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,460
What choices have I got?

643
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:41,620
The music industry is not exactly
beating down my door.

644
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,380
And what about you, Tom Welles?

645
00:48:45,740 --> 00:48:49,020
You got a ring on your finger.
You got kids?

646
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:50,620
A daughter.

647
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,420
So you got a wife and a daughter...

648
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,500
...and a nice little yellow house...

649
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,620
...and a dog named Shep.

650
00:48:58,900 --> 00:49:01,180
What the hell are you doing here?

651
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,340
Good question.

652
00:49:08,060 --> 00:49:09,940
Do you get turned on
at places like tonight?

653
00:49:11,780 --> 00:49:12,980
No, I am not.

654
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:15,420
You don't exactly
get turned off, either.

655
00:49:17,780 --> 00:49:19,700
Devil's changing you already.

656
00:49:20,100 --> 00:49:21,700
Good night, Max.

657
00:49:59,060 --> 00:50:02,580
This gentleman was asking if anyone
recognizes this girl.

658
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:05,620
Yes.

659
00:50:05,820 --> 00:50:07,220
I remember Mary.

660
00:50:07,420 --> 00:50:09,180
Mary Anne Mathews?

661
00:50:10,540 --> 00:50:14,180
She lived here for only about a month,
if I recall correctly.

662
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:18,100
She didn't return one night.
Do you know what happened to her?

663
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:21,220
Not yet, but I'm looking
into it for her parents.

664
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:24,020
Could you get
that flowered one down for me?

665
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:25,940
That's her suitcase.

666
00:50:26,140 --> 00:50:29,220
I'd forgotten about it
till you showed me her picture.

667
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:33,820
I suppose I always
hoped she'd be back.

668
00:50:34,020 --> 00:50:35,820
She seemed so lost.

669
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:39,660
After a time, all I could do was pray
she'd moved on to better things.

670
00:50:39,860 --> 00:50:41,780
Can you get this suitcase
to her people?

671
00:50:41,980 --> 00:50:43,220
If it's approprlate.

672
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:44,860
Yes, of course. Thank you.

673
00:51:28,260 --> 00:51:30,300
Starlight, star bright

674
00:51:30,500 --> 00:51:32,140
First star I've seen tonight

675
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:34,420
l wish l may, wish l might

676
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:36,980
Have this wish l wish tonight

677
00:51:41,660 --> 00:51:44,980
This number has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

678
00:51:46,740 --> 00:51:49,340
Hello, Hollywood Wax Museum.
Can l help you?

679
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:52,940
This is operator 149.
What city and listing?

680
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,220
l don't know. Hollywood.

681
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,460
A listing for Celebrity Films,
and l need an address.

682
00:51:58,620 --> 00:52:00,980
Please hold for
phone number and address.

683
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:25,380
I was here first.

684
00:52:25,620 --> 00:52:27,180
Sorry, I'll just be a couple minutes.

685
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,020
Eddie Poole?

686
00:52:31,860 --> 00:52:33,260
You a process server?

687
00:52:33,540 --> 00:52:35,900
No, I've been inquirlng around.
Have you seen...

688
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:37,740
...this girl come through here.?

689
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:39,060
You a cop?

690
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:41,100
I'm a member of her family.

691
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,220
You know how much pussy
comes through here?

692
00:52:43,420 --> 00:52:47,100
Please, if you'd just take a look.
It would've been a few years.

693
00:52:55,940 --> 00:52:58,140
Her name is Mary Anne Mathews.

694
00:53:00,740 --> 00:53:02,140
Never seen her.

695
00:53:03,460 --> 00:53:04,660
You sure?

696
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,980
I just looked
at the fucking picture, didn't I?

697
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,300
Now come on.
I got a lot of shit to do.

698
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:15,540
Who's next?

699
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,140
This'll be fine.

700
00:54:27,220 --> 00:54:29,140
What kind of shit are you peddling?

701
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:31,500
Come on. My tapes sell.
People eat the shit up.

702
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:34,340
l had three jerks trying
to return your tapes last month.

703
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:37,660
You know how bad it has to be
for some jackass to come back...

704
00:54:37,860 --> 00:54:40,780
...with a fucking receipt
and try to fucking return it?

705
00:54:40,980 --> 00:54:41,900
How bad?

706
00:54:42,140 --> 00:54:46,100
Get together some upscale product
where the girls still have teeth.

707
00:54:46,740 --> 00:54:49,180
Till then, fuck you!

708
00:54:49,580 --> 00:54:51,100
Does your mother have any teeth?

709
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,460
Because if she does,
send her down, you fuck.

710
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,300
He's not answering.

711
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:24,660
Hey, boss.

712
00:56:24,860 --> 00:56:26,780
There's a case of beer in there.

713
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:32,020
How's your day?

714
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,340
Great.

715
00:56:35,060 --> 00:56:35,900
Is everybody here?

716
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:37,820
Everybody but one of the chicks.

717
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:39,700
-Been watching them?
-Yeah. Why?

718
00:57:52,780 --> 00:57:54,420
Celebrity Films.

719
00:57:55,740 --> 00:57:57,260
I know all about it.

720
00:57:57,500 --> 00:57:58,740
Yeah, you know about what?

721
00:57:58,940 --> 00:58:00,460
About that girl...

722
00:58:00,820 --> 00:58:02,460
...six years ago.

723
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:04,820
I know what you did to her.

724
00:58:05,980 --> 00:58:07,060
Who is this?

725
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:08,700
You murdered her.

726
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:11,020
You and your friends.

727
00:58:11,980 --> 00:58:14,180
l don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

728
00:58:14,380 --> 00:58:15,660
You killed her on film.

729
00:58:16,020 --> 00:58:17,300
And now you're fucked.

730
00:58:17,500 --> 00:58:19,220
You're all fucked.

731
00:58:33,100 --> 00:58:34,380
Come on.

732
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:42,260
Come on, give me something, Eddie.

733
00:58:54,580 --> 00:58:55,700
It's me.

734
00:58:56,620 --> 00:58:57,940
What do you want?

735
00:58:58,100 --> 00:58:59,460
Look, l just got a phone call.

736
00:58:59,660 --> 00:59:02,260
We got to talk.
And we can't talk on the phone.

737
00:59:02,460 --> 00:59:05,300
So one of us
has to get on a plane, all right?

738
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,340
Blow me, you paranoid fuck.

739
00:59:11,660 --> 00:59:13,420
Fuck! Fuck!

740
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,740
So you like to watch, paranoid fuck.

741
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:36,460
Phone is listed under ''D. Velvet''
in Manhattan.

742
00:59:36,660 --> 00:59:37,540
Dino Velvet.

743
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,820
He's a producer/director/weirdo.

744
00:59:41,020 --> 00:59:42,580
He's like the Jim Jarmusch of S & M.

745
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,020
How hard is his stuff?

746
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:45,420
How hard do you want it?

747
00:59:45,620 --> 00:59:47,580
Bondage, fetish, Gothic hard-core.

748
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:49,140
Definitely not for the squeamish.

749
00:59:49,340 --> 00:59:50,860
It's kind of hard to come by.

750
00:59:51,060 --> 00:59:53,500
Mostly out of the back
of bondage magazines.

751
00:59:53,740 --> 00:59:55,020
But he's got fans.

752
00:59:55,220 --> 00:59:57,460
This guy I know, he thinks it's art.

753
00:59:57,620 --> 01:00:00,940
He's told me Velvet will do
commissions if there's enough dough.

754
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:03,020
Nothing illegal, but borderline.

755
01:00:03,220 --> 01:00:06,060
If a guy wants to see
a transvestite in a rubber suit--

756
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:07,380
I got the picture.

757
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:09,620
Max, get in here!

758
01:00:10,620 --> 01:00:11,940
So...

759
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:13,580
...you're going to New York?

760
01:00:13,780 --> 01:00:15,020
Maybe.

761
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,340
Looking like that.

762
01:00:17,900 --> 01:00:19,220
You'll need me.

763
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:22,700
This guy I know, Frenchie, is more
than just a fan of Velvet films.

764
01:00:22,900 --> 01:00:24,500
I could get you in if you want.

765
01:00:25,140 --> 01:00:26,540
For more money, of course.

766
01:00:26,740 --> 01:00:29,460
Plus expenses. I fly first class.

767
01:00:29,620 --> 01:00:31,220
So when are we leaving?

768
01:00:35,860 --> 01:00:37,300
What are you doing?

769
01:00:38,220 --> 01:00:41,460
Man, my first time in
the Big Bad Apple.

770
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:45,940
I told you, don't film me.

771
01:00:46,220 --> 01:00:48,700
Fine, Howard Hughes.

772
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,700
You didn't say it was going to be
this luxurious.

773
01:01:00,940 --> 01:01:01,860
It's the Presidential suite.

774
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,980
You have a comforting
sense of humour.

775
01:01:04,180 --> 01:01:05,940
I'll be a couple of doors down.

776
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:08,980
Tom, I don't know why
we're staying in this fleabag.

777
01:01:09,180 --> 01:01:11,380
People mind
their own business in fleabags.

778
01:01:11,580 --> 01:01:14,660
I'm going out. Dig up
whatever Velvet tapes you can find.

779
01:01:14,860 --> 01:01:15,660
Get receipts.

780
01:01:17,100 --> 01:01:18,180
Yes, sir.

781
01:01:19,380 --> 01:01:22,260
My husband had
five cash accounts he used.

782
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:23,980
Between November...

783
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,820
...of 1 992...

784
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:27,700
...and March...

785
01:01:27,980 --> 01:01:30,100
...of 1 993...

786
01:01:30,300 --> 01:01:33,980
...he wrote one check
out to cash from each account.

787
01:01:35,180 --> 01:01:38,220
My husband never dealt with money
personally.

788
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:39,940
Certainly not cash.

789
01:01:40,140 --> 01:01:42,900
These checks he wrote
are for very odd amounts.

790
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,380
When totaled together...

791
01:01:44,620 --> 01:01:46,220
...the five checks...

792
01:01:46,420 --> 01:01:48,620
...from the five different accounts...

793
01:01:48,820 --> 01:01:51,060
...they equal ก็1 million.

794
01:01:51,700 --> 01:01:53,780
That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.

795
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:55,980
I only mentioned this because...

796
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:59,060
...you asked me to look
for anything unusual.

797
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,700
I've got about ก็5,000 left in cash.

798
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:05,500
I'll need another 50, if you approve
the plan I mentioned earlier.

799
01:02:05,740 --> 01:02:09,140
I'm very close to establishing
the identity of the man in the mask.

800
01:02:09,340 --> 01:02:11,460
I'll have Mr. Longdale arrange it.

801
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,340
How will l get it to you?

802
01:02:13,580 --> 01:02:15,660
If you have a pen,
I'll give you the address.

803
01:02:15,860 --> 01:02:19,180
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

804
01:02:50,060 --> 01:02:53,420
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

805
01:03:20,060 --> 01:03:22,580
Who is this? In the mask, who is he?

806
01:03:23,740 --> 01:03:25,500
Come on, wake up. Who is this?

807
01:03:25,740 --> 01:03:29,260
One of the lunatics Dino always uses.
He's in a bunch of these.

808
01:03:29,460 --> 01:03:30,340
What's his name?

809
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:33,180
I don't know. That's his whole thing.

810
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:35,380
He always wears a mask.

811
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:37,140
He calls himself ''Machete.''

812
01:03:37,340 --> 01:03:38,700
No, ''Machine.''

813
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,260
He calls himself Machine.

814
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:44,980
He's a lover, man.

815
01:03:45,140 --> 01:03:48,140
Definitely loves what he does
for a living.

816
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:51,060
I wish I could say the same about you.

817
01:04:01,340 --> 01:04:02,780
Yes, yes.

818
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,140
I can see they
really appreclate my style here.

819
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:09,940
I kind of blend in with the crowd here.

820
01:04:10,100 --> 01:04:11,180
If you didn't notice.

821
01:04:11,380 --> 01:04:13,620
Like these ladies here,
they like my style.

822
01:04:19,180 --> 01:04:19,980
Who is it?

823
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:22,060
Yes, this is Max California.

824
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:24,860
I called earlier.
I'm a friend of Frenchie's from L.A.

825
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:27,860
My partner and I
would like to speak to Mr. Velvet.

826
01:04:28,060 --> 01:04:29,340
He's not here.

827
01:04:29,980 --> 01:04:32,020
We're here to give him
a large sum of money.

828
01:04:32,220 --> 01:04:33,660
If he's not interested, we'll split.

829
01:04:51,580 --> 01:04:53,380
I don't know what you're talk about.

830
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,940
Can't you just answer
my simple question?

831
01:04:58,460 --> 01:05:01,940
I asked you a question!
Where the fuck is Laura?!

832
01:05:02,380 --> 01:05:05,060
That's what I've been asking you
the last 1 0 minutes.

833
01:05:05,260 --> 01:05:07,660
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

834
01:05:08,140 --> 01:05:09,180
You idiot!

835
01:05:09,420 --> 01:05:11,340
Going to shoot in two days?

836
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:13,700
Man, you're spending my money.

837
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:15,820
Yeah, you better do that.

838
01:05:16,380 --> 01:05:18,060
Fucking asshole.

839
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:20,940
It's an honour to meet you.
Thank you for seeing us.

840
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,500
God.

841
01:05:26,060 --> 01:05:27,740
So, what can I do you for?

842
01:05:27,980 --> 01:05:32,660
We'd like to commission a film.
A Dino Velvet original, one of a kind.

843
01:05:33,180 --> 01:05:34,460
That's right.

844
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:37,100
I'm a huge admirer of yours.

845
01:05:37,300 --> 01:05:39,500
God, I love flattery.

846
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:42,900
You're a genius, Mr. Velvet.
A goddamn genius.

847
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:45,300
The only one still transferring film
to video.

848
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,540
Nobody really appreclates
that kind of integrity anymore.

849
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:51,180
The grain and the gritty look you get.

850
01:05:54,380 --> 01:05:55,660
Which is your favourite?

851
01:05:56,140 --> 01:05:57,220
If I had to choose...

852
01:05:57,420 --> 01:05:59,180
...it'd be Choke or Devil.

853
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:00,980
The subliminal imagery...

854
01:06:01,180 --> 01:06:03,860
...in Choke is what
really gets under your skin.

855
01:06:04,820 --> 01:06:08,860
Well, Devil frightened me
as much as it excited me...

856
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:11,660
...but I'd be hard-pressed
to choose a favourite.

857
01:06:16,020 --> 01:06:18,740
What kind of a budget
are we talking about?

858
01:06:19,820 --> 01:06:21,420
Five thousand now.

859
01:06:22,260 --> 01:06:23,820
Five thousand upon delivery.

860
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:26,260
Two women. One white, one black.

861
01:06:26,700 --> 01:06:28,620
Hard bondage, of course.

862
01:06:28,980 --> 01:06:30,740
Other than that, trusting your...

863
01:06:30,940 --> 01:06:32,940
...artistic interpretation...

864
01:06:33,140 --> 01:06:35,380
...I only have two stipulations.

865
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,500
Challenge me.

866
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,820
I want to watch you work.

867
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:48,340
You don't want a franchise, do you?

868
01:06:48,820 --> 01:06:51,700
Steal the recipe for my secret...

869
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,980
...hot sauce?

870
01:06:54,740 --> 01:06:55,980
No.

871
01:06:57,940 --> 01:06:59,100
That's good.

872
01:06:59,340 --> 01:07:01,260
I appreclate that.

873
01:07:06,380 --> 01:07:07,780
Second stipulation.

874
01:07:07,980 --> 01:07:09,620
The other performer...

875
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:12,020
...has to be...

876
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:14,100
...that animal you use.

877
01:07:14,260 --> 01:07:15,820
The man in the mask.

878
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,540
Machine.

879
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:26,780
I don't know.

880
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,420
He might be interested.

881
01:07:30,540 --> 01:07:33,620
But I think it'll cost you another...

882
01:07:36,020 --> 01:07:37,980
...five to seven grand.

883
01:07:38,380 --> 01:07:41,100
I can arrange something
really special for ten.

884
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:42,860
We can do that.

885
01:07:43,060 --> 01:07:44,460
Good enough for me.

886
01:07:46,060 --> 01:07:49,900
I'll just have to put
my thinking cap on.

887
01:07:53,660 --> 01:07:56,820
I'm going to keep this as a deposit.

888
01:07:56,980 --> 01:07:59,940
You make sure you call me
after 1 0 o'clock tonight.

889
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:01,740
1 0 o'clock.

890
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,660
You know, you have a very special...

891
01:08:07,860 --> 01:08:09,780
...very beautiful face.

892
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,140
The way light hits it.

893
01:08:12,820 --> 01:08:14,580
I'd like to shoot you.

894
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:16,620
You don't mind?

895
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,180
I'm camera-shy.

896
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:22,260
You trust me to take your money,
but not your picture?

897
01:08:22,460 --> 01:08:24,780
Those are two different kinds of trust.

898
01:08:25,300 --> 01:08:27,340
I hope we can do business.

899
01:08:35,860 --> 01:08:39,020
Hoyt Avenue, Brooklyn, 3 o'clock.

900
01:08:41,740 --> 01:08:42,860
I'll be there.

901
01:08:45,900 --> 01:08:48,180
I got something to tend to. Thanks.

902
01:08:48,980 --> 01:08:51,180
So are we in the movie business?

903
01:08:52,340 --> 01:08:53,180
That's for you.

904
01:08:53,380 --> 01:08:54,180
What is it?

905
01:08:54,380 --> 01:08:56,300
Money.
People use it to purchase goods.

906
01:08:56,780 --> 01:08:58,860
That's awfully generous
and everything--

907
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:01,380
It's not mine.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

908
01:09:01,580 --> 01:09:05,140
There's a plane ticket and the flight
you can catch to L.A. tonight.

909
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:07,180
This is as far as I want you to go.

910
01:09:07,380 --> 01:09:08,980
What are you talking about?

911
01:09:09,180 --> 01:09:10,740
We're a team. We're partners.

912
01:09:11,020 --> 01:09:15,580
Max, I'm sure you realize
these people we're dealing with...

913
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:18,020
...they're extremely disturbed.

914
01:09:18,220 --> 01:09:21,180
That's why you need me.
I know disturbed. Look at me.

915
01:09:21,420 --> 01:09:24,220
You did a great job here.
It's time for you to go home.

916
01:09:24,460 --> 01:09:26,060
But this is our big case.

917
01:09:26,860 --> 01:09:29,340
Tom, I know what's going on, okay?

918
01:09:29,820 --> 01:09:31,020
Okay, what?

919
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:33,940
Dino and Machine and Eddie
made a snuff film, right?

920
01:09:34,100 --> 01:09:36,060
I can't figure out why you're involved.

921
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:37,660
What, maybe the victim--?

922
01:09:37,900 --> 01:09:39,220
First, who said you're right?

923
01:09:39,420 --> 01:09:41,620
Second, who said
anything about a victim?

924
01:09:42,060 --> 01:09:44,060
Only 3 rules in life, Tom Welles.

925
01:09:44,300 --> 01:09:47,420
One, there's always a victim.
And two, don't be it.

926
01:09:47,620 --> 01:09:48,420
And three?

927
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:49,740
I forgot three.

928
01:09:49,940 --> 01:09:51,980
Good, I want you to forget everything.

929
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,380
I want you to get on a plane,
go back to L.A. and forget it all.

930
01:09:56,780 --> 01:09:58,460
I get a lot of calls for work
on the West Coast.

931
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:01,060
I'd like to call you again.
I could use help.

932
01:10:01,260 --> 01:10:03,460
You're going to look me up and call me?

933
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:07,420
I could use your help. I meant it
when I said I think you're smart.

934
01:10:07,660 --> 01:10:09,700
I'm not patronizing you.

935
01:10:09,900 --> 01:10:11,180
Well, thanks.

936
01:10:11,540 --> 01:10:14,220
All right.
Well, you take care, Max California.

937
01:10:20,220 --> 01:10:23,060
All right, Tom Welles.
Devil's waiting on you.

938
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,140
There you are.

939
01:11:44,460 --> 01:11:46,380
Come and join us.

940
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,180
Hello, Machine.

941
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:01,100
Love your work.

942
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:08,940
Did you bring the money?

943
01:12:10,100 --> 01:12:11,500
It's right here.

944
01:12:11,700 --> 01:12:12,660
Good.

945
01:12:14,220 --> 01:12:15,500
Where are the women?

946
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:17,100
Women...

947
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:20,060
...they're always late.

948
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:27,740
What are these for?

949
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:30,580
They're just props.

950
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:32,700
Nice, aren't they?

951
01:12:32,980 --> 01:12:36,860
Machine and I were just talking
about the beauty of knives.

952
01:12:40,140 --> 01:12:43,020
My guests have arrived!

953
01:12:45,140 --> 01:12:46,900
Mister W., would you be so kind...

954
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,980
...as to remove
any firearms from your person?

955
01:12:50,700 --> 01:12:51,660
What are you doing?

956
01:12:52,780 --> 01:12:55,500
I hate to repeat myself.
It makes me look so stupid.

957
01:12:56,060 --> 01:12:57,220
Slowly.

958
01:12:57,420 --> 01:12:59,660
Please, show me your gun.

959
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:02,100
Nice and easy!

960
01:13:03,420 --> 01:13:05,540
That's right. Easy.

961
01:13:05,740 --> 01:13:07,340
Good.

962
01:13:07,660 --> 01:13:10,500
Now empty those bullets onto the table.

963
01:13:10,700 --> 01:13:12,100
Very carefully.

964
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:15,180
-I don't know why you think--
-Shut up, you fuck!

965
01:13:15,700 --> 01:13:19,740
I'll put an arrow right through
your goddamn throat, you understand?

966
01:13:25,620 --> 01:13:26,860
That's him.

967
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:29,300
Last bullet. That's last one.

968
01:13:29,980 --> 01:13:31,060
Good boy.

969
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,780
Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.

970
01:13:34,220 --> 01:13:35,580
Yes, sir.

971
01:13:35,820 --> 01:13:37,020
Machine!

972
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:46,420
I didn't know
what to make of you at first.

973
01:13:48,500 --> 01:13:52,460
And you certainly had Eddie here
on pins and needles.

974
01:13:53,940 --> 01:13:56,860
Lo and behold,
from right out of the blue came...

975
01:13:57,100 --> 01:14:01,260
...an old business acquaintance of ours
to explain everything.

976
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:04,820
Satan ex machina.

977
01:14:05,620 --> 01:14:08,180
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

978
01:14:10,980 --> 01:14:12,060
Let's get this over with.

979
01:14:12,300 --> 01:14:14,300
Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

980
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:19,340
What I could do
with faces like these on film.

981
01:14:20,020 --> 01:14:23,660
But on second thought,
why would I need their faces?

982
01:14:24,660 --> 01:14:25,940
You're going to listen to me.

983
01:14:26,140 --> 01:14:27,660
You're going to get that film.

984
01:14:27,860 --> 01:14:30,700
You're going to
bring it back here, give it to me.

985
01:14:31,100 --> 01:14:35,060
Just so we make this
as efficient as possible...

986
01:14:35,260 --> 01:14:37,820
...there is an incentive.

987
01:14:48,340 --> 01:14:50,420
He's got nothing to do with this.

988
01:14:50,620 --> 01:14:52,300
He doesn't know anything.

989
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:56,180
Can't you guess
what I'm about to say next?!

990
01:14:57,820 --> 01:15:00,100
If you don't bring me that film...

991
01:15:00,300 --> 01:15:02,540
...we're going to kill him, fuck him...

992
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:04,340
...and film it.

993
01:15:07,580 --> 01:15:09,780
If that's not enough for you...

994
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:12,700
...we're going to go after your family.

995
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:16,940
I'll get the film.

996
01:15:19,060 --> 01:15:20,340
Good boy.

997
01:15:20,500 --> 01:15:22,060
You're being very cooperative.

998
01:15:22,580 --> 01:15:25,340
Mr. Longdale here
will keep you company.

999
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:27,340
Why me?

1000
01:15:27,540 --> 01:15:29,900
Because I don't like you, Mr. Longdale.

1001
01:15:39,220 --> 01:15:40,700
Mr. W...

1002
01:15:44,060 --> 01:15:45,420
...hurry back.

1003
01:15:49,780 --> 01:15:52,060
Since I met you,
there isn't much you've done...

1004
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,820
...that I haven't been party to.

1005
01:15:54,060 --> 01:15:56,940
None of this would be happening
if you'd given up and walked away.

1006
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,660
Or better yet,
not taken the job in the first place.

1007
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:02,180
I never expected you to get this far.

1008
01:16:02,380 --> 01:16:04,300
I hired you because you're young...

1009
01:16:04,500 --> 01:16:06,300
...and completely out of your league.

1010
01:16:06,540 --> 01:16:08,940
But I underestimated your ambition.

1011
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:11,740
You took one look
at the Christian compound.

1012
01:16:12,660 --> 01:16:13,620
It was heady, wasn't it?

1013
01:16:13,820 --> 01:16:15,620
You weren't just peeking through
the gates this time.

1014
01:16:15,820 --> 01:16:17,740
No, Mrs. Christian welcomed you in.

1015
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:21,300
Do you think people like
the Christians hire people like us...

1016
01:16:21,500 --> 01:16:23,660
...as an invitation
to their dinner parties?

1017
01:16:23,860 --> 01:16:25,460
No, we're there to clean up the mess...

1018
01:16:25,660 --> 01:16:28,060
...to wipe their royal asses.

1019
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:29,900
You were asked to buy a snuff film.

1020
01:16:30,100 --> 01:16:33,140
They couldn't find one,
so you paid them to make you one?

1021
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,020
Isn't that what happened?

1022
01:16:35,500 --> 01:16:38,020
She was alive
till you paid to have her murdered?

1023
01:16:38,220 --> 01:16:40,020
How much did Christian
pay for your conscience?

1024
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:41,020
A million?

1025
01:16:41,780 --> 01:16:43,340
I've been well compensated.

1026
01:16:43,540 --> 01:16:45,340
But you, I bought cheap.

1027
01:16:46,860 --> 01:16:50,220
Just because Mrs. Christian
praised your discretion...

1028
01:16:50,420 --> 01:16:51,860
...you sat on evidence of murder.

1029
01:16:52,020 --> 01:16:53,580
Dragged your friend, family...

1030
01:16:53,780 --> 01:16:56,220
...into some old graveyard...

1031
01:16:56,420 --> 01:17:00,220
...to dig up a dead girl with no name
that nobody cares about or remembers.

1032
01:17:00,460 --> 01:17:01,700
Mary Anne Mathews.

1033
01:17:01,900 --> 01:17:03,260
That was her name.

1034
01:17:03,500 --> 01:17:04,820
Her mother remembers her.

1035
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:06,380
I'm bored with this.

1036
01:17:06,700 --> 01:17:08,820
You know the only difference
between us?

1037
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:12,140
I will survive this and profit by it,
whereas you...

1038
01:17:12,340 --> 01:17:13,420
...you will not.

1039
01:17:13,620 --> 01:17:15,180
Now get the film.

1040
01:17:20,540 --> 01:17:22,180
Did you watch it with him?

1041
01:17:22,380 --> 01:17:23,220
What?

1042
01:17:23,380 --> 01:17:25,540
The snuff film.
Did you watch it with him?

1043
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:27,980
This isn't helping your friend.
Get the film.

1044
01:17:28,180 --> 01:17:29,140
Did it get him off?

1045
01:17:29,660 --> 01:17:30,980
Mr. Christian?

1046
01:17:31,180 --> 01:17:34,380
Watching them cut her up like that?
Did he jerk off to it?

1047
01:17:34,580 --> 01:17:36,700
Did you hold his cock?
Give him the hand job...

1048
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,700
...while Mary Anne Mathews was dying?

1049
01:17:39,860 --> 01:17:42,500
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to understand!

1050
01:17:42,700 --> 01:17:44,860
What did he want with a snuff film?!

1051
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:46,140
You're asking why?

1052
01:17:46,380 --> 01:17:48,220
Yes, why? Why?!

1053
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:50,300
Why did he want a film...

1054
01:17:50,540 --> 01:17:52,940
...of a little girl being butchered?!

1055
01:17:54,220 --> 01:17:55,540
Because he could.

1056
01:17:56,140 --> 01:17:57,940
He did it because he could.

1057
01:17:59,900 --> 01:18:01,300
What other reason
were you looking for?

1058
01:18:05,900 --> 01:18:07,180
Now.

1059
01:18:20,860 --> 01:18:22,060
Here.

1060
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,180
Shoot me.

1061
01:18:32,740 --> 01:18:35,100
Mr. Welles, the film, please.

1062
01:18:36,140 --> 01:18:37,380
Let him go first.

1063
01:18:37,580 --> 01:18:39,980
Do whatever you want to me,
but let him go.

1064
01:18:40,180 --> 01:18:42,380
Very well. Set him free, Machine.

1065
01:19:17,580 --> 01:19:19,460
-Is that it?
-That's it.

1066
01:19:19,660 --> 01:19:20,780
Bravo.

1067
01:19:22,180 --> 01:19:24,020
I don't think you want to miss this...

1068
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:25,780
...Mr. Welles.

1069
01:19:34,700 --> 01:19:36,620
So it ends.

1070
01:19:38,500 --> 01:19:40,980
As if she never existed.

1071
01:19:41,460 --> 01:19:44,860
Don't blame yourself.
You were in way over your head.

1072
01:19:45,420 --> 01:19:47,220
You motherfuckers.

1073
01:19:49,380 --> 01:19:51,820
You smalltime motherfuckers.

1074
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:55,260
I want to know something:

1075
01:19:55,700 --> 01:19:59,540
Why you're still smalltime with a
million dollars to spread around?!

1076
01:20:00,020 --> 01:20:00,940
Million?

1077
01:20:01,140 --> 01:20:03,940
Yeah! That's what Christian
gave Longdale!

1078
01:20:04,660 --> 01:20:06,420
That's what he gave you, right?

1079
01:20:06,580 --> 01:20:07,860
A million in cash?

1080
01:20:08,180 --> 01:20:10,380
You stupid fucking trash!

1081
01:20:10,580 --> 01:20:14,380
What the hell--
Is he talking dollars here?

1082
01:20:14,580 --> 01:20:16,140
No, he's lying.

1083
01:20:16,340 --> 01:20:17,620
Did you fuck me?

1084
01:20:18,940 --> 01:20:20,140
Did you fuck me on this?

1085
01:20:20,340 --> 01:20:21,420
Of course not, Edward!

1086
01:20:21,620 --> 01:20:23,620
Then what's he talking about?

1087
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:24,940
He's saying that...

1088
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,620
...Longdale fucked us...

1089
01:20:26,820 --> 01:20:29,660
...which is so totally,
completely bizarre.

1090
01:20:30,340 --> 01:20:31,220
Stay back.

1091
01:20:31,820 --> 01:20:32,900
Stay away from me.

1092
01:20:33,620 --> 01:20:34,980
Put the bow down!

1093
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:36,980
I told you not to trust the prick.

1094
01:20:37,220 --> 01:20:39,780
Mr. Longdale, if there's no honour...

1095
01:20:39,980 --> 01:20:41,780
...among perverts and pornographers...

1096
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:43,980
...the whole business would fall apart.

1097
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:47,700
Because there's no records,
no contracts, no legal recourse.

1098
01:20:47,980 --> 01:20:49,540
So if someone...

1099
01:20:49,740 --> 01:20:50,900
...cheats us...

1100
01:20:51,100 --> 01:20:52,700
...that person can't be trusted.

1101
01:20:52,900 --> 01:20:55,460
That person could turn us in,
have us killed.

1102
01:20:56,660 --> 01:21:00,300
So we don't have a choice,
do we, Mr. Longdale?

1103
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:03,380
I want this to be over.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

1104
01:21:03,580 --> 01:21:05,100
Eddie, take your gun out.

1105
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:06,500
Fuck you.

1106
01:21:06,700 --> 01:21:08,820
Take it out now! And drop it.

1107
01:21:08,980 --> 01:21:10,580
Or I will shoot.

1108
01:21:10,860 --> 01:21:12,740
Don't be stupid, Edward.

1109
01:21:17,940 --> 01:21:19,460
Kick it in my direction. Hard.

1110
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:25,460
Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.

1111
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:31,180
Action.

1112
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,100
This is wrong.

1113
01:21:44,300 --> 01:21:45,980
Something's wrong.

1114
01:21:46,740 --> 01:21:48,140
God, not like this.

1115
01:21:50,020 --> 01:21:52,180
I am supposed to have...

1116
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,740
...something more cinematic.

1117
01:21:55,340 --> 01:21:56,980
Kill them, Machine.

1118
01:21:58,260 --> 01:21:59,820
Kill them all.

1119
01:22:07,060 --> 01:22:08,180
Machine!

1120
01:22:47,860 --> 01:22:48,660
Stop, Eddie!

1121
01:22:50,180 --> 01:22:51,180
I swear to Christ!

1122
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,820
I'll shoot you in the back!

1123
01:22:54,540 --> 01:22:55,700
Take off the mask.

1124
01:22:57,700 --> 01:22:59,300
Take off the fucking mask!

1125
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,460
He's only got one bullet!

1126
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:40,940
Amy, listen carefully.

1127
01:24:41,140 --> 01:24:43,380
-Tom, where are you?
-Amy, just listen.

1128
01:24:43,580 --> 01:24:45,780
Take Cindy. Get out of the house now.

1129
01:24:45,980 --> 01:24:48,300
Go to where we spent
Fourth of July weekend.

1130
01:24:48,500 --> 01:24:51,220
-Why? What's wrong?
-Amy, please. l can't.

1131
01:24:51,380 --> 01:24:53,380
I'll be there in three hours.

1132
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:55,540
I'm on my way! Go now!

1133
01:24:55,940 --> 01:24:57,780
Tom, you're scaring me.

1134
01:24:57,980 --> 01:24:59,700
Please, Amy, just do it!

1135
01:25:00,580 --> 01:25:02,580
Okay, bye. I'm going.

1136
01:25:10,100 --> 01:25:11,860
Mrs. Christian, it's Tom Welles.

1137
01:25:12,020 --> 01:25:13,300
Longdale is dead.

1138
01:25:13,500 --> 01:25:15,500
He was killed by the men
who made the film.

1139
01:25:15,700 --> 01:25:18,740
He hired them for your husband.
Kept most of the million.

1140
01:25:18,940 --> 01:25:20,660
The film is real!

1141
01:25:20,860 --> 01:25:22,100
They killed that girl!

1142
01:25:24,020 --> 01:25:25,340
Mrs. Christian?

1143
01:25:25,540 --> 01:25:28,260
I'm still here, Mr. Welles.

1144
01:25:28,460 --> 01:25:29,820
I'm sorry. I know this must be--

1145
01:25:30,020 --> 01:25:31,500
Are you in dangerฃฟ.

1146
01:25:31,700 --> 01:25:34,340
We'll go to the police.
I'll tell you everything tonight.

1147
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:36,260
We can call the police in the morning.

1148
01:25:36,500 --> 01:25:37,460
All right.

1149
01:25:37,900 --> 01:25:38,980
Eight o'clock?

1150
01:25:39,180 --> 01:25:40,940
Yes, eight o'clock is fine.

1151
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:42,260
Do you know...

1152
01:25:42,500 --> 01:25:46,340
...what the poor girl's name was?

1153
01:25:48,580 --> 01:25:50,420
Mary Anne Mathews.

1154
01:25:54,020 --> 01:25:54,980
Thank you.

1155
01:25:55,340 --> 01:25:57,300
Mr. Welles, goodbye.

1156
01:26:52,740 --> 01:26:54,500
Are you okay?

1157
01:26:56,340 --> 01:26:57,540
Are you?

1158
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:00,700
Why haven't you called me?

1159
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,420
Why did you disappear
off the face of the Earth?

1160
01:27:07,540 --> 01:27:09,100
You're bleeding.

1161
01:27:09,620 --> 01:27:11,180
Are those handcuffs?

1162
01:27:11,380 --> 01:27:13,140
Were you locked up?

1163
01:27:14,060 --> 01:27:16,740
Kept from a phone? What happened?

1164
01:27:16,940 --> 01:27:17,940
Start talking, Tom.

1165
01:27:18,140 --> 01:27:21,900
Because if you want to stay married,
you can't treat me this way!

1166
01:27:22,700 --> 01:27:23,860
You're right.

1167
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:25,940
Everything you say is right.

1168
01:27:28,220 --> 01:27:30,620
That won't do it.
That's not enough, Tom.

1169
01:27:30,820 --> 01:27:31,940
Not anymore.

1170
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:35,540
I'm not going to let
anything happen to us.

1171
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:37,780
Look where we are!

1172
01:27:38,300 --> 01:27:40,980
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself! Look!

1173
01:27:41,780 --> 01:27:43,220
You son of a bitch.

1174
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:47,020
You don't even have any idea
what you're putting me through.

1175
01:27:48,860 --> 01:27:52,100
What was I supposed to think
happened to you?

1176
01:27:57,620 --> 01:27:59,540
We're going to stay here a few days.

1177
01:27:59,740 --> 01:28:01,100
It's just a few days.

1178
01:28:01,300 --> 01:28:02,580
I'm sorry.

1179
01:28:02,740 --> 01:28:04,020
There's no other way around this.

1180
01:28:04,180 --> 01:28:06,380
Okay, look. I swear, I swear...

1181
01:28:08,580 --> 01:28:11,500
...I won't let anything happen to us.
I'll take care of it.

1182
01:28:11,700 --> 01:28:13,300
I swear it.

1183
01:28:14,220 --> 01:28:15,700
I swear it.

1184
01:28:17,580 --> 01:28:19,620
Now I have to go back out.

1185
01:28:20,340 --> 01:28:21,540
Where?

1186
01:28:24,820 --> 01:28:26,820
I have to see Mrs. Christian.

1187
01:28:27,660 --> 01:28:29,580
She's the only witness.

1188
01:28:30,620 --> 01:28:31,820
To what?

1189
01:28:34,140 --> 01:28:35,940
We're going to be okay.

1190
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:40,540
We're going to be okay.

1191
01:28:54,180 --> 01:28:56,300
Tom Welles.
Mrs. Christian's expecting me.

1192
01:28:56,500 --> 01:28:58,380
Yes, she left instructions.

1193
01:28:59,060 --> 01:29:01,540
I have to see her now.
It's extremely urgent.

1194
01:29:02,100 --> 01:29:05,940
Mrs. Christian chose to take
her own life this afternoon, Mr. Welles.

1195
01:29:10,980 --> 01:29:12,260
But I just....

1196
01:29:12,860 --> 01:29:14,420
No, no, I just....

1197
01:29:16,020 --> 01:29:17,380
I just spoke to her.

1198
01:29:17,580 --> 01:29:20,620
Her instructions were
that this first envelope...

1199
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:22,860
...is for Mary's family.

1200
01:29:23,140 --> 01:29:25,620
She wrote that you'd understand
what that meant.

1201
01:29:26,500 --> 01:29:28,620
And the second envelope is for you.

1202
01:29:30,740 --> 01:29:34,460
Services will be held next week,
if you'd like to attend.

1203
01:29:36,020 --> 01:29:37,620
I am sorry, sir.

1204
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:39,460
Good night, sir.

1205
01:30:13,660 --> 01:30:15,060
What are you doing?

1206
01:30:17,780 --> 01:30:19,380
I have to go back.

1207
01:30:30,220 --> 01:30:31,940
Whatever it is...

1208
01:30:32,260 --> 01:30:34,060
...wherever you were...

1209
01:30:34,260 --> 01:30:36,340
...just forget about it.

1210
01:30:36,540 --> 01:30:38,140
You stay here.

1211
01:30:38,660 --> 01:30:40,140
I can't.

1212
01:30:43,060 --> 01:30:46,100
And risk us? Risk your family? Why?

1213
01:30:47,460 --> 01:30:49,820
There's no one left
to finish this but me.

1214
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:52,980
I'll call you when it's safe to go home.

1215
01:30:55,580 --> 01:30:58,060
We may not be there
when you get back.

1216
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:14,900
Cindy's education, and a lot more.

1217
01:31:24,380 --> 01:31:25,780
I love you.

1218
01:32:15,620 --> 01:32:17,780
Put your hands on your head.
Down on your knees.

1219
01:32:19,740 --> 01:32:21,660
You think I'm fucking around?

1220
01:32:24,620 --> 01:32:25,740
Hurts, doesn't it?

1221
01:32:25,940 --> 01:32:27,300
What the fuck do you want?

1222
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,540
Who's Machine?

1223
01:32:28,740 --> 01:32:29,900
Where does he live?

1224
01:32:30,580 --> 01:32:31,740
I don't know.

1225
01:32:31,940 --> 01:32:33,340
I want his name.

1226
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,900
I don't know his name.

1227
01:32:38,780 --> 01:32:40,900
I will never get tired of hurting you.

1228
01:32:41,100 --> 01:32:44,980
I don't know his name. He shows up
in his mask, he leaves in his mask.

1229
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:47,020
He's from New York somewhere.

1230
01:32:52,220 --> 01:32:53,500
Get in the car.

1231
01:32:55,500 --> 01:32:56,300
Why?

1232
01:32:56,860 --> 01:32:59,060
You're going to show me
where you killed her.

1233
01:32:59,980 --> 01:33:01,100
Fuck you.

1234
01:33:03,260 --> 01:33:05,100
All right, you fuck.

1235
01:33:18,580 --> 01:33:20,740
What did you do before
you brought her here?

1236
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:24,300
Tell her how beautiful she was...

1237
01:33:25,460 --> 01:33:27,540
...how you'd make her a big star?

1238
01:33:32,740 --> 01:33:34,140
Talk her up?

1239
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:40,180
What the fuck do you want from me?

1240
01:33:44,300 --> 01:33:45,580
I want to know.

1241
01:33:48,980 --> 01:33:50,300
You want to know?

1242
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:55,500
She was nothing.

1243
01:33:55,820 --> 01:33:57,260
A little piece of pussy off the street.

1244
01:33:57,460 --> 01:33:59,860
Girl like that disappears,
nobody gives a shit.

1245
01:34:01,380 --> 01:34:03,580
Yeah, I talked her up.

1246
01:34:03,820 --> 01:34:07,060
Told her everything she wanted to hear.
I told her she'd be a big star...

1247
01:34:07,220 --> 01:34:10,420
...she'd make a lot of money,
and all the rest of the bullshit.

1248
01:34:10,580 --> 01:34:14,420
By the time I was finished, she was
all excited about her big screen test.

1249
01:34:16,300 --> 01:34:17,980
I called up Dino...

1250
01:34:18,180 --> 01:34:21,020
...he and Machine flew out here.
We had a little party.

1251
01:34:22,860 --> 01:34:24,340
What else you want to know?

1252
01:34:25,460 --> 01:34:26,940
You saw the film, right?

1253
01:34:27,780 --> 01:34:29,180
You know the ending.

1254
01:34:31,260 --> 01:34:33,420
Nobody else saw you bring her in?

1255
01:34:35,900 --> 01:34:38,660
Who's going to see?
Place is a fucking shithole.

1256
01:34:42,100 --> 01:34:43,860
I brought her in and she...

1257
01:34:45,620 --> 01:34:48,020
...saw Machine
standing in the corner.

1258
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:50,940
She started crying...

1259
01:34:52,860 --> 01:34:54,900
...making these little noises.

1260
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:59,540
So I slapped her around a bit
just to shut her up.

1261
01:35:00,140 --> 01:35:01,260
Dino...

1262
01:35:01,460 --> 01:35:03,380
...fed her a bunch of pills.

1263
01:35:04,940 --> 01:35:07,380
Machine put down the plastic over here.

1264
01:35:10,540 --> 01:35:12,340
Just started cutting her up.

1265
01:35:16,140 --> 01:35:17,940
That's it. She's dead.

1266
01:35:18,660 --> 01:35:21,580
She's been dead a long time.
Nobody gives a shit but you.

1267
01:35:35,700 --> 01:35:37,380
You wanted to know.

1268
01:35:37,780 --> 01:35:39,300
Now you know.

1269
01:35:41,220 --> 01:35:42,700
You were in here.

1270
01:35:42,900 --> 01:35:46,340
You watched Mary Anne
bleed to death from here.

1271
01:35:47,820 --> 01:35:48,780
Why?

1272
01:35:50,580 --> 01:35:52,180
Why did you watch?

1273
01:35:53,220 --> 01:35:54,460
I felt like it.

1274
01:35:56,500 --> 01:35:58,260
I never saw nobody get done before.

1275
01:35:59,260 --> 01:36:00,220
Why?

1276
01:36:01,460 --> 01:36:03,700
Did you get hard? Did you come?

1277
01:36:03,860 --> 01:36:06,260
No. It made me sick.

1278
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:08,100
But what do I give a shit...

1279
01:36:08,300 --> 01:36:12,300
...if some rich fucking wacko wants
to beat off to something like that?

1280
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:13,780
Stay down!

1281
01:36:16,060 --> 01:36:17,900
It was something I did for money.

1282
01:36:20,460 --> 01:36:22,380
I needed the fucking money.

1283
01:36:23,180 --> 01:36:24,540
Where is she?

1284
01:36:24,740 --> 01:36:26,220
Where did you put her body?

1285
01:36:26,580 --> 01:36:28,300
I buried it in the woods.

1286
01:36:29,620 --> 01:36:30,580
You're not going to find it.

1287
01:36:30,780 --> 01:36:32,900
If you find it, so what?
What do you got?

1288
01:36:33,100 --> 01:36:35,260
You got a girl's skeleton, that's it.

1289
01:36:35,460 --> 01:36:37,460
Without the film, you got nothing.

1290
01:36:38,340 --> 01:36:40,220
So all you can do is cut me loose.

1291
01:36:40,420 --> 01:36:42,740
Because without the film
you got nothing--

1292
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,460
What the fuck are you doing?!

1293
01:36:44,660 --> 01:36:46,540
-Put your hands behind your back.
-Fuck you!

1294
01:36:47,380 --> 01:36:49,700
Put your hands behind your back!

1295
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:51,340
All right.

1296
01:36:56,340 --> 01:36:58,340
What the fuck are you doing?

1297
01:37:03,980 --> 01:37:05,740
I'm going to kill you.

1298
01:37:07,220 --> 01:37:08,940
I'm going to kill you.

1299
01:37:10,620 --> 01:37:13,820
And I'm going to leave you here
just like you left her.

1300
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,420
You're not going to kill me.

1301
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,340
You don't have it in you.

1302
01:37:20,660 --> 01:37:23,340
What are you going to do?
Shoot me with your own gun?

1303
01:37:23,540 --> 01:37:24,900
Registered in your name?

1304
01:37:27,060 --> 01:37:29,700
You really thought this through,
didn't you, genius?

1305
01:37:29,900 --> 01:37:32,180
You'll have to dig
the bullets out of my head.

1306
01:37:32,380 --> 01:37:34,020
That'll be nice.

1307
01:37:35,940 --> 01:37:37,660
Or you could dig a hole.

1308
01:37:38,540 --> 01:37:39,740
Dig it with your own hands...

1309
01:37:39,940 --> 01:37:41,860
...and bury me next to your girlfriend.

1310
01:37:42,380 --> 01:37:43,580
Go ahead.

1311
01:37:44,220 --> 01:37:45,300
Pull the fucking trigger.

1312
01:37:45,780 --> 01:37:46,660
Go ahead.

1313
01:37:46,860 --> 01:37:48,940
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, do it.

1314
01:37:49,140 --> 01:37:50,540
You faggot!

1315
01:37:52,620 --> 01:37:54,580
What do you want me to do?
Start crying?

1316
01:37:54,780 --> 01:37:57,140
Like a baby?
''I'm so sorry I killed the girl.''

1317
01:37:57,300 --> 01:37:59,140
Fuck you! And fuck her!

1318
01:37:59,340 --> 01:38:02,940
Go ahead, put me out of my misery.
Pull the fucking trigger.

1319
01:38:04,060 --> 01:38:05,620
Pull the fucking trigger.

1320
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:07,060
Do it!

1321
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:08,860
Do it!

1322
01:38:16,020 --> 01:38:17,580
You can't do it.

1323
01:38:18,420 --> 01:38:20,460
You little pansy bitch!

1324
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:21,820
Look at you...

1325
01:38:22,020 --> 01:38:23,860
...big fucking hero, man.

1326
01:38:24,060 --> 01:38:25,580
You can't fucking do it.

1327
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:28,660
Look at him.

1328
01:38:29,500 --> 01:38:31,020
Big fucking hero.

1329
01:38:32,100 --> 01:38:34,020
Go on home to your wifey!

1330
01:38:35,220 --> 01:38:36,820
You pussy!

1331
01:38:37,460 --> 01:38:39,380
You big fucking pussy!

1332
01:38:41,100 --> 01:38:43,380
What are you going to do now, faggot?

1333
01:38:45,740 --> 01:38:47,820
You can't go to the cops!

1334
01:38:49,140 --> 01:38:53,420
Send me your wife and daughter.
We'll make a film, you faggot!

1335
01:38:56,660 --> 01:38:57,820
Shit.

1336
01:38:58,300 --> 01:38:59,820
You punk-ass!

1337
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:46,580
Mrs. Mathews?

1338
01:39:46,940 --> 01:39:48,620
It's Thomas.

1339
01:39:48,980 --> 01:39:50,620
Thomas Hart.

1340
01:39:50,860 --> 01:39:54,060
I was there a few weeks ago
asking about your daughter.

1341
01:39:54,700 --> 01:39:56,940
Yeah, you found her diary.

1342
01:39:57,140 --> 01:39:58,380
Thank you.

1343
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:01,100
She did leave a note...

1344
01:40:01,460 --> 01:40:05,620
...and her stupid boyfriend
dumped her in California...

1345
01:40:06,060 --> 01:40:07,420
...so I told the FBI.

1346
01:40:08,340 --> 01:40:09,820
Remember when...

1347
01:40:10,740 --> 01:40:13,260
...I asked you if you'd want to know...

1348
01:40:14,420 --> 01:40:15,700
...the truth...

1349
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:18,060
...no matter what?

1350
01:40:19,020 --> 01:40:22,700
Some men, they took her and
they killed her and they buried her.

1351
01:40:23,020 --> 01:40:23,860
No, no.

1352
01:40:24,020 --> 01:40:25,420
I'm sorry.

1353
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:26,580
I'm sorry.

1354
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:29,260
I want to punish them for what they did.

1355
01:40:29,740 --> 01:40:31,620
Why are you saying this?

1356
01:40:31,820 --> 01:40:33,460
I can hurt them.

1357
01:40:34,060 --> 01:40:37,100
Give me your permission
to hurt them, please.

1358
01:40:38,060 --> 01:40:39,980
Tell me how much she meant to you.

1359
01:40:41,020 --> 01:40:43,060
Just tell me that you loved her.

1360
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:44,660
Please tell me that you loved her.

1361
01:40:44,820 --> 01:40:46,100
I love her.

1362
01:40:46,540 --> 01:40:48,340
I love her so much.

1363
01:40:50,780 --> 01:40:52,860
I love her so much.

1364
01:40:59,700 --> 01:41:00,980
Who's that?

1365
01:41:03,780 --> 01:41:04,580
No!

1366
01:41:06,380 --> 01:41:08,180
Die, you motherfucker, die!

1367
01:42:40,060 --> 01:42:41,020
New York Hospital.

1368
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:43,060
Can you connect me to the nurse?

1369
01:42:43,220 --> 01:42:44,180
Emergency.

1370
01:42:44,380 --> 01:42:46,740
It's Lt. Anderson of the 13th precinct.

1371
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:49,900
Have you admitted an adult male
with an abdominal wound...

1372
01:42:50,100 --> 01:42:52,460
...in the last 48 hours?
A stabbing incident.

1373
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:54,100
Abdominal wound?

1374
01:42:54,300 --> 01:42:55,340
No, not one.

1375
01:42:55,540 --> 01:42:56,780
Thank you.

1376
01:42:57,100 --> 01:43:00,500
I'm looking for a stabbing victim.
Male. Maybe six feet.

1377
01:43:00,700 --> 01:43:02,540
Filed a bogus report.

1378
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,700
We had a guy in on Monday, l think.

1379
01:43:05,900 --> 01:43:07,980
lt would be yesterday
or the day before.

1380
01:43:08,180 --> 01:43:08,980
Sorry.

1381
01:43:09,820 --> 01:43:12,500
-Queens County Emergency.
-Hi, Lt. Anderson.

1382
01:43:12,700 --> 01:43:14,460
We had a stabbing incident...

1383
01:43:14,700 --> 01:43:16,820
...and supposed victim gave us
a false name.

1384
01:43:17,020 --> 01:43:18,820
A male with an abdominal wound.

1385
01:43:19,020 --> 01:43:20,980
Hold on. Let me check my records.

1386
01:43:21,180 --> 01:43:23,780
There was a patient treated yesterday.

1387
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:25,900
Star tattoo on his right hand?

1388
01:43:26,260 --> 01:43:27,860
Yes. George Anthony Higgins.

1389
01:43:28,060 --> 01:43:32,380
lnsurance policy is under his
mother's name, Doris Veronica Higgins.

1390
01:43:32,620 --> 01:43:34,740
That's him.
Can you give me an address?

1391
01:43:34,940 --> 01:43:36,620
It's under her address. Douglaston.

1392
01:43:36,820 --> 01:43:37,980
Need a street?

1393
01:44:12,700 --> 01:44:15,500
l really wish you'd go
to church with me tonight.

1394
01:44:20,780 --> 01:44:22,420
l love you, son.

1395
01:44:26,380 --> 01:44:28,700
I'll be home by 10. Bye-bye.

1396
01:49:09,980 --> 01:49:11,980
You know the best part
of killing someone?

1397
01:49:12,340 --> 01:49:14,340
The look on their face.

1398
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:16,020
It's that look...

1399
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:17,740
...not when they're threatened...

1400
01:49:17,940 --> 01:49:19,500
...not when you hurt them...

1401
01:49:19,820 --> 01:49:22,260
...not even when they see the knife.

1402
01:49:22,780 --> 01:49:24,780
It's when they feel the knife go in.

1403
01:49:24,980 --> 01:49:26,140
That's it.

1404
01:49:26,580 --> 01:49:28,140
It's surprise.

1405
01:49:28,340 --> 01:49:30,420
They can't believe
it's really happening.

1406
01:49:30,620 --> 01:49:31,820
She had that look.

1407
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:33,420
The girl...

1408
01:49:33,620 --> 01:49:35,220
...when she knew it wasn't just porno.

1409
01:49:35,420 --> 01:49:36,500
Feel how hard I am?

1410
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:49,500
Take off the mask.

1411
01:50:04,980 --> 01:50:07,020
What did you expect, a monster?

1412
01:50:15,020 --> 01:50:16,660
My name's George.

1413
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:18,700
Probably knew that already.

1414
01:50:21,140 --> 01:50:22,580
Can't get your mind around it?

1415
01:50:23,540 --> 01:50:25,140
I don't have any answers.

1416
01:50:25,500 --> 01:50:28,340
Nothing I say is going
to make you sleep easier at night.

1417
01:50:28,540 --> 01:50:31,340
I wasn't beaten. I wasn't molested.

1418
01:50:31,540 --> 01:50:33,260
Mommy didn't abuse me.

1419
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:36,300
Daddy never raped me.

1420
01:50:36,940 --> 01:50:37,980
I'm only what I am.

1421
01:50:39,380 --> 01:50:41,180
That's all there is to it!

1422
01:50:53,140 --> 01:50:54,420
There's no mystery.

1423
01:50:54,940 --> 01:50:58,220
Things I do, I do them because
I like them.

1424
01:50:59,700 --> 01:51:01,180
Because I want to.

1425
01:51:47,220 --> 01:51:49,460
You've been stabbed? How many times?

1426
01:51:49,620 --> 01:51:51,900
Sir, can you tell me your name?

1427
01:52:41,140 --> 01:52:42,420
Is that you?

1428
01:52:45,940 --> 01:52:47,060
My God.

1429
01:53:04,340 --> 01:53:05,620
Save me.

1430
01:53:10,700 --> 01:53:12,180
Save me.

1431
01:54:25,180 --> 01:54:26,820
Dear Mr. Welles:

1432
01:54:27,020 --> 01:54:28,340
Thank you for writing...

1433
01:54:28,540 --> 01:54:30,620
...and telling me your real name...

1434
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:33,540
...who you really are
and what really happened.

1435
01:54:33,740 --> 01:54:35,980
I'm glad those men are dead.

1436
01:54:36,340 --> 01:54:39,340
But nothing will ever
fill the hole in my heart.

1437
01:54:39,540 --> 01:54:42,420
I will try to use
the money you sent for some good...

1438
01:54:42,620 --> 01:54:44,980
...after I  get some help for myself.

1439
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:47,340
I  hated you
for telling me the truth...

1440
01:54:47,540 --> 01:54:50,980
...but now I  realize you and I 
are probably the only people...

1441
01:54:51,180 --> 01:54:53,580
...that ever really
cared about Mary Anne.

1442
01:54:53,780 --> 01:54:55,340
Yours truly...

1443
01:54:55,700 --> 01:54:57,100
...Janet Mathews.

1444
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


1445
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
