1
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,797
Welcome to Miami.
While in the airport, please
observe Florida laws..

2
00:01:29,046 --> 00:01:33,259
which prohibit smoking in the terminal.
Thank you for not smoking.

3
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:51,625
Your son-in-law dealt with the
dry cleaning franchise during the day.

4
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,378
He saw that woman every night.

5
00:02:56,004 --> 00:03:00,551
The specifics are in my report,
and information about the woman.

6
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,886
It's unpleasant, I know.

7
00:03:04,095 --> 00:03:05,763
Discreet, isn't he?

8
00:03:06,348 --> 00:03:07,975
What an imbecile!

9
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:11,228
I tried to warn my daughter,
but what can you do?

10
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:14,105
I worry about the children.

11
00:03:14,313 --> 00:03:16,607
My invoice is in the envelope,
if that's all.

12
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:20,402
Yes, Mr. Welles. Thank you.

13
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:24,407
- Senator, let me know if I can be
of further assistance to you.
- I'll be in touch.

14
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,485
- Hello?
- You're home.

15
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,239
We're back here.

16
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,075
- How did it go?
- I think very well.

17
00:04:11,534 --> 00:04:14,329
Daddy's home, sweetie.

18
00:04:14,538 --> 00:04:17,248
How's the textbook business?

19
00:04:17,415 --> 00:04:21,794
I got 10,000 words on
the Federal Theater project.

20
00:04:21,877 --> 00:04:25,881
It should be 4000 and the writer
doesn't want to change anything.

21
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:30,259
- How was Miami?
- Fine. Lonesome.

22
00:04:30,469 --> 00:04:34,431
- Couldn't pay me enough to live down there.
- Then why'd you go?

23
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,892
Senator Michaelson
has powerful friends.

24
00:04:43,106 --> 00:04:45,149
Hello, Cinderella.

25
00:04:45,776 --> 00:04:49,529
Did you miss me?
I sure missed you.

26
00:04:49,737 --> 00:04:51,906
Oh, that's my girl.
She missed you.
I missed you.

27
00:04:53,616 --> 00:04:55,911
You been smoking?

28
00:04:56,078 --> 00:04:58,828
Smoking? I'm not smoking.

29
00:04:58,996 --> 00:05:02,667
Come on, honey.

30
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:08,004
Amy, I've been sitting around
in bars following this guy.
Is this the first thing I get?

31
00:05:08,213 --> 00:05:10,925
- You're accusing me?
- I'm not accusing you.

32
00:05:11,465 --> 00:05:14,261
I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been all through that.

33
00:05:15,844 --> 00:05:18,974
- I'll make dinner. Are you hungry?
- You're cooking?

34
00:05:23,395 --> 00:05:26,189
- I missed you.
- I love you.

35
00:05:30,609 --> 00:05:33,320
I don't like it when you leave.

36
00:05:37,408 --> 00:05:39,118
Should I go?

37
00:05:39,326 --> 00:05:41,411
I'm going to do it.

38
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:53,423
Come on.

39
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:56,259
What's all the trouble, Cinderella?

40
00:05:56,843 --> 00:05:58,595
There, there.

41
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:08,730
I love you.

42
00:06:11,565 --> 00:06:13,651
I love you.

43
00:06:25,953 --> 00:06:28,122
Honey, phone!

44
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:38,049
Okay, I've got it!

45
00:06:38,215 --> 00:06:40,676
Sorry, I was just switching phones.

46
00:06:44,512 --> 00:06:48,976
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Longdale.
How can I be of assistance to you?

47
00:06:54,356 --> 00:06:56,525
Four o'clock would be fine.

48
00:06:58,277 --> 00:07:01,655
I think I know where it is.

49
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,282
Goodbye.

50
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:44,612
Daniel Longdale.
We spoke on the phone.

51
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:49,409
I'm the Christians' attorney and
an executor of the estate.
This is Mrs. Christian.

52
00:07:49,658 --> 00:07:53,912
- An honor to meet you.
- You come highly
recommended, Mr. Welles.

53
00:07:54,122 --> 00:07:57,915
I've spoken to associates of mine in
Harrisburg, Lancaster and Hershey.

54
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,504
- You have influential friends.
- I've been privileged to provide
services for people I admire.

55
00:08:02,628 --> 00:08:05,382
You were praised for your discretion..

56
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:09,469
your strict adherence
to confidentiality.

57
00:08:12,848 --> 00:08:17,977
- As you know, my husband passed away recently.
- My condolences, Mrs. Christian.

58
00:08:18,102 --> 00:08:23,482
His passing has left me
with something of a dilemma.

59
00:08:23,649 --> 00:08:26,527
I'll do whatever I can to help.

60
00:08:26,693 --> 00:08:31,574
- My husband's inner sanctum.
- Not many people have been inside this room.

61
00:08:34,034 --> 00:08:37,913
- My father worked the Pittsburgh mill.
- Irving United Steel, I believe.

62
00:08:38,121 --> 00:08:41,750
But you attended Penn
on an academic scholarship.

63
00:08:41,957 --> 00:08:46,503
- Peers went into law and finance.
You chose surveillance.
- I decided it was the future.

64
00:08:47,004 --> 00:08:49,715
- Your husband is a legend.
- Please.

65
00:08:49,882 --> 00:08:53,385
We were married for 45 years.
Four children..

66
00:08:53,552 --> 00:08:55,846
Seven grandchildren.

67
00:08:56,013 --> 00:08:59,225
But his true passion lay..
..in his work.

68
00:08:59,391 --> 00:09:04,146
But he was always loyal.
I loved him deeply.

69
00:09:04,313 --> 00:09:06,064
I understand.

70
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,194
Daniel.

71
00:09:10,444 --> 00:09:13,738
My husband was the only one
with the combination to this safe.

72
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:16,366
We hired somebody to open it.

73
00:09:16,574 --> 00:09:20,203
I have not let anyone see the contents.

74
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:23,373
I felt these were
my husband's private things.

75
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,542
I didn't..

76
00:09:26,584 --> 00:09:28,503
I didn't realize..

77
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,548
Do you want to Teri me
what you found?

78
00:09:34,132 --> 00:09:37,302
Cash, stock certificates..

79
00:09:37,469 --> 00:09:40,264
Nothing out of the ordinary,
reality, except that.

80
00:09:41,850 --> 00:09:44,476
It's a film..

81
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:49,231
- ..where a girl appears to be murdered.
- I'm not sure I understand.

82
00:09:49,398 --> 00:09:51,775
It is very realistic.

83
00:09:51,983 --> 00:09:56,320
But how many people seem to be realistically killed..
..in movies and on TV every day?

84
00:09:57,280 --> 00:10:00,409
It begins as a relatively
sleazy bit of pornography..

85
00:10:00,576 --> 00:10:03,953
and rapidly turns
quite violent and bloody.

86
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:11,376
What you're talking about
is called a snuff film.

87
00:10:11,544 --> 00:10:15,839
Snuff films are a kind of urban myth.
Sex industry folklore.

88
00:10:16,047 --> 00:10:19,217
- There's no such thing.
- That's what I explained to Mrs. Christian.

89
00:10:19,384 --> 00:10:24,222
This is probably an S & M film of some sort.
Simulated rape, simulated violence.

90
00:10:24,431 --> 00:10:28,100
It's hard to stomach,
but there are ways of doing it.
Fake blood, special effects.

91
00:10:28,267 --> 00:10:31,979
Would you look at the film
and give us your opinion?

92
00:10:32,147 --> 00:10:34,274
All I want..

93
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:37,194
is to know that
this atrocity is false.

94
00:10:38,152 --> 00:10:39,737
I want the proof.

95
00:12:30,384 --> 00:12:35,181
Well.. whoever made the film
was adept at authenticity.
But I'm no expert.

96
00:12:35,388 --> 00:12:39,059
- Let the police make a determination.
- Out of the question.

97
00:12:39,267 --> 00:12:42,229
That'd be so unnecessary
for any number of reasons..

98
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:45,316
not the least of which is
Mr. Christian's reputation.

99
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:50,612
Find out who made this film..
..and establish whether it's real.

100
00:12:51,153 --> 00:12:56,117
You can name your price.. you'll be
provided with whatever you need to buy
information.

101
00:12:58,535 --> 00:13:03,415
Girl's all I've got to go on. I could
treat it like a missing persons case.

102
00:13:03,582 --> 00:13:08,378
We need to be assured that
you would not copy this film.

103
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:10,588
You have my word on that.

104
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:15,636
But I'll be dealing directly with you.. and only you.
Your relationship with your attorney is your own.

105
00:13:15,844 --> 00:13:18,055
- No offense.
- None taken.

106
00:13:18,262 --> 00:13:21,807
I realize you've given this
careful consideration.

107
00:13:22,808 --> 00:13:26,687
- You could have destroyed it.
- Tell me the poor girl wasn't killed.

108
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:30,398
Please?..Find her alive.

109
00:13:30,607 --> 00:13:33,236
I'll do the best I can, ma'am.

110
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,651
- Cleveland? You just got home.
- I wish I could stay,

111
00:14:15,818 --> 00:14:18,778
but this is the mortgage.
It's Cindy's college money.

112
00:14:18,988 --> 00:14:22,615
If I do right by her,
with the circle she runs in..
..this could be a big break.

113
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:26,411
- Do we need a break?
- Your father thinks we do.

114
00:14:29,122 --> 00:14:32,167
So, what was Mrs. Christian like?

115
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:35,503
Like you'd expect, I guess.
I feel sorry for her.

116
00:14:35,712 --> 00:14:39,591
It's a missing persons.
I told her I'd give it
a couple of weeks. Three.

117
00:14:40,425 --> 00:14:43,303
It can't take longer than that.
It's an outside shot.

118
00:14:43,469 --> 00:14:45,846
That's all I can Teri you.

119
00:14:46,013 --> 00:14:47,849
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.

120
00:14:48,015 --> 00:14:50,184
It's always that way.

121
00:14:51,226 --> 00:14:54,229
- She's awake. I'll get her.
- I'll be up in a sec.

122
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:24,091
- You're taking the gun?
- I won't need it.

123
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,969
- Don't take it.
- I won't wear it. It's a precaution. Don't worry.

124
00:15:28,178 --> 00:15:30,305
Will you call me
when you get there, please?

125
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:49,907
I've been hired by a couple in
Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.

126
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:53,285
A few days ago, they picked up
a girl hitchhiking off 81..

127
00:15:53,409 --> 00:15:56,913
a runaway, about 18, maybe.
They buy her a meal.

128
00:15:57,121 --> 00:16:01,668
The doctor tries to convince her..
..that, at least, she should call home.

129
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:06,047
Not surprisingly, the girl ate,
excused herself.. that was
the last they saw of her.

130
00:16:06,214 --> 00:16:11,426
We had a friend of mine at the department
work up a sketch. They want to see if
I can I.D. this girl..

131
00:16:11,636 --> 00:16:16,014
then pass along a message to the parents..
..letting them know the kid's alive.

132
00:16:17,308 --> 00:16:20,394
- You don't mind if I run a check?
- Go ahead.

133
00:16:21,436 --> 00:16:23,856
You want it, you got it.
Knock yourself out.

134
00:16:24,064 --> 00:16:27,317
Anywhere from 850,000 to 1,000,000
missing every year.

135
00:16:27,484 --> 00:16:30,613
We got as much as we can on computer,
then it's the wet-thumb method.

136
00:16:30,822 --> 00:16:34,407
Files are by state and year of disappearance.
Children are separate.

137
00:16:34,616 --> 00:16:39,204
No eating or smoking.
- There's coffee.
- Any good?

138
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:43,833
It'll be your best friend after a few days
if you last that long. Good luck!

139
00:16:47,795 --> 00:16:49,421
Honey, it's me.

140
00:16:49,589 --> 00:16:51,756
- How are you?
- I'm good.

141
00:16:51,923 --> 00:16:54,594
- Where are you?
- I'm still in Cleveland.

142
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:58,763
- How's Cindy?
- She's sweet. She's sleeping.

143
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,434
- I'm missing you bigtime.
- Yeah, I miss you too.

144
00:17:04,603 --> 00:17:08,480
- I'll call you tomorrow night. Good night.
- Good night, sweetheart.

145
00:17:51,355 --> 00:17:54,734
Hello, Mrs. Christian? Tom Welles.
Here's where we stand.

146
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:58,321
I checked the film stock.
It's called Supralux 5-4-4.

147
00:17:58,487 --> 00:18:01,783
The company that made that
stock discontinued it in '92.

148
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:05,202
- So the film was made prior to that?
- Yes.

149
00:18:05,410 --> 00:18:07,664
I'm probably being
overly thorough with this..

150
00:18:07,913 --> 00:18:12,459
but you might dig up your husband's
financial records.. about 6 or 7 years ago.

151
00:18:12,668 --> 00:18:15,044
See if there's anything
out of the ordinary.

152
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:18,757
This isn't a movie you drop off
at the one-hour photo.

153
00:18:18,924 --> 00:18:24,303
- So you think it's one of a kind.
- The film is what we've got.
There's no negative.

154
00:18:25,013 --> 00:18:27,598
Unlike video, it's not
designed to be duplicated.

155
00:18:27,765 --> 00:18:32,895
Whatever this is, I have a feeling..
..there aren't many copies
floating around, if any.

156
00:18:33,104 --> 00:18:36,649
I'm looking for a girl
we're not even sure is missing.

157
00:18:36,858 --> 00:18:39,402
With this happening 6 or 7 years ago..

158
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,739
finding the guys who made this film
is going to be very difficult.

159
00:18:43,948 --> 00:18:46,993
I know you can do it.
You're doing a wonderful job.

160
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,162
Please tell me you'll
continue the investigation.

161
00:18:50,371 --> 00:18:52,122
I will. I'll keep trying for you.

162
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,333
You can count on me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.

163
00:18:56,418 --> 00:19:00,546
We can't come to the phone now,
so please leave a message at the beep.

164
00:19:00,713 --> 00:19:06,219
Honey, it's me. I'm sorry I forgot to
call last night.. I won't forget tonight.

165
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:09,513
I've been gone a long time.
I hope I'll be home soon.

166
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,391
I love you, and I miss you.
We'll talk tonight.

167
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:49,384
Mary Anne Mathews
AGE: 16

168
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:52,304
MISSING SINCE 1993

169
00:20:29,672 --> 00:20:31,216
Hello!

170
00:20:31,466 --> 00:20:33,760
Looking for Janet?

171
00:20:39,558 --> 00:20:44,312
Hello, Mrs. Mathews?
I'm Thomas Hart.
I'm a licensed investigator.

172
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:49,526
I've been hired by the U.S.
Resource Center, Missing Persons..
as part of an internal audit.

173
00:20:49,734 --> 00:20:54,947
I'd like you to answer questions
about your daughter, Mary Anne.

174
00:20:55,072 --> 00:20:59,033
I spoke to your FBI contact
yesterday, Agent..

175
00:20:59,243 --> 00:21:01,829
- Neil. Neil Cole?
- Yes, Agent Cole.

176
00:21:01,954 --> 00:21:07,333
- He told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.
- He didn't call?

177
00:21:13,590 --> 00:21:16,218
- Is this you?
- Yes.

178
00:21:16,384 --> 00:21:19,636
- You look about five years old.
- A little older.

179
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:21,639
Sweet.

180
00:21:23,975 --> 00:21:29,189
It's important that you don't
let this raise your expectations.

181
00:21:29,271 --> 00:21:33,025
It's not going to effect
any ongoing efforts.

182
00:21:33,192 --> 00:21:37,946
All I'm saying is, please know..
..I'm not here to create any false hope.

183
00:21:41,658 --> 00:21:46,078
We fought all the time, Mary Anne and me..
..and her stepdad.

184
00:21:46,288 --> 00:21:50,625
She hated him..
..because he was not her real dad.

185
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,669
Trouble here, trouble at school..

186
00:21:53,836 --> 00:21:55,253
Trouble.

187
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:58,966
Didn't like rules.
Takes after me, I guess.

188
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:01,885
I had to learn the hard way.

189
00:22:02,929 --> 00:22:05,807
Can I speak to your husband?

190
00:22:06,015 --> 00:22:08,099
Her stepfather? Dave? Gone.

191
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:11,353
Two years after Mary Anne left.

192
00:22:11,562 --> 00:22:14,439
All the time, she resented him.

193
00:22:14,648 --> 00:22:18,610
I lost her because of him,
and then I lost him.

194
00:22:18,819 --> 00:22:21,363
I'm the only one still here.

195
00:22:22,363 --> 00:22:26,952
- Did Mary have a boyfriend?
- She was sneaking out with someone.

196
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:29,287
She wouldn't Teri me who.

197
00:22:29,496 --> 00:22:32,707
Coming home with hickeys,
lying all the time.

198
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:37,419
I am sorry to bring this up,
but in these circumstances..

199
00:22:37,628 --> 00:22:41,632
with the stepfather..
..were there any indications
of any sort of abuse?

200
00:22:41,841 --> 00:22:43,716
There was nothing like that.

201
00:22:43,883 --> 00:22:48,680
The police and FBI asked. There wasn't
anything like that. She'd have told me.

202
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,891
I apologize. I had to ask.

203
00:22:52,976 --> 00:22:57,147
Those are for her birthday.
One for every year she missed.

204
00:22:57,355 --> 00:23:00,440
They'll be waiting for her
when she comes back.

205
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:06,363
It's because I slapped her.
I know.

206
00:23:08,198 --> 00:23:10,993
We were fighting about Dave..

207
00:23:11,160 --> 00:23:14,663
and she was just pushing my buttons.
And I slapped her.

208
00:23:15,706 --> 00:23:19,418
Jesus!
Next day, she was gone.

209
00:23:20,752 --> 00:23:23,630
When kids run, they almost always
leave a note.

210
00:23:23,839 --> 00:23:28,134
- It's guilt, usually.
- There wasn't one.Police looked.

211
00:23:28,301 --> 00:23:33,723
An abduction's one thing, a runaway's
another. Sometimes it's not the priority
for the police it should be.

212
00:23:34,432 --> 00:23:38,478
There wasn't anything.
Don't you think I wish there was?

213
00:23:38,644 --> 00:23:41,022
You're probably right,
but would you let me look?

214
00:23:42,939 --> 00:23:46,110
You Teri me.. not to get my hopes up..

215
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:50,072
not to raise my expectations.

216
00:23:54,075 --> 00:23:57,037
Go ahead. I need a drink.

217
00:23:58,413 --> 00:24:00,040
Thank you.

218
00:25:43,763 --> 00:25:48,601
Dear Mom, if you're reading this, it means
I called you from Hollywood, California.

219
00:25:48,810 --> 00:25:54,399
I left my diary behind because
I want you to see why I'm leaving.
It's not because you hit me.

220
00:25:54,607 --> 00:25:57,651
I hid this so Dave the dickhead
wouldn't find it.

221
00:25:57,818 --> 00:26:02,406
Warren Anderson and me are in love.
I'm going to start a new life with him.

222
00:26:02,615 --> 00:26:07,285
His dad owns that garage in town.
But Warren has even bigger plans.

223
00:26:07,452 --> 00:26:09,663
He'll become a star in action movies.

224
00:26:09,872 --> 00:26:13,833
He says I'm prettier
than a lot of girls in movies.
I could be a star too.

225
00:26:14,042 --> 00:26:16,170
You want a drink?

226
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:21,965
When we cruise into Hollywood..
..I'll have fiery eyes that everyone
will notice, because I am in love.

227
00:26:24,552 --> 00:26:27,513
You were right.
I didn't find anything.

228
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:31,851
- Fixed you a drink.
- Thanks, no. I've got work to do.

229
00:26:32,018 --> 00:26:34,602
I'll stop by tomorrow night.

230
00:26:34,728 --> 00:26:37,314
We'll probably be married
by the time you read this.

231
00:26:38,398 --> 00:26:40,901
Don't come looking for me,
because I'm not coming back.

232
00:26:41,067 --> 00:26:44,696
Maybe someday you'll see me
on TV or in magazines.

233
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:47,574
Don't worry about me.
Love, Mary Anne.

234
00:26:48,282 --> 00:26:49,743
Mr. Anderson?

235
00:26:49,910 --> 00:26:52,621
Who's asking?

236
00:26:52,829 --> 00:26:55,706
Tom Hart.
Excuse me not shaking hands.

237
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:59,794
I'm looking for your son.
You've got a son named Warren, right?

238
00:27:00,002 --> 00:27:02,004
Sure.

239
00:27:02,213 --> 00:27:04,423
What's it about? You a cop?

240
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:09,302
No, sir. Just a friend from a while back.
Owe him some money.

241
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,098
You owe him money? That's a new one.

242
00:27:15,183 --> 00:27:17,644
You can leave it
right here if you want.

243
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:22,732
If it's all the same,
I'd like to send it to him.
California, right?

244
00:27:24,526 --> 00:27:26,486
California?

245
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,615
Son, you know where
the Fayetteville lockup is?

246
00:27:30,823 --> 00:27:35,034
That's where Warren is.
Doing eight months on a B and E.

247
00:27:38,581 --> 00:27:40,332
Thank you.

248
00:27:42,625 --> 00:27:48,215
Yeah, man, I knew her. Dumped that bitch
right before I moved to L.A.

249
00:27:49,175 --> 00:27:51,844
She shows up knocking at my door
like a fucking stalker.

250
00:27:52,343 --> 00:27:55,472
Told that bitch she could go to hell.

251
00:27:56,681 --> 00:27:58,850
Where'd she go?

252
00:27:59,726 --> 00:28:01,894
Hell, maybe..

253
00:28:02,103 --> 00:28:04,771
I don't know and
I don't give a fuck, either.

254
00:28:06,232 --> 00:28:09,526
She said she might work
at a titty bar or something.

255
00:28:09,693 --> 00:28:12,113
Ask me, her tits
weren't all that great.

256
00:28:13,781 --> 00:28:16,241
Did you hear from her again?

257
00:28:17,576 --> 00:28:20,746
Because I fucked her
doesn't mean I wanted her there.

258
00:28:20,953 --> 00:28:24,500
She came to Hollywood to be
a big fucking movie star.

259
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,127
And so did I.
Check me out now.

260
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:34,009
Why don't you pass me
one of them smokes?

261
00:28:40,807 --> 00:28:43,142
I don't smoke.

262
00:28:46,604 --> 00:28:48,689
- How you doing?
- I'm okay.

263
00:28:48,898 --> 00:28:52,777
- You don't sound okay.
- It's not easy.

264
00:28:52,985 --> 00:28:57,113
- Why? What's going on?
- It's just tougher than
I thought it would be.

265
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:00,325
- Is it getting to you?
- I got a lead I can't drop.

266
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:04,496
- I'm almost done. I miss you.
- I miss you too. I love you.

267
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:08,207
- Give Cindy a kiss for me.
- Wait, I think she wants to say bye.

268
00:29:08,374 --> 00:29:12,129
- Say bye to Daddy.
- Hi, sweetie. Hi, honey.

269
00:29:12,712 --> 00:29:16,132
- Hi, Cinderella.
- She's touching the phone.

270
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:19,385
You should see her face
at your voice.

271
00:29:20,052 --> 00:29:23,347
- I love you.
- I love you. Bye.

272
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,102
I was just making dinner.

273
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:33,231
- I've made enough for two, as it happens.
- I'm sorry, I can't stay.

274
00:29:33,439 --> 00:29:36,860
I wanted to let you know
I spoke to my people at the agency.

275
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:40,112
I told them to keep
Mary Anne's case active.

276
00:29:43,366 --> 00:29:46,327
Well.. stay for a drink, at least.

277
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:54,543
You sure you're not hungry?
It'd be nice to have a meal
without the TV on for once.

278
00:29:55,544 --> 00:29:59,882
- I have a long drive ahead of me.
- It's one of the most
depressing things. Eating alone.

279
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:03,552
I don't know why. You think
I'd be used to it by now.

280
00:30:14,271 --> 00:30:16,272
Mrs. Mathews?

281
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:20,194
- Janet.
- Do you ever consider..

282
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,362
Do you realize that Mary Anne
may never come back?

283
00:30:25,157 --> 00:30:27,699
I think about it every day.

284
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,580
Every time the phone rings..
..every time, I still think it's her.

285
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:36,125
She's all I think about.

286
00:30:37,209 --> 00:30:39,462
Can you Teri me..

287
00:30:39,670 --> 00:30:43,089
if you had to make a choice,
if you were forced to choose..

288
00:30:43,673 --> 00:30:47,010
between imagining her
out there somewhere..

289
00:30:47,219 --> 00:30:50,180
living a good life, being happy..

290
00:30:51,597 --> 00:30:55,352
but you don't know..
..you never find out..

291
00:30:57,102 --> 00:30:59,563
or the worst being true..

292
00:30:59,772 --> 00:31:02,274
her being gone..

293
00:31:02,482 --> 00:31:04,777
but you know.

294
00:31:04,986 --> 00:31:07,863
You finally know..

295
00:31:08,072 --> 00:31:09,657
what's happened to her.

296
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:13,159
What would I choose?

297
00:31:18,998 --> 00:31:21,334
Yes. I would choose to know.

298
00:31:23,461 --> 00:31:26,256
I need to know.

299
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:34,556
Excuse me, I have to use your restroom.

300
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,982
You're leaving.

301
00:32:29,191 --> 00:32:30,650
I'll call you if I find anything out.

302
00:32:32,903 --> 00:32:35,280
I'll call you if I learn something.

303
00:35:11,678 --> 00:35:13,722
How you doing?

304
00:35:13,931 --> 00:35:17,558
- Big date tonight?
- Yeah, guess so.

305
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:20,812
Could I interest you
in a battery-operated vagina?

306
00:35:21,021 --> 00:35:23,899
It is tempting, but no thanks.

307
00:35:24,107 --> 00:35:29,362
I'd hate to see you in one of those
everyday situations that calls for it
and you don't have one.

308
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:31,906
I'll risk it.

309
00:35:32,615 --> 00:35:35,450
All right, your total
is $74.58, please.

310
00:35:38,913 --> 00:35:40,748
A hundred.

311
00:35:45,377 --> 00:35:48,506
Total's $25 and some change.

312
00:35:52,175 --> 00:35:57,596
Thank you for shopping at Adult Bookstore.
And have yourself a fabulous day.

313
00:35:57,763 --> 00:36:00,350
What are you reading?

314
00:36:01,685 --> 00:36:06,440
Catchy title. What are you reality
reading? Hard to believe it's got
any parts worth highlighting.

315
00:36:09,775 --> 00:36:11,526
Capote.

316
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,489
- You know how it is.
- Sure.

317
00:36:15,698 --> 00:36:20,411
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
in front of your fellow perverts.

318
00:36:20,619 --> 00:36:25,582
I might get drummed out
of the pornographers' union.
Where would I be then?

319
00:36:27,167 --> 00:36:28,711
Have a good day.

320
00:36:55,736 --> 00:36:58,363
- How are you?
- Hey, honey.

321
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,449
- How you doing?
- I'm a little beat.

322
00:37:00,656 --> 00:37:03,201
- How's Cindy?
- She's sweet. She misses you.

323
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:08,790
- How's it going?
- The way things are going,
I'm thinking about coming home.

324
00:37:09,207 --> 00:37:11,584
Really?

325
00:37:11,751 --> 00:37:13,085
Honey, wait.

326
00:37:16,255 --> 00:37:19,258
- Can I call you back?
- I'll call you right back, I promise.
Bye, honey.

327
00:38:01,506 --> 00:38:06,136
Mrs. Christian, there were three men.
Not just the cameraman and the masked man.

328
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:10,432
I caught a glimpse of a third man.
He was watching.

329
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:13,309
I'll get a clearer image
through computer enhancement.

330
00:38:13,518 --> 00:38:16,646
But this probably happened
6 years ago, so it's not..

331
00:38:16,855 --> 00:38:21,483
All right, I'll keep trying. Thank you,
I appreciate your support. Goodbye.

332
00:38:22,693 --> 00:38:25,780
What we have here is
137 billable man-hours..

333
00:38:25,946 --> 00:38:28,406
a hundred-plus thousand
dollars machine..

334
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:33,455
and the result is an enhancement
of the back of some guy's head.

335
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:37,624
Want it framed?

336
00:38:41,753 --> 00:38:45,673
It's like a gas station,
you pay before you pump.

337
00:38:45,798 --> 00:38:48,469
Remember me?

338
00:38:48,634 --> 00:38:51,888
Came back for the battery-operated
vagina after all.

339
00:38:53,222 --> 00:38:58,143
- I need information. Maybe you can help.
- Thomas Welles. Nice picture.

340
00:38:59,061 --> 00:39:03,441
- What sort of information? I got all different kinds.
- The kind I'll pay for.

341
00:39:04,524 --> 00:39:09,071
I don't know what you're looking for..
..so we're clear from the start,
I'm straight.

342
00:39:09,279 --> 00:39:12,908
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.. Zip it!

343
00:39:13,117 --> 00:39:15,994
I can hook you up.
Name the vice,
I name the price.

344
00:39:16,203 --> 00:39:19,998
- How long you been working here?
- Almost two years.

345
00:39:20,207 --> 00:39:23,793
- What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?
- Max.

346
00:39:25,211 --> 00:39:29,173
This thing has to do
with underground pornography.

347
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:34,261
- Stuff that's sold under the counter, illegally.
- There is not much illegal out there.

348
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:37,932
Whatever there is, I want to know.
I want a good look.

349
00:39:38,099 --> 00:39:42,061
If you've got that kind of
connection, great. If not, speak now.

350
00:39:42,269 --> 00:39:46,022
You're not a cop, are you?
If I ask and you are,
you got to Teri me.

351
00:39:46,231 --> 00:39:48,025
I'm not a cop.

352
00:39:48,234 --> 00:39:51,195
A private detective? Like Shaft?

353
00:39:52,195 --> 00:39:54,739
You ever seen Private Dicks?
I got it on sale.

354
00:39:54,906 --> 00:39:58,952
- How much you make in there?
- I do not know..

355
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,913
Around 400 bucks a week,
off the books.

356
00:40:02,122 --> 00:40:06,918
Let's pretend I live in the same fantasy world..
..where you make $400 a week in that dump..

357
00:40:07,127 --> 00:40:10,712
- I'll give you 500 for a few days.
- Six sounds good, Pops.

358
00:40:10,921 --> 00:40:12,549
Five.

359
00:40:13,508 --> 00:40:15,884
Here's my number.

360
00:40:19,178 --> 00:40:23,642
- When can you start?
- Well, tomorrow night I get off late.

361
00:40:24,852 --> 00:40:26,854
- Tomorrow, then.
- All right.

362
00:40:27,019 --> 00:40:29,605
And don't call me Pops.

363
00:40:30,440 --> 00:40:33,734
Of course not. I wouldn't
want to hurt your feelings.

364
00:40:35,862 --> 00:40:39,657
I don't know what your scene is.
you may like porn as much as the next guy.

365
00:40:39,906 --> 00:40:43,453
You don't look like your average
sleaze. More like your average cop.

366
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:47,748
So when you ask people
about fucking illegal stuff..

367
00:40:47,956 --> 00:40:50,334
- ..it has a certain patina to it.
- Patina?

368
00:40:50,501 --> 00:40:52,461
It's a Truman Capote word. Hello?

369
00:40:52,669 --> 00:40:56,131
If someone never sold a snuff film,
they shouldn't care what I ask.

370
00:40:56,339 --> 00:41:01,219
If they have, they should be nervous.
Whoever acts insulted, knock on their door.

371
00:41:01,428 --> 00:41:05,182
Look, Pops, it's not too late
to change your mind about all this.

372
00:41:05,389 --> 00:41:09,852
There's things you'll see
that you can't unsee.
make the unseen. They stay in your head.

373
00:41:09,977 --> 00:41:14,856
- How do you know what I've seen?
- Okay, fine.
But everybody's got their limit.

374
00:41:15,065 --> 00:41:18,528
I've been here six fucking years
trying to get my music together.

375
00:41:18,694 --> 00:41:22,072
So I start part-time
where I work, to make ends meet.

376
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,618
And boom, a couple years go by,
and here I am.

377
00:41:25,825 --> 00:41:29,413
I'm just saying, before you know it,
you're in it. Deep in it.

378
00:41:29,580 --> 00:41:32,373
Do not worry about me. But thanks anyway.

379
00:41:32,541 --> 00:41:34,334
You're welcome.

380
00:41:34,543 --> 00:41:39,923
Pops, you dance with the devil,
the devil don't change. Devil changes you.

381
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,966
- Some of your lyrics?
- That's cute.

382
00:41:53,228 --> 00:41:57,439
This place has been around about 3 years,
but they keep moving it house to house.

383
00:41:57,606 --> 00:42:01,026
Good evening, ladies.
How are you?

384
00:42:01,236 --> 00:42:03,695
Hey, kid!

385
00:42:03,904 --> 00:42:07,491
I got something for you here. Come on ..!

386
00:42:13,538 --> 00:42:17,125
This is the tip of the iceberg.
Mexican S & M..

387
00:42:17,291 --> 00:42:21,921
Asian bondage, djursex,
if you're into that.

388
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:24,924
- Don't touch nothing.
You want something, tell Friendly.
- Ask him.

389
00:42:27,176 --> 00:42:29,469
Don't do that!

390
00:42:30,345 --> 00:42:33,141
- What?
- Snuff movies.

391
00:42:36,935 --> 00:42:38,770
Come on!

392
00:42:38,936 --> 00:42:41,523
All right! It's cool!

393
00:42:43,191 --> 00:42:47,070
- I have money! Jack!
- Gimme! Fast as hell!

394
00:42:48,446 --> 00:42:50,407
Gimme!

395
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:55,661
Come on, let's go. All right!

396
00:42:56,453 --> 00:43:00,833
- Are you affiliated with law enforcement?
- Fuck you, Larry.

397
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,087
Are you a law enforcement agent,
or affiliated with law enforcement?

398
00:43:05,212 --> 00:43:08,382
- Fuck you, Larry.
- You're getting cool there, Welles.

399
00:43:08,591 --> 00:43:12,177
You got your porn zombies here.
Junkies for the hard stuff.

400
00:43:12,385 --> 00:43:16,848
But these sales won't last much longer.
It's risky, and everything's on the Net.

401
00:43:17,055 --> 00:43:19,434
Chicken hawks swapping photos
with their modems.

402
00:43:19,642 --> 00:43:25,356
Then there's classified ads
with hidden codes, secret couriers..
..wires through dummy corporations.

403
00:43:25,565 --> 00:43:28,443
If something's illegal, the buyers
are as far away as they can get.

404
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:31,696
Nobody knows what nobody knows,
you know what I mean?

405
00:43:31,904 --> 00:43:32,988
- How's it going, Samuel?
- I'll say hi to her.

406
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:40,496
How are you? I love that.

407
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:44,583
It's the Michael Jackson look,
with the zippers.

408
00:43:52,548 --> 00:43:54,510
CHILDREN

409
00:44:15,153 --> 00:44:17,239
What are these?

410
00:44:17,406 --> 00:44:19,408
Extreme bondage.

411
00:44:19,616 --> 00:44:21,827
Rape films.

412
00:44:22,034 --> 00:44:26,164
Sick shit. Buy five, get one for free.

413
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:31,836
- Anything harder?
- There is nothing harder.

414
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:34,923
Snuff?

415
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:41,430
There's no such thing as snuff.
What you see is what I got, mister.

416
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,808
- Do you know where I can get some?
- Fuck off.

417
00:45:31,934 --> 00:45:36,314
There she is.
It's Double Slap Dorothy.

418
00:45:36,481 --> 00:45:40,401
That chick could be
a baseball player.
The swing on her is unreal.

419
00:45:41,694 --> 00:45:45,323
Some of these S & M and bondage films
you'll see straddle the line.

420
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:49,535
Foot fetish, orgies, shit films..
..hermaphrodites, mutilation.
It's harder than hard-core.

421
00:45:49,702 --> 00:45:52,329
- But mostly it is legal.
- Stick.

422
00:45:52,537 --> 00:45:56,666
One guy sees it and pukes.
Another guy sees it and fall in love.

423
00:45:57,626 --> 00:46:01,755
This is the guy I told you about.
Got the tapes?

424
00:46:01,922 --> 00:46:03,840
- $1000.
- 1200 for the two.

425
00:46:04,007 --> 00:46:06,593
- You told Max 1000.
- I know. This is more fun.

426
00:46:06,802 --> 00:46:10,721
I raise the price, you get pissed off.
Take it or leave it.

427
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:14,725
- I thought we had a relationship.
- Is it real?
- Sickest shit you'll ever see.

428
00:46:19,773 --> 00:46:24,026
Is that real?
That sure as shit looks real.

429
00:46:30,991 --> 00:46:33,160
She's not breathing.

430
00:46:41,877 --> 00:46:45,131
- Who makes these films?
- I don't know.

431
00:46:45,338 --> 00:46:47,507
Looks like the Philippines.

432
00:46:52,011 --> 00:46:54,471
Yeah, definitely the Philippines.

433
00:47:16,576 --> 00:47:19,120
Wait a minute.
That's the same girl.

434
00:47:19,287 --> 00:47:21,873
Isn't that the same girl? Look!

435
00:47:23,583 --> 00:47:26,544
- It's the same..
- They're fakes.

436
00:47:28,378 --> 00:47:31,007
That's great.

437
00:47:31,757 --> 00:47:34,927
"Snuff 2: The Resurrection."

438
00:47:35,135 --> 00:47:39,181
Oh, boy.
Well, what do you expect for 1200?

439
00:47:41,808 --> 00:47:45,062
You want a beer or something?
I could use anything.

440
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:48,940
But I'm sorry, man.
I told you snuff was bogus.

441
00:47:49,107 --> 00:47:52,235
I just wish I would have
gotten you a receipt.

442
00:47:52,401 --> 00:47:55,738
"Hard Spank. Max California."

443
00:47:56,448 --> 00:47:59,408
That's my old band. We broke up.

444
00:47:59,576 --> 00:48:02,453
- When?
- Maybe about a year ago.

445
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:09,335
I don't mean any offense..
..but what are you doing
mixed up in all this?

446
00:48:09,835 --> 00:48:12,463
I'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.

447
00:48:12,671 --> 00:48:16,092
You strike me as being smart enough
to do something else.

448
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,594
Thank you. I wish you owned
a record label.

449
00:48:20,804 --> 00:48:23,598
Look, it beats pumping gas.

450
00:48:23,807 --> 00:48:28,104
I don't buy it. I don't endorse it.
I just point the way.

451
00:48:29,478 --> 00:48:32,689
- You said it gets to you.
- Well, hell, yeah.

452
00:48:32,899 --> 00:48:36,944
Parade of losers I see every day?
What choices have I got?

453
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:41,949
The music industry is not exactly
beating down my door.

454
00:48:42,116 --> 00:48:45,244
And what about you, Tom Welles?

455
00:48:45,411 --> 00:48:48,706
You got a ring on your finger.
You got kids?

456
00:48:48,914 --> 00:48:51,124
A daughter.

457
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,878
So you got a wife and a daughter..
and a nice little yellow house..

458
00:48:56,087 --> 00:48:58,339
and a dog named Shep.

459
00:48:58,548 --> 00:49:01,259
What the hell are you doing here?

460
00:49:03,636 --> 00:49:05,638
Good question.

461
00:49:07,724 --> 00:49:11,227
Do you get turned on
at places like tonight?

462
00:49:11,394 --> 00:49:14,981
- No, I am not.
- You don't exactly get turned off, either.

463
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,070
- Devil's changing you already.
- Good night, Max.

464
00:49:58,438 --> 00:50:02,484
This gentleman was asking if anyone
recognizes this girl.

465
00:50:04,194 --> 00:50:06,988
Yes.. enough, I remember Mary.

466
00:50:07,155 --> 00:50:09,324
Mary Anne Mathews?

467
00:50:09,949 --> 00:50:13,912
She lived here for only about a month,
if I recall correctly.

468
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,456
She didn't return one night.
Do you know what happened to her?

469
00:50:16,663 --> 00:50:20,918
- Not yet, but I'm looking
into it for her parents.

470
00:50:21,085 --> 00:50:25,672
Could you get that flowered one down for me?
That's her suitcase.

471
00:50:25,881 --> 00:50:29,675
I'd forgotten about it
till you showed me her picture.

472
00:50:29,884 --> 00:50:35,474
I suppose I always hoped she'd be back.
She seemed so lost.

473
00:50:35,682 --> 00:50:39,310
After a time, all I could do was pray
she'd moved on to better things.

474
00:50:39,519 --> 00:50:44,356
- Can you get this suitcase
to her people? If it's appropriate.
- Yes, of course. Thank you.

475
00:51:27,982 --> 00:51:31,776
Starlight, star bright
First star I've seen tonight

476
00:51:31,985 --> 00:51:36,406
Have this wish I wish tonight

477
00:51:41,286 --> 00:51:44,497
The number you have reached
is no longer in service.

478
00:51:46,458 --> 00:51:49,168
Hello, Hollywood Wax Museum.
Can I help you?

479
00:51:50,295 --> 00:51:53,006
This is operator 149.
What city and listing?

480
00:51:53,173 --> 00:51:58,135
I don't know. Hollywood.
A listing for Celebrity Films,
and I need an address.

481
00:51:58,343 --> 00:52:00,680
Please hold for
phone number and address.

482
00:52:24,077 --> 00:52:26,580
- I was here first.
- Sorry, I'll just be a couple minutes.

483
00:52:29,707 --> 00:52:32,377
- Eddie Poole?
- A process server?

484
00:52:32,543 --> 00:52:37,256
No, I've been inquiring around if,
by any chance, you've seen this girl.

485
00:52:37,840 --> 00:52:40,467
- You a cop?
- I'm a member of her family.

486
00:52:40,675 --> 00:52:44,638
- You know how much pussy
comes through here?
- Please, if you'd just take a look.

487
00:52:44,888 --> 00:52:47,183
It would've been a few years.

488
00:52:55,649 --> 00:52:57,776
Her name is Mary Anne Mathews.

489
00:53:00,403 --> 00:53:04,157
- Never seen her.
- You sure?

490
00:53:05,157 --> 00:53:10,079
I just looked at the picture, didn't I?
Come on. I got a lot of shit to do.

491
00:53:14,125 --> 00:53:16,251
Who's next?

492
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:47,698
This'll be fine.

493
00:54:26,860 --> 00:54:31,238
- What kind of shit are you peddling?
- My tapes sell. People eat the shit up.

494
00:54:31,406 --> 00:54:35,369
I had three jerks returning your tapes
last month. You know how bad it has to be
for a jackass to come back..

495
00:54:35,535 --> 00:54:40,415
with a receipt
and try to fucking return it?

496
00:54:40,581 --> 00:54:43,626
- How bad?
- Get together some upscale product
where the girls still have teeth.

497
00:54:43,834 --> 00:54:49,090
Till then, fuck you!

498
00:54:49,256 --> 00:54:53,552
Does your mother have any teeth?
If she does, send her down, you fuck.

499
00:55:55,152 --> 00:55:57,113
He's not answering.

500
00:56:23,095 --> 00:56:26,682
- Hey, boss.
- There's a case of beer in there.

501
00:56:30,728 --> 00:56:33,523
- How was your day?
- Great.

502
00:56:34,482 --> 00:56:37,650
- Everybody here?
- Everybody but one of the chicks.

503
00:56:37,817 --> 00:56:40,154
- Been watching them?

504
00:57:38,877 --> 00:57:41,045
Eddie! Eddie!

505
00:57:52,514 --> 00:57:55,225
- Celebrity Films.
- Eddie..

506
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:58,437
- I know all about it.
- Yeah, you know about what?

507
00:57:58,686 --> 00:58:01,565
About that girl.. six years ago.

508
00:58:02,733 --> 00:58:05,151
I know what you did to her.

509
00:58:05,777 --> 00:58:08,739
- Who is this?
- You murdered her.

510
00:58:08,946 --> 00:58:13,868
- You and your friends.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

511
00:58:14,076 --> 00:58:18,998
You killed her on film.
Now you're fucked. You're all fucked.

512
00:58:32,635 --> 00:58:33,927
Come on.

513
00:58:39,934 --> 00:58:41,769
Give me something, Eddie.

514
00:58:54,281 --> 00:58:56,200
It's me.

515
00:58:56,367 --> 00:58:58,869
- What do you want?
- I just got a call.

516
00:58:59,077 --> 00:59:01,705
We need to talk, And not on the phone.

517
00:59:01,872 --> 00:59:04,832
So one of us has to get
on a plane, all right?

518
00:59:04,999 --> 00:59:07,877
Blow me, you paranoid fuck.
Fuck! Fuck!

519
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:26,103
So you like to watch, paranoid fuck.

520
00:59:33,402 --> 00:59:37,280
- Phone is listed under "D. Velvet" in Manhattan.
- Dino Velvet.

521
00:59:37,447 --> 00:59:42,245
He's a producer/director/weirdo.
He's like the Jim Jarmusch of S & M.

522
00:59:42,452 --> 00:59:45,122
- How hard is his stuff?
- How hard do you want it?

523
00:59:45,288 --> 00:59:48,874
Bondage, fetish, Gothic hard-core.
Definitely not for the squeamish.

524
00:59:49,041 --> 00:59:53,253
Kind of hard to come by. Mostly out
of the back of bondage magazines.

525
00:59:53,462 --> 00:59:57,133
But he's got fans.
This guy I know, he thinks it's art.

526
00:59:57,341 --> 01:00:02,721
He's told me Velvet will do
commissions if there's enough dough.
Nothing illegal, but borderline.

527
01:00:02,888 --> 01:00:07,100
- If a guy wants to see a transvestite in a rubber suit..
- I got the picture.

528
01:00:07,267 --> 01:00:09,644
Max, get in here!

529
01:00:10,395 --> 01:00:13,356
So.. you're going to New York?

530
01:00:13,481 --> 01:00:15,150
Maybe.

531
01:00:15,357 --> 01:00:18,987
Looking like that. You'll need me.

532
01:00:19,154 --> 01:00:24,034
This Frenchie guy is more
than just a fan of Velvet films.
I can get you in if you want to.

533
01:00:24,825 --> 01:00:29,204
- For more money, of course.
- Plus expenses. I fly first class.

534
01:00:29,413 --> 01:00:31,165
So when are we leaving?

535
01:00:35,669 --> 01:00:37,628
What are you doing?

536
01:00:37,838 --> 01:00:41,633
Man, my first time in the Big Bad Apple.

537
01:00:43,677 --> 01:00:47,848
- I told you, don't film me.
- Fine, Howard Hughes.

538
01:00:57,148 --> 01:01:00,276
You didn't say it'd be this luxurious.

539
01:01:00,401 --> 01:01:03,363
- It's the Presidential suite.
- A comforting sense of humor.

540
01:01:03,571 --> 01:01:08,450
- I'll be a couple of doors down.
- Seriously Tom, I don't know why
we're staying in this fleabag.

541
01:01:08,617 --> 01:01:10,827
People mind their own business
in fleabags.

542
01:01:10,994 --> 01:01:15,165
I'm going out for a couple of hours. You
dig up whatever Dino Velvet tapes you can
find. Get receipts.

543
01:01:16,833 --> 01:01:18,627
Yes, sir.

544
01:01:18,834 --> 01:01:21,712
My husband had five cash accounts he used.

545
01:01:21,838 --> 01:01:25,884
Between November 1992..

546
01:01:26,092 --> 01:01:29,221
And March 1993..

547
01:01:29,970 --> 01:01:33,516
he wrote one check out
to cash from each account.

548
01:01:34,850 --> 01:01:39,647
My husband never dealt with money
personally, certainly not cash.

549
01:01:39,855 --> 01:01:42,315
These checks he wrote
are for very odd amounts.

550
01:01:42,482 --> 01:01:45,820
When totaled together, the five checks..

551
01:01:46,028 --> 01:01:50,573
from the five different accounts,
they equal $1 million.

552
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:53,159
That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.

553
01:01:53,368 --> 01:01:58,582
I only mentioned this because you asked me
to look for anything unusual.

554
01:01:58,749 --> 01:02:01,334
I've got about $5000 left in cash.

555
01:02:01,542 --> 01:02:05,088
I'll need another 50, if you approve
the plan I mentioned earlier.

556
01:02:05,296 --> 01:02:10,884
- I'm very close to identifying the man in the mask.
- I'll have Mr. Longdale arrange it.

557
01:02:11,051 --> 01:02:15,015
- How will I get it to you?
- I'll give you the address.

558
01:02:15,305 --> 01:02:18,350
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

559
01:03:19,366 --> 01:03:22,619
Who is this? In the mask, who is he?

560
01:03:23,537 --> 01:03:25,498
Come on, wake up. Who is this?

561
01:03:25,706 --> 01:03:28,667
One of Dino's lunatics.
He's in a bunch of these.

562
01:03:28,833 --> 01:03:32,879
- What's his name?
- I don't know. That's his whole thing.

563
01:03:33,088 --> 01:03:38,009
He always wears a mask.
He calls himself Machete, No, Machine.

564
01:03:38,218 --> 01:03:40,512
He calls himself Machine.

565
01:03:42,430 --> 01:03:44,557
He's a lover, man.

566
01:03:44,766 --> 01:03:47,686
Definitely loves
what he does for a living.

567
01:03:47,935 --> 01:03:50,562
Can't say the same about you.

568
01:04:00,906 --> 01:04:03,200
Yes, yes, yes, yes!

569
01:04:04,118 --> 01:04:06,786
You can see they really
appreciate my style here.

570
01:04:06,912 --> 01:04:10,749
I'm not the kind to blend in
with the crowd, if you didn't notice.

571
01:04:10,916 --> 01:04:14,210
Like these ladies here,
they like my style.

572
01:04:18,882 --> 01:04:21,593
- Who is it?
- This is Max California.

573
01:04:21,801 --> 01:04:24,679
I called earlier.
I'm a friend of Frenchie's, from L.A.

574
01:04:24,887 --> 01:04:29,183
- My partner and I would like to speak to Mr. Velvet.
- He is not here.

575
01:04:29,350 --> 01:04:34,312
We have to give him a large sum of money.
If he's not interested, we'll split.

576
01:04:50,995 --> 01:04:56,208
What are you talking about?
Can't you just answer my simple question?

577
01:04:58,211 --> 01:05:01,839
I asked a question!
Where the fuck is Laura?!

578
01:05:02,006 --> 01:05:04,842
I've been asking you that
the last 10 minutes.

579
01:05:05,051 --> 01:05:07,178
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

580
01:05:07,970 --> 01:05:11,015
You idiot! Going to shoot in two days?

581
01:05:11,182 --> 01:05:15,852
Man, you're spending my money.
Yeah, you better do that.

582
01:05:16,061 --> 01:05:17,771
Fucking asshole!

583
01:05:17,980 --> 01:05:20,440
It's an honor to meet you.
Thank you for seeing us.

584
01:05:25,820 --> 01:05:29,991
- So, what can I do you for?
- We would like to order a movie.

585
01:05:30,157 --> 01:05:33,620
- We'd like to commission a film.
A Dino Velvet original, one of a kind.
- That's right.

586
01:05:34,663 --> 01:05:38,957
- I'm a huge admirer of yours.
- God, I love flattery.

587
01:05:39,625 --> 01:05:42,336
You're a genius, Mr. Velvet.
A goddamn genius.

588
01:05:42,503 --> 01:05:48,257
The only one still transferring film
to video. Nobody really appreciates
that kind of integrity anymore.

589
01:05:48,424 --> 01:05:51,427
The grain and the gritty look you get.

590
01:05:54,014 --> 01:05:59,435
- Which is your favourite?
- If I had to choose, it'd either be
Choke or Devil.

591
01:05:59,644 --> 01:06:03,356
The subliminal imagery in Choke
is what gets under your skin.

592
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:08,652
Well, Devil frightened me
as much as it excited me..

593
01:06:08,819 --> 01:06:11,530
but I'd be hard-pressed
to choose a favourite.

594
01:06:15,785 --> 01:06:18,620
What kind of a budget
are we talking about?

595
01:06:19,538 --> 01:06:23,584
Five thousand now;
Five thousand upon delivery.

596
01:06:23,709 --> 01:06:28,505
Two women, one white and one black.
Hard bondage, of course.

597
01:06:28,714 --> 01:06:34,301
Other than that, trusting your artistic interpretation..
..I only have two stipulations.

598
01:06:38,931 --> 01:06:41,351
Okay, challenge me.

599
01:06:42,644 --> 01:06:44,396
I want to watch you work.

600
01:06:45,312 --> 01:06:48,314
You don't want a franchise, do you?

601
01:06:48,523 --> 01:06:51,318
Steal the recipe for my secret..

602
01:06:51,526 --> 01:06:53,486
hot sauce?

603
01:06:54,488 --> 01:06:55,947
No.

604
01:06:57,700 --> 01:07:00,327
That's good. I appreciate that.

605
01:07:05,957 --> 01:07:09,293
- Second stipulation.
- The other performer..

606
01:07:09,961 --> 01:07:13,630
has to be.. that animal you use.

607
01:07:13,839 --> 01:07:18,052
- The man in the mask.
- Machine.

608
01:07:25,099 --> 01:07:27,061
I don't know.

609
01:07:27,227 --> 01:07:30,021
He might be interested.

610
01:07:30,230 --> 01:07:32,940
But I think it'll cost you another..

611
01:07:35,818 --> 01:07:37,904
five to seven grand.

612
01:07:38,113 --> 01:07:42,241
- I can arrange something really special for ten.
- You can do that.

613
01:07:42,450 --> 01:07:44,911
Good enough for me.

614
01:07:45,702 --> 01:07:49,081
I'll just have to put my thinking cap on.

615
01:07:53,293 --> 01:07:56,464
I'm going to keep this as a deposit.

616
01:07:56,631 --> 01:07:59,342
You make sure you call me
after 10 o'clock tonight.

617
01:07:59,509 --> 01:08:01,468
10 o'clock.

618
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:09,476
You know, you have a very special,
very beautiful face.

619
01:08:09,643 --> 01:08:12,354
The way light hits it.

620
01:08:12,521 --> 01:08:14,981
I'd like to shoot you.

621
01:08:15,190 --> 01:08:18,526
- You don't mind?
- I'm camera-shy.

622
01:08:18,735 --> 01:08:21,696
You trust me to take your money,
but not your picture?

623
01:08:21,821 --> 01:08:26,784
Those are two different kinds of trust.
I hope we can do business.

624
01:08:35,418 --> 01:08:38,545
Hoyt Avenue, Brooklyn, 3 o'clock.

625
01:08:41,256 --> 01:08:43,175
I'll be there.

626
01:08:45,468 --> 01:08:48,472
I got something to tend to. Thanks.

627
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:52,892
- So are we in the movie business?
- That's for you.

628
01:08:53,018 --> 01:08:55,686
- What is it?
- Money, People use it to purchase goods.

629
01:08:55,854 --> 01:09:01,109
- That's awfully generous and everything
- It's not mine. Don't make a big deal.

630
01:09:01,276 --> 01:09:06,571
There's a plane ticket for the flight
you can catch to L.A. tonight.
This is as far as I want you to go.

631
01:09:06,738 --> 01:09:10,784
What are you talking about?
We're a team. We're partners.

632
01:09:10,993 --> 01:09:15,997
Max, I'm sure you realize
these people we're dealing with..

633
01:09:16,205 --> 01:09:20,544
are extremely disturbed.
- That's why you need me!
I know disturbed. Look at me.

634
01:09:20,752 --> 01:09:23,629
You did a great job.
It's time for you to go home.

635
01:09:23,796 --> 01:09:26,215
But this is, like, our big case.

636
01:09:26,425 --> 01:09:30,385
- Tom, I know what's going on, okay?
- Okay, what?

637
01:09:30,594 --> 01:09:33,597
Dino and Machine and Eddie
made a snuff film, right?

638
01:09:33,806 --> 01:09:37,018
I can't figure out why you're involved.
Maybe the victim?

639
01:09:37,226 --> 01:09:41,271
First, who said you're right?
Second, who said anything about a victim?

640
01:09:41,438 --> 01:09:47,110
Only 3 rules in life, Tom Welles.
One, there's always a victim.
And two, don't be it.

641
01:09:47,277 --> 01:09:49,112
- And three?
- I forgot three.

642
01:09:49,321 --> 01:09:54,868
Good, I want you to forget everything.
I want you to get on a plane to L.A.
and forget it all.

643
01:09:56,286 --> 01:10:00,456
I get calls for work on the West Coast.
I'd like to call you again.

644
01:10:00,623 --> 01:10:03,084
You're going to look me up
and call me?

645
01:10:03,292 --> 01:10:06,837
I could use your help. I meant it
when I said I think you're smart.

646
01:10:07,422 --> 01:10:10,966
- I'm not patronizing you.
- Well, thanks.

647
01:10:11,133 --> 01:10:13,719
All right. You take care, Max California.

648
01:10:19,391 --> 01:10:22,478
All right, Tom Welles.
Devil's waiting on you.

649
01:11:42,053 --> 01:11:43,889
There you are!

650
01:11:44,097 --> 01:11:46,057
Come and join us.

651
01:11:57,234 --> 01:12:00,570
Hello, Machine.. Love your work.

652
01:12:05,825 --> 01:12:08,370
Did you bring the money?

653
01:12:09,913 --> 01:12:12,332
- It's right here.
- Good.

654
01:12:13,708 --> 01:12:16,503
- Where are the women?
- Women..

655
01:12:17,504 --> 01:12:19,547
they're always late.

656
01:12:25,803 --> 01:12:30,140
- What are these for?
- They're just props.

657
01:12:30,349 --> 01:12:33,310
Nice, aren't they? Machine and I..

658
01:12:33,477 --> 01:12:37,063
were just talking
about the beauty of knives.

659
01:12:39,692 --> 01:12:42,360
My guests have arrived!

660
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:49,450
Mr. W., would you be so kind as
to remove any firearms from your person?

661
01:12:50,367 --> 01:12:54,955
- What are you doing?
- I hate to repeat myself.
It makes me look so stupid.

662
01:12:55,748 --> 01:12:59,085
Slowly now.. show me the gun.

663
01:13:00,253 --> 01:13:01,587
Nice and easy!

664
01:13:03,088 --> 01:13:05,008
That's right. Easy.

665
01:13:05,215 --> 01:13:07,092
Good.

666
01:13:07,301 --> 01:13:11,597
- Now empty those bullets onto the table.
- Very carefully.

667
01:13:11,763 --> 01:13:15,182
- I don't know why you think
- Shut up, you fuck!

668
01:13:15,392 --> 01:13:18,854
I'll put an arrow right through
your goddamn throat, you understand?

669
01:13:25,192 --> 01:13:27,029
That's him.

670
01:13:27,237 --> 01:13:30,698
- Last bullet. The last one.
- Good boy.

671
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:34,952
- Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.
- Yes, sir.

672
01:13:35,245 --> 01:13:37,163
Machine!

673
01:13:43,127 --> 01:13:47,005
I didn't know what
to make of you at first.

674
01:13:48,089 --> 01:13:52,134
And you certainly had Eddie here
on pins and needles.

675
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:58,016
Lo and behold, from right
out of the blue came..

676
01:13:58,223 --> 01:14:00,934
an old business acquaintance of ours
to explain everything.

677
01:14:01,143 --> 01:14:03,938
Satan ex machina!

678
01:14:05,231 --> 01:14:07,858
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

679
01:14:10,653 --> 01:14:13,781
- Get it over with.
- Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

680
01:14:14,823 --> 01:14:19,620
What I could do with faces
like these on film.

681
01:14:19,828 --> 01:14:23,123
But on second thought,
why would I need their faces?

682
01:14:24,124 --> 01:14:27,251
You listen to me, You'll get that film.

683
01:14:27,418 --> 01:14:30,046
You'll bring it back here, give it to me.

684
01:14:30,254 --> 01:14:34,717
Just so we make this
as efficient as possible..

685
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:37,303
there is an incentive.

686
01:14:47,939 --> 01:14:51,984
He's got nothing to do with this.
He doesn't know anything.

687
01:14:52,192 --> 01:14:56,279
Can't you guess what
I'm about to say next?!

688
01:14:57,364 --> 01:14:59,700
If you don't bring me that film..

689
01:14:59,908 --> 01:15:03,870
we're going to kill him,
fuck him.. and film it.

690
01:15:06,747 --> 01:15:09,542
If that's not enough for you..

691
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:12,378
we're going to go after your family.

692
01:15:14,839 --> 01:15:16,424
I'll get the film.

693
01:15:18,718 --> 01:15:22,013
Good boy. You're being very cooperative.

694
01:15:22,221 --> 01:15:24,849
Mr. Longdale here will keep you company.

695
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:29,394
- Why me?
- Because I do not like you, Mr. Longdale.

696
01:15:38,903 --> 01:15:40,864
Mr W..

697
01:15:43,575 --> 01:15:44,908
hurry back.

698
01:15:49,413 --> 01:15:53,460
Since I met you, there isn't much you've
done that I haven't been party to.

699
01:15:53,667 --> 01:15:56,629
None of this would be happening
if you'd given up.

700
01:15:56,837 --> 01:16:01,717
Or not taken the job in the first place.
I never expected you to get this far.

701
01:16:01,925 --> 01:16:05,888
I hired you because you're young
and completely out of your league.

702
01:16:06,055 --> 01:16:08,766
But I underestimated your ambition.

703
01:16:08,932 --> 01:16:13,353
You took one look at the Christian compound.
It was heady, wasn't it?

704
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:17,398
You weren't peeking through the gates.
Mrs. Christian welcomed you in.

705
01:16:17,565 --> 01:16:20,818
Do you think people like
the Christians hire people like us..

706
01:16:21,026 --> 01:16:23,404
as an invitation
to their dinner parties?

707
01:16:23,613 --> 01:16:27,658
No, we're there to clean up the mess,
to wipe their royal asses.

708
01:16:27,825 --> 01:16:32,789
You were asked to buy a snuff film.
They couldn't find one, so you paid them
to make one.

709
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:34,706
Isn't that what happened?

710
01:16:34,873 --> 01:16:37,584
She was alive till you paid
to have her murdered?

711
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:41,253
How much did Christian
pay for your conscience? A million?

712
01:16:41,462 --> 01:16:44,800
I've been well compensated.
But you, I bought cheap.

713
01:16:46,676 --> 01:16:51,222
Just because Mrs. Christian praised your discretion..
..you sat on evidence of murder,

714
01:16:51,430 --> 01:16:55,976
dragged your friend, family..
..into some old graveyard..

715
01:16:56,185 --> 01:16:59,855
to dig up a dead girl with no name
that nobody remembers.

716
01:17:00,106 --> 01:17:03,942
Mary Anne Mathews. That was her name.
Her mother remembers her.

717
01:17:04,150 --> 01:17:08,406
I'm bored with this.
You know the difference between us?

718
01:17:08,613 --> 01:17:13,243
I will survive this and profit by it,
whereas you.. you will not.

719
01:17:13,451 --> 01:17:15,787
Now get the film.

720
01:17:20,292 --> 01:17:22,793
- Did you watch it with him?
- What?

721
01:17:23,002 --> 01:17:27,589
- The snuff film. Did you watch it with him?
- This isn't helping your friend. Get the film.

722
01:17:27,756 --> 01:17:32,970
Did it get him off? Mr. Christian?
Watching them cut her up like that?
Did he jerk off to it?

723
01:17:33,137 --> 01:17:36,515
Did you hold his cock?
Give him the hand job..

724
01:17:36,724 --> 01:17:39,311
while Mary Anne Mathews was dying?!

725
01:17:39,435 --> 01:17:42,103
- What are you doing?
- Trying to understand!

726
01:17:42,270 --> 01:17:45,481
- What did he want with a snuff film?!
- "Why" ..?

727
01:17:45,733 --> 01:17:47,817
Yes, why? Why?!

728
01:17:48,026 --> 01:17:52,448
Why did he want a film..
..of a little girl being butchered?!

729
01:17:53,740 --> 01:17:57,410
Because he could.
He did it because he could.

730
01:17:59,578 --> 01:18:01,789
What reason were you looking for?

731
01:18:05,375 --> 01:18:06,710
Now.

732
01:18:20,515 --> 01:18:22,267
Here.

733
01:18:22,434 --> 01:18:24,435
Shoot me.

734
01:18:32,277 --> 01:18:35,071
Mr. Welles, the film, please.

735
01:18:35,738 --> 01:18:39,282
Let him go first. Do whatever you want
to me, but let him go.

736
01:18:39,492 --> 01:18:42,370
Very well. Set him free, Machine.

737
01:19:17,194 --> 01:19:19,072
- Is that it?
- That's it.

738
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:21,073
Bravo.

739
01:19:21,823 --> 01:19:25,034
You don't want to miss this.. Mr. Welles.

740
01:19:34,419 --> 01:19:36,045
So it ends.

741
01:19:38,172 --> 01:19:40,882
As if she never existed.

742
01:19:41,092 --> 01:19:44,804
Do not blame yourself;
You were in way over your head.

743
01:19:45,013 --> 01:19:47,265
You motherfuckers!

744
01:19:48,307 --> 01:19:51,811
You small-time motherfuckers.

745
01:19:53,146 --> 01:19:54,856
I want to know something.

746
01:19:55,105 --> 01:19:59,027
Why you're still small-time with a
million dollars to spread around?

747
01:19:59,693 --> 01:20:01,486
Million?

748
01:20:01,695 --> 01:20:05,741
Yeah! That's what Christian gave Longdale!
That's what he gave you, right?

749
01:20:05,907 --> 01:20:09,703
A million in cash?
You stupid fucking trash!

750
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:13,664
What the hell ..?
Is he talking dollars here?

751
01:20:13,873 --> 01:20:15,541
No, he's lying.

752
01:20:15,666 --> 01:20:17,961
Did you fuck me?

753
01:20:18,169 --> 01:20:20,796
- Did you fuck me on this?
- Of course not, Edward!

754
01:20:20,964 --> 01:20:26,259
- Then what's he talking about?
- He's saying that Longdale fucked us..

755
01:20:26,385 --> 01:20:29,263
which is so totally, completely bizarre.

756
01:20:29,971 --> 01:20:31,348
Stay back.

757
01:20:31,514 --> 01:20:34,310
Stay away from me. Put the bow down!

758
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:38,063
I told you not to trust the prick.

759
01:20:38,229 --> 01:20:43,360
Mr. Longdale, if there's no honor..
..among perverts and pornographers..
..the whole business would fall apart.

760
01:20:43,526 --> 01:20:47,404
Because there's no records,
no contracts, no legal recourse.

761
01:20:47,571 --> 01:20:50,533
So if someone.. cheats us..

762
01:20:50,741 --> 01:20:55,162
that person can't be trusted.
That person could turn us in,
have us killed.

763
01:20:55,371 --> 01:20:59,625
So we don't have a choice,
do we, Mr. Longdale?

764
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:03,045
I want this to be over.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

765
01:21:03,252 --> 01:21:05,798
- Eddie, take your gun out.
- Fuck you.

766
01:21:06,006 --> 01:21:08,132
Take it out now! And drop it.

767
01:21:08,299 --> 01:21:12,220
- Or I will shoot.
- Don't be stupid, Edward.

768
01:21:17,266 --> 01:21:20,144
Kick it in my direction.

769
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:24,941
Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.

770
01:21:29,404 --> 01:21:30,822
Action.

771
01:21:41,833 --> 01:21:43,543
This is wrong.

772
01:21:43,710 --> 01:21:45,836
Something's wrong.

773
01:21:46,044 --> 01:21:47,587
God, not like this.

774
01:21:49,338 --> 01:21:52,134
I am supposed to have..

775
01:21:52,301 --> 01:21:54,135
something more cinematic.

776
01:21:55,012 --> 01:21:57,723
Kill them, Machine.

777
01:21:57,889 --> 01:21:59,598
Kill them all!

778
01:22:33,256 --> 01:22:34,923
Machine!

779
01:22:47,519 --> 01:22:49,271
Stop, Eddie!

780
01:22:49,480 --> 01:22:51,940
I swear to Christ,
I'll shoot you in the back!

781
01:22:54,192 --> 01:22:56,570
Take off the mask.

782
01:22:56,737 --> 01:22:58,696
Remove the hood!!

783
01:22:59,155 --> 01:23:01,407
Take off the fucking mask!
He's only got one bullet!

784
01:24:16,313 --> 01:24:18,105
Damn!

785
01:24:37,624 --> 01:24:40,252
Amy, listen carefully.

786
01:24:40,460 --> 01:24:42,712
- Tom, where are you?
- Amy, just listen.

787
01:24:42,921 --> 01:24:47,592
Take Cindy. Get out of the house now.
Go to where we spent 4h of July weekend.

788
01:24:47,800 --> 01:24:52,931
- Why? What's wrong?
- Amy, please. I can't. I'll be there in three hours.

789
01:24:53,097 --> 01:24:57,143
- I'm on my way! Go now!
- Tom, you're scaring me.

790
01:24:57,310 --> 01:24:59,020
Please, Amy, just do it!

791
01:24:59,187 --> 01:25:02,147
Okay, bye. I'm going.

792
01:25:09,446 --> 01:25:11,490
Mrs. Christian, it's Tom Welles.

793
01:25:11,657 --> 01:25:14,826
Longdale is dead. He was killed by the men
who made the film.

794
01:25:15,035 --> 01:25:19,997
He hired them for your husband. Kept
most of the million. The film is real!

795
01:25:20,206 --> 01:25:22,500
They killed that girl!

796
01:25:23,626 --> 01:25:27,588
- Mrs. Christian?
- I'm still here, Mr. Welles.

797
01:25:27,755 --> 01:25:30,967
- I am sorry.
- I know this must be, Are you in danger?

798
01:25:31,132 --> 01:25:35,554
We must go to the police. I tell tonight,
We'll call the police in the morning.

799
01:25:36,096 --> 01:25:38,266
All right.. Eight o'clock?

800
01:25:38,474 --> 01:25:40,225
Yes, eight o'clock is fine.

801
01:25:40,433 --> 01:25:43,396
Do you know..

802
01:25:43,562 --> 01:25:46,274
what the poor girl's name was?

803
01:25:46,440 --> 01:25:47,983
Mary.

804
01:25:48,191 --> 01:25:51,361
- Mary Anne Mathews.
- Mary.

805
01:25:53,612 --> 01:25:56,657
Thank you, Mr. Welles. Goodbye.

806
01:26:47,497 --> 01:26:49,374
Amy!

807
01:26:52,627 --> 01:26:55,713
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

808
01:26:55,923 --> 01:26:57,758
Are you?

809
01:26:57,966 --> 01:27:00,092
Why have not you called me?

810
01:27:02,888 --> 01:27:05,933
Why did you disappear
off the face of the Earth?

811
01:27:07,100 --> 01:27:08,977
You're bleeding.

812
01:27:09,185 --> 01:27:13,564
Are those handcuffs?
Were you locked up?

813
01:27:13,689 --> 01:27:16,025
Kept from a phone? What happened?

814
01:27:16,233 --> 01:27:21,488
Start talking, Tom.
Because if you want to stay married,
you can't treat me this way!

815
01:27:22,364 --> 01:27:25,241
You are right.
Everything you say is right.

816
01:27:27,828 --> 01:27:31,789
That won't do it. That's not enough, Tom.
Not anymore.

817
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:35,126
I'm not going to let
anything happen to us.

818
01:27:35,334 --> 01:27:37,754
Look where we are!

819
01:27:37,963 --> 01:27:40,382
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself! Look!

820
01:27:41,423 --> 01:27:46,220
You son of a bitch.
You don't even have any idea
what you're putting me through.

821
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:51,558
What was I supposed to think
happened to you?

822
01:27:55,145 --> 01:27:56,771
Amy..

823
01:27:56,980 --> 01:27:59,190
We're going to stay here a few days.

824
01:27:59,400 --> 01:28:03,653
It's just a few days. I'm sorry.
There's no other way around this.

825
01:28:03,861 --> 01:28:06,114
I swear, I swear..

826
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:11,077
I won't let anything happen to us.
I'll take care of this.

827
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:12,578
I swear it.

828
01:28:12,745 --> 01:28:15,206
I swear it.

829
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:20,128
Now I have to go back out.

830
01:28:20,295 --> 01:28:22,796
Where?

831
01:28:24,298 --> 01:28:27,092
I have to see Mrs. Christian.

832
01:28:27,259 --> 01:28:30,053
She is the only witness.

833
01:28:30,220 --> 01:28:32,221
To what?

834
01:28:33,724 --> 01:28:36,184
We're going to be okay.

835
01:28:38,477 --> 01:28:40,564
We're going to be okay.

836
01:28:43,150 --> 01:28:45,151
It'll work..

837
01:28:53,743 --> 01:28:57,787
- Tom Welles. Mrs. Christian's expecting me.
- Yes, she left instructions.

838
01:28:58,705 --> 01:29:00,957
I have to see her now.
It's extremely urgent.

839
01:29:01,791 --> 01:29:05,337
Mrs. Christian chose to take
her own life this afternoon, Mr. Welles.

840
01:29:10,508 --> 01:29:12,217
But I just..

841
01:29:12,427 --> 01:29:16,680
No, no, I just..
..I just spoke to her.

842
01:29:16,847 --> 01:29:22,145
Her instructions were that this first envelope..
..is for Mary's family.

843
01:29:22,353 --> 01:29:25,940
She wrote that you'd understand
what that meant.

844
01:29:26,148 --> 01:29:28,609
And the second envelope is for you.

845
01:29:30,277 --> 01:29:35,449
Services will be held next week,
if you'd like to attend.

846
01:29:35,658 --> 01:29:37,533
I'm sorry, sir.

847
01:29:37,701 --> 01:29:39,077
Good night, sir.

848
01:29:57,720 --> 01:30:00,598
Try to forget us.

849
01:30:13,277 --> 01:30:15,569
What are you doing?

850
01:30:17,364 --> 01:30:20,033
I have to go back.

851
01:30:29,667 --> 01:30:31,670
Whatever it is..

852
01:30:31,837 --> 01:30:35,256
Wherever you were.. just forget about it.

853
01:30:36,131 --> 01:30:38,050
You stay here.

854
01:30:38,259 --> 01:30:40,303
I can't.

855
01:30:42,637 --> 01:30:46,099
And risk us?
Risk your family? Why?

856
01:30:47,058 --> 01:30:50,186
There's no one left
to finish this but me.

857
01:30:50,353 --> 01:30:53,273
I'll call you when it's safe to go home.

858
01:30:55,232 --> 01:30:58,570
We may not be there
when you get back.

859
01:31:11,373 --> 01:31:14,585
Cindy's education, and a lot more.

860
01:31:23,885 --> 01:31:25,846
I love you.

861
01:32:15,184 --> 01:32:18,145
Put your hands on your head.
Down on your knees.

862
01:32:19,271 --> 01:32:21,399
You think I'm fucking around?

863
01:32:24,192 --> 01:32:26,570
- Hurts, doesn't it?
- What the fuck do you want?

864
01:32:26,779 --> 01:32:29,323
Who's Machine? Where does he live?

865
01:32:30,073 --> 01:32:32,909
- I do not know.
- I want his name.

866
01:32:33,076 --> 01:32:35,286
I don't know his fucking name.

867
01:32:38,248 --> 01:32:41,293
- I will never get tired of hurting you.
- I don't know his name.

868
01:32:41,459 --> 01:32:44,587
He shows up in his mask,
he leaves in his mask.

869
01:32:44,753 --> 01:32:47,840
He's from New York somewhere.

870
01:32:51,386 --> 01:32:53,637
Get in the car!

871
01:32:55,222 --> 01:32:58,600
- Why?
- You're going to show me where he killed her.

872
01:32:59,435 --> 01:33:00,769
Fuck you!

873
01:33:02,938 --> 01:33:04,814
All right, you fuck.

874
01:33:18,161 --> 01:33:21,372
What did you do
before you brought her here?

875
01:33:21,539 --> 01:33:23,957
Tell her how beautiful she was..

876
01:33:25,043 --> 01:33:28,004
how you'd make her a big star?

877
01:33:32,257 --> 01:33:34,469
Talk her up?

878
01:33:37,887 --> 01:33:40,264
What the fuck do you want from me?

879
01:33:43,894 --> 01:33:45,853
I want to know.

880
01:33:48,607 --> 01:33:51,025
- You want to know?
- Yes.

881
01:33:53,694 --> 01:33:56,656
She was nothing;
A Little pussy off the street.

882
01:33:56,864 --> 01:33:59,825
Girl like that disappears,
nobody gives a shit.

883
01:34:00,909 --> 01:34:04,789
Yeah, I talked her up.
Told her what she wanted to hear,

884
01:34:04,955 --> 01:34:09,960
That she'd be a star.. she'd make a lot
of money and all the rest of the bullshit.

885
01:34:10,168 --> 01:34:14,631
When I was finished, she was all
excited about her big screen test.

886
01:34:15,841 --> 01:34:17,550
I called up Dino..

887
01:34:17,716 --> 01:34:21,764
he and Machine flew out here.
We had a little party.

888
01:34:22,304 --> 01:34:24,723
What else you want to know?

889
01:34:24,933 --> 01:34:27,184
You saw the film, right?

890
01:34:27,351 --> 01:34:29,937
You know the ending.

891
01:34:30,813 --> 01:34:33,524
Nobody else saw you bring her in?

892
01:34:35,359 --> 01:34:38,486
Who's going to see?
Place is a fucking shithole.

893
01:34:41,657 --> 01:34:44,535
I brought her in and she..

894
01:34:45,243 --> 01:34:47,787
Saw Machine stand in the corner.

895
01:34:49,039 --> 01:34:51,332
She started crying..

896
01:34:52,500 --> 01:34:54,920
making these little noises.

897
01:34:56,505 --> 01:34:59,507
So I slapped her around a bit
just to shut her up.

898
01:34:59,717 --> 01:35:02,594
Dino.. fed her a bunch of pills.

899
01:35:04,429 --> 01:35:07,014
Machine put down the plastic over here.

900
01:35:10,142 --> 01:35:12,269
Just started cutting her up.

901
01:35:15,647 --> 01:35:17,774
That's it. She's dead.

902
01:35:17,941 --> 01:35:21,153
She has been dead a long time
Nobody gives a shit but you.

903
01:35:35,333 --> 01:35:38,294
You wanted to know.. now you know.

904
01:35:40,795 --> 01:35:45,635
You were in here. You were here and saw
Mary Anne bleed to death from here.

905
01:35:47,303 --> 01:35:48,888
Why?

906
01:35:50,096 --> 01:35:52,432
Why did you watch?

907
01:35:52,641 --> 01:35:54,976
I felt like it.

908
01:35:56,019 --> 01:35:58,688
I never saw nobody get done.

909
01:35:58,855 --> 01:36:02,942
Why? Did you get hard? Did you come?

910
01:36:03,151 --> 01:36:05,778
No. It made me sick.

911
01:36:05,986 --> 01:36:11,659
But what do I give a shit..
..if some rich fucking wacko wants
to beat off to something like that?

912
01:36:11,867 --> 01:36:13,202
Stay down!

913
01:36:15,536 --> 01:36:18,249
It was something I did for money.

914
01:36:20,042 --> 01:36:22,254
I needed the fucking money.

915
01:36:22,419 --> 01:36:25,464
Where is she? Where did you put her body?

916
01:36:25,673 --> 01:36:29,884
I buried it in the woods.
You won't find it.

917
01:36:30,094 --> 01:36:34,848
And even if you do, what do you got?
You got a girl's skeleton, that's it.

918
01:36:35,057 --> 01:36:37,308
Without the film, you got nothing.

919
01:36:37,934 --> 01:36:42,229
All you can do is cut me loose.
Without the film, you got nothing.

920
01:36:42,396 --> 01:36:45,900
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Hands behind your back.

921
01:36:46,817 --> 01:36:49,653
- Fuck you!
- Put your hands behind your back!

922
01:36:55,576 --> 01:36:57,911
What the fuck are you doing?

923
01:37:03,500 --> 01:37:05,961
I'm going to kill you.

924
01:37:06,712 --> 01:37:09,088
I'm going to kill you.

925
01:37:10,173 --> 01:37:13,467
And I'm going to leave you here
just like you left her.

926
01:37:15,303 --> 01:37:18,681
You're not going to kill me.
You don't have it in you.

927
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:24,270
You going to shoot me with your own gun?
Registered in your name?

928
01:37:26,731 --> 01:37:28,941
You thought this through,
didn't you, genius?

929
01:37:29,149 --> 01:37:33,194
You'll have to dig the bullets
out of my head.

930
01:37:35,572 --> 01:37:39,367
That'll be nice.

931
01:37:39,534 --> 01:37:43,580
Or you could dig a hole. Dig it
with your own hands and bury me
next to your girlfriend.

932
01:37:43,747 --> 01:37:46,207
Go ahead. Pull the fucking trigger.
Go ahead.

933
01:37:46,374 --> 01:37:49,961
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, do it. You faggot!

934
01:37:52,463 --> 01:37:56,383
What do you want me to do?
Start crying? Like a baby?
" I'm so sorry I killed the girl."

935
01:37:56,550 --> 01:37:58,385
Fuck you! And fuck her!

936
01:37:58,594 --> 01:38:02,349
Go ahead, put me out of my misery.
Pull the fucking trigger.

937
01:38:03,598 --> 01:38:05,059
Pull the fucking trigger.

938
01:38:05,601 --> 01:38:07,144
Do it!

939
01:38:07,353 --> 01:38:08,854
Do it!

940
01:38:15,443 --> 01:38:17,737
You can not do it.

941
01:38:17,988 --> 01:38:19,822
You little pansy bitch!

942
01:38:20,031 --> 01:38:24,953
Look at your, Big fucking hero man.
You can't fucking do it.

943
01:38:26,870 --> 01:38:28,747
Look at him.

944
01:38:28,914 --> 01:38:31,334
Big fucking hero.

945
01:38:31,542 --> 01:38:33,836
Go on home to your wifey!

946
01:38:34,711 --> 01:38:36,255
You pussy!

947
01:38:37,005 --> 01:38:38,800
You big fucking pussy!

948
01:38:40,634 --> 01:38:43,679
What are you going to do now, faggot?

949
01:38:45,180 --> 01:38:47,558
You can't go to the cops!

950
01:38:48,600 --> 01:38:53,146
Send me your wife and daughter.
We'll make a film, you faggot!

951
01:38:55,606 --> 01:38:57,651
Shit!

952
01:38:57,817 --> 01:38:59,819
You punk-ass!

953
01:39:44,111 --> 01:39:46,237
Mrs. Mathews?

954
01:39:46,447 --> 01:39:48,324
It's Thomas.

955
01:39:48,490 --> 01:39:52,702
Thomas Hart. I was there a few weeks ago
asking about your daughter.

956
01:39:52,869 --> 01:39:56,415
Yeah, you found her diary.

957
01:39:56,624 --> 01:39:58,334
Thank you.

958
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,835
She did leave a note..

959
01:40:01,044 --> 01:40:06,674
and her stupid boyfriend dumped her
in California.. so I told the FBI.

960
01:40:07,842 --> 01:40:09,928
Remember when..

961
01:40:10,094 --> 01:40:14,973
When I asked
if you wanted to know.. truth?

962
01:40:15,974 --> 01:40:17,851
No matter what?

963
01:40:18,060 --> 01:40:22,022
Some men, they took her and
they killed her and they buried her.

964
01:40:23,316 --> 01:40:25,858
I'm sorry.

965
01:40:26,526 --> 01:40:28,487
I want to punish them for what they did.

966
01:40:29,196 --> 01:40:32,908
- Why are you saying this?
- I can hurt them.

967
01:40:33,115 --> 01:40:36,369
Give me your permission,
to hurt them, please.

968
01:40:37,537 --> 01:40:40,206
Tell me how much she meant to you.

969
01:40:40,289 --> 01:40:44,001
Just tell me that you loved her.
Please tell me that you loved her.

970
01:40:44,168 --> 01:40:48,129
I love her..
I love her so much!

971
01:40:50,216 --> 01:40:53,010
I loved her so much ..!

972
01:40:59,224 --> 01:41:01,017
Who's that?
Die, you motherfucker, die!

973
01:42:39,695 --> 01:42:42,405
- New York hospital.
- Connect me to the duty nurse.

974
01:42:42,614 --> 01:42:46,159
- Emergency.
- It's Lt. Anderson of the 13th precinct.

975
01:42:46,326 --> 01:42:50,831
Have you admitted an adult male with an
abdominal wound.. in the last 48 hours?

976
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:53,749
- A stabbing incident.
- Abdominal wound?

977
01:42:53,917 --> 01:42:56,126
- No, not one.
- Thank you.

978
01:42:56,336 --> 01:42:59,880
I'm looking for a stabbing victim.
Male. Maybe six feet.

979
01:43:00,089 --> 01:43:05,052
- Filed a bogus report.
- We had a guy in on Monday, I think.

980
01:43:05,261 --> 01:43:08,472
- It would've been yesterday or the day before yesterday.
- Sorry.

981
01:43:08,639 --> 01:43:11,892
- Queens County Emergency.
- Hi, Lt. Anderson.

982
01:43:12,101 --> 01:43:16,397
We had a stabbing incident and
supposed victim gave us a false name.

983
01:43:16,521 --> 01:43:20,483
- A male with an abdominal wound.
- Hold on. Let me check my records.

984
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:23,111
There was a patient treated yesterday.

985
01:43:23,278 --> 01:43:27,241
- Star tattoo on his right hand?
- Yes. George Anthony Higgins.

986
01:43:27,449 --> 01:43:31,743
Insurance policy is under his
mother's name, Doris Veronica Higgins.

987
01:43:31,910 --> 01:43:35,123
- That's him. Can you give me an address?
- It's under her address.

988
01:43:35,331 --> 01:43:37,833
Douglaston. Need a street?

989
01:44:11,908 --> 01:44:16,746
- I reality wish you'd go to church with me tonight.
- Maybe next week.

990
01:44:20,207 --> 01:44:22,417
I love you, son.

991
01:44:25,587 --> 01:44:28,715
I'll be home by 10. Bye-bye.

992
01:49:09,524 --> 01:49:13,861
You know the best part of killing someone?
The look on their face.

993
01:49:14,070 --> 01:49:17,156
It's that look..
not when they're threatened..

994
01:49:17,365 --> 01:49:21,785
not when you hurt them..
not even when they see the knife.

995
01:49:21,952 --> 01:49:25,372
It's when they feel the knife go in.

996
01:49:25,957 --> 01:49:29,543
That's it. It's surprise. They cannot
believe it's really happening.

997
01:49:29,793 --> 01:49:32,879
She had that look.

998
01:49:33,087 --> 01:49:37,050
The girl, when she knew it wasn't just porno.
You feel how hard I am?

999
01:49:47,351 --> 01:49:48,769
Take off the mask.

1000
01:50:04,410 --> 01:50:07,079
What did you expect, a monster?

1001
01:50:14,127 --> 01:50:17,838
My name's George.
You probably knew that already.

1002
01:50:20,674 --> 01:50:22,802
Can't get your mind around it, huh?

1003
01:50:23,011 --> 01:50:27,472
I don't have any answers.
Nothing I can say will
make you sleep easier at night.

1004
01:50:27,682 --> 01:50:30,475
I wasn't beaten. I wasn't molested.

1005
01:50:30,685 --> 01:50:33,145
Mommy didn't abuse me.

1006
01:50:33,980 --> 01:50:36,523
Daddy never raped me.

1007
01:50:36,731 --> 01:50:39,860
I'm only what I am.
That's all there is to it!

1008
01:50:52,205 --> 01:50:53,915
There's no mystery.

1009
01:50:54,081 --> 01:50:57,585
Things I do, I do them because
I like them.

1010
01:50:59,002 --> 01:51:00,839
Because I want to.

1011
01:52:38,597 --> 01:52:40,307
Tom?

1012
01:52:40,516 --> 01:52:42,768
Is that you?

1013
01:52:45,313 --> 01:52:47,481
My God!

1014
01:53:03,580 --> 01:53:05,998
Save me.

1015
01:53:09,961 --> 01:53:12,379
Save me.

1016
01:54:24,615 --> 01:54:29,911
Dear Mr. Welles. Thank you for writing
and telling me your real name..

1017
01:54:30,120 --> 01:54:32,998
who you really are
and what really happened.

1018
01:54:33,248 --> 01:54:35,543
I'm glad those men are dead.

1019
01:54:35,750 --> 01:54:38,753
But nothing will ever
fill the hole in my heart.

1020
01:54:38,962 --> 01:54:41,591
I will try to use the money
you sent for some good..

1021
01:54:41,756 --> 01:54:44,425
after I get some help for myself.

1022
01:54:44,551 --> 01:54:48,305
I hated you for telling me the truth..

1023
01:54:48,513 --> 01:54:52,975
but now I realize you and I are
the only people that ever really
cared about Mary Anne.

1024
01:54:53,184 --> 01:54:56,353
Yours truly, Janet Mathews.

1025
01:55:21,000 --> 01:55:28,800
