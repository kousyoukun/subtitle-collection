1
00:01:23,204 --> 00:01:24,449
Welcome to Miami.

2
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:28,122
While in the airport, please
observe Florida laws...

3
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:30,743
...which prohibit smoking
in the terminal.

4
00:01:31,004 --> 00:01:33,293
Thank you for not smoking.

5
00:02:51,670 --> 00:02:54,705
Your son-in-law dealt with the
dry cleaning franchise during the day.

6
00:02:54,922 --> 00:02:57,081
He saw that woman every night.

7
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,222
The specifics are in my report,
and information about the woman.

8
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:06,843
It's unpleasant, I know.

9
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:09,352
Discreet, isn't he?

10
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,605
What an imbecile!

11
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:15,108
I tried to warn my daughter,
but what can you do?

12
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:18,154
I worry about the children.

13
00:03:18,364 --> 00:03:20,653
My invoice is in the envelope,
if that's all.

14
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:23,400
Yes, Mr. Welles. Thank you.

15
00:03:23,994 --> 00:03:27,445
Senator, let me know if I can be
of further assistance to you.

16
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:29,329
I'll be in touch.

17
00:04:06,911 --> 00:04:08,286
Hello?

18
00:04:08,829 --> 00:04:10,288
You're home.

19
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:12,706
We're back here.

20
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:14,918
How did it go?

21
00:04:15,044 --> 00:04:16,123
I think very well.

22
00:04:16,378 --> 00:04:17,541
Good.

23
00:04:17,838 --> 00:04:19,747
Daddy's home, sweetie.

24
00:04:20,968 --> 00:04:23,045
How's the textbook business?

25
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:27,430
I got 10,000 words on
the Federal Theater project.

26
00:04:27,684 --> 00:04:31,018
It should be 4000 and the writer
doesn't want to change anything.

27
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:32,647
So, kind of bad.

28
00:04:34,066 --> 00:04:35,608
How was Miami?

29
00:04:35,859 --> 00:04:37,270
Fine. Lonesome.

30
00:04:37,528 --> 00:04:39,519
Couldn't pay me enough
to live down there.

31
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:41,398
Then why'd you go?

32
00:04:41,864 --> 00:04:45,031
Senator Michaelson
has powerful friends.

33
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,824
Hello, Cinderella.

34
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,619
Did you miss me?
I sure missed you.

35
00:04:55,878 --> 00:04:57,420
Oh, that's my girl.

36
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:59,997
She missed you.
I missed you.

37
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:02,789
You been smoking?

38
00:05:04,345 --> 00:05:06,006
Smoking? I'm not smoking.

39
00:05:07,266 --> 00:05:09,057
Come on, honey.

40
00:05:09,685 --> 00:05:11,227
You reek of it.

41
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:14,813
Amy, I've been sitting around
in bars following this guy.

42
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,938
Is this the first thing I get?

43
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,854
- You're accusing me?
- I'm not accusing you.

44
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,816
I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been all through that.

45
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,066
I'll make dinner.
Are you hungry?

46
00:05:27,326 --> 00:05:28,326
You're cooking?

47
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:34,908
I missed you.

48
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,582
I don't like it when you leave.

49
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,848
Should I go?

50
00:05:49,434 --> 00:05:50,927
I'm going to do it.

51
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,852
Come on.

52
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,949
What's all the trouble, Cinderella?

53
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,284
There, there.

54
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,128
I love you.

55
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:24,468
I love you.

56
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,183
Honey, phone!

57
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:50,530
Okay, I've got it!

58
00:06:50,788 --> 00:06:53,457
Sorry, I was just switching phones.

59
00:06:57,336 --> 00:06:59,792
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Longdale.

60
00:07:00,047 --> 00:07:02,205
How can I be of assistance to you?

61
00:07:07,637 --> 00:07:09,546
Four o'clock would be fine.

62
00:07:13,727 --> 00:07:15,636
I think I know where it is.

63
00:07:56,643 --> 00:07:59,216
Daniel Longdale.
We spoke on the phone.

64
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:00,479
Pleasure.

65
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:03,642
I'm the Christians' attorney and
an executor of the estate.

66
00:08:03,901 --> 00:08:04,980
This is Mrs. Christian.

67
00:08:05,236 --> 00:08:06,944
An honor to meet you.

68
00:08:07,238 --> 00:08:09,563
You come highly
recommended, Mr. Welles.

69
00:08:09,824 --> 00:08:13,867
I've spoken to associates of mine in
Harrisburg, Lancaster and Hershey.

70
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:15,654
You have influential friends.

71
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:18,825
I've been privileged to provide
services for people I admire.

72
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,497
You were praised for your discretion...

73
00:08:21,752 --> 00:08:25,086
...your strict adherence
to confidentiality.

74
00:08:25,339 --> 00:08:26,339
Thank you.

75
00:08:29,426 --> 00:08:32,511
As you know,
my husband passed away recently.

76
00:08:32,763 --> 00:08:34,970
My condolences, Mrs. Christian.

77
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:40,307
His passing has left me
with something of a dilemma.

78
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:42,852
I'll do whatever I can to help.

79
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:46,106
My husband's inner sanctum.

80
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:49,065
Not many people have been
inside this room.

81
00:08:51,574 --> 00:08:53,365
My father worked the Pittsburgh mill.

82
00:08:53,617 --> 00:08:55,824
Irving United Steel, I believe.

83
00:08:56,078 --> 00:08:58,486
But you attended Penn
on an academic scholarship.

84
00:08:58,706 --> 00:08:59,820
That's right.

85
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,578
Peers went into law and finance.
You chose surveillance.

86
00:09:02,793 --> 00:09:04,620
I decided it was the future.

87
00:09:05,088 --> 00:09:06,582
Your husband is a legend.

88
00:09:06,882 --> 00:09:07,882
Please.

89
00:09:08,091 --> 00:09:10,629
We were married 45 years.

90
00:09:10,886 --> 00:09:14,136
Four children, seven grandchildren.

91
00:09:14,598 --> 00:09:16,306
But his true passion lay...

92
00:09:16,516 --> 00:09:17,797
...in his work.

93
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,886
But he was always loyal.

94
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:23,139
I loved him deeply.

95
00:09:23,564 --> 00:09:25,023
I understand.

96
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:28,778
Daniel.

97
00:09:29,488 --> 00:09:33,153
My husband was the only one
with the combination to this safe.

98
00:09:33,366 --> 00:09:35,026
We hired somebody to open it.

99
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:37,491
I prevented anyone...

100
00:09:37,704 --> 00:09:39,911
...from seeing the contents.

101
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:43,208
I felt these were
my husband's private things.

102
00:09:43,502 --> 00:09:44,581
I didn't...

103
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,419
I didn't realize...

104
00:09:49,257 --> 00:09:51,583
Do you want to tell me what you found?

105
00:09:54,221 --> 00:09:56,213
Cash, stock certificates.

106
00:09:56,431 --> 00:10:00,724
Nothing out of the ordinary,
really, except that.

107
00:10:02,645 --> 00:10:03,759
It's a film...

108
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,104
...where a girl appears to be murdered.

109
00:10:08,317 --> 00:10:10,061
I'm not sure I understand.

110
00:10:10,319 --> 00:10:11,898
It's very realistic.

111
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:15,317
But how many people seem to be
realistically killed...

112
00:10:15,534 --> 00:10:17,445
...in movies and on TV every day?

113
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,948
It begins as a relatively
sleazy bit of pornography...

114
00:10:22,209 --> 00:10:25,210
...and rapidly turns
quite violent and bloody.

115
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:33,261
What you're talking about
is called a snuff film.

116
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:35,795
Snuff films are a kind of urban myth.

117
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:39,391
Sex industry folklore.
There's no such thing.

118
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:41,434
That's what I explained
to Mrs. Christian.

119
00:10:41,644 --> 00:10:44,135
This is probably
an S&M film of some sort.

120
00:10:44,397 --> 00:10:46,354
Simulated rape, simulated violence.

121
00:10:46,608 --> 00:10:48,849
It's hard to stomach,
but there are ways of doing it.

122
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,688
Fake blood, special effects.

123
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:54,107
Would you look at the film
and give us your opinion?

124
00:10:54,742 --> 00:10:55,904
All I want...

125
00:10:56,118 --> 00:11:00,412
...is to know that
this atrocity is false.

126
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,748
I want the proof.

127
00:12:57,990 --> 00:12:58,990
Well...

128
00:12:59,116 --> 00:13:02,236
...whoever made the film
was adept at authenticity.

129
00:13:02,495 --> 00:13:06,161
But I'm no expert.
Let the police make a determination.

130
00:13:06,374 --> 00:13:07,374
Out of the question.

131
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:10,211
That'd be so unnecessary
for any number of reasons...

132
00:13:10,462 --> 00:13:13,629
...not the least of which is
Mr. Christian's reputation.

133
00:13:15,217 --> 00:13:17,126
Find out who made this film...

134
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:19,177
...and establish whether it's real.

135
00:13:19,596 --> 00:13:20,971
You can name your price.

136
00:13:21,223 --> 00:13:25,007
You'll be provided with
whatever you need to buy information.

137
00:13:27,396 --> 00:13:29,305
Girl's all I've got to go on.

138
00:13:29,564 --> 00:13:31,355
I could treat it
like a missing persons case.

139
00:13:31,565 --> 00:13:32,565
Understood.

140
00:13:32,733 --> 00:13:33,733
Of course...

141
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:37,643
...we need to be assured
that you would not copy this film.

142
00:13:37,905 --> 00:13:39,696
You have my word on that.

143
00:13:40,157 --> 00:13:42,150
But I'll be dealing
directly with you...

144
00:13:42,368 --> 00:13:43,368
...and only you.

145
00:13:43,577 --> 00:13:45,497
Your relationship with
your attorney is your own.

146
00:13:45,621 --> 00:13:47,578
- No offense.
- None taken.

147
00:13:47,832 --> 00:13:51,084
I realize you've given this
careful consideration.

148
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,043
You could have destroyed it.

149
00:13:54,257 --> 00:13:56,878
Tell me the poor girl wasn't killed.

150
00:13:57,093 --> 00:13:58,421
Please?

151
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:00,505
Find her alive.

152
00:14:00,763 --> 00:14:02,922
I'll do the best I can, ma'am.

153
00:14:44,307 --> 00:14:45,307
Cleveland?

154
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,381
You just got home.

155
00:14:46,643 --> 00:14:49,347
I wish I could stay,
but this is the mortgage.

156
00:14:49,604 --> 00:14:51,063
It's Cindy's college money.

157
00:14:51,314 --> 00:14:53,556
If I do right by her,
with the circle she runs in...

158
00:14:53,816 --> 00:14:55,227
...this could be a big break.

159
00:14:55,485 --> 00:14:56,860
Do we need a break?

160
00:14:57,070 --> 00:14:59,062
Your father thinks we do.

161
00:15:01,784 --> 00:15:04,903
So, what was Mrs. Christian like?

162
00:15:05,162 --> 00:15:08,661
Like you'd expect, I guess.
I feel sorry for her.

163
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:09,947
It's a missing persons.

164
00:15:10,167 --> 00:15:12,835
I told her I'd give it
a couple of weeks. Three.

165
00:15:13,544 --> 00:15:16,582
It can't take longer than that.
It's an outside shot.

166
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,920
That's all I can tell you.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.

167
00:15:21,636 --> 00:15:23,463
It's always that way.

168
00:15:24,806 --> 00:15:28,139
- She's awake. I'll get her.
- I'll be up in a sec.

169
00:15:57,045 --> 00:15:59,085
- You're taking the gun?
- I won't need it.

170
00:15:59,298 --> 00:16:00,298
Don't take it.

171
00:16:00,383 --> 00:16:03,170
I won't wear it.
It's a precaution. Don't worry.

172
00:16:03,428 --> 00:16:06,049
Will you call me
when you get there, please?

173
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:25,910
I've been hired by a couple in
Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.

174
00:16:26,161 --> 00:16:29,410
A few days ago, they picked up
a girl hitchhiking off 81...

175
00:16:29,663 --> 00:16:31,739
...a runaway, about 18, maybe.

176
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:35,748
They buy her a meal.
The doctor tries to convince her...

177
00:16:36,003 --> 00:16:38,209
...that, at least,
she should call home.

178
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:41,002
Not surprisingly, the girl ate,
excused herself...

179
00:16:41,217 --> 00:16:42,841
...that was the last they saw of her.

180
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:46,261
We had a friend of mine
at the department work up a sketch.

181
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:48,721
They want to see
if I can I.D. this girl...

182
00:16:48,975 --> 00:16:51,098
...then pass along
a message to the parents...

183
00:16:51,353 --> 00:16:53,392
...letting them know
the kid's alive.

184
00:16:54,481 --> 00:16:56,390
You don't mind if I run a check?

185
00:16:56,608 --> 00:16:57,936
Go ahead.

186
00:16:58,902 --> 00:17:01,393
You want it, you got it.
Knock yourself out.

187
00:17:01,655 --> 00:17:05,023
Anywhere from 850,000 to 1,000,000
missing every year.

188
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:08,734
We got as much as we can on computer,
then it's the wet-thumb method.

189
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:11,278
Files are by state
and year of disappearance.

190
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:14,077
Children are separate.
No eating or smoking.

191
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,077
- There's coffee.
- Any good?

192
00:17:16,293 --> 00:17:17,408
Horrible.

193
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:19,627
It'll be your best friend
after a few days...

194
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,422
...if you last that long.

195
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,873
Good luck.

196
00:17:26,764 --> 00:17:28,093
Honey, it's me.

197
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,349
How are you?

198
00:17:29,434 --> 00:17:30,465
I'm good.

199
00:17:30,727 --> 00:17:31,727
Where are you?

200
00:17:31,936 --> 00:17:34,771
I'm still in Cleveland.
How's Cindy?

201
00:17:35,022 --> 00:17:38,059
She's sweet.
She's sleeping.

202
00:17:38,443 --> 00:17:41,775
- I'm missing you bigtime.
- Yeah, I miss you too.

203
00:17:42,654 --> 00:17:44,647
I'll call you tomorrow night.

204
00:17:45,365 --> 00:17:46,563
Good night.

205
00:17:46,783 --> 00:17:48,527
Good night, sweetheart.

206
00:18:32,705 --> 00:18:34,829
Hello, Mrs. Christian?
Tom Welles.

207
00:18:35,084 --> 00:18:36,282
Here's where we stand.

208
00:18:36,543 --> 00:18:39,959
I checked the film stock.
It's called Supralux 5-4-4.

209
00:18:40,214 --> 00:18:43,797
The company that made that
stock discontinued it in '92.

210
00:18:44,009 --> 00:18:46,381
So the film was made prior to that?

211
00:18:46,595 --> 00:18:49,430
Yes. I'm probably being
overly thorough with this...

212
00:18:49,682 --> 00:18:52,847
...but you might dig up your husband's
financial records...

213
00:18:53,101 --> 00:18:54,726
...about 6 or 7 years ago.

214
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:57,648
See if there's anything
out of the ordinary.

215
00:18:57,856 --> 00:19:01,475
This isn't a movie you drop off
at the one-hour photo.

216
00:19:01,694 --> 00:19:03,485
So you think it's one of a kind.

217
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:07,153
The film is what we've got.
There's no negative.

218
00:19:07,783 --> 00:19:10,532
Unlike video, it's not
designed to be duplicated.

219
00:19:10,783 --> 00:19:12,859
Whatever this is, I have a feeling...

220
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:16,036
...there aren't many copies
floating around, if any.

221
00:19:16,247 --> 00:19:19,912
I'm looking for a girl
we're not even sure is missing.

222
00:19:20,167 --> 00:19:22,872
With this happening 6 or 7 years ago...

223
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:27,339
...finding the guys who made this film
is going to be very difficult.

224
00:19:27,591 --> 00:19:30,627
I know you can do it.
You're doing a wonderful job.

225
00:19:30,886 --> 00:19:34,005
Please tell me you'll
continue the investigation.

226
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:36,303
I will. I'll keep trying for you.

227
00:19:36,516 --> 00:19:39,055
You can count on me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.

228
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:44,774
We can't come to the phone now,
so please leave a message at the beep.

229
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:46,058
Honey, it's me.

230
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:49,279
I'm sorry I forgot to call last night.

231
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:51,156
I won't forget tonight.

232
00:19:51,408 --> 00:19:54,243
I've been gone a long time.
I hope I'll be home soon.

233
00:19:54,494 --> 00:19:57,330
I love you, and I miss you.
We'll talk tonight.

234
00:21:19,622 --> 00:21:21,580
You looking for Janet?

235
00:21:28,173 --> 00:21:30,130
Hello, Mrs. Mathews?

236
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:32,963
I'm Thomas Hart.
I'm a licensed investigator.

237
00:21:33,261 --> 00:21:36,712
I've been hired by the U.S. Resource
Center, Missing Persons...

238
00:21:36,973 --> 00:21:38,551
...as part of an internal audit.

239
00:21:38,808 --> 00:21:43,933
I'd like you to answer questions
about your daughter, Mary Anne.

240
00:21:44,189 --> 00:21:48,352
I spoke to your FBI contact
yesterday, Agent...

241
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,104
Neil. Neil Cole?

242
00:21:50,361 --> 00:21:54,655
Yes, Agent Cole. He told me
he'd call and let you know to expect me.

243
00:21:55,408 --> 00:21:57,116
He didn't call?

244
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,375
Is this you?

245
00:22:06,463 --> 00:22:08,502
You look about five years old.

246
00:22:08,965 --> 00:22:09,965
A little older.

247
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:11,290
Sweet.

248
00:22:14,346 --> 00:22:19,471
It's important that you don't
let this raise your expectations.

249
00:22:19,976 --> 00:22:23,227
It's not going to effect
any ongoing efforts.

250
00:22:23,979 --> 00:22:25,972
All I'm saying is, please know...

251
00:22:26,232 --> 00:22:28,983
...I'm not here to create
any false hope.

252
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:35,984
We fought all the time,
Mary Anne and me...

253
00:22:36,243 --> 00:22:37,405
...and her stepdad.

254
00:22:37,661 --> 00:22:39,321
She hated him...

255
00:22:39,579 --> 00:22:41,655
...because he wasn't her real dad.

256
00:22:42,332 --> 00:22:45,333
Trouble here, trouble at school.

257
00:22:45,585 --> 00:22:46,700
Trouble.

258
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:50,830
Didn't like rules.
Takes after me, I guess.

259
00:22:51,091 --> 00:22:53,333
I had to learn the hard way.

260
00:22:54,928 --> 00:22:56,672
Can I speak to your husband?

261
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,930
Her stepfather?

262
00:22:58,098 --> 00:22:59,129
Dave?

263
00:22:59,390 --> 00:23:00,718
Gone.

264
00:23:01,183 --> 00:23:03,556
Two years after Mary Anne left.

265
00:23:03,936 --> 00:23:06,972
All the time, she resented him.

266
00:23:07,230 --> 00:23:11,014
I lost her because of him,
and then I lost him.

267
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:13,768
I'm the only one still here.

268
00:23:15,197 --> 00:23:17,024
Did Mary have a boyfriend?

269
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:19,905
She was sneaking out with someone.

270
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:22,244
She wouldn't tell me who.

271
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:25,873
Coming home with hickeys,
lying all the time.

272
00:23:27,586 --> 00:23:31,002
I am sorry to bring this up,
but in these circumstances...

273
00:23:31,256 --> 00:23:32,881
...with the stepfather...

274
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:36,252
...were there any indications
of any sort of abuse?

275
00:23:36,594 --> 00:23:39,511
There was nothing like that.
The police and FBI asked.

276
00:23:39,764 --> 00:23:43,014
There wasn't anything like that.
She'd have told me.

277
00:23:43,226 --> 00:23:45,930
I apologize. I had to ask.

278
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:51,475
Those are for her birthday.
One for every year she missed.

279
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:54,403
They'll be waiting for her
when she comes back.

280
00:23:56,447 --> 00:23:58,404
It's because I slapped her.

281
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:01,275
I know.

282
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,375
We was fighting about Dave,
and she was just pushing my buttons.

283
00:24:07,627 --> 00:24:09,002
And I slapped her.

284
00:24:10,963 --> 00:24:12,161
Jesus!

285
00:24:13,590 --> 00:24:14,871
Next day, she was gone.

286
00:24:16,176 --> 00:24:18,963
When kids run, they
almost always leave a note.

287
00:24:19,221 --> 00:24:20,336
It's guilt, usually.

288
00:24:20,597 --> 00:24:22,305
There wasn't one.

289
00:24:22,599 --> 00:24:23,714
Police looked.

290
00:24:23,976 --> 00:24:26,597
An abduction's one thing,
a runaway's another.

291
00:24:26,854 --> 00:24:30,140
Sometimes it's not the priority
for the police it should be.

292
00:24:30,441 --> 00:24:34,605
There wasn't anything.
Don't you think I wish there was?

293
00:24:34,946 --> 00:24:37,402
You're probably right,
but would you let me look?

294
00:24:39,284 --> 00:24:40,861
You tell me...

295
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:43,326
...not to get my hopes up...

296
00:24:43,831 --> 00:24:46,831
...not to raise my expectations.

297
00:24:50,879 --> 00:24:52,207
Go ahead.

298
00:24:52,755 --> 00:24:54,166
I need a drink.

299
00:24:55,508 --> 00:24:56,837
Thank you.

300
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:47,029
Dear Mom, if you're reading this...

301
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:50,325
...it means I called you
from Hollywood, California.

302
00:26:50,584 --> 00:26:54,629
I left my diary behind because
I want you to see why I'm leaving.

303
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:56,582
It's not because you hit me.

304
00:26:56,841 --> 00:26:59,925
I hid this so Dave the dickhead
wouldn't find it.

305
00:27:00,219 --> 00:27:02,258
Warren Anderson and me are in love.

306
00:27:02,512 --> 00:27:04,754
I'm going to start a new life with him.

307
00:27:04,973 --> 00:27:06,847
His dad owns that garage in town.

308
00:27:07,392 --> 00:27:10,013
But Warren has even bigger plans.

309
00:27:10,269 --> 00:27:12,226
He'll become a star in action movies.

310
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,231
He says I'm prettier
than a lot of girls in movies.

311
00:27:15,483 --> 00:27:16,763
I could be a star too.

312
00:27:17,193 --> 00:27:18,604
You want a drink?

313
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:20,652
When we cruise into Hollywood...

314
00:27:20,905 --> 00:27:25,483
...I'll have fiery eyes that everyone
will notice, because I am in love.

315
00:27:27,787 --> 00:27:30,538
You were right.
I didn't find anything.

316
00:27:31,582 --> 00:27:32,745
Fixed you a drink.

317
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,372
Thanks, no.
I've got work to do.

318
00:27:35,628 --> 00:27:37,538
I'll stop by tomorrow night.

319
00:27:38,507 --> 00:27:41,045
We'll probably be married
by the time you read this.

320
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:44,799
Don't come looking for me,
because I'm not coming back.

321
00:27:45,054 --> 00:27:48,755
Maybe someday you'll see me
on TV or in magazines.

322
00:27:49,016 --> 00:27:52,183
Don't worry about me.
Love, Mary Anne.

323
00:27:52,562 --> 00:27:54,269
Mr. Anderson?

324
00:27:56,524 --> 00:27:57,524
Who's asking?

325
00:27:57,567 --> 00:28:00,402
Tom Hart.
Excuse me not shaking hands.

326
00:28:01,322 --> 00:28:04,572
I'm looking for your son.
You've got a son named Warren, right?

327
00:28:04,826 --> 00:28:06,024
Sure.

328
00:28:07,036 --> 00:28:09,658
What's it about? You a cop?

329
00:28:09,873 --> 00:28:10,987
No, sir.

330
00:28:11,207 --> 00:28:14,623
Just a friend from a while back.
Owe him some money.

331
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:17,163
You owe him money?

332
00:28:17,422 --> 00:28:18,702
That's a new one.

333
00:28:20,717 --> 00:28:23,172
You can leave it
right here if you want.

334
00:28:23,887 --> 00:28:26,674
If it's all the same,
I'd like to send it to him.

335
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:28,599
California, right?

336
00:28:30,351 --> 00:28:31,976
California?

337
00:28:33,271 --> 00:28:36,521
Son, you know where
the Fayetteville lockup is?

338
00:28:37,025 --> 00:28:39,017
That's where Warren is.

339
00:28:39,277 --> 00:28:41,733
Doing eight months on a B and E.

340
00:28:45,074 --> 00:28:46,237
Thank you.

341
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:51,695
Yeah, man, I knew her.

342
00:28:52,957 --> 00:28:55,626
Dumped that bitch right
before I moved to L.A.

343
00:28:56,043 --> 00:28:58,913
She shows up knocking at my door
like a fucking stalker.

344
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:01,753
Told that bitch she could go to hell.

345
00:29:03,802 --> 00:29:04,964
Where'd she go?

346
00:29:07,013 --> 00:29:08,555
Hell, maybe.

347
00:29:09,557 --> 00:29:12,345
I don't know and
I don't give a fuck, either.

348
00:29:14,021 --> 00:29:16,939
She said she might work
at a titty bar or something.

349
00:29:17,566 --> 00:29:20,104
Ask me, her tits
weren't all that great.

350
00:29:21,779 --> 00:29:23,238
Did you hear from her again?

351
00:29:25,574 --> 00:29:28,611
Because I fucked her
doesn't mean I wanted her there.

352
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:32,571
She came to Hollywood to be
a big fucking movie star.

353
00:29:33,164 --> 00:29:35,738
And so did I.
Check me out now.

354
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:43,215
Why don't you pass me
one of them smokes?

355
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:51,349
I don't smoke.

356
00:29:55,771 --> 00:29:57,230
How you doing?

357
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:58,481
I'm okay.

358
00:29:58,607 --> 00:30:00,566
You don't sound okay.

359
00:30:00,944 --> 00:30:02,652
It's not easy.

360
00:30:02,863 --> 00:30:04,143
Why? What's going on?

361
00:30:04,531 --> 00:30:07,151
It's just tougher than
I thought it would be.

362
00:30:07,366 --> 00:30:08,695
Is it getting to you?

363
00:30:08,951 --> 00:30:10,529
I got a lead I can't drop.

364
00:30:10,786 --> 00:30:12,743
I'm almost done.
I miss you.

365
00:30:13,164 --> 00:30:14,574
I miss you too.
I love you.

366
00:30:14,832 --> 00:30:16,374
Give Cindy a kiss for me.

367
00:30:16,625 --> 00:30:19,792
Wait, I think she wants to say bye.
Say bye to Daddy.

368
00:30:20,004 --> 00:30:22,673
Hi, sweetie. Hi, honey.

369
00:30:23,215 --> 00:30:24,296
Hi, Cinderella.

370
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:26,793
She's touching the phone.

371
00:30:27,804 --> 00:30:30,260
You should see her face at your voice.

372
00:30:30,933 --> 00:30:31,933
I love you.

373
00:30:32,101 --> 00:30:34,639
I love you too. Bye.

374
00:30:37,148 --> 00:30:39,141
I was just making dinner.

375
00:30:39,442 --> 00:30:42,358
I've made enough for two,
as it happens.

376
00:30:42,611 --> 00:30:44,520
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

377
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:48,398
I wanted to let you know
I spoke to my people at the agency.

378
00:30:48,659 --> 00:30:51,659
I told them to keep
Mary Anne's case active.

379
00:30:52,829 --> 00:30:54,240
Well...

380
00:30:54,998 --> 00:30:58,248
...stay for a drink, at least.

381
00:31:02,169 --> 00:31:03,829
You sure you're not hungry?

382
00:31:04,046 --> 00:31:06,917
It'd be nice to have a meal
without the TV on for once.

383
00:31:07,883 --> 00:31:09,461
I have a long drive ahead of me.

384
00:31:09,718 --> 00:31:12,589
It's one of the most
depressing things. Eating alone.

385
00:31:12,805 --> 00:31:16,305
I don't know why. You think
I'd be used to it by now.

386
00:31:27,361 --> 00:31:28,392
Mrs. Mathews?

387
00:31:29,655 --> 00:31:30,935
Janet.

388
00:31:32,366 --> 00:31:33,646
Do you ever consider...

389
00:31:34,243 --> 00:31:37,031
Do you realize that
Mary may never come back?

390
00:31:38,665 --> 00:31:40,788
I think about it every day.

391
00:31:41,459 --> 00:31:43,002
Every time the phone rings...

392
00:31:43,253 --> 00:31:46,586
...every time, I still think it's her.

393
00:31:47,299 --> 00:31:49,587
She's all I think about.

394
00:31:51,303 --> 00:31:52,962
Can you tell me...

395
00:31:53,888 --> 00:31:57,553
...if you had to make a choice,
if you were forced to choose...

396
00:31:58,144 --> 00:32:01,513
...between imagining her
out there somewhere...

397
00:32:01,772 --> 00:32:04,892
...living a good life, being happy...

398
00:32:06,319 --> 00:32:08,027
...but you don't know...

399
00:32:08,738 --> 00:32:10,529
...you never find out...

400
00:32:12,033 --> 00:32:14,109
...or the worst being true...

401
00:32:14,911 --> 00:32:16,535
...her being gone...

402
00:32:17,872 --> 00:32:19,414
...but you know.

403
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:22,082
You finally know...

404
00:32:23,503 --> 00:32:25,246
...what's happened to her.

405
00:32:26,797 --> 00:32:28,540
What would I choose?

406
00:32:29,841 --> 00:32:30,841
Yes.

407
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:36,839
I would choose to know.

408
00:32:39,518 --> 00:32:41,511
I need to know.

409
00:32:48,237 --> 00:32:51,321
Excuse me, I have to use your restroom.

410
00:33:45,251 --> 00:33:46,876
You're leaving.

411
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:54,422
I'll call you if I find anything out.

412
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:38,458
How you doing?

413
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:40,679
Big date tonight?

414
00:36:41,722 --> 00:36:43,300
Yeah, guess so.

415
00:36:43,558 --> 00:36:46,262
Could I interest you
in a battery-operated vagina?

416
00:36:47,103 --> 00:36:49,012
It's tempting, but no thanks.

417
00:36:49,397 --> 00:36:52,813
I'd hate to see you in one
of those everyday situations...

418
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:56,187
...that calls for it
and you don't have one.

419
00:36:56,404 --> 00:36:57,898
I'll risk it.

420
00:36:59,448 --> 00:37:02,402
All right, your total
is $74.58, please.

421
00:37:05,914 --> 00:37:07,373
A hundred.

422
00:37:12,545 --> 00:37:16,329
Total's $25 and some change.

423
00:37:19,719 --> 00:37:22,424
Thank you for shopping
at Adult Bookstore.

424
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,218
And have yourself a fabulous day.

425
00:37:25,558 --> 00:37:27,052
What are you reading?

426
00:37:29,730 --> 00:37:31,521
Catchy title.
What are you really reading?

427
00:37:31,732 --> 00:37:34,982
Hard to believe it's got
any parts worth highlighting.

428
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:39,946
Capote.

429
00:37:41,909 --> 00:37:43,071
You know how it is.

430
00:37:43,702 --> 00:37:47,072
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
in front of your fellow perverts.

431
00:37:48,332 --> 00:37:51,498
I might get drummed out
of the pornographers' union.

432
00:37:51,752 --> 00:37:53,377
Where would I be then?

433
00:37:56,299 --> 00:37:57,924
Have a good day.

434
00:38:25,661 --> 00:38:26,859
How are you?

435
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:28,615
Hey, honey.

436
00:38:28,997 --> 00:38:30,825
- How you doing?
- I'm a little beat.

437
00:38:31,042 --> 00:38:32,042
How's Cindy?

438
00:38:32,127 --> 00:38:34,000
She's sweet. She misses you.

439
00:38:34,212 --> 00:38:35,837
How's it going?

440
00:38:36,464 --> 00:38:39,714
The way things are going,
I'm thinking about coming home.

441
00:38:40,135 --> 00:38:41,135
Really?

442
00:38:42,763 --> 00:38:44,174
Honey, wait.

443
00:38:46,892 --> 00:38:48,517
Can I call you back?

444
00:38:49,395 --> 00:38:52,016
I'll call you right back, I promise.
Bye, honey.

445
00:39:34,688 --> 00:39:36,266
Mrs. Christian, there were three men.

446
00:39:36,523 --> 00:39:38,979
Not just the cameraman
and the masked man.

447
00:39:39,652 --> 00:39:42,522
I caught a glimpse of a third man.
He was watching.

448
00:39:44,323 --> 00:39:46,944
I'll get a clearer image
through computer enhancement.

449
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:50,404
But this probably happened
6 years ago, so it's not...

450
00:39:50,704 --> 00:39:52,498
All right, I'll keep trying.

451
00:39:52,750 --> 00:39:55,537
Thank you, I appreciate
your support. Goodbye.

452
00:39:56,671 --> 00:39:59,838
What we have here is
137 billable man-hours...

453
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:02,630
...a hundred-plus thousand
dollars machine...

454
00:40:02,886 --> 00:40:07,513
...and the result is an enhancement
of the back of some guy's head.

455
00:40:09,475 --> 00:40:10,886
Want it framed?

456
00:40:12,562 --> 00:40:14,720
There you go. Have a nice day.

457
00:40:16,649 --> 00:40:19,769
It's like a gas station,
you pay before you pump.

458
00:40:20,736 --> 00:40:22,279
Remember me?

459
00:40:24,907 --> 00:40:27,861
Came back for the battery-operated
vagina after all.

460
00:40:28,536 --> 00:40:30,861
I need information.
Maybe you can help.

461
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:34,164
Thomas Welles. Nice picture.

462
00:40:34,667 --> 00:40:37,917
What sort of information?
I got all different kinds.

463
00:40:38,129 --> 00:40:39,243
The kind I'll pay for.

464
00:40:40,256 --> 00:40:42,665
I don't know what you're looking for...

465
00:40:42,926 --> 00:40:45,048
...so we're clear from the start,
I'm straight.

466
00:40:45,303 --> 00:40:46,417
Congratulations.

467
00:40:46,679 --> 00:40:47,794
Thank you.

468
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:49,055
Zip it!

469
00:40:49,223 --> 00:40:50,504
I can hook you up.

470
00:40:50,766 --> 00:40:52,510
Name the vice, I name the price.

471
00:40:53,186 --> 00:40:56,389
- How long you been working here?
- Almost two years.

472
00:40:56,647 --> 00:40:58,770
What's your name,
if you don't mind me asking?

473
00:40:59,025 --> 00:41:00,567
Max.

474
00:41:01,903 --> 00:41:02,903
Here's the deal.

475
00:41:03,113 --> 00:41:05,865
This thing has to do
with underground pornography.

476
00:41:06,116 --> 00:41:08,868
Stuff that's sold
under the counter, illegally.

477
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,278
There's not much illegal out there.

478
00:41:11,538 --> 00:41:15,156
Whatever there is, I want to know.
I want a good look.

479
00:41:15,417 --> 00:41:19,249
If you've got that kind of
connection, great. If not, speak now.

480
00:41:19,630 --> 00:41:21,004
You're not a cop, are you?

481
00:41:21,255 --> 00:41:23,462
If I ask and you are,
you got to tell me.

482
00:41:23,716 --> 00:41:25,259
I'm not a cop.

483
00:41:26,136 --> 00:41:27,334
A private detective?

484
00:41:27,596 --> 00:41:29,055
Like Shaft?

485
00:41:29,932 --> 00:41:32,601
You ever seen Private Dicks?
I got it on sale.

486
00:41:32,851 --> 00:41:34,476
How much you make in there?

487
00:41:37,147 --> 00:41:40,433
Around 400 bucks a week, off the books.

488
00:41:40,609 --> 00:41:42,934
Let's pretend I live
in the same fantasy world...

489
00:41:43,195 --> 00:41:45,271
...where you make $400
a week in that dump.

490
00:41:45,531 --> 00:41:47,737
I'll give you 500 for a few days.

491
00:41:47,991 --> 00:41:49,236
Six sounds good, Pops.

492
00:41:49,493 --> 00:41:50,739
Five.

493
00:41:52,122 --> 00:41:53,865
Here's my number.

494
00:41:58,001 --> 00:41:59,709
When can you start?

495
00:42:00,129 --> 00:42:02,833
Well, tomorrow night I get off late.

496
00:42:03,841 --> 00:42:04,841
Tomorrow.

497
00:42:05,092 --> 00:42:06,092
All right.

498
00:42:06,218 --> 00:42:09,173
And don't call me Pops.

499
00:42:09,806 --> 00:42:13,009
Of course not. I wouldn't
want to hurt your feelings.

500
00:42:15,479 --> 00:42:17,353
I don't know what your scene is.

501
00:42:17,606 --> 00:42:19,433
You may like porn
as much as the next guy.

502
00:42:19,692 --> 00:42:23,440
You don't look like your average
sleaze. More like your average cop.

503
00:42:23,654 --> 00:42:27,189
So when you ask people
about fucking illegal stuff...

504
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,407
...it has a certain patina to it.

505
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:30,618
Patina.

506
00:42:30,745 --> 00:42:32,783
It's a Truman Capote word. Hello?

507
00:42:33,038 --> 00:42:36,738
If someone never sold a snuff film,
they shouldn't care what I ask.

508
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,957
If they have, they should be nervous.

509
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,832
Whoever acts insulted,
knock on their door.

510
00:42:42,088 --> 00:42:46,003
Look, Pops, it's not too late
to change your mind about all this.

511
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:49,043
There's things you'll see
that you can't unsee.

512
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:52,635
- They stay in your head.
- How do you know what I've seen?

513
00:42:52,847 --> 00:42:56,097
Okay, fine.
But everybody's got their limit.

514
00:42:56,351 --> 00:42:59,850
I've been here six fucking years
trying to get my music together.

515
00:43:00,104 --> 00:43:03,639
So I start part-time
where I work, to make ends meet.

516
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:07,315
And boom, a couple years go by,
and here I am.

517
00:43:07,569 --> 00:43:11,234
I'm just saying, before you know it,
you're in it. Deep in it.

518
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:13,114
Don't worry about me.

519
00:43:13,367 --> 00:43:14,367
But thank you.

520
00:43:14,534 --> 00:43:16,242
You're welcome.

521
00:43:16,745 --> 00:43:19,865
Pops, you dance with the devil,
the devil don't change.

522
00:43:20,207 --> 00:43:21,998
Devil changes you.

523
00:43:22,376 --> 00:43:23,621
Some of your lyrics?

524
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:24,835
That's cute.

525
00:43:36,058 --> 00:43:38,134
This place has been around
about 3 years...

526
00:43:38,394 --> 00:43:40,766
...but they keep moving it
house to house.

527
00:43:57,204 --> 00:43:59,113
This is the tip of the iceberg.

528
00:43:59,373 --> 00:44:02,208
Lots of Mexican S&M,
lots of Asian bondage...

529
00:44:02,459 --> 00:44:05,626
...all kinds of bestiality,
if you're into that.

530
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:08,127
Don't touch nothing.
You want something, tell Friendly.

531
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,340
Ask him.

532
00:44:21,896 --> 00:44:23,094
Don't do that!

533
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:24,814
All right! It's cool!

534
00:44:26,692 --> 00:44:27,807
All right? Okay.

535
00:44:36,119 --> 00:44:38,159
Come on, let's go. All right!

536
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:45,204
Are you affiliated with law enforcement?

537
00:44:45,462 --> 00:44:46,742
Fuck you, Larry.

538
00:44:47,005 --> 00:44:51,003
Are you a law enforcement agent,
or affiliated with law enforcement?

539
00:44:51,259 --> 00:44:52,457
Fuck you, Larry.

540
00:44:52,719 --> 00:44:54,592
You're getting cool there, Welles.

541
00:44:54,845 --> 00:44:58,594
You got your porn zombies here.
Junkies for the hard stuff.

542
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:01,056
But these sales won't last much longer.

543
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,434
It's risky,
and everything's on the Net.

544
00:45:03,688 --> 00:45:05,930
Chicken hawks swapping photos
with their modems.

545
00:45:06,191 --> 00:45:09,774
Then there's classified ads
with hidden codes, secret couriers...

546
00:45:10,028 --> 00:45:12,021
...wires through dummy corporations.

547
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:15,447
If something's illegal, the buyers
are as far away as they can get.

548
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,701
Nobody knows what nobody knows,
you know what I mean?

549
00:45:18,912 --> 00:45:20,371
How's it going, Samuel?

550
00:45:25,210 --> 00:45:26,788
I'll say hi to her.

551
00:45:27,379 --> 00:45:29,169
How are you? I love that.

552
00:45:29,421 --> 00:45:31,995
It's the Michael Jackson look,
with the zippers.

553
00:46:04,209 --> 00:46:05,750
What are these?

554
00:46:06,711 --> 00:46:08,502
Extreme bondage.

555
00:46:08,880 --> 00:46:10,422
Rape films.

556
00:46:11,340 --> 00:46:13,000
Sick shit.

557
00:46:13,426 --> 00:46:16,095
Buy five, get one for free.

558
00:46:17,889 --> 00:46:19,383
Anything harder?

559
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:21,882
There's nothing harder.

560
00:46:22,685 --> 00:46:23,716
Snuff?

561
00:46:26,773 --> 00:46:29,228
There's no such thing as snuff.

562
00:46:29,693 --> 00:46:31,852
What you see is what I got, mister.

563
00:46:32,071 --> 00:46:34,147
Do you know where I can get some?

564
00:46:34,365 --> 00:46:36,108
Fuck off.

565
00:47:24,289 --> 00:47:25,487
There she is.

566
00:47:25,748 --> 00:47:28,785
There she is.
It's Double Slap Dorothy.

567
00:47:29,043 --> 00:47:31,369
That chick could be a baseball player.

568
00:47:31,587 --> 00:47:33,295
The swing on her is unreal.

569
00:47:34,507 --> 00:47:38,090
Some of these S&M and bondage films
you'll see straddle the line.

570
00:47:38,344 --> 00:47:39,969
Foot fetish, orgies, shit films...

571
00:47:40,221 --> 00:47:42,843
...hermaphrodites, mutilation.
It's harder than hard-core.

572
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:44,262
But mostly legal.

573
00:47:44,517 --> 00:47:45,517
Stick.

574
00:47:45,603 --> 00:47:46,931
One guy sees it and pukes.

575
00:47:47,187 --> 00:47:50,141
Another guy sees it
and he falls in love.

576
00:47:51,107 --> 00:47:54,357
This is the guy I told you about.
Got the tapes?

577
00:47:55,612 --> 00:47:56,612
$1000.

578
00:47:56,697 --> 00:47:58,903
- 1200 for the two.
- You told Max 1000.

579
00:47:59,158 --> 00:48:03,487
I know. This is more fun. I raise
the price, you get pissed off.

580
00:48:03,746 --> 00:48:06,118
- I thought we had a relationship.
- Is it real?

581
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:09,037
Sickest shit you'll ever see.

582
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:15,132
Is that real?

583
00:48:16,509 --> 00:48:18,668
That sure as shit looks real.

584
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:27,976
She's not breathing.

585
00:48:37,196 --> 00:48:38,856
Who makes these films?

586
00:48:39,114 --> 00:48:40,526
I don't know.

587
00:48:40,867 --> 00:48:42,860
Looks like the Philippines.

588
00:48:47,833 --> 00:48:50,406
Yeah, definitely the Philippines.

589
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,014
Wait a minute.
That's the same girl.

590
00:49:16,277 --> 00:49:17,735
Isn't that the same girl?

591
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:19,185
Look.

592
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,021
It is the same.

593
00:49:22,242 --> 00:49:23,405
They're fakes.

594
00:49:25,955 --> 00:49:27,615
That's great.

595
00:49:29,250 --> 00:49:32,453
Snuff 2.: The Resurrection.

596
00:49:32,712 --> 00:49:34,206
Oh, boy.

597
00:49:34,464 --> 00:49:36,955
Well, what do you expect for 1200?

598
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:42,167
You want a beer or something?
I could use anything.

599
00:49:43,931 --> 00:49:47,135
But I'm sorry, man.
I told you snuff was bogus.

600
00:49:47,393 --> 00:49:50,145
I just wish I would have
gotten you a receipt.

601
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:51,933
"Hard Spank."

602
00:49:52,607 --> 00:49:54,564
"Max California."

603
00:49:54,817 --> 00:49:56,726
That's my old band.

604
00:49:57,028 --> 00:49:58,273
We broke up.

605
00:49:58,488 --> 00:49:59,602
When?

606
00:49:59,947 --> 00:50:01,774
Maybe about a year ago.

607
00:50:03,117 --> 00:50:05,442
I don't mean any offense...

608
00:50:05,703 --> 00:50:08,242
...but what are you doing
mixed up in all this?

609
00:50:09,041 --> 00:50:11,911
I'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.

610
00:50:12,127 --> 00:50:14,748
You strike me as being smart enough
to do something else.

611
00:50:15,630 --> 00:50:16,910
Thanks.

612
00:50:17,173 --> 00:50:19,581
I wish you owned a record label.

613
00:50:20,385 --> 00:50:22,958
Look, it beats pumping gas.

614
00:50:23,596 --> 00:50:26,087
I don't buy it.
I don't endorse it.

615
00:50:26,808 --> 00:50:28,053
I just point the way.

616
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,019
You said it gets to you.

617
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:32,688
Well, hell, yeah.

618
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,431
Parade of losers I see every day?

619
00:50:35,693 --> 00:50:37,400
What choices have I got?

620
00:50:37,611 --> 00:50:41,823
The music industry is not exactly
beating down my door.

621
00:50:42,865 --> 00:50:45,700
And what about you, Tom Welles?

622
00:50:46,119 --> 00:50:49,487
You got a ring on your finger.
You got kids?

623
00:50:49,871 --> 00:50:51,153
A daughter.

624
00:50:52,917 --> 00:50:55,123
So you got a wife and a daughter...

625
00:50:55,378 --> 00:50:57,205
...and a nice little yellow house...

626
00:50:57,422 --> 00:50:59,498
...and a dog named Shep.

627
00:50:59,841 --> 00:51:02,166
What the hell are you doing here?

628
00:51:05,013 --> 00:51:06,507
Good question.

629
00:51:09,350 --> 00:51:11,224
Do you get turned on
at places like tonight?

630
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:14,433
No, I am not.

631
00:51:14,647 --> 00:51:16,972
You don't exactly
get turned off, either.

632
00:51:19,527 --> 00:51:21,436
Devil's changing you already.

633
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:23,571
Good night, Max.

634
00:52:02,571 --> 00:52:06,189
This gentleman was asking if anyone
recognizes this girl.

635
00:52:08,202 --> 00:52:09,364
Yes.

636
00:52:09,620 --> 00:52:10,995
I remember Mary.

637
00:52:11,247 --> 00:52:13,073
Mary Anne Mathews?

638
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:18,285
She lived here for only about a month,
if I recall correctly.

639
00:52:18,547 --> 00:52:22,414
She didn't return one night.
Do you know what happened to her?

640
00:52:22,676 --> 00:52:25,630
Not yet, but I'm looking
into it for her parents.

641
00:52:25,887 --> 00:52:28,592
Could you get
that flowered one down for me?

642
00:52:29,224 --> 00:52:30,552
That's her suitcase.

643
00:52:30,809 --> 00:52:34,012
I'd forgotten about it
till you showed me her picture.

644
00:52:34,896 --> 00:52:38,763
I suppose I always hoped she'd be back.

645
00:52:39,024 --> 00:52:40,851
She seemed so lost.

646
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:44,858
After a time, all I could do was pray
she'd moved on to better things.

647
00:52:45,114 --> 00:52:47,106
Can you get this suitcase
to her people?

648
00:52:47,324 --> 00:52:48,569
If it's appropriate.

649
00:52:48,784 --> 00:52:50,243
Yes, of course. Thank you.

650
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,533
Starlight, star bright

651
00:53:37,751 --> 00:53:39,542
First star I've seen tonight

652
00:53:39,795 --> 00:53:41,954
I wish I may, wish I might

653
00:53:42,215 --> 00:53:44,503
Have this wish I wish tonight

654
00:53:49,514 --> 00:53:52,930
The number you have reached
is no longer in service.

655
00:53:54,852 --> 00:53:57,522
Hello, Hollywood Wax Museum.
Can I help you?

656
00:53:58,856 --> 00:54:01,264
This is operator 149.
What city and listing?

657
00:54:01,526 --> 00:54:03,602
I don't know. Hollywood.

658
00:54:04,029 --> 00:54:06,983
A listing for Celebrity Films,
and I need an address.

659
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:09,648
Please hold for
phone number and address.

660
00:54:33,976 --> 00:54:36,893
- I was here first.
- Sorry, I'll just be a couple minutes.

661
00:54:39,937 --> 00:54:40,937
Eddie Poole?

662
00:54:41,897 --> 00:54:43,356
A process server?

663
00:54:43,607 --> 00:54:47,901
No, I've been inquiring around if,
by any chance, you've seen this girl.

664
00:54:48,487 --> 00:54:49,487
You a cop?

665
00:54:49,780 --> 00:54:51,405
I'm a member of her family.

666
00:54:51,615 --> 00:54:53,691
You know how much pussy
comes through here?

667
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,734
Please, if you'd just take a look.
It would've been a few years.

668
00:55:06,963 --> 00:55:09,288
Her name is Mary Anne Mathews.

669
00:55:11,968 --> 00:55:13,380
Never seen her.

670
00:55:14,806 --> 00:55:15,969
You sure?

671
00:55:16,933 --> 00:55:19,425
I just looked at the picture, didn't I?

672
00:55:19,978 --> 00:55:22,137
Come on. I got
a lot of shit to do.

673
00:55:26,193 --> 00:55:27,391
Who's next?

674
00:55:59,894 --> 00:56:01,305
This'll be fine.

675
00:56:42,188 --> 00:56:44,144
What kind of shit are you peddling?

676
00:56:44,397 --> 00:56:46,555
My tapes sell.
People eat the shit up.

677
00:56:46,816 --> 00:56:49,568
I had three jerks
returning your tapes last month.

678
00:56:49,819 --> 00:56:53,022
You know how bad it has to be
for a jackass to come back...

679
00:56:53,281 --> 00:56:56,235
...with a receipt
and try to fucking return it?

680
00:56:56,493 --> 00:56:57,493
How bad?

681
00:56:57,744 --> 00:57:01,658
Get together some upscale product
where the girls still have teeth.

682
00:57:02,540 --> 00:57:05,031
Till then, fuck you!

683
00:57:05,460 --> 00:57:07,002
Does your mother have any teeth?

684
00:57:07,253 --> 00:57:09,495
If she does, send her down, you fuck.

685
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:16,113
He's not answering.

686
00:58:43,433 --> 00:58:44,596
Hey, boss.

687
00:58:44,851 --> 00:58:46,844
There's a case of beer in there.

688
00:58:51,234 --> 00:58:53,642
- How was your day?
- Great.

689
00:58:55,489 --> 00:58:58,359
- Everybody here?
- Everybody but one of the chicks.

690
00:58:58,825 --> 00:59:00,106
Been watching them?

691
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,195
Celebrity Films.

692
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:21,158
I know all about it.

693
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:22,737
Yeah, you know about what?

694
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,488
About that girl...

695
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,573
...six years ago.

696
01:00:27,207 --> 01:00:29,080
I know what you did to her.

697
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,372
Who is this?

698
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,086
You murdered her.

699
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:35,545
You and your friends.

700
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,749
What the fuck are you talking about?

701
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:40,249
You killed her on film.

702
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,000
Now you're fucked.

703
01:00:42,263 --> 01:00:44,055
You're all fucked.

704
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,809
Come on.

705
01:01:06,204 --> 01:01:08,031
Come on, give me something, Eddie.

706
01:01:20,928 --> 01:01:22,091
It's me.

707
01:01:23,055 --> 01:01:24,430
What do you want?

708
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:25,962
I just got a call.

709
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,887
We got to talk.
And not on the phone.

710
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:32,103
So one of us
has to get on a plane, all right?

711
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,274
Blow me, you paranoid fuck.

712
01:01:38,737 --> 01:01:40,564
Fuck! Fuck!

713
01:01:51,084 --> 01:01:53,456
So you like to watch, paranoid fuck.

714
01:02:01,887 --> 01:02:04,555
Phone is listed under "D. Velvet"
in Manhattan.

715
01:02:04,805 --> 01:02:05,805
Dino Velvet.

716
01:02:05,973 --> 01:02:09,140
He's a producer/director/weirdo.

717
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:10,971
He's like the Jim Jarmusch of S&M.

718
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:12,473
How hard is his stuff?

719
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,892
How hard do you want it?

720
01:02:14,148 --> 01:02:17,813
Bondage, fetish, Gothic hard-core.
Definitely not for the squeamish.

721
01:02:18,069 --> 01:02:19,611
Kind of hard to come by.

722
01:02:19,862 --> 01:02:22,354
Mostly out of the back
of bondage magazines.

723
01:02:22,657 --> 01:02:23,902
But he's got fans.

724
01:02:24,159 --> 01:02:26,448
This guy I know, he thinks it's art.

725
01:02:26,703 --> 01:02:30,073
He's told me Velvet will do
commissions if there's enough dough.

726
01:02:30,333 --> 01:02:32,290
Nothing illegal, but borderline.

727
01:02:32,543 --> 01:02:35,460
If a guy wants to see
a transvestite in a rubber suit...

728
01:02:35,629 --> 01:02:36,874
I got the picture.

729
01:02:37,089 --> 01:02:39,211
Max, get in here!

730
01:02:40,216 --> 01:02:41,591
So...

731
01:02:41,884 --> 01:02:43,343
...you're going to New York?

732
01:02:43,594 --> 01:02:44,792
Maybe.

733
01:02:45,471 --> 01:02:47,214
Looking like that.

734
01:02:47,807 --> 01:02:49,182
You'll need me.

735
01:02:49,433 --> 01:02:52,802
This Frenchie guy is more
than just a fan of Velvet films.

736
01:02:53,020 --> 01:02:54,645
I can get you in if you want.

737
01:02:55,439 --> 01:02:56,720
For more money, of course.

738
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:59,818
Plus expenses. I fly first class.

739
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:01,693
So when are we leaving?

740
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:08,034
What are you doing?

741
01:03:08,995 --> 01:03:12,411
Man, my first time in
the Big Bad Apple.

742
01:03:15,126 --> 01:03:17,083
I told you, don't film me.

743
01:03:17,336 --> 01:03:19,910
Fine, Howard Hughes.

744
01:03:30,141 --> 01:03:32,349
You didn't say it'd be this luxurious.

745
01:03:32,603 --> 01:03:35,807
- It's the Presidential suite.
- A comforting sense of humor.

746
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,850
I'll be a couple of doors down.

747
01:03:38,067 --> 01:03:41,068
Tom, I don't know why
we're staying in this fleabag.

748
01:03:41,321 --> 01:03:43,562
People mind their own
business in fleabags.

749
01:03:43,823 --> 01:03:46,943
I'm going out. Dig up
whatever Velvet tapes you can find.

750
01:03:47,160 --> 01:03:48,160
Get receipts.

751
01:03:49,537 --> 01:03:50,699
Yes, sir.

752
01:03:51,913 --> 01:03:54,867
My husband had
five cash accounts he used.

753
01:03:55,083 --> 01:03:56,662
Between November...

754
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:58,663
...of 1992...

755
01:03:59,297 --> 01:04:00,625
...and March...

756
01:04:00,882 --> 01:04:03,124
...of 1993...

757
01:04:03,384 --> 01:04:07,085
...he wrote one check out
to cash from each account.

758
01:04:08,431 --> 01:04:11,598
My husband never dealt
with money personally.

759
01:04:11,809 --> 01:04:13,352
Certainly not cash.

760
01:04:13,603 --> 01:04:16,390
These checks he wrote
are for very odd amounts.

761
01:04:16,606 --> 01:04:19,726
When totaled together,
the five checks...

762
01:04:19,984 --> 01:04:24,895
...from the five different accounts,
they equal $1 million.

763
01:04:25,614 --> 01:04:27,737
That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.

764
01:04:27,950 --> 01:04:30,073
I only mentioned this because...

765
01:04:30,327 --> 01:04:33,244
...you asked me to look
for anything unusual.

766
01:04:33,539 --> 01:04:36,030
I've got about $5000 left in cash.

767
01:04:36,250 --> 01:04:39,916
I'll need another 50, if you approve
the plan I mentioned earlier.

768
01:04:40,171 --> 01:04:43,755
I'm very close to identifying
the man in the mask.

769
01:04:43,968 --> 01:04:46,174
I'll have Mr. Longdale arrange it.

770
01:04:46,387 --> 01:04:48,296
How will I get it to you?

771
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:50,506
I'll give you the address.

772
01:04:50,808 --> 01:04:54,259
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

773
01:05:26,510 --> 01:05:29,962
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

774
01:05:57,751 --> 01:06:00,621
Who is this?
In the mask, who is he?

775
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:03,373
Come on, wake up.
Who is this?

776
01:06:03,632 --> 01:06:07,298
One of Dino's lunatics.
He's in a bunch of these.

777
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:08,512
What's his name?

778
01:06:08,679 --> 01:06:11,431
I don't know.
That's his whole thing.

779
01:06:11,682 --> 01:06:13,674
He always wears a mask.

780
01:06:13,975 --> 01:06:16,811
He calls himself Machete...
No, Machine.

781
01:06:17,062 --> 01:06:19,849
He calls himself Machine.

782
01:06:21,483 --> 01:06:23,606
He's a lover, man.

783
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:27,064
Definitely loves
what he does for a living.

784
01:06:27,989 --> 01:06:30,026
Can't say the same about you.

785
01:06:40,749 --> 01:06:42,327
Yes, yes.

786
01:06:43,877 --> 01:06:46,629
You can see they really
appreciate my style here.

787
01:06:46,880 --> 01:06:51,044
I'm not the kind to blend in
with the crowd, if you didn't notice.

788
01:06:51,301 --> 01:06:53,792
Like these ladies here,
they like my style.

789
01:06:59,268 --> 01:07:00,268
Who is it?

790
01:07:00,394 --> 01:07:02,185
This is Max California.

791
01:07:02,438 --> 01:07:05,309
I called earlier.
I'm a friend of Frenchie's, from L.A.

792
01:07:05,525 --> 01:07:08,443
My partner and I would like
to speak to Mr. Velvet.

793
01:07:08,695 --> 01:07:09,975
He's not here.

794
01:07:10,655 --> 01:07:12,778
We have to give him
a large sum of money.

795
01:07:13,033 --> 01:07:15,274
If he's not interested, we'll split.

796
01:07:33,179 --> 01:07:35,052
What are you talking about?

797
01:07:35,264 --> 01:07:38,847
Can't you just answer
my simple question?

798
01:07:40,353 --> 01:07:44,053
I asked you a question!
Where the fuck is Laura?!

799
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:47,358
I've been asking you that
the last 10 minutes.

800
01:07:47,568 --> 01:07:49,976
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

801
01:07:50,446 --> 01:07:51,525
You idiot!

802
01:07:51,781 --> 01:07:53,773
Going to shoot in two days?

803
01:07:54,033 --> 01:07:56,239
Man, you're spending my money.

804
01:07:56,494 --> 01:07:58,485
Yeah, you better do that.

805
01:07:59,037 --> 01:08:00,780
Fucking asshole!

806
01:08:01,039 --> 01:08:03,744
It's an honor to meet you.
Thank you for seeing us.

807
01:08:05,293 --> 01:08:06,456
God!

808
01:08:09,130 --> 01:08:10,874
So, what can I do you for?

809
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:16,009
We'd like to commission a film.
A Dino Velvet original, one of a kind.

810
01:08:16,556 --> 01:08:17,885
That's right.

811
01:08:18,392 --> 01:08:20,598
I'm a huge admirer of yours.

812
01:08:20,811 --> 01:08:23,053
God, I love flattery.

813
01:08:23,605 --> 01:08:26,642
You're a genius, Mr. Velvet.
A goddamn genius.

814
01:08:26,858 --> 01:08:29,147
The only one still transferring
film to video.

815
01:08:29,403 --> 01:08:32,569
Nobody really appreciates
that kind of integrity anymore.

816
01:08:32,864 --> 01:08:36,067
The grain and the gritty look you get.

817
01:08:38,661 --> 01:08:39,941
Which is your favourite?

818
01:08:40,162 --> 01:08:43,614
If I had to choose, it'd either be
Choke or Devil.

819
01:08:44,417 --> 01:08:48,497
The subliminal imagery in Choke
is what gets under your skin.

820
01:08:49,589 --> 01:08:53,752
Well, Devil frightened me
as much as it excited me...

821
01:08:54,010 --> 01:08:56,679
...but I'd be hard-pressed
to choose a favourite.

822
01:09:01,268 --> 01:09:04,139
What kind of a budget
are we talking about?

823
01:09:05,230 --> 01:09:09,441
Five thousand now.
Five thousand upon delivery.

824
01:09:09,650 --> 01:09:11,857
Two women. One white, one black.

825
01:09:12,320 --> 01:09:14,396
Hard bondage, of course.

826
01:09:14,822 --> 01:09:16,530
Other than that, trusting...

827
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:18,740
...your artistic interpretation...

828
01:09:18,993 --> 01:09:21,449
...I only have two stipulations.

829
01:09:26,334 --> 01:09:27,794
Challenge me.

830
01:09:29,464 --> 01:09:31,291
I want to watch you work.

831
01:09:32,133 --> 01:09:34,920
You don't want a franchise, do you?

832
01:09:35,512 --> 01:09:38,347
Steal the recipe for my secret...

833
01:09:38,598 --> 01:09:40,756
...hot sauce?

834
01:09:41,684 --> 01:09:42,929
No.

835
01:09:45,021 --> 01:09:46,136
That's good.

836
01:09:46,356 --> 01:09:48,395
I appreciate that.

837
01:09:53,696 --> 01:09:55,155
Second stipulation.

838
01:09:55,406 --> 01:09:57,114
The other performer...

839
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:59,617
...has to be...

840
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:01,619
...that animal you use.

841
01:10:01,871 --> 01:10:03,531
The man in the mask.

842
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:06,370
Machine.

843
01:10:13,591 --> 01:10:15,050
I don't know.

844
01:10:15,927 --> 01:10:17,754
He might be interested.

845
01:10:18,930 --> 01:10:22,132
But I think it'll cost you another...

846
01:10:24,685 --> 01:10:26,723
...five to seven grand.

847
01:10:27,103 --> 01:10:29,891
I can arrange something
really special for ten.

848
01:10:30,357 --> 01:10:31,732
You can do that.

849
01:10:31,942 --> 01:10:33,436
Good enough for me.

850
01:10:35,112 --> 01:10:39,241
I'll just have to put
my thinking cap on.

851
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:46,323
I'm going to keep this as a deposit.

852
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:49,537
You make sure you call me
after 10 o'clock tonight.

853
01:10:49,836 --> 01:10:51,496
10 o'clock.

854
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:59,843
You know, you have a very special,
very beautiful face.

855
01:11:00,095 --> 01:11:02,337
The way light hits it.

856
01:11:03,057 --> 01:11:04,883
I'd like to shoot you.

857
01:11:05,851 --> 01:11:06,882
You don't mind?

858
01:11:08,187 --> 01:11:09,562
I'm camera-shy.

859
01:11:09,980 --> 01:11:12,816
You trust me to take your money,
but not your picture?

860
01:11:13,026 --> 01:11:15,517
Those are two different kinds of trust.

861
01:11:16,029 --> 01:11:18,152
I hope we can do business.

862
01:11:26,999 --> 01:11:30,368
Hoyt Avenue, Brooklyn, 3 o'clock.

863
01:11:33,004 --> 01:11:34,380
I'll be there.

864
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:39,923
I got something to tend to. Thanks.

865
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,046
So are we in the movie business?

866
01:11:44,057 --> 01:11:45,057
That's for you.

867
01:11:45,350 --> 01:11:46,429
- What is it?
- Money.

868
01:11:46,643 --> 01:11:48,267
People use it to purchase goods.

869
01:11:48,478 --> 01:11:51,052
That's awfully generous and everything...

870
01:11:51,274 --> 01:11:53,266
It's not mine.
Don't make a big deal.

871
01:11:53,526 --> 01:11:57,441
There's a plane ticket for the flight
you can catch to L.A. tonight.

872
01:11:57,698 --> 01:11:59,655
This is as far as I want you to go.

873
01:11:59,866 --> 01:12:01,610
What are you talking about?

874
01:12:01,827 --> 01:12:03,369
We're a team.
We're partners.

875
01:12:03,662 --> 01:12:08,453
Max, I'm sure you realize
these people we're dealing with...

876
01:12:09,417 --> 01:12:10,959
...are extremely disturbed.

877
01:12:11,168 --> 01:12:14,253
That's why you need me.
I know disturbed. Look at me.

878
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:17,417
You did a great job.
It's time for you to go home.

879
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,542
But this is, like, our big case.

880
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:22,797
Tom, I know what's going on, okay?

881
01:12:23,347 --> 01:12:24,510
Okay, what?

882
01:12:24,724 --> 01:12:27,594
Dino and Machine and Eddie
made a snuff film, right?

883
01:12:27,852 --> 01:12:31,435
I can't figure out why you're involved.
Maybe the victim...?

884
01:12:31,647 --> 01:12:33,023
First, who said you're right?

885
01:12:33,274 --> 01:12:35,812
Second, who said
anything about a victim?

886
01:12:36,027 --> 01:12:38,151
Only 3 rules in life, Tom Welles.

887
01:12:38,405 --> 01:12:41,608
One, there's always a victim.
And two, don't be it.

888
01:12:41,867 --> 01:12:42,867
And three?

889
01:12:42,909 --> 01:12:44,023
I forgot three.

890
01:12:44,243 --> 01:12:46,450
Good, I want you to forget everything.

891
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:49,912
I want you to get on a plane to L.A.
and forget it all.

892
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:55,829
I get calls for work on the West Coast.
I'd like to call you again.

893
01:12:56,047 --> 01:12:58,335
You're going to look me up and call me?

894
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:02,506
I could use your help. I meant it
when I said I think you're smart.

895
01:13:02,763 --> 01:13:04,886
I'm not patronizing you.

896
01:13:05,098 --> 01:13:06,474
Well, thanks.

897
01:13:06,767 --> 01:13:09,518
All right.
You take care, Max California.

898
01:13:15,859 --> 01:13:18,812
All right, Tom Welles.
Devil's waiting on you.

899
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:43,361
There you are.

900
01:14:43,655 --> 01:14:45,695
Come and join us.

901
01:14:57,379 --> 01:14:59,039
Hello, Machine.

902
01:15:00,090 --> 01:15:01,090
Love your work.

903
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:09,139
Did you bring the money?

904
01:15:10,516 --> 01:15:11,844
It's right here.

905
01:15:12,101 --> 01:15:13,132
Good.

906
01:15:14,561 --> 01:15:15,972
Where are the women?

907
01:15:16,188 --> 01:15:17,682
Women...

908
01:15:18,774 --> 01:15:20,767
...they're always late.

909
01:15:27,535 --> 01:15:29,278
What are these for?

910
01:15:29,495 --> 01:15:31,653
They're just props.

911
01:15:31,914 --> 01:15:34,074
Nice, aren't they?

912
01:15:34,292 --> 01:15:38,373
Machine and I were just talking
about the beauty of knives.

913
01:15:41,757 --> 01:15:44,758
My guests have arrived!

914
01:15:46,929 --> 01:15:51,971
Mr. W., would you be so kind as
to remove any firearms from your person?

915
01:15:52,768 --> 01:15:53,768
What are you doing?

916
01:15:54,937 --> 01:15:57,689
I hate to repeat myself.
It makes me look so stupid.

917
01:15:58,357 --> 01:15:59,520
Slowly.

918
01:15:59,775 --> 01:16:02,017
Please, show me your gun.

919
01:16:03,112 --> 01:16:04,606
Nice and easy!

920
01:16:06,032 --> 01:16:08,190
That's right. Easy.

921
01:16:08,492 --> 01:16:10,117
Good.

922
01:16:10,453 --> 01:16:13,370
Now empty those bullets onto the table.

923
01:16:13,581 --> 01:16:15,040
Very carefully.

924
01:16:15,249 --> 01:16:18,334
- I don't know why you think...
- Shut up, you fuck!

925
01:16:18,836 --> 01:16:23,083
I'll put an arrow right through
your goddamn throat, you understand?

926
01:16:29,180 --> 01:16:30,425
That's him.

927
01:16:31,515 --> 01:16:32,974
Last bullet.
The last one.

928
01:16:33,769 --> 01:16:34,848
Good boy.

929
01:16:35,103 --> 01:16:37,773
Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.

930
01:16:38,148 --> 01:16:39,523
Yes, sir.

931
01:16:39,733 --> 01:16:41,061
Machine!

932
01:16:47,908 --> 01:16:50,825
I didn't know what
to make of you at first.

933
01:16:53,037 --> 01:16:57,165
And you certainly had Eddie here
on pins and needles.

934
01:16:58,793 --> 01:17:01,711
Lo and behold,
from right out of the blue came...

935
01:17:01,922 --> 01:17:06,335
...an old business acquaintance of ours
to explain everything.

936
01:17:06,677 --> 01:17:09,761
Satan ex machina.

937
01:17:10,889 --> 01:17:13,559
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

938
01:17:16,520 --> 01:17:17,551
Get it over with.

939
01:17:17,771 --> 01:17:19,894
Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

940
01:17:22,026 --> 01:17:25,111
What I could do with faces
like these on film.

941
01:17:25,947 --> 01:17:29,611
But on second thought,
why would I need their faces?

942
01:17:30,576 --> 01:17:32,070
You listen to me.

943
01:17:32,327 --> 01:17:33,870
You'll get that film.

944
01:17:34,121 --> 01:17:36,991
You'll bring it back here,
give it to me.

945
01:17:37,207 --> 01:17:41,585
Just so we make this
as efficient as possible...

946
01:17:41,837 --> 01:17:44,412
...there is an incentive.

947
01:17:55,394 --> 01:17:57,553
He's got nothing to do with this.

948
01:17:57,771 --> 01:17:59,563
He doesn't know anything.

949
01:17:59,774 --> 01:18:03,640
Can't you guess
what I'm about to say next?!

950
01:18:05,195 --> 01:18:07,650
If you don't bring me that film...

951
01:18:07,864 --> 01:18:10,189
...we're going to kill him,
fuck him...

952
01:18:10,617 --> 01:18:12,159
...and film it.

953
01:18:15,413 --> 01:18:17,869
If that's not enough for you...

954
01:18:18,124 --> 01:18:20,956
...we're going to go after
your family.

955
01:18:23,627 --> 01:18:25,169
I'll get the film.

956
01:18:27,548 --> 01:18:30,549
Good boy.
You're being very cooperative.

957
01:18:31,135 --> 01:18:33,970
Mr. Longdale here will
keep you company.

958
01:18:35,098 --> 01:18:36,098
Why me?

959
01:18:36,307 --> 01:18:38,714
Because I don't like you,
Mr. Longdale.

960
01:18:48,527 --> 01:18:50,021
Mr. W...

961
01:18:53,573 --> 01:18:54,854
...hurry back.

962
01:18:59,372 --> 01:19:03,701
Since I met you, there isn't much you've
done that I haven't been party to.

963
01:19:03,918 --> 01:19:06,919
None of this would be happening
if you'd given up.

964
01:19:07,171 --> 01:19:09,662
Or not taken the job
in the first place.

965
01:19:09,924 --> 01:19:12,297
I never expected you to get this far.

966
01:19:12,553 --> 01:19:16,632
I hired you because you're young
and completely out of your league.

967
01:19:16,848 --> 01:19:19,174
But I underestimated your ambition.

968
01:19:19,435 --> 01:19:24,393
You took one look at the Christian
compound. It was heady, wasn't it?

969
01:19:24,606 --> 01:19:28,651
You weren't peeking through the gates.
Mrs. Christian welcomed you in.

970
01:19:28,902 --> 01:19:32,354
Do you think people like
the Christians hire people like us...

971
01:19:32,614 --> 01:19:34,773
...as an invitation
to their dinner parties?

972
01:19:35,034 --> 01:19:39,363
No, we're there to clean up the mess,
to wipe their royal asses.

973
01:19:39,580 --> 01:19:41,240
You were asked to buy a snuff film.

974
01:19:41,457 --> 01:19:44,660
They couldn't find one,
so you paid them to make one.

975
01:19:44,918 --> 01:19:46,911
Isn't that what happened?

976
01:19:47,129 --> 01:19:49,797
She was alive till you paid
to have her murdered?

977
01:19:50,006 --> 01:19:51,880
How much did Christian
pay for your conscience?

978
01:19:52,133 --> 01:19:53,133
A million?

979
01:19:53,761 --> 01:19:55,385
I've been well compensated.

980
01:19:55,596 --> 01:19:57,387
But you, I bought cheap.

981
01:19:59,016 --> 01:20:02,515
Just because Mrs. Christian
praised your discretion...

982
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:06,055
...you sat on evidence of murder,
dragged your friend, family...

983
01:20:06,316 --> 01:20:08,724
...into some old graveyard...

984
01:20:08,985 --> 01:20:12,935
...to dig up a dead girl with no name
that nobody remembers.

985
01:20:13,198 --> 01:20:14,478
Mary Anne Mathews.

986
01:20:14,699 --> 01:20:17,700
That was her name.
Her mother remembers her.

987
01:20:17,953 --> 01:20:19,281
I'm bored with this.

988
01:20:19,704 --> 01:20:21,946
You know the difference between us?

989
01:20:22,165 --> 01:20:25,331
I will survive this and profit by it,
whereas you...

990
01:20:25,584 --> 01:20:26,699
...you will not.

991
01:20:26,961 --> 01:20:28,538
Now get the film.

992
01:20:34,134 --> 01:20:35,794
Did you watch it with him?

993
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:37,011
What?

994
01:20:37,096 --> 01:20:39,255
The snuff film.
Did you watch it with him?

995
01:20:39,474 --> 01:20:41,763
This isn't helping your friend.
Get the film.

996
01:20:42,018 --> 01:20:43,133
Did it get him off?

997
01:20:43,603 --> 01:20:45,014
Mr. Christian?

998
01:20:45,272 --> 01:20:48,522
Watching them cut her up like that?
Did he jerk off to it?

999
01:20:48,733 --> 01:20:50,975
Did you hold his cock?
Give him the hand job...

1000
01:20:51,236 --> 01:20:54,023
...while Mary Anne Mathews was dying?!

1001
01:20:54,281 --> 01:20:56,985
- What are you doing?
- Trying to understand!

1002
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,442
What did he want with a snuff film?!

1003
01:20:59,869 --> 01:21:00,869
Why?

1004
01:21:00,995 --> 01:21:02,987
Yes, why? Why?!

1005
01:21:03,247 --> 01:21:05,156
Why did he want a film...

1006
01:21:05,416 --> 01:21:07,871
...of a little girl being butchered?!

1007
01:21:09,253 --> 01:21:10,581
Because he could.

1008
01:21:11,213 --> 01:21:13,122
He did it because he could.

1009
01:21:15,176 --> 01:21:17,384
What reason were you looking for?

1010
01:21:21,476 --> 01:21:22,721
Now.

1011
01:21:37,074 --> 01:21:38,319
Here.

1012
01:21:39,076 --> 01:21:40,487
Shoot me.

1013
01:21:49,462 --> 01:21:51,869
Mr. Welles, the film, please.

1014
01:21:53,007 --> 01:21:54,205
Let him go first.

1015
01:21:54,467 --> 01:21:56,874
Do whatever you want to me,
but let him go.

1016
01:21:57,094 --> 01:21:59,632
Very well.
Set him free, Machine.

1017
01:22:36,175 --> 01:22:38,084
- Is that it?
- That's it.

1018
01:22:38,344 --> 01:22:39,542
Bravo.

1019
01:22:41,013 --> 01:22:42,805
You don't want to miss this...

1020
01:22:43,141 --> 01:22:44,801
...Mr. Welles.

1021
01:22:54,026 --> 01:22:55,936
So it ends.

1022
01:22:57,989 --> 01:23:00,610
As if she never existed.

1023
01:23:01,117 --> 01:23:04,616
Don't blame yourself.
You were in way over your head.

1024
01:23:05,204 --> 01:23:07,162
You motherfuckers!

1025
01:23:09,333 --> 01:23:11,871
You smalltime motherfuckers.

1026
01:23:13,629 --> 01:23:15,456
I want to know something.

1027
01:23:15,883 --> 01:23:19,880
Why you're still smalltime with a
million dollars to spread around?

1028
01:23:20,471 --> 01:23:21,471
Million?

1029
01:23:21,513 --> 01:23:24,430
Yeah! That's what Christian
gave Longdale!

1030
01:23:25,266 --> 01:23:27,010
That's what he gave you, right?

1031
01:23:27,226 --> 01:23:28,555
A million in cash?

1032
01:23:28,978 --> 01:23:31,137
You stupid fucking trash!

1033
01:23:31,356 --> 01:23:35,306
What the hell...?
Is he talking dollars here?

1034
01:23:35,653 --> 01:23:37,063
No, he's lying.

1035
01:23:37,404 --> 01:23:38,815
Did you fuck me?

1036
01:23:40,200 --> 01:23:41,314
Did you fuck me on this?

1037
01:23:41,534 --> 01:23:42,697
Of course not, Edward!

1038
01:23:42,911 --> 01:23:44,950
Then what's he talking about?

1039
01:23:45,163 --> 01:23:48,164
He's saying that Longdale fucked us...

1040
01:23:48,416 --> 01:23:51,417
...which is so totally,
completely bizarre.

1041
01:23:52,045 --> 01:23:53,045
Stay back.

1042
01:23:53,630 --> 01:23:54,630
Stay away from me.

1043
01:23:55,507 --> 01:23:56,787
Put the bow down!

1044
01:23:57,008 --> 01:23:59,000
I told you not to trust the prick.

1045
01:23:59,218 --> 01:24:01,887
Mr. Longdale, if there's no honor...

1046
01:24:02,096 --> 01:24:03,887
...among perverts and pornographers...

1047
01:24:04,098 --> 01:24:06,221
...the whole business would fall apart.

1048
01:24:06,433 --> 01:24:10,217
Because there's no records,
no contracts, no legal recourse.

1049
01:24:10,479 --> 01:24:11,973
So if someone...

1050
01:24:12,231 --> 01:24:13,511
...cheats us...

1051
01:24:13,732 --> 01:24:15,358
...that person can't be trusted.

1052
01:24:15,819 --> 01:24:18,654
That person could turn us in,
have us killed.

1053
01:24:19,406 --> 01:24:23,190
So we don't have a choice,
do we, Mr. Longdale?

1054
01:24:23,410 --> 01:24:26,529
I want this to be over.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

1055
01:24:26,746 --> 01:24:28,205
Eddie, take your gun out.

1056
01:24:28,707 --> 01:24:29,707
Fuck you.

1057
01:24:29,874 --> 01:24:32,081
Take it out now! And drop it.

1058
01:24:32,294 --> 01:24:33,917
Or I will shoot.

1059
01:24:34,336 --> 01:24:36,163
Don't be stupid, Edward.

1060
01:24:41,635 --> 01:24:43,177
Kick it in my direction.

1061
01:24:46,891 --> 01:24:49,464
Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.

1062
01:24:54,107 --> 01:24:55,482
Action.

1063
01:25:07,121 --> 01:25:08,864
This is wrong.

1064
01:25:09,497 --> 01:25:11,407
Something's wrong.

1065
01:25:11,625 --> 01:25:13,083
God, not like this.

1066
01:25:15,087 --> 01:25:17,413
I am supposed to have...

1067
01:25:18,174 --> 01:25:19,965
...something more cinematic.

1068
01:25:20,676 --> 01:25:22,468
Kill them, Machine.

1069
01:25:23,763 --> 01:25:25,340
Kill them all.

1070
01:25:32,939 --> 01:25:34,101
Machine!

1071
01:26:15,398 --> 01:26:16,398
Stop, Eddie!

1072
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:20,686
I swear to Christ,
I'll shoot you in the back!

1073
01:26:22,404 --> 01:26:23,518
Take off the mask.

1074
01:26:25,657 --> 01:26:27,283
Take off the fucking mask!

1075
01:26:27,618 --> 01:26:29,576
He's only got one bullet!

1076
01:28:11,807 --> 01:28:13,301
Amy, listen carefully.

1077
01:28:13,517 --> 01:28:15,842
- Tom, where are you?
- Amy, just listen.

1078
01:28:16,061 --> 01:28:18,433
Take Cindy.
Get out of the house now.

1079
01:28:18,689 --> 01:28:20,931
Go to where we spent
Fourth of July weekend.

1080
01:28:21,150 --> 01:28:24,068
- Why? What's wrong?
- Amy, please. I can't.

1081
01:28:24,321 --> 01:28:26,313
I'll be there in three hours.

1082
01:28:26,823 --> 01:28:28,531
I'm on my way! Go now!

1083
01:28:28,992 --> 01:28:30,866
Tom, you're scaring me.

1084
01:28:31,077 --> 01:28:32,821
Please, Amy, just do it!

1085
01:28:33,830 --> 01:28:35,953
Okay, bye. I'm going.

1086
01:28:43,715 --> 01:28:45,672
Mrs. Christian, it's Tom Welles.

1087
01:28:45,884 --> 01:28:47,212
Longdale is dead.

1088
01:28:47,427 --> 01:28:49,336
He was killed by the men
who made the film.

1089
01:28:49,554 --> 01:28:52,757
He hired them for your husband.
Kept most of the million.

1090
01:28:53,016 --> 01:28:54,724
The film is real!

1091
01:28:54,935 --> 01:28:56,215
They killed that girl!

1092
01:28:58,313 --> 01:28:59,641
Mrs. Christian?

1093
01:28:59,856 --> 01:29:02,608
I'm still here, Mr. Welles.

1094
01:29:02,817 --> 01:29:04,312
I'm sorry.
I know this must be...

1095
01:29:04,569 --> 01:29:05,898
Are you in danger?

1096
01:29:06,112 --> 01:29:09,030
We'll go to the police.
I'll tell you everything tonight.

1097
01:29:09,241 --> 01:29:10,950
We'll call the police in the morning.

1098
01:29:11,327 --> 01:29:12,327
All right.

1099
01:29:12,787 --> 01:29:13,787
Eight o'clock?

1100
01:29:13,996 --> 01:29:15,823
Yes, eight o'clock is fine.

1101
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:17,284
Do you know...

1102
01:29:17,541 --> 01:29:21,586
...what the poor girl's name was?

1103
01:29:23,881 --> 01:29:25,838
Mary Anne Mathews.

1104
01:29:29,595 --> 01:29:30,595
Thank you.

1105
01:29:30,930 --> 01:29:33,006
Mr. Welles, goodbye.

1106
01:30:30,820 --> 01:30:32,612
Are you okay?

1107
01:30:34,574 --> 01:30:35,772
Are you?

1108
01:30:36,743 --> 01:30:39,068
Why haven't you called me?

1109
01:30:41,790 --> 01:30:45,075
Why did you disappear
off the face of the Earth?

1110
01:30:46,253 --> 01:30:47,832
You're bleeding.

1111
01:30:48,423 --> 01:30:50,001
Are those handcuffs?

1112
01:30:50,258 --> 01:30:52,085
Were you locked up?

1113
01:30:53,011 --> 01:30:55,716
Kept from a phone? What happened?

1114
01:30:55,931 --> 01:30:56,931
Start talking, Tom.

1115
01:30:57,057 --> 01:31:01,304
Because if you want to stay married,
you can't treat me this way!

1116
01:31:02,020 --> 01:31:03,264
You're right.

1117
01:31:03,521 --> 01:31:05,478
Everything you say is right.

1118
01:31:07,775 --> 01:31:10,267
That won't do it.
That's not enough, Tom.

1119
01:31:10,529 --> 01:31:11,691
Not anymore.

1120
01:31:12,864 --> 01:31:15,402
I'm not going to let
anything happen to us.

1121
01:31:15,659 --> 01:31:17,817
Look where we are!

1122
01:31:18,328 --> 01:31:20,997
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself! Look!

1123
01:31:21,998 --> 01:31:23,409
You son of a bitch.

1124
01:31:23,667 --> 01:31:27,415
You don't even have any idea
what you're putting me through.

1125
01:31:29,339 --> 01:31:32,590
What was I supposed to think
happened to you?

1126
01:31:38,141 --> 01:31:40,428
We're going to stay here a few days.

1127
01:31:40,684 --> 01:31:42,059
It's just a few days.

1128
01:31:42,311 --> 01:31:43,591
I'm sorry.

1129
01:31:43,854 --> 01:31:45,763
There's no other way around this.

1130
01:31:45,981 --> 01:31:47,558
I swear, I swear...

1131
01:31:49,860 --> 01:31:52,944
...I won't let anything happen to us.
I'll take care of this.

1132
01:31:53,196 --> 01:31:54,821
I swear it.

1133
01:31:55,741 --> 01:31:57,366
I swear it.

1134
01:31:59,245 --> 01:32:01,368
Now I have to go back out.

1135
01:32:02,165 --> 01:32:03,363
Where?

1136
01:32:06,711 --> 01:32:08,917
I have to see Mrs. Christian.

1137
01:32:09,839 --> 01:32:11,748
She's the only witness.

1138
01:32:12,925 --> 01:32:14,124
To what?

1139
01:32:16,512 --> 01:32:18,422
We're going to be okay.

1140
01:32:21,392 --> 01:32:23,184
We're going to be okay.

1141
01:32:37,367 --> 01:32:39,608
Tom Welles.
Mrs. Christian's expecting me.

1142
01:32:39,869 --> 01:32:41,696
Yes, she left instructions.

1143
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:44,988
I have to see her now.
It's extremely urgent.

1144
01:32:45,750 --> 01:32:49,582
Mrs. Christian chose to take
her own life this afternoon, Mr. Welles.

1145
01:32:54,967 --> 01:32:56,247
But I just...

1146
01:32:56,927 --> 01:32:58,552
No, no, I just...

1147
01:33:00,014 --> 01:33:01,509
I just spoke to her.

1148
01:33:01,766 --> 01:33:04,969
Her instructions were
that this first envelope...

1149
01:33:05,812 --> 01:33:07,223
...is for Mary's family.

1150
01:33:07,649 --> 01:33:10,436
She wrote that you'd understand
what that meant.

1151
01:33:11,111 --> 01:33:13,353
And the second envelope is for you.

1152
01:33:15,532 --> 01:33:20,028
Services will be held next week,
if you'd like to attend.

1153
01:33:21,121 --> 01:33:22,745
I am sorry, sir.

1154
01:33:23,456 --> 01:33:24,619
Good night, sir.

1155
01:34:00,368 --> 01:34:01,945
What are you doing?

1156
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:06,282
I have to go back.

1157
01:34:17,634 --> 01:34:19,343
Whatever it is...

1158
01:34:19,720 --> 01:34:21,380
...wherever you were...

1159
01:34:21,597 --> 01:34:23,922
...just forget about it.

1160
01:34:24,141 --> 01:34:25,850
You stay here.

1161
01:34:26,353 --> 01:34:27,895
I can't.

1162
01:34:31,024 --> 01:34:34,144
And risk us?
Risk your family? Why?

1163
01:34:35,612 --> 01:34:38,232
There's no one left
to finish this but me.

1164
01:34:39,198 --> 01:34:41,356
I'll call you
when it's safe to go home.

1165
01:34:44,078 --> 01:34:46,569
We may not be there when you get back.

1166
01:35:01,011 --> 01:35:04,215
Cindy's education, and a lot more.

1167
01:35:13,984 --> 01:35:15,561
I love you.

1168
01:36:07,455 --> 01:36:09,613
Put your hands on your head.
Down on your knees.

1169
01:36:11,751 --> 01:36:13,744
You think I'm fucking around?

1170
01:36:16,839 --> 01:36:17,919
Hurts, doesn't it?

1171
01:36:18,132 --> 01:36:19,543
What the fuck do you want?

1172
01:36:19,759 --> 01:36:20,922
Who's Machine?

1173
01:36:21,135 --> 01:36:22,250
Where does he live?

1174
01:36:23,095 --> 01:36:24,257
I don't know.

1175
01:36:24,513 --> 01:36:25,924
I want his name.

1176
01:36:26,265 --> 01:36:28,506
I don't know his fucking name.

1177
01:36:31,478 --> 01:36:33,720
I will never get tired of hurting you.

1178
01:36:33,939 --> 01:36:38,068
I don't know his name. He shows up
in his mask, he leaves in his mask.

1179
01:36:38,319 --> 01:36:40,111
He's from New York somewhere.

1180
01:36:45,703 --> 01:36:47,327
Get in the car.

1181
01:36:48,956 --> 01:36:49,956
Why?

1182
01:36:50,541 --> 01:36:52,830
You're going to show me
where he killed her.

1183
01:36:53,752 --> 01:36:54,867
Fuck you!

1184
01:36:57,131 --> 01:36:59,039
All right, you fuck.

1185
01:37:13,188 --> 01:37:15,680
What did you do before
you brought her here?

1186
01:37:16,609 --> 01:37:19,064
Tell her how beautiful she was...

1187
01:37:20,322 --> 01:37:22,563
...how you'd make her a big star?

1188
01:37:27,871 --> 01:37:29,365
Talk her up?

1189
01:37:33,668 --> 01:37:35,909
What the fuck do you want from me?

1190
01:37:39,924 --> 01:37:41,548
I want to know.

1191
01:37:44,845 --> 01:37:46,339
You want to know?

1192
01:37:50,184 --> 01:37:53,269
She was nothing.
A little pussy off the street.

1193
01:37:53,480 --> 01:37:56,564
Girl like that disappears,
nobody gives a shit.

1194
01:37:57,734 --> 01:38:00,023
Yeah, I talked her up.

1195
01:38:00,320 --> 01:38:03,654
Told her what she wanted to hear,
that she'd be a star...

1196
01:38:03,865 --> 01:38:07,151
...she'd make a lot of money,
and all the rest of the bullshit.

1197
01:38:07,369 --> 01:38:11,579
When I was finished, she was all
excited about her big screen test.

1198
01:38:13,290 --> 01:38:14,950
I called up Dino...

1199
01:38:15,209 --> 01:38:18,459
...he and Machine flew out here.
We had a little party.

1200
01:38:20,089 --> 01:38:21,998
What else you want to know?

1201
01:38:22,716 --> 01:38:24,508
You saw the film, right?

1202
01:38:25,302 --> 01:38:26,761
You know the ending.

1203
01:38:28,973 --> 01:38:31,380
Nobody else saw you bring her in?

1204
01:38:33,561 --> 01:38:36,597
Who's going to see?
Place is a fucking shithole.

1205
01:38:40,192 --> 01:38:42,101
I brought her in and she...

1206
01:38:43,904 --> 01:38:46,394
...saw Machine
standing in the corner.

1207
01:38:47,825 --> 01:38:49,533
She started crying...

1208
01:38:51,495 --> 01:38:53,702
...making these little noises.

1209
01:38:55,791 --> 01:38:58,709
So I slapped her around a bit
just to shut her up.

1210
01:38:59,003 --> 01:39:00,165
Dino...

1211
01:39:00,421 --> 01:39:02,413
...fed her a bunch of pills.

1212
01:39:03,968 --> 01:39:06,637
Machine put down the plastic over here.

1213
01:39:09,849 --> 01:39:11,842
Just started cutting her up.

1214
01:39:15,688 --> 01:39:18,060
That's it. She's dead.

1215
01:39:18,274 --> 01:39:21,476
She's been dead a long time.
Nobody gives a shit but you.

1216
01:39:36,125 --> 01:39:37,833
You wanted to know.

1217
01:39:38,211 --> 01:39:39,835
Now you know.

1218
01:39:41,881 --> 01:39:43,292
You were in here.

1219
01:39:43,508 --> 01:39:47,173
You watched Mary Anne
bleed to death from here.

1220
01:39:48,638 --> 01:39:49,752
Why?

1221
01:39:51,557 --> 01:39:53,349
Why did you watch?

1222
01:39:54,227 --> 01:39:55,638
I felt like it.

1223
01:39:57,771 --> 01:39:59,562
I never saw nobody get done.

1224
01:40:00,732 --> 01:40:01,732
Why?

1225
01:40:02,985 --> 01:40:05,191
Did you get hard? Did you come?

1226
01:40:05,404 --> 01:40:07,942
No. It made me sick.

1227
01:40:08,198 --> 01:40:09,823
But what do I give a shit...

1228
01:40:10,033 --> 01:40:14,115
...if some rich fucking wacko wants
to beat off to something like that?

1229
01:40:14,373 --> 01:40:15,701
Stay down!

1230
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:20,250
It was something I did for money.

1231
01:40:22,756 --> 01:40:24,832
I needed the fucking money.

1232
01:40:25,509 --> 01:40:27,003
Where is she?

1233
01:40:27,219 --> 01:40:28,678
Where did you put her body?

1234
01:40:29,179 --> 01:40:31,089
I buried it in the woods.

1235
01:40:32,348 --> 01:40:33,348
You won't find it.

1236
01:40:33,474 --> 01:40:35,716
And even if you do, what do you got?

1237
01:40:35,935 --> 01:40:38,177
You got a girl's skeleton, that's it.

1238
01:40:38,438 --> 01:40:40,514
Without the film, you got nothing.

1239
01:40:41,399 --> 01:40:43,356
All you can do is cut me loose.

1240
01:40:43,568 --> 01:40:45,975
Without the film, you got nothing...

1241
01:40:46,195 --> 01:40:47,820
What the fuck are you doing?

1242
01:40:48,031 --> 01:40:49,940
- Hands behind your back.
- Fuck you!

1243
01:40:50,783 --> 01:40:53,274
Put your hands behind your back!

1244
01:40:53,494 --> 01:40:54,953
All right.

1245
01:41:00,169 --> 01:41:02,293
What the fuck are you doing?

1246
01:41:08,093 --> 01:41:10,003
I'm going to kill you.

1247
01:41:11,430 --> 01:41:13,339
I'm going to kill you.

1248
01:41:15,059 --> 01:41:18,428
And I'm going to leave you here
just like you left her.

1249
01:41:20,397 --> 01:41:22,189
You're not going to kill me.

1250
01:41:22,900 --> 01:41:24,063
You don't have it in you.

1251
01:41:25,779 --> 01:41:28,317
You going to shoot me
with your own gun?

1252
01:41:28,532 --> 01:41:29,860
Registered in your name?

1253
01:41:32,285 --> 01:41:34,859
You thought this through,
didn't you, genius?

1254
01:41:35,205 --> 01:41:37,530
You'll have to dig
the bullets out of my head.

1255
01:41:37,791 --> 01:41:39,499
That'll be nice.

1256
01:41:41,504 --> 01:41:43,246
Or you could dig a hole.

1257
01:41:44,089 --> 01:41:47,540
Dig it with your own hands and
bury me next to your girlfriend.

1258
01:41:48,176 --> 01:41:49,421
Go ahead.

1259
01:41:50,095 --> 01:41:51,174
Pull the fucking trigger.

1260
01:41:51,763 --> 01:41:52,763
Go ahead.

1261
01:41:52,848 --> 01:41:55,006
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, do it.

1262
01:41:55,225 --> 01:41:56,684
You faggot!

1263
01:41:58,854 --> 01:42:00,843
What do you want me to do?
Start crying?

1264
01:42:01,061 --> 01:42:03,552
Like a baby?
" I'm so sorry I killed the girl."

1265
01:42:03,772 --> 01:42:05,564
Fuck you! And fuck her!

1266
01:42:05,774 --> 01:42:09,642
Go ahead, put me out of my misery.
Pull the fucking trigger.

1267
01:42:10,821 --> 01:42:12,363
Pull the fucking trigger.

1268
01:42:12,906 --> 01:42:13,938
Do it!

1269
01:42:14,700 --> 01:42:15,779
Do it!

1270
01:42:23,124 --> 01:42:24,868
You can't do it.

1271
01:42:25,794 --> 01:42:27,787
You little pansy bitch!

1272
01:42:28,005 --> 01:42:29,167
Look at you.

1273
01:42:29,423 --> 01:42:31,380
Big fucking hero man.

1274
01:42:31,592 --> 01:42:33,134
You can't fucking do it.

1275
01:42:35,053 --> 01:42:36,465
Look at him.

1276
01:42:37,265 --> 01:42:38,925
Big fucking hero.

1277
01:42:39,976 --> 01:42:42,052
Go on home to your wifey!

1278
01:42:43,188 --> 01:42:44,896
You pussy!

1279
01:42:45,607 --> 01:42:47,516
You big fucking pussy!

1280
01:42:49,402 --> 01:42:51,858
What are you going to do now, faggot?

1281
01:42:54,239 --> 01:42:56,398
You can't go to the cops!

1282
01:42:57,743 --> 01:43:02,287
Send me your wife and daughter.
We'll make a film, you faggot!

1283
01:43:05,668 --> 01:43:06,867
Shit!

1284
01:43:07,337 --> 01:43:08,962
You punk-ass!

1285
01:43:55,929 --> 01:43:57,720
Mrs. Mathews?

1286
01:43:58,015 --> 01:43:59,806
It's Thomas.

1287
01:44:00,100 --> 01:44:01,760
Thomas Hart.

1288
01:44:02,019 --> 01:44:05,517
I was there a few weeks ago
asking about your daughter.

1289
01:44:05,938 --> 01:44:08,227
Yeah, you found her diary.

1290
01:44:08,482 --> 01:44:09,977
Thank you.

1291
01:44:10,651 --> 01:44:12,858
She did leave a note...

1292
01:44:13,237 --> 01:44:17,531
...and her stupid boyfriend
dumped her in California...

1293
01:44:17,825 --> 01:44:19,236
...so I told the FBI.

1294
01:44:20,369 --> 01:44:21,947
Remember when...

1295
01:44:22,663 --> 01:44:25,498
...I asked you if you'd want to know...

1296
01:44:26,626 --> 01:44:27,871
...the truth...

1297
01:44:28,836 --> 01:44:30,496
...no matter what?

1298
01:44:31,297 --> 01:44:35,165
Some men, they took her and
they killed her and they buried her.

1299
01:44:36,428 --> 01:44:38,053
I'm sorry.

1300
01:44:38,305 --> 01:44:39,305
I'm sorry.

1301
01:44:39,890 --> 01:44:41,965
I want to punish them for what they did.

1302
01:44:42,433 --> 01:44:44,473
Why are you saying this?

1303
01:44:44,685 --> 01:44:46,678
I can hurt them.

1304
01:44:46,896 --> 01:44:50,181
Give me your permission
to hurt them, please.

1305
01:44:51,317 --> 01:44:53,191
Tell me how much she meant to you.

1306
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:56,562
Just tell me that you loved her.

1307
01:44:56,781 --> 01:44:59,819
- Please tell me that you loved her.
- I love her.

1308
01:45:00,161 --> 01:45:02,118
I love her so much.

1309
01:45:04,582 --> 01:45:06,824
I love her so much.

1310
01:45:13,883 --> 01:45:15,212
Who's that?

1311
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:22,715
Die, you motherfucker, die!

1312
01:46:58,406 --> 01:46:59,406
New York Hospital.

1313
01:46:59,615 --> 01:47:01,524
Connect me to the duty nurse.

1314
01:47:01,742 --> 01:47:02,742
Emergency.

1315
01:47:02,951 --> 01:47:05,323
It's Lt. Anderson of the 13th precinct.

1316
01:47:05,578 --> 01:47:08,663
Have you admitted an adult male
with an abdominal wound...

1317
01:47:08,873 --> 01:47:11,447
...in the last 48 hours?
A stabbing incident.

1318
01:47:11,710 --> 01:47:13,168
Abdominal wound?

1319
01:47:13,420 --> 01:47:14,451
No, not one.

1320
01:47:14,713 --> 01:47:15,875
Thank you.

1321
01:47:16,089 --> 01:47:19,707
I'm looking for a stabbing victim.
Male. Maybe six feet.

1322
01:47:19,927 --> 01:47:22,003
Filed a bogus report.

1323
01:47:22,555 --> 01:47:25,128
We had a guy in on Monday, I think.

1324
01:47:25,349 --> 01:47:27,674
It would've been
yesterday or the day before.

1325
01:47:27,893 --> 01:47:28,893
Sorry.

1326
01:47:29,479 --> 01:47:32,266
- Queens County Emergency.
- Hi, Lt. Anderson.

1327
01:47:32,482 --> 01:47:34,226
We had a stabbing incident...

1328
01:47:34,443 --> 01:47:36,815
...and supposed victim gave us
a false name.

1329
01:47:37,029 --> 01:47:38,901
A male with an abdominal wound.

1330
01:47:39,113 --> 01:47:41,152
Hold on. Let me check my records.

1331
01:47:41,407 --> 01:47:44,159
There was a patient treated yesterday.

1332
01:47:44,368 --> 01:47:46,361
Star tattoo on his right hand?

1333
01:47:46,579 --> 01:47:48,239
Yes. George Anthony Higgins.

1334
01:47:48,497 --> 01:47:52,875
Insurance policy is under his
mother's name, Doris Veronica Higgins.

1335
01:47:53,127 --> 01:47:55,416
That's him.
Can you give me an address?

1336
01:47:55,629 --> 01:47:58,963
It's under her address. Douglaston.
Need a street?

1337
01:48:35,045 --> 01:48:38,461
I really wish you'd go
to church with me tonight.

1338
01:48:43,470 --> 01:48:45,297
I love you, son.

1339
01:48:49,308 --> 01:48:51,799
I'll be home by 10. Bye-bye.

1340
01:53:44,943 --> 01:53:47,019
You know the best part
of killing someone?

1341
01:53:47,612 --> 01:53:49,651
The look on their face.

1342
01:53:49,906 --> 01:53:51,314
It's that look...

1343
01:53:51,530 --> 01:53:53,190
...not when they're threatened...

1344
01:53:53,406 --> 01:53:55,066
...not when you hurt them...

1345
01:53:55,283 --> 01:53:57,953
...not even when they see the knife.

1346
01:53:58,370 --> 01:54:00,493
It's when they feel the knife go in.

1347
01:54:00,705 --> 01:54:01,786
That's it.

1348
01:54:02,333 --> 01:54:04,041
It's surprise.

1349
01:54:04,252 --> 01:54:06,291
They can't believe
it's really happening.

1350
01:54:06,587 --> 01:54:07,702
She had that look.

1351
01:54:08,296 --> 01:54:11,582
The girl, when she knew
it wasn't just porno.

1352
01:54:11,800 --> 01:54:13,839
You feel how hard I am?

1353
01:54:24,688 --> 01:54:26,183
Take off the mask.

1354
01:54:42,373 --> 01:54:44,614
What did you expect, a monster?

1355
01:54:52,760 --> 01:54:54,633
My name's George.

1356
01:54:54,887 --> 01:54:56,796
You probably knew that already.

1357
01:54:59,349 --> 01:55:01,591
Can't get your mind around it, huh?

1358
01:55:01,810 --> 01:55:03,352
I don't have any answers.

1359
01:55:03,562 --> 01:55:06,682
Nothing I can say will
make you sleep easier at night.

1360
01:55:06,899 --> 01:55:09,816
I wasn't beaten. I wasn't molested.

1361
01:55:10,027 --> 01:55:11,936
Mommy didn't abuse me.

1362
01:55:13,781 --> 01:55:15,358
Daddy never raped me.

1363
01:55:16,158 --> 01:55:18,151
I'm only what I am.

1364
01:55:18,368 --> 01:55:20,159
That's all there is to it!

1365
01:55:32,633 --> 01:55:34,210
There's no mystery.

1366
01:55:34,426 --> 01:55:37,962
Things I do, I do them because
I like them.

1367
01:55:39,391 --> 01:55:41,099
Because I want to.

1368
01:56:29,107 --> 01:56:31,348
You've been stabbed?
How many times?

1369
01:56:31,567 --> 01:56:33,974
Sir, can you tell me your name?

1370
01:57:25,331 --> 01:57:26,611
Is that you?

1371
01:57:30,336 --> 01:57:31,499
My God!

1372
01:57:49,312 --> 01:57:50,854
Save me.

1373
01:57:55,986 --> 01:57:57,694
Save me.

1374
01:59:13,775 --> 01:59:15,234
Dear Mr. Welles.

1375
01:59:15,485 --> 01:59:16,944
Thank you for writing...

1376
01:59:17,153 --> 01:59:19,193
...and telling me your real name...

1377
01:59:19,447 --> 01:59:22,484
...who you really are
and what really happened.

1378
01:59:22,742 --> 01:59:25,067
I'm glad those men are dead.

1379
01:59:25,370 --> 01:59:28,370
But nothing will ever
fill the hole in my heart.

1380
01:59:28,622 --> 01:59:31,623
I will try to use the money
you sent for some good...

1381
01:59:31,834 --> 01:59:34,206
...after I get some help for myself.

1382
01:59:34,461 --> 01:59:36,869
I hated you for telling me the truth...

1383
01:59:37,089 --> 01:59:40,458
...but now I realize you and I
are the only people...

1384
01:59:40,718 --> 01:59:43,339
...that ever really
cared about Mary Anne.

1385
01:59:43,595 --> 01:59:45,220
Yours truly...

1386
01:59:45,514 --> 01:59:46,925
...Janet Mathews.
