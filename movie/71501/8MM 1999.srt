哈里斯堡机场

7
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,800
你女婿白天处理干洗生意
Your son-in-law dealt with the dry cleaning franchise during the day.

8
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,160
他每晚都见那女人
He saw that woman every night.

9
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,320
详情在我的报告内 还有那女人的资料
The specifics are in my report, and information about the woman.

10
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,920
我了解这事很不愉快
It's unpleasant, I know.

11
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:09,400
他不是很谨慎吗？
Discreet, isn't he?

12
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,560
蠢货
What an imbecile!

13
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,920
我尝试警告我女儿
I tried to warn my daughter...

14
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,240
但你能做什么？
...but what can you do?

15
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,240
我担心孩子
I worry about the children.

16
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,760
如果没有别的事 我的账单在信封内
My invoice is in the envelope, if that's all.

17
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,520
好谢谢你威尔斯先生
Yes, Mr. Welles. Thank you.

20
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,400
有人吗？
Hello?

21
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,400
你回来了
You're home.

22
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,720
我们在这里
We're back here.

23
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:14,800
一切顺利吗？
How did it go?

24
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,120
还不错吧
I think very well.

25
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,640
很好
Good.

26

甜心爹地回来了
Daddy's home, sweetie.

27
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:23,160
你教科书工作如何？
How's the textbook business?

28
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,520
那个联邦剧场的方案 我收到一份一万字的材料
I got 10,000 words on the federal theatre project.

29
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,160
应该只有四千字 但作者拒绝修改
It should be 4,000 and the writer doesn't want to change anything.

30
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,640
所以有点麻烦
So kind of bad.

31
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,640
迈阿密怎样？
How was Miami?

32
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,400
不错只是寂寞
Fine. Lonesome.

33
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:39,560
就算付我很多钱 我也不要住在那
Couldn't pay me enough to live down there.

34
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,480
那你为什么去？
Then why'd you go?

35
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,080
迈克尔森议员有很多有势力的朋友
Senator Michaelson has powerful friends.

36
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,920
哈啰仙蒂
Hello, Cinderella.

37
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,680
想我吗？我好想你
Did you miss me? I sure missed you.

38
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,520
-她很想你 -这才对
-She missed you. -That's my girl.

39
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,080
她想你我也想你
She missed you. I missed you.

40
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:02,840
你吸烟？
You been smoking?

41
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,120
吸烟？ 我没有吸烟
Smoking? I'm not smoking.

42
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,080
别这样宝贝 
Come on, honey.

43
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,320
你一身的烟味
You reek of it.

44
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,960
艾美我坐在酒吧内 跟踪那男人
Amy, I've been sitting around in bars following this guy.

45
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,040
这就是你给我的见面礼？
Is this the first thing I get?

46
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,960
-你在指责我吗？ -我没有指责你
-You're accusing me? -I'm not accusing you.

47
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,880
我没有吸烟好不好？ 我们以前就讲过了
I'm not smoking, okay? We've been all through that.

48
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,120
我去弄晚餐你肚子饿吗？
I'll make dinner. Are you hungry?

49
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,360
你烧饭？
You're cooking?

50
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,120
我想你
I missed you.

51
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,640
我不喜欢你不在家
I don't like it when you leave.

52
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,880
该我去吗？
Should I go?

53
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,960
我去吧
I'm going to do it.

54
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,000
来吧
Come on.

55
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,000
有什么事仙蒂？
What's all the trouble, Cinderella?

56
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,320
乖乖
There, there.

57
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,680
我爱你
I love you.

58
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:24,520
我爱你
I love you.

59
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,280
宝贝 电话
Honey, phone!

60
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,600
好我在听
Okay, I've got it!

61
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,520
对不起我正在换电话
Sorry, I was just switching phones.

62
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,880
很荣幸认识你 朗先生
It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Mr. Longdale.

63
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,280
我有什么能为你效劳？
How can I be of assistance to you?

64
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:09,640
四点整没问题
Four o'clock would be fine.

65
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,720
我想我知道在那里
I think I know where it is.

66
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,360
威尔斯先生 我是丹尼·朗 我们通过电话
Mr. Welles, Daniel Longdale. We spoke on the phone.

67
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,360
你好
Pleasure.

68
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:03,680
我是克里斯家族的律师和财产处理人
I'm the Christians' attorney and one of the executors of the estate.

69
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,000
这位是克里斯太太
This is Mrs. Christian.

70
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,000
很荣幸认识你夫人
It's an honour to meet you, ma'am.

71
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,760
威尔斯先生 你有很高的评价
You come highly recommended, Mr. Welles.

72
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,840
我和我在哈里斯堡兰卡士达 以及荷西的合伙人谈过
I've spoken to assoclates of mine in Harrisburg and Lancaster and Hershey.

73
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,680
你认识很多有影响力的人物
You have influential friends.

74
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,960
我很庆幸可以为我崇拜的人提供服务
I've been privileged to provide services for people I admire.

75
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,600
你的谨慎被赞赏
You were praised for your discretion...

76
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,120
还有你能保守秘密
...your strict adherence to confidentiality.

77
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,280
谢谢你夫人
Thank you, ma'am.

78
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,560
你知道我丈夫最近逝世
As you know, my husband passed away recently.

79
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,040
请节哀夫人
My condolences, Mrs. Christian.

80
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:38,800
他的离开留给我….
His passing has left me...

81
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,560
一些需要解决的事
...with a dilemma.

82
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,880
我会尽力帮忙
I'll do whatever I can to help.

83
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:46,200
这是我丈夫的私人书房
My husband's inner sanctum.

84
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,880
没有什么人曾经进入这房内
Not many people have been inside this room.

85
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:53,400
我父亲在匹兹堡钢铁场工作
My father worked the Pittsburgh mill.

86
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,880
我相信是尔稳联合钢铁
Irving United Steel, I believe.

87
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,560
但你拿到宾州大学奖学金
But you attended Penn on an academic scholarship.

88
00:08:58,800 --> 00:08:59,880
没错
That's right.

89
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,640
你同学都念法律和财经 而你选择侦探学
Peers went into law and finance, but you chose surveillance.

90
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,720
我知道那才是将来
I decided it was the future.

91
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:06,560
你丈夫是个传奇
Your husband is a legend.

92
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,920
请坐
Please.

93
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,640
我们结婚四十五年
We were married 45 years.

94
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:14,160
四个儿女七个孙子
Four children, seven grandchildren.

95
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,400
但他真正醉心的
But his true passion lay...

96
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,880
是他的工作
...in his work.

97
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,960
但他一直很忠心
But he was always loyal.

98
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,640
我非常地
I loved him...

99
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,240
深爱他
...deeply.

100
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,080
我明白
I understand.

101
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,840
丹尼
Daniel.

102
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:33,240
只有我丈夫一人知道这保险箱的密码
My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe.

103
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,080
我们请人把它打开
We had to hire somebody to open it.

104
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:37,600
我避免让任何人
I prevented anyone...

105
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,920
看保险箱内的东西
...from seeing the contents.

106
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,280
我觉得那是我丈夫的私人物品
I felt these were my husband's private things.

107
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,560
我没有…..
I didn't....

108
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:48,440
我没有察觉….
I didn't realize....

109
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,680
你想告诉我发现什么吗？
Do you want to tell me what you found?

110
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:56,320
现金股票
Cash, stock certificates.

111
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:00,800
没有什么不寻常真的除了….
Nothing out of the ordinary, really, except that.

112
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,800
一套短片
It's a film...

113
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,120
好像有个少女被杀
...where a girl appears to be murdered.

114
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,120
我不肯定我明白
I'm not sure I understand.

115
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,960
拍的很真实
It's very realistic.

116
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,480
但每天有多少人在电影或电视上
But how many people seem to be realistically killed...

117
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,480
好像真的被杀害
in movies and on TV every day?

118
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,960
开始时像一套低俗的色情电影
It begins as a relatively sleazy bit of pornography...

119
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,240
但突然变的很暴力和血腥
...and rapidly turns quite violent and bloody.

120
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,320
你所说的叫色情暴力电影
What you're talking about is called a snuff film.

121
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:35,800
据我所知 色情暴力电影是都市神话
From what I know, snuff films are an urban myth.

122
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,400
性行业的传说根本没有这回事
Sex industry folklore. There's no such thing.

123
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,480
我也这样向克里斯太太解释
That's what I explained to Mrs. Christian.

124
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,240
这可能是一些性虐待的电影
This is probably an SM film of some sort.

125
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
模拟强奸模拟暴力
Simulated rape, simulated violence.

126
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:48,920
令人倒胃口 但都是拍出来的
It's hard to stomach, but there are ways of doing it.

127
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,720
假血浆特别效果
Fake blood, special effects.

128
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:54,120
请你看完这影片后 告诉我你的意见
Would you look at the film and give us your opinion?

129
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:56,000
我只希望
All I want...

130
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,440
知道这暴行是假的
...is to know that this atrocity is false.

131
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,760
我要证据
I want the proof.

132
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:58,960
嗯….
Well...

133
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,280
拍这电影的人拍的非常传神
...whoever made the film was adept at authenticity.

134
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:06,120
我不是专家 但是我提议让警方去决定
But I'm no expert. I suggest letting the police make a determination.

135
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,280
不可能
Out of the question.

136
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,200
有几个原因说明这是不必要
That would be so unnecessary for any number of reasons...

137
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,640
不单只是为了克里斯先生的名誉
...not the least of which is Mr. Christian's reputation.

138
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
我们只想你找出拍这套影片的人
We want you to find out who made this film...

139
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,240
证实这是真是假
...and establish whether it's real.

140
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,040
你可以开个价钱
You can name your price.

141
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,040
我们会供应你买资料用的任何资源
You'll be provided with whatever you need to buy information.

142
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,320
那少女是唯一的线索
Girl's all I've got to go on.

143
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,320
我可以当它是一宗人口失踪案件
I could treat it like a missing persons case.

144
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:32,480
明白
Understood.

145
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:33,720
当然….
Of course...

146
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,640
我们要确保你不会拷贝这套影片
...we need to be assured that you would not copy this film.

147
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,720
我向你保证
You have my word on that.

148
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
我只向你汇报
But I'll be dealing directly with you...

149
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,320
只向你一个
...and only you.

150
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:45,480
你与你律师的关系如何是你的事
Your relationship with your attorney is your own.

151
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,680
-不是对你不礼貌 -不会
-No offense. -None taken.

152
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:51,160
我觉得你已经详细的考虑过
I realize you've given this careful consideration.

153
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,080
你可以毁灭它
You could have destroyed it.

154
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,920
告诉我这可怜的少女没有被杀
Tell me the poor girl wasn't killed.

155
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,440
求你
Please?

156
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,600
找到她要活着的
Find her alive.

157
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,920
我会尽力夫人
I'll do the best I can, ma'am.

158
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,200
你要去克利夫兰？
Cleveland?

159
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,400
你刚到家
You just got home.

160
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:49,400
我也希望可以留下 但这是房子的贷款
And I wish I could stay, but this is the mortgage.

161
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,120
仙蒂上大学的学费
It's Cindy's college money.

162
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,560
如果我办好这事 凭克里斯太太的社交圈子
If I do right by her, with the circle she runs in...

163
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:55,240
这会是一个难得的机会
...this could be a big break.

164
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:56,880
我不认为我们需要什么机会
I didn't know we needed a break.

165
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,160
你父亲认为我们需要
Your father seems to think we do.

166
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,000
那克里斯太太是怎样的人？
So, what was Mrs. Christian like?

167
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:08,640
就像你所想像的 我为她感到难过
Like you'd expect, I guess. I feel sorry for her.

168
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,920
那是宗人口失踪案
It's a missing persons.

169
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,920
我告诉她我会用两至三周时间
I told her I'd give it a couple, three weeks.

170
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:16,560
不该会用更多的时间 成功的机会不大
It can't take longer than that. It's an outside shot.

171
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:20,920
我只能告诉你这么多 你最好不要知道那么多
That's all I can tell you. Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.

172
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,400
常常是这样
It's always that way.

173
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,160
她醒了我去看她
She's awake. I'll get her.

174
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:28,160
好吧我很快会上去
All right, I'll be up in a sec.

175
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,120
-你带枪？ -我不需要它
-You're taking the gun? -I won't need it.

176
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:00,200
那不要带
Don't take it.

177
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:02,120
我不会用它这只是作预防
I won't wear it. It's just a precaution.

178
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,200
别担心
Don't worry.

179
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,040
你到了那里会给我打电话吗？
Will you call me when you get there, please?

180
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,960
费城的一对医生夫妇聘请我
I've been hired by a couple in Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.

181
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:29,480
几天前他们在81公路载了一名搭顺风车
A few days ago, they picked up a girl hitchhiking off 81...

182
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:31,720
约十八岁的离家出走少女
..a runaway, about 18, maybe.

183
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,320
他们请她吃饭
They buy her a meal.

184
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,800
那医生尝试劝她
The doctor tries to convince her...

185
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,240
最低限度给家里打个电话
...that, at the very least, she should call home.

186
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,000
不出意料 那女孩吃完
Not surprisingly, the girl ate, excused herself...

187
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,920
就找借口离开了
...that was the last they saw of her.

188
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,240
我有个在警局有关部门工作的朋友画了一张草图
We had a friend of mine at the department work up a sketch.

189
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,680
他们想看看我能否确认这少女
They want to see if I can ID this girl...

190
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,080
然后转告给她的父母
...then pass along a message to the parents...

191
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,400
让他们知道这孩子还活着
...letting them know the kid's alive.

192
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:56,400
你不介意我作核对？
You don't mind if I run a check?

193
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,000
请自便
Go ahead.

194
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,000
你想怎样就怎样
You want it, you got it.

195
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,440
随便找你需要的资料
Knock yourself out.

196
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:05,080
每年约有八十五万至一百万人失踪
Anywhere from 850,000 to 1,000,000 missing every year.

197
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,760
我们已尽量将资料存入电脑 其他的你就要翻看资料卡
We have as much as we can on computer, then it's the wet-thumb method.

198
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,840
档案根据失踪的州县及年份排列
Files are by state and year of disappearance.

199
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,600
我们把成年人和儿童分开
We keep children and adults separate.

200
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,200
请勿进食或吸烟
No eating or smoking.

201
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,120
-大厅有咖啡机 -味道好吗？
-The coffee machine's in the hall. -Any good?

202
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,440
很难喝
Horrible.

203
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,600
几天后它会成为你的好朋友
It'll be your best friend after a few days...

204
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:21,440
如果你撑到那么久
...if you last that long.

205
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:22,840
祝你好运
Good luck.

206
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,120
宝贝 是我
Honey, it's me.

207
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,200
你好吗？
How are you?

208
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,440
我很好
I'm good.

209
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:31,720
你在哪？
Where are you?

210
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:34,800
我还在克利夫兰仙蒂怎样？
I'm still in Cleveland. How's Cindy?

211
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,880
她很乖她在睡觉
She's sweet. She's sleeping.

212
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,880
我非常想你
I'm missing you bigtime.

213
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:41,800
我也很想你
Yeah, l miss you too.

214
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,680
我明天再打电话给你
I'll call you tomorrow.

215
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,560
好的晚安
Okay. Good night.

216
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
晚安甜心
Good night, sweetheart.

217
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,080
豪华544

218
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:34,840
喂 克里斯太太？ 汤姆·威尔斯
Hello, Mrs. Christian? Tom Welles.

219
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,320
进展是这样
Here's where we stand.

220
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,920
我查到那套影片的底片 型号是“豪华544”
l checked the film stock. It's called Supralux 544.

221
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,760
生产商在92年已经停止生产这型号的底片
The company that made that stock discontinued it in '92.

222
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,440
所以那套影片是在之前制作的
So the film was made prior to that.

223
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:49,440
我已经查得非常的仔细了
I'm probably being overly thorough with this...

224
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,800
但你可不可能找出你丈夫在六至七年前的
...but you might want to dig up your husband's financial records...

225
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:54,680
财政记录
...about 6 or 7 years ago.

226
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:57,600
看看有什么不寻常的地方
See if there's anything out of the ordinary.

227
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:01,440
很明显这不是一套你可以拿到快洗照相馆去冲洗的底片
Obviously, this isn't a movie you drop off at the one-hour photo.

228
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,520
那你认为这是唯一的拷贝
So you think it's one of a kind.

229
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,160
这个底片经过摄影机拍成的 是没有底片的
The film that went through the camera is what we've got. There's no negative.

230
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,560
不像录影带它不是可以随便复制的
Unlike video, it's not really designed to be duplicated.

231
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,920
无论如何我觉得….
Whatever this is, l have a feeling...

232
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:16,040
即使有拷贝流传 相信也不会有很多
...there aren't many copies floating around, if any.

233
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,920
我在找一个不确定是否失踪的少女
I'm looking for a girl we're not sure is missing.

234
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:22,800
发生在六七年前
With this happening 6 or 7 years ago...

235
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,880
找出制作这套影片的人
...finding the guys who made this film...

236
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,320
老实说将会是件很困难的事
...frankly, is going to be very difficult.

237
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:30,640
我知道你做得到你做得很好
l know you can do it. You're doing a wonderful job.

238
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,080
请告诉我你会继续调查
Please tell me you'll continue the investigation.

239
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,320
我会我会为你尽力去做
l will. I'll keep trying for you.

240
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,080
你可以信赖我 再见 克里斯太太
You can count on me. Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.

241
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,760
我们现在未能接听你的电话 请在讯号之后留下留言
We can't come to the phone right now, so please leave a message at the beep.

242
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,080
宝贝 是我
Honey, it's me.

243
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:49,280
对不起 我昨晚忘了打电话给你
I'm sorry I forgot to call last night.

244
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,160
我今晚不会忘记
I won't forget tonight.

245
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,200
我已经离家很久 我希望可以尽快回家
I've been gone a long time and I hope I'll be home soon.

246
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,320
我爱你 想你 今晚再谈
I love you, and I miss you. We'll talk tonight.

247
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,040
北卡罗莱纳

249
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:21,480
你找珍纳？
You looking for Janet?

250
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,080
你好 马修太太？
Hello, Mrs. Mathews?

251
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,880
我叫汤姆·贺特 我是州政府调查员
I'm Thomas Hart. I'm a state-licensed investigator.

252
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,600
我受雇于美国资源中心失踪人口部
I've been hired by the U.S. Resource Centre, Missing Persons...

253
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,440
现在做内部资料调查
..as part of an internal audit.

254
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:40,520
我想跟你约个时间
I'd like to make an appointment with you...

255
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:43,800
想问一些关于你女儿 玛丽·安的问题
...to answer questions about your daughter, Mary Anne.

256
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:48,280
我昨天跟联邦调查局的调查员….
I spoke to your FBI contact yesterday, Agent....

257
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,040
尼尔 尼尔·科尔？
Neil. Neil Cole?

258
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:54,520
对 科尔调查员 他会通知你我要来找你
Yes, Agent Cole. He told me he'd call and let you know to expect me.

259
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,600
他没有通知你？
He didn't call?

260
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:04,160
是你吗？
Is this you?

261
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:08,360
看来像五岁
You look about five years old.

262
00:22:08,840 --> 00:22:09,720
不止五岁
A little older.

263
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,120
很可爱
Sweet.

264
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,040
最重要是….
It's important that...

265
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:19,640
你不要因我这次的查问而提高你的期望
...you don't let this raise your expectations.

266
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:23,120
也不会影响任何进行中的调查
It's not going to effect any ongoing efforts.

267
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,920
我想说的是
All I'm saying is, please know that...

268
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:28,880
我不是来带给你任何虚假的希望
...I'm not here to create any false hope.

269
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:35,800
我们一直在争吵玛丽·安和我
We fought all the time, Mary Anne and me...

270
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,320
和她的继父
...and her stepdad.

271
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,160
她憎恨他
She hated him...

272
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,560
因为他不是她的生父
...because he wasn't her real dad.

273
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,240
在家里和学校制造麻烦
Trouble here, trouble at school.

274
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,560
很麻烦
Trouble.

275
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,680
不喜欢规矩像我一样
Didn't like rules. Takes after me, I guess.

276
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,240
我从痛苦中学习
I had to learn the hard way.

277
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,600
我可以和你丈夫谈谈？
Can I speak to your husband?

278
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:57,760
她的继父？
Her stepfather?

279
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,080
大伟？
Dave?

280
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,600
死了
Gone.

281
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,320
是玛丽·安离家后两年
Two years after Mary Anne left.

282
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:06,840
她一直恨他
All the time, she resented him.

283
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,840
我因为他而失去她 然后我又失去他
I lost her because of him, and then I lost him.

284
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,680
现在只剩下我一个
I'm the only one still here.

285
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,920
玛丽·安有男朋友吗？
Did Mary have a boyfriend?

286
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,760
她有偷偷地和男孩子外出
She was sneaking out with someone.

287
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:22,120
她不会告诉我
She wouldn't tell me who.

288
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:25,760
满身吻痕的回家向我说谎
Coming home with hickeys, lying all the time.

289
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,880
我很抱歉向你提出 但在这种情况下
I am sorry to bring this up, but in these circumstances...

290
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:32,800
加上有继父
...with the stepfather....

291
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:36,200
有没有任何被性侵犯的迹像？
Were there any indications of any sort of abuse?

292
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,360
完全没有 警方和联邦调查局都问过
There was nothing like that. The police and FBI asked.

293
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,640
没有这种事发生过从来没有
Nothing happened like that. Never.

294
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,960
如果有她会告诉我
She'd have told me.

295
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,720
对不起 我不得不问
I apologize. I had to ask.

296
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,400
都是给她庆祝生日的 自从她离开后每年一份
Those are for her birthday. One for every year she missed.

297
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:54,320
都在等她回来
They'll be waiting for her when she comes back.

298
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,320
那是因为我打她巴掌
It's because I slapped her.

299
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,240
我知道
I know.

300
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:07,240
我们为了大卫吵架她激怒了我
We was fighting about Dave, and she was just pushing my buttons.

301
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,880
我便打她巴掌
And I slapped her.

302
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:12,000
天啊！
Jesus.

303
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,840
第二天她便走了
Next day, she was gone.

304
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,840
当孩子出走 他们几乎都会留下字条
When kids run, they almost always leave a note.

305
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,240
通常都会感到内疚
It's guilt, usually.

306
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,080
没有字条
There wasn't one.

307
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,680
警方查看过
Police looked.

308
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:26,400
诱拐和出走是两回事
An abduction's one thing, a runaway's another.

309
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:30,000
有时候离家出走都不是警方优先处理的案件
Sometimes it's not the priority for the police it should be.

310
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:34,440
没有留下任何东西 你不认为我会希望有吗？
There wasn't anything. Don't you think I wish there was?

311
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:37,360
你或许对但你会让我看看吗？
You're probably right, but would you let me look?

312
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:40,760
你告诉我….
You tell me...

313
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,080
不要存有太大希望
...not to get my hopes up...

314
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:46,680
也不要期望过高
...not to raise my expectations.

315
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,120
请自便
Go ahead.

316
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:54,120
我想喝点东西
I need a drink.

317
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:56,600
谢谢
Thank you.

318
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,880
亲爱的妈妈 假如你在看这信
Dear Mom: lf you're reading this...

319
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,200
大概是因为 我从加州的好莱坞打电话来
...it probably means l called you from Hollywood, California.

320
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:54,560
我留下日记 是因为我想让你知道 我为什么离开
l left my diary behind because l want you to see why I'm leaving.

321
00:26:54,800 --> 00:26:56,400
不是因为你打我
It's not because you hit me.

322
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,800
我藏起这信 是不想让大卫这王八蛋找到
l hid this so Dave the dickhead wouldn't find it.

323
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,160
我和华伦·安迪生相爱
Warren Anderson and me are in love.

324
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,640
我要和他开始新生活
I'm going to start a whole new life with him.

325
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,800
华伦的父亲在镇上拥有一间车行
Warren's dad owns that garage in town.

326
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:09,880
但华伦有更大的志愿
But Warren has even bigger plans.

327
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
华伦要成为动作电影的巨星
Warren'll become a star in action movies.

328
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,080
他说我比很多电影里的女孩都漂亮
He says I'm prettier than a lot of girls in movies.

329
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,640
我也会成为巨星
I could be a star too.

330
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:18,480
要喝什么？
You want a drink?

331
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,480
当我们驶进好莱坞
When we cruise into Hollywood...

332
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:25,320
人人都感觉到我的眼睛在放光 因为我在恋爱中
...I'll have fiery eyes that everyone will notice, because l am in love.

333
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,400
你对我找不到任何资料
You were right. I didn't find anything.

334
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:32,600
为你准备了饮料
Fixed you a drink.

335
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:35,240
不 谢了 我还有工作要做
Thanks, no. I've got work to do.

336
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,320
我明天晚上再来
I'll stop by tomorrow night.

337
00:27:38,360 --> 00:27:40,920
当你看这信时 我们可能已结婚了
We'll probably be married by the time you read this.

338
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,680
不要来找我 因为我不会回去
Don't come looking for me, because I'm not coming back.

339
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,600
或者有一天 你会在电视或杂志上看到我
Maybe someday you'll see me on TV or in magazines.

340
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:52,040
不要担心我 爱你的玛丽·安
Don't worry about me. Love, Mary Anne.

341
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,120
安迪生先生？
Mr. Anderson?

342
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:57,360
哪一位？
Who's asking?

343
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,360
汤姆·哈特 抱歉不能跟你握手
Tom Hart. Excuse me not shaking hands.

344
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,440
我想找你儿子 你有个儿子叫华伦 对吧？
I'm looking for your son. You've got a son named Warren, right?

345
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:05,880
对
Sure.

346
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,280
有什么事？
What's it about?

347
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:09,640
你是警察？
You a cop?

348
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:10,800
不是
No, sir.

349
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:14,640
是他一位老朋友 其实是欠了他一点钱
Just a friend from a while back. Owe him some money, actually.

350
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:17,040
你欠了他钱？
You owe him money?

351
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,640
这个倒新鲜
That's a new one.

352
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:22,960
如果你愿意你可以把钱交给我
You can leave it right here if you want.

353
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,560
假如你不介意 我想寄给他
If it's all the same, I'd like to send it to him.

354
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,560
加利福尼亚州对不对？
California, right?

355
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,800
加利福尼亚州？
California?

356
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:36,400
小子 你知道费亦威利监狱在哪里吗？
Son, you know where the Fayetteville lockup is?

357
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,880
华伦就在那里
That's where Warren is.

358
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,560
八个月的服刑期入屋行窃罪
Doing eight months on a B and E.

359
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,080
谢谢
Thank you.

360
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,560
唔 我认识她
Yeah, man, I knew her.

361
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:55,400
在我去洛杉矶之前 已经把那贱人甩了
Dumped that bitch right before I moved to L.A.

362
00:28:55,920 --> 00:28:58,920
她来敲我门 像个他妈的贼婆娘
She shows up knocking at my door like a fucking stalker.

363
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,600
我叫那贱妇去死
Told that bitch she could go to hell.

364
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,920
她去了哪里？
Where'd she go?

365
00:29:06,840 --> 00:29:08,440
可能是地狱
Hell, maybe.

366
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,160
我不知道 也没兴趣知道
I don't know and I don't give a fuck either.

367
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:16,600
她说她可能去脱衣舞酒吧工作
She said she might work at a titty bar or something.

368
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:19,680
其实她的胸并不迷人
Ask me, her tits weren't all that great.

369
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,200
你有再见她吗？
Did you hear from her again?

370
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:28,520
不要以为我干了她 就想让她跟我去好莱坞
Just because I was fucking her doesn't mean I wanted her out there.

371
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:32,440
她想在好莱坞成为巨星
She came to Hollywood to be a big fucking movie star.

372
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,360
我也一样
And so did I.

373
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,680
这就是现在的我
Check me out now.

374
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,040
为什么不给我一支烟？
Why don't you pass me one of them smokes?

375
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,200
我不吸烟
I don't smoke.

376
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,040
你好吗？
How you doing?

377
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,400
还可以
I'm okay.

378
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,400
你听起来不是很好
You don't sound okay.

379
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:02,560
事情并不简单
It's not easy.

380
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,040
为什么？发生什么事
Why? What's going on?

381
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,080
只是比我想像的更困难
It's tougher than I thought it would be, that's all.

382
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,560
是不是很辛苦？
Is it getting to you?

383
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,480
但我已有线索 不能放弃
l got a lead l can't drop.

384
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,720
我差不多完成了 想你
I'm almost done. I miss you.

385
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,480
我也想你 爱你
I miss you too. I love you.

386
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,240
替我亲一下仙蒂？
Give Cindy a kiss for me, okay?

387
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,720
等一下 她要跟你说再见 跟爹地说再见
Wait, I think she wants to say bye. Say bye to Daddy.

388
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,480
嗨 甜心
Hi, sweetie.

389
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:22,640
嗨 宝贝 
Hi, honey.

390
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,080
嗨 仙蒂
Hi, Cinderella.

391
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,680
她正在摸电话
She's touching the phone.

392
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,240
你应该看看 她听见你声音时的表情
You should see her face at your voice.

393
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:31,840
我爱你
I love you.

394
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:34,400
我也爱你 再见
I love you too. Bye.

395
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
我正在做晚餐
I was just making dinner.

396
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:42,280
不知不觉地做了两人的份量
I've made enough for two, as it happens.

397
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,440
对不起 我不能留下
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

398
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:48,280
我只想让你知道 我跟我的人谈过
I wanted to let you know I spoke to my people at the agency.

399
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,520
我叫他们继续调查玛丽·安的案件
I told them to keep Mary Anne's case active.

400
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,120
那么…
Well...

401
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:58,120
起码 喝点东西吧
...stay for a drink, at least.

402
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:03,600
你确定不饿？
You sure you're not hungry?

403
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:06,880
偶尔吃一顿不看电视的晚餐也不错
It'd be nice to have a meal without the TV on for once.

404
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,360
我要开长途车
I have a long drive ahead of me.

405
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,520
一个人吃晚餐是最令人沮丧的事
It's one of the most depressing things. Eating alone.

406
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,880
我不知道为什么 你以为我应该已经习惯了
I don't know why. You'd think I'd be used to it by now.

407
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,320
马修太太
Mrs. Mathews?

408
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,720
珍纳
Janet.

409
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,640
你从来有没有想过
Do you ever consider....

410
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:36,960
有没有想过玛丽可能永远不回来了？
Do you realize that Mary may never come back?

411
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,560
我每天都在想
I think about it every day.

412
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,800
每一次电话响
Every time the phone rings...

413
00:31:43,080 --> 00:31:46,400
每一次我都以为是她
...every time, I still think it's her.

414
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:49,400
她是我唯一所想的
She's all I think about.

415
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:52,840
你能告诉我
Can you tell me...

416
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:57,480
假如你要作出抉择 假如一定要你选择
...if you had to make a choice, if you were forced to choose...

417
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:01,400
一是幻想她在外面某处
...between imagining her out there somewhere...

418
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:04,760
过着很好的生活很快乐
...living a good life, being happy...

419
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,840
但你不知道
...but you don't know...

420
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,360
永远不会知道
...you never find out...

421
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,920
或是最坏的事实
...or the worst being true...

422
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,360
她已死了
...her being gone...

423
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,280
但你知道
...but you know.

424
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,840
你终于知道
You finally know...

425
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:25,000
她发生什么事
...what's happened to her.

426
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,360
我会怎样选？
What would I choose?

427
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,680
对
Yes.

428
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
我会选择去知道
I would choose to know.

429
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
我需要知道
I need to know.

430
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:51,120
对不起 我想借用你的洗手间
Excuse me, I have to use your restroom.

431
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,680
你要走了
You're leaving.

432
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,280
如果我有任何发现 我会通知你
I'll call you if I find anything out.

433
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,560
好莱坞

434
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,800
脱衣舞娘

435
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,680
成人书店

436
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:38,400
你好吗？
How you doing?

437
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,600
今晚有约会？
Big date tonight?

438
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,160
嗯 有可能
Yeah, guess so.

439
00:36:43,360 --> 00:36:46,120
有没有兴趣看一个电动阴道？
Could I interest you in a battery-operated vagina?

440
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,920
很诱惑 但是不用了 谢谢
It's tempting, but no thanks.

441
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:52,600
我不想看到当你需要一个电动阴道
I'd hate to see you caught in one of those everyday situations...

442
00:36:52,840 --> 00:36:56,120
而你没有的情况
...that calls for a battery-operated vagina and you don't have one.

443
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,680
我宁愿冒个险
I'll risk it.

444
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:02,200
没问题 一共是七十四元五毛八
All right, your total is $74.58 please.

445
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:07,200
一百元
A hundred.

446
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,120
二十五元和零钱
Total's $25 and some change.

447
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,280
多谢你在成人书店购物
I'd like to thank you for shopping at Adult Bookstore.

448

祝你有精彩的一天
And have yourself a fabulous day.

449
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,880
你在看什么？
What are you reading?

450
00:37:27,720 --> 00:37:28,800
后庭花

451
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,480
很讨好的书名 你真正在看的是什么书？
Catchy title. What are you really reading?

452
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,720
很难相信这本书有任何值得强调的部份
Hard to believe it's got any parts worth highlighting.

453
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,000
冷血杀戮

454
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,720
卡波特
Capote.

455
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:42,960
你知道是怎样
You know how it is.

456
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:47,000
你不想在顾客面前令自己尴尬
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself in front of your fellow perverts.

457
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:51,320
没错 我会被色情行业协会轰走
I might get drummed out of the pornographers' union.

458
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:53,000
那我靠什么生活？
Where would I be then?

459
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,760
祝今天愉快
Have a good day.

460
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:13,600
性爱不设防 性爱最过瘾

461
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:26,760
嗨 你好吗？
How are you?

462
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,440
嗨 宝贝 
Hey, honey.

463
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,680
-你好吗？ -我有一点累
-How you doing? -I'm a little beat.

464
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:31,720
仙蒂怎样？
How's Cindy?

465
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,840
她很乖 她想念你
She's sweet. She misses you.

466
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,600
进展如何？
How's it going?

467
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:39,600
调查并不算很顺利 我现在只想着回家
The way things are going, I'm thinking about coming home.

468
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:40,960
真的？
Really?

469
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,960
宝贝 等一等
Honey, wait.

470
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:48,400
我再打给你好吗？
Can I call you back?

471
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,800
我答应马上打给你 再见 宝贝 
I'll call you right back, l promise. Bye, honey.

472
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:36,080
克里斯太太 一共有三个人
Mrs. Christian, there were 3 men.

473
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,920
不单是那摄影师和戴面具的人
Not just the cameraman and the masked man.

474
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:42,440
我发现有第三个人在看
l caught a glimpse of a third man. He was watching.

475
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:46,760
我用电脑做一个比较清晰的影像
I'll try to get a clearer image through computer enhancement.

476
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,160
但这可能发生在六年前的事 所以并不是….
But this probably happened 6 years ago, so it's not--

477
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,280
好的 我会尽力
All right, I'll keep trying.

478
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,440
谢谢 谢谢你的支持
Thank you. l appreciate your support.

479
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,440
再见
Goodbye.

480
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:59,600
经过我们137个小时的工作
What we have here is 137 billable man-hours...

481
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,440
加上一部超过十万元的机器
...a hundred-plus thousand dollars machine...

482
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,200
得到的结果就是
...and the result is a...

483
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,280
一个放大了的男人头的背后
...fully rasterised enhancement of the back of some guy's head.

484
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:10,680
要不要裱起它？
Want it framed?

485
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,520
好的 祝你好运
There you go. Have a nice day.

486
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:19,520
这里像加油站 加油前要先付款
It's like a gas station, you pay before you pump.

487
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,040
记得我吗？
Remember me?

488
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,480
回来买那电动阴道吗
Came back for the battery-operated vagina after all.

489
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,800
我想要一些资料 也许你能帮忙
I need information. Maybe you could help.

490
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,880
托马斯·威尔斯 照片很漂亮
Thomas Welles. Nice picture.

491
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:37,800
哪一种资料？因为我有各方面的
What sort of information? Because I got all different kinds.

492
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,200
我会付钱的那种
The kind I'll pay for.

493
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:42,480
我不知道你在找哪一种….
I don't know what you're looking for...

494
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:44,880
先说清楚 我不是同性恋
...so we're clear from the start, I'm straight.

495
00:40:45,080 --> 00:40:46,240
恭喜你
Congratulations.

496
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,520
谢谢
Thank you.

497
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,800
拉上拉链！
Zip it!

498
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,320
我可以提供资料
I can hook you up.

499
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,400
你说出要我做的 我给你报价
You name the vice, I name the price.

500
00:40:53,180 --> 00:40:54,500
你在这里工作了多久？
How long you been working here?

501
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:56,420
大约两年
Almost two years.

502
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,860
你叫什么名字？如果你不介意我问
What's your name, if you don't mind me asking?

503
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,500
麦克斯
Max.

504
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:02,860
这是我们的交易
Here's the deal.

505
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,940
我正在调查有关地下色情行业
This thing I'm on now has to do
with underground pornography.

506
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:08,940
非法在台底交易的那种东西
Stuff that's sold under
the counter, illegally.

507
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,340
没有什么非法的东西
There's not much illegal out there.

508
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:15,180
不管有多少
我都要知道要查清楚
Whatever there is, I want to know.
I want a good look.

509
00:41:15,340 --> 00:41:19,020
如果你有这些门路很好
如果没有请你立刻说
So if you've got that kind of
connection, great. If not, speak now.

510
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:21,020
你是警察？
You're not a cop, are you?

511
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:23,540
如果你是你必须告诉我
If I ask and you are,
you got to tell me.

512
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,220
我不是警察
I'm not a cop.

513
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:27,380
私家侦探？
A private detective?

514
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,020
像夏飞特？
Like Shaft?

515
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,580
有否看过私家真棒？
我有减价发售
You ever seen Private Dicks?
I got it on sale.

516
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,460
你在这里赚多少钱？
How much you make in there?

517
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:40,460
约四百元一个星期不用交税
Around 400 bucks a week,
off the books.

518
00:41:40,660 --> 00:41:42,980
假设我生活在
与你相同的幻想世界
Let's pretend I live
in the same fantasy world...

519
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:45,340
而你在这垃圾地方
每星期赚四百元
...where you make ＄400
a week in that dump.

520
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:47,820
我给你五百元工作几天
I'll give you 500 for a few days.

521
00:41:47,980 --> 00:41:49,260
六百吧阿伯
Six sounds good, Pops.

522
00:41:49,500 --> 00:41:50,660
五百
Five.

523
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:53,940
这是我的电话号码
Here's my number.

524
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,700
你何时可以开始？
When can you start?

525
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:02,900
嗯明天晚上我很晚下班
Well, tomorrow night I get off late.

526
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,900
明天见
Tomorrow.

527
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,980
好吧
All right.

528
00:42:06,180 --> 00:42:09,140
不要叫我阿伯
And don't call me Pops.

529
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:13,060
当然我不想伤害你的感情
Of course not. I wouldn't
want to hurt your feelings.

530
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,420
我不知道你的性趣
Look, l don't know
what your scene is.

531
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:19,500
你可能和其他人一样喜欢色情
You may like porn
as much as the next guy.

532
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:21,940
但你不太像一般喜欢这玩意的人
But you don't look
like your average sleaze.

533
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:23,420
反而像个警察
More like your average fucking cop.

534
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:28,180
所以当你问及那些
非法的东西的时候
So when you ask people about fucking
illegal stuff, it has a certain...

535
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,420
你有种特别的神情
...patina to it.

536
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:30,580
神情
Patina.

537
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,820
那是卡波特词语
懂吗？
It's a Truman Capote word.
Hello?

538
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:34,900
如果从没人看过
或卖过这类电影
If someone never saw
or sold a snuff film...

539
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,860
他们不会在乎我问什么
...they shouldn't care
what I ask.

540
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:39,020
如果他们有就会比较紧张
If they have,
they should be nervous.

541
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:41,900
只要你觉得谁有嫌疑
不要放弃
Whoever acts insulted,
keep knocking on their door.

542
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:46,060
这阿伯现在改变初衷
还不是太迟
Look, Pops, it's not too late
to change your mind about all this.

543
00:42:46,260 --> 00:42:49,100
你将会见到一些
你不忘记的东西
There's things you're going
to see that you can't unsee.

544
00:42:49,380 --> 00:42:50,940
会让你印象很深刻
They get in your head and stay there.

545
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,700
你怎知道我看过什么？
How do you know what I've seen?

546
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,220
那很好但每个人都有他的极限
Okay, fine.
But everybody's got their limit.

547
00:42:56,380 --> 00:42:59,900
我在这里呆了他妈的六年
尝试发展我的音乐事业
I've been here 6 fucking years
trying to get my music together.

548
00:43:00,180 --> 00:43:03,700
所以我开始兼职以维持生计
So I start part-time
where I work to make ends meet.

549
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:07,380
一晃眼几年光景过去
我仍是老样子
And boom, a couple years go by,
and here I am.

550
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:11,300
只是说在你发觉以前
你已经成为这行业的一份子
I'm just saying, before you know it,
you're in it. Deep in it.

551
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:13,180
别为我担心
Don't worry about me.

552
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:14,380
谢谢你
But thank you.

553
00:43:14,540 --> 00:43:16,300
别客气
You're welcome.

554
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:19,900
阿伯你在和魔鬼共舞
魔鬼不会改变
Pops, you dance with the devil,
the devil don't change.

555
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:21,980
魔鬼会改变你
Devil changes you.

556
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,660
你歌词的部份？
Some of your lyrics?

557
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:24,740
很好笑
That's cute.

558
00:43:36,100 --> 00:43:38,180
这地方已存在约有三年
This place has been around
about 3 years...

559
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:40,660
但他们不断搬来搬去
...but they keep moving it
house to house.

560
00:43:57,260 --> 00:43:59,180
这只是一小部份
This is the tip of the iceberg.

561
00:43:59,420 --> 00:44:02,260
有很多墨西哥性虐待
有很多亚洲性奴
Lots of Mexican S & M,
lots of Asian bondage...

562
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:05,020
各种的兽行如果你有兴趣的话
...all kinds of bestiality,
if you're into that.

563
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,020
别碰任何东西
想要什么告诉飞弟
Don't touch nothing.
You want something, tell Friendly.

564
00:44:08,340 --> 00:44:09,420
问他看看？
Ask him.

565
00:44:21,940 --> 00:44:23,100
别这样！
Don't do that!

566
00:44:23,460 --> 00:44:24,780
好了！没事！
All right! It's cool!

567
00:44:26,780 --> 00:44:27,980
没问题？
All right? Okay.

568
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,780
走吧好的
Come on, let's go.
All right!

569
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:45,220
你是不是一个法律执行人
或与法律执行有关？
Are you a law enforcement agent
or affillated with law enforcement?

570
00:44:45,460 --> 00:44:46,780
操你赖瑞
Fuck you, Larry.

571
00:44:47,020 --> 00:44:51,060
你是否一个法律执行人
或与法律执行有关？
Are you a law enforcement agent,
or affillated with law enforcement?

572
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:52,500
操你赖瑞
Fuck you, Lar.

573
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:54,620
你越来越上道了威尔斯
You're getting cool there, Welles.

574
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:58,660
这里有你那色情电影的怪人
卖那些烫手货的人
You got your porn zombies here.
Junkies for the hard stuff.

575
00:44:58,820 --> 00:45:01,060
但这种地下室销售不会维持很久
But these basement sales
won't last much longer.

576
00:45:01,300 --> 00:45:03,460
一太冒险
二所有东西都上网
One, it's too risky.
And two, everything's on the Net.

577
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,980
嫖客在网上交换照片
Chicken hawks swapping photos
with their modems.

578
00:45:06,140 --> 00:45:09,820
分类广告有密码
Then there's classified ads
with hidden codes, secret couriers...

579
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:12,060
由假的公司秘密递送
...wires through dummy corporations.

580
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:15,500
有什么不合法的
顾客都跑得远远的
If something's illegal, the buyers
are as far away as they can get.

581
00:45:15,700 --> 00:45:18,660
大家互不认识你明白我说什么
Nobody knows what nobody knows,
you know what I mean?

582
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:20,500
你好吗山美？
How's it going, Samuel?

583
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,740
我去跟她打招呼
I'm going to say hi to her.

584
00:45:27,340 --> 00:45:29,180
你好吗？我喜欢
How are you? I love that.

585
00:45:29,340 --> 00:45:32,020
是有拉链的麦克杰克森像
It's the Michael Jackson look,
with the zippers.

586
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,860
儿童

587
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:05,780
这是什么？
What are these?

588
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,540
极度性奴
Extreme bondage.

589
00:46:08,860 --> 00:46:10,460
强奸电影
Rape films.

590
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:13,060
恶心到极点
Sick shit.

591
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:16,060
买五送一
Buy five, get one for free.

592
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:19,380
有没有更精彩的？
Anything harder?

593
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,900
没有更精彩的
There's nothing harder.

594
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:23,820
色情暴力电影？
Snuff?

595
00:46:26,740 --> 00:46:29,220
没有这种电影
There's no such thing as snuff.

596
00:46:29,740 --> 00:46:31,900
先生你看到的就是我所有的
What you see is what I got, mister.

597
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:34,220
我在哪里可以找到？
我有很多钱
Do you know where I can get some?
I have a lot of money.

598
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:36,060
操你
Fuck off.

599
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:25,540
就是她
There she is.

600
00:47:25,780 --> 00:47:28,780
就是她“重掴桃乐菲”
It's Double Slap Dorothy.

601
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:31,380
这个女人可以成为垒球员
There's one chick that
could be a baseball player.

602
00:47:31,620 --> 00:47:33,460
她的臂力很惊人
The swing on her is unreal.

603
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:38,140
有些色情暴力电影
是界乎于三级片与暴力之间
Some of these S & M and bondage films
you'll see straddle the line.

604
00:47:38,300 --> 00:47:40,060
恋足狂集体性交
Foot fetish, orgies, shit films...

605
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:42,900
雌雄同体伤残
比三级片更精彩
...hermaphrodites, mutilation.
It's harder than hard-core.

606
00:47:43,060 --> 00:47:44,300
但大部份是合法
But mostly legal.

607
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,380
阴茎
Stick.

608
00:47:45,620 --> 00:47:46,980
有人见到觉得呕心
One guy sees it and pukes.

609
00:47:47,140 --> 00:47:50,140
有人见到却爱到死
Another guy sees it
and he falls in love.

610
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:54,140
这是我跟你提的那个人
你有带子吗？
This is the guy I was telling you about.
You got the tapes?

611
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,460
一千元
A thousand bucks.

612
00:47:56,660 --> 00:47:58,980
-一千二佰元两盒
-你对麦克斯说一千
-1 200 for the two.
-You told Max 1 000.

613
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,500
我知道但这个更有趣
我抬高价钱你就会不爽
I know, but this is more fun. I raise
the price, and you get pissed off.

614
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,140
-我以为我们已经说好
-那是真的吗？
-I thought we had a relationship.
-Is it real?

615
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:09,140
从来没见过这样恶心的
Sickest shit you'll ever see.

616
00:48:14,180 --> 00:48:15,180
是真的吗？
Is that real?

617
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,660
看起来他妈的是真的
That sure as shit looks real.

618
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,020
她没有了呼吸
She's not breathing.

619
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,860
这影片是谁制作？
Who makes these films?

620
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,500
我不知道
I don't know.

621
00:48:40,860 --> 00:48:42,860
好像是菲律宾人
Looks like the Philippines.

622
00:48:47,860 --> 00:48:50,340
对肯定是菲律宾人
Yeah, definitely the Philippines.

623
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,060
等等是同一个女孩
Wait a minute.
That's the same girl.

624
00:49:16,220 --> 00:49:17,700
是同一个女孩吗？
Isn't that the same girl?

625
00:49:18,060 --> 00:49:19,140
看
Look.

626
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:22,060
是同一个女孩
It is the same.

627
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:23,380
那是假的
They're fakes.

628
00:49:25,980 --> 00:49:27,660
真棒
That's great.

629
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:32,500
残杀2：重生
Snuff 2: The Resurrection.

630
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,140
我的天
Oh, boy.

631
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:36,980
付1200元你期望什么？
Well, what do you expect for 1 200?

632
00:49:39,740 --> 00:49:42,260
你想喝点啤酒或什么？
我想喝点酒精饮料
You want a beer or something?
I could use anything.

633
00:49:43,900 --> 00:49:47,180
对不起我要告诉你
色情暴力电影是不存在的
But I'm sorry, man.
I told you snuff was bogus.

634
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,180
我希望我有替你拿收据
I just wish I would have
gotten you a receipt.

635
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,980

''Max California.''

637
00:49:54,740 --> 00:49:56,740
那是我以前的乐队
That's my old band.

638
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,340
我们已拆伙了
We broke up.

639
00:49:58,500 --> 00:49:59,580
什么时候？
When?

640
00:49:59,940 --> 00:50:01,740
大约一年前
Maybe about a year ago.

641
00:50:03,100 --> 00:50:05,420
我不是想侮辱你
I don't mean any offense...

642
00:50:05,580 --> 00:50:08,260
但你在这行业里混什么？
...but what are you doing
mixed up in all this?

643
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:11,940
我并没有在混什么阿伯
I'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.

644
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:14,940
你让我觉得你很聪明
可以做其他的事
You strike me as being smart enough
to do something else.

645
00:50:15,620 --> 00:50:16,860
谢谢
Thanks.

646
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:19,620
我希望你拥有一间唱片公司
I wish you owned a record label.

647
00:50:20,340 --> 00:50:22,940
起码比在加油站工作好得多
Look, it beats pumping gas.

648
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:26,020
但自己不买也不赞同
I don't buy it.
I don't endorse it.

649
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,100
我只是指点客人迷津
I just point the way.

650
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,100
但你说这让你沮丧
You said it gets to you.

651
00:50:31,380 --> 00:50:32,700
嗯该死的可以这么说！
Well, hell, yeah!

652
00:50:32,940 --> 00:50:35,380
我每天看到多少痞子？
Parade of losers I see every day?

653
00:50:35,620 --> 00:50:37,460
我有什么选择？
What choices have I got?

654
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:41,780
音乐界并没有真正敲我的门
The music industry is not exactly
beating down my door.

655
00:50:42,860 --> 00:50:45,700
你呢汤威尔斯？
And what about you, Tom Welles?

656
00:50:46,060 --> 00:50:49,460
你戴有戒指你有小孩？
You got a ring on your finger.
You got kids?

657
00:50:49,900 --> 00:50:51,140
一个女儿
A daughter.

658
00:50:52,900 --> 00:50:55,140
那你有一位太太和一个女儿
So you got a wife and a daughter...

659

和一间不错的小黄屋

660
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,460
和一只狗
...and a dog named Shep.

661
00:50:59,820 --> 00:51:02,140
那你在这里做什么？
What the hell are you doing here?

662
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,500
问得好
Good question.

663
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,340
你在像今晚的地方
感到兴奋吗？
Do you get turned on
at places like tonight?

664
00:51:13,260 --> 00:51:14,500
我没有
No, I am not.

665
00:51:14,820 --> 00:51:16,980
你也不会完全没感觉
You don't exactly
get turned off, either.

666
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,500
魔鬼已经在改变你
Devil's changing you already.

667
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,580
晚安麦克斯
Good night, Max.

668
00:51:53,020 --> 00:51:54,940
收容所

669
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:06,220
这位先生想问有没有人
认得这位少女
This gentleman was asking if anyone
recognizes this girl.

670
00:52:08,220 --> 00:52:09,380
我记得
Yes.

671
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:11,060
她是玛丽·安
I remember Mary.

672
00:52:11,220 --> 00:52:13,060
玛丽·安马修？
Mary Anne Mathews?

673
00:52:14,460 --> 00:52:18,300
如果没有记错她在这里住了
大概一个月
She lived here for only about a month,
if I recall correctly.

674
00:52:18,540 --> 00:52:22,380
有个晚上她没有回来
你知道她发生什么事？
She didn't return one night.
Do you know what happened to her?

675
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:25,620
还不知道我现在为她母亲在找她
Not yet, but I'm looking
into it for her parents.

676
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:28,580
请你把那有花的箱子拿下来？
Could you get
that flowered one down for me?

677
00:52:29,220 --> 00:52:30,580
这是她的箱子
That's her suitcase.

678
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:33,980
我已经忘记了
直到你给我看她的照片
I'd forgotten about it
till you showed me her picture.

679
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,740
我希望她会回来
I suppose I always
hoped she'd be back.

680
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,820
她好像很迷失
She seemed so lost.

681
00:52:41,060 --> 00:52:44,820
之后我只能祈祷
她有更好的出路
After a time, all I could do was pray
she'd moved on to better things.

682
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:47,060
你能把这个拿给她的家人吗？
Can you get this suitcase
to her people?

683
00:52:47,260 --> 00:52:48,580
如果适当的话
If it's approprlate.

684
00:52:48,740 --> 00:52:50,260
当然没问题谢谢你
Yes, of course. Thank you.

685
00:53:35,540 --> 00:53:37,620
星光闪闪星光亮
Starlight, star bright

686
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,540
今晚我看到的第一颗星
First star I've seen tonight

687
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:41,940
我希望我可以希望我可能

我刚接到个电话
Look, l just got a phone call.

749
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:28,900
我们要谈谈
但不方便在电话里谈
We got to talk.
And we can't talk on the phone.

750
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:32,060
所以我们其中一个需要坐上飞机
So one of us
has to get on a plane, all right?

751
01:01:32,220 --> 01:01:35,220
去你的你这神经过敏的疯子
Blow me, you paranoid fuck.

752

通常透过性杂志封底订购

伟域会受托拍电影的
He's told me Velvet will do
commissions if there's enough dough.

767
01:02:30,260 --> 01:02:32,180
刚好在合法与不合法的边缘
Nothing illegal, but borderline.

768
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:35,380
如果有人想看一个穿潜水衣

If a guy wants to see
a transvestite in a rubber suit--

769
01:02:35,620 --> 01:02:36,780

你会需要我
You'll need me.

776
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:52,700
我认识这人范炽
他不仅是伟域电影迷那么简单
This guy I know, Frenchie, is more
than just a fan of Velvet films.

777
01:02:52,980 --> 01:02:54,620
如果你想我可以带你去
I could get you in if you want.

778
01:02:55,300 --> 01:02:56,700
当然要多点钱

781
01:03:06,460 --> 01:03:07,980

哗这是我第一次来纽约
Man, my first time in
the Big Bad Apple.

不要拍我
I told you, don't film me.

784
01:03:17,220 --> 01:03:19,820
好霍华休斯
Fine, Howard Hughes.

785
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:32,340
你没告诉我会这样豪华
You didn't say it was going to be
this luxurious.

786
01:03:32,580 --> 01:03:33,580
这是总统套房
It's the Presidential suite.

787
01:03:33,740 --> 01:03:35,740
你有令人舒服的幽默感
You have a comforting
sense of humour.

788
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:37,860
我在隔壁几间房
I'll be a couple of doors down.

789
01:03:38,020 --> 01:03:41,020
汤姆我不知为什么要住
这种廉价旅馆
Tom, I don't know why
we're staying in this fleabag.

790
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,500
在廉价旅馆
人们才不会管闲事
People mind
their own business in fleabags.

791
01:03:43,660 --> 01:03:46,940
我现在出去一会
你找一下伟域的录影带
I'm going out. Dig up
whatever Velvet tapes you can find.

792
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:47,940
拿收据
Get receipts.

793
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,620

Yes, sir.

794
01:03:51,860 --> 01:03:54,860
我丈夫有五个现金户口
My husband had
five cash accounts he used.

795
01:03:55,020 --> 01:03:56,620
在1992年
Between November...

796
01:03:56,860 --> 01:03:58,540
十一月
...of 1 992...

797
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:00,540
到1993年的
...and March...

798
01:04:00,780 --> 01:04:03,020
三月之间
...of 1 993...

799
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:07,020
他从每一个户口
开出一张现金支票
...he wrote one check
out to cash from each account.

800
01:04:08,300 --> 01:04:11,460
我丈夫从来不亲自处理钱的事
My husband never dealt with money
personally.

801
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:13,300
尤其是现金
Certainly not cash.

802
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:16,380
这五张支票的总数很惊人
These checks he wrote
are for very odd amounts.

803
01:04:16,540 --> 01:04:17,860
全部加起来
When totaled together...

804
01:04:18,140 --> 01:04:19,780
这五张支票
...the five checks...

805
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:22,300
从五个不同的户口提取了
...from the five different accounts...

806
01:04:22,540 --> 01:04:24,900
总共一百万
...they equal ＄1 million.

807
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:27,700
克里斯太太那很有趣
That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.

808
01:04:27,900 --> 01:04:29,980
我提及这是因为
I only mentioned this because...

809
01:04:30,220 --> 01:04:33,220
你叫我看看有什么
不寻常的地方
...you asked me to look
for anything unusual.

810
01:04:33,460 --> 01:04:35,980
我现在剩下五千元现金
I've got about ＄5,000 left in cash.

811
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:39,900
如果你批准我跟你提出的计划
我还需要五万元
I'll need another 50, if you approve
the plan I mentioned earlier.

812
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:43,740
我快可辨认出那戴面具
男人的身份了
I'm very close to establishing
the identity of the man in the mask.

813
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:46,140
我会叫朗先生安排
I'll have Mr. Longdale arrange it.

814
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,060
怎样交给你？
How will l get it to you?

815
01:04:48,340 --> 01:04:50,500
如果你有笔我给你地址
If you have a pen,
I'll give you the address.

816
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:54,180
欢迎来到帝诺伟域的世界
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

817
01:05:26,340 --> 01:05:29,860
欢迎来到帝诺伟域的世界
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

818
01:05:57,620 --> 01:06:00,300
他是谁？戴面具的他是谁？

819
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,300
来吧醒醒他是谁？
Come on, wake up. Who is this?

820
01:06:03,540 --> 01:06:07,220
是帝诺常用的疯子
他常常出现在帝诺的电影里
One of the lunatics Dino always uses.
He's in a bunch of these.

821
01:06:07,460 --> 01:06:08,380
他叫什么名字？
What's his name?

822
01:06:08,580 --> 01:06:11,300
不知道这是他的特点
I don't know. That's his whole thing.

823
01:06:11,580 --> 01:06:13,660
他经常戴面具

824

他叫自己“兵器”

825
01:06:15,660 --> 01:06:17,060
不是“机器”

826
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:19,740
他叫自己“机器”

827
01:06:21,340 --> 01:06:23,660
他是个工作狂

828
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:26,900
他绝对热爱他的工作

for a living.

829
01:06:27,900 --> 01:06:29,980
我希望我也可以这样说你
I wish I could say the same about you.

830
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:42,180
是是
Yes, yes.

831
01:06:43,940 --> 01:06:46,780
我可以感觉到他们
非常欣赏我的风格
I can see they
really appreclate my style here.

832
01:06:46,940 --> 01:06:49,700
我可以马上跟群众打成一片
I kind of blend in with the crowd here.

833
01:06:49,860 --> 01:06:50,940
可能你没留意
If you didn't notice.

834
01:06:51,180 --> 01:06:53,500
像这里的女士
她们喜欢我的风格
Like these ladies here,
they like my style.

835
01:06:59,260 --> 01:07:00,100
这是谁？
Who is it?

836
01:07:00,340 --> 01:07:02,260
麦克斯加利福尼亚
Yes, this is Max California.

837
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:05,180
我打过电话来
我是范炽在洛杉矶的朋友
I called earlier.
I'm a friend of Frenchie's from L.A.

838
01:07:05,460 --> 01:07:08,380
我和我的合伙人想见伟域先生
My partner and I
would like to speak to Mr. Velvet.

839
01:07:08,540 --> 01:07:09,860
他不在这里
He's not here.

840
01:07:10,540 --> 01:07:12,700
我们有一笔钱给他
We're here to give him
a large sum of money.

841
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:14,380
如果没兴趣
我们就走了
If he's not interested, we'll split.

842
01:07:33,060 --> 01:07:34,980
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talk about.

843
01:07:35,140 --> 01:07:38,660
你能回答我的简单问题吗？
Can't you just answer
my simple question?

844
01:07:40,220 --> 01:07:43,900
我问你罗拉他妈的在哪里？！
I asked you a question!
Where the fuck is Laura?!

845
01:07:44,300 --> 01:07:47,140
那是我过去十分钟
一直问你的问题
That's what I've been asking you
the last 1 0 minutes.

846
01:07:47,300 --> 01:07:49,820
请坐不要客气
Sit down. Make yourself comfortable.

847
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,420
你这呆子！
You idiot!

848
01:07:51,660 --> 01:07:53,660
两天后拍摄？
Going to shoot in two days?

849
01:07:53,900 --> 01:07:56,180
喂你在乱花我的钱
Man, you're spending my money.

850
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:58,340
嗯你最好这样
Yeah, you better do that.

851
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,660
操你的
Fucking asshole.

852
01:08:00,900 --> 01:08:03,660
很荣幸认识你
谢谢你接见我们
It's an honour to meet you.
Thank you for seeing us.

853
01:08:05,180 --> 01:08:06,340
天啊
God.

854
01:08:09,020 --> 01:08:10,740
那我可以有什么效劳？
So, what can I do you for?

855
01:08:11,020 --> 01:08:15,940
我们想委托你制作一套影片
一套独一无二的帝诺伟域影片
We'd like to commission a film.
A Dino Velvet original, one of a kind.

856
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:17,780
对
That's right.

857
01:08:18,260 --> 01:08:20,500
我很崇拜你
I'm a huge admirer of yours.

858
01:08:20,780 --> 01:08:23,020
天我爱被人捧
God, I love flattery.

859
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:26,620
你是个天才伟域先生
一个不可多得的天才
You're a genius, Mr. Velvet.
A goddamn genius.

860
01:08:26,780 --> 01:08:29,100
唯一仍然用底片拍成录影带
The only one still transferring film
to video.

861
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:32,460
再没有人欣赏这种诚意
Nobody really appreclates
that kind of integrity anymore.

862
01:08:32,700 --> 01:08:35,180
你电影所表现的狂妄气质
The grain and the gritty look you get.

863
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:39,860
那套是你的至爱？
Which is your favourite?

864
01:08:40,380 --> 01:08:41,540
如果我要选
If I had to choose...

865
01:08:41,700 --> 01:08:43,540
那一定是窒息或魔鬼
...it'd be Choke or Devil.

866
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:45,460
那种潜意识意像
The subliminal imagery...

867
01:08:45,620 --> 01:08:48,460
在窒息里真正令你毛骨悚然
...in Choke is what
really gets under your skin.

868
01:08:49,460 --> 01:08:53,620
而魔鬼令我害怕也令我兴奋
Well, Devil frightened me
as much as it excited me...

869
01:08:53,860 --> 01:08:56,540
但很难去选一套最爱
...but I'd be hard-pressed
to choose a favourite.

870
01:09:01,140 --> 01:09:03,980
预算是多少？
What kind of a budget
are we talking about?

871
01:09:05,060 --> 01:09:06,740
预付五千
Five thousand now.

872
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:09,220
完成后再付五千
Five thousand upon delivery.

873
01:09:09,580 --> 01:09:11,820
两个女人一个黑一个白
Two women. One white, one black.

874
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:14,220
性奴当然
Hard bondage, of course.

875
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,500
除了这我信任….
Other than that, trusting your...

876
01:09:16,660 --> 01:09:18,740
你的艺术表达
...artistic interpretation...

877
01:09:18,980 --> 01:09:21,340
我只有两个条件
...I only have two stipulations.

878
01:09:26,260 --> 01:09:27,660
尽管说
Challenge me.

879
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,180
我要看着你们工作
I want to watch you work.

880
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,820
你要不要特许经营权？
You don't want a franchise, do you?

881
01:09:35,340 --> 01:09:38,340
偷取我泡制火辣辣酱料
Steal the recipe for my secret...

882
01:09:38,500 --> 01:09:40,660
的秘方？
...hot sauce?

883
01:09:41,500 --> 01:09:42,740
不要
No.

884
01:09:44,860 --> 01:09:46,020
那很好
That's good.

885
01:09:46,260 --> 01:09:48,260
我谢谢你
I appreclate that.

886
01:09:53,620 --> 01:09:55,100
第二条件
Second stipulation.

887
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:57,020
另外那演员
The other performer...

888
01:09:57,700 --> 01:09:59,540
必须是….
...has to be...

889
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:01,700
你用的那野兽….
...that animal you use.

890
01:10:01,860 --> 01:10:03,460
戴面具的男人
The man in the mask.

891
01:10:04,860 --> 01:10:06,260
机器
Machine.

892
01:10:13,460 --> 01:10:14,860
我不知道
I don't know.

893
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,620
他可能有兴趣
He might be interested.

894
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:22,060
我想我要多收你….
But I think it'll cost you another...

895
01:10:24,540 --> 01:10:26,540
五到七千元
...five to seven grand.

896
01:10:26,980 --> 01:10:29,820
如果你多付一万
我可以安排更特别的东西
I can arrange something
really special for ten.

897
01:10:30,220 --> 01:10:31,620
我可以去安排
We can do that.

898
01:10:31,900 --> 01:10:33,300
那很好
Good enough for me.

899
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:38,980
我要开始构思
I'll just have to put
my thinking cap on.

900
01:10:42,900 --> 01:10:46,220
我会收起这个当订金
I'm going to keep this as a deposit.

901
01:10:46,380 --> 01:10:49,500
记得今晚十点后打电话给我
You make sure you call me
after 1 0 o'clock tonight.

902
01:10:49,660 --> 01:10:51,300
十点
1 0 o'clock.

903
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:57,500
你知道吗你有张很特别
You know, you have a very special...

904
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:59,740
很漂亮的脸
...very beautiful face.

905
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:02,180
尤其当光反射在你脸上时

906

我想拍你
I'd like to shoot you.

907
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,820
你不介意吧？
You don't mind?

908
01:11:08,060 --> 01:11:09,540
我怕见镜头
I'm camera-shy.

909
01:11:09,820 --> 01:11:12,700
你信任我让我拿走你的钱
却不让我拍照
You trust me to take your money,
but not your picture?

910
01:11:12,940 --> 01:11:15,340
那是两种不同的信任
Those are two different kinds of trust.

911
01:11:15,900 --> 01:11:18,020
希望我们可以合作做生意
I hope we can do business.

我还有事谢谢
I got something to tend to. Thanks.

915
01:11:40,620 --> 01:11:42,900
我们是否要拍电影？
So are we in the movie business?

916
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:44,980
这是给你的
That's for you.

917
01:11:45,220 --> 01:11:46,020
是什么？
What is it?

918
01:11:46,220 --> 01:11:48,220
钱人们买东西用的
Money.
People use it to purchase goods.

919
01:11:48,700 --> 01:11:50,860
那很慷慨但….
That's awfully generous
and everything--

920
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,540
不是我的不要当作什么大事
It's not mine.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

921
01:11:53,700 --> 01:11:57,460
有班飞机和这机票
你今晚可以回洛杉矶
There's a plane ticket and the flight
you can catch to L.A. tonight.

922
01:11:57,580 --> 01:11:59,580
我要你做的就是这么多
This is as far as I want you to go.

923
01:11:59,780 --> 01:12:01,460
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

924
01:12:01,660 --> 01:12:03,300
我们是一伙的
我们是合伙人
We're a team. We're partners.

925
01:12:03,540 --> 01:12:08,300
麦克斯我肯定你知道
跟我们周旋的这些人
Max, I'm sure you realize
these people we're dealing with...

926
01:12:09,300 --> 01:12:10,900
他们是极度没人性的
...they're extremely disturbed.

927
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,180
所以你需要我
我了解他们你看我
That's why you need me.
I know disturbed. Look at me.

928
01:12:14,380 --> 01:12:17,340
你做得很好但是时候回家
You did a great job here.
It's time for you to go home.

929
01:12:17,580 --> 01:12:19,220
但这是我们的大案子
But this is our big case.

930
01:12:20,060 --> 01:12:22,660
汤姆我知道发生什么事？
Tom, I know what's going on, okay?

931
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,420
什么事？
Okay, what?

932
01:12:24,660 --> 01:12:27,500
帝诺和机器和爱迪
制作一套色情暴力电影对吗？
Dino and Machine and Eddie
made a snuff film, right?

933
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:29,660
我弄不清为什么你会参与其中
I can't figure out why you're involved.

934
01:12:29,900 --> 01:12:31,340
或者这受害人….？
What, maybe the victim--?

935
01:12:31,580 --> 01:12:32,980
第一谁说你对？
First, who said you're right?

936
01:12:33,180 --> 01:12:35,500
第二谁说有受害人？
Second, who said
anything about a victim?

937
01:12:35,900 --> 01:12:38,020
汤威尔斯生命只有三条规条
Only 3 rules in life, Tom Welles.

938
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:41,500
一永远有受害人
二不要做受害人
One, there's always a victim.
And two, don't be it.

939
01:12:41,740 --> 01:12:42,580
三呢？
And three?

940
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:43,980
忘记三是什么了
I forgot three.

941
01:12:44,180 --> 01:12:46,260
好我希望你忘记一切
Good, I want you to forget everything.

942
01:12:46,500 --> 01:12:49,860
我要你上飞机
回洛杉矶并忘记一切
I want you to get on a plane,
go back to L.A. and forget it all.

943
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,020
我在西岸工作的机会很多
I get a lot of calls for work
on the West Coast.

944
01:12:53,300 --> 01:12:55,780
我会再打电话给你
请你帮忙
I'd like to call you again.
I could use help.

945

你会再跟我联络吧？
You're going to look me up and call me?

946
01:12:58,420 --> 01:13:02,340
我要你帮我我认为你很机伶
I could use your help. I meant it
when I said I think you're smart.

947
01:13:02,620 --> 01:13:04,780
我不是对你施恩
I'm not patronizing you.

948
01:13:04,940 --> 01:13:06,300
那谢谢你
Well, thanks.

949
01:13:06,700 --> 01:13:09,500
好你保重麦克斯
All right.

950
01:13:15,740 --> 01:13:18,700
好的汤威尔斯
魔鬼在等着你
All right, Tom Welles.
Devil's waiting on you.

951
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:43,220

01:15:11,980 --> 01:15:12,980

女人在哪里？
Where are the women?

959
01:15:16,140 --> 01:15:17,580

Women...

960
01:15:18,660 --> 01:15:20,660
她们常常迟到
...they're always late.

961
01:15:27,420 --> 01:15:28,700
这是做什么？
What are these for?

962
01:15:29,420 --> 01:15:31,660
只是道具
They're just props.

963
01:15:31,820 --> 01:15:33,860
很漂亮对不对？
Nice, aren't they?

964
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:38,180
机器和我刚刚在讨论刀的美
Machine and I were just talking
about the beauty of knives.

965
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:44,580
我的客人来了
My guests have arrived!

966
01:15:46,860 --> 01:15:48,660
W先生可不可以请你
Mister W., would you be so kind...

967
01:15:48,860 --> 01:15:51,860
放下身上的枪械？
...as to remove
any firearms from your person?

968
01:15:52,620 --> 01:15:53,580
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

969
01:15:54,780 --> 01:15:57,620
我很讨厌重覆自己
这让我看起来很笨
I hate to repeat myself.
It makes me look so stupid.

970
01:15:58,180 --> 01:15:59,420
慢慢来
Slowly.

971
01:15:59,620 --> 01:16:01,940
请给我看你的枪
Please, show me your gun.

972
01:16:03,100 --> 01:16:04,540
别紧张！
Nice and easy!

973
01:16:05,860 --> 01:16:08,100
对别紧张
That's right. Easy.

974
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:09,940
好
Good.

975
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:13,300
把子弹拿出来放在台上
Now empty those bullets onto the table.

976
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:14,940
很小心地
Very carefully.

977
01:16:15,100 --> 01:16:18,180
-我不知道为何你会以为….
-住口他妈的
-I don't know why you think--
-Shut up, you fuck!

978
01:16:18,700 --> 01:16:22,900
我会一箭
穿过你他妈的喉咙明白吗？
I'll put an arrow right through
your goddamn throat, you understand?

979
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,300
就是他
That's him.

980
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:32,860
最后的子弹
最后一颗
Last bullet. That's last one.

981
01:16:33,540 --> 01:16:34,700
乖孩子
Good boy.

982
01:16:34,900 --> 01:16:37,500
爱迪把他铐在床上
Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.

983
01:16:38,020 --> 01:16:39,380
是的
Yes, sir.

984
01:16:39,620 --> 01:16:40,900
机器
Machine!

985
01:16:47,900 --> 01:16:50,740
刚开始我不知道对你如何评价
I didn't know
what to make of you at first.

986
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:56,980
而你肯定令到爱迪如坐针毯
And you certainly had Eddie here
on pins and needles.

987
01:16:58,580 --> 01:17:01,580
看哪在意料之外….
Lo and behold,
from right out of the blue came...

988
01:17:01,820 --> 01:17:06,180
有我们以前生意的伙伴
来解释一切
..an old business acquaintance of ours
to explain everything.

989
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:09,860
机器之神来解疑难
Satan ex machina.

990
01:17:10,740 --> 01:17:13,420
你记得朗先生吗？
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

991
01:17:16,340 --> 01:17:17,420
让我们解决他
Let's get this over with.

992
01:17:17,660 --> 01:17:19,780
住口没人跟你说话
Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

993
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:25,020
这些脸孔
在影片里可以做什么
What I could do
with faces like these on film.

994
01:17:25,780 --> 01:17:29,500
但我回头想
我为何需要他们的脸孔？
But on second thought,
why would I need their faces?

995
01:17:30,620 --> 01:17:31,940
你要听我说
You're going to listen to me.

996
01:17:32,100 --> 01:17:33,700
你去取那影片
You're going to get that film.

997
01:17:33,940 --> 01:17:36,900
你去将那影片拿回来交给我
You're going to
bring it back here, give it to me.

998
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:41,460
效率越高的话
Just so we make this
as efficient as possible...

999
01:17:41,620 --> 01:17:44,300
我会重重有赏
...there is an incentive.

1000
01:17:55,300 --> 01:17:57,460
这与他无关
He's got nothing to do with this.

1001
01:17:57,620 --> 01:17:59,380
他什么都不知道
He doesn't know anything.

1002
01:17:59,780 --> 01:18:03,460
你想到我接着想说什么？！
Can't you guess
what I'm about to say next?!

1003
01:18:05,140 --> 01:18:07,540
如果你不将那影片拿回来给我
If you don't bring me that film...

1004
01:18:07,700 --> 01:18:10,060
我们会杀死他操他
...we're going to kill him, fuck him...

1005
01:18:10,460 --> 01:18:11,980
并拍摄全程
...and film it.

1006
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,620
如果这还不够
If that's not enough for you...

1007
01:18:17,980 --> 01:18:20,700
我们打算去找你的家人
...we're going to go after your family.

1008
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,060
我去取影片
I'll get the film.

1009
01:18:27,340 --> 01:18:28,660
乖孩子
Good boy.

1010
01:18:28,820 --> 01:18:30,420
你非常合作
You're being very cooperative.

1011
01:18:30,980 --> 01:18:33,820
朗先生会陪着你
Mr. Longdale here
will keep you company.

1012
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:35,900
为什么是我？
Why me?

1013
01:18:36,180 --> 01:18:38,580
因为我不喜欢你朗先生
Because I don't like you, Mr. Longdale.

1014
01:18:48,340 --> 01:18:49,900
W先生
Mr. W...

1015
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:54,780
快回来
...hurry back.

1016
01:18:59,300 --> 01:19:01,700
从我一见你你并没有做过什么
Since I met you,
there isn't much you've done...

1017
01:19:01,940 --> 01:19:03,540
我也没有理会
...that I haven't been party to.

1018
01:19:03,780 --> 01:19:06,780
如果你放弃并退出
就没有事会发生
None of this would be happening
if you'd given up and walked away.

1019
01:19:07,020 --> 01:19:09,620
更理想的是
一开始你就没有接这工作
Or better yet,
not taken the job in the first place.

1020
01:19:09,860 --> 01:19:12,260
我没有想到你会查的这么深入
I never expected you to get this far.

1021
01:19:12,460 --> 01:19:14,460
我聘请你因为你年青
I hired you because you're young...

1022
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:16,540
肯定不会成功
..and completely out of your league.

1023
01:19:16,780 --> 01:19:19,300
但我低估了你的野心
But I underestimated your ambition.

1024
01:19:19,540 --> 01:19:22,260
你看过克里斯家的豪宅
You took one look
at the Christian compound.

1025
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:24,220
很让你羡慕吧？
It was heady, wasn't it?

1026
01:19:24,380 --> 01:19:26,300
这次你不只是在门口张望
You weren't just peeking through
the gates this time.

1027
01:19:26,460 --> 01:19:28,500
不克里斯太太邀请你进入
No, Mrs. Christian welcomed you in.

1028
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:32,180
你会以为克里斯太太聘请我们
Do you think people like
the Christians hire people like us...

1029
01:19:32,380 --> 01:19:34,620
便会邀请我们去晚宴？
...as an invitation
to their dinner parties?

1030
01:19:34,900 --> 01:19:36,540
我们要为他们收拾烂摊子
No, we're there to clean up the mess...

1031
01:19:36,700 --> 01:19:39,220
替他们收拾残局
...to wipe their royal asses.

1032
01:19:39,460 --> 01:19:41,140
叫你去买套色情暴力电影
You were asked to buy a snuff film.

1033
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:44,540
他们找不到
你就付钱去制作一套？
They couldn't find one,
so you paid them to make you one?

1034
01:19:44,700 --> 01:19:46,460
情况是不是这样？
Isn't that what happened?

1035
01:19:46,980 --> 01:19:49,660
她本来是活生生的
你付钱让他们把她杀掉？
She was alive
till you paid to have her murdered?

1036
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:51,740
克里斯先生付了多少钱
给你的良知？
How much did Christian
pay for your conscience?

1037
01:19:51,940 --> 01:19:52,740
一百万？
A million?

1038
01:19:53,540 --> 01:19:55,140
我已经得到补偿
I've been well compensated.

1039
01:19:55,420 --> 01:19:57,220
但你我廉价请你
But you, I bought cheap.

1040
01:19:58,820 --> 01:20:02,380
因为克里斯太太赞赏你的谨慎
Just because Mrs. Christian
praised your discretion...

1041
01:20:02,580 --> 01:20:04,060
便把这谋杀案的证物给你
...you sat on evidence of murder.

1042
01:20:04,260 --> 01:20:05,820
你将你的朋友家人
Dragged your friend, family...

1043
01:20:06,020 --> 01:20:08,620
拖进坟墓里
...into some old graveyard...

1044
01:20:08,820 --> 01:20:12,780
将一个没人理会或记得的
死掉少女发掘出来
...to dig up a dead girl with no name
that nobody cares about or remembers.

1045
01:20:13,020 --> 01:20:14,340
玛丽·安马修
Mary Anne Mathews.

1046
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:15,940
那是她的名字
That was her name.

1047
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,540
她母亲记得她
Her mother remembers her.

1048
01:20:17,740 --> 01:20:19,180
我觉得厌烦
I'm bored with this.

1049
01:20:19,540 --> 01:20:21,700
你知道我们之间的不同处？
You know the only difference
between us?

1050
01:20:21,940 --> 01:20:25,180
我会因这事继续生存
并从中获利而你….
I will survive this and profit by it,
whereas you...

1051
01:20:25,420 --> 01:20:26,500
你却不会
...you will not.

1052
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,380
现在去取影片
Now get the film.

1053
01:20:33,940 --> 01:20:35,700
你有和他一起看？
Did you watch it with him?

1054
01:20:35,860 --> 01:20:36,780
什么？
What?

1055
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,180
那影片你有和他一起看吗？
The snuff film.
Did you watch it with him?

1056
01:20:39,420 --> 01:20:41,700
这帮不到你的朋友去取影片
This isn't helping your friend.
Get the film.

1057
01:20:41,940 --> 01:20:42,940
他有感到兴奋？
Did it get him off?

1058
01:20:43,460 --> 01:20:44,860
克里斯先生？
Mr. Christian?

1059
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:48,380
看着他们把她切开
他有手淫吗？
Watching them cut her up like that?
Did he jerk off to it?

1060
01:20:48,620 --> 01:20:50,820
你有握他的阴茎替他手淫？
Did you hold his cock?
Give him the hand job...

1061
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:53,940
当看着玛丽·安马修死亡？
..while Mary Anne Mathews was dying?

1062
01:20:54,140 --> 01:20:56,860
-你想做什么？
-我尝试去明白
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to understand!

1063
01:20:57,100 --> 01:20:59,300
他要一套色情暴力电影做什么？！
What did he want with a snuff film?!

1064
01:20:59,700 --> 01:21:00,620
你在问为什么？
You're asking why?

1065
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,820
对为什么？为什么？！
Yes, why? Why?!

1066
01:21:03,060 --> 01:21:04,980
他为什么要一套….
Why did he want a film...

1067
01:21:05,220 --> 01:21:07,700
少女被剖开的影片？！
...of a little girl being butchered?!

1068
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,460
因为他有能力
Because he could.

1069
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:12,980
他这样做因为他有能力
He did it because he could.

1070
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:16,420
你在找什么其他原因？
What other reason
were you looking for?

1071
01:21:21,220 --> 01:21:22,620
快
Now.

1072
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,060
这里
Here.

1073
01:21:38,820 --> 01:21:40,340
射我
Shoot me.

1074
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:51,660
威尔斯先生影片请
Mr. Welles, the film, please.

1075
01:21:52,740 --> 01:21:54,100
先让他走
Let him go first.

1076
01:21:54,260 --> 01:21:56,780
随你喜欢怎样处置我
总之让他走
Do whatever you want to me,
but let him go.

1077
01:21:57,020 --> 01:21:59,260
好的放开他机器
Very well. Set him free, Machine.

1078
01:22:35,980 --> 01:22:37,980
-是这个吗？
-是这个
-Is that it?
-That's it.

1079
01:22:38,280 --> 01:22:39,400
太好了
Bravo.

1080
01:22:40,920 --> 01:22:42,800
我不觉得你会想错过这一段
I don't think you want to miss this...

1081
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:44,640
威尔斯先生
...Mr. Welles.

1082
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:55,960
事件完结
So it ends.

1083
01:22:57,880 --> 01:23:00,480
就像她从来没有存在过
As if she never existed.

1084
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:04,560
不要埋怨自己
你不能控制大局
Don't blame yourself.
You were in way over your head.

1085
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,040
你这卑鄙小人
You motherfuckers.

1086
01:23:09,240 --> 01:23:11,760
你这下流的混帐东西
You smalltime motherfuckers.

1087
01:23:13,480 --> 01:23:15,360
我想知道
I want to know something:

1088
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:19,840
你们有一百万去分为什么
还是下流的贱货？！
Why you're still smalltime with a
million dollars to spread around?!

1089
01:23:20,320 --> 01:23:21,320
一百万？
Million?

1090
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,400
对那是克里斯家给朗的！
Yeah! That's what Christian
gave Longdale!

1091
01:23:25,160 --> 01:23:27,000
那是他给你的对不对？
That's what he gave you, right?

1092
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:28,480
一百万现金？
A million in cash?

1093
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:31,160
你这白痴他妈的垃圾！
You stupid fucking trash!

1094
01:23:31,320 --> 01:23:35,320
去死的他是不是说美金？
What the hell--
Is he talking dollars here?

1095
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:37,160
不他在说谎
No, he's lying.

1096
01:23:37,360 --> 01:23:38,680
你骗我吗？
Did you fuck me?

1097
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:41,360
你有没有骗我？
Did you fuck me on this?

1098
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:42,680
当然没有爱迪！
Of course not, Edward!

1099
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,920
那他在说什么？
Then what's he talking about?

1100
01:23:45,120 --> 01:23:46,360
他在说….
He's saying that...

1101
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:48,120
朗骗我们
...Longdale fucked us...

1102
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,280
这是绝对离谱的事
...which is so totally,
completely bizarre.

1103
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:52,880
退后
Stay back.

1104
01:23:53,480 --> 01:23:54,600
离我远点
Stay away from me.

1105
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:56,760
放下那把弓！
Put the bow down!

1106
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,840
我告诉过你不要相信那龟蛋
I told you not to trust the prick.

1107
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:01,800
朗先生如果变态佬
和色情行业之间
Mr. Longdale, if there's no honour...

1108
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,880
没有道义存在的话
...among perverts and pornographers...

1109
01:24:04,040 --> 01:24:06,200
整个行业将会崩溃
..the whole business would fall apart.

1110
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:10,080
因为我们没有记录没有合约
没有法律保障
Because there's no records,
no contracts, no legal recourse.

1111
01:24:10,360 --> 01:24:11,960
所以如果有人
So if someone...

1112
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:13,360
欺骗我们
...cheats us...

1113
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:15,280
那人不再被信任
...that person can't be trusted.

1114
01:24:15,440 --> 01:24:18,120
那人会把我们害死
That person could turn us in,
have us killed.

1115
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:23,160
所以我们无选择余地
对吗朗先生
So we don't have a choice,
do we, Mr. Longdale?

1116
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:26,400
我要这事完结
没有其他人要被伤害
I want this to be over.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

1117
01:24:26,640 --> 01:24:28,240
爱迪把你的枪拿出来
Eddie, take your gun out.

1118
01:24:28,640 --> 01:24:29,640
操你
Fuck you.

1119
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:32,040
拿出来放地上
Take it out now! And drop it.

1120
01:24:32,240 --> 01:24:33,880
不然我会开枪
Or I will shoot.

1121
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,200
别那么傻爱迪
Don't be stupid, Edward.

1122
01:24:41,560 --> 01:24:43,160
用力踢过来
Kick it in my direction. Hard.

1123
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,400
帝诺快放下那把弓
Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.

1124
01:24:53,920 --> 01:24:55,400
开始
Action.

1125
01:25:07,000 --> 01:25:08,840
错了
This is wrong.

1126
01:25:09,040 --> 01:25:10,840
搞错了
Something's wrong.

1127
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:13,080
天啊不应是这样
God, not like this.

1128
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:17,320
我应该有
I am supposed to have...

1129
01:25:18,080 --> 01:25:19,960
更多的电影感
...something more cinematic.

1130
01:25:20,600 --> 01:25:22,280
机器杀死他们
Kill them, Machine.

1131
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:25,240
把他们全杀掉
Kill them all.

1132
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,000
机器！
Machine!

1133
01:26:15,320 --> 01:26:16,160
不要动爱迪
Stop, Eddie!

1134
01:26:17,760 --> 01:26:18,840
我发誓
I swear to Christ!

1135
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:20,480
我会向你背后开枪
I'll shoot you in the back!

1136
01:26:22,320 --> 01:26:23,520
除掉面具
Take off the mask.

1137
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:27,240
除掉那他妈的面具！
Take off the fucking mask!

1138
01:26:27,480 --> 01:26:29,480
他只有一颗子弹
He's only got one bullet!

1139
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:13,280
艾美小心听着
Amy, listen carefully.

1140
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:15,760
-汤姆你在哪里？
-艾美听着
-Tom, where are you?
-Amy, just listen.

1141
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:18,280
现在带仙蒂离开家
Take Cindy. Get out of the house now.

1142
01:28:18,520 --> 01:28:20,880
去我们渡国庆日周末的地方
Go to where we spent
Fourth of July weekend.

1143
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,960
-为什么？出了什么岔？
-艾美我不能解释
-Why? What's wrong?
-Amy, please. l can't.

1144
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:26,200
我三小时后会到
I'll be there in three hours.

1145
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,440
我在途中快动身
I'm on my way! Go now!

1146
01:28:28,840 --> 01:28:30,760
汤姆你吓死我
Tom, you're scaring me.

1147
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,800
艾美请你照我所说的去做
Please, Amy, just do it!

1148
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:35,800
好再见我现在去
Okay, bye. I'm going.

1149
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:45,440
克里斯太太这是汤威尔斯

1150
01:28:45,640 --> 01:28:46,960
朗已死
Longdale is dead.

1151
01:28:47,200 --> 01:28:49,280
他被制作那套影片的人所杀
He was killed by the men
who made the film.

1152
01:28:49,520 --> 01:28:52,680
他为你丈夫雇用他们
但藏了一百万的大部份
He hired them for your husband.
Kept most of the million.

1153
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:54,640
那影片是真的
The film is real!

1154
01:28:54,880 --> 01:28:56,120
他们杀死那少女
They killed that girl!

1155
01:28:58,120 --> 01:28:59,560

1156
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:02,560
我仍在威尔斯先生
I'm still here, Mr. Welles.

1157
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:04,200
对不起我知道这一定….
I'm sorry. I know this must be--

1158
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:05,960
你有危险吗？
Are you in danger？.

1159
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,880
我们要报警
我今晚将整件事告诉你

We can call the police in the morning.

1161

Eight o'clock?

1163
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:15,800
八点整没有问题
Yes, eight o'clock is fine.

1164
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:17,160
你知不知道….
Do you know...

1165
01:29:17,400 --> 01:29:21,400
那个可怜少女的名字
..what the poor girl's name was?

1166
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,680
玛丽·安马修
Mary Anne Mathews.

1167
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:30,400
谢谢你
Thank you.

1168
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,840
再见威尔斯先生
Mr. Welles, goodbye.

1169

你没事吗？
Are you okay?

1170
01:30:34,400 --> 01:30:35,640
你没事吗？
Are you?

1171
01:30:36,560 --> 01:30:38,960
你为什么没有打电话给我？
Why haven't you called me?

1172
01:30:41,640 --> 01:30:44,880
你为什么在地球的表层失了踪
Why did you disappear
off the face of the Earth?

1173
01:30:46,080 --> 01:30:47,720
你在流血
You're bleeding.

1174
01:30:48,240 --> 01:30:49,920
这是手铐吗？
Are those handcuffs?

1175
01:30:50,080 --> 01:30:51,920
你被人锁起吗？
Were you locked up?

1176
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:55,640
不准你打电话？发生什么事？
Kept from a phone? What happened?

1177
01:30:55,920 --> 01:30:56,920
汤姆说话呀
Start talking, Tom.

1178
01:30:57,160 --> 01:31:01,080
如果你不想离婚的话
你不能这样对我
Because if you want to stay married,
you can't treat me this way!

1179
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:03,080
说得对
You're right.

1180
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:05,240
你说的全部对
Everything you say is right.

1181
01:31:07,680 --> 01:31:10,160
汤姆这样不够
这样不能解决问题
That won't do it.
That's not enough, Tom.

1182
01:31:10,320 --> 01:31:11,520
不会
Not anymore.

1183
01:31:12,680 --> 01:31:15,280
我不会让任何事发生在我们身上
I'm not going to let
anything happen to us.

1184
01:31:15,520 --> 01:31:17,600

Look where we are!

1185
01:31:18,160 --> 01:31:20,920
看看你自己你看看你自己
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself! Look!

1186
01:31:21,760 --> 01:31:23,280
你这狗娘养的
You son of a bitch.

1187
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,280
你根本不知道
你是让我怎么过的
You don't even have any idea
what you're putting me through.

1188
01:31:29,200 --> 01:31:32,520
我无法想像你发生什么事
What was I supposed to think
happened to you?

1189
01:31:38,280 --> 01:31:40,280
我们要在这里住几天
We're going to stay here a few days.

1190
01:31:40,520 --> 01:31:41,960
只是几天
It's just a few days.

1191

我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

1192
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:44,960
没有其他方法
There's no other way around this.

1193
01:31:45,120 --> 01:31:47,440
好了我发誓我发誓
Okay, look. I swear, I swear...

1194
01:31:49,720 --> 01:31:52,800
我不会让任何事发生在我们身上
我会处理
...I won't let anything happen to us.
I'll take care of it.

1195
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:54,640
我发誓
I swear it.

1196
01:31:55,640 --> 01:31:57,120
我发誓
I swear it.

1197
01:31:59,120 --> 01:32:01,200
我现在要出去
Now I have to go back out.

1198
01:32:01,960 --> 01:32:03,240

我要去见克里斯太太

她是唯一的证人
She's the only witness.

1201
01:32:12,720 --> 01:32:14,000
什么证人？
To what?

1202
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:18,240
我们会没事的
We're going to be okay.

1203
01:32:21,240 --> 01:32:23,080
我们会没事的
We're going to be okay.

1204
01:32:37,240 --> 01:32:39,520
我是汤威尔斯我约了克里斯太太
Tom Welles.
Mrs. Christian's expecting me.

1205
01:32:39,680 --> 01:32:41,680
是她留下了指示

1210
01:33:00,040 --> 01:33:01,440
我刚刚才跟她通过电话

1211
01:33:01,680 --> 01:33:04,880
她留下了指示:第一个信封

是给玛丽·安的家人
...is for Mary's family.

1213
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:10,040
她写着你会明白什么意思
She wrote that you'd understand
what that meant.

1214
01:33:10,960 --> 01:33:13,200
第二个信封是给你的
And the second envelope is for you.

Services will be held next week,
if you'd like to attend.

1216
01:33:20,880 --> 01:33:22,560
对不起先生
I am sorry, sir.

1217

晚安先生
Good night, sir.

1218
01:33:44,160 --> 01:33:47,400
请忘记我们

1219
01:34:00,160 --> 01:34:01,600
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

1220
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:06,080
我要回去
I have to go back.

1221
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,160
不管什么事
Whatever it is...

1222
01:34:19,520 --> 01:34:21,440
不管你曾经去过哪里
...wherever you were...

1223
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:23,760
把一切忘记
...just forget about it.

1224
01:34:24,000 --> 01:34:25,680
你留在此
You stay here.

1225
01:34:26,200 --> 01:34:27,760
我不能
I can't.

1226
01:34:30,760 --> 01:34:33,960
冒着我们的生命危险
冒着家人的危险？为什么？
And risk us? Risk your family? Why?

1227
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:37,880
除了我没有人收拾残局
There's no one left
to finish this but me.

1228
01:34:38,960 --> 01:34:41,120
我会跟你说
什么时候可以安全回家
I'll call you when it's safe to go home.

1229
01:34:43,880 --> 01:34:46,440
当你回家时我们未必会在
We may not be there
when you get back.

Put your hands on your head.
Down on your knees.

1233
01:36:11,600 --> 01:36:13,600
你以为我是闹着玩？
You think I'm fucking around?

1234
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:17,880
痛了吧？
Hurts, doesn't it?

1235
01:36:18,040 --> 01:36:19,440
你想他妈的怎样？
What the fuck do you want?

1236
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:20,800
机器是谁？
Who's Machine?

1237
01:36:20,960 --> 01:36:22,200
他住在哪里？
Where does he live?

1238
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:24,120
我不知道
I don't know.

1239
01:36:24,280 --> 01:36:25,800
我要他的名字
I want his name.

1240
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,360
我不知道他的名字
I don't know his name.

1241
01:36:31,480 --> 01:36:33,640
伤害你我永远不会觉得累
I will never get tired of hurting you.

1242
01:36:33,880 --> 01:36:37,880
我不知道他的名字
他总是带着面具来带着面具走
I don't know his name. He shows up
in his mask, he leaves in his mask.

1243
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:40,040
他住在纽约某区
He's from New York somewhere.

1244
01:36:45,480 --> 01:36:46,800
上车
Get in the car.

1245
01:36:48,880 --> 01:36:49,720
为什么？
Why?

1246
01:36:50,320 --> 01:36:52,560
我要你带我去你杀她的现场
You're going to show me
where you killed her.

1247
01:36:53,560 --> 01:36:54,720
操你
Fuck you.

1248
01:36:57,000 --> 01:36:58,920
好的他妈的
All right, you fuck.

1249
01:37:12,920 --> 01:37:15,160
你带她来之前对她做过什么？
What did you do before
you brought her here?

1250
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,920
说她如何漂亮….
Tell her how beautiful she was...

1251
01:37:20,080 --> 01:37:22,280
你将会捧她成巨星
...how you'd make her a big star?

1252
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:29,200
向她献殷勤？
Talk her up?

1253
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,440
你想在我身上得到他妈的什么
What the fuck do you want from me?

1254
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,120
我想知道
I want to know.

1255
01:37:44,600 --> 01:37:46,040
你想知道？
You want to know?

1256
01:37:50,040 --> 01:37:51,440
她不值一提
She was nothing.

1257
01:37:51,800 --> 01:37:53,280
流连在街上的小妓女
A little piece of pussy off the street.

1258
01:37:53,440 --> 01:37:55,960
像这样的少女失了踪
没人会理会
Girl like that disappears,
nobody gives a shit.

1259
01:37:57,560 --> 01:37:59,880
对我向她献殷勤
Yeah, I talked her up.

1260
01:38:00,120 --> 01:38:03,480
对她说她想听的话
对她说她会成为巨星
Told her everything she wanted to hear.
I told her she'd be a big star...

1261
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:06,960
她会赚很多钱还有很多废话
...she'd make a lot of money,
and all the rest of the bullshit.

1262
01:38:07,120 --> 01:38:11,160
当我说完她已为那大荧幕试镜
感到异常兴奋
By the time I was finished, she was
all excited about her big screen test.

1263
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:14,880
我打电话给帝诺
I called up Dino...

1264
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:18,080
他和机器飞过来
我们开了一个小型派对
...he and Machine flew out here.
We had a little party.

1265
01:38:20,000 --> 01:38:21,480
你还想知道什么？
What else you want to know?

1266
01:38:22,640 --> 01:38:24,240
你看过那影片？
You saw the film, right?

1267
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:26,560
你知道结局
You know the ending.

1268
01:38:28,760 --> 01:38:31,000
没有人看见你带她来这里？
Nobody else saw you bring her in?

1269
01:38:33,560 --> 01:38:36,400
谁会看见？这样的烂地方
Who's going to see?
Place is a fucking shithole.

1270
01:38:40,000 --> 01:38:41,840
我带她进来然后….
I brought her in and she...

1271
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:46,160
她看见机器站在角落处
...saw Machine
standing in the corner.

1272
01:38:47,680 --> 01:38:49,280
她开始哭
She started crying...

1273
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:53,360
发出些声音
...making these little noises.

1274
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:58,200
我打了她要她安静
So I slapped her around a bit
just to shut her up.

1275
01:38:58,840 --> 01:39:00,000
帝诺….
Dino...

1276
01:39:00,200 --> 01:39:02,200
喂她吃了一些“药丸”
...fed her a bunch of pills.

1277
01:39:03,840 --> 01:39:06,360
机器在这里铺了几块胶布
Machine put down the plastic over here.

1278
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,520
开始把她割开
Just started cutting her up.

1279
01:39:15,520 --> 01:39:17,360
就这样她死了
That's it. She's dead.

1280
01:39:18,120 --> 01:39:21,200
她死了那么久
除了你没有人会理会
She's been dead a long time.
Nobody gives a shit but you.

1281
01:39:35,880 --> 01:39:37,640
你想知道
You wanted to know.

1282
01:39:38,040 --> 01:39:39,640
现在你知道了
Now you know.

1283
01:39:41,640 --> 01:39:43,240
你当时在这里
You were in here.

1284
01:39:43,400 --> 01:39:46,960
你从这里看着玛丽·安流血至死
You watched Mary Anne
bleed to death from here.

1285
01:39:48,560 --> 01:39:49,560
为什么？
Why?

1286
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:53,080
你为什么看？
Why did you watch?

1287
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,480
我喜欢
I felt like it.

1288
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,400
我从来没有看过人被杀
I never saw nobody get done before.

1289
01:40:00,480 --> 01:40:01,480
为什么？
Why?

1290
01:40:02,760 --> 01:40:05,080
你有兴奋你有射精吗？
Did you get hard? Did you come?

1291
01:40:05,240 --> 01:40:07,760
没有我感到作呕
No. It made me sick.

1292
01:40:08,000 --> 01:40:09,680
但这与我何干
But what do I give a shit...

1293
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:14,080
假如一些富有疯子要对着这自渎
...if some rich fucking wacko wants
to beat off to something like that?

1294
01:40:14,240 --> 01:40:15,600
别起来！
Stay down!

1295
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:19,920
我是为钱而做
It was something I did for money.

1296
01:40:22,600 --> 01:40:24,600
我需要那些他妈的钱
I needed the fucking money.

1297
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:26,840
她在哪里？
Where is she?

1298
01:40:27,000 --> 01:40:28,600
你把她埋在哪里？
Where did you put her body?

1299
01:40:28,920 --> 01:40:30,760
我把它埋在丛林里
I buried it in the woods.

1300
01:40:32,120 --> 01:40:33,120
你不会找到
You're not going to find it.

1301
01:40:33,360 --> 01:40:35,520
就算你找到又如何？
你会得到什么？
If you find it, so what?
What do you got?

1302
01:40:35,760 --> 01:40:38,040
你只会得到一副骨骸
You got a girl's skeleton, that's it.

1303
01:40:38,200 --> 01:40:40,280
没有了影片你什么都没有
Without the film, you got nothing.

1304
01:40:41,200 --> 01:40:43,200
你可以做的是放我走
So all you can do is cut me loose.

1305
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,800
因为没有了影片你什么都没有
Because without the film
you got nothing--

1306
01:40:46,040 --> 01:40:47,600
你他妈的在做什么？
What the fuck are you doing?!

1307
01:40:47,800 --> 01:40:49,800
-将手放在背后
-操你
-Put your hands behind your back.
-Fuck you!

1308
01:40:50,640 --> 01:40:53,040
将手放在背后
Put your hands behind your back!

1309
01:40:53,280 --> 01:40:54,800
好的
All right.

1310
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:02,040
你他妈的在做什么？
What the fuck are you doing?

1311
01:41:07,960 --> 01:41:09,800
我准备杀了你
I'm going to kill you.

1312
01:41:11,320 --> 01:41:13,160
我准备杀了你
I'm going to kill you.

1313
01:41:14,880 --> 01:41:18,240
然后把你丢在这里
就像你对她一样
And I'm going to leave you here
just like you left her.

1314
01:41:20,240 --> 01:41:22,000
你不会杀我
You're not going to kill me.

1315
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,000
你没有那种勇气
You don't have it in you.

1316
01:41:25,320 --> 01:41:28,160
你打算怎么做？用你的枪射我？
What are you going to do?
Shoot me with your own gun?

1317
01:41:28,320 --> 01:41:29,760
用你名字登记的枪
Registered in your name?

1318
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,760
你小心地计划这行动是吗？
You really thought this through,
didn't you, genius?

1319
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:37,320
你要将子弹从我的头挖出来
You'll have to dig
the bullets out of my head.

1320
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,240
那会很有趣
That'll be nice.

1321
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:43,080
或你可以掘一个洞
Or you could dig a hole.

1322
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:45,240
用你的双手去掘
Dig it with your own hands...

1323
01:41:45,440 --> 01:41:47,440
然后将我埋在你的女朋友旁边
...and bury me next to your girlfriend.

1324
01:41:48,000 --> 01:41:49,240
动手吧
Go ahead.

1325
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,000
开他妈的枪吧
Pull the fucking trigger.

1326
01:41:51,520 --> 01:41:52,440
动手吧
Go ahead.

1327
01:41:52,680 --> 01:41:54,840
你还在等什么？动手开枪吧
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, do it.

1328
01:41:55,000 --> 01:41:56,520
你这同性恋
You faggot!

1329
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,680
你要我做什么？哭？
What do you want me to do?
Start crying?

1330
01:42:00,920 --> 01:42:03,360
像婴儿般哭？
“我后悔杀了那少女”
Like a baby?
''I'm so sorry I killed the girl.''

1331
01:42:03,520 --> 01:42:05,440
操你！操她！
Fuck you! And fuck her!

1332
01:42:05,680 --> 01:42:09,440
动手吧带我脱离痛苦
开他妈的枪吧
Go ahead, put me out of my misery.
Pull the fucking trigger.

1333
01:42:10,600 --> 01:42:12,200
开他妈的枪吧
Pull the fucking trigger.

1334
01:42:12,680 --> 01:42:13,680
开吧
Do it!

1335
01:42:14,680 --> 01:42:15,600
开吧
Do it!

1336
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:24,720
你不敢开
You can't do it.

1337
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:27,720
你这娘娘腔
You little pansy bitch!

1338
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,120
你看你….
Look at you...

1339
01:42:29,280 --> 01:42:31,200
操你的大英雄
...big fucking hero, man.

1340
01:42:31,480 --> 01:42:33,040
你不敢开枪
You can't fucking do it.

1341
01:42:34,960 --> 01:42:36,200
看看他
Look at him.

1342
01:42:37,120 --> 01:42:38,720
他妈的大英雄
Big fucking hero.

1343
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:41,800
快回到你太太那
Go on home to your wifey!

1344
01:42:43,040 --> 01:42:44,720
你这胆小鬼
You pussy!

1345
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,400
你这他妈的胆小鬼
You big fucking pussy!

1346
01:42:49,240 --> 01:42:51,560
你现在可以做什么娘娘腔？
What are you going to do now, faggot?

1347
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:56,240
你不能去报警
You can't go to the cops!

1348
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:02,080
送你太太和女儿来
让我们制作一部影片你这娘娘腔
Send me your wife and daughter.
We'll make a film, you faggot!

1349
01:43:05,400 --> 01:43:06,680
操你
Shit.

1350
01:43:07,160 --> 01:43:08,760
你这无胆匪类
You punk-ass!

1351
01:43:55,800 --> 01:43:57,440
马修太太
Mrs. Mathews?

1352
01:43:57,880 --> 01:43:59,640
我是汤姆
It's Thomas.

1353
01:43:59,960 --> 01:44:01,720
汤贺特
Thomas Hart.

1354
01:44:01,960 --> 01:44:05,280
我几个星期前来问你女儿的事
I was there a few weeks ago
asking about your daughter.

1355
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:08,320
嗯你找到她的日记
Yeah, you found her diary.

1356
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,800
谢谢你
Thank you.

1357
01:44:10,640 --> 01:44:12,640
她有留字条
She did leave a note...

1358
01:44:12,960 --> 01:44:17,320
她的蠢男友在加州丢下她
...and her stupid boyfriend
dumped her in California...

1359
01:44:17,800 --> 01:44:19,240
我已经告诉了调查局
...so I told the FBI.

1360
01:44:20,160 --> 01:44:21,720
你是否记得….
Remember when...

1361
01:44:22,640 --> 01:44:25,320
我问过你想不想知道
...I asked you if you'd want to know...

1362
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:27,840
事情的真相
...the truth...

1363
01:44:28,640 --> 01:44:30,320
无论是什么？
...no matter what?

1364
01:44:31,320 --> 01:44:35,160
几个男人捉了她
杀了她埋葬了她
Some men, they took her and
they killed her and they buried her.

1365
01:44:35,480 --> 01:44:36,320
不不
No, no.

1366
01:44:36,480 --> 01:44:38,000
我很难过
I'm sorry.

1367
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:39,160
我很难过
I'm sorry.

1368
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:42,000
我要惩罚他们所做过的一切
I want to punish them for what they did.

1369
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:44,400
你为什么告诉我这些？
Why are you saying this?

1370
01:44:44,680 --> 01:44:46,320
我可以伤害他们

是看着他们面上的表情
The look on their face.

1413

那个表情….
It's that look...

1414
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:53,000
不是当他们被吓唬
..not when they're threatened...

1415
01:53:53,160 --> 01:53:54,840
不是当你伤害他们

1416
01:53:55,160 --> 01:53:57,680
更不是当他们看见刀

而是当他们感觉刀锋插入

1418
01:54:00,520 --> 01:54:01,760

1422

那少女….
The girl...

1423
01:54:09,520 --> 01:54:11,200
当她发觉那不光是小电影

很难让你明白？

1430
01:55:01,560 --> 01:55:03,240
我没有答案

1431

But nothing will ever
fill the hole in my heart.

1455
01:59:34,400 --> 01:59:36,640
我恨你将事实告诉我
I hated you
for telling me the truth...

1456
01:59:36,800 --> 01:59:40,400
但我感觉到你和我可能是

are probably the only people...

cared about Mary Anne.
