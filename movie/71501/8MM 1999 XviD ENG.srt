1
00:01:23,114 --> 00:01:24,282
Welcome to Miami.

2
00:01:24,616 --> 00:01:27,827
While in the airport, please
observe Florida laws...

3
00:01:27,994 --> 00:01:30,329
... which prohibit smoking
in the terminal.

4
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:32,748
Thank you for not smoking.

5
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:50,820
Your son-in-law dealt with the
dry cleaning franchise during the day.

6
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:53,155
He saw that woman every night.

7
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:58,994
The specifics are in my report,
and information about the woman.

8
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:02,497
It's unpleasant, I know.

9
00:03:03,373 --> 00:03:04,874
Discreet, isn't he?

10
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,126
What an imbecile!

11
00:03:07,335 --> 00:03:10,379
I tried to warn my daughter,
but what can you do?

12
00:03:10,629 --> 00:03:13,257
I worry about the children.

13
00:03:13,507 --> 00:03:15,717
My invoice is in the envelope,
if that's alI.

14
00:03:16,301 --> 00:03:18,303
Yes, Mr. Welles. Thank you.

15
00:03:18,887 --> 00:03:22,223
Senator, Iet me know if I can be
of further assistance to you.

16
00:03:22,432 --> 00:03:24,058
I'Il be in touch.

17
00:04:00,008 --> 00:04:01,343
Hello?

18
00:04:01,885 --> 00:04:03,261
You're home.

19
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:05,680
We're back here.

20
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:07,640
How did it go?

21
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,933
I think very welI.

22
00:04:09,141 --> 00:04:10,226
Good.

23
00:04:10,643 --> 00:04:12,394
Daddy's home, sweetie.

24
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:15,647
How's the textbook business?

25
00:04:16,523 --> 00:04:19,818
I got 10,000 words on
the Federal Theatre project.

26
00:04:20,068 --> 00:04:23,279
It should be 4000 and the writer
doesn't want to change anything.

27
00:04:23,446 --> 00:04:24,822
So, kind of bad.

28
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,700
How was Miami?

29
00:04:27,909 --> 00:04:29,201
Fine. Lonesome.

30
00:04:29,493 --> 00:04:31,412
Couldn't pay me enough
to Iive down there.

31
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,247
Then why'd you go?

32
00:04:33,622 --> 00:04:36,667
Senator Michaelson
has powerful friends.

33
00:04:42,088 --> 00:04:44,090
Hello, Cinderella.

34
00:04:44,799 --> 00:04:46,801
Did you miss me?
I sure missed you.

35
00:04:47,051 --> 00:04:48,594
Oh, that's my girI.

36
00:04:48,803 --> 00:04:51,055
She missed you.
I missed you.

37
00:04:52,473 --> 00:04:53,724
You been smoking?

38
00:04:55,142 --> 00:04:56,810
Smoking? I'm not smoking.

39
00:04:57,936 --> 00:04:59,771
Come on, honey.

40
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:01,815
You reek of it.

41
00:05:02,607 --> 00:05:05,318
Amy, I've been sitting around
in bars following this guy.

42
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:07,278
Is this the first thing I get?

43
00:05:07,528 --> 00:05:10,114
-You're accusing me?
-I'm not accusing you.

44
00:05:11,073 --> 00:05:13,909
I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been all through that.

45
00:05:14,952 --> 00:05:16,995
I'Il make dinner.
Are you hungry?

46
00:05:17,287 --> 00:05:18,163
You're cooking?

47
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,460
I missed you.

48
00:05:29,674 --> 00:05:31,884
I don't Iike it when you Ieave.

49
00:05:36,471 --> 00:05:37,889
Should I go?

50
00:05:38,432 --> 00:05:39,891
I'm going to do it.

51
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,278
Come on.

52
00:05:52,486 --> 00:05:55,239
What's all the trouble, Cinderella?

53
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,449
There, there.

54
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:07,875
I Iove you.

55
00:06:10,711 --> 00:06:12,004
I Iove you.

56
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:27,101
Honey, phone!

57
00:06:35,526 --> 00:06:37,110
Okay, I've got it!

58
00:06:37,277 --> 00:06:39,905
Sorry, I was just switching phones.

59
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:45,868
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Longdale.

60
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,204
How can I be of assistance to you?

61
00:06:53,417 --> 00:06:55,210
Four o'clock would be fine.

62
00:06:59,339 --> 00:07:01,091
I think I know where it is.

63
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,921
Daniel Longdale.
We spoke on the phone.

64
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:43,963
Pleasure.

65
00:07:44,214 --> 00:07:47,175
I'm the Christians' attorney and
an executor of the estate.

66
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,426
This is Mrs. Christian.

67
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,302
An honour to meet you.

68
00:07:50,594 --> 00:07:52,888
You come highly
recommended, Mr. Welles.

69
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:56,975
I've spoken to associates of mine in
Harrisburg, Lancaster and Hershey.

70
00:07:57,142 --> 00:07:58,727
You have influential friends.

71
00:07:58,894 --> 00:08:01,771
I've been privileged to provide
services for people I admire.

72
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,315
You were praised
for your discretion...

73
00:08:04,482 --> 00:08:07,777
...your strict adherence
to confidentiality.

74
00:08:07,944 --> 00:08:08,861
Thank you.

75
00:08:11,864 --> 00:08:14,783
As you know,
my husband passed away recently.

76
00:08:15,075 --> 00:08:17,202
My condolences, Mrs. Christian.

77
00:08:17,411 --> 00:08:22,290
His passing has Ieft me
with something of a dilemma.

78
00:08:22,707 --> 00:08:24,751
I'Il do whatever I can to help.

79
00:08:25,668 --> 00:08:27,920
My husband's inner sanctum.

80
00:08:28,129 --> 00:08:30,714
Not many people have been
inside this room.

81
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:34,885
My father worked the Pittsburgh milI.

82
00:08:35,135 --> 00:08:37,220
Irving United Steel, I believe.

83
00:08:37,387 --> 00:08:39,806
But you attended Penn
on an academic scholarship.

84
00:08:40,015 --> 00:08:41,057
That's right.

85
00:08:41,182 --> 00:08:43,726
Peers went into Iaw and finance.
You chose surveillance.

86
00:08:43,893 --> 00:08:45,687
I decided it was the future.

87
00:08:46,062 --> 00:08:47,563
Your husband is a Iegend.

88
00:08:47,813 --> 00:08:48,731
Please.

89
00:08:48,981 --> 00:08:51,400
We were married 45 years.

90
00:08:51,692 --> 00:08:54,778
Four children, seven grandchildren.

91
00:08:55,154 --> 00:08:56,822
But his true passion Iay...

92
00:08:56,989 --> 00:08:58,240
...in his work.

93
00:08:58,573 --> 00:09:00,283
But he was always IoyaI.

94
00:09:00,492 --> 00:09:03,411
I Ioved him deeply.

95
00:09:03,786 --> 00:09:05,204
I understand.

96
00:09:07,456 --> 00:09:08,791
DanieI.

97
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,003
My husband was the only one
with the combination to this safe.

98
00:09:13,253 --> 00:09:14,838
We hired somebody to open it.

99
00:09:15,255 --> 00:09:17,215
I prevented anyone...

100
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:19,467
...from seeing the contents.

101
00:09:19,718 --> 00:09:22,679
I felt these were
my husband's private things.

102
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:24,013
I didn't....

103
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:27,683
I didn't realize....

104
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:30,686
Do you want to tell me
what you found?

105
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,149
Cash, stock certificates.

106
00:09:35,357 --> 00:09:39,444
Nothing out of the ordinary,
really, except that.

107
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,322
It's a film...

108
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,534
...where a girl appears to be murdered.

109
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,411
I'm not sure I understand.

110
00:09:48,619 --> 00:09:50,162
It's very realistic.

111
00:09:50,371 --> 00:09:53,332
But how many people seem to be
realistically killed...

112
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:55,542
...in movies and on TV every day?

113
00:09:56,335 --> 00:09:59,838
It begins as a relatively
sleazy bit of pornography...

114
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:02,966
...and rapidly turns
quite violent and bloody.

115
00:10:08,054 --> 00:10:10,598
What you're talking about
is called a snuff film.

116
00:10:10,848 --> 00:10:13,017
Snuff films are a kind of urban myth.

117
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:16,478
Sex industry folklore.
There's no such thing.

118
00:10:16,728 --> 00:10:18,480
That's what I explained
to Mrs. Christian.

119
00:10:18,688 --> 00:10:21,107
This is probably
an S & M film of some sort.

120
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:23,193
Simulated rape, simulated violence.

121
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:25,611
It's hard to stomach,
but there are ways of doing it.

122
00:10:25,862 --> 00:10:27,363
Fake blood, special effects.

123
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:30,658
Would you Iook at the film
and give us your opinion?

124
00:10:31,242 --> 00:10:32,368
All I want...

125
00:10:32,576 --> 00:10:36,705
...is to know that
this atrocity is false.

126
00:10:37,289 --> 00:10:38,957
I want the proof.

127
00:12:29,392 --> 00:12:30,267
WelI...

128
00:12:30,518 --> 00:12:33,520
...whoever made the film
was adept at authenticity.

129
00:12:33,771 --> 00:12:37,274
But I'm no expert.
Let the police make a determination.

130
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:38,275
Out of the question.

131
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:41,236
That'd be so unnecessary
for any number of reasons...

132
00:12:41,403 --> 00:12:44,447
...not the Ieast of which is
Mr. Christian's reputation.

133
00:12:46,074 --> 00:12:47,825
Find out who made this film...

134
00:12:48,117 --> 00:12:49,869
...and establish whether it's reaI.

135
00:12:50,202 --> 00:12:51,620
You can name your price.

136
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:55,415
You'Il be provided with
whatever you need to buy information.

137
00:12:57,751 --> 00:12:59,544
GirI's all I've got to go on.

138
00:12:59,753 --> 00:13:01,463
I could treat it
like a missing persons case.

139
00:13:01,671 --> 00:13:02,589
Understood.

140
00:13:02,797 --> 00:13:03,673
Of course...

141
00:13:03,923 --> 00:13:07,510
...we need to be assured
that you would not copy this film.

142
00:13:07,718 --> 00:13:09,512
You have my word on that.

143
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:11,805
But I'Il be dealing
directly with you...

144
00:13:12,014 --> 00:13:12,931
...and only you.

145
00:13:13,223 --> 00:13:14,933
Your relationship with
your attorney is your own.

146
00:13:15,184 --> 00:13:17,060
-No offense.
-None taken.

147
00:13:17,269 --> 00:13:20,397
I realize you've given this
careful consideration.

148
00:13:22,148 --> 00:13:23,191
You could have destroyed it.

149
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:25,985
Tell me the poor girl wasn't killed.

150
00:13:26,152 --> 00:13:27,403
Please?

151
00:13:27,737 --> 00:13:29,405
Find her alive.

152
00:13:29,739 --> 00:13:31,824
I'Il do the best I can, ma'am.

153
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:12,194
Cleveland?

154
00:14:12,444 --> 00:14:13,445
You just got home.

155
00:14:13,737 --> 00:14:16,323
I wish I could stay,
but this is the mortgage.

156
00:14:16,573 --> 00:14:17,949
It's Cindy's college money.

157
00:14:18,116 --> 00:14:20,368
If I do right by her,
with the circle she runs in...

158
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,870
...this could be a big break.

159
00:14:22,162 --> 00:14:23,538
Do we need a break?

160
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:25,623
Your father thinks we do.

161
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:31,212
So, what was Mrs. Christian Iike?

162
00:14:31,462 --> 00:14:34,798
Like you'd expect, I guess.
I feel sorry for her.

163
00:14:35,048 --> 00:14:36,049
It's a missing persons.

164
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:38,802
I told her I'd give it
a couple of weeks. Three.

165
00:14:39,427 --> 00:14:42,347
It can't take Ionger than that.
It's an outside shot.

166
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,559
That's all I can tell you.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.

167
00:14:47,226 --> 00:14:49,020
It's always that way.

168
00:14:50,229 --> 00:14:53,524
-She's awake. I'Il get her.
-I'Il be up in a sec.

169
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:23,176
-You're taking the gun?
-l won't need it.

170
00:15:23,343 --> 00:15:24,177
Don't take it.

171
00:15:24,344 --> 00:15:27,054
I won't wear it.
It's a precaution. Don't worry.

172
00:15:27,305 --> 00:15:29,807
Will you call me
when you get there, please?

173
00:15:44,904 --> 00:15:48,824
L 've been hired by a couple in
Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.

174
00:15:49,116 --> 00:15:52,244
A few days ago, they picked up
a girl hitchhiking off 81...

175
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,496
...a runaway, about 18, maybe.

176
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:58,333
They buy her a meal.
The doctor tries to convince her...

177
00:15:58,583 --> 00:16:00,669
... that, at least,
she should call home.

178
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:03,379
Not surprisingly, the girl ate,
excused herself...

179
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:05,131
...that was the Iast they saw of her.

180
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,301
We had a friend of mine
at the department work up a sketch.

181
00:16:08,718 --> 00:16:10,761
They want to see
if I can I.D. this girI...

182
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,055
...then pass along
a message to the parents...

183
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:15,182
...letting them know
the kid's alive.

184
00:16:16,183 --> 00:16:18,143
You don't mind if I run a check?

185
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,603
Go ahead.

186
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,981
You want it, you got it.
Knock yourself out.

187
00:16:23,189 --> 00:16:26,442
Anywhere from 850,000 to 1,000,000
missing every year.

188
00:16:26,734 --> 00:16:29,945
We got as much as we can on computer,
then it's the wet-thumb method.

189
00:16:30,154 --> 00:16:32,364
Files are by state
and year of disappearance.

190
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:35,075
Children are separate.
No eating or smoking.

191
00:16:35,325 --> 00:16:36,994
-There's coffee.
-Any good?

192
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:38,245
Horrible.

193
00:16:38,578 --> 00:16:40,413
L t'll be your best friend
after a few days...

194
00:16:40,622 --> 00:16:42,123
... if you last that long.

195
00:16:42,373 --> 00:16:43,541
Good luck.

196
00:16:47,253 --> 00:16:48,462
Honey, it's me.

197
00:16:48,754 --> 00:16:49,547
How are you?

198
00:16:49,797 --> 00:16:50,798
L 'm good.

199
00:16:51,048 --> 00:16:51,966
Where are you?

200
00:16:52,258 --> 00:16:54,927
L 'm still in Cleveland.
How's Cindy?

201
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:58,096
She's sweet.
She's sleeping.

202
00:16:58,388 --> 00:17:01,641
-l 'm missing you bigtime.
-Yeah, l miss you too.

203
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:04,352
L 'll call you tomorrow night.

204
00:17:05,103 --> 00:17:06,187
Good night.

205
00:17:06,396 --> 00:17:08,105
Good night, sweetheart.

206
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,479
Hello, Mrs. Christian?
Tom Welles.

207
00:17:52,771 --> 00:17:53,981
Here's where we stand.

208
00:17:54,148 --> 00:17:57,442
L checked the film stock.
l t's called Supralux 5-4-4.

209
00:17:57,818 --> 00:18:01,112
The company that made that
stock discontinued it in '92.

210
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:03,656
So the film was made prior to that?

211
00:18:03,823 --> 00:18:06,576
Yes. I'm probably being
overly thorough with this...

212
00:18:06,784 --> 00:18:09,787
...but you might dig up your husband's
financial records...

213
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:11,622
...about 6 or 7 years ago.

214
00:18:11,872 --> 00:18:14,416
See if there's anything
out of the ordinary.

215
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:18,086
This isn't a movie you drop off
at the one-hour photo.

216
00:18:18,295 --> 00:18:20,005
So you think it's one of a kind.

217
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:23,508
The film is what we've got.
There's no negative.

218
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:26,761
Unlike video, it's not
designed to be duplicated.

219
00:18:27,011 --> 00:18:29,013
Whatever this is,
l have a feeling...

220
00:18:29,221 --> 00:18:32,057
... there aren't many copies
floating around, if any.

221
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:35,769
L 'm looking for a girl
we're not even sure is missing.

222
00:18:35,936 --> 00:18:38,647
With this happening 6 or 7 years ago...

223
00:18:38,897 --> 00:18:42,942
... finding the guys who made this film
is going to be very difficult.

224
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:46,028
L know you can do it.
You're doing a wonderful job.

225
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,281
Please tell me you'll
continue the investigation.

226
00:18:49,573 --> 00:18:51,534
L will. l 'll keep trying for you.

227
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:54,119
You can count on me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.

228
00:18:55,537 --> 00:18:59,583
We can't come to the phone now,
so please leave a message at the beep.

229
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:00,834
Honey, it's me.

230
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:03,878
I'm sorry I forgot
to call Iast night.

231
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:05,713
I won't forget tonight.

232
00:19:05,963 --> 00:19:08,716
I've been gone a Iong time.
I hope I'Il be home soon.

233
00:19:08,924 --> 00:19:11,635
I Iove you, and I miss you.
We'Il talk tonight.

234
00:20:30,583 --> 00:20:32,418
You Iooking for Janet?

235
00:20:38,757 --> 00:20:40,634
Hello, Mrs. Mathews?

236
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:43,303
I'm Thomas Hart.
I'm a Iicensed investigator.

237
00:20:43,678 --> 00:20:46,931
I've been hired by the U.S. Resource
Centre, Missing Persons...

238
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,724
...as part of an internal audit.

239
00:20:48,933 --> 00:20:53,937
I'd Iike you to answer questions
about your daughter, Mary Anne.

240
00:20:54,188 --> 00:20:58,150
I spoke to your FBl contact
yesterday, Agent....

241
00:20:58,442 --> 00:20:59,860
NeiI. Neil Cole?

242
00:21:00,068 --> 00:21:04,239
Yes, Agent Cole. He told me
he'd call and Iet you know to expect me.

243
00:21:04,906 --> 00:21:06,574
He didn't calI?

244
00:21:12,538 --> 00:21:13,372
Is this you?

245
00:21:15,582 --> 00:21:17,501
You Iook about five years old.

246
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:18,794
A Iittle older.

247
00:21:19,002 --> 00:21:20,128
Sweet.

248
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:27,969
It's important that you don't
let this raise your expectations.

249
00:21:28,386 --> 00:21:31,639
It's not going to effect
any ongoing efforts.

250
00:21:32,306 --> 00:21:34,224
All I'm saying is, please know...

251
00:21:34,516 --> 00:21:37,144
...I'm not here to create
any false hope.

252
00:21:40,897 --> 00:21:43,900
We fought all the time,
Mary Anne and me...

253
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,234
...and her stepdad.

254
00:21:45,443 --> 00:21:47,069
She hated him...

255
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:49,280
...because he wasn't her real dad.

256
00:21:49,905 --> 00:21:52,825
Trouble here, trouble at schooI.

257
00:21:53,117 --> 00:21:54,118
Trouble.

258
00:21:54,618 --> 00:21:58,080
Didn't Iike rules.
Takes after me, I guess.

259
00:21:58,330 --> 00:22:00,415
I had to Iearn the hard way.

260
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,668
Can I speak to your husband?

261
00:22:03,877 --> 00:22:04,794
Her stepfather?

262
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:06,003
Dave?

263
00:22:06,254 --> 00:22:07,547
Gone.

264
00:22:08,005 --> 00:22:10,216
Two years after Mary Anne Ieft.

265
00:22:10,633 --> 00:22:13,552
All the time, she resented him.

266
00:22:13,802 --> 00:22:17,431
I Iost her because of him,
and then I Iost him.

267
00:22:17,973 --> 00:22:20,058
I'm the only one still here.

268
00:22:21,393 --> 00:22:23,228
Did Mary have a boyfriend?

269
00:22:23,353 --> 00:22:26,022
She was sneaking out with someone.

270
00:22:26,355 --> 00:22:28,274
She wouldn't tell me who.

271
00:22:28,482 --> 00:22:31,694
Coming home with hickeys,
lying all the time.

272
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:36,615
I am sorry to bring this up,
but in these circumstances...

273
00:22:36,907 --> 00:22:38,408
...with the stepfather...

274
00:22:38,658 --> 00:22:41,745
...were there any indications
of any sort of abuse?

275
00:22:41,953 --> 00:22:44,789
There was nothing Iike that.
The police and FBl asked.

276
00:22:44,956 --> 00:22:48,084
There wasn't anything Iike that.
She'd have told me.

277
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:50,878
I apologize. I had to ask.

278
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:56,174
Those are for her birthday.
One for every year she missed.

279
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:59,010
They'Il be waiting for her
when she comes back.

280
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:02,889
It's because I slapped her.

281
00:23:04,557 --> 00:23:05,600
I know.

282
00:23:07,310 --> 00:23:11,480
We was fighting about Dave,
and she was just pushing my buttons.

283
00:23:11,772 --> 00:23:13,065
And I slapped her.

284
00:23:14,983 --> 00:23:16,109
Jesus!

285
00:23:17,486 --> 00:23:18,695
Next day, she was gone.

286
00:23:19,946 --> 00:23:22,657
When kids run, they
almost always Ieave a note.

287
00:23:22,866 --> 00:23:23,950
It's guilt, usually.

288
00:23:24,158 --> 00:23:25,868
There wasn't one.

289
00:23:26,077 --> 00:23:27,119
Police Iooked.

290
00:23:27,328 --> 00:23:29,872
An abduction's one thing,
a runaway's another.

291
00:23:30,122 --> 00:23:33,250
Sometimes it's not the priority
for the police it should be.

292
00:23:33,625 --> 00:23:37,546
There wasn't anything.
Don't you think I wish there was?

293
00:23:37,921 --> 00:23:40,257
You're probably right,
but would you Iet me Iook?

294
00:23:41,966 --> 00:23:43,593
You tell me...

295
00:23:43,885 --> 00:23:45,887
...not to get my hopes up...

296
00:23:46,429 --> 00:23:49,306
...not to raise my expectations.

297
00:23:53,185 --> 00:23:54,436
Go ahead.

298
00:23:55,062 --> 00:23:56,355
I need a drink.

299
00:23:57,689 --> 00:23:58,982
Thank you.

300
00:25:42,827 --> 00:25:44,621
Dear Mom,
if you're reading this...

301
00:25:44,746 --> 00:25:47,707
... it means l called you
from Hollywood, California.

302
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:51,919
L left my diary behind because
l want you to see why l 'm leaving.

303
00:25:52,086 --> 00:25:53,754
L t's not because you hit me.

304
00:25:54,046 --> 00:25:56,965
L hid this so Dave the dickhead
wouldn't find it.

305
00:25:57,215 --> 00:25:59,176
Warren Anderson and me
are in love.

306
00:25:59,426 --> 00:26:01,636
L 'm going to start
a new life with him.

307
00:26:01,803 --> 00:26:03,638
His dad owns
that garage in town.

308
00:26:04,138 --> 00:26:06,682
But Warren has even bigger plans.

309
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:08,768
He'll become a star
in action movies.

310
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:11,687
He says l 'm prettier
than a lot of girls in movies.

311
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,105
L could be a star too.

312
00:26:13,605 --> 00:26:14,857
You want a drink?

313
00:26:15,232 --> 00:26:16,817
When we cruise into Hollywood...

314
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:21,446
...l 'll have fiery eyes that everyone
will notice, because l am in love.

315
00:26:23,656 --> 00:26:26,284
You were right.
I didn't find anything.

316
00:26:27,285 --> 00:26:28,411
Fixed you a drink.

317
00:26:28,703 --> 00:26:30,955
Thanks, no.
I've got work to do.

318
00:26:31,205 --> 00:26:33,040
I'Il stop by tomorrow night.

319
00:26:33,957 --> 00:26:36,335
We'll probably be married
by the time you read this.

320
00:26:37,711 --> 00:26:40,046
Don't come looking for me,
because l 'm not coming back.

321
00:26:40,213 --> 00:26:43,841
Maybe someday you'll see me
on TV or in magazines.

322
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,053
Don't worry about me.
Love, Mary Anne.

323
00:26:47,428 --> 00:26:49,055
Mr. Anderson?

324
00:26:51,265 --> 00:26:52,057
Who's asking?

325
00:26:52,266 --> 00:26:54,977
Tom Hart.
Excuse me not shaking hands.

326
00:26:55,769 --> 00:26:58,939
I'm Iooking for your son.
You've got a son named Warren, right?

327
00:26:59,189 --> 00:27:00,357
Sure.

328
00:27:01,358 --> 00:27:03,818
What's it about? You a cop?

329
00:27:04,068 --> 00:27:05,111
No, sir.

330
00:27:05,319 --> 00:27:08,572
Just a friend from a while back.
Owe him some money.

331
00:27:09,323 --> 00:27:11,033
You owe him money?

332
00:27:11,242 --> 00:27:12,451
That's a new one.

333
00:27:14,411 --> 00:27:16,788
You can Ieave it
right here if you want.

334
00:27:17,497 --> 00:27:20,166
If it's all the same,
I'd Iike to send it to him.

335
00:27:20,625 --> 00:27:22,043
California, right?

336
00:27:23,753 --> 00:27:25,213
California?

337
00:27:26,464 --> 00:27:29,675
Son, you know where
the Fayetteville Iockup is?

338
00:27:30,051 --> 00:27:31,969
That's where Warren is.

339
00:27:32,219 --> 00:27:34,638
Doing eight months on a B and E.

340
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:38,892
Thank you.

341
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:44,147
Yeah, man, I knew her.

342
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:47,900
Dumped that bitch right
before I moved to L.A.

343
00:27:48,317 --> 00:27:51,111
She shows up knocking at my door
like a fucking stalker.

344
00:27:51,654 --> 00:27:53,822
Told that bitch she could go to helI.

345
00:27:55,824 --> 00:27:56,908
Where'd she go?

346
00:27:58,827 --> 00:28:00,287
Hell, maybe.

347
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,957
I don't know and
l don't give a fuck, either.

348
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,336
She said she might work
at a titty bar or something.

349
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:11,380
Ask me, her tits
weren't all that great.

350
00:28:12,965 --> 00:28:14,425
Did you hear from her again?

351
00:28:16,677 --> 00:28:19,554
Because I fucked her
doesn't mean I wanted her there.

352
00:28:20,138 --> 00:28:23,308
She came to Hollywood to be
a big fucking movie star.

353
00:28:23,892 --> 00:28:26,352
And so did I.
Check me out now.

354
00:28:30,815 --> 00:28:33,525
Why don't you pass me
one of them smokes?

355
00:28:40,031 --> 00:28:41,241
I don't smoke.

356
00:28:45,661 --> 00:28:46,954
How you doing?

357
00:28:47,205 --> 00:28:48,122
L 'm okay.

358
00:28:48,331 --> 00:28:50,207
You don't sound okay.

359
00:28:50,624 --> 00:28:52,209
It's not easy.

360
00:28:52,418 --> 00:28:53,669
Why? What's going on?

361
00:28:54,002 --> 00:28:56,546
It's just tougher than
l thought it would be.

362
00:28:56,797 --> 00:28:57,964
Is it getting to you?

363
00:28:58,215 --> 00:28:59,758
L got a lead l can't drop.

364
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:01,801
I'm almost done.
I miss you.

365
00:29:02,302 --> 00:29:03,595
I miss you too.
I Iove you.

366
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:05,346
Give Cindy a kiss for me.

367
00:29:05,555 --> 00:29:08,599
Wait, I think she wants to say bye.
Say bye to Daddy.

368
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:11,352
Hi, sweetie. Hi, honey.

369
00:29:11,936 --> 00:29:12,936
Hi, Cinderella.

370
00:29:13,187 --> 00:29:15,355
She's touching the phone.

371
00:29:16,356 --> 00:29:18,733
You should see her face
at your voice.

372
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:20,277
I Iove you.

373
00:29:20,402 --> 00:29:22,987
I Iove you too. Bye.

374
00:29:25,239 --> 00:29:27,158
I was just making dinner.

375
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:30,286
I've made enough for two,
as it happens.

376
00:29:30,619 --> 00:29:32,413
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

377
00:29:32,705 --> 00:29:36,124
I wanted to Iet you know
l spoke to my people at the agency.

378
00:29:36,375 --> 00:29:39,211
I told them to keep
Mary Anne's case active.

379
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:41,796
WelI...

380
00:29:42,505 --> 00:29:45,633
...stay for a drink, at Ieast.

381
00:29:49,345 --> 00:29:50,846
You sure you're not hungry?

382
00:29:51,138 --> 00:29:53,891
It'd be nice to have a meal
without the TV on for once.

383
00:29:54,766 --> 00:29:56,268
I have a Iong drive ahead of me.

384
00:29:56,518 --> 00:29:59,312
It's one of the most
depressing things. Eating alone.

385
00:29:59,479 --> 00:30:02,899
I don't know why. You think
I'd be used to it by now.

386
00:30:13,492 --> 00:30:14,451
Mrs. Mathews?

387
00:30:15,786 --> 00:30:16,953
Janet.

388
00:30:18,288 --> 00:30:19,581
Do you ever consider....

389
00:30:20,081 --> 00:30:22,792
Do you realize that
Mary may never come back?

390
00:30:24,335 --> 00:30:26,337
I think about it every day.

391
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:28,506
Every time the phone rings...

392
00:30:28,673 --> 00:30:31,842
...every time, I still think it's her.

393
00:30:32,551 --> 00:30:34,720
She's all I think about.

394
00:30:36,346 --> 00:30:38,056
Can you tell me...

395
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:42,352
...if you had to make a choice,
if you were forced to choose...

396
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:46,230
...between imagining her
out there somewhere...

397
00:30:46,439 --> 00:30:49,442
...living a good Iife, being happy...

398
00:30:50,901 --> 00:30:52,444
...but you don't know...

399
00:30:53,153 --> 00:30:54,947
...you never find out...

400
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:58,283
...or the worst being true...

401
00:30:59,034 --> 00:31:00,744
...her being gone...

402
00:31:01,911 --> 00:31:03,454
...but you know.

403
00:31:04,289 --> 00:31:05,957
You finally know...

404
00:31:07,291 --> 00:31:09,001
...what's happened to her.

405
00:31:10,503 --> 00:31:12,129
What would I choose?

406
00:31:13,422 --> 00:31:14,381
Yes.

407
00:31:18,301 --> 00:31:20,136
I would choose to know.

408
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,515
I need to know.

409
00:31:31,147 --> 00:31:34,066
Excuse me,
l have to use your restroom.

410
00:32:25,822 --> 00:32:27,281
You're Ieaving.

411
00:32:32,244 --> 00:32:34,496
I'Il call you if I find anything out.

412
00:35:10,848 --> 00:35:11,849
How you doing?

413
00:35:12,975 --> 00:35:13,934
Big date tonight?

414
00:35:14,977 --> 00:35:16,395
Yeah, guess so.

415
00:35:16,687 --> 00:35:19,314
Could I interest you
in a battery-operated vagina?

416
00:35:20,106 --> 00:35:21,983
It's tempting, but no thanks.

417
00:35:22,275 --> 00:35:25,653
I'd hate to see you in one
of those everyday situations...

418
00:35:25,862 --> 00:35:28,864
...that calls for it
and you don't have one.

419
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:30,449
I'Il risk it.

420
00:35:31,951 --> 00:35:34,786
All right, your total
is $74.58, please.

421
00:35:38,165 --> 00:35:39,583
A hundred.

422
00:35:44,504 --> 00:35:48,174
TotaI's $25 and some change.

423
00:35:51,343 --> 00:35:54,012
Thank you for shopping
at Adult Bookstore.

424
00:35:54,179 --> 00:35:56,682
And have yourself a fabulous day.

425
00:35:56,974 --> 00:35:58,391
What are you reading?

426
00:36:00,977 --> 00:36:02,645
Catchy title.
What are you really reading?

427
00:36:02,896 --> 00:36:06,065
Hard to believe it's got
any parts worth highlighting.

428
00:36:09,193 --> 00:36:10,820
Capote.

429
00:36:12,738 --> 00:36:13,822
You know how it is.

430
00:36:14,448 --> 00:36:17,617
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
in front of your fellow perverts.

431
00:36:18,827 --> 00:36:21,871
I might get drummed out
of the pornographers' union.

432
00:36:22,122 --> 00:36:23,706
Where would I be then?

433
00:36:26,417 --> 00:36:28,085
Have a good day.

434
00:36:54,693 --> 00:36:55,819
How are you?

435
00:36:56,028 --> 00:36:57,529
Hey, honey.

436
00:36:57,863 --> 00:36:59,656
-How you doing?
-l 'm a little beat.

437
00:36:59,781 --> 00:37:00,657
How's Cindy?

438
00:37:00,865 --> 00:37:02,617
She's sweet. She misses you.

439
00:37:02,867 --> 00:37:04,410
How's it going?

440
00:37:04,994 --> 00:37:08,164
The way things are going,
I'm thinking about coming home.

441
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:09,415
Really?

442
00:37:11,041 --> 00:37:12,376
Honey, wait.

443
00:37:15,003 --> 00:37:16,546
Can I call you back?

444
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:19,925
L 'll call you right back, l promise.
Bye, honey.

445
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,380
Mrs. Christian, there were three men.

446
00:38:02,589 --> 00:38:05,008
Not just the cameraman
and the masked man.

447
00:38:05,633 --> 00:38:08,302
L caught a glimpse of a third man.
He was watching.

448
00:38:10,096 --> 00:38:12,598
L 'll get a clearer image
through computer enhancement.

449
00:38:12,848 --> 00:38:15,934
But this probably happened
6 years ago, so it's not--

450
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:17,936
All right, l 'll keep trying.

451
00:38:18,186 --> 00:38:20,897
Thank you, l appreciate
your support. Goodbye.

452
00:38:21,981 --> 00:38:25,026
What we have here is
137 billable man-hours...

453
00:38:25,276 --> 00:38:27,737
...a hundred-plus thousand
dollars machine...

454
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:32,366
...and the result is an enhancement
of the back of some guy's head.

455
00:38:34,243 --> 00:38:35,619
Want it framed?

456
00:38:37,204 --> 00:38:39,247
There you go. Have a nice day.

457
00:38:41,124 --> 00:38:44,127
It's Iike a gas station,
you pay before you pump.

458
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:46,504
Remember me?

459
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:51,842
Came back for the battery-operated
vagina after alI.

460
00:38:52,468 --> 00:38:54,720
I need information.
Maybe you can help.

461
00:38:54,928 --> 00:38:57,889
Thomas Welles. Nice picture.

462
00:38:58,348 --> 00:39:01,518
What sort of information?
I got all different kinds.

463
00:39:01,726 --> 00:39:02,769
The kind I'Il pay for.

464
00:39:03,811 --> 00:39:06,105
I don't know
what you're Iooking for...

465
00:39:06,355 --> 00:39:08,357
...so we're clear from the start,
I'm straight.

466
00:39:08,649 --> 00:39:09,734
Congratulations.

467
00:39:09,942 --> 00:39:11,068
Thank you.

468
00:39:11,235 --> 00:39:12,152
Zip it!

469
00:39:12,361 --> 00:39:13,654
I can hook you up.

470
00:39:13,862 --> 00:39:15,572
Name the vice,
l name the price.

471
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:19,242
-How Iong you been working here?
-Almost two years.

472
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:21,536
What's your name,
if you don't mind me asking?

473
00:39:21,828 --> 00:39:23,204
Max.

474
00:39:24,497 --> 00:39:25,415
Here's the deaI.

475
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:28,292
This thing has to do
with underground pornography.

476
00:39:28,584 --> 00:39:31,170
Stuff that's sold
under the counter, illegally.

477
00:39:31,378 --> 00:39:33,547
There's not much illegal out there.

478
00:39:33,714 --> 00:39:37,175
Whatever there is, I want to know.
I want a good Iook.

479
00:39:37,467 --> 00:39:41,096
If you've got that kind of
connection, great. If not, speak now.

480
00:39:41,471 --> 00:39:42,847
You're not a cop, are you?

481
00:39:43,056 --> 00:39:45,224
If I ask and you are,
you got to tell me.

482
00:39:45,391 --> 00:39:46,893
I'm not a cop.

483
00:39:47,768 --> 00:39:48,853
A private detective?

484
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:50,604
Like Shaft?

485
00:39:51,397 --> 00:39:54,024
You ever seen Private Dicks?
I got it on sale.

486
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:55,776
How much you make in there?

487
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:01,489
Around 400 bucks a week,
off the books.

488
00:40:01,656 --> 00:40:03,908
Let's pretend I Iive
in the same fantasy world...

489
00:40:04,117 --> 00:40:06,119
...where you make $400
a week in that dump.

490
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,454
I'Il give you 500 for a few days.

491
00:40:08,788 --> 00:40:09,914
Six sounds good, Pops.

492
00:40:10,164 --> 00:40:11,290
Five.

493
00:40:12,708 --> 00:40:14,293
Here's my number.

494
00:40:18,255 --> 00:40:19,923
When can you start?

495
00:40:20,382 --> 00:40:22,926
Well, tomorrow night I get off Iate.

496
00:40:23,885 --> 00:40:24,844
Tomorrow.

497
00:40:25,094 --> 00:40:25,970
All right.

498
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:29,056
And don't call me Pops.

499
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,726
Of course not. I wouldn't
want to hurt your feelings.

500
00:40:35,103 --> 00:40:36,938
L don't know what your scene is.

501
00:40:37,189 --> 00:40:38,940
You may like porn
as much as the next guy.

502
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:42,777
You don't look like your average
sleaze. More like your average cop.

503
00:40:42,986 --> 00:40:46,322
So when you ask people
about fucking illegal stuff...

504
00:40:46,614 --> 00:40:48,449
...it has a certain patina to it.

505
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:49,450
Patina.

506
00:40:49,784 --> 00:40:51,744
It's a Truman Capote word. Hello?

507
00:40:51,911 --> 00:40:55,455
If someone never sold a snuff film,
they shouldn't care what I ask.

508
00:40:55,706 --> 00:40:57,624
If they have,
they should be nervous.

509
00:40:57,833 --> 00:41:00,335
Whoever acts insulted,
knock on their door.

510
00:41:00,585 --> 00:41:04,339
Look, Pops, it's not too Iate
to change your mind about all this.

511
00:41:04,589 --> 00:41:07,258
There's things you'Il see
that you can't unsee.

512
00:41:07,466 --> 00:41:10,719
-They stay in your head.
-How do you know what I've seen?

513
00:41:10,928 --> 00:41:14,056
Okay, fine.
But everybody's got their Iimit.

514
00:41:14,264 --> 00:41:17,601
I've been here six fucking years
trying to get my music together.

515
00:41:17,893 --> 00:41:21,271
So I start part-time
where I work, to make ends meet.

516
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,857
And boom, a couple years go by,
and here I am.

517
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:28,611
I'm just saying, before you know it,
you're in it. Deep in it.

518
00:41:28,861 --> 00:41:30,362
Don't worry about me.

519
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,530
But thank you.

520
00:41:31,780 --> 00:41:33,365
You're welcome.

521
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:36,827
Pops, you dance with the devil,
the devil don't change.

522
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:38,829
Devil changes you.

523
00:41:39,204 --> 00:41:40,413
Some of your Iyrics?

524
00:41:40,622 --> 00:41:41,414
That's cute.

525
00:41:52,299 --> 00:41:54,343
This place has been around
about 3 years...

526
00:41:54,593 --> 00:41:56,928
...but they keep moving it
house to house.

527
00:42:12,693 --> 00:42:14,486
This is the tip of the iceberg.

528
00:42:14,778 --> 00:42:17,406
Lots of Mexican S & M,
lots of Asian bondage...

529
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:20,700
...all kinds of bestiality,
if you're into that.

530
00:42:20,909 --> 00:42:23,077
Don't touch nothing.
You want something, tell Friendly.

531
00:42:23,286 --> 00:42:24,245
Ask him.

532
00:42:36,298 --> 00:42:37,507
Don't do that!

533
00:42:37,799 --> 00:42:39,176
All right! It's cooI!

534
00:42:40,969 --> 00:42:41,970
All right? Okay.

535
00:42:49,935 --> 00:42:51,896
Come on, Iet's go. All right!

536
00:42:55,857 --> 00:42:58,693
Are you affiliated with Iaw enforcement?

537
00:42:58,902 --> 00:43:00,111
Fuck you, Larry.

538
00:43:00,403 --> 00:43:04,240
Are you a Iaw enforcement agent,
or affiliated with Iaw enforcement?

539
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:05,616
Fuck you, Larry.

540
00:43:05,867 --> 00:43:07,660
You're getting cool there, Welles.

541
00:43:07,868 --> 00:43:11,497
You got your porn zombies here.
Junkies for the hard stuff.

542
00:43:11,747 --> 00:43:13,874
But these sales
won't Iast much Ionger.

543
00:43:14,041 --> 00:43:16,126
It's risky,
and everything's on the Net.

544
00:43:16,335 --> 00:43:18,503
Chicken hawks swapping photos
with their modems.

545
00:43:18,795 --> 00:43:22,257
Then there's classified ads
with hidden codes, secret couriers...

546
00:43:22,465 --> 00:43:24,384
...wires through dummy corporations.

547
00:43:24,717 --> 00:43:27,720
If something's illegal, the buyers
are as far away as they can get.

548
00:43:27,929 --> 00:43:30,806
Nobody knows what nobody knows,
you know what I mean?

549
00:43:30,973 --> 00:43:32,349
How's it going, SamueI?

550
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,605
I'Il say hi to her.

551
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:40,815
How are you? I Iove that.

552
00:43:41,066 --> 00:43:43,568
It's the Michael Jackson Iook,
with the zippers.

553
00:44:14,429 --> 00:44:15,889
What are these?

554
00:44:16,807 --> 00:44:18,600
Extreme bondage.

555
00:44:18,892 --> 00:44:20,393
Rape films.

556
00:44:21,311 --> 00:44:22,812
Sick shit.

557
00:44:23,229 --> 00:44:25,857
Buy five, get one for free.

558
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:28,984
Anything harder?

559
00:44:29,235 --> 00:44:31,362
There's nothing harder.

560
00:44:32,154 --> 00:44:33,155
Snuff?

561
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:38,368
There's no such thing as snuff.

562
00:44:38,869 --> 00:44:40,954
What you see is what I got, mister.

563
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:43,122
Do you know where I can get some?

564
00:44:43,289 --> 00:44:44,999
Fuck off.

565
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:32,376
There she is.

566
00:45:32,668 --> 00:45:35,629
There she is.
It's Double Slap Dorothy.

567
00:45:35,837 --> 00:45:37,964
That chick could be
a baseball player.

568
00:45:38,215 --> 00:45:39,841
The swing on her is unreaI.

569
00:45:41,009 --> 00:45:44,470
Some of these S & M and bondage films
you'Il see straddle the Iine.

570
00:45:44,762 --> 00:45:46,264
Foot fetish, orgies, shit films...

571
00:45:46,597 --> 00:45:48,974
...hermaphrodites, mutilation.
It's harder than hard-core.

572
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:50,392
But mostly IegaI.

573
00:45:50,559 --> 00:45:51,393
Stick.

574
00:45:51,644 --> 00:45:52,936
One guy sees it and pukes.

575
00:45:53,228 --> 00:45:56,064
Another guy sees it
and he falls in Iove.

576
00:45:57,024 --> 00:46:00,110
This is the guy I told you about.
Got the tapes?

577
00:46:01,277 --> 00:46:02,112
$1000.

578
00:46:02,320 --> 00:46:04,447
-1200 for the two.
-You told Max 1000.

579
00:46:04,739 --> 00:46:08,909
I know. This is more fun. I raise
the price, you get pissed off.

580
00:46:09,118 --> 00:46:11,328
-l thought we had a relationship.
-ls it reaI?

581
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:14,123
Sickest shit you'Il ever see.

582
00:46:19,044 --> 00:46:20,003
Is that reaI?

583
00:46:21,379 --> 00:46:23,464
That sure as shit Iooks reaI.

584
00:46:30,596 --> 00:46:32,348
She's not breathing.

585
00:46:41,231 --> 00:46:42,816
Who makes these films?

586
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:44,317
I don't know.

587
00:46:44,776 --> 00:46:46,652
Looks Iike the Philippines.

588
00:46:51,323 --> 00:46:53,909
Yeah, definitely the Philippines.

589
00:47:15,929 --> 00:47:18,390
Wait a minute.
That's the same girI.

590
00:47:18,598 --> 00:47:20,058
Isn't that the same girI?

591
00:47:20,392 --> 00:47:21,351
Look.

592
00:47:22,977 --> 00:47:24,187
It is the same.

593
00:47:24,270 --> 00:47:25,438
They're fakes.

594
00:47:27,982 --> 00:47:29,567
That's great.

595
00:47:31,110 --> 00:47:34,113
Snuff 2.: The Resurrection.

596
00:47:34,446 --> 00:47:35,906
Oh, boy.

597
00:47:36,073 --> 00:47:38,492
Well, what do you expect for 1200?

598
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:43,580
You want a beer or something?
I could use anything.

599
00:47:45,164 --> 00:47:48,292
But I'm sorry, man.
I told you snuff was bogus.

600
00:47:48,584 --> 00:47:51,212
I just wish I would have
gotten you a receipt.

601
00:47:51,670 --> 00:47:52,796
" Hard Spank."

602
00:47:53,547 --> 00:47:55,382
" Max California."

603
00:47:55,591 --> 00:47:57,467
That's my old band.

604
00:47:57,717 --> 00:47:58,969
We broke up.

605
00:47:59,135 --> 00:48:00,220
When?

606
00:48:00,512 --> 00:48:02,305
Maybe about a year ago.

607
00:48:03,514 --> 00:48:05,808
I don't mean any offense...

608
00:48:06,100 --> 00:48:08,394
...but what are you doing
mixed up in all this?

609
00:48:09,228 --> 00:48:12,064
I'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.

610
00:48:12,231 --> 00:48:14,775
You strike me as being smart enough
to do something else.

611
00:48:15,651 --> 00:48:16,860
Thanks.

612
00:48:17,069 --> 00:48:19,404
I wish you owned a record IabeI.

613
00:48:20,113 --> 00:48:22,657
Look, it beats pumping gas.

614
00:48:23,199 --> 00:48:25,660
I don't buy it.
I don't endorse it.

615
00:48:26,285 --> 00:48:27,578
I just point the way.

616
00:48:28,871 --> 00:48:30,372
You said it gets to you.

617
00:48:30,664 --> 00:48:31,916
Well, hell, yeah.

618
00:48:32,249 --> 00:48:34,626
Parade of Iosers I see every day?

619
00:48:34,751 --> 00:48:36,461
What choices have I got?

620
00:48:36,670 --> 00:48:40,674
The music industry is not exactly
beating down my door.

621
00:48:41,674 --> 00:48:44,427
And what about you, Tom Welles?

622
00:48:44,802 --> 00:48:48,055
You got a ring on your finger.
You got kids?

623
00:48:48,389 --> 00:48:49,640
A daughter.

624
00:48:51,350 --> 00:48:53,352
So you got a wife and a daughter...

625
00:48:53,685 --> 00:48:55,395
...and a nice Iittle yellow house...

626
00:48:55,687 --> 00:48:57,689
...and a dog named Shep.

627
00:48:58,023 --> 00:49:00,150
What the hell are you doing here?

628
00:49:02,986 --> 00:49:04,404
Good question.

629
00:49:07,031 --> 00:49:08,949
Do you get turned on
at places Iike tonight?

630
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:11,994
No, I am not.

631
00:49:12,202 --> 00:49:14,413
You don't exactly
get turned off, either.

632
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:18,708
DeviI's changing you already.

633
00:49:19,209 --> 00:49:20,710
Good night, Max.

634
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:01,664
This gentleman was asking if anyone
recognizes this girI.

635
00:50:03,541 --> 00:50:04,709
Yes.

636
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:06,252
I remember Mary.

637
00:50:06,419 --> 00:50:08,212
Mary Anne Mathews?

638
00:50:09,588 --> 00:50:13,258
She Iived here for only about a month,
if I recall correctly.

639
00:50:13,425 --> 00:50:17,179
She didn't return one night.
Do you know what happened to her?

640
00:50:17,429 --> 00:50:20,265
Not yet, but I'm Iooking
into it for her parents.

641
00:50:20,432 --> 00:50:23,101
Could you get
that flowered one down for me?

642
00:50:23,726 --> 00:50:24,977
That's her suitcase.

643
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:28,272
I'd forgotten about it
till you showed me her picture.

644
00:50:29,148 --> 00:50:32,860
I suppose I always
hoped she'd be back.

645
00:50:33,110 --> 00:50:34,862
She seemed so Iost.

646
00:50:35,112 --> 00:50:38,698
After a time, all I could do was pray
she'd moved on to better things.

647
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,909
Can you get this suitcase
to her people?

648
00:50:41,034 --> 00:50:42,243
If it's appropriate.

649
00:50:42,494 --> 00:50:43,870
Yes, of course. Thank you.

650
00:51:27,285 --> 00:51:29,203
Starlight, star bright

651
00:51:29,453 --> 00:51:31,121
First star l 've seen tonight

652
00:51:31,413 --> 00:51:33,540
l wish l may, wish l might

653
00:51:33,707 --> 00:51:35,876
Have this wish l wish tonight

654
00:51:40,714 --> 00:51:43,967
The number you have reached
is no longer in service.

655
00:51:45,802 --> 00:51:48,387
Hello, Hollywood Wax Museum.
Can l help you?

656
00:51:49,638 --> 00:51:51,932
This is operator 149.
What city and listing?

657
00:51:52,224 --> 00:51:54,184
L don't know. Hollywood.

658
00:51:54,643 --> 00:51:57,396
A listing for Celebrity Films,
and l need an address.

659
00:51:57,771 --> 00:52:00,065
Please hold for
phone number and address.

660
00:52:23,336 --> 00:52:26,130
-l was here first.
-Sorry, I'Il just be a couple minutes.

661
00:52:29,008 --> 00:52:29,967
Eddie Poole?

662
00:52:30,926 --> 00:52:32,303
A process server?

663
00:52:32,553 --> 00:52:36,682
No, I've been inquiring around if,
by any chance, you've seen this girI.

664
00:52:37,265 --> 00:52:38,058
You a cop?

665
00:52:38,433 --> 00:52:40,060
I'm a member of her family.

666
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:42,228
You know how much pussy
comes through here?

667
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:46,107
Please, if you'd just take a Iook.
It would've been a few years.

668
00:52:54,990 --> 00:52:57,200
Her name is Mary Anne Mathews.

669
00:52:59,786 --> 00:53:01,121
Never seen her.

670
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:03,623
You sure?

671
00:53:04,540 --> 00:53:06,918
I just Iooked
at the picture, didn't I?

672
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:09,545
Come on. I got
a Iot of shit to do.

673
00:53:13,424 --> 00:53:14,591
Who's next?

674
00:53:45,745 --> 00:53:47,163
This'Il be fine.

675
00:54:26,324 --> 00:54:28,200
What kind of shit are you peddling?

676
00:54:28,492 --> 00:54:30,619
My tapes sell.
People eat the shit up.

677
00:54:30,786 --> 00:54:33,455
L had three jerks
returning your tapes last month.

678
00:54:33,664 --> 00:54:36,750
You know how bad it has to be
for a jackass to come back...

679
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:39,920
... with a receipt
and try to fucking return it?

680
00:54:40,086 --> 00:54:41,046
How bad?

681
00:54:41,254 --> 00:54:45,008
Get together some upscale product
where the girls still have teeth.

682
00:54:45,842 --> 00:54:48,260
Till then, fuck you!

683
00:54:48,678 --> 00:54:50,095
Does your mother have any teeth?

684
00:54:50,346 --> 00:54:52,473
L f she does,
send her down, you fuck.

685
00:55:54,738 --> 00:55:56,448
He's not answering.

686
00:56:22,597 --> 00:56:23,723
Hey, boss.

687
00:56:23,932 --> 00:56:25,933
There's a case of beer in there.

688
00:56:30,146 --> 00:56:32,439
-How was your day?
-Great.

689
00:56:34,233 --> 00:56:37,027
-Everybody here?
-Everybody but one of the chicks.

690
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,653
Been watching them?

691
00:57:51,845 --> 00:57:53,514
Celebrity Films.

692
00:57:54,890 --> 00:57:56,350
I know all about it.

693
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:57,851
Yeah, you know about what?

694
00:57:58,101 --> 00:57:59,561
About that girI...

695
00:57:59,936 --> 00:58:01,604
...six years ago.

696
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:04,023
I know what you did to her.

697
00:58:05,191 --> 00:58:06,192
Who is this?

698
00:58:06,359 --> 00:58:07,860
You murdered her.

699
00:58:08,235 --> 00:58:10,112
You and your friends.

700
00:58:11,071 --> 00:58:13,198
What the fuck are
you talking about?

701
00:58:13,449 --> 00:58:14,783
You killed her on film.

702
00:58:15,117 --> 00:58:16,368
Now you're fucked.

703
00:58:16,660 --> 00:58:18,328
You're all fucked.

704
00:58:32,174 --> 00:58:33,384
Come on.

705
00:58:39,556 --> 00:58:41,266
Come on, give me something, Eddie.

706
00:58:53,735 --> 00:58:54,820
L t's me.

707
00:58:55,779 --> 00:58:57,030
What do you want?

708
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,532
L just got a call.

709
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,326
We got to talk.
And not on the phone.

710
00:59:01,534 --> 00:59:04,370
So one of us
has to get on a plane, all right?

711
00:59:04,579 --> 00:59:07,373
Blow me, you paranoid fuck.

712
00:59:10,751 --> 00:59:12,461
Fuck! Fuck!

713
00:59:22,595 --> 00:59:24,889
So you Iike to watch, paranoid fuck.

714
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:35,566
Phone is listed under "D. Velvet"
in Manhattan.

715
00:59:35,816 --> 00:59:36,692
Dino Velvet.

716
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:39,945
He's a producerl directorl weirdo.

717
00:59:40,111 --> 00:59:41,696
He's Iike the Jim Jarmusch of S & M.

718
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:43,072
How hard is his stuff?

719
00:59:43,364 --> 00:59:44,449
How hard do you want it?

720
00:59:44,699 --> 00:59:48,244
Bondage, fetish, Gothic hard-core.
Definitely not for the squeamish.

721
00:59:48,452 --> 00:59:49,912
Kind of hard to come by.

722
00:59:50,204 --> 00:59:52,539
Mostly out of the back
of bondage magazines.

723
00:59:52,831 --> 00:59:54,082
But he's got fans.

724
00:59:54,291 --> 00:59:56,460
This guy I know, he thinks it's art.

725
00:59:56,752 --> 00:59:59,963
He's told me Velvet will do
commissions if there's enough dough.

726
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:02,132
Nothing illegal, but borderline.

727
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:05,134
If a guy wants to see
a transvestite in a rubber suit--

728
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:06,469
I got the picture.

729
01:00:06,761 --> 01:00:08,804
Max, get in here!

730
01:00:09,764 --> 01:00:11,015
So...

731
01:00:11,307 --> 01:00:12,766
...you're going to New York?

732
01:00:12,891 --> 01:00:14,059
Maybe.

733
01:00:14,768 --> 01:00:16,436
Looking Iike that.

734
01:00:16,978 --> 01:00:18,313
You'Il need me.

735
01:00:18,605 --> 01:00:21,816
This Frenchie guy is more
than just a fan of Velvet films.

736
01:00:22,025 --> 01:00:23,610
I can get you in if you want.

737
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:25,570
For more money, of course.

738
01:00:25,778 --> 01:00:28,489
Plus expenses. I fly first class.

739
01:00:28,739 --> 01:00:30,324
So when are we Ieaving?

740
01:00:35,078 --> 01:00:36,330
What are you doing?

741
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,583
Man, my first time in
the Big Bad Apple.

742
01:00:43,127 --> 01:00:45,046
I told you, don't film me.

743
01:00:45,213 --> 01:00:47,757
Fine, Howard Hughes.

744
01:00:57,641 --> 01:00:59,726
You didn't say it'd be this Iuxurious.

745
01:00:59,935 --> 01:01:03,021
-lt's the Presidential suite.
-A comforting sense of humour.

746
01:01:03,229 --> 01:01:05,023
I'Il be a couple of doors down.

747
01:01:05,273 --> 01:01:08,067
Tom, I don't know why
we're staying in this fleabag.

748
01:01:08,317 --> 01:01:10,444
People mind their own
business in fleabags.

749
01:01:10,694 --> 01:01:13,697
I'm going out. Dig up
whatever Velvet tapes you can find.

750
01:01:13,947 --> 01:01:14,698
Get receipts.

751
01:01:16,199 --> 01:01:17,284
Yes, sir.

752
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:21,246
My husband had
five cash accounts he used.

753
01:01:21,496 --> 01:01:23,039
Between November...

754
01:01:23,206 --> 01:01:24,957
...of 1992...

755
01:01:25,541 --> 01:01:26,834
...and March...

756
01:01:27,043 --> 01:01:29,170
...of 1993...

757
01:01:29,378 --> 01:01:33,006
...he wrote one check out
to cash from each account.

758
01:01:34,299 --> 01:01:37,302
My husband never dealt
with money personally.

759
01:01:37,594 --> 01:01:38,970
Certainly not cash.

760
01:01:39,262 --> 01:01:41,931
These checks he wrote
are for very odd amounts.

761
01:01:42,140 --> 01:01:45,143
When totalled together,
the five checks...

762
01:01:45,393 --> 01:01:50,147
...from the five different accounts,
they equal $1 million.

763
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:52,816
That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.

764
01:01:53,067 --> 01:01:55,110
I only mentioned this because...

765
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:58,113
...you asked me to Iook
for anything unusuaI.

766
01:01:58,321 --> 01:02:00,782
I've got about $5000 Ieft in cash.

767
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:04,452
I'Il need another 50, if you approve
the plan I mentioned earlier.

768
01:02:04,786 --> 01:02:08,122
I'm very close to identifying
the man in the mask.

769
01:02:08,331 --> 01:02:10,541
I'Il have Mr. Longdale arrange it.

770
01:02:10,749 --> 01:02:12,626
How will l get it to you?

771
01:02:12,751 --> 01:02:14,711
I'Il give you the address.

772
01:02:14,878 --> 01:02:18,256
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

773
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,579
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

774
01:03:19,187 --> 01:03:21,981
Who is this?
In the mask, who is he?

775
01:03:22,941 --> 01:03:24,567
Come on, wake up.
Who is this?

776
01:03:24,859 --> 01:03:28,279
One of Dino's Iunatics.
He's in a bunch of these.

777
01:03:28,487 --> 01:03:29,363
What's his name?

778
01:03:29,697 --> 01:03:32,241
I don't know.
That's his whole thing.

779
01:03:32,616 --> 01:03:34,409
He always wears a mask.

780
01:03:34,785 --> 01:03:37,454
He calls himself Machete--
No, Machine.

781
01:03:37,746 --> 01:03:40,373
He calls himself Machine.

782
01:03:41,916 --> 01:03:43,960
He's a Iover, man.

783
01:03:44,210 --> 01:03:47,338
Definitely Ioves
what he does for a Iiving.

784
01:03:48,214 --> 01:03:50,174
Can't say the same about you.

785
01:04:00,433 --> 01:04:01,935
Yes, yes.

786
01:04:03,394 --> 01:04:06,105
You can see they really
appreciate my style here.

787
01:04:06,314 --> 01:04:10,234
I'm not the kind to blend in
with the crowd, if you didn't notice.

788
01:04:10,526 --> 01:04:12,945
Like these Iadies here,
they Iike my style.

789
01:04:18,116 --> 01:04:19,034
Who is it?

790
01:04:19,200 --> 01:04:20,994
This is Max California.

791
01:04:21,161 --> 01:04:23,913
I called earlier.
I'm a friend of Frenchie's, from L.A.

792
01:04:24,122 --> 01:04:26,958
My partner and I would Iike
to speak to Mr. Velvet.

793
01:04:27,250 --> 01:04:28,501
He's not here.

794
01:04:29,085 --> 01:04:31,170
We have to give him
a Iarge sum of money.

795
01:04:31,420 --> 01:04:33,589
If he's not interested, we'Il split.

796
01:04:50,729 --> 01:04:52,439
What are you talking about?

797
01:04:52,731 --> 01:04:56,151
Can't you just answer
my simple question?

798
01:04:57,611 --> 01:05:01,114
I asked you a question!
Where the fuck is Laura?!

799
01:05:01,489 --> 01:05:04,242
I've been asking you that
the Iast 10 minutes.

800
01:05:04,492 --> 01:05:06,827
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

801
01:05:07,245 --> 01:05:08,287
You idiot!

802
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:10,498
Going to shoot in two days?

803
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:12,833
Man, you're spending my money.

804
01:05:13,083 --> 01:05:15,002
Yeah, you better do that.

805
01:05:15,586 --> 01:05:17,170
Fucking asshole!

806
01:05:17,421 --> 01:05:20,006
It's an honour to meet you.
Thank you for seeing us.

807
01:05:21,508 --> 01:05:22,634
God!

808
01:05:25,178 --> 01:05:26,846
So, what can I do you for?

809
01:05:27,096 --> 01:05:31,767
We'd Iike to commission a film.
A Dino Velvet original, one of a kind.

810
01:05:32,267 --> 01:05:33,519
That's right.

811
01:05:34,061 --> 01:05:36,146
I'm a huge admirer of yours.

812
01:05:36,313 --> 01:05:38,565
God, I Iove flattery.

813
01:05:39,107 --> 01:05:41,985
You're a genius, Mr. Velvet.
A goddamn genius.

814
01:05:42,152 --> 01:05:44,362
The only one still transferring
film to video.

815
01:05:44,654 --> 01:05:47,698
Nobody really appreciates
that kind of integrity anymore.

816
01:05:47,949 --> 01:05:50,993
The grain and the gritty Iook you get.

817
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:54,788
Which is your favourite?

818
01:05:54,913 --> 01:05:58,291
If I had to choose, it'd either be
Choke or Devil.

819
01:05:59,042 --> 01:06:02,921
The subliminal imagery in Choke
is what gets under your skin.

820
01:06:03,963 --> 01:06:07,967
Well, Devil frightened me
as much as it excited me...

821
01:06:08,217 --> 01:06:10,761
...but I'd be hard-pressed
to choose a favourite.

822
01:06:15,140 --> 01:06:17,934
What kind of a budget
are we talking about?

823
01:06:18,977 --> 01:06:23,064
Five thousand now.
Five thousand upon delivery.

824
01:06:23,231 --> 01:06:25,316
Two women. One white, one black.

825
01:06:25,858 --> 01:06:27,818
Hard bondage, of course.

826
01:06:28,194 --> 01:06:29,820
Other than that, trusting...

827
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:31,947
...your artistic interpretation...

828
01:06:32,156 --> 01:06:34,575
...l only have two stipulations.

829
01:06:39,246 --> 01:06:40,664
Challenge me.

830
01:06:42,207 --> 01:06:43,958
I want to watch you work.

831
01:06:44,792 --> 01:06:47,420
You don't want a franchise, do you?

832
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,714
Steal the recipe for my secret...

833
01:06:50,965 --> 01:06:53,050
...hot sauce?

834
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,135
No.

835
01:06:57,137 --> 01:06:58,180
That's good.

836
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,348
I appreciate that.

837
01:07:05,395 --> 01:07:06,854
Second stipulation.

838
01:07:07,021 --> 01:07:08,773
The other performer...

839
01:07:09,398 --> 01:07:11,150
...has to be...

840
01:07:11,317 --> 01:07:13,110
...that animal you use.

841
01:07:13,277 --> 01:07:14,903
The man in the mask.

842
01:07:16,321 --> 01:07:17,656
Machine.

843
01:07:24,537 --> 01:07:25,955
I don't know.

844
01:07:26,831 --> 01:07:28,541
He might be interested.

845
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:32,753
But I think it'Il cost you another...

846
01:07:35,172 --> 01:07:37,132
...five to seven grand.

847
01:07:37,549 --> 01:07:40,135
I can arrange something
really special for ten.

848
01:07:40,593 --> 01:07:41,970
You can do that.

849
01:07:42,095 --> 01:07:43,554
Good enough for me.

850
01:07:45,139 --> 01:07:49,143
I'Il just have to put
my thinking cap on.

851
01:07:52,771 --> 01:07:56,024
I'm going to keep this as a deposit.

852
01:07:56,191 --> 01:07:59,069
You make sure you call me
after 10 o'clock tonight.

853
01:07:59,277 --> 01:08:00,945
10 o'clock.

854
01:08:04,741 --> 01:08:08,911
You know, you have a very special,
very beautiful face.

855
01:08:09,161 --> 01:08:11,288
The way Iight hits it.

856
01:08:11,956 --> 01:08:13,749
I'd Iike to shoot you.

857
01:08:14,708 --> 01:08:15,709
You don't mind?

858
01:08:16,877 --> 01:08:18,211
I'm camera-shy.

859
01:08:18,628 --> 01:08:21,339
You trust me to take your money,
but not your picture?

860
01:08:21,548 --> 01:08:23,925
Those are two different
kinds of trust.

861
01:08:24,425 --> 01:08:26,427
I hope we can do business.

862
01:08:34,893 --> 01:08:38,188
Hoyt Avenue, Brooklyn, 3 o'clock.

863
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,066
I'Il be there.

864
01:08:44,986 --> 01:08:47,280
I got something to tend to. Thanks.

865
01:08:48,072 --> 01:08:50,324
So are we in the movie business?

866
01:08:51,325 --> 01:08:52,284
That's for you.

867
01:08:52,576 --> 01:08:53,619
-What is it?
-Money.

868
01:08:53,827 --> 01:08:55,287
People use it to purchase goods.

869
01:08:55,579 --> 01:08:57,998
That's awfully generous and everything--

870
01:08:58,206 --> 01:09:00,125
It's not mine.
Don't make a big deaI.

871
01:09:00,375 --> 01:09:04,128
There's a plane ticket for the flight
you can catch to L.A. tonight.

872
01:09:04,420 --> 01:09:06,297
This is as far as I want you to go.

873
01:09:06,464 --> 01:09:08,090
What are you talking about?

874
01:09:08,341 --> 01:09:09,759
We're a team.
We're partners.

875
01:09:10,092 --> 01:09:14,721
Max, I'm sure you realize
these people we're dealing with...

876
01:09:15,639 --> 01:09:17,099
...are extremely disturbed.

877
01:09:17,265 --> 01:09:20,268
That's why you need me.
I know disturbed. Look at me.

878
01:09:20,393 --> 01:09:23,271
You did a great job.
It's time for you to go home.

879
01:09:23,479 --> 01:09:25,314
But this is, Iike, our big case.

880
01:09:25,565 --> 01:09:28,401
Tom, I know what's going on, okay?

881
01:09:28,901 --> 01:09:30,069
Okay, what?

882
01:09:30,236 --> 01:09:33,072
Dino and Machine and Eddie
made a snuff film, right?

883
01:09:33,322 --> 01:09:36,783
I can't figure out why you're involved.
Maybe the victim--?

884
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:38,243
First, who said you're right?

885
01:09:38,535 --> 01:09:40,954
Second, who said
anything about a victim?

886
01:09:41,121 --> 01:09:43,122
Only 3 rules in Iife, Tom Welles.

887
01:09:43,414 --> 01:09:46,501
One, there's always a victim.
And two, don't be it.

888
01:09:46,751 --> 01:09:47,585
And three?

889
01:09:47,752 --> 01:09:48,794
I forgot three.

890
01:09:49,003 --> 01:09:51,130
Good, I want you to forget everything.

891
01:09:51,338 --> 01:09:54,424
I want you to get on a plane to L.A.
and forget it alI.

892
01:09:55,717 --> 01:10:00,138
I get calls for work on the West Coast.
I'd Iike to call you again.

893
01:10:00,305 --> 01:10:02,557
You're going to Iook me up
and call me?

894
01:10:02,724 --> 01:10:06,519
I could use your help. I meant it
when I said I think you're smart.

895
01:10:06,769 --> 01:10:08,813
I'm not patronizing you.

896
01:10:09,063 --> 01:10:10,314
Well, thanks.

897
01:10:10,606 --> 01:10:13,233
All right.
You take care, Max California.

898
01:10:19,322 --> 01:10:22,200
All right, Tom Welles.
DeviI's waiting on you.

899
01:11:41,564 --> 01:11:43,316
There you are.

900
01:11:43,650 --> 01:11:45,610
Come and join us.

901
01:11:56,787 --> 01:11:58,330
Hello, Machine.

902
01:11:59,331 --> 01:12:00,206
Love your work.

903
01:12:05,420 --> 01:12:08,047
Did you bring the money?

904
01:12:09,298 --> 01:12:10,674
It's right here.

905
01:12:10,883 --> 01:12:11,842
Good.

906
01:12:13,218 --> 01:12:14,595
Where are the women?

907
01:12:14,761 --> 01:12:16,138
Women...

908
01:12:17,180 --> 01:12:19,099
...they're always Iate.

909
01:12:25,688 --> 01:12:27,315
What are these for?

910
01:12:27,607 --> 01:12:29,650
They're just props.

911
01:12:29,859 --> 01:12:31,944
Nice, aren't they?

912
01:12:32,236 --> 01:12:36,114
Machine and I were just talking
about the beauty of knives.

913
01:12:39,284 --> 01:12:42,162
My guests have arrived!

914
01:12:44,247 --> 01:12:49,085
Mr. W., would you be so kind as
to remove any firearms from your person?

915
01:12:49,835 --> 01:12:50,836
What are you doing?

916
01:12:51,962 --> 01:12:54,631
I hate to repeat myself.
It makes me Iook so stupid.

917
01:12:55,215 --> 01:12:56,299
Slowly.

918
01:12:56,633 --> 01:12:58,718
Please, show me your gun.

919
01:12:59,761 --> 01:13:01,137
Nice and easy!

920
01:13:02,555 --> 01:13:04,599
That's right. Easy.

921
01:13:04,891 --> 01:13:06,434
Good.

922
01:13:06,767 --> 01:13:09,520
Now empty those bullets
onto the table.

923
01:13:09,812 --> 01:13:11,230
Very carefully.

924
01:13:11,397 --> 01:13:14,399
-l don't know why you think--
-Shut up, you fuck!

925
01:13:14,858 --> 01:13:18,987
I'Il put an arrow right through
your goddamn throat, you understand?

926
01:13:24,867 --> 01:13:26,035
That's him.

927
01:13:27,036 --> 01:13:28,412
Last bullet.
The Iast one.

928
01:13:29,163 --> 01:13:30,206
Good boy.

929
01:13:30,456 --> 01:13:33,000
Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.

930
01:13:33,375 --> 01:13:34,710
Yes, sir.

931
01:13:34,877 --> 01:13:36,211
Machine!

932
01:13:42,717 --> 01:13:45,553
I didn't know what
to make of you at first.

933
01:13:47,597 --> 01:13:51,558
And you certainly had Eddie here
on pins and needles.

934
01:13:53,185 --> 01:13:55,979
Lo and behold,
from right out of the blue came...

935
01:13:56,188 --> 01:14:00,442
...an old business acquaintance of ours
to explain everything.

936
01:14:00,775 --> 01:14:03,695
Satan ex machina.

937
01:14:04,821 --> 01:14:07,323
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

938
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:11,160
Get it over with.

939
01:14:11,368 --> 01:14:13,412
Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

940
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:18,416
What I could do with faces
like these on film.

941
01:14:19,251 --> 01:14:22,712
But on second thought,
why would I need their faces?

942
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:25,089
You Iisten to me.

943
01:14:25,339 --> 01:14:26,799
You'Il get that film.

944
01:14:27,008 --> 01:14:29,760
You'Il bring it back here,
give it to me.

945
01:14:29,969 --> 01:14:34,223
Just so we make this
as efficient as possible...

946
01:14:34,431 --> 01:14:36,933
...there is an incentive.

947
01:14:47,485 --> 01:14:49,570
He's got nothing to do with this.

948
01:14:49,779 --> 01:14:51,447
He doesn't know anything.

949
01:14:51,697 --> 01:14:55,367
Can't you guess
what I'm about to say next?!

950
01:14:56,910 --> 01:14:59,204
If you don't bring me that film...

951
01:14:59,454 --> 01:15:01,664
...we're going to kill him,
fuck him...

952
01:15:02,040 --> 01:15:03,541
...and film it.

953
01:15:06,627 --> 01:15:09,004
If that's not enough for you...

954
01:15:09,213 --> 01:15:11,966
...we're going to go after
your family.

955
01:15:14,551 --> 01:15:15,969
I'Il get the film.

956
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:21,141
Good boy.
You're being very cooperative.

957
01:15:21,724 --> 01:15:24,435
Mr. Longdale here will
keep you company.

958
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,395
Why me?

959
01:15:26,812 --> 01:15:29,023
Because I don't Iike you,
Mr. Longdale.

960
01:15:38,406 --> 01:15:39,908
Mr. W...

961
01:15:43,244 --> 01:15:44,495
...hurry back.

962
01:15:48,749 --> 01:15:52,961
Since I met you, there isn't much you've
done that I haven't been party to.

963
01:15:53,170 --> 01:15:56,048
None of this would be happening
if you'd given up.

964
01:15:56,214 --> 01:15:58,675
Or not taken the job
in the first place.

965
01:15:58,925 --> 01:16:01,136
I never expected you to get this far.

966
01:16:01,428 --> 01:16:05,389
I hired you because you're young
and completely out of your Ieague.

967
01:16:05,556 --> 01:16:07,850
But I underestimated your ambition.

968
01:16:08,059 --> 01:16:12,896
You took one Iook at the Christian
compound. It was heady, wasn't it?

969
01:16:12,980 --> 01:16:16,900
You weren't peeking through the gates.
Mrs. Christian welcomed you in.

970
01:16:17,192 --> 01:16:20,487
Do you think people Iike
the Christians hire people Iike us...

971
01:16:20,695 --> 01:16:22,780
...as an invitation
to their dinner parties?

972
01:16:23,072 --> 01:16:27,076
No, we're there to clean up the mess,
to wipe their royal asses.

973
01:16:27,368 --> 01:16:28,953
You were asked to buy a snuff film.

974
01:16:29,161 --> 01:16:32,247
They couldn't find one,
so you paid them to make one.

975
01:16:32,456 --> 01:16:34,374
Isn't that what happened?

976
01:16:34,583 --> 01:16:37,169
She was alive till you paid
to have her murdered?

977
01:16:37,294 --> 01:16:39,129
How much did Christian
pay for your conscience?

978
01:16:39,337 --> 01:16:40,130
A million?

979
01:16:41,005 --> 01:16:42,549
I've been well compensated.

980
01:16:42,715 --> 01:16:44,384
But you, I bought cheap.

981
01:16:45,968 --> 01:16:49,388
Just because Mrs. Christian
praised your discretion...

982
01:16:49,597 --> 01:16:52,808
...you sat on evidence of murder,
dragged your friend, family...

983
01:16:53,016 --> 01:16:55,310
...into some old graveyard...

984
01:16:55,644 --> 01:16:59,356
...to dig up a dead girl with no name
that nobody remembers.

985
01:16:59,689 --> 01:17:00,857
Mary Anne Mathews.

986
01:17:01,066 --> 01:17:03,943
That was her name.
Her mother remembers her.

987
01:17:04,235 --> 01:17:05,570
I'm bored with this.

988
01:17:05,903 --> 01:17:08,072
You know the difference between us?

989
01:17:08,239 --> 01:17:11,283
I will survive this and profit by it,
whereas you...

990
01:17:11,492 --> 01:17:12,534
...you will not.

991
01:17:12,826 --> 01:17:14,286
Now get the film.

992
01:17:19,666 --> 01:17:21,251
Did you watch it with him?

993
01:17:21,459 --> 01:17:22,252
What?

994
01:17:22,502 --> 01:17:24,587
The snuff film.
Did you watch it with him?

995
01:17:24,837 --> 01:17:26,964
This isn't helping your friend.
Get the film.

996
01:17:27,173 --> 01:17:28,257
Did it get him off?

997
01:17:28,799 --> 01:17:30,050
Mr. Christian?

998
01:17:30,342 --> 01:17:33,554
Watching them cut her up Iike that?
Did he jerk off to it?

999
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,847
Did you hold his cock?
Give him the hand job...

1000
01:17:36,098 --> 01:17:38,767
...while Mary Anne Mathews was dying?!

1001
01:17:39,017 --> 01:17:41,686
-What are you doing?
-Trying to understand!

1002
01:17:41,811 --> 01:17:43,980
What did he want
with a snuff film?!

1003
01:17:44,439 --> 01:17:45,314
Why?

1004
01:17:45,565 --> 01:17:47,441
Yes, why? Why?!

1005
01:17:47,608 --> 01:17:49,527
Why did he want a film...

1006
01:17:49,693 --> 01:17:52,112
...of a Iittle girl being butchered?!

1007
01:17:53,363 --> 01:17:54,615
Because he could.

1008
01:17:55,240 --> 01:17:57,075
He did it because he could.

1009
01:17:59,035 --> 01:18:01,204
What reason were you Iooking for?

1010
01:18:05,124 --> 01:18:06,250
Now.

1011
01:18:20,055 --> 01:18:21,264
Here.

1012
01:18:21,973 --> 01:18:23,308
Shoot me.

1013
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,276
Mr. Welles, the film, please.

1014
01:18:35,360 --> 01:18:36,403
Let him go first.

1015
01:18:36,737 --> 01:18:39,114
Do whatever you want to me,
but Iet him go.

1016
01:18:39,239 --> 01:18:41,699
Very welI.
Set him free, Machine.

1017
01:19:16,732 --> 01:19:18,567
-ls that it?
-That's it.

1018
01:19:18,858 --> 01:19:20,026
Bravo.

1019
01:19:21,361 --> 01:19:23,196
You don't want to miss this...

1020
01:19:23,363 --> 01:19:25,114
...Mr. Welles.

1021
01:19:33,956 --> 01:19:35,749
So it ends.

1022
01:19:37,751 --> 01:19:40,128
As if she never existed.

1023
01:19:40,754 --> 01:19:44,007
Don't blame yourself.
You were in way over your head.

1024
01:19:44,716 --> 01:19:46,551
You motherfuckers!

1025
01:19:48,677 --> 01:19:51,013
You smalltime motherfuckers.

1026
01:19:52,681 --> 01:19:54,474
I want to know something.

1027
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:58,645
Why you're still smalltime with a
million dollars to spread around?

1028
01:19:59,271 --> 01:20:00,063
Million?

1029
01:20:00,271 --> 01:20:03,107
Yeah! That's what Christian
gave Longdale!

1030
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:05,485
That's what he gave you, right?

1031
01:20:05,777 --> 01:20:07,069
A million in cash?

1032
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:09,405
You stupid fucking trash!

1033
01:20:09,738 --> 01:20:13,492
What the hell--?
Is he talking dollars here?

1034
01:20:13,867 --> 01:20:15,118
No, he's Iying.

1035
01:20:15,410 --> 01:20:16,870
Did you fuck me?

1036
01:20:18,121 --> 01:20:19,205
Did you fuck me on this?

1037
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:20,582
Of course not, Edward!

1038
01:20:20,832 --> 01:20:22,792
Then what's he talking about?

1039
01:20:22,917 --> 01:20:25,837
He's saying that Longdale fucked us...

1040
01:20:26,045 --> 01:20:28,839
...which is so totally,
completely bizarre.

1041
01:20:29,632 --> 01:20:30,424
Stay back.

1042
01:20:31,050 --> 01:20:31,967
Stay away from me.

1043
01:20:32,843 --> 01:20:34,136
Put the bow down!

1044
01:20:34,344 --> 01:20:36,263
I told you not to trust the prick.

1045
01:20:36,430 --> 01:20:38,974
Mr. Longdale, if there's no honour...

1046
01:20:39,182 --> 01:20:40,850
...among perverts and pornographers...

1047
01:20:41,059 --> 01:20:43,102
...the whole business would fall apart.

1048
01:20:43,353 --> 01:20:46,981
Because there's no records,
no contracts, no Iegal recourse.

1049
01:20:47,273 --> 01:20:48,607
So if someone...

1050
01:20:48,941 --> 01:20:50,192
...cheats us...

1051
01:20:50,317 --> 01:20:51,944
...that person can't be trusted.

1052
01:20:52,277 --> 01:20:55,113
That person could turn us in,
have us killed.

1053
01:20:55,822 --> 01:20:59,367
So we don't have a choice,
do we, Mr. Longdale?

1054
01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:02,620
I want this to be over.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

1055
01:21:02,829 --> 01:21:04,163
Eddie, take your gun out.

1056
01:21:04,706 --> 01:21:05,623
Fuck you.

1057
01:21:05,832 --> 01:21:07,917
Take it out now! And drop it.

1058
01:21:08,084 --> 01:21:09,752
Or I will shoot.

1059
01:21:10,085 --> 01:21:11,837
Don't be stupid, Edward.

1060
01:21:17,134 --> 01:21:18,593
Kick it in my direction.

1061
01:21:22,138 --> 01:21:24,557
Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.

1062
01:21:29,019 --> 01:21:30,354
Action.

1063
01:21:41,573 --> 01:21:43,157
This is wrong.

1064
01:21:43,866 --> 01:21:45,701
Something's wrong.

1065
01:21:45,868 --> 01:21:47,245
God, not Iike this.

1066
01:21:49,163 --> 01:21:51,373
I am supposed to have...

1067
01:21:52,124 --> 01:21:53,917
...something more cinematic.

1068
01:21:54,626 --> 01:21:56,253
Kill them, Machine.

1069
01:21:57,587 --> 01:21:59,005
Kill them alI.

1070
01:22:06,304 --> 01:22:07,346
Machine!

1071
01:22:47,008 --> 01:22:47,758
Stop, Eddie!

1072
01:22:49,385 --> 01:22:52,096
I swear to Christ,
I'Il shoot you in the back!

1073
01:22:53,722 --> 01:22:54,806
Take off the mask.

1074
01:22:56,850 --> 01:22:58,351
Take off the fucking mask!

1075
01:22:58,727 --> 01:23:00,603
He's only got one bullet!

1076
01:24:38,693 --> 01:24:40,070
Amy, Iisten carefully.

1077
01:24:40,278 --> 01:24:42,572
-Tom, where are you?
-Amy, just listen.

1078
01:24:42,739 --> 01:24:45,032
Take Cindy.
Get out of the house now.

1079
01:24:45,241 --> 01:24:47,410
Go to where we spent
Fourth of July weekend.

1080
01:24:47,576 --> 01:24:50,412
-Why? What's wrong?
-Amy, please. l can't.

1081
01:24:50,746 --> 01:24:52,664
L 'll be there in three hours.

1082
01:24:53,040 --> 01:24:54,750
I'm on my way! Go now!

1083
01:24:55,125 --> 01:24:56,918
Tom, you're scaring me.

1084
01:24:57,127 --> 01:24:58,837
Please, Amy, just do it!

1085
01:24:59,796 --> 01:25:01,798
Okay, bye. I'm going.

1086
01:25:09,263 --> 01:25:11,056
Mrs. Christian, it's Tom Welles.

1087
01:25:11,307 --> 01:25:12,599
Longdale is dead.

1088
01:25:12,808 --> 01:25:14,643
He was killed by the men
who made the film.

1089
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:17,938
He hired them for your husband.
Kept most of the million.

1090
01:25:18,230 --> 01:25:19,814
The film is real!

1091
01:25:20,065 --> 01:25:21,274
They killed that girI!

1092
01:25:23,234 --> 01:25:24,569
Mrs. Christian?

1093
01:25:24,736 --> 01:25:27,363
I'm still here, Mr. Welles.

1094
01:25:27,571 --> 01:25:28,989
I'm sorry.
I know this must be--

1095
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,533
Are you in danger?

1096
01:25:30,741 --> 01:25:33,535
We'Il go to the police.
I'Il tell you everything tonight.

1097
01:25:33,785 --> 01:25:35,329
We'Il call the police
in the morning.

1098
01:25:35,829 --> 01:25:36,788
All right.

1099
01:25:37,122 --> 01:25:38,081
Eight o'clock?

1100
01:25:38,248 --> 01:25:40,041
Yes, eight o'clock is fine.

1101
01:25:40,208 --> 01:25:41,501
Do you know...

1102
01:25:41,709 --> 01:25:45,630
...what the poor girI's name was?

1103
01:25:47,757 --> 01:25:49,675
Mary Anne Mathews.

1104
01:25:53,262 --> 01:25:54,179
Thank you.

1105
01:25:54,555 --> 01:25:56,556
Mr. Welles, goodbye.

1106
01:26:52,024 --> 01:26:53,734
Are you okay?

1107
01:26:55,569 --> 01:26:56,737
Are you?

1108
01:26:57,654 --> 01:26:59,864
Why haven't you called me?

1109
01:27:02,492 --> 01:27:05,703
Why did you disappear
off the face of the Earth?

1110
01:27:06,787 --> 01:27:08,247
You're bleeding.

1111
01:27:08,873 --> 01:27:10,374
Are those handcuffs?

1112
01:27:10,624 --> 01:27:12,376
Were you Iocked up?

1113
01:27:13,252 --> 01:27:15,837
Kept from a phone? What happened?

1114
01:27:16,046 --> 01:27:16,838
Start talking, Tom.

1115
01:27:17,130 --> 01:27:21,217
Because if you want to stay married,
you can't treat me this way!

1116
01:27:21,885 --> 01:27:23,094
You're right.

1117
01:27:23,303 --> 01:27:25,221
Everything you say is right.

1118
01:27:27,390 --> 01:27:29,767
That won't do it.
That's not enough, Tom.

1119
01:27:30,059 --> 01:27:31,185
Not anymore.

1120
01:27:32,311 --> 01:27:34,771
I'm not going to Iet
anything happen to us.

1121
01:27:35,063 --> 01:27:37,065
Look where we are!

1122
01:27:37,607 --> 01:27:40,110
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself! Look!

1123
01:27:41,069 --> 01:27:42,403
You son of a bitch.

1124
01:27:42,695 --> 01:27:46,199
You don't even have any idea
what you're putting me through.

1125
01:27:48,159 --> 01:27:51,245
What was I supposed to think
happened to you?

1126
01:27:56,625 --> 01:27:58,793
We're going to stay here a few days.

1127
01:27:59,002 --> 01:28:00,337
It's just a few days.

1128
01:28:00,587 --> 01:28:01,796
I'm sorry.

1129
01:28:02,046 --> 01:28:03,881
There's no other way around this.

1130
01:28:04,090 --> 01:28:05,633
I swear, I swear...

1131
01:28:07,802 --> 01:28:10,763
...l won't Iet anything happen to us.
I'Il take care of this.

1132
01:28:11,013 --> 01:28:12,598
I swear it.

1133
01:28:13,432 --> 01:28:14,975
I swear it.

1134
01:28:16,810 --> 01:28:18,770
Now I have to go back out.

1135
01:28:19,562 --> 01:28:20,772
Where?

1136
01:28:23,941 --> 01:28:26,068
I have to see Mrs. Christian.

1137
01:28:27,028 --> 01:28:28,863
She's the only witness.

1138
01:28:29,947 --> 01:28:31,115
To what?

1139
01:28:33,367 --> 01:28:35,202
We're going to be okay.

1140
01:28:38,038 --> 01:28:39,789
We're going to be okay.

1141
01:28:53,302 --> 01:28:55,554
Tom Welles.
Mrs. Christian's expecting me.

1142
01:28:55,762 --> 01:28:57,556
Yes, she Ieft instructions.

1143
01:28:58,348 --> 01:29:00,642
I have to see her now.
It's extremely urgent.

1144
01:29:01,351 --> 01:29:05,021
Mrs. Christian chose to take
her own Iife this afternoon, Mr. Welles.

1145
01:29:10,276 --> 01:29:11,527
But I just....

1146
01:29:12,194 --> 01:29:13,737
No, no, I just....

1147
01:29:15,113 --> 01:29:16,531
I just spoke to her.

1148
01:29:16,782 --> 01:29:19,868
Her instructions were
that this first envelope...

1149
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:22,036
...is for Mary's family.

1150
01:29:22,412 --> 01:29:25,081
She wrote that you'd understand
what that meant.

1151
01:29:25,748 --> 01:29:27,917
And the second envelope is for you.

1152
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:34,298
Services will be held next week,
if you'd Iike to attend.

1153
01:29:35,340 --> 01:29:36,883
I am sorry, sir.

1154
01:29:37,592 --> 01:29:38,718
Good night, sir.

1155
01:30:12,958 --> 01:30:14,459
What are you doing?

1156
01:30:16,962 --> 01:30:18,672
I have to go back.

1157
01:30:29,515 --> 01:30:31,141
Whatever it is...

1158
01:30:31,558 --> 01:30:33,018
...wherever you were...

1159
01:30:33,268 --> 01:30:35,520
...just forget about it.

1160
01:30:35,729 --> 01:30:37,439
You stay here.

1161
01:30:37,939 --> 01:30:39,399
I can't.

1162
01:30:42,360 --> 01:30:45,363
And risk us?
Risk your family? Why?

1163
01:30:46,822 --> 01:30:49,283
There's no one Ieft
to finish this but me.

1164
01:30:50,201 --> 01:30:52,286
I'Il call you
when it's safe to go home.

1165
01:30:54,913 --> 01:30:57,290
We may not be there
when you get back.

1166
01:31:11,053 --> 01:31:14,181
Cindy's education, and a Iot more.

1167
01:31:23,606 --> 01:31:25,108
I Iove you.

1168
01:32:14,861 --> 01:32:16,947
Put your hands on your head.
Down on your knees.

1169
01:32:18,990 --> 01:32:20,909
You think I'm fucking around?

1170
01:32:23,870 --> 01:32:24,912
Hurts, doesn't it?

1171
01:32:25,079 --> 01:32:26,455
What the fuck do you want?

1172
01:32:26,664 --> 01:32:27,790
Who's Machine?

1173
01:32:27,999 --> 01:32:29,041
Where does he Iive?

1174
01:32:29,875 --> 01:32:30,960
I don't know.

1175
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:32,586
I want his name.

1176
01:32:32,878 --> 01:32:35,047
I don't know his fucking name.

1177
01:32:37,841 --> 01:32:40,051
I will never get tired of hurting you.

1178
01:32:40,176 --> 01:32:44,138
I don't know his name. He shows up
in his mask, he Ieaves in his mask.

1179
01:32:44,389 --> 01:32:46,098
He's from New York somewhere.

1180
01:32:51,520 --> 01:32:53,147
Get in the car.

1181
01:32:54,731 --> 01:32:55,440
Why?

1182
01:32:56,191 --> 01:32:58,360
You're going to show me
where he killed her.

1183
01:32:59,277 --> 01:33:00,320
Fuck you!

1184
01:33:02,572 --> 01:33:04,323
All right, you fuck.

1185
01:33:17,878 --> 01:33:20,213
What did you do before
you brought her here?

1186
01:33:21,172 --> 01:33:23,508
Tell her how beautiful she was...

1187
01:33:24,717 --> 01:33:26,886
...how you'd make her a big star?

1188
01:33:31,890 --> 01:33:33,392
Talk her up?

1189
01:33:37,562 --> 01:33:39,773
What the fuck do you want from me?

1190
01:33:43,609 --> 01:33:45,111
I want to know.

1191
01:33:48,322 --> 01:33:49,740
You want to know?

1192
01:33:53,327 --> 01:33:56,288
She was nothing.
A Iittle pussy off the street.

1193
01:33:56,455 --> 01:33:59,416
Girl Iike that disappears,
nobody gives a shit.

1194
01:34:00,625 --> 01:34:02,794
Yeah, I talked her up.

1195
01:34:03,127 --> 01:34:06,255
Told her what she wanted to hear,
that she'd be a star...

1196
01:34:06,422 --> 01:34:09,633
...she'd make a Iot of money,
and all the rest of the bullshit.

1197
01:34:09,884 --> 01:34:13,846
When I was finished, she was all
excited about her big screen test.

1198
01:34:15,597 --> 01:34:17,099
I called up Dino...

1199
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:20,518
...he and Machine flew out here.
We had a Iittle party.

1200
01:34:22,061 --> 01:34:23,896
What else you want to know?

1201
01:34:24,647 --> 01:34:26,357
You saw the film, right?

1202
01:34:27,066 --> 01:34:28,484
You know the ending.

1203
01:34:30,611 --> 01:34:32,863
Nobody else saw you bring her in?

1204
01:34:34,990 --> 01:34:37,868
Who's going to see?
Place is a fucking shithole.

1205
01:34:41,246 --> 01:34:43,122
I brought her in and she...

1206
01:34:44,916 --> 01:34:47,168
...saw Machine
standing in the corner.

1207
01:34:48,627 --> 01:34:50,254
She started crying...

1208
01:34:52,131 --> 01:34:54,216
...making these Iittle noises.

1209
01:34:56,218 --> 01:34:59,012
So I slapped her around a bit
just to shut her up.

1210
01:34:59,346 --> 01:35:00,513
Dino...

1211
01:35:00,764 --> 01:35:02,682
...fed her a bunch of pills.

1212
01:35:04,142 --> 01:35:06,686
Machine put down the plastic over here.

1213
01:35:09,814 --> 01:35:11,690
Just started cutting her up.

1214
01:35:15,444 --> 01:35:17,612
That's it. She's dead.

1215
01:35:17,821 --> 01:35:20,949
She's been dead a Iong time.
Nobody gives a shit but you.

1216
01:35:34,920 --> 01:35:36,630
You wanted to know.

1217
01:35:36,922 --> 01:35:38,548
Now you know.

1218
01:35:40,467 --> 01:35:41,801
You were in here.

1219
01:35:41,968 --> 01:35:45,638
You watched Mary Anne
bleed to death from here.

1220
01:35:46,931 --> 01:35:48,015
Why?

1221
01:35:49,767 --> 01:35:51,518
Why did you watch?

1222
01:35:52,353 --> 01:35:53,645
I felt Iike it.

1223
01:35:55,814 --> 01:35:57,482
I never saw nobody get done.

1224
01:35:58,650 --> 01:35:59,442
Why?

1225
01:36:00,735 --> 01:36:02,904
Did you get hard? Did you come?

1226
01:36:03,112 --> 01:36:05,490
No. It made me sick.

1227
01:36:05,740 --> 01:36:07,283
But what do I give a shit...

1228
01:36:07,491 --> 01:36:11,370
...if some rich fucking wacko wants
to beat off to something Iike that?

1229
01:36:11,745 --> 01:36:12,996
Stay down!

1230
01:36:15,332 --> 01:36:17,292
It was something I did for money.

1231
01:36:19,753 --> 01:36:21,754
I needed the fucking money.

1232
01:36:22,297 --> 01:36:23,798
Where is she?

1233
01:36:23,965 --> 01:36:25,383
Where did you put her body?

1234
01:36:25,842 --> 01:36:27,760
I buried it in the woods.

1235
01:36:28,886 --> 01:36:29,803
You won't find it.

1236
01:36:29,970 --> 01:36:32,139
And even if you do,
what do you got?

1237
01:36:32,431 --> 01:36:34,558
You got a girI's skeleton, that's it.

1238
01:36:34,725 --> 01:36:36,727
Without the film, you got nothing.

1239
01:36:37,561 --> 01:36:39,521
All you can do is cut me Ioose.

1240
01:36:39,646 --> 01:36:42,023
Without the film,
you got nothing--

1241
01:36:42,232 --> 01:36:43,775
What the fuck are you doing?

1242
01:36:43,983 --> 01:36:45,818
-Hands behind your back.
-Fuck you!

1243
01:36:46,611 --> 01:36:49,029
Put your hands behind your back!

1244
01:36:49,238 --> 01:36:50,573
All right.

1245
01:36:55,619 --> 01:36:57,746
What the fuck are you doing?

1246
01:37:03,167 --> 01:37:04,961
I'm going to kill you.

1247
01:37:06,379 --> 01:37:08,214
I'm going to kill you.

1248
01:37:09,840 --> 01:37:13,093
And I'm going to Ieave you here
just Iike you Ieft her.

1249
01:37:14,928 --> 01:37:16,680
You're not going to kill me.

1250
01:37:17,472 --> 01:37:18,557
You don't have it in you.

1251
01:37:20,225 --> 01:37:22,560
You going to shoot me
with your own gun?

1252
01:37:22,810 --> 01:37:24,103
Registered in your name?

1253
01:37:26,397 --> 01:37:28,899
You thought this through,
didn't you, genius?

1254
01:37:29,233 --> 01:37:31,360
You'Il have to dig
the bullets out of my head.

1255
01:37:31,694 --> 01:37:33,320
That'Il be nice.

1256
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,948
Or you could dig a hole.

1257
01:37:37,741 --> 01:37:41,035
Dig it with your own hands and
bury me next to your girlfriend.

1258
01:37:41,703 --> 01:37:42,912
Go ahead.

1259
01:37:43,538 --> 01:37:44,580
Pull the fucking trigger.

1260
01:37:45,081 --> 01:37:45,915
Go ahead.

1261
01:37:46,040 --> 01:37:48,125
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, do it.

1262
01:37:48,417 --> 01:37:49,793
You faggot!

1263
01:37:51,920 --> 01:37:53,797
What do you want me to do?
Start crying?

1264
01:37:54,006 --> 01:37:56,425
Like a baby?
" I'm so sorry I killed the girI."

1265
01:37:56,675 --> 01:37:58,343
Fuck you! And fuck her!

1266
01:37:58,593 --> 01:38:02,263
Go ahead, put me out of my misery.
Pull the fucking trigger.

1267
01:38:03,431 --> 01:38:04,849
Pull the fucking trigger.

1268
01:38:05,349 --> 01:38:06,350
Do it!

1269
01:38:07,101 --> 01:38:08,144
Do it!

1270
01:38:15,150 --> 01:38:16,860
You can't do it.

1271
01:38:17,736 --> 01:38:19,654
You Iittle pansy bitch!

1272
01:38:19,863 --> 01:38:20,989
Look at you.

1273
01:38:21,239 --> 01:38:23,074
Big fucking hero man.

1274
01:38:23,241 --> 01:38:24,826
You can't fucking do it.

1275
01:38:26,661 --> 01:38:27,953
Look at him.

1276
01:38:28,788 --> 01:38:30,289
Big fucking hero.

1277
01:38:31,332 --> 01:38:33,333
Go on home to your wifey!

1278
01:38:34,418 --> 01:38:36,003
You pussy!

1279
01:38:36,711 --> 01:38:38,588
You big fucking pussy!

1280
01:38:40,340 --> 01:38:42,800
What are you going to do now, faggot?

1281
01:38:45,011 --> 01:38:47,054
You can't go to the cops!

1282
01:38:48,347 --> 01:38:52,684
Send me your wife and daughter.
We'Il make a film, you faggot!

1283
01:38:55,979 --> 01:38:57,105
Shit!

1284
01:38:57,647 --> 01:38:59,107
You punk-ass!

1285
01:39:44,148 --> 01:39:45,900
Mrs. Mathews?

1286
01:39:46,192 --> 01:39:47,902
It's Thomas.

1287
01:39:48,194 --> 01:39:49,778
Thomas Hart.

1288
01:39:50,029 --> 01:39:53,323
I was there a few weeks ago
asking about your daughter.

1289
01:39:53,782 --> 01:39:55,992
Yeah, you found her diary.

1290
01:39:56,201 --> 01:39:57,661
Thank you.

1291
01:39:58,245 --> 01:40:00,413
She did Ieave a note...

1292
01:40:00,747 --> 01:40:04,959
...and her stupid boyfriend
dumped her in California...

1293
01:40:05,209 --> 01:40:06,544
...so I told the FBI.

1294
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:09,171
Remember when...

1295
01:40:09,839 --> 01:40:12,549
...l asked you if you'd want to know...

1296
01:40:13,634 --> 01:40:14,760
...the truth...

1297
01:40:15,761 --> 01:40:17,304
...no matter what?

1298
01:40:18,096 --> 01:40:21,766
Some men, they took her and
they killed her and they buried her.

1299
01:40:23,017 --> 01:40:24,560
L 'm sorry.

1300
01:40:24,811 --> 01:40:25,686
L 'm sorry.

1301
01:40:26,312 --> 01:40:28,355
I want to punish them for what they did.

1302
01:40:28,814 --> 01:40:30,733
Why are you saying this?

1303
01:40:30,899 --> 01:40:32,818
I can hurt them.

1304
01:40:33,068 --> 01:40:36,238
Give me your permission
to hurt them, please.

1305
01:40:37,280 --> 01:40:39,115
Tell me how much she meant to you.

1306
01:40:40,158 --> 01:40:42,285
Just tell me that you loved her.

1307
01:40:42,577 --> 01:40:45,455
-Please tell me that you loved her.
-l Iove her.

1308
01:40:45,746 --> 01:40:47,623
I Iove her so much.

1309
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:52,169
I Iove her so much.

1310
01:40:58,883 --> 01:41:00,135
Who's that?

1311
01:41:05,098 --> 01:41:07,391
Die, you motherfucker, die!

1312
01:42:39,142 --> 01:42:40,060
New York Hospital.

1313
01:42:40,268 --> 01:42:42,145
Connect me to the duty nurse.

1314
01:42:42,353 --> 01:42:43,229
Emergency.

1315
01:42:43,521 --> 01:42:45,815
L t's Lt. Anderson of the 13th precinct.

1316
01:42:46,107 --> 01:42:49,068
Have you admitted an adult male
with an abdominal wound...

1317
01:42:49,235 --> 01:42:51,695
... in the last 48 hours?
A stabbing incident.

1318
01:42:51,987 --> 01:42:53,280
Abdominal wound?

1319
01:42:53,572 --> 01:42:54,531
No, not one.

1320
01:42:54,865 --> 01:42:55,949
Thank you.

1321
01:42:56,116 --> 01:42:59,661
L 'm looking for a stabbing victim.
Male. Maybe six feet.

1322
01:42:59,828 --> 01:43:01,788
Filed a bogus report.

1323
01:43:02,288 --> 01:43:04,791
We had a guy in on Monday, l think.

1324
01:43:05,041 --> 01:43:07,209
L t would've been
yesterday or the day before.

1325
01:43:07,418 --> 01:43:08,210
Sorry.

1326
01:43:08,961 --> 01:43:11,672
-Queens County Emergency.
-Hi, Lt. Anderson.

1327
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:13,549
We had a stabbing incident...

1328
01:43:13,757 --> 01:43:15,926
...and supposed victim gave us
a false name.

1329
01:43:16,218 --> 01:43:17,969
A male with an abdominal wound.

1330
01:43:18,220 --> 01:43:20,180
Hold on. Let me check my records.

1331
01:43:20,346 --> 01:43:23,057
There was a patient treated yesterday.

1332
01:43:23,266 --> 01:43:25,184
Star tattoo on his right hand?

1333
01:43:25,309 --> 01:43:26,936
Yes. George Anthony Higgins.

1334
01:43:27,186 --> 01:43:31,440
L nsurance policy is under his
mother's name, Doris Veronica Higgins.

1335
01:43:31,607 --> 01:43:33,859
That's him.
Can you give me an address?

1336
01:43:34,067 --> 01:43:37,279
L t's under her address. Douglaston.
Need a street?

1337
01:44:11,894 --> 01:44:15,188
I really wish you'd go
to church with me tonight.

1338
01:44:20,026 --> 01:44:21,694
I Iove you, son.

1339
01:44:25,573 --> 01:44:27,950
I'Il be home by 10. Bye-bye.

1340
01:49:09,083 --> 01:49:11,043
You know the best part
of killing someone?

1341
01:49:11,669 --> 01:49:13,629
The Iook on their face.

1342
01:49:13,837 --> 01:49:15,213
It's that Iook...

1343
01:49:15,339 --> 01:49:16,965
...not when they're threatened...

1344
01:49:17,215 --> 01:49:18,758
...not when you hurt them...

1345
01:49:19,009 --> 01:49:21,553
...not even when they see the knife.

1346
01:49:22,011 --> 01:49:24,013
It's when they feel the knife go in.

1347
01:49:24,138 --> 01:49:25,139
That's it.

1348
01:49:25,723 --> 01:49:27,350
It's surprise.

1349
01:49:27,600 --> 01:49:29,560
They can't believe
it's really happening.

1350
01:49:29,810 --> 01:49:30,853
She had that Iook.

1351
01:49:31,478 --> 01:49:34,690
The girl, when she knew
it wasn't just porno.

1352
01:49:34,856 --> 01:49:36,817
You feel how hard I am?

1353
01:49:47,243 --> 01:49:48,619
Take off the mask.

1354
01:50:04,092 --> 01:50:06,260
What did you expect, a monster?

1355
01:50:14,059 --> 01:50:15,894
My name's George.

1356
01:50:16,144 --> 01:50:17,979
You probably knew that already.

1357
01:50:20,523 --> 01:50:22,692
Can't get your mind around it, huh?

1358
01:50:22,817 --> 01:50:24,318
I don't have any answers.

1359
01:50:24,527 --> 01:50:27,571
Nothing I can say will
make you sleep easier at night.

1360
01:50:27,697 --> 01:50:30,491
I wasn't beaten. I wasn't molested.

1361
01:50:30,699 --> 01:50:32,493
Mommy didn't abuse me.

1362
01:50:34,328 --> 01:50:35,829
Daddy never raped me.

1363
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:38,415
I'm only what I am.

1364
01:50:38,707 --> 01:50:40,333
That's all there is to it!

1365
01:50:52,302 --> 01:50:53,846
There's no mystery.

1366
01:50:53,971 --> 01:50:57,474
Things I do, I do them because
l Iike them.

1367
01:50:58,808 --> 01:51:00,477
Because I want to.

1368
01:51:46,602 --> 01:51:48,646
You've been stabbed?
How many times?

1369
01:51:48,854 --> 01:51:51,231
Sir, can you tell me your name?

1370
01:52:40,485 --> 01:52:41,736
Is that you?

1371
01:52:45,281 --> 01:52:46,365
My God!

1372
01:53:03,464 --> 01:53:04,924
Save me.

1373
01:53:09,803 --> 01:53:11,597
Save me.

1374
01:54:24,455 --> 01:54:25,873
Dear Mr. Welles.:

1375
01:54:26,082 --> 01:54:27,541
Thank you for writing...

1376
01:54:27,750 --> 01:54:29,710
...and telling me your real name...

1377
01:54:29,919 --> 01:54:32,838
... who you really are
and what really happened.

1378
01:54:33,005 --> 01:54:35,299
L 'm glad those men are dead.

1379
01:54:35,590 --> 01:54:38,551
But nothing will ever
fill the hole in my heart.

1380
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:41,638
L will try to use the money
you sent for some good...

1381
01:54:41,804 --> 01:54:44,098
...after l get some help for myself.

1382
01:54:44,348 --> 01:54:46,684
l hated you
for telling me the truth...

1383
01:54:46,809 --> 01:54:50,062
...but now l realize you and l
are the only people...

1384
01:54:50,312 --> 01:54:52,856
... that ever really
cared about Mary Anne.

1385
01:54:53,148 --> 01:54:54,608
Yours truly...

1386
01:54:54,942 --> 01:54:56,276
...Janet Mathews.
