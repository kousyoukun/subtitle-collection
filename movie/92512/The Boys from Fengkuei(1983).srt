1
00:00:11,444 --> 00:00:17,815
The Boys from Fengkuei

2
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:23,206
Minus four points.

3
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,941
For which one?

4
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:27,948
Minus four points for whom?

5
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,214
The fourth one.

6
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:30,686
Minus four points.

7
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:05,610
Who is it?

8
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:08,081
I am wet all over.

9
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,621
Who is it? Not the Piggy.

10
00:03:16,062 --> 00:03:17,757
What?

11
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:15,449
Heads starts from the right.

12
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:21,984
Tails starts from here.

13
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,230
What's the bid?

14
00:04:26,499 --> 00:04:29,730
This is Hsiao-ling's-- $ 110.

15
00:04:29,869 --> 00:04:32,337
That'll never get it.

16
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,163
Keep opening them.

17
00:04:34,307 --> 00:04:37,367
This is Ah-lien's--NT $ 48.

18
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,775
That'll never get it.

19
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,475
How can such bids ever win ?

20
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:52,687
This is for interest.

21
00:04:56,329 --> 00:04:58,559
Like grandma.

22
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:04,762
Hsiu-chuan's-- NT$ 250

23
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:07,099
With that bid, she'll get it.

24
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,070
NT$ 250

25
00:05:08,207 --> 00:05:10,334
You planning to run off with it?

26
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:15,041
You going away again, Ching-tzu?

27
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:17,308
No.

28
00:05:28,227 --> 00:05:29,387
Can't you get out of the sun?

29
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:32,123
Don't you know to move a little?

30
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,677
Come on! Hurry up.

31
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,553
Close the door, Potato.

32
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:34,216
Hey! What are you doing?

33
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,817
What are you doing?

34
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,524
If you can't buy a ticket,

35
00:06:38,664 --> 00:06:41,394
get out.

36
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,255
Damn!

37
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,984
Black and white?

38
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,390
Why aren't there any porno shorts?

39
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,444
You took it, hand over the money.

40
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:11,174
I didn't take yours.

41
00:09:11,317 --> 00:09:12,249
I took from No.4

42
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:13,784
You picked it up from No.4

43
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,477
I didn't.

44
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,814
Yes, you did--from No.4

45
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:17,286
I picked up from No.4

46
00:09:17,423 --> 00:09:19,653
From No.4

47
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:20,349
No!

48
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:21,858
Yes

49
00:09:21,994 --> 00:09:23,393
I picked up 6 from No.4.

50
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,723
You picked it up on me.

51
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:25,660
I didn't do it!

52
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:26,389
You did!

53
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,500
I didn't! You did!

54
00:09:38,477 --> 00:09:39,102
Give me the money.

55
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:39,904
It wasn't me.

56
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,411
Give me the money.

57
00:09:41,547 --> 00:09:44,038
I told you, it wasn't me.

58
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,727
Wait......Gambling again!

59
00:09:57,863 --> 00:09:58,329
Over there.

60
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,453
Where?

61
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:02,057
That one

62
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:14,835
It's this one.

63
00:10:16,215 --> 00:10:17,113
This one?

64
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:20,285
Why'd you cheat my nephew?

65
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,098
What happened? Somebody beat you?

66
00:11:40,232 --> 00:11:43,326
No--got hit by an oxcart.

67
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:59,577
Feed the gruel to your father,
Ching-tzu.

68
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:33,413
Don't want to do it, eh?

69
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:35,577
Run around outside all day long.

70
00:12:35,721 --> 00:12:37,552
And played poker-face
once you come back.

71
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:40,625
And you can't do anything at home.

72
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,729
All you know is arguing
and fighting.

73
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:50,233
And this is the way you act at home!

74
00:13:00,546 --> 00:13:01,478
I didn't lie.

75
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:03,104
Little Tsai told me.

76
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:05,581
Everybody at school knows.

77
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,277
He said an oxcart hit him.

78
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,320
Nonsense! An oxcart goes too slow

79
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:11,889
It is impossible.

80
00:13:12,024 --> 00:13:14,458
Your brother punished Wang Ta-ming.

81
00:13:14,593 --> 00:13:16,618
His brother has a lot of friends.

82
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:18,457
And even the teachers daren't
touch him.

83
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,498
but your brother did.
So he was beat.

84
00:13:30,943 --> 00:13:31,807
Which one?

85
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:33,809
Those two.

86
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:56,226
Where are you going?

87
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,852
I didn't do it.

88
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,794
Ah-jung, where are they from?

89
00:15:39,405 --> 00:15:40,531
I don't know

90
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:42,334
the dock I thank

91
00:15:42,474 --> 00:15:44,669
Be respectful, Big Head.

92
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,275
Poor Ah-yu.

93
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,179
they broke two of his ribs

94
00:15:52,318 --> 00:15:54,786
Seven or eight against just him.

95
00:15:58,757 --> 00:16:01,055
What were you
and Ah-yu doing that day?

96
00:16:01,193 --> 00:16:02,455
Nothing!

97
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,892
Ah-yu told about my brother's fight.

98
00:16:05,030 --> 00:16:06,190
A bunch of them came in two cars

99
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,890
Seven or eight men
came out the cars suddenly.

100
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,364
All I could do was run.

101
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,696
But Yu is beaten.

102
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,737
I took Kuo Tzu back to look

103
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:15,134
They all gone

104
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:17,299
Ah-Yu,too

105
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:22,605
The cops were just at my house, too.

106
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,541
It is lucky I ran out first.

107
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:32,582
My uncle has an empty house.

108
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:33,919
It has been empty for over a year.

109
00:16:34,059 --> 00:16:35,788
They all went to Taiwan.

110
00:16:35,928 --> 00:16:37,987
Would you like to go?

111
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,152
Is this livable?

112
00:17:41,293 --> 00:17:42,453
It's like a haunted house.

113
00:17:43,996 --> 00:17:44,963
Any electricity?

114
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:46,689
Yes.

115
00:17:46,832 --> 00:17:48,732
My father comes once a month.

116
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,927
Really run-down.

117
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,506
Look!

118
00:19:46,885 --> 00:19:50,377
Kuo-tzu, come out here.

119
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:54,319
Look.

120
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,624
Oh, that one--that's my cousin.

121
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:57,490
Your cousin?

122
00:19:57,629 --> 00:19:58,561
Yes! Lin Mei-chuan.

123
00:19:58,697 --> 00:19:59,254
Really?

124
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,456
Really!

125
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:04,660
Lin Mei-chuan!

126
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:06,100
Mei-chuan.

127
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,842
Mei-chuan.

128
00:20:15,347 --> 00:20:16,507
Mei-chuan.

129
00:20:18,016 --> 00:20:19,540
I'm your cousin's friend.

130
00:20:19,685 --> 00:20:21,414
Me too! Me too!

131
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:22,417
My cousin?

132
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:24,317
That's right. Kuo-tzu.

133
00:20:24,456 --> 00:20:24,979
That one.

134
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:26,954
It's him.

135
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,653
I don't know him.

136
00:20:30,796 --> 00:20:34,755
Kuo-tzu! come here!

137
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,629
Hurry up.

138
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:39,264
She said she doesn't know you.

139
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,462
I'm Kuo Wen-Hsiung,

140
00:20:40,606 --> 00:20:42,369
from Fengkuei.

141
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,566
My father's Kuo Ching-fu.

142
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:47,235
Aren't you Ah-yu's daughter,
Mei-chuan.

143
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:48,812
No,

144
00:20:48,947 --> 00:20:50,744
I'm Yang Chin-hua.

145
00:20:50,882 --> 00:20:52,907
Yang Chin -hua.

146
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:55,576
Hey, Ah-ching,
let's go to Kaohsiung?

147
00:21:57,316 --> 00:22:00,251
I heard that Rong's sister
is doing well there.

148
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:01,545
Maybe

149
00:22:01,687 --> 00:22:04,383
Maybe she can find us a job.

150
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:06,423
Aren't you due to join the army?

151
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:07,786
What the hell.

152
00:22:07,926 --> 00:22:10,724
I can't just hang around here.

153
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,665
Hsiao-hu.

154
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:54,333
Aren't you from Fengkuei?

155
00:22:54,473 --> 00:22:55,838
I came here for a change?

156
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:08,016
Ah-ching!
That's Wang Ta-ming's brother.

157
00:23:31,476 --> 00:23:33,671
You're Wang Ta-ming's brother?

158
00:23:57,869 --> 00:23:58,893
Hold the head higher.

159
00:23:59,037 --> 00:24:00,595
Got to pick the feathers
from the neck.

160
00:24:00,739 --> 00:24:01,933
How can I cut it this way?

161
00:24:02,073 --> 00:24:02,937
Hold the head up higher.

162
00:24:03,074 --> 00:24:04,871
Higher.

163
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,305
Can't you do it ?

164
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:08,708
Go ahead, cut it.

165
00:24:08,847 --> 00:24:11,611
You're too slow! Hurry it up.

166
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:16,180
Cut it, and let the blood drip.

167
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:17,811
Bring Potato more life.

168
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:19,082
Cut it deeper! Deeper!

169
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:20,452
Let the blood drip out.

170
00:24:20,592 --> 00:24:21,923
Drip! Drip!

171
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,358
Where's the blood.

172
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:25,292
Being a chicken is no good.

173
00:24:26,498 --> 00:24:27,294
Why isn't there blood?

174
00:24:27,499 --> 00:24:28,295
You cut it wrong.

175
00:24:30,202 --> 00:24:30,964
Cut it again.

176
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:33,536
Give it another slice.

177
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:37,608
How can I do it this way? Higher!

178
00:24:37,742 --> 00:24:39,539
Hold the head higher.

179
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,088
Put the head behind its wings.

180
00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,558
Throw it on the ground to die.

181
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,794
It doesn't seem to be very dead

182
00:25:03,935 --> 00:25:05,596
It crapped.

183
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,329
Don't let it get away.

184
00:25:07,472 --> 00:25:09,736
Stop it.

185
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:40,160
Give it another swipe.

186
00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,234
It's salty.

187
00:25:43,341 --> 00:25:46,367
Drink a toast to your cousin,
Kuo-tzu.

188
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,741
Just a minute. What're you doing?

189
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:50,905
What're you doing? Drinking.

190
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,175
I didn't bother you.

191
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:53,909
Hey! A fly!

192
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:54,643
Why did you hit her?

193
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:55,718
You're a bother.

194
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,556
Are you upset because I touched her?
I just hit her a little.

195
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,690
You treat your girlfriend better than your friends.

196
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:59,588
Ah-ching, let's play the hand game.

197
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:01,919
Why'd you do that?

198
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:03,618
He's always that way.

199
00:26:06,932 --> 00:26:10,026
Cheers, Chin-hua.

200
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:11,328
I don't drink.

201
00:26:11,469 --> 00:26:12,936
You drank with him.

202
00:26:13,071 --> 00:26:13,765
Why not with me?

203
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,667
I'll drink for her.

204
00:26:14,806 --> 00:26:16,171
Don't be that way!.

205
00:26:16,308 --> 00:26:18,037
Bottoms up.

206
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:19,074
I drink for her.

207
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,643
He'll drink for me, okay?.

208
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:24,582
Okay, bottoms up.

209
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:28,246
You can't be this way.

210
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:29,182
That the way I am.

211
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:30,481
I'll drain it.

212
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,223
You didn't buy my soda.

213
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,294
Sorry.

214
00:26:45,003 --> 00:26:46,595
Stop that!

215
00:26:50,008 --> 00:26:52,943
Take it easy.

216
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:07,390
Put a thumbprint below
your signature.

217
00:27:10,195 --> 00:27:11,355
You too.

218
00:27:17,235 --> 00:27:18,702
You.

219
00:27:34,753 --> 00:27:38,189
Fighting around at your age!

220
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:41,258
Fight,
and your brother bails you out.

221
00:27:41,393 --> 00:27:43,156
Your brother had to bail you out.

222
00:27:43,294 --> 00:27:45,319
And you have to pay
medical expenses.

223
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:47,260
Quiet, it's not your business.

224
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,061
I wish they'd lock you up

225
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,692
The sacrificial paper's
all burned, Mom

226
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:55,670
Okay, you can clean it up.

227
00:28:11,623 --> 00:28:15,389
You just had no upbringing.

228
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:18,928
You aren't a child any more.

229
00:28:19,064 --> 00:28:20,895
You shouldn't give Mom
so much trouble.

230
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:23,057
Why don't you be quiet.

231
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,429
You called me to shut up?

232
00:28:24,569 --> 00:28:26,002
You were fighting with hoodlums.

233
00:28:26,137 --> 00:28:27,536
What if they come after
your brother?

234
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:28,696
What should you do then?

235
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,638
If they come, I'll kill them.

236
00:28:31,776 --> 00:28:34,176
You won't kill anybody

237
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:53,459
Ah-feng! Bring the medicine!

238
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:58,158
Hurry! Bring the medicine!

239
00:29:00,171 --> 00:29:02,298
Does it hurt?

240
00:31:07,265 --> 00:31:07,822
Well?

241
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:09,593
No answer.

242
00:31:10,935 --> 00:31:12,562
What'll we do now?

243
00:31:13,137 --> 00:31:14,764
We'll just go over there.

244
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,809
She lives on Hohsi Road.

245
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,503
My older sister said
it is He-xi Road, Kaohsiung.

246
00:31:21,646 --> 00:31:23,876
I think it's the Kangtu Theater
bus stop.

247
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,313
Why don't we take a damned taxi?

248
00:31:26,451 --> 00:31:28,316
Did you burn your head?

249
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:31,047
It would take us for a ride.

250
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:37,084
A bus is safer.

251
00:31:52,110 --> 00:31:54,908
Made a mistake. Sorry.

252
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:55,808
Stupid.

253
00:31:55,947 --> 00:31:56,413
Which bus is it?

254
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:58,515
I thought they all went there.

255
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:01,414
Only No.48 and No.88 go there.

256
00:32:14,732 --> 00:32:16,791
Wrong! Wrong!

257
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,403
He said only No.88 goes there.

258
00:32:30,982 --> 00:32:31,949
That building's great!.

259
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:34,210
I'll live there.

260
00:32:34,352 --> 00:32:37,014
When will you get the money?

261
00:32:39,991 --> 00:32:41,288
This looks like it.

262
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:44,827
This is wrong......Kangtu Theater.

263
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,161
I don't see any theater?

264
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:06,914
Hohsi Road's over there.

265
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:12,784
That's it.

266
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:19,757
Must be there.

267
00:33:19,897 --> 00:33:21,057
No.

268
00:33:21,199 --> 00:33:22,496
That's it up ahead!.

269
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:24,294
Come and look.

270
00:33:25,770 --> 00:33:28,933
No, the west is over there.

271
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:35,036
Where's Hohsi Road, please?

272
00:33:35,179 --> 00:33:37,306
It's above there.

273
00:33:54,766 --> 00:33:58,202
Come see a show, young fellows.

274
00:33:58,336 --> 00:34:00,861
Come on, it is great!

275
00:34:01,005 --> 00:34:01,733
What's it about?

276
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:02,999
They're factory girls.

277
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,165
NT 250.

278
00:34:04,308 --> 00:34:07,436
No, thanks.

279
00:34:12,683 --> 00:34:14,548
What did he want?

280
00:34:19,857 --> 00:34:20,687
Who is it?

281
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,986
Its me, Sis--Ah-jung.

282
00:34:44,715 --> 00:34:46,478
She doesn't let me smoke.

283
00:34:48,119 --> 00:34:51,145
Ah-jung!
what are you doing in Kaohsiung?

284
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:53,484
I came to find a jobs.

285
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,831
You can see Love River from here.

286
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,439
It looks pretty.

287
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,676
What a stink! Smells like Ah-jung.

288
00:35:13,811 --> 00:35:14,175
Really

289
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,404
Like you.

290
00:35:15,546 --> 00:35:17,138
Get serious.

291
00:35:25,923 --> 00:35:27,948
Mom called--Why didn't she tell me?

292
00:35:28,092 --> 00:35:30,151
I didn't tell her.

293
00:35:42,073 --> 00:35:44,871
She said you were taken
to the police.

294
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,443
You broke somebody's head fighting.

295
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:51,347
You want to be a hoodlum?

296
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,418
What kind of job do you want?

297
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:03,322
Where are you going to live?

298
00:36:03,461 --> 00:36:05,088
I'll go to a factory.

299
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:08,156
A factory!

300
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,995
You think it's that easy?

301
00:36:11,135 --> 00:36:14,593
You have an army obligation,
and no skills.

302
00:36:14,739 --> 00:36:16,900
Didn't graduate from high school.

303
00:36:17,041 --> 00:36:19,168
You're just hopeless.

304
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,278
Scalawag.

305
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:33,374
Come.

306
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:42,490
I used to live here with Mei-ju.

307
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:44,857
Huang Chin-ho lives opposite.

308
00:37:44,996 --> 00:37:47,260
I arranged it with him already.

309
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:48,831
You two go find him.

310
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:51,159
Oh, yes

311
00:37:56,574 --> 00:37:58,269
The bathroom is downstairs.

312
00:37:58,409 --> 00:37:59,501
Over there.

313
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:05,644
Huang Chin-ho lives there, you know?

314
00:38:54,765 --> 00:38:56,824
Come look--it's a woman.

315
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:29,792
Who is she?

316
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,367
Must be Chin-ho's wife.

317
00:39:31,502 --> 00:39:33,060
Impossible.

318
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:34,671
Must be his mistress, then.

319
00:39:34,805 --> 00:39:38,002
Mistress! How nice!

320
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:40,667
I'll just get one too.

321
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:42,938
You just wouldn't get
after it before.

322
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:45,913
She's lots better
than Little Cabbage.

323
00:40:26,557 --> 00:40:30,789
Ah-ho, the jacket.

324
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:43,332
Who's Ah-jung?

325
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,038
I am.

326
00:40:45,176 --> 00:40:46,507
I am Huang Chin-ho.

327
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:48,475
Your sister called me.

328
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:51,080
You stay here.

329
00:40:51,215 --> 00:40:52,443
I have to go to class.

330
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,074
We can talk later.

331
00:40:57,521 --> 00:40:59,955
You look familiar.

332
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:01,523
You from Fengkuei?

333
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,820
Your father has a hole in the head?

334
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,656
Got hit with a baseball.

335
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,762
We'll talk when I come back.

336
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:11,902
He's in school.

337
00:41:12,036 --> 00:41:13,663
Night school.

338
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:02,870
You going again?

339
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:30,533
The factory's getting dangerous now.

340
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:32,369
Don't you know that?

341
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:36,011
Don you have to go?

342
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,529
Huang Chin-ho.

343
00:44:38,642 --> 00:44:40,633
Who'll go to market with me?

344
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,973
I'll cock a banguel for lunch.

345
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,241
When I was little,

346
00:46:55,379 --> 00:46:58,405
I play ball with my father once.

347
00:46:58,549 --> 00:47:00,346
I saw a snake.

348
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,385
And Dad killed it.

349
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:08,014
A few days later,
I went back to look.

350
00:47:08,158 --> 00:47:11,127
The snake had dried
into nothing but skin.

351
00:47:11,261 --> 00:47:12,888
How old were you then?

352
00:47:15,265 --> 00:47:16,664
Five or six.

353
00:47:19,002 --> 00:47:21,095
How do you remember it so clearly.

354
00:47:21,238 --> 00:47:23,331
I don't know.

355
00:47:24,541 --> 00:47:27,442
He remembers everything
about his father.

356
00:47:27,578 --> 00:47:29,603
His father is a celebrity
in our hometown.

357
00:47:29,746 --> 00:47:31,304
His father has a black hole
in his head.

358
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:33,439
Once I went to see Ah-ching
and his father kept smiling at me.

359
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:35,415
I was scared to death.

360
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:36,519
What do you mean, black hole?

361
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:38,746
Ask him.

362
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:41,915
He got it playing baseball.

363
00:47:42,059 --> 00:47:44,323
He loved to play baseball.

364
00:47:44,461 --> 00:47:46,725
A ball broke his skull.

365
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,456
His bone got fractured.

366
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:49,725
What happened?

367
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,732
It short-circuited him.

368
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:55,128
Can't get it, Ah-ching.

369
00:47:55,272 --> 00:47:56,500
Who was that woman?

370
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:58,665
Talked so loud.

371
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,777
That was my sister.

372
00:48:03,447 --> 00:48:04,414
What year were you born?

373
00:48:04,548 --> 00:48:05,572
1963

374
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,149
So old?

375
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,548
I thought you were 17.

376
00:48:16,126 --> 00:48:18,594
You from Makung like us?

377
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:20,788
No I'm from Keeling.

378
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,229
Why'd you come down here, all alone?

379
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:38,780
She's mad.

380
00:50:00,397 --> 00:50:01,159
Ah-ching.

381
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,922
Ah-ching.

382
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:10,437
Meet some friends.

383
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:12,232
This is Ah-lin.

384
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,274
Hello.

385
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:14,434
This is Chuan-tza.

386
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:16,375
This is Yung-feng.

387
00:50:16,947 --> 00:50:20,280
He is my friend.

388
00:50:22,819 --> 00:50:25,083
Have a smoke.

389
00:50:31,795 --> 00:50:33,990
Big place.

390
00:50:34,131 --> 00:50:36,463
Can I hide out here?

391
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:39,228
Sure.

392
00:50:41,271 --> 00:50:44,138
A girl, too-- not bad.

393
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:45,172
Have you used her?

394
00:50:45,308 --> 00:50:47,367
No, she is my friend.

395
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:49,945
A friend is a friend.

396
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,843
What's the harm in borrowing her?

397
00:50:51,982 --> 00:50:54,041
What did you say?

398
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:20,764
What are you doing?

399
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,874
Does this look nice?

400
00:53:26,503 --> 00:53:29,131
Wind and rain.

401
00:53:29,272 --> 00:53:31,934
Disaster brings injury.

402
00:53:32,075 --> 00:53:34,771
Success is unlikely.

403
00:53:34,911 --> 00:53:38,278
A trip is in store.

404
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:39,973
No one gives help.

405
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:43,779
Success is elusive.

406
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:49,586
Success is difficult;
marriage is unlikely.

407
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,892
Hsiao-Hsing.

408
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:56,726
Try to think it thoroughly.

409
00:53:56,866 --> 00:53:59,835
I am doing this for us.

410
00:53:59,970 --> 00:54:01,870
Aren't you anxious to get married?

411
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,030
We can't do it without money?

412
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,268
Don't put it so nicely.

413
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:12,905
When did I mention marriage?

414
00:54:13,049 --> 00:54:17,008
Okay, you didn't mention it!

415
00:54:18,622 --> 00:54:21,785
Don't let me see that sour face
any more.

416
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,153
You're crazy.

417
00:55:46,276 --> 00:55:48,540
So salty.

418
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,443
why not get a sweet one?

419
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,710
Who are you looking for?

420
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:01,187
I am Wu Mei-li's brother.

421
00:56:01,324 --> 00:56:03,349
Mei-li's brother.

422
00:56:07,931 --> 00:56:08,898
You are from Penghu?

423
00:56:09,032 --> 00:56:10,761
Yes.

424
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:14,326
Have a seat there!

425
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:21,503
Did you come today, or when?

426
00:56:21,644 --> 00:56:24,374
We came last month.

427
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,610
Who is he?

428
00:56:29,452 --> 00:56:31,352
Who are you?

429
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:34,287
I am your brother-in-law.

430
00:56:34,424 --> 00:56:37,222
Your unregistered brother-in-law.

431
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:38,588
You know?

432
00:56:38,728 --> 00:56:39,922
I don't know.

433
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:44,090
You don't know?
Your sister didn't tell you?

434
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,792
No?

435
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:46,765
You mother know.

436
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:51,067
I met her last time she came here.

437
00:56:57,814 --> 00:56:59,281
Didn't you say you'd come tomorrow?

438
00:56:59,416 --> 00:57:02,317
No, I said I'd come today.

439
00:57:02,452 --> 00:57:04,386
You did. You said tomorrow.

440
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:07,957
You must be deaf. It was today.

441
00:57:08,892 --> 00:57:10,382
Well? Winning or losing?

442
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:11,721
With these three,

443
00:57:11,861 --> 00:57:14,125
how could I win?

444
00:57:15,532 --> 00:57:16,157
Hurry up.

445
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:18,665
Just a minute, let me see.

446
00:57:18,802 --> 00:57:22,533
You brother doesn't know me.

447
00:57:36,519 --> 00:57:37,816
Why aren't you at work?

448
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:38,750
We're off today.

449
00:57:38,955 --> 00:57:39,751
A bonus holiday.

450
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:40,548
What for?

451
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:43,989
The boss is marrying a concubine.

452
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:48,120
She's off;
the boss is marrying a concubine.

453
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:54,369
Didn't your brother take them
to the Kangtu?.

454
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:57,632
Nonsense.

455
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:07,173
I'll lose today, because I saw it.

456
00:58:07,317 --> 00:58:10,587
No,that's only for men.
Want to see a movie?

457
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,680
It doesn't apply to women.

458
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,254
Give me a few hundred.

459
00:58:14,390 --> 00:58:15,084
What for?

460
00:58:15,225 --> 00:58:17,386
To take them for some fun.

461
00:58:18,328 --> 00:58:20,762
Take this thousand.

462
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:23,591
You know where it is?

463
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:26,827
Let's go.

464
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,403
Buy a book! See a movie!

465
00:58:33,543 --> 00:58:35,204
Have some fun, young fellows.

466
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:35,936
I tell you something fun here.

467
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,046
How much does a movie cost?

468
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,010
If you'd like watching movies,

469
00:58:38,147 --> 00:58:40,047
NT$ 300 each, NT$ 900 for three.
C'mon!

470
00:58:40,149 --> 00:58:40,740
How about it?

471
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:41,714
European films,

472
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,081
double feature.

473
00:58:44,220 --> 00:58:45,653
Come on.

474
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:48,723
Come on! I'm telling you straight.

475
00:58:48,858 --> 00:58:51,383
In color, big screen.

476
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:56,788
Here! Here!

477
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,833
It's over there, 11th floor.

478
00:58:58,968 --> 00:59:00,230
Isn't that an empty building?

479
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,930
An empty building is the best
for this.

480
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:06,371
NT$ 300 each, NT$ 900 for three.

481
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:13,105
Change!

482
00:59:13,249 --> 00:59:15,410
Where do we go in?

483
00:59:15,985 --> 00:59:16,713
Hurry up!

484
00:59:16,853 --> 00:59:19,822
Before the policemen come.

485
00:59:41,911 --> 00:59:43,276
Nothing here.

486
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:54,518
We've been had.

487
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:02,692
Big screen, in color.

488
01:00:20,883 --> 01:00:21,975
Let's go get him.

489
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,983
Where? Kaohsiung is a big place.

490
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,917
It isn't Fengkuei, you know.

491
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:27,079
It was you who wanted to come.

492
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:30,056
Okay, no need to talk about it.

493
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,093
We spent NT$ 900 to look
at the view.

494
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:33,388
It's your fault! What a joke.

495
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,793
Who? Say no more about it.

496
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:22,530
Forget it! It's useless to study.

497
01:02:29,946 --> 01:02:30,503
Cops.

498
01:02:30,646 --> 01:02:33,706
Cops, Ah-ching! Cover for me.

499
01:03:01,944 --> 01:03:03,138
What have you done now?

500
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:04,507
Nothing.

501
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:06,808
Just beat up a fellow...

502
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:09,247
With my friend, Ah-lin.

503
01:03:09,385 --> 01:03:11,785
Why hang around
with people like him?

504
01:03:11,921 --> 01:03:12,387
What ever you do,

505
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:15,047
don't let me know.

506
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,280
How about it?

507
01:03:48,191 --> 01:03:50,318
Still questioning.

508
01:03:50,459 --> 01:03:52,927
What's it all about, anyway?

509
01:04:01,070 --> 01:04:02,731
Factory lost some goods.

510
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,198
He's suspect.

511
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:26,057
Actually, he did take them.

512
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,123
I told him,

513
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:31,756
but he wouldn't listen.

514
01:06:02,358 --> 01:06:03,791
Will they lock up Ah-ho?

515
01:06:03,926 --> 01:06:04,790
Lock him up?

516
01:06:04,927 --> 01:06:05,723
He's been fired.

517
01:06:05,861 --> 01:06:08,421
That's bad enough.

518
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:12,126
He would have been promoted
next month.

519
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:14,759
Anyway, it's rotten luck for him.

520
01:06:19,275 --> 01:06:21,072
Did he do it, or not?

521
01:06:22,011 --> 01:06:23,979
Don't poke your nose into it.

522
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,686
If you go to sea,
what about your studies?

523
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:38,418
I'll quit.

524
01:06:38,561 --> 01:06:39,653
Quit? Right.

525
01:06:39,795 --> 01:06:40,727
Why?

526
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:42,387
When I graduate,
there'll be no money to make.

527
01:06:42,531 --> 01:06:43,657
Why are you so stupid?

528
01:06:43,799 --> 01:06:46,495
That make sense, so I don't study.

529
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:47,999
You think the same as I do.

530
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:49,968
Come on.

531
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:58,145
This one we have to drain.

532
01:07:42,058 --> 01:07:42,990
Next time you come here,

533
01:07:43,125 --> 01:07:46,060
when's your wedding banquet?

534
01:07:46,195 --> 01:07:46,786
We'll see.

535
01:07:46,929 --> 01:07:48,760
We'll see.

536
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,690
Peach, cheers.

537
01:08:38,914 --> 01:08:41,075
I will go playing tomorrow.

538
01:08:43,385 --> 01:08:46,218
I am the emperor.

539
01:08:50,593 --> 01:08:54,120
Emperor should go first.

540
01:08:58,534 --> 01:08:59,933
Slippers ran away.

541
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:03,436
Slippers ran away by themselves.

542
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,149
Drink, Peach.

543
01:09:14,283 --> 01:09:16,683
Or buy us more drink, Peach.

544
01:10:48,978 --> 01:10:58,819
Hsiao-Hsing! Hsiao-Hsing!
Hsiao-Hsing!

545
01:10:58,954 --> 01:11:04,017
Hsiao-Hsing, I am leaving tomorrow.

546
01:11:04,159 --> 01:11:08,994
Why don't you keep me be company?

547
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:16,469
Hsiao-Hsing! Hsiao-Hsing!

548
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:20,063
Come in a while, Hsiao-Hsing.

549
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:07,988
Chin-ho...he's gone.

550
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:13,572
Well?

551
01:14:13,715 --> 01:14:14,739
Nothing.

552
01:14:14,883 --> 01:14:15,679
Did you show it to her?

553
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:17,752
Yes, I did.

554
01:14:17,886 --> 01:14:18,750
Then, what did she say?

555
01:14:18,887 --> 01:14:19,546
Nothing.

556
01:14:19,688 --> 01:14:22,054
You fool,
you should stand over there and wait.

557
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:22,623
What embarrass you?

558
01:14:22,758 --> 01:14:23,452
Stop it,

559
01:14:23,592 --> 01:14:25,253
or we will be scold.

560
01:14:42,544 --> 01:14:44,068
I'll resign next week.

561
01:14:44,713 --> 01:14:46,772
My brother-in-law is engaged
in recording tape.

562
01:14:47,216 --> 01:14:48,945
I'm gonna sell it!

563
01:14:49,952 --> 01:14:52,045
I went to see a stall
a few days ago.

564
01:14:53,121 --> 01:14:55,783
I never be rich if I stay here.

565
01:15:26,455 --> 01:15:28,355
I tell you, I'm in bad mood.
Don't joke with me.

566
01:15:28,490 --> 01:15:29,582
Can't good friend joke with you?

567
01:15:29,725 --> 01:15:30,714
I don't like it. So what?

568
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,850
Is that your idea?

569
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:33,791
What kind of friend are you?

570
01:15:33,929 --> 01:15:34,987
What do you want to do?

571
01:15:35,130 --> 01:15:36,154
What do you want to do?

572
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:37,925
How can you say so.

573
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,090
You are not my friend.

574
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:41,327
Try to say it again.

575
01:15:44,673 --> 01:15:47,073
What are you doing, Ah-ching?

576
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:01,285
What are you guys doing?

577
01:16:01,423 --> 01:16:04,119
Stop fighting.

578
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:05,925
Enough, stop it.

579
01:16:06,061 --> 01:16:07,961
Enough, stop it.

580
01:16:30,986 --> 01:16:34,786
Why're they fighting?
Aren't they friends?

581
01:16:34,923 --> 01:16:36,117
How can they act like that??

582
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,556
What a frightful fight.

583
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:40,787
Quiet now.

584
01:16:44,032 --> 01:16:45,260
Come in.

585
01:16:45,400 --> 01:16:49,530
No thanks, I'm going home.

586
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:52,037
Go on then! Go on.

587
01:17:02,017 --> 01:17:05,475
Just a minute, Ah-ching.

588
01:17:15,297 --> 01:17:17,162
Special delivery for you.

589
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:55,530
My father's dead.

590
01:20:48,043 --> 01:20:49,533
Ah-ching.

591
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:52,613
Have something to eat, Ah-ching.

592
01:20:56,251 --> 01:20:59,243
Come eat, Ah-ching.

593
01:21:15,103 --> 01:21:15,694
Time for dinner.

594
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:18,465
What are you sitting here for?

595
01:22:39,621 --> 01:22:41,316
I'm full, Auntie.

596
01:22:45,927 --> 01:22:48,054
Who's this girl?

597
01:22:50,065 --> 01:22:51,225
A co-worker.

598
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:54,565
Girls sure are outgoing these days.

599
01:22:54,703 --> 01:22:56,671
We weren't like that.

600
01:22:56,805 --> 01:22:59,000
Whatever you're doing in Kaohsiung?

601
01:23:00,342 --> 01:23:03,834
Don't think you are out of control.

602
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,812
Don't run wild with the others.

603
01:23:06,948 --> 01:23:09,178
Things have changed at home now.

604
01:23:09,317 --> 01:23:11,751
You've got to think
about things more.

605
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:15,484
Your brother-in-law's factory needs
a worker.

606
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:17,318
Do you want to go?

607
01:23:18,426 --> 01:23:20,189
It's easy work.

608
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:21,625
Do you want to go?

609
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:26,433
Did you hear
what your sister's saying?

610
01:23:26,568 --> 01:23:29,435
You shouldn't go back to Kaohsiung.

611
01:23:29,571 --> 01:23:31,766
Stay home and wait for
the army induction.

612
01:23:31,906 --> 01:23:34,568
If the police get you in Kaohsiung,

613
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:37,269
there'll be nobody to get your bail.

614
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:49,308
Come in.

615
01:24:56,658 --> 01:24:58,649
Who're you looking for?

616
01:25:00,228 --> 01:25:02,059
I'm Chin-ho's friend.

617
01:25:02,197 --> 01:25:03,061
Oh! Chin-ho.

618
01:25:03,198 --> 01:25:06,224
He isn't here,
he's working in Kaohsiung.

619
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:08,562
I know! I am came from Kaohsiung.

620
01:25:08,703 --> 01:25:10,136
Oh...... Who are you?

621
01:25:10,271 --> 01:25:11,431
I'm his co-worker.

622
01:25:11,573 --> 01:25:12,835
His co-worker.

623
01:25:12,974 --> 01:25:15,966
Why didn't he come with you?

624
01:25:16,111 --> 01:25:18,841
He is not in Kaohsiung now.
He went to sea

625
01:25:18,980 --> 01:25:21,642
Went to sea? We didn't know that.

626
01:25:21,783 --> 01:25:23,683
When did he do that?

627
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:25,285
Not long ago.

628
01:25:26,754 --> 01:25:28,346
I'm his sister-in-law.

629
01:25:28,490 --> 01:25:29,980
Come in and have a seat.

630
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:31,888
No, thanks. I have to leave.

631
01:25:32,026 --> 01:25:32,822
It is okay. Sit a while.

632
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:34,952
No, thanks.

633
01:25:36,731 --> 01:25:37,891
Isn't anybody else at home?

634
01:25:38,032 --> 01:25:41,524
No, his father
and brother are at sea.

635
01:25:42,504 --> 01:25:45,803
Thanks. Goodbye.

636
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,838
Bought 100 tapes.

637
01:26:52,941 --> 01:26:54,966
How's business, boss?

638
01:26:55,109 --> 01:26:56,974
Bad. No buyers.

639
01:26:57,111 --> 01:26:58,874
Rotten fart, boss.

640
01:26:59,013 --> 01:27:00,742
Pretend you're buying some.

641
01:27:00,882 --> 01:27:01,507
That make other people buy.

642
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:02,508
That's right. Right.

643
01:27:03,184 --> 01:27:04,344
Look over here.

644
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:05,918
NT$ 10 for three, is it?

645
01:27:06,054 --> 01:27:08,284
NT$ 10, that below cost.

646
01:27:08,423 --> 01:27:12,416
No matter. Big sale!
NT$ 10 for three.

647
01:27:56,971 --> 01:27:58,131
What's the matter?

648
01:28:03,411 --> 01:28:05,242
Have some muskmelon.

649
01:28:10,985 --> 01:28:13,647
Have a piece, it is sweet.

650
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:17,917
Have a piece, Hsiao-Hsing.

651
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,011
Who wrote it?

652
01:28:47,622 --> 01:28:49,214
Huang Chin-ho.

653
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:02,526
I'll going to take a shower.

654
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:26,322
What's his letter say?

655
01:29:29,364 --> 01:29:30,763
He said their ship was broken.

656
01:29:30,898 --> 01:29:32,331
That his ship's being repaired
in Japan.

657
01:29:32,467 --> 01:29:34,731
The company is sending them home.

658
01:31:25,413 --> 01:31:28,871
Hsiao-Hsing, it is almost 7.

659
01:31:32,119 --> 01:31:33,450
You haven't even changed
clothes yet.

660
01:31:33,588 --> 01:31:35,852
Come inside a minute.

661
01:31:52,106 --> 01:31:53,698
Where are you going?

662
01:31:54,942 --> 01:31:56,068
Taipei.

663
01:31:57,778 --> 01:31:59,507
Taipei?

664
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:02,379
I have a sister there.

665
01:32:03,718 --> 01:32:05,811
What'll you do?

666
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:08,046
Find a job.

667
01:32:08,189 --> 01:32:10,248
Don't you have a good job here?

668
01:32:11,492 --> 01:32:13,392
I want to leave.

669
01:32:13,528 --> 01:32:15,553
I don't want to see Ah-ho.

670
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:19,159
Here is my chop.

671
01:32:19,300 --> 01:32:22,827
Please pick up this month's pay
for me.

672
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:26,030
I'll send you my address in Taipei.

673
01:32:26,173 --> 01:32:29,108
You can remit the money to me.

674
01:32:35,917 --> 01:32:37,077
I'll take you to the station.

675
01:32:37,718 --> 01:32:41,245
No, thanks. You have to go to work.

676
01:35:47,408 --> 01:35:49,501
Cheer up! Don't be so glum.

677
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:51,474
Where in the world
is without women.

678
01:35:52,179 --> 01:35:53,612
Kuo Tzu goes in the army in 2 days.

679
01:35:53,748 --> 01:35:55,181
Look at that, we made it ourselves.

680
01:35:55,316 --> 01:35:58,012
