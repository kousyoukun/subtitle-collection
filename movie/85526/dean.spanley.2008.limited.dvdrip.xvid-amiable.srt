1
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,517
Morning.

2
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,237
it is a commonplace observation

3
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,029
that remarkable events
often have ordinary beginnings.

4
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:06,399
Never was this more true
than of my talks with Dean Spanley,

5
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,789
which form the spine of our narrative.

6
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,677
- Morning.
- Morning.

7
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:13,513
Properly speaking,
they began on a Thursday,

8
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:18,913
the day on which i visit my father,
Mr Horatio Fisk.

9
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,913
This habit - one might even say ritual -

10
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,278
commenced after the death of my younger
brother Harrington in the Boer War

11
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:30,669
and the subsequent demise
of my dear mama,

12
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,550
occasioned by her grief
at this unsupportable loss.

13
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:52,598
I'm coming, I'm coming.

14
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,033
Morning, Mrs Brimley.

15
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,315
- How are you today?.
- As you see me.

16
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,516
Could complain,
but what'd be the use of that?.

17
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,511
Yes, indeed.

18
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,797
And himself?.

19
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,350
Oh, he's working himself up
into a head of steam.

20
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,590
You know how he gets.

21
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,990
Sent back the paper, he did,
to have it properly ironed.

22
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,797
I'm just finishing the obituaries,
so you can take it in to him.

23
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,394
I thought he didn't read the obituaries.

24
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:35,474
No more he does, but he wants them
ironed just the same.

25
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,312
Says he doesn't read them

26
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,076
because he's afraid he'II come across
his own name one day. I ask you!

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,788
Do you believe in the transmigration
of souls, Mrs Brimley?.

28
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:06,714
I don't believe in Ietting foreigners in,
if that's what you mean.

29
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:12,158
No, um... reincarnation,
not immigration.

30
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:17,837
Um, the belief that the immortal soul
has many earthly homes.

31
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,269
Well, I haven't given it much thought,
I haven't.

32
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:29,356
After AIbert died
I went to one of them mediums,

33
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,231
but she couldn't get hold of him.

34
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,118
I wasn't surprised, mind you.
He never said much when he were alive.

35
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,919
I couldn't imagine him piping up
once he were dead.

36
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,273
Mind you don't crease that, now.

37
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:47,435
He won't know what day it is,
not having seen the paper.

38
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,711
- Oh, young Fisk. It must be Thursday.
- It is indeed.

39
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,715
Very handy, a Thursday. Keeps
Wednesday and Friday from colliding.

40
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,791
You're here, then.

41
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,995
You should have
the garden seen to, Father.

42
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,197
- That was your mother's job.
- Nevertheless...

43
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,795
Nevertheless. What does
that expression mean, I ask you?.

44
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:12,235
Nevertheless.

45
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,915
Might as well be clearing your throat,
for all the sense it makes.

46
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:23,310
Well, it's a fine day, Father.
Have you anything particular in mind?.

47
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:25,391
I can see how fine the day is.

48
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:29,439
As for particular in mind, everything
is particular when you get down to it.

49
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,273
What I meant was, do you have any plans?.

50
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,869
Are there any concerts or exhibitions,
diversions you wish to attend?.

51
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,030
There's nothing about the war.

52
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,270
We're not presently at war,
as far as I know.

53
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,157
Diversions, you say.

54
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,231
That's all that's Ieft, you know,

55
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,232
before stepping
out of the anteroom of eternity.

56
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,797
There is a display of aboriginal weapons
from our wars of imperial conquest...

57
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,236
Such was the common procedure
of my relationship with my father.

58
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:07,031
i, carrying out my filial duty,
would arrive with the best of intentions.

59
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,989
He, indulging his practised
yet primitive paternal instincts,

60
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,036
would play a strange game of control.

61
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,240
As Thursday upon Thursday arrived,

62
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:23,394
i'd become more and more determined
to see this game dismantled.

63
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:28,156
A collection of Georgian shoe buckles.
Over 2, 000 items.

64
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:33,360
That was an era when a gentleman could
spend a fortune ornamenting his feet.

65
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,636
Did we win the Boer War?.

66
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,433
I believe we Iost more slowly
than the other side.

67
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,795
Garden never recovered from it.

68
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,031
You know, there is a Iecture
by one Swami Nala Prash

69
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,350
on the transmigration of souls.

70
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,510
Poppycock!

71
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:01,593
Think if we had souls they wouldn't
get in touch?. Of course they would.

72
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,035
Think your mother wouldn't be on to me
about that garden?. Of course she would.

73
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,757
Still, it seems the most Iikely
of the Iot, wouldn't you say?.

74
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,230
It's being held at the home
of the Nawab of Ranjiput.

75
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,835
- Isn't that the cricketing Indian chappie?.
- Yes, I believe so.

76
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,036
Oh, well. Let's take a Iook.

77
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,714
Heard tell he's turned the ballroom
into a cricket pitch.

78
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,189
Mad as badgers, these nawabs.

79
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:27,512
Oh, by the way,
I've invested in a chair vehicle.

80
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,558
Makes walking unnecessary.
You'II enjoy it.

81
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,632
Mrs Brimley! My chair!

82
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,236
- Watch your step, young Fisk.
- Thank you, Father.

83
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,551
- How is it going?.
- Very smoothly so far.

84
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,518
So it should. Latest model.

85
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:52,433
Guaranteed to Iast Ionger than the user.

86
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:56,308
- Not that that means very much.
- Nonsense, Father.

88
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,989
Damned machines!

89
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,514
Be the death of all of us, they will.

90
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,115
Progress, Father,
occasions certain inconveniences.

91
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,312
- Galsworthy, old son. How are you?.
- Very well, sir.

92
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,952
Hey-ho! Well done, chair.

93
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,276
Give you a hand with the buggy?.

94
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,510
- Grab hold.
- That's kind of you.

95
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,114
- Buggy, indeed!
- My pleasure, sir.

96
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,430
CIyde-built by the feel of it.

99
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,431
AIways a pleasure.

100
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,636
Thank you. Thank you.

101
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,430
Damn foolish game, cricket,
if you ask me. Too many rules.

102
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:15,192
- Howzat!
- Not out, I say.

103
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:28,192
- Not exactly a full house, is it?.
- This is where you need to go.

104
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,237
Want to be where we can see
the yellow of his eyes.

105
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:37,714
I declare, that's Spanley,
dean of St Justus.

106
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,917
Not that I ever go there,
so he may have been kicked out by now.

107
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,911
- Father, keep your voice down.
- What?.

108
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,433
Shh.

109
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:48,031
Dean Spanley, did you say?.

110
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,429
Not me. Chap with the dog collar.

111
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:54,069
What's a dean doing
at a sermon on reincarnation?.

112
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,596
- Exactly my thought.
- I think it shows open-mindedness.

113
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,355
Impending apostasy, more Iike.
Seen the error of his Christian ways.

114
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:04,273
- The name's Wrather, with a W.
- Fisk.

115
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,636
- What brings you here, Mr Fisk?.
- Ask young Fisk. His idea.

116
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,517
The Iesser of several evils.

118
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,351
Well, there you are.

119
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,431
I thought I got a thin edge onto my pad,

120
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:22,717
but when the umpire raises his finger,
you have to walk.

121
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,314
That's Iife... and cricket.

122
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:28,828
Well, then,
time to bring on Swami Prash.

123
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,514
Of what he will tell you
I have no particular opinion,

124
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,990
but I've always held him in high regard
as a cricketer.

125
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:38,038
Bowled decent Ieft-arm Ieg breaks
before he went holy.

126
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,955
Haven't seen him play since, but I've no doubt
he's still the sportsman he was. Hm.

127
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,397
i confess, the appearance of Swami Prash
came as something of a surprise,

128
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,869
even a disappointment.

129
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:01,873
For although i had no clear expectation
of what a holy man would look like,

130
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:05,396
i had imagined one with such a title
and discussing such a subject

131
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:08,711
to have been dressed more...
traditionally.

132
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,511
The question of
the transmigration of the soul,

133
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:31,436
perhaps more familiarly known to you
as reincarnation,

134
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,830
has been the structural underpinning

135
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,472
of Indian philosophical
and religious thought for millennia.

136
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,039
Only recently...

137
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,271
What ensued proved to be
as unilluminating a 50 minutes

138
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:50,309
as i can remember spending outside
the confines of parliamentary debate.

139
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,039
.. esoteric wisdom
come to the attention...

140
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,557
indeed, the most significant fact
i gleaned from the experience

141
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:04,239
was that with my eyes closed,
the lecturer could have been a Welshman.

142
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,677
A Iittle, if only a Iittle, closer.

144
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,839
I should be pleased now
to answer any questions you may have.

145
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:18,992
- Where am I?.
- Be quiet.

146
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:21,753
You are, my dear sir,

147
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:26,755
in the anteroom of eternity
with the rest of us sojourning souls.

148
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:29,035
- What?.
- Yes, madam?.

149
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,514
I was, er... we were, that is,
wondering if...

150
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,797
- Did he say the anteroom of eternity?.
- Shh.

151
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,394
- What?.
- Shh.

152
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:46,395
- If they...
- Pets, really. The souls of pets.

153
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:52,794
That is a most interesting question
and I thank you for asking it.

155
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:58,753
It is generally supposed
that the animal soul

156
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,832
must be of a different
and, by inference,

157
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:05,515
inferior nature to the human soul.

158
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:11,118
The soul is that part of the Godhead,
of AII That Is...

159
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:15,239
What you said before, sir,
about the anteroom of eternity...

160
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,596
Would you be kind enough to allow
the swami to finish his thought, sir?.

161
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:19,908
- Well, well.
- Shh.

162
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,991
- What?.
- Shh.

163
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:33,119
However, although all animals have
their specific awareness of the Godhead,

164
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:41,910
the dog is, by virtue of his singular
relationship with all mankind, unique.

165
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:44,355
What about cats?.

166
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:48,399
The dog amplifies...

167
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,074
the cat diminishes...

168
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:55,231
man's estimation of himself.

169
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,197
Poppycock!

171
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,594
So I shall wish you gentlemen good day.

172
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:08,559
I can be found here most mornings
and of the occasional evening.

173
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,393
What exactly is a conveyancer?.

174
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:14,030
Well, nothing, exactly.
More a service of facilitation.

175
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:16,429
Assisting a thing
to be moved between parties.

176
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,750
So you're a middleman.

177
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,593
Well, sometimes in the middle
and sometimes at either end.

178
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:25,753
- Been a great pleasure, sir.
- You're easily pleased, is all I can say.

179
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:35,508
Mrs Travers, did I ever tell you that
I collect birds?. I'm a real cornucopian.

180
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:37,511
What's that?.

181
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,073
Only thing that made sense
in the whole damn farrago

182
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,470
was what the chap said about dogs
thinking you are better than you are.

183
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:51,518
Canine flattery is a survival mechanism,
according to Darwin.

184
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,034
The chap never had a dog,
is all I can say.

185
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:56,076
I thought he had a beagle.

186
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:01,109
I had a dog once. Wag.
One of the seven great dogs.

187
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,749
At any one time, you know,
there are only seven. Did you know that?.

188
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,910
I can't say I did.

189
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:10,834
Neither did that swami. Made me think
he didn't know much about dogs.

190
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,071
Let's go to my club, have a stiff one.

191
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,310
I thought you didn't go there any more.

192
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:19,836
That was in the past.
This is the present, young Fisk.

193
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,798
There's no time Iike the present,
as that swami called it.

194
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:27,908
- What was it?. The Eternal Now?.
- I don't know, sir. I wasn't Iistening.

196
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,229
- How are you, Marriot?.
- I'm well, sir. And yourself?.

197
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,153
Oh, one step nearer the grave.

198
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:47,834
How's that boy of yours?.
Tommy, isn't it?.

199
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:51,514
Yes, sir. Tommy, sir.

200
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,711
He... he's dead, sir.

201
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:58,154
The war, sir. The Boer War.

202
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:02,631
Oh, the Boers.
Lost one myself in that nonsense.

203
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:08,352
Haven't seen you for a while, sir.

204
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,191
Hasn't changed much.

205
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:19,875
CIubs aren't supposed to change, surely.
Part of their charm.

206
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:26,308
There's that chap again.
Is he following us?.

207
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,675
Where are you going?.

208
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,957
- Fisk.
- What?.

209
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,395
Horatio Fisk.

210
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:41,632
This is young Fisk. Surprised
we were to see you at the nawab's.

211
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:43,711
Oh, yes, yes.

212
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:48,078
So, what did you make
of all that mumble-jumble?.

214
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,870
The beliefs of others
are always of interest.

215
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:58,318
Really?. Tell me this, then.
Why don't they get in touch?.

216
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,518
Souls, I mean.
Never a word from beyond the grave.

217
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,353
You'd think one of them
would have given a shout.

218
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,159
Well, I imagine if the swami is correct

219
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,630
they're all too busy
being whoever they've become.

220
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:16,109
And what about him pinching my Iine?.

221
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:19,033
- What Iine was that?.
- The anteroom of eternity.

222
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:21,429
Well, I'd rather thought that
common usage.

223
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,069
Not at all.
Out of my own head that came.

224
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:27,230
Rather Iike having your pocket picked.

225
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,711
- What's that you're drinking?.
- Ah, this is Tokay.

226
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:36,635
Not an Imperial, I'm afraid,
but... good enough, for all that.

227
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:39,596
A bit syrupy for my taste.

228
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,316
Well, we'II Ieave you to it.

229
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:50,238
You must excuse my father.
He can be... rather impulsive.

230
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:52,356
Not at all.

231
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,958
Pardon me, Dean, but...

232
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,158
am I to understand you give
some credence to these beliefs?.

233
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:09,148
- Only the closed mind is certain, sir.
- Oh, I agree.

234
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,871
I agree.

235
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,713
- Good day, sir.
- Good day to you, sir.

236
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,990
Rum chap, Spanley.

237
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:34,878
Do you know him well enough
to form that opinion?.

238
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,190
One can tell. Not quite sound.

239
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,909
Dabbling in Eastern religion.
Drinking that Hungarian treacle.

240
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,117
Can I get you gentlemen a drink?.

241
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:49,678
I'd Iike a brandy and soda, Marriot,
with the emphasis on the brandy.

242
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,955
I'II have the Tokay.

243
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:57,433
Oh, I'm afraid that won't be possible, sir.
The Tokay's private stock.

244
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,795
The dean keeps a bottle
for his personal use.

245
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,633
Very hard to come by, I believe.

246
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:06,429
Damned unsociable of him.
Told you the fellow wasn't sound.

247
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:13,392
In that case I'II have a brandy and soda
as well. In the inverse ratio.

248
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,516
Yes, of course, sir.

249
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,958
If I... may say so, Mr Fisk,

250
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,994
I'm most sorry to hear of your Ioss.

251
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,710
- What?.
- Did you... Your boy, sir. In the war.

252
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:36,355
Wasn't my Ioss. He's the one got killed.

253
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:41,439
Sir.

254
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,510
That was, even for you, Father,
a singularly callous remark.

255
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,591
Nothing of the sort.

256
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:52,195
Here we sit about to be served
brandy and sodas.

257
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,795
What's our Ioss
compared to your brother's?.

258
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:04,279
Women with the vote is Iike a cow
with a gun - contrary to nature.

259
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,793
Walking home, listening to my father

260
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:11,998
assert a variety of things
in tones of unbrookable authority,

261
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:16,232
Dean Spanley's words returned to me
with renewed force".

262
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,438
"Only the closed mind is certain. "

263
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:28,159
An excellent hotpot, M rs Brimley.

264
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,798
Well, it ought to be,

265
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:33,873
seeing as how I've made it for you
about five hundred times.

266
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,318
Thank you.

267
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,475
"It may well be supposed
that this turn of events

268
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:45,313
came as a most disagreeable surprise
to Mr Chuttleworth,

269
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,552
accustomed as he was
to having his every whim catered for."

270
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,235
i confess i had, until that moment,

271
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,709
always supposed certainty
to be rather a good thing.

272
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,756
Like money in the bank.

273
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:04,073
But something in the day's events
had occasioned in me a certain disquiet,

274
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,071
a sense that...

275
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,913
There may be more things
in heaven and earth, Horatio,

276
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:11,195
than are dreamt of in your philosophy.

279
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,591
I'II be off, Mrs Brimley.

280
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:54,830
He's dozing in the study.

281
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,799
Oh, I'II have to wake him up,
otherwise he won't sleep tonight.

282
00:24:06,280 --> 00:24:08,316
Does he ever mention my brother?.

283
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:15,440
Your father doesn't hold with grieving,
Mr Fisk, as you well know.

284
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,954
No, that's right.

285
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,792
No, you're right.

286
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,791
Thank you, Mrs Brimley.

287
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:30,829
- And thank you for the hotpot.
- Oh, don't you start, young man.

288
00:24:30,920 --> 00:24:33,388
Hotpot, that's all
he'II Iet me cook for him.

289
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,268
Creature of habit, your father is. Knows
what he wants without having to think.

290
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,828
The certainty of a closed mind.

291
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:45,358
Well, I don't know about that.
But you do know where you are with him.

292
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:48,989
Where you was before. Nowhere.

293
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:54,472
- Bye-bye. I'II see you next Thursday.
- Like as not.

294
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:59,395
Creatures of habit. Oh!

295
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,631
i've heard it said
that one encounter is a happenstance,

296
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:15,352
two a coincidence
and three a significance.

297
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:18,831
Be that as it may,

298
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:24,597
that day i found myself, for the third
time, in the presence of Dean Spanley,

299
00:25:24,680 --> 00:25:29,913
a man who, until that day,
i did not know existed.

301
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,111
Is it stuck up there?.

302
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,796
It rather appears so.
They never think of that when they go up,

303
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,872
which I consider a serious reflection
on their intelligence.

304
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,951
Probably chased by a dog.

305
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,633
Dean?. Dean Spanley?.

306
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,077
Hello. I met you earlier at your club.

307
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:56,869
I was introduced by my father. Mr Fisk.

308
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,552
Oh.

309
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:02,076
- And you were at the nawab's.
- Ah, yes.

310
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:08,591
I am most eager to hear your further
views on the subject of reincarnation.

311
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:11,831
I assure you, sir, I have
no special knowledge on the matter.

312
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,992
Compared to my own,
I'm sure yours are encyclopaedic.

313
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:18,117
I was wondering if I might invite you
to dinner one evening.

314
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:22,193
I'm afraid that with my schedule
that would be rather difficult.

315
00:26:22,280 --> 00:26:25,431
I would not presume
upon so short an acquaintance

316
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:28,956
were it not that I've recently come
into possession of a bottle of Tokay.

317
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:31,031
An Imperial Tokay.

318
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:36,355
- An Imperial Tokay?.
- Yes.

319
00:26:39,320 --> 00:26:44,394
One must be on one's guard against
the common or garden variety. What year?.

320
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:49,588
- An '89, I believe.
- An '89, you say?.

321
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:53,598
Was... is that a good year?.

322
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:58,754
Oh, yes. How do you come to be
in possession of such a treasure?.

323
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:02,071
You must be very well connected, Mr...

324
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:05,516
Fisk. Henslowe Fisk.

325
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,391
Well... Well...

326
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,675
Perhaps I might manage... Thursday,
if that would be convenient?.

327
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,670
Most convenient.

328
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,910
Shall we say seven o'clock?.

329
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,959
- Very well. Until then.
- Good day, sir.

330
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,717
'89. Goodness me.

332
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:35,117
I wouldn't call it a Iie, puss.

333
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:41,192
More Iike a truth deferred.
Nothing worse.

334
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:49,398
it had not occurred to me
when i made my overture to the dean

335
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:53,155
that procuring his favourite tipple
would prove such a challenge.

336
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,231
Oi! Come back here!

338
00:28:04,680 --> 00:28:07,433
Very hard to find
an Imperial Tokay, sir.

339
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,398
Of course there are what you might call
commercial counterfeits.

340
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,994
But the real thing,
that's another story altogether.

341
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:15,799
It's made solely
for the Hapsburg monarchy, you see.

342
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:18,838
Takes a royal decree
to have one uncorked.

343
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,678
You would need to know
somebody with such connections.

344
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,751
I see.

345
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:31,878
Tell me this. If King Edward himself
were to come you and say".

346
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:36,991
"Find me one or two bottles of Tokay",
what would you say to him?.

347
00:28:37,080 --> 00:28:39,833
Well, I would suggest,
most respectfully,

348
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:44,038
that he uses his family connections
in order to affect the conveyancing.

349
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:48,238
So he'd have a Iot more chance
of success than I would, sir.

350
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:51,756
Of course.

351
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,715
The point of the exercise,
drop every ball without a miss.

352
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,474
Care for a small wager?.

353
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:22,315
No, thank you. No, you seem more
than capable of performing such a feat.

354
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:30,032
So you'd Iike to acquire
a bottle of an '89 Tokay.

355
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:32,076
An Imperial.

356
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:34,720
This an adventure of the romantic sort
that you're embarking on?.

357
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,836
Certainly not.

358
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,197
It is said that the fair sex
responds avidly to Tokay.

359
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,989
Loosens the morals
and with it the corsets.

360
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:50,152
- How high are you willing to go?.
- Whatever it costs.

361
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,639
Within reason.

362
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,280
Ah, yes. Well, you see,
there's the rub, within reason.

363
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:58,069
- '89 Tokay not easy to come by.
- So I understand.

364
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:01,751
So what's your Iine, then?.

365
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:04,912
Oh, this and that.
A bit of art publishing.

366
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:06,752
Any money in it?.

367
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,515
A modest remuneration.
But the real reward is in the art itself.

368
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:15,628
Though I must admit there must be
rather more to be made in conveyancing.

369
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:19,713
It's not all mine.
I'm just a ground-floor tenant.

370
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,834
How on earth
did you come by all this stuff?.

371
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:30,754
My Auntie Molly was a hoarder.
Caught it from her, I shouldn't wonder.

372
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,671
What do you do with it?.

373
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,149
Oh, you never know when someone wants
something you just happen to have.

374
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,238
Such as a bottle of Imperial Tokay.

375
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,311
Really?.

376
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,198
Good grief.

377
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:49,909
It's not an '89, I'm afraid.
Will a '91 do?.

378
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,911
It'II have to.

379
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:58,674
I suppose I could say I was promised
an '89 and the man was mistaken.

380
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,151
What do you think?.

381
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,840
- How much is this?.
- Five guineas to you.

382
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,913
Five guineas?.
That's a bit bloody steep.

383
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,709
These Iittle things were sent to try us,
as the man said of the pygmy judge.

384
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,276
Thursday?.

385
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:23,352
Are there not
six other perfectly adequate days,

386
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,830
each equipped with portions of time
suitable for such activities?.

387
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:29,309
Thursday is the only day
the dean is free.

388
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,868
Poppycock.
Deans have dinner every evening.

389
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,313
He has prior engagements.

390
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,437
Is my Thursday not a prior engagement,
young Fisk?.

391
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,794
What is going on?.

392
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,639
You're not getting married, I hope.

393
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,195
- No.
- Good.

394
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,314
If I had it to do over again...

395
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:03,030
Am I to understand from that remark
that you regret marrying Mother?.

396
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,396
Fine woman, AIice.

397
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,671
Very good in the garden.

398
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:17,237
No, it's the children.

399
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:20,756
Hostages to fortune is what they are.

400
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,037
But there is no point
to regretting things

401
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,759
that have gone to the trouble
of happening.

402
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,993
And that is your reason
for refusing to mourn Harrington?.

403
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:35,868
I warned your brother
that the war would be bad for his health,

404
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,916
but no, he knew better, the young fool.

405
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,798
Anyway, your mother mourned him
enough for both of us.

406
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,836
Perhaps if you'd shared
that burden with her

407
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,195
she might not have found her grief
so insupportable.

408
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,148
I have nothing more to say
on this subject.

409
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,959
PIease never mention it to me again.

410
00:32:58,040 --> 00:33:00,270
CIose the door on your way out.

411
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,796
- Do you miss your husband, Mrs Brimley?.
- Miss him?.

412
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:21,153
Oh, well. He weren't hard to miss,
were AIbert.

413
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:24,789
Kept himself to himself.

414
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,759
Sat in that chair night after night,
never said a word.

415
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,675
Just nodded, sociable-Iike,
and spat in the fire every now and again.

416
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,638
That were AIbert's one bad habit.

417
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:43,559
I talk to the chair sometimes
and it's just Iike old times.

418
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,756
Except the chair don't spit.

419
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:58,840
Thinking about your brother
and your mum, are you?.

420
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,120
I just wish Father would...

421
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,510
Well, Mr Fisk was never one
for showing much.

422
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,749
Why, I remember that night
up at the Iake

423
00:34:15,840 --> 00:34:19,230
when you and young Harry went out
on that cockleshell of a boat.

424
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:29,235
Yes. Wasn't one of his finest moments.

425
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,035
I'II Iet you get on, Mrs Brimley.

426
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:39,149
- Good night.
- And don't you worry about Thursday.

427
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:42,789
I'II feed him his hotpot
and he'II be right as rain.

428
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,633
You just enjoy yourself
with your friend.

429
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:20,477
But as Thursday evening arrived, i found
my enthusiasm for the event waning.

430
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,952
For in truth the whim that prompted me
to extend the invitation

431
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,031
had lost its piquancy

432
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:29,793
and the sobering cost of Wrather's Tokay

433
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:34,715
played its part in making the whole
venture seem somewhat dubious.

434
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:43,030
I'm afraid I was mistaken about the vintage.
The '89 was unavailable.

435
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:47,989
This is... this is a '91.
I do hope you're not too disappointed.

436
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,594
Not at all.

437
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,195
One would have to have
a jaded palate indeed

438
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:58,114
if the prospect
of a '91 KIeverheld-Manschliess

439
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,430
were a disappointment.

440
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:05,276
Properly decanted.

441
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:08,238
No sign of sediment.

442
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,150
Well done.

443
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:14,872
Thank you.

444
00:36:21,840 --> 00:36:26,675
To think that such wine was once
only opened by decree of a Hapsburg

445
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:29,638
and now,
through the vicissitudes of history,

446
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,429
we Iesser beings
can command such an audience.

447
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,471
Your very good health.

448
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:49,871
i must confess my first taste of Tokay
was not an illuminating moment.

450
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,274
Rather, my father's dismissal of it
as being too syrupy

451
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:56,510
seemed remarkably close to the mark.

452
00:36:58,120 --> 00:37:03,433
However, in the dean...
its champion was to hand.

454
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:14,029
Oh...

455
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:26,679
Tokay, of course, is unique among wines

456
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:30,719
in that the aroma
is of more significance than the flavour.

457
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:36,432
For us humans, alas, that is the pursuit
of the ineffable by the inadequate.

458
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,155
At such moments, one could wish

459
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:44,471
to possess the olfactory powers
of the canine.

460
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,274
It's often occurred to me
that to pull a dog away from a Iamppost

461
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:59,150
is akin to seizing a scholar in the
British Museum by the scruff of his neck

462
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,356
and dragging him away from his studies.

464
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,191
Yes.

466
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,275
What are you doing?.

467
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,637
One of those damned motor machines.

468
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,359
Dreadful things, don't you think?.

469
00:38:30,080 --> 00:38:33,755
It must be clear to anyone of perception
that the invention of the internal -

470
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:36,912
one might even say infernal -
combustion engine

471
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:41,790
will prove to be a complete...
catastrophe for the species.

472
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,313
Quite so.

473
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,436
And have you noticed

474
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:50,116
that motor cars are exactly the right
height for them to take refuge under?.

475
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:56,754
Cats. The way they get under motor cars
and can't be got at.

476
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,191
Unless, of course,
you're a very small dog.

477
00:39:02,720 --> 00:39:04,597
I see what you mean.

478
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,592
The trouble with cats is
they have no idea of the rules.

479
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,714
One chases them,
invariably they hide or run up trees.

480
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,634
Or perform that preposterous inflation
they're so fond of,

481
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:19,280
raising their hair on end.

482
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:22,116
Well, I was never fooled by that ruse.

483
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,199
No?.

484
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:27,157
Well, perhaps once or twice
when I was very young,

485
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:32,268
but once I discovered what devious
and subversive creatures they are...

486
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:35,830
So you are inclined to agree
with the swami about them.

487
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:40,152
About cats and how they diminish
man's estimation of himself.

488
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,958
Oh, indeed.

489
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:48,038
- They have no awe of the masters.
- The masters?.

490
00:39:48,120 --> 00:39:52,557
Yes. How one Ioved
to be in their company.

491
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:56,428
How one wanted to please them,
if only by obedience.

492
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,677
Let me give you a piece of advice.

493
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:05,036
When a door is opened, always
take the opportunity to Ieave the room.

494
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:07,076
There is nothing more annoying
to the master

495
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:10,630
than a dog whining and scratching
to get...

496
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:24,359
- Tokay?.
- No. No, thank you.

497
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:30,278
Two glasses are my Iimit.
One must know one's Iimit.

498
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:35,035
Otherwise there's no knowing
where things will end up.

499
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,751
i had no idea of the true nature
of what had occurred with the dean.

500
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:46,749
it may have been madness.
But i found it intriguing.

501
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:50,674
So intriguing
that i finished the rest of the bottle.

502
00:40:51,520 --> 00:40:56,275
".. pulling a scholar out of the British
Museum by the scruff of his neck."

503
00:40:58,920 --> 00:41:00,956
It was as if his mind had slipped a cog.

504
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:05,750
- Went barking mad, you mean?.
- No, he was completely rational.

505
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:12,556
If you can call
remembering you were a dog... rational.

506
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:17,760
- How much of the Tokay had he had?.
- Two glasses. Two.

507
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:20,115
Sure it wasn't you that was snockered?.

508
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:22,555
So what do you think?.

509
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:28,553
That getting deans tiddly so they can
pretend to remember when they were a dog

510
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,438
is as harmless a way
of spending an evening as any other.

511
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:34,114
He was not tiddly, as you put it.

512
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:37,158
He was... well, it was more Iike
an altered state of mind.

513
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,515
Being tiddly
isn't an altered state of mind?.

514
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,238
No, it was the Tokay.

515
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:45,234
Even when he inhaled it

516
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:52,116
he was transported to this other place.

517
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:56,040
And you'd Iike to get him back
to this other place?.

518
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,870
Can you get me another bottle?.

519
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,996
Can you?.

520
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:08,868
I don't doubt that for a price
one could come to hand.

521
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,076
Can you get one for next Thursday?.

522
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,276
Have another shot.

523
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:30,829
Your Tokay, Dean.

524
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:35,596
Ah. What Iambency of hue, what colour.

525
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:42,313
It reminds me of the Iight
when the master came home. Hup!

526
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,630
- Never to the brim.
- Of course.

527
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,110
- One must Ieave room for the aroma.
- Yes, yes. The aroma.

528
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:53,994
Now, you were saying about the master.

529
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,270
Oh, yes. The master.

530
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,476
He would go away for very Iong times.

531
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:03,075
Other people were kind,
but it was not the same.

532
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,912
And what did you do?.

533
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:07,639
Why, I'd wait for him
until I knew he was coming home.

534
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,995
- You knew when he was returning?.
- Oh, yes.

535
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:12,435
How, might I ask?.

536
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:16,229
Well, before he was not coming back
and then he was.

537
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,470
That was the difference,
plain and simple.

538
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,632
- I see.
- Yes, seeing is part of it, it's true.

539
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,359
The proximity of the master
does affect the Iight.

540
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,431
The Iight grows brighter?.

541
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:29,910
- No, not brighter. Louder.
- The Iight grows Iouder?.

542
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:33,593
Well, certainly there was more of it.

543
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:37,116
I remember waiting one day
when he was due to come back.

544
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,637
And the Iight that day got brighter
and brighter until one was quite dazzled.

545
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,836
I only know
when he did finally come back

546
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,310
I was so excited
I had several brandies to calm myself.

547
00:43:51,560 --> 00:43:55,348
Dean, dogs do not drink brandy.

548
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,556
No more they do.

549
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:03,428
I would achieve the same effect
by running round in tight Iittle circles.

550
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,717
Drives the blood to the head
in a most exhilarating fashion.

553
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:19,555
And then I'd sit down,
have a good scratch.

554
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,471
Were you much bothered by fleas?.

555
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,915
When I say bothered, I don't mean...

556
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,595
There's nothing wrong with a few fleas.
They help get one's grooming going.

557
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,076
Ah, yes.

558
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:39,518
Indeed, I doubt if one can be a dog
and not have fleas.

559
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:50,317
So these evenings have become
a regular feature, then?.

560
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:54,598
Yes. The dean has a wealth of knowledge
which I find quite fascinating.

561
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,159
Oh.

562
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,515
- Lawrence! Come here!
- No!

563
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:00,192
Lawrence Swan, come back here!

564
00:45:00,280 --> 00:45:04,990
- But only on a Thursday.
- Come back here at once! Lawrence!

565
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:07,913
- That man tripped me up!
- Don't be ridiculous.

566
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,639
- He's given to imaginings.
- Uh-huh.

567
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:15,713
Pick yourself up. I told you before
about running away from me.

568
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:17,438
If I call to you, you come back...

569
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:19,875
What on earth possessed you
to do such a thing?.

570
00:45:19,960 --> 00:45:24,158
No business running off Iike that
when he was being summoned.

571
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,390
You talk as if
you were never yourself a child.

572
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,711
Indeed I was,
and damned glad when it was over.

573
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:32,109
Too much is made of childhood,
to my mind.

574
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:35,192
Golden days of fun and innocence?.
Poppycock.

575
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:38,238
The most miserable I've been
was as a child.

576
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:41,756
Is that why you tripped up him up?.
To teach him childhood isn't a happy time?.

577
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,679
Do not presume to judge me, young Fisk.

578
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,594
I should first have to understand you,
Father. And that, I confess, I do not.

579
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:56,389
Perhaps you would have to become
a father first.

580
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:01,315
Your example disinclines me to that
particular comprehension, I'm afraid.

581
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,870
Push on!

582
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:10,195
Push on!

583
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:25,190
You don't think
the dean is having you on?.

584
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:28,033
What do you mean, having me on?.

585
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:30,634
That he's spotted you
for the gullible sort

586
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,234
and a good source
for his favourite drink?.

587
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:36,073
Why would he assume
that pretending to have been a dog

588
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:40,870
would not attract disbelief and ridicule
rather than invitations to dinner?.

589
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:43,030
He saw you at the nawab's
Iistening to the swami

590
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:45,475
about reincarnation and dogs
and all that nonsense

591
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:48,438
and he decided that you believed
in all that stuff.

592
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:52,676
I can't accept that.

593
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:55,635
It would be
most unlike someone of his gravitas.

594
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,597
Gravitas?.

595
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:00,672
Telling you about running round
in circles to create the effect of whisky?.

596
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,159
Brandy, actually.

597
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,835
And fleas are a good source of grooming?.
You could call that gravitas.

598
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,309
He doesn't know when he's saying
these things and when he isn't.

599
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,073
I'd have to be there
to see it for myself to believe it.

600
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:14,550
- Your Moroccan is here.
- Excuse me. A delivery.

601
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,555
- Go easy on him, my darling.
- Be careful, he's a monkey.

602
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,837
Abdul, how are you?.
And how much do I owe our man?.

603
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,388
- You owe him nothing.
- You tell him he owes me a gin.

604
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,392
- With pleasure, Mr Wrather.
- Good day.

605
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,876
Very nice article, this.

606
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:39,599
Fell off the back of an elephant.
Not interested, are you?.

607
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,990
- Don't have an elephant.
- Just say the word and I'II get you one.

608
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,068
- Look, about this Tokay....
- Yeah, right. Tokay.

609
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,071
How about if I do round one up,
you Iet me sit in on the next seance?.

610
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,276
It's not a seance.

611
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:04,796
It's more Iike the parting of the veil
between one Iife and another.

612
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:08,998
AII right. The parting of the veil.
But I want to be there.

613
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:12,951
AII right.

614
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:16,473
But you must promise,
truly and genuinely promise me,

615
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,790
that you will Iet me
do the questioning.

616
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,440
- Cross my heart and hope to die.
- Swear on something you hold sacred.

617
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:23,750
- 50 guineas.
- What do you mean?.

618
00:48:23,840 --> 00:48:27,389
I give you 50 guineas to hold and if I don't
meet your standard of decorum, I forfeit it.

619
00:48:27,480 --> 00:48:30,677
Am I to understand
that there is nothing you hold sacred?.

620
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,718
I feel quite religious about 50 guineas,
I assure you.

621
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,994
I can only imagine
that I was not in my right mind

622
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,036
to have spoken to you in such a fashion

623
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:46,398
and it grieves me to think that I may have
offended you by my Iack of respect.

624
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:51,600
I am stricken to think I have given you cause
to think me ungrateful.

625
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:56,754
Don't grovel, Iaddie. You remind me
of Wag when he'd been naughty.

626
00:48:56,840 --> 00:49:00,913
What a whining and squirming
he went in for!

627
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,878
Yes. Wag, eh?.

628
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:06,758
One of the seven great dogs.

629
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:11,152
At any one time, you know,
there are only seven.

630
00:49:13,040 --> 00:49:18,592
- What kind of dog was he?.
- A Welsh spaniel, in his prime.

631
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:22,631
What happened to him?.

632
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:26,190
He went away one day
and never came back.

633
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:31,355
- Had he ever done that before?.
- Never.

634
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,908
I blame the bad company he fell in with.

635
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,878
This dog that used to come around.

636
00:49:36,960 --> 00:49:40,509
Ugly brute, a mongrel.
Big scrawny thing, it was.

637
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:43,319
Wag chased him off at first
but he came back

638
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,518
and Wag took off with him
just before I had to return to school.

639
00:49:47,600 --> 00:49:51,991
I wanted to stay at home till Wag came back,
but they wouldn't allow it.

640
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:58,599
I told them if I wasn't there,
then Wag might not know where to come to.

641
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:00,955
Must have been very difficult for you.

642
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:04,436
It wasn't difficult.

643
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,676
It was unbearable.

644
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:12,311
i had heard this story before.

645
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:16,678
But now it was as if
i was hearing it for the first time.

646
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,149
As dubious as any connection
might have seemed,

647
00:50:19,240 --> 00:50:23,119
my father's revelation
inspired greater significance

648
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,589
to my next encounter with the dean.

649
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,630
Who's this Iikely-Iooking Iad?.

650
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:38,713
That's my brother Harrington.
He was killed fighting the Boers.

651
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,551
Broke my mother's heart.

652
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:44,596
And your father, how did he take it?.

653
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:49,194
"If something goes to the trouble
of happening,

654
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,316
it may be considered inevitable"

655
00:50:51,400 --> 00:50:53,231
was his comment, I believe.

656
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,629
That's your stiff upper English for you.

657
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:59,759
There's a few shillings Ieft in this.
The cobwebs are worth a guinea.

658
00:50:59,840 --> 00:51:02,070
No, please. Not the Iast inch.

659
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:04,674
The dean is most particular about that.

660
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:07,399
Fussy old hound.
What kind of dog did he say he was?.

661
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,155
He didn't. I must insist
you don't ask him such a question.

662
00:51:11,240 --> 00:51:14,073
I'd have thought
that's the first question you would ask.

663
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,037
PIease just give me your word.

664
00:51:16,120 --> 00:51:19,954
As you Iike, but there's no doubt I'II know
as soon as he gets started.

665
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,232
Henslowe.

666
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,675
- Good evening, Dean. How are you?.
- Very well.

667
00:51:26,760 --> 00:51:30,514
I fancy I would have been
a pointer, an Afghan...

668
00:51:30,600 --> 00:51:32,875
- This is my friend Mr Wrather.
- Oh.

669
00:51:35,600 --> 00:51:39,388
Mr Wrather is the agent
by which we manage to procure the Tokay.

670
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:43,837
- Mm.
- Good evening... Dean.

671
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:45,911
Yes.

672
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:54,513
Tonight's vintage is... a special one.

673
00:51:54,600 --> 00:52:00,277
KIeinfeld-Hasslerbeck '82.
One of the great years.

674
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:05,593
Indeed, I've not had the good fortune
to taste that particular vintage before.

675
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:08,717
Well, every dog has his day,
as they say.

676
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:16,556
Well, what a privilege.

677
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,517
Dean.

678
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,636
Of course
the Empire must be maintained,

679
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,078
but history shows us only too clearly
the dangers of overreach.

680
00:52:26,160 --> 00:52:30,836
I myself considered the Indian Mutiny,
so-called,

681
00:52:31,920 --> 00:52:35,310
a warning that perhaps
our presence on the subcontinent

682
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:39,279
was not the universal benevolence
that we believed.

683
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:49,392
- A glass of Tokay, Dean?.
- That would be most agreeable.

684
00:52:52,080 --> 00:52:56,631
So, Dean, do you think it's true that
you can't teach an old dog new tricks?.

685
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,554
- What Mr Wrather means is...
- Will we ever give India back to the Indians?.

686
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,349
Not in my Iifetime, I would venture.
We've become too dependent on it.

687
00:53:04,440 --> 00:53:06,431
And I don't just mean economically,

688
00:53:06,520 --> 00:53:10,433
although we derive inordinate treasure
from its exploitation.

689
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:15,674
No, we have become habituated
to the role of master...

690
00:53:15,760 --> 00:53:17,830
and dog...

691
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:21,511
servant.

693
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:27,870
How elegant.

694
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,316
- My, my, my, my, my, my.
- Is it all you'd hoped for, Dean?.

696
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:42,111
Oh.

697
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:45,434
Beyond hope, beyond imagining.

698
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:50,075
The actuality exceeds anticipation.

699
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,879
I am in your debt, sir.

700
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,315
And yours, Mr Wrather.

701
00:54:00,000 --> 00:54:03,037
You were saying about...
our relationship with the Indians,

702
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:06,999
between the master and the servant?.

703
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,833
Not just servant, but Ioving servant.

704
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,676
It's most important to the English race
that we are Ioved by those that we rule.

705
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,830
With a dog-Iike devotion, would you say?.

706
00:54:19,600 --> 00:54:24,116
What is it that's so important
about the master?.

707
00:54:26,840 --> 00:54:28,831
Yes, the Master.

708
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:34,949
The thing is, whenever he returned
from wherever he'd been,

709
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,110
no matter how Iong I'd been waiting,

710
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:41,432
the actuality
always exceeded the anticipation.

711
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,670
Causing you to run about in circles.

712
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,754
But, you know, for all his great wisdom,

713
00:54:49,840 --> 00:54:52,434
there were certain things
the Master never understood.

714
00:54:52,520 --> 00:54:56,559
- Such as?.
- The moon... and ticks.

715
00:54:56,640 --> 00:55:00,394
The Master always wanted to remove mine,

716
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,948
but my own motto was". Iive and Iet Iive.

717
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:05,076
I hate ticks.

718
00:55:07,800 --> 00:55:10,030
And the moon?.

719
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,511
Yes, the moon.

720
00:55:13,600 --> 00:55:17,275
The Master wasn't nearly
suspicious enough of the moon.

721
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,596
I never trusted it.
Never the same two nights in a row.

722
00:55:26,560 --> 00:55:28,551
Couldn't hear it. Couldn't smell it.

723
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:33,232
Well, you can take your own Iine
on that, and others do.

724
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:36,909
I had a friend who never worried
about the moon, but then...

725
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,753
he didn't have a house to guard.

726
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:44,118
The moon had a way of Iooking at a house
that implied it wasn't guarded properly.

727
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:48,113
Well, my house was guarded properly,
thank you very much, and I told it so,

728
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,634
every time it came around,
in no uncertain terms!

729
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:03,955
- Were you very big?.
- Oh, yes.

730
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:06,956
How big?.

731
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:11,272
When I barked... I was enormous.

732
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,474
So... why do you think
it wasn't frightened?.

733
00:56:18,560 --> 00:56:22,872
Well, frightened things
smell frightened.

734
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:25,076
I've smelled many frightened things.

735
00:56:25,160 --> 00:56:28,550
Cats, elderly Iadies, children, rabbits.

736
00:56:28,640 --> 00:56:32,110
They all smell of being frightened.
It's a wonderful smell.

737
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:38,799
You mean... old Iadies smell the same
as rabbits when they're frightened?.

738
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,795
No, their fear smells the same.
Otherwise there's no confusing them.

739
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:50,912
Yes, this, erm... this business of smell
is very interesting, isn't it?.

740
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:53,195
Interesting.

741
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:56,192
If there's one thing
I could find fault with the Master,

742
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:58,316
it would be on that issue.

743
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:03,428
I have known occasions when I was studying
a message Ieft for me by a friend

744
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:07,354
and he would drag me away by the collar
in the middle of the most fascinating passage.

745
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:10,557
Rather Iike dragging a scholar
away from a text at the British Museum.

746
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:13,996
That is a rather untoward analogy.

747
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:16,753
No, most apposite.

748
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:21,391
I believe I have thought
exactly the same thing.

749
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:26,029
What sort of a dog were you, anyway?.

750
00:57:27,840 --> 00:57:29,796
I beg your pardon?.

751
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,996
I mean in your day.

752
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:34,469
You know, before you took...

753
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,790
holy orders.

754
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:39,713
I recall no such activity, sir.

755
00:57:58,920 --> 00:58:01,115
Quite a session. Damn good value.

756
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:04,317
Listen, I've been thinking.
This is getting out of hand.

757
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:07,990
The man is clearly
suffering from delusions.

758
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:10,116
And as for the Tokay...

759
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:12,919
I sincerely hope
I never develop a taste for it.

760
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:15,992
It's hard to find
and devilishly expensive.

761
00:58:16,080 --> 00:58:19,834
Ten guineas to hear a dean say
he believed he was once a dog!

762
00:58:19,920 --> 00:58:21,911
I must be mad.

763
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,991
- Good as gold.
- Shh.

764
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:27,755
I don't want your money.
This has gone too far.

765
00:58:27,840 --> 00:58:32,595
- But you can't stop now, young Fisk.
- Well, I see no point in continuing.

766
00:58:32,680 --> 00:58:37,310
The man believes what he believes.
That's that.

767
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:47,589
You're not one of these blokes
who gives up before he can Iose, are you?.

768
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:49,716
Are you?.

769
00:58:54,360 --> 00:58:58,399
What if I was to procure
a bottle of the elixir for free?.

770
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:00,198
For free?.

771
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:12,833
This bloke owes me. He owes me more
than one favour too, I'II tell you that.

772
00:59:12,920 --> 00:59:17,948
And if anyone's got a bottle or two,
His Nawabship will.

773
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:24,554
Tokay, you say?. An Imperial?.

774
00:59:24,640 --> 00:59:27,598
- We're finding it hard to come by.
- I should jolly well think so.

775
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:31,116
Rather extravagant
being so keen on it, I'd say.

776
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,270
- You must be quite the connoisseur.
- It's not for him.

777
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:35,954
It's for Dean Spanley.

778
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:39,430
For Spanley?.
OId Wag Spanley Iikes Tokay?.

779
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,717
(Wrather) Very partial to a drop,
the dean.

780
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:47,590
Excuse me. Did you just
call Dean Spanley Wag?.

781
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,638
Walter Arthur Graham. Wag Spanley.

782
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,234
Before my time,
but my father knew him at Oxford.

783
00:59:53,320 --> 00:59:58,553
But tell me, why are you so intent
on plying him with Tokay?.

784
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:04,272
Well, it has to do with...
one of the major tenets of your religion.

785
01:00:04,360 --> 01:00:05,588
Bat and pad together
when playing forward?.

786
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:11,513
- Reincarnation, actually.
- Don't go in for it myself.

787
01:00:11,600 --> 01:00:15,115
I mean, I'm not going to do
much better next time round, am I?.

788
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,191
This innings will do me nicely.

789
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:20,989
Reincarnation is all right for the masses.
Gives them something to Iook forward to.

790
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:23,833
About the Tokay, Iook in the cellar.
Galsworthy will show you.

791
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,797
There's all sorts down there.

792
01:00:25,880 --> 01:00:28,440
Wouldn't be surprised
if you found the odd case of Tokay.

793
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,829
Don't Iike it myself.

794
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:35,152
Last time I drank it,
I dreamt I was a monkey.

795
01:00:36,760 --> 01:00:39,672
Thought the funny bugger might have
a dozen hanging around.

796
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:42,672
Should be more than enough there to get
the old boy back to when he was a pup.

797
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:47,629
My father used to have a dog
when he was a child. Name of Wag.

798
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,756
You know, I've been thinking.

799
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:52,479
Lady I know, in the thespian way,

800
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:55,711
thought we might give her
a bottle of the Imperial.

801
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:59,190
Lovely girl.
Lot of fun when she's tight.

802
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:05,516
I think for that to be significant,
you'd have to suppose two things,

803
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:07,556
neither of which are improbable.

804
01:01:07,640 --> 01:01:12,589
One, that the dean's mum and dad knew that
he'd previously been your father's pooch,

805
01:01:12,680 --> 01:01:15,274
and two, to commemorate the event,

806
01:01:15,360 --> 01:01:19,114
decided to incorporate his doggy name
into his Christian name.

807
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,829
It may Iook Iike a boat but it doesn't float,
as my Aunt Molly used to say.

808
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:26,276
And why would I want
to have dinner with a dean,

809
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:29,636
Iet alone one
who believes in reincarnation?.

810
01:01:29,720 --> 01:01:32,951
Because you're always complaining that
I neglect you on my evenings with Spanley.

811
01:01:33,040 --> 01:01:35,031
I thought you'd Iike to come with us.

812
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:38,760
Wrather will be there. You remember him.

813
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:43,869
The conveyancer... from the Iecture.

814
01:01:45,160 --> 01:01:47,196
Can't say as I do.

815
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:53,516
It must be here, this gathering.
Certainly not at that rickety place of yours.

816
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:57,593
- Can Mrs Brimley cook for four?.
- She can make more of her hotpot.

817
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:01,070
Father, we are having
a Shevenitz-Donetschau '79.

818
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:04,436
And I do not think the hotpot,
sustaining though it may be,

819
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:06,875
is quite the precursor for a '79 Tokay.

820
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:09,679
Damn fuss over fermented grapes.

821
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:13,271
What is this all to do with?.

822
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:16,432
The dean, the Tokay, this dinner?.

823
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,557
If I were to tell you, Father,
you would not believe me.

824
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:24,794
In that case, don't tell me.
I don't believe in enough things already.

825
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:28,793
Well, it won't be the hotpot,
that's all I can say. Ha!

826
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:31,235
I'm not serving hotpot to a dean.

827
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:33,276
I could do the navarin.

828
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:36,318
With the sorrel and cucumber soup
to start.

829
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:41,838
Or maybe Ieek and potato. What your
father calls the Vicious Swiss soup.

830
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,911
Either would be most welcome.

831
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:50,629
Mrs Brimley, do you remember
my father's dog, Wag?.

832
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:54,110
And for dessert... profiteroles.

833
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:55,679
I think it was a spaniel.

834
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:59,719
My choux pastry is too good to be eaten,
if I say so myself.

835
01:03:01,960 --> 01:03:07,318
Wag?. No, not really.
I remember it run off, though.

836
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:10,597
What a to-do that was.
Like a death in the family.

837
01:03:10,680 --> 01:03:13,274
Upset him ever so.

838
01:03:13,360 --> 01:03:16,511
Why didn't he get another,
I asked him once. Know what he said?.

839
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:20,149
That Wag was one of
the seven great dogs?.

840
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,710
- Oh. I see he talked to you about it.
- Mm-hm.

841
01:03:25,800 --> 01:03:30,430
Maybe profiteroles would be too heavy
after the Iamb.

842
01:03:33,160 --> 01:03:35,958
Raspberry and gooseberry fool.

843
01:03:37,760 --> 01:03:41,594
Whatever you decide, Mrs Brimley,
I'm sure will be splendid.

845
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,040
- A '79?.
- Yes, indeed.

846
01:03:48,120 --> 01:03:51,237
Really, my dear Henslowe,
you are a man of remarkable resource.

847
01:03:51,320 --> 01:03:54,676
Oh, it's not I
who provided this trove, sir.

848
01:03:54,760 --> 01:03:57,832
My father, whom I believe
you have met before.

849
01:03:57,920 --> 01:03:59,672
Yes, I believe I do recall.

850
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:03,833
I was rather hoping that he might join us
for our next evening together.

851
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:05,956
I see.

852
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:10,394
- And your friend.
- Wrather. Mr Wrather.

853
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,471
Wrather, yes.

854
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,599
I have the strangest feeling, you know,
after our Iast encounter,

855
01:04:16,680 --> 01:04:18,830
that I know Mr Wrather.

856
01:04:18,920 --> 01:04:21,150
Perhaps from a previous Iife.

857
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:25,518
- I was not always a dean, you know.
- No?.

858
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:29,070
No. I was in accountancy at one time.

859
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:33,517
A dismal business,
at Ieast in the regions where I toiled.

860
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:37,150
And you feel Iike
you met Mr Wrather then?.

861
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,629
Yes, it's possible.
Or perhaps it's his being a colonial.

862
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:45,953
One often feels one has met them before.

863
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:53,672
So... can I hope for your company
this Thursday?.

864
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:59,676
I do feel only your palate
can fully appreciate a '79.

865
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:04,390
A '79. What splendours.

866
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,675
A bottle of the '79.

867
01:05:06,760 --> 01:05:08,751
Three bottles.

869
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:15,556
Best to Iet sleeping dogs Iie,

870
01:05:15,640 --> 01:05:17,835
- if you know what I mean.
- Yes, I know what you mean.

871
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:20,673
What if he recognises your father,
Iicks his hands?.

872
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:23,479
That could be damned embarrassing.

873
01:05:25,280 --> 01:05:29,114
Pygmy judge, old man. Pygmy judge.

874
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:36,828
So there we were, on our holidays
in this cottage on the shore of Windermere.

875
01:05:36,920 --> 01:05:40,310
Wonderful spot to get some reading done

876
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:44,109
and I was availing myself
of the tranquillity to do just that.

877
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,272
This fellow here, young Fisk,
and his brother

878
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,590
were out on the Iake in a rowboat.

879
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,069
Storm came up.

880
01:05:52,160 --> 01:05:55,311
One minute it's all
"I wandered Ionely as a cloud",

881
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:00,155
the next it's blowing hell's bells
and howling Iike a banshee.

882
01:06:00,240 --> 01:06:04,756
Mrs Fisk, she comes in,
wringing her hands.

883
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:10,278
"Our boys," she cries at me,
"They're out on the Iake."

884
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:15,068
You have no idea how taxing it is

885
01:06:15,160 --> 01:06:18,550
to be dragged out of a book
in which you are thoroughly engaged.

886
01:06:18,640 --> 01:06:22,235
"You must do something, Horatio,"
she said to me.

887
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:29,835
"Our boys are in great danger.
Do something," she implored me.

888
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:36,155
So I got up, Iaying aside Balzac
with the greatest reluctance,

889
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:40,153
and went to the window,
opened the shutters.

890
01:06:41,080 --> 01:06:44,197
Whitecaps as far as the eye could see.

891
01:06:44,280 --> 01:06:47,033
I stared out into the maelstrom

892
01:06:47,120 --> 01:06:53,070
and I raised my hands and called out
in my most stentorian tone".

893
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,953
"Give up your dead!"

894
01:06:58,040 --> 01:07:01,237
Which was a great comfort,
as you can imagine, to my mother.

895
01:07:01,320 --> 01:07:05,279
When one is helpless,
I see no point in pretending otherwise.

896
01:07:05,360 --> 01:07:10,388
How terrible that must have been
for your mother. And you too, sir.

897
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:13,392
When something has gone
to the trouble of happening,

898
01:07:13,480 --> 01:07:17,029
it is best to consider it inevitable,
in my opinion.

899
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:19,839
Learned that Iesson the hard way, I did.

900
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:21,911
Well, Iet us, erm...

901
01:07:23,320 --> 01:07:28,553
Let us drink to the inevitable...
before it happens.

902
01:07:34,160 --> 01:07:37,675
Not a bad drop.
I'm beginning to get a hang of this stuff.

904
01:07:39,320 --> 01:07:42,153
Too much Iike toilet water for my taste.

905
01:07:42,240 --> 01:07:44,754
CIear away the rest, Mrs Brimley.

906
01:07:44,840 --> 01:07:47,638
She makes a very good hotpot,
I should tell you.

907
01:07:49,920 --> 01:07:51,911
Well, Iet's take this
in the drawing room.

908
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:57,836
If you wouldn't mind, sir, I should prefer
to remain here to enjoy my Tokay.

909
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:00,275
Oh?. And why is that?.

910
01:08:00,360 --> 01:08:03,557
I cannot really say. I...

911
01:08:03,640 --> 01:08:09,112
Sometimes you get comfortable where
you are. You don't want to disturb yourself.

912
01:08:09,200 --> 01:08:12,556
Poppycock. Port should be taken
in the drawing room.

913
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:15,677
Let the Iadies get on
with whatever it is they get on with.

914
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:17,716
I'm no Iady.

915
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:22,191
It's rather Iike being bathed when one has just
gotten comfortable in one's smell.

916
01:08:22,280 --> 01:08:25,158
- What is the fellow on about?.
- Shh.

917
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:30,109
There was a patch of ground behind
the shed where the earth was always moist

918
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:35,149
and I Ioved to roll there
to get that particular aura around me.

919
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:39,472
It brought out the natural secretions

920
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:43,951
so one could feel there was a glow
around oneself, Iike a halo.

921
01:08:46,200 --> 01:08:51,877
And it was then, when one felt so complete,
that the Master would call me.

922
01:08:55,120 --> 01:08:59,511
Who, in God's name, called you what?.

923
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,593
The Master. He called me Wag.

924
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:08,315
For reasons I never understood. Wag.

925
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,671
But that was
the greatness of the Master,

926
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:15,070
that he could make that one sound
convey so many meanings.

927
01:09:15,160 --> 01:09:18,072
There was a "Wag" which meant a walk.

928
01:09:18,160 --> 01:09:22,711
There was a "Wag" which meant
"Go away from the table"

929
01:09:22,800 --> 01:09:27,874
and there was a "Wag" which meant
"You are to be bathed."

930
01:09:27,960 --> 01:09:31,669
And of all the "Wags"
that "Wag" was the most terrible.

931
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,557
Why was that?.

932
01:09:33,640 --> 01:09:35,551
Because, for all his great wisdom,

933
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:39,076
he never understood how embarrassing
it is to meet another dog

934
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:42,391
when one isn't wearing one's own smell.

935
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,074
But more importantly,
they did not know who you were,

936
01:09:45,160 --> 01:09:49,472
so you had to go through all that business
of circling and sniffing and growling.

937
01:09:51,160 --> 01:09:54,436
I was always being embarrassed in that way
with a particular friend of mine.

938
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,830
So what did you do?.
Did you have to fight him?.

939
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:01,674
Oh, we fought a few times,
just to get acquainted. That I enjoyed.

940
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,795
My favourite grip was the ear.

941
01:10:04,880 --> 01:10:09,351
You always hear how going for the throat
is the best approach,

942
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,432
but in my experience it's almost impossible
to get a throat grip,

943
01:10:12,520 --> 01:10:15,273
so I would always go for the ear.

944
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:19,916
But it does give the opportunity
for excellent complaint.

945
01:10:21,000 --> 01:10:23,594
My friend had a very good complaint,

946
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:27,389
which I memorised and I would use
if I had to take a beating from the Master.

947
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:29,516
- He beat you?.
- Only...

948
01:10:29,600 --> 01:10:32,956
On certain occasions it was called for,
certainly.

949
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,237
Then I would use this splendid complaint
which I'd Iearned from my friend.

950
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:39,596
So what was his name,
this friend of yours?.

951
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:44,959
His name?. I don't think I knew
the name his master called him.

952
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,476
Indeed, I'm not entirely sure
he had a master,

953
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:51,916
but his complaint was most satisfying.

954
01:10:54,040 --> 01:11:00,434
"Oh, rescue me. I'm a poor, unfortunate
creature, far from home and without a friend."

955
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,078
"Help me, help me."

956
01:11:02,160 --> 01:11:05,789
"I have fallen into terrible straits
and am about to be murdered."

957
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,348
Which, of course, was not the case.

958
01:11:08,440 --> 01:11:13,833
This dog, the one without a master,
what sort of dog was he?.

959
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:20,519
Oh, the best of fellows. Adventurous
and carefree, fearless and bold.

960
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:25,230
But you said he was whining
and snivelling about being murdered.

961
01:11:25,320 --> 01:11:27,595
Oh, that was just his complaint.

962
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:29,750
How did you meet him,
this friend?.

963
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:36,036
He would Ieave messages
on the cart that brought the milk.

964
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,391
And i would reply.

965
01:12:02,640 --> 01:12:05,598
And then one day, he came to our door.

966
01:12:06,400 --> 01:12:08,994
Well, I told him to go away
or I would chase him

967
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:12,311
and I barked my most enormous bark
and made myself very huge.

968
01:12:13,760 --> 01:12:15,830
But he wasn't afraid and said so.

969
01:12:16,840 --> 01:12:22,119
You weren't... how will I put it...
a female by any chance, were you?.

970
01:12:22,760 --> 01:12:24,512
- Of course he wasn't.
- Not at all.

971
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,750
We were just good friends.

972
01:12:29,320 --> 01:12:33,916
He'd Ied a very interesting Iife
and knew many more things than I did,

973
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:36,309
which he told me about
in considerable detail.

974
01:12:36,400 --> 01:12:39,836
- How did he tell you?.
- In the messages that he Ieft me.

975
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,076
And I would Ieave word of my doings,

976
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:45,469
which, I confess, were not comparable to his,

977
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:48,916
because all I'd ever done was
go for evening walks with the Master.

978
01:12:49,000 --> 01:12:51,150
And while they were enjoyable outings,

979
01:12:52,600 --> 01:12:56,878
they were but moon-cast shadows
compared to his adventures.

980
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,952
Did you ever go
on an adventure with him?.

981
01:13:00,040 --> 01:13:03,157
(Spanley) Indeed.
The greatest of my Iife.

982
01:13:04,240 --> 01:13:07,073
i remember the Master had to go away
and i couldn 't go with him.

983
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:09,355
And i was going to follow him,

984
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:14,150
but then my friend came
and he proposed we have an adventure.

985
01:13:21,200 --> 01:13:24,590
Since the Master was leaving,
i said yes.

986
01:13:24,680 --> 01:13:26,591
And off we went.

987
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:41,798
What a day that was to be a dog and
to be with one who knew how to be a dog.

988
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:45,077
For I confess, happy though I was
to belong to the Master,

989
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:51,395
until that day I had barely glimpsed
the glories of dogdom.

990
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:57,994
He introduced me
to the joys of chasing animals.

991
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,629
A matter in which
I was Iargely unversed,

992
01:14:01,720 --> 01:14:04,712
having previously only had the opportunity
to chase a couple of cats.

993
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:07,796
Cats are of no use for chasing

994
01:14:07,880 --> 01:14:10,519
for, not knowing the rules,
they invariably climb up trees,

995
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:13,114
a habit I find contemptible.

996
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:17,159
Horses, on the other hand,
understand the rules perfectly

997
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:19,754
and enter the business in good spirit.

1000
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,917
But of all the creatures
that a dog can chase,

1001
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:44,596
none exceed sheep for sheer pleasure.

1003
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:55,428
Their fear drifts in clouds behind them
and you breathe it in as you run along,

1004
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:58,159
so you become quite intoxicated by it.

1005
01:14:59,960 --> 01:15:04,795
it's as if one is not so much running
but flying on it.

1006
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:09,112
Or perhaps swimming
might be more a exact description.

1007
01:15:10,280 --> 01:15:14,432
Were it not for their master appearing,
we might have chased them all day.

1008
01:15:17,640 --> 01:15:19,437
Be gone!

1009
01:15:19,520 --> 01:15:21,397
My friend didn't care,

1010
01:15:21,480 --> 01:15:24,995
but I thought we might be seized
and prevented from further adventures,

1011
01:15:25,080 --> 01:15:27,719
so I persuaded him to Ieave.

1012
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,439
So we went into the woods.

1013
01:15:30,520 --> 01:15:35,150
And there we had the good fortune
to come across... a rabbit.

1014
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:43,311
It's not commonly known
that rabbit scent,

1015
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,995
particularly when it's frightened -
and this one was very frightened indeed -

1016
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:49,230
does not Iie along the ground,

1017
01:15:49,320 --> 01:15:54,110
but rises in heaps
so you have to jump to inhale it.

1018
01:15:56,080 --> 01:16:00,073
When we'd had our fill of its fear,
we turned to catching it,

1019
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:04,915
and in this endeavour my friend showed
what a splendid fellow he was,

1020
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:07,833
for he drove
straight through the thicket,

1021
01:16:07,920 --> 01:16:10,832
paying no heed
to its many inconveniences,

1022
01:16:10,920 --> 01:16:15,914
and sent the rabbit scuttling
to where I was stationed.

1024
01:16:40,240 --> 01:16:45,109
how much more satisfying
a recently alive rabbit tastes.

1025
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:51,150
I'm afraid the masters fail
to appreciate fur, guts and bones

1026
01:16:51,240 --> 01:16:53,549
for the delicacies that they are.

1027
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:59,477
Then it was time to quench our thirst.

1028
01:17:05,680 --> 01:17:10,435
And then, as in all things
that befell us on that glorious day,

1029
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:14,433
we came across some water
that had gathered in a hollow.

1030
01:17:17,280 --> 01:17:19,396
Then, after we drank our fill,

1031
01:17:19,480 --> 01:17:23,632
we rolled in it
to give ourselves a good glow

1032
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:28,271
and then we went into the woods
to rest in the shade.

1033
01:17:31,480 --> 01:17:33,596
- Perhaps we should take our...
- Father.

1034
01:17:33,680 --> 01:17:35,910
Be quiet and sit down, please.

1035
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:45,915
You went into the woods and...

1036
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:49,631
And we slept.

1037
01:17:49,720 --> 01:17:53,076
That most sublime of states,

1038
01:17:53,160 --> 01:17:57,278
when a dream dreams you
rather than the other way round.

1039
01:18:17,720 --> 01:18:21,554
And when we awoke, the moon was rising.

1040
01:18:21,640 --> 01:18:26,077
it was just on the other side of the woods,
so we set about surprising it.

1041
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,555
And we came very close to catching it,
for it was slow to get up.

1042
01:18:41,640 --> 01:18:43,915
But just when we were almost on it,

1043
01:18:44,000 --> 01:18:47,675
my friend couldn't control himself
any Ionger and Iet out a cry.

1044
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,795
And had we been there
but a moment sooner,

1045
01:18:56,880 --> 01:18:59,872
we surely would have seized it
and torn it apart Iike the rabbit.

1046
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:04,317
How it would have tasted, I cannot tell.

1047
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:09,872
So we told it what a great
cowardly, unsmelling thing it was

1048
01:19:09,960 --> 01:19:14,636
and if we ever caught up with it,
it would surely regret it.

1049
01:19:19,560 --> 01:19:23,075
Then we turned around and went home.

1050
01:19:24,600 --> 01:19:26,670
So you knew the way home?.

1051
01:19:26,760 --> 01:19:30,753
Oh, yes. Turn towards home and go there.

1052
01:19:32,800 --> 01:19:37,112
But you had been out all day, running free.
How far from home were you?.

1053
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:43,036
Yes, we'd gone many overs, that is true.
How many, I couldn't tell.

1054
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:44,917
Overs?.

1055
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:50,438
Overs. Many overs. Over woods and
fields, streams and hills. Many overs.

1056
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:57,113
And you just... turned towards home?.

1057
01:19:58,600 --> 01:20:01,990
- How else would one do it?.
- Then why...

1058
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:05,709
And I knew that I should be beaten

1059
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:09,588
and I remembered my friend's complaint
that I would use

1060
01:20:09,680 --> 01:20:12,911
and how delicious it would feel

1061
01:20:13,000 --> 01:20:17,232
when the beating had stopped
and the insults had finished.

1062
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:23,075
Yes, the glow of having paid the price
for wrongdoing.

1063
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:28,111
And were you punished?.

1064
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:31,635
No, not on that occasion.

1065
01:20:32,920 --> 01:20:35,673
Why was that?. Do you know?.

1066
01:20:38,160 --> 01:20:42,472
Because a very remarkable thing
happened on the way back...

1067
01:20:54,560 --> 01:20:57,518
which I cannot fully explain.

1068
01:20:57,600 --> 01:21:02,071
One moment we were running along
side by side, heading for home, and the next...

1069
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,520
we were not.

1070
01:21:35,160 --> 01:21:37,720
I cannot say what happened.

1071
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,279
Perhaps it was a dream
and I wakened from it.

1073
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:09,431
Was there any pain?.

1074
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:15,473
Pain?. No, I cannot say there was.

1075
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:25,394
All i can remember
is how clear the night was,

1076
01:22:25,480 --> 01:22:27,471
with the moon-cast shadows

1077
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:32,194
and the earth rising underneath me,

1078
01:22:32,280 --> 01:22:35,158
and home in my heart
and the Master waiting.

1079
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:40,079
But no, no pain.

1080
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:19,113
I am most glad to hear it.

1081
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,712
If you will excuse me.

1082
01:23:30,120 --> 01:23:32,156
Did I say something to upset you, sir?.

1083
01:23:32,240 --> 01:23:35,277
No, no, no, not at all.

1084
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,676
I am put in memory of my son Harrington.

1085
01:23:43,480 --> 01:23:45,516
That is all.

1086
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:00,438
Erm...

1087
01:24:03,320 --> 01:24:06,596
Harrington was, erm...
killed in the Boer War...

1088
01:24:08,920 --> 01:24:11,070
returning from a patrol.

1089
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:13,116
That's all we know.

1090
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,353
The, erm... body was never recovered.

1091
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:52,317
Are you all right, Mr Fisk?.

1092
01:24:58,480 --> 01:25:00,755
He was shot.

1093
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,596
Yes.

1095
01:25:11,720 --> 01:25:15,235
Oh. There, there.

1096
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:23,395
Better Iate than never, Mr Fisk.

1097
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:29,237
Come with me.

1098
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:35,756
In you go, Mr Fisk.

1099
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:43,071
Sit yourself down.

1100
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:52,318
He does mither on, that dean of yours.

1101
01:26:10,520 --> 01:26:13,080
I do hope whatever I said
did not upset him.

1102
01:26:13,160 --> 01:26:18,234
Excuse me. I was talking
to Mrs Brimley about the old days.

1103
01:26:18,320 --> 01:26:21,790
Thank you, Dean, for coming.
It was a memorable evening.

1104
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,598
No, thank you, sir.

1105
01:26:23,680 --> 01:26:27,070
I fear the Tokay
rendered me somewhat unsociable.

1106
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:30,709
It has a tendency
to make me withdraw into myself.

1107
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:35,430
Not at all. You were all
that could be hoped for in a guest.

1108
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,034
You know your way home from here?.

1109
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:42,398
Just turn towards it
is the best way, I'm told.

1110
01:26:42,480 --> 01:26:46,837
I'm going in the dean's direction.
I'II see that he gets there this time.

1111
01:26:46,920 --> 01:26:49,957
- Good of you to come, Mr Wrather.
- Wouldn't have missed it for the world.

1112
01:26:50,040 --> 01:26:52,110
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1113
01:27:04,160 --> 01:27:06,196
You know, Mr Wrather,

1114
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:10,751
I have the most persistent notion
that we have met before.

1115
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:16,551
One often feels that about colonials,
Dean.

1116
01:27:16,640 --> 01:27:20,599
Yes, I have heard that said.
Nevertheless...

1117
01:27:20,680 --> 01:27:25,913
You're not in the market for a new rug,
are you?. I've this good friend in Marrakesh.

1118
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:27,911
Marrakesh?.

1119
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,594
Colourful, exciting place,
if you know the right people.

1120
01:27:30,680 --> 01:27:34,958
- I know the right people.
- Something of an adventure, I imagine.

1121
01:27:41,040 --> 01:27:44,350
He can put away the Tokay,
I'II say that for the dean.

1122
01:27:44,440 --> 01:27:47,716
I thought for a moment
we might have had to open the third bottle.

1123
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:49,916
Oh, two was ample, I think.

1124
01:27:50,000 --> 01:27:52,958
He goes on a bit
when he's in his cups, though.

1125
01:27:55,080 --> 01:27:57,071
Thank you, Father.

1126
01:28:01,240 --> 01:28:05,074
One moment you are running along,
the next you are no more.

1127
01:28:08,640 --> 01:28:11,029
Well...

1128
01:28:30,520 --> 01:28:34,638
- I will see you next Thursday.
- Or any day that suits.

1129
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:37,678
Mustn't get too set in our ways.

1130
01:28:39,400 --> 01:28:41,391
Good night, Henslowe.

1131
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:45,591
Good night, Father.

1132
01:28:56,760 --> 01:28:58,876
God knows
what they were on about.

1133
01:28:58,960 --> 01:29:02,748
Something about rabbits tasting better
with their fur on.

1134
01:29:02,840 --> 01:29:05,752
You won't catch me cooking them,
that's all I can tell you.

1136
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:13,637
Then, he comes in here.

1137
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:17,630
First time in God knows how Iong.

1138
01:29:19,240 --> 01:29:23,552
And he stands...
Iooking at that photograph,

1139
01:29:25,080 --> 01:29:27,071
sobbing his heart out.

1140
01:29:44,960 --> 01:29:46,916
Morning, Mrs Brimley.

1141
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:49,673
- It's not Thursday, you know.
- No, I know.

1142
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:56,158
- How's Father?.
- Well, I don't know, really.

1143
01:29:56,240 --> 01:29:58,470
Here, boy!

1144
01:29:58,560 --> 01:30:00,790
Wasn't my idea, you know.

1145
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:03,189
The day after that dinner,

1146
01:30:03,280 --> 01:30:07,034
he sent me round to see
that friend of yours, the one who was here.

1147
01:30:07,880 --> 01:30:10,838
- Mr Wrather?.
- Sent me round with a Ietter, he did.

1148
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,957
Next day he shows up with a dog.

1149
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:20,239
- What kind of dog?.
- Oh, one of those, erm...

1150
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,629
- Oh, Iike before.
- A spaniel?.

1151
01:30:22,720 --> 01:30:24,711
Must be one of the seven.

1152
01:30:24,800 --> 01:30:26,438
CIever boy!

1153
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:29,398
One's quite enough
in this house, thank you very much.

1154
01:30:29,480 --> 01:30:32,517
It's already chewed a cushion.

1155
01:30:32,600 --> 01:30:34,830
He's in the garden.

1156
01:30:36,080 --> 01:30:42,269
Imagine, Mr Fisk in the garden.
He'II be growing roses next.

1157
01:30:49,440 --> 01:30:51,192
Twist!

1159
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:16,353
That was the end of my talks
with Dean Spanley,

1160
01:31:17,960 --> 01:31:20,235
although my father
sometimes saw him at the club.

1161
01:31:22,080 --> 01:31:24,992
Don 't know what they talked about,
if anything.

1162
01:31:26,280 --> 01:31:31,400
As for the question of reincarnation,
i resolved to wait and see,

1163
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:35,439
albeit with more anticipation
than hitherto.

1164
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:39,797
And should i find myself
in the form of a dog,

1165
01:31:39,880 --> 01:31:41,871
i trust i will be so fortunate

1166
01:31:41,960 --> 01:31:47,239
as to belong to a master
as kind as my father.
