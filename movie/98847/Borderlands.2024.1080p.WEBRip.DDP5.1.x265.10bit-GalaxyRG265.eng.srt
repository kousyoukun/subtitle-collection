1
00:00:46,598 --> 00:00:49,533
Long ago,
our galaxy was ruled

2
00:00:49,635 --> 00:00:52,808
by an alien race
called the Eridians

3
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,636
whose power and technology

4
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,707
were far beyond
human comprehension.

5
00:01:01,382 --> 00:01:03,813
Though they disappeared
ages ago,

6
00:01:03,915 --> 00:01:07,253
they left behind fragments
of their technology,

7
00:01:07,355 --> 00:01:09,957
scraps that became
the foundation

8
00:01:10,059 --> 00:01:11,524
for all human advancement.

9
00:01:13,394 --> 00:01:15,764
But the Eridians'
greatest secrets

10
00:01:15,866 --> 00:01:17,899
were hidden in a vault

11
00:01:18,001 --> 00:01:20,203
located on the planet Pandora.

12
00:01:22,164 --> 00:01:27,268
The once peaceful world
was overrun by corporations,

13
00:01:27,370 --> 00:01:28,772
criminals,

14
00:01:28,874 --> 00:01:30,739
- and treasure seekers...
-Guns, guns, guns!

15
00:01:30,842 --> 00:01:32,672
...fighting
and killing one another

16
00:01:32,774 --> 00:01:34,316
for a chance to find the vault.

17
00:01:37,921 --> 00:01:40,421
But it remained hidden.

18
00:01:42,753 --> 00:01:45,962
Then, amidst
the clouds of chaos,

19
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,989
a glimmer of hope
shone through.

20
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:50,233
A prophecy.

21
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:52,266
That one day,

22
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:55,698
a daughter of Eridia
would open the vault

23
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:58,802
and restore order
to the broken planet.

24
00:02:01,073 --> 00:02:02,441
Yeah.

25
00:02:02,543 --> 00:02:05,212
That sounds like
some wacko B.S., right?

26
00:02:05,314 --> 00:02:07,184
Well, I thought so too,
until...

27
00:02:08,614 --> 00:02:09,912
this mess happened.

28
00:02:14,892 --> 00:02:15,657
There he is!

29
00:02:15,759 --> 00:02:16,754
Stop!

30
00:02:33,437 --> 00:02:34,910
God damn!

31
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:36,879
There's no air holes in there.

32
00:02:36,981 --> 00:02:39,183
What a stupid helmet.

33
00:02:40,145 --> 00:02:41,516
Tina.

34
00:02:41,618 --> 00:02:42,615
Hey.

35
00:02:45,591 --> 00:02:46,856
I'm Roland.

36
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,351
Yeah. There's been some, uh...

37
00:02:48,453 --> 00:02:49,721
There's been some trouble.

38
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:51,895
And Atlas,

39
00:02:51,997 --> 00:02:53,461
he sent me
to bring you to safety.

40
00:02:55,264 --> 00:02:56,931
- My dad sent you?
- That's right.

41
00:02:57,033 --> 00:02:58,427
His shortest soldier?

42
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:00,035
Yeah, his shortest soldier

43
00:03:00,137 --> 00:03:02,163
to save his least
funny daughter.

44
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:03,939
Code three security breach.

45
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,734
The station is in lockdown.

46
00:03:05,836 --> 00:03:07,943
All personnel
must shelter in place.

47
00:03:08,046 --> 00:03:10,245
- Okay, let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey!

48
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:12,078
- Let's slow down.
-Target in sight!

49
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:20,983
Come on. Come on.

50
00:03:21,858 --> 00:03:22,592
Stop!

51
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:25,262
Stay down!

52
00:03:29,691 --> 00:03:31,560
- Oh, God.
- No, no!

53
00:03:31,662 --> 00:03:32,896
Catch.

54
00:03:36,139 --> 00:03:37,397
Fake stormtrooper-ass bitch.

55
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,702
Come here.

56
00:03:38,805 --> 00:03:39,566
Code three security breach.

57
00:03:39,668 --> 00:03:40,635
Come on. Come on.

58
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:42,035
The station is now in lockdown.

59
00:03:42,138 --> 00:03:43,779
Wait, I changed my mind.
Take me back to my cell.

60
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:45,546
- Please.
- Come on.

61
00:03:49,046 --> 00:03:51,086
Holy shit!
One of the Psychos got out.

62
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:52,920
It's time to go insane!

63
00:03:56,018 --> 00:03:58,719
You're in my spot.

64
00:03:58,821 --> 00:04:00,596
Put him down. Put him down.

65
00:04:05,994 --> 00:04:07,568
Hey, easy.

66
00:04:08,202 --> 00:04:09,468
What do you, uh...

67
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,703
What do you say
me and you be friends?

68
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,674
Shit.

69
00:04:13,943 --> 00:04:15,312
Sorry, Knoxx.

70
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:18,546
My girl.

71
00:04:22,945 --> 00:04:23,952
Krieg,
what's up, man?

72
00:04:24,054 --> 00:04:24,783
You want some pancakes?

73
00:04:25,858 --> 00:04:27,923
My girl broken.

74
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,326
It's Krieg, right?

75
00:04:30,588 --> 00:04:32,087
Yeah.

76
00:04:33,926 --> 00:04:35,596
What do you say you help me
get her outta here?

77
00:04:37,135 --> 00:04:39,335
Yeah.

78
00:04:47,912 --> 00:04:49,278
Of course,

79
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:51,147
we can't all be
the daughter of Eridia,

80
00:04:51,249 --> 00:04:54,008
skipping down
the path of destiny.

81
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,044
Some of us
have to work for a living.

82
00:04:57,147 --> 00:04:58,646
You don't have
to do this, you know.

83
00:04:58,748 --> 00:05:01,017
I mean, I can pay you.

84
00:05:01,119 --> 00:05:03,659
Yeah, whatever's in my wallet
right now, it's yours.

85
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:05,184
Okay?

86
00:05:05,287 --> 00:05:07,723
Shut up
or I'll break your other arm.

87
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:08,863
Oh, no,
one arm's good.

88
00:05:08,965 --> 00:05:10,191
That's fine.

89
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:22,775
-'Sup?
- Sorry.

90
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:29,184
- Quinn.
- Lilith.

91
00:05:29,286 --> 00:05:31,188
We do have other seats,
you know.

92
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,884
Then he won't have
any trouble finding one.

93
00:05:34,023 --> 00:05:35,024
Uh, not tonight.

94
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:36,758
Top shelf.

95
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:41,021
Not sure how top
you think the shelves are.

96
00:05:41,123 --> 00:05:43,697
Eh, buy your kid
some dance lessons.

97
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:47,228
Hot date?

98
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,665
You remember that heist down
in Lectra City last month?

99
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,231
Yeah, a couple of guards died.

100
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:53,374
Yeah, well, this sad sack
was the trigger man.

101
00:05:53,476 --> 00:05:54,536
Listen, I never meant
to shoot anyone.

102
00:05:54,638 --> 00:05:56,740
I was...

103
00:05:56,842 --> 00:05:58,481
I'm getting too old
for this shit.

104
00:06:00,182 --> 00:06:01,680
Bounty hunting? Uh.

105
00:06:01,782 --> 00:06:04,080
It's for the young and stupid.
Am I right?

106
00:06:05,388 --> 00:06:06,788
You really want me
to answer that?

107
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:07,789
I do not.

108
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:08,887
Lilith.

109
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:12,559
Piss off.

110
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:15,027
I heard you were quite
the crusty old...

111
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:19,896
Wait. Wait, wait.

112
00:06:19,998 --> 00:06:22,934
We, uh, maybe got off
on the wrong foot.

113
00:06:23,974 --> 00:06:25,200
You see, um...

114
00:06:27,904 --> 00:06:30,739
I represent a very wealthy man

115
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:32,815
who has a contract for you.

116
00:06:32,917 --> 00:06:34,081
I've got a job.

117
00:06:34,183 --> 00:06:35,579
Maybe next month.

118
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:37,217
You collect on that scum

119
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,151
dead or alive, right?

120
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:41,155
Hey.

121
00:06:41,257 --> 00:06:42,118
Not in here, big boy.

122
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:45,056
We don't want any trouble.

123
00:06:45,158 --> 00:06:49,061
It's just, uh, our employer
is, uh, not one for waiting.

124
00:06:49,163 --> 00:06:50,192
Who is?

125
00:07:06,778 --> 00:07:09,186
Are you with these assholes?

126
00:07:09,288 --> 00:07:10,953
Or are you just a fan
of violence?

127
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:12,616
These gentlemen work

128
00:07:12,718 --> 00:07:15,789
or should I say "worked" for me?

129
00:07:19,695 --> 00:07:20,926
I'll get Kimber
to clean this up.

130
00:07:21,757 --> 00:07:22,598
Thanks, Quinn.

131
00:07:27,429 --> 00:07:29,801
That was impressive.

132
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:32,702
I warned them
not to underestimate you.

133
00:07:32,804 --> 00:07:35,273
My name is Deukalian Atlas.

134
00:07:35,375 --> 00:07:36,977
And, uh...

135
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:38,014
Hold on.

136
00:07:38,116 --> 00:07:39,840
This is...

137
00:07:39,942 --> 00:07:41,885
This is rather awkward.

138
00:07:41,987 --> 00:07:43,346
Hey, you there.

139
00:07:43,449 --> 00:07:44,678
Fat boy.

140
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,280
Put me on.

141
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:50,626
But she just
killed Frank and Wes.

142
00:07:50,728 --> 00:07:53,321
But she would never
shoot a man of your caliber.

143
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,763
Mm.

144
00:08:05,439 --> 00:08:06,702
As I was saying...

145
00:08:06,804 --> 00:08:08,401
Start walking.

146
00:08:08,503 --> 00:08:10,145
My name is Deukalian Atlas.

147
00:08:10,247 --> 00:08:11,212
President of the...

148
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:12,978
The Atlas Corporation?

149
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:16,012
Clue's in the name.

150
00:08:16,114 --> 00:08:19,054
Look, uh, this has been
a really long day.

151
00:08:19,156 --> 00:08:21,256
Can we just skip to,

152
00:08:21,358 --> 00:08:23,025
I don't know, whatever this is?

153
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:24,358
Of course.

154
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:26,360
My daughter has been kidnapped,

155
00:08:26,462 --> 00:08:27,823
and I need her returned to me.

156
00:08:27,925 --> 00:08:31,160
Bounty hunter, not babysitter.

157
00:08:31,262 --> 00:08:33,828
Haven't you got some
toy soldiers you can send?

158
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,396
Yes, the Crimson Lance.

159
00:08:36,498 --> 00:08:38,866
Unfortunately, the kidnapper
is one of them.

160
00:08:38,968 --> 00:08:40,707
I need an outsider.

161
00:08:40,809 --> 00:08:42,511
Someone who knows
how to handle a planet

162
00:08:42,614 --> 00:08:44,708
full of Psychos, skags,
and vault hunters

163
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,281
like they were born there.

164
00:08:46,383 --> 00:08:49,383
Your daughter's on Pandora?

165
00:08:49,485 --> 00:08:51,451
Thoughts and prayers.

166
00:08:51,553 --> 00:08:52,619
But you couldn't pay me enough

167
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:54,288
to set foot
on that shithole again.

168
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:56,023
Are you sure about that?

169
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,719
Oh.

170
00:08:58,821 --> 00:09:00,529
Maybe you could.

171
00:09:00,632 --> 00:09:03,391
Okay, I'll start
when my current contract ends.

172
00:09:08,696 --> 00:09:10,068
Seems like you're free
to start immediately.

173
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,171
Give her the beacon.

174
00:09:17,176 --> 00:09:19,415
Activate this device
when you find my daughter

175
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,550
and my people
will retrieve her.

176
00:09:21,652 --> 00:09:24,385
You haven't disappointed
so far, Lilith.

177
00:09:24,487 --> 00:09:26,282
I advise you not to start.

178
00:09:28,158 --> 00:09:29,021
Sorry.

179
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:35,390
Oh, shit.

180
00:09:54,183 --> 00:09:57,486
Thank you for
flying Atlas transport pods.

181
00:09:57,588 --> 00:09:59,117
You've arrived
at your destination.

182
00:09:59,882 --> 00:10:01,350
Pandora.

183
00:10:01,452 --> 00:10:03,355
Let me tell you
everything you need to know

184
00:10:03,457 --> 00:10:04,727
about Pandora.

185
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,860
It's a shithole.

186
00:10:10,963 --> 00:10:12,795
I should know. I'm from here.

187
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:14,594
God, I hate this planet.

188
00:10:15,273 --> 00:10:17,163
It's the kind of place

189
00:10:17,265 --> 00:10:19,599
you don't ever wanna return to.

190
00:10:21,104 --> 00:10:24,305
So, the sooner I find the girl,

191
00:10:24,408 --> 00:10:27,277
the sooner I can
get the hell outta here.

192
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:32,719
The soldier had hijacked
one of Atlas' shuttles

193
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:35,324
and crash-landed here
months ago.

194
00:10:35,427 --> 00:10:37,183
There wasn't much left of it.

195
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:38,527
It'd been stripped for parts

196
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:42,291
and vandalized
by vault hunters.

197
00:10:42,393 --> 00:10:45,224
No way to know
if he and Tina even survived.

198
00:10:45,326 --> 00:10:47,294
Wanna know if you've seen her.

199
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,803
But then I spoke
to some locals.

200
00:10:48,905 --> 00:10:52,871
Scavenger kids
barely scraping out a living.

201
00:10:52,973 --> 00:10:54,541
They told me
Tina and the soldier

202
00:10:54,643 --> 00:10:55,874
had passed through weeks ago

203
00:10:55,976 --> 00:10:58,646
heading north
towards Fyrestone.

204
00:10:58,748 --> 00:11:01,083
Then I ran
into some other locals.

205
00:11:01,185 --> 00:11:02,551
Run!

206
00:11:02,653 --> 00:11:04,787
Psychos.
Murderous gangs.

207
00:11:14,623 --> 00:11:16,563
It was time to catch a ride
and head north.

208
00:11:20,437 --> 00:11:22,236
Hello, vault hunter.

209
00:11:22,338 --> 00:11:23,429
Need a ride?

210
00:11:23,531 --> 00:11:24,899
Yeah, I'm not
a vault hunter, but...

211
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,573
Then welcome aboard.

212
00:11:26,675 --> 00:11:28,610
People inside, bags up top.

213
00:11:28,712 --> 00:11:30,877
Don't need
any explosives going pop.

214
00:11:30,979 --> 00:11:33,381
That is a mess to clean up,
believe me.

215
00:11:40,324 --> 00:11:42,554
Hello, passenger.

216
00:11:42,656 --> 00:11:44,156
My name is Marcus.

217
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,054
But of course,

218
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,364
you're not here for small talk.

219
00:11:48,466 --> 00:11:51,201
You are here to find the vault.

220
00:11:51,303 --> 00:11:52,267
Uh, you can stop there.

221
00:11:52,369 --> 00:11:53,367
Not a vault hunter.

222
00:11:53,469 --> 00:11:54,336
Just need a ride.

223
00:11:54,438 --> 00:11:56,438
If you say so.

224
00:12:01,206 --> 00:12:04,446
Well, hello,
brave vault hunter.

225
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:06,781
So, you've come in search

226
00:12:06,884 --> 00:12:09,945
of the secret lost vault
of the Eridians,

227
00:12:10,047 --> 00:12:13,746
right here on Pandora!

228
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:16,623
Do you want to be rich
beyond your wildest dreams?

229
00:12:16,725 --> 00:12:18,552
First, you must find the keys,

230
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,463
then the vault itself,
but it won't be easy.

231
00:12:21,565 --> 00:12:23,397
Could you turn this shit off?

232
00:12:23,499 --> 00:12:24,462
Not a vault hunter.

233
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:26,065
No can do.

234
00:12:26,167 --> 00:12:29,267
This bus is for transporting
vault hunters, so...

235
00:12:29,369 --> 00:12:32,403
Will you be
the one to find the vault?

236
00:12:32,505 --> 00:12:36,269
Ancient alien treasure filled
with high-tech secrets...

237
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:38,238
Pandora is a dangerous place,

238
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,509
so you need superior firepower.

239
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:42,649
Prepare yourself
with one of Marcus' munitions.

240
00:12:42,752 --> 00:12:45,278
Next stop, Fyrestone,

241
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,453
where all vault hunters begin.

242
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:48,521
Uh, no.

243
00:12:48,623 --> 00:12:51,253
Really, I am not...

244
00:12:54,099 --> 00:12:54,831
Thanks.

245
00:12:55,730 --> 00:12:57,667
Good luck, vault hunter.

246
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:00,366
I hope you find
what you're searching for.

247
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:58,893
Two weeks on the trail,

248
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:00,963
and it was as cold
as Pandora's moons.

249
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:05,264
Tina and the soldier
were long gone.

250
00:14:05,366 --> 00:14:09,202
I needed a miracle,
but I got something else.

251
00:14:22,853 --> 00:14:25,355
My eye!

252
00:14:25,457 --> 00:14:27,456
You shot me in my eye!

253
00:14:27,558 --> 00:14:28,755
You blinded me for life!

254
00:14:28,857 --> 00:14:30,722
How will I manage to survive?

255
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:32,555
I'm just kidding!

256
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:35,589
I was designed to withstand
all kinds of violent acts,

257
00:14:35,691 --> 00:14:38,534
even completely
unjustified ones like yours.

258
00:14:38,636 --> 00:14:40,129
Now, I bet you're wondering,

259
00:14:40,231 --> 00:14:42,095
what's the deal with this thing?

260
00:14:42,197 --> 00:14:43,263
Uh, no, I'm not.

261
00:14:43,365 --> 00:14:44,697
I'm programmed for humor,

262
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,538
so I will process that
as "witty banter."

263
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:47,609
Beat it.

264
00:14:47,711 --> 00:14:50,638
I'm a Hyperion brand CL4P-TP,

265
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,273
possibly the last of my kind
still in service.

266
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,412
But you can call me...

267
00:14:55,243 --> 00:14:56,445
Whoopsie! Ha!

268
00:14:56,547 --> 00:14:58,546
You accidentally shot me
in the face again.

269
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,387
As I was saying,
you can call me Claptrap.

270
00:15:01,924 --> 00:15:03,457
You know,
I can do this all night,

271
00:15:03,559 --> 00:15:04,760
so piss off.

272
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:05,827
Believe me,
I wish I could

273
00:15:05,929 --> 00:15:07,156
based on what little
I've experienced

274
00:15:07,258 --> 00:15:09,465
of your horrendous personality.

275
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:11,257
But I have no choice.

276
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:12,764
What do you mean?

277
00:15:12,866 --> 00:15:14,270
Did Atlas send you?

278
00:15:14,372 --> 00:15:15,803
Atlas? Yuck!

279
00:15:15,905 --> 00:15:17,269
I don't work
for the competition.

280
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:19,575
No, I've been lying dormant
under a garbage heap

281
00:15:19,677 --> 00:15:21,744
for... calculating... 36 years!

282
00:15:21,846 --> 00:15:23,808
But the moment
you landed on Pandora,

283
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,609
I was reactivated

284
00:15:25,711 --> 00:15:28,276
because I've been programmed
to help you upon your return!

285
00:15:28,378 --> 00:15:29,450
No one knew I was coming here.

286
00:15:29,552 --> 00:15:31,244
Not even me.

287
00:15:31,346 --> 00:15:32,420
Who programmed you?

288
00:15:32,522 --> 00:15:33,956
I don't know!

289
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:35,781
Which is a shame,
because you're an awful person

290
00:15:35,883 --> 00:15:37,817
and I'd love to know
who to blame for this.

291
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:40,286
Since I don't, I have
no choice but to serve you

292
00:15:40,388 --> 00:15:41,962
until you're dead.

293
00:15:42,064 --> 00:15:43,930
Did that sound like a threat?
Sorry.

294
00:15:44,032 --> 00:15:46,359
Anyway, as long as
you're not dead,

295
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:47,635
- I'm here to help.
- Oh.

296
00:15:47,737 --> 00:15:49,271
And I have many skills.

297
00:15:49,374 --> 00:15:51,165
Balancing.

298
00:15:51,267 --> 00:15:52,541
Turning in circles.

299
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:54,271
I don't need a partner.

300
00:15:54,373 --> 00:15:56,545
Uh, I can also access
the ECHOnet.

301
00:15:56,647 --> 00:15:58,713
Did you say "ECHOnet"?

302
00:15:58,815 --> 00:16:00,276
Can you use it to find someone?

303
00:16:00,378 --> 00:16:01,813
Of course.
Just show me a picture.

304
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:03,313
I'll hack and search

305
00:16:03,415 --> 00:16:05,184
its slowly dying
visual banks for matches

306
00:16:05,286 --> 00:16:07,388
and find your target's
last known location.

307
00:16:07,491 --> 00:16:08,648
Find her.

308
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,558
She was last seen
outside Fyrestone.

309
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,555
Accessing network.

Your target was last recorded

319
00:16:29,509 --> 00:16:31,745
near an abandoned quarry
in the Tundra Express!

320
00:16:31,847 --> 00:16:33,983
It's only 132 days on foot

321
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:36,881
with a 98% chance of being
eaten by a Craw maggot!

322
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:39,314
I like those odds!

323
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:40,650
We're gonna need some wheels.

324
00:16:43,094 --> 00:16:46,254
That's the Crimson Lance,
Atlas' private army.

325
00:16:46,356 --> 00:16:47,695
What are they doing here?

326
00:16:47,797 --> 00:16:49,689
Oh, just a guess here.

327
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:52,530
Exactly the same thing
you're doing.

328
00:16:52,632 --> 00:16:55,564
And the Lance
teaming up with the Psychos?

329
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,104
It seems like Atlas will hire

330
00:16:57,206 --> 00:16:59,039
just about anyone
to find his daughter.

331
00:16:59,141 --> 00:17:01,473
Concentrating.
Sorry.

332
00:17:04,672 --> 00:17:06,407
Huh. The Lance are leaving.

333
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:07,882
I guess they didn't find her.

334
00:17:07,984 --> 00:17:09,750
No more Mommy!

335
00:17:09,852 --> 00:17:11,978
Free lunch! Hot delivery!

336
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:16,191
Huh?

337
00:17:24,532 --> 00:17:27,262
That was so out of character
to save those children.

338
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:28,702
Well, I needed a ride.

339
00:17:28,804 --> 00:17:30,104
For a second there,

340
00:17:30,206 --> 00:17:32,104
I thought you weren't
a horrible person.

341
00:17:32,206 --> 00:17:34,735
Phew! The world
makes sense again.

342
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:36,478
Now, there's only room
for one up front,

343
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:37,778
but worry not.

344
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,676
I can sit on your lap.

345
00:17:42,387 --> 00:17:43,446
Lilith!

346
00:17:43,548 --> 00:17:45,748
You accidentally locked me
in the back!

347
00:17:46,556 --> 00:17:48,619
Lilith!

348
00:18:17,755 --> 00:18:19,787
Please drain my battery.

349
00:18:19,889 --> 00:18:20,918
Put me back to sleep.

350
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:22,692
I won't tell.

351
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:23,924
You said you wanted to help.

352
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:25,653
I said I'm programmed to help.

353
00:18:25,755 --> 00:18:27,762
What I want to do
is wipe my memory,

354
00:18:27,864 --> 00:18:29,790
you horrendous she-devil.

355
00:18:29,893 --> 00:18:31,959
Are you sure these
are the right coordinates?

356
00:18:32,061 --> 00:18:34,636
Yes. This is the last known
location of your quarry.

357
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,369
Get it?

358
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,834
But it looks like
she's long gone by now.

359
00:18:41,974 --> 00:18:43,069
Does it?

360
00:19:14,410 --> 00:19:16,773
You know, it's quite
a menagerie you've got here.

361
00:19:18,247 --> 00:19:21,976
You could start
your own Pandoran zoo.

362
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:30,116
You must be Tina.

363
00:19:33,829 --> 00:19:34,857
Name's Lilith.

364
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,730
So, that soldier...

365
00:19:40,805 --> 00:19:41,762
who brought you here,

366
00:19:41,864 --> 00:19:43,063
is he playing
hide-and-seek, too?

367
00:19:43,806 --> 00:19:45,533
He left me.

368
00:19:45,635 --> 00:19:46,902
I haven't seen him in days.

369
00:19:48,044 --> 00:19:49,842
Well, I'm here to take you home

370
00:19:49,944 --> 00:19:52,378
to your father.

371
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,410
Yeah, he seems like
a real, uh, sweetheart.

372
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:56,950
What? My daddy?

373
00:19:57,052 --> 00:19:58,883
I get to see my daddy?

374
00:19:58,985 --> 00:20:00,381
Really?

375
00:20:00,483 --> 00:20:01,584
I've been so afraid.

376
00:20:01,686 --> 00:20:02,857
- Yeah.
-I've been scared.

377
00:20:02,959 --> 00:20:04,293
Speaking of your daddy...

378
00:20:04,395 --> 00:20:05,690
The noises outside
really freaked me out.

379
00:20:05,792 --> 00:20:07,052
I've just gotta let him know
that I got you safe...

380
00:20:07,154 --> 00:20:08,025
I should probably
get my stuff.

381
00:20:08,127 --> 00:20:09,096
Shit.

382
00:20:09,198 --> 00:20:11,957
I really love my daddy.

383
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,796
He's such a nurturing
parental figure.

384
00:20:14,898 --> 00:20:16,668
Sure, I'll have to take
your word for it.

385
00:20:21,536 --> 00:20:22,768
Miss Lilith,

386
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,874
can you grab my Badonkadonk?

387
00:20:26,079 --> 00:20:27,514
Your what now?

388
00:20:36,089 --> 00:20:37,458
You little...

389
00:20:43,895 --> 00:20:46,769
I love it
when bounty hunters drop by.

390
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:48,595
Time to make it rain...

391
00:20:48,697 --> 00:20:49,771
with your body parts.

392
00:20:59,574 --> 00:21:01,114
Hey.

393
00:21:01,216 --> 00:21:02,912
You still alive down there?

394
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:08,781
She seems deranged.

395
00:21:08,883 --> 00:21:10,458
You two have a lot in common.

396
00:21:13,197 --> 00:21:14,792
Only she's smaller,
nicer, cuter.

397
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,830
Hope that wasn't
something important.

398
00:21:17,933 --> 00:21:19,662
Fix this.

399
00:21:19,764 --> 00:21:21,664
Because, whoo, it's toast.

400
00:21:23,897 --> 00:21:25,165
Where'd you go?

401
00:21:26,205 --> 00:21:27,167
Tina.

402
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:31,939
Look, I... I'm here to save you.

403
00:21:32,041 --> 00:21:33,848
Do I look like
I need saving?

404
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:35,711
'Cause I'm up here

405
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:37,543
and you're all hiding
under a car.

406
00:21:37,645 --> 00:21:38,844
Like a bitch!

407
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:40,879
You get down here right now.

408
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:43,793
Oh, Krieg!

409
00:21:47,590 --> 00:21:49,461
This fancy-ass woman

410
00:21:49,563 --> 00:21:51,664
just pointed a gun
at your best friend.

411
00:21:53,094 --> 00:21:55,871
I will lick
your spine clean.

412
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:58,006
Holed up with Psychos?

413
00:21:58,108 --> 00:22:01,074
He only used to be a Psycho.

414
00:22:01,176 --> 00:22:03,207
Now he's my big brother!

415
00:22:03,309 --> 00:22:04,875
How sweet.

416
00:22:04,977 --> 00:22:06,209
One of you kill the other,
I'm gonna go get a coffee.

417
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:17,984
Tell her what she's won, Krieg.

418
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,956
You've walked
the wrong dog.

419
00:22:21,824 --> 00:22:23,724
Shoot him in the face.

420
00:22:23,826 --> 00:22:24,730
Shoot him in the face again.

421
00:22:27,668 --> 00:22:29,033
It's not working.
Forget it. Abort. Go!

422
00:22:29,136 --> 00:22:30,197
Run, run!

423
00:22:52,855 --> 00:22:54,762
Mine's bigger.

424
00:22:57,702 --> 00:22:58,434
Listen.

425
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:01,729
I was sent by your father.

426
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:03,403
Well, that's strange.

427
00:23:03,505 --> 00:23:05,103
Because I don't
have a father, lady.

428
00:23:06,641 --> 00:23:08,701
I know this planet
can mess with your mind.

429
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:09,911
My mind is awesome.

430
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:11,809
My mind's so cool.

431
00:23:11,911 --> 00:23:15,073
Listen, I don't wanna be here.
Nothing personal.

432
00:23:15,175 --> 00:23:16,282
So, if you could
just come with me,

433
00:23:16,384 --> 00:23:17,283
and you could talk to your dad

434
00:23:17,385 --> 00:23:18,949
and you guys can sort it out,

435
00:23:19,051 --> 00:23:20,016
family style. And I can...

436
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:30,290
Nice work, lady.
You led 'em straight to me.

437
00:23:30,392 --> 00:23:34,096
So, Atlas sent
someone new to find the girl.

438
00:23:34,198 --> 00:23:37,097
Never would have thought
it was a scumbag vault hunter.

439
00:23:37,199 --> 00:23:39,640
Actually, I'm not
a scumbag vault hunter.

440
00:23:39,742 --> 00:23:42,138
Actually,
she's a scumbag bounty hunter.

441
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,277
You know, it's not
my fault you suck at your job,

442
00:23:44,379 --> 00:23:46,105
whoever you are. Who are you?

443
00:23:46,207 --> 00:23:48,248
Commander Knoxx
of the Crimson Lance.

444
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:49,949
And I'm taking the girl with me.

445
00:23:50,052 --> 00:23:51,183
Oh, yeah?

446
00:23:51,285 --> 00:23:52,312
You and what army?

447
00:23:53,288 --> 00:23:54,754
The one right behind me.

448
00:23:58,689 --> 00:23:59,787
Move, move.

449
00:23:59,889 --> 00:24:01,095
Charlie team, right side.

450
00:24:01,197 --> 00:24:02,762
On your lead, with me!

451
00:24:04,726 --> 00:24:05,692
Stay behind me.

452
00:24:05,794 --> 00:24:07,134
- I'll go.
- Wait.

453
00:24:07,236 --> 00:24:08,864
And if you're both nice,

454
00:24:08,966 --> 00:24:11,232
I'll put in a good word
with Daddy.

455
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:13,168
Sounds good to me.

456
00:24:14,076 --> 00:24:15,706
Sergeant Russo,

457
00:24:15,808 --> 00:24:17,277
bring me a neurocollar
for the girl.

458
00:24:17,379 --> 00:24:18,870
Copy that, Commander.

459
00:24:18,972 --> 00:24:20,940
A collar?

460
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,315
I love new jewelry.

461
00:24:22,417 --> 00:24:24,586
Yeah, I got you a gift, too.

462
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,116
Catch.

463
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,124
Will you be my friend?

464
00:24:30,226 --> 00:24:31,021
Oh, shit!

465
00:24:31,962 --> 00:24:33,188
Yes!

466
00:24:40,466 --> 00:24:41,999
- Come on!
- Hey!

467
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:05,728
Oh, shit!

468
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,892
Tina!

469
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:14,493
Stop.
She's coming with me.

470
00:25:22,545 --> 00:25:24,041
I leave you alone
for 10 minutes...

471
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,839
Get in the car.

472
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,082
It's okay. He's with me.

473
00:25:27,184 --> 00:25:28,248
I wish I wasn't.

474
00:25:28,350 --> 00:25:29,882
Get in the car!

475
00:25:32,054 --> 00:25:33,220
Go, go!

476
00:25:40,528 --> 00:25:42,228
Lilith, wait for me!

477
00:25:42,330 --> 00:25:43,196
What did I tell you?

478
00:25:43,298 --> 00:25:45,232
Minimal explosions.

479
00:25:45,334 --> 00:25:47,102
No, I said no explosions!

480
00:25:47,204 --> 00:25:48,368
Who the hell are you?

481
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,262
This is Lilith. My dad sent her.

482
00:25:50,364 --> 00:25:52,804
Oh. She's a scumbag
bounty hunter.

483
00:25:52,906 --> 00:25:55,367
No, I am a high-end
bounty hunter, pal.

484
00:25:55,469 --> 00:25:56,906
-No.
- And letting kids get shot at

485
00:25:57,008 --> 00:25:58,277
was not part
of my job description.

486
00:25:58,379 --> 00:25:59,412
Oh, I bet it wasn't.

487
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,374
Lilith. Lilith.

488
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,984
You inadvertently left
your best friend behind!

489
00:26:04,086 --> 00:26:05,720
To die!

490
00:26:07,925 --> 00:26:09,053
Lilith!

491
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,600
Move, move, move!

492
00:26:20,394 --> 00:26:21,269
Hey!
No pressure or anything

493
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,065
but I'd love to come inside,

494
00:26:23,168 --> 00:26:24,740
- if you get a chance.
- What are you doing?

495
00:26:24,842 --> 00:26:27,473
Just hoping you can
reach out and scoop me up.

496
00:26:27,575 --> 00:26:28,611
You don't have to stop, just...

497
00:26:29,946 --> 00:26:31,279
Hey!

498
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,906
Go easy on the merchandise.

499
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:34,408
Here they come!

500
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:41,154
All units,
you are now weapons free!

501
00:26:41,256 --> 00:26:42,548
Take them down!

502
00:26:49,893 --> 00:26:51,161
Damn it! You know what?

503
00:26:52,201 --> 00:26:53,295
You drive.

504
00:27:06,547 --> 00:27:07,973
You programmed to steer?

505
00:27:08,075 --> 00:27:08,816
Who, me?

506
00:27:16,052 --> 00:27:17,516
Who's driving the damn truck?

507
00:27:17,618 --> 00:27:19,394
♪ Driving, driving, driving ♪

508
00:27:19,496 --> 00:27:20,592
♪ I'm so good at driving ♪

509
00:27:20,694 --> 00:27:21,954
♪ I'm a robot driver ♪

510
00:27:31,003 --> 00:27:32,398
Locking on target, ma'am.

511
00:27:32,501 --> 00:27:34,138
We got a problem!

512
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,305
Brace for impact!

513
00:27:38,348 --> 00:27:39,479
Holy underwear!

514
00:27:45,488 --> 00:27:47,448
I told you to drive. Damn it.

515
00:27:55,964 --> 00:27:58,734
Bandit one, four,
up on the right. Cut 'em off.

516
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:03,464
They got us pinned.

517
00:28:05,508 --> 00:28:07,707
Not yet they don't. Hold on.

518
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:19,887
- Brace yourselves.
-What are you doing?

519
00:28:33,536 --> 00:28:35,496
That was a terrible idea

520
00:28:36,305 --> 00:28:37,271
but it worked.

521
00:28:37,373 --> 00:28:38,433
Mm, maybe.

522
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:41,073
Where are we?

523
00:28:42,707 --> 00:28:44,175
Pisswash gully.

524
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:49,615
What's that smell? Ugh.

525
00:28:49,717 --> 00:28:51,252
- Put the window up.
- Why?

526
00:28:51,354 --> 00:28:52,486
Put the window up!

527
00:28:52,588 --> 00:28:54,285
What is that smell?

528
00:28:54,387 --> 00:28:55,823
What is this "smell"
thing everyone talks about?

529
00:28:55,925 --> 00:28:57,550
- Listen to what I just said!
- I don't want to!

530
00:28:57,652 --> 00:28:59,126
- Roll the window up!
- Don't tell me what to...

531
00:29:04,059 --> 00:29:05,960
It's in my mouth!

532
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:07,598
Sardine showers.

533
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:09,264
It's pee. It's pee.

534
00:29:09,367 --> 00:29:11,805
Now I got pee
all in the middle of my truck.

535
00:29:11,907 --> 00:29:13,603
Correction.
It's 67% urine...

536
00:29:13,705 --> 00:29:15,267
14% fecal...

537
00:29:25,114 --> 00:29:26,745
- Oh!
-Look out!

538
00:29:30,459 --> 00:29:31,486
Oh, God!

539
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:34,594
Don't nobody move.

540
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:35,426
I'm not about to die in this...

541
00:29:35,528 --> 00:29:36,658
Shut up.

542
00:29:41,138 --> 00:29:42,233
Okay.

543
00:29:43,571 --> 00:29:44,803
Is that...

544
00:29:44,905 --> 00:29:46,131
This don't look so good.

545
00:29:46,233 --> 00:29:46,974
Yes, it is.

546
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:50,538
That thing looks angry!

547
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,144
- Do you wanna press reverse?
-Or hungry.

548
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:55,614
Oh, my God. It's gonna kill us.
It's gonna kill us.

549
00:29:55,716 --> 00:29:56,682
Wait a second.

550
00:29:56,784 --> 00:29:58,280
Do you want me to press reverse?

551
00:29:58,382 --> 00:29:59,353
No, I don't
want you to do nothing!

552
00:30:03,592 --> 00:30:04,827
Oh, my God!

553
00:30:08,829 --> 00:30:10,096
Your friends are back.

554
00:30:14,428 --> 00:30:16,569
Roland, don't be stupid.

555
00:30:16,671 --> 00:30:18,130
Just give us the girl.

556
00:30:20,436 --> 00:30:23,373
Everybody, buckle up.
I got a plan.

557
00:30:25,648 --> 00:30:26,640
Somebody hold me!

558
00:30:28,343 --> 00:30:29,610
Seriously, I have no seat belt!

559
00:30:30,818 --> 00:30:33,185
Roland, what are you doing?

560
00:30:34,625 --> 00:30:36,452
- Go, go, go!
-Hold on!

561
00:30:41,357 --> 00:30:42,392
- Hold it!
-No, no, no!

562
00:30:58,545 --> 00:30:59,678
Shit.

563
00:30:59,780 --> 00:31:00,916
Feels like we blew a tire.

564
00:31:01,683 --> 00:31:03,682
You call that a plan?

565
00:31:03,784 --> 00:31:05,420
It worked, didn't it?

566
00:31:05,522 --> 00:31:06,482
Feel free to applaud.

567
00:31:11,353 --> 00:31:12,756
Yay for not dying!

568
00:31:36,385 --> 00:31:37,117
Nothing.

569
00:31:39,517 --> 00:31:41,723
- You stay here and keep watch.
-Okay.

570
00:31:41,825 --> 00:31:43,656
But it's you
they don't seem to trust.

571
00:31:43,758 --> 00:31:45,620
And who can blame them?

572
00:31:45,722 --> 00:31:48,095
♪ Scanning, scanning, scanning
Scanning ♪

573
00:31:55,903 --> 00:31:58,435
They should be after us by now.

574
00:32:01,705 --> 00:32:04,502
Stingrays won't pursue
without ground support.

575
00:32:04,604 --> 00:32:06,173
Knoxx'll wait on reinforcements.

576
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:07,444
Let it down, big guy.

577
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:11,445
Before you added kidnapping
to your resume

578
00:32:11,547 --> 00:32:13,353
you were an officer
in Crimson Lance.

579
00:32:13,455 --> 00:32:14,789
Right?

580
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,152
Roland didn't kidnap me.
He saved me.

581
00:32:17,254 --> 00:32:18,625
Saved you from what?

582
00:32:18,727 --> 00:32:20,323
A life of ease and plenty?

583
00:32:20,425 --> 00:32:22,464
My daddy thinks
I'm the daughter of Eridia.

584
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,190
I can open the vault.

585
00:32:24,292 --> 00:32:25,292
The vault?

586
00:32:25,394 --> 00:32:27,002
That's what this shit is about?

587
00:32:28,595 --> 00:32:30,333
You stole her for yourself.

588
00:32:30,435 --> 00:32:33,335
Now, do you know
how many people have died

589
00:32:33,437 --> 00:32:34,342
looking for that hole
in the dirt?

590
00:32:34,444 --> 00:32:36,170
Well, I do.

591
00:32:36,272 --> 00:32:37,604
My mother was one of them.

592
00:32:37,706 --> 00:32:39,680
We have something they don't,
baby girl.

593
00:32:39,782 --> 00:32:41,178
Oh, let me guess. What? Spirit?

594
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:43,150
Can-do attitude?
The power of friendship?

595
00:32:44,553 --> 00:32:45,482
A conscience.

596
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:47,647
Whatever's in that vault,

597
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:48,857
a man like Atlas
can never get his hands on it.

598
00:32:48,959 --> 00:32:50,322
- All right, Roland, calm down.
-No!

599
00:32:50,424 --> 00:32:52,688
She's a scumbag bounty hunter
who works for Atlas.

600
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:55,220
What, and you think your band
of merry heroes can stop him?

601
00:32:55,322 --> 00:32:56,524
Oh, we can try.

602
00:32:56,627 --> 00:32:58,393
We just can't watch our backs
while doing it.

603
00:32:58,495 --> 00:33:00,358
So, do me a favor.
Take your weapon.

604
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:01,801
Toss it over here.

605
00:33:01,903 --> 00:33:03,567
Grab some supplies, take a walk.

606
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:07,167
You know, when Atlas finds out
about that party back there,

607
00:33:07,269 --> 00:33:08,439
I'm as good as dead.

608
00:33:09,338 --> 00:33:10,441
So, like it or not...

609
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,872
we're on the same side.

610
00:33:22,156 --> 00:33:25,420
A side without an army,
I might add.

611
00:33:25,522 --> 00:33:28,257
So, I hope
you got a better plan than

612
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:30,296
driving down
a thresher's gullet.

613
00:33:31,433 --> 00:33:32,700
No.

614
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:33,662
But I know someone who does.

615
00:33:34,705 --> 00:33:36,896
A scientist, a vault expert.

616
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:39,905
It was her idea to break
Tina out and collect the keys.

617
00:33:40,007 --> 00:33:41,674
One key down, two more to go.

618
00:33:41,776 --> 00:33:43,639
And, of course, me.

619
00:33:44,514 --> 00:33:45,745
Load up.

620
00:33:45,847 --> 00:33:47,713
Next stop, Sanctuary City.

621
00:33:47,815 --> 00:33:48,613
All right!

622
00:33:48,716 --> 00:33:49,846
Road trip!

623
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:55,354
All right, mask up.

624
00:33:56,727 --> 00:33:57,851
We wanna keep a low profile.

625
00:34:01,995 --> 00:34:03,730
Market clear.

626
00:34:03,832 --> 00:34:04,932
Copy that.

627
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:06,533
Oh, this place
sure has changed,

628
00:34:06,635 --> 00:34:08,126
for the worse.

629
00:34:08,295 --> 00:34:08,928
Back off. Back off!
Heading to Gate 23.

630
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:11,870
Oh, my.

631
00:34:11,972 --> 00:34:13,300
Who's this handsome devil?

632
00:34:13,402 --> 00:34:14,340
He's a badass killer.

633
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:18,812
And the reward's
just gone up to 150 grand.

634
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:19,913
Looks like you're not

635
00:34:20,015 --> 00:34:21,639
the only one
that's special, kid.

636
00:34:21,741 --> 00:34:23,776
Cannibal frog convention!

637
00:34:23,879 --> 00:34:25,551
Okay, so we're here.

638
00:34:25,654 --> 00:34:26,646
Now what?

639
00:34:26,748 --> 00:34:27,788
I need
to locate my contact.

640
00:34:27,890 --> 00:34:29,289
Moxxi will know how to find her.

641
00:34:29,922 --> 00:34:30,923
Moxxi?

642
00:34:31,025 --> 00:34:32,253
Yeah. You know her?

643
00:34:32,355 --> 00:34:33,551
Yeah, kind of.

644
00:34:33,653 --> 00:34:35,053
I mean, it's been a while.

645
00:34:35,189 --> 00:34:36,389
Would you be a doll
and hold this? Thank you.

646
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:38,624
Kriegy! Give me a ride.

647
00:34:38,726 --> 00:34:40,165
Hey.

648
00:34:40,267 --> 00:34:41,602
We're trying to stay low-key.

649
00:34:41,704 --> 00:34:43,400
Hey. Did you find

650
00:34:43,502 --> 00:34:45,971
what you were looking for
in Fyrestone?

651
00:34:46,073 --> 00:34:47,500
Never seen you before, stranger.

652
00:34:47,602 --> 00:34:50,909
Nice try, Miss Vladof Infinity.

653
00:34:51,011 --> 00:34:52,904
I never forget a gun.

654
00:34:53,006 --> 00:34:56,443
What are you up to now,
Not-A-Vault-Hunter?

655
00:34:56,545 --> 00:34:57,616
She's vault hunting.

656
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:00,589
I knew it.

657
00:35:00,691 --> 00:35:01,420
I told you, I knew it.

658
00:35:12,031 --> 00:35:13,867
Well, well, well.

659
00:35:13,969 --> 00:35:15,970
Look what the skag dragged in.

660
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:17,568
-Hey, Mox.
- Get on in there.

661
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:21,176
Oh, you are most welcome.

662
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:30,850
Milkshake for
my little sugarplum,

663
00:35:30,952 --> 00:35:32,952
and drinks for my friends.

664
00:35:33,054 --> 00:35:35,547
I got something to show you.

665
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:37,658
Everyone, come over here.

666
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,857
Step into my office.

667
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:40,987
Roland?

668
00:35:42,932 --> 00:35:44,760
- Roland.
-I got it.

669
00:35:46,835 --> 00:35:48,394
Excuse me.

670
00:35:48,496 --> 00:35:49,497
I knew it was you.

671
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,665
- Oh, my God.
-Hey, Larry.

672
00:35:51,767 --> 00:35:53,707
You probably
don't remember me, but

673
00:35:53,809 --> 00:35:55,870
I sure remember you.

674
00:35:57,441 --> 00:35:58,911
Your mama was a good woman.

675
00:35:59,013 --> 00:36:02,041
Yeah, well, wouldn't know.

676
00:36:03,649 --> 00:36:06,188
All right. So,
where is this, uh, scientist?

677
00:36:08,023 --> 00:36:09,550
So, this is where you're headed.

678
00:36:09,652 --> 00:36:11,749
You go all the way
up those stairs

679
00:36:11,851 --> 00:36:14,027
and right there is the elevator.

680
00:36:14,129 --> 00:36:15,729
-Mm-hm.
- Push the button.

681
00:36:15,831 --> 00:36:17,023
Passcode's "ECHO."

682
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:18,827
- ECHO?
- ECHO.

683
00:36:20,828 --> 00:36:22,501
You sure it's safe
to stay there?

684
00:36:22,603 --> 00:36:25,567
Yeah, as long as this one here
don't blow up the joint.

685
00:36:25,669 --> 00:36:27,666
How's that milkshake there,
sugar pie?

686
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,405
Listen.

687
00:36:31,507 --> 00:36:32,643
For whatever it's worth...

688
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:37,175
I'm real happy
that you came back home.

689
00:36:37,277 --> 00:36:40,121
And I hope that you know
how much your mama loved you.

690
00:36:40,223 --> 00:36:42,582
She always told me
how special you were.

691
00:36:42,684 --> 00:36:44,017
You know, I appreciate the help.

692
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:46,085
Let's just leave it at that.

693
00:36:49,027 --> 00:36:50,362
Right.

694
00:36:50,464 --> 00:36:51,594
When they were chasing you,
I was like,

695
00:36:51,696 --> 00:36:52,627
"Hey, don't shoot that guy.
He's my roomie."

696
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:54,630
- You... You said that?
- Yeah, man.

697
00:36:54,732 --> 00:36:56,832
Hey, you see
your bounty went up?

698
00:36:57,731 --> 00:36:58,705
- My?
- Your bounty.

699
00:36:58,807 --> 00:37:00,138
Get outta here.

700
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,699
Knoxx is on the warpath, stud.

701
00:37:01,801 --> 00:37:03,376
What'd you do to her, man?

702
00:37:03,478 --> 00:37:05,642
Man, I kind of... kind of
ghosted her, you know?

703
00:37:05,744 --> 00:37:08,076
Yeah, you did, man.
You ghosted all of us, man.

704
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:11,418
Yeah.

705
00:37:13,179 --> 00:37:14,955
Anyway, man,
it was really good to see you.

706
00:37:15,057 --> 00:37:16,323
And, you know, you can trust me.

707
00:37:16,425 --> 00:37:19,423
We're friends, man.
I'm not gonna tell a soul.

708
00:37:19,525 --> 00:37:20,760
Oh, Larry,
I'm not worried about you.

709
00:37:20,862 --> 00:37:22,094
You're my guy.

710
00:37:22,196 --> 00:37:24,760
You're my main man.

711
00:37:24,862 --> 00:37:26,796
I got a feeling you're not
going to tell anybody.

712
00:37:32,098 --> 00:37:33,635
Is he going to be okay?

713
00:37:33,737 --> 00:37:35,672
Well, he'll have
a hell of a hangover.

714
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:38,674
Ooh, who knew electricity
provoked defecation?

715
00:37:38,776 --> 00:37:40,238
Hey.

716
00:37:42,118 --> 00:37:42,980
Y'all better
hustle out the back.

717
00:37:43,082 --> 00:37:44,083
Go out this way.

718
00:37:44,185 --> 00:37:45,945
I got these guys. Go on. Go on.

719
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:48,785
- Claptrap, let's go.
- Go on. Go on. Go on.

720
00:37:48,887 --> 00:37:52,621
Your buddy boy here just drank
about 10 shots too many

721
00:37:52,723 --> 00:37:55,028
then he dropped
like a sack of potatoes.

722
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:57,362
I think you forgot me.

723
00:37:57,464 --> 00:38:01,468
Mm. And a tip
is always appreciated.

724
00:38:07,975 --> 00:38:09,106
All right.

725
00:38:09,208 --> 00:38:10,642
This looks like it.

726
00:38:12,077 --> 00:38:13,315
ECHO.

727
00:38:18,919 --> 00:38:19,915
ECHO?

728
00:38:21,155 --> 00:38:22,055
Sure that's the password?

729
00:38:22,157 --> 00:38:24,425
Maybe you gotta echo the "ECHO."

730
00:38:25,157 --> 00:38:26,893
ECHO. ECHO.

731
00:38:26,995 --> 00:38:28,088
All right.

732
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,167
You fools would literally
be dead without me.

733
00:38:33,269 --> 00:38:34,901
- You need me.
-Here we go.

734
00:38:35,003 --> 00:38:36,732
Come on, Claptrap.

735
00:38:36,835 --> 00:38:38,202
Where are we going?
Up.

736
00:38:47,107 --> 00:38:48,677
So, you trust
this woman?

737
00:38:48,779 --> 00:38:51,016
She's a xeno-archaeologist,
all right?

738
00:38:51,118 --> 00:38:52,846
She's a little odd.

739
00:38:52,948 --> 00:38:54,714
But she knows everything
about the vault.

740
00:38:54,816 --> 00:38:57,156
So, if she says something weird,

741
00:38:57,258 --> 00:38:58,654
don't let it get to you, okay?

742
00:38:58,756 --> 00:39:00,994
I am 10
to the 100th power

743
00:39:01,096 --> 00:39:02,727
impressed with this place.

744
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:05,890
Cool.

745
00:39:05,992 --> 00:39:07,867
Oh! I see you have the girl.

746
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:09,269
That's right.

747
00:39:09,371 --> 00:39:10,834
Did you find
a vault key, too?

748
00:39:11,764 --> 00:39:13,939
Hi, I'm Tina.

749
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,333
The special one.

750
00:39:15,975 --> 00:39:16,972
Huh.

751
00:39:19,882 --> 00:39:20,877
Tannis.

752
00:39:31,859 --> 00:39:32,592
Oh.

753
00:39:33,863 --> 00:39:35,320
Hello, Lilith.

754
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,994
Okay, good.
So you guys know each other.

755
00:39:39,902 --> 00:39:40,930
Unfortunately.

756
00:39:42,038 --> 00:39:43,669
I'm not staying here.

757
00:39:44,807 --> 00:39:45,772
What?

758
00:39:45,874 --> 00:39:47,538
Okay.

759
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,367
But you all smell
like thresher urine.

760
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:51,874
And your wanted poster
just went up all over town.

761
00:39:51,976 --> 00:39:54,810
So, I suggest that you all
settle in and clean up.

762
00:39:54,912 --> 00:39:57,149
Now, the electroshower
is right over there.

763
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:58,485
Ooh, shower.

764
00:39:58,587 --> 00:40:00,453
Hey, kids,
we're out of here. Let's go.

765
00:40:00,556 --> 00:40:02,113
Lilith? Hey, I get it.
There's history here.

766
00:40:02,215 --> 00:40:03,717
I don't even need
to know what it is.

767
00:40:03,819 --> 00:40:05,252
The point is that she's right.

768
00:40:05,354 --> 00:40:06,786
If there's a poster of me,
that means there's one of you.

769
00:40:06,888 --> 00:40:08,087
They're looking for all of us.

770
00:40:08,223 --> 00:40:08,962
I hate to say it,
but we don't have a choice.

771
00:40:09,064 --> 00:40:10,091
We gotta sit tight.

772
00:40:12,058 --> 00:40:13,726
Lilith, we don't have a choice.

773
00:40:13,828 --> 00:40:15,235
What is happening, Tannis?

774
00:40:15,337 --> 00:40:16,961
-Electroshower.
- Wait.

775
00:40:17,063 --> 00:40:18,806
Wait, guys.

776
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,369
-Time to shower.
- Claptrap.

777
00:40:22,471 --> 00:40:23,911
♪ It's time for showering
Showering, time for some... ♪

778
00:40:24,013 --> 00:40:25,245
That's not... No.

779
00:40:25,347 --> 00:40:27,372
Claptrap.

780
00:40:30,085 --> 00:40:31,516
Rebooting.

781
00:40:31,618 --> 00:40:32,751
Everybody,
just settle down, please.

782
00:40:33,747 --> 00:40:34,786
Settle down.

783
00:40:35,784 --> 00:40:37,016
Hey, hey! Settle down.

784
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:38,249
Square root of 929,000...

785
00:40:38,418 --> 00:40:40,093
I am basing my assumption
that you're upset

786
00:40:40,195 --> 00:40:42,328
on your body language.

787
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:44,565
Perceptive as ever, I see.

788
00:40:48,368 --> 00:40:49,735
Because of your mother?

789
00:40:50,436 --> 00:40:52,804
Uh, no, because of you.

790
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,510
She trusted you...

791
00:40:57,376 --> 00:40:58,975
to take care of me.

792
00:41:00,149 --> 00:41:01,483
But you ran back here

793
00:41:01,585 --> 00:41:05,982
to chase after that mystical
Eridian vault bullshit.

794
00:41:07,256 --> 00:41:08,952
I left you with tradespeople.

795
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:11,887
Oh.

796
00:41:11,989 --> 00:41:14,060
Yes. You mean
the murderers and thieves

797
00:41:14,162 --> 00:41:15,453
on the mining ship.

798
00:41:16,298 --> 00:41:17,829
It's what your mother wanted.

799
00:41:19,094 --> 00:41:21,034
She wanted me
to learn how to kill

800
00:41:21,136 --> 00:41:22,364
by the age of 10?

801
00:41:22,466 --> 00:41:24,295
How to survive.

802
00:41:24,397 --> 00:41:26,371
I had to come back here
to finish her work.

803
00:41:26,473 --> 00:41:28,235
She believed the Eridian vault

804
00:41:28,337 --> 00:41:30,576
had the power to change things
for the better and...

805
00:41:30,678 --> 00:41:33,339
She traded her daughter
for a waste of time.

806
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:52,160
Go back inside.

807
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:54,228
It's not safe.

808
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:56,571
I can look after myself.

809
00:41:57,305 --> 00:41:59,068
Told you I'm special.

810
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:01,235
Aren't we all?

811
00:42:02,142 --> 00:42:03,374
Yeah.

812
00:42:03,476 --> 00:42:04,845
They made me that way.

813
00:42:04,948 --> 00:42:06,075
Made you?

814
00:42:07,281 --> 00:42:08,506
What do you mean?

815
00:42:11,144 --> 00:42:12,919
Your father is Deukalian Atlas,

816
00:42:13,022 --> 00:42:14,252
isn't he?

817
00:42:14,354 --> 00:42:16,289
Yes and no.

818
00:42:16,391 --> 00:42:19,123
Not a "yes or no" question.

819
00:42:19,225 --> 00:42:20,595
He's...

820
00:42:22,030 --> 00:42:22,927
my...

821
00:42:25,033 --> 00:42:26,733
creator.

822
00:42:28,297 --> 00:42:32,638
Atlas is bananapants obsessed
with the vault.

823
00:42:32,741 --> 00:42:36,574
He says only a daughter
of Eridia can open it.

824
00:42:36,676 --> 00:42:38,107
He found a piece
of the vault key,

825
00:42:40,039 --> 00:42:41,807
and on that piece

826
00:42:41,909 --> 00:42:44,014
was a tiny bit...

827
00:42:44,988 --> 00:42:45,953
of blood.

828
00:42:46,055 --> 00:42:47,721
Eridian blood.

829
00:42:49,258 --> 00:42:50,455
He cloned an Eridian.

830
00:42:50,557 --> 00:42:52,957
And guess who that Eridian is?

831
00:42:54,494 --> 00:42:56,092
Hmm. Is her name Tina?

832
00:42:57,065 --> 00:42:57,797
Boom.

833
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:01,158
But it's all good.

834
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,471
I don't care I grew up in a lab.

835
00:43:04,573 --> 00:43:06,966
I never wanted
a mother or a father.

836
00:43:07,068 --> 00:43:10,441
He created you to open a vault.

837
00:43:10,543 --> 00:43:12,775
God, what an asshole.

838
00:43:12,877 --> 00:43:14,715
That's an understatement.

839
00:43:16,178 --> 00:43:18,812
He'll use whatever
technology's inside

840
00:43:18,914 --> 00:43:20,413
and make superweapons.

841
00:43:21,390 --> 00:43:23,757
The dude's got major issues.

842
00:43:25,559 --> 00:43:27,959
I'm just a product to Atlas.

843
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:30,188
If he gets me,

844
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,062
he's gonna make me
open the vault.

845
00:43:33,770 --> 00:43:36,000
Then he's just gonna lock me up
into another secret lab

846
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:37,936
and do more experiments.

847
00:43:39,642 --> 00:43:41,109
And if you saw
the things they did

848
00:43:41,211 --> 00:43:42,209
to the other clones...

849
00:43:42,311 --> 00:43:43,810
He's not gonna find you.

850
00:43:57,293 --> 00:43:59,122
Yo! Whassup?

851
00:44:00,062 --> 00:44:01,360
Yeah!

852
00:44:01,462 --> 00:44:03,297
Hey, there, sugar chips.

853
00:44:03,399 --> 00:44:04,826
You need a firmware update?

854
00:44:04,928 --> 00:44:06,390
Piss off, short stuff.

855
00:44:06,492 --> 00:44:08,098
Someone needs
an oil change.

856
00:44:10,637 --> 00:44:13,871
My daddy always had a saying.

857
00:44:13,974 --> 00:44:17,068
Never trust a man
who can't hold his liquor.

858
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:18,540
She tased me, all right?

859
00:44:18,642 --> 00:44:19,871
I love alcohol.

860
00:44:19,973 --> 00:44:20,974
I can be wild.

861
00:44:21,076 --> 00:44:22,340
As for that little girl,

862
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:24,584
you don't think
the second I saw her,

863
00:44:24,686 --> 00:44:26,077
I wouldn't hand her
right over to you

864
00:44:26,179 --> 00:44:27,221
just to get rid of you?

865
00:44:27,323 --> 00:44:28,546
I admire the fight,

866
00:44:28,648 --> 00:44:30,548
but let me take you through
what happens next.

867
00:44:30,650 --> 00:44:32,154
Spare parts!
We seal the city...

868
00:44:32,256 --> 00:44:34,093
Anyone got
spare parts that I can use?

869
00:44:34,195 --> 00:44:34,960
Uh-oh.

870
00:44:36,366 --> 00:44:37,395
Hey, hey, that's his robot.

871
00:44:37,497 --> 00:44:38,697
It's an old CL4P...

872
00:44:38,799 --> 00:44:39,897
Excuse me.
Coming through.

873
00:44:39,999 --> 00:44:41,736
Got a computer virus.
Highly contagious.

874
00:44:43,162 --> 00:44:44,197
Clear the street!

875
00:44:44,299 --> 00:44:45,504
You,
down on the ground.

876
00:44:45,606 --> 00:44:46,664
Move, move, move!

877
00:44:49,141 --> 00:44:51,377
Now that we have
Tina and the first key,

878
00:44:51,479 --> 00:44:52,813
I wanna show you this.

879
00:44:54,617 --> 00:44:56,910
This is a mining journal
left behind

880
00:44:57,012 --> 00:44:58,278
by a corporate bureaucrat.

881
00:44:58,381 --> 00:45:00,253
He cataloged everything
the miners brought in,

882
00:45:00,355 --> 00:45:01,452
most of it useless.

883
00:45:01,554 --> 00:45:03,989
But on this page...

884
00:45:08,692 --> 00:45:10,259
Another key.

885
00:45:10,361 --> 00:45:13,260
He thought it was a useless
piece of Eridian pottery.

886
00:45:13,362 --> 00:45:15,896
He had no clue
they'd found a vault key.

887
00:45:15,998 --> 00:45:17,428
That makes two of three.

888
00:45:17,530 --> 00:45:19,197
So,
if this is the second key,

889
00:45:19,299 --> 00:45:21,201
why don't you already have it?

890
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:23,536
Because the mine
is in Caustic Caverns.

891
00:45:24,180 --> 00:45:26,039
Oh, shit.

892
00:45:26,141 --> 00:45:27,980
Danger! Red alert!

893
00:45:28,082 --> 00:45:30,275
People, we need to move!
The soldiers, they're coming!

894
00:45:30,377 --> 00:45:31,409
They have guns!
They're shooting!

895
00:45:31,511 --> 00:45:32,483
- They're firing!
- Clappy, slow your roll.

896
00:45:32,585 --> 00:45:33,885
What is the dealio?

897
00:45:33,987 --> 00:45:36,481
The soldier woman
who really hates Roland,

898
00:45:36,583 --> 00:45:39,056
which suggests
the two of them had some...

899
00:45:39,158 --> 00:45:41,156
- Come on, get to the point.
- She was at the bar

900
00:45:41,258 --> 00:45:43,230
interrogating Moxxi
and your friend Larry...

901
00:45:43,332 --> 00:45:44,288
Was that his name?

902
00:45:44,390 --> 00:45:45,992
Seemed like a decent roommate.

903
00:45:46,094 --> 00:45:47,294
Did they see you?

904
00:45:47,397 --> 00:45:50,604
Do you promise
not to be angry if I say yes?

905
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,107
Lance units,
block all exits.

906
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:55,343
No one leaves.

907
00:45:55,445 --> 00:45:57,110
Get this thing out of here.

908
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:58,643
Masks off.

909
00:45:58,745 --> 00:46:00,147
Of course, Commander.

910
00:46:00,249 --> 00:46:02,246
Of course. Hey!

911
00:46:02,348 --> 00:46:05,511
Double-perched custom Blaster
with ionized projectiles.

912
00:46:05,613 --> 00:46:08,122
That'll outpace any
bone shredder on Pandora.

913
00:46:08,224 --> 00:46:09,183
You wanna trade?

914
00:46:09,285 --> 00:46:10,954
I'll give you
special price, huh?

915
00:46:11,056 --> 00:46:14,586
Sanctuary
is now on lockdown.

916
00:46:14,688 --> 00:46:17,261
No one goes anywhere
until we find that robot.

917
00:46:17,363 --> 00:46:20,626
Is there any way out of here
that doesn't involve garbage?

918
00:46:22,204 --> 00:46:23,002
Um...

919
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:25,163
No.

920
00:46:46,492 --> 00:46:47,526
What?

921
00:46:47,628 --> 00:46:48,654
Did you guys wanna use it?

922
00:46:52,792 --> 00:46:56,162
The entrance is underneath
all of that debris.

923
00:46:56,265 --> 00:46:57,168
Under there.

924
00:47:00,333 --> 00:47:03,136
Whoo! Look what I got!

925
00:47:03,238 --> 00:47:04,639
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.

926
00:47:04,741 --> 00:47:05,704
Open it.

927
00:47:10,747 --> 00:47:12,544
Hello.

928
00:47:12,646 --> 00:47:14,348
Would you
look at that? A ladder.

929
00:47:14,450 --> 00:47:16,589
Unfortunately,
my design doesn't facilitate

930
00:47:16,691 --> 00:47:18,257
this type of vertical travel.

931
00:47:18,359 --> 00:47:19,350
Drats.

932
00:47:19,452 --> 00:47:20,895
Guess I'll just...

933
00:47:23,125 --> 00:47:24,698
Well...

934
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,329
- Destiny awaits.
-I'm fine!

935
00:47:28,196 --> 00:47:30,430
Mm! Meat soup.

936
00:47:30,532 --> 00:47:33,171
Chemical waste
from the mining equipment.

937
00:47:33,273 --> 00:47:35,501
It's corrosive enough
to dissolve almost anything

938
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,043
except the natural crystals
in this cavern.

939
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:40,878
How are we gonna
get through this?

940
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:43,245
Well, it's not gonna
be that way.

941
00:47:43,347 --> 00:47:45,251
Looks like we gotta
take the high road.

942
00:47:45,353 --> 00:47:47,050
Krieg.

943
00:47:47,152 --> 00:47:48,580
Let's see if we can
grab this here.

944
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:50,623
Luckily,
my wheel's too large,

945
00:47:50,725 --> 00:47:52,385
so I'll just watch you all melt

946
00:47:52,487 --> 00:47:53,818
from a safe
and reasonable distance.

947
00:47:56,062 --> 00:47:58,058
You are small enough
to get in there.

948
00:47:58,160 --> 00:47:59,527
Head through the tunnel,

949
00:47:59,629 --> 00:48:01,934
locate the main access control
panel and then unlock

950
00:48:02,036 --> 00:48:03,604
- the door at the end.
-Can do!

951
00:48:03,706 --> 00:48:05,369
- Quietly.
-No problem.

952
00:48:05,471 --> 00:48:07,598
I wouldn't want anything bad
to happen to each one of you

953
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:09,542
in the most
horrifying way possible.

954
00:48:09,644 --> 00:48:12,073
All right, I'll go first.

955
00:48:12,175 --> 00:48:14,306
- I got this.
- No, I got it.

956
00:48:14,408 --> 00:48:15,640
- I got it.
-Tina!

957
00:48:15,743 --> 00:48:17,417
Coming through!
Hey, hey.

958
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,550
Relax.

959
00:48:18,652 --> 00:48:19,584
I'm the lightest.

960
00:48:19,686 --> 00:48:21,186
- Tina!
- Hey!

961
00:48:28,595 --> 00:48:29,689
Ladies first.

962
00:48:30,763 --> 00:48:32,065
Don't mind if I do.

963
00:48:42,677 --> 00:48:43,637
- You all right?
- Mm-hmm.

964
00:48:46,206 --> 00:48:47,281
Be careful.

965
00:48:56,688 --> 00:48:58,258
Guys.

966
00:48:58,360 --> 00:48:59,092
Look.

967
00:49:07,399 --> 00:49:10,263
Hope blooms
in the strangest places.

968
00:49:10,365 --> 00:49:11,330
It's kind of pretty.

969
00:49:11,432 --> 00:49:12,506
Mission accomplished!

970
00:49:12,608 --> 00:49:14,369
The door is unlocked.

971
00:49:14,471 --> 00:49:15,909
♪ Who's the best?
I'm the best ♪

972
00:49:16,011 --> 00:49:17,644
♪ Give me a job
I pass the test ♪

973
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,543
Can't take him anywhere.

974
00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:19,643
Well?

975
00:49:19,745 --> 00:49:20,740
You're welcome.

976
00:49:21,882 --> 00:49:24,144
Impossible to please.

977
00:49:35,664 --> 00:49:37,463
Scream showers.

978
00:49:37,565 --> 00:49:39,030
It's Bloodshots.

979
00:49:39,132 --> 00:49:40,629
Yeah, their symbols
are everywhere.

980
00:49:40,731 --> 00:49:44,704
These are the Psychos
other psychos are afraid of.

981
00:49:44,806 --> 00:49:46,566
They're probably still here.

982
00:49:46,668 --> 00:49:48,332
- Let's go find out.
-  No bombs.

983
00:49:48,434 --> 00:49:49,843
I'll be surgical.

984
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,837
There's only one of you
in the world...

985
00:49:53,681 --> 00:49:54,708
and you're special.

986
00:49:57,614 --> 00:49:59,485
You guys sit tight.
Wait for us to come back.

987
00:49:59,587 --> 00:50:00,681
Come on, Lil.

988
00:50:17,872 --> 00:50:19,667
Dealt with Bloodshots before?

989
00:50:20,509 --> 00:50:21,499
Once.

990
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:22,740
How'd you make it out?

991
00:50:22,842 --> 00:50:24,945
Kind words and hugs?

992
00:50:25,047 --> 00:50:25,909
I don't know what it is
that happens to 'em

993
00:50:26,011 --> 00:50:27,609
when they're down here

994
00:50:27,711 --> 00:50:29,314
but it's like they get hit
with an extra dose of crazy.

995
00:50:35,222 --> 00:50:36,981
Strip the flesh,
salt the wound!

996
00:50:40,161 --> 00:50:42,355
- There's too many to shoot.
- Or blow up?

997
00:50:42,457 --> 00:50:44,062
Well, we can't really blend in.

998
00:50:44,164 --> 00:50:45,566
We don't look
anything like them.

999
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:46,929
Except you, handsome.

1000
00:50:47,031 --> 00:50:48,969
Thank you!

1001
00:50:49,072 --> 00:50:50,432
Well,
according to my calculations,

1002
00:50:50,534 --> 00:50:51,770
the odds of a successful
stealth operation

1003
00:50:51,872 --> 00:50:53,173
in this scenario is...

1004
00:50:53,904 --> 00:50:55,773
0%? Wow!

1005
00:50:55,875 --> 00:50:57,475
You never see that!

1006
00:50:57,577 --> 00:50:59,911
Well, I guess that's it then.
Back to the truck, right?

1007
00:51:00,013 --> 00:51:01,480
Did you factor in a distraction?

1008
00:51:01,583 --> 00:51:02,947
Of course.

1009
00:51:03,049 --> 00:51:04,313
I analyzed 16 million versions

1010
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:05,749
where one of you
creates a distraction.

1011
00:51:05,851 --> 00:51:07,378
Total failure.

1012
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:09,887
No, not one of us.

1013
00:51:09,989 --> 00:51:11,325
Wait, who else is...?

1014
00:51:11,427 --> 00:51:12,927
Oh, no.

1015
00:51:18,734 --> 00:51:21,393
Coming through.

1016
00:51:23,496 --> 00:51:24,237
Hi, there.

1017
00:51:25,068 --> 00:51:26,305
How you doing?

1018
00:51:29,574 --> 00:51:31,772
Just a little nervous laughter
to crack the ice.

1019
00:51:32,846 --> 00:51:34,607
Shiny!

1020
00:51:34,709 --> 00:51:36,309
Just rolling through town

1021
00:51:36,411 --> 00:51:37,778
looking for a good time.

1022
00:51:41,449 --> 00:51:42,755
Ladies and gentlemen!

1023
00:51:42,857 --> 00:51:44,587
Your attention, please.

1024
00:51:47,555 --> 00:51:49,127
I am here because I want to be

1025
00:51:49,229 --> 00:51:50,654
and not for a more
justifiable reason

1026
00:51:50,756 --> 00:51:52,326
like trying to be a distraction.

1027
00:51:52,428 --> 00:51:54,264
Even though it makes no sense

1028
00:51:54,366 --> 00:51:55,802
for me to say
what I'm about to say,

1029
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,500
and even though anyone rational

1030
00:51:57,602 --> 00:51:59,704
would suspect it was just
part of a crude plan,

1031
00:51:59,806 --> 00:52:00,975
I have decided

1032
00:52:01,077 --> 00:52:04,341
entirely on my own
to say the following.

1033
00:52:04,443 --> 00:52:07,971
Y'all bitches
need to eat your own butts

1034
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:09,314
with your poopy-mouth...

1035
00:52:09,416 --> 00:52:11,645
...ass-faces until you die
from loser poisoning

1036
00:52:11,747 --> 00:52:15,448
like the stupid
pus-crotches that you is.

1037
00:52:19,758 --> 00:52:21,894
Was that too much?
It was too much, wasn't it?

1038
00:52:21,996 --> 00:52:23,391
What took it over the edge?

1039
00:52:23,493 --> 00:52:24,759
Was it the
"poopy-mouth ass-faces"?

1040
00:52:26,635 --> 00:52:27,762
Stairs. Come on!

1041
00:52:33,570 --> 00:52:35,132
Not in the undercarriage!

1042
00:52:37,141 --> 00:52:38,179
My programming...

1043
00:52:40,773 --> 00:52:41,814
Oh, that's gonna leave a mark.

1044
00:52:43,852 --> 00:52:45,478
Son of a... You got me!

1045
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:46,818
Okay, I'm dead. How about that?

1046
00:52:51,861 --> 00:52:53,150
Is he going to be all right?

1047
00:52:59,659 --> 00:53:01,893
Excellent plan.

1048
00:53:01,996 --> 00:53:04,304
Who would have guessed
they'd shoot me, right?

1049
00:53:05,973 --> 00:53:07,032
Well, we survived.

1050
00:53:08,942 --> 00:53:10,541
So much for your 0%.

1051
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:13,742
You're not out yet.

1052
00:53:15,842 --> 00:53:17,141
I think
the key's in here.

1053
00:53:20,052 --> 00:53:21,351
Sweet.

1054
00:53:21,453 --> 00:53:23,851
So, the key
is in one of these crates.

1055
00:53:24,858 --> 00:53:25,853
One of these

1056
00:53:26,861 --> 00:53:29,029
kabillion crates.

1057
00:53:29,131 --> 00:53:31,561
Yeah, this is gonna
take a minute.

1058
00:53:31,663 --> 00:53:32,797
Four days
if you work around the clock

1059
00:53:32,899 --> 00:53:34,399
which you can't,

1060
00:53:34,501 --> 00:53:36,602
because your bodies
require rest every 16 hours.

1061
00:53:36,704 --> 00:53:37,896
Lazy!

1062
00:53:37,998 --> 00:53:40,037
Not if those psycho Raiders
find us first.

1063
00:53:40,139 --> 00:53:42,207
Those are Bloodshots.

1064
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:43,767
Raiders live above.
Not down here.

1065
00:53:43,869 --> 00:53:45,276
There are no Raiders down here.

1066
00:53:45,378 --> 00:53:46,707
Tannis, nobody's talking
about Raiders.

1067
00:53:46,810 --> 00:53:48,148
What's the big deal
about Raiders?

1068
00:53:48,250 --> 00:53:49,379
I know,
but you brought up Raiders.

1069
00:53:49,481 --> 00:53:51,084
How about
we forget about it?

1070
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,050
Am I missing
something here?

1071
00:53:52,152 --> 00:53:53,415
But I don't understand.

1072
00:53:53,517 --> 00:53:54,480
Forget about
the Raiders!

1073
00:53:54,582 --> 00:53:55,718
Just forget about it.

1074
00:53:56,925 --> 00:53:57,753
I'm sorry.

1075
00:54:33,795 --> 00:54:35,253
I understand...

1076
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,264
- Bloodshots are down here.
- You keep bringing up Raiders.

1077
00:54:37,366 --> 00:54:38,932
- Tannis, I swear to God...
-I found it.

1078
00:54:39,035 --> 00:54:40,999
- What?
-The second key.

1079
00:54:41,101 --> 00:54:42,927
How... How did...?

1080
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,438
I don't know.
Just lucky, I guess.

1081
00:54:47,408 --> 00:54:48,700
Yeah, we'll see
how lucky you are.

1082
00:54:48,802 --> 00:54:50,009
We still gotta get out of here.

1083
00:54:50,111 --> 00:54:51,710
There's an exit portal this way.

1084
00:54:51,812 --> 00:54:52,643
Come on.

1085
00:54:57,042 --> 00:54:57,945
Shh!

1086
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:00,618
What's that?

1087
00:55:06,162 --> 00:55:08,087
What? I'm expelling
the excess lead.

1088
00:55:10,332 --> 00:55:12,031
Big bullet. Big bullet coming.
There we go.

1089
00:55:12,133 --> 00:55:13,196
Can't you do this another time?

1090
00:55:13,298 --> 00:55:14,800
This has to happen now.

1091
00:55:14,902 --> 00:55:17,169
Don't judge me.

1092
00:55:20,241 --> 00:55:21,170
What?
How is this funny?

1093
00:55:21,272 --> 00:55:22,572
You keep it down.

1094
00:55:22,674 --> 00:55:24,003
Do I judge you
when you blast out a loaf?

1095
00:55:24,105 --> 00:55:25,346
- We don't wanna attract...
-Look out!

1096
00:55:30,316 --> 00:55:31,481
A little help?

1097
00:55:32,783 --> 00:55:33,813
Incoming!

1098
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:35,889
Go, go!
Okay, going now!

1099
00:56:00,882 --> 00:56:01,877
Tannis!

1100
00:56:03,709 --> 00:56:04,484
Thank you.

1101
00:56:05,350 --> 00:56:06,585
On your left!

1102
00:56:07,051 --> 00:56:08,048
Wow!

1103
00:56:17,693 --> 00:56:18,696
Come here, girlie!

1104
00:56:28,372 --> 00:56:29,776
What are you doing?

1105
00:56:29,878 --> 00:56:30,967
I needed a gun.

1106
00:56:31,069 --> 00:56:33,141
So you ask for it, Tannis. Ask!

1107
00:56:33,243 --> 00:56:34,606
Move!

1108
00:56:43,056 --> 00:56:44,348
That way!

1109
00:56:46,890 --> 00:56:48,952
We've got this, guys!

1110
00:56:49,054 --> 00:56:50,664
There's nothing we can't do!

1111
00:56:50,766 --> 00:56:51,756
Stairs!

1112
00:56:51,858 --> 00:56:52,898
Krieg, help me! I'm not...

1113
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:53,797
Go, go!

1114
00:57:08,709 --> 00:57:09,748
Lilith, I got you!

1115
00:57:09,850 --> 00:57:10,880
Go!

1116
00:57:15,287 --> 00:57:16,281
Roland!

1117
00:57:18,861 --> 00:57:19,823
Watch out!

1118
00:57:20,763 --> 00:57:21,495
Go, go!

1119
00:57:32,204 --> 00:57:33,573
Time to go.

1120
00:57:40,648 --> 00:57:42,213
I'm sure
we're past the hard part.

1121
00:57:42,315 --> 00:57:43,407
Okay.

1122
00:57:51,327 --> 00:57:52,757
Go, go, go!
We gotta move!

1123
00:57:58,092 --> 00:58:00,696
Let go of me!
Tina!

1124
00:58:00,798 --> 00:58:02,726
Lilith!
Hello!

1125
00:58:09,343 --> 00:58:10,476
Follow me this way.

1126
00:58:10,578 --> 00:58:11,976
I have a tremendous
sense of direction.

1127
00:58:12,078 --> 00:58:13,046
Oh, God!

1128
00:58:27,162 --> 00:58:27,891
Help me!

1129
00:58:33,124 --> 00:58:34,326
Krieg, spin me!

1130
00:58:35,534 --> 00:58:36,761
I found it! I found it!

1131
00:58:36,863 --> 00:58:37,863
There's an elevator!

1132
00:58:37,965 --> 00:58:39,738
Follow me. This way. Come on.

1133
00:58:41,333 --> 00:58:44,104
- Roland!
-Clappy, go! Go! Go!

1134
00:58:44,206 --> 00:58:45,810
Lilith!
Don't leave me behind again!

1135
00:58:49,781 --> 00:58:51,816
There's a service elevator
this way!

1136
00:58:55,485 --> 00:58:56,786
It's up here.

1137
00:58:56,888 --> 00:58:59,750
- This way. Oh, no.
-Go! Go, go, go!

1138
00:58:59,852 --> 00:59:00,955
Shit!

1139
00:59:01,057 --> 00:59:02,752
This is gonna take some time.
Hold this.

1140
00:59:02,855 --> 00:59:03,864
Claptrap!

1141
00:59:03,966 --> 00:59:05,288
I need help!

1142
00:59:05,390 --> 00:59:07,223
Uh,
in front of everyone?

1143
00:59:07,325 --> 00:59:08,431
Yes!
Look away!

1144
00:59:08,533 --> 00:59:10,796
Look away! I command you!

1145
00:59:10,898 --> 00:59:12,061
Krieg, we got company.

1146
00:59:12,163 --> 00:59:14,801
It's time to bleed!

1147
00:59:14,903 --> 00:59:16,071
- Come on!
- I am trying!

1148
00:59:20,048 --> 00:59:21,111
Krieg, wait!

1149
00:59:21,213 --> 00:59:22,407
Krieg!

1150
00:59:34,261 --> 00:59:35,418
It's not working.

1151
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:36,960
Aren't you supposed
to be smart?

1152
00:59:42,099 --> 00:59:43,302
I'll turn you
into a meat bicycle!

1153
00:59:43,404 --> 00:59:44,528
Another victim!

1154
00:59:55,249 --> 00:59:56,474
Thanks, kid.

1155
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:06,625
Tannis!

1156
01:00:06,727 --> 01:00:08,156
- How we doing?
-I don't have it!

1157
01:00:13,535 --> 01:00:14,426
Come here,
give me a kiss!

1158
01:00:17,304 --> 01:00:18,837
Krieg! Pull back!

1159
01:00:29,281 --> 01:00:32,275
Go! Go!

1160
01:00:32,377 --> 01:00:34,248
I regret everything!

1161
01:00:41,393 --> 01:00:43,321
Come on!

1162
01:00:43,423 --> 01:00:45,196
-We gotta go.
- It's not working.

1163
01:00:45,298 --> 01:00:46,029
Go, Tannis.

1164
01:00:47,567 --> 01:00:49,362
We have another wiring problem.

1165
01:00:50,436 --> 01:00:51,499
Baby!

1166
01:00:53,966 --> 01:00:54,708
Shit.

1167
01:00:56,305 --> 01:00:58,542
- Roland, what are you doing?
-Fixing it.

1168
01:00:58,645 --> 01:01:00,038
- Get back here!
-Hey.

1169
01:01:00,140 --> 01:01:01,781
No. Please don't.

1170
01:01:03,285 --> 01:01:04,476
- Roland!
- Hey, Tina.

1171
01:01:06,454 --> 01:01:07,611
I'll meet you at the vault.

1172
01:01:08,255 --> 01:01:09,217
I promise.

1173
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,319
Tannis.

1174
01:01:13,460 --> 01:01:14,959
- Hit it!
- Okay, hitting!

1175
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:20,195
Roland!

1176
01:01:26,504 --> 01:01:28,231
All right, Bob.

1177
01:01:28,333 --> 01:01:30,343
You ready to kick some ass?

1178
01:01:30,445 --> 01:01:32,376
I knew you'd say that.

1179
01:02:12,052 --> 01:02:14,414
The brakes are out!
We are not slowing down!

1180
01:02:15,654 --> 01:02:16,680
We are not gonna make it!

1181
01:02:28,027 --> 01:02:29,668
Teleportation.

1182
01:02:29,770 --> 01:02:31,568
I can move stuff
with my mind, y'all.

1183
01:02:31,670 --> 01:02:32,635
We're not dead?

1184
01:02:32,737 --> 01:02:34,437
I'm still enslaved? Drats.

1185
01:02:36,108 --> 01:02:38,404
Chutney vomit queen.
Ew! Yuck!

1186
01:02:38,506 --> 01:02:40,972
I think the teleportation
has made her quite ill.

1187
01:02:41,074 --> 01:02:42,313
How did you do that?

1188
01:02:42,415 --> 01:02:43,976
I don't know.

1189
01:02:44,078 --> 01:02:45,948
Just kind of happened.

1190
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:48,013
Hey, Roland's
gonna be okay, right?

1191
01:02:48,115 --> 01:02:49,447
He's an elite soldier.

1192
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:51,825
If anyone can get out of that,
it's him.

1193
01:02:54,289 --> 01:02:55,527
Where are we?

1194
01:02:55,629 --> 01:02:57,862
I can't get a read on ECHOnet.

1195
01:02:57,964 --> 01:03:00,161
But it looks like
we're in an old mine.

1196
01:03:00,263 --> 01:03:02,660
Maybe we find
some shelter inside.

1197
01:03:26,726 --> 01:03:28,325
I've combined the keys.

1198
01:03:28,427 --> 01:03:29,423
Look.

1199
01:03:33,428 --> 01:03:35,193
What's that?
Some kind of a map?

1200
01:03:35,295 --> 01:03:36,694
Incredible, isn't it?

1201
01:03:37,735 --> 01:03:39,136
It isn't just a key.

1202
01:03:41,442 --> 01:03:42,669
And right there...

1203
01:03:42,772 --> 01:03:43,976
The vault?

1204
01:03:45,337 --> 01:03:46,371
It is a shame

1205
01:03:46,473 --> 01:03:48,145
your mother is not here
to see this.

1206
01:03:49,650 --> 01:03:51,514
It was there the whole time.

1207
01:03:51,616 --> 01:03:52,917
Apparently.

1208
01:03:53,019 --> 01:03:54,485
I've seen that
before somewhere.

1209
01:03:54,587 --> 01:03:55,853
Firehawk.

1210
01:03:55,955 --> 01:03:58,716
Eridian goddess,
protector of the planet.

1211
01:04:02,998 --> 01:04:06,163
Well, it's all a bit pointless
without the third piece.

1212
01:04:07,293 --> 01:04:08,462
Oh, well, we have it.

1213
01:04:12,538 --> 01:04:14,264
She's the key.

1214
01:04:14,366 --> 01:04:16,101
The elevator confirmed it.

1215
01:04:16,203 --> 01:04:17,609
That was a phasewalk.

1216
01:04:17,711 --> 01:04:19,245
Only an Eridian could do that.

1217
01:04:19,347 --> 01:04:20,403
Wait a minute.

1218
01:04:20,505 --> 01:04:21,613
If she's a piece of the key,

1219
01:04:21,715 --> 01:04:23,074
what happens when she opens it?

1220
01:04:23,176 --> 01:04:24,379
I assumed you knew.

1221
01:04:25,686 --> 01:04:27,050
Did your mother never tell you?

1222
01:04:27,153 --> 01:04:29,613
I was eight. I can barely
remember her face.

1223
01:04:29,715 --> 01:04:32,616
When the daughter of Eridia
places the key,

1224
01:04:32,718 --> 01:04:34,851
the pieces are consumed
and the vault opens.

1225
01:04:37,395 --> 01:04:41,129
Now, I don't necessarily
believe that means kill her.

1226
01:04:41,231 --> 01:04:42,699
But you're prepared
to take that risk.

1227
01:04:42,801 --> 01:04:44,366
Well, we have no choice.

1228
01:04:45,231 --> 01:04:46,767
Either we take her

1229
01:04:46,869 --> 01:04:48,238
or Atlas does.

1230
01:04:50,373 --> 01:04:52,275
There is no salvation
without sacrifice.

1231
01:05:03,655 --> 01:05:06,883
Worst orgy ever.

1232
01:05:19,672 --> 01:05:20,765
Rest in peace, Bob.

1233
01:05:31,848 --> 01:05:33,917
Oh, shit.

1234
01:05:45,864 --> 01:05:47,792
Whoa. Sorry.

1235
01:05:47,894 --> 01:05:49,668
I thought for a moment there
you had rigor mortis.

1236
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:51,196
It was a really nice moment.

1237
01:05:51,298 --> 01:05:52,971
I'll treasure it always.

1238
01:05:53,073 --> 01:05:55,167
Also, I scavenged
the final parts I needed

1239
01:05:55,269 --> 01:05:56,701
from a dead transformer,

1240
01:05:56,803 --> 01:05:59,738
and fixed the thing
you so recklessly destroyed.

1241
01:06:10,791 --> 01:06:12,456
You didn't press this, did you?

1242
01:06:12,559 --> 01:06:14,288
I did not.

1243
01:06:14,390 --> 01:06:15,952
I can crush it again
if you'd like.

1244
01:06:17,626 --> 01:06:20,163
Oh, "Thank you, Claptrap.
You're indispensable."

1245
01:06:20,266 --> 01:06:23,168
Thank you, Lilith.
Your praise warms my soul.

1246
01:06:46,691 --> 01:06:47,687
Lilith.

1247
01:06:49,360 --> 01:06:51,031
Have you broken the beacon
I gave you?

1248
01:06:54,430 --> 01:06:57,862
Ah, this thing was junk
the whole time.

1249
01:06:59,805 --> 01:07:01,039
Not at all.

1250
01:07:01,141 --> 01:07:03,843
It was a highly accurate
tracking device

1251
01:07:03,945 --> 01:07:06,536
that has led me
right to you and Tina.

1252
01:07:06,639 --> 01:07:07,704
Now, I was beginning to think

1253
01:07:07,806 --> 01:07:09,382
that she would
elude me forever.

1254
01:07:09,484 --> 01:07:10,614
She's smart.

1255
01:07:10,716 --> 01:07:12,679
She is mine.

1256
01:07:16,614 --> 01:07:17,715
And the Crimson Lance

1257
01:07:17,817 --> 01:07:18,958
are on their way
to collect her now.

1258
01:07:19,061 --> 01:07:20,723
If you come after her,
I'll destroy the key.

1259
01:07:20,825 --> 01:07:21,792
No, you won't.

1260
01:07:21,894 --> 01:07:23,525
Because if you did,

1261
01:07:25,558 --> 01:07:26,857
then I would have to kill

1262
01:07:26,959 --> 01:07:29,693
the rest of that heroic band
of vault hunters

1263
01:07:29,795 --> 01:07:31,770
she's been
slumming around with.

1264
01:07:31,872 --> 01:07:33,904
And I promise you, Lilith,

1265
01:07:34,006 --> 01:07:35,438
they won't be quick deaths.

1266
01:07:37,841 --> 01:07:39,178
Good.

1267
01:07:39,879 --> 01:07:41,243
Glad to see you making

1268
01:07:41,345 --> 01:07:43,545
the smart choice for once.

1269
01:07:44,917 --> 01:07:46,578
And when this is over,

1270
01:07:46,680 --> 01:07:48,253
you'll be paid
what we agreed on.

1271
01:07:50,823 --> 01:07:51,718
Thank you, Lilith.

1272
01:08:01,435 --> 01:08:03,629
Oh.

1273
01:08:03,732 --> 01:08:06,499
Tina, look, I know
how this must look, but...

1274
01:08:06,601 --> 01:08:09,208
I'm the only one
who can open the vault.

1275
01:08:11,245 --> 01:08:14,906
And I'm gonna use whatever
is inside to kill him.

1276
01:08:19,746 --> 01:08:21,413
Too bad you won't
be around to see it.

1277
01:08:21,515 --> 01:08:23,120
- Wait.
- Enjoy your freedom.

1278
01:08:23,222 --> 01:08:24,487
Tina. Tina, no!

1279
01:09:06,801 --> 01:09:07,530
I'm dancing because...

1280
01:09:08,735 --> 01:09:10,167
you're alive.

1281
01:09:10,269 --> 01:09:11,669
Not because
I thought you were dead.

1282
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:13,035
Heartwarming.

1283
01:09:13,137 --> 01:09:14,469
Where are the others?

1284
01:09:14,571 --> 01:09:15,904
They found a truck
in the village and left.

1285
01:09:16,006 --> 01:09:17,001
Without me.

1286
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:19,278
What village?

1287
01:09:22,679 --> 01:09:23,980
This must have
been one of the original

1288
01:09:24,082 --> 01:09:25,350
Pandoran settlements.

1289
01:09:25,983 --> 01:09:27,220
How quaint.

1290
01:09:29,856 --> 01:09:31,048
I know this place.

1291
01:09:48,474 --> 01:09:50,005
Come on.
Come on. Leave it.

1292
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:51,376
Come on, sweetie.

1293
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:54,779
Hurry, give me Lilith!

1294
01:09:54,881 --> 01:09:56,139
Come on! Come on!

1295
01:09:57,677 --> 01:09:59,377
Remember I will always love you!

1296
01:09:59,479 --> 01:10:00,220
Mama!

1297
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:02,552
No!

1298
01:10:10,890 --> 01:10:11,858
Hey,
where are you going?

1299
01:10:12,963 --> 01:10:13,926
Lilith.

1300
01:10:14,734 --> 01:10:15,499
Lilith!

1301
01:10:32,512 --> 01:10:34,113
Is this your home?

1302
01:10:34,215 --> 01:10:35,211
Yeah.

1303
01:10:36,187 --> 01:10:38,291
I used to live here once.

1304
01:10:54,007 --> 01:10:55,539
This place is...

1305
01:10:57,036 --> 01:10:59,873
reminiscent of something
deep in my files.

1306
01:11:03,245 --> 01:11:04,713
That drawing...

1307
01:11:06,614 --> 01:11:08,288
I feel strange.

1308
01:11:14,794 --> 01:11:15,790
Lilith.

1309
01:11:16,696 --> 01:11:17,495
Mom?

1310
01:11:18,933 --> 01:11:20,157
If you're seeing this...

1311
01:11:22,696 --> 01:11:23,930
I'm afraid I didn't make it.

1312
01:11:26,031 --> 01:11:28,873
I'm so sorry
that I sent you away.

1313
01:11:28,975 --> 01:11:30,442
I didn't want to.

1314
01:11:31,903 --> 01:11:33,878
But as soon as I realized

1315
01:11:33,980 --> 01:11:35,639
what you are,

1316
01:11:35,741 --> 01:11:37,009
what you might become...

1317
01:11:38,650 --> 01:11:41,420
I knew you'd never
be safe here on Pandora.

1318
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:44,784
But if you ever return,

1319
01:11:44,887 --> 01:11:47,756
I've made sure
that Claptrap will find you,

1320
01:11:48,787 --> 01:11:50,792
help you understand...

1321
01:11:51,998 --> 01:11:52,992
your destiny.

1322
01:11:57,972 --> 01:12:00,032
Lilith, I love you.

1323
01:12:10,081 --> 01:12:11,208
I wish...

1324
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:16,180
I could hold you one last time.

1325
01:12:27,702 --> 01:12:28,467
Tina!

1326
01:12:31,536 --> 01:12:34,168
Whoa.
That was weird.

1327
01:12:34,270 --> 01:12:36,272
I blacked out.

1328
01:12:36,374 --> 01:12:39,176
Did something important happen?

1329
01:13:04,831 --> 01:13:06,272
It's saying it's here.

1330
01:13:06,374 --> 01:13:07,764
All I'm seeing
is some holes.

1331
01:13:07,866 --> 01:13:09,439
Are you sure this is it?

1332
01:13:09,541 --> 01:13:10,770
I don't know.
It's somewhere.

1333
01:13:10,872 --> 01:13:12,208
Okay,
what does it look like?

1334
01:13:12,310 --> 01:13:14,172
Big. It's an arch.

1335
01:13:15,976 --> 01:13:17,942
It's here somewhere.
I know it's here.

1336
01:13:18,044 --> 01:13:19,042
How do you know it's here?

1337
01:13:19,144 --> 01:13:21,143
Because I'm feeling emotion.

1338
01:13:21,245 --> 01:13:22,585
Can you be more specific?

1339
01:13:22,688 --> 01:13:24,653
- Thing of power!
- Not right now, Krieg. Please.

1340
01:13:24,756 --> 01:13:26,759
- Okay, I get it...
- But that means something!

1341
01:13:26,861 --> 01:13:27,992
No, no, no!

1342
01:13:28,094 --> 01:13:29,462
I'm not following.

1343
01:13:44,277 --> 01:13:46,611
Krieg, you genius. You found it!

1344
01:14:04,762 --> 01:14:06,323
I have to warn you,
this might kill you.

1345
01:14:07,792 --> 01:14:09,200
Me?

1346
01:14:09,302 --> 01:14:12,196
Nah, kid. I'm the special one.

1347
01:14:12,298 --> 01:14:14,606
Whatever this is,
it's gonna make me invincible.

1348
01:14:46,931 --> 01:14:48,704
What just happened?

1349
01:14:48,806 --> 01:14:51,203
I'm the special one.
It should do something.

1350
01:14:55,312 --> 01:14:56,615
Apparently not.

1351
01:14:59,186 --> 01:15:00,685
Well done, Tina.

1352
01:15:01,285 --> 01:15:02,313
Well done.

1353
01:15:06,961 --> 01:15:07,857
Amazing effort.

1354
01:15:26,779 --> 01:15:28,678
You survived the worst planet
in the galaxy.

1355
01:15:28,780 --> 01:15:31,943
You found the key
and the vault itself.

1356
01:15:32,045 --> 01:15:33,916
You've made your father
so proud.

1357
01:15:37,321 --> 01:15:38,481
Commander Knoxx,

1358
01:15:39,888 --> 01:15:41,357
I need
her nervous system intact.

1359
01:15:41,459 --> 01:15:43,057
Keep the organs on ice.

1360
01:15:44,996 --> 01:15:47,061
Perhaps we'll have better luck
with the next clone.

1361
01:15:48,334 --> 01:15:49,668
Hey, asshole.

1362
01:15:58,336 --> 01:16:00,946
That was quite
an entrance, Roland.

1363
01:16:01,048 --> 01:16:02,306
You miss me?

1364
01:16:02,408 --> 01:16:04,441
You might have saved the day
if it wasn't for...

1365
01:16:05,978 --> 01:16:07,411
my Atlas auto shield.

1366
01:16:13,390 --> 01:16:14,819
Kill them all.

1367
01:16:20,529 --> 01:16:21,634
Hold your fire.

1368
01:16:22,234 --> 01:16:23,434
That's an order.

1369
01:16:23,536 --> 01:16:24,762
You heard the commander.

1370
01:16:24,864 --> 01:16:25,770
Weapons down.

1371
01:16:32,071 --> 01:16:32,975
Roland, you were right.

1372
01:16:35,247 --> 01:16:36,246
I should've...

1373
01:16:40,118 --> 01:16:41,347
No!

1374
01:16:41,449 --> 01:16:42,446
No!

1375
01:16:44,082 --> 01:16:45,383
Any other objections?

1376
01:16:46,292 --> 01:16:47,583
Just one!

1377
01:16:49,957 --> 01:16:52,130
That you continue breathing.

1378
01:16:52,232 --> 01:16:53,597
But I'll allow it

1379
01:16:53,699 --> 01:16:55,668
if you let my friends
go in peace.

1380
01:16:57,127 --> 01:16:58,500
And tell me, Lilith,

1381
01:16:58,602 --> 01:17:00,332
just why would I do that?

1382
01:17:03,576 --> 01:17:05,172
Because I'm the daughter
of Eridia.

1383
01:17:07,075 --> 01:17:08,806
I've seen that
before somewhere.

1384
01:17:08,908 --> 01:17:09,939
Firehawk.

1385
01:17:10,041 --> 01:17:11,315
Eridian goddess.

1386
01:17:11,417 --> 01:17:12,751
It's your planet, Lilith.

1387
01:17:13,617 --> 01:17:14,813
You have to protect it.

1388
01:17:14,915 --> 01:17:16,687
Mama loved you.

1389
01:17:16,789 --> 01:17:19,048
She always told me
how special you were.

1390
01:17:19,150 --> 01:17:21,286
I found it.

1391
01:17:21,388 --> 01:17:22,391
How did...?
I don't know.

1392
01:17:22,493 --> 01:17:24,290
Just lucky, I guess.

1393
01:17:28,998 --> 01:17:30,500
Daughter of Eridia, baby!

1394
01:17:30,602 --> 01:17:32,203
Bet you didn't see that coming!

1395
01:17:34,976 --> 01:17:35,966
But...

1396
01:17:36,068 --> 01:17:36,973
But I'm the special one.

1397
01:17:38,310 --> 01:17:39,338
Oh, you are.

1398
01:17:40,513 --> 01:17:41,681
Just not the way you thought.

1399
01:17:43,316 --> 01:17:44,310
I open the vault...

1400
01:17:45,483 --> 01:17:46,312
the girl goes free.

1401
01:17:49,014 --> 01:17:50,848
You open the vault

1402
01:17:50,950 --> 01:17:52,384
and you all go free.

1403
01:17:53,359 --> 01:17:54,518
You have my word.

1404
01:17:56,628 --> 01:17:58,560
I just figured it out.

1405
01:17:58,662 --> 01:18:01,399
Your mother gave you to me

1406
01:18:01,501 --> 01:18:02,931
to take you away from here,

1407
01:18:03,033 --> 01:18:05,529
so you would never
have to open that vault.

1408
01:18:05,631 --> 01:18:06,871
Well, that worked out great.

1409
01:18:08,605 --> 01:18:10,006
I have to open it.

1410
01:18:13,304 --> 01:18:15,112
No salvation without sacrifice.

1411
01:18:15,215 --> 01:18:16,243
Remember?

1412
01:18:17,613 --> 01:18:18,641
But you can't.

1413
01:18:19,186 --> 01:18:20,183
You can't.

1414
01:18:20,286 --> 01:18:21,644
It's fine.

1415
01:18:22,222 --> 01:18:23,316
You're safe.

1416
01:18:24,488 --> 01:18:25,483
And, Tina,

1417
01:18:26,492 --> 01:18:28,351
memories are more powerful

1418
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:31,296
than anything
Atlas could ever create.

1419
01:18:31,398 --> 01:18:33,925
Now, you got one of me.

1420
01:19:49,274 --> 01:19:50,601
Yes.

1421
01:20:03,787 --> 01:20:05,380
Tannis, what's happening?

1422
01:20:05,482 --> 01:20:07,225
The Eridians have delivered us

1423
01:20:07,327 --> 01:20:08,987
a champion.

1424
01:20:25,479 --> 01:20:27,136
The legends were true.

1425
01:20:27,238 --> 01:20:28,413
She's the Firehawk.

1426
01:20:28,515 --> 01:20:30,014
Lilith, can you hear me?

1427
01:20:31,782 --> 01:20:34,711
Take me into the vault.

1428
01:20:34,813 --> 01:20:36,955
If you won't, I'm going
to have to hurt your friends.

1429
01:20:41,625 --> 01:20:42,592
Pull me up!

1430
01:20:42,694 --> 01:20:43,687
Lilith, help!

1431
01:21:04,212 --> 01:21:06,182
Make it rain, Tina!

1432
01:21:14,294 --> 01:21:15,359
Attack!

1433
01:21:20,699 --> 01:21:21,930
Are you guys shooting?

1434
01:21:22,032 --> 01:21:23,394
I'm sorry,
I didn't feel a thing.

1435
01:21:23,496 --> 01:21:24,268
You get a bullet.
You get a bullet.

1436
01:21:24,371 --> 01:21:25,597
Run, run.

1437
01:21:32,706 --> 01:21:34,606
Interplanetary
ninja assassin mode activated.

1438
01:21:36,474 --> 01:21:38,777
Step aside, bitches.

1439
01:22:31,636 --> 01:22:33,896
Lilith. Lilith!

1440
01:22:35,737 --> 01:22:36,976
No!

1441
01:22:37,776 --> 01:22:39,572
Lilith, can you hear me?

1442
01:22:47,953 --> 01:22:49,285
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

1443
01:22:54,321 --> 01:22:56,787
Lilith. Come on, Lilith.

1444
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:05,202
Lilith.

1445
01:23:06,396 --> 01:23:07,336
Please wake up.

1446
01:23:08,839 --> 01:23:10,537
Tannis, run.

1447
01:23:53,017 --> 01:23:55,648
Nobody kills me but me!

1448
01:24:10,528 --> 01:24:12,269
Everybody, run!

1449
01:24:20,747 --> 01:24:21,740
Go! Move, move!

1450
01:24:29,688 --> 01:24:30,452
Shit!

1451
01:24:52,109 --> 01:24:53,475
Tannis, you're alive.

1452
01:24:54,009 --> 01:24:55,779
I'm alive!

1453
01:24:55,881 --> 01:24:57,413
This guy, not so much.

1454
01:25:05,954 --> 01:25:06,953
A siren.

1455
01:25:07,055 --> 01:25:08,050
Tina!

1456
01:25:08,561 --> 01:25:09,557
Tina!

1457
01:25:10,563 --> 01:25:11,559
Tina!

1458
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:17,235
Tannis, where's Tina?

1459
01:25:17,802 --> 01:25:18,797
Lilith!

1460
01:25:20,975 --> 01:25:23,004
I warned you
not to disappoint me.

1461
01:25:23,106 --> 01:25:25,609
Take me to the vault now.

1462
01:25:46,800 --> 01:25:48,926
Well, shit.

1463
01:26:00,009 --> 01:26:01,836
Let go of me!

1464
01:26:01,938 --> 01:26:03,182
Keep struggling
and I'll kill you.

1465
01:26:08,984 --> 01:26:10,846
Lilith!

1466
01:26:10,948 --> 01:26:12,015
Lilith, show yourself!

1467
01:26:13,784 --> 01:26:15,293
Show yourself or I kill her!

1468
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:17,625
I'll do it!

1469
01:26:18,522 --> 01:26:19,658
Believe me.

1470
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:20,958
Oh, I believe you.

1471
01:26:22,494 --> 01:26:23,730
Ah, Lilith.

1472
01:26:25,496 --> 01:26:26,238
This is...

1473
01:26:30,006 --> 01:26:31,375
unbelievable.

1474
01:26:34,543 --> 01:26:36,842
So much more
than I ever imagined.

1475
01:26:40,013 --> 01:26:43,587
The treasures of a race
who once ruled the galaxies.

1476
01:26:43,689 --> 01:26:44,685
Look.

1477
01:26:47,158 --> 01:26:49,261
The power. Can you feel it?

1478
01:26:50,059 --> 01:26:51,494
Can you...

1479
01:26:53,901 --> 01:26:55,597
Yeah, I can feel it.

1480
01:26:56,895 --> 01:26:59,771
Honestly, it makes me
a little sick.

1481
01:26:59,873 --> 01:27:01,597
You'll get used to it.

1482
01:27:01,699 --> 01:27:03,198
Yeah. You see...

1483
01:27:03,300 --> 01:27:06,168
I have something that a man
like you will never have.

1484
01:27:08,978 --> 01:27:09,941
Enough.

1485
01:27:13,251 --> 01:27:14,418
Lilith.
Over here.

1486
01:27:16,756 --> 01:27:17,655
Lose something?

1487
01:27:19,560 --> 01:27:20,556
Tina!

1488
01:27:27,031 --> 01:27:27,794
Ta-da.

1489
01:27:31,936 --> 01:27:33,000
Bye-bye.

1490
01:27:33,102 --> 01:27:34,831
No, Lilith.

1491
01:27:34,933 --> 01:27:35,934
- Lilith, please.
-Don't worry.

1492
01:27:37,274 --> 01:27:38,904
You won't get lonely down here.

1493
01:27:40,746 --> 01:27:41,976
No. No.

1494
01:27:42,078 --> 01:27:43,813
No, no, no. No!

1495
01:27:43,915 --> 01:27:45,383
Lilith! Tina!

1496
01:27:46,049 --> 01:27:48,582
No, no, no!

1497
01:28:15,279 --> 01:28:16,414
♪ It's like sugar ♪

1498
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:18,614
♪ So sweet ♪

1499
01:28:24,224 --> 01:28:26,055
Excuse me!
Coming through.

1500
01:28:26,157 --> 01:28:27,986
Make way for the hero!

1501
01:28:32,126 --> 01:28:33,555
Hey.

1502
01:28:33,657 --> 01:28:34,432
You hear that?

1503
01:28:35,295 --> 01:28:36,662
What?

1504
01:28:36,764 --> 01:28:40,262
That I think is what
peace sounds like.

1505
01:28:43,008 --> 01:28:44,035
Enjoy it.

1506
01:28:45,076 --> 01:28:46,174
Let's make it last.

1507
01:28:46,276 --> 01:28:47,872
I made you a little tea.

1508
01:28:47,974 --> 01:28:49,843
I thought you might be
a little dehydrated.

1509
01:29:21,213 --> 01:29:22,947
All right, guys. Let's, um...

1510
01:29:23,049 --> 01:29:24,213
Let's join the party.

1511
01:29:24,315 --> 01:29:27,084
All right! Hooray!

1512
01:29:27,186 --> 01:29:30,178
Whoops. Premature celebration.

1513
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,546
That's never happened before.

1514
01:29:31,649 --> 01:29:32,688
You ready?

1515
01:29:34,060 --> 01:29:35,121
We'll meet you there.

1516
01:29:35,224 --> 01:29:36,893
I got you.

1517
01:29:36,995 --> 01:29:37,962
Come on, Krieg.

1518
01:29:38,064 --> 01:29:39,063
Time to go get drunk.

1519
01:29:39,165 --> 01:29:41,092
Glorious meat fiesta.

1520
01:29:44,870 --> 01:29:45,602
So...

1521
01:29:47,169 --> 01:29:48,165
Uh...

1522
01:29:49,140 --> 01:29:50,574
I don't think so.

1523
01:29:51,339 --> 01:29:52,942
Come on.

1524
01:29:53,044 --> 01:29:53,874
Do the thing.

1525
01:29:56,379 --> 01:29:58,108
I'm a bit old, I think,

1526
01:29:58,210 --> 01:30:00,952
to be setting myself on fire
for your amusement.

1527
01:30:01,054 --> 01:30:02,212
You know you want to.

1528
01:30:05,721 --> 01:30:06,717
Let me
tell you everything

1529
01:30:06,819 --> 01:30:09,087
you need to know about Pandora.

1530
01:30:10,062 --> 01:30:10,795
She's dangerous.

1531
01:30:10,897 --> 01:30:12,286
She's dirty.

1532
01:30:12,389 --> 01:30:14,763
And she's definitely
a toxic waste dump.

1533
01:30:16,234 --> 01:30:17,931
But, she's my home.

1534
01:30:23,934 --> 01:30:25,510

I come to dance, mofo.

1554
01:32:36,133 --> 01:32:37,736
Twerk it. Work it out, now.

Do the Claptrap. It's my...

Oh, hey! Hey, wait! No, no, no!

1557
01:32:40,510 --> 01:32:42,079
What's goin' on here? No!

1558
01:32:42,181 --> 01:32:43,113
It's my Easter egg!

1559
01:32:43,215 --> 01:32:44,444
Ah! You son of a...

1560
01:32:44,546 --> 01:32:46,440
Don't make me leave!

1561

Not when I'm giving the people
what they want!
