1
00:00:49,716 --> 00:00:52,651
<i>Greece and the islands</i>
<i>of the Aegean Sea...</i>

2
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,655
<i>have given birth to many myths</i>
<i>and legends of war and adventure.</i>

3
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:01,152
<i>These once-proud stones...</i>

4
00:01:01,227 --> 00:01:03,855
<i>these ruined and shattered temples...</i>

5
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,367
<i>bear witness to the civilization that</i>
<i>flourished and then died here...</i>

6
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,732
<i>and to the demigods and heroes</i>
<i>who inspired those legends...</i>

7
00:01:14,808 --> 00:01:17,470
<i>on this sea and these islands.</i>

8
00:01:17,544 --> 00:01:22,004
<i>But, though the stage is the same,</i>
<i>ours is a legend of our own times...</i>

9
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:26,610
<i>and its heroes are not demigods,</i>
<i>but ordinary people.</i>

10
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,814
<i>In 1943, so the story goes...</i>

11
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:33,848
<i>2,000 British soldiers lay marooned</i>
<i>on the tiny island of Kheros...</i>

12
00:01:33,927 --> 00:01:36,054
<i>exhausted and helpless.</i>

13
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,163
<i>They had exactly</i>
<i>one week to live...</i>

14
00:01:39,232 --> 00:01:41,632
<i>for the Axis high command</i>
<i>had determined...</i>

15
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,135
<i>on a show of strength</i>
<i>in the Aegean Sea...</i>

16
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:47,731
<i>to bully neutral Turkey into</i>
<i>coming into the war on their side.</i>

17
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,871
<i>The scene of that demonstration</i>
<i>was to be Kheros...</i>

18
00:01:53,947 --> 00:01:59,010
<i>itself of no military value, but only</i>
<i>a few miles off the coast of Turkey.</i>

19
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:03,283
<i>The cream of the German war machine,</i>
<i>rested and ready...</i>

20
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:05,756
<i>was to spearhead the attack...</i>

21
00:02:05,825 --> 00:02:08,589
<i>and the men on Kheros were doomed...</i>

22
00:02:08,661 --> 00:02:11,596
<i>unless they could be evacuated</i>
<i>before the blitz.</i>

23
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:15,327
<i>But the only passage to and from</i>
<i>Kheros was guarded and blocked...</i>

24
00:02:15,401 --> 00:02:18,893
<i>by two great, newly designed,</i>
<i>radar-controlled guns...</i>

25
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:21,739
<i>on the nearby island of Navarone.</i>

26
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:30,078
<i>Guns too powerful and accurate for any</i>
<i>Allied ship in the Aegean to challenge.</i>

27
00:02:41,594 --> 00:02:44,290
<i>Allied intelligence learned</i>
<i>of the projected blitz...</i>

28
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:46,958
<i>only one week</i>
<i>before the appointed date.</i>

29
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:50,764
<i>What took place in the next six days</i>
<i>became the legend of Navarone.</i>

30
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:06,924
Yes?

31
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,434
Sorry. I'm looking
for Commodore Jensen.

32
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:10,992
I'm Jensen.

33
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:13,333
Come in, Mallory.

34
00:06:16,175 --> 00:06:18,166
You're late.

35
00:06:22,615 --> 00:06:24,549
Well, I'm sorry.

36
00:06:24,617 --> 00:06:29,077
My plane was attacked outside of Crete
and we got into Alex on one engine, sir.

37
00:06:29,155 --> 00:06:33,182
The Germans have raised the price on you
and Andrea Stavrou to Â£10,000 apiece.

38
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:36,194
- Are you flattered?
- No, sir. How did you know that?

39
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,287
I should do.
I'm your boss.

40
00:06:38,364 --> 00:06:41,458
You've been working for me
for the past 18 months.

41
00:06:42,201 --> 00:06:44,931
I'm delighted to make your acquaintance
at long last.

42
00:06:45,004 --> 00:06:48,337
- They told you you were going on leave?
- Yes, sir, they did.

43
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,138
I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that's not true.

44
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:53,303
Not yet, at any rate.

45
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,913
Well, here's your old chum.
Come say hello.

46
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,144
Keith, you haven't changed
since Athens.

47
00:06:59,719 --> 00:07:01,653
Hello, Roy.

48
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:03,655
Come along, gentlemen, will you.

49
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:16,662
Barnsby, these gentlemen have
a special interest in Navarone.

50
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:21,673
We picked you up on radio, of course,
but you can be more specific now.

51
00:07:23,342 --> 00:07:25,276
I'll be specific.

52
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:27,904
As you can plainly see,
it was bloody awful.

53
00:07:28,714 --> 00:07:30,375
Squadron Leader Barnsby
is Australian.

54
00:07:31,918 --> 00:07:34,853
But we'd love to go back.
Wouldn't we, boys?

55
00:07:34,921 --> 00:07:37,355
- Sure!
- Just as soon as we can, but...

56
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,692
only on one condition.

57
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:44,719
We want the joker who thought
this one up to come along with us.

58
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:47,231
And when we get there...

59
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,792
we're gonna shove him out
at 10,000 feet...

60
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,565
without a parachute.

61
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,570
- It was as bad as that?
- Bad?

62
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,245
It can't be done.
Not from the air, anyway.

63
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:03,248
You're quite sure about that,
Squadron Leader?

64
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:06,080
- This is important.
- So's my life.

65
00:08:06,152 --> 00:08:07,585
To me, anyway.

66
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,589
And the lives of these jokers here,
and the 18 men we lost tonight.

67
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,595
Look, sir...

68
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,528
first...

69
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,467
you've got that bloody old fortress
on top of that bloody cliff.

70
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,096
Then you got
the bloody cliff overhang.

71
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:30,609
You can't even see the bloody cave,
let alone the bloody guns.

72
00:08:30,676 --> 00:08:34,168
And anyway, we haven't got
a bloody bomb big enough...

73
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,216
to smash that bloody rock.

74
00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,251
And that's the bloody truth, sir.

75
00:08:42,255 --> 00:08:45,190
- I know how to hit those guns, sir.
- Yes?

76
00:08:45,258 --> 00:08:46,953
Yes, sir.

77
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,824
You fill a plane full of TNT...

78
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:54,890
and then you do a suicide dive
right into that cave.

79
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,458
There's just one problem, sir.

80
00:08:57,537 --> 00:08:59,471
Getting someone to pilot the plane.

81
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,342
I see.

82
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,344
Perhaps you might
consider it yourself.

83
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:11,513
Thank you, Squadron Leader,
and all of you.

84
00:09:11,584 --> 00:09:16,521
I know you've done your best,
and nobody could have done more...

85
00:09:16,589 --> 00:09:18,523
and I'm sorry.

86
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,465
As you've probably surmised,
Mallory...

87
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:30,764
I'm the bloody joker
they'd like to heave out at 10,000 feet.

88
00:09:30,836 --> 00:09:32,770
I can't say I blame them.

89
00:09:32,838 --> 00:09:36,330
I knew it was hopeless from the start,
but it had to be tried.

90
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:39,503
Anyway, this is why
you were hauled out of Crete.

91
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,143
And don't mislay this, will you?

92
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:48,516
No, sir.

93
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:52,024
Well, we're pressed for time.
Let's go, gentlemen, shall we?

94
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:07,671
- Any questions?
- Well, only one.

95
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:10,174
Why me?

96
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,546
What you want
is a seagoing taxi driver.

97
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:17,549
There must be a dozen men
who know these waters as well as I do.

98
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:20,051
Yes, but you've got
special qualifications.

99
00:10:20,119 --> 00:10:23,179
Franklin will explain it to you.
It's all his idea anyway.

100
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,713
First, you speak Greek like a Greek
and German like a German.

101
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,956
Second, you've kept alive in occupied
territory for a year and a half.

102
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,463
But most important...

103
00:10:32,531 --> 00:10:35,762
before the war you were the greatest
mountain climber in the world.

104
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,030
Keith Mallory, the human fly.

105
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:39,435
Come to the point.

106
00:10:39,505 --> 00:10:43,373
The point is,
our Resistance contacts on Navarone...

107
00:10:43,442 --> 00:10:47,378
say there's only one spot on the entire
coast the Germans don't bother watching.

108
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:48,970
That's the south cliff...

109
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:53,747
because it's 400 feet straight up
and it can't be climbed by man or beast.

110
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,253
That's where you come in.

111
00:10:56,322 --> 00:11:00,258
- Oh, that was your idea too, was it?
- That's right.

112
00:11:00,326 --> 00:11:04,888
I want you to get me and my team
over there and on top of that cliff.

113
00:11:04,964 --> 00:11:08,730
After that, you can put your ship about
and take a richly deserved leave...

114
00:11:08,801 --> 00:11:11,429
and a long-overdue promotion.

115
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:13,096
I see.

116
00:11:30,556 --> 00:11:31,989
Can you do it?

117
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,127
With all due respect to Major Franklin,
I think the operation is insane.

118
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,430
But that's none of my business.

119
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:47,438
My business is the climb, and I haven't
done any climbing in five years.

120
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:52,473
That's a long time.
Too long for this cliff.

121
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:55,480
And you're asking me
to do it at night.

122
00:11:59,285 --> 00:12:02,345
I wouldn't try it in broad daylight.

123
00:12:02,421 --> 00:12:05,049
I'll have a go at it myself, then.

124
00:12:05,124 --> 00:12:06,819
Don't be a fool.

125
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,827
Even with your luck, you'll
get yourself and your team killed.

126
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,157
Then it's scrubbed?

127
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:14,165
No, it's not scrubbed.
It can't be.

128
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,535
Not now.

129
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:24,909
This is our last hope.

130
00:12:24,977 --> 00:12:29,539
The Germans won't expect us to throw in
a team of saboteurs at this late date.

131
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:34,044
Those 2,000 men on Kheros are
going to die next Wednesday morning...

132
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:36,088
unless somebody climbs that cliff.

133
00:12:36,155 --> 00:12:39,420
There's nobody else we can get
in time.

134
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,996
If there were,
you wouldn't be here now.

135
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:04,541
I suppose it's too late to get
Andrea Stavrou out of Crete to help me.

136
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:06,377
On the contrary.

137
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:10,616
You'll find him waiting for you
in your hotel at this very moment.

138
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,359
You think of everything,
don't you, sir?

139
00:13:15,427 --> 00:13:18,123
I have to.
It's part of my job.

140
00:13:18,197 --> 00:13:21,098
- Thanks, Keith.
- It's my pleasure.

141
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:24,102
Nothing I like better
than a well-organized setup.

142
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,105
Now, you'll want to know some more
about the team.

143
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:30,609
Sidney, would you get us
some more coffee, please?

144
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,806
Franklin here considers it the best team
in the business; I'm inclined to agree.

145
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,283
He himself is ideal for the job.
He's experienced and extremely capable.

146
00:13:39,351 --> 00:13:41,285
Don't blush, Roy.

147
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,083
And best of all, he's lucky.
Aren't you?

148
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:46,784
- If you say so, sir.
- I do indeed.

149
00:13:46,859 --> 00:13:50,420
It was Napoleon who said, when somebody
was being promoted to general...

150
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:53,488
"Yes, yes, I know he's brilliant,
but is he lucky?"

151
00:13:53,566 --> 00:13:57,229
The emperor knew the value of luck,
and our Roy seems to have it.

152
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:00,568
- Then make me a general, sir.
- Patience, my dear boy, patience.

153
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:03,767
This is our Corporal Miller...

154
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,004
a professor of chemistry
in private life...

155
00:14:06,078 --> 00:14:08,774
and an absolute genius
with high explosives.

156
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:10,816
He blew up Rommel's headquarters
in Tobruk...

157
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,818
without damaging a single window
of the orphanage next door.

158
00:14:13,886 --> 00:14:17,413
They don't come any better. We tried to
promote him, but he just won't wear it.

159
00:14:18,224 --> 00:14:21,193
This is Butcher Brown,
our mechanical marvel.

160
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,752
He's a genius with engines,
machinery, radios, et cetera.

161
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:27,765
He's also the best man with a knife
that I've ever met.

162
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:32,770
He got trained in the Spanish Civil War.
They call him the Butcher of Barcelona.

163
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:37,008
Private Spiro Pappadimos.

164
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:41,979
What's his particular genius?

165
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:46,814
He's a born killer, an extremely useful
man to have along on a job like this.

166
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:51,823
His father happens to be our
chief Resistance contact on Navarone.

167
00:14:51,891 --> 00:14:55,327
The family sent him to America
ten years ago to get an education...

168
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:57,794
and I'm afraid
he got the wrong kind.

169
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,490
Well, there's the team.

170
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:02,363
Pirates and cutthroats,
every one of them.

171
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:06,393
And of course there's Lucky here,
and the redoubtable Mr. Stavrou...

172
00:15:06,472 --> 00:15:07,734
and yourself.

173
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,566
With every one of us a genius,
how can we fail?

174
00:15:11,644 --> 00:15:13,305
You can't.

175
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:17,145
We're sending six destroyers through
Navarone Channel Tuesday at midnight...

176
00:15:17,216 --> 00:15:19,150
to take the men off Kheros.

177
00:15:19,218 --> 00:15:21,652
If those guns aren't spiked by then...

178
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,211
there'll be six more ships
at the bottom of the Aegean.

179
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:31,229
There's your car, gentlemen.

180
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:47,941
Surprised?

181
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:51,682
I did not think
I would see you again so soon.

182
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:53,843
You thought
you'd have to look for me?

183
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,884
When the time came,
I would find you.

184
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:02,188
What is it?

185
00:16:04,863 --> 00:16:08,299
We have to ferry some operators
to an island called Navarone.

186
00:16:09,768 --> 00:16:13,033
- Do you know it?
- I know it.

187
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,871
I also know
I have work to do on Crete.

188
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:20,036
- Who's responsible for this?
- A major that I used to know.

189
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,314
Name of Franklin.

190
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:26,317
He's a man who still has
to prove to himself that he's a hero.

191
00:16:27,619 --> 00:16:30,952
I will speak to this Franklin.
Where do I find him?

192
00:16:32,091 --> 00:16:33,683
That's the man.

193
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:37,294
You can speak with him on the way.

194
00:16:50,509 --> 00:16:53,444
Do you think they've got
any chance at all, sir?

195
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:55,002
Frankly, no.

196
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:57,514
Not a chance in the world.

197
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,446
I should be very surprised
if they get even halfway to Navarone.

198
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:06,286
It's just a waste of six good men.

199
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:08,383
However,
I suppose that doesn't matter...

200
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:11,395
considering how many
have been wasted already.

201
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:17,831
I'm glad it's not my decision.

202
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:19,837
I'm only the middle man.

203
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:27,577
Still, they may get there
and they may pull it off.

204
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,580
Anything can happen in a war.

205
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,707
Slap in the middle
of absolute insanity...

206
00:17:31,784 --> 00:17:34,378
people pull out
the most extraordinary resources--

207
00:17:34,453 --> 00:17:37,650
ingenuity, courage, self-sacrifice.

208
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:41,726
Pity we can't beat the problems of peace
in the same way.

209
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,526
It would be so much cheaper
for everybody.

210
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:48,532
I never thought of it
in just that way, sir.

211
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,899
- You're a philosopher, sir.
- No.

212
00:17:52,838 --> 00:17:56,501
I'm just the man who has to send people
out on jobs like this one.

213
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:38,008
Must've been delayed, sir.
I'm sure he'll be here in a moment.

214
00:18:57,503 --> 00:18:59,095
- Major Franklin?
- That's right.

215
00:18:59,171 --> 00:19:02,607
My name's Baker. Sorry I was delayed.
Come along with me.

216
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:04,904
It's been so comfortable,
I hate to leave.

217
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:11,574
When you're all quite ready.

218
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:34,904
Charming.
Just like an English country hotel.

219
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,907
Where does everybody else sleep?

220
00:19:36,975 --> 00:19:39,569
Nobody sleeps. On your feet.
We've got homework to do.

221
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:41,977
Well, if you insist, Major.

222
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:46,308
What are you doing, friend?
Looking for dust?

223
00:19:46,385 --> 00:19:47,977
No, friend, microphones.

224
00:19:48,053 --> 00:19:50,988
This is the British army post.
Don't you trust anyone?

225
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:53,991
No. That is why
I have lived so long.

226
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,292
Mr. Stavrou is Colonel Stavrou
of the Greek 19th Motorized Regiment.

227
00:19:59,364 --> 00:20:01,298
He outranks us all.

228
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:04,631
The 19th Regiment no longer exists...

229
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,136
for the time being.

230
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,800
- I beg your pardon, Colonel.
- Andrea.

231
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,207
- Oh, please continue.
- Right.

232
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:14,438
If you're ready, Corporal.

233
00:20:14,513 --> 00:20:17,710
Oh, yes, sir. Ready, sir.
Ready, willing and able, sir.

234
00:20:18,784 --> 00:20:20,342
Champing at the very bit.

235
00:20:20,419 --> 00:20:23,149
Captain Mallory and, uh, Andrea...

236
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:26,157
are responsible for getting us
to where we're going.

237
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:29,160
I'm going to tell you where we're going
and why we're going there.

238
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:32,163
That is, if you really
want to know, Professor.

239
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,529
I'm all ears, sir.
All ears.

240
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,534
We have to avoid the coast road.

241
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:40,834
That means a 12-mile trek across the
mountain to these ruins-- St. Alexis--

242
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,875
where some of the Resistance people
from the town of Mandrakos...

243
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:46,877
will come and meet us,
if and when they can make it.

244
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:49,004
Any questions?

245
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:53,177
I have an alternate route to that place.
May I borrow your pencil, please?

246
00:20:57,956 --> 00:21:00,516
Does the major
think this is possible?

247
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:03,527
I see.
That's a thought, isn't it?

248
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:06,126
Let's reexamine the plan...

249
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,632
and see if we have any alternative.

250
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:12,058
Watch out!

251
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,309
How long do you think
he's been out there?

252
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:20,641
I imagined I heard something
about ten minutes ago.

253
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,306
I thought my ears were playing tricks.
Then I heard it again.

254
00:21:23,382 --> 00:21:26,613
Ten minutes, eh?
Brown, go and get Major Baker.

255
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,654
Well? What's your name?
What are you doing here?

256
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,948
The major asked you a question.
Answer the major.

257
00:21:38,330 --> 00:21:40,924
Sounds like Kurdish.
I don't understand it.

258
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:42,557
I'll try Greek.

259
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:52,309
Translation, sir, please.

260
00:21:52,377 --> 00:21:55,403
- He doesn't speak English.
- Then why was he listening?

261
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,417
- What are you doing to that man?
- Do you know him?

262
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:04,319
That's Nikolai, our laundry boy.
Is he the reason I've been disturbed?

263
00:22:04,389 --> 00:22:06,323
Look, Franklin,
I've had a hard day.

264
00:22:06,391 --> 00:22:08,484
Does his job involve
listening at keyholes?

265
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,551
- I don't believe it.
- We caught him.

266
00:22:10,629 --> 00:22:13,564
Just idle curiosity, I'm sure.
He doesn't speak English.

267
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:17,261
Then why does he listen? Why carry a
knife? Why did he try and stab this man?

268
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,770
I presume he was trying
to defend himself.

269
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:24,707
In this part of the world, carrying a
knife doesn't mark a man as a criminal.

270
00:22:24,776 --> 00:22:27,074
- You there, let him go.
- Major Baker.

271
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:31,411
Arrest this man and hold him
incommunicado for at least a week.

272
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:34,850
After that I don't care, but my advice
is you kick him out of Castelrosso.

273
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:37,753
Just who the hell are you
to give me advice, Major?

274
00:22:39,324 --> 00:22:42,259
Then I'm asking you as a favor.

275
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,158
I'll consider it.

276
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,288
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.

277
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,457
I said, let him go!

278
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,466
Pappadimos, have you got your silencer?

279
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:51,092
- Yes, sir.
- Good. Then use it.

280
00:22:51,169 --> 00:22:53,296
- Shoot the laundry boy.
- Are you crazy?

281
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:57,672
And if the major gets in your way,
shoot him too. That's an order.

282
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:10,751
Captain, this man's insane.
Surely you won't let him do this.

283
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:13,985
I can't stop him. He's in charge.
Anyway, I agree with him.

284
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,994
Of course,
he doesn't have to shoot you.

285
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,395
All he has to do is call our HQ
and you'll be on the first ship home...

286
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,160
as a private...

287
00:23:24,703 --> 00:23:28,833
unless you give him your word
that you'll do exactly as he says.

288
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:41,379
All right. If it means that much to you,
you have my word.

289
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:43,387
Take him, Sergeant.

290
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:48,388
Stupid theatricals.

291
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:51,428
Well, you're entitled
to your opinion...

292
00:23:51,496 --> 00:23:54,158
but I just saved your life.

293
00:24:15,854 --> 00:24:18,186
I'm desperately sorry, gentlemen.

294
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:21,851
I mean, it's embarrassing.
Just look at it.

295
00:24:21,927 --> 00:24:23,861
No, it's exactly what we want.

296
00:24:23,929 --> 00:24:28,093
I know you wanted a boat that no one
would notice, but that's a disgrace.

297
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:31,201
Just give me 36 hours.

298
00:24:31,269 --> 00:24:35,831
I know where I can lay my hands on
a German E-boat in perfect condition.

299
00:24:35,907 --> 00:24:40,674
Only one careful owner. Say the word,
I'll pop over to Rhodes and get it.

300
00:24:40,745 --> 00:24:43,680
Rhodes? Won't the Germans
have something to say about that?

301
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:47,548
I suppose they would if they knew, but
I've got some good connections there.

302
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:49,553
- What do you say?
- No, thanks.

303
00:24:49,621 --> 00:24:51,145
- We can't wait.
- Pity.

304
00:24:51,223 --> 00:24:54,488
Well, I'll get a couple of my chaps
to give yours a hand with your gear.

305
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,153
No, that's all right, thank you.

306
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,995
Right. I get it.
Special cargo and all that, what?

307
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:03,660
Well, good luck to you.

308
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:12,143
Brown?

309
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:14,144
- Yes, sir?
- What do you think?

310
00:25:16,214 --> 00:25:19,843
She's a bit of a monster, sir,
but I think I've got her worried.

311
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,455
Comfortable, Professor?

312
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:27,082
Yes, thank you.

313
00:25:27,158 --> 00:25:29,422
The boys have almost finished.

314
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,163
- Permission to speak?
- What about?

315
00:25:33,231 --> 00:25:35,165
Well, the condition of this vessel.

316
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:40,131
Talk to Captain Mallory about that.
He's in charge of transportation.

317
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:41,467
Very good, sir.

318
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:46,275
I've inspected this boat,
and you ought to know that...

319
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:47,606
I can't swim.

320
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,613
I'll keep it in mind.

321
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:09,659
Dead on ten, sir.

322
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,537
<i>Hello, Lucky.</i>
<i>Hello, Lucky.</i>

Strength three. Over.

326
00:26:27,085 --> 00:26:28,609
<i>Hello, Lucky.</i>

00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:40,559
<i>Repeat</i>--

331
00:27:59,978 --> 00:28:01,570
Ship ahoy!

332
00:28:10,021 --> 00:28:12,455
Go on working.
They'll have glasses.

333
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,038
Lower your sails!

334
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:13,409
Lower your sails!

335
00:29:13,485 --> 00:29:15,817
We are coming aboard!

336
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:31,267
It's knee-deep in the hold,
but I should think we'll manage.

337
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:35,111
- You want a breather?
- Wouldn't mind.

338
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:46,389
Funny the way that German officer
kept speaking English to us back there.

339
00:33:47,592 --> 00:33:50,186
Almost as if he knew who we were.

340
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:52,195
Yes, I had the same thought.

341
00:33:54,399 --> 00:33:57,960
I think our friend Baker
may have some explaining to do.

342
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:00,971
- I shouldn't have done it.
- What's that?

343
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:04,338
Dragged you into this.
I'm sorry.

344
00:34:04,409 --> 00:34:07,640
Forget it. I was getting tired
of Crete food anyway.

345
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:10,078
No, I'm stupid sometimes.

346
00:34:10,148 --> 00:34:14,175
Even as a kid, I took it for granted
people wanted to play the games I liked.

347
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:17,312
I'd get furious when they didn't.

348
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:20,323
And now they have to.
So why worry?

349
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:47,250
- Hot coffee.
- Oh, that's good.

350
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:59,052
Sorry, Captain. There's a serious
shortage of cups aboard this ship.

351
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:03,466
Remember, I did point out
certain deficiencies in this vessel.

352
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,365
I remember.

353
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:11,474
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

354
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:17,777
Any time you want another chat, sir--
about this boat, I mean--

355
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,282
I'm available.

356
00:35:19,350 --> 00:35:20,783
Right.

357
00:35:26,224 --> 00:35:28,454
And I still can't swim.

358
00:35:33,998 --> 00:35:36,933
Don't mind him.
He doesn't mean anything.

359
00:35:37,001 --> 00:35:40,437
I don't mind him
as much as he seems to mind me.

360
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:47,376
- Have you been together long?
- Since the beginning out here.

361
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:50,812
He's the best friend I have
in this part of the world.

362
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,715
That's a pretty good partner
you've got there yourself.

363
00:35:59,790 --> 00:36:01,155
Yes.

364
00:36:04,862 --> 00:36:07,797
- We've been together a long time too.
- You're lucky.

365
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:16,402
He's going to kill me
when the war is over.

366
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:20,643
You're not serious.

367
00:36:20,711 --> 00:36:22,303
Yes, I am.

368
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:24,840
So is he.

369
00:36:32,823 --> 00:36:36,418
About a year ago
I gave a German patrol a safe conduct...

370
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,894
to get some of their wounded
into hospital.

371
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:42,899
Still had some romantic notions in those
days about fighting a civilized war.

372
00:36:44,802 --> 00:36:48,033
Anyway, they wanted Andrea
pretty badly even then.

373
00:36:48,105 --> 00:36:51,040
They shot their casualties,
went to his house and blew it up.

374
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:57,039
He was out on a job, but his wife
and three children were in the house.

375
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,979
They were all killed.

376
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:04,146
I helped him to bury them.

377
00:37:06,457 --> 00:37:09,893
He didn't say a word to me.
Never looked at me.

378
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,897
But after it was over he turned to me
and said as far as he was concerned...

379
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:18,801
it wasn't the Germans
who were responsible, but me.

380
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,106
Me and my stupid Anglo-Saxon decency.

381
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:28,971
Then he told me
what he was going to do, and when.

382
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,981
Do you think he still means to do it?

383
00:37:34,452 --> 00:37:36,386
He's from Crete.

384
00:37:36,454 --> 00:37:38,388
Those people don't make idle threats.

385
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,728
When I thought I was getting leave...

386
00:37:44,795 --> 00:37:47,821
I was going to ask for transfer
to another area.

387
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:51,732
Some time to think,
get ready for it.

388
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:54,066
And I messed that up.

389
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:56,197
I'm sorry.

390
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,208
That's all right.

391
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,870
It's gonna be a long war.

392
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,880
What makes you sure
he's gonna wait that long?

393
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:08,184
Well, I'm not,
not if he gets the right opportunity.

394
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:17,987
What I'm banking on is that right now
all he wants to do is to kill Germans.

395
00:38:18,062 --> 00:38:22,761
As long as I can be useful to him
in that department...

396
00:38:22,833 --> 00:38:25,996
he'll do his best to keep me alive.

397
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:27,332
I hope.

398
00:38:27,405 --> 00:38:29,339
That's nice of him.

399
00:38:30,708 --> 00:38:32,642
Well, I can see his point.

400
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:38,710
The only way to win a war
is to be just as nasty as the enemy.

401
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:43,482
Only we might wake up one day and find
out we're even nastier than they are.

402
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:46,717
- I can't say that worries me.
- Well, you're lucky.

403
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:02,038
Think I'd better have a look
at the hold...

404
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,275
before Miller tells me to.

405
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:35,175
Help!

406
00:54:20,156 --> 00:54:22,090
Well, we saved the explosives...

407
00:54:22,158 --> 00:54:24,888
the guns, and most of the ammunition.

408
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:31,458
I'm afraid we've lost
the food and the medical supplies.

409
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,332
But if we make our rendezvous
with the Resistance at St. Alexis...

410
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:37,339
they should be able to
supply us with both.

411
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:40,274
Let's get out of this place
as quickly as we can.

412
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,505
Pappadimos and Miller...

413
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,445
you'll have the first shift
with the stretcher.

414
00:54:46,983 --> 00:54:49,543
You're officially taking command
of this team, sir?

415
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:53,622
Yes, I suppose I am. Why?

416
00:54:53,690 --> 00:54:55,624
Just for the record.

417
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:15,877
This afternoon on the boat...

418
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,506
you fumbled your job.

419
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:20,913
How did that happen?

420
00:55:24,087 --> 00:55:26,555
I don't know, sir.

421
00:55:26,623 --> 00:55:30,286
The man was a foot away from you with
his back turned. You only wounded him.

422
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:31,952
How could you miss?

423
00:55:34,097 --> 00:55:36,031
I must have hesitated, sir.

424
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,829
You hesitated?

425
00:55:38,902 --> 00:55:41,666
A man of your experience?

426
00:55:41,738 --> 00:55:45,401
The Butcher of Barcelona?
How could you hesitate?

427
00:55:47,477 --> 00:55:49,411
Then I was tired.

428
00:55:50,580 --> 00:55:52,946
I'm tired and I'm fed up.

429
00:55:53,016 --> 00:55:55,917
I've been fighting this war
a long time.

430
00:55:55,985 --> 00:55:59,978
I've been killing Germans since 1937.
There's no end to them.

431
00:56:00,056 --> 00:56:02,524
You shoot a man at 200 yards,
he's just a moving target.

432
00:56:02,592 --> 00:56:06,619
You kill him with a knife,
you're close enough to smell him.

433
00:56:08,465 --> 00:56:10,399
I smell them in my sleep.

434
00:56:12,035 --> 00:56:14,128
After the last time,
I made a pact with myself.

435
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:16,502
I'd do my job...

436
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:18,507
but I wouldn't do
the other anymore.

437
00:56:19,843 --> 00:56:21,367
Not if I could help it.

438
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:24,572
Who gave you the right
to make a private peace?

439
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,484
You think you're the only one
who's tired?

440
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:33,955
- I do my job, sir.
- Your job is to kill enemy soldiers.

441
00:57:09,959 --> 00:57:12,951
There will, of course,
be a code word.

442
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:16,965
If we don't answer it,
there'll be a patrol up here in no time.

443
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:50,366
Let's pack the gear
and get out of here.

444
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:16,459
Let's go.

445
00:58:16,459 --> 00:58:18,222
Let's go.

446
00:58:20,363 --> 00:58:21,489
Well?

447
00:58:25,268 --> 00:58:27,634
The major's leg is broken
in two places.

448
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:30,935
For all we know, he's hurt inside too.
He needs proper medical attention.

449
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,372
What do you suggest?

450
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,501
If we leave him here,
the Germans will take care of him.

451
00:58:34,577 --> 00:58:36,602
They'd get him to a hospital.

452
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:40,376
If he doesn't get sulfanilamide
for his leg, he doesn't stand a chance.

453
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,749
Naturally, you all think a lot
of Major Franklin. So do I.

454
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:46,288
We have two choices.

455
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:49,018
Take him with us, and if
he doesn't get help soon, he'll die.

456
00:58:49,092 --> 00:58:53,756
Or we can leave him here, in which case
he'll tell the Germans everything.

457
00:58:53,830 --> 00:58:55,855
Roy? Never!

458
00:58:55,932 --> 00:59:00,801
He might not be able to help himself.
They have other drugs besides sulfa.

459
00:59:00,870 --> 00:59:03,532
All they have to do is to shoot him
full of Scopolamine...

460
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:06,131
and he'll tell them
our whole plan in detail.

461
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,700
There is, of course,
a third choice.

462
00:59:09,846 --> 00:59:11,746
One bullet now.

463
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:13,281
Better for him,
better for us.

464
00:59:13,349 --> 00:59:16,284
You take that man along,
you endanger us all.

465
00:59:16,352 --> 00:59:18,752
Why don't we just drop him
off the cliff and save a bullet?

466
00:59:18,821 --> 00:59:20,755
And why don't you shut up?

467
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,557
Yes, there's a third choice.

468
00:59:25,628 --> 00:59:27,391
We'll make it if necessary...

469
00:59:27,463 --> 00:59:29,761
when it's necessary...

470
00:59:29,832 --> 00:59:31,231
and not before!

471
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,326
Now, let's get moving.

472
00:59:36,673 --> 00:59:39,608
From now on, your job is
to look after Major Franklin.

473
00:59:42,312 --> 00:59:43,643
I said move!

474
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:54,006
Morning.

475
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:59,086
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

476
01:00:59,155 --> 01:01:01,919
It's just bad luck.

477
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:04,721
What do we do now?

478
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,058
- Where are we?
- We're on our way.

479
01:01:08,965 --> 01:01:12,230
- I'm going to hold you up.
- No, you won't.

480
01:01:12,301 --> 01:01:15,668
Anyway, the professor here won the toss,
and he's just dying to carry you.

481
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:17,501
- Aren't you, Professor?
- That's right.

482
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:20,064
You're nowhere near as heavy
as I thought you were.

483
01:01:20,143 --> 01:01:22,805
Now, look...

484
01:01:22,879 --> 01:01:25,040
you've got to leave me.

485
01:01:25,114 --> 01:01:27,412
You're out of your mind.

486
01:01:27,483 --> 01:01:29,747
It's radio time.

487
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:32,310
Well, it's all on your plate now.

488
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:37,785
You'll never be able
to thank me enough, will you?

489
01:01:38,895 --> 01:01:41,830
I wanted the job all the time.

490
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:09,183
<i>Hello, Lucky.</i>

491
01:02:09,258 --> 01:02:11,089
<i>Report by signal.</i>

492
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,219
Hello, George Mike William.

493
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:16,265
Strength four. Over.

494
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:19,529
<i>Hello, Lucky.</i>
<i>This is most urgent.</i>

495
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:23,129
<i>Paddington Station will close</i>
<i>at midnight x-minus-one.</i>

496
01:02:23,206 --> 01:02:26,039
<i>Do you understand?</i>
<i>X-minus-one.</i>

497
01:02:26,109 --> 01:02:27,838
<i>Over.</i>

498
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,844
We've lost a full day.

499
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:35,444
Germans are going to hit Kheros
a day ahead of time.

500
01:02:37,520 --> 01:02:40,455
Gives us until midnight
the day after tomorrow.

501
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:45,919
Message understood.
Over and out.

502
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:34,304
I'd like to be alone
with the major.

503
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:08,143
Roy, that was foolish.

504
01:04:10,046 --> 01:04:12,981
You almost ruined everything.
We just heard from headquarters.

505
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,346
We're cancelled out.

506
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:18,686
- Scrubbed.
- What?

507
01:04:18,754 --> 01:04:22,121
They're going for
an amphibious landing...

508
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:25,251
the day after tomorrow
on the east coast.

509
01:04:28,164 --> 01:04:29,529
The Turkish side.

510
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,697
And they're coming in force.

511
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:38,934
As far as we're concerned,
the pressure's off.

512
01:04:39,008 --> 01:04:41,943
All we have to do is
make as much trouble as we can.

513
01:04:42,011 --> 01:04:46,414
By tonight, we'll have you
in the hands of the underground.

514
01:04:46,482 --> 01:04:48,416
We'll have you taken care of.

515
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:57,823
You try this again,
I'll have Andrea break your other leg.

516
01:05:23,252 --> 01:05:24,583
Good luck.

517
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:27,020
Do not worry.

518
01:05:27,089 --> 01:05:30,024
I shall see you tonight
at St. Alexis.

519
01:07:30,679 --> 01:07:32,203
Good evening, gentlemen.

520
01:07:35,184 --> 01:07:38,745
Obviously, this place
has been used before.

521
01:07:41,424 --> 01:07:43,085
Any food around?

522
01:07:44,360 --> 01:07:46,385
I regret to say no.

523
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:50,865
Weren't you a little careless just now?
We might have been anyone.

524
01:07:50,933 --> 01:07:53,993
Oh, no, no. I heard you coming
five minutes ago.

525
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:12,677
It's time to relieve Andrea.

526
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,016
- I'll take it.
- No.

527
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,752
Pappadimos, you go.

528
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:30,458
- Maybe he brought us some food.
- Hold it.

529
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:32,467
He might be faking.

530
01:09:39,375 --> 01:09:40,603
Saved.

531
01:09:48,184 --> 01:09:49,583
Don't move!

532
01:09:51,954 --> 01:09:54,616
Raise your hands.

533
01:09:54,690 --> 01:09:56,351
Raise your hands high.

534
01:09:56,425 --> 01:09:59,758
All of you.

535
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,194
You there, with the food, speak!

536
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:10,738
You are not Germans.

537
01:10:12,208 --> 01:10:14,267
Which of you is Major Franklin?

538
01:10:16,779 --> 01:10:18,679
The man on the stretcher.
Who are you?

539
01:10:18,747 --> 01:10:20,146
My name is Maria Pappadimos.

540
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:25,244
You may put your hands down now.

541
01:10:36,065 --> 01:10:40,001
- They told us Pappadimos was a man.
- My father. He was taken two days ago.

542
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,469
He was taken?

543
01:10:42,538 --> 01:10:46,167
He told them nothing.
He will die first.

544
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:50,110
- You have any sisters or brothers?
- I have a brother, Spiro, in America.

545
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:55,950
He's not that far away.

546
01:10:58,787 --> 01:11:01,415
He's that handsome devil
right over there.

547
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:16,200
What did you do that for?

548
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,571
To remind you
to write letters occasionally.

549
01:11:19,642 --> 01:11:22,702
- There happens to be a war on.
- I mean before the war!

550
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:25,872
I promised myself I would do this
the first time I saw you again.

551
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,949
Well, I'm sorry, brother.

552
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:49,069
Which of you did this?

553
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,907
I'm afraid it was me.

554
01:11:53,976 --> 01:11:57,207
- Who is she?
- She's my friend Anna. She's one of us.

555
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:01,074
It's bad that this happened to her.

556
01:12:02,451 --> 01:12:05,352
Before the Germans came,
she was a schoolteacher in Mandrakos.

557
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:07,651
Last year she was caught.

558
01:12:07,723 --> 01:12:10,021
They tortured her
to make her betray us.

559
01:12:10,092 --> 01:12:12,424
They whipped her
until the white of her bones showed.

560
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:16,591
Some nights,
we could hear her screaming.

561
01:12:18,167 --> 01:12:21,967
Then they took her to the fortress,
and they kept her there for six months.

562
01:12:22,037 --> 01:12:24,164
When they let her go...

563
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:27,400
she could not speak.

564
01:12:27,476 --> 01:12:32,243
She has never spoken since,
not even in her dreams.

565
01:12:32,314 --> 01:12:35,943
Even I have never been allowed
to see the scars on her back.

566
01:12:36,018 --> 01:12:39,510
But she's a good fighter--
as good as any of you.

567
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,579
She's like a ghost.
She goes anywhere.

568
01:12:41,657 --> 01:12:45,388
She got us these guns,
and she kills without mercy.

569
01:12:45,461 --> 01:12:47,725
You are very lucky, brother.

570
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:59,339
No, they're friends!
Our friends!

571
01:15:07,736 --> 01:15:09,670
It's gangrene, sir.

572
01:15:11,106 --> 01:15:13,574
If the major's leg doesn't come off,
he's gonna die.

573
01:15:13,642 --> 01:15:16,167
Does he know?

574
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:17,735
I don't think so.

575
01:15:22,451 --> 01:15:24,681
Sir?

576
01:15:24,753 --> 01:15:29,349
Beg pardon, sir, but this is the first
chance I've had to talk to you alone.

577
01:15:29,424 --> 01:15:33,588
I don't want to be left out anymore.
I want to be part of the team again.

578
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:37,527
Please give me a chance.
You can trust me.

579
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:40,134
I'll think it over.

580
01:15:45,173 --> 01:15:48,040
That's gangrene.
What choice do we have now, Captain?

581
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,476
- Who relieved you?
- She did.

582
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,071
- In future, take orders only from me.
- Yes, sir.

583
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:56,709
- I asked you a question, sir.
- And I heard you, Corporal.

584
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:00,879
Get yourself something to eat.

585
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:03,151
That's an order.

586
01:16:03,225 --> 01:16:05,159
Thank you, sir.

587
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:13,132
There's a lot of activity
down there.

588
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:14,964
I can hear it.

589
01:16:15,037 --> 01:16:17,005
They're turning Mandrakos
inside out.

590
01:16:18,774 --> 01:16:21,368
As soon as they move out,
we're going to move in.

591
01:16:21,443 --> 01:16:23,536
We're going to get you
to a doctor.

592
01:16:23,612 --> 01:16:26,308
Brown says that
you are doing well.

593
01:16:27,683 --> 01:16:31,312
Brown's a liar, and so are you.

594
01:16:31,386 --> 01:16:33,820
I haven't lost
my sense of smell, you know.

595
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:37,519
I just hope the doctor's a good surgeon.

596
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,852
I wonder what old Jensen would say.

597
01:16:43,465 --> 01:16:46,730
My luck seems to have changed,
hasn't it?

598
01:16:46,802 --> 01:16:49,737
I don't suppose
I'll ever be a general now.

599
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:02,516
This Franklin--

600
01:17:02,584 --> 01:17:05,018
He's not a bad fellow.

601
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:06,816
No, not bad at all.

602
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:44,721
- There's a tunnel out of that ravine?
- Yes, sir. They'll never find us there.

603
01:17:44,793 --> 01:17:47,853
They found us here.
Let's go. Let's go!

604
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:25,652
Oh, excuse me.

605
01:19:27,629 --> 01:19:29,563
- Where is this tunnel?
- Up here, sir.

606
01:20:11,173 --> 01:20:13,368
Where does this lead to?

607
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:16,239
We'll come out just behind Mandrakos.

608
01:20:17,546 --> 01:20:20,674
All right. Let's keep going.

609
01:20:43,572 --> 01:20:46,564
You're limping. Are you hurt?
Do you need help?

610
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:32,540
Thank you, old bean.

611
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:41,955
Get off your behinds.

612
01:22:51,032 --> 01:22:52,966
Think there's a fire escape here?

613
01:25:41,469 --> 01:25:43,801
These are fine people.

614
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:55,868
Give up quietly, gentlemen...

615
01:26:55,944 --> 01:26:58,936
unless you want a great many innocent
people killed as well as yourselves.

616
01:27:23,771 --> 01:27:25,705
Turn around, please.

617
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:32,540
Captain Mallory, my congratulations.
You have made a remarkable effort.

618
01:27:32,614 --> 01:27:35,515
Unfortunately for you,
it was doomed from the beginning.

619
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:38,245
Will you tell me where
you've hidden your explosives?

620
01:27:41,322 --> 01:27:44,849
As your commanding officer,
Captain Mallory must play a heroic role.

621
01:27:44,926 --> 01:27:47,394
You needn't carry such a burden.

622
01:27:47,462 --> 01:27:51,125
You've all suffered a great deal.
Why prolong that suffering?

623
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:53,133
For you, the war is over.

624
01:27:54,535 --> 01:27:59,336
Another officer is coming
to question you, a captain in the S.S.

625
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:03,104
His methods, quite frankly,
are most severe.

626
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:06,806
Gentlemen, none of you are in uniform.
Therefore, you must be considered spies.

627
01:28:06,881 --> 01:28:08,815
You all know the penalty for espionage.

628
01:28:08,883 --> 01:28:11,750
But if any of you has
the courage and the intelligence...

629
01:28:11,819 --> 01:28:14,344
to tell me where the explosives are...

630
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:17,448
I promise you will not only
save your own life...

631
01:28:17,525 --> 01:28:19,857
but the lives
of all your comrades as well.

632
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:25,759
This will be your only chance,
gentlemen. I advise you to take it.

633
01:28:27,035 --> 01:28:29,196
Please, sir--
Please, I am no spy.

634
01:28:29,270 --> 01:28:30,601
I am not one of them!

635
01:28:30,672 --> 01:28:32,697
- Sir--
- You yellow--

636
01:28:37,478 --> 01:28:38,843
Go on.

637
01:28:38,913 --> 01:28:40,938
Sir--

638
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:42,846
I swear to you, sir...

639
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:46,114
I'm just a poor fisherman.

640
01:28:46,187 --> 01:28:50,089
Two days ago, these men
killed my sailors and stole my boat.

641
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,456
They forced me to join them.

642
01:28:52,527 --> 01:28:54,825
Sir, sir, I am their prisoner!

643
01:28:54,896 --> 01:28:56,887
Where did you learn your English,
fisherman?

644
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:00,231
In Cyprus, sir.

645
01:29:00,301 --> 01:29:02,565
I swear to you it's true.

646
01:29:02,637 --> 01:29:04,696
Aren't you Andrea Stavrou?

647
01:29:04,772 --> 01:29:06,569
Colonel Stavrou?

648
01:29:08,676 --> 01:29:10,610
No, sir.
My name is Nando Salonicus.

649
01:29:10,678 --> 01:29:13,738
I told you,
I'm a fisherman from Cyprus.

650
01:29:17,151 --> 01:29:20,086
Then how do you happen
to wear a shoulder holster?

651
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:25,181
They forced me to wear it...

652
01:29:25,259 --> 01:29:27,853
and make it a kind of joke.

653
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:29,794
And where are the explosives?

654
01:29:29,864 --> 01:29:32,628
I swear, sir...

655
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:34,463
I would tell you if I knew.

656
01:29:34,535 --> 01:29:36,400
But...

657
01:29:36,471 --> 01:29:38,701
see, they didn't say.

658
01:29:38,773 --> 01:29:40,104
The truth is, sir...

659
01:29:40,174 --> 01:29:42,734
- they don't trust me.
- I don't blame them.

660
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:58,917
The commandant will telephone you
shortly to congratulate you, Meusel.

661
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:00,893
Thank you.

662
01:30:00,962 --> 01:30:04,261
I questioned them about the explosives,
but they refused to answer.

663
01:30:05,533 --> 01:30:07,694
The Greek claims
that he's not one of them.

664
01:30:08,803 --> 01:30:12,261
Now, you! You are not
of this company, you say?

665
01:30:12,340 --> 01:30:15,309
- Oh, no, sir, I'm not.
- You are a liar!

666
01:30:19,080 --> 01:30:20,445
- But--
- A liar!

667
01:30:24,585 --> 01:30:27,281
Come, come, that didn't hurt.

668
01:30:27,355 --> 01:30:30,347
- Where are the explosives?
- I don't know, Your Excellency.

669
01:30:31,859 --> 01:30:33,656
I swear to you.

670
01:30:33,728 --> 01:30:35,821
I am not one of these men!

671
01:30:35,897 --> 01:30:39,094
They forced me to join them,
as I explained to the captain.

672
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:45,163
I'm just a poor fisherman
from Cyprus.

673
01:30:45,239 --> 01:30:47,537
My name is...

674
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:50,099
Nando Salonicus.

675
01:30:50,178 --> 01:30:52,112
I swear to you.

676
01:30:54,248 --> 01:30:56,716
These men, they stole my boat.

677
01:30:56,784 --> 01:30:59,947
They forced me to join them,
Your Excellency.

678
01:31:00,021 --> 01:31:01,613
I am their prisoner!

679
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:32,849
Where are the explosives?
I want an answer now.

680
01:31:32,920 --> 01:31:36,515
Otherwise, I shall personally
rearrange this officer's splints.

681
01:31:44,232 --> 01:31:45,756
Very well.

682
01:31:50,905 --> 01:31:53,135
I can't!
Please, I can't!

683
01:32:00,147 --> 01:32:01,876
Get up!

684
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:06,382
Please. Oh, I'm sick.

685
01:32:11,926 --> 01:32:14,053
Oh, please. I'm sick.

686
01:32:24,138 --> 01:32:26,072
Call the sentry in.

687
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:39,751
Now, Oberleutenant...

688
01:32:39,820 --> 01:32:42,186
get on the phone.

689
01:32:42,256 --> 01:32:45,919
Tell them that you're not to be
disturbed until you give further orders.

690
01:32:51,232 --> 01:32:53,598
Remember...

691
01:32:53,668 --> 01:32:55,431
I speak German.

692
01:32:56,304 --> 01:32:57,737
Perfect.

693
01:33:07,782 --> 01:33:09,750
Not very hygienic, I must say.

694
01:33:09,817 --> 01:33:12,843
Shocking taste in undies too.
Oh, well.

695
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:14,410
<i>Heil,</i> everybody.

696
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:37,266
Well, Roy,
we're gonna leave you here.

697
01:33:37,345 --> 01:33:39,279
I understand.

698
01:33:43,451 --> 01:33:46,943
We're gonna let them
chase us around for awhile.

699
01:33:47,021 --> 01:33:50,115
But the one thing
that they mustn't know...

700
01:33:50,191 --> 01:33:53,354
is about the landing
tomorrow night.

701
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:55,361
Of course.

702
01:33:57,098 --> 01:33:59,032
Don't worry.

703
01:34:01,302 --> 01:34:03,236
Thanks.

704
01:34:05,339 --> 01:34:07,273
Good luck.

705
01:34:10,911 --> 01:34:12,173
Hold it!

706
01:34:14,548 --> 01:34:16,607
We're going to leave
Major Franklin behind.

707
01:34:19,320 --> 01:34:24,121
He's a wounded officer. I expect him
to get proper medical attention.

708
01:34:25,192 --> 01:34:26,989
We don't make war on wounded men.

709
01:34:29,096 --> 01:34:31,530
We're not all
like Hauptmann Sessler.

710
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:36,594
Where's the camp radio station?

711
01:34:37,905 --> 01:34:39,839
I will not tell you.

712
01:34:43,577 --> 01:34:47,673
You wouldn't hesitate to kill me
for any number of reasons...

713
01:34:47,748 --> 01:34:50,182
but not this one.

714
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,185
In any event,
I will not tell you.

715
01:35:08,335 --> 01:35:11,270
- So long, Roy.
- Good luck, Keith.

716
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:17,411
Well, Lucky, I shall miss you.

717
01:35:20,881 --> 01:35:23,441
You will try to be
a bad patient, won't you?

718
01:35:23,517 --> 01:35:26,509
Keep on asking them for bed pans.
Drives them mad.

719
01:35:26,587 --> 01:35:28,817
I'll keep it in mind.

720
01:35:32,727 --> 01:35:35,252
When this is over,
you can buy me lunch.

721
01:35:35,329 --> 01:35:38,662
Roast beef, Yorkshire pudding,
a nice little red wine.

722
01:35:38,733 --> 01:35:40,860
Steak and kidney pie.

723
01:35:40,935 --> 01:35:42,869
Anything you say.
You'll be paying for it.

724
01:35:49,643 --> 01:35:52,168
And you, Colonel,
what a performance.

725
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:54,709
All right.

726
01:36:52,173 --> 01:36:56,234
Well, my friend, I hope you were right
to leave Franklin with the Germans.

727
01:37:35,416 --> 01:37:37,782
- Sir?
- Yes.

728
01:37:37,852 --> 01:37:40,446
No, not you, sir.
Mr. Stavrou.

729
01:37:40,521 --> 01:37:43,319
- Hmm?
- Tell me about yourself.

730
01:37:44,692 --> 01:37:47,160
- What do you want to know?
- Are you married?

731
01:37:47,228 --> 01:37:51,164
I have been married.

732
01:37:51,232 --> 01:37:53,257
My wife and children were killed.

733
01:37:59,273 --> 01:38:00,740
Have you killed many people?

734
01:38:02,843 --> 01:38:06,176
Only Germans.
Oh, some Italians too.

735
01:38:06,247 --> 01:38:08,078
Captain Mallory?

736
01:38:08,148 --> 01:38:09,206
Yes.

737
01:38:09,283 --> 01:38:12,878
- You are a lucky man.
- Yes, I know.

738
01:38:14,622 --> 01:38:17,022
- Mr. Stavrou?
- Yes?

739
01:38:17,091 --> 01:38:19,082
I like you.

740
01:38:22,830 --> 01:38:24,092
I like you too.

741
01:39:22,957 --> 01:39:24,549
I don't know.

742
01:39:24,625 --> 01:39:28,061
Well, baby face,
who would've known you?

743
01:39:28,128 --> 01:39:30,619
You've got to get rid of that fuzz
under your nose, haven't you?

744
01:39:30,698 --> 01:39:33,030
Oh, no, not me. I'm an officer now.
Remember?

745
01:39:33,100 --> 01:39:35,227
Sorry, old bean.
You just picked the wrong uniform.

746
01:39:39,640 --> 01:39:43,667
Lights out in five minutes. I want you
all to get as much rest as possible.

747
01:39:43,744 --> 01:39:46,611
The first thing in the morning...

748
01:39:46,680 --> 01:39:50,081
we've got to ditch the truck
and get hold of another car.

749
01:39:50,150 --> 01:39:54,143
Then we're going to pick up
the explosives and go into Navarone.

750
01:39:54,221 --> 01:39:57,679
We've got to be inside the fortress
by 10:00 tomorrow night.

751
01:39:57,758 --> 01:39:59,658
Might one inquire how, sir?

752
01:39:59,727 --> 01:40:01,854
We're gonna walk in.

753
01:40:01,929 --> 01:40:03,988
Simply because of this masquerade?

754
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:12,036
Because I told Franklin
that our orders had been changed.

755
01:40:14,575 --> 01:40:16,509
That we weren't
after their guns anymore.

756
01:40:16,577 --> 01:40:18,511
I told him that we were
just to create a diversion...

757
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:22,015
for a full-scale assault
tomorrow night on the Turkish side.

758
01:40:22,082 --> 01:40:24,016
If my hunch is right...

759
01:40:24,084 --> 01:40:26,951
the Germans will give him
Scopalamine...

760
01:40:27,021 --> 01:40:30,457
before they operate,
and that's what he's going to tell them.

761
01:40:30,524 --> 01:40:31,991
They may not believe it...

762
01:40:32,059 --> 01:40:34,892
but they'll be faced with the fact
that he does.

763
01:40:36,597 --> 01:40:38,064
Now, I'm gambling...

764
01:40:38,132 --> 01:40:40,532
that they'll clear out of Navarone...

765
01:40:40,601 --> 01:40:42,535
and take up positions on the coast.

766
01:40:42,603 --> 01:40:44,571
Very clever.

767
01:40:47,775 --> 01:40:51,176
But that still leaves the garrison
inside the fortress.

768
01:40:51,245 --> 01:40:53,406
And we get them out...

769
01:40:53,480 --> 01:40:56,347
by having Andrea,
Pappadimos and Brown...

770
01:40:56,417 --> 01:40:58,476
start up diversions...

771
01:40:58,552 --> 01:41:00,713
all over Navarone.

772
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:03,882
If there's enough confusion going...

773
01:41:03,957 --> 01:41:06,858
Miller and I should have a fair chance
of breaking in.

774
01:41:06,927 --> 01:41:08,861
At the same time...

775
01:41:08,929 --> 01:41:11,591
the two girls will steal
the fastest boat that they can find...

776
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:16,193
so that we'll all have a chance of
getting out of here when this is over.

777
01:41:16,270 --> 01:41:19,262
Very clever, indeed.

778
01:41:19,339 --> 01:41:22,274
Suppose, just for the sake of argument,
they don't have any Scopalamine.

779
01:41:22,342 --> 01:41:25,334
What happens then?

780
01:41:25,412 --> 01:41:28,711
Suppose they use
the old-fashioned methods.

781
01:41:28,782 --> 01:41:32,013
Suppose your ventriloquist's dummy
just won't talk...

782
01:41:32,086 --> 01:41:35,351
because he's a very good man;
he won't be easy to break.

783
01:41:35,422 --> 01:41:37,356
He may take a lot of punishment...

784
01:41:37,424 --> 01:41:39,358
before he tells them
what you want him to tell them.

785
01:41:39,426 --> 01:41:43,021
He may even die on them
and tell them nothing at all.

786
01:41:43,097 --> 01:41:44,758
Have you considered that, Captain?

787
01:41:47,468 --> 01:41:48,730
Yes, I've considered it.

788
01:41:48,802 --> 01:41:50,736
I'll bet you have.

789
01:41:53,607 --> 01:41:56,508
I'll bet you've considered that
as far back as the cliff.

790
01:41:56,577 --> 01:42:00,035
You and your three choices.

791
01:42:01,682 --> 01:42:03,616
I'll bet that's why you ordered us
to drag...

792
01:42:03,684 --> 01:42:06,619
that poor, dying, one-legged man
around with us all this time.

793
01:42:06,687 --> 01:42:09,485
Even if he lives,
he'll never be the same again.

794
01:42:09,556 --> 01:42:13,390
Do you know what you've done?

795
01:42:13,460 --> 01:42:16,588
You've used up
an important human being.

796
01:42:19,900 --> 01:42:24,394
Oh, I misjudged you.
You're rather a ruthless character...

797
01:42:24,471 --> 01:42:26,405
Captain Mallory.

798
01:42:28,475 --> 01:42:31,069
I didn't think of it
back on the cliff...

799
01:42:31,145 --> 01:42:35,582
but if I had, I'd have done
exactly the same thing.

800
01:42:35,649 --> 01:42:37,742
It's the only chance we've got
to get the job done.

801
01:42:37,818 --> 01:42:40,582
Well, right now, I say
the hell with the job!

802
01:42:40,654 --> 01:42:44,021
I've been on a hundred jobs. Not one
of them's altered the course of the war.

803
01:42:44,091 --> 01:42:46,025
There've been a thousand wars,
and there'll be a thousand more...

804
01:42:46,093 --> 01:42:48,584
until we all kill each other
off completely.

805
01:42:48,662 --> 01:42:51,358
I don't care about the war anymore.
I care about Roy.

806
01:42:51,431 --> 01:42:53,490
And if Turkey comes into the war
on the wrong side?

807
01:42:53,567 --> 01:42:56,764
So what? Let the whole bloody world
come in and blow itself to pieces.

808
01:42:56,837 --> 01:42:57,929
That's what it deserves.

809
01:42:58,005 --> 01:43:00,496
And what about the 2,000 men
on Kheros?

810
01:43:00,574 --> 01:43:03,839
I don't know the men on Kheros,
but I do know the man on Navarone!

811
01:43:03,911 --> 01:43:06,243
Mr. Miller...

812
01:43:06,313 --> 01:43:08,338
the man was finished
when he fell.

813
01:43:08,415 --> 01:43:11,873
That's easy for you to say,
sitting there, drinking coffee.

814
01:43:25,199 --> 01:43:29,966
You know, it's funny. I was grateful
to you when you left him behind today.

815
01:43:30,037 --> 01:43:32,369
I just hope, before this job's over...

816
01:43:32,439 --> 01:43:36,068
that I get the chance to use you
the way you've used him.

817
01:43:39,780 --> 01:43:42,806
I'm sorry, but I couldn't think
of any other way.

818
01:43:46,486 --> 01:43:49,717
Everybody, get a good night's sleep.

819
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:53,817
No matter how it goes tomorrow,
you're gonna need it.

820
01:43:56,396 --> 01:43:58,330
I'll take the first watch.

821
01:45:08,302 --> 01:45:09,894
Hello.

822
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:31,653
Tell me, schoolteacher...

823
01:45:31,725 --> 01:45:34,660
from a purely moral point of view...

824
01:45:36,330 --> 01:45:41,267
bearing in mind that we represent
the side of goodness and civilization...

825
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:45,169
do you think that what I did to Franklin
was a civilized thing to do?

826
01:48:49,923 --> 01:48:51,356
They are burning Mandrakos...

827
01:48:51,424 --> 01:48:53,358
in punishment.

828
01:51:10,764 --> 01:51:13,324
This part of the town
has been evacuated...

829
01:51:13,400 --> 01:51:16,631
because the vibration of the guns
has weakened the houses.

830
01:52:11,057 --> 01:52:14,424
Where will the attacks come?

831
01:52:14,494 --> 01:52:17,122
On the Turkish side.

832
01:52:17,197 --> 01:52:19,392
What time?

833
01:52:49,129 --> 01:52:50,391
Is the timetable clear?

834
01:52:50,463 --> 01:52:52,931
Any questions?

835
01:52:54,300 --> 01:52:55,392
Good luck.

836
01:53:10,150 --> 01:53:12,710
I won't be needing this.
You take it.

837
01:53:25,565 --> 01:53:29,626
Everybody stay exactly where you are.
The party's over.

838
01:53:31,137 --> 01:53:33,401
Somebody's stepped on the cake.

839
01:53:34,541 --> 01:53:37,635
Exhibit "A":
a clockwork fuse.

840
01:53:37,710 --> 01:53:40,474
Elementary and archaic,
but they work.

841
01:53:40,547 --> 01:53:42,981
Only this one won't work anymore.
Do you know why?

842
01:53:43,049 --> 01:53:46,109
The clock's okay,
but the contact arm's been broken off.

843
01:53:46,186 --> 01:53:50,623
This clock could tick until Christmas,
and it wouldn't set off a firecracker.

844
01:53:52,358 --> 01:53:53,450
Exhibit "B"--

845
01:53:53,526 --> 01:53:55,960
Exhibit "B" is missing.

846
01:53:56,029 --> 01:54:00,432
All my slow-burning fuses are gone,
disappeared, vanished.

847
01:54:00,500 --> 01:54:04,334
Exhibit "C":
my time pencils.

848
01:54:04,404 --> 01:54:07,396
Seventy-five grains of fulminate
of mercury in each one of them.

849
01:54:07,473 --> 01:54:09,407
Enough to blow my hand off...

850
01:54:09,475 --> 01:54:13,036
and very unstable, very delicate.

851
01:54:22,322 --> 01:54:24,882
Which means that there is a traitor
in this room.

852
01:54:24,958 --> 01:54:27,552
You're crazy.
It must've happened back at base.

853
01:54:27,627 --> 01:54:30,687
No, I'm not that crazy.
I checked it all before I left the base.

854
01:54:32,165 --> 01:54:34,963
No. Here. Here!

855
01:54:35,034 --> 01:54:37,559
Someone here.

856
01:54:40,807 --> 01:54:42,331
But who?

857
01:54:42,408 --> 01:54:43,636
Who?

858
01:54:43,710 --> 01:54:47,373
There've only been two times
when this stuff's been out of my sight.

859
01:54:47,447 --> 01:54:51,383
Once was when Andrea and Maria
took it away to hide it.

860
01:54:54,053 --> 01:54:56,647
But it was all right
when we picked it up again.

861
01:54:56,723 --> 01:54:58,987
The only other time was when we left it
in the back of the truck...

862
01:54:59,058 --> 01:55:01,492
and all of us went to scout the gates.

863
01:55:01,561 --> 01:55:03,495
All of us...

864
01:55:06,165 --> 01:55:07,257
except her.

865
01:55:09,102 --> 01:55:12,094
We left her on guard
in the truck alone.

866
01:55:13,273 --> 01:55:14,604
You are crazy.

867
01:55:14,674 --> 01:55:18,508
Let me just think for a moment.

868
01:55:23,283 --> 01:55:27,117
Since we came here, we've been jumping
out of one frying pan into another.

869
01:55:27,186 --> 01:55:29,177
Just think.

870
01:55:29,255 --> 01:55:31,746
We're hiding in the Carob Grove...

871
01:55:31,824 --> 01:55:34,759
and she's up in a tree, remember?

872
01:55:34,827 --> 01:55:38,923
Now, anybody can signal to an airplane
with a piece of tin or a hand mirror.

873
01:55:38,998 --> 01:55:41,626
They found us there, didn't they?

874
01:55:41,701 --> 01:55:43,635
And then in the tunnel...

875
01:55:43,703 --> 01:55:47,002
she's lagging far behind
with a shocking limp.

876
01:55:47,073 --> 01:55:48,700
Anybody seen her limping lately?

877
01:55:48,775 --> 01:55:52,074
But being way back behind us, she could
leave some messages, couldn't she?

878
01:55:52,145 --> 01:55:54,511
So that when you take Roy
to the doctor...

879
01:55:54,580 --> 01:55:56,810
the Germans are waiting there
for you.

880
01:55:56,883 --> 01:55:59,443
And then when she takes us to her place,
they come right there for us.

881
01:55:59,519 --> 01:56:00,952
But she got us out of there.

882
01:56:01,020 --> 01:56:03,079
Of course.
That house would've been a shambles...

883
01:56:03,156 --> 01:56:05,056
and she'd have got hers
along with the rest of us.

884
01:56:05,124 --> 01:56:07,649
So what does she do?

885
01:56:07,727 --> 01:56:11,720
She disappears into the bedroom
to change her clothes...

886
01:56:11,798 --> 01:56:14,062
and to leave a little note.

887
01:56:14,133 --> 01:56:16,124
And then she takes us
to the wedding party...

888
01:56:16,202 --> 01:56:19,365
and we're caught like rats in a trap
because we can't get to our guns.

889
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:22,567
Even if we can, it means slaughtering
half the population of Mandrakos.

890
01:56:22,642 --> 01:56:25,702
You are an insane man!

891
01:56:25,778 --> 01:56:28,941
Am I? Maybe I am.

892
01:56:30,049 --> 01:56:31,983
Nothing would surprise me anymore.

893
01:56:39,726 --> 01:56:42,320
But we can settle this thing
very easily.

894
01:56:42,395 --> 01:56:45,421
Let's see those scars
the Germans made on her back.

895
01:56:45,498 --> 01:56:47,489
Those terrible scars.

896
01:56:49,736 --> 01:56:51,829
How about it, Maria?

897
01:56:51,904 --> 01:56:54,372
Don't you want to see those scars
you've never seen?

898
01:57:23,036 --> 01:57:24,970
Q.E.D.

899
01:57:42,889 --> 01:57:44,823
You cannot believe it.

900
01:57:46,659 --> 01:57:48,593
Believe it.

901
01:57:49,762 --> 01:57:51,696
I cannot stand pain.

902
01:57:54,067 --> 01:57:57,935
It's easy to be brave when you're free,
when you're with your friends.

903
01:57:58,004 --> 01:58:00,495
But I was caught.

904
01:58:00,573 --> 01:58:02,564
The others were free,
but they didn't help me.

905
01:58:02,642 --> 01:58:04,576
I was alone.

906
01:58:05,878 --> 01:58:08,005
I was alone in their hands.

907
01:58:09,582 --> 01:58:13,018
They said they would put me
into their brothels.

908
01:58:13,086 --> 01:58:15,520
They said they would torture me.

909
01:58:18,658 --> 01:58:21,422
I saw what they did to other people.

910
01:58:28,935 --> 01:58:31,802
I'm sorry. I cannot stand pain.

911
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:39,203
When we got here...

912
01:58:41,547 --> 01:58:43,481
why didn't you put in with us?

913
01:58:47,186 --> 01:58:49,120
You could have come with us!

914
01:58:50,990 --> 01:58:52,924
It was your only chance
to get free of them!

915
01:58:53,993 --> 01:58:56,553
There was never any chance.

916
01:58:56,629 --> 01:58:58,563
You never had any chance.

917
01:58:58,631 --> 01:59:01,794
It was hopeless from the beginning.

918
01:59:01,868 --> 01:59:04,268
You'll never get out of here!
Never!

919
01:59:06,372 --> 01:59:08,465
I tried to tell you last night.

920
01:59:24,790 --> 01:59:27,054
Can you do anything at all?

921
01:59:27,126 --> 01:59:29,060
I don't know.

922
01:59:31,564 --> 01:59:34,499
There's always some way
to blow up explosives.

923
01:59:34,567 --> 01:59:37,502
The trick is not to be around
when they go off.

924
01:59:38,704 --> 01:59:41,605
But aren't you forgetting something,
Captain?

925
01:59:41,674 --> 01:59:43,835
The lady.

926
01:59:43,910 --> 01:59:46,504
As I see it,
we have three choices.

927
01:59:46,579 --> 01:59:49,776
One: We can leave her here, but there's
no guarantee she won't be found.

928
01:59:49,849 --> 01:59:52,113
And, in her case,
they won't need a truth drug.

929
01:59:52,185 --> 01:59:54,153
Two: We could take her with us.

930
01:59:54,220 --> 01:59:56,688
But that would just make things a lot
more difficult than they are already.

931
01:59:56,756 --> 01:59:59,350
And three--

932
01:59:59,425 --> 02:00:02,326
Well, that's Andrea's choice.
Remember?

933
02:00:06,132 --> 02:00:08,066
You really want
your pound of flesh, don't you?

934
02:00:08,134 --> 02:00:10,694
Yes. Yes, I do.

935
02:00:12,038 --> 02:00:15,337
You see, somehow I just couldn't manage
to get off to sleep last night.

936
02:00:15,408 --> 02:00:17,467
If you're so anxious to kill her,
go ahead!

937
02:00:17,543 --> 02:00:22,139
Oh, I'm not anxious to kill her.
I'm not anxious to kill anyone.

938
02:00:22,215 --> 02:00:24,206
See, I'm not a born soldier.

939
02:00:24,283 --> 02:00:27,081
I got trapped.

940
02:00:27,153 --> 02:00:29,087
You may find me facetious
from time to time...

941
02:00:29,155 --> 02:00:31,589
but if I didn't make some
rather bad jokes every now and then...

942
02:00:31,657 --> 02:00:34,217
I'd go out of my mind.

943
02:00:34,293 --> 02:00:36,818
No, I prefer to leave the killing
to someone like you...

944
02:00:36,896 --> 02:00:40,195
an officer and a gentleman,
a leader of men, a hero.

945
02:00:40,266 --> 02:00:43,429
If you think I enjoy this,
you're out of your mind!

946
02:00:43,502 --> 02:00:46,062
I never wanted it.
I was trapped into it just like you.

947
02:00:46,138 --> 02:00:47,730
Just like anybody else
in a uniform.

948
02:00:47,807 --> 02:00:49,866
Of course you wanted it.
You're an officer, aren't you?

949
02:00:49,942 --> 02:00:53,571
I never let them make me an officer.
I don't want the responsibility.

950
02:00:53,646 --> 02:00:56,547
Then you've had a free ride
all this time.

951
02:00:56,616 --> 02:01:00,052
Someone's got to take responsibility
if the job's going to get done.

952
02:01:00,119 --> 02:01:01,381
Think that's easy?

953
02:01:01,454 --> 02:01:04,514
I don't know!

954
02:01:04,590 --> 02:01:08,549
I'm wondering who really is responsible
when it comes to the dirty work.

955
02:01:08,628 --> 02:01:12,428
Who really is guilty: The man who gives
the order, or the one who does it?

956
02:01:12,498 --> 02:01:15,763
- We've no time for this.
- Now just a minute!

957
02:01:15,835 --> 02:01:20,169
If we're going to get this job done,
she has got to be killed.

958
02:01:20,239 --> 02:01:24,107
And we all know how keen you are
on getting the job done.

959
02:01:24,176 --> 02:01:25,643
I can't speak for the others...

960
02:01:25,711 --> 02:01:28,703
but I've never killed a woman before,
traitor or not, and I'm finicky.

961
02:01:28,781 --> 02:01:31,306
So why don't you do it?

962
02:01:31,384 --> 02:01:34,376
Why don't you let us off for once?

963
02:01:34,453 --> 02:01:37,684
Come on, be a pal.
Be a father to your men.

964
02:01:37,757 --> 02:01:40,487
Come down off that cross of yours,
close your eyes...

965
02:01:40,559 --> 02:01:42,754
think of England
and pull the trigger.

966
02:01:42,828 --> 02:01:44,261
What do you say, sir?

967
02:03:07,613 --> 02:03:11,208
You all know what you're supposed to do.
Get started.

968
02:03:11,283 --> 02:03:13,979
Brown, you go with Maria.

969
02:03:44,350 --> 02:03:48,514
Now Miller, you know that when you put
on a uniform and learn how to do it...

970
02:03:48,587 --> 02:03:50,282
it's not hard to kill someone,
anyone.

971
02:03:50,356 --> 02:03:53,757
Sometimes it's harder not to.

972
02:03:53,826 --> 02:03:58,126
Now you think that you've been getting
away with it all this time, standing by.

973
02:03:58,197 --> 02:04:02,861
Well, son, your bystanding days
are over.

974
02:04:02,935 --> 02:04:05,904
You're in it now,
up to your neck.

975
02:04:05,971 --> 02:04:08,439
They told me that you're a genius
with explosives.

976
02:04:08,507 --> 02:04:10,441
Start proving it.

977
02:04:10,509 --> 02:04:12,943
You got me in the mood
to use this thing...

978
02:04:13,012 --> 02:04:15,879
and by God, if you don't think
of something, I'll use it on you.

979
02:04:17,450 --> 02:04:20,578
I mean it. Go on.

980
02:10:12,204 --> 02:10:13,603
You stay here.

981
02:10:13,672 --> 02:10:17,472
- I'll call you if I need you.
- Whatever you say, sir.

982
02:17:33,979 --> 02:17:35,913
Detonator, sir, please.

983
02:17:40,585 --> 02:17:43,349
I'll be finished here
in about 30 seconds.

984
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:50,654
Yes, what is it?

985
02:18:59,764 --> 02:19:01,163
What are you doing?

986
02:19:01,232 --> 02:19:03,496
The first place they're going to search
are those guns.

987
02:19:03,568 --> 02:19:06,833
They'll probably find my stuff.
They're not stupid, you know.

988
02:19:06,905 --> 02:19:09,499
If they should be the slightest bit
careless when they're removing it...

989
02:19:09,574 --> 02:19:11,769
they could bring about
exactly the same result.

990
02:19:11,843 --> 02:19:14,539
Just the same, this is the job
I'm banking on. This is our insurance.

991
02:19:14,612 --> 02:19:18,048
- What happens? - Would you
mind bringing down the hoist?

992
02:19:28,360 --> 02:19:29,793
Whoa, that's enough!

993
02:19:29,861 --> 02:19:32,022
Now, you see this bottom runner?

994
02:19:32,097 --> 02:19:34,395
The first time they send this hoist
down for shells or charges...

995
02:19:34,466 --> 02:19:36,400
this runner should come to here.

996
02:19:36,468 --> 02:19:39,801
The moment it does, it'll hit
these two wires, and we get a circuit.

997
02:19:39,871 --> 02:19:42,704
A circuit that will send up
all my plastic explosives here...

998
02:19:42,774 --> 02:19:46,369
plus this little item...

999
02:19:46,444 --> 02:19:48,878
that I borrowed here.

1000
02:19:50,448 --> 02:19:53,315
Of course, they won't see these wires
when I slap on some more grease.

1001
02:19:53,385 --> 02:19:54,909
Are you sure it'll work?

1002
02:19:54,986 --> 02:19:58,786
No guarantee, but the theory's
perfectly feasible.

1003
02:19:58,857 --> 02:20:01,018
But if this stuff does go up...

1004
02:20:01,092 --> 02:20:04,357
then everything else in this place
is going to go right up with it.

1005
02:20:04,429 --> 02:20:06,021
Suppose you don't get a contact.

1006
02:20:07,799 --> 02:20:11,826
Then I shall be responsible for sinking
one of His Majesty's destroyers.

1007
02:20:11,903 --> 02:20:14,565
Maybe the whole lot of 'em.

1008
02:20:14,639 --> 02:20:18,507
I'm sorry, sir. It's the only way
I know to get the job done.

1009
02:20:18,576 --> 02:20:22,012
As you said, I'm in it now.
Up to my neck.

1010
02:20:29,888 --> 02:20:31,822
Hurry up.

1011
02:21:05,990 --> 02:21:09,084
- Go ahead.
- After you, sir. Remember, I can't swim.

1012
02:21:10,328 --> 02:21:12,762
You won't let me drown, will you?

1013
02:24:00,665 --> 02:24:02,565
I can't make it!

1014
02:24:02,634 --> 02:24:04,067
My arm--

1015
02:24:12,276 --> 02:24:14,005
Come on, man, take it!

1016
02:24:15,580 --> 02:24:16,672
Grab it!

1017
02:27:11,155 --> 02:27:13,248
Spiro is dead, isn't he?

1018
02:27:15,159 --> 02:27:16,592
What happened?

1019
02:27:19,430 --> 02:27:21,557
He forgot why we came here.

1020
02:29:56,253 --> 02:29:57,618
Fire!

1021
02:32:51,795 --> 02:32:55,458
And now you're going
back to Crete?

1022
02:32:55,533 --> 02:32:56,966
Yes.

1023
02:32:59,503 --> 02:33:02,438
- Come with us.
- With "us"?

1024
02:33:04,008 --> 02:33:07,444
- With me.
- I must go back.

1025
02:33:07,511 --> 02:33:10,139
You saw what the Germans did
to Mandrakos.

1026
02:33:10,948 --> 02:33:13,940
Navarone will pay heavily
for your success tonight.

1027
02:33:21,725 --> 02:33:23,659
I'll give you a hand.

1028
02:33:24,361 --> 02:33:26,989
I'm going back.

1029
02:33:27,064 --> 02:33:30,932
- The job is finished.
- No. Your job is finished.

1030
02:33:31,001 --> 02:33:34,164
What chance do you think you have
of staying alive back there?

1031
02:33:37,208 --> 02:33:39,301
I'm not so easy to kill.

1032
02:34:19,416 --> 02:34:22,351
Well, the boys on Kheros
will be happy soon.

1033
02:34:24,488 --> 02:34:27,855
It'll be a bit crowded, but
there's nothing like an ocean voyage.

1034
02:34:27,925 --> 02:34:31,452
Fresh air, good food,
deck sports, pretty girls.

1035
02:34:38,702 --> 02:34:41,296
I'd like to offer you
my apologies, sir...

1036
02:34:41,372 --> 02:34:42,634
and my congratulations.

1037
02:34:52,316 --> 02:34:55,251
To tell you the truth,
I didn't think we could do it.

1038
02:34:55,319 --> 02:34:58,254
To tell you the truth,
neither did I.

1039
02:35:11,235 --> 02:35:14,227
<i>To the gallant men</i>

1040
02:35:14,305 --> 02:35:16,239
<i>Mission accomplished</i>

1041
02:35:16,307 --> 02:35:19,606
<i>Farewell, my friends</i>

1042
02:35:19,677 --> 02:35:23,545
<i>And so the legend ends</i>

1043
02:35:23,614 --> 02:35:25,377
<i>Farewell</i>

1044
02:35:25,449 --> 02:35:28,976
<i>Miller, Brown and Mallory</i>

1045
02:35:29,053 --> 02:35:30,782
<i>Young Pappadimos</i>

1046
02:35:30,854 --> 02:35:34,051
<i>Franklin and Stavrou</i>

1047
02:35:34,124 --> 02:35:38,254
<i>Maria</i>
