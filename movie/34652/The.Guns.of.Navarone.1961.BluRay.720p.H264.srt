1
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,844
Greece and the islands
of the Aegean Sea...

2
00:00:53,095 --> 00:00:57,598
...have given birth to many myths
and legends of war and adventure.

3
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:04,105
And these once-proud stones,
these ruined and shattered temples...

4
00:01:04,356 --> 00:01:09,277
...bear witness to the civilization
that flourished and then died here.

5
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:15,158
And of the demigods and heroes
who inspired those legends...

6
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:17,660
...on this sea and these islands.

7
00:01:17,911 --> 00:01:22,206
But though the stage is the same,
ours is a legend of our own times...

8
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:26,586
...and its heroes are not demigods,
but ordinary people.

9
00:01:27,045 --> 00:01:29,922
In 1943, so the story goes...

10
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:33,926
...2000 British soldiers lay
marooned on the island of Kheros...

11
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:36,512
...exhausted and helpless.

12
00:01:37,181 --> 00:01:41,559
They had exactly one week to live.
In Berlin, the Axis had determined...

13
00:01:41,727 --> 00:01:44,353
...on a show of strength
in the Aegean Sea...

14
00:01:44,605 --> 00:01:48,691
...to bully neutral Turkey into
coming into the war on their side.

15
00:01:51,361 --> 00:01:54,113
The scene of that demonstration
was to be Kheros...

16
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:59,327
...itself of no military value,
but only miles off the coast of Turkey.

17
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:03,331
The cream of the German war machine,
rested and ready...

18
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,750
...was to spearhead the attack.

19
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,336
The men on Kheros were doomed...

20
00:02:08,587 --> 00:02:11,798
...unless they could be evacuated
before the blitz.

21
00:02:12,049 --> 00:02:14,467
But the only passage
to and from Kheros...

22
00:02:14,718 --> 00:02:16,886
...was guarded and blocked
by two great...

23
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,972
...newly designed,
radar-controlled guns...

24
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:22,141
...on the nearby island of Navarone.

25
00:02:26,313 --> 00:02:28,105
Guns too powerful and accurate...

26
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:31,651
...for any Allied ship then
in the Aegean to challenge.

27
00:02:41,954 --> 00:02:44,497
Allied Intelligence learned
of the projected blitz...

28
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:47,250
...only one week before
the appointed date.

29
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:51,879
What took place in the next six days
became the legend of Navarone.

30
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:07,908
Yes?

31
00:06:08,118 --> 00:06:09,827
I'm looking for
Commodore Jensen.

32
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,662
I'm Jensen.

33
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:13,789
Come in, Mallory.

34
00:06:17,169 --> 00:06:18,544
You're late.

35
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,719
I'm sorry. Our plane was attacked
an hour out of Crete.

36
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,890
- We got into Alex on one engine, sir.
- The Germans have a price on you...

37
00:06:31,058 --> 00:06:34,643
...and Andrea Stavros
of 10,000 pounds apiece.

38
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,687
How did you know that?

39
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:38,689
I should do. I'm your boss.

40
00:06:39,066 --> 00:06:41,859
You've been working for me
the past 18 months.

41
00:06:42,611 --> 00:06:45,237
I'm delighted to make
your acquaintance.

42
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:47,323
Did they say
you were going on leave?

43
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:48,741
Yes, sir. They did.

44
00:06:48,992 --> 00:06:51,535
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm afraid that's not true.

45
00:06:51,745 --> 00:06:53,245
Not yet, at any rate.

46
00:06:54,498 --> 00:06:57,124
Here's your old chum.
Come and say hello to him.

47
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,543
You haven't changed since Athens.

48
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:01,587
Hello, Roy.

49
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,048
Come along, gentlemen, will you?

50
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:13,891
Barnsby...

51
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,061
...these gentlemen have
an interest in Navarone.

52
00:07:17,646 --> 00:07:22,608
We've heard you on radio, but
perhaps you'll be more specific now.

53
00:07:23,777 --> 00:07:25,277
I'll be specific.

54
00:07:25,904 --> 00:07:28,364
As you can plainly see,
it was bloody awful!

55
00:07:29,074 --> 00:07:31,951
Squadron Leader
Barnsby's Australian.

56
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:34,912
But we'd love to go back,
wouldn't we boys?

57
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,957
- Sure! Right!
- Just as soon as we can! But...

58
00:07:39,126 --> 00:07:41,085
...only on one condition.

59
00:07:41,628 --> 00:07:45,131
We want the joker who thought
of this to come with us...

60
00:07:45,674 --> 00:07:47,466
...and when we get there...

61
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,053
...we're gonna shove him
out at 10,000 feet...

62
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,596
...without a parachute.

63
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,223
Bloody right.

64
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:56,976
- It was bad as that?
- Bad?!

65
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,646
It can't be done.
Not from the air, anyway.

66
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:04,650
You're sure about that,
squadron leader? This is important.

67
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,402
So's my life!

68
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,530
To me, anyway. And the lives
of these jokers here...

69
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,616
...and the 18 men we lost tonight!

70
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:17,163
Look, sir...

71
00:08:17,998 --> 00:08:19,039
...first...

72
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,752
...you've got that old fortress
on top of that bloody cliff.

73
00:08:23,962 --> 00:08:26,422
Then you've got
the bloody cliff overhang.

74
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,176
You can't even see the bloody cave,
let alone the guns.

75
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:34,430
And anyway, we haven't got
a bloody bomb big enough...

76
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,807
...to smash that bloody rock.

77
00:08:37,851 --> 00:08:39,643
And that's the bloody truth, sir.

78
00:08:42,731 --> 00:08:44,440
I know how to hit those guns.

79
00:08:44,608 --> 00:08:45,608
Yes?

80
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:46,942
Yes, sir.

81
00:08:47,444 --> 00:08:49,695
You fill a plane full of TNT...

82
00:08:50,322 --> 00:08:54,617
...and then you do a suicide
dive right into that cave.

83
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:57,369
There's just one problem, sir:

84
00:08:58,038 --> 00:09:00,789
Getting someone to pilot the plane.

85
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:06,795
I see. Perhaps you might
consider it yourself.

86
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:11,800
Thank you, squadron leader,
and all of you.

87
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:16,013
I know you've done your best,
and nobody could have done more.

88
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:18,224
And I'm sorry.

89
00:09:26,024 --> 00:09:30,861
As you've probably surmised, I'm the
joker they'd heave out at 10,000 feet.

90
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,988
And I can't say I blame them.

91
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:36,533
I knew it was hopeless from the start,
but it had to be tried.

92
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:40,412
Anyway, this is why you
were hauled out of Crete.

93
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,586
And don't mislay this, will you?

94
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:48,796
No, sir.

95
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:52,508
We're pressed for time.
Let's go, gentlemen, shall we?

96
00:10:05,814 --> 00:10:08,190
- Any questions?
- Only one.

97
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,192
Why me?

98
00:10:12,195 --> 00:10:15,114
What you want is
a seagoing taxi driver.

99
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,950
Other men know these waters
as well as I do.

100
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:20,369
Yes, but you've got
special qualifications.

101
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,580
Franklin'll explain it.
It's his idea, anyway.

102
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,959
First, you speak Greek and German.

103
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:31,171
Second, you've kept alive in occupied
territory for a year and a half.

104
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:36,218
And before the war, you were the
greatest mountain climber in the world.

105
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:38,429
"Keith Mallory, the human fly."

106
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:39,888
Come to the point, Roy.

107
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:43,600
The point is that our Resistance
contacts on Navarone...

108
00:10:43,810 --> 00:10:47,604
...say there's only one spot on
the coast the Germans don't watch:

109
00:10:47,856 --> 00:10:50,607
The South Cliff.
It's 400 feet straight up...

110
00:10:50,859 --> 00:10:53,777
...and it can't be climbed
by man or beast.

111
00:10:54,321 --> 00:10:56,322
And that's where you come in.

112
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:58,615
That was your idea too?

113
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:00,159
That's right.

114
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:05,289
I want you to get me and my team
over there and on top of that cliff.

115
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:09,126
When you've done that, you can
take a richly deserved leave...

116
00:11:09,753 --> 00:11:11,795
...and a long-overdue promotion.

117
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,505
I see.

118
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,441
Can you do it?

119
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,780
No.

120
00:11:38,323 --> 00:11:41,533
With all due respect,
I think the operation is insane.

121
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:43,827
But that's not my business.

122
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:47,831
My business is to climb
and I haven't climbed in five years.

123
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,042
That's a long time.

124
00:11:50,502 --> 00:11:52,878
It's too long for this cliff.

125
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:55,756
And you're asking me
to do it at night.

126
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:01,929
I wouldn't try it in broad daylight.

127
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:05,474
I'll have a go myself, then.
I've climbed a bit.

128
00:12:05,642 --> 00:12:10,229
Don't be a fool. You'd get yourself
killed and your team along with you.

129
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,273
- Then it's scrubbed?
- No, it's not scrubbed!

130
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,817
It can't be.

131
00:12:16,528 --> 00:12:17,569
Not now.

132
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:21,740
Mallory...

133
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:25,160
...this is our last hope.

134
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:30,499
The Germans won't expect
a team of saboteurs at this late date.

135
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:34,503
Those 2000 men on Kheros will
die next Wednesday morning...

136
00:12:34,671 --> 00:12:36,505
...unless somebody climbs the cliff.

137
00:12:36,673 --> 00:12:40,175
There's nobody else
we can get in time.

138
00:12:42,846 --> 00:12:45,389
If there were,
you wouldn't be here now.

139
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:04,950
I suppose it's too late to get
Andrea Stavros to help me.

140
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:06,785
On the contrary.

141
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:11,039
I think you'll find him waiting
for you in your hotel.

142
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:15,752
You think of everything.

143
00:13:15,962 --> 00:13:18,547
I have to. It's part of my job.

144
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,216
- Thanks, Keith.
- It's my pleasure.

145
00:13:21,885 --> 00:13:24,887
Nothing I like better
than a well-organized setup.

146
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:27,306
You'll want to know about the team.

147
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:30,517
Sydney, would you get us
some more coffee, please?

148
00:13:31,144 --> 00:13:35,063
Franklin considers it the best team
in the business. I agree.

149
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,818
He himself is ideal for the job. He's
experienced and extremely capable.

150
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:41,445
Don't blush, Roy.

151
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,531
And best of all, he's lucky.
Aren't you lucky?

152
00:13:44,699 --> 00:13:46,992
- If you say so, sir.
- I do, indeed.

153
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:50,662
Napoleon said once, when somebody
was up for promotion to general:

154
00:13:50,914 --> 00:13:53,749
"Yes, I know he's brilliant.
But is he lucky?"

155
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:57,628
The emperor knew the value of luck.
Our Roy seems to have it.

156
00:13:57,837 --> 00:14:01,507
- Then make me a general, sir.
- Patience, my dear boy, patience.

157
00:14:02,133 --> 00:14:06,303
Now this is our Corporal Miller.
A chemistry professor in private life.

158
00:14:06,513 --> 00:14:08,931
An absolute genius
with high explosives.

159
00:14:09,182 --> 00:14:11,141
He blew up Rommel's headquarters...

160
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:14,269
...with no damage
to the orphanage next door.

161
00:14:14,437 --> 00:14:17,814
They don't come any better. We tried
to make him an officer. He refused.

162
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,360
This is "Butcher" Brown,
our mechanical marvel.

163
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,280
He's a genius with engines,
machinery, radios, et cetera.

164
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:28,158
And the best man with a knife
I've ever met.

165
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:33,539
He got his training in Spain. The boys
call him the Butcher of Barcelona.

166
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,292
Private Spyro Pappadimos.

167
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:42,214
What's his particular genius?

168
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:46,969
He's a born killer. A useful man
to have along on a job like this.

169
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:51,890
His father happens to be our chief
resistance contact on Navarone.

170
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,726
The boy went to America
to get an education.

171
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:57,479
I'm afraid he got the wrong kind.

172
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,690
Well, there's the team.

173
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,442
Pirates and cutthroats,
every one of them.

174
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:04,820
And of course, there's Lucky here.

175
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:08,156
And the redoubtable Mr. Stavros
and yourself.

176
00:15:09,117 --> 00:15:11,994
With every one of us a genius,
how can we fail?

177
00:15:12,161 --> 00:15:13,328
You can't.

178
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,874
We're sending six destroyers through
the Navarone Channel next Tuesday...

179
00:15:18,126 --> 00:15:19,543
...to take the men off Kheros.

180
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:22,212
If those guns aren't spiked by then...

181
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:25,757
...there'll be six more ships
at the bottom of the Aegean.

182
00:15:29,846 --> 00:15:31,847
There's your car, gentlemen.

183
00:15:47,363 --> 00:15:48,363
Surprised?

184
00:15:49,407 --> 00:15:52,075
I didn't think I'd see you again
so soon.

185
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:54,244
You thought you'd have
to look for me?

186
00:15:55,038 --> 00:15:57,289
When the time came,
I would find you.

187
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:02,586
What is this?

188
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:08,925
We have to ferry some operators
to an island called Navarone.

189
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:12,512
- Do you know it?
- I know it.

190
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:16,391
I also know I have
work to do on Crete.

191
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:20,479
- Who's responsible for this?
- A major I used to know.

192
00:16:21,898 --> 00:16:23,190
Name of Franklin.

193
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:27,694
He's a man who still has to prove
to himself he's a hero.

194
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,405
I'll speak to Franklin.
Where do I find him?

195
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:33,909
That's the man.

196
00:16:35,203 --> 00:16:37,496
You can speak with him on the way.

197
00:16:51,260 --> 00:16:52,844
Think they've got a chance?

198
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,305
Frankly, no.

199
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,557
Not a chance in the world.

200
00:17:01,104 --> 00:17:03,855
I'll be surprised if they
get halfway to Navarone.

201
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:06,483
It's just a waste of six good men.

202
00:17:06,734 --> 00:17:11,697
However, it doesn't matter, considering
how many have been wasted already.

203
00:17:16,077 --> 00:17:18,161
I'm glad it's not my decision.

204
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:20,455
I'm only the middleman.

205
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:27,796
Still, they may get there
and they may pull it off.

206
00:17:28,047 --> 00:17:31,967
Anything can happen in a war.
In the middle of absolute insanity...

207
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:34,553
...people pull out
extraordinary resources.

208
00:17:34,804 --> 00:17:38,056
Ingenuity, courage, self-sacrifice.

209
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,769
Pity we can't beat the problems
of peace in the same way.

210
00:17:44,105 --> 00:17:45,981
It would be so much cheaper.

211
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:49,025
I never thought of it
in just that way.

212
00:17:49,986 --> 00:17:52,320
- You're a philosopher.
- No.

213
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:56,908
I'm just the man who has to send
people out on jobs like this one.

214
00:18:34,906 --> 00:18:37,824
Must have been delayed.
I'm sure he'll be here soon.

215
00:18:58,095 --> 00:18:59,554
- Major Franklin?
- Right.

216
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:03,058
My name's Baker. Sorry I was delayed.
Come with me, please.

217
00:19:03,434 --> 00:19:06,186
It's been so comfortable,
I hate to leave.

218
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:12,859
When you're all quite ready...

219
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:35,465
Charming.
Just like an English country hotel.

220
00:19:35,633 --> 00:19:37,217
Where does everybody else sleep?

221
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,846
Nobody sleeps. On your feet,
professor. We've got homework to do.

222
00:19:41,097 --> 00:19:42,722
If you insist, major.

223
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,601
What are you doing, friend?
Looking for dust?

224
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,603
No, friend. Microphones.

225
00:19:48,771 --> 00:19:51,106
This is the British Army Post.
Don't you trust anyone?

226
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:54,109
No. That is why I have lived so long.

227
00:19:54,318 --> 00:19:59,447
Mr. Stavros is Colonel Stavros
of the Greek 19th Motorized Regiment.

228
00:19:59,866 --> 00:20:01,908
- He outranks us all.
- It is of no moment.

229
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,371
The 19th Regiment no longer exists,
for the time being.

230
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,624
- I beg your pardon, colonel.
- Andrea.

231
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:12,127
Please continue.

232
00:20:12,378 --> 00:20:14,713
Right. If you're ready, corporal.

233
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:16,423
Yes, sir. Ready, sir.

234
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,341
Ready, willing and able, sir.

235
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,468
Champing at the bit.

236
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,471
Captain Mallory and Andrea...

237
00:20:23,723 --> 00:20:26,558
...are responsible for getting us
to where we're going.

238
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,227
I'll tell you where it is,
and why we're going.

239
00:20:29,478 --> 00:20:32,147
That is, if you really want
to know, professor.

240
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:34,482
I'm all ears, sir. All ears.

241
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,446
We must avoid the coast road.
That means a 12-mile trek...

242
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:44,326
...to St. Alexis, where Resistance
people from the town of Mandrakos...

243
00:20:44,702 --> 00:20:47,329
...will come and meet us
if they can make it.

244
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:48,997
Any questions?

245
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,875
I have an alternative route
to that place.

246
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:54,002
May I borrow your pencil, please?

247
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:00,258
Does the major think
this is possible?

248
00:21:01,636 --> 00:21:02,677
I see.

249
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:04,554
That's a thought, isn't it?

250
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:09,225
Well, let's re-examine the plan
and see if we have any alternative.

251
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:13,104
Watch out!

252
00:21:17,193 --> 00:21:20,737
- How long has he been there?
- I heard something 10 minutes ago.

253
00:21:20,947 --> 00:21:23,448
I thought my ears were playing tricks.
Then I heard it again.

254
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,451
Ten minutes?
Brown, go and get Major Baker.

255
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:27,827
Yes, sir.

256
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,705
What's your name?
What are you doing here?

257
00:21:31,374 --> 00:21:34,459
The major asked you a question!
Answer the major.

258
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:41,216
Sounds like Kurdish.
I don't understand it.

259
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:42,801
I'll try Greek.

260
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:54,229
- Translation, please.
- He doesn't speak English.

261
00:21:54,438 --> 00:21:55,814
Why was he listening?

262
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:00,610
- What are you doing to that man?
- You know him?

263
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:04,739
That's Nicolai, our laundry boy.
Is he the reason I've been disturbed?

264
00:22:04,991 --> 00:22:06,408
I've had a hard day!

265
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:08,660
Does his job involve
listening at keyholes?

266
00:22:08,911 --> 00:22:10,787
- I don't believe it.
- We caught him at it.

267
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,665
It was just idle curiosity.
He doesn't speak English.

268
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:17,544
Why does he listen?
And why did he try to stab this man?

269
00:22:17,795 --> 00:22:19,963
I presume he was trying
to defend himself.

270
00:22:20,256 --> 00:22:24,968
In this part of the world, carrying a
knife doesn't make you a criminal.

271
00:22:25,219 --> 00:22:26,261
Let him go.

272
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:31,516
Major Baker, arrest this man and
hold him incommunicado for a week.

273
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:35,270
After that, my advice is you
kick him out of Castelrosso.

274
00:22:35,438 --> 00:22:38,148
Who the hell are you to give
me advice, major?

275
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:42,652
Then I'm asking you as a favor.

276
00:22:42,862 --> 00:22:44,362
I'll consider it.

277
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:47,866
All this cloak-and-dagger stuff.
I said, let him go!

278
00:22:48,075 --> 00:22:49,868
Pappadimos,
have you got your silencer?

279
00:22:50,036 --> 00:22:52,495
- Yes, sir.
- Then use it. Shoot the laundry boy!

280
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:53,705
Are you crazy?

281
00:22:53,914 --> 00:22:57,292
And if the major gets
in your way, shoot him too.

282
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,335
That's an order.

283
00:23:07,970 --> 00:23:11,181
Captain, he's insane!
Surely you won't let him do this.

284
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:14,392
I can't stop him, he's in charge.
Anyway, I agree with him.

285
00:23:14,810 --> 00:23:17,312
Of course, he doesn't have
to shoot you.

286
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:22,567
He can just call our HQ and you'll
be on a troopship home, as a private...

287
00:23:25,154 --> 00:23:29,240
...unless you give him your word that
you'll do exactly as he says.

288
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:38,750
All right.

289
00:23:39,543 --> 00:23:41,836
If it means that much to you,
you have my word.

290
00:23:42,004 --> 00:23:43,588
Take him, sergeant!

291
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,219
Stupid theatricals.

292
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,846
You're entitled to your opinion...

293
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,599
...but I just saved your life.

294
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,374
I'm desperately sorry, gentlemen.
Really, I am.

295
00:24:19,625 --> 00:24:22,085
It's embarrassing.
Just look at it!

296
00:24:22,378 --> 00:24:24,254
No, it's exactly what we want.

297
00:24:24,672 --> 00:24:28,508
They said you wanted a boat no one
would notice, but that's a disgrace!

298
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:32,637
Give me 36 hours,
and I know I can lay my hands...

299
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:36,182
...on a German E-boat
in absolutely perfect condition.

300
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:38,893
I promise you,
only one careful owner.

301
00:24:39,145 --> 00:24:41,271
I can pop over to Rhodes
and get it for you.

302
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:43,898
Won't the Germans have
something to say about that?

303
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,650
I suppose so, if they knew.

304
00:24:45,901 --> 00:24:49,112
But I've got good connections there.
What do you say?

305
00:24:49,405 --> 00:24:51,573
- No, thanks. We can't wait.
- Pity.

306
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:54,742
I'll get my chaps
to help with your gear.

307
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:57,287
No, that's all right, thank you.

308
00:24:57,705 --> 00:24:59,247
Right. I get it.

309
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:03,001
Special cargo and all that, what?
Well, good luck to you.

310
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:11,843
Brown?

311
00:25:12,595 --> 00:25:13,595
Yes, sir?

312
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,471
What do you think?

313
00:25:16,682 --> 00:25:19,017
Well, she's a bit of a monster, sir.

314
00:25:19,268 --> 00:25:21,102
But I think I've got her worried.

315
00:25:24,857 --> 00:25:27,025
- Comfortable, professor?
- Yes, thank you.

316
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:29,819
Matter of fact,
the boys have almost finished.

317
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:32,572
Permission to speak?

318
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:36,326
- What about?
- Well, the condition of this vessel.

319
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:40,663
Talk to Captain Mallory.
He's in charge of transportation.

320
00:25:40,831 --> 00:25:41,873
Very good, sir.

321
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:46,794
I've inspected this boat
and I think you ought to know...

322
00:25:46,962 --> 00:25:48,004
...I can't swim.

323
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:51,007
I'll keep it in mind.

324
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,152
Dead on 10, sir.

325
00:26:15,199 --> 00:26:17,825
Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.

326
00:26:18,035 --> 00:26:21,579
Report my signal. Report my signal.

327
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:24,123
Hello, George-Mike-William.
George-Mike-William.

328
00:26:24,375 --> 00:26:27,252
Strength three. Strength three, over.

329
00:26:27,503 --> 00:26:28,670
Hello, Lucky.

330
00:26:29,129 --> 00:26:33,049
High Flight reports Indians on warpath
in your territory.

331
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:35,176
So please be careful.

332
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:39,514
Also, severe storms expected
throughout your area tonight.

333
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:43,518
Repeat. High Flight reports
Indians on warpath...

334
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:07,667
Hey.

335
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:01,888
Ship ahoy!

336
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,732
Go on working.
They'll have glasses.

337
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:13,501
Lower your sails!

338
00:29:14,002 --> 00:29:16,212
We are coming aboard!

339
00:33:28,215 --> 00:33:31,801
It's knee-deep in the hold,
but I think we'll manage.

340
00:33:33,178 --> 00:33:34,345
You want a breather?

341
00:33:34,596 --> 00:33:36,097
Wouldn't mind.

342
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:47,024
Funny the way that German officer
spoke English to us back there...

343
00:33:47,943 --> 00:33:50,152
...almost as if he knew who we were.

344
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:52,363
I had the same thought.

345
00:33:54,825 --> 00:33:58,285
I think our friend Baker
may have some explaining to do.

346
00:33:58,537 --> 00:33:59,870
I shouldn't have done it.

347
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,163
What's that?

348
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,124
Dragged you into this.

349
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:04,625
I'm sorry.

350
00:34:04,793 --> 00:34:07,878
Forget it. I was getting tired
of Crete food anyway.

351
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:10,172
No, I'm stupid sometimes.

352
00:34:10,674 --> 00:34:14,552
Even as a kid, I'd expect
people to play the games I liked.

353
00:34:14,803 --> 00:34:16,971
Then I'd get furious when they didn't.

354
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,558
Well, now they have to,
so why worry?

355
00:34:45,250 --> 00:34:46,292
Hot coffee!

356
00:34:46,501 --> 00:34:48,169
That's good.

357
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,719
I'm sorry, captain.

358
00:34:57,012 --> 00:35:00,139
There's a serious shortage of cups
aboard this ship.

359
00:35:01,308 --> 00:35:03,768
I pointed out deficiencies
in this vessel.

360
00:35:04,019 --> 00:35:05,144
I remember.

361
00:35:10,192 --> 00:35:12,109
- Thanks.
- My pleasure.

362
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:19,325
Any time you want another chat,
about this boat, I mean, I'm available.

363
00:35:19,576 --> 00:35:20,743
All right.

364
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,834
And I still can't swim.

365
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,134
Don't mind him.
He doesn't mean anything.

366
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:41,138
I don't mind him as much
as he seems to mind me.

367
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:45,643
Have you been together long?

368
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:47,812
Since the beginning out here.

369
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:50,689
He's the best friend I have
in this part of the world.

370
00:35:56,696 --> 00:36:00,115
That's a pretty good partner
you've got there yourself.

371
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:01,575
Yes.

372
00:36:05,372 --> 00:36:08,249
- We've been together a long time too.
- You're lucky.

373
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,799
He's going to kill me
when the war's over.

374
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,471
- You're not serious.
- Yes, I am.

375
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:26,350
So's he.

376
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,694
About a year ago, I gave
a German patrol a safe conduct...

377
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:39,113
...to get their wounded into hospital.

378
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:43,659
I still had some romantic notions
about fighting a civilized war.

379
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:48,247
Anyway, they wanted Andrea
pretty badly even then.

380
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:52,626
They shot their casualties,
went to his house and blew it up.

381
00:36:52,961 --> 00:36:57,840
He was out on a job, but his wife
and three children were in the house.

382
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:02,219
They were all killed.

383
00:37:02,888 --> 00:37:04,930
I helped him to bury them.

384
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:09,977
He didn't say a word to me.
Never looked at me.

385
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:14,940
But after it was over, he said that
as far as he was concerned...

386
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:19,570
...it wasn't the Germans who were
responsible, but me.

387
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,908
Me and my stupid
Anglo-Saxon decency.

388
00:37:27,162 --> 00:37:29,371
He said what he
was going to do, and when.

389
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,041
Do you think he still means to do it?

390
00:37:35,045 --> 00:37:38,839
He's from Crete.
Those people don't make idle threats.

391
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:44,887
I thought I was getting leave.

392
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:48,182
I was going to ask for
transfer to another area.

393
00:37:48,391 --> 00:37:51,810
Take some time to think,
get ready for him.

394
00:37:52,354 --> 00:37:53,854
And I messed that up.

395
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,814
I'm sorry.

396
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:58,233
That's all right.

397
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,569
It's gonna be a long war.

398
00:38:01,696 --> 00:38:04,365
What makes you sure
he's gonna wait that long?

399
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,577
I'm not. Not if he gets
the right opportunity.

400
00:38:13,959 --> 00:38:17,920
What I'm banking on is, that now
all he wants to do is to kill Germans.

401
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:22,967
As long as I can be useful to him
in that department...

402
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:25,844
...he'll do his best to keep me alive.

403
00:38:26,554 --> 00:38:27,554
I hope.

404
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,598
That's nice of him.

405
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:32,810
Well, I can see his point.

406
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:38,941
The only way to win a war is to be
just as nasty as the enemy.

407
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:43,487
I'm only worried we'll find out
we're even nastier than they are.

408
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:45,656
I can't say that worries me.

409
00:38:45,907 --> 00:38:47,116
Well, you're lucky.

410
00:38:59,504 --> 00:39:01,922
Think I better
have a look at the hold.

411
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,510
Before Miller tells me to!

412
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:36,736
Help!

413
00:54:20,799 --> 00:54:22,592
We've saved the explosives...

414
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:24,010
...the guns...

415
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:26,137
...and most of the ammunition.

416
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:32,143
I'm afraid we've lost the food
and the medical supplies.

417
00:54:32,353 --> 00:54:34,938
But if we rendezvous with
the Resistance...

418
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:37,732
...at St. Alexis,
they'll supply us with both.

419
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,027
Let's get out of this place
as quickly as we can.

420
00:54:42,029 --> 00:54:46,699
Pappadimos and Miller, you'll have
the first shift with the stretcher.

421
00:54:47,701 --> 00:54:50,286
You're officially
taking command, sir?

422
00:54:52,414 --> 00:54:54,207
Yes, I suppose I am. Why?

423
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,209
Just for the record.

424
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,396
This afternoon on the boat...

425
00:55:17,815 --> 00:55:19,899
...you fumbled your job.

426
00:55:21,026 --> 00:55:22,902
How'd that happen?

427
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,114
I don't know, sir.

428
00:55:27,282 --> 00:55:30,910
The man was a foot away from you.
You only wounded him.

429
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:32,578
How could you miss?

430
00:55:34,915 --> 00:55:36,749
I must have hesitated, sir.

431
00:55:37,334 --> 00:55:38,960
You hesitated?

432
00:55:39,712 --> 00:55:41,713
A man of your experience?

433
00:55:42,423 --> 00:55:44,507
The Butcher of Barcelona?

434
00:55:45,009 --> 00:55:47,093
How could you hesitate?

435
00:55:48,137 --> 00:55:49,595
Well, I was tired.

436
00:55:51,140 --> 00:55:52,932
I'm tired and I'm fed up.

437
00:55:53,767 --> 00:55:56,102
I've been fighting this war
a long time.

438
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:00,648
I've been killing Germans since 1937.
There's no end to them.

439
00:56:00,858 --> 00:56:03,276
Shoot a man at 200 yards,
he's just a target.

440
00:56:03,444 --> 00:56:05,278
You kill him with a knife...

441
00:56:06,155 --> 00:56:08,156
...you're close enough to smell him.

442
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:11,117
I smell them in my sleep.

443
00:56:12,745 --> 00:56:16,748
After the last time, I made a pact
with myself: I'd do my job.

444
00:56:17,541 --> 00:56:19,625
But I wouldn't do the other anymore.

445
00:56:20,502 --> 00:56:22,128
Not if I could help it.

446
00:56:22,838 --> 00:56:26,132
And who gave you the right
to make a private peace?

447
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,886
You think you're
the only one who's tired?

448
00:56:30,137 --> 00:56:31,554
I do my job, sir!

449
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:34,682
Your job is to kill enemy soldiers.

450
00:57:10,844 --> 00:57:13,679
There will, of course,
be a code word.

451
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:17,183
If we don't answer, a patrol
will be here in no time.

452
00:57:49,216 --> 00:57:51,092
Let's pack and get out.

453
00:58:17,870 --> 00:58:18,953
Let's go.

454
00:58:21,081 --> 00:58:22,248
Well?

455
00:58:26,003 --> 00:58:28,296
The major's leg is broken
in two places.

456
00:58:28,589 --> 00:58:31,674
He could be hurt inside too.
He needs medical attention.

457
00:58:31,884 --> 00:58:33,092
What do you suggest?

458
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:36,762
- Leave him for the Germans.
- They'd get him to a hospital.

459
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:41,100
If he doesn't get sulphanilamide,
he doesn't stand a chance.

460
00:58:41,268 --> 00:58:44,395
Naturally, you all think a lot
of Major Franklin. So do I.

461
00:58:44,605 --> 00:58:46,439
We have two choices.

462
00:58:47,107 --> 00:58:50,234
We can take him,
and if he doesn't get help, he'll die.

463
00:58:50,402 --> 00:58:54,488
Or we can leave him here,
and he'll tell the Germans everything.

464
00:58:54,907 --> 00:58:56,616
Roy? Never!

465
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,035
He might not be able to help himself.

466
00:58:59,286 --> 00:59:01,537
They have other drugs
besides sulpha.

467
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:06,876
All they have to do is use scopolamine,
and he'll tell them our whole plan.

468
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,504
There is, of course, a third choice.

469
00:59:10,714 --> 00:59:13,966
One bullet now. Better for him.
Better for us.

470
00:59:14,218 --> 00:59:17,011
You take that man along,
you endanger us all.

471
00:59:17,221 --> 00:59:19,472
Why not drop him off the cliff
and save a bullet?

472
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,682
And why don't you shut up?

473
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,478
Yes, there's a third choice.

474
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:28,147
We'll make it if necessary...

475
00:59:28,815 --> 00:59:30,483
...when it's necessary...

476
00:59:30,817 --> 00:59:31,984
...and not before!

477
00:59:33,987 --> 00:59:35,071
Now let's move!

478
00:59:35,656 --> 00:59:40,243
Brown, from now on your job is
to look after Major Franklin.

479
00:59:43,330 --> 00:59:45,039
I said, move!

480
01:00:53,233 --> 01:00:54,525
Morning!

481
01:00:57,404 --> 01:00:58,446
I'm sorry.

482
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:01,240
Don't be silly. It's just bad luck.

483
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,327
Well, what do we do now?

484
01:01:05,245 --> 01:01:06,287
Where are we?

485
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,039
We're on our way.

486
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,418
- I'm going to hold you up.
- No, you won't.

487
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:17,256
Anyway, the professor won the toss
and he's dying to carry you.

488
01:01:17,549 --> 01:01:20,593
That's right. You're not
nearly as heavy as I thought.

489
01:01:20,927 --> 01:01:21,969
Now look...

490
01:01:23,555 --> 01:01:25,431
...you've got to leave me.

491
01:01:25,766 --> 01:01:27,475
You're out of your mind.

492
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:29,852
It's radio time.

493
01:01:30,604 --> 01:01:33,105
Well, it's all on your plate now.

494
01:01:35,317 --> 01:01:38,110
You'll never be able
to thank me enough.

495
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,781
I wanted the job all the time.

496
01:02:06,932 --> 01:02:09,475
Hello, Lucky. Hello, Lucky.

497
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:11,477
Report my signal.

498
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,979
Hello, George-Mike-William.
George-Mike-William.

499
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,690
Strength four. Strength four, over.

500
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:20,111
Hello, Lucky. This is most urgent.

501
01:02:20,320 --> 01:02:23,656
Paddington Station will close
at midnight, X minus one.

502
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:27,827
Do you understand?
X minus one, over.

503
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,204
We've lost a full day.

504
01:02:32,999 --> 01:02:35,835
Germans are gonna hit Kheros
a day ahead of time.

505
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,257
Gives us until midnight,
the day after tomorrow.

506
01:02:44,177 --> 01:02:47,513
Message understood.
Message understood. Over and out.

507
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:35,895
I'd like to be alone with the major.

508
01:04:06,927 --> 01:04:08,928
Roy, that was foolish.

509
01:04:11,097 --> 01:04:15,100
You almost ruined everything.
We've just heard, we're canceled out.

510
01:04:17,103 --> 01:04:18,604
Scrubbed.

511
01:04:18,897 --> 01:04:19,939
What?

512
01:04:20,524 --> 01:04:24,527
They're going for an amphibious
landing the day after tomorrow...

513
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:27,363
...on the east coast.

514
01:04:29,115 --> 01:04:30,282
The Turkish side.

515
01:04:31,326 --> 01:04:32,535
The Turkish side?

516
01:04:33,828 --> 01:04:36,288
And they're coming in force.

517
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:39,625
As far as we're concerned,
the pressure's off.

518
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:43,212
All we have to do is
make as much trouble as we can.

519
01:04:43,463 --> 01:04:46,298
By tonight, we'll have you
in the hands of the underground.

520
01:04:47,342 --> 01:04:49,134
We'll have you taken care of.

521
01:04:55,308 --> 01:04:58,561
Try this again, I'll have Andrea
break your other leg.

522
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,337
Good luck.

523
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:27,506
Do not worry.

524
01:05:27,882 --> 01:05:30,759
I shall see you tonight at St. Alexis.

525
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:32,965
Good evening, gentlemen.

526
01:07:36,553 --> 01:07:39,471
Obviously, this place
has been used before.

527
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,809
Any food around?

528
01:07:45,103 --> 01:07:47,146
I regret to say no.

529
01:07:48,815 --> 01:07:52,109
Weren't you careless?
We might have been anyone.

530
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:55,404
I heard you coming five minutes ago.

531
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:02,786
No.

532
01:08:04,164 --> 01:08:05,414
No!

533
01:08:10,754 --> 01:08:13,797
Pappadimos,
it's time to relieve Andrea.

534
01:08:14,549 --> 01:08:15,591
I'll take it.

535
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:16,967
No.

536
01:08:20,054 --> 01:08:21,305
Pappadimos...

537
01:08:21,556 --> 01:08:22,806
...you go.

538
01:09:28,832 --> 01:09:31,083
- Maybe he brought food.
- Hold it.

539
01:09:31,376 --> 01:09:32,835
He might be faking.

540
01:09:40,718 --> 01:09:42,135
Saved!

541
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:50,811
Don't move!

542
01:09:52,772 --> 01:09:54,106
Raise your hands!

543
01:09:55,441 --> 01:09:56,984
Raise your hands high!

544
01:09:57,944 --> 01:09:59,194
All of you!

545
01:10:00,613 --> 01:10:03,115
You there, with the food, speak!

546
01:10:09,497 --> 01:10:11,164
You are not Germans.

547
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,294
Which of you is Major Franklin?

548
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,214
The man on the stretcher.
Who are you?

549
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,675
My name is Maria Pappadimos.

550
01:10:24,470 --> 01:10:27,139
You may put your hands
down now, gentlemen.

551
01:10:33,980 --> 01:10:35,230
Pappadimos?

552
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:38,400
They said Pappadimos was a man.

553
01:10:38,651 --> 01:10:41,153
My father.
He was taken two days ago.

554
01:10:41,362 --> 01:10:42,696
He was taken?

555
01:10:43,197 --> 01:10:44,990
He told them nothing.

556
01:10:45,491 --> 01:10:46,825
He will die first.

557
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:50,746
- You have sisters or brothers?
- A brother, Spyro, in America.

558
01:10:55,168 --> 01:10:57,628
Oh, he's not as far away as all that.

559
01:10:59,547 --> 01:11:02,174
He's that handsome devil
right over there.

560
01:11:10,224 --> 01:11:11,266
Spyro!

561
01:11:15,521 --> 01:11:16,855
Why did you do that for?

562
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:20,150
To remind you to write letters
occasionally.

563
01:11:20,360 --> 01:11:23,278
- There's a war on!
- I mean before the war!

564
01:11:23,529 --> 01:11:27,407
I promised myself I would do this
the first time I saw you again.

565
01:11:29,285 --> 01:11:31,536
Well, I'm sorry, brother.

566
01:11:48,721 --> 01:11:50,889
Which of you did this?

567
01:11:51,057 --> 01:11:52,057
Well...

568
01:11:52,266 --> 01:11:54,309
I'm afraid it was me.

569
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,563
- Who is she?
- My friend, Anna. She's one of us.

570
01:11:59,607 --> 01:12:01,733
It's bad that this happened to her.

571
01:12:03,194 --> 01:12:06,571
Before the Germans came, she was
a schoolteacher in Mandrakos.

572
01:12:06,781 --> 01:12:10,575
Last year, she was caught. They
tortured her to make her betray us.

573
01:12:10,827 --> 01:12:14,121
They whipped her until
the white of her bones showed.

574
01:12:15,123 --> 01:12:18,291
Some nights, we could
hear her screaming.

575
01:12:18,918 --> 01:12:22,796
Then they kept her in
the fortress for six months.

576
01:12:23,006 --> 01:12:24,798
When they let her go...

577
01:12:26,718 --> 01:12:28,093
...she could not speak.

578
01:12:28,594 --> 01:12:32,806
She has never spoken since.
Not even in her dreams.

579
01:12:33,141 --> 01:12:36,601
Even I have never been allowed
to see the scars on her back.

580
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:40,147
But she's a good fighter.
As good as any of you!

581
01:12:40,356 --> 01:12:42,274
Like a ghost, she goes anywhere!

582
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:46,028
She got us these guns.
And she kills without mercy.

583
01:12:46,946 --> 01:12:49,364
You are very lucky, brother.

584
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:00,125
No, they are the friends! Our friends!

585
01:15:08,421 --> 01:15:10,380
It's gangrene, sir.

586
01:15:11,883 --> 01:15:14,134
If the leg doesn't come off, he'll die.

587
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,635
Does he know?

588
01:15:17,388 --> 01:15:18,430
I don't think so.

589
01:15:23,436 --> 01:15:24,477
Sir...

590
01:15:26,147 --> 01:15:29,983
...I beg your pardon, but I haven't
had a chance to talk to you alone.

591
01:15:30,610 --> 01:15:34,779
I don't want to be left out anymore.
I want to be part of the team again.

592
01:15:35,990 --> 01:15:38,158
Please give me a chance.
You can trust me.

593
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:40,785
I'll think it over.

594
01:15:45,917 --> 01:15:48,835
That's gangrene! What choice
do we have now, captain?

595
01:15:49,128 --> 01:15:51,296
- Who relieved you?
- She did.

596
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:55,217
- In future, take orders only from me.
- I asked you a question, sir!

597
01:15:55,468 --> 01:15:57,302
And I heard you, corporal.

598
01:15:59,972 --> 01:16:03,308
Get yourself something to eat.
That's an order.

599
01:16:04,143 --> 01:16:05,477
Thank you, sir.

600
01:16:11,484 --> 01:16:15,237
There's a lot of activity down there.
I can hear it.

601
01:16:15,488 --> 01:16:18,323
They're turning Mandrakos
inside out.

602
01:16:19,367 --> 01:16:21,868
As soon as they move out,
we'll move in.

603
01:16:22,328 --> 01:16:24,162
We're gonna get you to a doctor.

604
01:16:24,372 --> 01:16:26,998
Brown says that you are doing well.

605
01:16:28,501 --> 01:16:31,461
Brown is a liar. And so are you.

606
01:16:32,088 --> 01:16:34,839
I haven't lost my sense of smell,
you know.

607
01:16:35,967 --> 01:16:38,760
I just hope the doctor's
a good surgeon.

608
01:16:40,513 --> 01:16:43,181
I wonder what old Jensen would say?

609
01:16:44,183 --> 01:16:46,685
My luck seems to have changed,
doesn't it?

610
01:16:47,603 --> 01:16:50,689
I don't suppose I'll ever
be a general now.

611
01:17:00,825 --> 01:17:02,284
This Franklin...

612
01:17:03,286 --> 01:17:05,203
...he's not a bad fellow.

613
01:17:05,788 --> 01:17:07,455
No, not bad at all.

614
01:17:42,241 --> 01:17:45,076
- You're sure there's a tunnel there?
- They'll never find us.

615
01:17:45,369 --> 01:17:48,496
Well, they found us here.
Let's go. Let's go!

616
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:26,344
Oh, excuse me.

617
01:19:28,264 --> 01:19:30,557
- Where is this tunnel?
- Up here, sir.

618
01:20:12,683 --> 01:20:14,058
Where does this lead to?

619
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,479
We'll come out
just behind Mandrakos.

620
01:20:18,189 --> 01:20:19,314
All right.

621
01:20:19,982 --> 01:20:21,649
Let's keep going.

622
01:20:34,205 --> 01:20:38,458
Anna?

623
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:47,258
You're limping. Are you hurt?
Do you need help?

624
01:22:30,404 --> 01:22:32,030
Thank you, old bean.

625
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,582
Get off your behinds.

626
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,718
Think there's a fire escape?

627
01:25:42,429 --> 01:25:44,138
These are fine people.

628
01:26:54,793 --> 01:26:56,460
Give up quietly, gentlemen.

629
01:26:56,670 --> 01:27:02,842
Unless you want many innocent
people killed, as well as yourselves.

630
01:27:24,489 --> 01:27:26,157
Turn around, please.

631
01:27:30,162 --> 01:27:32,997
Captain Mallory, you've made
a remarkable effort.

632
01:27:33,248 --> 01:27:36,167
Unfortunately, it was
doomed from the beginning.

633
01:27:36,627 --> 01:27:39,670
Will you tell me where you've
hidden your explosives?

634
01:27:40,505 --> 01:27:41,505
No.

635
01:27:42,007 --> 01:27:45,676
As your commanding officer, Captain
Mallory must play a heroic role.

636
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:47,887
You needn't carry such a burden.

637
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:51,766
You've all suffered a great deal.
Why prolong that suffering?

638
01:27:52,017 --> 01:27:54,018
For you, the war is over.

639
01:27:55,270 --> 01:27:59,690
Another officer is coming
to question you. A captain in the SS.

640
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:03,027
His methods, quite frankly,
are most severe.

641
01:28:03,904 --> 01:28:07,573
None of you are in uniform.
Therefore, you're considered spies.

642
01:28:07,824 --> 01:28:09,450
You know the penalty for espionage.

643
01:28:10,035 --> 01:28:14,914
But if any one of you has the courage
to tell me where the explosives are...

644
01:28:15,207 --> 01:28:18,084
...I promise, you will not only
save your own life...

645
01:28:18,293 --> 01:28:20,544
...but the lives of your comrades.

646
01:28:22,464 --> 01:28:24,548
This will be your only chance.

647
01:28:25,175 --> 01:28:27,385
I do advise you to take it.

648
01:28:27,761 --> 01:28:31,263
Please, sir! I am no spy!
I am not one of them!

649
01:28:31,473 --> 01:28:33,057
You yellow...

650
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:40,064
Go on.

651
01:28:40,273 --> 01:28:43,234
Sir, I swear to you, sir...

652
01:28:43,735 --> 01:28:46,737
...I'm just a poor fisherman.

653
01:28:46,988 --> 01:28:50,783
Two days ago these men killed
my sailors and stole my boat.

654
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,410
They forced me to join them.

655
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:55,579
Sir, I am their prisoner!

656
01:28:55,789 --> 01:28:58,457
Where did you learn
your English, fisherman?

657
01:28:58,959 --> 01:29:00,418
In Cyprus, sir.

658
01:29:00,836 --> 01:29:03,087
I swear to you, it's true.

659
01:29:03,338 --> 01:29:05,339
Aren't you Andrea Stavros?

660
01:29:05,924 --> 01:29:07,258
Colonel Stavros?

661
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:11,429
Oh, no. No, sir.
My name is Nondus Salonikus.

662
01:29:11,638 --> 01:29:14,306
I told you,
I'm a fisherman from Cyprus.

663
01:29:17,936 --> 01:29:20,354
Then how do you happen to wear
a shoulder holster?

664
01:29:23,358 --> 01:29:25,818
They forced me to wear it...

665
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:28,487
...and made it a kind ofjoke.

666
01:29:28,697 --> 01:29:30,448
Where are the explosives?

667
01:29:30,615 --> 01:29:32,491
I swear, sir...

668
01:29:33,618 --> 01:29:36,454
...I would tell you if I knew.

669
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,831
But, see, they didn't say.

670
01:29:39,541 --> 01:29:41,876
The truth is, sir, they don't trust me.

671
01:29:42,127 --> 01:29:43,961
I don't blame them.

672
01:29:56,516 --> 01:29:59,643
The commandant will telephone
to congratulate you, Muesel.

673
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:00,978
Thank you.

674
01:30:01,688 --> 01:30:05,649
I've questioned them about the
explosives, but they refuse to answer.

675
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:08,360
The Greek claims
he is not one of them.

676
01:30:09,529 --> 01:30:12,823
Now you! You are not
of this company, you say?

677
01:30:13,074 --> 01:30:14,366
No, sir, I'm not.

678
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:16,160
You are a liar!

679
01:30:19,790 --> 01:30:22,082
- But Your Excellency...
- A liar!

680
01:30:25,337 --> 01:30:27,087
Come, come. That didn't hurt.

681
01:30:28,215 --> 01:30:31,509
- Where are the explosives?
- I don't know, Your Excellency.

682
01:30:31,718 --> 01:30:34,345
Your Excellency,
I swear I do not know!

683
01:30:34,513 --> 01:30:38,265
I am not one of these men!
They forced me to join them.

684
01:30:38,475 --> 01:30:40,684
As I explained to the captain...

685
01:30:41,937 --> 01:30:43,437
...I'm just a...

686
01:30:43,647 --> 01:30:45,856
...poor fisherman from Cyprus.

687
01:30:46,775 --> 01:30:47,817
My name is...

688
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,070
...Nondus Salonikus.

689
01:30:51,321 --> 01:30:52,822
I swear to you.

690
01:30:54,866 --> 01:30:59,036
These men stole my boat and then
they forced me to join them.

691
01:30:59,246 --> 01:31:00,579
Your Excellency...

692
01:31:00,789 --> 01:31:03,582
Your Excellency, I am their prisoner!

693
01:31:29,734 --> 01:31:31,777
Where are the explosives?

694
01:31:32,070 --> 01:31:37,157
I want an answer now, or I'll personally
rearrange this officer's splints.

695
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:46,417
Very well.

696
01:31:51,673 --> 01:31:52,798
I can't!

697
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:54,466
Please, I can't!

698
01:31:54,676 --> 01:31:55,759
I can't!

699
01:32:00,932 --> 01:32:03,267
- Get up!
- I'm sick! I'm sick!

700
01:32:03,518 --> 01:32:06,770
- Get up!
- Please! Oh, I'm sick!

701
01:32:12,110 --> 01:32:13,944
But I'm sick! No, please!

702
01:32:14,154 --> 01:32:15,279
Please, I'm sick!

703
01:32:15,488 --> 01:32:17,114
I'm sick! I'm sick!

704
01:32:25,415 --> 01:32:27,207
Call the sentry in.

705
01:32:38,011 --> 01:32:39,637
Now, Oberleutnant...

706
01:32:40,513 --> 01:32:42,139
...get on the phone.

707
01:32:42,807 --> 01:32:47,019
Tell them you're not to be disturbed
until you give further orders.

708
01:32:51,900 --> 01:32:53,442
Remember...

709
01:32:54,277 --> 01:32:55,736
...I speak German...

710
01:32:56,905 --> 01:32:58,489
...perfect.

711
01:33:08,541 --> 01:33:10,334
Not very hygienic, I must say.

712
01:33:10,543 --> 01:33:12,503
Shocking taste in undies too.

713
01:33:12,671 --> 01:33:13,712
Ah, well...

714
01:33:13,964 --> 01:33:15,339
Heil, everybody!

715
01:33:34,526 --> 01:33:35,526
Roy...

716
01:33:35,902 --> 01:33:37,778
...we're gonna leave you here.

717
01:33:38,196 --> 01:33:39,613
I understand.

718
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:47,079
We're gonna let them
chase us around for a while.

719
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:50,207
But the one thing
they mustn't know...

720
01:33:51,042 --> 01:33:53,877
...is about the landing
tomorrow night.

721
01:33:54,129 --> 01:33:55,504
Of course.

722
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,258
Don't worry.

723
01:34:01,761 --> 01:34:03,053
Oh, thanks.

724
01:34:06,141 --> 01:34:07,307
Good luck.

725
01:34:11,771 --> 01:34:12,896
Hold it.

726
01:34:15,316 --> 01:34:17,276
We'll leave Major Franklin behind.

727
01:34:20,113 --> 01:34:21,655
He's a wounded officer.

728
01:34:22,615 --> 01:34:25,451
I expect him to get medical attention.

729
01:34:25,910 --> 01:34:28,787
We don't make war on wounded men.

730
01:34:30,540 --> 01:34:33,167
We're not all like Hauptmann Sessler.

731
01:34:35,920 --> 01:34:38,422
Now, where's the camp radio station?

732
01:34:38,673 --> 01:34:40,466
I will not tell you.

733
01:34:44,846 --> 01:34:48,182
You wouldn't hesitate to kill me
for any number of reasons.

734
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:50,476
But not this one.

735
01:34:51,186 --> 01:34:53,604
In any event, I will not tell you.

736
01:35:09,120 --> 01:35:12,164
- So long, Roy.
- Good luck, Keith.

737
01:35:16,336 --> 01:35:18,128
Well, Lucky, I shall miss you.

738
01:35:21,633 --> 01:35:23,967
Try to be a bad patient, will you?

739
01:35:24,177 --> 01:35:27,179
Keep on asking for bedpans.
Drives them mad.

740
01:35:28,139 --> 01:35:29,473
I'll keep it in mind.

741
01:35:33,478 --> 01:35:35,729
When this is over,
you'll buy me a lunch.

742
01:35:35,980 --> 01:35:39,108
Roast beef, Yorkshire pudding,
a nice little red wine...

743
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:41,401
Steak and kidney pie.

744
01:35:41,820 --> 01:35:44,321
Anything you say.
You'll be paying for it.

745
01:35:50,453 --> 01:35:53,247
And you, colonel,
what a performance.

746
01:35:54,999 --> 01:35:56,375
All right.

747
01:36:53,391 --> 01:36:56,894
I hope you were right to leave
Franklin with the Germans.

748
01:37:36,267 --> 01:37:37,267
Sir?

749
01:37:37,602 --> 01:37:41,021
- Yes?
- No, not you, sir. Mr. Stavros.

750
01:37:43,024 --> 01:37:45,025
Tell me about yourself.

751
01:37:45,652 --> 01:37:47,819
- What do you want to know?
- Are you married?

752
01:37:48,863 --> 01:37:50,489
I have been married.

753
01:37:51,950 --> 01:37:54,451
My wife and children were killed.

754
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:02,542
Have you killed many people?

755
01:38:03,628 --> 01:38:05,128
Only Germans.

756
01:38:05,338 --> 01:38:06,838
Oh, some Italians too.

757
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,883
- Captain Mallory?
- Yes?

758
01:38:10,468 --> 01:38:12,302
You are a lucky man.

759
01:38:12,512 --> 01:38:13,553
Yes, I know.

760
01:38:15,807 --> 01:38:17,683
- Mr. Stavros?
- Yes?

761
01:38:18,643 --> 01:38:19,810
I like you.

762
01:38:23,731 --> 01:38:25,399
I like you too.

763
01:39:23,708 --> 01:39:24,958
I don't know.

764
01:39:25,626 --> 01:39:28,462
Well, baby face,
I never would have known you.

765
01:39:28,963 --> 01:39:31,214
You better get rid of that
fuzz under your nose.

766
01:39:31,466 --> 01:39:33,383
No, I'm an officer, remember?

767
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,886
You just picked the wrong uniform.

768
01:39:40,433 --> 01:39:44,353
Lights out in five minutes.
I want you as well-rested as possible.

769
01:39:44,604 --> 01:39:46,605
Now, first thing in the morning...

770
01:39:47,440 --> 01:39:50,776
...we'll ditch the truck
and get hold of another car.

771
01:39:51,069 --> 01:39:54,613
Then we'll pick up the explosives
and go into Navarone.

772
01:39:54,864 --> 01:39:58,408
We've got to be inside the fortress
by 10:00 tomorrow night.

773
01:39:58,993 --> 01:40:00,327
Might one inquire how?

774
01:40:01,287 --> 01:40:02,579
We're gonna walk in.

775
01:40:03,289 --> 01:40:05,290
Simply because of this masquerade?

776
01:40:05,458 --> 01:40:06,500
No.

777
01:40:10,463 --> 01:40:13,757
Because I told Franklin
our orders had been changed.

778
01:40:15,176 --> 01:40:16,885
That we weren't after the guns.

779
01:40:17,095 --> 01:40:20,430
That we were just to create
a diversion for an assault...

780
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,392
...tomorrow night
on the Turkish side.

781
01:40:23,601 --> 01:40:27,604
Now, if my hunch is right, the Germans
will give him scopolamine...

782
01:40:27,772 --> 01:40:31,108
...and that's what he'll tell them.

783
01:40:31,692 --> 01:40:35,612
They may not believe it, but they'll
be faced with the fact that he does.

784
01:40:37,782 --> 01:40:41,284
Now I'm gambling that
they'll clear out of Navarone...

785
01:40:41,452 --> 01:40:44,037
...and take up positions on the coast.

786
01:40:44,247 --> 01:40:45,288
Very clever.

787
01:40:48,626 --> 01:40:52,671
But that still leaves the garrison
inside the fortress...

788
01:40:53,005 --> 01:40:57,008
...and we get them out by having
Andrea, Pappadimos and Brown...

789
01:40:57,510 --> 01:41:01,054
...start up diversions
all over Navarone.

790
01:41:01,597 --> 01:41:04,015
If there's enough confusion going...

791
01:41:04,475 --> 01:41:07,352
...Miller and I should have
a chance to break in.

792
01:41:07,645 --> 01:41:12,315
At the same time, the girls will steal
the fastest boat they can find...

793
01:41:12,483 --> 01:41:16,862
...so we all have a chance of
getting out when this thing is over.

794
01:41:17,196 --> 01:41:19,156
Very clever, indeed.

795
01:41:19,991 --> 01:41:24,661
Suppose they don't have any
scopolamine? What happens then?

796
01:41:26,038 --> 01:41:28,999
Suppose they use the
old-fashioned methods?

797
01:41:29,500 --> 01:41:32,669
Suppose your ventriloquist's dummy
just won't talk...

798
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:36,006
...because he's a good man?
He won't be easy to break!

799
01:41:36,841 --> 01:41:40,010
He may take a lot of punishment
before he tells them our plan!

800
01:41:40,511 --> 01:41:43,722
He may even die on them
and tell them nothing at all!

801
01:41:44,015 --> 01:41:45,432
Have you considered that?

802
01:41:48,352 --> 01:41:49,394
Yes, I have.

803
01:41:49,854 --> 01:41:51,688
I'll bet you have!

804
01:41:54,525 --> 01:41:57,360
I'll bet you've considered that
as far back as the cliff!

805
01:41:57,570 --> 01:41:58,778
You and your...

806
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:01,072
...three choices.

807
01:42:02,533 --> 01:42:07,287
I'll bet that's why you dragged him
around with us all this time!

808
01:42:08,039 --> 01:42:10,207
If he lives,
he'll never be the same again!

809
01:42:10,791 --> 01:42:13,418
Do you know what you've done?

810
01:42:14,212 --> 01:42:17,255
You've used up
an important human being!

811
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:23,053
Oh, I misjudged you.

812
01:42:23,554 --> 01:42:27,224
You're rather a ruthless character,
Captain Mallory.

813
01:42:29,227 --> 01:42:31,436
I didn't think of it back on the cliff.

814
01:42:32,063 --> 01:42:33,522
But if I had...

815
01:42:34,732 --> 01:42:38,401
...I'd have done the same thing.
It's our only chance!

816
01:42:38,569 --> 01:42:41,238
Well, right now I say
to hell with the job!

817
01:42:41,447 --> 01:42:44,741
I've been on 100 jobs,
none of which altered the war.

818
01:42:44,909 --> 01:42:49,287
There've been 1000 wars and there'll
be 1000 more, until we're all dead.

819
01:42:49,539 --> 01:42:52,082
I don't care about the war anymore.
I care about Roy!

820
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,167
And if Turkey enters
on the wrong side?

821
01:42:54,377 --> 01:42:58,588
So what? Let the world blow itself
to pieces, as it deserves!

822
01:42:58,756 --> 01:43:01,174
What about the 2000 men on Kheros?

823
01:43:01,384 --> 01:43:04,511
I don't know them.
But I do know the man on Navarone!

824
01:43:04,971 --> 01:43:09,015
Mr. Miller, the man was
finished when he fell.

825
01:43:09,225 --> 01:43:12,602
That's easy for you to say,
sitting there, drinking coffee!

826
01:43:26,117 --> 01:43:29,578
It's funny. I was grateful
when you left him behind today.

827
01:43:30,955 --> 01:43:32,872
I just hope before this job's over...

828
01:43:33,124 --> 01:43:36,793
...that I get the chance to use you
the way you've used him.

829
01:43:40,590 --> 01:43:43,466
I'm sorry, but I couldn't think
of any other way.

830
01:43:47,305 --> 01:43:49,598
Everybody get a good night's sleep.

831
01:43:50,641 --> 01:43:52,892
No matter how it goes tomorrow...

832
01:43:53,352 --> 01:43:54,978
...you're gonna need it.

833
01:43:57,148 --> 01:43:59,357
I'll take the first watch.

834
01:45:09,095 --> 01:45:10,261
Hello.

835
01:45:30,574 --> 01:45:32,200
Tell me, schoolteacher...

836
01:45:32,702 --> 01:45:35,245
...from a purely moral point of view...

837
01:45:36,997 --> 01:45:40,917
...bearing in mind that we represent
goodness and civilization...

838
01:45:41,919 --> 01:45:45,839
...do you think that what I did
was a civilized thing to do?

839
01:47:07,087 --> 01:47:09,047
Scopolamine.

840
01:48:50,691 --> 01:48:52,775
They are burning Mandrakos...

841
01:48:52,943 --> 01:48:54,444
...in punishment.

842
01:51:11,915 --> 01:51:13,958
This part of town
has been evacuated...

843
01:51:14,251 --> 01:51:17,295
...because the guns' vibrations
has weakened the houses.

844
01:52:12,142 --> 01:52:14,685
Where will the attacks come?

845
01:52:14,978 --> 01:52:17,814
On the Turkish side.

846
01:52:18,107 --> 01:52:21,317
What time?

847
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:53,224
Is the timetable clear?
Any questions?

848
01:52:55,018 --> 01:52:56,060
Good luck.

849
01:53:11,201 --> 01:53:13,452
I won't be needing this. You take it.

850
01:53:15,080 --> 01:53:16,164
Spyro.

851
01:53:17,791 --> 01:53:19,041
Andrea.

852
01:53:27,301 --> 01:53:29,260
Everybody stay where you are.

853
01:53:29,469 --> 01:53:31,387
The party's over.

854
01:53:31,889 --> 01:53:34,056
Somebody's stepped on the cake.

855
01:53:35,309 --> 01:53:38,269
Exhibit A: A clockwork fuse.

856
01:53:38,562 --> 01:53:41,230
Elementary and archaic,
but they work.

857
01:53:41,398 --> 01:53:43,482
This one won't work anymore.
Know why?

858
01:53:43,734 --> 01:53:46,819
The clock's okay,
but the contact arm's broken off.

859
01:53:47,070 --> 01:53:50,781
It could tick until Christmas
and not even set off a firecracker!

860
01:53:53,243 --> 01:53:56,412
Exhibit B:
Exhibit B is missing.

861
01:53:56,705 --> 01:54:00,791
All my slow burning fuses are gone.
Disappeared! Vanished!

862
01:54:01,293 --> 01:54:04,128
Exhibit C: My time pencils.

863
01:54:05,130 --> 01:54:07,924
75 grains of fulminate of mercury
in each of them.

864
01:54:08,217 --> 01:54:13,304
Enough to blow my hand off.
And very unstable, very delicate.

865
01:54:23,232 --> 01:54:25,608
Which means there's
a traitor in this room.

866
01:54:26,318 --> 01:54:28,277
You're crazy.
It happened at base.

867
01:54:28,445 --> 01:54:32,114
No, I'm not that crazy!
I checked it all before I left base.

868
01:54:32,991 --> 01:54:34,659
No, here.

869
01:54:35,035 --> 01:54:36,285
Here!

870
01:54:36,536 --> 01:54:38,287
Someone here.

871
01:54:41,792 --> 01:54:43,000
But who?

872
01:54:43,794 --> 01:54:44,835
Who?

873
01:54:45,128 --> 01:54:48,047
This stuff's only been
out of my sight two times.

874
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:52,510
Once was when Andrea and Maria
took it away to hide it.

875
01:54:54,805 --> 01:54:57,390
But it was all right
when we picked it up again.

876
01:54:57,641 --> 01:55:00,476
The only other time was
when we left it in the truck...

877
01:55:00,644 --> 01:55:02,019
...and we scouted the gates.

878
01:55:02,312 --> 01:55:03,479
All of us!

879
01:55:07,192 --> 01:55:08,985
Except her.

880
01:55:09,987 --> 01:55:12,029
We left her on guard in the truck...

881
01:55:12,322 --> 01:55:13,531
...alone.

882
01:55:14,074 --> 01:55:15,324
You are crazy, sir!

883
01:55:16,368 --> 01:55:18,661
Let me just think for a moment.

884
01:55:24,293 --> 01:55:27,837
Since we got here, we've jumped
out of one frying pan into another.

885
01:55:28,005 --> 01:55:29,088
Just think...

886
01:55:30,007 --> 01:55:32,341
We were hiding in the carob grove...

887
01:55:32,676 --> 01:55:35,511
...and she's up in a tree. Remember?

888
01:55:35,721 --> 01:55:38,723
Anybody can signal an airplane
with tin or a mirror.

889
01:55:39,016 --> 01:55:41,100
And they found us there,
didn't they?

890
01:55:42,561 --> 01:55:44,020
And then in the tunnel.

891
01:55:44,313 --> 01:55:47,606
In the tunnel she lagged far behind,
with a shocking limp.

892
01:55:47,858 --> 01:55:49,358
Seen her limping lately?

893
01:55:49,735 --> 01:55:52,737
But being behind us,
she could leave some messages.

894
01:55:53,322 --> 01:55:57,325
So when you take Roy to the doctor,
the Germans are waiting for you.

895
01:55:57,534 --> 01:56:00,119
When she takes us to her place,
they come there.

896
01:56:00,329 --> 01:56:01,537
But she got us out.

897
01:56:01,747 --> 01:56:05,708
Of course! That house would be a
shambles and she'd be dead with us.

898
01:56:05,876 --> 01:56:08,044
So, what does she do?

899
01:56:08,545 --> 01:56:12,214
She disappears into the bedroom
to change her clothes...

900
01:56:12,466 --> 01:56:14,717
...and to leave a little note.

901
01:56:15,218 --> 01:56:17,845
She takes us to the wedding
and we're caught...

902
01:56:18,055 --> 01:56:20,056
...because we can't get to our guns!

903
01:56:20,265 --> 01:56:23,225
But even if we can, we slaughter
half of Mandrakos!

904
01:56:23,435 --> 01:56:25,936
You are an insane man!

905
01:56:26,772 --> 01:56:28,105
Am I?

906
01:56:28,899 --> 01:56:30,566
Maybe I am.

907
01:56:30,942 --> 01:56:32,651
Nothing surprises me anymore.

908
01:56:40,577 --> 01:56:43,079
We can settle this thing very easily.

909
01:56:43,372 --> 01:56:46,082
Let's see those scars
the Germans made on her back...

910
01:56:46,666 --> 01:56:48,167
...those terrible scars.

911
01:56:50,587 --> 01:56:52,421
How about it, Maria?

912
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:55,091
Don't you want to see those scars?

913
01:57:23,954 --> 01:57:25,413
Q.E.D.

914
01:57:43,974 --> 01:57:46,016
You cannot believe it?

915
01:57:48,145 --> 01:57:49,353
Believe it.

916
01:57:50,647 --> 01:57:52,648
I cannot stand pain.

917
01:57:54,985 --> 01:57:58,654
It's easy to be brave when you're free,
when you're with friends.

918
01:57:59,197 --> 01:58:00,739
But I was caught.

919
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:05,202
The others were free but they didn't
help me. I was alone.

920
01:58:06,830 --> 01:58:08,831
I was alone in their hands.

921
01:58:10,333 --> 01:58:13,544
They said they would put me
into their brothels.

922
01:58:13,962 --> 01:58:16,046
They said they would torture me.

923
01:58:19,551 --> 01:58:22,219
I saw what they did to other people.

924
01:58:29,853 --> 01:58:32,521
I'm sorry.
I cannot stand pain.

925
01:58:38,111 --> 01:58:39,695
When we got here...

926
01:58:42,741 --> 01:58:44,867
...why didn't you put in with us?

927
01:58:47,871 --> 01:58:50,289
You could have come with us!

928
01:58:52,083 --> 01:58:54,502
It was your only chance
to get free of them!

929
01:58:54,711 --> 01:58:56,795
There was never any chance.

930
01:58:57,547 --> 01:58:59,215
You never had any chance!

931
01:58:59,799 --> 01:59:02,259
It was hopeless from the beginning.

932
01:59:02,802 --> 01:59:04,929
You'll never get out of here!
Never!

933
01:59:07,015 --> 01:59:09,141
I tried to tell you last night.

934
01:59:25,575 --> 01:59:27,451
Can you do anything at all?

935
01:59:27,827 --> 01:59:29,036
I don't know.

936
01:59:32,457 --> 01:59:35,084
There's always some way
to blow up explosives.

937
01:59:35,293 --> 01:59:38,045
The trick is not to be around
when they go off.

938
01:59:39,756 --> 01:59:42,258
But aren't you forgetting
something, captain?

939
01:59:42,634 --> 01:59:43,968
The lady.

940
01:59:44,844 --> 01:59:47,096
As I see it,
we have three choices:

941
01:59:47,347 --> 01:59:50,307
One, we can leave her here.
But she might be found.

942
01:59:50,600 --> 01:59:53,686
And in her case
they won't need a truth drug.

943
01:59:53,937 --> 01:59:57,356
Two, we take her with us.
But that makes things more difficult.

944
01:59:57,941 --> 01:59:59,483
And three...

945
02:00:00,318 --> 02:00:02,987
Well, that's Andrea's choice.
Remember?

946
02:00:06,783 --> 02:00:08,659
You really want
your pound of flesh.

947
02:00:08,827 --> 02:00:09,868
Yes.

948
02:00:10,120 --> 02:00:11,954
Yes, I do.

949
02:00:12,872 --> 02:00:16,000
I just couldn't manage to get
to sleep last night.

950
02:00:16,376 --> 02:00:20,588
- If you're anxious to kill her, do it!
- I'm not anxious to kill her.

951
02:00:20,797 --> 02:00:22,840
I'm not anxious to kill anyone.

952
02:00:23,133 --> 02:00:27,011
See, I'm not a born soldier.
I got trapped.

953
02:00:28,096 --> 02:00:29,805
You may find me facetious...

954
02:00:29,973 --> 02:00:34,643
...but if I didn't make some bad jokes,
I'd go out of my mind.

955
02:00:35,020 --> 02:00:37,646
No, I prefer
to leave the killing to you.

956
02:00:37,814 --> 02:00:40,858
An officer and a gentleman.
A leader of men, a hero.

957
02:00:41,901 --> 02:00:45,195
If you think I enjoy this, you're mad!
I never wanted it.

958
02:00:45,488 --> 02:00:47,990
I was trapped like you,
or anybody in uniform.

959
02:00:48,241 --> 02:00:50,492
You wanted it.
You're an officer, aren't you?

960
02:00:50,744 --> 02:00:54,038
I'll never want the responsibility
of an officer.

961
02:00:54,331 --> 02:00:57,207
Then you've had a free ride
all this time.

962
02:00:57,667 --> 02:01:02,046
Someone's got to be responsible.
Do you think it's easy?

963
02:01:02,255 --> 02:01:03,839
I don't know!

964
02:01:05,508 --> 02:01:09,219
I'm beginning to wonder who is
responsible to do the dirty work.

965
02:01:09,429 --> 02:01:13,098
Is the man who gives the orders guilty,
or the one who has to do it?

966
02:01:13,308 --> 02:01:16,226
- We've no time for this.
- Now just a minute!

967
02:01:16,686 --> 02:01:20,648
If we're gonna get this job done,
she has got to be killed!

968
02:01:21,024 --> 02:01:24,777
And we all know how keen you are
on getting the job done.

969
02:01:25,070 --> 02:01:28,197
I've never killed a woman before,
traitor or not...

970
02:01:28,406 --> 02:01:30,074
...and I'm finicky.

971
02:01:30,533 --> 02:01:35,037
So why don't you do it?
Why don't you let us off for once?

972
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:38,374
Come on, be a pal.
Be a father to your men.

973
02:01:38,667 --> 02:01:43,379
Come down off your cross,
close your eyes and pull the trigger!

974
02:01:43,588 --> 02:01:44,922
What do you say, sir?

975
02:03:08,506 --> 02:03:11,341
You all know what you
have to do. Get started.

976
02:03:12,177 --> 02:03:14,636
Brown, you go with Maria.

977
02:03:45,335 --> 02:03:48,879
Now, you know when you put on
a uniform and learn how to do it...

978
02:03:49,088 --> 02:03:51,340
...it's not hard to kill anyone.

979
02:03:51,508 --> 02:03:53,342
Sometimes it's harder not to.

980
02:03:54,677 --> 02:03:58,680
You think you've been getting away
with it all this time, standing by.

981
02:03:58,890 --> 02:04:00,098
Well, son...

982
02:04:01,309 --> 02:04:03,519
...your "bystanding" days are over.

983
02:04:03,812 --> 02:04:06,563
You're in it now, up to your neck!

984
02:04:07,440 --> 02:04:10,859
They say you're a genius with
explosives. Start proving it!

985
02:04:11,069 --> 02:04:13,529
You got me in the mood
to use this thing...

986
02:04:13,696 --> 02:04:17,699
...and by God, if you don't think
of something, I'll use it on you!

987
02:04:18,201 --> 02:04:19,409
I mean it.

988
02:04:20,870 --> 02:04:22,204
Go on.

989
02:10:13,306 --> 02:10:16,725
You stay here.
I'll call you if I need you.

990
02:10:16,934 --> 02:10:18,143
Whatever you say, sir.

991
02:16:53,664 --> 02:16:58,126
Spyro!

992
02:17:34,872 --> 02:17:36,706
Detonators, sir, please.

993
02:17:41,420 --> 02:17:43,880
I'll be finished here in about
30 seconds.

994
02:18:30,886 --> 02:18:31,969
Miller?

995
02:18:36,475 --> 02:18:37,600
Miller!

996
02:18:48,821 --> 02:18:51,239
- Miller!
- Yes, what is it?

997
02:19:01,083 --> 02:19:02,500
What are you doing?

998
02:19:02,710 --> 02:19:05,753
They'll search those guns first
and find my stuff.

999
02:19:06,004 --> 02:19:07,630
They're not stupid.

1000
02:19:07,923 --> 02:19:12,260
But if they remove it carelessly,
they could have the same result.

1001
02:19:12,469 --> 02:19:15,263
But I'm banking on this job
being our insurance.

1002
02:19:15,764 --> 02:19:19,100
- What happens?
- Would you bring down the hoist?

1003
02:19:29,361 --> 02:19:30,611
Whoa, that's enough!

1004
02:19:30,821 --> 02:19:32,530
See this bottom runner?

1005
02:19:32,781 --> 02:19:36,743
When they send this hoist down for
shells or charges, it'll come here.

1006
02:19:36,952 --> 02:19:40,288
It'll hit these
two wires and we get a circuit...

1007
02:19:40,456 --> 02:19:43,458
...that'll send up
all my plastic explosives here...

1008
02:19:43,667 --> 02:19:46,794
...plus this little item...

1009
02:19:48,046 --> 02:19:49,547
...that I borrowed here.

1010
02:19:51,258 --> 02:19:53,968
They won't see these wires
under the grease.

1011
02:19:54,511 --> 02:19:56,304
Are you sure it'll work?

1012
02:19:56,638 --> 02:19:59,474
No guarantee, but the theory's
perfectly feasible.

1013
02:19:59,767 --> 02:20:01,768
But if this stuff goes up...

1014
02:20:01,977 --> 02:20:05,021
...everything else in this place
will go up with it.

1015
02:20:05,230 --> 02:20:07,815
Suppose you don't get a contact?

1016
02:20:08,650 --> 02:20:12,403
Then I'll be responsible for sinking
one of the destroyers...

1017
02:20:12,654 --> 02:20:14,655
...maybe the whole lot of them.

1018
02:20:15,282 --> 02:20:19,035
I'm sorry, sir. It's the only way
I know to get the job done.

1019
02:20:19,495 --> 02:20:21,329
As you said, I'm in it now...

1020
02:20:21,580 --> 02:20:23,080
...up to my neck.

1021
02:20:30,839 --> 02:20:32,173
Hurry up.

1022
02:21:06,542 --> 02:21:07,917
- Go ahead.
- After you.

1023
02:21:08,126 --> 02:21:10,086
Remember? I can't swim.

1024
02:21:11,213 --> 02:21:13,214
You won't let me drown, will you?

1025
02:24:02,217 --> 02:24:03,259
I can't make it.

1026
02:24:03,719 --> 02:24:05,052
My arm...

1027
02:24:13,061 --> 02:24:14,729
Come on, man. Take it!

1028
02:24:16,648 --> 02:24:17,982
Grab it!

1029
02:27:11,907 --> 02:27:14,241
Spyro's dead, isn't he?

1030
02:27:15,952 --> 02:27:17,411
What happened?

1031
02:27:20,290 --> 02:27:22,249
He forgot why we came here.

1032
02:32:52,830 --> 02:32:55,582
And now you're going back to Crete?

1033
02:32:56,417 --> 02:32:57,793
Yes.

1034
02:33:00,338 --> 02:33:01,630
Come with us.

1035
02:33:02,674 --> 02:33:03,924
With us?

1036
02:33:05,260 --> 02:33:06,260
With me.

1037
02:33:06,553 --> 02:33:08,095
I must go back.

1038
02:33:08,680 --> 02:33:11,431
You saw what the Germans did
to Mandrakos.

1039
02:33:11,683 --> 02:33:15,811
Navarone will pay heavily for
your success tonight.

1040
02:33:22,944 --> 02:33:24,820
Come on,
I'll give you a hand.

1041
02:33:25,071 --> 02:33:26,113
I'm going back.

1042
02:33:27,991 --> 02:33:30,117
The job is finished.

1043
02:33:30,285 --> 02:33:31,618
Your job is finished.

1044
02:33:32,328 --> 02:33:36,081
What chance do you think you have
of staying alive back there?

1045
02:33:38,126 --> 02:33:40,043
I'm not so easy to kill.

1046
02:33:45,049 --> 02:33:46,383
Hey.

1047
02:34:20,335 --> 02:34:23,378
Well, the boys on Kheros
will be happy soon.

1048
02:34:25,340 --> 02:34:28,425
It'll be crowded, but
there's nothing like an ocean voyage:

1049
02:34:28,676 --> 02:34:32,179
Fresh air, good food,
deck sports, pretty girls...

1050
02:34:39,687 --> 02:34:42,022
I'd like to offer you
my apologies...

1051
02:34:42,231 --> 02:34:44,024
...and my congratulations.

1052
02:34:53,201 --> 02:34:55,535
The truth is,
I didn't think we could do it.

1053
02:34:55,787 --> 02:34:58,413
To tell you the truth,
neither did I.
