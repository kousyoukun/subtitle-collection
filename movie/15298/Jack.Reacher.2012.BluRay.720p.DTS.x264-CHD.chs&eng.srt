上
Move!

14
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,540
现在可是生死抉择  詹姆斯
It's life or death now, James.

15
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,920
也就是说  在洛克维尔监狱里
By that, I mean you're doing one or the other

16
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:31,260
你只能选择生或者死
up in Rockview.

17
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,630
这是地方检察官  罗丁
This here is District Attorney Rodin.

18
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,100
你想知道他在想什么吗
Want to know what he's wondering?

19
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,560
他在想你是会像男子汉一样走进死囚监狱
Whether you're gonna walk like a man or cry like a pussy

20
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,430
还是会像娘们儿一样哭哭啼啼
on your way to the death house.

21
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,940
地方检察官喜欢直接宣判死刑
See, the D.A. likes the needle,

22
00:08:46,270 --> 00:08:47,980
而我
whereas me,

23
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,940
希望你这样的人能长命百岁
I like to see a man like you live a long life

24
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,940
可以慢慢折磨你
with all your teeth knocked out.

25
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:57,110
把你折磨得半死不活
Passed around till a brother can't tell your fart from a yawn.

26
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,370
虽然我不知道你是什么样的人
Now, I don't know what kind of man you are,

27
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:01,240
也不知道你更喜欢哪种命运
which of these two fates you prefer,

28
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:03,550
但罗丁是个仁慈的人
but Rodin here is a generous fellow.

29
00:09:03,550 --> 00:09:05,960
他同意让你自己选
He's willing to let you take your pick.

30
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:11,300
如果你不想耗时费力
If you save us and this city a long and costly trial,

31
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,670
那就放弃请律师直接认罪吧
waive your right to counsel and confess, right now.

32
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:28,400
16个小时
Sixteen hours.

33
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,980
刷新纪录了吧  探长
Has to be some kind of record, Detective.

34
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,660
你写的是什么
What the hell is this?

35
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,670
杰克・雷彻又是谁
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

36
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,000
杰克・雷彻
Jack Reacher,

37
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:58,510
就叫杰克  没有中间名  就像个幽灵
born Jack, not John, no middle name, is a ghost.

38
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:01,180
没有驾照  不论是过去还是现在
No driver's licence, current or expired.

39
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,060
一直都没有住址
No residence, current or former.

40
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,960
没有信用卡  也没有信用纪录
No credit cards, no credit history.

41
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:08,350
没有邮箱  不用手机  不发电子邮件
No P.O. Box, cell phone, e-mail.

42
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,980
没有任何记录
Nothing.

43
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,560
你至少告诉我他是谁吧
Can you at least tell me who he is?

44
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:14,820
我可以告诉你他原来是干什么的  军人世家
Well, I can tell you who he was. Blood military.

45
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:17,070
在海外的军事基地出生长大
Born and raised on bases abroad.

46
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:20,200
母亲是法国人  父亲是军人
Mother was a French national, father in the Corps.

47
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:23,370
第一次来美国是去西点军校上学
His first trip to the United States was to attend West Point.

48
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:25,700
四年后出境执行任务
Four years later, he ships out for good.

49
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,710
去过伊拉克  阿富汗  巴尔干等地
Iraq. Afghanistan. The Balkans. You name it.

50
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,210
获得了很多荣誉
Served with distinction.

51
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:35,550
银星勋章  铜星勋章  战功勋章
Silver Star, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit.

52
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:40,430
国防高级服务勋章  这个没听说过
Defence Superior Service Medal? Had to look that one up.

53
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,050
还有一枚紫心勋章  他主要在宪兵队工作
And a Purple Heart. He spent the bulk of his service

54
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,730
总而言之
in the Military Police. By all accounts,

55
00:10:45,730 --> 00:10:47,270
他是一名出色的调查员
a brilliant investigator.

56
00:10:47,770 --> 00:10:49,890
当然  也很爱惹是生非
Apparently, a troublemaker, too.

57
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:51,560
他被降职为上尉
Demoted to Captain.

58
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,230
后来又一路升回少校
Worked his way back to Major.

59
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:56,730
两年前  从部队退役
Then two years ago, he musters out.

60
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,920
他几乎一辈子都混在军队
After a literal lifetime in the military,

61
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:02,070
却突然退伍了
he just up and quits. And then,

62
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,200
之后生平第二次
for only the second time in his life,

63
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:07,790
他来到美国  从此就销声匿迹了
he enters the United States and simply disappears.

64
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:09,960
是不是死了
Dead, maybe?

65
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:10,860
根据社保记录
Not according to Social Security

66
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:13,580
和弗吉尼亚州一家银行的记录来看  应该没有
and a bank account in Virginia.

67
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:15,960
每月他的抚恤金发放后
His pension is deposited monthly

68
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,550
都会有人不定期地支取
and someone is making the

69
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:20,010
都是通过电汇方式
occasional withdrawal. All wire transfers.

70
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,930
我的权限只能查到这么多
I can't find out where without a federal warrant.

71
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,470
那他不能开车也不能乘坐飞机
Well, he can't drive or fly.

72
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,060
至少不是用自己的身份
At least not under his real name.

73
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,770
-有没有什么犯罪记录  -没有
-Any warrants? -Record's clean.

74
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,310
不可能  这样神秘难寻的人  肯定犯过什么事
Come on! A guy this hard to find? Gotta be wanted for something.

75
00:11:35,610 --> 00:11:36,940
他没有任何犯罪记录
His record is clean.

76
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,980
这样的话
So,

77
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:44,620
我们怎么才能找到这个雷彻呢
how do we find this Reacher?

78
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,290
很明显我们找不到他  除非他自己现身
Obviously, you don't find this guy unless he wants to be found.

79
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,620
打扰一下  有位叫杰克・雷彻的人想见你
Excuse me, sir. There's a Jack Reacher here to see you.

80
00:12:01,970 --> 00:12:03,130
有什么事吗
Can I help you?

81
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,680
我找詹姆斯・巴尔
James Barr.

82
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:15,810
现在你看到他了  你怎么认识他的
So, now you've seen him. How do you know him?

83
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,360
为什么他没有受到保护性监禁
Why wasn't he in protective custody?

84
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,610
那是个小疏忽
That was an oversight.

85
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:24,030
更像是那些势利小人把他送入虎口的
More like some Corrections flunky threw him to the wolves.

86
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:25,990
可能是吧
Just as likely.

87
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,160
但是事情已经发生  我们也无法挽回了
But it's done and we can't undo it.

88
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,450
那现在怎么办
So what happens now?

89
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,830
他还在昏迷中
Well, now he's in a coma.

90
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:34,520
他醒来以后我们会再审问他
We'll try him when he wakes up.

91
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,670
如果他能醒来的话
If he wakes up.

92
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,460
好吧  该你说了雷彻
Okay? Now it's your turn, Reacher.

93
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,840
他为什么要你做证人
Why did he call you as a witness?

94
00:12:40,170 --> 00:12:41,510
我认为他不会
I don't believe he did.

95
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,220
但是他指名要你
Well, I believe he asked for you by name.

96
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:45,840
我能不能看下证物
Any chance I could look at the evidence?

97
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,640
不行  除非你先回答我几个问题
No way. Not till you answer some questions.

98
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:48,970
再会
Nice meeting you.

99
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,390
雷彻先生
Mr Reacher.

100
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,020
-雷彻先生  -等一下  站住
-Mr Reacher! -Hey, stop! Stop right there!

101
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,480
我们说好了的
We had a deal.

102
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:55,810
我带你来看巴尔  你告诉我你知道的信息
I take you to Barr, you tell me what you know.

103
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:58,650
我知道你说他杀了五个人  现在昏迷中
I know you say he shot five people, I know he's in a coma.

104
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,860
我还知道三英里外就有个汽车站
I know there's a bus station three miles away

105
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,780
我用24分钟就能走到
and I can walk there in 24 minutes.

106
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,190
你就这么撇下你朋友走了
So you're just going to walk out on your friend?

107
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,990
-他不是我朋友  -那他为什么找你来
-He's not my friend. -Why'd he ask for you, then?

108
00:13:06,070 --> 00:13:09,030
和他枪杀五个人是同样的原因  他疯了
Well, same reason he shot five people, he's crazy.

109
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,200
等一下
Hey. Hold on.

110
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:11,540
放手
Don't do that.

111
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:14,540
你们俩真是卑鄙啊
Well, this is a new low, even for both of you.

112
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:16,330
我不在你们不能审问我的当事人
You do not talk to my client without me present.

113
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,460
你应该知道
You know that.

114
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:19,080
我们没审问你的当事人
We weren't talking to your client.

115
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:20,670
他还在昏迷中  拜托
He's in a coma, for Christ's sakes.

116
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:21,840
你是巴尔的辩护律师  
You're Barr's attorney?

117
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,260
这是海伦・罗丁  这是杰克・雷彻
Helen Rodin, Jack Reacher.

118
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:25,220
-杰克・雷彻  -海伦・罗丁
-Jack Reacher? -Helen Rodin.

119
00:13:25,380 --> 00:13:26,930
对  她是地方检察官的女儿
Yeah, she's the District Attorney's daughter.

120
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:28,050
这事说来话长
It's a good story, actually.

121
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,220
愿闻其详
I'd like to hear it.

122
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,470
你们怎么找到他的  他们怎么找到你的
How'd you find him? How'd they find you?

123
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,060
你们不能和他接触  一天就犯了两次规
You can't be talking to this man. Two strikes in one day.

124
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,890
-事实不是这样的  -是他找的我们
-It's not what it looks like. -He came to us.

125
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,770
-你去了地方检察官办公室  -这犯法吗
-You went to the D. A? -Is there a law against that?

126
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,360
目前不犯法
None you're currently breaking.

127
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,480
算了吧  别弄得这么尴尬
Come on, before this gets awkward. Now, hey.

128
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,900
快说句法庭见  拜托
Say, "See you in court." For me.

129
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,570
再见  探长
Goodbye, Detective.

130
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,570
-很高兴见到你  -我也是
-Weird meeting you. -Likewise.

131
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:49,950
走吧
Let's go.

132
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,080
那么
So...

133
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,580
那么  你就是杰克・雷彻
So, you're Jack Reacher.

134
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,380
-那么你是地方检察官的女儿  -天啊  拜托
-So you're the D.A.'s daughter. -Oh, Jesus. Please.

135
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,300
-这合法吗  -幸运的是  合法
-Is that even legal? -Fortunately.

136
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:05,710
-怎么会这样  -出庭作证我就告诉你
-How does that happen? -I'll tell you after deposition.

137
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,880
你不会想要我出庭作证的
You don't want to depose me.

138
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,130
没办法  你是我唯一的被告证人
Oh, well, you're my only defence witness.

139
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,410
我不是被告的证人  
I'm not a defence witness.

140
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:10,890
可是你的朋友詹姆斯认为你是
Your friend James thinks you are.

141
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:11,470
他不是我的朋友
He's not my friend.

142
00:14:11,470 --> 00:14:12,470
为什么人们都认为他是我的朋友
Why does everyone assume that?

143
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
那他为什么会找你
Well, why else would he ask for you

144
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
你又为什么会来帮他
and why would you come here to help him?

145
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,230
我不是来帮他的  我是来收拾他的
I didn't come here to help him. I came here to bury him.

146
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,840
林斯基
Linsky.

147
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,800
杰克・雷彻到底是什么人
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

148
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,780
你到底为什么这么难找
So why are you so hard to find?

149
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,260
你们不可能找得到我
I'm impossible to find.

150
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,470
为什么
Why is that?

151
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,110
你可以这样认为
Well, you could say it started

152
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,980
这是我的职业习惯
out as an exercise and became an addiction.

153
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,140
你是在逃跑吗
Are you on the run?

154
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,690
我的车快开了  你最好快点  律师小姐
My bus is leaving. You better hurry, counsellor.

155
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,860
你是怎么认识詹姆斯・巴尔的
How do you know James Barr?

156
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,610
-你又为什么为他辩护  -因为我是律师
-Why are you representing him? -I'm a lawyer.

157
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:08,630
公设辩护律师也是律师
So is a public defender,

158
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,280
也能帮巴尔洗脱罪名
with just as much chance of clearing Barr.

159
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,780
我并不是要帮他脱罪
I'm not trying to clear him,

160
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,320
只是想让他免于死刑罢了
I am just trying to keep him off death row.

161
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,870
-通过证明他有精神病  -这是一个方法
-By proving he's insane? -Well, that's one option.

162
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,620
跟你爸爸作对是因为
And sticking it to your father because...

163
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,210
不是我爸爸  是地方检察官办公室
No. Not my father. The Office of the District Attorney.

164
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:25,000
因为小时候他们没有给你买小马吗
Because the Office of the District Attorney never bought you a pony.

165
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,960
罗丁检察官在死刑案上从没失败过
D.A. Rodin's never lost a capital case.

166
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:28,710
你知道为什么吗
You know why?

167
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,380
他诉讼工作做得好
Impeccable tailoring.

168
00:15:30,510 --> 00:15:32,140
是因为他从不打无准备之仗
He never picks a fight he can't win.

169
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,300
是个传奇人物啊
Worked for the Red Baron.

170
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,100
这里所有的嫌疑犯都会面临两个选择
Every murder suspect in this town is given a choice.

171
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,850
要么认罪  要么死刑
Confess or face death.

172
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:39,220
面对这样一个常胜地方检察官
Against a D.A. Who never loses.

173
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,480
有些我们事务所认为无罪的人
My firm has reason to believe more than one innocent man

174
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,060
都没有申辩就直接认罪了
has gone down without a fight.

175
00:15:43,690 --> 00:15:45,190
我明白了
Oh, I get it.

176
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,360
你是个理想主义者
You're an idealist.

177
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,690
不  我是个和平主义者
No. I'm a pacifist.

178
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,240
真是高尚
It's a noble crusade.

179
00:15:51,530 --> 00:15:55,240
但这次不用了  相信我  詹姆斯・巴尔有罪
But this is not the fight. Trust me. James Barr's guilty.

180
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,200
你都还没看过证物
You haven't even seen the evidence.

181
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,250
我们的谈话是保密的吧
Is this a privileged conversation?

182
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:05,200
当然  这是个客户会面
Of course, it's a client conference.

183
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:07,090
你所说的所有的话都是保密的
Nothing you say here can be repeated.

184
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,840
有四种人会去参军
There are four types of people who join the military.

185
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,720
一种是为了家族荣耀
For some, it's a family trade.

186
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,550
有些是爱国者  迫切想要为国服务
Others are patriots, eager to serve.

187
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,890
还有一些仅仅是把它当成一份工作
Next, you have those who just need a job.

188
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,070
另外还有一些人
Then there's the kind who

189
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:23,390
就是为了给杀人找个正当的理由
want a legal means of killing other people.

190
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,730
詹姆斯・巴尔就属于最后一种
James Barr was one of those.

191
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,070
他是一名狙击手
He made sniper.

192
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,400
刻苦训练  每周两千发
Trained hard. Two thousand rounds a week.

193
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,860
每一枪都要求
And with every shot, he's taught to visualise

194
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,530
瞄准脑门
the base of a man's skull through his reticle.

195
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,580
就是骨髓和脊柱交汇的地方
The sweet spot where the medulla meets the spine.

196
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,250
然后看到血雾喷出
Visualise that puff of pink mist.

197
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,920
终于  他被派往伊拉克
Finally, he's deployed to Iraq.

198
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,920
做掩护狙击手
He's put on overwatch.

199
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,460
每天他就通过瞄准镜观察每一个平民百姓
All day long he stares through a scope at civilians.

200
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,260
妇女
Women.

201
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,630
儿童
Children.

202
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,760
日复一日  就这样过了两年
Day in, day out, for two long years

203
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,890
却没有收到一次开枪的命令
without ever once being cleared to fire a single shot.

204
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,770
后来就要撤兵了
Then comes the drawdown.

205
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,400
对詹姆斯・巴尔来说  战争已经结束了
For James Barr, the war's over.

206
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,270
每周两千发的练习
Two thousand rounds a week.

207
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:12,780
军旅生涯中一共25万次的训练
A quarter million rounds in his career,

208
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:14,240
却从未对人开过一枪
not one at a human target.

209
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,610
你会感到饥渴  感到欲火中烧
You've been hungry. You've been horny.

210
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,280
心痒难耐却无法抓挠
You've had an itch you can't scratch.

211
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,790
想象那种感觉  日复一日  年复一年
Imagine that feeling. Days. Weeks. Years.

212
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,130
想象一下这种感觉经历了二十五万次
Imagine that feeling times 200,000, plus 50,000 more.

213
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,870
想象一下在53摄氏度的高温下
Imagine it's 130 degrees

214
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:33,340
明天你就要回家了
on the deck and tomorrow you're going home

215
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,420
你明白  如果你今天再不止痒的话
and you know if you don't scratch that itch now,

216
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,130
这种抓心挠肺的感觉就会一直跟着你
you never will.

217
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,140
你需要释放
You need a release.

218
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,300
你得找个目标
You need a target.

219
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,600
你从没想过要谁做目标
And the who of it never once enters your mind.

220
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,830
他做得干净利落
He covered his tracks well,

221
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,620
跟正常人一样
just like sane people do.

222
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,790
他差点就逍遥法外
He almost got away with it, too.

223
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:10,960
但我抓住了他  他也认罪了
But I caught him. And he confessed.

224
00:18:11,170 --> 00:18:12,840
那为什么他没有进监狱呢
So why didn't he go to prison?

225
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,140
巴尔不知道的是
What Barr didn't know that day

226
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:17,260
他杀的这四个承包商
was the four civilian contractors he'd picked off

227
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,680
周末刚参加过所谓的强奸晚会
just spent the weekend at what they call a rape-rally.

228
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:24,850
二十八个女性  年龄大的54岁  小的只有11岁
It was 28 women, ages 54 on down to 11.

229
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:26,820
这些还只是
Those were just the ones

230
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,850
我在结案前找到的
I could find before the case was shut down.

231
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:32,020
挖得越深  现实就越丑陋
See, the deeper I dug, the uglier it got.

232
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,690
连续七年这个团体都是圆满完成任务
And after seven long years of "Mission Accomplished,"

233
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,280
有人希望
someone in the corporation

234
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,360
隐瞒真相
just wanted the whole thing to end quietly.

235
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,020
因此他们就借战争的烟雾
So they chalked it up to the fog of war,

236
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,370
将这些杀人案件抹得了无痕迹
made the murders go away.

237
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,830
这都是机密信息
This is classified information.

238
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,870
这也是我们谈话要保密的原因
And that's why the privilege.

239
00:18:49,210 --> 00:18:51,210
但你已经准备告诉地方检察官了
But you were ready to tell this to the D.A.

240
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:55,250
我上次见巴尔的时候  我向他保证过
The last time I saw Barr, I made him a promise.

241
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:59,220
当我在新闻上看到他时  我就来兑现承诺了
And when I saw his name on the news, I came here to keep it.

242
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:03,090
-但是现在没必要了  -你怎么能确定呢
-But now I know I don't have to. -How can you be sure?

243
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,720
你连证物都没看
You still haven't seen the evidence.

244
00:19:06,060 --> 00:19:09,810
但你父亲已经看过了  他从不打无准备之仗
Your father has. And he doesn't pick a fight he can't win.

245
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:12,400
巴尔不能再次逃脱罪责了
Barr's not getting away with murder again.

246
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,400
还是有可能的
He might.

247
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,240
他在监禁中受到了严重的脑损伤
He suffered a severe brain injury in state custody.

248
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,150
他醒来的时候  如果他能醒来的话
When he wakes up, if he wakes up,

249
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,510
他可能已经忘了这次枪击案
he may not remember the event,

250
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,030
忘了所有的事
he may not remember anything at all.

251
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,740
那就不是詹姆斯・巴尔是否有罪的问题了
And this case won't be about James Barr's guilt or innocence.

252
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,120
而是他能不能出庭受审的问题了
It'll be about his ability to stand trial.

253
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,420
听了我说的这些  你还想为他辩护吗
After everything I just told you, you still want to defend him?

254
00:19:36,550 --> 00:19:38,590
我想他得到公正的审判
I want to see he gets a fair trial.

255
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,260
你说他在巴格达认罪了
You said he confessed in Baghdad.

256
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:45,430
可这次他还没有认罪
He didn't confess this time.

257
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,890
-因为这次他更自信  -因为这次他找了你
-This time he knows better. -This time he asked for you.

258
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,230
我想知道原因
I want to know why.

259
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:54,350
你也想知道原因  我能看得出来你的煎熬
You want to know why. I can see it's eating you.

260
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:56,020
而你又不能问巴尔原因
And you can't ask Barr,

261
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,440
地方检察官又不让你看证物
and the D.A. Won't let you see the evidence.

262
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:01,560
我的主调查员
My lead investigator has

263
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:04,450
可以接触到证物  所有的证物
complete access to the evidence. All of it.

264
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:08,100
你的调查员在哪儿
So where's your lead investigator?

265
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:09,410
正打算坐车出城呢
About to catch a bus out of town.

266
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,090
谢谢你的咖啡  律师小姐
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.

267
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,860
你知道你要我看的不仅仅是证物
You understand you're not just asking me to look at the evidence.

268
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,730
而是个冷血杀手
You're asking me to look at a cold-blooded killer.

269
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,360
我明知这个人有罪  你却想让他免于死刑
A man I know to be guilty. A man you want to keep off death row.

270
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,320
你要求我客观地看待他
And you're asking me to look at him objectively.

271
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,370
不错  这正是我要求的
Yes, that is what I'm asking.

272
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,880
可以  但有个条件
I'll do it. On one condition.

273
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,880
什么
Name it.

274
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,380
你也要客观地看待那些受害者
You have to look at the victims objectively.

275
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,550
那你要我怎么做呢
How do you suggest I do that?

276
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,730
-你找谁  -法里奥先生吗
-Yes? -Mr Farrior?

277
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,890
我是海伦・罗丁  我们通过电话
I'm Helen Rodin. We spoke on the phone.

278
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,230
想起来了
Of course.

279
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:02,900
你说你在为那个杀人
You said you're defending the man that ki...

280
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:04,570
那个人辩护
That man.

281
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,070
是的  我是詹姆斯・巴尔的代表律师
I represent James Barr, yes.

282
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
你想了解有关我女儿的事情
And you have questions about my daughter?

283
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,410
是的
I do.

284
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,580
为什么
What for?

285
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,750
我想更好地了解一下那些被害人平时
I was hoping to get a better sense of who the victims were as...

286
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,630
他们日常生活中是什么样子的
That is to say, who they were as people. As human beings.

287
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,100
以你的身份来说  这样做挺奇怪的  不是吗
That's a bit unusual, considering your position, isn't it?

288
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:34,430
确实是
That is true.

289
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,270
通常情况下  我们都尽可能让陪审团
Normally someone in my position would want the jury

290
00:22:38,390 --> 00:22:40,770
少了解那些
to know as little as possible about the...

291
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,770
你的当事人杀死的受害者
The people that your client killed.

292
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,110
无情杀死的人
In cold blood.

293
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,030
你和其他受害人家庭谈过了吗
Have you spoken with the other families?

294
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:57,250
是的  跟那些愿意跟我交谈的谈过了
Yeah, some. The ones who would speak with me.

295
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,050
进来吧
Come in.

296
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,470
谢谢
Thank you.

297
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,750
克丽丝的工作是保姆
Chrissie was a nanny.

298
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:13,050
那天她要照看一个小女孩
She had a little girl with her that day.

299
00:25:13,380 --> 00:25:14,420
我知道
Yes, I know.

300
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:19,760
你会去找那个小孩谈话吗
Are you gonna go talk with that child?

301
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,760
不  当然不会  我
No, of course not. I...

302
00:25:22,930 --> 00:25:23,930
为什么呢
Why not?

303
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,900
-我觉得那样太  -太麻木不仁
-Well, I think it would be... -Insensitive?

304
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,610
还是不太合适
Inappropriate?

305
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,780
所有有关我女儿的材料
Everything that you want to know about my daughter

306
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,160
都在这里了
is right here.

307
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:43,450
《公报》上写得很清楚
The Gazette did a nice piece on her.

308
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,920
还有不清楚的可以去读一下她的讣告
Her obituary does the rest.

309
00:25:51,130 --> 00:25:54,590
谢谢你  我一定会认真读的
Thank you. I'll definitely have a look.

310
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,340
罗丁小姐  你是个好律师吗
You a good attorney, Miss Rodin?

311
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,640
-这真的不适合我来  -请
-That's not really for me to... -Just

312
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,430
回答问题
answer the question.

313
00:26:03,470 --> 00:26:06,980
是的  我认为自己是一名好律师
Yes, I suppose I am pretty good.

314
00:26:07,270 --> 00:26:09,150
出色到可以让他免于死刑
Good enough to keep that man off death row?

315
00:26:10,310 --> 00:26:11,650
其实
You know,

316
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:13,440
我想我该走了
I think maybe I should go.

317
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,150
你坐好
You stay where you are.

318
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,830
那个男人该死  罗丁小姐
That man deserves to die, Miss Rodin.

319
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,120
你为什么要为他辩护呢
Why would you defend him?

320
00:26:28,330 --> 00:26:31,330
我明白我犯了个很严重的错误
I can see that I have made a terrible mistake.

321
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,510
真是非常抱歉  我保证再也不来打搅你了
And I'm very, very sorry and I promise I won't bother you again.

322
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,310
爸爸
Hello, Dad.

323
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,730
你到底在干什么
What the hell are you doing?

324
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,360
我在  什么
What am I... What?

325
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,560
是真的吗
Is it true?

326
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,690
你去找受害者的家人  你一个人
You're talking to the victims' families? You? Alone?

327
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,780
你怎么知道的  你怎么知道我在这里的
How do you know that? How did you find me here?

328
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,160
我是地方检察官  这是我的工作
I'm the District Attorney. It's my business to know.

329
00:27:01,240 --> 00:27:02,280
你还是没回答我的问题
That's not an answer.

330
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,540
并不是只有你有出色的调查员  海伦
Well, you're not the only one with crack investigators, Helen.

331
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,370
不错  我知道雷彻
That's right. I know about Reacher.

332
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,040
你的调查员是个退伍兵
Your lead investigator is a war veteran

333
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,710
而且还失踪了两年
who's been missing for the last two years.

334
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,670
你怎么能保证他的心态正常呢
How can you vouch for his state of mind?

335
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,050
你怎么能相信他说的话呢
How can you trust anything he tells you?

336
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,380
你不了解他
You don't know the man.

337
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,720
那你说  他知道你不会给他付工资吗
Tell me this, does he know you can't pay him?

338
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,220
他知道你们事务所根本不想接这个案子吗
That your own firm didn't want this case?

339
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,560
他知道根本没人想接这个案子吗
That nobody wants this case?

340
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,520
你的当事人昏迷之前也根本没和你交谈过
You never even spoke to your client before he wound up in a coma.

341
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:34,850
听我说  听着
Oh, now listen to me! Listen.

342
00:27:34,850 --> 00:27:36,230
听着  我是以你父亲的身份在跟你说
Listen, I'm speaking as your father.

343
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,480
不论过去我们有什么分歧
Whatever our differences have been in the past,

344
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,240
你现在一定要听我说
you gotta listen to me now.

345
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,570
你犯了一个很严重的错误
You're making a terrible mistake.

346
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,410
这个案子你不可能赢的
You cannot win this case.

347
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,410
你会毁了自己的事业  为什么  到底为什么
You're going to ruin your career. Why? For what?

348
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,420
为了伤害我  还是为了改变我
To hurt me? To change me?

349
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,250
-海伦  -别碰我
-Helen... -Don't touch me!

350
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,100
多谢你让我查看证物
Thanks for letting me take a look.

351
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,310
我们很喜欢犯罪嫌疑人的朋友
Hey. We love it when friends of the accused

352
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,060
来插手我们的工作
try to tear our work to shreds.

353
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,610
他不是我的朋友
He's not my friend.

354
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,780
随你怎么说吧  找到什么疑点了吗
So you keep saying. Find any holes?

355
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,280
其实你们根本没必要把他送到医院的
Well, you didn't have to put him in the hospital.

356
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,450
除了这点  其他做得都不错  案情简单明了
Other than that, damn fine police work. It's open and shut.

357
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,200
没办法  犯罪现场就像一个金矿  证物累累啊
What can I say? The scene was a gold mine.

358
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,790
拜托  不是人人都找得到证据
Come on. Now we both know gold's only as good as the man digging.

359
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,640
好吧  什么时候你想来
Yeah, well, anytime you want to come back,

360
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:36,790
再看这些证物的话
take a look at this stuff...

361
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,630
不用了  谢谢  没必要
No, thanks. Don't need to.

362
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,460
你怎么不做笔记呢
You never took any notes.

363
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,130
我不用做笔记
I don't need to.

364
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,300
看来你在部队真是个神人啊
So you were some real hot shit in the Army, huh?

365
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,260
一般吧
I did all right.

366
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,310
军队警察到底负责什么工作  劝架吗
So what does an Army cop do mostly? Break up bar fights?

367
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,810
跟你做的工作差不多  只有一点小区别
I did what you do pretty much, with one minor difference.

368
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,020
是什么
What's that?

369
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,820
我面对的每一个罪犯都是训练有素的
Every suspect was a trained killer.

370
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,110
再次感谢
Thanks again.

371
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,160
你觉得他停车的时候为什么要投币缴费呢
Why do you think he paid for parking?

372
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:14,790
什么
Pardon?

373
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,670
他马上就要向一群陌生人连开六枪
He's about to fire six shots into a crowd of strangers.

374
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,170
还会担心被贴罚单吗
And he's worried about the meter maid?

375
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,010
他就是疯了  不行吗
"Simple loony" Won't do it for you?

376
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,340
我还是喜欢有其他的推论
I like to have at least one alternate theory.

377
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,680
习惯
Habit.

378
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,680
肌肉记忆
Muscle memory.

379
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,350
或者他根本没意识到他投币了
I don't think he knew he was doing it.

380
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,690
我说过  你们干得不错
Like I said, it's damn fine work.

381
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,020
大兵
Hey, Army.

382
00:29:41,690 --> 00:29:43,690
枪上的序列号是多少
What's the serial number on the rifle?

383
00:29:48,030 --> 00:29:49,120
你知道他用的那枚硬币是哪年的吗
What's the date on the quarter?

384
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:53,540
1968年
1968.

385
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,710
只见树木不见森林啊  探长
Forest for the trees, Detective.

386
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,710
只见树木不见森林
Forest for the trees.

387
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,370
我能坐这儿吗
Mind if I share your table?

388
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,100
桑迪  又有多沙的意思

389
00:31:19,370 --> 00:31:20,460
我叫桑迪
I'm Sandy.

390
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,630
我也是  上周
So was I. Last week.

391
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:26,460
我去了佛罗里达州的海滩
On a beach, in Florida.

392
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:31,550
你叫什么
What's your name?

393
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,970
吉米・里斯
Jimmie Reese.

394
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,560
吉米不像是你的名字
You don't look like a Jimmie.

395
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,690
那我该叫什么
What do I look like?

396
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,480
不知道  反正不是吉米
I don't know. But not a Jimmie.

397
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,900
你是新来的吗
So you're new in town?

398
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:50,990
算是吧
Usually.

399
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,490
这有点吵
It's kind of loud in here.

400
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,830
想去个安静点的地方吗  我有车
Do you want to maybe go someplace quieter? I have a car.

401
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,500
你够开车的年龄吗
You're old enough to drive?

402
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,750
我到了可以做许多事的年龄
I'm old enough to do a lot of things.

403
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,670
我没有钱  桑迪
I'm on a budget, Sandy.

404
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,250
什么
What?

405
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,840
我没钱付你
I can't afford you.

406
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,510
我不是妓女
I'm not a hooker.

407
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,180
那我更养不起你了
Then I really can't afford you.

408
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,010
真的  我在汽车配件店工作
Seriously, I work at the auto parts store.

409
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,130
我的意思是
What I mean is,

410
00:32:18,130 --> 00:32:20,680
人们都愿意找最便宜的女人
the cheapest woman tends to be the one you pay for.

411
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,690
我不是妓女
I am not a hooker!

412
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,360
也对  妓女都开得起玩笑的
No. A hooker would get the joke.

413
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,530
-发生什么事了  -他说我是妓女
-What's this? -He called me a whore.

414
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,700
是吗
Is that true?

415
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,200
我没说妓女  她自以为的  我说的是荡妇
Well, nobody said whore. She inferred hooker, but I meant slut.

416
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,210
她是我们的妹妹
Hey. That's our sister.

417
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,540
她接吻技术好吗
Is she a good kisser?

418
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,550
出来
Hey. Outside.

419
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,380
你先去付账吧
Pay your cheque first.

420
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,590
我一会再付
I'll pay later.

421
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,220
你一会儿就付不了了
You won't be able to.

422
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,720
是吗
You think?

423
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,390
当然  你要试试吗
All the time. You should try it.

424
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,970
真好笑  不过我要狠狠揍你一顿
It's a great joke, but I'm going to beat your ass.

425
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,810
你是想在这挨揍还是去外面
Do you want to do that here or outside?

426
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,400
出去
Outside.

427
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,320
留在这  桑迪
Stay here, Sandy.

428
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,320
我倒是想见血
I don't mind the sight of blood.

429
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,080
当然  见血说明你没怀孕
When it means you're not pregnant, anyway.

430
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,770
你现在还觉得好笑吗  讨厌鬼
You still think you're funny now, creep?

431
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,430
闭嘴  桑迪  没人跟你说话
Shut your mouth, Sandy! No one is talking to you.

432
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,360
现在跑还来得及
It's your last chance to walk away.

433
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,110
开玩笑吧  我们五对一
Are you kidding? It's five against one.

434
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,120
是三对一
It's three against one.

435
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,450
你不识数吗
How do you figure?

436
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:07,370
一旦我把领头的打倒  也就是你
Well, once I take out the leader, which is you,

437
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,290
还得再对付一两个热血的小跟班
I'll have to contend with one or two enthusiastic wingmen.

438
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,800
剩下的两个通常会逃命
The last two guys, they always run.

439
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,630
你以前干过吗
You've done this before?

440
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,220
是啊
Yeah.

441
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,640
不早了
It's getting late.

442
00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,390
记住
Remember,

443
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,560
是你自找的
you wanted this.

444
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,110
没事  你没事
It's okay. You're okay.

445
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:37,240
起来
Get up.

446
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,500
好吧
Okay.

447
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:50,250
现在我们知道谁是谁了
Now we know who's who.

448
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:51,920
来吧
Let's get this done.

449
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,850
还来
Really?

450
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,520
妈的
Shit!

451
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,870
趴在地上
On the ground!

452
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,950
反应真神速啊  伙计们
That's a pretty impressive response time, fellas.

453
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,370
趴下
Do it!

454
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,710
手背后面
Hands behind your back.

455
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,050
谁指使你的
Who hired you?

456
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,390
我们走
Let's go.

457
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,320
你好  海伦
Hey, Helen.

458
00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,410
我香水喷太多了吗
Am I wearing too much perfume?

459
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:08,410
是我闻得太仔细  爱默生探长
Breathing too sternly. Detective Emerson.

460
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,250
-有人死了吗  -如果有呢
-Somebody dead? -And if someone is?

461
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,250
那他们肯定是羞辱死的  我下手很轻了
Then they died of shame. 'Cause I was being gentle.

462
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:19,590
我大概明白你为什么要到处跑了  雷彻
I'm starting to understand why you move around a lot, Reacher.

463
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,670
这么说没有人死
So no one's dead.

464
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,590
有人可能没办法正常走路了
One guy likely won't ever walk right again.

465
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,100
-你想控告我  -非常想
-You want to charge me. -Very much.

466
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,430
但没有人提起诉讼
But no one's pressing.

467
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,270
可悲的是  没有
Sadly, no.

468
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,350
我可以走了吗
Am I free to go?

469
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,110
等一下  爱默生
Hey, Emerson.

470
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,780
4862681
4862681.

471
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,620
什么
What's that?

472
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,700
巴尔步枪的编号
It's the serial number on Barr's rifle.

473
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,460
你是为我工作的  明白吗
You're working for me, do you understand that?

474
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,030
你所做的一切都关系我的事务所
So everything you do is a reflection on my firm.

475
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:03,630
关系着我的名誉
On me.

476
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,800
我是被陷害的
I was set up.

477
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,050
你在跟律师说话
You're talking to a lawyer.

478
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,050
有个女孩  跟我搭讪  寻衅打架
There was this girl. She came onto me. Picked a fight.

479
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,720
酒吧里常有的事
Which never happens in a bar.

480
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,890
听到我的名字时她很吃惊
She was thrown when I told her my name.

481
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,140
她以为是迈克・泰森[重量级拳王]吗
She was expecting Mike Tyson?

482
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,980
她没预料到是吉米・里斯
She wasn't expecting Jimmie Reese.

483
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,730
洋基队的二垒手
Yankees second baseman.

484
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,230
你为什么说你是洋基队二垒手
Why did you say you were a Yankees second baseman?

485
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,150
我总是用洋基队二垒手的名字
I always use Yankees second basemen.

486
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:27,160
我并没说我就是洋基队二垒手
I didn't say I was a Yankees second baseman,

487
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,490
我只是说
I just said...

488
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,160
问题是
Look, the point is,

489
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,160
她希望听到的是杰克・雷彻
she was expecting to hear "Jack Reacher."

490
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,410
她知道我是谁
She knew who I was.

491
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
甚至还没开打  警察就出动了
And the cops were rolling before the fight even started.

492
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,500
那五个小子是她的哥哥  得了吧
And those five guys are her brothers? Come on.

493
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,170
有人派这些人来对付我
Someone sent those boys to put me down.

494
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:47,510
谁
Who?

495
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:52,640
如果说今天有人在河边跟踪你
If someone followed you at the river today,

496
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,520
那很可能是警察  而且我很怀疑
it was probably a cop. And I highly doubt...

497
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,100
有三件事警察永远不会做
There are three things cops never do.

498
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,850
凯迪拉克:知名豪华车品牌 象征权力和尊贵

499
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:58,850
他们不投票给民主党  不会开凯迪拉克
They don't vote Democrat, they don't drive Cadillacs,

500
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,110
不会开私车办公
and they never use personal vehicles.

501
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,610
那不是警察
It's not a cop.

502

505

521
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:08,800
她的付出终于有了回报

她说她要去保养汽车

530
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,530

531
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:35,740
很完美

532
00:39:35,830 --> 00:39:36,970
她告诉店员

全国最大的承包商之一以后

她的丈夫把生命献给了公司

但她却不想卖掉

547
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,080
她那天要去申请担保贷款
She was on her way to secure a loan that day

548
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,420

553
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:42,020
但当时并不愉快
but they weren't kind.

554
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,690
达伦尸体旁有一束玫瑰

555
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:46,770

让她的妻子感到安慰的是

詹姆斯・巴尔该死
James Barr should die.

567
00:41:43,410 --> 00:41:44,500
也许死不足惜
Maybe he should.

568
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:46,420
我是说  你对受害者了解到了什么
I meant, what did you learn about the victims.

569
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:47,540
你还想听什么
What more do you want?

570
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,840
五个无辜的人被毫无原由地被谋杀了

571

573
00:41:55,010 --> 00:41:56,090
你把行李弄丢了吗
You lose your luggage?

574

我没有行李
I don't have any luggage.

575
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,680
我刚才说到哪了
What was I saying?

576
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:01,680
五个无辜的人
Five innocent people.

577
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,350
毫无缘由地被杀了  对
Murdered at random, yes.

578
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,100
你知道这个国家每年会死多少人吗

579
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,770
250万
Two and a half million.

580
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,190
这就意味着每一天
That means every day,

581
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,110
都平均有7000人死亡
roughly 7,000 average Americans wake up for the last time.

583
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:20,490
死在了同一地点
converged on a single spot and died together.

584
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,620
这是偶然吗
Is that random?

585
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,120
你觉得是什么呢
What else would you call it?

586
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,410
比如说达伦和南希吧  他们可能有恋情
Well, take Darren and Nancy. Odds are they were having an affair.

587
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,540
你说什么
Excuse me?

588
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,330
人们不会在上班的路上给妻子买玫瑰的
You don't buy roses for your wife on the way to work.

589
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,130
而是在下班回家的时候买
You buy them on the way home.

590
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,800
还有纪念日就在周末
And you don't worry about a charge showing up on your credit card

591
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,630
你是不会介意信用卡的消费记录的
when your anniversary is that weekend.

592
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,970
除非你在掩藏这个礼物
Unless it's the gift you're hiding.

593
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,020
这就是为什么在别人都跑开的时候
And that's why she kept walking

594
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,390
她却继续走过去
while everyone else ran.

595
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,980
你怎么可以证明
You can't prove that.

596
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,570
有什么难的  手机  邮件
How hard would it be? Cell phones, e-mails.

597
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,650
只要有人愿意调查
All it takes is someone willing to dig.

598
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,820
你到底想说什么
What's your point exactly?

599
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:02,090
我的意思是
My point is that

600
00:43:02,090 --> 00:43:04,410
有两个受害者严格来说并不是偶然的
two of the victims weren't there strictly by chance.

601
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,250
我需要巴尔朋友的名单
I need a list of Barr's known associates.

602
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,500
没有  他没有朋友
There isn't one. He didn't have any.

603
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,560
他是典型的独行者
He's a classic loner.

604
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,750
甚至都不跟邻居说话
He didn't even talk to his neighbours.

605
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,250
他是个安静的人  从不打扰别人
He was a quiet man. Never bothered anyone.

606
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,670
是啊
Yeah, exactly.

607
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,270
你有他的信用卡清单吗
You have his credit card statement?

608
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,930
可以弄到  为什么要
I can get it. Why?

609

我需要他所有的活动地点

所有有人见过他的地方
Anywhere someone would remember him.

613
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,890
我们想要找什么呢
What do we hope to find?

614
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,190
我得睡觉了
I need some sleep.

615
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,770
你也是
You, too.

616
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,860
你不会以为我
You don't really think I'm gonna...

617
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,620
7点来接我
Be back to pick me up at 7:00.

618
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,370
好  没问题
Yep. Absolutely.

619
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,830
你和谁来的
Who's with you?

620
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,500
发生什么了
What happened?

621
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,340
是他  对吧
That's him, isn't it?

622
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,500
我没看到你
I ain't seeing you, man!

623
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,420
放松  发生什么了
Relax. What happened?

624
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,300
巴尔的律师雇了一个探员

625
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,510
叫雷彻  是个高级军队调查员
Name of Reacher. Some sort of top-shelf Army cop.

626
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,680
他和巴尔曾同在巴格达
He was in Baghdad the same time as Barr.

627
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,520
然后呢
So?

628
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,360
巴尔点名要这个军人
So Barr asked for this soldier by name.

629
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,320
今天他出现在河边  然后去了高速路
Then he shows up at the river today. Then up on the highway.

630
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,190
看起来像是知道了什么
Almost like he knew something.

631
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,700
你说过我们不喜欢别人插手
And you said we don't like people asking questions.

632
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,200
对  当然不喜欢
No, we sure don't.

633
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,780
所以我采取了行动
So I took steps.

634
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,870
你采取了行动
You took steps.

635
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,370
本地人  我手下
Local people. My guys.

636
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,290
你搞砸了
And it blew back on you.

637
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,920
我以为五个人能搞定
I figured five guys would do it.

638
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,050
你要清楚你的权限
This franchise was yours to manage.

639
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:21,950
到此为止
That's all.

640
00:45:21,950 --> 00:45:24,220
采取行动是我们的事  明白吗
Maintenance is our thing, you understand?

641
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,340
我明白  但是我联系不上你
Yeah, I understand. I couldn't reach you!

642
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,470
我们就是这样工作的
Well, that's how this works.

643
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,890
我不得不做个决定
Well, I had to make a decision!

644
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:29,790
我需要这几个本地人的名字
These locals, I want their names.

645
00:45:29,790 --> 00:45:30,680
在文件里
It's in the file.

646
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:31,970
有人知道你的身份吗
Any of them know who you are?

647
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,140
只有一个  不过我打点好了
Just one, but I took care of it.

648
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,650
你
You...

649
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,560
-尸体在哪  -分尸了
-Where's the body? -It's distributed.

650
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:41,730
别这样  没人会发现的
Relax! No one's gonna find it.

651
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:42,690
要是我们想让别人发现呢
Suppose we want it found, yeah?

652
00:45:42,690 --> 00:45:44,150
为什么
Why the hell would you want it found?

653
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,240
因为我们有自己的做事方式
'Cause we got a way of doing things so they stay done.

654
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,070
干净利落
Clean!

655
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,200
失踪一个人不叫干净利落
A missing person isn't clean.

656
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,750
老天啊  你只需要杀该死的一个人
Christ's sakes, man. You only had to kill one goddamn person.

657
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,250
却杀了五个  这也叫干净利落
You tapped five! You call that clean?

658
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:56,470
这叫不留痕迹
I call it done.

659
00:45:56,470 --> 00:45:59,500
他们在调查枪手  而不是目标
They're looking at the shooter, not the target.

660
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,750
天啊
Jesus.

661
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,840
现在已经够乱了  以后就不会再乱了
We make it messy now so it won't get messy later.

662
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,090
我们不能留下任何问题
And we don't leave questions unanswered ever.

663
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,260
好  好吧  我会弥补
Okay, all right. Okay. I can fix this.

664
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,020
-睁开眼  -不  我没看到你
-Open your eyes. -No, I ain't seeing you!

665
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,100
现在无所谓了
It makes no difference now.

666
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:27,110
我做错了
I made a mistake.

667
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,870
我还有用  只要告诉我怎么弥补
I mean, you can still use me, just tell me how to fix...

668
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:32,140
想活命  就别说弥补
To survive. Don't say "Fix it,"

669
00:46:32,140 --> 00:46:33,790
因为你弥补不了
Because you can't.

670
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,120
我们刚收拾完烂摊子  你就又搞砸了
We covered up the one mess. You made another.

671
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,960
好吧  你说得对
All right. You're right.

672
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,540
你说得对  对极了  对不起
You're right. You're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

673
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:43,300
告诉我该怎么做
Just tell me what I have to do.

674
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,050
西伯利亚位于俄罗斯北部 气候寒冷

675
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,050
我曾在西伯利亚坐牢
I was in prison in Siberia.

676
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,140
穿着死人的衣服过了第一个冬天
I spent my first winter wearing a dead man's coat.

677
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,640
口袋破了洞
A hole in one pocket.

678
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,970
我在手指冻烂之前
I chewed these fingers off

679
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,140
把它们咬了下来
before the frostbite could turn to gangrene.

680
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:05,150
这几个是为了逃避硫矿劳动咬掉的
These I gave up to avoid working in the sulphur mine.

681
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,990
很多人死了  而我就是这样活下来的
That is how I survived when so many others did not.

682
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,660
像这样难得的人一定会有所作为
A man this rare can always be of use.

683
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,160
给我看看  你有多难得
So show me. Show me you are rare.

684
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,420
让我看看你为了活下去能做什么
Show me you'll do anything to survive.

685
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,460
我不明白
I don't understand.

686
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,510
你左手手指
The fingers from your left hand.

687
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,330
你有  你有刀吗
Have you... Have you got a knife?

688
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,120
我在西伯利亚的时候有刀吗
Did I have a knife in Siberia?

689
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,460
别  拜托  别开玩笑了
No... Come on, you've got to be kidding.

690
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,630
你可以做到的
You can do it.

691
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,380
让我看看
Show me.

692
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,580
天啊
Christ!

693
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,880
不行  我不行
Can't! I can't.

694
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,130
还是选择吃枪子
Always the bullet.

695
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,840
真不明白
I don't understand.

696
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,760
那当兵的怎么办
What do we do about the soldier?

697
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,020
照老规矩办
What we always do.

698
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,530
巴尔的信用卡清单  目击者证词
Barr's credit card statement. Eyewitness testimonies.

699
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,280
咖啡  你要不加奶的  对吧
Coffee. You take it black, right?

700
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,620
我能怎么办  我只能在家里工作
Yeah. What can I say? I take my work home.

701
00:49:36,390 --> 00:49:39,050
巴尔的信用卡清单恐怕是个死胡同
Afraid Barr's credit card statement's a dead end.

702
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:42,450
没有酒吧或脱衣舞俱乐部  什么也没有
No bars, no strip joints, nothing.

703
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:44,060
基本只是加油站和杂货店
Pretty much just gas and groceries.

704
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,430
我需要你查一下
I need you to look for gun ranges

705
00:49:47,430 --> 00:49:49,560
距此100至150英里的射击场
between 100 and 150 miles from here.

706
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,650
只找射击距离在300码以上的
Limit your search to ranges longer than 300 yards.

707
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:54,070
可以  但得告诉我原因
Sure, if you tell me why.

708
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:56,660
巴尔每周六都去加油
Barr consistently filled his tank on Saturday,

709
00:49:56,740 --> 00:49:57,990
周日又要加
and again on Sunday.

710
00:49:58,070 --> 00:49:59,620
说明他几乎每周末都跑长途
He took a long drive almost every weekend.

711
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:02,080
-去哪都有可能  -是的
-He could be going anywhere. -Yes.

712
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,790
如果是去酒吧
And if it's bars,

713
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,190
保龄球馆  或脱衣舞俱乐部
bowling alleys or strip clubs,

714
00:50:05,190 --> 00:50:06,160
我们肯定找不到
we'll never find it.

715
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,580
但是比赛级别的靶场呢  很可能有两个
But a Match-level gun range? There might be two.

716
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,210
并且他用的是自制子弹
And he made his own bullets.

717
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:13,510
说明他经常射击
That means he shot a lot.

718
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,010
我猜他每个周六都会去
I'm guessing every Saturday.

719
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,590
也许是和朋友一起
Maybe with a friend.

720
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:21,430
为什么找他的朋友这么重要
Why is it so important you talk to his friends?

721
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,600
前提是他有朋友
Assuming he had any.

722
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,350
我要在汽车配件店下车
Drop me at the auto parts store.

723
00:50:24,430 --> 00:50:26,270
等等  哪一个
I... Wait. Which one?

724
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,850
不知道  她只说了汽车配件店
I don't know. She just said "The auto parts store."

725
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,980
她  她是谁
She? Who?

726
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,610
雷彻  能说的具体点吗
Reacher, can you be a little more specific?

727
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:34,030
我不是说哪一家汽车配件店
I didn't say "An auto parts store."

728
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,650
你第一个想到的配件店是哪家
Which one stands out in your mind as the auto parts store?

729
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,870
要我等你吗
You want me to wait?

730
00:50:49,960 --> 00:50:51,830
不用  我晚点去办公室找你
No, I'll meet you back at the office later.

731
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,880
你怎么过去
How will you get there?

732
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,130
搭便车
I'll hitch a ride.

733
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,930
需要点什么
Can I help you?

734
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,300
桑迪在这工作吗
Sandy work here?

735
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,720
找她什么事
What's this about?

736
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,930
就是说她在  谢谢  我要跟她谈谈
So she does, thanks. I need to speak with her.

737
00:51:50,020 --> 00:51:51,440
是私事
It's a personal matter.

738
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:54,900
-她正在工作  -法律上的私事
-She's on the clock. -Legal personal matter.

739
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,190
你是什么人  警察吗
What are you, a cop?

740
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,360
叫她出来  加里
Call her out, Gary.

741
00:52:00,700 --> 00:52:03,030
-我要看你证件  -叫桑迪出来
-I'm gonna need to see some I.D. -Go get Sandy.

742
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,620
我要看你的证件
Well, I need to see something.

743
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,750
看看救护车怎么样
How about the inside of an ambulance?

744
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,750
好吧  我要报警
Okay, I'm calling the police.

745
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,460
我觉得桑迪不想警察掺和进来
I don't think Sandy wants the police involved

746
00:52:19,550 --> 00:52:20,800
不然问她吧
but let's ask.

747
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,090
站住  你
Hey! You...

748
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,300
你好  我需要帮助  你站住
Hello? I need some help. Hello? Hey! You!

749
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:29,350
你不能进来
No. You are not allowed back in here, man!

750
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:36,610
该死
Shit.

751
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,320
你认识他吗
You know this guy?

752
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:42,650
告诉他
Tell him.

753
00:52:43,910 --> 00:52:45,280
你先出去  加里
Give us a few, Gary.

754
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,050
听着  不是我  我不知道
Listen, I wasn't... I didn't know.

755
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,720
我不知道会这样
I didn't know that was going to happen!

756
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:09,560
是杰布
It was Jeb.

757
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:12,350
高个子的那个
The big guy.

758
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,350
杰布・奥利弗
Jeb Oliver.

759
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:19,190
他说你会吃这一套
He told me you were a predator.

760
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,650
以为你会上钩
You were supposed to start groping me.

761
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,620
别伤害我
Just don't hurt me.

762
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,200
桑迪  坐下
Sandy, sit down.

763
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,330
杰布在哪
Where can I find Jeb?

764
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,500
不知道  他今天没来上班
I don't know. He didn't come to work today.

765
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,880
这么说他也在这工作
So he works here.

766
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,550
是的
Yeah.

767
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,550
工作只是幌子  他制毒
It's bullshit, though. He cooks crystal.

768
00:53:45,630 --> 00:53:47,090
给我他的地址
His address, write it down.

769
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:51,890
真的很抱歉  先生
I'm really sorry, mister.

770
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,560
我当时以为你是个变态
You were supposed to be a pervert.

771
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,230
而且这100块赚得容易
And it was an easy 100 bucks.

772
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:00,570
就这么点
That's all?

773
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,650
杰布说什么就得做什么
When Jeb asks, you do what he says.

774
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,580
我惹上麻烦了吗
Am I in trouble?

775
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,420
把你的车借我就没事了
Not if you lend me your car.

776
00:54:18,170 --> 00:54:20,630
-我没有车  -你当然有  就在外面
-I don't have a car. -Well, sure you do. It's outside.

777
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,710
我猜是那辆卡玛洛
I'm guessing you're the Camaro.

778
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,050
那辆奇怪的小皮卡一看就是加里的
That whimsy little pickup has Gary written all over it.

779
00:54:25,050 --> 00:54:25,720
钥匙呢
Keys?

780
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,260
我不能给你钥匙  那是杰布的车
I can't. It's Jeb's car!	

781
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,640
我替他开回家给他个惊喜
Well, won't he be surprised when I drive it home for him.

782
00:54:38,690 --> 00:54:40,100
你到底是什么人  先生
Who are you, mister?

783
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,770
说实话
Really?

784
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:51,200
我不过是个喜欢独来独往的人
I'm just a guy who wants to be left alone.

785
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,240
我6点下班
I get off work at six!

786
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,500
也许我们可以
Maybe we could...

787
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,630
桑迪  听着
Sandy, listen.

788
00:55:02,380 --> 00:55:04,090
你是个好姑娘
Now, you seem like a sweet girl.

789
00:55:05,050 --> 00:55:06,380
你很漂亮
You're pretty.

790
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,880
显然也很聪明
You're obviously sharp,

791
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,640
加里的工作都是你帮他做的
doing Gary's books for him.

792
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,890
你不必受这些家伙的利用
You don't have to let these guys use you.

793
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:19,480
我这样的女孩子还能怎么做
It's just what girls like me do.

794
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,770
你有钱吗
You got money?

795
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,150
有一点
A little.

796
00:55:28,400 --> 00:55:29,990
出去躲一阵子
Get out of town for a couple of days.

797
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:31,530
为什么
Why?

798
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,660
离开这个镇子  桑迪
Get out of town, Sandy.

799
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,410
杰布在家吗
Is Jeb home?

800
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,420
我有房屋搜查令
I have a warrant to search the premises.

801
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,890
我明白了
I see.

802
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,560
如果你不介意的话
Well, if you don't mind...

803
00:58:49,060 --> 00:58:51,520
揍他  揍他  揍他
Get him! Get him! Get him!

804
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,910
让我来
I got this!

805
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,080
好的  好的
Okay, okay.

806
00:59:04,080 --> 00:59:05,660
好了
All right.

807
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:06,810
不许动
Don't move.

808
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:08,810
我帮你说吧
I'll tell you what.

809
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,140
只要我一动  你就会扣扳机
When I move, you pull the trigger.

810
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,690
-杰布在哪里  -他不在这儿
-Where's Jeb? -He's not here.

811
01:00:17,820 --> 01:00:19,110
我在那里能找到他
Where can I find him?

812
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,740
上帝啊  我的手
Jesus! My hand!

813
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,030
你不该玩枪的  我在哪里能找到他
Well, you shouldn't play with guns. Where can I find him?

814
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:26,160
你开着他的车回来的  你告诉我
You're the one driving his car. You tell...

815
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,120
我最后见到他是从拘留所出来的时候
The last I saw him, we was all leaving jail.

816
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,790
他说他必须去见个人
He said he had to see a guy.

817
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,620
-什么人  -我不知道
-What guy? Who? -I don't know.

818
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:34,130
我不知道  我发誓
I don't know, I swear.

819
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,670
我只知道他妈妈吸多了
Next I know, his mom woke up from a bender

820
01:00:36,800 --> 01:00:38,000
醒来的时候所有东西都不见了
and his shit's all gone.

821
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,460
他会这样不告而别吗
Is he the sort to light out like that?

822
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:43,090
不  不会  他从来不会丢下他的妈妈
No, no, man. He'd never leave his moms alone.

823
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,430
一定出事了
Shit ain't right.

824
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,300
-有车吗  -在外面
-Got a car? -It's outside.

825
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,560
钥匙
Keys.

826
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,350
我的手  兄弟  钥匙在我的口袋里
My hand, man. They're in my pock...

827
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,850
好的  好的
Okay, okay.

828
01:00:57,820 --> 01:00:59,360
现在看看你的朋友们
Now look at your friends.

829
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:01,190
再看着我的脸
Now look at my face.

830
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:05,200
你还想再见到我么
Do you ever want to see me again?

831
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,030
绝不
No way.

832
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,040
我偷了你的车吗
Am I stealing your car?

833
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:14,370
你想用多久就用多久
Use it as long as you like.

834
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:17,040
你真是太好了
You're very kind.

835
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,940
我认为杰布・奥利弗已经死了
I think Jeb Oliver's dead.

836
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:47,530
-杰布・奥利弗是谁  -酒吧里的家伙
-Who's Jeb Oliver? -He was the guy from the bar.

837
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,410
上帝  你怎么对他下手那么重
Jesus, how hard did you hit him?

838
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,580
什么  不  不是我
What? No, not me.

839
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,040
不  他是被谋杀的
No, he was murdered.

840
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,000
而且有人试图制造出他离开镇子的假象
And someone tried to make it look like he left town.

841
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,590
也许他只是出去一下
Well, maybe he just left town.

842
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:02,380
你出去旅游带浴帘吗
You pack your shower curtain when you travel?

843
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,630
这就是你得出结论的依据吗
Is this what you base your conclusions on?

844
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:06,550
你的头怎么了
What is that on your head?

845
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,600
你还是不知道的好
You don't want to know.

846
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,560
你在电话里说你有了新发现
You said on the phone you wanted to submit your findings.

847
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:23,720
詹姆斯・巴尔是个狙击手
James Barr was a sniper.

848
01:02:23,720 --> 01:02:25,440
既不是最好的  也不是最差的
Not the best, not the worst.

849
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:27,450
但是他不间断地训练了两年
But he trained non-stop for two years.

850
01:02:27,570 --> 01:02:28,780
这样训练目的何在
What does training like that do?

851
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,830
一般的训练能起到什么作用呢
What does any training do?

852
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:32,800
技巧变成了本能反应  肌肉记忆
Skills become reflex. Muscle memory.

853
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:33,790
射击时不假思索
You do without thinking.

854
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:37,460
同时通过灌输一些战术意识
It also makes people who aren't necessarily smart seem smart

855
01:02:37,750 --> 01:02:39,960
使一个并不聪明的人看上去很聪明
by beating some tactical awareness into them.

856
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:42,460
现在  几乎所有你父亲在巴格达找到的
Now, 99% of the evidence your father has against Barr

857
01:02:42,590 --> 01:02:44,130
对巴尔不利的证据都不能成立了
didn't exist in Baghdad,

858
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:47,170
并非巴尔聪明  而是因为他受过训练
not because Barr was smart, but because he was trained.

859
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:51,430
在那个停车场  太阳会晃到枪手的眼睛
See, from that garage, the shooter had the sun in his eyes.

860
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,000
目标左右移动
Targets were moving left and right.

861
01:02:53,000 --> 01:02:54,640
对于任何狙击手来说射击环境都很恶劣
It's difficult conditions for any sniper.

862
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:57,390
但是巴尔在巴格达杀人时就在停车场
But Baghdad, you said Barr was in a parking garage then.

863
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,190
因为那次太阳当时在他的背后
Because in Baghdad, the sun's behind him.

864
01:03:00,440 --> 01:03:03,150
目标向着他直线走来  排成一列纵队
Targets coming straight ahead, single file.

865
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,030
即使对中等水平的射手射击环境也很理想
Ideal conditions for even an average shooter

866
01:03:07,110 --> 01:03:08,820
如果想营造同等环境
and the exact same conditions

867
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,370
他会把狙击点选在高速路桥上
he would've had up on that highway bridge.

868
01:03:12,280 --> 01:03:15,490
在那里  他甚至都不需要下车
Up there, he would never even have to get out of the van.

869
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,500
没有停车计时器
No parking meter.

870
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,710
没有监控摄像头
No camera.

871
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:24,210
不会留下任何蛛丝马迹  逃脱毫无问题
No trace evidence left behind. And his escape is assured.

872
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,010
当然  我不是说他没有杀死河边那些人
Now, I'm not saying that he couldn't have killed

873
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,510
但是他不该这么杀
those people at the river, but he wouldn't have.

874
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:29,630
不应该用那种方法
Not that way.

875
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,180
-你的意思是他疯了  -不
-So you're saying he's crazy. -No.

876
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,260
你到底想说明什么呢
Well, what exactly are you saying?

877
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:35,250
如果只是单一的证据证明不了什么
Any single piece of evidence I'd buy.

878
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:37,020
但是所有的证据加起来的话
But all of it?

879
01:03:37,140 --> 01:03:39,730
纤维  指纹  遗留的弹壳  我是说
Fibres, fingerprints, stray brass, I mean...

880
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,850
他竟然还付了停车费
And who the hell pays for parking?

881
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,690
不管他的神智是清醒还是疯狂都说不通
Sane or crazy, that just doesn't make sense.

882
01:03:44,820 --> 01:03:46,440
好吧  所以巴尔他想被捕
Okay. So Barr, he wanted

883
01:03:46,440 --> 01:03:49,490
而且他想要你来逮捕他
to get caught and he wanted you to catch him.

884
01:03:50,320 --> 01:03:52,360
那也不能解释巴尔这样一个中等水平射手
That would not explain how Barr,

885
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:57,660
如何在恶劣的射击环境下能做到弹无虚发
an average shooter firing in poor conditions, never missed.

886
01:03:57,830 --> 01:03:59,000
他有失手
He did miss.

887
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:00,580
确实有
He did.

888
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:04,920
一颗完整的子弹
A pristine bullet,

889
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,340
正巧留在了液体里
conveniently trapped by a liquid backstop.

890
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,890
正是这颗子弹把巴尔的枪和谋杀联系起来
The same bullet that tied Barr's gun to the killings.

891
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:14,960
可以说是控方唯一的
And arguably the prosecution's

892
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,890
也是最重要的一件证物
single most important piece of evidence.

893
01:04:17,390 --> 01:04:20,560
如果巴尔想被逮捕  他做到了
If Barr wanted to get caught, he didn't miss.

894
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,520
不管是哪种情况  都说不通
Either way, it doesn't make sense.

895
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:25,060
如果他想逍遥法外  他很容易做到
If he wanted to get away with it, he likely would have

896
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:26,860
而如果巴尔想被逮捕
and if he wanted to get caught,

897
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:29,780
他没有能力做到这么完美
Barr was incapable of such perfection.

898
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,740
或许他只是运气好  6发全中
Or maybe he just got lucky, six shots out of six.

899
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:34,070
本来我也想接受这种观点
That's what I was willing to accept,

900
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,120
然而那些家伙来找我麻烦
then those guys took a run at me.

901
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,700
不管派他们来的人是谁  他犯了个错误
Whoever sent them made a mistake.

902
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:41,250
那不过是寻常的酒吧斗殴而已
It was just a bar fight.

903
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,710
也许吧
Maybe.

904
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:46,590
也许是有人紧张了  想让我离开
Or maybe someone got nervous, tried to run me off.

905
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:51,380
或者让我不省人事  成为下一个替罪羊
Or put me in a coma, right next to their patsy.

906
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,760
替罪羊
Patsy?

907
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,720
这是个巨大的阴谋
It was such a great crime scene.

908
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,770
没有人想到这一点因为它太完美了
No one stopped to think it might be too great.

909
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,440
爱默生想不到
Not Emerson.

910
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:05,230
你的父亲也想不到
Not your father.

911
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,940
甚至连巴尔的辩护律师也想不到
Not even Barr's own defence attorney.

912
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,280
但是巴尔知道我会想到的
But Barr knew I would,

913
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,610
无论我多么希望这就是事实
no matter how much I wanted it to be true.

914
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,330
这就是他向我求助的原因
That's why he asked for me.

915
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,290
等等
Wait.

916
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,660
你是说
Are you suggesting...

917
01:05:23,790 --> 01:05:25,960
詹姆斯・巴尔是无辜的
James Barr is innocent.

918
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,140
你已经想明白了整件事  是吗
You can see what this is, can't you?

919
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,600
你得到一个案子
You've got a case in your hands

920
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,810
这也许是你接到的最后一个案子
that may be the last case you'll ever have

921
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,770
为了不搞砸它  你会不择手段
and you'll do anything not to hit the bottom of it.

922
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,610
海伦
Helen.

923
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:51,480
知道吗  你真不该退休的
You know, you never should have retired.

924
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:53,150
听着
Just, look. Listen.

925
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,740
据我所知
For all I know, you were standing at an intersection

926
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,030
三天前你还是个无业游民
with a cardboard sign three days ago.

927
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,660
我雇了你  上帝  我父亲说得对
And I hired you. Jesus, my father was right.

928
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,830
-海伦  海伦  -现在完全说得通了
-Helen. Helen. -It makes total sense now.

929
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,700
这就是你的生存之道  四海为家
It's the way you live, the way you move around.

930
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:06,500
你与现实世界格格不入  不是吗
You're just not cut out for the real world, are you?

931
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,040
你是不是害怕自己也会步巴尔的后尘
Are you afraid you'll end up like Barr?

932
01:06:08,170 --> 01:06:09,340
-海伦  -这才是事实真相吧
-Helen. -Is that what this is?

933
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,500
看看窗外
Look out the window.

934
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:11,960
不  我还有工作要做
No, I have work to do.

935
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,340
-你必须离开了  -就迁就我一下吧
-And you need to leave. -Just humour me. Okay.

936
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,880
放开我
Let go of me.

937
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:17,840
告诉我你看到了什么  
Would you tell me what you see?

938
01:06:17,840 --> 01:06:22,140
我每天看到的都一样
I see the same things I see every day.

939
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,350
想象一下你从未见过这景色
Well, imagine you've never seen it.

940
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:28,850
想象你的一生都在世界的其他地方度过
Imagine you've spent your whole life in other parts of the world

941
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,690
每天都被告知你在捍卫自由
being told every day you're defending freedom.

942
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:34,150
最终你觉得你受够了
And finally you decide you've had enough.

943
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,230
是时候睁开眼睛看看
Time to see

944
01:06:36,230 --> 01:06:38,240
你奉献自己的一生所追求的是什么
what you've given up your whole life for.

945
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,990
也许你该为自己争取些自由
Maybe get some of that freedom for yourself.

946
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,160
看看这些人
Look at the people.

947
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,710
告诉我他们自由吗
Now tell me which ones are free.

948
01:06:49,330 --> 01:06:51,000
远离债务
Free from debt.

949
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,630
焦虑
Anxiety.

950
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:53,960
压力
Stress.

951
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,300
恐惧
Fear.

952
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:59,050
失败  侮辱  背叛
Failure. Indignity. Betrayal.

953
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,560
现在有多少人还记得他们儿时的愿望
How many wish they were born knowing what they know now?

954
01:07:04,680 --> 01:07:06,810
扪心自问  如果给他们重来一次的机会
Ask yourself how many would do things

955
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,560
有多少人会做出同样的选择
the same way all over again?

956
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:12,060
他们中有多少人会选择过我这样的生活
And how many would live their lives like me?

957
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,200
现在看着街对面那辆银色的奥迪
Now look at the silver Audi across the street,

958
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,240
它已经跟了我整整一天了
the one that's been following me all day.

959
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:21,910
这能证明什么呢
What does that prove?

960
01:07:22,030 --> 01:07:25,410
这是它的车牌号  追查需要多久
Here's the tag number. How long would it take you to run it?

961
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,000
夜里这时候  我不知道  1个小时吧
At this time of night? I don't know. An hour?

962
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,250
查一下
Do it.

963
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,540
查到了我就离开
Do it, and then I'll leave.

964
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,930
什么时候
When?

965
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:50,230
不  这个问题交给我  我来处理
No, this is my problem now. I'll handle it.

966
01:07:52,230 --> 01:07:53,310
你好
Yeah?

967
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,570
你的身份暴露了
You're blown.

968
01:07:57,070 --> 01:07:59,280
那个律师在追查你的车牌
The lawyer's running the licence plates.

969
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,110
好的  要动手吗
Yeah. So do it?

970
01:08:03,910 --> 01:08:04,950
知道了
Done.

971
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,290
去这个地址
Go to this address.

972
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:14,460
好吧  让我们假设巴尔没有杀人
All right, let's just say that Barr didn't do it.

973
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,380
或者是受人唆使去杀人的
Or did it 'cause someone put him up to it.

974
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,630
不管是哪一种  为什么要这么做
Either way, what have you got?

975
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:18,800
阴谋
Conspiracy.

976
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,670
好吧  预谋杀死5个毫不相关的人
Yeah, conspiracy to kill five random people?

977
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,050
没有动机
There's no motive.

978
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,470
-很奇怪  对吗  -可笑的阴谋论
-It's ridiculous, right? -It's grassy knoll ludicrous.

979
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,430
继续查下去毫无意义
No point looking any further.

980
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,640
完全正确
Exactly.

981
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,610
这是什么
What's this?

982
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:36,820
动机  好好地抓住它
The motive. Just hold onto it.

983
01:08:36,940 --> 01:08:38,150
我们在玩什么  线索游戏
What are we playing, Clue?

984
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,150
你好
Yeah?

985
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,820
你说吧
Give it to me.

986
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,200
谢谢
Thank you.

987
01:09:07,140 --> 01:09:09,810
你确定那辆车跟了你一整天了吗
You sure that car was following you all day?

988
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,850
从你开车来接我开始  怎么了
As soon as you picked me up. Why?

989
01:09:18,190 --> 01:09:21,940
它是乐班德尔公司名下的
It's registered to a company called Lebendauer Enterprises.

990
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,920
一场杀死5个毫不相关的人的阴谋
A conspiracy to kill five random people?

991
01:09:37,250 --> 01:09:38,750
这太奇怪了
That's ridiculous.

992
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:42,590
四个
Four.

993
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:45,930
用四个毫不相关的人
Four random people.

994
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:49,560
来掩饰一个特定的目标
To hide one specific target.

995
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:17,210
有人想得到奥赖恩・阿彻的建筑生意
Someone needed Oline Archer's construction business.

996
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,300
而奥赖恩不愿意放手
And Oline wouldn't let it go.

997
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,810
这是一个具有说服力的推论
It's a convincing theory.

998
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,480
但也仅仅是个推论
But it's just a theory.

999
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:43,260
第一枪的精准度是最差的
The first round is the least accurate.

1000
01:10:43,260 --> 01:10:45,320
狙击手称之为冷弹
The snipers call it a cold shot.

1001
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,650
同时  你的目击证人描述说
Meanwhile, your eyewitness described a pause

1002
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,070
在第一和第二枪之间有一个停顿
between the first and second rounds.

1003
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,080
这一枪杀手不慌不忙
The one shot where the killer took his time.

1004
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,910
奥赖恩・阿彻是第二个受害者
And Oline Archer was the second victim.

1005
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,830
关键的一枪
The one shot that mattered.

1006
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:02,290
但这仅仅是个推论
But it's just a theory.

1007
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:05,420
这个陷阱是专为巴尔设计的
This frame was custom made for Barr.

1008
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,180
设计者知道发生在巴格达的事
Whoever chose him knew about Baghdad

1009
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,930
而唯一能够告诉他这一切的
and the only one who could have told him about Baghdad

1010
01:11:10,010 --> 01:11:11,600
就是巴尔自己
was Barr himself.

1011
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,180
他至少有一个朋友  一个密友
He has at least one friend. A very close one.

1012
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,850
找到这个朋友  你就找到了真正的枪手
Now, you find that friend, you'll find the real shooter.

1013
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,600
找到真正的枪手  雷彻
Find the real shooter? Reacher,

1014
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:21,750
我的工作是向陪审团提出合理的疑点
my job is to present the jury with reasonable doubt.

1015
01:11:21,750 --> 01:11:22,520
到此为止
Period.

1016
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:24,110
如果我们抓住犯案的真凶呢
What about catching the guys who really did this?

1017
01:11:24,190 --> 01:11:26,280
-抓住真凶吗  -将他们绳之以法呢
-Catching the guys who did this? -Bringing them to justice?

1018
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:27,750
不  我不能把这些提交给法庭
No, I can't take this to court.

1019
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:28,450
揭露事实真相
Exposing the truth.

1020
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:30,700
即使我相信巴尔是无辜的也不行
Even if I believed Barr is innocent,

1021
01:11:30,700 --> 01:11:32,200
这不是我的工作
it's not my job.

1022
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:36,700
我只是个律师  我不是警察
I am just a lawyer. I'm not a cop.

1023
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,880
而且坦白地说  你也不是
And frankly, neither are you.

1024
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,710
这件事我帮不上忙
I can't do this any more.

1025
01:11:52,550 --> 01:11:54,390
谢谢你的咖啡  律师
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.

1026
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,380
桑迪吗
Sandy?

1027
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:36,390
等等  你是桑迪吧
Wait, it is Sandy, isn't it?

1028
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,640
我认识你吗
Do I know you?

1029
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,100
查理  我是杰布的朋友
Charlie. Jeb's friend?

1030
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,400
得了  不要让我伤心了
Oh, come on, don't break my heart.

1031
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,030
对不起  我不记得了
I'm sorry, I don't remember.

1032
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:51,950
我们当时都嗑了药  昏昏沉沉的
Well, we were both pretty wasted.

1033
01:12:55,990 --> 01:12:57,030
是的
Yeah.

1034
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:01,790
-怎么  你住在这里吗  -就在那里
-What, you live here? -Just up there.

1035
01:13:02,120 --> 01:13:03,460
不是吧
No shit.

1036
01:13:03,960 --> 01:13:07,130
我刚刚搬到后面来  真是太巧了
I just moved in around the back! How crazy is that?

1037
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:08,960
真是好极了
It's wild.

1038
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,170
是啊
Yeah.

1039
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,970
你真漂亮
Wow! You look great.

1040
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,100
谢谢
Thanks.

1041
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:21,310
你看  我不想耽误你的时间
Well, look, you know, I don't want to keep you, so...

1042
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:22,980
也许我们可以找个时间一起喝一杯
Maybe we can grab a drink sometime.

1043
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,560
也许吧
Yeah, maybe.

1044
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,400
今晚如何
Hey, how about tonight?

1045
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:30,440
我已经有约了
I'm meeting some people.

1046
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:34,150
好吧  那下次再说吧
Okay. Well, some other time, then.

1047
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:35,820
下次再说
Some other time.

1048
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:36,990
动手
Do it here.

1049
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,160
什么
What?

1050
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,700
雷彻
Reacher!

1051
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:38,720
在俄亥俄有一个靶场
There's a gun range in Ohio,

1052
01:14:38,720 --> 01:14:40,720
标靶距离超过700码
targets out to 700 yards.

1053
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,890
是唯一符合你要求的靶场
The only range that matches your requirements.

1054
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,980
你应该去睡觉
You should sleep.

1055
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:53,150
明天还要赶路呢
You have a long drive tomorrow,

1056
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,900
我要去市政厅调阅奥赖恩的司法档案
and I need to go to city hall and pull up Oline's legal history.

1057
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:00,910
我建议你别这么做  至少在我回来之前
I wouldn't do that. Not till I get back.

1058
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:04,160
如果我没猜错的话  他杀死四个不相关的人
If I'm right, someone killed four random people

1059
01:15:04,250 --> 01:15:06,410
是为了不想让人直接调查奥赖恩
so no one would look directly at Oline.

1060
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:08,050
如果我猜对了
And if I'm right,

1061
01:15:08,050 --> 01:15:10,330
你只要提到她的名字就会被杀
just saying her name could get you killed.

1062
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:13,170
-你是说我应该害怕吗  -你聪明吗
-You saying I should be scared? -Well, are you smart?

1063
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:14,710
显而易见
Obviously.

1064
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,170
那么别害怕
Then don't be scared.

1065
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,120
你要找谁
What exactly am I looking for?

1066
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:54,790
能一拳就杀了那个姑娘的人
Someone who could kill that girl with one punch.

1067
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,300
你要找的人住1109房
Oh, you want the guy in 1109.

1068
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,630
厄尼・约翰逊
Ernie Johnson.

1069
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,260
见到你就明白了
You'll see.

1070
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:30,390
下车
Out of the car!

1071
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,230
那个人是嫌疑犯  快点  跟上
That's our suspect! Move, move!

1072
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,170
嫌疑犯在65号高速公路上向北行驶
Suspect is headed north on State Route 65.

1073
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,840
我需要地面和空中支援
I need backup and air support.

1074
01:23:38,090 --> 01:23:39,430
举起手来
Hold up!

1075
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,180
安全
All clear!

1076
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:06,040
上帝啊  我简直不敢相信  不敢相信
Oh, God, I just don't believe it. I don't believe it!

1077
01:24:06,120 --> 01:24:07,790
一个小时前我申请了逮捕令
I issued the warrant an hour ago.

1078
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:09,290
通过受害者的老板我们了解到
According to the victim's boss,

1079
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:11,040
雷彻今早去过受害人工作的地方
Reacher was seen at her place of work this morning.

1080
01:24:11,290 --> 01:24:12,790
他还在那儿威胁过受害者的老板
Where he threatened her boss.

1081
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:13,860
他今晚开的车
The car he was driving

1082
01:24:13,860 --> 01:24:15,880
是杰布・奥利弗一个朋友的
tonight belonged to a friend of Jeb Oliver's.

1083
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,130
他打了那个人
The man he assaulted.

1084
01:24:17,300 --> 01:24:18,970
不  是那些人袭击了雷彻
No, those guys assaulted Reacher.

1085
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:20,930
雷彻今天下午开着杰布・奥利弗的车
Reacher put three more men in the hospital

1086
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:22,470
去了杰布・奥利弗家里
this afternoon at Jeb Oliver's place.

1087
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:24,720
之后把三个人送进医院
After arriving in Jeb Oliver's car.

1088
01:24:24,810 --> 01:24:26,970
而且他离开医院之后杰布就失踪了
And Jeb hasn't been seen since he left the hospital.

1089
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,000
海伦  如果你知道雷彻在哪里
Helen, if you know where Reacher is,

1090
01:24:29,000 --> 01:24:29,730
你必须告诉我们
you need to tell us.

1091
01:24:29,810 --> 01:24:31,350
我不知道他在哪里  几个小时之前
I don't know where he is. I have not seen him

1092
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,900
他离开我的办公室  之后我再没见过他
since he left my office a few hours ago.

1093
01:24:35,980 --> 01:24:36,980
我觉得她说的是实话
I think she's telling the truth.

1094
01:24:36,980 --> 01:24:38,480
你觉得  爸爸  去你的
You think, Dad? Fuck you!

1095
01:24:38,820 --> 01:24:40,820
我告诉过你不要接近他
Hey, I told you not to go near him.

1096
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,320
你们冲进我家还把我当成胁从犯来对待
You come into my home and you treat me like I'm an accessory!

1097
01:24:43,410 --> 01:24:45,490
-拜托  -好吧  得了  别吵了
-Please! You know... -All right. All right. Come on. Enough.

1098
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,660
-让我来处理  -我还没问完呢
-Look, let me handle it. -I'm not done.

1099
01:24:46,830 --> 01:24:47,990
问话时间结束  给我出去
You're both done. Just get out.

1100
01:24:53,500 --> 01:24:54,750
我是海伦
This is Helen.

1101
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,420
-我猜警察现在就在你那儿  -是的
-I'm guessing the police are there? -Yep.

1102
01:24:57,500 --> 01:24:59,630
看你的反应我猜在你把电话交给他们前
By your response I'm guessing I have about 30 seconds

1103
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,920
我只有大概30秒的时间
before you hand them the phone.

1104
01:25:01,010 --> 01:25:02,340
如果是那样的话
If that.

1105
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,300
如果你相信有人能陷害巴尔
If you believe someone could frame Barr,

1106
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,760
你得相信他们同样也可以陷害我
you have to believe they could do the same to me.

1107
01:25:06,850 --> 01:25:08,560
我相信这很有可能
I suppose that's possible.

1108
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:11,770
她是个可爱的孩子  海伦
She was a sweet kid, Helen.

1109
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,940
因为我的原因他们杀了她
And they killed her because of me.

1110
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:17,940
他们想让我离开
They want me to run.

1111
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,070
但是我不会这么做
But I won't.

1112
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:21,700
我要查完这件案子
I'm going to finish this.

1113
01:25:21,700 --> 01:25:23,030
这可不是个好主意
No, that's not a good idea.

1114
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,200
听着
Listen.

1115
01:25:24,360 --> 01:25:27,410
两件事  第一
Two things. One, I...

1116
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,910
我偷了你的车
I stole your car.

1117
01:25:30,870 --> 01:25:32,580
如果你想撇清关系
If you want to end this,

1118
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,040
只要打个电话报失车辆就行了
just hang up the phone and report it missing.

1119
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,290
我能理解
And I'll understand.

1120
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,790
还有呢
And anything else?

1121
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:39,670
如果我早点告诉你或许还有转机
I thought I'd be pushing it if I mentioned this earlier.

1122
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,630
现在说也于事无补
Now I guess all bets are off.

1123
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:44,880
你回想一下对爱默生和你父亲都说了什么
You need to watch what you say to Emerson and your father.

1124
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,550
我认为他们之中的一个与案件有牵连
I think one of them is in on it.

1125
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,970
好的  谢谢你打来电话  我得挂了
All right. Thanks for calling. I have to go.

1126
01:25:49,060 --> 01:25:51,140
等等  我从第一天起就被人跟踪
Wait. I've been followed from day one.

1127
01:25:53,060 --> 01:25:54,730
只有三个人知道我在这儿
Only three people knew I was here.

1128
01:25:54,900 --> 01:25:57,150
爱默生  你的父亲和你
Emerson, your father and you.

1129
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:00,020
扪心自问  如果我们为巴尔洗脱罪名
You need to ask yourself,

1130
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:01,940
谁的损失最大
who has the most to lose if we clear Barr?

1131
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:06,320
谁曾经告诫你要离我远点
Who tried to warn you off me?

1132
01:26:07,830 --> 01:26:10,330
当然  也可能是我错了
Of course, I could be wrong. If you think I am,

1133
01:26:10,410 --> 01:26:12,080
如果你也这样认为  把电话交给警察
just hand over the phone.

1134
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,660
你没有必要牵扯进来
There's no sense getting any deeper.

1135
01:26:14,920 --> 01:26:16,120
你在和谁通电话
Who's that you're talking to?

1136
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:18,580
办公室
The office.

1137
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,760
你们问完了吗
Are we done?

1138
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,090
海伦  听着
Helen, listen.

1139
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:26,630
-我们得  -晚安
-We need to... -Good night.

1140
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,920
你这里有不少优秀的射手
You got some fine shooters here.

1141
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:48,590
他们就像绝世美女
Fine as frog's hair.

1142
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,260
十分稀有
Rarer, too.

1143
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:54,010
因为打靶场里很多人连一环都打不中
'Cause most of them fellas out there can't shoot worth a damn.

1144
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,270
你要他们三枪都射中黑环
You ask them to put three rounds in the black, well,

1145
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,600
根本不可能
they'll suck it.

1146
01:28:03,020 --> 01:28:03,820
我想找这个靶场的主人
I'm looking for the owner.

1147
01:28:03,820 --> 01:28:06,360
我就是  我叫马丁・凯希
That'd be me. Martin Cash.

1148
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:08,110
艾伦・沃德
Aaron Ward.

1149
01:28:08,360 --> 01:28:10,360
有什么能为你效劳吗  沃德先生
What can I do you for, Mr Ward? Ward?

1150
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:11,690
我在找一个朋友
Yeah. I'm looking for a friend of mine.

1151
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:13,990
我们曾一起在伊拉克服役
We served in Iraq.

1152
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,700
他这个人很不受人待见  你明白吗
The guy just dropped off the grid, you know?

1153
01:28:16,040 --> 01:28:17,870
-我明白  是的  -是啊  是啊
-It happens. Yep. -Yeah. Yeah.

1154
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,250
总之  他是个射手
Anyway, he was a shooter.

1155
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:20,960
最近我听说  他住在这里附近
Last I heard, he lived around here somewhere and I...

1156
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,040
他什么时候退役的
When did he get out of the Army?

1157
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,300
我可没说是在军队
Well, I didn't say the Army.

1158
01:28:26,380 --> 01:28:29,380
你说你和他一起服役  你又没留锅盖头
Well, you said you served with him. You're no jarhead.

1159
01:28:28,380 --> 01:28:30,380
"锅盖头"是对美国海军陆战队士兵的谐称

1160
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:32,130
明眼人都看得出来
Man on a flying horse could see that.

1161
01:28:32,220 --> 01:28:34,390
我爸爸参过军  这算不算
Well, my father was in the Corps, if that helps.

1162
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,470
那你只能算半个男人
Well, that makes you half human.

1163
01:28:39,060 --> 01:28:40,270
你朋友叫什么名字
Your friend got a name?

1164
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:42,560
詹姆斯・巴尔
Yeah. James Barr.

1165
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:45,150
詹姆斯・巴尔
James Barr.

1166
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,070
从来没有听说过这个人
Never heard of him.

1167
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:49,900
我认为你见过
I think you have.

1168
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:52,990
警察进来追问他的时候
I think you've been dreading

1169
01:28:53,070 --> 01:28:55,160
你肯定怕得要死吧
the moment some cop comes in here asking after him.

1170
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:58,160
因为这附近的某个足球妈妈
Because it's for sure some soccer mom around here

1171
01:28:55,510 --> 01:28:58,160
足球妈妈:非常重视子女的妈妈  这里代指警察

1172
01:28:58,250 --> 01:28:59,770
肯定更担心你的射击场
is more worried about your range

1173
01:28:59,770 --> 01:29:02,580
而不是她后院的游泳池
than she is about the pool in her backyard

1174
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:05,250
或者水槽下的疏通器
or the drain cleaner under her sink.

1175
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:10,170
她才不管巴尔能否在100英里外击中
Wouldn't matter to her if Barr did his killing 100 miles away,

1176
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,130
只要他来这里练习过
only that he came here to rehearse.

1177
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:13,800
她随便就能找个理由把这儿关了
She'd have a case to shut you down

1178
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,850
而你只能束手无策
and nothing better to do.

1179
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:18,850
你想怎么样
What do you want?

1180
01:29:20,430 --> 01:29:22,270
我想知道巴尔的朋友是谁
I want to know who Barr's friends were.

1181
01:29:26,440 --> 01:29:27,610
那些来这里练手的哥们
Those boys out there,

1182
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,610
对涉及到他们利益的事都特别敏感
they're mighty touchy when it comes to their constitutional rights.

1183
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:33,310
假如我告诉他们
Suppose I tell them

1184
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:35,870
有个警察在这问我会员的事  会有什么结果
a cop is in here asking after my members?

1185
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,950
-我不是警察  -那你是什么人
-I'm not a cop. -What are you?

1186
01:29:38,040 --> 01:29:39,120
我替巴尔的律师工作
I work for Barr's attorney.

1187
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,040
我们有理由相信他是无辜的
We have reason to believe he's innocent.

1188
01:29:41,120 --> 01:29:42,250
你就胡扯吧
The hell you say.

1189
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:44,030
你爱信不信
Be that as it may

1190
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:47,040
我是唯一一个愿意找到这儿来的人
I'm the only one who's bothered to track him this far.

1191
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:51,800
你帮我一把  我就欠你一个人情
You help me out, I'll be in your debt.

1192
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,300
我要是不帮呢
And if I don't?

1193
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,300
那就等着警察来找你吧
Maybe you can coach soccer.

1194
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:05,060
你击中三次靶心再说吧
You put three in the centre and maybe we'll talk.

1195
01:30:07,810 --> 01:30:09,150
我能练练手吗
Can I have a few to warm up?

1196
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:34,940
偏了六英寸
Six inches right.

1197
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,990
沃德先生  你水平就这样吗  好好打
That's your mulligan, Mr Ward. Play ball!

1198
01:31:39,910 --> 01:31:41,240
开始吧
Let's go.

1199
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,790
你有点生疏了 雷彻先生
You're a little rusty, Mr Reacher.

1200
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:33,830
我在温布尔登杯上看到过雷彻先生射击
I saw a man by that name shoot for the Wimbledon Cup,

1201
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,540
大概是十年前
what, ten years ago.

1202
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:39,010
我也非常肯定你从来没当过洋基队的第二球手
And I'm pretty sure you never played second base for the Yankees

1203
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,220
在1925年的时候
in 1925.

1204
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:43,720
好了
Now,

1205
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,220
我可以回答一个问题
I'll answer one question.

1206
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:48,640
你这里射击最好的是谁
Who's your best shooter?

1207
01:32:50,140 --> 01:32:51,390
詹姆斯・巴尔
James Barr.

1208
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,650
我一听说枪击案就把这些都摘下来了
I pulled all these down as soon as I heard about the shooting.

1209
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:06,910
这是我这辈子见过枪法最好的
That's the best shot I ever seen this side of civilian life.

1210
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:09,410
要是我说巴尔
Suppose I told you Barr

1211
01:33:09,410 --> 01:33:12,330
在服役时的最佳水平也打不到这样呢
wasn't this good on his best day in the Army.

1212
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:14,090
靶子都是我亲手挂上去的
I handed out those targets myself.

1213
01:33:14,090 --> 01:33:15,500
这是我给每个人做的记号
That's my scrawl on every one.

1214
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,590
你是按射向挂上去的吗
Do you hang them downrange, too?

1215
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,590
你开玩笑吧
What, are you serious?

1216
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:23,090
我是说很有可能巴尔有位朋友
I'm saying it's possible that Barr had a friend.

1217
01:33:23,510 --> 01:33:25,090
他在射击场上调换了靶子
One who switched the targets on the range.

1218
01:33:25,180 --> 01:33:26,510
也许还是巴尔允许的
Maybe Barr let him.

1219
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:29,930
也许他觉得把名字挂到你的墙上很了不起
Made him feel like King Shit having his name up on your wall.

1220
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:31,380
我从没见过任何一位枪手
I never saw one real shooter

1221
01:33:31,380 --> 01:33:34,440
甚至愿意跟他妈妈换靶的
who would do that for his own mother.

1222
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:38,940
除非他想要陷害他妈妈犯了多宗谋杀
Unless he was framing his mother for multiple murder

1223
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,110
并且利用你的射击场达到这一点
and using your range to do it.

1224
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:47,570
巴尔不是一个人来的  对吗
Barr didn't come alone, did he?

1225
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:51,520
这些疯子可能会杀了你
You know, one of these nuts is likely to kill you,

1226
01:33:51,520 --> 01:33:52,750
要是他们发现你装了监控器
they find that camera, there.

1227
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,000
靠  我装监控器
Hell, the camera's there

1228
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,420
就是怕哪个疯子要杀我
'cause one of these nuts is likely to kill me.

1229
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,590
那就是巴尔
There's Barr.

1230
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:02,880
我一直很喜欢他  一直很喜欢
I always liked him. Always liked him.

1231
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,050
停
There.

1232
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:06,260
就是他
Him.

1233
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,720
那个狗崽子
That son of a bitch.

1234
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:19,150
我是海伦・罗丁
Helen Rodin speaking.

1235
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:20,940
找到了枪杀案的嫌疑人
Got a candidate for our shooter.

1236
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:23,490
有录像  可能有指纹
Picture, possible prints

1237
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:25,990
还有一位讨厌的目击者
and one pissed-off eyewitness.

1238
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,740
我现在不方便讲话
I can't talk right now.

1239
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,330
给我三个小时  等我回来
Just give me three hours to get back.

1240
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:32,490
我到之前不要见任何人
And don't talk to anyone until I get there.

1241
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:34,460
我会等的  谢谢
I'll look into that, thanks.

1242
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:38,170
这是我今天早上能找到的
This is just what I could pull this morning.

1243
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:42,420
税务记录  市级和州级许可证申请  投标合同
Tax records, city and state permit applications, contract bids.

1244
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,210
乔治亚州的空壳公司
Shell corporation in Georgia.

1245
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:46,680
这个是在俄国之后  而不是佛罗里达州
That's the one next to Russia, not Florida.

1246
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:49,080
他们每次只在一个城市做事
They work one city at a time,

1247
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:51,180
引起人们对当地建筑的关注
acquiring a local construction concern

1248
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:53,310
刚好是在大型项目重建前夕
just ahead of major civic redevelopment.

1249
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:57,190
他们建造毫无用处的桥  毫无用处的公路
They build bridges no one needs. Highways no one uses.

1250
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:02,020
他们就像是癌症  一个不停生长的细胞
They're like a cancer. A cell that won't stop growing.

1251
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:05,710
15年间他们换了12个地方
They moved 12 times in 15 years.

1252
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:07,200
亚特兰大  阿尔伯克基
Atlanta, Albuquerque,

1253
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:10,160
奥斯丁市  俄克拉荷马市  萨克拉门托
Austin, Oklahoma City, Sacramento.

1254
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:13,370
总是被指控贪污
Always amidst allegations of corruption

1255
01:35:13,500 --> 01:35:16,960
包括数百万美元公款的失踪
including millions of dollars in missing public funds.

1256
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:21,380
但是从来没遭受过调查  连传讯都没有
And yet never an investigation. Never even an inquiry.

1257
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:25,550
乐班德尔公司就像是无疵可寻
It's as if Lebendauer Enterprises were above reproach.

1258
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:32,140
可能这是因为
Well, maybe that's because

1259
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,020
对他们的控告都来自竞争对手
the allegations come from the competition.

1260
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:39,020
竞标失败了  心里不舒服
Outbid. Bitter.

1261
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,060
比如说奥赖恩・阿彻
Like Oline Archer.

1262
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,980
也可能是乐班德尔买通了一些重要官员呢
Or maybe Lebendauer has the cooperation of key officials.

1263
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:48,030
也许买通的这些还不管用
And maybe when that cooperation isn't enough,

1264
01:35:48,410 --> 01:35:51,660
所以就杀了收买不到的人  比如奥赖恩・阿彻
they kill people who won't be bought off. Like Oline Archer.

1265
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:53,910
海伦  这些东西你真的相信吗
Helen, how much of this do you honestly believe?

1266
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,200
我信不信不重要
It doesn't matter how much I believe.

1267
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:58,830
甚至我能不能证实也不重要
It doesn't even matter how much I can prove.

1268
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,420
唯一重要的是有多少是真的
It only matters how much is true.

1269
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:03,710
你知道自己听起来有多可笑吗
Do you know how delusional you sound?

1270
01:36:04,210 --> 01:36:05,880
你怎么回事
What happened to you?

1271
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:09,690
你就这么想要这个人死掉
Are you really so set on putting this man to death

1272
01:36:09,690 --> 01:36:10,430
甚至不顾
that you'd ignore...

1273
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:24,940
我以自己的名义找了这些资料
I pulled all of this paper under my own name.

1274
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:27,780
如果杰克・雷彻是对的
If Jack Reacher's right,

1275
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,610
我的性命  你女儿的性命
my life, your daughter's life,

1276
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,120
现在岌岌可危
is in danger now.

1277
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,790
我的命运全由你决定
Whatever happens to me next is on your head,

1278
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,210
无论是不是与你有关
whether you're involved or not.

1279
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:44,180
你是地区检察官
You are the District Attorney

1280
01:36:44,180 --> 01:36:47,050
我也向你提供了有力证据
and I've given you compelling evidence

1281
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:49,050
来调查乐班德尔公司
to investigate Lebendauer Enterprises.

1282
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:53,300
你的下一步会告诉我你到底站在哪边
Your next move will tell me which side you're on.

1283
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:57,600
我明白了  这是个考验
I see. It's a test.

1284
01:36:58,770 --> 01:37:03,650
你可能很难相信  不过我是爱你的
Well, this may be hard for you to believe, but I do love you.

1285
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:08,150
很显然我也不能置之不理
And obviously I'm not going to turn a blind eye,

1286
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,650
尽管我觉得这简直荒唐透顶
no matter how absurd I find all of this.

1287
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:15,620
所以  如果你真的觉得自己受到了威胁
So, if you really believe that you're in danger,

1288
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:17,490
如果你真这么想的话
if you believe that,

1289
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:20,950
那我的下一步
then the next order of business,

1290
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,170
就是立刻将你保护性拘留
is to put you in protective custody right now.

1291
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,260
如果你真的被收买了  我又能有多安全
And how safe will I be if you're part of it?

1292
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:32,300
天哪  海伦
Jesus, Helen.

1293
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,030
开会吗  还是私事
Business meeting or personal?

1294
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,240
两者都有
Hard to tell them apart.

1295
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:39,070
我想也是
I'll bet.

1296
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:42,300
海伦吗
Helen?

1297
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,560
不是
No.

1298
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:46,600
对不起打错了
Sorry, wrong number.

1299
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:48,560
你是雷彻吗
Is this Reacher?

1300
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:52,060
你是谁
Who is this?

1301
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,610
你是雷彻吗
Is this Reacher?

1302
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:05,580
是你  跟踪我的那个人
It's you. The guy from the car.

1303
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,290
你男朋友打来的
It's your boyfriend.

1304
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,460
雷彻  是你吗
Reacher, is it you?

1305
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:15,090
海伦  你受伤了吗
Helen, are you hurt?

1306
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,260
如果你不在一小时内过来的话她就会受伤
Well, she's gonna be if you're not here in one hour.

1307
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:20,130
要我告诉你怎么做吗
Do I have to tell you how this works?

1308
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:22,050
你们会让我绕几圈确认没人跟着
You'll bounce me around to make sure I'm not followed,

1309
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:24,600
然后走进你们的陷阱再杀了我
then walk me into an ambush and kill me.

1310
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,970
你把惊喜都毁了
Aw, you ruined my surprise.

1311
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:28,930
我有个更好的办法
Well, I can do one better.

1312
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,650
我去了亨吉溪镇的射击场
I went down to the gun range at Hinge Creek.

1313
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:34,090
我拿到了录像  指纹
I got the picture, prints,

1314
01:40:34,090 --> 01:40:35,610
我会去找联邦政府的人
and I'm going to the Feds.

1315
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,440
那个律师随你处置
The lawyer's all yours.

1316
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:42,990
把柴克找来
Get the Zec.

1317
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:54,500
我又想了一下  还是把你杀了好
On second thought, I'd like to kill you.

1318
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:56,210
那我们就胜者全得吧
Let's say winner take all.

1319
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,340
听着  臭小子
Listen to me, you prick.

1320
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,130
如果你一小时之内不来的话我就把这个婊子杀
I will kill this bitch if you're not here in one...

1321
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:02,130
妈的
Shit!

1322
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,140
你以为我是个英雄吗
You think I'm a hero?

1323
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:14,190
我不是英雄  我是个一无所有的流浪者
I am not a hero. I'm a drifter with nothing to lose.

1324
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,360
如果你杀了那姑娘来陷害我
You killed that girl to put me in a frame.

1325
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:21,490
我扒光你的皮
I mean to beat you to death and drink your blood from a boot.

1326
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:24,310
听着  按我说的做
Now, this is how it's going to work.

1327
01:41:24,310 --> 01:41:26,030
你把地址给我
You're gonna give me the address

1328
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,620
我他妈什么时候准备好了就过来
and I'll be along when I am damn good and ready.

1329
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,950
如果我打过来不是她接的
If she doesn't answer the phone when I call this number,

1330
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,870
只要我觉得她受伤了
if I even think you've hurt her,

1331
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:34,710
我会立刻消失
I disappear.

1332
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:37,480
如果你够聪明的话  我不是威胁你
And if you're smart, that scares you,

1333
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:39,630
你们在明我在暗
because I'm in your blind spot

1334
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:41,840
而且我没什么别的可做
and I have nothing better to do.

1335
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:51,100
你有笔吗
You got a pen?

1336
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:54,560
不需要
Don't need one.

1337
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:00,770
要是每次被大兵找来帮忙
If I had a dollar for every

1338
01:43:00,780 --> 01:43:03,460
我都收一美元就好了
time the Army called the Corps for help.

1339
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,630
-给我带家伙了吗  -带了
-You have something for me? -Yeah.

1340
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:09,760
给你
Here.

1341
01:43:14,270 --> 01:43:15,310
你在开玩笑吧
You're kidding, right?

1342
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:16,890
我十年前看过你射击
Just because I saw you shoot ten years ago

1343
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:20,440
并不代表我就允许你用我的枪杀人
doesn't mean I'll let you kill some asshole with my gun.

1344
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:22,320
我说了这事很严重
I told you how serious this was.

1345
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:24,320
我也来了  对吧
And I showed up, didn't I?

1346
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:26,320
那就开始吧
So let's get to it.

1347
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:29,320
你的对手应该
Now, your shooter will be

1348
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:32,910
就在这些灯后  明白吗
right up there behind those lights. Okay?

1349
01:43:32,990 --> 01:43:35,950
他能看到来去两边的所有情况
He can cover both roads coming and going.

1350
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,830
你一站起来就能将你击中
And kill you just as soon as you stand up.

1351
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,130
那你能把他引出来吗
Well, can you take him out?

1352
01:43:41,670 --> 01:43:42,960
共进晚餐吗
What, to dinner you mean?

1353
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:46,590
听着  我不知道你平时
Look, I don't know the type

1354
01:43:46,590 --> 01:43:49,340
都跟什么人打交道  雷彻
of people you normally associate with, Reacher.

1355
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:51,500
不过我不习惯
But I'm not in the habit of

1356
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:54,680
你一声令下就开车到郊外
driving out to the boonies at the drop of a hat

1357
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:58,480
然后随便放倒一些陌生人好吗
and just picking off some total strangers, all right?

1358
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:01,030
总之  我什么都看不到
Anyway, I can't see anything,

1359
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:02,190
这些灯亮着就看不到
not with them lights up.

1360
01:44:02,320 --> 01:44:03,860
那把它们打灭
So shoot them out.

1361
01:44:04,650 --> 01:44:07,360
当然好  这样他们就知道我的位置了
Yeah, sure. And then he knows right where I am.

1362
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:09,490
我还不如引火自焚呢
I might as well set myself on fire.

1363
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:13,370
不对  先生  他们开枪了我再开枪
No, sir. I'll start shooting when he does.

1364
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:18,160
那你说怎么让他们先开枪
And how do you propose we get him started?

1365
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:22,540
你可以开跑啊
Well, you could always start running.

1366
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:31,550
你眼睛怎么了
What's wrong with your eye?

1367
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,350
我在保留夜视能力
I'm saving my night vision.

1368
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:40,560
神枪手  你介不介意我问你个私人问题
Hey, Gunny, you mind if I ask you kind of a personal question?

1369
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:42,520
怎么  你觉得我不会射击了吗
What, you don't think I can shoot any more?

1370
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:44,860
这技能不练就没了
It is a perishable skill.

1371
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:47,070
对  没错
Yeah, well,

1372
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:49,740
还有一小时太阳就出来了
the sun will be up in an hour.

1373
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:52,570
我们动手吧
Let's get going.

1374
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:11,760
我听到他们管你叫柴克
I heard them call you the Zec.

1375
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:13,890
意思是囚犯
That means "Prisoner."

1376
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:16,930
对吗
Yes?

1377
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:21,270
告诉我  你杀了这么多人
Tell me, killing all those people,

1378
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:23,520
我只能认为你挣的钱
I have to believe the money you're making

1379
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,020
不可能足够
can't possibly be enough to just...

1380
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:26,360
足够
Enough?

1381
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:28,440
对我来说没这回事
There is no such thing.

1382
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:30,780
能拿的我们都会拿走
We take what can be taken.

1383
01:45:31,110 --> 01:45:32,610
这是我们的本职
This is what we do.

1384
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,450
那你呢
And you?

1385
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:40,700
这人这么做我能理解  但是你呢
This one I think I understand, but you?

1386
01:45:41,370 --> 01:45:42,460
你为什么这么做
Why'd you do it?

1387
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:45,130
你说的好像我能有选择一样
You make it sound like I had a choice.

1388
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:46,460
难道没有吗
Oh, didn't you?

1389
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:51,300
你会明白的
You'll see.

1390
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:57,310
你应该知道我已经采取了行动
You should know I've taken steps,

1391
01:45:57,310 --> 01:45:58,470
如果发生了任何事
that if anything happens...

1392
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:00,100
如果你发生什么事
If anything happens to you,

1393
01:46:00,100 --> 01:46:02,270
那也是在你父亲眼前
it will happen in front of your father

1394
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:04,440
他会求我手下留情
while he begs for your life.

1395
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:08,980
你不该把他也搅进来
You should never have involved him.

1396
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:12,990
现在你必须得说服他忘了这事  为了你
Now you will have to convince him to forget, for your sake

1397
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:15,320
也为了他自己
and for his.

1398
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:19,910
你什么都没说  但是我从你眼里看到了不屑
You say nothing, but I see defiance in your eyes.

1399
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:23,500
这个眼神我看到过太多太多次了
That is a look I have seen many, many times.

1400
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:26,170
那个大兵过来的时候
When the soldier comes,

1401
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:28,670
当你看到他怎么死时  你就不是这个眼神了
when you watch how he dies, it will change you.

1402
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:31,340
那时候你就会巴不得忘掉我
You will want to forget me then.

1403
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:43,430
雷彻
Reacher?

1404
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,850
你还好吗
Are you okay?

1405
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,310
他们已经做好准备等着你了
They're ready for you.

1406
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:48,860
他们自以为准备好了
They'd like to think so.

1407
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:52,360
别过来  求你别过来  我不值得
Don't do this. Please don't do this. Not for me.

1408
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,030
听着  海伦
Listen, Helen

1409
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:56,570
他们抓到我之前是不会伤害你的
They're not gonna hurt you until they have me.

1410
01:46:56,570 --> 01:46:58,160
但是他们不会抓到的
And that's never going to happen.

1411
01:46:58,370 --> 01:46:59,530
听清楚了吗
You hear me?

1412
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,700
你坚持住
You just hang in there.

1413
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,370
我马上来救你了
'Cause I'm coming to get you.

1414
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:08,460
快说你相信我
Now say you believe me.

1415
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:11,340
我相信你
I believe you.

1416
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,040
这主意太烂了
This was a bad idea.

1417
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:05,560
快点啊  神枪手
Any time now, Gunny.

1418
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:22,200
妈的
Shit.

1419
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,420
你他妈在哪呢  神枪手
Where the hell are you, Gunny?

1420
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:55,390
去死吧
Suck it!

1421
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:08,070
您该走了
You should go.

1422
01:53:51,280 --> 01:53:52,610
把枪放下
Toss it.

1423
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,130
我知道你在里边  爱默生
I know you're in there, Emerson.

1424
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,630
有一件事我忽视了
It was staring me right in the face.

1425
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:04,800
唯一不合理的那一点
The one piece that just didn't fit.

1426
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,100
那枚硬币
The quarter.

1427
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:12,400
没人会想到去搜停车计时器
Nobody would have thought to dump that meter.

1428
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:15,650
连我也想不到
Not even me.

1429
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:01,150
你冤枉我父亲了
You were wrong about my father.

1430
01:58:03,160 --> 01:58:05,240
我不会扩大声势的
I wouldn't make a big thing of it.

1431
01:58:22,590 --> 01:58:23,800
他是谁
Who is he?

1432
01:58:23,930 --> 01:58:25,510
那是神秘的二号人物
That's John Doe Number Two.

1433
01:58:25,680 --> 01:58:28,850
整场阴谋的策划者
The man on the grassy knoll. The thing under the bed.

1434
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:31,680
人们称他为柴克
They call him the Zec.

1435
01:58:31,930 --> 01:58:34,190
柴克  囚犯
Zec? Prisoner.

1436
01:58:35,270 --> 01:58:36,690
你真名叫什么
What's your real name?

1437
01:58:39,860 --> 01:58:41,610
我出生在十月
I was born in October.

1438
01:58:41,690 --> 01:58:44,030
我数到十  就扣动扳机
When I get to my birthday, I'm gonna pull the trigger.

1439
01:58:44,360 --> 01:58:46,280
一  二
One. Two.

1440
01:58:46,360 --> 01:58:49,950
车罗维克  柴克・车罗维克
Chelovek. Zec Chelovek.

1441
01:58:51,700 --> 01:58:53,200
车罗维克
Chelovek?

1442
01:58:53,870 --> 01:58:55,370
车罗维克  人类
Chelovek? Human.

1443
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:58,920
囚犯人类
Prisoner Human Being.

1444
01:59:00,050 --> 01:59:03,380
-这是你真名  -我只记得这么多
-That's your real name? -That is all I remember.

1445
01:59:06,550 --> 01:59:07,970
快报警
Call the police.

1446
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:13,310
你刚才真打算开枪吗
Were you really going to shoot him?

1447
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:16,890
我知道我不需要开枪
I knew I wouldn't have to.

1448
01:59:17,980 --> 01:59:19,210
只要看看这个人
One look at this guy

1449
01:59:19,210 --> 01:59:21,860
就知道他会不计一切代价地活下去
and you know he'll do anything to survive.

1450
01:59:22,230 --> 01:59:24,400
只要看看我就知道我不是在虚张声势
One look at me and you know I'm not bluffing.

1451
01:59:24,650 --> 01:59:27,150
对  这边有紧急状况
Yes, I have an emergency at...

1452
01:59:28,070 --> 01:59:29,320
好的  我稍等一下
Yes, I'll hold.

1453
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:34,410
我们不着急
We're in no hurry.

1454
01:59:37,000 --> 01:59:39,210
您名叫囚犯  现在应该觉得回到家里了
With a name like yours, you're gonna feel right at home.

1455
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:42,250
进监狱  在美国吗
Prison? In America?

1456
01:59:42,750 --> 01:59:46,920
是养老院吧  如果我真要进的话
A retirement home. If I go to prison at all.

1457
01:59:47,010 --> 01:59:48,180
你觉得自己逃得掉吗
You think you're gonna walk?

1458
01:59:48,430 --> 01:59:50,120
你是一个无家可归的流浪人
You are a homeless drifter

1459
01:59:50,130 --> 01:59:51,100
被控谋杀的通缉犯
wanted for murder.

1460
01:59:51,430 --> 01:59:52,180
而我
Meanwhile,

1461
01:59:52,180 --> 01:59:55,770
是一个在错误时间到了错误地点的老人
I am an old man in the wrong place at the wrong time.

1462
01:59:56,100 --> 02:00:00,190
多亏了你呀  还会有别的结果
Thanks to you, who is left to say otherwise? Who?

1463
02:00:00,270 --> 02:00:04,110
是的  您好  对  我这边有个紧急情况
Yes, hello? Yes, there's... I have an emergency.

1464
02:00:04,190 --> 02:00:06,240
我们就等着看到底谁进监狱吧
We'll see which one of us goes to prison.

1465
02:00:06,440 --> 02:00:08,950
外面大概死了三四人
There are maybe three, four people dead.

1466
02:00:09,490 --> 02:00:10,950
好吧
Okay.

1467
02:00:11,520 --> 02:00:14,600
猜我怎么说  都不进
My bet? Neither one.

1468
02:00:18,120 --> 02:00:19,670
你干嘛了
What did you do?

1469
02:00:24,130 --> 02:00:25,670
看不出来吗
What's it look like?

1470
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:28,470
那真相怎么办
What about the truth?

1471
02:00:28,970 --> 02:00:31,390
这些真凶怎么办呢
What about getting the guys who really did this?

1472
02:00:31,470 --> 02:00:33,470
不将他绳之于法吗
What about bringing him to justice?

1473
02:00:34,640 --> 02:00:36,220
已经绳之于法了
I just did.

1474
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:46,900
那怎么为巴尔洗脱罪名呢  还有你
What about clearing Barr? What about clearing you?

1475
02:00:47,150 --> 02:00:48,740
我相信你能办到的
I have faith you'll sort it out.

1476
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:50,650
我听说你很受当地检察官的青睐
And I hear you have an in with the local D.A.

1477
02:00:50,740 --> 02:00:52,990
那你现在怎么办呢
But what happens to you in the meantime?

1478
02:00:53,120 --> 02:00:54,990
继续流浪  跟以前一样
I keep moving. Same as always.

1479
02:00:55,080 --> 02:00:57,240
等一下  那是我的车吗
Wait, is that my car?

1480
02:01:04,250 --> 02:01:05,290
这就是那位女士
This the lady?

1481
02:01:06,170 --> 02:01:08,340
海伦・罗丁  马丁・凯希
Helen Rodin, Martin Cash.

1482
02:01:08,670 --> 02:01:09,760
幸会
A pleasure.

1483
02:01:11,180 --> 02:01:13,340
你看起来真糟啊  大兵
You look like hell there, Army.

1484
02:01:13,430 --> 02:01:16,620
你刚刚问我怕不怕像巴尔一样的下场
You asked if I was afraid I'd end up like Barr.

1485
02:01:16,620 --> 02:01:17,300
我不怕
I'm not.

1486
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:19,180
我怕变成他那个样子
I'm afraid I'll end up like this guy.

1487
02:01:19,270 --> 02:01:22,100
那边死了很多人  我们动身吧
There's a lot of dead bodies out here. So let's get to it.

1488
02:01:22,190 --> 02:01:25,020
-我们该走了  -等等  就这样吗
-We should probably go. -Wait. That's it?

1489
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,650
就这么结束了吗
It's just over?

1490
02:01:27,780 --> 02:01:29,490
你会没事的  律师小姐
You'll be all right, counsellor.

1491
02:01:29,690 --> 02:01:32,360
不  如果我需要你怎么办  我怎么找到你
No. What if I need you? How will I find you?

1492
02:01:32,610 --> 02:01:33,860
你不需要我
You don't need me.

1493
02:01:35,450 --> 02:01:36,780
不再需要了
Not any more.

1494
02:01:39,370 --> 02:01:40,700
留下她电话  我们走吧
Get her number. Let's go!

1495
02:01:57,220 --> 02:01:59,220
我是海伦・罗丁  你的律师
I'm Helen Rodin, your attorney.

1496
02:02:00,230 --> 02:02:03,980
这次谈话受诉讼委托人权益保护
This conversation is protected by attorney-client privilege.

1497
02:02:04,060 --> 02:02:05,060
你明白我的意思吗
You understand what that means?

1498
02:02:05,190 --> 02:02:06,230
明白
Yeah.

1499
02:02:06,310 --> 02:02:08,570
警察今天没问你话吧
Now, the police didn't talk to you, did they?

1500
02:02:08,730 --> 02:02:10,570
没有我在场他们不能审问你
They're not allowed to do that without me here.

1501
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:16,240
情况有多糟糕
How bad was it?

1502
02:02:18,240 --> 02:02:19,580
我杀了多少
How many did I...

1503
02:02:20,750 --> 02:02:22,750
这件事你一点都不记得了吗
You don't remember anything about the incident?

1504
02:02:26,330 --> 02:02:27,380
不记得
No.

1505
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:32,090
但是我听到了外面护士跟警察的对话
But I could hear the nurses talking to those cops out there.

1506
02:02:36,260 --> 02:02:38,390
我甚至都不记得自己想要这么做
I don't even remember wanting to do it!

1507
02:02:43,890 --> 02:02:45,270
听着  我不打算申辩了
Look, I'm not gonna fight this.

1508
02:02:46,770 --> 02:02:49,110
如果他们说是我做的  那就是我做的
If they say I done it, then I did.

1509
02:02:49,770 --> 02:02:51,440
我之前做过一些事
I done things before.

1510
02:02:54,110 --> 02:02:55,450
我做过坏事
I did something bad.

1511
02:02:58,070 --> 02:02:59,240
坏得透顶
Real bad.

1512
02:03:03,120 --> 02:03:04,790
那是很久以前的事了
A long time ago.

1513
02:03:08,290 --> 02:03:09,960
而且我还逃脱了罪名
And I got away with it.

1514
02:03:17,640 --> 02:03:18,800
詹姆斯
James,

1515
02:03:19,100 --> 02:03:20,930
你熟悉这个地方吗
how well do you know this place?

1516
02:03:32,230 --> 02:03:33,610
非常熟悉
Pretty well.

1517
02:03:34,320 --> 02:03:35,820
你觉得你是怎么做的
And how do you think you would have done it?

1518
02:03:39,490 --> 02:03:40,820
我猜
I guess

1519
02:03:46,830 --> 02:03:48,830
我会把车停在高速公路上
I would have parked up on the highway.

1520
02:03:49,250 --> 02:03:51,840
那个时候太阳应该是在我身后
The sun would be at my back that time of day.

1521
02:03:53,510 --> 02:03:54,590
我有一辆货车
I got a van.

1522
02:03:55,920 --> 02:03:57,590
把枪架在后面
Set up in back.

1523
02:03:58,340 --> 02:04:00,680
不需要担心会留下弹头
Wouldn't have to worry about my brass.

1524
02:04:02,510 --> 02:04:04,520
做得干净利落
Get away real clean, too.

1525
02:04:08,020 --> 02:04:10,020
是这样的吗
That sound about right?

1526
02:04:11,520 --> 02:04:13,690
听起来很像你的作风
Sounds as if you know your stuff.

1527
02:04:18,610 --> 02:04:19,990
我忘了你名字
I forget your name.

1528
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:22,030
我叫海伦
It's Helen.

1529
02:04:23,700 --> 02:04:24,990
海伦・罗丁
Helen Rodin.

1530
02:04:30,630 --> 02:04:32,790
你会没事的  詹姆斯
You're going to be okay, James.

1531
02:04:33,960 --> 02:04:35,710
我会保护你的
I am gonna take care of you.

1532
02:04:35,880 --> 02:04:37,380
你保护不了我
You can't protect me.

1533
02:04:40,640 --> 02:04:41,970
没人能
No one can.

1534
02:04:42,220 --> 02:04:43,550
为什么
From what?

1535
02:04:44,970 --> 02:04:46,010
谁要伤害你
From who?

1536
02:04:47,560 --> 02:04:49,230
有这么一个人
There's this guy.

1537
02:04:52,900 --> 02:04:54,400
他有点像个警察
He's a kind of cop.

1538
02:04:56,320 --> 02:04:57,990
至少他曾经是警察
At least he used to be.

1539
02:04:59,240 --> 02:05:01,240
他不在乎法律
He doesn't care about the law.

1540
02:05:02,910 --> 02:05:04,910
也不在乎证据
He doesn't care about proof.

1541
02:05:05,990 --> 02:05:07,740
只在乎什么是对的
He only cares about what's right.

1542
02:05:08,080 --> 02:05:09,910
我跟你讲话的时候看着我
Look at me when I'm talking to you!

1543
02:05:10,250 --> 02:05:11,750
他知道我的所作所为
He knows what I did.

1544
02:05:13,670 --> 02:05:14,750
他知道我身处何处
He knows where I am.

1545
02:05:16,340 --> 02:05:19,260
这个人给我一个承诺
And this guy, he made me a promise.

1546
02:05:19,510 --> 02:05:20,550
我说  闭嘴
I said, shut your mouth!

1547
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:23,930
如果我再惹上麻烦
If I ever got in trouble again,

1548
02:05:25,600 --> 02:05:26,930
他会来收拾我
he'd be there.
