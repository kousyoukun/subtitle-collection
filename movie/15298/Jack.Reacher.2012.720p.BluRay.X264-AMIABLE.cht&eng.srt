Move!

3
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:23,430
不是無期就是死刑 詹姆斯
lt's life or death now, James.

4
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,880
要麼死
By that,
l mean you're doing one or the other

5
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,140
要麼在羅克維優監獄了此一生
up in Rockview.

6
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,600
這位是地方檢查官 羅丁
This here is
District Attorney Rodin.

7
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,060
知道她對你的看法嗎
Want to know what he's wondering?

8
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:41,480
你或像男人那樣走出去
Whether you're gonna walk
like a man or cry like a pussy

9
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,320
或像女人哭啼地走進死囚牢房
on your way to the death house.

10
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:45,820
知道嗎 檢察官喜歡用針注射
See, the D.A. likes the needle,

11
00:08:46,150 --> 00:08:47,900
然而我
whereas me,

12
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:50,830
我很想讓你長命百歲
l like to see a man like you
live a long life

13
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:52,820
直到你所有牙都被打掉
with all your teeth knocked out.

14
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:57,000
被眾人多的獄友同志暴菊
Passed around till a brother
can't tell your part from a yawn.

15
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,340
放屁都不響
Now, l don't know
what kind of man you are,

16
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:01,160
不知道你喜歡哪一種命運
which of these two fates you prefer,

17
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,840
羅丁是個仁慈的人
他會讓你自己選擇
but Rodin here is a generous fellow.
He's willing to let you take your pick.

18
00:09:06,500 --> 00:09:11,180
如果你不想耗時費力
lf you save us and this city
a long and costly trial,

19
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:15,640
那就放棄聘請律師 馬上承認罪行 立刻
waive your rightto counsel and confess,
right now.

20
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,320
16個小時了
Sixteen hours.

21
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:30,860
偵探 該有結果了
Has to be some kind of
record, Detective.

22
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:37,540
這是什麼意思
What the hell is this?

23
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:50,550
傑克-雷徹是什麼人
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

24
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,880

至少能告訴我他是誰吧
Can you at least tell me who he is?

可以告訴你他以前是誰

He spent the bulk of his service

40
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:47,230
據傳他是個非常傑出的特工
in the Military Police.
By all accounts, a brilliant investigator.

41
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:49,770
但顯然也是個麻煩製造者
Apparently, a troublemaker, too.

42
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,450
被降職為上尉
Demoted to Captain.

43
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,190
後來又升到了上校
Worked his way back to Major.

44
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,610
兩年前他申請退役
Then two years ago, he musters out.

45
00:10:56,940 --> 00:11:01,950
在部隊裡度過了大部分時間
After a literal lifetime in the military,
he just up and quits. And then,

46
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,120
又突然退伍
for only the second time in his life,

47
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,090
然後第二次進入美國
之後就從人間蒸發了
he enters the United States
and simply disappears.

48
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,870
死了？
Dead, maybe?

49
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,560
不
Not according to Social Security
and a bank account in Virginia.

50
00:11:11,620 --> 00:11:13,550
根據社保和弗吉尼亞銀行帳戶信息看

51
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,920
他的退休金按月存入
His pension is deposited monthly

52
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:20,220
有人通過銀行轉帳把錢取走(西聯銀行)
and someone is making the occasional
withdrawal. All wire transfers.

53
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,890
沒有聯邦搜查令 無法查出在哪取錢
l can't find out where
without a federal warrant.

54
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,440
他不開車 也不開飛機
Well, he can't drive or fly.

55
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,980
至少不是真名
At least not under his real name.

56
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,730
有拘捕令嗎 有沒有犯罪記錄
-Any warrants?
-Record's clean.

57
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:35,280
算了吧 這麼難找的人
一定能找到理由通緝他
Come on! A guy this hard to find?
Gotta be wanted for something.

58
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:36,910
他沒有任何犯罪記錄
His record is clean.

59
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,950
那麼
So,

60
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,580
怎麼才能找到這個雷徹
how do we find this Reacher?

61
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:48,160
你無法找到 除非他想讓你找到他
Obviously, you don't find this guy
unless he wants to be found.

62
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,580
打掃一下長官
有個叫傑克-雷徹的人想見你
Excuse me, sir. There's
a Jack Reacher here to see you.

63
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:03,140
你有什麼事嗎
Can l help you?

64
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,640
詹姆斯-巴爾
James Barr.

65
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,780
好了 你見過他了 你們怎麼認識的
So, now you've seen him.
How do you know him?

66
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,320
為什麼不對他實行保護性監禁
Why wasn't he in protective custody?

67
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,570
是工作疏忽
That was an oversight.

68
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:24,000
是監獄裡的勢利小人把他扔進了狼窩
More like some Corrections flunky
threw him to the wolves.

69
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:25,950
好像是這樣
Just as likely.

70
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,120
可是事到如今已經無法挽回
But it's done and we can't undo it.

71
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:29,370
現在怎麼樣了
So what happens now?

72
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,790
好吧 現在他處在昏迷中
Well, now he's in a coma.

73
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:35,630
他昏迷不醒
We'll try him when he wakes up.
lf he wakes up.

74
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,380
如果他能醒過來 我們要審判他
好了該你談談了 雷徹
Okay? Now it's your turn, Reacher.

75
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,800
他為什麼要你做證人
Why did he call you as a witness?

76
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,470
我不相信他會這麼做
l don't believe he did.

77
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,270
他指名道姓要你來
Well, l believe
he asked for you by name.

78
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,900
我能看一下證據嗎
Any chance l could look
at the evidence?

79
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,600
你回答完幾個問題再說
No way.
Not till you answer some questions.

80
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,930
很高興認識你
Nice meeting you.

81
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:50,360
嗨 嗨 嗨!
站住 雷徹先生
-Hey. Hey. Hey!
-Mr Reacher.

82
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,980
- 嘿 別動
- 嗨，站在原地別動
-Mr Reacher!
-Hey, stop! Stop right there!

83
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,440
我們有有言在先
We had a deal.

84
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:55,770
我帶你去見巴爾 你告訴我你瞭解的情況
l take you to Barr,
you tell me what you know.

85
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,610
你說他射殺了五個人 可是他昏迷不醒
l know you say he shot five people,
l know he's in a coma.

86
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,820
有個公交車站
l know there's a bus station
three miles away

87
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,740
我用24分鐘走到那
and l can walk there in 24 minutes.

88
00:13:01,860 --> 00:13:03,200
你要放棄你的朋友
So you're just going to
walk out on your friend?

89
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,950
- 他不是我的朋友
- 那他為什麼會要求你來
-He's not my friend.
-Why'd he ask for you,then?

90
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,030
跟他殺死五個人是一個原因
Well, same reason he shot five people,
he's crazy.

91
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,210
他瘋了 等一下
Hey. Hold on.

92
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,540
別攔著我
Don't do that.

93
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,330
你們倆這麼做卑鄙了
Well, this is a new low,
even for both of you.

94
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,300
沒有我在場 你們不能和我的委託人談話
You do not talk to my client
without me present.

95
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,420
你知道
You know that.

96
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,670
我們沒有和他談話 他處在昏迷之中
We weren't talking to your client.
He's in a coma, for Christ's sakes.

97
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:23,260
- 你是巴爾的律師
- 海倫-羅丁 傑克-雷徹
-You're Barr's attorney?

Yeah, she's the
District Attorney's daughter.

100
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:28,010
這事兒說來話長
lt's a good story, actually.

101
00:13:28,090 --> 00:13:29,220
這事兒說來話長
l'd like to hear it.

102
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,430
你們是怎麼找到他的
How'd you find him?
How'd they find you?

103
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,060
你不能和這個人談話
You can't be talking to this man.
Two strikes in one day.

104
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,020
不是你想像的那樣 是他找到的我們
-lt's not what it looks like.
-He came to us.

105
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,770
- 你見了檢察官
- 這樣做違法嗎
-You went to the D.A.?
-ls there a law against that?

106
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,280
目前你還沒有違法
None you're currently breaking.

107
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,450
行啦 別把大家搞得下不來台
Come on, before this gets awkward.
Now, hey.

108
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,870
快說 法庭上見
Say, "See you in court." For me.

109
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:46,530
再見偵探
Goodbye, Detective.

110
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,540
- 很高興認識你
- 我也是
-Weird meeting you.
-Likewise.

111
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:49,960
走吧
Let's go.

112
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:54,083
So...

113
00:13:57,210 --> 00:13:58,550
你是傑克-雷徹
你是檢察官的女兒
So, you're Jack Reacher.

114
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,380
走吧
-So you're the D.A.'s daughter.
-Oh, Jesus. Please.

115
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:03,300
－上帝 這種工作關係合法嗎
－幸運的是合法
-ls that even legal?
-Fortunately.

116
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:05,790
－怎麼會有這種安排
－你宣誓作證之後再告訴你
-How does that happen?
-l'll tell you after deposition.

117
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,920
別讓我宣誓作證
You don't want to depose me.

118
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:08,090
你是被告證人
Oh, well, you're my only
defence witness.

119
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:10,890
- 我不是
- 你的朋友詹姆斯認為你是
-l'm not a defence witness.
-Your friend James thinks you are.

120
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:12,470
為什麼所有人都認為他是我朋友
He's not my friend.
Why does everyone assume that?

121
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,600
為什麼所有人都認為他是我的朋友
Well, why else would he ask for you

122
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:14,720
他要求見你 你來幫助他
and why would you
come here to help him?

123
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:18,230
我不是來幫助他 是為了把他埋了
l didn't come here to help him.
l came here to bury him.

124
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:41,420
(布魯希爾建築公司)

125

林斯基
Linsky.

126
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:48,800
傑克-雷徹是什麼人
Who the hell is Jack Reacher?

127

-你為什麼這麼難找
- 不可能找到我的
-So why are you so hard to find?
-l'm impossible to find.

128
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:54,470
為什麼找不到
Why is that?

129
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:57,980
這麼說吧 這是我的職業習慣
Well, you could say it started out as an
exercise and became an addiction.

130
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,150
你逃跑嗎
Are you on the run?

131
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,700
我的車要開了 快點吧 律師
My bus is leaving.
You better hurry, counsellor.

132
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:05,900
你是怎麼認識巴爾的
How do you know James Barr?

133
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,610
-你為什麼要替他辯護  
-我是律師
-Why are you representing him?
-l'm a lawyer.

134
00:15:07,690 --> 00:15:10,330
公共辯護人也有機會證明他無罪
So is a public defender, with just as
much chance of clearing Barr.

135
00:15:10,490 --> 00:15:11,790
我並不是想證明他無罪
l'm not trying to clear him,

136
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:14,330
而是要他不被判死刑
l am just trying
to keep him off death row.

137
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,880
-你想證明他精神失常
-這也是一種選擇
-By proving he's insane?
-Well, that's one option.

138
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:19,620
跟你爸爸做對
And sticking it to your father because...

139
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,170
不是他 是地方檢察官辦公室
No. Not my father.
The Office of the District Attorney.

140
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:24,970
因為地方檢察官辦公室從未承認你是淑女
Because the Office of the District
Attorney never bought you a pony.

141
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:28,720
羅丁檢察官從未打輸過死刑的案件
知道為什麼嗎
D.A. Rodin's never lost a capital case.
You know why?

142
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,350
政客都愛仗勢欺人
lmpeccable tailoring.

143
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,310
-他從來都不接打不贏的案子
-知己知彼
-He never picks a fight he can'twin.
-Worked for the Red Baron.

144
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,060
每個謀殺嫌疑犯都有兩個選擇
Every murder suspect in this town
is given a choice.

145
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,810
認罪或者面對死刑
Confess or face death.

146
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:39,230
和從未輸過的檢察官打官司
Against a D.A. who never loses.

147
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,480
我的律師事務所相信無罪的人
My firm has reason to believe
more than one innocent man

148
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,060
但都會毫不抵抗就認罪伏法
has gone down without a fight.

149
00:15:43,650 --> 00:15:45,150
我明白了
Oh, l get it.

150
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,320
你是個理想主義者
You're an idealist.

151
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,660
不 我是和平主義者
No. l'm a pacifist.

152
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,250
想廢除死刑是高尚行為
lt's a noble crusade.

153
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:55,240
但這次你打不贏 相信我
詹姆斯-巴爾有罪
But this is not the fight. Trust me.
James Barr's guilty.

154
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:57,210
你還沒看證據呢
You haven't even seen the evidence.

155
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,260
這是保密談話嗎
ls this a privileged conversation?

156
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:07,100
對 是對訴訟委託人的談話
你說的每一句話都不能轉述
Of course, it's a client conference.
Nothing you say here can be repeated.

157
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,850
有四種人會參軍
There are four types of people
who join the military.

158
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,720
有人是為了家族榮譽
For some, it's a family trade.

159
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,560
有愛國者渴望為國效勞
Others are patriots, eager to serve.

160
00:16:16,890 --> 00:16:18,890
還有些為了工作
Next, you have those
who just need a job.

161
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:23,400
最後一類是想要一種合法的殺人方式
Then there's the kind who want a legal
means of killing other people.

162
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,740
詹姆斯-巴爾就是這種人
James Barr was one of those.

163
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:28,070
他當上了狙擊手
He made sniper.

164
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,400
刻苦訓練 一周2000次
Trained hard.
Two thousand rounds a week.

165
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:33,830
每槍都要求射中腦門
And with every shot,
he's taught to visualise

166
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,530
就是要一擊致命
the base of a man's skull
through his reticle.

167
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:39,590
出血少 死的快
The sweet spot where
the medulla meets the spine.

168
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,252
Visualise that puff of pink mist.

169
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,930
他終於被派往伊拉克
Finally, he's deployed to lraq.

170
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:48,920
安排他去掩護射擊組
He's put on overwatch.

171
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,420
日復一日 他通過瞄準鏡盯著平民
All day long
he stares through a scope at civilians.

172
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:54,260
女人
Women.

173
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,640
孩子
Children.

174
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:58,770
日復一日 漫長的2年
Day in, day out, for two long years

175
00:16:58,890 --> 00:17:01,890
沒接到命令發過一槍
without ever once being
cleared to fire a single shot.

176
00:17:02,930 --> 00:17:04,780
後來開始撤軍
Then comes the drawdown.

177
00:17:05,770 --> 00:17:07,400
對詹姆斯-巴爾來說 戰爭結束了
For James Barr, the war's over.

178
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:10,280
一周射擊2000次
Two thousand rounds a week.

179
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:14,240
他職業生涯總共射擊25萬次
竟然沒有一槍是真人做靶子
A quarter million rounds in his career,
not one at a human target.

180
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:17,620
人處於飢餓之中 會飢不擇食
You've been hungry.
You've been horny.

181
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:20,290
身上癢癢又撓不著
You've had an itch you can't scratch.

182
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,790
想像那種感覺
lmagine that feeling.
Days. Weeks. Years.

183
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:29,130
天天年年 這種難受要經歷25萬次
lmagine that feeling times 200,000,
plus 50,000 more.

184
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,340
設想一下 在54度的高溫下站崗
明天就要回家了 知道嗎
lmagine it's 130 degrees on the deck
and tomorrow you're going home

185
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,430
如果你現在不撓癢癢 就永遠沒機會了
and you know if you don't
scratch that itch now,

186
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:37,140
需要發洩一下
you never will.

187
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,140
需要一個目標
You need a release.

188
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,310
需要找一個目標
You need a target.

189
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,610
而他的大腦從未有過明確目標
And the who of it
never once enters your mind.

190
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,830
他隱蔽得非常好
He covered his tracks well,

191
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:05,630
跟神志清醒的人一樣
just like sane people do.

192
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,880
可是我抓到了他 事實面前他認了罪
He almost got away with it, too.
But l caught him. And he confessed.

193
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:12,720
那他為什麼沒進監獄
So why didn't he go to prison?

194
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:17,180
巴爾不知道他殺的安保人員
What Barr didn't know that day was the
four civilian contractors he'd picked off

195
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:20,550
是參加過集體強姦晚會的人
just spent the weekend
at what they call a rape-rally.

196
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,730
28個女人 從11歲到54歲
lt was 28 women,
ages 54 on down to 11.

197
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,820
這些人是我在結案前找到的
Those were just the ones l could find
before the case was shut down.

198
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:31,990
挖得越深 越令人髮指
See, the deeper l dug, the uglier it got.

199
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,660
七年 偉大的任務之後
And after seven long years
of"Mission Accomplished,"

200
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,330
安保公司的人想隱瞞真相
someone in the corporation just wanted
the whole thing to end quietly.

201
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:43,330
把此案歸結為戰爭導致的人精神失常 
讓殺人犯一走了之
So they chalked it up to the fog of war,
made the murders go away.

202
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,750
這是絕密信息
This is classified information.

203
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:48,840
所以是保密談話
And that's why the privilege.

204
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,170
但你可以把這些告訴檢察官
But you were ready
to tell this to the D.A.

205
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,220
我上次見到巴爾時 向他做過承諾
The last time l saw Barr,
l made him a promise.

206
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,180
當我看到這個消息 就過來兌現承諾
And when l saw his name on the news,
l came here to keep it.

207
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:03,060
-現在知道不用這麼做了
-你怎麼會這麼肯定
-But now l know l don't have to.
-How can you be sure?

208
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,680
你還沒有看過證據
You still haven't seen the evidence.

209
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,740
你父親看過了 他不會接打不贏的官司
Your father has.
And he doesn't pick a fight he can't win.

210
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:12,400
巴爾不會再逃脫殺人罪名
Barr's not getting away
with murder again.

211
00:19:13,270 --> 00:19:14,360
有可能
He might.

212
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:18,240
在監獄裡 他大腦受到嚴重損傷
He suffered a severe brain injury
in state custody.

213
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,120
如果他能醒來
When he wakes up, if he wakes up,

214
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,960
可能會不記得這件事 或者什麼都不記得
he may not remember the event,
he may not remember anything at all.

215
00:19:24,410 --> 00:19:27,750
這個案子不是巴爾有罪或無罪
And this case won't be about
James Barr's guilt or innocence.

216
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:31,080
而是他能否接受審判
lt'll be about his ability to stand trial.

217
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:36,390
我把一切都告訴了你 你還想為他辯護嗎
After everything l just told you,
you still want to defend him?

218
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,560
我想看到他受到公正的審判
l want to see he gets a fair trial.

219
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:43,270
你說過他在巴格達已經認罪了
You said he confessed in Baghdad.

220
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:45,430
他這次沒有承認
He didn't confess this time.

221
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,920
這次他做的孽更多 他要求見你
-This time he knows better.
-This time he asked for you.

222
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:51,190
我想要知道為什麼
l want to know why.

223
00:19:51,270 --> 00:19:54,320
你想要知道為什麼 
這次他做的孽更多 他要求見你
You want to know why.
l can see it's eating you.

224
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,990
你無法問巴爾
And you can't ask Barr,

225
00:19:56,110 --> 00:19:58,450
檢察官又不讓你看證據
and the D.A. won't let you
see the evidence.

226
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:04,450
我的首席調查員可以看出那些證據
My lead investigator has complete
access to the evidence. All of it.

227
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:09,500
你的首席調查員在哪兒   他要出城了
-So where's your lead investigator?
-About to catch a bus out of town.

228
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,010
謝謝你的咖啡 律師
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.

229
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,860
你要明白 你不僅讓我看證據
You understand you're not just
asking me to look at the evidence.

230
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:21,740
還要讓我看那個準備殺手
You're asking me to look
at a cold-blooded killer.

231
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:25,360
我知道她是個有罪的人
A man l know to be guilty.
A man you want to keep off death row.

232
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:28,330
即使你不想看到他被判死刑
And you're asking me
to look at him objectively.

233
00:21:29,530 --> 00:21:31,380
你要求我客觀地看待他
Yes, that is what l'm asking.

234
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:38,880
是的 這就是我的要求
l'll do it. On one condition.

235
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:40,890
我接了 但有一個條件 說吧
Name it.

236
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:45,390
你必須客觀地看待受害者
You have to look
at the victims objectively.

237
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:50,400
你建議我怎麼做
How do you suggest l do that?

238
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,730
誰 法裡奧爾先生嗎
-Yes?
-Mr Farrior?

239
00:21:56,270 --> 00:21:57,900
我是海倫-羅丁 我們通過電話
l'm Helen Rodin.
We spoke on the phone.

240
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,240
當然
Of course.

241
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:04,900
你要為那人辯護
You said you're defending
the man that ki...
That man.

242
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,080
我要做詹姆斯-巴爾的辯護律師
l represent James Barr, yes.

243
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:11,240
你要問關於我女兒的問題嗎
And you have questions
about my daughter?

244
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,420
是的
l do.

245
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:16,590
為什麼
What for?

246
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:20,760
我希望瞭解受害者是什麼人
l was hoping to get a better sense
of who the victims were as...

247
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,850
就是說 他們是什麼樣人
That is to say, who they were as people.
As human beings.

248
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:33,100
考慮到你的地位 這不正常 是不是
That's a bit unusual,
considering your position, isn't it?

249
00:22:33,430 --> 00:22:34,430
說得對
That is true.

250
00:22:35,100 --> 00:22:38,270
通常情況下 處在我這個地位的人
Normally someone in my position
would want the jury

251
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,780
應該讓陪審團知道得越少越好
to know as little as possible about the...

252
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:43,780
你的當事人殺了那麼多人
The people that your client killed.

253
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,120
冷酷無情
ln cold blood.

254
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:53,990
你和其它家庭的人談過了嗎
Have you spoken

-Well, l think it would be...
-lnsensitive?

265
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,610
不合適
lnappropriate?

266
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,790
你想要知道關於我女兒的材料
Everything that you want to know

報上對她作了全面的報道

269
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:47,930
她的訃告上做了其它說明

278
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,150
也許我該走了    請等下
You stay where you are.

279
00:26:20,490 --> 00:26:22,840
那個人死有餘辜
That man deserves to die, Miss Rodin.

280
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,130
你為什麼要為他辯護

我犯了嚴重的錯誤

What the hell are you doing?

285
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:52,360
我在幹什麼 怎麼了
What am l... What?

286
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:53,520
是真的嗎
ls it true?

287
00:26:53,690 --> 00:26:55,730
你在和受害者的家人談話 你一個人
You're talking to the victims' families
You? Alone?

288
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:58,740
你怎麼知道的
How do you know that?
How did you find me here?

289
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:01,120
我是地方檢察官居 瞭解情況是我的工作
l'm the District Attorney.
lt's my business to know.

290
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,250
這不是回答問題
That's not an answer.

291
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:06,540
好了 你不是能力超強的調查員
Well, you're not the only one
with crack investigators, Helen.

292
00:27:06,870 --> 00:27:09,370
對了 我知道雷徹的情況
That's right. l know about Reacher.

293
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:12,050
你的首席調查員
Your lead investigator is a war veteran

294
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,720
是失蹤兩年的老兵
who's been missing
for the last two years.

295
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,630
你如何能擔保他情緒穩定
How can you vouch
for his state of mind?

296
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,060
並相信他 告訴你的一切
How can you trust anything he tells you?

297
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:20,390
你根本不瞭解他
You don't know the man.

298
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,720
告訴我
Tell me this,
does he know you can't pay him?

299
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,230
他知道你不能付他報酬嗎
That your own firm
didn't want this case?

300
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:29,570
你的律師不想接這個案子嗎
That nobody wants this case?

301
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,530
沒人願意接這個案子 在你的委託人醒來之前
You never even spoke to your client
before he wound up in a coma.

302
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:36,330
你從未和他談過話 聽我說 聽著
我是作為你的父親和你說話
Oh, now listen to me! Listen.
Listen, l'm speaking as your father.

303
00:27:36,570 --> 00:27:38,440
無論我們之間有何分岐
Whatever our differences
have been in the past,

304
00:27:38,570 --> 00:27:40,240
你都應該聽我的
you gotta listen to me now.

305
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:44,580
你正在犯一個可怕的錯誤
You're making a terrible mistake.

306
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,420
你不能夠贏得這場官司
You cannot win this case.

307
00:27:48,410 --> 00:27:51,420
會毀了你的事業
為了什麼 為了什麼
You're going to ruin your career.
Why? For what?

308
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:55,420
為了傷害我嗎
To hurt me? To change me?

309
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,260
- 海倫
- 別碰我

謝謝讓我參觀
Thanks for letting me take a look.

311
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,270
我們喜歡被告的朋友
Hey. We love it
when friends of the accused

312
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,060
把我們的工作貶得一無是處
try to tear our work to shreds.

313
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,620
他不是我的朋友
He's not my friend.

314
00:28:16,770 --> 00:28:19,780
你接著說 發現什麼漏洞了嗎
So you keep saying. Find any holes?

315
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:22,280
你們沒必要讓他住進醫院
Well, you didn't have to
put him in the hospital.

316
00:28:23,110 --> 00:28:26,460
除此之外 警察的工作也幹得很漂亮
Other than that, damn fine police work.
lt's open and shut.

317
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,170
結案並不難 我能說什麼呢
犯罪現場是座金礦
What can l say?
The scene was a gold mine.

318
00:28:30,290 --> 00:28:33,790
我們都知道只有高手才能挖到金子
Come on. Now we both know
gold's only as good as the man digging.

319
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,800
你想來隨時都可以
Yeah, well, anytime you want to come
back, take a look at this stuff...

320
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:38,640
不 謝謝 沒這個必要
No, thanks. Don't need to.

321
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,460
你從來不記筆記
You never took any notes.

322
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,140
沒必要
l don't need to.

323
00:28:44,930 --> 00:28:48,310
你可真是軍隊裡的大能人
So you were some real hot shit
in the Army, huh?

324
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,270
我幹得還行吧
l did all right.

325
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,320
軍隊裡都幹些什麼
So what does an Army cop do mostly?
Break up bar fights?

326
00:28:53,810 --> 00:28:56,810
給酒吧鬥毆的人拉架
不 我和你不一樣
l did what you do pretty much,
with one minor difference.

327
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:57,980
只有一點區別 什麼區別
What's that?

328
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,830
每個嫌疑犯都是訓練有素的殺手
Every suspect was a trained killer.

329
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,120
再次謝謝
Thanks again.

330
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,170
你認為他為什麼要付費停車
Why do you think he paid for parking?

331
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,795
Pardon?

332
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:18,680
他向陌生的人發射6顆子彈
He's about to fire six shots
into a crowd of strangers.

333
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:21,170
會擔心女抄表員給他罰單
And he's worried about the meter maid?

334
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,010
精神病 解釋不通嗎
"Simple loony" won't do it for you?

335
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,350
我喜歡有另外一個推理
l like to have
at least one alternate theory.

336
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:29,680
習慣
Habit.

337
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,690
肌肉記憶
Muscle memory.

338
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,350
他不知道自己在做這種事
l don't think he knew he was doing it.

339
00:29:36,350 --> 00:29:38,700
我說過了 幹得真漂亮
Like l said, it's damn fine work.

340
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,030

00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,710
只見樹木
Forest for the trees, Detective.

345
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:01,720
不見森林 偵探
Forest for the trees.

346

What's your name?

351
00:31:33,550 --> 00:31:34,980
吉米瑞斯
Jimmie Reese.

352
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,570
你看上去不像是吉米
You don't look like a Jimmie.

353
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,690
那像誰
What do l look like?

354
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:45,490
我不知道 但不像吉米
l don't know. But not a Jimmie.

355
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:48,910
你是新來的吧
So you're new in town?

356
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,000
算是吧
Usually.

357
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:53,490
這裡太吵了
lt's kind of loud in here.

358
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:57,830
你也許想去靜一點的地方 我有車
Do you want to maybe go
someplace quieter? l have a car.

359
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:59,500
你夠開車的年齡嗎
You're old enough to drive?

360
00:32:00,410 --> 00:32:02,760
我到了能做很多事情的年齡
l'm old enough to do a lot of things.

361
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,680
我在節省開始 桑迪
l'm on a budget, Sandy.

362
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,260
什麼
What?

363
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,850
我買不起你
l can't afford you.

364
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,510
我不是妓女
l'm not a hooker.

365
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:13,180
我真的沒錢和你處朋友
Then l really can't afford you.

366
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:16,020
認真點 我在汽車零件商店工作
Seriously, l work at the auto parts store.

367
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:20,690
我是說 人們都願意花最少錢玩兒女人
What l mean is, the cheapest woman
tends to be the one you pay for.

368
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:24,700
我不是妓女
l am not a hooker!

369
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,360
我不過開個玩笑
No. A hooker would get the joke.

370
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:29,530
-這是在幹什麼
-他說我是妓女
-What's this?
-He called me a whore.

371
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,700
那是真的嗎
ls that true?

372
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:42,210
好吧 沒人說她是妓女
而我說她是蕩婦
Well, nobody said whore.
She inferred hooker, but l meant slut.

373
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:44,210
她是我們的妹妹
Hey. That's our sister.

374
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:46,550
她是接吻高手嗎
ls she a good kisser?

375
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,550
出去
Hey. Outside.

376
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,390
先把帳結了
Pay your cheque first.

377
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:53,550
我一會兒再付
l'll pay later.

378
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:56,220
一會兒就付不了了
You won't be able to.

379
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,730
你認為會是這樣嗎
You think?

380
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,390
一直是 你試試看
All the time. You should try it.

381
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:01,980
我要狠揍你一頓
lt's a great joke,
but l'm going to beat your ass.

382
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,810
你想在這裡打還是外面
Do you want to do that here or outside?

383
00:33:09,070 --> 00:33:10,410
外面
Outside.

384
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,330
呆在這裡 桑迪
Stay here, Sandy.

385
00:33:16,570 --> 00:33:18,330
我不介意看見血
l don't mind the sight of blood.

386
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,080
看見出血 你才像個姑娘
When it means
you're not pregnant, anyway.

387
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,770
你還以為你是個牛仔 傻瓜
You still think you're funny now, creep?

388
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:45,440
閉嘴 桑迪 沒人跟你說話
Shut your mouth, Sandy!
No one is talking to you.

389
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:54,360
你現在走還來得及
lt's your last chance to walk away.

390
00:33:56,110 --> 00:33:58,110
你在開玩笑嗎 五對一
Are you kidding? lt's five against one.

391
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,130
三對一 你不識數嗎
lt's three against one.

392
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,460
我只要先打倒你
How do you figure?

393
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:07,380
就能輕易解決那兩個跟屁蟲
Well, once l take out the leader,
which is you,

394
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:11,300
最後兩個人
l'll have to contend
with one or two enthusiastic wingmen.

395
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:14,800
就會逃之夭夭
The last two guys, they always run.

396
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:16,640
你以前幹過這種事
You've done this before?

397
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:18,220
是的
Yeah.

398
00:34:20,140 --> 00:34:21,640
天不早了
lt's getting late.

00:34:24,310 --> 00:34:25,400
記住
Remember,

400
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,560
這是你自找的
you wanted this.

401
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:36,120
好了 你完蛋了
lt's okay. You're okay.

402

我們把架打完吧
Let's get this done.

406
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:09,860
還想打嗎
Really?

407
00:35:13,610 --> 00:35:15,530

Shit!

408
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:24,880
趴在地上
On the ground!

409

夥計們反應也太神速了
That's a pretty impressive
response time, fellas.

410
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,380
趴下
Do it!

411
00:35:36,380 --> 00:35:37,720
手放在背後
Hands behind your back.

412
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,060
誰雇的你

413
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,390
走
Let's go.

414
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,330

00:36:02,570 --> 00:36:04,420
我是不是噴了太多的香水

我有鼻炎 愛默生偵探
Breathing too sternly.
Detective Emerson.

417
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,250
- 有人死了嗎?
- 如果死了呢
-Somebody dead?
-And if someone is?

418
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:16,250
那他們也是羞辱死的 我下手很輕
Then they died of shame.
'Cause l was being gentle.

我現在明白你為什麼到處走 雷徹
l'm starting to understand
why you move around a lot, Reacher.

420
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:21,680
有人死了麼
So no one's dead.

421
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,600
有個小子可能再也走不了路了
One guy

422
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:27,110

-很想
-You want to charge me.
-Very much.

423
00:36:27,350 --> 00:36:28,440
可是沒有人要告我
But no one's pressing.

424
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:30,280
很遺憾 沒有
Sadly, no.

425
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,360
我可以自由了嗎
Am l free to go?

426
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,110
愛默生
Hey, Emerson.

428
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:48,620

What's that?

429
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,710
巴爾步槍上面的序列號
lt's the serial number on Barr's rifle.

430
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,460
你在為我工作 知道嗎
You're working for me,
do you understand that?

431
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,640
你做的每件事都給我的律師所
So everything you do
is a reflection on my firm. On me.

432
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:04,800
造成惡劣的影響

433
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,060
-我被人陷害了
-你在和律師說話
You're talking to a lawyer.

434
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,060
有個女孩 她主動找我 故意找茬
There was this girl. She came onto me.
Picked a fight.

435
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:10,730
這事總在酒吧發生
Which never happens in a bar.

436
00:37:10,890 --> 00:37:12,890
當我告訴她我叫什麼名字時
She was thrown
when l told her my name.

437
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,220
她很吃驚 她遇到了拳王泰森
She was expecting Mike Tyson?

438
00:37:14,310 --> 00:37:15,980
她不相信我是吉米瑞斯

439

揚基隊的二壘手
Yankees second baseman.

440
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,280
為什麼你要說是二壘手
Why did you say you were
a Yankees second baseman?

441
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,160
我一直使用揚基隊二壘手的名字
l always use Yankees second basemen.

442
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,490
又沒說我就是揚基隊的二壘手
l didn't say l was a Yankees
second baseman, l just said...

443
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:32,170
現在重點是
Look, the point is,

444
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,170
是她想聽到傑克-雷徹這個名字
she was expecting to hear
"Jack Reacher."

445
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:35,420
她知道我是誰
She knew who l was.

446
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,500
還沒打 警察就來了
And the cops were rolling
before the fight even started.

447
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,510
這五個小子是她的哥哥 算了吧
And those five guys are her brothers?
Come on.

448
00:37:41,500 --> 00:37:44,180
有人派這幾個小子來幹掉我
Someone sent those boys
to put me down.

449

Who?

如果今天有人跟蹤你
lf someone followed you
at the river today,

451
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,520
可能是警察
it was probably a cop.
And l highly doubt...

452
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:56,100
有三件事警察從來不做
There are three things cops never do.

453

They don't vote Democrat,
they don't drive Cadillacs,

454
00:37:58,940 --> 00:38:01,110
或者用私人汽車辦案
and they never use personal vehicles.

455
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,620
不是警察

You think your father's office
would set me up?

458
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,120
為什麼有人要害你
Why would anyone set you up?

459
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,450
你有新線索
How was your day?

460
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:12,040
雷徹
lt went exactly the way l think

461
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,790
你預計的事發生了
you hoped it would.

462
00:38:16,870 --> 00:38:17,920
是嗎
You okay?

463
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,090
嗯

464
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:22,800

00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:00,680
我剛才說了什麼
What was l saying?

524
00:42:00,850 --> 00:42:03,350
- 五個無辜的人
- 隨意地被謀殺了 是的
-Five innocent people.
-Murdered at random, yes.

525
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,110
你知道在美國 每年有多少人死亡嗎
You know how many people
die in this country every year?

526
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,780
250萬人
Two and a half million.

527
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:13,200
每天
That means every day,

528
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:17,110
約有七千美國人閉上眼睛
roughly 7,000 average Americans
wake up for the last time.

529
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:20,500
上星期五 他們中的五個死在一起了
Last Friday, five of them converged
on a single spot and died together.

530
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:21,620
這是巧合嗎
ls that random?

531
00:42:21,700 --> 00:42:23,120
那你說是什麼
What else would you call it?

532
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:26,420
可能達倫和南希之間有婚外情
Well, take Darren and Nanry.
Odds are they were having an affair.

533
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:27,540
你說什麼
Excuse me?

534
00:42:27,620 --> 00:42:30,340
人們不會在上班路上給妻子買花
You don't buy roses
for your wife on the way to work.

535
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,130
而是在回家的路上買
You buy them on the way home.

536
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:35,810
正常人不會擔心信用卡上的付款記錄
And you don't worry about a charge
showing up on your credit card

537
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:37,630
結婚紀念日在週末
when your anniversary is that weekend.

538
00:42:38,050 --> 00:42:39,970
除非是想隱藏這個禮物
Unless it's the gift you're hiding.

539
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:45,020
她一直向前走
And that's why she kept walking

540
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,400
而其他人都在逃跑
while everyone else ran.

541
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,990
你無法證明你的推論
You can't prove that.

542
00:42:51,230 --> 00:42:54,580
這很難嗎
手機 電子郵件
How hard would it be?
Cell phones, e-mails.

543
00:42:56,570 --> 00:42:58,660
只要有人願意調查就行
All it takes is someone willing to dig.

544
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,820
你想說什麼
What's your point exactly?

545
00:43:00,910 --> 00:43:04,410
那兩個遇害人不是偶然相遇
My point is that two of the victims
weren't there strictly by chance.

546
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,260
我需要一份巴爾合夥人的名單
l need a list of Barr's known associates.

547
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,510
他沒有合夥人 很孤僻
There isn't one. He didn't have any.

548
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,760
他甚至都不和鄰居說話
He's a classic loner.
He didn't even talk to his neighbours.

549
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,260
他是一個安靜的人
從來不打擾別人
He was a quiet man.
Never bothered anyone.

550
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:16,680
是的
Yeah, exactly.

551
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,930
- 你有他的信用卡記錄嗎
- 我能拿到 要它做什麼
-You have his credit card statement?
-l can get it. Why?

552
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:22,310
我需要他曾去過地方的清單
所有的地方
l need the list
of all the places he hung out.

553
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,860
酒吧 球場 俱樂部
Bars, bowling alleys, strip clubs,

554
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:26,770
射擊場
gun ranges.

555
00:43:27,100 --> 00:43:28,650
能記錄到他去過的地方
Anywhere someone
would remember him.

556
00:43:28,730 --> 00:43:29,900
你希望找到什麼
What do we hope to find?

557
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,190
我需要睡一會兒
l need some sleep.

558
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:34,780
你也是
You, too.

559
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,930
你不是想要
You don't really think l'm gonna...

560
00:43:43,620 --> 00:43:45,620
七點鐘回來接我
Be back to pick me up at 7:00.

561
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:51,380
好的
Yep. Absolutely.

562
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:32,840
你和誰在一起
Who's with you?

563
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,500
發生什麼事了
What happened?

564
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:37,340
哦是他 對不對
That's him, isn't it?

565
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:39,510
我看不見你
l ain't seeing you, man!

566
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,430
放鬆 發生什麼事
Relax. What happened?

567
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:45,310
巴爾的律師雇了一名調查員
Barr's attorney hired an investigator.

568
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,520
叫雷徹  軍隊裡的頂級高手
Name of Reacher.
Some sort of top-shelf Army cop.

569
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,690
他和巴爾同時在巴格達服役
He was in Baghdad
the same time as Barr.

570
00:44:51,350 --> 00:44:52,520
怎麼了
So?

571
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,360
巴爾點名要這個大兵
So Barr asked for this soldier by name.

572
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,320
他今天出現在高速公路橋
Then he shows up at the river today.
Then up on the highway.

573
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,200
他好像知道我們的事
Almost like he knew something.

574
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,700
你說過不喜歡別人向我們提問題
And you said we don't like
people asking questions.

575
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:06,200
對不喜歡
No, we sure don't.

576
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:07,790
所以我採取了措施
So l took steps.

577
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,880
你採取了措施
You took steps.

578
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:13,380
當地人 我哥們
Local people. My guys.

579
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,300
你要遭報應了
And it blew back on you.

580
00:45:16,210 --> 00:45:17,930
我以為他們五個人能解決問題
l figured five guys would do it.

581
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,050
你已經超越了你的權限 到此為止
This franchise was yours to manage.

582
00:45:21,380 --> 00:45:24,220
下一步是我們的事 明白嗎
That's all. Maintenance is our thing,
you understand?

583
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:25,350
我知道 我無法聯繫你
Yeah, l understand. l couldn't reach you!

584
00:45:25,470 --> 00:45:26,470
這是我們的工作方式
Well, that's how this works.

585
00:45:26,550 --> 00:45:27,900
好吧 我必須作決定
Well, l had to make a decision!

586
00:45:28,140 --> 00:45:30,690
- 這些本地人  我需要他們的名字
- 在文件中
-These locals, l wanttheir names.
-lt's in the file.

587
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:32,050
他們中有人認識你嗎
Any ofthem knowwho you are?

588
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,150
有一個 但我已經解決了
Just one, but l took care of it.

589
00:45:35,560 --> 00:45:36,650
你
You...

590
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:39,520
-屍體在哪 
-已經分屍了
-Where's the body?
-lt's distributed.

591
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:41,780
放鬆 沒有人去找它
Relax! No one's gonna find it.

592
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:44,160
- 假如我們要找呢  
- 為什麼
-Suppose we want it found, yeah?
-Why the hell would you want it found?

593
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:47,240
我們有自己的方式
'Cause we got a way of doing things
so they stay done.

594
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:49,080
乾淨利落
Clean!

595
00:45:49,660 --> 00:45:51,210
丟了一個人就乾淨了
A missing person isn't clean.

596
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:53,810
你本想殺一人卻殃及了五個人
Christ's sakes, man. You only had to kill
one goddamn person.

597
00:45:53,830 --> 00:45:55,310
這就是你說的乾淨 我說的是不露馬腳
You tapped five! You call that clean?

598
00:45:55,330 --> 00:45:59,510
他們找的是射手 不是靶子
l call it done. They're looking
at the shooter, not the target.

599
00:45:59,670 --> 00:46:00,760
上帝
Jesus.

600
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:04,840
現在事情一團糟 以後不能再亂了
We make it messy now
so it won't get messy later.

601
00:46:04,920 --> 00:46:08,100
我們不能留下任何問題
And we don't leave
questions unanswered ever.

602
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:11,270
永久不留 好吧 我搞定
Okay, all right. Okay. l can fix this.

603
00:46:11,680 --> 00:46:14,030
-睜開你的眼睛
- 不 我沒看你
-Open your eyes.
-No, l ain't seeing you!

604
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:16,110
現在無所謂了
lt makes no difference now.

605
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:27,120
我犯錯了
l made a mistake.

606
00:46:27,950 --> 00:46:29,870
我還有用 告訴我怎麼做
l mean, you can still use me,
 just tell me how to fix...

607
00:46:29,950 --> 00:46:33,800
要活命就別說搞不定 因為你搞不定
To survive.
Don't say "fix it," because you can't.

608
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,120
我們剛清理完一個亂攤子 
你又弄出來一個
We covered up the one mess.
You made another.

609
00:46:37,290 --> 00:46:38,960
好 你說得對
All right. You're right.

610
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:40,540
真的沒錯 對不起
You're right.
You're absolutely right. l'm sorry.

611
00:46:40,630 --> 00:46:43,300
告訴我怎麼做
Just tell me what l have to do.

612
00:46:44,550 --> 00:46:47,050
我在西伯利亞的監獄中呆過
l was in prison in Siberia.

613
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:51,140
我穿著死人的衣服 度過了嚴冬
l spent my first winter
wearing a dead man's coat.

614
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:53,640
口袋破了
A hole in one pocket.

615
00:46:54,140 --> 00:46:55,980
為了不讓凍傷變成壞疽
l chewed these fingers off

616
00:46:56,060 --> 00:46:59,150
我就吃掉了這幾個指頭
before the frostbite
could turn to gangrene.

617
00:47:01,310 --> 00:47:05,160
這幾個是為了逃避到硫礦勞動吃掉的
These l gave up
to avoid working in the sulphur mine.

618
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,990
就這樣 我活了下來
而許多人死了
That is how l survived
when so many others did not.

619
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:14,660
像我這樣的人 總會有用武之地
A man this rare can always be of use.

620
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,170
做給我看 讓我看看你有多堅強
So show me. Show me you are rare.

621
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,420
讓我看看為了生存 你會做任何事
Show me you'll do anything to survive.

622
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,470
我不明白
l don't understand.

623
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:28,510
吃掉你左手的手指
The fingers from your left hand.

624
00:47:53,870 --> 00:47:57,340
你有刀嗎
Have you... Have you got a knife?

625
00:47:57,540 --> 00:48:00,130
我在西伯利亞里沒有刀
Did l have a knife in Siberia?

626
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,470
算了吧 你在和我開玩笑
No... Come on, you've got to be kidding.

627
00:48:07,210 --> 00:48:08,640
你辦得到
You can do it.

628
00:48:09,050 --> 00:48:10,390
做給我看
Show me.

629
00:48:42,250 --> 00:48:43,590
天吶
Christ!

630
00:48:44,580 --> 00:48:46,880
不能 我不能
Can't! l can't.

631
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:49,130
我真不明白
Always the bullet.

632
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,890
還得用子彈
-l can't!
-l don't understand.

633
00:48:58,100 --> 00:48:59,770
我們怎麼處理那個大兵
What do we do about the soldier?

634
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:02,060
老辦法
What we always do.

635
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:10,820
巴爾的信用卡對帳單 
目擊證人證詞 咖啡
Barr's credit card statement.
Eyewitness testimonies.

636
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:14,290
沒加牛奶吧
Coffee. You take it black, right?

637
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:22,630
我能說什麼 我在家裡工作
Yeah. What can l say?
l take my work home.

638
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:39,100
巴爾的信用卡對帳單是個死胡同
Afraid Barr's credit card
statement's a dead end.

639
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:44,060
沒有酒吧, 沒有脫衣舞俱樂部
只有汽油和雜貨店的帳單
No bars, no strip joints, nothing.
Pretty much just gas and groceries.

640
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,620
從這開始找  50到100英里內的射擊場
l need you to look for gun ranges
between 100 and 150 miles from here.

641
00:49:50,150 --> 00:49:52,650
只找300碼以上射擊距離的射擊場
Limit your search to ranges
longer than 300 yards.

642
00:49:52,780 --> 00:49:54,070
可以 你能告訴我為什麼
Sure, if you tell me why.

643
00:49:54,150 --> 00:49:56,660
巴爾一直都在星期六給汽車加滿油
Barr consistently filled
his tank on Saturday,

644
00:49:56,780 --> 00:49:58,000
星期天再加滿一次
and again on Sunday.

645
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,760
說明週末是長途旅行
He took a long drive
almost every weekend.

646
00:49:59,990 --> 00:50:02,090
- 他可能去任何地方
- 是的
-He could be going anywhere.
-Yes.

647
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,170
而且如果是酒吧 球場或脫衣舞俱樂部俱樂部
我們永遠不會找它
And if it's bars, bowling alleys
or strip clubs, we'll never find it.

648
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,630
比賽用的射擊場呢
But a Match-level gun range?
There might be two.

649
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:13,510
原因有兩個 他自己做子彈
或者練習射擊
And he made his own bullets.
That means he shot a lot.

650
00:50:14,340 --> 00:50:16,010
我猜測每個星期六都要來
l'm guessing every Saturday.

651
00:50:17,180 --> 00:50:18,600
也許和一位朋友來
Maybe with a friend.

652
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:21,430
為什麼和他的朋友談話那麼重要
Why is it so important
you talk to his friends?

653
00:50:21,510 --> 00:50:22,640
如果他有朋友
Assuming he had any.

654
00:50:22,850 --> 00:50:24,350
在汽車配件商店停一下
Drop me at the auto parts store.

655
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:26,320
等等 哪家
l... Wait. Which one?

656
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:28,850
她說的那家汽車配件商店
l don't know.
She just said "the auto parts store."

657
00:50:28,940 --> 00:50:29,990
她 誰
She? Who?

658
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,610
你能說具體點嗎
Reacher, can you be
a little more specific?

659
00:50:31,690 --> 00:50:34,030
我沒說任何汽車配件商店
l didn't say "an auto parts store."

660
00:50:34,360 --> 00:50:37,660
你記憶中哪家配件商店最有名
Which one stands out in your mind
as the auto parts store?

661
00:50:47,370 --> 00:50:48,880
需要我等你嗎
You want me to wait?

662
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,120
不用 我一會去辦公室找你 你怎麼去
-No, l'll meet you back atthe office later.
-How will you get there?

663
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,180
我搭車去
l'll hitch a ride.

664
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:41,930
你要買什麼
Can l help you?

665
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:43,310
桑迪在這裡上班嗎
Sandy work here?

666
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:46,690
你有什麼事
What's this about?

667
00:51:47,430 --> 00:51:49,940
我有話和她說 是私事
So she does, thanks.
l need to speak with her.

668
00:51:50,060 --> 00:51:51,440
她在工作
lt's a personal matter.

669
00:51:52,060 --> 00:51:54,910
合法工作
-She's on the clock.
-Legal personal matter.

670
00:51:56,070 --> 00:51:57,240
長官 你要幹什麼
What are you, a cop?

671
00:51:58,780 --> 00:52:00,400
叫她出來
Call her out, Gary.

672
00:52:00,740 --> 00:52:03,080
加裡 有證件嗎 叫桑迪
-l'm gonna need to see some l.D.
-Go get Sandy.

673
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,620
好吧 我要看你的證件
Well, l need to see something.

674
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,750
你想躺救護車裡嗎
How about the inside of an ambulance?

675
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,760
好 我報警
Okay, l'm calling the police.

676
00:52:17,460 --> 00:52:19,470
我想桑迪不想讓警察參與此事
l don't think Sandy wants
the police involved...

677
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:20,804
-Hello?
-...but let's ask.

678
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,100
嗨  你
Hey! You...

679
00:52:22,300 --> 00:52:25,310
哈羅  我需要一些幫忙
Hello? l need some help.
Hello? Hey! You!

680
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:29,350
你 後面不允許去
No. You are not allowed
back in here, man!

681
00:52:35,440 --> 00:52:36,610
該死
Shit.

682
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,330
你認識這個人嗎
You know this guy?

683
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:42,660
告訴他
Tell him.

684
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,290
你先出去 加裡
Give us a few, Gary.

685
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,050
聽著 我不是  我不知道
Listen, l wasn't... l didn't know.

686
00:53:00,170 --> 00:53:02,720
我不知道會發生那樣的事
l didn't know that was going to happen!

687
00:53:08,510 --> 00:53:09,560
都怪傑布
lt was Jeb.

688
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:12,350
那個大個子
The big guy.

689
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,360
傑布-奧利沃
Jeb Oliver.

690
00:53:17,190 --> 00:53:21,660
他告訴我你是個猛男 
我以為你能上勾
He told me you were a predator.
You were supposed to start groping me.

691
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:29,670
別傷害我
Just don't hurt me.

692
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:32,210
桑迪 坐下
Sandy, sit down.

693
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:36,340
我到哪能找到傑布
Where can l find Jeb?

694
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,560
我不知道 他今天沒來上班
l don't know.
He didn't come to work today.

695
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,880
他在這兒上班
So he works here.

696
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:41,550
是的
Yeah.

697
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,560
他販賣冰毒 是個瘋子
lt's bullshit, though. He cooks crystal.

698
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,100
把他地址寫下來
His address, write it down.

699
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:51,890
真的很抱歉 先生
l'm really sorry, mister.

700
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,570
你是個坐懷不亂的人
You were supposed to be a pervert.

701
00:53:57,230 --> 00:53:59,230
我差點賺到100元
And it was an easy 100 bucks.

702
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:00,570
就那麼點兒嗎
That's all?

703
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:06,700
傑布讓我做 我就得按他說的做
When Jeb asks, you do what he says.

704
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:12,590
我有麻煩嗎
Am l in trouble?

705
00:54:15,710 --> 00:54:17,420
把你的車借給我就沒麻煩
Not if you lend me your car.

706
00:54:18,210 --> 00:54:20,630
- 我沒有車
- 你當然有 就在外面
-l don't have a car.
-Well, sure you do. lt's outside.

707
00:54:21,550 --> 00:54:22,790
我猜那輛卡瑪洛是你的
l'm guessing you're the Camaro.

708
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,720
把那輛小皮卡借給我
That whimsy little pickup
has Gary written all over it. Keys?

709
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:28,260
我不能 那是傑布的車
l can't. lt's Jeb's car!

710
00:54:28,470 --> 00:54:31,640
我把車開到他家去
他是不會感到驚訝的
Well, won't he be surprised
when l drive it home for him.

711
00:54:38,730 --> 00:54:40,110
你是什麼人 先生
Who are you, mister?

712
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:41,780
真的嗎
Really?

713
00:54:48,610 --> 00:54:51,240
我只是一個不願意被打擾的人
l'm just a guy
who wants to be left alone.

714
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:53,250
我六點下班
l get off work at six!

715
00:54:56,790 --> 00:54:58,510
也許我們可以
Maybe we could...

716
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:00,630
桑迪 聽著
Sandy, listen.

717
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:04,090
你是個可愛女孩
Now, you seem like a sweet girl.

718
00:55:05,090 --> 00:55:06,430
你很漂亮
You're pretty.

719
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:08,930
聰明
You're obviously sharp,

720
00:55:09,090 --> 00:55:10,640
給加裡管帳
doing Gary's books for him.

721
00:55:11,640 --> 00:55:13,940
你不能讓這些傢伙利用你
You don't have to
let these guys use you.

722
00:55:16,930 --> 00:55:19,480
我這樣的女孩只能幹這個
lt's just what girls like me do.

723
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:24,780
你有錢嗎
You got money?

724
00:55:26,110 --> 00:55:27,160
有一點
A little.

725
00:55:28,450 --> 00:55:29,990
你要出城幾天
Get out of town for a couple of days.

726
00:55:30,490 --> 00:55:31,540
為什麼
Why?

727
00:55:33,830 --> 00:55:35,670
去外地 桑迪
Get out of town, Sandy.

728
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,420
傑布在家嗎
ls Jeb home?

729
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:30,430
我有房屋搜查令
l have a warrant to search the premises.

730
00:56:36,560 --> 00:56:37,900
知道了
l see.

731
00:56:40,020 --> 00:56:41,560
好吧 如果你不介意
Well, if you don't mind...

732
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,528
Get him! Get him! Get him!

733
00:59:00,240 --> 00:59:01,910
我有這個
l got this!

734
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:03,040
好吧
Okay, okay.

735
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:05,660
好
All right.

736
01:00:05,470 --> 01:00:06,820
不許動
Don't move.

737
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:08,820
我告訴你
l'll tell you what.

738
01:00:09,480 --> 01:00:12,100
我要是動 你就開槍
When l move, you pull the trigger.

739
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,700
- 傑布在哪
- 他不在這裡
-Where's Jeb?
-He's not here.

740
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:19,120
我在哪能找到他
Where can l find him?

741
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,740
我的手
Jesus! My hand!

742
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:23,060
你不該玩槍
我在哪能找到他
Well, you shouldn't play with guns.
Where can l find him?

743
01:00:23,240 --> 01:00:26,160
你開他的車 應該你告訴我才對
You're the one driving his car. You tell...

744
01:00:26,830 --> 01:00:29,130
我上次見到他 是出獄那天
The last l saw him,
we was all leaving jail.

745
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:30,750
他說他必須見一個人
He said he had to see a guy.

746
01:00:30,910 --> 01:00:32,590
- 什麼人 誰
- 我不知道
-What guy? Who?
-l don't know.

747
01:00:32,750 --> 01:00:34,090
我不知道 我發誓
l don't know, l swear.

748
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:36,680
他媽媽吸多了
Next l know,
his mom woke up from a bender

749
01:00:36,750 --> 01:00:37,970
他醒來後所有的東西就都丟了
and his shit's all gone.

750
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,430
他是那種不辭而別的人嗎
ls he the sort to light out like that?

751
01:00:40,590 --> 01:00:43,090
不是 他從來不丟下他媽媽不管
No, no, man.
He'd never leave his moms alone.

752
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:44,430
這事有點不對勁
Shit ain't right.

753
01:00:44,510 --> 01:00:46,260
- 你有車嗎
- 在外面
-Got a car?
-lt's outside.

754
01:00:46,510 --> 01:00:47,560
鑰匙
Keys.

755
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,360
我的手
在我口袋裡
My hand, man. They're in my pock...

756
01:00:49,520 --> 01:00:50,860
好 好
Okay, okay.

757
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:59,370
看看你的朋友
Now look at your friends.

758
01:00:59,940 --> 01:01:01,160
現在看我的臉
Now look at my face.

759
01:01:03,030 --> 01:01:05,200
還想見我嗎
Do you ever want to see me again?

760
01:01:05,950 --> 01:01:07,040
決不
No way.

761
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:10,040
我在偷你的汽車嗎
Am l stealing your car?

762
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:14,340
你想用多久都行
Use it as long as you like.

763
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:17,000
你真講究
You're very kind.

764
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:18,380
啊

765
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:43,950
我認為傑布已經死了
l think Jeb Oliver's dead.

766
01:01:44,490 --> 01:01:47,490
- 誰是傑布 
- 酒吧裡那傢伙
-Who's Jeb Oliver?
-He was the guy from the bar.

767
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:51,420
天啊 你把他打成什麼樣了
Jesus, how hard did you hit him?

768
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:54,590
不是我
What? No, not me.

769
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,040
是他殺
No, he was murdered.

770
01:01:57,130 --> 01:01:59,000
兇手想造成他離開城裡的假象
And someone tried to make it
look like he left town.

771
01:01:59,090 --> 01:02:00,590
也許他真是走了
Well, maybe he just left town.

772
01:02:00,670 --> 01:02:02,430
旅行還把浴簾裝到行李中嗎
You pack your shower curtain
when you travel?

773
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,640
這是你的結論嗎
ls this what you base
your conclusions on?

774
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,510
你頭怎麼了
What is that on your head?

775
01:02:13,180 --> 01:02:14,560
你不會想知道的
You don't want to know.

776
01:02:16,980 --> 01:02:19,530
你想提交你的調查結果
You said on the phone
you wanted to submit your findings.

777
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:25,450
詹姆斯-巴爾 是個狙擊手
不是最好, 也不是最差的
James Barr was a sniper.
Not the best, not the worst.

778
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,450
但是受過兩年訓練
But he trained non-stop for two years.

779
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:28,810
這種訓練能起什麼作用
What does training like that do?

780
01:02:28,950 --> 01:02:30,830
任何訓練都有作用
What does any training do?

781
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:33,790
技術變成反射 肌肉記憶
你不用思考
Skills become reflex. Muscle memory.
You do without thinking.

782
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,470
把戰術灌給他們
lt also makes people who aren't
necessarily smart seem smart

783
01:02:37,710 --> 01:02:39,960
使不聰明的人看上去很聰明
by beating some
tactical awareness into them.

784
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:42,460
99%的證據指控巴爾
Now, 99% of the evidence
your father has against Barr

785
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,140
在巴格達都沒有發現
didn't exist in Baghdad,

786
01:02:44,210 --> 01:02:47,180
不是因為巴爾聰明
而是因為他受過訓練
not because Barr was smart,
but because he was trained.

787
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:51,390
在那個停車場開槍
射手的眼睛會受到陽光照射
See, from that garage,
the shooter had the sun in his eyes.

788
01:02:51,550 --> 01:02:54,650
目標左右移動
對任何射手來說 都很難擊中
Targets were moving left and right.
lt's difficult conditions for any sniper.

789
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,400
但是在巴格達 巴爾在停車場裡
But Baghdad, you said Barr
was in a parking garage then.

790
01:02:57,480 --> 01:03:00,200
因為在巴格達 太陽照在他背後
Because in Baghdad,
the sun's behind him.

791
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,150
目標是從正前方過來 列成一隊
Targets coming straight ahead,
single file.

792
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,030
對普通射手來說 這是最理想的條件
ldeal conditions
for even an average shooter

793
01:03:07,070 --> 01:03:08,820
同樣的條件
and the exact same conditions

794
01:03:08,990 --> 01:03:11,370
他在高速公路橋上也能找到
he would've had
up on that highway bridge.

795
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:15,460
在橋上 他甚至都不用下車
Up there, he would never even
have to get out of the van.

796
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,470
沒有停車計時器
No parking meter.

797
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,710
沒有攝像頭
No camera.

798
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:24,220
不會留下任何作案痕跡
No trace evidence left behind.
And his escape is assured.

799
01:03:24,340 --> 01:03:26,010
能輕鬆地逃走
Now, l'm not saying
that he couldn't have killed

800
01:03:26,090 --> 01:03:28,510
他不可能在河邊殺死那些人
those people at the river,
but he wouldn't have.

801
01:03:28,590 --> 01:03:29,640
他不會用這種方式干
Not that way.

802
01:03:29,720 --> 01:03:31,190
-那麼 你是說他瘋了 
-不是
-So you're saying he's crazy.
-No.

803
01:03:31,260 --> 01:03:33,260
那你是什麼意思
Well, what exactly are you saying?

804
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:37,020
我相信任何證據
Any single piece of evidence l'd buy.
But all of it?

805
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,730
纖維 指紋 飛走的彈殼 連起來呢
Fibres, fingerprints, stray brass,
l mean...

806
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,810
究竟是誰付的停車費
And who the hell pays for parking?

807
01:03:42,020 --> 01:03:44,700
神志是否正常
Sane or crazy,
that just doesn't make sense.

808
01:03:44,770 --> 01:03:49,450
這都解釋不通 巴爾想讓人抓住她
Okay. So Barr, he wanted to get caught
and he wanted you to catch him.

809
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,370
-他想讓你去抓他
-這也解釋不了
That would not explain how Barr,

810
01:03:53,370 --> 01:03:57,620
巴爾怎麼會在那種情況下開槍
an average shooter firing
in poor conditions, never missed.

811
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:58,960
而且還沒有失手
He did miss.

812
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:00,590
他失手了
He did.

813
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:04,930
嶄新的子彈
A pristine bullet,

814
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:08,350
留在被擊中的液體中
conveniently trapped
by a liquid backstop.

815
01:04:10,340 --> 01:04:12,890
同樣的子彈從巴爾的槍射擊遇害者
The same bullet that tied
Barr's gun to the killings.

816
01:04:13,510 --> 01:04:16,860
作為起訴書中重要證據是有爭議的
And arguably the prosecution's single
most important piece of evidence.

817
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:20,570
如果巴爾想被抓住 他為何沒有失手
lf Barr wanted to get caught,
he didn't miss.

818
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:22,550
這解釋不通
Either way, it doesn't make sense.

819
01:04:22,730 --> 01:04:25,070
如果他想逃 早就逃了
lf he wanted to get away with it,
he likely would have

820
01:04:25,190 --> 01:04:26,860
如果他想被人抓住
and if he wanted to get caught,

821
01:04:27,190 --> 01:04:29,790
巴爾不可能做到這麼完美
Barr was incapable of such perfection.

822
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,820
-或者說他運氣很好 6槍6中
Or maybe he just got lucky,
six shots out of six.

823
01:04:32,030 --> 01:04:34,080
直到這些傢伙抓住我之前
That's what l was willing to accept,

824
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:36,120
我願意接受這個觀點
then those guys took a run at me.

825
01:04:36,580 --> 01:04:38,700
他們用錯了人
Whoever sent them made a mistake.

826
01:04:38,910 --> 01:04:41,260
那只是酒吧鬥毆而已
lt was just a bar fight.

827
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,710
也許
Maybe.

828
01:04:43,750 --> 01:04:46,590
或者是有人害怕了 想把我嚇走
Or maybe someone got nervous,
tried to run me off.

829
01:04:47,090 --> 01:04:51,390
或者把我打昏
Or put me in a coma,
right next to their patsy.

830
01:04:54,260 --> 01:04:55,760
放在容易受騙的人身邊
Patsy?

831
01:04:57,100 --> 01:04:59,730
這麼完美的犯罪現場
lt was such a great crime scene.

832
01:04:59,810 --> 01:05:01,780
簡直太完美了
No one stopped to think
it might be too great.

833
01:05:02,230 --> 01:05:03,400
愛默生沒想
Not Emerson.

834
01:05:03,560 --> 01:05:05,230
你父親也沒想
Not your father.

835
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,950
甚至你也沒想
Not even Barr's own defence attorney.

836
01:05:09,610 --> 01:05:11,280
都認為巴爾有罪
But Barr knew l would,

837
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,620
巴爾知道我會懷疑
no matter how much
l wanted it to be true.

838
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,330
那就是他為什麼要見我
That's why he asked for me.

839
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,290
等等
Wait.

840
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,670
你是說
Are you suggesting...

841
01:05:23,750 --> 01:05:25,920
詹姆斯-巴爾 是無辜的
James Barr is innocent.

842
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:37,100
你知道這是什麼想法嗎
You can see what this is, can't you?

843
01:05:38,140 --> 01:05:39,610
你接這個案子
You've got a case in your hands

844
01:05:39,680 --> 01:05:41,810
也許是你最後一個
that may be
the last case you'll ever have

845
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:45,780
你卻想方設法不結案
and you'll do anything
not to hit the bottom of it.

846
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,610
海倫
Helen.

847
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:51,450
海倫 你就不該退役
You know,
you never should have retired.

848
01:05:51,650 --> 01:05:53,150
聽著
Just, look. Listen.

849
01:05:53,320 --> 01:05:54,740
據我所知 三天前
For all l know, you were
standing at an intersection

850
01:05:54,820 --> 01:05:56,300
你還舉牌子站在十字路口
with a cardboard sign three days ago.

851
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,620
而我竟然僱用了你
我的父親是正確的
And l hired you.
Jesus, my father was right.

852
01:05:59,160 --> 01:06:01,790
- 海倫 海倫
- 現在全明白了
-Helen. Helen.
-lt makes total sense now.

853
01:06:01,950 --> 01:06:03,710
海倫 你那種生活方式 到處遊蕩
lt's the way you live,
the way you move around.

854
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:06,460
你不適應現實生活 是嗎
You're just not cut out
for the real world, are you?

855
01:06:06,790 --> 01:06:08,040
你害怕會有巴爾那樣的下場
Are you afraid you'll end up like Barr?

856
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,370
-海倫
-這是什麼
-Helen.
-ls that what this is?

857
01:06:09,460 --> 01:06:10,510
看看窗外
Look out the window.

858
01:06:10,670 --> 01:06:11,970
不我要工作要做你快走吧
No, l have work to do.

859
01:06:12,050 --> 01:06:13,300
來吧
-And you need to leave.
-Just humour me. Okay.

860
01:06:13,840 --> 01:06:14,890
放開我
Let go of me.

861
01:06:16,510 --> 01:06:18,480
告訴我你見到了什麼
-Would you tell me what you see?
-l see the same

862
01:06:19,850 --> 01:06:22,140
我每天看過的東西
things l see every day.

863
01:06:22,350 --> 01:06:24,350
好吧 設想一下你從沒見過這些
Well, imagine you've never seen it.

864
01:06:25,850 --> 01:06:28,860
想像你是在另一個地方度過人生
lmagine you've spent your whole life
in other parts of the world

865
01:06:29,190 --> 01:06:31,690
你為自由而戰
being told every day
you're defending freedom.

866
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:34,160
你終於無法忍受了
And finally
you decide you've had enough.

867
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:38,250
看看你為之奮鬥的是什麼
Time to see
what you've given up your whole life for.

868
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:40,950
為自己爭取一些自由
Maybe get some of that freedom
for yourself.

869
01:06:42,700 --> 01:06:44,120
看看這些人
Look at the people.

870
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,710
現在告訴我哪個是自由的
Now tell me which ones are free.

871
01:06:49,290 --> 01:06:50,970
沒債的
Free from debt.

872
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,630
焦慮
Anxiety.

873
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:53,960
壓力
Stress.

874
01:06:54,050 --> 01:06:55,300
恐懼
Fear.

875
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:59,060
失敗 侮辱 背叛
Failure. lndignity. Betrayal.

876
01:07:01,550 --> 01:07:04,560
人們都希望生來就知道現在的事
How many wish they were born
knowing what they know now?

877
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,810
問問自己 有多少人願意
Ask yourself how many would do things

878
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,570
反覆做同一件事
the same way all over again?

879
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:12,020
有多少人願意像我這樣生活
And how many would
live their lives like me?

880
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,200
看看對面街上的那輛奧迪車
Now look at the silver Audi
across the street,

881
01:07:18,280 --> 01:07:20,250
整天都在跟蹤我
the one that's been following me all day.

882
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:21,920
那能證明什麼
What does that prove?

883
01:07:21,990 --> 01:07:25,420
這是車牌號 多久能查出車主
Here's the tag number.
How long would it take you to run it?

884
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:28,000
晚上 我不確定 一小時
At this time of night?
l don't know. An hour?

885
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:29,210
查吧
Do it.

886
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,510
查到後 我就離開
Do it, and then l'll leave.

887
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:42,930
什麼時候
When?

888
01:07:45,930 --> 01:07:50,190
不 這現在是我的問題 我來解決
No, this is my problem now.
l'll handle it.

889
01:07:52,190 --> 01:07:53,310
是的
Yeah?

890
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:56,530
你暴露了
You're blown.

891
01:07:57,030 --> 01:07:59,280
律師正在查車牌
The lawyer's running the licence plates.

892
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,120
是的
Yeah. So do it?

893
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:04,910
完成了
Done.

894
01:08:07,620 --> 01:08:09,290
去這個住址
Go to this address.

895
01:08:11,790 --> 01:08:14,420
好吧 假如巴爾沒幹這事
All right, let's just say
that Barr didn't do it.

896
01:08:14,540 --> 01:08:16,390
或是有人指使他幹的
Or did it 'cause someone
put him up to it.

897
01:08:16,460 --> 01:08:17,660
你有什麼證據
Either way, what have you got?

898
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:18,810
是陰謀
Conspiracy.

899
01:08:18,880 --> 01:08:20,680
預謀殺死五個平民百姓 沒有動機
Yeah, conspiracy to kill
five random people?

900
01:08:20,760 --> 01:08:22,060
很荒唐 是嗎
There's no motive.

901
01:08:22,140 --> 01:08:24,480
荒唐的有點離譜
-lt's ridiculous, right?
-lt's grassy knoll ludicrous.

902
01:08:24,640 --> 01:08:26,390
進一步調查沒有意義了
No point looking any further.

903
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:27,980
沒錯
Exactly.

904
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:29,610
說得對
Exactly.

905
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:34,570
這是什麼
What's this?

906
01:08:34,730 --> 01:08:36,830
殺人動機
The motive. Just hold onto it.

907
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,120
我們在玩什麼 猜迷遊戲
What are we playing, Clue?

908
01:08:39,991 --> 01:08:41,159
Yeah?

909
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,830
給我
Give it to me.

910
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,210
謝謝
Thank you.

911
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:09,770
你確信那輛汽車跟了你一天嗎
You sure
that car was following you all day?

912
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,860
你接上 我就開始
As soon as you picked me up. Why?

913
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:21,950
這輛車屬於樂班德爾公司
lt's registered to a company
called Lebendauer Enterprises.

914
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:35,880
預謀殺死五個平民
A conspiracy to kill five random people?

915
01:09:37,210 --> 01:09:38,710
荒唐
That's ridiculous.

916
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:42,560
四個
Four.

917
01:09:44,050 --> 01:09:45,890
四個平民
Four random people.

918
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,520
為了掩蓋一個特定的目標
To hide one specific target.

919
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:17,210
有人想要奧賴恩-阿徹的建築生意
Someone needed
Oline Archer's construction business.

920
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,300
而奧賴恩不願意交出項目
And Oline wouldn't let it go.

921
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:34,810
這是一個合理的假設
lt's a convincing theory.

922
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:39,490
但是只是一個假設
But it's just a theory.

923
01:10:40,820 --> 01:10:45,320
第一槍射擊是最不準確的
The first round is the least accurate.
The snipers call it a cold shot.

924
01:10:45,570 --> 01:10:47,660
狙擊手稱之為冷射
你的目擊證人描述說
Meanwhile, your eyewitness
described a pause

925
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,080
第一槍和第二槍之間有停頓
between the first and second rounds.

926
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:53,080
第二槍射手很深穩
The one shot where the killer
took his time.

927
01:10:53,330 --> 01:10:55,920
奧賴恩-阿徹是第二個遇害者
And Oline Archer
was the second victim.

928
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,840
這一槍 至關重要
The one shot that mattered.

929
01:11:00,670 --> 01:11:02,300
這還只是猜測
But it's just a theory.

930
01:11:03,670 --> 01:11:05,420
這是根據巴爾習慣而設的圈套
This frame was custom made for Barr.

931
01:11:06,340 --> 01:11:08,220
選中他的人瞭解巴格達的事
Whoever chose him
knew about Baghdad

932
01:11:08,300 --> 01:11:09,970
而能講出這件事的人
and the only one who could have
told him about Baghdad

933
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:11,600
只有巴爾他自己
was Barr himself.

934
01:11:11,680 --> 01:11:15,180
他至少會有一朋友 非常親密的朋友
He has at least one friend.
A very close one.

935
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:17,860
找到他 才能找真正的兇手
Now, you find that friend,
you'll find the real shooter.

936
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:19,600
找到真正的兇手 雷徹
Find the real shooter? Reacher,

937
01:11:19,690 --> 01:11:22,530
我的工作是向陪審團提出合理質疑
my job is to present the jury
with reasonable doubt. Period.

938
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:24,110
-要抓那些壞人 把他們繩之以法
-讓他們接受法律制裁
What about catching the guys
who really did this?

939
01:11:24,197 --> 01:11:26,282
-Catching the guys who did this?
-Bringing them to justice?

940
01:11:26,360 --> 01:11:28,520
- 不 我不能拿這到法院
- 揭開事實真相
-No, l can't take this to court.
-Exposing the truth.

941
01:11:28,530 --> 01:11:32,200
即使我相信巴爾是無辜的
Even if l believed Barr is innocent,
it's not my job.

942
01:11:33,030 --> 01:11:36,710
那不是我的工作 
我只是一個律師而不是警察
l am just a lawyer. l'm not a cop.

943
01:11:39,870 --> 01:11:41,880
而且坦白說 你也不是
And frankly, neither are you.

944
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,720
我不能再這樣做
l can't do this any more.

945
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:54,440
謝謝你的咖啡 大律師
Thanks for the coffee, counsellor.

946
01:12:30,220 --> 01:12:31,390
桑迪
Sandy?

947
01:12:34,930 --> 01:12:36,400
等等 是桑迪 不是嗎
Wait, it is Sandy, isn't it?

948
01:12:38,600 --> 01:12:39,650
我認識你嗎
Do l know you?

949
01:12:41,440 --> 01:12:44,150
查理 傑布的朋友?
Charlie. Jeb's friend?

950
01:12:44,690 --> 01:12:46,410
太讓我傷心了
Oh, come on, don't break my heart.

951
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:49,030
對不起 我不記得
l'm sorry, l don't remember.

952
01:12:50,110 --> 01:12:51,990
我們當時都喝高了
Well, we were both pretty wasted.

953
01:12:53,660 --> 01:12:54,750
哦 對

954
01:12:55,997 --> 01:12:57,039
Yeah.

955
01:12:58,950 --> 01:13:01,800
- 什麼 你住在這兒
- 就在這樓上 真巧
-What, you live here?
-Just up there.

956
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:03,462
No shit.

957
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,170
我剛剛搬到那後面住
l just moved in around the back!
How crazy is that?

958
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:09,010
難以置信 有趣
lt's wild.

959
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:10,140
是啊
Yeah.

960
01:13:11,470 --> 01:13:14,970
哇 你真漂亮
Wow! You look great.

961
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,100
謝謝
Thanks.

962
01:13:18,140 --> 01:13:21,360
聽著 我不想耽誤你的時間
Well, look, you know,
l don't want to keep you, so...

963
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:23,030
也許我們可以找個時間喝一杯
Maybe we can grab a drink sometime.

964
01:13:23,140 --> 01:13:24,570
是的  也許
Yeah, maybe.

965
01:13:25,980 --> 01:13:27,400
今晚怎麼樣
Hey, how about tonight?

966
01:13:28,730 --> 01:13:30,450
我約了人
l'm meeting some people.

967
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:34,200
好吧
Okay. Well, some other time, then.

968
01:13:34,490 --> 01:13:35,830
那就改天吧
Some other time.

969
01:13:35,910 --> 01:13:37,000
在這裡動手
Do it here.

970
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,160
什麼
What?

971
01:14:20,530 --> 01:14:21,710
雷徹
Reacher!

972
01:14:37,050 --> 01:14:40,730
俄亥俄州有個射擊場
目標距離700碼
There's a gun range in Ohio,
targets out to 700 yards.

973
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:43,900
唯一符合你要求的場地
The only range
that matches your requirements.

974
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:49,980
你應該睡一會
You should sleep.

975
01:14:51,730 --> 01:14:53,150
明天要開長途
You have a long drive tomorrow,

976
01:14:53,230 --> 01:14:55,910
我要查一下奧賴恩
and l need to go to city hall
and pull up Oline's legal history.

977
01:14:57,740 --> 01:15:00,910
先別那樣做
l wouldn't do that. Not till l get back.

978
01:15:01,410 --> 01:15:04,210
等我回來再說 如果我是對的
有人殺了四個平民
lf l'm right,
someone killed four random people

979
01:15:04,290 --> 01:15:06,460
目的不是讓調查員去查奧賴恩
so no one would look directly at Oline.

980
01:15:06,830 --> 01:15:10,340
如果我分析得對
只要提他的名字 你就會送命
And if l'm right, just saying her name
could get you killed.

981
01:15:10,420 --> 01:15:13,170
- 你認為我會害怕嗎
- 你很聰明 那不是明擺著的嗎
-You saying l should be scared?
-Well, are you smart?

982
01:15:13,670 --> 01:15:14,720
顯然
Obviously.

983
01:15:14,920 --> 01:15:16,170
那就不用害怕
Then don't be scared.

984
01:15:48,960 --> 01:15:51,130
到底要我找什麼
What exactly am l looking for?

985
01:15:51,630 --> 01:15:54,800
殺死這個女孩的人
Someone who could kill that girl
with one punch.

986
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,310
你要的人在1109室
Oh, you want the guy in 1109.

987
01:15:59,130 --> 01:16:00,640
厄尼-約翰遜
Ernie Johnson.

988
01:16:02,220 --> 01:16:03,270
你要看看嗎
You'll see.

989
01:17:28,890 --> 01:17:30,440
快下車
Out of the car!

990
01:17:37,400 --> 01:17:40,240
他是我們要抓的嫌疑犯 快跑
That's our suspect! Move, move!

991
01:18:01,760 --> 01:18:04,180
疑犯在65號公路向北行駛
Suspect is headed north
on State Route 65.

992
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:05,850
我需要增援和空中支援
l need backup and air support.

993
01:23:38,130 --> 01:23:39,480
等一下
Hold up!

994
01:23:39,840 --> 01:23:41,190
沒有人
All clear!

995
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:06,040
哦 天吶 
我就是不敢相信 不敢相信
Oh, God,
l just don't believe it. l don't believe it!

996
01:24:06,160 --> 01:24:07,790
我剛簽發了逮捕令
l issued the warrant an hour ago.

997
01:24:07,870 --> 01:24:09,290
有人看到雷徹
According to the victim's boss,

998
01:24:09,370 --> 01:24:11,050
今天去了她的商店
Reacher was seen at her
place of work this morning.

999
01:24:11,330 --> 01:24:12,800
他還威脅她老闆
Where he threatened her boss.

1000
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,880
他開的是傑布-奧利沃朋友的車
The car he was driving tonight
belonged to a friend of Jeb Oliver's.

1001
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,130
他打了那個人
The man he assaulted.

1002
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:18,970
不 是他們打了雷徹
No, those guys assaulted Reacher.

1003
01:24:19,050 --> 01:24:20,930
在傑布家
Reacher put three more men
in the hospital

1004
01:24:21,010 --> 01:24:22,490
雷徹把三個人打傷住院
this afternoon at Jeb Oliver's place.

1005
01:24:22,550 --> 01:24:24,730
是開傑布的車去的那裡
After arriving in Jeb Oliver's car.

1006
01:24:24,850 --> 01:24:27,020
傑布出院後 再也沒人看見他
And Jeb hasn't been seen
since he left the hospital.

1007
01:24:27,220 --> 01:24:29,730
如果你知道雷徹在哪  告訴我們
Helen, if you know where Reacher is,
you need to tell us.

1008
01:24:29,850 --> 01:24:31,350
我不知道 幾個小時前 
我離開辦公室後
l don't know where he is.
l have not seen him

1009
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,900
就再也沒見到他
since he left my office a few hours ago.

1010
01:24:36,020 --> 01:24:38,620
- 我認為她說是的實話
- 你認為 爸 該死
-l think she's telling the truth.
-You think, Dad? Fuck you!

1011
01:24:38,860 --> 01:24:40,830
我告訴過你不要接近他
Hey, l told you not to go near him.

1012
01:24:40,900 --> 01:24:43,330
你進入我的家就像審犯人一樣審我
You come into my home
and you treat me like l'm an accessory!

1013
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,497
-Please! You know...
-All right. All right. Come on. Enough.

1014
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:46,670
- 好了 我來處理
- 我沒說完
-Look, let me handle it.
-l'm not done.

1015
01:24:46,870 --> 01:24:47,990
你倆說完了 出去
You're both done. Just get out.

1016
01:24:53,540 --> 01:24:54,760
這是海倫
This is Helen.

1017
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:56,300
我猜警察在那裡
-l'm guessing the police are there?
-Yep.

1018
01:24:56,380 --> 01:24:57,430
是的

1019
01:24:57,550 --> 01:24:59,640
我猜不出30秒
By your response l'm guessing
l have about 30 seconds

1020
01:24:59,720 --> 01:25:00,960
他們就會要你手裡的電話
before you hand them the phone.

1021
01:25:01,050 --> 01:25:02,390
會的
lf that.

1022
01:25:02,590 --> 01:25:04,310
如果他們能陷害巴爾
lf you believe someone
could frame Barr,

1023
01:25:04,390 --> 01:25:06,760
也能陷害我
you have to believe
they could do the same to me.

1024
01:25:06,890 --> 01:25:08,560
我想有這個可能
l suppose that's possible.

1025
01:25:09,770 --> 01:25:11,770
她是一個可愛的孩子 海倫
She was a sweet kid, Helen.

1026
01:25:12,940 --> 01:25:14,940
他們是因為我 才殺死了她
And they killed her because of me.

1027
01:25:16,270 --> 01:25:17,950
他們逼我不插手此事
They want me to run.

1028
01:25:19,030 --> 01:25:20,030
我決不
But l won't.

1029
01:25:20,610 --> 01:25:23,030
-我一定要查清
-這不是個好主意
-l'm going to finish this.
-No, that's not a good idea.

1030
01:25:23,110 --> 01:25:24,210
聽好
Listen.

1031
01:25:24,410 --> 01:25:27,410
第二
Two things. One, l...

1032
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,910
我偷了你的汽車
l stole your car.

1033
01:25:30,910 --> 01:25:32,590
如果你要結束合作
lf you want to end this,

1034
01:25:32,710 --> 01:25:34,050
掛上電話報案 車丟了
just hang up the phone
and report it missing.

1035
01:25:34,120 --> 01:25:35,300
我能理解
And l'll understand.

1036
01:25:35,460 --> 01:25:36,800
還有事嗎
And anything else?

1037
01:25:37,460 --> 01:25:39,680
早點告訴你怕你接受不了
l thought l'd be pushing it
if l mentioned this earlier.

1038
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,630
我擔心發生意外
Now l guess all bets are off.

1039
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:44,930
對愛默生和你父親談話要小心
You need to watch what you say
to Emerson and your father.

1040
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,560
我認為他們的其中之一參與了此案
l think one of them is in on it.

1041
01:25:46,640 --> 01:25:48,980
好  謝謝通知 我掛了
All right. Thanks for calling. l have to go.

1042
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:51,150
等等 從第一天開始 我就被跟蹤了
Wait. l've been followed from day one.

1043
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:54,770
只有三個人知道我在這裡
Only three people knew l was here.

1044
01:25:54,940 --> 01:25:57,160
愛默生，你的父親和你
Emerson, your father and you.

1045
01:25:58,150 --> 01:26:00,030
你自己想下
You need to ask yourself,

1046
01:26:00,110 --> 01:26:01,950
幫巴爾洗清罪名 誰損失最大
who has the most to lose
if we clear Barr?

1047
01:26:03,990 --> 01:26:06,330
誰警告你要離開我
Who tried to warn you off me?

1048
01:26:07,820 --> 01:26:10,330
當然 我可能是錯誤的
如果你認為我是
Of course, l could be wrong.
lf you think l am,

1049
01:26:10,450 --> 01:26:12,080
就掛上電話
just hand over the phone.

1050
01:26:12,160 --> 01:26:13,660
進一步調查就沒有意義了
There's no sense getting any deeper.

1051
01:26:14,960 --> 01:26:16,130
你在和誰說話
Who's that you're talking to?

1052
01:26:17,170 --> 01:26:18,590
辦公室的人
The office.

1053
01:26:22,340 --> 01:26:23,810
我們談完了嗎
Are we done?

1054
01:26:24,010 --> 01:26:25,130
海倫 聽著
Helen, listen.

1055
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:26,710
-我們需要
-晚安
-We need to...
-Good night.

1056
01:27:43,920 --> 01:27:45,920
你這裡有優秀的射手嗎
You got some fine shooters here.

1057
01:27:46,590 --> 01:27:48,590
想找優秀的
Fine as frog's hair.

1058
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,270
很難
Rarer, too.

1059
01:27:50,760 --> 01:27:54,060
大多數來這兒的人 根本就不會射擊
'Cause most of them fellas out there
can't shoot worth a damn.

1060
01:27:54,600 --> 01:27:58,270
讓他們把3發子彈打中靶子
You ask them to put
three rounds in the black, well,

1061
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,610
根本打不中
they'll suck it.

1062
01:28:03,060 --> 01:28:06,410
- 我要找店主
- 我就是 馬丁-凱時
-l'm looking for the owner.
-That'd be me. Martin Cash.

1063
01:28:06,610 --> 01:28:08,110
艾倫-沃德
Aaron Ward.

1064
01:28:08,400 --> 01:28:10,370
我能為你做什麼 先生
What can l do you for,Mr Ward? Ward?

1065
01:28:10,450 --> 01:28:14,000
我正在找一位我的朋友
一起在伊拉克服過役
Yeah. l'm looking for a friend of mine.
We served in lraq.

1066
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,800
他消失了 知道嗎
The guy just dropped
off the grid, you know?

1067
01:28:16,080 --> 01:28:17,880
常有這種事
-lt happens. Yep.
-Yeah. Yeah.

1068
01:28:17,950 --> 01:28:19,250
他曾是名狙擊手
Anyway, he was a shooter.

1069
01:28:19,370 --> 01:28:20,970
最後一次聽到他的消息時 他還活著
Last l heard, he lived
around here somewhere and l...

1070
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:23,090
他什麼時候退役的
When did he get out of the Army?

1071
01:28:24,630 --> 01:28:26,300
我沒說他是軍人
Well, l didn't say the Army.

1072
01:28:26,420 --> 01:28:29,430
你說過的 你是不是鍋蓋頭
Well, you said you served with him.
You're no jarhead.

1073
01:28:29,630 --> 01:28:32,140
明眼人一眼就能看出來
Man on a flying horse could see that.

1074
01:28:32,260 --> 01:28:34,430
好吧 我的父親是海軍陸戰隊的
Well, my father was in the Corps,
if that helps.

1075
01:28:34,640 --> 01:28:37,480
這只能說明你是半個強人
Well, that makes you half human.

1076
01:28:39,100 --> 01:28:40,270
你朋友的名字
Your friend got a name?

1077
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:42,570
詹姆斯-巴爾
Yeah. James Barr.

1078
01:28:43,810 --> 01:28:45,160
詹姆斯-巴爾
James Barr.

1079
01:28:45,820 --> 01:28:47,070
沒聽過
Never heard of him.

1080
01:28:48,440 --> 01:28:49,950
我認為你有
l think you have.

1081
01:28:51,150 --> 01:28:53,000
我認為你些恐懼
l think you've been dreading the moment

1082
01:28:53,110 --> 01:28:55,160
警察來過
some cop comes in here
asking after him.

1083
01:28:55,490 --> 01:28:58,170
這讓你很恐慌
Because it's for sure
some soccer mom around here

1084
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:02,630
這附近足球媽媽更擔心你的射擊場
is more worried about your range than
she is about the pool in her backyard

1085
01:29:02,830 --> 01:29:05,300
而不是自家後院的游泳池
or the drain cleaner under her sink.

1086
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:10,180
巴爾在100英里以外殺人也沒什麼
Wouldn't matter to her
if Barr did his killing 100 miles away,

1087
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:12,130
可他是在你這兒訓練的
only that he came here to rehearse.

1088
01:29:12,260 --> 01:29:13,810
足球媽媽一紙訴狀就能讓你停業
She'd have a case to shut you down

1089
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:16,850
你會無計可施
and nothing better to do.

1090
01:29:17,810 --> 01:29:18,850
你想怎樣
What do you want?

1091
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,320
我想要知道巴爾的朋友是誰
l want to know who Barr's friends were.

1092
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:27,610
這幫傢伙
Those boys out there,

1093
01:29:28,860 --> 01:29:31,660
當你觸動他們的權利裡 他們很敏感
they're mighty touchy when it comes
to their constitutional rights.

1094
01:29:32,360 --> 01:29:35,870
告訴他們 警察問過我的會員會怎樣
Suppose l tell them a cop is in here
asking after my members?

1095
01:29:36,030 --> 01:29:37,960
- 我不是警官
- 你是作什麼的?
-l'm not a cop.
-What are you?

1096
01:29:38,030 --> 01:29:39,130
我是巴爾的律師
l work for Barr's attorney.

1097
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,050
我們有理由相信他是無辜的
We have reason to believe
he's innocent.

1098
01:29:41,160 --> 01:29:42,250
胡說 就算他是有罪
The hell you say.

1099
01:29:42,330 --> 01:29:47,050
我是唯一跑來調查他的人
Be that as it may, l'm the only one
who's bothered to track him this far.

1100
01:29:48,210 --> 01:29:51,840
你幫我一次 我幫你解決債務問題
You help me out, l'll be in your debt.

1101
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,310
而且如果不幫呢
And if l don't?

1102
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,310
也許你能教足球
Maybe you can coach soccer.

1103
01:30:02,060 --> 01:30:05,060
你把3發子彈打中靶心時我們再談
You put three in the centre
and maybe we'll talk.

1104
01:30:07,860 --> 01:30:09,150
能給幾發熱身嗎
Can l have a few to warm up?

1105
01:31:33,230 --> 01:31:34,950
偏右6英吋
Six inches right.

1106
01:31:35,490 --> 01:31:38,990
這是你的第二槍 沃德先生
That's your mulligan, Mr Ward.
Play ball!

1107
01:31:39,950 --> 01:31:41,290
準備 開始
Let's go.

1108
01:32:26,540 --> 01:32:28,830
你的手有點生了 雷徹先生
You're a little rusty, Mr Reacher.

1109
01:32:31,210 --> 01:32:33,840
十年前 有人用這個名子參加射擊大賽
l saw a man by that name
shoot for the Wimbledon Cup,

1110
01:32:33,960 --> 01:32:35,550
什麼 十年前
what, ten years ago.

1111
01:32:36,050 --> 01:32:39,020
我肯定你沒打過揚基隊的二壘手
And l'm pretty sure you never
played second base for the Yankees

1112
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:41,220
在 1925 年
in 1925.

1113
01:32:42,550 --> 01:32:43,720
現在
Now,

1114
01:32:44,720 --> 01:32:46,220
我將回答你的問題
l'll answer one question.

1115
01:32:47,350 --> 01:32:48,690
誰是最好的射手
Who's your best shooter?

1116
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,400
詹姆斯-巴爾
James Barr.

1117
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:57,650
聽到他打死人 就把這些摘下來了
l pulled all these down
as soon as l heard about the shooting.

1118
01:33:02,740 --> 01:33:04,660
那是人生平見過的
That's the best shot

1119
01:33:04,740 --> 01:33:06,910
最棒的槍法
l ever seen this side of civilian life.

1120
01:33:07,910 --> 01:33:12,340
我告訴你 巴爾在部隊也沒打過這麼好
Suppose l told you Barr wasn't this
good on his best day in the Army.

1121
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,510
這是我親手貼上的靶子
上面有我的筆跡
l handed out those targets myself.
That's my scrawl on every one.

1122
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,590
你也把靶子放在最遠處嗎
Do you hang them downrange, too?

1123
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:19,590
你是什麼意思
What, are you serious?

1124
01:33:20,260 --> 01:33:23,100
我是說巴爾可能有個朋友
l'm saying
it's possible that Barr had a friend.

1125
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:25,190
他換掉了射擊場裡的靶子
One who switched the targets
on the range.

1126
01:33:25,220 --> 01:33:26,560
也許是巴爾讓他換的
Maybe Barr let him.

1127
01:33:26,760 --> 01:33:29,940
當他的大名掛在牆上 感覺自己是冠軍
Made him feel like King Shit
having his name up on your wall.

1128
01:33:30,060 --> 01:33:34,440
我從沒見過一個真正的射手
會為了自己的媽媽這麼做
l never saw one real shooter
who would do that for his own mother.

1129
01:33:35,940 --> 01:33:38,940
除非他想陷害她媽媽
殺了好幾個人
Unless he was framing his mother
for multiple murder

1130
01:33:40,280 --> 01:33:42,120
而且是在你這個射擊場干的
and using your range to do it.

1131
01:33:45,450 --> 01:33:47,580
巴爾不是一個人來的 對嗎
Barr didn't come alone, did he?

1132
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:52,760
如果他們發現錄像 就會有人來殺你
You know, one of these nuts is likely
to kill you, they find that camera, there.

1133
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:54,000
錄像就在這
Hell, the camera's there

1134
01:33:54,080 --> 01:33:56,430
沒有瘋子會殺我
'cause one of these nuts
is likely to kill me.

1135
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,590
那是巴爾
There's Barr.

1136
01:34:00,630 --> 01:34:02,880
我一直很喜歡他
l always liked him. Always liked him.

1137
01:34:02,970 --> 01:34:04,060
在那裡
There.

1138
01:34:05,090 --> 01:34:06,270
他
Him.

1139
01:34:09,640 --> 01:34:11,730
混蛋
That son of a bitch.

1140
01:34:17,650 --> 01:34:19,150
海倫-羅丁
Helen Rodin speaking.

1141
01:34:19,270 --> 01:34:20,950
找到兇手備選人照片
Got a candidate for our shooter.

1142
01:34:21,150 --> 01:34:23,500
可能是他的指紋
Picture, possible prints

1143
01:34:23,990 --> 01:34:25,990
還有個證人
and one pissed-off eyewitness.

1144
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,740
我現在不能說話
l can't talk right now.

1145
01:34:28,830 --> 01:34:30,330
我3小時後回去
Just give me three hours to get back.

1146
01:34:30,490 --> 01:34:32,500
這之前不要和任何人談話
And don't talk to anyone until l get there.

1147
01:34:32,620 --> 01:34:34,460
我會處理這事 謝謝
l'll look into that, thanks.

1148
01:34:35,830 --> 01:34:38,180
這些是我今天早上拿到的資料
This is just
what l could pull this morning.

1149
01:34:38,460 --> 01:34:42,430
納稅記錄 市裡和州里的項目批准書
Tax records, city and state
permit applications, contract bids.

1150
01:34:42,510 --> 01:34:44,220
是格魯吉亞一家空殼公司
Shell corporation in Georgia.

1151
01:34:44,300 --> 01:34:46,680
挨著俄羅斯的國家 不在佛羅里達
That's the one next to Russia,
not Florida.

1152
01:34:47,470 --> 01:34:51,190
他們開發一個城市
They work one city at a time,
acquiring a local construction concern

1153
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:53,320
要求當地建築公司在開工前
just ahead of major civic redevelopment.

1154
01:34:53,520 --> 01:34:57,190
先建造沒人需要的橋樑
沒人用的高速公路
They build bridges no one needs.
Highways no one uses.

1155
01:34:57,520 --> 01:35:02,030
他們像癌細胞一樣不停地生長
They're like a cancer.
A cell that won't stop growing.

1156
01:35:03,690 --> 01:35:07,200
在15年裡搬了12次家
They moved 12 times in 15 years.
Atlanta, Albuquerque,

1157
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:10,170
亞特蘭大 阿爾布開克 奧斯汀
俄克拉荷馬
Austin, Oklahoma city, Sacramento.

1158
01:35:10,530 --> 01:35:13,380
被指記賬的名單中總是有它
Always amidst allegations of corruption

1159
01:35:13,490 --> 01:35:16,960
包括幾千萬公共資金不翼而飛
including millions of dollars
in missing public funds.

1160
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:21,390
可卻從來未被調查過 甚至從沒被質詢過
And yet never an investigation.
Never even an inquiry.

1161
01:35:21,880 --> 01:35:25,550
這個公司口碑極佳
lt's as if Lebendauer Enterprises
were above reproach.

1162
01:35:29,510 --> 01:35:32,140
也許那些是競爭對手的指責
Well, maybe that's because

1163
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,020
出高價
the allegations come
from the competition.

1164
01:35:37,390 --> 01:35:39,020
充滿敵意
Outbid. Bitter.

1165
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:41,060
比如奧賴恩-阿徹
Like Oline Archer.

1166
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:44,990
也許樂班德爾公司在跟重要部門合作
Or maybe Lebendauer
has the cooperation of key officials.

1167
01:35:45,070 --> 01:35:48,040
合作不暢時 他們就殺掉那些收買不了的
And maybe
when that cooperation isn't enough,

1168
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,660
比如奧賴恩
they kill people who won't be bought off.
Like Oline Archer.

1169
01:35:51,740 --> 01:35:53,910
這樣的傳言你相信多少
Helen, how much of this
do you honestly believe?

1170
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,210
我相信多少沒關係
lt doesn't matter how much l believe.

1171
01:35:56,910 --> 01:35:58,840
甚至連我能證實多少都無關緊要
lt doesn't even matter
how much l can prove.

1172
01:35:58,920 --> 01:36:01,420
重要的是其中有多少是真的
lt only matters how much is true.

1173
01:36:01,710 --> 01:36:03,710
你知道嗎 你這是幻聽幻覺
Do you know how delusional you sound?

1174
01:36:04,210 --> 01:36:05,890
你怎麼了
What happened to you?

1175
01:36:06,260 --> 01:36:10,430
你真想他死嗎
Are you really so set on putting
this man to death that you'd ignore...

1176
01:36:21,770 --> 01:36:24,950
所有的文件都是我自己獲得的
l pulled all of this paper
under my own name.

1177
01:36:25,940 --> 01:36:27,790
如果傑克雷-徹說得對
lf Jack Reacher's right,

1178
01:36:28,280 --> 01:36:31,620
我的命 你女兒的生命
my life, your daughter's life,

1179
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,130
現在有危險了
is in danger now.

1180
01:36:35,790 --> 01:36:37,790
我接下來出什麼事都是你造成的
Whatever happens to me next
is on your head,

1181
01:36:38,250 --> 01:36:40,210
無論是不是與你有關
whether you're involved or not.

1182
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:47,060
你是地方檢察官
我已經給了你確鑿的證據
You are the District Attorney
and l've given you compelling evidence

1183
01:36:47,130 --> 01:36:49,050
調查爾班德爾企業
to investigate Lebendauer Enterprises.

1184
01:36:49,470 --> 01:36:53,310
你的下個動作
將告訴我你的立場
Your next move
will tell me which side you're on.

1185
01:36:53,930 --> 01:36:54,980
哦

1186
01:36:56,140 --> 01:36:57,610
我知道了 這是一個測試
l see. lt's a test.

1187
01:36:58,770 --> 01:37:03,650
好吧 我很難相信你 但是我愛你
Well, this may be hard for you
to believe, but l do love you.

1188
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:08,150
我不會視而不見的
And obviously l'm not
going to turn a blind eye,

1189
01:37:08,280 --> 01:37:10,650
無論我發現這些事有多麼荒誕
no matter how absurd l find all of this.

1190
01:37:11,990 --> 01:37:15,620
如果你真的相信你有危險
So, if you really believe
that you're in danger,

1191
01:37:15,990 --> 01:37:17,490
如果你相信
if you believe that,

1192
01:37:18,830 --> 01:37:20,960
那麼接下來的任務
then the next order of business,

1193
01:37:22,000 --> 01:37:25,170
就是馬上對你進行保護監禁
is to put you
in protective custody right now.

1194
01:37:28,340 --> 01:37:30,260
如果你也是同謀呢
And how safe will l be
if you're part of it?

1195
01:37:30,670 --> 01:37:32,300
天吶 海倫
Jesus, Helen.

1196
01:38:22,730 --> 01:38:24,320
哦 嗨
Hey.

1197
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,030
公事還是私事
Business meeting or personal?

1198
01:38:35,240 --> 01:38:37,240
很難分辨
Hard to tell them apart.

1199
01:38:37,700 --> 01:38:39,080
我打賭
l'll bet.

1200
01:39:41,260 --> 01:39:42,310
-海倫
-不是
Helen?

1201
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:43,561
No.

1202
01:39:45,270 --> 01:39:46,610
對不起 打錯了
Sorry, wrong number.

1203
01:39:46,930 --> 01:39:48,560
你是雷徹嗎
ls this Reacher?

1204
01:39:50,940 --> 01:39:52,060
你是誰
Who is this?

1205
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:57,620
我是雷徹
ls this Reacher?

1206
01:40:02,450 --> 01:40:05,580
是你 車裡的人
lt's you. The guy from the car.

1207
01:40:08,080 --> 01:40:09,300
是你的男朋友
lt's your boyfriend.

1208
01:40:11,130 --> 01:40:12,470
雷徹 是你嗎
Reacher, is it you?

1209
01:40:14,090 --> 01:40:15,090
海倫 你受傷了嗎
Helen, are you hurt?

1210
01:40:15,300 --> 01:40:17,340
如果你一小時後不來 就廢了她
Well, she's gonna be
if you're not here in one hour.

1211
01:40:18,090 --> 01:40:20,140
你追得我到處跑
Do l have to tell you how this works?

1212
01:40:20,260 --> 01:40:22,060
怕我被雖人跟蹤
You'll bounce me around
to make sure l'm not followed,

1213
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:24,610
讓我走進埋伏 殺掉我
then walk me into
an ambush and kill me.

1214
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:26,980
你毀了我的驚喜
Aw, you ruined my surprise.

1215
01:40:27,270 --> 01:40:28,940
好 我會給你個更好的
Well, l can do one better.

1216
01:40:29,440 --> 01:40:31,650
我去過關鍵小溪射擊場
拿到了照片和指紋
l went down to the gun range
at Hinge Creek.

1217
01:40:32,270 --> 01:40:35,620
我要去聯幫調查局
l got the picture, prints,
and l'm going to the Feds.

1218
01:40:35,780 --> 01:40:37,450
如果你敢動那個律師
The lawyer's all yours.

1219
01:40:41,950 --> 01:40:43,000
叫翟科來
Get the Zec.

1220
01:40:52,460 --> 01:40:54,510
我想殺了你
On second thought, l'd like to kill you.

1221
01:40:54,790 --> 01:40:56,220
勝者為王
Let's say winner take all.

1222
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,340
聽著 你這個混蛋
Listen to me, you prick.

1223
01:40:57,460 --> 01:40:59,460
你要是不過來 我就殺了這個婊子
l will kill this bitch
if you're not here in one...

1224
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:02,140
該死
Shit!

1225
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:10,140
你認為我是個英雄的
You think l'm a hero?

1226
01:41:10,350 --> 01:41:14,200
我不是英雄 我只是個遊俠
l am not a hero.
l'm a drifter with nothing to lose.

1227
01:41:14,520 --> 01:41:17,370
你殺了那個女孩來陷害我
You killed that girl to put me in a frame.

1228
01:41:17,480 --> 01:41:21,490
我要扒了你的皮 喝幹你的血
l mean to beat you to death
and drink your blood from a boot.

1229
01:41:22,360 --> 01:41:26,040
聽著 這麼辦吧 你給我地址
Now, this is how it's going to work.
You're gonna give me the address

1230
01:41:26,200 --> 01:41:28,620
等我準備好了 就去找你算賬
and l'll be along
when l am damn good and ready.

1231
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:30,960
如果我打電話她不接
lf she doesn't answer the phone
when l call this number,

1232
01:41:31,040 --> 01:41:32,880
我會認為你殺了她
if l even think you've hurt her,

1233
01:41:33,210 --> 01:41:34,710
我就消失
l disappear.

1234
01:41:34,830 --> 01:41:39,640
如果你聰明點 我不是威脅你
你在明我在暗
And if you're smart, that scares you,
because l'm in your blind spot

1235
01:41:39,710 --> 01:41:41,840
而且我又沒有別的事要做
and l have nothing better to do.

1236
01:41:50,060 --> 01:41:51,100
你有筆嗎
You got a pen?

1237
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:54,570
不需要
Don't need one.

1238
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:03,470
如果每次軍方來找陸戰隊員幫忙
我都收一美元好了
lf l had a dollar for every time
the Army called the Corps for help.

1239
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:07,640
- 你有東西給我
- 是的
-You have something for me?
-Yeah.

1240
01:43:08,300 --> 01:43:09,770
在這
Here.

1241
01:43:14,270 --> 01:43:15,310
你在開玩笑, 對不對
You're kidding, right?

1242
01:43:15,430 --> 01:43:16,900
雖然我十年前看過你射擊
Just because l saw you
shoot ten years ago

1243
01:43:16,980 --> 01:43:20,450
可並不意味著我會讓你用我的槍
doesn't mean l'll let you
kill some asshole with my gun.

1244
01:43:20,650 --> 01:43:22,370
我告訴過你情況非常危急
l told you how serious this was.

1245
01:43:22,650 --> 01:43:24,320
我也被捲進去了 對嗎
And l showed up, didn't l?

1246
01:43:25,150 --> 01:43:26,320
咱們大幹一場吧
So let's get to it.

1247
01:43:28,280 --> 01:43:29,330
殺你的兇手會到這來
Now, your shooter will be

1248
01:43:29,820 --> 01:43:32,920
在那些燈光後面
right up there
behind those lights. Okay?

1249
01:43:32,990 --> 01:43:35,960
他能朝這條路射擊
He can cover both roads
coming and going.

1250
01:43:36,460 --> 01:43:39,830
你一站起來就能擊斃你
And kill you
just as soon as you stand up.

1251
01:43:39,960 --> 01:43:41,130
好吧 你能幹掉了嗎
Well, can you take him out?

1252
01:43:41,670 --> 01:43:42,920
什麼 幹掉他
What, to dinner you mean?

1253
01:43:45,010 --> 01:43:49,350
聽著 雷徹
我不知道你都和什麼人交往
Look, l don't know the type of people
you normally associate with, Reacher.

1254
01:43:49,680 --> 01:43:54,680
我沒那個習慣 毫無準備就走進荒野
But l'm not in the habit of driving out
to the boonies at the drop of a hat

1255
01:43:55,140 --> 01:43:58,490
解決掉幾個陌生人 好嗎
and just picking off 
some total strangers, all right?

1256
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:02,200
那些燈太亮 我什麼也看不清
Anyway, l can't see anything,
not with them lights up.

1257
01:44:02,310 --> 01:44:03,860
那就打滅它
So shoot them out.

1258
01:44:04,650 --> 01:44:07,400
可以
然後他就知道我在哪了
Yeah, sure.
And then he knows right where l am.

1259
01:44:07,490 --> 01:44:09,490
我這不是引火燒身嗎
l might as well set myself on fire.

1260
01:44:10,530 --> 01:44:13,410
不 先生 他開槍 我才開槍
No, sir. l'll start shooting when he does.

1261
01:44:16,040 --> 01:44:18,160
你說我們引他先開槍怎麼樣
And how do you propose
we get him started?

1262
01:44:18,710 --> 01:44:22,510
好吧  你可以開始跑了
Well, you could always start running.

1263
01:44:30,010 --> 01:44:31,560
你的眼睛怎麼了
What's wrong with your eye?

1264
01:44:31,680 --> 01:44:33,350
閉目養神
l'm saving my night vision.

1265
01:44:36,390 --> 01:44:40,570
老牛仔 問你個私人問題
Hey, Gunny, you mind if l ask you
kind of a personal question?

1266
01:44:40,690 --> 01:44:42,530
你認為我不會再射擊嗎
What, you don't think
l can shoot any more?

1267
01:44:43,230 --> 01:44:44,860
好槍法很難保持一輩子
lt is a perishable skill.

1268
01:44:45,730 --> 01:44:47,080
是啊
Yeah, well,

1269
01:44:47,650 --> 01:44:49,750
太陽一小時後就升起來了
the sun will be up in an hour.

1270
01:44:51,240 --> 01:44:52,580
我們走
Let's get going.

1271
01:45:09,590 --> 01:45:11,760
我聽到他們叫你翟科
l heard them call you the Zec.

1272
01:45:12,550 --> 01:45:13,890
那是囚犯的意思 是嗎
That means "prisoner."

1273
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:16,940
是的
Yes?

1274
01:45:19,850 --> 01:45:21,270
告訴我 殺了這麼多人
Tell me, killing all those people,

1275
01:45:22,020 --> 01:45:23,520
我相信你賺的錢
l have to believe the money
you're making

1276
01:45:23,600 --> 01:45:25,030
不可能足夠用來
can't possibly be enough to just...

1277
01:45:25,110 --> 01:45:26,360
說夠了嗎
Enough?

1278
01:45:26,610 --> 01:45:28,450
根本沒有這回事
There is no such thing.

1279
01:45:28,780 --> 01:45:30,780
我們只拿屬於我們的東西
We take what can be taken.

1280
01:45:31,110 --> 01:45:32,660
我們就是這麼做的
This is what we do.

1281
01:45:35,120 --> 01:45:36,460
而你呢
And you?

1282
01:45:38,120 --> 01:45:40,710
他我能理解 可是你呢
This one l think l understand, but you?

1283
01:45:41,370 --> 01:45:42,460
你是為什麼
Why'd you do it?

1284
01:45:42,790 --> 01:45:45,130
我沒得選擇
You make it sound like l had a choice.

1285
01:45:45,290 --> 01:45:46,460
你沒有嗎
Oh, didn't you?

1286
01:45:49,960 --> 01:45:51,310
你會懂的
You'll see.

1287
01:45:55,140 --> 01:45:58,480
你們應該知道 我們已經採取了措施
You should know l've taken steps,
that if anything happens...

1288
01:45:58,560 --> 01:46:02,280
如果你發生意外
也會在你父親面前
lf anything happens to you,
it will happen in front of your father

1289
01:46:02,390 --> 01:46:04,440
他祈求留你一條小命
while he begs for your life.

1290
01:46:06,650 --> 01:46:08,990
現在你必須說服他忘掉這一切
You should never have involved him.

1291
01:46:09,320 --> 01:46:13,040
為了你
Now you will have to convince him
to forget,for your sake

1292
01:46:13,110 --> 01:46:15,370
也為了他
and for his.

1293
01:46:16,240 --> 01:46:19,920
你不說話 我能看到你眼中充滿了蔑視
You say nothing,
but l see defiance in your eyes.

1294
01:46:20,660 --> 01:46:23,510
這種眼神我見多了
That is a look l have seen
many, many times.

1295
01:46:23,830 --> 01:46:26,180
等那個大兵來了之後
When the soldier comes,

1296
01:46:26,250 --> 01:46:28,670
你親眼看著他死去
那會改變你的想法
when you watch how he dies,
it will change you.

1297
01:46:29,170 --> 01:46:31,390
到時你就會想忘記我了
You will want to forget me then.

1298
01:46:42,180 --> 01:46:43,430
雷徹
Reacher?

1299
01:46:43,520 --> 01:46:44,860
你好嗎
Are you okay?

1300
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,320
他們要殺你
They're ready for you.

1301
01:46:47,270 --> 01:46:48,900
他們這麼認為
They'd like to think so.

1302
01:46:49,860 --> 01:46:52,360
別來 不要為了我
Don't do this.
Please don't do this. Not for me.

1303
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:54,070
海倫, 他們不會傷害你的
Listen, Helen, they're not gonna

1304
01:46:54,190 --> 01:46:58,170
在沒有抓到我之前
hurt you until they have me.
And that's never going to happen.

1305
01:46:58,370 --> 01:46:59,540
你聽我說
You hear me?

1306
01:47:00,620 --> 01:47:01,710
你要堅持住
You just hang in there.

1307
01:47:03,540 --> 01:47:05,380
我會去救你
'Cause l'm coming to get you.

1308
01:47:07,120 --> 01:47:08,470
快說你相信我
Now say you believe me.

1309
01:47:09,960 --> 01:47:11,340
我相信你
l believe you.

1310
01:47:43,160 --> 01:47:45,040
這是個餿主意
This was a bad idea.

1311
01:48:03,930 --> 01:48:05,560
老年仔 準備射擊
Any time now, Gunny.

1312
01:48:20,610 --> 01:48:22,210
該死
Shit.

1313
01:48:33,880 --> 01:48:35,420
你在哪裡 老牛仔
Where the hell are you, Gunny?

1314
01:52:53,720 --> 01:52:55,390
臭手
Suck it!

1315
01:53:06,570 --> 01:53:08,070
你該走了
You should go.

1316
01:53:51,283 --> 01:53:52,617
Toss it.

1317
01:56:51,040 --> 01:56:53,140
我知道你是在那裡 愛默生
l know you're in there, Emerson.

1318
01:56:56,960 --> 01:56:59,640
我有你的犯罪證據
lt was staring me right in the face.

1319
01:57:01,300 --> 01:57:04,810
一個證據不能解釋一切
The one piece that just didn't fit.

1320
01:57:05,640 --> 01:57:07,110
硬幣
The quarter.

1321
01:57:09,480 --> 01:57:12,450
沒人想到計時表的硬幣就是證據
Nobody would have thought
to dump that meter.

1322
01:57:14,150 --> 01:57:15,650
連我都不會這麼想
Not even me.

1323
01:57:59,150 --> 01:58:01,150
你錯怪了我的父親

1328
01:58:30,020 --> 01:58:31,690
他們叫他翟科
They call him the Zec.

1329
01:58:31,980 --> 01:58:34,190
翟科 就是囚犯

1330

打電話給警察
Call the police.

1340
01:59:11,560 --> 01:59:13,350
你剛才真想殺了他嗎
Were you really going to shoot him?

1341
01:59:15,060 --> 01:59:16,900
不會的

我們不著急

1347
01:59:37,040 --> 01:59:39,260
你住監獄 就像在家裡一樣舒服
With a name like yours,
you're gonna feel right at home.

1348
01:59:39,580 --> 01:59:42,260
監獄 在美國

1349
01:59:42,750 --> 01:59:46,930

What's it look like?

1361
02:00:27,420 --> 02:00:28,470

怎麼才能抓到真到的兇手

1365
02:00:43,820 --> 02:00:46,940
怎樣洗清巴爾的罪名

你問我是不是害怕象巴爾那樣的結果
You asked if l was afraid
l'd end up like Barr. l'm not.

1376
02:01:17,350 --> 02:01:19,190
我不怕 我恐怕最終會像這傢伙一樣
l'm afraid l'll end up like this guy.

1377

Now, the police didn't

沒有我在場 他們不能和你談話
They're not allowed
to do that without me here.

1391
02:02:14,570 --> 02:02:16,250

讓太陽照在我背上
The sun would be at my back
that time of day.
