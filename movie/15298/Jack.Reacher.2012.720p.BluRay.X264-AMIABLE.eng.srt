And a Purple Heart.
He spent the bulk of his service

51
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:47,231

By all accounts, a brilliant investigator.

153
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,179
No. Not my father.
The Office of the District Attorney.

154
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:24,977
Because the Office of the District
Attorney never bought you a pony.

155
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:28,720
D.A. Rodin's never lost a capital case.
You know why?

156
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:30,354
Impeccable tailoring.

157
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,315
- He never picks a fight he can't win.
- Worked for the Red Baron.

158
00:15:33,391 --> 00:15:35,064
Every murder suspect in this town
is given a choice.

159
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,811
Confess or face death.

160
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,231
Against a D.A. who never loses.

161
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,482
My firm has reason to believe
more than one innocent man

162
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:43,068
has gone down without a fight.

163
00:15:43,651 --> 00:15:45,153
Oh, I get it.

164
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:47,329
You're an idealist.

165
00:15:47,822 --> 00:15:49,665
No. I'm a pacifist.

166
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,250
It's a noble crusade.

167
00:15:51,492 --> 00:15:55,247
But this is not the fight. Trust me.
James Barr's guilty.

168
00:15:55,413 --> 00:15:57,211
You haven't even seen the evidence.

169
00:16:01,544 --> 00:16:03,262
Is this a privileged conversation?

170
00:16:03,379 --> 00:16:07,100
Of course, it's a client conference.
Nothing you say here can be repeated.

171
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,854
There are four types of people
who join the military.

172
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,727
For some, it's a family trade.

173
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,567
Others are patriots, eager to serve.

174
00:16:16,893 --> 00:16:18,895
Next, you have those
who just need a job.

175
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:23,404
Then there's the kind who want a legal
means of killing other people.

176
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:25,743
James Barr was one of those.

177
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:28,071
<i>He made sniper.</i>

178
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:31,408
<i>Trained hard.
Two thousand rounds a week.</i>

179
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,834
<i>And with every shot,
he's taught to visualise</i>

180
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:36,538
<i>the base of a man's skull
through his reticle.</i>

181
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,590
<i>The sweet spot where
the medulla meets the spine.</i>

182
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,253
<i>Visualise that puff of pink mist.</i>

183
00:16:43,628 --> 00:16:44,720
<font color="#D900D9">(CLICKS)</font>

184
00:16:45,087 --> 00:16:46,930
<i>Finally, he's deployed to Iraq.</i>

185
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,929
<i>He's put on overwatch.</i>

186
00:16:49,550 --> 00:16:52,429
<i>All day long
he stares through a scope at civilians.</i>

187
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,267
<i>Women.</i>

188
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:55,644
<i>Children.</i>

189
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,772
Day in, day out, for two long years

190
00:16:58,893 --> 00:17:01,897
without ever once being
cleared to fire a single shot.

191
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:04,782
Then comes the drawdown.

192
00:17:05,775 --> 00:17:07,402
For James Barr, the war's over.

193
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:10,287
<i>Two thousand rounds a week.</i>

194
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,243
<i>A quarter million rounds in his career,
not one at a human target.</i>

195
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:17,620
<i>You've been hungry.
You've been horny.</i>

196
00:17:17,954 --> 00:17:20,298
<i>You've had an itch you can't scratch.</i>

197
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,795
<i>Imagine that feeling.
Days. Weeks. Years.</i>

198
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:29,132
<i>Imagine that feeling times 200,000,
plus 50,000 more.</i>

199
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:33,345
<i>Imagine it's 130 degrees on the deck
and tomorrow you're going home</i>

200
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,437
<i>and you know if you don't
scratch that itch now,</i>

201
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:37,140
<i>you never will.</i>

202
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,146
<i>You need a release.</i>

203
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:41,311
<i>You need a target.</i>

204
00:17:41,644 --> 00:17:44,614
<i>And the who of it
never once enters your mind.</i>

<font color="#D900D9">(FIRING)</font>

206
00:18:01,831 --> 00:18:03,833
<i>He covered his tracks well,</i>

207
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,631
just like sane people do.

208
00:18:06,210 --> 00:18:10,886
He almost got away with it, too.
But I caught him. And he confessed.

209
00:18:11,132 --> 00:18:12,725
So why didn't he go to prison?

210
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:17,180
What Barr didn't know that day was the
four civilian contractors he'd picked off

211
00:18:17,305 --> 00:18:20,559
<i>just spent the weekend
at what they call a rape-rally.</i>

212
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:24,737
It was 28 women,
ages 54 on down to 11.

213
00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,820
Those were just the ones I could find
before the case was shut down.

214
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,990
See, the deeper I dug, the uglier it got.

215
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:35,665
And after seven long years
of "Mission Accomplished,"

216
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:39,335
someone in the corporation just wanted
the whole thing to end quietly.

217
00:18:39,827 --> 00:18:43,331
So they chalked it up to the fog of war,
made the murders go away.

218
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:45,758
This is classified information.

219
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:48,841
And that's why the privilege.

220
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:51,172
But you were ready
to tell this to the D.A.

221
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:55,226
The last time I saw Barr,
I made him a promise.

222
00:18:56,010 --> 00:18:59,184
And when I saw his name on the news,
I came here to keep it.

223
00:19:00,348 --> 00:19:03,067
- But now I know I don't have to.
- How can you be sure?

224
00:19:03,684 --> 00:19:05,686
You still haven't seen the evidence.

225
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:09,741
Your father has.
And he doesn't pick a fight he can't win.

226
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,406
Barr's not getting away
with murder again.

227
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,369
He might.

228
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:18,241
He suffered a severe brain injury
in state custody.

229
00:19:18,407 --> 00:19:20,125
When he wakes up, if he wakes up,

230
00:19:20,242 --> 00:19:22,961
he may not remember the event,
he may not remember anything at all.

231
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,758
And this case won't be about
James Barr's guilt or innocence.

232
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:31,088
It'll be about his ability to stand trial.

233
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:36,392
After everything I just told you,
you still want to defend him?

234
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:38,561
I want to see he gets a fair trial.

235
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:43,273
You said he confessed in Baghdad.

236
00:19:43,808 --> 00:19:45,435
He didn't confess this time.

237
00:19:45,643 --> 00:19:47,924
- This time he knows better.
- This time he asked for you.

238
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,198
I want to know why.

239
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:54,322
You want to know why.
I can see it's eating you.

240
00:19:54,443 --> 00:19:55,990
And you can't ask Barr,

241
00:19:56,112 --> 00:19:58,456
and the D.A. won't let you
see the evidence.

242
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:04,455
My lead investigator has complete
access to the evidence. All of it.

243
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:09,504
- So where's your lead investigator?
- About to catch a bus out of town.

at a cold-blooded killer.

A man you want to keep off death row.

to look at him objectively.

00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,278
Hello, Dad.

305
00:26:49,358 --> 00:26:50,701
What the hell are you doing?

306
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,369
What am I... What?

307
00:26:52,528 --> 00:26:53,529
Is it true?

308
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,735
You're talking to the victims' families?
You? Alone?

309
00:26:56,824 --> 00:26:58,747
How do you know that?
How did you find me here?

310
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,120
I'm the District Attorney.
It's my business to know.

311
00:27:01,203 --> 00:27:02,250
That's not an answer.

312
00:27:02,371 --> 00:27:06,547
Oh. Well, you're not the only one
with crack investigators, Helen.

313
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:09,378
That's right. I know about Reacher.

314
00:27:09,711 --> 00:27:12,055
Your lead investigator is a war veteran

315
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,721
who's been missing
for the last two years.

316
00:27:15,509 --> 00:27:17,637
How can you vouch
for his state of mind?

317
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,062
How can you trust anything he tells you?

318
00:27:19,179 --> 00:27:20,396
You don't know the man.

319
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:24,727
Tell me this,
does he know you can't pay him?

320
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:27,233
That your own firm
didn't want this case?

321
00:27:27,354 --> 00:27:29,573
That nobody wants this case?

322
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,536
You never even spoke to your client
before he wound up in a coma.

323
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,335
Oh, now listen to me! Listen.
Listen, I'm speaking as your father.

324
00:27:36,572 --> 00:27:38,449
Whatever our differences
have been in the past,

325
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:40,247
you gotta listen to me now.

326
00:27:42,244 --> 00:27:44,588
You're making a terrible mistake.

327
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,424
You cannot win this case.

328
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,421
You're going to ruin your career.
Why? For what?

329
00:27:52,421 --> 00:27:55,425
To hurt me? To change me?

330
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:57,264
- Helen...
- Don't touch me!

331

<font color="#808080">REACHER:</font>
Thanks for letting me take a look.

332

Hey. We love it
when friends of the accused

333
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:15,069
try to tear our work to shreds.

334
00:28:15,277 --> 00:28:16,620
He's not my friend.

335
00:28:16,778 --> 00:28:19,782
So you keep saying. Find any holes?

336
00:28:20,115 --> 00:28:22,288
Well, you didn't have to
put him in the hospital.

337
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:26,463
Other than that, damn fine police work.
It's open and shut.

338
00:28:27,956 --> 00:28:30,175
What can I say?
The scene was a gold mine.

339
00:28:30,292 --> 00:28:33,796
Come on. Now we both know
gold's only as good as the man digging.

340
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:36,800
Yeah, well, anytime you want to come
back, take a look at this stuff...

341
00:28:36,924 --> 00:28:38,642
No, thanks. Don't need to.

342
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,469
You never took any notes.

343
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,142
Oh, I don't need to.

So you were some real hot shit
in the Army, huh?

346
00:28:48,936 --> 00:28:50,279
I did all right.

347
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:53,320
So what does an Army cop do mostly?
Break up bar fights?

348
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:56,819
I did what you do pretty much,
with one minor difference.

349
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:57,986
What's that?

350
00:28:58,487 --> 00:29:00,831
Every suspect was a trained killer.

351
00:29:01,782 --> 00:29:03,125
Thanks again.

352
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:11,174
Why do you think he paid for parking?

353
00:29:13,669 --> 00:29:14,795
Pardon?

354
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:18,683
He's about to fire six shots
into a crowd of strangers.

355
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:21,176
And he's worried about the meter maid?

356
00:29:21,343 --> 00:29:23,016
"Simple loony" won't do it for you?

357
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:25,351
I like to have
at least one alternate theory.

358
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:27,687
Huh.

359
00:29:28,517 --> 00:29:29,689
Habit.

360
00:29:30,352 --> 00:29:31,695
Muscle memory.

361
00:29:32,354 --> 00:29:34,356
I don't think he knew he was doing it.

362
00:29:36,358 --> 00:29:38,702
Like I said, it's damn fine work.

363
00:29:38,986 --> 00:29:40,033
Hey, Army.

364
00:29:41,697 --> 00:29:43,699
What's the serial number on the rifle?

365
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:49,276
What's the date on the quarter?

366
00:29:52,374 --> 00:29:53,546
1968.

367
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,718
Forest for the trees, Detective.

368

What's your name?

376

Jimmie Reese.

377

You don't look like a Jimmie.

I don't know. But not a Jimmie.

Hmm.

381
00:31:47,072 --> 00:31:48,915
So you're new in town?

It's kind of loud in here.

Do you want to maybe go
someplace quieter? I have a car.

You're old enough to drive?

I'm old enough to do a lot of things.

is a reflection on my firm. On me.

462
00:37:03,805 --> 00:37:04,806
I was set up.

463
00:37:04,973 --> 00:37:06,065
You're talking to a lawyer.

464
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:09,065
There was this girl. She came onto me.
Picked a fight.

465
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,737
Which never happens in a bar.

466
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,897
She was thrown
when I told her my name.

467
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,224
She was expecting Mike Tyson?

468
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:15,988
She wasn't expecting Jimmie Reese.

469
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:19,741
Yankees second baseman.

470
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,281
Why did you say you were
a Yankees second baseman?

471
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:25,164
I always use Yankees second basemen.

472
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,497
I didn't say I was a Yankees
second baseman, I just said...

473
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:32,171
Look, the point is,

474
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:34,173
she was expecting to hear
"Jack Reacher."

475
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,427
She knew who I was.

476
00:37:35,503 --> 00:37:37,505
And the cops were rolling
before the fight even started.

477
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:40,516
And those five guys are her brothers?
Come on.

478
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:44,183
Someone sent those boys
to put me down.

479
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:47,519
Who?

480
00:37:50,518 --> 00:37:52,646
<font color="#808080">HELEN:</font> If someone followed you
at the river today,

481
00:37:52,729 --> 00:37:54,527
it was probably a cop.
And I highly doubt...

482
00:37:54,606 --> 00:37:56,108
There are three things cops never do.

483
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,860
They don't vote Democrat,
they don't drive Cadillacs,

484
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,116
and they never use personal vehicles.

485
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,622
It's not a cop.

486
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,876
A P.I., then, or the D.A.'s office.

487
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,791
You think your father's office
would set me up?

488
00:38:07,869 --> 00:38:09,121
Why would anyone set you up?

489
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,456
How was your day?

490
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,040
It went exactly the way I think

491
00:38:13,041 --> 00:38:14,793
you hoped it would.

492
00:38:16,878 --> 00:38:17,925
You Okay?

493
00:38:19,047 --> 00:38:20,094
Mmm-hmm.

494
00:38:21,633 --> 00:38:22,805
What'd you learn?

495
00:38:25,804 --> 00:38:28,307
<font color="#808080">HELEN:</font> <i>Chrissie Farrior was 22.</i>

496
00:38:29,474 --> 00:38:33,320
<i>A nanny caring for the six-year-old
daughter of family friends.</i>

497
00:38:34,813 --> 00:38:37,407
She'd finally saved enough
money for a trip to China,

498
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:39,610
in fact, she should have left
the week before.

499
00:38:39,984 --> 00:38:44,160
<i>But the girl she cared for wanted
Chrissie to stay for her 7th birthday.</i>

500
00:38:45,323 --> 00:38:48,668
<i>They'd gone downtown that day
to shop for a party dress.</i>

501
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:56,339
<i>Rita Coronado worked as a cleaning
lady at the River Cross Plaza.</i>

502
00:38:57,085 --> 00:38:59,929
She was usually late for work,
but she had a good reason.

503
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:02,470
<i>Since her son Marco
was nine years old</i>

504
00:39:02,590 --> 00:39:06,561
<i>she had to personally drop him at
school to make sure he actually went.</i>

505
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,809
<i>But her dedication had paid off.</i>

506
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:11,691
<i>Marco was now an honour student.</i>

507
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,977
<i>As a reward for all his hard work,</i>

508
00:39:14,102 --> 00:39:16,275
<i>Rita was taking him
to his first baseball game.</i>

509
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,321
<i>And she was on her way to pick up
the tickets that very afternoon.</i>

510
00:39:22,694 --> 00:39:25,368
<i>Nancy Holt's last words to her husband
were</i> a <i>lie.</i>

511
00:39:25,697 --> 00:39:27,290
- I love you, babe. See you!
- Bye.

512
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:29,208
She told him she was
taking her car to be serviced,

513
00:39:29,284 --> 00:39:31,537
but in fact, she was headed downtown.

514
00:39:34,706 --> 00:39:35,753
It's perfect.

515
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,912
<i>She told the clerk she didn't want the
purchase showing up on her credit card.</i>

516
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,134
<i>She wanted to surprise her
husband for their 10th anniversary</i>

517
00:39:43,631 --> 00:39:45,633
<i>- just a few days away.</i>
- Thank you.

518
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:51,223
<i>Oline Archer never liked
her husband's construction business,</i>

519
00:39:51,556 --> 00:39:56,062
<i>even after helping him become one of
the largest contractors in the county.</i>

520
00:39:56,561 --> 00:40:00,611
<i>So it came as a relief when
his failing health and a costly lawsuit</i>

521
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:02,488
<i>were forcing them
to sell to the competition.</i>

522
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:03,826
Rob?

523
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:05,696
Help! Help!

524
00:40:08,323 --> 00:40:11,327
<i>Her husband
had given his life for the company.</i>

525
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:14,245
<i>But now that it was hers,</i>

526
00:40:14,746 --> 00:40:16,840
<i>she couldn't bring herself to let it go.</i>

527
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,094
<i>She was on her way
to secure a loan that day</i>

528
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:28,435
<i>so she could keep the business
she'd always hated.</i>

529
00:40:29,427 --> 00:40:31,600
<i>Darren Sawyer was
an investment broker</i>

530

<i>in the same building where Rita worked.</i>

531
00:40:34,015 --> 00:40:37,110
<i>His wife said
he'd grown increasingly distant of late.</i>

532
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:42,028
<i>She can't remember their last words
to one another, but they weren't kind.</i>

533
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,693
<i>Darren's body was found beside
a fresh bouquet of roses</i>

535

536
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:52,954
<i>he was most likely thinking of her.</i>

537
00:41:12,804 --> 00:41:15,023
We're gonna be okay.
We're gonna be okay.

538
00:41:15,098 --> 00:41:16,475
We're gonna be okay.

539
00:41:16,808 --> 00:41:18,560
We're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay,

540
00:41:18,643 --> 00:41:20,244
we're gonna be okay,
we're gonna be okay.

<font color="#808080">REACHER:</font> So what'd you learn?

542
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,162
You want me to say you were right.

543
00:41:37,245 --> 00:41:39,122
You want me to say
that this isn't the fight.

544
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:41,837
James Barr should die.

545
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,465
Maybe he should.

546
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:46,470
I meant, what did you
learn about the victims.

547
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,551
What more do you want?

548
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,849
They were five innocent people
senselessly murdered.

549
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:51,926
I'm sorry.
Could you please put a shirt on?

550
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,515
This is my shirt.

551
00:41:55,013 --> 00:41:56,105
You lose your luggage?

552
00:41:56,264 --> 00:41:57,766
I don't have any luggage.

553
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,685
Uh, what was I saying?

554
00:42:00,852 --> 00:42:03,355
- Five innocent people.
- Murdered at random, yes.

555
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,278
<font color="#D900D9">(EXHALES DEEPLY)</font>

556
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:09,110
You know how many people
die in this country every year?

557
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,782
Two and a half million.

558
00:42:12,113 --> 00:42:13,205
That means every day,

559
00:42:13,364 --> 00:42:17,119
roughly 7,000 average Americans
wake up for the last time.

560
00:42:17,452 --> 00:42:20,501
Last Friday, five of them converged
on a single spot and died together.

561
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:21,622
Is that random?

562
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:23,128
What else would you call it?

563
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:26,427
Well, take Darren and Nancy.
Odds are they were having an affair.

564
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,549
Excuse me?

565
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,347
You don't buy roses
for your wife on the way to work.

566
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,138
<i>You buy them on the way home.</i>

567
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:35,811
And you don't worry about a charge
showing up on your credit card

568
00:42:35,887 --> 00:42:37,639
when your anniversary is that weekend.

569
00:42:38,056 --> 00:42:39,979
<i>Unless it's the gift you're hiding.</i>

570
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:45,021
And that's why she kept walking

571
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:49,400
while everyone else ran.

572
00:42:49,650 --> 00:42:50,993
You can't prove that.

573
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:54,580
How hard would it be?
Cell phones, e-mails.

574
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,668
All it takes is someone willing to dig.

575
00:42:58,826 --> 00:43:00,828
What's your point exactly?

576
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:04,416
My point is that two of the victims
weren't there strictly by chance.

577
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,260
I need a list of Barr's known associates.

578
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:10,513
There isn't one. He didn't have any.

579
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,761
He's a classic loner.
He didn't even talk to his neighbours.

580
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,263
He was a quiet man.
Never bothered anyone.

581
00:43:15,343 --> 00:43:16,686
Yeah, exactly.

582
00:43:16,761 --> 00:43:19,935
- You have his credit card statement?
- I can get it. Why?

583
00:43:20,014 --> 00:43:22,312
I need the list
of all the places he hung out.

584
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,860
Bars, bowling alleys, strip clubs,

585
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:26,775
gun ranges.

586
00:43:27,105 --> 00:43:28,652
Anywhere someone
would remember him.

587
00:43:28,731 --> 00:43:29,903
What do we hope to find?

588
00:43:30,942 --> 00:43:32,194
I need some sleep.

589
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,787
You, too.

590
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:36,930
You don't really think I'm gonna...

591
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,623
Be back to pick me up at 7:00.

592
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,387
Yep. Absolutely.

593
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:32,845
Who's with you?

594
00:44:33,087 --> 00:44:34,509
What happened?

595
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:37,346
Oh, that's him, isn't it?

596
00:44:38,176 --> 00:44:39,519
I ain't seeing you, man!

597
00:44:39,760 --> 00:44:41,433
Relax. What happened?

598
00:44:43,014 --> 00:44:45,312
Barr's attorney hired an investigator.

599
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:48,527
Name of Reacher.
Some sort of top-shelf Army cop.

600
00:44:48,603 --> 00:44:50,697
He was in Baghdad
the same time as Barr.

601
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:52,527
So?

602
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:56,369
So Barr asked for this soldier by name.

603
00:44:56,444 --> 00:44:59,323
Then he shows up at the river today.
Then up on the highway.

604
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:01,203
Almost like he knew something.

605
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:04,706
And you said we don't like
people asking questions.

606
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:06,207
No, we sure don't.

607
00:45:06,454 --> 00:45:07,797
So I took steps.

608
00:45:09,207 --> 00:45:10,880
You took steps.

609
00:45:11,209 --> 00:45:13,382
Local people. My guys.

610
00:45:13,711 --> 00:45:15,304
And it blew back on you.

611
00:45:16,214 --> 00:45:17,932
I figured five guys would do it.

612
00:45:18,007 --> 00:45:21,056
Mmm. This franchise
was yours to manage.

613
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,229
That's all. Maintenance is our thing,
you understand?

614
00:45:24,305 --> 00:45:25,352
Yeah, I understand. I couldn't reach you!

615
00:45:25,473 --> 00:45:26,474
Well, that's how this works.

616
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,900
Well, I had to make a decision!

617
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:30,691
- These locals, I want their names.
- It's in the file.

618
00:45:30,895 --> 00:45:32,055
Any of them know who you are?

619
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:34,156
Just one, but I took care of it.

620
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:36,658
You...

621
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:39,529
<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font> - Where's the body?
- It's distributed.

<font color="#D900D9">(SCOFFS)</font>

623
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:41,785
Relax! No one's gonna find it.

624
00:45:41,864 --> 00:45:44,162
- Suppose we want it found, yeah?
- Why the hell would you want it found?

625
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,246
'Cause we got a way of doing things
so they stay done.

626
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:49,088
Clean!

627
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,211
A missing person isn't clean.

628
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,815
Christ's sakes, man. You only had to kill
one goddamn person.

629
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:55,314
You tapped five! You call that clean?

630
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:59,512
I call it done. They're looking
at the shooter, not the target.

631
00:45:59,674 --> 00:46:00,766
Jesus.

632
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,847
We make it messy now
so it won't get messy later.

633
00:46:04,929 --> 00:46:08,103
And we don't leave
questions unanswered ever.

634
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,276
Okay, all right. Okay. I can fix this.

I mean, you can still use me,
just tell me how to fix...

640
00:46:29,954 --> 00:46:33,800
To survive.
Don't say "fix it," because you can't.

641
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:37,129
We covered up the one mess.
You made another.

642
00:46:37,295 --> 00:46:38,968
All right. You're right.

643
00:46:39,046 --> 00:46:40,548
You're right.
You're absolutely right. I'm sorry.

644
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:43,305
Just tell me what I have to do.

645
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,055
I was in prison in Siberia.

646
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:51,146
I spent my first winter
wearing a dead man's coat.

647
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,648
A hole in one pocket.

648
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:55,988
I chewed these fingers off

649
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:59,158
before the frostbite
could turn to gangrene.

650
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:05,165
These I gave up
to avoid working in the sulphur mine.

651
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,994
That is how I survived
when so many others did not.

652
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:14,669
A man this rare can always be of use.

653
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:19,174
So show me. Show me you are rare.

654
00:47:20,004 --> 00:47:22,427
Show me you'll do anything to survive.

655
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:25,476
I don't understand.

656
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:28,517

- I don't understand.

What we always do.

672
00:49:08,279 --> 00:49:10,828
Barr's credit card statement.
Eyewitness testimonies.

673
00:49:11,449 --> 00:49:14,293
Coffee. You take it black, right?

674
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:22,635
Yeah. What can I say?
I take my work home.

675
00:49:36,432 --> 00:49:39,106
Afraid Barr's credit card
statement's a dead end.

676
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:44,065
No bars, no strip joints, nothing.
Pretty much just gas and groceries.

677
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:49,620
I need you to look for gun ranges
between 100 and 150 miles from here.

678
00:49:50,154 --> 00:49:52,657
Limit your search to ranges
longer than 300 yards.

679
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,078
Sure, if you tell me why.

680
00:49:54,158 --> 00:49:56,661
Barr consistently filled
his tank on Saturday,

681
00:49:56,785 --> 00:49:58,002
and again on Sunday.

682
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,760
He took a long drive
almost every weekend.

683
00:49:59,997 --> 00:50:02,091
- He could be going anywhere.
- Yes.

684
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,174
And if it's bars, bowling alleys
or strip clubs, we'll never find it.

685
00:50:06,504 --> 00:50:09,633
But a Match-level gun range?
There might be two.

686
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:13,511
And he made his own bullets.
That means he shot a lot.

687
00:50:14,345 --> 00:50:16,018
I'm guessing every Saturday.

688
00:50:17,181 --> 00:50:18,603
Maybe with a friend.

689
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:21,435
Why is it so important
you talk to his friends?

690
00:50:21,519 --> 00:50:22,645
Assuming he had any.

691
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,355
Drop me at the auto parts store.

692

I... Wait. Which one?

693
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:28,859
I don't know.
She just said "the auto parts store."

694
00:50:28,943 --> 00:50:29,990
She? Who?

695
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:31,612
Reacher, can you be
a little more specific?

696
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,039
I didn't say "an auto parts store."

as the auto parts store?

724
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:02,726
I didn't know that was going to happen!

725
00:53:08,519 --> 00:53:09,566
It was Jeb.

The big guy.

727
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,363
Jeb Oliver.

728
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:21,665
He told me you were a predator.
You were supposed to star groping me.

729
00:53:28,205 --> 00:53:29,673
Just don't hurt me.

730

Where can I find Jeb?

I don't know.
He didn't come to work today.

733
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,887
So he works here.

734
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:41,556
Yeah.

735
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,560
It's bullshit, though. He cooks crystal.

790
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:29,130
The last I saw him,
we was all leaving jail.

791
01:00:29,209 --> 01:00:30,756
He said he had to see a guy.

01:00:30,919 --> 01:00:32,592
- What guy? Who?
- I don't know.

I don't know, I swear.

794
01:00:34,339 --> 01:00:36,683
Next I know,
his mom woke up from a bender

795
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:37,975
and his shit's all gone.

796
01:00:38,343 --> 01:00:40,437
Is he the sort to light out like that?

797
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:43,098
No, no, man.
He'd never leave his moms alone.

798
01:00:43,181 --> 01:00:44,433
Shit ain't right.

799
01:00:44,516 --> 01:00:46,268

- It's outside.

Now look at my face.

Do you ever want to see me again?

No way.

807
01:01:08,373 --> 01:01:10,046

820
01:02:04,721 --> 01:02:06,519
What is that on your head?

821
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:08,854
Uh...

822
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:14,565
You don't want to know.

823
01:02:16,983 --> 01:02:19,532
You said on the phone
you wanted to submit your findings.

824
01:02:22,113 --> 01:02:25,458
James Barr was a sniper.
Not the best, not the worst.

825
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,452
But he trained non-stop for two years.

826
01:02:27,535 --> 01:02:28,815
What does training like that do?

827
01:02:28,954 --> 01:02:30,831
What does any training do?

828
01:02:30,914 --> 01:02:33,793
Skills become reflex. Muscle memory.
You do without thinking.

829
01:02:33,875 --> 01:02:37,470
It also makes people who aren't
necessarily smart seem smart

830
01:02:37,712 --> 01:02:39,965
by beating some
tactical awareness into them.

831
01:02:40,215 --> 01:02:42,468
Now, 99% of the evidence
your father has against Barr

832
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:44,143
didn't exist in Baghdad,

833
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:47,189
not because Barr was smart,
but because he was trained.

834
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:51,397
<i>See, from that garage,
the shooter had the sun in his eyes.</i>

835
01:02:51,559 --> 01:02:54,654
<i>Targets were moving left and right.
It's difficult conditions for any sniper.</i>

836
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,403
But Baghdad, you said Barr
was in a parking garage then.

837
01:02:57,482 --> 01:03:00,201
Because in Baghdad,
the sun's behind him.

838
01:03:00,402 --> 01:03:03,155
<i>Targets coming straight ahead,
single file.</i>

839
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,033
Ideal conditions
for even an average shooter

840
01:03:07,075 --> 01:03:08,827
and the exact same conditions

841
01:03:08,994 --> 01:03:11,372
<i>he would've had
up on that highway bridge.</i>

842
01:03:12,247 --> 01:03:15,467
<i>Up there, he would never even
have to get out of the van.</i>

843
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:18,470
<i>No parking meter.</i>

844
01:03:18,670 --> 01:03:19,717
<i>No camera.</i>

845
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:24,221
<i>No trace evidence left behind.
And his escape is assured.</i>

846
01:03:24,342 --> 01:03:26,015
Now, I'm not saying
that he couldn't have killed

847
01:03:26,094 --> 01:03:28,517
those people at the river,
but he wouldn't have.

848
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,643
Not that way.

849
01:03:29,723 --> 01:03:31,191
- So you're saying he's crazy.
- No.

850
01:03:31,266 --> 01:03:33,268
Well, what exactly are you saying?

851
01:03:33,351 --> 01:03:37,026
Any single piece of evidence I'd buy.
But all of it?

852
01:03:37,105 --> 01:03:39,733
Fibres, fingerprints, stray brass,
I mean...

853
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:41,818
And who the hell pays for parking?

854
01:03:42,027 --> 01:03:44,701
Sane or crazy,
that just doesn't make sense.

855
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:49,455
Okay. So Barr, he wanted to get caught
and he wanted you to catch him.

856
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,379
That would not explain how Barr,

857
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:57,626
an average shooter firing
in poor conditions, never missed.

858
01:03:57,792 --> 01:03:58,964
He did miss.

859
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:00,594
He did.

860
01:04:03,715 --> 01:04:04,932
A pristine bullet,

861
01:04:05,884 --> 01:04:08,353
<i>conveniently trapped
by a liquid backstop.</i>

862
01:04:10,347 --> 01:04:12,896
The same bullet that tied
Barr's gun to the killings.

863
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:16,861
And arguably the prosecution's single
most important piece of evidence.

864
01:04:17,354 --> 01:04:20,574
If Barr wanted to get caught,
he didn't miss.

865
01:04:21,191 --> 01:04:22,552
Either way, it doesn't make sense.

866
01:04:22,734 --> 01:04:25,078
If he wanted to get away with it,
he likely would have

867
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:26,868
and if he wanted to get caught,

868
01:04:27,197 --> 01:04:29,791
Barr was incapable of such perfection.

869
01:04:29,908 --> 01:04:31,828
Or maybe he just got lucky,
six shots out of six.

870
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:34,083
That's what I was willing to accept,

871
01:04:34,204 --> 01:04:36,127
then those guys took a run at me.

872
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:38,709
Whoever sent them made a mistake.

873
01:04:38,917 --> 01:04:41,261
It was just a bar fight.

874
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,716
Maybe.

875
01:04:43,755 --> 01:04:46,599
Or maybe someone got nervous,
tried to run me off.

876
01:04:47,092 --> 01:04:51,393
Or put me in a coma,
right next to their patsy.

877
01:04:54,265 --> 01:04:55,767
Patsy?

878
01:04:57,102 --> 01:04:59,730
It was such a great crime scene.

879
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:01,781
No one stopped to think
it might be too great.

880
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:03,404
<i>Not Emerson.</i>

881
01:05:03,566 --> 01:05:05,239
<i>Not your father.</i>

882
01:05:05,610 --> 01:05:07,954
<i>Not even Barr's own defence attorney.</i>

883
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,287
<i>But Barr knew I would,</i>

884
01:05:12,951 --> 01:05:15,625
no matter how much
I wanted it to be true.

885
01:05:17,580 --> 01:05:19,332
That's why he asked for me.

886
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,297
Wait.

887
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:23,677
Are you suggesting...

888
01:05:23,753 --> 01:05:25,926
James Barr is innocent.

889
01:05:35,306 --> 01:05:37,104
You can see what this is, can't you?

890
01:05:38,143 --> 01:05:39,611
You've got a case in your hands

891
01:05:39,686 --> 01:05:41,814
that may be
the last case you'll ever have

892
01:05:42,981 --> 01:05:45,780
and you'll do anything
not to hit the bottom of it.

893
01:05:47,485 --> 01:05:48,611
Helen.

894
01:05:49,612 --> 01:05:51,455
You know,
you never should have retired.

895
01:05:51,656 --> 01:05:53,158
Just, look. Listen.

896
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:54,746
For all I know, you were
standing at an intersection

897
01:05:54,826 --> 01:05:56,306
with a cardboard sign three days ago.

898
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,625
And I hired you.
Jesus, my father was right.

899
01:05:59,164 --> 01:06:01,792
- Helen. Helen.
- It makes total sense now.

900
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,710
It's the way you live,
the way you move around.

901
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:06,467
You're just not cut out
for the real world, are you?

902
01:06:06,796 --> 01:06:08,048
Are you afraid you'll end up like Barr?

903
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,371
- Helen.
- Is that what this is?

904
01:06:09,466 --> 01:06:10,513
Look out the window.

905
01:06:10,675 --> 01:06:11,972
No, I have work to do.

906
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:13,303
- And you need to leave.
- Just humour me. Okay.

907
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:14,892
Let go of me.

908
01:06:16,514 --> 01:06:18,482
- Would you tell me what you see?
- I see the same

909
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:22,149
things I see every day.

910
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:24,355
Well, imagine you've never seen it.

911
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:28,861
Imagine you've spent your whole life
in other parts of the world

912
01:06:29,194 --> 01:06:31,697
being told every day
you're defending freedom.

913
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:34,161
And finally
you decide you've had enough.

914
01:06:35,033 --> 01:06:38,253
Time to see
what you've given up your whole life for.

915
01:06:38,453 --> 01:06:40,956
Maybe get some of that freedom
for yourself.

916
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,129
Look at the people.

917
01:06:45,710 --> 01:06:47,712
Now tell me which ones are free.

918
01:06:49,297 --> 01:06:50,970
Free from debt.

919
01:06:51,382 --> 01:06:52,634
Anxiety.

920
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:53,969
Stress.

921
01:06:54,052 --> 01:06:55,304
Fear.

922
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:59,061
Failure. Indignity. Betrayal.

923
01:07:01,559 --> 01:07:04,563
How many wish they were born
knowing what they know now?

924
01:07:04,646 --> 01:07:06,819
Ask yourself how many would do things

925
01:07:06,898 --> 01:07:08,571
the same way all over again?

926
01:07:09,651 --> 01:07:12,029
And how many would
live their lives like me?

927
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:18,205
Now look at the silver Audi
across the street,

928
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,252
the one that's been following me all day.

929
01:07:20,578 --> 01:07:21,921
What does that prove?

930
01:07:21,996 --> 01:07:25,421

01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:04,316
<i>If you believe someone
could frame Barr,</i>

1086
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:06,769
<i>you have to believe
they could do the same to me.</i>

1087
01:25:06,893 --> 01:25:08,566
I suppose that's possible.

1088
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,773
She was a sweet kid, Helen.

1089
01:25:12,941 --> 01:25:14,943
And they killed her because of me.

1090
01:25:16,278 --> 01:25:17,951
They want me to run.

1091
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,032
But I won't.

1092
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,039
<i>- I'm going to finish this.</i>
- No, that's not a good idea.

1093
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:24,210
<i>Listen.</i>

1094
01:25:24,411 --> 01:25:27,415
Two things. One, I, uh...

1095
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,917
I stole your car.

1096
01:25:30,917 --> 01:25:32,590
<i>If you want to end this,</i>

1097
01:25:32,711 --> 01:25:34,054
just hang up the phone
and report it missing.

1098
01:25:34,129 --> 01:25:35,301
And I'll understand.

1099
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:36,807
And anything else?

1100
01:25:37,466 --> 01:25:39,685
I thought I'd be pushing it
if I mentioned this earlier.

1101
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:41,637
Now I guess all bets are off.

1102
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,939
You need to watch what you say
to Emerson and your father.

1103
01:25:45,140 --> 01:25:46,562
<i>I think one of them is in on it.</i>

1104
01:25:46,642 --> 01:25:48,986
All right. Thanks for calling. I have to go.

1105
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:51,150
<i>Wait. I've been followed from day one.</i>

1106
01:25:53,106 --> 01:25:54,779
Only three people knew I was here.

1107
01:25:54,941 --> 01:25:57,160
<i>Emerson, your father and you.</i>

1108
01:25:58,153 --> 01:26:00,030
<i>You need to ask yourself,</i>

1109
01:26:00,113 --> 01:26:01,956
<i>who has the most to lose
if we clear Barr?</i>

1110
01:26:03,992 --> 01:26:06,336
<i>Who tried to warn you off me?</i>

1111
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:10,332
<i>Of course, I could be wrong.
If you think I am,</i>

1112
01:26:10,457 --> 01:26:12,084
<i>just hand over the phone.</i>

1113
01:26:12,167 --> 01:26:13,669
There's no sense getting any deeper.

1114
01:26:14,961 --> 01:26:16,133
Who's that you're talking to?

1115
01:26:17,172 --> 01:26:18,594
The office.

1116
01:26:22,344 --> 01:26:23,812
Are we done?

1117
01:26:24,012 --> 01:26:25,138
Helen, listen.

1118
01:26:25,597 --> 01:26:26,718
- We need to...
- Good night.

1121
01:27:43,925 --> 01:27:45,927
You got some fine shooters here.

1122
01:27:46,595 --> 01:27:48,597
Fine as frog's hair.

1123
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,273
Rarer, too.

1124
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:54,066
'Cause most of them fellas out there
can't shoot worth a damn.

1125
01:27:54,603 --> 01:27:58,278
You ask them to put
three rounds in the black, well,

1126
01:27:58,940 --> 01:28:00,613
they'll suck it.

1127
01:28:03,069 --> 01:28:06,414
- I'm looking for the owner.
- That'd be me. Martin Cash.

1128
01:28:06,615 --> 01:28:08,117
Aaron Ward.

1129
01:28:08,408 --> 01:28:10,376
What can I do you for,
Mr Ward? Ward?

1130
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:14,002
Yeah. I'm looking for a friend of mine.
We served in Iraq.

1131
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,800
The guy just dropped
off the grid, you know?

1132
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:17,880
- It happens. Yep.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1133
01:28:17,959 --> 01:28:19,256
Anyway, he was a shooter.

1134
01:28:19,377 --> 01:28:20,970
Last I heard, he lived
around here somewhere and I...

1135
01:28:21,129 --> 01:28:23,097
When did he get out of the Army?

1136
01:28:24,633 --> 01:28:26,306
Well, I didn't say the Army.

1137
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:29,430
Well, you said you served with him.
You're no jarhead.

1138
01:28:29,638 --> 01:28:32,141
Man on a flying horse could see that.

1139
01:28:32,265 --> 01:28:34,438
Well, my father was in the Corps,
if that helps.

1140
01:28:34,643 --> 01:28:37,487
Well, <font color="#D900D9">(CHUCKLES)</font>
that makes you half human.

1141
01:28:39,105 --> 01:28:40,277
Your friend got a name?

1142
01:28:40,732 --> 01:28:42,575
Yeah. James Barr.

1143
01:28:43,819 --> 01:28:45,162
James Barr.

1144
01:28:45,821 --> 01:28:47,073
Never heard of him.

1145
01:28:48,448 --> 01:28:49,950
I think you have.

1146
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:53,002
I think you've been dreading the moment

1147
01:28:53,119 --> 01:28:55,167
some cop comes in here
asking after him.

1148
01:28:55,497 --> 01:28:58,171
Because it's for sure
some soccer mom around here

1149
01:28:58,291 --> 01:29:02,637
is more worried about your range than
she is about the pool in her backyard

1150
01:29:02,838 --> 01:29:05,307
or the drain cleaner under her sink.

1151
01:29:06,842 --> 01:29:10,187
Wouldn't matter to her
if Barr did his killing 100 miles away,

1152
01:29:10,262 --> 01:29:12,139
only that he came hereto rehearse.

1153
01:29:12,264 --> 01:29:13,811
She'd have a case to shut you down

1154
01:29:14,683 --> 01:29:16,856
and nothing better to do.

1155
01:29:17,811 --> 01:29:18,858
What do you want?

1156
01:29:20,480 --> 01:29:22,323
I want to know who Barr's friends were.

1157
01:29:26,486 --> 01:29:27,612
Those boys out there,

1158
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:31,663
they're mighty touchy when it comes
to their constitutional rights.

1159
01:29:32,367 --> 01:29:35,871
Suppose I tell them a cop is in here
asking after my members?

1160
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:37,960
- I'm not a cop.
- What are you?

1161
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:39,131
I work for Barr's attorney.

1162
01:29:39,207 --> 01:29:41,050
We have reason to believe
he's innocent.

1163
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:42,259
The hell you say.

1164
01:29:42,335 --> 01:29:47,057
Be that as it may, I'm the only one
who's bothered to track him this far.

1165
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:51,846
You help me out, I'll be in your debt.

1166
01:29:52,220 --> 01:29:53,312
And if I don't?

1167
01:29:55,390 --> 01:29:57,313
Maybe you can coach soccer.

1168
01:30:02,063 --> 01:30:05,067
You put three in the centre
and maybe we'll talk.

1169
01:30:07,861 --> 01:30:09,158
Can I have a few to warm up?

That's your mulligan, Mr Ward.

You're a little rusty, Mr Reacher.

1175
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,840
I saw a man by that name
shoot for the Wimbledon Cup,

1176
01:32:33,965 --> 01:32:35,558
what, ten years ago.

1177
01:32:36,051 --> 01:32:39,021
And I'm pretty sure you never
played second base for the Yankees

1178
01:32:39,554 --> 01:32:41,227
in 1925.

1179
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:43,729
Now,

1180
01:32:44,726 --> 01:32:46,228
I'll answer one question.

1181
01:32:47,353 --> 01:32:48,696
Who's your best shooter?

1182
01:32:50,190 --> 01:32:51,407
James Barr.

1183
01:32:54,903 --> 01:32:57,656
I pulled all these down
as soon as I heard about the shooting.

1184
01:33:02,744 --> 01:33:04,667
That's the best shot

1185
01:33:04,746 --> 01:33:06,919
I ever seen this side of civilian life.

1186
01:33:07,916 --> 01:33:12,342
Suppose I told you Barr wasn't this
good on his best day in the Army.

1187
01:33:12,420 --> 01:33:15,515
I handed out those targets myself.
That's my scrawl on every one.

1188
01:33:15,590 --> 01:33:17,592
Do you hang them downrange, too?

1189
01:33:17,926 --> 01:33:19,599
What, are you serious?

1190
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:23,105
I'm saying
it's possible that Barr had a friend.

1191
01:33:23,556 --> 01:33:25,196
One who switched the targets
on the range.

1192
01:33:25,225 --> 01:33:26,568
Maybe Barr let him.

1193
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:29,942
Made him feel like King Shit
having his name up on your wall.

1194
01:33:30,063 --> 01:33:34,443
I never saw one real shooter
who would do that for his own mother.

1195
01:33:35,944 --> 01:33:38,948
Unless he was framing his mother
for multiple murder

1196
01:33:40,281 --> 01:33:42,124
and using your range to do it.

1197
01:33:45,453 --> 01:33:47,581
Barr didn't come alone, did he?

1198
01:33:49,415 --> 01:33:52,760
You know, one of these nuts is likely
to kill you, they find that camera, there.

1199
01:33:52,961 --> 01:33:54,008
Hell, the camera's there

1200
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:56,431
'cause one of these nuts
is likely to kill me.

1201
01:33:58,424 --> 01:33:59,596
There's Barr.

1202
01:34:00,635 --> 01:34:02,888
I always liked him. Always liked him.

1203
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,063
There.

1204
01:34:05,098 --> 01:34:06,270
Him.

This is just
what I could pull this morning.

1216
01:34:38,464 --> 01:34:42,435
Tax records, city and state
permit applications, contract bids.

Shell corporation in Georgia.

That's the one next to Russia,
not Florida.

1219
01:34:47,473 --> 01:34:51,194
They work one city at a time,
acquiring a local construction concern

1220
01:34:51,477 --> 01:34:53,320
just ahead of major civic redevelopment.

1221
01:34:53,521 --> 01:34:57,196
They build bridges no one needs.
Highways no one uses.

1222
01:34:57,525 --> 01:35:02,031
They're like a cancer.
A cell that won't stop growing.

1223
01:35:03,698 --> 01:35:07,202
They moved 12 times in 15 years.

Always amidst allegations of corruption

including millions of dollars
in missing public funds.

1227
01:35:17,045 --> 01:35:21,391
And yet never an investigation.
Never even an inquiry.

1228
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:25,558
It's as if Lebendauer Enterprises
were above reproach.

1229
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:32,143
<font color="#D900D9">(SIGHS)</font> Well, maybe that's because

1230
01:35:33,645 --> 01:35:36,023
the allegations come
from the competition.

1231
01:35:37,398 --> 01:35:39,025
Outbid. Bitter.

1232
01:35:39,567 --> 01:35:41,069
Like Oline Archer.

1233
01:35:41,569 --> 01:35:44,994
Or maybe Lebendauer
has the cooperation of key officials.

1234
01:35:45,073 --> 01:35:48,043
And maybe
when that cooperation isn't enough,

1235
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:51,663
they kill people who won't be bought off.
