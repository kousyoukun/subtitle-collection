[ 女人#2 ] 你计划了这整件事.
You planned this whole thing.

5
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:14,795
[ 女人#1 ] 我们樽约核做的决定付出代价
We make our own choice. We pay our own prices.

是的老板, 我已经全查过一扁了

我不觉得那里会有什么问题
I don't think there should be any problems.

是老板, 我整理了那些桶并且查过了浴室
Yes, sir, I ordered the vanity and I looked at the tub.

我叫克尔奇.
I'm Corky.

31

听说你在这儿上班, 所以我想...
I heard you working in here, and I was wondering...

32
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:12,935
请你喝杯咖啡.
if you'd like a cup of coffee.

33

请进来.
Come on in.

等我一下.
Just give me a second.

好的.
All right.

37
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:28,295
拉吉夫怎么了?
What happened to Rajiv?

00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:32,465
他回去印度或其他地方了, 但是不久就会回来了.
He went home to India or someplace, but I think he'll be back.

39
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:35,555
那你这份工只是暂时性的?
So this is just a temporary situation for you?

40
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:38,595
是啊, 大概是那样. 一天一次.
Yeah, pretty much. One day at a time.

41
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,855
我觉得你是个耿直的人.
I guessed you're a straight black.

42
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:44,315
猜的不错.
Good guess.

43

不客气.
My pleasure.

45
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:52,235
老实说, 我是有个隐藏动机.
To be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive.

46
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,155
我在想不知道可不可以请你帮个忙.
I was wondering if I might ask you a little favor.

47
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:57,245
帮忙.  是啊.
Favor.   Yeah.

48
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:59,915
我是个过惯夜生活的人, 所以我想...
I'm kind of a night person, and I was wondering...

49
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:04,335
不知道你能不能等迟一些再用你那强力的工具.
if you might wait a little bit before you start using the power tools.

50
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:07,095
啊, 对不起.  嗯, 没关系. 没关系.
Oh, sorry.   Oh, no. No.

51
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:12,135
不是你的错. 实在是这里的墙壁太薄了.
It's not your fault. It's just the walls here are so terribly thin.

52
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:16,435
真的.  就象是在同一间房似的.
Really.   It's like you're in the same room.

53
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:18,775
可是如果那太麻烦的话就没关系啦.
If it's too much trouble, I understand.

54
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:21,775
啊不麻烦. 我还有其他的事情可以做.
It's no trouble at all. I got a lot to do here.

55
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:25,445
这些全是你一人的工作?
You doin' all the work yourself?

56
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,325
太令人敬佩了.
That is so amazing.

57
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:31,705
我很佩服那些善于修理东西的人.
I am so in awe of people who can fix things.

58
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:36,165
我爸也是那样. 我们从没买过新的东西.
My dad was like that. We never had anything new.

59
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,085
每当有东西坏了, 他就会...
Whenever anything was broken, he would just...

60
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:42,885
把它打开来, 弄一弄看...
open it up, tinker with it a little bit...

61
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,475
再把它修好.
and fix it.

62
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,845
他有一双很巧的手.
His hands were magic.

00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:51,565
我敢打赌, 你这汽车有20年了吧.
I'll bet your car is 20 years old.

67
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:06,955
嗯, 我觉得我该走了.
Well, I guess I should be going.

68
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:09,455
你有空的话可以随时过来.
You can drop the cup off at any time.

我洗碗后放掉水时不小心把耳环掉下去了.
I was doing the dishes, and just as I pulled the stopper, my earring fell in.

123
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:54,445
所以我现在很沮丧. 那是我最喜欢的东西之一啊.
That's why I got upset. It's one of my favorites.

I can't thank you enough. You have to let me pay you something.

不必了.  不必?
No.   No ?

Told Bianchini I'd do it. I did it.

如果你不想收钱的话, 请你喝杯东西如何?
If you won't take money, how about a drink?

133
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,035
你不可能整个晚上都在忙的吧.
You can't work all night.

00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,775
坐吧.
Sit down.

141
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:45,005
谢了.
Thanks.

142
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:47,095
你看起来不太舒服.
You seem uncomfortable.

143
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:50,425
是不是因为我而紧张啊, 克尔奇?
Do I make you nervous, Corky?

144
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:52,095
不是.
No.

145
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:54,685
也许是口渴.
Thirsty, maybe.

146
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,275
也许是好奇.
Curious, maybe.

147
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:03,445
真有趣. 我自己觉得有点好奇呢.
That's funny. I'm feeling a little bit curious myself.

148
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:07,615
真棒的纹身.
That's a great tattoo.

149
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:14,745
真漂亮的战斧
Beautiful labris.

150
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:17,165
我知道那是什么你是不是很惊讶?
Are you surprised I know what it is?

151
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:18,545
也许吧.
Maybe.

152
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:31,975
我也有纹身.
I have a tattoo.

153
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:36,025
有没有兴趣看看啊?
Would you like to see it?

154
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:43,245
一个在纽约市区附近的女人帮我纹的.
A woman in upstate New York did it for me.

155
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,995
你喜欢吗?
Do you like it?

156
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:50,215
她花了一整天的功夫弄的.
Took her all day to do it.

157
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:54,795
她担保说不会疼的, 可是...
She promised it wouIdn't hurt, but...

158
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,975
我还是痛了好一阵子.
it was sore for a long time after.

159
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:02,395
连轻轻摸都会疼.
I couldn't even touch it.

160
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:07,105
可现在我喜欢摸上去的感觉.
Now I love the way it feels.

161
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,445
这里.
Here.

162
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:17,575
摸摸看.
Touch it.

163
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:30,635
你在干嘛?  你看不出来?
What are you doing?   Isn't it obvious?

164
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,225
我在引诱你.
I'm trying to seduce you.

165
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:36,935
为什么?
Why?

166
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:39,065
因为我想要你.
Because I want to.

167
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:43,905
当天在电梯里头碰面时我就已经想要你了.
I've wanted to ever since I saw you that day in the elevator.

168
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:52,285
我知道你可能不相信...
I know you don't believe me...

169
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,375
但是我可以证明给你看.
but I can prove it to you.

170
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,015
你将不会相信你接下来所看到的
You can't believe what you'd see...

171
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:09,815
但是你能够相信你所能感觉到的.
but you can believe what you feel.

172
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:18,905
自那天起我无时无刻都在想着你.
I've been thinking about you all day.

173
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:24,415
[ 喘气, 呻吟 ]

174
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,975
这整件事是个圈套.
You planned this whole thing.

175
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:41,855
你故意把耳环丢进洗手盆的, 对吧?
You dropped that earring down the sink on purpose, didn't you?

176
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:46,145
如果我说是的话, 你会不会就把手拿开了?
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?

177
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:50,485
不会.  是的.
No.   Yes.

178
00:14:54,865 --> 00:14:56,865
噢, 啊, 克尔奇.
Oh, please, Corky.

179
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:58,455
噢, 啊.
Oh, please.

180
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:01,625
吻我!
Kiss me!

181
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:24,195
[ 喘气声持续着 ]

182
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:31,955
[ 开门声 ]  哦, 他妈的!
Oh, fuck!

183
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:38,835
维雅乐! 维, 你在家吗?
Violet! Vi, you home?

184
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:41,005
在, 我在这儿, 凯
Yeah, I'm right here, C.

185
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:47,305
这是什么?  我没有
What the fuck is this?   I didn't

186
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:48,895
这是什么混账
What the fuck is

187
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:52,775
哦.
Oh.

188
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:55,235
克尔奇, 这位是凯撒. 凯撒, 克尔奇.
Corky, this is Caesar. Caesar, Corky.

189
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:58,905
[ 笑声 ] 我以为
I thought

190
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:02,825
这里真他妈的暗.
It's fuckin' dark in here.

191
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,745
克尔奇在帮卞齐倪先生办事.
Corky's doing some work for Mr. Bianchini.

192
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:10,875
哦, 真的, 嗯. 别跟我说那些.
Oh, yeah. Right. Don mentioned that to me.

193
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:14,295
对不起, 嗨.
I'm sorry. Hi.

194
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:15,925
欢迎你加入这个家族.
Welcome to the family.

195
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:20,185
你, 跟拉吉夫一起上班, 对吧?
So you're working with Rajiv, right?

196
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:22,605
不, 拉吉夫在印度.
No. Rajiv's in India.

197
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:24,725
她自己一个人做工.
She's doing the work herself.

198
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:26,185
哦, 是这样.
No shit.

199
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:29,315
卞齐倪请了你. 那你的手艺肯定不错.
Bianchini hired you. You must be pretty good with your hands.

200
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,775
他是我的好朋友.  维雅乐也是这么说的.
He's a good friend of mine.   That's what Violet says.

201
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,235
正确来说是家族.
Family really.

202
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:36,615
你什么时候被放出来的?  老天, 凯撒.
When did you get out?   Jesus, Caesar.

203
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:39,085
啥? 那又不是什么大不了的.
What? It ain't no big fuckin' deal.

204
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,455
我知道阿当雇佣的人.
I know who Don hires.

205
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:45,465
你知道的, 他自己也被抓过. 十三年了.
You know, he did time himself. Thirteen fuckin' years.

206
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,255
你呢? 多久?
What did you do?

207
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:51,305
五.  五.
Five.   Five.

208
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,845
那不坏啊. 因为什么事被抓?
That's not bad. What for?

209
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:56,315
那根本都不关你事.
That's none of your goddamn business.

210
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:59,025
你们俩都说的对, 根本不关我事.
You're right. She's right. It's none of my goddamn business.

211
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:01,605
你可以不必告诉我. 只是
You don't have to tell me. It's just

212
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,905
我只想告诉你一件事, 好吗?
I want you to understand one thing, all right?

213
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,695
你是这里少数的好人之一.
You're amongst good people here.

214
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:16,755
来吧, 来吧.
Come on, come on.

215
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:21,135
假如你了解我说什么的话, 你会收下这钱的.
If you understand what I'm talkin' about, you'll take the money.

216
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:24,635
否则我真的为你担心了.
If you don't, then I'm gonna have to worry about you.

217
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:31,475
很好. 我不喜欢担心别人.
Good. I hate to worry.

218
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:34,145
我长了口疮.
I got ulcers.

219
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,825
我看我还是应该走了.
I should be going.

220
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:41,705
啥? 不行, 留下来. 请她喝东西.
What? No, stick around. Get her a drink.

221
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:44,415
我还得回去清理刷子.
I gotta go clean out my brushes.

222
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:45,915
下次吧.
Another time.

223
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:49,165
好. 下次.
Right. Another time.

224
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:10,775
唔, 克尔奇, 克尔奇. 你在干嘛?
Mmm, Corky, Corky. What are you doing?

225
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:37,435
我想见你.
I had to see you.

226
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:41,195
呃. 我不觉得那是个好主意.
Look. I don't think this is a good idea.

227
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:43,615
我想跟你道歉.
I wanted to apologize.

228
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:48,365
不, 千万别道歉.
No, please, don't apologize.

229
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:51,705
如果有什么是我所不能忍受的事, 那就是女人为了性爱而道歉.
If there's one thing I can't stand it's woman who apologize for wanting sex.

230
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,675
我不是为了我所做的而道歉.
I'm not apologizing for what I did.

231
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:05,345
我是为了我所没做的而道歉.
I'm apologizing for what I didn't do.

232
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,375
你知道那里有床吗?
You have a bed somewhere?

233
00:19:56,455 --> 00:19:59,415
[ 呻吟 ]

234
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:08,345
[ 喘气 ]

235
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:34,415
[ 呻吟, 喘气持续着 ]

236
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:07,045
我的视力恢复了.
I can see again.

237
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:28,525
我正需要它.
I needed that.

238
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:33,155
那 凯撒是黑社会吗?
So Caesar's Mafia, huh?

239
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:35,115
还需要问吗?
You have to ask?

240
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,995
不.
No.

241
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,285
有趣.
Funny.

242
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,495
好久没人那么叫了.
Nobody really calls it that anymore.

243
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:42,795
凯撒只称它为 "生意".
Caesar just calls it "the business."

244
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,215
你怎么与见他的?
How did you meet him?

245
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:48,215
他们接管一间夜总会, 我当时在那里上班.
They took over a club I was working at.

246
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:50,175
凯撒当时是主管.
Caesar started managing it.

247
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:53,345
他帮人洗黑钱?  基本上是.
He's a launderer?   Basically.

248
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:55,145
你跟他在一起多久了?
How long you been with him?

249
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:57,775
大概五年了.
About five years.

250
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:02,195
五年不短啊.
Five years is a long time.

251
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:04,195
是啊.
Yes, it is.

252
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,655
财富的重新分配.
The redistribution of wealth.

253
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:11,325
那不是你所想知道的吗?
Excuse me?   Isn't it what you wanted to know?

254
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,375
我为什么被抓?
What I did time for?

255
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:16,545
"财富的重新分配."?
"The redistribution of wealth?"

256
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,585
那是我一向说来骗人上床的.
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.

257
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:22,465
可是我已经在你床上了.
But I'm already in your bed.

258
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:28,805
我狱里的朋友说她花时间被抓.
My cell mate would say she did her time for getting caught.

259
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:31,645
她一向比我诚实多了.
She was always a lot more honest than me.

260
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:36,025
你假如不愿意的话可以不必告诉我.
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.

261
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,155
我想我愿意.
I guess I wanted to.

262
00:22:42,115 --> 00:22:43,825
我很高兴你这么做.
I'm glad you did.

263
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:46,915
我也是.
So am I.

264
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,265
叮 让我告诉你我所认识的一个女孩 叮
*  Let me tell you about a girl I know *

265
00:22:57,305 --> 00:23:00,305
叮 她是我的宝贝并且住在我隔壁 叮
*  She is my baby and she lives next door *

266
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,605
叮 每天早上太阳没出来前 叮
*  Every mornin' before the sun comes up *

267
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:05,935
叮 她用我最爱的杯子泡咖啡给我 叮
*  She brings my coffee in my favorite cup *

268
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:09,445
叮 我就是那样才知道的... 叮  你以为我不知道?
*  That's why I know... *   You think I don't know that?

269
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:11,025
噢, 别这样.
Please. Come on.

270
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:13,575
你可以 我今晚得离开.
Will you just   I have to leave tonight.

271
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:17,035
我求求你, 维雅乐.
Don't make me beg, Violet.

272
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,125
两分钟. 谢谢.
Two minutes. Thank you.

273
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:24,165
[ 开琐声 ]

274
00:23:29,345 --> 00:23:32,885
[ 敲门声 ]  [ 开门声 ]

275
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:34,475
喂, 维雅乐.
Hey, Violet.

276
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:36,145
你今天气色不错.
You look great.

277
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:46,535
[ 低沉的呻吟 ]

278
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:54,245
[ 维雅乐 ] 你的身影一直在我脑海里.
I had this image of you inside of me.

279
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,625
象是我的一部分.
Like a part of me.

280
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:02,005
你是如此的美丽.
You are so beautiful.

281
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:07,095
怎么了?  没事.
What's wrong?   Nothing.

282
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:13,525
不, 你有事的. 你不想见我是不是?
Yes, there is. You didn't want to see me, did you?

283
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:16,565
我很难能忍受我自己跟一个女人睡了后...
If there's one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women...

284
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:18,615
我就开始胡思乱想.
it's all the fucking mind reading.

285
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:22,785
我不知道.  我懂的, 维雅乐.
I don't understand.   I know, Violet.

286
00:24:22,865 --> 00:24:25,745
那是因为你不会了解的, 我们是不同的.
That's 'cause you can't understand. We're different.

287
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:28,085
我们没那么不同, 克尔奇.
We're not that different, Corky.

288
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,965
啊, 拭目以待吧.
Ah, let's see.

289
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:33,965
现在, 你该告诉我...
This is the part where you tell me...

290
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:36,425
你心里有什么烦恼...
what matters is on the inside...

291
00:24:36,465 --> 00:24:39,725
还是你心理有个我的影子.
and that inside of you there's a little dyke just like me.

292
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:43,815
不, 她不象你. 她比你聪明的多了.
No, she's nothing like you. She's a whole lot smarter than you are.

293
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:45,895
她爸爸跟她说了什么?
Is that what her daddy tells her?

294
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:50,315
我知道我是谁. 用不着把它纹在肩膀上.
I know what I am. I don't have to have it tattooed on my shoulder.

295
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,405
你是说你不跟男人上床?  我不啊.
You saying you don't have sex with men?   I don't.

296
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,455
[ 冷笑 ]

297
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,835
天啊, 我听到了. 墙壁很薄, 记得吗?
For Christ's sake, I heard you. Thin walls, remember?

298
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:03,165
你听到的不是性爱.
What you heard wasn't sex.

299
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:06,505
那是什么?
What was it?

300
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,175
工作.
Work.

301
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:15,055
生命中总有得付出的选择.
You made certain choices in your life that you paid for.

302
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:18,815
你说你干这行是因为你很在行...
You said you made them because you were good at something...

303
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:20,775
并且容易.
and it was easy.

304
00:25:20,815 --> 00:25:23,565
我对我这行也很在行.
You think you're the only person that's good at something?

305
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:29,075
我们为自己做的选择付出代价
We make our own choices. We pay our own prices.

306
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:31,785
虽然你不想承认, 我觉得我们很多地方很相似
I think we're more alike than you care to admit.

307
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:34,165
那今天早上那个男的呢?
What about that guy this morning?

308
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,295
雪丽?
Shelly?

309
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:39,135
别告诉我, 你真是个工作狂.
Don't tell me. You're a workaholic.

310
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:43,965
不是的, 雪丽知道我是怎么样的一个人. 他见到我跟另一个女人在酒吧里.
No, Shelly knows what I am. He saw me in a bar with another woman.

311
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:49,145
哦, 那么他纯粹只想看看.
Yeah. I suppose he just wants to watch.

312
00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:52,435
去你的. 你马上跟我离开.
Fuck it. I think you'd better leave.

313
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:54,485
是的, 我想也是时候离开了.
Yeah, I think I'd better.

314
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:58,485
离开时别偷走任何东西.
Try not to steal anything on the way out.

315
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:18,715
[ 隔墙的男人#1 ] 你他妈的这是什么?
Where the fuck is it?

316
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:21,635
[ 隔墙的男人#2 ] 不是我做的! 我可以发誓!
I didn't do it! I swear to you!

317
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:25,425
[ 撞击声 ]

318
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:29,645
[ 隔墙的男人#2 ] 相信我吧!
Come on!

319
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:31,645
[ 隔墙的男人#1 ] 东西在那?  [ 撞击声 ]
Where is it?

320
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:33,355
[ 隔墙的男人#1 ] 哦, 痛不痛啊?  [ 隔墙的男人#2 ] 啊!
Oh, that hurt, didn't it?   Ow!

321
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:38,405
[ 撞击声持续着 ]  [ 隔墙的男人#1 ] 你以为你骗得了我?
You think you're smart?

322
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:42,495
[ 隔墙的男人#1 ] 你到底把钱藏到哪去了?
Where's that fuckin' money?

323
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,285
[ 隔墙的男人#2 ] 住手, 住手!
Please, please!

324
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,955
求求你, 放过我吧!
Please, let me go!

325
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:48,415
住手啊! [ 惊叫声 ]
Please stop it!

326
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:53,085
[ 隔墙的男人#1 ] 别逼我做我不想做的事!
Don't make me beg!

327
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:55,135
住手! 求求你!
Stop it! Please!

328
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:59,935
住手!  想耍我们? 真有种, 耍我?
Please stop!   Tryin' to fuck us? You wanna fuck me?

329
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:03,605
你个烂货. 让我送你归西.
You piece of shit. We're goin' home.

330
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:06,775
没人可以耍他!  我没有在耍他啊!
Nobody fucks him!   I'm not fucking him!

331
00:28:06,855 --> 00:28:08,485
我可以向天发誓!
I swear to God!

332
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:10,025
强尼! 喂!
Johnnie! Ho!

333
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:13,655
他太吵了.
He's making too much noise.

334
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:15,825
听见没婊子? 闭嘴.
You hear that, bitch? Shut up.

335
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:21,165
给我条毛巾.
Give me a towel.

336
00:28:22,045 --> 00:28:23,665
闭嘴!
Shut up!

337
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:25,175
拿去.
Here.

338
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:28,845
塞住他的嘴.
Put it in his mouth.

339
00:28:42,735 --> 00:28:44,445
凯撒, 我走了.
Caesar, I'm leaving.

340
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:47,495
啥? 为什么要走?
What? Why?

341
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:51,745
真是的, 该用条更好的毛巾.  凯撒, 我是认真的.
I didn't use a good towel.   Caesar, I'm serious.

342
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:54,045
我受不了了. 我要离开.
I can't take this. I have to get out of here.

343
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,375
为什么?
Why?

344
00:28:56,665 --> 00:28:58,255
因为你认识他?
'Cause you know him?

345
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:00,925
啊, 懂了吧?
Aw, you see?

346
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:04,675
宝贝, 我迷的就是你这点.
Baby, that's what I love about you.

347
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:06,725
你太他妈敏感了.
You're so fuckin' sensitive.

348
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:11,105
可是我喜欢你在我身边.
But I like you here.

349
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:13,105
我要你留下来.
I want you to stay.

350
00:29:14,195 --> 00:29:16,615
这真叫我为难.
This is hard on me too.

351
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,195
我喜欢雪丽.
I like Shelly.

352
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:23,115
你去看看电视节目或者听听录音带吧
So why don't you watch some TV and put on a cassette or something?

353
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,465
没事吧, 维雅乐?
You okay, Violet?

354
00:29:33,845 --> 00:29:36,305
米奇, 强尼在这干嘛?
Mick, why is Johnnie here?

355
00:29:36,385 --> 00:29:39,095
你知道我对那神经病有多反感吗?
You know how I feel about that psycho fuck?

356
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,765
凯撒, 你帮我拿的东西呢?
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?

357
00:29:42,855 --> 00:29:45,395
哦, 我忘了. 这就去.
Sure. Sorry about that.

358
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,325
你不该看到这一切的.
You shouldn't have to see this.

359
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:53,945
一起出去走走吧?
Why don't you get out of here? Go for a walk.

360
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:57,285
凯撒要我留下来.
Caesar wants me to stay.

361
00:30:00,085 --> 00:30:03,795
别担心他, 让我来搞定.
Don't worry about Caesar. I'll handle Caesar.

362
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:07,135
走开.
Get out of here.

363
00:30:07,175 --> 00:30:09,805
[ 强尼 ] 让我们彻夜狂欢吧.  好的.
We can go all night, bitch.   Okay.

364
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:11,135
谢谢你, 米奇.
Thank you, Mickey.

365
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:13,135
[ 咒骂声 ]

366
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:14,475
喏, 去吧.
Here you go.

367
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:17,185
彻夜狂欢呐! 爽啊!
All fuckin' night, baby! All night!

368
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:21,025
[ 咒骂声持续 ]

369
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,445
放松点吧, 强尼, 好吗?
Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay?

370
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:32,075
婊子!
Bitch!

371
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:35,795
拉他起来.
Pick him up.

372
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:47,685
雪丽,
Shelly,

373
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:50,975
我只会问你十次, 了解吗?
I'm gonna ask you ten times. You understand?

374
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,435
十次.
Ten times.

375
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:55,525
是的 [ 笑声 ]
Yeah.

376
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:12,335
一. 钱在那里?
One. Where's our money?

377
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:14,965
[ 尖叫声 ]  [ 剪指头声 ]

378
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,095
[ 低沉惊叫声 ]

379
00:31:20,765 --> 00:31:22,685
[ 叹气声 ]

380
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:35,905
你还好吧?
You all right?

381
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:51,595
走吧. 咱们离开吧.
Come on. Let's get out of here.

382
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:57,225
[ 冷笑 ] 继续.
Keep it.

383
00:32:15,045 --> 00:32:17,045
雪丽在凯撒的生意上做了手脚.
Shelly was skimming from the business.

384
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:23,425
他怕凯撒发现所以来找我帮忙.
He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar found out.

385
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:26,225
他想我跟他一起逃离这里.
He wanted to run, but he wanted me to come with him.

386
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:28,515
他知道你的背景吗?
Even though he knew about you.

387
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:31,525
是的.  哦, 那他爱上你了?
Yeah.   This guy's in love with you?

388
00:32:31,605 --> 00:32:35,605
他是这么说, 可我觉得不是.
That's what he tells himself, but it's not even about me.

389
00:32:35,695 --> 00:32:39,535
他有很多逃走的机会, 可是他偏不走.
He could have run at any time, but he didn't want out.

390
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:41,615
听起来象是他故意被抓的样子.
It sounds like he wanted to get caught.

391
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:43,955
嗯, 可能他是故意的.
Yeah. Maybe he did.

392
00:32:44,035 --> 00:32:47,045
他常跟我吹牛.
He would brag to me all the time.

393
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:50,415
说他从没怕过凯撒, 因为...
He was never afraid of Caesar because...

394
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:52,085
他不了解他.
he didn't know him.

395
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:53,505
我也不了解.
Not like I do.

396
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:57,635
我以前能够撑的住的.
I used to be able to block it out.

397
00:32:59,015 --> 00:33:01,185
或者是我一直在欺骗我自己...
Or I'd just tell myself that...

398
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:04,855
说一切都是幻觉, 所以...
I wasn't really there, and so...

399
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,275
一点事情都没有.
none of it really mattered.

400
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:12,155
可是现在我办不到了.
But I can't do that anymore.

401
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,245
我在重复着雪丽的错误.
I'm making the same mistake Shelly made...

402
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:21,375
但我终于知道我需要的是什么了.
but now I know what I want.

403
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:27,545
我要离开.
I want out.

404
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,225
我要一个新的生活.
I want a new life.

405
00:33:34,975 --> 00:33:38,025
我终于知道我要的是什么, 可是我一个人办不到.
I see what I've been waiting for, but I can't do it alone.

406
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:47,445
我需要你的帮忙, 克尔奇.
I need your help, Corky.

407
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:55,585
凯撒会去取钱, 他将会把钱  多少钱?
Caesar's gonna get the money     How much money?

408
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:57,875
雪丽说超过二百万.
Shelly said it's over two million dollars.

409
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:04,095
对啊. 那凯撒将会拿那二百万.
Yeah. So Caesar's gonna get it.

410
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,395
他会把钱拿去公寓那里. 然后他会点算钱.
He's gonna bring it by the apartment. He's gonna count it.

411
00:34:07,475 --> 00:34:10,395
他将会查每本帐簿来了解雪丽是怎么做的手脚.
He's gonna go through the books and try and figure out how Shelly did it.

412
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:13,275
等等. 维雅乐, 你知不知道你在说什么?
Wait a minute. Violet, do you know what you're saying?

413
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:15,905
你要我帮你抢黑帮的钱?
You're asking me to help you fuck over the Mob.

414
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:19,365
维雅乐, 他们不是好惹的.
Violet, these people are serious.

415
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:22,155
假如你不了解就去问雪丽好了.
You wanna know how serious? Ask your friend Shelly.

416
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:25,955
他们比警察还利害,他们很有钱, 不怕法律.
They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.

417
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:28,085
你要跟他们对着干, 需要有万全的计划.
You fuck them, you better do it right.

418
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:31,215
所以我要你帮忙啊. 你说你很利害的.
That's why I need your help. You said you were good.

419
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:32,755
我是利害.
I am good.

420
00:34:35,845 --> 00:34:39,685
好那么现在假如我相信你说的一切.
Let's just say for a moment I believe everything you're saying.

421
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:42,265
你觉得我在说谎?  我没那样说.
You think I'm lying?   I didn't say that.

422
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:46,775
可是你有, 假设你有吧.
But since you did, let's say you are.

423
00:34:46,855 --> 00:34:49,445
你要算计雪丽其实是很容易的.
It would have been easy for you to set up Shelly.

424
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:51,155
差点让他被杀了...
You could have had him killed...

425
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:53,405
你知道凯撒会把钱拿回公寓去的.
knowing that Caesar would bring the money back to the apartment.

426
00:34:55,075 --> 00:34:58,245
你只是需要一个豪无干系的人来证明你的清白.
All you would need to keep yourself clean is someone unconnected.

427
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:01,125
好比说我.
Someone like me.

428
00:35:02,915 --> 00:35:05,005
你真的是那样想的?
Is that what you think?

429
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:07,095
我只是假设一下.
I'm just making a point.

430
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:11,975
你完全不了解...
You have no idea what you're asking...

431
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:17,185
两个人干这种事需要多少的互相信任.
how much trust it takes two people to do something like this.

432
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,945
对于我来说, 偷窃跟性爱差不多.
For me, stealing has always been a lot like sex.

433
00:35:24,195 --> 00:35:26,695
两个人要同样的东西.
Two people who want the same thing.

434
00:35:26,735 --> 00:35:29,285
他们走进一间房, 开始讨论.
They get in a room, they talk about it.

435
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:32,955
当他们开始计划时, 好比调情一样.
They start to plan. It's like flirting.

436
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:37,165
就象是前奏一般.
It's kind of like foreplay.

437
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:40,595
因为讲的越多, 他们就越兴奋.
Because the more they talk about it, the wetter they get.

438
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:46,635
唯一不同的是, 我可以随意跟人上床.
The only difference is, I can fuck someone I've just met.

439
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:52,145
可是计划偷东西的话, 我得要一个我非常了解的人.
But to steal, I need to know someone like I know myself.

440
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:55,855
你觉得你够了解我了吗?
You think you know me like that?

441
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,575
我要看看那些钱.
I wanna see the money.

442
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,285
喔, 老天!
Oh, my God!

443
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,415
别担心. 不是我的.
Don't worry. It ain't mine.

444
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:17,765
凯撒, 怎么了?  真是难以置信啊, 维.
Caesar, what happened?   It was unbelievable, Vi.

445
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:19,885
真他妈的难以置信!
Un fuckin' believable!

446
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:22,935
妈的! 看看这件衣服.
Shit! Look at this shirt.

447
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,065
你看看. 不能用了.
Look at it. It's ruined.

448
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:27,695
这一切都是当雪丽带我们去看钱时开始的.
It all started when Shelly took us to the money.

449
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:30,565
我跟你说啊米奇, 他真不是盖的.
I'll tell you something. Mickey, he knows his shit.

450
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,615
他真行. 让雪丽带我们去到了那里.
He does. Shelly took us right there.

451
00:36:32,695 --> 00:36:35,325
然后他跪了下来, 嗯...
So Shelly's down on his knees, right...

452
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:38,785
从地上的一个保险箱里拿出了这些钱...
and he's pulling out this money from a safe on the floor...

453
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:40,375
我当时在那...就站在那里...
and I'm standin' there...

454
00:36:40,455 --> 00:36:42,545
傻...傻呼呼的看着那些钱, 你知道吗?
and I'm lookin' at it, right?

455
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:44,795
象是在说,"太爽了!"
Like, "Holy fuck!"

456
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:50,345
我当时只想到, "他是怎么办到的," 然后枪声响了!
All I can think about is, "How the fuck was he able to do this," when bang!

457
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:53,515
强尼射了他. 他杀了雪丽!
Johnny caps him. He caps Shelly!

458
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:56,765
血溅的到处都是. 溅了我一身. 钱上也全是血.
Blood goes flyin' everywhere. All over me. All over the money.

459
00:36:56,855 --> 00:36:59,985
我脑子一片空白. 不知道他开了多少枪.
I have no idea if this is even all of it.

460
00:37:02,025 --> 00:37:05,365
然后我冲出去就是一拳!
And right then, I go through the roof and bam!

461
00:37:05,445 --> 00:37:07,365
我打了那个狗娘养的.
I punch the dumb son of a bitch.

462
00:37:07,445 --> 00:37:09,915
我对着他那张傻脸用力的打下去.
I punch him right in his dumb fuckin' face.

463
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,995
当时我根本不理会他是谁的儿子.
I didn't give a shit whose son he was.

464
00:37:12,035 --> 00:37:16,335
我只想着继续揍他揍醒这狗娘养的傻小子!
I just wanted to hit him again   smack some sense into the dumb son of a bitch!

465
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,505
看看我现在得面对这糟糕的处境!
Look at the shit that I gotta fuckin' deal with now!

466
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:22,715
你现在想怎么办呢?  我叫他直接照平时那样办.
What are you gonna do with it?   I told him to run it through the cycle.

467
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:25,935
可是, 强尼打给他老头子, 我觉得他有其他的计划...
But no, Johnnie calls up the old man, and I guess he's got other plans...

468
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:28,935
他明天晚上才要这些东西
because he wants to pick up this shit tomorrow night.

469
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:35,525
洗衣服的清洁剂在那?
Where's the laundry detergent?

470
00:37:35,565 --> 00:37:37,575
在床单柜理.
It's in the linen cabinet.

471
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:47,705
[ 水滴声 ]

472
00:37:57,425 --> 00:38:00,435
记得明天一大早到我那去.
Come to my place in the morning, early.

473
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:05,525
[ 维雅乐 ] 你觉得你够了解我了吗?
You think you know me like that?

474
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:10,485
[ 克尔奇 ] 二百万.
Two million dollars.

475
00:38:13,115 --> 00:38:15,075
[ 维雅乐 ] 你终于重新考虑了.
You're having second thoughts.

476
00:38:15,155 --> 00:38:17,625
不.
No.

477
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:19,625
你说凯撒洗了那些钱?
You said Caesar washed the money?

478
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:22,875
是啊.  然后呢? 说清楚点.
Yeah.   Then what? Exactly.

479
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:25,885
他把钱吊起来.  他什么?
He hung it up.   He what?

480
00:38:25,965 --> 00:38:27,885
把钱弄干啊.
To let it dry.

481
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:32,475
看起来象梦境一般.
It was unreal.

482
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,485
到处都是晾干的百元大钞, 好象树叶那么多.
Hundreds paper clipped everywhere like leaves.

483
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:45,485
[ 熨斗声 ]

484
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:54,495
然后他再一张一张熨直.
Then one by one he ironed all of it.

485
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:01,505
[ 熨斗声持续着 ]

486
00:39:01,595 --> 00:39:04,305
他没睡着?  没有, 连我也没睡.
Did he sleep?   No, but neither did I.

487
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:12,565
整个晚上我都被那声音烦着.
All night long I listened to that sound.

488
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:15,445
什么声音?  钱的声音.
What sound?   The sound of money.

489
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:18,365
[ 数钞票声 ]

490
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:23,075
那些钱现在在哪呢?
Where is it now?

491
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:25,835
在他办公室里.
It's in his office.

492
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,875
我今天早上见到的.
I saw it this morning.

493
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:35,005
我要去买点东西.
I need to go to the store.

494
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:41,515
钱就在他桌上的公事包里.
It's in a case on his desk.

495
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:43,685
公事包上了琐吗?
Does the case lock?

496
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:45,065
嗯.
Yes.

497
00:39:46,185 --> 00:39:50,865
噢. 告诉我关于强尼的事.  强尼?
Huh. Tell me about Johnnie.   Johnnie?

498
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,905
我觉得他跟凯撒不太喜欢对方.
Sounds like he and Caesar don't like each other.

499
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:54,905
当然了, 他们简直是痛恨对方.
Like each other? They hate each other.

500
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:56,785
为什么?  我怎么知道.
Why?   I don't know.

501
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:58,955
那是在我还没来之前就发生的事.
Happened long before I came around.

502
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:02,665
不过我想应该是凯撒觉得强尼是个傻瓜...
I think it's basically Caesar thinks Johnnie's a complete idiot...

503
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:05,335
要换成你是凯撒, 又能怎样?
but, you know, what can you do?

504
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:08,045
那个傻瓜掌管着芝加哥, 吉诺可是他老爸啊.
Johnnie runs Chicago 'cause Gino's his father.

505
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,215
谁是吉诺?
Who's Gino?

506
00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:12,635
吉诺 麻钟尼.
Gino Marzzone.

507
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:18,145
麻钟尼, 你是指安吉罗麻钟尼, 麻钟尼家族的首领?
Marzzone, as in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?

508
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:20,235
是啊, 那是他哥哥.
Yeah, that's his brother.

509
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:23,815
天呐.
Shit.

510
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:27,495
吉诺麻钟尼 今晚会到你的地方来拿钱?
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place tonight to pick up the money?

511
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:29,245
是啊.
Yeah.

512
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:31,875
而那个强尼麻钟尼是他儿子? 就是那个强尼?
And Johnnie Marzzone's his son? That's Johnnie?

513
00:40:31,955 --> 00:40:33,375
是啊.
Yeah.

514
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,255
我的老天爷.
Sweet Jesus.

515
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:46,515
太完美了.
It's perfect.

516
00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:49,435
吉诺麻尔钟今晚到你的地方去. 这很重要.
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place tonight. This is a big deal.

517
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:52,525
凯撒会很小心翼翼的应付他. 他是怕吉诺的.
Caesar's gonna want to do it right. He won't want to look like an idiot.

518
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:55,155
吉诺曾经去过你那吗?  有, 两次.
Has Gino been to your place before?   Yeah, twice.

519
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:58,195
当时怎样?  凯撒紧张的要死.
What happened?   Caesar was really nervous.

520
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:00,445
他不停的在清理房间.
He kept cleaning the apartment.

521
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:03,745
他第一次帮我挑选裙子来穿就是那时.
The first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.

522
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:05,745
强尼对你有意思吗?
Did Johnnie ever hit on you?

523
00:41:05,835 --> 00:41:09,165
他经常抛媚眼给我. 只要是女人他都有兴趣.
Johnnie hits on me all the time. He hits on anything in high heels.

524
00:41:09,255 --> 00:41:13,335
凯撒知不知道?  他经常在凯撒面前那样做.
Did Caesar ever see this?   He does it right in front of him.

525
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:16,095
事情越来越有趣了. 接着说.
This is getting better and better. Go on.

526
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:20,185
嗯, 吉诺不太会说英文, 但是也有可能在装蒜...
Well, Gino doesn't speak much English, or at least he pretends not to...

527
00:41:20,265 --> 00:41:22,475
所以他常常一见面就开门见山.
so he usually gets right to the point.

528
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:25,315
那两次他们都只聊了五分钟左右.
Both times they only talked for about five minutes.

529
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:27,565
喝了些酒就离开了.
They had a drink and then they left.

530
00:41:27,645 --> 00:41:29,775
吉诺喝了些什么?  思考兹.
What did Gino drink?   Scotch.

531
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:34,495
葛莱恩李维特. 我记的那么清楚因为凯撒对那这酒很紧张.
Glenlivet. I remember that 'cause Caesar made a big deal about it.

532
00:41:37,165 --> 00:41:38,995
嗯 好.
All right.

533
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:48,005
我有了个可行的好主意.
I have an idea how to make this work.

534
00:41:49,555 --> 00:41:52,345
[ 克尔奇 ] 回去准备准备. 慢慢来, 做的逼真点.
Go back and get ready. Take your time. Make it real.

535
00:41:53,475 --> 00:41:56,015
他们大概几点会到?
What time did you say they'd be there?

536
00:41:56,055 --> 00:42:00,025
[ 维雅乐 ] 飞机 7:00 到, 所以应该是 8:00.
The plane gets in at 7:00, so I'd say around 8:00.

537
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:02,445
[ 哈欠声 ]  [ 克尔奇 ] 好吧.
All right.

538
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:04,945
凯撒应该会在某些睡醒.
Now, at some point, Caesar's gonna quit.

539
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:09,365
大概 6:00 左右吧, 让他慢慢准备.
I guess sometime around 6:00, making sure he's got time to get ready.

540
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:14,085
当他准备好后, 你就开始骗他喝酒.
As soon as he's done, you'll be there to put a big drink in his hand.

541
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,125
[ 凯撒 ] 雪丽做出了真让人难以置信的事.
Unbelievable what this guy Shelly did.

542
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,795
我告诉你哦, 雪丽真是个聪明的混蛋.
I'll tell you, Shelly's one smart ass motherfucker.

543
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:24,055
噢, 曾经是个聪明的王八蛋.
I mean, he was one smart ass motherfucker.

544
00:42:24,095 --> 00:42:27,225
可怜的家伙. 辛辛苦苦工作了这么久.
Poor boy. Has to work so hard.

545
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:32,395
[ 呻吟 ]

546
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:35,195
[ 克尔奇 ] 你要让他放松, 忘了紧张.
You want him to relax, unwind.

547
00:42:36,615 --> 00:42:38,735
你看起来真可爱.
You look good enough to eat.

548
00:42:39,945 --> 00:42:41,745
[ 维雅乐 ] 你到时候会在哪儿?
Where will you be?

549
00:42:41,785 --> 00:42:44,075
[ 克尔奇 ] 我就在隔壁房等着.
I'll be waiting in the apartment next door.

550
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:47,455
[ 维雅乐 ] 等什么?  [ 克尔奇 ] 洗澡.
Waiting for what?   For the shower.

551
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:49,455
那就是我们的暗号.
That's gonna be our signal.

552
00:42:50,415 --> 00:42:53,335
当他洗完澡后, 你就去吧台那边.
When he's done with his shower, you'll go to the bar.

553
00:42:54,795 --> 00:42:57,345
拿那瓶吉诺喝的思考兹.
You'll get out the scotch that Gino drinks.

554
00:42:57,425 --> 00:43:00,645
那瓶酒会不小心的从你手里滑掉.
As you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.

555
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:03,265
一个意外.
An accident.

556
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:07,695
[ 凯撒 ] 维, 什么声音?
Vi, what the hell was that?

557
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,405
维, 听见了没?
Vi, you can't hear me?

558
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:12,485
啊, 惨了!  凯撒, 它滑掉.
Ah, fuck!   Caesar, it slipped.

559
00:43:12,575 --> 00:43:15,615
我打算准备一下.  你他妈怎么搞得?
I was trying to get ready.   How the fuck did you do that?

560
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:18,165
凯撒, 这是个意外, 我不小心的.
Caesar, it was an accident. I didn't mean to.

561
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:20,955
我再去买.  没时间了!
I'll get some more.   There's no fuckin' time!

562
00:43:21,045 --> 00:43:23,045
别傻了. 大把时间呢.
Don't be silly. There's lots of time.

563
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,925
我会清理, 然后再你还没换好衣服前回来.
I'll clean this up and I'll be back before you're even dressed.

564
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:27,595
妈的, 维!
Fuck, Vi!

565
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:36,815
当你开门时, 我会在那等你.
When you open the door, I'll be there.

566
00:43:41,605 --> 00:43:43,365
[ 维雅乐 ] 如果他看见你怎么办?
What if he sees you?

567
00:43:43,445 --> 00:43:45,115
[ 克尔奇 ] 他不会的.
He won't.

568
00:43:45,195 --> 00:43:48,115
你怎么就能那么确定?
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.

569
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:52,625
相信我吧.  我只是担心啊. 万一, 怎么办?
Trust me.   I'm just asking. What if?

570
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:55,165
如果他看到了...
If he does...

571
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,925
那我也没别的选择了, 对吧?
then I won't have a choice, will I?

572
00:44:02,385 --> 00:44:04,725
当我进去时, 我会去拿钱.
When I'm inside, I'll get the money.

573
00:44:46,855 --> 00:44:49,405
我需要一点东西来填满那公事包.
I'm gonna need something to fill the case.

574
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:51,445
把它藏在桌子附近.
Hide it near the desk.

575
00:44:52,485 --> 00:44:53,865
然后...
And at that point...

576
00:44:56,785 --> 00:44:58,745
就没得回头了.
there's no turning back.

577
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:12,595
当我拿到酒时...
When I get the scotch...

578
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:15,765
我怎么知道你会不会就那样溜了?
how do I know you won't just take off?

579
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:20,235
我也不知道你会不会去拿酒.
The same way I'll know that you went to go get the scotch.

580
00:45:20,315 --> 00:45:21,355
互相信任.
Trust.

581
00:45:21,445 --> 00:45:23,615
我还是不了解我怎么能不被怀疑...
I still don't see how I'm gonna get away clean...

582
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:25,615
钱是在我的房里啊.
with all the money in the apartment.

583
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:27,905
大家都会以为钱是我拿了.
Everyone's gonna think I took it.

584
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:29,325
凯撒不会.  为什么?
Not Caesar.   Why?

585
00:45:29,405 --> 00:45:31,625
因为你要骗他.
'Cause of what you're gonna tell him.

586
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:33,745
要尽量骗的逼真点.
You gotta be as real as you can.

587
00:45:34,585 --> 00:45:37,505
当你拿着酒走回去后...
The moment you walk through that door with the scotch...

588
00:45:37,545 --> 00:45:38,965
你会当他们来过了.
you'll be covered.

589
00:45:40,175 --> 00:45:43,425
那时刻是整个计划最重要的一缳.
That moment's the most important moment of the plan.

590
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:47,145
假如你演的够逼真的话, 他会相信的, 因为他内心...
'Cause if you're real enough, he's gonna believe you, 'cause deep down...

591
00:45:47,185 --> 00:45:48,435
也是那么认为的.
he'll want to.

592
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:51,775
凯? 啊, 真对不起. 他们来早了.
C? Shit, I'm sorry. They were early.

593
00:45:52,855 --> 00:45:55,945
你说什么?  他们刚走啊, 不是吗?
What are you talkin' about?   They just left, didn't they?

594
00:45:56,025 --> 00:45:58,945
什么东西, 你醉啦?  你是说他们还没来?
What, are you drunk?   They weren't just up here?

595
00:45:59,035 --> 00:46:01,445
没啊, 他们还在路上吧.
No, they're still on their way.

596
00:46:01,535 --> 00:46:03,165
那不对啊.
That doesn't make any sense.

597
00:46:04,785 --> 00:46:07,995
为什么?  我刚在楼下见到强尼.
Why?   I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

598
00:46:10,755 --> 00:46:11,835
什么?
What?

599
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:15,425
是啊. 我下车时看见他在他的宝马里.
Yeah. I was getting out of my car, and I saw him in his BMW.

600
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:19,935
不对, 那不可能.  是他, 凯撒.
Nah, it couldn't have been.   It was him, Caesar.

601
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:21,345
我很肯定.
I'm positive.

602
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:24,775
维, 那是不可能的.
Vi, that's impossible.

603
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:27,775
凯撒, 我认得强尼.
Caesar, I know Johnnie.

604
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,355
那个是他.
It was him.

605
00:46:29,445 --> 00:46:32,155
我也吓了一跳. 真不敢相信我错过了他们.
I screamed when I saw him. I couldn't believe I missed him.

606
00:46:32,235 --> 00:46:35,495
我知道你会难过, 所以我想跟他们道歉...
I knew you were gonna be upset, so I thought I'd stop and apologize...

607
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:37,745
然后把酒给吉诺, 可是...
and give Gino the scotch, but...

608
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:41,045
我鸣了几次车笛, 可是他都好象没听见. 也没停车.
I honked a couple of times, and Johnnie didn't even hear me. He didn't stop.

609
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:45,505
可是...
But...

610
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:48,885
吉诺的飞机还有半小时才到啊.
Gino's plane doesn't get here for another half hour.

611
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:55,305
呃, 实际上我也没见到吉诺在车里.
Actually, I didn't see Gino in the car.

612
00:47:06,945 --> 00:47:10,875
如果凯撒真的那么讨厌强尼, 那当他打开公事包时...
If Caesar hates Johnnie as much as you say, when he opens that case...

613
00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:14,585
他将会相信是强尼嫁祸给他.
he's gonna know in his gut that Johnnie just fucked him.

614
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:18,505
他将会进退两难. 两个人他都惹不起.
He'll have no choice. He can't go after Gino or Johnnie.

615
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,595
他只有一个退路.
There's only one way out.

616
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:22,845
就是逃跑.
He'll have to run.

617
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:26,595
他若真的逃...
And if he runs...

618
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,395
每个人都会觉得是他拿了那些钱.
everyone will assume he took the money.

619
00:47:29,475 --> 00:47:32,395
你不会有嫌疑, 而我们都会变的富有.
You'll be clean, and we'll be rich.

620
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:34,855
[ 维雅乐 ] 天啊, 太完美了.
Jesus, that's beautiful.

621
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:40,195
你真是非常聪明, 那你怎么会被抓呢?
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?

622
00:47:41,115 --> 00:47:43,325
我曾经有个伙伴.
I had a partner once.

623
00:47:43,415 --> 00:47:44,955
她出卖了我.
She fucked me.

624
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:48,835
我不会.
I won't.

625
00:47:51,965 --> 00:47:53,795
拭目以待吧.
I think we're gonna find out.

626
00:47:58,385 --> 00:48:00,515
哦, 天啊!  凯撒?
Oh, God!   Caesar?

627
00:48:02,975 --> 00:48:04,895
不.
No.

628
00:48:05,645 --> 00:48:07,565
[ 维雅乐 ] 凯?
C?

629
00:48:09,235 --> 00:48:10,485
哦, 不.
Oh, no.

630
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:13,495
哦, 老天.
Oh, God.

631
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:17,575
[ 咒骂声 ]

632
00:48:17,665 --> 00:48:20,035
维.
Vi.

633
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:21,795
维, 我被人算计了.
Vi, I've been set up.

634
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,375
强尼?
Johnnie?

635
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:24,965
那杂种!
That fuck!

636
00:48:25,755 --> 00:48:28,215
那死杂种!
That rat fuck!

637
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,095
那狗娘养的死杂种!
That motherless rat fuck!

638
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:34,595
为什么? 强尼为什么要这么做?
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?

639
00:48:38,525 --> 00:48:42,195
我的天啊. 维雅乐, 想想清楚.
Jesus Christ. Violet, open your fucking eyes.

640
00:48:42,275 --> 00:48:44,525
强尼讨厌我正如我讨厌他那样.
Johnnie hates me as much as I hate him.

641
00:48:46,075 --> 00:48:48,035
我痛恨那狗娘养的死杂种.
I hate that motherless rat fuck.

642
00:48:48,075 --> 00:48:51,205
真他妈的恨他.  可是你知道是他干的啊.
I fuckin' hate him.   But you know he did it.

643
00:48:52,075 --> 00:48:55,045
是啊. 可是? 我能怎样?
Yeah. So what? So fucking what?

644
00:48:56,375 --> 00:49:00,045
你看, 钱没了, 对吗?
Look, the money is gone, right?

645
00:49:00,085 --> 00:49:01,885
吉诺马上就要来拿了.
Gino's coming to get it.

646
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:05,225
你觉得他会相信我跟他说的...
Do you think Gino is going to believe me when I tell him...

647
00:49:05,305 --> 00:49:08,265
他的小兔崽子偷了他的钱吗?
his little rat fuck son stole it?

648
00:49:08,305 --> 00:49:11,105
换成是我也不会相信. 知道我在想什么吗?
'Cause I don't. You know what I think?

649
00:49:11,185 --> 00:49:13,895
我马上就是个死人了. 跟死没两样了.
I'm a dead man. I'm one in the back of the head.

650
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:15,525
我只能这么想啊.
That's what I think.

651
00:49:17,445 --> 00:49:18,865
那我们该怎么办?
What are we gonna do?

652
00:49:19,945 --> 00:49:22,865
我知道强尼要我落跑.
I know what Johnnie wants me to do. Johnnie wants me to run.

653
00:49:22,955 --> 00:49:24,875
他要我离开这里.
He wants me outta here.

654
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:27,915
可是假如我跑的话, 每个人都会认为是我干的...
But if I run, then everybody thinks I fucking did it...

655
00:49:27,995 --> 00:49:30,005
然后那二百万他就袋的安稳了.
and he gets away with two million clean.

656
00:49:31,965 --> 00:49:34,175
我可以想象现在的他...
I can see him right now...

657
00:49:34,255 --> 00:49:36,305
在迎接吉诺的路上, 暗笑着我的下场.
on the way to get Gino, laughin' at me!

658
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:38,265
暗笑着我, 暗笑着我!
Laughin' at me, laughin' at me !

659
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:40,015
暗笑着我!
Laughin' at me!

660
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,105
他妈的暗笑着我的下场!
Fuckin' laughin' at me!

661
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:47,275
走开! 维雅乐, 让我冷静一下, 好吗?
Don't! Please. Don't touch me, okay?

662
00:49:47,355 --> 00:49:50,065
我要好好想想. 把整件事想清楚!
I gotta think. I gotta fuckin' think this through!

663
00:49:51,695 --> 00:49:54,115
凯撒, 我觉得我们应该赶紧离开.
Caesar, I think we should run.

664
00:49:54,155 --> 00:49:56,915
现在就走吧, 免得来不及了!
We have to go now, before it's too late!

665
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:59,455
让开, 维雅乐, 让我冷静一下.
Please, Violet, leave me alone.

666
00:49:59,495 --> 00:50:00,995
好吗?
Please, all right?

667
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:03,255
你他妈的让我一个人想一想!
Just leave me the fuck alone!

668
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,305
好吧, 凯撒.
All right, Caesar.

669
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,345
我要好好的想一想. 想个办法应付.
I gotta think, that's all. I just gotta think.

670
00:50:35,505 --> 00:50:38,425
[ 电话铃声 ]

671
00:50:38,505 --> 00:50:40,505
是我.  怎么了?
It's me.   What happened?

672
00:50:40,545 --> 00:50:44,015
他疯了. 我从没见过他象现在这样.
He totally freaked out. I've never seen him like this.

673
00:50:44,055 --> 00:50:45,845
他完全疯掉了.
He's out of his fucking mind.

674
00:50:45,885 --> 00:50:48,765
不要紧的, 只要他相信是强尼干的就行了.
That's all right, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.

675
00:50:48,855 --> 00:50:51,435
相信? 天啊!
Believes it? Jesus!

676
00:50:51,525 --> 00:50:54,525
他就是因为这点发疯的. 他恨不得杀了他.
It's driving him crazy. He wants to kill him.

677
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:57,695
我不知道该怎么做, 克尔奇.
I don't know, Corky.

678
00:50:57,775 --> 00:51:01,365
我现在很紧张. 不晓得他会做出什么事情来.
I'm getting really nervous. I don't know what he's gonna do.

679
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:04,325
不要紧的维雅乐. 计划很顺利.
It's all right, Violet. It's working.

680
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:07,085
现在我们只能等着看他怎么做.
All we gotta do is wait him out and see what he does.

681
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:09,165
万一他不逃怎么办?
What if he doesn't run?

682
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:12,835
那表示他会去杀强尼.
That means he'll probably kill Johnnie.

683
00:51:12,925 --> 00:51:14,885
哦, 天呐! 我得赶紧离开!
Oh, Christ! I have to get out of here!

684
00:51:14,965 --> 00:51:19,765
听好, 假如他不走, 你可以走.
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you gotta do is break down.

685
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:22,305
进去睡房假装收拾东西.
Go into the bedroom and pack some things.

686
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:25,315
一面哭一面对他说你爱他, 可是你不能再忍受了.
Start crying. Tell him you love him, but you can't take it.

687
00:51:25,395 --> 00:51:29,025
你现在很怕, 所以你要离开, 然后就走出去.
You're sorry, but you gotta Ieave, and just waIk out.

688
00:51:29,105 --> 00:51:31,195
好吧.
All right. Okay.

689
00:51:31,275 --> 00:51:34,325
计划就快成功了, 撑着点.
We're almost there. Just hang on.

690
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:35,535
他来了!
He's coming!

691
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:41,415
我知道我该怎么做了. 我要把钱拿回来.
I know what I have to do. I have to get the money back.

692
00:51:41,455 --> 00:51:44,295
钱? 不见了啊.
The money? The money's gone.

693
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:47,715
不, 不, 不, 强尼拿了. 我要去拿回来.
No, Johnnie's got it. I gotta get it back.

694
00:51:48,635 --> 00:51:50,055
怎么找, 你不知道他收那去了.
It could be anywhere.

695
00:51:50,135 --> 00:51:52,135
他不够时间的维雅乐.
There's not enough time, Violet.

696
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:54,305
他要去机场接吉诺对吧?
Johnnie's gotta pick up Gino at the airport, right?

697
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:58,395
[ 凯撒 ] 那说明钱现在还在他的车子里.
That means he's probably got the money with him in the car.

698
00:51:58,475 --> 00:51:59,935
他没有看见你对吧?
Did he see you?

699
00:51:59,985 --> 00:52:02,525
没有.
No.

700
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:04,985
好. 那很好.
Good. That's good.

701
00:52:09,075 --> 00:52:11,245
那说明我现在有利了.
That means I got the edge.

702
00:52:11,325 --> 00:52:13,285
他不知道我晓得了.
He doesn't know I know.

703
00:52:16,755 --> 00:52:18,835
所以他把报纸放进公事包里去.
That's why he put the paper in the case.

704
00:52:20,295 --> 00:52:22,305
他要我亲手交给吉诺.
He wants me to hand it to Gino.

705
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:26,185
假如我真那么做
Then there's no doubt I did it.

706
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,565
吉诺就会杀了我.
Gino will put a bullet in me himself.

707
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:34,145
可是那不会发生了.
But that's not gonna happen.

708
00:52:37,985 --> 00:52:41,155
那白痴算计不了我的. 这种程度的计划难不倒我.
That jack off's not gonna set me up. No way. Not like this.

709
00:52:42,865 --> 00:52:44,245
你疯了.
This is insane.

710
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,925
你要干嘛?
What are you doin'?

711
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,505
我要离开.
I'm leaving.

712
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:57,135
我不想搅进这趟浑水. 太可怕了.
I don't want any part of this shit. I don't want to be involved.

713
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,475
你不能走.  为什么不行.
You can't leave.   The hell I can't.

714
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:05,025
我需要你.  你根本不需要我.
I need you.   You don't need me.

715
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:07,025
你从来没需要过我.
You've never needed me.

716
00:53:07,065 --> 00:53:09,195
我帮不了你啊, 明白吗?
I can't help you, understand?

717
00:53:17,955 --> 00:53:19,955
我不能让你离开.
I can't let you leave.

718
00:53:21,085 --> 00:53:24,585
假如你不跟我在一起, 我只有认定你也要跟我作对.
If you're not with me, I have to assume you're against me.

719
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:28,005
凯撒, 你真疯了.
Caesar, this is crazy.

720
00:53:28,095 --> 00:53:31,265
也许吧, 也许没有.
Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't.

721
00:53:32,635 --> 00:53:35,055
你也许不小心掉了那瓶酒.
Maybe you dropped that bottle of scotch by accident.

722
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:36,395
你也许是故意的.
Maybe you didn't.

723
00:53:37,435 --> 00:53:40,485
你能够那么容易的...
I would've been so easy...

724
00:53:40,565 --> 00:53:42,605
让他能溜进屋来.
to let him in as you left.

725
00:53:44,195 --> 00:53:45,735
你怎么会那么想的.
You can't believe that.

726
00:53:45,785 --> 00:53:47,905
我见过他色迷迷的望过你.
I've seen the way he looks at you.

727
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,825
他一直想要得到你.
He's always wanted you.

728
00:53:51,915 --> 00:53:53,795
也许二百万让你昏了头.
Maybe two million bucks finally bought you.

729
00:54:03,635 --> 00:54:05,095
对不起, 维雅乐.
I'm sorry, Violet.

730
00:54:09,305 --> 00:54:10,725
我是想信你.
I wanna trust you.

731
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,395
可是你得明白.
But you understand.

732
00:54:21,655 --> 00:54:23,615
我没有其他的选择.
I don't have any other choice.

733
00:54:42,355 --> 00:54:44,105
你确定你不想喝点东西?
You sure you don't want a drink?

734
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:52,945
[ 弹动声 ]

735
00:55:05,295 --> 00:55:07,505
[ 门铃声 ]

736
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,805
你好.  是啊, 我们终于到了.
Hello.   Yeah, we're here.

737
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:13,805
啊, 强尼.  开门啊.
Hey, Johnnie.   Open the fuckin' door.

738
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,305
好的. 上来吧.
Sure. Come on up.

739
00:55:52,645 --> 00:55:53,895
吉诺.
Gino.

740
00:55:56,405 --> 00:55:59,285
见到你真好. 维, 看看谁来了.
Good to see you. Vi, look who's here.

741
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:01,325
你好, 吉诺. 好久不见.
Hello, Gino. How are you?

742
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:03,825
嗨, 维雅乐.

743
00:56:08,955 --> 00:56:11,715
你不该打我的.  你是不是还想继续.
You shouldn't have hit me.   You wanna get into this now?

744
00:56:11,795 --> 00:56:13,385
不了, 凯撒, 现在不行.
No, Caesar, not now.

745
00:56:14,635 --> 00:56:16,595
[ 笑声 ]

746
00:56:22,605 --> 00:56:25,065
你永远都是那么迷人维雅乐.
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.

747
00:56:40,585 --> 00:56:43,415
吉诺, 葛莱恩李维特, 是吗?
Gino, Glenlivet, right?

748
00:56:43,505 --> 00:56:44,625
[ 意大利文 ]

749
00:56:44,675 --> 00:56:47,595
我要跟维雅乐一样的饮料.
And I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.

750
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:50,345
我没喝东西.  哦, 那么, 我也不用了.
I'm not drinking.   Oh, well, then neither will I.

751
00:56:52,185 --> 00:56:54,395
噢 不 我要 T&T.
No, I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic.

752
00:56:55,855 --> 00:56:57,855
凯撒, 两杯 T&T's.
Caesar, two T&T's.

753
00:57:16,585 --> 00:57:20,505
干杯? 来, 大家.
Salud, eh? Roy, Pop, Violet.

754
00:57:20,545 --> 00:57:21,885
凯撒.
Caesar.

755
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:25,935
哦, 不行, 强尼.
Uh uh, no, no, Johnnie.

756
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,355
我要下注.  现在不准打电话.
I gotta make a bet.   No goddamn phone. Not now.

757
00:57:30,225 --> 00:57:33,315
凯撒, 来这坐. 我们好好聊聊.
Cesare, come and sit. We're gonna talk now.

758
00:57:33,395 --> 00:57:36,315
强尼, 你也是. 不是那边.
Johnnie, you too. No, no.

759
00:57:39,825 --> 00:57:41,245
凯撒, 看着我.
Cesare, look at me.

760
00:57:43,115 --> 00:57:45,205
强尼告诉了我事情的经过.
Johnnie, he said to me what happened.

761
00:57:47,245 --> 00:57:51,965
凯撒, 帮我个忙好吗? 私人要求, 行吗?
Cesare, you gotta do me a favor. A personal favor for me, huh?

762
00:57:53,045 --> 00:57:56,425
我想你应该开始象尊重我般尊重强尼, 好吗?
You gotta start respecting Johnnie the way you respect me.

763
00:57:58,595 --> 00:58:01,555
[ 意大利文 ] 好, 好.
Good, good.

764
00:58:03,015 --> 00:58:06,435
还有你强尼, 别再乱来.
And you, Johnnie, you gotta stop acting stupid.

765
00:58:07,945 --> 00:58:10,365
你要凯撒尊重你就得用心的做事.
You gotta earn this respect that Cesare's gonna give.

where's my money?

We know how this was done?

是的. 知道了.
Yeah. I know.

这种事不会再发生了?
And it won't happen again?

好. 搞定. 走吧.
Good. Done. We go now.

哦, 等等啊 老爸.
Wait a minute, Pop. Jesus Christ.

放轻松吧. 来多一杯.
Just relax. Have a drink.

Caesare, Glenlivet

那, 凯撒, 告诉我
So, Caesar, tell me something.

781
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,650
总数是多少.
What did it total out at?

782
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,240
2.176. 2.176.\n2.176.

783
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:16,540
[ 口哨声 ] 难以置信.
Unbelievable.

784
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:19,000
你能相信吗, 维雅乐?
Can you believe that, Violet?

Johnnie.

786

我只想知道一件事.
I just wanna know one thing.

787
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,380
就一件事.
Just one thing after he made such a big deal about it.

788
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,760
应该无所谓吧, 凯撒?
I'll bet it wasn't such a big deal, huh, Caesar?

789
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,600
什么事呢, 强尼?
What's that, Johnnie?

790
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,270
钱啊.
The money.

791
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,320
我觉得把那些钱弄干净...
I'll bet it wasn't nothin' to make it clean...

792
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,700
也没多大难题.
after you made such a big fuckin' deal about it.

793
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,780
我跟你说过什么  这对我很重要, 爸.
What I tell you     It's important to me, Pop.

794
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:46,980
这个简单的问题, 他答了, 就没事了.
It's a simple question. If he'd answer it, that's the end of it.

795
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,280
你想说什么, 强尼?
Where's this goin', Johnnie?

796
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:57,210
承认吧.
Just admit it.

你还需要钥匙吗?
You don't need a key.

那我要怎么打开它?
Then how the fuck can I open it?

814

你刚刚怎么开现在就怎么开.
The same way you did before.

815
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:10,640
你在胡说些什么?

831
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:18,050
我的天! 这是怎么一回事.
For Christ's sake! This isn't happening.

832
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:22,810
下一枪就打断你的命根子.
Next one blows off your fuckin' dick!

[ 扳动声 ]

851
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,160
我是被逼的, 维雅乐.
I had to do it, Violet.

852
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,500
你看见了, 我没别的选择.

是强尼敢的.
It was Johnnie.

856
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:38,850
笨蛋东西! 你以为你能陷害我? 是吗?
You stupid fuck! You think you could set me up? Huh?

857
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,860
我是个死人吗强尼? 我是死人?
I'm a dead man, Johnnie? I'm a fucking dead man?

858
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,700
猜猜看强尼. 谁死了啊? 谁啊?
Guess again, Johnnie. Who's the dead man? Who?

谁死了, 杂种? 谁? 谁?
Who's dead, fuckface? Who? Who?

860
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:56,120
我听不见强尼, 再猜啊.
I can't hear you, Johnnie. Guess again.

861
01:04:56,210 --> 01:05:00,090
再猜多一次强尼, 再猜啊!
Take another guess, Johnnie. Take another fuckin' guess.

862

你要干嘛?
What are you doing?

也许三个小时吧.
Maybe three hours.

凯撒, 你想干嘛?
Caesar, what are you going to do?

865
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:33,090
你觉得呢? 我们当然是把钱给拿回来了.  什么?
We're gonna get the money back.   What?

866
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:37,300
维雅乐, 如果把钱拿回来后, 这一切都好必没发生过.
Violet, if we get the money back, then none of this ever happened.

867
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:41,430
凯撒, 你刚杀了吉诺麻钟尼.
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.

868
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,430
错, 我没有. 没尸体的话我就没杀人了.
No, I didn't. Not if the bodies disappear.

869
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:48,270
假如钱在这. 可他们没出现.
Not if the money's here. Then they never showed up.

What happened to them?

871
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:53,940
我不知道. 也许我们永远不知道.
I don't know. Maybe we'll never know.

872
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,280
天哦, 还真是幸运.
My guess, it was a job.

873
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:05,420
也许是卡佩拉吧. 全是生意的一部分.
Maybe the Carpella's. All part of the business.

874
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,050
一旦我们找到钱后, 什么事情都没有了.
Look, once we find the money, then everything's gonna be all right.

凯撒, 我们该怎么办?
Caesar, what are we gonna do?

881
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:33,660
只是警察吧了. 尽量拖延时间.
They're just cops. Stall 'em as long as you can.

01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:19,870
好, 我是强尼的话.
Okay, I'm Johnnie.

950
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,130
我一走进来.
I come in.

951
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:29,460
我会放那呢?
Where did I put it?

952
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:35,100
这是一笔大数目, 我要把它收好.
That's a Iot of fuckin' money, and I gotta hide it.

953
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,440
我要把它藏起来, 我没多少时间.
I gotta hide it. I don't have much time.

954
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,810
我要去机场接我老爸!
I gotta get to the airport, pick up my fuckin' daddy!

955
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,810
[ 玻璃被敲破声 ]

956
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:52,940
我恨不得看看凯撒着急的脸.
I can't wait to see Caesar's face when he finds out.

957
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:06,630
他会放那呢?  凯.
Where did he put it?   C.

958
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,300
想啊, 想啊.
Think. Think.

959
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,530
在那里, 你他妈的?
Where is it, you motherfucker?

960
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:25,530
在那里? 在那里?
Where? Where?

961
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,540
[ 抽泣 ]

962
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,350
凯?
C?

963
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:49,350
凯.
C.

964
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,780
不在这, 凯撒.
It's not here, Caesar.

965
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,790
会在那里?
Where is it?

966
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,080
不知道. 怎么知道他会把它藏到那里去了.
I don't know. It could be anywhere.

967
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,870
我们也不知道他是不是单身一个人.
We don't even know if he was alone, Caesar.

968
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,960
来吧. 我们该离开了.
Come on. We have to get out of here.

969
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,130
我们没多少时间了.
We don't have much time.

970
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,270
你要干什么?
What are you doing?

971
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,460
要弄多些时间. 多点时间.
Gotta buy more time. More time.

972
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:44,000
你要打给谁呢?
Who are you gonna call?

973
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:55,350
喂?  啊, 米奇.
Yeah?   Hey, Mickey.

974
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:56,850
哦天.
Oh, God.

975
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,440
凯撒, 你他妈知道现在几点了吗?
Caesar, what the fuck time is it?

976
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,610
哦, 米奇对不起吵醒了你. 我知道现在很晚了.
Oh, Mickey, did I wake you up? Listen, I'm sorry. I know it's late.

977
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:07,950
可是他们人还没来, 我有点担心.
I don't know if this is a big deal, but they ain't showed up yet.

978
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,000
什么? 他们还没来?
What? They ain't there?

979
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,080
嗯. 我打电话去机场问过了. 飞机没误点.
No. I I I called the airport. The plane landed on time.

980
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:17,590
我也打给了强尼, 可是那里没人听.
I even called over at Johnnie's house, but there was no answer there.

981
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:20,800
好, 那我帮你打听打听. 看看我能帮上忙吗.
Okay. Let me call around. I'll see what I can do.

982
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,850
别乱走, 留在家.
Don't go anywhere, okay?

983
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:24,970
好的. 我会的.
Yeah, okay, sure.

984
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,980
凯撒, 钱还安全吧?
Caesar, you still have the money?

985
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:30,020
当然了米奇, 钱在我这儿.
Oh, yeah, Mickey, I still got the money.

986
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,780
正在看着它们呢.
Starin' right at it.

987
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:35,660
好. 等等吧, 我会再打给你的.
Good. Sit tight. I'll call you.

988
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,730
晚安.
Bye.

989
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,840
那我开始收拾东西, 你知道该怎么做的了.
So I'll start packing. You know what you have to do.

990
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,510
我会用强尼的车把尸体丢进河里去.
I'll use Johnnie's car to dump the bodies in the lake.

991
01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:00,260
我需要垃圾袋, 绳子跟胶带.
I need plastic bags, rope and tape.

992
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:03,770
快点.
Just hurry.

993
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:18,870
克尔奇, 听电话.
Please, Corky, please.

994
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,260
谢谢老天.  我还在这里.
Thank God.   I'm still here.

995
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,760
我真怕你会离我而去.
I was so afraid you were going to leave me.

996
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,310
你没出卖我, 我也不会出卖你的.
You don't quit on me, Violet. I won't quit on you.

997
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,820
克尔奇, 成功了. 他好象要开始逃了.
Corky, it worked. He's going to run.

998
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,820
他需要一些时间来处理那些尸体...
He needs to take care of the bodies to buy himseIf a little time...

999
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:47,330
但当他离开后, 这一切都结束了.
but as soon as he leaves, it's over.

1000
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:49,450
再等多一阵子.
Just a little while longer.

1001
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,620
克尔奇...
Corky...

1002
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,920
我要告诉你一些东西.
I want to tell you something.

1003
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,930
我知道, 维雅乐.
I know, Violet.

1004
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,140
我知道.
I know.

1005
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,680
那是我留下来的原因.
It's why I'm still here.

1006
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:30,830
那是谁?
Who was that?

1007
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,210
维, 那是谁?
Vi, who the fuck was that?

1008
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:38,800
你打了给米奇? 你是不是打了给米奇?
Did you call Mickey? Did you call Mickey?

1009
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:40,850
是不是!
Did you!

1010
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:03,670
米奇, 是你吗?
Mickey, is that you?

1011
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:04,750
妈的.
Fuck.

1012
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,850
[ 电话铃声 ]

1013
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:27,620
[ 电话铃声持续着 ]

1014
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,540
那是谁? 谁在隔壁?
Who is that? Who's over there?

1015
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,870
谁在隔壁? 告诉我! 告诉我!
Who's over there? Tell me! Tell me!

1016
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:40,170
不要! 住手! 凯撒! 凯撒!
No! Stop! Caesar! Caesar!

1017
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,800
[ 维雅乐 惨叫 ]

1018
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,220
不! 不! 不要! 凯撒!
No! No! No! Caesar!

1019
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:56,650
[ 惨叫 ]

1020
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,830
把枪放下否则我开枪.
Drop the fucking gun or die.

1021
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,750
放下!
Drop it!

1022
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,210
转过身来.
Turn around.

1023
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,220
你?
You?

1024
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:53,180
他妈的, 活见鬼.
Holy fucking Christ.

1025
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,980
你是在他妈的跟我开玩笑吧.
You gotta be fucking kiddin' me.

1026
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,940
[ 凯撒 ] 你是在他妈的跟我开玩笑吧.
You gotta be fucking kiddin' me.

1027
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,570
喂!
Hey!

1028
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,490
起来!
Come on!

1029
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:17,160
起来. 起来.
Wake up. Wake up.

1030
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,010
起来, 你这贱人.
Wake up, you fucking dyke.

1031
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:28,090
好.
Good.

1032
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:31,060
我现在知道一切了.
I know everything now.

1033
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:34,690
我不想听什么"我不知道"的废话, 明白吗?
So I don't wanna hear any "I don't know" bullshit, understand?

1034
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:41,400
靠, 我第一眼见到你时就该知道会有这么一天.
God, I shouId've seen this coming the minute I met you.

1035
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,120
大家都知道你是那种不能被信任的人.
Everybody knows your kind can't be trusted.

1036
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,410
烂货, 看到你我就反感.
Fuckin' queers. You make me sick.

1037
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,840
你犯了个致命的错误.
But you made a fatal mistake.

1038
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,340
就是算计错人了...
You tried to fuck the wrong guy...

1039
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:01,060
我可以跟你打包票...
and I swear to you...

1040
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,230
我一定会杀了你.
I'm gonna kill you for it.

1041
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:06,100
我的钱呢?
Where's my money?

1042
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,980
别告诉他. 他不会杀你的.
Don't tell him. He can't kill you.

1043
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:12,280
维雅乐.  暂时不会, 拿到钱后就难说了.
Violet.   Not until he has the money.

1044
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:22,250
钱在哪儿?
Now, where is it?

1045
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,920
舔我.
Lick me.

1046
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,840
我 的 钱 在 那 里 ?
Where is my money?

1047
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:33,140
杀了我, 要不就把枪拿开.
Either pull the trigger, or get that fucking thing out of my face.

1048
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,180
臭婊子.
Fuckin' cunt.

1049
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,930
凯撒, 冷静用脑想想.
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think.

1050
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:40,520
维雅乐, 别告诉我怎么做.
Violet, don't try to tell me what to do.

1051
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,890
你和我们一样需要那笔钱.
You need the money just like we do.

1052
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:45,440
闭嘴!  放我们走. 万事好商量.
Shut up!   Let us go. We'll make a deal.

1053
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,780
你他妈的闭嘴!
Shut the fuck up!

1054
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,950
你把她给怎么了, 啊?
What did you do to her, huh?

1055
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:54,700
你他妈的把她给怎么了, 啊?
What did you fuckin' do to her?

1056
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:56,870
这个不是我的维雅乐!
That's not my Violet!

1057
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:00,790
她对你做了些什么?
What did she do to you?

1058
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,670
很多你办不到的事情.
Everything you couldn't.

1059
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,850
你这不知感恩的婊子.
You ungrateful fuckin' bitch.

1060
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:16,270
没遇见我之前你可是一无所有的.
Vi, you were nothing before you met me.

1061
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,480
难道你忘了? 你什么都没有.
Don't you remember? You had nothing.

1062
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:22,570
谁给了你这个地方住, 啊?
Who gave you this place, huh?

1063
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:24,620
谁给你的?
Who gave it to you?

1064
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,290
是我啊, 是我!
I did, Vi. I did.

1065
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:30,830
你什么也不是, 什么也没有.
You were nothing. You had nothing.

1066
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:34,960
那么多废话. 看看你自己吧, 凯撒.
What a load of crap. Take a look at yourself, Caesar.

1067
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:38,590
你也不过是个小混混. 替黑帮洗黑钱.
You're nothing but a common thug. You launder money for the Mob.

1068
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,010
租女人就象租这房子一样.
You rent women like you rented this apartment.

1069
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:45,310
你利用了我, 正如我利用了你一样.
You used me, Caesar. That's all. Just like I used you.

1070
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,020
全部的生意.
All part of the business.

1071
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,570
你出卖了我.
You betrayed me.

1072
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:52,360
你杀了吉诺.
You murdered Gino.

1073
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:55,530
当然了, 你害的我那样做的. 我是被逼的.
Yeah, sure. You made me. I had to do that.

1074
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:58,080
放屁! 你自己干的.
Bullshit! You did it.

1075
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,920
你不甘心被强尼陷害所以你杀了他们.
You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.

1076
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,420
闭嘴.  你闭嘴.
Shut up.   You shut up.

1077
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,870
好吧, 维雅乐. 好吧!
All right, Violet. All right!

1078
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:07,870
你要那些钱? 全部的钱?
You want the business, Violet? All of the business?

1079
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,250
我会给你的. 我会全部给你.
I'll fucking give it to you. I'll give you all of it.

1080
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,720
我会让你痛苦的.
I'm gonna make you fuckin' suffer.

1081
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,010
就好象雪丽一样. 就好象他妈的雪丽一样.
Just like Shelly, Violet. Just like fuckin' Shelly.

1082
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:25,110
对不起, 克尔奇.
I'm sorry, Corky.

1083
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:28,820
别说傻话. 来帮我.
Don't be sorry. Help me.

1084
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,580
哦, 不, 不, 不, 不!
Oh, no, no, no!

1085
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:42,800
[ 嘀咕声 ]

1086
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,380
嗯 维, 记得这个吗?
Hey, Vi, do you remember these?

1087
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,600
好, 我将由维雅乐开始.
All right, I'm gonna start with Violet.

1088
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,270
[ 呻吟 ]

1089
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:56,940
好让你知道是怎么一回事.
So you get an idea of what's comin'.

1090
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:05,330
我会问你十个问题.
I'm gonna ask you ten questions.

1091
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:10,290
每当我得不到答案时...
Every time I don't get an answer...

1092
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,630
我会剪掉她一支手指.
I cut off a finger.

1093
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,640
[ 呻吟持续着 ]

1094
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,560
钱在那里?
Where's the money?

1095
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,440
[ 门铃响 ]

1096
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:39,610
是米奇.
It's Mickey.

1097
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:47,580
我刚问说:"钱在那里?"
I said, "Where's the money?"

1098
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:50,250
[ 维雅乐 呻吟 ]  好吧, 我告诉你.
All right, I'll tell you.

1099
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:53,840
在隔壁房子里.
It's in the apartment next door.

1100
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,010
我把它放进油漆桶里.
I put it in the paint drums.

1101
01:26:56,090 --> 01:27:00,890
好. 现在, 我说过我会杀了你的, 记得吗?
Good. Now, I promised you I wouId kill you. Remember?

1102
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,270
你不可以杀我.
You can't kill me.

1103
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:05,730
哦? 为什么?
Oh, really? Why not?

1104
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,440
我可能在说谎.
I could be lying.

1105
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,160
你会后悔你那么说的.
You're gonna be sorry you said that.

1106
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:26,340
[ 电梯声响 ]

1107
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,220
他娘的!
Motherfucker!

1108
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:36,150
狗娘养的.
Son of a bitch.

1109
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,410
钥匙, 钥匙, 钥匙, 钥匙.
Keys, keys, keys, keys.

1110
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,380
[ 呻吟 ]

1111
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:30,500
[ 敲门声 ]

1112
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:35,590
你要的话, 我可以现在马上杀了你,
I can kill you right now, if that's what you want.

1113
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,310
还是你选择继续生存.
Or you can live.

1114
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:40,640
那你就得帮我.
But I need your help.

1115
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:44,400
你得帮我让米奇相信一切事情都正常.
You gotta help me make Mickey believe that everything is normal.

1116
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,320
现在, 你想怎么办?
Now, what do you wanna do?

1117
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,110
想生存吗?
Do you wanna live?

1118
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,140
[ 开琐声 ]

1119
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:24,830
哦! 天啊!
Oh! Oh, shit!

1120
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:29,500
真是的! 米奇, 你吓死我了.
Christ! Mickey, you scared the shit out of me.

1121
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:34,000
你们怎么了? 怎么都拿着枪啊?
What are you guys doin' with your peckers in your hand?

1122
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,000
你要杀我吗米奇?
You gonna do me, Mickey?

1123
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,130
不是, 刚刚没人应门, 我担心你有事.
No. There was no answer.

1124
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,800
难怪我好象听到有人敲门.
I thought I heard some knocking at the door.

1125
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,800
我按了电铃, 敲了门...
I was buzzing, I was knocking...

1126
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,390
不过我想你在浴室里听不见吧.
but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.

1127
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:49,560
是啊米奇, 我太紧张了.
Yeah, well, you know, Mick, I'm all wound up.

1128
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,110
我为了吉诺的事几乎疯掉, 所以...
I'm driving myself crazy over this Gino thing, and, well...

1129
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:56,650
维, 她想说...
Vi, you know, she thought maybe...

1130
01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:01,200
让我在浴室里放松放松
she could, you know, relax me in the

1131
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:06,540
维雅乐是个好女人.
That Violet is one nice lady.

1132
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:10,250
我也希望有人能让我放轻松.
I wish someone would help me relax.

1133
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:15,090
呵呵, 喝点什么?
Uh, let me get you guys a drink, huh?

1134
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:18,140
我要思考兹, 你呢?
I got scotch, whatever you want.

1135
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:23,060
我们很担心你呢, 凯.
We was worried about you.

1136
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,770
我? 为什么?
Me? Why?

1137
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,490
我们去了强尼家, 想查查看.
We went over to Johnnie's place, just to check it out.

1138
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,280
没想到那里被人破坏的很利害.
It was busted up, bad.

1139
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:31,160
什么?
What?

1140
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,700
所以我在想可能是以为那笔钱而来的.
Started thinking maybe it's about the money.

1141
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:37,420
我打了电话给你, 可是一直不通.
So I call you, but all I got is the busy signal.

1142
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,420
我想说可能是电话掉了, 就赶紧飞奔来了.
I figure the phone is off the hook. That's why I come rushing over here.

1143
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,880
哦, 那电话. 真是的, 是我弄的,
Fuck, the phone. Shit. That was me. I did that.

1144
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:47,470
妈的! 不应该那样做的, 对不起.
Fuck! That was a stupid thing to do, huh?

1145
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:52,190
没事, 假如维雅乐是在帮我放松...
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax...

1146
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:54,150
我也会做同样的事.
I'd probably do the same thing.

1147
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:19,800
噢 凯, 我有件事想问你.
Hey, Caes, can I ask you something?

1148
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,840
说吧.
Sure.

1149
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:25,390
你怎么把家具都重新排列过了呢?
Why did you move all the furniture around?

1150
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:31,600
让我猜猜.
Let me guess.

1151
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:35,070
那应该也是维雅乐的意思.
That was Violet's idea too.

1152
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,700
是的, 呃, 其实...
Yeah, uh, actually...

1153
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:43,540
她对于吉诺的到来很紧张...
she was nervous about Gino comin'...

1154
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:45,660
想说一切都要尽善尽美
and wanted everything to look perfect and

1155
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,670
你知道女人的啦, 米奇.
You know women, Mick.

1156
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:52,220
当然啦 凯, 她们会令男人干蠢事, 对吧?
Sure, Caes. They make us do stupid things, don't they?

1157
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:01,390
那就是钱吗?  是的, 就是那个.
Is that the money?   Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1158
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,060
总数是多少啊?
What did it total out at?

1159
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,190
2.176. 2.176\n2.176.

1160
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,240
雪丽那王八蛋.
That fuckin' Shelly.

1161
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:10,530
想说交给那帮家伙就没事了, 谁知道...
Gotta hand it to the guy, but, Jesus...

1162
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,410
如果我是他我会在很早以前就逃了.
if I were him, I would've bailed a long time ago.

1163
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:18,040
一个人用的着那么多钱吗?
I mean, how much money does a man need?

1164
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:24,380
我还记得当时我在看这这笔钱.
I remember, I was just staring at all this goddamn money.

1165
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:27,800
雪丽是跪着的...
Shelly went down on his knees...

1166
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:31,630
强尼突然朝他头开了一枪.
and the next thing I know, Johnnie just blows his head off.

1167
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:35,760
搞的满地一蹋糊涂.
What a fuckin' mess.

1168
01:32:35,810 --> 01:32:37,770
强尼还在不停的笑...
Johnnie's laughing his ass off...

1169
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:41,270
凯撒就是在那时控制不住自己的.
and that's when Caesar lost it.

1170
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:42,820
完了"乓"的一声.
And boom.

1171
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,320
凯撒打了他.
He cold cocked him.

1172
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,530
他打了那王八强尼麻钟尼.
He cold cocks fuckin' Johnnie Marzzone.

1173
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:53,370
[ 笑声 ]

1174
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:56,790
喂, 凯撒.
Hey, Caesar.

1175
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:01,800
钥匙呢?
Where's the key?

1176
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,140
呃, 钥匙
Um, the key

1177
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,600
哦, 在我裤子里, 放在浴室了.
Oh, they're in my pants in the bathroom.

1178
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:14,900
哦, 去他的. 我用不着钥匙.
Ah, fuck it. I don't need the key.

1179
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:19,620
我不用钥匙都能进来, 不是吗?
I didn't need a key to get in here, did I?

1180
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:22,370
[ 吞口水状 ]

1181
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,480
[ 电话响 ]

1182
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:44,440
那会是谁呢?  [ 电话铃声持续 ]
Who the hell could that be?

1183
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,570
你不接听吗?
Are you gonna answer it?

1184
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,160
要的.
Yeah.

1185
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:02,710
喂?  [ 维雅乐 ] 嗨, 凯撒.
Hello?   Hello, Caesar.

1186
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:04,830
这是吉诺.  啥?
This is Gino.   What?

1187
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:08,340
你在自寻死路, 笨蛋. 假装我是吉诺.
You're blowing your only chance, asshole. Act like I'm Gino.

1188
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:12,840
感谢老天! 我们都在担心你啊, 吉诺.
Holy Christ! We've been worried sick about you, Gino.

1189
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:14,350
好孩子.  是吉诺.
Good boy.   It's Gino.

1190
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:16,600
他们在那里?  我们遇到了一起车祸.
Where the hell is he?   We were in a car accident.

1191
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,270
他们遇到了车祸.  幸好大家都没事.
They were in a car accident.   But everybody's all right.

1192
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:22,400
大家都没事, 只是撞伤了而已.
Everybody's all right. Just bruises and shit.

1193
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,440
真他妈的难以置信. 那些高速公路巡逻人员都死那去了.
Un fucking believabIe. I called those highway patrols. Dumb fucks.

1194
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:27,450
米奇, 拜托别吵我听不是很清楚.
Mick, please. I'm trying to hear Gino.

1195
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:30,700
听我说, 混蛋. 我知道你的枪现在在吧台那里.
Now you listen to me, asshole. I know your gun is behind the bar.

1196
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:33,870
我们现在来个交易, 否则我就叫米奇来.
Either we make a deal right now, or I hand this phone to Mickey.

1197
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,370
我在听.
I'm listening.

1198
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,920
好. 我要属于我的东西. 那一半的钱.
All right. I want what's mine. I want half the money.

1199
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:42,970
我们把米奇干掉, 可是不准杀克尔奇.
We get rid of Mickey, and no one else dies.

1200
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:46,260
明白了吗? 说,"我是的, 我明白了."
No one. Say, "Yes, I understand."

1201
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:48,310
是的, 我明白了.
Yes, I understand.

1202
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:51,650
告诉他们我在肯尼迪附近的圣.玛丽那里.
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy in the waiting room.

1203
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:54,320
拿着电话直到我走出来为止.
Stay on the phone until I come out.

1204
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,360
好的, 是.
Okay. Right.

1205
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:59,620
肯尼迪附近的圣.玛丽那里.
St. Mary's off the Kennedy.

1206
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,280
是的.
Yeah.

1207
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,950
强尼没事吧?
Johnnie's okay?

1208
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,460
米奇? 你怎么会在这里?
Mickey? What are you doing here?

1209
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:08,290
维雅乐, 吉诺与强尼遇到了车祸.
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident.

1210
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,380
哦老天! 大家没事吧?
Oh, my God! Is everybody all right?

1211
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,630
我想没事的.  好, 拜拜.
I think everything's okay.   All right. Bye.

1212
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,840
他们在圣.玛丽那里, 真难以置信.
They're at St. Mary's. Can you fucking believe this?

1213
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:17,100
我的车子坐不了那么多人, 给我你的车匙.
I can't fit them all in my car, so give me your keys.

1214
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,640
当然.  你驾我的车吧.
Sure.   You drive my car.

1215
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,980
维! 维!
Vi! Vi!

1216
