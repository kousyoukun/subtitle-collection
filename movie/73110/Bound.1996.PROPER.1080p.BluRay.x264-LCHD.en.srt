1
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:11,374
I had this image of you
inside of me...

2
00:01:11,447 --> 00:01:13,355
like a part of me.

3
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,428
You planned this whole thing.

4
00:01:20,504 --> 00:01:23,121
We make our own choice.
We pay our own prices.

5
00:01:23,192 --> 00:01:25,395
Five years is a long time.

6
00:01:25,464 --> 00:01:27,350
Where's the fuckin' money?

7
00:01:34,169 --> 00:01:36,077
All part of the business.

8
00:01:36,153 --> 00:01:38,672
All part of the business.

9
00:01:38,745 --> 00:01:40,653
You made a choice once.

10
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,702
What choice?

11
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,022
I want out.

12
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:03,407
Like a part of me.

13
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:07,154
Hold the elevator.

14
00:02:10,875 --> 00:02:12,335
Thanks.

15
00:03:08,063 --> 00:03:10,233
Yeah, I looked over everything, sir.

16
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:12,212
I don't think there should be
any problems.

17
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:16,478
Yes, sir, I ordered the vanity
and I looked at the tub.

18
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:19,096
I'm pretty sure we can rout it out.

19
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:25,077
Yeah, I'll start everything
first thing tomorrow.

20
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,397
Thanks again for this opportunity,
Mr. Bianchini.

21
00:03:35,809 --> 00:03:37,662
Yeah.

22
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:02,272
Hi.

23
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:05,088
My name is Violet.
We sort of met on the elevator.

24
00:04:06,275 --> 00:04:07,484
I'm Corky.

25
00:04:09,476 --> 00:04:11,809
I heard you working in here,
and I was wondering...

26
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,947
if you'd like a cup of coffee.

27
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,283
Sure.

28
00:04:16,356 --> 00:04:17,729
Come on in.

29
00:04:17,796 --> 00:04:19,583
Just give me a second.

30
00:04:19,652 --> 00:04:20,992
All right.

31
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,672
What happened to Rajiv?

32
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:32,668
He went home to India or someplace,
but I think he'll be back.

33
00:04:32,742 --> 00:04:35,610
So this is just
a temporary situation for you?

34
00:04:35,685 --> 00:04:38,553
Yeah, pretty much.
One day at a time.

35
00:04:39,942 --> 00:04:42,624
I guessed you're a straight black.

36
00:04:42,694 --> 00:04:44,034
Good guess.

37
00:04:44,102 --> 00:04:45,115
Thanks.

38
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:46,596
My pleasure.

39
00:04:47,846 --> 00:04:51,642
To be honest, I did have
a slightly ulterior motive.

40
00:04:51,719 --> 00:04:54,435
I was wondering if I might
ask you a little favor.

41
00:04:54,503 --> 00:04:56,444
- Favor.
- Yeah.

42
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:58,974
I'm kind of a night person,
and I was wondering...

43
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:03,237
if you might wait a little bit
before you start using the power tools.

44
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,855
- Oh, sorry.
- Oh, no. No.

45
00:05:05,927 --> 00:05:10,715
It's not your fault. It's just
the walls here are so terribly thin.

46
00:05:11,752 --> 00:05:14,817
- Really.
- It's like you're in the same room.

47
00:05:14,888 --> 00:05:17,058
If it's too much trouble,
I understand.

48
00:05:17,129 --> 00:05:19,943
It's no trouble at all.
I got a lot to do here.

49
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:23,485
You doin' all the work yourself?

50
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:25,250
That is so amazing.

51
00:05:25,322 --> 00:05:29,477
I am so in awe of people
who can fix things.

52
00:05:29,546 --> 00:05:33,768
My dad was like that.
We never had anything new.

53
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:36,549
Whenever anything was broken,
he would just...

54
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:40,195
open it up, tinker with it
a little bit...

55
00:05:40,266 --> 00:05:41,726
and fix it.

56
00:05:41,802 --> 00:05:43,972
His hands were magic.

57
00:05:46,346 --> 00:05:48,516
I'll bet your car
is 20 years old.

58
00:05:48,587 --> 00:05:49,993
Truck.

59
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:51,912
Truck. Of course.

60
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:55,145
- '63 Chevy.
- I knew it.

61
00:05:59,756 --> 00:06:03,268
Well, I guess I should be going.

62
00:06:03,339 --> 00:06:05,672
You can drop the cup off
at any time.

63
00:06:08,172 --> 00:06:09,381
Thanks.

64
00:06:11,308 --> 00:06:12,583
My pleasure.

65
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:25,989
Well, well.

66
00:06:26,062 --> 00:06:27,915
It's been a long time, Cork.

67
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:31,243
Five years, two months
and sixteen days.

68
00:06:32,045 --> 00:06:34,597
- How you doin', Sue?
- Like shit.

69
00:06:34,669 --> 00:06:37,385
Now that we're all caught up,
can I buy you a drink?

70
00:06:37,454 --> 00:06:38,663
Thanks.

71
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:42,792
- *  Friends keep tellin' me *
- Welcome home.

72
00:06:42,862 --> 00:06:45,228
*  That you ain't no good *

73
00:06:45,295 --> 00:06:47,334
*  But, oh, oh, they don't know *

74
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,315
Did you get a job yet?

75
00:06:49,391 --> 00:06:52,739
Yeah. Some plumbing,
painting and shit.

76
00:06:53,776 --> 00:06:56,841
I mean a J-O-B.
A real job.

77
00:06:59,088 --> 00:07:00,941
No. Not for me, Sue.

78
00:07:01,903 --> 00:07:04,269
I'm just here to get laid.

79
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:07,820
*  I ain't never gonna *

80
00:07:07,888 --> 00:07:09,577
*  Love a man *

81
00:07:09,648 --> 00:07:11,469
*  The way that I *

82
00:07:11,537 --> 00:07:13,423
*  I love you *

83
00:07:16,689 --> 00:07:20,714
*  Some time ago I thought *

84
00:07:20,786 --> 00:07:24,778
*  You had run out of fools *

85
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,791
*  But I was so wrong *

86
00:07:29,746 --> 00:07:31,949
- Hi.
- Hello.

87
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:36,205
Hey, Jesse,
what's happenin' here?

88
00:07:38,354 --> 00:07:40,327
Wait. I know you.

89
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,280
I don't think so.

90
00:07:43,347 --> 00:07:45,320
I didn't know you were out.

91
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:50,799
When you get tired
of Cagney and Lacey, find me.

92
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:53,517
*  Don't you never never say
that we're through *

93
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:32,401
*  Fast and slow
Night and day *

94
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:34,411
*  When you stop to think *

95
00:08:34,486 --> 00:08:37,202
*  It just gets in the way *

96
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:40,336
*  And there's not a single soul
among us *

97
00:08:45,143 --> 00:08:46,800
Yeah.

98
00:08:46,872 --> 00:08:48,278
Hey, Mr. Bianchini.

99
00:08:49,144 --> 00:08:50,604
Everything's going just fine.

100
00:08:51,736 --> 00:08:53,939
Yeah, I got the tub drain
all cleaned out.

101
00:08:56,952 --> 00:08:58,325
What apartment?

102
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,268
Oh, no.

103
00:09:09,336 --> 00:09:12,433
Shit! I didn't know
he would call you.

104
00:09:13,337 --> 00:09:15,245
You must think
I'm a total nuisance.

105
00:09:15,322 --> 00:09:16,782
Not exactly.

106
00:09:16,857 --> 00:09:19,027
I'm sorry. I would
usually call Rajiv...

107
00:09:19,098 --> 00:09:21,846
but I didn't know what to do,
so I called Mr. Bianchini.

108
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:25,678
- He said you lost something?
- Yeah.

109
00:09:26,555 --> 00:09:27,731
Come on in.

110
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:37,940
I was doing the dishes, and just as I
pulled the stopper, my earring fell in.

111
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:41,392
That's why I got upset.
It's one of my favorites.

112
00:09:44,155 --> 00:09:45,910
You got a pot or a bucket?

113
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:20,539
Did you find it?

114
00:10:23,903 --> 00:10:27,644
Oh, my God.
I can't believe that.

115
00:10:27,711 --> 00:10:30,972
I can't thank you enough.
You have to let me pay you something.

116
00:10:32,479 --> 00:10:34,616
- No.
- No ?

117
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:38,263
Told Bianchini I'd do it.
I did it.

118
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:41,268
If you won't take money,
how about a drink?

119
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,308
You can't work all night.

120
00:10:47,648 --> 00:10:48,857
All right.

121
00:10:52,993 --> 00:10:54,236
One drink.

122
00:10:54,305 --> 00:10:56,278
What would you like?

123
00:10:56,352 --> 00:10:57,660
Beer.

124
00:10:57,728 --> 00:10:59,068
Beer.

125
00:10:59,136 --> 00:11:00,411
Of course.

126
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:10,876
Sit down.

127
00:11:26,307 --> 00:11:27,418
Thanks.

128
00:11:27,490 --> 00:11:29,398
You seem uncomfortable.

129
00:11:30,882 --> 00:11:32,604
Do I make you nervous, Corky?

130
00:11:32,675 --> 00:11:34,200
No.

131
00:11:35,523 --> 00:11:36,699
Thirsty, maybe.

132
00:11:39,555 --> 00:11:41,114
Curious, maybe.

133
00:11:41,187 --> 00:11:45,081
That's funny. I'm feeling
a little bit curious myself.

134
00:11:47,556 --> 00:11:49,081
That's a great tattoo.

135
00:11:54,085 --> 00:11:55,938
Beautiful labris.

136
00:11:56,005 --> 00:11:58,240
Are you surprised
I know what it is?

137
00:11:58,308 --> 00:11:59,583
Maybe.

138
00:12:11,014 --> 00:12:12,442
I have a tattoo.

139
00:12:14,022 --> 00:12:16,355
Would you like to see it?

140
00:12:20,742 --> 00:12:23,261
A woman in upstate New York
did it for me.

141
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:27,805
Do you like it?

142
00:12:27,878 --> 00:12:29,949
Took her all day to do it.

143
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:34,339
She promised
it wouIdn't hurt, but...

144
00:12:35,495 --> 00:12:38,341
it was sore
for a long time after.

145
00:12:39,752 --> 00:12:41,638
I couldn't even touch it.

146
00:12:44,232 --> 00:12:46,140
Now I love
the way it feels.

147
00:12:49,992 --> 00:12:51,267
Here.

148
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:56,167
Touch it.

149
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:08,709
- What are you doing?
- Isn't it obvious?

150
00:13:10,346 --> 00:13:12,133
I'm trying to seduce you.

151
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:14,758
Why?

152
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:16,799
Because I want to.

153
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:21,410
I've wanted to ever since I saw you
that day in the elevator.

154
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,474
I know you don't believe me...

155
00:13:29,547 --> 00:13:31,455
but I can prove it to you.

156
00:13:38,796 --> 00:13:40,704
You can't believe what you'd see...

157
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:46,248
but you can believe
what you feel.

158
00:13:51,534 --> 00:13:54,981
I've been thinking about you
all day.

159
00:14:11,406 --> 00:14:13,259
You planned this whole thing.

160
00:14:14,511 --> 00:14:16,998
You dropped that earring
down the sink on purpose, didn't you?

161
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,126
If I say yes,
will you take your hand away?

162
00:14:22,415 --> 00:14:25,261
- No.
- Yes.

163
00:14:29,487 --> 00:14:31,395
Oh, please, Corky.

164
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:32,899
Oh, please.

165
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:35,949
Kiss me!

166
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:05,034
Oh, fuck!

167
00:15:08,946 --> 00:15:11,628
Violet! Vi, you home?

168
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:13,704
Yeah, I'm right here, C.

169
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:19,754
- What the fuck is this?
- I didn't--

170
00:15:19,827 --> 00:15:21,255
What the fuck is--

171
00:15:22,772 --> 00:15:25,007
Oh.

172
00:15:25,075 --> 00:15:27,343
Corky, this is Caesar.
Caesar, Corky.

173
00:15:27,411 --> 00:15:30,890
I thought--

174
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,632
It's fuckin' dark in here.

175
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:38,376
Corky's doing some work
for Mr. Bianchini.

176
00:15:39,765 --> 00:15:42,349
Oh, yeah. Right.
Don mentioned that to me.

177
00:15:43,861 --> 00:15:45,616
I'm sorry. Hi.

178
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:47,210
Welcome to the family.

179
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:51,279
So you're working
with Rajiv, right?

180
00:15:51,349 --> 00:15:53,584
No. Rajiv's in India.

181
00:15:53,653 --> 00:15:55,626
She's doing the work herself.

182
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,041
No shit.

183
00:15:57,109 --> 00:16:00,042
Bianchini hired you. You must be
pretty good with your hands.

184
00:16:00,118 --> 00:16:02,386
- He's a good friend of mine.
- That's what Violet says.

185
00:16:02,454 --> 00:16:03,794
Family really.

186
00:16:04,854 --> 00:16:07,024
- When did you get out?
- Jesus, Caesar.

187
00:16:07,095 --> 00:16:09,395
What? It ain't
no big fuckin' deal.

188
00:16:09,463 --> 00:16:11,666
I know who Don hires.

189
00:16:11,735 --> 00:16:15,509
You know, he did time himself.
Thirteen fuckin' years.

190
00:16:16,375 --> 00:16:18,196
What did you do?

191
00:16:19,031 --> 00:16:21,135
- Five.
- Five.

192
00:16:21,207 --> 00:16:23,540
That's not bad. What for?

193
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:25,907
That's none
of your goddamn business.

194
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:28,527
You're right. She's right.
It's none of my goddamn business.

195
00:16:28,599 --> 00:16:30,987
You don't have to tell me.
It's just--

196
00:16:31,063 --> 00:16:33,200
I want you to understand
one thing, all right?

197
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,893
You're amongst good people here.

198
00:16:44,025 --> 00:16:45,518
Come on, come on.

199
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:49,717
If you understand what I'm
talkin' about, you'll take the money.

200
00:16:49,786 --> 00:16:53,080
If you don't, then I'm gonna
have to worry about you.

201
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:59,632
Good. I hate to worry.

202
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:02,190
I got ulcers.

203
00:17:04,955 --> 00:17:06,677
I should be going.

204
00:17:06,746 --> 00:17:09,428
What? No, stick around.
Get her a drink.

205
00:17:09,499 --> 00:17:12,051
I gotta go clean out my brushes.

206
00:17:12,123 --> 00:17:13,496
Another time.

207
00:17:14,427 --> 00:17:16,597
Right. Another time.

208
00:17:31,772 --> 00:17:37,335
Mmm, Corky, Corky.
What are you doing?

209
00:18:00,286 --> 00:18:02,903
I had to see you.

210
00:18:02,974 --> 00:18:06,486
Look. I don't think
this is a good idea.

211
00:18:06,558 --> 00:18:08,793
I wanted to apologize.

212
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:13,369
No, please, don't apologize.

213
00:18:13,439 --> 00:18:16,569
If there's one thing I can't stand it's
woman who apologize for wanting sex.

214
00:18:22,943 --> 00:18:25,178
I'm not apologizing
for what I did.

215
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,655
I'm apologizing
for what I didn't do.

216
00:18:52,705 --> 00:18:54,613
You have a bed somewhere?

217
00:20:24,712 --> 00:20:26,336
I can see again.

218
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:46,918
I needed that.

219
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,362
So Caesar's Mafia, huh?

220
00:20:51,434 --> 00:20:53,255
You have to ask?

221
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:55,044
No.

222
00:20:55,115 --> 00:20:56,291
Funny.

223
00:20:56,362 --> 00:20:58,401
Nobody really
calls it that anymore.

224
00:20:58,474 --> 00:21:00,611
Caesar just calls it
"the business."

225
00:21:00,683 --> 00:21:02,918
How did you meet him?

226
00:21:02,987 --> 00:21:05,833
They took over a club
I was working at.

227
00:21:05,899 --> 00:21:07,686
Caesar started managing it.

228
00:21:07,756 --> 00:21:10,755
- He's a launderer?
- Basically.

229
00:21:10,828 --> 00:21:12,452
How long you been with him?

230
00:21:13,548 --> 00:21:14,976
About five years.

231
00:21:16,941 --> 00:21:19,209
Five years is a long time.

232
00:21:19,276 --> 00:21:21,129
Yes, it is.

233
00:21:22,476 --> 00:21:24,449
The redistribution of wealth.

234
00:21:25,164 --> 00:21:27,978
- Excuse me?
- Isn't it what you wanted to know?

235
00:21:28,045 --> 00:21:29,953
What I did time for?

236
00:21:30,029 --> 00:21:32,962
"The redistribution of wealth?"

237
00:21:33,037 --> 00:21:35,883
That's what I tell someone
when I'm trying to get them in my bed.

238
00:21:35,950 --> 00:21:38,666
But I'm already in your bed.

239
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:44,745
My cell mate would say
she did her time for getting caught.

240
00:21:44,814 --> 00:21:47,464
She was always
a lot more honest than me.

241
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,654
You didn't have to tell me
if you didn't want to.

242
00:21:51,726 --> 00:21:53,699
I guess I wanted to.

243
00:21:57,486 --> 00:21:59,143
I'm glad you did.

244
00:22:00,271 --> 00:22:02,092
So am I.

245
00:22:08,912 --> 00:22:12,009
*  Let me tell you
about a girl I know *

246
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,927
*  She is my baby
and she lives next door *

247
00:22:14,993 --> 00:22:18,090
*  Every mornin'
before the sun comes up *

248
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,330
*  She brings my coffee
in my favorite cup *

249
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,715
- *  That's why I know... *
- You think I don't know that?

250
00:22:23,793 --> 00:22:25,221
Please. Come on.

251
00:22:25,297 --> 00:22:27,663
Will you just--
I have to leave tonight.

252
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:30,982
Don't make me beg, Violet.

253
00:22:33,009 --> 00:22:34,917
Two minutes. Thank you.

254
00:22:46,259 --> 00:22:47,719
Hey, Violet.

255
00:22:47,794 --> 00:22:49,287
You look great.

256
00:23:02,388 --> 00:23:06,664
I had this image of you
inside of me.

257
00:23:07,988 --> 00:23:09,896
Like a part of me.

258
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:14,093
You are so beautiful.

259
00:23:17,013 --> 00:23:18,986
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

260
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:25,136
Yes, there is.
You didn't want to see me, did you?

261
00:23:25,205 --> 00:23:28,051
If there's one thing I can't stand
about sleeping with women...

262
00:23:28,117 --> 00:23:30,025
it's all the fucking mind reading.

263
00:23:31,285 --> 00:23:34,033
- I don't understand.
- I know, Violet.

264
00:23:34,101 --> 00:23:36,849
That's 'cause you can't understand.
We're different.

265
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:39,121
We're not that different, Corky.

266
00:23:39,191 --> 00:23:41,873
Ah, let's see.

267
00:23:42,903 --> 00:23:44,756
This is the part
where you tell me...

268
00:23:44,823 --> 00:23:47,091
what matters is on the inside...

269
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:50,255
and that inside of you there's
a little dyke just like me.

270
00:23:50,326 --> 00:23:54,187
No, she's nothing like you.
She's a whole lot smarter than you are.

271
00:23:54,263 --> 00:23:56,204
Is that what her daddy tells her?

272
00:23:56,279 --> 00:24:00,434
I know what I am. I don't have
to have it tattooed on my shoulder.

273
00:24:00,504 --> 00:24:04,365
- You saying you don't have sex with men?
- I don't.

274
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:10,515
For Christ's sake, I heard you.
Thin walls, remember?

275
00:24:10,584 --> 00:24:12,754
What you heard wasn't sex.

276
00:24:14,585 --> 00:24:15,958
What was it?

277
00:24:17,304 --> 00:24:18,513
Work.

278
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:24,141
You made certain choices in your life
that you paid for.

279
00:24:24,217 --> 00:24:27,761
You said you made them because
you were good at something...

280
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,620
and it was easy.

281
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:32,306
You think you're the only person
that's good at something?

282
00:24:34,170 --> 00:24:37,584
We make our own choices.
We pay our own prices.

283
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:40,178
I think we're more alike
than you care to admit.

284
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:42,453
What about that guy this morning?

285
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:44,499
Shelly?

286
00:24:44,571 --> 00:24:47,221
Don't tell me.
You're a workaholic.

287
00:24:48,442 --> 00:24:51,889
No, Shelly knows what I am.
He saw me in a bar with another woman.

288
00:24:53,819 --> 00:24:56,818
Yeah. I suppose
he just wants to watch.

289
00:24:56,892 --> 00:24:59,989
Fuck it.
I think you'd better leave.

290
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,946
Yeah, I think I'd better.

291
00:25:03,388 --> 00:25:05,776
Try not to steal anything
on the way out.

292
00:26:19,937 --> 00:26:22,718
Where the fuck is it?

293
00:26:22,785 --> 00:26:25,501
I didn't do it!
I swear to you!

294
00:26:32,003 --> 00:26:33,212
Come on!

295
00:26:33,282 --> 00:26:35,135
Where is it?

296
00:26:35,202 --> 00:26:36,761
- Oh, that hurt, didn't it?
- Ow!

297
00:26:39,491 --> 00:26:41,595
You think you're smart?

298
00:26:43,620 --> 00:26:45,506
Where's that fuckin' money?

299
00:26:45,571 --> 00:26:47,260
Please, please!

300
00:26:47,331 --> 00:26:49,818
Please, let me go!

301
00:26:49,892 --> 00:26:51,200
Please stop it!

302
00:26:53,124 --> 00:26:55,676
Don't make me beg!

303
00:26:55,748 --> 00:26:57,656
Stop it! Please!

304
00:26:59,716 --> 00:27:02,235
- Please stop!
- Tryin' to fuck us? You wanna fuck me?

305
00:27:02,309 --> 00:27:05,756
You piece of shit.
We're goin' home.

306
00:27:06,885 --> 00:27:08,793
- Nobody fucks him!
- I'm not fucking him!

307
00:27:08,869 --> 00:27:10,461
I swear to God!

308
00:27:10,533 --> 00:27:11,906
Johnnie! Ho!

309
00:27:13,478 --> 00:27:15,386
He's making too much noise.

310
00:27:15,461 --> 00:27:17,500
You hear that, bitch?
Shut up.

311
00:27:21,189 --> 00:27:22,595
Give me a towel.

312
00:27:23,461 --> 00:27:24,986
Shut up!

313
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:26,435
Here.

314
00:27:28,454 --> 00:27:29,979
Put it in his mouth.

315
00:27:43,304 --> 00:27:44,928
Caesar, I'm leaving.

316
00:27:45,991 --> 00:27:47,844
What? Why?

317
00:27:49,543 --> 00:27:51,909
- I didn't use a good towel.
- Caesar, I'm serious.

318
00:27:51,976 --> 00:27:54,146
I can't take this.
I have to get out of here.

319
00:27:54,216 --> 00:27:55,425
Why?

320
00:27:56,648 --> 00:27:58,173
'Cause you know him?

321
00:27:59,369 --> 00:28:00,742
Aw, you see?

322
00:28:01,897 --> 00:28:04,317
Baby, that's what I love about you.

323
00:28:04,393 --> 00:28:06,301
You're so fuckin' sensitive.

324
00:28:08,073 --> 00:28:10,493
But I like you here.

325
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:12,423
I want you to stay.

326
00:28:13,449 --> 00:28:15,749
This is hard on me too.

327
00:28:15,817 --> 00:28:17,277
I like Shelly.

328
00:28:18,666 --> 00:28:22,014
So why don't you watch some TV
and put on a cassette or something?

329
00:28:29,675 --> 00:28:30,950
You okay, Violet?

330
00:28:32,299 --> 00:28:34,665
Mick, why is Johnnie here?

331
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:37,315
You know how I feel
about that psycho fuck?

332
00:28:38,828 --> 00:28:40,867
Caesar, didn't I tell you
to get something?

333
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:43,360
Sure. Sorry about that.

334
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:49,032
You shouldn't have to see this.

335
00:28:49,099 --> 00:28:51,586
Why don't you get out of here?
Go for a walk.

336
00:28:52,460 --> 00:28:54,760
Caesar wants me to stay.

337
00:28:57,452 --> 00:29:00,996
Don't worry about Caesar.
I'll handle Caesar.

338
00:29:02,637 --> 00:29:04,196
Get out of here.

339
00:29:04,269 --> 00:29:06,788
- We can go all night, bitch.
- Okay.

340
00:29:06,862 --> 00:29:08,071
Thank you, Mickey.

341
00:29:10,030 --> 00:29:11,239
Here you go.

342
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:13,862
All fuckin' night, baby!
All night!

343
00:29:21,422 --> 00:29:23,690
Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay?

344
00:29:26,702 --> 00:29:28,130
Bitch!

345
00:29:30,255 --> 00:29:31,683
Pick him up.

346
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,108
Shelly,

347
00:29:43,183 --> 00:29:46,248
I'm gonna ask you ten times.
You understand?

348
00:29:47,407 --> 00:29:48,616
Ten times.

349
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:50,629
Yeah.

350
00:30:04,689 --> 00:30:06,728
One. Where's our money?

351
00:30:27,763 --> 00:30:29,355
You all right?

352
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:44,391
Come on.
Let's get out of here.

353
00:30:47,284 --> 00:30:49,771
Keep it.

354
00:31:06,870 --> 00:31:08,778
Shelly was skimming
from the business.

355
00:31:10,454 --> 00:31:14,893
He came to see me yesterday
because he was afraid Caesar found out.

356
00:31:14,966 --> 00:31:17,583
He wanted to run, but he
wanted me to come with him.

357
00:31:17,654 --> 00:31:19,791
Even though he knew about you.

358
00:31:19,863 --> 00:31:22,677
- Yeah.
- This guy's in love with you?

359
00:31:22,743 --> 00:31:26,571
That's what he tells himself,
but it's not even about me.

360
00:31:26,647 --> 00:31:30,355
He could have run at any time,
but he didn't want out.

361
00:31:30,424 --> 00:31:32,332
It sounds like
he wanted to get caught.

362
00:31:32,408 --> 00:31:34,578
Yeah. Maybe he did.

363
00:31:34,648 --> 00:31:37,549
He would brag to me
all the time.

364
00:31:37,624 --> 00:31:40,787
He was never afraid
of Caesar because...

365
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,380
he didn't know him.

366
00:31:42,456 --> 00:31:43,731
Not like I do.

367
00:31:45,432 --> 00:31:47,700
I used to be able
to block it out.

368
00:31:49,017 --> 00:31:51,088
Or I'd just tell myself that...

369
00:31:52,345 --> 00:31:54,613
I wasn't really there,
and so...

370
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:57,901
none of it really mattered.

371
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:01,623
But I can't do that anymore.

372
00:32:03,706 --> 00:32:06,520
I'm making the same mistake
Shelly made...

373
00:32:07,546 --> 00:32:10,479
but now I know what I want.

374
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,369
I want out.

375
00:32:18,906 --> 00:32:20,847
I want a new life.

376
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:26,416
I see what I've been waiting for,
but I can't do it alone.

377
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:35,450
I need your help, Corky.

378
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:43,281
- Caesar's gonna get the money--
- How much money?

379
00:32:43,356 --> 00:32:45,460
Shelly said it's over
two million dollars.

380
00:32:48,541 --> 00:32:51,442
Yeah. So Caesar's gonna get it.

381
00:32:51,517 --> 00:32:54,582
He's gonna bring it by the apartment.
He's gonna count it.

382
00:32:54,653 --> 00:32:57,467
He's gonna go through the books and try
and figure out how Shelly did it.

383
00:32:57,534 --> 00:33:00,216
Wait a minute. Violet, do you know
what you're saying?

384
00:33:00,285 --> 00:33:02,739
You're asking me
to help you fuck over the Mob.

385
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,069
Violet, these people are serious.

386
00:33:06,142 --> 00:33:08,759
You wanna know how serious?
Ask your friend Shelly.

387
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:12,407
They're worse than any cop because they
have lots of money and no rules.

388
00:33:12,478 --> 00:33:14,419
You fuck them,
you better do it right.

389
00:33:14,494 --> 00:33:17,427
That's why I need your help.
You said you were good.

390
00:33:17,503 --> 00:33:18,909
I am good.

391
00:33:21,856 --> 00:33:25,564
Let's just say for a moment
I believe everything you're saying.

392
00:33:25,632 --> 00:33:28,020
- You think I'm lying?
- I didn't say that.

393
00:33:29,472 --> 00:33:32,340
But since you did,
let's say you are.

394
00:33:32,417 --> 00:33:34,904
It would have been easy for you
to set up Shelly.

395
00:33:34,977 --> 00:33:36,569
You could have had him killed...

396
00:33:36,641 --> 00:33:38,712
knowing that Caesar would bring
the money back to the apartment.

397
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:43,352
All you would need to keep yourself
clean is someone unconnected.

398
00:33:44,608 --> 00:33:46,101
Someone like me.

399
00:33:47,841 --> 00:33:49,847
Is that what you think?

400
00:33:49,921 --> 00:33:51,829
I'm just making a point.

401
00:33:54,434 --> 00:33:56,505
You have no idea
what you're asking...

402
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,504
how much trust it takes two people
to do something like this.

403
00:34:04,674 --> 00:34:07,040
For me, stealing has always been
a lot like sex.

404
00:34:08,226 --> 00:34:10,614
Two people who want
the same thing.

405
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,110
They get in a room,
they talk about it.

406
00:34:14,403 --> 00:34:16,638
They start to plan.
It's like flirting.

407
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:20,664
It's kind of like foreplay.

408
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:23,934
Because the more they talk about it,
the wetter they get.

409
00:34:27,268 --> 00:34:29,755
The only difference is,
I can fuck someone I've just met.

410
00:34:31,525 --> 00:34:35,037
But to steal, I need to know someone
like I know myself.

411
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:38,585
You think you know me like that?

412
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:42,168
I wanna see the money.

413
00:34:45,188 --> 00:34:46,681
Oh, my God!

414
00:34:46,757 --> 00:34:48,698
Don't worry.
It ain't mine.

415
00:34:57,062 --> 00:34:59,581
- Caesar, what happened?
- It was unbelievable, Vi.

416
00:34:59,654 --> 00:35:01,627
Un-fuckin'-believable!

417
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,572
Shit! Look at this shirt.

418
00:35:04,647 --> 00:35:06,588
Look at it.
It's ruined.

419
00:35:06,663 --> 00:35:09,117
It all started when Shelly
took us to the money.

420
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,872
I'll tell you something.
Mickey, he knows his shit.

421
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,851
He does.
Shelly took us right there.

422
00:35:13,927 --> 00:35:16,446
So Shelly's down
on his knees, right...

423
00:35:16,519 --> 00:35:19,747
and he's pulling out this money
from a safe on the floor...

424
00:35:19,815 --> 00:35:21,275
and I'm standin' there...

425
00:35:21,352 --> 00:35:23,358
and I'm lookin' at it, right?

426
00:35:23,431 --> 00:35:25,535
Like, "Holy fuck!"

427
00:35:25,608 --> 00:35:30,844
All I can think about is, "How the fuck
was he able to do this," when bang!

428
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,886
Johnny caps him.
He caps Shelly!

429
00:35:33,961 --> 00:35:36,993
Blood goes flyin' everywhere.
All over me. All over the money.

430
00:35:37,064 --> 00:35:40,096
I have no idea
if this is even all of it.

431
00:35:42,057 --> 00:35:45,252
And right then,
I go through the roof and bam!

432
00:35:45,321 --> 00:35:47,174
I punch the dumb son of a bitch.

433
00:35:47,241 --> 00:35:49,607
I punch him right in
his dumb fuckin' face.

434
00:35:49,673 --> 00:35:51,581
I didn't give a shit
whose son he was.

435
00:35:51,658 --> 00:35:55,748
I just wanted to hit him again-- smack
some sense into the dumb son of a bitch!

436
00:35:55,819 --> 00:35:58,818
Look at the shit that
I gotta fuckin' deal with now!

437
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:01,890
- What are you gonna do with it?
- I told him to run it through the cycle.

438
00:36:01,963 --> 00:36:04,962
But no, Johnnie calls up the old man,
and I guess he's got other plans...

439
00:36:05,035 --> 00:36:07,849
because he wants to pick up
this shit tomorrow night.

440
00:36:12,363 --> 00:36:14,150
Where's the laundry detergent?

441
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,127
It's in the linen cabinet.

442
00:36:35,182 --> 00:36:38,050
Come to my place
in the morning, early.

443
00:36:40,301 --> 00:36:42,918
You think you know me like that?

444
00:36:45,997 --> 00:36:47,686
Two million dollars.

445
00:36:50,190 --> 00:36:52,098
You're having second thoughts.

446
00:36:52,174 --> 00:36:54,507
No.

447
00:36:54,574 --> 00:36:56,427
You said Caesar washed the money?

448
00:36:56,495 --> 00:36:59,560
- Yeah.
- Then what? Exactly.

449
00:36:59,631 --> 00:37:02,445
- He hung it up.
- He what?

450
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:04,364
To let it dry.

451
00:37:07,374 --> 00:37:08,747
It was unreal.

452
00:37:16,431 --> 00:37:19,332
Hundreds paper-clipped everywhere
like leaves.

453
00:37:26,609 --> 00:37:29,870
Then one by one
he ironed all of it.

454
00:37:36,688 --> 00:37:39,305
- Did he sleep?
- No, but neither did I.

455
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:47,211
All night long
I listened to that sound.

456
00:37:47,282 --> 00:37:49,964
- What sound?
- The sound of money.

457
00:37:55,986 --> 00:37:57,294
Where is it now?

458
00:37:58,323 --> 00:37:59,915
It's in his office.

459
00:37:59,987 --> 00:38:01,895
I saw it this morning.

460
00:38:06,802 --> 00:38:08,710
I need to go to the store.

461
00:38:12,659 --> 00:38:14,959
It's in a case on his desk.

462
00:38:15,028 --> 00:38:17,034
Does the case lock?

463
00:38:17,107 --> 00:38:18,382
Yes.

464
00:38:19,444 --> 00:38:23,916
- Huh. Tell me about Johnnie.
- Johnnie?

465
00:38:23,988 --> 00:38:25,896
Sounds like he and Caesar
don't like each other.

466
00:38:25,973 --> 00:38:27,826
Like each other?
They hate each other.

467
00:38:27,893 --> 00:38:29,615
- Why?
- I don't know.

468
00:38:29,685 --> 00:38:31,691
Happened long before
I came around.

469
00:38:31,765 --> 00:38:35,244
I think it's basically Caesar
thinks Johnnie's a complete idiot...

470
00:38:35,317 --> 00:38:37,804
but, you know,
what can you do?

471
00:38:37,877 --> 00:38:40,396
Johnnie runs Chicago
'cause Gino's his father.

472
00:38:40,469 --> 00:38:41,547
Who's Gino?

473
00:38:43,349 --> 00:38:44,809
Gino Marzzone.

474
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:50,091
Marzzone, as in Angelo Marzzone,
head of the Marzzone family?

475
00:38:50,166 --> 00:38:52,107
Yeah, that's his brother.

476
00:38:54,135 --> 00:38:55,541
Shit.

477
00:38:56,599 --> 00:38:59,053
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight to pick up the money?

478
00:38:59,127 --> 00:39:00,751
Yeah.

479
00:39:00,823 --> 00:39:03,243
And Johnnie Marzzone's his son?
That's Johnnie?

480
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,693
Yeah.

481
00:39:07,351 --> 00:39:09,390
Sweet Jesus.

482
00:39:15,896 --> 00:39:17,302
It's perfect.

483
00:39:17,368 --> 00:39:20,084
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place
tonight. This is a big deal.

484
00:39:20,153 --> 00:39:23,054
Caesar's gonna want to do it right.
He won't want to look like an idiot.

485
00:39:23,129 --> 00:39:25,583
- Has Gino been to your place before?
- Yeah, twice.

486
00:39:25,657 --> 00:39:28,503
- What happened?
- Caesar was really nervous.

487
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:30,673
He kept cleaning the apartment.

488
00:39:30,745 --> 00:39:33,810
The first time he picked out the dress
he wanted me to wear.

489
00:39:33,881 --> 00:39:35,734
Did Johnnie ever hit on you?

490
00:39:35,801 --> 00:39:39,029
Johnnie hits on me all the time.
He hits on anything in high heels.

491
00:39:39,098 --> 00:39:43,025
- Did Caesar ever see this?
- He does it right in front of him.

492
00:39:43,098 --> 00:39:45,650
This is getting better and better.
Go on.

493
00:39:45,722 --> 00:39:49,583
Well, Gino doesn't speak much English,
or at least he pretends not to...

494
00:39:49,659 --> 00:39:51,763
so he usually gets
right to the point.

495
00:39:51,835 --> 00:39:54,517
Both times they only talked
for about five minutes.

496
00:39:54,587 --> 00:39:56,658
They had a drink
and then they left.

497
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:58,770
- What did Gino drink?
- Scotch.

498
00:39:58,843 --> 00:40:03,282
Glenlivet. I remember that 'cause
Caesar made a big deal about it.

499
00:40:05,851 --> 00:40:07,606
All right.

500
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,241
I have an idea
how to make this work.

501
00:40:17,757 --> 00:40:20,439
Go back and get ready.
Take your time. Make it real.

502
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:23,921
What time did you say
they'd be there?

503
00:40:23,997 --> 00:40:27,771
The plane gets in at 7:00,
so I'd say around 8:00.

504
00:40:27,837 --> 00:40:30,105
All right.

505
00:40:30,174 --> 00:40:32,507
Now, at some point,
Caesar's gonna quit.

506
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:36,727
I guess sometime around 6:00,
making sure he's got time to get ready.

507
00:40:36,797 --> 00:40:41,269
As soon as he's done, you'll be there
to put a big drink in his hand.

508
00:40:41,342 --> 00:40:44,188
Unbelievable
what this guy Shelly did.

509
00:40:44,254 --> 00:40:46,741
I'll tell you, Shelly's
one smart-ass motherfucker.

510
00:40:46,815 --> 00:40:50,807
I mean, he was
one smart-ass motherfucker.

511
00:40:50,879 --> 00:40:53,845
Poor boy.
Has to work so hard.

512
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:01,497
You want him to relax, unwind.

513
00:41:02,879 --> 00:41:04,885
You look good enough to eat.

514
00:41:06,079 --> 00:41:07,768
Where will you be?

515
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:10,043
I'll be waiting
in the apartment next door.

516
00:41:10,112 --> 00:41:13,242
- Waiting for what?
- For the shower.

517
00:41:13,312 --> 00:41:15,165
That's gonna be our signal.

518
00:41:16,096 --> 00:41:18,910
When he's done with his shower,
you'll go to the bar.

519
00:41:20,289 --> 00:41:22,743
You'll get out the scotch
that Gino drinks.

520
00:41:22,817 --> 00:41:25,914
As you do, the bottle
will slip from your hands.

521
00:41:27,138 --> 00:41:28,413
An accident.

522
00:41:30,594 --> 00:41:32,665
Vi, what the hell was that?

523
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,263
Vi, you can't hear me?

524
00:41:35,330 --> 00:41:37,271
- Ah, fuck!
- Caesar, it slipped.

525
00:41:37,346 --> 00:41:40,247
- I was trying to get ready.
- How the fuck did you do that?

526
00:41:40,322 --> 00:41:42,710
Caesar, it was an accident.
I didn't mean to.

527
00:41:42,786 --> 00:41:45,403
- I'll get some more.
- There's no fuckin' time!

528
00:41:45,475 --> 00:41:47,383
Don't be silly.
There's lots of time.

529
00:41:47,458 --> 00:41:50,140
I'll clean this up and I'll be back
before you're even dressed.

530
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:51,736
Fuck, Vi!

531
00:41:58,148 --> 00:42:00,602
When you open the door,
I'll be there.

532
00:42:05,188 --> 00:42:06,877
What if he sees you?

533
00:42:06,948 --> 00:42:08,540
He won't.

534
00:42:08,612 --> 00:42:11,426
You can't know for certain
that he won't see you.

535
00:42:12,836 --> 00:42:15,737
- Trust me.
- I'm just asking. What if?

536
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:18,205
If he does...

537
00:42:19,813 --> 00:42:21,786
then I won't have a choice,
will I?

538
00:42:25,094 --> 00:42:27,329
When I'm inside,
I'll get the money.

539
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:10,206
I'm gonna need something
to fill the case.

540
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:12,133
Hide it near the desk.

541
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:14,468
And at that point...

542
00:43:17,289 --> 00:43:19,142
there's no turning back.

543
00:43:30,761 --> 00:43:32,450
When I get the scotch...

544
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,485
how do I know
you won't just take off?

545
00:43:36,458 --> 00:43:39,752
The same way I'll know that you
went to go get the scotch.

546
00:43:39,819 --> 00:43:40,832
Trust.

547
00:43:40,906 --> 00:43:42,977
I still don't see how
I'm gonna get away clean...

548
00:43:43,051 --> 00:43:44,904
with all the money
in the apartment.

549
00:43:44,971 --> 00:43:47,108
Everyone's gonna think
I took it.

550
00:43:47,179 --> 00:43:48,487
- Not Caesar.
- Why?

551
00:43:48,555 --> 00:43:50,659
'Cause of what
you're gonna tell him.

552
00:43:50,732 --> 00:43:52,705
You gotta be as real as you can.

553
00:43:53,516 --> 00:43:56,297
The moment you walk through
that door with the scotch...

554
00:43:56,364 --> 00:43:57,704
you'll be covered.

555
00:43:58,892 --> 00:44:01,989
That moment's the most important
moment of the plan.

556
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:05,539
'Cause if you're real enough, he's
gonna believe you, 'cause deep down...

557
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:06,788
he'll want to.

558
00:44:06,861 --> 00:44:09,991
C? Shit, I'm sorry.
They were early.

559
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:13,986
- What are you talkin' about?
- They just left, didn't they?

560
00:44:14,061 --> 00:44:16,875
- What, are you drunk?
- They weren't just up here?

561
00:44:16,941 --> 00:44:19,274
No, they're still on their way.

562
00:44:19,342 --> 00:44:20,934
That doesn't make any sense.

563
00:44:22,478 --> 00:44:25,543
- Why?
- I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

564
00:44:28,206 --> 00:44:29,252
What?

565
00:44:29,325 --> 00:44:32,673
Yeah. I was getting out of my car,
and I saw him in his BMW.

566
00:44:34,702 --> 00:44:37,002
- Nah, it couldn't have been.
- It was him, Caesar.

567
00:44:37,071 --> 00:44:38,346
I'm positive.

568
00:44:40,495 --> 00:44:41,639
Vi, that's impossible.

569
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:44,525
Caesar, I know Johnnie.

570
00:44:44,591 --> 00:44:46,051
It was him.

571
00:44:46,128 --> 00:44:48,712
I screamed when I saw him.
I couldn't believe I missed him.

572
00:44:48,784 --> 00:44:51,914
I knew you were gonna be upset, so I
thought I'd stop and apologize...

573
00:44:51,984 --> 00:44:54,088
and give Gino the scotch, but...

574
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:57,226
I honked a couple of times, and Johnnie
didn't even hear me. He didn't stop.

575
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,515
But...

576
00:45:02,608 --> 00:45:04,778
Gino's plane doesn't get here
for another half hour.

577
00:45:08,913 --> 00:45:10,919
Actually, I didn't see Gino
in the car.

578
00:45:22,098 --> 00:45:25,839
If Caesar hates Johnnie as much as
you say, when he opens that case...

579
00:45:25,906 --> 00:45:29,385
he's gonna know in his gut
that Johnnie just fucked him.

580
00:45:29,458 --> 00:45:33,166
He'll have no choice.
He can't go after Gino or Johnnie.

581
00:45:33,234 --> 00:45:35,142
There's only one way out.

582
00:45:36,018 --> 00:45:37,326
He'll have to run.

583
00:45:39,123 --> 00:45:40,910
And if he runs...

584
00:45:40,979 --> 00:45:43,596
everyone will assume
he took the money.

585
00:45:43,667 --> 00:45:46,481
You'll be clean,
and we'll be rich.

586
00:45:46,548 --> 00:45:48,848
Jesus, that's beautiful.

587
00:45:50,388 --> 00:45:53,965
If you're this goddamn smart,
how did you ever get caught?

588
00:45:54,837 --> 00:45:56,974
I had a partner once.

589
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,505
She fucked me.

590
00:46:00,852 --> 00:46:02,225
I won't.

591
00:46:05,237 --> 00:46:07,024
I think we're gonna find out.

592
00:46:11,413 --> 00:46:13,452
- Oh, God!
- Caesar?

593
00:46:15,798 --> 00:46:17,651
No.

594
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:20,211
C?

595
00:46:21,814 --> 00:46:23,023
Oh, no.

596
00:46:24,918 --> 00:46:25,899
Oh, God.

597
00:46:29,878 --> 00:46:32,178
Vi.

598
00:46:32,246 --> 00:46:33,838
Vi, I've been set up.

599
00:46:33,911 --> 00:46:35,371
Johnnie?

600
00:46:35,447 --> 00:46:36,875
That fuck!

601
00:46:37,655 --> 00:46:40,021
That rat fuck!

602
00:46:40,087 --> 00:46:42,769
That motherless rat fuck!

603
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:46,134
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?

604
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,424
Jesus Christ. Violet,
open your fucking eyes.

605
00:46:53,497 --> 00:46:55,667
Johnnie hates me
as much as I hate him.

606
00:46:57,144 --> 00:46:58,997
I hate that motherless rat fuck.

607
00:46:59,064 --> 00:47:02,063
- I fuckin' hate him.
- But you know he did it.

608
00:47:02,872 --> 00:47:05,740
Yeah. So what?
So fucking what?

609
00:47:07,001 --> 00:47:10,513
Look, the money is gone, right?

610
00:47:10,586 --> 00:47:12,308
Gino's coming to get it.

611
00:47:12,377 --> 00:47:15,507
Do you think Gino is going to believe me
when I tell him...

612
00:47:15,578 --> 00:47:18,392
his little rat fuck son stole it?

613
00:47:18,458 --> 00:47:21,140
'Cause I don't.
You know what I think?

614
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,827
I'm a dead man.
I'm one in the back of the head.

615
00:47:23,899 --> 00:47:25,359
That's what I think.

616
00:47:27,226 --> 00:47:28,566
What are we gonna do?

617
00:47:29,595 --> 00:47:32,409
I know what Johnnie wants me to do.
Johnnie wants me to run.

618
00:47:32,475 --> 00:47:34,328
He wants me outta here.

619
00:47:34,395 --> 00:47:37,263
But if I run, then everybody thinks
I fucking did it...

620
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:39,247
and he gets away
with two million clean.

621
00:47:41,148 --> 00:47:43,252
I can see him right now...

622
00:47:43,324 --> 00:47:45,297
on the way to get Gino,
laughin' at me!

623
00:47:45,372 --> 00:47:47,159
Laughin' at me, laughin' at me !

624
00:47:47,229 --> 00:47:48,853
Laughin' at me!

625
00:47:48,924 --> 00:47:50,832
Fuckin' laughin' at me!

626
00:47:52,765 --> 00:47:55,830
Don't! Please.
Don't touch me, okay?

627
00:47:55,901 --> 00:47:58,485
I gotta think. I gotta
fuckin' think this through!

628
00:48:00,061 --> 00:48:02,361
Caesar, I think we should run.

629
00:48:02,429 --> 00:48:05,046
We have to go now,
before it's too late!

630
00:48:05,118 --> 00:48:07,484
Please, Violet, leave me alone.

631
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:08,977
Please, all right?

632
00:48:09,054 --> 00:48:11,125
Just leave me the fuck alone!

633
00:48:14,719 --> 00:48:15,994
All right, Caesar.

634
00:48:17,822 --> 00:48:20,821
I gotta think, that's all.
I just gotta think.

635
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:46,837
- It's me.
- What happened?

636
00:48:46,912 --> 00:48:50,206
He totally freaked out.
I've never seen him like this.

637
00:48:50,273 --> 00:48:51,962
He's out of his fucking mind.

638
00:48:52,033 --> 00:48:54,781
That's all right, as long as
he believes it was Johnnie.

639
00:48:54,849 --> 00:48:57,336
Believes it?
Jesus!

640
00:48:57,409 --> 00:49:00,277
It's driving him crazy.
He wants to kill him.

641
00:49:01,441 --> 00:49:03,349
I don't know, Corky.

642
00:49:03,426 --> 00:49:06,840
I'm getting really nervous.
I don't know what he's gonna do.

643
00:49:06,914 --> 00:49:09,695
It's all right, Violet.
It's working.

644
00:49:09,762 --> 00:49:12,346
All we gotta do is wait him out
and see what he does.

645
00:49:12,418 --> 00:49:14,326
What if he doesn't run?

646
00:49:15,874 --> 00:49:17,847
That means he'll probably
kill Johnnie.

647
00:49:17,923 --> 00:49:19,831
Oh, Christ!
I have to get out of here!

648
00:49:19,906 --> 00:49:24,509
Listen, if he doesn't run,
all you gotta do is break down.

649
00:49:24,579 --> 00:49:26,945
Go into the bedroom
and pack some things.

650
00:49:27,011 --> 00:49:29,825
Start crying. Tell him you love him,
but you can't take it.

651
00:49:29,891 --> 00:49:33,370
You're sorry, but you gotta Ieave,
and just waIk out.

652
00:49:33,444 --> 00:49:35,450
All right. Okay.

653
00:49:35,523 --> 00:49:38,456
We're almost there.
Just hang on.

654
00:49:38,532 --> 00:49:39,610
He's coming!

655
00:49:42,116 --> 00:49:45,246
I know what I have to do.
I have to get the money back.

656
00:49:45,317 --> 00:49:48,033
The money?
The money's gone.

657
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:51,295
No, Johnnie's got it.
I gotta get it back.

658
00:49:52,165 --> 00:49:53,538
It could be anywhere.

659
00:49:53,606 --> 00:49:55,547
There's not enough time, Violet.

660
00:49:55,621 --> 00:49:57,627
Johnnie's gotta pick up Gino
at the airport, right?

661
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:01,528
That means he's probably got
the money with him in the car.

662
00:50:01,605 --> 00:50:03,011
Did he see you?

663
00:50:03,077 --> 00:50:05,497
No.

664
00:50:05,574 --> 00:50:07,842
Good. That's good.

665
00:50:11,782 --> 00:50:13,853
That means I got the edge.

666
00:50:13,926 --> 00:50:15,834
He doesn't know I know.

667
00:50:19,143 --> 00:50:21,149
That's why he put
the paper in the case.

668
00:50:22,535 --> 00:50:24,476
He wants me
to hand it to Gino.

669
00:50:26,279 --> 00:50:28,187
Then there's no doubt I did it.

670
00:50:29,575 --> 00:50:31,428
Gino will put a bullet in me himself.

671
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:35,836
But that's not gonna happen.

672
00:50:39,496 --> 00:50:42,528
That jack-off's not gonna set me up.
No way. Not like this.

673
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:45,508
This is insane.

674
00:50:50,442 --> 00:50:51,902
What are you doin'?

675
00:50:53,066 --> 00:50:54,374
I'm leaving.

676
00:50:54,441 --> 00:50:57,855
I don't want any part of this shit.
I don't want to be involved.

677
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:00,100
- You can't leave.
- The hell I can't.

678
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:05,412
- I need you.
- You don't need me.

679
00:51:05,482 --> 00:51:07,335
You've never needed me.

680
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:09,408
I can't help you, understand?

681
00:51:17,836 --> 00:51:19,744
I can't let you leave.

682
00:51:20,843 --> 00:51:24,191
If you're not with me,
I have to assume you're against me.

683
00:51:25,611 --> 00:51:27,464
Caesar, this is crazy.

684
00:51:27,531 --> 00:51:30,596
Maybe it is.
Maybe it isn't.

685
00:51:31,916 --> 00:51:34,216
Maybe you dropped that bottle
of scotch by accident.

686
00:51:34,284 --> 00:51:35,527
Maybe you didn't.

687
00:51:36,492 --> 00:51:39,425
I would've been so easy...

688
00:51:39,501 --> 00:51:41,474
to let him in as you left.

689
00:51:42,989 --> 00:51:44,449
You can't believe that.

690
00:51:44,525 --> 00:51:46,564
I've seen the way he looks at you.

691
00:51:47,437 --> 00:51:49,345
He's always wanted you.

692
00:51:50,381 --> 00:51:52,202
Maybe two million bucks
finally bought you.

693
00:52:01,614 --> 00:52:03,020
I'm sorry, Violet.

694
00:52:07,086 --> 00:52:08,426
I wanna trust you.

695
00:52:09,454 --> 00:52:10,979
But you understand.

696
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:20,803
I don't have any other choice.

697
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:40,426
You sure you don't want a drink?

698
00:53:05,522 --> 00:53:06,982
- Hello.
- Yeah, we're here.

699
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,911
- Hey, Johnnie.
- Open the fuckin' door.

700
00:53:08,979 --> 00:53:10,352
Sure. Come on up.

701
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:47,375
Gino.

702
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:52,498
Good to see you.
Vi, look who's here.

703
00:53:52,565 --> 00:53:54,473
Hello, Gino.
How are you?

704
00:54:01,782 --> 00:54:04,432
- You shouldn't have hit me.
- You wanna get into this now?

705
00:54:04,502 --> 00:54:06,027
No, Caesar, not now.

706
00:54:14,872 --> 00:54:17,238
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.

707
00:54:32,121 --> 00:54:34,837
Gino, Glenlivet, right?

708
00:54:36,057 --> 00:54:38,838
And I'll have
whatever Violet's drinking.

709
00:54:38,905 --> 00:54:41,489
- I'm not drinking.
- Oh, well, then neither will I.

710
00:54:43,257 --> 00:54:45,361
No, I'll have
a Tanqueray and tonic.

711
00:54:46,746 --> 00:54:48,687
Caesar, two T&T's.

712
00:55:06,651 --> 00:55:10,392
Salud, eh?
Roy, Pop, Violet.

713
00:55:10,459 --> 00:55:11,734
Caesar.

714
00:55:13,723 --> 00:55:15,609
Uh-uh, no, no, Johnnie.

715
00:55:15,676 --> 00:55:17,944
- I gotta make a bet.
- No goddamn phone. Not now.

716
00:55:19,708 --> 00:55:22,674
Cesare, come and sit.
We're gonna talk now.

717
00:55:22,748 --> 00:55:25,562
Johnnie, you too.
No, no.

718
00:55:28,924 --> 00:55:30,297
Cesare, look at me.

719
00:55:32,093 --> 00:55:34,066
Johnnie, he said to me
what happened.

720
00:55:36,061 --> 00:55:40,567
Cesare, you gotta do me a favor.
A personal favor for me, huh?

721
00:55:41,598 --> 00:55:44,859
You gotta start respecting Johnnie
the way you respect me.

722
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:49,756
Good, good.

723
00:55:51,165 --> 00:55:54,459
And you, Johnnie,
you gotta stop acting stupid.

724
00:55:55,870 --> 00:55:58,203
You gotta earn this respect
that Cesare's gonna give.

725
00:56:02,463 --> 00:56:03,672
Good!

726
00:56:03,743 --> 00:56:05,018
Done!

727
00:56:07,711 --> 00:56:08,986
Now...

728
00:56:11,264 --> 00:56:12,823
where's my money?

729
00:56:22,144 --> 00:56:23,866
We know how this was done?

730
00:56:25,504 --> 00:56:27,641
Yeah. I know.

731
00:56:28,448 --> 00:56:30,618
And it won't happen again?

732
00:56:32,225 --> 00:56:34,198
Good. Done. We go now.

733
00:56:34,273 --> 00:56:36,181
Wait a minute, Pop.
Jesus Christ.

734
00:56:36,257 --> 00:56:39,322
You got two hours
till your plane leaves.

735
00:56:41,218 --> 00:56:42,842
Just relax. Have a drink.

736
00:56:42,914 --> 00:56:46,328
Caesare, Glenlivet.

737
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:55,449
So, Caesar, tell me something.

738
00:56:55,523 --> 00:56:57,496
What did it total out at?

739
00:56:58,562 --> 00:56:59,968
2.176.

740
00:57:00,034 --> 00:57:02,171
Unbelievable.

741
00:57:03,011 --> 00:57:04,536
Can you believe that, Violet?

742
00:57:04,611 --> 00:57:06,650
Johnnie.

743
00:57:06,724 --> 00:57:08,632
I just wanna know one thing.

744
00:57:09,764 --> 00:57:12,578
Just one thing after he made
such a big deal about it.

745
00:57:13,636 --> 00:57:15,806
I'll bet it wasn't such a big deal,
huh, Caesar?

746
00:57:17,957 --> 00:57:19,482
What's that, Johnnie?

747
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,047
The money.

748
00:57:22,116 --> 00:57:24,024
I'll bet it wasn't nothin'
to make it clean...

749
00:57:24,100 --> 00:57:26,303
after you made such
a big fuckin' deal about it.

750
00:57:26,372 --> 00:57:28,280
- What I tell you--
- It's important to me, Pop.

751
00:57:28,357 --> 00:57:31,389
It's a simple question. If he'd
answer it, that's the end of it.

752
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:37,433
Where's this goin', Johnnie?

753
00:57:38,502 --> 00:57:41,184
Just admit it.

754
00:57:43,175 --> 00:57:44,548
Admit what?

755
00:57:44,614 --> 00:57:46,947
That you overreacted!

756
00:57:47,015 --> 00:57:49,948
You lost it! Not me.

757
00:57:51,942 --> 00:57:53,883
It was your mistake.

758
00:57:53,958 --> 00:57:57,153
You wanna play it this way?

759
00:57:57,223 --> 00:57:59,164
I could play it this way.

760
00:58:00,455 --> 00:58:03,269
You wanna know who made a mistake?

761
00:58:05,032 --> 00:58:06,405
Open the case.

762
00:58:06,472 --> 00:58:08,358
- Caesar.
- Shut up, Violet.

763
00:58:08,424 --> 00:58:10,245
This is between me and Johnnie.

764
00:58:13,416 --> 00:58:15,073
You wanna do this now?

765
00:58:17,353 --> 00:58:19,490
Let's do it.

766
00:58:22,568 --> 00:58:24,421
Open the fuckin' case.

767
00:58:30,025 --> 00:58:31,878
Open the case.

768
00:58:40,554 --> 00:58:41,927
Where's the fucking key?

769
00:58:41,995 --> 00:58:43,423
You don't need a key.

770
00:58:43,499 --> 00:58:45,570
Then how the fuck can I open it?

771
00:58:46,667 --> 00:58:49,000
The same way you did before.

772
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,586
What are you talking about?

773
00:58:53,963 --> 00:58:55,816
All right, Johnnie.

774
00:59:01,484 --> 00:59:02,890
Violet...

775
00:59:03,916 --> 00:59:06,053
get me another drink.

776
00:59:22,988 --> 00:59:26,599
- What is this?
- Don't you fucking move!

777
00:59:26,669 --> 00:59:29,035
- Where is it, fuckface?

778
00:59:29,101 --> 00:59:30,856
- Where's what?
- The money!

779
00:59:30,925 --> 00:59:34,786
Okay, Caesar, if you don't
put down that gun--

780
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:36,454
Sit down.

781
00:59:38,606 --> 00:59:40,459
Caesar, what is this?

782
00:59:40,526 --> 00:59:43,176
Gino, your son stole this money
to set me up!

783
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:45,896
He fuckin' stole it,
and I can prove it!

784
00:59:45,968 --> 00:59:48,171
Violet, tell them.

785
00:59:48,239 --> 00:59:49,961
Tell them!

786
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:52,517
For God's sake, Johnnie,
do what he says.

787
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:56,233
For Christ's sake!
This isn't happening.

788
00:59:58,863 --> 01:00:00,771
Next one blows off
your fuckin' dick!

789
01:00:00,848 --> 01:00:04,459
I'm looking at a dead man.
You're a fuckin' dead man!

790
01:00:04,528 --> 01:00:06,381
Enough!

791
01:00:06,448 --> 01:00:09,578
- Gino, don't.
- Do you point the gun at me?

792
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:14,853
Do you know who I am?
I am Gino Marzzone!

793
01:00:18,672 --> 01:00:20,525
No, Gino, please.

794
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,268
Gino, sit down.

795
01:00:25,937 --> 01:00:27,659
We're family, Cesare.

796
01:00:27,729 --> 01:00:30,630
Family, Caesar.

797
01:00:30,706 --> 01:00:32,166
Family.

798
01:00:33,426 --> 01:00:34,799
Now...

799
01:00:36,466 --> 01:00:38,319
give it to me.

800
01:00:48,051 --> 01:00:50,057
Good man.

801
01:01:23,829 --> 01:01:25,322
Don't shoot.

802
01:01:50,487 --> 01:01:53,301
I had to do it, Violet.

803
01:01:53,367 --> 01:01:56,497
You saw it.
I had no choice.

804
01:01:57,848 --> 01:01:59,887
It was Johnnie.

805
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:02,926
Lying rat fuck.
He made me do it.

806
01:02:04,217 --> 01:02:06,933
Hey! Hey!

807
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:11,222
You stupid fuck!
You think you could set me up? Huh?

808
01:02:15,737 --> 01:02:18,900
I'm a dead man, Johnnie?
I'm a fucking dead man?

809
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:21,619
Guess again, Johnnie.
Who's the dead man? Who?

810
01:02:21,690 --> 01:02:25,038
Who's dead, fuckface?
Who? Who?

811
01:02:25,114 --> 01:02:27,796
I can't hear you, Johnnie.
Guess again.

812
01:02:27,865 --> 01:02:31,606
Take another guess, Johnnie.
Take another fuckin' guess.

813
01:02:42,939 --> 01:02:44,399
What are you doing?

814
01:02:54,940 --> 01:02:56,793
Maybe three hours.

815
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:59,248
Caesar, what are you going to do?

816
01:03:00,572 --> 01:03:03,222
- We're gonna get the money back.
- What?

817
01:03:03,292 --> 01:03:07,284
Violet, if we get the money back,
then none of this ever happened.

818
01:03:07,357 --> 01:03:11,251
Caesar, you just killed
Gino Marzzone.

819
01:03:11,325 --> 01:03:15,066
No, I didn't.
Not if the bodies disappear.

820
01:03:15,133 --> 01:03:17,815
Not if the money's here.
Then they never showed up.

821
01:03:17,886 --> 01:03:20,405
What happened to them?

822
01:03:20,477 --> 01:03:23,225
I don't know.
Maybe we'll never know.

823
01:03:26,558 --> 01:03:29,306
My guess, it was a job.

824
01:03:30,494 --> 01:03:34,235
Maybe the Carpella's.
All part of the business.

825
01:03:34,303 --> 01:03:37,717
Look, once we find the money,
then everything's gonna be all right.

826
01:03:43,423 --> 01:03:45,276
Somebody's coming.

827
01:03:49,183 --> 01:03:51,571
- Fuck!
- Oh, no.

828
01:03:51,647 --> 01:03:53,020
Fuck!

829
01:03:54,624 --> 01:03:57,623
Caesar, what are we gonna do?

830
01:03:57,697 --> 01:04:01,340
They're just cops.
Stall 'em as long as you can.

831
01:04:18,593 --> 01:04:20,566
Gino, man.

832
01:04:23,362 --> 01:04:25,914
Come on. Come on!

833
01:04:38,212 --> 01:04:39,585
Answer it.

834
01:04:46,564 --> 01:04:49,116
- Hello?
- This is the police, ma'am.

835
01:04:49,188 --> 01:04:50,561
The police?

836
01:04:50,628 --> 01:04:53,442
We had a report of gunfire.
Can you buzz us in, please?

837
01:04:53,508 --> 01:04:56,987
- Gunfire? Is this a joke?
- No joke, ma'am.

838
01:05:13,925 --> 01:05:16,029
- Please open the door.
- Um.

839
01:05:17,766 --> 01:05:20,699
How do I know
that you're really the police?

840
01:05:23,526 --> 01:05:26,340
Ma'am, you have to open the door.

841
01:05:27,687 --> 01:05:29,376
All right.

842
01:07:07,694 --> 01:07:12,068
Now, if you're thinking
about doing something stupid...

843
01:07:12,142 --> 01:07:17,094
remember, I just killed
Gino Marzzone.

844
01:07:17,166 --> 01:07:19,401
You understand what that means?

845
01:07:20,719 --> 01:07:23,107
They're just cops.

846
01:07:34,192 --> 01:07:36,646
See? We're for real.

847
01:07:38,704 --> 01:07:42,445
I'm sorry. It's just that
sometimes you hear stories.

848
01:07:42,512 --> 01:07:44,104
You did the right thing.

849
01:07:52,689 --> 01:07:54,575
Come on in.

850
01:07:58,193 --> 01:08:00,909
Hey, hey! Chicago's finest.

851
01:08:00,978 --> 01:08:03,465
How's it going tonight, fellas?

852
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,062
Very good, sir?

853
01:08:05,138 --> 01:08:08,235
I'm sorry. I got a bum ear.
Can't hear shit with it.

854
01:08:08,306 --> 01:08:10,858
My name is Caesar,
and this here is my Violet.

855
01:08:13,170 --> 01:08:17,773
So, Violet tells me there's
some problems about gunshots.

856
01:08:17,842 --> 01:08:21,136
Uh, yes, sir.
A neighbor in the building called in.

857
01:08:21,203 --> 01:08:24,464
- I think we know what happened.
- Probably just the television.

858
01:08:25,747 --> 01:08:27,720
Oh, the television.

859
01:08:27,795 --> 01:08:30,347
Honey, why don't you turn it off?

860
01:08:32,852 --> 01:08:34,345
This happened before.

861
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:36,273
This ear, I was born with it.

862
01:08:36,340 --> 01:08:39,983
The batteries went dead
on my hearing aid. I'm sorry.

863
01:08:40,052 --> 01:08:41,873
- It's all right.
- No big deal.

864
01:08:41,939 --> 01:08:45,102
I hate to trouble you guys.
Can I get you a beer?

865
01:08:45,172 --> 01:08:47,756
Uh, no. Not on duty. Sorry.

866
01:08:48,885 --> 01:08:51,339
But, uh, do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

867
01:08:53,910 --> 01:08:56,113
No. Sure.
It's right over here.

868
01:08:56,182 --> 01:08:57,839
Thanks.

869
01:08:57,909 --> 01:09:00,461
Listen, do you mind
if I make myself a drink?

870
01:09:00,533 --> 01:09:01,993
Yeah, right there.

871
01:09:02,070 --> 01:09:04,622
Sure. Go right ahead, sir.

872
01:09:28,952 --> 01:09:30,805
This is a beautiful place.

873
01:09:30,872 --> 01:09:32,878
Thank you.

874
01:09:44,312 --> 01:09:46,383
Is this a condo?

875
01:09:52,153 --> 01:09:54,006
Okay, let's roll.

876
01:09:57,306 --> 01:10:00,785
Oh, try to keep extra batteries
around for the aid, okay?

877
01:10:00,858 --> 01:10:02,286
Good idea.

878
01:10:06,363 --> 01:10:08,216
Come on. Let's go.

879
01:10:16,699 --> 01:10:18,454
Shit.

880
01:10:33,085 --> 01:10:34,993
Fuck! Where is it?

881
01:10:37,180 --> 01:10:38,553
Think.

882
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,426
It's gotta be at his place.

883
01:10:44,028 --> 01:10:45,750
Get in the car.

884
01:10:45,821 --> 01:10:48,667
- Caesar, I don't think--
- Get in the fucking car!

885
01:11:11,966 --> 01:11:14,201
Two million dollars, Corky.

886
01:11:16,351 --> 01:11:20,692
Two million dollars.
It's gotta be here. It's gotta be.

887
01:11:20,767 --> 01:11:24,508
I just-- I gotta think.
Think Iike Johnnie.

888
01:11:24,576 --> 01:11:28,350
Okay, I'm Johnnie.

889
01:11:32,513 --> 01:11:34,366
I come in.

890
01:11:36,193 --> 01:11:37,566
Where did I put it?

891
01:11:39,104 --> 01:11:42,965
That's a Iot of fuckin' money,
and I gotta hide it.

892
01:11:44,033 --> 01:11:46,137
I gotta hide it.
I don't have much time.

893
01:11:46,209 --> 01:11:50,364
I gotta get to the airport,
pick up my fuckin' daddy!

894
01:11:56,994 --> 01:12:00,091
I can't wait to see Caesar's face
when he finds out.

895
01:12:09,922 --> 01:12:13,183
- Where did he put it?
- C.

896
01:12:16,771 --> 01:12:18,624
Think. Think.

897
01:12:26,852 --> 01:12:29,404
Where is it, you motherfucker?

898
01:12:29,476 --> 01:12:31,329
Where? Where?

899
01:12:48,646 --> 01:12:50,303
C?

900
01:12:52,294 --> 01:12:54,147
C.

901
01:13:01,158 --> 01:13:03,197
It's not here, Caesar.

902
01:13:07,111 --> 01:13:08,964
Where is it?

903
01:13:09,031 --> 01:13:13,089
I don't know.
It could be anywhere.

904
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:15,776
We don't even know
if he was alone, Caesar.

905
01:13:15,848 --> 01:13:18,716
Come on.
We have to get out of here.

906
01:13:18,791 --> 01:13:20,797
We don't have much time.

907
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:29,573
What are you doing?

908
01:13:40,905 --> 01:13:44,133
Gotta buy more time. More time.

909
01:13:44,202 --> 01:13:46,568
Who are you gonna call?

910
01:13:55,594 --> 01:13:57,447
- Yeah?
- Hey, Mickey.

911
01:13:57,515 --> 01:13:58,888
Oh, God.

912
01:14:00,459 --> 01:14:02,312
Caesar, what the fuck time is it?

913
01:14:02,379 --> 01:14:06,306
Oh, Mickey, did I wake you up?
Listen, I'm sorry. I know it's late.

914
01:14:06,379 --> 01:14:09,542
I don't know if this is a big deal,
but they ain't showed up yet.

915
01:14:09,611 --> 01:14:11,464
What? They ain't there?

916
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:15,392
No. I-I-I called the airport.
The plane landed on time.

917
01:14:15,468 --> 01:14:18,783
I even called over at Johnnie's house,
but there was no answer there.

918
01:14:18,860 --> 01:14:21,859
Okay. Let me call around.
I'll see what I can do.

919
01:14:21,932 --> 01:14:23,785
Don't go anywhere, okay?

920
01:14:23,853 --> 01:14:25,859
Yeah, okay, sure.

921
01:14:25,933 --> 01:14:28,714
Caesar, you still have the money?

922
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:30,667
Oh, yeah, Mickey,
I still got the money.

923
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:33,317
Starin' right at it.

924
01:14:33,389 --> 01:14:36,071
Good. Sit tight.
I'll call you.

925
01:14:37,677 --> 01:14:39,050
Bye.

926
01:14:51,055 --> 01:14:53,542
So I'll start packing.
You know what you have to do.

927
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:57,029
I'll use Johnnie's car
to dump the bodies in the lake.

928
01:14:57,103 --> 01:14:59,687
I need plastic bags, rope and tape.

929
01:15:00,752 --> 01:15:03,052
Just hurry.

930
01:15:15,632 --> 01:15:17,540
Please, Corky, please.

931
01:15:22,225 --> 01:15:24,613
- Thank God.
- I'm still here.

932
01:15:24,689 --> 01:15:26,989
I was so afraid
you were going to leave me.

933
01:15:28,209 --> 01:15:30,412
You don't quit on me, Violet.
I won't quit on you.

934
01:15:36,817 --> 01:15:39,533
Corky, it worked.
He's going to run.

935
01:15:39,602 --> 01:15:42,416
He needs to take care of the bodies
to buy himseIf a little time...

936
01:15:42,482 --> 01:15:44,815
but as soon as he leaves,
it's over.

937
01:15:44,882 --> 01:15:46,855
Just a little while longer.

938
01:15:48,499 --> 01:15:49,872
Corky...

939
01:15:54,067 --> 01:15:55,920
I want to tell you something.

940
01:15:55,988 --> 01:15:57,841
I know, Violet.

941
01:16:01,492 --> 01:16:02,865
I know.

942
01:16:06,611 --> 01:16:08,170
It's why I'm still here.

943
01:16:24,981 --> 01:16:26,540
Who was that?

944
01:16:26,613 --> 01:16:28,816
Vi, who the fuck was that?

945
01:16:31,222 --> 01:16:34,188
Did you call Mickey?
Did you call Mickey?

946
01:16:34,261 --> 01:16:36,114
Did you!

947
01:16:55,160 --> 01:16:58,006
Mickey, is that you?

948
01:16:58,072 --> 01:16:59,053
Fuck.

949
01:17:23,513 --> 01:17:25,683
Who is that?
Who's over there?

950
01:17:25,753 --> 01:17:28,883
Who's over there?
Tell me! Tell me!

951
01:17:28,954 --> 01:17:33,012
No! Stop! Caesar! Caesar!

952
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:41,718
No! No! No! Caesar!

953
01:18:25,917 --> 01:18:28,305
Drop the fucking gun or die.

954
01:18:29,406 --> 01:18:31,095
Drop it!

955
01:18:31,166 --> 01:18:32,506
Turn around.

956
01:18:37,854 --> 01:18:39,227
You?

957
01:18:41,150 --> 01:18:43,003
Holy fucking Christ.

958
01:18:47,263 --> 01:18:49,563
You gotta be fucking kiddin' me.

959
01:18:55,775 --> 01:18:58,141
You gotta be fucking kiddin' me.

960
01:18:59,616 --> 01:19:01,622
Hey!

961
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:03,450
Come on!

962
01:19:03,519 --> 01:19:06,006
Wake up. Wake up.

963
01:19:09,600 --> 01:19:12,599
Wake up, you fucking dyke.

964
01:19:14,753 --> 01:19:16,508
Good.

965
01:19:17,729 --> 01:19:19,353
I know everything now.

966
01:19:19,425 --> 01:19:22,806
So I don't wanna hear any
"I don't know" bullshit, understand?

967
01:19:25,026 --> 01:19:29,248
God, I shouId've seen this coming
the minute I met you.

968
01:19:30,978 --> 01:19:33,792
Everybody knows
your kind can't be trusted.

969
01:19:35,074 --> 01:19:36,927
Fuckin' queers.
You make me sick.

970
01:19:41,058 --> 01:19:43,097
But you made a fatal mistake.

971
01:19:43,171 --> 01:19:45,504
You tried to fuck the wrong guy...

972
01:19:45,571 --> 01:19:48,123
and I swear to you...

973
01:19:48,195 --> 01:19:50,201
I'm gonna kill you for it.

974
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:52,957
Where's my money?

975
01:19:53,027 --> 01:19:55,709
Don't tell him.
He can't kill you.

976
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:58,877
- Violet.
- Not until he has the money.

977
01:20:05,188 --> 01:20:08,416
Now, where is it?

978
01:20:08,485 --> 01:20:10,044
Lick me.

979
01:20:10,116 --> 01:20:13,792
Where is my money?

980
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,880
Either pull the trigger, or get
that fucking thing out of my face.

981
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:20,835
Fuckin' cunt.

982
01:20:20,902 --> 01:20:23,486
Caesar, stop acting
like an asshole and think.

983
01:20:23,558 --> 01:20:25,946
Violet, don't try
to tell me what to do.

984
01:20:26,022 --> 01:20:28,225
You need the money just like we do.

985
01:20:28,295 --> 01:20:30,661
- Shut up!
- Let us go. We'll make a deal.

986
01:20:30,725 --> 01:20:32,895
Shut the fuck up!

987
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:36,925
What did you do to her, huh?

988
01:20:36,998 --> 01:20:39,550
What did you fuckin' do to her?

989
01:20:39,622 --> 01:20:41,628
That's not my Violet!

990
01:20:43,495 --> 01:20:45,403
What did she do to you?

991
01:20:45,479 --> 01:20:47,201
Everything you couldn't.

992
01:20:53,064 --> 01:20:55,037
You ungrateful fuckin' bitch.

993
01:20:57,033 --> 01:21:00,228
Vi, you were nothing
before you met me.

994
01:21:00,296 --> 01:21:02,335
Don't you remember?
You had nothing.

995
01:21:03,688 --> 01:21:06,272
Who gave you this place, huh?

996
01:21:06,344 --> 01:21:08,252
Who gave it to you?

997
01:21:08,328 --> 01:21:10,782
I did, Vi. I did.

998
01:21:10,857 --> 01:21:14,205
You were nothing.
You had nothing.

999
01:21:14,281 --> 01:21:18,175
What a load of crap.
Take a look at yourself, Caesar.

1000
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:21,631
You're nothing but a common thug.
You launder money for the Mob.

1001
01:21:21,706 --> 01:21:23,941
You rent women
like you rented this apartment.

1002
01:21:24,010 --> 01:21:28,068
You used me, Caesar.
That's all. Just like I used you.

1003
01:21:28,138 --> 01:21:30,657
All part of the business.

1004
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:33,118
You betrayed me.

1005
01:21:33,194 --> 01:21:34,851
You murdered Gino.

1006
01:21:34,923 --> 01:21:37,856
Yeah, sure. You made me.
I had to do that.

1007
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:40,318
Bullshit! You did it.

1008
01:21:40,395 --> 01:21:43,045
You did it because you couldn't stand
the thought of Johnnie fucking you.

1009
01:21:43,116 --> 01:21:44,489
- Shut up.
- You shut up.

1010
01:21:44,555 --> 01:21:46,855
All right, Violet. All right!

1011
01:21:46,923 --> 01:21:49,704
You want the business, Violet?
All of the business?

1012
01:21:49,772 --> 01:21:52,967
I'll fucking give it to you.
I'll give you all of it.

1013
01:21:53,036 --> 01:21:55,336
I'm gonna make you fuckin' suffer.

1014
01:21:55,405 --> 01:21:58,470
Just like Shelly, Violet.
Just like fuckin' Shelly.

1015
01:22:04,876 --> 01:22:06,249
I'm sorry, Corky.

1016
01:22:06,317 --> 01:22:09,796
Don't be sorry.
Help me.

1017
01:22:17,806 --> 01:22:20,139
Oh, no, no, no!

1018
01:22:23,279 --> 01:22:25,667
Hey, Vi, do you remember these?

1019
01:22:28,814 --> 01:22:31,628
All right,
I'm gonna start with Violet.

1020
01:22:33,295 --> 01:22:36,742
So you get an idea
of what's comin'.

1021
01:22:42,223 --> 01:22:44,807
I'm gonna ask you ten questions.

1022
01:22:46,064 --> 01:22:49,543
Every time I don't get an answer...

1023
01:22:52,657 --> 01:22:54,663
I cut off a finger.

1024
01:23:02,289 --> 01:23:04,197
Where's the money?

1025
01:23:16,178 --> 01:23:17,671
It's Mickey.

1026
01:23:21,747 --> 01:23:25,324
I said, "Where's the money?"

1027
01:23:25,395 --> 01:23:27,882
All right, I'll tell you.

1028
01:23:29,554 --> 01:23:31,341
It's in the apartment next door.

1029
01:23:31,411 --> 01:23:33,417
I put it in the paint drums.

1030
01:23:33,490 --> 01:23:38,093
Good. Now, I promised you
I wouId kill you. Remember?

1031
01:23:38,163 --> 01:23:40,366
You can't kill me.

1032
01:23:40,436 --> 01:23:42,736
Oh, reaIIy? Why not?

1033
01:23:42,804 --> 01:23:44,363
I could be lying.

1034
01:23:46,740 --> 01:23:48,877
You're gonna be sorry you said that.

1035
01:24:05,781 --> 01:24:07,154
Motherfucker!

1036
01:24:10,518 --> 01:24:11,891
Son of a bitch.

1037
01:24:17,814 --> 01:24:19,787
Keys, keys, keys, keys.

1038
01:25:04,089 --> 01:25:08,910
I can kill you right now,
if that's what you want.

1039
01:25:08,986 --> 01:25:11,505
Or you can live.

1040
01:25:11,578 --> 01:25:13,748
But I need your help.

1041
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:17,330
You gotta help me make Mickey believe
that everything is normal.

1042
01:25:17,403 --> 01:25:20,151
Now, what do you wanna do?

1043
01:25:20,219 --> 01:25:22,803
Do you wanna live?

1044
01:25:53,373 --> 01:25:56,089
Oh! Oh, shit!

1045
01:25:56,157 --> 01:26:00,564
Christ! Mickey, you scared
the shit out of me.

1046
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,890
What are you guys doin'
with your peckers in your hand?

1047
01:26:04,958 --> 01:26:06,811
You gonna do me, Mickey?

1048
01:26:08,286 --> 01:26:09,811
No. There was no answer.

1049
01:26:09,886 --> 01:26:12,373
I thought I heard some knocking
at the door.

1050
01:26:12,447 --> 01:26:14,300
I was buzzing, I was knocking...

1051
01:26:14,367 --> 01:26:16,787
but I guess you couldn't hear me
on account of being in the shower.

1052
01:26:16,863 --> 01:26:19,796
Yeah, well, you know, Mick,
I'm all wound up.

1053
01:26:19,871 --> 01:26:23,219
I'm driving myself crazy
over this Gino thing, and, well...

1054
01:26:23,296 --> 01:26:26,611
Vi, you know, she thought maybe...

1055
01:26:26,687 --> 01:26:30,963
she could, you know,
relax me in the--

1056
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:36,086
That Violet is one nice lady.

1057
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,646
I wish someone
would help me relax.

1058
01:26:39,712 --> 01:26:44,315
Uh, let me get you guys
a drink, huh?

1059
01:26:44,385 --> 01:26:47,199
I got scotch,
whatever you want.

1060
01:26:50,305 --> 01:26:51,929
We was worried about you.

1061
01:26:52,002 --> 01:26:53,561
Me? Why?

1062
01:26:53,633 --> 01:26:56,185
We went over to Johnnie's place,
just to check it out.

1063
01:26:56,257 --> 01:26:57,881
It was busted up, bad.

1064
01:26:57,953 --> 01:26:59,708
What?

1065
01:26:59,777 --> 01:27:02,143
Started thinking
maybe it's about the money.

1066
01:27:02,210 --> 01:27:05,689
So I call you,
but all I got is the busy signal.

1067
01:27:05,762 --> 01:27:08,576
I figure the phone is off the hook.
That's why I come rushing over here.

1068
01:27:08,643 --> 01:27:11,904
Fuck, the phone. Shit.
That was me. I did that.

1069
01:27:11,971 --> 01:27:15,352
Fuck! That was
a stupid thing to do, huh?

1070
01:27:16,515 --> 01:27:19,863
Hey, if Violet
was helping me relax...

1071
01:27:19,939 --> 01:27:21,760
I'd probably do the same thing.

1072
01:27:44,069 --> 01:27:46,337
Hey, Caes, can I ask you something?

1073
01:27:46,405 --> 01:27:48,291
Sure.

1074
01:27:49,381 --> 01:27:51,714
Why did you move
all the furniture around?

1075
01:27:56,038 --> 01:27:57,662
Let me guess.

1076
01:27:58,693 --> 01:28:00,993
That was Violet's idea too.

1077
01:28:04,198 --> 01:28:06,401
Yeah, uh, actually...

1078
01:28:06,470 --> 01:28:09,120
she was nervous
about Gino comin'...

1079
01:28:09,190 --> 01:28:11,131
and wanted everything
to look perfect and--

1080
01:28:11,206 --> 01:28:13,059
You know women, Mick.

1081
01:28:13,127 --> 01:28:17,436
Sure, Caes. They make us do
stupid things, don't they?

1082
01:28:23,879 --> 01:28:26,212
- Is that the money?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1083
01:28:26,279 --> 01:28:27,838
What did it total out at?

1084
01:28:27,912 --> 01:28:29,885
2.176.

1085
01:28:29,959 --> 01:28:31,812
That fuckin' Shelly.

1086
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,006
Gotta hand it to the guy,
but, Jesus...

1087
01:28:35,080 --> 01:28:37,762
if I were him, I would've
bailed a long time ago.

1088
01:28:37,832 --> 01:28:42,173
I mean, how much money
does a man need?

1089
01:28:43,753 --> 01:28:48,259
I remember, I was just staring
at all this goddamn money.

1090
01:28:48,330 --> 01:28:51,558
Shelly went down on his knees...

1091
01:28:51,625 --> 01:28:55,236
and the next thing I know,
Johnnie just blows his head off.

1092
01:28:56,906 --> 01:28:59,174
What a fuckin' mess.

1093
01:28:59,242 --> 01:29:01,095
Johnnie's laughing his ass off...

1094
01:29:01,162 --> 01:29:04,456
and that's when Caesar lost it.

1095
01:29:04,522 --> 01:29:05,950
And boom.

1096
01:29:06,026 --> 01:29:08,359
He cold-cocked him.

1097
01:29:08,427 --> 01:29:12,387
He cold-cocks fuckin'
Johnnie Marzzone.

1098
01:29:16,139 --> 01:29:19,367
Hey, Caesar.

1099
01:29:22,763 --> 01:29:24,136
Where's the key?

1100
01:29:25,164 --> 01:29:27,334
Um, the key--

1101
01:29:29,708 --> 01:29:33,569
Oh, they're in my pants
in the bathroom.

1102
01:29:33,644 --> 01:29:36,709
Ah, fuck it.
I don't need the key.

1103
01:29:38,701 --> 01:29:41,220
I didn't need a key
to get in here, did I?

1104
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:05,033
Who the hell could that be?

1105
01:30:09,551 --> 01:30:10,924
Are you gonna answer it?

1106
01:30:10,991 --> 01:30:12,419
Yeah.

1107
01:30:20,911 --> 01:30:22,568
- Hello?
- Hello, Caesar.

1108
01:30:22,639 --> 01:30:24,580
- This is Gino.
- What?

1109
01:30:24,655 --> 01:30:27,949
You're blowing your only chance,
asshole. Act like I'm Gino.

1110
01:30:29,424 --> 01:30:32,270
Holy Christ! We've been
worried sick about you, Gino.

1111
01:30:32,336 --> 01:30:33,709
- Good boy.
- It's Gino.

1112
01:30:33,777 --> 01:30:35,881
- Where the hell is he?
- We were in a car accident.

1113
01:30:35,953 --> 01:30:38,440
- They were in a car accident.
- But everybody's all right.

1114
01:30:38,513 --> 01:30:41,446
Everybody's all right.
Just bruises and shit.

1115
01:30:41,522 --> 01:30:44,368
Un-fucking-believabIe. I called
those highway patrols. Dumb fucks.

1116
01:30:44,434 --> 01:30:46,287
Mick, please.
I'm trying to hear Gino.

1117
01:30:46,354 --> 01:30:49,386
Now you listen to me, asshole.
I know your gun is behind the bar.

1118
01:30:49,459 --> 01:30:52,425
Either we make a deal right now,
or I hand this phone to Mickey.

1119
01:30:52,497 --> 01:30:53,870
I'm listening.

1120
01:30:53,938 --> 01:30:58,247
All right. I want what's mine.
I want half the money.

1121
01:30:58,322 --> 01:31:01,136
We get rid of Mickey,
and no one else dies.

1122
01:31:01,202 --> 01:31:04,332
No one. Say, "Yes, I understand."

1123
01:31:04,403 --> 01:31:06,256
Yes, I understand.

1124
01:31:06,323 --> 01:31:09,486
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's
off the Kennedy in the waiting room.

1125
01:31:09,556 --> 01:31:12,043
Stay on the phone
until I come out.

1126
01:31:12,115 --> 01:31:14,961
Okay. Right.

1127
01:31:15,027 --> 01:31:17,098
St. Mary's off the Kennedy.

1128
01:31:17,172 --> 01:31:18,731
Yeah.

1129
01:31:18,805 --> 01:31:20,330
Johnnie's okay?

1130
01:31:20,403 --> 01:31:22,736
Mickey?
What are you doing here?

1131
01:31:22,804 --> 01:31:25,421
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie.
They were in a car accident.

1132
01:31:25,492 --> 01:31:27,433
Oh, my God!
Is everybody all right?

1133
01:31:27,508 --> 01:31:29,612
- I think everything's okay.
- All right. Bye.

1134
01:31:29,684 --> 01:31:31,723
They're at St. Mary's.
Can you fucking believe this?

1135
01:31:31,797 --> 01:31:33,868
I can't fit them all in my car,
so give me your keys.

1136
01:31:33,941 --> 01:31:35,369
- Sure.
- You drive my car.

1137
01:31:35,445 --> 01:31:37,582
Vi! Vi!

1138
01:31:37,654 --> 01:31:41,482
Do me a favor. Go in my pants
in the bathroom and get my keys.

1139
01:31:41,557 --> 01:31:44,425
Come on. Let's go.
Vi, let's go!

1140
01:31:54,550 --> 01:31:57,364
- Thanks, V.
- Call me as soon as you get there.

1141
01:31:57,430 --> 01:31:59,469
Leave your phone on the hook.

1142
01:32:03,927 --> 01:32:05,933
Now, that's teamwork.

1143
01:32:06,008 --> 01:32:08,756
I should've let 'em kill you.

1144
01:32:08,824 --> 01:32:10,994
He would've done you too.

1145
01:32:11,064 --> 01:32:12,917
I knew I couldn't trust you.

1146
01:32:12,984 --> 01:32:16,660
Relax. I said
I would let you live...

1147
01:32:16,728 --> 01:32:18,931
and I will.

1148
01:32:20,184 --> 01:32:21,557
Maybe.

1149
01:32:28,889 --> 01:32:32,532
Let's go see if your dyke
was dumb enough to lie.

1150
01:32:32,601 --> 01:32:34,640
Let's go.

1151
01:32:59,130 --> 01:33:00,274
Yes.

1152
01:33:01,179 --> 01:33:02,738
No!

1153
01:33:05,468 --> 01:33:06,841
Violet!

1154
01:33:13,917 --> 01:33:15,770
Violet! Violet!

1155
01:33:22,140 --> 01:33:23,993
Violet!

1156
01:33:55,326 --> 01:33:57,179
Come on, please.

1157
01:34:05,152 --> 01:34:07,769
Bitch! You fuckin' bitch!

1158
01:34:30,401 --> 01:34:31,807
- Mickey?
- Violet?

1159
01:34:31,874 --> 01:34:34,556
Oh, God, Mickey.
He made me do it.

1160
01:34:34,625 --> 01:34:37,079
I was so afraid.
I didn't want to, Mickey.

1161
01:34:37,154 --> 01:34:40,022
It was Caesar, all Caesar.
He made me help him.

1162
01:34:40,098 --> 01:34:44,253
You have to help me.
Oh, God! Oh, God, he's coming!

1163
01:34:59,172 --> 01:35:01,178
Corky?

1164
01:35:06,468 --> 01:35:07,841
Oh, fuck.

1165
01:36:03,880 --> 01:36:06,148
Stop!

1166
01:36:07,177 --> 01:36:08,932
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

1167
01:36:11,881 --> 01:36:14,597
It's over, Caesar.

1168
01:36:15,944 --> 01:36:18,244
I called Mickey.
He's on his way.

1169
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:22,854
Get out of here, Caesar.

1170
01:36:22,921 --> 01:36:25,571
If you want to live,
you'd better start running.

1171
01:36:27,561 --> 01:36:30,113
All these years,
and you still don't know me.

1172
01:36:33,386 --> 01:36:34,759
But I know you.

1173
01:36:34,827 --> 01:36:36,386
Caesar, don't.

1174
01:36:37,707 --> 01:36:40,608
What are you gonna do
with that, Vi? Shoot me?

1175
01:36:42,123 --> 01:36:45,286
Kill me in cold blood?
I don't think so.

1176
01:36:45,354 --> 01:36:49,150
If you were gonna shoot me, Vi,
you'd have done it a long time ago.

1177
01:36:49,227 --> 01:36:54,114
If I were you, I'd have shot me
the minute I brought the money back.

1178
01:36:54,187 --> 01:36:58,245
But you didn't,
and I'llI tell you why.

1179
01:36:58,316 --> 01:37:00,584
You don't want to shoot me, Vi.

1180
01:37:02,124 --> 01:37:03,813
Do you?

1181
01:37:04,845 --> 01:37:06,120
Do you?

1182
01:37:07,565 --> 01:37:08,971
I know you don't.

1183
01:37:11,501 --> 01:37:14,118
Caesar, you don't know shit.

1184
01:37:59,024 --> 01:38:03,082
I'll never understand it, Mickey.
You didn't even call the police.

1185
01:38:03,153 --> 01:38:06,927
I told you. The family
doesn't want the police around.

1186
01:38:06,993 --> 01:38:09,807
We want to take care of it
ourselves, and we will.

1187
01:38:10,961 --> 01:38:14,058
I'll find him.
I swear I will.

1188
01:38:14,128 --> 01:38:15,981
I know you will.

1189
01:38:18,065 --> 01:38:20,104
Sure you're gonna be okay?

1190
01:38:20,178 --> 01:38:23,625
I mean, if you're having
second thoughts...

1191
01:38:25,170 --> 01:38:27,274
my offer still stands.

1192
01:38:27,346 --> 01:38:31,240
Thanks, Mickey,
but I have to get out.

1193
01:38:31,314 --> 01:38:35,404
You know, I have to get away
from all this.

1194
01:38:35,475 --> 01:38:37,328
But thanks.

1195
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:45,743
Thanks for everything.

1196
01:39:17,686 --> 01:39:19,757
- Hey.
- Hey.

1197
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:21,933
So, how'd it go?

1198
01:39:22,006 --> 01:39:24,972
- I'm here, aren't I?
- Mm-hmm.

1199
01:39:31,350 --> 01:39:33,770
Well, I thought we might need
a getaway car.

1200
01:39:33,847 --> 01:39:34,925
Hmm.

1201
01:39:37,175 --> 01:39:40,370
You know what the difference is
between you and me, Violet?

1202
01:39:40,439 --> 01:39:42,292
No.

1203
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:44,213
Me, neither.

1204
01:39:51,384 --> 01:39:52,877
*  Well, she's all you'd ever want *

1205
01:39:52,952 --> 01:39:56,147
*  She's the kind I'd like to flaunt
and take to dinner *

1206
01:40:06,233 --> 01:40:08,566
*  She's a lady *

1207
01:40:08,633 --> 01:40:12,429
*  Oh, oh, oh, she's a lady *

1208
01:40:12,505 --> 01:40:16,660
*  Talkin' about that little lady *

1209
01:40:16,729 --> 01:40:20,241
*  And the lady is mine *

1210
01:40:21,722 --> 01:40:23,477
*  But she's never in the way *

1211
01:40:23,546 --> 01:40:29,262
*  Always something nice to say
What a blessing *

1212
01:40:29,339 --> 01:40:31,280
*  I can leave her on her own *

1213
01:40:31,355 --> 01:40:35,063
*  Knowing she's okay alone
and there's no messin' *

1214
01:40:37,052 --> 01:40:39,385
*  She's a lady *

1215
01:40:39,451 --> 01:40:43,411
*  Oh, oh, oh, she's a lady *

1216
01:40:43,484 --> 01:40:47,760
*  Talkin' about that little lady *

1217
01:40:47,835 --> 01:40:51,609
*  And the lady is mine *

1218
01:40:52,924 --> 01:40:55,094
*  No she never asks very much *

1219
01:40:55,164 --> 01:40:57,050
*  And I don't abuse her *

1220
01:40:57,117 --> 01:40:58,938
*  Always treat her with respect *

1221
01:40:59,004 --> 01:41:01,141
*  I never would abuse her *

1222
01:41:01,213 --> 01:41:02,738
*  What's she's got is hard to find *

1223
01:41:02,813 --> 01:41:04,699
*  And I don't want to lose her *

1224
01:41:04,765 --> 01:41:11,322
*  Help me build a mountain
from a little pile of clay *

1225
01:41:13,213 --> 01:41:14,738
*  But she's knows what I'm about *

1226
01:41:14,814 --> 01:41:16,722
*  She can take what I dish out *

1227
01:41:16,797 --> 01:41:18,618
*  And that's not easy *

1228
01:41:20,702 --> 01:41:22,555
*  But she knows me
through and through *

1229
01:41:22,622 --> 01:41:24,409
*  And she knows just what to do *

1230
01:41:24,478 --> 01:41:26,419
*  And how to please me *

1231
01:41:28,447 --> 01:41:30,813
*  She's a lady *

1232
01:41:30,879 --> 01:41:34,227
*  Oh, oh, oh, she's a lady *

1233
01:41:34,783 --> 01:41:37,749
*  Talkin' about the little lady *

1234
01:41:39,168 --> 01:41:44,023
*  And the lady is mine *

1235
01:41:44,095 --> 01:41:46,483
*  She's a lady *

1236
01:41:46,559 --> 01:41:50,170
*  Ooh, oh, oh, she's a lady *

1237
01:41:50,240 --> 01:41:54,036
*  Listen to me people, she's a lady *

1238
01:41:54,113 --> 01:41:58,105
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, she's a lady *

1239
01:41:58,177 --> 01:42:01,754
*  Oh, oh, oh, she's a lady *

1240
01:42:01,825 --> 01:42:05,719
*  Talkin' about the little lady *

1241
01:42:05,794 --> 01:42:11,063
*  Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

1242
01:42:11,137 --> 01:42:13,503
*  She's a lady *

1243
01:42:13,570 --> 01:42:17,311
*  Hey, yeah, yeah, she's a lady *

1244
01:42:17,378 --> 01:42:21,086
*  Oh, oh, oh, she's a lady *

1245
01:42:21,155 --> 01:42:24,634
*  I can't live without *
that little lady *
