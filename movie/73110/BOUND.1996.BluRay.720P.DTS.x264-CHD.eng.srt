1
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:55,155


2
00:00:57,155 --> 00:01:01,535
I had this image of you inside of me...

3
00:01:02,615 --> 00:01:04,625
like a part of me.

4
00:01:10,005 --> 00:01:11,965
You planned this whole thing.

5
00:01:12,045 --> 00:01:14,795
We make our own choice. We pay our own prices.

6
00:01:14,845 --> 00:01:17,175
Five years is a long time.

7
00:01:17,215 --> 00:01:19,185
Where's the fuckin' money?

8
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,315
All part of the business.

9
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,985
All part of the business.

10
00:01:31,075 --> 00:01:33,075
You made a choice once.

11
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,205
What choice?

12
00:01:38,165 --> 00:01:39,705
I want out.

13
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:56,815
Like a part of me.

14
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:00,695
Hold the elevator.

15
00:02:04,575 --> 00:02:05,475
Thanks.

16
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,485
Yeah, I looked over everything, sir.

17
00:03:06,565 --> 00:03:08,575
I don't think there should be any problems.

18
00:03:10,025 --> 00:03:12,985
Yes, sir, I ordered the vanity and I looked at the tub.

19
00:03:13,075 --> 00:03:15,745
I'm pretty sure we can rout it out.

20
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,705


21
00:03:19,995 --> 00:03:21,955
Yeah, I'll start everything first thing tomorrow.

22
00:03:22,045 --> 00:03:25,005


23
00:03:28,135 --> 00:03:30,635
Thanks again for this opportunity, Mr. Bianchini.

24
00:03:33,185 --> 00:03:35,105
Yeah.

25
00:03:37,145 --> 00:03:39,065


26
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:44,775


27
00:03:53,705 --> 00:03:55,625


28
00:03:59,335 --> 00:04:00,755
Hi.

29
00:04:00,845 --> 00:04:03,715
My name is Violet. We sort of met on the elevator.

30
00:04:04,925 --> 00:04:06,225
I'm Corky.

31
00:04:08,265 --> 00:04:10,725
I heard you working in here, and I was wondering...

32
00:04:10,765 --> 00:04:12,935
if you'd like a cup of coffee.

33
00:04:14,235 --> 00:04:15,355
Sure.

34
00:04:15,445 --> 00:04:16,905
Come on in.

35
00:04:16,945 --> 00:04:18,825
Just give me a second.

36
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,285
All right.

37
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:28,295
What happened to Rajiv?

38
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:32,465
He went home to India or someplace, but I think he'll be back.

39
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:35,555
So this is just a temporary situation for you?

40
00:04:35,595 --> 00:04:38,595
Yeah, pretty much. One day at a time.

41
00:04:40,055 --> 00:04:42,855
I guessed you're a straight black.

42
00:04:42,935 --> 00:04:44,315
Good guess.

43
00:04:44,395 --> 00:04:45,435
Thanks.

44
00:04:45,525 --> 00:04:46,985
My pleasure.

45
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:52,235
To be honest, I did have a slightly ulterior motive.

46
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,155
I was wondering if I might ask you a little favor.

47
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:57,245
Favor.   Yeah.

48
00:04:57,325 --> 00:04:59,915
I'm kind of a night person, and I was wondering...

49
00:04:59,955 --> 00:05:04,335
if you might wait a little bit before you start using the power tools.

50
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:07,095
Oh, sorry.   Oh, no. No.

51
00:05:07,135 --> 00:05:12,135
It's not your fault. It's just the walls here are so terribly thin.

52
00:05:13,225 --> 00:05:16,435
Really.   It's like you're in the same room.

53
00:05:16,475 --> 00:05:18,775
If it's too much trouble, I understand.

54
00:05:18,815 --> 00:05:21,775
It's no trouble at all. I got a lot to do here.

55
00:05:22,945 --> 00:05:25,445
You doin' all the work yourself?

56
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:27,325
That is so amazing.

57
00:05:27,365 --> 00:05:31,705
I am so in awe of people who can fix things.

58
00:05:31,785 --> 00:05:36,165
My dad was like that. We never had anything new.

59
00:05:36,255 --> 00:05:39,085
Whenever anything was broken, he would just...

60
00:05:39,175 --> 00:05:42,885
open it up, tinker with it a little bit...

61
00:05:42,965 --> 00:05:44,475
and fix it.

62
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:46,845
His hands were magic.

63
00:05:49,305 --> 00:05:51,565
I'll bet your car is 20 years old.

64
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:53,105
Truck.

65
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:55,105
Truck. Of course.

66
00:05:56,025 --> 00:05:58,485
'63 Chevy.   I knew it.

67
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:06,955
Well, I guess I should be going.

68
00:06:07,045 --> 00:06:09,455
You can drop the cup off at any time.

69
00:06:12,045 --> 00:06:13,335
Thanks.

70
00:06:15,345 --> 00:06:16,675
My pleasure.

71
00:06:21,305 --> 00:06:25,105


72
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:30,655
Well, well.

73
00:06:30,735 --> 00:06:32,655
It's been a long time, Cork.

74
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:36,125
Five years, two months and sixteen days.

75
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:39,625
How you doin', Sue?   Like shit.

76
00:06:39,705 --> 00:06:42,545
Now that we're all caught up, can I buy you a drink?

77
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:43,875
Thanks.

78
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:48,175
*  Friends keep tellin' me *   Welcome home.

79
00:06:48,255 --> 00:06:50,715
*  That you ain't no good *

80
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:52,885
*  But, oh, oh, they don't know *

81
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:54,975
Did you get a job yet?

82
00:06:55,055 --> 00:06:58,565
Yeah. Some plumbing, painting and shit.

83
00:06:59,605 --> 00:07:02,815
I mean a J O B. A real job.

84
00:07:05,155 --> 00:07:07,115
No. Not for me, Sue.

85
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:10,575
I'm just here to get laid.

86
00:07:11,455 --> 00:07:14,295
*  I ain't never gonna *

87
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,125
*  Love a man *

88
00:07:16,165 --> 00:07:18,085
*  The way that I *

89
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,135
*  I love you *

90
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:27,725
*  Some time ago I thought *

91
00:07:27,805 --> 00:07:31,935
*  You had run out of fools *

92
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,065
*  But I was so wrong *

93
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:37,065


94
00:07:37,155 --> 00:07:39,445
Hi.   Hello.

95
00:07:41,995 --> 00:07:43,865
Hey, Jesse, what's happenin' here?

96
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,165
Wait. I know you.

97
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:51,255
I don't think so.

98
00:07:51,335 --> 00:07:53,385
I didn't know you were out.

99
00:07:55,715 --> 00:07:59,095
When you get tired of Cagney and Lacey, find me.

100
00:07:59,185 --> 00:08:01,935
*  Don't you never never say that we're through *

101
00:08:25,755 --> 00:08:28,715


102
00:08:30,095 --> 00:08:32,055


103
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:38,605


104
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:42,485
*  Fast and slow Night and day *

105
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:44,575
*  When you stop to think *

106
00:08:44,655 --> 00:08:47,495
*  It just gets in the way *

107
00:08:47,575 --> 00:08:50,745
*  And there's not a single soul among us *

108
00:08:50,825 --> 00:08:53,165


109
00:08:55,755 --> 00:08:57,505
Yeah.

110
00:08:57,585 --> 00:08:59,045
Hey, Mr. Bianchini.

111
00:08:59,925 --> 00:09:01,465
Everything's going just fine.

112
00:09:02,635 --> 00:09:04,925
Yeah, I got the tub drain all cleaned out.

113
00:09:08,095 --> 00:09:09,515
What apartment?

114
00:09:19,575 --> 00:09:20,945
Oh, no.

115
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:24,245
Shit! I didn't know he would call you.

116
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,165
You must think I'm a total nuisance.

117
00:09:27,245 --> 00:09:28,755
Not exactly.

118
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:31,125
I'm sorry. I would usually call Rajiv...

119
00:09:31,175 --> 00:09:34,045
but I didn't know what to do, so I called Mr. Bianchini.

120
00:09:35,505 --> 00:09:38,055
He said you lost something?   Yeah.

121
00:09:38,975 --> 00:09:40,185
Come on in.

122
00:09:45,605 --> 00:09:50,815
I was doing the dishes, and just as I pulled the stopper, my earring fell in.

123
00:09:50,905 --> 00:09:54,445
That's why I got upset. It's one of my favorites.

124
00:09:57,325 --> 00:09:59,165
You got a pot or a bucket?

125
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:09,595


126
00:10:16,855 --> 00:10:19,815


127
00:10:33,335 --> 00:10:35,255
Did you find it?

128
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:42,675
Oh, my God. I can't believe that.

129
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:46,135
I can't thank you enough. You have to let me pay you something.

130
00:10:47,725 --> 00:10:49,945
No.   No ?

131
00:10:50,015 --> 00:10:53,735
Told Bianchini I'd do it. I did it.

132
00:10:53,815 --> 00:10:56,865
If you won't take money, how about a drink?

133
00:10:58,075 --> 00:11:00,035
You can't work all night.

134
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:04,785
All right.

135
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,415
One drink.

136
00:11:10,465 --> 00:11:12,545
What would you like?

137
00:11:12,585 --> 00:11:13,965
Beer.

138
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:15,425
Beer.

139
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:16,845
Of course.

140
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,775
Sit down.

141
00:11:43,835 --> 00:11:45,005
Thanks.

142
00:11:45,085 --> 00:11:47,095
You seem uncomfortable.

143
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:50,425
Do I make you nervous, Corky?

144
00:11:50,465 --> 00:11:52,095
No.

145
00:11:53,475 --> 00:11:54,685
Thirsty, maybe.

146
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,275
Curious, maybe.

147
00:11:59,355 --> 00:12:03,445
That's funny. I'm feeling a little bit curious myself.

148
00:12:05,985 --> 00:12:07,615
That's a great tattoo.

149
00:12:12,835 --> 00:12:14,745
Beautiful labris.

150
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:17,165
Are you surprised I know what it is?

151
00:12:17,215 --> 00:12:18,545
Maybe.

152
00:12:30,475 --> 00:12:31,975
I have a tattoo.

153
00:12:33,605 --> 00:12:36,025
Would you like to see it?

154
00:12:40,615 --> 00:12:43,245
A woman in upstate New York did it for me.

155
00:12:45,915 --> 00:12:47,995
Do you like it?

156
00:12:48,045 --> 00:12:50,215
Took her all day to do it.

157
00:12:52,385 --> 00:12:54,795
She promised it wouIdn't hurt, but...

158
00:12:56,005 --> 00:12:58,975
it was sore for a long time after.

159
00:13:00,435 --> 00:13:02,395
I couldn't even touch it.

160
00:13:05,105 --> 00:13:07,105
Now I love the way it feels.

161
00:13:11,115 --> 00:13:12,445
Here.

162
00:13:16,075 --> 00:13:17,575
Touch it.

163
00:13:26,755 --> 00:13:30,635
What are you doing?   Isn't it obvious?

164
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:34,225
I'm trying to seduce you.

165
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:36,935
Why?

166
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:39,065
Because I want to.

167
00:13:40,275 --> 00:13:43,905
I've wanted to ever since I saw you that day in the elevator.

168
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:52,285
I know you don't believe me...

169
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:54,375
but I can prove it to you.

170
00:14:02,005 --> 00:14:04,015
You can't believe what you'd see...

171
00:14:05,935 --> 00:14:09,815
but you can believe what you feel.

172
00:14:15,315 --> 00:14:18,905
I've been thinking about you all day.

173
00:14:21,495 --> 00:14:24,415


174
00:14:36,005 --> 00:14:37,975
You planned this whole thing.

175
00:14:39,265 --> 00:14:41,855
You dropped that earring down the sink on purpose, didn't you?

176
00:14:43,565 --> 00:14:46,145
If I say yes, will you take your hand away?

177
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:50,485
No.   Yes.

178
00:14:54,865 --> 00:14:56,865
Oh, please, Corky.

179
00:14:56,955 --> 00:14:58,455
Oh, please.

180
00:15:00,205 --> 00:15:01,625
Kiss me!

181
00:15:21,735 --> 00:15:24,195


182
00:15:30,205 --> 00:15:31,955
Oh, fuck!

183
00:15:36,045 --> 00:15:38,835
Violet! Vi, you home?

184
00:15:38,925 --> 00:15:41,005
Yeah, I'm right here, C.

185
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:47,305
What the fuck is this?   I didn't

186
00:15:47,395 --> 00:15:48,895
What the fuck is

187
00:15:50,435 --> 00:15:52,775
Oh.

188
00:15:52,855 --> 00:15:55,235
Corky, this is Caesar. Caesar, Corky.

189
00:15:55,275 --> 00:15:58,905
I thought

190
00:16:00,825 --> 00:16:02,825
It's fuckin' dark in here.

191
00:16:04,245 --> 00:16:06,745
Corky's doing some work for Mr. Bianchini.

192
00:16:08,165 --> 00:16:10,875
Oh, yeah. Right. Don mentioned that to me.

193
00:16:12,465 --> 00:16:14,295
I'm sorry. Hi.

194
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:15,925
Welcome to the family.

195
00:16:17,425 --> 00:16:20,185
So you're working with Rajiv, right?

196
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:22,605
No. Rajiv's in India.

197
00:16:22,645 --> 00:16:24,725
She's doing the work herself.

198
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:26,185
No shit.

199
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:29,315
Bianchini hired you. You must be pretty good with your hands.

200
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,775
He's a good friend of mine.   That's what Violet says.

201
00:16:31,825 --> 00:16:33,235
Family really.

202
00:16:34,325 --> 00:16:36,615
When did you get out?   Jesus, Caesar.

203
00:16:36,665 --> 00:16:39,085
What? It ain't no big fuckin' deal.

204
00:16:39,165 --> 00:16:41,455
I know who Don hires.

205
00:16:41,495 --> 00:16:45,465
You know, he did time himself. Thirteen fuckin' years.

206
00:16:46,335 --> 00:16:48,255
What did you do?

207
00:16:49,135 --> 00:16:51,305
Five.   Five.

208
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:53,845
That's not bad. What for?

209
00:16:53,895 --> 00:16:56,315
That's none of your goddamn business.

210
00:16:56,355 --> 00:16:59,025
You're right. She's right. It's none of my goddamn business.

211
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:01,605
You don't have to tell me. It's just

212
00:17:01,695 --> 00:17:03,905
I want you to understand one thing, all right?

213
00:17:04,775 --> 00:17:06,695
You're amongst good people here.

214
00:17:15,205 --> 00:17:16,755
Come on, come on.

215
00:17:17,835 --> 00:17:21,135
If you understand what I'm talkin' about, you'll take the money.

216
00:17:21,215 --> 00:17:24,635
If you don't, then I'm gonna have to worry about you.

217
00:17:28,895 --> 00:17:31,475
Good. I hate to worry.

218
00:17:32,645 --> 00:17:34,145
I got ulcers.

219
00:17:37,025 --> 00:17:38,825
I should be going.

220
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:41,705
What? No, stick around. Get her a drink.

221
00:17:41,745 --> 00:17:44,415
I gotta go clean out my brushes.

222
00:17:44,495 --> 00:17:45,915
Another time.

223
00:17:46,915 --> 00:17:49,165
Right. Another time.

224
00:18:04,975 --> 00:18:10,775
Mmm, Corky, Corky. What are you doing?

225
00:18:34,725 --> 00:18:37,435
I had to see you.

226
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:41,195
Look. I don't think this is a good idea.

227
00:18:41,275 --> 00:18:43,615
I wanted to apologize.

228
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:48,365
No, please, don't apologize.

229
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:51,705
If there's one thing I can't stand it's woman who apologize for wanting sex.

230
00:18:58,335 --> 00:19:00,675
I'm not apologizing for what I did.

231
00:19:01,755 --> 00:19:05,345
I'm apologizing for what I didn't do.

232
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,375
You have a bed somewhere?

233
00:19:56,455 --> 00:19:59,415


234
00:20:06,425 --> 00:20:08,345


235
00:20:31,325 --> 00:20:34,415


236
00:21:05,325 --> 00:21:07,045
I can see again.

237
00:21:27,145 --> 00:21:28,525
I needed that.

238
00:21:30,985 --> 00:21:33,155
So Caesar's Mafia, huh?

239
00:21:33,195 --> 00:21:35,115
You have to ask?

240
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:36,995
No.

241
00:21:37,035 --> 00:21:38,285
Funny.

242
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:40,495
Nobody really calls it that anymore.

243
00:21:40,545 --> 00:21:42,795
Caesar just calls it "the business."

244
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,215
How did you meet him?

245
00:21:45,255 --> 00:21:48,215
They took over a club I was working at.

246
00:21:48,305 --> 00:21:50,175
Caesar started managing it.

247
00:21:50,215 --> 00:21:53,345
He's a launderer?   Basically.

248
00:21:53,435 --> 00:21:55,145
How long you been with him?

249
00:21:56,265 --> 00:21:57,775
About five years.

250
00:21:59,815 --> 00:22:02,195
Five years is a long time.

251
00:22:02,235 --> 00:22:04,195
Yes, it is.

252
00:22:05,575 --> 00:22:07,655
The redistribution of wealth.

253
00:22:08,405 --> 00:22:11,325
Excuse me?   Isn't it what you wanted to know?

254
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:13,375
What I did time for?

255
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:16,545
"The redistribution of wealth?"

256
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:19,585
That's what I tell someone when I'm trying to get them in my bed.

257
00:22:19,635 --> 00:22:22,465
But I'm already in your bed.

258
00:22:25,475 --> 00:22:28,805
My cell mate would say she did her time for getting caught.

259
00:22:28,895 --> 00:22:31,645
She was always a lot more honest than me.

260
00:22:33,315 --> 00:22:36,025
You didn't have to tell me if you didn't want to.

261
00:22:36,105 --> 00:22:38,155
I guess I wanted to.

262
00:22:42,115 --> 00:22:43,825
I'm glad you did.

263
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:46,915
So am I.

264
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,265
*  Let me tell you about a girl I know *

265
00:22:57,305 --> 00:23:00,305
*  She is my baby and she lives next door *

266
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,605
*  Every mornin' before the sun comes up *

267
00:23:03,645 --> 00:23:05,935
*  She brings my coffee in my favorite cup *

268
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:09,445
*  That's why I know... *   You think I don't know that?

269
00:23:09,525 --> 00:23:11,025
Please. Come on.

270
00:23:11,115 --> 00:23:13,575
Will you just   I have to leave tonight.

271
00:23:14,995 --> 00:23:17,035
Don't make me beg, Violet.

272
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,125
Two minutes. Thank you.

273
00:23:22,255 --> 00:23:24,165


274
00:23:29,345 --> 00:23:32,885


275
00:23:32,975 --> 00:23:34,475
Hey, Violet.

276
00:23:34,555 --> 00:23:36,145
You look great.

277
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:46,535


278
00:23:49,785 --> 00:23:54,245
I had this image of you inside of me.

279
00:23:55,625 --> 00:23:57,625
Like a part of me.

280
00:24:00,345 --> 00:24:02,005
You are so beautiful.

281
00:24:05,055 --> 00:24:07,095
What's wrong?   Nothing.

282
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:13,525
Yes, there is. You didn't want to see me, did you?

283
00:24:13,565 --> 00:24:16,565
If there's one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women...

284
00:24:16,615 --> 00:24:18,615
it's all the fucking mind reading.

285
00:24:19,905 --> 00:24:22,785
I don't understand.   I know, Violet.

286
00:24:22,865 --> 00:24:25,745
That's 'cause you can't understand. We're different.

287
00:24:25,785 --> 00:24:28,085
We're not that different, Corky.

288
00:24:28,165 --> 00:24:30,965
Ah, let's see.

289
00:24:32,045 --> 00:24:33,965
This is the part where you tell me...

290
00:24:34,045 --> 00:24:36,425
what matters is on the inside...

291
00:24:36,465 --> 00:24:39,725
and that inside of you there's a little dyke just like me.

292
00:24:39,765 --> 00:24:43,815
No, she's nothing like you. She's a whole lot smarter than you are.

293
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:45,895
Is that what her daddy tells her?

294
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:50,315
I know what I am. I don't have to have it tattooed on my shoulder.

295
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:54,405
You saying you don't have sex with men?   I don't.

296
00:24:54,495 --> 00:24:56,455


297
00:24:56,495 --> 00:25:00,835
For Christ's sake, I heard you. Thin walls, remember?

298
00:25:00,915 --> 00:25:03,165
What you heard wasn't sex.

299
00:25:05,085 --> 00:25:06,505
What was it?

300
00:25:07,925 --> 00:25:09,175
Work.

301
00:25:12,055 --> 00:25:15,055
You made certain choices in your life that you paid for.

302
00:25:15,145 --> 00:25:18,815
You said you made them because you were good at something...

303
00:25:18,895 --> 00:25:20,775
and it was easy.

304
00:25:20,815 --> 00:25:23,565
You think you're the only person that's good at something?

305
00:25:25,485 --> 00:25:29,075
We make our own choices. We pay our own prices.

306
00:25:29,155 --> 00:25:31,785
I think we're more alike than you care to admit.

307
00:25:31,825 --> 00:25:34,165
What about that guy this morning?

308
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:36,295
Shelly?

309
00:25:36,335 --> 00:25:39,135
Don't tell me. You're a workaholic.

310
00:25:40,385 --> 00:25:43,965
No, Shelly knows what I am. He saw me in a bar with another woman.

311
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:49,145
Yeah. I suppose he just wants to watch.

312
00:25:49,185 --> 00:25:52,435
Fuck it. I think you'd better leave.

313
00:25:52,525 --> 00:25:54,485
Yeah, I think I'd better.

314
00:25:55,985 --> 00:25:58,485
Try not to steal anything on the way out.

315
00:27:15,795 --> 00:27:18,715
Where the fuck is it?

316
00:27:18,795 --> 00:27:21,635
I didn't do it! I swear to you!

317
00:27:23,385 --> 00:27:25,425


318
00:27:28,395 --> 00:27:29,645
Come on!

319
00:27:29,725 --> 00:27:31,645
Where is it?

320
00:27:31,725 --> 00:27:33,355
Oh, that hurt, didn't it?   Ow!

321
00:27:36,195 --> 00:27:38,405
You think you're smart?

322
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:42,495
Where's that fuckin' money?

323
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,285
Please, please!

324
00:27:44,375 --> 00:27:46,955
Please, let me go!

325
00:27:47,045 --> 00:27:48,415
Please stop it!

326
00:27:50,415 --> 00:27:53,085
Don't make me beg!

327
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:55,135
Stop it! Please!

328
00:27:57,305 --> 00:27:59,935
Please stop!   Tryin' to fuck us? You wanna fuck me?

329
00:28:00,015 --> 00:28:03,605
You piece of shit. We're goin' home.

330
00:28:04,775 --> 00:28:06,775
Nobody fucks him!   I'm not fucking him!

331
00:28:06,855 --> 00:28:08,485
I swear to God!

332
00:28:08,565 --> 00:28:10,025
Johnnie! Ho!

333
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:13,655
He's making too much noise.

334
00:28:13,695 --> 00:28:15,825
You hear that, bitch? Shut up.

335
00:28:19,705 --> 00:28:21,165
Give me a towel.

336
00:28:22,045 --> 00:28:23,665
Shut up!

337
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:25,175
Here.

338
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:28,845
Put it in his mouth.

339
00:28:42,735 --> 00:28:44,445
Caesar, I'm leaving.

340
00:28:45,575 --> 00:28:47,495
What? Why?

341
00:28:49,245 --> 00:28:51,745
I didn't use a good towel.   Caesar, I'm serious.

342
00:28:51,785 --> 00:28:54,045
I can't take this. I have to get out of here.

343
00:28:54,125 --> 00:28:55,375
Why?

344
00:28:56,665 --> 00:28:58,255
'Cause you know him?

345
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:00,925
Aw, you see?

346
00:29:02,135 --> 00:29:04,675
Baby, that's what I love about you.

347
00:29:04,765 --> 00:29:06,725
You're so fuckin' sensitive.

348
00:29:08,605 --> 00:29:11,105
But I like you here.

349
00:29:11,185 --> 00:29:13,105
I want you to stay.

350
00:29:14,195 --> 00:29:16,615
This is hard on me too.

351
00:29:16,655 --> 00:29:18,195
I like Shelly.

352
00:29:19,615 --> 00:29:23,115
So why don't you watch some TV and put on a cassette or something?

353
00:29:31,125 --> 00:29:32,465
You okay, Violet?

354
00:29:33,845 --> 00:29:36,305
Mick, why is Johnnie here?

355
00:29:36,385 --> 00:29:39,095
You know how I feel about that psycho fuck?

356
00:29:40,645 --> 00:29:42,765
Caesar, didn't I tell you to get something?

357
00:29:42,855 --> 00:29:45,395
Sure. Sorry about that.

358
00:29:49,355 --> 00:29:51,325
You shouldn't have to see this.

359
00:29:51,365 --> 00:29:53,945
Why don't you get out of here? Go for a walk.

360
00:29:54,865 --> 00:29:57,285
Caesar wants me to stay.

361
00:30:00,085 --> 00:30:03,795
Don't worry about Caesar. I'll handle Caesar.

362
00:30:05,505 --> 00:30:07,135
Get out of here.

363
00:30:07,175 --> 00:30:09,805
We can go all night, bitch.   Okay.

364
00:30:09,885 --> 00:30:11,135
Thank you, Mickey.

365
00:30:11,225 --> 00:30:13,135


366
00:30:13,185 --> 00:30:14,475
Here you go.

367
00:30:14,515 --> 00:30:17,185
All fuckin' night, baby! All night!

368
00:30:17,265 --> 00:30:21,025


369
00:30:25,075 --> 00:30:27,445
Hey, Johnnie, ease up, okay?

370
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:32,075
Bitch!

371
00:30:34,295 --> 00:30:35,795
Pick him up.

372
00:30:44,725 --> 00:30:47,685
Shelly,

373
00:30:47,765 --> 00:30:50,975
I'm gonna ask you ten times. You understand?

374
00:30:52,185 --> 00:30:53,435
Ten times.

375
00:30:53,525 --> 00:30:55,525
Yeah.

376
00:31:10,215 --> 00:31:12,335
One. Where's our money?

377
00:31:12,425 --> 00:31:14,965


378
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,095


379
00:31:20,765 --> 00:31:22,685


380
00:31:34,285 --> 00:31:35,905
You all right?

381
00:31:49,135 --> 00:31:51,595
Come on. Let's get out of here.

382
00:31:54,645 --> 00:31:57,225
Keep it.

383
00:32:15,045 --> 00:32:17,045
Shelly was skimming from the business.

384
00:32:18,795 --> 00:32:23,425
He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar found out.

385
00:32:23,515 --> 00:32:26,225
He wanted to run, but he wanted me to come with him.

386
00:32:26,305 --> 00:32:28,515
Even though he knew about you.

387
00:32:28,605 --> 00:32:31,525
Yeah.   This guy's in love with you?

388
00:32:31,605 --> 00:32:35,605
That's what he tells himself, but it's not even about me.

389
00:32:35,695 --> 00:32:39,535
He could have run at any time, but he didn't want out.

390
00:32:39,615 --> 00:32:41,615
It sounds like he wanted to get caught.

391
00:32:41,705 --> 00:32:43,955
Yeah. Maybe he did.

392
00:32:44,035 --> 00:32:47,045
He would brag to me all the time.

393
00:32:47,125 --> 00:32:50,415
He was never afraid of Caesar because...

394
00:32:50,505 --> 00:32:52,085
he didn't know him.

395
00:32:52,175 --> 00:32:53,505
Not like I do.

396
00:32:55,255 --> 00:32:57,635
I used to be able to block it out.

397
00:32:59,015 --> 00:33:01,185
Or I'd just tell myself that...

398
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:04,855
I wasn't really there, and so...

399
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:08,275
none of it really mattered.

400
00:33:09,735 --> 00:33:12,155
But I can't do that anymore.

401
00:33:14,325 --> 00:33:17,245
I'm making the same mistake Shelly made...

402
00:33:18,325 --> 00:33:21,375
but now I know what I want.

403
00:33:25,925 --> 00:33:27,545
I want out.

404
00:33:30,175 --> 00:33:32,225
I want a new life.

405
00:33:34,975 --> 00:33:38,025
I see what I've been waiting for, but I can't do it alone.

406
00:33:44,945 --> 00:33:47,445
I need your help, Corky.

407
00:33:52,075 --> 00:33:55,585
Caesar's gonna get the money     How much money?

408
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:57,875
Shelly said it's over two million dollars.

409
00:34:01,095 --> 00:34:04,095
Yeah. So Caesar's gonna get it.

410
00:34:04,175 --> 00:34:07,395
He's gonna bring it by the apartment. He's gonna count it.

411
00:34:07,475 --> 00:34:10,395
He's gonna go through the books and try and figure out how Shelly did it.

412
00:34:10,475 --> 00:34:13,275
Wait a minute. Violet, do you know what you're saying?

413
00:34:13,315 --> 00:34:15,905
You're asking me to help you fuck over the Mob.

414
00:34:17,235 --> 00:34:19,365
Violet, these people are serious.

415
00:34:19,445 --> 00:34:22,155
You wanna know how serious? Ask your friend Shelly.

416
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:25,955
They're worse than any cop because they have lots of money and no rules.

417
00:34:26,035 --> 00:34:28,085
You fuck them, you better do it right.

418
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:31,215
That's why I need your help. You said you were good.

419
00:34:31,295 --> 00:34:32,755
I am good.

420
00:34:35,845 --> 00:34:39,685
Let's just say for a moment I believe everything you're saying.

421
00:34:39,765 --> 00:34:42,265
You think I'm lying?   I didn't say that.

422
00:34:43,765 --> 00:34:46,775
But since you did, let's say you are.

423
00:34:46,855 --> 00:34:49,445
It would have been easy for you to set up Shelly.

424
00:34:49,525 --> 00:34:51,155
You could have had him killed...

425
00:34:51,235 --> 00:34:53,405
knowing that Caesar would bring the money back to the apartment.

426
00:34:55,075 --> 00:34:58,245
All you would need to keep yourself clean is someone unconnected.

427
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:01,125
Someone like me.

428
00:35:02,915 --> 00:35:05,005
Is that what you think?

429
00:35:05,085 --> 00:35:07,095
I'm just making a point.

430
00:35:09,805 --> 00:35:11,975
You have no idea what you're asking...

431
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:17,185
how much trust it takes two people to do something like this.

432
00:35:20,485 --> 00:35:22,945
For me, stealing has always been a lot like sex.

433
00:35:24,195 --> 00:35:26,695
Two people who want the same thing.

434
00:35:26,735 --> 00:35:29,285
They get in a room, they talk about it.

435
00:35:30,615 --> 00:35:32,955
They start to plan. It's like flirting.

436
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:37,165
It's kind of like foreplay.

437
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:40,595
Because the more they talk about it, the wetter they get.

438
00:35:44,055 --> 00:35:46,635
The only difference is, I can fuck someone I've just met.

439
00:35:48,475 --> 00:35:52,145
But to steal, I need to know someone like I know myself.

440
00:35:53,855 --> 00:35:55,855
You think you know me like that?

441
00:35:57,615 --> 00:35:59,575
I wanna see the money.

442
00:36:02,745 --> 00:36:04,285
Oh, my God!

443
00:36:04,375 --> 00:36:06,415
Don't worry. It ain't mine.

444
00:36:15,135 --> 00:36:17,765
Caesar, what happened?   It was unbelievable, Vi.

445
00:36:17,805 --> 00:36:19,885
Un fuckin' believable!

446
00:36:20,895 --> 00:36:22,935
Shit! Look at this shirt.

447
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,065
Look at it. It's ruined.

448
00:36:25,145 --> 00:36:27,695
It all started when Shelly took us to the money.

449
00:36:27,775 --> 00:36:30,565
I'll tell you something. Mickey, he knows his shit.

450
00:36:30,655 --> 00:36:32,615
He does. Shelly took us right there.

451
00:36:32,695 --> 00:36:35,325
So Shelly's down on his knees, right...

452
00:36:35,405 --> 00:36:38,785
and he's pulling out this money from a safe on the floor...

453
00:36:38,825 --> 00:36:40,375
and I'm standin' there...

454
00:36:40,455 --> 00:36:42,545
and I'm lookin' at it, right?

455
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:44,795
Like, "Holy fuck!"

456
00:36:44,875 --> 00:36:50,345
All I can think about is, "How the fuck was he able to do this," when bang!

457
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:53,515
Johnny caps him. He caps Shelly!

458
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:56,765
Blood goes flyin' everywhere. All over me. All over the money.

459
00:36:56,855 --> 00:36:59,985
I have no idea if this is even all of it.

460
00:37:02,025 --> 00:37:05,365
And right then, I go through the roof and bam!

461
00:37:05,445 --> 00:37:07,365
I punch the dumb son of a bitch.

462
00:37:07,445 --> 00:37:09,915
I punch him right in his dumb fuckin' face.

463
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:11,995
I didn't give a shit whose son he was.

464
00:37:12,035 --> 00:37:16,335
I just wanted to hit him again   smack some sense into the dumb son of a bitch!

465
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:19,505
Look at the shit that I gotta fuckin' deal with now!

466
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:22,715
What are you gonna do with it?   I told him to run it through the cycle.

467
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:25,935
But no, Johnnie calls up the old man, and I guess he's got other plans...

468
00:37:26,015 --> 00:37:28,935
because he wants to pick up this shit tomorrow night.

469
00:37:33,645 --> 00:37:35,525
Where's the laundry detergent?

470
00:37:35,565 --> 00:37:37,575
It's in the linen cabinet.

471
00:37:44,745 --> 00:37:47,705


472
00:37:57,425 --> 00:38:00,435
Come to my place in the morning, early.

473
00:38:02,765 --> 00:38:05,525
You think you know me like that?

474
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:10,485
Two million dollars.

475
00:38:13,115 --> 00:38:15,075
You're having second thoughts.

476
00:38:15,155 --> 00:38:17,625
No.

477
00:38:17,665 --> 00:38:19,625
You said Caesar washed the money?

478
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:22,875
Yeah.   Then what? Exactly.

479
00:38:22,965 --> 00:38:25,885
He hung it up.   He what?

480
00:38:25,965 --> 00:38:27,885
To let it dry.

481
00:38:31,015 --> 00:38:32,475
It was unreal.

482
00:38:40,485 --> 00:38:43,485
Hundreds paper clipped everywhere like leaves.

483
00:38:43,565 --> 00:38:45,485


484
00:38:51,075 --> 00:38:54,495
Then one by one he ironed all of it.

485
00:38:59,585 --> 00:39:01,505


486
00:39:01,595 --> 00:39:04,305
Did he sleep?   No, but neither did I.

487
00:39:09,815 --> 00:39:12,565
All night long I listened to that sound.

488
00:39:12,645 --> 00:39:15,445
What sound?   The sound of money.

489
00:39:16,445 --> 00:39:18,365


490
00:39:21,705 --> 00:39:23,075
Where is it now?

491
00:39:24,165 --> 00:39:25,835
It's in his office.

492
00:39:25,875 --> 00:39:27,875
I saw it this morning.

493
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:35,005
I need to go to the store.

494
00:39:39,095 --> 00:39:41,515
It's in a case on his desk.

495
00:39:41,555 --> 00:39:43,685
Does the case lock?

496
00:39:43,725 --> 00:39:45,065
Yes.

497
00:39:46,185 --> 00:39:50,865
Huh. Tell me about Johnnie.   Johnnie?

498
00:39:50,905 --> 00:39:52,905
Sounds like he and Caesar don't like each other.

499
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:54,905
Like each other? They hate each other.

500
00:39:54,995 --> 00:39:56,785
Why?   I don't know.

501
00:39:56,865 --> 00:39:58,955
Happened long before I came around.

502
00:39:59,035 --> 00:40:02,665
I think it's basically Caesar thinks Johnnie's a complete idiot...

503
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:05,335
but, you know, what can you do?

504
00:40:05,425 --> 00:40:08,045
Johnnie runs Chicago 'cause Gino's his father.

505
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,215
Who's Gino?

506
00:40:11,095 --> 00:40:12,635
Gino Marzzone.

507
00:40:14,095 --> 00:40:18,145
Marzzone, as in Angelo Marzzone, head of the Marzzone family?

508
00:40:18,225 --> 00:40:20,235
Yeah, that's his brother.

509
00:40:22,355 --> 00:40:23,815
Shit.

510
00:40:24,945 --> 00:40:27,495
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place tonight to pick up the money?

511
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:29,245
Yeah.

512
00:40:29,325 --> 00:40:31,875
And Johnnie Marzzone's his son? That's Johnnie?

513
00:40:31,955 --> 00:40:33,375
Yeah.

514
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:38,255
Sweet Jesus.

515
00:40:45,055 --> 00:40:46,515
It's perfect.

516
00:40:46,595 --> 00:40:49,435
Gino Marzzone's coming to your place tonight. This is a big deal.

517
00:40:49,475 --> 00:40:52,525
Caesar's gonna want to do it right. He won't want to look like an idiot.

518
00:40:52,605 --> 00:40:55,155
Has Gino been to your place before?   Yeah, twice.

519
00:40:55,235 --> 00:40:58,195
What happened?   Caesar was really nervous.

520
00:40:58,275 --> 00:41:00,445
He kept cleaning the apartment.

521
00:41:00,535 --> 00:41:03,745
The first time he picked out the dress he wanted me to wear.

522
00:41:03,825 --> 00:41:05,745
Did Johnnie ever hit on you?

523
00:41:05,835 --> 00:41:09,165
Johnnie hits on me all the time. He hits on anything in high heels.

524
00:41:09,255 --> 00:41:13,335
Did Caesar ever see this?   He does it right in front of him.

525
00:41:13,425 --> 00:41:16,095
This is getting better and better. Go on.

526
00:41:16,175 --> 00:41:20,185
Well, Gino doesn't speak much English, or at least he pretends not to...

527
00:41:20,265 --> 00:41:22,475
so he usually gets right to the point.

528
00:41:22,515 --> 00:41:25,315
Both times they only talked for about five minutes.

529
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:27,565
They had a drink and then they left.

530
00:41:27,645 --> 00:41:29,775
What did Gino drink?   Scotch.

531
00:41:29,865 --> 00:41:34,495
Glenlivet. I remember that 'cause Caesar made a big deal about it.

532
00:41:37,165 --> 00:41:38,995
All right.

533
00:41:45,965 --> 00:41:48,005
I have an idea how to make this work.

534
00:41:49,555 --> 00:41:52,345
Go back and get ready. Take your time. Make it real.

535
00:41:53,475 --> 00:41:56,015
What time did you say they'd be there?

536
00:41:56,055 --> 00:42:00,025
The plane gets in at 7:00, so I'd say around 8:00.

537
00:42:00,065 --> 00:42:02,445
All right.

538
00:42:02,525 --> 00:42:04,945
Now, at some point, Caesar's gonna quit.

539
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:09,365
I guess sometime around 6:00, making sure he's got time to get ready.

540
00:42:09,405 --> 00:42:14,085
As soon as he's done, you'll be there to put a big drink in his hand.

541
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:17,125
Unbelievable what this guy Shelly did.

542
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:19,795
I'll tell you, Shelly's one smart ass motherfucker.

543
00:42:19,885 --> 00:42:24,055
I mean, he was one smart ass motherfucker.

544
00:42:24,095 --> 00:42:27,225
Poor boy. Has to work so hard.

545
00:42:30,435 --> 00:42:32,395


546
00:42:32,435 --> 00:42:35,195
You want him to relax, unwind.

547
00:42:36,615 --> 00:42:38,735
You look good enough to eat.

548
00:42:39,945 --> 00:42:41,745
Where will you be?

549
00:42:41,785 --> 00:42:44,075
I'll be waiting in the apartment next door.

550
00:42:44,165 --> 00:42:47,455
Waiting for what?   For the shower.

551
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:49,455
That's gonna be our signal.

552
00:42:50,415 --> 00:42:53,335
When he's done with his shower, you'll go to the bar.

553
00:42:54,795 --> 00:42:57,345
You'll get out the scotch that Gino drinks.

554
00:42:57,425 --> 00:43:00,645
As you do, the bottle will slip from your hands.

555
00:43:01,935 --> 00:43:03,265
An accident.

556
00:43:05,525 --> 00:43:07,695
Vi, what the hell was that?

557
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,405
Vi, you can't hear me?

558
00:43:10,485 --> 00:43:12,485
Ah, fuck!   Caesar, it slipped.

559
00:43:12,575 --> 00:43:15,615
I was trying to get ready.   How the fuck did you do that?

560
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:18,165
Caesar, it was an accident. I didn't mean to.

561
00:43:18,245 --> 00:43:20,955
I'll get some more.   There's no fuckin' time!

562
00:43:21,045 --> 00:43:23,045
Don't be silly. There's lots of time.

563
00:43:23,125 --> 00:43:25,925
I'll clean this up and I'll be back before you're even dressed.

564
00:43:26,005 --> 00:43:27,595
Fuck, Vi!

565
00:43:34,265 --> 00:43:36,815
When you open the door, I'll be there.

566
00:43:41,605 --> 00:43:43,365
What if he sees you?

567
00:43:43,445 --> 00:43:45,115
He won't.

568
00:43:45,195 --> 00:43:48,115
You can't know for certain that he won't see you.

569
00:43:49,575 --> 00:43:52,625
Trust me.   I'm just asking. What if?

570
00:43:53,545 --> 00:43:55,165
If he does...

571
00:43:56,875 --> 00:43:58,925
then I won't have a choice, will I?

572
00:44:02,385 --> 00:44:04,725
When I'm inside, I'll get the money.

573
00:44:46,855 --> 00:44:49,405
I'm gonna need something to fill the case.

574
00:44:49,485 --> 00:44:51,445
Hide it near the desk.

575
00:44:52,485 --> 00:44:53,865
And at that point...

576
00:44:56,785 --> 00:44:58,745
there's no turning back.

577
00:45:10,845 --> 00:45:12,595
When I get the scotch...

578
00:45:13,805 --> 00:45:15,765
how do I know you won't just take off?

579
00:45:16,815 --> 00:45:20,235
The same way I'll know that you went to go get the scotch.

580
00:45:20,315 --> 00:45:21,355
Trust.

581
00:45:21,445 --> 00:45:23,615
I still don't see how I'm gonna get away clean...

582
00:45:23,655 --> 00:45:25,615
with all the money in the apartment.

583
00:45:25,655 --> 00:45:27,905
Everyone's gonna think I took it.

584
00:45:27,995 --> 00:45:29,325
Not Caesar.   Why?

585
00:45:29,405 --> 00:45:31,625
'Cause of what you're gonna tell him.

586
00:45:31,665 --> 00:45:33,745
You gotta be as real as you can.

587
00:45:34,585 --> 00:45:37,505
The moment you walk through that door with the scotch...

588
00:45:37,545 --> 00:45:38,965
you'll be covered.

589
00:45:40,175 --> 00:45:43,425
That moment's the most important moment of the plan.

590
00:45:43,515 --> 00:45:47,145
'Cause if you're real enough, he's gonna believe you, 'cause deep down...

591
00:45:47,185 --> 00:45:48,435
he'll want to.

592
00:45:48,515 --> 00:45:51,775
C? Shit, I'm sorry. They were early.

593
00:45:52,855 --> 00:45:55,945
What are you talkin' about?   They just left, didn't they?

594
00:45:56,025 --> 00:45:58,945
What, are you drunk?   They weren't just up here?

595
00:45:59,035 --> 00:46:01,445
No, they're still on their way.

596
00:46:01,535 --> 00:46:03,165
That doesn't make any sense.

597
00:46:04,785 --> 00:46:07,995
Why?   I just saw Johnnie downstairs.

598
00:46:10,755 --> 00:46:11,835
What?

599
00:46:11,925 --> 00:46:15,425
Yeah. I was getting out of my car, and I saw him in his BMW.

600
00:46:17,555 --> 00:46:19,935
Nah, it couldn't have been.   It was him, Caesar.

601
00:46:20,015 --> 00:46:21,345
I'm positive.

602
00:46:23,565 --> 00:46:24,775
Vi, that's impossible.

603
00:46:24,855 --> 00:46:27,775
Caesar, I know Johnnie.

604
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:29,355
It was him.

605
00:46:29,445 --> 00:46:32,155
I screamed when I saw him. I couldn't believe I missed him.

606
00:46:32,235 --> 00:46:35,495
I knew you were gonna be upset, so I thought I'd stop and apologize...

607
00:46:35,575 --> 00:46:37,745
and give Gino the scotch, but...

608
00:46:37,825 --> 00:46:41,045
I honked a couple of times, and Johnnie didn't even hear me. He didn't stop.

609
00:46:44,175 --> 00:46:45,505
But...

610
00:46:46,635 --> 00:46:48,885
Gino's plane doesn't get here for another half hour.

611
00:46:53,225 --> 00:46:55,305
Actually, I didn't see Gino in the car.

612
00:47:06,945 --> 00:47:10,875
If Caesar hates Johnnie as much as you say, when he opens that case...

613
00:47:10,955 --> 00:47:14,585
he's gonna know in his gut that Johnnie just fucked him.

614
00:47:14,625 --> 00:47:18,505
He'll have no choice. He can't go after Gino or Johnnie.

615
00:47:18,585 --> 00:47:20,595
There's only one way out.

616
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:22,845
He'll have to run.

617
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:26,595
And if he runs...

618
00:47:26,635 --> 00:47:29,395
everyone will assume he took the money.

619
00:47:29,475 --> 00:47:32,395
You'll be clean, and we'll be rich.

620
00:47:32,485 --> 00:47:34,855
Jesus, that's beautiful.

621
00:47:36,485 --> 00:47:40,195
If you're this goddamn smart, how did you ever get caught?

622
00:47:41,115 --> 00:47:43,325
I had a partner once.

623
00:47:43,415 --> 00:47:44,955
She fucked me.

624
00:47:47,375 --> 00:47:48,835
I won't.

625
00:47:51,965 --> 00:47:53,795
I think we're gonna find out.

626
00:47:58,385 --> 00:48:00,515
Oh, God!   Caesar?

627
00:48:02,975 --> 00:48:04,895
No.

628
00:48:05,645 --> 00:48:07,565
C?

629
00:48:09,235 --> 00:48:10,485
Oh, no.

630
00:48:12,485 --> 00:48:13,495
Oh, God.

631
00:48:14,695 --> 00:48:17,575


632
00:48:17,665 --> 00:48:20,035
Vi.

633
00:48:20,125 --> 00:48:21,795
Vi, I've been set up.

634
00:48:21,875 --> 00:48:23,375
Johnnie?

635
00:48:23,465 --> 00:48:24,965
That fuck!

636
00:48:25,755 --> 00:48:28,215
That rat fuck!

637
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:31,095
That motherless rat fuck!

638
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:34,595
Why? Why would Johnnie do this?

639
00:48:38,525 --> 00:48:42,195
Jesus Christ. Violet, open your fucking eyes.

640
00:48:42,275 --> 00:48:44,525
Johnnie hates me as much as I hate him.

641
00:48:46,075 --> 00:48:48,035
I hate that motherless rat fuck.

642
00:48:48,075 --> 00:48:51,205
I fuckin' hate him.   But you know he did it.

643
00:48:52,075 --> 00:48:55,045
Yeah. So what? So fucking what?

644
00:48:56,375 --> 00:49:00,045
Look, the money is gone, right?

645
00:49:00,085 --> 00:49:01,885
Gino's coming to get it.

646
00:49:01,965 --> 00:49:05,225
Do you think Gino is going to believe me when I tell him...

647
00:49:05,305 --> 00:49:08,265
his little rat fuck son stole it?

648
00:49:08,305 --> 00:49:11,105
'Cause I don't. You know what I think?

649
00:49:11,185 --> 00:49:13,895
I'm a dead man. I'm one in the back of the head.

650
00:49:13,985 --> 00:49:15,525
That's what I think.

651
00:49:17,445 --> 00:49:18,865
What are we gonna do?

652
00:49:19,945 --> 00:49:22,865
I know what Johnnie wants me to do. Johnnie wants me to run.

653
00:49:22,955 --> 00:49:24,875
He wants me outta here.

654
00:49:24,955 --> 00:49:27,915
But if I run, then everybody thinks I fucking did it...

655
00:49:27,995 --> 00:49:30,005
and he gets away with two million clean.

656
00:49:31,965 --> 00:49:34,175
I can see him right now...

657
00:49:34,255 --> 00:49:36,305
on the way to get Gino, laughin' at me!

658
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:38,265
Laughin' at me, laughin' at me !

659
00:49:38,305 --> 00:49:40,015
Laughin' at me!

660
00:49:40,095 --> 00:49:42,105
Fuckin' laughin' at me!

661
00:49:44,105 --> 00:49:47,275
Don't! Please. Don't touch me, okay?

662
00:49:47,355 --> 00:49:50,065
I gotta think. I gotta fuckin' think this through!

663
00:49:51,695 --> 00:49:54,115
Caesar, I think we should run.

664
00:49:54,155 --> 00:49:56,915
We have to go now, before it's too late!

665
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:59,455
Please, Violet, leave me alone.

666
00:49:59,495 --> 00:50:00,995
Please, all right?

667
00:50:01,085 --> 00:50:03,255
Just leave me the fuck alone!

668
00:50:07,005 --> 00:50:08,305
All right, Caesar.

669
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:13,345
I gotta think, that's all. I just gotta think.

670
00:50:35,505 --> 00:50:38,425


671
00:50:38,505 --> 00:50:40,505
It's me.   What happened?

672
00:50:40,545 --> 00:50:44,015
He totally freaked out. I've never seen him like this.

673
00:50:44,055 --> 00:50:45,845
He's out of his fucking mind.

674
00:50:45,885 --> 00:50:48,765
That's all right, as long as he believes it was Johnnie.

675
00:50:48,855 --> 00:50:51,435
Believes it? Jesus!

676
00:50:51,525 --> 00:50:54,525
It's driving him crazy. He wants to kill him.

677
00:50:55,735 --> 00:50:57,695
I don't know, Corky.

678
00:50:57,775 --> 00:51:01,365
I'm getting really nervous. I don't know what he's gonna do.

679
00:51:01,405 --> 00:51:04,325
It's all right, Violet. It's working.

680
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:07,085
All we gotta do is wait him out and see what he does.

681
00:51:07,165 --> 00:51:09,165
What if he doesn't run?

682
00:51:10,755 --> 00:51:12,835
That means he'll probably kill Johnnie.

683
00:51:12,925 --> 00:51:14,885
Oh, Christ! I have to get out of here!

684
00:51:14,965 --> 00:51:19,765
Listen, if he doesn't run, all you gotta do is break down.

685
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:22,305
Go into the bedroom and pack some things.

686
00:51:22,395 --> 00:51:25,315
Start crying. Tell him you love him, but you can't take it.

687
00:51:25,395 --> 00:51:29,025
You're sorry, but you gotta Ieave, and just waIk out.

688
00:51:29,105 --> 00:51:31,195
All right. Okay.

689
00:51:31,275 --> 00:51:34,325
We're almost there. Just hang on.

690
00:51:34,405 --> 00:51:35,535
He's coming!

691
00:51:38,125 --> 00:51:41,415
I know what I have to do. I have to get the money back.

692
00:51:41,455 --> 00:51:44,295
The money? The money's gone.

693
00:51:44,375 --> 00:51:47,715
No, Johnnie's got it. I gotta get it back.

694
00:51:48,635 --> 00:51:50,055
It could be anywhere.

695
00:51:50,135 --> 00:51:52,135
There's not enough time, Violet.

696
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:54,305
Johnnie's gotta pick up Gino at the airport, right?

697
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:58,395
That means he's probably got the money with him in the car.

698
00:51:58,475 --> 00:51:59,935
Did he see you?

699
00:51:59,985 --> 00:52:02,525
No.

700
00:52:02,605 --> 00:52:04,985
Good. That's good.

701
00:52:09,075 --> 00:52:11,245
That means I got the edge.

702
00:52:11,325 --> 00:52:13,285
He doesn't know I know.

703
00:52:16,755 --> 00:52:18,835
That's why he put the paper in the case.

704
00:52:20,295 --> 00:52:22,305
He wants me to hand it to Gino.

705
00:52:24,175 --> 00:52:26,185
Then there's no doubt I did it.

706
00:52:27,645 --> 00:52:29,565
Gino will put a bullet in me himself.

707
00:52:32,145 --> 00:52:34,145
But that's not gonna happen.

708
00:52:37,985 --> 00:52:41,155
That jack off's not gonna set me up. No way. Not like this.

709
00:52:42,865 --> 00:52:44,245
This is insane.

710
00:52:49,375 --> 00:52:50,925
What are you doin'?

711
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,505
I'm leaving.

712
00:52:53,545 --> 00:52:57,135
I don't want any part of this shit. I don't want to be involved.

713
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:59,475
You can't leave.   The hell I can't.

714
00:53:02,225 --> 00:53:05,025
I need you.   You don't need me.

715
00:53:05,065 --> 00:53:07,025
You've never needed me.

716
00:53:07,065 --> 00:53:09,195
I can't help you, understand?

717
00:53:17,955 --> 00:53:19,955
I can't let you leave.

718
00:53:21,085 --> 00:53:24,585
If you're not with me, I have to assume you're against me.

719
00:53:26,085 --> 00:53:28,005
Caesar, this is crazy.

720
00:53:28,095 --> 00:53:31,265
Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't.

721
00:53:32,635 --> 00:53:35,055
Maybe you dropped that bottle of scotch by accident.

722
00:53:35,105 --> 00:53:36,395
Maybe you didn't.

723
00:53:37,435 --> 00:53:40,485
I would've been so easy...

724
00:53:40,565 --> 00:53:42,605
to let him in as you left.

725
00:53:44,195 --> 00:53:45,735
You can't believe that.

726
00:53:45,785 --> 00:53:47,905
I've seen the way he looks at you.

727
00:53:48,825 --> 00:53:50,825
He's always wanted you.

728
00:53:51,915 --> 00:53:53,795
Maybe two million bucks finally bought you.

729
00:54:03,635 --> 00:54:05,095
I'm sorry, Violet.

730
00:54:09,305 --> 00:54:10,725
I wanna trust you.

731
00:54:11,815 --> 00:54:13,395
But you understand.

732
00:54:21,655 --> 00:54:23,615
I don't have any other choice.

733
00:54:42,355 --> 00:54:44,105
You sure you don't want a drink?

734
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:52,945


735
00:55:05,295 --> 00:55:07,505


736
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,805
Hello.   Yeah, we're here.

737
00:55:11,885 --> 00:55:13,805
Hey, Johnnie.   Open the fuckin' door.

738
00:55:13,895 --> 00:55:15,305
Sure. Come on up.

739
00:55:52,645 --> 00:55:53,895
Gino.

740
00:55:56,405 --> 00:55:59,285
Good to see you. Vi, look who's here.

741
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:01,325
Hello, Gino. How are you?

742
00:56:01,405 --> 00:56:03,825


743
00:56:08,955 --> 00:56:11,715
You shouldn't have hit me.   You wanna get into this now?

744
00:56:11,795 --> 00:56:13,385
No, Caesar, not now.

745
00:56:14,635 --> 00:56:16,595


746
00:56:22,605 --> 00:56:25,065
You are as radiant as ever, Violet.

747
00:56:40,585 --> 00:56:43,415
Gino, Glenlivet, right?

748
00:56:43,505 --> 00:56:44,625


749
00:56:44,675 --> 00:56:47,595
And I'll have whatever Violet's drinking.

750
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:50,345
I'm not drinking.   Oh, well, then neither will I.

751
00:56:52,185 --> 00:56:54,395
No, I'll have a Tanqueray and tonic.

752
00:56:55,855 --> 00:56:57,855
Caesar, two T&T's.

753
00:57:16,585 --> 00:57:20,505
Salud, eh? Roy, Pop, Violet.

754
00:57:20,545 --> 00:57:21,885
Caesar.

755
00:57:23,965 --> 00:57:25,935
Uh uh, no, no, Johnnie.

756
00:57:26,015 --> 00:57:28,355
I gotta make a bet.   No goddamn phone. Not now.

757
00:57:30,225 --> 00:57:33,315
Cesare, come and sit. We're gonna talk now.

758
00:57:33,395 --> 00:57:36,315
Johnnie, you too. No, no.

759
00:57:39,825 --> 00:57:41,245
Cesare, look at me.

760
00:57:43,115 --> 00:57:45,205
Johnnie, he said to me what happened.

761
00:57:47,245 --> 00:57:51,965
Cesare, you gotta do me a favor. A personal favor for me, huh?

762
00:57:53,045 --> 00:57:56,425
You gotta start respecting Johnnie the way you respect me.

763
00:57:58,595 --> 00:58:01,555
Good, good.

764
00:58:03,015 --> 00:58:06,435
And you, Johnnie, you gotta stop acting stupid.

765
00:58:07,945 --> 00:58:10,365
You gotta earn this respect that Cesare's gonna give.

766
00:58:11,985 --> 00:58:13,945


767
00:58:14,785 --> 00:58:16,075
Good!

768
00:58:16,115 --> 00:58:17,455
Done!

769
00:58:20,295 --> 00:58:21,585
Now...

770
00:58:23,965 --> 00:58:25,585
where's my money?

771
00:58:35,305 --> 00:58:37,105
We know how this was done?

772
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,065
Yeah. I know.

773
00:58:41,905 --> 00:58:44,155
And it won't happen again?

774
00:58:45,825 --> 00:58:47,905
Good. Done. We go now.

775
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:49,955
Wait a minute, Pop. Jesus Christ.

776
00:58:50,035 --> 00:58:53,245
You got two hours till your plane leaves.

777
00:58:53,335 --> 00:58:55,125


778
00:58:55,205 --> 00:58:56,915
Just relax. Have a drink.

779
00:58:57,005 --> 00:59:00,545
Caesare, Glenlivet

780
00:59:07,400 --> 00:59:09,530
So, Caesar, tell me something.

781
00:59:09,610 --> 00:59:11,650
What did it total out at?

782
00:59:12,780 --> 00:59:14,240
2.176. 2.176.\n2.176.

783
00:59:14,330 --> 00:59:16,540
Unbelievable.

784
00:59:17,410 --> 00:59:19,000
Can you believe that, Violet?

785
00:59:19,080 --> 00:59:21,210
Johnnie.

786
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:23,250
I just wanna know one thing.

787
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:27,380
Just one thing after he made such a big deal about it.

788
00:59:28,510 --> 00:59:30,760
I'll bet it wasn't such a big deal, huh, Caesar?

789
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:34,600
What's that, Johnnie?

790
00:59:35,400 --> 00:59:37,270
The money.

791
00:59:37,360 --> 00:59:39,320
I'll bet it wasn't nothin' to make it clean...

792
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:41,700
after you made such a big fuckin' deal about it.

793
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:43,780
What I tell you     It's important to me, Pop.

794
00:59:43,870 --> 00:59:46,980
It's a simple question. If he'd answer it, that's the end of it.

795
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:53,280
Where's this goin', Johnnie?

796
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:57,210
Just admit it.

797
00:59:59,290 --> 01:00:00,710
Admit what?

798
01:00:00,790 --> 01:00:03,210
That you overreacted!

799
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:06,340
You lost it! Not me.

800
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,470
It was your mistake.

801
01:00:10,560 --> 01:00:13,850
You wanna play it this way?

802
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:15,980
I could play it this way.

803
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,240
You wanna know who made a mistake?

804
01:00:22,070 --> 01:00:23,530
Open the case.

805
01:00:23,580 --> 01:00:25,580
Caesar.   Shut up, Violet.

806
01:00:25,620 --> 01:00:27,540
This is between me and Johnnie.

807
01:00:30,840 --> 01:00:32,550
You wanna do this now?

808
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,180
Let's do it.

809
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:42,310
Open the fuckin' case.

810
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:50,110
Open the case.

811
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:00,580
Where's the fucking key?

812
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:02,130
You don't need a key.

813
01:01:02,210 --> 01:01:04,380
Then how the fuck can I open it?

814
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:07,970
The same way you did before.

815
01:01:08,010 --> 01:01:10,640
What are you talking about?

816
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,060


817
01:01:13,140 --> 01:01:15,050
All right, Johnnie.

818
01:01:20,980 --> 01:01:22,440
Violet...

819
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:25,730
get me another drink.

820
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:47,140
What is this?   Don't you fucking move!

821
01:01:47,220 --> 01:01:49,680
Where is it, fuckface?

822
01:01:49,770 --> 01:01:51,600
Where's what?   The money!

823
01:01:51,680 --> 01:01:55,690
Okay, Caesar, if you don't put down that gun

824
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:57,440
Sit down.

825
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:01,620
Caesar, what is this?

826
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:04,450
Gino, your son stole this money to set me up!

827
01:02:04,540 --> 01:02:07,290
He fuckin' stole it, and I can prove it!

828
01:02:07,370 --> 01:02:09,670
Violet, tell them.

829
01:02:09,710 --> 01:02:11,500
Tell them!

830
01:02:11,590 --> 01:02:14,170
For God's sake, Johnnie, do what he says.

831
01:02:14,260 --> 01:02:18,050
For Christ's sake! This isn't happening.

832
01:02:20,810 --> 01:02:22,810
Next one blows off your fuckin' dick!

833
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:26,650
I'm looking at a dead man. You're a fuckin' dead man!

834
01:02:26,730 --> 01:02:28,650
Enough!

835
01:02:28,740 --> 01:02:31,990
Gino, don't.   Do you point the gun at me?

836
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:37,500
Do you know who I am? I am Gino Marzzone!

837
01:02:37,580 --> 01:02:41,380


838
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:43,420
No, Gino, please.

839
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,870


840
01:02:44,910 --> 01:02:47,290
Gino, sit down.

841
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,840
We're family, Cesare.

842
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:53,930
Family, Caesar.

843
01:02:54,010 --> 01:02:55,510
Family.

844
01:02:56,850 --> 01:02:58,270
Now...

845
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:01,940
give it to me.

846
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,200
Good man.

847
01:03:28,560 --> 01:03:30,480


848
01:03:40,410 --> 01:03:43,450


849
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:50,960
Don't shoot.

850
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,300


851
01:04:17,200 --> 01:04:20,160
I had to do it, Violet.

852
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:23,500
You saw it. I had no choice.

853
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:27,000
It was Johnnie.

854
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,170
Lying rat fuck. He made me do it.

855
01:04:31,550 --> 01:04:34,390
Hey! Hey!

856
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:38,850
You stupid fuck! You think you could set me up? Huh?

857
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:46,860
I'm a dead man, Johnnie? I'm a fucking dead man?

858
01:04:46,900 --> 01:04:49,700
Guess again, Johnnie. Who's the dead man? Who?

859
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:53,240
Who's dead, fuckface? Who? Who?

860
01:04:53,330 --> 01:04:56,120
I can't hear you, Johnnie. Guess again.

861
01:04:56,210 --> 01:05:00,090
Take another guess, Johnnie. Take another fuckin' guess.

862
01:05:11,940 --> 01:05:13,440
What are you doing?

863
01:05:24,450 --> 01:05:26,370
Maybe three hours.

864
01:05:26,460 --> 01:05:28,920
Caesar, what are you going to do?

865
01:05:30,290 --> 01:05:33,090
We're gonna get the money back.   What?

866
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:37,300
Violet, if we get the money back, then none of this ever happened.

867
01:05:37,390 --> 01:05:41,430
Caesar, you just killed Gino Marzzone.

868
01:05:41,520 --> 01:05:45,430
No, I didn't. Not if the bodies disappear.

869
01:05:45,470 --> 01:05:48,270
Not if the money's here. Then they never showed up.

870
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:50,980
What happened to them?

871
01:05:51,060 --> 01:05:53,940
I don't know. Maybe we'll never know.

872
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,280
My guess, it was a job.

873
01:06:01,490 --> 01:06:05,420
Maybe the Carpella's. All part of the business.

874
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:09,050
Look, once we find the money, then everything's gonna be all right.

875
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:13,470


876
01:06:15,010 --> 01:06:16,930
Somebody's coming.

877
01:06:18,930 --> 01:06:20,940


878
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,480
Fuck!   Oh, no.

879
01:06:23,560 --> 01:06:25,030
Fuck!

880
01:06:26,690 --> 01:06:29,820
Caesar, what are we gonna do?

881
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:33,660
They're just cops. Stall 'em as long as you can.

882
01:06:38,670 --> 01:06:40,590


883
01:06:45,590 --> 01:06:48,560


884
01:06:51,690 --> 01:06:53,730
Gino, man.

885
01:06:56,650 --> 01:06:59,320
Come on. Come on!

886
01:07:02,410 --> 01:07:06,790


887
01:07:06,870 --> 01:07:10,040


888
01:07:12,120 --> 01:07:13,580
Answer it.

889
01:07:16,080 --> 01:07:18,750


890
01:07:20,840 --> 01:07:23,510
Hello?   This is the police, ma'am.

891
01:07:23,590 --> 01:07:25,010
The police?

892
01:07:25,100 --> 01:07:28,020
We had a report of gunfire. Can you buzz us in, please?

893
01:07:28,100 --> 01:07:31,730
Gunfire? Is this a joke?   No joke, ma'am.

894
01:07:49,380 --> 01:07:51,590
Please open the door.   Um.

895
01:07:53,380 --> 01:07:56,430
How do I know that you're really the police?

896
01:07:59,390 --> 01:08:02,310
Ma'am, you have to open the door.

897
01:08:03,730 --> 01:08:05,480
All right.

898
01:09:02,340 --> 01:09:04,260


899
01:09:04,350 --> 01:09:06,270


900
01:09:34,970 --> 01:09:36,930


901
01:09:44,650 --> 01:09:46,610


902
01:09:48,030 --> 01:09:52,580
Now, if you're thinking about doing something stupid...

903
01:09:52,660 --> 01:09:57,840
remember, I just killed Gino Marzzone.

904
01:09:57,920 --> 01:10:00,250
You understand what that means?

905
01:10:01,630 --> 01:10:04,090
They're just cops.

906
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:18,230
See? We're for real.

907
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:24,280
I'm sorry. It's just that sometimes you hear stories.

908
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:25,990
You did the right thing.

909
01:10:34,960 --> 01:10:36,920
Come on in.

910
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,510
Hey, hey! Chicago's finest.

911
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:46,180
How's it going tonight, fellas?

912
01:10:46,270 --> 01:10:47,850
Very good, sir?

913
01:10:47,930 --> 01:10:51,150
I'm sorry. I got a bum ear. Can't hear shit with it.

914
01:10:51,230 --> 01:10:53,900
My name is Caesar, and this here is my Violet.

915
01:10:56,320 --> 01:11:01,120
So, Violet tells me there's some problems about gunshots.

916
01:11:01,200 --> 01:11:04,620
Uh, yes, sir. A neighbor in the building called in.

917
01:11:04,710 --> 01:11:08,090
I think we know what happened.   Probably just the television.

918
01:11:09,420 --> 01:11:11,510
Oh, the television.

919
01:11:11,550 --> 01:11:14,220
Honey, why don't you turn it off?

920
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:18,390
This happened before.

921
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,400
This ear, I was born with it.

922
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:24,280
The batteries went dead on my hearing aid. I'm sorry.

923
01:11:24,360 --> 01:11:26,240
It's all right.   No big deal.

924
01:11:26,320 --> 01:11:29,620
I hate to trouble you guys. Can I get you a beer?

925
01:11:29,700 --> 01:11:32,370
Uh, no. Not on duty. Sorry.

926
01:11:33,580 --> 01:11:36,120
But, uh, do you mind if I use your bathroom?

927
01:11:38,800 --> 01:11:41,080
No. Sure. It's right over here.

928
01:11:41,160 --> 01:11:42,870
Thanks.

929
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:45,630
Listen, do you mind if I make myself a drink?

930
01:11:45,710 --> 01:11:47,210
Yeah, right there.

931
01:11:47,300 --> 01:11:49,970
Sure. Go right ahead, sir.

932
01:12:07,370 --> 01:12:09,280


933
01:12:15,330 --> 01:12:17,300
This is a beautiful place.

934
01:12:17,340 --> 01:12:19,420
Thank you.

935
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,530
Is this a condo?

936
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:41,500
Okay, let's roll.

937
01:12:44,920 --> 01:12:48,550
Oh, try to keep extra batteries around for the aid, okay?

938
01:12:48,630 --> 01:12:50,090
Good idea.

939
01:12:54,350 --> 01:12:56,310
Come on. Let's go.

940
01:13:05,150 --> 01:13:06,990
Shit.

941
01:13:22,210 --> 01:13:24,210
Fuck! Where is it?

942
01:13:26,500 --> 01:13:27,920
Think.

943
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:31,970
It's gotta be at his place.

944
01:13:33,640 --> 01:13:35,430
Get in the car.

945
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:38,480
Caesar, I don't think     Get in the fucking car!

946
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:05,100
Two million dollars, Corky.

947
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:11,900
Two million dollars. It's gotta be here. It's gotta be.

948
01:14:11,940 --> 01:14:15,860
I just   I gotta think. Think Iike Johnnie.

949
01:14:15,950 --> 01:14:19,870
Okay, I'm Johnnie.

950
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,130
I come in.

951
01:14:28,050 --> 01:14:29,460
Where did I put it?

952
01:14:31,090 --> 01:14:35,100
That's a Iot of fuckin' money, and I gotta hide it.

953
01:14:36,220 --> 01:14:38,440
I gotta hide it. I don't have much time.

954
01:14:38,480 --> 01:14:42,810
I gotta get to the airport, pick up my fuckin' daddy!

955
01:14:42,890 --> 01:14:44,810


956
01:14:49,730 --> 01:14:52,940
I can't wait to see Caesar's face when he finds out.

957
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:06,630
Where did he put it?   C.

958
01:15:10,340 --> 01:15:12,300
Think. Think.

959
01:15:20,860 --> 01:15:23,530
Where is it, you motherfucker?

960
01:15:23,610 --> 01:15:25,530
Where? Where?

961
01:15:32,620 --> 01:15:34,540


962
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,350
C?

963
01:15:47,390 --> 01:15:49,350
C.

964
01:15:56,660 --> 01:15:58,780
It's not here, Caesar.

965
01:16:02,870 --> 01:16:04,790
Where is it?

966
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,080
I don't know. It could be anywhere.

967
01:16:09,160 --> 01:16:11,870
We don't even know if he was alone, Caesar.

968
01:16:11,960 --> 01:16:14,960
Come on. We have to get out of here.

969
01:16:15,050 --> 01:16:17,130
We don't have much time.

970
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,270
What are you doing?

971
01:16:38,120 --> 01:16:41,460
Gotta buy more time. More time.

972
01:16:41,540 --> 01:16:44,000
Who are you gonna call?

973
01:16:53,430 --> 01:16:55,350
Yeah?   Hey, Mickey.

974
01:16:55,430 --> 01:16:56,850
Oh, God.

975
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,440
Caesar, what the fuck time is it?

976
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,610
Oh, Mickey, did I wake you up? Listen, I'm sorry. I know it's late.

977
01:17:04,650 --> 01:17:07,950
I don't know if this is a big deal, but they ain't showed up yet.

978
01:17:08,030 --> 01:17:10,000
What? They ain't there?

979
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:14,080
No. I I I called the airport. The plane landed on time.

980
01:17:14,170 --> 01:17:17,590
I even called over at Johnnie's house, but there was no answer there.

981
01:17:17,670 --> 01:17:20,800
Okay. Let me call around. I'll see what I can do.

982
01:17:20,890 --> 01:17:22,850
Don't go anywhere, okay?

983
01:17:22,890 --> 01:17:24,970
Yeah, okay, sure.

984
01:17:25,060 --> 01:17:27,980
Caesar, you still have the money?

985
01:17:28,020 --> 01:17:30,020
Oh, yeah, Mickey, I still got the money.

986
01:17:30,060 --> 01:17:32,780
Starin' right at it.

987
01:17:32,860 --> 01:17:35,660
Good. Sit tight. I'll call you.

988
01:17:37,310 --> 01:17:38,730
Bye.

989
01:17:51,250 --> 01:17:53,840
So I'll start packing. You know what you have to do.

990
01:17:53,920 --> 01:17:57,510
I'll use Johnnie's car to dump the bodies in the lake.

991
01:17:57,550 --> 01:18:00,260
I need plastic bags, rope and tape.

992
01:18:01,390 --> 01:18:03,770
Just hurry.

993
01:18:16,910 --> 01:18:18,870
Please, Corky, please.

994
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,260
Thank God.   I'm still here.

995
01:18:26,340 --> 01:18:28,760
I was so afraid you were going to leave me.

996
01:18:30,010 --> 01:18:32,310
You don't quit on me, Violet. I won't quit on you.

997
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:41,820
Corky, it worked. He's going to run.

998
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:44,820
He needs to take care of the bodies to buy himseIf a little time...

999
01:18:44,910 --> 01:18:47,330
but as soon as he leaves, it's over.

1000
01:18:47,410 --> 01:18:49,450
Just a little while longer.

1001
01:18:51,160 --> 01:18:52,620
Corky...

1002
01:18:56,960 --> 01:18:58,920
I want to tell you something.

1003
01:18:58,970 --> 01:19:00,930
I know, Violet.

1004
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:06,140
I know.

1005
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,680
It's why I'm still here.

1006
01:19:29,210 --> 01:19:30,830
Who was that?

1007
01:19:30,920 --> 01:19:33,210
Vi, who the fuck was that?

1008
01:19:35,710 --> 01:19:38,800
Did you call Mickey? Did you call Mickey?

1009
01:19:38,890 --> 01:19:40,850
Did you!

1010
01:20:00,710 --> 01:20:03,670
Mickey, is that you?

1011
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:04,750
Fuck.

1012
01:20:12,890 --> 01:20:14,850


1013
01:20:25,950 --> 01:20:27,620


1014
01:20:30,250 --> 01:20:32,540
Who is that? Who's over there?

1015
01:20:32,580 --> 01:20:35,870
Who's over there? Tell me! Tell me!

1016
01:20:35,910 --> 01:20:40,170
No! Stop! Caesar! Caesar!

1017
01:20:43,420 --> 01:20:45,800


1018
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:49,220
No! No! No! Caesar!

1019
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:56,650


1020
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,830
Drop the fucking gun or die.

1021
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,750
Drop it!

1022
01:21:40,830 --> 01:21:42,210
Turn around.

1023
01:21:47,800 --> 01:21:49,220
You?

1024
01:21:51,220 --> 01:21:53,180
Holy fucking Christ.

1025
01:21:57,600 --> 01:21:59,980
You gotta be fucking kiddin' me.

1026
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,940
You gotta be fucking kiddin' me.

1027
01:22:10,490 --> 01:22:12,570
Hey!

1028
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:14,490
Come on!

1029
01:22:14,530 --> 01:22:17,160
Wake up. Wake up.

1030
01:22:20,880 --> 01:22:24,010
Wake up, you fucking dyke.

1031
01:22:26,260 --> 01:22:28,090
Good.

1032
01:22:29,390 --> 01:22:31,060
I know everything now.

1033
01:22:31,140 --> 01:22:34,690
So I don't wanna hear any "I don't know" bullshit, understand?

1034
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:41,400
God, I shouId've seen this coming the minute I met you.

1035
01:22:43,200 --> 01:22:46,120
Everybody knows your kind can't be trusted.

1036
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:49,410
Fuckin' queers. You make me sick.

1037
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:55,840
But you made a fatal mistake.

1038
01:22:55,920 --> 01:22:58,340
You tried to fuck the wrong guy...

1039
01:22:58,430 --> 01:23:01,060
and I swear to you...

1040
01:23:01,140 --> 01:23:03,230
I'm gonna kill you for it.

1041
01:23:04,390 --> 01:23:06,100
Where's my money?

1042
01:23:06,190 --> 01:23:08,980
Don't tell him. He can't kill you.

1043
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:12,280
Violet.   Not until he has the money.

1044
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:22,250
Now, where is it?

1045
01:23:22,290 --> 01:23:23,920
Lick me.

1046
01:23:24,000 --> 01:23:27,840
Where is my money?

1047
01:23:29,390 --> 01:23:33,140
Either pull the trigger, or get that fucking thing out of my face.

1048
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,180
Fuckin' cunt.

1049
01:23:35,260 --> 01:23:37,930
Caesar, stop acting like an asshole and think.

1050
01:23:38,010 --> 01:23:40,520
Violet, don't try to tell me what to do.

1051
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:42,890
You need the money just like we do.

1052
01:23:42,980 --> 01:23:45,440
Shut up!   Let us go. We'll make a deal.

1053
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:47,780
Shut the fuck up!

1054
01:23:49,360 --> 01:23:51,950
What did you do to her, huh?

1055
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:54,700
What did you fuckin' do to her?

1056
01:23:54,790 --> 01:23:56,870
That's not my Violet!

1057
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:00,790
What did she do to you?

1058
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:02,670
Everything you couldn't.

1059
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:10,850
You ungrateful fuckin' bitch.

1060
01:24:12,930 --> 01:24:16,270
Vi, you were nothing before you met me.

1061
01:24:16,360 --> 01:24:18,480
Don't you remember? You had nothing.

1062
01:24:19,860 --> 01:24:22,570
Who gave you this place, huh?

1063
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:24,620
Who gave it to you?

1064
01:24:24,700 --> 01:24:27,290
I did, Vi. I did.

1065
01:24:27,370 --> 01:24:30,830
You were nothing. You had nothing.

1066
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:34,960
What a load of crap. Take a look at yourself, Caesar.

1067
01:24:35,050 --> 01:24:38,590
You're nothing but a common thug. You launder money for the Mob.

1068
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:41,010
You rent women like you rented this apartment.

1069
01:24:41,060 --> 01:24:45,310
You used me, Caesar. That's all. Just like I used you.

1070
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:48,020
All part of the business.

1071
01:24:48,070 --> 01:24:50,570
You betrayed me.

1072
01:24:50,650 --> 01:24:52,360
You murdered Gino.

1073
01:24:52,450 --> 01:24:55,530
Yeah, sure. You made me. I had to do that.

1074
01:24:55,580 --> 01:24:58,080
Bullshit! You did it.

1075
01:24:58,160 --> 01:25:00,920
You did it because you couldn't stand the thought of Johnnie fucking you.

1076
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:02,420
Shut up.   You shut up.

1077
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,870
All right, Violet. All right!

1078
01:25:04,950 --> 01:25:07,870
You want the business, Violet? All of the business?

1079
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:11,250
I'll fucking give it to you. I'll give you all of it.

1080
01:25:11,340 --> 01:25:13,720
I'm gonna make you fuckin' suffer.

1081
01:25:13,800 --> 01:25:17,010
Just like Shelly, Violet. Just like fuckin' Shelly.

1082
01:25:23,690 --> 01:25:25,110
I'm sorry, Corky.

1083
01:25:25,190 --> 01:25:28,820
Don't be sorry. Help me.

1084
01:25:37,160 --> 01:25:39,580
Oh, no, no, no!

1085
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:42,800


1086
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,380
Hey, Vi, do you remember these?

1087
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:51,600
All right, I'm gonna start with Violet.

1088
01:25:51,640 --> 01:25:53,270


1089
01:25:53,310 --> 01:25:56,940
So you get an idea of what's comin'.

1090
01:26:02,660 --> 01:26:05,330
I'm gonna ask you ten questions.

1091
01:26:06,660 --> 01:26:10,290
Every time I don't get an answer...

1092
01:26:13,500 --> 01:26:15,630
I cut off a finger.

1093
01:26:17,680 --> 01:26:20,640


1094
01:26:23,560 --> 01:26:25,560
Where's the money?

1095
01:26:27,980 --> 01:26:30,440


1096
01:26:38,030 --> 01:26:39,610
It's Mickey.

1097
01:26:43,870 --> 01:26:47,580
I said, "Where's the money?"

1098
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:50,250
All right, I'll tell you.

1099
01:26:52,010 --> 01:26:53,840
It's in the apartment next door.

1100
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,010
I put it in the paint drums.

1101
01:26:56,090 --> 01:27:00,890
Good. Now, I promised you I wouId kill you. Remember?

1102
01:27:00,980 --> 01:27:03,270
You can't kill me.

1103
01:27:03,350 --> 01:27:05,730
Oh, really? Why not?

1104
01:27:05,820 --> 01:27:07,440
I could be lying.

1105
01:27:09,900 --> 01:27:12,160
You're gonna be sorry you said that.

1106
01:27:24,420 --> 01:27:26,340


1107
01:27:29,760 --> 01:27:31,220
Motherfucker!

1108
01:27:34,730 --> 01:27:36,150
Son of a bitch.

1109
01:27:42,320 --> 01:27:44,410
Keys, keys, keys, keys.

1110
01:27:54,460 --> 01:27:56,380


1111
01:28:27,540 --> 01:28:30,500


1112
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:35,590
I can kill you right now, if that's what you want.

1113
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:38,310
Or you can live.

1114
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:40,640
But I need your help.

1115
01:28:40,730 --> 01:28:44,400
You gotta help me make Mickey believe that everything is normal.

1116
01:28:44,480 --> 01:28:47,320
Now, what do you wanna do?

1117
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:50,110
Do you wanna live?

1118
01:29:04,220 --> 01:29:06,140


1119
01:29:21,990 --> 01:29:24,830
Oh! Oh, shit!

1120
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:29,500
Christ! Mickey, you scared the shit out of me.

1121
01:29:31,590 --> 01:29:34,000
What are you guys doin' with your peckers in your hand?

1122
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,000
You gonna do me, Mickey?

1123
01:29:37,540 --> 01:29:39,130
No. There was no answer.

1124
01:29:39,210 --> 01:29:41,800
I thought I heard some knocking at the door.

1125
01:29:41,880 --> 01:29:43,800
I was buzzing, I was knocking...

1126
01:29:43,880 --> 01:29:46,390
but I guess you couldn't hear me on account of being in the shower.

1127
01:29:46,470 --> 01:29:49,560
Yeah, well, you know, Mick, I'm all wound up.

1128
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:53,110
I'm driving myself crazy over this Gino thing, and, well...

1129
01:29:53,190 --> 01:29:56,650
Vi, you know, she thought maybe...

1130
01:29:56,740 --> 01:30:01,200
she could, you know, relax me in the

1131
01:30:03,450 --> 01:30:06,540
That Violet is one nice lady.

1132
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:10,250
I wish someone would help me relax.

1133
01:30:10,300 --> 01:30:15,090
Uh, let me get you guys a drink, huh?

1134
01:30:15,180 --> 01:30:18,140
I got scotch, whatever you want.

1135
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:23,060
We was worried about you.

1136
01:30:23,150 --> 01:30:24,770
Me? Why?

1137
01:30:24,820 --> 01:30:27,490
We went over to Johnnie's place, just to check it out.

1138
01:30:27,570 --> 01:30:29,280
It was busted up, bad.

1139
01:30:29,320 --> 01:30:31,160
What?

1140
01:30:31,240 --> 01:30:33,700
Started thinking maybe it's about the money.

1141
01:30:33,790 --> 01:30:37,420
So I call you, but all I got is the busy signal.

1142
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:40,420
I figure the phone is off the hook. That's why I come rushing over here.

1143
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:43,880
Fuck, the phone. Shit. That was me. I did that.

1144
01:30:43,970 --> 01:30:47,470
Fuck! That was a stupid thing to do, huh?

1145
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:52,190
Hey, if Violet was helping me relax...

1146
01:30:52,270 --> 01:30:54,150
I'd probably do the same thing.

1147
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:19,800
Hey, Caes, can I ask you something?

1148
01:31:19,880 --> 01:31:21,840
Sure.

1149
01:31:22,970 --> 01:31:25,390
Why did you move all the furniture around?

1150
01:31:29,890 --> 01:31:31,600
Let me guess.

1151
01:31:32,690 --> 01:31:35,070
That was Violet's idea too.

1152
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:40,700
Yeah, uh, actually...

1153
01:31:40,780 --> 01:31:43,540
she was nervous about Gino comin'...

1154
01:31:43,620 --> 01:31:45,660
and wanted everything to look perfect and

1155
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,670
You know women, Mick.

1156
01:31:47,750 --> 01:31:52,220
Sure, Caes. They make us do stupid things, don't they?

1157
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:01,390
Is that the money?   Yeah. Yeah, that's it.

1158
01:32:01,440 --> 01:32:03,060
What did it total out at?

1159
01:32:03,150 --> 01:32:05,190
2.176. 2.176\n2.176.

1160
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,240
That fuckin' Shelly.

1161
01:32:08,450 --> 01:32:10,530
Gotta hand it to the guy, but, Jesus...

1162
01:32:10,620 --> 01:32:13,410
if I were him, I would've bailed a long time ago.

1163
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:18,040
I mean, how much money does a man need?

1164
01:32:19,670 --> 01:32:24,380
I remember, I was just staring at all this goddamn money.

1165
01:32:24,470 --> 01:32:27,800
Shelly went down on his knees...

1166
01:32:27,890 --> 01:32:31,630
and the next thing I know, Johnnie just blows his head off.

1167
01:32:33,390 --> 01:32:35,760
What a fuckin' mess.

1168
01:32:35,810 --> 01:32:37,770
Johnnie's laughing his ass off...

1169
01:32:37,810 --> 01:32:41,270
and that's when Caesar lost it.

1170
01:32:41,310 --> 01:32:42,820
And boom.

1171
01:32:42,900 --> 01:32:45,320
He cold cocked him.

1172
01:32:45,400 --> 01:32:49,530
He cold cocks fuckin' Johnnie Marzzone.

1173
01:32:49,620 --> 01:32:53,370


1174
01:32:53,450 --> 01:32:56,790
Hey, Caesar.

1175
01:33:00,340 --> 01:33:01,800
Where's the key?

1176
01:33:02,840 --> 01:33:05,140
Um, the key

1177
01:33:07,600 --> 01:33:11,600
Oh, they're in my pants in the bathroom.

1178
01:33:11,690 --> 01:33:14,900
Ah, fuck it. I don't need the key.

1179
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:19,620
I didn't need a key to get in here, did I?

1180
01:33:19,700 --> 01:33:22,370


1181
01:33:36,640 --> 01:33:39,480


1182
01:33:42,150 --> 01:33:44,440
Who the hell could that be?

1183
01:33:49,160 --> 01:33:50,570
Are you gonna answer it?

1184
01:33:50,660 --> 01:33:52,160
Yeah.

1185
01:34:00,990 --> 01:34:02,710
Hello?   Hello, Caesar.

1186
01:34:02,790 --> 01:34:04,830
This is Gino.   What?

1187
01:34:04,920 --> 01:34:08,340
You're blowing your only chance, asshole. Act like I'm Gino.

1188
01:34:09,880 --> 01:34:12,840
Holy Christ! We've been worried sick about you, Gino.

1189
01:34:12,930 --> 01:34:14,350
Good boy.   It's Gino.

1190
01:34:14,430 --> 01:34:16,600
Where the hell is he?   We were in a car accident.

1191
01:34:16,680 --> 01:34:19,270
They were in a car accident.   But everybody's all right.

1192
01:34:19,350 --> 01:34:22,400
Everybody's all right. Just bruises and shit.

1193
01:34:22,480 --> 01:34:25,440
Un fucking believabIe. I called those highway patrols. Dumb fucks.

1194
01:34:25,530 --> 01:34:27,450
Mick, please. I'm trying to hear Gino.

1195
01:34:27,530 --> 01:34:30,700
Now you listen to me, asshole. I know your gun is behind the bar.

1196
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:33,870
Either we make a deal right now, or I hand this phone to Mickey.

1197
01:34:33,460 --> 01:34:35,370
I'm listening.

1198
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:39,920
All right. I want what's mine. I want half the money.

1199
01:34:40,010 --> 01:34:42,970
We get rid of Mickey, and no one else dies.

1200
01:34:43,010 --> 01:34:46,260
No one. Say, "Yes, I understand."

1201
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:48,310
Yes, I understand.

1202
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:51,650
Tell them I'm at St. Mary's off the Kennedy in the waiting room.

1203
01:34:51,730 --> 01:34:54,320
Stay on the phone until I come out.

1204
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:57,360
Okay. Right.

1205
01:34:57,450 --> 01:34:59,620
St. Mary's off the Kennedy.

1206
01:34:59,660 --> 01:35:01,280
Yeah.

1207
01:35:01,370 --> 01:35:02,950
Johnnie's okay?

1208
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:05,460
Mickey? What are you doing here?

1209
01:35:05,540 --> 01:35:08,290
Violet, it's Gino and Johnnie. They were in a car accident.

1210
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:10,380
Oh, my God! Is everybody all right?

1211
01:35:10,460 --> 01:35:12,630
I think everything's okay.   All right. Bye.

1212
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:14,840
They're at St. Mary's. Can you fucking believe this?

1213
01:35:14,930 --> 01:35:17,100
I can't fit them all in my car, so give me your keys.

1214
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,640
Sure.   You drive my car.

1215
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:20,980
Vi! Vi!

1216
01:35:21,020 --> 01:35:25,020
Do me a favor. Go in my pants in the bathroom and get my keys.

1217
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:28,110
Come on. Let's go. Vi, let's go!

1218
01:35:38,660 --> 01:35:41,580
Thanks, V.   Call me as soon as you get there.

1219
01:35:41,660 --> 01:35:43,790
Leave your phone on the hook.

1220
01:35:48,420 --> 01:35:50,510
Now, that's teamwork.

1221
01:35:50,590 --> 01:35:53,470
I should've let 'em kill you.

1222
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,810
He would've done you too.

1223
01:35:55,380 --> 01:35:57,810
I knew I couldn't trust you.

1224
01:35:57,380 --> 01:36:01,690
Relax. I said I would let you live...

1225
01:36:01,770 --> 01:36:04,070
and I will.

1226
01:36:04,890 --> 01:36:06,820
Maybe.

1227
01:36:13,960 --> 01:36:18,250
Let's go see if your dyke was dumb enough to lie.

1228
01:36:17,840 --> 01:36:20,470
Let's go.

1229
01:36:22,630 --> 01:36:24,600


1230
01:36:45,500 --> 01:36:47,210
Yes.

1231
01:36:47,630 --> 01:36:49,750
No!

1232
01:36:52,100 --> 01:36:54,050
Violet!

1233
01:37:00,920 --> 01:37:03,350
Violet! Violet!

1234
01:37:09,980 --> 01:37:11,940
Violet!

1235
01:37:44,090 --> 01:37:46,530
Come on, please.

1236
01:37:52,870 --> 01:37:54,790


1237
01:37:54,350 --> 01:37:57,590
Bitch! You fuckin' bitch!

1238
01:38:20,660 --> 01:38:22,660
Mickey?   Violet?

1239
01:38:22,190 --> 01:38:25,540
Oh, God, Mickey. He made me do it.

1240
01:38:25,060 --> 01:38:28,160
I was so afraid. I didn't want to, Mickey.

1241
01:38:27,700 --> 01:38:31,210
It was Caesar, all Caesar. He made me help him.

1242
01:38:30,770 --> 01:38:35,630
You have to help me. Oh, God! Oh, God, he's coming!

1243
01:38:50,660 --> 01:38:53,280
Corky?

1244
01:38:58,260 --> 01:39:00,240
Oh, fuck.

1245
01:39:41,680 --> 01:39:42,970


1246
01:39:43,050 --> 01:39:44,430


1247
01:39:58,140 --> 01:40:01,030
Stop!

1248
01:40:01,570 --> 01:40:03,950
Oh, for Christ's sakes.

1249
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:09,830
It's over, Caesar.

1250
01:40:10,710 --> 01:40:13,670
I called Mickey. He's on his way.

1251
01:40:14,990 --> 01:40:18,470
Get out of here, Caesar.

1252
01:40:17,990 --> 01:40:21,300
If you want to live, you'd better start running.

1253
01:40:22,830 --> 01:40:26,020
All these years, and you still don't know me.

1254
01:40:28,890 --> 01:40:30,860
But I know you.

1255
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:32,570
Caesar, don't.

1256
01:40:33,390 --> 01:40:36,990
What are you gonna do with that, Vi? Shoot me?

1257
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,870
Kill me in cold blood? I don't think so.

1258
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:45,880
If you were gonna shoot me, Vi, you'd have done it a long time ago.

1259
01:40:45,400 --> 01:40:51,050
If I were you, I'd have shot me the minute I brought the money back.

1260
01:40:50,580 --> 01:40:55,390
But you didn't, and I'llI tell you why.

1261
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:57,810
You don't want to shoot me, Vi.

1262
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:01,190
Do you?

1263
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:03,570
Do you?

1264
01:41:04,530 --> 01:41:06,570
I know you don't.

1265
01:41:08,630 --> 01:41:11,910
Caesar, you don't know shit.

1266
01:41:28,590 --> 01:41:29,800


1267
01:41:58,190 --> 01:42:02,970
I'll never understand it, Mickey. You didn't even call the police.

1268
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:06,980
I told you. The family doesn't want the police around.

1269
01:42:06,500 --> 01:42:10,020
We want to take care of it ourselves, and we will.

1270
01:42:10,640 --> 01:42:14,450
I'll find him. I swear I will.

1271
01:42:13,940 --> 01:42:16,450
I know you will.

1272
01:42:18,040 --> 01:42:20,750
Sure you're gonna be okay?

1273
01:42:20,240 --> 01:42:24,420
I mean, if you're having second thoughts...

1274
01:42:25,450 --> 01:42:28,210
my offer still stands.

1275
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:32,350
Thanks, Mickey, but I have to get out.

1276
01:42:31,860 --> 01:42:36,680
You know, I have to get away from all this.

1277
01:42:36,200 --> 01:42:38,690
But thanks.

1278
01:42:44,980 --> 01:42:47,490
Thanks for everything.

1279
01:43:20,200 --> 01:43:22,950
Hey.   Hey.

1280
01:43:22,430 --> 01:43:25,240
So, how'd it go?

1281
01:43:24,710 --> 01:43:28,410
I'm here, aren't I?   Mm hmm.

1282
01:43:30,660 --> 01:43:32,250


1283
01:43:34,450 --> 01:43:37,550
Well, I thought we might need a getaway car.

1284
01:43:37,040 --> 01:43:38,760
Hmm.

1285
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:43,850


1286
01:43:41,140 --> 01:43:45,860
You know what the difference is between you and me, Violet?.

1287
01:43:44,520 --> 01:43:47,860
No

1288
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:48,440
Me, neither.

1289
01:43:55,340 --> 01:43:56,890
{\i1}*  Well, she's all you'd ever want *

1290
01:43:56,980 --> 01:44:00,300
{\i1}*  She's the kind I'd like to flaunt and take to dinner *

1291

01:44:13,330 --> 01:44:17,280

1293
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,700
{\i1}*  Talkin' about that little lady *

1294
01:44:21,770 --> 01:44:25,440
{\i1}*  And the lady is mine *

1295
01:44:26,980 --> 01:44:28,810
{\i1}*  But she's never in the way *

1296
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:34,840
{\i1}*  Always something nice to say What a blessing *

1297
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:36,950
{\i1}*  I can leave her on her own *

1298
01:44:37,020 --> 01:44:40,880
{\i1}*  Knowing she's okay alone and there's no messin' *

1299
01:44:42,960 --> 01:44:45,390
{\i1}*  She's a lady *

1300
01:44:45,460 --> 01:44:49,590

1302
01:44:54,200 --> 01:44:58,130
{\i1}*  And the lady is mine *

1303
01:44:59,510 --> 01:45:01,770
{\i1}*  No she never asks very much *

1304
01:45:01,850 --> 01:45:03,820

1305
01:45:03,880 --> 01:45:05,780

1306
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:08,080
{\i1}*  I never would abuse her *

1307
01:45:08,160 --> 01:45:09,740

1308
01:45:09,830 --> 01:45:11,790

1309
01:45:11,860 --> 01:45:18,680
