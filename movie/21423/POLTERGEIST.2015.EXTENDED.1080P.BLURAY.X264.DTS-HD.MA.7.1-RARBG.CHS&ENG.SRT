1
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,470
葛瑞芬，葛瑞芬
Griffin. Griffin.

2
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:35,620
- 葛瑞芬，我讲过了  - 我玩到一半
- Griffin, what did I say? - I'm in the middle of a game.

3
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,180
你要吃晕车药才能在车上玩游戏
You can't play that in the car unless you take your Dramamine.

4
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,660
现在吃也太晚了，我们快到了
It's too late for Dramamine. We're practically there.

5
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,870
别对我翻白眼
Don't roll your eyes at me.

6
00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:43,390
你希望他又吐在车上吗？
You want him puking in the car again?

7
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,190
- 我说对不起了  - 那不是你的错
- I said I was sorry. - No, it's not your fault.

8
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,550
很臭哎
That was smelly.

9
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:49,510
- 才没有！那是意外  - 没人怪你，宝贝
- Was not! It was only an accident. - Nobody's blaming you, honeybun.

10
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,550
本来就很臭
It was smelly.

11
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:51,630
我跟着导航
- I'm following the GPS.

12
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:52,550
超臭的
- It stinked.

13
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:54,070
看，她说在猫鹰街左转
Look, she says left on Kitty Hawk.

14
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,190
不，不，爸
No, no, Dad.

15
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,870
- 我不要住这里  - 哦，别这样
- There's no way we can live here. - Oh, come on.

16
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,470
你又还没看到房子
You haven't even seen the house yet.

17
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:01,030
- 这边有电缆线  - 没事
- There are power lines. - Relax.

18
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,390
我身体里开始长肿瘤了
- I can feel the tumors forming already.

19
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:04,030
没人会长肿瘤
- No one's getting tumors.

20
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,910
- 什么肿瘤？  - 开玩笑的
- What tumors? - It's a joke.

21
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,990
你这白痴
Dumbass.

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,350
是笑话，白痴！
- It's a joke, dumbass!

23
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,590
不要这样说，宝贝
- Don't say that, sweetie.

24
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:11,550
15米后掉头
- Make a U-turn in 50 feet.

25
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,710
什么？
- What?

26
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,550
- 你忘了转弯？  - 是的，夫人
- You missed the turn? - Yes, ma'am.

27
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,550
白痴，耶！
Dumbass. Whee!

28
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,230
来吧
Come on.

29
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,070
不错吧？
Nice, right?

30
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,910
嗯
Yeah.

31
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,420
挺舒服的
Cozy.

32
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,910
我觉得挺好的
I think it's nice.

33
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,750
我也觉得挺好的
I think it's nice, too.

34
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:58,870
小猪兽也这么想
Piggy-corn, too.

35
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:00,070
包温先生、太太
Mr. and Mrs. Bowen.

36
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,870
嗨，抱歉来晚了  我们忘了在猫鹰街那转弯
Hi. Sorry we're late. We missed that turn on Kitty Hawk.

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,910
对啊，现代科技嘛
Yeah, modern technology.

38
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,680
她直接跑进去看了
She's just gonna go right in, start checking it out.

39
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,750
这篮筐好棒
That hoop is cool.

40
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,590
这棵树也不错吧
Nice tree, huh?

41
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,270
这棵树的历史比这里所有的房子还久
That's been here longer than any of the houses.

42
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,910
爬树一定很好玩
Be fun to climb.

43
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,430
- 妈，有个厨房！  - 哦，哇
- Mom, there's a kitchen! - Oh, wow.

44
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,790
我去看我房间！
I'm gonna go see my bedroom!

45
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,630
慢慢来，上楼梯小心
Slow down, please, on the stairs.

46
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,940
防盗系统没问题
That security system works. The owner was a bit of a technophile,

47
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:30,020
屋主是技术控，什么线都拉好了
so this house is wired for whatever you might need.

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,070
墙上都有喇叭，每间房都能听音乐
You'll notice he put speakers in all of the walls,so you can hear music in every room...

49
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,190
连厕所都有
including the john.

50
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,710
这边过去是厨房
So, this is the kitchen through here.

51
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,790
- 你们要看看吗？  - 当然
- Do you wanna see this? - Sure.

52
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,910
你们有人要坐公共交通上班吗？
- Will either of you two be commuting to work?

53
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,790
我不用，我在家带小孩
- Not me. I'll be home with the kids.

54
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,950
- 艾米是很棒的作家  - 哦，艾瑞克！
- Amy is an amazing writer. - Oh, Eric!

55
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,380
- 是真的  - 别说了！
- She is. - Come on!

56
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,470
她只是谦虚，她真的很厉害
She's being very humble right now. She's very good.

57
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,550
我很努力，但很难抽出时间
I'm trying to be, but you know, it's just hard to find the time.

58
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,150
我懂，我也有两个小孩
I know, believe me, I have two of my own.

59
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,270
他们都上大学了，真高兴他们都走了
They're in college. I'm glad they're gone.

60
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:02,950
我是说我总算又能拥有自己的生活了
I mean, I'm getting my life back.

61
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,670
您说过您在哪高就，包温先生？
Where did you say that you worked, Mr. Bowen?

62
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,670
强鹿公司，在莫林那里
John Deere corporate, over in Moline.

63
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,820
那是家好公司
That's a wonderful company.

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,400
我们有辆驾驶式割草机  很耐用，我们很爱强鹿牌
We have a riding mower. It's lasted us for years. We love John Deere.

65
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:17,470
如果我没被裁员现在一定很高兴
Well, I'd be very flattered right now if I hadn't gotten laid off.

66
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,110
- 抱歉，我不知道  - 没关系
- I'm sorry. I didn't realize... - That's all right.

67
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,510
我们的割草机质量是不错，没事
They do have a quality... mower. It's fine.

68
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,510
真的，但…
They do, but...

69
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,470
他们要裁员，我就…
They were making some cutbacks, and I was...

70
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:28,150
嘿，艾瑞克，来看这个
Hey, Eric, come look at this.

71
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,670
我也想，亲爱的，但我正在尴尬地聊天
I'd love to, but I'm in the middle of a very awkward exchange with our realtor right now.

72
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,510
来看看
- Come see.

73
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,350
不好意思
- Is that all right?

74
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,750
- 请别离开  - 请便
- Don't go anywhere. - Please.

75
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:39,830
- 你看那边有一块空地  - 是哦
- Look, there's a field down there. - Oh, hey.

76
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,510
- 那是谁的地？  - 市政府的
- Whose property is that? - That's city property.

77
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,190
那边会很容易起火
That's a good place for a brushfire.

78
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,510
你得试着喜欢这间房子
You have to try to like this.

79
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,350
好，我会的
Okay. I'll try.

80
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:54,190
你们想去楼上看看吗？
Would you like to see the upstairs?

81
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,710
我要去
Yes, I would.

82
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,950
你要带我们看主卧房吗？
And this is a master that you're showing us?

83
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,550
没错
That's correct.

84
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,540
上面怎样，孩子们？
How is it up there, kiddo?

85
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,940
我比较喜欢我们家
I like our house better.

86
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,990
我们别无选择，宝贝
Well, that's not an option, honey.

87
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,990
那根本不是卧房，是阁楼
You can call that a bedroom, but really, it's an attic.

88
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,190
葛瑞芬可以睡那里
That can be where Griffin sleeps.

89
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,710
这里采光很好
This place has so much light.

90
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:18,190
对吧，艾瑞克？
Huh, Eric?

91
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,750
很不错
Very nice.

92
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,230
是啊
Yeah.

93
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,590
非常好
Very nice.

94
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,870
这间房子面对…
The house faces...

95
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:27,750
对，街道的这一侧比较安静
Yeah, it's a little bit quiet on this side of the street...

96
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:31,270
一个街口以外，人已经越来越多了
but just one block up, things are starting to fill up.

97
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,790
真好玩，对
It's funny. Yeah.

98
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,470
小猪兽？
Piggy-corn?

99
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:44,070
不，小猪兽不是我的宝宝
No, Piggy-corn's not my baby.

100
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,390
她只是玩偶
She's just a doll.

101
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,470
她一半是小猪，一半是独角兽，看？
She's half-pig and half-unicorn, see?

102
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,830
这边有一只角，呜呜
She has a little horn. Honk, honk.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,750
你在跟谁说话？
Who are you talking to?

104
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:55,190
没有人
No one.

105
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,480
妈，我们喜欢这间房子！
Mom, we like this house!

106
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:30,510
老天，这完全卡住了
Jesus, this is really stuck.

107
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,510
可能太潮湿了，上礼拜都在下雨
That's probably just moisture. It rained last week.

108
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:39,030
好吧，我不知道
Okay. Well, I don't know.

109
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,230
我们预算里的房子都是这样的
All the houses are like this in our price range.

110
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,390
这幢是最不烂的
And this is the least sucky one we've seen...

111
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,550
- 我觉得，也许…  - 也许？
- so I think, maybe... - Maybe?

112
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,790
这个区有很多银行抵押房
Okay, look. Foreclosures have hit this neighborhood really hard.

113
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:52,110
所以还是有议价空间
There's some wiggle room on the price.

114
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,550
空间有多大？
How much wiggle we talking?

115
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,830
廉价搬家

116
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,710
小心点啊！
Come on, man!

117
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,030
抱歉
Sorry.

118
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:05,980
真好
Perfect.

119
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,990
别这么沮丧，孩子，这是暂时的
Buck up, kiddo. It's temporary.

120
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,710
我们毁了你的人生
We've ruined your life.

121
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,780
太棒了
Good.

122
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,070
万岁！
Yay!

123
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,590
嗨
Hey, hey, hey.

124
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:20,030
行了
Come on.

125
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,670
你说你会丢掉它们的
You said you wanted to get rid of that stuff.

126
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,710
你开玩笑吧
What, are you kidding?

127
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,150
这是我的旧货  为葛瑞芬存的
This is my old bat bank. I'm saving it for Griff.

128
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,260
对
Yeah, right.

129
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,740
葛瑞芬，我们练练
Griff, let's play some catch. Here.

130
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,750
起来！
Hi-yo, Silver!

131
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,910
很好，包温队！
Yeah! Nice. Team Bowen!

132
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,070
艾瑞克，随他去
Eric, leave him be.

133
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,140
我们很好
Well, we're bonding.

134
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,300
我不觉得
I don't know that you are.

135
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,950
我扔给你球，好吗？
I'll throw you a ball, okay?

136
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,260
为什么？
Why?

137
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,030
好玩
'Cause it's fun.

138
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:47,590
我给你一个短高球，好吗？
I'll throw you a pop-up, okay?

139
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:49,390
你得接住
You gotta go for this one.

140
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,150
准备好没？
Okay, you ready?

141
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,550
你接到了
You got it.

142
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,750
是我的错
Well, that's my bad.

143
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,100
我没接住
I missed.

144
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,420
没事儿
That's okay.

145
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:04,670
我们再试，是我的错  我没扔好
We'll try again later. It was my fault. I threw it too hard.

146
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,510
接球吧？
Well, get the ball, will you, kiddo?

147
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,950
很好！
Good job!

148
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,750
我们可以踢足球
He can play soccer.

149
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,470
或象棋
Yeah. Or chess, Eric.

150
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,470
我要把它丢掉
I'm getting rid of this.

151
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:18,310
你见过棒球吗？
Have you seen the baseball?

152
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,270
妈妈
Mom! Mom! Mom!

153
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,500
树发出了噪音
The tree made a noise!

154
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,580
- 什么？  - 树在嗥叫
- What? - The tree growled!

155
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,420
葛瑞芬  这是一棵老树
Okay, look, Griff, Griff, Griff, Griff. It's an old tree.

156
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,030
老了就会裂
Okay? Things creak when they get old.

157
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,100
告诉我
Yeah, tell me about it.

158
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,830
就像爸爸
Right? Like Daddy.

159
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,070
我怎么能让你开心？
What can I do to make it better?

160
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:27,750
我不知道
I don't know.

161
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,670
何不就去看看你的新房间
You wanna go inside and check out your new room?

162
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,220
- 好吗？  - 好
- Yeah? - Yeah.

163
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,590
- 我们丢掉它好吗？  - 我不知道
- All right. Can we get rid of this? - I don't know.

164
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,710
- 说好  - 好
- Say yes. - Yes.

165
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:38,430
妈妈老了也会裂
Mommies creak when they get old too.

166
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,270
如果坏人打破窗户怎么办？
What if the bad guys break in a window?

167
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,910
警报器会响
Then the alarm will still go off.

168
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:04,070
但如果坏人剪断电线呢？
But what if the bad guys cut the wires to the alarm?

169
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:06,030
电线在房子里
The wires are in the house.

170
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:09,070
如果坏人去发电厂剪电线呢？
But what if the bad guys go to the power plant and cut the wires there?

171
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:12,630
他们会触电然后死掉
They'll be electrocuted and then they'll be dead.

172
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,110
如果他们死掉了，就不会进屋了
And if they're dead, then they can't get in the house.

173
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,260
警报开了？
We armed yet?

174
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:18,910
快好了
Getting there.

175
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,190
也许可以考虑养只狗
Might wanna think about getting a dog or something.

176
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,580
不要！
No!

177
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,070
这边说要按密码再按“停留”键
Here, it says you have to input the security code, and then the Stay key.

178
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,460
哦，是吗，聪明鬼？
Oh, yeah, smart guy?

179
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,700
怎么搞的？
What was that?

180
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,020
我刚刚也被电到了
Same thing happened to me.

181
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,710
这不是很怪吗？又不是冬天
Isn't that weird? It's not even winter.

182
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:38,830
它们找到这房子，把它整个吃掉
And they found this house, and they ate it all up.

183
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,260
你在做什么？
What are you doing?

184
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,620
在玩啊
Playing.

185
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,430
你要看我变魔术吗？
Do you wanna see a trick?

186
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,910
什么魔术？
What kind of trick?

187
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,430
不可能，你怎么做到的？
No way. How are you doing that?

188
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,550
你试试看
You try.

189
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,270
你看起来好好笑！
You look ridiculous!

190
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,910
糟糕
Shoot.

191
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,750
那是什么？
What is that?

192
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:06,430
我只是把耳环丢在洗衣机后面了
I just lost an earring behind the washing machine.

193
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,470
那是长号
That's a bummer, honey.

194
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,470
我去找
I'll go look for it.

195
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,270
那儿有个缝
There's a leak back there.

196
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:16,230
有个新家真好
Great. Welcome to owning a new home.

197
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,620
我得做点什么
I had to do something.

198
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,310
这真是个鬼地方
This place is, like, a complete shithole.

199
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,700
连购物中心都没有
There's not even any malls. Like, the malls are boarded up.

200
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:26,390
天  很惨
Oh, my God, that actually sounds really sad.

201
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,150
- 你爸爸找不到  - 差劲
- So, your dad can't find... - Dude.

202
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:31,350
这个20年代的平房  是个杀人现场
This 1920s bungalow was the site of a murder.

203
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,230
我喜欢那出戏
Oh, yeah, I love that show.

204
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:37,620
天，那人真奇怪
Oh, my God, that guy's a total freak.

205
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:39,230
对
I know.

206
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,260
我是卡利根伯克  我来打扫房间
I'm Carrigan Burke, and I'm here to clean house.

207
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,830
对，我喜欢他说
Oh, yeah. I love when he's, like... Okay, ready?

208
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,390
“房间干净了”
"This house is clean."

209
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:50,460
“干净了”
"Is clean."

210
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,950
你能关掉它吗？
Hey, hey, hey. Can you turn that down?

211
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,510
进来吗？
Come in?

212
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,870
孩子们要睡觉
Kids are going to sleep.

213
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,910
你好，萝伦
Hi, Lauren.

214
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,430
你好，包温太太
Hey, Mrs. Bowen.

215
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,070
谢谢，晚安
Thank you. Good night.

216
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,340
包温太太？
"Mrs. Bowen"?

217
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:18,430
孩子们，得睡觉了
All right, lovebugs. It's time for bed.

218
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,350
这么乱，能收拾一下吗，葛瑞芬？
Look at this mess. Can you clean this up, Griff?

219
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:21,580
门卡住了
The door's stuck.

220
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,940
真好！
Awesome!

221
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,180
我想里面有磁铁
- I think there are magnets in there.

222
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,660
他们不是磁铁，是我朋友
- They're not magnets. They're my friends.

223
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,070
谁是你朋友？
Who are your friends?

224
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,390
迷路的人
The lost people.

225
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,470
谁是迷路的人？
The lost people? Who are the lost people?

226
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:39,870
他们住在这里，但不喜欢这里  他们想回家
They live here. But they don't like it. They wanna go to their home.

227
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,870
宝贝，我们在家里
Sweetheart, we are home.

228
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,990
我们没迷路
We're not lost.

229
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,870
这是我们的暂时的家，好吗？
This is our home for a little while, okay?

230
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,550
好，妈妈
Okay, Mommy.

231
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,620
你确定？
You sure?

232
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:15,380
为什么我要睡在上面这里？
But why do I have to be up here?

233
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,070
因为这是屋子里最酷的房间
Because this is the coolest room in the house.

234
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:21,620
而你是屋子里最酷的小孩
And you are the coolest kid in the house.

235
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,020
但我讨厌这个天花板
But I don't like the ceiling.

236
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:26,950
别说傻话了，睡吧
Now you're just being silly. Come on.

237
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,430
谁是我的超人宝贝？
Who's my super boy?

238
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:33,660
妈
Mom.

239
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,750
怎么，你长大就不喜欢了？
I'm sorry, are you too big to say it now?

240
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,140
不是
No.

241
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,870
那谁是我的超人宝贝？
Then who's my super boy?

242
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,750
我是
I am.

243
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,230
对，就是你
Yeah, you are.

244
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,020
我爱你
I love you.

245
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,230
我也爱你
I love you, too.

246
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:51,030
好好睡觉，好吗？
All right, get some sleep, okay?

247
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,030
夜灯！我要夜灯！
The night-light! Night-light!

248
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,110
对不起，对不起，这样可以吗？
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Okay, okay, okay?

249
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,220
好些了吗？
Is that better?

250
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,990
葛瑞芬，没什么好怕的
Griffin, there's nothing to be afraid of.

251
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,780
好吧
Okay.

252
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,350
晚安，小家伙
Good night, buddy.

253
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,660
晚安
Good night.

254
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,710
葛瑞芬在叫什么？
What was Griff freaking out about?

255
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,230
- 他要夜灯  - 哦？
- The night-light. - Yeah?

256
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,830
“我要夜灯！”不知道他怎么了
"The night-light, the night-light!" I don't know what it is with him.

257
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,550
是啊，我们小孩太多了
Yeah, well, we got too many kids.

258
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:47,030
没错，两个应该就够了
I know. I said we should have stopped at two.

259
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,910
小梅不是问题
Maddy's not the problem.

260
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,420
还不是而已
Not yet.

261
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,910
敬那些小混蛋
Here's to the little jerks.

262
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,670
要带他去看心理医生吗？
Do you think we should take him to a shrink?

263
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:00,670
不用，他很好
No. No. He's fine.

264
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:04,190
他不好，都怪我在购物中心把他搞丢过
He's not fine. It's because I lost him in that mall.

265
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:06,660
宝贝，那是三年前了
Baby. That was three years ago...

266
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,910
你比他还要恐慌
and you were more freaked out than he was.

267
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:11,150
有些小孩就是容易紧张啊
Some kids are just nervous, you know?

268
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:12,990
我弟弟也是一样
- My brother was the same way.

269
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,300
现在他一人住在拖车里
- Yeah, now he lives alone in a trailer park.

270
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,350
- 他不是一个人  - 他是！
- He doesn't live alone. - Yes, he does!

271
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,310
不是，他有20只鹦鹉吧
No, he's got, like, 20 cockatoos.

272
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,040
你根本不是在安慰我！
You are not making me feel better!

273
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,270
说不定你可以去当教练
Maybe you could coach.

274
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,190
去高中吗？
What, high school?

275
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,630
对呀，应该很不错，你会很开心
Yeah. It'd be something. I mean, you'd be happy.

276
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,510
对，我会饿死，我们都会
Yeah, I'd be hungry. We'd all be.

277
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:56,030
在高中当教练养不活一家人
Can't support a family coaching high school.

278
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,870
我应该回去工作
I should go back to work.

279
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,150
又来了？别这样，你不会想要的
Again with that? Come on. You don't wanna do that.

280
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,630
你要把我和这些小怪物丢在一起？
You're gonna leave me all alone with these monsters?

281
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:05,670
我要买新内裤了，你看
I need new underwear. Look at these.

282
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,030
超悲伤的
These are sad.

283
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,390
你的内裤悲伤？
Your underwear is sad?

284
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:11,150
对，我的内裤很悲伤
Yes, my underwear is sad.

285
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:14,350
但我的很开心，过来吧
Well, mine are very happy right now, so get over here.

286
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:16,510
我说真的
I'm serious.

287
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,910
你不能用以前的薪水来拒绝工作
You can't keep holding out for something at your old salary.

288
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,190
是你在拒绝我吧
I think you're holding out.

289
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,150
- 干嘛不让我去工作？  - 我没有
- Why can't I just look for something? - I'm not holding out.

290
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:26,150
因为我们说好我工作你写书的
Because we agreed I'd work so you could write your book.

291
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,990
我们说好的
That's what we agreed about.

292
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,310
我没有在写书
I'm not writing my book.

293
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:32,030
等小孩去上学你就会写了
You will, when the kids go back to school.

294
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,990
别推到小孩身上，问题在我
Don't put this on the kids. This is all me.

295
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,830
嘿，我会找到工作的，好吧？
Hey, I'm gonna find something, okay?

296
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,350
你要相信我
You gotta trust me.

297
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,030
我们明晚要去参加派对
We got that dinner party tomorrow night.

298
00:19:41,040 --> 00:19:44,190
你最喜欢派对了，我会喝波本酒
You love parties. You can watch me drink bourbon.

299
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:47,190
派对一定很闷，我们又不认识这些人
It's gonna be such a drag. We don't even know those people.

300
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,430
但盖瑞认识，他说那家男人可能要雇人
But Gary knows them. He says the husband might be hiring.

301
00:19:49,680 --> 00:19:50,870
是啊
Yeah.

302
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:54,190
可能我们要转运了，你没感觉到吗？
Maybe our luck is about to change. Aren't you feeling lucky?

303
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,230
我觉得在“往上”了
I think things are looking up.

304
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:00,030
你这个呆子！
You're such a dork!

305
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:02,950
我是呆子？我是呆子？
I'm a dork? I'm a dork?

306
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:05,110
你和你悲伤的内裤
You and your sad underwear.

307
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,190
脱掉裤子
Take your pants off.

308
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:07,950
是的，夫人
Yes, ma'am.

309
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:09,710
- 真的吗？  - 对，真的
- Really? - Yes, really.

310
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:10,860
- 哇  - 准备上场
- Wow. - Play ball.

311
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,100
太好了
All right.

312
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,700
- 爸！  - 什么？
- Dad! - Yes!

313
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,710
嘿，怎么了，小家伙？
Hey. What's up, buddy?

314
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,190
楼上有东西
There's something upstairs.

315
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,910
我觉得我房间有东西
I think there's something in my room.

316
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,230
我等等就过去
I'll be out there in a second.

317
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:24,710
好运到此为止
So much for my luck.

318
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,710
- 别动  - 好
- Don't move. - Okay.

319
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,550
我很快回来，想想淫贱的事
I'll be right back. Think dirty thoughts.

320
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:31,550
怎么了，伙计？在哪里？阁楼上吗？
What is it, buddy? Where is it? In the attic?

321
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:36,990
房子在晚上本来就会发出声音  这很正常，我保证
Houses make noises at night. It's normal, I promise.

322
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:40,060
我们旧家不会
Not our old house.

323
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,270
这倒是真的
Well, that's true.

324
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,550
你在哪边听到声音
Tell me where you heard it.

325
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,110
这些小丑是哪里来的？
Where did all of these clowns come from?

326
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,830
我在那边找到的
I found them in there.

327
00:20:57,080 --> 00:20:59,990
怎么有人会有一箱子小丑？
Why would somebody have a box of clowns?

328
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,070
人们有收集怪癖的，伙计
People collect weird things, pal.

329
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,630
我不喜欢这里
I don't like it up here.

330
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:09,350
怎么了？你害怕吗？怕什么？
What's the matter? You scared? What are you scared of?

331
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,420
全部都怕
Everything.

332
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,270
会好的，你要试着少担心一些，孩子
You're gonna get over that. You gotta try to worry less, kiddo.

333
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:19,750
懂吗？
You know?

334
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:23,430
如果你一直害怕，小梅也会怕
If you're scared all the time, Maddy's gonna get scared.

335
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:26,430
你要当好榜样
You gotta set a good example.

336
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,430
你是哥哥，要勇敢，知道吗？
You're the big brother. You gotta be brave, you know?

337
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,100
他妈的！
Holy shit!

338
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,110
怎么了？
What is it?

339
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:37,990
跟我说话
Talk to me.

340
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,470
你为什么徘徊不去？
Why do you linger here?

341
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,510
利用我，我能让你自由，利用我
Use me. I can release you. Use me.

342
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,470
怎么了？
What's going on?

343
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,910
我不知道
I don't know.

344
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,830
艾瑞克，上面怎么了？
Eric, what is going on up there?

345
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:00,110
怎么回事？
What, what, what?

346
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,710
家里有只松鼠
We have a squirrel.

347
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,150
你真是个疯子！
You are such a nut ball!

348
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,990
- 尾巴又大又蓬！  - 吓坏我们了！
- Big, fluffy tail! - You scared us!

349
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,110
吓死人了！
Terrifying!

350
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,110
有啮齿动物，太棒了
Perfect. Rodents.

351
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,790
我明天会设陷阱
I'll set a trap tomorrow.

352
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,110
你抓到它以后会放回森林吗？
After you catch it with the trap, will you release it to the woods?

353
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,390
当然，这样你会比较开心吗，亲爱的？
Yeah, sure. Would that make you feel better, honey?

354
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,950
没抓到它之前我不要睡在上面
I'm not sleeping up there until it's gone.

355
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,980
你在哪里？
Where are you?

356
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:03,390
你是好人吗？
Are you nice?

357
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,230
你怎么去那里的？
How did you get there?

358
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,430
你哭了吗？
Did you cry?

359
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,190
怎么帮你？
Help you how?

360
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,030
但我看不到你
But I can't see you.

361
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,230
你旁边还有谁？
Who else is there with you?

362
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:50,710
葛瑞芬也可以来吗？
Can Griffin come, too?

363
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:58,830
是的，我会很勇敢
Yes, I can be brave.

364
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,990
我要先问妈妈
I have to ask my mommy.

365
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,150
不
No.

366
00:25:24,040 --> 00:25:25,670
我不怕
I'm not afraid.

367
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,900
好
Yes.

368
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:33,670
但你们要怎么过来？
But, how will you get here?

369
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,590
小梅，你在干嘛？
Maddy, what's going on?

370
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,830
他们要来了
They're coming.

371
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,150
谁？
Who is?

372
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,950
谁要来？
Who is coming?

373
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,630
小梅！
Maddy!

374
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,590
快离开电视机前面！
Get away from the TV!

375
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,750
怎么回事？
What's going on?

376
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:27,510
他们来了
They're here.

377
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,710
网站上说可能是电路板的导线松了
It says here it's probably just a loose conductor in the electrical panel.

378
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:52,270
我要找电工
I'm calling an electrician.

379
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:54,270
干嘛付钱给别人？我来就行
Are you gonna pay him for what I can do myself?

380
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:56,510
他们收天价，葛瑞芬帮我就好，对吧？
Those guys charge an arm and a leg. Griff will help. Right, buddy?

381
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:58,750
- 葛瑞芬会帮你修电板？  - 对
- Griff will help you fix an electrical panel? - Yeah.

382
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,030
还有，我找到松鼠进来的地方了
I found out where the squirrel got in, by the way.

383
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,070
屋顶有个洞，我会堵住
There's a hole by the roof line. I'm gonna block it up.

384
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,350
爸爸，我不要吃麦片，我想吃比萨
Daddy, I don't want cereal. I want pizza.

385
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:07,750
早餐就吃？
- Yeah, for breakfast?

386
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:08,950
每餐都要吃！
- For all the time!

387
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,030
一天三次？
Three times a day?

388
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,190
葛瑞芬！我叫你别动我的手机！
Griffin! I told you not to touch my phone!

389
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,460
我没碰你的手机
I didn't touch your phone.

390
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,590
- 那它怎么烧坏了？  - 我怎么知道
- Then why is it fried? - How should I know?

391
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,110
又开始了
Here we go.

392
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:19,310
- 我要新手机  - 是吗？
- I need a new phone. - You do?

393
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:20,590
没手机了，亲爱的
No more phones, honey.

394
00:27:20,760 --> 00:27:23,320
那不是奢侈品，爸爸，是必需品
This isn't a luxury item, Dad. It's a necessity.

395
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:25,310
要是你紧急要联络我怎么办？
What if you need to reach me in an emergency?

396
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,590
我们买不起，宝贝
We can't afford it, honey.

397
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,710
狗屁
That's bullshit.

398
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,590
你为什么这么自私？
What are you being so selfish about?

399
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:30,980
狗屁！
That's bullshit!

400
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:33,390
你想买新手机就要去打工
If you want a new phone, you could get a part-time job.

401
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,150
你找到工作我就会去工作
I'll get a job when you get a job.

402
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,460
嘿，她有工作！
Hey, she has a job!

403
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:37,470
你说什么？
Excuse me?

404
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,110
你们就是她的工作！
You kids are her job!

405
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:42,270
对，而且我做得很糟
Yeah. Which I apparently suck at.

406
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:43,990
我不这么想
I don't think you suck at it.

407
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,830
谢谢你，亲爱的
Thank you, sweetheart.

408
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:50,220
嘿，小梅
Hey, Maddy.

409
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:53,460
你记得昨晚的事吗？
Do you remember last night?

410
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,510
你说“他们来了”
When you said, "They're here"?

411
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,310
那是什么意思？
What did you mean?

412
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,460
谁来了？
Who's here?

413
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,510
我朋友而已
Just my friends.

414
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,150
是吗？
Yeah?

415
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,190
你的想象朋友？
Your pretend friends?

416
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:11,270
不是，是迷路的人，不是想象的，妈妈
No, they're lost people. They're not pretend, Mommy.

417
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,500
那女孩真会给我找麻烦，天啊
That girl's gonna put me in a hole, man.

418
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,190
她被禁足了
She's grounded.

419
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,780
包温法官决定了，至少禁足24小时
Judge Bowen has spoken. For at least 24 hours.

420
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,030
提醒她今晚要照顾你们，好吗？
Remind her she's babysitting tonight, will you?

421
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,870
我讨厌肯洁照顾我们
I hate when Kendra babysits.

422
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,510
她也是，伙计
So does she, pal.

423
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,950
我最好弄陷阱抓松鼠
I think I might get some squirrel traps.

424
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,710
对，好主意
Yeah, that's a good idea.

425
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:36,870
这是什么？
What is this?

426
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:38,540
- 葛瑞芬，放下  - 什么？
- Griffin, put that down. - What is that?

427
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,630
- 放下来  - 那是骨头吗？
- Put that down. - Is that a bone or something?

428
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:42,510
- 对，放下来  - 我看看
- Yeah, just put that down. - Let me see.

429
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:45,240
应该是埋在这里的宠物或是马
I guess this is a buried pet or something. Maybe it's a horse.

430
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,460
说不定是一只猪！
Maybe it's a pig, too! A pig!

431
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,700
你吓到了吗？
Is this freaking you out?

432
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:51,390
- 别这样！别这样！  - 怎么了？
- Stop! Stop! - What's the matter?

433
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,060
够了，放回去
All right, put that back.

434
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,550
- 刷不过  - 抱歉
- That's not going through. - I'm sorry about that.

435
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:02,750
我太太说要取消几张用不到的卡
My wife said she might cancel one of the cards because we don't need them all.

436
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:03,900
没想到真取消了
- I didn't know she did it.

437
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,710
这张不是取消，是刷爆了
- It's not canceled, it's over the limit.

438
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:08,310
- 上面这么说吗？  - 对
- Is that what it says there? - Yep.

439
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,590
好吧，试试这张
Okay, let's try this one.

440
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,140
围裙很漂亮，你有参加工会吗？
Nice apron. Are you in the union?

441
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,590
这里的退休金不错吧？
You have a good pension here, for this?

442
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,900
- 抱歉  - 怎么了？
- Sorry. - Yeah?

443
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,430
这张也“取消”了
This one's "canceled" too.

444
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:28,900
两好球了啊，好吧
Strike two, huh? All right.

445
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,510
嘿，坏事不过三
Hey, third one's the charm.

446
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:31,900
祝你好运
Fingers crossed.

447
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,750
怎么样？没问题了吧？
How are we doing? Are we good?

448
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,590
- 这声音我喜欢  - 没问题了
- I like that sound. - Yeah, you're good.

449
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,230
好
Okay.

450
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:01,710
西谷广场购物中心

451
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,990
该死！葛瑞芬！
Damn it! Griffin!

452
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,750
我要你把漫画拿到楼上去
I asked you to bring these comic books upstairs.

453
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:10,630
我正要拿
- I was just about to do it.

454
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,510
对，我差点摔断脖子
- Yeah, I almost broke my neck.

455
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,910
一定是因为你边走边玩游戏
Because you were walking and playing that game at the same time, I bet.

456
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,710
谢谢你提醒
Thank you.

457
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,180
小梅？
Maddy?

458
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,430
是你吗？
Is that you?

459
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,990
小梅？
Maddy?

460
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,700
小梅
Maddy.

461
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,230
这样不好玩
This isn't funny.

462
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,590
好，大家都到楼下来！
All right, everybody, come downstairs!

463
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,190
- 家庭会议  - 爸！爸！
- Family meeting. - Dad! Dad!

464
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,430
- 走吧！肯洁！  - 爸！我有事跟你说！
- Let's go! Kendra! - Dad! I have to tell you something!

465
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,980
- 外边的花怎么了？  - 我不知道
- What's going on with the flowers out there? - I don't know.

466
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:23,310
你买了比萨？我弄了鸡块
Did you get pizza?- I just made chicken nuggets.

467
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,790
没关系，一起吃
- That's okay. We'll have both.

468
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,140
- 比萨！  - 我的宝贝想吃比萨
- Pizza! - My baby wanted pizza.

469
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,310
放在一起就是鸡块比萨了
You put them together, you got chicken nugget pizza.

470
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,150
爸，刚刚发生了怪事！
Dad, the weirdest thing happened!

471
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,270
- 你干嘛朝我大叫，葛瑞芬？  - 葛瑞芬，小声一点
- Why are you screaming at me, Griffin? - Griffin, you got to tone it down.

472
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:36,150
- 怎么了？  - “怎么了”？我告诉你
- What? - "What?" Here's what.

473
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,260
- 是什么？  - 怎么样？
- What's that? - What do you think of that?

474
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,630
- 不会吧！  - 真的！
- No way! - Yeah, way!

475
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:41,020
- 还有什么吗？  - 别再烦我了
- You know what else? - Now get off my back.

476
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,260
- 谢谢，爸  - 好
- Thank you, Dad. - You got it.

477
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,030
- 爸！你知道吗？  - 你说
- Dad! And guess what? - Yeah.

478
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,790
- 那颗球滚过地板  - 什么？
- The ball rolled across the floor... - What? What?

479
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,630
- 撞进衣橱里  - 嘿，你看！
- knocked into the closet... - Hey, look at this!

480
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:49,950
我买了你想要的遥控直升机
I got you that AR drone you wanted.

481
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,710
- 很棒吧？  - 你没在听我说话！
- Look at that. Isn't that cool? - Dad, you aren't listening to me!

482
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:53,350
- 上面有摄像头  - 真的？
- It's got a camera on it. - It does?

483
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,310
干嘛呢？
- What are you doing?

484
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:55,870
你在干嘛，美女？
- What are you doing, cutie?

485
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,950
看啊，这是你喜欢的耳环
Look at that. These are the ones you liked.

486
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,220
今晚派对可以戴
You can wear them to the party tonight.

487
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,380
爸，我还没说完！
Dad, that's not all!

488
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:01,780
漫画书堆得像座塔！
Then this tower of comic books formed!

489
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,790
我转过来时全都摔到我脸上
When I turned around they blew back at my face!

490
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,550
- 哇  - 就像是凭空出现
- Wow. - They had just appeared out of nowhere...

491
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:07,190
真的？太夸张了！
Really? That's crazy!

492
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,550
- 这不好笑，爸！  - 太有趣了
- It's not funny, Dad! - Yeah, it's hilarious.

493
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,070
你哪来的钱？
How did you pay for this?

494
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,070
你猜呢？我偷来的，我去抢银行
How do you think? I stole it. Robbed a bank.

495
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,230
唉呀
Uh-oh.

496
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,150
唉呀，爸爸糟了！
Uh-oh, Daddy-O!

497
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,670
我们要把这些东西拿回去  你要把东西都退回去
We gotta bring this stuff back. You have to take it back.

498
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,820
- 妈，不要  - 要
- Mom, no. - Yes.

499
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,310
- 我不会去退货  - 爸！
- I'm not bringing anything back. - Dad!

500
00:33:22,520 --> 00:33:23,910
- 葛瑞芬  - 我们应得的
- Griffin. - I think we deserve a treat.

501
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,710
为什么没人听我说？
Why doesn't anyone listen to me?

502
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:29,590
葛瑞芬！天啊！你整个下午都这样
Griffin! Gosh! It's been all afternoon with this.

503
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,350
我要给手机设定密码
Just so you know, I'm putting the passcode on my phone...

504
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,350
- 你就不能用了  - 别把他当敌人
- so you can't get to it. - Please don't antagonize him.

505
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,670
- 爸，我们一定要搬家  - 我们不搬！
- Dad, we have to move. - We're not moving!

506
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:37,820
- 别再说了！  - 艾米
- Now, quit it! - Amy...

507
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,030
我以为小梅才会这样
No, I expect this from Maddy...

508
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,870
我现在觉得他才是小宝宝
but I'm starting to think that he's the baby in the family.

509
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,110
- 给你，妈妈  - 真好
- Here you go, Mommy. - Perfect.

510
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,390
谢谢你，甜心
Thank you, sweetheart.

511
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,750
葛瑞芬，对不起
Griffin, I'm sorry.

512
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,670
这跟我想的不一样
That didn't go as I hoped.

513
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,350
比萨好吃吗？
How's the pizza?

514
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,870
- 不好吃  - 是吗？
- Not good. - No?

515
00:33:55,040 --> 00:33:56,260
不好吃
No.

516
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,230
配鸡块一起吃看看
You got to try it with the nuggets.

517
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,750
这样比较好吃
It's a little better.

518
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:12,950
我真差劲  我叫自己的儿子小不点
I am an awful person. I called my own son a baby.

519
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:17,670
我妈叫我可比这更糟
Well, if it's any consolation, my mom called me a lot worse.

520
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,620
艾瑞克有点不对劲
There's something wrong with him, Eric.

521
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:24,270
不只是焦虑
It's not just the anxiety.

522
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,550
- 他很好  - 他不好
- He's fine. - He's not fine.

523
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,430
他在说离谱的事  还深信不疑
He is saying the craziest things and he believes them.

524
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,070
你想怎么样？  你想让我
All right, what do you want me to do? You want me to...

525
00:34:34,160 --> 00:34:35,110
他会把他交给其他人
I'll take him to someone.

526
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:38,230
可能吗？这不现实
How? I mean, you keep spending money that we don't have.

527
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,270
你为什么这么做？
Why are you doing that?

528
00:34:39,360 --> 00:34:41,470
我在
I mean, what do I got, the illusion of...

529
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,140
幻想？
Spending money?

530
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:45,670
我尽力了
I'm trying to... I'm doing the best I can.

531
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,350
我尽力给你们想要的
I wanna give you guys what you want. I'm trying to...

532
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,070
我知道
I know. I know. I know.

533
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,910
今天不是个好日子，对吧？
Look, look, look, look, it was a bad day, okay?

534
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,790
会好起来的
It'll get better.

535
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,630
- 我去准备  - 好
- I'm gonna go get ready. - Okay.

536
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,110
- 是风车！  - 爸爸！转圈圈！
- It's the windmill! - Daddy! Break my arm!

537
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,310
- 好  - 转圈圈！
- Okay. Okay. - Break my arm! Break my neck!

538
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,110
- 爸爸？  - 转圈！转圈！
- Dad? - Neck! Neck!

539
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,870
爸，松鼠跑进来怎么办？
Dad, what if the squirrel gets in?

540
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:23,990
我封住洞了，像铜墙铁壁
I sealed up the hole. It's tighter than Fort Knox up there.

541
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:24,870
爸爸再见
Bye-bye, Daddy.

542
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,500
- 那干嘛还设陷阱？  - 这样才万无一失
- Then why did you leave the trap? - Insurance. You can't be too safe.

543
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,270
松鼠很狡猾
Squirrels are wily.

544
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,310
- 别担心了  - 再见
- Don't worry about it. - Bye-bye.

545
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,110
- 设定警报，有事打电话  - 我会
- Set the alarm, call us if you need us. - I will.

546
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,830
- 用新手机打给你  - 对，就这样
- Call you on my new phone. - Yeah, you will.

547
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,550
- 好好听姐姐的话  - 妈妈再见
- Be good for your sister. - Bye, Mommy.

548
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,830
- 门要锁好！  - 再见，我们会锁门
- Lock the door! - Bye. We will. Bye.

549
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,310
我不要睡觉！
- I wanna stay up all night!

550
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:41,510
不行，梅蒂森
- No. Madison...

551
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,870
- 整晚不睡！  - 不行，上楼去
- Stay up all night! - No, go upstairs.

552
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:44,230
不要！
No!

553
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,470
好了，这样舒服吗？
All right. All snug?

554
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,020
等一下
Wait.

555
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:51,030
小猪兽说要亲亲
Piggy-corn said she wants more kisses.

556
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,340
她这么说？
She does?

557
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,060
亲几下？
How many?

558
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,340
她说三下
She says three.

559
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,470
- 三下？  - 三下
- Three? - Three.

560
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,350
真的吗？好吧
Sure? Okay.

561
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,870
一、二、三
One, two, three...

562
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,830
二十，九百
20. 900.

563
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,990
我睡不着
I can't fall asleep.

564
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:09,060
为什么？
Why not?

565
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,430
我觉得暴风雨要来了
I think there's a storm coming.

566
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:18,230
盖瑞说你们大学在同一个棒球队
Gary tells me you played ball together in college.

567
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,630
他说你打击很强
He said you had quite the swing.

568
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:21,710
3A级，我现在宝刀未老
Triple-A, but I still do swing with the best of them.

569
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,550
别想歪了，芭芭拉
Don't get any ideas, Barbara.

570
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,180
他可以去打大联盟，他只是谦虚
He could have played in the majors. He's being very modest.

571
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,230
其实我的肩膀不好，没办法
No, I... Bad shoulder, so it wasn't meant to be.

572
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,500
能怎么办呢？
What are you gonna do?

573
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,550
还好你有B计划
Lucky you had a plan B to fall back on.

574
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:35,430
穿西装打领带也很好
There's nothing wrong with a suit and tie.

575
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,980
我一直跟儿子说这样才能付房租
I keep telling my son, it pays the rent.

576
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,830
我也有西装和领带
It's a good thing I have a suit and a tie then.

577
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:41,470
如果你愿意，周一我就能穿上
I can put it on Monday morning if you like.

578
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,150
几点上班？九点？
What time do I start? Nine?

579
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:44,540
他们刚搬到柳镇
They just moved to Willow Point.

580
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,670
我哥在90年代时有间房子在那里
My brother had a house in that development back in the 90s.

581
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,030
因为墓园的事，我们从没去看过他
We'd never visit him because of the cemetery thing.

582
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,150
光想到我就打冷颤
The thought of it just gave me the willies.

583
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,510
什么墓园？
What "cemetery thing"?

584
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:56,510
那个开发区以前是墓园
Just that that development was built on a former cemetery.

585
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,390
- 对，但墓地都迁走了  - 对
- Yeah, but they moved it though. - Yeah.

586
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,860
开发商把坟墓都搬到伯斯顿公园
The developers relocated the whole thing to Broxton Park.

587
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,670
有81万平方米，好多年前的事了
200 acres. This was years ago.

588
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,830
不会吧！整座墓园都搬走？
You're kidding me! They moved the whole cemetery?

589
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,670
中介没告诉你们吗？
The realtor didn't mention it?

590
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:11,470
没有，他们完全没提到
No. Actually, they didn't mention it.

591
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:15,830
把尸体都搬走实在不是什么好事…
Isn't it like, you know, very uncool to move all those bodies and...

592
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:18,500
又不是远古部落的墓地之类的
Well, it's not like it was an ancient tribal burial ground.

593
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:19,510
嗯，我知道
Yeah, I know.

594
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,910
两处开车只要十分钟，亲友还是能去凭吊
It's just 10 minutes away. People can still visit loved ones.

595
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:25,030
而且是搬到好一点的区域
But now it's in a nicer neighborhood.

596
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:26,710
抱歉
I'm sorry.

597
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:57,150
呆子，闭嘴

598
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:37,070
没什么好怕的
There's nothing to be afraid of.

599
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:39,070
救命！
Help!

600
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,030
拜托，救命！
Please, help!

601
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,830
肯洁！
Kendra!

602
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,500
小梅
Maddy.

603
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,150
我们麻烦大了
We're gonna get in big trouble.

604
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,230
葛瑞芬？
Griffin?

605
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,470
葛瑞芬！
Griffin!

606
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:44,390
我好怕！
I'm scared!

607
00:43:44,600 --> 00:43:46,230
不要靠近衣柜
Just stay away from the closet.

608
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:48,350
不要离开我！
Don't leave me!

609
00:43:51,880 --> 00:43:53,150
肯洁！
Kendra!

610
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:55,540
肯洁！
Kendra!

611
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,470
葛瑞芬，开门！
Griffin! Please open the door!

612
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,230
救命！
Please help! Please help me! Please!

613
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:16,710
开门！
Open the door!

614
00:46:57,360 --> 00:46:58,870
怎么回事？
What the hell is that?

615
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:00,390
亲爱的，停车
Honey, stop...

616
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,630
停车
Stop the car.

617
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:04,390
停车
Stop the car.

618
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,710
谁来救救我！
Somebody!

619
00:47:12,880 --> 00:47:15,150
- 葛瑞芬！  - 爸！救命！
- Griff! - Dad! Help!

620
00:47:15,320 --> 00:47:16,300
葛瑞芬！
Griffin!

621
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:19,360
哦，我的天！宝贝你没事吗？
Oh, my God! Baby, are you all right?

622
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,430
- 妈，妈！  - 没事了，宝贝
- Mom, Mom! - Okay, baby.

623
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,510
到底发生什么事了？
What the hell is going on?

624
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:24,350
妈！
Mom!

625
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:25,830
爸，妈
- Dad, Mom...

626
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:26,950
- 怎么…  - 有声音
- What's going... There were voices,

627
00:47:27,120 --> 00:47:29,630
我被关在地下室，树抓住葛瑞芬
I got locked in the basement and the tree grabbed Griffin...

628
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:31,430
慢慢讲，我不懂…你说什么？
- Slow down. I cannot... What did you say?

629
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:33,030
我找不到小梅了！
- I can't find Maddy!

630
00:47:44,680 --> 00:47:45,900
梅蒂森！
Madison!

631
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:48,790
小梅，亲爱的
Maddy, honey...

632
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:54,790
梅蒂森！
Madison!

633
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,140
小梅？
Maddy?

634
00:48:13,280 --> 00:48:14,310
妈妈
Mommy...

635
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:23,710
- 梅蒂森？  - 妈妈
- Madison? - Mommy...

636
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:28,220
妈妈
Mommy.

637
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:33,700
妈？
Mom?

638
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:35,910
妈？
Mom?

639
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,870
妈！
Mom!

640
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:39,190
妈！
Mom!

641
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,270
葛瑞芬，怎么…
Griff. What...

642
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:45,630
妈妈？妈妈？
Mommy? Mommy?

643
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,630
小梅，你在哪里？
Maddy, where are you?

644
00:49:00,320 --> 00:49:02,390
妈妈，妈妈
Mommy. Mommy.

645
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:09,630
爸爸，是你吗？
Daddy, is that you?

646
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:19,710
- 我不懂怎么回事  - 但我们得报警
- I don't even know what happened. - I know, but we have to tell them.

647
00:49:19,880 --> 00:49:21,630
我们要找出真相
We gotta figure out what happened.

648
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:23,350
我们不能报警
We can't call the cops.

649
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,590
你要告诉他们什么？我们的女儿…
What are you gonna tell them? That our daughter got...

650
00:49:25,760 --> 00:49:27,470
- 我不知道怎么回事  - 我会说…
- I don't know what just happened. - I'm gonna tell them...

651
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,870
我们要先弄清楚状况，好吗？
We need to figure out what's going on. Okay?

652
00:49:30,040 --> 00:49:31,870
听我说，听我说
Listen to me. Listen to me.

653
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,020
如果你报警
- If you call the cops

654
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,550
- 警察会怪我们  - 他们不会
they're gonna blame us. - No, they're not

655
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:35,990
- 他们不会相信  - 我们老实说
gonna blame us. We're just gonna tell them what happened.

656
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,510
- 到处都会有记者  - 说实话就好
We're just gonna tell them the truth.I'm gonna tell them the truth.

657
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:40,550
我要跟他们说实话
I'm gonna tell them the truth.

658
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:41,910
我们一起说实话
We're gonna tell them the truth together.

659
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:45,030
我要老实说，我要告诉他们
I'm gonna tell them the truth. What happened, I'm gonna tell them.

660
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,630
但我们不知道实话是什么，亲爱的
But we don't know what the truth is, honey.

661
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,390
艾瑞克，我们需要帮忙
Eric, we have to call somebody.

662
00:49:52,080 --> 00:49:54,990
一定有人会相信我们
There's gotta be somebody who's gonna believe us.

663
00:49:56,800 --> 00:50:00,150
超自然研究部

664
00:50:00,320 --> 00:50:02,270
葛瑞芬最早发现事情不太对劲
Griffin was the first one to notice things.

665
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:06,470
有声音跟一些东西
Noises... and just things.

666
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:10,950
我们以为是他乱说
We thought he was making it up.

667
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,070
对不起，孩子
I'm sorry, buddy.

668
00:50:14,560 --> 00:50:15,870
我们不知道还能找谁
We didn't know where else to go.

669
00:50:16,120 --> 00:50:17,870
你来这里是对的
No, you did the right thing coming here.

670
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:19,830
我在这里念书的时候
When I was a student here

671
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,190
听过关于这个部门的疯狂传闻
this office had the craziest reputation.

672
00:50:22,440 --> 00:50:24,310
我想现在还是一样
I think we still do.

673
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:26,420
请问你丈夫在哪里？
May I ask where your husband is?

674
00:50:26,600 --> 00:50:28,670
他在家陪大女儿肯洁
He's at home with Kendra, our oldest.

675
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:30,790
我们不想让小梅一个人
We don't wanna leave Maddy alone.

676
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,830
上次和她接触是在她消失后吗？
The last time you had contact with her was after she disappeared?

677
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:38,470
只有一次，透过电视机
Just the one time, through the television set.

678
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,980
抱歉，我知道这听起来很不正常
I'm sorry... I hear how crazy this sounds.

679
00:50:41,160 --> 00:50:42,630
我知道一定很可笑
I know I must sound ridiculous.

680
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,550
不会，一点也不疯狂
No, it doesn't. It doesn't sound crazy at all.

681
00:50:45,720 --> 00:50:47,230
- 是我的错  - 不是的
- It's my fault. - No, it is not.

682
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:50,750
看着我，不是你的错
Look at me. It is not your fault.

683
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,550
你为什么觉得是你的错？
Why do you think it's your fault?

684
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,310
我把她一个人留在那里
I left her alone.

685
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,910
我知道我不应该那样
I knew I shouldn't have.

686
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:00,310
但我很害怕
But I was scared.

687
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,910
你当然会害怕
Of course you were scared.

688
00:51:04,240 --> 00:51:06,750
你一定要把我妹妹救回来
You have to get my sister back.

689
00:51:06,920 --> 00:51:08,510
你一定要
You have to.

690
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,590
你做得到吗？
Can you do that?

691
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,110
我会试试看
I can try.

692
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:34,070
就是那台电视
That's the TV...

693
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,910
小梅的手就压在那里
where Maddy's hands were pressed against.

694
00:51:39,080 --> 00:51:44,270
葛瑞芬在这座楼梯第一次被树抓住
This is the staircase that Griffin was first grabbed by the tree.

695
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:46,270
可能和小梅的事有关
It's probably something to do with Maddy.

696
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:48,390
还有我们在这边会被电到
And then there's that. That's a little shocker.

697
00:51:48,560 --> 00:51:49,870
你们想吃三明治吗？
You guys want some sandwiches or something?

698
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,550
- 不用了  - 我要开始录了
- It won't be necessary. - I'm gonna start recording.

699
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:53,350
- 可以吗？  - 可以
- Is that cool? - Yeah.

700
00:51:53,520 --> 00:51:55,110
请便
Knock yourself out.

701
00:51:58,280 --> 00:51:59,260
这是实心的墙
That's solid wall.

702
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:03,140
我又戳又敲的试过无数次了
I've poked and prodded about a hundred times, so...

703
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,870
但你们觉得她是从这边被拉走的？
But you think she got pulled through there somehow?

704
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:08,350
我们不知道
We don't know.

705
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:11,670
你们觉得这是某种神秘通道吗？
What do you think, it's like a magic portal?

706
00:52:12,480 --> 00:52:13,620
我说了不知道
I just said we don't know.

707
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:15,150
这给我好吗？
Do you mind if I hold onto that?

708
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:16,830
她回来后可能会想要
Till she gets back.

709
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:19,590
我不希望混乱中弄丢了
I don't want it, you know, lost in the shuffle.

710
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:21,350
没问题
No problem.

711
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:29,510
我最近拍到很不可思议的事
I shot a pretty amazing occurrence recently.

712
00:52:29,680 --> 00:52:33,150
在奈波维尔一间老房子的钢琴椅
We were at this old house in Naperville, and a piano bench...

713
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,030
在客厅移动了三米
rolled 10 feet across the parlor floor.

714
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:38,150
花了七小时的时间
It took seven hours.

715
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,910
- 移动三米？  - 对
- To roll 10 feet? - Yeah.

716
00:52:41,080 --> 00:52:44,750
我用特殊缩时摄影机拍到的
I used a special time-lapse setting on my camera.

717
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:47,630
成功搞定
So, nailed the whole thing.

718
00:52:48,040 --> 00:52:50,830
肉眼是捕捉不到这种事的，所以…
You can't catch that kind of a thing with the naked eye, so I...

719
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,470
你的缩时摄影机拍到了吗？
Did you get all that on your time-lapse camera?

720
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,710
根据我的经验
From my experience...

721
00:53:07,880 --> 00:53:11,150
这应该不是典型的闹鬼
this doesn't seem to be a classic haunting.

722
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:13,870
你们的情况
What you have here...

723
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,750
应该比较接近恶灵入侵
is probably closer to a poltergeist intrusion.

724
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:19,550
有什么不一样？
What's the difference?

725
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:22,150
鬼魂通常是无害的幻影
Ghosts usually appear as harmless apparitions.

726
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:24,150
但是恶灵
Whereas poltergeists...

727
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,260
会吵闹、攻击人
They're noisy, they lash out...

728
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,870
他们很暴力，会移动物品
they're violent, they move objects.

729
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:34,630
会突然出现，突然消失
It comes, and then it can just as suddenly go away.

730
00:53:35,480 --> 00:53:37,310
然后把小梅也带走？
And take Maddy with it?

731
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:31,910
- 你没事吧？  - 没事
- You okay? - Yeah.

732
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,470
怎么了？
What's going on?

733
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,150
我那时候应该在家的
I should've been... home.

734
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,630
- 我应该在家  - 别这样，好吗？
- I should've been home. - Don't do this, okay?

735
00:54:42,840 --> 00:54:44,710
你现在不能崩溃
I can't lose you now.

736
00:54:45,440 --> 00:54:48,110
如果我失去信心
If I say it's not gonna be okay...

737
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:50,660
你要告诉我“一定会没事，亲爱的”
you have to say, "Of course it is, sweetheart."

738
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:55,230
不然我们撑不过去的
Otherwise, we're not gonna get through this.

739
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,580
房子扫瞄完了，现在系统要联机
We've done a scan of the house, and now we're wiring into your system.

740
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,630
这样如果小梅再跟你们接触
So if Maddy tries to make contact again...

741
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:16,630
我们会比较了解情况
we'll have a better sense of what's going on...

742
00:55:16,800 --> 00:55:18,590
也许能把她带回来
which may help us get her back.

743
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:19,870
可以吗？
Does that sound okay?

744
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:22,350
听起来很好，可以快一点吗？
That sounds great. Can we do it a little faster?

745
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:24,950
小心
Watch out.

746
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,550
我问你
Let me ask you something.

747
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,830
你爸爸
Your dad...

748
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,790
有一阵子没工作了吧？
he's been out of work a while, right?

749
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,550
我想是的
Yeah, I guess.

750
00:55:39,120 --> 00:55:41,950
没关系，没有人是完美的
That's okay. Nobody's perfect.

751
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,390
我只是在想
I was just thinking about it.

752
00:55:45,760 --> 00:55:48,630
如果他想在短时间里发财
If he really wanted to make some money quick...

753
00:55:48,800 --> 00:55:51,430
恶灵绑架案好像不错
a poltergeist abduction isn't a bad idea.

754
00:55:52,320 --> 00:55:54,510
就算最后是假的也没关系
Even if it turned out to be a fake.

755
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:57,630
只要公开以后就能上电视
You go public with it, you do some TV appearances.

756
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:00,030
- 还会有真人秀  - 你够了没？
- You get your own reality show. - Would you stop?

757
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,550
那不是很赞吗？
How cool would that be?

758
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,510
我们不想要真人秀
We don't want a reality show.

759
00:56:04,680 --> 00:56:06,230
我们只要小梅回来
We just want Maddy back.

760
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:11,790
你很厉害，小孩
You're good, kid.

761
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,510
非常厉害
Very good.

762
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:18,910
你在衣柜后面也装了热传感器吗？
Did you set up the heat sensor in the back of the closet yet?

763
00:56:19,080 --> 00:56:20,270
还没
No, not yet.

764
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,510
我不知道怎么固定这东西
I didn't know how to fasten that thing.

765
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:25,670
用螺丝固定，伯伊
Screw it, Boyd.

766
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:28,510
好的
Okay...

767
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:30,630
老大
Captain.

768
00:56:41,480 --> 00:56:42,990
“用螺丝固定”
"Screw it."

769
00:57:50,720 --> 00:57:52,590
不会吧
Gotta be kidding me.

770
00:58:23,360 --> 00:58:24,790
该死的
God damn it.

771
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:05,220
找到了
Gotcha.

772
00:59:12,000 --> 00:59:13,670
无线温度计

773
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:40,590
不要！
No!

774
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,510
楼上都弄好了吗？
You all done up there?

775
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:15,380
好了
Yeah.

776
01:00:15,560 --> 01:00:17,670
热传感器装在衣柜里了吗？
The heat sensor is in the closet?

777
01:00:21,120 --> 01:00:21,830
算是
Sort of.

778
01:00:23,120 --> 01:00:25,790
伯伊，你认真一点可以吗？
Boyd, I really need you to take this more seriously, okay?

779
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:27,110
可以吗？
Okay?

780
01:00:27,280 --> 01:00:29,030
- 好  - 很好
- Okay. - Okay, good.

781
01:00:31,360 --> 01:00:33,110
我的意思是
I think what I was saying is...

782
01:00:33,280 --> 01:00:35,870
有些人相信现实分成很多层
some people believe there are different levels of reality.

783
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:37,310
我们在实体面
We're on a physical plane...

784
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,870
但死亡后，精神会到另一个层面
but when we die our spirits go to another level.

785
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,510
所谓天界或是灵界
An astral plane or a spiritual plane.

786
01:00:44,680 --> 01:00:48,950
像是同时在这里却又不在这里
Which is sort of here and not here at the same time.

787
01:00:51,080 --> 01:00:52,220
这样说吧
Okay...

788
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:55,150
看这边
Look at this.

789
01:00:59,000 --> 01:01:01,870
好，然后这个
Okay. Now this...

790
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:03,750
谢谢你，珀威尔博士
Thank you, Dr. Powell.

791
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:06,670
我们在这个物理层
This is us here. In the physical level.

792
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,350
但小梅却被拉到这边
And somehow Maddy got pulled here.

793
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,550
在这里，却又不在这里
Here and not here at the same time.

794
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,510
正是如此
Exactly.

795
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:24,670
得有人去那里告诉她怎么回来
Then someone should go in there and show her the way back here.

796
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,350
这是个好主意
That's actually not a bad idea.

797
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,030
我敢肯定…
I'm fairly certain...

798
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,590
我们听不见她，但她能听见我们
Maddy is able to hear us a lot better than we can hear her.

799
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:42,780
所以这个设备可以过滤干扰
So this equipment is going to filter out all the interference...

800
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:46,430
让我们比较能和她沟通
so that we'll be better able to communicate with her.

801
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:47,950
我们要怎么开始？
How do we start?

802
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,550
只要叫她就好
You just call out to her.

803
01:01:54,280 --> 01:01:55,340
好
Okay.

804
01:02:01,200 --> 01:02:02,590
小梅？
Maddy?

805
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,540
梅蒂森，我是妈妈
Madison, it's Mommy.

806
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,700
你听得见吗？
Can you hear me?

807
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,880
梅蒂森，我们要跟你说话
Madison, we wanna talk to you.

808
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,550
你要让我们知道你很安全
We just want you to let us know that you're safe.

809
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:24,310
你在这里吗？
Are you with us?

810
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,230
小梅，我们要听见你的声音  好吗，亲爱的？
Maddy, we need to hear your voice, okay, sweetheart?

811
01:02:29,560 --> 01:02:31,750
你跟妈妈打招呼好不好？
Can you say hello to Mommy?

812
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:40,740
你在这里吗？
Are you with us?

813
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:43,990
我们都好想你
We all miss you so much.

814
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:55,590
妈妈真的好想好想你
Mommy misses you so, so, so, so, so, so much.

815
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:00,590
嗨，妈妈
Hi, Mommy.

816
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,670
嗨，宝贝！
Hi, baby!

817
01:03:02,880 --> 01:03:04,270
嘿，亲爱的，爸爸也在
Hey, honey. Daddy's here, too.

818
01:03:04,440 --> 01:03:06,590
我们都在等你，亲爱的
We're all waiting for you, honey.

819
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:08,790
爸爸，你在哪里？
Daddy, where are you?

820
01:03:08,960 --> 01:03:12,070
我们在家，你要回来我们这里，亲爱的
We're home. We need you to come back to us now, honey.

821
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,390
我试过了，可是我找不到你们
I tried, but I can't find you.

822
01:03:16,600 --> 01:03:18,900
好，你要继续试，知道吗？
Okay, okay, okay. Keep on trying, okay?

823
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:22,070
因为我们就在这里，你快到了！
Because we are right here. You're so close!

824
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:26,740
妈妈？妈妈？
Mommy? Mommy?

825
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:28,910
爸爸，是你吗？
Daddy, is that you?

826
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:30,300
爸爸在这里，亲爱的
No, Daddy's right here, honey.

827
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,830
有人在她旁边！谁在那边，宝贝？
There's somebody with her! Who's with you, baby?

828
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,470
- 爸爸在这  - 谁在你旁边？
- Daddy's right here. - Who is with you?

829
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:37,270
他们都在我旁边
They're all around me.

830
01:03:43,200 --> 01:03:46,190
小梅！小梅？小梅？
Maddy! Maddy? Maddy?

831
01:03:51,480 --> 01:03:53,190
- 小梅，你听得见吗？  - 怎么了？
- Maddy, can you hear us? - What's going on?

832
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:57,630
妈妈，妈妈
Mommy. Mommy.

833
01:03:58,440 --> 01:03:59,110
爸爸？
Daddy?

834
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:01,260
小梅！
Maddy!

835
01:04:02,000 --> 01:04:02,670
梅蒂森？
Madison?

836
01:04:05,400 --> 01:04:07,350
爸爸，我好怕
Daddy, I'm scared.

837
01:04:12,520 --> 01:04:13,350
小梅！
Maddy!

838
01:04:13,520 --> 01:04:14,310
等一下！
No, wait!

839
01:04:14,480 --> 01:04:15,510
包温先生，不！
Mr. Bowen, no!

840
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:55,900
小梅
Maddy.

841
01:05:11,920 --> 01:05:14,030
小梅，是我，亲爱的
Maddy, it's me, honey.

842
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:33,230
把她还给我！把她还给我！
Give her back! Give her back!

843
01:05:34,920 --> 01:05:36,470
把她还来！你们不能抓走她！
Give her back! You can't have her!

844
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:40,390
出去！
Get out!

845
01:06:08,480 --> 01:06:10,470
你没事吧？有被打到吗？
You okay? Did you get hit?

846
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:11,780
没有？你还好吗？
No? You okay?

847
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:12,790
都没事吧？
Everything okay?

848
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:13,870
那是什么？
What is that?

849
01:06:14,040 --> 01:06:15,910
你没事，艾瑞克！
You're okay. Eric!

850
01:06:16,080 --> 01:06:16,950
艾瑞克
Eric.

851
01:06:17,120 --> 01:06:18,260
发生什么事了？
What happened?

852
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,310
包温先生，那里…
That, Mr. Bowen...

853
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,110
就是能带回小梅的地方
that's Maddy's way out.

854
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,660
但我们需要协助才能找到她
But I think we're gonna need some help in getting her there.

855
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,860
哪一种协助？
What kind of help?

856
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,710
你听过卡利根伯克吗？
Have you ever heard of Carrigan Burke?

857
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,310
不会是他吧
No effing way.

858
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,190
你的手怎么了？
What happened to your hand?

859
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:37,550
97年在密歇根州布兰查德
Blanchard, Michigan. '97.

860
01:07:38,720 --> 01:07:42,190
屋顶储藏室闹鬼，灵魂不愿离开
Haunted root cellar. Spirit didn't wanna leave.

861
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,870
还好他们不是全部都很凶
Luckily, they're not all that angry.

862
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:47,500
我们的很凶
Ours is.

863
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,030
- 小子，还好吗？  - 没事
- Buddy, you okay? - Yeah.

864
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:52,070
他来了
Guy's here.

865
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:53,590
你们一定是包温夫妇
You must be the Bowens.

866
01:07:53,760 --> 01:07:55,510
你一定是那位大师了
And you must be the cavalry.

867
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,190
珀威尔博士
Dr. Powell.

868
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:05,070
我们都准备好了，随时可开始
We're all set up if you wanna get started.

869
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:12,780
你好
Hey.

870
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,750
你是我的偶像，我是伯伊，幸会
Big fan. My name's Boyd. Nice to meet you.

871
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:16,900
拿着
Here.

872
01:08:21,960 --> 01:08:23,550
他知道我们不上电视吧？
He knows this can't be on TV, right?

873
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:26,070
我告诉过他了
No, I told him that.

874
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:28,950
那他为什么还愿意来？
So why is he doing it?

875
01:08:29,160 --> 01:08:31,150
那就是阴阳交界处？
This was the area of bilocation?

876
01:08:31,760 --> 01:08:33,430
那边掉出一张桌子
A table fell out of there.

877
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,350
我差点被压扁
I was almost crushed.

878
01:08:37,920 --> 01:08:39,670
情况还好吗？
Is everything all right?

879
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:42,030
还好的话就不需要我了
If it was, I wouldn't be here.

880
01:08:49,960 --> 01:08:53,350
这间房子不干净
This house is not clean.

881
01:08:54,280 --> 01:08:55,260
什么？
What?

882
01:09:40,040 --> 01:09:43,510
好，重要的事先处理
All right, first things first.

883
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,670
告诉我小梅的一些事
I want you to tell me a little bit about Maddy.

884
01:09:46,360 --> 01:09:49,900
你们会觉得她比较奇怪吗？
Did you ever feel that she was a little bit off?

885
01:09:50,120 --> 01:09:51,180
- 奇怪？  - 对
- Off? - Yeah.

886
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:53,350
- 什么意思？  - 怎么样算是奇怪？
- What do you mean? - How do you mean, "Off"?

887
01:09:53,520 --> 01:09:56,910
你听过她和不存在的东西说话吗？
Did you ever hear her talking to things that weren't there?

888
01:09:57,080 --> 01:10:00,390
对，她有想象朋友，那很正常
Yeah, she has imaginary friends, but that's normal.

889
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:05,350
我想他是说小梅可能有这种天赋
I think what he's trying to say is that Maddy might have been born with a gift.

890
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:08,110
我不会说是“天赋”，但没关系
That's not the word I'd use, but all right.

891
01:10:08,640 --> 01:10:12,030
你是说她能和鬼说话？
You mean she can talk to ghosts?

892
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,030
她才六岁
She's six years old.

893
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:17,030
代表她的生命力还很纯净
Which means that her life force is at its purest...

894
01:10:17,200 --> 01:10:20,470
不会批判或是愤世嫉俗
without judgment or cynicism.

895
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:23,550
不然他们当初怎么会找上她？
Why do you think they reached out to her in the first place?

896
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,470
他们可没找你们其他人
They didn't reach out to any of you.

897
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,270
你一直说“他们”，他们是谁？
You keep saying "they." Who are "they"?

898
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,390
布鲁克告诉我这里以前是墓园
Brooke tells me that this development was built on a cemetery.

899
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:37,710
- 是吗？  - 爸，真的？
- Right? - Dad, really?

900
01:10:37,920 --> 01:10:40,480
冷静点，是以前的事了
Calm down. It's a former cemetery. Former.

901
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:42,430
他们很早就把尸体移走了
They moved the bodies a long time ago.

902
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,160
- 他们…  - 把尸体搬到更好的地方
- They relocated... - They moved them to a nicer neighborhood.

903
01:10:45,320 --> 01:10:47,110
我想他们没有
I don't think that they are.

904
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:50,790
我想他们只是告诉大家他们搬了
I think they just told people they moved the cemetery.

905
01:10:50,960 --> 01:10:53,260
应该只是把墓碑移走吧
I think they just moved the headstones.

906
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,510
尸体都还在这里？
And they left the bodies?

907
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,900
哦，天哪
Oh, my God.

908
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:03,430
我们要应付的不只是几只恶鬼
This isn't just a few pissed off spirits that we're dealing with.

909
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,140
这跟我过去感应到的都不一样
This is unlike anything that I've ever felt before.

910
01:11:07,360 --> 01:11:10,070
比较像是一群暴民
This is... It's more like a mob.

911
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:13,590
他们遭受了非常不公平的对待
They suffered a terrible injustice...

912
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:18,750
愤怒与沮丧形成一股强大的新力量
and that anger and frustration has created a new, more powerful force.

913
01:11:19,960 --> 01:11:21,750
就是恶灵
The poltergeist.

914
01:11:21,960 --> 01:11:24,470
他们被困住，绝望不已
They are trapped and they are desperate.

915
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,180
你女儿是他们脱离炼狱的门票
And your daughter is their ticket out of this purgatory.

916
01:11:28,360 --> 01:11:30,430
他们想拿她怎么样？
What do they want with her?

917
01:11:30,600 --> 01:11:33,350
他们要用她当作离开黑暗的灯笼
They want her to be their lantern in the darkness.

918
01:11:34,160 --> 01:11:36,150
引领他们走向光亮
To lead them into the light.

919
01:11:40,720 --> 01:11:43,230
如果她进入光亮会怎么样？
What happens if she goes into the light?

920
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:46,350
如果她走进去就没办法回来了
There's no getting her back if she does that.

921
01:11:46,680 --> 01:11:49,060
他这么说并不表示…
Just because he said that, it doesn't mean...

922
01:11:49,960 --> 01:11:51,710
那是真的，懂吗？
that's true, okay?

923
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:55,830
你说的每句话都不合理
Nothing you've said makes sense to me.

924
01:11:56,000 --> 01:11:58,750
现在的每件事也都不合理啊
And everything else does, right?

925
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:01,380
衣柜、大树、天花板上闷烧的洞
The closet, the tree, the smoldering hole in the ceiling.

926
01:12:01,560 --> 01:12:04,070
那些都很合理，只有我在鬼扯
All that makes sense to you, but I'm full of crap.

927
01:12:04,240 --> 01:12:06,190
我不知道，可以吗？我不知道
I don't know, okay? I don't know.

928
01:12:07,880 --> 01:12:12,860
我们只希望女儿回来
We just want our daughter back, okay? We just want our daughter back.

929
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,750
艾瑞克，我了解你的感受
Eric, I know exactly how you feel.

930
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:15,900
你怎么会了解？
I don't know if you do.

931
01:12:16,080 --> 01:12:19,430
我这辈子每天都有这种感觉
I've felt it every single day of my entire life.

932
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:24,030
不知该相信什么，但你该相信
It is hard to know what to believe in, but I am here to help.

933
01:12:24,200 --> 01:12:26,310
我是来帮忙你们的，对不？
You believe that, don't you?

934
01:12:31,120 --> 01:12:32,100
好吧
Okay.

935
01:12:34,760 --> 01:12:37,190
我们只能靠你了，动手吧
You're all I've got, so let's do it.

936
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:02,230
每个人都带着定位追踪器
Everybody gets a GPS tracker.

937
01:13:02,400 --> 01:13:05,990
万一情况不对
This is gonna tell us where you are, anytime...

938
01:13:06,160 --> 01:13:08,910
我们才能知道你们的位置
in case anything gets weird.

939
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:11,790
这要怎么弄？
What am I supposed to do with this?

940
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,470
放进口袋里就好
Just put it in your pocket.

941
01:13:28,360 --> 01:13:29,830
很奇怪，对不对？
Weird, right?

942
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:31,190
是啊
Yeah.

943
01:13:31,800 --> 01:13:32,860
他的腿怎么了？
What's with the leg?

944
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:35,070
我不知道
I don't know.

945
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,070
告诉我怎么操纵好吗？
Can you show me how to fly this thing?

946
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:39,950
好
Okay.

947
01:13:40,120 --> 01:13:42,550
有点复杂，你要让我来吗？
It's kind of complicated. Do you want me to fly it?

948
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,190
我可以搞定
I can handle it.

949
01:13:46,560 --> 01:13:49,270
你们可以问我，不必盯着我的腿
You gonna ask me about it, or just stare at my leg the whole day?

950
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,390
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what you're talking about.

951
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,990
我们把话讲开吧
Let's just get this over with, shall we?

952
01:13:55,200 --> 01:13:56,590
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

953
01:13:56,760 --> 01:13:59,470
不，我们不想看，这太奇怪了
No, no, no. We don't need to see that. That's weird.

954
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,310
- 你怎么了？  - 你怎么了？
What happened to you?

955
01:14:02,480 --> 01:14:04,230
2003年在葡萄牙
Portugal, 2003.

956
01:14:04,400 --> 01:14:06,670
布萨科森林里的修道院
There was a monastery in the forest of Bussaco...

957
01:14:06,840 --> 01:14:09,030
有一个很难搞的灵
with a particularly nasty entity.

958
01:14:09,200 --> 01:14:11,390
你甩掉他了吗？
And you got rid of it?

959
01:14:11,720 --> 01:14:14,550
他带着我的一块腿肉走的
Not before it took a piece of my leg with it.

960
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,830
好，谢谢你的分享，真恶心
Okay, thank you for that. That's gross.

961
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,270
我要去吐了，多谢
I'm gonna go throw up. Thanks.

962
01:14:23,640 --> 01:14:24,910
那边又是怎么回事？
And what about that one?

963
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:28,950
这个故事很精彩
That's a good story.

964
01:14:29,120 --> 01:14:32,110
这件事结束后我再告诉你，好吗？
Let's save that for after this is all over, shall we?

965
01:14:32,720 --> 01:14:34,630
如果你没死的话
Assuming you don't die.

966
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,540
好
Okay.

967
01:14:41,200 --> 01:14:43,550
- 你干嘛这样？  - 哪样？
- Why do you do that? - What?

968
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,790
说些当年勇的故事
You tell your old war stories...

969
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,870
好像你是个老家伙一样
and you make yourself sound like an old man.

970
01:14:48,080 --> 01:14:49,220
干这行就是这样
Comes with the territory.

971
01:14:49,640 --> 01:14:51,430
我们老得比别人快
We age in dog years.

972
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,190
你有小孩吗，伯克先生？
Do you have kids, Mr. Burke?

973
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:54,750
可惜没有
Sadly, no.

974
01:14:54,920 --> 01:14:57,630
我太太觉得做这行不适合有小孩
My wife didn't think it was a good idea given our line of work.

975
01:14:57,840 --> 01:14:59,390
不只是因为工作而已
It wasn't just the work.

976
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,470
- 你们两个以前…  - 很短暂
- The two of you were... - Briefly.

977
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:06,070
我们又年轻又傻
We were young and stupid.

978
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:07,510
只有一个人傻
Only one of us was stupid.

979
01:15:07,680 --> 01:15:10,750
别自责了，我那时候真的很帅
Don't be so hard on yourself. I was irresistible back then.

980
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,870
我去检查楼上的数据
I'm gonna go check the readings upstairs.

981
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,500
她也是这样逃离我们的婚姻的
And she goes, just like she fled our marriage.

982
01:15:15,680 --> 01:15:19,750
投入学术的怀抱，安全稳定的学术
Straight into the arms of academia. Safe, stable academia.

983
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:21,590
- 但还是很想我  - 我没有
- Still misses me though. - No, I don't.

984
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,790
你有，一点点
You do, a little.

985
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:24,180
一点都没有
No, not even a little bit.

986
01:15:24,360 --> 01:15:26,990
她忘记我有感应能力
She forgets I can sense these things.

987
01:15:27,160 --> 01:15:28,790
我有特殊能力，你知道的
I have special powers, you know.

988
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,110
也没那么特殊
They're not that special.

989
01:15:33,000 --> 01:15:33,980
你还好吗？
You all right?

990
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:36,180
我有点害怕
I'm a little scared.

991
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:37,870
是哦
Yeah.

992
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:39,230
我也是
Me too.

993
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:41,910
我们要怎么办？
What are we gonna do about that?

994
01:15:42,920 --> 01:15:44,060
我不知道
I don't know.

995
01:15:45,160 --> 01:15:46,300
专心想小梅？
Think about Maddy?

996
01:15:46,640 --> 01:15:47,860
试试看吧
Let's try that.

997
01:15:54,080 --> 01:15:55,910
比较不害怕了吗？
Feeling less scared?

998
01:15:56,080 --> 01:15:57,430
不，其实没有
No, not really.

999
01:15:58,360 --> 01:15:59,580
嗯，我也没有
Yeah, me neither.

1000
01:16:02,240 --> 01:16:03,460
但我觉得比较有勇气了
I feel a little braver, though.

1001
01:16:04,640 --> 01:16:05,990
我也是
Me too.

1002
01:16:06,560 --> 01:16:07,870
我们好了
We're good.

1003
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,110
布鲁克，开始录像！
Brooke, video's up!

1004
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,550
- 走吧  - 我们这边都好了
- Let's go. - We're all set to go down here.

1005
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:16,070
肯洁，把袋子里的皮带丢给我
Kendra, would you ever throw me that belt that's in that bag there?

1006
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:20,910
好，我们先说清楚
All right, just so we're all clear.

1007
01:16:21,800 --> 01:16:25,630
第一，绳子是我们进出的桥梁
First, we use the rope to bridge the way in to the way out.

1008
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:30,580
里面有一套不一样的规则
The rules are different in there.

1009
01:16:30,760 --> 01:16:34,030
没有上下之分
There is no up, there is no down...

1010
01:16:34,200 --> 01:16:35,630
也没有直线
and there are no straight lines.

1011
01:16:37,480 --> 01:16:40,350
所以我们要自己画一条
Which is why we have to make one.

1012
01:16:41,040 --> 01:16:42,990
这条绳子是我们的生命线
This rope is our lifeline.

1013
01:16:43,200 --> 01:16:47,870
如果我们放手就找不到回来的路
If we let go of it, we'll never find our way back.

1014
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:52,270
成功了！
It worked!

1015
01:16:57,560 --> 01:16:58,950
等我们都弄好了
Once we've done that...

1016
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,390
就派直升机去找小梅
we send the drone in to get eyes on Maddy.

1017
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,790
稳住，要稳住了
Keep it steady, now. Keep it steady.

1018
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,790
稳住直升机，葛瑞芬
Keep it steady there, Griffin.

1019
01:19:45,560 --> 01:19:46,750
是小梅！
Maddy!

1020
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,150
小梅？
Maddy?

1021
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:51,300
妈妈
Mommy.

1022
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,150
妈妈？
Mommy?

1023
01:19:53,320 --> 01:19:54,230
小梅
Maddy.

1024
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:55,950
妈妈？
Mommy?

1025
01:19:56,720 --> 01:19:57,830
是小梅吗？
Maddy?

1026
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,390
- 梅蒂森，听到吗？  - 妈妈
- Madison, can you hear me? - Mommy.

1027
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:01,510
梅蒂森！梅蒂森？
Madison! Madison?

1028
01:20:03,480 --> 01:20:08,070
梅蒂森，宝贝，小梅，甜心，我是妈妈
Madison, honey. Maddy, sweetheart, it's Mommy.

1029
01:20:08,280 --> 01:20:09,150
妈妈？
- Mommy?

1030
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:10,030
小梅？
- Maddy?

1031
01:20:10,920 --> 01:20:11,830
爸爸？
Daddy?

1032
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,880
梅蒂森！梅蒂森！
Madison! Madison!

1033
01:20:20,720 --> 01:20:23,230
- 放手！让我进去  - 听我说，艾瑞克
- No! I'm going in. - Listen to me, Eric.

1034
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,470
- 我是妈妈，一定要去  - 妈，不行！
- I am her mother. I have to go. - Mom, you can't!

1035
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:26,830
你不能进去！
You're not going in!

1036
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,750
她太接近光了，我进去带她出来
She's too close to the light. I gotta go in and get her out.

1037
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:31,750
不，我去，你去没用，她不跟陌生人走
No, I'm going. You can't go. She won't come to a stranger.

1038
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:33,060
你没有经验
You've never done this before.

1039
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:35,390
- 你不知道怎么应付  - 好，那我去！
- You have no idea what you're dealing with. - All right, I'm going!

1040
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:37,150
葛瑞芬

1041
01:20:37,320 --> 01:20:39,950
家庭问题以后再解决，先带她出来
Sort all this out in family therapy. We've got to get her out of there.

1042
01:20:40,120 --> 01:20:42,270
大家别吵了！葛瑞芬到楼上了
Wait, everyone, stop! Griffin is already upstairs.

1043
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:45,200
葛瑞芬！哦，我的天哪！葛瑞芬！
Griff! Oh, my God! Griff!

1044
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:46,740
葛瑞芬！
Griffin!

1045
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:51,430
葛瑞芬！
Griffin!

1046
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:54,350
我不应该留下她一个人的
I should have never left her alone.

1047
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:56,350
不要！
No!

1048
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,840
葛瑞芬！不要！
Griffin! No!

1049
01:21:06,880 --> 01:21:08,670
葛瑞芬！
Griffin!

1050
01:21:09,360 --> 01:21:10,670
葛瑞芬！
Griffin!

1051
01:21:11,920 --> 01:21:13,350
不要！
No!

1052
01:21:14,120 --> 01:21:17,710
去楼下！抓住绳子！
Go downstairs! Grab ahold of the rope!

1053
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:21,710
我发出信号你们就用力拉！
When I give you the signal, pull with all your might!

1054
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,710
如果没用怎么办？
What if it doesn't work?

1055
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:24,710
艾米
Amy.

1056
01:21:24,880 --> 01:21:26,190
亲爱的
Sweetheart...

1057
01:21:26,800 --> 01:21:28,630
会成功的
it's gonna work.

1058
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,300
这不能失败！
This better work!

1059
01:21:36,720 --> 01:21:38,550
你说你能跟这些东西说话，对吗？
You said you could talk to these things, right?

1060
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:41,380
告诉他们该放小梅回来了！
Tell them it's time to let Maddy go!

1061
01:21:43,240 --> 01:21:44,630
我全靠你了！
I'm counting on you!

1062
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,160
这个小孩没有伤害你们
This child has done you no harm.

1063
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,110
她也没有口出恶言
She speaks none harm.

1064
01:22:09,480 --> 01:22:10,750
等一下
Wait.

1065
01:22:12,600 --> 01:22:13,430
等一下
Wait.

1066
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:16,750
不，他离开画面了，找不到他了
No, no, no. He's off the screen. We lost him.

1067
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:23,740
小梅？
Maddy?

1068
01:22:30,160 --> 01:22:31,110
小梅？
Maddy?

1069
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:40,310
小梅？
Maddy?

1070
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:43,310
葛瑞芬？
Griffin?

1071
01:23:00,000 --> 01:23:02,670
小梅，我们要离开这里
Maddy, we have to go.

1072
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:04,940
我不能走
I can't.

1073
01:23:05,160 --> 01:23:07,790
你可以，我们现在就要走了
Yes, you can. We have to go now.

1074
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:21,820
他们不会让我走的
They'll never let me leave.

1075
01:23:25,680 --> 01:23:26,550
那条绳子！
The rope!

1076
01:23:33,560 --> 01:23:34,510
绳子松掉了！
The rope!

1077
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:49,340
跑，小梅，快！
Run, Maddy, come on!

1078
01:24:05,080 --> 01:24:07,350
小梅！葛瑞芬！
Maddy! Griffin!

1079
01:24:07,720 --> 01:24:08,700
哦，我的天
Oh, my God.

1080
01:24:08,880 --> 01:24:10,750
我抱住你们了，我的宝贝们  没事的，天啊
I got you, my babies. You'll be okay. Oh, my God.

1081
01:24:10,920 --> 01:24:12,190
他们还有脉搏
They have a pulse.

1082
01:24:12,400 --> 01:24:13,540
艾瑞克！
Eric!

1083
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,670
他们在呼吸，她有呼吸
They're breathing. She's breathing.

1084
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,150
妈妈在这里
Mommy's right here.

1085
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:18,340
上帝！天啊！
Jesus! God!

1086
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:19,740
他们没事吧？
Are they okay?

1087
01:24:20,040 --> 01:24:21,990
- 现在怎么办？  - 马上让他们泡水！
- What do we do? - Get them in the water now!

1088
01:24:22,200 --> 01:24:23,670
好，快点
Okay, come on.

1089
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:25,350
快醒醒，宝贝
Wake up, baby.

1090
01:24:25,520 --> 01:24:26,580
好了，亲爱的
Okay, sweetheart.

1091
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:28,230
快，宝贝，醒醒啊
Come on, baby, wake up.

1092
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:30,070
听得见吗？听得见妈妈说话吗？
Can you hear me? Can you hear Momma?

1093
01:24:30,240 --> 01:24:31,670
好，快醒来，亲爱的
All right, wake up, sweetheart.

1094
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:33,190
求求你
Come on.

1095
01:24:33,360 --> 01:24:35,350
葛瑞芬，求你快醒来
Griffin, please wake up. Please.

1096
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,350
- 全靠你了，小家伙  - 快点醒来
- I'm counting on you, buddy. - I need you to wake up right now.

1097
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:40,550
好孩子！好孩子！
Good boy! Good boy!

1098
01:24:40,760 --> 01:24:42,550
- 他醒了！  - 小梅还好吗？
- There he is! - Is Maddy okay?

1099
01:24:42,760 --> 01:24:44,070
- 小梅还好  - 小梅没事吧？
- Yeah, Maddy's okay. - Is Maddy okay?

1100
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:45,220
小梅会没事的
Maddy's gonna be okay.

1101
01:24:45,400 --> 01:24:47,430
- 听得见妈妈的声音吗？  - 醒醒宝贝
- Can you hear Momma? - Come on, sweetheart.

1102
01:24:47,880 --> 01:24:50,230
求求你快醒来
Please wake up. Please wake up.

1103
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:54,540
哦，亲爱的宝贝！哦，宝贝！
Oh, sweetheart! Oh, baby!

1104
01:24:54,720 --> 01:24:57,020
嗨，亲爱的，嗨，我的甜心
Hi, sweetheart. Hi, sweetheart.

1105
01:24:57,200 --> 01:24:59,430
嗨，妈妈，嗨，爸爸
Hi, Mommy. Hi, Daddy.

1106
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:00,630
嗨
Hi.

1107
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,070
嗨，甜心
Hi, sweetheart.

1108
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:03,910
没事的，妈妈
It's okay, Mommy.

1109
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,700
葛瑞芬救了我
Griffin saved me.

1110
01:25:05,880 --> 01:25:07,710
对，他救了你，知道为什么吗？
Yeah, he did. You know why?

1111
01:25:07,880 --> 01:25:09,910
因为你是我们的超人宝贝
Because you're our super boy.

1112
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:11,710
对，没错
Yeah. Yeah.

1113
01:25:13,320 --> 01:25:15,310
我爱你们，我爱你，爸爸
I love you, two. I love you, Daddy.

1114
01:25:16,120 --> 01:25:18,630
哦，我的天，哦，我的天
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1115
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:30,270
好了，快上车
All right, hop in your seat.

1116
01:25:30,440 --> 01:25:32,110
我们会回来吗？
Are we ever coming back?

1117
01:25:32,280 --> 01:25:34,790
不会，宝贝，打死都不会
No, sweetie. There's no way in hell.

1118
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:36,790
好了，系上安全带
Okay, seatbelt.

1119
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,390
嘿，谢谢你们
Hey, thanks for everything...

1120
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:41,710
希望我们不会再见面
and I hope we never see you again.

1121
01:25:42,240 --> 01:25:44,110
不知道为何大家总是这么说
I don't know why they always say that.

1122
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:45,380
- 再见  - 再见
- Bye. - Bye.

1123
01:25:48,320 --> 01:25:50,950
跟我说你欠我的那个故事
So tell me. I deserve it.

1124
01:25:55,920 --> 01:25:58,590
2012年在加州伯班克
Burbank, California, 2012.

1125
01:25:58,920 --> 01:26:02,750
拍摄闹鬼的洗车场那一集时
We were shooting an episode in a haunted car wash.

1126
01:26:03,160 --> 01:26:06,470
音效人员睡着了
And the sound guy fell asleep.

1127
01:26:07,160 --> 01:26:09,070
- 所以不是鬼？  - 不是
- So, not a ghost? - No.

1128
01:26:09,240 --> 01:26:14,230
只有拿着超大麦克风打磕睡的人
Just a dozy boom operator with a very, very large microphone.

1129
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:19,500
说你的招牌台词
Do the line.

1130
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:20,980
我不说
I'm not saying it.

1131
01:26:21,160 --> 01:26:22,590
妈，我要给萝伦看
Mom, it's for Lauren.

1132
01:26:22,760 --> 01:26:24,270
伯克，说一下吧！
Burke, give her the line!

1133
01:26:25,600 --> 01:26:26,630
这间房子干净了
The house is clean.

1134
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:28,140
认真点，拜托
Better. Come on.

1135
01:26:28,920 --> 01:26:31,350
这间房子干净了
The house is clean.

1136
01:26:31,520 --> 01:26:33,030
哦，天哪！她会高兴死
Oh, my God! She's gonna freak.

1137
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,030
“这间房子干净了”
"This house is clean."

1138
01:26:36,200 --> 01:26:37,470
其实没有
It isn't though.

1139
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,150
当然干净了，亲爱的
Of course it is, sweetheart.

1140
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:41,270
你帮那些灵魂进入光亮了
You helped the spirits go into the light.

1141
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:42,870
但他们没有去
But they didn't.

1142
01:26:44,680 --> 01:26:45,710
- 爸，快走！  - 爸，快！
- Dad, go! - Dad, go!

1143
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,510
他们没有进入光亮，妈妈
They didn't go into the light, Mommy.

1144
01:26:47,720 --> 01:26:50,430
他们要我带他们去，但我没进去
They needed me to take them but I wouldn't go in...

1145
01:26:50,640 --> 01:26:52,270
所以他们也没进去
so neither did they.

1146
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:54,100
- 爸，走！  - 走！
- Dad, go! - Go!

1147
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,110
快下车
Get out of the car.

1148
01:27:36,720 --> 01:27:38,070
亲爱的，你还好吗？
Honey, you okay?

1149
01:27:38,720 --> 01:27:39,830
你没事吧？
You okay?

1150
01:27:40,000 --> 01:27:41,140
- 大家都好吗？  - 好
- Is everybody okay? - Yeah.

1151
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:42,430
艾瑞克，艾瑞克
Eric. Eric.

1152
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:44,430
我在这里，宝贝，撑着
Here, baby. Hold on.

1153
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:46,990
小梅呢？
Where's Maddy?

1154
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:49,510
小梅呢？她在哪里？
Where is she? Where is she?

1155
01:27:49,680 --> 01:27:50,740
小梅！
Maddy!

1156
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:52,500
妈妈
Mommy.

1157
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:55,550
我觉得怪怪的，妈
Something's wrong, Mom.

1158
01:27:57,920 --> 01:27:58,590
小梅！
Maddy!

1159
01:27:58,760 --> 01:27:59,870
- 哦，天！  - 妈！
- Oh, God! - Mom!

1160
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:17,790
小梅！
Maddy!

1161
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:28,470
- 妈妈！妈妈！  - 小梅！
- Mom! Mom! - Maddy!

1162
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:30,070
妈！
Mom!

1163
01:28:30,280 --> 01:28:31,750
- 抓紧！  - 妈妈！妈妈！
- Hold on! - Mom! Mom!

1164
01:28:31,920 --> 01:28:33,550
过来，宝贝，过来
Come on, baby. Come on.

1165
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:34,780
妈妈！
Mommy!

1166
01:28:37,240 --> 01:28:38,070
加油，宝贝
Come on, baby.

1167
01:28:38,480 --> 01:28:39,460
撑住！
Hold on!

1168
01:29:02,080 --> 01:29:03,590
快拉！
Pull!

1169
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,310
用力拉！
Pull!

1170
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:10,830
放过这家人
Release your hold on this family...

1171
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:13,790
如同你们希望自己被释放
as you yourselves wish to be released...

1172
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:29,190
不，别做傻事
No. Don't do something stupid.

1173
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:32,150
我总是做傻事，所以你才离开是吧？
I always do something stupid. Isn't that why you left me?

1174
01:29:32,320 --> 01:29:33,430
卡利根，拜托
Carrigan, please.

1175
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:35,510
他们不会放过这家人的
They're never gonna let this family go.

1176
01:29:35,720 --> 01:29:37,670
我不想在镜头前假装了，布鲁克
I'm tired of faking it for the cameras, Brooke.

1177
01:29:38,520 --> 01:29:41,870
你明知只有我能带他们进入光亮
I'm the only one left who can lead those souls into the light. You know that.

1178
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:43,860
等一下！
Wait!

1179
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:45,550
你不必这么做
You don't have to do this.

1180
01:29:45,720 --> 01:29:47,990
我知道，但我想这么做
I know. I want to.

1181
01:29:48,160 --> 01:29:48,870
等等
Wait.

1182
01:29:49,040 --> 01:29:51,030
我要怎么知道你回来了？
How will I know that you've made it back?

1183
01:29:51,200 --> 01:29:53,110
我会想出办法的
I'll think of something.

1184
01:29:53,320 --> 01:29:54,380
再见，布鲁克
Bye, Brooke.

1185
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:02,350
艾米，过来这里
Amy, come here.

1186
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:04,190
我们走
Let's go.

1187
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:10,230
小梅！
Maddy!

1188
01:30:10,720 --> 01:30:12,030
我们快走！
Let's go! Come on.

1189
01:30:16,920 --> 01:30:17,900
小心头，走吧
- Watch your head. Let's go.

1190
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:20,830
小梅，好，我们快走
- Maddy. Okay, let's go.

1191
01:30:29,680 --> 01:30:30,710
妈妈会抓住你
Mommy's gonna get you.

1192
01:30:30,880 --> 01:30:31,750
不要！
No!

1193
01:30:31,920 --> 01:30:34,270
肯洁！快过来，我们走！
Kendra! Come here. Let's go!

1194
01:30:34,440 --> 01:30:35,990
对不起，我对你那么坏，爸
I'm sorry I'm such a bitch to you, Dad.

1195
01:30:36,200 --> 01:30:38,230
没关系，亲爱的，之后再说吧？快走
It's okay, honey. Can we talk about it later? Let's go.

1196
01:30:43,920 --> 01:30:45,110
哦，该死
Oh, shit.

1197
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:55,540
嘿！
Hey!

1198
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:56,790
你在干嘛？
What are you doing?

1199
01:30:57,400 --> 01:30:59,270
这是我的工作！
- I've got a job to do!

1200
01:30:59,440 --> 01:30:59,990
等等！
- Wait!

1201
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,260
爸！
Dad!

1202
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:23,200
艾米，我们要找辆车
Amy, we gotta find a car.

1203
01:31:23,360 --> 01:31:26,150
艾瑞克，开我的车吧，快走
Eric, take mine. Go!

1204
01:31:31,280 --> 01:31:32,310
妈！
Mom!

1205
01:31:36,880 --> 01:31:38,430
快！我们走！
Come on! Let's go!

1206
01:32:14,640 --> 01:32:16,790
爸爸，它会跟着我们吗？
Dad, is it gonna follow us?

1207
01:32:18,120 --> 01:32:21,150
葛瑞芬，别向后看
Griff, don't look back. Don't look back.

1208
01:33:24,680 --> 01:33:26,510
有他的信号吗？
Any sign of him?

1209
01:33:30,840 --> 01:33:33,140
没有，定位抓不到他
Nothing. The GPS isn't picking him up.

1210
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:38,230
目标：卡利根伯克  距离

1211
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,910
等等，有信号了
Wait. We're getting something.

1212
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:53,830
出售

1213
01:33:55,760 --> 01:33:57,030
- 你们好！  - 你好
- Hello! - Hi.

1214
01:33:57,200 --> 01:33:58,670
你们好！看来你们没迷路
Hello! You obviously found it okay.

1215
01:33:58,760 --> 01:33:59,590
胡帕中学棒球队

1216
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,030
很漂亮，不是吗？
Isn't it beautiful?

1217
01:34:01,200 --> 01:34:03,550
我想就是这间了，学区好
I think this one is it. Great school district...

1218
01:34:03,720 --> 01:34:05,710
离高中球场也很近
the high school ball field's close by.

1219
01:34:05,880 --> 01:34:07,020
里面更棒
Wait till you see the inside.

1220
01:34:07,240 --> 01:34:08,350
四间精美的卧室
Four proper bedrooms...

1221
01:34:08,520 --> 01:34:10,550
而且衣柜的空间超多
and the place is just swimming in closet space.

1222
01:34:11,720 --> 01:34:13,550
其实我们没有很想要大衣柜
That's not really high on our wish list.

1223
01:34:13,720 --> 01:34:15,710
我们之前的衣柜把我吃掉了
Our last closet ate me.

1224
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:17,910
你真可爱
That's sweet.

1225
01:34:19,400 --> 01:34:21,910
总之这间房子真的很有特色
Anyway, this house just screams character.

1226
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:24,750
看看这些壁板和走廊
Look at the wainscoting. And in here is the foyer.

1227
01:34:25,080 --> 01:34:26,910
里里外外都有当时的风格
Period detail throughout.

1228
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:28,270
这是起居室
And this is the den.

1229
01:34:28,440 --> 01:34:31,230
正面对着后院，很适合小孩
The den leads right into the back yard. Perfect for the kids.

1230
01:34:31,400 --> 01:34:34,350
看到那棵老树了吗？房子盖好前…
And do you see that tree? It's ancient. It was here before...

1231
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:36,110
人呢？
Hello?

1232
01:34:37,280 --> 01:34:38,470
你们在哪？
Hello?

1233
01:34:40,440 --> 01:34:41,550
好极了
Perfect.

1234
01:34:42,600 --> 01:34:44,270
我们快走吧
Let's get out of here.

1235
01:35:37,000 --> 01:35:41,150
这座如迷宫般的下水道
Is this labyrinthine network of sewers playing host...

1236
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:42,830
有没有恶灵四窜呢？
to a malevolent spirit?

1237
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,590
我是卡利根伯克，我来这是…
I'm Carrigan Burke, and I'm here to...

1238
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:49,100
我是布鲁克拍威尔，我们来清理鬼屋
And I'm Brooke Powell, and we're here to clean house.

1239
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:50,990
- 我还没讲完！  - 抱歉，不是该我了吗？
- I hadn't finished! - I'm sorry. Was that not my cue?

1240
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:52,300
- 我还没讲完  - 对不起
- I hadn't finished my line. - I'm sorry.

1241
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:55,110
我们不会说“清理鬼屋”，剪掉
And we're not saying "clean house." We cut that.

1242
01:35:55,280 --> 01:35:58,310
我以为“卡利根伯克”后就该我
Because I thought that my cue was when you said, "And I'm Carrigan Burke."

1243
01:35:58,520 --> 01:36:00,150
- 我没说  - 我听到“我来”
- I didn't even say that. - As soon as I heard "and"...

1244
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,300
所以我就出场了
I just came right out.

1245
01:36:01,520 --> 01:36:02,870
但你还是错了
That's the wrong one, though.

1246
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:04,150
好吧
Okay.

1247
01:36:08,000 --> 01:36:10,190
谁能告诉我到底怎么讲才对？
Does someone wanna tell me the right one?
