1
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,226
Thank you.

2
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,210
Did you prepare a lot for the exam?

3
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,914
I have to quit drinking or I can't.

4
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:35,934
If you go into the palace and get married, you'll fix your life.

5
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:38,654
I heard you're going to hire a drunkard this time.

6
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:41,994
You know the guy who went into the palace last year?

7
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,994
He bought a house.

8
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:45,994
How much is it?

9
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:47,994
It's a big deal.

10
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,994
Oh, I'm going to be nice to the crown prince.

11
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:55,794
Why?

12
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:57,794
Are you going to take the exam?

13
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:00,794
Yes, I can see it.

14
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:03,794
Yeah, Kyungsoo should fix his life now.

15
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:06,794
Of course, Kyungsoo should fix his life.

16
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:10,794
Hurry up and finish it and get ready to get a five-month-old.

17
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:11,794
Oh, yes, yes.

18
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,794
Oh, he's here. He's here.

19
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:21,442
He's Lee Hyung-ik from the palace.

20
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:46,802
The irregularity of the pulse seems to have a problem.

21
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:52,442
You need more oxygen?

22
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:55,442
If you don't do the test right away, it will be difficult to get through today.

23
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:57,442
Do the test right away.

24
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:02,442
This thread is not the thread I usually use.

25
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:07,442
I think it's more of a problem of the mind than the body.

26
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:11,186
Hey, let's take a look at the body.

27
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,186
I've seen enough.

28
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,186
It seems to be wind.

29
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,186
It's not safe.

30
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:22,186
Is it a small dog?

31
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,186
What do you do with that?

32
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,970
I heard footsteps earlier, and I was limping.

33
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,970
The short and irregular breathing interval seems to be a short temper and lack of patience, so it seems to be blowing.

34
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,970
Can you do that without even having a diagnosis?

35
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,970
It's all nonsense to diagnose with a thread in the first place.

36
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,938
Writing a poem is just a premeditation from the aspect that can't diagnose the inner-body.

37
00:05:48,938 --> 00:06:00,006
In fact, you will have to diagnose through a conversation with a patient.

38
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,098
If it were you, where would you be?

39
00:06:55,002 --> 00:07:00,162
Hey, did I tell you not to run?

40
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:01,642
You're a good kid.

41
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:03,002
You're a good kid.

42
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,862
You're so good at everything.

43
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,842
Kyungsoo, you're so lucky.

44
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:09,882
I knew it would work out someday.

45
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:12,242
Don't work so hard.

46
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:14,782
Eat.

47
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:21,442
When a person lives honestly, good things happen.

48
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,922
Here you go.

49
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:25,102
One.

50
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:27,782
What's wrong?

51
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,342
No, it's not.

52
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:30,442
Thank you.

53
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,802
Why do you always stay still?

54
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:43,426
Everything will be fine as long as you become a mother.

55
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:50,306
It's good, right?

56
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:51,306
Yeah.

57
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:57,378
When you go to the palace, you can buy a house and fix your financial problems.

58
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:59,378
Everything will be fine.

59
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:05,378
Kyung-jae, if you go to the palace this time, you can't come out for a while.

60
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:08,378
Why? How much?

61
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:13,378
If you go to the palace for the first time, you'll learn a lot, so you'll be out after a month.

62
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:16,378
Instead, you can go around the house after a month.

63
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:19,378
You told me to dig up the grass when I went to the mountain to dig up the grass.

64
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:22,378
Hey, that's a grass digger.

65
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:26,378
You said you wanted to eat that, so you're going to dig it up.

66
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:31,174
Did you enjoy it or not?

67
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:36,578
Young-ju, are you okay?

68
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:49,698
You bastard!

69
00:08:49,698 --> 00:08:51,698
If you go in there and get a beating,

70
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,698
you can pay for everything you've been pushed for.

71
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:56,698
Just wait for the arrival.

72
00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:59,698
What are you talking about?

73
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:04,698
You know that if you don't have a heart, you'll die.

74
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:15,014
You've been pushed so far, but you don't have a conscience.

75
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,766
You have to take your medicine without me.

76
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:31,722
I have no one without you.

77
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,822
Why don't you have me?

78
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:41,350
Sweet sleep, sweet sleep.

79
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,106
Hey, Hong Hyesung!

80
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:27,606
You pretend you didn't hear or see anything!

81
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:31,106
Oh, you don't care, do you?

82
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:35,606
Anyway, you should always be careful.

83
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,506
You know I'm handsome.

84
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:43,906
So that you can understand,

85
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:48,706
I'm a little bit of a woman's type.

86
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:52,606
But isn't the other side of the military?

87
00:10:56,474 --> 00:11:00,814
Yes, this is the new shortcut.

88
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:13,362
This way.

89
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:18,062
If you think you have to answer, just say yes.

90
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:23,862
In the palace, there are roads that we can walk on.

91
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:25,762
There are roads that we can't walk on.

92
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:28,462
So you have to stay alert.

93
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:30,462
Especially the inner palace.

94
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:33,462
You can't even talk in the inner palace.

95
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,362
Now, be careful.

96
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:39,962
This is the inner palace.

97
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:42,162
Over there is the medicine room.

98
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:44,762
And over there is the storage room.

99
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:49,062
You can't see, right?

100
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:50,862
Come this way.

101
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,462
Here.

102
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,462
Here. Here. Here.

103
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:55,962
Sit here.

104
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:58,162
That's right. That's right.

105
00:11:58,162 --> 00:11:59,362
Sit here for a while.

106
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:03,362
I'll bring you your clothes.

107
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,482
How dare you touch my stuff as soon as you came in?

108
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:08,842
You don't even know what this is

109
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:13,186
Be gentle, gentle

110
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:15,186
You're touching the poison without permission

111
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:17,186
Do you think I touched it because I knew it was poison?

112
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:23,206
I'll give you a hard time, so let's move on this time

113
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:30,426
That little rat is so stubborn.

114
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:33,866
Sit down, sit down.

115
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:36,026
Sit down, sit down.

116
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:42,566
The inner court is a place that deals with human life, so the hierarchy is fierce.

117
00:13:44,646 --> 00:13:50,270
But why is there poison in the inner court?

118
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,190
How can I make it with chemicals?

119
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,290
Oh, my.

120
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,730
Eat, eat, eat.

121
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,970
You know you have to write a check every two days, right?

122
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,730
I'm not sleepy, so I'll help you for the first few days.

123
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,374
Don't worry too much.

124
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,330
If you're sleepy, go to sleep

125
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:35,782
I can't sleep while I'm on duty

126
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:37,782
I'm going to read a book over there

127
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:49,094
Oh, you don't need a light, do you?

128
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:53,062
I'll turn off all the lights.

129
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,678
You're so quick-witted.

130
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:21,762
Gyeongje, it's still very cold at night, but how are you doing?

131
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:27,242
It's only been a day, but it feels like it's been a full moon.

132
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:31,162
The people of my hospital are all kind and good people.

133
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:39,558
It's comfortable and nice to stay with Samchi's meat side dish.

134
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:14,146
Hey, Jin Chang.

135
00:17:14,146 --> 00:17:17,066
Put all the drugs here, okay?

136
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:20,826
Hey, how can you do this to So-kyung?

137
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:26,854
That's why I'm making you do it.

138
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:06,418
If you wait for me, I'll buy you something delicious.

139
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:13,030
So you have to take your medicine and stay healthy.

140
00:18:16,218 --> 00:18:22,838
Why are you so excited?

141
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:24,958
What are you excited about?

142
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,938
There are only a few days left.

143
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:30,978
The day the crown prince will come.

144
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:36,878
It's been 8 years since the crown prince was taken to the Qing Dynasty.

145
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:42,398
The crown prince was taken to the Qing Dynasty and the queen couldn't even see her parents alone.

146
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:44,638
That disease at that young age.

147
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:46,438
Pyeongyang.

148
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,070
It's a secret only the people of the palace know.

149
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,150
The Queen Mother can't cover her urine until she's over 10 years old.

150
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,170
You must never tell anyone.

151
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,226
Yes.

152
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:16,786
Your Majesty So-yong has a severe stomachache.

153
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:25,026
Your Majesty So-yong, I'll call the maid.

154
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:28,666
Forget it. I have a hobby.

155
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:46,498
What are you doing?

156
00:19:46,498 --> 00:19:49,606
I'm not going to say hello.

157
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,666
Is this a new volunteer?

158
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,666
Yes, your highness.

159
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,666
Thank you.

160
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:43,178
My arm is frozen and I can't digest it.

161
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:50,162
I'll try it in the middle.

162
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:54,694
That's right.

163
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:32,230
Will it end today?

164
00:22:14,938 --> 00:22:18,238
You've picked a good hobby this time.

165
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:20,438
I'm Hwang Song-hwa, Your Majesty.

166
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:26,246
The Crown Prince's men have passed the post.

167
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:30,634
I heard the Crown Prince is coming back from the palace.

168
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:33,134
I guess my body is reacting first.

169
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:36,534
Your body is cold because you've been over-stressed.

170
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:39,534
It's best to take it easy.

171
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,534
I'm not worried.

172
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:45,906
I'm worried about my son.

173
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,210
It's from the school across the street.

174
00:23:36,986 --> 00:23:38,186
Did you see everything?

175
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:43,434
If you tell people that you saw me,

176
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:44,434
they'll scold you.

177
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,350
Your Highness!

178
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,750
Your Highness!

179
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,950
Your Highness!

180
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,150
Did you see Her Highness?

181
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,490
I'm So Gyeong.

182
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,470
Your Highness!

183
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,070
Your Highness!

184
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,670
Your Highness!

185
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:23,074
Do you really not see anything?

186
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:26,238
Yes, your highness

187
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:28,538
Since when?

188
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:31,218
I haven't seen anything since I was born

189
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:32,578
Then...

190
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:36,498
Have you never seen your parents?

191
00:24:36,498 --> 00:24:44,390
Yes, I haven't seen anything

192
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:18,198
What about the tonic?

193
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:21,698
Father said he's already over the limit of the tonic

194
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:22,698
It's all done

195
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:24,498
If you drink it yourself,

196
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:27,198
the Crown Prince will be even happier

197
00:25:28,998 --> 00:25:32,470
It's my hobby

198
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,470
It's my hobby

199
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:41,438
Your Majesty, the time has come to leave.

200
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:43,438
Let's go! Let's go!

201
00:26:01,114 --> 00:26:03,814
Why isn't Ma Jung Na Eun here?

202
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:56,986
If you are so loyal that you can't even greet the crown prince who has returned after 8 years, I, the king, will have to check the king's condition.

203
00:26:58,246 --> 00:27:00,658
Follow me.

204
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,058
If you take one step there, your necks will fly away.

205
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:10,178
The king is sick, what are you doing here?

206
00:27:10,818 --> 00:27:13,098
This is the king's bed.

207
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:17,358
You should just mind your own business.

208
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:46,682
If I can't even take care of the company of the head of the Yeomijung, I'll resign.

209
00:28:04,762 --> 00:28:08,362
The Crown Prince and the Cheongnara assassin have arrived.

210
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:20,826
Now the world where the Qing Dynasty dominates the world has come.

211
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:25,006
Since the Crown Prince came back with such a gun on his back,

212
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:30,786
where could there be a deeper thing than this?

213
00:28:32,306 --> 00:28:37,402
Your Highness, the Crown Prince has arrived.

214
00:28:37,402 --> 00:28:42,662
Your Highness.

215
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:13,158
You've had a hard time, son.

216
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:50,186
Let's go!

217
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:07,626
Welcome, Seol Gyeong-bi.

218
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:10,794
Go ahead.

219
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:12,794
What do you want?

220
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:21,282
I want to talk to you.

221
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:23,282
Go ahead.

222
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:29,570
What does he want?

223
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,570
He wants me to translate.

224
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,570
Go ahead.

225
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,898
Go ahead!

226
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:41,898
Translate before the situation gets worse.

227
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:26,086
If you think about what you did to Jim in Namsan 8 years ago...

228
00:32:32,858 --> 00:32:38,506
It would be right to destroy you as the King of Joseon.

229
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:56,082
I'll give you the things over there as a gift.

230
00:32:56,082 --> 00:32:57,482
I'll organize them for you.

231
00:32:57,482 --> 00:32:59,382
Yes, I understand.

232
00:33:01,282 --> 00:33:03,082
The things over there...

233
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,482
This is the second room...

234
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,682
It's so pretty.

235
00:33:07,682 --> 00:33:10,982
It hasn't changed at all.

236
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:13,282
Is there a guest?

237
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,282
Yes.

238
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:15,282
Oh, my.

239
00:33:16,382 --> 00:33:17,682
You startled me.

240
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,082
We almost got in trouble.

241
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,582
We left the Cheongnara's body in front of us

242
00:33:23,582 --> 00:33:25,082
and you say it's a body?

243
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:29,074
The Cheongsa people speak well of Joseon.

244
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,974
If they speak of Cheongnara,

245
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:37,574
it means that they have become the owners of the country.

246
00:33:39,774 --> 00:33:42,174
The 8 years you've spent in Cheongnara

247
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:44,674
doesn't seem like a short time.

248
00:33:47,882 --> 00:33:53,982
You should prepare for a new era.

249
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:55,382
A new era?

250
00:33:55,382 --> 00:33:57,582
The name that Joseon had was ruined

251
00:33:57,582 --> 00:34:01,182
and now Cheongnara has become the owner of the country.

252
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:03,682
Shouldn't Joseon accept the body of the late King Sok-hui

253
00:34:03,682 --> 00:34:07,882
and change according to the times?

254
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:10,982
We must change everything.

255
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:14,782
If we don't change, Joseon will die.

256
00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:17,782
The problem is what the King has decided.

257
00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:20,382
Do you know what the situation is like this year?

258
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:24,382
The people of Hwanghaedo are starving.

259
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:32,794
The crown prince,

260
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:35,314
for the sake of Joseon,

261
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:38,530
please sign the agreement.

262
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,570
Are you telling me

263
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:46,586
to drive your father out and take Yongsang?

264
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:52,066
Oh, that's not possible.

265
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:54,406
But

266
00:34:54,406 --> 00:35:02,846
it meant that you should always be prepared.

267
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:05,126
What are you doing?

268
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:09,310
What are you going to do now?

269
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,678
If the road is blocked,

270
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:14,878
we have to make a new road.

271
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:19,838
This is the true appearance of the land where we live.

272
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:26,838
People come here by boat to the border and exchange new things and books.

273
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:28,538
This is

274
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:30,238
Joseon.

275
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:31,438
This little land.

276
00:35:31,438 --> 00:35:36,006
That's what they taught me.

277
00:35:40,058 --> 00:35:47,058
Father, the Qing Dynasty is growing day by day, accepting Western culture.

278
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:50,438
Don't cling to the past and look at the future.

279
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:54,658
Don't you know why I'm wearing this?

280
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:58,298
Do you still have the Naman Mountain 8 years ago in your heart?

281
00:35:58,818 --> 00:35:59,878
No, I don't.

282
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:03,586
Still.

283
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,222
We have to follow

284
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,122
the order.

285
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:13,722
That's the way to find your and my authenticity and to reveal the future of Joseon.

286
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,802
The order is already ruined.

287
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:21,082
I saw it with my own eyes in the northern border.

288
00:36:22,582 --> 00:36:29,986
Father, don't pursue a false justification and accept the Qing Dynasty as a bus and a newspaper.

289
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:33,026
That's the way to make Joseon work and for you.

290
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:36,906
What are you talking about for me?

291
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:39,386
As a bus.

292
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:41,386
As a bus.

293
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:46,794
We have to change it.

294
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:55,346
If we can't change it, Joseon will die.

295
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:06,666
Your eyes have changed

296
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:20,298
Are you still sleeping because of the cough?

297
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:23,666
I'm fine.

298
00:37:24,486 --> 00:37:27,026
Pull out a reliable doctor and keep him by your side.

299
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:31,878
Treat him consistently.

300
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,458
I heard a lot about my original hand.

301
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,458
You took good care of the original hand.

302
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,458
I just did what I had to do.

303
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:52,458
Your Highness has been on a long journey and your body is very damaged.

304
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:55,458
Can you take care of my treatment?

305
00:37:56,458 --> 00:38:00,106
I'm not good enough, but I'll do my best. Your Highness.

306
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:03,718
Thank you.

307
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:10,538
I'm your father, Cheon Bong Sa, who will help you to spit accurately.

308
00:38:12,138 --> 00:38:16,290
Oh, you're So Gyeong.

309
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,394
Your Majesty, So Gyeong is better at spitting.

310
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:25,794
I didn't know that.

311
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:28,194
I'm looking forward to working with you, Cheon Bong Sa.

312
00:38:28,194 --> 00:38:32,902
Yes, mother.

313
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,250
You're the Duke of Seosan who serves the Crown Prince.

314
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,050
Where is the King?

315
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,850
Yes, he has left the palace.

316
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,450
His Majesty is coughing a lot.

317
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,750
Follow me.

318
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,290
Well, according to the law of the palace,

319
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,950
I can't treat him alone.

320
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,650
He's sick. Why does the law matter so much?

321
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,742
Follow me.

322
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:32,390
Cough, cough, cough.

323
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:37,066
I heard your lung is badly damaged.

324
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:39,866
Can you fix it?

325
00:39:40,966 --> 00:39:43,866
It's just a hobby.

326
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:47,738
I think you have something to say.

327
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:51,862
No, Your Majesty.

328
00:39:53,462 --> 00:39:55,414
Say it.

329
00:39:55,414 --> 00:40:01,702
You're a doctor who pretends not to have seen a patient's illness.

330
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:17,442
His body is stiffened and hardened.

331
00:40:17,442 --> 00:40:20,442
It's because of the excessive feed, so the blood can't circulate.

332
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:28,326
You need to take a load off your mind to recover your body.

333
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,702
Open the window for me.

334
00:40:32,702 --> 00:40:39,654
I think I'm already coughing.

335
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:57,406
Father, you must have gotten cold.

336
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:01,446
Can you take a look at him?

337
00:41:01,446 --> 00:41:06,886
How dare a crazy man like him call the king?

338
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,850
I beg you.

339
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:19,906
Yes, In-seong.

340
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:22,010
Thank you.

341
00:41:32,538 --> 00:41:37,418
This time, I'll do a blood test to release the clotted energy.

342
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:50,242
You can see it.

343
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:52,658
No, trust me.

344
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:55,318
Are you trying to fool me?

345
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:59,238
How dare I lie to you?

346
00:41:59,238 --> 00:42:04,230
You're going to lie to me until the end?

347
00:42:11,514 --> 00:42:13,514
I don't want to be a burden anymore.

348
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:21,482
Let's go.

349
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:37,586
Cough, cough, cough

350
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:15,514
How did you write a letter to your brother when you couldn't see him?

351
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:24,674
It's hard for you to believe me, but I know a disease that can be seen a little in bright places and a little in dark places.

352
00:43:25,154 --> 00:43:27,834
I deserve to die, but my

353
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:32,234
sick brother dies without me.

354
00:43:32,314 --> 00:43:33,674
Please save me.

355
00:43:34,394 --> 00:43:38,514
Why did you say you couldn't see him when you could?

356
00:43:38,514 --> 00:43:44,014
People don't like to see the sunset.

357
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:49,606
How old is your brother?

358
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:54,950
He's 10 years old.

359
00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:00,486
You're the same age as our original hand.

360
00:44:07,802 --> 00:44:09,482
What would you do?

361
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:13,402
Didn't you?

362
00:44:13,602 --> 00:44:15,522
I have a disease in my heart.

363
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:21,194
What should I do to get rid of this disease?

364
00:44:21,354 --> 00:44:25,354
I was talking nonsense without knowing the score.

365
00:44:26,614 --> 00:44:28,538
Are you going to pretend

366
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:31,158
you don't know and pretend you don't see?

367
00:44:32,578 --> 00:44:33,998
Sometimes it's better to

368
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,218
close your eyes and live.

369
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:41,722
Are you telling me to be a small dog?

370
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:46,822
Do you have to live with your eyes closed for people as high as me?

371
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:52,022
You have to pretend you don't know or pretend you don't see people as low as a small person

372
00:44:52,502 --> 00:44:54,802
to get into the palace like this.

373
00:44:56,102 --> 00:44:58,670
You're sick because you've

374
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,010
seen everything so

375
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,890
well.

376
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,818
Seo Sang-gong,

377
00:45:07,818 --> 00:45:11,718
turn off the lights.

378
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:27,050
It's called enlargement.

379
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,006
You wrote the wrong letters

380
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:34,466
very hard.

381
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:41,958
You should know how to write properly to become a doctor.

382
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:54,818
They say it's good for you to live without looking.

383
00:45:55,718 --> 00:45:57,918
Can I just live with my eyes closed?

384
00:45:59,198 --> 00:46:00,338
The more I do that,

385
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:05,350
the more I have to open my eyes wide.

386
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:21,002
I'm so glad you're coughing.

387
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:26,002
Since there's still a little fever left, I prepared a small hot pot to cool down the fever.

388
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:32,486
I guess the medical staff ran away because they were afraid of the disease.

389
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,410
Is this the right place?

390
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:42,410
Yes, it is.

391
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:48,410
Mr. Choong, the Crown Prince has awarded you for your excellent physical ability.

392
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:52,410
It's a very precious medicine used for the heart disease that the Blue House brought.

393
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:59,174
It will be of great help to your younger brother's disease.

394
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:06,750
Wow, I didn't see it that way, but it's fast, it's fast.

395
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,050
If it goes well later, I can't pretend I don't know.

396
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,490
I'll go home the day after tomorrow, right?

397
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,090
Wow, you too.

398
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,810
I'm so happy.

399
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:58,490
But isn't it the crown prince who has a friendly relationship with the Qing?

400
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:04,490
If only the crown prince can stand on our side, the Qing will follow our will.

401
00:48:08,642 --> 00:48:09,642
Oh, my son.

402
00:48:09,642 --> 00:48:11,642
Oh, my son.

403
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:22,982
Good job.

404
00:48:40,058 --> 00:48:43,458
The Crown Prince has collapsed and is unconscious.

405
00:50:17,018 --> 00:50:18,418
Myungsoo! Myungsoo!

406
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:25,254
Thumbs up if you like this video! Hit the subscribe if you want more!

407
00:52:19,578 --> 00:52:25,078
Sir, do you need more Myeongjucheon?

408
00:53:00,538 --> 00:53:01,538
Good.

409
00:53:01,538 --> 00:53:04,794
You have a high fever.

410
00:53:04,794 --> 00:53:11,494
You can rest assured now.

411
00:53:26,922 --> 00:53:31,046
You've had a hard time.

412
00:53:39,226 --> 00:53:40,506
You've had a hard time.

413
00:53:40,506 --> 00:53:44,614
Go to the police station and close your eyes.

414
00:55:37,946 --> 00:55:39,946
Did something happen between them?

415
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:52,834
What's going on?

416
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:56,374
Someone...

417
00:56:56,874 --> 00:56:59,174
ran away over that window

418
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,650
What is it?

419
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,650
What's going on?

420
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,650
It's a robbery!

421
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,650
Hurry up and get in!

422
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,650
What is it?

423
00:58:21,882 --> 00:58:22,882
Sergeant Jang!

424
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:24,882
Sergeant Jang!

425
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:30,034
What happened?

426
00:58:30,034 --> 00:58:31,034
Sergeant Jang!

427
00:58:37,274 --> 00:58:39,634
I'll see it with my own eyes.

428
00:58:39,634 --> 00:58:40,874
Get out of my way!

429
00:58:40,874 --> 00:58:44,034
What a ridiculous thing to do.

430
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:47,942
Can't you get out of the way right now?

431
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,450
Move!

432
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,450
It's an order.

433
00:58:57,450 --> 00:58:59,450
No one is allowed to enter.

434
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,450
What a scoundrel!

435
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:53,642
No, no, no.

436
00:59:57,402 --> 01:00:01,002
He had a symptom of scabies, so he was taken to Myeongju Village,

437
01:00:01,002 --> 01:00:03,702
and he was burned to death.

438
01:00:03,702 --> 01:00:05,202
Scabies?

439
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:08,002
Yes. Fortunately, he's stable.

440
01:00:08,002 --> 01:00:11,502
I and the priest saw the Crown Prince sleeping,

441
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:23,850
Is what you say true?

442
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:31,098
Yes, sir.

443
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,130
It's the death-wish in my will.

444
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:54,130
The symptoms of the King's death are not the same as when he wrote the death-wish.

445
01:00:54,130 --> 01:01:02,790
Someone wrote this death-wish and poisoned the crown prince.

446
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:08,806
I saw someone running away.

447
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:12,578
Who did you see?

448
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:15,538
Save what you saw.

449
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:20,178
I was worried about the crown prince, so I went back to the Haesikyeong.

450
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:26,578
I saw someone running away through the window of his palace.

451
01:01:26,718 --> 01:01:30,018
He ran away and hurt the Gyeongcheob.

452
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,998
It's true.

453
01:01:33,878 --> 01:01:35,758
There was blood on the Gyeongcheob.

454
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:38,638
Does that mean he poisoned the crown prince?

455
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:45,518
Judging by the situation, the one who ran away with the wound seems to be the poisoner.

456
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:53,810
Your Highness, please inform the government about this.

457
01:01:55,190 --> 01:02:01,998
Did you forget your promise to the government that the crown prince will inherit the next position?

458
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:05,978
If you don't inform the government about the death of the king, the

459
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,490
Wake up.

460
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:16,490
Wake up.

461
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:19,490
We need to find the wounded.

462
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:20,490
Search the area.

463
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:51,946
What happened?

464
01:03:51,946 --> 01:03:54,066
The world

465
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:57,686
It's said to have been poisoned.

466
01:03:57,686 --> 01:04:02,346
But you're trying to cure that.

467
01:04:02,346 --> 01:04:04,546
What are you doing?

468
01:04:04,546 --> 01:04:07,806
Whose order is it?

469
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:09,806
I'm going to kill you right now!

470
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:18,730
How can I believe this?

471
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:20,230
Your Majesty.

472
01:05:20,230 --> 01:05:23,730
That you poisoned the crown prince of Yeongi, who cherishes our Wonson so much.

473
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:25,926
Your Majesty.

474
01:05:38,106 --> 01:05:39,506
Is there no one there?

475
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:43,246
I gave poison to the princess and the crown prince.

476
01:05:43,546 --> 01:05:45,726
There must be poison on the tip of the needle.

477
01:05:47,346 --> 01:05:51,054
It's a wound I got when I went back to the palace to save the crown prince.

478
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:51,714
Are you saying you gave up the small

479
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:54,034
guard?

480
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:57,014
I can see a little in the dark.

481
01:05:58,534 --> 01:06:02,190
After trying to study with these eyes, the

482
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,174
crown prince

483
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:09,350
gave it to me.

484
01:06:18,298 --> 01:06:21,738
Have you seen the magnifying glass that the government brought?

485
01:06:29,146 --> 01:06:33,498
You finally found my master.

486
01:06:33,498 --> 01:06:38,818
You knew I could see a little bit, but you kept it a secret.

487
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:43,526
Why would I kill such a benefactor alone?

488
01:06:55,034 --> 01:06:57,034
Lee Young-ik poisoned the crown prince's son?

489
01:07:01,002 --> 01:07:02,002
Yes, your highness.

490
01:07:03,822 --> 01:07:06,422
I will meet the king with this letter.

491
01:07:07,822 --> 01:07:09,822
If you need it, I will call you.

492
01:07:10,922 --> 01:07:12,922
Don't get caught until then and hide well.

493
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:37,178
There are still a hundred people who haven't been identified.

494
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,578
We're looking for them one by one.

495
01:07:39,578 --> 01:07:40,378
Hurry.

496
01:07:56,282 --> 01:07:57,202
Hey.

497
01:07:58,262 --> 01:08:02,398
I'm from the Navy.

498
01:08:02,738 --> 01:08:04,118
I got tested.

499
01:08:04,118 --> 01:08:08,774
What's your name?

500
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:14,650
I asked what your name was.

501
01:08:27,994 --> 01:08:29,994
What are you doing here?

502
01:08:30,994 --> 01:08:35,050
His Majesty has a paralysis symptom.

503
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,050
Hurry up and go.

504
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,050
What day is it?

505
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:39,050
It's the time for the examination.

506
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:42,050
Didn't you hear that His Majesty has a paralysis symptom?

507
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:43,050
Yes.

508
01:08:46,786 --> 01:08:50,786
I will be careful and careful.

509
01:08:51,786 --> 01:08:52,786
Yes, Your Majesty.

510
01:08:55,018 --> 01:08:58,018
This is abalone soup sent from Kang Bin's mother's home.

511
01:08:58,018 --> 01:09:03,018
Your Majesty, you should keep your temperature as much as possible at times like this.

512
01:09:03,018 --> 01:09:06,018
It's a paralysis because of the weak energy.

513
01:09:06,018 --> 01:09:11,018
Do you want to go to the throat?

514
01:09:11,018 --> 01:09:12,018
I didn't mean that.

515
01:09:12,018 --> 01:09:15,018
I'm going to reduce the alcohol from today.

516
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:19,018
I will write the crown prince's questions myself.

517
01:09:20,018 --> 01:09:22,018
Tell the doctor that.

518
01:09:22,018 --> 01:09:23,018
Yes.

519
01:09:23,018 --> 01:09:30,362
You're drooling well without even seeing it.

520
01:09:31,362 --> 01:09:32,362
Can you see it?

521
01:09:34,362 --> 01:09:36,362
You should drool from now on.

522
01:09:38,362 --> 01:09:40,362
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

523
01:09:43,418 --> 01:09:46,418
Please take the crown prince's words.

524
01:09:46,418 --> 01:09:54,470
Yes.

525
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,462
Are you okay?

526
01:10:18,262 --> 01:10:21,222
You have to wake up at times like this.

527
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:23,642
You have to think about the original.

528
01:10:25,242 --> 01:10:28,230
What's this?

529
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:31,090
This is the letter the witness gave me.

530
01:10:55,034 --> 01:10:56,594
Witness?

531
01:10:57,274 --> 01:10:58,814
What do you mean?

532
01:10:58,814 --> 01:11:05,830
The person who saw Lee Young-ik is not a reader, but a witness.

533
01:11:12,026 --> 01:11:16,526
Kang Bin, what are you talking about?

534
01:11:16,526 --> 01:11:21,886
Actually, this guy is the one who poisoned the crown prince.

535
01:11:21,886 --> 01:11:25,526
He framed the witness.

536
01:11:25,526 --> 01:11:27,166
It's unfair.

537
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:28,066
It's a treason.

538
01:11:28,066 --> 01:11:33,254
Wasn't this poison in that kid's head mine?

539
01:11:59,162 --> 01:12:00,542
What are you doing?

540
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:13,910
Yes.

541
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:17,450
Who's the witness.

542
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:21,338
Bring her here.

543
01:12:21,718 --> 01:12:22,698
The witness is.

544
01:12:22,698 --> 01:12:24,638
Mr. Oh Yeol-hee is not guilty.

545
01:12:24,638 --> 01:12:28,966
Oh Yeol-hee was with me.

546
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:21,410
What?

547
01:14:34,874 --> 01:14:36,074
You do it.

548
01:14:51,066 --> 01:14:52,066
Okay.

549
01:15:01,146 --> 01:15:03,146
What's going on?

550
01:15:03,146 --> 01:15:04,146
Look at this.

551
01:15:04,146 --> 01:15:06,146
How dare you poison Seonhwa's son?

552
01:15:06,146 --> 01:15:07,146
What are you?

553
01:15:07,146 --> 01:15:09,146
Get him out of here right now!

554
01:15:11,146 --> 01:15:13,146
Look at this.

555
01:15:13,146 --> 01:15:18,146
This evil woman is trying to poison her own son.

556
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:19,146
I'll get you punished.

557
01:15:19,146 --> 01:15:20,146
How can you do that to your son?

558
01:15:20,146 --> 01:15:22,146
I'll get you punished.

559
01:15:22,146 --> 01:15:24,146
How can you do that to your son?

560
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,146
How can you do that?

561
01:15:27,146 --> 01:15:29,146
I'll get you punished.

562
01:15:29,146 --> 01:15:32,218
We need to inform the court of the death of the Crown Prince.

563
01:15:32,218 --> 01:15:36,218
Can you get rid of Gangbin's accusation just because you're informing the court?

564
01:15:36,218 --> 01:15:38,218
We need to find out who did it.

565
01:15:38,218 --> 01:15:40,218
Who did it?

566
01:15:40,218 --> 01:15:42,218
It's Cho Young-cho.

567
01:15:43,218 --> 01:15:47,218
We need to get rid of Gangbin's accusation and catch Cho Young-cho.

568
01:15:48,218 --> 01:15:52,730
We need to have a witness.

569
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:55,730
A witness.

570
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:58,186
A witness?

571
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:00,186
A witness?

572
01:16:00,186 --> 01:16:02,186
You said you could do it.

573
01:16:02,186 --> 01:16:04,186
That's why you even gathered the eyes of a blind man.

574
01:16:04,186 --> 01:16:06,186
What are you doing?

575
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:07,186
Be nice.

576
01:16:07,186 --> 01:16:10,186
How far did you see the witness?

577
01:16:10,186 --> 01:16:13,186
What if he speaks?

578
01:16:13,186 --> 01:16:14,186
Tell me.

579
01:16:14,186 --> 01:16:16,186
Tell me.

580
01:16:18,186 --> 01:16:19,186
I can hear you.

581
01:16:19,186 --> 01:16:23,570
If you talk like that, I can hear you from the front door.

582
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:26,570
I can hear you from the front door.

583
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:30,570
Speak quietly.

584
01:16:34,994 --> 01:16:37,450
What are you doing?

585
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:41,450
If people see you with me, they'll doubt me.

586
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:45,450
If you have anything to say, I'll tell you in the car.

587
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:47,494
If you have anything to say, I'll tell you in the car.

588
01:16:59,578 --> 01:17:11,750
But did you burn all the books I sent you?

589
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:14,894
Yes, Your Highness.

590
01:17:15,394 --> 01:17:19,714
You're not going to collect them and threaten me later, are you?

591
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:23,210
How could I do that?

592
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,830
If this goes wrong, you'll be

593
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:26,970
caught and

594
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,370
your children will be

595
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,846
Go find the Grand Prince.

596
01:18:00,846 --> 01:18:01,846
What?

597
01:18:02,846 --> 01:18:04,846
What do you mean?

598
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,846
You're so ridiculous.

599
01:18:05,846 --> 01:18:06,846
Stand up.

600
01:18:07,846 --> 01:18:08,846
Come here.

601
01:18:11,846 --> 01:18:13,846
The doctor is here.

602
01:18:13,846 --> 01:18:21,190
Tell him that the doctor saw everything.

603
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:55,250
Sir!

604
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:57,250
Sir!

605
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:01,898
The king of the Seosan palace is in danger.

606
01:19:01,898 --> 01:19:02,898
Please save him!

607
01:19:02,898 --> 01:19:04,898
Is there anyone there?

608
01:19:05,898 --> 01:19:07,898
There is no one.

609
01:19:07,898 --> 01:19:10,898
Please save him.

610
01:19:10,898 --> 01:19:12,898
Please!

611
01:19:13,898 --> 01:19:15,898
Okay, okay.

612
01:19:15,898 --> 01:19:18,898
You go first. I'll follow you soon.

613
01:19:18,898 --> 01:19:21,898
You go first. I'll follow you soon.

614
01:19:43,002 --> 01:19:46,194
You...

615
01:19:46,194 --> 01:19:48,194
My Lord...

616
01:19:50,194 --> 01:19:54,194
You were the one who killed the Crown Prince!

617
01:19:55,194 --> 01:19:58,194
The King of Joseon, because of you!

618
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:03,362
You saw everything and lied to me!

619
01:20:03,362 --> 01:20:08,070
What's there?

620
01:20:11,002 --> 01:20:12,402
Did you see it all?

621
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:15,402
I heard it so clearly.

622
01:20:16,202 --> 01:20:17,902
What did you see?

623
01:20:17,902 --> 01:20:24,358
What did you see?

624
01:20:29,146 --> 01:20:33,646
Lee Hyung Ik poisoned the crown prince.

625
01:20:35,146 --> 01:20:39,878
The one who ordered the poisoning is the crown prince.

626
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:41,878
It's a lie!

627
01:20:42,878 --> 01:20:45,378
I should ask Grandfather right now.

628
01:20:45,878 --> 01:20:46,378
No, you can't.

629
01:20:46,378 --> 01:20:47,378
It's a lie, Your Majesty.

630
01:20:47,378 --> 01:20:49,378
Even the Empress Dowager is in danger.

631
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,378
Grandfather killed my father!

632
01:20:56,922 --> 01:20:57,922
That can't be true.

633
01:20:57,922 --> 01:21:00,826
Your Majesty, if you go to the crown prince like this,

634
01:21:00,826 --> 01:21:03,826
both the Empress Dowager and the Empress will die.

635
01:21:03,826 --> 01:21:04,826
Grandfather!

636
01:21:04,826 --> 01:21:07,826
What the crown prince said is all a lie.

637
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:08,826
Grandfather!

638
01:21:08,826 --> 01:21:09,826
Grandfather!

639
01:21:09,826 --> 01:21:10,826
Grandfather!

640
01:21:10,826 --> 01:21:14,826
I was trapped in a corner when I found out about this.

641
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,450
You saw everything.

642
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:27,190
Why didn't you tell me?

643
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:30,774
Let's go.

644
01:21:31,414 --> 01:21:34,082
Let's go.

645
01:21:34,082 --> 01:21:39,142
I didn't tell you what you saw, so my mom and dad are in jail.

646
01:21:39,622 --> 01:21:41,602
It's all because of me.

647
01:21:48,114 --> 01:21:50,778
There's a sick brother.

648
01:21:52,318 --> 01:21:54,806
If I tell you what I saw,

649
01:21:54,806 --> 01:21:57,986
my brother will die.

650
01:21:58,166 --> 01:22:04,794
You have to pretend you didn't see anything miserable like us to live.

651
01:22:05,974 --> 01:22:10,354
I closed my eyes and came all the way here, ma'am.

652
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:16,034
My dad, who I met after 10 years, is also in jail.

653
01:22:17,514 --> 01:22:20,686
My mom and dad are also in jail.

654
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:24,510
Now I have no one.

655
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:32,946
I've never seen my mother's face before.

656
01:22:34,526 --> 01:22:37,066
Didn't you say that, too?

657
01:22:52,282 --> 01:22:58,174
It's what the king of this country abandoned.

658
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:04,838
What do you want me to do?

659
01:23:35,226 --> 01:23:38,306
What should I do now?

660
01:23:40,046 --> 01:23:41,914
The king is the culprit, so I can't

661
01:23:42,914 --> 01:23:44,754
take the king.

662
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:48,114
Wait a minute.

663
01:23:48,874 --> 01:23:50,410
If it's you,

664
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:54,570
Who would believe that you saw it?

665
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,730
There's no winner.

666
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:02,130
But you're going to survive.

667
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:08,170
Is there anywhere to hide?

668
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:18,342
You're going to take the throne.

669
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:31,826
I'm sure he gave and received something.

670
01:24:31,826 --> 01:24:31,906
Wait a minute.

671
01:24:31,906 --> 01:24:36,838
I think I saw something.

672
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:57,018
My father said that my mother was poisoned by the spirit.

673
01:24:57,018 --> 01:25:00,658
That So-kyung definitely said that.

674
01:25:00,658 --> 01:25:04,166
So-kyung.

675
01:25:08,858 --> 01:25:11,458
This is the secret document that the Chief sent to Lee Young-ik.

676
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:19,014
This is not the Chief's handwriting.

677
01:25:25,114 --> 01:25:26,114
No, it's not.

678
01:25:26,374 --> 01:25:28,654
It's the handwriting of Grandmother.

679
01:25:29,174 --> 01:25:30,514
Grandmother.

680
01:25:31,974 --> 01:25:37,438
Why can't I write like this?

681
01:25:39,098 --> 01:25:41,450
Try it.

682
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:44,130
Isn't it so bad down there?

683
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:48,410
Hey, didn't you write it with your left hand?

684
01:25:51,298 --> 01:25:53,818
It's the handwriting I wrote with my left hand.

685
01:25:54,038 --> 01:25:55,758
I definitely saw it.

686
01:25:55,758 --> 01:26:00,078
This can't be a witness.

687
01:26:00,818 --> 01:26:06,158
Isn't this letter written by Grandmother a witness?

688
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:11,998
Isn't there no way to prove that this handwriting is Joo-sung's?

689
01:26:11,998 --> 01:26:21,542
If Joo-sung has a handwriting written with his left hand in front of people, he won't know.

690
01:26:29,818 --> 01:26:34,774
I can paralyze the right hand of the Lord.

691
01:26:37,466 --> 01:26:41,966
Do you know what that means?

692
01:26:42,466 --> 01:26:45,466
Guana is not a disease that can be easily cured with a single stroke.

693
01:26:45,966 --> 01:26:47,966
The paralysis symptoms will have increased by now.

694
01:26:48,466 --> 01:26:51,466
I can paralyze the right hand of the enemy I'm attacking.

695
01:26:52,466 --> 01:26:54,466
Whatever excuse you give,

696
01:26:54,966 --> 01:26:57,966
please make the Lord write with his left hand.

697
01:26:57,966 --> 01:27:05,874
I'm going to have to gather my own soldiers and make a truce.

698
01:27:06,874 --> 01:27:10,874
I'm just a messenger.

699
01:27:10,874 --> 01:27:27,502
Let's trust Sogyeong and replace the king of Joseon.

700
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:34,794
Why did you change your mind?

701
01:27:34,794 --> 01:27:39,430
It's what a suicide is.

702
01:27:48,858 --> 01:27:50,858
What are the doctors doing at this hour?

703
01:27:50,858 --> 01:27:53,858
He needs to be put on a IV drip.

704
01:27:53,858 --> 01:27:55,858
You didn't say that.

705
01:27:55,858 --> 01:27:59,858
What would you do if I told you to send him to the hospital for a IV drip?

706
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:02,994
Now?

707
01:28:02,994 --> 01:28:10,598
If you don't get it right now, you'll get paralysis all over your body.

708
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:41,830
Your Highness, I'm here to ask you to open the gate.

709
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:45,702
Open the gate.

710
01:29:27,894 --> 01:29:29,894
What's wrong with my hand?

711
01:29:30,994 --> 01:29:33,194
I can't get my hand to rest.

712
01:29:34,294 --> 01:29:37,894
It's a natural symptom that occurs during the treatment of the wind.

713
01:29:39,394 --> 01:29:40,694
As time passes, it will slowly...

714
01:29:40,694 --> 01:29:41,994
I can't do this.

715
01:29:42,694 --> 01:29:43,694
Take this out.

716
01:29:45,294 --> 01:29:47,694
Your Majesty, if you take this out now,

717
01:29:47,794 --> 01:29:49,494
paralysis will spread all over your body.

718
01:29:49,494 --> 01:29:50,494
Take it out!

719
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:54,790
If you take this out now,

720
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:57,390
you may not be able to use your arms and legs for the rest of your life.

721
01:29:57,890 --> 01:29:58,890
Your Majesty,

722
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:01,390
it's time for the sun to rise soon.

723
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:03,890
Paralysis of the right hand

724
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:07,890
is a natural reaction that occurs during the process of the disease.

725
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:08,890
Your Majesty,

726
01:30:08,890 --> 01:30:11,390
you have to perform the first ritual before the sun rises.

727
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,390
I got it. I got it.

728
01:30:12,390 --> 01:30:22,494
I have to take this out...

729
01:30:37,786 --> 01:30:39,386
I came to tell you about the transfer.

730
01:30:39,386 --> 01:30:41,086
He's being interrogated.

731
01:30:41,386 --> 01:30:42,386
Interrogated?

732
01:30:42,386 --> 01:30:44,386
What are you doing?

733
01:31:08,058 --> 01:31:12,458
Who told you to drool without permission?

734
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:14,698
What?

735
01:31:15,618 --> 01:31:16,878
I just got a

736
01:31:17,758 --> 01:31:21,018
letter saying to drool.

737
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:22,538
Send a letter.

738
01:31:22,818 --> 01:31:24,098
Who is it?

739
01:31:24,658 --> 01:31:27,098
Didn't you say you sent it?

740
01:31:28,278 --> 01:31:29,478
That guy is the

741
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:31,778
poisoner who killed

742
01:32:18,042 --> 01:32:20,042
What's your name?

743
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:26,066
I'm Kyungsoo.

744
01:32:26,066 --> 01:32:29,578
Kyungsoo.

745
01:32:29,578 --> 01:32:33,282
Just once.

746
01:32:33,282 --> 01:32:37,830
I'll ask you one more time.

747
01:33:48,474 --> 01:33:49,474
Let's go.

748
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:03,198
This way!

749
01:34:45,178 --> 01:34:47,178
What are you talking about?

750
01:35:13,402 --> 01:35:17,602
500 soldiers who are on the hunt at Hongpansae in Dosong Market have gathered.

751
01:35:19,902 --> 01:35:21,634
What happened to the antidote?

752
01:35:21,634 --> 01:35:23,134
We found out from the chief.

753
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:26,334
But fortunately, the soldier ran away with the antidote.

754
01:35:26,334 --> 01:35:27,334
Ran away?

755
01:35:27,834 --> 01:35:28,834
To where?

756
01:35:28,834 --> 01:35:30,034
I don't know.

757
01:35:30,034 --> 01:35:32,734
We're supposed to meet at the main battlefield, so let's go there first.

758
01:35:32,734 --> 01:35:33,734
No.

759
01:35:33,734 --> 01:35:37,034
We might lose our lives if we trust the lieutenant.

760
01:35:37,034 --> 01:35:41,638
We have to get rid of the soldiers right now.

761
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:22,150
This way!

762
01:36:50,650 --> 01:36:52,650
What's going on?

763
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:17,922
It's just a dog's nest.

764
01:37:17,922 --> 01:37:20,322
Where would Chief go?

765
01:37:20,322 --> 01:37:24,166
We'll find out.

766
01:37:28,698 --> 01:37:31,258
Go to Byulgam who's keeping the rumor

767
01:37:31,258 --> 01:37:35,258
If I say I sent it, I'll let you go.

768
01:38:01,018 --> 01:38:02,718
What's going on?

769
01:38:02,718 --> 01:38:04,918
I know. It's a mess.

770
01:38:04,918 --> 01:38:06,918
The Crown Prince is dead.

771
01:38:06,918 --> 01:38:08,258
I'm so scared.

772
01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:09,858
Shut up.

773
01:38:09,858 --> 01:38:12,358
I heard the Queen Mother is sick too.

774
01:38:12,358 --> 01:38:18,278
That's why Lee Yeong-ui was called urgently.

775
01:38:44,986 --> 01:38:46,986
You son of a bitch!

776
01:39:02,618 --> 01:39:09,694
I'm going to kill you.

777
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:39,330
Sir!

778
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:40,330
Sir!

779
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:51,042
Your Majesty.

780
01:40:51,922 --> 01:40:54,074
Your Majesty.

781
01:40:54,414 --> 01:40:56,414
I heard you can't see.

782
01:40:57,534 --> 01:41:00,394
You must have run away from home, you bastard.

783
01:41:01,674 --> 01:41:04,854
I've never seen you, I've never heard of you.

784
01:41:05,514 --> 01:41:08,054
I'm just trying to help you.

785
01:41:09,994 --> 01:41:13,034
Why are you getting involved in this?

786
01:41:13,034 --> 01:41:19,598
Give me the memorial.

787
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:27,810
Who told you to do this?

788
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:31,010
Did Choi Dae-gang tell you to do this?

789
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:33,810
Kill me and move the memorial?

790
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:39,750
Or Kang Bin.

791
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:45,414
She tried to kill me and take my place by kidnapping my son.

792
01:41:45,414 --> 01:41:48,694
Now you're going to put this guy in my place?

793
01:41:50,014 --> 01:41:52,394
What did you say?

794
01:41:52,754 --> 01:41:55,814
You said you'd give me a position of loyalty.

795
01:41:58,614 --> 01:42:02,314
Tell me, who told you to do this.

796
01:42:02,314 --> 01:42:07,334
Who told you to kill me.

797
01:42:17,946 --> 01:42:20,546
Did you come all the way here to find me?

798
01:42:20,546 --> 01:42:23,946
Or did you come all the way here to find a place to hide?

799
01:42:26,186 --> 01:42:31,726
You have a good face.

800
01:42:32,266 --> 01:42:36,966
I can't tell what you're thinking.

801
01:42:37,266 --> 01:42:41,266
You don't look so good.

802
01:42:41,266 --> 01:42:50,218
If you come down from the throne now, I'll spare your life.

803
01:42:50,218 --> 01:42:54,218
I'm your king.

804
01:42:54,218 --> 01:42:58,218
Where does the king go?

805
01:42:58,218 --> 01:43:02,218
Did you forget who sat on the throne?

806
01:43:02,218 --> 01:43:08,218
Yes, and now you're going to sleep with the crown prince and kill me.

807
01:43:08,218 --> 01:43:17,106
There are martyrs outside the city of Hanyang.

808
01:43:17,106 --> 01:43:23,106
Who will be the king who killed his son?

809
01:43:23,106 --> 01:43:25,106
Martyrs, come on.

810
01:43:25,106 --> 01:43:27,106
Give me.

811
01:43:27,106 --> 01:43:32,106
Then the Orangke guys will leave you alone.

812
01:43:32,106 --> 01:43:38,106
What if they kill us all and build the king of Orangke?

813
01:43:38,106 --> 01:43:42,106
I'm not going to die.

814
01:43:42,106 --> 01:43:46,562
We need to join forces.

815
01:43:46,562 --> 01:43:50,562
How many more years will I last if I endure it?

816
01:43:50,562 --> 01:43:54,562
If I die, I'm your crown prince anyway.

817
01:43:54,562 --> 01:44:02,562
How do I know when your heart will change?

818
01:44:02,562 --> 01:44:11,722
But do you believe in who the crown prince is?

819
01:44:30,874 --> 01:44:37,222
That's what it looks like.

820
01:44:42,362 --> 01:44:45,722
What are you going to do with the enemy?

821
01:44:47,002 --> 01:44:49,858
If I let him go now,

822
01:44:49,858 --> 01:44:56,550
I'll set up a trap to get revenge on my father.

823
01:45:08,346 --> 01:45:10,346
If it's a sunset, let it be a sunset.

824
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:15,110
Close your eyes and live.

825
01:45:27,610 --> 01:45:29,610
There is no one to kill.

826
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:35,582
The crown prince died of scabies.

827
01:45:35,582 --> 01:45:42,790
Take the prince and treat him.

828
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:07,986
I brought it.

829
01:46:24,794 --> 01:46:28,234
The evidence is with you, sir.

830
01:46:29,674 --> 01:46:32,090
I saw it for sure.

831
01:46:33,490 --> 01:46:39,318
The chief is trying to kill that prince.

832
01:46:40,738 --> 01:46:43,094
I saw it.

833
01:46:44,394 --> 01:46:46,430
I saw it for sure.

834
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:49,566
How.

835
01:46:50,266 --> 01:46:53,958
How can a father kill his son.

836
01:46:53,958 --> 01:47:03,454
What are you listening to.

837
01:47:04,914 --> 01:47:09,934
Kill the one who's pulling him right now.

838
01:47:12,434 --> 01:47:15,990
I saw it for sure.

839
01:47:17,450 --> 01:47:19,350
I saw it.

840
01:47:19,570 --> 01:47:21,310
Didn't you hear me?

841
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:24,510
Didn't you hear me?

842
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:27,310
Pull him right now and surrender.

843
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:29,050
I saw it.

844
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:31,530
Pull him right now.

845
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:33,490
What are you doing.

846
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:36,050
Pull him right now.

847
01:49:11,482 --> 01:49:12,482
What are you doing?

848
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:32,010
You saw everything, didn't you?

849
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:34,010
What did my ancestor do?

850
01:50:00,346 --> 01:50:02,346
You're a disgrace.

851
01:50:02,946 --> 01:50:04,546
You're a disgrace.

852
01:50:05,946 --> 01:50:07,346
Look at that.

853
01:50:07,346 --> 01:50:09,346
Look at that.

854
01:50:11,046 --> 01:50:12,846
You're a disgrace.

855
01:50:14,246 --> 01:50:16,146
You're a disgrace.

856
01:50:20,786 --> 01:50:22,786
Wait here while you eat this.

857
01:50:23,286 --> 01:50:24,286
Here.

858
01:50:27,686 --> 01:50:28,686
Did you hear?

859
01:50:28,686 --> 01:50:30,686
The king collapsed.

860
01:50:30,686 --> 01:50:31,686
The king?

861
01:50:31,686 --> 01:50:32,686
Yes.

862
01:50:32,686 --> 01:50:34,686
So he's looking for a name.

863
01:50:34,686 --> 01:50:35,686
Oh, really?

864
01:50:35,686 --> 01:50:37,186
Yes.

865
01:50:37,186 --> 01:50:39,186
A disgrace.

866
01:51:16,826 --> 01:51:22,346
I called a member of the committee who said he would cause a death by drooling.

867
01:51:22,346 --> 01:51:36,166
I'll be on my way.

868
01:51:41,946 --> 01:51:47,886
Oh, you're here to kill me.

869
01:51:48,766 --> 01:51:52,986
Hey, hey, hey.

870
01:51:53,486 --> 01:51:56,566
Hey. I'm sorry.

871
01:51:56,566 --> 01:52:01,326
Who told you to kill me.

872
01:52:01,326 --> 01:52:12,902
It's starting again.

873
01:53:03,546 --> 01:53:06,346
What do you see?
