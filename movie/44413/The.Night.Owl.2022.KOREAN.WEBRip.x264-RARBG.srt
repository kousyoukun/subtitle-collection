2
00:03:12,506 --> 00:03:14,226
Thank you.

3
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,210
Did you prepare a lot for the exam?

4
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:30,913
I have to quit drinking or I can't.

5
00:03:30,914 --> 00:03:35,934
If you go into the palace and get
married, you'll fix your life.

6
00:03:36,354 --> 00:03:38,654
I heard you're going to
hire a drunkard this time.

7
00:03:39,194 --> 00:03:41,993
You know the guy who went
into the palace last year?

8
00:03:41,994 --> 00:03:43,993
He bought a house.

9
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:45,993
How much is it?

10
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:47,993
It's a big deal.

11
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:51,994
Oh, I'm going to be nice
to the crown prince.

12
00:03:52,994 --> 00:03:55,793
Why?

13
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:57,793
Are you going to take the exam?

14
00:03:57,794 --> 00:04:00,793
Yes, I can see it.

15
00:04:00,794 --> 00:04:03,793
Yeah, Kyungsoo should fix his life now.

16
00:04:03,794 --> 00:04:06,793
Of course, Kyungsoo should fix his life.

17
00:04:06,794 --> 00:04:10,793
Hurry up and finish it and get
ready to get a five-month-old.

18
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:11,794
Oh, yes, yes.

19
00:04:11,795 --> 00:04:13,793
Oh, he's here. He's here.

20
00:04:13,794 --> 00:04:21,442
He's Lee Hyung-ik from the palace.

21
00:04:40,442 --> 00:04:46,802
The irregularity of the pulse
seems to have a problem.

22
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:52,442
You need more oxygen?

23
00:04:52,443 --> 00:04:55,603
If you don't do the test right away, it
will be difficult to get through today.

24
00:04:56,442 --> 00:04:57,442
Do the test right away.

25
00:04:59,442 --> 00:05:02,442
This thread is not the
thread I usually use.

26
00:05:04,442 --> 00:05:07,441
I think it's more of a problem
of the mind than the body.

27
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:11,186
Hey, let's take a look at the body.

28
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:13,186
I've seen enough.

29
00:05:14,186 --> 00:05:15,186
It seems to be wind.

30
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:19,186
It's not safe.

31
00:05:21,186 --> 00:05:22,186
Is it a small dog?

32
00:05:23,186 --> 00:05:24,186
What do you do with that?

33
00:05:26,482 --> 00:05:28,970
I heard footsteps earlier,
and I was limping.

34
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:35,969
The short and irregular breathing interval seems to be a short
temper and lack of patience, so it seems to be blowing.

35
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,970
Can you do that without
even having a diagnosis?

36
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:43,490
It's all nonsense to diagnose
with a thread in the first place.

37
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:48,937
Writing a poem is just a premeditation from the
aspect that can't diagnose the inner-body.

38
00:05:48,938 --> 00:05:56,938
In fact, you will have to diagnose
through a conversation with a patient.

39
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:08,098
If it were you, where would you be?

40
00:06:55,002 --> 00:07:00,162
Hey, did I tell you not to run?

41
00:07:00,242 --> 00:07:01,641
You're a good kid.

42
00:07:01,642 --> 00:07:03,001
You're a good kid.

43
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:04,861
You're so good at everything.

44
00:07:04,862 --> 00:07:06,841
Kyungsoo, you're so lucky.

45
00:07:06,842 --> 00:07:09,881
I knew it would work out someday.

46
00:07:09,882 --> 00:07:12,242
Don't work so hard.

47
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:14,802
Eat.

48
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:21,441
When a person lives
honestly, good things happen.

49
00:07:21,442 --> 00:07:23,921
Here you go.

50
00:07:23,922 --> 00:07:25,102
One.

51
00:07:25,782 --> 00:07:27,781
What's wrong?

52
00:07:27,782 --> 00:07:29,341
No, it's not.

53
00:07:29,342 --> 00:07:30,441
Thank you.

54
00:07:30,442 --> 00:07:32,801
Why do you always stay still?

55
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:40,802
Everything will be fine as
long as you become a mother.

56
00:07:49,306 --> 00:07:50,306
It's good, right?

57
00:07:50,306 --> 00:07:51,306
Yeah.

58
00:07:53,378 --> 00:07:57,377
When you go to the palace, you can buy
a house and fix your financial problems.

59
00:07:57,378 --> 00:07:59,378
Everything will be fine.

60
00:08:00,378 --> 00:08:05,378
Kyung-jae, if you go to the palace this
time, you can't come out for a while.

61
00:08:06,378 --> 00:08:08,377
Why? How much?

62
00:08:08,378 --> 00:08:13,377
If you go to the palace for the first time, you'll
learn a lot, so you'll be out after a month.

63
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:16,377
Instead, you can go around
the house after a month.

64
00:08:16,378 --> 00:08:19,377
You told me to dig up the grass when I
went to the mountain to dig up the grass.

65
00:08:19,378 --> 00:08:22,377
Hey, that's a grass digger.

66
00:08:22,378 --> 00:08:26,377
You said you wanted to eat that,
so you're going to dig it up.

67
00:08:26,378 --> 00:08:31,174
Did you enjoy it or not?

68
00:08:33,978 --> 00:08:36,578
Young-ju, are you okay?

69
00:08:48,698 --> 00:08:49,698
You bastard!

70
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,697
If you go in there and get a beating,

71
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:53,698
you can pay for everything
you've been pushed for.

72
00:08:54,698 --> 00:08:56,697
Just wait for the arrival.

73
00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:59,698
What are you talking about?

74
00:09:01,698 --> 00:09:04,697
You know that if you don't
have a heart, you'll die.

75
00:09:04,698 --> 00:09:12,698
You've been pushed so far, but
you don't have a conscience.

76
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,766
You have to take your medicine without me.

77
00:09:26,026 --> 00:09:31,722
I have no one without you.

78
00:09:33,582 --> 00:09:35,821
Why don't you have me?

79
00:09:35,822 --> 00:09:41,350
Sweet sleep, sweet sleep.

80
00:10:22,106 --> 00:10:24,105
Hey, Hong Hyesung!

81
00:10:24,106 --> 00:10:27,605
You pretend you didn't
hear or see anything!

82
00:10:27,606 --> 00:10:31,105
Oh, you don't care, do you?

83
00:10:31,106 --> 00:10:35,606
Anyway, you should always be careful.

84
00:10:39,406 --> 00:10:42,505
You know I'm handsome.

85
00:10:42,506 --> 00:10:43,905
So that you can understand,

86
00:10:43,906 --> 00:10:48,705
I'm a little bit of a woman's type.

87
00:10:48,706 --> 00:10:52,606
But isn't the other side of the military?

88
00:10:56,474 --> 00:11:00,814
Yes, this is the new shortcut.

89
00:11:11,162 --> 00:11:13,361
This way.

90
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:18,062
If you think you have
to answer, just say yes.

91
00:11:20,762 --> 00:11:23,861
In the palace, there are
roads that we can walk on.

92
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:25,761
There are roads that we can't walk on.

93
00:11:25,762 --> 00:11:28,461
So you have to stay alert.

94
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:30,461
Especially the inner palace.

95
00:11:30,462 --> 00:11:33,462
You can't even talk in the inner palace.

96
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:37,361
Now, be careful.

97
00:11:37,362 --> 00:11:39,961
This is the inner palace.

98
00:11:39,962 --> 00:11:42,161
Over there is the medicine room.

99
00:11:42,162 --> 00:11:44,762
And over there is the storage room.

100
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:49,061
You can't see, right?

101
00:11:49,062 --> 00:11:50,861
Come this way.

102
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:52,461
Here.

103
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,461
Here. Here. Here.

104
00:11:54,462 --> 00:11:55,961
Sit here.

105
00:11:55,962 --> 00:11:58,161
That's right. That's right.

106
00:11:58,162 --> 00:11:59,361
Sit here for a while.

107
00:11:59,362 --> 00:12:03,362
I'll bring you your clothes.

108
00:13:03,482 --> 00:13:05,522
How dare you touch my stuff
as soon as you came in?

109
00:13:06,842 --> 00:13:08,842
You don't even know what this is

110
00:13:11,186 --> 00:13:13,185
Be gentle, gentle

111
00:13:13,186 --> 00:13:15,185
You're touching the
poison without permission

112
00:13:15,186 --> 00:13:17,185
Do you think I touched it
because I knew it was poison?

113
00:13:17,186 --> 00:13:23,206
I'll give you a hard time,
so let's move on this time

114
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:30,426
That little rat is so stubborn.

115
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:33,865
Sit down, sit down.

116
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:36,026
Sit down, sit down.

117
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:42,566
The inner court is a place that deals with
human life, so the hierarchy is fierce.

118
00:13:44,646 --> 00:13:50,270
But why is there poison in the inner court?

119
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,190
How can I make it with chemicals?

120
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:54,289
Oh, my.

121
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:57,730
Eat, eat, eat.

122
00:13:57,930 --> 00:14:00,969
You know you have to write a
check every two days, right?

123
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:04,729
I'm not sleepy, so I'll help
you for the first few days.

124
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:10,374
Don't worry too much.

125
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:30,330
If you're sleepy, go to sleep

126
00:14:34,382 --> 00:14:35,781
I can't sleep while I'm on duty

127
00:14:35,782 --> 00:14:37,782
I'm going to read a book over there

128
00:14:45,594 --> 00:14:49,093
Oh, you don't need a light, do you?

129
00:14:49,094 --> 00:14:53,062
I'll turn off all the lights.

130
00:14:55,578 --> 00:14:57,678
You're so quick-witted.

131
00:16:15,322 --> 00:16:21,761
Gyeongje, it's still very cold
at night, but how are you doing?

132
00:16:21,762 --> 00:16:27,241
It's only been a day, but it
feels like it's been a full moon.

133
00:16:27,242 --> 00:16:31,161
The people of my hospital
are all kind and good people.

134
00:16:31,162 --> 00:16:39,162
It's comfortable and nice to stay
with Samchi's meat side dish.

135
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:14,146
Hey, Jin Chang.

136
00:17:14,147 --> 00:17:17,066
Put all the drugs here, okay?

137
00:17:18,426 --> 00:17:20,825
Hey, how can you do this to So-kyung?

138
00:17:20,826 --> 00:17:26,854
That's why I'm making you do it.

139
00:18:02,618 --> 00:18:06,417
If you wait for me, I'll
buy you something delicious.

140
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:13,030
So you have to take your
medicine and stay healthy.

141
00:18:16,218 --> 00:18:22,838
Why are you so excited?

142
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:24,958
What are you excited about?

143
00:18:26,738 --> 00:18:28,938
There are only a few days left.

144
00:18:29,118 --> 00:18:30,978
The day the crown prince will come.

145
00:18:31,118 --> 00:18:36,878
It's been 8 years since the crown
prince was taken to the Qing Dynasty.

146
00:18:37,278 --> 00:18:42,398
The crown prince was taken to the Qing Dynasty and
the queen couldn't even see her parents alone.

147
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:44,637
That disease at that young age.

148
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:46,438
Pyeongyang.

149
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,070
It's a secret only the
people of the palace know.

150
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:04,150
The Queen Mother can't cover her
urine until she's over 10 years old.

151
00:19:05,150 --> 00:19:07,170
You must never tell anyone.

152
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:12,226
Yes.

153
00:19:13,066 --> 00:19:16,786
Your Majesty So-yong has
a severe stomachache.

154
00:19:18,166 --> 00:19:25,025
Your Majesty So-yong, I'll call the maid.

155
00:19:25,026 --> 00:19:28,666
Forget it. I have a hobby.

156
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:46,498
What are you doing?

157
00:19:46,499 --> 00:19:49,606
I'm not going to say hello.

158
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,665
Is this a new volunteer?

159
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,665
Yes, your highness.

160
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,666
Thank you.

161
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:43,178
My arm is frozen and I can't digest it.

162
00:20:44,938 --> 00:20:50,161
I'll try it in the middle.

163
00:20:50,162 --> 00:20:54,694
That's right.

164
00:21:28,666 --> 00:21:32,230
Will it end today?

165
00:22:14,938 --> 00:22:18,237
You've picked a good hobby this time.

166
00:22:18,238 --> 00:22:20,438
I'm Hwang Song-hwa, Your Majesty.

167
00:22:22,546 --> 00:22:26,246
The Crown Prince's men
have passed the post.

168
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:30,633
I heard the Crown Prince is
coming back from the palace.

169
00:22:30,634 --> 00:22:33,133
I guess my body is reacting first.

170
00:22:33,134 --> 00:22:36,533
Your body is cold because
you've been over-stressed.

171
00:22:36,534 --> 00:22:39,533
It's best to take it easy.

172
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:41,533
I'm not worried.

173
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:45,906
I'm worried about my son.

174
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,210
It's from the school across the street.

175
00:23:36,986 --> 00:23:38,186
Did you see everything?

176
00:23:41,234 --> 00:23:43,433
If you tell people that you saw me,

177
00:23:43,434 --> 00:23:44,434
they'll scold you.

178
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,349
Your Highness!

179
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,749
Your Highness!

180
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,950
Your Highness!

181
00:23:53,350 --> 00:23:55,150
Did you see Her Highness?

182
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,490
I'm So Gyeong.

183
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:02,469
Your Highness!

184
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:04,069
Your Highness!

185
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:05,670
Your Highness!

186
00:24:19,834 --> 00:24:23,074
Do you really not see anything?

187
00:24:25,238 --> 00:24:26,238
Yes, your highness

188
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:28,538
Since when?

189
00:24:29,258 --> 00:24:31,218
I haven't seen anything since I was born

190
00:24:31,578 --> 00:24:32,578
Then...

191
00:24:33,058 --> 00:24:36,497
Have you never seen your parents?

192
00:24:36,498 --> 00:24:44,390
Yes, I haven't seen anything

193
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:18,198
What about the tonic?

194
00:25:18,498 --> 00:25:21,697
Father said he's already
over the limit of the tonic

195
00:25:21,698 --> 00:25:22,698
It's all done

196
00:25:22,998 --> 00:25:24,498
If you drink it yourself,

197
00:25:24,798 --> 00:25:27,198
the Crown Prince will be even happier

198
00:25:28,998 --> 00:25:32,469
It's my hobby

199
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:34,470
It's my hobby

200
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:41,437
Your Majesty, the time has come to leave.

201
00:25:41,438 --> 00:25:43,438
Let's go! Let's go!

202
00:26:01,114 --> 00:26:03,814
Why isn't Ma Jung Na Eun here?

203
00:26:46,426 --> 00:26:54,426
If you are so loyal that you can't even greet the crown prince who has
returned after 8 years, I, the king, will have to check the king's condition.

204
00:26:58,246 --> 00:27:00,658
Follow me.

205
00:27:01,038 --> 00:27:06,058
If you take one step there,
your necks will fly away.

206
00:27:06,138 --> 00:27:10,178
The king is sick, what are you doing here?

207
00:27:10,818 --> 00:27:13,097
This is the king's bed.

208
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:17,358
You should just mind your own business.

209
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:41,018
If I can't even take care of the company
of the head of the Yeomijung, I'll resign.

210
00:28:04,762 --> 00:28:08,362
The Crown Prince and the
Cheongnara assassin have arrived.

211
00:28:17,626 --> 00:28:20,826
Now the world where the Qing Dynasty
dominates the world has come.

212
00:28:21,146 --> 00:28:25,006
Since the Crown Prince came back
with such a gun on his back,

213
00:28:26,386 --> 00:28:30,786
where could there be a
deeper thing than this?

214
00:28:32,306 --> 00:28:37,401
Your Highness, the Crown
Prince has arrived.

215
00:28:37,402 --> 00:28:42,662
Your Highness.

216
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:13,158
You've had a hard time, son.

217
00:30:48,186 --> 00:30:50,186
Let's go!

218
00:31:03,186 --> 00:31:07,626
Welcome, Seol Gyeong-bi.

219
00:31:09,794 --> 00:31:10,794
Go ahead.

220
00:31:11,794 --> 00:31:12,794
What do you want?

221
00:31:12,795 --> 00:31:20,795
I want to talk to you.

222
00:31:22,282 --> 00:31:23,282
Go ahead.

223
00:31:24,282 --> 00:31:29,570
What does he want?

224
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:32,569
He wants me to translate.

225
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:33,570
Go ahead.

226
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:38,897
Go ahead!

227
00:31:38,898 --> 00:31:41,898
Translate before the situation gets worse.

228
00:32:19,278 --> 00:32:26,086
If you think about what you did
to Jim in Namsan 8 years ago...

229
00:32:32,858 --> 00:32:38,506
It would be right to destroy
you as the King of Joseon.

230
00:32:53,882 --> 00:32:56,081
I'll give you the things
over there as a gift.

231
00:32:56,082 --> 00:32:57,481
I'll organize them for you.

232
00:32:57,482 --> 00:32:59,382
Yes, I understand.

233
00:33:01,282 --> 00:33:03,082
The things over there...

234
00:33:04,082 --> 00:33:05,481
This is the second room...

235
00:33:05,482 --> 00:33:07,681
It's so pretty.

236
00:33:07,682 --> 00:33:10,982
It hasn't changed at all.

237
00:33:11,982 --> 00:33:13,281
Is there a guest?

238
00:33:13,282 --> 00:33:14,282
Yes.

239
00:33:14,282 --> 00:33:15,282
Oh, my.

240
00:33:16,382 --> 00:33:17,682
You startled me.

241
00:33:19,082 --> 00:33:21,081
We almost got in trouble.

242
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,581
We left the Cheongnara's
body in front of us

243
00:33:23,582 --> 00:33:25,082
and you say it's a body?

244
00:33:26,874 --> 00:33:29,074
The Cheongsa people speak well of Joseon.

245
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:31,973
If they speak of Cheongnara,

246
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:37,574
it means that they have become
the owners of the country.

247
00:33:39,774 --> 00:33:42,173
The 8 years you've spent in Cheongnara

248
00:33:42,174 --> 00:33:44,674
doesn't seem like a short time.

249
00:33:47,882 --> 00:33:53,981
You should prepare for a new era.

250
00:33:53,982 --> 00:33:55,381
A new era?

251
00:33:55,382 --> 00:33:57,581
The name that Joseon had was ruined

252
00:33:57,582 --> 00:34:01,181
and now Cheongnara has become
the owner of the country.

253
00:34:01,182 --> 00:34:03,681
Shouldn't Joseon accept the
body of the late King Sok-hui

254
00:34:03,682 --> 00:34:07,882
and change according to the times?

255
00:34:08,982 --> 00:34:10,981
We must change everything.

256
00:34:10,982 --> 00:34:14,781
If we don't change, Joseon will die.

257
00:34:14,782 --> 00:34:17,781
The problem is what the King has decided.

258
00:34:17,782 --> 00:34:20,381
Do you know what the
situation is like this year?

259
00:34:20,382 --> 00:34:24,382
The people of Hwanghaedo are starving.

260
00:34:31,034 --> 00:34:32,794
The crown prince,

261
00:34:33,774 --> 00:34:35,314
for the sake of Joseon,

262
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:38,530
please sign the agreement.

263
00:34:39,010 --> 00:34:40,570
Are you telling me

264
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:46,586
to drive your father out and take Yongsang?

265
00:34:48,026 --> 00:34:52,066
Oh, that's not possible.

266
00:34:53,406 --> 00:34:54,406
But

267
00:34:54,407 --> 00:35:02,407
it meant that you should
always be prepared.

268
00:35:02,926 --> 00:35:05,126
What are you doing?

269
00:35:06,886 --> 00:35:09,310
What are you going to do now?

270
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,678
If the road is blocked,

271
00:35:13,058 --> 00:35:14,878
we have to make a new road.

272
00:35:16,038 --> 00:35:19,837
This is the true appearance
of the land where we live.

273
00:35:19,838 --> 00:35:26,838
People come here by boat to the border
and exchange new things and books.

274
00:35:27,538 --> 00:35:28,538
This is

275
00:35:28,838 --> 00:35:30,237
Joseon.

276
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:31,437
This little land.

277
00:35:31,438 --> 00:35:36,006
That's what they taught me.

278
00:35:40,058 --> 00:35:47,058
Father, the Qing Dynasty is growing
day by day, accepting Western culture.

279
00:35:47,638 --> 00:35:50,437
Don't cling to the past
and look at the future.

280
00:35:50,438 --> 00:35:54,657
Don't you know why I'm wearing this?

281
00:35:54,658 --> 00:35:58,298
Do you still have the Naman
Mountain 8 years ago in your heart?

282
00:35:58,818 --> 00:35:59,878
No, I don't.

283
00:36:01,298 --> 00:36:03,586
Still.

284
00:36:04,746 --> 00:36:06,222
We have to follow

285
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,121
the order.

286
00:36:09,122 --> 00:36:13,722
That's the way to find your and my authenticity
and to reveal the future of Joseon.

287
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:17,802
The order is already ruined.

288
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:21,082
I saw it with my own eyes
in the northern border.

289
00:36:22,582 --> 00:36:29,985
Father, don't pursue a false justification and
accept the Qing Dynasty as a bus and a newspaper.

290
00:36:29,986 --> 00:36:33,025
That's the way to make
Joseon work and for you.

291
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:36,906
What are you talking about for me?

292
00:36:37,626 --> 00:36:39,385
As a bus.

293
00:36:39,386 --> 00:36:41,386
As a bus.

294
00:36:42,546 --> 00:36:46,793
We have to change it.

295
00:36:46,794 --> 00:36:54,794
If we can't change it, Joseon will die.

296
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:06,666
Your eyes have changed

297
00:37:17,498 --> 00:37:20,298
Are you still sleeping
because of the cough?

298
00:37:21,558 --> 00:37:23,666
I'm fine.

299
00:37:24,486 --> 00:37:27,025
Pull out a reliable doctor
and keep him by your side.

300
00:37:27,026 --> 00:37:31,878
Treat him consistently.

301
00:37:42,458 --> 00:37:44,457
I heard a lot about my original hand.

302
00:37:44,458 --> 00:37:47,457
You took good care of the original hand.

303
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:49,457
I just did what I had to do.

304
00:37:49,458 --> 00:37:52,457
Your Highness has been on a long
journey and your body is very damaged.

305
00:37:52,458 --> 00:37:55,458
Can you take care of my treatment?

306
00:37:56,458 --> 00:38:00,105
I'm not good enough, but I'll do my best.
Your Highness.

307
00:38:00,106 --> 00:38:03,718
Thank you.

308
00:38:06,938 --> 00:38:10,538
I'm your father, Cheon Bong Sa, who
will help you to spit accurately.

309
00:38:12,138 --> 00:38:16,290
Oh, you're So Gyeong.

310
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:22,394
Your Majesty, So Gyeong
is better at spitting.

311
00:38:23,994 --> 00:38:25,794
I didn't know that.

312
00:38:26,594 --> 00:38:28,193
I'm looking forward to working
with you, Cheon Bong Sa.

313
00:38:28,194 --> 00:38:32,902
Yes, mother.

314
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:04,250
You're the Duke of Seosan
who serves the Crown Prince.

315
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:07,050
Where is the King?

316
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,850
Yes, he has left the palace.

317
00:39:10,650 --> 00:39:12,449
His Majesty is coughing a lot.

318
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:13,750
Follow me.

319
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:16,289
Well, according to the law of the palace,

320
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:17,949
I can't treat him alone.

321
00:39:17,950 --> 00:39:20,649
He's sick. Why does the law matter so much?

322
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:24,742
Follow me.

323
00:39:28,538 --> 00:39:32,390
Cough, cough, cough.

324
00:39:35,066 --> 00:39:37,066
I heard your lung is badly damaged.

325
00:39:38,266 --> 00:39:39,866
Can you fix it?

326
00:39:40,966 --> 00:39:43,866
It's just a hobby.

327
00:39:45,566 --> 00:39:47,738
I think you have something to say.

328
00:39:49,338 --> 00:39:51,862
No, Your Majesty.

329
00:39:53,462 --> 00:39:55,413
Say it.

330
00:39:55,414 --> 00:40:01,702
You're a doctor who pretends not
to have seen a patient's illness.

331
00:40:11,962 --> 00:40:17,441
His body is stiffened and hardened.

332
00:40:17,442 --> 00:40:20,441
It's because of the excessive
feed, so the blood can't circulate.

333
00:40:20,442 --> 00:40:28,326
You need to take a load off
your mind to recover your body.

334
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,701
Open the window for me.

335
00:40:32,702 --> 00:40:39,654
I think I'm already coughing.

336
00:40:53,146 --> 00:40:57,406
Father, you must have gotten cold.

337
00:40:58,646 --> 00:41:01,445
Can you take a look at him?

338
00:41:01,446 --> 00:41:06,886
How dare a crazy man
like him call the king?

339
00:41:13,850 --> 00:41:15,849
I beg you.

340
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:19,905
Yes, In-seong.

341
00:41:19,906 --> 00:41:22,010
Thank you.

342
00:41:32,538 --> 00:41:37,418
This time, I'll do a blood test
to release the clotted energy.

343
00:41:49,242 --> 00:41:50,242
You can see it.

344
00:41:51,518 --> 00:41:52,658
No, trust me.

345
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:55,318
Are you trying to fool me?

346
00:41:57,398 --> 00:41:59,237
How dare I lie to you?

347
00:41:59,238 --> 00:42:04,230
You're going to lie to me until the end?

348
00:42:11,514 --> 00:42:13,514
I don't want to be a burden anymore.

349
00:42:19,482 --> 00:42:21,482
Let's go.

350
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:37,586
Cough, cough, cough

351
00:43:12,154 --> 00:43:15,514
How did you write a letter to your
brother when you couldn't see him?

352
00:43:16,094 --> 00:43:24,094
It's hard for you to believe me, but I know a disease that can
be seen a little in bright places and a little in dark places.

353
00:43:25,154 --> 00:43:27,834
I deserve to die, but my

354
00:43:28,754 --> 00:43:32,234
sick brother dies without me.

355
00:43:32,314 --> 00:43:33,674
Please save me.

356
00:43:34,394 --> 00:43:38,513
Why did you say you couldn't
see him when you could?

357
00:43:38,514 --> 00:43:44,014
People don't like to see the sunset.

358
00:43:45,534 --> 00:43:49,606
How old is your brother?

359
00:43:49,826 --> 00:43:54,949
He's 10 years old.

360
00:43:54,950 --> 00:44:00,486
You're the same age as our original hand.

361
00:44:07,802 --> 00:44:09,482
What would you do?

362
00:44:10,922 --> 00:44:13,402
Didn't you?

363
00:44:13,602 --> 00:44:15,522
I have a disease in my heart.

364
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:21,194
What should I do to get
rid of this disease?

365
00:44:21,354 --> 00:44:25,354
I was talking nonsense
without knowing the score.

366
00:44:26,614 --> 00:44:28,538
Are you going to pretend

367
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:31,158
you don't know and pretend you don't see?

368
00:44:32,578 --> 00:44:33,998
Sometimes it's better to

369
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,217
close your eyes and live.

370
00:44:38,218 --> 00:44:41,721
Are you telling me to be a small dog?

371
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:46,822
Do you have to live with your eyes
closed for people as high as me?

372
00:44:47,602 --> 00:44:52,022
You have to pretend you don't know or pretend
you don't see people as low as a small person

373
00:44:52,502 --> 00:44:54,802
to get into the palace like this.

374
00:44:56,102 --> 00:44:58,670
You're sick because you've

375
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:01,010
seen everything so

376
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:02,890
well.

377
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:07,817
Seo Sang-gong,

378
00:45:07,818 --> 00:45:11,718
turn off the lights.

379
00:45:25,370 --> 00:45:27,050
It's called enlargement.

380
00:45:28,490 --> 00:45:32,006
You wrote the wrong letters

381
00:45:32,566 --> 00:45:34,465
very hard.

382
00:45:34,466 --> 00:45:41,958
You should know how to write
properly to become a doctor.

383
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:54,818
They say it's good for you
to live without looking.

384
00:45:55,718 --> 00:45:57,918
Can I just live with my eyes closed?

385
00:45:59,198 --> 00:46:00,337
The more I do that,

386
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:05,350
the more I have to open my eyes wide.

387
00:46:18,202 --> 00:46:21,002
I'm so glad you're coughing.

388
00:46:22,042 --> 00:46:26,001
Since there's still a little fever left, I
prepared a small hot pot to cool down the fever.

389
00:46:26,002 --> 00:46:32,486
I guess the medical staff ran away
because they were afraid of the disease.

390
00:46:40,410 --> 00:46:41,410
Is this the right place?

391
00:46:41,410 --> 00:46:42,410
Yes, it is.

392
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:48,409
Mr. Choong, the Crown Prince has awarded
you for your excellent physical ability.

393
00:46:48,410 --> 00:46:52,409
It's a very precious medicine used for the
heart disease that the Blue House brought.

394
00:46:52,410 --> 00:46:59,174
It will be of great help to
your younger brother's disease.

395
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:06,749
Wow, I didn't see it that
way, but it's fast, it's fast.

396
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,049
If it goes well later,
I can't pretend I don't know.

397
00:47:10,050 --> 00:47:11,489
I'll go home the day after tomorrow, right?

398
00:47:11,490 --> 00:47:13,089
Wow, you too.

399
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:14,810
I'm so happy.

400
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:58,490
But isn't it the crown prince who has
a friendly relationship with the Qing?

401
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:04,490
If only the crown prince can stand on
our side, the Qing will follow our will.

402
00:48:08,642 --> 00:48:09,642
Oh, my son.

403
00:48:09,643 --> 00:48:11,641
Oh, my son.

404
00:48:11,642 --> 00:48:19,642
Good job.

405
00:48:40,058 --> 00:48:43,458
The Crown Prince has
collapsed and is unconscious.

406
00:50:17,018 --> 00:50:18,417
Myungsoo! Myungsoo!

407
00:50:18,418 --> 00:50:25,254
Thumbs up if you like this video!
Hit the subscribe if you want more!

408
00:52:19,578 --> 00:52:25,078
Sir, do you need more Myeongjucheon?

409
00:53:00,538 --> 00:53:01,538
Good.

410
00:53:01,539 --> 00:53:04,793
You have a high fever.

411
00:53:04,794 --> 00:53:11,494
You can rest assured now.

412
00:53:26,922 --> 00:53:31,046
You've had a hard time.

413
00:53:39,226 --> 00:53:40,505
You've had a hard time.

414
00:53:40,506 --> 00:53:44,614
Go to the police station
and close your eyes.

415
00:55:37,946 --> 00:55:39,946
Did something happen between them?

416
00:56:51,834 --> 00:56:52,834
What's going on?

417
00:56:55,374 --> 00:56:56,374
Someone...

418
00:56:56,874 --> 00:56:59,174
ran away over that window

419
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,649
What is it?

420
00:57:36,650 --> 00:57:38,649
What's going on?

421
00:57:38,650 --> 00:57:40,649
It's a robbery!

422
00:57:40,650 --> 00:57:42,649
Hurry up and get in!

423
00:57:42,650 --> 00:57:44,650
What is it?

424
00:58:21,882 --> 00:58:22,882
Sergeant Jang!

425
00:58:23,882 --> 00:58:24,882
Sergeant Jang!

426
00:58:25,882 --> 00:58:30,033
What happened?

427
00:58:30,034 --> 00:58:31,034
Sergeant Jang!

428
00:58:37,274 --> 00:58:39,633
I'll see it with my own eyes.

429
00:58:39,634 --> 00:58:40,873
Get out of my way!

430
00:58:40,874 --> 00:58:44,033
What a ridiculous thing to do.

431
00:58:44,034 --> 00:58:47,942
Can't you get out of the way right now?

432
00:58:55,450 --> 00:58:56,450
Move!

433
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,450
It's an order.

434
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,449
No one is allowed to enter.

435
00:58:59,450 --> 00:59:01,450
What a scoundrel!

436
00:59:50,362 --> 00:59:53,642
No, no, no.

437
00:59:57,402 --> 01:00:01,001
He had a symptom of scabies, so
he was taken to Myeongju Village,

438
01:00:01,002 --> 01:00:03,701
and he was burned to death.

439
01:00:03,702 --> 01:00:05,201
Scabies?

440
01:00:05,202 --> 01:00:08,001
Yes. Fortunately, he's stable.

441
01:00:08,002 --> 01:00:11,502
I and the priest saw the
Crown Prince sleeping,

442
01:00:21,850 --> 01:00:23,850
Is what you say true?

443
01:00:29,818 --> 01:00:31,098
Yes, sir.

444
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,129
It's the death-wish in my will.

445
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:54,129
The symptoms of the King's death are not
the same as when he wrote the death-wish.

446
01:00:54,130 --> 01:01:02,130
Someone wrote this death-wish
and poisoned the crown prince.

447
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:08,806
I saw someone running away.

448
01:01:10,266 --> 01:01:12,578
Who did you see?

449
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:15,538
Save what you saw.

450
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:20,178
I was worried about the crown prince,
so I went back to the Haesikyeong.

451
01:01:20,878 --> 01:01:26,578
I saw someone running away
through the window of his palace.

452
01:01:26,718 --> 01:01:30,018
He ran away and hurt the Gyeongcheob.

453
01:01:31,438 --> 01:01:32,998
It's true.

454
01:01:33,878 --> 01:01:35,757
There was blood on the Gyeongcheob.

455
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:38,638
Does that mean he
poisoned the crown prince?

456
01:01:38,798 --> 01:01:45,518
Judging by the situation, the one who ran
away with the wound seems to be the poisoner.

457
01:01:46,798 --> 01:01:53,810
Your Highness, please inform
the government about this.

458
01:01:55,190 --> 01:02:01,998
Did you forget your promise to the government that
the crown prince will inherit the next position?

459
01:02:02,278 --> 01:02:05,978
If you don't inform the government
about the death of the king, the

460
01:03:14,490 --> 01:03:15,490
Wake up.

461
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:16,490
Wake up.

462
01:03:16,491 --> 01:03:19,489
We need to find the wounded.

463
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:20,490
Search the area.

464
01:03:50,266 --> 01:03:51,945
What happened?

465
01:03:51,946 --> 01:03:54,065
The world

466
01:03:54,066 --> 01:03:57,685
It's said to have been poisoned.

467
01:03:57,686 --> 01:04:02,345
But you're trying to cure that.

468
01:04:02,346 --> 01:04:04,545
What are you doing?

469
01:04:04,546 --> 01:04:07,805
Whose order is it?

470
01:04:07,806 --> 01:04:09,806
I'm going to kill you right now!

471
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:18,730
How can I believe this?

472
01:05:19,730 --> 01:05:20,230
Your Majesty.

473
01:05:20,231 --> 01:05:23,729
That you poisoned the crown prince of
Yeongi, who cherishes our Wonson so much.

474
01:05:23,730 --> 01:05:25,926
Your Majesty.

475
01:05:38,106 --> 01:05:39,506
Is there no one there?

476
01:05:40,766 --> 01:05:43,246
I gave poison to the princess
and the crown prince.

477
01:05:43,546 --> 01:05:45,726
There must be poison on
the tip of the needle.

478
01:05:47,346 --> 01:05:51,054
It's a wound I got when I went back to
the palace to save the crown prince.

479
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:51,714
Are you saying you gave up the small

480
01:05:51,715 --> 01:05:54,034
guard?

481
01:05:54,334 --> 01:05:57,014
I can see a little in the dark.

482
01:05:58,534 --> 01:06:02,190
After trying to study with these eyes, the

483
01:06:03,850 --> 01:06:05,173
crown prince

484
01:06:05,174 --> 01:06:09,350
gave it to me.

485
01:06:18,298 --> 01:06:21,738
Have you seen the magnifying
glass that the government brought?

486
01:06:29,146 --> 01:06:33,497
You finally found my master.

487
01:06:33,498 --> 01:06:38,817
You knew I could see a little
bit, but you kept it a secret.

488
01:06:38,818 --> 01:06:43,526
Why would I kill such a benefactor alone?

489
01:06:55,034 --> 01:06:57,034
Lee Young-ik poisoned
the crown prince's son?

490
01:07:01,002 --> 01:07:02,002
Yes, your highness.

491
01:07:03,822 --> 01:07:06,422
I will meet the king with this letter.

492
01:07:07,822 --> 01:07:09,822
If you need it, I will call you.

493
01:07:10,922 --> 01:07:12,922
Don't get caught until then and hide well.

494
01:07:33,178 --> 01:07:37,177
There are still a hundred people
who haven't been identified.

495
01:07:37,178 --> 01:07:39,577
We're looking for them one by one.

496
01:07:39,578 --> 01:07:40,578
Hurry.

497
01:07:56,282 --> 01:07:57,282
Hey.

498
01:07:58,262 --> 01:08:02,398
I'm from the Navy.

499
01:08:02,738 --> 01:08:04,117
I got tested.

500
01:08:04,118 --> 01:08:08,774
What's your name?

501
01:08:13,050 --> 01:08:14,650
I asked what your name was.

502
01:08:27,994 --> 01:08:29,994
What are you doing here?

503
01:08:30,994 --> 01:08:35,049
His Majesty has a paralysis symptom.

504
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,050
Hurry up and go.

505
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,050
What day is it?

506
01:08:37,051 --> 01:08:39,049
It's the time for the examination.

507
01:08:39,050 --> 01:08:42,049
Didn't you hear that His
Majesty has a paralysis symptom?

508
01:08:42,050 --> 01:08:43,050
Yes.

509
01:08:46,786 --> 01:08:50,786
I will be careful and careful.

510
01:08:51,786 --> 01:08:52,786
Yes, Your Majesty.

511
01:08:55,018 --> 01:08:58,017
This is abalone soup sent
from Kang Bin's mother's home.

512
01:08:58,018 --> 01:09:03,017
Your Majesty, you should keep your temperature
as much as possible at times like this.

513
01:09:03,018 --> 01:09:06,017
It's a paralysis because
of the weak energy.

514
01:09:06,018 --> 01:09:11,017
Do you want to go to the throat?

515
01:09:11,018 --> 01:09:12,018
I didn't mean that.

516
01:09:12,019 --> 01:09:15,018
I'm going to reduce the alcohol from today.

517
01:09:16,018 --> 01:09:19,018
I will write the crown
prince's questions myself.

518
01:09:20,018 --> 01:09:22,017
Tell the doctor that.

519
01:09:22,018 --> 01:09:23,018
Yes.

520
01:09:23,019 --> 01:09:30,362
You're drooling well
without even seeing it.

521
01:09:31,362 --> 01:09:32,362
Can you see it?

522
01:09:34,362 --> 01:09:36,362
You should drool from now on.

523
01:09:38,362 --> 01:09:40,362
I'm sorry, Your Majesty.

524
01:09:43,418 --> 01:09:46,417
Please take the crown prince's words.

525
01:09:46,418 --> 01:09:54,418
Yes.

526
01:10:15,962 --> 01:10:17,462
Are you okay?

527
01:10:18,262 --> 01:10:21,222
You have to wake up at times like this.

528
01:10:21,582 --> 01:10:23,642
You have to think about the original.

529
01:10:25,242 --> 01:10:28,230
What's this?

530
01:10:28,890 --> 01:10:31,090
This is the letter the witness gave me.

531
01:10:55,034 --> 01:10:56,594
Witness?

532
01:10:57,274 --> 01:10:58,813
What do you mean?

533
01:10:58,814 --> 01:11:05,830
The person who saw Lee Young-ik
is not a reader, but a witness.

534
01:11:12,026 --> 01:11:16,525
Kang Bin, what are you talking about?

535
01:11:16,526 --> 01:11:21,885
Actually, this guy is the one
who poisoned the crown prince.

536
01:11:21,886 --> 01:11:25,525
He framed the witness.

537
01:11:25,526 --> 01:11:27,165
It's unfair.

538
01:11:27,166 --> 01:11:28,066
It's a treason.

539
01:11:28,067 --> 01:11:33,254
Wasn't this poison in that kid's head mine?

540
01:11:59,162 --> 01:12:00,542
What are you doing?

541
01:12:13,050 --> 01:12:14,050
Yes.

542
01:12:14,970 --> 01:12:17,450
Who's the witness.

543
01:12:19,010 --> 01:12:21,338
Bring her here.

544
01:12:21,718 --> 01:12:22,698
The witness is.

545
01:12:22,699 --> 01:12:24,637
Mr. Oh Yeol-hee is not guilty.

546
01:12:24,638 --> 01:12:28,966
Oh Yeol-hee was with me.

547
01:13:20,410 --> 01:13:21,410
What?

548
01:14:34,874 --> 01:14:36,074
You do it.

549
01:14:51,066 --> 01:14:52,066
Okay.

550
01:15:01,146 --> 01:15:03,145
What's going on?

551
01:15:03,146 --> 01:15:04,146
Look at this.

552
01:15:04,147 --> 01:15:06,145
How dare you poison Seonhwa's son?

553
01:15:06,146 --> 01:15:07,146
What are you?

554
01:15:07,147 --> 01:15:09,146
Get him out of here right now!

555
01:15:11,146 --> 01:15:13,145
Look at this.

556
01:15:13,146 --> 01:15:18,145
This evil woman is trying
to poison her own son.

557
01:15:18,146 --> 01:15:19,146
I'll get you punished.

558
01:15:19,146 --> 01:15:20,146
How can you do that to your son?

559
01:15:20,147 --> 01:15:22,145
I'll get you punished.

560
01:15:22,146 --> 01:15:24,146
How can you do that to your son?

561
01:15:25,146 --> 01:15:27,145
How can you do that?

562
01:15:27,146 --> 01:15:29,145
I'll get you punished.

563
01:15:29,146 --> 01:15:32,217
We need to inform the court of
the death of the Crown Prince.

564
01:15:32,218 --> 01:15:36,217
Can you get rid of Gangbin's accusation
just because you're informing the court?

565
01:15:36,218 --> 01:15:38,217
We need to find out who did it.

566
01:15:38,218 --> 01:15:40,217
Who did it?

567
01:15:40,218 --> 01:15:42,218
It's Cho Young-cho.

568
01:15:43,218 --> 01:15:47,218
We need to get rid of Gangbin's
accusation and catch Cho Young-cho.

569
01:15:48,218 --> 01:15:52,730
We need to have a witness.

570
01:15:53,730 --> 01:15:55,729
A witness.

571
01:15:55,730 --> 01:15:58,185
A witness?

572
01:15:58,186 --> 01:16:00,185
A witness?

573
01:16:00,186 --> 01:16:02,185
You said you could do it.

574
01:16:02,186 --> 01:16:04,185
That's why you even gathered
the eyes of a blind man.

575
01:16:04,186 --> 01:16:06,185
What are you doing?

576
01:16:06,186 --> 01:16:07,186
Be nice.

577
01:16:07,187 --> 01:16:10,185
How far did you see the witness?

578
01:16:10,186 --> 01:16:13,185
What if he speaks?

579
01:16:13,186 --> 01:16:14,186
Tell me.

580
01:16:14,187 --> 01:16:16,186
Tell me.

581
01:16:18,186 --> 01:16:19,186
I can hear you.

582
01:16:19,187 --> 01:16:23,569
If you talk like that, I can
hear you from the front door.

583
01:16:23,570 --> 01:16:26,570
I can hear you from the front door.

584
01:16:27,570 --> 01:16:30,570
Speak quietly.

585
01:16:34,994 --> 01:16:37,449
What are you doing?

586
01:16:37,450 --> 01:16:41,450
If people see you with
me, they'll doubt me.

587
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:45,449
If you have anything to say,
I'll tell you in the car.

588
01:16:45,450 --> 01:16:47,610
If you have anything to say,
I'll tell you in the car.

589
01:16:59,578 --> 01:17:07,578
But did you burn all the books I sent you?

590
01:17:13,110 --> 01:17:14,894
Yes, Your Highness.

591
01:17:15,394 --> 01:17:19,714
You're not going to collect them
and threaten me later, are you?

592
01:17:21,094 --> 01:17:23,209
How could I do that?

593
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:24,830
If this goes wrong, you'll be

594
01:17:25,370 --> 01:17:26,970
caught and

595
01:17:27,750 --> 01:17:30,370
your children will be

596
01:17:58,846 --> 01:18:00,845
Go find the Grand Prince.

597
01:18:00,846 --> 01:18:01,846
What?

598
01:18:02,846 --> 01:18:04,845
What do you mean?

599
01:18:04,846 --> 01:18:05,846
You're so ridiculous.

600
01:18:05,846 --> 01:18:06,846
Stand up.

601
01:18:07,846 --> 01:18:08,846
Come here.

602
01:18:11,846 --> 01:18:13,845
The doctor is here.

603
01:18:13,846 --> 01:18:21,190
Tell him that the doctor saw everything.

604
01:18:51,194 --> 01:18:55,249
Sir!

605
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:57,249
Sir!

606
01:18:57,250 --> 01:19:01,897
The king of the Seosan palace is in danger.

607
01:19:01,898 --> 01:19:02,898
Please save him!

608
01:19:02,899 --> 01:19:04,898
Is there anyone there?

609
01:19:05,898 --> 01:19:07,897
There is no one.

610
01:19:07,898 --> 01:19:10,897
Please save him.

611
01:19:10,898 --> 01:19:12,898
Please!

612
01:19:13,898 --> 01:19:15,897
Okay, okay.

613
01:19:15,898 --> 01:19:18,897
You go first. I'll follow you soon.

614
01:19:18,898 --> 01:19:21,898
You go first. I'll follow you soon.

615
01:19:43,002 --> 01:19:46,193
You...

616
01:19:46,194 --> 01:19:48,194
My Lord...

617
01:19:50,194 --> 01:19:54,194
You were the one who
killed the Crown Prince!

618
01:19:55,194 --> 01:19:58,194
The King of Joseon, because of you!

619
01:19:59,194 --> 01:20:03,361
You saw everything and lied to me!

620
01:20:03,362 --> 01:20:08,070
What's there?

621
01:20:11,002 --> 01:20:12,402
Did you see it all?

622
01:20:13,602 --> 01:20:15,402
I heard it so clearly.

623
01:20:16,202 --> 01:20:17,901
What did you see?

624
01:20:17,902 --> 01:20:24,358
What did you see?

625
01:20:29,146 --> 01:20:33,646
Lee Hyung Ik poisoned the crown prince.

626
01:20:35,146 --> 01:20:39,878
The one who ordered the
poisoning is the crown prince.

627
01:20:40,878 --> 01:20:41,878
It's a lie!

628
01:20:42,878 --> 01:20:45,378
I should ask Grandfather right now.

629
01:20:45,878 --> 01:20:46,378
No, you can't.

630
01:20:46,378 --> 01:20:47,378
It's a lie, Your Majesty.

631
01:20:47,379 --> 01:20:49,378
Even the Empress Dowager is in danger.

632
01:20:50,378 --> 01:20:52,378
Grandfather killed my father!

633
01:20:56,922 --> 01:20:57,922
That can't be true.

634
01:20:57,923 --> 01:21:00,825
Your Majesty, if you go to
the crown prince like this,

635
01:21:00,826 --> 01:21:03,825
both the Empress Dowager
and the Empress will die.

636
01:21:03,826 --> 01:21:04,826
Grandfather!

637
01:21:04,827 --> 01:21:07,825
What the crown prince said is all a lie.

638
01:21:07,826 --> 01:21:08,826
Grandfather!

639
01:21:08,826 --> 01:21:09,826
Grandfather!

640
01:21:09,826 --> 01:21:10,826
Grandfather!

641
01:21:10,827 --> 01:21:14,826
I was trapped in a corner
when I found out about this.

642
01:21:22,010 --> 01:21:23,450
You saw everything.

643
01:21:25,210 --> 01:21:27,190
Why didn't you tell me?

644
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:30,774
Let's go.

645
01:21:31,414 --> 01:21:34,081
Let's go.

646
01:21:34,082 --> 01:21:39,142
I didn't tell you what you saw,
so my mom and dad are in jail.

647
01:21:39,622 --> 01:21:41,602
It's all because of me.

648
01:21:48,114 --> 01:21:50,778
There's a sick brother.

649
01:21:52,318 --> 01:21:54,805
If I tell you what I saw,

650
01:21:54,806 --> 01:21:57,986
my brother will die.

651
01:21:58,166 --> 01:22:04,794
You have to pretend you didn't see
anything miserable like us to live.

652
01:22:05,974 --> 01:22:10,354
I closed my eyes and came
all the way here, ma'am.

653
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:16,034
My dad, who I met after
10 years, is also in jail.

654
01:22:17,514 --> 01:22:20,685
My mom and dad are also in jail.

655
01:22:20,686 --> 01:22:24,510
Now I have no one.

656
01:22:29,486 --> 01:22:32,946
I've never seen my mother's face before.

657
01:22:34,526 --> 01:22:37,066
Didn't you say that, too?

658
01:22:52,282 --> 01:22:58,173
It's what the king of
this country abandoned.

659
01:22:58,174 --> 01:23:04,838
What do you want me to do?

660
01:23:35,226 --> 01:23:38,306
What should I do now?

661
01:23:40,046 --> 01:23:41,914
The king is the culprit, so I can't

662
01:23:42,914 --> 01:23:44,754
take the king.

663
01:23:46,234 --> 01:23:48,114
Wait a minute.

664
01:23:48,874 --> 01:23:50,409
If it's you,

665
01:23:50,410 --> 01:23:54,570
Who would believe that you saw it?

666
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:58,730
There's no winner.

667
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:02,129
But you're going to survive.

668
01:24:02,130 --> 01:24:08,169
Is there anywhere to hide?

669
01:24:08,170 --> 01:24:16,170
You're going to take the throne.

670
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:31,825
I'm sure he gave and received something.

671
01:24:31,826 --> 01:24:31,906
Wait a minute.

672
01:24:31,907 --> 01:24:36,838
I think I saw something.

673
01:24:50,458 --> 01:24:57,017
My father said that my mother
was poisoned by the spirit.

674
01:24:57,018 --> 01:25:00,657
That So-kyung definitely said that.

675
01:25:00,658 --> 01:25:04,166
So-kyung.

676
01:25:08,858 --> 01:25:11,457
This is the secret document that
the Chief sent to Lee Young-ik.

677
01:25:11,458 --> 01:25:19,014
This is not the Chief's handwriting.

678
01:25:25,114 --> 01:25:26,114
No, it's not.

679
01:25:26,374 --> 01:25:28,654
It's the handwriting of Grandmother.

680
01:25:29,174 --> 01:25:30,514
Grandmother.

681
01:25:31,974 --> 01:25:37,438
Why can't I write like this?

682
01:25:39,098 --> 01:25:41,450
Try it.

683
01:25:41,770 --> 01:25:44,130
Isn't it so bad down there?

684
01:25:45,050 --> 01:25:48,410
Hey, didn't you write
it with your left hand?

685
01:25:51,298 --> 01:25:53,818
It's the handwriting I
wrote with my left hand.

686
01:25:54,038 --> 01:25:55,757
I definitely saw it.

687
01:25:55,758 --> 01:26:00,078
This can't be a witness.

688
01:26:00,818 --> 01:26:06,157
Isn't this letter written
by Grandmother a witness?

689
01:26:06,158 --> 01:26:11,997
Isn't there no way to prove that
this handwriting is Joo-sung's?

690
01:26:11,998 --> 01:26:19,998
If Joo-sung has a handwriting written with his
left hand in front of people, he won't know.

691
01:26:29,818 --> 01:26:34,774
I can paralyze the right hand of the Lord.

692
01:26:37,466 --> 01:26:41,966
Do you know what that means?

693
01:26:42,466 --> 01:26:45,466
Guana is not a disease that can be
easily cured with a single stroke.

694
01:26:45,966 --> 01:26:47,966
The paralysis symptoms
will have increased by now.

695
01:26:48,466 --> 01:26:51,466
I can paralyze the right hand
of the enemy I'm attacking.

696
01:26:52,466 --> 01:26:54,466
Whatever excuse you give,

697
01:26:54,966 --> 01:26:57,965
please make the Lord
write with his left hand.

698
01:26:57,966 --> 01:27:05,874
I'm going to have to gather my
own soldiers and make a truce.

699
01:27:06,874 --> 01:27:10,873
I'm just a messenger.

700
01:27:10,874 --> 01:27:18,874
Let's trust Sogyeong and
replace the king of Joseon.

701
01:27:31,994 --> 01:27:34,793
Why did you change your mind?

702
01:27:34,794 --> 01:27:39,430
It's what a suicide is.

703
01:27:48,858 --> 01:27:50,857
What are the doctors doing at this hour?

704
01:27:50,858 --> 01:27:53,857
He needs to be put on a IV drip.

705
01:27:53,858 --> 01:27:55,857
You didn't say that.

706
01:27:55,858 --> 01:27:59,858
What would you do if I told you to
send him to the hospital for a IV drip?

707
01:28:00,858 --> 01:28:02,993
Now?

708
01:28:02,994 --> 01:28:10,598
If you don't get it right now, you'll
get paralysis all over your body.

709
01:28:38,330 --> 01:28:41,829
Your Highness, I'm here to
ask you to open the gate.

710
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:45,702
Open the gate.

711
01:29:27,894 --> 01:29:29,894
What's wrong with my hand?

712
01:29:30,994 --> 01:29:33,194
I can't get my hand to rest.

713
01:29:34,294 --> 01:29:37,894
It's a natural symptom that occurs
during the treatment of the wind.

714
01:29:39,394 --> 01:29:40,693
As time passes, it will slowly...

715
01:29:40,694 --> 01:29:41,994
I can't do this.

716
01:29:42,694 --> 01:29:43,694
Take this out.

717
01:29:45,294 --> 01:29:47,694
Your Majesty, if you take this out now,

718
01:29:47,794 --> 01:29:49,493
paralysis will spread all over your body.

719
01:29:49,494 --> 01:29:50,494
Take it out!

720
01:29:53,590 --> 01:29:54,789
If you take this out now,

721
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:57,670
you may not be able to use your arms
and legs for the rest of your life.

722
01:29:57,890 --> 01:29:58,890
Your Majesty,

723
01:29:58,891 --> 01:30:01,390
it's time for the sun to rise soon.

724
01:30:02,390 --> 01:30:03,889
Paralysis of the right hand

725
01:30:03,890 --> 01:30:07,889
is a natural reaction that occurs
during the process of the disease.

726
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:08,890
Your Majesty,

727
01:30:08,891 --> 01:30:11,389
you have to perform the first
ritual before the sun rises.

728
01:30:11,390 --> 01:30:12,390
I got it. I got it.

729
01:30:12,391 --> 01:30:20,391
I have to take this out...

730
01:30:37,786 --> 01:30:39,385
I came to tell you about the transfer.

731
01:30:39,386 --> 01:30:41,086
He's being interrogated.

732
01:30:41,386 --> 01:30:42,386
Interrogated?

733
01:30:42,387 --> 01:30:44,386
What are you doing?

734
01:31:08,058 --> 01:31:12,458
Who told you to drool without permission?

735
01:31:13,458 --> 01:31:14,698
What?

736
01:31:15,618 --> 01:31:16,878
I just got a

737
01:31:17,758 --> 01:31:21,017
letter saying to drool.

738
01:31:21,018 --> 01:31:22,538
Send a letter.

739
01:31:22,818 --> 01:31:24,098
Who is it?

740
01:31:24,658 --> 01:31:27,098
Didn't you say you sent it?

741
01:31:28,278 --> 01:31:29,478
That guy is the

742
01:31:29,958 --> 01:31:31,778
poisoner who killed

743
01:32:18,042 --> 01:32:20,041
What's your name?

744
01:32:20,042 --> 01:32:26,065
I'm Kyungsoo.

745
01:32:26,066 --> 01:32:29,577
Kyungsoo.

746
01:32:29,578 --> 01:32:33,281
Just once.

747
01:32:33,282 --> 01:32:37,830
I'll ask you one more time.

748
01:33:48,474 --> 01:33:49,474
Let's go.

749
01:34:01,198 --> 01:34:03,198
This way!

750
01:34:45,178 --> 01:34:47,178
What are you talking about?

751
01:35:13,402 --> 01:35:17,602
500 soldiers who are on the hunt at
Hongpansae in Dosong Market have gathered.

752
01:35:19,902 --> 01:35:21,633
What happened to the antidote?

753
01:35:21,634 --> 01:35:23,133
We found out from the chief.

754
01:35:23,134 --> 01:35:26,333
But fortunately, the soldier
ran away with the antidote.

755
01:35:26,334 --> 01:35:27,334
Ran away?

756
01:35:27,834 --> 01:35:28,834
To where?

757
01:35:28,835 --> 01:35:30,033
I don't know.

758
01:35:30,034 --> 01:35:32,733
We're supposed to meet at the main
battlefield, so let's go there first.

759
01:35:32,734 --> 01:35:33,734
No.

760
01:35:33,735 --> 01:35:37,033
We might lose our lives if
we trust the lieutenant.

761
01:35:37,034 --> 01:35:41,638
We have to get rid of
the soldiers right now.

762
01:36:20,150 --> 01:36:22,150
This way!

763
01:36:50,650 --> 01:36:52,650
What's going on?

764
01:37:16,122 --> 01:37:17,921
It's just a dog's nest.

765
01:37:17,922 --> 01:37:20,321
Where would Chief go?

766
01:37:20,322 --> 01:37:24,166
We'll find out.

767
01:37:28,698 --> 01:37:31,257
Go to Byulgam who's keeping the rumor

768
01:37:31,258 --> 01:37:35,258
If I say I sent it, I'll let you go.

769
01:38:01,018 --> 01:38:02,717
What's going on?

770
01:38:02,718 --> 01:38:04,917
I know. It's a mess.

771
01:38:04,918 --> 01:38:06,917
The Crown Prince is dead.

772
01:38:06,918 --> 01:38:08,257
I'm so scared.

773
01:38:08,258 --> 01:38:09,857
Shut up.

774
01:38:09,858 --> 01:38:12,357
I heard the Queen Mother is sick too.

775
01:38:12,358 --> 01:38:18,278
That's why Lee Yeong-ui
was called urgently.

776
01:38:44,986 --> 01:38:46,986
You son of a bitch!

777
01:39:02,618 --> 01:39:09,694
I'm going to kill you.

778
01:40:38,330 --> 01:40:39,330
Sir!

779
01:40:39,330 --> 01:40:40,330
Sir!

780
01:40:50,042 --> 01:40:51,042
Your Majesty.

781
01:40:51,922 --> 01:40:54,074
Your Majesty.

782
01:40:54,414 --> 01:40:56,414
I heard you can't see.

783
01:40:57,534 --> 01:41:00,394
You must have run away
from home, you bastard.

784
01:41:01,674 --> 01:41:04,854
I've never seen you,
I've never heard of you.

785
01:41:05,514 --> 01:41:08,054
I'm just trying to help you.

786
01:41:09,994 --> 01:41:13,033
Why are you getting involved in this?

787
01:41:13,034 --> 01:41:19,598
Give me the memorial.

788
01:41:24,850 --> 01:41:27,810
Who told you to do this?

789
01:41:29,030 --> 01:41:31,010
Did Choi Dae-gang tell you to do this?

790
01:41:31,290 --> 01:41:33,810
Kill me and move the memorial?

791
01:41:35,150 --> 01:41:39,750
Or Kang Bin.

792
01:41:40,770 --> 01:41:45,413
She tried to kill me and take
my place by kidnapping my son.

793
01:41:45,414 --> 01:41:48,694
Now you're going to put
this guy in my place?

794
01:41:50,014 --> 01:41:52,394
What did you say?

795
01:41:52,754 --> 01:41:55,814
You said you'd give me
a position of loyalty.

796
01:41:58,614 --> 01:42:02,313
Tell me, who told you to do this.

797
01:42:02,314 --> 01:42:07,334
Who told you to kill me.

798
01:42:17,946 --> 01:42:20,545
Did you come all the way here to find me?

799
01:42:20,546 --> 01:42:23,946
Or did you come all the way
here to find a place to hide?

800
01:42:26,186 --> 01:42:31,726
You have a good face.

801
01:42:32,266 --> 01:42:36,966
I can't tell what you're thinking.

802
01:42:37,266 --> 01:42:41,265
You don't look so good.

803
01:42:41,266 --> 01:42:49,266
If you come down from the throne
now, I'll spare your life.

804
01:42:50,218 --> 01:42:54,217
I'm your king.

805
01:42:54,218 --> 01:42:58,217
Where does the king go?

806
01:42:58,218 --> 01:43:02,217
Did you forget who sat on the throne?

807
01:43:02,218 --> 01:43:08,217
Yes, and now you're going to sleep
with the crown prince and kill me.

808
01:43:08,218 --> 01:43:16,218
There are martyrs outside
the city of Hanyang.

809
01:43:17,106 --> 01:43:23,105
Who will be the king who killed his son?

810
01:43:23,106 --> 01:43:25,105
Martyrs, come on.

811
01:43:25,106 --> 01:43:27,105
Give me.

812
01:43:27,106 --> 01:43:32,105
Then the Orangke guys will leave you alone.

813
01:43:32,106 --> 01:43:38,105
What if they kill us all and
build the king of Orangke?

814
01:43:38,106 --> 01:43:42,105
I'm not going to die.

815
01:43:42,106 --> 01:43:46,561
We need to join forces.

816
01:43:46,562 --> 01:43:50,561
How many more years will
I last if I endure it?

817
01:43:50,562 --> 01:43:54,561
If I die, I'm your crown prince anyway.

818
01:43:54,562 --> 01:44:02,561
How do I know when your heart will change?

819
01:44:02,562 --> 01:44:10,562
But do you believe in
who the crown prince is?

820
01:44:30,874 --> 01:44:37,222
That's what it looks like.

821
01:44:42,362 --> 01:44:45,722
What are you going to do with the enemy?

822
01:44:47,002 --> 01:44:49,857
If I let him go now,

823
01:44:49,858 --> 01:44:56,550
I'll set up a trap to
get revenge on my father.

824
01:45:08,346 --> 01:45:10,345
If it's a sunset, let it be a sunset.

825
01:45:10,346 --> 01:45:15,110
Close your eyes and live.

826
01:45:27,610 --> 01:45:29,610
There is no one to kill.

827
01:45:30,510 --> 01:45:35,581
The crown prince died of scabies.

828
01:45:35,582 --> 01:45:42,790
Take the prince and treat him.

829
01:46:06,426 --> 01:46:07,986
I brought it.

830
01:46:24,794 --> 01:46:28,234
The evidence is with you, sir.

831
01:46:29,674 --> 01:46:32,090
I saw it for sure.

832
01:46:33,490 --> 01:46:39,318
The chief is trying to kill that prince.

833
01:46:40,738 --> 01:46:43,094
I saw it.

834
01:46:44,394 --> 01:46:46,430
I saw it for sure.

835
01:46:47,890 --> 01:46:49,566
How.

836
01:46:50,266 --> 01:46:53,957
How can a father kill his son.

837
01:46:53,958 --> 01:47:01,958
What are you listening to.

838
01:47:04,914 --> 01:47:09,934
Kill the one who's pulling him right now.

839
01:47:12,434 --> 01:47:15,990
I saw it for sure.

840
01:47:17,450 --> 01:47:19,350
I saw it.

841
01:47:19,570 --> 01:47:21,310
Didn't you hear me?

842
01:47:22,330 --> 01:47:24,509
Didn't you hear me?

843
01:47:24,510 --> 01:47:27,309
Pull him right now and surrender.

844
01:47:27,310 --> 01:47:29,050
I saw it.

845
01:47:29,370 --> 01:47:31,529
Pull him right now.

846
01:47:31,530 --> 01:47:33,489
What are you doing.

847
01:47:33,490 --> 01:47:36,050
Pull him right now.

848
01:49:11,482 --> 01:49:12,482
What are you doing?

849
01:49:30,010 --> 01:49:32,009
You saw everything, didn't you?

850
01:49:32,010 --> 01:49:34,010
What did my ancestor do?

851
01:50:00,346 --> 01:50:02,346
You're a disgrace.

852
01:50:02,946 --> 01:50:04,546
You're a disgrace.

853
01:50:05,946 --> 01:50:07,345
Look at that.

854
01:50:07,346 --> 01:50:09,346
Look at that.

855
01:50:11,046 --> 01:50:12,846
You're a disgrace.

856
01:50:14,246 --> 01:50:16,146
You're a disgrace.

857
01:50:20,786 --> 01:50:22,786
Wait here while you eat this.

858
01:50:23,286 --> 01:50:24,286
Here.

859
01:50:27,686 --> 01:50:28,686
Did you hear?

860
01:50:28,687 --> 01:50:30,685
The king collapsed.

861
01:50:30,686 --> 01:50:31,686
The king?

862
01:50:31,686 --> 01:50:32,686
Yes.

863
01:50:32,687 --> 01:50:34,685
So he's looking for a name.

864
01:50:34,686 --> 01:50:35,686
Oh, really?

865
01:50:35,687 --> 01:50:37,185
Yes.

866
01:50:37,186 --> 01:50:39,186
A disgrace.

867
01:51:16,826 --> 01:51:22,345
I called a member of the committee who
said he would cause a death by drooling.

868
01:51:22,346 --> 01:51:30,346
I'll be on my way.

869
01:51:41,946 --> 01:51:47,886
Oh, you're here to kill me.

870
01:51:48,766 --> 01:51:52,986
Hey, hey, hey.

871
01:51:53,486 --> 01:51:56,565
Hey. I'm sorry.

872
01:51:56,566 --> 01:52:01,325
Who told you to kill me.

873
01:52:01,326 --> 01:52:09,326
It's starting again.

874
01:53:03,546 --> 01:53:06,346
What do you see?

874
01:53:07,305 --> 01:54:07,505
