00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,600
there is a winter coat here

00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,300
that's just right for you.

Sister Theresa,

169
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:21,500
do you know anything
about these shoes right here?

170
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,600
I'm not sure.

171
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,800
[Whispers]
It's a perfect fiit.

172
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,600
Well, the guy
who dropped them off

173
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:34,100
said they used to belong
to some famous basketball player

174
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,400
when he was a kid.

175
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:37,800
Um...which...
which basketball player?

176
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,300
Uh...

00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,000

Murph, Reg, come here, look.

181
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:55,000
Look at the shoes.

Was it MichaelJordan?

Go. Do your homework.

188
00:08:07,900 --> 00:08:10,800
It's gotta be! MichaelJordan
wore these sneakers, man.

Yeah. I said MichaelJordan.

Well, I want 'em!

Suppose Ox is right
and they're not MJ's.

209
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
They are MJ's sneakers.

00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,400
I know they are.

00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,600
Then we'll get 'em in the morning.

Not in the morning.
Not while Ox is around.

Besides, they'll get ruined in the rain.

Well, Calvin,

seems like a really great idea.

Whoa.

The tickets were there
just like Coach Wagner said.

228
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:32,600
I can't believe we're gonna see
a real NBA game.

Oh, me, neither.

I'm telling Bittleman.

Geoff Witcher:
The Knights have one more chance here

238
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,800
to chip away at this lead
before halftime.

239
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,700
They're not shooting well.

240
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,500
Open at the wing is Reynolds.

241
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,900
He puts it up...

242

Oh, no good.

Oh, man.

244
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:13,900
Reynolds misses another shot,

245
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,000
and that's the end of the fiirst half.

246
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,500
Minnesota Timberwolves
out in front of the Knights by 1 2,

247
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,700
and once again,

248
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,000
the Knights did not play
very good basketball

249
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,200
in the fiirst half.

250

we gotta get one of these.

331
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:53,600
OK, OK, Calvin.
Very good.

332
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,100
Now, you're gonna
have 60 seconds, OK?

333
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,200
Let's get the show
on the road!

334
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,100
All right, all right.
You ready, little man?

335
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,900
Man:Hey, kid, tie your shoe.

336
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,100
Thank you, sir.

337
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:06,100
We like our players to be loose,
not their laces.

338
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,700
[Whispers]
Make me like Mike.

339
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,600
OK...go!

340
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:22,900
Good luck to you, all right?
Here we go.

341
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,100
Whoo-hoo. Hoo-hoo.

342
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:25,300
Aw.

343
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,900
- You like that?
- I'm jealous.

344
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,900
- Whoo-hoo.
- Aw, OK.

345
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:30,400
Got that?

346
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,900
Very nice.

347
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,200
Calvin has just won himself
an L.A. Knights sweatshirt.

348
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,300
Computer: Chessmaster 2000.

349
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,000
Would you like to play a game?

350
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,000
And we begin.

351
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,100
Pawn to queen 4.

352
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,800
That was really nice.
That was really nice.

353
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:53,100
Really? Thanks.

354
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:57,000
Can't go that way.
Can't go that way.

355
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,100
I didn't know it was like that.

356
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,400
Yeah, you didn't know
it was like that?

357
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,400
Uh-huh, can't go that way, either.
Come on, now.

358
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,000
Tracy Reynolds.
Man, I play "D."

359
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,000
That's what I'm playing.

360
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,200
Oh.

361
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,100
Whoa.

362
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,300
Oh.

363
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,000
Whoo!

364
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,200
How did I do that?

365
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,000
Now, how did he do that?

366
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,900
He just won a signed basketball
with an impressive 30-footer.

367
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,100
That one was sweet, wasn't it?

368
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:26,000
Nobody said nothing about this kid
embarrassing me out here.

369
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:28,400
That's your last shot, little man.
Recess is over.

370
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:29,800
Bernard: One more shot,

371
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,300
and he wins $ 1,000.

372
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,900
Tracy Reynolds, baby.
You got what, 9 seconds?

373
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,800
Let's do it.

374
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:35,800
I'm really sorry...

375
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,500
It's all right, little man.

376
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:38,600
Come on, little man.
Come on.

377
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:41,400
Come on, what you got?

378
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,800
It's my gym, baby.

379
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,200
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

380
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
Back. OK.

381
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,400
Uh-huh.

382
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,300
[Total Silence]

383
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,500
Y...es.

Computer:Pawn takes Knight.

385
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:04,600
Hah!

[Silence]

387
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,800
All right, Calvin!

00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,200
Whoo!

389
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,100
[Raucous Cheering]

390
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,200
Yeah.

391
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,900
Go, Calvin!

392
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:58,600
I guess this would be a bad time
for me to ask for your autograph, huh?

393
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,800
Hi there! Oh.

394
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,800
Playing a little checkers I see, huh?

395
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,400
Computer:Error. Error.

396
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:10,800
I was about to win.

397
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,700
So, are you the man I see
about Calvin Cambridge?

398
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,500
OK, let me get this straight...

399
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:19,100
You guys want to
have Calvin play for the Knights?

400
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,300
Right.

401
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:21,700
Why?

402
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:24,200
I been coaching 3 5 years.

403
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,100
This is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard of.

404
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,000
Well, you didn't see him
play at halftime.

405
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,400
Hey, coach.

406
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,300
Hi...again.

407
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:35,400
Am I gonna be a Knight?

408
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,900
[Softly]
He's 4 1 l2 feet tall.

409
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,000
I know.

410
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,300
Can you imagine the press
we're gonna get?

411
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,500
Look, coach, I know attendance
is in the crapper, OK,

412
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,300
and I'm not averse to using
the word "gimmick."

413
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,800
This is about making money.

414
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,100
I see. And speaking of money...

415
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,500
Ah, yes, money.

416
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:03,400
Mr. Bittleman,
I'm prepared to make you an offer

417
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:08,300
of $5,000
for a one-day contract.

418
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:10,500
Ah...well.

419
00:20:11,500 --> 00:20:16,400
Uh, seeing that
I'm Calvin's guardian,

420
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,100
uh...

421
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,300
I do have to make certain
that nobody takes advantage of him.

422
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,400
You mean except for you?

423
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
Hey, I resent that.

424
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:29,400
Uh, Mr. Bittleman, uh, perhaps,
uh, perhaps, uh...

425
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:31,800
an extra 2,500 might help

426
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,900
ease your worries.

427
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,000
Deal.

428
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,600
Good.

429
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:40,500
I always knew that there was
something special about Calvin.

430
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,700
Wow, man, you're on the Knights.

431
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,400
I can't believe you're gonna
get to play in the NBA.

432
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,200
I still can't believe
what happened to me yesterday.

433
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,100
Whatever I wanted to do
with the rock, I could do.

434
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,400
Whatever I wanted to do
on the court, I could do.

435
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,300
And there he was...

436
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,300
Tracy Reynolds, NBA superstar...

437
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,500
and I outplayed him.

438
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,300
Yeah, man.
And you hit that "J." Fade-away.

439
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,700
Calvin: That was a swish.
That was a swish.

440
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,000
You alley-ooped yourself
off the backboard.

441
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,400
Reg: Yeah, that was hot.

442
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,400
But...how?

443
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,300
That's a good question.

444
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:19,000
I don't know.
All I know is that before I had these...

445
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,000
All: Sneakers.

446
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,600
I couldn't play like that
if my life depended on it.

447
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,100
Murph, hand me that ball.

448
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,800
Man...

449
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:40,100
you're like some
weird basketball Cinderella.

450
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,400
[Whispering]
Yeah, and the clock's
gonna strike midnight

451
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:43,700
if somebody fiinds out.

452
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:50,600
Wow, I wish I was going with you.

453
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,500
Me, too.

454
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,100
We'll be rooting for you.

455
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,500
- Come on, let's go.
-Yeah.

456
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,700
Hey, everybody.

457
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,800
Hey, Trace, you need
to get your notebook out

458
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:15,700
'cause the kid is back
to school you again.

459
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,000
Ha ha ha. Your mama.

460
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,600
[Laughter]

461
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,200
Hey, Tracy, look,
I'm sorry about the other day.

462
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:22,800
No, no, no.
It's all right, little man.

463
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:24,200
No need to be sorry, all right?
You got lucky.

464
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,400
It's all right.

465
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,400
Hey, I'm Joad.

466
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:29,800
Why don't you take
the locker next to mine?

467
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,000
Here's your uniform, Calvin.

468
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,100
Special ordered...
ofiicial shirt, shorts,

469
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:38,500
socks, and sneakers.

470
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,500
Uh, but I like my own sneakers.

471
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,500
Oh...ours aren't good enough
for the kid.

472
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,500
No, it's nothing like that.

473
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,300
It's just that
I play better in mine.

474
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:52,000
Play?
You just have to look good.

475
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:57,800
What do you mean?

476
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,300
Coach, may I please
ask you a question?

477
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,900
Sure.

478
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Coach, I have a lot of friends
here tonight, and, uh...

479
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:15,700
I was just wondering...
wondering, am I here to play,

480
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,900
or am I just here for show?

481
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:25,000
Calvin, I'm gonna
be straight with you.

482
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:29,100
You were hired tonight
just to increase attendance,

483
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,300
not to play.

484
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:31,400
Man.

485
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,800
But...I saw the tape

486
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,900
of that halftime show
you put on.

487
00:23:36,700 --> 00:23:38,800
You got some game.

488
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,800
I am honored
to have you on my team.

489
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,500
Thanks, coach.

490
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:47,400
You bet.

491
00:23:51,300 --> 00:23:52,400
Whoo.!

492
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:52,700
Whoo.!

493
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,600
Geoff: We've got a bigger
than usual crowd tonight,

494
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,100
and a lot of it is curiosity.

495
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,500
The Knights have a brand new player.

496
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,000
He's 4-foot, 8-inch Calvin Cambridge,

497
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:11,000
joining us straight from the playground
of the Chesterfield group home.

498
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,400
Reggie, your reaction.

499
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,100
Geoff, this is unprecedented.

500
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:17,200
I can't imagine what the Knights players
are thinking. We'll see what happens.

501
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,400
We're gonna fiind out shortly.

502
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,700
Both clubs are taking the court

503
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:22,300
as we get ready
for tonight's opening tip.

504
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,400
Go Knights!

505
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
What was that?!

506
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Admiral! Admiral!

507
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,000
The admiral just waved at me.

508
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,900
He just waved at me.
Admiral!

509
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,000
Hey...

510
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,400
Come on! Hey! Hey!

511
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,100
Geoff: Coach Wagner of the Knights
has seen enough.

512
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,600
He wants and gets a time-out.

513
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,600
Let's go. Let's go.
Good hustle, baby.

514
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:06,500
What?

515
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:12,400
Come on, guys.
It's not funny.

516
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:16,100
Now, offense, is there any play
that's gonna work for us tonight?

517
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,900
I have an idea.

518
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,600
Oh, man.

519
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,300
I've been watching,

520
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:21,800
and they're vulnerable
from the weak side,

521
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,300
especially to a pick set
away from the hoop.

522
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,500
Why don't we run
the give-and-give-and-go?

523
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:27,900
You mean
the give-and-go?

524
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:29,800
No, see,
they'll be expecting that.

525
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:32,000
Have Tracy feed the ball
to Henderson.

526
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,200
Henderson's gonna
feed the ball toJoad.

527
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,900
Joad's gonna pass it
back to Tracy.

528
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,500
As Henderson sets the pick,

529
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:39,100
Tracy's gonna take the shot.

530
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:43,300
I like it.

531
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,800
Oh, no. No.
I'm not gonna run some play

532
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,900
by some snotty-nosed kid, man.

533
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:48,100
Damn straight, coach.

534
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,800
Fine. Henderson, you're out.

535
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,200
Tracy, you take Henderson's slot.

536
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,100
Calvin, you take the shot.

537
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,100
What?

538
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:06,700
Have you lost your mind?

539
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,500
- You said I could play anybody I want.
- Yeah, well, I didn't mean him.

540
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:11,800
Am I the coach or not?

541
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,000
You are. For now.

542
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,200
Can you believe it, Reggie?

543
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,400
It looks like
the kid's gonna play.

544
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,400
A rousing welcome
for the man they came to see,

545
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,100
the little fella,
Calvin Cambridge,

546
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,200
into the game for the Knights.

547
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,000
Calvin! Run the play!

548
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,700
What's he doin'?

549
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,700
- Run the play.
- No.

550
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,800
Would you just run the play?

551
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,000
Time out! White!

552
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,600
Why'd you call time out?

553
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,500
Uh...I gotta pee.

554
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,800
He's gotta pee.

Calvin Cambridge is calling for

556

a bathroom break?

00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,500
I guess when you gotta go,
Reggie,you gotta go.

That can mean just one thing.

That little guy,

has taken care ofbusiness
in the locker room

He's done.

Ladies and gentlemen,
this kid's for real.

567

He can play some basketball.

Announcer:
This is the NBA on NBC.

584
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,300
The big story in the NBA:

585
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,900
Calvin Cambridge,
the 4-foot-8 dynamo,

586
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:35,800
has now signed
a lucrative contract

587
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,700
with the Knights.

588
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,900
And no wonder,
after he led them

589
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,800
to a come-from-behind win
over the Spurs with 27 points?

590
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,200
That kid was unbelievable.

591
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,300
Did I just see
the admiral saluting him

592
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,400
at the end of the game?

593
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:46,800
You know, Cambridge's
contract makes him

594
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:48,600
the youngest,
and the shortest person

595
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,300
ever to sign a deal
with the NBA.

596
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,700
He's lean, he's mean, he's 1 3.

597
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,100
Yeah, now all the kids
are gonna be saying,

598
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:55,200
"I wanna be like Calvin."

599
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,200
Well, I guarantee you one thing,

600
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,200
this orphan
will not be an orphan for long.

601
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:03,500
I can't believe you're going on the road
with the Knights.

602
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,200
Can I fiit in your suitcase?

603
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,600
Hey, what about me?

604
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:08,900
Bittleman.

605
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,500
Hey, Calvin, this is great.

606
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:16,100
Well, uh, I'm proud of you.

607
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:18,400
Listen, uh, when you're on the road,

608
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:20,700
uh, people might want to adopt you.

609
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,100
But you should realize it's, uh,

610
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,800
only because you're a celebrity now,

611
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,400
and, uh, they're just after your money.

612
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,900
Besides,your contract forbids it.

613
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,200
Wait a minute. Forbids it?

614
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,800
Oh, yeah.
Didn't I tell you?

615
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,500
Uh, I signed your contract
as your guardian,

616
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:46,500
so, um, as long as
you're playing for the Knights,

617
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,500
that can't change.

618
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,900
Hey, coach, check this out!

619
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,000

we could play Monopoly.

653
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,500
Oh, yeah, I noticed.

654
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:10,600
Have fun, Tracy.
[Laughs]

655
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,800
All right, look.

656
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,900
Coach says I gotta room with you,

657
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,600
so let me set down the rules
right now.

658
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,600
First of all,
I ain't your boy, OK?

659
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,700
I'm not gonna be playin'
Monopoly with you,

660
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,900
Game Cube, Rubik's Cube...

661
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,400
Anything with a cube,
I ain't playin'.

662
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,900
Third, you know, I'm not gonna
be tuckin' you in at night,

663
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,900
and I'm defiinitely
not gonna read you

664
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,700
the Three Little Bears,
you got that?

665
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,100
Whoa! Look at this!

666
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,800
Do we always
stay in places this fancy?

667
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,900
Mm-hmm.

668
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,800
OK.

669
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:55,900
All right, I'm goin' out.

670
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,800
Oh, um, w-would you
like some company?

671
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,900
No. No,
I wouldn't like company.

672
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:03,900
Well, what do I do?

673
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,800
Uh, well, um...

674
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:09,000
oh, call room service,
get some food.

675
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:12,100
But what's room service?

676
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,400
Right. Right. OK.
Here's what you do.

677
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:16,300
You pick up this phone, right?

678
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,400
Mm-hmm.

679
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:19,500
And you dial "6".
Tell them what you want

680
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,800
and they'll bring it
to the room...for free.

681
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:23,600
For free?

682
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,300
For free.
You got it. Eat up.

683
00:33:25,300 --> 00:33:27,800
No, you gotta be
messin' with me, right?

684
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:29,700
No, I'm not.
Try it yourself.

685
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,600
For free.

686
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,400
Hello?

687
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,200
Uh, yes.
Um, is this room service?

688
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:38,100
Yes, it is.

689
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,300
And will you really

690
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,700
bring me up
some food for free?

691
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,800
Well, sure.
Anything you like, sir.

692
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,600
You will?

693
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,600
OK, um, in that case,
I'll have a pepperoni pizza,

694
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,600
french fries, and cake,
ice cream, and lobster tails.

695
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,800
Lots oflobster, lots of seafood.

696
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:53,200
Chicken fiingers, french fries...

697
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,600
[Calvin Moaning]

698
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,100
Ah, man.

699
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,800
[Groans]

700
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,200
Um, you know what?
Let me...

701
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,700
I just want to clean up
just a little, OK?

702
00:34:08,700 --> 00:34:09,800
Well, that's OK.

703
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:10,900
No. No. No. I just
want to clean up this...

704
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,400
Hey, you're so beautiful,
I have to clean up for you.

705
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,400
No, it's all right.

706
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,900
OK, so I'll be right back.

707
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,300
Calvin, I need you...

708
00:34:17,300 --> 00:34:18,400
Calvin, what are you doing?

709
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,800
What are you making such a mess for?

710
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,000
You were right about room service.

711
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,200
OK, Calvin. Calvin.

712
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,900
Know what?
I need you to get lost.

713
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,900
OK? I don't care where you go,
just get lost.

714
00:34:29,900 --> 00:34:30,900
Joad wants to play NBA Street.

715
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:33,300
No, Calvin, not in there.
Calvin, no! Calvin!

716
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,700
Calvin! Calvin!

717
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,700
[Hushed]
Calvin! Calvin!

718
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:38,000
Hey.
[Chuckles]

719
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:38,900
Hey, you know what?

720
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:40,400
The maid forgot to come today

721
00:34:40,300 --> 00:34:41,500
and, you know,
maybe we could go to your place?

722
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,200
Is someone else in here?

723
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,000
Because I thought
I heard some voices.

724
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,300
Oh, there's...Really.
There's no one in there.

725
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:48,600
Oh, my God.

726
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:49,500
Oh, where'd he come from?

727
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:52,100
You're Calvin Cambridge,
aren't you?

728
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,600
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?

729
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:54,900
We're gonna get you
out of these clothes

730
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:55,900
and get you some air, OK?

731
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,800
Oh, brother. Here we go.

732

[Burps]

733
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:03,600
Oh! You are just
the sweetest thing!

734
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,700
[Giggles]
Isn't he just the sweetest thing?

735
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,700
[Mutters]

736
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,900
Tracy, you should have told me
Calvin was your roommate.

737
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,100
Yeah, well,
it must have slipped my mind.

738
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,700
See, me and Tracy are tight.

739
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:16,900
So that's why I call him T-time.

740
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,700
So cute.

741
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:22,900
So, what's your nickname for Calvin,
T-time?

742
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,500
I don't have one yet,

743
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,900
but, oh, so many of them
come to mind.

744
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,700
Is that better, baby?

745
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,800
Yeah, I think T-time needs some, too.

746
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:35,000
Oh! Ha ha!

747
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,300
$2,000 jacket.

748

Gettin' water on a $2,000 jacket.

749
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,200
Couldn't you just eat him up?

750
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,300
Sorry about taking your girl.

751
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,400
She's not my girl,
and you didn't take her.

752
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:48,800
I don't know what it is.
It's like some type of curse.

753
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,600
The girls just like me.

754
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,700
Can we go to sleep?

755
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,100
Well, aren't we gonna
say our prayers?

756
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,200
'Cause at the home
we always say our prayers.

757
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,300
We're not at the home.

758
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,600
Well, I can't go to sleep
until I say my prayers.

759
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,000
Then say your prayers.

760
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,300
All right.

761
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:07,900
Well, aren't you gonna
say 'em with me?

762
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,400
Bow your head.
Bow your head.

763
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,000
Both:
Now I lay me down to sleep,

764
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,200
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

765
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:22,700
If I should die before I wake,

766
00:36:22,700 --> 00:36:25,000
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
Amen.

Amen.

772
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,400
Anybody that you want to bless?

773
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,100
A girlfriend, or your parents, maybe?

774
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,900
No, my parents are gone.

775
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,200
Hey, um...

776
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:51,100
I'm sorry.

777
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,400
I guess that makes you
an orphan like me.

778
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:57,200
Yeah, I guess.

779
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,800
Why don't you get in bed?

780
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:03,400
All right.
Good night.

781
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,200
There's just one thing.

782
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,900
Can we sleep with the light on?

783
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,800
'Cause at the home

784
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
we always sleep with the light on.

785
00:37:11,900 --> 00:37:14,400
OK, we'll sleep with the light on.
Satisfiied?

786
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,100
I don't wanna hear
another sound tonight, OK?

787
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:18,300
Good night.

788

[Snoring Louder]

790
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,500
Oh, man.

791
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:40,000
What's the matter, Tracy?
Late night?

792
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,600
Yeah, real late night. Heh.

793
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,600
Ain't that right, Trace?

794
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,600
Really? How late?

795
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,200
See, there's this girl named Janet Kelly
came up to the room, fiine as can be.

796
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,100
She picked me and Tracy up.

797
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:54,300
We didn't come back to the room
about 1:00 in the morning.

798
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,900
He doesn't know better,

799
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:58,000
but you know the rule
about the ladies in the room,

800
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,000
and last time I checked,
curfew was midnight.

801
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,800
No, it was his snorin'
that kept me up all night.

802
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,800
Oh, you always got an excuse.

803
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:07,300
Look, if you think
helping him break curfew

804
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:08,700
is gonna get you
out ofbein'his mentor,

805
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,200
you're mistaken...

806
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:11,900
and if you miss curfew again,

807
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:14,300
I'm gonna have
to suspend you. Got it?

808
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:15,800
Yeah, I got it.

809
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,400
You know what, man?

810
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,500
You got to learn how to chill.

811
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:23,200
Tracy, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

812
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,100
Don't worry, man.

1131
00:52:35,300 --> 00:52:36,500
That's brave.

1132
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:40,100
Hmm.

1133
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,600
Right.

1134
00:52:41,500 --> 00:52:44,900
OK, OK. So since I'm brave
in gettin' on this plane,

1135
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:47,000
why don't you be brave...

1136
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:50,000
and turn off the light?

1137
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:53,300
[Sighs]

1138
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,900
I don't know.

1139
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:57,900
Hmm.

1140
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:07,700
[Sighs]

1141
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:15,000
Are you prepared for
that big test tomorrow?

1142
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,800
Yes, Sister Theresa.

1143
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,500
Reg, you have to help me, please.

1144
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:23,600
I'm not helping you
with your geometry.

1145
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:24,600
Why?

1146
00:53:24,700 --> 00:53:26,900
Because I don't understand it
any more than you do.

1147
00:53:26,900 --> 00:53:29,000
Welcome, everybody,
and follow me into the room.

1148
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,800
[Chattering]

1149
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,600
Who are all those people?

1150
00:53:33,500 --> 00:53:35,900
Parents, here to see you.

1151
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:37,900
What's wrong, Murph?
I mean, that's a good thing, right?

1152
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,300
Good for you.

1153
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,000
It doesn't do us any good.

1154
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:45,200
Murph.

1155
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:48,800
Congratulations.
Go get adopted.

1156
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:51,000
What's wrong with him?

1157
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:51,900
What do you think?

1158
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,000
I don't know.

1159
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:55,200
Bittleman told me
that I couldn't get adopted.

1160
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,000
And you believe Bittleman?

1161
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:00,900
Coach Wagner On Phone:
His contract says nothing
about adoption.

1162
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,300
Look, why would you send
all of these people here?

1163
00:54:03,200 --> 00:54:04,500
Calvin deserves a home.

1164
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:06,500
You're only interested
in making money off him.

1165
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:09,000
Look, with all due respect,
Coach Wagner,

1166
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,300
child custody law is very complex.

1167
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:12,900
Mr. Bittleman.

1168
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,300
Coach Wagner:Just because you
signed his contract as his guardian...

1169
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:17,300
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.

1170
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,700
Coach Wagner:
Wait! I'm not through talkin'...

1171
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:20,100
Yes, what is it, Calvin?

1172
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,400
You lied to me.

1173
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,600
What are you talking about?

1174
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:24,200
You told me
no one can adopt me.

1175
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,100
I never said that.

1176
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,900
Look, Calvin,

1177
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:42,300
bear in mind I have cared for you

1178
00:54:42,200 --> 00:54:45,400
way before
you were rich or famous,

1179
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:47,000
and all of those people in there,

1180
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:48,700
the only reason
that they're interested in you

1181
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:50,100
is because you're famous.

1182
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:51,800
I'd like to see for myself.

1183
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:55,400
Well, that's fiine.

1184
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,700
I will, um...

1185
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:01,800
make arrangements
with the very best candidates.

1186
00:55:01,800 --> 00:55:04,000
What do you think about that,
my big man?

1187
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:05,600
We've been doing musical dinner theater
now over 6 years.

1188
00:55:05,600 --> 00:55:06,800
... In over 27 cities.
... Mm-hmm.

1189
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:14,400
No more hard-knock life
for you, Calvin.

1190
00:55:14,300 --> 00:55:19,100
#The sun'll come out tomorrow #

1191
00:55:18,900 --> 00:55:23,400
# Bet your bottom dollar
that tomorrow #

1192
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:25,600
#They'll be sun #

1193
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:27,700
We run a tight ship, Cambridge!

1194
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,200
Roll call 0600!

1195
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:30,200
I think you're gonna flip

1196
00:55:30,100 --> 00:55:32,800
for my sugar-free
seaweed rice cream.

1197
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,900
# I just stick out my chin #

1198
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,000
#And grin #

1199
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:37,200
All right, good buddy.

1200
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,700
Now Denise here
will home school you

1201
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:40,700
'cause we're on the road 2 4-7.

1202
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:41,900
#And I say #

1203
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:44,800
Ya, Ras Clap, ya have to
come back with me, ya seein'?

1204
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:47,200
#Tomorrow, tomorrow #

1205
00:55:47,100 --> 00:55:48,900
How tall are you, boy?!
How tall are you?!

1206
00:55:48,900 --> 00:55:50,500
You'll learn to hold your bladder.

1207
00:55:50,500 --> 00:55:52,600
#We love ya tomorrow #

1208
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:55,900
## You're only a day ##

1209
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:59,200
#Away #

1210
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:03,200
You see, Calvin?

1211
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:06,100
You're best off here...

1212
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:07,400
with me.

1213
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:16,200
Hey, yo, Trace.

1214
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,200
Tracy: Hello?

1215
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,600
It's me, Calvin.

1216
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:19,800
Calvin. Wait. You're here?

1217
00:56:19,700 --> 00:56:21,100
Yeah, I'm here,

1218
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,100
and it took me 4 busses
to get here, too.

1219
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:24,200
Uh, all right.

1220
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,800
Dang.
Man, this is where you live?

1221
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:41,900
Calvin, what are you doing here?

1222
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,900
Hey, I just can't wait
to see the inside.

1223
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,000
Calvin.

1224
00:56:45,100 --> 00:56:46,800
Calvin, wait. Calvin.

1225
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:49,200
Come on, Calvin.
Tell me why you're here.

1226
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:52,000
Aw, this is tight.

1227
00:56:51,900 --> 00:56:53,500
Look at all the stuff you got, man.

1228
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,500
Yeah. Yeah, it's tight.

1229
00:56:55,400 --> 00:56:57,300
So come on, man, tell me what's up.
Why you here?

1230
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,300
I wanna check your place out.

1231
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:04,600
You know,just look at your crib
and everything.

1232
00:57:04,500 --> 00:57:06,500
What do you call this game?

1233
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:09,000
I have no idea.
It came with the house.

1234
00:57:08,900 --> 00:57:10,300
Oh, man.

1235
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,000
So you're not gonna tell me
why you're here?

1236
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,600
We need one of these
at the orphanage.

1237
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,700
OK, OK. So I take it
you don't wanna tell me

1238
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:19,200
what's goin' on with you.
I understand.

1239
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:20,100
It's your prerogative.
That's cool.

1240
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,300
No, I mean, nothin's goin' on.

1241
00:57:22,300 --> 00:57:23,200
I mean, everything's all right.

1242
00:57:23,200 --> 00:57:24,200
Everything's goin' real well.

1243
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:25,200
Everything's perfect.

1244
00:57:25,300 --> 00:57:26,900
Uh, everything's, uh,

1245
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:28,100
you know, uh...

1246
00:57:30,700 --> 00:57:32,000
All right, man.

1247
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:34,700
Everything's goin' real
terrible right about now.

1248
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:36,400
My best friend Murph,
he's mad at me.

1249
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,500
Bittleman lied to me.

1250
00:57:37,500 --> 00:57:40,200
He set up the worst parents
in orphan history

1251
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,900
to come meet with me.

1252
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:43,200
And then, on top of that,

1253
00:57:43,300 --> 00:57:46,400
I have a geometry test tomorrow,
and I hate geometry.

1254
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:48,300
Mmm.
All right, well, listen,

1255
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,600
I'm sure the right parents
are gonna show up for you, OK?

1256
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:53,000
It's just a question of time,
so you gotta have a little faith.

1257
00:57:52,900 --> 00:57:54,900
All right?
But in the meantime...

1258
00:57:58,400 --> 00:57:59,500
call your boy Murph.

1259
00:57:59,600 --> 00:58:01,700
- Right now?
- Right now, yes.

1260
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:02,600
Good friends are hard to come by,

1261
00:58:02,700 --> 00:58:04,200
so you gotta keep things
straight with 'em.

1262
00:58:04,200 --> 00:58:06,100
You have your geometry work with you?

1263
00:58:06,000 --> 00:58:07,400
Yeah.

1264
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,900
You know a little somethin'
about geometry?

1265
00:58:09,800 --> 00:58:11,800
[Chuckles]
Do I know about geometry?

1266
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,300
Ha ha ha!
Do I know about geometry?

1267
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:19,400
Take-Take your time on that call,

1268
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,200
and, um, meet me outside.

1269
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:25,100
I gotta...
I know geometry, but let me...

1270
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,000
OK, now, the key
to the whole geometry thing

1271
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,900
and gettin' the hang of these triangles
is to super-size them.

1272
00:58:35,800 --> 00:58:37,500
- Super-size?
- Super-size.

1273
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:38,600
You painted your house.

1274
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:40,400
All right, look. Tell me
what triangle this is right here.

1275
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:40,900
All right, look. Tell me
what triangle this is right here.

1276
00:58:40,900 --> 00:58:42,400
Um...

1277
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,000
I'm not familiar with this one.
I don't know.

1278
00:58:44,900 --> 00:58:45,900
All right.
Let me give you a hint.

1279
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:46,800
So you got MJ over there

1280
00:58:46,800 --> 00:58:47,800
posting up
a small point guard, right?

1281
00:58:47,700 --> 00:58:49,100
You got Rodman over there

1282
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:50,200
on the other side of the court
with his hair.

1283
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:51,600
Now Pippin comes
to screen for Michael.

1284
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:53,000
So what do you got?

1285
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:55,000
Well, this is the Bulls'
triangle offense, right?

1286
00:58:55,000 --> 00:58:56,000
Right.

1287
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,200
We're just givin' room
for Michael to isolate.

1288
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:01,600
Isolate. Isosceles.
An isosceles triangle.

1289
00:59:01,600 --> 00:59:02,500
Exactly.

1290
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,600
The Lakers use this triangle offense.

1291
00:59:04,600 --> 00:59:07,700
This triangle has equal sides
for Kobe and Shaq.

1292
00:59:07,600 --> 00:59:11,400
Equal sides. OK.
This is an equilateral triangle.

1293
00:59:11,300 --> 00:59:12,300
There you go.
See, you're gettin' it.

1294
00:59:12,400 --> 00:59:14,100
You're gettin' it.
OK. OK.

1295
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:15,100
Uh, I got this.

1296
00:59:15,200 --> 00:59:16,500
You got this one?

1297
00:59:16,500 --> 00:59:17,600
- OK, now this is us.
- Uh-huh.

1298
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,500
And you know the type
of triangle offense we use

1299
00:59:19,500 --> 00:59:21,600
is the acute offense...
well, the acute triangle offense.

1300
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,900
- OK.
- That's because

1301
00:59:23,000 --> 00:59:24,900
Calvin Cambridge is so damn cute.

1302
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,200
Oh, man, give me a break.
I'm the cute one.

1303
00:59:26,200 --> 00:59:27,100
- No, I am.
- No, see.

1304
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:28,100
Look at the picture.
I'm the cute one.

1305
00:59:28,100 --> 00:59:29,800
- No.
- OK, go ahead. Fine.

1306
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:31,900
All right. So...

1307
00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:34,600
OK, see, here's Joad, right?

1308
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:35,700
- Right.
- This is Joad.

1309
00:59:35,700 --> 00:59:37,100
Joad's gonna take the ball out.

1310
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,700
He's gonna pass all the way to you.

1311
00:59:39,500 --> 00:59:41,200
- OK.
- You're right here.

1312
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,200
- Right.
- See me?

1313
00:59:42,200 --> 00:59:43,500
I'm gonna be headin' down court

1314
00:59:43,600 --> 00:59:47,100
for the full-court lob pass
just like this, right?

1315
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,600
Oh, hey, Calvin. Calvin.

1316
00:59:48,700 --> 00:59:49,700
Don't put paint on
my windows, all right?

1317
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:50,800
But I'm gonna be wide open.

1318
00:59:50,900 --> 00:59:51,900
You gotta pass me the ball.

1319
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,500
I'm warning you, all right?
Don't do it.

1320
00:59:53,600 --> 00:59:55,900
And then...

1321
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,700
Wham!
2 points for me

1322
00:59:58,500 --> 01:00:01,100
and the assist...

1323
01:00:01,100 --> 01:00:02,000
to Reynolds.

1324
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:04,000
Oh, OK.
So you think you're cute

1325
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,700
puttin' the paint and then
messin' up the house, huh?

1326
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:07,000
Well, let me see what we've got.

1327
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:08,400
Let's say if I went and did...

1328
01:00:08,400 --> 01:00:11,000
Oh! Aw. Hey!

1329
01:00:11,000 --> 01:00:12,800
Orange looks nice on you, man.

1330
01:00:12,800 --> 01:00:14,000
That's not funny.

1331
01:00:14,100 --> 01:00:15,600
No, it really is funny
'cause it looks nice.

1332
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,600
It goes nice with the blue and...

1333
01:00:16,600 --> 01:00:17,600
Oh, really?

1334
01:00:17,600 --> 01:00:19,600
Yeah. You kinda look
like a rainbow or...

1335
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:21,500
Well, the orange looks really nice...

1336
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:22,500
Calvin, I know you're not gonna do that.

1337
01:00:22,500 --> 01:00:24,800
- Oh!
- On you!

1338
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:25,700
You really think it's funny?

1339
01:00:25,700 --> 01:00:27,800
No, no, no, no, no!

1340
01:00:27,800 --> 01:00:28,900
What are you doin'?
Cal. Calvin.

1341
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,300
Calvin. Whoa!

1342
01:00:30,400 --> 01:00:31,900
[Laughs]
Aah!

1343

[Buzzer]

1344
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:39,600
You must be Tracy.

1345
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:41,000
You must be Murph.

1346
01:00:40,900 --> 01:00:42,300
Yeah, that's me.

1347
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:43,400
What's up, Murph?

1348
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:44,600
Hey, Cal.
You all right?

1349
01:00:44,700 --> 01:00:45,600
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

1350
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,700
But can you believe
the cab ride here cost 50 bucks?

1351
01:00:48,700 --> 01:00:50,000
You should have took the bus.

1352
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:52,400
Tracy, can you lend me 49.50?

1353
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:53,800
Heh. All right, Murph.

1354
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:55,600
I'll go get my wallet.

1355
01:00:55,500 --> 01:00:58,100
So what have you guys been up to?

1356
01:00:58,000 --> 01:00:59,700
Geometry.

1357
01:00:59,700 --> 01:01:01,300
Think you could teach me?

01:01:01,300 --> 01:01:03,800
##All I'm tryin'to do

##I ain't in no kind of rush to grow up,

##Before you get rough with me ##

Cannonball!

1373
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,200
When Calvin Cambridge
comes to your town,

1374
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:38,400
you'd better watch out.

1375
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,000
Well, that was the fiinal word
from Gary "the Glove" Payton tonight

1376
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,800
after the Seattle Sonics battled it out

1377
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,800
with Cambridge
and the Los Angeles Knights.

1378
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,200
Yeah, now you know
what it feels like to be in the glove.

1379
01:01:48,200 --> 01:01:49,900
It's more like a mitten, Gary.

1380
01:01:49,900 --> 01:01:51,800
Kenny Mayne: The Knights rallied
around Cambridge after that,

1381
01:01:51,800 --> 01:01:54,400
and before it was all over,
Payton got the gate.

1382
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:55,500
Get him outta here, Ref.

1383
01:01:55,600 --> 01:01:56,500
Rich Eisen:
And Kenny, how about the way

1384
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:58,000
Reynolds jumped in
to protect Cambridge?

1385
01:01:58,100 --> 01:01:59,100
How about that?

1386
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,000
They're startin' to come together, Rich.

1387
01:02:00,000 --> 01:02:01,400
The team's gelling at this point,

1388
01:02:01,400 --> 01:02:03,300
and with 3 games left in the season,

1389
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:04,400
they are only 2 wins away

1390
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,600
from their fiirst ever trip
to the play-offs.

## Get your head in the game ##

Great game.

Hey, guys,

1404
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,100
I gotta pinch myself.
One more win

1405
01:02:35,100 --> 01:02:36,400
and we're in the play-offs,

1406
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:37,600
and you know what that means

1407
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,400
for every man in this organization?

1408
01:02:40,400 --> 01:02:42,900
Bonuses. Ha ha.
Contract renewals.

1409

We'll all have jobs next year.

Come on. Let's go.

1413
01:02:56,200 --> 01:03:01,000
So you still haven't met
any parents you liked?

1414
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:02,700
I don't know.

1415
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:04,100
Nobody seems right.

1416
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:05,500
Murph:
Maybe nobody seems right

1417
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:07,500
because you already met
the right person.

1418
01:03:07,500 --> 01:03:08,900
What right person?

1419

Yeah, so?

1426
01:03:20,500 --> 01:03:22,300
That doesn't mean he wants to adopt me.

Listen, Reg, Murph...

1429
01:03:26,300 --> 01:03:28,400
Tracy's not big on families.

1430
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,800
He doesn't even talk to his own dad.

1431
01:03:30,700 --> 01:03:34,100
I mean, how can you have a dad

and not talk to him?

1433

I hope she's wearin' a bikini.

Nah, it's not a woman.
It's-It's your number-one fan.

This is your dad.

01:19:51,500 --> 01:19:52,400
We can.

1767
01:19:59,600 --> 01:20:00,700
Yeah! Yeah!

Geoff:
Here come the Knights.

1769

Geoff:lf I didn't see it
with my own eyes,

1770
01:20:28,700 --> 01:20:30,000
I wouldn't have believed it.

1771
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:33,300
But they'rejust one point
behind the Raptors in this game.

1772
01:20:33,400 --> 01:20:35,100
We gotta steal the ball
on the inbound play.

1773
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:37,000
And if we don't get the steal,
who do we foul?

1774
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:38,800
They all shoot good free throws, coach.

1775
01:20:38,900 --> 01:20:41,300
Well, we better get that steal.
Ready?

- Let's go.

Geoff: The Knights
need a steal right here.

1778
01:20:45,900 --> 01:20:47,700
Carter being guarded by Cambridge.

1779
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:49,300
He comes in with it.
And he's got the ball...

1780
01:20:49,200 --> 01:20:50,900
It's stolen by Cambridge.!

1781
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:52,800
What a big play by the little guy.!

I'm done, Trace.

What do you mean?

1789
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:13,800
It really wasn't me that was playing.

1790
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:14,900
It was the sneakers.

1791
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:17,800
Tracy, the sneakers were magic.

1792
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,600
Now they're gone.

1793

We're gonna need you to win,
so you know what you gotta do?

You gotta be brave.

I believe in you.

All right. Tracy inbounds to Calvin.

1801

Calvin,Joad's gonna set you a pick.

1802
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:45,200
If they double-team you,
get the ball back to Tracy.
