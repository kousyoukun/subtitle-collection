00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:49,000
there is a winter coat here

00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,700
that's just right for you.

Sister Theresa,

169
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,200
do you know anything
about these shoes right here?

170
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,200
I'm not sure.

171
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,100
[Whispers]
It's a perfect fiit.

172
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,800
Well, the guy
who dropped them off

173
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:13,200
said they used to belong
to some famous basketball player

174
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:14,300
when he was a kid.

175
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,600
Um...which...
which basketball player?

176
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,000
Uh...

00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,600

Murph, Reg, come here, look.

181
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,800
Look at the shoes.

Was it MichaelJordan?

Go. Do your homework.

188
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,800
It's gotta be! MichaelJordan
wore these sneakers, man.

189

Yeah. I said MichaelJordan.

Yeah, how do you know

Well, I want 'em!

I gotta get those sneakers.

Suppose Ox is right
and they're not MJ's.

209
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,500
They are MJ's sneakers.

00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,600
I know they are.

00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:06,800
Then we'll get 'em in the morning.

Not in the morning.
Not while Ox is around.

213

Besides, they'll get ruined in the rain.

Well, Calvin,

seems like a really great idea.

Whoa.

The tickets were there
just like Coach Wagner said.

228
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,900
I can't believe we're gonna see
a real NBA game.

Oh, me, neither.

I'm telling Bittleman.

Geoff Witcher:
The Knights have one more chance here

238
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,500
to chip away at this lead
before halftime.

239
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,300
They're not shooting well.

240
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Open at the wing is Reynolds.

241
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,200
He puts it up...

242

Oh, no good.

Oh, man.

244
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,000
Reynolds misses another shot,

245
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,000
and that's the end of the fiirst half.

246

Minnesota Timberwolves
out in front of the Knights by 1 2,

247
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,400
and once again,

248
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,600
the Knights did not play
very good basketball

249
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,700
in the fiirst half.

250

we gotta get one of these.

331
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,200
OK, OK, Calvin.
Very good.

332
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,500
Now, you're gonna
have 60 seconds, OK?

333
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,500
Let's get the show
on the road!

334
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,300
All right, all right.
You ready, little man?

335
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,000
Man:Hey, kid, tie your shoe.

336
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,000
Thank you, sir.

337
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:16,000
We like our players to be loose,
not their laces.

338
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:22,100
[Whispers]
Make me like Mike.

339
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,700
OK...go!

340
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,800
Good luck to you, all right?
Here we go.

341
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,800
Whoo-hoo. Hoo-hoo.

342
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,000
Aw.

343
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,500
- You like that?
- I'm jealous.

344
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:37,400
- Whoo-hoo.
- Aw, OK.

345
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,800
Got that?

346
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:45,000
Very nice.

347
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,100
Calvin has just won himself
an L.A. Knights sweatshirt.

348
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,000
Computer: Chessmaster 2000.

349
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:53,600
Would you like to play a game?

350
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,400
And we begin.

351
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:56,500
Pawn to queen 4.

352
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:58,100
That was really nice.
That was really nice.

353
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,200
Really? Thanks.

354
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:03,900
Can't go that way.
Can't go that way.

355
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,800
I didn't know it was like that.

356
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,000
Yeah, you didn't know
it was like that?

357
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Uh-huh, can't go that way, either.
Come on, now.

358
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,500
Tracy Reynolds.
Man, I play "D."

359
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,300
That's what I'm playing.

360
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
Oh.

361
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,100
Whoa.

362
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,200
Oh.

363
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,900
Whoo!

364
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,000
How did I do that?

365
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,600
Now, how did he do that?

366
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,400
He just won a signed basketball
with an impressive 30-footer.

367
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,500
That one was sweet, wasn't it?

368
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:31,400
Nobody said nothing about this kid
embarrassing me out here.

369
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,500
That's your last shot, little man.
Recess is over.

370
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,800
Bernard: One more shot,

371
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,300
and he wins $ 1,000.

372
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,700
Tracy Reynolds, baby.
You got what, 9 seconds?

373
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,500
Let's do it.

374
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,400
I'm really sorry...

375
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,000
It's all right, little man.

376
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,100
Come on, little man.
Come on.

377
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,900
Come on, what you got?

378
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,100
It's my gym, baby.

379
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,300
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

380
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:51,300
Back. OK.

381
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,300
Uh-huh.

382
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,900
[Total Silence]

00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,700
Y...es.

Hah!

[Silence]

00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,100
All right, Calvin!

Whoo!

[Raucous Cheering]

390
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,700
Yeah.

391
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,700
Go, Calvin!

392
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,700
I guess this would be a bad time
for me to ask for your autograph, huh?

393
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,400
Hi there! Oh.

394
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,300
Playing a little checkers I see, huh?

395
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,700
Computer:Error. Error.

396
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,000
I was about to win.

397
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,900
So, are you the man I see
about Calvin Cambridge?

398
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,500
OK, let me get this straight...

399
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:18,000
You guys want to
have Calvin play for the Knights?

400
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:19,000
Right.

401
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,300
Why?

402
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:22,700
I been coaching 3 5 years.

403
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,500
This is the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard of.

404
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,300
Well, you didn't see him
play at halftime.

405
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,400
Hey, coach.

406
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,200
Hi...again.

407
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,300
Am I gonna be a Knight?

408
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,500
[Softly]
He's 4 1 l2 feet tall.

409
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,500
I know.

410
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:43,600
Can you imagine the press
we're gonna get?

411
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,700
Look, coach, I know attendance
is in the crapper, OK,

412
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,300
and I'm not averse to using
the word "gimmick."

413
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,700
This is about making money.

414
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:54,800
I see. And speaking of money...

415
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,000
Ah, yes, money.

416
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:59,700
Mr. Bittleman,
I'm prepared to make you an offer

417
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:04,500
of $5,000
for a one-day contract.

418
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,400
Ah...well.

419
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,100
Uh, seeing that
I'm Calvin's guardian,

420
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,600
uh...

421
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,600
I do have to make certain
that nobody takes advantage of him.

422
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,600
You mean except for you?

423
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Hey, I resent that.

424
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:24,300
Uh, Mr. Bittleman, uh, perhaps,
uh, perhaps, uh...

425
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,500
an extra 2,500 might help

426
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,400
ease your worries.

427
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,400
Deal.

428
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,900
Good.

429
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,800
I always knew that there was
something special about Calvin.

430
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,800
Wow, man, you're on the Knights.

431
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:37,300
I can't believe you're gonna
get to play in the NBA.

432
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,100
I still can't believe
what happened to me yesterday.

433
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,900
Whatever I wanted to do
with the rock, I could do.

434
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,100
Whatever I wanted to do
on the court, I could do.

435
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:43,900
And there he was...

436
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,800
Tracy Reynolds, NBA superstar...

437
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:46,900
and I outplayed him.

438
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,600
Yeah, man.
And you hit that "J." Fade-away.

439
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:51,800
Calvin: That was a swish.
That was a swish.

440
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,100
You alley-ooped yourself
off the backboard.

441
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,300
Reg: Yeah, that was hot.

442
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,800
But...how?

443
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,500
That's a good question.

444
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,100
I don't know.
All I know is that before I had these...

445
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:12,800
All: Sneakers.

446
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:15,300
I couldn't play like that
if my life depended on it.

447
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:17,700
Murph, hand me that ball.

448
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:26,800
Man...

449
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:31,000
you're like some
weird basketball Cinderella.

450
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:33,100
[Whispering]
Yeah, and the clock's
gonna strike midnight

451
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,200
if somebody fiinds out.

452
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,800
Wow, I wish I was going with you.

453
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,600
Me, too.

454
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,100
We'll be rooting for you.

455
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,400
- Come on, let's go.
-Yeah.

456
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:57,800
Hey, everybody.

457
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,800
Hey, Trace, you need
to get your notebook out

458
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,500
'cause the kid is back
to school you again.

459
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,600
Ha ha ha. Your mama.

460
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,100
[Laughter]

461
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,600
Hey, Tracy, look,
I'm sorry about the other day.

462
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,100
No, no, no.
It's all right, little man.

463
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,400
No need to be sorry, all right?
You got lucky.

464
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,600
It's all right.

Hey, I'm Joad.

466
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,700
Why don't you take
the locker next to mine?

467
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,700
Here's your uniform, Calvin.

468
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:23,700
Special ordered...
ofiicial shirt, shorts,

469
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,000
socks, and sneakers.

470
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,800
Uh, but I like my own sneakers.

471
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:32,600
Oh...ours aren't good enough
for the kid.

472
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:34,400
No, it's nothing like that.

473
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,100
It's just that
I play better in mine.

474
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,700
Play?
You just have to look good.

475
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,100
What do you mean?

476
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,200
Coach, may I please
ask you a question?

477
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,700
Sure.

478
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:56,600
Coach, I have a lot of friends
here tonight, and, uh...

479
00:21:56,300 --> 00:22:01,200
I was just wondering...
wondering, am I here to play,

480
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,100
or am I just here for show?

481
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:09,800
Calvin, I'm gonna
be straight with you.

482
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:13,800
You were hired tonight
just to increase attendance,

483
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,700
not to play.

484
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,800
Man.

485
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,100
But...I saw the tape

486
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:21,000
of that halftime show
you put on.

487
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:22,800
You got some game.

488
00:22:22,700 --> 00:22:26,700
I am honored
to have you on my team.

489
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,100
Thanks, coach.

490
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,900
You bet.

491
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:35,600
Whoo.!

492
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:35,800
Whoo.!

493
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,300
Geoff: We've got a bigger
than usual crowd tonight,

494
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:45,700
and a lot of it is curiosity.

495
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,000
The Knights have a brand new player.

496
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,500
He's 4-foot, 8-inch Calvin Cambridge,

497
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:53,300
joining us straight from the playground
of the Chesterfield group home.

498
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,400
Reggie, your reaction.

499
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,100
Geoff, this is unprecedented.

500
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:59,100
I can't imagine what the Knights players
are thinking. We'll see what happens.

501
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,100
We're gonna fiind out shortly.

502
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,300
Both clubs are taking the court

503
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,900
as we get ready
for tonight's opening tip.

504
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,800
Go Knights!

505
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:16,200
What was that?!

506
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,000
Admiral! Admiral!

507
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,100
The admiral just waved at me.

508
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,000
He just waved at me.
Admiral!

509
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,900
Hey...

510
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,000
Come on! Hey! Hey!

511
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,600
Geoff: Coach Wagner of the Knights
has seen enough.

512
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,900
He wants and gets a time-out.

513
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:44,700
Let's go. Let's go.
Good hustle, baby.

514
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
What?

515
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,100
Come on, guys.
It's not funny.

516
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,600
Now, offense, is there any play
that's gonna work for us tonight?

517
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,300
I have an idea.

518
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:56,900
Oh, man.

519
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,500
I've been watching,

520
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,900
and they're vulnerable
from the weak side,

521
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,300
especially to a pick set
away from the hoop.

522
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,300
Why don't we run
the give-and-give-and-go?

523
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,600
You mean
the give-and-go?

524
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:07,500
No, see,
they'll be expecting that.

525
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:09,600
Have Tracy feed the ball
to Henderson.

526
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,700
Henderson's gonna
feed the ball toJoad.

527
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:12,200
Joad's gonna pass it
back to Tracy.

528
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,800
As Henderson sets the pick,

529
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:16,300
Tracy's gonna take the shot.

530
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,200
I like it.

531
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,500
Oh, no. No.
I'm not gonna run some play

532
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,600
by some snotty-nosed kid, man.

533
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:24,800
Damn straight, coach.

534
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,400
Fine. Henderson, you're out.

535
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,600
Tracy, you take Henderson's slot.

536
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,500
Calvin, you take the shot.

537
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,400
What?

538
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,200
Have you lost your mind?

539
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:45,900
- You said I could play anybody I want.
- Yeah, well, I didn't mean him.

540
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,000
Am I the coach or not?

541
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:49,200
You are. For now.

542
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,300
Can you believe it, Reggie?

543
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,400
It looks like
the kid's gonna play.

544
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,900
A rousing welcome
for the man they came to see,

545
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,400
the little fella,
Calvin Cambridge,

546
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,500
into the game for the Knights.

547
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,400
Calvin! Run the play!

548
00:25:21,500 --> 00:25:23,800
What's he doin'?

549
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,500
- Run the play.
- No.

550
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:29,500
Would you just run the play?

551
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:32,500
Time out! White!

552
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,000
Why'd you call time out?

553
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:36,700
Uh...I gotta pee.

554
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,900
He's gotta pee.

Calvin Cambridge is calling for

556

a bathroom break?

00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:46,200
I guess when you gotta go,
Reggie,you gotta go.

That can mean just one thing.

That little guy,

has taken care ofbusiness
in the locker room

He's done.

Ladies and gentlemen,
this kid's for real.

567

He can play some basketball.

1 2 seconds to go,
the Knights trail by 2.

Announcer:
This is the NBA on NBC.

584
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,200
The big story in the NBA:

585
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:57,600
Calvin Cambridge,
the 4-foot-8 dynamo,

586
00:27:57,500 --> 00:27:59,400
has now signed
a lucrative contract

587
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,200
with the Knights.

588
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,400
And no wonder,
after he led them

589
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:04,200
to a come-from-behind win
over the Spurs with 27 points?

590
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,400
That kid was unbelievable.

591
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,500
Did I just see
the admiral saluting him

592
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:08,500
at the end of the game?

593
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,700
You know, Cambridge's
contract makes him

594
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,500
the youngest,
and the shortest person

595
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,100
ever to sign a deal
with the NBA.

596
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,400
He's lean, he's mean, he's 1 3.

597
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,600
Yeah, now all the kids
are gonna be saying,

598
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,700
"I wanna be like Calvin."

599
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,700
Well, I guarantee you one thing,

600
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,600
this orphan
will not be an orphan for long.

601
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:25,600
I can't believe you're going on the road
with the Knights.

602
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,100
Can I fiit in your suitcase?

603
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,500
Hey, what about me?

604
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:30,600
Bittleman.

605
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,000
Hey, Calvin, this is great.

606
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:37,500
Well, uh, I'm proud of you.

607
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,600
Listen, uh, when you're on the road,

608
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,800
uh, people might want to adopt you.

609
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:45,000
But you should realize it's, uh,

610
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:46,600
only because you're a celebrity now,

611
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,000
and, uh, they're just after your money.

612
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:53,500
Besides,your contract forbids it.

613
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,400
Wait a minute. Forbids it?

614
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:58,900
Oh, yeah.
Didn't I tell you?

615
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,400
Uh, I signed your contract
as your guardian,

616
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:06,300
so, um, as long as
you're playing for the Knights,

617
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,000
that can't change.

618
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,800
Hey, coach, check this out!

619
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,800

rent NBA Street.

we could play Monopoly.

653
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,400
Oh, yeah, I noticed.

654
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,400
Have fun, Tracy.
[Laughs]

655
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,400
All right, look.

656
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,500
Coach says I gotta room with you,

657
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,100
so let me set down the rules
right now.

658
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,000
First of all,
I ain't your boy, OK?

659
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:33,000
I'm not gonna be playin'
Monopoly with you,

660
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,100
Game Cube, Rubik's Cube...

661
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:35,600
Anything with a cube,
I ain't playin'.

662
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,000
Third, you know, I'm not gonna
be tuckin' you in at night,

663
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:38,900
and I'm defiinitely
not gonna read you

664
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,600
the Three Little Bears,
you got that?

665
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,800
Whoa! Look at this!

666
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,400
Do we always
stay in places this fancy?

667
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,300
Mm-hmm.

668
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:07,100
OK.

669
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,100
All right, I'm goin' out.

670
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:11,900
Oh, um, w-would you
like some company?

671
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,800
No. No,
I wouldn't like company.

672
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,700
Well, what do I do?

673
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,500
Uh, well, um...

674
00:31:18,300 --> 00:31:20,500
oh, call room service,
get some food.

675
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,500
But what's room service?

676
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Right. Right. OK.
Here's what you do.

677
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,300
You pick up this phone, right?

678
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,300
Mm-hmm.

679
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,300
And you dial "6".
Tell them what you want

680
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:33,600
and they'll bring it
to the room...for free.

681
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,200
For free?

682
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,800
For free.
You got it. Eat up.

683
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:38,300
No, you gotta be
messin' with me, right?

684
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:40,000
No, I'm not.
Try it yourself.

685
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:40,800
For free.

686
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,300
Hello?

687
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:47,200
Uh, yes.
Um, is this room service?

688
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,900
Yes, it is.

689
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,000
And will you really

690
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,400
bring me up
some food for free?

691
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,300
Well, sure.
Anything you like, sir.

692
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
You will?

693
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
OK, um, in that case,
I'll have a pepperoni pizza,

694
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:58,800
french fries, and cake,
ice cream, and lobster tails.

695
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,800
Lots oflobster, lots of seafood.

696
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,200
Chicken fiingers, french fries...

697
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,500
[Calvin Moaning]

698
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:09,500
Ah, man.

699
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,200
[Groans]

700
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,300
Um, you know what?
Let me...

701
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:16,800
I just want to clean up
just a little, OK?

702
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:17,700
Well, that's OK.

703
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,800
No. No. No. I just
want to clean up this...

704
00:32:18,800 --> 00:32:20,200
Hey, you're so beautiful,
I have to clean up for you.

705
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:21,200
No, it's all right.

706
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,600
OK, so I'll be right back.

707
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,900
Calvin, I need you...

708
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:25,900
Calvin, what are you doing?

709
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,200
What are you making such a mess for?

710
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,300
You were right about room service.

711
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:31,300
OK, Calvin. Calvin.

712
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,900
Know what?
I need you to get lost.

713
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:36,700
OK? I don't care where you go,
just get lost.

714
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:37,600
Joad wants to play NBA Street.

715
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,000
No, Calvin, not in there.
Calvin, no! Calvin!

716
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,300
Calvin! Calvin!

717
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,200
[Hushed]
Calvin! Calvin!

718
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:44,400
Hey.
[Chuckles]

719
00:32:44,300 --> 00:32:45,200
Hey, you know what?

720
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,600
The maid forgot to come today

721
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,700
and, you know,
maybe we could go to your place?

722
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:49,300
Is someone else in here?

723
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,000
Because I thought
I heard some voices.

724
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,200
Oh, there's...Really.
There's no one in there.

725
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,400
Oh, my God.

726
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,200
Oh, where'd he come from?

727
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,700
You're Calvin Cambridge,
aren't you?

728
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,100
Oh, my God.
Are you OK?

729
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:00,300
We're gonna get you
out of these clothes

730
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,200
and get you some air, OK?

731
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:03,000
Oh, brother. Here we go.

732
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,700
[Burps]

733
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:08,700
Oh! You are just
the sweetest thing!

734
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,500
[Giggles]
Isn't he just the sweetest thing?

735
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:12,400
[Mutters]

736
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:15,500
Tracy, you should have told me
Calvin was your roommate.

737
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:17,600
Yeah, well,
it must have slipped my mind.

738
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:19,000
See, me and Tracy are tight.

739
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,100
So that's why I call him T-time.

740
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,800
So cute.

741
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:26,900
So, what's your nickname for Calvin,
T-time?

742
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,300
I don't have one yet,

743
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,500
but, oh, so many of them
come to mind.

744
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,100
Is that better, baby?

745
00:33:33,100 --> 00:33:35,200
Yeah, I think T-time needs some, too.

746
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,200
Oh! Ha ha!

747
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:39,400
$2,000 jacket.

748

Gettin' water on a $2,000 jacket.

749
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,000
Couldn't you just eat him up?

750
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,900
Sorry about taking your girl.

751
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,900
She's not my girl,
and you didn't take her.

752
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:51,200
I don't know what it is.
It's like some type of curse.

753
00:33:51,100 --> 00:33:52,900
The girls just like me.

754
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,800
Can we go to sleep?

755
00:33:54,800 --> 00:33:56,100
Well, aren't we gonna
say our prayers?

756
00:33:56,100 --> 00:33:58,200
'Cause at the home
we always say our prayers.

757
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,200
We're not at the home.

758
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,300
Well, I can't go to sleep
until I say my prayers.

759
00:34:01,100 --> 00:34:02,600
Then say your prayers.

760
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,900
All right.

761
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,300
Well, aren't you gonna
say 'em with me?

762
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:16,300
Bow your head.
Bow your head.

763
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,500
Both:
Now I lay me down to sleep,

764
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,700
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

765
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:23,100
If I should die before I wake,

766
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:25,300
I pray the Lord my soul to take.
Amen.

Amen.

772
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,800
Anybody that you want to bless?

773
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:40,500
A girlfriend, or your parents, maybe?

774
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,200
No, my parents are gone.

775
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,200
Hey, um...

776
00:34:48,100 --> 00:34:49,900
I'm sorry.

777
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,100
I guess that makes you
an orphan like me.

778
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,700
Yeah, I guess.

779
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,200
Why don't you get in bed?

780
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:01,500
All right.
Good night.

781
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,000
There's just one thing.

782
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:07,600
Can we sleep with the light on?

783
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:08,400
'Cause at the home

784
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,400
we always sleep with the light on.

785
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,900
OK, we'll sleep with the light on.
Satisfiied?

786
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:13,500
I don't wanna hear
another sound tonight, OK?

787
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:15,600
Good night.

788

[Snoring Louder]

790
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:31,700
Oh, man.

791
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:36,000
What's the matter, Tracy?
Late night?

792
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:38,500
Yeah, real late night. Heh.

793
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,400
Ain't that right, Trace?

794
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,300
Really? How late?

795
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:44,800
See, there's this girl named Janet Kelly
came up to the room, fiine as can be.

796
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,500
She picked me and Tracy up.

797
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:49,600
We didn't come back to the room
about 1:00 in the morning.

798
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:51,000
He doesn't know better,

799
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:53,000
but you know the rule
about the ladies in the room,

800
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,900
and last time I checked,
curfew was midnight.

801
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,500
No, it was his snorin'
that kept me up all night.

802
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,400
Oh, you always got an excuse.

803
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:01,800
Look, if you think
helping him break curfew

804
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,100
is gonna get you
out ofbein'his mentor,

805
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,500
you're mistaken...

806
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,100
and if you miss curfew again,

807
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,400
I'm gonna have
to suspend you. Got it?

808
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,700
Yeah, I got it.

809
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,100
You know what, man?

810
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,200
You got to learn how to chill.

811
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,800
Tracy, I'm so sorry.
I didn't know.

812
00:36:16,700 --> 00:36:17,500
Don't worry, man.

1131
00:49:40,100 --> 00:49:41,300
That's brave.

1132
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,800
Hmm.

1133
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:46,100
Right.

1134
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,400
OK, OK. So since I'm brave
in gettin' on this plane,

1135
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:51,300
why don't you be brave...

1136
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:54,200
and turn off the light?

1137
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,200
[Sighs]

1138
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,700
I don't know.

1139
00:50:00,600 --> 00:50:01,500
Hmm.

1140
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:10,800
[Sighs]

1141
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:17,800
Are you prepared for
that big test tomorrow?

1142
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:19,400
Yes, Sister Theresa.

1143
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,900
Reg, you have to help me, please.

1144
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:25,800
I'm not helping you
with your geometry.

1145
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:26,700
Why?

1146
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,900
Because I don't understand it
any more than you do.

1147
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,900
Welcome, everybody,
and follow me into the room.

1148
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:33,600
[Chattering]

1149
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,200
Who are all those people?

1150
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:37,400
Parents, here to see you.

1151
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,300
What's wrong, Murph?
I mean, that's a good thing, right?

1152
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,600
Good for you.

1153
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,200
It doesn't do us any good.

1154
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,200
Murph.

1155
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:49,700
Congratulations.
Go get adopted.

1156
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:51,600
What's wrong with him?

1157
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,400
What do you think?

1158
00:50:52,400 --> 00:50:53,500
I don't know.

1159
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:55,600
Bittleman told me
that I couldn't get adopted.

1160
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,300
And you believe Bittleman?

1161
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,100
Coach Wagner On Phone:
His contract says nothing
about adoption.

1162
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:03,300
Look, why would you send
all of these people here?

1163
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,400
Calvin deserves a home.

1164
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:06,300
You're only interested
in making money off him.

1165
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,700
Look, with all due respect,
Coach Wagner,

1166
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:10,800
child custody law is very complex.

1167
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:12,300
Mr. Bittleman.

1168
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:14,600
Coach Wagner:Just because you
signed his contract as his guardian...

1169
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,500
I'll call you back.
I'll call you back.

1170
00:51:16,400 --> 00:51:17,800
Coach Wagner:
Wait! I'm not through talkin'...

1171
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:19,000
Yes, what is it, Calvin?

1172
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:20,300
You lied to me.

1173
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,400
What are you talking about?

1174
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,000
You told me
no one can adopt me.

1175
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,800
I never said that.

1176
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,900
Look, Calvin,

1177
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:40,100
bear in mind I have cared for you

1178
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:43,000
way before
you were rich or famous,

1179
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:44,500
and all of those people in there,

1180
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:46,000
the only reason
that they're interested in you

1181
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,400
is because you're famous.

1182
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,000
I'd like to see for myself.

1183
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,400
Well, that's fiine.

1184
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:55,600
I will, um...

1185
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:58,500
make arrangements
with the very best candidates.

1186
00:51:58,300 --> 00:52:00,500
What do you think about that,
my big man?

1187
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:01,900
We've been doing musical dinner theater
now over 6 years.

1188
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:03,100
... In over 27 cities.
... Mm-hmm.

1189
00:52:05,900 --> 00:52:10,500
No more hard-knock life
for you, Calvin.

1190
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:14,900
#The sun'll come out tomorrow #

1191
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:19,000
# Bet your bottom dollar
that tomorrow #

1192
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:20,900
#They'll be sun #

1193
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:22,900
We run a tight ship, Cambridge!

1194
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,300
Roll call 0600!

1195
00:52:24,100 --> 00:52:25,100
I think you're gonna flip

1196
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,700
for my sugar-free
seaweed rice cream.

1197
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,700
# I just stick out my chin #

1198
00:52:29,600 --> 00:52:30,700
#And grin #

1199
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:31,700
All right, good buddy.

1200
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:33,200
Now Denise here
will home school you

1201
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,100
'cause we're on the road 2 4-7.

1202
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,200
#And I say #

1203
00:52:36,200 --> 00:52:39,100
Ya, Ras Clap, ya have to
come back with me, ya seein'?

1204
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:41,300
#Tomorrow, tomorrow #

1205
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:42,800
How tall are you, boy?!
How tall are you?!

1206
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:44,400
You'll learn to hold your bladder.

1207
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:46,300
#We love ya tomorrow #

1208
00:52:46,100 --> 00:52:49,500
## You're only a day ##

1209
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,600
#Away #

1210
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,300
You see, Calvin?

1211
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,100
You're best off here...

1212
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,300
with me.

1213
00:53:07,600 --> 00:53:08,500
Hey, yo, Trace.

1214
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:09,400
Tracy: Hello?

1215
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,800
It's me, Calvin.

1216
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:11,900
Calvin. Wait. You're here?

1217
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:13,200
Yeah, I'm here,

1218
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:15,100
and it took me 4 busses
to get here, too.

1219
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,100
Uh, all right.

1220
00:53:29,100 --> 00:53:31,800
Dang.
Man, this is where you live?

1221
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,800
Calvin, what are you doing here?

1222
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,700
Hey, I just can't wait
to see the inside.

1223
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:35,700
Calvin.

1224
00:53:35,700 --> 00:53:37,400
Calvin, wait. Calvin.

1225
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:39,700
Come on, Calvin.
Tell me why you're here.

1226
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:42,400
Aw, this is tight.

1227
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,700
Look at all the stuff you got, man.

1228
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:45,600
Yeah. Yeah, it's tight.

1229
00:53:45,400 --> 00:53:47,300
So come on, man, tell me what's up.
Why you here?

1230
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:50,300
I wanna check your place out.

1231
00:53:50,100 --> 00:53:54,400
You know,just look at your crib
and everything.

1232
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:56,000
What do you call this game?

1233
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:58,400
I have no idea.
It came with the house.

1234
00:53:58,200 --> 00:53:59,600
Oh, man.

1235
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,200
So you're not gonna tell me
why you're here?

1236
00:54:01,100 --> 00:54:03,700
We need one of these
at the orphanage.

1237
00:54:03,500 --> 00:54:06,600
OK, OK. So I take it
you don't wanna tell me

1238
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,900
what's goin' on with you.
I understand.

1239
00:54:07,900 --> 00:54:08,800
It's your prerogative.
That's cool.

1240
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:10,900
No, I mean, nothin's goin' on.

1241
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:11,700
I mean, everything's all right.

1242
00:54:11,700 --> 00:54:12,700
Everything's goin' real well.

1243
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,600
Everything's perfect.

1244
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:15,200
Uh, everything's, uh,

1245
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,300
you know, uh...

1246
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:20,000
All right, man.

1247
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:22,600
Everything's goin' real
terrible right about now.

1248
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,100
My best friend Murph,
he's mad at me.

1249
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:25,200
Bittleman lied to me.

1250
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,900
He set up the worst parents
in orphan history

1251
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:29,400
to come meet with me.

1252
00:54:29,300 --> 00:54:30,600
And then, on top of that,

1253
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:33,700
I have a geometry test tomorrow,
and I hate geometry.

1254
00:54:33,500 --> 00:54:35,400
Mmm.
All right, well, listen,

1255
00:54:35,300 --> 00:54:37,600
I'm sure the right parents
are gonna show up for you, OK?

1256
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,900
It's just a question of time,
so you gotta have a little faith.

1257
00:54:39,600 --> 00:54:41,600
All right?
But in the meantime...

1258
00:54:44,900 --> 00:54:46,000
call your boy Murph.

1259
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,100
- Right now?
- Right now, yes.

1260
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:48,900
Good friends are hard to come by,

1261
00:54:48,900 --> 00:54:50,400
so you gotta keep things
straight with 'em.

1262
00:54:50,300 --> 00:54:52,200
You have your geometry work with you?

1263
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:53,400
Yeah.

1264
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,800
You know a little somethin'
about geometry?

1265
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,600
[Chuckles]
Do I know about geometry?

1266
00:54:57,500 --> 00:55:00,000
Ha ha ha!
Do I know about geometry?

1267
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:04,800
Take-Take your time on that call,

1268
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:06,400
and, um, meet me outside.

1269
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:10,200
I gotta...
I know geometry, but let me...

1270
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:17,500
OK, now, the key
to the whole geometry thing

1271
00:55:17,400 --> 00:55:20,400
and gettin' the hang of these triangles
is to super-size them.

1272
00:55:20,100 --> 00:55:21,800
- Super-size?
- Super-size.

1273
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:22,800
You painted your house.

1274
00:55:22,700 --> 00:55:24,600
All right, look. Tell me
what triangle this is right here.

1275
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:24,900
All right, look. Tell me
what triangle this is right here.

1276
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,400
Um...

1277
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:28,900
I'm not familiar with this one.
I don't know.

1278
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:29,700
All right.
Let me give you a hint.

1279
00:55:29,600 --> 00:55:30,600
So you got MJ over there

1280
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:31,500
posting up
a small point guard, right?

1281
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:32,800
You got Rodman over there

1282
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:33,700
on the other side of the court
with his hair.

1283
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,100
Now Pippin comes
to screen for Michael.

1284
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,400
So what do you got?

1285
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,400
Well, this is the Bulls'
triangle offense, right?

1286
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,200
Right.

1287
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:41,300
We're just givin' room
for Michael to isolate.

1288
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:44,600
Isolate. Isosceles.
An isosceles triangle.

1289
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:45,300
Exactly.

1290
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,400
The Lakers use this triangle offense.

1291
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:50,400
This triangle has equal sides
for Kobe and Shaq.

1292
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:53,900
Equal sides. OK.
This is an equilateral triangle.

1293
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,600
There you go.
See, you're gettin' it.

1294
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:56,300
You're gettin' it.
OK. OK.

1295
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:57,200
Uh, I got this.

1296
00:55:57,200 --> 00:55:58,500
You got this one?

1297
00:55:58,500 --> 00:55:59,600
- OK, now this is us.
- Uh-huh.

1298
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:01,400
And you know the type
of triangle offense we use

1299
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,400
is the acute offense...
well, the acute triangle offense.

1300
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:04,600
- OK.
- That's because

1301
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:06,500
Calvin Cambridge is so damn cute.

1302
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:07,700
Oh, man, give me a break.
I'm the cute one.

1303
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:08,500
- No, I am.
- No, see.

1304
00:56:08,500 --> 00:56:09,400
Look at the picture.
I'm the cute one.

1305
00:56:09,500 --> 00:56:11,200
- No.
- OK, go ahead. Fine.

1306
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:13,100
All right. So...

1307
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,700
OK, see, here's Joad, right?

1308
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:16,600
- Right.
- This is Joad.

1309
00:56:16,600 --> 00:56:18,000
Joad's gonna take the ball out.

1310
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,500
He's gonna pass all the way to you.

1311
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:21,900
- OK.
- You're right here.

1312
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:22,700
- Right.
- See me?

1313
00:56:22,800 --> 00:56:24,100
I'm gonna be headin' down court

1314
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:27,500
for the full-court lob pass
just like this, right?

1315
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,900
Oh, hey, Calvin. Calvin.

1316
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,800
Don't put paint on
my windows, all right?

1317
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:30,900
But I'm gonna be wide open.

1318
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:31,900
You gotta pass me the ball.

1319
00:56:31,800 --> 00:56:33,500
I'm warning you, all right?
Don't do it.

1320
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,700
And then...

1321
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,400
Wham!
2 points for me

1322
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,700
and the assist...

1323
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,500
to Reynolds.

1324
00:56:41,500 --> 00:56:43,400
Oh, OK.
So you think you're cute

1325
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:45,000
puttin' the paint and then
messin' up the house, huh?

1326
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:46,200
Well, let me see what we've got.

1327
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,500
Let's say if I went and did...

1328
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:50,000
Oh! Aw. Hey!

1329
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:51,700
Orange looks nice on you, man.

1330
00:56:51,600 --> 00:56:52,800
That's not funny.

1331
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,300
No, it really is funny
'cause it looks nice.

1332
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:55,200
It goes nice with the blue and...

1333
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:56,100
Oh, really?

1334
00:56:56,100 --> 00:56:58,100
Yeah. You kinda look
like a rainbow or...

1335
00:56:58,000 --> 00:56:59,900
Well, the orange looks really nice...

1336
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,700
Calvin, I know you're not gonna do that.

1337
00:57:00,700 --> 00:57:03,000
- Oh!
- On you!

1338
00:57:02,800 --> 00:57:03,800
You really think it's funny?

1339
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,800
No, no, no, no, no!

1340
00:57:05,700 --> 00:57:06,800
What are you doin'?
Cal. Calvin.

1341
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:08,200
Calvin. Whoa!

1344
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:16,900
You must be Tracy.

1345
00:57:16,900 --> 00:57:18,200
You must be Murph.

1346
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:19,500
Yeah, that's me.

1347
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:20,500
What's up, Murph?

1348
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:21,700
Hey, Cal.
You all right?

1349
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:22,500
Yeah, I'm pretty good.

1350
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:25,600
But can you believe
the cab ride here cost 50 bucks?

1351
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:26,700
You should have took the bus.

1352
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,000
Tracy, can you lend me 49.50?

1353
00:57:28,900 --> 00:57:30,300
Heh. All right, Murph.

1354
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:32,000
I'll go get my wallet.

1355
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:34,500
So what have you guys been up to?

1356
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,900
Geometry.

1357
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:37,400

1373

When Calvin Cambridge
comes to your town,

1374
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:12,400
you'd better watch out.

1375
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:14,900
Well, that was the fiinal word
from Gary "the Glove" Payton tonight

1376
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,500
after the Seattle Sonics battled it out

1377
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,500
with Cambridge
and the Los Angeles Knights.

1378
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,600
Yeah, now you know
what it feels like to be in the glove.

1379
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:23,200
It's more like a mitten, Gary.

1380
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:25,000
Kenny Mayne: The Knights rallied
around Cambridge after that,

1381
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:27,600
and before it was all over,
Payton got the gate.

1382
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,500
Get him outta here, Ref.

1383
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:29,400
Rich Eisen:
And Kenny, how about the way

1384
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:30,900
Reynolds jumped in
to protect Cambridge?

1385
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,800
How about that?

1386
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:32,700
They're startin' to come together, Rich.

1387
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:34,000
The team's gelling at this point,

1388
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:35,900
and with 3 games left in the season,

1389
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:36,900
they are only 2 wins away

1390
00:58:36,900 --> 00:58:39,000

to the play-offs.

One more win

00:59:05,800 --> 00:59:07,100
and we're in the play-offs,

1406
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,200
and you know what that means

1407
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,900
for every man in this organization?

Come on. Let's go.

1413
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:30,500
So you still haven't met
any parents you liked?

1414

I don't know.

00:59:31,800 --> 00:59:33,200
Nobody seems right.

1416

Murph:
Maybe nobody seems right

1417
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,400
because you already met
the right person.

1418

What right person?

He doesn't even talk to his own dad.

01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:23,900
We can.

1767
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,800
Yeah! Yeah!

Here come the Knights.

Geoff:lf I didn't see it
with my own eyes,

1770
01:15:58,100 --> 01:15:59,400
I wouldn't have believed it.

1771
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:02,700
But they'rejust one point
behind the Raptors in this game.

1772
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:04,300
We gotta steal the ball
on the inbound play.

1773
01:16:04,100 --> 01:16:06,100
And if we don't get the steal,
who do we foul?

1774
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:07,800
They all shoot good free throws, coach.

1775
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:10,100
Well, we better get that steal.
Ready?

- Let's go.

need a steal right here.

01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:16,100
Carter being guarded by Cambridge.

1779
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:17,600
He comes in with it.
And he's got the ball...

1780
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,200
It's stolen by Cambridge.!

1781
01:16:19,100 --> 01:16:21,000
What a big play by the little guy.!

I'm done, Trace.

What do you mean?

1789
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,800
It really wasn't me that was playing.

1790
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:41,700
It was the sneakers.

1791
01:16:41,700 --> 01:16:44,600
Tracy, the sneakers were magic.

1792
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,200
Now they're gone.

1793

We're gonna need you to win,
so you know what you gotta do?

You gotta be brave.

I believe in you.

All right. Tracy inbounds to Calvin.

1801

Calvin,Joad's gonna set you a pick.

1802
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:10,500
If they double-team you,
get the ball back to Tracy.
