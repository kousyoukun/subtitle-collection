1
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:17,344
Stieg Larsson's
The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo

2
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:02,499
The long awaited verdict is expected today
in the Wennerström case,

3
00:03:02,509 --> 00:03:05,115
in which journalist
and well known editor...

4
00:03:05,116 --> 00:03:08,616
of the largest magazine Millennium,
Mikael Blomkvist,

5
00:03:08,758 --> 00:03:11,367
is accused of writing
a lengthy series...

6
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:15,779
of defamatory articles on financier
Hans-Erik Wennerström.

7
00:03:16,064 --> 00:03:19,710
Blomkvist has accused Wennerström
of misappropriating funds...

8
00:03:19,719 --> 00:03:23,871
totalling 60 million kroner, as well
as being involved in arms trafficking.

9
00:03:24,314 --> 00:03:27,019
Swedes have always been divided
when it comes to the articles...

10
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,120
written by Blomkvist.

11
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:32,422
His supporters maintain that he alone
represents the last bastion...

12
00:03:32,431 --> 00:03:34,942
of idealistic journalism
in this country.

13
00:03:34,985 --> 00:03:39,986
But today Mikael Blomkvist's long career as
a watchdog journalist could come to an end.

14
00:03:44,094 --> 00:03:46,496
In the case of Wennerström
versus Millennium,

15
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:50,603
the accused Mikael Blomkvist has been
found guilty of 6 of the 8 charges...

16
00:03:50,604 --> 00:03:52,704
of aggravated libel
laid against him.

17
00:03:53,263 --> 00:03:56,481
The accused is sentenced
to three months in prison...

18
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:02,913
and is ordered to pay Hans-Erik Wennerström
150,000 kroner in punitive damages.

19
00:04:06,514 --> 00:04:07,514
Mr. Wennerström.

20
00:04:09,853 --> 00:04:11,053
A statement please, sir.

21
00:04:11,054 --> 00:04:13,299
We need to sanction those people
like Kalle Blomkvist...

22
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:15,289
who seek to destroy the life
of honest people...

23
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,190
just because they don't happen to share
the same political opinion.

24
00:04:19,324 --> 00:04:21,609
What's your next course of action?
- I have no further comment.

25
00:04:24,177 --> 00:04:25,835
- Oh, there he is.
- He's coming now.

26
00:04:26,055 --> 00:04:28,232
What do you think of your
reputation right now, sir?

27
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:29,133
It's fantastic.

28
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:30,903
Mr. Blomkvist, over here!

29
00:04:31,304 --> 00:04:33,404
Your protege
doesn't really deserve this.

30
00:04:33,405 --> 00:04:35,205
What about your future
with Millennium?

31
00:04:35,307 --> 00:04:38,226
Merry Christmas everyone.
- Skoal. Skoal.

32
00:04:38,227 --> 00:04:39,527
Merry Christmas, Skoal.

33
00:04:39,827 --> 00:04:40,727
Skoal.

34
00:04:40,794 --> 00:04:42,895
So, for the appeal,
what are we thinking?

35
00:04:42,998 --> 00:04:46,592
Micke, you know we're behind you 100%.

36
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,804
We are right, sir.

37
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:49,705
Our advertisers
are losing confidence in us.

38
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:52,160
Launching an appeal
won't regain their confidence.

39
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,361
No, but it might buy us some time,
to win back some of our readers.

40
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:57,488
I made up my mind, no appeal.
- It isn't only about you,

41
00:04:57,489 --> 00:04:59,272
what about Millennium?
- The sooner this is over,

42
00:04:59,273 --> 00:05:02,334
the better it'll be for Millennium.
Let it go.

43
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:06,438
Listen, I was just playing
devil's advocate here, but...

44
00:05:06,447 --> 00:05:11,192
I think it might be a good idea if Mikael
dropped out of circulation for a while.

45
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,145
Give this thing a chance
to blow over.

46
00:05:19,645 --> 00:05:21,596
Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

47
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,928
Micke, wait up.

48
00:05:29,863 --> 00:05:33,232
You're still in shock, you know that.
- Ah, come on, Janne's got it right.

49
00:05:33,242 --> 00:05:35,255
I screwed up royally,
and now I look like an idiot.

50
00:05:35,256 --> 00:05:37,956
But there has to be another way,
we just have to find it.

51
00:05:38,164 --> 00:05:40,115
There's nothing left in here.

52
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:44,262
I haven't written a single word
in over a month.

53
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,533
Understand?

54
00:06:37,493 --> 00:06:41,079
Wennerström
KO's Blomkvist

55
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:50,588
Prison For Mikael Blomkvist

56
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:58,872
Goddamn.

57
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:26,377
As the general rule, we don't normally
introduce our researchers to our clients.

58
00:07:26,587 --> 00:07:29,565
But under the circumstances and
the important person you represent...

59
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,032
we'll make an exception.

60
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:33,593
I appreciate that.
- I should probably warn you.

61
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:38,732
Lisbeth is a young woman who's a bit...
well, special, shall we say.

62
00:07:38,733 --> 00:07:39,733
What do you mean special?

63
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,753
Oh, please don't be fooled by her
appearance, she's our best researcher.

64
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:44,646
Ah-huh.

65
00:07:44,647 --> 00:07:46,023
Good morning, Lisbeth.

66
00:07:51,362 --> 00:07:52,697
Good morning.

67
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:55,774
Dirch Frode.

68
00:07:57,975 --> 00:08:00,375
Please.
Sit down.

69
00:08:19,775 --> 00:08:21,935
Transcripts of text messages.

70
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:26,048
His E-mails.
His Bank statements.

71
00:08:27,483 --> 00:08:30,027
How did you get access
to all this information?

72
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:33,397
None of your business,
you ask for it, I delivered it.

73
00:08:36,935 --> 00:08:40,020
What can you tell me
about Mr. Blomkvist?

74
00:08:40,105 --> 00:08:45,092
It's all in my report.
- I want the short version.

75
00:08:46,086 --> 00:08:49,814
Mikael Blomkvist, nicknamed Kalle Blomkvist
after the fictional detective...

76
00:08:49,815 --> 00:08:51,884
when he solved a series
of bank robberies in the eighties.

77
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:53,796
Since then he's become
a well known public figure,

78
00:08:53,797 --> 00:08:56,697
the rest is well documented,
it's all in there, if you wanna know more.

79
00:08:57,723 --> 00:09:00,953
Yes, but I'm sure
he must have some secrets?

80
00:09:00,954 --> 00:09:02,354
We all have secrets.

81
00:09:02,604 --> 00:09:04,732
And do you know
what kind of impact...

82
00:09:04,733 --> 00:09:07,033
the whole Millennium affair
had on Blomkvist?

83
00:09:07,441 --> 00:09:10,638
From a financial point of view?
- You just have to read my report.

84
00:09:10,739 --> 00:09:12,139
It's all there.
- Lisbeth...

85
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:14,899
Miss Salander, are you sure
you don't have anything else to add?

86
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:19,595
You know, personal observation?
Anything strike you?

87
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:22,574
Something fishy
about the Wennerström thing.

88
00:09:23,325 --> 00:09:24,413
Meaning what?

89
00:09:26,314 --> 00:09:28,014
You have any new evidence
to divulge?

90
00:09:28,022 --> 00:09:30,798
You hired me to investigate Blomkvist,
not to do his job.

91
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:34,246
I know he's good, but I would still
like to know your personal opinion.

92
00:09:34,447 --> 00:09:36,547
Now, tell me.
- Blomkvist is clean.

93
00:09:37,256 --> 00:09:39,975
I didn't find anything on him,
not even a parking ticket.

94
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:43,838
I don't think he made up those stories
about Wennerström.

95
00:09:43,948 --> 00:09:45,807
I think he got screwed over.

96
00:09:48,477 --> 00:09:50,069
Why didn't you consult me on this?

97
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:53,626
Because no lawyer in Stockholm
or anywhere else wanted to touch the case.

98
00:09:53,627 --> 00:09:55,527
Yes I know.
I read the trial report.

99
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:58,411
So then you know
why I didn't wanna get you involved.

100
00:09:58,462 --> 00:09:59,900
That wouldn't have bother me at all.

101
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:03,201
What did bother me was, that you didn't
consult me, I'm your sister.

102
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:05,502
I know that.
- I feel so much better, thank you.

103
00:10:05,512 --> 00:10:09,298
They ruined my reputation. I wasn't about
to let them drag my family through the mud.

104
00:10:09,324 --> 00:10:12,493
Well, now you go to prison, is that it?
It's insane.

105
00:10:12,602 --> 00:10:15,067
This is a family secret
for making the best meatballs.

106
00:10:15,068 --> 00:10:18,368
You start by wetting the tips
of your fingers, this is very important.

107
00:10:18,369 --> 00:10:19,269
Watch...

108
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:23,937
and next, you roll the meat in your hands,
always counterclockwise like this.

109
00:10:23,947 --> 00:10:26,423
Can you get that for me, please?
- Okay.

110
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,056
Hello, this is Micke Blomkvist.
- No, no, no.

111
00:10:31,057 --> 00:10:33,223
She does it always.
- Hello?

112
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:36,427
This is Mikael.
- Mikael Blomkvist?

113
00:10:36,536 --> 00:10:41,265
Yes, that's me. Who's this?
- My name's Dirch Frode.

114
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:44,627
I'm a lawyer and I have a client who's
very interested in meeting with you.

115
00:10:44,695 --> 00:10:46,640
It's Christmas, I'm with family.
What's it about?

116
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:49,341
My client would prefer
to speak with you personally.

117
00:10:49,549 --> 00:10:52,626
Call Millennium after the holidays,
we'll set up an appointment then.

118
00:10:52,627 --> 00:10:55,446
My client is an elderly gentlemen,
I'm afraid he can't wait 'till then...

119
00:10:55,489 --> 00:10:57,708
Who's your client?
- Henrik Vanger.

120
00:10:57,709 --> 00:10:59,109
Henrik Vanger?

121
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,194
Of the Vanger Corporation?

122
00:11:01,245 --> 00:11:04,181
Mr. Vanger would be extremely grateful
if you'd come.

123
00:11:04,632 --> 00:11:08,194
Listen, sir, it's Christmas, I'm with
my family and I've had a hell of a week.

124
00:11:08,262 --> 00:11:12,322
I guarantee you, you should come,
Mr. Vanger will reward you generously.

125
00:11:34,514 --> 00:11:36,098
Blomkvist!

126
00:11:43,007 --> 00:11:48,402
Henrik lives on Hedeby,
it's a couple of km from Hedestad.

127
00:11:57,111 --> 00:12:00,115
The bridge is the only link
to the mainland.

128
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:15,500
There was a time,
when the Swedish business elite...

129
00:12:15,501 --> 00:12:17,301
would come to the Vanger estate.

130
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,061
Today Henrik lives here alone
with Anna, the housekeeper.

131
00:12:29,447 --> 00:12:31,355
Thank you for coming, Mikael.

132
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:36,761
I must say the phone call from Frode
really peaked my curiosity.

133
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:40,059
You must be hungry,
would you like some lunch?

134
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,060
Thanks.
But why don't we get on to it

135
00:12:42,543 --> 00:12:46,464
I like to catch the night train back.
- Oh, very well, we skip lunch.

136
00:12:47,165 --> 00:12:48,265
Thank you.

137
00:12:54,139 --> 00:12:55,556
Do you remember her?

138
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:02,330
It's Harriet, Harriet Vanger,
my brother Gottfried's daughter.

139
00:13:03,524 --> 00:13:05,441
You knew her, didn't you?

140
00:13:06,653 --> 00:13:07,962
Did I meet her?

141
00:13:09,531 --> 00:13:14,901
Your father, he worked for me
during the summer of 1965.

142
00:13:14,902 --> 00:13:17,714
He was a workshop foreman,
at our factory in Hedestad.

143
00:13:18,115 --> 00:13:19,815
And he lived in one of our chalets.

144
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:25,727
Your mother and you,
would visit on weekends.

145
00:13:27,216 --> 00:13:29,217
Harriet would look after you.

146
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:33,179
The two of you,
would often play there, by the water.

147
00:13:37,184 --> 00:13:39,185
Yes, I remember her.

148
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:45,191
Harriet.
- Yes, I never had children of my own.

149
00:13:45,793 --> 00:13:50,281
She was the apple of my eye.
She was young, intelligent.

150
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,826
I thought of her as
my own daughter.

151
00:13:55,237 --> 00:13:56,537
I see.

152
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:58,706
What happened to her?

153
00:14:01,252 --> 00:14:06,096
I believe she was murdered.
- Murdered?

154
00:14:10,678 --> 00:14:16,057
Here... the Vanger family, Mikael.
My family.

155
00:14:17,069 --> 00:14:23,431
The 22nd of September 1966. The entire
Vanger family gathered here in this house

156
00:14:23,432 --> 00:14:26,110
for the annual board
of directors meeting.

157
00:14:26,737 --> 00:14:31,164
They were all there, 30 vultures,
they were only here for the money.

158
00:14:31,658 --> 00:14:35,345
Where they could tear each other to pieces,
to get the biggest piece of the pie.

159
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:38,956
Look closely...
because one of them...

160
00:14:41,109 --> 00:14:42,961
was Harriet’s killer.

161
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:49,158
Harriet was barely 16 at the time.
which was...

162
00:14:50,059 --> 00:14:51,659
Children's Day.

163
00:14:51,677 --> 00:14:55,433
She had gone to Hedestad to watch
the parade in the main street.

164
00:14:55,442 --> 00:14:58,268
This photo was featured
in the local paper.

165
00:14:59,229 --> 00:15:02,815
Around two o'clock,
she returned to the island, and...

166
00:15:03,484 --> 00:15:06,276
she wanted to talk me
about something, but...

167
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:09,197
I was busy dealing
the meeting.

168
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,992
How was she murdered?

169
00:15:14,954 --> 00:15:20,033
No one seems to know.
She just disappeared.

170
00:15:21,711 --> 00:15:24,087
I can see
you prepared everything for me.

171
00:15:25,423 --> 00:15:29,309
I've spend the last 40 years going over
what could have happened that day.

172
00:15:29,402 --> 00:15:32,220
You could say I've had time,
to organize

173
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:39,729
At 2:15 there was a tragic accident,
on the hill at the bridge.

174
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:45,118
A tanker truck lost control and skidded into
the incoming lane and hit a car head on.

175
00:15:45,703 --> 00:15:48,238
The truck jackknifed
and lay on its side.

176
00:15:48,522 --> 00:15:53,109
Gasoline had leaked all over the road,
covering both lanes of the bridge.

177
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,710
and closing traffic.

178
00:15:54,718 --> 00:15:57,673
Preventing anyone,
from leaving the island.

179
00:15:58,082 --> 00:16:01,652
As luck would have it,
a camera captured it all.

180
00:16:02,337 --> 00:16:04,380
There, look...
in that window.

181
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:09,844
Those are last images
we have of Harriet.

182
00:16:11,346 --> 00:16:16,635
It was inspector Morell from the
Hedestad Police, who headed the enquiry.

183
00:16:16,844 --> 00:16:22,315
He found this piece of film, and he had
several enlargements made of this photo.

184
00:16:22,758 --> 00:16:26,994
And this, this one here,
is my last picture of Harriet.

185
00:16:27,822 --> 00:16:32,534
We waited for her at dinner,
but she never arrived.

186
00:16:36,088 --> 00:16:38,331
Hello?
- Lisbeth Salander?

187
00:16:38,374 --> 00:16:40,670
Yes, who is this?
- Hello, I'm Miss Svensson...

188
00:16:40,671 --> 00:16:42,071
from the probation department.

189
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:45,857
I'm calling to inform you, that you have
a new guardian, his name is Eric Bjurman..

190
00:16:45,858 --> 00:16:47,533
I already have a guardian,
what is this?

191
00:16:47,593 --> 00:16:52,664
Please let me finish, Your previous guardian
has had a stroke and is in the hospital...

192
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:55,391
we had no choice
but to replace him.

193
00:16:56,569 --> 00:16:59,356
Nice to meet you, even under these
unfortunate circumstances.

194
00:16:59,357 --> 00:17:01,057
Please sit.
- Thank you.

195
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:07,653
Yes, it's somewhat regrettable
that my predecessor...

196
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:09,609
Palmgren seemed to be rather lax...

197
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,710
in his application of the rules
concerning the guardianship.

198
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:16,756
I see here for example that he
allowed you to manage your own money.

199
00:17:16,765 --> 00:17:22,118
That never had a problem.
- No, I don't doubt that for a moment.

200
00:17:22,461 --> 00:17:25,725
As you very well know, I'm the one
who's responsible for you now...

201
00:17:25,726 --> 00:17:27,426
legally and financially.

202
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,672
Do you know what that means?

203
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:32,873
It means that I would to blame, if you
spend to much and can't pay your rent.

204
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:36,093
I got a job you know, I'm earning a living,
which shouldn’t be a problem.

205
00:17:38,437 --> 00:17:43,542
You're also employed at, uh...
Milton Securities, I see here.

206
00:17:43,743 --> 00:17:44,643
Yeah.

207
00:17:44,687 --> 00:17:48,547
What do you do there?
- Make coffee do some photocopies.

208
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:50,548
Oh, I see.

209
00:17:52,328 --> 00:17:54,321
Alright, this is how I see it:

210
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:55,757
Starting from today,

211
00:17:55,758 --> 00:17:59,658
your salary will be deposited directly
into a new account, managed by me.

212
00:17:59,860 --> 00:18:04,539
The 1st of month we'll let you have
enough money to cover your personal expense,

213
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:08,894
anything over and above that,
we'll have to discuss, okay?

214
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:18,521
Let's talk a bit,
about your hygiene.

215
00:18:19,022 --> 00:18:20,398
What do you mean?

216
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:26,528
All these piercings that you have.
Aren't you worried about infections?

217
00:18:29,784 --> 00:18:31,785
Do you have a boyfriend?

218
00:18:33,037 --> 00:18:34,580
No.

219
00:18:35,373 --> 00:18:37,624
Have you had sexual relation?

220
00:18:38,751 --> 00:18:40,502
I'm 24.

221
00:18:41,761 --> 00:18:46,408
Your real life is here,
I can say you've been cooperative,

222
00:18:47,293 --> 00:18:50,388
or you've been problematic
and obstinate.

223
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:55,185
And your life could become,
very, very, complicated.

224
00:18:57,121 --> 00:18:59,881
So, how many men
have you had sex with?

225
00:19:03,027 --> 00:19:04,727
Two.
- Two?

226
00:19:07,031 --> 00:19:09,958
2 hundred.
No, 2 thousand.

227
00:19:10,010 --> 00:19:14,738
200 thousand, are we done?
- And what's your favourite position?

228
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,542
Do you have a special preference?

229
00:19:24,048 --> 00:19:25,967
Did you ever think
she may have run away?

230
00:19:26,177 --> 00:19:31,054
You have to keep the accident in mind.
The truck blocked the bridge for 24 hours.

231
00:19:31,065 --> 00:19:33,434
And the bridge
is the only way off the island.

232
00:19:33,560 --> 00:19:37,053
So Harriet disappeared,
when nobody could leave the island.

233
00:19:37,063 --> 00:19:42,635
Precisely, it was only the following day we
realized that may have been a criminal act.

234
00:19:42,644 --> 00:19:46,314
They reopened the bridge and the murderer
could've disposed of the body.

235
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:48,115
It's the only proof
of a scenario.

236
00:19:48,123 --> 00:19:50,101
Have you ever considered,
suicide or drowning?

237
00:19:50,102 --> 00:19:51,902
Oh, they dragged the channel.

238
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:56,374
They looked everywhere, with dogs,
divers and still found nothing.

239
00:19:56,933 --> 00:19:59,186
Even today,
during my walks,

240
00:20:00,029 --> 00:20:02,488
I catch myself looking for her.

241
00:20:05,217 --> 00:20:10,188
Harriet was only eight, when she first
made me a present for my birthday.

242
00:20:10,198 --> 00:20:13,700
A bluebell,
that was in 1958.

243
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:16,904
Then every year after,
another flower.

244
00:20:18,023 --> 00:20:21,708
1966.
The year Harriet disappeared.

245
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,572
This... this is the attic.

246
00:20:43,525 --> 00:20:44,892
It's crazy.

247
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:49,788
Every damn year since, I received a flower
in the mail for my birthday.

248
00:20:50,298 --> 00:20:52,216
They come from
all over the world.

249
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:57,938
Who do you think, could be doing that?
- Harriet’s' murderer.

250
00:20:59,066 --> 00:21:03,545
You don't know my family. You have
no idea what they're capable of.

251
00:21:06,364 --> 00:21:10,753
I always favoured Harriet.
That made her easy prey for everyone.

252
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:14,663
The power-hungry, blood-suckers,
the whole Vanger Group.

253
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:18,862
They wanted a piece of me.

254
00:21:20,672 --> 00:21:24,967
I am 82 years old.
The police gave up long ago.

255
00:21:25,177 --> 00:21:28,554
And I need to know
what happened, before I die.

256
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:31,682
Help me at last, find out
what really transpired.

257
00:21:31,808 --> 00:21:35,061
Yes, but how can I...?
- I followed your career for years.

258
00:21:35,228 --> 00:21:38,105
You're an excellent reporter,
you're tenacious.

259
00:21:38,115 --> 00:21:42,694
Now, I'm not asking you to solve
the case, but to do your utmost.

260
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:46,556
You have six months, before you
have to begin serving your sentence.

261
00:21:49,118 --> 00:21:51,319
Forgive me, but you've spend
the last 40 years...

262
00:21:51,329 --> 00:21:55,165
I'll pay you handsomely,
and cover all your expenses.

263
00:21:55,375 --> 00:22:00,204
You will be a wealthy man,
with nothing to lose, hm?

264
00:22:00,547 --> 00:22:03,549
And there's nothing waiting for you
in Stockholm.

265
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:16,013
"Mikael Blomkvist resigns as editor
from Millennium...

266
00:22:16,022 --> 00:22:18,731
and announced, that he will never work
for the magazine again".

267
00:22:18,774 --> 00:22:22,736
Did you really write this?
Without even talking to me?

268
00:22:25,408 --> 00:22:28,659
I'm sorry, but...
it was my decision to make.

269
00:22:33,749 --> 00:22:35,749
What are you gonna do now?

270
00:22:36,418 --> 00:22:39,420
I'm going to work
for Henrik Vanger, in Hedestad.

271
00:22:39,629 --> 00:22:41,589
Henrik Vanger?

272
00:22:42,758 --> 00:22:46,428
Say? You're playing with
the capitalists now.

273
00:22:47,663 --> 00:22:50,599
I'm not working
for the Vanger Corporation.

274
00:22:54,854 --> 00:22:56,771
You mean, you're getting a new place?

275
00:22:57,399 --> 00:22:58,399
Yeah.

276
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,192
In Hedestad?

277
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:09,995
Good luck.

278
00:24:20,019 --> 00:24:21,354
Now what, dork?

279
00:24:21,555 --> 00:24:22,755
Dude, come on.

280
00:24:29,970 --> 00:24:31,956
Dork!
What're you looking at?

281
00:24:36,735 --> 00:24:38,479
Watch where you goin', bitch!

282
00:24:40,465 --> 00:24:41,641
Come on, now!

283
00:24:41,642 --> 00:24:43,142
Keep drinking all this stuff.

284
00:24:43,342 --> 00:24:44,242
Ow!

285
00:24:48,890 --> 00:24:51,068
You crazy bitch!
- Grab her arm!

286
00:24:51,069 --> 00:24:52,269
Come on!
- Fuck.

287
00:24:59,502 --> 00:25:00,702
Come on!
- Let's get outta here.

288
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:03,272
This bitch is fucking crazy.
- Motherfuckers!

289
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:06,834
Come on.
- Crazy bitch!

290
00:25:22,175 --> 00:25:23,802
Oh, fuck.

291
00:25:24,929 --> 00:25:26,388
Can you fix it?

292
00:25:28,932 --> 00:25:31,601
I can save your hard drive.
- Good.

293
00:25:36,899 --> 00:25:38,775
And the rest?

294
00:25:42,489 --> 00:25:44,482
You better start looking
for holiday promos.

295
00:25:44,483 --> 00:25:45,483
Shit.

296
00:25:47,685 --> 00:25:51,447
What happened?
- I got mugged.

297
00:25:54,959 --> 00:25:57,503
You stink of booze.

298
00:25:57,755 --> 00:26:00,633
Yeah I know, you smell
smell like roses?

299
00:26:05,804 --> 00:26:08,349
You can always use that one,
the PC over there.

300
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:11,685
I use it for my back-up,
so it has to stay here.

301
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,794
Welcome to Hedeby.

302
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:39,181
Oh, the cold air feels good, doesn't it?
Freshens you up...

303
00:26:39,182 --> 00:26:40,182
to say the least.

304
00:26:40,207 --> 00:26:44,287
Since you would prefer not to stay
in the main house, I put you in here.

305
00:26:44,288 --> 00:26:45,588
I hope you'll be comfortable.

306
00:26:51,294 --> 00:26:55,214
If it gets much colder,
the pipes are likely to freeze.

307
00:26:55,581 --> 00:26:58,234
You can get water
at the main house.

308
00:26:58,443 --> 00:26:59,747
Yes?
- The boxes, sir.

309
00:26:59,748 --> 00:27:02,948
Ah, good.
Put them over there.

310
00:27:05,535 --> 00:27:08,539
The boxes contain already some
of the information...

311
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,440
I've gathered on Harriet,
through the years.

312
00:27:11,958 --> 00:27:16,420
You'll find photographs,
police reports. Everything you'll need.

313
00:27:17,422 --> 00:27:18,952
There are also press-clippings.

314
00:27:18,953 --> 00:27:23,453
And you'll find, I even organized
Harriet's personal effects.

315
00:27:25,056 --> 00:27:27,557
Anyway, it should be good
for a start.

316
00:28:18,636 --> 00:28:20,345
You were a great babysitter.

317
00:28:41,744 --> 00:28:43,262
What happened to you?

318
00:29:05,863 --> 00:29:07,863
The Vanger group.

319
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:34,023
Keep Sweden pure!

320
00:29:34,191 --> 00:29:37,193
We are the Swedish
National Socialists -

321
00:29:37,278 --> 00:29:42,115
and the Aryan race
can't do without us!

322
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,737
For all intensive purposes...

323
00:29:52,738 --> 00:29:56,038
the Vanger family was made up
of a thoroughly unpleasant bunch.

324
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:58,109
There was a mutual
hatred among us,

325
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:01,410
but we tolerated each other
for the good of the corporation.

326
00:30:02,053 --> 00:30:04,221
That house belonged
to my brother Harald.

327
00:30:05,307 --> 00:30:08,601
To say that we're not exactly close,
is an understatement.

328
00:30:10,896 --> 00:30:16,034
So your two brothers Richard and Harald,
had ties with the fascist group in the 30's.

329
00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:19,487
Yes, I can see,
that you've done your homework.

330
00:30:20,556 --> 00:30:23,925
Then there was Gottfried,
he was a member of the Hitler Youth.

331
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:28,221
Let's not mince words, shall we?
All three were Nazis.

332
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:33,927
Yes. Fanatics, all of them.

333
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:38,024
Richard was killed
in Finnish Winter War.

334
00:30:39,909 --> 00:30:44,805
Harald became an embitter old man.
He rarely leaves his house.

335
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:51,063
Harald's daughter Cecilia,
is in Scotland presently.

336
00:30:52,072 --> 00:30:55,449
Cecilia and Harald
are no longer at speaking terms.

337
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:05,577
That house up there
belongs to Martin, Harriet’s' brother.

338
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:10,165
He replaced me as head
of the Vanger Corporation.

339
00:31:11,209 --> 00:31:12,401
Hello.

340
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:17,583
And so. You must be
the famous Kalle Blomkvist.

341
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,593
It's Mikael, call me Mikael,
then I know who you're talking to.

342
00:31:21,503 --> 00:31:24,014
I'm anxious to find out,
why is that...

343
00:31:24,224 --> 00:31:27,768
you're prepared to spend 6 months,
in this godforsaken place.

344
00:31:30,312 --> 00:31:33,199
Martin's and Harriet's father,
Gottfried,

345
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:37,111
lived a life of misery and alcoholism,
with his wife Isabella.

346
00:31:38,738 --> 00:31:43,368
I've never seen a woman less adapted being
a mother, then Isabella was with Harriet.

347
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,633
I intervened and became involved
in Martin and Harriet's lives.

348
00:31:53,237 --> 00:31:56,296
Later on every Vanger
who lived here.

349
00:31:56,339 --> 00:31:59,526
Most of the time, there were
considerably more of us.

350
00:31:59,527 --> 00:32:03,472
Cecilia's sister Anita died
from cancer, years ago.

351
00:32:04,124 --> 00:32:07,977
Greger Vanger, Ulrika Vanger.
- Stop, just a minute.

352
00:32:08,186 --> 00:32:10,062
Who is it, you suspect?

353
00:32:13,191 --> 00:32:14,566
None of 'em.

354
00:32:15,444 --> 00:32:18,738
All of them.
That's where you come in.

355
00:32:56,361 --> 00:33:01,157
Dear Diary. Today I got this diary
from my dear uncle Henrik.

356
00:33:01,325 --> 00:33:03,743
A kind, but busy, man.

357
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:08,165
He's finally home from his travels
and brought me this diary.

358
00:33:09,417 --> 00:33:14,589
I'm by myself in my dad's cottage.
Anita will be here soon.

359
00:34:13,526 --> 00:34:16,904
So you're the one
sniffing around in family matters?

360
00:34:17,447 --> 00:34:20,448
Hell, you scared me.

361
00:34:21,450 --> 00:34:25,121
Cecilia Vanger.
Henrik said you'd be here.

362
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,832
Mikael Blomkvist.
- I recognize you from the papers.

363
00:34:29,918 --> 00:34:32,838
What have you found?
- Harriet's Bible.

364
00:34:34,507 --> 00:34:37,426
She was often up here
with my sister.

365
00:34:37,468 --> 00:34:39,427
Anita?
- Yes.

366
00:34:39,469 --> 00:34:42,681
The summer before she disappeared.

367
00:34:42,891 --> 00:34:48,144
Odd, seeing that her father died here.
- Gottfried died here?

368
00:34:49,314 --> 00:34:53,902
He was drunk and fell into the lake.
They found him the next morning.

369
00:34:54,111 --> 00:34:56,486
Just down there.

370
00:34:59,992 --> 00:35:02,952
It happened the year before
Harriet disappeared.

371
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:06,206
Henrik said you were travelling.

372
00:35:06,415 --> 00:35:09,918
I had to come home
in order to hide Harriet's body.

373
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:15,925
We weren't allowed to be here
when we were kids. It was off-limits.

374
00:35:18,595 --> 00:35:20,221
Thanks.

375
00:35:22,224 --> 00:35:27,561
Dear Diary. It's fall now.
The weather's getting colder.

376
00:35:29,481 --> 00:35:31,816
Magda 30112.

377
00:35:32,567 --> 00:35:35,445
Sara 32016.

378
00:35:36,155 --> 00:35:39,324
BJ 32027.

379
00:35:40,369 --> 00:35:43,453
LJ 31208.

380
00:35:44,163 --> 00:35:47,457
Mari 32018.

381
00:35:47,541 --> 00:35:50,835
I don't understand
why Henrik hired you.

382
00:35:52,213 --> 00:35:55,048
To be honest, neither do I.

383
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:58,970
With all respect,
there's nothing to find.

384
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:01,264
It's been nearly 40 years.

385
00:36:01,473 --> 00:36:04,558
You found Harriet's diary
in her dad's cottage.

386
00:36:04,643 --> 00:36:10,022
The diary didn't help us one bit.
- What about the phone numbers?

387
00:36:10,232 --> 00:36:14,026
They were a complete mystery to us.
- But 32 is...

388
00:36:14,236 --> 00:36:18,115
32 could be Hedestad.
30 is Norrbyn's area code.

389
00:36:18,366 --> 00:36:21,493
But the names
and the numbers don't match.

390
00:36:21,577 --> 00:36:25,581
Did you call them up?
- We did. We even tried backwards.

391
00:36:25,666 --> 00:36:30,294
We switched them, removed numbers.
We tried everything.

392
00:36:30,503 --> 00:36:35,590
In the report, she's described as
withdrawn and religiously inclined.

393
00:36:35,717 --> 00:36:38,052
Was that your impression?

394
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:42,057
Who isn't withdrawn at that age?

395
00:36:42,267 --> 00:36:48,271
But, yes. She kept to herself.
Anita, her cousin, knew her the best.

396
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,151
Anita is Cecilia Vanger's sister.
And Anita is dead.

397
00:36:52,694 --> 00:36:55,153
She died many years ago.

398
00:36:57,157 --> 00:36:59,993
Harriet was my first case.

399
00:37:00,161 --> 00:37:03,746
I've thought about it
every day for nearly 40 years now.

400
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:09,002
I'm retiring this summer. It's only
now that I'm able to let it go.

401
00:37:10,629 --> 00:37:13,130
There is no answer.

402
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:17,635
You'll only breathe life into
Henrik's obsession.

403
00:37:20,014 --> 00:37:23,517
Give it up before you become
obsessed yourself.

404
00:38:56,282 --> 00:38:58,284
What are you working on?

405
00:39:26,022 --> 00:39:30,317
Who's this week's victim?
- Nobody.

406
00:39:36,616 --> 00:39:40,786
Still that reporter?
I thought you were done with him.

407
00:39:42,039 --> 00:39:44,248
Why do you keep at it?

408
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,792
It's a bit slow.

409
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:55,176
A new computer?

410
00:39:55,344 --> 00:40:00,807
Yes, I need 20,000.
- Why do you need a 20,000 kroner PC?

411
00:40:01,809 --> 00:40:06,188
So I can play, surf the internet.
- You often surf the internet?

412
00:40:08,274 --> 00:40:10,067
Do you chat?

413
00:40:20,246 --> 00:40:22,538
Know what, Lisbeth?

414
00:40:24,833 --> 00:40:27,835
I can't just hand you 20,000.

415
00:40:29,505 --> 00:40:32,507
Not just like that.
- How hard can it be?

416
00:40:32,716 --> 00:40:35,511
Why can't I
look after my own money?

417
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:40,349
Hit me. Come on.

418
00:40:41,226 --> 00:40:43,936
That's what you want, isn't it?
Hit me.

419
00:40:44,938 --> 00:40:48,857
If you give me any kind of trouble,
I'll make sure -

420
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:52,695
you spend the rest
of your life in a closed ward.

421
00:40:52,862 --> 00:40:57,284
I know all about your mental problems
and your violent background.

422
00:41:01,872 --> 00:41:04,332
Don't get me wrong, Lisbeth...

423
00:41:07,253 --> 00:41:10,171
I'm more than happy
to give you the 20,000.

424
00:41:11,799 --> 00:41:15,844
But, you know,
any business transaction

425
00:41:17,806 --> 00:41:21,517
is built on trust.
I have to feel that I can trust you.

426
00:41:23,438 --> 00:41:25,605
Can I trust you, baby?

427
00:41:28,942 --> 00:41:30,901
Can I trust you, Lisbeth?

428
00:41:48,297 --> 00:41:50,590
Can I trust you?

429
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:07,941
If you're nice to me...

430
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:13,864
If you're nice to me,
I'll always be nice to you.

431
00:42:57,869 --> 00:43:01,539
It's only 7,000.
- More than enough for a computer.

432
00:43:22,395 --> 00:43:24,396
What are you looking at?

433
00:44:02,771 --> 00:44:07,525
You said it was a photographer
from the paper that shot the parade.

434
00:44:07,735 --> 00:44:11,070
Yes, he covered both the parade
and the accident.

435
00:44:11,155 --> 00:44:14,700
The old part of the archive
is a jumble.

436
00:44:14,910 --> 00:44:20,914
We haven't digitized it.
It's still kept in negative folders.

437
00:44:21,081 --> 00:44:23,793
20... 30...

438
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:28,213
...40, 50, 60...

439
00:44:28,464 --> 00:44:32,052
A photographer uses
between two and ten rolls a day.

440
00:44:32,094 --> 00:44:35,304
Probably closer to ten
on Children's Day.

441
00:44:35,514 --> 00:44:38,140
Here. September 1966.

442
00:44:38,350 --> 00:44:41,603
I only need the hour
of the parade.

443
00:44:41,813 --> 00:44:44,897
Knock yourself out.
- They're not sorted?

444
00:44:45,065 --> 00:44:48,735
If you're lucky,
they might be chronological.

445
00:44:48,945 --> 00:44:52,948
You don't happen to have
a negative scanner and a light table?

446
00:46:43,857 --> 00:46:47,234
This is the first lead in the case
in 39 years.

447
00:46:47,361 --> 00:46:49,236
It's a start.

448
00:46:52,366 --> 00:46:54,325
It's much more than that.

449
00:46:56,203 --> 00:46:57,704
Look.

450
00:46:59,165 --> 00:47:01,124
Do you see what I see?

451
00:47:02,669 --> 00:47:06,506
What is she looking at?
What is she afraid of?

452
00:47:08,091 --> 00:47:09,800
Her murderer.

453
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:13,805
He was somewhere here.

454
00:47:14,056 --> 00:47:19,685
Right across the road.
There's Harriet’s murderer.

455
00:47:38,288 --> 00:47:41,993
Mikael, coffee?
- So, what did you find?

456
00:47:41,994 --> 00:47:43,594
Anything interesting?

457
00:47:43,636 --> 00:47:46,714
Well, I still have to read...

458
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:52,302
several thousand pages people have been
studying for the past 40 years.

459
00:47:53,304 --> 00:47:54,967
And to be frank,

460
00:47:57,237 --> 00:48:02,254
I... found a lot
of nothing.

461
00:48:05,885 --> 00:48:07,685
Correct me if I'm wrong
but...

462
00:48:07,686 --> 00:48:10,447
shouldn't you be in Stockholm
preparing for your appeal?

463
00:48:10,598 --> 00:48:11,517
Tia.

464
00:48:11,518 --> 00:48:13,818
You don't
- Look...

465
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:16,114
Mikael is an adult,

466
00:48:16,115 --> 00:48:18,615
He's perfectly capable...
- I was set up.

467
00:48:20,632 --> 00:48:25,338
An old pal and class-mate of mine gave me
a tip concerning Wennerström's company.

468
00:48:25,465 --> 00:48:29,934
It was a good story, I had everything
I needed, to bring him down.

469
00:48:30,002 --> 00:48:32,220
Or so you thought, right?

470
00:48:32,246 --> 00:48:35,432
Right, because not long after
I got a better story...

471
00:48:35,441 --> 00:48:40,136
about embezzling and arms-trafficking
worth about 60 million kroner.

472
00:48:40,730 --> 00:48:45,858
Wennerström's name was all over it.
So far, so good, but...

473
00:48:46,611 --> 00:48:50,682
then I published the story.
My sources disappeared.

474
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:55,494
And all my documents and facts
I've gathered turned out to be forgeries.

475
00:48:55,745 --> 00:48:57,055
They're all fake?

476
00:48:57,064 --> 00:49:01,617
So all this, was just a manoeuvre
to lure you away from the real story?

477
00:49:01,627 --> 00:49:04,211
It was too good to be true, yeah.

478
00:49:06,098 --> 00:49:10,052
Speaking of unbelievable,
I have a little something for you.

479
00:49:15,683 --> 00:49:19,994
A single malt.
21 years old.

480
00:49:22,097 --> 00:49:25,400
To hell with the past,
let's drink to the present. Skoal.

481
00:49:25,527 --> 00:49:28,170
Skoal.
- Skoal.

482
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:37,171
Wow!

483
00:49:48,426 --> 00:49:50,678
What would you say to a
nice glass of wine?

484
00:49:56,310 --> 00:49:58,186
I think I've had enough for one night.

485
00:49:58,787 --> 00:50:00,187
You know?
- Okay.

486
00:50:02,315 --> 00:50:06,069
Thanks for a fun night.
- Is it because of the investigation?

487
00:50:06,279 --> 00:50:09,071
Or is it because of my sordid family?

488
00:50:09,281 --> 00:50:13,494
Why do you say that?
- Because I could be the one, right?

489
00:50:13,704 --> 00:50:18,555
I'm not sure to be
on your list of... suspects, hm?

490
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:45,484
Bjurman.
- It's Lisbeth.

491
00:50:45,611 --> 00:50:48,614
What do you want?
- I need more money.

492
00:50:49,515 --> 00:50:50,515
I see.

493
00:50:50,867 --> 00:50:53,784
We'll have to discuss it.
- Yeah, but I need it now.

494
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:03,504
Hi, welcome.

495
00:51:07,301 --> 00:51:08,836
Take off your jacket.

496
00:51:12,915 --> 00:51:17,811
I just want my money.
- And I might give you your money.

497
00:51:17,821 --> 00:51:20,848
Thanks for last time by the way. I hope
you enjoyed it as much as I did.

498
00:51:20,849 --> 00:51:23,727
I'm not giving you a blow-job
every time I need money.

499
00:51:24,628 --> 00:51:25,828
You're not?

500
00:51:26,937 --> 00:51:28,947
What will you do?

501
00:51:29,925 --> 00:51:32,170
Do you want me to call
the probate department...

502
00:51:32,171 --> 00:51:33,871
and tell them
you're trespassing...

503
00:51:33,937 --> 00:51:38,274
and threatening me, hm?
Is that really what you want?

504
00:51:38,334 --> 00:51:42,221
You'll be back in psych-ward so fast,
that'll make your head spin.

505
00:51:51,682 --> 00:51:52,923
Well then?

506
00:51:56,235 --> 00:51:57,435
Hm?

507
00:52:28,136 --> 00:52:30,095
Well, that's much better.

508
00:52:31,696 --> 00:52:33,396
It'll be fun, you'll see.

509
00:52:34,642 --> 00:52:36,560
Very nice.

510
00:52:37,645 --> 00:52:39,272
Come here.

511
00:52:41,650 --> 00:52:43,067
Come here.

512
00:53:03,217 --> 00:53:04,385
No!

513
00:53:05,586 --> 00:53:08,386
No!
Please!

514
00:54:04,392 --> 00:54:06,538
I'm gonna teach you
rule number one:

515
00:54:06,747 --> 00:54:08,450
Don't resist...

516
00:54:09,559 --> 00:54:12,869
If you're nice...
then I'll let you go.

517
00:56:06,459 --> 00:56:08,269
I'm gonna teach you
rule number one:

518
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:09,970
Don't resist...

519
00:56:11,271 --> 00:56:14,471
If you're nice...
then I'll let you go.

520
00:58:04,991 --> 00:58:12,706
NORSJÃ– CARPENTERS

521
00:58:42,404 --> 00:58:46,733
My husband died many years ago.
So it's just me now.

522
00:58:48,245 --> 00:58:51,955
He was a carpenter
at a wood-shop for 24 years.

523
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:57,002
They made everything
from clothes pegs to closets.

524
00:58:57,345 --> 00:59:01,847
He built that cabinet there,
and the lamp, of course.

525
00:59:05,053 --> 00:59:06,747
Would you like more cake?

526
00:59:06,814 --> 00:59:12,184
I need to ask you, do you remember
being in Hedestad in September 1966?

527
00:59:12,193 --> 00:59:13,570
Hedestad...

528
00:59:13,980 --> 00:59:16,306
'66?
- '66.

529
00:59:21,863 --> 00:59:24,200
Well, of course
that's where we went on our honeymoon.

530
00:59:24,201 --> 00:59:27,007
Wonderful, and uh...
did you take any pictures then?

531
00:59:27,008 --> 00:59:30,079
Went camping.
It was all rage back then.

532
00:59:31,540 --> 00:59:35,526
It was with out a doubt,
the best holiday we ever had.

533
00:59:36,043 --> 00:59:38,755
Like most honeymoons
I imagine.

534
00:59:38,964 --> 00:59:43,868
Well then, you must have pictures?
- Oh, of course I have pictures.

535
00:59:45,094 --> 00:59:49,016
You know many people that don't
have pictures of their honeymoon?

536
00:59:51,728 --> 00:59:55,104
The first day,
we went hiking in the mountains.

537
00:59:55,315 --> 01:00:00,319
My husband, he liked the mountain.
We went on quiet a trip.

538
01:00:00,528 --> 01:00:03,738
He wasn't exactly romantic sort of.

539
01:00:04,908 --> 01:00:06,492
Now, let's see.

540
01:00:07,786 --> 01:00:09,787
Hedestad...

541
01:00:11,823 --> 01:00:16,127
Oh, look at that.
So lovely.

542
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:19,349
All these photos
don't do the sunset justice.

543
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:21,350
Look at this.

544
01:00:21,433 --> 01:00:22,934
Oh, here's something.

545
01:00:24,428 --> 01:00:27,680
There was a parade that day.

546
01:00:47,161 --> 01:00:50,663
What're you doing here?
I'm on my way out.

547
01:00:51,172 --> 01:00:52,928
You still don't know the rules,
do you?

548
01:00:53,229 --> 01:00:55,729
You have to make an appointment,
before coming.

549
01:00:56,463 --> 01:00:58,088
You hear what I said?

550
01:01:33,208 --> 01:01:34,834
Untie me this minute.

551
01:01:38,048 --> 01:01:40,216
I said untie me!

552
01:01:41,468 --> 01:01:44,011
You don't like being tied up?

553
01:01:46,306 --> 01:01:48,302
Or do you prefer
tying up others?

554
01:01:48,803 --> 01:01:50,703
You like

555
01:02:10,497 --> 01:02:12,249
This is nice.

556
01:02:12,918 --> 01:02:17,062
Did you try it?
I think you're going to love it.

557
01:02:17,797 --> 01:02:19,757
Looks great to me.

558
01:02:45,743 --> 01:02:49,506
Ever seen that show where politicians
get busted doing illegal shit...

559
01:02:49,507 --> 01:02:50,807
in front of candid cameras?

560
01:02:50,916 --> 01:02:53,292
We have those cameras
at security.

561
01:02:53,335 --> 01:02:56,545
I had one in my bag
last time I was here.

562
01:02:56,755 --> 01:02:59,090
Welcome.

563
01:03:01,301 --> 01:03:04,304
I just thought you'd make me
give you another blow-job.

564
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:06,807
You're even sicker
than I thought.

565
01:03:07,276 --> 01:03:08,962
The show goes on for 2 hours.

566
01:03:08,963 --> 01:03:12,863
So you have plenty of time to imagine what
the cops and the press gonna think about it.

567
01:03:13,356 --> 01:03:15,148
Have fun.

568
01:03:15,316 --> 01:03:18,944
Thanks for last time by the way. I hope
you enjoyed it as much as I did.

569
01:03:18,953 --> 01:03:22,364
I'm not giving you a blow-job
every time I need money.

570
01:03:22,573 --> 01:03:26,560
You're not?
What will you do?

571
01:04:03,199 --> 01:04:07,078
Let me explain what happens now.
Just listen and nod your head, okay?

572
01:04:08,881 --> 01:04:13,252
From now on, I manage my own money.
You'll have no access.

573
01:04:14,337 --> 01:04:16,838
I spend my money the way I want.

574
01:04:20,384 --> 01:04:22,386
You got that?

575
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:26,931
Every month you write in your report
that my behaviour is perfect.

576
01:04:27,768 --> 01:04:29,936
Better and making good progress.

577
01:04:30,188 --> 01:04:35,691
In exactly 1 year, you'll submit an
application to terminate my Guardianship.

578
01:04:35,901 --> 01:04:38,236
I'll mail you further instructions.

579
01:04:40,823 --> 01:04:42,948
You will never contact me again.

580
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:46,038
The minute you'll break the rules
I'll get that sent to the police...

581
01:04:46,039 --> 01:04:47,939
and every television station
in the country.

582
01:04:48,916 --> 01:04:51,750
The same thing happens if I get sick,
or if I'm in an accident...

583
01:04:51,818 --> 01:04:54,879
or if you don't follow
my instructions to the letter.

584
01:04:56,131 --> 01:04:59,350
You got that?
Good.

585
01:05:12,015 --> 01:05:16,235
I've never done this before, so don't move
around to much, or it wont be nice.

586
01:05:22,450 --> 01:05:24,284
Lay still.

587
01:06:02,534 --> 01:06:06,996
I'M A SADIST PIG
AND A RAPIST

588
01:06:36,528 --> 01:06:40,990
during the last year...

589
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:45,411
an avid interest in religion.

590
01:07:50,314 --> 01:07:52,065
Send.

591
01:08:00,116 --> 01:08:03,988
The guy in the blue sweater.
I can't get it any sharper then that.

592
01:08:05,497 --> 01:08:07,641
That's the best I can do,
Mikael.

593
01:08:07,642 --> 01:08:09,542
It's just way too blurry.

594
01:08:09,710 --> 01:08:11,529
Are you sure,
there's nothing else you can try?

595
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:14,030
Positive.
I've tried everything, sorry.

596
01:08:14,055 --> 01:08:16,632
Alright, thanks anyway.
bye-bye.

597
01:08:28,645 --> 01:08:31,848
Wasp...
Harriet's phone numbers.

598
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:46,206
Read it and weep, Kalle Blomkvist...

599
01:09:14,069 --> 01:09:16,820
"If a woman
approaches any beast"...

600
01:09:17,072 --> 01:09:20,408
"We shall kill the woman
and the beast, -

601
01:09:20,618 --> 01:09:22,576
"We shall kill the woman
and the beast".

602
01:09:22,702 --> 01:09:25,662
"They shall be put to dead
their blood is upon them".

603
01:09:25,705 --> 01:09:28,708
Mari 32018.

604
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:33,088
Magda 30112.

605
01:09:33,255 --> 01:09:35,733
Leviticus,
Chapter 20, Verse 27.

606
01:09:35,817 --> 01:09:38,996
"she shall take two turtle-doves
or two young pigeons,

607
01:09:39,363 --> 01:09:42,631
one for a burnt offering
and the other for a sin offering".

608
01:09:42,632 --> 01:09:45,332
Leviticus,
Chapter 20, Verse 25.

609
01:09:45,810 --> 01:09:46,930
"A man or a woman...

610
01:09:46,973 --> 01:09:49,533
"who is a medium
or spirit just among you...

611
01:09:49,576 --> 01:09:55,821
must be put to death.
You must stone them".

612
01:09:59,241 --> 01:10:01,534
They must be put to death.

613
01:10:15,558 --> 01:10:17,217
Frode! What's going on?

614
01:10:17,427 --> 01:10:19,771
It's Henrik.
He just collapsed.

615
01:10:21,432 --> 01:10:24,392
We'll keep you informed.
- Thank you.

616
01:10:32,402 --> 01:10:35,978
It's a heart attack.
He has to have emergency surgery.

617
01:10:37,156 --> 01:10:39,241
What are his odds?

618
01:10:39,451 --> 01:10:42,286
They're talking about a bypass
so it's serious.

619
01:10:46,583 --> 01:10:48,333
You want coffee?
- No.

620
01:10:54,215 --> 01:10:57,302
I think you should still continue
with your investigation.

621
01:10:57,511 --> 01:11:00,889
You hired somebody else to help me out?
- No, you're the only one we hired.

622
01:11:01,098 --> 01:11:05,518
Then someone has hacked
into my computer, someone called Wasp.

623
01:11:06,437 --> 01:11:11,106
Sent me an e-mail with copies
of one of my own private documents.

624
01:11:12,526 --> 01:11:15,946
That means this person must have
gained access to my hard drive.

625
01:11:19,242 --> 01:11:22,036
Do you know anything about this?

626
01:11:26,833 --> 01:11:28,834
Well...

627
01:11:28,877 --> 01:11:32,338
Now, that I come
to think of it, um...

628
01:11:32,547 --> 01:11:35,342
I might have an idea,
who's behind it.

629
01:12:02,479 --> 01:12:03,881
Just stay here.

630
01:12:08,835 --> 01:12:11,212
Lisbeth Salander?

631
01:12:11,322 --> 01:12:12,215
Do I know you?

632
01:12:12,216 --> 01:12:14,516
You know exactly who I am, let me in.
- No.

633
01:12:19,722 --> 01:12:22,967
I've read your report.
Interesting stuff.

634
01:12:23,018 --> 01:12:26,388
But not as intriguing
how you stole my files.

635
01:12:27,089 --> 01:12:29,488
I'm sure the police
would be very interested...

636
01:12:29,489 --> 01:12:31,089
to know how you managed to...

637
01:12:31,098 --> 01:12:33,751
hack illegally into my computer.

638
01:12:41,203 --> 01:12:44,622
Remove those papers,
I'll take off the chain.

639
01:12:56,052 --> 01:12:57,803
What do you want?

640
01:13:01,166 --> 01:13:03,211
Hi.
- You're okay?

641
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,312
I'm fine.

642
01:13:12,770 --> 01:13:16,031
I said, what do you want?
- Got any coffee?

643
01:13:40,082 --> 01:13:42,392
How much do you know
about my assignment?

644
01:13:42,701 --> 01:13:45,812
A 16-year-old girl
was murdered 40 years ago.

645
01:13:48,283 --> 01:13:51,518
Until today I wasn't convinced
she was murdered.

646
01:13:51,903 --> 01:13:54,338
But then you pointed out to me
the passages in the Bible...

647
01:13:54,348 --> 01:13:57,216
that speak of women
who should be killed.

648
01:13:58,126 --> 01:13:59,038
And?

649
01:14:00,039 --> 01:14:02,739
So far, it's the most important clue
in the case.

650
01:14:06,277 --> 01:14:09,671
And?
- Well, I... well, I need your help.

651
01:14:11,965 --> 01:14:15,101
I'll be well paid.
- I already have a job.

652
01:14:15,111 --> 01:14:18,746
Lisbeth, you're a professional hacker,
a very talented one...

653
01:14:18,747 --> 01:14:21,350
but one who sends e-mails
that are easily traced.

654
01:14:21,651 --> 01:14:23,051
I don't understand?

655
01:14:26,231 --> 01:14:27,856
Why is that?

656
01:14:33,230 --> 01:14:34,472
Huh?

657
01:15:10,727 --> 01:15:12,480
So he'll live then?

658
01:15:17,834 --> 01:15:19,703
Can I come and visit him?

659
01:15:22,623 --> 01:15:24,999
Lisbeth Salander is here.

660
01:15:32,050 --> 01:15:35,385
I'll speak to you soon, Frode.
Thanks, bye.

661
01:15:52,321 --> 01:15:55,032
If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations...

662
01:15:57,035 --> 01:16:00,953
I assume you're familiar with the files so
I don't have to fill you in about anything?

663
01:16:02,014 --> 01:16:04,357
Yeah?
- Hm, right.

664
01:16:07,154 --> 01:16:12,382
Hey... What if these quotes
have nothing to do with God?

665
01:16:12,892 --> 01:16:15,178
What if it's a code?

666
01:16:15,387 --> 01:16:18,772
"A young girl Sara Witt was found murdered
in her family barn"...

667
01:16:18,798 --> 01:16:21,693
"just outside Vilhelmina in 1962".

668
01:16:22,094 --> 01:16:23,771
Sara? What else does it say?

669
01:16:24,839 --> 01:16:28,908
"Between 2 and 3 o'clock in the morning
the victim was lured into, uh"...

670
01:16:31,487 --> 01:16:34,482
"The body of the young girl
worn marks of mutilation",

671
01:16:34,483 --> 01:16:36,583
"probably from a religious ritual".

672
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:39,036
"The police refused to disclose
any more details".

673
01:16:39,246 --> 01:16:43,541
Mutilated, possibly religious...
They find the murderer?

674
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:48,730
No. The police must have
given up.

675
01:16:52,784 --> 01:16:56,012
It's a bid of a long-shot.
- Worth a shot.

676
01:16:57,014 --> 01:17:01,393
How far is Vilhelmina?
- If you go by car not far.

677
01:17:20,739 --> 01:17:22,232
What you waiting for?

678
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:26,043
Would you like to drive?
- What for?

679
01:17:27,546 --> 01:17:29,658
I haven't really driven
since I got divorced.

680
01:17:29,659 --> 01:17:31,959
Then it's about fucking time you did.

681
01:17:53,072 --> 01:17:55,984
If you type a woman’s name
you go right to a porn site.

682
01:17:56,093 --> 01:17:58,201
What're you looking for?

683
01:17:59,913 --> 01:18:04,084
I'm searching all the newspaper
and magazine databases.

684
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:51,132
Okay, come on.
Let's go to the barn.

685
01:18:54,637 --> 01:18:57,264
The family couldn't sell the farm
after what happened.

686
01:18:58,116 --> 01:19:00,350
It's been abandoned ever since.

687
01:19:04,691 --> 01:19:06,058
She was found here?

688
01:19:06,468 --> 01:19:11,780
Yes. Her poor husband found her.
It was horrible for him. Horrible.

689
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:16,159
She was there.

690
01:19:19,314 --> 01:19:20,606
In this stable.

691
01:19:21,416 --> 01:19:24,710
She was bound...
and tortured.

692
01:19:34,230 --> 01:19:36,398
Any of the animals harmed?

693
01:19:37,742 --> 01:19:39,593
How did you know that?

694
01:19:43,155 --> 01:19:45,815
"If a woman approaches any beast
and lies with it,

695
01:19:45,816 --> 01:19:48,486
you should kill the woman
and the beast".

696
01:19:52,491 --> 01:19:55,259
It could simply be a coincidence.
- Yes.

697
01:20:00,206 --> 01:20:02,667
Oh, fuck, Lisbeth.

698
01:20:04,836 --> 01:20:06,954
It's the same with the others...

699
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:17,098
I've found an old TV program.

700
01:20:19,519 --> 01:20:22,888
A report from 1999
about a murder in Dalarna.

701
01:20:23,130 --> 01:20:24,081
Go on.

702
01:20:24,082 --> 01:20:28,360
" From a series murders in Sweden comes
the case of Magda Lovisa Sjöberg...

703
01:20:28,612 --> 01:20:30,238
from Dalarna".

704
01:20:31,615 --> 01:20:33,449
Magda...

705
01:20:33,658 --> 01:20:38,038
"A brutal murder that left police
baffled in November 1954".

706
01:20:38,206 --> 01:20:40,623
And, uh...
what was Magda reference?

707
01:20:40,791 --> 01:20:43,701
Leviticus,
Chapter 1, Verse 12.

708
01:20:43,710 --> 01:20:46,397
"He's to cut it into pieces...
including the head and the fat"...

709
01:20:46,448 --> 01:20:49,975
"and the priest shall arrange them...
on the burning wood on the altar".

710
01:20:51,861 --> 01:20:53,863
That was verbatim.

711
01:20:56,709 --> 01:20:58,767
You quoted it to the letter.

712
01:21:12,809 --> 01:21:17,737
According to the report, Magda's body
was only found 6 hours after she was killed.

713
01:21:18,747 --> 01:21:20,916
A farmer spotted smoke
from the fire.

714
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:24,752
He thought it was just
a bunch of kids having fun.

715
01:21:26,188 --> 01:21:29,141
Fat's cut from the body,
is that mentioned in your report?

716
01:21:32,137 --> 01:21:34,734
Yes, yes. It's right here,
it says, uh...

717
01:21:34,735 --> 01:21:37,835
fat was found along
with the remains of the head.

718
01:21:39,211 --> 01:21:40,754
Revolting.

719
01:22:21,814 --> 01:22:24,357
What the hell?
Hey, calm down!

720
01:22:25,401 --> 01:22:28,103
I just wanted to wake you up.
We're here.

721
01:22:30,704 --> 01:22:32,404
What the fuck.

722
01:22:43,954 --> 01:22:45,005
Can I come in?

723
01:22:49,368 --> 01:22:51,185
Here, here's your bag.

724
01:22:57,993 --> 01:22:59,262
You're okay?

725
01:23:01,456 --> 01:23:02,691
Yeah, I'm okay.

726
01:23:38,436 --> 01:23:40,837
I can't find anyone
with the initials BJ.

727
01:23:43,066 --> 01:23:46,278
But LI could be Liv Ingvartsson.

728
01:23:46,445 --> 01:23:50,739
A prostitute who disappeared in Ãnge and
was found on this building site in a dump.

729
01:23:50,949 --> 01:23:52,700
What was that quote again?

730
01:23:52,909 --> 01:23:55,312
"She is to bring two turtle-doves
or two young pigeons,

731
01:23:55,313 --> 01:23:57,455
one for a burnt offering
and one for a sin offering".

732
01:23:57,581 --> 01:24:00,249
"The priest will make atonement
for her, and she shall be clean".

733
01:24:00,559 --> 01:24:04,880
Ãnge... That's quite a ways
in the opposite direction.

734
01:24:13,015 --> 01:24:17,100
I think I've found another one.
A 17-year-old from Uppsala.

735
01:24:17,310 --> 01:24:20,354
When?
- 1964.

736
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:22,617
"The Mari murder
leaves our streets deserted".

737
01:24:22,918 --> 01:24:25,218
Uh...
"Mari Killer is still on the loose".

738
01:24:27,387 --> 01:24:28,481
There.

739
01:24:31,392 --> 01:24:35,911
So, we've got Sara, Mari,
Magda and Liv. Four murders.

740
01:24:36,122 --> 01:24:39,374
That just leaves BJ,
the one heavy in circles.

741
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:41,185
Harriet couldn't have known them...

742
01:24:41,194 --> 01:24:46,700
because Liv was murdered in 1949.
and Harriet was born in 1950.

743
01:24:46,701 --> 01:24:48,001
So, what's the connection?

744
01:24:48,753 --> 01:24:52,254
She made a list of women who had been
killed and then she disappeared.

745
01:24:52,305 --> 01:24:54,766
Harriet must've known
who the killer was.

746
01:24:55,067 --> 01:24:56,167
Yeah.

747
01:25:12,803 --> 01:25:14,120
What is it?

748
01:25:15,530 --> 01:25:17,248
Someone's been here.

749
01:25:21,044 --> 01:25:25,547
The photos have been rearranged.
And the Bible's been moved.

750
01:25:28,251 --> 01:25:31,388
See, there.
- What the hell?

751
01:25:32,131 --> 01:25:34,633
Somebody really wanted to get in here.

752
01:25:45,187 --> 01:25:47,012
I'll change the locks tomorrow.

753
01:26:00,877 --> 01:26:01,955
Lisbeth...
- Hm?

754
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:04,156
do you have a photographic memory?

755
01:26:21,492 --> 01:26:23,918
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

756
01:26:24,427 --> 01:26:28,482
If you got a photographic memory,
that's fantastic, I wish I had one.

757
01:26:56,987 --> 01:26:59,346
Damn, you scared the shit outta me.

758
01:27:01,024 --> 01:27:02,650
What is it?

759
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:09,600
What're you doing?

760
01:27:28,270 --> 01:27:30,279
Are you sure this is a good idea?

761
01:28:23,036 --> 01:28:25,779
Are you going?
- Good night.

762
01:28:46,919 --> 01:28:49,070
Good morning.
- Good morning.

763
01:29:12,247 --> 01:29:13,805
You sleep well?

764
01:29:15,106 --> 01:29:16,206
Hm-hm.

765
01:29:28,397 --> 01:29:32,607
I want to see Henrik. Wanna come?
- I hate hospitals.

766
01:29:38,240 --> 01:29:42,016
This is...
it's unbelievable.

767
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:46,199
You've found out more
than I'd hoped possible.

768
01:29:48,735 --> 01:29:51,227
Concentrate on getting well.

769
01:29:53,656 --> 01:29:55,200
I'll keep you posted.

770
01:29:56,409 --> 01:29:58,559
In regards to the last reference...

771
01:29:58,911 --> 01:30:01,295
The mystery name.
- BJ.

772
01:30:01,406 --> 01:30:03,882
Talk to Morell,
he might be able to help you.

773
01:30:09,022 --> 01:30:11,391
Morell!
Morell!

774
01:30:14,853 --> 01:30:17,437
What in the name of God?
Five murders!

775
01:30:20,234 --> 01:30:21,651
So, they weren't phone numbers.

776
01:30:21,719 --> 01:30:25,171
No, if it's any consolation,
I didn't solve the code alone.

777
01:30:26,364 --> 01:30:29,368
But we've had no luck finding
the last woman with the initials BJ.

778
01:30:29,411 --> 01:30:34,248
Harriet circled as if it were more important
then the others. It's the last reference.

779
01:30:34,374 --> 01:30:39,478
If there's a woman with these initials
who was murdered in the 40's, 50's or 60's,

780
01:30:39,562 --> 01:30:44,758
we've got to find her.
You have any idea what this means?

781
01:30:45,385 --> 01:30:47,986
If the first murder
happened in 1949,

782
01:30:47,996 --> 01:30:51,349
then whoever's been sending those
flowers to Henrik would be a very old man.

783
01:30:51,392 --> 01:30:54,436
It reduces the number
of suspects considerably.

784
01:31:18,963 --> 01:31:22,582
Mikael. I'm glad you could make it.

785
01:31:22,583 --> 01:31:23,624
Welcome.
- Thank you.

786
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:26,427
Harald couldn't make it.
He's deer hunting.

787
01:31:26,428 --> 01:31:27,428
Oh...

788
01:31:30,640 --> 01:31:32,975
And to what do I owe this honour?

789
01:31:33,026 --> 01:31:36,272
Have you had a look
at the local paper recently?

790
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:38,040
I was out of town.

791
01:31:38,083 --> 01:31:41,503
Well, they started running
a series of articles...

792
01:31:41,546 --> 01:31:45,948
about your so called escapades
with a young girl in Hedeby.

793
01:31:46,158 --> 01:31:48,984
BLOMKVIST'S YOUNG NEW GIRLFRIEND

794
01:31:51,746 --> 01:31:54,207
Okay?
- This is precisely the kind of publicity...

795
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,608
we don't want here.
- Mh-hm.

796
01:31:55,752 --> 01:31:57,752
Henrik is dying.

797
01:31:57,961 --> 01:32:01,290
My private life has nothing to do
with my work for Henrik.

798
01:32:01,300 --> 01:32:05,885
On the contrary. It reflects poorly on us,
the Vanger Corporation.

799
01:32:05,894 --> 01:32:10,766
Have you not done enough already?
Will you be satisfied when Henrik is dead?

800
01:32:10,975 --> 01:32:13,560
Stop looking
into my daughter's death.

801
01:32:15,479 --> 01:32:17,534
It maybe time to consider
letting this go.

802
01:32:18,335 --> 01:32:19,435
What do you mean?

803
01:32:19,944 --> 01:32:23,487
You're making matters worse
coming here with your little whore...

804
01:32:23,530 --> 01:32:25,989
Mama, please calm down.

805
01:32:26,199 --> 01:32:31,137
But I do think it's time we let it pass.
It's been a difficult time for everyone.

806
01:32:33,414 --> 01:32:36,042
Henrik wants, uh...
- Mikael, my friend, listen...

807
01:32:36,293 --> 01:32:38,907
Excuse the interruption,
but if you'll permit me...

808
01:32:39,708 --> 01:32:42,308
Uh... Henrik and Mikael
have signed a contract.

809
01:32:43,968 --> 01:32:48,222
As long as Henrik's alive it is
binding and cannot be cancelled.

810
01:32:48,431 --> 01:32:53,727
Whether Mikael likes it or not,
he's obliged to continue.

811
01:33:07,743 --> 01:33:11,371
I really wish it didn't have to be
so overly dramatic.

812
01:33:11,539 --> 01:33:15,208
Isn't that Harriet's pendant?
- What're you talking about?

813
01:33:16,252 --> 01:33:19,963
Harriet was wearing it the day she
disappeared, and now you're wearing it.

814
01:33:20,172 --> 01:33:23,184
What're you saying?
Are you accusing me?

815
01:33:24,595 --> 01:33:27,096
I was just wondering,
how you came to own it.

816
01:33:27,347 --> 01:33:31,934
I inherited this pendant years ago.
I didn't get it Harriet.

817
01:33:36,673 --> 01:33:38,791
Anita, your sister?

818
01:33:47,752 --> 01:33:51,580
Micke...
Hey, Micke.

819
01:33:53,217 --> 01:33:54,784
Are you all right?

820
01:34:06,839 --> 01:34:10,425
Anita is Harriet.
I was wrong. It wasn't her.

821
01:34:10,435 --> 01:34:11,868
Wait, what're you talking about?

822
01:34:11,878 --> 01:34:16,272
They both looked after me that summer.
That pendant belonged Anita, not Harriet.

823
01:34:19,986 --> 01:34:24,730
You're right, that is Anita.
Shit, do they ever look alike.

824
01:34:25,241 --> 01:34:29,245
What we have on Anita right now?
- Uh... Harriet's cousin and best friend.

825
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:33,165
They spend every summer together.
She had no alibi, but was never a suspect.

826
01:34:33,416 --> 01:34:36,628
Right after Harriet's death,
she moved to London to study.

827
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,040
She had a brilliant career,
but died of breast cancer...

828
01:34:39,141 --> 01:34:41,041
when she was
a 37 year old woman.

829
01:34:41,433 --> 01:34:43,025
So, she died 20 years ago.

830
01:34:44,595 --> 01:34:47,006
Without ever telling Morell
she was the one in the window.

831
01:34:47,016 --> 01:34:50,743
What was she hiding?
- Maybe she was protecting the killer.

832
01:34:50,844 --> 01:34:51,844
Yeah.

833
01:35:01,471 --> 01:35:06,149
Plague. I need help.
Can you run a check on Anita Vanger?

834
01:35:10,123 --> 01:35:11,025
Plague?

835
01:35:11,026 --> 01:35:13,226
If there's something to find,
he'll find it.

836
01:36:50,794 --> 01:36:54,371
What the hell happened?
- Some asshole shot at me.

837
01:36:55,675 --> 01:36:57,836
And you never saw who it was?
- No.

838
01:37:03,866 --> 01:37:07,752
It must mean we're getting pretty close.
And someone out there doesn't like it.

839
01:37:07,762 --> 01:37:10,414
Give me my phone,
so I can call the police.

840
01:37:10,624 --> 01:37:13,116
What are they gonna do about it?
- Give me my phone, please.

841
01:37:13,167 --> 01:37:15,293
Then I'm outta here.
- Lisbeth...

842
01:37:22,803 --> 01:37:25,155
Let's not jump
to any conclusions, Mikael.

843
01:37:25,156 --> 01:37:26,156
What do you mean?

844
01:37:26,265 --> 01:37:28,934
It could've be a hunting accident.
- No way.

845
01:37:29,085 --> 01:37:32,520
If it wasn't a hunting accident,
then you're not safe here.

846
01:37:34,022 --> 01:37:37,819
You should go back to Stockholm.
At least for a while.

847
01:37:38,863 --> 01:37:42,197
Ever since I got here,
everyone's been telling me to go home.

848
01:37:44,827 --> 01:37:47,704
What about you,
anything new on BJ?

849
01:37:47,830 --> 01:37:53,134
I've looked, Mikael, but there's no BJ
in the system. But I will keep looking.

850
01:37:53,711 --> 01:37:56,054
I've got 2 cameras outside
and 4 in here...

851
01:37:56,063 --> 01:37:59,549
connected to motion detectors.
I've got the cottage covered.

852
01:38:02,679 --> 01:38:04,322
Fantastic.

853
01:38:14,007 --> 01:38:15,533
I guess you're not going home?

854
01:38:19,863 --> 01:38:21,781
Not now.
I'm staying.

855
01:38:31,834 --> 01:38:33,876
So now we've got it on film?

856
01:38:36,547 --> 01:38:39,674
Yep.
It's on the internet.

857
01:38:56,902 --> 01:38:58,986
What're you doing?
- What?

858
01:38:59,196 --> 01:39:02,783
Go sleep in your own bed.
- I wanna be close to you.

859
01:39:06,204 --> 01:39:08,455
Okay, but you better just sleep.

860
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:23,637
What happened to you?
How did you become this way?

861
01:39:28,060 --> 01:39:33,039
You know all about me.
But I don't know anything about you.

862
01:39:34,943 --> 01:39:36,901
Nothing at all.

863
01:39:38,662 --> 01:39:40,347
Yeah, get used to it.

864
01:40:18,313 --> 01:40:20,990
Who is it?
- It's Morell.

865
01:40:24,535 --> 01:40:26,996
I found the last one.

866
01:40:27,205 --> 01:40:30,916
Rebecka Jacobsson,
nickname Becka.

867
01:40:32,044 --> 01:40:33,377
BJ.

868
01:40:34,964 --> 01:40:37,883
That's why we never found her.

869
01:40:38,426 --> 01:40:43,012
"A man or a woman who is a medium
or a spiritualist among you"...

870
01:40:43,055 --> 01:40:46,433
"must be put to death.
You are to stone them".

871
01:40:49,436 --> 01:40:50,880
It's her.

872
01:40:52,266 --> 01:40:55,276
Where was she killed?
- In Karlstad.

873
01:40:55,486 --> 01:40:57,303
But that's not the interesting part.

874
01:40:57,429 --> 01:41:03,409
Rebecka was employed by the Vanger Corp.
until her death in January 1965.

875
01:41:04,495 --> 01:41:07,829
She was secretary for Gottfried Vanger.

876
01:41:07,997 --> 01:41:11,167
Gottfried died before Harriet disappeared.
It couldn't be him.

877
01:41:11,219 --> 01:41:15,838
True. But we have to find out if she knew
any other members of the Vanger family.

878
01:41:19,719 --> 01:41:21,929
Hold on, hold on.
- What?

879
01:41:22,055 --> 01:41:24,556
Rebecka and Sara are Jewish names.

880
01:41:24,766 --> 01:41:26,517
Magda...
- Magdalena.

881
01:41:28,436 --> 01:41:31,163
Mari, Maria. But Liv?

882
01:41:32,464 --> 01:41:33,864
Liv?

883
01:41:35,277 --> 01:41:39,739
Eva means Liv. I'm pretty sure that
Liv Ingvartsson was Jewish.

884
01:41:39,949 --> 01:41:44,285
Racist crimes. It fits with
the pseudo religious rituals.

885
01:41:46,330 --> 01:41:48,790
But Harriet, though?

886
01:41:48,999 --> 01:41:52,502
Harriet died because she
discovered a pattern.

887
01:41:52,511 --> 01:41:54,489
How the hell
could we have missed that?

888
01:41:55,173 --> 01:41:59,093
They're Jewish names. There were
three Nazis in the Vanger family.

889
01:41:59,136 --> 01:42:02,012
But only one was still alive
when Harriet died.

890
01:42:02,764 --> 01:42:04,223
Harald.

891
01:42:05,559 --> 01:42:09,187
Just happened to be hunting
when you were jogging in the woods.

892
01:42:17,531 --> 01:42:20,798
The first murder
happened there in 1949.

893
01:42:21,117 --> 01:42:24,653
Then Dalarna, Vilhelmina,
Uppsala, Karlstad.

894
01:42:24,654 --> 01:42:25,554
Yeah.

895
01:42:25,621 --> 01:42:28,582
If Harald had been there,
he must have left his line.

896
01:42:28,591 --> 01:42:33,003
What do you mean?
- The accounts of Vanger Corporation.

897
01:42:33,129 --> 01:42:36,842
Business expenses. There has to be
something, hotels, restaurants...

898
01:42:36,843 --> 01:42:37,943
there must be receipts.

899
01:42:38,051 --> 01:42:40,837
You think he got a tax deduction
for murdering someone?

900
01:42:40,863 --> 01:42:44,391
Well, I know a little something
about businessmen.

901
01:42:45,435 --> 01:42:49,145
Even if we prove he's been
everywhere, it doesn't mean anything.

902
01:42:53,985 --> 01:42:58,154
You think he might be out hunting.
- Wanna break into his place?

903
01:43:59,728 --> 01:44:02,840
We're gonna have to go back
quite a few years.

904
01:44:03,801 --> 01:44:05,727
There is '89...

905
01:44:07,436 --> 01:44:10,231
We need the accounts
from '49 to '66.

906
01:44:10,274 --> 01:44:13,651
Good thing Henrik has old-fashioned
business practices.

907
01:44:13,860 --> 01:44:16,861
Otherwise, everything would've been
shredded a long time ago.

908
01:44:16,871 --> 01:44:20,366
Well, as you can see there they all are,
so knock yourself out.

909
01:44:23,328 --> 01:44:28,125
Oh, uh... Miss Salander,
what exactly have you found so far?

910
01:44:28,251 --> 01:44:30,669
Thank you,
this is all I need for now.

911
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:17,552
In The Name Of The Führer
And Highest Command In The Wehrmacht...

912
01:45:54,985 --> 01:45:57,553
What the hell are you doing here?
Answer me!

913
01:45:57,554 --> 01:45:58,554
What do you want?

914
01:45:59,555 --> 01:46:01,590
Huh?
- Don't shoot.

915
01:46:01,591 --> 01:46:06,477
You wanna write a story about me,
in your bloody communist magazine, huh?

916
01:46:06,687 --> 01:46:08,331
I'm leaving.
Don't shoot.

917
01:46:08,599 --> 01:46:13,352
You broke into my home,
and now I'm free to shoot you on site.

918
01:46:13,561 --> 01:46:16,405
What the hell is going on here?

919
01:46:16,982 --> 01:46:19,784
Stay right there!
- Drop the gun, Harald.

920
01:46:19,811 --> 01:46:23,537
For God's Sake, what're you doing?
- Stay out of this, it's none of your business!

921
01:46:25,541 --> 01:46:29,127
Give me the gun. Come on.
Give me the gun.

922
01:46:41,232 --> 01:46:42,849
You okay?

923
01:46:43,693 --> 01:46:47,980
I always wondered how Gottfried had
such a gutless sack of a son?

924
01:47:01,721 --> 01:47:03,255
Okay...

925
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:09,673
Nothing...

926
01:47:18,674 --> 01:47:19,774
Nothing...

927
01:47:26,738 --> 01:47:30,775
We have to call Morell.
- We can call from my place.

928
01:47:32,944 --> 01:47:36,573
Harald's not going anywhere.
Come on.

929
01:47:57,688 --> 01:47:59,273
It's Gottfried?

930
01:48:10,527 --> 01:48:12,068
Gottfried.

931
01:48:26,836 --> 01:48:28,670
Uppsala 1964!

932
01:48:45,939 --> 01:48:49,481
January, February...
shit it's gotta be here somewhere.

933
01:48:55,866 --> 01:48:58,575
Come on...
come on...

934
01:49:03,383 --> 01:49:05,091
What the fuck?

935
01:49:07,578 --> 01:49:10,005
It can't be...

936
01:49:17,138 --> 01:49:18,972
Blue sweater...

937
01:49:29,135 --> 01:49:31,211
Holy fuck?

938
01:49:33,046 --> 01:49:34,406
Fuck.

939
01:49:52,492 --> 01:49:53,652
That better?

940
01:49:54,861 --> 01:49:58,781
He gave me a hell of a scare.
- You don't mess with Harald.

941
01:50:00,308 --> 01:50:01,943
What exactly were you doing there?

942
01:50:04,179 --> 01:50:07,501
We found out that Harriet
discovered a handful of murders...

943
01:50:07,502 --> 01:50:09,802
dating from the 1940's
to the '60's.

944
01:50:10,110 --> 01:50:14,280
We also know that she found a pattern
the police weren't aware off.

945
01:50:14,490 --> 01:50:17,150
We think that's why
she was killed.

946
01:50:18,302 --> 01:50:23,122
Yes but...
that sounds completely insane.

947
01:50:23,791 --> 01:50:27,210
Yes, but we discovered a pattern
with all the victims.

948
01:50:27,971 --> 01:50:29,481
They had Jewish names.

949
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:35,678
Oh... Well, Harald isn't exactly crazy
about Abraham's kin.

950
01:50:35,687 --> 01:50:39,682
Right. So I decided to break into his
house to see if I could find anything.

951
01:50:41,485 --> 01:50:44,353
And?
- Well, what do I know?

952
01:50:46,189 --> 01:50:48,157
He sure scared the hell outta me.

953
01:50:49,185 --> 01:50:52,814
But he definitely wasn't acting like
someone who had nothing to hide.

954
01:50:53,315 --> 01:50:54,815
That's for sure, I am.

955
01:50:54,966 --> 01:50:58,469
If Lisbeth can track down all his
expenses from business trips,

956
01:50:58,478 --> 01:51:02,106
You know, hotel bills, restaurants
we should have enough evidence...

957
01:51:02,107 --> 01:51:03,207
to put Harald away.

958
01:51:03,416 --> 01:51:05,008
She's going through everything.

959
01:51:18,341 --> 01:51:21,225
Alright. I'll call the police.

960
01:51:22,052 --> 01:51:23,745
Ask for Inspector Morell.

961
01:51:50,673 --> 01:51:52,759
What were you doing at Harald's?

962
01:52:35,596 --> 01:52:39,683
Scream, go on scream, Mikael.
Scream as much as you like.

963
01:52:39,810 --> 01:52:41,810
You think anyone's gonna hear you?

964
01:53:09,141 --> 01:53:12,968
We both know how this is
gonna end for you, don't we?

965
01:53:22,530 --> 01:53:24,856
Why?

966
01:53:25,867 --> 01:53:26,959
What do you mean why?

967
01:53:28,461 --> 01:53:30,837
All this.
- Why not?

968
01:53:32,239 --> 01:53:36,534
I'm doing what every man dreams of.
I'm taking whatever I want.

969
01:53:39,121 --> 01:53:41,874
How many girls
after the first?

970
01:53:43,377 --> 01:53:46,795
I couldn't tell you,
I've lost count.

971
01:53:46,880 --> 01:53:51,134
Actually, I had a girl in that cage
when we were dining upstairs.

972
01:53:52,487 --> 01:53:57,139
Women like that disappear
all the time, and no one misses them.

973
01:53:58,349 --> 01:54:00,894
Whores, immigrants.

974
01:54:12,698 --> 01:54:17,920
What you do with them after? What about
the references? The mutilations?

975
01:54:21,015 --> 01:54:26,655
That was my father's calling-card. He mixed
his hobby with race and religion.

976
01:54:26,723 --> 01:54:31,926
But that was a mistake, it's an
unnecessary risk leaving a body behind.

977
01:54:36,015 --> 01:54:40,976
I take them in my boat,
and I drop them in the water.

978
01:54:53,251 --> 01:54:54,743
Mikael?

979
01:55:28,980 --> 01:55:30,706
Mari was my first.

980
01:55:34,568 --> 01:55:35,802
'64.

981
01:55:37,463 --> 01:55:38,989
You were 16.

982
01:55:39,298 --> 01:55:45,044
It was Papa, Gottfried, who taught me
to strangle her, the right way.

983
01:55:54,189 --> 01:55:56,265
Why'd you do it?

984
01:55:56,617 --> 01:55:59,101
Well, it's for the sex mainly.

985
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:05,216
Once I grab them, then get them down,
rape is just the next logical step.

986
01:56:05,284 --> 01:56:08,278
And I can't leave any witnesses,
you understand?

987
01:56:08,487 --> 01:56:13,408
And through it all, I have to say
I love their disappointment in their eyes.

988
01:56:13,462 --> 01:56:19,998
Disappointment? What disappointment?
- That fact they know, they're about to die.

989
01:56:21,500 --> 01:56:26,505
It doesn't seam to fit into it,
like they planned.

990
01:56:26,715 --> 01:56:30,050
They always seam to think
that I'll show mercy.

991
01:56:32,154 --> 01:56:34,457
It's a fantastic moment...

992
01:56:37,059 --> 01:56:40,353
when they finely realize,
they're not getting away.

993
01:56:42,440 --> 01:56:43,941
When the eyes...

994
01:56:45,442 --> 01:56:47,885
grow dark and die.

995
01:56:49,888 --> 01:56:52,324
You are... you're gonna
experience that as well.

996
01:56:55,453 --> 01:56:59,341
And your sister? How did it feel
when her eyes went dark?

997
01:56:59,484 --> 01:57:03,127
Harriet disappeared.
- You expect me to believe that, huh?

998
01:57:03,137 --> 01:57:05,087
You can believe what you want.

999
01:57:08,884 --> 01:57:12,469
I would have loved doing her,
but as I told you, she disappeared.

1000
01:57:13,079 --> 01:57:14,706
Just like you're going to disappear.

1001
01:57:21,806 --> 01:57:23,132
You want some water?

1002
01:57:27,429 --> 01:57:28,638
Yes.

1003
01:57:43,971 --> 01:57:45,330
Thanks.

1004
01:57:46,333 --> 01:57:50,869
You see...
you're exactly like all the others.

1005
01:57:51,846 --> 01:57:55,401
A simple act of compassion,
like giving you water...

1006
01:57:55,402 --> 01:57:57,602
ignites the smallest ray of hope...

1007
01:57:57,644 --> 01:58:01,814
that maybe... just maybe
I might let you go and let you live.

1008
01:58:05,152 --> 01:58:06,776
See what I mean?

1009
01:58:39,063 --> 01:58:42,415
Don't worry.
It'll be quick.

1010
01:58:44,877 --> 01:58:48,613
What I'm really looking forward to
is killing your little girlfriend.

1011
01:59:04,214 --> 01:59:06,215
Come on get me,
you fucking shit.

1012
01:59:22,734 --> 01:59:25,194
You're okay?
You're okay.

1013
02:00:07,423 --> 02:00:08,957
Fuck!

1014
02:01:28,866 --> 02:01:30,571
I can't...

1015
02:01:32,441 --> 02:01:34,781
I can't move.

1016
02:01:36,682 --> 02:01:38,382
I can't move at all.

1017
02:01:41,768 --> 02:01:43,586
Help me.

1018
02:01:47,187 --> 02:01:48,887
Help me.

1019
02:01:52,015 --> 02:01:54,392
Please help me.

1020
02:03:52,509 --> 02:03:57,529
Where's Martin?
- He's not coming back.

1021
02:04:00,901 --> 02:04:02,019
What do you mean?

1022
02:04:04,697 --> 02:04:06,107
He drove off the road.

1023
02:04:11,696 --> 02:04:15,573
He's dead.
- Is that really what happened?

1024
02:04:18,319 --> 02:04:20,112
What the fuck are you saying?

1025
02:04:22,691 --> 02:04:26,635
He died in a car accident.
That's all I know. Okay?

1026
02:04:35,470 --> 02:04:36,529
Blomkvist!

1027
02:04:39,291 --> 02:04:42,861
What the hell happened here?
- In the cellar.

1028
02:05:06,396 --> 02:05:08,239
What happened out there?

1029
02:05:14,520 --> 02:05:16,813
He wasn't killed in an accident,
was he?

1030
02:05:21,401 --> 02:05:23,152
God all Mighty, Lisbeth.

1031
02:05:23,612 --> 02:05:27,859
His father taught him how to kill
when he was 16.

1032
02:05:28,860 --> 02:05:32,162
If you'd live your life that way
would have driven anybody crazy.

1033
02:05:32,188 --> 02:05:36,159
You think everyone's a fucking victim.
don't you? He almost killed you.

1034
02:05:36,168 --> 02:05:39,377
He raped and killed those girls
for the fun of it.

1035
02:05:39,387 --> 02:05:41,083
He had the same chance
as everyone else does,

1036
02:05:41,384 --> 02:05:43,184
it's fair he got what he got.

1037
02:05:44,092 --> 02:05:48,287
He wasn't a victim. He was an
evil motherfucker who hated women.

1038
02:05:53,503 --> 02:05:54,704
How did he die?

1039
02:06:01,069 --> 02:06:02,736
He burned up.

1040
02:06:08,034 --> 02:06:11,037
Could you have saved him?
- Yes.

1041
02:06:11,705 --> 02:06:14,748
But you just watched him burn.
- Yeah.

1042
02:07:00,339 --> 02:07:03,258
Lisbeth, I could never
have done that.

1043
02:07:05,136 --> 02:07:08,096
But I understand
why you did it.

1044
02:07:11,475 --> 02:07:14,228
I don't know
what you've been through.

1045
02:07:17,482 --> 02:07:20,568
But I almost died in that cellar...

1046
02:07:21,987 --> 02:07:24,281
and you saved my life.

1047
02:07:30,287 --> 02:07:32,706
Whatever you've been through,
in your life...

1048
02:07:35,293 --> 02:07:37,919
you don't have to tell me.

1049
02:07:41,675 --> 02:07:43,801
I'm just glad you're here.

1050
02:07:54,771 --> 02:07:56,189
Thank you.

1051
02:08:13,991 --> 02:08:17,044
For the first time in my life
I feel old.

1052
02:08:24,849 --> 02:08:25,749
Well...

1053
02:08:30,250 --> 02:08:34,804
But we're not done.
- What do you mean?

1054
02:08:35,439 --> 02:08:39,651
Harriet wasn't one of Martin's victims.
- What're you saying?

1055
02:08:39,860 --> 02:08:42,571
Martin never killed Harriet.

1056
02:08:51,073 --> 02:08:56,769
Lisbeth?

1057
02:09:22,030 --> 02:09:25,667
There are 2 women named Anita Vanger.
One of them died in London.

1058
02:09:26,010 --> 02:09:30,006
The other one lives in Australia.
Who's been there since 1966.

1059
02:10:41,664 --> 02:10:43,031
Harriet?

1060
02:10:46,893 --> 02:11:01,509
Harriet Vanger?

1061
02:11:03,210 --> 02:11:04,410
You're all right?

1062
02:11:08,710 --> 02:11:10,310
Have we met before?

1063
02:11:14,815 --> 02:11:18,678
Oh, the fact is, you and your cousin
used to babysit me years ago...

1064
02:11:18,679 --> 02:11:19,679
when I was a boy.

1065
02:11:22,531 --> 02:11:25,534
But I'm here on behalf
of Henrik Vanger.

1066
02:11:38,815 --> 02:11:40,125
Does he know I'm alive?

1067
02:11:45,664 --> 02:11:46,857
Not yet.

1068
02:12:05,285 --> 02:12:07,703
I'm here to see Agneta Salander.

1069
02:12:07,954 --> 02:12:10,615
And who should I say is here?
- Her daughter.

1070
02:12:10,983 --> 02:12:15,002
Her daughter?
Agneta has daughter?

1071
02:12:17,214 --> 02:12:20,792
I'm sorry, it's just...
I've never seen you before.

1072
02:12:59,093 --> 02:13:00,675
Hi, Mama.

1073
02:13:04,105 --> 02:13:05,339
Mama?

1074
02:13:08,310 --> 02:13:09,644
It's me. Lisbeth.

1075
02:13:19,471 --> 02:13:20,622
Lisbeth...

1076
02:13:29,706 --> 02:13:31,749
Is it really you, Lisbeth?

1077
02:13:33,670 --> 02:13:36,671
I've been wanted to come
see you for a long time.

1078
02:13:45,181 --> 02:13:47,558
You look so different.

1079
02:13:54,315 --> 02:13:57,693
Do you have children?
- No.

1080
02:14:01,416 --> 02:14:03,033
Do you have a man?

1081
02:14:08,415 --> 02:14:09,374
There's someone...

1082
02:14:16,256 --> 02:14:17,757
but you should never fall in love.

1083
02:14:19,718 --> 02:14:21,728
You know that better than anyone.

1084
02:14:27,243 --> 02:14:28,761
Isn't that right, Mama?

1085
02:14:37,737 --> 02:14:40,739
I should have chose
a better papa for you.

1086
02:14:42,166 --> 02:14:46,579
No, Ma.
your the one he hurt.

1087
02:14:54,388 --> 02:14:55,614
Mama...

1088
02:15:07,460 --> 02:15:08,611
Come in.

1089
02:15:14,860 --> 02:15:17,978
Mikael.
Good to have you back again.

1090
02:15:20,248 --> 02:15:21,485
I've got a surprise for you,

1091
02:15:21,486 --> 02:15:23,886
but you have to promise me
you won't have another heart attack.

1092
02:15:24,894 --> 02:15:29,082
With all the pills
I'm popping left and right, I think...

1093
02:15:29,091 --> 02:15:32,795
another heart attack would be
physically impossible.

1094
02:16:00,640 --> 02:16:01,833
Harriet?

1095
02:16:24,249 --> 02:16:25,742
Please, forgive me.

1096
02:16:36,762 --> 02:16:37,827
I'm sorry.

1097
02:16:41,528 --> 02:16:43,028
I'm sorry.

1098
02:16:54,131 --> 02:16:57,884
I was 14 when Papa raped me,
the first time.

1099
02:16:59,303 --> 02:17:02,347
A year later he took me
to his cottage.

1100
02:17:03,982 --> 02:17:06,517
That's when Martin joined in.

1101
02:17:09,855 --> 02:17:14,902
They would... violate me
several times, each taking a turn.

1102
02:17:18,865 --> 02:17:20,908
One day I'd had enough.

1103
02:17:25,330 --> 02:17:27,915
Papa was drunk as usual.

1104
02:17:36,050 --> 02:17:41,137
He reeled off Bible verses and boasted
about all the women he'd killed.

1105
02:17:48,938 --> 02:17:51,931
I took one of the oars from the boat
and hit him over the head with it.

1106
02:18:00,951 --> 02:18:04,495
I held him under the water
with the oar until the bubbles stopped.

1107
02:18:22,640 --> 02:18:26,101
Then I pushed the boat away from the dock
to make it look like an accident.

1108
02:18:28,479 --> 02:18:30,039
But when I turned around...

1109
02:18:33,819 --> 02:18:35,527
Martin was there.

1110
02:18:38,907 --> 02:18:41,635
Martin treated me even worse
than Gottfried.

1111
02:18:43,370 --> 02:18:46,456
You had sent him to a boarding school
in Uppsala,

1112
02:18:47,416 --> 02:18:49,727
but on Children's Day
he came back.

1113
02:18:52,296 --> 02:18:55,965
I was terrified
it would start all over again.

1114
02:19:04,092 --> 02:19:05,828
So you went to Anita?

1115
02:19:07,521 --> 02:19:11,690
She was the one...
who helped me get away from here.

1116
02:19:11,983 --> 02:19:16,237
When the bridge-way opened,
I got into her car and she drove.

1117
02:19:16,447 --> 02:19:21,150
There was a box full of old blankets
and I hit under one in the back.

1118
02:19:25,165 --> 02:19:29,042
I've been thinking about you...
over the years...

1119
02:19:29,067 --> 02:19:31,389
I continued sending you
the framed flowers...

1120
02:19:32,140 --> 02:19:37,842
so that you might know that I was
still alive out there somewhere.

1121
02:19:41,022 --> 02:19:43,661
That's when I was so upset
when Mikael told me...

1122
02:19:43,662 --> 02:19:45,862
you had thought the flowers
were coming from...

1123
02:19:46,662 --> 02:19:48,592
Yes, but had you never sent them,

1124
02:19:49,993 --> 02:19:51,993
you wouldn't be sitting here now,
would you?

1125
02:20:02,161 --> 02:20:03,446
Yeah.

1126
02:20:19,864 --> 02:20:22,472
Lisbeth, uh...
great, it's me again.

1127
02:20:23,942 --> 02:20:26,478
And call me
when you get this message.

1128
02:20:27,714 --> 02:20:28,714
And...

1129
02:20:29,315 --> 02:20:33,151
I hope you're doing well.
Call me.

1130
02:20:46,584 --> 02:20:47,959
You have a visitor.

1131
02:20:48,586 --> 02:20:50,578
Thirty minutes.
- Alright.

1132
02:20:57,945 --> 02:20:59,963
I'm so happy to see you.

1133
02:21:07,597 --> 02:21:09,015
Here.

1134
02:21:09,766 --> 02:21:12,651
What's this?
- It's a little reading.

1135
02:21:19,910 --> 02:21:24,405
Aren't you gonna sit down?
- I just came to give you that.

1136
02:21:43,226 --> 02:21:46,019
I only got
a month and a half left.

1137
02:22:16,604 --> 02:22:18,289
WE All  HAVE SECRETS

1138
02:23:02,968 --> 02:23:07,548
The Wennerström empire resembles
a living, breathing organism...

1139
02:23:10,651 --> 02:23:16,012
Reporter Mikael Blomkvist, who recently
finished serving a sentence...

1140
02:23:16,055 --> 02:23:20,383
for libelling millionaire business tycoon
Hans-Erik Wennerström...

1141
02:23:20,662 --> 02:23:23,989
is accusing him again
in the magazine Millennium.

1142
02:23:24,098 --> 02:23:28,134
In the article Blomkvist accuses
Wennerström of using his companies...

1143
02:23:28,144 --> 02:23:29,937
to commit fraud and embezzlement.

1144
02:23:29,947 --> 02:23:31,191
Hello there...
- Blomkvist!

1145
02:23:31,192 --> 02:23:34,092
why you're going after Wennerström again?
- Oh, well, I guess I felt like it.

1146
02:23:34,201 --> 02:23:36,363
What do you think will happen to him?
- I couldn't tell you...

1147
02:23:36,364 --> 02:23:38,264
but there's a nice warm
empty cell back there.

1148
02:23:38,364 --> 02:23:43,093
Blomkvist describes in detail a financial
empire based on Third World cartels.

1149
02:23:43,102 --> 02:23:48,100
These cartels are known to be involved
in drug trafficking and gun-running.

1150
02:23:49,309 --> 02:23:51,201
There he is!

1151
02:23:55,073 --> 02:23:56,573
Skoal!

1152
02:23:56,599 --> 02:24:00,802
The fugitive tycoon Hans-Erik Wennerström,
was found dead this morning...

1153
02:24:00,803 --> 02:24:04,315
by a cleaning woman
in an apartment in Marbella, Spain.

1154
02:24:05,124 --> 02:24:08,252
The financier had just celebrated
his 44th birthday.

1155
02:24:08,504 --> 02:24:11,814
According to the police, Wennerström
appears to have committed suicide...

1156
02:24:11,815 --> 02:24:14,093
since there was no evidence
of foul play.

1157
02:24:14,260 --> 02:24:17,597
The police have examined all of
Wennerström's bank accounts...

1158
02:24:17,623 --> 02:24:20,753
and it appears that several million
Swedish kroner...

1159
02:24:20,762 --> 02:24:23,421
have been withdrawn from a
bank account in the Cayman Islands.

1160
02:24:24,131 --> 02:24:29,092
According to our source it's believed
they're trying to locate the missing funds.

1161
02:24:30,235 --> 02:24:34,939
Also police sources tell us that they
are seeking an unidentified young woman...

1162
02:24:34,948 --> 02:24:37,750
who was caught on a
bank surveillance camera.

1163
02:24:52,592 --> 02:24:54,251
Lisbeth...
