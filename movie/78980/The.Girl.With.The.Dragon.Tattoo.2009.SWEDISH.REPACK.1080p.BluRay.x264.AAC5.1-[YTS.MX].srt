THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO

4
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:19,680
BASED ON STIEG LARSSON'S NOVEL

5
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:02,097
Today the verdict was delivered
in the Wennerström case.

6
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:07,811
The publisher of Millennium
Magazine, Mikael Blomkvist, -

7
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,564
- has been accused of libel -

8
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:14,776
- by successful businessman
Hans-Erik Wennerström.

9
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:19,907
Blomkvist had accused Wennerström of
gun-running and other serious felonies -

10
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:22,868
- amounting to over 60 million kroner.

11
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:26,914
The Swedes have never agreed
on Mikael Blomkvist.

12
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,918
His supporters claim
he's the last bastion -

13
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:33,837
- of a journalism with ideals.

14
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,381
But Blomkvist's long career -

15
00:03:36,591 --> 00:03:39,343
- as a watchdog may now be over.

16
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,891
In the case of
Wennerström versus Millennium, -

17
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:51,897
- the accused Mikael Blomkvist is
found guilty on 6 out of 8 counts.

18
00:03:52,357 --> 00:03:56,276
The accused is sentenced to
three months in jail -

19
00:03:56,444 --> 00:04:01,907
- and will pay damages of 150,000
kroner to Hans-Erik Wennerström.

20
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,792
You have to stop people
like Kalle Blomkvist -

21
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:18,382
- who sniff around in other people's
business due to political differences.

22
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,302
- How will you celebrate?
- No comment.

23
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:23,929
There he is.

24
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,225
- What's it like to be found guilty?
- Wonderful.

25
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,396
Can you continue
your work as a reporter?

26
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:38,318
- Cheers, everybody. Merry Christmas.
- Cheers. Merry Christmas.

27
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,488
- Cheers.
- How do we appeal the verdict?

28
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,784
We support you
one hundred per cent, Micke.

29
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,996
But we have to do something.
Our advertisers are losing trust.

30
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:54,251
- We won't win it back by appealing.
- But it'll buy us some time.

31
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,879
- No appeal. It's over.
- Millennium's future is at stake.

32
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:01,925
The faster this ends,
the better for Millennium.

33
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,429
I don't want
to play devil's advocate, -

34
00:05:05,638 --> 00:05:10,183
- but it might be a good idea
if Mikael took leave from Millennium.

35
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,436
Till this thing's blown over.

36
00:05:19,235 --> 00:05:20,986
Merry Christmas.

37
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,118
Wait, Micke.

38
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:32,622
- They're in shock.
- Only Janne dares to speak the truth.

39
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:37,044
- I was set up. I'm a problem.
- We just have to find a way.

40
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,004
It's empty in here.

41
00:05:40,423 --> 00:05:43,550
I haven't written a single word
for months now.

42
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:49,222
Do you understand?

43
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,065
WENNERSTRÖM
KNOCKS OUT BLOMKVIST

44
00:06:47,323 --> 00:06:49,574
GOING TO PRISON

45
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,458
Damn.

46
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:25,360
We don't normally introduce
the researchers to our clients.

47
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:29,948
But your client is special to us,
so we'll make an exception.

48
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,076
- It's much appreciated.
- But I must warn you.

49
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:38,915
- Lisbeth is a pretty odd girl.
- What do you mean by odd?

50
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,836
Make no mistake.
She's the best researcher we have.

51
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,005
Good morning, Lisbeth.

52
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:52,179
Good morning.

53
00:07:53,097 --> 00:07:55,056
Dirch Frode.

54
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:21,416
Transcripts of text messages.

55
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:24,628
E-mails. Bank statements.

56
00:08:25,963 --> 00:08:29,007
How did you get access
to all this?

57
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:32,177
You order the goods.
I deliver them.

58
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,100
What can you tell me
about Blomkvist?

59
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:43,271
- It's all in my report.
- The short version.

60
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:48,109
Blomkvist was nicknamed after fictional
boy detective Kalle Blomkvist -

61
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:50,862
- when he foiled
a bank robbery in the eighties.

62
00:08:51,072 --> 00:08:55,575
He's a public figure without any big
secrets. Read all the news clippings.

63
00:08:56,702 --> 00:09:01,331
- But he does have secrets?
- Everyone has secrets.

64
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:06,211
To what extent is he affected by
the crisis at Millennium?

65
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,215
- Financially, I mean.
- Why don't you just read the report?

66
00:09:10,341 --> 00:09:14,177
Miss Salander,
is there anything you'd like to add?

67
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,472
What's your personal take on him?

68
00:09:19,267 --> 00:09:22,352
There's something fishy
about the Wennerström case.

69
00:09:22,603 --> 00:09:26,690
What do you mean?
There's more to the case?

70
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:29,776
I'm researching Blomkvist,
not doing his job.

71
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:34,322
I'd just like to hear
your personal opinion.

72
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:38,952
Blomkvist's totally clean.
I didn't find anything on him.

73
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:42,914
I don't think he faked any evidence
against Wennerström.

74
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,083
I think he was set up.

75
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:49,546
Why didn't you ask me?

76
00:09:49,755 --> 00:09:54,301
- No lawyer could save me.
- I know. I read the verdict.

77
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:57,387
I didn't want to involve you.

78
00:09:57,638 --> 00:10:01,975
But you could've asked me.
I'm your sister.

79
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:04,477
- I know.
- I'm glad.

80
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:08,273
I'm already in the gutter.
Why drag the family down with me?

81
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:11,568
And you're going to prison.
It's insane.

82
00:10:11,777 --> 00:10:18,241
The secret to good meatballs
is to wet your fingers.

83
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:21,911
When you roll them,
rub your hands together.

84
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,497
Shit. Will you answer it, please?

85
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:32,130
- Hello, this is Micke Blomkvist.
- You little rascal.

86
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,300
- This is Mikael.
- Mikael Blomkvist?

87
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:40,138
- Yes. Who's this?
- My name's Dirch Frode.

88
00:10:40,306 --> 00:10:44,100
I'm a lawyer and I have
a client who'd like to see you.

89
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:48,313
- It's Christmas. What is it about?
- My client will tell you himself.

90
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:51,316
Call Millennium after New Year's Eve.

91
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,319
My client doesn't like waiting.

92
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:57,280
- Who's your client?
- Henrik Vanger.

93
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,866
From the Vanger Group?

94
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:03,453
My client would be very grateful
if you'd come.

95
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:07,165
Listen, it's Christmas,
and it's been a hell of a week.

96
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,794
I promise
you'll find it interesting.

97
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:35,068
Blomkvist!

98
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:47,372
Henrik lives on the island of Hedeby,
a mile or two from Hedestad.

99
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:59,884
The bridge is the only link
to the mainland.

100
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:17,068
In the old days, the Swedish
business elite came here.

101
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:21,030
Now it's just Henrik and his
housekeeper Anna who live here.

102
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:30,623
Thank you for coming, Mikael.

103
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:35,628
Frode's call was pretty unusual.

104
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:41,426
- Are you hungry? It's lunchtime.
- No thanks. Let's get started.

105
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,430
- I'm going back again today.
- Right. No lunch then.

106
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,522
Do you remember her?

107
00:12:56,984 --> 00:13:01,196
It's Harriet Vanger,
my brother Gottfried's daughter.

108
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,407
You've met her.

109
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,327
This girl?

110
00:13:08,496 --> 00:13:13,500
Your father worked for me
during the summer of 1965.

111
00:13:13,667 --> 00:13:18,379
He was a mechanical engineer at
the plant and lived in a cottage here.

112
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:23,092
You and your mother
came for visits -

113
00:13:23,135 --> 00:13:25,220
- during the weekends.

114
00:13:26,180 --> 00:13:28,181
Harriet looked after you.

115
00:13:28,390 --> 00:13:32,143
You often played
down there by the water.

116
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,149
I remember her.

117
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:44,155
- Harriet.
- I never had any children of my own.

118
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:49,244
Harriet was the apple of my eye.
An incredibly smart girl.

119
00:13:49,453 --> 00:13:52,789
She was like a daughter to me.

120
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:57,669
What happened to her?

121
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:04,259
- I believe she was killed.
- Killed?

122
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:15,019
This is the Vanger family, Mikael.
My family.

123
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:22,026
September 22nd, 1966. On that day
the family gathered in this house -

124
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:25,071
- for the yearly board meeting.

125
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:29,826
30 small-minded
and greedy people -

126
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:34,205
- fighting for
the biggest slice of the cake.

127
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,417
One of these people...

128
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,921
...killed Harriet.

129
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:48,219
Harriet was 16 years old.
It was Children's Day.

130
00:14:49,138 --> 00:14:53,892
She'd been to Hedestad to
watch the parade in the main street.

131
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:57,228
This picture
was in the local paper.

132
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,274
She returned to the island
around two o'clock.

133
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:05,236
She wanted to see me, but...

134
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,156
...I was too busy
with the meeting.

135
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:11,951
How was she killed?

136
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:18,291
Nobody knows.
She just disappeared.

137
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:23,046
You're well prepared.

138
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:27,467
I've been thinking about
that day for 40 years.

139
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,179
That's what I call preparation.

140
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:38,686
Quarter after two there was a serious
road accident on the bridge.

141
00:15:38,896 --> 00:15:44,275
A fuel tanker full of gas
crashed into a car.

142
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,195
The tanker
was blocking the bridge.

143
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,366
It spilled gasoline
all over the place.

144
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:56,329
Nobody could pass the tanker.
Everyone had to stay on the island.

145
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,208
By chance,
a photographer caught this.

146
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,336
Look at the window.

147
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:08,800
This is the last picture
taken of Harriet.

148
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:15,390
Officer Morell from Hedestad Police
was in charge of the investigation.

149
00:16:15,599 --> 00:16:21,270
He found this film
and had the photo blown up.

150
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:25,149
Since then nobody has seen her.

151
00:16:26,777 --> 00:16:30,989
We waited for her at dinner,
but she never turned up.

152
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,286
- Hello?
- Lisbeth Salander?

153
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:40,623
- Who's this?
- It's the probation department.

154
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,460
I'm calling to tell you
you've got a new guardian.

155
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:46,337
I already have one.

156
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:51,217
Your current guardian
has had a stroke -

157
00:16:51,343 --> 00:16:54,345
- so I've had to find you
a new one.

158
00:16:55,723 --> 00:16:59,809
I'm glad we could meet
even though it's Christmas.

159
00:17:02,354 --> 00:17:05,606
It's a little unfortunate -

160
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:11,279
- that Palmgren had such a relaxed
attitude towards guardianship laws.

161
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:15,408
I see you were allowed
to control your own finances.

162
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:20,371
- There haven't been any problems.
- No, maybe not.

163
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:25,376
But as your guardian, I'm legally
and financially responsible.

164
00:17:25,419 --> 00:17:31,424
So I'm to blame if you suddenly
can't come up with your rent.

165
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:34,844
I work.
I earn my own money.

166
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:42,393
Yes, I can see you work for
Milton Security...

167
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:47,398
- What do you do?
- I make coffee and photocopies.

168
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:53,071
This is what we'll do:

169
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,408
From now on your pay will be deposited
into a new account that I administer.

170
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,538
Each month you'll get a small amount
for personal necessities, -

171
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:07,543
- but all other expenses have to be
approved by me. Okay?

172
00:18:13,425 --> 00:18:17,470
How do you look after
your personal hygiene?

173
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,347
What do you mean?

174
00:18:20,349 --> 00:18:24,477
With all those rings.
Don't you get infections?

175
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,733
Do you have a boyfriend?

176
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:33,528
No.

177
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:36,572
Have you ever had sex?

178
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,450
I'm 24.

179
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:45,456
I can either write down
that you are cooperating, -

180
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:49,335
- or that you are causing problems
and being difficult.

181
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:54,132
And then your life'll get harder
very quickly.

182
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,928
So how many people
have you had sex with?

183
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,474
- Two.
- Two?

184
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:08,604
200.
No. 2,000.

185
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:13,484
- 200,000. Are we done now?
- What kind of sex do you have?

186
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,488
Any special preferences?

187
00:19:22,494 --> 00:19:24,912
What if she simply ran off?

188
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:29,500
You have to keep the accident in mind.
The bridge was closed for 24 hours.

189
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:32,378
That's the only way off the island.

190
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:35,798
So Harriet disappeared
when nobody could leave.

191
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:41,179
It was only the next day we started
thinking there might be a crime.

192
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:46,559
But then the bridge was open and the
killer could've disposed of the body.

193
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:49,645
She could have drowned,
killed herself.

194
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:55,318
We dragged for her body. We had
tracker dogs and divers everywhere.

195
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:58,529
Even today,
when I go for a walk, -

196
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:01,532
- I catch myself looking for her.

197
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:08,831
When Harriet was eight,
she gave me a birthday present.

198
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,543
A framed bluebell
from 1958.

199
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:15,546
After that she gave me
a new flower each year.

200
00:20:16,965 --> 00:20:20,551
1966.
The year Harriet disappeared.

201
00:20:22,763 --> 00:20:25,514
We're going to the attic.

202
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:44,033
Amazing.

203
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:48,829
Every damn year, I receive
a framed flower on my birthday -

204
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,457
- from some far corner
of the world.

205
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,879
- Who do you believe sends them?
- Harriet's killer.

206
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:02,385
You don't know my family. You don't
know what they're capable of.

207
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:10,393
Harriet was my favorite. That made her
the ideal victim for those -

208
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:13,604
- who wanted more power
in the Vanger Group.

209
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,401
They wanted to crush me.

210
00:21:19,611 --> 00:21:23,906
I'm 82 years old.
The police gave up long ago.

211
00:21:24,116 --> 00:21:27,493
I'll end up going to my grave
without knowing.

212
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,621
Help me by giving it one last try.

213
00:21:30,747 --> 00:21:34,000
- Why me?
- I've followed your career.

214
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,044
You're a damn good reporter.
Persistent.

215
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:41,632
I'm not asking you to solve
the mystery. Just try.

216
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:45,094
You've six months before
you have to serve your sentence.

217
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,057
You've devoted 40 years to...

218
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:54,103
I'll pay you handsomely.

219
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:58,441
You'll be well off.
You've got nothing to lose.

220
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:02,486
Nothing's waiting for you
in Stockholm.

221
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:14,749
"Mikael Blomkvist resigns from
Millennium's board -

222
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:17,668
- and will no longer
work for the magazine."

223
00:22:17,711 --> 00:22:21,672
Did you write this press release
without talking to me?

224
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,595
Only I could make that decision.

225
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:34,685
What now?

226
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:38,356
I'll work for Henrik Vanger.

227
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,524
Henrik Vanger?

228
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:45,363
I see. So now you're working for
the big capitalists?

229
00:22:46,698 --> 00:22:49,533
It's not for the Vanger Group.

230
00:22:53,789 --> 00:22:55,706
You're gonna stay there?

231
00:22:57,334 --> 00:22:59,126
In Hedestad?

232
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:08,928
Have a nice trip.

233
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,584
Come on, motherfucker!

234
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,885
What are you looking at?

235
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,808
- What the fuck?
- What are you doing, damn bitch?

236
00:24:38,894 --> 00:24:41,770
That bitch is going down.

237
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,696
- Fucking bitch!
- Get her down!

238
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:02,500
- The bitch is fucking crazy.
- Come again, you cunts!

239
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:05,961
Come on.

240
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,728
Shit.

241
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,314
What do you think?

242
00:25:27,859 --> 00:25:30,528
- I can save the hard drive.
- Good.

243
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:37,701
And the rest?

244
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,707
You have to go shopping.

245
00:25:46,711 --> 00:25:50,172
- How did it happen?
- Never mind.

246
00:25:53,885 --> 00:25:56,428
You stink of beer.

247
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,557
You think you smell
like you just took a shower?

248
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:07,273
You can borrow my old computer.

249
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,609
I'm using it for back-up,
so it has to stay here.

250
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:34,717
Welcome to Hedeby.

251
00:26:34,884 --> 00:26:38,804
Wonderfully refreshing
with this icy weather.

252
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,809
You didn't want to stay in the main
building. I hope you'll like it here.

253
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:53,736
If it gets any colder,
the pipes will freeze.

254
00:26:53,903 --> 00:26:57,156
Then you'll have to
come to me for water.

255
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:01,368
Oh, there you are.
Just leave it there.

256
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:09,960
It's some of the stuff I've collected
over all these years.

257
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:15,341
There are photographs.
Police reports.

258
00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:21,972
News articles.
Even some of Harriet's belongings.

259
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,477
Well, it's a start.

260
00:28:17,654 --> 00:28:19,863
You were a beautiful babysitter.

261
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,678
What happened to you?

262
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,936
Keep Sweden pure!

263
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,106
We are the Swedish
National Socialists -

264
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:41,028
- and the Aryan race
can't do without us!

265
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:54,249
All in all, the Vangers are a
pretty unpleasant bunch.

266
00:29:54,751 --> 00:29:58,921
Most of us hate each other,
but are forced together by business.

267
00:30:00,965 --> 00:30:03,133
My brother Harald lives in there.

268
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:07,513
We don't get along, to put it mildly.

269
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:14,144
Your brothers Richard and Harald
joined a Nazi group in the 30's.

270
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,398
I see...
You already know about that.

271
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:22,236
Gottfried was a member of
the Hitler Youth.

272
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:27,032
All three were Nazis.

273
00:30:29,869 --> 00:30:32,037
Yes. And fanatics, at that.

274
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:36,834
Richard died in the
Finnish Winter War.

275
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:43,715
Harald has turned into a bitter,
old man. He never leaves the house.

276
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:49,972
Harald's daughter Cecilia
is currently in Scotland.

277
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,059
Cecilia and Harald
are not on speaking terms.

278
00:31:01,442 --> 00:31:04,486
Martin lives up there.
Harriet's brother.

279
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:09,074
He took over
the Vanger Group after me.

280
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:11,910
Hi.

281
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:16,206
Well, well. If it isn't the
famous Kalle Blomkvist.

282
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:19,501
Just call me Mikael.
Then I know who you're talking to.

283
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,921
I'm eager to hear why on earth -

284
00:31:23,131 --> 00:31:26,675
- you are to spend six months
in this godforsaken place.

285
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,306
Martin's and Harriet's father,
Gottfried, -

286
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:36,018
- led a miserable, alcoholic life
with his wife Isabella.

287
00:31:37,645 --> 00:31:42,274
I've never seen a woman be as bad
a mother as Isabella was to Harriet.

288
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,239
I stepped in and took
Harriet and Martin under my wing.

289
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:55,203
And that's all of the Vangers
who live here.

290
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:58,248
On that day, even more joined us.

291
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:02,377
Cecilia's sister Anita
who died from cancer.

292
00:32:02,629 --> 00:32:06,882
- Greger Vanger and Ulrika Vanger.
- Wait a minute.

293
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,967
Who do you suspect?

294
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,472
Nobody.

295
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:17,643
And everybody. That's where you
come into the picture.

296
00:32:55,264 --> 00:33:00,060
Dear Diary. Today I got this diary
from my dear uncle Henrik.

297
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,646
A kind, but busy, man.

298
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:07,067
He's finally home from his travels
and brought me this diary.

299
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:13,490
I'm by myself in my dad's cottage.
Anita will be here soon.

300
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,802
So you're the one
sniffing around in family matters?

301
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,347
Hell, you scared me.

302
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:24,019
Cecilia Vanger.
Henrik said you'd be here.

303
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,731
- Mikael Blomkvist.
- I recognize you from the papers.

304
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:31,735
- What have you found?
- Harriet's Bible.

305
00:34:33,404 --> 00:34:36,323
She was often up here
with my sister.

306
00:34:36,365 --> 00:34:38,325
- Anita?
- Yes.

307
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,578
The summer before she disappeared.

308
00:34:41,788 --> 00:34:47,042
- Odd, seeing that her father died here.
- Gottfried died here?

309
00:34:48,211 --> 00:34:52,798
He was drunk and fell into the lake.
They found him the next morning.

310
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,383
Just down there.

311
00:34:58,888 --> 00:35:01,848
It happened the year before
Harriet disappeared.

312
00:35:03,017 --> 00:35:05,102
Henrik said you were traveling.

313
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:08,814
I had to come home
in order to hide Harriet's body.

314
00:35:11,275 --> 00:35:14,820
We weren't allowed to be here
when we were kids. It was off-limits.

315
00:35:17,490 --> 00:35:19,116
Thanks.

316
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:26,456
Dear Diary. It's fall now.
The weather's getting colder.

317
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,710
Magda 30112.

318
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,339
Sara 32016.

319
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:38,218
BJ 32027.

320
00:35:39,262 --> 00:35:42,347
LJ 31208.

321
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,351
Mari 32018.

322
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,729
I don't understand
why Henrik hired you.

323
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:53,942
To be honest, neither do I.

324
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:57,863
With all respect,
there's nothing to find.

325
00:35:58,072 --> 00:36:00,157
It's been nearly 40 years.

326
00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:03,451
You found Harriet's diary
in her dad's cottage.

327
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:08,915
- The diary didn't help us one bit.
- What about the phone numbers?

328
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,919
- They were a complete mystery to us.
- But 32 is...

329
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:17,007
32 could be Hedestad.
30 is Norrbyn's area code.

330
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,385
But the names
and the numbers don't match.

331
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:24,472
- Did you call them up?
- We did. We even tried backwards.

332
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:29,186
We switched them, removed numbers.
We tried everything.

333
00:36:29,395 --> 00:36:34,482
In the report, she's described as
withdrawn and religiously inclined.

334
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,943
Was that your impression?

335
00:36:37,153 --> 00:36:40,947
Who isn't withdrawn at that age?

336
00:36:41,157 --> 00:36:47,162
But, yes. She kept to herself.
Anita, her cousin, knew her the best.

337
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,041
Anita is Cecilia Vanger's sister.
And Anita is dead.

338
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:54,044
She died many years ago.

339
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,882
Harriet was my first case.

340
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,636
I've thought about it
every day for nearly 40 years now.

341
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:07,891
I'm retiring this summer. It's only
now that I'm able to let it go.

342
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:12,020
There is no answer.

343
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,524
You'll only breathe life into
Henrik's obsession.

344
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,405
Give it up before you become
obsessed yourself.

345
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,167
What are you working on?

346
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:29,199
- Who's this week's victim?
- Nobody.

347
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:39,667
Still that reporter?
I thought you were done with him.

348
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,129
Why do you keep at it?

349
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,674
It's a bit slow.

350
00:39:51,806 --> 00:39:54,057
A new computer?

351
00:39:54,225 --> 00:39:59,687
- Yes, I need 20,000.
- Why do you need a 20,000 kroner PC?

352
00:40:00,689 --> 00:40:05,068
- So I can play, surf the internet.
- You often surf the internet?

353
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,947
Do you chat?

354
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:21,418
Know what, Lisbeth?

355
00:40:23,712 --> 00:40:26,714
I can't just hand you 20,000.

356
00:40:28,384 --> 00:40:31,386
- Not just like that.
- How hard can it be?

357
00:40:31,595 --> 00:40:34,389
Why can't I
look after my own money?

358
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:39,227
Hit me. Come on.

359
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,814
That's what you want, isn't it?
Hit me.

360
00:40:43,816 --> 00:40:47,735
If you give me any kind of trouble,
I'll make sure -

361
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:51,573
- you spend the rest
of your life in a closed ward.

362
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:56,161
I know all about your mental problems
and your violent background.

363
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,209
Don't get me wrong, Lisbeth...

364
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,048
I'm more than happy
to give you the 20,000.

365
00:41:10,676 --> 00:41:14,721
But, you know,
any business transaction -

366
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:20,393
- is built on trust.
I have to feel that I can trust you.

367
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,481
Can I trust you, baby?

368
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,777
Can I trust you, Lisbeth?

369
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,464
Can I trust you?

370
00:42:04,438 --> 00:42:06,814
If you're nice to me...

371
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:12,737
If you're nice to me,
I'll always be nice to you.

372
00:42:56,740 --> 00:43:00,410
- It's only 7,000.
- More than enough for a computer.

373
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:23,266
What are you looking at?

374
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:06,392
You said it was a photographer
from the paper that shot the parade.

375
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:09,937
Yes, he covered both the parade
and the accident.

376
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,566
The old part of the archive
is a jumble.

377
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:19,781
We haven't digitized it.
It's still kept in negative folders.

378
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,659
20... 30...

379
00:44:23,952 --> 00:44:27,080
...40, 50, 60...

380
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:30,917
A photographer uses
between two and ten rolls a day.

381
00:44:30,959 --> 00:44:34,170
Probably closer to ten
on Children's Day.

382
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,006
Here. September 1966.

383
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:40,468
I only need the hour
of the parade.

384
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,763
- Knock yourself out.
- They're not sorted?

385
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:47,600
If you're lucky,
they might be chronological.

386
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,813
You don't happen to have
a negative scanner and a light table?

387
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:46,093
This is the first lead in the case
in 39 years.

388
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,095
It's a start.

389
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,184
It's more than that.

390
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:56,562
Look.

391
00:46:58,023 --> 00:46:59,982
You get my drift?

392
00:47:01,527 --> 00:47:05,363
Something catches her eye.
What is it that frightens her?

393
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:08,658
Her killer.

394
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,662
He was somewhere here.

395
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:18,543
Harriet's killer is standing
across the street.

396
00:47:37,145 --> 00:47:42,149
- Coffee, Mikael?
- What have you found so far?

397
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,570
I must've read...

398
00:47:46,822 --> 00:47:51,158
...several thousand pages. People
have worked on this for 40 years.

399
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:56,622
To be perfectly honest, -

400
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:01,210
- I haven't found a thing.

401
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:09,302
Shouldn't you be in Stockholm
trying to appeal your verdict?

402
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:12,471
- Give it a break.
- You give it a break.

403
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:17,268
- Mikael's old enough to...
- I was set up.

404
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:24,191
An old class-mate gave me a tip
concerning Wennerström's company.

405
00:48:24,318 --> 00:48:28,988
It was a good story.
Good enough to nail him.

406
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:31,073
So you'd think.

407
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:34,285
Yes, because suddenly there was
an even better story -

408
00:48:34,494 --> 00:48:38,289
- about fraud and gun-running
amounting to 60 million kroner.

409
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:44,211
Wennerström's name was all over it.
So far, so good.

410
00:48:45,464 --> 00:48:50,134
Until I wrote the story.
Then all my sources disappeared.

411
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:54,347
And all of the documents and evidence
turned out to be forged.

412
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:56,307
Fake?

413
00:48:56,516 --> 00:49:00,269
So it was an attempt to lure you away
from the real scandal?

414
00:49:00,479 --> 00:49:03,064
It was too good to be true.

415
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:08,903
Do you want something that really is
too good to be true?

416
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:18,245
Single malt. 21 years old.

417
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:24,251
To hell with all the troubles
of the past. Cheers.

418
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,921
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

419
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:49,527
How about one last glass of wine?

420
00:49:55,158 --> 00:49:57,535
I think I've had more than enough.

421
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:04,917
- Thanks for a nice evening.
- Is it because of the investigation?

422
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:07,920
Because of my secretive family?

423
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:12,341
- What do you mean?
- It could be me. Right?

424
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:16,303
I guess I'm also
on your list of suspects.

425
00:50:41,580 --> 00:50:44,331
- Bjurman.
- It's Lisbeth.

426
00:50:44,458 --> 00:50:47,460
- What do you want?
- I need more money.

427
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,631
- We'll talk about it.
- I need it now.

428
00:51:01,641 --> 00:51:03,350
Welcome.

429
00:51:06,646 --> 00:51:08,481
Come on in.

430
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,655
- I just want my money.
- You'll get your money.

431
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:20,367
Thanks for your last visit. I hope
you enjoyed it as much as I did.

432
00:51:20,494 --> 00:51:23,871
I won't give you a blowjob
every time I need money.

433
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:27,792
Is that right?
Then what do you want?

434
00:51:29,669 --> 00:51:33,214
Do you want me to call
the probate department and say -

435
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:37,218
- you've trespassed
and you're threatening me?

436
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:41,764
Then we'll see how quickly
you're back in the psychiatric ward.

437
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:52,566
So?

438
00:52:26,977 --> 00:52:28,936
That's much better.

439
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,401
Like that.

440
00:52:36,486 --> 00:52:38,112
Come here.

441
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,907
Come on.

442
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,723
No!

443
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:05,074
I've got... a rule for you to learn.

444
00:54:05,283 --> 00:54:07,785
If you put up a fight...

445
00:54:07,994 --> 00:54:11,705
Are you a good girl?
Are you a good girl now?

446
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:11,528
NORSJÖ CARPENTERS

447
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:45,354
My husband died many years ago.
So it's just me left.

448
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:50,776
He worked there as a carpenter
for 24 years.

449
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:55,822
They made everything
from clothes pegs to closets.

450
00:58:55,865 --> 00:58:59,868
He built that cabinet.
And the lamp, of course.

451
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:05,666
More cake?

452
00:59:05,833 --> 00:59:10,504
Do you recall if you were in Hedestad
in September 1966?

453
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:12,589
Hedestad...

454
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,925
- In '66.
- Yes, in '66.

455
00:59:20,682 --> 00:59:25,519
- Oh, it was our honeymoon.
- Wonderful. Do you have snapshots?

456
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:28,897
We went camping.
It was all the rage back then.

457
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:33,944
It was our best holiday together.

458
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,573
But I guess honeymoons
often are.

459
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:42,286
- But do you have some snapshots?
- I sure do.

460
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,833
Who doesn't save the photos
from their honeymoon?

461
00:59:50,545 --> 00:59:53,922
In the early years,
my husband and I hiked a lot.

462
00:59:54,132 --> 00:59:59,136
My husband was a skilled hiker.
We hiked for miles.

463
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:02,556
He wasn't exactly romantic.

464
01:00:03,725 --> 01:00:05,309
Now, let's see.

465
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:08,604
Hedestad...

466
01:00:10,940 --> 01:00:14,943
Look.
So beautiful.

467
01:00:15,028 --> 01:00:19,865
Even if the photo
doesn't do the sunset justice.

468
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,950
Let's see. Here's something.

469
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:26,496
- There was a parade.
- Do you?

470
01:00:45,975 --> 01:00:49,478
What are you doing here?
I'm on my way out.

471
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:54,441
You've misunderstood the rules.
You have to make an appointment.

472
01:00:55,276 --> 01:00:56,902
Do you hear me?

473
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,647
Let me go.

474
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,027
Do you hear me? Let me go.

475
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:42,823
Do you like being tied up?

476
01:01:45,118 --> 01:01:49,913
Or is your only turn-on
tying other people up?

477
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:11,059
It's great.

478
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:15,272
Did you choose it yourself?
You didn't?

479
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,567
I think it's perfect.

480
01:02:44,552 --> 01:02:49,514
You know that show where politicians
get busted by candid cameras?

481
01:02:49,724 --> 01:02:52,100
We've got those cameras at work.

482
01:02:52,143 --> 01:02:55,353
I had one in my bag
last time I was here.

483
01:02:55,563 --> 01:02:57,898
Welcome.

484
01:03:00,109 --> 01:03:03,111
I just thought you'd make me
give you a blowjob.

485
01:03:03,237 --> 01:03:05,614
But you're sicker
than I imagined.

486
01:03:06,783 --> 01:03:11,369
It goes on for two hours. Consider the
reaction of the police and the media.

487
01:03:12,163 --> 01:03:13,955
Enjoy.

488
01:03:14,123 --> 01:03:17,751
Thanks for your last visit. I hope
you enjoyed it as much as I did.

489
01:03:17,960 --> 01:03:21,171
I won't give you a blowjob
every time I need money.

490
01:03:21,380 --> 01:03:24,966
Is that right?
Then what do you want?

491
01:04:02,004 --> 01:04:05,882
I'll tell you how we'll do this.
You just nod.

492
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:12,055
I'll look after my own account.
You'll have no access.

493
01:04:13,140 --> 01:04:15,642
I control my own finances.

494
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,189
You got that?

495
01:04:21,232 --> 01:04:25,735
Each month you write in your report
that my behavior is perfect.

496
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,738
Better than ever before.

497
01:04:28,990 --> 01:04:34,494
In exactly a year, you'll apply for
the termination of my guardianship.

498
01:04:34,704 --> 01:04:37,038
I'll send you further instructions.

499
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:41,751
You can never contact me again.

500
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:46,840
If you do, I'll send copies of
the video to the police and the press.

501
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:51,052
The same thing happens,
if I'm in an accident -

502
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,680
- or if you break my rules.

503
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,851
You got that? Good.

504
01:05:11,115 --> 01:05:15,035
I've never done this before.
Lie still or it'll get messy.

505
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,084
Lie still.

506
01:06:01,332 --> 01:06:05,794
I'M A SADIST PIG
AND A RAPIST

507
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:39,786
...during the last year...

508
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:44,207
...an avid interest in religion.

509
01:07:49,106 --> 01:07:50,857
SEND

510
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:04,079
The guy in the blue sweater.
I can't get his picture sharp.

511
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:07,832
I can't do a thing about it.
It's so out of focus.

512
01:08:08,501 --> 01:08:12,420
- Are you sure?
- Positive. I've tried everything.

513
01:08:12,546 --> 01:08:15,423
Okay, thanks for trying.

514
01:08:27,436 --> 01:08:30,438
Wasp...
Harriet's phone numbers.

515
01:08:42,284 --> 01:08:44,994
Book of Leviticus...

516
01:09:12,857 --> 01:09:15,608
"If a woman
approaches an animal..."

517
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:19,195
"If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations with it, -

518
01:09:19,405 --> 01:09:21,364
- kill both the woman and the animal."

519
01:09:21,490 --> 01:09:24,450
"Their blood
will be on their own heads."

520
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:27,495
Mari 32018.

521
01:09:29,456 --> 01:09:31,875
Magda 30112.

522
01:09:32,042 --> 01:09:35,420
Leviticus,
Chapter 1, Verse 12.

523
01:09:35,504 --> 01:09:38,882
"...she is to bring two doves
or two young pigeons, -

524
01:09:39,049 --> 01:09:42,218
- one for a burnt offering
and the other for a sin offering."

525
01:09:42,428 --> 01:09:44,512
BJ 32027.

526
01:09:44,597 --> 01:09:47,515
"A man or a woman...

527
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:51,519
"A man or a woman who is a medium
or spiritist among you -

528
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:54,606
- must be put to death.
You are to stone them."

529
01:09:58,027 --> 01:10:00,320
Must be put to death.

530
01:10:13,542 --> 01:10:16,002
Frode! What's going on?

531
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:19,255
It was Henrik.
He just collapsed.

532
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:23,176
- We'll keep you informed.
- Thanks.

533
01:10:31,185 --> 01:10:34,562
It's a heart attack.
He's having emergency surgery.

534
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,024
What are his odds?

535
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:41,069
They're talking about a bypass
so it's serious.

536
01:10:45,366 --> 01:10:47,116
- You want coffee?
- No.

537
01:10:52,998 --> 01:10:56,084
I think you should
go on with your investigation.

538
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:59,671
- Have you assigned someone else?
- No, only you.

539
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,300
Someone by the name of Wasp
has hacked into my computer.

540
01:11:05,219 --> 01:11:09,889
I've received an e-mail with copies
of one of my own documents.

541
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:14,727
So this person must have
gained access to my hard drive.

542
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:20,817
Do you know anything about this?

543
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:27,615
No...

544
01:11:27,658 --> 01:11:31,119
No, but I think I've got
a good idea -

545
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:34,122
- who it might be.

546
01:12:01,358 --> 01:12:03,359
Just stay in bed.

547
01:12:07,614 --> 01:12:09,991
Lisbeth Salander?

548
01:12:10,200 --> 01:12:13,494
- Who are you?
- You know. May I come in?

549
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:22,045
I've read your report.
Thrilling stuff.

550
01:12:22,296 --> 01:12:26,966
Particularly that you stole my files.
The police would find that intriguing.

551
01:12:27,176 --> 01:12:31,929
They also ought to know that you
are still hacking into my computer.

552
01:12:39,980 --> 01:12:43,399
If you remove those papers,
I'll take off the chain.

553
01:12:54,828 --> 01:12:56,579
What do you want?

554
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:03,086
- Hi.
- Everything all right?

555
01:13:11,845 --> 01:13:14,806
- What do you want?
- You got any coffee?

556
01:13:38,956 --> 01:13:41,666
How much do you know
about my assignment?

557
01:13:41,875 --> 01:13:44,585
The 40-year-old murder
of a 16-year-old girl.

558
01:13:47,256 --> 01:13:50,591
Until today I wasn't even sure
that she was killed.

559
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:54,011
Then you directed me to
the Biblical references -

560
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:56,889
- about women
who should be killed.

561
01:13:57,099 --> 01:14:01,811
- And?
- It's the most important clue so far.

562
01:14:05,149 --> 01:14:08,443
- And?
- I need your help.

563
01:14:10,737 --> 01:14:14,073
- I'll pay good money.
- I've already got a job.

564
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,577
You work as a professional hacker, -

565
01:14:17,619 --> 01:14:21,122
- but send me an e-mail
I can easily trace.

566
01:14:25,002 --> 01:14:26,627
Why?

567
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:33,843
Huh?

568
01:15:09,796 --> 01:15:12,048
So he'll live?

569
01:15:16,803 --> 01:15:18,971
Can I visit him?

570
01:15:21,391 --> 01:15:23,768
Lisbeth Salander's here.

571
01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:34,153
Okay, Frode.
Talk to you soon. Thanks.

572
01:15:51,088 --> 01:15:53,798
If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations...

573
01:15:55,801 --> 01:15:59,720
As we've been sharing files lately,
I assume you're up to date.

574
01:16:01,181 --> 01:16:02,723
I am.

575
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:11,148
You know... What if these quotes
don't have anything to do with God?

576
01:16:11,358 --> 01:16:13,943
What if it's a code?

577
01:16:14,152 --> 01:16:17,738
Sara Witt was found murdered
in her family's barn -

578
01:16:17,864 --> 01:16:20,658
- outside Vilhelmina in 1962.

579
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,536
Sara? What else does it say?

580
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:27,373
"Between 2 and 3 am,
the victim was lured..."

581
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:35,047
"The woman's body was mutilated,
possibly in a religious ritual.

582
01:16:35,257 --> 01:16:37,800
The police won't disclose
any more details."

583
01:16:38,010 --> 01:16:42,305
Mutilated, possibly religious...
Did they find the killer?

584
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:48,394
No. The case was never solved.

585
01:16:51,648 --> 01:16:54,775
- It's a wild guess.
- I know.

586
01:16:55,777 --> 01:17:00,156
- How far is it to Vilhelmina?
- Too far on a motorcycle.

587
01:17:19,801 --> 01:17:22,094
What are we waiting for?

588
01:17:22,304 --> 01:17:24,805
- You want to drive?
- Why?

589
01:17:26,308 --> 01:17:31,020
- I haven't driven since my divorce.
- Then it's about time.

590
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,044
Why do female names
always bring you to porn sites?

591
01:17:55,253 --> 01:17:56,962
What are you doing?

592
01:17:58,674 --> 01:18:02,843
I'm getting the computer to search
all the newspaper databases.

593
01:18:47,681 --> 01:18:49,890
Let's go to the barn.

594
01:18:52,894 --> 01:18:56,021
They couldn't sell the farm
after what happened.

595
01:18:56,273 --> 01:18:59,108
It's been empty ever since.

596
01:19:03,447 --> 01:19:05,614
This is where she was found?

597
01:19:05,824 --> 01:19:10,536
Yes. Her husband found her.
It was horrific for him. Horrific.

598
01:19:12,873 --> 01:19:14,915
She was lying right here.

599
01:19:18,170 --> 01:19:19,962
In this booth.

600
01:19:20,172 --> 01:19:23,466
Bound and tortured.

601
01:19:33,185 --> 01:19:35,853
Were the animals also harmed?

602
01:19:36,897 --> 01:19:39,148
How did you know?

603
01:19:41,610 --> 01:19:44,945
"If a woman approaches an animal
to have sexual relations with it, -

604
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:47,740
- kill both the woman and the animal."

605
01:19:51,745 --> 01:19:54,413
- It might be a coincidence.
- Yes.

606
01:19:58,960 --> 01:20:01,420
Goddamn, Lisbeth.

607
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:06,008
If the others also fit...

608
01:20:12,933 --> 01:20:15,851
I've found an old TV program.

609
01:20:18,271 --> 01:20:21,941
A program from 1999
about a murder in Dalarna.

610
01:20:21,983 --> 01:20:23,025
Go on.

611
01:20:23,235 --> 01:20:27,112
"In the series 'Swedish Murders' comes
the case of Magda Lovisa Sjöberg -

612
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,989
- from Dalarna."

613
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:32,201
Magda...

614
01:20:32,410 --> 01:20:36,789
"A brutal murder puzzle from
November 1954 that baffled the police."

615
01:20:36,957 --> 01:20:39,375
Didn't we have a Magda reference?

616
01:20:39,543 --> 01:20:42,253
Leviticus,
Chapter 1, Verse 12.

617
01:20:42,462 --> 01:20:45,548
"He is to cut it into pieces...
including the head and the fat."

618
01:20:45,799 --> 01:20:49,927
"And the priest shall arrange them...
on the burning wood on the altar."

619
01:20:51,012 --> 01:20:53,013
That was verbatim.

620
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:58,018
You quoted it word for word.

621
01:21:11,658 --> 01:21:16,287
As far as I know, Magda's body
was found after only six hours.

622
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:20,165
By a farmer who saw
the smoke from the fire.

623
01:21:20,417 --> 01:21:23,502
He thought it was
some kids having a party.

624
01:21:25,338 --> 01:21:28,090
Someone cut out fat from the body.

625
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:36,682
That's right. They found remains
of fat together with the head.

626
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:40,102
Awful.

627
01:22:20,560 --> 01:22:23,103
What the hell?
Relax!

628
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:27,149
I just wanted to wake you up.
We're there.

629
01:22:42,999 --> 01:22:44,750
Can I come in?

630
01:22:48,213 --> 01:22:50,130
Here's your bag.

631
01:22:57,138 --> 01:22:58,806
Are you okay?

632
01:23:00,600 --> 01:23:02,434
Yes, I'm okay.

633
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:40,180
I can't find anyone
who fits the initials BJ.

634
01:23:41,808 --> 01:23:45,019
But LI could be Liv Ingvartsson.

635
01:23:45,186 --> 01:23:49,481
A prostitute who disappeared in Ånge
and was found on a building site.

636
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:51,442
What was that quote again?

637
01:23:51,651 --> 01:23:53,986
"...she is to bring two doves
or two young pigeons, -

638
01:23:54,154 --> 01:23:56,196
- one for a burnt offering
and the other for a sin offering."

639
01:23:56,322 --> 01:23:59,491
"The priest will make atonement
for her, and she will be clean."

640
01:23:59,701 --> 01:24:03,620
Ånge... That's quite a few miles
in the direction we came from.

641
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:15,841
I think I've found another one.
A 17-year-old girl from Uppsala.

642
01:24:16,051 --> 01:24:19,094
- When?
- 1964.

643
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:24,058
"The Mari murder empties the streets".
"Killer still on the loose".

644
01:24:26,227 --> 01:24:28,020
There.

645
01:24:30,231 --> 01:24:34,651
Now we've got Sara, Mari,
Magda and Liv. Four murders.

646
01:24:34,861 --> 01:24:38,113
Now we only need BJ,
who's been circled.

647
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:40,324
Harriet can't have known them.

648
01:24:40,533 --> 01:24:46,538
Liv was murdered in 1949. Harriet was
born in 1950. What's the connection?

649
01:24:47,791 --> 01:24:50,793
She listed women who'd been killed
and she disappeared.

650
01:24:51,044 --> 01:24:53,504
Harriet must've known
who the killer was.

651
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,357
What is it?

652
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:16,485
Somebody's been here.

653
01:25:19,781 --> 01:25:24,284
The pictures have been touched.
The Bible is pointing in another direction.

654
01:25:27,288 --> 01:25:30,124
- Look.
- What the hell?

655
01:25:31,167 --> 01:25:33,669
Someone has been curious.

656
01:25:44,222 --> 01:25:46,348
I'll buy a new lock tomorrow.

657
01:25:59,612 --> 01:26:02,990
Lisbeth...
do you have a photographic memory?

658
01:26:20,425 --> 01:26:23,552
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

659
01:26:23,761 --> 01:26:28,015
It's fantastic if you do.
I wish that I had it.

660
01:26:55,418 --> 01:26:58,378
Damn, you gave me a scare.

661
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,381
What is it?

662
01:27:07,472 --> 01:27:09,431
What are you doing?

663
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:29,409
Are you sure it's a good idea?

664
01:28:22,463 --> 01:28:24,506
- Are you leaving?
- Good night.

665
01:28:45,945 --> 01:28:48,196
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

666
01:29:11,471 --> 01:29:13,430
Did you sleep well?

667
01:29:27,320 --> 01:29:31,531
- I'm updating Henrik. Want to come?
- I hate hospitals.

668
01:29:37,163 --> 01:29:40,540
But that's...
But that's totally absurd.

669
01:29:42,502 --> 01:29:45,921
You've found out more
than I'd hoped for.

670
01:29:47,757 --> 01:29:50,550
Just concentrate on getting well.

671
01:29:52,678 --> 01:29:55,222
I'll keep you updated.

672
01:29:55,431 --> 01:29:57,682
Regarding the last reference...

673
01:29:57,934 --> 01:30:00,018
- The last name.
- BJ.

674
01:30:00,228 --> 01:30:02,604
Ask Morell if he can help you.

675
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:10,112
Morell!

676
01:30:13,574 --> 01:30:16,159
I'll be damned!
Five murders!

677
01:30:18,955 --> 01:30:20,872
It wasn't phone numbers.

678
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:24,292
If it's any consolation,
it wasn't me who cracked it.

679
01:30:25,086 --> 01:30:28,088
We haven't found the last woman
with the initials BJ.

680
01:30:28,131 --> 01:30:32,968
She's circled as if she's particularly
important. It's the last reference.

681
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:38,098
If there's a woman with these initials
who died in the 40's, 50's or 60's, -

682
01:30:38,182 --> 01:30:43,478
- we've got to find her.
Do you realize what this means?

683
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,606
If the first murder
took place in 1949, -

684
01:30:46,816 --> 01:30:50,068
- the man who's been sending
Henrik flowers is now very old.

685
01:30:50,111 --> 01:30:53,155
It reduces the number of
suspects considerably.

686
01:31:17,680 --> 01:31:22,100
Mikael. We're glad you could make it.
Welcome.

687
01:31:22,143 --> 01:31:25,145
Harald couldn't make it.
He's hunting deer.

688
01:31:29,358 --> 01:31:31,693
To what do I owe the honor?

689
01:31:31,944 --> 01:31:34,988
Have you read
the local paper recently?

690
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:37,157
I've been out of town.

691
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:42,120
They're coming out with quite
an interesting series -

692
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,664
- on your exile here on Hedeby.

693
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:48,001
BLOMKVIST'S YOUNG NEW GIRLFRIEND

694
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:53,423
- And?
- We don't like it.

695
01:31:54,467 --> 01:31:56,468
Henrik is dying.

696
01:31:56,677 --> 01:32:00,805
My private life has nothing to do
with my assignment for Henrik.

697
01:32:01,015 --> 01:32:04,601
It reflects on everyone
in the Vanger Group.

698
01:32:04,810 --> 01:32:09,481
Haven't you done enough harm? Do you
have to give Henrik a heart attack -

699
01:32:09,690 --> 01:32:12,275
- by picking over
my daughter's death?

700
01:32:14,195 --> 01:32:18,448
- Maybe it's about time you gave up.
- What do you mean?

701
01:32:18,658 --> 01:32:22,202
You're making matters worse
by coming here with your whore.

702
01:32:22,245 --> 01:32:24,704
Don't use that tone, Mom.

703
01:32:24,914 --> 01:32:29,751
But maybe you should take a break now.
It's been a pretty hard deal.

704
01:32:32,129 --> 01:32:34,756
- I'm needed here.
- Mikael, as your friend...

705
01:32:35,007 --> 01:32:41,221
Excuse me, but I have something
to say. Henrik signed a contract.

706
01:32:42,682 --> 01:32:46,935
As long as he lives,
it cannot be cancelled.

707
01:32:47,144 --> 01:32:52,440
So whether Mikael likes it or not,
he has to continue.

708
01:33:06,455 --> 01:33:10,083
I'm sorry that it had to be
so dramatic.

709
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:13,920
- Why are you wearing Harriet's necklace?
- What do you mean?

710
01:33:14,964 --> 01:33:18,675
Harriet was wearing it when she
disappeared. Now you're wearing it.

711
01:33:18,884 --> 01:33:22,095
What are you trying to say?
Are you accusing me?

712
01:33:23,306 --> 01:33:25,807
Just tell me
where you got it from.

713
01:33:26,058 --> 01:33:30,645
I inherited it from Anita.
It never belonged to Harriet.

714
01:33:35,484 --> 01:33:37,902
Anita, your sister?

715
01:33:46,662 --> 01:33:50,290
Hi, Micke.

716
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:54,294
Everything all right?

717
01:34:05,848 --> 01:34:08,933
Anita is Harriet.
I was mistaken. It's not her.

718
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:10,977
What are you talking about?

719
01:34:11,187 --> 01:34:14,981
They both looked after me that summer.
It's Anita's necklace.

720
01:34:18,694 --> 01:34:23,239
Yes, it's Anita.
Shit, those two were so alike.

721
01:34:23,949 --> 01:34:27,952
- What do we know about Anita Vanger?
- Harriet's cousin and closest friend.

722
01:34:28,162 --> 01:34:31,873
They were together each summer.
She had no alibi, but wasn't a suspect.

723
01:34:32,124 --> 01:34:35,335
Right after Harriet's death,
she moved to London to study.

724
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:40,048
She had a brilliant career, but died
from breast cancer when she was 37.

725
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:42,133
She died 20 years ago.

726
01:34:43,302 --> 01:34:46,012
She didn't tell Morell
it was her in the window.

727
01:34:46,222 --> 01:34:50,850
- Maybe she had something to hide.
- Maybe she was covering for the killer.

728
01:35:00,277 --> 01:35:03,655
Hi, Plague. I need help.
Will you run a check on Anita Vanger?

729
01:35:08,828 --> 01:35:12,330
- Plague?
- If there is anything, he'll find it.

730
01:36:49,595 --> 01:36:52,972
- What happened?
- Some idiot shot at me.

731
01:36:54,475 --> 01:36:57,936
- Did you see who?
- No. Shit.

732
01:37:02,566 --> 01:37:06,152
We must be very close now.
And someone doesn't like it.

733
01:37:06,362 --> 01:37:09,113
Give me my cell phone.
We have to call the police.

734
01:37:09,323 --> 01:37:11,616
- What can they do?
- Go get it.

735
01:37:11,867 --> 01:37:13,993
Then I'm out of here.

736
01:37:21,502 --> 01:37:24,754
Let's not jump to
any conclusions.

737
01:37:24,964 --> 01:37:27,632
It could be a hunting accident.

738
01:37:27,883 --> 01:37:31,219
If it's not a hunting accident,
then you're not safe here.

739
01:37:32,721 --> 01:37:36,516
I think you should go home.
At least for a while.

740
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:40,895
Ever since I came here,
everyone keeps asking me to leave.

741
01:37:43,524 --> 01:37:46,401
Anything new on BJ?

742
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:51,531
We didn't find a BJ in the system.
But we'll keep on searching.

743
01:37:52,408 --> 01:37:54,951
Two cameras outside
and fire in here -

744
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:58,246
- connected to sensors.
I've got the cottage covered.

745
01:38:01,375 --> 01:38:03,418
Fantastic.

746
01:38:12,803 --> 01:38:15,430
I take it you don't want to go home?

747
01:38:18,559 --> 01:38:20,476
No.

748
01:38:30,529 --> 01:38:32,572
So now we've got it on tape?

749
01:38:35,242 --> 01:38:38,369
Yes.
It's already on the internet.

750
01:38:55,596 --> 01:38:57,680
- What are you doing?
- Sorry?

751
01:38:57,890 --> 01:39:01,476
- Go sleep in your own bed.
- I want to be close to you.

752
01:39:04,897 --> 01:39:07,148
Okay, but I want to sleep.

753
01:39:18,243 --> 01:39:22,330
What has happened to you?
How did you turn out this way?

754
01:39:26,752 --> 01:39:31,631
You know everything about me.
I don't know shit about you.

755
01:39:33,634 --> 01:39:35,593
Not a damn thing.

756
01:39:37,554 --> 01:39:39,639
That's the way it is.

757
01:40:17,302 --> 01:40:19,679
- Who is it?
- Morell.

758
01:40:23,225 --> 01:40:25,685
I've found the last one.

759
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:29,605
Rebecka Jacobsson,
nickname Bea.

760
01:40:30,733 --> 01:40:32,066
BJ.

761
01:40:33,652 --> 01:40:36,571
That's why we didn't find her.

762
01:40:37,114 --> 01:40:41,701
"A man or a woman who is a medium
or a spiritist among you...

763
01:40:41,744 --> 01:40:45,121
...must be put to death.
You are to stone them."

764
01:40:48,125 --> 01:40:50,168
It's her.

765
01:40:51,253 --> 01:40:53,963
- Where was she killed?
- In Karlstad.

766
01:40:54,173 --> 01:40:56,591
But that's not the interesting part.

767
01:40:56,717 --> 01:41:02,096
Rebecka worked for the Vanger Group
until her death in January 1965.

768
01:41:03,182 --> 01:41:06,517
As a secretary for Gottfried Vanger.

769
01:41:06,685 --> 01:41:09,854
Gottfried died before Harriet disappeared.
So it wasn't him.

770
01:41:10,105 --> 01:41:14,525
But we've got to check if she knew
other members of the Vanger family.

771
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:20,615
- Hold on.
- What?

772
01:41:20,741 --> 01:41:23,242
Rebecka and Sara are Jewish names.

773
01:41:23,452 --> 01:41:25,203
- Magda...
- Magdalena.

774
01:41:27,122 --> 01:41:29,749
Mari, Maria. But Liv?

775
01:41:33,962 --> 01:41:38,424
Liv means Eve. I bet that
Liv Ingvartsson was Jewish as well.

776
01:41:38,634 --> 01:41:42,970
Racist murders. It fits with the
pseudo religious rituals.

777
01:41:45,015 --> 01:41:47,475
But what about Harriet?

778
01:41:47,684 --> 01:41:51,187
Harriet died because she
discovered a pattern.

779
01:41:51,396 --> 01:41:53,773
How the hell could we miss it?

780
01:41:53,857 --> 01:41:57,777
They're Jewish names. There were
three Nazis in the Vanger family.

781
01:41:57,820 --> 01:42:00,696
Only one was still alive
when Harriet died.

782
01:42:01,448 --> 01:42:02,907
Harald.

783
01:42:04,743 --> 01:42:07,870
Who happened to be hunting
when you ran alone in the woods.

784
01:42:16,213 --> 01:42:18,881
The first murder
took place there in 1949.

785
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:23,636
Then Dalarna, Vilhelmina,
Uppsala, Karlstad.

786
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:27,265
If Harald has been there,
he's left traces.

787
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:31,686
- What do you mean?
- The Vanger Group accounts.

788
01:42:31,812 --> 01:42:36,524
Business travels. There must be
evidence. Restaurant and hotel bills.

789
01:42:36,733 --> 01:42:39,819
You think he got a tax deduction
for murder?

790
01:42:39,945 --> 01:42:43,072
Well, I know about businessmen.

791
01:42:44,116 --> 01:42:47,827
Even if we can prove he's been
everywhere, it's not enough.

792
01:42:52,666 --> 01:42:56,836
- Maybe he's hunting now.
- You suggest we break into his house?

793
01:43:58,607 --> 01:44:01,317
We need to go
back quite a few years.

794
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:05,905
89... 89...

795
01:44:06,114 --> 01:44:08,908
We need the accounts
from 1949 until 1966.

796
01:44:08,951 --> 01:44:12,328
Thank Henrik for his old-fashioned
business practices.

797
01:44:12,537 --> 01:44:15,539
Otherwise, they would've been
shredded long ago.

798
01:44:15,749 --> 01:44:19,043
Well, there they all are,
knock yourself out.

799
01:44:22,005 --> 01:44:26,801
Miss Salander,
what exactly have you found so far?

800
01:44:26,927 --> 01:44:29,345
Thank you, that was all.

801
01:45:13,557 --> 01:45:16,225
IN THE NAME OF THE FÜHRER
I BESTOW...

802
01:45:54,056 --> 01:45:57,725
What in God's name are you doing here?
Answer me!

803
01:45:58,727 --> 01:46:00,353
Take it easy.

804
01:46:00,562 --> 01:46:05,149
You're gonna write about me
in your damn communist magazine?

805
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:07,902
I'm leaving now. Don't shoot.

806
01:46:08,070 --> 01:46:12,323
You broke into my home,
so I'm free to kill you.

807
01:46:12,532 --> 01:46:15,076
What the hell is going on here?

808
01:46:15,952 --> 01:46:18,954
- Freeze!
- Drop the gun, Harald.

809
01:46:19,081 --> 01:46:22,208
- Come on, drop the gun.
- It's none of your business!

810
01:46:24,711 --> 01:46:27,797
Drop the gun. Drop it.

811
01:46:40,102 --> 01:46:41,519
Are you okay?

812
01:46:42,562 --> 01:46:46,649
How the hell could Gottfried have
such a wuss of a son?

813
01:47:00,789 --> 01:47:02,123
Harald...

814
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:19,140
No.

815
01:47:25,605 --> 01:47:29,442
- We've got to call Morell.
- We can call him from my place.

816
01:47:31,611 --> 01:47:35,239
Harald's not going anywhere.
Come on.

817
01:47:56,553 --> 01:47:58,637
Gottfried?

818
01:48:09,191 --> 01:48:10,733
Gottfried.

819
01:48:25,499 --> 01:48:27,333
Uppsala 1964!

820
01:48:44,601 --> 01:48:46,644
January, February...

821
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:57,238
Wasn't there a group photo?

822
01:49:02,244 --> 01:49:03,953
What the fuck?

823
01:49:06,540 --> 01:49:08,666
It can't be true.

824
01:49:15,799 --> 01:49:17,633
Blue sweater...

825
01:49:28,395 --> 01:49:30,271
What the fuck?

826
01:49:32,107 --> 01:49:33,566
Shit.

827
01:49:51,751 --> 01:49:53,711
Feeling better now?

828
01:49:53,920 --> 01:49:57,840
- He gave me a hell of a scare.
- You don't mess with Harald.

829
01:49:58,967 --> 01:50:01,302
What were you doing in his house?

830
01:50:03,138 --> 01:50:08,559
Harriet discovered a handful of
murders from the 40's to the 60's.

831
01:50:08,768 --> 01:50:12,938
We know she found a pattern
the police didn't know about.

832
01:50:13,148 --> 01:50:16,108
We believe that's why
she was killed.

833
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:21,780
But that...
It sounds totally insane.

834
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:25,868
We've found a pattern
regarding the victims.

835
01:50:26,328 --> 01:50:29,038
They've all got Jewish names.

836
01:50:29,247 --> 01:50:34,335
Well, Harald isn't exactly crazy about
Abraham's kin.

837
01:50:34,544 --> 01:50:38,339
No. So I went to his house
to see if I could find anything.

838
01:50:40,342 --> 01:50:43,010
- And?
- Well, what do I know?

839
01:50:44,846 --> 01:50:47,014
He turned up so soon.

840
01:50:48,141 --> 01:50:51,769
But he didn't exactly act innocent.

841
01:50:54,022 --> 01:50:58,025
If Lisbeth can track down his
travel activities from the accounts, -

842
01:50:58,234 --> 01:51:01,862
- we've got evidence against him.
Bills, invoices.

843
01:51:02,072 --> 01:51:03,864
She's going through everything.

844
01:51:17,295 --> 01:51:19,880
Very well. I'll call the police.

845
01:51:21,007 --> 01:51:22,800
Try Morell.

846
01:51:49,327 --> 01:51:51,412
What were you doing at Harald's?

847
01:51:54,290 --> 01:51:56,208
There, there.

848
01:52:34,247 --> 01:52:38,333
Scream as much as you want to, Mikael.
Scream as much as you can.

849
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:40,461
You think anyone'll hear you?

850
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:11,617
We both know how it's
going to end for you.

851
01:53:21,878 --> 01:53:23,504
Why?

852
01:53:24,714 --> 01:53:26,507
Why what?

853
01:53:27,509 --> 01:53:29,885
- All of this.
- Why not?

854
01:53:31,387 --> 01:53:35,182
I do what every man dreams of.
I take what I want.

855
01:53:37,769 --> 01:53:40,521
How many women after the first?

856
01:53:42,023 --> 01:53:45,442
I don't know. I've lost count.

857
01:53:45,527 --> 01:53:49,780
I had a girl in that cage
when we were dining upstairs.

858
01:53:51,533 --> 01:53:55,786
Those kinds of women disappear
all the time. Nobody misses them.

859
01:53:56,996 --> 01:53:59,540
Whores, immigrants.

860
01:54:11,344 --> 01:54:16,265
What do you do with them? What about
the references? The mutilations?

861
01:54:20,061 --> 01:54:25,399
That was my father's project. He mixed
his hobby with race and religion.

862
01:54:25,567 --> 01:54:30,571
But it was a mistake.
You shouldn't leave the bodies behind.

863
01:54:34,659 --> 01:54:39,621
I take them for a trip in my boat
and then I drop them into the sea.

864
01:54:52,594 --> 01:54:54,386
Mikael?

865
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:30,047
Mari was my first.

866
01:55:33,509 --> 01:55:34,843
64.

867
01:55:36,304 --> 01:55:37,930
You were 16 years old.

868
01:55:38,139 --> 01:55:43,685
It was Dad, Gottfried, who taught me
how I should strangle her.

869
01:55:53,029 --> 01:55:54,905
It's sick.

870
01:55:55,657 --> 01:55:57,741
It's mainly for the sex.

871
01:55:59,327 --> 01:56:04,456
When I put them down, it's only
a logical consequence of the rape.

872
01:56:04,624 --> 01:56:06,917
You can't leave any witnesses.

873
01:56:07,126 --> 01:56:12,047
Even though I have to admit
I love seeing their disappointment.

874
01:56:14,801 --> 01:56:18,637
- Disappointment?
- When they realize they'll die.

875
01:56:20,139 --> 01:56:25,143
It doesn't really fit into
their scheme of things.

876
01:56:25,353 --> 01:56:28,689
They always think
I'll show them mercy.

877
01:56:31,192 --> 01:56:33,694
It's a fantastic moment -

878
01:56:35,697 --> 01:56:38,991
- when they realize
they're not going to get away.

879
01:56:41,077 --> 01:56:43,078
When the eyes...

880
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:46,623
...switch off and die.

881
01:56:48,626 --> 01:56:50,961
You'll experience that yourself.

882
01:56:54,590 --> 01:56:58,677
And your sister? What did it feel like
when your sister's eyes died?

883
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:01,763
- Harriet disappeared.
- You want me to believe that?

884
01:57:01,973 --> 01:57:04,224
Believe whatever the hell you want.

885
01:57:07,520 --> 01:57:11,106
I would have enjoyed killing her.
But she disappeared.

886
01:57:11,816 --> 01:57:13,942
Just like you'll disappear.

887
01:57:20,742 --> 01:57:22,868
Do you want some water?

888
01:57:26,664 --> 01:57:27,873
Yes, please.

889
01:57:42,805 --> 01:57:44,264
Thanks.

890
01:57:45,767 --> 01:57:49,603
You see...
you're just like everybody else.

891
01:57:50,980 --> 01:57:56,735
It only takes a simple, human gesture
to ignite the small hope -

892
01:57:56,778 --> 01:58:00,447
- that I might let you go after all.

893
01:58:03,785 --> 01:58:05,410
Right?

894
01:58:38,694 --> 01:58:41,446
Take it easy. It'll be quick.

895
01:58:43,908 --> 01:58:47,744
I'm mostly looking forward to
your little girlfriend.

896
01:59:02,844 --> 01:59:04,845
Come on, motherfucker.

897
01:59:21,863 --> 01:59:23,822
Are you okay?

898
02:00:06,449 --> 02:00:08,283
Fuck!

899
02:01:27,989 --> 02:01:33,493
I can't...

900
02:01:35,663 --> 02:01:43,003
I can't move.

901
02:01:46,090 --> 02:01:48,008
Help me.

902
02:01:50,636 --> 02:01:53,013
Please help me.

903
02:03:51,424 --> 02:03:56,344
- Where's Martin?
- He's not coming back.

904
02:04:00,015 --> 02:04:01,933
What do you mean?

905
02:04:03,811 --> 02:04:06,020
He drove to his death.

906
02:04:11,110 --> 02:04:13,987
- He's finished.
- Are you positive?

907
02:04:17,533 --> 02:04:19,826
What the hell did you do?

908
02:04:21,704 --> 02:04:25,248
He died in a car accident.
We don't know anything. Okay?

909
02:04:34,383 --> 02:04:35,842
Blomkvist!

910
02:04:38,304 --> 02:04:41,473
- What the hell happened here?
- The cellar.

911
02:05:05,706 --> 02:05:07,749
What happened out there?

912
02:05:13,631 --> 02:05:15,423
He didn't die in an accident, did he?

913
02:05:20,012 --> 02:05:21,763
Damn, Lisbeth.

914
02:05:22,223 --> 02:05:26,768
His father taught him to kill
when he was 16 years old.

915
02:05:27,770 --> 02:05:30,772
That would make anybody
sick in the brain.

916
02:05:30,898 --> 02:05:35,068
Don't make him into a fucking victim.
He nearly killed you.

917
02:05:35,277 --> 02:05:37,987
He was a killer and a rapist
and he enjoyed it.

918
02:05:38,197 --> 02:05:42,492
He had the same chances as everyone
else. You choose who you want to be.

919
02:05:42,701 --> 02:05:46,996
He wasn't a victim. He was an
evil motherfucker who hated women.

920
02:05:52,211 --> 02:05:54,212
How did he die?

921
02:05:59,677 --> 02:06:01,344
He burned to death.

922
02:06:06,642 --> 02:06:09,644
- Could you have saved him?
- Yes.

923
02:06:10,312 --> 02:06:13,356
- But you let him burn.
- Yes.

924
02:06:58,944 --> 02:07:01,863
I would never have done that, Lisbeth.

925
02:07:03,741 --> 02:07:06,701
But I understand why you did it.

926
02:07:10,080 --> 02:07:12,832
I don't know what you've been through.

927
02:07:16,086 --> 02:07:19,172
But I almost died in that cellar -

928
02:07:20,591 --> 02:07:22,884
- and you saved my life.

929
02:07:28,891 --> 02:07:31,309
Whatever it is you've been through, -

930
02:07:33,896 --> 02:07:36,522
- you don't have to tell me.

931
02:07:40,277 --> 02:07:42,403
I'm just glad you're here.

932
02:07:53,874 --> 02:07:55,291
Thanks.

933
02:08:12,893 --> 02:08:15,645
For the first time in my life
I feel old.

934
02:08:28,951 --> 02:08:33,204
- We're not finished yet.
- What do you mean?

935
02:08:34,039 --> 02:08:38,251
- Harriet wasn't one of Martin's victims.
- What are you saying?

936
02:08:38,460 --> 02:08:41,170
Martin didn't kill Harriet.

937
02:08:49,972 --> 02:08:56,269
Lisbeth?

938
02:09:20,627 --> 02:09:24,964
Two women bear the name Anita Vanger.
One of them died in London.

939
02:09:25,007 --> 02:09:30,803
The other one lives in Australia.
First entry into the country in 1966.

940
02:10:40,457 --> 02:10:42,124
Harriet?

941
02:10:45,587 --> 02:11:00,101
Harriet Vanger?

942
02:11:02,104 --> 02:11:04,063
Everything's all right?

943
02:11:13,407 --> 02:11:18,369
Yes. You and your cousin babysat me
when I was a small boy.

944
02:11:21,123 --> 02:11:24,125
But I'm here on behalf of
Henrik Vanger.

945
02:11:37,806 --> 02:11:39,515
Does he know I'm alive?

946
02:11:44,354 --> 02:11:46,147
Not yet.

947
02:12:03,874 --> 02:12:06,292
I'm here to visit Agneta Salander.

948
02:12:06,543 --> 02:12:10,004
- Who can I say it is?
- Her daughter.

949
02:12:10,172 --> 02:12:13,591
Her daughter?
Are you Agneta's daughter?

950
02:12:15,802 --> 02:12:19,180
I'm sorry, it's just...
I've never seen you before.

951
02:12:57,678 --> 02:12:59,261
Hi, Mom.

952
02:13:02,891 --> 02:13:04,225
Mom?

953
02:13:06,895 --> 02:13:09,230
It's me. Lisbeth.

954
02:13:18,156 --> 02:13:19,907
Lisbeth...

955
02:13:28,291 --> 02:13:30,334
Are you Lisbeth?

956
02:13:32,254 --> 02:13:35,256
I wanted to come
a long time ago.

957
02:13:43,765 --> 02:13:46,142
You look so different now.

958
02:13:52,899 --> 02:13:56,277
- Do you have kids?
- No.

959
02:14:00,198 --> 02:14:02,116
A boyfriend?

960
02:14:06,997 --> 02:14:08,956
There is someone...

961
02:14:14,838 --> 02:14:17,339
...but you should never fall in love.

962
02:14:18,300 --> 02:14:21,010
You know that better than anyone.

963
02:14:26,224 --> 02:14:28,142
Right, Mom?

964
02:14:36,318 --> 02:14:39,320
I should have picked
a better father for you.

965
02:14:40,947 --> 02:14:45,159
Let it be, Mom.
It was you he harmed.

966
02:14:53,168 --> 02:14:54,794
Mom...

967
02:15:06,139 --> 02:15:07,890
Come in.

968
02:15:13,438 --> 02:15:16,357
Mikael. Welcome back.

969
02:15:19,027 --> 02:15:23,364
I've got a nice surprise. Promise me
you won't have a heart attack.

970
02:15:23,573 --> 02:15:27,660
With all the pills
I'm popping at the moment, -

971
02:15:27,869 --> 02:15:31,372
- I think it's physically impossible
to have a heart attack.

972
02:15:59,317 --> 02:16:01,110
Harriet?

973
02:16:22,924 --> 02:16:24,717
Forgive me.

974
02:16:35,437 --> 02:16:42,401
I'm sorry.

975
02:16:52,704 --> 02:16:56,457
I was 14 when Dad raped me
for the first time.

976
02:16:57,876 --> 02:17:00,920
A year later he took me
to his cottage.

977
02:17:03,256 --> 02:17:05,090
Then Martin joined in.

978
02:17:08,428 --> 02:17:13,474
They abused me again
several times after that.

979
02:17:17,437 --> 02:17:19,480
One day I'd had enough.

980
02:17:23,902 --> 02:17:26,487
Dad was drunk as usual.

981
02:17:34,621 --> 02:17:39,708
He reeled off Bible verses and boasted
about all the women he'd killed.

982
02:17:47,509 --> 02:17:50,302
I took the oar and hit him hard.

983
02:17:59,521 --> 02:18:03,065
I pressed him under the water
till it got still.

984
02:18:21,209 --> 02:18:24,670
Then I pushed the boat out
to make it look like an accident.

985
02:18:27,048 --> 02:18:29,508
But when I turned around...

986
02:18:32,387 --> 02:18:34,596
...Martin was there.

987
02:18:37,475 --> 02:18:40,602
Martin treated me even worse
than Gottfried.

988
02:18:41,938 --> 02:18:45,024
You sent him to a boarding school
in Uppsala, -

989
02:18:45,984 --> 02:18:48,694
- but on Children's Day
he came back.

990
02:18:50,864 --> 02:18:54,533
I was terrified
it would start all over again.

991
02:19:02,959 --> 02:19:05,294
And then you went to Anita?

992
02:19:06,087 --> 02:19:10,257
Anita helped me get out of here.

993
02:19:10,550 --> 02:19:14,803
When the bridge was opened,
she drove the car.

994
02:19:15,013 --> 02:19:19,516
I was in the back seat
under a blanket.

995
02:19:23,730 --> 02:19:26,607
I've been thinking of you
all these years.

996
02:19:26,733 --> 02:19:32,154
I sent you the framed flowers -

997
02:19:32,405 --> 02:19:36,408
- because I wanted to tell you
that I was out there somewhere.

998
02:19:39,287 --> 02:19:44,625
So I was sad to hear Mikael say
what you'd read into them.

999
02:19:45,627 --> 02:19:50,756
If you hadn't sent them,
you wouldn't be sitting here now.

1000
02:20:00,725 --> 02:20:02,309
No.

1001
02:20:18,827 --> 02:20:21,036
Lisbeth, it's me again.

1002
02:20:22,705 --> 02:20:25,040
Call me if you hear this.

1003
02:20:27,877 --> 02:20:31,713
I hope you're doing okay.
Call me.

1004
02:20:45,145 --> 02:20:46,520
You've got a visitor.

1005
02:20:47,147 --> 02:20:48,939
Thirty minutes.

1006
02:20:56,906 --> 02:20:59,324
I'm so happy to see you.

1007
02:21:06,458 --> 02:21:07,875
Here.

1008
02:21:08,626 --> 02:21:11,211
- What's this?
- A bit of reading.

1009
02:21:18,470 --> 02:21:22,764
- Don't you want to sit down?
- I just wanted to give you that.

1010
02:21:41,784 --> 02:21:44,578
I've only got
a month and a half left.

1011
02:22:15,360 --> 02:22:17,945
EVERYBODY'S GOT SECRETS

1012
02:23:00,822 --> 02:23:06,702
