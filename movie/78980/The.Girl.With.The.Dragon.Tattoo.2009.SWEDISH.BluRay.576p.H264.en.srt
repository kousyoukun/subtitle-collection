1
00:02:58,509 --> 00:03:02,455
Today they pass judgment
against the journalist

2
00:03:02,676 --> 00:03:07,831
and the responsible publisher
from Millennium, Mikael Blomkvist,

3
00:03:08,051 --> 00:03:10,835
who is accused for gross slander...

4
00:03:11,051 --> 00:03:14,997
of the successful financier
Hans-Erik Wennerström.

5
00:03:15,218 --> 00:03:20,717
Blomkvist accused of Wennerström
Illeagal arms trafficking and fraud

6
00:03:20,926 --> 00:03:23,130
over 60 million.

7
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:27,288
The Swedes have always had
divided opinions on Blomkvist.

8
00:03:27,509 --> 00:03:33,508
His supporters believe he is
the last idealistic journalist.

9
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:39,628
But now his long career as
journalistic watchdog may be over.

10
00:03:43,343 --> 00:03:48,000
In the case Wennerström Vs. Millennium
Is defendants Mikael Blomkvist declared

11
00:03:48,218 --> 00:03:51,630
guilty in six of eight allegations.

12
00:03:52,551 --> 00:03:56,130
The accused is sentenced
three months' imprisonment

13
00:03:56,343 --> 00:04:01,712
and a compensation of 150,000
dollars to Hans-Erik Wennerström.

14
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:08,794
How do you see the ruling?

15
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:12,173
We must stop people like Kalle Blomkvist

16
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:18,384
Digging in honest peoples cases simply
because do not agree with their views.

17
00:04:19,635 --> 00:04:25,299
- I have no further comment.
- There he comes.

18
00:04:25,510 --> 00:04:28,425
How is it to be declared guilty?

19
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:32,332
Will you continue as a
journalist Mikael Blomkvist?

20
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:37,999
- Cheers, everybody. God Jul.
- Cheers. God Jul.

21
00:04:38,218 --> 00:04:41,584
- Cheers.
- How do we appeal the ruling?

22
00:04:41,802 --> 00:04:45,381
We're behind you one
hundred percent, Micke.

23
00:04:45,593 --> 00:04:49,422
We must do something. The advertisers
have lost confidence in us.

24
00:04:49,635 --> 00:04:54,174
- We wont regain that with an appeal.
- An appeal would win us the time.

25
00:04:54,385 --> 00:04:57,917
- We will not appeal.
- This is about Millennium's future.

26
00:04:58,135 --> 00:05:02,129
The sooner this is over
the better for Millennium.

27
00:05:02,344 --> 00:05:05,211
Not to act as the Devil's advocate...

28
00:05:05,427 --> 00:05:10,380
but it is not an idea if
Mikael left Millennium?

29
00:05:10,594 --> 00:05:13,592
Just until the storm is over?

30
00:05:19,427 --> 00:05:21,085
Merry Christmas

31
00:05:26,469 --> 00:05:28,294
Wait Micke.

32
00:05:29,011 --> 00:05:32,672
- They are in shock.
- Only Janne dare speak the truth.

33
00:05:32,886 --> 00:05:37,211
- I am a liability for the magazine.
- It's about finding a way out.

34
00:05:37,427 --> 00:05:40,212
There are empty here.

35
00:05:40,427 --> 00:05:43,627
I have not written a
word for several months.

36
00:05:47,344 --> 00:05:49,335
Do you?

37
00:06:36,553 --> 00:06:40,049
Wennerström Delivers
a knockout to Blomkvist

38
00:06:47,428 --> 00:06:49,584
Jail!

39
00:06:56,595 --> 00:06:58,467
God damn!.

40
00:07:21,053 --> 00:07:25,378
It is rare that we show our
research for our clients.

41
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:28,066
But we have a special
relationship with your client,

42
00:07:28,067 --> 00:07:29,838
so we make an exception in this case.

43
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:33,170
- That we appreciate.
- I must warn you.

44
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:38,803
- Lisbeth is a special little girl.
- What do you mean by special?

45
00:07:39,012 --> 00:07:43,420
But make no mistake. She
is our very best researcher.

46
00:07:43,637 --> 00:07:46,090
Good morning, Lisbeth.

47
00:07:50,387 --> 00:07:52,792
Good morning.

48
00:07:53,012 --> 00:07:54,919
Dirch Frode.

49
00:08:18,846 --> 00:08:21,381
Prints of SMS.

50
00:08:21,596 --> 00:08:24,547
E-mail. Bank account overview.

51
00:08:26,012 --> 00:08:28,845
How do I get access to it?

52
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:32,005
You order the product.
I will deliver it.

53
00:08:35,888 --> 00:08:39,088
What can you tell me About Blomkvist?

54
00:08:39,304 --> 00:08:44,045
- Everything is in the report.
- The short version.

55
00:08:44,263 --> 00:08:47,379
Blomkvist got the
nickname Kalle Blomkvist...

56
00:08:47,596 --> 00:08:50,713
when he solved a bank
robbery in the 80s.

57
00:08:50,929 --> 00:08:56,428
A public person with no major
secrets. Read the newspaper articles.

58
00:08:56,638 --> 00:09:01,295
- But then he does have secrets?
- Everyone has secrets.

59
00:09:01,513 --> 00:09:06,051
How hard is he affected by
the crisis on Millennium?

60
00:09:06,263 --> 00:09:10,126
- Financially?
- Maybe you should read the report.

61
00:09:10,346 --> 00:09:13,961
Miss Salander, Do you
have anything to add?

62
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,884
Do you have any thoughts of your own?

63
00:09:19,096 --> 00:09:22,296
There is something odd
about the Wennerström case.

64
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:26,589
How so? Is there more in the case?

65
00:09:26,805 --> 00:09:30,170
I must examine him, not do his job.

66
00:09:30,388 --> 00:09:34,252
I would like to hear
your personal opinion.

67
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:38,761
Blomkvist is clean. Not one single
speeding ticket. I found nothing on him.

68
00:09:38,972 --> 00:09:42,503
I do not think he has
fabricated false evidence.

69
00:09:42,722 --> 00:09:44,842
Someone caught him in a trap.

70
00:09:47,097 --> 00:09:49,550
Why did you not ask me?

71
00:09:49,763 --> 00:09:54,220
- No lawyer could save me.
- I know. I have read the ruling.

72
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:57,298
I did not want to get you involved.

73
00:09:57,513 --> 00:10:01,756
But you could have asked
me. I am your sister.

74
00:10:01,972 --> 00:10:04,342
I know.

75
00:10:04,555 --> 00:10:08,134
I'm stuck in the shit. Why
drag the family down with me?

76
00:10:08,347 --> 00:10:11,547
And now your going to
jail. That is far out.

77
00:10:11,764 --> 00:10:17,763
The secret of good meatballs is that
you have to moisten your fingers.

78
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,676
And then rub your hands
against each other.

79
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:25,136
Shit. could you take this for me?

80
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,971
- Hello, this is Micke Blomkvist.
- Hey hey, your little terrorist.

81
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:35,427
- It's Mikael.
- Mikael Blomkvist?

82
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,846
- Yes. Who I am talking too?
- My name is Dirch Frode.

83
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:43,800
I am a lawyer. My client
would like to speak with you.

84
00:10:44,014 --> 00:10:48,173
- It is Christmas! Is it important?
- My client do not want to wait.

85
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:53,840
- Call Millennium after the New Year.
- My client does not want to wait.

86
00:10:54,056 --> 00:10:56,970
- Who is your client?
- Henrik Vanger.

87
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:59,634
From The Vanger Concern?

88
00:10:59,847 --> 00:11:03,295
My client would
appreciate it if you came.

89
00:11:03,514 --> 00:11:06,844
It is Christmas Eve. It
has been a horrible week.

90
00:11:07,056 --> 00:11:11,050
I promise you will find it interesting.

91
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:34,763
Blomkvist!

92
00:11:41,806 --> 00:11:47,092
Henrik lives on the island Hedeby,
A few kilometers from Hedestad.

93
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:59,585
The bridge here is the only
connection to the mainland.

94
00:12:11,473 --> 00:12:16,711
Once everyone came from the top of
Swedish business community to this estate.

95
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:21,174
Now, its only Henrik and the
housekeeper Anna, who lives here.

96
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,675
Thank you for coming, Mikael.

97
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:35,338
Frodes call was somewhat unusual.

98
00:12:36,848 --> 00:12:38,476
Are you hungry? There is lunch.

99
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:41,091
Otherwise, thank you.
Let's get down to business.

100
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:45,135
- I go home this afternoon.
- Then we skip lunch.

101
00:12:53,182 --> 00:12:55,587
Do you remember her?

102
00:12:56,765 --> 00:13:01,090
That is Harriet Vanger, my
brother Gottfrieds daughter.

103
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:05,263
You have met her.

104
00:13:05,474 --> 00:13:07,927
The girl here?

105
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,296
Your father worked
for me in summer 1965.

106
00:13:13,515 --> 00:13:18,220
He was a mechanical engineer in the
workshop and lived in one of our cabins.

107
00:13:19,432 --> 00:13:22,798
You and your mother came to visit

108
00:13:23,016 --> 00:13:25,220
at weekends.

109
00:13:26,099 --> 00:13:31,847
Harriet liked you. You often
played out there by the water.

110
00:13:35,932 --> 00:13:38,681
I remember her.

111
00:13:39,932 --> 00:13:43,973
- Harriet.
- I never got any children himself.

112
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:49,092
Harriet was my precious. She
was an incredibly smart girl.

113
00:13:49,307 --> 00:13:53,384
I looked at her like my own daughter.

114
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:58,426
What happened to her?

115
00:14:00,099 --> 00:14:04,508
- I think she was murdered.
- Murdered?

116
00:14:09,808 --> 00:14:15,010
This is family Vanger,
Mikael. My family.

117
00:14:16,099 --> 00:14:21,966
22. September 1966. Thet day the
whole family gathered in this house

118
00:14:22,183 --> 00:14:25,264
to the annual meeting.

119
00:14:25,475 --> 00:14:29,515
30 petty and greedy people

120
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:34,515
who fought over who would have
the largest piece of the cake.

121
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:37,178
One of these people...

122
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:42,552
...murdered Harriet.

123
00:14:44,141 --> 00:14:47,922
Harriet was 16 years.
It was Children's Day.

124
00:14:48,808 --> 00:14:53,549
She had been inside the Herdestad
to see the parade on the main street.

125
00:14:53,766 --> 00:14:57,630
That image was printed
in the local newspaper.

126
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:01,844
Around two she came back to the island.

127
00:15:02,058 --> 00:15:05,140
She wanted to talk to me
about something, but...

128
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:08,680
...I was busy with a board meeting.

129
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,469
How was she murdered?

130
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,056
Nobody knows. She just disappeared.

131
00:15:20,392 --> 00:15:22,631
You are well prepared.

132
00:15:24,183 --> 00:15:27,181
I have thought of that day in 40 years.

133
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,973
That you can call preparation.

134
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:37,808
Quarter past two, there was a serious
traffic accidents down on Hedeby Bridge.

135
00:15:38,559 --> 00:15:43,927
A tanker full of gasoline
collided with a car.

136
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:46,926
Truck was across the bridge.

137
00:15:47,142 --> 00:15:51,266
Tank leaked gasoline All over the place.

138
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:56,049
Nobody could get past. All
had to stay on the island.

139
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:59,763
By accident the photographer
captured it here.

140
00:16:00,934 --> 00:16:03,387
See up there at the curtain.

141
00:16:05,226 --> 00:16:08,922
It is the last picture made by Harriet.

142
00:16:10,017 --> 00:16:15,219
Commissioner Morell from Hot
Hedeby led the investigation.

143
00:16:15,434 --> 00:16:20,968
He took the film here and had
made Enlargements of this image.

144
00:16:21,184 --> 00:16:24,680
Since then, no-one have seen her.

145
00:16:26,642 --> 00:16:30,885
We waited for her at dinner,
but she never showed up.

146
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,798
- Hello?
- Lisbeth Salander?

147
00:16:37,018 --> 00:16:40,264
- Who is it?
- Svensson from the state administration.

148
00:16:40,476 --> 00:16:46,010
- You have a new guardian. Bjurman.
- I already have a guardian.

149
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:50,718
Your previous guardian was
hospitalized with a stroke,

150
00:16:50,934 --> 00:16:54,265
so I had to find you a new one.

151
00:16:55,351 --> 00:16:59,392
Good we could meet, though
it's Christmas, Sit down.

152
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:05,223
It is a bit unfortunate...

153
00:17:05,435 --> 00:17:11,016
that Palmgren has had such a
lax approach to guardianship law.

154
00:17:11,226 --> 00:17:15,054
I see you've managed your own economy.

155
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:19,890
- It has not been a problem.
- No, it probably is not.

156
00:17:20,101 --> 00:17:24,889
But as your guardian I am legally
and financially responsible.

157
00:17:25,101 --> 00:17:30,968
That means I get the blame if
you suddenly cannot pay rent.

158
00:17:31,185 --> 00:17:35,309
I have work. I earn my own money.

159
00:17:37,143 --> 00:17:42,014
Yes, you work for
Milton Security, I see...

160
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:47,475
- What are you there?
- I make coffee and photocopies.

161
00:17:50,768 --> 00:17:53,008
We do it this way:

162
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:57,718
From now on, your salary goes into
a new account, which I dispose over.

163
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:02,142
You get some pocket money every
month for personal expenses,

164
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:07,139
but all other expenses I
will have to accept. Okay?

165
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:17,059
How do you manage your personal hygiene?

166
00:18:17,269 --> 00:18:19,592
What do you mean?

167
00:18:19,810 --> 00:18:24,053
With all those rings. Don't you
get inflammation in the holes?

168
00:18:28,185 --> 00:18:30,259
Do you have a girlfriend?

169
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:33,095
No.

170
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:36,143
Have you ever had sexual intercourse?

171
00:18:37,269 --> 00:18:39,639
I am 24 years.

172
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:44,344
I can choose to write
that you are cooperating,

173
00:18:45,352 --> 00:18:48,718
or that you create problems
and is being troublesome.

174
00:18:49,852 --> 00:18:53,928
And then your life quickly
become very problematic.

175
00:18:55,602 --> 00:18:58,766
So how many have you had sex with?

176
00:19:01,686 --> 00:19:04,009
- Two.
- Two?

177
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,144
200. No, 2000.

178
00:19:08,352 --> 00:19:12,891
- 200,000. Are we finished?
- What kind of sex do you have?

179
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:17,932
Any special preferences?

180
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:24,643
Have you considered That
might just have left?

181
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:29,012
No, because of the accident. The
bridge was blocked for 24 hours.

182
00:19:29,228 --> 00:19:31,716
And it was the only way off the island.

183
00:19:31,936 --> 00:19:35,266
Harriet disappeared, while
no one could leave the island.

184
00:19:35,478 --> 00:19:40,550
The day after we thought
that it could be a crime.

185
00:19:40,769 --> 00:19:46,055
But then the bridge was open, and the
killer could have gotten rid of the body.

186
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,351
She may have drowned
have committed suicide.

187
00:19:49,561 --> 00:19:54,633
We searched after her. We put
dogs out and divers in the water.

188
00:19:54,853 --> 00:19:57,886
Even today, when I take a walk,

189
00:19:58,103 --> 00:20:01,516
I find myself looking for her.

190
00:20:03,686 --> 00:20:08,260
When Harriet was eight, She
gave me a birthday present.

191
00:20:08,478 --> 00:20:12,093
A bluebell from 1958.

192
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:16,175
Then she gave me a
new flower every year.

193
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:20,436
1966. The year when Harriet disappeared.

194
00:20:22,228 --> 00:20:24,799
We have to go to the attic.

195
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:43,594
Incredible.

196
00:20:43,812 --> 00:20:48,220
Every damn year, I get
a flower on my birthday

197
00:20:48,437 --> 00:20:51,885
from a new spot on the world map.

198
00:20:52,104 --> 00:20:56,263
- Who do you think you send them?
- Harriets murderer.

199
00:20:57,395 --> 00:21:01,638
You do not know my family. You do
not know what they are capable of.

200
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:09,635
I favored Harriet. It did
her an obvious victim for them

201
00:21:09,854 --> 00:21:13,433
Those who wanted more
power in The Vanger Concern.

202
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,843
They wanted to crush me.

203
00:21:19,062 --> 00:21:23,270
I am 82 years. The police
have since long given up.

204
00:21:23,479 --> 00:21:26,726
I end up going to the
grave without knowing.

205
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:29,971
Help me to make one last attempt.

206
00:21:30,187 --> 00:21:33,304
- Why just me?
- I have followed you.

207
00:21:33,521 --> 00:21:36,353
You are a good journalist. Stubborn.

208
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:41,019
I do not ask you to solve the
puzzle. Just make an attempt.

209
00:21:41,229 --> 00:21:45,472
There are half a year to
you must serve your sentence.

210
00:21:47,396 --> 00:21:49,552
You have devoted 40 years...

211
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:53,599
I will pay you a good fee.

212
00:21:53,813 --> 00:21:57,641
You will be wealthy.
You have nothing to lose.

213
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:02,344
You have nothing to
return to in Stockholm.

214
00:22:11,271 --> 00:22:16,473
"Blomkvist resigns from the Board
and works no longer for Millennium."

215
00:22:16,688 --> 00:22:21,345
Have you written the press release
without talking to me first?

216
00:22:23,605 --> 00:22:27,100
It is me who must take the decision.

217
00:22:32,063 --> 00:22:34,386
What happens now?

218
00:22:34,605 --> 00:22:39,677
I will work for Henrik Vanger in Hedeby.

219
00:22:41,021 --> 00:22:44,802
Aha. So now you work
for large capitalists.

220
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:49,013
It is not for The Vanger Concern.

221
00:22:53,147 --> 00:22:55,018
Are you going to live there?

222
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:58,601
In Hedeby?

223
00:23:06,688 --> 00:23:08,395
Good trip.

224
00:23:41,522 --> 00:23:45,468
CONNECTING BLOMKVIST

225
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:51,894
CONNECTION ACHIEVED FULL ACCESS

226
00:24:03,231 --> 00:24:05,801
NO NEW ACTIVITIES

227
00:24:18,439 --> 00:24:20,430
I'll crush you.

228
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:30,096
What are you looking at?

229
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:36,981
What the fuck are you doing, you pussy?

230
00:24:38,148 --> 00:24:40,814
The whore need to lie down.

231
00:24:47,023 --> 00:24:49,725
- Cunt!
- Down with her!

232
00:24:57,898 --> 00:25:01,559
- The bitch is crazy.
- Come again, pig!

233
00:25:02,898 --> 00:25:04,805
Come on.

234
00:25:20,273 --> 00:25:21,730
Shit.

235
00:25:23,023 --> 00:25:24,978
What did you say?

236
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:30,063
- I can save the hard disk.
- Good.

237
00:25:35,315 --> 00:25:37,471
And the rest?

238
00:25:40,523 --> 00:25:43,391
You need to go on sales hunting.

239
00:25:45,732 --> 00:25:49,476
- How did that happen?
- nevermind.

240
00:25:52,982 --> 00:25:57,853
- You stink of beer.
- And you just showered?

241
00:26:03,732 --> 00:26:06,303
You can borrow the desktop pc.

242
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:10,387
I use it for backup, so
it needs to stay here.

243
00:26:31,482 --> 00:26:33,638
Welcome to Hedeby.

244
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:37,721
Very refreshing with this cold weather.

245
00:26:37,941 --> 00:26:43,940
You did not want to live in the main
building, so I hope you'll like it here.

246
00:26:49,149 --> 00:26:52,977
If it gets colder,
The water pipes freeze.

247
00:26:53,191 --> 00:26:56,354
Then you must come up
to me and get water.

248
00:26:56,566 --> 00:27:00,725
Yes? Well, it is good.
Just put them here.

249
00:27:03,482 --> 00:27:09,100
It is part of the material
I've collected over the years.

250
00:27:10,233 --> 00:27:14,309
There are pictures. Police Reports.

251
00:27:15,358 --> 00:27:21,022
Newspaper. In addition some
of Harriets possessions.

252
00:27:23,691 --> 00:27:26,358
It is a start.

253
00:28:16,567 --> 00:28:19,233
You were a beautiful nanny.

254
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:42,020
What did you experience?

255
00:29:29,192 --> 00:29:31,562
Defending Swedens purity:

256
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:35,058
We are the Swedish national socialists.

257
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:39,767
Which the arian race can not do without:

258
00:29:49,484 --> 00:29:53,146
Family Vanger is a
pretty unpleasant bunch.

259
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:58,147
Most of us detest each other, but
are forced together by the company.

260
00:29:59,734 --> 00:30:02,934
In there lives my brother Harald.

261
00:30:03,151 --> 00:30:07,227
To put it mildly we do
not get along together.

262
00:30:08,901 --> 00:30:13,642
Your brothers Richard and Harald
was in a Nazi group in the 30s.

263
00:30:13,859 --> 00:30:18,067
Well, you know that already.

264
00:30:18,276 --> 00:30:21,310
Gottfried was in the Hitler Jugend.

265
00:30:22,276 --> 00:30:25,724
They were all three Nazis.

266
00:30:28,651 --> 00:30:31,021
Yes. Fanatical.

267
00:30:32,735 --> 00:30:35,898
Richard fell in The Finnish Winter War.

268
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:42,849
Harald has been a bitter, old man.
He never goes outside of a door.

269
00:30:44,818 --> 00:30:48,646
Harald's daughter Cecilia
Is in Scotland at the moment.

270
00:30:49,901 --> 00:30:52,734
Cecilia and Harald are
not on speaking terms.

271
00:31:00,277 --> 00:31:03,275
In there lives Martin,
Harriet's brother.

272
00:31:04,777 --> 00:31:08,605
He took over The
Vanger Concern after me.

273
00:31:08,818 --> 00:31:10,608
Hello.

274
00:31:10,818 --> 00:31:15,310
There you are. It is the
famous Kalle Blomkvist.

275
00:31:15,527 --> 00:31:18,276
Just call me Mikael.

276
00:31:18,485 --> 00:31:21,602
I am curious to hear why you want to...

277
00:31:21,818 --> 00:31:25,480
spend six months in
this godforsaken town.

278
00:31:27,985 --> 00:31:31,102
Martin and Harriet's father, Gottfried,

279
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:36,189
lived a miserable and alcoholized
live with his Isabella.

280
00:31:36,402 --> 00:31:41,557
I have never seen a woman be
as bad a mother as Isabella.

281
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:48,231
I intervened and took
care of Harriet and Martin.

282
00:31:50,694 --> 00:31:53,857
That was all the familie
members who live here.

283
00:31:54,069 --> 00:31:57,102
On the day itself there was even more.

284
00:31:57,319 --> 00:32:01,313
Cecilia's sister Anita,
who died of cancer.

285
00:32:01,527 --> 00:32:05,817
- Greger Vanger and Ulrika Vanger.
- Stop just a moment.

286
00:32:06,027 --> 00:32:08,397
Who do you suspect?

287
00:32:10,736 --> 00:32:12,810
None.

288
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:17,400
And everyone. That
is where you come in..

289
00:32:54,319 --> 00:32:58,893
Dear diary. Today I got this
book by my dear uncle Henrik.

290
00:32:59,111 --> 00:33:01,564
a nie, but busy man.

291
00:33:01,778 --> 00:33:05,902
He has finally come home from
his trip and gave me this book.

292
00:33:07,361 --> 00:33:12,433
I sit alone in my father's summer
house and write. Anita is coming soon.

293
00:34:11,404 --> 00:34:14,935
So that is you who pry
into the familys history?

294
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:18,187
Shit you scared me!

295
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,816
Cecilia Vanger. Henrik
said you were here.

296
00:34:23,029 --> 00:34:27,485
- Mikael Blomkvist.
- I know you from the newspapers.

297
00:34:27,695 --> 00:34:30,895
- What have you there?
- Harriets bible.

298
00:34:32,362 --> 00:34:35,147
She was often here with my sister.

299
00:34:35,362 --> 00:34:37,068
- Anita?
- Yes.

300
00:34:37,279 --> 00:34:40,442
The last summer before she disappeared.

301
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:45,644
- Strange, since her father died here.
- Gottfried died here?

302
00:34:46,737 --> 00:34:51,359
He got really durnk and fell in the
lake. They found him the next morning.

303
00:34:51,571 --> 00:34:54,355
Down at by the bridge.

304
00:34:57,487 --> 00:35:00,983
This happened years
before Harriet disappeared.

305
00:35:01,196 --> 00:35:03,601
Henrik said you were abroad.

306
00:35:03,821 --> 00:35:08,359
I had to come home
to hide Harriets body.

307
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:13,643
We were not allowed to go here when
we were small. It was forbidden.

308
00:35:16,154 --> 00:35:17,612
Thank you.

309
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:25,070
Dear diary. It is autumn.
The weather has been colder.

310
00:35:26,863 --> 00:35:29,268
Magda 30112.

311
00:35:30,113 --> 00:35:32,779

314
00:35:41,571 --> 00:35:44,688
32018. Mari

315
00:35:44,905 --> 00:35:48,270
I do not understand
why Henrik hired you.

316
00:35:49,613 --> 00:35:52,813
Me neither, to be honest.

317
00:35:53,030 --> 00:35:58,315
With all due respect: There is nothing
to find. Its almost 40 years ago.

318
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,061
I found Harriets diary
in her father's cottage.

319
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:07,400
- Yes, but the journal did not help us.
- What with the five phone numbers?

320
00:36:07,613 --> 00:36:11,393
- The phone numbers was a big mystery.
- But 32 is...

321
00:36:11,613 --> 00:36:15,477
32 can be Hedenstad. 30
is Norrbyns area code.

322
00:36:15,697 --> 00:36:18,778
But the names and numbers do not match.

323
00:36:18,988 --> 00:36:22,934
- Did you ring the numbers?
- We rang. Tried them backwards.

324
00:36:23,155 --> 00:36:28,227
Swapped them, took numbers
out. We tried everything.

325
00:36:28,447 --> 00:36:32,985
The report describes her as
introverted and religious.

326
00:36:33,197 --> 00:36:35,567
Was that also your impression?

327
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:39,560
Who is not introvert as a teenager?

328
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:45,564
But yes, she stayed for herself.
Anita, her cousin, knew her best.

329
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:49,774
Anita is Cecilia Vangers
sister. And Anita is dead.

330
00:36:49,989 --> 00:36:53,271
She died many years ago.

331
00:36:54,530 --> 00:36:57,315
Harriet was my first case.

332
00:36:57,530 --> 00:37:01,524
I have thought about the case
every day for almost 40 years.

333
00:37:01,739 --> 00:37:07,072
I retire this summer. It
is only now I can let it go.

334
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:10,608
There is no answer.

335
00:37:10,822 --> 00:37:15,112
You gain nothing but keeping
Henriks obsession alive.

336
00:37:17,197 --> 00:37:20,942
Drop the case Before you
become obsessed with it.

337
00:38:53,532 --> 00:38:56,198
What are you working on?

338
00:38:57,365 --> 00:39:01,489
plague calling WAsP.
Plague calling WAsP.

339
00:39:02,323 --> 00:39:04,195
Hello.

340
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:27,562
- Who is this week's victim?
- No one.

341
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,197
Still that journalist? I thought
you were finished with him.

342
00:39:39,490 --> 00:39:42,192
Why do you keep on?

343
00:39:42,865 --> 00:39:45,568
Yes, it is a bit slow.

344
00:39:50,199 --> 00:39:52,320
A new computer?

345
00:39:52,532 --> 00:39:58,529
- Yes, I need 20,000.
- Why do you need a PC for 20.000?

346
00:39:58,741 --> 00:40:03,611
- Game, surf the Internet.
- Do you surf the Internet a lot?

347
00:40:05,449 --> 00:40:07,523
Do you chat?

348
00:40:17,407 --> 00:40:19,813
You know, Lisbeth?

349
00:40:21,991 --> 00:40:25,154
I can not just give you 20,000.

350
00:40:26,408 --> 00:40:29,571
- Not just like that.
- How hard can it be?

351
00:40:29,783 --> 00:40:32,816
Why can I not manage my account?

352
00:40:34,949 --> 00:40:37,438
Hit again. Do it now.

353
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:41,399
That is what you want, right? Hit me.

354
00:40:42,158 --> 00:40:45,903
If there are problems with
you I will arrange for you

355
00:40:46,116 --> 00:40:48,984
are cooped up the rest of your life.

356
00:40:49,199 --> 00:40:54,568
I know all about your mental
problems and violent background.

357
00:40:58,991 --> 00:41:01,396
Understand me right, Lisbeth...

358
00:41:04,366 --> 00:41:07,697
I would like to give you the 20.000.

359
00:41:08,825 --> 00:41:13,696
But you know that any trade...

360
00:41:14,825 --> 00:41:18,984
is based on trust. I have
to feel that I can trust you.

361
00:41:20,533 --> 00:41:22,607
Can I do that, sweetheart?

362
00:41:26,116 --> 00:41:28,949
Can I trust you, Lisbeth?

363
00:41:45,367 --> 00:41:47,571
Can I trust you?

364
00:42:02,575 --> 00:42:04,980
If you're nice to me...

365
00:42:07,117 --> 00:42:11,442
If you're nice to me I
will always be nice to you.

366
00:42:54,784 --> 00:42:58,481
- It's only 7.000.
- More than enough for a computer.

367
00:43:19,368 --> 00:43:21,654
What are you looking at?

368
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:02,150
You said it was the
newspaper's photographer,

369
00:44:02,151 --> 00:44:04,531
who took pictures of
the children's parade.

370
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:07,943
Yes, both that and the traffic accident.

371
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:11,526
The old part of the
archive is very messy.

372
00:44:11,743 --> 00:44:17,692
We have not scanned it electronically, so
everything is still in negative folders.

373
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:20,612
20... 30...

374
00:44:21,952 --> 00:44:25,152
...40, 50, 60...

375
00:44:25,368 --> 00:44:28,816
A photographer will take between
two and ten rolls in one day.

376
00:44:29,035 --> 00:44:32,199
Closer to ten, when we were
talking about childrens Day.

377
00:44:32,410 --> 00:44:34,733
Here. September 1966.

378
00:44:34,952 --> 00:44:38,448
I will only need the
hour, of the procession.

379
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:41,658
- Knock yourself out.
- Is it not sorted?

380
00:44:41,869 --> 00:44:45,530
If you are lucky, they
are roughly chronological.

381
00:44:45,744 --> 00:44:49,689
Do you have a negative
scanner and a light table?

382
00:46:40,578 --> 00:46:43,991
This is the first trace
in the case in 39 years.

383
00:46:44,203 --> 00:46:46,573
It is a start.

384
00:46:49,203 --> 00:46:51,526
It is more than that.

385
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:55,572
See there.

386
00:46:55,787 --> 00:46:59,069
Thinking about the same as I?

387
00:46:59,287 --> 00:47:03,576
What is it that caught her
eye? What is she afraid of?

388
00:47:04,745 --> 00:47:06,487
Her murderer.

389
00:47:08,037 --> 00:47:11,983
Aabout here on the other
side of the street...

390
00:47:14,287 --> 00:47:16,775
Is Harriets murderer.

391
00:47:34,912 --> 00:47:39,902
- Coffee, Mikael?
- What have you found out?

392
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,367
I must have read...

393
00:47:44,620 --> 00:47:49,029
several thousand pages. People
have been on the case for 40 years.

394
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:54,404
To be quite honest,

395
00:47:56,329 --> 00:47:59,362
I have not found anything.

396
00:48:02,621 --> 00:48:07,159
Should you not be in Stockholm
and try to appeal your conviction?

397
00:48:07,371 --> 00:48:10,783
- Leave it.
- No you leave it.

398
00:48:10,996 --> 00:48:15,120
- Mikael is old enough to...
- I was lured into a trap.

399
00:48:17,079 --> 00:48:21,985
One of my old classmates gave
me a tip on Wennerströms company.

400
00:48:22,204 --> 00:48:26,660
It was a good story.
Good enough to trap him.

401
00:48:26,871 --> 00:48:29,075
You would think.

402
00:48:29,288 --> 00:48:33,577
Yes, for suddenly there was
an even better history of fraud

403
00:48:33,788 --> 00:48:37,153
and arms trade for 60 million.

404
00:48:37,371 --> 00:48:41,993
Wennerströms name appeared
everywhere. So far so good.

405
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:47,779
So I wrote the story. The
all my sources dissapeared.

406
00:48:47,996 --> 00:48:52,156
And all documents and evidence
proved to be fabricated.

407
00:48:52,371 --> 00:48:54,113
Counterfeit?

408
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:58,074
It was too lure you
away from the real story?

409
00:48:58,288 --> 00:49:01,535
It was too good to be true.

410
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:07,487
do you want something, that
is really too good to be true?

411
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:15,991
Single malt. 21 years old.

412
00:49:17,913 --> 00:49:22,156
To hell with the past
mischief. Cheers to you.

413
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:24,741
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

414
00:49:42,997 --> 00:49:47,239
You... Should we take
one last glass of wine?

415
00:49:52,788 --> 00:49:55,656
I had enough.

416
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,526
- Thank you for a pleasant evening.
- Because of the investigation?

417
00:50:02,747 --> 00:50:05,531
My secretive family?

418
00:50:05,747 --> 00:50:10,488
- What do you mean?
- It could be me. right?

419
00:50:10,705 --> 00:50:14,486
I am also on your list of suspects.

420
00:50:39,289 --> 00:50:41,991
- Bjurman.
- It is Lisbeth.

421
00:50:42,206 --> 00:50:45,986
- What do you want?
- I need more money.

422
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:51,028
- That we can talk about.
- I need them now.

423
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:00,162
Welcome.

424
00:51:03,664 --> 00:51:06,153
Come in and take off your jacket.

425
00:51:09,248 --> 00:51:13,490
- I just need my money.
- You'll get your money.

426
00:51:13,706 --> 00:51:17,036
Thank you for last time. I
hope you also had a nice time.

427
00:51:17,248 --> 00:51:20,993
I will not suck cock every
time I need the money.

428
00:51:21,206 --> 00:51:24,868
Oh you will not? What
would you want to do then?

429
00:51:26,414 --> 00:51:29,910
Should I call to social services and say

430
00:51:30,123 --> 00:51:34,330
you're breaking into my home and
exhibits threatening behavior?

431
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:39,114
Then we see how fast you can go
back to the psychiatric hospital.

432
00:51:48,665 --> 00:51:50,786
What say you?

433
00:52:24,707 --> 00:52:26,614
That was better.

434
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:32,996
There you go.

435
00:52:34,165 --> 00:52:36,037
Come here.

436
00:52:38,124 --> 00:52:39,830
Come on.

437
00:53:01,749 --> 00:53:03,407
No!

438
00:53:58,666 --> 00:54:02,660
I have a... rule you need to learn.

439
00:54:02,874 --> 00:54:05,410
If you resist, then...

440
00:54:05,624 --> 00:54:09,369
Are you sweet? Are you sweet now?

441
00:58:00,919 --> 00:58:02,874
NORSJÖ carpentry

442
00:58:07,044 --> 00:58:08,999
NORSJÖ carpentry

443
00:58:38,586 --> 00:58:42,959
My husband died many years
ago. There is only me here.

444
00:58:44,461 --> 00:58:47,992
He worked in the carpentry for 24 years.

445
00:58:48,211 --> 00:58:53,082
They did everything from
clothes pegs to Wardrobes.

446
00:58:53,294 --> 00:58:57,584
He has done the cupboard
there. And the lamp, of course.

447
00:59:01,128 --> 00:59:02,869
More cake?

448
00:59:03,086 --> 00:59:07,743
Do you remember whether you
were in Hedeby in September 1966?

449
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:09,833
Hedeby...

450
00:59:10,044 --> 00:59:12,877
- In 66...
- Yes, 66

451
00:59:17,919 --> 00:59:22,742
- That was our honeymoon.
- How nice. Do you have pictures from it?

452
00:59:22,961 --> 00:59:26,161
We camped. It was the latest fashion.

453
00:59:27,669 --> 00:59:31,478
It was our best trip together.

454
00:59:31,779 --> 00:59:34,792
Honeymoons often is.

455
00:59:35,003 --> 00:59:39,541
- But you have some pictures?
- Yes, I have them.

456
00:59:41,170 --> 00:59:45,294
Who does not store images
from their honeymoon?

457
00:59:47,795 --> 00:59:51,456
On the first part of the journey
we walked in the mountains.

458
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:56,410
My husband had always walked a
lot. So it was some long walks.

459
00:59:56,628 --> 00:59:59,958
He was not exactly romantic.

460
01:00:00,920 --> 01:00:02,745
Now let's see.

461
01:00:03,837 --> 01:00:06,123
Hedeby...

462
01:00:08,253 --> 01:00:12,377
See there. How beautiful.

463
01:00:12,587 --> 01:00:16,995
Although the image does
not do the sunset justice.

464
01:00:17,212 --> 01:00:20,328
Now let's see. Here's something.

465
01:00:20,545 --> 01:00:23,709
- There was a parade.
- Did you?

466
01:00:43,129 --> 01:00:46,660
What the hell are you doing
here? I was on the way out.

467
01:00:46,879 --> 01:00:51,619
You have misunderstood the rules.
You must agree with me when you come.

468
01:00:52,545 --> 01:00:54,204
Do you hear me?

469
01:01:29,212 --> 01:01:31,666
Let me go.

470
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:36,416
Do you hear me? Let me go!

471
01:01:37,379 --> 01:01:39,868
Do you like being tied?

472
01:01:42,379 --> 01:01:46,953
Or does it turn you on tying others?

473
01:02:06,504 --> 01:02:08,495
Super nice.

474
01:02:08,713 --> 01:02:12,576
Have you chosen that
yourself? You did not chose it?

475
01:02:13,755 --> 01:02:16,041
I think it is nice.

476
01:02:41,672 --> 01:02:43,168
Have you seen the program

477
01:02:43,169 --> 01:02:46,578
in which politicians were
filmed with a hidden cameras?

478
01:02:46,797 --> 01:02:52,461
We have those cameras at my work.
I had one in the bag last time.

479
01:02:52,672 --> 01:02:55,207
Welcome.

480
01:02:57,255 --> 01:03:00,585
I thought I had to blow you.

481
01:03:00,797 --> 01:03:03,629
But you are sicker, than I thought.

482
01:03:03,838 --> 01:03:08,910
The products a couple of hours. Think about
what the police and the media would say.

483
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:10,920
Enjoy.

484
01:03:11,130 --> 01:03:14,543
Thanks for last time. I hope
you also had a good time.

485
01:03:14,755 --> 01:03:18,535
I will not suck cock every
time I need the money.

486
01:03:18,755 --> 01:03:22,251
Oh you will not? What
would you like to do?

487
01:03:58,756 --> 01:04:02,915
Now I will tell you, how we
are doing. You nodd in response.

488
01:04:04,589 --> 01:04:09,709
I dispose of my own account.
You no longer have access.

489
01:04:09,922 --> 01:04:12,790
I dispose of my own money.

490
01:04:16,173 --> 01:04:18,128
Is that understood?

491
01:04:18,339 --> 01:04:23,376
Every month you write in a
report I behave myself exemplary.

492
01:04:23,589 --> 01:04:25,912
Better than ever.

493
01:04:26,131 --> 01:04:31,500
In exactly a year you apply for
getting my guardianship terminated.

494
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:34,712
There will be a mail with instructions.

495
01:04:36,631 --> 01:04:39,001
You should never contact me.

496
01:04:39,214 --> 01:04:43,788
If you do, I send copies of the film
to the police and all the newspapers.

497
01:04:44,714 --> 01:04:48,162
The same happens If
I have an accident...

498
01:04:48,381 --> 01:04:51,663
or you break my rules.

499
01:04:51,881 --> 01:04:54,998
Is that understood?

500
01:05:07,881 --> 01:05:11,875
I have never tried it before. Lie
still, otherwise you make a mess.

501
01:05:18,173 --> 01:05:20,164
Lie still.

502
01:05:58,340 --> 01:06:02,665
I am a sadistic PIG AND A rapist

503
01:06:23,466 --> 01:06:27,590
FIND BLOMKVIST LABTOP
CONNECTING BLOMKVIST

SEND

507
01:07:55,841 --> 01:08:00,795
This guy in the blue sweater.
I can not get him sharper.

508
01:08:01,008 --> 01:08:05,168
I can not do a damn
thing. It is crazy blurred.

509
01:08:05,383 --> 01:08:09,211
- Are you sure?
- Completely sure. I have tried everything.

510
01:08:09,425 --> 01:08:12,672
Well, thanks for the
help. Talk to you later.

511
01:08:24,425 --> 01:08:27,458
WAsP... Harriet phone numbers.

512
01:08:29,383 --> 01:08:33,247
Read it here and you will
cringe, Kalle Blomkvist...

513
01:08:39,092 --> 01:08:42,007
Leviticus...

514
01:09:09,384 --> 01:09:13,330
"If a woman comes an animal near..."

515
01:09:13,551 --> 01:09:17,959
"...for them to mate, you must
kill both the woman and the animal."

516
01:09:18,176 --> 01:09:20,878
"They must suffer death."

517
01:09:21,092 --> 01:09:24,256
32018. Mari

518
01:09:26,092 --> 01:09:28,546
Magda 30112.

519
01:09:28,759 --> 01:09:32,006
Leviticus, Chapter 1, verse 12

520
01:09:32,217 --> 01:09:35,050
"... she shall take two doves

521
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:38,838
one for burn victim and the
other for a sin sacrifice."

522
01:09:39,051 --> 01:09:41,290
BJ 32027.

523
01:09:41,509 --> 01:09:44,128
"When a man or woman..."

524
01:09:44,343 --> 01:09:48,288
"When a man or woman have a
deadcallers spirit in themselves

525
01:09:48,509 --> 01:09:51,709
they shall suffer death.
I will stone them."

526
01:09:54,718 --> 01:09:57,171
They must suffer death.

527
01:10:10,176 --> 01:10:12,629
Frode! What happened?

528
01:10:12,843 --> 01:10:16,374
It is Henrik. He suddenly fell down.

529
01:10:16,593 --> 01:10:19,757
We return, when we know more.

530
01:10:27,801 --> 01:10:31,463
It is a heart attack.
They operate on him.

531
01:10:32,593 --> 01:10:37,665
- What are the prospects?
- They talk about bypass. This is serious.

532
01:10:42,177 --> 01:10:45,009
- Want a coffee?
- No.

533
01:10:49,635 --> 01:10:52,668
You must continue the investigation.

534
01:10:52,885 --> 01:10:56,333
- Have you put more on the task?
- No, it is only you.

535
01:10:56,552 --> 01:11:01,588
Then there is someone named WAsP
who hacking into my computer.

536
01:11:01,802 --> 01:11:06,708
I have received a mail with a
copie of one of my own documents.

537
01:11:07,885 --> 01:11:11,831
So he has been on my hard drive.

538
01:11:14,635 --> 01:11:17,088
Do you know anything about it?

539
01:11:22,219 --> 01:11:24,126
No.

540
01:11:24,344 --> 01:11:27,674
No, but I have a guess

541
01:11:27,885 --> 01:11:30,718
whom it can be.

542
01:11:57,552 --> 01:11:59,709
You just sleep on.

543
01:12:03,969 --> 01:12:06,209
Lisbeth Salander?

544
01:12:06,427 --> 01:12:09,710
- Who are you?
- You know that. Can I come in?

545
01:12:14,761 --> 01:12:18,257
I have read your
report. Exciting reading.

546
01:12:18,469 --> 01:12:23,173
You gained illegally access into my
files. It would interest the police.

547
01:12:23,386 --> 01:12:28,339
Like the fact that you still
hacke your way into my computer.

548
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:39,799
If you remove that folder
I'll remove the chain.

549
01:12:51,095 --> 01:12:52,836
What do you want?

550
01:12:56,678 --> 01:12:59,510
- Hi.
- All right?

551
01:13:08,095 --> 01:13:11,792
- What do you want?
- Is there coffee in the jug?

552
01:13:35,137 --> 01:13:37,886
How much do you know about my job?

553
01:13:38,095 --> 01:13:41,128
A 40-year murder on
a 16-year-old girl.

554
01:13:43,053 --> 01:13:46,715
Until today I was not sure
that that she was murdered.

555
01:13:46,928 --> 01:13:50,259
Then you showed me that
it was the bible quotes...

556
01:13:50,470 --> 01:13:53,219
on women to be killed.

557
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:57,967
- And?
- It is the main trail so far.

558
01:14:01,304 --> 01:14:04,634
- And?
- I need your help.

559
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:10,170
- You will be well paid.
- I have a job.

560
01:14:10,387 --> 01:14:13,587
You work as a professional hacker,

561
01:14:13,804 --> 01:14:17,667
but send me a mail you know I can track.

562
01:14:21,012 --> 01:14:22,671
Why?

563
01:14:28,387 --> 01:14:30,295
What?

564
01:15:05,971 --> 01:15:08,294
But he survives?

565
01:15:12,971 --> 01:15:15,092
Can he have visitors?

566
01:15:17,429 --> 01:15:19,883
Lisbeth Salander is here.

567
01:15:26,971 --> 01:15:30,171
It is good Frode. We
talk to you. Thank you.

568
01:15:47,138 --> 01:15:49,970
If a woman an animal comes near...

569
01:15:51,930 --> 01:15:57,002
I assume that you are updated.
We have shared files lately.

570
01:15:57,222 --> 01:15:58,762
Yes.

571
01:16:02,472 --> 01:16:07,129
You... What if the quotations do
not have a thing to do with God?

572
01:16:07,347 --> 01:16:09,965
If it is a kind of code?

573
01:16:10,180 --> 01:16:13,759
"Sara Witt was found found
murdered in the family byre

574
01:16:13,972 --> 01:16:16,839
outside of Vilhelmina in 1962."

575
01:16:17,055 --> 01:16:19,425
Sara? What else doe sit say?

576
01:16:19,638 --> 01:16:24,095
"Between two and three o'clock at
night the victim was lured out..."

577
01:16:26,013 --> 01:16:31,050
"The young woman's body was mutilate,
possibly after a religious ritual.

578
01:16:31,264 --> 01:16:33,834
Police would not disclose details. "

579
01:16:34,055 --> 01:16:38,263
Mutilated, possibly religious...
Was the killer found?

580
01:16:41,722 --> 01:16:45,218
No. The case was never solved.

581
01:16:47,555 --> 01:16:51,549
- It's a shot in the dark.
- I know.

582
01:16:51,764 --> 01:16:56,468
- How far is it to Vilhelmina?
- A bit too far on a motorcycle.

583
01:17:15,722 --> 01:17:17,843
What are we waiting for?

584
01:17:18,056 --> 01:17:20,923
- Do you want to drive?
- Why?

585
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:25,137
I have not driven since the divorce.

586
01:17:25,347 --> 01:17:27,918
Then it is about time.

587
01:17:47,806 --> 01:17:50,970
Female Names always leads to pornosites.

588
01:17:51,181 --> 01:17:53,255
What are you doing?

589
01:17:54,514 --> 01:17:59,337
Sets the computer to search
through some newspaper databases.

590
01:18:43,473 --> 01:18:46,140
We should be in the cowshed.

591
01:18:49,432 --> 01:18:55,096
They could not sell the farm after the
murder. It has stood empty since then.

592
01:18:59,223 --> 01:19:01,380
She was found here?

593
01:19:01,598 --> 01:19:06,303
Yes. Her husband found her.
Terrible for him. Terrible.

594
01:19:08,849 --> 01:19:11,135
It was here she was.

595
01:19:14,057 --> 01:19:19,259
In her crib. Curbed and beaten.

596
01:19:28,932 --> 01:19:31,551
Animals were also abused?

597
01:19:32,639 --> 01:19:35,175
How did you know?

598
01:19:37,598 --> 01:19:40,596
"If a woman an animal comes near...

599
01:19:40,806 --> 01:19:44,136
...you must kill both woman and animal."

600
01:19:47,306 --> 01:19:50,387
- It may be a coincidence.
- Yes.

601
01:19:54,806 --> 01:19:57,176
Damn da, Lisbeth.

602
01:19:59,348 --> 01:20:01,837
If the other also fits...

603
01:20:08,848 --> 01:20:12,261
I have found an old television program.

604
01:20:14,390 --> 01:20:18,549
A program from 1999
about a murder in Dalarna.

605
01:20:18,765 --> 01:20:23,339
"In the series' Swedish murders 'we
have come to Magda Lovisa Sjöberg

606
01:20:23,557 --> 01:20:25,926
from Dalarna. "

607
01:20:26,140 --> 01:20:27,965
Magda...

608
01:20:28,182 --> 01:20:32,756
"A cruel murder mystery, which caused
police problems in November 1954. "

609
01:20:32,973 --> 01:20:37,761
- Had we not a Magda-quote? -
Leviticus, Chapter 1, verse 12

610
01:20:37,973 --> 01:20:41,256
"So he cut it out also head and suet,

611
01:20:41,473 --> 01:20:46,463
and the priest shall put it on
the wood over a fire on the altar."

612
01:20:46,682 --> 01:20:48,921
That was literally.

613
01:20:51,307 --> 01:20:54,091
It was quoted word by word.

614
01:21:07,349 --> 01:21:12,469
So as far as I know, they found
Magdas body after six hours.

615
01:21:12,682 --> 01:21:15,929
There was a farmer who saw
the smoke from the fire.

616
01:21:16,140 --> 01:21:19,506
He thought it was a party.

617
01:21:21,099 --> 01:21:24,630
Someone has cut the fat from the body.

618
01:21:26,682 --> 01:21:32,300
Yes, that is true. they found
residues of fat along with the head.

619
01:21:33,682 --> 01:21:35,839
Discusting.

620
01:22:16,016 --> 01:22:19,678
What the hell are you doing? Relax now.

621
01:22:19,891 --> 01:22:23,173
I wanted to wake you. We are there now.

622
01:22:38,391 --> 01:22:40,299
Can I come in?

623
01:22:43,933 --> 01:22:46,089
Here's your bag.

624
01:22:52,683 --> 01:22:55,053
Are you okay?

625
01:22:56,225 --> 01:22:58,381
Yes, I am okay.

626
01:23:32,559 --> 01:23:35,805
I can not find anyone who fits BJ.

627
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:40,301
But LI can be Liv Ingvartsson.

628
01:23:40,517 --> 01:23:44,842
A prostitute who disappeared in Ånge
and showed up at a construction site.

629
01:23:45,059 --> 01:23:47,133
What was the quote?

630
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:51,723
...take two doves, one for Burn
victim, the other for a sin sacrifice.

631
01:23:51,934 --> 01:23:56,058
The priest clean her sins; she's clean.

632
01:23:56,267 --> 01:24:00,047
It is some way back where we come from.

633
01:24:07,184 --> 01:24:11,391
I think I have found one to.
17-year-old girl from Uppsala.

634
01:24:11,601 --> 01:24:14,515
- When?
- 1964.

635
01:24:14,726 --> 01:24:19,928
"The Mari murder desert the
streets." "Murderer still at large."

636
01:24:21,976 --> 01:24:23,433
There.

637
01:24:25,934 --> 01:24:30,141
Now we have Sara, Mari,
Magda and Liv. Four murders.

638
01:24:30,351 --> 01:24:33,302
So we just have BJ, which is circled.

639
01:24:33,518 --> 01:24:36,136
Harriet did not known them.

640
01:24:36,351 --> 01:24:42,051
LiV was murdered in 1949. Harriet was
born in 1950. So what's the connection?

641
01:24:43,101 --> 01:24:46,265
She made a list of
murders and disappeared.

642
01:24:46,476 --> 01:24:50,635
- Harriet knew who the murderer was.
- Yes.

643
01:25:07,393 --> 01:25:09,881
What is it?

644
01:25:10,101 --> 01:25:12,305
There have been someone.

645
01:25:15,268 --> 01:25:20,009
The images are different.
Bible was in a different way.

646
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:25,719
- See for yourself.
- What the hell?

647
01:25:26,518 --> 01:25:29,469
There is someone who is curious.

648
01:25:39,602 --> 01:25:42,268
I buy a new lock tomorrow.

649
01:25:54,893 --> 01:25:58,722
Lisbeth... you have photographic memory?

650
01:26:15,727 --> 01:26:19,093
Sorry. I will not make you regret it.

651
01:26:19,310 --> 01:26:23,802
It is great if you have
it. I wish I had it.

652
01:26:50,894 --> 01:26:54,591
Shut up, You scared me.

653
01:26:54,811 --> 01:26:56,683
Whats the problem?

654
01:27:02,936 --> 01:27:05,140
What are you doing?

655
01:27:22,478 --> 01:27:24,883
Is this a good idea?

656
01:28:17,687 --> 01:28:19,843
- Are you leaving?
- Good night.

657
01:28:41,228 --> 01:28:43,682
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

658
01:29:06,645 --> 01:29:08,850
Did you sleep well?

659
01:29:22,479 --> 01:29:25,167
I will visit Henrik.
Do you wan to come along?

660
01:29:25,468 --> 01:29:26,686
I hate hospitals.

661
01:29:32,354 --> 01:29:35,767
That is... That is completely absurd.

662
01:29:37,812 --> 01:29:42,102
you have found out more
than I had dared hope for.

663
01:29:43,021 --> 01:29:45,723
Use your energy to get better.

664
01:29:47,937 --> 01:29:50,391
I will keep you informed.

665
01:29:50,604 --> 01:29:54,183
Regarding the last
quote... The last name.

666
01:29:54,396 --> 01:29:57,927
- BJ.
- Ask Morell, if he can help.

667
01:30:03,313 --> 01:30:05,599
Morell!

668
01:30:09,021 --> 01:30:12,054
Damn to hell! Five murders!

669
01:30:14,271 --> 01:30:19,426
- It was not phone numbers.
- It was not me who discovered it.

670
01:30:20,605 --> 01:30:23,437
We have not found the last BJ.

671
01:30:23,646 --> 01:30:28,683
There are ring as if she is
important. It is the last quote.

672
01:30:28,896 --> 01:30:33,684
Is there a woman with those initials,
who died between 1940 and 1969,

673
01:30:33,896 --> 01:30:38,849
we must find her. Do
you know what this means?

674
01:30:39,063 --> 01:30:41,812
If the first murders occurred in 1949

675
01:30:42,021 --> 01:30:45,352
is the man that sends
Henrik flowers old.

676
01:30:45,563 --> 01:30:49,142
This limits the number
of suspects considerably.

677
01:31:13,188 --> 01:31:17,597
Mikael. It is good you
could come. Welcome.

678
01:31:17,813 --> 01:31:21,510
Harald could not come. He is hunting.

679
01:31:24,772 --> 01:31:30,223
- What do I owe the honor?
- Did you read the local newspaper recently?

680
01:31:30,439 --> 01:31:32,892
I have been away.

681
01:31:33,105 --> 01:31:37,348
They bring a very exciting serial

682
01:31:37,564 --> 01:31:39,969
about your exile in Hedeby.

683
01:31:40,189 --> 01:31:43,222
BLOMKVISTS NEW YOUNG GIRLFRIEND

684
01:31:45,855 --> 01:31:49,138
- And?
- We do not like that.

685
01:31:49,855 --> 01:31:51,811
Henrik is dying.

686
01:31:52,022 --> 01:31:56,182
My private life has nothing
to do with My task for Henrik.

687
01:31:56,397 --> 01:31:59,893
It affects everyone
in The Vanger Concern.

688
01:32:00,106 --> 01:32:05,012
Have you not done enough damage? Are you
going to drive Henrik to a heart attack

689
01:32:05,231 --> 01:32:08,015
by rooting up in my daughter's death?

690
01:32:09,522 --> 01:32:13,646
- Maybe you should pull out now.
- What do you mean?

691
01:32:13,856 --> 01:32:17,435
You only make things worse by
coming here with your whore.

692
01:32:17,647 --> 01:32:19,934
Not that tone mother.

693
01:32:20,147 --> 01:32:25,931
But perhaps you should take a
break. It has been quite exhausting.

694
01:32:27,106 --> 01:32:30,020
- There is a need for me.
- As your friend...

695
01:32:30,231 --> 01:32:36,230
Sorry, but I have a comment.
Henrik has signed a contract.

696
01:32:38,148 --> 01:32:42,141
As long as he lives,
it can not be repealed.

697
01:32:42,356 --> 01:32:47,974
Whether Mikael like it or
not, he is forced to continue.

698
01:33:01,773 --> 01:33:05,221
I'm sorry, that it would be so dramatic.

699
01:33:05,440 --> 01:33:09,813
- Why do you have Harriets chain on?
- What do you mean?

700
01:33:10,023 --> 01:33:13,887
Harriet had it on when she
disappeared. Now you have it.

701
01:33:14,106 --> 01:33:17,554
What are you saying? Accusing me?

702
01:33:18,773 --> 01:33:21,013
Where did you get it from?

703
01:33:21,231 --> 01:33:25,853
I inherited it after Anita. It
has never belonged to Harriet.

704
01:33:30,773 --> 01:33:33,060
Your sister Anita?

705
01:33:41,690 --> 01:33:45,020
Hello, Micke.

706
01:33:47,440 --> 01:33:49,478
All good?

707
01:34:01,065 --> 01:34:04,063
Anita is Harriet. It is not her.

708
01:34:04,274 --> 01:34:06,229
What are you talking about?

709
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:10,102
They fit me both. The
necklace is Anitas.

710
01:34:13,899 --> 01:34:18,888
Yes, this is Anitas.
Damn! they are similar.

711
01:34:19,107 --> 01:34:23,053
- What do we know about Anita?
- Harriets cousin and best friend.

712
01:34:23,274 --> 01:34:26,722
She had no alibi but was not suspected.

713
01:34:26,940 --> 01:34:30,769
After Harriet's death she
moved to London to study.

714
01:34:30,982 --> 01:34:34,846
She quick career, but died
of cancer 37 years old.

715
01:34:35,066 --> 01:34:37,519
She died 20 years ago.

716
01:34:38,399 --> 01:34:42,606
She did not tell Morell,
that it was her in the window.

717
01:34:42,816 --> 01:34:45,979
Perhaps to cover up the murderer.

718
01:34:55,357 --> 01:34:58,805
Hey plague. Want to
check an Anita Vanger?

719
01:35:03,982 --> 01:35:04,876
Plague?

720
01:35:05,077 --> 01:35:07,679
If there is anything, then he will find it.

721
01:36:44,734 --> 01:36:48,265
- What happened?
- An idiot shot me.

722
01:36:49,484 --> 01:36:52,932
- Did you see who shot?
- No. Damn!

723
01:36:57,359 --> 01:37:01,269
We must be really close now.
Someone does not like it.

724
01:37:01,484 --> 01:37:05,643
- We must call the police.
- What can they do?

725
01:37:05,859 --> 01:37:09,271
- Give me my mobile.
- Then I'll leave.

726
01:37:16,192 --> 01:37:19,771
We should not draw
any hasty conclusions.

727
01:37:19,984 --> 01:37:22,686
It can be a hunting accident.

728
01:37:22,901 --> 01:37:26,764
If it is not a hunting
accident then you are in danger.

729
01:37:27,776 --> 01:37:32,433
I think you should go
home. At least for a while.

730
01:37:32,651 --> 01:37:36,858
Ever since I came here,
everyone have asked me to leave.

731
01:37:38,817 --> 01:37:41,271
Is there anything new about BJ?

732
01:37:41,484 --> 01:37:47,102
We found no BJ in the system.
But we continue to look.

733
01:37:47,318 --> 01:37:53,148
There are two cameras out there,
and four here with motion sensors.

734
01:37:56,276 --> 01:37:58,267
Great.

735
01:38:07,818 --> 01:38:10,769
You do not want to go home?

736
01:38:13,693 --> 01:38:15,849
No.

737
01:38:25,401 --> 01:38:28,435
Do we have everything on video now?

738
01:38:30,151 --> 01:38:33,185
Yes. It is already online.

739
01:38:50,485 --> 01:38:52,641
- What are you doing?
- What?

740
01:38:52,860 --> 01:38:56,688
- Lie down in your bed.
- I want to be close to you.

741
01:38:59,860 --> 01:39:02,313
Okay, but I must sleep.

742
01:39:13,110 --> 01:39:17,151
What have you experienced?
How did you turn out this way?

743
01:39:21,735 --> 01:39:26,772
You know everything about me.
I do not know a shit about you.

744
01:39:28,569 --> 01:39:30,559
Not a thing.

745
01:39:32,360 --> 01:39:34,647
Yes, thats how it is.

746
01:40:12,111 --> 01:40:15,062
- Who is it?
- It's Morell.

747
01:40:18,069 --> 01:40:20,558
I found the last one.

748
01:40:20,777 --> 01:40:24,309
Rebecka Jacobsson with nicknamed Bea.

749
01:40:25,653 --> 01:40:28,604
BJ.

750
01:40:28,819 --> 01:40:31,734
That was why we did not find her.

751
01:40:31,944 --> 01:40:36,436
"When a man or woman have
a spirit in themselves..."

752
01:40:36,653 --> 01:40:40,018
"...they shall suffer
death. I will stone them."

753
01:40:42,944 --> 01:40:45,859
It is her.

754
01:40:46,069 --> 01:40:48,772
- Where was she murdered?
- In Karlstad.

755
01:40:48,986 --> 01:40:51,475
But it is more interesting

756
01:40:51,694 --> 01:40:56,850
she worked for Vanger until
his death in January 1965.

757
01:40:57,986 --> 01:41:01,020
She was secretary for Gottfried Vanger.

758
01:41:01,236 --> 01:41:05,182
Gottfried died before Harriet
disappeared. It was not him.

759
01:41:05,403 --> 01:41:09,646
But we must look at whether she was
in contact with others from the Vanger.

760
01:41:13,153 --> 01:41:17,810
Wait. Rebecka and Sara are Jewish names.

761
01:41:18,028 --> 01:41:20,730
- Magda...
- Magdalena.

762
01:41:22,070 --> 01:41:24,772
Mari, Maria. But liV?

763
01:41:28,778 --> 01:41:33,317
Eva means liv. I dare bet,
that Liv Ingvartsson was Jewish.

764
01:41:33,528 --> 01:41:38,186
Racist murder. This fits with
the pseudo-religious rituals.

765
01:41:39,820 --> 01:41:42,487
But what about Harriet?

766
01:41:42,695 --> 01:41:48,276
Harriet died, because she discovered
the connection. Why did we not see it?

767
01:41:48,487 --> 01:41:52,433
It is Jewish names. There was
three Nazis in the Vanger family.

768
01:41:52,653 --> 01:41:55,936
Only one was alive when Harriet died.

769
01:41:56,153 --> 01:41:58,191
Harald.

770
01:41:59,403 --> 01:42:03,184
Which coincidentally was out hunting,
when you run alone in the woods.

771
01:42:10,945 --> 01:42:14,276
The first murder took
place there in 1949.

772
01:42:14,487 --> 01:42:18,232
So Dalarna, Vilhelmina,
Uppsala, Karlstad.

773
01:42:18,445 --> 01:42:21,941
If Harald has been
there He left the track.

774
01:42:22,154 --> 01:42:26,278
- What do you think?
- The Vanger Concerns accounting.

775
01:42:26,487 --> 01:42:31,026
- Business Travel. There is
evidence. Restaurant and hotel bills.

776
01:42:31,237 --> 01:42:34,519
He has been deducted
for murder in taxes?

777
01:42:34,737 --> 01:42:38,980
Yes, I know the kind of financial men.

778
01:42:39,196 --> 01:42:43,936
Even if we can prove that he has
been everywhere, it is not enough.

779
01:42:47,487 --> 01:42:51,528
- Maybe he is hunting now.
- Are you proposing that we break in?

780
01:43:53,155 --> 01:43:56,485
We need to go a good bit back in time.

781
01:43:57,321 --> 01:44:00,568
There we have 89... 89...

782
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:03,446
We need from 1949 to 1966.

783
01:44:03,655 --> 01:44:06,902
Thank Henrik for his
business principles.

784
01:44:07,113 --> 01:44:10,277
Otherwise, the accounts
had been destroyed.

785
01:44:10,488 --> 01:44:13,854
But there they are now
it's just getting started.

786
01:44:16,822 --> 01:44:21,278
Miss Salander, what
did you really find out?

787
01:44:21,488 --> 01:44:24,273
Thank you, I do not need more help.

788
01:45:07,947 --> 01:45:10,614
IN THE FÜHRERS NAME I AWARD...

789
01:45:48,406 --> 01:45:51,985
What the hell are you
doing here? Answer me!

790
01:45:52,864 --> 01:45:54,689
Do not worry.

791
01:45:54,906 --> 01:45:59,942
Are you now to write about me
in your cursed Communist spray?

792
01:46:00,156 --> 01:46:02,526
I'm leaving now, Do not shoot.

793
01:46:02,739 --> 01:46:06,650
You're breaking into my home.
So I'm in good right to shoot.

794
01:46:06,864 --> 01:46:09,318
What the hell is going on here?

795
01:46:10,198 --> 01:46:13,149
- Stand still!
- Release the gun, Harald.

796
01:46:13,364 --> 01:46:16,565
- Release the gun now.
- Don't interfere!

797
01:46:18,990 --> 01:46:22,023
Release the gun. Release it.

798
01:46:34,365 --> 01:46:36,651
Are you okay?

799
01:46:36,865 --> 01:46:41,901
How the hell could Gottfried
get Such a sissy for a son?

800
01:46:54,865 --> 01:46:56,441
Harald...

801
01:47:01,865 --> 01:47:03,655
No.

802
01:47:11,907 --> 01:47:13,281
No.

803
01:47:19,865 --> 01:47:23,693
- We must get Morell.
- We can call from my place.

804
01:47:25,865 --> 01:47:29,527
Harald is not leaving. Come on.

805
01:47:50,782 --> 01:47:52,820
Gottfried?

806
01:48:03,199 --> 01:48:04,905
Gottfried.

807
01:48:19,741 --> 01:48:21,566
Uppsala 1964.

808
01:48:48,741 --> 01:48:51,692
Was there a group picture?

809
01:48:56,200 --> 01:48:58,025
What the hell?

810
01:49:00,616 --> 01:49:03,105
That can't be true.

811
01:49:09,783 --> 01:49:11,738
Blue sweater...

812
01:49:22,616 --> 01:49:24,406
What the hell?

813
01:49:26,158 --> 01:49:27,699
Shit.

814
01:49:45,867 --> 01:49:47,774
Does that help?

815
01:49:47,992 --> 01:49:51,902
- He scared me out of my wits.
- You do not joke with Harald.

816
01:49:53,033 --> 01:49:55,736
Why were you in his house?

817
01:49:57,158 --> 01:50:02,527
Harriet discovered a series of
ritual murders from 40s to 60s.

818
01:50:02,742 --> 01:50:06,949
We know that she discovered a
context the police knew about.

819
01:50:07,159 --> 01:50:10,489
We believe it was because
of that she was murdered.

820
01:50:11,534 --> 01:50:15,823
But that is... It sounds quite crazy.

821
01:50:16,617 --> 01:50:20,279
We have found the link
between the dead women.

822
01:50:20,492 --> 01:50:23,028
They all have Jewish names.

823
01:50:23,242 --> 01:50:28,444
Yes, Harald is not exactly
thrilled of Abraham genus.

824
01:50:28,659 --> 01:50:32,866
No. So I went in to see
if I could find anything.

825
01:50:34,409 --> 01:50:36,980
- And?
- Yeah, whatever?

826
01:50:38,909 --> 01:50:41,741
I did not find anything.

827
01:50:41,951 --> 01:50:46,276
But he did not exactly
behave, like if he is innocent.

828
01:50:48,034 --> 01:50:52,158
If Lisbeth can track his
doings through the accounts...

829
01:50:52,367 --> 01:50:55,863
we have evidence against
him. Receipts, invoices.

830
01:50:56,076 --> 01:50:58,280
She eis turning everything over.

831
01:51:11,243 --> 01:51:14,774
Ok. I'll call the police.

832
01:51:14,993 --> 01:51:17,067
Try Morell.

833
01:51:43,243 --> 01:51:45,814
What were you doing at Haralds place?

834
01:51:48,201 --> 01:51:49,742
Now now.

835
01:52:28,118 --> 01:52:32,159
Cry as much as you like,
Mikael. Cry as much you can.

836
01:52:32,368 --> 01:52:35,071
Do you think anyone can hear you?

837
01:53:02,327 --> 01:53:06,107
We both know how it will end for you.

838
01:53:15,786 --> 01:53:18,452
Why?

839
01:53:18,661 --> 01:53:21,149
Why what?

840
01:53:21,369 --> 01:53:24,781
- Everything is here.
- Why not?

841
01:53:24,994 --> 01:53:28,988
I live out all men's
dream, I take what I want.

842
01:53:31,994 --> 01:53:35,691
How many women after the first?

843
01:53:35,911 --> 01:53:39,193
That I do not know. I
have stopped counting.

844
01:53:39,411 --> 01:53:43,654
There sat a girl in the cage
there as we sat and ate upstairs.

845
01:53:45,369 --> 01:53:49,778
This kind of women disappear
all the time. No one miss them.

846
01:53:50,869 --> 01:53:53,358
Prostitutes, immigrants.

847
01:54:05,119 --> 01:54:10,026
What do you do with them? What
about the quotes? The mutilations?

848
01:54:13,911 --> 01:54:19,113
It was father's project. He mixed
race and religion into his hobby.

849
01:54:19,328 --> 01:54:24,318
But it was a mistake. You should
not let the bodies lie around.

850
01:54:28,578 --> 01:54:33,484
I take them on a trip out into the
boat, and then I throw them into the sea.

851
01:54:46,412 --> 01:54:48,070
Mikael?

852
01:55:21,745 --> 01:55:24,150
Mari was my first.

853
01:55:27,204 --> 01:55:28,613
64.

854
01:55:29,870 --> 01:55:31,695
You were 16 years old.

855
01:55:31,912 --> 01:55:37,493
It was my father, Gottfried, who
showed me how I had to strangle her.

856
01:55:46,787 --> 01:55:49,157
That is sick.

857
01:55:49,371 --> 01:55:51,941
It is about sex.

858
01:55:53,037 --> 01:55:58,074
The killing is just a natural
consequence of the rape.

859
01:55:58,287 --> 01:56:00,858
There must be no witnesses.

860
01:56:01,079 --> 01:56:05,736
Although I must admit I love
to see their disappointment.

861
01:56:08,621 --> 01:56:09,552
Disappointment?

862
01:56:09,653 --> 01:56:12,235
They refuse to understand that,
they must die.

863
01:56:13,871 --> 01:56:18,824
It is not included In their world view.

864
01:56:19,037 --> 01:56:22,368
They always think, I
will spare with them.

865
01:56:24,746 --> 01:56:27,365
It is a fantastic moment -

866
01:56:29,496 --> 01:56:33,075
when they realize they do not get away.

867
01:56:34,788 --> 01:56:36,743
When their eyes...

868
01:56:37,788 --> 01:56:40,454
...goes out... and die.

869
01:56:42,246 --> 01:56:44,948
You'll discover that yourself.

870
01:56:48,204 --> 01:56:52,068
And how does it feel, when
your sister's eyes died?

871
01:56:52,288 --> 01:56:55,488
- Harriet disappeared.
- I believe?

872
01:56:55,705 --> 01:56:57,944
Believe what the hell you want.

873
01:57:01,121 --> 01:57:05,530
I would have enjoyed to kill
her. But she disappeared.

874
01:57:05,746 --> 01:57:08,614
And you will also disappear.

875
01:57:14,413 --> 01:57:17,080
Want some water?

876
01:57:20,246 --> 01:57:21,905
Yes.

877
01:57:36,538 --> 01:57:38,280
Thank you.

878
01:57:39,413 --> 01:57:43,110
There you can see. You
are like all the others.

879
01:57:44,663 --> 01:57:50,245
A small, human gesture and you
get a glimmer of hope that...

880
01:57:50,455 --> 01:57:53,986
I may let you escape.

881
01:57:57,664 --> 01:57:59,453
Right?

882
01:58:32,206 --> 01:58:35,322
Do not worry. It's fast.

883
01:58:37,581 --> 01:58:40,911
I look forward to your little friend.

884
01:58:56,456 --> 01:58:59,205
Come and get it, dickhead.

885
01:59:15,331 --> 01:59:17,238
Are you okay?

886
01:59:59,956 --> 02:00:01,746
Fuck!

887
02:01:21,457 --> 02:01:23,863
I can not...

888
02:01:25,082 --> 02:01:27,749
I can not...

889
02:01:29,041 --> 02:01:31,576
I can not move...

890
02:01:33,749 --> 02:01:36,320
I can not move.

891
02:01:39,583 --> 02:01:41,372
Help me.

892
02:01:43,999 --> 02:01:46,832
Would you please help me?

893
02:03:44,750 --> 02:03:49,787
- Where is Martin?
- He will not return.

894
02:03:53,209 --> 02:03:55,330
What do you mean?

895
02:03:57,042 --> 02:03:59,875
He drove to his death.

896
02:04:04,292 --> 02:04:07,125
- He is done.
- Are you sure?

897
02:04:10,792 --> 02:04:13,495
What the hell have you done?

898
02:04:14,959 --> 02:04:18,823
He died in a car accident.
We know nothing. Okay?

899
02:04:27,543 --> 02:04:29,498
Blomkvist!

900
02:04:31,626 --> 02:04:34,992
- What the hell has happened here?
- Basement.

901
02:04:59,043 --> 02:05:01,413
What happened there?

902
02:05:06,418 --> 02:05:09,120
He died in an accident?

903
02:05:13,460 --> 02:05:15,664
For fuck sake, Lisbeth.

904
02:05:15,876 --> 02:05:20,119
His father trained him to
murder, when he was 16 years old.

905
02:05:21,001 --> 02:05:24,165
Anyone would get sick in the
head with that upbringing.

906
02:05:24,377 --> 02:05:28,287
Keep shut up with the victimization.
He nearly murdered you.

907
02:05:28,502 --> 02:05:31,369
He murdered and raped,
and he enjoyed it.

908
02:05:31,585 --> 02:05:35,910
He had the same chances as
us. You choose who you will be.

909
02:05:36,127 --> 02:05:41,033
He was no victim. He was a
damned pig who hated women.

910
02:05:45,585 --> 02:05:47,990
How did he die?

911
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:55,828
He burned to death.

912
02:05:59,919 --> 02:06:03,450
- Could you have saved him?
- Yes.

913
02:06:03,669 --> 02:06:06,667
- But you let him burn to death.
- Yes.

914
02:06:52,336 --> 02:06:55,536
I would never have done it Lisbeth.

915
02:06:56,961 --> 02:07:00,373
But I understand why you did it.

916
02:07:03,419 --> 02:07:06,417
I do not know what you have experienced.

917
02:07:09,419 --> 02:07:12,453
But I was about to
die down in the cellar,

918
02:07:13,836 --> 02:07:16,325
and you saved my life.

919
02:07:22,253 --> 02:07:24,955
Whatever you have seen

920
02:07:27,128 --> 02:07:30,079
you do not need to tell me.

921
02:07:33,045 --> 02:07:35,959
I'm just happy, you are here.

922
02:07:47,045 --> 02:07:48,502
Thank you.

923
02:08:05,753 --> 02:08:09,285
For the first time
in my life I feel old.

924
02:08:22,253 --> 02:08:27,124
- We are not finished yet.
- What do you mean?

925
02:08:27,337 --> 02:08:31,580
- Harriet was not a victim of Martin.
- What are you saying?

926
02:08:31,795 --> 02:08:34,627
Martin did not murder Harriet.

927
02:08:43,129 --> 02:08:44,835
Lisbeth?

928
02:08:47,795 --> 02:08:49,454
Lisbeth?

929
02:09:13,754 --> 02:09:17,997
There are two named Anita
Vanger. One dead in London.

930
02:09:18,212 --> 02:09:23,830
The other lives in Australia. First
entry into the country in 1966.

931
02:10:33,546 --> 02:10:35,253
Harriet?

932
02:10:38,588 --> 02:10:40,792
Harriet Vanger?

933
02:10:51,172 --> 02:10:53,162
Harriet Vanger?

934
02:10:55,172 --> 02:10:57,293
Is everything okay?

935
02:11:00,588 --> 02:11:02,875
Do we know each other?

936
02:11:06,505 --> 02:11:11,411
Yes, indeed. You and your cousin
looked after me when I was little.

937
02:11:14,130 --> 02:11:17,661
But I come on behalf of Henrik Vanger.

938
02:11:30,464 --> 02:11:32,999
Does he know I am alive?

939
02:11:37,422 --> 02:11:39,377
Not yet.

940
02:11:56,672 --> 02:11:59,374
I come to visit Agneta Salander.

941
02:11:59,589 --> 02:12:02,871
- Who, I should I say it is?
- Her daughter.

942
02:12:03,089 --> 02:12:06,537
Her daughter? Are you Agnetas daughter?

943
02:12:08,631 --> 02:12:12,376
Sorry, it's just... I
have not seen you before.

944
02:12:50,631 --> 02:12:52,586
Hello, mother.

945
02:12:55,798 --> 02:12:57,421
Mom?

946
02:12:59,798 --> 02:13:02,251
This is me. Lisbeth.

947
02:13:11,006 --> 02:13:12,962
Lisbeth...

948
02:13:21,298 --> 02:13:23,289
Are you Lisbeth?

949
02:13:25,257 --> 02:13:28,457
I would have com long ago.

950
02:13:36,673 --> 02:13:39,375
You've changed so much.

951
02:13:45,757 --> 02:13:49,336
- Do you have children?
- No.

952
02:13:53,007 --> 02:13:55,674
Have you a man?

953
02:13:59,840 --> 02:14:01,748
There is a...

954
02:14:07,549 --> 02:14:10,796
...but you must not fall in love.

955
02:14:11,007 --> 02:14:14,040
You know that better than anyone else.

956
02:14:19,007 --> 02:14:21,247
Right, Mom?

957
02:14:28,924 --> 02:14:32,870
I should have chosen
a better father to you.

958
02:14:33,757 --> 02:14:38,214
Mom! It was you who got hurt.

959
02:14:45,924 --> 02:14:47,796
Mom...

960
02:14:58,883 --> 02:15:00,672
Come in.

961
02:15:06,341 --> 02:15:09,458
Mikael. Welcome back.

962
02:15:11,799 --> 02:15:16,208
I have a good surprise. Promise
me, you do not get a heart attack.

963
02:15:16,424 --> 02:15:20,465
With all the pills
I eat at the moment...

964
02:15:20,674 --> 02:15:24,206
it is probably physically
impossible to have a heart attack.

965
02:15:52,008 --> 02:15:53,798
Harriet?

966
02:16:15,675 --> 02:16:17,749
Forgive me.

967
02:16:28,175 --> 02:16:30,415
Sorry.

968
02:16:33,175 --> 02:16:35,331
Sorry.

969
02:16:45,467 --> 02:16:49,082
I was 14, when dad raped
me for the first time.

970
02:16:50,592 --> 02:16:54,123
The year after he
took me to the cottage.

971
02:16:55,884 --> 02:16:58,207
Then came Martin.

972
02:17:01,050 --> 02:17:06,122
In the time after they
abused me several times.

973
02:17:10,051 --> 02:17:12,753
One day I had enough.

974
02:17:16,592 --> 02:17:19,128
Dad was drunk as usual.

975
02:17:27,384 --> 02:17:32,374
He was quoting bible quotes and boasting
of all the women he had murdered.

976
02:17:40,218 --> 02:17:43,169
I took the paddle and hit.

977
02:17:52,176 --> 02:17:56,086
I hold him, under the
water till he was still.

978
02:18:13,635 --> 02:18:17,545
I pushed the boat out so it
would look like an accident.

979
02:18:19,676 --> 02:18:22,378
But when I turned me around...

980
02:18:24,926 --> 02:18:27,249
...Martin was there.

981
02:18:29,801 --> 02:18:33,546
Martin treated me worse than Gottfried.

982
02:18:34,551 --> 02:18:38,213
You sent him to boarding
school in Uppsala,

983
02:18:38,427 --> 02:18:41,543
but at the Childrens day he came back.

984
02:18:43,510 --> 02:18:47,504
I was terrified that
it would start again.

985
02:18:55,552 --> 02:18:58,466
And then you went to Anita?

986
02:18:58,677 --> 02:19:02,753
Anita helped me out of here.

987
02:19:02,968 --> 02:19:07,377
When the bridge was opened
again, she drove me away.

988
02:19:07,593 --> 02:19:11,587
I lay on the back seat under a blanket.

989
02:19:16,385 --> 02:19:19,170
I've thought of you in all the years.

990
02:19:19,385 --> 02:19:24,422
The frames with the
pressed flowers I sent...

991
02:19:24,635 --> 02:19:28,843
to tell you I was somewhere out there.

992
02:19:31,802 --> 02:19:37,004
So I was sorry it when Mikael
told how you have interpreted them.

993
02:19:38,094 --> 02:19:43,331
If you had not sent them, you would
not be sitting here with me now.

994
02:19:53,344 --> 02:19:55,500
No.

995
02:20:11,302 --> 02:20:14,087
Lisbeth, it is me again.

996
02:20:15,219 --> 02:20:17,886
Call if you hear this.

997
02:20:20,511 --> 02:20:24,457
I hope you are doing well. Ring.

998
02:20:37,511 --> 02:20:41,007
You have visitors. Half an hour.

999
02:20:49,345 --> 02:20:52,177
I Am glad to see you.

1000
02:20:58,970 --> 02:21:00,925
Here.

1001
02:21:01,136 --> 02:21:04,134
- What is it?
- A little reading material.

1002
02:21:10,970 --> 02:21:15,426
- Please sit down?
- I just wanted to give you that.

1003
02:21:34,220 --> 02:21:37,420
I have only one and a half months left.

1004
02:22:07,845 --> 02:22:10,251
EVERYONE HAS SECRETS

1005
02:22:53,179 --> 02:22:59,046
Wennerströms empire is like
a living shapeless organism...

1006
02:23:01,429 --> 02:23:05,754
journalist Mikael Blomkvist,
who have served a sentence

1007
02:23:05,971 --> 02:23:11,007
for slander against Hans-Erik
Wennerström, accuse him again.

1008
02:23:11,221 --> 02:23:14,136
In a theme issue of Millennium.

1009
02:23:14,346 --> 02:23:20,345
He accuse Wennerström for
exerting serious economic crimes.

1010
02:23:21,179 --> 02:23:24,759
- Why do you accuse him?
- Yes, you wonder.

1011
02:23:24,971 --> 02:23:28,550
- What happens to Wennerström?
- There is a vacant cell.

1012
02:23:28,763 --> 02:23:33,799
According to Blomkvist the empire is
built on cartels in the third world.

1013
02:23:34,013 --> 02:23:39,796
Cartels who are involved in drug
trafficking and illicit arms trafficking.

1014
02:23:40,013 --> 02:23:42,134
There he comes!

1015
02:23:47,055 --> 02:23:50,420
the wanted financier Wennerström

1016
02:23:50,638 --> 02:23:54,928
was found dead this morning in
an apartment in Marbella, Spain.

1017
02:23:55,138 --> 02:23:59,345
cleaning aid found the
44-year-old financier.

1018
02:23:59,555 --> 02:24:04,924
The police believe it was suicide.
There is no suspicion of...

1019
02:24:05,138 --> 02:24:10,340
Internal affairs are now going through
all of Wennerströms bank accounts.

1020
02:24:10,555 --> 02:24:16,554
It turns out there is withdrawn money
on an account in the Cayman Islands.

1021
02:24:16,847 --> 02:24:21,469
We are talking about many millions.

1022
02:24:21,680 --> 02:24:25,460
police are looking for
a unidentified woman

1023
02:24:25,680 --> 02:24:29,544
which was caught on the
surveillance cameras.

1024
02:24:43,347 --> 02:24:45,254
Lisbeth...
