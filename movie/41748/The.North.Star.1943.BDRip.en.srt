1
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:39,702
Good morning,
my little honey bees.

2
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:41,728
Good morning!

3
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:43,835
Good morning. Good morning.

4
00:01:43,865 --> 00:01:45,367
Good morning, one and all.

5
00:01:45,408 --> 00:01:47,407
Good... Morning!

6
00:01:47,432 --> 00:01:48,934
Good morning!

7
00:02:07,545 --> 00:02:09,029
Anna!

8
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:10,766
Anna!

9
00:02:11,095 --> 00:02:12,095
Anna!

10
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:13,709
Where's Pavel Grigorich?

11
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:15,513
I've come to be your
guest for breakfast.

12
00:02:15,538 --> 00:02:16,538
Stop shouting.

13
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:18,255
Don't be so young
with the voice.

14
00:02:18,347 --> 00:02:20,052
You'll have to come
back, Comrade Karp.

15
00:02:20,172 --> 00:02:21,671
Grandpa is still asleep.

16
00:02:21,818 --> 00:02:24,152
A new baby came to the
hospital last night,

17
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:26,176
and then Grandpa came
home and did his writing.

18
00:02:26,201 --> 00:02:27,201
Good morning.

19
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:29,091
That's not the way you say it.

20
00:02:29,148 --> 00:02:32,150
You say, "a baby came
into the bright world

21
00:02:32,542 --> 00:02:35,411
in the darkest part
of the night."

22
00:02:37,829 --> 00:02:39,928
Don't talk so pretty.

23
00:02:39,953 --> 00:02:41,954
A new baby. Isn't that nice?

24
00:02:42,005 --> 00:02:43,506
What's nice about it?

25
00:02:43,554 --> 00:02:44,881
I -- I'll be back.

26
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:46,938
You argue too much.

27
00:02:47,095 --> 00:02:48,474
Heep!

28
00:02:49,145 --> 00:02:50,646
Good morning, Grandpa.

29
00:02:50,825 --> 00:02:52,888
Ah. Good morning, my lad.

30
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:06,559
You should not have
worked all night.

31
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:08,679
Mm. I had a good night's work.

32
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:10,750
Did a little writing.

33
00:03:10,775 --> 00:03:12,275
Feel better? Mm-hmm.

34
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,260
Come and have breakfast now.

35
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:15,655
Oh, dear.

36
00:03:21,224 --> 00:03:23,794
What seems to be the
trouble, Boris Stepanich?

37
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:26,971
It'll take a better mechanic
than I am to answer that.

38
00:03:27,136 --> 00:03:29,638
The patient is cured, Father.

39
00:03:29,663 --> 00:03:30,663
It's all right now.

40
00:03:30,688 --> 00:03:32,188
Hello, Comrade Karp.

41
00:03:32,213 --> 00:03:34,214
You ever been to Kiev?
Of course.

42
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,240
There was a pretty girl there
who lost her head over me.

43
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,718
Years ago. Oh, of course.

44
00:03:40,309 --> 00:03:42,745
Well, it is the
last day of school.

45
00:03:42,746 --> 00:03:44,669
Tomorrow morning,
we'll be on our way.

46
00:03:44,694 --> 00:03:47,696
It's our vacation, and we're
going to Kiev on a holiday.

47
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:49,184
That's a nice bus ride.

48
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:50,708
Not for us. We're hiking.

49
00:03:50,925 --> 00:03:52,927
All the way? Well, of course.

50
00:03:53,052 --> 00:03:54,553
It'll only take us
four or five days.

51
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:55,809
Only?

52
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:57,963
Marina is going?

53
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,763
Yes. Marina and
Clavdia and grisha.

54
00:04:00,911 --> 00:04:03,265
My brother -- unfortunately.

55
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:06,997
Ah, but Marina is
the one who counts.

56
00:04:08,318 --> 00:04:09,318
Have you proposed?

57
00:04:09,365 --> 00:04:12,238
Or does one propose in
these modern times?

58
00:04:12,275 --> 00:04:13,776
Good morning, Papa.

59
00:04:13,777 --> 00:04:15,279
Good morning.

60
00:04:22,543 --> 00:04:24,121
What are you doing, Marina?

61
00:04:24,146 --> 00:04:26,147
I'm baking honey
cakes for the trip.

62
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:27,529
The cakes have
to be baked now?

63
00:04:27,554 --> 00:04:30,056
You're not leaving
until tomorrow.

64
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:32,161
Well, it's hard at our age

65
00:04:32,186 --> 00:04:34,186
to remember how
exciting a trip can be.

66
00:04:34,593 --> 00:04:36,595
The planning is half the fun.

67
00:04:39,871 --> 00:04:42,374
A long time ago, this is
the way I wore my hair.

68
00:04:42,508 --> 00:04:45,011
Were you pretty, Mama,
when you were young?

69
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:47,073
I'm not so old, little one.

70
00:04:47,129 --> 00:04:49,632
Mama's pretty now.
And she's not old.

71
00:04:50,226 --> 00:04:51,727
It's only that
you're so young.

72
00:04:51,728 --> 00:04:53,729
I'm not so young.

73
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:55,388
There are plenty
who are younger.

74
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,131
Yes. And there always will be.

75
00:04:59,531 --> 00:05:02,691
Sophia, when you go marketing,
remind everybody to come

76
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:05,242
and help with the
loading of the trains.

77
00:05:05,332 --> 00:05:07,242
Tell them there will
be supper for all

78
00:05:07,243 --> 00:05:08,283
when the work is finished.

79
00:05:08,466 --> 00:05:10,467
I'll tell everybody!
I'll tell everybody!

80
00:05:10,714 --> 00:05:12,214
May I, Papa? May I?

81
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:14,048
I'll do it on my
way to school.

82
00:05:14,049 --> 00:05:15,723
Please, may I? May I, please?

83
00:05:15,748 --> 00:05:17,444
All right. You tell them.

84
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,491
I'll say there will be
supper for everybody.

85
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:20,524
Yes.

86
00:05:20,556 --> 00:05:23,059
I'll say there will
be music and singing.

87
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,559
I'll say there
will be dancing,

88
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,442
and I'll say there will
be cider for old people

89
00:05:26,467 --> 00:05:27,967
and fruit drinks for children.

90
00:05:28,163 --> 00:05:30,316
You might also remember to
say there will be work.

91
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:33,067
Oh.

92
00:05:33,068 --> 00:05:35,069
Yes. I'll say that, too.

93
00:05:35,538 --> 00:05:38,364
"Everybody must
work," I'll say.

94
00:05:40,402 --> 00:05:41,989
No pancakes?

95
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:45,024
You know what else the comrade
commander said to me?

96
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:47,467
You have my permission
not to tell me.

97
00:05:47,492 --> 00:05:49,493
"Eat pancakes."
That's what he said.

98
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:51,200
It has been
recently discovered

99
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:53,729
that pancakes are fine for
a bombardier's nerves.

100
00:05:54,284 --> 00:05:55,783
That ought to
interest you, Damian.

101
00:05:55,808 --> 00:05:57,310
You're going to be a doctor.

102
00:05:57,335 --> 00:05:59,333
It doesn't interest me.

103
00:06:00,624 --> 00:06:02,625
Don't worry with
those maps, Damian.

104
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:04,127
I know all the roads.

105
00:06:04,128 --> 00:06:05,403
And when we get to Kiev,

106
00:06:05,428 --> 00:06:08,930
I will show you and your little
friends all there is to see.

107
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:12,493
Me and my little friends
are still young.

108
00:06:12,494 --> 00:06:13,494
A visit to Kiev

109
00:06:13,495 --> 00:06:15,997
is something that doesn't
happen to us every day.

110
00:06:15,998 --> 00:06:18,231
And don't patronize
us about it.

111
00:06:18,256 --> 00:06:20,257
Be a man of the world in
front of your mirror.

112
00:06:20,408 --> 00:06:22,918
It's better that way.
Mirrors don't talk back.

113
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:24,005
Hmm!

114
00:06:24,224 --> 00:06:27,395
Most men in the world feel
pleased when they have sons.

115
00:06:27,441 --> 00:06:28,441
I wonder why.

116
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:30,487
I told you years ago.

117
00:06:30,512 --> 00:06:33,514
Two quiet little girls
would have been very nice.

118
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,371
Well, you can't change us now,
and you wouldn't if you could.

119
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:39,350
Two healthy, brilliant,
handsome sons.

120
00:06:39,404 --> 00:06:41,903
June 20, 1941, 8:00 A.M.,

121
00:06:41,928 --> 00:06:44,059
broadcasting from moscow.
Be still, both of you.

122
00:06:44,096 --> 00:06:49,100
German troop movements are
reported on the Polish border.

123
00:06:49,445 --> 00:06:51,092
Their nature is unknown.

124
00:06:51,147 --> 00:06:53,148
Reports reach us of
a typhus epidemic

125
00:06:53,173 --> 00:06:55,174
in the German-occupied
city of Warsaw.

126
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,202
London was bombed twice last
night by the Luftwaffe.

127
00:06:58,514 --> 00:07:00,016
In the Polish city of Lodz,

128
00:07:00,072 --> 00:07:03,573
112 Polish children died
this morning as a result

129
00:07:03,574 --> 00:07:07,078
of being made to give blood
transfusions to German wounded.

130
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:10,547
Children. Taking blood from...

131
00:07:10,581 --> 00:07:12,902
Here's a report from a
reliable source in --

132
00:07:32,274 --> 00:07:33,274
goodbye, now.

133
00:07:33,299 --> 00:07:34,205
Goodbye, sweetheart.

134
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,713
Goodbye, Papa.
Bye, baby.

135
00:07:36,167 --> 00:07:37,739
Goodbye, Papa.

136
00:07:37,810 --> 00:07:39,312
Bye, Mama. Bye, dear.

137
00:07:43,991 --> 00:07:46,287
Come on, Clavdia!
You'll be late!

138
00:07:46,437 --> 00:07:47,939
You're my brother,
not my guardian.

139
00:07:48,073 --> 00:07:49,575
Mind your business.

140
00:07:52,718 --> 00:07:54,162
Good morning, Clavdia.

141
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:56,188
Good morning, Marina.

142
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:57,221
You're early.

143
00:07:57,222 --> 00:07:59,224
Oh! You know I never
eat breakfast.

144
00:08:00,968 --> 00:08:02,969
You always look so clean.

145
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:04,889
You're no cleaner than I am.

146
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:07,916
Maybe not as clean.
And hair is curly.

147
00:08:07,941 --> 00:08:09,441
Your hair looks nice.

148
00:08:09,466 --> 00:08:11,468
Oh, it's as straight as wheat.

149
00:08:11,518 --> 00:08:13,520
And don't try to console me.

150
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,163
Well, well.

151
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,666
The last day of school
is a happy day.

152
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:21,667
Even I remember.

153
00:08:21,668 --> 00:08:23,319
Oh, no. No?

154
00:08:23,637 --> 00:08:25,639
We're very sorry
it's the last day.

155
00:09:07,639 --> 00:09:09,492
My first words will
be to congratulate

156
00:09:09,493 --> 00:09:11,995
our three pupils
in the last class

157
00:09:11,996 --> 00:09:13,997
who have all been
awarded scholarships

158
00:09:13,998 --> 00:09:16,501
to the state
University of Kiev.

159
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:20,699
One of those three has
taken the highest marks

160
00:09:21,005 --> 00:09:24,194
of any pupil in this
year's senior graduating class.

161
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:27,364
He is Damian Taratsa.

162
00:09:35,293 --> 00:09:39,427
It is not my custom to start
your vacation with a lecture.

163
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:44,919
But this is the summer
of 1941, a solemn time.

164
00:09:46,235 --> 00:09:48,738
No one of us knows
what will happen.

165
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:51,452
I don't have to remind you

166
00:09:51,453 --> 00:09:54,263
that we are people
with a noble history.

167
00:09:55,455 --> 00:09:57,880
You are expected to
carry on that history

168
00:09:57,911 --> 00:10:01,178
with complete devotion
and self-sacrifice.

169
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,342
I think you'll do that.

170
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:09,232
And now... Have a happy summer.

You know, Marina...

184
00:11:48,568 --> 00:11:51,570
I-I can't explain it, but,
well, I-I almost wish

185
00:11:51,571 --> 00:11:54,073
we weren't having
this supper tonight.

186
00:11:54,074 --> 00:11:56,075
Oh, goodness knows
I usually love it.

187
00:11:56,076 --> 00:11:57,578
But -- but it
interferes, really,

188
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,579
with the trip, if you
know what I mean.

189
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,582
Too many good things at once.

190
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,582
Mm. I felt it, too.

191
00:12:03,607 --> 00:12:05,027
I didn't want
anything to happen.

192
00:12:05,052 --> 00:12:06,554
Just the trip. Nothing else.

193
00:12:06,588 --> 00:12:08,587
Oh, well. We really won't
celebrate tonight.

194
00:12:08,588 --> 00:12:11,090
We'll just eat supper and act
like it was any other evening

195
00:12:11,091 --> 00:12:12,593
and we were home
with the family.

196
00:12:12,789 --> 00:12:15,790
You know what? I'm not
going to sing tonight.

197
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:18,018
Even if everyone asks
me, I won't sing.

198
00:12:18,332 --> 00:12:20,835
And don't you sing either.
Mnh-mnh.

I wish it was
tomorrow morning.

221
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:08,138
Kolya says we'll go to the
theater when we get to Kiev.

222
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:11,007
All we have to do is
apply for the tickets.

223
00:15:11,032 --> 00:15:12,531
We'll have three
whole days in Kiev.

224
00:15:12,539 --> 00:15:14,372
We shall see everything.

225
00:15:14,825 --> 00:15:16,542
It's been a good year.

226
00:15:16,543 --> 00:15:20,047
Scholarship to the university,
of course, means the most.

227
00:15:20,048 --> 00:15:22,427
There was a medal
for marksmanship.

228
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:24,454
And now this vacation.

229
00:15:26,647 --> 00:15:28,530
We'll be separated for a year.

230
00:15:28,555 --> 00:15:31,557
You'll be getting a scholarship
the following year.

231
00:15:31,558 --> 00:15:34,061
But it's this year
I'm thinking about.

232
00:15:34,062 --> 00:15:35,562
That's a long time.

233
00:15:37,063 --> 00:15:39,565
I don't think it
is at our age.

234
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:41,066
You don't think so?

235
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:43,069
How strange.

236
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:45,571
What are you saying, Marina?

237
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:49,076
Nothing. I don't want
to talk about it.

238
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:55,350
It's odd you don't think a year
away from me is a long time.

239
00:15:56,245 --> 00:15:58,040
It doesn't worry you?

240
00:15:58,745 --> 00:15:59,768
No.

241
00:16:00,134 --> 00:16:01,406
All right.

242
00:16:01,431 --> 00:16:04,434
You don't have to keep
saying it over and over.

243
00:16:06,255 --> 00:16:09,258
Are you sure you feel
about me as you used to?

244
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:12,215
I don't like this talk.
It -- it's bad.

245
00:16:12,274 --> 00:16:14,775
It's only natural that I --
it's not natural at all.

246
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:16,551
It's not like you.

247
00:16:17,664 --> 00:16:20,105
I've loved you since I was
old enough to see you.

248
00:16:20,716 --> 00:16:22,584
I will love you until I die.

249
00:16:22,609 --> 00:16:24,109
That's the way it is,

250
00:16:24,110 --> 00:16:25,612
and there's no need
to talk about it.

251
00:16:26,111 --> 00:16:27,821
You mean you'll never
talk about it?

252
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:29,346
You'll never tell me?

253
00:16:29,371 --> 00:16:31,526
I'll tell you in my own time.

254
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:33,940
But I'll not tell
you to waste time.

255
00:16:34,853 --> 00:16:35,854
Look here, Marina.

256
00:16:36,042 --> 00:16:38,544
You and I are -- are
like one person.

257
00:16:39,306 --> 00:16:42,138
And I always thought you wanted
both of us to be educated and --

258
00:16:42,163 --> 00:16:43,163
I didn't mean that.

259
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:45,218
Of course I want you to
go to the university.

260
00:16:45,243 --> 00:16:46,744
Of course.

261
00:16:46,769 --> 00:16:48,705
It'd make me sad
if you didn't --

262
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:49,730
and ashamed.

263
00:16:49,820 --> 00:16:51,322
But it wouldn't matter.

264
00:16:51,347 --> 00:16:52,846
I'd go anyway.

265
00:16:53,173 --> 00:16:55,747
I'm a citizen of this country.

266
00:16:55,773 --> 00:16:57,774
I intend to go forward
with it and --

267
00:16:57,829 --> 00:16:59,830
and to give it all I have.

268
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:02,021
I have strong
feelings about it.

269
00:17:02,141 --> 00:17:04,643
You'll come along
with those feelings.

270
00:17:05,210 --> 00:17:07,690
But... You don't
come before them.

271
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:11,048
I understand.

272
00:17:11,277 --> 00:17:15,166
I feel the same way for
myself, for both of us.

273
00:17:16,399 --> 00:17:17,900
I was being foolish.

274
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:19,902
I only wanted to be with you.

275
00:17:20,213 --> 00:17:22,698
I'm proud you got the
scholarship, of course.

276
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:23,723
You'll be a great man,

277
00:17:23,748 --> 00:17:26,151
and the whole district
will be proud of you.

278
00:17:26,176 --> 00:17:27,494
You'll have medals.

279
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,307
I think we'll go to the
theater every night.

280
00:17:29,332 --> 00:17:30,333
That's too often.

281
00:17:31,012 --> 00:17:32,513
And we'll grow old together,

282
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:35,243
and I'll be a beautiful
old woman and very kind.

283
00:17:35,385 --> 00:17:36,745
Oh, I'm sure of it.

284
00:17:36,926 --> 00:17:39,009
My grandchildren will love me,

285
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:41,551
and you will, too,
more than ever.

286
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,461
What's wrong with that?

287
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:44,961
Plenty of people
grow old together

288
00:17:44,962 --> 00:17:46,464
and have a fine
life behind them.

289
00:17:46,503 --> 00:17:49,006
I didn't say there was
anything wrong with it.

290
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,471
I shall buy baby
dresses in Kiev.

291
00:17:55,472 --> 00:17:56,973
For whom?

292
00:17:56,974 --> 00:17:58,976
For our first...

293
00:18:00,477 --> 00:18:01,978
Our grandchildren.

294
00:18:01,979 --> 00:18:03,260
Oh.

295
00:18:03,293 --> 00:18:06,985
You'll, um, you'll put the
dresses away for a while?

296
00:18:07,611 --> 00:18:10,114
Yes. Of course
that's what I mean.

297
00:19:26,352 --> 00:19:29,065
When we get home, you and
I should call a meeting,

298
00:19:29,066 --> 00:19:31,516
and the five of us should
go over all the plans

299
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:33,040
for our journey tomorrow.

300
00:19:33,065 --> 00:19:35,566
Don't you think, Kolya?

301
00:19:35,572 --> 00:19:37,073
I don't need to plan

302
00:19:37,074 --> 00:19:39,577
to get up and get dressed
and eat my breakfast.

303
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:41,077
I know how to do that.

304
00:19:41,078 --> 00:19:44,689
I'm getting tired of hearing you
children talk about this trip.

305
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:46,715
I'm only going because
Father made me.

306
00:19:47,374 --> 00:19:48,513
Oh.

307
00:19:48,538 --> 00:19:52,042
Oh, I thought it was because
-- well, because me.

308
00:19:52,581 --> 00:19:54,534
I-I mean us.

309
00:19:54,789 --> 00:19:56,367
Don't you like us?

310
00:19:57,594 --> 00:19:59,096
No.

311
00:19:59,596 --> 00:20:00,679
Oh.

312
00:20:01,209 --> 00:20:03,710
What's the matter
with you, Clavdia?

313
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:07,214
I-I have a choking
sensation in my chest.

314
00:20:07,215 --> 00:20:08,406
You eat too much.

315
00:20:08,431 --> 00:20:09,932
You usually do.

316
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:11,457
It's not at all that.

317
00:20:12,023 --> 00:20:14,526
It's my emotions in the chest.

318
00:20:16,224 --> 00:20:17,970
Clavdia, you're a throwback.

319
00:20:17,995 --> 00:20:19,497
What's that? What do you mean?

320
00:20:19,742 --> 00:20:22,245
Somebody who doesn't
belong to their own time.

321
00:20:22,402 --> 00:20:26,403
Ours is a new world, Clavdia.
You don't belong in it.

322
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:27,960
Oh, I see.

323
00:20:28,008 --> 00:20:30,009
You mean I'm rather
old-fashioned

324
00:20:30,034 --> 00:20:32,036
and romantic, rather.

325
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,617
Yeah.

326
00:21:42,172 --> 00:21:43,314
No.

327
00:21:43,953 --> 00:21:46,505
I've told you -- you
cannot come along.

328
00:21:48,246 --> 00:21:50,247
I'm always too young.

329
00:21:50,248 --> 00:21:52,750
I'm too young for everything.

330
00:21:53,144 --> 00:21:57,106
Well, someday, when everybody
else is too old for everything,

331
00:21:57,443 --> 00:21:59,445
you'll be just old enough.

332
00:22:29,448 --> 00:22:30,950
Take care of the puppy.

333
00:22:30,975 --> 00:22:32,974
I'll bring everybody
a present.

334
00:22:32,975 --> 00:22:34,476
Don't get your feet wet.

335
00:22:34,477 --> 00:22:36,478
And take care of yourselves.

336
00:22:36,539 --> 00:22:38,166
Goodbye.

337
00:22:39,166 --> 00:22:40,913
Goodbye!

338
00:22:42,922 --> 00:22:44,752
Goodbye.

339
00:22:59,144 --> 00:23:02,935
The first time we have ever
been separated, Grandpa.

340
00:23:03,842 --> 00:23:06,309
It's only for a short time.

341
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:15,198
Good morning.

342
00:23:15,877 --> 00:23:18,090
Clumsy in the body are
those clumsy in the head.

343
00:23:18,133 --> 00:23:19,412
You wake Grandpa and I'll --

344
00:23:19,437 --> 00:23:21,211
oh, I'm gonna kill you,
you nasty little thing.

345
00:23:21,236 --> 00:23:22,175
I'm gonna kill you.

346
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,202
Drink your milk, Clavdia.

347
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,903
You will now find it more
comfortable to get up.

348
00:23:37,306 --> 00:23:38,757
Goodbye, Father.

349
00:23:38,766 --> 00:23:41,118
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

350
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:44,032
Seven times last night
you said goodbye.

351
00:23:44,075 --> 00:23:45,076
We'll be back soon.

352
00:23:45,648 --> 00:23:48,149
We'll try to get
along without you.

353
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,152
Well, goodbye!

354
00:23:51,506 --> 00:23:53,494
Oh, Mother.

355
00:23:54,835 --> 00:23:56,327
We'll be back soon.

356
00:23:56,352 --> 00:23:57,660
Oh, have a good time, son.

357
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:58,746
We'll miss you.

358
00:23:59,147 --> 00:24:01,164
Damian?

359
00:24:02,902 --> 00:24:04,170
Damian!

360
00:24:05,806 --> 00:24:07,107
Coming!

361
00:24:11,947 --> 00:24:13,448
Good journey, Marina.

362
00:24:13,449 --> 00:24:14,246
Good journey.

363
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:20,504
Good journey! Good journey!

364
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:22,034
Good journey!

365
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:24,072
Good journey to us all!

366
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,454
Kolya!

367
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,904
Good morning, Kolya.

368
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:28,040
- Good morning!
- Hello.

369
00:24:28,065 --> 00:24:30,065
Good morning, good
morning, good morning.

370
00:24:30,981 --> 00:24:31,981
Hey!

371
00:24:32,441 --> 00:24:33,943
Good morning, Clavdia.

372
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:46,877
What's the matter with you?
With your face?

373
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:48,404
You look so foolish.

374
00:24:48,951 --> 00:24:50,953
Well, you never said "good
morning" to me before.

375
00:24:51,922 --> 00:24:52,954
Good morning!

376
00:24:52,986 --> 00:24:54,344
Good morning, Kolya.

377
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:55,750
Good morning!

378
00:24:57,764 --> 00:24:59,266
I don't like guns, Kolya.

379
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,291
Then don't have one.

380
00:25:00,316 --> 00:25:01,728
I don't like the
noise they make.

381
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:04,254
Who does? Why are
you carrying it?

382
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,232
If you look at me, Clavdia, you
will see that I'm in uniform.

383
00:25:07,257 --> 00:25:08,758
Men in uniform carry guns.

384
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,800
Uniforms, air force,

385
00:25:10,801 --> 00:25:12,754
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

386
00:25:13,130 --> 00:25:14,630
Remember now?

387
00:25:15,152 --> 00:25:17,282
Oh, you're teasing me.

388
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,308
Well, don't play with
that gun, please.

389
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,810
I intend to use it.

390
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,812
When we near the
end of the trip,

391
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,449
I intend to kill someone

392
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,815
and leave their carcass
for the hawks.

393
00:25:25,816 --> 00:25:26,817
You want to help?

394
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:29,038
Oh, no. No. I will stop you.

395
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:31,272
I-I will sacrifice myself.

396
00:25:31,297 --> 00:25:34,800
Oh, I couldn't stand to
think of you lying in jail,

397
00:25:34,825 --> 00:25:37,328
a murderer, tortured
with conscience.

398
00:25:37,329 --> 00:25:38,828
Oh, Kolya.

399
00:25:38,829 --> 00:25:40,830
I've got to kill him. But who?

400
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:42,256
Damian.

401
00:25:44,504 --> 00:25:48,419
Two weeks of you, child, is
going to be a long, long time.

Don't your feet hurt?

440
00:28:02,788 --> 00:28:05,385
In the army, your feet
learn to stop hurting.

441
00:28:05,386 --> 00:28:08,388
I told you young athletes not
to walk so far and so fast

442
00:28:08,389 --> 00:28:09,389
the first day.

443
00:28:10,758 --> 00:28:12,393
Make a fire.

444
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,163
We must have a fire.

445
00:28:16,445 --> 00:28:19,085
A fire is so romantic.

446
00:28:21,378 --> 00:28:24,331
Oh, we must have a fire.

447
00:28:24,906 --> 00:28:28,408
Otherwise, we can't
sit around and dream.

448
00:28:28,409 --> 00:28:30,912
Maybe it would be
better to kill you.

449
00:29:59,381 --> 00:30:03,498
Do, um, do all men make
noises when they sleep?

450
00:30:03,523 --> 00:30:05,525
I don't know. I never
listen to all men.

451
00:30:12,513 --> 00:30:13,513
Hey, it's Karp.

452
00:30:13,514 --> 00:30:15,515
Oh! Karp!

453
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:18,018
Good morning, Karp!
Good morning!

454
00:30:18,019 --> 00:30:20,522
Good morning. Good morning.
I thought we'd pass you.

455
00:30:20,523 --> 00:30:22,022
We're on our way home.

456
00:30:22,023 --> 00:30:23,525
I'll give you a ride
to the crossroads.

457
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:25,525
Good! It's time for a ride.

458
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:28,113
You can't go on a walking trip
and take a ride. You can't.

459
00:30:28,177 --> 00:30:30,464
Well, you see
more if you walk,

460
00:30:30,489 --> 00:30:32,402
but we'd only be
riding a few miles.

461
00:30:32,427 --> 00:30:33,533
Oh, come on.

462
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:36,037
And riding's good
for the feet.

463
00:30:52,907 --> 00:30:56,056
Well, well. Nothing
like having good feet.

464
00:30:56,057 --> 00:30:57,557
My feet are not good.

465
00:30:57,582 --> 00:30:59,583
They're much too small.
Everybody knows that.

466
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:01,513
I think we should walk.

467
00:31:01,538 --> 00:31:03,539
You can't go on a walking
trip and take a ride.

468
00:31:03,564 --> 00:31:05,065
Who made up that law?

469
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:06,568
It's not a law. It's just --

470
00:31:06,569 --> 00:31:09,069
well, it's --
it's not romantic.

471
00:31:09,070 --> 00:31:10,070
I see.

472
00:31:10,071 --> 00:31:13,073
You and Marina walk.
We men will ride.

473
00:31:13,247 --> 00:31:14,749
Would you ride while I walked?

474
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:17,577
Darling Marina, I'm
not making you walk.

475
00:31:17,782 --> 00:31:19,783
But would you let me
walk while you rode?

476
00:31:19,808 --> 00:31:21,581
The brightest of women
are not bright.

477
00:31:21,582 --> 00:31:23,083
I'm learning that.

478
00:31:23,084 --> 00:31:24,084
We are women.

479
00:31:24,085 --> 00:31:26,086
Different things go
on in our heads.

480
00:31:26,087 --> 00:31:27,589
That's what makes
us attractive.

481
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,455
You coming?

482
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,831
If you're quite
certain you want me.

483
00:31:36,527 --> 00:31:38,528
A fine marriage yours will be.

484
00:31:38,557 --> 00:31:39,926
Boss you and then
laugh at you.

485
00:31:39,962 --> 00:31:41,462
Oh, come on, Clavdia.

486
00:31:41,602 --> 00:31:43,603
When you don't stand
by your convictions,

487
00:31:43,604 --> 00:31:46,106
you set back the cause of all
women everywhere in the world.

488
00:31:46,107 --> 00:31:48,108
She's an interesting
type, Clavdia.

489
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:50,111
Like a piece in a museum.

490
00:32:08,638 --> 00:32:11,641

499
00:32:47,355 --> 00:32:50,170
Your pig doesn't smell so
nice now that the sun is up.

500
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:51,671
And who does?

501
00:32:51,953 --> 00:32:54,955

504
00:33:04,096 --> 00:33:05,661
What's the matter?

505
00:33:05,686 --> 00:33:07,187
What?

506
00:33:07,188 --> 00:33:09,689
Something the matter
with the sun.

507
00:33:09,690 --> 00:33:12,193
Is that an old saying, Karp?

508
00:33:13,694 --> 00:33:16,196
What's wrong with the sun?
Tell me what you mean.

509
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:17,697
I don't know.

510
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:19,199
But you feel it, too.

511
00:33:19,283 --> 00:33:20,700

513
00:33:24,165 --> 00:33:26,514
Stop that singing, please!

514
00:33:26,539 --> 00:33:29,541
What's the matter with you?
Why shouldn't we sing?

515
00:33:29,542 --> 00:33:31,044
Because I've been
hearing something!

516
00:33:31,045 --> 00:33:33,044
You've been hearing
your own head.

517
00:33:33,045 --> 00:33:34,546
A wit.

518
00:33:34,547 --> 00:33:35,548
I hear it.

519
00:33:35,699 --> 00:33:37,700
I've been hearing
it for an hour.

520
00:33:37,779 --> 00:33:39,780
But I don't know.

521
00:33:39,836 --> 00:33:43,339
Sometimes I hear things
from other years.

522
00:33:43,340 --> 00:33:46,842
Sometimes I even forget
what year it is.

523
00:33:46,843 --> 00:33:49,845
1914, 1915 --

524
00:33:49,846 --> 00:33:51,882
or 1941.

525
00:33:55,201 --> 00:33:57,202
What are you
carrying on about?

526
00:33:57,227 --> 00:33:59,198
We can all hear it.
They're planes.

527
00:33:59,384 --> 00:34:01,385
And you ought to know
what planes sound like.

528
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:03,923
They're many planes, and
they're not far from here.

529
00:34:03,948 --> 00:34:05,947
Can't we have an air force
while you're on leave?

530
00:34:06,139 --> 00:34:08,381
You should have let Grandpa
examine your head.

531
00:34:08,419 --> 00:34:10,922
Maybe there's something
wrong inside.

532
00:34:14,457 --> 00:34:15,959
Whoa!

533
00:34:16,459 --> 00:34:18,461
Whoa.

534
00:35:00,456 --> 00:35:03,459
Get down! All of you!
Get down immediately!

535
00:35:05,007 --> 00:35:07,510
We're being bombed!
Understand that! Quickly!

536
00:35:10,222 --> 00:35:14,392
Get out of your wagons and get
into the ditch immediately!

537
00:35:17,965 --> 00:35:20,021
Leave the horses.
Get in the ditch!

538
00:35:20,022 --> 00:35:21,523
I don't believe you. We
can't leave the horses.

539
00:35:21,524 --> 00:35:24,215
I intend to use this gun on
anybody who isn't in that ditch.

540
00:36:37,099 --> 00:36:38,601
Marina.

541
00:37:26,216 --> 00:37:27,216
Will he --

542
00:37:27,217 --> 00:37:28,718
I don't know yet. I
don't think he --

543
00:37:28,719 --> 00:37:30,442
let me. No.

544
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,973
You take a drink
of water, child.

545
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,775
Both of you... Close your
eyes and take my arm.

546
00:37:50,467 --> 00:37:54,290
The face of war is ugly
and not for the young.

547
00:37:54,865 --> 00:37:57,603
We are not young anymore.

548
00:38:34,915 --> 00:38:36,704
Any better?

549
00:38:36,977 --> 00:38:38,479
No.

550
00:38:41,121 --> 00:38:42,647
Clavdia?

551
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:43,854
No.

552
00:38:45,121 --> 00:38:48,641
I guess it's the first time in
my life I haven't been hungry.

553
00:38:48,884 --> 00:38:52,388
Oh, yesterday we were home,
and everybody in the --

554
00:38:53,412 --> 00:38:57,497
one day you're home,
and the next day...

555
00:38:58,224 --> 00:39:00,810
The next day, here you are.

556
00:39:01,467 --> 00:39:04,814
Last week, the little boy was
in the store with his mother.

557
00:39:04,815 --> 00:39:06,816
I met them there.

558
00:39:06,817 --> 00:39:08,317
He had a ball,

559
00:39:08,592 --> 00:39:11,321
and he was bouncing it
with his left hand.

560
00:39:11,985 --> 00:39:15,185
I remember because I
noticed he was left-handed

561
00:39:15,301 --> 00:39:17,803
and wondered what it felt
like to be left-handed.

562
00:39:17,945 --> 00:39:20,947
And now there he is
without his left hand.

563
00:39:21,272 --> 00:39:23,274
Without the hand that
bounced the ball!

564
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:25,835
Oh! I shouldn't be
talking this way!

565
00:39:25,836 --> 00:39:27,336
I know it!

566
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:29,338
You're all ashamed of me.

567
00:39:29,459 --> 00:39:31,841
You are what you are, Clavdia.

568
00:39:31,842 --> 00:39:34,345
It is my opinion that the
trouble in the world

569
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:36,345
comes from people who
don't know what they are,

570
00:39:36,346 --> 00:39:38,849
who pretend to be
something they're not.

571
00:39:40,851 --> 00:39:42,351
Come on, Clavdia.

572
00:39:42,352 --> 00:39:43,623
I'll wash your face.

573
00:39:43,899 --> 00:39:45,901
Dirty cheeks.

574
00:39:48,645 --> 00:39:49,716
Go back.

575
00:39:49,717 --> 00:39:53,221
It's over. There
is nothing to do.

576
00:40:18,613 --> 00:40:20,247
Good morning, Nadya.

577
00:40:20,248 --> 00:40:22,113
Well, how do you feel?

578
00:40:22,179 --> 00:40:25,181
I always wanted to know
how the doctor felt.

579
00:40:25,253 --> 00:40:27,384
I'm very glad to have a patient.

580
00:40:27,409 --> 00:40:29,410
People around here
are too healthy.

581
00:40:29,623 --> 00:40:30,623
You like your baby?

582
00:40:30,758 --> 00:40:33,761
Oh, she's very ugly,
like her father.

583
00:40:35,239 --> 00:40:36,741
And beautiful.

584
00:41:10,298 --> 00:41:13,301
Olga!

585
00:41:50,646 --> 00:41:52,648
Commander Petrov of the
12th Border Cavalry

586
00:41:52,706 --> 00:41:54,707
speaking to the
border villages.

587
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:56,418
The fascist armies
of the German Reich

588
00:41:56,419 --> 00:41:58,418
invaded the Soviet
Union this morning.

589
00:41:58,419 --> 00:41:59,920
I will repeat.

590
00:41:59,921 --> 00:42:01,423
German armies crossed the border

591
00:42:01,424 --> 00:42:03,403
of the Soviet Union
this morning.

592
00:42:03,489 --> 00:42:06,363
The attack was made with
unprecedented fury.

593
00:42:06,427 --> 00:42:07,928
But our land will be defended

594
00:42:07,929 --> 00:42:10,653
with a fury the fascist
armies have never known.

595
00:42:11,025 --> 00:42:14,529
To the border villages,
salute, comrades.

596
00:42:14,666 --> 00:42:16,168
The war has come.

597
00:43:51,869 --> 00:43:56,260
Comrades, we have good reason to
know that our country is at war.

598
00:43:57,203 --> 00:44:00,814
In our small village alone,
30 people have been injured.

599
00:44:01,231 --> 00:44:03,885
Eleven people have been killed.

600
00:44:04,037 --> 00:44:06,721
But this is not a
time for mourning.

601
00:44:07,097 --> 00:44:10,049
It is time for revenge.

602
00:44:10,624 --> 00:44:12,744
We will divide into two groups,

603
00:44:12,831 --> 00:44:15,833
each to do his duty from
this day until death.

604
00:44:17,025 --> 00:44:18,995
The able-bodied men
are to come forward

605
00:44:19,020 --> 00:44:20,427
to the right of this building.

606
00:44:20,939 --> 00:44:23,205
We will move from the
village to the hills

607
00:44:23,230 --> 00:44:25,231
and take our position
as guerrillas.

608
00:44:25,791 --> 00:44:27,268
I will go immediately

609
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:30,652
to Comrade Commander
Petrov's Garrison to get the guns.

610
00:44:32,962 --> 00:44:36,610
The second group has
the hardest job.

611
00:44:37,431 --> 00:44:39,836
They must stay behind.

612
00:44:41,125 --> 00:44:43,628
As guerrillas, we must
have aid and information.

613
00:44:44,701 --> 00:44:49,206
As villagers, you must, before
the entrance of the Germans,

614
00:44:49,866 --> 00:44:51,867
destroy everything.

615
00:44:51,925 --> 00:44:53,425
Everything, comrades.

616
00:44:53,961 --> 00:44:55,969
The houses you have built,

617
00:44:56,016 --> 00:44:58,017
the crops you have
sowed with your hands,

618
00:44:58,018 --> 00:45:00,539
the cattle you have raised.

619
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:04,313
The Germans are not more
than 50 miles away.

620
00:45:05,525 --> 00:45:08,243
Yours is the dangerous job.

621
00:45:09,169 --> 00:45:11,734
For this job, you
will volunteer.

622
00:45:13,033 --> 00:45:16,414
It is you who may have
to live with the...

623
00:45:18,429 --> 00:45:20,932
...the Germans.

624
00:45:37,404 --> 00:45:40,095
"I, who am about to become
a guerrilla fighter

625
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:43,122
of the Soviet Union, I
take this solemn oath."

626
00:45:43,403 --> 00:45:46,405
I, who am about to become
a guerrilla fighter

627
00:45:46,430 --> 00:45:50,433
of the Soviet Union, I
take this solemn oath.

628
00:45:50,434 --> 00:45:52,935
"I will not lay down these arms

629
00:45:52,936 --> 00:45:55,439
until the last fascist is
driven from our land."

630
00:45:55,939 --> 00:45:58,442
I will not lay down these arms

631
00:45:58,555 --> 00:46:01,557
until the last fascist
is driven from our land.

632
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:05,842
"I am willing to give my
life, to die in battle

633
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:08,439
to keep my people from
fascist slavery."

634
00:46:08,787 --> 00:46:13,291
I am willing to give my
life, to die in battle

635
00:46:13,318 --> 00:46:16,482
to keep my people
from fascist slavery.

636
00:46:43,578 --> 00:46:45,579
You know where we'll be.

637
00:46:45,663 --> 00:46:48,873
One of us will come every
night to the pine grove.

638
00:46:49,802 --> 00:46:52,804
Remember, we'll need
supplies and information.

639
00:46:53,378 --> 00:46:55,929
This is our land, our village!

640
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:59,570
We remember we fought another
war to make them ours.

641
00:46:59,675 --> 00:47:02,175
We swear to give our
lives if they be needed.

642
00:47:02,314 --> 00:47:04,817
We swear!

659
00:48:34,775 --> 00:48:35,890
I'm ready, Comrade Petrov.

660
00:48:35,891 --> 00:48:37,392
Good. Now, just a moment.

661
00:48:37,393 --> 00:48:39,394
These reports show the
Germans rapidly advancing

662
00:48:39,395 --> 00:48:40,395
across our territory.

663
00:48:40,396 --> 00:48:42,397
By nightfall, there
won't be a highway

664
00:48:42,398 --> 00:48:43,900
free of their guns,
their tanks,

665
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:46,401
and their supply trucks,
all going to the front.

666
00:48:46,402 --> 00:48:48,162
Remember, you have a
good 40 miles to travel.

667
00:48:48,341 --> 00:48:50,130
Your best chance is to
take to the back road.

668
00:48:50,155 --> 00:48:51,155
That'll take too long.

669
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:52,787
I'll have to take a
chance on the highway.

670
00:48:52,812 --> 00:48:54,547
We need that ammunition
bad and quick.

671
00:48:54,586 --> 00:48:56,358
I'll get the truck through.
You can count on it.

672
00:48:56,383 --> 00:48:57,445
Good.

673
00:49:10,201 --> 00:49:12,305
Comrade Karp is going
to take my place.

674
00:49:12,330 --> 00:49:14,833
My duty is to report to
the nearest airfield.

675
00:49:14,982 --> 00:49:17,432
So gather around,
listen closely,

676
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:19,482
and I'll show you what I
think is your only chance

677
00:49:19,507 --> 00:49:21,006
to get back to the village.

678
00:49:21,366 --> 00:49:23,869
The Germans must have crossed
the river at the upper bend,

679
00:49:23,894 --> 00:49:25,045
and --

680
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:30,364
get down, everybody!

681
00:50:33,351 --> 00:50:34,853
Father!

682
00:50:36,175 --> 00:50:38,177
Kolya.

683
00:50:40,875 --> 00:50:42,445
Damian.

684
00:50:43,018 --> 00:50:45,520
Get the guns out.

685
00:50:45,822 --> 00:50:47,824
Save the guns.

686
00:50:48,324 --> 00:50:50,326
Get them out.

687
00:51:00,035 --> 00:51:02,037
Get these boxes out!

688
00:51:08,589 --> 00:51:10,044
Did you do it?

689
00:51:10,045 --> 00:51:11,425
Yes, Father.

690
00:51:11,547 --> 00:51:13,049
They're safe.

691
00:51:14,443 --> 00:51:16,386
For our men.

692
00:51:17,459 --> 00:51:19,962
Take it to them.

693
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:25,281
They're... They're at
the end of the stream.

694
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:27,483
Other side,

695
00:51:27,563 --> 00:51:30,064
Obmyk Hill...

696
00:51:30,065 --> 00:51:34,570
Beyond the pinewoods, past...

697
00:51:36,118 --> 00:51:38,621
Take it back to them.

698
00:51:38,952 --> 00:51:39,952
You hear me?

699
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:42,479
Yes, Father. We'll
take it back.

700
00:51:42,504 --> 00:51:47,581
Say hello to... To
your mother for me.

701
00:52:15,611 --> 00:52:17,657
I promise.

702
00:52:48,517 --> 00:52:50,582
Well, that's all of it.

703
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:52,893
I'll say goodbye now.

704
00:52:53,374 --> 00:52:55,375
Travel at night and
stick to the woods.

705
00:52:55,835 --> 00:52:57,275
When you get to the
upper crossroads,

706
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,791
you'll see a little --
but what about you?

707
00:52:58,816 --> 00:53:00,432
You said the Germans
had crossed the river.

708
00:53:00,457 --> 00:53:02,458
How can you get
to the airfield?

709
00:53:03,127 --> 00:53:05,112
I'll get through all right.

710
00:53:05,661 --> 00:53:07,700
Now, do your best.

711
00:53:08,037 --> 00:53:09,924
Don't be frightened.

712
00:53:09,981 --> 00:53:13,536
Fear is a bad enemy -- or
so people have told me.

713
00:53:14,646 --> 00:53:16,146
Bye, Clavdia.

714
00:53:16,171 --> 00:53:18,173
Goodbye, Kolya.

715
00:53:19,675 --> 00:53:21,177
Marina.

716
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:27,682
We'll do the best we can.
That's all.

717
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:29,973
Tell Mother that...

718
00:53:38,694 --> 00:53:39,694
Grisha.

719
00:53:39,695 --> 00:53:41,697
Goodbye, Kolya.

720
00:53:43,871 --> 00:53:45,873
Look after them, Karp.

721
00:54:09,399 --> 00:54:12,903
Twenty-five years ago, we
fought and died for this earth.

722
00:54:15,372 --> 00:54:16,873
People go forward.

723
00:54:16,874 --> 00:54:18,376
They fight for themselves

724
00:54:18,377 --> 00:54:20,376
and make things better
for themselves --

725
00:54:20,377 --> 00:54:24,860
more food, a good bed, jokes
to make and time to laugh.

726
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:28,259
Then the filthy come
and try to stop it.

727
00:54:28,524 --> 00:54:30,025
They want to take
away from people

728
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,553
all the good they've made
for themselves.

729
00:54:34,555 --> 00:54:38,058
Well... Then you take your gun

730
00:54:38,328 --> 00:54:41,832
and you fight until
you've killed all such.

731
00:54:44,401 --> 00:54:45,902
Ready, comrades?

732
00:54:45,903 --> 00:54:47,403
Yes, comrade.

733
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:48,906
We're ready.

734
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:11,102
We are ordered to occupy
the North Star village.

735
00:55:11,127 --> 00:55:13,128
How big is this village?

736
00:55:13,190 --> 00:55:14,692
Not big.

737
00:55:15,068 --> 00:55:17,571
We're only taking
125 men to hold it.

738
00:55:17,904 --> 00:55:21,097
We are ordered to establish
a regimental field hospital

739
00:55:21,098 --> 00:55:23,381
in the village
North Star ahead.

740
00:55:23,841 --> 00:55:26,578
Field hospital and a
village dispensary.

741
00:55:26,603 --> 00:55:29,105
How can I take care of all
these men and more to come?

742
00:55:29,106 --> 00:55:30,608
The order says that
more ambulances

743
00:55:30,609 --> 00:55:32,108
and doctors will
be sent to us.

744
00:55:32,109 --> 00:55:33,609
I don't want doctors.

745
00:55:33,610 --> 00:55:35,111
I need surgeons.

746
00:55:35,564 --> 00:55:39,068
The colonel has forgotten me.
I am a surgeon.

747
00:55:39,740 --> 00:55:43,837
A surgeon is a man who can
operate, Dr. Richter.

748
00:55:44,520 --> 00:55:46,522
I have not forgotten you.

749
00:55:54,372 --> 00:55:58,099
Dr. Richter, where did you
take your medical training?

750
00:55:58,135 --> 00:56:01,138
Freiburg, as I have told the
colonel many times before.

751
00:56:03,098 --> 00:56:05,100
That was a good school.

752
00:56:05,142 --> 00:56:06,752
I must beg the
colonel's pardon.

753
00:56:06,787 --> 00:56:08,602
With respect to the colonel's superior
rank and reputation,

754
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:10,146
I must beg the
colonel's pardon to --

755
00:56:10,147 --> 00:56:13,149
do not beg my pardon
so often, Dr. Richter.

756
00:56:13,529 --> 00:56:16,152
Good manners do not
make a good surgeon.

757
00:56:16,396 --> 00:56:17,898
It's well known, of course,

758
00:56:18,006 --> 00:56:20,841
the colonel studied at the
University of Leipzig.

759
00:56:20,876 --> 00:56:22,877
In the great days.

760
00:56:22,990 --> 00:56:25,905
I was a pupil of freidenthal.

761
00:56:26,343 --> 00:56:27,843
His most famous pupil.

762
00:56:27,907 --> 00:56:30,334
Freidenthal? The Jew?

763
00:56:30,410 --> 00:56:32,818
Yes. Freidenthal the Jew.

764
00:56:32,843 --> 00:56:34,844
The colonel did not
mind his being a Jew?

765
00:56:34,869 --> 00:56:36,370
Mind?

766
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:39,396
I never thought about
it in those days.

767
00:56:39,926 --> 00:56:41,928
It must be pleasant to
be so sure of oneself.

768
00:56:42,717 --> 00:56:44,219
I should like to
think I was as good

769
00:56:44,271 --> 00:56:45,773
as the colonel thinks he is.

770
00:56:47,427 --> 00:56:50,429
The day you think you're as
good as I am, Dr. Richter,

771
00:56:50,508 --> 00:56:52,431
I will know that
you're suffering

772
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:53,824
from delusions of grandeur

773
00:56:53,825 --> 00:56:56,054
and I shall commit
you to an asylum.

774
00:56:56,202 --> 00:56:58,705
Trust me, Dr. Richter.

775
00:57:01,941 --> 00:57:09,941
Burn your houses! The
Germans are coming!

776
00:57:15,955 --> 00:57:18,958
Burn your houses! The
Germans are coming!

777
00:57:24,377 --> 00:57:26,378
It's hard. The hardest part.

778
00:57:26,403 --> 00:57:28,404
The hardest part.

779
00:57:28,429 --> 00:57:29,931
Go and do it now.

780
00:57:29,956 --> 00:57:33,460
Others give their lives. We
give what is life to us.

781
00:59:10,069 --> 00:59:11,342
Look.

782
00:59:11,571 --> 00:59:13,073
Another burning village.

783
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:16,334
Speed up. Speed up.

784
00:59:23,583 --> 00:59:26,086
Quite different, isn't
it, Dr. Richter?

785
00:59:26,498 --> 00:59:29,500
The Army of the Third Reich
didn't see burning villages

786
00:59:29,525 --> 00:59:31,526
on its pleasant tour
through Western Europe.

787
00:59:31,551 --> 00:59:32,856
This amuses the colonel?

788
00:59:32,881 --> 00:59:35,381
No. Danger doesn't amuse me.

789
00:59:35,474 --> 00:59:37,661
I only state facts.

790
00:59:38,626 --> 00:59:41,628
A strong people. One
has always heard that.

791
00:59:42,085 --> 00:59:44,208
A hard people to conquer.

792
01:01:20,910 --> 01:01:22,855
Silence!

793
01:01:25,863 --> 01:01:28,112
Who is responsible for the
burning and destruction

794
01:01:28,137 --> 01:01:29,138
in this village?

795
01:01:37,566 --> 01:01:40,069
Where are the younger men?

796
01:01:43,793 --> 01:01:46,697
They burned it and
have tried to escape.

797
01:01:47,407 --> 01:01:48,909
Is that correct?

798
01:02:02,990 --> 01:02:04,852
Has the hospital
been burned down?

799
01:02:04,877 --> 01:02:07,378
It is not bad. We caught it.

800
01:02:07,847 --> 01:02:09,349
Carry in the
casualties immediately

801
01:02:09,381 --> 01:02:10,882
and get the operative
cases ready.

802
01:02:10,907 --> 01:02:12,409
As you order, colonel.

803
01:02:20,644 --> 01:02:23,146
The chairman of the Soviet
of this collective farm

804
01:02:23,295 --> 01:02:26,298
is called... Rodion Pavlov.

805
01:02:27,354 --> 01:02:29,356
Is he here?

806
01:02:31,655 --> 01:02:33,657
Where is his family?

807
01:02:37,436 --> 01:02:39,311
I wish these
questions answered!

808
01:02:39,498 --> 01:02:41,666
You have already, by the
burning of this village,

809
01:02:41,667 --> 01:02:44,583
shown yourselves to be
enemies of the German army.

810
01:02:46,047 --> 01:02:49,490
We punish our enemies...
Severely.

811
01:02:51,776 --> 01:02:54,279
Where is the wife
of Rodion Pavlov?

812
01:03:00,536 --> 01:03:02,981
I am the wife of
Rodion Pavlov.

813
01:03:03,047 --> 01:03:04,048
Come forward.

814
01:03:10,350 --> 01:03:13,353
I wish to know where
your husband is hiding,

815
01:03:13,378 --> 01:03:16,813
how many men he has with him
and how much ammunition.

816
01:03:18,415 --> 01:03:19,703
Yes?

817
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,670
I cannot answer
those questions.

818
01:03:22,706 --> 01:03:25,352
You are certain that
you will not answer?

819
01:03:26,458 --> 01:03:28,460
I am certain.

820
01:03:29,713 --> 01:03:31,215
Take her inside.

821
01:04:18,262 --> 01:04:22,266
Swine. Swine!

822
01:04:24,392 --> 01:04:26,393
I am a doctor.

823
01:04:26,590 --> 01:04:28,613
They will bring her out.

824
01:04:28,772 --> 01:04:31,582
Her right arm and her
right leg will be broken.

825
01:04:31,683 --> 01:04:33,776
You should advise your
people to give information

826
01:04:33,777 --> 01:04:34,778
when it is asked for.

827
01:04:34,803 --> 01:04:36,617
You are a doctor and
you are able to --

828
01:04:36,642 --> 01:04:39,258
in this new order of ours,
we have to countenance

829
01:04:39,283 --> 01:04:42,286
and commit many acts one does
not necessarily approve of.

830
01:05:20,485 --> 01:05:21,485
Shh.

831
01:05:55,651 --> 01:05:57,152
We'll have a look.

832
01:05:57,177 --> 01:05:59,179
We'll join you at
the crossroads.

833
01:06:26,086 --> 01:06:27,588
Wait.

834
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:30,799
Take Clavdia and Grisha
and hitch the horses.

835
01:06:30,824 --> 01:06:32,834
I can shoot. Do
what I tell you.

836
01:06:32,859 --> 01:06:34,836
If anything goes wrong,
then -- well, drive away.

837
01:06:34,861 --> 01:06:36,863
Don't wait. Just drive.

838
01:06:41,147 --> 01:06:44,651
The horses. Quick.
Hitch the horses.

839
01:06:50,266 --> 01:06:52,267
Frightened?

840
01:06:52,268 --> 01:06:53,281
I...

841
01:06:54,270 --> 01:06:55,734
Yes.

842
01:06:56,272 --> 01:06:57,547
Good.

843
01:06:58,274 --> 01:07:00,275
Only fools aren't frightened

844
01:07:00,276 --> 01:07:02,779
when there's something
to be frightened about.

845
01:07:03,289 --> 01:07:06,282
And I don't like to see
a fool hold a gun.

846
01:07:07,883 --> 01:07:09,785
Now, go on.

847
01:07:09,786 --> 01:07:11,617
And remember --

848
01:07:11,788 --> 01:07:13,789
you'll only have
a second to fire

849
01:07:13,790 --> 01:07:16,293
and you must be
quick and sure.

850
01:09:51,887 --> 01:09:53,238
Try to sleep.

851
01:09:53,491 --> 01:09:55,395
I'll watch.

852
01:10:01,538 --> 01:10:03,038
Planes?

853
01:10:03,063 --> 01:10:05,064
It's hard to tell.

854
01:10:05,089 --> 01:10:07,452
You get some sleep, my dear.

855
01:10:07,872 --> 01:10:10,569
Everything sounds
like planes to me.

856
01:10:11,423 --> 01:10:14,186
I think of Damian
and the children...

857
01:10:15,865 --> 01:10:17,867
Wherever they are.

858
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:21,152
And Kolya.

859
01:10:27,219 --> 01:10:29,221
You are quiet for you.

860
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:32,663
I haven't had any
sleep for 30 hours.

861
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,422
I've been on four
bombing trips today.

862
01:10:35,516 --> 01:10:37,016
You're my fifth.

863
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,542
How did you do?

864
01:10:38,583 --> 01:10:41,585
Well, I always do well.

865
01:10:41,610 --> 01:10:45,613
I got two planes...
Whole line of supplies.

866
01:10:45,638 --> 01:10:47,639
Got some big guns
near the river.

867
01:10:47,664 --> 01:10:49,166
Well, get ready
to do it again.

868
01:10:49,191 --> 01:10:50,693
We'll be over them
in three minutes.

869
01:10:50,718 --> 01:10:52,717
We'll see how good you are.

870
01:10:52,742 --> 01:10:54,243
Oh, I'm good.

871
01:10:54,533 --> 01:10:57,535
You must have heard about me.

872
01:10:57,560 --> 01:10:59,060
First flight, son?

873
01:10:59,085 --> 01:11:01,360
This is my first flight
in the war, Grandaddy.

874
01:11:01,385 --> 01:11:02,887
I was at home on leave.

875
01:11:05,195 --> 01:11:07,196
Well, don't get
shaky about it.

876
01:11:07,197 --> 01:11:09,199
I'll bring you
through all right.

877
01:11:16,707 --> 01:11:18,207
He talks that way.

878
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,709
I've been flying
with him for years.

879
01:11:19,710 --> 01:11:22,213
I'm used to it.

880
01:11:35,225 --> 01:11:37,227
I can blow those supply trucks.
What do you say?

881
01:11:37,271 --> 01:11:38,271
Save your bombs.

882
01:11:38,303 --> 01:11:39,805
This will make a
good strafing job.

883
01:11:39,830 --> 01:11:42,331
We're going down.

884
01:11:52,242 --> 01:11:54,745
Tanks. Tanks in
those trees ahead.

885
01:12:00,117 --> 01:12:02,403
Pilot, are you all right?

886
01:12:02,428 --> 01:12:03,930
Are you all right?!

887
01:12:06,007 --> 01:12:09,010
Gunner, they got the pilot.
Come forward at once.

888
01:12:53,672 --> 01:12:55,172
Sir.

889
01:12:55,173 --> 01:12:57,174
Where did you get it?
Are you bad?

890
01:12:57,175 --> 01:12:58,676
I don't know.

891
01:12:58,677 --> 01:13:00,177
I can't feel it.

892
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:03,603
Remember -- years
ago in training?

893
01:13:03,682 --> 01:13:06,185
They said when you couldn't
feel it, it was bad!

894
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,570
That's not true. That's all
talk. You hold on.

895
01:13:08,624 --> 01:13:10,625
We'll go over the road and
let go what we got left,

896
01:13:10,689 --> 01:13:12,329
and I'll have on the
ground in 10 minutes.

897
01:13:19,091 --> 01:13:21,593
We're badly clipped in the back.
It's worse than I thought.

898
01:13:21,594 --> 01:13:22,594
You crawl to the back.

899
01:13:22,595 --> 01:13:24,095
I'll let you know
when to bail out.

900
01:13:24,096 --> 01:13:25,597
No, never. Never been
frightened, I mean.

901
01:13:25,598 --> 01:13:27,599
Maybe there's something
the matter with me.

902
01:13:27,600 --> 01:13:29,102
All right. Crawl back now.

903
01:13:29,103 --> 01:13:31,102
If you can't open the
hatch, I'll do it for you.

904
01:13:31,103 --> 01:13:33,503
If the plane's too bad to land,
I'm gonna try something else.

905
01:13:33,606 --> 01:13:35,447
And it doesn't need more
than one man to do it.

906
01:13:35,521 --> 01:13:37,521
Now, don't argue and sound
brave and be a nuisance.

907
01:13:37,549 --> 01:13:38,549
I can do it alone.

908
01:13:38,611 --> 01:13:40,113
Get ready to jump!

909
01:13:44,617 --> 01:13:47,120
Well, you'd never
have made it anyway.

910
01:13:55,127 --> 01:13:57,009
I'll get ready for it.

911
01:13:57,074 --> 01:14:00,577
This is going to be for
my father and for me

912
01:14:00,633 --> 01:14:04,137
and for my village and for
people I've never seen.

913
01:14:05,113 --> 01:14:07,615
Those are big words.

914
01:14:07,640 --> 01:14:10,143
I guess I'll have to
stand by them now.

915
01:14:12,113 --> 01:14:14,615
I'm coming down, and
it's going to hurt you!

916
01:14:14,647 --> 01:14:16,648
And I'm coming down
just where I want to

917
01:14:16,649 --> 01:14:19,652
because I was a good bombardier
and a good pilot, too!

918
01:15:01,640 --> 01:15:04,643
The children were given their
supper at the hospital tonight.

919
01:15:04,671 --> 01:15:06,014
Good. They needed it.

920
01:15:09,181 --> 01:15:10,682
Why did they do that?

921
01:15:11,149 --> 01:15:13,137
There's been
nothing but bad bread.

922
01:15:13,206 --> 01:15:14,706
What? What, Anna?

923
01:15:14,731 --> 01:15:17,258
The children are still
at the hospital --

924
01:15:17,299 --> 01:15:20,301
in the hall, on the
benches where I saw them.

925
01:15:20,662 --> 01:15:22,937
Supper was over long ago.
Shh. Shh.

926
01:15:22,962 --> 01:15:24,124
What?

927
01:15:48,740 --> 01:15:49,997
Sasha.

928
01:15:50,742 --> 01:15:51,966
Shh.

929
01:15:55,247 --> 01:15:57,403
He says we are to stay here.

930
01:15:58,148 --> 01:15:59,648
He says we --

931
01:16:00,058 --> 01:16:02,417
Mischa and Sonya
went in there and...

932
01:16:16,549 --> 01:16:18,551
Forceps.

933
01:16:19,597 --> 01:16:20,598
Gauze.

934
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:36,216
No. Don't do that.

935
01:16:39,291 --> 01:16:40,793
No. Don't do that.

936
01:17:01,813 --> 01:17:02,814
Rag.

937
01:17:09,321 --> 01:17:10,750
Orderly!

938
01:17:11,758 --> 01:17:13,563
Guard! Guard!

939
01:17:13,621 --> 01:17:14,680
Guard!

940
01:17:15,377 --> 01:17:17,879
Take this man out. Put
him under arrest.

941
01:17:18,026 --> 01:17:21,531
Do not be so nervous,
Captain Richter.

942
01:17:22,498 --> 01:17:24,787
You are well guarded
in this room

943
01:17:24,812 --> 01:17:27,314
from the feeble attacks
of an old man.

944
01:17:27,339 --> 01:17:28,841
Dismissed!

945
01:17:30,677 --> 01:17:32,958
After you, Dr. Kurin.

946
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:37,864
I realize that this is difficult
for you to understand.

947
01:17:38,545 --> 01:17:41,215
But our plasma supply
was insufficient,

948
01:17:41,383 --> 01:17:44,223
so we have to take blood for our
wounded where we can get it

949
01:17:44,248 --> 01:17:46,751
and where the donor is
easiest to control.

950
01:17:48,269 --> 01:17:51,271
I was looking at your
hospital library today.

951
01:17:51,615 --> 01:17:55,253
I had forgotten that Kurin
the pathologist was Russian.

952
01:17:57,186 --> 01:17:59,972
Strange to find you in
this little village.

953
01:18:01,319 --> 01:18:04,464
You came to the University of
Leipzig to read your paper.

954
01:18:05,174 --> 01:18:08,135
Must have been...
30 years ago.

955
01:18:08,545 --> 01:18:11,784
I was a student, of course,
and not allowed to hear you.

956
01:18:12,156 --> 01:18:14,157
But I remember it.

957
01:18:14,239 --> 01:18:15,502
Cigarette?

958
01:18:16,294 --> 01:18:17,796
They said that men of medicine

959
01:18:17,821 --> 01:18:19,822
see all that can
happen to people.

960
01:18:20,026 --> 01:18:22,529
I'm an old man, and
I have seen much.

961
01:18:22,951 --> 01:18:24,453
But how can a doctor
bring himself

962
01:18:24,454 --> 01:18:26,453
to not only take
blood from children

963
01:18:27,078 --> 01:18:28,868
but to bleed them white?

964
01:18:29,424 --> 01:18:31,236
Comrade Kurin.

965
01:18:43,471 --> 01:18:44,973
This boy needs help.

966
01:18:45,567 --> 01:18:47,569
May I? Of course.

967
01:18:57,226 --> 01:18:58,312
Dr. Von Harden,

968
01:18:58,337 --> 01:19:00,487
do you mean that you're not
having this man arrested?

969
01:19:00,488 --> 01:19:03,490
If you wish to be a
warrior, Captain Richter,

970
01:19:03,491 --> 01:19:05,492
you must take chances
with your life.

971
01:19:05,493 --> 01:19:07,494
Dr. Kurin is a famous
man of science.

972
01:19:07,495 --> 01:19:11,499
He's not a man who kills and
therefore no danger to us.

973
01:19:27,892 --> 01:19:30,618
Halt! Who goes there?

974
01:19:30,751 --> 01:19:32,019
It's me -- Dr. Kurin.

975
01:19:32,191 --> 01:19:35,194
Advance to be recognized!

976
01:19:42,319 --> 01:19:43,490
The Kechins' boy.

977
01:19:43,515 --> 01:19:45,516
You recognize him, comrade.
Take me to Rodion.

978
01:19:45,533 --> 01:19:46,534
Yeah.

979
01:20:13,794 --> 01:20:16,796
Twenty trucks.
Now start counting.

980
01:20:16,797 --> 01:20:20,300
One, two, three, four, five,

981
01:20:20,301 --> 01:20:22,802
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

982
01:20:22,803 --> 01:20:24,805
Ten seconds. And
here they come.

983
01:20:48,950 --> 01:20:50,951
Twenty trucks,
then 10 seconds.

984
01:20:50,976 --> 01:20:52,478
Eight motorcycles
in 15 seconds.

985
01:20:52,978 --> 01:20:55,481
And more trucks without ammo.

986
01:21:08,081 --> 01:21:10,082
Yes. That's the track.

987
01:21:10,558 --> 01:21:12,937
Karp hasn't seen these
hills for 10 years,

988
01:21:12,938 --> 01:21:15,339
but he remembered
them as if --

989
01:21:15,364 --> 01:21:17,365
we'll go straight through
without stopping,

990
01:21:17,443 --> 01:21:18,943
and we'll be there.

991
01:21:18,944 --> 01:21:20,945
We'll have done our work.

992
01:21:21,196 --> 01:21:22,314
Yes.

993
01:21:23,449 --> 01:21:25,451
Your face has changed.

994
01:21:26,311 --> 01:21:27,957
And yours.

995
01:21:29,400 --> 01:21:32,407
Tired and hungry.

996
01:21:33,459 --> 01:21:35,392
You read about hunger,

997
01:21:35,674 --> 01:21:38,502
but you don't understand how bad
it is until it happens to you.

998
01:21:38,895 --> 01:21:41,531
If Karp and I can keep awake,
nothing else will matter.

999
01:21:41,608 --> 01:21:43,023
I can do some of the driving.

1000
01:21:43,064 --> 01:21:44,203
Not this time.

1001
01:21:44,684 --> 01:21:47,096
We'll be climbing.
It'll be hard.

1002
01:21:47,273 --> 01:21:49,274
You'll sleep on my shoulder.

1003
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:52,689
That'll make me feel
good, sure of myself.

1004
01:21:57,863 --> 01:22:00,175
Could I, Marina?

1005
01:22:00,200 --> 01:22:02,202
I've never...

1006
01:22:03,703 --> 01:22:05,205
Could I?

1007
01:22:34,124 --> 01:22:36,125
I'm going through the
woods to this side.

1008
01:22:36,694 --> 01:22:39,311
As their group of motorcycles
come around this turn,

1009
01:22:39,460 --> 01:22:41,366
I'm going to fire at them.

1010
01:22:41,391 --> 01:22:42,893
That'll stop the column.

1011
01:22:42,918 --> 01:22:44,417
You will be ready here.

1012
01:22:44,442 --> 01:22:47,946
As the firing starts, you will
take the wagons across the road.

1013
01:22:47,970 --> 01:22:49,469
The firing will
cover the noise,

1014
01:22:49,669 --> 01:22:52,275
and they'll not be
watching for you.

1015
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,803
They'll be busy with me.

1016
01:22:55,014 --> 01:22:56,015
I hope.

1017
01:23:05,486 --> 01:23:07,487
If two people were
there to fire,

1018
01:23:07,488 --> 01:23:08,990
one one side and one another,

1019
01:23:08,991 --> 01:23:10,990
it'll be a better
chance for you.

1020
01:23:10,991 --> 01:23:12,492
I'm coming with you.

1021
01:23:12,493 --> 01:23:14,996
It's not for us to talk of
what's best for one of us.

1022
01:23:14,997 --> 01:23:16,900
You're needed to
take home the guns.

1023
01:23:16,925 --> 01:23:18,926
That's what you must do
and what you will do.

1024
01:23:19,751 --> 01:23:21,501
When you hear the
firing, go across.

1025
01:23:22,486 --> 01:23:26,048
When it's over, I'll meet you
on the hill by the cow path.

1026
01:23:27,296 --> 01:23:29,799
On the hill by the cow path.

1027
01:23:38,448 --> 01:23:40,951
He's right, Marina.
It's the only way.

1028
01:24:23,501 --> 01:24:25,001
Soon now.

1029
01:24:25,026 --> 01:24:27,938
When you hear the firing, go
across as fast as you can.

1030
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:31,533
And remember to leave room
for me to cross next to you.

1031
01:24:37,302 --> 01:24:38,856
Grisha.

1032
01:24:39,407 --> 01:24:40,407
Where's Clavdia?

1033
01:24:40,542 --> 01:24:42,042
She's gone.

1034
01:24:42,318 --> 01:24:44,545
She went after Damian.

1035
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:45,850
I saw her.

1036
01:24:46,853 --> 01:24:47,944
Grisha.

1037
01:24:49,050 --> 01:24:51,051
Why didn't you -- I
must go find her.

1038
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:54,054
You must not go after her.
You must let her alone.

1039
01:24:54,055 --> 01:24:55,557
I saw her face.

1040
01:25:43,605 --> 01:25:45,136
Oh, Grandpa.

1041
01:25:45,161 --> 01:25:46,161
Anna.

1042
01:25:46,388 --> 01:25:49,391
Oh, somebody help me.

1043
01:25:49,623 --> 01:25:53,909
Make me do something right,
the way everybody else does.

1044
01:25:55,561 --> 01:25:58,064
Keep me from being
so frightened.

1045
01:25:59,526 --> 01:26:02,756
Keep me from crying, please.

1046
01:28:31,060 --> 01:28:33,061
Where are you hit?

1047
01:28:33,868 --> 01:28:35,107
Bad?

1048
01:28:41,734 --> 01:28:43,736
There are only two --

1049
01:28:54,223 --> 01:28:57,226
don't go, Marina. Wait
a few more minutes.

1050
01:29:08,017 --> 01:29:10,282
A dead kid and a fat girl.

1051
01:29:10,349 --> 01:29:13,158
All right. Signal
to them to go on.

1052
01:29:13,587 --> 01:29:16,090
The dangerous enemy
has been dealt with.

1053
01:29:16,357 --> 01:29:17,857
I'm going.

1054
01:29:18,104 --> 01:29:20,236
Stay here.

1055
01:29:48,134 --> 01:29:49,844
Blind.

1056
01:30:01,339 --> 01:30:03,214
Clavdia?

1057
01:30:49,195 --> 01:30:52,015
Come on. We just have time.

1058
01:31:04,960 --> 01:31:06,461
Is it bad?

1059
01:31:06,518 --> 01:31:08,429
No wounds on him.

1060
01:31:08,454 --> 01:31:09,582
Clavdia.

1061
01:31:09,615 --> 01:31:10,615
It's me -- Marina.

1062
01:31:10,654 --> 01:31:12,155
And Karp.

1063
01:31:12,297 --> 01:31:13,297
Clavdia.

1064
01:31:13,345 --> 01:31:15,132
Cla-- where is she?

1065
01:31:16,379 --> 01:31:17,617
Clavdia.

1066
01:31:20,532 --> 01:31:21,640
She's dead.

1067
01:31:22,283 --> 01:31:23,785
Clavdia.

1068
01:31:59,070 --> 01:32:00,071
Marina?

1069
01:32:00,220 --> 01:32:01,257
Yes?

1070
01:32:01,924 --> 01:32:02,924
Where are we?

1071
01:32:03,074 --> 01:32:05,312
Over the Yunageno Hills.

1072
01:32:05,514 --> 01:32:07,014
How much longer?

1073
01:32:07,078 --> 01:32:08,851
Not much more.

1074
01:32:10,081 --> 01:32:11,773
What time is it?

1075
01:32:13,084 --> 01:32:15,085
About 5:00.

1076
01:32:15,587 --> 01:32:16,999
5:00.

1077
01:32:19,090 --> 01:32:22,594
In the morning or --
or in the afternoon?

1078
01:32:57,503 --> 01:32:59,505
All right! All right!

1079
01:33:00,005 --> 01:33:02,006
You say Boris has not
come with the guns,

1080
01:33:02,007 --> 01:33:04,292
but they are your children, and
they're being bled to death!

1081
01:33:04,317 --> 01:33:06,239
Why, the whole
village will be --

1082
01:33:07,012 --> 01:33:09,515
our time has come to fight.

1083
01:33:10,015 --> 01:33:11,517
It does no good for me to lie.

1084
01:33:12,094 --> 01:33:16,098
Men with rocks and clubs are
not good against machine guns.

1085
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:18,783
Now, there will be
five men to a gun.

1086
01:33:18,808 --> 01:33:20,807
You know it, and I'll say it.

1087
01:33:20,853 --> 01:33:23,355
This may be the last time
we ride down a hill.

1088
01:33:23,529 --> 01:33:24,530
What do you say?

1089
01:33:26,336 --> 01:33:28,345
All right. Saddle your horses.

1090
01:33:31,435 --> 01:33:33,282
Take up your watch
at the pine grove.

1091
01:33:33,307 --> 01:33:35,087
And when Boris gets
here with the guns,

1092
01:33:35,112 --> 01:33:36,614
rush him down to the
north cornfield.

1093
01:33:37,028 --> 01:33:39,013
Pray that he arrives in time.

1094
01:34:25,184 --> 01:34:27,687
All right. The selected
men, dismount.

1095
01:34:30,635 --> 01:34:34,558
The rest of you wait here
until you see the gas aflame,

1096
01:34:34,600 --> 01:34:37,103
and then ride to the
schoolyard and ride fast.

1097
01:34:37,104 --> 01:34:39,957
Barricade it soon as you get in.

1098
01:34:53,908 --> 01:34:55,409
You know the plan.

1099
01:34:55,434 --> 01:34:57,814
Each group knows what to do.

1100
01:34:57,845 --> 01:34:58,962
Now let's do it.

1101
01:36:51,666 --> 01:36:53,556
All right. Now for
the gasoline.

1102
01:36:53,581 --> 01:36:55,837
Let's keep it pouring.

1103
01:38:27,996 --> 01:38:29,997
Down! We are fighting
in the village!

1104
01:38:29,998 --> 01:38:30,999
I'll take you!

1105
01:38:51,520 --> 01:38:54,023
They're our men!
They've come to fight.

1106
01:39:28,557 --> 01:39:31,560
Sophia, Nadya, our
children are home!

1107
01:39:32,474 --> 01:39:33,744
The children!

1108
01:39:33,769 --> 01:39:34,770
Nadya!

1109
01:39:48,076 --> 01:39:49,076
Grisha.

1110
01:39:49,077 --> 01:39:50,077
Anna!

1111
01:39:50,078 --> 01:39:52,080
My baby is home!

1112
01:39:57,930 --> 01:39:59,432
Damian, it's your mother.

1113
01:39:59,433 --> 01:40:01,086
Damian!

1114
01:40:12,444 --> 01:40:13,725
Mama.

1115
01:40:19,749 --> 01:40:20,819
Mama.

1116
01:40:29,928 --> 01:40:31,447
Grandpa!

1117
01:40:31,886 --> 01:40:32,887
Gran--

1118
01:42:05,801 --> 01:42:08,215
I have come for another
visit, Dr. Von Harden.

1119
01:42:08,375 --> 01:42:10,375
I'll only be a minute, doctor.

1120
01:42:12,644 --> 01:42:14,646
Sulfanilamide.

1121
01:42:21,419 --> 01:42:23,421
Come in, Dr. Kurin.

1122
01:42:27,242 --> 01:42:30,425
You do not like Dr. Richter.

1123
01:42:30,888 --> 01:42:33,856
I do not like
incompetent doctors.

1124
01:42:35,330 --> 01:42:37,832
I do not like much
of what I have done

1125
01:42:37,833 --> 01:42:38,834
for the past nine years.

1126
01:42:38,872 --> 01:42:41,874
You do not like bleeding
children to their death?

1127
01:42:42,188 --> 01:42:43,188
The boy died?

1128
01:42:43,221 --> 01:42:44,684
You knew he would die!

1129
01:42:45,864 --> 01:42:48,367
They took too much blood.

1130
01:42:48,844 --> 01:42:50,434
I am sorry for that.

1131
01:42:50,822 --> 01:42:54,254
Yes, I believe you when
you tell me you're sorry.

1132
01:42:55,717 --> 01:42:58,824
I'm sorry for many
things, Dr. Kurin.

1133
01:43:00,073 --> 01:43:02,575
Most sorry that it isn't
the world we used to know.

1134
01:43:03,355 --> 01:43:05,734
I have heard about
men like you --

1135
01:43:05,759 --> 01:43:08,863
civilized men who are sorry.

1136
01:43:08,888 --> 01:43:10,215
This?

1137
01:43:11,366 --> 01:43:13,367
This kind is nothing.

1138
01:43:13,368 --> 01:43:17,371
They will go when
their bosses go.

1139
01:43:17,372 --> 01:43:22,376
But men like you, who have
contempt for men like him --

1140
01:43:22,377 --> 01:43:25,880
to me, you are the real filth.

1141
01:43:25,881 --> 01:43:30,384
Men who do the work of fascists
while they pretend to themselves

1142
01:43:30,385 --> 01:43:34,254
that they are better than the
beasts for whom they work.

1143
01:43:34,279 --> 01:43:35,780
Men who do murder

1144
01:43:35,812 --> 01:43:39,246
while they laugh at those
who order them to do it.

1145
01:43:39,926 --> 01:43:43,430
It is men like you who have sold
their people to men like him.

1146
01:43:45,549 --> 01:43:47,550
You see, Dr. Von Harden,

1147
01:43:47,575 --> 01:43:50,578
you were wrong
about many things.

1148
01:43:51,234 --> 01:43:53,737
I am a man who kills.

1149
01:44:13,072 --> 01:44:15,405
You, uh, feel you'll
need this thing, huh?

1150
01:44:15,430 --> 01:44:16,622
I like it.

1151
01:44:17,799 --> 01:44:20,497
We will come home someday.

1152
01:44:20,522 --> 01:44:22,442
I want to sew again.

1153
01:44:23,125 --> 01:44:26,525
And you will want to
write your book again.

1154
01:44:26,942 --> 01:44:28,944
We are not so old.

1155
01:44:34,950 --> 01:44:37,012
They tell me you were
very brave, Grandpa.

1156
01:44:37,063 --> 01:44:38,100
And why not, child?

1157
01:44:38,125 --> 01:44:40,627
I'm of the same blood
as you and Clavdia.

1158
01:44:44,960 --> 01:44:46,460
It's gone.

1159
01:44:46,461 --> 01:44:48,410
There will be another someday.

1160
01:44:48,455 --> 01:44:49,455
Yes.

1161
01:44:50,273 --> 01:44:51,974
It will be different for us.

1162
01:44:51,999 --> 01:44:54,501
Wars don't leave
people as they were.

1163
01:44:54,970 --> 01:44:56,645
All people will learn this

1164
01:44:56,865 --> 01:44:59,910
and come to see that
wars do not have to be.

1165
01:45:01,382 --> 01:45:03,840
We'll make this the last war.

1166
01:45:05,480 --> 01:45:08,817
We'll make a free
world for all men.

1167
01:45:09,952 --> 01:45:14,472
The Earth belongs to us, the
people, if we fight for it.

1168
01:45:16,724 --> 01:45:18,726
And we will fight for it!
