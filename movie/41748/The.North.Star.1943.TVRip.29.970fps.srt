1
00:00:01,510 --> 00:00:03,010
The North Star (1943) 1hr 48min

2
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:28,154
Good morning, my
little honey bees.

3
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:30,156
Good morning!

4
00:01:30,157 --> 00:01:32,158
Good morning. Good morning.

5
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:33,661
Good morning, one and all.

6
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:35,661
Good... Morning!

7
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:37,164
Good morning!

8
00:01:55,682 --> 00:01:58,184
Anna!

9
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,186
Anna!

10
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:00,686
Anna!

11
00:02:00,687 --> 00:02:02,188
Where's Pavel Grigorich?

12
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,190
I've come to be your
guest for breakfast.

13
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:05,191
Stop shouting.

14
00:02:05,192 --> 00:02:06,694
Don't be so young
with the voice.

15
00:02:07,194 --> 00:02:08,696
You'll have to come
back, Comrade Karp.

16
00:02:08,697 --> 00:02:10,196
Grandpa is still asleep.

17
00:02:10,197 --> 00:02:12,700
A new baby came to the
hospital last night,

18
00:02:12,701 --> 00:02:14,700
and then Grandpa came
home and did his writing.

19
00:02:14,701 --> 00:02:15,701
Good morning.

20
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:18,204
That's not the way you say it.

21
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,207
You say, "a baby came
into the bright world

22
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:24,712
in the darkest part
of the night."

23
00:02:26,213 --> 00:02:28,714
Don't talk so pretty.

24
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:30,716
A new baby. Isn't that nice?

25
00:02:30,717 --> 00:02:32,218
What's nice about it?

26
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,220
I -- I'll be back.

27
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,721
You argue too much.

28
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:37,723
Heep!

29
00:02:37,724 --> 00:02:39,225
Good morning, Grandpa.

30
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:41,729
Ah. Good morning, my lad.

31
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,741
You should not have
worked all night.

32
00:02:55,242 --> 00:02:57,243
Mm. I had a good night's work.

33
00:02:57,244 --> 00:02:59,245
Did a little writing.

34
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:00,746
Feel better? Mm-hmm.

35
00:03:00,747 --> 00:03:02,749
Come and have breakfast now.

36
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:04,751
Oh, dear.

37
00:03:09,756 --> 00:03:12,758
What seems to be the
trouble, Boris Stepanich?

38
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:15,761
It'll take a better mechanic
than I am to answer that.

39
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:18,264
The patient is cured, Father.

40
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,265
It's all right now.

41
00:03:19,266 --> 00:03:20,766
Hello, Comrade Karp.

42
00:03:20,767 --> 00:03:22,768
You ever been to Kiev?
Of course.

43
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,772
There was a pretty girl there
who lost her head over me.

44
00:03:26,273 --> 00:03:28,274
Years ago. Oh, of course.

45
00:03:28,275 --> 00:03:31,277
Well, it is the
last day of school.

46
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:33,279
Tomorrow morning,
we'll be on our way.

47
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,282
It's our vacation, and we're
going to Kiev on a holiday.

48
00:03:36,283 --> 00:03:37,785
That's a nice bus ride.

49
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:39,285
Not for us. We're hiking.

50
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:41,288
All the way? Well, of course.

51
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,289
It'll only take us
four or five days.

52
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,790
Only?

53
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,292
Marina is going?

54
00:03:46,293 --> 00:03:49,295
Yes. Marina and
Clavdia and grisha.

55
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:51,797
My brother -- unfortunately.

56
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:55,302
Ah, but Marina is
the one who counts.

57
00:03:56,803 --> 00:03:57,803
Have you proposed?

58
00:03:57,804 --> 00:04:00,806
Or does one propose in
these modern times?

59
00:04:00,807 --> 00:04:02,308
Good morning, Papa.

60
00:04:02,309 --> 00:04:03,811
Good morning.

61
00:04:10,817 --> 00:04:12,818
What are you doing, Marina?

62
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,820
I'm baking honey
cakes for the trip.

63
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,822
The cakes have
to be baked now?

64
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,325
You're not leaving
until tomorrow.

65
00:04:19,326 --> 00:04:20,828
Well, it's hard at our age

66
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,829
to remember how
exciting a trip can be.

67
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,332
The planning is half the fun.

68
00:04:28,335 --> 00:04:30,838
A long time ago, this is
the way I wore my hair.

69
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:33,841
Were you pretty, Mama,
when you were young?

70
00:04:33,842 --> 00:04:35,841
I'm not so old, little one.

71
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,345
Mama's pretty now.
And she's not old.

72
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:40,346
It's only that
you're so young.

73
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:42,348
I'm not so young.

74
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:43,851
There are plenty
who are younger.

75
00:04:43,852 --> 00:04:45,352
Yes. And there always will be.

76
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:51,357
Sophia, when you go marketing,
remind everybody to come

77
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:53,861
and help with the
loading of the trains.

78
00:04:53,862 --> 00:04:55,861
Tell them there will
be supper for all

79
00:04:55,862 --> 00:04:56,902
when the work is finished.

80
00:04:57,364 --> 00:04:59,365
I'll tell everybody!
I'll tell everybody!

81
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,866
May I, Papa? May I?

82
00:05:00,867 --> 00:05:02,868
I'll do it on my
way to school.

83
00:05:02,869 --> 00:05:04,370
Please, may I? May I, please?

84
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,372
All right. You tell them.

85
00:05:06,373 --> 00:05:08,374
I'll say there will be
supper for everybody.

86
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:09,375
Yes.

87
00:05:09,376 --> 00:05:11,879
I'll say there will
be music and singing.

88
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,379
I'll say there
will be dancing,

89
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,381
and I'll say there will
be cider for old people

90
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,882
and fruit drinks for children.

91
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:18,885
You might also remember to
say there will be work.

92
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,887
Oh.

93
00:05:21,888 --> 00:05:23,889
Yes. I'll say that, too.

94
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:27,894
"Everybody must
work," I'll say.

95
00:05:28,895 --> 00:05:30,896
No pancakes?

96
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:33,899
You know what else the comrade
commander said to me?

97
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:36,402
You have my permission
not to tell me.

98
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:38,404
"Eat pancakes."
That's what he said.

99
00:05:38,405 --> 00:05:40,406
It has been
recently discovered

100
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:42,910
that pancakes are fine for
a bombardier's nerves.

101
00:05:42,911 --> 00:05:44,410
That ought to
interest you, Damian.

102
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,913
You're going to be a doctor.

103
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:48,914
It doesn't interest me.

104
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,916
Don't worry with
those maps, Damian.

105
00:05:50,917 --> 00:05:52,418
I know all the roads.

106
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,921
And when we get to Kiev,

107
00:05:53,922 --> 00:05:57,424
I will show you and your little
friends all there is to see.

108
00:05:57,924 --> 00:06:00,926
Me and my little friends
are still young.

109
00:06:00,927 --> 00:06:01,927
A visit to Kiev

110
00:06:01,928 --> 00:06:04,430
is something that doesn't
happen to us every day.

111
00:06:04,431 --> 00:06:06,932
And don't patronize
us about it.

112
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,934
Be a man of the world in
front of your mirror.

113
00:06:08,935 --> 00:06:10,936
It's better that way.
Mirrors don't talk back.

114
00:06:10,937 --> 00:06:12,438
Hmm!

115
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:15,943
Most men in the world feel
pleased when they have sons.

116
00:06:15,944 --> 00:06:16,943
I wonder why.

117
00:06:16,944 --> 00:06:18,944
I told you years ago.

118
00:06:18,945 --> 00:06:21,947
Two quiet little girls
would have been very nice.

119
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,950
Well, you can't change us now,
and you wouldn't if you could.

120
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:27,953
Two healthy, brilliant,
handsome sons.

121
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:30,956
June 20, 1941, 8:00 A.M.,

122
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,958
broadcasting from moscow.
Be still, both of you.

123
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:37,963
German troop movements are
reported on the Polish border.

124
00:06:37,964 --> 00:06:39,965
Their nature is unknown.

125
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,967
Reports reach us of
a typhus epidemic

126
00:06:41,968 --> 00:06:43,969
in the German-occupied
city of Warsaw.

127
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:46,973
London was bombed twice last
night by the Luftwaffe.

128
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:48,976
In the Polish city of Lodz,

129
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:52,478
112 Polish children died
this morning as a result

130
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,983
of being made to give blood
transfusions to German wounded.

131
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:58,984
Children. Taking blood from...

132
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:01,488
Here's a report from a
reliable source in --

133
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,007
goodbye, now.

134
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,008
Goodbye, sweetheart.

135
00:07:23,009 --> 00:07:24,010
Goodbye, Papa. Bye, baby.

136
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:26,512
Goodbye, Papa.

137
00:07:26,513 --> 00:07:28,015
Bye, Mama. Bye, dear.

138
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:35,020
Come on, Clavdia!
You'll be late!

139
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:36,523
You're my brother,
not my guardian.

140
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:38,525
Mind your business.

141
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,028
Good morning, Clavdia.

142
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,030
Good morning, Marina.

143
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:46,031
You're early.

144
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:48,034
Oh! You know I never
eat breakfast.

145
00:07:49,536 --> 00:07:51,537
You always look so clean.

146
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,539
You're no cleaner than I am.

147
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,542
Maybe not as clean.
And hair is curly.

148
00:07:56,543 --> 00:07:58,043
Your hair looks nice.

149
00:07:58,044 --> 00:08:00,046
Oh, it's as straight as wheat.

150
00:08:00,547 --> 00:08:02,549
And don't try to console me.

151
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:07,052
Well, well.

152
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:09,555
The last day of school
is a happy day.

153
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,556
Even I remember.

154
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,057
Oh, no. No?

155
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,060
We're very sorry
it's the last day.

156
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:58,103
My first words will
be to congratulate

157
00:08:58,104 --> 00:09:00,606
our three pupils
in the last class

158
00:09:00,607 --> 00:09:02,608
who have all been
awarded scholarships

159
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:05,112
to the state
University of Kiev.

160
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,615
One of those three has
taken the highest marks

161
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:13,620
of any pupil in this
year's senior graduating class.

162
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,122
He is Damian Taratsa.

163
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:29,635
It is not my custom to start
your vacation with a lecture.

164
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:34,640
But this is the summer
of 1941, a solemn time.

165
00:09:34,641 --> 00:09:37,144
No one of us knows
what will happen.

166
00:09:38,645 --> 00:09:40,147
I don't have to remind you

167
00:09:40,148 --> 00:09:44,149
that we are people
with a noble history.

168
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:46,652
You are expected to
carry on that history

169
00:09:46,653 --> 00:09:50,657
with complete devotion
and self-sacrifice.

170
00:09:51,157 --> 00:09:53,159
I think you'll do that.

171
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,664
And now... Have a happy summer.

185
00:11:37,263 --> 00:11:40,265
I-I can't explain it, but,
well, I-I almost wish

186
00:11:40,266 --> 00:11:42,768
we weren't having
this supper tonight.

187
00:11:42,769 --> 00:11:44,770
Oh, goodness knows
I usually love it.

188
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:46,273
But -- but it
interferes, really,

189
00:11:46,274 --> 00:11:48,274
with the trip, if you
know what I mean.

190
00:11:48,775 --> 00:11:50,277
Too many good things at once.

191
00:11:50,278 --> 00:11:52,277
Mm. I felt it, too.

192
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:53,779
I didn't want
anything to happen.

193
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:55,282
Just the trip. Nothing else.

194
00:11:55,283 --> 00:11:57,282
Oh, well. We really won't
celebrate tonight.

195
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,785
We'll just eat supper and act
like it was any other evening

196
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,288
and we were home
with the family.

197
00:12:01,289 --> 00:12:04,290
You know what? I'm not
going to sing tonight.

198
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,792
Even if everyone asks
me, I won't sing.

199
00:12:06,793 --> 00:12:09,296
And don't you sing either.
Mnh-mnh.

I wish it was

222
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:56,621
Kolya says we'll go to the
theater when we get to Kiev.

223
00:14:56,963 --> 00:14:59,466
All we have to do is
apply for the tickets.

224
00:14:59,467 --> 00:15:00,966
We'll have three
whole days in Kiev.

225
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,968
We shall see everything.

226
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:04,970
It's been a good year.

227
00:15:04,971 --> 00:15:08,475
Scholarship to the university,
of course, means the most.

228
00:15:08,476 --> 00:15:10,976
There was a medal
for marksmanship.

229
00:15:10,977 --> 00:15:12,979
And now this vacation.

230
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,982
We'll be separated for a year.

231
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:19,985
You'll be getting a scholarship
the following year.

232
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:22,489
But it's this year
I'm thinking about.

233
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,990
That's a long time.

234
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,993
I don't think it
is at our age.

235
00:15:27,994 --> 00:15:29,494
You don't think so?

236
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,497
How strange.

237
00:15:31,998 --> 00:15:33,999
What are you saying, Marina?

238
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,504
Nothing. I don't want
to talk about it.

239
00:15:39,505 --> 00:15:44,509
It's odd you don't think a year
away from me is a long time.

240
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,511
It doesn't worry you?

241
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,513
No.

242
00:15:48,514 --> 00:15:50,015
All right.

243
00:15:50,016 --> 00:15:53,019
You don't have to keep
saying it over and over.

244
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:57,023
Are you sure you feel
about me as you used to?

245
00:15:58,024 --> 00:16:00,527
I don't like this talk.
It -- it's bad.

246
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:03,029
It's only natural that I --
it's not natural at all.

247
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,031
It's not like you.

248
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:08,533
I've loved you since I was
old enough to see you.

249
00:16:08,534 --> 00:16:11,036
I will love you until I die.

250
00:16:11,037 --> 00:16:12,537
That's the way it is,

251
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,040
and there's no need
to talk about it.

252
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,041
You mean you'll never
talk about it?

253
00:16:16,042 --> 00:16:17,542
You'll never tell me?

254
00:16:17,543 --> 00:16:20,045
I'll tell you in my own time.

255
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:22,549
But I'll not tell
you to waste time.

256
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:24,050
Look here, Marina.

257
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,052
You and I are -- are
like one person.

258
00:16:27,053 --> 00:16:30,056
And I always thought you wanted
both of us to be educated and --

259
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,556
I didn't mean that.

260
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:33,558
Of course I want you to
go to the university.

261
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:35,060
Of course.

262
00:16:35,061 --> 00:16:37,062
It'd make me sad
if you didn't --

263
00:16:37,063 --> 00:16:38,063
and ashamed.

264
00:16:38,064 --> 00:16:39,566
But it wouldn't matter.

265
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:41,066
I'd go anyway.

266
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:44,069
I'm a citizen of this country.

267
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,071
I intend to go forward
with it and --

268
00:16:46,072 --> 00:16:48,073
and to give it all I have.

269
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:50,575
I have strong
feelings about it.

270
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,078
You'll come along
with those feelings.

271
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:56,583
But... You don't
come before them.

272
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,084
I understand.

273
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:03,590
I feel the same way for
myself, for both of us.

274
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:06,091
I was being foolish.

275
00:17:06,092 --> 00:17:08,093
I only wanted to be with you.

276
00:17:08,094 --> 00:17:11,096
I'm proud you got the
scholarship, of course.

277
00:17:11,097 --> 00:17:12,097
You'll be a great man,

278
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:14,601
and the whole district
will be proud of you.

279
00:17:14,602 --> 00:17:16,101
You'll have medals.

280
00:17:16,102 --> 00:17:18,103
I think we'll go to the
theater every night.

281
00:17:18,104 --> 00:17:19,105
That's too often.

282
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,106
And we'll grow old together,

283
00:17:21,107 --> 00:17:23,610
and I'll be a beautiful
old woman and very kind.

284
00:17:23,611 --> 00:17:25,110
Oh, I'm sure of it.

285
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:27,612
My grandchildren will love me,

286
00:17:27,613 --> 00:17:30,115
and you will, too,
more than ever.

287
00:17:30,116 --> 00:17:31,618
What's wrong with that?

288
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:33,118
Plenty of people
grow old together

289
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,621
and have a fine
life behind them.

290
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:37,624
I didn't say there was
anything wrong with it.

291
00:17:41,127 --> 00:17:43,628
I shall buy baby
dresses in Kiev.

292
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,130
For whom?

293
00:17:45,131 --> 00:17:47,133
For our first...

294
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:50,135
Our grandchildren.

295
00:17:50,136 --> 00:17:51,636
Oh.

296
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:56,141
You'll, um, you'll put the
dresses away for a while?

297
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:58,645
Yes. Of course
that's what I mean.

298
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:17,222
When we get home, you and
I should call a meeting,

299
00:19:17,223 --> 00:19:19,726
and the five of us should
go over all the plans

300
00:19:19,727 --> 00:19:21,226
for our journey tomorrow.

301
00:19:21,227 --> 00:19:23,728
Don't you think, Kolya?

302
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:25,230
I don't need to plan

303
00:19:25,231 --> 00:19:27,734
to get up and get dressed
and eat my breakfast.

304
00:19:27,735 --> 00:19:29,234
I know how to do that.

305
00:19:29,235 --> 00:19:33,238
I'm getting tired of hearing you
children talk about this trip.

306
00:19:33,239 --> 00:19:35,240
I'm only going because
Father made me.

307
00:19:35,241 --> 00:19:36,741
Oh.

308
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,246
Oh, I thought it was because
-- well, because me.

309
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,747
I-I mean us.

310
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,750
Don't you like us?

311
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,253
No.

312
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,254
Oh.

313
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:51,756
What's the matter
with you, Clavdia?

314
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:55,260
I-I have a choking
sensation in my chest.

315
00:19:55,261 --> 00:19:56,761
You eat too much.

316
00:19:56,762 --> 00:19:58,263
You usually do.

317
00:19:58,264 --> 00:19:59,764
It's not at all that.

318
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:02,268
It's my emotions in the chest.

319
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:06,271
Clavdia, you're a throwback.

320
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:07,774
What's that? What do you mean?

321
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:10,777
Somebody who doesn't
belong to their own time.

322
00:20:10,778 --> 00:20:14,779
Ours is a new world, Clavdia.
You don't belong in it.

323
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,281
Oh, I see.

324
00:20:16,282 --> 00:20:18,283
You mean I'm rather
old-fashioned

325
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:20,286
and romantic, rather.

326
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:22,789
Yeah.

327
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,355
No.

328
00:21:30,356 --> 00:21:33,359
I've told you -- you
cannot come along.

329
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,861
I'm always too young.

330
00:21:36,862 --> 00:21:39,364
I'm too young for everything.

331
00:21:39,365 --> 00:21:44,369
Well, someday, when everybody
else is too old for everything,

332
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,372
you'll be just old enough.

333
00:22:16,402 --> 00:22:17,904
Take care of the puppy.

334
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:19,904
I'll bring everybody
a present.

335
00:22:19,905 --> 00:22:21,406
Don't get your feet wet.

336
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:23,408
And take care of yourselves.

337
00:22:23,409 --> 00:22:26,911
Goodbye.

338
00:22:26,912 --> 00:22:27,912
Goodbye!

339
00:22:27,913 --> 00:22:29,414
Papa.

340
00:22:29,415 --> 00:22:31,417
Goodbye.

341
00:22:45,431 --> 00:22:49,934
The first time we have ever
been separated, Grandpa.

342
00:22:49,935 --> 00:22:52,938
It's only for a short time.

343
00:22:58,944 --> 00:23:02,447
Good morning.

344
00:23:02,448 --> 00:23:04,450
Clumsy in the body are
those clumsy in the head.

345
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:05,950
You wake Grandpa and I'll --

346
00:23:05,951 --> 00:23:07,952
oh, I'm gonna kill you,
you nasty little thing.

347
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:08,953
I'm gonna kill you.

348
00:23:08,954 --> 00:23:10,956
Drink your milk, Clavdia.

349
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:21,467
You will now find it more
comfortable to get up.

350
00:23:23,469 --> 00:23:25,470
Goodbye, Father.

351
00:23:25,471 --> 00:23:27,972
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

352
00:23:27,973 --> 00:23:30,975
Seven times last night
you said goodbye.

353
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:31,977
We'll be back soon.

354
00:23:32,478 --> 00:23:34,979
We'll try to get
along without you.

355
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,982
Well, goodbye!

356
00:23:37,983 --> 00:23:40,486
Oh, Mother.

357
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:42,987
We'll be back soon.

358
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:44,490
Oh, have a good time, son.

359
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:45,491
We'll miss you.

360
00:23:45,492 --> 00:23:47,994
Damian?

361
00:23:49,495 --> 00:23:52,497
Damian!

362
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,000
Coming!

363
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:00,505
Good journey, Marina.

364
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:02,008
Good journey.

365
00:24:02,508 --> 00:24:07,512
Good journey! Good journey!

366
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,013
Good journey!

367
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:11,015
Good journey to us all!

368
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,016
Kolya!

369
00:24:12,017 --> 00:24:13,518
Good morning, Kolya.

370
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:15,021
- Good morning!
- Hello.

371
00:24:15,022 --> 00:24:17,022
Good morning, good
morning, good morning.

372
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:19,023
Hey!

373
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:20,526
Good morning, Clavdia.

374
00:24:30,536 --> 00:24:33,538
What's the matter with you?
With your face?

375
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,041
You look so foolish.

376
00:24:35,541 --> 00:24:37,543
Well, you never said "good
morning" to me before.

377
00:24:38,043 --> 00:24:39,544
Good morning!

378
00:24:39,545 --> 00:24:41,045
Good morning, Kolya.

379
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:42,548
Good morning!

380
00:24:44,550 --> 00:24:46,052
I don't like guns, Kolya.

381
00:24:46,053 --> 00:24:47,053
Then don't have one.

382
00:24:47,553 --> 00:24:48,553
I don't like the
noise they make.

383
00:24:48,554 --> 00:24:51,055
Who does? Why are
you carrying it?

384
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,058
If you look at me, Clavdia, you
will see that I'm in uniform.

385
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,560
Men in uniform carry guns.

386
00:24:55,561 --> 00:24:57,562
Uniforms, air force,

387
00:24:57,563 --> 00:24:59,564
Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics.

388
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,065
Remember now?

389
00:25:01,066 --> 00:25:04,068
Oh, you're teasing me.

390
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:06,070
Well, don't play with
that gun, please.

391
00:25:06,071 --> 00:25:07,572
I intend to use it.

392
00:25:07,573 --> 00:25:09,574
When we near the
end of the trip,

393
00:25:09,575 --> 00:25:10,576
I intend to kill someone

394
00:25:11,076 --> 00:25:12,577
and leave their carcass
for the hawks.

395
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:13,579
You want to help?

396
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,080
Oh, no. No. I will stop you.

397
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,082
I-I will sacrifice myself.

398
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:21,586
Oh, I couldn't stand to
think of you lying in jail,

399
00:25:21,587 --> 00:25:24,090
a murderer, tortured
with conscience.

400
00:25:24,091 --> 00:25:25,590
Oh, Kolya.

401
00:25:25,591 --> 00:25:27,592
I've got to kill him. But who?

402
00:25:27,593 --> 00:25:28,594
Damian.

403
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:35,601

Don't your feet hurt?

442
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,236
In the army, your feet
learn to stop hurting.

443
00:27:52,237 --> 00:27:55,239
I told you young athletes not
to walk so far and so fast

444
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,240
the first day.

445
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:59,244
Make a fire.

446
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:02,747
We must have a fire.

447
00:28:02,748 --> 00:28:05,751
A fire is so romantic.

448
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,756
Oh, we must have a fire.

449
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:15,259
Otherwise, we can't
sit around and dream.

450
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,763
Maybe it would be
better to kill you.

451
00:29:45,851 --> 00:29:49,854
Do, um, do all men make
noises when they sleep?

452
00:29:49,855 --> 00:29:51,857
I don't know. I never
listen to all men.

453
00:29:59,364 --> 00:30:00,364
Hey, it's Karp.

454
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,366
Oh! Karp!

455
00:30:02,367 --> 00:30:04,869
Good morning, Karp!
Good morning!

456
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,373
Good morning. Good morning.
I thought we'd pass you.

457
00:30:07,374 --> 00:30:08,873
We're on our way home.

458
00:30:08,874 --> 00:30:10,376
I'll give you a ride
to the crossroads.

459
00:30:10,377 --> 00:30:12,376
Good! It's time for a ride.

460
00:30:12,377 --> 00:30:14,879
You can't go on a walking trip
and take a ride. You can't.

461
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,881
Well, you see
more if you walk,

462
00:30:16,882 --> 00:30:18,883
but we'd only be
riding a few miles.

463
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,384
Oh, come on.

464
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:22,888
And riding's good
for the feet.

465
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:42,907
Well, well. Nothing
like having good feet.

466
00:30:42,908 --> 00:30:44,408
My feet are not good.

467
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,410
They're much too small.
Everybody knows that.

468
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:47,913
I think we should walk.

469
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:50,414
You can't go on a walking
trip and take a ride.

470
00:30:50,415 --> 00:30:51,916
Who made up that law?

471
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:53,419
It's not a law. It's just --

472
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,920
well, it's --
it's not romantic.

473
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:56,921
I see.

474
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,924
You and Marina walk.
We men will ride.

475
00:30:59,925 --> 00:31:01,427
Would you ride while I walked?

476
00:31:01,428 --> 00:31:04,428
Darling Marina, I'm
not making you walk.

477
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:06,430
But would you let me
walk while you rode?

478
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:08,432
The brightest of women
are not bright.

479
00:31:08,433 --> 00:31:09,934
I'm learning that.

480
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:10,935
We are women.

481
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:12,937
Different things go
on in our heads.

482
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,440
That's what makes
us attractive.

483
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:16,440
You coming?

484
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,443
If you're quite
certain you want me.

485
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,949
A fine marriage yours will be.

486
00:31:24,950 --> 00:31:26,951
Boss you and then
laugh at you.

487
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:28,452
Oh, come on, Clavdia.

488
00:31:28,453 --> 00:31:30,454
When you don't stand
by your convictions,

489
00:31:30,455 --> 00:31:32,957
you set back the cause of all
women everywhere in the world.

490
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,959
She's an interesting
type, Clavdia.

491
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,962
Like a piece in a museum.

492
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,483

501
00:32:34,019 --> 00:32:37,021
Your pig doesn't smell so
nice now that the sun is up.

502
00:32:37,022 --> 00:32:38,522
And who does?

507
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:54,038
What?

508
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:56,540
Something the matter
with the sun.

509
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:59,044
Is that an old saying, Karp?

510
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:03,047
What's wrong with the sun?
Tell me what you mean.

511
00:33:03,048 --> 00:33:04,548
I don't know.

512
00:33:04,549 --> 00:33:06,050

00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,057
Stop that singing, please!

516
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:16,060
What's the matter with you?
Why shouldn't we sing?

517
00:33:16,061 --> 00:33:17,563
Because I've been
hearing something!

518
00:33:17,564 --> 00:33:19,563
You've been hearing
your own head.

519
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,065
A wit.

520
00:33:21,066 --> 00:33:22,067
I hear it.

521
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:24,568
I've been hearing
it for an hour.

522
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:26,570
But I don't know.

523
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:30,074
Sometimes I hear things
from other years.

524
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:33,577
Sometimes I even forget
what year it is.

525
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:36,580
1914, 1915 --

526
00:33:36,581 --> 00:33:39,584
or 1941.

527
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,587
What are you
carrying on about?

528
00:33:43,588 --> 00:33:46,090
We can all hear it.
They're planes.

529
00:33:46,091 --> 00:33:48,092
And you ought to know
what planes sound like.

530
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:50,596
They're many planes, and
they're not far from here.

531
00:33:50,597 --> 00:33:52,596
Can't we have an air force
while you're on leave?

532
00:33:52,597 --> 00:33:55,099
You should have let Grandpa
examine your head.

533
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:57,603
Maybe there's something
wrong inside.

534
00:34:01,106 --> 00:34:02,608
Whoa!

535
00:34:03,108 --> 00:34:05,110
Whoa.

536
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:50,155
Get down! All of you!
Get down immediately!

537
00:34:51,656 --> 00:34:54,159
We're being bombed!
Understand that! Quickly!

538
00:34:56,661 --> 00:35:01,166
Get out of your wagons and get
into the ditch immediately!

539
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:06,670
Leave the horses.
Get in the ditch!

540
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:08,172
I don't believe you. We
can't leave the horses.

541
00:35:08,173 --> 00:35:10,676
I intend to use this gun on
anybody who isn't in that ditch.

542
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:25,250
Marina.

543
00:37:12,297 --> 00:37:13,797
Will he --

544
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,299
I don't know yet. I
don't think he --

545
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:17,301
let me. No.

546
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:20,305
You take a drink
of water, child.

547
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:36,820
Both of you... Close your
eyes and take my arm.

548
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,824
The face of war is ugly
and not for the young.

549
00:37:40,825 --> 00:37:43,828
We are not young anymore.

550
00:38:21,366 --> 00:38:23,367
Any better?

551
00:38:23,368 --> 00:38:24,870
No.

552
00:38:27,372 --> 00:38:29,373
Clavdia?

553
00:38:29,374 --> 00:38:31,375
No.

554
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:35,379
I guess it's the first time in
my life I haven't been hungry.

555
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,884
Oh, yesterday we were home,
and everybody in the --

556
00:38:39,884 --> 00:38:44,388
one day you're home,
and the next day...

557
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:47,391
The next day, here you are.

558
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:51,395
Last week, the little boy was
in the store with his mother.

559
00:38:51,396 --> 00:38:53,397
I met them there.

560
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:54,898
He had a ball,

561
00:38:54,899 --> 00:38:57,902
and he was bouncing it
with his left hand.

562
00:38:58,403 --> 00:39:01,905
I remember because I
noticed he was left-handed

563
00:39:01,906 --> 00:39:04,408
and wondered what it felt
like to be left-handed.

564
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:07,411
And now there he is
without his left hand.

565
00:39:07,412 --> 00:39:09,414
Without the hand that
bounced the ball!

566
00:39:09,914 --> 00:39:12,416
Oh! I shouldn't be
talking this way!

567
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,917
I know it!

568
00:39:13,918 --> 00:39:15,919
You're all ashamed of me.

569
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,422
You are what you are, Clavdia.

570
00:39:18,423 --> 00:39:20,926
It is my opinion that the
trouble in the world

571
00:39:20,927 --> 00:39:22,926
comes from people who
don't know what they are,

572
00:39:22,927 --> 00:39:25,430
who pretend to be
something they're not.

573
00:39:27,432 --> 00:39:28,932
Come on, Clavdia.

574
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:29,933
I'll wash your face.

575
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,936
Dirty cheeks.

576
00:39:34,939 --> 00:39:35,939
Go back.

577
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:39,444
It's over. There
is nothing to do.

578
00:40:04,469 --> 00:40:06,470
Good morning, Nadya.

579
00:40:06,471 --> 00:40:08,472
Well, how do you feel?

580
00:40:08,473 --> 00:40:11,475
I always wanted to know
how the doctor felt.

581
00:40:11,476 --> 00:40:13,977
I'm very glad to have a patient.

582
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,979
People around here
are too healthy.

583
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,980
You like your baby?

584
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:19,984
Oh, she's very ugly,
like her father.

585
00:40:21,486 --> 00:40:22,988
And beautiful.

586
00:40:56,521 --> 00:40:59,524
Olga!

587
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:39,063
Commander Petrov of the
12th Border Cavalry

588
00:41:39,564 --> 00:41:41,565
speaking to the
border villages.

589
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:43,068
The fascist armies
of the German Reich

590
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:45,068
invaded the Soviet
Union this morning.

591
00:41:45,069 --> 00:41:46,570
I will repeat.

592
00:41:46,571 --> 00:41:48,073
German armies crossed the border

593
00:41:48,074 --> 00:41:50,073
of the Soviet Union
this morning.

594
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:53,076
The attack was made with
unprecedented fury.

595
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:54,578
But our land will be defended

596
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:57,581
with a fury the fascist
armies have never known.

597
00:41:57,582 --> 00:42:01,086
To the border villages,
salute, comrades.

598
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,088
The war has come.

599
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:43,687
Comrades, we have good reason to
know that our country is at war.

600
00:43:43,688 --> 00:43:47,691
In our small village alone,
30 people have been injured.

601
00:43:47,692 --> 00:43:50,694
Eleven people have been killed.

602
00:43:50,695 --> 00:43:53,697
But this is not a
time for mourning.

603
00:43:53,698 --> 00:43:57,200
It is time for revenge.

604
00:43:57,201 --> 00:43:59,703
We will divide into two groups,

605
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,706
each to do his duty from
this day until death.

606
00:44:02,707 --> 00:44:05,210
The able-bodied men
are to come forward

607
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:07,711
to the right of this building.

608
00:44:07,712 --> 00:44:09,713
We will move from the
village to the hills

609
00:44:09,714 --> 00:44:11,715
and take our position
as guerrillas.

610
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:13,717
I will go immediately

611
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:17,722
to Comrade Commander
Petrov's Garrison to get the guns.

612
00:44:19,724 --> 00:44:23,727
The second group has
the hardest job.

613
00:44:23,728 --> 00:44:26,231
They must stay behind.

614
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:30,235
As guerrillas, we must
have aid and information.

615
00:44:31,736 --> 00:44:36,241
As villagers, you must, before
the entrance of the Germans,

616
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,742
destroy everything.

617
00:44:38,743 --> 00:44:40,243
Everything, comrades.

618
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,746
The houses you have built,

619
00:44:42,747 --> 00:44:44,748
the crops you have
sowed with your hands,

620
00:44:44,749 --> 00:44:47,751
the cattle you have raised.

621
00:44:47,752 --> 00:44:51,256
The Germans are not more
than 50 miles away.

622
00:44:52,256 --> 00:44:55,759
Yours is the dangerous job.

623
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:59,763
For this job, you
will volunteer.

624
00:44:59,764 --> 00:45:03,768
It is you who may have
to live with the...

625
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,772
...the Germans.

626
00:45:23,287 --> 00:45:26,290
"I, who am about to become
a guerrilla fighter

627
00:45:26,791 --> 00:45:29,793
of the Soviet Union, I
take this solemn oath."

628
00:45:29,794 --> 00:45:32,796
I, who am about to become
a guerrilla fighter

629
00:45:32,797 --> 00:45:36,800
of the Soviet Union, I
take this solemn oath.

630
00:45:36,801 --> 00:45:39,302
"I will not lay down these arms

631
00:45:39,303 --> 00:45:41,806
until the last fascist is
driven from our land."

632
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,809
I will not lay down these arms

633
00:45:45,309 --> 00:45:48,311
until the last fascist
is driven from our land.

634
00:45:48,312 --> 00:45:52,315
"I am willing to give my
life, to die in battle

635
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:54,819
to keep my people from
fascist slavery."

636
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:59,823
I am willing to give my
life, to die in battle

637
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:03,828
to keep my people
from fascist slavery.

638
00:46:30,354 --> 00:46:32,355
You know where we'll be.

639
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:36,359
One of us will come every
night to the pine grove.

640
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,362
Remember, we'll need
supplies and information.

641
00:46:39,363 --> 00:46:42,866
This is our land, our village!

642
00:46:42,867 --> 00:46:46,371
We remember we fought another
war to make them ours.

643
00:46:46,372 --> 00:46:48,872
We swear to give our
lives if they be needed.

644
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:51,376
We swear!

661
00:48:21,465 --> 00:48:22,465
I'm ready, Comrade Petrov.

662
00:48:22,466 --> 00:48:23,967
Good. Now, just a moment.

663
00:48:23,968 --> 00:48:25,969
These reports show the
Germans rapidly advancing

664
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:26,970
across our territory.

665
00:48:26,971 --> 00:48:28,972
By nightfall, there
won't be a highway

666
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:30,475
free of their guns,
their tanks,

667
00:48:30,476 --> 00:48:32,976
and their supply trucks,
all going to the front.

668
00:48:32,977 --> 00:48:34,737
Remember, you have a
good 40 miles to travel.

669
00:48:34,979 --> 00:48:36,481
Your best chance is to
take to the back road.

670
00:48:36,482 --> 00:48:37,981
That'll take too long.

671
00:48:37,982 --> 00:48:39,484
I'll have to take a
chance on the highway.

672
00:48:39,485 --> 00:48:41,484
We need that ammunition
bad and quick.

673
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:43,987
I'll get the truck through.
You can count on it.

674
00:48:43,988 --> 00:48:45,490
Good.

675
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,002
Comrade Karp is going
to take my place.

676
00:48:59,003 --> 00:49:01,506
My duty is to report to
the nearest airfield.

677
00:49:01,507 --> 00:49:04,007
So gather around,
listen closely,

678
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:06,511
and I'll show you what I
think is your only chance

679
00:49:06,512 --> 00:49:08,011
to get back to the village.

680
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:10,515
The Germans must have crossed
the river at the upper bend,

681
00:49:10,516 --> 00:49:12,516
and --

682
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:17,021
get down, everybody!

683
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,085
Father!

684
00:50:22,586 --> 00:50:24,588
Kolya.

685
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:29,592
Damian.

686
00:50:29,593 --> 00:50:32,095
Get the guns out.

687
00:50:32,096 --> 00:50:34,098
Save the guns.

688
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,101
Get them out.

689
00:50:46,610 --> 00:50:48,612
Get these boxes out!

690
00:50:54,618 --> 00:50:56,619
Did you do it?

691
00:50:56,620 --> 00:50:58,121
Yes, Father.

692
00:50:58,122 --> 00:50:59,624
They're safe.

693
00:51:01,125 --> 00:51:03,626
For our men.

694
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:06,130
Take it to them.

695
00:51:07,131 --> 00:51:12,135
They're... They're at
the end of the stream.

696
00:51:12,136 --> 00:51:14,137
Other side,

697
00:51:14,138 --> 00:51:16,639
Obmyk Hill...

698
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:21,145
Beyond the pinewoods, past...

699
00:51:22,646 --> 00:51:25,149
Take it back to them.

700
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:26,649
You hear me?

701
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,152
Yes, Father. We'll
take it back.

702
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:34,659
Say hello to... To
your mother for me.

703
00:52:02,186 --> 00:52:05,189
I promise.

704
00:52:34,718 --> 00:52:37,220
Well, that's all of it.

705
00:52:37,221 --> 00:52:39,722
I'll say goodbye now.

706
00:52:39,723 --> 00:52:41,724
Travel at night and
stick to the woods.

707
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:43,726
When you get to the
upper crossroads,

708
00:52:43,727 --> 00:52:45,728
you'll see a little --
but what about you?

709
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:47,230
You said the Germans
had crossed the river.

710
00:52:47,231 --> 00:52:49,232
How can you get
to the airfield?

711
00:52:49,233 --> 00:52:52,235
I'll get through all right.

712
00:52:52,236 --> 00:52:54,737
Now, do your best.

713
00:52:54,738 --> 00:52:56,739
Don't be frightened.

714
00:52:56,740 --> 00:53:00,744
Fear is a bad enemy -- or
so people have told me.

715
00:53:01,245 --> 00:53:02,745
Bye, Clavdia.

716
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:04,748
Goodbye, Kolya.

717
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:07,752
Marina.

718
00:53:11,255 --> 00:53:14,257
We'll do the best we can.
That's all.

719
00:53:14,258 --> 00:53:16,260
Tell Mother that...

720
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,269
Grisha.

721
00:53:26,270 --> 00:53:28,272
Goodbye, Kolya.

722
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:32,276
Look after them, Karp.

723
00:53:55,799 --> 00:53:59,303
Twenty-five years ago, we
fought and died for this earth.

724
00:54:01,805 --> 00:54:03,306
People go forward.

725
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:04,809
They fight for themselves

726
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:06,809
and make things better
for themselves --

727
00:54:06,810 --> 00:54:12,315
more food, a good bed, jokes
to make and time to laugh.

728
00:54:12,316 --> 00:54:14,819
Then the filthy come
and try to stop it.

729
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:16,319
They want to take
away from people

730
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:18,823
all the good they've made
for themselves.

731
00:54:20,824 --> 00:54:24,327
Well... Then you take your gun

732
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:27,832
and you fight until
you've killed all such.

733
00:54:30,834 --> 00:54:32,335
Ready, comrades?

734
00:54:32,336 --> 00:54:33,836
Yes, comrade.

735
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:35,339
We're ready.

736
00:54:54,358 --> 00:54:57,360
We are ordered to occupy
the North Star village.

737
00:54:57,361 --> 00:54:59,362
How big is this village?

738
00:54:59,363 --> 00:55:00,865
Not big.

739
00:55:01,365 --> 00:55:03,868
We're only taking
125 men to hold it.

740
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:07,370
We are ordered to establish
a regimental field hospital

741
00:55:07,371 --> 00:55:09,872
in the village
North Star ahead.

742
00:55:09,873 --> 00:55:12,875
Field hospital and a
village dispensary.

743
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:15,378
How can I take care of all
these men and more to come?

744
00:55:15,379 --> 00:55:16,881
The order says that
more ambulances

745
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:18,381
and doctors will
be sent to us.

746
00:55:18,382 --> 00:55:19,882
I don't want doctors.

747
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:21,384
I need surgeons.

748
00:55:21,385 --> 00:55:24,889
The colonel has forgotten me.
I am a surgeon.

749
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:30,893
A surgeon is a man who can
operate, Dr. Richter.

750
00:55:30,894 --> 00:55:32,896
I have not forgotten you.

751
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:44,407
Dr. Richter, where did you
take your medical training?

752
00:55:44,408 --> 00:55:47,411
Freiburg, as I have told the
colonel many times before.

753
00:55:48,912 --> 00:55:50,914
That was a good school.

754
00:55:51,415 --> 00:55:52,655
I must beg the
colonel's pardon.

755
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:54,917
With respect to the colonel's superior
rank and reputation,

756
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,419
I must beg the
colonel's pardon to --

757
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,422
do not beg my pardon
so often, Dr. Richter.

758
00:55:59,423 --> 00:56:02,425
Good manners do not
make a good surgeon.

759
00:56:02,426 --> 00:56:03,928
It's well known, of course,

760
00:56:03,929 --> 00:56:06,929
the colonel studied at the
University of Leipzig.

761
00:56:06,930 --> 00:56:08,931
In the great days.

762
00:56:08,932 --> 00:56:11,935
I was a pupil of freidenthal.

763
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:13,936
His most famous pupil.

764
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:16,439
Freidenthal? The Jew?

765
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:18,941
Yes. Freidenthal the Jew.

766
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,943
The colonel did not
mind his being a Jew?

767
00:56:20,944 --> 00:56:22,445
Mind?

768
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:25,948
I never thought about
it in those days.

769
00:56:25,949 --> 00:56:27,951
It must be pleasant to
be so sure of oneself.

770
00:56:28,452 --> 00:56:29,954
I should like to
think I was as good

771
00:56:30,454 --> 00:56:31,956
as the colonel thinks he is.

772
00:56:33,457 --> 00:56:36,459
The day you think you're as
good as I am, Dr. Richter,

773
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:38,461
I will know that
you're suffering

774
00:56:38,462 --> 00:56:39,964
from delusions of grandeur

775
00:56:39,965 --> 00:56:42,465
and I shall commit
you to an asylum.

776
00:56:42,466 --> 00:56:44,969
Trust me, Dr. Richter.

777
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:55,971
Burn your houses! The
Germans are coming!

778
00:57:01,985 --> 00:57:04,988
Burn your houses! The
Germans are coming!

779
00:57:10,494 --> 00:57:12,495
It's hard. The hardest part.

780
00:57:12,496 --> 00:57:14,497
The hardest part.

781
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:16,000
Go and do it now.

782
00:58:21,535 --> 00:58:25,039
Others give their lives. We
give what is life to us.

783
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:57,600
Look.

784
00:58:57,601 --> 00:58:59,103
Another burning village.

785
00:58:59,104 --> 00:59:02,105
Speed up. Speed up.

786
00:59:09,613 --> 00:59:12,116
Quite different, isn't
it, Dr. Richter?

787
00:59:12,616 --> 00:59:15,618
The Army of the Third Reich
didn't see burning villages

788
00:59:15,619 --> 00:59:17,620
on its pleasant tour
through Western Europe.

789
00:59:17,621 --> 00:59:19,123
This amuses the colonel?

790
00:59:19,124 --> 00:59:21,624
No. Danger doesn't amuse me.

791
00:59:21,625 --> 00:59:24,627
I only state facts.

792
00:59:24,628 --> 00:59:27,630
A strong people. One
has always heard that.

793
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:31,135
A hard people to conquer.

794
01:01:06,229 --> 01:01:09,232
Silence!

795
01:01:11,234 --> 01:01:13,737
Who is responsible for the
burning and destruction

796
01:01:14,237 --> 01:01:15,238
in this village?

797
01:01:22,746 --> 01:01:25,249
Where are the younger men?

798
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:32,755
They burned it and
have tried to escape.

799
01:01:32,756 --> 01:01:34,258
Is that correct?

800
01:01:48,271 --> 01:01:50,273
Has the hospital
been burned down?

801
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:53,275
It is not bad. We caught it.

802
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:54,778
Carry in the
casualties immediately

803
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:56,779
and get the operative
cases ready.

804
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:58,282
As you order, colonel.

805
01:02:06,289 --> 01:02:08,791
The chairman of the Soviet
of this collective farm

806
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:11,795
is called... Rodion Pavlov.

807
01:02:12,796 --> 01:02:14,798
Is he here?

808
01:02:17,300 --> 01:02:19,302
Where is his family?

809
01:02:22,806 --> 01:02:24,807
I wish these
questions answered!

810
01:02:24,808 --> 01:02:27,311
You have already, by the
burning of this village,

811
01:02:27,312 --> 01:02:30,814
shown yourselves to be
enemies of the German army.

812
01:02:31,815 --> 01:02:35,819
We punish our enemies...
Severely.

813
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,823
Where is the wife
of Rodion Pavlov?

814
01:02:46,329 --> 01:02:48,831
I am the wife of
Rodion Pavlov.

815
01:02:48,832 --> 01:02:49,833
Come forward.

816
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:58,842
I wish to know where
your husband is hiding,

817
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:03,346
how many men he has with him
and how much ammunition.

818
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,848
Yes?

819
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:08,350
I cannot answer
those questions.

820
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:11,354
You are certain that
you will not answer?

821
01:03:12,355 --> 01:03:14,357
I am certain.

822
01:03:15,358 --> 01:03:16,860
Take her inside.

823
01:04:03,907 --> 01:04:07,911
Swine. Swine!

824
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:11,914
I am a doctor.

825
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:14,416
They will bring her out.

826
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:17,419
Her right arm and her
right leg will be broken.

827
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:19,421
You should advise your
people to give information

828
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:20,423
when it is asked for.

829
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:21,924
You are a doctor and
you are able to --

830
01:04:21,925 --> 01:04:24,927
in this new order of ours,
we have to countenance

831
01:04:24,928 --> 01:04:27,931
and commit many acts one does
not necessarily approve of.

832
01:05:06,469 --> 01:05:07,469
Shh.

833
01:05:41,004 --> 01:05:43,005
We'll have a look.

834
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:45,008
We'll join you at
the crossroads.

835
01:06:09,032 --> 01:06:10,534
Wait.

836
01:06:12,535 --> 01:06:14,036
Take Clavdia and grisha
and hitch the horses.

837
01:06:14,037 --> 01:06:16,038
I can shoot. Do
what I tell you.

838
01:06:16,039 --> 01:06:18,542
If anything goes wrong,
then -- well, drive away.

839
01:06:19,042 --> 01:06:21,044
Don't wait. Just drive.

840
01:06:24,047 --> 01:06:27,551
The horses. Quick.
Hitch the horses.

841
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,557
Frightened?

842
01:06:35,558 --> 01:06:37,559
I...

843
01:06:37,560 --> 01:06:39,561
Yes.

844
01:06:39,562 --> 01:06:41,563
Good.

845
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:43,565
Only fools aren't frightened

846
01:06:43,566 --> 01:06:46,069
when there's something
to be frightened about.

847
01:06:46,569 --> 01:06:49,572
And I don't like to see
a fool hold a gun.

848
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:53,075
Now, go on.

849
01:06:53,076 --> 01:06:55,077
And remember --

850
01:06:55,078 --> 01:06:57,079
you'll only have
a second to fire

851
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:59,583
and you must be
quick and sure.

852
01:09:34,237 --> 01:09:36,238
Try to sleep.

853
01:09:36,239 --> 01:09:38,742
I'll watch.

854
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:45,747
Planes?

855
01:09:45,748 --> 01:09:47,749
It's hard to tell.

856
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,752
You get some sleep, my dear.

857
01:09:50,753 --> 01:09:54,256
Everything sounds
like planes to me.

858
01:09:54,257 --> 01:09:58,260
I think of Damian
and the children...

859
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:00,263
Wherever they are.

860
01:10:02,265 --> 01:10:03,767
And Kolya.

861
01:10:09,772 --> 01:10:11,774
You are quiet for you.

862
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:15,278
I haven't had any
sleep for 30 hours.

863
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:18,280
I've been on four
bombing trips today.

864
01:10:18,281 --> 01:10:19,781
You're my fifth.

865
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:21,283
How did you do?

866
01:10:21,284 --> 01:10:24,286
Well, I always do well.

867
01:10:24,287 --> 01:10:28,290
I got two planes...
Whole line of supplies.

868
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:30,292
Got some big guns
near the river.

869
01:10:30,293 --> 01:10:31,795
Well, get ready
to do it again.

870
01:10:32,295 --> 01:10:33,797
We'll be over them
in three minutes.

871
01:10:33,798 --> 01:10:35,797
We'll see how good you are.

872
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,299
Oh, I'm good.

873
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:40,302
You must have heard about me.

874
01:10:40,303 --> 01:10:41,803
First flight, son?

875
01:10:41,804 --> 01:10:44,806
This is my first flight
in the war, Grandaddy.

876
01:10:44,807 --> 01:10:46,309
I was at home on leave.

877
01:10:47,810 --> 01:10:49,811
Well, don't get
shaky about it.

878
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:51,814
I'll bring you
through all right.

879
01:10:59,322 --> 01:11:00,822
He talks that way.

880
01:11:00,823 --> 01:11:02,324
I've been flying
with him for years.

881
01:11:02,325 --> 01:11:04,828
I'm used to it.

882
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:19,842
I can blow those supply trucks.
What do you say?

883
01:11:20,343 --> 01:11:21,343
Save your bombs.

884
01:11:21,344 --> 01:11:22,846
This will make a
good strafing job.

885
01:11:22,847 --> 01:11:25,348
We're going down.

886
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:37,360
Tanks. Tanks in
those trees ahead.

887
01:11:42,865 --> 01:11:45,367
Pilot, are you all right?

888
01:11:45,368 --> 01:11:46,870
Are you all right?!

889
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:51,874
Gunner, they got the pilot.
Come forward at once.

890
01:12:36,419 --> 01:12:37,919
Sir.

891
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:39,921
Where did you get it?
Are you bad?

892
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:41,423
I don't know.

893
01:12:41,424 --> 01:12:42,924
I can't feel it.

894
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:46,428
Remember -- years
ago in training?

895
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:48,932
They said when you couldn't
feel it, it was bad!

896
01:12:49,432 --> 01:12:51,433
That's not true. That's all
talk. You hold on.

897
01:12:51,434 --> 01:12:53,435
We'll go over the road and
let go what we got left,

898
01:12:53,436 --> 01:12:55,076
and I'll have on the
ground in 10 minutes.

899
01:13:01,944 --> 01:13:04,446
We're badly clipped in the back.
It's worse than I thought.

900
01:13:04,447 --> 01:13:05,447
You crawl to the back.

901
01:13:05,448 --> 01:13:06,948
I'll let you know
when to bail out.

902
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:08,450
No, never. Never been
frightened, I mean.

903
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:10,452
Maybe there's something
the matter with me.

904
01:13:10,453 --> 01:13:11,955
All right. Crawl back now.

905
01:13:11,956 --> 01:13:13,955
If you can't open the
hatch, I'll do it for you.

906
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,356
If the plane's too bad to land,
I'm gonna try something else.

907
01:13:16,459 --> 01:13:18,300
And it doesn't need more
than one man to do it.

908
01:13:18,461 --> 01:13:20,461
Now, don't argue and sound
brave and be a nuisance.

909
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:21,463
I can do it alone.

910
01:13:21,464 --> 01:13:22,966
Get ready to jump!

911
01:13:27,470 --> 01:13:29,973
Well, you'd never
have made it anyway.

912
01:13:37,980 --> 01:13:39,981
I'll get ready for it.

913
01:13:39,982 --> 01:13:43,485
This is going to be for
my father and for me

914
01:13:43,486 --> 01:13:46,990
and for my village and for
people I've never seen.

915
01:13:47,990 --> 01:13:50,492
Those are big words.

916
01:13:50,493 --> 01:13:52,996
I guess I'll have to
stand by them now.

917
01:13:54,997 --> 01:13:57,499
I'm coming down, and
it's going to hurt you!

918
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,501
And I'm coming down
just where I want to

919
01:13:59,502 --> 01:14:02,505
because I was a good bombardier
and a good pilot, too!

920
01:14:44,046 --> 01:14:47,049
The children were given their
supper at the hospital tonight.

921
01:14:47,550 --> 01:14:48,551
Good. They needed it.

922
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:50,552
Why did they do that?

923
01:14:50,553 --> 01:14:52,554
There's been
nothing but bad bread.

924
01:14:52,555 --> 01:14:54,055
What? What, Anna?

925
01:14:54,056 --> 01:14:57,058
The children are still
at the hospital --

926
01:14:57,059 --> 01:15:00,061
in the hall, on the
benches where I saw them.

927
01:15:00,062 --> 01:15:02,564
Supper was over long ago.
Shh. Shh.

928
01:15:02,565 --> 01:15:04,067
What?

929
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,091
Sasha.

930
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:31,594
Shh.

931
01:15:34,597 --> 01:15:37,599
He says we are to stay here.

932
01:15:37,600 --> 01:15:39,100
He says we --

933
01:15:39,101 --> 01:15:41,604
Mischa and Sonya
went in there and...

934
01:15:55,618 --> 01:15:57,620
Forceps.

935
01:15:59,121 --> 01:16:00,122
Gauze.

936
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:15,638
No. Don't do that.

937
01:16:18,641 --> 01:16:20,143
No. Don't do that.

938
01:16:41,163 --> 01:16:42,164
Rag.

939
01:16:48,671 --> 01:16:50,672
Orderly!

940
01:16:50,673 --> 01:16:53,174
Guard! Guard!

941
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:55,176
Guard!

942
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:57,679
Take this man out. Put
him under arrest.

943
01:16:57,680 --> 01:17:01,683
Do not be so nervous,
Captain Richter.

944
01:17:01,684 --> 01:17:04,185
You are well guarded
in this room

945
01:17:04,186 --> 01:17:06,688
from the feeble attacks
of an old man.

946
01:17:06,689 --> 01:17:08,191
Dismissed!

947
01:17:10,192 --> 01:17:12,695
After you, Dr. Kurin.

948
01:17:13,696 --> 01:17:17,699
I realize that this is difficult
for you to understand.

949
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:20,703
But our plasma supply
was insufficient,

950
01:17:21,203 --> 01:17:24,205
so we have to take blood for our
wounded where we can get it

951
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:26,709
and where the donor is
easiest to control.

952
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:31,212
I was looking at your
hospital library today.

953
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:35,217
I had forgotten that Kurin
the pathologist was Russian.

954
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:39,722
Strange to find you in
this little village.

955
01:17:41,223 --> 01:17:44,726
You came to the University of
Leipzig to read your paper.

956
01:17:44,727 --> 01:17:48,229
Must have been...
30 years ago.

957
01:17:48,230 --> 01:17:51,733
I was a student, of course,
and not allowed to hear you.

958
01:17:51,734 --> 01:17:53,735
But I remember it.

959
01:17:53,736 --> 01:17:55,737
Cigarette?

960
01:17:55,738 --> 01:17:57,240
They said that men of medicine

961
01:17:57,740 --> 01:17:59,741
see all that can
happen to people.

962
01:17:59,742 --> 01:18:02,245
I'm an old man, and
I have seen much.

963
01:18:02,745 --> 01:18:04,247
But how can a doctor
bring himself

964
01:18:04,248 --> 01:18:06,247
to not only take
blood from children

965
01:18:06,248 --> 01:18:07,749
but to bleed them white?

966
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:11,254
Comrade Kurin.

967
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:24,767
This boy needs help.

968
01:18:25,267 --> 01:18:27,269
May I? Of course.

969
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:38,279
Dr. Von Harden,

970
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:40,281
do you mean that you're not
having this man arrested?

971
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:43,284
If you wish to be a
warrior, Captain Richter,

972
01:18:43,285 --> 01:18:45,286
you must take chances
with your life.

973
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:47,288
Dr. Kurin is a famous
man of science.

974
01:18:47,289 --> 01:18:51,293
He's not a man who kills and
therefore no danger to us.

975
01:19:07,309 --> 01:19:10,311
Halt! Who goes there?

976
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:11,813
It's me -- Dr. Kurin.

977
01:19:11,814 --> 01:19:14,817
Advance to be recognized!

978
01:19:21,824 --> 01:19:23,324
The Kechins' boy.

979
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:25,326
You recognize him, comrade.
Take me to Rodion.

980
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:26,328
Yeah.

981
01:19:53,355 --> 01:19:56,357
Twenty trucks. Now
start counting.

982
01:19:56,358 --> 01:19:59,861
One, two, three, four, five,

983
01:19:59,862 --> 01:20:02,363
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

984
01:20:02,364 --> 01:20:04,366
Ten seconds. And
here they come.

985
01:20:28,891 --> 01:20:30,892
Twenty trucks,
then 10 seconds.

986
01:20:30,893 --> 01:20:32,395
Eight motorcycles
in 15 seconds.

987
01:20:32,895 --> 01:20:35,398
And more trucks without ammo.

988
01:20:47,409 --> 01:20:49,410
Yes. That's the track.

989
01:20:49,411 --> 01:20:52,413
Karp hasn't seen these
hills for 10 years,

990
01:20:52,414 --> 01:20:54,916
but he remembered
them as if --

991
01:20:54,917 --> 01:20:56,918
we'll go straight through
without stopping,

992
01:20:56,919 --> 01:20:58,419
and we'll be there.

993
01:20:58,420 --> 01:21:00,421
We'll have done our work.

994
01:21:00,422 --> 01:21:02,924
Yes.

995
01:21:02,925 --> 01:21:04,927
Your face has changed.

996
01:21:05,928 --> 01:21:08,930
And yours.

997
01:21:08,931 --> 01:21:11,934
Tired and hungry.

998
01:21:12,935 --> 01:21:14,936
You read about hunger,

999
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:18,441
but you don't understand how bad
it is until it happens to you.

1000
01:21:18,442 --> 01:21:21,442
If Karp and I can keep awake,
nothing else will matter.

1001
01:21:21,443 --> 01:21:22,944
I can do some of the driving.

1002
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:24,445
Not this time.

1003
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:26,948
We'll be climbing.
It'll be hard.

1004
01:21:26,949 --> 01:21:28,950
You'll sleep on my shoulder.

1005
01:21:28,951 --> 01:21:32,455
That'll make me feel
good, sure of myself.

1006
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:39,961
Could I, Marina?

1007
01:21:39,962 --> 01:21:41,964
I've never...

1008
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:44,967
Could I?

1009
01:22:13,495 --> 01:22:15,496
I'm going through the
woods to this side.

1010
01:22:15,497 --> 01:22:19,000
As their group of motorcycles
come around this turn,

1011
01:22:19,001 --> 01:22:21,002
I'm going to fire at them.

1012
01:22:21,003 --> 01:22:22,505
That'll stop the column.

1013
01:22:22,506 --> 01:22:24,005
You will be ready here.

1014
01:22:24,006 --> 01:22:27,510
As the firing starts, you will
take the wagons across the road.

1015
01:22:27,511 --> 01:22:29,010
The firing will
cover the noise,

1016
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:32,013
and they'll not be
watching for you.

1017
01:22:32,014 --> 01:22:34,517
They'll be busy with me.

1018
01:22:35,017 --> 01:22:36,018
I hope.

1019
01:22:45,027 --> 01:22:47,028
If two people were
there to fire,

1020
01:22:47,029 --> 01:22:48,531
one one side and one another,

1021
01:22:48,532 --> 01:22:50,531
it'll be a better
chance for you.

1022
01:22:50,532 --> 01:22:52,033
I'm coming with you.

1023
01:22:52,034 --> 01:22:54,537
It's not for us to talk of
what's best for one of us.

1024
01:22:54,538 --> 01:22:56,537
You're needed to
take home the guns.

1025
01:22:56,538 --> 01:22:58,539
That's what you must do
and what you will do.

1026
01:22:58,540 --> 01:23:01,042
When you hear the
firing, go across.

1027
01:23:01,043 --> 01:23:05,047
When it's over, I'll meet you
on the hill by the cow path.

1028
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:09,552
On the hill by the cow path.

1029
01:23:18,060 --> 01:23:20,563
He's right, Marina.
It's the only way.

1030
01:24:02,104 --> 01:24:03,604
Soon now.

1031
01:24:03,605 --> 01:24:06,607
When you hear the firing, go
across as fast as you can.

1032
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:10,112
And remember to leave room
for me to cross next to you.

1033
01:24:15,117 --> 01:24:17,620
Grisha.

1034
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:19,120
Where's Clavdia?

1035
01:24:19,121 --> 01:24:20,621
She's gone.

1036
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:23,124
She went after Damian.

1037
01:24:23,125 --> 01:24:25,126
I saw her.

1038
01:24:25,127 --> 01:24:27,628
Grisha.

1039
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:29,630
Why didn't you -- I
must go find her.

1040
01:24:29,631 --> 01:24:32,633
You must not go after her.
You must let her alone.

1041
01:24:32,634 --> 01:24:34,136
I saw her face.

1042
01:25:22,184 --> 01:25:24,185
Oh, Grandpa.

1043
01:25:24,186 --> 01:25:25,186
Anna.

1044
01:25:25,187 --> 01:25:28,190
Oh, somebody help me.

1045
01:25:28,690 --> 01:25:33,195
Make me do something right,
the way everybody else does.

1046
01:25:34,696 --> 01:25:37,199
Keep me from being
so frightened.

1047
01:25:38,200 --> 01:25:42,705
Keep me from crying, please.

1048
01:28:10,352 --> 01:28:12,353
Where are you hit?

1049
01:28:12,354 --> 01:28:14,356
Bad?

1050
01:28:20,862 --> 01:28:22,864
There are only two --

1051
01:28:33,375 --> 01:28:36,378
don't go, Marina. Wait
a few more minutes.

1052
01:28:45,887 --> 01:28:48,889
A dead kid and a fat girl.

1053
01:28:48,890 --> 01:28:52,393
All right. Signal
to them to go on.

1054
01:28:52,394 --> 01:28:54,897
The dangerous enemy
has been dealt with.

1055
01:28:54,898 --> 01:28:56,398
I'm going.

1056
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:59,401
Stay here.

1057
01:29:26,928 --> 01:29:28,930
Blind.

1058
01:29:37,939 --> 01:29:41,943
Clavdia?

1059
01:30:27,989 --> 01:30:30,992
Come on. We just have time.

1060
01:30:44,005 --> 01:30:45,506
Is it bad?

1061
01:30:45,507 --> 01:30:47,508
No wounds on him.

1062
01:30:47,509 --> 01:30:49,009
Clavdia.

1063
01:30:49,010 --> 01:30:50,010
It's me -- Marina.

1064
01:30:50,011 --> 01:30:51,512
And Karp.

1065
01:30:51,513 --> 01:30:52,513
Clavdia.

1066
01:30:52,514 --> 01:30:55,516
Cla-- where is she?

1067
01:30:55,517 --> 01:30:59,520
Clavdia.

1068
01:30:59,521 --> 01:31:01,522
She's dead.

1069
01:31:01,523 --> 01:31:03,025
Clavdia.

1070
01:31:38,059 --> 01:31:39,060
Marina?

1071
01:31:39,561 --> 01:31:41,061
Yes?

1072
01:31:41,062 --> 01:31:42,062
Where are we?

1073
01:31:42,063 --> 01:31:44,565
Over the Yunageno Hills.

1074
01:31:44,566 --> 01:31:46,066
How much longer?

1075
01:31:46,067 --> 01:31:49,069
Not much more.

1076
01:31:49,070 --> 01:31:52,072
What time is it?

1077
01:31:52,073 --> 01:31:54,575
About 5:00.

1078
01:31:54,576 --> 01:31:57,079
5:00.

1079
01:31:58,079 --> 01:32:01,583
In the morning or --
or in the afternoon?

1080
01:32:35,617 --> 01:32:37,619
All right! All right!

1081
01:32:38,119 --> 01:32:40,120
You say Boris has not
come with the guns,

1082
01:32:40,121 --> 01:32:42,623
but they are your children, and
they're being bled to death!

1083
01:32:42,624 --> 01:32:45,125
Why, the whole
village will be --

1084
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:47,629
our time has come to fight.

1085
01:32:48,129 --> 01:32:49,631
It does no good for me to lie.

1086
01:32:50,131 --> 01:32:54,135
Men with rocks and clubs are
not good against machine guns.

1087
01:32:54,636 --> 01:32:57,139
Now, there will be
five men to a gun.

1088
01:32:57,140 --> 01:32:59,139
You know it, and I'll say it.

1089
01:32:59,140 --> 01:33:01,642
This may be the last time
we ride down a hill.

1090
01:33:01,643 --> 01:33:02,644
What do you say?

1091
01:33:04,646 --> 01:33:07,149
All right. Saddle your horses.

1092
01:33:09,651 --> 01:33:11,652
Take up your watch
at the pine grove.

1093
01:33:11,653 --> 01:33:13,654
And when Boris gets
here with the guns,

1094
01:33:13,655 --> 01:33:15,157
rush him down to the
north cornfield.

1095
01:33:15,158 --> 01:33:17,659
Pray that he arrives in time.

1096
01:34:03,204 --> 01:34:05,707
All right. The selected
men, dismount.

1097
01:34:08,710 --> 01:34:12,713
The rest of you wait here
until you see the gas aflame,

1098
01:34:12,714 --> 01:34:15,217
and then ride to the
schoolyard and ride fast.

1099
01:34:15,218 --> 01:34:18,219
Barricade it soon as you get in.

1100
01:34:32,233 --> 01:34:33,734
You know the plan.

1101
01:34:33,735 --> 01:34:36,236
Each group knows what to do.

1102
01:34:36,237 --> 01:34:37,238
Now let's do it.

1103
01:36:29,851 --> 01:36:31,852
All right. Now for
the gasoline.

1104
01:36:31,853 --> 01:36:34,356
Let's keep it pouring.

1105
01:38:05,446 --> 01:38:07,447
Down! We are fighting
in the village!

1106
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:08,449
I'll take you!

1107
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:31,473
They're our men!
They've come to fight.

1108
01:39:06,007 --> 01:39:09,010
Sophia, Nadya, our
children are home!

1109
01:39:10,011 --> 01:39:11,511
The children!

1110
01:39:11,512 --> 01:39:12,513
Nadya!

1111
01:39:25,526 --> 01:39:26,526
Grisha.

1112
01:39:26,527 --> 01:39:27,527
Anna!

1113
01:39:27,528 --> 01:39:29,530
My baby is home!

1114
01:39:35,036 --> 01:39:36,538
Damian, it's your mother.

1115
01:39:36,539 --> 01:39:38,539
Damian!

1116
01:39:49,550 --> 01:39:52,053
Mama.

1117
01:39:57,058 --> 01:39:59,060
Mama.

1118
01:40:06,567 --> 01:40:09,569
Grandpa!

1119
01:40:09,570 --> 01:40:10,571
Gran--

1120
01:41:43,164 --> 01:41:45,667
I have come for another
visit, Dr. Von Harden.

1121
01:41:45,668 --> 01:41:47,668
I'll only be a minute, doctor.

1122
01:41:50,171 --> 01:41:52,173
Sulfanilamide.

1123
01:41:59,180 --> 01:42:01,182
Come in, Dr. Kurin.

1124
01:42:04,685 --> 01:42:08,188
You do not like Dr. Richter.

1125
01:42:08,189 --> 01:42:11,693
I do not like
incompetent doctors.

1126
01:42:12,693 --> 01:42:15,195
I do not like much
of what I have done

1127
01:42:15,196 --> 01:42:16,197
for the past nine years.

1128
01:42:16,697 --> 01:42:19,699
You do not like bleeding
children to their death?

1129
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:20,700
The boy died?

1130
01:42:20,701 --> 01:42:23,203
You knew he would die!

1131
01:42:23,204 --> 01:42:25,707
They took too much blood.

1132
01:42:26,207 --> 01:42:28,208
I am sorry for that.

1133
01:42:28,209 --> 01:42:32,712
Yes, I believe you when
you tell me you're sorry.

1134
01:42:32,713 --> 01:42:36,717
I'm sorry for many
things, Dr. Kurin.

1135
01:42:37,718 --> 01:42:40,220
Most sorry that it isn't
the world we used to know.

1136
01:42:40,221 --> 01:42:43,223
I have heard about
men like you --

1137
01:42:43,224 --> 01:42:46,726
civilized men who are sorry.

1138
01:42:46,727 --> 01:42:48,728
This?

1139
01:42:48,729 --> 01:42:50,730
This kind is nothing.

1140
01:42:50,731 --> 01:42:54,734
They will go when
their bosses go.

1141
01:42:54,735 --> 01:42:59,739
But men like you, who have
contempt for men like him --

1142
01:42:59,740 --> 01:43:03,243
to me, you are the real filth.

1143
01:43:03,244 --> 01:43:07,747
Men who do the work of fascists
while they pretend to themselves

1144
01:43:07,748 --> 01:43:11,751
that they are better than the
beasts for whom they work.

1145
01:43:11,752 --> 01:43:13,253
Men who do murder

1146
01:43:13,254 --> 01:43:17,258
while they laugh at those
who order them to do it.

1147
01:43:17,758 --> 01:43:21,262
It is men like you who have sold
their people to men like him.

1148
01:43:23,264 --> 01:43:25,265
You see, Dr. Von Harden,

1149
01:43:25,266 --> 01:43:28,269
you were wrong
about many things.

1150
01:43:28,769 --> 01:43:31,272
I am a man who kills.

1151
01:43:49,790 --> 01:43:52,792
You, uh, feel you'll
need this thing, huh?

1152
01:43:52,793 --> 01:43:55,295
I like it.

1153
01:43:55,296 --> 01:43:58,298
We will come home someday.

1154
01:43:58,299 --> 01:44:00,800
I want to sew again.

1155
01:44:00,801 --> 01:44:04,304
And you will want to
write your book again.

1156
01:44:04,305 --> 01:44:06,307
We are not so old.

1157
01:44:12,313 --> 01:44:14,816
They tell me you were
very brave, Grandpa.

1158
01:44:14,817 --> 01:44:15,816
And why not, child?

1159
01:44:15,817 --> 01:44:18,319
I'm of the same blood
as you and Clavdia.

1160
01:44:22,323 --> 01:44:23,823
It's gone.

1161
01:44:23,824 --> 01:44:26,326
There will be another someday.

1162
01:44:26,327 --> 01:44:27,327
Yes.

1163
01:44:27,328 --> 01:44:29,330
It will be different for us.

1164
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:32,332
Wars don't leave
people as they were.

1165
01:44:32,333 --> 01:44:34,334
All people will learn this

1166
01:44:34,335 --> 01:44:38,338
and come to see that
wars do not have to be.

1167
01:44:38,339 --> 01:44:41,843
We'll make this the last war.

1168
01:44:42,843 --> 01:44:46,347
We'll make a free
world for all men.

1169
01:44:47,848 --> 01:44:52,853
The Earth belongs to us, the
people, if we fight for it.

1170
01:44:53,854 --> 01:44:55,856
And we will fight for it!

1171
01:45:01,862 --> 01:45:04,364
♪ Our forest, our river ♪

1172
01:45:04,365 --> 01:45:06,866

land and home ♪
