1
00:01:09,102 --> 00:01:10,865
<i>So... I know what you're thinking.</i>

2
00:01:11,024 --> 00:01:13,203
<i>Why is that incredibly handsome hedgehog</i>

3
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,567
<i>being chased by a mad man
with a mustache from the civil war?</i>

4
00:01:17,055 --> 00:01:20,559
<i>Gotta be honest, it feels like
I've been running my whole life.</i>

5
00:01:20,856 --> 00:01:23,232
<i>Is this too much? Am I going too fast?</i>

6
00:01:23,398 --> 00:01:26,431
<i>It's kinda what I do.
You know what? Let's back up.</i>

7
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,880
<i>This is the island where I am from.</i>

8
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:41,535
<i>It had everything: sandy beaches,
cascading waterfalls,</i>

9
00:01:41,758 --> 00:01:43,647
<i>public access to loop-de-loops.</i>

10
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,636
<i>And I never had to catch a school bus</i>

11
00:01:45,790 --> 00:01:49,650
<i>because I can run across the entire island
in less than two seconds.</i>

12
00:01:49,834 --> 00:01:51,613
<i>Also, there was no school.</i>

13
00:01:51,777 --> 00:01:54,242
<i>I know, pretty sweet island, right?</i>

14
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,591
<i>I was born with extraordinary powers,
and was told to keep them in secret.</i>

15
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:02,840
<i>And like any kid, I did the exact opposite.</i>

16
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:07,572
<i>That's Longclaw, she took care of me.</i>

17
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:11,970
<i>She was basically Obi-Wan Kenobi,
if Obi-Wan Kenobi had a beak and ate mice.</i>

18
00:02:12,475 --> 00:02:14,660
Sonic, someone could've seen you!

19
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,635
No one saw me. I am too fast!

20
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:20,178
And, I wanted to bring you this.

21
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:25,115
Get down!

22
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:32,199
<i>Turns out with great power
comes great power-hungry bad guys.</i>

23
00:02:32,409 --> 00:02:34,713
<i>And I let them right to us.</i>

24
00:02:48,937 --> 00:02:50,891
Listen carefully, Sonic.

25
00:02:51,473 --> 00:02:54,465
You have a power unlike anything
I've ever seen.

26
00:02:54,602 --> 00:02:57,152
And that means someone
will always want it.

27
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:01,354
The only way to stay safe
is to stay hidden.

28
00:03:04,258 --> 00:03:08,349
This word is on the farthest side
of the universe. You should be safe there.

29
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:11,166
- I don't wanna go without you!
- You must!

30
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:14,382
These rings will be your most important
possession.

31
00:03:17,943 --> 00:03:20,440
If you ever discovered, use one.

32
00:03:20,828 --> 00:03:24,486
Never stop running. Now go!

33
00:03:28,717 --> 00:03:30,685
Longclaw!

34
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,830
- Goodbye, Sonic.
- No!

35
00:03:35,498 --> 00:03:37,216
No!

36
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:05,254
C'mon, one car?

37
00:04:15,469 --> 00:04:16,628
I'm bored.

38
00:04:16,664 --> 00:04:18,439
Tom, do you read me?
Are you there?

39
00:04:18,689 --> 00:04:22,110
No, Wade, I'm actually on a yacht
in Barbados

40
00:04:22,764 --> 00:04:24,189
with Rihanna.

41
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:27,401
OMG. That's amazing, please send pics.

42
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:29,535
No, Wade, I'm at the speed trap.

43
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:33,194
Already? How did you get back so fast?
Barbados is in the ocean.

44
00:04:33,338 --> 00:04:35,483
Hang on, I think I got something.

45
00:04:41,854 --> 00:04:44,602
Hey, buddy, where's the fire?

46
00:04:44,934 --> 00:04:47,094
We've got kids living around here.

47
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:50,502
It was kinda funny, sorry.

48
00:04:56,389 --> 00:04:58,003
What?

49
00:05:36,996 --> 00:05:41,042
<i>Tom, we need you down on Main Street.
There's been a violent gang shoot-out.</i>

50
00:05:42,828 --> 00:05:47,316
<i>Just kidding, a duck stole a bagel.
But they do need it back.</i>

51
00:05:58,859 --> 00:06:01,300
Buddy, you almost got yourself killed
out there.

52
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,431
What are you, some kind
of an adrenaline junkie?

53
00:06:03,554 --> 00:06:05,653
Must be rough being slow all the time.

54
00:06:05,703 --> 00:06:09,330
I'll tell you what,
today is your lucky day.

55
00:06:13,367 --> 00:06:15,836
Have you ever felt so alive?

56
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:19,402
This is great, you're doing amazing.

57
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,260
Oh, jeez!

58
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:24,096
Good recovery!

59
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:28,799
Let's keep this our little secret, okay?

60
00:06:28,943 --> 00:06:32,001
You never saw me.
I was never here.

61
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:48,309
<i>So, what were you expecting?</i>

62
00:06:48,467 --> 00:06:52,025
<i>A dirty little hedgehog eating berries,
and struggling to survive?</i>

63
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:56,690
<i>Think again, because I am living
my best life on Earth.</i>

64
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,454
<i>I've got a library.</i>

65
00:07:00,155 --> 00:07:01,629
<i>A home gym.</i>

66
00:07:01,778 --> 00:07:04,201
<i>And a state of the art security system.</i>

67
00:07:16,827 --> 00:07:18,598
Oh, no!

68
00:07:19,067 --> 00:07:22,169
<i>And if I ever discovered,
I'll follow Longclaw's instructions,</i>

69
00:07:22,318 --> 00:07:24,879
<i>and use my rings
to escape to a new planet.</i>

70
00:07:25,367 --> 00:07:28,917
<i>A nice, safe little world
filled only with mushrooms.</i>

71
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,596
<i>Gross, smelly mushrooms...</i>

72
00:07:34,747 --> 00:07:36,332
I hate mushrooms.

73
00:07:37,693 --> 00:07:39,607
<i>But let's not worry about all of that.</i>

74
00:07:39,845 --> 00:07:42,315
<i>This is Green Hills.</i>

75
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:44,720
<i>The greatest place on Earth.</i>

76
00:07:45,797 --> 00:07:50,626
<i>These are my people, and there, I say,
I am their lovable space creature.</i>

77
00:07:50,775 --> 00:07:53,230
<i>So what if they don't know I exist?</i>

78
00:07:54,456 --> 00:07:57,549
<i>My favorite person is the Donut Lord.</i>

79
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:00,484
<i>Protector of this town,</i>

80
00:08:00,864 --> 00:08:04,025
<i>and defender of all creatures,
big and small.</i>

81
00:08:04,205 --> 00:08:06,782
Morning, Donald, Daisy, Daffy.

82
00:08:07,973 --> 00:08:10,414
<i>Donut Lord lives with Pretzel Lady.</i>

83
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:15,636
<i>She is super nice to animals,
and strangely was born without bones.</i>

84
00:08:18,446 --> 00:08:21,491
<i>There is one person in town
who's actually onto me.</i>

85
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:23,713
<i>He calls me The Blue Devil.</i>

86
00:08:23,903 --> 00:08:27,320
- I almost caught him last night.
- <i>Say hello to Crazy Carl.</i>

87
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,180
<i>We have fun together.</i>

88
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:36,845
I know you're out there!

89
00:08:37,053 --> 00:08:39,649
And I know you're real!

90
00:08:40,142 --> 00:08:42,011
No, I'm not.

91
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:44,949
<i>Movie night is my favorite.</i>

92
00:08:45,088 --> 00:08:46,713
Please, please...

93
00:08:47,108 --> 00:08:50,206
Yes! Keanu, you are a national treasure.

94
00:08:50,349 --> 00:08:52,726
<i>- When I find you...
- Pop quiz hot-shot.</i>

95
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:54,406
<i>There's a bomb on the bus.</i>

96
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:57,787
Pop quiz hot-shot.
It's a classic line.

97
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,762
<i>Basically, we're like a family,</i>

98
00:09:01,017 --> 00:09:02,862
<i>even though we haven't met yet.</i>

99
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:07,820
You don't think your prolonged isolation
is making you a bit crazy perhaps?

100
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:12,438
Crazy? Me? No way, Doc.
You got me all wrong.

101
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,550
And despite all these
so called friends of yours,

102
00:09:15,678 --> 00:09:18,758
deep down you are still rather lonely?

103
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:27,739
<i>Perhaps afraid you'll be alone forever?</i>

104
00:09:43,304 --> 00:09:45,385
Hey! No, no...

105
00:09:46,055 --> 00:09:49,711
Get out of there! Come on!
Oh, come on! Get out of there!

106
00:09:50,138 --> 00:09:52,514
Get out of there, you trash pandas!

107
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:56,760
Maddie, as Green Hills
most respected veterinarian,

108
00:09:56,934 --> 00:09:59,711
what is the fastest way
to exterminate a racoon?

109
00:10:00,106 --> 00:10:02,697
Hi, Ozzy. Hello.
You're glad to see me?

110
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:04,393
You don't eat garbage, do you?

111
00:10:04,765 --> 00:10:06,292
What's that?

112
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:09,144
- Is that what I think it is?
- Open it.

113
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:14,027
- It's kinda small, is that bad?
- Just... open it.

114
00:10:19,836 --> 00:10:21,920
Dear Thomas, we have reviewed
your application

115
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,739
to the San Francisco Police Department,

116
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:26,468
and pending inter departmental review
and background check.

117
00:10:26,564 --> 00:10:30,489
And we are happy to inform you that you
have been selected to join our team.

118
00:10:30,649 --> 00:10:32,757
Wow! Oh my God!

119
00:10:35,628 --> 00:10:37,323
San Francisco sucks?

120
00:10:39,593 --> 00:10:41,116
Wrong one.

121
00:10:45,723 --> 00:10:47,852
- You never had a doubt, huh?
- No!

122
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:53,921
- I can't believe this!
- I know. You did it!

123
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,287
What are those?

124
00:10:58,314 --> 00:11:00,700
Apartments for rent I found on Zillow.

125
00:11:00,884 --> 00:11:03,552
I though Ozzy and I
can fly there tomorrow,

126
00:11:03,719 --> 00:11:06,025
and check out some neighborhoods.

127
00:11:06,622 --> 00:11:08,785
I mean, this is all happening so fast.

128
00:11:10,032 --> 00:11:14,790
Man, it's the craziest thing,
you apply for the job, you get the job.

129
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:17,050
- Well, pending a background check.
- Oh, man,

130
00:11:17,177 --> 00:11:20,853
hope they don't find out about that time
you used the neighbor's WiFi.

131
00:11:21,022 --> 00:11:23,491
Correction, I'm still using
the neighbor's WiFi.

132
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:25,182
But, Maddie...

133
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:27,189
Are you sure you're okay with this?

134
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:28,926
Thomas Michael Wachowski,

135
00:11:29,042 --> 00:11:31,561
what did you do the entire time
I was in a veterinary school?

136
00:11:31,692 --> 00:11:33,681
I worked the second job
to pay the rent, and...

137
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:35,698
A third job to pay tuition.

138
00:11:35,856 --> 00:11:39,899
You sacrificed for me,
I'm happy to sacrifice for you.

139
00:11:40,826 --> 00:11:43,734
Babe, are you sure you're okay with this?

140
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,760
I mean, there's been a Wachowski protecting
this town for more than 50 years.

141
00:11:49,769 --> 00:11:51,766
This is a big change.

142
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:53,896
I'm positive.

143
00:11:54,827 --> 00:11:57,235
It's time for this guy to get out there
and prove himself.

144
00:11:57,366 --> 00:11:59,223
I love Green Hills, but...

145
00:11:59,368 --> 00:12:01,669
You know, I wanna help people
in real trouble.

146
00:12:02,029 --> 00:12:04,789
I want someone to turn to me
in a life-or-death situation,

147
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:06,509
and I'll be there for them.

148
00:12:07,161 --> 00:12:11,273
- I get it. I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

149
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:15,165
And so it is with a heavy heart,
that I tell you all

150
00:12:15,311 --> 00:12:18,394
that I've accepted a position
at the San Francisco Police Department

151
00:12:18,582 --> 00:12:20,110
effective immediately.

152
00:12:20,341 --> 00:12:23,607
It's gonna be tough to leave my home town,
and all my friendships.

153
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,952
But this is something
I feel like I need to do,

154
00:12:27,946 --> 00:12:32,274
to grow, as both an officer, and a man.

155
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:37,593
What do you think, Sergeant Sprinkles?

156
00:12:38,427 --> 00:12:40,120
That wasn't so bad, right?

157
00:12:41,538 --> 00:12:43,264
Now all I gotta do is...

158
00:12:44,054 --> 00:12:45,872
tell everyone who isn't a donut.

159
00:12:48,002 --> 00:12:50,411
Whoa, the play-offs.

160
00:13:34,963 --> 00:13:36,859
So cool.

161
00:13:41,116 --> 00:13:42,528
Bottom of the ninth, tie score.

162
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:46,285
And exactly who you want at the plate
with the game on the line, Sonic.

163
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,354
But staring him down
from the pitcher's mound

164
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:52,776
is the most fearsome southpaw
in Green Hills, also Sonic.

165
00:13:53,016 --> 00:13:54,301
Okay, focus, Sonic.

166
00:13:54,456 --> 00:13:58,046
If you win this game you'll be
the most beloved kid in Green Hills.

167
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:05,586
Hit it to the guy in left,
he's a real space case.

168
00:14:08,845 --> 00:14:10,457
I can't with that guy.

169
00:14:10,646 --> 00:14:14,759
Hey, batter Sonic, hey, batter Sonic,
is so in batter Sonic.

170
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,635
I got it, I got it...

171
00:14:24,802 --> 00:14:26,318
I don't got it.

172
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,958
Go home! Go home!

173
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:38,970
Come on!

174
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,393
Safe!

175
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:49,855
Yes! Yes! I did it!

176
00:14:49,996 --> 00:14:52,701
Did you see that? I did it! I did it.

177
00:15:05,903 --> 00:15:07,926
I really am alone.

178
00:15:08,484 --> 00:15:11,085
All alone. Forever.

179
00:15:45,329 --> 00:15:48,380
I'm sure no one noticed
that giant blue explosion, right?

180
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:01,458
- Hey, Wade.
- Hi, Tom. Wade here.

181
00:16:02,505 --> 00:16:04,178
What is going on?

182
00:16:04,318 --> 00:16:06,706
- Oh Gosh, I think the power is out.
- Yap, dur.

183
00:16:06,834 --> 00:16:09,353
The lights are out.
The whole town is freaking out.

184
00:16:09,753 --> 00:16:11,446
- What should I do?
- Okay. Relax.

185
00:16:11,572 --> 00:16:13,410
Take a deep breath, call Gil,

186
00:16:13,536 --> 00:16:16,024
see if they can locate
the down line, then...

187
00:16:16,515 --> 00:16:19,317
call Zim, and see if he can get
his generator over to the Super Cue

188
00:16:19,456 --> 00:16:24,339
- so the food stays fresh.
- Call Zim before Gil?

189
00:16:24,887 --> 00:16:27,300
- Call Gil... Hello? Wait. Wait!
- I'll call you back.

190
00:16:27,446 --> 00:16:29,985
Hello? Was that the end
of the instructions?

191
00:16:31,014 --> 00:16:33,675
Okay. All right. You can do this.

192
00:16:34,521 --> 00:16:37,734
What was the first thing he said to do?

193
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:41,370
Right. Relax.

194
00:17:01,681 --> 00:17:04,585
Twenty minutes ago an energy surge
knocked our power

195
00:17:04,735 --> 00:17:07,304
across the entire Pacific Northwest.
What do we know?

196
00:17:07,503 --> 00:17:09,868
Our first instinct was it was an EMP.

197
00:17:10,639 --> 00:17:13,369
But electromagnetic pulses
don't have that kind of power.

198
00:17:13,551 --> 00:17:16,001
NASA has ruled out
meteor strikes or solar flares.

199
00:17:16,131 --> 00:17:19,074
The Department of Energy says
it's not a power plant malfunction.

200
00:17:19,178 --> 00:17:22,009
Sounds like we're really good
at figuring out what it wasn't.

201
00:17:22,137 --> 00:17:24,227
This could be a prelude
to a larger attack.

202
00:17:24,366 --> 00:17:27,584
I'm suggesting we scramble the fifth and sixth regiment.
- No, no...

203
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:31,925
This needs a much more sophisticated mind.
Someone who understands technology.

204
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:34,769
- You wanna send in a lab rat?
- Not just any lab rat.

205
00:17:34,934 --> 00:17:36,094
A lab rat with teeth.

206
00:17:36,196 --> 00:17:38,612
You're not suggesting who I think
you're suggesting.

207
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:40,636
- I know he's a little weird...
- Weird?

208
00:17:40,754 --> 00:17:43,217
- No, no. No way!
- He's a psychological tire fire.

209
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:46,650
But he's also brilliant. Five PhDs.
IQ off the charts.

210
00:17:46,812 --> 00:17:49,438
And his drone tech is revolutionary.

211
00:17:49,592 --> 00:17:53,310
- You're sure he can handle this?
- He has a perfect operations record.

212
00:17:53,618 --> 00:17:55,521
- Remember the coup in Pakistan?
- No.

213
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:58,382
- Or the uprising in Azerbaijanistan?
- It's not even a country.

214
00:17:58,514 --> 00:18:01,508
Exactly. And you can thank
Robotnik for that.

215
00:18:01,646 --> 00:18:04,909
I can't believe you're bringing
that freak into this.

216
00:18:05,162 --> 00:18:07,540
Neither can I, but...

217
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:09,487
We have no choice.

218
00:18:17,531 --> 00:18:19,095
Guys, coming up!

219
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:22,052
Yes, Major.

220
00:18:35,257 --> 00:18:36,334
What the...

221
00:18:57,848 --> 00:18:59,163
Are you in charge here?

222
00:18:59,285 --> 00:19:01,700
- Yes, I am.
- No. Wrong!

223
00:19:01,869 --> 00:19:03,143
- Name...
- I'm in charge!

224
00:19:03,292 --> 00:19:04,640
- Me!
- Is Major...

225
00:19:04,803 --> 00:19:06,776
- Ben...
- I'm in charge.

226
00:19:07,879 --> 00:19:09,989
You've never seen anything
like this before?

227
00:19:10,224 --> 00:19:14,567
It says I'm a top banana in a world
full of hungry little monkeys.

228
00:19:14,692 --> 00:19:16,410
Allow me to clarify.

229
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,921
In a sequentially ranked hierarchy
based on level of critical importance

230
00:19:20,051 --> 00:19:23,109
the disparity between us
is too vast to quantify. Agent Stone.

231
00:19:23,279 --> 00:19:26,883
- The Doctor thinks you're basic.
- I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

232
00:19:27,106 --> 00:19:29,619
Ten miles in every direction
should suffice.

233
00:19:30,579 --> 00:19:32,542
- Is he still looking at me funny?
- Yes, he is.

234
00:19:32,684 --> 00:19:34,812
Tell him to stop or I'll pull out
his search history.

235
00:19:34,925 --> 00:19:37,525
If you don't stop looking, the Doctor,
he'll take a closer look...

236
00:19:37,616 --> 00:19:40,748
- I'm not deaf.
- And tell him his men report to me now.

237
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:44,353
Excuse me? Listen, pal,
I don't know if you realize...

238
00:19:44,482 --> 00:19:46,163
I'm sorry, Major, what was your name?

239
00:19:46,307 --> 00:19:49,751
- Benning...
- Nobody cares! Nobody cares.

240
00:19:50,043 --> 00:19:52,251
Listen, Major Nobodycares.

241
00:19:52,397 --> 00:19:54,547
You know why
nobody cares who you are?

242
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:57,566
Because nobody cares about your feeble
accomplishments.

243
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,172
And nobody cares about how proud
your Mommy is

244
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,756
that you're now reading
at a third grade level.

245
00:20:03,472 --> 00:20:07,469
Have you finished 'Charlotte's Web' yet?
Spoiler alert, she dies in the end.

246
00:20:07,599 --> 00:20:10,230
But she leaves a big creepy egg sac.

247
00:20:11,842 --> 00:20:13,999
Oh, my babies.

248
00:20:14,738 --> 00:20:17,127
Look what came out of my egg sac.

249
00:20:17,316 --> 00:20:19,399
You know what I love about machines?

250
00:20:20,325 --> 00:20:23,458
They do what they're told.
They follow their programming.

251
00:20:23,644 --> 00:20:27,218
They don't need time-off to get drunk,
and put the boat in the water.

252
00:20:27,633 --> 00:20:29,557
And you do what you're told.

253
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:32,184
Stand over there on the edge
of your personal abyss.

254
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:35,687
And watch my machines do your job.

255
00:20:38,113 --> 00:20:40,904
- Can you feel it, Stone?
- I can feel it, Doctor.

256
00:20:41,292 --> 00:20:42,892
It's evolution, Stone.

257
00:20:44,248 --> 00:20:46,059
It's evolution!

258
00:21:21,261 --> 00:21:23,419
- Agent Stone?
- Doctor.

259
00:21:23,861 --> 00:21:26,071
Do you see anything useful in this image?

260
00:21:26,965 --> 00:21:29,382
- Nothing at all, Doctor.
- Of course you don't.

261
00:21:29,712 --> 00:21:31,701
Your eyes weren't expertly trained
to spot tracks

262
00:21:31,864 --> 00:21:34,131
by the Native American Shadow Wolves.

263
00:21:44,251 --> 00:21:45,791
That's extraordinary.

264
00:21:45,989 --> 00:21:48,169
No, what extraordinary is...

265
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:52,003
I determined the exact height, weight,
and spinal curvature of this creature.

266
00:21:52,168 --> 00:21:55,028
And my computer can't find
a single match for it, anywhere

267
00:21:55,374 --> 00:21:57,603
in Earth's animal kingdom.

268
00:21:57,904 --> 00:22:02,191
This blackout was not a terrorist attack,
and that's no baby Bigfoot.

269
00:22:02,748 --> 00:22:05,859
This guy is something else

270
00:22:07,532 --> 00:22:09,244
entirely.

271
00:22:09,606 --> 00:22:12,410
Divert all search units
to the site of the footprint.

272
00:22:13,005 --> 00:22:15,449
That's one small step for man,

273
00:22:15,607 --> 00:22:17,934
one giant leap for me.

274
00:22:29,262 --> 00:22:31,212
Okay, okay. Everything is fine.

275
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:33,424
You played some baseball,
got a little upset.

276
00:22:33,573 --> 00:22:36,834
Lightning shut out of your butt,
and now they're coming for you.

277
00:22:37,464 --> 00:22:39,528
All right, all right.
Earth isn't safe anymore.

278
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,484
Time for plan B - Mushroomville.
I gotta take my stuff.

279
00:22:42,585 --> 00:22:44,472
Okay, essential items only.

280
00:22:44,615 --> 00:22:47,372
Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste,
hair gel, night light, funny hat.

281
00:22:47,753 --> 00:22:50,620
This half-eaten cantaloupe,
and my scented candle.

282
00:22:50,972 --> 00:22:52,606
My entire comic book collection.

283
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,391
Bean bag chair, can a bean bag chair
fit in the backpack? No, no.

284
00:22:55,586 --> 00:22:57,004
Of course not. That's stupid.

285
00:22:57,149 --> 00:23:00,424
Okay, what else? The rings!
The rings, yes, of course!

286
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:05,122
Here we go. Ring time.
Mushroom planet, here I come.

287
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:08,823
Oh, no! They're right outside,
I gotta go somewhere else.

288
00:23:13,620 --> 00:23:15,457
Goodbye, cave.

289
00:23:19,474 --> 00:23:20,964
- Hi.
- Hey.

290
00:23:21,132 --> 00:23:22,172
What are you doing?

291
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:25,055
Just coloring with Jojo and Rachel.

292
00:23:25,415 --> 00:23:27,068
That sounds half-fun.

293
00:23:27,213 --> 00:23:29,523
Hey, exciting stuff here.
We had a power outage.

294
00:23:29,676 --> 00:23:31,481
The whole town went dark.

295
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,778
It was like a sign telling me
to get outta Dodge.

296
00:23:33,811 --> 00:23:35,783
- Wade must've lost his mind.
- Yeah.

297
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:37,938
And he does not have much to lose.

298
00:23:38,172 --> 00:23:40,758
How's your sister? Does she
convince you to leave me yet?

299
00:23:40,889 --> 00:23:44,203
No, but she did tell me to check
your phone for dating apps.

300
00:23:44,354 --> 00:23:46,785
The only apps on my phone
are the ones that came with it.

301
00:23:46,947 --> 00:23:49,228
- And the Olive Garden.
- Ah, because when you're there...

302
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:51,001
You're family.

303
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:54,322
No way!

304
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:00,078
The racoons are back.
And they are in for a surprise.

305
00:24:00,205 --> 00:24:03,584
Your surprise better not be
my tranquilizer gun. They're just hungry.

306
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:06,313
And also, that's for bears.

307
00:24:07,205 --> 00:24:09,245
- Good, now I know it'll work.
- Tom!

308
00:24:09,425 --> 00:24:11,799
I'm kidding, I'm just gonna use it
to scare them.

309
00:24:11,913 --> 00:24:14,461
- Possibly to death. Love you, honey, bye.
- To...

310
00:24:19,006 --> 00:24:21,732
D-I-V-O-R-C-E.

311
00:24:23,847 --> 00:24:27,688
Okay, I'm in. With minimal damage
to Donut Lord's property.

312
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:29,820
Here we go.

313
00:24:29,871 --> 00:24:33,194
Didn't work out on Earth, but that's okay.
You're going to a safe world.

314
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:38,775
A nice safe world full of mushrooms.
Mushrooms that will be your only friends.

315
00:24:38,863 --> 00:24:40,821
That sounds awful, I can't do this.

316
00:24:40,966 --> 00:24:43,212
You have to do it,
there's no other option.

317
00:24:45,191 --> 00:24:46,618
All right.

318
00:24:47,642 --> 00:24:51,017
SFPD, pending background check.
Paws in the air!

319
00:24:53,634 --> 00:24:55,790
Uhhh... meow?

320
00:25:04,444 --> 00:25:07,378
San Francisco?

321
00:25:29,578 --> 00:25:31,024
No.

322
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:36,784
What?

323
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:01,184
The Blue Devil.

324
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:16,038
- Donut Lord?
- You can talk?

325
00:26:17,085 --> 00:26:18,264
You're not...

326
00:26:18,428 --> 00:26:21,439
- You're not here to abduct me, are you?
- You abducted me!

327
00:26:22,702 --> 00:26:24,968
Okay, it's a fair point. What are you?

328
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:26,898
Why are you hiding out in my garage?

329
00:26:27,032 --> 00:26:28,232
I needed somewhere safe,

330
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:30,919
and you are the only person
I could think of, Donut Lord.

331
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:33,803
- Why do you keep calling me Donut Lord?
- 'Cause you talk to donuts,

332
00:26:33,962 --> 00:26:35,840
and then eat them
if they get out of the line.

333
00:26:35,968 --> 00:26:38,267
- Again, fair.
- Wait... Where are all the mushrooms?

334
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:42,915
Why am I still on Earth? What did...
Oh, no, I lost my rings!

335
00:26:43,032 --> 00:26:44,431
What?

336
00:26:49,902 --> 00:26:52,297
What's happening?
Is this your mothership?

337
00:26:53,364 --> 00:26:55,930
- I'm not in the mood to get probed.
- You think you're worried?

338
00:26:56,055 --> 00:26:57,697
I'm not even wearing pants.

339
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:02,576
What the...

340
00:27:03,977 --> 00:27:06,222
- They're coming for me!
- Who's coming for you?

341
00:27:06,314 --> 00:27:08,994
- What does that have to do with me?
- I don't have time to explain,

342
00:27:09,097 --> 00:27:11,783
- but you have to help me.
- No, I don't. Why?

343
00:27:11,932 --> 00:27:15,254
Well, my legs, which normally
would be classified as lethal weapons

344
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,574
feel like spaghetti.

345
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:19,815
I need your help, please.
It's life or death.

346
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:29,030
Fine, come with me.

347
00:27:32,447 --> 00:27:34,061
Little help?

348
00:27:44,922 --> 00:27:48,100
- All right, stay here. And be quiet.
- Good plan, great plan.

349
00:27:48,239 --> 00:27:52,100
How are we working so well together?
Practically finishing each other sentences.

350
00:27:53,390 --> 00:27:54,558
Okay, bye.

351
00:27:58,004 --> 00:27:59,494
Hello there.

352
00:28:00,203 --> 00:28:01,747
Can I help you?

353
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:07,250
Good morning, my rural chum.

354
00:28:07,746 --> 00:28:08,873
I'm...

355
00:28:09,162 --> 00:28:11,629
from the power company,
investigating the blackout.

356
00:28:11,781 --> 00:28:15,028
If you don't mind I'd like to take
a few readings inside your house?

357
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:17,088
No kidding, you're from
the power company?

358
00:28:17,224 --> 00:28:20,165
You must know my buddy Spencer.
We play softball together.

359
00:28:20,309 --> 00:28:22,948
Spence, he's a good man.

360
00:28:24,229 --> 00:28:26,776
- Yeah, yeah... come on in!
- Great.

361
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:29,218
Take all the readings
you need. Except...

362
00:28:30,184 --> 00:28:33,453
Don't the power company usually take
their readings from outside the house?

363
00:28:33,571 --> 00:28:35,844
That way they can check
even if you're not home.

364
00:28:36,108 --> 00:28:38,598
Also, my buddy Spencer
works for the gas company.

365
00:28:38,724 --> 00:28:41,667
And he's more of an ultimate Frisbee guy.
So, you wanna tell me why

366
00:28:41,964 --> 00:28:45,274
you think I'm dumb enough
to just let you walk inside my house?

367
00:28:53,216 --> 00:28:55,729
- I'm sorry, Mr...?
- Wachowski.

368
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:57,424
But everyone calls me Tom.

369
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:59,662
Except my dentist, he calls me Tim.

370
00:28:59,795 --> 00:29:03,266
But it's gone on for so long now that
it would be just weird if I corrected him.

371
00:29:03,412 --> 00:29:05,513
Well, Tom, whose dentist calls him Tim.

372
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:09,697
You may have noticed that this entire town
has been experiencing a power outage.

373
00:29:09,838 --> 00:29:11,665
Yup, no lights, picked up on that.

374
00:29:11,716 --> 00:29:13,736
Twenty minutes ago I tracked
an energy pulse

375
00:29:13,865 --> 00:29:17,013
with the similar signature to the one
that caused that disruption.

376
00:29:31,693 --> 00:29:33,455
Listen, Mr...?

377
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:36,167
Doctor. Doctor Robotnik.

378
00:29:36,346 --> 00:29:38,206
But my dentist calls me Rob.

379
00:29:39,498 --> 00:29:42,585
Look, Doctor Robotskiz...

380
00:29:43,108 --> 00:29:45,156
I'm sure what you're here for
is very serious,

381
00:29:45,286 --> 00:29:48,095
but it's got nothing to do with me,
you can ask anyone in town.

382
00:29:48,209 --> 00:29:49,897
- Everyone knows me.
- I bet they do.

383
00:29:50,046 --> 00:29:52,459
I'm sure you're hella popular
with the Jebs and Merles

384
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,789
and Billy Bobs in this glorified
gas station rest stop.

385
00:29:56,107 --> 00:30:00,161
Betcha go way back to the days
of tipping cows and playing in a jug band.

386
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:05,859
And maybe some day
you'll have achieved your goal

387
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:08,777
of getting a Costco card,
or adopting a Labradoodle.

388
00:30:08,935 --> 00:30:14,205
But the reality is, I surpassed
everything you're ever going to do

389
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:17,980
before I was a toddler.

390
00:30:18,131 --> 00:30:21,702
I was spitting out formulas
while you were still spitting up formula.

391
00:30:21,828 --> 00:30:24,404
- I was breastfed, actually.
- Nice.

392
00:30:24,638 --> 00:30:26,854
Rub that in my orphan face.

393
00:30:27,072 --> 00:30:32,877
Mr. Wachowski, are you familiar
with US code 904, title 10, article 104?

394
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,040
- Yeah...
- Anyone, who attempts to aid

395
00:30:36,199 --> 00:30:39,031
an enemy of the United States
shall suffer death.

396
00:30:40,903 --> 00:30:42,908
And if I'm the one who catches you,

397
00:30:43,373 --> 00:30:45,228
it'll be even worse.

398
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:48,080
Worse than death?

399
00:30:50,288 --> 00:30:52,004
Okay, I'm a ball.
Just a normal ball.

400
00:30:52,151 --> 00:30:53,412
I'm blending in like a bulge.

401
00:30:53,548 --> 00:30:57,306
Stop talking. No, you stop talking.
Be quiet, Sonic. You be quiet, Sonic!

402
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:59,560
Oh, I hope they aren't scanning me
with X-Rays,

403
00:30:59,693 --> 00:31:01,957
I had kind of an embarrassing lunch.

404
00:31:09,469 --> 00:31:11,760
Don't freak out. Don't freak...
Don't freak out.

405
00:31:11,919 --> 00:31:13,916
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

406
00:31:15,341 --> 00:31:16,729
I'm freaking out!

407
00:31:19,132 --> 00:31:21,543
Why don't you have
your staircase carpeted?

408
00:31:21,696 --> 00:31:23,039
Did you hear that?

409
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,397
- Old pipes.
- Yeah.

410
00:31:27,547 --> 00:31:30,188
Probably just the house settling.
Nothing to see here.

411
00:31:31,787 --> 00:31:33,054
Hey!

412
00:31:38,175 --> 00:31:39,651
Here's the thing.

413
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,931
I'm never wrong.

414
00:31:43,695 --> 00:31:46,017
Well, first time for everything, I guess.

415
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,361
Would you like some cake?

416
00:31:47,544 --> 00:31:51,676
I hear racoons have the cleanest mouths
of any animal that routinely eats garbage.

417
00:32:02,957 --> 00:32:04,720
Look at that.

418
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:06,878
I was right.

419
00:32:07,293 --> 00:32:09,220
Note the lack of surprise.

420
00:32:09,417 --> 00:32:11,146
Should we try this again?

421
00:32:21,651 --> 00:32:25,872
I'm going to give you five seconds
to tell me where it is. Five.

422
00:32:25,999 --> 00:32:28,080
- I don't know what's you're talking about.
- Four.

423
00:32:28,237 --> 00:32:30,637
Hey, tough guy, I'm a cop.
And you're threatening an Officer.

424
00:32:30,738 --> 00:32:33,406
How can you threaten somebody
who never existed? Three.

425
00:32:33,975 --> 00:32:35,968
Come on, rack your brain!

426
00:32:36,135 --> 00:32:39,422
You might be able to come up
with some lame excuse to go on living.

427
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,133
In two...

428
00:32:41,874 --> 00:32:43,138
One!

429
00:32:43,504 --> 00:32:45,467
Wait! Don't hurt him.

430
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,709
This feels excessive.

431
00:33:04,154 --> 00:33:05,296
Stay behind me.

432
00:33:21,489 --> 00:33:23,952
Don't worry, I got it
right where I want it.

433
00:33:26,532 --> 00:33:29,956
Can you believe Amazon is gonna deliver
packages with these things?

434
00:33:32,435 --> 00:33:35,201
This was a horrible plan,
what was I thinking?

435
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:39,501
I'm gonna puke!

436
00:33:43,146 --> 00:33:44,239
Come on!

437
00:33:45,164 --> 00:33:46,419
We gotta get out of here.

438
00:33:46,588 --> 00:33:49,648
Don't tell me that's all you've got.
I'm just getting started.

439
00:33:49,773 --> 00:33:52,504
Let me know if you wanna go
round two with the blue.

440
00:34:11,331 --> 00:34:12,496
Doctor!

441
00:34:12,864 --> 00:34:13,947
Are you okay?

442
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:16,282
I just saw a guy race
outta here and thought...

443
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:17,845
That you should stop them?

444
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:20,503
Open your mouth,

445
00:34:20,707 --> 00:34:22,735
and say you thought
that you should stop them.

446
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:26,049
No, I thought that maybe I should
check to see if you're okay.

447
00:34:26,346 --> 00:34:29,071
You know what's hard about being
the smartest person in the world?

448
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:32,101
- Everyone else seems stupid.
- Yes. Way to go.

449
00:34:32,336 --> 00:34:33,791
You got that one.

450
00:34:35,033 --> 00:34:38,740
Whatever this creature is,
it's our job to secure it,

451
00:34:39,242 --> 00:34:42,427
neutralize it, uncover
the source of its power.

452
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,481
And if it resists...

453
00:34:45,525 --> 00:34:47,078
we take it apart,

454
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:49,099
piece by piece.

455
00:34:50,295 --> 00:34:52,207
See what makes it tick.

456
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:54,598
- Stone.
- Doctor.

457
00:34:54,745 --> 00:34:56,401
Call Optical Illusions.

458
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,788
Tell them I need new frames.

459
00:34:59,425 --> 00:35:01,032
They know what kind I like.

460
00:35:02,885 --> 00:35:04,532
And bring that quill.

461
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,407
Yes, Doctor.

462
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:10,962
All right, pal,

463
00:35:11,021 --> 00:35:12,690
You need to start talking right now.

464
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:15,185
Who are you? <i>What</i> are you?

465
00:35:15,354 --> 00:35:17,692
I'm a hedgehog,
I feel like that's obvious.

466
00:35:17,888 --> 00:35:20,466
- And I'm in big trouble.
- You're in big trouble?

467
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:23,580
You're not the one who punched
some sort of government weirdo back there.

468
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:25,946
You think you have problems?
I lost my rings!

469
00:35:26,076 --> 00:35:27,610
Rings? What are you talking about?

470
00:35:27,741 --> 00:35:31,214
Okay, rings are how all advanced cultures
travel between worlds.

471
00:35:31,584 --> 00:35:33,922
And now mine are on top
of a pointy building

472
00:35:34,074 --> 00:35:36,845
I've only ever seen
on your skin tight t-shirt.

473
00:35:37,202 --> 00:35:39,363
So, I'd like you to take me
to San Francisco,

474
00:35:39,575 --> 00:35:42,702
so I can get back my rings and use them
to go to the Mushroom planet.

475
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:46,897
- Mushroom planet?
- Yes!

476
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,426
Right.

477
00:35:52,287 --> 00:35:54,879
- Okay, pal. Out you go.
- I'm sorry, what?

478
00:35:55,025 --> 00:35:58,892
Look, this is the worst possible time
for me to get myself into trouble, okay?

479
00:35:59,001 --> 00:36:01,125
You asked me to save your life,
I saved your life.

480
00:36:01,248 --> 00:36:04,179
Now please, go find your rings,
and your Mushroomland.

481
00:36:04,331 --> 00:36:06,451
Hopefully I'm gonna wake up
in the hospital bed,

482
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:09,399
and the doctors gonna tell me
that my colonoscopy was a big success.

483
00:36:09,541 --> 00:36:11,761
- Okay? So, goodbye.
- Okay, goodbye.

484
00:36:12,279 --> 00:36:13,382
Goodbye.

485
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:18,683
- Why aren't you leaving?
- I don't know where San Francisco is.

486
00:36:18,822 --> 00:36:19,822
- It's West.
- West?

487
00:36:19,933 --> 00:36:22,199
- Straight shot, can't miss it.
- Fine. That's cool.

488
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,374
I'm totally cool saying goodbye now.

489
00:36:29,297 --> 00:36:33,139
So, as I crashed into the cold
dark water of the Pacific

490
00:36:33,479 --> 00:36:35,282
I realized a few things.

491
00:36:35,817 --> 00:36:38,020
A) I have no idea where I'm going;

492
00:36:38,354 --> 00:36:40,384
b) salt water stings.

493
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:44,961
C) I shouldn't even be on this planet
right now, but I am.

494
00:36:45,101 --> 00:36:47,898
- Why? Because you shot me!
- I know.

495
00:36:48,111 --> 00:36:49,192
You shot me!

496
00:36:49,333 --> 00:36:52,000
All right. I heard you the first time.
You don't have to...

497
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:53,642
pile it on, good grief.

498
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:55,949
I'm wet. I'm cold.

499
00:36:56,318 --> 00:36:58,058
There's a fish on my head!

500
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,719
And clearly I'm not gonna be able
to do this on my own.

501
00:37:07,694 --> 00:37:10,376
- All right, get in the truck.
- Really? You gonna help me?

502
00:37:10,460 --> 00:37:13,650
I guess it is a little bit of my fault
that all of this is happening to you.

503
00:37:13,782 --> 00:37:16,675
Not a little bit, entirely.
It is entirely your fault.

504
00:37:16,818 --> 00:37:18,724
Okay, it's entirely my fault.
Are you coming?

505
00:37:18,847 --> 00:37:19,954
Yes.

506
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,309
Roadtrip.

507
00:37:24,804 --> 00:37:26,247
What am I doing?

508
00:37:26,673 --> 00:37:29,233
All right, there's gonna be rules
on this trip. Number one:

509
00:37:29,366 --> 00:37:31,570
do exactly as I say all the time.

510
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:33,864
- Got it?
- Got it, Donut Lord.

511
00:37:34,007 --> 00:37:35,841
Would you stop with the Donut Lord?

512
00:37:36,211 --> 00:37:38,045
I have a name. It's Tom.

513
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,712
I'm Sonic.

514
00:37:39,906 --> 00:37:42,056
Sonic? Sonic.

515
00:37:43,176 --> 00:37:45,357
So, you've been spying
on us all for years.

516
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:47,231
I mean, I wouldn't call it spying.

517
00:37:47,363 --> 00:37:49,619
We were all just hanging out,
only I wasn't invited,

518
00:37:49,746 --> 00:37:51,253
and no one knew I was there.

519
00:37:51,388 --> 00:37:54,019
I can't believe Crazy Carl
was right all this time.

520
00:37:54,167 --> 00:37:57,069
Yeah, you should call him
Super Observant Carl instead.

521
00:37:57,638 --> 00:37:59,918
- Oh my God, stop the car right now!
- What? What?

522
00:38:00,081 --> 00:38:03,404
The World's Largest Rubber Band Ball?
We gotta see it!

523
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:06,999
No, no. This is not some fun
family roadtrip, okay?

524
00:38:07,248 --> 00:38:11,246
The government wants to dissect you,
and arrest me. This is serious.

525
00:38:12,876 --> 00:38:15,287
You were right. It was lame.
Gift shop was cool, though.

526
00:38:15,528 --> 00:38:16,753
I got you a mouse pad.

527
00:38:17,027 --> 00:38:18,612
When are we gonna get there?

528
00:38:18,646 --> 00:38:20,534
We will get there when we get there.

529
00:38:39,578 --> 00:38:42,892
All right, I'm gonna go check in with Wade
to see if he knows what's going on.

530
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:45,216
You gonna see Wade in that glass thing?

531
00:38:45,367 --> 00:38:47,315
What is it? A teleportation box?

532
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:50,075
It's a pay phone.

533
00:38:50,176 --> 00:38:53,585
It's mostly for drug dealers and fugitives
from the law, which is us.

534
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,236
Stay in the car. I don't want
anybody seeing you.

535
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:57,838
Fine!

536
00:39:16,361 --> 00:39:21,020
Okay. Okay. That is the coolest place
on Earth, but you have to stay in the car.

537
00:39:30,314 --> 00:39:32,557
Be strong. Be strong.

538
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:41,995
Hello. Green Hills Police Department.

539
00:39:42,145 --> 00:39:44,925
- Wade, it's me.
- Hi, I'm so glad that you called.

540
00:39:45,307 --> 00:39:49,584
So, some guys came in asking
some questions. A little creepy.

541
00:39:49,949 --> 00:39:52,278
Kinda reminded me of the guys
from Men in Black,

542
00:39:52,396 --> 00:39:55,866
but not as likable,
or charming as Will Smith.

543
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:57,604
Wait, what kinda questions?

544
00:39:57,763 --> 00:40:00,020
Questions about terrorism.

545
00:40:00,526 --> 00:40:03,538
I told them that, like...
I've gone ice fishing with Tom.

546
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:07,608
He doesn't know how to make a bomb.
He can't even make, like bait in the cold.

547
00:40:07,737 --> 00:40:09,937
All right, Wade, listen to me.
This is really important.

548
00:40:10,012 --> 00:40:12,102
Don't tell them that we talked, okay?

549
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:17,141
You know, I think they already know.

550
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:20,696
Mr. Wachowski.

551
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:22,783
Tom.

552
00:40:22,809 --> 00:40:24,766
I want you to know
that the only other person

553
00:40:24,828 --> 00:40:27,896
who have ever punched me
in the face was the school bully.

554
00:40:28,025 --> 00:40:30,830
He hit me in the cafeteria
causing a blunt force contusion

555
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,369
to the soft tissue
surrounding my orbital bone.

556
00:40:33,443 --> 00:40:35,542
Humiliated me in front
of the entire school.

557
00:40:35,695 --> 00:40:37,817
And you know what I did in response?

558
00:40:37,974 --> 00:40:40,583
I'm assuming that you reported him
to the Principal's office,

559
00:40:40,698 --> 00:40:43,076
'cause, you know that kinda behavior
is really unacceptable.

560
00:40:43,238 --> 00:40:46,142
No, I examined the inefficiency
of a world where brawn trumped brain,

561
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:49,078
and I used technology
to resolve that inefficiency.

562
00:40:49,225 --> 00:40:51,951
The boy ate his meals
through a straw for a year.

563
00:40:52,222 --> 00:40:55,366
And I have never lost
a fight again. Until today.

564
00:40:56,021 --> 00:40:57,346
Hooray for me then, huh?

565
00:40:57,458 --> 00:41:00,103
No, because you're about
to become the bully with a straw!

566
00:41:00,251 --> 00:41:02,444
I'm coming for you, Mr. Wachowski.

567
00:41:02,839 --> 00:41:04,781
And when I catch you I'll...

568
00:41:05,746 --> 00:41:07,751
Hello? Hello?

569
00:41:08,866 --> 00:41:11,484
- Hello? Hello?
- I think he actually hung up.

570
00:41:11,531 --> 00:41:13,094
Because I noticed
that the light isn't on.

571
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,574
Thank you, Officer Brainfart.

572
00:41:14,598 --> 00:41:16,882
If you give me a second
I can get an outside line.

573
00:41:17,417 --> 00:41:21,388
No, don't be bothered.
You just sit there and be <i>you-</i>

574
00:41:22,594 --> 00:41:24,142
<i>sless.</i>

575
00:41:31,075 --> 00:41:33,732
No one's gonna erase my memory here?

576
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:36,896
I will tell people about this.

577
00:41:40,002 --> 00:41:43,111
Okay, not exactly
the healthiest meal, but...

578
00:41:44,305 --> 00:41:45,463
Sonic?

579
00:41:51,717 --> 00:41:53,065
No, no.

580
00:42:08,364 --> 00:42:09,687
Howdy, partner.

581
00:42:09,810 --> 00:42:11,599
I'm not your partner, come on,
we're leaving.

582
00:42:11,724 --> 00:42:14,462
But there's a ZZ Top cover band,
you gotta see their beards.

583
00:42:14,545 --> 00:42:17,009
We will have to catch them
some other time. Let's go. Get up.

584
00:42:17,146 --> 00:42:20,458
If we stay I promise I won't say
another word for the rest of the trip.

585
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,021
Starting... now.

586
00:42:22,594 --> 00:42:24,986
Welcome to the Piston Pit,
what can I get you fellas?

587
00:42:25,212 --> 00:42:29,605
I want nachos and buffalo wings, and guac.
Funny word, isn't it? Guac. Guac.

588
00:42:30,343 --> 00:42:33,275
No kids allowed in here.
What's he got on, some kinda mask?

589
00:42:34,056 --> 00:42:38,640
He's actually 43 years old,
and suffers from a very rare skin disease.

590
00:42:38,788 --> 00:42:41,131
That stunts his growth,
and makes him look...

591
00:42:41,488 --> 00:42:42,888
like... like that.

592
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:46,959
The face I was born with, the confidence
I picked up along the way.

593
00:42:47,543 --> 00:42:49,904
- Make his a Mellow Yellow please.
- Okay.

594
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:53,748
- You owe me one.
- I've never sat on a bar stool before.

595
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:57,065
So squishy. Oh, look at this, it spins!

596
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:59,146
Yes.

597
00:42:59,803 --> 00:43:01,807
- I feel sick.
- Having fun?

598
00:43:02,099 --> 00:43:04,866
Gonna check this off the ol' bucket list,
huh? Big night for ya?

599
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:06,814
What's a bucket list?

600
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,692
Bucket list is a...

601
00:43:09,097 --> 00:43:12,298
It's a list of things you wanna do
in your life before you...

602
00:43:12,952 --> 00:43:14,115
well, kick the bucket.

603
00:43:14,226 --> 00:43:17,150
I've never kicked the bucket
either. I gotta make my list.

604
00:43:22,927 --> 00:43:24,346
Sonic.

605
00:43:31,356 --> 00:43:32,468
What? What's the matter?

606
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:34,476
There is so much stuff
I've never done.

607
00:43:34,635 --> 00:43:36,916
And now that I'm leaving Earth forever...

608
00:43:37,452 --> 00:43:39,259
I guess I missed my chance.

609
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:47,796
Well, I guess this is the kinda place
you can get a lot of living done

610
00:43:47,939 --> 00:43:49,665
in a short period of time.

611
00:43:50,231 --> 00:43:51,936
I suppose we can spare an hour.

612
00:43:52,113 --> 00:43:54,443
What? You gonna bucket list with me?

613
00:43:54,771 --> 00:43:57,116
- Sure, why not.
- You won't regret this.

614
00:43:57,350 --> 00:43:58,562
I'm pretty sure I will.

615
00:44:23,342 --> 00:44:24,878
New high score.

616
00:44:31,114 --> 00:44:34,886
Wait a second, is this bull missing
a head or does it have two butts?

617
00:44:37,272 --> 00:44:39,384
- This is easy.
- Okay.

618
00:44:44,123 --> 00:44:45,826
I'm a cowboy, baby.

619
00:44:48,849 --> 00:44:50,334
I'm okay.

620
00:44:56,805 --> 00:44:57,951
Yeah!

621
00:45:00,287 --> 00:45:01,899
Yeah, laugh it up.

622
00:45:02,091 --> 00:45:03,697
Nice work, Romeo.

623
00:45:04,176 --> 00:45:06,852
- Glad you're having a good time.
- I am having a good time.

624
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:09,680
I'm having the best time,
I mean what could go wrong?

625
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:14,951
Can we help you?

626
00:45:15,304 --> 00:45:19,290
- We don't like your kind around here.
- Our kind? What kind is that?

627
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:22,583
Hipsters.

628
00:45:23,143 --> 00:45:24,196
How dare you?!

629
00:45:24,309 --> 00:45:26,782
Hey, you know what? We were
just leaving anyway, weren't we?

630
00:45:26,919 --> 00:45:28,592
- Not a problem...
- No, no. It's okay.

631
00:45:28,732 --> 00:45:29,732
No, no. We're leaving.

632
00:45:29,811 --> 00:45:32,313
I know exactly how to handle
this situation.

633
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:34,609
Pop quiz hot-shot.

634
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:37,405
You just picked a fight
with a poorly disguised hedgehog

635
00:45:37,546 --> 00:45:40,385
who's seen way too many
action movies. What do you do?

636
00:45:40,507 --> 00:45:42,162
What do you do?

637
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:47,014
Am I crazy? It was supposed
to break, right?

638
00:45:48,783 --> 00:45:51,607
Break please. Break please.
Break please, bottle. Please.

639
00:45:51,776 --> 00:45:53,148
Sonic?

640
00:46:04,749 --> 00:46:07,353
- Nice going.
- Thanks. It's awesome, right?

641
00:46:07,522 --> 00:46:09,509
All right, who's next?
Who wants some?

642
00:46:09,688 --> 00:46:11,266
Who do I get to beat up?

643
00:46:11,661 --> 00:46:16,063
Hey, has anybody seen my waitress?
Still waiting on those buffalo wings.

644
00:46:16,955 --> 00:46:18,445
Ah, you!

645
00:46:29,925 --> 00:46:31,127
Really?

646
00:48:20,074 --> 00:48:22,841
- So, should we get out of here?
- Yeah, time to go.

647
00:48:25,005 --> 00:48:26,026
That was amazing!

648
00:48:26,229 --> 00:48:29,120
Wait a second, did we even pay
our tip? It doesn't matter!

649
00:48:29,303 --> 00:48:31,926
Watch this. Watch this.
I always wanted to do this.

650
00:48:35,180 --> 00:48:37,654
- Get them!
- See ya, suckers.

651
00:48:38,439 --> 00:48:41,007
I can't say for sure,
but I think they liked me.

652
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,469
- Yes! Yes!
- Yeah!

653
00:48:48,614 --> 00:48:49,245
Ouch!

654
00:48:49,398 --> 00:48:52,255
- They got you pretty good.
- I'm all right, have been hit harder.

655
00:48:52,413 --> 00:48:54,090
Did you see how much
toilet paper I used?

656
00:48:54,238 --> 00:48:57,750
The next person that goes into that
bathroom will have nothing to wipe with.

657
00:48:58,261 --> 00:49:01,921
The floors were sticky. The crowd
was rough. And the odds were against us.

658
00:49:02,159 --> 00:49:05,421
But there was no stopping
Donut Lord and the Blue Blur.

659
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:08,230
Scratch another one off my list.

660
00:49:09,449 --> 00:49:11,362
You are a weird little dude.

661
00:49:23,874 --> 00:49:26,178
- Okay.
- So, what are we gonna do now?

662
00:49:27,854 --> 00:49:29,914
I'm gonna pass out watching TV.

663
00:49:30,247 --> 00:49:32,735
- You should, too.
- But this is my last night on Earth.

664
00:49:32,867 --> 00:49:35,190
- I wanna soak up every last second.
- All right, well...

665
00:49:35,330 --> 00:49:38,552
Anything you can find to do in this room,
you knock yourself out.

666
00:49:45,116 --> 00:49:47,208
Good times.

667
00:49:49,507 --> 00:49:50,960
Oh, come on.

668
00:49:51,231 --> 00:49:55,293
- That's awful, what did you eat?
- I think it's called a chili dog.

669
00:49:55,985 --> 00:49:58,675
You might wanna check
your fur on that one, buddy.

670
00:49:59,223 --> 00:50:02,212
Hey, so what's this next planet
you're supposed to go to like?

671
00:50:02,465 --> 00:50:05,320
It's no Earth. I can tell you that.
There's no people.

672
00:50:05,456 --> 00:50:08,377
Just breathable air and giant
mushrooms, and stuff.

673
00:50:08,909 --> 00:50:10,622
Well, look at it this way.

674
00:50:11,001 --> 00:50:13,249
At least you won't be the only <i>fun-gi</i>.

675
00:50:13,905 --> 00:50:16,460
No, don't ever do that again.

676
00:50:17,598 --> 00:50:18,950
I liked it.

677
00:50:20,816 --> 00:50:22,807
I'm really gonna miss this place.

678
00:50:23,067 --> 00:50:26,622
I know I have to leave Earth to be safe,
but what if Longclaw was wrong?

679
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:29,915
Maybe I could have a life here.

680
00:50:34,588 --> 00:50:36,927
All right, we should get some sleep.

681
00:50:38,363 --> 00:50:41,519
You sleep, don't worry about me,
I'm gonna stay up all night

682
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,446
enjoying Earth while I can.

683
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,976
Sure, kid.

684
00:50:45,619 --> 00:50:47,763
As long as we're
on the road by eight.

685
00:51:11,657 --> 00:51:15,777
<i>Thomas Wachowski, accused of committing
an act of domestic terrorism.</i>

686
00:51:16,326 --> 00:51:18,974
<i>Wachowski is considered
armed and dangerous.</i>

687
00:51:19,237 --> 00:51:22,249
<i>Any information regarding
his whereabouts should be reported</i>

688
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:24,234
<i>to local authorities immediately.</i>

689
00:51:30,454 --> 00:51:32,408
Did he say where he was going?

690
00:51:35,481 --> 00:51:37,759
Maybe. Maybe not.

691
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:40,599
Like I'd ever tell you.

692
00:51:41,944 --> 00:51:43,503
Stand down, Agent Stone.

693
00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:46,043
This well-meaning citizen obviously
doesn't understand

694
00:51:46,196 --> 00:51:48,154
the urgency of the matter.

695
00:51:50,484 --> 00:51:51,945
Really?

696
00:51:54,203 --> 00:51:56,915
Now, that's what I call
'good cop, bad cop'.

697
00:51:59,922 --> 00:52:01,510
Left yourself open.

698
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:06,055
Judging by the quickest route
to San Francisco,

699
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:09,292
the approximate speed of their vehicle
and local weather conditions...

700
00:52:10,878 --> 00:52:12,455
They should be...

701
00:52:13,114 --> 00:52:15,053
right about...

702
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,434
here.

703
00:52:17,734 --> 00:52:20,964
- That's brilliant, Sir.
- Thanks... for nothing.

704
00:52:23,895 --> 00:52:26,373
- So, what's on your bucket list?
- Me?

705
00:52:26,507 --> 00:52:29,318
- Yeah, everyone has a bucket list, right?
- Well, sure, but...

706
00:52:29,454 --> 00:52:31,295
I mean, you are the one leaving Earth.

707
00:52:31,676 --> 00:52:33,665
And I'm not planning
on dying anytime soon.

708
00:52:33,812 --> 00:52:36,978
Don't be so sure, your best friend
is a magnet for danger.

709
00:52:37,117 --> 00:52:39,034
You're anointing yourself as the bestie?

710
00:52:40,224 --> 00:52:42,197
Little presumptuous,
but... I mean...

711
00:52:42,671 --> 00:52:44,821
I like you, of course, but...

712
00:52:45,050 --> 00:52:46,785
You know, we're not best friends.

713
00:52:47,153 --> 00:52:48,885
You tucked me in last night.

714
00:52:49,089 --> 00:52:52,178
- Fine, fine. Best animal friend.
- That would be my dog Ozzy.

715
00:52:52,287 --> 00:52:56,112
Okay, let's drop this increasingly
humiliating topic of conversation.

716
00:52:56,338 --> 00:52:58,124
Bucket list. Give it to me.

717
00:52:58,549 --> 00:53:00,491
Okay, there is one thing.

718
00:53:01,399 --> 00:53:03,320
In Green Hills I've always felt,

719
00:53:03,703 --> 00:53:06,874
I don't know, more like a baby sitter
than a real cop, you know?

720
00:53:07,062 --> 00:53:09,892
So, I want a chance to prove
myself under real pressure.

721
00:53:10,065 --> 00:53:12,830
I'm gonna move to San Francisco,
become a street cop.

722
00:53:13,445 --> 00:53:16,090
And, I don't know,
see if I have what it takes.

723
00:53:17,252 --> 00:53:18,471
What?

724
00:53:19,735 --> 00:53:23,260
- Why is your face doing that?
- You're leaving Green Hills?!

725
00:53:23,994 --> 00:53:25,982
- Okay.
- Bu... But... But why?

726
00:53:26,032 --> 00:53:29,093
- Why would you leave Green Hills?
- This maybe hard for you to understand,

727
00:53:29,232 --> 00:53:31,867
but Green Hills is a small town,
it's a very small town.

728
00:53:32,005 --> 00:53:34,467
It's not small. There are
hundreds of people.

729
00:53:34,626 --> 00:53:36,165
That's a small town, dude.

730
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:38,976
It's a perfect town,
and the people need you.

731
00:53:39,081 --> 00:53:42,427
Please, I clean up their gutters,
I jumpstart their cars in the winter.

732
00:53:42,563 --> 00:53:44,254
They can call anybody to do that.

733
00:53:44,377 --> 00:53:47,886
Sure, they can call anybody,
but they don't. They call you.

734
00:54:04,996 --> 00:54:07,128
Eeny meeny miny...

735
00:54:08,341 --> 00:54:09,722
mayhem.

736
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:22,914
- You're not making any sense.
- Would you calm down?

737
00:54:22,938 --> 00:54:24,976
You come from a great town
with great people,

738
00:54:25,126 --> 00:54:27,776
and by my count zero bad guys
trying to kill you.

739
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:32,505
Besides, what could possibly
be more important

740
00:54:32,645 --> 00:54:34,961
than protecting the people you care about?

741
00:54:40,997 --> 00:54:42,519
Look, I get...

742
00:54:44,337 --> 00:54:45,664
Yeah!

743
00:54:52,939 --> 00:54:56,614
You know what? I was wrong about you.
You're not the Donut Lord at all.

744
00:54:56,739 --> 00:54:58,597
You're more like the Jerk Lord.

745
00:54:58,746 --> 00:55:01,330
Have you noticed the harpoon
stuck in our dash?!

746
00:55:07,333 --> 00:55:08,333
Sonic!

747
00:55:08,363 --> 00:55:11,961
I was forced from my home,
your home is perfect and you're leaving it.

748
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:13,746
Why would you do that?

749
00:55:13,871 --> 00:55:16,201
- Your body!
- No, no! Not again!

750
00:55:16,437 --> 00:55:18,233
- Hey, hold on!
- Why?

751
00:55:18,353 --> 00:55:19,722
Because I'm gonna do this.

752
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:39,518
Sonic!

753
00:55:40,932 --> 00:55:42,343
Sonic!

754
00:55:46,445 --> 00:55:48,911
Guess I had a bonus life.

755
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:52,669
Yeah, baby!

756
00:55:52,868 --> 00:55:55,044
Sonic - one, big tank - zero.

757
00:55:55,374 --> 00:55:57,224
I'm sorry. Did we
get this on camera?

758
00:55:57,336 --> 00:55:59,706
- How are you not dead?
- I have no idea.

759
00:56:00,157 --> 00:56:01,495
But do you see me dancing?

760
00:56:01,648 --> 00:56:04,157
- Yes, I saw your dance.
- Is that all you've got?

761
00:56:04,303 --> 00:56:06,241
No, but thank you for asking.

762
00:56:09,961 --> 00:56:11,060
Sonic!

763
00:56:11,512 --> 00:56:14,106
- Get back in the truck!
- You go, I'll catch up.

764
00:56:25,293 --> 00:56:27,569
I think that tank just had a baby.

765
00:56:40,156 --> 00:56:41,590
Incoming!

766
00:56:43,708 --> 00:56:46,316
- It's my turn!
- You just had one. It's mine!

767
00:56:46,479 --> 00:56:48,590
Hey, stop fighting, or I'm taking
that thing away!

768
00:56:48,771 --> 00:56:49,921
Yeah, right, Dad.

769
00:57:01,827 --> 00:57:03,819
- Where are you going?
- Just drive the car.

770
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:05,502
I'll take care of this.

771
00:57:05,691 --> 00:57:07,556
And if I don't make it, just ditch me,

772
00:57:07,698 --> 00:57:09,074
you seem good at that.

773
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:20,749
Hey, everyone, welcome back
to my livestream.

774
00:57:20,867 --> 00:57:23,095
Today, we're destroying robots. Step one.

775
00:57:28,277 --> 00:57:29,844
Yes! We did it!

776
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:37,100
We did not do it. Who is this guy?

777
00:57:37,511 --> 00:57:39,680
Ever wonder where your
tax dollars are going?

778
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:42,173
My turn, here,
just keep us going straight.

779
00:57:42,528 --> 00:57:43,872
I put on cruise control.

780
00:57:44,126 --> 00:57:47,763
I feel just like Vin Diesel.
It's all about family, Tom.

781
00:57:54,942 --> 00:57:58,731
Quick suggestion. Roll up into a ball
and smash him with your body.

782
00:57:59,968 --> 00:58:02,312
Whoa! Where'd you learn how to drive?!

783
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:05,031
Here, in this truck,
it's happening as we speak.

784
00:58:08,044 --> 00:58:09,964
I can't reach it, bring it in closer.

785
00:58:10,099 --> 00:58:12,471
- What?
- Bring it in closer. Hit the brakes.

786
00:58:12,724 --> 00:58:15,656
- Oh, you mean this one?
- The other brakes!

787
00:58:30,053 --> 00:58:33,221
Give me a big fat break!

788
00:58:39,271 --> 00:58:41,305
This one is cute, let's keep him.

789
00:58:44,907 --> 00:58:46,020
Oh, come on!

790
00:58:46,154 --> 00:58:48,476
How can something so adorable
be so terrible.

791
00:58:51,810 --> 00:58:53,704
You got car insurance, right?

792
00:59:00,091 --> 00:59:01,525
Buzz off!

793
00:59:01,911 --> 00:59:04,597
- That doesn't sound good.
- No, beeping means bad! Get rid of it!

794
00:59:04,711 --> 00:59:05,439
I'm trying.

795
00:59:05,558 --> 00:59:07,532
Just throw it off the window!
Throw it anywhere!

796
00:59:07,659 --> 00:59:10,018
- I can't get it off!
- All right, I'm pulling over.

797
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:19,426
- Did I get it?
- No.

798
00:59:21,218 --> 00:59:22,788
Here, hold still.

799
00:59:23,541 --> 00:59:25,322
It's going. It's going.

800
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:26,926
It's still here.

801
00:59:30,072 --> 00:59:33,291
Get off me! Nailed it!

802
00:59:42,958 --> 00:59:44,285
Sonic!

803
00:59:51,418 --> 00:59:52,635
No, no.

804
00:59:59,654 --> 01:00:01,379
Hey, come on. You're all right.

805
01:00:01,522 --> 01:00:03,689
Wake up. Wake up.

806
01:00:10,425 --> 01:00:11,831
Did we get them?

807
01:00:12,552 --> 01:00:14,430
Oh, no, there they are.

808
01:00:14,698 --> 01:00:17,435
They are real survivors, those two.

809
01:00:22,368 --> 01:00:24,164
Can we have a moment?

810
01:00:26,598 --> 01:00:28,630
Pin yourself to the wall.

811
01:00:29,566 --> 01:00:31,784
You know, I won't miss you
when you're gone.

812
01:00:31,909 --> 01:00:35,849
Human beings are unreliable and stupid,
and I care very little about them.

813
01:00:35,986 --> 01:00:38,323
But my machines are diligent, relentless.

814
01:00:38,531 --> 01:00:40,478
They're everything to me!

815
01:00:54,977 --> 01:00:56,551
<i>Interesting.</i>

816
01:01:18,322 --> 01:01:20,919
Hold on, buddy. You'll be all right.

817
01:01:21,391 --> 01:01:22,775
You'll be all right.

818
01:01:27,554 --> 01:01:30,506
- I beg you, Rachel. No. It's an emergency.
- No, no. Not today. Goodbye. Bye bye.

819
01:01:30,530 --> 01:01:32,513
- Would you stop? Open it please. Maddie!
- Bye. Bye.

820
01:01:32,537 --> 01:01:35,777
- Don't do this to me please. It's important.
- Tom! Oh my God. Rachel let him in!

821
01:01:35,832 --> 01:01:38,596
I am calling the Police. No, I am calling
the FBI. I am calling the CIA.

822
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,148
- I am calling someone.
- Don't do that.

823
01:01:40,172 --> 01:01:41,812
- I'm calling your Mother.
- Okay. Got it.

824
01:01:41,847 --> 01:01:43,643
- Maddie, can we just...
- Tom, what's going on?

825
01:01:43,667 --> 01:01:45,877
You're all over the news.
I've been trying to call you.

826
01:01:45,901 --> 01:01:47,864
I had to ditch my phone
so they couldn't track me.

827
01:01:47,888 --> 01:01:49,128
- Ditch his phone?
- Track? You?

828
01:01:49,238 --> 01:01:50,924
- Uncle Tommy!
- Jojo! Hey.

829
01:01:51,054 --> 01:01:54,235
- Now your niece is an accessory to treason.
- She's not.

830
01:01:54,435 --> 01:01:57,541
- Would you calm down.
- Calm down? I will not calm down!

831
01:01:57,693 --> 01:02:01,045
Yes, calm down. Stop talking.
No, Ozzy, please. I know, good to see you.

832
01:02:01,251 --> 01:02:04,130
- No, no! Ozzy, stop!
- Oh, good ol' Lord Baby Jesus!

833
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:07,070
What is that, Tom?
Is it plutonium? Is it emails?

834
01:02:07,195 --> 01:02:10,586
Yes, it's plutonium. Can we just please...
Can we just go to your room and talk...

835
01:02:10,610 --> 01:02:11,710
Stop it, Ozzy! Quit it!

836
01:02:11,850 --> 01:02:14,368
- This is why I told you he was no good.
- I'm not engaging...

837
01:02:14,656 --> 01:02:16,238
- No, Ozzy, quit it!
- Door now open.

838
01:02:16,366 --> 01:02:17,526
- Locked.
- No, it's unlocked.

839
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:19,954
Ozzy, no! Ozzy! No, no!

840
01:02:21,646 --> 01:02:23,084
Oh, catch me, Jojo.

841
01:02:25,148 --> 01:02:26,822
Oh, thank God!

842
01:02:28,084 --> 01:02:29,349
Can I get a glass of water?

843
01:04:10,526 --> 01:04:14,006
I just thought you might like a latte
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

844
01:04:14,461 --> 01:04:17,807
What do I look like, an imbecile?
Of course, I want a latte!

845
01:04:18,027 --> 01:04:19,946
I love the way you make them!

846
01:04:26,485 --> 01:04:28,903
Ready the prototype.

847
01:04:29,413 --> 01:04:34,838
With this kind of power my machines
can finally reach their full potential.

848
01:04:41,242 --> 01:04:43,098
He's gonna be okay, Jojo.

849
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:46,840
Oh, thank God.
He's gonna be okay, right?

850
01:04:47,137 --> 01:04:49,874
I'm a vet, Tom, I don't even know
what I'm looking at here.

851
01:04:50,004 --> 01:04:51,963
Well, he's a hedgehog...
Or so he says.

852
01:04:52,168 --> 01:04:53,857
- It talks?
- Almost constantly.

853
01:04:54,162 --> 01:04:55,179
Okay.

854
01:04:56,937 --> 01:04:58,021
- Holy...
- What?

855
01:04:58,196 --> 01:04:59,816
Its pulse is super fast.

856
01:04:59,958 --> 01:05:02,077
Well, that actually
might be normal for him.

857
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:05,433
- I don't know. You gotta help him, Maddie.
- I don't know his physiology.

858
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:08,486
He doesn't seem to have
any broken bones. He's just...

859
01:05:09,371 --> 01:05:10,911
really banged up.

860
01:05:12,209 --> 01:05:14,176
Look at his poor little feet.

861
01:05:17,785 --> 01:05:20,381
Hang in there, buddy.
You're gonna be all right.

862
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:26,247
Jojo, untie your Mo... Jojo!

863
01:05:26,674 --> 01:05:29,284
Untie Mommy. Sweetie.

864
01:05:29,987 --> 01:05:31,110
Jojo!

865
01:05:34,001 --> 01:05:35,619
I have to go to the bathroom.

866
01:05:35,766 --> 01:05:37,459
He's gonna be okay, right?

867
01:05:37,608 --> 01:05:40,139
Like he's gonna snap outta this.
He'll wake up soon.

868
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,656
Oh, smelling salts! Don't you have
like vet smelling salts,

869
01:05:42,778 --> 01:05:45,006
like for cats, or parakeets or something?

870
01:05:45,156 --> 01:05:48,074
- No, they don't make cat smelling salts.
- They should.

871
01:05:48,504 --> 01:05:52,583
I have human smelling salts
in my human first aid kit.

872
01:05:53,864 --> 01:05:55,113
Okay.

873
01:05:57,312 --> 01:05:58,460
Come on, buddy.

874
01:05:58,607 --> 01:05:59,939
Gotta go fast!

875
01:06:03,356 --> 01:06:05,715
Where am I? What year is it?
Is the Rock President?

876
01:06:05,841 --> 01:06:07,787
Whoa, whoa, buddy.
You're okay. Calm down.

877
01:06:07,923 --> 01:06:10,129
- Oh, hi Pretzel Lady!
- Hi.

878
01:06:11,051 --> 01:06:12,051
Tom?

879
01:06:12,222 --> 01:06:14,004
- Yeah?
- Can I talk to you please?

880
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:19,217
Space hedgehog, stay there. Try to rest.

881
01:06:19,339 --> 01:06:22,531
You got it. I am great at resting.
I rest better than anybody.

882
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,305
Still talking.

883
01:06:24,433 --> 01:06:28,070
First of all, can we take a moment to
acknowledge how under control I've been.

884
01:06:28,185 --> 01:06:29,548
- Amazing.
- Didn't freak out.

885
01:06:29,665 --> 01:06:31,525
- No.
- Totally calm.

886
01:06:31,933 --> 01:06:33,477
Thank you.

887
01:06:34,195 --> 01:06:35,885
Second of all,

888
01:06:36,398 --> 01:06:39,341
what the heck is going on?!
Is that thing an alien?

889
01:06:39,497 --> 01:06:43,903
Okay, so, remember how Crazy Carl
is always going on about the Blue Devil?

890
01:06:44,782 --> 01:06:46,897
- That's him. He's real?
- Dah!

891
01:06:47,021 --> 01:06:49,492
What is he doing here?
What are you doing here?

892
01:06:50,633 --> 01:06:53,787
I kinda sorta shot our little blue friend
with your tranq gun.

893
01:06:53,912 --> 01:06:56,215
- No, you did not!
- I didn't... I didn't mean to.

894
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:58,386
Okay, this is kinda hard
for me to explain.

895
01:06:58,451 --> 01:07:00,187
And it's gonna sound a little bit crazy.

896
01:07:00,313 --> 01:07:03,663
He has to get to the Transamerica
building, and I promised I'd take him.

897
01:07:04,992 --> 01:07:06,127
Aliens?

898
01:07:06,392 --> 01:07:08,401
Maddie, your husband's
lost his mind.

899
01:07:08,548 --> 01:07:12,154
You can use this as an opportunity
to leave him. No one would judge you.

900
01:07:17,159 --> 01:07:19,537
So you won't hurt your feet anymore.

901
01:07:20,035 --> 01:07:21,393
Really?

902
01:07:22,362 --> 01:07:24,675
No one's ever given me a gift before.

903
01:07:25,484 --> 01:07:27,685
I gotta check that off my bucket list.

904
01:07:37,065 --> 01:07:38,986
All right. Lookin' good.

905
01:07:42,109 --> 01:07:43,269
Okay.

906
01:07:43,529 --> 01:07:46,430
You said you wanted to help
people in real trouble, right?

907
01:07:46,905 --> 01:07:48,280
Well, that's what you're doing.

908
01:07:48,475 --> 01:07:51,979
Blue alien hedgehogs
still count as <i>people,</i> right?

909
01:07:52,137 --> 01:07:53,393
- I think so, too.
- Yeah.

910
01:07:53,522 --> 01:07:55,038
- I think.
- Okay.

911
01:07:55,198 --> 01:07:58,888
I love you. Did I tell you that already?
I don't deserve you, you know that?

912
01:07:59,077 --> 01:08:00,624
I know that.

913
01:08:03,118 --> 01:08:04,118
So,

914
01:08:04,206 --> 01:08:07,790
you're supposed to be Tom's best friend
that he won't shut up about.

915
01:08:09,375 --> 01:08:11,201
Well, I don't see the appeal.

916
01:08:12,984 --> 01:08:15,677
Stop. That is very gross.

917
01:08:17,793 --> 01:08:18,848
- Hey.
- Hey.

918
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,059
So,

919
01:08:20,192 --> 01:08:22,317
my truck still runs,
but it's pretty much totaled.

920
01:08:22,436 --> 01:08:24,636
You think your sister would mind
if we borrowed her car?

921
01:08:24,761 --> 01:08:26,553
You have got to be kidding me!

922
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:29,508
- She'll be fine.
- Yes, let's do that.

923
01:08:29,853 --> 01:08:32,045
This is my house!

924
01:08:34,435 --> 01:08:37,729
Whoa, whoa... Now this is my turn.
And I pull around him.

925
01:08:37,877 --> 01:08:40,390
Sorry. And... perfect park.

926
01:08:40,691 --> 01:08:43,411
- What are you, crazy?
- Is there anything you didn't hit?

927
01:08:43,548 --> 01:08:46,301
- Why did we let the alien drive?
- Hey, I got us here.

928
01:08:46,465 --> 01:08:48,375
And please, five stars.

929
01:08:49,567 --> 01:08:50,927
So, this is it?

930
01:08:51,113 --> 01:08:52,760
That's it. That's your pyramid.

931
01:08:53,295 --> 01:08:56,362
- Wow! Look at that thing.
- What happens now?

932
01:08:57,268 --> 01:08:59,838
- Oh, he's... gone.
- Yup.

933
01:09:01,090 --> 01:09:03,798
No good. You need a special key
to get to the roof.

934
01:09:04,779 --> 01:09:06,355
What now?

935
01:09:06,518 --> 01:09:09,710
Time for me to abuse the power
entrusted to me.

936
01:09:19,568 --> 01:09:20,942
We got a jumper on the roof.

937
01:09:21,064 --> 01:09:24,393
Gotta get up there fast, or we're gonna
have a human pancake on our hands.

938
01:09:24,564 --> 01:09:26,870
You came all the way from Montana?

939
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,346
Yup, that's how serious it is.

940
01:09:33,786 --> 01:09:35,128
Okay.

941
01:09:36,547 --> 01:09:38,163
You just saved a life.

942
01:09:41,627 --> 01:09:42,987
Come on. Come on.

943
01:09:46,804 --> 01:09:49,453
How much longer?
I can't breathe in here.

944
01:09:51,629 --> 01:09:53,919
Hello? Anybody there?

945
01:09:54,083 --> 01:09:56,037
Do you have your child in that bag?

946
01:09:56,268 --> 01:09:57,411
No.

947
01:09:57,578 --> 01:10:00,025
I mean yes, it's a child,
but it's not mine.

948
01:10:01,147 --> 01:10:02,524
It's not your child?

949
01:10:02,888 --> 01:10:04,919
Relax, I'm a cop, okay?

950
01:10:05,041 --> 01:10:06,872
Plus he likes it in there,
don't you, buddy?

951
01:10:07,009 --> 01:10:08,306
Why would I like it in here?

952
01:10:08,446 --> 01:10:11,332
This is worse than the dog cage
you had me in earlier.

953
01:10:12,043 --> 01:10:13,785
Such a kidder.

954
01:10:14,791 --> 01:10:16,207
Okay.

955
01:10:16,318 --> 01:10:18,958
No, I'm scared of the dark!
Is anybody there?

956
01:10:32,148 --> 01:10:34,259
What were you keeping in this bag?

957
01:10:34,492 --> 01:10:36,222
A jar of pickled farts?

958
01:10:36,381 --> 01:10:38,665
All right, all right,
what are we looking for?

959
01:10:41,215 --> 01:10:42,493
This!

960
01:10:42,954 --> 01:10:45,082
Okay, what happens now?

961
01:10:45,192 --> 01:10:48,604
Now, all I have to do is think of where
I want the other end of the ring to appear,

962
01:10:48,734 --> 01:10:50,426
- and I throw it.
- So, that's it?

963
01:10:50,802 --> 01:10:52,729
- We did it?
- Yeah. We did it.

964
01:10:53,455 --> 01:10:56,944
Hey, sorry we didn't get to do
everything on your bucket list, pal.

965
01:10:57,108 --> 01:10:59,940
It's okay. I did the ones
I needed the most.

966
01:11:00,866 --> 01:11:04,564
- You two are so cute, like...
- Oh, please. What?

967
01:11:04,704 --> 01:11:06,746
- We are not.
- No, we're not cute.

968
01:11:06,886 --> 01:11:10,017
We are a couple of loose cannons
just living by our own rules.

969
01:11:10,141 --> 01:11:11,681
- Exactly. Yeah.
- Really?

970
01:11:11,824 --> 01:11:14,980
And our rules include expressing
heartfelt emotions.

971
01:11:15,131 --> 01:11:16,308
If you say so.

972
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:18,045
Okay then.

973
01:11:18,328 --> 01:11:19,378
All right.

974
01:11:20,454 --> 01:11:22,454
- You gotta go, right?
- Yeah, I gotta go, so...

975
01:11:22,571 --> 01:11:25,743
- I gotta go. We gotta go, too.
- So, see... All right. Bye bye.

976
01:11:29,939 --> 01:11:31,571
Just one more thing.

977
01:11:39,648 --> 01:11:41,783
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

978
01:11:44,225 --> 01:11:47,052
I know it's a tough decision
for you to leave Green Hills.

979
01:11:47,420 --> 01:11:50,125
Walking away from something
you care about

980
01:11:50,595 --> 01:11:52,282
has to be painful.

981
01:11:52,416 --> 01:11:54,457
You're not sure you really wanna go, huh?

982
01:11:55,294 --> 01:11:58,199
I don't wanna go, but I can't stay.

983
01:11:58,738 --> 01:12:01,509
As long as I'm here
I put everyone in danger.

984
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,375
I can't do that.

985
01:12:04,316 --> 01:12:07,034
I just want you to know
that these last two days

986
01:12:07,168 --> 01:12:10,917
have been the best two days of my life.

987
01:12:13,984 --> 01:12:15,655
You know I never though I'd say this

988
01:12:15,787 --> 01:12:18,297
but I'm actually gonna miss you,
you little Blue Devil.

989
01:12:18,444 --> 01:12:20,490
I'll miss you too, Donut Lord.

990
01:12:21,323 --> 01:12:22,480
Thank you.

991
01:12:23,191 --> 01:12:24,471
For what?

992
01:12:25,101 --> 01:12:26,682
For saving my life.

993
01:12:44,672 --> 01:12:47,573
Okay, did someone leave
their 'Find my Phone' on?

994
01:13:13,874 --> 01:13:16,935
Welcome to San Francisco, Mr. Wachowski.

995
01:13:17,619 --> 01:13:19,454
Are you enjoying the clam chowder?

996
01:13:19,568 --> 01:13:21,988
It's the government wack job
who keeps trying to kill us,

997
01:13:22,103 --> 01:13:23,103
unsuccessfully.

998
01:13:23,338 --> 01:13:25,416
Nice of you to swing by
on your way to Comic-Con.

999
01:13:25,548 --> 01:13:27,044
Yeah, what are you wearing?

1000
01:13:28,576 --> 01:13:30,052
It's a flight suit.

1001
01:13:30,232 --> 01:13:32,895
Designed to modulate my body temperature
and reduce drag.

1002
01:13:33,124 --> 01:13:35,019
Yeah, and yet you're still are one.

1003
01:13:35,435 --> 01:13:38,287
Good one, you are catching fire, Thomas.

1004
01:13:38,668 --> 01:13:41,573
Oh, and speaking of heat,
I see you've taken a lover.

1005
01:13:41,716 --> 01:13:45,277
Does she have a name, or should
we just call her 'collateral damage'?

1006
01:13:45,486 --> 01:13:46,698
Hey, watch your mouth!

1007
01:13:46,842 --> 01:13:49,269
Unless you want a little more
of what I gave you earlier?

1008
01:13:49,393 --> 01:13:50,474
Punched him in the face.

1009
01:13:50,591 --> 01:13:52,965
Oh, you punched him right in the face.
It was awesome.

1010
01:13:53,102 --> 01:13:56,001
The time for talking is over!
It's time to push buttons.

1011
01:13:56,134 --> 01:13:58,965
Your flying eggs are pretty impressive,
Mr. Eggman.

1012
01:13:59,197 --> 01:14:01,627
But let's face it, you'll never catch me.

1013
01:14:01,766 --> 01:14:03,293
Confidence,

1014
01:14:03,570 --> 01:14:05,859
a fool's substitute for intelligence.

1015
01:14:13,334 --> 01:14:15,014
That's not good.

1016
01:14:15,408 --> 01:14:18,607
Sonic, I know you got the super speed
and everything, but Maddie and I...

1017
01:14:18,730 --> 01:14:20,877
Totally defenseless,
probably gonna get blown up?

1018
01:14:20,998 --> 01:14:22,321
Pretty much, yeah.

1019
01:14:22,876 --> 01:14:25,600
Don't worry, I know exactly what to do.

1020
01:14:32,796 --> 01:14:34,778
I was not expecting that.

1021
01:14:35,058 --> 01:14:38,199
But I was expecting not to expect
something, so it doesn't count.

1022
01:15:38,557 --> 01:15:39,809
Come on!

1023
01:15:39,937 --> 01:15:42,133
Com... Com... Come on! Come on!

1024
01:16:08,605 --> 01:16:11,080
Hi Tom. Glad you're here.

1025
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:14,430
Could use some help.
Old Bessie is about to give birth.

1026
01:16:15,096 --> 01:16:16,444
Give me a minute.

1027
01:16:19,156 --> 01:16:22,265
Can I give you one
genius piece of advice?

1028
01:16:22,856 --> 01:16:24,268
Don't run.

1029
01:16:24,408 --> 01:16:26,550
It'll only hurt more if you do.

1030
01:16:26,770 --> 01:16:29,146
And it's bad for your joints,
they proved it.

1031
01:16:29,289 --> 01:16:33,023
All right, Eggman, you wanna get fast?
Let's get fast.

1032
01:16:36,004 --> 01:16:37,925
The hard way it is.

1033
01:16:56,651 --> 01:16:58,952
That was an illegal left, by the way.

1034
01:17:01,219 --> 01:17:03,041
<i>So, here we are again.</i>

1035
01:17:03,183 --> 01:17:04,909
<i>We've been through so much together.</i>

1036
01:17:05,026 --> 01:17:07,550
<i>Now you understand
why there's a psychotic robot-doctor</i>

1037
01:17:07,681 --> 01:17:09,912
<i>chasing a super sonic blue hedgehog.</i>

1038
01:17:09,998 --> 01:17:11,260
<i>Wanna know how it ends?</i>

1039
01:17:11,410 --> 01:17:12,864
<i>Yeah, me too.</i>

1040
01:17:30,287 --> 01:17:33,695
How is this possible?! No one's ever
caught up to me before.

1041
01:17:41,470 --> 01:17:42,959
Coming through!

1042
01:17:43,753 --> 01:17:45,053
Sacre bleu!

1043
01:17:45,916 --> 01:17:47,878
<i>Excusez-moi, monsieur.</i>

1044
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,340
Here we go. Room to open it up.

1045
01:18:03,336 --> 01:18:04,848
I can't lose him!

1046
01:18:19,184 --> 01:18:21,760
If you can't beat him, blind him.

1047
01:18:24,758 --> 01:18:26,850
Lost visual contact.

1048
01:18:31,595 --> 01:18:33,642
You're not allowed up there!

1049
01:18:33,803 --> 01:18:35,939
It's one of the Seven Wonders.

1050
01:18:59,871 --> 01:19:02,158
- Get out of here!
- Go! Go!

1051
01:19:09,415 --> 01:19:12,440
You're an astonishing little creature.

1052
01:19:15,102 --> 01:19:17,104
It'll be fun to take you back to the lab

1053
01:19:17,260 --> 01:19:19,825
for a litany of invasive
exploratory procedures.

1054
01:19:20,467 --> 01:19:22,771
Any last words?

1055
01:19:22,968 --> 01:19:24,382
Guac.

1056
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:26,268
I like that word.

1057
01:19:27,198 --> 01:19:29,667
I don't have to tell you
how many scientific breakthroughs

1058
01:19:29,800 --> 01:19:32,170
have been made possible
by animal testing.

1059
01:19:32,294 --> 01:19:33,645
You're being very selfish.

1060
01:19:33,786 --> 01:19:35,623
- Going my way?
- What the...

1061
01:19:41,216 --> 01:19:43,383
Who the hell do you think you are?!

1062
01:19:46,466 --> 01:19:48,454
I'm the Donut Lord, you son of a...

1063
01:19:53,048 --> 01:19:55,179
Autopilot, adjust.

1064
01:19:55,626 --> 01:19:56,787
Why?

1065
01:19:57,168 --> 01:20:00,358
Why would you throw
your life away for this <i>thing</i>?

1066
01:20:00,514 --> 01:20:02,057
That's why I don't have friends.

1067
01:20:02,215 --> 01:20:04,220
Next thing you know, you're
somebody's best man,

1068
01:20:04,367 --> 01:20:06,097
they wanna have
the wedding out of town.

1069
01:20:06,236 --> 01:20:08,320
Like nobody has
anything better to do!

1070
01:20:08,528 --> 01:20:10,552
Anyway, where were we?

1071
01:20:10,748 --> 01:20:11,858
Oh, yes,

1072
01:20:12,028 --> 01:20:13,765
you were about to die.

1073
01:20:15,691 --> 01:20:17,825
That's our Sheriff you're messing with.

1074
01:20:19,139 --> 01:20:20,818
And our Blue Devil?

1075
01:20:20,982 --> 01:20:24,012
Who as everyone can see
is a very real creature,

1076
01:20:24,396 --> 01:20:27,365
and not at all invented by me!

1077
01:20:29,539 --> 01:20:31,509
- Be careful.
- Just... pull it away...

1078
01:20:31,659 --> 01:20:32,848
Tom.

1079
01:20:46,147 --> 01:20:48,458
I don't mean to be indelicate here.

1080
01:20:48,824 --> 01:20:51,859
But someone should get some ice
to keep the body fresh.

1081
01:20:54,602 --> 01:20:57,251
He's just a silly little alien.

1082
01:20:57,487 --> 01:20:59,437
He didn't belong here!

1083
01:21:00,969 --> 01:21:02,539
That little alien

1084
01:21:03,168 --> 01:21:06,570
knew more about being human
than you ever will.

1085
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:09,238
His name was Sonic.

1086
01:21:09,604 --> 01:21:11,416
This was his home.

1087
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:13,892
And he was my friend.

1088
01:21:38,549 --> 01:21:40,185
He's all yours.

1089
01:21:41,451 --> 01:21:42,864
Everyone get back!

1090
01:21:46,354 --> 01:21:49,242
I think you have something
that belongs to me.

1091
01:21:59,954 --> 01:22:01,865
This is my power!

1092
01:22:02,053 --> 01:22:04,466
And I'm not using it
to run away anymore.

1093
01:22:04,647 --> 01:22:07,912
I'm using it to protect my friends!

1094
01:23:06,443 --> 01:23:07,791
Now you've done it!

1095
01:23:07,956 --> 01:23:10,655
Guess what, Eggman,
I'm not leaving Earth.

1096
01:23:10,826 --> 01:23:12,195
You are!

1097
01:23:12,333 --> 01:23:13,684
Donut Lord?

1098
01:24:02,540 --> 01:24:05,296
- Told you you got this.
- Hey, we got this.

1099
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,557
- These belong to you.
- Thank you very much.

1100
01:24:21,395 --> 01:24:23,419
No more pushing people of the buildings.

1101
01:24:23,584 --> 01:24:25,209
You know I can't promise that.

1102
01:24:28,287 --> 01:24:31,389
- You did pretty good, space hog.
- Thanks, Donut Lord.

1103
01:24:31,538 --> 01:24:34,365
You're gonna have to explain
this 'Donut Lord' thing.

1104
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:37,071
Nope, sorry, that's for me
and the little guy. Right?

1105
01:24:37,370 --> 01:24:39,515
We got our thing, you got
your thing with your...

1106
01:24:39,634 --> 01:24:41,252
- sister.
- Oh my God, my sister.

1107
01:24:41,419 --> 01:24:43,751
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

1108
01:24:45,502 --> 01:24:47,561
Jojo, put on my Fitbit.

1109
01:24:48,357 --> 01:24:50,175
Then I can at least get some steps.

1110
01:24:50,329 --> 01:24:52,158
We can never go back there.

1111
01:24:53,036 --> 01:24:54,568
I mean, are we?

1112
01:24:56,599 --> 01:24:58,976
'Cause it kinda feels like
we're home right now.

1113
01:24:59,481 --> 01:25:01,190
Really?

1114
01:25:02,360 --> 01:25:04,885
I kinda feel like I checked
the 'save a life'

1115
01:25:05,053 --> 01:25:06,904
box off my bucket list.

1116
01:25:09,337 --> 01:25:13,086
Now all I wanna do is to spend my life
with the people I care about.

1117
01:25:14,555 --> 01:25:16,611
I wanna check that box.

1118
01:25:17,064 --> 01:25:18,976
Okay. I like that.

1119
01:25:19,249 --> 01:25:21,807
All right, everybody. Nothing to see here.

1120
01:25:22,345 --> 01:25:25,014
Disperse. Just another
ordinary day in Green Hills.

1121
01:25:25,165 --> 01:25:26,988
Carl, I'll take that chainsaw.

1122
01:25:27,284 --> 01:25:29,070
Come on, let's go!

1123
01:25:29,262 --> 01:25:31,427
You act like you've never seen
a fight between

1124
01:25:31,580 --> 01:25:35,532
an intergalactic space rodent
and a robot with a doctorate.

1125
01:25:44,672 --> 01:25:46,134
You got enough there?

1126
01:25:46,403 --> 01:25:48,464
- Yes, Mr. Manager.
- You need any more?

1127
01:25:48,693 --> 01:25:50,016
Get that...

1128
01:26:00,682 --> 01:26:02,679
Mr. And Mrs. Wachowski?

1129
01:26:03,347 --> 01:26:04,690
Yes?

1130
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:08,844
A token of appreciation
from your government.

1131
01:26:09,011 --> 01:26:12,309
For keeping quiet about recent
incidents, which never occurred.

1132
01:26:14,381 --> 01:26:15,650
Wow!

1133
01:26:16,030 --> 01:26:18,548
- Wonder what it is.
- Money to fix the house?

1134
01:26:18,713 --> 01:26:20,966
- Letter from the President?
- You'll see.

1135
01:26:21,408 --> 01:26:22,898
Okay.

1136
01:26:25,806 --> 01:26:28,018
- Olive Garden?
- Yeah.

1137
01:26:28,306 --> 01:26:29,844
The way you said "you'll see"

1138
01:26:30,008 --> 01:26:32,574
made me think it was something
better than the things we said.

1139
01:26:32,717 --> 01:26:34,930
Have you tried their
'Never Ending Pasta Bowl'?

1140
01:26:35,157 --> 01:26:36,787
It never ends.

1141
01:26:37,009 --> 01:26:38,735
That sounds fancy.

1142
01:26:38,941 --> 01:26:41,695
Well, thank you.
We appreciate the gesture.

1143
01:26:42,326 --> 01:26:45,466
Oh, hey, I guess we can close
the file on that Robotnik guy, huh?

1144
01:26:45,634 --> 01:26:47,022
Just disappeared?

1145
01:26:47,181 --> 01:26:51,058
I'm sorry, but, no such person exists,
or ever has existed.

1146
01:26:52,297 --> 01:26:53,487
I wish that were true.

1147
01:26:53,653 --> 01:26:55,511
You haven't by any chance been in contact

1148
01:26:55,654 --> 01:26:58,226
with a certain alien creature
since the incident, have you?

1149
01:26:58,398 --> 01:27:00,290
Uncle Sam would love
to have a chat with him.

1150
01:27:00,473 --> 01:27:02,852
Very casual, brunch perhaps.

1151
01:27:04,439 --> 01:27:07,466
Oh, you mean the little blue guy?
No, no. Nothing.

1152
01:27:08,473 --> 01:27:10,651
Doubt we'll ever hear from him again.

1153
01:27:12,016 --> 01:27:14,198
- Very well.
- Okay.

1154
01:27:14,693 --> 01:27:16,535
- Thank you.
- Great.

1155
01:27:18,765 --> 01:27:20,066
Yup.

1156
01:27:23,290 --> 01:27:25,988
To be honest, I'm pretty pumped
about the pasta bowl.

1157
01:27:26,512 --> 01:27:28,380
So, you guys wanna watch a movie or what?

1158
01:27:28,515 --> 01:27:31,760
Sorry, buddy, it's a school night,
it's time for you to go back to your cave.

1159
01:27:31,879 --> 01:27:33,489
What? It's three in the afternoon!

1160
01:27:33,623 --> 01:27:35,552
You know how you get
when you're tired, come on.

1161
01:27:35,675 --> 01:27:37,157
Me? I'm not like anything.

1162
01:27:37,297 --> 01:27:40,317
- You guys are so uncool.
- Yeah, yeah. We know.

1163
01:27:40,946 --> 01:27:44,242
- Hey, buddy, where are you going?
- You said I have to go back to my cave.

1164
01:27:44,378 --> 01:27:45,560
We did.

1165
01:28:01,134 --> 01:28:03,339
Oh my... Are you kidding me?

1166
01:28:04,219 --> 01:28:05,863
I can't believe it.

1167
01:28:06,175 --> 01:28:07,411
How did you...

1168
01:28:08,108 --> 01:28:10,377
It... This is... It's all here.

1169
01:28:20,620 --> 01:28:23,699
Look at this! Are you kidding?
And the bean bag? No way!

1170
01:28:24,465 --> 01:28:27,059
How did you even get this?
How did you get it all over?

1171
01:28:28,049 --> 01:28:29,932
I love it, I love it!

1172
01:28:33,479 --> 01:28:36,219
Well, welcome home.

1173
01:28:36,455 --> 01:28:38,932
Thank you so much.

1174
01:28:47,767 --> 01:28:49,247
Oh, no, you don't.

1175
01:28:49,413 --> 01:28:52,425
No second best animal friends
allowed in my room.

1176
01:28:52,924 --> 01:28:55,197
Wait, what are you doing?
Stay away from me.

1177
01:28:55,610 --> 01:28:58,304
Stop it. I'm warning you,
I've got nunchucks.

1178
01:28:58,483 --> 01:29:01,006
Hey, stop. Okay, you can stay.

1179
01:29:18,335 --> 01:29:21,683
My grasp on sanity remains absolute.

1180
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:25,334
Isn't that right, Agent Stone?

1181
01:29:30,129 --> 01:29:32,446
Why don't you get a head start.

1182
01:29:34,363 --> 01:29:36,667
Do some rockconnaissance.

1183
01:29:37,584 --> 01:29:40,324
Rockconnaissance.
Come on, that's hilarious.

1184
01:29:40,481 --> 01:29:42,297
What's the matter with you?!

1185
01:29:42,613 --> 01:29:45,951
Here's the sitch. Uninhabited planet.

1186
01:29:47,300 --> 01:29:49,562
No resources. No supplies.

1187
01:29:49,826 --> 01:29:51,643
No apparent way home.

1188
01:29:53,727 --> 01:29:55,996
A lesser man would die here.

1189
01:29:58,564 --> 01:30:00,792
I'll be home by Christmas.

1190
01:30:19,728 --> 01:30:22,204
Rockconnaissance!

1191
01:30:25,025 --> 01:30:26,849
Come on, cheer up!

1192
01:30:27,170 --> 01:30:31,000
There is a post-credits scene
at 01:32:18! Stay tuned.

1193
01:32:28,980 --> 01:32:31,413
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

1194
01:32:31,576 --> 01:32:32,896
I found him!

1195
01:32:33,032 --> 01:32:34,811
I just hope I'm not too late.
