1
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,860
所以  我知道你们在想什么
So... I know what you're thinking.

2
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,200
为什么这个巨帅的刺猬
Why is that incredibly handsome hedgehog

3
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,560
会被一个南北战争时期来的疯狂胡子男追
being chased by a mad man with a mustache from the civil war?

4
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:33,550
老实说  感觉就像我一生都在奔跑
Gotta be honest, it feels like I've been running my whole life.

5
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:36,230
信息量太大了吗  我说得太快了吗
Is this too much? Am I going too fast?

6
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,430
这像是我做的  这样吧  我们往回倒
It's kinda what I do. You know what? Let's back up.

7
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:49,880
这座岛是我的家乡
This is the island where I am from.

8
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:54,530
岛上什么都有  沙滩  瀑布
It had everything: sandy beaches, cascading waterfalls,

9
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,640
每个人都能玩的大回环
public access to loop-de-loops.

10
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:58,630
我从来不需要坐校车
And I never had to catch a school bus

11
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,160
因为我能在两秒内
because I can run across the entire island

12
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,650
跑遍整个岛
in less than two seconds.

13
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,610
而且也没有学校
Also, there was no school.

14
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:07,240
我知道  这是个很不错的岛  对吧
I know, pretty sweet island, right?

15
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:10,930
我生来就具有超能力
I was born with extraordinary powers,

16
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:12,590
他们让我隐藏这些能力
and was told to keep them in secret.

17
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:15,840
和其他孩子一样  我做了完全相反的事
And like any kid, I did the exact opposite.

18
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:20,570
这是长爪鸟  她照顾我
That's Longclaw, she took care of me.

19
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,050
欧比王·肯诺比《星球大战》中卢克的导师和安纳金的师傅
她基本上就是欧比王·肯诺比
She was basically Obi-Wan Kenobi,

20
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,270
如果欧比王·肯诺比长鸟嘴并吃老鼠的话
if Obi-Wan Kenobi had a beak and ate mice.
欧比王·肯诺比《星球大战》中卢克的导师和安纳金的师傅

21
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:27,660
索尼克  有人可能会看到你
Sonic, someone could've seen you!

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,630
没人看见我  我跑得太快了
No one saw me. I am too fast!

23
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,170
我想把这个送给你
And, I wanted to bring you this.

24
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:38,110
趴下
Get down!

25
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,070
事实证明  超能力
Turns out with great power

26
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,190
总会招来渴望得到超能力的坏蛋
comes great power-hungry bad guys.

27
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,710
而我把他们引来了
And I let them right to us.

28
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,890
仔细听我说  索尼克
Listen carefully, Sonic.

29
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:07,460
你有一种我从未见过的能力
You have a power unlike anything I've ever seen.

30
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:10,150
这意味着总有人想得到它
And that means someone will always want it.

31
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:14,350
唯一保持安全的办法就是躲起来
The only way to stay safe is to stay hidden.

32
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:20,240
这个星球在宇宙的最远处
This world is on the farthest side of the universe.

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,340
你在那里会安全的
You should be safe there.

34
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,160
-你不走我也不走  -你必须走
- I don't wanna go without you! - You must!

35
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,380
这些戒指将是你最重要的财产
These rings will be your most important possession.

36
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,440
如果你被发现了  就用一个
If you ever discovered, use one.

37
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:36,500
永远不要停止奔跑
Never stop running.

38
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,480
现在  快走
Now go!

39
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:43,680
长爪鸟
Longclaw!

40
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,830
-再见  索尼克  -不要
- Goodbye, Sonic. - No!

41
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:50,210
不要
No!

42
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,100
刺猬索尼克
刺猬索尼克

43
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,660

46
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,250
拜托  一辆车都没有吗
Come on, one car?

47
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,620
好无聊
I'm bored.

48
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,430
汤姆  能听到我说话吗  你在吗
Tom, do you read me? Are you there?

49
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,110
不  韦德  我在巴巴多斯的一艘游艇上
No, Wade, I'm actually on a yacht in Barbados

50
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,180
和蕾哈娜在一起
with Rihanna.

51
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:40,400
天啊  太了厉害了  请发照片

No, Wade, I'm at the speed trap.

已经在那里了吗  你怎么回来得这么快
Already? How did you get back so fast?

54
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,190
巴巴多斯在海上
Barbados is in the ocean.

55
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:48,480
稍等  我想我发现了什么
Hang on, I think I got something.

56
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:57,600
伙计  这么着急干嘛
Hey, buddy, where's the fire?

57
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:00,090
这附近住着孩子
We've got kids living around here.

58
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,500
这挺有趣的  抱歉
It was kinda funny, sorry.

59
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:11,000
什么
What?

60
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,890
汤姆  我们需要你到中央大街来

人口  1981人  海拔3445英尺

64
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,230
开玩笑的  有只狗偷了个面包圈
Just kidding, a dog stole a bagel.

65
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,410
但他们确实需要支援
But they do need it back.

66
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,300
伙计  你刚才差点被撞死
Buddy, you almost got yourself killed out there.

67
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,430
你是谁  某些玩的就是心跳党吗
What are you, some kind of an adrenaline junkie?

68
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,650
一直这么慢肯定很难过吧
Must be rough being slow all the time.

69
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:22,330
知道吗  今天是你的幸运日
I'll tell you what, today is your lucky day.

70
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:28,830
你以前感到过如此有活力吗
Have you ever felt so alive?

71
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:32,400
真棒  你做得太好了
This is great, you're doing amazing.

72
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,260
天啊

73
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,090
挽救成功
Good recovery!

74
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:41,790
保守这个小秘密  好吗
Let's keep this our little secret, okay?

75
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:45,000
你从没见过我  我从没来过这里
You never saw me. I was never here.

76
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,300
所以  你之前在期待些什么
So, what were you expecting?

77
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:03,250
一只肮脏的小刺猬吃着浆果
A dirty little hedgehog eating berries,

78
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:05,020
挣扎着活下去吗
and struggling to survive?

79
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:06,050
再想想
Think again,

80
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,690
因为我在地球上过着最好的生活
because I am living my best life on Earth.

81
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:11,450
我有座图书馆
I've got a library.

82
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,620
一个家庭健身房
A home gym.

83
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,200
还有最先进的安保系统
And a state of the art security system.

84
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:26,440
下个出口
山顶路

85
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,590
不会吧
Oh, no!

86
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,700
如果我被发现了  我会按长爪鸟告诉我的
And if I ever discovered, I'll follow Longclaw's instructions,

87
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,160

安全的世界

89
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:37,870
用我的戒指逃去一个新的星球
and use my rings to escape to a new planet.
安全的世界

90
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,360
安全的世界

91
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:39,830
一个只有蘑菇的  美丽安全的小星球
A nice, safe little world filled only with mushrooms.

92
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,910
一个只有蘑菇的  美丽安全的小星球

93
00:07:43,730 --> 00:07:46,590
令人恶心的  臭臭的蘑菇
Gross, smelly mushrooms...

94
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,330
我讨厌蘑菇
I hate mushrooms.

95
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,600
但不要担心这些
But let's not worry about all of that.

96
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:55,310
这里是青山镇
This is Green Hills.

97
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,720
地球上最棒的地方
The greatest place on Earth.

98
00:07:58,790 --> 00:08:01,480
这些是我的朋友  在那里  我觉得
These are my people, and there, I say,

99
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,620
我是他们可爱的太空生物
I am their lovable space creature.

100
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:06,230
所以如果他们不知道我的存在会怎样
So what if they don't know I exist?

101
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:10,540
我最喜欢的人是甜甜圈殿下
My favorite person is the Donut Lord.

102
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:13,480
他保护这个镇
Protector of this town,

103
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,020
是所有大小生物的保护者
and defender of all creatures, big and small.

104
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,780
早上好  唐纳德  黛西  达菲.

她对动物超级友善
She is super nice to animals,

107
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:28,630
奇怪的是她天生特别柔软
and strangely was born without bones.

108
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,490
镇上有个人实际上已经发现了我
There is one person in town who's actually onto me.

109
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,710
他称我为蓝恶魔

110

我昨晚差点就抓住他了

111

118
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:00,100
生死时速

太好了  基努  你就是国宝
Yes! Keanu, you are a national treasure.

122
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:07,400
公交车上有枚炸弹
There's a bomb on the bus.

123
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:10,780
"快问快答"  真是经典台词
"Pop quiz, hot-shot." The classic line.

124
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,760
基本上  我们就像是一家人
Basically, we're like a family,

125
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:15,860
尽管我们从未见过面
even though we haven't met yet.

126
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,130
你不觉得长期一个人
You don't think your prolonged isolation

127
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:18,140
治疗中
请勿打扰
精神科医生
A. 伯德特医生
你不觉得长期一个人
You don't think your prolonged isolation

128

你不觉得长期一个人
You don't think your prolonged isolation

129
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,820
可能会让你变的有点神经吗
is making you a bit crazy perhaps?

130
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,640
发疯  我吗  不可能  医生
Crazy? Me? No way, Doc.

131
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:25,430
你误会我了
You got me all wrong.

132
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:28,550
尽管你有这些所谓的朋友
And despite all these so called friends of yours,

133
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:31,750
但在内心深处你还是非常孤独  对吗
deep down you are still rather lonely?

134
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:40,730
也许你害怕自己会永远一个人
Perhaps afraid you'll be alone forever?

135
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,380
不  别吃垃圾
Hey! No, no...

136
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:02,710
快走  快点  快  走开
Get out of there! Come on! Oh, come on! Get out of there!

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,290
这是什么
What's that?

143
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:20,410
是我认为的那个东西吗
Is that what I think it is?

144

对  拆开吧

这一切发生得太快了

00:11:44,690 --> 00:11:46,680
我打了第二份工来付房租

打了第三份工来付我的学费

179
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,730
亲爱的  你确定你愿意这样做吗
Babe, are you sure you're okay with this?

180
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:58,880
瓦查斯基家族的成员
I mean, there's been a Wachowski

181
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:01,760
保护这个小镇已经有五十年多了
protecting this town for more than 50 years.

182
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,760
这是个巨大的改变
This is a big change.

183
00:12:05,270 --> 00:12:06,890
我愿意
I'm positive.

184
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,230
到了我离开这里证明自己的时候了
It's time for this guy to get out there and prove himself.

185
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,220
我爱青山镇  但是
I love Green Hills, but...

186
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,660
我希望帮助那些真正有困难人
You know, I wanna help people in real trouble.

187
00:12:15,020 --> 00:12:17,780
我希望有人在生死关头向我求助
I want someone to turn to me in a life-or-death situation,

188
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,500
而我会尽力帮他们
and I'll be there for them.

189
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:24,270
-我明白了  我以你为荣  -谢谢
- I get it. I'm so proud of you. - Thank you.

190
00:12:25,950 --> 00:12:27,240
怀着沉重的心情
And so it is with a heavy heart,

191
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,330
我向你们宣布  我已接受了
that I tell you all that I've accepted a position

192
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:33,110
旧金山警察局的工作  立即生效
at the San Francisco Police Department, effective immediately.

193
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,600
离开我的家乡和我所有的朋友会很艰难
It's gonna be tough to leave my hometown, and all my friendships.

194
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,950
但我觉得有些事我必须去做
But this is something I feel like I need to do,

195
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:45,270
作为警官和男人  我需要成长
to grow, as both an officer, and a man.

196
00:12:48,690 --> 00:12:50,590
你觉得怎么样  彩针巡佐
What do you think, Sergeant Sprinkles?

197
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,120
说得不赖  对吧
That wasn't so bad, right?

198
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:56,260
我现在要做的就是
Now all I gotta do is...

199
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,870
告诉除甜甜圈以外的所有人
tell everyone who isn't a donut.

200
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,410
是季后赛
Whoa, the play-offs.

201
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:08,240
得分
主场
客场
安打/失误
出局
好球
坏球

202
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,850
真酷
So cool.

203
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,520
第九局下半场  平分
Bottom of the ninth, tie score.

204
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:57,650
接下来的比赛中
And exactly who you want at the plate

205
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,280
你希望跑垒员是谁  是索尼克
with the game on the line, Sonic.

206
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,350
但在投手区盯着他的
But staring him down from the pitcher's mound

207
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,770
是青山镇最可怕的左撇子  也是索尼克
is the most fearsome southpaw in Green Hills, also Sonic.

208
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,300
好了  集中注意力  索尼克
Okay, focus, Sonic.

209
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:08,260
如果赢了这场比赛
If you win this game

210
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:11,040
你就是青山镇最受欢迎的孩子
you'll be the most beloved kid in Green Hills.

211
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,640
把球打到左边的那个家伙那里
Hit it to the guy in left,

212
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,580
他真的很蠢
he's a real space case.

213
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,450
我真受不了那个家伙
I can't with that guy.

214
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:24,980
击球手索尼克  击球手索尼克
Hey, batter Sonic, hey, batter Sonic,

215
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:27,750
专注的击球手索尼克
is so in batter Sonic.

216
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,630
我来接  我来接
I got it, I got it...

217
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,310
我没接到
I don't got it.

218
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,950
回本垒  回本垒
Go home! Go home!

219
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,970
来吧
Come on!

220
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:58,390
安全上垒
Safe!

221
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,850
太好了  我做到了
Yes! Yes! I did it!

222
00:15:02,990 --> 00:15:05,700
你看到了吗  我做到了  做到了
Did you see that? I did it! I did it.

223
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,920
我真的只是一个人
I really am alone.

224
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,080
永远只有我自己
All alone. Forever.

225
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,370
我敢肯定  没人注意到
I'm sure no one noticed

226
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,380
那个蓝色的大爆炸  对吧
that giant blue explosion, right?

227
00:16:10,050 --> 00:16:11,380
Wade

228
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:12,760
喂  韦德
Hey, Wade.

229
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,890
你好  汤姆  我是韦德
Hi, Tom. Wade here.

230
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,170
发生什么事了
What is going on?

231
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:19,700
-天啊  我想停电了  -对  蠢货
- Oh Gosh, I think the power is out. - Yap, dur.

232
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:22,350
灯全熄了  全镇人都吓坏了
The lights are out. The whole town is freaking out.

233
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,440
-我该怎么办  -好吧  放松
- What should I do? - Okay. Relax.

234
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,410
深呼吸  给吉尔打电话
Take a deep breath, call Gil,

235
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,860
看看他们是否能找到下游线路  然后
see if they can locate the down line, then...

236
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,360
给齐姆打电话  看他能否把他的发电机
call Zim, and see if he can get his generator over

237
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,740
送去超级线索咖啡  这样食物就能保持新鲜
to the Super Cue, so the food stays fresh.

238
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:37,530
先打给齐姆  再给吉尔打吗
Call Zim before Gil?

239
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:39,580
-打给吉尔  喂  -等会回给你
- Call Gil... Hello? I'll call you back.

240
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,950
等等  别挂  就这么挂掉了吗
Wait. Wait! Hello? Was that the end of the instructions?

241
00:16:44,010 --> 00:16:46,670
行  好的  你能做到的
Okay. All right. You can do this.

242
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:50,730
他说首先要干什么来着
What was the first thing he said to do?

243
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:54,370
好吧  放松
Right. Relax.

244
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,030
二十分钟前  一次能量震荡
Twenty minutes ago an energy surge

245
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:19,990
让整个太平洋西北地区全面停电
knocked our power across the entire Pacific Northwest.

246
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:20,300
对此我们了解些什么
What do we know?

247
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,860
我们的第一反应是  这是电磁脉冲炸弹
Our first instinct was it was an EMP.

248
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:26,360
但电磁脉冲没有那么大的能量
But electromagnetic pulses don't have that kind of power.

249
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,670
美国宇航局已排除
NASA has ruled out

250
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,000
流星撞击或太阳耀斑的可能性
meteor strikes or solar flares.

251
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,070
能源部说不是电厂故障
The Department of Energy says it's not a power plant malfunction.

252
00:17:32,170 --> 00:17:35,000
听上去我们很擅长弄明白它不是什么
Sounds like we're really good at figuring out what it wasn't.

253
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,220
这可能是更大规模攻击的前奏
This could be a prelude to a larger attack.

254
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:39,300
我建议抽调第五团和第六团
I'm suggesting we scramble the fifth and sixth regiment.

255
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,580
不不不
No, no...

256
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:43,020
这需要一个更复杂的头脑
This needs a much more sophisticated mind.

257
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,920
一个懂技术的人
Someone who understands technology.

258
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,140
你想派一个科学家
You wanna send in a lab rat?

259
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,760
不是随便一个科学家
Not just any lab rat.

260
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:49,090
一个真正厉害的科学家
A lab rat with teeth.

261
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,610
你说的不会是我想的那个人吧
You're not suggesting who I think you're suggesting.

262
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,630
-我知道他有些奇怪  -奇怪
- I know he's a little weird... - Weird?

263
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:56,210
-不  不可能  -他是个变态
- No, no. No way! - He's a psychological tire fire.

264
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:59,650
但他相当聪明  5个博士学位  智商超高
But he's also brilliant. Five PhDs. IQ off the charts.

265
00:17:59,810 --> 00:18:02,430
他的无人机技术是革命性的
And his drone tech is revolutionary.

266
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,450
你确定他可以处理吗
You're sure he can handle this?

267
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:06,310
他有完美的实操经历
He has a perfect operations record.

268
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:08,520
-还记得巴基斯坦的政变吗  -不记得
- Remember the coup in Pakistan? - No.

269
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,030
或者阿塞拜疆斯坦的起义
Or the uprising in Azerbaijanistan?

270
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,380
那根本就不是个国家
It's not even a country.

271
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:14,500
没错  为此你应该感谢罗伯特尼克
Exactly. And you can thank Robotnik for that.

272
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,900
不敢相信你竟然让那个怪人参与进来
I can't believe you're bringing that freak into this.

273
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,540
我也不敢相信  但是
Neither can I, but...

274
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,480
我们别无选择
We have no choice.

275
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:32,090
伙子们  快过来
Guys, coming up!

276
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:35,050
好的  长官
Yes, Major.

277
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,330
这是
What a...

278
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:12,160
是你负责这里吗
Are you in charge here?

279
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,700
-是的  -不  错了
- Yes, I am. - No. Wrong!

280
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,140
-名字  -我负责
- Name... - I'm in charge!

281
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:17,640
-我  -是少校
- Me! - Is Major...

282
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:19,770
-本  -我负责
- Ben... - I'm in charge.

283
00:19:20,870 --> 00:19:22,980
你之前没见过这种东西吧
You've never seen anything like this before?

284
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,740
它告诉我
It says I'm a top banana

285
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,560
我是一群饥饿猴子中的香蕉
in a world full of hungry little monkeys.

286
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,410
请允许我说明一下
Allow me to clarify.

287
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,810
在一个按重要性等级排列的
In a sequentially ranked hierarchy based on

288
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,920
层次结构中
level of critical importance

289
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,100
我们之间差距太大无法量化  斯通特工
the disparity between us is too vast to quantify. Agent Stone.

290
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,410
博士觉得你是最底层
The Doctor thinks you're basic.

291
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:39,880
我正在启动一个扫描序列
I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

292
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:42,610
每个方向十英里应该足够了
Ten miles in every direction should suffice.

293
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:45,540
-他还在用奇怪的眼神看我吗  -是的
- Is he still looking at me funny? - Yes, he is.

294
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:47,810
让他不要这么看我  否则我去查他的记录
Tell him to stop or I'll pull out his search history.

295
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:48,880
假如你还这么看着他
If you don't stop looking, the Doctor,

296
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,520
他会仔细看看你的
he'll take a closer look...

297
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,740
-我没聋  -告诉他现在他的人都向我报告
- I'm not deaf. - And tell him his men report to me now.

298
00:19:54,550 --> 00:19:57,350
打扰一下  我不知道你是否意识到
Excuse me? Listen, pal, I don't know if you realize...

299
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,160
对不起  少校  你叫什么
I'm sorry, Major, what was your name?

300
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:02,750
-本宁  -没有人关心
- Benning... - Nobody cares! Nobody cares.

301
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:05,250
听好  没人关心少校
Listen, Major Nobodycares.

302
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,540
你知道为什么没人关心你是谁吗
You know why nobody cares who you are?

303
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:10,560
因为没人关心你的一点点成就
Because nobody cares about your feeble accomplishments.

304
00:20:10,690 --> 00:20:13,170
没人关心你妈妈因为你读三年级
And nobody cares about how proud your Mommy is

305
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,750
有多骄傲
that you're now reading at a third grade level.

306
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:17,790
你看完《夏洛特的网》了吗
Have you finished 'Charlotte's Web' yet?

307
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,250
剧透警告  她最终死了
Spoiler alert, she dies in the end.

308
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:23,230
但她留下了一个瘆人的卵囊
But she leaves a big creepy egg sac.

309
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,990
我的宝贝们
Oh, my babies.

310
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,120
看看我的卵囊里出来了什么
Look what came out of my egg sac.

311
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:32,390
你知道我喜欢机器哪一点吗
You know what I love about machines?

312
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:36,450
它们遵循程序  让它们干什么就干什么
They do what they're told. They follow their programming.

313
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,720
它们不需要休假去喝酒
They don't need time-off to get drunk,

314
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,210
或者划船
and put the boat in the water.

315
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:42,550
我让你做什么你就做什么
And you do what you're told.

316
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:45,180
站在那边深渊的边缘
Stand over there on the edge of your personal abyss.

317
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,680
看着我的机器做你们工作
And watch my machines do your job.

318
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,110
你感受到了吗  斯通
Can you feel it, Stone?

319
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:53,900
我感受到了  博士
I can feel it, Doctor.

320
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:55,890
这是革命  斯通
It's evolution, Stone.

321
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,050
这是革命
It's evolution!

322
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:15,720
扫描

323
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,160
数据异常

324
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,390
初始化
光谱分析

325
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:21,980
完成
初始化
光谱分析

326
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:23,230
初始化
矿物成分

327
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,410
-斯通特工  -博士
- Agent Stone? - Doctor.

328
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:39,070
你在这张图像里有看到任何有用的信息吗
Do you see anything useful in this image?

329
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:42,380
-没有  博士  -你当然看不出来
- Nothing at all, Doctor. - Of course you don't.

330
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,700
你的眼睛没有被美国本土暗影狼
Your eyes weren't expertly trained to spot tracks

331
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:47,130
专业训练来发现痕迹
by the Native American Shadow Wolves.

332
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,790
太厉害了
That's extraordinary.

333
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,160
不  厉害的是
No, what extraordinary is...

334
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,320
我确定了这个生物准确的身高体重
I determined the exact height, weight,

335
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:05,000
和脊柱弯曲度
and spinal curvature of this creature.

336
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:08,020
但我的电脑不能在地球上的任何生物中
And my computer can't find a single match for it, anywhere

337
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:10,600
找到与之匹配的
in Earth's animal kingdom.

338
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,400
这次断电不是恐怖袭击
This blackout was not a terrorist attack,

339
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,190
那个也不是婴儿大脚怪
and that's no baby Bigfoot.

340
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:22,240
这个是完全不同的一种东西
This guy is something else entirely.

341
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,410
让所有搜寻部队都去寻找脚印
Divert all search units to the site of the footprint.

342
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:28,440
这是人类的一小步
That's one small step for man,

343
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,930
却是我的一大步
one giant leap for me.

344
00:22:42,260 --> 00:22:44,210
没事  没事  一切都好
Okay, okay. Everything is fine.

345
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:46,420
你玩了一会儿棒球  有一些沮丧
You played some baseball, got a little upset.

346
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:49,830
发出了一道闪电  现在他们来找你了
Lightning shut out of your butt, and now they're coming for you.

347
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,520
好吧  好吧  地球不再安全了
All right, all right. Earth isn't safe anymore.

348
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:55,480
该用方案B了  蘑菇村  我得拿上东西
Time for plan B - Mushroomville. I gotta take my stuff.

349
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,470
只带重要物品
Okay, essential items only.

350
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:00,370
牙刷  牙膏  发胶  夜灯  滑稽的帽子
Okay, toothbrush, toothpaste, hair gel, night light, funny hat.

351
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:03,620
吃了一半的哈密瓜  和香味蜡烛
This half-eaten cantaloupe, and my scented candle.

352
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:05,600
我所有的漫画书收藏
My entire comic book collection.

353
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,540
豆袋椅  豆袋椅能放进背包里吗
Bean bag chair, can a bean bag chair fit in the backpack?

354
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,000
不不  当然不行  太愚蠢了
No, no. Of course not. That's stupid.

355
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:13,420
还有什么  戒指  戒指  当然
Okay, what else? The rings! The rings, yes, of course!

356
00:23:14,770 --> 00:23:18,120
开始吧  戒指穿越  蘑菇星球我来了
Here we go. Ring time. Mushroom planet, here I come.

357
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,820
不好了  他们就在外面  我得去其他地方
Oh, no! They're right outside, I gotta go somewhere else.

358
00:23:26,620 --> 00:23:28,450
再见  山洞
Goodbye, cave.

359
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:33,960
-嗨  -嘿
- Hi. - Hey.

360
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:35,170
你在干什么
What are you doing?

361
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:38,050
与乔乔和雷切尔一起画画
Just coloring with Jojo and Rachel.

362
00:23:38,410 --> 00:23:40,060
听上去有一点有趣
That sounds half-fun.

363
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:42,520
这儿有有趣的事情  我们断电了
Hey, exciting stuff here. We had a power outage.

364
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,480
整个城镇都黑了
The whole town went dark.

365
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,770
像是一个信号告诉我要离开道奇
It was like a sign telling me to get outta Dodge.

366
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,780
-韦德肯定疯了  -是啊
- Wade must've lost his mind. - Yeah.

367
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:50,930
他也没什么别的本事
And he does not have much to lose.

368
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:53,750
你姐姐怎么样  她有没有劝说你离开我
How's your sister? Does she convince you to leave me yet?

369
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,200
没有  但她让我检查你手机上的交友软件
No, but she did tell me to check your phone for dating apps.

370
00:23:57,350 --> 00:23:59,780
我手机上的软件都是自带的
The only apps on my phone are the ones that came with it.

371
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,300
-以及橄榄园  -因为你在那
- And the Olive Garden. - Ah, because when you're there...

372
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,220
一个可以定位寻找餐厅和订餐的软件
-以及橄榄园  -因为你在那
- And the Olive Garden. - Ah, because when you're there...

373
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,000
你的家人
You're family.

374
00:24:05,620 --> 00:24:07,320
不是吧
No way!

375
00:24:09,830 --> 00:24:13,070
浣熊又来了  他们会看到惊喜
The racoons are back. And they are in for a surprise.

376
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,150
你的惊喜最好不是镇定剂枪
Your surprise better not be my tranquilizer gun.

377
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,580
他们只是饿了
They're just hungry.

378
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,310
再说  那是对付熊的
And also, that's for bears.

379
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,240
-很好  我知道它会管用的  -汤姆
- Good, now I know it'll work. - Tom!

380
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,790
开玩笑的  我只是用这个吓它们
I'm kidding, I'm just gonna use it to scare them.

381
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:27,460
-可能会致死  爱你亲爱的  再见  -汤
- Possibly to death. Love you, honey, bye. - To...

382
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,730
D i v o r c e[离婚]
D-i-v-o-r-c-e.

383
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:37,880
好吧  我进来了
Okay, I'm in.

384
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,680
对甜甜圈殿下的财产造成最小的损失
With minimal damage to Donut Lord's property.

385
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,820
可以开始了
Here we go.

386
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,090
在地球上没有成功  没关系
Didn't work out on Earth, but that's okay.

387
00:24:44,390 --> 00:24:46,190
你会去一个安全的世界
You're going to a safe world.

388
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:48,180
一个全是蘑菇的安全的世界
A nice safe world full of mushrooms.

389
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:51,770
蘑菇将是你唯一的朋友
Mushrooms that will be your only friends.

390
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,820
听上去坏极了  我做不到
That sounds awful, I can't do this.

391
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,210
你一定要这么做  没有其他选择了
You have to do it, there's no other option.

392
00:24:58,190 --> 00:24:59,610
好吧
All right.

393
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,010
等待背景调查的旧金山警员  举起爪子
SFPD, pending background check. Paws in the air!

394
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,370
旧金山
San Francisco?

395
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,610
仅在紧急时用

396
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:44,020
不
No.

397
00:25:48,570 --> 00:25:49,780
什么情况
What?

398
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:14,180
蓝恶魔
The Blue Devil.

399
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,030
-甜甜圈殿下  -你可以说话
- Donut Lord? - You can talk?

400
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,260
你不是
You're not...

401
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:34,430
-你不是来绑架我的吧  -你绑架了我
- You're not here to abduct me, are you? - You abducted me!

402
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,960
好吧  有道理  你是什么
Okay, it's a fair point. What are you?

403
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:39,890
为什么藏在我的车库里
Why are you hiding out in my garage?

404
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:41,230
我需要一个安全的地方
I needed somewhere safe,

405
00:26:41,370 --> 00:26:43,910
你是我唯一能够想到的人  甜甜圈殿下
and you are the only person I could think of, Donut Lord.

406
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:44,920
你为什么叫我甜甜圈殿下
Why do you keep calling me Donut Lord?

407
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,800
因为你和甜甜圈说话
'Cause you talk to donuts,

408
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,840
假如它们不守规矩就把它们吃掉
and then eat them if they get out of the line.

409
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,260
-好吧  有理  -等等  蘑菇都去哪里了
- Again, fair. - Wait... Where are all the mushrooms?

410
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,060
我为什么还在地球上  我
Why am I still on Earth? What did...

411
00:26:54,060 --> 00:26:55,910
糟糕  我戒指丢了
Oh, no, I lost my rings!

412
00:26:56,030 --> 00:26:57,430
什么
What?

413
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,290
发生了什么  是你们的母舰吗
What's happening? Is this your mothership?

414
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:08,930
-我没心情被探测  -你担心了
- I'm not in the mood to get probed. - You think you're worried?

415
00:27:09,050 --> 00:27:10,690
我连裤子都没穿
I'm not even wearing pants.

416
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,570
什么鬼
What the...

417
00:27:16,970 --> 00:27:19,220
-他们来抓我了  -谁来抓你
- They're coming for me! - Who's coming for you?

418
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:20,770
这跟我有什么关系
What does that have to do with me?

419
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,250
我没时间解释
I don't have time to explain,

420
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:24,780
-但你必须要帮助我  -我不  为什么
- but you have to help me. - No, I don't. Why?

421
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:25,670
我的腿
Well, my legs,

422
00:27:25,670 --> 00:27:28,250
通常被归类为致命凶器
which normally would be classified as lethal weapons

423
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,570
现在感觉像面条一样软
feel like spaghetti.

424
00:27:29,670 --> 00:27:32,810
我需要你的帮忙  求求你  生死攸关
I need your help, please. It's life or death.

425
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:42,030
好吧  跟我走
Fine, come with me.

426
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,060
帮一下
Little help?

427
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:01,100
-待在这  别出声  -好计划  极好的计划
- All right, stay here. And be quiet. - Good plan, great plan.

428
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,990
我们怎么合作的这么好
How are we working so well together?

429
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,100
简直心有灵犀
Practically finishing each other sentences.

430
00:28:06,390 --> 00:28:07,550
好吧  再见
Okay, bye.

431
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,490
你好
Hello there.

432
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,740
我能帮你吗
Can I help you?

433
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:20,250
早上好  乡下的朋友
Good morning, my rural chum.

434
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,870
我
I'm...

435
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:24,620
来自电力公司  调查断电的事情
from the power company, investigating the blackout.

436
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:25,320
你不介意的话
If you don't mind

437
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,020
我想看看你房子里面的读数
I'd like to take a few readings inside your house?

438
00:28:28,150 --> 00:28:30,080
说实话  你真的是电力公司的吗
No kidding, you're from the power company?

439
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,360
你肯定知道我的朋友斯盆塞
You must know my buddy Spencer.

440
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:33,160
我们一起玩垒球
We play softball together.

441
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:35,940
斯盆塞  他人很好
Spence, he's a good man.

442
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:39,770
-是的  是的  请进  -很好
- Yeah, yeah... come on in! - Great.

443
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:42,210
去看你想要的读数吧  除了
Take all the readings you need. Except...

444
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:44,960
难道电力公司一般不都在房子外
Don't the power company usually take their readings

445
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,450
收集读数吗
from outside the house?

446
00:28:46,570 --> 00:28:48,840
那样即使你不在家也可以检查
That way they can check even if you're not home.

447
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,590
并且  我的朋友斯盆塞在煤气公司工作
Also, my buddy Spencer works for the gas company.

448
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,420
他是一个极限飞盘选手
And he's more of an ultimate Frisbee guy.

449
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,660
所以你是否想告诉我为什么
So, you wanna tell me why

450
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,270
你觉得我会傻到让你直接进到我的房子里
you think I'm dumb enough to just let you walk inside my house?

451
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:08,720
-对不起  您是  -瓦查斯基
- I'm sorry, Mr...? - Wachowski.

452
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,420
但大家都叫我汤姆
But everyone calls me Tom.

453
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,660
除了我的牙医  他叫我蒂姆
Except my dentist, he calls me Tim.

454
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:14,200
但他已经叫了这么久了
But it's gone on for so long now

455
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:16,260
我再纠正他就很会奇怪
that it would be just weird if I corrected him.

456
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:18,510
好吧  被牙医叫做蒂姆的汤姆
Well, Tom, whose dentist calls him Tim.

457
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:20,800
你应该注意到了整座城镇
You may have noticed that this entire town

458
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:22,690
都断电了
has been experiencing a power outage.

459
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:24,660
是的  没有电  注意到了
Yup, no lights, picked up on that.

460
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:26,730
20分钟前我检测到了一个能量脉冲
Twenty minutes ago I tracked an energy pulse

461
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:27,710
与造成破坏的那个
with the similar signature

462
00:29:27,710 --> 00:29:30,010
具有相似的特性
to the one that caused that disruption.

463
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,450
听着  你是
Listen, Mr...?

464
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:49,160
博士  罗伯特尼克博士
Doctor. Doctor Robotnik.

465
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,200
但我的牙医叫我罗伯
But my dentist calls me Rob.

466
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:55,580
听着  罗博茨基博士
Look, Doctor Robotskiz...

467
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:58,150
我知道你是为了很重要的事情来的
I'm sure what you're here for is very serious,

468
00:29:58,280 --> 00:30:01,090
但这对我不管用  你可以问镇上的任何人
but it's got nothing to do with me, you can ask anyone in town.

469
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:02,890
-每个人都认识我  -我相信
- Everyone knows me. - I bet they do.

470
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:05,450
我相信你在这个漂亮的加油站休息站
I'm sure you're hella popular with the Gibs and Merles

471
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:08,780
很受吉布斯  梅尔斯和比利  鲍勃们的欢迎
and Billy Bobs in this glorified gas station rest stop.

472
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,500
这可以追溯到斗牛
Which goes way back to the days of

473
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,160
和用陶罐演奏的时代
tipping cows and playing on a jug band.

474
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,850
也许某一天你会实现你的目标
And maybe some day you'll have achieved your goal

475
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,770
得到好市多的会员卡  或领养一只贵宾狗
of getting a Costco card, or adopting a Labradoodle.

476
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:23,450
但现实是
But the reality is,

477
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:27,200
在我学步之前就已经超越了
I surpassed everything you're ever going to do

478
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,980
你所能做的一切
before I was a toddler.

479
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,280
在我能造出婴儿食品的时候
I was spitting out formulas

480
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:34,700
你还在吃婴儿食品
while you were still spitting up formula.

481
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,400
-我是母乳喂养的  -很好
- I was breastfed, actually. - Nice.

482
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:39,850
你敢对我孤儿的脸这么说
Rub that in my orphan face.

483
00:30:40,070 --> 00:30:41,500
瓦查斯基先生
Mr. Wachowski,

484
00:30:41,510 --> 00:30:45,870
你熟悉美国法典904标题10文章104吗
are you familiar with US code 904, title 10, article 104?

485
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,040
-熟悉  -任何想要帮助
- Yeah... - Anyone, who attempts to aid

486
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:52,030
美国的敌人的人都会被处死
an enemy of the United States shall suffer death.

487
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
如果抓到你的人是我
And if I'm the one who catches you,

488
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:58,220
那你会更惨
it'll be even worse.

489
00:30:59,630 --> 00:31:01,080
比死还惨
Worse than death?

490
00:31:03,280 --> 00:31:05,000
好了  我是一个球  只是个普通的球
Okay, I'm a ball. Just a normal ball.

491
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,310
我样子圆鼓鼓的混在里面
I'm blending in like a bulge.

492
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:07,390
别说话了  不  你才别说话了
Stop talking. No, you stop talking.

493
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:08,230
安静一点  索尼克
Be quiet, Sonic.

494
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:09,310
你才要安静点呢  索尼克
You be quiet, Sonic!

495
00:31:10,110 --> 00:31:12,400
我真希望他们没用X光扫描我
Oh, I hope they aren't scanning me with X-Rays,

496
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:14,950
我的午餐吃得真不怎么样
I had kind of an embarrassing lunch.

497
00:31:22,460 --> 00:31:24,760
不要害怕  不要害怕  不要害怕
Don't freak out. Don't freak... Don't freak out.

498
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,910
不要害怕  不要害怕
Don't freak out. Don't freak out.

499
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:29,720
我真的好怕啊
I'm freaking out!

500
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:34,540
你为什么不在楼梯上铺一层地毯啊
Why don't you have your staircase carpeted?

501
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,030
相比于
Compared to...

502
00:31:38,810 --> 00:31:40,390
-管道老旧了  -对啊
- Old pipes. - Yeah.

503
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,130
可能只是房屋塌下来了
Probably just the house settling.

504
00:31:42,130 --> 00:31:43,180
这儿没什么好看的
Nothing to see here.

505
00:31:44,780 --> 00:31:46,050
喂
Hey!

506
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:52,650
听好了
Here's the thing.

507
00:31:54,390 --> 00:31:55,930
我从来没算错过
I'm never wrong.

508
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:59,010
凡事都有第一次的  对吧
Well, first time for everything, I guess.

509
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,360
想吃一点蛋糕吗
Would you like some cake?

510
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,990
我听说浣熊嘴巴是最干净的
I hear racoons have the cleanest mouths

511
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:03,700
相比于其他经常吃垃圾的动物
of any animal that routinely eats garbage.

512
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:17,720
看看这个
Look at that.

513
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:19,870
我是对的
I was right.

514
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:22,220
看这毫不惊讶的表情
Note the lack of surprise.

515
00:32:22,410 --> 00:32:24,140
我们要再来一次吗
Should we try this again?

516
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,570
我给你五秒钟的时间
I'm going to give you five seconds

517
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:38,400
告诉我它在哪儿
to tell me where it is.

518
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,400
五
Five.

519
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,490
我不知道你在说什么
I don't know what's you're talking about.

520
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:40,940
四
Four.

521
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:41,990
恶棍  我可是名警察
Hey, tough guy, I'm a cop.

522
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,280
你正在威胁一名警官
And you're threatening an Officer.

523
00:32:43,450 --> 00:32:44,240
我又怎能威胁一个
How can you threaten somebody

524
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,780
从来没存在过的人呢
who never existed?

525
00:32:45,030 --> 00:32:46,200
三
Three.

526
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,940
快点  动动你的脑子
Come on, rack your brain!

527
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,250
或许还有机会想些
You might be able to come up with

528
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:52,500
站不住脚的理由救你自己一命
some lame excuse to go on living.

529
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,460
二
In two...

530
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:55,250
一
One!

531
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,460
等等  别伤害他
Wait! Don't hurt him.

532
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:03,130
威胁 认证

533
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:13,700
它的火力太猛了吧
This feels excessive.

534
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,440
武器 重装

535
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,290
待在我后面
Stay behind me.

536
00:33:30,910 --> 00:33:32,000
瞄准

537
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:36,950
别担心  一切在我的掌控之中
Don't worry, I got it right where I want it.

538
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:40,760
你敢相信亚马逊要用
Can you believe Amazon is gonna

539
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,340
这些东西来运送包裹
deliver packages with these things?

540
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,200
这个计划糟透了  我当时在想什么啊
This was a horrible plan, what was I thinking?

541
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,500
我要吐出来了
I'm gonna puke!

542
00:33:56,140 --> 00:33:57,230
快来
Come on!

543
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,410
我们得离开这里
We gotta get out of here.

544
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,400
别跟我说你就这么点能耐
Don't tell me that's all you've got.

545
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,640
我才刚刚开始呢
I'm just getting started.

546
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,500
你想和我蓝小子再打上第二回合吗
Let me know if you wanna go round two with the blue.

547
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:25,490
博士
Doctor!

548
00:34:25,860 --> 00:34:26,940
你还好吗
Are you okay?

549
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:29,280
我刚看到一个人跑走了  然后我就想
I just saw a guy race outta here and thought...

550
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:30,840
想你应该把它们拦下来
That you should stop them?

551
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,500
张开嘴
Open your mouth,

552
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,730
然后说  你想你该去拦住他们
and say you thought that you should stop them.

553
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:39,040
没有  我想我或许该确定您的安危
No, I thought that maybe I should check to see if you're okay.

554
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:40,720
你知道什么事会困扰
You know what's hard about

555
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:42,070
世界上最聪明的人吗
being the smartest person in the world?

556
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,020
别的人看起来都很笨
Everyone else seems stupid.

557
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,100
对  说得好
Yes. Way to go.

558
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,790
你答对了
You got that one.

559
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,860
不管那个生物是什么
Whatever this creature is,

560
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,740
我们的任务就是得到它
it's our job to secure it,

561
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:55,420
消除它的力量  发现其力量之源
neutralize it, uncover the source of its power.

562
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,480
要是它敢反抗
And if it resists...

563
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,070
就把它剖解开
we take it apart,

564
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,090
一点  一点
piece by piece.

565
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,200
看看它这么做为了什么
See what makes it tick.

566
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,590
-斯通  -博士
- Stone. - Doctor.

567
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,400
打个电话给研究视错觉的人
Call Optical Illusions.

568
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:11,780
告诉他们我要副新的眼镜框
Tell them I need new frames.

569
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,030
他们知道我喜欢什么样的
They know what kind I like.

570
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:17,530
把那根刺也带上
And bring that quill.

571
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:19,400
是  博士
Yes, Doctor.

572
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,690
欢迎来到
青山镇
小镇子  大胸怀

573
00:35:22,690 --> 00:35:23,960
好了  伙计
All right, pal,

574
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,690
你现在得和我好好谈一谈了
You need to start talking right now.

575
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:28,180
你是谁  你是什么
Who are you? What are you?

576
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:30,690
我是一只刺猬  我觉得这显而易见
I'm a hedgehog, I feel like that's obvious.

577
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:33,460
-我现在麻烦大了  -你麻烦大了
- And I'm in big trouble. - You're in big trouble?

578
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,070
你又没有一拳打下那个
You're not the one who punched

579
00:35:35,070 --> 00:35:36,580
好像是政府派来的怪人
some sort of government weirdo back there.

580
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,940
你觉得你有麻烦  我的戒指丢了
You think you have problems? I lost my rings!

581
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,610
戒指  你在说什么啊
Rings? What are you talking about?

582
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:43,050
好吧  高级生物就是用戒指
Okay, rings are how all advanced cultures

583
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,300
在星球之间穿梭的
travel between worlds.

584
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:46,920
现在我的戒指却在一幢尖尖的建筑顶端
And now mine are on top of a pointy building

585
00:35:47,070 --> 00:35:49,840
我只在你的紧身衬衫上见过那建筑
I've only ever seen on your skin tight t-shirt.

586
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,360
所以  我希望你带我去旧金山
So, I'd like you to take me to San Francisco,

587
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:53,850
让我拿回戒指
so I can get back my rings

588
00:35:53,850 --> 00:35:55,700
然后用它穿梭去蘑菇星球
and use them to go to the Mushroom planet.

589
00:35:57,550 --> 00:35:59,890
-蘑菇星球  -对
- Mushroom planet? - Yes!

590
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:01,420
好的
Right.

591
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,820
好了  伙计  出去吧你
Okay, pal. Out you go.

592
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:07,870
对不起  什么
I'm sorry, what?

593
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:10,240
听着  这个时候我是不可能
Look, this is the worst possible time for me

594
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,890
给自己惹麻烦的  好吗
to get myself into trouble, okay?

595
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,120
你让我救你一命  我救了你
You asked me to save your life, I saved your life.

596
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:16,200
现在请你  去找你的戒指
Now please, go find your rings,

597
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,170
还有你的蘑菇星球
and your Mushroomland.

598
00:36:17,330 --> 00:36:19,450
我真希望能在医院的床上醒来
Hopefully I'm gonna wake up in the hospital bed,

599
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:20,770
然后医生来和我说
and the doctors gonna tell me

600
00:36:20,770 --> 00:36:22,110
我的结肠镜检查很成功
that my colonoscopy was a big success.

601
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:22,770
好吗  那么  再见吧
Okay? So, goodbye.

602
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:24,880
好吧  再见了
Okay, goodbye.

603
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,380
再见
Goodbye.

604
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,010
你为什么还不走啊
Why aren't you leaving?

605
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:31,680
我不知道旧金山在哪里
I don't know where San Francisco is.

606
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:32,820
-在西边  -西边
- It's West. - West?

607
00:36:32,930 --> 00:36:34,290
往前走  错不了的
Straight shot, can't miss it.

608
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:35,190
好吧  好极了
Fine. That's cool.

609
00:36:35,330 --> 00:36:37,370
现在我就能大大方方说再见了
I'm totally cool saying goodbye now.

610
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:46,130
当我一头扎进太平洋阴冷的海水里时
So, as I crashed into the cold dark water of the Pacific

611
00:36:46,470 --> 00:36:48,280
我明白了些事情
I realized a few things.

612
00:36:48,810 --> 00:36:51,020
第一  我对要走的路一无所知
A I have no idea where I'm going;

613
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,380
第二  海水可真刺骨
b salt water stings.

614
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,660
第三  我本来早就不在这星球了
C I shouldn't even be on this planet right now,

615
00:36:56,660 --> 00:36:57,960
但我还在
but I am.

616
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,890
-为什么  因为你射了我  -我知道
- Why? Because you shot me! - I know.

617
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,190
你射了我
You shot me!

618
00:37:02,330 --> 00:37:05,000
好了  说一次我就听到了  你没必要
All right. I heard you the first time. You don't have to...

619
00:37:05,130 --> 00:37:06,640
再说一遍  天哪
pile it on, good grief.

620
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:08,940
我湿透了  我冷极了
I'm wet. I'm cold.

621
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,050
我头上还挂着一条鱼
There's a fish on my head!

622
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:14,710
很明显我单单一个人是到不了那里的
And clearly I'm not gonna be able to do this on my own.

623
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,070
好吧  到车上来吧
All right, get in the truck.

624
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:23,370
真的  你要帮我了
Really? You gonna help me?

625
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,100
或许我是有那么一点点错的
I guess it is a little bit of my fault

626
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,650
这些事情发生到你头上
that all of this is happening to you.

627
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,300
不是一点点  是全部
Not a little bit, entirely.

628
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,670
这全部是你的错
It is entirely your fault.

629
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:31,720
好吧  这全部是我的错  你要上来吗
Okay, it's entirely my fault. Are you coming?

630
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:32,950
要
Yes.

631
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:37,300
公路旅行
Roadtrip.

632
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,240
我是在干什么啊
What am I doing?

633
00:37:39,670 --> 00:37:41,770
好了  这次出行是有约法三章的
All right, there's gonna be rules on this trip.

634
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:44,570
第一  自始至终你都得听我的
Number one: do exactly as I say all the time.

635
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,860
-明白吗  -明白  甜甜圈殿下
- Got it? - Got it, Donut Lord.

636
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:48,840
你能不能别叫我甜甜圈殿下了啊
Would you stop with the Donut Lord?

637
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,040
我有名字  我叫汤姆
I have a name. It's Tom.

638
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,710
我叫索尼克
I'm Sonic.

639
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:55,050
索尼克  索尼克
Sonic? Sonic.

640
00:37:56,170 --> 00:37:58,350
所以说  这些年你一直在窥视我们
So, you've been spying on us all for years.

641
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:00,230
我觉得这不叫窥视
I mean, I wouldn't call it spying.

642
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,600
我们都只是出来玩啊
We were all just hanging out,

643
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:02,610
只有我是没人邀请的
only I wasn't invited,

644
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,250
没有人知道我在那儿
and no one knew I was there.

645
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,010
我不敢相信疯子卡尔一直都是对的
I can't believe Crazy Carl was right all this time.

646
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,060
你应该叫他超级观察家卡尔了
Yeah, you should call him Super Observing Carl instead.

647
00:38:10,630 --> 00:38:12,260
我的天啊  马上停车
Oh my God, stop the car right now!

648
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:12,910
什么  什么
What? What?

649
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,400
世界上最大的橡皮筋球
The World's Largest Rubber Band Ball?

650
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,400
我们去看看吧
We gotta see it!

651
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:17,180
不行  不行
No, no.

652
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,990
这不是什么有趣的家庭旅行  好吗
This is not some fun family roadtrip, okay?

653
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,440
政府想要解剖你  逮捕我
The government wants to dissect you, and arrest me.

654
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,240
这事非常严肃
This is serious.

655
00:38:25,870 --> 00:38:27,160
你是对的  它可真差劲
You were right. It was lame.

656
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:27,250
但是礼品店还不错
Gift shop was cool, though.

657
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:28,280
我爱
橡皮筋
但是礼品店还不错
Gift shop was cool, though.

658
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:28,380
我爱
橡皮筋

659
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,750
我给你带了个鼠标垫
I got you a mouse pad.

660
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,610
我们什么时候才能到那里
When are we gonna get there?

661
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,530
该到的时候自然就到了
We will get there when we get there.

662
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,460
好了  我得先去确定一下
All right, I'm gonna go check in with Wade

663
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:55,890
韦德知不知道发生了什么
to see if he knows what's going on.

664
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:58,210
你要到那层玻璃里见韦德
You gonna see Wade in that glass thing?

665
00:38:58,360 --> 00:39:00,310
这是什么  一个传送箱
What is it? A teleportation box?

666
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:03,070
这是公共电话
It's a pay phone.

667
00:39:03,170 --> 00:39:06,000
一般只有毒品贩子和逃犯用得上
It's mostly for drug dealers and fugitives from the law,

668
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:06,580
而我们就是
which is us.

669
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,230
待在车子里  我不想让别人看见你
Stay in the car. I don't want anybody seeing you.

670
00:39:09,530 --> 00:39:10,830
好吧
Fine!

671
00:39:29,360 --> 00:39:32,200
好了  好了  那是世界上最酷的地方
Okay. Okay. That is the coolest place on Earth,

672
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:34,020
但是你必须得待在车里
but you have to stay in the car.

673
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,550
坚持住  坚持住
Be strong. Be strong.

674
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,990
您好  这里是青山镇警察局
Hello. Green Hills Police Department.

675
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:57,920
-韦德  是我  -你能打过来真好
- Wade, it's me. - Hi, I'm so glad that you called.

676
00:39:58,300 --> 00:40:01,440
之前有几个人过来问了些问题
So, some guys came in asking some questions.

677
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,580
有点怪怪的
A little creepy.

678
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:05,270
《黑衣人》：一部美国科幻喜剧电影
样子像是从《黑衣人》里出来的
Kinda reminded me of the guys from Men in Black,

679
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:08,860
但也没有那么像  没有威尔·史密斯有魅力
but not as likable, or charming as Will Smith.

680
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,600
等等  什么样的问题
Wait, what kinda questions?

681
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,020
有关恐怖主义
Questions about terrorism.

682
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:15,030
我跟他们说
I told them that, like...

683
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:16,530
我和汤姆一起去冰上钓过鱼
I've gone ice fishing with Tom.

684
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,680
他不知道怎么做炸弹
He doesn't know how to make a bomb.

685
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:20,600
在大冷天里  甚至连鱼饵也做不了
He can't even make, like bait in the cold.

686
00:40:20,730 --> 00:40:22,930
好了  韦德  听我说  这非常关键
All right, Wade, listen to me. This is really important.

687
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:25,100
我给你打电话这事  别告诉他们
Don't tell them that we talked, okay?

688
00:40:28,030 --> 00:40:30,140
我觉得他们已经知道了
You know, I think they already know.

689
00:40:32,090 --> 00:40:33,690
瓦查斯基先生
Mr. Wachowski.

690
00:40:34,630 --> 00:40:35,780
我叫汤姆
Tom.

691
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,760
我告诉你  除你之外另一个
I want you to know that the only other person

692
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:38,760
往我脸上打了一拳的人
who have ever punched me in the face

693
00:40:38,760 --> 00:40:40,220
是个校园恶霸
was the school bully.

694
00:40:40,970 --> 00:40:42,390
他在自助餐厅里打了我
He hit me in the cafeteria

695
00:40:42,390 --> 00:40:44,760
让我眼眶骨周围的软组织
causing a blunt force contusion to the soft tissue

696
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:46,300
被钝器挫伤
surrounding my orbital bone.

697
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,680
他在全校面前羞辱了我
Humiliated me in front of the entire school.

698
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:49,930
你知道我怎么报复他的吗
And you know what I did in response?

699
00:40:50,970 --> 00:40:53,580
你应该把他举报到了校长办公室
I'm assuming that you reported him to the Principal's office,

700
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,800
因为这种行为真的让人无法接受
'cause, you know that kinda behavior is really unacceptable.

701
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:57,880
没有 我检测了世界会有多么低效
No, I examined the inefficiency of a world

702
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,140
如果满是四肢发达  头脑简单的人
where brawn trumped brain,

703
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:01,990
于是我用科技克服了这种低效
and I used technology to resolve that inefficiency.

704
00:41:01,990 --> 00:41:04,100
那个男孩用吸管吸食自己的肉
The boy ate his meals through a straw

705
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,110
吸了整整一年
for a year.

706
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,530
从此我再也没打输过了
And I have never lost a fight again.

707
00:41:07,530 --> 00:41:08,360
直到今天
Until today.

708
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,340
为我欢呼吧
Hooray for me then, huh?

709
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:13,100
不  因为你即将成为那个吸管男孩
No, because you're about to become the bully with a straw!

710
00:41:13,250 --> 00:41:15,440
我来找你了  瓦查斯基先生
I'm coming for you, Mr. Wachowski.

711
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:17,780
当我抓到你的时候  我要
And when I catch you I'll...

712
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:20,750
喂  喂
Hello? Hello?

713
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:24,480
-喂  喂  -我觉得他把电话挂了
- Hello? Hello? - I think he actually hung up.

714
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:26,090
因为我发现这里的灯暗了
Because I noticed that the light isn't on.

715
00:41:26,110 --> 00:41:27,570
谢谢你  脑残警官
Thank you, Officer Brainfart.

716
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:10,000
再给我一秒钟  我可以接通外线
If you give me a second I can get an outside line.

717
00:41:30,140 --> 00:41:31,930
不  别费事了
No, don't be bothered.

718
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:33,600
你只需要坐在这里
You just sit there

719
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:36,980
继续一无用处
and be you- sless.

720
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,730
没有人要来消除我的记忆吗
No one's gonna erase my memory here?

721
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:49,890
我要把这事告诉别人
I will tell people about this.

722
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,110
来了  算不上最健康的晚餐  但是
Okay, not exactly the healthiest meal, but...

724

你好啊  搭档
Howdy, partner.

726
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:24,590
我不是你搭档  快来  我们要走了
I'm not your partner, come on, we're leaving.

727
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:26,470

但是这里有个ZZ Top摇滚乐队
But there's a ZZ Top cover band,

728
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:27,450

我保证  如果这次让我留下来
If we stay I promise I won't say another word

733
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:32,500

他脸上带着什么  一幅面具

其实他43岁了

得了一种非常罕见的皮肤病

746
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:55,880
就  就像那样

脸是爸妈给的
The face I was born with,

748
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:59,950
但无敌般的自信可是我自己一手培养的

749
00:43:00,540 --> 00:43:02,900
-麻烦给我们做一杯"浓郁日落"  -好的

愿望清单就是

在你翘辫子之前  由你打算完成的事情
It's a list of things you wanna do in your life before you...

759

I've never kicked the bucket either. I gotta make my list.

761
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,340

我还有太多事情没有做过呢
There is so much stuff I've never done.

764

可我马上就要永远离开地球了

怎么说呢  我猜这里大概也算一个
Well, I guess this is the kinda place

767
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:00,790
你可以在短时间内
you can get a lot of living done

768
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:02,660
做很多有意义的事情的地方
in a short period of time.

769
00:44:03,230 --> 00:44:04,930
我想我们可以在这儿逗留上几个小时
I suppose we can spare an hour.

770
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:07,440
什么  你愿意和我一起做愿望清单的事吗

Wait a second, is this bull

778
00:44:45,700 --> 00:44:47,880

779
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:52,380
-放轻松  -好的

790
00:45:26,710 --> 00:45:27,950

Can we help you?

791
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:30,840
我们不想让你们这类人出现在这儿
We don't like your kind around here.

792
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,290
我们这类人  哪类人啊

793
00:45:34,380 --> 00:45:35,580
嬉皮士
Hipsters.

794
00:45:36,140 --> 00:45:37,190

That was amazing!

815
00:48:39,220 --> 00:48:42,120
等一下  我们付小费了吗  那不重要
Wait a second, did we even pay our tip? It doesn't matter!

816
00:48:42,300 --> 00:48:44,920
瞧瞧这个  瞧瞧这个  我一直想做这个
Watch this. Watch this. I always wanted to do this.

817
00:48:48,180 --> 00:48:50,650
-抓住他们  -再见了  人渣们
- Get them! - See ya, suckers.

818
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:54,000
我不是百分百确定  但我感觉他们喜欢我
I can't say for sure, but I think they liked me.

819
00:49:00,050 --> 00:49:01,460
-爽翻了  -爽
- Yes! Yes! - Yeah!

820
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:03,860
他们对你下手挺重
They got you pretty good.

821
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:05,250
我没事  就是结结实实挨了一下
I'm all right, have been hit harder.

822
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:06,330
你看没看到为了做那个木乃伊
Did you see how much

823
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:07,090
我用了多少卫生纸
toilet paper I used?

824
00:49:07,230 --> 00:49:09,370
下一个走进厕所的人都要
The next person that goes into that bathroom

825
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:10,750
没有擦屁股的东西啦
will have nothing to wipe with.

826
00:49:11,260 --> 00:49:13,520
那地板黏糊糊的  人群乱糟糟的
The floors were sticky. The crowd was rough.

827
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:14,920
一切都对我们俩很不利
And the odds were against us.

828
00:49:15,150 --> 00:49:18,420
但没有什么能阻挡甜甜圈殿下和蓝色光影
But there was no stopping Donut Lord and the Blue Blur.

829
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:20,950
可以从清单上再划掉一条了
Scratch another one off my list.

830
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:21,230
在酒吧打一架
可以从清单上再划掉一条了
Scratch another one off my list.

831
00:49:21,230 --> 00:49:22,160
在酒吧打一架

832
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,360
你真是个奇怪的小家伙
You are a weird little dude.

833
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:39,170
-行了  -所以说  我们现在怎么办
- Okay. - So, what are we gonna do now?

834
00:49:40,850 --> 00:49:42,910
我要看会儿电视杀杀时间
I'm gonna pass out watching TV.

835
00:49:43,240 --> 00:49:45,730
-你也看吧  -但这是我在地球上最后一晚
- You should, too. - But this is my last night on Earth.

836
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:48,190
-我想过好最后时光的每一刻  -好吧
- I wanna soak up every last second. - All right, well...

837
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:51,550
做做任何你能在这个房间能做的事吧
Anything you can find to do in this room, you knock yourself out.

838
00:49:58,110 --> 00:50:00,200
我玩得很开心
Good times.

839
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,960
天哪  不是吧
Oh, come on.

840
00:50:04,230 --> 00:50:06,270
臭死了  你吃啥了
That's awful, what did you eat?

841
00:50:06,270 --> 00:50:08,290
那东西好像叫辣热狗
I think it's called a chili dog.

842
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:11,670
你最好检查一下你的毛有没有被崩掉
You might wanna check your fur on that one, buddy.

843
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,210
所以说  你要去的下个星球长什么样子
Hey, so what's this next planet you're supposed to go to like?

844
00:50:15,460 --> 00:50:18,320
和地球完全不一样  我给你说  空无一人
It's no Earth. I can tell you that. There's no people.

845
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:21,370
只有能呼吸的空气和巨大的蘑菇什么的
Just breathable air and giant mushrooms, and stuff.

846
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,620
你不如这么看
Well, look at it this way.

847
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:26,240
至少你不会是唯一一个笑屁
At least you won't be the only fun-gi.

848
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,460
不  别再放屁了
No, don't ever do that again.

849
00:50:30,590 --> 00:50:31,950
我以前也爱这样
I liked it.

850
00:50:33,810 --> 00:50:35,800
我真的会很想念这里的
I'm really gonna miss this place.

851
00:50:36,060 --> 00:50:38,130
我知道我应该为了安全离开地球
I know I have to leave Earth to be safe,

852
00:50:38,130 --> 00:50:39,620
但如果长爪鸟是错的呢
but what if Longclaw was wrong?

853
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,910
也许我也能在这里生活
Maybe I could have a life here.

854
00:50:47,580 --> 00:50:49,920
好啦  我们该睡一会儿了
All right, we should get some sleep.

855
00:50:51,360 --> 00:50:54,510
你睡吧  不用管我  我要用一整晚时间
You sleep, don't worry about me, I'm gonna stay up all night

856
00:50:54,660 --> 00:50:56,440
趁来得及  好好享受地球
enjoying Earth while I can.

857
00:50:56,640 --> 00:50:57,970
没问题  小子
Sure, kid.

858
00:50:58,610 --> 00:51:00,760
记住我们要在八点钟上路
As long as we're on the road by eight.

859
00:51:19,030 --> 00:51:20,530
交一个真正的朋友

860
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,090
托马斯·瓦查斯基  被指控实施了
Thomas Wachowski, accused of committing

861
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:28,770
国内恐怖主义活动
an act of domestic terrorism.

862
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:31,970
瓦查斯基携带了武器  而且极度危险
Wachowski is considered armed and dangerous.

863
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:35,240
如果您有关于他的信息  请立即向
Any information regarding his whereabouts should be reported

864
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,230
地方当局汇报
to local authorities immediately.

865
00:51:43,450 --> 00:51:45,400
他有没有提到他要去哪里
Did he say where he was going?

866
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,750
也许说了  也许没有
Maybe. Maybe not.

867
00:51:51,890 --> 00:51:53,590
我就这一句话
Like I'd ever tell you.

868
00:51:54,940 --> 00:51:56,500
退后  斯通特工
Stand down, Agent Stone.

869
00:51:56,570 --> 00:51:59,040
这个好心的公民很明显没有明白
This well-meaning citizen obviously doesn't understand

870
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,150
整件事情的紧急性
the urgency of the matter.

871
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,940
真的吗
Really?

872
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,910
这就是我说的那个叫"好坏警察"的游戏
Now, that's what I call 'good cop, bad cop'.

873
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:14,510
你露出破绽了
Left yourself open.

874
00:52:17,060 --> 00:52:19,050
根据去旧金山最近的路线
Judging by the quickest route to San Francisco,

875
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:21,060
他们车子的平均速度
the approximate speed of their vehicle

876
00:52:21,060 --> 00:52:22,290
以及当地天气情况来判断
and local weather conditions...

877
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:25,450
他们应该
They should be...

878
00:52:26,110 --> 00:52:28,050
就在
right about...

879
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,430
这里
here.

880
00:52:30,730 --> 00:52:33,960
-你太聪明了  先生  -谢谢  你个大头鬼
- That's brilliant, Sir. - Thanks... for nothing.

881
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,890
欢迎来到加州

882
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:38,020
-话说  你的愿望清单上有什么  -我吗
- So, what's on your bucket list? - Me?
欢迎来到加州

883
00:52:38,020 --> 00:52:39,370
-话说  你的愿望清单上有什么  -我吗
- So, what's on your bucket list? - Me?

884
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:41,630
对  人人都有愿望清单  对吗
Yeah, everyone has a bucket list, right?

885
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:42,310
当然啦  可是
Well, sure, but...

886
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:44,290
你才是即将离开地球的那个人
I mean, you are the one leaving Earth.

887
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,660
而我最近还没有赴死的打算
And I'm not planning on dying anytime soon.

888
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:49,970
别这么确定  你最好的朋友可是个扫把星
Don't be so sure, your best friend is a magnet for danger.

889
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,030
你说你是我最好的朋友吗
You're anointing yourself as the bestie?

890
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,190
有一点冒昧  但是
Little presumptuous, but... I mean...

891
00:52:55,670 --> 00:52:57,820
我挺喜欢你的  这没的说  可是
I like you, of course, but...

892
00:52:58,050 --> 00:52:59,780
你要知道  我们不是最好的朋友
You know, we're not best friends.

893
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,880
你昨天晚上抱我了啊
You tucked me in last night.

894
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:04,060
好吧  那就是最好的动物朋友
Fine, fine. Best animal friend.

895
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,170
那应该是奥兹  我的狗狗
That would be my dog Ozzy.

896
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,280
行吧  我们还是不谈这个越来越
Okay, let's drop this increasingly

897
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:09,110
让人丢脸的话题了吧
humiliating topic of conversation.

898
00:53:09,330 --> 00:53:11,120
你的愿望清单  快告诉我
Bucket list. Give it to me.

899
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:13,490
好吧  有一件事
Okay, there is one thing.

900
00:53:14,390 --> 00:53:16,320
在青山镇我一直觉得
In Green Hills I've always felt,

901
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:19,870
自己不是警察  而是个保姆  你知道吧
I don't know, more like a baby sitter than a real cop, you know?

902
00:53:20,060 --> 00:53:21,850
所以我想找一个能在压力下
So, I want a chance to prove myself

903
00:53:21,850 --> 00:53:22,890
证明我自己的机会
under real pressure.

904
00:53:23,060 --> 00:53:25,830
我要搬到旧金山去  当一个巡逻警
I'm gonna move to San Francisco, become a street cop.

905
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:29,090
我不知道会怎么样  看之后会发生什么吧
And, I don't know, see if I have what it takes.

906
00:53:30,250 --> 00:53:31,470
怎么了
What?

907
00:53:32,730 --> 00:53:34,800
你为什么一副那样的表情
Why is your face doing that?

908
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:36,260
你要离开青山镇吗
You're leaving Green Hills?!

909
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:38,980
-原来是这样  -可是  为什么啊
- Okay. - Bu... But... But why?

910
00:53:39,030 --> 00:53:40,540
你为什么要离开青山镇啊
Why would you leave Green Hills?

911
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,090
这对你来说可能难以理解
This maybe hard for you to understand,

912
00:53:42,230 --> 00:53:44,860
但青山镇是个太小  太小的镇子
but Green Hills is a small town, it's a very small town.

913
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:47,460
一点也不小啊  有几百号人呢
It's not small. There are hundreds of people.

914
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,160
这算是小镇子了  兄弟
That's a small town, dude.

915
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,970
这是个完美的小镇  这里的人需要你
It's a perfect town, and the people need you.

916
00:53:52,080 --> 00:53:53,730
拜托  我做的事就是帮他们清理水沟
Please, I clean up their gutters,

917
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:55,420
帮他们在冬天启动车子
I jumpstart their cars in the winter.

918
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:57,250
他们可以叫任何人去做这些事
They can call anybody to do that.

919
00:53:57,370 --> 00:53:59,450
没错  他们是可以叫任何人
Sure, they can call anybody,

920
00:53:59,450 --> 00:54:00,880
但他们没有  他们叫的是你
but the don't. They call you.

921
00:54:33,750 --> 00:54:35,190
你说的话一点道理也没有
You're not making any sense.

922
00:54:35,190 --> 00:54:35,910
你能不能冷静下来啊
Would you calm down?

923
00:54:35,930 --> 00:54:37,970
你生活在一个有着超赞居民的超赞的镇子
You come from a great town with great people,

924
00:54:38,120 --> 00:54:40,770
而且就我估计想杀死你的坏人数量为零
and by my count zero bad guys trying to kill you.

925
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,500
再说  还有什么能比保护你在乎的人们
Besides, what could possibly be more important

926
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:47,960
更重要的事情呢
than protecting the people you care about?

927
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:55,510
听着  我懂你
Look, I get...

928
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:58,660
好
Yeah!

929
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:07,950
你知道吗  我看错你了
You know what? I was wrong about you.

930
00:55:07,950 --> 00:55:09,610
你从来就不是什么甜甜圈殿下
You're not the Donut Lord at all.

931
00:55:09,730 --> 00:55:11,590
你更像是一个混蛋殿下之类的东西
You're more like the Jerk Lord.

932
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:14,330
你难道没注意到有个鱼叉扎到了咱的车吗
Have you noticed the harpoon stuck in our dash?!

933
00:55:20,330 --> 00:55:21,330
索尼克
Sonic!

934
00:55:21,360 --> 00:55:22,810
我背井离乡是被迫的
I was forced from my home,

935
00:55:22,810 --> 00:55:24,960
而你却自己要离开你那甜蜜的温柔乡
your home is perfect and you're leaving it.

936
00:55:25,100 --> 00:55:26,740
你为什么要那么做
Why would you do that?

937
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:29,200
-你的身体怎么回事  -不不  别又来了啊
- Your body! - No, no! Not again!

938
00:55:29,430 --> 00:55:31,230
-抓紧了  -为啥
- Hey, hold on! - Why?

939
00:55:31,350 --> 00:55:32,720
因为我要飙车了
Because I'm gonna do this.

940
00:55:51,310 --> 00:55:52,510
索尼克
Sonic!

941
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,910
我猜我应该是有额外的一条命吧
Guess I had a bonus life.

942
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:05,660
帅呆了  宝贝儿
Yeah, baby!

943
00:56:05,860 --> 00:56:08,040
索尼克对阵坦克  索尼克胜出
Sonic - one, big tank - zero.

944
00:56:08,370 --> 00:56:10,220
不好意思  刚才这段被拍下来了吗
I'm sorry. Did we get this on camera?

945
00:56:10,330 --> 00:56:12,700
-你怎么可能没死呢  -我也不知道啊
- How are you not dead? - I have no idea.

946
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,490
但你看到我跳的舞了吗
But do you see me dancing?

947
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:17,150
-嗯  我看到你跳舞了  -你就这点本事吗
- Yes, I saw your dance. - Is that all you've got?

948
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:19,240
当然不是  但谢谢你这么问
No, but thank you for asking.

950
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:27,100
-快回到皮卡上来  -你先走  我会跟上的
- Get back in the truck! - You go, I'll catch up.

951
00:56:38,290 --> 00:56:40,560
我觉得那辆坦克好像生了个娃
I think that tank just had a baby.

952
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,590
要被打到了
Incoming!

953
00:56:56,700 --> 00:56:59,310
-该我了  -你才玩过一次  该我了
- It's my turn! - You just had one. It's mine!

954
00:56:59,470 --> 00:57:01,590
别打了  不然我就把它没收了
Hey, stop fighting, or I'm taking that thing away!

955
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:02,920
好吧  老爸
Yeah, right, Dad.

956
00:57:14,820 --> 00:57:16,810
-你去哪  -你好好开车
- Where are you going? - Just drive the car.

957
00:57:16,980 --> 00:57:18,500
我来处理那小坦克
I'll take care of this.

958
00:57:18,690 --> 00:57:20,550
如果我失败了  把我抛下离开就好
And if I don't make it, just ditch me,

959
00:57:20,690 --> 00:57:22,070
反正你挺擅长这么做的
you seem good at that.

960
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,740
哈喽大家好  欢迎继续收看我的现场直播
Hey, everyone, welcome back to my livestream.

961
00:57:33,860 --> 00:57:36,090
今天我们来表演摧毁机器人  这是第一步
Today, we're destroying robots. Step one.

962
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:42,840
太好了  我们做到了
Yes! We did it!

963
00:57:47,580 --> 00:57:50,100
我们没做到  这家伙是谁啊
We did not do it. Who is this guy?

964
00:57:50,510 --> 00:57:52,680
你难道没想过你交的税都用到哪里了吗
Ever wonder where your tax dollars are going?

965
00:57:52,830 --> 00:57:55,170
该我了  过来  让车保持笔直前行就好
My turn, here, just keep us going straight.

966
00:57:55,520 --> 00:57:56,870
我开了定速巡航
I put on cruise control.

967
00:57:57,120 --> 00:57:57,140
我感觉自己就像范·迪塞尔
I feel just like Vin Diesel.

我感觉自己就像范·迪塞尔
I feel just like Vin Diesel.

969
00:57:59,120 --> 00:57:59,140
这都是为了家人  汤姆
It's all about family, Tom.
《速度与激情》主演

这都是为了家人  汤姆
It's all about family, Tom.

971
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:09,040
小贴士
Quick suggestion.

972
00:58:09,040 --> 00:58:11,730
卷成一个球  滚动你的身体去撞它
Roll up into a ball and smash him with your body.

973
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:15,310
天哪  你是怎么学的开车
Whoa! Where'd you learn how to drive?!

974
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:18,030
我就在这辆皮卡里面现学
Here, in this truck, it's happening as we speak.

975
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:22,960
我碰不到它  让我离它更近一点
I can't reach it, bring it in closer.

976
00:58:23,090 --> 00:58:25,470
-你说啥  -让我靠近一点  踩刹车
- What? - Bring it in closer. Hit the brakes.

977
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:28,650
-你是说这个吗  -另外一个踏板
- Oh, you mean this one? - The other brakes!

978
00:58:43,050 --> 00:58:46,220
让我好好歇会儿吧
Give me a big fat break!

979
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:54,300
这个还挺可爱的  我们留着它吧
This one is cute, let's keep him.

980
00:58:57,900 --> 00:58:59,020
天哪  别这样
Oh, come on!

981
00:58:59,150 --> 00:59:01,470
为什么这么可爱的东西会这么吓人
How can something so adorable be so terrible.

982
00:59:04,810 --> 00:59:06,700
你买车辆保险了  对吧
You got car insurance, right?

983
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:14,520
走开
Buzz off!

984
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:16,090
这听上去不太妙
That doesn't sound good.

985
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:17,590
不不不  哔哔声意味着非常不妙  快扔掉
No, beeping means bad! Get rid of it!

986
00:59:17,710 --> 00:59:18,430
我在试啊
I'm trying.

987
00:59:18,550 --> 00:59:20,530
把它扔出去  扔哪儿都行
Just throw it off the window! Throw it anywhere!

988
00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:23,010
-粘住了弄不掉  -好吧  那我靠边停车
- I can't get it off! - All right, I'm pulling over.

989
00:59:30,590 --> 00:59:32,420
-弄掉了吗  -没有
- Did I get it? - No.

990
00:59:34,210 --> 00:59:35,780
让我来  别动
Here, hold still.

991
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,320
扔掉了  它没了
It's going. It's going.

992
00:59:38,570 --> 00:59:39,920
它还在
It's still here.

993
00:59:43,070 --> 00:59:46,290
给我下去  搞定
Get off me! Nailed it!

994
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:57,280
索尼克
Sonic!

995
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:05,630
不  不
No, no.

996
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,370
振作起来  你会没事的
Hey, come on. You're all right.

997
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:16,680
醒醒  醒醒
Wake up. Wake up.

998
01:00:23,420 --> 01:00:24,830
我们搞定他们了吗
Did we get them?

999
01:00:25,550 --> 01:00:27,430
不  他们还在
Oh, no, there they are.

1000
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:30,430
这两个人真是福大命大
They are real survivors, those two.

1001
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:37,160
我们好好谈谈
Can we have a moment?

1002
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:41,630
自己把自己摁到墙上去
Pin yourself to the wall.

1003
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:44,780
要是你消失了  我连想都不可能想起你
You know, I won't miss you when you're gone.

1004
01:00:44,900 --> 01:00:47,420
人类总是既狡猾又愚蠢
Human beings are unreliable and stupid,

1005
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,840
我对他们不屑一顾
and I care very little about them.

1006
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:51,320
但我的机器却勤恳运作  残忍无情
But my machines are diligent, relentless.

1007
01:00:51,530 --> 01:00:53,470
他们就是我的一切
They're everything to me!

1008
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:09,820
真有趣

1009
01:01:31,320 --> 01:01:33,910
坚持住  伙计  你会没事的
Hold on, buddy. You'll be all right.

1010
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:35,770
你会没事的
You'll be all right.

1011
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:42,070
-求求你  雷切尔  -不  不  今天不行
- I beg you, Rachel. - No, no. Not today.

1012
01:01:42,080 --> 01:01:43,210
-这次是紧急情况  -再见
- No. It's an emergency.  - Goodbye.

1013
01:01:43,210 --> 01:01:43,500
走好不送
Bye bye.

1014
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:45,510
-停下来听我说  开下门  玛蒂  -再见
- Would you stop? Open it please. Maddie! - Bye. Bye.

1015
01:01:45,530 --> 01:01:47,130
别这样  我有急事相求
Don't do this to me please. It's important.

1016
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,770
汤姆  我的天啊  雷切尔放他进来了
Tom! Oh my God. Rachel let him in!

1017
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:49,870
我要报警  不
I am calling the Police. No,

1018
01:01:49,880 --> 01:01:51,590
我要打给联邦调查局和中情局电话
I am calling the FBI. I am calling the CIA.

1019
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:53,140
-我要找人来  -别叫人
- I am calling someone. - Don't do that.

1020
01:01:53,170 --> 01:01:54,810
-我要给你妈妈打电话  -好了好了  够了
- I'm calling your Mother. - Okay. Got it.

1021
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:55,770
玛蒂  我们能不能
Maddie, can we just...

1022
01:01:55,770 --> 01:01:56,640
汤姆  你这是演哪一出
Tom, what's going on?

1023
01:01:56,660 --> 01:01:58,870
你都上新闻了  我还一直有给你打电话
You're all over the news. I've been trying to call you.

1024
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,860
为了防止被跟踪  我把手机扔了
I had to ditch my phone so they couldn't track me.

1025
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,120
-把手机扔了  -跟踪  你
- Ditch his phone? - Track? You?

1026
01:02:02,230 --> 01:02:03,920
-汤姆叔叔  -乔乔  你好啊
- Uncle Tommy! - Jojo! Hey.

1027
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:06,560
好了  现在你侄女也成了叛国者从犯
Now your niece is an accessory to treason.

1028
01:02:06,560 --> 01:02:07,230
她不是从犯
She's not.

1029
01:02:07,430 --> 01:02:10,540
-你能冷静点吗  -冷静  我能冷静下来吗
- Would you calm down. - Calm down? I will not calm down!

1030
01:02:10,690 --> 01:02:12,050
好了好了  冷静  都别说了
Yes, calm down. Stop talking.

1031
01:02:12,050 --> 01:02:14,040
别闹  奥兹  拜托  我见到你也很开心
No, Ozzy, please. I know, good to see you.

1032
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,130
-别咬  松开  奥兹  住嘴  -噢我的神啊
- No, no! Ozzy, stop! - Oh, good ol' Lord Baby Jesus!

1033
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,070
你抱着什么  汤姆  是钚还是机密邮件
What is that, Tom? Is it plutonium? Is it emails?

1034
01:02:20,190 --> 01:02:21,170
是的  就是钚元素
Yes, it's plutonium.

1035
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:23,580
我们能否  先去你房间然后再细谈
Can we just please... Can we just go to your room and talk...

1036
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:24,710
住嘴  奥兹  松开
Stop it, Ozzy! Quit it!

1037
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,580
这就是我为什么说他很差劲
This is why I told you he was no good.

1038
01:02:26,580 --> 01:02:27,360
我根本没有了解
I'm not engaging...

1039
01:02:27,650 --> 01:02:29,230
-别 奥兹  松开  -门现在倒是开得敞亮
- No, Ozzy, quit it! - Door now open.

1040
01:02:29,360 --> 01:02:30,520
-我锁上了  -不  你没有
- Locked. - No, it's unlocked.

1041
01:02:30,870 --> 01:02:32,950
奥兹  不  奥兹  不  不
Ozzy, no! Ozzy! No, no!

1042
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:36,080
快来扶我一下  乔乔
Oh, catch me, Jojo.

1043
01:02:38,140 --> 01:02:39,820
谢天谢地
Oh, thank God!

1044
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:42,340
我能喝杯水吗
Can I get a glass of water?

1045
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,200
《无秩之音》

1046
01:03:25,620 --> 01:03:28,620
邪恶实验室
机器人

1047
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:28,680
机器人

1048
01:03:42,970 --> 01:03:44,430
样本检测完毕

1049
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:53,980
奎尔能量值
测量中

1050
01:03:53,980 --> 01:03:54,000
测量中

1051
01:04:13,130 --> 01:04:15,600
能量测量结果
正在确定

1052
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:15,640
正在确定

1053
01:04:23,520 --> 01:04:25,090
我想  您也许想来杯
I just thought you might like

1054
01:04:25,090 --> 01:04:27,000
奥地利羊奶盖拿铁
a latte with steamed Austrian goat milk.

1055
01:04:27,460 --> 01:04:29,410
你觉得我像什么  像个白痴吗
What do I look like, an imbecile?

1056
01:04:29,420 --> 01:04:30,800
我当然要喝拿铁
Of course, I want a latte!

1057
01:04:31,020 --> 01:04:32,940
我还就喜欢你做的拿铁
I love the way you make them!

1058
01:04:36,540 --> 01:04:38,990
能量分析  无限

1059
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,900
去备好原型机
Ready the prototype.

1060
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:44,070
有了这些能量
With this kind of power

1061
01:04:44,070 --> 01:04:47,830
我这些机器的潜能终于能发挥到极致
my machines can finally reach their full potential.

1062
01:04:54,240 --> 01:04:56,090
他会没事的  乔乔
He's gonna be okay, Jojo.

1063
01:04:57,490 --> 01:04:59,840
谢天谢地  他会好起来的  对吧
Oh, thank God. He's gonna be okay, right?

1064
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:00,970
我是个兽医  汤姆
I'm a vet, Tom,

1065
01:05:00,970 --> 01:05:02,870
而我甚至都不知道他是个什么物种
I don't even know what I'm looking at here.

1066
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:04,960
他是只刺猬  至少他说自己是刺猬
Well, he's a hedgehog... Or so he says.

1067
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:06,850
-他会说话吗  -会  而且喋喋不休
- It talks? - Almost constantly.

1068
01:05:07,160 --> 01:05:08,170
好的
Okay.

1069
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:11,020
-天啊      -怎么了
- Holy... - What?

1070
01:05:11,190 --> 01:05:12,810
他脉搏跳得非常快
Its pulse is super fast.

1071
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:15,070
或许  对他来说是正常的
Well, that actually might be normal for him.

1072
01:05:15,130 --> 01:05:17,090
我也不知道  你得救救他  玛蒂
I don't know. You gotta help him, Maddie.

1073
01:05:17,100 --> 01:05:18,430
可我都不知道他正常的生理体征
I don't know his physiology.

1074
01:05:18,560 --> 01:05:21,480
好像没有骨折的迹象  只是
He doesn't seem to have any broken bones. He's just...

1075
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:23,910
他真的伤得很重
really banged up.

1076
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:27,170
你看他可怜的小脚
Look at his poor little feet.

1077
01:05:30,780 --> 01:05:33,380
坚持住  伙计  你会没事的
Hang in there, buddy. You're gonna be all right.

1078
01:05:36,620 --> 01:05:39,240
乔乔  快来给妈  乔乔
Jojo, untie your Mo... Jojo!

给妈妈松绑一下  亲爱的
Untie Mommy. Sweetie.

1080
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,110
乔乔
Jojo!

1081
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:48,610
我想上厕所
I have to go to the bathroom.

1082
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,450
他会没事的  对吧
He's gonna be okay, right?

1083
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,130
他会好起来的  不久就会醒来是吧
Like he's gonna snap outta this. He'll wake up soon.

1084
01:05:53,330 --> 01:05:55,650
对  嗅盐  你应该有兽医用嗅盐之类的吧
Oh, smelling salts! Don't you have like vet smelling salts,

1085
01:05:55,770 --> 01:05:58,000
比如给猫用的  或者给鹦鹉用的  之类的
like for cats, or parakeets or something?

1086
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:01,070
-不  没人生产猫嗅盐  -为什么不生产呢
- No, they don't make cat smelling salts. - They should.

1087
01:06:01,500 --> 01:06:05,580
我的  人用急救箱里  放了些人用嗅盐
I have human smelling salts in my human first aid kit.

1088
01:06:06,860 --> 01:06:08,110
好了
Okay.

1089
01:06:10,310 --> 01:06:11,460
拜托快醒来  伙计
Come on, buddy.

1090
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:12,930
要跑得快
Gotta go fast!

1091
01:06:16,350 --> 01:06:17,660
我在哪  今年是哪一年
Where am I? What year is it?

1092
01:06:17,660 --> 01:06:18,710
巨石强森当总统了吗
Is the Rock President?

1093
01:06:18,840 --> 01:06:20,780
停  停  伙计  你没事了  冷静点
Whoa, whoa, buddy. You're okay. Calm down.

1094
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:23,120
-你好啊  椒盐卷饼夫人  -你好
- Oh, hi Pretzel Lady! - Hi.

1095
01:06:24,050 --> 01:06:25,050
汤姆
Tom?

1096
01:06:25,220 --> 01:06:27,000
-怎么了  -我能和你谈谈吗
- Yeah? - Can I talk to you please?

1097
01:06:30,170 --> 01:06:32,210
太空刺猬  待在那儿  尽量休息一下
Space hedgehog, stay there. Try to rest.

1098
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:34,120
没问题  我最擅长休息了
You got it. I am great at resting.

1099
01:06:34,120 --> 01:06:35,530
论休息谁也比不过我
I rest better than anybody.

1100
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:37,300
还是说个不停
Still talking.

1101
01:06:37,430 --> 01:06:40,070
首先  我们能花一点时间确认一下
First of all, can we take a moment to acknowledge

1102
01:06:40,070 --> 01:06:41,070
我刚刚是不是很冷静
how under control I've been.

1103
01:06:41,180 --> 01:06:42,540
-你很棒  -没被吓坏
- Amazing. - Didn't freak out.

1104
01:06:42,660 --> 01:06:44,520
-没有  -完全冷静
- No. - Totally calm.

1105
01:06:44,930 --> 01:06:46,470
谢谢了
Thank you.

1106
01:06:47,190 --> 01:06:48,880
其次
Second of all,

1107
01:06:49,390 --> 01:06:52,340
到底是怎么回事  他是个外星人吗
what the heck is going on?! Is that thing an alien?

1108
01:06:52,490 --> 01:06:54,660
这么说吧  还记得疯狂的卡尔总是
Okay, so, remember how Crazy Carl

1109
01:06:54,660 --> 01:06:56,900
对蓝恶魔那么疯狂吗
is always going on about the Blue Devil?

1110
01:06:57,780 --> 01:06:59,890
-原来是他  他是真的吗  -对
- That's him. He's real? - Dah!

1111
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:02,490
那他来这里干什么  还有你又这里干什么
What is he doing here? What are you doing here?

1112
01:07:03,630 --> 01:07:06,780
我用你的麻醉枪击倒了这个蓝色的小朋友
I kinda sorta shot our little blue friend with your tranq gun.

1113
01:07:06,910 --> 01:07:09,210
-不  你不是吧  -我不是  我不是故意的
- No, you did not! - I didn't... I didn't mean to.

1114
01:07:09,330 --> 01:07:11,380
好吧  解释清楚有点难
Okay, this is kinda hard for me to explain.

1115
01:07:11,450 --> 01:07:13,180
而且听起来也有点疯狂
And it's gonna sound a little bit crazy.

1116
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:15,230
他得去泛美大厦
He has to get to the Transamerica building,

1117
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:16,660
而且我答应要带他去
and I promised I'd take him.

1118
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:19,120
外星人
Aliens?

1119
01:07:19,390 --> 01:07:21,400
玛蒂  你老公已经疯了
Maddie, your husband's lost his mind.

1120
01:07:21,540 --> 01:07:23,920
你正好利用这个机会赶紧离开他吧
You can use this as an opportunity to leave him.

1121
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,150
大家也都会理解你的
No one would judge you.

1122
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:32,530
穿这个  你就不会伤到你的脚了
So you won't hurt your feet anymore.

1123
01:07:33,030 --> 01:07:34,390
真的吗
Really?

1124
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:37,670
还从来没人送过我礼物呢
No one's ever given me a gift before.

1125
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:40,680
我得从把这一项从我的清单上去掉
I gotta check that off my bucket list.

1126
01:07:50,060 --> 01:07:51,980
真棒  感觉很不错
All right. Lookin' good.

1127
01:07:55,100 --> 01:07:56,260
好吧
Okay.

1128
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:59,430
你说过  你想帮助真正有麻烦的人  对吧
You said you wanted to help people in real trouble, right?

1129
01:07:59,900 --> 01:08:01,280
你也一直在这么做
Well, that's what you're doing.

1130
01:08:01,470 --> 01:08:04,970
那蓝色的外星人刺猬也算人  不是吗
Blue alien hedgehogs still count as people, right?

1131
01:08:05,130 --> 01:08:06,390
-我也这么觉得  -是啊
- I think so, too. - Yeah.

1132
01:08:06,520 --> 01:08:08,030
-至少我觉得  -好
- I think. - Okay.

1133
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:10,150
我爱你  我记不得有没有告诉过你
I love you. Did I tell you that already?

1134
01:08:10,150 --> 01:08:11,880
但我配不上你  你知道吗
I don't deserve you, you know that?

1135
01:08:12,070 --> 01:08:13,620
我知道
I know that.

1136
01:08:16,110 --> 01:08:17,110
所以
So,

1137
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:19,210
你应该就是那个汤姆最好的
you're supposed to be Tom's best friend

1138
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:20,790
绝不会拒之门外的朋友吧
that he won't shut up about.

1139
01:08:22,370 --> 01:08:24,200
可我也看不出你哪里吸引他
Well, I don't see the appeal.

1140
01:08:25,980 --> 01:08:28,670
别舔了  这也太恶心了
Stop. That is very gross.

1141
01:08:31,960 --> 01:08:33,630
是这样  我的卡车还能开
So, my truck still runs,

1142
01:08:33,630 --> 01:08:35,310
但也将近面目全非了
but it's pretty much totaled.

1143
01:08:35,430 --> 01:08:37,630
你说你姐姐会不会介意我们借她车一用
You think your sister would mind if we borrowed her car?

1144
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:39,550
你开什么玩笑
You have got to be kidding me!

1145
01:08:40,270 --> 01:08:42,500
-她会适应的  -对  那走吧
- She'll be fine. - Yes, let's do that.

1146
01:08:42,850 --> 01:08:45,040
这里是我家
This is my house!

1147
01:08:47,430 --> 01:08:50,720
我该转了  我这车开得左摇右摆的
Now this is my turn. And I pull around him.

1148
01:08:50,870 --> 01:08:53,390
抱歉  完美刹车
Sorry. And... perfect park.

1149
01:08:53,690 --> 01:08:54,690
你疯了吗
What are you, crazy?

1150
01:08:54,690 --> 01:08:56,410
路上的东西怕是都被你撞过一遍了
Is there anything you didn't hit?

1151
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,060
我们为什么要让外星人开车
Why did we let the alien drive?

1152
01:08:58,060 --> 01:08:59,300
至少我开车还是把大家送到了
Hey, I got us here.

1153
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:01,370
麻烦给个五星好评
And please, five stars.

1154
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,920
所以  就是这了吗
So, this is it?

1155
01:09:04,110 --> 01:09:05,760
就是这儿  快看  你要的金字塔
That's it. That's your pyramid.

1156
01:09:06,290 --> 01:09:09,360
-快看  这擎天高楼  -那接下来怎么办
- Wow! Look at that thing. - What happens now?

1157
01:09:10,260 --> 01:09:12,830
-他  他跑了  -对
- Oh, he's... gone. - Yup.

1158
01:09:14,090 --> 01:09:16,790
没用  得要特定的钥匙才能到楼顶去
No good. You need a special key to get to the roof.

1159
01:09:17,770 --> 01:09:19,350
现在怎么办
What now?

1160
01:09:19,510 --> 01:09:22,710
我是时候滥用一次职权了
Time for me to abuse the power entrusted to me.

1161
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:33,940
楼顶有人想跳楼轻生
We got a jumper on the roof.

1162
01:09:34,060 --> 01:09:35,830
我们得尽快上去  免得
Gotta get up there fast, or we're gonna

1163
01:09:35,830 --> 01:09:37,390
待会就变成一个肉饼了
have a human pancake on our hands.

1164
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,870
所以  你从蒙大拿州一路赶来阻止他吗
You came all the way from Montana?

1165
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:42,340
是啊  事态已经非常严重
Yup, that's how serious it is.

1166
01:09:46,780 --> 01:09:48,120
好吧
Okay.

1167
01:09:49,540 --> 01:09:51,160
你刚刚挽救了一条生命
You just saved a life.

1168
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:55,980
快啊  快啊
Come on. Come on.

1169
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:02,450
还要多久啊  这里面根本呼吸不了
How much longer? I can't breathe in here.

1170
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:06,910
你好  有人吗
Hello? Anybody there?

1171
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:09,030
你是把你的孩子装进了这个包里吗
Do you have your child in that bag?

1172
01:10:09,260 --> 01:10:10,410
不是
No.

1173
01:10:10,570 --> 01:10:13,020
我是说  是的  是个孩子  但不是我的
I mean yes, it's a child, but it's not mine.

1174
01:10:14,140 --> 01:10:15,520
不是你的孩子吗
It's not your child?

1175
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:17,910
别紧张  我是警察  好吗
Relax, I'm a cop, okay?

1176
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:19,870
而且他也喜欢待在包里  是吧  伙计
Plus he likes it in there, don't you, buddy?

1177
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:21,300
我为什么会想待在包里
Why would I like it in here?

1178
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:24,330
这包还不如你之前关我的狗笼呢
This is worse than the dog cage you had me in earlier.

1179
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:26,780
真是孩子气
Such a kidder.

1180
01:10:27,790 --> 01:10:29,200
好了
Okay.

1181
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:31,950
不要啊  我怕黑  有人在吗
No, I'm scared of the dark! Is anybody there?

1182
01:10:45,140 --> 01:10:47,250
你的包都用来装些什么啊
What were you keeping in this bag?

1183
01:10:47,490 --> 01:10:49,220
你要在里面腌一罐臭屁吗
A jar of pickled farts?

1184
01:10:49,380 --> 01:10:51,660
好吧  好吧  所以要在这儿找什么东西
All right, all right, what are we looking for?

1185
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:55,490
这个
This!

1186
01:10:55,950 --> 01:10:58,080
好吧  然后呢
Okay, what happens now?

1187
01:10:58,190 --> 01:10:59,520
现在  我要做的就是
Now, all I have to do is think of

1188
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,600
想想让戒指的另一边出现在什么地方
where I want the other end of the ring to appear,

1189
01:11:01,730 --> 01:11:03,420
-然后把戒指扔出去  -就这样吗
- and I throw it. - So, that's it?

1190
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,720
-我们做到了吗  -对  我们做到了
- We did it? - Yeah. We did it.

1191
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:08,210
抱歉  没能把你
Hey, sorry we didn't get to do everything

1192
01:11:08,210 --> 01:11:09,940
愿望清单上的事都挨件做完  伙计
on your bucket list, pal.

1193
01:11:10,100 --> 01:11:12,940
没事的  我做到了其中我最想做的
It's okay. I did the ones I needed the most.

1194
01:11:13,860 --> 01:11:17,560
-你们俩真可爱  就像  -拜托  你说啥
- You two are so cute, like... - Oh, please. What?

1195
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,740
-我们才不可爱  -不  我们一点都不可爱
- We are not. - No, we're not cute.

1196
01:11:19,880 --> 01:11:21,520
我们俩都只会我行我素
We are a couple of loose cannons

1197
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:23,010
按自己的规则来生活
just living by our own rules.

1198
01:11:23,140 --> 01:11:24,680
-没错  是的  -真的吗
- Exactly. Yeah. - Really?

1199
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:27,980
诉说一些真挚的情感也是我们的规则
And our rules include expressing heartfelt emotions.

1200
01:11:28,130 --> 01:11:29,300
好的  听你的
If you say so.

1201
01:11:29,530 --> 01:11:31,040
那好
Okay then.

1202
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:32,370
好了
All right.

1203
01:11:33,450 --> 01:11:35,450
-你得走了  是吗  -对  我得走了  所以
- You gotta go, right? - Yeah, I gotta go, so...

1204
01:11:35,570 --> 01:11:37,120
我得走了  我们也得走了
I gotta go. We gotta go, too.

1205
01:11:37,120 --> 01:11:38,740
所以  这样的话  好吧  再见
So, see... All right. Bye bye.

1206
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:44,570
还有一件事
Just one more thing.

1207
01:11:52,640 --> 01:11:54,780
对不起  我对你要求太多了
I'm sorry I was so hard on you.

1208
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:58,810
我知道  选择离开青山镇
I know it's a tough decision

1209
01:11:58,810 --> 01:12:00,050
对你来说挺不容易
for you to leave Green Hills.

1210
01:12:00,420 --> 01:12:03,120
离开你在乎的东西
Walking away from something you care about

1211
01:12:03,590 --> 01:12:05,280
一定很痛苦
has to be painful.

1212
01:12:05,410 --> 01:12:07,450
你不太确定你是不是真的想走  对吗
You're not sure you really wanna go, huh?

1213
01:12:08,290 --> 01:12:11,190
我不想走  但我也不能留在原地
I don't wanna go, but I can't stay.

1214
01:12:11,730 --> 01:12:14,500
只要我在这儿  大家就都不安全
As long as I'm here I put everyone in danger.

1215
01:12:14,880 --> 01:12:16,370
我不能置大家于险地
I can't do that.

1216
01:12:17,310 --> 01:12:20,030
我只想让你知道  这两天
I just want you to know that these last two days

1217
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:23,910
这是我生命中最美好的两天
have been the best two days of my life.

1218
01:12:26,980 --> 01:12:28,650
你也知道  我从来不会把思念挂在嘴边
You know I never though I'd say this

1219
01:12:28,780 --> 01:12:31,290
但我真的会想你的  你这个蓝恶魔
but I'm actually gonna miss you, you little Blue Devil.

1220
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,490
我也会想你的  甜甜圈殿下
I'll miss you too, Donut Lord.

1221
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:35,480
谢谢你
Thank you.

1222
01:12:36,190 --> 01:12:37,470
为什么谢我
For what?

1223
01:12:38,100 --> 01:12:39,680
因为你救了我的命
For saving my life.

1224
01:12:57,670 --> 01:13:00,570
有人开着"查找我的手机"吗
Okay, did someone leave their 'Find my Phone' on?

1225
01:13:26,870 --> 01:13:29,930
欢迎来到旧金山瓦查斯基先生
Welcome to San Francisco, Mr. Wachowski.

1226
01:13:30,610 --> 01:13:32,450
你喜欢吃蛤蜊杂烩吗
Are you enjoying the clam chowder?

1227
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,980
原来一直想杀我们的是为政府打零工的
It's the government wack job who keeps trying to kill us,

1228
01:13:35,100 --> 01:13:36,100
可惜没有得手
unsuccessfully.

1229
01:13:36,330 --> 01:13:38,410
感谢你在去动漫展的路上顺路过来
Nice of you to swing by on your way to Comic-Con.

1230
01:13:38,540 --> 01:13:40,040
是啊  你穿的是什么
Yeah, what are you wearing?

1231
01:13:41,570 --> 01:13:43,050
这是飞行服
It's a flight suit.

1232
01:13:43,230 --> 01:13:45,890
它的设计可以调节我的体温  减少阻力
Designed to modulate my body temperature and reduce drag.

1233
01:13:46,120 --> 01:13:48,010
好吧  但你仍然像个漫展的工作人员
Yeah, and yet you're still are one.

1234
01:13:48,430 --> 01:13:51,280
好样的  托马斯你是在引火烧身
Good one, you are catching fire, Thomas.

1235
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,570
说到火  我看你带了个情人
Oh, and speaking of heat, I see you've taken a lover.

1236
01:13:54,710 --> 01:13:55,440
她有名字吗
Does she have a name,

1237
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:58,270
或者我们要叫她"被伤及的无辜"
or should we just call her 'collateral damage'?

1238
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,690
喂  别乱说话
Hey, watch your mouth!

1239
01:13:59,840 --> 01:14:02,260
除非你想被打得比之前更惨
Unless you want a little more of what I gave you earlier?

1240
01:14:02,390 --> 01:14:03,470
一拳打到他脸上
Punched him in the face.

1241
01:14:03,590 --> 01:14:05,960
你直接一拳打到他脸上  太棒了
Oh, you punched him right in the face. It was awesome.

1242
01:14:06,100 --> 01:14:09,000
闲聊时间结束了  该按下按钮了
The time for talking is over! It's time to push buttons.

1243
01:14:09,130 --> 01:14:10,940
你的会飞的蛋真是让人印象深刻
Your flying eggs are pretty impressive,

1244
01:14:10,940 --> 01:14:11,960
蛋人先生
Mr. Eggman.

1245
01:14:12,190 --> 01:14:14,620
但面对现实吧  你永远抓不到我
But let's face it, you'll never catch me.

1246
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,290
自信
Confidence,

1247
01:14:16,570 --> 01:14:18,850
是智慧的一个愚蠢的替代
a fool's substitute for intelligence.

1248
01:14:26,330 --> 01:14:28,010
这下糟了
That's not good.

1249
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:30,960
索尼克  我知道你有超高的速度
Sonic, I know you got the super speed and everything,

1250
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:31,600
但玛蒂和我
but Maddie and I...

1251
01:14:31,730 --> 01:14:33,870
毫无防御能力  可能会被炸飞
Totally defenseless, probably gonna get blown up?

1252
01:14:33,990 --> 01:14:35,320
差不多是这样
Pretty much, yeah.

1253
01:14:35,870 --> 01:14:38,600
别担心  我知道该怎么做
Don't worry, I know exactly what to do.

1254
01:14:45,790 --> 01:14:47,770
这招我没想到
I was not expecting that.

1255
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:50,040
但我本就想什么都不想
But I was expecting not to expect something,

1256
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,190
所以这不算数
so it doesn't count.

1257
01:15:51,550 --> 01:15:52,800
加油
Come on!

1258
01:15:52,930 --> 01:15:55,130
加油加油
Com... Com... Come on! Come on!

1259
01:16:05,880 --> 01:16:06,700
Green Hills

1260
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:24,080
嗨  汤姆  很高兴你来了
Hi Tom. Glad you're here.

1261
01:16:24,210 --> 01:16:27,430
快来帮忙  老贝西要生产了
Could use some help. Old Bessie is about to give birth.

1262
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:29,440
给我一分钟
Give me a minute.

1263
01:16:32,150 --> 01:16:35,260
我能给你一个天才的建议吗
Can I give you one genius piece of advice?

1264
01:16:35,850 --> 01:16:37,260
不要跑了
Don't run.

1265
01:16:37,400 --> 01:16:39,550
跑只会带来更多痛苦
It'll only hurt more if you do.

1266
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:42,140
并且科学证明  它对你的关节有害
And it's bad for your joints, they proved it.

1267
01:16:42,280 --> 01:16:43,400
好吧  蛋人
All right, Eggman,

1268
01:16:43,400 --> 01:16:46,020
你想要快吗  那就快开始吧
you wanna get fast? Let's get fast.

1269
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:50,660
困难模式开始
The hard way it is.

1270
01:17:09,650 --> 01:17:11,950
顺便说一句  那个左转违章了
That was an illegal left, by the way.

1271
01:17:14,210 --> 01:17:16,040
所以  我们又回到了这里
So, here we are again.

1272
01:17:16,180 --> 01:17:17,900
我们一起经历了那么多
We've been through so much together.

1273
01:17:18,020 --> 01:17:20,640
现在你明白  为什么有个变态机械博士
Now you understand why there's a psychotic robot-doctor

1274
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,910
在追逐一只超音速蓝色刺猬了吧
chasing a super sonic blue hedgehog.

1275
01:17:22,990 --> 01:17:24,260
想知道结局是怎样的吗
Wanna know how it ends?

1276
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:25,680
是啊  我也想知道
Yeah, me too.

1277
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:46,690
怎么可能  从来没人追上过我
How is this possible?! No one's ever caught up to me before.

1278
01:17:54,470 --> 01:17:55,950
我过来了
Coming through!

1279
01:17:58,910 --> 01:18:00,870
请原谅我  先生
Excusez-moi, monsieur.

1280
01:18:04,800 --> 01:18:07,340
有了  有地方可以打开它了
Here we go. Room to open it up.

1281
01:18:16,330 --> 01:18:17,840
我甩不掉他
I can't lose him!

1282
01:18:32,180 --> 01:18:34,760
如果你打不过他  就弄瞎他
If you can't beat him, blind him.

1283
01:18:37,840 --> 01:18:39,850
无法视觉探测
Lost visual contact.

1284
01:18:44,590 --> 01:18:46,640
你不准爬上那里
You're not allowed up there!

1285
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,930
那是世界七大奇迹之一
It's one of the Seven Wonders.

1286
01:19:12,870 --> 01:19:15,150
-快跑  -快点  快点
- Get out of here! - Go! Go!

1287
01:19:22,410 --> 01:19:25,440
你真是个了不起的小东西
You're an astonishing little creature.

1288
01:19:28,100 --> 01:19:30,100
把你带回实验室
It'll be fun to take you back to the lab

1289
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:32,820
进行一系列有创的探索性手术会很有趣的
for a litany of invasive exploratory procedures.

1290
01:19:33,460 --> 01:19:35,770
有什么遗言吗
Any last words?

1291
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,380
呱
Guac.

1292
01:19:37,620 --> 01:19:39,260
我喜欢这个词
I like that word.

1293
01:19:40,190 --> 01:19:42,660
我不用告诉你  有多少科学突破
I don't have to tell you how many scientific breakthroughs

1294
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,170
是通过动物实验实现的
have been made possible by animal testing.

1295
01:19:45,290 --> 01:19:46,640
你太自私了
You're being very selfish.

1296
01:19:46,780 --> 01:19:48,620
-挡我路了  -什么鬼
- Going my way? - What the...

1297
01:19:54,210 --> 01:19:56,380
你以为你是谁
Who the hell do you think you are?!

1298
01:19:59,460 --> 01:20:01,450
我是甜甜圈殿下  你个智障
I'm the Donut Lord, you son of a...

1299
01:20:06,040 --> 01:20:08,170
自动飞行  调整
Autopilot, adjust.

1300
01:20:08,620 --> 01:20:09,780
为什么
Why?

1301
01:20:10,160 --> 01:20:13,350
你为什么要为这东西放弃你的生命
Why would you throw your life away for this thing?

1302
01:20:13,510 --> 01:20:15,050
因此我从不交朋友
That's why I don't have friends.

1303
01:20:15,210 --> 01:20:17,220
不然接下来你就会当上某人的伴郎
Next thing you know, you're somebody's best man,

1304
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:19,090
他们想在城外举行婚礼
they wanna have the wedding out of town.

1305
01:20:19,230 --> 01:20:21,320
好像没人有什么正事可干
Like nobody has anything better to do!

1306
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:23,550
总之  刚才我们说到哪儿了
Anyway, where were we?

1307
01:20:23,740 --> 01:20:24,850
对了
Oh, yes,

1308
01:20:25,020 --> 01:20:26,760
你就快死了
you were about to die.

1309
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,820
你惹的是我们的警长
That's our Sheriff you're messing with.

1310
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:33,810
以及我们的蓝恶魔
And our Blue Devil?

1311
01:20:33,980 --> 01:20:37,010
大家都看到了  它是个真实存在的生物
Who as everyone can see is a very real creature,

1312
01:20:37,390 --> 01:20:40,360
完全不是我胡扯出来的
and not at all invented by me!

1313
01:20:42,530 --> 01:20:44,500
-小心点  -只是  把它挪远一点
- Be careful. - Just... pull it away...

1314
01:20:44,650 --> 01:20:45,840
汤姆
Tom.

1315
01:20:59,140 --> 01:21:01,240
我不想在这里无礼
I don't mean to be indelicate here.

1316
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,850
但有人应该拿些冰来  别让它身体腐烂
But someone should get some ice to keep the body fresh.

1317
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,250
他只是个愚蠢的小外星人
He's just a silly little alien.

1318
01:21:10,480 --> 01:21:12,430
他不属于这里
He didn't belong here!

1319
01:21:13,960 --> 01:21:15,530
那个小外星人
That little alien

1320
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:19,570
比你更懂得做人
knew more about being human than you ever will.

1321
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,230
他叫索尼克
His name was Sonic.

1322
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:24,410
这是他的家
This was his home.

1323
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:26,890
他是我的朋友
And he was my friend.

1324
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:53,180
他是你的了
He's all yours.

1325
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:55,860
大家都退后
Everyone get back!

1326
01:21:59,350 --> 01:22:02,240
我想你拿了属于我的东西
I think you have something that belongs to me.

1327
01:22:12,950 --> 01:22:14,860
这是我的力量
This is my power!

1328
01:22:15,050 --> 01:22:17,460
我再也不会用它逃跑了
And I'm not using it to run away anymore.

1329
01:22:17,640 --> 01:22:20,910
我要用它来保护我的朋友
I'm using it to protect my friends!

1330
01:23:19,440 --> 01:23:20,790
现在你做到了
Now you've done it!

1331
01:23:20,950 --> 01:23:22,100
你猜怎么着  蛋人
Guess what, Eggman,

1332
01:23:22,100 --> 01:23:23,650
我是不会离开地球的
I'm not leaving Earth.

1333
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:25,190
你才是要离开的那个
You are!

1334
01:23:25,330 --> 01:23:26,680
甜甜圈殿下
Donut Lord?

1335
01:24:15,540 --> 01:24:18,290
-我就说你能成功  -是我们能成功
- Told you you got this. - Hey, we got this.

1336
01:24:30,920 --> 01:24:33,550
-这些是你的  -非常感谢
- These belong to you. - Thank you very much.

1337
01:24:34,390 --> 01:24:36,410
不许再把人从楼上推下去了
No more pushing people of the buildings.

1338
01:24:36,580 --> 01:24:38,200
你知道我不能保证
You know I can't promise that.

1339
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,880
你做得很好  太空刺猬
You did pretty good, space hog.

1340
01:24:42,980 --> 01:24:44,380
谢谢夸奖  甜甜圈殿下
Thanks, Donut Lord.

1341
01:24:44,530 --> 01:24:47,360
你得讲讲"甜甜圈殿下"的事
You're gonna have to explain this 'Donut Lord' thing.

1342
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:48,760
不  不好意思
Nope, sorry,

1343
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:50,070
这是我和这小家伙之间的故事  对吗
that's for me and the little guy. Right?

1344
01:24:50,370 --> 01:24:52,360
我们有我们的故事  你有你和
We got our thing, you got your thing with your...

1345
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:54,250
-你妹妹的故事  -天啊  我的妹妹
- sister. - Oh my God, my sister.

1346
01:24:54,410 --> 01:24:56,750
我要更快  我要更快
Gotta go fast. Gotta go fast.

1347
01:24:58,500 --> 01:25:00,560
乔乔  戴上我的智能手环
Jojo, put on my Fitbit.

1348
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:03,170
那样我至少多刷点步数
Then I can at least get some steps.

1349
01:25:03,320 --> 01:25:04,540
我们再也不能回去了
We can never go back there.

1350
01:25:06,030 --> 01:25:06,860
真的不能了吗
I mean, are we?

1351
01:25:09,590 --> 01:25:11,970
因为感觉我们现在就在家
'Cause it kinda feels like we're home right now.

1352
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,190
真的吗
Really?

1353
01:25:15,360 --> 01:25:17,880
我觉得我已经完成了我的清单上
I kinda feel like I checked the 'save the life'

1354
01:25:17,980 --> 01:25:19,440
"拯救生命"的那一项
box off my bucket list.

1355
01:25:22,300 --> 01:25:23,520
现在我只想
Now all I wanna do

1356
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:26,080
和我关心的人共度一生
is to spend my life with the people I care about.

1357
01:25:27,550 --> 01:25:29,610
我想完成那一项
I wanna check that box.

1358
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:31,970
好呀  我喜欢
Okay. I like that.

1359
01:25:32,240 --> 01:25:34,800
好了各位  没什么好看的了
All right, everybody. Nothing to see here.

1360
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,160
散了吧
Disperse.

1361
01:25:36,260 --> 01:25:38,010
只是青山镇普通的一天
Just another ordinary day in Green Hills.

1362
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:39,980
卡尔  我要没收那个电锯

快点  我们走
Come on, let's go!

1364
01:25:42,260 --> 01:25:44,420
你们要表现得好像从没见过一场
You act like you've never seen a fight between

1365
01:25:44,420 --> 01:25:48,530
星际啮齿动物和博士机器人间的战斗
an intergalactic space rodent and a robot with a doctorate.

1366
01:25:57,670 --> 01:25:59,130
你那里的油漆够用吗
You got enough there?

1367
01:25:59,400 --> 01:26:01,460
-够了  包工头先生  -要再来点吗
- Yes, Mr. Manager. - You need any more?

1368

瓦查斯基夫妇吗
Mr. And Mrs. Wachowski?

1370
01:26:16,340 --> 01:26:17,690
有什么事情吗
Yes?

1371
01:26:19,740 --> 01:26:21,840
这里有份政府发来的奖励
A token of appreciation from your government.

1372
01:26:22,010 --> 01:26:25,300
表彰您对最近发生的未发生之事保持沉默
For keeping quiet about recent incidents, which never occurred.

1373
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:31,540
-不知道里面是什么  -修房子的钱吗
- Wonder what it is. - Money to fix the house?

1374

1378
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:42,840
就像你说的"看了就知道了"
The way you said "you'll see"

1379
01:26:43,000 --> 01:26:45,570
让我觉得这比我们说的要好
made me think it was something better than the things we said.

1380
01:26:45,710 --> 01:26:47,930
你试过他们的"吃不完的意面碗"吗
Have you tried their 'Never Ending Pasta Bowl'?

1381
01:26:48,150 --> 01:26:49,780
永远吃不完
It never ends.

1382
01:26:50,000 --> 01:26:51,730

谢谢你  我们很感激你们的好意

我猜罗伯特尼克的档案可以销毁了
Oh, hey, I guess we can close the file on that Robotnik guy, huh?

1385
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,020
他就这么消失了
Just disappeared?

1386
01:27:00,180 --> 01:27:03,120
我很抱歉  但没有这样的人存在
I'm sorry, but, no such person exists,

1387
01:27:03,120 --> 01:27:04,050
也不曾存在过这样的人
or ever has existed.

1388
01:27:05,290 --> 01:27:06,480
我希望那事是真的
I wish that were true.

1389
01:27:06,650 --> 01:27:08,510
你们那件事过后  就再也没有
You haven't by any chance been in contact

1390
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:11,220
和那个外星人的联系了对吗

山姆大叔很想和他聊聊

1393
01:27:17,430 --> 01:27:20,460
你是说那个蓝色的小家伙吗  没有
Oh, you mean the little blue guy? No, no. Nothing.

1394
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:23,650
恐怕我们再也听不到他的消息了
Doubt we'll ever hear from him again.

1395
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:27,190
-很好  -好吧

You know how you get when you're tired, come on.

你说的  我得回我的小窝
You said I have to go back to my cave.

1408
01:27:57,370 --> 01:27:58,040
我们是这么说的
We did.

1409
01:28:13,480 --> 01:28:16,330
天啊  你在开玩笑吧
Oh my... Are you kidding me?

1410
01:28:17,210 --> 01:28:18,860
真不敢相信

还有懒人沙发  不会是真的吧
And the bean bag? No way!

1415
01:28:37,460 --> 01:28:40,050

How did you even get this? How did you get it all over?

1416
01:28:41,040 --> 01:28:42,930

Wait, what are you doing? Stay away from me.

情况如下  一个无人居住的星球
