1
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:09,675
三个火枪手

2
00:01:57,565 --> 00:01:59,275
改编自大仲马的小说
"Based on the novel by Alexandre Dumas".

3
00:02:51,415 --> 00:02:53,475
怎么样!
So!

4
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:02,835
当你再没办法的时候 无论你看见什么
Whatever you see just last your sword when all allow is failed.

5
00:03:06,955 --> 00:03:11,165
- 这帮了我很大的忙 正如你看到的 - 是的 父亲
- It was helped me well, as you can see. - Yes, Father.

6
00:03:11,835 --> 00:03:13,135
- 您为什么不坐一下呢? - 不不不 时间很紧迫了
- why don't you sit down, sir? - no, no, no, time is short.

7
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,465
你要走了
you must be off.

8
00:03:18,245 --> 00:03:19,655
我把我的秘密武器给你
I'm giving you my secret threats.

9
00:03:20,395 --> 00:03:21,835
还给你这1万5千元
I give you also these 15 grands.

10
00:03:22,255 --> 00:03:23,235
还有这个
And this.

11
00:03:23,525 --> 00:03:28,155
你爷爷买了这把剑来对付勒班陀的摩尔人
Your grandfather bought this sword against the Moors in Lepanto.

12
00:03:28,985 --> 00:03:31,975
我曾经也用过它 在国王亨利统治的时候
I'm in some use of it, under the lead of King's Henry.

13
00:03:32,475 --> 00:03:34,255
现在它是你的了
Now it is yours.

14
00:03:36,225 --> 00:03:39,035
它会带你去拜见火枪手的领导者特雷威尔先生
It will introduce you to Mr. Treville who command the king of Musketeers.

15
00:03:40,145 --> 00:03:43,745
你会永远记住它的 我也会
you will remember it well, and me.

16
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:45,825
给你
Here...

17
00:03:49,235 --> 00:03:51,065
我的儿子啊 你快成为一个火枪手了
My son, you are gonna be a Musketeer.

18
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:54,005
你年轻 应该要勇敢 如果你有勇气的话
You are yong you should be brave, and if your guts' strong.

19
00:03:54,255 --> 00:03:55,155
而且你叫达塔尼昂
And the D'Artagnan.

20
00:03:56,365 --> 00:03:58,005
所以 该打的时候就打
So fight whenever you can.

21
00:03:58,735 --> 00:04:00,045
不要屈服于凌辱
Never summit to insalts.

22
00:04:00,445 --> 00:04:04,285
除了国王和红衣主教的
except from the king and the Cardinal Richelieu.

23
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:07,595
要小心红衣主教 因为他是通过国王来统治法国的
Beware of the cardinal, for he rules France through the king.

24
00:04:08,655 --> 00:04:11,275
但是你是为效忠于国王和皇后的人
But you are a King's man and the Queen's.

25
00:04:13,335 --> 00:04:13,985
好了
So...

26
00:04:16,935 --> 00:04:18,805
现在去和你母亲说再见吧
Now go and say goodbye to your mother.

27
00:04:21,705 --> 00:04:22,725
你的膏药在包里
Your balm is in the package.

28
00:04:23,525 --> 00:04:24,735
在你伤口上涂上就好
Rup it in wherever you scratch.

29
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:28,065
我在你的鞋子里面装了轮子
I'm driving the wheels in you shoes well.

30
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:28,865
好的 母亲 再见
Yes, mother, good-bye.

31
00:04:29,555 --> 00:04:30,155
再见 父亲
Good-bye, father.

32
00:04:30,655 --> 00:04:31,305
再见
Bye.

33
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:36,495
不要把马卖了 让它老死吧
Don't sell the horse! Let him die old of its own age.

34
00:04:37,025 --> 00:04:39,035
记得要战斗啊
and fight remember!

35
00:04:40,345 --> 00:04:41,185
保重
Take care!

36
00:04:53,965 --> 00:04:56,395
听话
Come on!

37
00:04:56,685 --> 00:04:57,245
看准了
get on it.

38
00:05:01,975 --> 00:05:03,805
看起来有人骑在一只茶杯上
Sighted there's someone riding above the cup.

39
00:05:07,075 --> 00:05:08,895
好像一块有脚的芝士
That's just a cheese with legs.

40
00:05:12,315 --> 00:05:14,515
如果你笑的话 你最好想想为什么
Think what you have laugh ,sir. And you laugh together.

41
00:05:14,655 --> 00:05:15,825
如果是正在跟我说话
If you speak to me.

42
00:05:16,295 --> 00:05:18,025
如果你不是一个绅士的话 我不会和你说话
If you weren't a gentleman I wouldn't speak to you.

43
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:19,885
我没和谁说话
I was speaking at tuteur.

44
00:05:20,905 --> 00:05:22,925
但是我在和您说话啊
But I'm speaking to you sir.

45
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:27,135
如果你是个男人就转过身来
Turn if you are a man.

46
00:05:27,545 --> 00:05:28,425
让我看看你现在倒是怎么笑
Let me see your laugh now.

47
00:05:29,225 --> 00:05:30,255
啊
Ah.

48
00:05:35,475 --> 00:05:36,695
这人真扯淡
This gascons.

49
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:37,565
你想让我干掉他吗?
Do you like cut his throat?

50
00:05:38,585 --> 00:05:39,055
不
No.

51
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:42,035
他的马给处理掉 让他走吧
But among his ridiculous horse. Let him go.

52
00:05:59,445 --> 00:06:00,475
没时间谈了 我的姑娘
No time to talk, my lady.

53
00:06:00,565 --> 00:06:01,645
红衣主教命令你来英格兰
The cardinal command you to England.

54
00:06:02,025 --> 00:06:03,105
你要让白金汉公爵离开伦敦了
Do you have to let him know the moment.

55
00:06:03,645 --> 00:06:04,205
才让主教知道吗?
till the Buckingham leaves London?

56
00:06:05,045 --> 00:06:05,605
然后呢?
And then?

57
00:06:06,025 --> 00:06:07,475
我等待下一步指示
I'll wait further orders.

58
00:06:08,265 --> 00:06:12,425
你呢?我什么时候才能再见到你?
And you? when do I see you again?

59
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,555
你...你这个刺客
You!You assasin!

60
00:06:15,315 --> 00:06:17,045
我应该把你刺死的
I shall thrust die you, sir.

61
00:06:19,715 --> 00:06:22,425
原谅我 女士 但是我必须把你朋友杀死
Forgive me, madam. But I must kill your friend.

62
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:24,385
噢 你不怕吗?
Oh, you're not terrified?

63
00:06:24,655 --> 00:06:26,715
哈! 走开 白痴
Ha! Away! Pumpkin!

64
00:06:27,245 --> 00:06:28,365
你会等到我消息的
You will hear from me.

65
00:06:28,845 --> 00:06:29,915
他挺帅的
He's very handsome.

66
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:33,315
尽管他有些迟钝
Even though he is bluntness, maybe.

67
00:06:41,175 --> 00:06:42,625
克劳德 付钱吧
Claude, pay the bill.

68
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,795
你...
You...

69
00:07:36,225 --> 00:07:38,555
- 特雷威尔先生在哪儿? - 在楼上 跟我来
- Where is Mr. Treville? - He's upstairs, follow me.

70
00:07:39,055 --> 00:07:39,615
谢谢你
Thank you.

71
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:46,125
你太紧张那个腰带了
You are doing more on belt proper.

72
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,045
我有吗?
I do?

73
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:47,585
是啊
Oh, yes.

74
00:07:47,745 --> 00:07:48,965
我曾经是个喜欢
I used to be a man who must.

75
00:07:49,515 --> 00:07:50,595
每晚花钱在自己的衬衫上的男人
spent his money on fine shirts in the night.

76
00:07:51,035 --> 00:07:51,455
什么?
what?

77
00:07:52,045 --> 00:07:53,175
或者赚他情妇的钱?
or want his mistress' money?

78
00:07:53,225 --> 00:07:55,795
哦 不 阿拉米斯那可是我自己的钱啊
Oh, no, Aramis help me out to get her but my own money.

79
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:58,485
那都是金币啊 那都是小事
all of these are pistoles, oh, this is all trifles.

80
00:07:58,995 --> 00:08:00,495
但是 的确是拿我的金币在床周围围了一圈啊
but it is gold building all the way around the bed.

81
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:01,395
太震惊了
Astonishing!

82
00:08:02,365 --> 00:08:04,005
法国有足够的金子吗?
There is enough gold in France to straight or let her sense.

83
00:08:04,455 --> 00:08:06,945
你介意我在抬起这珍贵的大衣多看一眼这腰带吗?
Mind if I lift the costly coat to admire the belt more?

84
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:09,185
不不不 先生
No, no, no, your pardon, sir.

85
00:08:09,505 --> 00:08:10,215
我感冒了
I have a cold.

86
00:08:11,105 --> 00:08:12,325
自由裁量权都变成虚荣的时尚了
Discretion being a part of vanity.

87
00:08:13,035 --> 00:08:14,345
我不明白
I don't understand.

88
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:16,305
我知道我眉毛很好看
I know the one about valla...

89
00:08:16,785 --> 00:08:18,145
但是我不知道眼神好
but it don't know eye contact will need.

90
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,205
会令眉毛的效果大打折扣
to be discrete half of that in time.

91
00:08:20,395 --> 00:08:21,245
长太帅了就是没办法
shouldn't balost.

92
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:28,515
这剑十分干脆利落
It's very clean the sword dressed.

93
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:32,145
是红衣主教守卫队的纪念品啊 阿多斯先生
a souvenir of the Cardinal's Guard, Mr. Athos.

94
00:08:32,215 --> 00:08:33,715
你是个骗子 真扯淡
You're a liar. That's more ballocks.

95
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,765
当然 你怎么这么快就看出来了?
Of course. Why do you see that immediately?

96
00:08:36,285 --> 00:08:37,415
不要假装在你这里每一个人
Don't pretended one from another.

97
00:08:37,725 --> 00:08:39,315
都得到不同的待遇
or make any difference to a treament if you did.

98
00:08:40,265 --> 00:08:42,345
特雷威尔先生现在要见你了
Mr. Treville will see you now.

99
00:08:42,845 --> 00:08:43,735
啊
Ah.

100
00:08:47,615 --> 00:08:48,415
谢谢你
Thank you.

101
00:09:27,615 --> 00:09:30,665
你老子说你带着他自己的剑吧 达特尼昂先生
Your father says you carried his own sword Mr. D'Artagnan.

102
00:09:31,725 --> 00:09:33,685
是的
Yes.

103
00:09:34,705 --> 00:09:35,355
嗯嗯
Hum hum.

104
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:45,075
哦
Oh.

105
00:09:45,575 --> 00:09:50,345
你可以带着我的家伙 等你的再长长点之前
You may have taking my arm along until yours grows longer.

106
00:09:51,105 --> 00:09:52,545
先生 我不要任何人的怜悯
Sir, I ask charity for no one.

107
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:55,065
那就是说你不会拿 是吧?年轻人
Then you're unlikely to get it. Are you, young man?

108
00:09:57,435 --> 00:09:59,035
不 不是怜悯
No, not charity.

109
00:09:59,565 --> 00:10:02,565
是出于对老友儿子的一点爱和小恩惠
Love and courtesy for the son of an old friend.

110
00:10:03,385 --> 00:10:06,465
让他的敌人在大洋彼岸 哪儿凉快哪儿呆去
to keep his enemies that in shore to far enough.

111
00:10:07,415 --> 00:10:08,765
谢谢您 先生
Thank you, sir.

112
00:10:10,475 --> 00:10:11,075
真谢谢您
I do thank you.

113
00:10:12,715 --> 00:10:15,665
那是我能给你的所有了
That is as much as I can offer you.

114
00:10:16,155 --> 00:10:19,765
你看到了 剑客里面没有空位置安排给你了
You see there is no place in the musketeers.

115
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:22,475
只有你在军队里面服役过
for a man till he has served the campaign.

116
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:25,265
或者在其他的战斗方面立过大功
or other ways distinguishes himself in the killing.

117
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:32,535
但是我还是可以给德拉塞尔先生写封信
But all I can do is write a letter to Mr. De La Salle.

118
00:10:32,735 --> 00:10:35,355
他是守卫的领导人
commander of the guard.

119
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,885
你...你这个懦夫 我鄙视你
You, you coward, I spit on you!

120
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:40,445
什么?
what?

121
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:42,645
哦不 说的不是您
Oh, not on you, sir.

122
00:10:43,515 --> 00:10:44,685
说的是那个独眼龙
on that man without the eye!

123
00:10:45,525 --> 00:10:46,645
你 先生
You, sir.

124
00:10:47,165 --> 00:10:49,695
我让你站住
I said stop sir.

125
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:52,215
呀
Yah.

126
00:10:52,975 --> 00:10:53,955
哦
Oh.

127
00:11:09,445 --> 00:11:10,525
对不起 先生 我赶时间
Excuse me, sir. I'm in a hurry.

128
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:12,525
你当然很赶时间了 年轻人
You are certainly in a hurry, young man.

129
00:11:14,915 --> 00:11:17,065
我的意思是 一句"对不起"是不够的
You heard that I mean to expect the "excuse me" is insufficient.

130
00:11:19,725 --> 00:11:21,415
你需要有人教教你怎么有礼貌
You need a lesson in manners.

131
00:11:21,855 --> 00:11:23,255
我说过"对不起"了
I said "Excuse me".

132
00:11:24,325 --> 00:11:25,535
我不需要有人教我懂礼貌
I need no lesson in manners.

133
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:29,755
无论如何 你还是需要的
You should have one anyway.

134
00:11:30,235 --> 00:11:31,305
哪儿?
Where?

135
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:35,945
12点在加尔默罗女修道会
The Carmelite convent, at twelve.

136
00:11:44,545 --> 00:11:46,505
噢
Oh.

137
00:11:47,605 --> 00:11:48,375
兜兜转转
Go all the way around.

138
00:11:49,345 --> 00:11:49,765
停
Stop!

139
00:11:50,195 --> 00:11:51,655
- 先生 我在跑着呢 - 而且眼睛还瞎了
- Sir, I was running. - And with your eyes shut.

140
00:11:52,425 --> 00:11:55,325
- 先生 您说什么? - 你去中心广场
- Sir, I beg your pardon? - You will come to the Plaza.

即使必须的 但是我也不想动手

但是你还是伤了我的胳膊

- 天啊 我的公爵陛下 - 陛下? - 你是…?
- For god's name, my lord. - My lord? - Are you...?

412
00:36:25,715 --> 00:36:27,255
白金汉公爵
The duke of Buckingham.

413
00:36:28,185 --> 00:36:30,005
现在你知道你破坏了所有事儿了吧
Now do you see you spoil everything.

414
00:36:31,055 --> 00:36:32,975
哦 亲爱的…原谅我吧…我...
Oh, my darling forgive me... I...

415
00:36:34,175 --> 00:36:39,095
哦 陛下 我该说什么好…我…我爱她所以我妒忌
Oh, my lord, what do I say...I...I love her and I was jealous.

416
00:36:39,755 --> 00:36:43,265
这是在黑夜里攻击一个陌生人非常好的原因
Perfectly exellent reason for attacking a stranger in the dark.

417
00:36:44,325 --> 00:36:45,915
您能满足我一个小小的要求吗?
Would you obliged me in a small favour?

418
00:36:46,345 --> 00:36:47,375
任何事都可以 陛下
Anything, my lord.

419
00:36:47,815 --> 00:36:49,875
夫人和我打算去宫殿 并不想被任何人知道
Madam and I are going to the palace means not be seen.

420
00:36:50,615 --> 00:36:52,295
如果有人想跟踪我们
If anyone should try to follow us.

421
00:36:52,405 --> 00:36:54,275
您可以把他杀掉吗?
would you be good enough to kill him?

422
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:55,265
谢谢你
Thank you!

423
00:36:55,875 --> 00:36:57,545
哦 好的…好的
Oh, yes ... yes.

424
00:37:29,865 --> 00:37:34,265
你知道最危险的地方就是最安全的地方吗?
Does your Grace know any private place which is as private as this public one?

425
00:37:34,755 --> 00:37:37,025
- 哦…我… - 在这儿等等 - 什么?
- Well ...I ... - Wait here. - What?

426
00:37:52,475 --> 00:37:55,845
- 安妮… - 你怎么来了? - 来看你啊
- Anne ... - Why have you come? - To see you.

427
00:37:56,755 --> 00:38:00,595
哦 你这个笨蛋!国王怀疑的
Oh, it's foolish! The King suspects.

428
00:38:01,285 --> 00:38:03,395
而且大主教知道的话 你会害了我的
and the cardinal knows, and he'll ruin me if you can.

429
00:38:04,255 --> 00:38:06,735
他派了很多眼线…如果他已经监视到这儿怎么办?
He spies the...what if he caught here?

430
00:38:07,735 --> 00:38:11,715
很明显我们不会被发现 最起码在这个洗衣房里面
Decidedly we must not be found, not with the dirty laundry washed.

431
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:15,355
但是没有希望了 我是国王的妻子了
Oh but it's hopeless. I'm the wife of the king.

432
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:17,605
这个卑鄙的小人
And ill manner little prisey and.

433
00:38:18,295 --> 00:38:19,975
忽略你 同时又嫉妒你
ignores you, and jealous you at the same time.

434
00:38:20,345 --> 00:38:21,365
你欠了他什么?
What do you owe to him?

435
00:38:23,905 --> 00:38:25,255
我欠了他 不能对不起他
I owe to him, not to disgrace him.

436
00:38:26,775 --> 00:38:29,835
这也是为什么我让你走
Which is why I ask you to go.

437
00:38:30,565 --> 00:38:32,835
而且不要回头
And not to return.

438
00:38:34,085 --> 00:38:36,705
- 哦 亲爱的 我们不是一般的人啊 - 的确 我们不是
- Oh, my dear, we're not ordinary folk. - Indeed not.

439
00:38:37,585 --> 00:38:39,235
这也是我们互相彼此伤害到对方的原因
And that's the point and it thrust both ways.

440
00:38:39,915 --> 00:38:43,285
我不是一个绅士或者农民
I'm no little gentleman or farmboy.

441
00:38:44,465 --> 00:38:46,015
我是一国之主啊
I'm the master of the great state there.

442
00:38:47,185 --> 00:38:50,835
这个国家有非常强大的船只和海军 如果你需要我
with great ships and armies too, if you need me.

443
00:38:51,755 --> 00:38:53,725
英国人从前来过法国
The English come to France before.

444
00:38:54,775 --> 00:38:56,455
并没有像我现在拥有过这么充分的理由
A lack of better reason than I have.

445
00:38:57,915 --> 00:39:00,495
你觉得我会因为赢得你而发动战争吗?
You think I will threat for a war to win you?

446
00:39:02,285 --> 00:39:06,785
如果你不信 等着看法国挑起战争吧
If you doubt it, wait till Frances put his to draggle score the English for hell.

447
00:39:08,975 --> 00:39:09,845
亲爱的 亲爱的安妮
Dear, dear Anne ...

448
00:39:12,775 --> 00:39:16,405
你知道 你比任何我在洗衣房里面看到的东西都要美
Do you know, you look lovelier than anything I've seen in the laundry before?

449
00:39:19,445 --> 00:39:22,205
来 再告诉我 你爱我
Come, tell me again that you love me.

450
00:39:26,745 --> 00:39:32,785
你要走了 这里不安全
You must go. It's not safe here.

451
00:39:33,955 --> 00:39:37,375
会有这么一天的 到了那天…
It will be oneday. Until then...

452
00:39:39,015 --> 00:39:43,225
给点东西我留作纪念吧 一枚硬币 什么都可以
give me something to remember you by, a tocken, anything.

453
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:48,385
哦 求你了 你就当施舍给一个小穷孩儿吧
Oh, come, a farm boy, sweetheart you are giving one.

454
00:39:57,275 --> 00:39:58,625
这些就是我最珍贵的东西了
These are my best things.

455
00:40:00,745 --> 00:40:02,705
我一年之内会给你送回来
Within a year I will bring them back to you.

456
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:23,165
哦 她们就是这样洗衣服的 我从来都没有注意过
Oh, that's how they do it. I have no notion.

457
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:27,035
我以后穿衣服该怀着更尊敬的心情
I should wear my shirt in future with more respect.

458
00:40:29,835 --> 00:40:34,095
- 哦 天啊 - 走啊 快点
- Oh, God! - Go on, quickly.

459
00:40:34,595 --> 00:40:36,185
站着别动
Stand still!

460
00:40:50,735 --> 00:40:51,345
在这里面
In here!

461
00:40:57,475 --> 00:40:58,835
在那
There!

462
00:41:02,965 --> 00:41:04,035
不好意思
Excuse me!

463
00:41:18,595 --> 00:41:19,905
请告诉我发生什么事儿了
Please tell me what's going on.

464
00:41:36,275 --> 00:41:36,885
过来
come here!

465
00:42:08,865 --> 00:42:10,445
让我来吧 阁下
My lord, may I?

466
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:14,005
哦谢谢你
Oh, thank you.

467
00:42:22,405 --> 00:42:25,075
来吧!来吧!
Come on! Come on!

468
00:43:31,265 --> 00:43:32,115
哦我的头发
Oh, my hair.

469
00:43:32,665 --> 00:43:34,305
我本来应该是能够应付的
I probably could have managed,

470
00:43:34,555 --> 00:43:35,575
但是我还是得谢谢你们
but I'll thanks you gentlemen anyway.

471
00:43:38,995 --> 00:43:41,895
- 那是谁? - 不知道啊
- And who is that? - I don't know.

472
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:48,465
- 但是他听起来说话很得体是吧? - 是啊
- But he sounded touch, warrant to me didn't he? - Yeah.

473
00:43:53,245 --> 00:43:56,475
哦 天啊 这是怎么回事儿啊?
Oh, dear! What on earth is all about?

474
00:43:59,195 --> 00:44:03,025
- 开始 - 我想跳下去 我什么都没干 我当时就躺床上
- Into go. - I want to jump. I did nothing. I was lying in bed.

475
00:44:06,265 --> 00:44:09,215
我发誓我什么都没干! 他们准备对我怎样?
I swear I have done nothing, nothin! What do they do to me?

476
00:44:09,625 --> 00:44:11,875
使尽手段 你在巴士底狱 你肯定干过坏事
Everything. You're in the Bastille. You must have done something.

477
00:44:13,255 --> 00:44:15,455
你干的可是一级的叛国罪啊
What you have done is high treason.

478
00:44:20,135 --> 00:44:24,395
你被指控串谋你的妻子和白金汉公爵
You are accused of conspiring with your wife and the Duke of Buckingham.

479
00:44:24,935 --> 00:44:26,115
不不不
No, no...

480
00:44:26,845 --> 00:44:28,995
你知道你是原告吗?
You know you are accuser?

481
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:32,805
谁把你带这儿来的?
Who brought you here?

482
00:44:34,955 --> 00:44:38,325
那个 那个男人
That! That is the man!

483
00:44:38,995 --> 00:44:41,145
- 带他走 - 不是那个
- Take him away. - That is not the man.

484
00:44:42,165 --> 00:44:43,995
他是一个非常值得尊敬的绅士
He is a very honorable gentleman.

485
00:44:51,675 --> 00:44:53,735
- 他们碰面了 皇后和白金汉公爵 - 在哪儿?
- They have met, the queen and Buckingham. - Where?

486
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:55,995
在宫殿里面 当我知道的时候已经太迟了
At the palace. I learn of this when it was too late.

487
00:44:56,395 --> 00:44:57,665
你指...他在你指缝中溜走了?
You mean he slipped through your fingers?

488
00:44:58,025 --> 00:45:00,185
事实上是在阁下的指缝中溜走了 我并没有下命令
In fact through your eminence fingers. I have no orders.

489
00:45:00,245 --> 00:45:01,225
发生了什么事?
What happened?

490
00:45:01,465 --> 00:45:03,475
那个叫伯纳修的女人把白金汉公爵带到巴黎了
The woman Bonacieux took Buckingham to the Paris.

491
00:45:03,605 --> 00:45:07,305
伯纳修?我不是告诉你把她带回来吗?
The woman Bonacieux? I thought I told you to arrest him, to hold her.

492
00:45:07,515 --> 00:45:11,115
被她她逃了 失败是常有的事
I failed. when does it occasionally.

493
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:15,415
如果我像你一样笨的话 我早就没命了
If I blunder as you do, my hand would fall.

494
00:45:16,585 --> 00:45:18,455
阁下 我会把您的命看的比我自己的还珍贵
I would safe from greater high than mine eminence.

495
00:45:18,925 --> 00:45:20,295
你会吗?
You would?

496
00:45:20,795 --> 00:45:23,685
- 这是崇高的理想 - 你不怀有吗? - 没有
- The highter volting ambition. - You have none? - No.

497
00:45:26,635 --> 00:45:32,155
- 你害怕我吗?罗什福尔 - 是的 阁下 害怕您
- You fear me, Rochefort? - Yes I fear you, eminence.

498
00:45:34,535 --> 00:45:36,355
而且还恨你
I also hate you.

499
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:42,355
我爱你 我的孩子 即使你失败了
I love you, my son. Even when you fail.

500
00:45:59,305 --> 00:46:02,355
皇后的确把有12颗珍珠的珍珠项链给了白金汉公爵
I do know the queen gave Buckingham the 12 diamond stars.

501
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:04,105
是国王在皇后上一年生日的时候送给她的那条
the king presented to the queen on her last birthday.

502
00:46:04,955 --> 00:46:06,965
当白金汉带着它离开的时候 我还不知道呢
When the Buckingham went after the evidence, I do not notice.

503
00:46:07,245 --> 00:46:09,355
把一切你掌握不到的情况给我列个单子
Bear me a resentation of everything you do not know.

504
00:46:09,785 --> 00:46:11,705
否则在你采取行动时白金汉就到加莱了
or Buckingham will be in Calais before you have done.

505
00:46:17,115 --> 00:46:27,175
不不不 求你了 救命啊
no, no, no, please, help.

506
00:46:32,415 --> 00:46:34,205
哈哈 是个石头
Haha, it's a stone.

507
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:38,285
你欺骗我啊?
You have deceived me?

508
00:46:42,125 --> 00:46:43,105
竟然骗我
Deceived me!

509
00:46:44,155 --> 00:46:48,975
考虑到你是个卖国贼 起来吧 我的朋友
Thinking that you are a traitor, rise, my friend.

510
00:46:50,855 --> 00:46:52,965
我还可以说些什么啊 伯纳修先生
Mr. Bonacieux, what can I say?

511
00:46:53,835 --> 00:46:57,205
我发现我们对你的怀疑实在是太不公平了
I finded our suspicion about you was entirely unjust.

512
00:46:57,815 --> 00:47:02,255
主教握着我的手叫我"朋友"
The Cardinal has taken my hand and called me "friend".

513
00:47:02,485 --> 00:47:04,545
我们应该给你更好的待遇
Oh, we must make you better manage than that.

514
00:47:05,925 --> 00:47:09,115
把这一百个金币拿去吧 原谅我
Take these hundred pistoles and forgive me.

515
00:47:09,765 --> 00:47:12,715
我?原谅您吗?哦您千万别这么说
I? Forgive your Eminence? Oh you can not ring that.

516
00:47:13,175 --> 00:47:15,895
我意思是…我是什么啊?我什么都不是
I mean... what am I? I'm nothing...better...

517
00:47:16,925 --> 00:47:18,095
比无名小卒还低等
less than nothing.

518
00:47:20,785 --> 00:47:23,455
朋友你太慷慨了…好吧
Friend you are generous... well then.

519
00:47:24,445 --> 00:47:29,145
来这儿…我还是希望你能常来
Up here... that I still hope that you would come and.

520
00:47:29,535 --> 00:47:30,375
看看我
visit me again.

521
00:47:30,685 --> 00:47:33,825
那么我们就能一起聊聊天
so that we could talk together until our next meeting.

522
00:47:34,635 --> 00:47:36,835
他说我们可以一起聊聊天
He said that we are going to talk together.

523
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:37,895
这样不好吗?
Isn't that lovely?

524
00:47:39,075 --> 00:47:43,805
我想我下赌注挺大的 突然间从他老婆那儿得到灵感
I think I have done all the gamble, suddenly inspired by his wife.

525
00:47:44,135 --> 00:47:45,875
他没觉得我胆怯吧?
He didn't think I'm frightened, did he?

526
00:47:47,845 --> 00:47:54,165
这个英勇的白金汉公爵 肯定会戴上项链的
the gallant Buckingham will most certainly wear those diamond stars.

527
00:48:04,585 --> 00:48:06,925
马上给在英国的文特尔夫人去个信儿
Send word immediately the Mrs. De Winter, in England.

528
00:48:07,675 --> 00:48:11,285
她和白金汉走挺近的 让她拿俩个钻石来
She used to get close to him, and obtain 2 of the stones.

529
00:48:12,575 --> 00:48:15,385
你去确定一下 让她一拿到就给我
You go there to make sure, see that she bring them to me immediately.

530
00:48:16,325 --> 00:48:19,975
至于她怎么拿到那就是她的事儿了
How she gets them is her affair.

531
00:49:14,265 --> 00:49:16,415
你喜欢这个地方吗?非常便宜
You like this place? It's very cheap.

532
00:49:31,155 --> 00:49:33,505
等等 我可以赢点儿钱的
Wait a minute. I can win some money for us.

533
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:38,075
就是他 买他吧 他会赢的
Ha he's the one. He's the one. He will win.

534
00:49:40,495 --> 00:49:41,995
哦 来吧  孩子 来吧
Oh, come on, dear boy, come on!

535
00:49:42,645 --> 00:49:45,175
那都不够吃饭钱啊
But that's not even enough to pay for dinner.

536
00:50:08,535 --> 00:50:09,845
我饿死了
I'm starving!

537
00:50:23,855 --> 00:50:26,525
来点儿鸡肉吧 星期三鸡肉总是很好的传统
What about some chicken? That's alway popular on Wednesday.

538
00:50:26,865 --> 00:50:28,315
今天是周二啊
It's Tuesday.

539

01:02:00,885 --> 01:02:03,135
他教罗什福尔
He's name is Rochefort.

670
01:02:03,885 --> 01:02:05,945
他是大主教的活武器而且非常致命啊
He's the cardinal's living blade and he's deadly.

671
01:02:06,515 --> 01:02:09,135
你俩能不能跑快点啊? 散步了吧啊?
Will you rambling move your way you ballocks.

672
01:02:14,125 --> 01:02:15,515
十五比零
Fifteen none.

673
01:02:16,055 --> 01:02:17,095
再买十五个
Fifteen more.

674
01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:30,385
十五比四
Fifteen four.

675
01:02:45,455 --> 01:02:46,295
三十比十五
Thirty fifteen.

676
01:02:47,035 --> 01:02:47,965
关于罗什福尔就是这些了
And that's for Rochefort.

677
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,715
如果有一天你在街上看到他迎面走来
If you see him walking at the other side of the road.

678
01:02:50,315 --> 01:02:51,905
就让他经过吧
one day then well let him cross over that's all.

679
01:02:52,905 --> 01:02:55,245
阿拉米斯!扫过那边去
Aramis!Scout over the gate.

680
01:02:59,095 --> 01:03:02,705
- 这是唯一的机会了 - 你去吧
- Your only chance. - You for the galement.

681
01:03:03,145 --> 01:03:05,625
有没有罗什福尔
With Rochefort or no Rochefort.

682
01:03:06,195 --> 01:03:08,015
我都要带着信去伦敦
I have to get to London with this letter.

683
01:03:09,305 --> 01:03:09,675
这是皇后的任务
It's on the queen's business.

684
01:03:10,175 --> 01:03:13,125
14天之后我要带着回复回来巴黎
and I have to return back with an answer within 14 days.

685
01:03:13,675 --> 01:03:16,705
你可能走不出5公里
The cuttings friends hunting you and get 5 miles.

686
01:03:21,105 --> 01:03:23,125
游戏结束了 决赛
Game over and final set.

687
01:03:23,465 --> 01:03:24,865
好样的
Good looking.

688
01:03:26,615 --> 01:03:29,615
- 那就是说你决定要做邮差了 - 嗯
- Say you want to set the deliver. - hmm.

689
01:03:32,925 --> 01:03:35,165
如果我们四个都去的话就有可能成事
What if the four of us go, it should get there.

690
01:03:36,885 --> 01:03:38,285
谢谢你们
Thank you.

691
01:03:38,545 --> 01:03:40,185
给你这是明天晚饭
There you go tomorrow's dinner sir.

692
01:03:41,255 --> 01:03:43,965
我兄弟的工资都押你俩身上了
My brother's wage on the hugo for the paper see that gambling on you two.

693
01:03:44,285 --> 01:03:45,555
收拾收拾东西吧 我们去伦敦
now get your things we're arriving to London.

694
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,465
伦敦?
London?

695
01:03:48,995 --> 01:03:50,265
我有没钱了吗?亲爱的
Well did I being poor again dear?

696
01:03:52,905 --> 01:03:56,715
灵魂已经腐烂了 你们不该继承上帝的国土
Souls has been corrupted. You shall not inherite the kingdom of god.

697
01:03:59,575 --> 01:04:01,215
- 我们什么时候走? - 马上
- When do we leave? - at once.

698
01:04:01,235 --> 01:04:02,495
去哪儿找马?
where should I get our horses?

699
01:04:02,805 --> 01:04:03,875
我们把仆人都辞了
We take out the servants.

700
01:04:04,155 --> 01:04:05,615
一个男人可能不经意泄露自己的秘密
the gentlemen may reveal the secrets by accident.

701
01:04:05,945 --> 01:04:07,205
但是一个仆人会故意把你卖了
The servants invariably sells them.

702
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:08,825
还有一但我们遇上这样的事
On another thing once we meet.

703
01:04:09,375 --> 01:04:10,215
在路上如果我们有一个倒下了
On this road one of us go down.

704
01:04:10,425 --> 01:04:11,275
其他的三个要拿着信继续走
The other three gone with the letter.

705
01:04:11,635 --> 01:04:12,855
其他的人就要抓紧机会逃命 同意吗?
the one to four take his chance, agree?

706
01:04:14,325 --> 01:04:16,055
没有人会问自己的命运吗
No one ask delicate fate.

707
01:04:16,695 --> 01:04:18,375
没有人想知道自己什么时候归天吗?
the calls in which may being expected to die?

708
01:04:18,885 --> 01:04:20,525
当我们打仗的时候 国王给我们原因了吗
When we go on a campaign, does the king give us a reason?

709
01:04:21,015 --> 01:04:23,175
- 他说杀我们就冲 - 好的 好的
- He says fight and you fight. - I do I do.

710
01:04:23,465 --> 01:04:24,875
那么当我们该死的时候我们就接受命运吧
Well let's going to be killed where we told to.

711
01:04:24,945 --> 01:04:26,195
一个人的生活总是要不停解决问题的
His life worth so many questions.

712
01:05:04,525 --> 01:05:05,835
小心那个拿着包的小子
Careful with that bagged boy.

713
01:05:06,215 --> 01:05:07,945
荷兰人肯定会给他超过一年的钱
The dutches will surely pay you more than a year...

714
01:05:09,675 --> 01:05:11,685
我去找她
I'll go for her.

715
01:05:12,185 --> 01:05:15,775
- 愿上帝与你同在 - 哦你也是 在这个阳光普照的早上
- God be with you sir. - Oh and you too, sir on this fine morning.

716
01:05:16,195 --> 01:05:22,005
- 你想喝一杯吗? - 很荣幸 - 你会为大主教干杯吗?
- Will you toast sir? - With pleasure. - will you drink to hell for the cardinal?

717
01:05:22,865 --> 01:05:26,185
呃 非常高兴先生 如果你也可以为国王而干杯
Glad to sir, if you then join me for the to toast of king.

718
01:05:27,635 --> 01:05:29,735
我不认得什么国王 只认得大主教
I recognize no king but the cardinal.

719
01:05:30,695 --> 01:05:32,245
哦你醉了先生
Oh you're drunk sir.

720
01:05:32,735 --> 01:05:35,535
对此只有一个答案
There's only one answer for that.

721
01:05:37,775 --> 01:05:39,735
你要为此付出代价的
You will pay for it now sir if you please.

722
01:05:41,015 --> 01:05:45,785
这些破事儿!干掉这个人然后尽快跟上我们
This is shit folly!Kill the fellow and follow us as soon as you can, will you?

723
01:06:21,415 --> 01:06:22,485
来吧
Come on!

724
01:06:25,925 --> 01:06:27,385
他能行吗?
Would already done, three!

725
01:06:27,575 --> 01:06:29,495
可能安全的很 那个人是醉猫啊
Probably safe enough. The fellow is drunk.

726
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,325
去做祷告足够清醒了
He get sober enough for him to came on god.

727
01:07:14,495 --> 01:07:17,255
该死的!看!毁了我的衣服
Damn you! Look! ruined!

728
01:08:59,585 --> 01:09:01,465
走开!小心!
Go away! Mind out!

729
01:09:02,545 --> 01:09:04,185
来吧
Come on!

730
01:09:05,475 --> 01:09:06,175
来吧
Come on!

731
01:09:39,215 --> 01:09:41,515
来吧来吧
Come on! Come on!

732
01:09:46,555 --> 01:09:47,575
放下
Drop it!

733
01:10:13,985 --> 01:10:16,605
同样的命运可能在前面十公里的地方等着我们
The same fate awaits us perhaps ten miles aheads.

734
01:10:17,405 --> 01:10:19,515
但是至少现在我们还是安全的
But at least we should be safe enough till then.

735
01:10:20,665 --> 01:10:21,325
前进
Forward!

736
01:10:30,295 --> 01:10:31,465
你告诉我
You do tell me.

737
01:10:32,255 --> 01:10:34,725
叛国罪…虽然是叛国罪
Treason...treason it may be.

738
01:10:35,405 --> 01:10:36,675
但是我还是对法国女人的魅力感到折服
But I will maintain the beauty.

739
01:10:36,735 --> 01:10:38,185
法国女人是最迷人的
of French women about of all others.

740
01:10:39,295 --> 01:10:41,865
的确不能听信英国人的花言巧语
We really believe in Englishmen can anyone?

741
01:10:43,345 --> 01:10:45,035
去睡觉吧 菲尔顿
Go to bed, Felton!

742
01:10:47,025 --> 01:10:49,605
漫漫长夜独自斟酌啊
Long period and faces mumping at bed time.

743
01:10:50,845 --> 01:10:52,155
我什么想法都没有
Nothing's given in my mind.

744
01:11:28,355 --> 01:11:30,095
一个都不允许上船
As I can't carry a anyone's hand.

745
01:11:30,495 --> 01:11:32,835
除非你有大主教的通行证
unless you have a pass from the cardinal.

746
01:11:32,995 --> 01:11:34,115
我有啊
I have a pass.

747
01:11:34,535 --> 01:11:37,155
这个早上我能做的只有保证没有人可以离开
All I can do this morning is that no one was leave.

748
01:11:38,005 --> 01:11:39,965
如果没有白金汉公爵的签名的话
without the signiture of the Buckingham.

749
01:11:41,185 --> 01:11:42,735
很好 我一个小时之后回来
Very well I'll be back in one hour.

750
01:11:42,945 --> 01:11:45,385
但是请您多注意一点
But the Register sailed and keep a close watch sir.

751
01:11:45,675 --> 01:11:47,025
不要出现任何错误也不要让任何人离开
any kind of mistakes who are trying to escape.

752
01:12:00,635 --> 01:12:03,075
你可以帮我一个忙 先生
You are on a position to do me a favour, sir.

753
01:12:03,445 --> 01:12:05,225
你口袋里面的那个通行证
That pass you have in your pocket.

754
01:12:05,615 --> 01:12:06,875
如果你把它给我
if you handed over to me now.

755
01:12:06,915 --> 01:12:08,985
那么会给我们双方带来不少方便
it will save us all a great deal of inconvenience.

756
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:12,425
你就是那个骑黄马那个二货
You are the gascon rascal with the yellow horse.

757
01:12:12,575 --> 01:12:14,825
和那几个剑客在街角上吹牛
so bazoo on the street corners with the musketeers.

758
01:12:15,555 --> 01:12:18,375
街角…你措辞不错啊
Street cornors...you have carefully avoid them monsieur.

759
01:12:18,675 --> 01:12:19,385
独眼龙
Cyclops.

760
01:12:20,095 --> 01:12:21,545
你那其他三个同伙呢?
Where are your three accomplices?

761
01:12:22,155 --> 01:12:24,035
他们会做得好得多的
It would have done better ...

762
01:12:34,115 --> 01:12:36,545
我啊 是我
Me, it's me!

763
01:14:06,005 --> 01:14:08,245
别担心 先生 我来了
Don't worry, sir, I'm coming.

764
01:14:26,475 --> 01:14:28,015
来啦
Coming!

765
01:14:35,045 --> 01:14:36,405
我说吧
I told you.

766
01:14:37,695 --> 01:14:40,035
先生 你要死了吗?
Monsieur, are you killed?

767
01:14:40,265 --> 01:14:42,035
还没
Not quite.

768
01:14:44,705 --> 01:14:46,485
就是刺伤了一点点
Just a scratch longer rip.

769
01:14:47,485 --> 01:14:49,695
哦 上天 你对你的子民做了什么?
Oh, father, what you almost did to your son?

770
01:14:51,475 --> 01:14:52,505
他死了吗?
Is he dead?

771
01:14:54,335 --> 01:14:58,495
失去知觉了 先生 我要干掉他吗?
A lost monsieur. No it's only stoned. Should I kill him?

772
01:14:58,615 --> 01:15:02,505
当然不要了 把他手腕绑起来塞住他嘴巴
Certaily not. Just tie his wrist and gag him.

773
01:15:03,155 --> 01:15:05,075
我们给他机会让他血流致死
We give him the chance to bleeding to dead.

774
01:15:05,195 --> 01:15:06,415
但是我们并没有杀了他
But we are not murder him.

775
01:15:11,875 --> 01:15:13,655
但是这个通行证只给一个人过的
But the pass is for only one person.

776
01:15:13,715 --> 01:15:17,325
是一个人啊 这个是仆人
I'm only one person. That is a servant.

777
01:15:18,355 --> 01:15:19,895
我明白了 好吧
I see, alright.

778
01:15:36,285 --> 01:15:37,735
你还好吧
Are you alright?

779
01:15:44,015 --> 01:15:46,495
看!多佛港!
Look! Dover!

780
01:16:15,705 --> 01:16:17,105
好了 这是我的
Alright it's mine.

781
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,395
陛下
My Lord!

782
01:16:46,655 --> 01:16:49,645
哦 是那个善妒的情人啊
So, it's the jealous lover.

783
01:16:50,625 --> 01:16:52,495
你不是准备来英国
I trust you haven't come to England to.

784
01:16:52,785 --> 01:16:54,045
和我再干一架的吧
fast another quarrel on me?

785
01:17:22,295 --> 01:17:25,995
我不认识字
I'm afraid I can not read.

786
01:17:26,555 --> 01:17:28,285
你在路上多久了
How long have you been on the road?

787
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:29,795
六天了 陛下
Six days, my lord.

788
01:17:30,215 --> 01:17:31,575
那么我们要快
Then so we must buzzle.

789
01:17:31,665 --> 01:17:35,405
快点 我们要快啊
Come on Plachet, we must buzzle.

790
01:17:36,505 --> 01:17:39,085
哦 天啊 我已经很快了
Oh, god, I'm buzzling.

791
01:17:40,225 --> 01:17:42,375
快点 先生 让马儿跑起来
Come, sir! At the gallop!

792
01:18:04,945 --> 01:18:06,675
一 二…
One, two ...

793
01:19:07,055 --> 01:19:08,275
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

794
01:19:08,475 --> 01:19:09,925
她是我的女神
She is my dearty.

795
01:19:12,735 --> 01:19:14,295
给你项链
Here they are.

796
01:19:15,315 --> 01:19:17,795
我还想永远留下它
I hope to keep them always.

797
01:19:18,535 --> 01:19:21,475
天啊 两颗钻不见了!
God, in heaven! There are two of them missing.

798
01:19:21,975 --> 01:19:23,525
- 不见了?为什么? - 别激动 让我想想
- Missing? Why? - Right away, let me think.

799
01:19:24,555 --> 01:19:26,335
两周以前的舞会上 12颗还完好无损
I hold 12 of them in the ball two weeks ago.

800
01:19:28,355 --> 01:19:30,095
文特尔伯爵夫人
The Countess de Winter.

801
01:19:30,885 --> 01:19:31,865
我的天
My God!

802
01:19:32,465 --> 01:19:34,715
无神论者美丽的代价
It's a pretty price to pay for infidelity.

803
01:19:35,375 --> 01:19:37,945
她现在肯定已经在法国了
She would be in France by now.

804
01:19:39,145 --> 01:19:39,835
菲尔顿
Felton!

805
01:19:53,735 --> 01:19:56,025
- 被偷了? - 被大主教的间谍偷了
- They have been stolen? - By cardinal spy!

806
01:19:56,415 --> 01:19:57,355
法式麻烦

807
01:19:58,115 --> 01:20:00,075
菲尔顿 我的秘书 我要起一份命令
Felton, my secretary. I want an ordering.

808
01:20:00,835 --> 01:20:02,565
- 有人还有钢笔吗? - 有支铅笔
- Someone got a pen? - Got a pencil.

809
01:20:03,025 --> 01:20:04,475
写个命令给海峡港口
Write an ordering saying to the channel ports.

810
01:20:04,815 --> 01:20:06,225
没我同意任何船只不得离开港口
No vessels is to sail without my agree.

811
01:20:06,765 --> 01:20:07,595
如果国王问起

812
01:20:07,935 --> 01:20:09,485
就说我正在筹备对法开战

813
01:20:10,025 --> 01:20:11,325
然后清开这里到多佛的路段
And keep the road to Dover clear.

814
01:20:11,885 --> 01:20:13,105
六天了 对吧?

815
01:20:14,545 --> 01:20:16,275
你要尽你所能把项链还回去

816

而且要准时及时

817
01:20:17,805 --> 01:20:19,255
但是…那两颗不见了的呢?
But ...the missing ones?

818
01:20:20,095 --> 01:20:21,965
欧赖利 给这些估估价
O'Reilly, put a price on these.

819
01:20:22,415 --> 01:20:23,545
一个值多少钱
Each one they worth.

820
01:20:28,125 --> 01:20:32,065
不是英国货
Not English, not English.

821
01:20:32,725 --> 01:20:37,025
我认为…500镑吧
I'd say er...500 pounds.

822
01:20:37,095 --> 01:20:38,645
做两个这样的要多久
How long to make 2 of them?

823
01:20:43,915 --> 01:20:44,535
一个星期?
A week?

824
01:20:45,375 --> 01:20:46,585
我给你5000镑一个
I'll pay you 5, 000 pounds each.

825
01:20:47,215 --> 01:20:48,105
如果你能在后天完成的话
if they are finished the day after tomorrow.

826
01:20:48,665 --> 01:20:52,075
成交!你可以去给我妻子传达一声我不回家睡觉了吗
Done! Could I invite to my wife that I won't be coming home?

827
01:20:52,715 --> 01:20:54,425
我会办的更妥的 杰克逊
I'll do better than that, Jackson.

828
01:20:55,415 --> 01:20:56,915
派一辆马车去欧赖利夫人那儿

829
01:20:57,125 --> 01:20:58,905
把她接过来 给她准备一间房间

830
01:20:59,195 --> 01:21:00,635
哦 这么好啊

831
01:21:12,665 --> 01:21:15,665
- 你受伤了吗? - 没什么
- Have you hurt yourself? - It's nothing.

832
01:21:37,635 --> 01:21:40,585
漂亮啊 漂亮啊
Beautiful, beautiful.

833
01:21:43,205 --> 01:21:45,975
如果我说他们和你的眼睛非常般配 是不是恭维呢?
Will you be a compliment to say if they match your eyes?

834
01:21:46,085 --> 01:21:47,485
这么恭维真是太阳从西边出来了
Unusual gallantry.

835
01:21:48,125 --> 01:21:50,645
你一般的幽默感和我的真心能相提并论啊
Your normal humor will be compared them to my heart.

836
01:21:51,005 --> 01:21:52,215
真够犀利的讽刺
a delicate mean.

837
01:21:52,935 --> 01:21:56,965
上面是大主教 下面是皇后
up cardinal, down queen.

838
01:22:22,495 --> 01:22:23,995
我们快点
We move fast.

839
01:22:24,975 --> 01:22:28,055
试一下 把欧赖利做的两个新的找出来
There sir, the cast O'Reilly's 2 new ones if you can.

840
01:22:31,245 --> 01:22:34,425
现在 以我们都在为之服务的伟大的女士的名义
Now, for the honor of the great lady who we both serve.

841
01:22:35,365 --> 01:22:37,655
以下把这项链及时归还的任务就交给你了
It's for you to see that you receive them in time.

842
01:22:37,935 --> 01:22:40,505
- 以我们赖以为生的后土之名 - 那你呢先生
- Where all we just stand on living. - And you, sir ...

843
01:22:41,335 --> 01:22:43,015
我该怎么报答你?
How can I ever repay you?

844
01:22:45,355 --> 01:22:47,135
陛下 让我们彼此都搞清楚
My lord, let us understand one and other.

845
01:22:47,255 --> 01:22:49,495
你是英国人 而且你是法国的敌人
You are an English man, and an enemy of France.

846
01:22:50,385 --> 01:22:51,655
你不欠我什么
You owe me nothing.

847
01:22:52,265 --> 01:22:53,985
但是我所做的一切都是为了皇后
but what I've done I've done for the queen.

848
01:22:54,565 --> 01:22:57,005
和那个对我来说和皇后对于你一样重要的女人
and for another who is as dear to me as the queen to you.

849
01:22:58,165 --> 01:22:59,285
我自愿付出的
I'll take my lieber.

850
01:23:09,745 --> 01:23:12,975
请您原谅 我刚忘记英国是个岛
Your raises pardon, I had forgotten England is an island.

851
01:23:13,025 --> 01:23:14,895
我怎么过岸?
How do I get off?

852
01:23:15,075 --> 01:23:18,105
你会在看到马 在旧丹佛港有船在那里等着
You will find ride horses at the clear old Dover where there is a ship waiting.

853
01:23:20,525 --> 01:23:25,255
先生 就算是朋友的回报你也不愿意接受吗?
Monsieur, you will take no reward from a friend?

854
01:23:27,405 --> 01:23:33,585
你起码收下这个…和敌人给的这个
Will you at least accept this...and this from an enemy?

855
01:23:35,535 --> 01:23:36,815
那就不同了
That is different.

856
01:23:43,915 --> 01:23:45,885
- 我很累啊 - 我也是!我们快到了
- I'm tired. - So am I. We're almost there.

857
01:23:46,425 --> 01:23:48,955
- 但是我很浑身酸痛 - 哦 拜托 练练你的腰吧
- But I am sore. - Oh, come on, put your back in drill.

858
01:23:50,605 --> 01:23:51,495
要起火了
I got fire.

859
01:24:00,395 --> 01:24:03,395
- 我们要换马了 - 认得这个地方吗?
- We need to change horses. - Recognize this place?

860
01:24:03,885 --> 01:24:06,795
这是最后一个我们都活着的地方
The last place on earth when we all alive together.

861
01:24:08,665 --> 01:24:10,345
到我们相聚的日子
Till we meet again my friends.

862
01:24:12,265 --> 01:24:13,335
离那儿已经不远了
Will not be long.

863
01:25:04,135 --> 01:25:06,155
绳子啊 快点

864
01:25:15,425 --> 01:25:17,435
马啊
The horse.

865
01:25:19,615 --> 01:25:21,625
你握住啊老天啊 你在哪儿
Hold on for god's sake. Where are you?

866
01:25:22,225 --> 01:25:23,535
- 拉啊看门的 拉啊!- 快点儿啊
- Pull it gate man pull it!- Quickly!

867
01:25:27,125 --> 01:25:28,525
他们估计要累趴下了
They probably sit down!

868
01:25:30,445 --> 01:25:31,145
啊哈!
Ah ha!

869
01:25:39,195 --> 01:25:40,135
是时候了
It's about time.

870
01:25:42,055 --> 01:25:42,665

- Come on, come on! - Show off! - Why are you alway lefting behind?

872
01:25:50,765 --> 01:25:54,025
- 你听到那个声音了吗? - 那坑爹的口音
- Did you hear that voice? - That unfortunate accent!

873
01:25:54,365 --> 01:25:57,225
兄弟同心 其利断金!
All for one and one for all!

874
01:26:04,175 --> 01:26:05,345
我妻子就在里面
My wife is in there then.

875
01:26:05,835 --> 01:26:06,815
他和所有重要的人跳舞
She dance with all the best people.

876
01:26:07,775 --> 01:26:09,355
有时候向我招招手
And sometimes she waves at me.

877
01:26:10,205 --> 01:26:11,285
有时候也和我跳舞
sometimes she dance with me.

878
01:27:03,595 --> 01:27:07,155
夫人 为什么你不戴钻石项链呢?
Madam, why you are not wearing the diamond stars?

879
01:27:07,575 --> 01:27:09,635
你知道我特别想看看这条项链
You knew I particularly wants to see them.

880
01:27:11,575 --> 01:27:16,375
陛下 这么多人我怕会不见了
Majesty, in this big crowd I fear that I might lose them.

881
01:27:17,405 --> 01:27:20,305
你错了 我就是给你这个礼物让你…让你…
You are wrong. I made you this present to...to...

882
01:27:20,715 --> 01:27:21,605
供自己瞻仰
to adore youself.

883
01:27:23,035 --> 01:27:24,725
我真是非常不满意
I'm highly displeased.

884
01:27:26,665 --> 01:27:32,125
如果陛下你喜欢的 我可以让人马上送到宫殿来
If your Majesty pleases, I can send to the palace for them.

885
01:27:34,035 --> 01:27:36,285
好吧…马上送来
Do so...and immediately.

886
01:27:48,835 --> 01:27:51,045
继续吧 雷吉 满上
Go ahead, Reggie, filling up.

887
01:27:52,755 --> 01:27:54,685
我正尽力 我正给你满上
I'm doing my best, and I'm filling up.

888
01:27:55,305 --> 01:27:56,375
他正走向我呢
He's coming over to me now.

889

- 他不喜欢吃那个 他吃了吗? - 是的
- Not his have for one a mind! Did he take...? - Yes.

890
01:28:09,015 --> 01:28:11,115
皇后看上去很苍白
Her Majesty is really pale, I thought, sire?

891
01:28:13,465 --> 01:28:15,655
我可以稍微把您的注意力吸引过来
May I respectly direct your Majesty's attention to.

892
01:28:15,855 --> 01:28:17,175
到盒子里的甜点上吗
to this sweets in this box.

893
01:28:19,075 --> 01:28:21,055
我肯定你会非常感兴趣
I feel sure you will agree there are a royal confession.

894
01:28:24,845 --> 01:28:26,115
什么意思?
What does this mean?

895
01:28:26,385 --> 01:28:29,375
没什么 如果皇后有项链
Nothing. Only if the queen has the stars.

896
01:28:29,605 --> 01:28:30,685
我就非常疑惑了
which I have very much doubt.

897
01:28:31,305 --> 01:28:34,255
数数项链里的钻石数 你应该只能数到10个
Count them sire, if you should find only 10.

898
01:28:34,605 --> 01:28:36,995
问问她剩下的两个怎么回事吧
ask her Majesty what could possibly happen to the other 2.

899
01:28:49,055 --> 01:28:52,985
我告诉你…如果没有正式邀请函没有人可以进去
I told you... No one, no one may enter without a proper invitation.

900
01:28:53,545 --> 01:28:54,715
这是主教的命令
It's the cardinal's order.

901
01:28:56,865 --> 01:29:05,005
- 您在说一遍 - 我说… - 不用说了
- I beg your pardon, sir? - I said... - It doesn't matter.

902
01:29:22,535 --> 01:29:25,005
加油 就是这样 加油 再来一次
Come on, that's it!Come on!Again!

903
01:29:26,845 --> 01:29:29,595
就是这样!再来一次
That's it! Again.

904
01:29:42,185 --> 01:29:44,475
哦夫人 他还是可能会来的
Oh madam, he may still come!

905
01:29:46,425 --> 01:29:47,135
我确定他会来
I feel sure he will.

906
01:29:48,995 --> 01:29:50,075
怎么会呢 康斯坦丝
How can he, Constance?

907
01:29:51,995 --> 01:29:54,345
没用的 结束了
It's no use. It's over.

908
01:30:00,125 --> 01:30:02,465
我会吐的 慢点
I'm gonna be sick, slow down!

909
01:30:33,185 --> 01:30:34,825
那肯定是康斯坦丝
It has to be Constance.

910
01:30:38,415 --> 01:30:40,845
听到小号声就放烟花
Remember light the firework when you hear the trump.

911
01:30:41,085 --> 01:30:43,055
听到小号声就放烟花
Remember light the firework when you hear the trump.

912
01:30:43,275 --> 01:30:43,975

913
01:31:38,715 --> 01:31:39,415

914
01:31:46,035 --> 01:31:47,915
- 达特尼昂! - 什么?

915
01:31:49,735 --> 01:31:50,435
哦!
Oh!

916
01:32:01,155 --> 01:32:03,495
别担心康斯坦丝我快到了
Don't worry Constance I'm almost there.

917
01:32:05,435 --> 01:32:06,165
下来

918
01:32:12,015 --> 01:32:12,485

你们怎么停下来了
Oh why are you stopping gentlemen?

920
01:35:33,675 --> 01:35:34,515
请让一让?

921
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:48,425
守卫!拦住他!跟着熊

922
01:35:56,605 --> 01:35:57,685
我们是老朋友了
We are old friends!

923
01:36:01,255 --> 01:36:02,845
你们都来拯救我了
You all come to rescue me.

01:36:27,435 --> 01:36:28,835
谢谢老天你们都还活着
Thank God you are alive!

925
01:36:29,065 --> 01:36:30,235
做的真好
Well done!

926
01:36:32,165 --> 01:36:33,475
你们能帮我上去吗
Can you get me up there?

927
01:36:38,935 --> 01:36:39,825

942
01:39:40,645 --> 01:39:43,275
14个?13 14…
14? 13...14...

943
01:39:43,765 --> 01:39:44,885
大主教 这是怎么回事儿
What does it mean cardinal?

944
01:39:44,985 --> 01:39:47,925
事实是…陛下
It means...sire.

945
01:39:48,035 --> 01:39:52,065
我想把这两颗钻石送给皇后殿下
that I wished to present those stars to her Majesty.

946
01:39:53,205 --> 01:39:55,135
但是又不敢自己送
and not daring myself to walk with them.

947
01:39:55,265 --> 01:39:58,025
我把它们通过您来给皇后
I gave them to her through you.

948
01:39:58,265 --> 01:40:00,095
哦 我真是太受宠若惊了主教
I'm terribly grateful, your Eminence.

949
01:40:00,975 --> 01:40:03,275
我肯定这两颗钻石比其他的十二个
I'm certain these 2 stars cost you.

950
01:40:03,735 --> 01:40:05,715
都贵得多啊
much more than the other 12 of course.

951
01:40:05,735 --> 01:40:06,995
你说是不是?陛下
isn't that, majesty?

952
01:40:15,795 --> 01:40:18,085
阁下 达特尼昂设法进来舞会了
Eminence, D'Artagnan gained entry to the halltail.

953
01:40:18,405 --> 01:40:19,115
的确是 我看出来了
Quite so.

954
01:40:19,245 --> 01:40:20,835
你失败了 我也输了
You fail, and I lost.

955
01:40:21,965 --> 01:40:24,115
在这个游戏中输了分数 您继续吧
I lost the point to the game, continue.

956
01:40:24,625 --> 01:40:28,235
我们不把这个有勇无谋的小子找出来吗
we are not seeking him out, this boy, who is out of wititute.

957
01:40:28,685 --> 01:40:31,765
找出来干什么?报仇吗?真是太奢侈的事
To what end? Revenge? That is an expensive luxury.

958
01:40:32,375 --> 01:40:34,575
政治家也支付不起这样的损失啊
Statesmen can not afford it.

959
01:40:34,755 --> 01:40:36,675
不用 我可以利用这个人
No, I could use such a man.

960
01:40:37,215 --> 01:40:38,995
也许我还是得把他找出来
perhaps I shall seek him out afterall.

961
01:40:40,955 --> 01:40:43,955
阁下您是一个玩游戏的行家 输得起
Your Eminence is a great player, great enough to lose.

962
01:40:44,435 --> 01:40:46,075
但是我不喜欢输
I do not like to lose.

963
01:40:46,855 --> 01:40:48,865
那您就做自己想做的事情吧夫人
You must suit yourself, my lady.

964
01:40:49,815 --> 01:40:50,885
即使最后还是输了
For even in the end you should.

965
01:40:51,505 --> 01:40:53,275
也要输得漂亮
do it and becoming grace.

966
01:41:01,395 --> 01:41:03,835
我的心肝宝贝啊
Oh my darling darling darling.

967
01:41:05,775 --> 01:41:08,185
我再也不会让你在外面这么危险的地方闯荡了
Never again will I let you go in such terrible danger.

968
01:41:08,985 --> 01:41:13,005
哦 奔驰 挣扎 打架 战斗 那都是什么?
Oh, gallops, struggles, stemmish, frustos, too. What is that?

969
01:41:13,985 --> 01:41:14,595
那都是一天的生活啊
It's a day's work.

970
01:41:16,505 --> 01:41:18,385
但是最终能找到我心爱的美丽的康斯坦丝
but to find my beautiful Constance till the end.

971
01:41:19,725 --> 01:41:20,655
你想我吗?
Did you miss me?

972
01:41:23,115 --> 01:41:25,595
这真是一个蠢问题
A foolish question.

973
01:42:40,595 --> 01:42:41,535
我帮他干活
I work for him!

974
01:42:44,335 --> 01:42:47,375
年轻人 你现在是个火枪手了
Well young Gascon, now you are a musketeer.

975
01:43:01,655 --> 01:43:04,045
都拿着国王的步枪
Carrying the king's muskets with honor.

976
01:43:04,575 --> 01:43:07,485
现在你们是四个火枪手
Now you are the four musketeers.

977
01:43:30,345 --> 01:43:31,005
现在我们是四个了
Now we are four.

978
01:43:33,105 --> 01:43:36,425
我的老板!他正向你招手呢
My boss! He's waving to you!

979
01:43:37,785 --> 01:43:39,145
现在我们整整齐齐的 别弄丢了
And there we are all. Don't drop it!

980
01:43:42,575 --> 01:43:43,225
向国王致意
Oh, the king!
