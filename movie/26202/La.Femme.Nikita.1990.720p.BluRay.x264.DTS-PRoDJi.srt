罪名成立
law enforcement agents killed in the line of duty.

62
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:10,540
被告减刑的申诉缺乏正当的理由
As to the question of extenuating circumstances...

我们已经通知她了
She's been informed.

79
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,850
难道她不愿见我最后一面吗
But isn't she supposed to be with me?

80
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:35,560
我现在想要我的妈妈
Please try. I must see Mama.

81
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:43,360
你们一定搞错了
Maybe this whole thing is a big mistake.

82
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:45,950
她会见我的 她会来找我的

That's quite a pretty name.

89
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:29,870

99
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:37,480

118
00:18:59,810 --> 00:19:04,300
那我叫你脑袋开花

123
00:19:41,140 --> 00:19:43,550
我第一个弹仓是不上弹的
I always leave the first chamber empty.

124
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:49,970
你应该安分几天了
That ought to clip your wings for a while.

125
00:20:28,690 --> 00:20:30,850
你想好了没有
Have you made up your mind?

126
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:37,900
很好
That's fine.

127
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,450
在这里签名
Forms for you to sign.

128
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:55,880

你会行的
You can make it.

130
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,970
我们从最基本的开始吧
I'm going to start you with a fairly easy program.

131
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:15,150
它像打字机的输入资料键盘
这上面是字母和数字
It's like a typewriter keyboard exactly. It's got letters and numbers.

132
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,230
再看这个 这个是鼠标 下面有个小滚轮
That's the mouse. There's a small roller underneath.

133
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,440
移动你的鼠标
彩显画面的箭头就会跟着你移动
When you move it there, it moves the arrow on the screen.

134
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:24,820
你按鼠标的左键就可以画图 它还可以选曲
Good. If you press it, you can make images, drawings.

135
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,490
你可以试一试
Try it.

136
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,580
哎 对对对 太快了 太快了
There you go. Easy. Too fast, too fast.

137
00:21:30,630 --> 00:21:32,450
太快了 慢一点 对 慢一点
哎 不行 不行
That's too fast. Wait a minute.

138
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,790
把鼠标移到左上角 然后回来
Now, bring up the arrow back here, back in the corner right over here.

139
00:21:35,930 --> 00:21:38,420
对 你看 回到这里来
Go on. Bring it back in the corner right here.

140
00:21:39,970 --> 00:21:42,010
很好 你现在按这边
That's fine. Now, you press here.

141
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,840
很好玩
Very good.

142
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,930
再来
Again.

143
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:58,310
这些是一般常用的家伙
These are the firearms we generally use.

144
00:21:58,370 --> 00:22:02,030
我们从最简单的开始
Let's start with the simplest weapon... Beretta 93R.

145
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,860
9厘米自动手枪 20发弹夹
Nine millimeter, Parabellum, 20-round clip.

146
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,490
你别小看它的威力
Never underrate a fatal weapon.

147
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:13,000
在我表明射击位置之前
Before I demonstrate the firing position...

148
00:22:13,090 --> 00:22:15,370
你来熟悉一下这把枪
I want you to be familiar with this beast.

149
00:22:15,470 --> 00:22:16,830
来个10米靶
Mark at ten meters.

150
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:41,360
你用过这种枪
You shot one before.

151
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:44,490
没打过纸靶
Never on paper.

152
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:47,490
八，九，十
Eight, nine, ten.

153
00:23:04,730 --> 00:23:06,760
好 下一个
Keep it nice and round.

154
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:08,300
好
Okay.

155
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:13,980
该你了
我腿有伤
You're up. Let's go. My leg's bothering me.

156
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:17,650
没关系 试试你的反应 
No problem. We'll just test your reflexes.

157
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,780
很简单
It's very simple.

158
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:33,830
好 就位
In position.

159
00:23:41,890 --> 00:23:45,340
我会保持防御的
I'll maintain a defensive stance...

160
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:48,350
你来试着攻击我的头部
and you will try to hit me in the face.

161
00:24:03,370 --> 00:24:05,240
下一个
Next one up.

162
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:28,580
坐吧
Sit down there.

163
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,600
我的小天使 看来你不怎么样
My dear girl, right now you don't really look like much.

164
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:52,270
口香糖吐掉
Chewing gum.

165
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:56,060
不过如果
你肯和我一起努力的话
But if our efforts are repeated in mutual...

166
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,610
上帝帮忙
and if God smiles upon us...

167
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,530
我们可以把你变成一个象样的女人
we will then be able to make you look like a human being...

168
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:05,780
不过一个最重要的认识就是
a step, an intermediate one, but necessary...

169
00:26:05,790 --> 00:26:09,370
男人需要的 渴望的是...
before we have what's essential to a man...

170
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:11,490
女人
a woman.

171
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:26,720
你愉快吗 
Are you pleased?

172
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,690
你认为什么是优雅呢
How about giving me your definition of grace?

173
00:26:36,450 --> 00:26:38,110
我可粗得很
It would sound silly.

174
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,400
也许吧 你可以多一些微笑
Maybe so, then at least you should smile more.

175
00:26:41,490 --> 00:26:44,240
当你来不及反应时 你就一直得保持这样
You've always got that when you can't respond.

176
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:46,240
微笑不能使你更聪明
It won't make you more intelligent...

177
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,120
但是可使看着你的人更愉快
but it's more enjoyable for those who have to watch.

178
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,080
微笑很简单 也很脆弱
And if you have it...

179
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:58,590
有时候会给你带来扭转乾坤的效果
perhaps its fragility gives my girl an advantage.

180
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,550
微笑吧
A smile.

181
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,220
自然点
A smile...

182
00:27:07,310 --> 00:27:11,760
从灵魂里发出的微笑
and soon you'll have its power...

183
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:19,440
你会领悟它的威力的
as if from your very soul.

184
00:27:48,230 --> 00:27:50,760
来试试假发吧
Shall we fix up the wig?

185
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,960
学习的如何
It's been going all right?

186
00:28:14,090 --> 00:28:16,540
不如死了算了
I wish it were gone already.

187
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:18,880
你有幽默感了 小姐
We've acquired a sense of humor. That's very promising.

188
00:28:26,230 --> 00:28:30,220
有没有认识朋友
我离不开玩鼠标
You friends with anybody? Yeah, I'm in real tight with my mouse.

189
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:39,150
能找个酒吧去喝一杯吗
How about a drink at a bar somewhere?

190
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,610
没到时候
Not just yet.

191
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:46,490
这鬼地方不放假的吗
Don't we ever get any rest in this factory?

192
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,030
不放
Never.

193
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:49,870
假发不错
The wig becomes you.

194
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:58,290
下星期日是我的生日
Next week I'll be 20 years old.

195
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,340
难道不能放我个周末假吗
What about giving me a pass for just the weekend?

196
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,890
可以派人跟着我
Have me followed?

197
00:29:49,810 --> 00:29:52,640
你好 我正在设计一个程序
How are ya? I got a program to die for.

198
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,730
你来的正好
I'm glad you're here.

199
00:29:58,740 --> 00:29:59,900
给你
For you.

200
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,450
哦 可以打开吗
May I open it?

201
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:22,050
一只白老鼠 放在盒子里
Had a mouse named Isher and I loved Isher

202
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:27,010
胆小如鼠的你 吓的汗毛直竖
Then I found a fellow who had a face like Isher did

203
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:33,810
伸直！就这样 伸直 好
Stretch! That's it. Stretch it out. Good.

204
00:30:33,860 --> 00:30:36,310
现在转身向前
Now back and forward.

205
00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,530
左腿迈出
Bring the left leg forward.

206
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:33,700
两个月了
她还是只会找麻烦
Yeah, for two months she's been nothing but trouble.

207
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,330
看来你失败了
You picked up a failure.

208
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:37,710
她的潜力很好
She has enormous potential.

209
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,460
什么潜力
What potential?

210
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,840
除了发脾气咬人以外
Up till now, except for temper tantrums and biting instructors...

211
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:44,220
你告诉我她还学会什么了
you tell me what she's capable of.

212
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:47,090
高手总要长期培养的
The best ones always take more training time.

213
00:31:47,270 --> 00:31:49,390
也许需要好几年的时间  
Six, seven years sometimes.

214
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,560
算了吧
Oh, come on.

215
00:31:51,610 --> 00:31:54,890
给你两个星期证明她有能力
You've got two weeks for her to show any progress...

216
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:57,310
否则就只有把她结束掉
or that will be the end of her.

217
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:08,530
我认不出你是谁
But who are you? I don't know.

218
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:13,290
等等 你是...对了
Wait. Wait. You are... Yes.

219
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,210
为什么你拥在我怀中，亲爱的？ 你说呢？
Why are you in my arms, my darling? I don't know.

220
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:20,500
但现在太迟了
But it's too late now.

221
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:26,010
毕竟，也许它只是一个梦想
After all, maybe it's only a dream.

222
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:31,810
噢，我的爱
Oh, my love.

223
00:32:36,570 --> 00:32:40,690
你进步不小啊 在乱跳乱蹦
You've made a lot of progress, mainly in dance...

224
00:32:41,780 --> 00:32:43,900
和乱涂乱画方面
and also in painting.

225
00:32:45,080 --> 00:32:47,320
但在其它的科目
But in all the other subjects...

226
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:53,750
你是零
nothing, zilch...

227
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,330
零蛋 懂吗
zero.

228
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,460
好 你等我一下
Wait for me.

229
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:22,980
生日快乐
For your birthday.

230
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,660
吹呀
Go ahead.

231
00:34:07,710 --> 00:34:10,030
我们有两周来证明你值得栽培
We have two weeks to prove you're worthy, Nikita.

232
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:14,410
如果失败了 我也无法救你
After that, there's nothing more I can do for you.

233
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,870
你会完蛋的
Nothing at all.

234
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,080
你在看我的手
It's my hands you're looking at?

235
00:36:15,210 --> 00:36:18,170
它们曾经很美
They were pretty once...

236
00:36:18,220 --> 00:36:20,420
过去的事了
but that's the past.

237
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,090
你也曾经象我一样
You were like me before?

238
00:37:00,430 --> 00:37:03,250
和你自己谈心吧
Let go and you'll find what pleases.

239
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:06,630
发掘女人的美和魅力
The pleasure of the feminine.

240
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,140
记住 
And remember...

241
00:37:10,190 --> 00:37:13,270
天底下两件事是没有极限的
there are only two things without limit.

242
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:16,480
女人的美
Femininity...

243
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:20,610
和追求美的
and the means to exploit it.

244
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,830
你不会吧 怎么 还没有弄好吗
I don't believe it. You're not ready yet?

245
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:18,540
你别太紧张了
You're too uptight, Amande. It's five to.

246
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,670
我最恨的就是迟到
已经五点了
If there is one thing I hate, it is being late.

247
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:23,590
你说过 等待刺激欲望
You said waiting increases desire.

248
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,880
快穿上 
Slip this on.

249
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,010
你真的要迟到了
You're really going to be late.

250
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,390
我还要用一下电脑
I still have work to do on the computer.

251
00:38:35,570 --> 00:38:39,100
不行 已经到时间了
马上
Enough already. One minute.

252
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:49,910
你真漂亮
You're very beautiful.

253
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,530
你来一起晚餐吗
是的
You're dining with me? Yes.

254
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,750
不寻常啊
今天是你的生日 23岁了
What's the occasion? It's your birthday, your 23rd.

255
00:38:58,890 --> 00:39:01,630
难为你了 你还记得
What a good memory.

256
00:39:14,780 --> 00:39:17,100
阿曼德 要加双筷子
Amande, we have company.

257
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,650
我们到外面饭馆吃饭 好吗
Perhaps you'd join me for dinner...

258
00:39:29,250 --> 00:39:30,820
走吧
out.

259
00:39:52,440 --> 00:39:54,020
我该去吗
Should I?

260
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,290
还和平常一样
The usual?

261
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:45,300
轻松点 把包放起来
You know that you can put your purse down.

262
00:41:55,070 --> 00:41:58,310
表演个魔术给你看 注意了
Now look at this. A little magic.

263
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,370
啊 你等一下
Not just yet.

264
00:42:16,050 --> 00:42:19,460
太公爵香槟 78年的
Taittinger, vintage champagne, '78.

265
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:34,220
请慢用 谢谢
Enjoy it. Thank you.

266
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:35,470
祝福你
To your future.

267
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,440
我打开了
May I now?

268
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:58,330
强力子弹 钛合金加重弹头
多附一个弹夹
It's loaded. The bullets are titanium and an extra clip in case you need it.

269
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:02,790
这算什么礼物
This doesn't make sense.

270
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:05,880
你后面坐着的三个人
There are three guests at a table behind you.

271
00:43:06,060 --> 00:43:08,590
穿橙色衣服的女人和两个穿西装的
A woman in bright orange and two men in formal attire.

272
00:43:08,690 --> 00:43:13,430
一个是保镖 另一个就是目标
要当场毙命
One is a guard. The other is a VIP. He's your target. Shot him twice.

273
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,470
完事以后就下楼
进男卫生间
When you're done, go downstairs to the men's room.

274
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:19,100
最后一间有一个能让女人通过的小窗
In the last booth, there's a small window through which a woman will fit.

275
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:21,150
你爬出去以后就到内院
You'll be in an inner courtyard.

276
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:24,030
然后穿过一条小巷
就到大街上
Then there's a long hallway that brings you to the street.

277
00:43:24,120 --> 00:43:27,030
我们的司机就在那等你
只有二分钟
There will be a driver waiting for about two minutes.

278
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:29,200
过时不候
No more.

279
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,290
请等我走以后再行动

Six months' setup time. No more. I want her ready by September.

312
00:52:20,590 --> 00:52:24,170

Let me be very blunt. Had they left it to me, I would have let you die.

313
00:52:24,350 --> 00:52:25,800
你还不如从他们中逃走
You'd better lie low.

314

I'm scared.

324
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:42,500
最可怕的过去了
The worst part's over.

330
00:55:59,030 --> 00:56:00,770
没有 不赶
No, I'm not.

331
00:56:00,950 --> 00:56:02,770
这台收银机有点问题
I hope not, because I got problems with my register.

332
00:56:02,910 --> 00:56:07,230
好象在闹情绪
今天早上传送带坏了
It only works when it lights, and the belt broke down this morning.

333

I have lots of time.

334

Crackers. You hand-painted your shirt?

340
00:56:51,460 --> 00:56:55,240
没价钱 我想这小玩意值不了多少钱
What would you guess? Anyway, it can't be more than ten francs.

341
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:56,700
十法郎

342

00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,110
我真的有点脸红
You know, I'm a bit embarrassed.

348
00:57:49,120 --> 00:57:51,860
好象应该找个话题说
Usually I'm the one who does the asking.

349
00:57:51,910 --> 00:57:55,660
你都不跟我说
可我不知道说什么
You've completely thrown me off. I don't know what to say.

350
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:57,620
我无所谓
Doesn't bother me.

351
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,960
我是挺没趣的
Yeah, well, it shouldn't bother you.

小姐 你在制造危险
You know this could be dangerous.

358
00:58:41,920 --> 00:58:44,670
有多危险
What's the worst that could happen?

359

367
00:59:59,670 --> 01:00:02,160
请里昂他来家里吃饭怎么样

368
01:00:02,260 --> 01:00:03,540
好啊
Good.

369
01:00:06,220 --> 01:00:09,550
你知道吗 他最近老想家
The guy's really been missing Britanny the past week.

我来做馅饼
I'll make us crêpes.

371
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,510
做馅饼？就凭你？
Make crêpes? You?

372
01:00:16,020 --> 01:00:17,970
我打算跟他合伙
We might be partners soon.

373
01:00:17,980 --> 01:00:21,480
做什么
我们造游艇
Doing what? We want to design boats.

374
01:00:21,570 --> 01:00:24,020
你会游泳吗？里昂可是好手
You know how to swim? Léon's a good guy.

375
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:29,610
别损了 他连女人的身体都不敢碰
Yeah, but he can't find his way out of a paper bag.

376
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,200
你的嘴好毒啊
You're so cruel.

377
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,910
也请你朋友来
You might want to invite your friend. Who's that?

378
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,040
你不是说在服装店碰到老朋友吗
一个金发美女
You told me you met one of your friends in a boutique. A blond...

379
01:00:40,130 --> 01:00:42,540
我想是上周
Last week, I think.

380
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:45,790
是旧朋友
她可不是我的好朋友
Yeah, but I wouldn't call her such a good friend.

381
01:00:45,890 --> 01:00:48,090
请她来吃饭嘛
来往多了就会成为好朋友
Invite her for dinner and you may become good friends.

382
01:00:48,180 --> 01:00:51,130
就算不成 也可以让里昂摸摸她的小手
If it doesn't work out, she'll help Léon out of his bag.

383
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:05,020
咱们是天生的一对
We're a good match.

我们在一起一年半了
We've been together for six months.

385
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:23,120
从来没有人找过你
Why don't you ever bring anyone home?

386
01:01:27,810 --> 01:01:32,050
没有亲戚 没有朋友
No parents, no friends.

01:08:32,620 --> 01:08:34,530
那太好了 
That's nice.

421
01:08:34,670 --> 01:08:37,070
你的路走得很顺利
I'm glad everything's working out for you.

422
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:40,450
我要走了 祝福你以后的任务也顺利成功
I have to go now. Good luck on your next assignment.

423
01:08:42,550 --> 01:08:43,230
鲍伯
Bob

424
01:08:43,800 --> 01:08:44,750
什么事
Yes?

425
01:08:46,510 --> 01:08:48,840
我想请你到我家来吃饭
I'd like you over for dinner at my place.

426
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:53,260
我一定到
I'd be delighted.

427
01:08:56,390 --> 01:08:57,150
鲍伯
Bob

428
01:08:57,860 --> 01:08:59,810
是鲍伯叔叔 
Right? Uncle Bob.

429
01:09:01,690 --> 01:09:04,270
快进 请进吧 她还在准备
Come in. Nice tie. She's still getting ready.

430
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:07,730
好 我来拿吧
I'll give you a hand. You have your hands full.

431
01:09:07,870 --> 01:09:10,360
您太客气了 真的 还有鲜花
You shouldn't have. The flowers, I mean.

432
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,650
噢 香槟可是好东西
Champagne suits me fine.

433
01:09:14,240 --> 01:09:16,300
嗨 鲍伯
Bob

434
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:19,790
能认识你真是太好了
I'm so pleased to get to...

435
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:21,750
你是我认识玛利以后
To know you. It's...

436
01:09:23,170 --> 01:09:26,580
家里来的第一个人
You are the first member of the family I've met.

437
01:09:26,680 --> 01:09:28,540
我家人都是混球
The others are a pain in the butt.

438
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:38,010
我先去把酒冰上好吗
I better put it in the fridge while it's still warm.

439
01:09:42,240 --> 01:09:45,600
好吃 真的很好吃
不是吹的 真是不简单啊
It's delicious, remarkable. It's so fine and light.

440
01:09:45,610 --> 01:09:48,730
噢 别别 千万别总夸她
否则我日后的日子不好过
Stop with all the compliments. My head's getting way too big.

441
01:09:48,870 --> 01:09:51,820
这顶多是不难吃而已
So one more little one, but that's all.

442
01:09:51,830 --> 01:09:54,860
我真的很久很久没见过玛利了
I haven't seen her for a long time, and I just find her...

443
01:09:54,920 --> 01:09:57,570
你看她气色多好啊
I just find her radiant.

444
01:09:57,710 --> 01:10:01,370
你猜对了
本人有一股深藏含蓄的魅力
I have to give you credit. I have a subterranean charm.

445
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:03,920
这都是你的功劳
Most aren't able to see it right away.

446
01:10:03,930 --> 01:10:07,000
要相处久了才会如沐春风
You could go ten years without noticing.

447
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,000
瞧你
There.

448
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:19,530
鲍伯 她从来不说过去
她好象没有童年一样
Tell me. You might not believe it, but I know nothing about her childhood.

449
01:10:19,540 --> 01:10:21,850
麦可 你干什么
Marco, no.

450
01:10:21,860 --> 01:10:23,890
给我讲一些她小时候的事
Tell me about when she was about ten.

451
01:10:23,950 --> 01:10:26,440
麦可 你答应过我的
Marco, you promised.

452
01:10:26,490 --> 01:10:29,280
我答应过不问你 但我问他
I promised I wouldn't ask you, not him.

453
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:32,070
你看连问都不行了
See? She won't let me ask you a single question.

454
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:34,610
我逼过你吗
Do I press you for things?

455
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:36,870
我是心甘情愿的
Never, but I wouldn't mind.

456
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,290
爱是没有条件的
But I love you just the same.

457
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,330
瞧见了 神秘女郎
Yeah, well. You see? A brick wall.

458
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,360
你还告状
So I've heard.

459
01:10:43,370 --> 01:10:44,120
玛利
Marie

460
01:10:45,760 --> 01:10:48,210
她小时候很可爱
She was so beautiful then.

461
01:10:53,270 --> 01:10:56,260
那时候她才8岁
She wore pigtails when she was only eight.

462
01:10:56,350 --> 01:10:59,930
老是跟在她表姐的身旁
And she always hung around with her cousin Caroline.

463
01:11:00,610 --> 01:11:03,350
她梳着条辫子
And only Caroline could braid Marie's pigtail.

464
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,350
跟其他的人不同
No one else.

465
01:11:08,740 --> 01:11:10,780
她在辫子上扎了条缎带
She always had a ribbon in her hair...

466
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:12,740
她只肯穿白色的衣服
and she only wore white dresses.

467
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:18,700
我只会在暑假碰到她
I only saw her in the summer...

468
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,000
整个家族在郊外的别墅度假
when the family would rent a house in the country.

469
01:11:21,010 --> 01:11:23,040
数数所有表妹和邻居
Counting all the cousins and neighbors...

470
01:11:23,130 --> 01:11:26,540
至少有二十几个孩子
是一群到处捣蛋的造反精
there were at least 20 kids running around getting into trouble.

471
01:11:31,220 --> 01:11:35,720
玛利还有个看家本领 学青蛙叫
Marie had a very special talent...
imitating frogs.

472
01:11:39,230 --> 01:11:42,680
她经常偷偷溜到池塘里
She'd sneak down to the pond whenever she could.

473
01:11:42,860 --> 01:11:46,400
搞得自己满身是泥 蹲在水边呱呱的叫
一群小孩笑翻在地
She'd jump in the mud croaking until every kid fell down laughing.

474
01:11:47,780 --> 01:11:51,320
然后她就一身湿的回来
She'd come back, dripping and soaking wet...

475
01:11:51,370 --> 01:11:55,110
每次她都一个德行
and every time she would use the same excuse.

476
01:11:55,170 --> 01:11:57,780
“一不小心而已”
"It was just an accident"...

477
01:11:57,840 --> 01:11:59,830
她总是说
with that small voice she had.

478
01:12:02,510 --> 01:12:04,870
她现在还很淘气
She hasn't changed much, you know.

479
01:12:04,970 --> 01:12:07,290
她没告诉你我是干哪一行的
Has Marie ever told you what I do for a living?

480
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,760
噢 我们家的男人不能发问
I'm not allowed to ask any questions.

481
01:12:14,600 --> 01:12:16,930
我是开旅行社的
I've been working as a travel agent.

482
01:12:16,940 --> 01:12:19,890
没事就得绕着地球跑
It includes some nice perks here and there.

483
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:22,520
两张去威尼斯的
Two tickets for Venice.

484
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:27,270
给你们的订婚礼物
It's my engagement present.

485
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:37,320
真不知道该说什么才好
那就别说
I don't know what to say. Well, say nothing.

486
01:12:56,700 --> 01:12:57,620
老式游艇
Gondola

487
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:01,560
司鼓式引擎 对不对
是木头制的
Drum-like engine, Isn't it?
Real wood.

488
01:13:02,610 --> 01:13:04,350
他也听不懂
I'm talking to myself.

489
01:13:15,790 --> 01:13:17,740
看这 看这
Look at me!

490
01:13:29,070 --> 01:13:31,320
好了  到了
Ah, yes

491
01:13:36,370 --> 01:13:39,680
来来来 帮帮忙
Ah, ah, ah

492
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:41,640
来 当心脚下
Watch your step.

493
01:13:44,990 --> 01:13:46,650
谢谢你
Thank you.

494
01:13:46,660 --> 01:13:47,980
这边请
This way.

495
01:13:51,990 --> 01:13:53,990
不再坐船了  我都晕了
Oh, no, not more gondola.

496
01:13:54,870 --> 01:13:56,740
我要游船河 游呀 游呀
More gondola, more gondola.

497
01:13:59,250 --> 01:14:04,040
我是船夫...
Gondolier...

498
01:14:04,090 --> 01:14:07,380
威尼斯的船夫
from Venice!

499
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:13,670
我想要你
I want you.

500
01:14:13,730 --> 01:14:15,550
我渴了 我也是
I'm thirsty too. Me too.

501
01:14:15,600 --> 01:14:17,720
也饿了 我也是
Hungry too. Me too.

502
01:14:17,770 --> 01:14:19,720
应声虫 帮我脱裙子
Copycat. Pull off my skirt.

503
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:21,720
快点
Right away.

504
01:14:23,450 --> 01:14:25,810
开始 拉
Now come on. Pull!

505
01:14:34,960 --> 01:14:37,910
来拿着 
Hold this up for me.

506
01:14:39,460 --> 01:14:43,250
你好 我要点餐 一份帝王沙拉
一个七色拼盘
We'd like one side order of ham San Daniele, one assortment of cheese...

507
01:14:43,380 --> 01:14:49,630
还有两大瓶水
我要和我的男人作爱 一会儿会汗流雨下的
and two bottles of water because we sweat like pigs when we make love.

508
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,550
发神经
She's crazy.

509
01:14:54,140 --> 01:14:56,640
接电话的他是不是吓坏了
What did they have to say?

510
01:14:56,650 --> 01:14:59,010
他说他也会汗如雨下的
They should have the same problem at home.

511
01:15:02,440 --> 01:15:04,440
这度假真好
It's good to be here.

512
01:15:10,990 --> 01:15:12,440
你别怕
Don't budge.

513
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,190
喂
Hello

514
01:15:16,640 --> 01:15:18,150

Joséphine.

515
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:20,530
喂
Hello

516
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,300
加斯黑了
Joséphine.

517
01:15:26,300 --> 01:15:27,750
我是
Yeah.

518
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,920
浴室的柜子里有一个暗盒
There's a secret compartment in the bathroom cabinet.

519
01:15:40,150 --> 01:15:43,810
好吧 那就换甜圆沙拉好了 
All right. Make it a green salad instead, please.

520
01:15:44,950 --> 01:15:46,400
谢谢
Thank you.

521
01:15:54,160 --> 01:15:56,410
帝王沙拉卖完了
There is no more San Daniele.

522
01:15:56,580 --> 01:15:58,410
叫他们经理来
Get me the manager.

523
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:03,620
我洗个澡
I'm gonna pour a bath.

524
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,960
放松一下 送餐的马上就来了
Just relax and take care of room service.

525
01:16:47,300 --> 01:16:49,790
加斯黑了就位了
Joséphine in position.

526
01:16:49,850 --> 01:16:52,090
工具在洗脸盆下面
The first elements are under the sink.

527
01:17:41,570 --> 01:17:42,810
组合完毕
Assembly complete.

528
01:17:42,860 --> 01:17:44,810
打开窗子
Open the window.

529
01:17:50,490 --> 01:17:54,240
你叫我怎么打开窗户
自己想办法
How am I supposed to open the window? You'll work it out.

530
01:17:57,920 --> 01:17:58,830
玛利
Sweetheart?

531
01:18:01,130 --> 01:18:02,080
干嘛
What?

532
01:18:02,090 --> 01:18:04,370
你猜我在想什么
You know what I'm thinking?

533
01:18:04,540 --> 01:18:05,590
不知道
No.

534
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:10,000
第一次在商店遇见你的时候
Of the moment I first saw you in the store. You were so beautiful.

535
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:12,590
我还以为老天是很残酷的呢
I thought, "Life can play such dirty tricks...

536
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:15,760
这么美丽的女人怎么可能共度一生呢
because I'll never have a girl like that to share my life.

537
01:18:15,850 --> 01:18:17,850
跟我这个无名小卒
To be with me.

538
01:18:20,440 --> 01:18:22,220
不可能的
Never."

539
01:18:27,990 --> 01:18:31,070
可是我们现在却真的在一起了
Now we are both here. Together.

540
01:18:34,460 --> 01:18:36,450
准备好了
Okay

541
01:18:36,460 --> 01:18:38,370
运河边有一艘游艇 
There's a white boat on the canal...

542
01:18:38,460 --> 01:18:41,330
穿兰色衬衫
with a driver in a blue shirt.

543
01:18:41,380 --> 01:18:45,830
左边有两个人在屋门口等着
To the left, there are two people waiting outside a door.

544
01:18:46,010 --> 01:18:47,880
你要瞄准好
Take aim and be ready.

545
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:50,090
我们再等待进一步的命令
We're waiting for orders.

546
01:19:00,860 --> 01:19:01,620
玛利
Marie

547
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,850
什么
我有话跟你说
Yeah? Can we talk?

548
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,900
说吧 不准进来
Okay, but don't come in.

549
01:19:15,860 --> 01:19:21,450
玛利
Marie

550
01:19:21,460 --> 01:19:24,000
我不想惹你烦 但是
I don't want to bother you with my questions.

551
01:19:25,880 --> 01:19:28,000
我不知道你以前
I don't know...

552
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:31,840
发生过什么事或闯了什么祸
what you did or what happened that got you to this point...

553
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,800
使你变成现在这个样子
so wound up.

554
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:42,890
但是我总想着你 有时总往坏处想
But I think about it once in a while, you know?
And I imagine the worst.

555
01:19:44,320 --> 01:19:46,270
可想到头了也就算了
The worst would be a relief.

556
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:55,950
谁呀
送餐的
What is it? Room service.

557
01:19:57,920 --> 01:19:58,870
来了
Coming.

558
01:20:06,840 --> 01:20:09,250
停在这里好了 不是卖完了吗
Stop, stop. I thought you were out of ham.

559
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:12,760
算了 放这吧 谢谢
Never mind. No big deal.

几个目标
一个 要开两枪
How many targets? Only one, but two shots.

561
01:20:17,190 --> 01:20:20,510
怎么识别
还在等情报
How do I single him out? I don't have that information yet.

562
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:32,610
准备  目标十秒钟出现
Stand by. Target will be visible in ten seconds.

563
01:20:42,630 --> 01:20:46,920
到底是哪一个
还在等情报
Which one is he? I don't have that information yet.

564
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,120
玛利
Marie

565
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:52,550

Which one, damn it? The woman.

566
01:20:52,640 --> 01:20:54,340
穿咖啡色的 女的
The woman in brown.

567
01:20:54,430 --> 01:20:55,880
就是那个女人 快开枪
The woman, damn it!

568
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:57,590
你在干什么 快开枪
What are you doing? The woman!

569
01:21:07,280 --> 01:21:09,360
你怎么了  为什么不出声
What's wrong? Why don't you answer?

570
01:21:09,410 --> 01:21:11,780
说过不准进来的
You promised not to come in.

571
01:21:11,910 --> 01:21:13,860
我知道 可我听到点动静
I know, but I heard some noise.

572
01:21:13,950 --> 01:21:17,200
我在门外叫你老半天
Damn it, for half an hour I've been talking from behind the door.

573
01:21:17,290 --> 01:21:19,240
你怎么不出声呢
You might answer me.

574
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,430
行了 你一个字也没有听进去
You didn't hear a word?

575
01:21:50,200 --> 01:21:51,900
好吧 
All right.

576
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:55,950
路上吃
Here. For the road.

577
01:22:49,930 --> 01:22:51,840

巧克力 谢谢
Chocolate. Thank you.

579
01:23:00,480 --> 01:23:04,730
你想说假期愉快是吗
Want to know how I spent my vacation, is that it?

580
01:23:04,820 --> 01:23:08,730
我越来越了解你们这些虐待狂了
I'm getting to know you and your sadistic ways.

581
01:23:09,410 --> 01:23:11,320
你们是一群疯子 
You're mad.

582
01:23:11,450 --> 01:23:14,240
用我来作工具
Totally sick.

583
01:23:14,370 --> 01:23:16,650
跟着你们玩这些残忍小游戏
You just used me to play your cruel little game.

584
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:20,950
看见你真好
It's so good to see you.

585
01:23:25,510 --> 01:23:29,590
还记得当你教官的时候
我真怀念那段日子
I'm guess I'm nostalgic for the times I had you all to myself.

586
01:23:29,760 --> 01:23:32,420
这次是个大使
还有半年他就要任满回国了
It's an ambassador. In six months, he returns home.

587
01:23:32,430 --> 01:23:35,720
必须在他回国以前完成
你可以选人手组合班子
You have to get him before he leaves. It's your show. Choose your team.

588
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:39,090
你有6个月时间 上级要求做得漂亮
You have six months. They want a nice, clean job.

589
01:23:39,190 --> 01:23:41,060
我推荐了你
I thought of you.

590
01:23:47,030 --> 01:23:49,190
甜言蜜语下毒手 你的老招了
You're always combining two things at once.

591
01:23:50,660 --> 01:23:52,650
谁要我想念你
The vagaries of love.

592
01:24:27,280 --> 01:24:29,730
不喜欢我送的花
Not impressed with your new plant?

593
01:24:37,170 --> 01:24:39,280
你瞧瞧这个如何
There we are. That's much better.

594
01:24:42,710 --> 01:24:46,330
从今天开始 我不再是收银员了
No more Mr. Cashier because after today, I'm finished.

595
01:24:46,800 --> 01:24:48,380
我辞职了
造游艇？
I quit. You'll make boats?

596
01:24:48,510 --> 01:24:50,710
对 得庆祝一下
You bet I will. Let's celebrate.

597
01:24:50,760 --> 01:24:52,210
那当然
But of course.

598
01:25:05,610 --> 01:25:07,690
谁教你这么笑的
Who taught you how to smile like that?

599
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:08,690
是你
You did.

600
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:13,820
咱们搬家吧
I think we should move.

601
01:25:13,910 --> 01:25:18,740
我想你需要一个大一点的地方
I believe that something more spacious would suit you better.

602
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,990
他跟情妇在9号屋里
He went into number nine to see one of his mistresses.

603
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:02,990
一般会呆两个钟头
It'll be about a two-hour wait.

604
01:26:06,930 --> 01:26:08,830
你有火吗
You have a light?

605
01:26:08,840 --> 01:26:10,880
对不起 耽搁了
See you later.

606
01:26:21,650 --> 01:26:23,600
给 回头见
Sorry, I got held up.

607
01:26:26,610 --> 01:26:30,770
他叫杰瑞 派驻巴黎7年了
Maximilien Jedreck. Stationed in Paris for seven years.

608
01:26:30,830 --> 01:26:32,820
到处搜集情报
He acquires information from all parties...

609
01:26:32,870 --> 01:26:35,820
都藏在大使馆保险箱里
他打算亲自带回去
keeps it in a safe at the embassy until he can take it home with him.

610
01:26:35,830 --> 01:26:37,110
保守的手法 
Classic.

611
01:26:38,120 --> 01:26:41,030
什么样的情报
无所不有
What kind of information? All kinds.

612
01:26:41,040 --> 01:26:43,160
政治 高新科技 商业 
Governmental, scientific, corporate.

613
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:47,620
女的是谁
Who's the girl?

614
01:26:47,680 --> 01:26:50,750
玛瑞 搞在一起两年了
Anne-Marie something or other. They've dated about two years.

615
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,380
艺术经纪人 是卖油画的 似乎是清白的
She sells paintings. Apparently, she's clean.

616
01:26:55,730 --> 01:26:57,970
其实我们对大使没有兴趣
In fact, we're not really interested in him.

617
01:26:59,190 --> 01:27:03,220
我们想知道的是那些企业和个人出卖的国家机密
What we really want is to get the companies that are selling him the data.

618
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:06,350
他的情报就是证据
To get them, we need proof.

619
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:08,940
证据在大使馆的保险箱里
And all that proof's in the embassy safe, right?

620
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:13,400
对 钥匙一直带在他身上
目标确认就好
Yeah, and the keys are in his pocket. At least we know where to look.

621
01:27:15,200 --> 01:27:18,570
两国关系很敏感
不能出错
Right now, relations with the embassy are rather strained, so go easy.

622
01:27:18,710 --> 01:27:20,700
这个比杀人难多了
You can't hurt the ambassador.

623
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:23,580
只能用巧工夫 不能动武
It should be a finesse job, not a tour de force.

624
01:27:40,020 --> 01:27:41,470
有人在家吗
Anybody home?

625
01:27:50,530 --> 01:27:51,570
玛利
Marie

626
01:28:00,920 --> 01:28:03,040
你吓死我了
You shouldn't scare me like that.

627
01:28:21,230 --> 01:28:24,350
医院的护士是不是有一身药味 小姐
How can you work at a hospital and still smell so damn good?

628
01:28:25,940 --> 01:28:27,850
我喜欢用香水
Strong perfume.

629
01:28:33,620 --> 01:28:37,110
你好象连上三个月夜班了
如果我没记错
You've worked midnights for three months but you tell me nothing about it.

630
01:28:39,380 --> 01:28:40,990
今天是最后一天
Tonight it's over.

631
01:30:19,980 --> 01:30:22,510
比我所想象的还忙
It's much more work than I thought.

632
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:24,520
她说你可能会在这
She told me you might be here.

633
01:30:31,580 --> 01:30:34,230
玛瑞她没有跟你说吗
Marie-Hélène. Didn't she tell you?

634
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:40,200
她没说
No, she didn't.

635
01:30:55,560 --> 01:30:57,880
坐一下就走
I'll just be two minutes.

636
01:31:13,950 --> 01:31:15,900
你看怎么样
Well, what do you think of it?

637
01:31:20,920 --> 01:31:22,780
还行
It's okay.

638
01:31:22,790 --> 01:31:27,460
让我拎到五楼来可得多给点服务费
Carrying it up five stories will make a painting worth twice as much.

639
01:31:27,590 --> 01:31:29,540
你喝点什么
What can I get you to drink?

640
01:31:30,840 --> 01:31:32,750
威士忌
Some whiskey.

641
01:31:48,660 --> 01:31:52,230
你跟玛瑞工作多久了
You have worked with Anne-Marie how long?

642
01:31:52,240 --> 01:31:54,860
我老爸的画廊跟她是邻居
Every now and then. My father owns a gallery near hers.

643
01:31:54,990 --> 01:31:57,200
在同一条街上？
On the same avenue?

644
01:31:57,290 --> 01:31:59,240
对 只差一个街口
Yeah, but up a block.

645
01:32:03,920 --> 01:32:05,870
差一个街口
Up a block, up a block.

646
01:32:13,180 --> 01:32:15,090
我想起来了 一定是那家
Ah, of course.

647
01:32:17,020 --> 01:32:18,220
谢谢
Many thanks.

648
01:32:19,400 --> 01:32:21,930
是芬兰画廊北边那一家
It's up just past the gallery of Finland.

649
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:24,930
真去过 
Ah, you've been there.

650
01:32:26,190 --> 01:32:27,060
喝光 
Drink it.

651
01:32:29,490 --> 01:32:31,060
咕噜 咕噜
Glug, glug.

652
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:45,700
躺下好好睡一觉
Now down on the couch. You're gonna sleep a little.

653
01:33:14,950 --> 01:33:18,700
克里斯汀 有个清洁女工要上楼
Christian, it's just a cleaning lady on her way up.

654
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,530
好 知道了
Okay, I've got it.

655
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:34,590
加斯黑了
Joséphine

656
01:33:35,060 --> 01:33:36,920
是
Yeah?

657
01:33:36,930 --> 01:33:39,640
大使馆有暗语口令
The ambassador uses a password with his guards.

658
01:33:39,770 --> 01:33:42,810
我知道口令
口令已经改了
But we know the password. They changed it this morning.

659
01:33:42,860 --> 01:33:46,640
我们的情报证实
We just got word from surveillance.

660
01:33:46,780 --> 01:33:49,770
行动得取消了 是吗
等一下 我查查看
So we have to call it off? Hold on. I'll find out.

661
01:34:05,170 --> 01:34:07,790
不变 任务继续
怎么继续
No, the mission is maintained. How do I do that?

662
01:34:07,800 --> 01:34:10,250
等着 我们派个清理工过来
Wait there. We're sending in a cleanup man.

663
01:34:12,680 --> 01:34:14,800
这是我的案子 我已经耗了半年
Look, it's my mission. For six months...

664
01:34:14,850 --> 01:34:16,880
闭嘴 紧急通知
Shut up. Orders are orders.

665
01:34:16,930 --> 01:34:20,550
这个案子改为最高级
明白了没有
The mission is maintained with maximum priority. Understand?

666
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:24,560
去你妈的烂清理工
You can shove your stinking cleanup man!

667
01:34:28,200 --> 01:34:30,190
太危险了 我看咱们还是撤吧
It's not safe. Shouldn't we go?

668
01:34:34,120 --> 01:34:37,110
等等 一会跟来的人谈谈
No, let's talk to the man.

669
01:35:02,190 --> 01:35:03,600
莫里斯
Maurice?

670
01:35:11,280 --> 01:35:13,150
莫里斯 谁上来了
Maurice, who's coming up?

671
01:35:31,850 --> 01:35:34,340
我没事 你给我冷静
I'm fine. Keep calm.

672
01:35:34,390 --> 01:35:35,840
我没事
I'm fine!

673
01:35:36,980 --> 01:35:39,840
我去开门
I'll get it.

674
01:35:42,360 --> 01:35:44,350
我是威可多 清理工
Victor, the cleaner.

675
01:35:53,490 --> 01:35:56,320
浴室在哪儿

司机呢
后备箱里
And the chauffeur? In the trunk.

678
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:17,550
人来了 你得跟他们谈呀 笨蛋
Talk to the man. He's right there! You stupid idiot!

679
01:36:17,640 --> 01:36:19,630
活得不耐烦了  想跟他们一样？
You want to end up dead too?

680
01:36:32,410 --> 01:36:35,030
威可多 现在什么计划
Victor, we've got to make a plan.

681
01:36:35,120 --> 01:36:36,690
没有计划
No plans.

682
01:36:39,330 --> 01:36:41,120
那是什么玩意
What is that stuff for, then?

683
01:36:41,210 --> 01:36:44,080
救命的玩意
To save your ass.

684
01:36:45,090 --> 01:36:46,910
混蛋 怎么他还是活的 怎么回事
You bastards! I thought you'd killed him.

685
01:36:51,340 --> 01:36:54,630
你简直是疯了
快帮我压住他
You're an absolute maniac! Hold him down!

686
01:36:54,720 --> 01:36:57,050
我干不了了 拿去
I'm through! Get over here.

687
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:59,260
拿去吧 拿去
Take this, and this! It's over!

688
01:36:59,350 --> 01:37:02,510
疯子
先把他解决掉
Shut the fuck up. Finish him off.

689
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,520
大使馆你自己也能去 把钥匙也拿去吧
You can go to the embassy yourself! Here! Take the keys!

690
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:09,850
先把他解决掉 先把他解决掉
Finish him off! I'll finish him off!

691
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:40,960
威可多
Victor

692
01:37:42,940 --> 01:37:45,430
我们打电话请示上级行吗
Maybe I should call them for further instructions.

693
01:37:47,460 --> 01:37:49,940
不 威可多
Victor, no, no, Victor

694
01:37:52,700 --> 01:37:55,610
我执行任务从不半途而废
I am not about to stop this mission.

695
01:37:55,740 --> 01:37:57,900
不准打电话
There will be no phone calls.

696
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,570
不跟我去执行任务
就跟他们进洗澡缸
We'll finish this mission, or you're going with the others. Is that clear?

697
01:38:31,870 --> 01:38:35,400
跟你一起进去吧
不
Maybe I should come with you. You'd better not.

698
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:38,200
你在车上等着
只要给我一个小时就够了 好吗
Just stay here. I'll be one hour.

699
01:38:38,290 --> 01:38:41,950
你冷静点 别冲动
And please calm down. Calm down.

700
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,660
就给你一个小时
Fine, but only an hour.

701
01:42:25,100 --> 01:42:26,280
威可多
Victor

702
01:42:37,870 --> 01:42:39,450
怎么可能这么快
You can't be done.

703
01:42:43,630 --> 01:42:45,950
得完成任务
I'm finishing this off now.

704
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:48,870
我已经拍到资料了
We've got what we needed to get.

705
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:52,630
只要能带我出去就算完成任务了
If we can drive out, that's all.

706
01:42:52,720 --> 01:42:54,130
快走啊
All right?

707
01:42:57,140 --> 01:42:59,050
我得进去看看
Let's finish the mission.

708
01:43:01,940 --> 01:43:05,680
求求你了 威可多
没时间了
No, please. Victor, Time's up.

709
01:43:06,690 --> 01:43:09,810
快走吧 别逞强了
Let's go home. Please.

710
01:43:14,160 --> 01:43:16,780
那个家伙是谁
不知道
And who is this guy? It doesn't matter.

711
01:43:17,700 --> 01:43:20,320
大使先生没事吧
Ambassador, is there something wrong?

712
01:43:21,120 --> 01:43:22,700
噢 天啊
My God.

713
01:43:27,960 --> 01:43:30,870
快跑
Let's get out!

714
01:43:38,930 --> 01:43:40,470
马上警戒 搜索
The guards are in place.

715
01:43:42,150 --> 01:43:45,100
没事 没事 警报器坏了 妈的
It's nothing. It's a false alarm. Stay calm.

716
01:43:48,780 --> 01:43:50,330
威可多
Victor

717
01:43:58,830 --> 01:44:01,820
铁门关了 我们出不去了
They've shut the gate. We'll be trapped in here.

718
01:44:03,210 --> 01:44:04,370
我还得回来
We'll be back.

719
01:44:04,500 --> 01:44:05,870
站住
Halt!

720
01:44:09,470 --> 01:44:12,790
绕两圈再杀回来
小心
Around the block, then right back. They'll kill us!

721
01:46:04,000 --> 01:46:05,490
挪一下
Move over.

722
01:46:23,730 --> 01:46:25,810
转过来好吗
Look at me, Marie.

723
01:46:39,040 --> 01:46:40,990
我可怜的宝贝
My poor, dear Marie.

724
01:46:43,830 --> 01:46:45,660
不能再干了
They've worn you out.

725
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:50,040
这行饭不是你能吃的
太残忍
This job isn't for you. It's too hard.

726
01:46:52,470 --> 01:46:54,460
你该停手了
It's time to stop it.

727
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,670
我只想跟你在一起
You mean so much to me.

728
01:47:01,560 --> 01:47:04,220
这是我人生意义的全部
And I want to take care of you.

729
01:47:07,730 --> 01:47:10,890
没有任何事情值得去冒险
Life together is too valuable for us to risk.

730
01:47:14,620 --> 01:47:16,610
你在说什么
Why are you saying this?

731
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:23,200
我都知道了
It's the truth.

732
01:47:26,420 --> 01:47:29,290
医院说没你这个人
There's no Marie Clément at the hospital.

733
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:31,370
你的经历我都清楚了
I know what's going on.

734
01:47:34,760 --> 01:47:36,710
你干的那些跟踪
How much you go through.

735
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,800
特务 谋杀 
The spying, the surveillance...

736
01:47:41,900 --> 01:47:43,260
这都是证明
the videotapes.

737
01:47:45,940 --> 01:47:47,930
你怎么没说过
Why haven't you said anything?

738
01:47:50,900 --> 01:47:52,850
因为我爱你
I only love you.

739
01:47:58,830 --> 01:48:01,860
谢谢你 谢谢 谢谢你
Thank you. Thank you.

740
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:21,380
你是我唯一的爱人 麦可
My sweet Marco.

741
01:48:26,610 --> 01:48:29,640
我真的感觉到这唯一的爱
The world has given me only this one taste of love.

742
01:48:34,830 --> 01:48:37,780
我会永远记得你
And I will remember you always.

743
01:48:44,670 --> 01:48:46,160
你 你要离开我
You're leaving tonight?

744
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:00,010
我们一起逃吧
Maybe you'll let me come too.

745
01:49:01,900 --> 01:49:04,100
我们是不同世界的人
I want you to stay.

746
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:30,580
我爱你
I love you.

747
01:50:38,200 --> 01:50:41,530
马蒂欧 我先上去
Mathieu, I'll go first.

748
01:50:41,540 --> 01:50:43,490
有问题再呼你们
I'll call if there's a problem.

749
01:50:56,180 --> 01:50:57,840
怎么没带花
What no flowers this time?

750
01:50:59,050 --> 01:50:59,800
没有
No

751
01:51:05,610 --> 01:51:07,560
到什么时候才算完
For how long has she...

752
01:51:08,610 --> 01:51:10,520
她欠你们的债
Hasn't she paid her debt?

753
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:15,230
她就不能选择自己的生活吗
Can't she have her own life anymore?

754
01:51:17,790 --> 01:51:21,200
你毁了她
我救了她
You destroyed her life. I know what I've done.

755
01:51:21,250 --> 01:51:24,870
她当年也谋杀了一个生命
But you should know that she also destroyed a life.

756
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:27,410
一个警察的生命
A cop's life.

757
01:51:27,460 --> 01:51:29,500
让人无法忘记
And that's too hard to forget.

758
01:51:31,510 --> 01:51:33,500
那她要杀多少来还债
She killed how many for you?

759
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:35,920
你不数数人头
Why does it only count when it suits you?

760
01:51:43,460 --> 01:51:44,840
好了 麦可
Okey, Marco

761
01:51:44,860 --> 01:51:47,010
如果你真的都知道
Maybe you do understand the situation.

762
01:51:47,190 --> 01:51:51,140
好了 你知道我们当初是怎么救她的
Fine, then. I'll listen. Ask yourself how we save her.

763
01:51:52,110 --> 01:51:53,940
这次还能救吗
Can't you protect her?

764
01:51:56,580 --> 01:51:59,110
我也想
I'll try...

765
01:51:59,330 --> 01:52:02,530
可是她逼着我们追捕她
but she's forced me to hunt her.

766
01:52:02,580 --> 01:52:04,870
我们一定要找回资料
Because we must have all the embassy documents.

767
01:52:05,540 --> 01:52:09,660
那你可以放过她了 底片在我这
Her troubles are over, then, because I have them with me here.

768
01:52:36,450 --> 01:52:39,530
她留了字条 可是我撕了
She left a note for you with it, but I tore it up.

769
01:52:43,040 --> 01:52:44,780
上面说什么
What did it say?

770
01:53:06,820 --> 01:53:08,560
我们都会想她
I think we'll miss her.

771
01:53:15,280 --> 01:53:16,190
是
Yeah.
