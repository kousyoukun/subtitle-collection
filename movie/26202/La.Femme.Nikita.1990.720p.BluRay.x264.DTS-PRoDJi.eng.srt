1
00:02:09,595 --> 00:02:11,389
Zap, you fucking moron, huh?

2
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:14,600
If you'd just wait, I got keys to open it.

3
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,728
I zapped it.

4
00:02:17,812 --> 00:02:22,942
"I zapped it. I zapped it." Is that all you were born for, to zap things?

5
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:25,528
You're a real moron, you know?

6
00:02:25,528 --> 00:02:27,405
I grew up here.

7
00:02:27,446 --> 00:02:29,949
Great, then I bet you know where to find the stuff.

8
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,118
Then we won't waste a second, huh? Right.

9
00:02:33,994 --> 00:02:35,538
Gotta have it.

10
00:02:38,833 --> 00:02:40,835
You'll have it, my angel.

11
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:47,633
Yeah, well, you'd better get a move on, because I'm going down there myself.

12
00:02:52,555 --> 00:02:56,559
I'm going to make them wish they'd picked another line of work.

13
00:03:00,479 --> 00:03:02,565
You have it?

14
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:05,526
It's coming. It's coming. Be patient!

15
00:03:05,568 --> 00:03:09,196
Coyotte! Go, moron!

16
00:03:09,321 --> 00:03:11,282
For Christ's sake!

17
00:03:16,996 --> 00:03:19,081
Shit!

18
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:27,465
Where is it?

19
00:03:32,136 --> 00:03:34,263
What's the matter with you assholes? Turn the lights off.

20
00:03:35,598 --> 00:03:38,184
What do you know, a whole gang of little punks.

21
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:41,187
What are you looking for besides trouble?

22
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:47,443
Coyotte's father, huh? Huh?

23
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:53,240
Antoine?

24
00:03:55,659 --> 00:03:57,453
Papa?

25
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:01,499
It can't be you.

26
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:07,296
We're desperate.

27
00:04:10,883 --> 00:04:13,969
Gonna put a hole in your boy, Daddy, huh? Huh?

28
00:04:18,224 --> 00:04:20,184
I'll kill you!

29
00:04:35,366 --> 00:04:37,743
Do it, Zap!

30
00:05:02,893 --> 00:05:07,606
Is that all? This way! This way! My name's Rico! My name's Rico!

31
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:09,275
Zap, yeah!

32
00:05:09,483 --> 00:05:11,360
Do it! Do it! Do it, Zap!

33
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:31,630
Do it, Zap, huh? Don't miss anything, huh?

34
00:05:33,299 --> 00:05:36,135
Go on zapping everything!

35
00:05:47,438 --> 00:05:50,024
Everything, Rico! I'm zapping everything!

36
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:55,863
Zap! Zap! Zap!

37
00:06:58,884 --> 00:07:00,261
No more?

38
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,418
Shut up.

39
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:36,464
Shut up, I said!

40
00:07:38,174 --> 00:07:40,051
Let's go. Let's go.

41
00:07:41,135 --> 00:07:42,970
Hands behind your back.

42
00:07:43,054 --> 00:07:45,931
Spread your legs. Spread them out!

43
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:20,841
Name, full name.

44
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:25,805
Nikita.

45
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:31,018
A piece of advice, sweetheart.

46
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,105
Drop the act.

47
00:08:34,271 --> 00:08:36,690
You might think it's funny, but I'm on to you.

48
00:08:37,733 --> 00:08:39,902
Got it?

49
00:08:40,027 --> 00:08:41,695
Got it.

50
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:54,083
You might want to take a small break.

51
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:57,503
She's fine. She's fine. I know her type.

52
00:08:57,586 --> 00:09:00,131
It's all a game.

53
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:02,007
Can I write it?

54
00:09:05,678 --> 00:09:09,682
Good girl. Now, write your full name, first and last, huh?

55
00:09:10,599 --> 00:09:13,769
My name is Nikita!

56
00:09:57,396 --> 00:10:00,024
After careful deliberation we declare the accused guilty...

57
00:10:00,024 --> 00:10:02,234
of having in the community of St. Denis...

58
00:10:02,443 --> 00:10:05,488
committed the willful murders of Georges Henri...

59
00:10:05,613 --> 00:10:07,782
Grégoire Anderson and Michel Terlin...

60
00:10:07,865 --> 00:10:10,910
law enforcement agents killed in the line of duty.

61
00:10:10,993 --> 00:10:14,789
As to the question of extenuating circumstances...

62
00:10:14,872 --> 00:10:17,458
the jury has found none in this matter.

63
00:10:18,876 --> 00:10:24,006
Consequently, in accordance with article 304 of the criminal code...

64
00:10:24,131 --> 00:10:27,218
the defendant is hereby sentenced to life imprisonment.

65
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:30,930
There is no question of review for parole for 30 years.

66
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:34,475
Court is adjourned.

67
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:45,111
Thirty years.

68
00:10:51,117 --> 00:10:54,286
I'll kill you all!

69
00:10:54,412 --> 00:10:57,289
I'll kill you all!

70
00:10:57,373 --> 00:11:00,084
Let me go, asshole!

71
00:11:01,585 --> 00:11:02,962
Let me go!

72
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,423
I'll kill you all!

73
00:11:05,506 --> 00:11:07,508
Get her out of here.

74
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:13,991
Mister, please. You have no right.

75
00:12:16,786 --> 00:12:19,163
But I'm supposed to go to prison.

76
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,086
We must find Mama.

77
00:12:25,169 --> 00:12:27,463
She's been informed.

78
00:12:32,176 --> 00:12:35,096
But isn't she supposed to be with me?

79
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,809
Please try. I must see Mama.

80
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:47,608
Maybe this whole thing is a big mistake.

81
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:50,194
She'll find me here. You'll see.

82
00:12:50,277 --> 00:12:53,072
You have to wait till I see Mama!

83
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:00,204
Mama.

84
00:14:37,051 --> 00:14:38,344
Morning.

85
00:15:20,886 --> 00:15:22,722
Tell me your name, please.

86
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,064
That's quite a pretty name.

87
00:15:32,106 --> 00:15:34,108
Where does it come from?

88
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,113
- An old song. - What are the words to that song?

89
00:15:49,707 --> 00:15:54,170
Mister, just tell me. Is this God's heaven?

90
00:15:57,715 --> 00:16:02,053
No, but it's a possibility.

91
00:16:05,139 --> 00:16:07,600
Officially you're deceased as of Monday at 6:00.

92
00:16:09,226 --> 00:16:11,729
The prison doctor confirmed that you committed suicide...

93
00:16:11,854 --> 00:16:13,981
by taking a massive dose of tranquilizers.

94
00:16:14,065 --> 00:16:18,194
You were buried at the cemetery at Maisons-Alfort, aisle seven, number 30.

95
00:16:23,532 --> 00:16:26,285
Titi. That's Titi.

96
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:35,419
Let's just say I work for the government...

97
00:16:37,838 --> 00:16:41,717
and they decided to give you a new chance to make amends.

98
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:50,768
What's involved?

99
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:52,728
A rebirth.

100
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:56,690
You'll be taught reading, smiling, speaking, walking, even how to fight.

101
00:16:56,732 --> 00:16:58,734
You'll be starting all over.

102
00:17:00,236 --> 00:17:03,155
- But what for? - To serve the state.

103
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:08,869
And suppose I refuse?

104
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:14,959
Aisle seven, number 30.

105
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:24,760
Would you mind if I slept before I give you my answer?

106
00:17:32,309 --> 00:17:34,895
I'll give you one hour.

107
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:15,102
Asshole!

108
00:18:24,528 --> 00:18:27,531
- How do we get out of here? - Right in front.

109
00:18:32,370 --> 00:18:34,413
- Who are all these shitheads? - Employees.

110
00:18:36,665 --> 00:18:38,626
Nobody move! Everything's fine!

111
00:18:38,834 --> 00:18:41,128
My ass it is! Nothing's fine!

112
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:45,216
It's under control.

113
00:18:50,388 --> 00:18:53,099
- Open it up. - Nobody leaves.

114
00:18:56,852 --> 00:18:58,938
Tell them to open the door!

115
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:01,440
They won't open it.

116
00:19:04,026 --> 00:19:08,531
- I'll blow your head off! - Just put it down.

117
00:19:08,572 --> 00:19:11,242
Let go. Stop it now. Let go of me!

118
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,498
Hold it.

119
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,500
Now put it down.

120
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:26,549
All right, all right. Go back to your desks.

121
00:19:45,359 --> 00:19:47,778
I always leave the first chamber empty.

122
00:19:51,282 --> 00:19:54,201
That ought to clip your wings for a while.

123
00:20:32,907 --> 00:20:35,076
Have you made up your mind?

124
00:20:40,414 --> 00:20:42,124
That's fine.

125
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:52,676
Forms for you to sign.

126
00:20:58,349 --> 00:21:00,101
Think I can make it?

127
00:21:04,021 --> 00:21:05,981
You can make it.

128
00:21:12,697 --> 00:21:15,199
I'm going to start you with a fairly easy program.

129
00:21:15,199 --> 00:21:19,370
It's like a typewriter keyboard exactly. It's got letters and numbers.

130
00:21:19,495 --> 00:21:21,455
That's the mouse. There's a small roller underneath.

131
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:24,667
When you move it there, it moves the arrow on the screen.

132
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:29,046
Good. If you press it, you can make images, drawings.

133
00:21:29,171 --> 00:21:30,715
Try it.

134
00:21:32,258 --> 00:21:34,802
There you go. Easy. Too fast, too fast.

135
00:21:34,844 --> 00:21:36,679
That's too fast. Wait a minute.

136
00:21:36,846 --> 00:21:40,015
Now, bring up the arrow back here, back in the corner right over here.

137
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:42,643
Go on. Bring it back in the corner right here.

138
00:21:44,186 --> 00:21:46,230
That's fine. Now, you press here.

139
00:21:48,858 --> 00:21:51,068
Very good.

140
00:21:51,193 --> 00:21:53,154
Again.

141
00:21:58,868 --> 00:22:02,538
These are the firearms we generally use.

142
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:06,250
Let's start with the simplest weapon... Beretta 93R.

143
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:10,087
Nine millimeter, Parabellum, 20-round clip.

144
00:22:11,255 --> 00:22:13,716
Never underrate a fatal weapon.

145
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:17,219
Before I demonstrate the firing position...

146
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,597
I want you to be familiar with this beast.

147
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:21,057
Mark at ten meters.

148
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,581
You shot one before.

149
00:22:46,582 --> 00:22:48,709
Never on paper.

150
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,712
Eight, nine, ten.

151
00:23:08,938 --> 00:23:10,981
Keep it nice and round.

152
00:23:11,148 --> 00:23:12,525
Okay.

153
00:23:15,277 --> 00:23:18,197
- You're up. Let's go. - My leg's bothering me.

154
00:23:18,322 --> 00:23:21,867
No problem. We'll just test your reflexes.

155
00:23:23,035 --> 00:23:24,995
It's very simple.

156
00:23:37,007 --> 00:23:38,050
In position.

157
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,562
I'll maintain a defensive stance...

158
00:23:49,603 --> 00:23:52,565
and you will try to hit me in the face.

159
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,457
Next one up.

160
00:25:31,372 --> 00:25:32,790
Sit down there.

161
00:25:51,559 --> 00:25:54,812
My dear girl, right now you don't really look like much.

162
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:56,480
Chewing gum.

163
00:25:56,605 --> 00:26:00,276
But if our efforts are repeated in mutual...

164
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:02,820
and if God smiles upon us...

165
00:26:02,945 --> 00:26:06,741
we will then be able to make you look like a human being...

166
00:26:06,782 --> 00:26:09,994
a step, an intermediate one, but necessary...

167
00:26:09,994 --> 00:26:13,581
before we have what's essential to a man...

168
00:26:13,664 --> 00:26:15,708
a woman.

169
00:26:28,637 --> 00:26:30,931
Are you pleased?

170
00:26:35,519 --> 00:26:38,898
How about giving me your definition of grace?

171
00:26:40,649 --> 00:26:42,318
It would sound silly.

172
00:26:42,401 --> 00:26:45,613
Maybe so, then at least you should smile more.

173
00:26:45,696 --> 00:26:48,449
You've always got that when you can't respond.

174
00:26:48,491 --> 00:26:50,451
It won't make you more intelligent...

175
00:26:50,451 --> 00:26:53,329
but it's more enjoyable for those who have to watch.

176
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,291
And if you have it...

177
00:26:57,333 --> 00:27:02,797
perhaps its fragility gives my girl an advantage.

178
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:04,757
A smile.

179
00:27:08,761 --> 00:27:11,430
A smile...

180
00:27:11,514 --> 00:27:15,976
and soon you'll have its power...

181
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,651
as if from your very soul.

182
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:54,974
Shall we fix up the wig?

183
00:28:16,078 --> 00:28:18,164
It's been going all right?

184
00:28:18,289 --> 00:28:20,750
I wish it were gone already.

185
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:23,085
We've acquired a sense of humor. That's very promising.

186
00:28:30,426 --> 00:28:34,430
- You friends with anybody? - Yeah, I'm in real tight with my mouse.

187
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:43,356
How about a drink at a bar somewhere?

188
00:28:45,274 --> 00:28:46,817
Not just yet.

189
00:28:48,694 --> 00:28:50,696
Don't we ever get any rest in this factory?

190
00:28:50,780 --> 00:28:52,239
Never.

191
00:28:52,365 --> 00:28:54,075
The wig becomes you.

192
00:28:59,455 --> 00:29:02,500
Next week I'll be 20 years old.

193
00:29:04,377 --> 00:29:07,546
What about giving me a pass for just the weekend?

194
00:29:09,632 --> 00:29:11,092
Have me followed?

195
00:29:54,009 --> 00:29:56,846
How are ya? I got a program to die for.

196
00:29:56,887 --> 00:29:58,931
I'm glad you're here.

197
00:30:02,935 --> 00:30:04,103
For you.

198
00:30:09,650 --> 00:30:11,652
May I open it?

199
00:30:21,954 --> 00:30:26,250
Had a mouse named Isher and I loved Isher

200
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:31,213
Then I found a fellow who had a face like Isher did

201
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:38,012
Stretch! That's it. Stretch it out. Good.

202
00:30:38,054 --> 00:30:40,514
Now back and forward.

203
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:45,728
Bring the left leg forward.

204
00:31:33,984 --> 00:31:37,905
Yeah, for two months she's been nothing but trouble.

205
00:31:37,947 --> 00:31:39,532
You picked up a failure.

206
00:31:39,657 --> 00:31:41,909
She has enormous potential.

207
00:31:42,034 --> 00:31:43,661
What potential?

208
00:31:43,828 --> 00:31:46,038
Up till now, except for temper tantrums and biting instructors...

209
00:31:46,205 --> 00:31:48,416
you tell me what she's capable of.

210
00:31:48,541 --> 00:31:51,293
The best ones always take more training time.

211
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:53,587
Six, seven years sometimes.

212
00:31:53,713 --> 00:31:55,756
Oh, come on.

213
00:31:55,798 --> 00:31:59,093
You've got two weeks for her to show any progress...

214
00:31:59,176 --> 00:32:01,512
or that will be the end of her.

215
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,732
- But who are you? - I don't know.

216
00:32:12,857 --> 00:32:17,486
- Wait. Wait. You are... - Yes.

217
00:32:17,611 --> 00:32:21,407
- Why are you in my arms, my darling? - I don't know.

218
00:32:22,783 --> 00:32:24,702
But it's too late now.

219
00:32:27,705 --> 00:32:30,207
After all, maybe it's only a dream.

220
00:32:34,045 --> 00:32:36,005
Oh, my love.

221
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:44,889
You've made a lot of progress, mainly in dance...

222
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:48,100
and also in painting.

223
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:51,520
But in all the other subjects...

224
00:32:55,358 --> 00:32:57,943
nothing, zilch...

225
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:59,528
zero.

226
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:04,658
Wait for me.

227
00:33:24,762 --> 00:33:27,181
For your birthday.

228
00:33:31,644 --> 00:33:32,853
Go ahead.

229
00:34:11,892 --> 00:34:14,228
We have two weeks to prove you're worthy, Nikita.

230
00:34:16,022 --> 00:34:18,607
After that, there's nothing more I can do for you.

231
00:34:20,151 --> 00:34:22,069
Nothing at all.

232
00:36:14,682 --> 00:36:17,268
It's my hands you're looking at?

233
00:36:19,395 --> 00:36:22,356
They were pretty once...

234
00:36:22,398 --> 00:36:24,608
but that's the past.

235
00:36:27,236 --> 00:36:29,280
You were like me before?

236
00:37:04,607 --> 00:37:07,443
Let go and you'll find what pleases.

237
00:37:08,486 --> 00:37:10,821
The pleasure of the feminine.

238
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:14,325
And remember...

239
00:37:14,367 --> 00:37:17,453
there are only two things without limit.

240
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:20,664
Femininity...

241
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:24,794
and the means to exploit it.

242
00:38:14,051 --> 00:38:18,013
I don't believe it. You're not ready yet?

243
00:38:19,849 --> 00:38:22,727
- You're too uptight, Amande. - It's five to.

244
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:24,854
If there is one thing I hate, it is being late.

245
00:38:24,854 --> 00:38:27,773
You said waiting increases desire.

246
00:38:29,817 --> 00:38:32,069
Slip this on.

247
00:38:34,155 --> 00:38:36,198
You're really going to be late.

248
00:38:37,408 --> 00:38:39,577
I still have work to do on the computer.

249
00:38:39,744 --> 00:38:43,289
- Enough already. - One minute.

250
00:38:52,131 --> 00:38:54,091
You're very beautiful.

251
00:38:54,091 --> 00:38:56,719
- You're dining with me? - Yes.

252
00:38:58,054 --> 00:39:02,933
- What's the occasion? - It's your birthday, your 23rd.

253
00:39:03,059 --> 00:39:05,811
What a good memory.

254
00:39:18,949 --> 00:39:21,285
Amande, we have company.

255
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:31,837
Perhaps you'd join me for dinner...

256
00:39:33,422 --> 00:39:35,007
out.

257
00:39:56,612 --> 00:39:58,197
Should I?

258
00:41:38,172 --> 00:41:40,466
The usual?

259
00:41:45,721 --> 00:41:49,475
You know that you can put your purse down.

260
00:41:59,235 --> 00:42:02,488
Now look at this. A little magic.

261
00:42:14,542 --> 00:42:16,544
Not just yet.

262
00:42:20,214 --> 00:42:23,634
Taittinger, vintage champagne, '78.

263
00:42:36,355 --> 00:42:38,399
- Enjoy it. - Thank you.

264
00:42:38,482 --> 00:42:39,650
To your future.

265
00:42:44,447 --> 00:42:45,614
May I now?

266
00:42:57,668 --> 00:43:02,506
It's loaded. The bullets are titanium and an extra clip in case you need it.

267
00:43:05,593 --> 00:43:06,969
This doesn't make sense.

268
00:43:07,845 --> 00:43:10,056
There are three guests at a table behind you.

269
00:43:10,222 --> 00:43:12,767
A woman in bright orange and two men in formal attire.

270
00:43:12,850 --> 00:43:17,605
One is a guard. The other is a VIP. He's your target. Shot him twice.

271
00:43:17,688 --> 00:43:19,648
When you're done, go downstairs to the men's room.

272
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:23,277
In the last booth, there's a small window through which a woman will fit.

273
00:43:23,361 --> 00:43:25,321
You'll be in an inner courtyard.

274
00:43:25,363 --> 00:43:28,199
Then there's a long hallway that brings you to the street.

275
00:43:28,282 --> 00:43:31,202
There will be a driver waiting for about two minutes.

276
00:43:32,036 --> 00:43:33,371
No more.

277
00:43:38,459 --> 00:43:41,462
I'd like you to wait till I'm out of here.

278
00:45:18,559 --> 00:45:20,686
Hey, look down there.

279
00:45:32,448 --> 00:45:33,532
Eddy!

280
00:46:09,443 --> 00:46:11,946
Move over.

281
00:46:17,785 --> 00:46:18,869
Stay there.

282
00:47:08,502 --> 00:47:09,879
Jos?

283
00:47:12,131 --> 00:47:13,883
I have it.

284
00:48:45,182 --> 00:48:49,103
Hey, miss! Hey! Stop! Come back here!

285
00:48:51,397 --> 00:48:52,690
Open it up.

286
00:48:54,692 --> 00:48:56,736
She's... There's a problem at the door.

287
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:57,862
Miss...

288
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:04,076
Damn it, you moron! Just let me in!

289
00:49:20,384 --> 00:49:23,596
Bob, they had it bricked over.

290
00:49:23,679 --> 00:49:26,098
The window was bricked over!

291
00:49:27,725 --> 00:49:29,810
Of course it was bricked.

292
00:49:40,321 --> 00:49:42,323
- You son of a bitch! - Stop it!

293
00:49:42,448 --> 00:49:45,409
- You son of a bitch! - Stop it, Nikita!

294
00:49:45,451 --> 00:49:47,912
- I hate you! - It's over now! It's over.

295
00:49:47,995 --> 00:49:50,998
- I hate you! - You get out tomorrow!

296
00:49:51,123 --> 00:49:54,085
You get out tomorrow!

297
00:50:09,141 --> 00:50:12,353
Now just calm down. Damn it!

298
00:50:18,109 --> 00:50:20,236
We have to...

299
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:24,949
We have to do this sort of exercise before releasing you from the center.

300
00:50:37,753 --> 00:50:39,630
You've done well, Nikita.

301
00:50:42,925 --> 00:50:44,927
Tonight...

302
00:50:44,927 --> 00:50:47,013
and all these years.

303
00:50:50,933 --> 00:50:52,977
I will miss you.

304
00:51:23,424 --> 00:51:25,342
It's the last kiss you'll get from me.

305
00:51:59,001 --> 00:52:02,046
Just what kind of mission do you have in mind for her?

306
00:52:02,088 --> 00:52:03,130
S1.

307
00:52:04,090 --> 00:52:06,050
You're as ambitious as you ever were.

308
00:52:08,010 --> 00:52:10,221
Don't sit down.

309
00:52:20,981 --> 00:52:24,694
Six months' setup time. No more. I want her ready by September.

310
00:52:24,735 --> 00:52:28,322
Let me be very blunt. Had they left it to me, I would have let you die.

311
00:52:28,489 --> 00:52:29,949
You'd better lie low.

312
00:52:30,074 --> 00:52:32,702
There won't be any warnings. Is that clear?

313
00:52:39,917 --> 00:52:43,003
- How many are mine? - Two maximum.

314
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,340
Jeannot.

315
00:53:00,271 --> 00:53:04,775
Marie Clément from Sarlat, a nurse at the Salpétrière.

316
00:53:04,859 --> 00:53:08,112
The bank's in front of the hospital, you'll receive a payment each month.

317
00:53:08,279 --> 00:53:13,034
Passport, driver's license, plus some money to start with.

318
00:53:14,326 --> 00:53:16,287
For your missions you'll go by the name...

319
00:53:19,206 --> 00:53:21,459
Joséphine.

320
00:53:33,304 --> 00:53:35,514
Good luck to you.

321
00:53:40,603 --> 00:53:41,604
I'm scared.

322
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,650
The worst part's over.

323
00:54:47,670 --> 00:54:52,550
Second floor, very bright, central heating...

324
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:55,886
and the best part is it's available now.

325
00:54:56,095 --> 00:54:57,138
Perfect.

326
00:54:58,806 --> 00:55:00,641
Perfect.

327
00:56:00,368 --> 00:56:03,120
Excuse me. You in a big rush, huh?

328
00:56:03,162 --> 00:56:04,914
No, I'm not.

329
00:56:05,081 --> 00:56:06,916
I hope not, because I got problems with my register.

330
00:56:07,041 --> 00:56:11,379
It only works when it lights, and the belt broke down this morning.

331
00:56:11,545 --> 00:56:13,422
I have lots of time.

332
00:56:15,299 --> 00:56:19,887
Must be nice. Let's make a pile here. We'll go through it.

333
00:56:27,061 --> 00:56:28,396
Ravioli.

334
00:56:31,941 --> 00:56:34,193
Why, more ravioli.

335
00:56:35,236 --> 00:56:38,239
Forgive me. I'm slow, but I've only worked here two days.

336
00:56:38,239 --> 00:56:41,158
But it's very complicated.

337
00:56:48,207 --> 00:56:51,335
Crackers. You hand-painted your shirt?

338
00:56:55,589 --> 00:56:59,385
What would you guess? Anyway, it can't be more than ten francs.

339
00:56:59,593 --> 00:57:00,845
Ten francs.

340
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:12,982
What are you doing after work?

341
00:57:16,527 --> 00:57:18,279
Nothing really.

342
00:57:20,531 --> 00:57:22,324
Want to have dinner with me?

343
00:57:27,288 --> 00:57:28,831
Ten francs.

344
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:41,989
It's not finished.

345
00:57:50,831 --> 00:57:53,251
You know, I'm a bit embarrassed.

346
00:57:53,251 --> 00:57:56,003
Usually I'm the one who does the asking.

347
00:57:56,045 --> 00:57:59,799
You've completely thrown me off. I don't know what to say.

348
00:57:59,799 --> 00:58:01,759
Doesn't bother me.

349
00:58:03,928 --> 00:58:06,097
Yeah, well, it shouldn't bother you.

350
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:13,020
It's good.

351
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:15,022
Someone told a joke to me at work this morning.

352
00:58:15,147 --> 00:58:17,608
Want to hear it?

353
00:58:19,652 --> 00:58:21,028
Nope?

354
00:58:24,866 --> 00:58:27,159
Yeah, well, I better eat while it's hot.

355
00:58:43,217 --> 00:58:45,928
You know this could be dangerous.

356
00:58:46,053 --> 00:58:48,806
What's the worst that could happen?

357
00:58:48,890 --> 00:58:50,683
Leftovers?

358
00:59:36,270 --> 00:59:38,189
You said you'd have breakfast ready.

359
00:59:38,231 --> 00:59:40,858
I put the kettle on.

360
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:43,402
Yeah, right. Don't overdo it.

361
00:59:46,739 --> 00:59:48,658
The princess is served.

362
00:59:54,455 --> 00:59:56,249
All yours. Because I should go.

363
00:59:57,583 --> 01:00:00,503
The princess slept all right?

364
01:00:00,545 --> 01:00:01,504
Yeah.

365
01:00:03,798 --> 01:00:06,300
So what do you say we invite Léon for dinner?

366
01:00:06,384 --> 01:00:07,677
Good.

367
01:00:10,346 --> 01:00:13,683
The guy's really been missing Britanny the past week.

368
01:00:13,724 --> 01:00:15,560
I'll make us crêpes.

369
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:17,645
Make crêpes? You?

370
01:00:20,147 --> 01:00:22,108
We might be partners soon.

371
01:00:22,108 --> 01:00:25,611
- Doing what? - We want to design boats.

372
01:00:25,695 --> 01:00:28,155
- You know how to swim? - Léon's a good guy.

373
01:00:30,032 --> 01:00:33,744
Yeah, but he can't find his way out of a paper bag.

374
01:00:33,911 --> 01:00:36,330
You're so cruel.

375
01:00:36,414 --> 01:00:40,042
- You might want to invite your friend. - Who's that?

376
01:00:40,042 --> 01:00:44,171
You told me you met one of your friends in a boutique. A blond...

377
01:00:44,255 --> 01:00:46,674
Last week, I think.

378
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:49,927
Yeah, but I wouldn't call her such a good friend.

379
01:00:50,011 --> 01:00:52,221
Invite her for dinner and you may become good friends.

380
01:00:52,305 --> 01:00:55,266
If it doesn't work out, she'll help Léon out of his bag.

381
01:01:07,278 --> 01:01:09,155
We're a good match.

382
01:01:11,824 --> 01:01:13,826
We've been together for six months.

383
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:27,256
Why don't you ever bring anyone home?

384
01:01:31,928 --> 01:01:36,182
No parents, no friends.

385
01:01:36,265 --> 01:01:37,516
Nobody.

386
01:01:42,188 --> 01:01:44,106
I only love you.

387
01:01:52,865 --> 01:01:55,243
Oh, no. Rescued just in time.

388
01:02:14,428 --> 01:02:17,390
- What? - The George V bar in one hour.

389
01:02:24,313 --> 01:02:25,147
Who's that?

390
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,068
Hospital. I'm on call.

391
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:46,919
Do you have a light?

392
01:02:47,044 --> 01:02:49,088
Downstairs at the Régina's in an hour.

393
01:03:19,702 --> 01:03:20,995
Don't move.

394
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:25,082
Your legs apart.

395
01:03:30,046 --> 01:03:32,548
Excuse me.

396
01:03:52,526 --> 01:03:53,778
That's for you.

397
01:04:31,649 --> 01:04:33,484
What do I do now?

398
01:04:34,610 --> 01:04:35,987
Sit down.

399
01:05:08,269 --> 01:05:10,021
Good morning. Room service.

400
01:05:14,108 --> 01:05:16,027
We'll be right up.

401
01:07:30,411 --> 01:07:32,788
Now what happens?

402
01:07:32,872 --> 01:07:34,874
You can go home.

403
01:07:37,251 --> 01:07:38,753
That's all?

404
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:12,328
- Yes? - It's Bob.

405
01:08:14,956 --> 01:08:19,418
- How are you? - I'm fine. Just fine.

406
01:08:19,418 --> 01:08:23,464
I just wanted to congratulate you. I'm glad your first job went so well.

407
01:08:25,258 --> 01:08:27,343
Thank you.

408
01:08:27,343 --> 01:08:29,262
Is everything else going well?

409
01:08:30,555 --> 01:08:32,557
Yeah, real well.

410
01:08:34,350 --> 01:08:36,602
I'm engaged.

411
01:08:36,727 --> 01:08:38,646
That's nice.

412
01:08:38,771 --> 01:08:41,190
I'm glad everything's working out for you.

413
01:08:41,190 --> 01:08:44,569
I have to go now. Good luck on your next assignment.

414
01:08:47,905 --> 01:08:48,865
Yes?

415
01:08:50,616 --> 01:08:52,952
I'd like you over for dinner at my place.

416
01:08:55,413 --> 01:08:57,373
I'd be delighted.

417
01:09:01,961 --> 01:09:03,921
Right? Uncle Bob.

418
01:09:05,798 --> 01:09:08,384
Come in. Nice tie. She's still getting ready.

419
01:09:09,886 --> 01:09:11,846
I'll give you a hand. You have your hands full.

420
01:09:11,971 --> 01:09:14,473
You shouldn't have. The flowers, I mean.

421
01:09:14,557 --> 01:09:16,767
Champagne suits me fine.

422
01:09:21,063 --> 01:09:23,900
I'm so pleased to get to...

423
01:09:23,900 --> 01:09:25,860
To know you. It's...

424
01:09:27,278 --> 01:09:30,698
You are the first member of the family I've met.

425
01:09:30,781 --> 01:09:32,658
The others are a pain in the butt.

426
01:09:39,957 --> 01:09:42,126
I better put it in the fridge while it's still warm.

427
01:09:46,339 --> 01:09:49,675
It's delicious, remarkable. It's so fine and light.

428
01:09:49,717 --> 01:09:52,845
Stop with all the compliments. My head's getting way too big.

429
01:09:52,970 --> 01:09:55,932
So one more little one, but that's all.

430
01:09:55,932 --> 01:09:58,976
I haven't seen her for a long time, and I just find her...

431
01:09:59,018 --> 01:10:01,687
I just find her radiant.

432
01:10:01,812 --> 01:10:05,483
- I have to give you credit. - I have a subterranean charm.

433
01:10:05,608 --> 01:10:08,027
Most aren't able to see it right away.

434
01:10:08,027 --> 01:10:11,113
You could go ten years without noticing.

435
01:10:11,197 --> 01:10:12,114
There.

436
01:10:19,622 --> 01:10:23,793
Tell me. You might not believe it, but I know nothing about her childhood.

437
01:10:25,962 --> 01:10:28,005
Tell me about when she was about ten.

438
01:10:28,047 --> 01:10:30,550
You promised.

439
01:10:30,591 --> 01:10:33,386
I promised I wouldn't ask you, not him.

440
01:10:33,386 --> 01:10:36,180
See? She won't let me ask you a single question.

441
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:38,724
Do I press you for things?

442
01:10:38,766 --> 01:10:40,977
Never, but I wouldn't mind.

443
01:10:41,102 --> 01:10:43,396
But I love you just the same.

444
01:10:43,396 --> 01:10:45,439
Yeah, well. You see? A brick wall.

445
01:10:45,523 --> 01:10:48,276
So I've heard.

446
01:10:49,861 --> 01:10:52,321
She was so beautiful then.

447
01:10:57,368 --> 01:11:00,371
She wore pigtails when she was only eight.

448
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:04,041
And she always hung around with her cousin Caroline.

449
01:11:04,709 --> 01:11:07,461
And only Caroline could braid Marie's pigtail.

450
01:11:07,461 --> 01:11:09,463
No one else.

451
01:11:12,842 --> 01:11:14,886
She always had a ribbon in her hair...

452
01:11:14,969 --> 01:11:16,846
and she only wore white dresses.

453
01:11:20,641 --> 01:11:22,810
I only saw her in the summer...

454
01:11:22,852 --> 01:11:25,104
when the family would rent a house in the country.

455
01:11:25,104 --> 01:11:27,148
Counting all the cousins and neighbors...

456
01:11:27,231 --> 01:11:30,651
there were at least 20 kids running around getting into trouble.

457
01:11:35,323 --> 01:11:37,825
Marie had a very special talent...

458
01:11:37,950 --> 01:11:39,285
imitating frogs.

459
01:11:43,331 --> 01:11:46,792
She'd sneak down to the pond whenever she could.

460
01:11:46,959 --> 01:11:50,504
She'd jump in the mud croaking until every kid fell down laughing.

461
01:11:51,881 --> 01:11:55,426
She'd come back, dripping and soaking wet...

462
01:11:55,468 --> 01:11:59,222
and every time she would use the same excuse.

463
01:11:59,263 --> 01:12:01,891
"It was just an accident"...

464
01:12:01,933 --> 01:12:03,935
with that small voice she had.

465
01:12:06,604 --> 01:12:08,981
She hasn't changed much, you know.

466
01:12:09,065 --> 01:12:11,400
Has Marie ever told you what I do for a living?

467
01:12:14,779 --> 01:12:16,864
I'm not allowed to ask any questions.

468
01:12:18,699 --> 01:12:21,035
I've been working as a travel agent.

469
01:12:21,035 --> 01:12:23,996
It includes some nice perks here and there.

470
01:12:24,038 --> 01:12:26,624
Two tickets for Venice.

471
01:12:29,544 --> 01:12:31,379
It's my engagement present.

472
01:12:38,344 --> 01:12:41,430
- I don't know what to say. - Well, say nothing.

473
01:13:03,619 --> 01:13:05,663
Real wood.

474
01:13:06,706 --> 01:13:08,457
I'm talking to myself.

475
01:13:19,886 --> 01:13:21,846
Look at me!

476
01:13:43,784 --> 01:13:45,745
Watch your step.

477
01:13:49,081 --> 01:13:50,750
Thank you.

478
01:13:50,750 --> 01:13:52,084
This way.

479
01:13:56,088 --> 01:13:58,090
Oh, no, not more gondola.

480
01:13:58,966 --> 01:14:00,843
More gondola, more gondola.

481
01:14:03,346 --> 01:14:08,142
Gondolier...

482
01:14:08,184 --> 01:14:11,479
from Venice!

483
01:14:16,025 --> 01:14:17,777
I want you.

484
01:14:17,818 --> 01:14:19,654
- I'm thirsty too. - Me too.

485
01:14:19,695 --> 01:14:21,822
- Hungry too. - Me too.

486
01:14:21,864 --> 01:14:23,824
Copycat. Pull off my skirt.

487
01:14:23,866 --> 01:14:25,826
Right away.

488
01:14:27,537 --> 01:14:29,914
Now come on. Pull!

489
01:14:39,048 --> 01:14:41,008
Hold this up for me.

490
01:14:43,553 --> 01:14:47,348
We'd like one side order of ham San Daniele, one assortment of cheese...

491
01:14:47,473 --> 01:14:51,727
and two bottles of water because we sweat like pigs when we make love.

492
01:14:53,854 --> 01:14:55,648
She's crazy.

493
01:14:58,234 --> 01:15:00,736
What did they have to say?

494
01:15:00,736 --> 01:15:03,114
They should have the same problem at home.

495
01:15:06,534 --> 01:15:08,536
It's good to be here.

496
01:15:15,084 --> 01:15:16,544
Don't budge.

497
01:15:30,391 --> 01:15:31,851
Yeah.

498
01:15:31,976 --> 01:15:35,021
There's a secret compartment in the bathroom cabinet.

499
01:15:44,238 --> 01:15:47,909
All right. Make it a green salad instead, please.

500
01:15:49,035 --> 01:15:50,494
Thank you.

501
01:15:58,252 --> 01:16:00,504
There is no more San Daniele.

502
01:16:00,671 --> 01:16:02,506
Get me the manager.

503
01:16:05,927 --> 01:16:07,720
I'm gonna pour a bath.

504
01:16:08,846 --> 01:16:11,057
Just relax and take care of room service.

505
01:16:51,389 --> 01:16:53,891
Joséphine in position.

506
01:16:53,933 --> 01:16:56,185
The first elements are under the sink.

507
01:17:45,651 --> 01:17:46,903
Assembly complete.

508
01:17:46,944 --> 01:17:48,905
Open the window.

509
01:17:54,577 --> 01:17:58,331
- How am I supposed to open the window? - You'll work it out.

510
01:18:02,001 --> 01:18:02,919
Sweetheart?

511
01:18:05,213 --> 01:18:06,172
What?

512
01:18:06,172 --> 01:18:08,466
You know what I'm thinking?

513
01:18:11,093 --> 01:18:14,096
Of the moment I first saw you in the store. You were so beautiful.

514
01:18:14,096 --> 01:18:16,682
I thought, "Life can play such dirty tricks...

515
01:18:16,724 --> 01:18:19,852
because I'll never have a girl like that to share my life.

516
01:18:19,936 --> 01:18:21,938
To be with me.

517
01:18:24,524 --> 01:18:26,317
Never."

518
01:18:32,073 --> 01:18:35,159
Now we are both here. Together.

519
01:18:40,540 --> 01:18:42,458
There's a white boat on the canal...

520
01:18:42,542 --> 01:18:45,419
with a driver in a blue shirt.

521
01:18:45,461 --> 01:18:49,924
To the left, there are two people waiting outside a door.

522
01:18:50,091 --> 01:18:51,968
Take aim and be ready.

523
01:18:52,134 --> 01:18:54,178
We're waiting for orders.

524
01:19:08,818 --> 01:19:11,946
- Yeah? - Can we talk?

525
01:19:12,029 --> 01:19:13,990
Okay, but don't come in.

526
01:19:25,543 --> 01:19:28,087
I don't want to bother you with my questions.

527
01:19:29,964 --> 01:19:32,091
I don't know...

528
01:19:32,174 --> 01:19:35,928
what you did or what happened that got you to this point...

529
01:19:36,012 --> 01:19:37,889
so wound up.

530
01:19:40,224 --> 01:19:43,477
But I think about it once in a while, you know?

531
01:19:43,519 --> 01:19:45,354
And I imagine the worst.

532
01:19:48,399 --> 01:19:50,359
The worst would be a relief.

533
01:19:58,075 --> 01:20:00,036
- What is it? - Room service.

534
01:20:01,996 --> 01:20:02,955
Coming.

535
01:20:10,922 --> 01:20:13,341
Stop, stop. I thought you were out of ham.

536
01:20:14,717 --> 01:20:16,844
Never mind. No big deal.

537
01:20:17,887 --> 01:20:21,265
- How many targets? - Only one, but two shots.

538
01:20:21,265 --> 01:20:24,602
- How do I single him out? - I don't have that information yet.

539
01:20:33,986 --> 01:20:36,697
Stand by. Target will be visible in ten seconds.

540
01:20:46,707 --> 01:20:51,003
- Which one is he? - I don't have that information yet.

541
01:20:53,256 --> 01:20:56,634
- Which one, damn it? - The woman.

542
01:20:56,717 --> 01:20:58,427
The woman in brown.

543
01:20:58,511 --> 01:20:59,971
The woman, damn it!

544
01:21:00,137 --> 01:21:01,681
What are you doing? The woman!

545
01:21:11,357 --> 01:21:13,442
What's wrong? Why don't you answer?

546
01:21:13,484 --> 01:21:15,862
You promised not to come in.

547
01:21:15,987 --> 01:21:17,947
I know, but I heard some noise.

548
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:21,284
Damn it, for half an hour I've been talking from behind the door.

549
01:21:21,367 --> 01:21:23,327
You might answer me.

550
01:21:38,634 --> 01:21:40,511
You didn't hear a word?

551
01:21:54,275 --> 01:21:55,985
All right.

552
01:21:58,112 --> 01:22:00,031
Here. For the road.

553
01:22:54,001 --> 01:22:55,920
Miss?

554
01:22:56,045 --> 01:22:58,589
Chocolate. Thank you.

555
01:23:04,554 --> 01:23:08,808
Want to know how I spent my vacation, is that it?

556
01:23:08,891 --> 01:23:12,812
I'm getting to know you and your sadistic ways.

557
01:23:13,479 --> 01:23:15,398
You're mad.

558
01:23:15,523 --> 01:23:18,317
Totally sick.

559
01:23:18,442 --> 01:23:20,736
You just used me to play your cruel little game.

560
01:23:23,114 --> 01:23:25,032
It's so good to see you.

561
01:23:29,579 --> 01:23:33,666
I'm guess I'm nostalgic for the times I had you all to myself.

562
01:23:33,833 --> 01:23:36,502
It's an ambassador. In six months, he returns home.

563
01:23:36,502 --> 01:23:39,797
You have to get him before he leaves. It's your show. Choose your team.

564
01:23:39,839 --> 01:23:43,175
You have six months. They want a nice, clean job.

565
01:23:43,259 --> 01:23:45,136
I thought of you.

566
01:23:51,100 --> 01:23:53,269
You're always combining two things at once.

567
01:23:54,729 --> 01:23:56,731
The vagaries of love.

568
01:24:31,349 --> 01:24:33,809
Not impressed with your new plant?

569
01:24:41,234 --> 01:24:43,361
There we are. That's much better.

570
01:24:46,781 --> 01:24:50,409
No more Mr. Cashier because after today, I'm finished.

571
01:24:50,868 --> 01:24:52,453
- I quit. - You'll make boats?

572
01:24:52,578 --> 01:24:54,789
- You bet I will. - Let's celebrate.

573
01:24:54,830 --> 01:24:56,290
But of course.

574
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,764
Who taught you how to smile like that?

575
01:25:11,806 --> 01:25:12,765
You did.

576
01:25:15,434 --> 01:25:17,895
I think we should move.

577
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:22,817
I believe that something more spacious would suit you better.

578
01:26:02,064 --> 01:26:05,067
He went into number nine to see one of his mistresses.

579
01:26:05,109 --> 01:26:07,069
It'll be about a two-hour wait.

580
01:26:10,990 --> 01:26:12,909
You have a light?

581
01:26:12,909 --> 01:26:14,952
See you later.

582
01:26:25,713 --> 01:26:27,673
Sorry, I got held up.

583
01:26:30,676 --> 01:26:34,847
Maximilien Jedreck. Stationed in Paris for seven years.

584
01:26:34,889 --> 01:26:36,891
He acquires information from all parties...

585
01:26:36,933 --> 01:26:39,894
keeps it in a safe at the embassy until he can take it home with him.

586
01:26:39,894 --> 01:26:41,187
Classic.

587
01:26:42,188 --> 01:26:45,107
- What kind of information? - All kinds.

588
01:26:45,107 --> 01:26:47,235
Governmental, scientific, corporate.

589
01:26:49,570 --> 01:26:51,697
Who's the girl?

590
01:26:51,739 --> 01:26:54,825
Anne-Marie something or other. They've dated about two years.

591
01:26:54,867 --> 01:26:57,453
She sells paintings. Apparently, she's clean.

592
01:26:59,789 --> 01:27:02,041
In fact, we're not really interested in him.

593
01:27:03,251 --> 01:27:07,296
What we really want is to get the companies that are selling him the data.

594
01:27:07,380 --> 01:27:10,424
To get them, we need proof.

595
01:27:10,466 --> 01:27:13,010
And all that proof's in the embassy safe, right?

596
01:27:13,094 --> 01:27:17,473
- Yeah, and the keys are in his pocket. - At least we know where to look.

597
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:22,645
Right now, relations with the embassy are rather strained, so go easy.

598
01:27:22,770 --> 01:27:24,772
You can't hurt the ambassador.

599
01:27:24,897 --> 01:27:27,650
It should be a finesse job, not a tour de force.

600
01:27:44,083 --> 01:27:45,543
Anybody home?

601
01:28:04,979 --> 01:28:07,106
You shouldn't scare me like that.

602
01:28:25,291 --> 01:28:28,419
How can you work at a hospital and still smell so damn good?

603
01:28:30,004 --> 01:28:31,923
Strong perfume.

604
01:28:37,678 --> 01:28:41,182
You've worked midnights for three months but you tell me nothing about it.

605
01:28:43,434 --> 01:28:45,061
Tonight it's over.

606
01:30:24,035 --> 01:30:26,579
It's much more work than I thought.

607
01:30:26,662 --> 01:30:28,581
She told me you might be here.

608
01:30:35,630 --> 01:30:38,299
Marie-Hélène. Didn't she tell you?

609
01:30:42,386 --> 01:30:44,263
No, she didn't.

610
01:30:59,612 --> 01:31:01,948
I'll just be two minutes.

611
01:31:18,005 --> 01:31:19,966
Well, what do you think of it?

612
01:31:24,971 --> 01:31:26,847
It's okay.

613
01:31:26,847 --> 01:31:31,519
Carrying it up five stories will make a painting worth twice as much.

614
01:31:31,644 --> 01:31:33,604
What can I get you to drink?

615
01:31:34,897 --> 01:31:36,816
Some whiskey.

616
01:31:52,707 --> 01:31:56,294
You have worked with Anne-Marie how long?

617
01:31:56,294 --> 01:31:58,921
Every now and then. My father owns a gallery near hers.

618
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:01,257
On the same avenue?

619
01:32:01,340 --> 01:32:03,301
Yeah, but up a block.

620
01:32:07,972 --> 01:32:09,932
Up a block, up a block.

621
01:32:17,231 --> 01:32:19,150
Ah, of course.

622
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:22,278
Many thanks.

623
01:32:23,446 --> 01:32:25,990
It's up just past the gallery of Finland.

624
01:32:27,033 --> 01:32:28,993
Ah, you've been there.

625
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:31,120
Drink it.

626
01:32:33,539 --> 01:32:35,124
Glug, glug.

627
01:32:46,802 --> 01:32:49,764
Now down on the couch. You're gonna sleep a little.

628
01:33:19,001 --> 01:33:22,755
Christian, it's just a cleaning lady on her way up.

629
01:33:22,964 --> 01:33:24,590
Okay, I've got it.

630
01:33:39,105 --> 01:33:40,982
Yeah?

631
01:33:40,982 --> 01:33:43,693
The ambassador uses a password with his guards.

632
01:33:43,818 --> 01:33:46,863
- But we know the password. - They changed it this morning.

633
01:33:46,904 --> 01:33:50,700
We just got word from surveillance.

634
01:33:50,825 --> 01:33:53,828
- So we have to call it off? - Hold on. I'll find out.

635
01:34:09,218 --> 01:34:11,846
- No, the mission is maintained. - How do I do that?

636
01:34:11,846 --> 01:34:14,307
Wait there. We're sending in a cleanup man.

637
01:34:16,726 --> 01:34:18,853
Look, it's my mission. For six months...

638
01:34:18,895 --> 01:34:20,938
Shut up. Orders are orders.

639
01:34:20,980 --> 01:34:24,609
The mission is maintained with maximum priority. Understand?

640
01:34:24,692 --> 01:34:28,613
You can shove your stinking cleanup man!

641
01:34:32,241 --> 01:34:34,243
It's not safe. Shouldn't we go?

642
01:34:38,164 --> 01:34:41,167
No, let's talk to the man.

643
01:35:06,234 --> 01:35:07,652
Maurice?

644
01:35:15,326 --> 01:35:17,203
Maurice, who's coming up?

645
01:35:35,888 --> 01:35:38,391
- I'm fine. - Keep calm.

646
01:35:38,432 --> 01:35:39,892
I'm fine!

647
01:35:41,018 --> 01:35:43,896
I'll get it.

648
01:35:46,399 --> 01:35:48,401
Victor, the cleaner.

649
01:35:57,535 --> 01:36:00,371
- Where's the bathroom? - Over there.

650
01:36:00,496 --> 01:36:02,373
Bring me the guy on the couch.

651
01:36:14,051 --> 01:36:16,095
- And the chauffeur? - In the trunk.

652
01:36:18,681 --> 01:36:21,601
- Talk to the man. He's right there! - You stupid idiot!

653
01:36:21,684 --> 01:36:23,686
You want to end up dead too?

654
01:36:36,449 --> 01:36:39,076
Victor, we've got to make a plan.

655
01:36:39,160 --> 01:36:40,745
No plans.

656
01:36:43,372 --> 01:36:45,166
What is that stuff for, then?

657
01:36:45,249 --> 01:36:48,127
To save your ass.

658
01:36:49,128 --> 01:36:50,963
You bastards! I thought you'd killed him.

659
01:36:55,384 --> 01:36:58,679
- You're an absolute maniac! - Hold him down!

660
01:36:58,763 --> 01:37:01,098
- I'm through! - Get over here.

661
01:37:01,182 --> 01:37:03,309
Take this, and this! It's over!

662
01:37:03,392 --> 01:37:06,562
Shut the fuck up. Finish him off.

663
01:37:06,604 --> 01:37:09,565
You can go to the embassy yourself! Here! Take the keys!

664
01:37:09,732 --> 01:37:13,903
- Finish him off! - I'll finish him off!

665
01:37:46,978 --> 01:37:49,480
Maybe I should call them for further instructions.

666
01:37:56,737 --> 01:37:59,657
I am not about to stop this mission.

667
01:37:59,782 --> 01:38:01,951
There will be no phone calls.

668
01:38:02,034 --> 01:38:06,622
We'll finish this mission, or you're going with the others. Is that clear?

669
01:38:35,902 --> 01:38:39,447
- Maybe I should come with you. - You'd better not.

670
01:38:39,447 --> 01:38:42,241
Just stay here. I'll be one hour.

671
01:38:42,325 --> 01:38:45,995
And please calm down. Calm down.

672
01:38:45,995 --> 01:38:47,705
Fine, but only an hour.

673
01:42:41,898 --> 01:42:43,482
You can't be done.

674
01:42:47,653 --> 01:42:49,989
I'm finishing this off now.

675
01:42:49,989 --> 01:42:52,909
We've got what we needed to get.

676
01:42:52,950 --> 01:42:56,662
If we can drive out, that's all.

677
01:42:56,746 --> 01:42:58,164
All right?

678
01:43:01,167 --> 01:43:03,085
Let's finish the mission.

679
01:43:05,963 --> 01:43:09,717
No, please. Time's up.

680
01:43:10,718 --> 01:43:13,846
Let's go home. Please.

681
01:43:18,184 --> 01:43:20,811
- And who is this guy? - It doesn't matter.

682
01:43:21,729 --> 01:43:24,357
Ambassador, is there something wrong?

683
01:43:25,149 --> 01:43:26,734
My God.

684
01:43:31,989 --> 01:43:34,909
Let's get out!

685
01:43:42,959 --> 01:43:44,502
The guards are in place.

686
01:43:46,170 --> 01:43:49,131
It's nothing. It's a false alarm. Stay calm.

687
01:44:02,854 --> 01:44:05,857
They've shut the gate. We'll be trapped in here.

688
01:44:07,233 --> 01:44:08,401
We'll be back.

689
01:44:08,526 --> 01:44:09,902
Halt!

690
01:44:13,489 --> 01:44:16,826
- Around the block, then right back. - They'll kill us!

691
01:46:08,020 --> 01:46:09,522
Move over.

692
01:46:27,748 --> 01:46:29,834
Look at me, Marie.

693
01:46:43,055 --> 01:46:45,016
My poor, dear Marie.

694
01:46:47,852 --> 01:46:49,687
They've worn you out.

695
01:46:51,856 --> 01:46:54,066
This job isn't for you. It's too hard.

696
01:46:56,485 --> 01:46:58,487
It's time to stop it.

697
01:46:59,697 --> 01:47:01,699
You mean so much to me.

698
01:47:05,578 --> 01:47:08,247
And I want to take care of you.

699
01:47:11,751 --> 01:47:14,921
Life together is too valuable for us to risk.

700
01:47:18,633 --> 01:47:20,635
Why are you saying this?

701
01:47:25,223 --> 01:47:27,225
It's the truth.

702
01:47:30,436 --> 01:47:33,314
There's no Marie Clément at the hospital.

703
01:47:33,397 --> 01:47:35,399
I know what's going on.

704
01:47:38,778 --> 01:47:40,738
How much you go through.

705
01:47:43,533 --> 01:47:45,826
The spying, the surveillance...

706
01:47:45,910 --> 01:47:47,286
the videotapes.

707
01:47:49,956 --> 01:47:51,958
Why haven't you said anything?

708
01:47:54,919 --> 01:47:56,879
I only love you.

709
01:48:02,844 --> 01:48:05,888
Thank you. Thank you.

710
01:48:23,489 --> 01:48:25,408
My sweet Marco.

711
01:48:30,621 --> 01:48:33,666
The world has given me only this one taste of love.

712
01:48:38,838 --> 01:48:41,799
And I will remember you always.

713
01:48:48,681 --> 01:48:50,183
You're leaving tonight?

714
01:49:02,111 --> 01:49:04,030
Maybe you'll let me come too.

715
01:49:05,907 --> 01:49:08,117
I want you to stay.

716
01:49:32,642 --> 01:49:34,602
I love you.

717
01:50:42,211 --> 01:50:45,548
Mathieu, I'll go first.

718
01:50:45,548 --> 01:50:47,508
I'll call if there's a problem.

719
01:51:00,188 --> 01:51:01,856
No flowers this time?

720
01:51:09,614 --> 01:51:11,574
For how long has she...

721
01:51:12,617 --> 01:51:14,535
Hasn't she paid her debt?

722
01:51:16,287 --> 01:51:19,248
Can't she have her own life anymore?

723
01:51:21,792 --> 01:51:25,213
- You destroyed her life. - I know what I've done.

724
01:51:25,254 --> 01:51:28,883
But you should know that she also destroyed a life.

725
01:51:28,925 --> 01:51:31,427
A cop's life.

726
01:51:31,469 --> 01:51:33,513
And that's too hard to forget.

727
01:51:35,515 --> 01:51:37,517
She killed how many for you?

728
01:51:37,517 --> 01:51:39,936
Why does it only count when it suits you?

729
01:51:48,861 --> 01:51:51,030
Maybe you do understand the situation.

730
01:51:51,197 --> 01:51:55,159
Fine, then. I'll listen. Ask yourself how we save her.

731
01:51:56,118 --> 01:51:57,954
Can't you protect her?

732
01:52:00,581 --> 01:52:03,125
I'll try...

733
01:52:03,334 --> 01:52:06,546
but she's forced me to hunt her.

734
01:52:06,587 --> 01:52:08,881
Because we must have all the embassy documents.

735
01:52:09,549 --> 01:52:13,678
Her troubles are over, then, because I have them with me here.

736
01:52:40,454 --> 01:52:43,541
She left a note for you with it, but I tore it up.

737
01:52:47,044 --> 01:52:48,796
What did it say?

738
01:53:10,818 --> 01:53:12,570
I think we'll miss her.

739
01:53:19,285 --> 01:53:20,203
Yeah.
