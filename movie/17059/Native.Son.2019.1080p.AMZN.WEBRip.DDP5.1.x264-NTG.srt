00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:05,166
You guys have that
Bad Rage vinyl?

168
00:13:11,667 --> 00:13:12,834
Right here, man.

169
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,458
How much is that?

170
00:13:15,542 --> 00:13:19,834
This, man? There's one
in the Smithsonian.

171
00:13:25,834 --> 00:13:27,792
So, you in or what?

172
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:30,166
I don't know, Jack.

173
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,792
Man, what you mean
you don't know, man?

174
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,875
It's easy money.

175
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:37,000
I don't know.

176
00:13:45,083 --> 00:13:46,291
Listen,

177
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,417
I got all the details
worked out.

178
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,917
Old Blum ain't got nobody
in the store, ten a.m.

179
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,208
Everybody gone wherever,

180
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:54,625
everybody picked up they
newspapers and all that.

181
00:13:54,709 --> 00:13:56,834
Cops don't circle back
until 10:30,

182
00:13:56,917 --> 00:13:59,077
so that gives us thirty
whole minutes to hit that shit.

183
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,583
You tryin' to rob
a corner store at gunpoint?

184
00:14:05,208 --> 00:14:06,583
I'm sorry, I'm not interested

185
00:14:06,667 --> 00:14:08,959
in being a part of some

186
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:11,375
least common denominator
stereotypical Negro shit.

187
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,041
You ain't gotta
call it that, man.

188
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,417
Well, that's what it is, though.

189
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,083
Look, this ain't
a nickel-and-dime robbery.

190
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,959
I got all the details
worked out, bro, trust me.

191
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:25,083
I'll think about it, all right?

192
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,500
Get off the fuckin' stage!

193
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:01,709
Excuse me,
do you guys have tickets?

194
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:06,125
- Tony. Bullshit.
- You all right, Tony.

195
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,750
Yo, Tony, want to hear about
how we gon' hit Blum's?

196
00:15:14,834 --> 00:15:16,625
Not right now, man.

197
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,625
Yeah, I hear that shit.

198
00:15:21,709 --> 00:15:24,069
Y'all niggas always talk about
how you want something to do,

199
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:25,583
and now I got something.

200
00:15:25,667 --> 00:15:29,041
Anybody can tell you that
don't add up to a dollar.

201
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:32,333
Nigga, shut the fuck up and
watch the fuckin' movie, bro.

202
00:15:32,417 --> 00:15:33,834
Fuck y'all niggas, man.

203
00:15:38,667 --> 00:15:40,291
So, Big, what kind
of music you into?

204
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,250
You like that hip-hop?

205
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,625
What is it?

206
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:46,375
Nas, Jay-Z, Biggie or Tupac?

207
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:47,834
I like Kanye.

208
00:15:47,917 --> 00:15:49,792
Marty was asking Big.

209
00:15:50,792 --> 00:15:53,291
None of the above, man.

210
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:58,041
What about sports? The Bulls?

211
00:15:58,125 --> 00:16:00,750
You know, I know a guy
that can get me some tickets.

212
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:03,750
Maybe it'd be nice if the two
of us go to a game sometime.

213
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:07,458
No, you know, sports
were more like,

214
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:10,250
my dad's thing.

215
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:13,208
Know?

216
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,417
Right?

217
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,917
Yeah, more like a dad thing.

218
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,667
Y'all two getting serious?

219
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,291
Your mother's a wonderful woman.

220
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,709
As the three of you know.

221
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,041
Marty thinks I should
go to law school.

222
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,917
You're a great paralegal.
You should take the next step.

223
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,625
So y'all will both be lawyers.

224
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:50,166
Yeah, well, not all
lawyers make the big bucks.

225
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:55,041
I mostly work with the non-
profits, that kind of thing.

226
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,583
Tell him about the job, hon.

227
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:07,583
It's an excellent opportunity.

228
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:09,667
What is it, office work?

229
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:12,542
One of our biggest clients
is looking for a new driver.

230
00:17:12,625 --> 00:17:14,000
That sounds so boring.

231
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,041
That's 'cause you
don't drive, stupid.

232
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:19,458
Who's the client?

233
00:17:19,542 --> 00:17:20,750
Will Dalton.

234
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:23,166
He owns, like, every
building in the city.

235
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:26,083
And he's had the same driver
for twenty years.

236
00:17:27,417 --> 00:17:30,000
Sounds like a great job,
good pay.

237
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:32,792
Full benefits package.

238
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,959
So, you interested
in the job, son?

239
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:37,041
I don't know.

240
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,291
I mean, I...

241
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,500
It's not mine yet.
I still gotta...

242
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,458
go in and do the interview
and all of that.

243
00:17:43,542 --> 00:17:46,041
So, is the interview
at the Dalton Building?

244
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,583
No, it's at his home office.

245
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,625
I'll think about it.

246
00:17:57,333 --> 00:18:01,583
New game. Same old rules.

247
00:18:01,667 --> 00:18:05,709
Brand-new game. Same old shit.

248
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:07,959
What was that...

249
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:11,250
The only thing
I remember from school...

250
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:13,250
"panem et circenses."

251
00:18:13,333 --> 00:18:16,667
Bread and circus.

252
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,291
Keep them fed
and entertained and stupid,

253
00:18:20,375 --> 00:18:24,959
and, that way, you can
keep them where you want them.

254
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:28,750
You and Big serious?

255
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:30,542
We together.

256
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,667
You should be with someone
who's got more going on.

257
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,333
What, like you and Gus?

258
00:18:35,417 --> 00:18:38,250
Yeah. Gus has got a future.

259
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,000
Big's cool and all,

260
00:18:40,083 --> 00:18:42,375
but... he's more like
a fixer-upper.

261
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:46,125
He's a wild card,
and he don't need fixin'.

262
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:48,917
When they made Big,

263
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,959
they broke the mold.

264
00:18:57,959 --> 00:18:59,917
Hey, y'all know that
up there is me, right?

265
00:19:06,417 --> 00:19:07,917
How you doin'?

266
00:19:11,291 --> 00:19:13,041
Who is that?

267
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,625
White girls like poodles.

268
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:25,500
They go to bed with anybody.

269
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,083
Is you gon' look at her
all night?

270
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,542
Shit, I'd rather be
lookin' at you, baby.

271
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,083
Well, you weren't.

272
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,250
Hey...

273
00:19:46,625 --> 00:19:49,125
It's me and you, all right?

274
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:57,875
Oh, fuck.

275
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,458
Hey, look, I'm telling you,

276
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:11,875
Blum's store is
a cash-only business.

277
00:20:11,959 --> 00:20:15,834
And they got money in the
till ripe for the taking.

278
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,417
I mean, and it'd give us
a way to prove ourselves.

279
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,041
We ain't
in high school no more, man.

280
00:20:26,125 --> 00:20:27,925
I mean, shit, I got a son
I gotta take care of

281
00:20:27,950 --> 00:20:30,117
and a job I gotta do, every day.

282
00:20:31,959 --> 00:20:33,458
Suit yourself.

283
00:20:36,959 --> 00:20:37,834
Big?

284
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:42,166
What's Gus say?

285
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:44,500
Got "A," got "B," got "E."

286
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:46,250
Shit, I got the whole
damn alphabet.

287
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,750
Yeah, I don't know.
I don't think Gus is in.

288
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,625
Yeah, that's 'cause Gus
don't need the opportunity.

289
00:20:57,709 --> 00:21:00,125
Just me, you, Big.

290
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,166
You got it all planned out?

291
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,166
Man, it's like we practically
already done it.

292
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:13,000
Yeah, home... I don't know, bro.

293
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,208
Know, it... it ain't for me.

294
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:17,417
Yeah.

295
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,291
You don't want
to nothin' authentic.

296
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,625
Instead of looking
and acting like a real brother,

297
00:21:24,709 --> 00:21:27,333
you have to run around
fronting like a fucking clown.

298
00:21:29,834 --> 00:21:33,166
I'll meet you whenever...

299
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,166
and rob whatever.

300
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:41,000
Name the time and place.

301
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:46,208
Next Tuesday, a week from today,

302
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:48,083
ten in the morning.

303
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,542
Done.

304
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,417
You really gon'
rob that store with Jack?

305
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,250
I told him I would.

306
00:22:05,375 --> 00:22:06,333
Hey.

307
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:10,166
You want me to stay the night?

308
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,208
Maybe tomorrow night.

309
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:16,792
What about that job offer
from your mom?

310
00:22:18,542 --> 00:22:19,458

Yes, ma'am.

328
00:24:11,166 --> 00:24:12,625
I'm Peggy, come in.

329
00:24:12,709 --> 00:24:13,667
Thanks.

330
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:34,917
You'll get used to it.

331
00:24:39,542 --> 00:24:41,291
Wait here.

332
00:24:41,375 --> 00:24:42,333
All right.

333
00:24:42,417 --> 00:24:44,291
You can sit down.

334
00:24:44,375 --> 00:24:45,333
OK.

335
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:09,625
Great of you
to come by this morning.

336
00:25:12,333 --> 00:25:15,208
- Will Dalton.
- Thank you for having me, sir.

337
00:25:15,291 --> 00:25:18,375
No "sir," just Dalton.

338
00:25:18,458 --> 00:25:20,542
Thank you for having me,
Mr. Dalton.

339
00:25:21,709 --> 00:25:23,041
You can come on this way.

340
00:25:23,125 --> 00:25:24,875
All right.

341
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:31,875
So, you all been
living here a long time?

342
00:25:31,959 --> 00:25:34,458
The house has been
in the family for generations.

343
00:25:36,333 --> 00:25:37,375
Is everything OK?

344
00:25:37,458 --> 00:25:39,500
I wanted to meet our new driver.

345
00:25:39,583 --> 00:25:43,041
Mr. Thomas, meet my beautiful
young wife, Mrs. Dalton.

346
00:25:43,125 --> 00:25:44,834
It's a pleasure.

347
00:25:44,917 --> 00:25:46,917
Did you find
the house all right?

348
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,333
Yeah. Yes. Yes, ma'am.

349
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:55,041
You didn't get lost.

350
00:25:55,125 --> 00:25:56,959
Not at all, ma'am.

351
00:25:57,041 --> 00:26:00,000
Marty says you are
a wonderful young man.

352
00:26:02,583 --> 00:26:04,375
Do you enjoy driving?

353
00:26:04,458 --> 00:26:06,959
Very much, ma'am.

354
00:26:07,041 --> 00:26:09,667
Well, it's settled, then.

355
00:26:14,542 --> 00:26:16,208
Let's head into my office.

356
00:26:16,291 --> 00:26:19,208
It's a pleasure
having you in our home.

357
00:26:19,291 --> 00:26:20,667
Nice to meet you.

358
00:26:32,583 --> 00:26:34,667
She hasn't always been blind.

359
00:26:40,959 --> 00:26:42,375
Have a seat.

360
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:57,333
No computer?

361
00:26:57,417 --> 00:26:58,792
I'm a total Luddite.

362
00:26:58,875 --> 00:27:00,083
I feel that.

363
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,792
I prefer cassettes to CDs.

364
00:27:02,875 --> 00:27:04,291
We're on the same page.

365
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:05,583
Yeah.

366
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:09,125
- Your resume?
- Yes.

367
00:27:09,208 --> 00:27:11,792
It's not really... up to date.

368
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:13,417
That's fine.

369
00:27:15,583 --> 00:27:17,166
Marty says you're a good guy.

370
00:27:18,834 --> 00:27:21,083
So, my security guy,

371
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:25,792
he insists that I do
a thorough background check.

372
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:27,709
OK.

373
00:27:39,709 --> 00:27:40,667
Clean record.

374
00:27:44,208 --> 00:27:45,417
Well, yeah.

375
00:27:47,083 --> 00:27:48,375
You're a good driver?

376
00:27:48,458 --> 00:27:49,959
The best.

377
00:27:50,041 --> 00:27:51,917
I-I've never even
run a red light.

378
00:27:53,041 --> 00:27:54,583
That's what they say.

379
00:28:02,458 --> 00:28:03,875
Your first name is Bigger.

380
00:28:03,959 --> 00:28:07,000
Yeah. My friends call me Big.

381
00:28:07,083 --> 00:28:10,333
- Not Biggie?
- After Biggie Smalls? Nah.

382
00:28:10,417 --> 00:28:14,333
Good, seeing how Christopher
Wallace came to a difficult end.

383
00:28:17,917 --> 00:28:20,041
Are you nearsighted
or farsighted?

384
00:28:20,125 --> 00:28:24,667
I wear them for driving,
but they're not strong.

385
00:28:24,750 --> 00:28:27,458
They're just to...
make things...

386
00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:29,250
Clearer. Right.

387
00:28:30,917 --> 00:28:32,125
Right.

388
00:28:39,375 --> 00:28:40,625
No, sit down.

389
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,125
So, you'll have a room here,
on the top floor of the house.

390
00:28:51,208 --> 00:28:53,542
You'll have your meals
here too, of course.

391
00:28:53,625 --> 00:28:54,709
Right.

392
00:28:54,792 --> 00:28:56,917
You'll make a thousand
dollars a week.

393
00:28:57,959 --> 00:28:59,291
You got any questions so far?

394
00:28:59,375 --> 00:29:00,959
None at all.

395
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,625
I'm usually at the office
by eight a.m.

396
00:29:04,709 --> 00:29:07,667
Then you'll be on duty to take Miss
Dalton, our daughter,

397
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,917
to the university.

398
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,667
Her class schedule, it varies.

399
00:29:10,750 --> 00:29:13,750
But during the day, should Mrs.
Dalton want to go out,

400
00:29:13,834 --> 00:29:15,250
you'll take her.

401
00:29:15,333 --> 00:29:16,625
Think you can handle all that?

402
00:29:16,709 --> 00:29:17,667
Yeah.

403
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:21,792
One question:

404
00:29:21,875 --> 00:29:24,208
You guys want me to cut my hair?

405
00:29:24,291 --> 00:29:26,875
It's fine just as it is.

406
00:29:28,208 --> 00:29:29,417
Is that good?

407
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,125
Yeah.

408
00:29:32,166 --> 00:29:34,166
Job is yours, Bigger.

409
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:36,750
Great.

410
00:29:36,834 --> 00:29:39,125
Mr. Greene, our last driver,

411
00:29:39,208 --> 00:29:41,041
he did very well here.

412
00:29:41,125 --> 00:29:43,000
We hope you will too.

413
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:44,917
I plan to.

414
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,417
Dad?

415
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,083
Mom said you were interviewing.

416
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,333
I already hired him.

417
00:29:49,417 --> 00:29:51,250
Bigger Thomas,

418
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:52,750
this is my daughter Mary.

419
00:29:52,834 --> 00:29:53,834
Hi.

420
00:29:53,917 --> 00:29:55,000
Hey.

421
00:29:56,041 --> 00:29:58,959
I think I saw you on the news.

422
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:00,291
What?

423
00:30:00,375 --> 00:30:03,000
It's for
the kids charity event, Dad.

424
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:04,166
- Alex.
- OK.

425
00:30:06,917 --> 00:30:10,333
Last year, I made page six

426
00:30:10,417 --> 00:30:13,542
when I took my boyfriend
Jan to Havana.

427
00:30:13,625 --> 00:30:15,458
We were worried.

428
00:30:15,542 --> 00:30:17,542
But it was all good
in the end, right?

429
00:30:17,625 --> 00:30:20,542
Yeah, you could say that.

430
00:30:22,083 --> 00:30:23,333
Let's go find Peggy.

431
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:24,375
Cool.

432
00:30:25,959 --> 00:30:28,625
So, your name is Bigger?

433
00:30:28,709 --> 00:30:30,583
Yeah, yeah.

434
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:32,333
My friends call me Big.

435
00:30:32,417 --> 00:30:34,000
Your hair is rad.

436
00:30:34,083 --> 00:30:36,125
Thanks.

437
00:30:36,208 --> 00:30:39,583
Do you ever go to, um, Animal?

438
00:30:39,667 --> 00:30:42,375
Yeah, yeah, sometimes.

439
00:30:42,458 --> 00:30:46,083
So crazy, all the political stuff
that's going on these days, right?

440
00:30:46,166 --> 00:30:48,291
Mary, I don't think Bigger

441
00:30:48,375 --> 00:30:49,667
wants to talk about...

442
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,291
Sure he does.

443
00:30:51,375 --> 00:30:54,125
Dad hates it when I talk
about Occupy

444
00:30:54,208 --> 00:30:55,750
or the Peoples Movement,

445
00:30:55,834 --> 00:30:58,917
but, I mean, you probably
march, right?

446
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,542
Well...

447
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,875
I hear you, I hear you.

448
00:31:01,959 --> 00:31:03,333
Folks work a nine-to-five job

449
00:31:03,417 --> 00:31:06,166
don't really have time
to be at all the rallies.

450
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:07,875
But you're outraged, aren't you?

451
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:10,208
Yeah.

452
00:31:10,291 --> 00:31:11,709
Sure.

453
00:31:12,875 --> 00:31:14,083
See, Dad?

454
00:31:14,166 --> 00:31:15,542
He's outraged.

455
00:31:15,625 --> 00:31:18,542
Unlike you because you're
a damn capitalist.

456
00:31:18,625 --> 00:31:22,542
You're outraged,
as you should be.

457
00:31:22,625 --> 00:31:25,709
I'm just happy to have this job.

458
00:31:25,792 --> 00:31:29,041
I have class tonight.

459
00:31:29,125 --> 00:31:30,458
You gonna take me?

460
00:31:30,542 --> 00:31:33,041
We haven't worked out
his start date yet.

461
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:35,500
Let him start tonight.

462
00:31:35,583 --> 00:31:38,792
Yeah, I can... I can...
I can start tonight.

463
00:31:38,875 --> 00:31:40,333
Is that cool?

464
00:31:40,417 --> 00:31:42,125
Yeah, that's... that's fine.

465
00:31:42,208 --> 00:31:43,542
Cool. OK.

466
00:31:43,625 --> 00:31:45,000
- Bye.
- Love you.

467
00:31:45,083 --> 00:31:46,166
- You too.
- See you.

468
00:31:46,250 --> 00:31:47,458
It's nice...

469
00:31:49,166 --> 00:31:53,333
For years, we have been staunch
supporters of the NAACP.

470
00:31:53,417 --> 00:31:56,375
Mary, instead of pointing
out the good I'm doing,

471
00:31:56,458 --> 00:31:59,500
delights in pointing out
my faults.

472
00:32:02,041 --> 00:32:04,625
Well, I think you're doing
a pretty good job, sir.

473
00:32:04,709 --> 00:32:06,792
I appreciate you saying that.

474
00:32:08,333 --> 00:32:10,208
This is your room.

475
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,000
OK.

476
00:32:14,083 --> 00:32:16,375
Look, you get southern exposure,

477
00:32:16,458 --> 00:32:19,750
so it will always be
nice and bright.

478
00:32:19,834 --> 00:32:21,417
We're changing the sheets
once a week.

479
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,667
- OK.
- And you've got Wi-Fi.

480
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:24,917
Great.

481
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,667
You and I will always use
these back stairs here

482
00:32:27,750 --> 00:32:31,208
so that they can have their privacy,
and, quite frankly, so can we.

483
00:32:31,291 --> 00:32:32,625
Cool.

484
00:32:32,709 --> 00:32:34,789
You know, after you've
been working here for a while,

485
00:32:34,834 --> 00:32:36,667
you might have a lady friend

486
00:32:36,750 --> 00:32:38,917
whom you'd like to invite
over sometime.

487
00:32:40,417 --> 00:32:42,792
I think a place like this
needs security cameras,

488
00:32:42,875 --> 00:32:44,709
but Mr. Dalton thinks

489
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:49,333
heightened security
means heightened crime.

490
00:32:49,417 --> 00:32:50,667
So, this is the furnace.

491
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:53,375
You'll be in charge
of loading this monster.

492
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:56,667
It heats the house adequately,
but it's a clunky old thing.

493
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,333
Still takes coal.

494
00:32:58,417 --> 00:33:01,625
I tell Mr. Dalton,
let's get something more green, but...

495
00:33:01,709 --> 00:33:04,208
maybe you'll be able
to convince him.

496
00:33:04,291 --> 00:33:08,166
Until then, you'll be
loading this dinosaur

497
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:09,667
twice a day,

498
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:11,959
and each night
before you go to bed,

499
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:14,750
you have to clean out the ashes.

500
00:33:16,542 --> 00:33:17,542
All clear?

501
00:33:17,625 --> 00:33:18,709
All right.

502
00:33:20,166 --> 00:33:21,709
Good.

503
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:34,625
Can I touch your hair?

504
00:33:36,709 --> 00:33:38,041
I'm kidding.

505
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:45,166
Wanna turn the radio on?

506
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:46,417
Sure.

507
00:33:48,291 --> 00:33:49,750
Shit.

508
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:08,250
You like this music?

509
00:34:09,834 --> 00:34:12,417
Yeah, it's... it's cool.

510
00:34:13,625 --> 00:34:15,709
What do you listen to?

511
00:34:15,792 --> 00:34:19,834
Well, if you
really want to know,

512
00:34:19,917 --> 00:34:23,041
sometimes...

513
00:34:23,125 --> 00:34:24,041
this.

514
00:34:28,083 --> 00:34:31,250
It's pretty cool.

515
00:34:31,333 --> 00:34:32,875
Then...

516
00:34:32,959 --> 00:34:35,917
sometimes I look for this.

517
00:34:39,125 --> 00:34:40,208
OK.

518
00:34:40,291 --> 00:34:42,458
It's all perspective.

519
00:34:43,458 --> 00:34:46,291
Well, rest assured,

520
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:49,792
you and my dad are gonna
get along just great.

521
00:35:09,834 --> 00:35:12,417
I thought you were
going to class?

522
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,208
Just meeting some friends.

523
00:35:14,291 --> 00:35:15,834
You wanna come in?

524
00:35:15,917 --> 00:35:18,625
Nah, I'm good. I think I should
probably stay with the car.

525
00:35:18,709 --> 00:35:20,458
No, you should come in,

526
00:35:20,542 --> 00:35:23,333
but, I get it.

527
00:35:23,417 --> 00:35:25,375
OK. Stay warm.

528
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:26,375
All right.

529
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:11,333
Bye.

530
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:13,250
See ya.

531
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,959
Big?

532
00:36:16,083 --> 00:36:17,250
Hey.

533
00:36:19,417 --> 00:36:20,417
You're Jan.

534
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:22,875
How'd you know?

535
00:36:22,959 --> 00:36:24,750
Stuff I read online.

536
00:36:26,041 --> 00:36:28,417
Don't believe everything
you read about Jan.

537
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,208
There's a lot of
fake news out there.

538
00:36:31,291 --> 00:36:33,125
Hey, can I drive?

539
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:35,208
Don't worry about
it, Big, it's cool.

540
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,417
Cool. Everybody in?

541
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,458
Where should we go?

542
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:48,750
I'm starving.
Are you hungry, Big?

543
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:52,083
I'm all right.

544
00:36:52,166 --> 00:36:54,959
Yo, how 'bout a place
in your neighborhood, Big?

545
00:36:56,208 --> 00:36:57,792
You know...

546
00:36:57,875 --> 00:37:00,125
where you can get
some real food.

547
00:37:01,166 --> 00:37:03,166
What about B and G's?

548
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:04,417
Let's go to B and G's, yeah?

549
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:06,333
Sounds good.

550
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:09,417
I don't... I don't think y'all
want to go to B and G's.

551
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:12,291
It's on Juneway Terrace
and Howard.

552
00:37:13,834 --> 00:37:15,583
Hey, maybe Big
doesn't want to go.

553
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:17,667
It'll be fun.

554
00:37:17,750 --> 00:37:20,458
Come on, guys,
it'll be my treat.

555
00:37:25,625 --> 00:37:27,375
All right, let's...

556
00:37:27,458 --> 00:37:29,417
let's go to B and G's.

557
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,291
All right.

558
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,000
Let's go.

559
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:56,500
Thank you.

560
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,000
Can we get a bottle of vodka?

561
00:38:05,625 --> 00:38:07,125
Thank you.

562
00:38:09,166 --> 00:38:11,417
Yo, why is Big with them?

563
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:12,417
I don't know.

564
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:14,291
He's supposed to be at work.

565
00:38:15,417 --> 00:38:17,375
It don't look like he at work.

566
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:20,834
This place is nice.

567
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:26,917
Hey, Big.

568
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,500
Hey, Lily.

569
00:38:31,291 --> 00:38:34,959
Look, I'm sure he ain't with her, a'ight?
He's with them.

570
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:38,667
If he's working,
then why is he sitting with them?

571
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,166
I don't know.

572
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:44,375
Bess.

573
00:38:44,458 --> 00:38:46,166
I'm-a be cool.

574
00:38:46,250 --> 00:38:47,375
A'ight.

575
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,500
Hey.

576
00:38:56,583 --> 00:38:58,750
I thought you was at work.

577
00:39:00,625 --> 00:39:01,792
I am.

578
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,375
I'm Jan.

579
00:39:07,458 --> 00:39:09,542
I'm Mary. Hi.

580
00:39:10,667 --> 00:39:12,250
Nice job.

581
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,750
Yeah, it's all right.

582
00:39:14,834 --> 00:39:17,959
I didn't catch your name.
Sorry, what's your name?

583
00:39:18,041 --> 00:39:19,583
This is Bessie.

584
00:39:19,667 --> 00:39:23,000
Bessie, if you want to sit
down, there's plenty of room.

585
00:39:23,083 --> 00:39:26,250
No. I'm already
sitting over there.

586
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,250
I'll go back to my place.

587
00:39:32,083 --> 00:39:34,875
Hey, you wanna...
You wanna meet up later?

588
00:39:48,041 --> 00:39:49,166
You want one?

589
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,750
Yeah, all right.

590
00:39:57,333 --> 00:39:59,583
That your girlfriend?

591
00:39:59,667 --> 00:40:01,125
Yep.

592
00:40:03,041 --> 00:40:05,959
Jan and I are engaged.

593
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:09,166
But please don't tell my dad

594
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,125
because he'll lose his mind.

595
00:40:12,709 --> 00:40:14,458
Your dad seems all right.

596
00:40:14,542 --> 00:40:16,375
Yeah...

597
00:40:16,458 --> 00:40:18,208
if you like One-Percenters.

598
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:20,959
It's all the same shit to me.

599
00:40:23,417 --> 00:40:25,166
I grew up in Los Angeles...

600
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:28,375
Well, outside of Los Angeles.

601
00:40:28,458 --> 00:40:30,750
My folks split up.

602
00:40:30,834 --> 00:40:33,834
Me and my mom, we...

603
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,000
scraped by.

604
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,709
My dad, he was
an accountant, you know?

605
00:40:57,125 --> 00:40:58,667
One day he just...

606
00:41:00,083 --> 00:41:02,875
dropped dead.

607
00:41:06,875 --> 00:41:08,667
So sorry.

608
00:41:12,709 --> 00:41:14,333
No, it's all good.

609
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:19,083
How long?

610
00:41:21,417 --> 00:41:24,875
'Bout six or seven years ago.

611
00:41:31,375 --> 00:41:35,083
I live in such
an "affluenza" bubble,

612
00:41:35,166 --> 00:41:36,166
and...

613
00:41:38,834 --> 00:41:40,542
I've no idea...

614
00:41:41,959 --> 00:41:45,291
about what, like,
black people actually think

615
00:41:45,375 --> 00:41:47,583
about what's going on
in the world right now.

616
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,375
Well, I'll be sure
to mention that

617
00:41:50,458 --> 00:41:53,667
at our next black meeting.

618
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,792
- Good night.
- Good night.

619
00:42:30,125 --> 00:42:32,083
Let me ask you a question.

620
00:42:34,625 --> 00:42:38,667
The driver before me, Greene,

621
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:42,083
he used to take you
wherever you wanted to go?

622
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,542
No, he was,

623
00:42:47,625 --> 00:42:50,125
straight as an arrow,
super square,

624
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:51,333
no fun ever.

625
00:42:54,667 --> 00:42:56,792
No, he was all right,
though. He...

626
00:42:58,041 --> 00:42:59,041
He went to night school,

627
00:42:59,125 --> 00:43:02,458
he got his degree in business.

628
00:43:04,375 --> 00:43:06,917
Moving on up.

629
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:09,000
My parents are
very proud of him.

630
00:43:42,083 --> 00:43:44,875
That's a lot of stairs.

631
00:43:50,208 --> 00:43:51,375
Help me.

632
00:43:55,041 --> 00:43:56,709
You can make it up.

633
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:42,750
Here's the thing, Mom...
I'm fine to go to church,

634
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:45,166
so long as you can
recognize that

635
00:44:45,250 --> 00:44:47,000
religion is the opiate
of the masses.

636
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,125
OK.

637
00:44:48,208 --> 00:44:50,583
I think it is lovely

638
00:44:50,667 --> 00:44:52,542
that we are attending church

639
00:44:52,625 --> 00:44:53,917
and giving thanks.

640
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:57,166
It is, it is, it's lovely.

641
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,792
Thank you. Thank you, Jesus.

642
00:45:56,333 --> 00:45:58,250
I could use a week of rain,

643
00:45:58,333 --> 00:46:00,750
just listening to you read.

644
00:46:00,834 --> 00:46:03,917
You're gonna read me
another chapter, aren't you?

645
00:46:07,834 --> 00:46:11,583
"I looked at him eagerly
when he looked at me,"

646
00:46:11,667 --> 00:46:17,000
and slightly moved my hands
and shook my head.

647
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:20,000
I had been waiting for him
to see me,

648
00:46:20,083 --> 00:46:24,709
that I might try to assure him
of my innocence.

649
00:46:26,041 --> 00:46:28,417
It was not at all
expressed to me

650
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:32,959
that he even comprehended
my intention,

651
00:46:33,041 --> 00:46:39,125
for he gave me a look
that I did not understand,

652
00:46:39,208 --> 00:46:41,542
and it all passed

653
00:46:41,625 --> 00:46:44,750
"in a moment."

654
00:46:47,166 --> 00:46:48,959
So fantastic.

655
00:47:38,125 --> 00:47:39,875
I love Beethoven.

656
00:47:39,959 --> 00:47:41,959
Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I love him too.

657
00:47:42,041 --> 00:47:43,750
All right.

658
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:50,333
So, you can borrow the
car anytime you like.

659
00:47:50,417 --> 00:47:51,583
Yeah?

660
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,333
Take your girl out for a spin,

661
00:47:53,417 --> 00:47:54,291
or something.

662
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,250
Yeah, maybe.

663
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:02,583
♪ Hey, wait, look, ♪

664
00:48:41,333 --> 00:48:43,792
Hey, babe, bring me water.

665
00:48:53,875 --> 00:48:55,875
I didn't do the job
because you didn't show.

666
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:01,000
Nigga, don't be casting
your fucking anxieties on me.

667
00:49:01,083 --> 00:49:03,333
Got yourself a new job
and you lost your nuts?

668
00:49:03,417 --> 00:49:05,542
Don't go there, big dawg.

669
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,041
I'll go wherever
the fuck I want.

670
00:49:07,125 --> 00:49:08,417
Better watch yourself.

671
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,875
Big'll put you
out on the street,

672
00:49:09,959 --> 00:49:11,625
your ass gon' be walkin' home.

673
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:16,583
Nigga ain't interested
in a real job.

674
00:49:16,667 --> 00:49:18,375
He's too busy working
for the white folk.

675
00:49:20,250 --> 00:49:21,208
Yeah.

676
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,583
You a house nigger now.

677
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:26,291
Hey, fuck you, nigga.

678
00:49:26,375 --> 00:49:28,125
No, fuck you.

679
00:49:28,208 --> 00:49:29,875
Living in a big house.

680
00:49:31,709 --> 00:49:34,083
You aren't a nigga no more,
are you... nigga?

681
00:49:36,208 --> 00:49:38,125
He never even really was one.

682
00:49:38,208 --> 00:49:41,583
Yeah, you a lame-ass
pussy Oreo for damn sure.

683
00:50:12,083 --> 00:50:13,041
Fuck!

684
00:50:13,125 --> 00:50:14,000
Yo, Big, come on!

685
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:15,667
Come on, Big, get off him!

686
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,834
What the fuck, man?

687
00:50:16,917 --> 00:50:18,417
No, no, no, no, no!

688
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,000
Black enough for your
motherfuckin' ' ass now, nigga?

689
00:50:21,083 --> 00:50:22,166
Chill, chill.

690
00:50:22,250 --> 00:50:25,083
- Man, fuck you, Big!
- No, no, no, no, no.

691
00:50:25,166 --> 00:50:27,750
You hit me? Get the fuck off me!

692
00:50:27,834 --> 00:50:30,625
Look at me, baby,
look at me, look at me.

693
00:50:30,709 --> 00:50:31,583
Hey.

694
00:50:33,291 --> 00:50:34,250
Hey.

695
00:50:37,458 --> 00:50:38,417
Hey.

696
00:51:06,291 --> 00:51:07,291
'Sup?

697
00:51:10,917 --> 00:51:12,583
Can I help you with something?

698
00:51:12,667 --> 00:51:15,041
My name is Greene.

699
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:17,000
You must be Bigger.

700
00:51:17,083 --> 00:51:18,000
Yeah.

701
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:27,250
So, what, you here to
take your old job back?

702
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:31,750
No, young man,
I'm happy where I'm at.

703
00:51:31,834 --> 00:51:35,000
Mr. Dalton says
you workin' out all right.

704
00:51:36,166 --> 00:51:37,166
I am.

705
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:39,583
Still got both your
feet on the ground?

706
00:51:39,667 --> 00:51:42,375
Shit, you see me standing here?

707
00:51:42,458 --> 00:51:44,834
Good man. Keep standing.

708
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:47,458
You know,

709
00:51:47,542 --> 00:51:50,750
you and me came up
in the same hood.

710
00:51:50,834 --> 00:51:54,166
I'm guessing that you had your
share of troubles like I had.

711
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:55,834
You don't know...

712
00:51:55,917 --> 00:51:57,667
nothing about me, man.

713
00:52:04,750 --> 00:52:07,125
Just, you know...

714
00:52:07,208 --> 00:52:09,542
try to keep both feet
on the good foot.

715
00:52:12,542 --> 00:52:14,542
What is that supposed to mean?

716
00:52:16,458 --> 00:52:18,500
I know you don't
know me from Adam,

717
00:52:18,583 --> 00:52:21,792
but I'm just here to give you
some friendly advice.

718
00:52:23,250 --> 00:52:26,959
Mr. Dalton's
giving you a chance.

719
00:52:27,041 --> 00:52:29,208
Make something of it, OK?

720
00:52:47,166 --> 00:52:49,000
Aren't you cold?

721
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:51,250
A little.

722
00:52:58,125 --> 00:53:00,750
I don't know about Mary, man.

723
00:53:00,834 --> 00:53:02,458
She seem a little crazy.

724
00:53:05,208 --> 00:53:06,583
Probably.

725
00:53:17,417 --> 00:53:19,125
What? What? Really?

726
00:53:19,208 --> 00:53:20,542
Yeah.

727
00:53:20,625 --> 00:53:22,041
Come on, get up.

728
00:53:23,250 --> 00:53:24,667
Get up, baby.

729
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:28,333
- What?
- Come on.

730
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,542
What you trying to do?

731
00:53:31,834 --> 00:53:32,834
Why you playing?

732
00:53:32,917 --> 00:53:35,375
Girl...

733
00:53:35,458 --> 00:53:38,959
Your friend have anything
more interesting than weed?

734
00:53:39,041 --> 00:53:40,458
You know, like...

735
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,959
I don't know,
something stronger?

736
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:48,291
So you're studying
business management?

737
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:52,250
That's not boring. It's smart.

738
00:53:52,333 --> 00:53:54,291
Yeah, it feels boring.

739
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:57,417
Well...

740
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,417
it's totally marketable,
which is great.

741
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:06,709
Beethoven?

742
00:54:06,792 --> 00:54:08,208
Ninth Symphony?

743
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:10,500
Yeah, that's a good one.

744
00:54:10,583 --> 00:54:12,625
Well, you should come.

745
00:54:18,208 --> 00:54:19,709
What, you gon' go?

746
00:54:19,792 --> 00:54:21,709
My parents are
season subscribers,

747
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:23,583
so they always get
two pairs of tickets,

748
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:25,083
but they never use 'em.

749
00:54:25,166 --> 00:54:27,046
They'd love it, really.
I mean, we-we should go.

750
00:54:27,071 --> 00:54:27,917
See you, Jules.

751
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:30,041
I got exams this week.

752
00:54:30,125 --> 00:54:31,792
All right.

753
00:54:31,875 --> 00:54:33,750
Well, you think about it.

754
00:54:33,834 --> 00:54:35,625
I will.

755
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:42,667
So, where do you spend
your summer, Big?

756
00:54:43,667 --> 00:54:47,333
I summer where I winter.

757
00:54:50,542 --> 00:54:52,709
Not everybody goes away
for the summer, babe.

758
00:54:54,875 --> 00:54:56,041
I didn't want to assume.

759
00:54:57,583 --> 00:54:59,250
I mean, that's worse, right?

760
00:55:02,125 --> 00:55:04,041
Sorry.

761
00:55:04,125 --> 00:55:06,166
You'll get used to us.

762
00:55:12,750 --> 00:55:14,208
I should probably...

763
00:55:24,709 --> 00:55:26,166
Good evening, Miss Dalton.

764
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,375
Hi, George. Sorry we're late.

765
00:55:46,083 --> 00:55:48,333
Beethoven's Ninth Symphony.

766
00:55:48,417 --> 00:55:50,458
A blockbuster.

767
00:55:50,542 --> 00:55:53,625
A true fucking masterpiece.

768
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:58,917
"I don't want to know anything
about your system of ethics."

769
00:56:00,709 --> 00:56:02,166
Strength is the morality

770
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:04,959
of the man who
stands out from the rest...

771
00:56:07,792 --> 00:56:09,417
"and it is mine."

772
00:57:04,083 --> 00:57:05,542
"with love."

773
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:11,834
Why do they call it Molly?

774
00:57:15,291 --> 00:57:17,458
Enjoy yourselves.

775
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:28,583
It's going to come from you.

776
00:57:28,667 --> 00:57:32,417
That's how it has to happen,
if it happens at all.

777
00:57:32,500 --> 00:57:35,834
But if it does happen, it's
going to come from you, right?

778
00:57:35,917 --> 00:57:37,583
Like, you have the power.

779
00:57:37,667 --> 00:57:39,750
You guys have the crux.

780
00:57:39,834 --> 00:57:43,959
Our generation has
the power to change things.

781
00:58:09,375 --> 00:58:11,166
I should go.

782
00:58:13,291 --> 00:58:15,333
I got work in the morning.

783
00:58:17,959 --> 00:58:19,709
Damn, though.

784
00:58:21,875 --> 00:58:24,125
Damn, you know I can't wait.

785
00:58:27,792 --> 00:58:28,750
I know.

786
00:58:30,917 --> 00:58:32,750
I'll text you when I get home.

787
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:42,125
I love you.

788
00:58:42,208 --> 00:58:43,583
I love you.

789
00:58:47,959 --> 00:58:49,583
I love you too.

790
00:59:23,959 --> 00:59:26,000
What the fuck!-

791
00:59:26,083 --> 00:59:28,041
It's OK, it's OK,
it's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

792
00:59:28,125 --> 00:59:29,125
What do you mean it's OK?

793
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:31,041
No, get the fuck off!

794
00:59:31,125 --> 00:59:32,458
Jesus!

795
00:59:34,000 --> 00:59:35,875
Are you OK?

796
00:59:35,959 --> 00:59:37,250
Look, I'm sorry.

797
00:59:37,333 --> 00:59:39,458
Are you fucking kidding me?

798
00:59:41,834 --> 00:59:45,750
You know what? Fuck this!

799
00:59:45,834 --> 00:59:48,000
Big, can you get her home?

800
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:11,000
Thank you for the "E."

801
01:00:12,041 --> 01:00:13,083
It was an ounce.

802
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:15,500
Please just take it.

803
01:00:16,583 --> 01:00:17,500
Please?

804
01:00:18,834 --> 01:00:20,291
Thank you.

805
01:00:23,709 --> 01:00:27,667
Yeah, well, thank you
for the record.

806
01:00:29,667 --> 01:00:31,375
That shit was rad.

807
01:00:34,417 --> 01:00:37,291
Thank you for coming
to my rescue at the party.

808
01:00:37,375 --> 01:00:38,542
No sweat.

809
01:00:38,625 --> 01:00:40,333
Meant a lot to me.

810
01:00:52,375 --> 01:00:54,000
Oh, God.

811
01:01:03,291 --> 01:01:04,500
I feel weird.

812
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:08,291
You want me to pull over?

813
01:01:13,625 --> 01:01:15,083
I sorry.

814
01:01:15,166 --> 01:01:18,083
- All right.
- For something weird.

815
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,041
Fuck.

816
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:58,875

Hey, hey... Come on!

01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:12,625
Hey, come on!

821
01:02:19,709 --> 01:02:22,083
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, of course.

822
01:02:22,166 --> 01:02:24,375
But you gotta be
really quiet, OK?

823
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:25,583
Yeah.

824
01:02:35,667 --> 01:02:37,333
OK.

825
01:02:39,875 --> 01:02:43,083

826
01:02:43,166 --> 01:02:45,083
All right. You good?

827
01:02:45,166 --> 01:02:46,291
Yep.

828
01:02:46,375 --> 01:02:48,959
All right,
but you gotta be quiet.

829
01:02:49,041 --> 01:02:51,333
- OK?
- You

830
01:02:55,583 --> 01:02:58,917
Yeah...

831
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,375
- OK. All right.
- Hey!

832
01:03:01,458 --> 01:03:07,291
- Hey.
- I love... everything.

833
01:03:07,375 --> 01:03:11,041
- That's the point, OK?
- Hey.

834
01:03:11,125 --> 01:03:14,959
- OK. I need you to have a seat.
- No.

835
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,458
I love you.

836
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:20,166
- Right.
- No! Hey.

837
01:03:20,250 --> 01:03:21,917
I mean it. I really love you.

838
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:24,959
OK. All right.
I think you're really, really high.

839
01:03:25,041 --> 01:03:27,500
- Hey.
- You gotta lay down for me.

840
01:03:27,583 --> 01:03:30,542
- All right?
- Thank you for the great drugs.

841
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:33,167
OK.

842
01:03:37,375 --> 01:03:39,583
Hey. You gotta stop.

843
01:03:39,667 --> 01:03:41,834
You're gonna
get me fired, all right?

844
01:03:46,875 --> 01:03:49,250
- OK, now you gotta lay...
- Do you wanna have a thing?

845
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:53,917
- We could have a little thing.
- No.

846
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:55,291
We could have a big thing.

847
01:03:55,375 --> 01:03:57,375
No, no, no. Don't.

848
01:03:59,041 --> 01:04:02,125
Lay down for me, all right?

849
01:04:02,208 --> 01:04:05,291
- OK? I don't wanna get fired.
- OK, OK, OK, OK.

850
01:04:05,375 --> 01:04:06,583
You're gonna get me fired.

851
01:04:06,667 --> 01:04:09,125
If I lay down for you,

852
01:04:09,208 --> 01:04:11,000
will you lay down with me?

853
01:04:11,083 --> 01:04:12,709
You gonna make me lose my job.

854
01:04:12,792 --> 01:04:15,834
- You're very handsome.
- Stop it.

855
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:18,000
You're so handsome.

856
01:04:18,083 --> 01:04:21,583
- I mean it.
- You're really handsome.

857
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:23,500
Mary?

858
01:04:23,583 --> 01:04:28,417
I don't want you to...

859
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:32,125
- I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.
- All right, all right.

860
01:04:32,208 --> 01:04:33,834
Mary, are you here?

861
01:04:33,917 --> 01:04:36,083
That's my mom.

862
01:04:36,166 --> 01:04:37,917
Are you home?

863
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,333
Mom?

864
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:47,583
Mary, are you there?

865
01:05:03,750 --> 01:05:04,834
What's that, dear?

866
01:05:35,917 --> 01:05:37,709
Mary?

867
01:06:04,125 --> 01:06:09,375
Hey. Hey, hey!

868
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:13,333
Hey! Mary stop playing! Come on!

869
01:06:16,917 --> 01:06:18,417
Let's go!

870
01:07:44,625 --> 01:07:47,333
They'll open their bedroom
doors, and they'll catch me.

871
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:53,333
I hope they do.

872
01:07:54,625 --> 01:07:57,291
Then it'll be over.

873
01:07:57,375 --> 01:08:02,083
Then it'll be done,
and I'll be able to rest.

874
01:08:04,417 --> 01:08:09,291
But no, they're not going
to open their doors, are they?

875
01:08:10,667 --> 01:08:11,917
They're not going to see me

876
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:13,959
carrying her
through their house.

877
01:08:15,750 --> 01:08:18,583
'Cause they're blind.

878
01:08:18,667 --> 01:08:22,667
Her. Both of them.

879
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:25,000
All of them.

880
01:08:25,083 --> 01:08:26,500
They're blind.

881
01:09:42,417 --> 01:09:44,208
You're gonna help me out, OK?

882
01:09:46,917 --> 01:09:48,083
Help me out.

883
01:10:43,917 --> 01:10:45,792
Come on. Help me out.

884
01:10:51,750 --> 01:10:56,208
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

885
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:21,834
OK.

886
01:13:15,834 --> 01:13:16,959
Big.

887
01:13:20,667 --> 01:13:21,917
Big.

888
01:13:25,875 --> 01:13:26,792
Big.

889
01:13:28,166 --> 01:13:29,333
What's up?

890
01:13:29,417 --> 01:13:31,166
You ain't like it
at their house?

891
01:13:34,208 --> 01:13:36,166
Learn how to speak

892
01:13:37,792 --> 01:13:41,041
Must've fell out your pocket
when you was sleepin'.

893
01:13:41,125 --> 01:13:42,917
Anybody else see you with this?

894
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:43,959
No.

895
01:13:47,709 --> 01:13:50,041
Don't tell nobody, all right?

896
01:13:50,125 --> 01:13:52,417
You need my help?

897
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,583
No, just don't tell nobody.

898
01:13:54,667 --> 01:13:56,208
OK.

899
01:14:02,667 --> 01:14:05,625
- Hey, baby.
- Hey, Mom.

900
01:14:05,709 --> 01:14:07,375
I thought I heard you come in.

901
01:14:11,125 --> 01:14:13,750
How are things goin'?

902
01:14:13,834 --> 01:14:17,208
- Good.
- Good?

903
01:14:17,291 --> 01:14:18,333
Yeah.

904
01:14:18,417 --> 01:14:21,750
You know, your father and I...

905
01:14:21,834 --> 01:14:24,792
we used to always talk
about how you shine.

906
01:14:27,875 --> 01:14:33,000
You're a very special boy,
Bigger, and you've always

907
01:14:33,083 --> 01:14:35,291
done things your own way.

908
01:14:35,375 --> 01:14:37,792
And I know, because of that,

909
01:14:37,875 --> 01:14:40,542
things haven't always
been easy for you.

910
01:14:43,041 --> 01:14:45,625
And this job may
not be your dream job,

911
01:14:45,709 --> 01:14:51,792
but I am so proud of you for
taking on the responsibility.

912
01:14:51,875 --> 01:14:53,875
And I know your dad
would be, too.

913
01:15:07,041 --> 01:15:11,375
Good, bread, good meat...
Good Lord, let's eat.

914
01:15:11,458 --> 01:15:12,375
Amen.

915
01:15:14,125 --> 01:15:15,417
- Amen.
- Amen.

916
01:15:16,834 --> 01:15:18,458
I'm sitting with them,

917
01:15:18,542 --> 01:15:21,500
and they don't even
know what I've done.

918
01:15:21,583 --> 01:15:24,208
Don't use your fingers.

919
01:15:24,291 --> 01:15:28,750
Even if it wasn't me,
folks would assume it was.

920
01:15:28,834 --> 01:15:30,458
- Hey, Mom.
- Yeah?

921
01:15:30,542 --> 01:15:34,166
So I won't make it me.

922
01:15:34,250 --> 01:15:36,959
I won't make it anybody.

923
01:15:39,667 --> 01:15:44,291
I gotta find a way
to be OK somehow.

924
01:15:44,375 --> 01:15:47,792
Find a way to be
something other than...

925
01:15:47,875 --> 01:15:53,875
something other than what I am.

926
01:16:10,458 --> 01:16:12,875
Is Mary coming down?

927
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:15,583
I don't think
she came home last night.

928
01:16:15,667 --> 01:16:17,250
Her bed wasn't slept in.

929
01:16:17,333 --> 01:16:18,417
No?

930
01:16:18,500 --> 01:16:20,583
I'll go give her a call.

931
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:51,333
Is Mary ready to go?

932
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:57,250
Peggy said she
didn't come home last night,

933
01:16:57,333 --> 01:16:59,625
though I thought I heard her.

934
01:16:59,709 --> 01:17:03,792
She came home. I brought her.

935
01:17:11,208 --> 01:17:13,667
Chicago's mayor's office
today announced a plan

936
01:17:13,750 --> 01:17:18,458
to add affordable housing to the city's most
expensive and gentrifying neighborhoods.

937
01:17:18,542 --> 01:17:20,625
Our own George Sherman explains.

938
01:17:20,709 --> 01:17:23,542
The mayor wants to create
a multimillion-dollar fund

939
01:17:23,625 --> 01:17:25,792
to give low-cost loans
to developers.

940
01:17:25,875 --> 01:17:27,625
The loans then
would be used for...

941
01:17:27,709 --> 01:17:30,959
If I prove myself, they'll
put me on the management track,

942
01:17:31,041 --> 01:17:32,792
which means I'll be in
charge of the ushers

943
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:34,500
and the concession services.

944
01:17:34,583 --> 01:17:38,291
And I get a say in what kind
of products we stock.

945
01:17:38,375 --> 01:17:40,500
You know, some candies
just sell better than others.

946
01:17:40,583 --> 01:17:42,083
Is Tony blind, too?

947
01:17:42,166 --> 01:17:44,041
The more candy you sell,

948
01:17:44,125 --> 01:17:45,625
the bigger your profit margin.

949
01:17:45,709 --> 01:17:49,291
Shit, man, I'll be managing
that movie theater one day.

950
01:17:49,375 --> 01:17:51,792
- You know, God willing.
- Shit.

951
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:54,917
- Yo.
- Is Gus blind?

952
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,750
What's good, baby?

953
01:17:56,834 --> 01:17:59,834
- What's good?
- Probably.

954
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:08,500
The only thing worse than
being blind is having sight...

955
01:18:08,583 --> 01:18:10,041
but no vision.

956
01:18:12,583 --> 01:18:14,417
Maybe everybody's blind.

957
01:18:16,041 --> 01:18:18,959
Even me.

958
01:18:46,834 --> 01:18:48,959
We checked all
the public transportation.

959
01:18:49,041 --> 01:18:51,792
The rental cars,
the car service...

960
01:18:51,875 --> 01:18:53,709
So she hasn't
gone to Cuba this time.

961
01:18:53,792 --> 01:18:55,166
Doesn't seem like it, sir.

962
01:18:55,250 --> 01:18:58,542
How long you been
workin' here, son?

963
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,000
A little over a month.

964
01:19:00,083 --> 01:19:02,041
You and Mary like to hang out?

965
01:19:02,125 --> 01:19:05,667
- No...
- You're pals on social media.

966
01:19:05,750 --> 01:19:07,291
Yeah, well, that's just...

967
01:19:07,375 --> 01:19:10,125
How about you come downtown
and answer a few questions?

968
01:19:10,208 --> 01:19:12,166
You're charging
Bigger with a crime?

969
01:19:12,250 --> 01:19:13,250
Not at all.

970
01:19:13,333 --> 01:19:14,458
Then I don't see any reason

971
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:15,709
why you need to drag him

972
01:19:15,792 --> 01:19:17,333
downtown for questioning.

973
01:19:20,667 --> 01:19:25,500
No CCTV, so for now
we're believing your story.

974
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:26,917
So you brought 'em here?

975
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:28,417
Mary and Jan. Then what?

976
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:34,417
Yeah. You know,
Jan's her boyfriend, I guess.

977
01:19:34,500 --> 01:19:36,083
Why do you guess?

978
01:19:36,166 --> 01:19:39,500
It's her boyfriend for sure.

979
01:19:39,583 --> 01:19:42,291
And they were drinking.

980
01:19:42,375 --> 01:19:43,667
You know, Jan's got a flask

981
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:46,333
that he's on familiar terms with

982
01:19:46,417 --> 01:19:48,917
if y'all get what I'm saying?

983
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:58,542
They went to this party
on the Gold Coast.

984
01:19:58,625 --> 01:20:01,500
One of Mary's college friends.

985
01:20:01,583 --> 01:20:03,625
What kind of party was it?

986
01:20:03,709 --> 01:20:06,458
Well, I went inside.

987
01:20:06,542 --> 01:20:08,208
You know,
it was so cold outside,

988
01:20:08,291 --> 01:20:10,917
and I could only keep the car
running for so long, so...

989
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:14,792
I went inside.
It was pretty lively in there.

990
01:20:14,875 --> 01:20:18,709
You must've had you a time.

991
01:20:18,792 --> 01:20:21,000
Nah, I just stayed by the door.

992
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,917
But Mary and Jan went in.

993
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:28,417
Yeah, They was having fun.

994
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:32,291
You know, smoking
and drinking and...

995
01:20:32,375 --> 01:20:35,041
you know,
probably doin' other stuff.

996
01:20:36,709 --> 01:20:37,667
Jan?

997
01:20:40,458 --> 01:20:41,959
Yeah.

998
01:20:42,041 --> 01:20:44,834
We've been watchin' him
ever since you asked us to.

999
01:20:44,917 --> 01:20:47,625
He's associated with
political groups in Berkeley,

1000
01:20:47,709 --> 01:20:50,667
but hasn't done much here
except run his mouth.

1001
01:20:50,750 --> 01:20:53,333
He's a big-time talker.

1002
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:54,709
Politics.

1003
01:20:54,792 --> 01:20:56,834
He tried to get you
to join his club

1004
01:20:56,917 --> 01:20:59,709
or whatever he calls it?

1005
01:20:59,792 --> 01:21:00,834
I don't got nothing to do

1006
01:21:00,917 --> 01:21:03,041
with that fucking shit.

1007
01:21:03,125 --> 01:21:04,667
I mean... excuse my language,

1008
01:21:04,750 --> 01:21:07,709
but politics
just ain't my thing.

1009
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:13,959
Besides, I got
a job anyway, so...

1010
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:22,375
Well, thanks for allowing
us to talk with you.

1011
01:21:22,458 --> 01:21:26,959
There. Asking me questions.

1012
01:21:27,041 --> 01:21:29,667
But they're taking
their cues from Mr. Dalton.

1013
01:21:31,917 --> 01:21:35,583
Me acting a good negro
is foolin' 'em.

1014
01:21:35,667 --> 01:21:41,500
Even though it's the same act
that they practice every day.

1015
01:21:41,583 --> 01:21:44,333
Sporting their badges,

1016
01:21:44,417 --> 01:21:46,959
but still got
the slave mentality.

1017
01:21:55,750 --> 01:21:57,625
- Just tell us where the hell she is.
- Look...

1018
01:21:57,709 --> 01:21:59,041
I went home that night!

1019
01:21:59,125 --> 01:22:00,875
After you took her out
for a good time.

1020
01:22:00,959 --> 01:22:04,959
No, I went home by myself.

1021
01:22:05,041 --> 01:22:07,750
Look, I didn't go anywhere
near her fucking house, OK?

1022
01:22:07,834 --> 01:22:10,208
You wanna stick it
to her dad, don't you?

1023
01:22:10,291 --> 01:22:14,417
No, I... I want a lawyer.

1024
01:22:14,500 --> 01:22:17,375
What did you do to her, Jan!

1025
01:22:17,458 --> 01:22:20,083
You know,

1026
01:22:20,166 --> 01:22:23,041
which part of protect
and serve is this?

1027
01:22:44,542 --> 01:22:46,333
Oh, my God!

1028
01:22:48,667 --> 01:22:51,834
It is a peculiar sensation,

1029
01:22:51,917 --> 01:22:56,458
this double consciousness.

1030
01:22:56,542 --> 01:23:01,625
This sense of always
looking at oneself

1031
01:23:01,709 --> 01:23:04,417
through the eyes of others...

1032
01:23:04,500 --> 01:23:07,542
of measure one's soul
by the tape of a world

1033
01:23:07,625 --> 01:23:12,083
that looks on
in amused contempt and pity.

1034
01:23:38,417 --> 01:23:39,333
Hey.

1035
01:23:39,417 --> 01:23:41,583
Hey, yourself.

1036
01:23:43,208 --> 01:23:45,041
How'd you get in?

1037
01:23:45,125 --> 01:23:47,458
The same way I always do.

1038
01:23:52,083 --> 01:23:53,750
What, is that a problem?

1039
01:23:53,834 --> 01:23:56,166
No, it's just that,

1040
01:23:56,250 --> 01:23:58,750
the movie doesn't start
for another hour or so.

1041
01:24:01,208 --> 01:24:02,583
Yeah.

1042
01:24:04,709 --> 01:24:08,792
Yeah... I'ma just wait it out.

1043
01:24:12,250 --> 01:24:15,041
You want some popcorn
or somethin'?

1044
01:24:15,125 --> 01:24:19,458
- No, I'm good.
- No, Big, I'll get you some popcorn. No sweat.

1045
01:25:10,166 --> 01:25:13,083
I didn't think you'd come.

1046
01:25:13,166 --> 01:25:15,792
You got the cops around
the corner or somethin'?

1047
01:25:18,125 --> 01:25:20,208
You know I'm not like that,

1048
01:25:23,041 --> 01:25:24,875
What happened to your face?

1049
01:25:27,208 --> 01:25:28,792
What do you think?

1050
01:25:37,792 --> 01:25:39,709
I know you're innocent.

1051
01:25:41,041 --> 01:25:44,583
Whatever happened out there,
it was...

1052
01:25:44,667 --> 01:25:46,208
I mean,
it was some kind of accident.

1053
01:25:46,291 --> 01:25:50,250
Sure, they're tryin' to say
that...

1054
01:25:50,333 --> 01:25:52,917
I raped her
'cause her body's burned.

1055
01:25:56,417 --> 01:25:58,667
Mary was...

1056
01:26:04,291 --> 01:26:06,500
I didn't...

1057
01:26:08,375 --> 01:26:11,583
you know, rape her or...

1058
01:26:13,792 --> 01:26:15,458
get with her...

1059
01:26:15,542 --> 01:26:18,083
or any of that.

1060
01:26:23,083 --> 01:26:25,250
I know a good lawyer.

1061
01:26:27,917 --> 01:26:29,917
- He'll help you.
- It's...

1062
01:26:30,000 --> 01:26:31,792
It's too late for that.

1063
01:26:31,875 --> 01:26:34,625
And the Daltons, man,
they'll be on your side

1064
01:26:34,709 --> 01:26:37,750
- if you just turn yourself in.
- It's too late for that!

1065
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:56,917
I thought we were friends.

1066
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:25,375
Let us pray

1067
01:27:25,458 --> 01:27:27,291
for the woman lost, Mary Dalton.

1068
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:29,000
And let us pray

1069
01:27:29,083 --> 01:27:31,375
for our brother Bigger Thomas.

1070
01:27:31,458 --> 01:27:34,208
And why do they say he's guilty?

1071
01:27:34,291 --> 01:27:35,875
Because in their minds,

1072
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:38,750
he was guilty
before he was born.

1073
01:27:38,834 --> 01:27:42,375
He's got black guilt.

1074
01:27:42,458 --> 01:27:46,083
There ain't nobody in this city
free of this scourge.

1075
01:27:46,166 --> 01:27:48,750
Some of us got black guilt.

1076
01:27:48,834 --> 01:27:52,250
Some of us got white guilt.

1077
01:27:52,333 --> 01:27:55,959
Two sides of the same
godforsaken...

1078
01:27:56,041 --> 01:27:59,875
two sides of
the same shameful story.

1079
01:28:12,583 --> 01:28:15,542
I'm not hungry.

1080
01:28:27,291 --> 01:28:28,959
You're gonna
turn yourself in, right?

1081
01:28:29,041 --> 01:28:30,792
For what?

1082
01:28:30,875 --> 01:28:33,709
- I didn't do nothin'.
- Then tell 'em that.

1083
01:28:33,792 --> 01:28:37,000
You can't stay back here
forever.

1084
01:28:45,250 --> 01:28:48,959
Yesterday when they came around
askin' about you,

1085
01:28:49,041 --> 01:28:50,625
I didn't tell 'em nothin'.

1086
01:28:50,709 --> 01:28:52,667
That's good.

1087
01:28:53,709 --> 01:28:55,208
That's good.

1088
01:29:00,709 --> 01:29:02,333
You shoulda let me cut it.

1089
01:29:02,417 --> 01:29:03,875
I'm all right.

1090
01:29:07,250 --> 01:29:11,291
You know, you're always talkin'
about wantin' to get married.

1091
01:29:12,583 --> 01:29:14,250
Well, let's do that.

1092
01:29:14,333 --> 01:29:16,250
Let's just run away
and get married.

1093
01:29:19,208 --> 01:29:21,208
Did you kill her?

1094
01:29:28,083 --> 01:29:30,000
You killed her.

1095
01:29:30,083 --> 01:29:32,083
No.

1096
01:29:32,166 --> 01:29:33,667
I didn't.

1097
01:29:33,750 --> 01:29:36,041
But if they catch me,

1098
01:29:36,125 --> 01:29:37,625
they'll pin it on me

1099
01:29:37,709 --> 01:29:40,166
and they'll twist it up
and make it seem like I did it.

1100
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:42,917
- You want that for me?
- So you gotta tell 'em that you didn't.

1101
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:45,375
- Tell Mr. Dalton.
- Mr. Dalton...

1102
01:29:45,458 --> 01:29:46,792
doesn't want to hear from me.

1103
01:29:49,041 --> 01:29:50,792
I don't know what
happened to her.

1104
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:54,834
But what I...

1105
01:29:54,917 --> 01:29:56,625
what I do know...

1106
01:29:58,375 --> 01:30:00,125
is that I need you.

1107
01:30:00,208 --> 01:30:02,041
You're not makin' any sense.

1108
01:30:02,125 --> 01:30:03,417
Run away with me.

1109
01:30:11,917 --> 01:30:13,625
They'll catch us.

1110
01:30:14,959 --> 01:30:16,959
Not if we're smart.

1111
01:30:19,542 --> 01:30:22,208
Not if we lay low.

1112
01:30:22,291 --> 01:30:24,125
Yeah?

1113
01:30:24,208 --> 01:30:25,959
We lay low and...

1114
01:30:28,000 --> 01:30:29,667
we hide out...

1115
01:30:31,166 --> 01:30:34,625
you know, we just wait
until things blow over.

1116
01:30:37,834 --> 01:30:39,458
Then we just go.

1117
01:30:45,166 --> 01:30:46,667
All right?

1118
01:30:48,333 --> 01:30:49,917
Yeah, OK.

1119
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:51,208
OK.

1120
01:30:53,834 --> 01:30:55,792
Now get your coat.

1121
01:30:57,792 --> 01:30:59,208
Go on.

1122
01:31:02,291 --> 01:31:04,333
Baby, get your coat.

1123
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:35,291
Hey. Hey.

1124
01:31:35,375 --> 01:31:37,250
Put your coat on.

1125
01:31:37,333 --> 01:31:38,875
You'll catch cold.

1126
01:31:51,083 --> 01:31:52,583
You got it.

1127
01:31:54,208 --> 01:31:55,917
I found a spot.

1128
01:31:57,250 --> 01:31:59,542
Where?

1129
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:01,667
It's a good spot.

1130
01:32:01,750 --> 01:32:05,375
OK?

1131
01:32:05,458 --> 01:32:07,875
Please don't do this to me, Big.

1132
01:32:09,625 --> 01:32:11,917
I done everything for you
I know how,

1133
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:14,208
but please don't do this to me.

1134
01:32:14,291 --> 01:32:18,000
I don't bother nobody.
I just go to work and I go to school...

1135
01:32:18,083 --> 01:32:22,041
- Hey. Hey.
- Please don't do this to me.

1136
01:32:22,125 --> 01:32:24,250
Hey. Hey. Hey.

1137
01:32:24,333 --> 01:32:26,125
Baby, I love you.

1138
01:32:26,208 --> 01:32:29,208
I love you. You gotta trust me.

1139
01:32:29,291 --> 01:32:31,583
OK? Hey.

1140
01:32:31,667 --> 01:32:32,625
Hey.

1141
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:34,792
You gotta trust me, OK?

1142
01:32:40,625 --> 01:32:42,125
OK?

1143
01:32:42,208 --> 01:32:43,500
You trust me?

1144
01:32:48,250 --> 01:32:49,458
OK.

1145
01:33:12,291 --> 01:33:14,041
This is a good spot.

1146
01:33:34,583 --> 01:33:35,959
Big.

1147
01:33:38,166 --> 01:33:40,625
If you ain't do nothin' wrong...

1148
01:33:40,709 --> 01:33:42,583
Hey. Hey.

1149
01:33:42,667 --> 01:33:44,667
I got this.

1150
01:33:46,000 --> 01:33:47,709
I got this.

1151
01:34:17,542 --> 01:34:18,875
Hey.

1152
01:34:23,542 --> 01:34:25,375
You sleep all right?

1153
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:34,792
I'm not...

1154
01:34:52,333 --> 01:34:54,542
I don't want to.

1155
01:34:55,875 --> 01:34:58,917
I can't be with you
right now. I...

1156
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,458
I came this far,
and that's all I can do.

1157
01:35:01,542 --> 01:35:03,333
Baby, you ain't even gotta do...

1158
01:35:03,417 --> 01:35:05,250
No.

1159
01:35:05,333 --> 01:35:08,375
Stop.

1160
01:35:08,458 --> 01:35:10,834
Stop. Stop it!

1161
01:35:10,917 --> 01:35:12,458
Stop!!!

1162
01:35:12,542 --> 01:35:14,917
Bessie!

1163
01:35:15,041 --> 01:35:17,542
Bessie. Bessie!

1164
01:35:17,625 --> 01:35:19,625
Did you kill her?

1165
01:35:23,792 --> 01:35:25,291
I...

1166
01:35:39,875 --> 01:35:40,959
Gimme that.

1167
01:35:42,583 --> 01:35:44,458
Come on, give me the gun.

1168
01:35:45,625 --> 01:35:47,458
No.

1169
01:36:13,792 --> 01:36:15,500
Why you gotta do that?

1170
01:36:15,583 --> 01:36:19,750
You gotta turn yourself in, Big.

1171
01:36:25,125 --> 01:36:27,834
- What you do that for?
- Big.

1172
01:36:29,834 --> 01:36:32,709
- Baby. Baby.
- Why would you do that, Bessie?

1173
01:36:34,417 --> 01:36:35,875
Baby.

1174
01:36:44,834 --> 01:36:46,750
Why you do that?

1175
01:36:48,917 --> 01:36:51,166
Why you do that?

1176
01:36:51,250 --> 01:36:54,041
Why you do that?

1177
01:36:55,834 --> 01:36:58,709
You're gonna kill me too.

1178
01:37:07,208 --> 01:37:08,125
No.

1179
01:37:15,041 --> 01:37:16,667
I'm so sorry.

1180
01:37:21,625 --> 01:37:23,458
I'm so sorry, baby.

1181
01:37:27,500 --> 01:37:29,959
Baby, I'm so sorry.

1182
01:37:34,959 --> 01:37:36,542
I'm so...

1183
01:37:41,583 --> 01:37:43,125
Bessie, I'm s...

1184
01:37:45,375 --> 01:37:47,750
I'm so sorry.

1185
01:37:57,166 --> 01:37:58,875
I'm so sorry.

1186
01:38:48,166 --> 01:38:52,208
♪ Doo doo ♪

1187
01:38:52,291 --> 01:38:56,417
♪ Doo doo ♪

1188
01:39:41,333 --> 01:39:42,750
Stop!

1189
01:39:42,834 --> 01:39:45,208
Put your fuckin' hands
in the air!

1190
01:40:19,208 --> 01:40:20,750
Put 'em up!

1191
01:40:22,583 --> 01:40:25,041
Put your hands in the air.

1192
01:40:32,667 --> 01:40:34,417
Don't fuckin' do it.

1193
01:40:58,625 --> 01:41:00,542
In it...

1194
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:03,709
and of it...

1195
01:41:03,792 --> 01:41:07,250
and now flyin' high
and above it.

1196
01:41:09,417 --> 01:41:11,959
Lookin' down on the whole earth.

1197
01:41:14,333 --> 01:41:17,875
Wish that it was different...

1198
01:41:17,959 --> 01:41:19,750
but it ain't.

1199
01:41:22,458 --> 01:41:23,959
Not yet.

1200
01:41:25,750 --> 01:41:27,625
Not yet.
