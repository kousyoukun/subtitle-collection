Got "A," got "B," got "E."

I don't think Gus is in.

331
00:20:50,834 --> 00:20:53,625
Yeah, that's 'cause Gus
don't need the opportunity.

Just me, you, Big.

You got it all planned out?

334
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:08,166
Man, it's like we practically
already done it.

Yeah.

You don't want
to nothin' authentic.

Instead of looking
and acting like a real brother,

Hey.

create a multimillion-dollar fund

to give low-cost loans
to developers.

The loans then
would be used for...
