1
00:00:00,194 --> 00:00:04,722
Kind of looks like it's waving, you know.


2
00:00:04,798 --> 00:00:06,060
Like it's saying...


3
00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:08,863
"Hey, Vanessa, will you be my mom?''


4
00:00:08,936 --> 00:00:10,403
Oh, it kind of does.


5
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:11,836
Right?


6
00:00:11,905 --> 00:00:14,203
Juno was nice enough to bring that over for us today.


7
00:00:14,274 --> 00:00:15,400
Yeah, I came as soon


8
00:00:15,476 --> 00:00:17,808
as I got that ultrasound goo off my pelvis.


9
00:00:17,878 --> 00:00:19,971
It was crazy actually.


10
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:23,016
My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech


11
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,643
and we got escorted off the premises.


12
00:00:29,023 --> 00:00:31,651
Wow, what kind of swag did you score?


13
00:00:31,725 --> 00:00:33,625
Mall madness, huh?


14
00:00:33,694 --> 00:00:35,787
It's just some stuff I picked up for the baby.


15
00:00:35,863 --> 00:00:38,855
Don't you usually get all that stuff at like a baby shower?


16
00:00:38,932 --> 00:00:41,366
'Cause my stepmom she was pregnant with my little sister


17
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:43,665
and she got a million gifts, you know?


18
00:00:43,737 --> 00:00:44,726
But I wasn't jealous,


19
00:00:44,805 --> 00:00:46,033
'cause they all super lame.


20
00:00:46,106 --> 00:00:47,903
I doubt anyone's going to throw us a shower.


21
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:49,704
Why wouldn't they throw you a baby shower?


22
00:00:49,777 --> 00:00:50,801
I don't think people know...


23
00:00:50,878 --> 00:00:53,472
how to feel about the situation


24
00:00:53,547 --> 00:00:56,710
because it's... not set in stone.


25
00:00:56,784 --> 00:00:58,115
What isn't set?


26
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:01,219
No, no, no, no, no.


27
00:01:01,288 --> 00:01:03,483
You don't think that I'm going to flake out on you?


28
00:01:03,557 --> 00:01:04,956
No, I don't,Juno.


29
00:01:05,025 --> 00:01:07,016
We went through a situation before


30
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:08,493
where it didn't work out.


31
00:01:08,562 --> 00:01:10,325
Yeah, cold feet.


32
00:01:10,397 --> 00:01:12,024
Oh.


33
00:01:15,502 --> 00:01:17,402
You should have gone to China.


34
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:20,235
You know, 'cause I hear they give away babies


35
00:01:20,307 --> 00:01:21,331
like free iPods.


36
00:01:21,408 --> 00:01:22,807
You know,


37
00:01:22,876 --> 00:01:24,935
they pretty much just put them in those Tshirt guns


38
00:01:25,012 --> 00:01:26,536
and shoot them out at sporting events.


39
00:01:28,882 --> 00:01:31,817
Your parents are probably wondering where you are.


40
00:01:31,885 --> 00:01:34,161
Nah. I mean, I'm already pregnant,


41
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,681
so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into?


42
00:01:36,757 --> 00:01:39,658
Though, I should... I should probably bounce.


43
00:01:39,727 --> 00:01:40,819
Hey, don't forget your bag.


44
00:01:40,894 --> 00:01:42,293
Oh, bag.


45
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:44,474
Thank you.


46
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,097
Okay, take care.


47
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:12,885
Where the hell have you been,June bug?


48
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,418
I just drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.


49
00:02:16,497 --> 00:02:18,556
I ended up staying for a couple hours.


50
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:19,860
A couple hours?!


51
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:21,730
What are you going over there in the first place?


52
00:02:21,802 --> 00:02:25,238
Oh, they just... you know, they wanted to know about the stuff


53
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:27,535
and I said I'd keep them updated, so I did.


54
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:29,269
Well, you could have mailed it to them.


55
00:02:29,343 --> 00:02:32,176
Why would you drive an hour out to EastJesus Nowhere?


56
00:02:32,246 --> 00:02:34,737
~ Mmmm! ~ I just did.


57
00:02:34,815 --> 00:02:37,283
You know, and while Mark and I were waiting for Vanessa,


58
00:02:37,351 --> 00:02:39,581
we, uh, we watched The Wizard of Gore


59
00:02:39,653 --> 00:02:41,917
and then he burnt me


60
00:02:41,989 --> 00:02:43,820
a couple CDs of this weird music.


61
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:46,086
So, it was cool. He's kind of cool.


62
00:02:47,828 --> 00:02:52,231
Juno, you can't just drop in on them like that.


63
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:54,974
No, it... it was not a big deal.


64
00:02:54,974 --> 00:02:56,329
He was totally cool with it.


65
00:02:56,403 --> 00:02:57,700
You don't understand.


66
00:02:57,771 --> 00:02:59,170
Mark is a married man.


67
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:00,399
There are boundaries.


68
00:03:00,474 --> 00:03:02,465
Oh, come on.


69
00:03:02,543 --> 00:03:05,137
Listen, Brenda...


70
00:03:05,212 --> 00:03:07,578
Now you're acting like you're the one


71
00:03:07,648 --> 00:03:09,343
who has to go through this.


72
00:03:09,416 --> 00:03:11,407
Like you're the one who has to get huge


73
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:13,851
and shove a baby out of your vag for someone else.


74
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:15,821
And what does it even matter if he's married?


75
00:03:15,889 --> 00:03:16,787
I can have friends that are married.


76
00:03:16,787 --> 00:03:18,411
It doesn't work that way, kiddo.


77
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:20,723
You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.


78
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:22,557
You don't know anything about me.


79
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:24,290
I know enough.


80
00:03:26,033 --> 00:03:27,728
We don't even have a dog.


81
00:03:27,801 --> 00:03:29,268
Yeah, we don't have a dog


82
00:03:29,336 --> 00:03:30,735
because you're allergic to their saliva.


83
00:03:30,804 --> 00:03:32,795
I have sacrificed a lot


84
00:03:32,873 --> 00:03:35,341
for you,Juno, and in a couple years, when you move out,


85
00:03:35,409 --> 00:03:37,274
I'm going to get Weimaraners.


86
00:03:37,344 --> 00:03:39,209
Oh, dream big.


87
00:03:39,279 --> 00:03:42,248
Oh, go fly a kite!


88
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:06,267
Hey,Juno.


89
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,274
What can I do for you?


90
00:04:08,342 --> 00:04:10,606
Uh, Bleeker home?


91
00:04:10,677 --> 00:04:13,612
Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive once,


92
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,974
but now she looks like a hobbit.


93
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:20,149
You know the fat one that was in The Goonies?


94
00:04:26,593 --> 00:04:28,060
Hey, man.


95
00:04:28,128 --> 00:04:29,599
Don't concentrate so hard.


96
00:04:29,599 --> 00:04:31,887
I think I can smell your hair aburnin'.


97
00:04:31,965 --> 00:04:33,091
Hey, what's up?


98
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:36,067
Not much. I just... wanted to come say hey.


99
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:38,366
I mean, I miss like...just hanging out with you


100
00:04:38,438 --> 00:04:40,786
on school nights, you know.


101
00:04:41,974 --> 00:04:44,604
Orange tic tacs are Bleeker's one and only vice.


102
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:46,270
The day I got pregnant,


103
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:49,247
his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious.


104
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,918
Boy, you really...


105
00:04:58,992 --> 00:05:02,086
really seem to be getting, uh, pregnanter these days.


106
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:03,322
Yeah.


107
00:05:05,065 --> 00:05:07,898
You know, I set up this whole private adoption,


108
00:05:07,968 --> 00:05:09,959
and this... this married couple


109
00:05:10,037 --> 00:05:12,403
in like St. Cloud, they're... they're going to be the parents.


110
00:05:12,472 --> 00:05:13,530
 So, it's...　　　　 Really?


111
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:14,869
Yeah.


112
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:16,204
Wow, what are they like?


113
00:05:16,276 --> 00:05:19,803
Well, I mean, the guy he's awesome.


114
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,041
His name is Mark and, um...


115
00:05:22,115 --> 00:05:23,707
he likes old horror movies


116
00:05:23,784 --> 00:05:25,342
and he plays the guitar.


117
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,387
We actually hung out this afternoon.


118
00:05:27,454 --> 00:05:29,183
Is that normal?


119
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:30,985
Probably not, but...


120
00:05:31,058 --> 00:05:33,083
Listen, I talked


121
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,349
to Dad and Bren and they said


122
00:05:35,349 --> 00:05:37,153
they wouldn't narc you out to your folks, so...


123
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:38,754
Okay.


124
00:05:38,832 --> 00:05:40,459
I think we should be cool, you know?


125
00:05:40,534 --> 00:05:42,263
That's a relief.


126
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:51,605
I'm gonna start looking like a pretty big dork soon.


127
00:05:51,678 --> 00:05:55,876
You still going to think I'm cute when I'm huge?


128
00:05:55,949 --> 00:05:59,043
I always think you're cute.


129
00:05:59,119 --> 00:06:00,347
I think you're beautiful.


130
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,752
Geez, Bleek.


131
00:06:02,823 --> 00:06:04,882
I do.


132
00:06:07,673 --> 00:06:10,220
Hey,June bug, you know, when this is all over


133
00:06:10,297 --> 00:06:11,855
we should get the band back together.


134
00:06:11,932 --> 00:06:15,368
Yeah. I mean, that would be... that would be awesome.


135
00:06:15,435 --> 00:06:18,063
I mean, once Tino gets the new drumhead,


136
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:20,038
we're just, like, ready to rock.


137
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:21,734
And, I mean, we could...


138
00:06:21,808 --> 00:06:23,969
we could always get back together, too.


139
00:06:24,044 --> 00:06:25,170
It's an option.


140
00:06:27,614 --> 00:06:31,380
Oh... were we together?


141
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:36,787
Yeah, we were once, you know... that... that time.


142
00:06:43,563 --> 00:06:45,497
What about Katrina De Voort?


143
00:06:45,565 --> 00:06:47,362
You could totally go out with Katrina De Voort.


144
00:06:47,434 --> 00:06:48,492
I don't like Katrina.


145
00:06:48,568 --> 00:06:50,092
She smells like soup.


146
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:51,933
I mean, have you ever smelled her?


147
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:53,973
And her whole house smells like soup.


148
00:07:02,315 --> 00:07:03,612
Okay...


149
00:07:03,683 --> 00:07:09,568
So we have custard and cheesecake.


150
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:11,151
They're yellow.


151
00:07:11,224 --> 00:07:14,557
Right. I wanted to pick something that was genderneutral


152
00:07:14,628 --> 00:07:17,153
until we get the baby and then we can just add


153
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,697
a more decisive palette.


154
00:07:18,765 --> 00:07:20,960
Why does everybody think yellow is genderneutral?


155
00:07:21,034 --> 00:07:22,865
 I don't know any guy with a yellow bedroom.


156
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:24,663
It's for babies.


157
00:07:24,738 --> 00:07:27,605
I'm thinking more custard.


158
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:29,073
Just with this light.


159
00:07:29,142 --> 00:07:31,667
I don't know, maybe I should I should paint a larger swatch


160
00:07:31,745 --> 00:07:34,145
or just try it on a different wall...


161
00:07:37,117 --> 00:07:39,176
Or you can wait a few more months.


162
00:07:39,252 --> 00:07:41,277
Like the baby's going to come storming in here


163
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:43,185
demanding dessertcolored walls.


164
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:51,194
What to Expect says that readying the baby's room


165
00:07:51,264 --> 00:07:53,994
is an important process for the woman.


166
00:07:54,067 --> 00:07:55,728
Especially if you're adopting.


167
00:07:55,802 --> 00:07:57,326
It's called " nesting.''


168
00:07:57,404 --> 00:07:58,871
Nesting?


169
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:00,668
Yeah.


170
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,301
Are you going to build a crib out of sticks and spit?


171
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:06,004
Hmm?


172
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,774
Well, you should read the book.


173
00:08:07,848 --> 00:08:10,180
I flagged the daddy chapters. They're...


174
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:11,808
I think it's too early to paint.


175
00:08:11,885 --> 00:08:13,477
That's my opinion.


176
00:08:13,553 --> 00:08:16,021
I disagree.


177
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,994
This wall is going to need something.


178
00:08:25,232 --> 00:08:27,063
Our first family photo right in the middle.


179
00:08:27,134 --> 00:08:29,193
Right up there.


180
00:08:31,204 --> 00:08:33,866
Can you see it?


181
00:08:37,577 --> 00:08:40,546
Yum! This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut.


182
00:08:40,614 --> 00:08:41,638
Well, share the love, sweetie.


183
00:08:41,715 --> 00:08:43,740
No, you can't have any.


184
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:46,183
She's assaulting me.


185
00:08:46,253 --> 00:08:48,983
She's denying me freshbaked goodness.


186
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:50,920
 Oh, my God.　　　　 What?


187
00:08:50,991 --> 00:08:52,390
That's her.


188
00:08:52,459 --> 00:08:54,393
That's Vanessa Loring.


189
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:55,951
Of the PennySaver Lorings?


190
00:08:58,098 --> 00:09:02,000
Dude, she's, like, really pretty.


191
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:03,865
You sound, like, totally shocked or something.


192
00:09:03,937 --> 00:09:08,431
She's totally going to, like, steal that little kid for her collection.


193
00:09:08,508 --> 00:09:10,442
Right? Seriously.


194
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:20,486
Boring.


195
00:09:20,554 --> 00:09:22,181
Ah...


196
00:09:29,596 --> 00:09:32,724
Oh, I could so go for, like, a huge cookie right now


197
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:35,495
with, like, a lamb kebab simultaneously.


198
00:09:35,569 --> 00:09:38,663
God, spermie, must you always feed?


199
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:42,572
It's like never ending, pretty much, you know.


200
00:09:42,642 --> 00:09:43,904
Juno!


201
00:09:43,977 --> 00:09:45,239
 Hi.　　　　 Hi,Juno.


202
00:09:45,312 --> 00:09:47,974
Vanessa, what, what brings you to the mall today?


203
00:09:48,048 --> 00:09:51,074
I was just shopping, you know, with my girlfriends, and...


204
00:09:51,151 --> 00:09:52,482
You're gay?


205
00:09:52,552 --> 00:09:53,814
 No.　　　　 Oh, please,just ignore her.


206
00:09:53,887 --> 00:09:55,218
Okay.


207
00:09:55,288 --> 00:09:56,755
Well, how are you feeling?


208
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:59,451
Great. Everything's stupendous, you know.


209
00:09:59,526 --> 00:10:02,290
Oh, coming in on that snooze button.


210
00:10:02,362 --> 00:10:05,695
Wow. It's incredible.


211
00:10:05,765 --> 00:10:07,596
Huh. Oh, God.


212
00:10:07,667 --> 00:10:09,498
What?


213
00:10:09,569 --> 00:10:12,060
Kicking... kicking away.


214
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:16,835
Could... could I feel it?


215
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:18,468
Are you kidding?


216
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,103
Oh.


217
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:21,579
God, that's cool.


218
00:10:21,648 --> 00:10:23,843
Everyone's just, like, grabbing my belly all the time.


219
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:25,782
It's crazy, but I'm a legend, you know.


220
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:27,376
They call me the cautionary whale.


221
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:33,222
I can't feel anything.


222
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:38,463
It's not moving for me.


223
00:10:38,531 --> 00:10:40,658
Well, you should try talking to it,


224
00:10:40,734 --> 00:10:42,497
'cause, like, supposedly they can hear you


225
00:10:42,569 --> 00:10:45,367
even though it's all, like, 1 0,000 leagues under the sea.


226
00:10:59,819 --> 00:11:01,810
Hi, baby.


227
00:11:03,523 --> 00:11:05,457
Um...


228
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:07,083
It's me.


229
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:09,151
It's... Vanessa.


230
00:11:13,633 --> 00:11:15,624
I can't wait to meet you.


231
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:25,975
Can you hear me, baby?


232
00:11:26,046 --> 00:11:28,037
Sweet angel?


233
00:11:38,325 --> 00:11:39,587
I felt him!


234
00:11:39,659 --> 00:11:41,559
Oh, God.


235
00:11:41,628 --> 00:11:44,256
That was magical.


236
00:11:48,268 --> 00:11:51,863
Thank you. Thank you.


237
00:12:03,383 --> 00:12:05,783
~ Elope with me, Miss Private ~


238
00:12:05,852 --> 00:12:08,661
~ And we'll sail around the world ~


239
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,785
~ I will be your Ferdinand and you my wayward girl ~


240
00:12:12,859 --> 00:12:16,989
~ How many nights of talking in hotel rooms can you take? ~


241
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:21,727
~ How many nights of limping 'round some pagan holidays? ~


242
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:23,666
~ Oh, elope with me in private ~


243
00:12:23,737 --> 00:12:26,262
~ And we'll set something ablaze ~


244
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:30,070
~ A trail for the devil to erase... ~


245
00:12:30,143 --> 00:12:33,010
~ And... if you can't, if you can't decide ~


246
00:12:33,079 --> 00:12:35,240
~ Between a little breakfast and lunch ~


247
00:12:35,315 --> 00:12:37,306
~ Why don't you microwave yourself ~


248
00:12:37,384 --> 00:12:40,444
~ A little bowl of brunch? ~


249
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,779
Hello?


250
00:12:44,858 --> 00:12:45,847
Hey!


251
00:12:45,925 --> 00:12:46,914
Hi.


252
00:12:46,993 --> 00:12:47,982
So, um,


253
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:49,050
I've been listening to that


254
00:12:49,129 --> 00:12:50,426
really weird CD that you made me.


255
00:12:50,497 --> 00:12:51,794
Yeah, what's the verdict?


256
00:12:51,865 --> 00:12:53,526
Well, it's cute.


257
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,363
"It's cute''?


258
00:12:55,435 --> 00:12:56,424
When you're used to listening


259
00:12:56,503 --> 00:12:58,334
to the raw power of Iggy and The Stooges,


260
00:12:58,405 --> 00:13:00,373
everything else just sounds kind of like...


261
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:01,839
precious in comparison.


262
00:13:01,908 --> 00:13:03,474
Well, I imagine you've got


263
00:13:03,474 --> 00:13:04,308
a collection of punk chestnuts


264
00:13:04,377 --> 00:13:05,435
to prove your point.


265
00:13:05,512 --> 00:13:09,312
Well... consider it your musical education.


266
00:13:09,382 --> 00:13:11,714
Can't wait to see what you've got to teach me.


267
00:13:11,785 --> 00:13:14,345
Stop surfing porn and get back to work.


268
00:13:15,622 --> 00:13:17,522
I just wanted to call and say hi.


269
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:19,888
Right. Go learn something.


270
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:23,522
I'll have a little trip down Mexico way.


271
00:13:23,596 --> 00:13:26,064
And Greece and China apparently.


272
00:13:26,132 --> 00:13:27,690
How many months has it been now?


273
00:13:27,767 --> 00:13:28,825
You're getting huge.


274
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:31,200
Oh, it's honing in on eight.


275
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:33,102
You should see how weird I look naked.


276
00:13:33,173 --> 00:13:35,107
I wish my fun bags would get bigger.


277
00:13:35,175 --> 00:13:36,767
God, trust me, you don't.


278
00:13:36,843 --> 00:13:39,277
I have to actually wear a frickin' bra now


279
00:13:39,345 --> 00:13:42,075
and rub all this nasty cocoa butter stuff on myself


280
00:13:42,148 --> 00:13:44,412
so, like... I don't know, my skin won't explode.


281
00:13:44,484 --> 00:13:45,644
Hot.


282
00:13:48,721 --> 00:13:50,814
Why is everyone always staring at me?


283
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,688
Well, you are kind of convex, you know.


284
00:13:55,261 --> 00:13:57,354
Who's been doing their geometry homework for once?


285
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:58,727
I have no choice.


286
00:13:58,798 --> 00:14:01,528
Keith's been grading me, like, so hard lately.


287
00:14:01,601 --> 00:14:04,069
Do not call Mr. Connors Keith.


288
00:14:04,137 --> 00:14:04,661
Why?


289
00:14:04,661 --> 00:14:07,596
'Cause my barf reflex is really heightened these days.


290
00:14:07,674 --> 00:14:08,732
But Keith's hot.


291
00:14:08,808 --> 00:14:13,575
Ew, he's all beardy.


292
00:14:13,646 --> 00:14:16,599
Did you hear that Bleek is going to prom


293
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:17,582
with Katrina De Voort?


294
00:14:17,650 --> 00:14:20,448
Katrina?!


295
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:22,454
No, way, no, he doesn't like Katrina.


296
00:14:22,522 --> 00:14:24,114
Must be, like, a pity date or something.


297
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,179
I heard he asked her.


298
00:14:25,258 --> 00:14:26,987
And that they're going to Benihana


299
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:29,927
and then prom and then Vijay's parents' cabin.


300
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:31,156
Oh, what're you talk...


301
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:33,199
He told me that Katrina's house smells like soup.


302
00:14:33,266 --> 00:14:34,790
Oh. Oh, my God, it totally does.


303
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:37,132
I was there, like, four years ago for a birthday party.


304
00:14:37,203 --> 00:14:39,228
Oh, my God, it's like Lipton Landing.


305
00:14:39,305 --> 00:14:43,036
But, you know, boys have endured way worse things for nookie.


306
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:44,599
Oh, please.


307
00:14:44,677 --> 00:14:46,872
There is no way that they're having sex.


308
00:14:46,946 --> 00:14:49,073
I mean, they wouldn't even be holding hands.


309
00:14:49,148 --> 00:14:50,911
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure. He did it with you.


310
00:14:50,984 --> 00:14:52,918
Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me, you know.


311
00:14:52,986 --> 00:14:54,419
We're best friends.


312
00:14:54,487 --> 00:14:56,284
Are you jealous?


313
00:14:56,356 --> 00:14:58,415
I thought you said you didn't care what he did.


314
00:14:58,491 --> 00:15:00,425
Not jealous, don't care.


315
00:15:00,493 --> 00:15:02,859
It's just, I know Bleek doesn't like Katrina, you know.


316
00:15:02,929 --> 00:15:04,521
He shouldn't toy with her emotions like that,


317
00:15:04,597 --> 00:15:05,962
'cause she seems pretty nice.


318
00:15:06,032 --> 00:15:08,296
Uhhuh, I'm really convinced.


319
00:15:08,368 --> 00:15:09,995
You know, prom is for weenuses anyway.


320
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:13,766
As soon as you you're old enough to go, it's so not cool anymore.


321
00:15:22,382 --> 00:15:24,536
Are you honestly and truly going to prom


322
00:15:24,536 --> 00:15:25,909
with Katrina De Voort?


323
00:15:25,985 --> 00:15:27,865
Uh, hi.


324
00:15:27,865 --> 00:15:30,599
Leah justjust said that you were going to go with her.


325
00:15:30,599 --> 00:15:33,662
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go.


326
00:15:33,662 --> 00:15:34,349
Um, a bunch of us from the team


327
00:15:34,349 --> 00:15:36,193
are going to go to Benihana and then go to the prom


328
00:15:36,262 --> 00:15:38,287
and then go to Vijay's parents' cabin,


329
00:15:38,364 --> 00:15:40,298
so...


330
00:15:40,366 --> 00:15:43,767
Wewewe're getting a stretch limo.


331
00:15:43,836 --> 00:15:47,135
Your mom must be pretty stoked that you're not taking me.


332
00:15:47,206 --> 00:15:50,073
You're mad. Why are you mad?


333
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:51,906
I'm not mad. I'm in a...


334
00:15:51,978 --> 00:15:53,707
I'm in a great mood.


335
00:15:53,780 --> 00:15:55,509
I mean, despite the fact that well, I'm in a fat suit


336
00:15:55,582 --> 00:15:57,015
that I can't take off and despite the fact


337
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:59,813
that pretty much everyone's making fun of me behind my back


338
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:02,286
and despite the fact that your little girlfriend


339
00:16:02,355 --> 00:16:04,823
gave me the stink eye in art class yesterday...


340
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:05,949
Katrina's not my girlfriend, all right?


341
00:16:06,025 --> 00:16:07,617
And I doubt that she gave you the stink eye.


342
00:16:07,694 --> 00:16:09,628
That's just... the way her face looks, you know.


343
00:16:09,696 --> 00:16:11,220
That's just her face.


344
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:16,368
Yeah, what... Youyou just take Soupy Sales to prom.


345
00:16:16,436 --> 00:16:18,870
I can think of so many cooler things to do that night.


346
00:16:18,938 --> 00:16:20,114
Like, you know what, Bleek?


347
00:16:20,114 --> 00:16:21,304
I might pumice my feet.


348
00:16:21,374 --> 00:16:23,467
I might go to Bren's dumb Unitarian Church.


349
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:26,307
Maybe get hit by a truck full of hot garbage juice, you know,


350
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:28,813
'cause all those things would be exponentially cooler


351
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,712
than going to prom with you.


352
00:16:33,386 --> 00:16:35,650
You're being really immature.


353
00:16:35,722 --> 00:16:38,054
You have no reason to be mad at me.


354
00:16:38,124 --> 00:16:40,388
I mean, you know, you broke my heart.


355
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:43,224
I... I should be royally ticked off at you, you know.


356
00:16:43,296 --> 00:16:44,558
I should be really cheesed off.


357
00:16:44,631 --> 00:16:46,929
I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.


358
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:50,060
Ooh, what, 'cause I got bored and had sex with you


359
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:52,263
and I didn't want to, like, marry you?


360
00:16:52,338 --> 00:16:54,272
Like I'd marry you? You'd be the meanest wife ever,


361
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:56,740
okay? And I know that you weren't bored that day,


362
00:16:56,809 --> 00:16:58,674
because there was a lot of stuff on TV,


363
00:16:58,745 --> 00:17:01,680
andand the Blair Witch Project was coming on Starz.


364
00:17:01,748 --> 00:17:04,080
And you were like, " I haven't seen this since it came out.''


365
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,515
And if so, we should watch it.


366
00:17:05,585 --> 00:17:08,247
And then but, " Oh, no, we should make out instead,'' la, la, la.


367
00:17:09,722 --> 00:17:12,623
You just, you just take Katrina the douche packer to prom.


368
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:15,957
I'm, I'm sure you two will have, like, a real bitchin' time.


369
00:17:16,029 --> 00:17:18,964
Well, I still have your underwear.


370
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:20,966
I still... I have your virginity.


371
00:17:21,034 --> 00:17:23,093
Would you shut up?


372
00:17:23,169 --> 00:17:24,693
What, are you ashamed that we did it?


373
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:25,911
No.


374
00:17:25,911 --> 00:17:27,470
Because at least you don't have to have


375
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,508
the evidence under your sweater.


376
00:17:31,344 --> 00:17:33,676
I'm a planet.


377
00:17:36,616 --> 00:17:38,140
Wait, wait, let me get your bag.


378
00:17:38,217 --> 00:17:39,309
You shouldn't be carrying...


379
00:17:39,385 --> 00:17:40,875
What's another ten pounds?


380
00:17:53,733 --> 00:17:55,166
~ Monday morning wake up ~


381
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:57,794
~ Knowing that you got to go to school~


382
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,462
~ Tell you mum what to expect ~


383
00:17:59,539 --> 00:18:01,803
~ She says it's right out of the blue ~


384
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,739
~ Do you want to work in Debenham's? ~


385
00:18:03,810 --> 00:18:05,675
~ 'Cause that's what they expect ~


386
00:18:05,745 --> 00:18:09,772
~ Start in lingerie, and Doris is your supervisor ~


387
00:18:13,486 --> 00:18:15,818
~ And the head said that you always ~


388
00:18:15,888 --> 00:18:17,947
~ Were a queer one from the start ~


389
00:18:18,024 --> 00:18:18,849
~ For careers~


390
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:21,960
~you say you want to be remembered for your art ~


391
00:18:22,028 --> 00:18:23,723
~ Your obsession gets you known ~


392
00:18:23,796 --> 00:18:25,889
~ Throughout the school for being strange ~


393
00:18:25,965 --> 00:18:27,159
~ Making lifesize models... ~


394
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:28,825
 Hi. Wow.　　　　 Hi.


395
00:18:28,901 --> 00:18:30,129
Shirt's working hard.


396
00:18:30,203 --> 00:18:31,227
Is Vanessa here?


397
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:32,931
No. We are safe.


398
00:18:33,005 --> 00:18:34,438
Sweet.


399
00:18:34,507 --> 00:18:35,940
I'm glad you're here.


400
00:18:36,008 --> 00:18:38,476
I actually have something for you. Come here.


401
00:18:38,544 --> 00:18:40,068
~ And the rumor is you never go with boys~


402
00:18:40,068 --> 00:18:41,479
~ and you are tight... ~


403
00:18:41,547 --> 00:18:42,639
Almost there.


404
00:18:42,715 --> 00:18:44,273
~ So they jab you with a fork ~


405
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:46,147
~ You drop the tray and go berserk... ~


406
00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:48,551
Whoa, Mark, is this the baby's room?


407
00:18:48,621 --> 00:18:49,713
It's beautiful.


408
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:51,222
Oh, that's hilarious.


409
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:54,282
Now, this is where I keep all my old comics,


410
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:55,918
 Huh.　　　　 and I want to show you one.


411
00:18:55,995 --> 00:18:57,326
You're one of those guys?


412
00:18:57,396 --> 00:18:59,330
Take a look.


413
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:00,956
Huh?


414
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:04,231
Most Fruitful Yuki.


415
00:19:04,303 --> 00:19:05,327
Mmhmm.


416
00:19:05,404 --> 00:19:07,338
Is this a pregnant superhero?


417
00:19:07,406 --> 00:19:08,634
Isn't that great?


418
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,335
I found it in Japan when I was there with my band.


419
00:19:10,409 --> 00:19:11,398
It reminds me of you.


420
00:19:11,477 --> 00:19:13,911
 Hells, yeah!　　　　 Yeah.


421
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:17,711
This actually makes me feel way less of a fat dork.


422
00:19:17,784 --> 00:19:20,849
Well, Yuki is a real badass.


423
00:19:20,849 --> 00:19:22,853
You should be very proud to be in the same condition.


424
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:25,948
 Thank you.　　　　 Yeah.


425
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:27,151
Oh, how about some tuneage?


426
00:19:27,226 --> 00:19:28,784
 Tuneage?　　　　 Yeah.


427
00:19:28,861 --> 00:19:31,056
 I got a bunch...　　　　 All right, don't look. Numero trois.


428
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:32,324
Not looking.


429
00:19:32,398 --> 00:19:35,299
Um, okay, this one is actually kind of slow,


430
00:19:35,368 --> 00:19:39,327
but it's Mott The Hoople, so it's still totally rad...


431
00:19:39,405 --> 00:19:40,838
and hardcore.


432
00:19:45,077 --> 00:19:46,510
 What?　　　　 I know this one.


433
00:19:46,579 --> 00:19:47,773
 You do?　　　　 Yeah.


434
00:19:47,847 --> 00:19:50,281
This song is older than I am, if you can believe it.


435
00:19:50,349 --> 00:19:52,078
I danced to this at my senior prom.


436
00:19:52,151 --> 00:19:54,711
Who'd you dance with?


437
00:19:54,787 --> 00:19:57,517
Cynthia Vogel. Great dance partner.


438
00:19:57,590 --> 00:19:59,785
 She let me put my hands all over her butt.　　　　 Hot.


439
00:19:59,859 --> 00:20:00,917
Very hot.


440
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:04,827
I can just totally picture you dancing


441
00:20:04,897 --> 00:20:06,956
like a total dork.


442
00:20:07,033 --> 00:20:09,593
Actually...


443
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:12,069
her hands...


444
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,400
were there.


445
00:20:13,472 --> 00:20:15,201
I put my hands down here.


446
00:20:15,274 --> 00:20:17,902
Ththis, this... this is how we did it in '88.


447
00:20:17,977 --> 00:20:19,308
 Like this?　　　　Just like this.


448
00:20:19,378 --> 00:20:21,243
Have you ever been to a dance before?


449
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:23,874
Dances are for nerds and squares.


450
00:20:25,051 --> 00:20:26,484
What are you?


451
00:20:26,552 --> 00:20:28,645
I don't know.


452
00:20:29,989 --> 00:20:31,923
Does it feel like there's something between us?


453
00:20:33,759 --> 00:20:37,820
 ~ All the young dudes ~　　　　 ~ Hey, dudes ~


454
00:20:37,897 --> 00:20:40,331
~ Carry the news ~


455
00:20:40,399 --> 00:20:42,094
~ Where are you? ~


456
00:20:42,168 --> 00:20:43,999
~ Stand up ~


457
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:47,164
~ Carry the news ~


458
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:51,369
I'm leaving Vanessa.


459
00:20:51,444 --> 00:20:54,004
~ Carry the news ~


460
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,207
 What?!　　　　 Getting a place in the city.


461
00:20:56,282 --> 00:20:57,772
Got it all planned.


462
00:20:57,850 --> 00:21:00,444
This is something I've been wanting to do for a long time.


463
00:21:00,519 --> 00:21:01,713
 No.　　　　 No?


464
00:21:01,787 --> 00:21:03,982
No, you definitely... can't do that.


465
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:07,025
That's one big, fat sack of... no!


466
00:21:07,093 --> 00:21:09,618
 What is the matter?　　　　 Wh di I...


467
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:13,529
I mean... you guys are supposed to take care of this, you know?


468
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:17,301
 I thought you'd be cool with this.　　　　 Cool?


469
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,964
II want things to be perfect.


470
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,303
I don't want them to be shitty and broken


471
00:21:22,375 --> 00:21:23,967
like everyone else's family.


472
00:21:25,344 --> 00:21:27,209
Look, I'll have the baby,


473
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,578
and Vanessa's going to be so happy.


474
00:21:29,649 --> 00:21:31,048
You just...


475
00:21:31,117 --> 00:21:33,142
A baby's not going to fix everything, besides I don't know


476
00:21:33,219 --> 00:21:34,709
if I'm even ready to be a father.


477
00:21:34,787 --> 00:21:35,776
But you're old.


478
00:21:40,092 --> 00:21:41,719
How do you think of me?


479
00:21:42,895 --> 00:21:44,362
You know, why are you over here?


480
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:50,798
I... I just like being


481
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:53,304
a piece of furniture in your weird life.


482
00:21:53,372 --> 00:21:55,499
This? This is what my life has become.


483
00:21:55,574 --> 00:21:58,042
I mean, you know, I got stuff in boxes.


484
00:21:58,110 --> 00:21:59,134
You know, I'm underground.


485
00:21:59,211 --> 00:22:00,838
That's appealing to you?


486
00:22:00,913 --> 00:22:02,244
 Is this my fault?　　　　 No.


487
00:22:02,315 --> 00:22:03,224
Is Vanessa, like,


488
00:22:03,224 --> 00:22:04,749
mad at you because of me or something?


489
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,079
That's got nothing to do with it.


490
00:22:06,152 --> 00:22:07,380
Vanessa and I aren't in love anymore.


491
00:22:07,453 --> 00:22:09,421
Well, you were in love when you married her.


492
00:22:09,488 --> 00:22:12,082
And if you're in love once, you can be in love again


493
00:22:12,158 --> 00:22:14,217
like my friend, Leah, who's been with the same guy,


494
00:22:14,293 --> 00:22:15,817
like, four different times.


495
00:22:15,895 --> 00:22:17,863
 You're just not trying hard enough.　　　　 I'm such an idiot.


496
00:22:17,930 --> 00:22:19,158
I can't believe what an idiot I am.


497
00:22:19,231 --> 00:22:20,323
No, no, you know what, Mark...


498
00:22:20,399 --> 00:22:23,926
Just do not divorce your wife.


499
00:22:24,003 --> 00:22:26,164
Will you please just do me a solid


500
00:22:26,238 --> 00:22:27,899
and stay with Vanessa?


501
00:22:29,408 --> 00:22:30,568
You're so young.


502
00:22:30,643 --> 00:22:32,634
Oh, I'm not that young. Okay, I'm 1 6.


503
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:34,509
All right, I'm old enough to know when someone's


504
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,275
acting like a total ahole.


505
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:38,544
Oh, and you know what?


506
00:22:38,617 --> 00:22:41,415
I bought another Sonic Youth album and it sucks!


507
00:22:41,487 --> 00:22:43,148
It's just noise.


508
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:49,857
Juno? What's going on?


509
00:22:49,929 --> 00:22:52,193
Nothing.


510
00:22:52,264 --> 00:22:54,061
Why are you crying?


511
00:22:54,133 --> 00:22:55,623
I'm not crying,


512
00:22:55,701 --> 00:22:58,192
I'm just allergic to fine home furnishings.


513
00:22:58,270 --> 00:23:00,204
Hold on. What's the matter?


514
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:01,398
What's the matter?


515
00:23:01,474 --> 00:23:03,374
Just a little hormonal.


516
00:23:03,442 --> 00:23:04,636
Right,Juno?


517
00:23:04,710 --> 00:23:07,201
Just part of the process.


518
00:23:10,783 --> 00:23:12,148
What did you do?


519
00:23:14,186 --> 00:23:15,585
I didn't do anything.


520
00:23:15,654 --> 00:23:18,646
Just, um...


521
00:23:22,895 --> 00:23:24,487
I've been thinking...


522
00:23:24,563 --> 00:23:26,053
 What?　　　　 You know, I've just


523
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:28,657
I'm thinking if this is the right thing.


524
00:23:28,734 --> 00:23:31,032
What are you talking about?


525
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:34,566
Just wondering if it's...


526
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,971
just wondering if we're ready.


527
00:23:36,042 --> 00:23:38,510
Yeah, we're ready.


528
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:39,771
We're ready. We've read the books.


529
00:23:39,845 --> 00:23:41,039
We've taken all the classes.


530
00:23:41,113 --> 00:23:42,671
We've have a nursery


531
00:23:42,748 --> 00:23:44,010
 that is completely...　　　　 Vanessa.


532
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,448
I know we're prepared.


533
00:23:45,518 --> 00:23:47,850
I'm just wondering if...


534
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:50,718
I'm ready.


535
00:23:54,126 --> 00:23:55,115
Wait a minute.


536
00:23:55,194 --> 00:23:56,286
Wait,Juno,


537
00:23:56,362 --> 00:23:57,351
don't listen to him.


538
00:23:57,430 --> 00:23:58,863
He's just got cold feet.


539
00:23:58,931 --> 00:24:00,421
He's just being a guy.


540
00:24:00,499 --> 00:24:02,126
The books all say the same thing.


541
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:04,294
"A woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant.


542
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:06,964
A man becomes a father when he sees his baby.''


543
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,939
He's going to get there.


544
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:11,533
 He's... he's going to get there.　　　　 It happened so fast.


545
00:24:11,610 --> 00:24:13,407
You know, we put the ad in the paper


546
00:24:13,479 --> 00:24:16,380
and I thought that it was going to take months, if at all,


547
00:24:16,449 --> 00:24:18,474
and then, two weeks later, she's on that couch.


548
00:24:18,551 --> 00:24:20,212
Well, she answered our prayers.


549
00:24:20,286 --> 00:24:23,585
Ever since then, it's been, like, a ticking clock.


550
00:24:25,958 --> 00:24:28,483
What are you saying?


551
00:24:30,529 --> 00:24:32,759
That it feels a little like bad timing.


552
00:24:36,402 --> 00:24:39,064
What would be a good time for you, Mark?


553
00:24:40,573 --> 00:24:42,700
There's just some things that I still want to do.


554
00:24:42,775 --> 00:24:45,505
Like what? Be a rock star?


555
00:24:45,578 --> 00:24:47,569
Don't mock me.


556
00:24:48,948 --> 00:24:51,348
I'm just saying that this is...


557
00:24:51,417 --> 00:24:53,408
this is something that's never going to happen.


558
00:24:55,254 --> 00:24:57,449
You know...


559
00:24:57,523 --> 00:24:59,047
your shirt is stupid.


560
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:01,355
Grow up.


561
00:25:01,427 --> 00:25:04,123
If I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain,


562
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:06,096
I'm never going to be a mother.


563
00:25:09,768 --> 00:25:12,328
I never said I'd be a good father.


564
00:28:07,579 --> 00:28:09,911
I called Gerta Rouse and she said that


565
00:28:09,982 --> 00:28:11,950
she can represent both of us.


566
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:13,848
It's called a" collaborative divorce.''


567
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:17,013
It's all the rage right now, supposedly.


568
00:28:17,089 --> 00:28:18,249
It'd be pretty easy


569
00:28:18,324 --> 00:28:19,552
'cause we don't have any children.


570
00:28:19,625 --> 00:28:22,059
Thanks for making the call, I guess.


571
00:28:28,534 --> 00:28:31,094
Have you found a place to stay yet?


572
00:28:31,170 --> 00:28:32,797
Yeah, downtown.


573
00:28:32,871 --> 00:28:34,065
A hotel?


574
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:36,130
No, it's not a hotel, it's a loft.


575
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:39,238
Well, aren't you the cool guy.


576
00:28:44,717 --> 00:28:46,776
I wanted a baby so bad.


577
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:48,843
I know.


578
00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:10,193
This looks like a bill from Jun...


579
00:29:10,193 --> 00:29:11,349
It's for me.


580
00:29:53,552 --> 00:29:55,673
I never realize how much I like being home


581
00:29:55,673 --> 00:29:59,020
unless I've been somewhere really different for a while.


582
00:30:06,765 --> 00:30:08,027
Hey, Dad.


583
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:10,364
Hey, big puffy version ofJune bug.


584
00:30:10,436 --> 00:30:12,404
Where you been?


585
00:30:12,471 --> 00:30:16,168
Oh,just out dealing with things way beyond my maturity level.


586
00:30:18,143 --> 00:30:19,906
Where is everybody?


587
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:23,744
Well, Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot iceskating class.


588
00:30:23,816 --> 00:30:27,877
When will you guys learn that tots can't iceskate?


589
00:30:28,987 --> 00:30:31,080
You're looking a little morose, honey.


590
00:30:31,156 --> 00:30:32,521
What's eating you?


591
00:30:32,591 --> 00:30:34,991
Oh...


592
00:30:40,332 --> 00:30:43,824
I'm just, like, losing my faith with humanity.


593
00:30:43,902 --> 00:30:46,530
Wow, can you narrow that down for me?


594
00:30:46,605 --> 00:30:50,371
I just... wonder if, like,


595
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:54,173
two people can stay together for good.


596
00:30:54,246 --> 00:30:56,510
You mean, like couples?


597
00:30:56,582 --> 00:30:59,380
Yeah, like... people in love.


598
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:02,052
Are you having boy trouble?


599
00:31:02,052 --> 00:31:03,454
'Cause I got to be honest, I don't really much approve


600
00:31:03,522 --> 00:31:05,183
of you dating in your condition.


601
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:07,623
That's... that's kind of messed up.


602
00:31:07,693 --> 00:31:09,957
 No, Dad, it's not...　　　　 I mean, that's pretty skanky.


603
00:31:10,028 --> 00:31:12,553
Isn't that what you girls call it skanky?


604
00:31:12,631 --> 00:31:13,689
 Skivvy?　　　　 Please stop.


605
00:31:13,765 --> 00:31:15,027
Tore up from the floor up?


606
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:17,967
That's... that's not what it's about, it...


607
00:31:20,939 --> 00:31:24,849
I just... I need to know that it's possible


608
00:31:24,849 --> 00:31:28,211
that two people can stay happy together forever.


609
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:31,477
Well, it's not easy, that's for sure.


610
00:31:31,550 --> 00:31:34,212
And, uh, I don't have the best track record in the world,


611
00:31:34,286 --> 00:31:35,913
I know, but...


612
00:31:35,988 --> 00:31:38,149
I've been with your stepmother for ten years now,


613
00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:41,158
and, um, I'm proud to say, we're very happy.


614
00:31:42,327 --> 00:31:44,124
Look...


615
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:49,065
in my opinion, the best thing you can do is find a person


616
00:31:49,134 --> 00:31:53,400
who loves you for exactly what you are.


617
00:31:53,472 --> 00:31:55,770
Good mood, bad mood...


618
00:31:55,841 --> 00:31:58,275
ugly, pretty...


619
00:31:58,343 --> 00:31:59,867
handsome, what have you.


620
00:31:59,945 --> 00:32:02,849
The right person's still gonna think


621
00:32:02,849 --> 00:32:04,490
the sun shines out your ass.


622
00:32:07,185 --> 00:32:10,245
That's the kind of person that's worth sticking with.


623
00:32:10,322 --> 00:32:12,051
Yeah.


624
00:32:15,724 --> 00:32:18,125
Yeah, and I think I've found that person.


625
00:32:18,196 --> 00:32:20,426
Yeah, sure you have your dear old DAD.


626
00:32:21,864 --> 00:32:23,833
You know I'll always be there to love you and support you


627
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:26,664
no matter what kind of pickle you're in.


628
00:32:26,738 --> 00:32:28,330
Obviously.


629
00:32:33,512 --> 00:32:36,447
Dad, I think I'm just gonna like... shove out for a sec,


630
00:32:36,515 --> 00:32:38,881
but I won't be home late.


631
00:32:38,951 --> 00:32:40,851
Okay.


632
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,978
You were talking about me, right?


633
00:32:43,055 --> 00:32:45,523
Oh, yeah.


634
00:32:55,167 --> 00:32:58,261
 Come on!Tic tac ahoy!


635
00:33:06,244 --> 00:33:08,804
~ The flower said, "I wish I was a tree'' ~


636
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:13,112
~ The tree said, " I wish I could be a different kind of tree'' ~


637
00:33:13,185 --> 00:33:15,653
~ The cat wished that it was a bee ~


638
00:33:15,721 --> 00:33:18,053
~ The turtle wished that it could fly ~


639
00:33:18,123 --> 00:33:20,455
~ Really high into the sky ~


640
00:33:20,525 --> 00:33:25,019
~ Over rooftops and then dive deep into the sea ~


641
00:33:25,097 --> 00:33:27,292
~ And in the sea there is a fish ~


642
00:33:27,366 --> 00:33:29,766
~ A fish that has a secret wish ~


643
00:33:29,835 --> 00:33:34,602
~ A wish to be a big cactus with a pink flower on it ~


644
00:33:34,673 --> 00:33:36,903
~ And in the sea there is a fish ~


645
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:39,136
~ A fish that has a secret wish ~


646
00:33:39,211 --> 00:33:41,941
~ A wish to be a big cactus with a pink flower on it... ~


647
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:43,174
Hi.


648
00:33:43,248 --> 00:33:45,079
Hey, did you put, like,


649
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,448
a hundred things of tic tacs in my mailbox?


650
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,680
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was me.


651
00:33:49,755 --> 00:33:50,983
Why?


652
00:33:51,056 --> 00:33:53,286
Well, you know, they're your fave,


653
00:33:53,358 --> 00:33:55,553
and, uh, I mean, you can never have too many of your favorite


654
00:33:55,627 --> 00:33:56,685
onecalorie breath mints.


655
00:33:56,762 --> 00:33:57,990
So, I just thought I'd...


656
00:33:58,063 --> 00:33:59,189
Yeah, well, thanks.


657
00:33:59,264 --> 00:34:01,357
I, uh, I think I'm pretty much set


658
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,924
until college on the tic tac front.


659
00:34:04,002 --> 00:34:05,697
You know, Bleek, I was thinking...


660
00:34:05,771 --> 00:34:08,535
and I'm sorry I was such a huge bitch to you.


661
00:34:08,607 --> 00:34:10,074
You don't deserve it.


662
00:34:10,142 --> 00:34:13,134
It's okay, you know... it's okay.


663
00:34:13,211 --> 00:34:15,490
And also, um...


664
00:34:17,416 --> 00:34:19,782
I think I'm in love with you.


665
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,449
You mean, as friends?


666
00:34:23,522 --> 00:34:26,685
No. I mean, for real.


667
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:31,388
'Cause you're, like, the coolest person I've ever met,


668
00:34:31,463 --> 00:34:34,796
and you don't even have to try.


669
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:37,460
I try really hard, actually.


670
00:34:37,536 --> 00:34:39,731
You're, like, naturally smart,


671
00:34:39,805 --> 00:34:41,773
and you're not like everyone else.


672
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,035
You don't stare at my stomach all the time.


673
00:34:44,109 --> 00:34:47,272
You look at my face, and every time I see you,


674
00:34:47,345 --> 00:34:51,475
the baby starts kicking super hard.


675
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,108
It does?


676
00:35:02,928 --> 00:35:04,862
Wizard.


677
00:35:06,114 --> 00:35:07,455
I think it's 'cause my heart starts pounding


678
00:35:07,532 --> 00:35:09,329
every time I see you.


679
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:12,336
Mine, too.


680
00:35:12,404 --> 00:35:17,808
That's all I could ask for.


681
00:35:17,876 --> 00:35:20,640
You're golden, man.


682
00:35:22,647 --> 00:35:24,512
Can we make out now?


683
00:35:25,984 --> 00:35:27,144
Yeah.


684
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:29,653
~ I like boys with strong convictions ~


685
00:35:29,721 --> 00:35:31,951
~ And convicts with perfect diction ~


686
00:35:32,023 --> 00:35:34,184
~ Underdogs with good intentions ~


687
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:36,454
~ Amputees with stamp collections ~


688
00:35:36,528 --> 00:35:38,257
~ I like boys that like their mothers ~


689
00:35:38,330 --> 00:35:39,797
~ And I have a thing for... ~


690
00:35:39,865 --> 00:35:41,025
Hey, you know,


691
00:35:41,133 --> 00:35:44,159
you could go into early labor sucking face like that.


692
00:35:44,236 --> 00:35:45,828
~ We're not lovers ~


693
00:35:50,108 --> 00:35:52,633
~ You're so nice ~


694
00:35:52,878 --> 00:35:55,210
~ And you're so smart ~


695
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:59,580
~ You're such a good friend, I have to break your heart ~


696
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:01,676
~ I'll tell you that I love you ~


697
00:36:01,753 --> 00:36:03,880
~ Then I'll tear your world apart ~


698
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:07,118
~Just pretend I didn't tear your world apart... ~


699
00:36:07,192 --> 00:36:08,887
Dad!


700
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:11,087
What?!


701
00:36:11,163 --> 00:36:13,597
Dad, either I just peed my pants or, um...


702
00:36:13,665 --> 00:36:16,259
Or?!


703
00:36:16,334 --> 00:36:18,928
Thundercats are go!


704
00:36:19,004 --> 00:36:20,062
Fall out! Fall out!


705
00:36:20,138 --> 00:36:21,537
You okay?


706
00:36:21,606 --> 00:36:23,335
 Do you have the admittance form?　　　　 Got 'em!


707
00:36:23,408 --> 00:36:24,500
What about the parking stickers?


708
00:36:24,576 --> 00:36:25,736
I got 'em! You got Liberty Bell?!


709
00:36:25,811 --> 00:36:27,938
Oh, Liberty Bell. Oh, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie!


710
00:36:28,013 --> 00:36:29,947
~ You're so nice and you're so smart ~


711
00:36:30,015 --> 00:36:32,074
We're gonna have a baby! Yeah! Here we go!


712
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:35,176
~ You're such a good friend I have to break your heart ~


713
00:36:35,253 --> 00:36:36,652
All right, go!


714
00:36:36,721 --> 00:36:38,689
 ~ I'll tell you that I love you ~　　　　 Aah!


715
00:36:38,757 --> 00:36:40,224
 Aah!　　　　 ~ And I'll tear your world apart ~


716
00:36:40,292 --> 00:36:43,352
~Just pretend I didn't tear your world apart... ~


717
00:36:43,428 --> 00:36:44,486
Breathe! Breathe!


718
00:36:44,563 --> 00:36:46,622
Out of the way! Out of the way!


719
00:36:46,698 --> 00:36:48,893
Stop it. For God's sake, stop it.


720
00:36:48,967 --> 00:36:50,525
 Don't do that.　　　　 What?


721
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:53,435
 Don't...　　　　 But it's fun!


722
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,807
God, Bren, when do I get the friggin' spinal tap thing?!


723
00:36:57,876 --> 00:36:58,900
It's called a spinal block,


724
00:36:58,977 --> 00:37:00,376
and you can't have it yet, honey.


725
00:37:00,445 --> 00:37:02,709
The doctor said you're not dilated enough.


726
00:37:02,781 --> 00:37:04,544
Oh, come on! I mean, it's like...


727
00:37:04,616 --> 00:37:06,675
I have to wait for it to get worse?


728
00:37:06,751 --> 00:37:08,810
Why can't I just have the friggin' thing now?


729
00:37:08,887 --> 00:37:11,082
Well, honey, doctors are sadists who like to play God


730
00:37:11,156 --> 00:37:12,714
and watch lesser people scream.


731
00:37:13,925 --> 00:37:16,155
Oh, shit! Uh, excuse me!


732
00:37:16,228 --> 00:37:18,321
Hey, could we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?!


733
00:37:18,396 --> 00:37:20,660
Breath and push.


734
00:37:20,732 --> 00:37:22,256
 That's good.　　　　 Keep pushing.


735
00:37:22,334 --> 00:37:25,701
Keep pushing, keep pushing...


736
00:37:30,942 --> 00:37:34,343
~ You're a parttime lover and a fulltime friend ~


737
00:37:34,412 --> 00:37:37,745
~ The monkey on your back is the latest trend ~


738
00:37:37,816 --> 00:37:43,777
~ I don't see what anyone can see in anyone else ~


739
00:37:43,855 --> 00:37:47,586
 ~ But you... ~　　　　 ~ I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of the train...~


740
00:37:48,894 --> 00:37:54,799
And then, out of nowhere, there it was...


741
00:37:54,866 --> 00:37:57,801
there he was.


742
00:37:57,869 --> 00:38:00,497
~ Here is the church and here is the steeple ~


743
00:38:00,572 --> 00:38:02,767
~ We sure are cute for two ugly people... ~


744
00:38:02,841 --> 00:38:04,206
I decided not to call Bleeker


745
00:38:04,276 --> 00:38:06,107
to tell him that I was having the baby.


746
00:38:06,177 --> 00:38:08,338
He had a big meet against Manteno


747
00:38:08,413 --> 00:38:12,042
and I didn't want him to get all worried about me.


748
00:38:12,117 --> 00:38:14,915
Paulie Bleeker has just broken a district record...


749
00:38:14,986 --> 00:38:17,648
But he figured it out anyway.


750
00:38:23,962 --> 00:38:26,556
~ But you. ~


751
00:38:35,006 --> 00:38:39,340
Someday, you'll be back here, honey...


752
00:38:39,411 --> 00:38:42,175
on your terms.


753
00:38:52,123 --> 00:38:54,057
Hi.


754
00:38:54,125 --> 00:38:57,151
Nice legs.


755
00:39:30,195 --> 00:39:33,130
~ Come with me ~


756
00:39:33,198 --> 00:39:36,793
~ My love ~


757
00:39:36,868 --> 00:39:38,460
~ To the sea... ~


758
00:39:38,536 --> 00:39:41,869
Bleeker decided he didn't want to see the baby.


759
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:43,874
Neither did I really.


760
00:39:43,942 --> 00:39:46,934
He didn't feel like ours.


761
00:39:48,513 --> 00:39:52,449
~ ...How much... ~


762
00:39:52,517 --> 00:39:55,111
I think he was always hers.


763
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:01,258
Would you like to meet your son?


764
00:40:01,326 --> 00:40:04,124
I have a son.


765
00:40:05,163 --> 00:40:11,932
~ Do you remember when we met ~


766
00:40:12,003 --> 00:40:14,597
~ That's the day ~


767
00:40:14,672 --> 00:40:18,108
~ I knew you were my pet ~


768
00:40:18,176 --> 00:40:23,113
~ I wanna tell you... ~


769
00:40:23,181 --> 00:40:24,273
I'm gonna...


770
00:40:24,349 --> 00:40:25,941
~ How much... ~


771
00:40:26,017 --> 00:40:27,951
I'm your...


772
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:29,987
~ I love you... ~　　　　 Oh.


773
00:40:30,055 --> 00:40:31,454
Is this Am I


774
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:34,650
How do I look?


775
00:40:34,726 --> 00:40:36,660
Like a new mom.


776
00:40:36,728 --> 00:40:39,720
Scared shitless.


777
00:40:41,699 --> 00:40:44,793
~ Come with me ~


778
00:40:44,869 --> 00:40:48,805
~ My love ~


779
00:40:48,873 --> 00:40:50,807
~ To the sea ~


780
00:40:50,875 --> 00:40:54,208
~ The sea of love ~


781
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:59,216
~ I wanna tell you ~


782
00:40:59,284 --> 00:41:03,380
~ How much... ~


783
00:41:03,455 --> 00:41:05,389
It ended with a chair.


784
00:41:05,457 --> 00:41:10,724
~ ...I love you ~


785
00:41:41,392 --> 00:41:45,385
~ I took the Polaroid down in my room ~


786
00:41:45,463 --> 00:41:49,729
~ I'm pretty sure you have a new girlfriend ~


787
00:41:49,801 --> 00:41:53,567
~ It's not as if I don't like you ~


788
00:41:53,638 --> 00:41:57,734
~ It just makes me sad whenever I see it ~


789
00:41:57,809 --> 00:42:01,768
~ 'Cause I like to be gone most of the time... ~


790
00:42:01,846 --> 00:42:05,907
As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally boss.


791
00:42:05,984 --> 00:42:08,919
He is the cheese to my macaroni.


792
00:42:10,552 --> 00:42:12,047
And I know people are supposed to fall in love


793
00:42:12,123 --> 00:42:13,613
before they reproduce,


794
00:42:13,691 --> 00:42:16,592
but I guess normalcy isn't really our style.


795
00:42:16,661 --> 00:42:18,856
~ ...he didn't want a ride ~


796
00:42:18,930 --> 00:42:22,866
~ And I never met a Toby that I didn't like... ~


797
00:42:22,934 --> 00:42:24,697
Hey.


798
00:42:24,769 --> 00:42:26,703
Hey.


799
00:42:26,771 --> 00:42:29,706
~ ...that I recommended, even if he didn't... ~


800
00:42:29,774 --> 00:42:31,366
Ready?


801
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:32,932
Yeah.


802
00:42:44,389 --> 00:42:46,653
~ You're a parttime lover ~


803
00:42:46,724 --> 00:42:48,658
~ And a fulltime friend ~


804
00:42:48,726 --> 00:42:51,820
~ The monkey on your back is the latest trend ~


805
00:42:51,896 --> 00:42:53,921
~ I don't see what anyone can see ~


806
00:42:53,998 --> 00:42:57,263
~ In anyone else ~


807
00:42:57,335 --> 00:42:58,597
~ But you... ~


808
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,662
~ Here is the church and here is the steeple ~


809
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:05,072
~ We sure are cute for two ugly people ~


810
00:43:05,143 --> 00:43:07,236
~ I don't see what anyone can see ~


811
00:43:07,312 --> 00:43:09,906
~ In anyone else ~


812
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:11,642
~ But you... ~


813
00:43:11,716 --> 00:43:14,651
~ We both have shiny happy fits of rage ~


814
00:43:14,719 --> 00:43:17,984
~ I want more fans, you want more stage ~


815
00:43:18,056 --> 00:43:20,422
~ I don't see what anyone can see ~


816
00:43:20,491 --> 00:43:23,085
~ In anyone else ~


817
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:24,924
~ But you... ~


818
00:43:24,996 --> 00:43:27,931
~ You're always trying to keep it real ~


819
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:31,264
~ And I'm in love with how you feel ~


820
00:43:31,336 --> 00:43:33,861
~ I don't see what anyone can see ~


821
00:43:33,938 --> 00:43:36,873
~ In anyone else ~


822
00:43:36,941 --> 00:43:38,203
~ But you... ~


823
00:43:38,276 --> 00:43:41,211
~ I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train ~


824
00:43:41,279 --> 00:43:42,871
~ I kiss you all starryeyed ~


825
00:43:42,947 --> 00:43:44,778
~ My body swings from side to side ~


826
00:43:44,849 --> 00:43:47,010
~ I don't see what anyone can see ~


827
00:43:47,085 --> 00:43:49,849
~ In anyone else ~


828
00:43:49,921 --> 00:43:51,513
~ But you... ~


829
00:43:51,589 --> 00:43:54,524
~ The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me ~


830
00:43:54,592 --> 00:43:57,857
~ So why can't you forgive me? ~


831
00:43:57,929 --> 00:44:00,363
~ I don't see what anyone can see ~


832
00:44:00,431 --> 00:44:03,525
~ In anyone else ~


833
00:44:03,601 --> 00:44:04,863
~ But you... ~


834
00:44:11,276 --> 00:44:13,710
~ I don't see what anyone can see ~


835
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:16,975
~ In anyone else ~


836
00:44:17,048 --> 00:44:20,040
~ But you. ~


837
00:44:28,974 --> 00:44:40,224


838
00:44:42,774 --> 00:44:45,368
~ Loose lips might sink ships but loose gooses take trips ~


839
00:44:45,443 --> 00:44:47,035
~ To San Francisco double Dutch disco ~


840
00:44:47,111 --> 00:44:48,908
~ Tech TV hottie, do it for Scotty ~


841
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:50,811
~ Do it for the living and do it for the dead ~


842
00:44:50,882 --> 00:44:52,281
~ Do it for the monsters under your bed ~


843
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:53,908
~ Do it for the teenagers and do it for your mom ~


844
00:44:53,985 --> 00:44:55,748
~ Broken hearts hurt but they make us strong and ~


845
00:44:55,820 --> 00:44:58,084
~ We won't stop until somebody calls the cops ~


846
00:44:58,156 --> 00:44:59,748
~ And even then we'll start again ~


847
00:44:59,824 --> 00:45:01,917
~ And just pretend that nothing ever happened ~


848
00:45:01,993 --> 00:45:04,393
~ We won't stop until somebody calls the cops ~


849
00:45:04,462 --> 00:45:06,054
~ And even then we'll start again ~


850
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,223
~ And just pretend that nothing ever happened ~


851
00:45:08,299 --> 00:45:09,891
~ We're just dancing, we're just hugging ~


852
00:45:09,967 --> 00:45:11,559
~ Singing, screaming, kissing, tugging ~


853
00:45:11,636 --> 00:45:13,831
~ On the sleeve of how it used to be ~


854
00:45:13,905 --> 00:45:15,065
~ How's it gonna be? ~


855
00:45:15,139 --> 00:45:16,504
~ I'll drop kick Russell Stover ~


856
00:45:16,574 --> 00:45:18,132
~ Move into the Starting Over house ~


857
00:45:18,209 --> 00:45:20,234
~ You know Matt Rouse and Jest are watching me ~


858
00:45:20,311 --> 00:45:21,642
~ Achieve my dreams ~


859
00:45:21,713 --> 00:45:24,648
~ While we strive to figure out a way we can survive ~


860
00:45:24,716 --> 00:45:27,480
~ These trying times without losing our minds ~


861
00:45:27,552 --> 00:45:29,315
~ Shysters live from scheme to scheme ~


862
00:45:29,387 --> 00:45:31,753
~ But my 4th quarter pipe dreams are seeming more ~


863
00:45:31,823 --> 00:45:33,757
~ And more worth fighting for ~


864
00:45:33,825 --> 00:45:35,759
~ My war paint is Sharpie ink ~


865
00:45:35,827 --> 00:45:37,522
~ And I'll show you how much my shit stinks ~


866
00:45:37,595 --> 00:45:38,994
~ And ask you what you think ~


867
00:45:39,063 --> 00:45:40,860
~ Because your thoughts and words are powerful ~


868
00:45:40,932 --> 00:45:42,524
~ They think we're disposable ~


869
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,192
~ Well both my thumbs opposable ~


870
00:45:44,268 --> 00:45:47,533
~ Spelled out on a double word and triple letter score and ~


871
00:45:47,605 --> 00:45:50,369
~ We won't stop until somebody calls the cops ~


872
00:45:50,441 --> 00:45:52,033
~ And even then we'll start again ~


873
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:54,340
~ And just pretend that nothing ever happened ~


874
00:45:54,412 --> 00:45:57,006
~ We won't stop until somebody calls the cops ~


875
00:45:57,081 --> 00:45:58,673
~ And even then we'll start again ~


876
00:45:58,750 --> 00:46:01,014
~ And just pretend that nothing ever happened ~


877
00:46:01,085 --> 00:46:02,677
~ We're just dancing, we're just hugging ~


878
00:46:02,754 --> 00:46:04,346
~ Singing, screaming, kissing, tugging ~


879
00:46:04,422 --> 00:46:07,289
~ On the sleeve of how it used to be. ~


880
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,804
~ I am a vampire, I am a vampire ~


881
00:46:57,875 --> 00:47:00,139
~ I am a vampire, I am a vampire ~


882
00:47:00,211 --> 00:47:02,679
~ I am a vampire, vampire, I am a vampire ~


883
00:47:02,747 --> 00:47:05,011
~ I have lost my fangs ~


884
00:47:05,082 --> 00:47:07,676
~ I am a vampire, I am a vampire ~


885
00:47:07,752 --> 00:47:09,083
~ I am a vampire ~


886
00:47:09,153 --> 00:47:11,417
~ I have lost my fangs ~


887
00:47:11,489 --> 00:47:13,753
~ So I'm sad and I feel lonely ~


888
00:47:13,825 --> 00:47:16,259
~ So I cry and I'm very angry ~


889
00:47:16,327 --> 00:47:18,761
~ And I ate some garlic ~


890
00:47:18,830 --> 00:47:21,025
~ So I'm no more sad and ache ~


891
00:47:21,098 --> 00:47:22,861
~ Yeah, yeah, I am a vampire ~


892
00:47:22,934 --> 00:47:25,528
~ And I'm looking in the city for the pretty girls ~


893
00:47:25,603 --> 00:47:26,797
~ Don't look at me ~


894
00:47:26,871 --> 00:47:28,065
~ Don't look at me ~


895
00:47:28,139 --> 00:47:30,403
~ 'Cause I don't have my fangs ~


896
00:47:30,475 --> 00:47:33,410
~ 'Cause I have lost my fangs ~


897
00:47:33,478 --> 00:47:36,743
~ I am a vampire, I am a vampire ~


898
00:47:36,814 --> 00:47:39,408
~ I have lost my mouth again ~


899
00:47:39,484 --> 00:47:41,918
~ I am a vampire, I am a vampire ~


900
00:47:41,986 --> 00:47:44,250
~ I have lost my mouth again ~


901
00:47:44,322 --> 00:47:46,586
~ So I get one and I slept ~


902
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:49,091
~ So I eat popcorn and I brood and wait ~


903
00:47:49,160 --> 00:47:51,424
~ And I sing with my best friend the king ~


904
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:54,260
~ And I want to play the guitar ~


905
00:47:54,332 --> 00:47:56,926
~ But my guitar is out of tune ~


906
00:47:57,001 --> 00:47:58,366
~ I am a vampire ~


907
00:47:58,436 --> 00:48:00,267
~ And I'm looking in the city but the musical ~


908
00:48:00,338 --> 00:48:02,101
~ Don't play with me ~


909
00:48:02,173 --> 00:48:03,367
~ Don't play with me ~


910
00:48:03,441 --> 00:48:05,739
~ 'Cause I don't have my mouth again ~


911
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:09,746
~ 'Cause I have lost my mouth again. ~
