00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:37,110
秋天

6
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,470
一切都是从这沙发开始
It started with a chair.

7
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:16,740
我等这刻已久了
I've wanted this for a really long time.

8
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,380
我知道
I know.

9
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:22,730
等等 
Wizard.

10
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:32,570
老天!  巴拿拉  闭上你的狗嘴好吗?
Jeez Banana, shut your freakin' gob OK?

11
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,170
眼前的是我看过最豪华的天然客厅
This is the most magnificent discarded living room set I've ever seen.

12
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,330
哇  你还挺悠然的嘛?
Well, well, if it isn't MacGuff the Crime Dog.

13
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:14,720
又要测吗?
Back for another test?

14
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,040
我认为第一次测试效果不好
I think the first one was defective,

15
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:21,440
阳性指示不清晰  我还是不太相信
The plus sign looks more like a division symbol, so I remain unconvinced.

16
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:27,810
你已经测三次了 "准妈妈" 就是怀孕  别怀疑
Third test today, Momma Bear, your eggo's preggo, no doubt about it.

17
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,770
想知道很容易  你乳头有变深色吗?
It's really easy to tell, is your nipples real brown?

18
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:35,180
或许你男友的"种子" 已经在你肚里生两次根了
Yeah, maybe your little boyfriend's got mutant sperms, knocked you up twice.

19
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:40,550
闭嘴老头!  我一路来喝了两升橙汁  我快要狂喷尿出来了
Silencio, old man. Look, I just drank my weight in SunnyD and I gotta go pronto.

20
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,180
你知道去那里上小号
Well, you know where the lavatory is.

21
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,960
回来再付钱
Pay for that pee stick when you're done.

22
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,600
别以为它沾上了你的尿液  就变成你的了
Don't think it's yours just 'cause you marked it with your urine.

23
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,220
你该不会大吃一惊吧  都是事实了
What's the prognosis, Fertile Myrtle: Minus or plus?

24
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:25,390
谁知道  现在还未显示
I don't know, it's not seasoned yet.

25
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,900
我还要这个
I'll take some of these.

26
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,650
现在  有结果了
There it is.

27
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,450
粉红色的正号标记  真是无法相信
The little pink plus sign is so unholy.

28
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:44,250
我不明白你费什么劲  反正都是无法改变的
That ain't no Etch- a- Sketch, this is one doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet.

29
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,090
我想要自杀了
I'm a suicide risk.

30
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:11,390
是朱诺吗?
Juno?

31
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,220
不  我是摩根・弗里曼  你有藏起人骨吗?(指电影情节)
No, it's Morgan Freeman, do you have any bones that need collecting?

32
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:17,530
我裤兜有根  你怎么了?
Only the one in my pants.

33
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,130
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

34
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,140
什么?  你说真的?
What? Honest to blog?

35
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:24,160
对  是里克的种
Yeah, it's Bleeker's.

36
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:27,780
或许是食物宝宝  你中饭有吃很多吗?
It's probably just a food baby, did you have a big lunch?

37
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:33,530
不是食物宝宝  我做了三次测试  十分肯定
This is not a food baby, I've taken three pregnancy tests and I am fo' shiz up the spout.

38
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:39,440
你一天内怎做到三次的?  太不可置信了
How did you even generate enough pee for three pregnancy tests? That's amazing.

39
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:43,300
我不知道  反正我是喝了10吨的果汁
I don't know, I drank like ten tons of SunnyD.

40
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,860
我说我怀孕了  你却表现得毫不惊讶
I'm telling you I'm pregnant and you're acting shockingly cavalier.

41
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,340
真的?  是真实的真吗?
Is this for real? Like for real for real?

42
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:52,420
很不幸  是的
Unfortunately yes.

43
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,050
噢!  我的天啊!
Oh, my God!

44
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,090
噢!  该死!  去他的!
Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!

45
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:03,110
这才是我一开始就期待的反应
That was kind of the emotion that I was searching for on the first take.

46
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:05,660
你打算去"布克天堂"或"真女人"(堕胎机构)吗?
Are you going to Havenbrook or Women Now?

47
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:08,300
去"布克天堂"要父母签字才可以
You need a note from your parents for Havenbrook.

48
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:13,230
我打算去"真女人"  因为他们帮的都是真女人
Yeah, I know. No, I'm going to go to Women Now, just 'cause they help out women now.

49
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:15,940
要我帮你预约吗?  我去年就帮过碧奇
Do you want me to call for you? Because I called for Becky last year.

50
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:17,280
不用了  我自己可以
No, I can call myself.

51
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,140
不过有件更重要的事情需要你帮忙
Oh, but I do need your help with something, it's like critically important.

52
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,140
知道吗  这份上我倒是  帮忙干重活的好帮手
You know, heavy lifting can really only help you at this point.

53
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:26,830
真的假的?
Seriously.

54
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,440
你是无聊才想要的(怀孕)吗?
So, you were bored? That's how this blessed miracle came to be?

55
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:35,030
我们计划好的  我是说做爱  怀孕不在计划内
No, the act was premeditated. I mean, the sex, not the whole "let's get pregnant" thing.

56
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:40,480
你什么时候决定搭上里克的?
So, when did you decide that you were gonna do Bleeker?

57
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:42,560
不清楚
I don't know.

58
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:46,880
一年前的西班牙语课上
A year ago in Spanish class.

59
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,170
你喜欢他
You love him.

60
00:08:52,890 --> 00:08:56,100
不是这样  其实蛮复杂 
It's actually really complicated, OK?

61
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:00,400
而我不太想在现在情况下说
And I don't feel like talking about it in my fragile state.

62
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:02,700
和他干感觉如何?
So what was it like?

63
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:04,870
像抱着根树干?
Humping Bleek's bony bod?

64
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,200
激昂澎湃吧
Magnificent.

65
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:46,330
好吗  里克
Hey, Bleek.

66
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:49,710
好猛的老虎
Wicked tiger.

67
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,550
衬起你很有贵气
It looks proud.

68
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:54,330
我从莎伦阿姨那顺手牵羊来的
I swiped it from Ms. Rancick's lawn.

69
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:59,080
为何  你的衬衫今天特别金黄
Wow, your shorts are like especially gold today.

70
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:01,220
我老妈说亮颜色能让人精神点
My mom uses color- safe bleach.

71
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,910
跟她说很好
Go Carole.

72
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:05,240
我会跟她说
I'll tell her.

73
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:13,000
每当我看到他们一路跑  一路摇着自己的"东西"
When I see them all running like that, with their things bouncing around in their shorts,

74
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,560
我总幻想他们裸体的样子  尽管我不太喜欢看到那"东西"
I always picture them naked, even if I don't want to, all I see is pork swords.

75
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:20,420
我想我该一起跑了
I'm supposed to be running.

76
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,750
给你猜点东西
So guess what.

77
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,310
什么?  我不知道
What? I don't know.

78
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:28,380
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

79
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,170
我们要怎么做?
What should we do?

80
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:49,950
你明白  我只想在事情闹大前快点了事
Oh, you know, I was thinking I'd just nip it in the bud before it gets worse.

81
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,060
因为课堂上也有学过怀孕是什么
Because they were talking about it in health class,

82
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:56,300
还有会导致个婴儿出世
how pregnancy can often lead to an infant.

83
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:57,920
对  很对
Typically, yeah, yeah.

84
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,690
就好象我们妈妈  老师怀孕时候一样
That's what happens when our moms and teachers get pregnant.

85
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,720
你接受得了吗?
So, you're cool with that then?

86
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:10,390
是的  当然  你知道 
Yeah, yeah, wizard. You know,

87
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:13,310
我想你就按自己想法去做吧
do whatever you think you should do, you know?

88
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:20,090
哦  抱歉把你搞上床了
Well, I'm sorry I had sex with you,

89
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:22,940
那不是你想的
I know it wasn't your idea.

90
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:26,230
什么  是谁想的?
Whose idea was it?

91
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,170
我们学校再见  好吧?!
I'll see you at school, alright?

92
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,390
那是谁的主意?
Whose idea was it?

93
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:01,820
你的书都烂成一堆了
Hey, your book fell apart.

94
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,660
为什么会这样?
Right.

95
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:05,300
物似主人形吧
It must have looked at your face.

96
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:11,230
有趣的是史迪夫暗恋我
The funny thing is that Steve Rendazo secretly wants me.

97
00:12:11,860 --> 00:12:13,820
因为他们喜欢那些不入流的女孩子
Jocks like him always want freaky girls.

98
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,610
那些戴黑框眼镜  穿老土裤子和奇怪装扮的女孩
Girls with horn- rimmed glasses and vegan footwear and Goth makeup.

99
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,470
然后会拉大提琴  看无聊杂志
Girls who play the cello and read McSweeney's and

100
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,300
长大后成为图书管理员的女孩
want to be children's librarians when they grow up.

101
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:28,320
对的  他们就喜欢那路货色
Oh yeah, jocks totally eat that shit up.

102
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,320
尽管他们不肯承认
They just won't admit it, because they're

103
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,880
因为他们本应追求完美的拉拉队长
supposed to be into perfect cheerleaders you know,

104
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,710
就如莉亚  不经意就招老师们喜欢
Like Leah, who incidentally is into teachers.

105
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:38,230
我也是啊  我很喜欢伍迪・艾伦
Me too, I love Woody Allen!

106
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,050
好了  同学们!
Alright people.

107
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,670
今天我们做光磁学实验
We're doing chromatography lab today, so find

108
00:12:46,670 --> 00:12:48,820
四个人为一组
your partners and break into groups of four.

109
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,490
看上去一点也不像是要做实验
Well, there's nothing like experimenting.

110
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:00,630
我昨晚做了预习的问题
I did the prep questions for this lab last night,

111
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,430
你可以抄我的答案
so you can just copy my answers if you want.

112
00:13:02,790 --> 00:13:03,690
我不可以抄你答案
I couldn't copy your work.

113
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:05,660
你每周都抄我的啊
You copy my work every week.

114
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,160
那倒是真的  我是个没有贡献的组员是吗?
True, I'm kind of a deadbeat lab partner, aren't I?

115
00:13:08,570 --> 00:13:10,440
当然不  不要介意  我肯定你为小组做出过贡献
No, no, I don't mind. I think you definitely bring something to the table.

116
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:11,660
某些方面
Charisma.

117
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:16,190
好了  大家都准备好做实验了?
Who's ready for some chromamagnificence?

118
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,620
我"大姨妈"来了头很痛  恐怕今天脑袋不太灵光
I have a menstrual migraine, so I can't really look at bright lights today.

119
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:23,540
我都叫你去医务室休息了  你就是不肯听
Amanda, I told you to go to the infirmary and lie down. You never listen.

120
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:27,680
才不呢  左治  我可不是个听人摆布的机器人
No, Josh, because I don't take orders. Not from you and not from any man.

121
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,600
自我去看望我哥后
You know, you've been acting like this ever since

122
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,000
你就一直这样子
I got back from visiting my brother in Mankato.

123
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,100
我都说了  什么事也没发生
I already told you, nothing happened.

124
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,040
我先放置好仪器
Well, I'm gonna set up the apparatus.

125
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,800
朱诺  你可以放这些进去吗?
Juno, do you want to plug in the Bunsen burner?

126
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,220
很乐意
It's my pleasure.

127
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,250
我这就去医务室
I'm going to the infirmary.

128
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,570
很好  你"大姨妈"走了再叫我
Good. Call me when you get off the rag.

129
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,490
那好  当你学会了怎么
Fine, call me when you learn how to love someone,

130
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,050
爱一个人再打给我
instead of cheating at your brother's college,

131
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,220
学你哥那样会撒谎
Just because you've had four Smirnoff Ices and

132
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,080
喝了一瓶冰桃味波本威士忌不认帐
a bottle of Snow Peak Peach flavored Boone's!

133
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,800
好的阿曼达  我一定会的  我会记下来的
Good, Amanda, I'll be sure to do that, I'll make a note of it.

134
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,270
我听说冰桃味是波本威士忌中最好的
I've actually heard that the Snow Peak Peach flavor is the best flavor of Boone's.

135
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:02,680
是吗?
Isn't that right, Bleek?

136
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,030
(怀孕了?  找真女人)

137
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:19,380
按你想要的服务
Oprimo numero dos.

138
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:28,600
你好  对  我想做人流手术
Yeah, I'm just calling to procure a hasty abortion.

139
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,460
什么?
What?

140
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,640
你可以等等吗  我弄弄我的(汉堡包)电话
Can you just hold on for a second, I'm on my hamburger phone.

141
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,110
好了  可以了
Okay, now I can,

142
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,680
对  已经深思熟虑了
Yeah, it's really awkward to talk on.

143
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,140
对的  我要做个人流
Yeah, I need an abortion.

144
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:50,640
16岁
Sixteen.

145
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,690
从发生关系后有2个月零4天了
I'm gonna say it's been about two months and four days since the sex,

146
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,420
或者有偏差 只是估计的
Mind you, that's just like a guestimation.

147
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,130
抱歉  我多久什么?
Sorry, how long have I been what?

148
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:07,610
噢  我很讨厌人们说"性生活"这词
Oh, I hate it when adults use the term "sexually active".

149
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,420
要怎么理解?
What does it even mean?

150
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:12,940
难道是某天要履行的  固定一种行为吗?!
Can I deactivate someday, or is this a permanent state of being?

151
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,200
我觉得那天晚上里克非常享受
I guess Bleeker went live that night we did it,

152
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,940
不是处男不会有那表情 
I guess that's why he got that look on his face.

153
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,510
你真该去看看那个炉子
You should have seen this octopus furnace at work.

154
00:15:21,510 --> 00:15:24,890
要穿上防护衣才能进去
I had to get out my Hazmat suit just to get into the thing.

155
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,560
我爸爸是退役军人  不过现在是H-vac的维修技工
My dad used to be in the Army, but now he's just your average HVAC specialist.

156
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:31,460
在我5岁时 他和我妈离了婚 
He and my mom got divorced when I was five,

157
00:15:31,810 --> 00:15:33,530
我妈和她新老公在阿拉桑娜州定居
She lives on a Havasu reservation in Arizona

158
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:35,390
还有三个代替我的孩子
with her new husband and three replacement kids.

159
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,990
还有她每年情人节都寄仙人掌给我
Oh, and she inexplicably mails me a cactus every Valentine's Day.

160
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:41,320
然后我会回谢她说
And I'm like, Thanks a heap, Coyote Ugly.

161
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:44,120
"比起这些仙人掌  被你抛弃的感受还不错"
This cactus- gram stings even worse than your abandonment.

162
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:49,050
这是我后妈布伦  她可是爱狗一族
That's my stepmom, Bren, she's completely obsessed with dogs.

163
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:53,120
她有间美容修甲沙龙  里面总有股药水味道
Owns a nail salon and always smells like methylmethacrylate.

164
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,200
朱诺 昨晚的搬运工作如何?
So Juno, how was your little maneuver last night?

165
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,250
你指什么?
Which maneuver, sir?

166
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,610
是指把客厅家具搬到另一处 
The one where I moved an entire living room set from one lawn to the other,

167
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:04,850
还是指我干掉了64盎司的蓝色饮料
or the one where I downed a sixty- four ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?

168
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,050
朱诺  你对我的瓷缸做过什么吗?
Juno, did you by any chance barf in my urn?

169
00:16:11,730 --> 00:16:14,250
麦克  你知道就是那个  我放在门廊里放水的缸
Mac, you know that nice urn by the front door, the one I got up in Stillwater?

170
00:16:15,190 --> 00:16:16,360
早上我发现那里面
There was some blue shit,

171
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,010
有些很脏的蓝色呕吐物
I mean, gunk, stuff in there this morning.

172
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,560
我从没朝那里面呕吐过
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda.

173
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:26,840
我是说  或许是小玛丽吐的
I mean, maybe L.B. did it.

174
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,510
玛丽・比 如果你还把豆放上去
Liberty Bell, if you put one more Baco on that potato,

175
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:33,010
我就要狠狠打你个小屁股了
I'm gonna kick your little monkey butt.

176
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:40,370
每个小宝宝都想来这世界  每个小宝宝都想来这世界
All babies want to get borned! All babies want to get borned!

177
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,060
每个小宝宝都想来这世界 
All babies want to get borned!

178
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:46,950
嘿  苏春
Hey Su- Chin.

179
00:16:47,830 --> 00:16:48,860
你好  朱诺
Hi, Juno.

180
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,440
你好吗?
How are you?

181
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,020
不错  很好
You know, pretty solid.

182
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,050
你完成课堂布置的作业了?
So did you write that paper for Worth's class yet?

183
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,810
不  还没呢
No, not yet.

184
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,090
我昨晚想过做了  不过有点精神不集中
I tried to work on it a little last night, but I'm having trouble concentrating.

185
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,170
如果你需要可以吃点安非他明
I'll sell you some of my Adderall.

186
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,580
不了  谢谢  我不嗑药
No thanks, I'm off pills.

187
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:11,170
这个选择不错  你知道我认识个女孩 
That's a wise choice 'cause I knew this girl, she had this crazy freakout.

188
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:16,160
她嗑了很多安非他明  然后脱光衣服
She took too many behavioral meds at once and she ripped off her clothes

189
00:17:16,590 --> 00:17:22,530
跑进大商场  大叫着说 "我是大海来的女妖"
and dove into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall like, Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!

190
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,440
那是你吗?
I heard that was you.

191
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:30,120
真高兴见到你  苏春
It was good seeing you, Su- Chin.

192
00:17:33,610 --> 00:17:35,720
你的宝宝现在可能心跳加速  知道吗?
Your baby probably has a beating heart, you know?

193
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:37,880
它会感觉到痛了
It can feel pain,

194
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:40,470
还有  指甲了
And it has fingernails.

195
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:44,760
手指甲?  真的?
Fingernails? Really?

196
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:04,440
欢迎来"真女人"  我们是你值得信任的朋友
Welcome to Women Now, where women are trusted friends.

197
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:07,480
请把手抬起来  放到柜台前
Please put your hands where I can see them and surrender any bombs.

198
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,310
嘿  我是来表演大魔术的!
Hey, I'm here for the big show.

199
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,430
名字!
Your name, please?

200
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,710
朱诺・麦高夫
Juno MacGuff.

201
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:17,300
她认为我用的是个假名  
She thinks I'm using a fake name.

202
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,110
比如"让・斯蒂沃德"或"德兰修女"
Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.

203
00:18:22,450 --> 00:18:24,860
我需要你把两面都填了
I need you to fill these out, both sides.

204
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:27,780
还有任何细节任何来源
We need to know about every score and every sore.

205
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,140
要免费的套吗?
Would you like a free condom?

206
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:33,810
是草莓味的
They're boysenberry.

207
00:18:34,610 --> 00:18:35,960
不了 我现在对性冷淡
No, I'm off sex.

208
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,420
我男友每次和我做爱都用
My boyfriend uses them every time we have intercourse.

209
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,950
他下体闻起来就像块蛋糕派
They make his jocks smell like pie.

210
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:21,480
每个小宝宝都想来这世界  每个小宝宝都想来这世界
All babies want to get borned! All babies want to get borned!

211
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:24,800
上帝会感谢你的奇迹!
God appreciates your miracle!

212
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,110
伙计  你来这里干嘛呢?
Dude, what are you doing here?

213
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:29,720
我以为四点才去接你
I'm supposed to come get you at four.

214
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:30,940
我做不到
I couldn't do it, Leah!

215
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:34,340
那里总感觉有个牙科诊室 
It smelled like a dentist office in there,

216
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:36,450
杂志沾满恶心的水渍
And there were these horrible magazines with water stains.

217
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,120
还有那个柜台小妞不断
And then the friggin' receptionist is trying to

218
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,590
推销像超级奶嘴般的免费安全套
give me these condoms that looked like grape suckers,

219
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,470
然后吹嘘自己男友的蛋蛋像块蛋糕派
and just babbling away about her friggin' boyfriend's pie balls.

220
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,550
不错
Yum!

221
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,750
苏春也在那
And Su- Chin was there, and she was

222
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,090
然后说"嗨  宝宝有指甲"
like, "Oh hi! Babies have fingernails. "

223
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,300
指甲啊!
Fingernails!

224
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:53,550
那可真怪异
That's gruesome.

225
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,220
你有想过宝宝会挖破肚皮出来?
You think the baby can scratch your vag on the way out?

226
00:19:57,810 --> 00:19:59,150
莉亚  我在怀孕呢!
I'm staying pregnant, Leah.

227
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,600
姐妹  不要那么大声  我妈妈在里面
Dude! You gotta keep your voice down, my mom is inside.

228
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,920
她还不知道我们已经有性生活了
She doesn't know that we're sexually active.

229
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,390
那又说明什么了?
What does that even mean?

230
00:20:07,420 --> 00:20:09,090
我有想过 
I've been thinking.

231
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:12,950
让宝宝出生  然后送给需要它的人
I was thinking that I could have this baby and give it to someone who totally needs it.

232
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:15,750
比如无法生育的妇女  或者善良的女同性恋
You know, like a woman with a bum ovary or a couple of nice lesbos.

233
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:19,320
不过你会变得很胖  胸部渗出乳汁
But then you're gonna get huge and your chest is gonna milktate.

234
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:23,340
并且你必须告诉别人你怀孕了
And you have to tell people that you're pregnant.

235
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:25,560
或许人们会赞许我的无私
But maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.

236
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,670
或许给脸色你看且对你不善
Maybe they'll totally shit and be really mad and

237
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:31,670
不让你毕业  或不让你去卡波春游
not let you graduate or go to Cabo for spring break.

238
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,620
我和里克计划去其他地方
I was going to go to Gettysburg with Bleeker anyway.

239
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,430
你应该看看收养信息
You should look at adoption ads,

240
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,230
我在《Penny Saver》经常看到(免费邮购周刊)
I see them all the time in the Penny Saver.

241
00:20:41,370 --> 00:20:42,900
有推销父母的广告?
They have ads for parents?

242
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,150
对
Yeah!

243
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:50,550
就好像推销其他货品的广告一样
Desperately Seeking Spawn.Right next to terriers and iguanas and used fitness equipment.

244
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:51,850
是完全合法的
It's totally legit.

245
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,850
家庭美满  彼此恩爱的夫妇
"Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple have found true love with each other. "

246
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:02,840
就差自己的孩子
"All that's missing is your bastard. "

247
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:04,750
我想要只鹦鹉
I want a parakeet.

248
00:21:05,310 --> 00:21:06,810
朱诺  你根本没在听我说
You're totally not even listening to me.

249
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:10,070
我不太想把宝宝送给
No, I heard you. I don't want to give the baby

250
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,070
那些自称美满的家庭
to a family that describes themselves as "wholesome. "

251
00:21:12,430 --> 00:21:14,590
-为什么?  -我想要比较活跃点的父母
- Why? - I want something a little more edgier.

252
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,450
-那你理想类型是什么?  -平面造型设计师不错
- Okay, what did you have in mind exactly? - I was thinking a graphic designer,

253
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:20,770
30岁左右
mid- thirties,

254
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:24,470
老婆是亚裔人  穿着得体而且会弹吉他
with a cool Asian girlfriend who dresses awesome and rocks out on the bass guitar.

255
00:21:25,090 --> 00:21:26,540
不过不要过于与众不同的
But I don't want to be too particular.

256
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,880
好  这对怎么样?
OK, how about this?

257
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:34,210
受过高等教育事业成功的年轻夫妇  加入他们的五人家庭  
"Educated, successful couple seeking infant to join our family of five."

258
00:21:34,570 --> 00:21:38,700
会有报酬  请帮助我们完成爱的轮回
"You will be compensated. Help us complete the circle of love. "

259
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:40,450
听起来不错
That sounds great.

260
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:43,710
比较像宗买卖  而且他们已有三个孩子
They sound like a friggin' cult. Besides, they already have three kids,

261
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,510
听起来他们是贪心的混蛋
they're greedy little bitches.

262
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:47,680
噢  朱诺  这对怎么样?
Oh, Juno! How about this one?

263
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:53,270
他们是马克和瓦内萨・罗琳
They were Mark and Vanessa Loring,

264
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,590
一张很漂亮的黑白照
And they were beautiful even in black and white.

265
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,820
嘿  孩子  要下楼吃东西吗?
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?

266
00:22:09,270 --> 00:22:10,370
我想不用了
No, I don't think so.

267
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,620
你今天跑了8公里  宝贝
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.

268
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:15,210
我肚子还未饿
I'm not hungry, oddly.

269
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:17,550
是早餐加晚餐  你最喜欢的搭配
But it's breakfast for supper. It's your favorite, Paul.

270
00:22:18,790 --> 00:22:19,630
好
Yeah.

271
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,920
今天你去跑步的时候  朱诺・麦高夫电话你了
Juno MacGuff called while you were out running today.

272
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,940
你知道我对她的看法
You know how I feel about her.

273
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,060
是的  你跟我说过很多次
You've mentioned it a couple times.

274
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:31,650
她比较  
She is just...

275
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:33,590
与众不同
...different.

276
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,870
对
Yeah.

277
00:23:02,570 --> 00:23:04,600
我不知道从何说起  
I'm not really sure how I'm gonna spit this out.

278
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:06,310
你是怎么被开除的?
Hon, did you get expelled?

279
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:10,670
不是  如果我被开除学校会先联系你们
No. The school would most likely contact you in the event of my expulsion.

280
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:13,230
我只是问问  看上去有这可能
Well, I was just asking. It seemed plausible.

281
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,180
你想要大笔钱吗?  还是律师?
Do you need a large amount of money? Legal counsel?

282
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,520
我不需要什么
No, I'm not asking for anything.

283
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:23,200
除了宽容  没人因此而揍我就最好
Except for maybe mercy. Like, it would be friggin' sweet if no one hit me.

284
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,590
你做了什么?  用车子撞人了?
What have you done, Junebug? Did you hit someone with the Previa?

285
00:23:26,040 --> 00:23:26,730
不是
No.

286
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,820
姐妹  我认为还是直接说好点
Dude, I think it's best to just tell them.

287
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,410
我怀孕了
I'm pregnant.

288
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:39,800
噢  上帝啊!
Oh, God.

289
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,390
我已经放弃堕胎了
But I'm going to give it up for adoption.

290
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,910
我找到了一对不错的夫妇  
I already found the perfect couple.

291
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,460
他们会付医药和所有的费用
They're gonna pay for the medical expenses and everything.

292
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:51,710
然后30周后就可以当什么事也没发生过
In thirty- odd weeks we can just pretend that this never happened.

293
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:55,070
你有宝宝了?
You're pregnant?

294
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:56,440
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

295
00:23:56,970 --> 00:24:00,400
但我这就是我得到的安慰  
I'm sorry. And if it is any consolation,

296
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,410
我心口和膝盖都感到火辣辣的痛
I have heartburn that's radiating down to my kneecaps

297
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,080
我从周三开始就没拉过屎了
and I haven't take a dump since Wednesday.

298
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,180
从周三早上
Morning!

299
00:24:08,610 --> 00:24:09,920
我们不知道你已经有性生活了
I didn't even know you were sexually active!

300
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,290
那孩子长什么样?
Who is the kid?

301
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:16,750
我还不太清楚  你知道  大概有指甲了
The baby? I don't really know much about it. It has fingernails, allegedly.

302
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:18,650
指甲?  真的?
Nails? Really?

303
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:19,730
对
Yeah.

304
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,930
我是说孩子的父亲是谁?  朱诺
I mean, who is the father, Juno?

305
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:27,320
是保利・里克
It's Paulie Bleeker.

306
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:29,510
保利・里克?
Paulie Bleeker?

307
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,090
怎么了?
What?

308
00:24:33,150 --> 00:24:34,370
我以为他没生育能力呢
I didn't think he had it in him!

309
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:35,750
我明白
I know, right?

310
00:24:37,070 --> 00:24:38,510
这不是件好笑的事情
Right, this is no laughing matter.

311
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:39,890
当然不是
No, it's not.

312
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,590
保利事实上做的很棒  
And Paulie is actually great.

313
00:24:43,830 --> 00:24:44,390
在椅子上
In chair.

314
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:47,590
你想过给人收养吗?
You were thinking about adoption?

315
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:50,310
对  有对夫妇不能生育  
Yeah, there's this couple.

316
00:24:50,310 --> 00:24:54,540
你必须知道  他们已经努力了5年
They've been trying to have a kid for five years.

317
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:56,950
是我在《Penny Saver》杂志看到的
We found them in the Penny Saver next to the exotic birds.

318
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,930
他们有律师了  而我们约好下周末见面
They have a legitimate lawyer and I was going to go meet with them next weekend.

319
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,940
朱诺  这是件很难决定
Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do.

320
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:07,790
并超过你能理解的事情
Probably tougher than you can understand right now.

321
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,370
我明白  
I know...

322
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,430
只是我还没准备好做个妈妈
...It's just that I'm not ready to be a mom.

323
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,090
见鬼  你当然还没
Damn skippy, you're not!

324
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,950
你甚至都记不得给妹妹吃哮喘药
You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds.

325
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:22,620
就一次而已  而且想想至少她并没死掉
That was once! And she did not die, if you recall!

326
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:27,540
亲爱的  你有想过其他选择吗?
Honey, had you considered, you know, the alternative?

327
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,370
没有
No.

328
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:31,710
你可真是勇敢无比啊
Well, you're a little Viking!

329
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:34,810
先做首要的事
First things first,

330
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:36,660
要让你保持健康
we have to get you healthy.

331
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:37,850
你需要吃孕妇维他命
You need prenatal vitamins,

332
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,070
而且它对你的指甲也很有好处
Incidentally, they do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus.

333
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:44,460
还有约个医生检查
Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment.

334
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,980
看看你什么时候生产
Figure out where you're going to deliver.

335
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,180
我要和你去见那对夫妇
Juno, I'm coming with you to meet this adoption people.

336
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:53,620
你还是个小孩子  我不想宝宝被不好的人收养
You're just a kid. I don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts.

337
00:25:54,650 --> 00:25:55,520
谢谢  爸爸
Thanks, Dad.

338
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,740
我还以为你是个懂事的孩子
I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.

339
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,380
我真不清楚自己是个怎样的女孩子
I don't really know what kind of girl I am.

340
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,550
跟我说实话  是我的过失吗?
Tell it to me straight, Bren. Do you think this is my fault?

341
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:26,340
小孩如果无所事事  就会发生这样的事情
I think kids get bored and have intercourse.

342
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:29,760
而且朱朱对此也没有自控力
And I think Junebug was a dummy about it, Mac.

343
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,260
我还没准备好当个爷爷
I am not ready to be a Pop- Pop.

344
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,800
你不会当个爷爷
You're not going to be a Pop- Pop.

345
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:36,330
有人会在这个烂摊子上
Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing

346
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:38,430
得到上帝的祝福
from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation.

347
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,040
当她站在我们面前时  你就料到这件事了吗?
Did you see that coming when she sat us down here?

348
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,910
对  不过我倒希望是被学校开除了  或者是嗑药之类
Yeah. But I was hoping she was expelled or into hard drugs.

349
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,940
我也这样想  酒后驾车什么的  可没想到会是这样
That was my first instinct too. Or D.W.I. Anything but this.

350
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:53,680
下次我看到里克  我要狠狠教训他
And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid in the weiner the next time I see him.

351
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:56,970
麦克  你知道这不是他想的
Mac, no. You know it wasn't his idea.

352
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:07,990
你好  我是瓦内萨  两位是朱诺和麦高夫先生
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must be Juno and Mr. MacGuff.

353
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,820
瓦内萨・罗琳
Vanessa.

354
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,280
你是瓦内萨本人对吗?
It's Vanessa, right?

355
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,190
谢谢招待我和我这个不俏女
Thanks for having me and my irresponsible child over to your house.

356
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,710
不  得谢谢你们
Oh no. Thank you.

357
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:17,980
谢谢

358
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,380
请进吧
Come on in.

359
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,010
要我帮你拿下外衣和帽子吗?
Can I take your coat or your hat?

360
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:23,460
噢  好的  谢谢
Oh, yeah, sure, thanks.

361
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,940
你们在杂志的照片很真实
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver, by the way. Super classy.

362
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:29,650
不像其他人假树林作背景的照片
Not like those people with fake woods in the background,

363
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:31,880
说实话  那用来唬弄谁啊?!
Honestly, who do they think they're fooling?

364
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:33,810
你在《Penny Saver》上看到我们的?
You found us in the Penny Saver?

365
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:36,060
你好  我是她丈夫马克・罗琳
Hi. Mark Loring. I'm the husband.

366
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:38,540
-你好吗?  我是麦克・麦高夫  -很高兴认识你
- How you doing? Mac McGuff. - Nice to meet you.

367
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:40,420
你好
Hi.

368
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,540
她是吉托・拉斯  我们代表律师
This is Gerta Rauss, our attorney.

369
00:28:42,900 --> 00:28:44,800
吉托・拉斯
Gerta Rauss.

370
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:46,990
你好  很高兴认识你
Hi, pleased to meet you.

371
00:28:48,740 --> 00:28:50,210
当然了  她就是朱诺
And this, of course, is Juno.

372
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:52,730
听起来像阿拉斯加的小城市
Like the city in Alaska.

373
00:28:53,190 --> 00:28:53,780
不
No.

374
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:55,150
不是吗?
No?

375
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,430
好
Hon?

376
00:28:56,980 --> 00:28:58,370
亲爱的  你不要坐吗?
Shall we sit down and get to know one another?

377
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,870
我打算拿点喝的
I thought I'd get some drinks.

378
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:04,270
喝点什么?  有苏打水  维他矿泉水和橙汁
What would anyone like? I have Pellegrino or Vitamin Water or orange juice.

379
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:06,740
来杯波本威士忌  谢谢
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.

380
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,620
她有点  
She's kidding.

381
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,770
她有点小幽默感  是她的天赋之一
Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor, just one of her many genetic gifts.

382
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:14,870
我坐好了
I see.

383
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:21,400
那么  朱诺  你进展到什么阶段了?
So, Juno. First off, how far along are you?

384
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:22,690
我在读高中
I'm a junior.

385
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,740
我意思是指怀孕
No, I mean in your pregnancy.

386
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:30,240
我的后妈昨天带我检查
Oh. Uh, actually my stepmom took me yesterday

387
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:32,540
医生说有三个月了
to the doctor and they said I was twelve weeks.

388
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:33,930
不错啊
Oh, that's marvelous.

389
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,040
所以你在读第二学期(美国高中三学期制  一个学期三个月)
So you're into your second trimester?

390
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:39,910
对  很明显
Yeah, apparently.

391
00:29:40,660 --> 00:29:42,010
我上了五个月了
I'm due on May 4.

392
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,010
很好
Great.

393
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,560
我朋友说(怀孕)头两三个月是最辛苦的
My girlfriends tell me the first couple months are the hardest.

394
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,380
我自己没多大感觉
I didn't notice it at all.

395
00:29:47,650 --> 00:29:53,960
我比较关心的是  要在牛仔裤外头穿件松紧裤
I'm more concerned about when they have to put that elastic band in the front of my jeans.

396
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:56,430
我想怀孕是件美不可言的事
I think pregnancy is beautiful.

397
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:58,720
你该庆幸自己没怀孕
Well, you're lucky it's not you.

398
00:30:02,350 --> 00:30:05,000
我们谈谈怎么处理这个  
So, let's talk how we're gonna do this... thing.

399
00:30:05,510 --> 00:30:07,540
谈什么?  把它挤出来  
Well, don't I just have the thing?

400
00:30:07,850 --> 00:30:09,720
然后递给你就行
Squeeze it on out and hand it over?

401
00:30:10,770 --> 00:30:13,820
马克和瓦内萨商议过了  决定采取公开收养的方式
Mark and Vanessa are willing to negotiate an open adoption.

402
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,300
那是什么意思?
What does that mean?

403
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:18,380
就是收养后定期给你们反馈  比如宝宝照片
It means they'd send annual updates, photos,

404
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:21,850
让你们了解宝宝成长过程
let Juno know how the baby is doing as he or she grows up.

405
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:26,240
不要  我不想看到  任何照片反馈什么
Whoah. I don't want photos or any kind of notification.

406
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,680
我意思是不能按老一套方法做吗?
Can't we just kick this old school?

407
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,670
把宝宝放在篮子
I stick the baby in a basket and send it your way.

408
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:34,190
就像芦苇丛里的摩西
Like Moses in the reeds.

409
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:37,000
那是旧约《圣经》里的做法
Technically, that would be kickin' it Old Testament.

410
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:40,020
对  说的对
Exactly! Right?

411
00:30:40,430 --> 00:30:41,210
你明白我意思
Do you know what I mean?

412
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:43,600
就像古时做法  快捷又省事
Like in the good old days. When it was quick and dirty.

413
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,600
好吧  大家都同意采用传统收养方式
Well, then we all agree a traditional closed adoption would be best for all involved?

414
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,960
我靠  就这样  秘密收养
Shit, yes, just close her on up.

415
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:57,160
我们会补偿你一切医疗费用
Obviously, we would compensate you for all your medical expenses.

416
00:30:58,160 --> 00:31:00,320
还需要我们其它方面的补偿吗?
Are you looking for any other type of compensation?

417
00:31:02,530 --> 00:31:03,330
你说什么?
Excuse me?

418
00:31:07,150 --> 00:31:07,880
不
No.

419
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,530
不  我又不是在出售"东西"
No, I don't want to sell the thing, I just...

420
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:12,550
我只想
I want...

421
00:31:14,770 --> 00:31:18,500
我只想这个宝宝有人愿意爱它
I just want the baby to be with people who are gonna love it,

422
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:21,250
有对爱它的父母  好吗?
And be good parents, you know?

423
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,750
我只是个高中女生
I'm in high school.

424
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:28,310
伙计  我还没有准备好呢
I'm ill- equipped.

425
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:33,630
你正做着一件最美妙  最无私的事
You're doing a beautiful and a selfless thing for us.

426
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:36,310
瓦内萨从结婚开始就一直想做个妈妈
Vanessa has wanted a baby ever since we got married.

427
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,880
我太想要个孩子了
I want to be a mommy so badly!

428
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:40,250
看得出来
You don't say.

429
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:42,920
你不觉得人生下来就有其使命吗?
Have you ever felt like you were just born to do something?

430
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:44,560
对
Yes.

431
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:45,990
我就是为修空调而生的
Heating and air conditioning.

432
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:47,530
你说的没错
There you go.

433
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:49,700
我的天职就是做个母亲
I was born to be a mother.

434
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:51,250
这是我相信的
Some of us are.

435
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:55,850
你怎么样马克?  你天生就做个父亲吗?
How about you, Mark, are you looking forward to being a dad?

436
00:31:57,050 --> 00:31:57,890
那是  当然
Betcha, yeah.

437
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:02,750
全世界男人都想当个父亲  做足球队教练  
Every guy wants to be a father. Wants to coach the soccer team and

438
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:06,730
或者做一些科学工程研究  比如火山爆发  之类的
help out with the science fair and the volcano goes off.

439
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:08,990
太多了
Yeah, all that.

440
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:14,300
或者给你们看看起草好的协议吧
Maybe Gerta could take us through the preliminary documents that you have drawn up.

441
00:32:14,860 --> 00:32:20,940
好的  但是能不能用下洗手间  怀孕让我总想去尿尿
Could I use the facilities first? Being pregnant makes me pee like Seabiscuit.

442
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:27,110
当然  楼下的卫生间改掉了  你可以用楼上房间里的  
The downstairs bathroom is being re- tiled, but if you go upstairs, then to the right...

443
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:28,800
有马桶的房间  明白
Oh yeah! Room with the toilet.

444
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:31,110
她还好吧?
Is she alright?

445
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,780
嘿  抱歉
Sorry.

446
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:21,280
嘿  伙计  没想到你也上来了
Sorry, I didn't expect to see you up here.

447
00:33:21,730 --> 00:33:22,700
我上来拿点东西
I just came up to get something.

448
00:33:23,650 --> 00:33:25,330
你老婆叫你监视我?
Did your wife send you up here to spy on me?

449
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:26,700
不是
No.

450
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,370
我们看起来像患了妄想症的雅痞吗?
Do we come off as paranoid yuppies or something?

451
00:33:32,890 --> 00:33:34,480
我偷喷了点你老婆的香水
I stole a squirt of your wife's perfume.

452
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:35,690
真的?
Really?

453
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,620
闻起来会很开心
It's Clinique Happy.

454
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:39,840
闻一下  感受一下这个香味
Get a whiff of those sparkling topnotes!

455
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:42,840
这些可以让我感到  开心?
Is that supposed to make me feel happy?

456
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:44,700
你当然应该感到开心  老弟
You should feel happy, Holmes.

457
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:49,500
我会给你和瓦内萨一个生命作礼物  吃喝拉哭呀
I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life. Sweet, screaming, pooping life!

458
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:51,870
而且你们也看不到它被包着  
And you don't even have to be there when it comes out all covered in...

459
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:53,150
看到什么?
Viscera?

460
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:54,480
血乎乎的生出来
Blood and guts.

461
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:00,010
那是Les Paul?  (著名吉它品牌吉普森)
Is that a Les Paul?

462
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:02,470
是的  没错
Yes, it is.

463
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,680
瓦内萨把那个房间留给我用
Vanessa gave me my own room for all my stuff.

464
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:09,900
她留给你整间屋中的  一间房来放你的东西?
She gave you your own room in your whole house for your stuff?

465
00:34:11,430 --> 00:34:12,950
她人真好  不是吗?  马克
She's got you on a long leash there, Mark.

466
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:15,490
哦  太美了
Oh, it's beautiful.

467
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:18,730
知道吗  我一直认为吉普森吉他比芬达的好的多
You know? I always loved Gibson way more than Fender.

468
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:21,060
你弹什么的?
What do you play?

469
00:34:21,510 --> 00:34:22,870
我弹和弦啊
I rock a Harmony.

470
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:26,810
这是什么?  红木做的?
So is it mahagony?

471
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:31,530
这个柄弄断了咋办?
What happens if you crack the neck?

472
00:34:31,810 --> 00:34:33,290
你知道弄坏了会有什么后果
Tell me about it. I used to play in this really tight

473
00:34:33,290 --> 00:34:34,820
我以前在芝加哥加入过一个乐队  
band when I lived in Chicago and one night we opened up

474
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:37,190
有晚为Melvins乐队暖场弄坏了
for the Melvins and I busted that thing right on

475
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:39,020
花了我800多块
stage and it cost me $800 just to get it fixed.

476
00:34:40,990 --> 00:34:42,400
那是在什么  
When was that?

477
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:44,420
93年  摇滚的巅峰年代
'93. Best time for rock and roll.

478
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:50,340
应该是77年啊  (93年)朋克专辑是最热的
Nuh- uh, '77! Punk Volume #1.

479
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:51,770
你疯了
You're crazy.

480
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,100
你那时在场?
You weren't there,

481
00:34:53,370 --> 00:34:54,770
你不会懂朋克的魔力
You couldn't understand the magic.

482
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:56,210
你还未出生呢
You weren't even alive!

483
00:34:58,670 --> 00:34:59,350
那是什么?
What's that?

484
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,950
我的普拉提机
It's a Pilates machine.

485
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,490
你用这个干嘛?
What do you make with it?

486
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:11,170
没什么  是个锻炼器械而已
You don't make anything. It's for exercising.

487
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,590
我老婆看电视订购了类似的  
My wife ordered one of those

488
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:17,340
一个健身电视栏目
Tony Little Gazelles off the TV.

489
00:35:17,980 --> 00:35:19,290
那个扎着马尾巴辫子的推销员
You know, from the guy with the ponytail?

490
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,900
我怎么都看他不顺眼
That guy just doesn't look right to me.

491
00:35:31,050 --> 00:35:32,280
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

492
00:35:34,930 --> 00:35:35,760
抱歉
Excuse me.

493
00:35:45,010 --> 00:35:45,650
嗨
Hi.

494
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,040
嗨
Hi.

495
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:48,440
你们在交流音乐啊
You're playing music?

496
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,750
朱诺想弹一弹"金宝"
Juno wanted a little closer look at Kimber.

497
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,990
你的吉它叫金宝?
Your guitar is named Kimber?

498
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:53,990
对
Yeah.

499
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:56,360
名字很酷  我以前那个叫罗斯福
That's cool. My axe is named Roosevelt.

500
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,430
现在的叫富兰克林  但我想改更辣的名如波丽雅
After Franklin, not Ted. He was the hot one with polio.

501
00:36:01,940 --> 00:36:04,100
我们能下楼去吗?  我们还有  
Gerta is downstairs, we still have

502
00:36:04,820 --> 00:36:06,050
还有很多事情要讨论
a lot of stuff to go over.

503
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,570
给我来拿吧
I got it.

504
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,180
我不想打断你们
Not to interrupt the jam session.

505
00:36:15,270 --> 00:36:18,580
仔细看看  如有问题的话就打电话给我
So, just look these over and if you have any questions, call me at my office.

506
00:36:19,130 --> 00:36:21,540
我们真的非常感谢
We would really appreciate it if you would

507
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:23,940
还请你随时保持联系  
just keep us updated on any doctor's appointments,

508
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,970
告诉我们进展  如果不麻烦的话
Ultrasounds, anything of that nature.

509
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:30,190
当然不  我知道  我会告诉你们的
For sure. You want to know how your kid is cooking, I get it.

510
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,910
你确信要这么做了?
You think you're really going to do this, then?

511
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:37,100
当然  我喜欢你们
Yeah. I like you guys.

512
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:40,930
你有多确信呢?
How sure would you say you are?

513
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,250
是80%呢还是90%呢?
Would you say you're 80% sure, 90% sure?

514
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:50,530
我会说104%确信
I'm going to say I'm about 104% sure.

515
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,160
真的?
Really?

516
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:57,690
如果我现在就可把这"东西"给你们  我会毫不犹豫
Seriously, if I could just have the thing and give it to you now, I totally would,

517
00:36:58,070 --> 00:37:01,180
不过我猜他现在像是只盐水虾般
But I'm guessing it looks probably like a Sea Monkey right now,

518
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,830
至少得等他长的可爱一点吧
And we should let it get a little cuter, right?

519
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,270
-是的  -很好
- Yeah. - Great.

520
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,610
说的对
Keep it in the oven.

521
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:08,850
这个主意不错
I think that's a great idea.

522
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,020
很高兴认识你们
Nice to meet you both.

523
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:13,000
-我也是  -路上当心  希望很快有好消息
Please, drive carefully. Hopefully we'll hear from you soon.

524
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,370
-保重  -再见
- Take care. - Buh bye.

525
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:41,500
冬天来了

526
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:52,780
嘿  伙计
Hey, man.

527
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,530
嘿  维惴  好吗?
Hey, Vijay.

528
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,270
你听说没有  朱诺・麦高夫怀孕
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?

529
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,740
有
Yeah.

530
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,310
-就好像我们妈妈和老师那样  -对
- Like our moms and teachers! - Yeah.

531
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,660
他们说是你的种?
Did you hear it's yours?

532
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:04,520
对
Yup.

533
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:06,550
太不幸了伙计
What a trip, man.

534
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,660
我自己都不知道怎么回事
I don't really know too much about it.

535
00:38:09,500 --> 00:38:10,780
你为什么不留胡子呢?
You should grow a moustache.

536
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:12,560
长不出来
I can't.

537
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,700
我也是
Me neither.

538
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,470
我决定不穿内裤了
But I'm going to stop wearing underpants.

539
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,980
我的精子活力在下降  再见
Raise my sperm count.

540
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:45,300
朱诺
Juno, hey.

541
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:46,200
嘿  保利
Hey, Bleek.

542
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,120
我们一会儿去看电影一边吃甜甜圈  
Me and some guys are gonna go to the movies after school and

543
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:51,830
电影里那个家伙有18个孩子
we're gonna donut that flick with the guy who has eighteen kids.

544
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:53,300
你跟我们一起去吗?
Do you want to come?

545
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,650
听起来主意不错  但我要去做超声波
Sounds awesome, but I got my ultrasound.

546
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,530
哦  是吗?
Oh, really?

547
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:00,840
我能不能  
Can I...

548
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:03,500
需要我陪你吗?
Should I come?

549
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,650
你不能把这些甜甜圈都浪费了
Oh, you can't waste those donut balls,

550
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:11,720
或者我可以晚一会儿去
But maybe I could drop by later.

551
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,610
好的
Okay, cool.

552
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:15,500
-再见保利  -再见
- Later, Bleek. - See ya.

553
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,090
我会帮你留个座
I'll save you a seat.

554
00:39:30,940 --> 00:39:31,920
这就是你的宝宝
There's your baby.

555
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:33,950
哦  我的天哪
Oh, my God.

556
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:37,360
那个是手
There's a hand.

557
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,030
这里是胳膊
And an arm.

558
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,840
脚在这儿
And there's the feet.

559
00:39:49,450 --> 00:39:50,370
朱诺  看到你的宝宝吗?
Would you look at that?

560
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,530
哦  快看那大脑袋  伙计  真是吓人哦
Check out Baby Big- Head. Dude, that thing is freaky looking!

561
00:39:56,480 --> 00:39:58,930
不好意思  
Excuse me, I am a sacred vessel.

562
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,190
我不就像个神圣的皮囊装了个人吗?
All you've got in your stomach is Taco Bell!

563
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:05,070
真奇怪你们犯得着  这样激动流泪吗?
It's amazing that there's actually saps that cry at this.

564
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:08,180
说什么呢?  我可不是铁石心肠的人
What? I'm not made of stone.

565
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:10,800
好了  结束了
Well, there you have it.

566
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:12,920
你们想知道性别吗?
Would you like to know the sex?

567
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:14,140
-好  -不
- Yes. - No.

568
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,110
-拜托了  -不行  绝对不要
- Please, Junebug? - No sex.

569
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,760
准备出生的时候来个惊喜?
Planning to be surprised when you deliver?

570
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:21,230
是的  我希望给马克和瓦内萨一个惊喜
I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised,

571
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,430
假如你告诉了我们就不好保守秘密了
and if you told me, I'll just ruin everything.

572
00:40:23,970 --> 00:40:25,750
马克和瓦内萨是你学校的同学?
Are Mark and Vanessa your friends at school?

573
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,230
不是  他们是孩子准养父母
No, they're the adoptive parents.

574
00:40:28,810 --> 00:40:29,920
哦  太好了  真是谢天谢地
Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.

575
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:32,430
你这话是什么意思?
What's that supposed to mean?

576
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,060
我在这里看过很多未成年妈妈
I just see a lot of teenage mothers come through here.

577
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,310
这种环境下对孩子成长太有害了
It's obviously a poisonous environment to raise a baby in.

578
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,340
你怎么就知道我做得很差呢?
How do you know that I'm so poisonous?

579
00:40:41,710 --> 00:40:44,930
你怎么知道那些养父母就不是恋童癖呢?
What if these adoptive parents turn out to be evil molesters?

580
00:40:45,180 --> 00:40:47,150
和假冒的夫妇
Or like stage parents.

581
00:40:47,390 --> 00:40:49,790
他们可能完全不合格!
They could be utterly negligent. Maybe they'll do a far shittier job

582
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:52,030
可能我继女更懂得抚养
of raising a kid than my dumbass stepdaughter ever would.

583
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:52,890
你想过吗?
Have you considered that?

584
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:55,260
我想没有
No, I guess not.

585
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:57,980
你的工作头衔叫什么?
What is your job title, exactly?

586
00:40:59,010 --> 00:41:01,850
我是个超声波技师  女士
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

587
00:41:02,450 --> 00:41:05,810
我是个美甲师  我觉得我们应该先管好自己的工作
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think we both ought to stick to what we know.

588
00:41:06,350 --> 00:41:07,120
你的意思是?
Excuse me?

589
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:12,340
你以为坐在那拍个片就很拽吗?
You think you're so special because you get to play Picture Pages up there?

590
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:13,500
我五岁的女儿都能做得好
My five year- old daughter could do that,

591
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,600
她还不是最聪明的那个呢
and let me tell you, she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed.

592
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,920
你不如回去夜校读些有用课程  学点真本事吧
So why don't you go back to night school in Manteno and learn a real trade!

593
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:25,350
布伦  你酷毙了
Bren, you's a dick!

594
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:27,810
爱死你了
I love it.

595
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:33,080
朱诺  噢  没料到是你啊
Juno? Wow, I didn't expect to see you here.

596
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:36,400
我有些好东西要给你们看看  瓦内萨在家吗?
I have something really cool to show you guys. Is Vanessa here?

597
00:42:37,850 --> 00:42:39,980
哦她不在  她今晚要加班加点  
No, actually she's working late tonight.

598
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,840
然后省出时间来  
She's trying to accrue as much time off as she can before...

599
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:44,960
对  她得腾出时间来
Oh right. I hear these are quite the time- suck.

600
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,430
快进来吧  我有人参果汁
Wanna come in? I was just having a Ginseng Cooler.

601
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:50,010
要喝点吗?
Would you like one?

602
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:53,380
这些就是富人喝的东西吧?
What is it with you rich people and your herb- infused juices?

603
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:56,470
因为我们和这44盒装的饮品有缘分
It's probably got something to do with those forty four- packs they come in.

604
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,290
它们味道不错啊
They're not bad, though.

605
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:01,410
为什么你不工作?
Why aren't you at work?

606
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:04,020
我在家里工作  我是个作曲家
I work mostly from home. I'm a composer.

607
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:06,680
哦  我靠
No shit.

608
00:43:07,350 --> 00:43:08,610
就像约翰内斯・勃拉姆斯(德国名作曲家)?
Like Johannes Brahms?

609
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:10,790
不是  更商业点的
No, more commercial stuff.

610
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,370
例如呢?
Like what?

611
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,850
广告歌曲
Commercials.

612
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,440
你看过凯胜男用除臭机广告吗?
Have you seen the ads for the Titanium Power men's deodorant?

613
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:29,940
对  这个厨房就是靠这广告挣的
Paid for this kitchen.

614
00:43:32,720 --> 00:43:33,720
赚得好啊!
You're quite the sellout, Mark.

615
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:37,190
Melvins乐队该说什么好呢?
What would the Melvins say?

616
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,050
你不是说有东西要给我看吗?
Did you say you had something to show me.

617
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:43,520
注意了先生  你未来的宝宝
Behold, good sir! Your future child.

618
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,440
嘿  让我看看
Hey, look at that.

619
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:52,070
我猜会和我朋友保利有点像
I think it looks like my friend Paulie.

620
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:55,490
他是个光头的?
Is he also bald and amorphous?

621
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,880
他是爸爸
No, he's the dad.

622
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:01,350
你知道是男孩还是女孩?
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?

623
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:06,290
我可以要求  医生也知道  不过我想留个惊喜
I can't, the doctor can. But I kind of want it to be a surprise.

624
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:09,820
就这么两个可能
Well, it can only go one of two ways.

625
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:11,530
随你怎么想了
That's what you think.

626
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,520
我可是能豪饮啊  所以可能生个不男不女的
I drink tons of booze so you might end up with

627
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,520
还缺胳膊少腿
one of those scary neuter- babies that's born without junk.

628
00:44:17,350 --> 00:44:18,110
缺胳膊少腿?
Junk, huh?

629
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:20,240
对  缺胳膊少腿
You know, it's parts.

630
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:21,550
我知道是什么
I know what junk is.

631
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:22,520
嗯
Yeah, right.

632
00:44:22,820 --> 00:44:23,830
我们可要四肢健全的啊  拜托了
We definitely want it to have some junk, please.

633
00:44:24,780 --> 00:44:25,990
你不用担心
Well, you don't need to worry about a thing.

634
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:29,990
我继母照让我吃得超级健康
My stepmom, Bren, makes me eat super healthy.

635
00:44:30,690 --> 00:44:32,880
我连微波炉前都不能站
I can't stand in front of the microwave and no red M&Ms.

636
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,670
或者吃M&M的巧克力豆  我倒希望你真的准备好了
I hope you're ready.

637
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,130
哦  听到了吗?
Ooh... do you hear that?

638
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:41,020
什么?
What?

639
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,450
这是我最喜爱的歌曲
This is my favorite song.

640
00:44:42,450 --> 00:44:45,770
音速青年乐队的《巨星》专辑  翻唱卡朋特乐队的曲子
It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.

641
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,550
是的  我知道卡朋特
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know the Carpenters.

642
00:44:48,380 --> 00:44:51,270
女人鼓手和古怪男人  和白线乐队风格相象
Chick drummer, freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes.

643
00:44:51,670 --> 00:44:53,940
对  你不会听过这种风格的卡朋特
You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Just listen.

644
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:05,540
对  我喜欢这个
Yeah, I like this.

645
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:07,930
你说你最喜欢的乐队是哪个?
What did you say your favorite band was?

646
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:13,500
是斯徒奇  派迪史密斯和逃离乐队的结合
Didn't. It's a three- way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.

647
00:45:13,770 --> 00:45:16,320
我给你听一些我最喜爱的CD  毕竟你肚子里有我的孩子
I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid's in there.

648
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,000
《血之魔术师》?
The Wizard of Gore?

649
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:26,360
戈登路易斯  恐怖片大师的杰作
That is Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror.

650
00:45:26,960 --> 00:45:31,300
拜托  达里欧・阿基多  才是真正的恐怖片大师
Please. Dario Argento is so the ultimate master of horror.

651
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:33,610
阿基多?
Argento?

652
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:37,270
他也不错  但是路易斯的风格是完全神经错乱
He's alright, but Lewis is completely dimented.

653
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:39,730
一大堆的粘液  全是红色的糖浆
We're talking buckets of goo.

654
00:45:39,730 --> 00:45:44,300
还有放在阴阳图上的人造大脑
Red corn syrup all over the place. Fake brains coming out the yin- yang.

655
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,490
实话说吧  这片有点傻叉
Quite frankly, this looks a little stupid.

656
00:45:49,610 --> 00:45:50,390
碟片给我
Give me the tape.

657
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,440
这片比得上阿基多的《阴风阵阵》
This is even better than Suspiria.

658
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:08,720
我告诉过你的
What'd I tell ya?

659
00:46:09,070 --> 00:46:12,600
伙计  你看恐怖片还真的挺有品位
You have decent taste in slasher movies.

660
00:46:13,570 --> 00:46:14,860
小小兴趣而已
Here's to dovetailing interests.

661
00:46:18,700 --> 00:46:20,170
你们给宝宝起名字了吗?
Have you guys thought of any names for the baby yet?

662
00:46:22,150 --> 00:46:25,350
算是有吧  如果是女儿  瓦内萨希望叫麦迪逊
Sort of, yes. Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.

663
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,740
麦迪逊?  等等
Madison?

664
00:46:32,690 --> 00:46:35,790
这听起来  很断背的感觉?!
Isn't that a little, gay?

665
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,680
哦  难道大家都得起个  古老神秘的名字叫"朱诺"?
Well, pretentious much? Should everyone just have a mysterious name like Juno?

666
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:48,570
知道吗  我老爸对古罗马和古希腊的神话很着迷
My dad went through this huge obsession with Roman and Greek mythology.

667
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:51,980
所以他决定用宙斯老婆的名字给我命名
He decided to name me after Zeus's wife,

668
00:46:52,590 --> 00:46:57,050
宙斯很花心  不过我肯定  朱诺是他唯一的妻子
Zeus had tons of lays, but I'm pretty sure Juno was his only wife.

669
00:46:58,510 --> 00:47:02,260
而且她很漂亮  就和黛安娜王妃一样
She was supposed to be really beautiful but really mean. Like Diana Ross.

670
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:05,040
嗯  很适合你
That suits you.

671
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:07,990
谢谢?!
Thanks?

672
00:47:11,470 --> 00:47:12,650
你挺特别的
You're something else.

673
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,900
瓦内萨回来了  你得走了
Vanessa. You'd better go.

674
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,340
她不喜欢看到我"无所作为"地看恐怖片
She hates when I sit around watching movies and I don't contribute.

675
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:29,460
我来告诉她  我总能让人信服
I'll handle this. I'm really good at diffusing mom- type rage.

676
00:47:29,710 --> 00:47:30,440
不  朱诺  不
No, Juno, no.

677
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,600
嘿朱诺  怎么了?
Juno, what's going on?

678
00:47:35,050 --> 00:47:36,300
-没什么  -你来这里干嘛?  出什么事情了?
- Nothing. - What are you doing here? What's wrong?

679
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,770
只是我今天去看医生了
Nothing, I went to the doctor today.

680
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:38,960
宝宝有问题?
Is there something wrong with the baby?

681
00:47:39,210 --> 00:47:39,810
宝宝很健康
The baby is great.

682
00:47:39,810 --> 00:47:42,130
什么都正常  还看到了它的脚趾头
It's the right size and everything. I even saw its phalanges today!

683
00:47:42,850 --> 00:47:44,030
看看吧
Here.

684
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:46,360
是个宝宝
It's the baby.

685
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:48,090
你的宝宝
It's your baby.

686
00:47:52,370 --> 00:47:54,710
感觉它好像在招手
It kinda looks like it's waving.

687
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:59,070
"嘿瓦内萨  你愿意做我妈妈吗?"
Like it's saying "Hey, Vanessa. Will you be my mom?"

688
00:48:00,020 --> 00:48:01,300
太不可思议了
Yeah, it kind of does.

689
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,510
朱诺  特地把片子拿过来给我们看
Juno was nice enough to bring that over for us today.

690
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,560
对  刚抹掉肚子上的超声波液  我就赶来了
I came as soon as I got that ultrasound goo off my pelvis.

691
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:10,100
真是难以置信
It was crazy actually,

692
00:48:10,650 --> 00:48:14,940
我继母还为此  和B超检查师吵了一架
My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we got escorted off the premises.

693
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:22,070
看看你们都买了一大堆的东西
Wow, what kind of swag did you score?

694
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,080
准妈妈购物狂
Mall madness, huh?

695
00:48:24,210 --> 00:48:25,800
只是为宝宝准备的一些东西而已
It's just some stuff I picked up for the baby.

696
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,020
宝宝受洗礼时等别人送就行了
Don't you usually get all that stuff at a baby shower?

697
00:48:29,690 --> 00:48:33,110
我后妈怀着我妹时  亲友送了一屋子礼物
When my stepmom was pregnant with my little sister she got a million gifts.

698
00:48:33,900 --> 00:48:36,050
不过我一点也不嫉妒  因为那些东西超级烂
But I wasn't jealous 'cause they all were super lame.

699
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:38,050
我怀疑没有人会送礼物
I doubt anyone's gonna throw us a shower.

700
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,260
为什么呢?
Why wouldn't they throw you a baby shower?

701
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:44,100
我不知道该怎么说  
I don't think people know how to feel about this situation

702
00:48:44,100 --> 00:48:46,970
因为事情并还不是板上钉钉
because it's not set in stone.

703
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:48,380
你的意思是?
What isn't set...

704
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:53,270
不不不  你该不会认为我会最后关头退出吧?
You don't think I'm going to flake out on you?

705
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:54,770
不是这个意思
No, I don't, Juno.

706
00:48:56,110 --> 00:48:57,770
我们曾经历过那样的情况
We went through a situation before

707
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,460
最后都不成事
where it didn't work out.

708
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:00,780
对  恐惧后遗症
Cold feet.

709
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:07,380
哦  你们该去中国
You should have gone to China.

710
00:49:09,110 --> 00:49:11,580
他们送小孩如送免费iPod
I hear they give away babies like free iPods.

711
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:14,530
好像把宝宝放到礼炮里
They put 'em in those T- shirt guns

712
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:16,770
然后以40秒速  "砰"的打出去
and shoot them out at sporting events.

713
00:49:19,780 --> 00:49:22,110
你父母现在可能在担心你在哪里
Your parents are probably wondering where you are.

714
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,160
我已经都怀孕了
Naah. I'm already pregnant,

715
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:26,720
死猪不怕开水烫了  对吧?
so what other kind of shenanigans could I get into?

716
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,670
不过  我也该走了
I should probably bounce.

717
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,170
别忘了你的包
Hey, don't forget your bag.

718
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:32,610
谢了
Ah, bag!

719
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,110
好的  保重
Okay, take care.

720
00:50:02,010 --> 00:50:02,970
你哪儿去了朱朱?
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?

721
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:07,100
我给马克和瓦内萨看超声波结果
I just drove to St. Cloud to show Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.

722
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:08,800
在他家呆了一会
I ended up staying for a couple of hours.

723
00:50:09,550 --> 00:50:11,970
一会?  你干嘛直接就去他们哪儿了?
A couple of hours? Why are you going over there in the first place?

724
00:50:12,990 --> 00:50:17,350
不是说好随时告诉宝宝最新情况吗?  所以我就去了
They wanted to know about this stuff. I said I'd keep them updated, so I did!

725
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:19,340
那你也可以邮寄给他们啊
You could have mailed it to them.

726
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:22,290
你干嘛自己开车去那个什么  地方?
Why would you drive an hour out to East Jesus, Nowhere?

727
00:50:24,310 --> 00:50:26,500
我就是这么做了
I don't know, I just did.

728
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,880
在等瓦内萨回来时  
And while Mark and I were waiting for Vanessa,

729
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:30,090
我和马克一起看了《血之魔术师》
we watched The Wizard of Gore,

730
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:34,390
他给我录了一些很拉风的CD
And he burned me a couple of CDs of this weird music.

731
00:50:35,390 --> 00:50:36,330
很酷  不错
He's kind of cool.

732
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:42,140
朱诺  你不能就这样去马克那儿的
Juno, you can't just drop in on them like that.

733
00:50:43,230 --> 00:50:46,950
这没什么大不了的  他们也没什么呀
No, it was not a big deal. He was totally cool with it.

734
00:50:47,340 --> 00:50:48,250
你不了解
You don't understand.

735
00:50:48,540 --> 00:50:50,530
马克是有妇之夫你们要保持距离
Mark is a married man, there are boundaries.

736
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:52,620
得了吧
Oh, come on.

737
00:50:52,930 --> 00:50:53,800
听着  
Listen,

738
00:50:54,110 --> 00:50:55,120
布伦  
Bren- duhhh.

739
00:50:56,110 --> 00:50:59,200
听起来好像是你要面对这一切
You're acting like you're the one who has to go through this

740
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:02,450
好像是你挺着个大肚为别人生孩子
and get huge and shove a baby out of your vag for someone else.

741
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,760
他是有妇之夫怎么了?
What does it even matter if he's married?

742
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:07,110
我有很多朋友都结婚了
I can have friends that are married.

743
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:08,840
没那么简单的小姑娘
It doesn't work that way, kiddo.

744
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:11,140
你根本不了解婚姻
You don't know squat about the dynamics of marriage.

745
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:12,590
你根本不了解我
You don't know anything about me!

746
00:51:12,900 --> 00:51:13,750
我对你足够了解
I know enough.

747
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:17,620
我们根本就没有狗呢!
We don't even have a dog!

748
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,730
对  因为你对它们的口水过敏
Yeah, because you're allergic to their saliva.

749
00:51:22,010 --> 00:51:25,560
我为你牺牲了很多  朱诺  过几年你不在这里住了
I have sacrificed a lot for you, Juno. But in a couple years when you move out

750
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:27,610
我就会养几条魏玛犬的
I'm going to get Weimaraners.

751
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,280
哦  痴人说梦啊!
Wow, dream big!

752
00:51:29,570 --> 00:51:30,930
滚得远点!
Oh, go fly a kite.

753
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:56,510
嘿朱诺
Hi, Juno.

754
00:51:57,570 --> 00:51:58,350
有什么要帮忙的吗?
What can I do for you?

755
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:01,210
保利在家吗?
Bleeker home?

756
00:52:01,850 --> 00:52:03,930
保利的妈妈以前可能是个"辣妹"
Bleeker's mom was possibly attractive once.

757
00:52:04,460 --> 00:52:05,650
现在倒像"腊霉"(又肥又丑)
But now she looks a hobbit.

758
00:52:08,290 --> 00:52:09,620
你知道就像电影里的哈比人
You know, the fat one that was in The Goonies.

759
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,540
嘿  伙计
Hey, man,

760
00:52:19,260 --> 00:52:21,200
干嘛这么用心  我都闻到你头发冒烟了
Don't concentrate so hard. I think I can smell your hair all burning.

761
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:23,350
有什么事吗?
Hey, what's up?

762
00:52:23,620 --> 00:52:26,690
没事  只是  
Not much, I just wanted to come say hey.

763
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:30,310
怀念以前晚上约会的时光
I miss hanging out with you on school nights.

764
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:34,950
那些橙味跳跳糖是保利唯一的怪癖
Orange Tic- Tacs are Bleeker's one and only vice.

765
00:52:36,080 --> 00:52:39,370
我怀孕的那晚  他嘴的味道犹如甜甜的糖果
The day I got pregnant, his mouth tasted really tangy and delicious.

766
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:50,760
感觉怎么样?  看起来  
You seem to be getting...

767
00:52:51,380 --> 00:52:52,570
你变的像个孕妇了
...pregnant- er these days.

768
00:52:55,850 --> 00:52:58,230
你知道我找了一对收养的父母  
Ya know, I set up this whole private adoption...

769
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:03,570
住在库洛区的一对夫妇  他们很适合做养父母
and this married couple in Saint Cloud are going to be the parents.

770
00:53:04,200 --> 00:53:04,790
真的
Really?

771
00:53:05,990 --> 00:53:07,160
他们看起来怎么样?
What are they like?

772
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:10,130
哦  那个男的很不错
The guy, he's awesome.

773
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:12,160
他叫马克
His name is Mark and

774
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:15,490
他喜欢看老恐怖电影  弹吉它  
he likes old horror movies and he plays the guitar.

775
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:17,570
事实上  下午我们一直在一起
We actually hung out this afternoon.

776
00:53:18,410 --> 00:53:19,410
没问题吗?
Is that normal?

777
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:21,510
或许不吧  不过  
Probably not, but...

778
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:26,480
听着  我和我爸爸和布伦说了  他们不会跟你家人说的
I talked to dad and Bren and they said they wouldn't narc you out to your folks,

779
00:53:27,510 --> 00:53:28,430
不用担心
So,

780
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,610
放轻松就行了
I think we should be cool.

781
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:32,510
我觉得轻松多了
That's a relief.

782
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:40,320
我现在看起来  
I'm gonna start looking

783
00:53:40,870 --> 00:53:42,010
像只大胖狗
like a pretty big dork soon.

784
00:53:43,740 --> 00:53:46,260
你还会觉得我可爱吗?
Will you still think I'm cute when I'm huge?

785
00:53:47,580 --> 00:53:49,080
我一直觉得你很可爱
I always think you're cute.

786
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:51,020
你很迷人
I think you're beautiful.

787
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:52,690
老天!  保利
Jeez, Bleek.

788
00:53:53,940 --> 00:53:54,900
真的
I do.

789
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:01,600
朱诺  等这一切过去  我们一起重组乐队
Hey Junebug, when this is all over we should get the band back together.

790
00:54:02,410 --> 00:54:03,960
对  应该要
Yeah.

791
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:06,000
这个主意不错
That would be awesome.

792
00:54:06,470 --> 00:54:08,290
我是说重组以后我们整个队  
Once Tino gets a new drumhead

793
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,430
可以一起摇滚了
we're just, like, ready to rock.

794
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:14,180
而且  我觉得我们也可以重新一起
We could always get back together too.

795
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:16,030
看你了
That's an option.

796
00:54:20,660 --> 00:54:22,290
我们在一起过吗?
Were we together?

797
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,040
是啊  你知道  
Yeah, we were once.

798
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,360
有那么一次
That time.

799
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:35,170
卡特里娜怎么样?
What about Katrina De Voort?

800
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,810
你可以和她一起呀
You could totally go out with Katrina De Voort.

801
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:40,090
我不喜欢卡特里娜  她闻起来有股肉汤味
I don't like Katrina.

802
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:41,720
你没闻到过?
She smells like soup.

803
00:54:42,270 --> 00:54:43,440
她的整个房间闻起来都有肉汤味
Her whole house smells of soup.

804
00:54:53,020 --> 00:54:53,850
好了
Okay.

805
00:54:55,610 --> 00:54:58,600
现在可以选择奶油色或者奶酪色
So we have Custard, Cheesecake.

806
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:00,710
都是黄色
They're yellow.

807
00:55:02,760 --> 00:55:04,850
我想用这些比较中性的自然色
I wanted to pick something that was gender- neutral until

808
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:07,080
然后可以加一些其它的什么
we get the baby and then we can add a more decisive palette.

809
00:55:08,990 --> 00:55:12,130
你认为黄色是中性自然色?
Why does everyone think yellow is gender- neutral?

810
00:55:12,490 --> 00:55:13,550
我所认识的人里  没有把房间涂成黄色的
I don't know any guy with a yellow bedroom.

811
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,790
我觉得这个色度的奶油色不错
I'm thinking more Custard with this light.

812
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,900
或许我们应该先小部分试一下
I don't know. Maybe I should paint a larger swatch...

813
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,470
为什么我们不能等几个月?
Or you could wait a few more months.

814
00:55:29,770 --> 00:55:32,940
反正宝宝又不会现在  出现要求刷成沙漠的颜色
It's not like the baby's going to storm in here demanding dessert- colored walls.

815
00:55:38,360 --> 00:55:44,240
《期待》说宝宝房间对妈妈来说很重要
"What to Expect" says that readying the baby's room is an important process for the woman.

816
00:55:44,710 --> 00:55:46,860
尤其是收养妈妈  术名叫"安巢"
Especially if you're adopting. It's called "nesting. "

817
00:55:48,180 --> 00:55:49,180
"安巢"?
Nesting?

818
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,150
你要用口水树枝搭个巢吗?
Are you going to build the crib out of sticks and spit?

819
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,650
我想你应该看看那本书  讲父亲角色那章我做了标记
You should read the book. I flagged the "daddy chapters" for you.

820
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:02,300
我觉得现在漆墙太早了
I think it's too early to paint.

821
00:56:02,790 --> 00:56:03,850
我就是这么想的
That's my opinion.

822
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,210
我不同意
I disagree.

823
00:56:10,490 --> 00:56:11,830
这个墙上也要放点东西
This wall is going to need something.

824
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:17,350
挂一幅全家福照片
Our first family photo right in the middle.

825
00:56:18,570 --> 00:56:19,500
就在正中间
Right up there.

826
00:56:23,110 --> 00:56:24,110
想象得到吗?
Can you see it?

827
00:56:28,320 --> 00:56:30,660
这甜甜圈吃起来味道很棒
Yum! This pretzel tastes like a friggin' donut!

828
00:56:31,100 --> 00:56:32,130
给我尝尝
Share the love, sweetness!

829
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:33,380
不给
You can't have any.

830
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:36,350
停下
She's assaulting me!

831
00:56:37,320 --> 00:56:38,570
我喘不过气来了
She's denying me fresh- baked goodness!

832
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:40,530
哦  天哪!
Oh, my God.

833
00:56:42,490 --> 00:56:43,780
那个是瓦内萨
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.

834
00:56:45,180 --> 00:56:46,500
杂志上找的那个收养者?
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?

835
00:56:50,380 --> 00:56:52,060
姐妹  她看起来很正点啊
Dude, she's, like, really pretty.

836
00:56:52,380 --> 00:56:54,190
感觉你很吃惊啊
You sound totally shocked or something.

837
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:58,460
她好象是要把那个小宝宝偷走做收藏品
She's totally gonna steal that kid for her collection.

838
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,050
对  很像
Right, seriously.

839
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:10,800
无聊啊
Boring!

840
00:57:21,080 --> 00:57:25,660
我想我可以吃一大块曲奇饼干  外加卷着的大块羊肉
I could so go for a huge cookie right now with like, a lamb kebab, simultaneously.

841
00:57:26,670 --> 00:57:29,200
你怎好像饿死鬼投胎一样
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

842
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:32,750
好象永无止境地吃
It's like, never- ending for you.

843
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:34,940
朱诺!
Juno!

844
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:36,030
嗨!  瓦内萨
Hi, Vanessa!

845
00:57:36,420 --> 00:57:38,480
你来这里干嘛?
What brings you to the mall today?

846
00:57:38,990 --> 00:57:41,130
逛街  那边是我的一些女朋友
I was just shopping with my girlfriends.

847
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,080
你是女同性恋?
You're gay?

848
00:57:43,390 --> 00:57:44,060
对不起她开玩笑的
No.

849
00:57:44,380 --> 00:57:45,640
没事
Just ignore her.

850
00:57:46,050 --> 00:57:47,310
你感觉怎么样?
Well, how are you feeling?

851
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,420
很好  一切都很好
Great! Everything's stupendous.

852
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:52,660
哦  肚脐眼像个按扭
Oh, coming in on that snooze button.

853
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:56,020
太不可思议了
That's incredible.

854
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:58,200
天哪
Oh, God.

855
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:00,340
怎么了?
What?

856
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:01,970
它在踢我
Kicking away.

857
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,030
我可以  摸一下吗?
Could I feel it?

858
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:09,250
开什么玩笑
Are you kidding?

859
00:58:11,550 --> 00:58:14,810
在学校里所有的人  都来摸我的肚子的  疯狂极了
At school everyone's just grabbing my belly all the time.

860
00:58:15,330 --> 00:58:17,550
我是个传奇人物了  他们都叫我大鲸鱼的
I'm a legend. They call me the Cautionary Whale.

861
00:58:22,170 --> 00:58:23,230
我什么都感觉不到
I can't feel anything.

862
00:58:26,620 --> 00:58:27,660
它不是为我而动
It's not moving for me.

863
00:58:30,230 --> 00:58:31,590
你应该试试和它讲话
You should try talking to it.

864
00:58:31,590 --> 00:58:35,230
因为它能听见你的  虽然可能听起来很遥远
They can hear you, even though it's all ten thousand leagues under the sea.

865
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:51,810
嘿  宝宝
Hi, baby.

866
00:58:57,160 --> 00:58:59,200
我  我是瓦内萨
It's me. It's Vanessa.

867
00:59:04,280 --> 00:59:06,110
我很想见你  迫不及待
I can't wait to meet you.

868
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,420
你能听见我说话吗宝贝?
Can you hear me, baby?

869
00:59:16,970 --> 00:59:18,110
我的天使  
Sweet angel?

870
00:59:29,150 --> 00:59:30,610
我能感觉到
I felt it!

871
00:59:33,010 --> 00:59:34,150
太神奇了!
That was magical.

872
00:59:39,650 --> 00:59:40,650
谢谢
Thank you.

873
00:59:41,140 --> 00:59:42,150
谢谢
Thank you.

874
00:59:46,780 --> 00:59:51,570
春天到了

875
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:35,410
你好
Hello?

876
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:36,710
"你好"
Hey!

877
01:00:36,960 --> 01:00:40,730
我最近在听你给我的那几张CD
So, I've been listening to that really weird CD that you made me.

878
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:42,120
有什么感想?
Yeah? What's the verdict?

879
01:00:42,680 --> 01:00:43,870
很可爱
Well, it's cute.

880
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:45,540
很可爱?
It's cute?

881
01:00:45,830 --> 01:00:48,640
假如听惯了Iggy和Stooges的摇滚
When you're used to listening to the raw power of Iggy and the Stooges,

882
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:52,040
那其他音乐比起来都会显得软软的
everything else just sounds kind of precious in comparison.

883
01:00:53,070 --> 01:00:55,770
或许你听了一堆的卡朋特  唱片来支持你的观点
I imagine you have a collection of punk chestnuts to prove your point.

884
01:00:56,520 --> 01:00:57,380
那  
Well...

885
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,470
想想你接受过专业音乐的熏陶啊
...consider it your musical education.

886
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:01,870
我等不及你会教我点什么
I can't wait to see what you've got to teach me.

887
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,510
有什么  你还是继续工作吧
Stop surfing porn and get back to work.

888
01:01:05,900 --> 01:01:07,550
我只是打来问问好
Just wanted to call and say hi.

889
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:09,930
那谢谢了
Go learn something.

890
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:16,020
-我感觉像是去墨西哥旅行  -还去了希腊和中国
- Oh, a little trip down Mexico way. - And Greece and China apparently.

891
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:18,240
你已经怀孕几个月了?
How many months has it been now?

892
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:19,680
肚子越来越大了
You're getting huge.

893
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:23,300
八个月了  你肯定不会相信  我裸体时的样子有多么怪异
It's homing in on the eight. You should see how weird I look naked.

894
01:01:24,370 --> 01:01:25,830
我真希望我的乳房能大点
I wish my funbags would get bigger.

895
01:01:26,410 --> 01:01:29,160
相信我你不会的  事实上  我现在不得不戴胸罩
Trust me, you don't. I have to actually wear a friggin' bra now

896
01:01:29,660 --> 01:01:35,210
还要全身都擦上恶心的可可油  免得皮肤松弛过度
and rub all this nasty cocoa butter stuff on myself so my skin won't explode.

897
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:36,550
真火辣!
Hot!

898
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:41,100
为什么全世界都盯着我看啊?
Why is everyone always staring at me?

899
01:01:41,850 --> 01:01:43,460
还不是因为你的肚子像个几何形状了
Well, you are kind of convex, you know?

900
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:48,350
哇!  是吗?  你什么时候做了几何学达人?
Whoah! Who's been doing their geometry homework for once!

901
01:01:48,610 --> 01:01:51,880
我别无选择  基德的身影总是在我眼前晃
I have no choice. Keith has been grading me so hard lately.

902
01:01:52,220 --> 01:01:54,480
-别直呼康纳老师为基德好吗?  -为什么?
Do not call Mr. Conyers "Keith".

903
01:01:54,760 --> 01:01:57,040
恶心啊  因为我的孕妇呕吐症现在超强烈
'Cause my barf reflex is really enheightened these days.

904
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:58,770
基德很野性
But Keith's hot.

905
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:03,500
他满脸胡喳
Eww, he's all beardy!

906
01:02:05,190 --> 01:02:07,780
你听说里克要和卡特里娜一起参加舞会吗?
Did you hear that Bleek is going to the prom with Katrina De Voort?

907
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:11,020
卡特里娜?
Katrina?

908
01:02:11,660 --> 01:02:13,670
不可能  他一点也不喜欢她
No way, he doesn't like Katrina.

909
01:02:13,970 --> 01:02:15,380
他一定是出于怜悯之心
Must be like a pity date or something.

910
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,000
我听说是他主动的  先去本哈拿餐馆
I heard he asked her and that the're going to Benihana,

911
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:20,070
然后去舞会  最后去维惴家的小屋
and then prom, and then Vijay's parents' cabin.

912
01:02:21,490 --> 01:02:23,640
他跟我说她家有股肉汤味
He told me that Katrina's house smells like soup!

913
01:02:23,970 --> 01:02:25,410
老天啊  的确是如此
Oh my God, it totally does.

914
01:02:25,740 --> 01:02:29,270
四年前我去她家参加生日派对时  那味道是够恶心的
I was there four years ago for her birthday party and it was like Lipton Landing.

915
01:02:30,300 --> 01:02:32,690
但是你知道男孩子  为了做爱什么都做得出来?
But you know, boys have endured way worse things for nookie.

916
01:02:34,240 --> 01:02:35,220
哦  得了吧
Oh, please.

917
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:37,550
他们根本不可能发生关系的
There is no way that they're having sex,

918
01:02:37,860 --> 01:02:39,200
他们甚至都不会拉手
They wouldn't even be holding hands.

919
01:02:39,530 --> 01:02:41,110
我也不肯定啊  毕竟你和他有过一腿
I wouldn't be so sure, he did it with you.

920
01:02:41,690 --> 01:02:43,320
对啊  里克很信任我
Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me.

921
01:02:44,020 --> 01:02:45,050
我们是好朋友
We're best friends.

922
01:02:45,460 --> 01:02:46,670
你吃醋了?
Are you jealous?

923
01:02:47,190 --> 01:02:50,140
我以为你不会在意他的事
I thought you said you didn't care what he did.

924
01:02:50,450 --> 01:02:51,470
不是吃醋  不是在乎
Not jealous, don't care.

925
01:02:51,660 --> 01:02:53,700
我只是不相信他会喜欢卡特里娜
I know Bleek doesn't like Katrina and he shouldn't

926
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,940
玩弄别人的感情  况且她真的很不错
toy with her emotions like that. She seems pretty nice.

927
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:58,660
啊哈  我确实相信
Uh- huh, I'm really convinced.

928
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,690
舞会是怪人才去的
Prom is for wenises, anyway.

929
01:03:00,890 --> 01:03:02,990
长大后你会觉得一点也不好玩
As soon as you're old enough to go, it's so not cool anymore.

930
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:15,640
你真的要和卡特里娜・德・沃特一起去舞会?
Are you honestly and truly going to the prom with Katrina De Voort?

931
01:03:17,340 --> 01:03:18,270
嗨!
Uh, hi?

932
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:20,640
只要跟我说"是"或"不是"?
Leah just said that you were gonna go with her.

933
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:23,020
对  我有问过她是否愿意去
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go.

934
01:03:24,000 --> 01:03:26,390
队里的人一起去本哈拿餐馆
A bunch of us from the team are going to Benihana,

935
01:03:26,390 --> 01:03:28,870
然后去舞会  最后去维惴家的海边小屋
then go the prom, then go to Vijay's parents' cabin.

936
01:03:32,150 --> 01:03:34,030
我们租了辆加长豪华车
We're getting a stretch limo.

937
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:36,930
你妈妈一定很高兴  你不是带我去
Your mom must be pretty stoked that you're not taking me.

938
01:03:39,150 --> 01:03:40,050
你生气了  为什么?
You're mad. Why are you mad?

939
01:03:41,510 --> 01:03:43,260
我没有生气
I'm not mad. I'm in a great mood.

940
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:46,070
我很平静  只是不满脱不了这肥厚衣服
Despite the fact that I'm in a fat suit I can't take off,

941
01:03:46,070 --> 01:03:48,350
还有那些在我背后对我指指点点的人
despite the fact that pretty much everyone is making fun of me behind my back,

942
01:03:48,900 --> 01:03:54,120
再有就是你那女朋友在课堂上瞪我看
despite the fact that your girlfriend gave me the stinkeye in art class yesterday.

943
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:58,040
卡特里娜不是我女朋友  我怀疑她有给你脸色看
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I doubt that she gave you the stinkeye.

944
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,480
她脸长得就是那样  脸就那个样
That's just the way her face looks.

945
01:04:04,130 --> 01:04:06,200
随你怎么说吧  你喜爱就跟那肉汤去吧
Just take Soupy Sales to prom,

946
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:09,200
我可以做些比那天晚上更酷的事情
I can think of so many cooler things to do that night.

947
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:13,280
我可以去磨磨我的脚  或去布伦那个笨教堂
I might pumice my feet or go to Bren's Unitarian church,

948
01:04:13,280 --> 01:04:16,630
或者被一辆装着10吨果汁的卡车撞倒
maybe get hit by a truck full of hot garbage juice.

949
01:04:17,100 --> 01:04:20,660
也总好过跟你去舞会
All those things would be exponentially cooler than going to the prom with you.

950
01:04:24,150 --> 01:04:25,350
你的表现很不成熟
You're being really immature.

951
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:30,700
你没理由冲我发火  我是说  
You have no reason to be mad at me. You broke my heart.

952
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,040
伤了我的心  我应该很生气
I should be royally ticked off at you.

953
01:04:33,410 --> 01:04:36,910
应该很沮丧  或者不在理睬你
I should be really cheesed off. I shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.

954
01:04:38,660 --> 01:04:42,410
就因为无聊和你上了床  然后也没打算和你结婚?
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with you, and then I didn't wanna, like, marry you?

955
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:45,900
如果和你结婚  恐怕你会是个泼妇  
Like I'd marry you! You'd be the meanest wife ever.

956
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:47,410
而且我知道你那晚并不无聊
And I know that you weren't bored that day

957
01:04:47,690 --> 01:04:49,360
因为那晚有很多电视节目
because there was a lot of stuff on TV.

958
01:04:49,360 --> 01:04:52,180
而且《女巫布莱尔》也快开始了
The Blair Witch Project was coming on Starz, and you were like,

959
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:55,180
你说你没看过这个  我们应该看一下
"I haven't seen this since it came out,

960
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:58,180
但我们应该做点其他的事  叭啦叭啦  
but we should make out instead. La la la. "

961
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:03,540
我想你该和那肉汤去舞会
You just take Katrina the Douche Packer to the prom.

962
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:05,430
免得以为我有多么的泼辣
I'm sure you two will have a real bitchin' time!

963
01:05:08,300 --> 01:05:09,400
我还留着你的内裤呢
I still have your underwear.

964
01:05:09,830 --> 01:05:11,240
我还留着你的童贞呢
I still have your virginity!

965
01:05:12,080 --> 01:05:13,050
你可以闭嘴吗?
Would you shut up!

966
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,000
你感到羞耻了吗?
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?

967
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:16,930
-不是  -至少  
- No. - 'Cause at least

968
01:05:17,180 --> 01:05:19,240
你的衣服肚皮底下没有留下证据
you don't have to have the evidence under your sweater.

969
01:05:21,770 --> 01:05:22,770
我可是怀孕了
I'm a planet!

970
01:05:27,280 --> 01:05:28,440
等一下  让我帮你拿包
Wait, let me get your bag.

971
01:05:29,690 --> 01:05:30,860
背多10磅又如何?
What's another ten pounds?

972
01:06:17,970 --> 01:06:18,800
嗨!
Hi.

973
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:20,550
看来你很用功呢
Wow. That shirt's working hard.

974
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:21,890
瓦内萨在家吗?
Is Vanessa here?

975
01:06:22,280 --> 01:06:23,950
不在  很安全
No. We are safe.

976
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:27,700
很高兴你能来  我有东西要给你
I'm glad you're here, I actually have something for you.

977
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:33,630
小心点
Almost there.

978
01:06:37,720 --> 01:06:40,100
这里是婴儿房吗?  太妙了
Whoah, Mark! Is this the baby's room? It's beautiful!

979
01:06:41,300 --> 01:06:42,190
你在开玩笑
Hilarious.

980
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:44,570
这里是我藏我的旧漫画书的地方
This is where I keep all my old comics,

981
01:06:45,380 --> 01:06:46,220
给你看看这本
And I want to show you one.

982
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:48,540
你也这么喜欢漫画?
You're one of those guys?

983
01:06:48,630 --> 01:06:49,890
看看
Take a look.

984
01:06:53,420 --> 01:06:55,060
超丰满的Yuki
Most Fruitful Yuki?

985
01:06:56,500 --> 01:06:57,940
那个怀孕女超人吗?
Is this a pregnant superhero?

986
01:06:58,550 --> 01:06:59,460
不错吧!
Isn't that great?

987
01:06:59,750 --> 01:07:01,080
我去日本时买的
I found it in Japan when I was there with my band.

988
01:07:01,080 --> 01:07:01,670
让我想起了你
It reminds me of you.

989
01:07:02,550 --> 01:07:03,670
我靠  当然了
Hells, yeah!

990
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,760
这的确让我感到自己和只母猪不一样了
This actually makes me feel way less of a fat dork.

991
01:07:09,830 --> 01:07:10,810
Yuki爱惹是生非
Yuki is a real bad ass.

992
01:07:10,810 --> 01:07:13,190
和你有共同点  你会感到很自豪
You should be very proud being in the same condition.

993
01:07:14,710 --> 01:07:15,480
谢了
Thank you.

994
01:07:16,710 --> 01:07:17,870
放点Toonish乐队音乐如何?
Oh, how about some tunage?

995
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:20,980
不要看CD目录  管它放那首
Alright, don't look, no matter what.

996
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:26,050
第一首有点慢
This one is actually kinda slow.

997
01:07:26,050 --> 01:07:30,400
但这是他们的风格所以会很酷很硬
But it's Mott the Hoople so it's still totally rad and hardcore.

998
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:36,950
-怎么了?  -我听过这歌
I know this one.

999
01:07:37,340 --> 01:07:40,120
-真的?  -对  它比我还年长
- You do? - Yeah, this song is older than I am.

1000
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,380
我在高中舞会听过
I danced to this at my senior prom.

1001
01:07:43,800 --> 01:07:45,180
你舞伴是谁呢?
Who'd you dance with?

1002
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,580
珊迪・安伯  一个很棒的舞伴
Cynthia Vogel, great dance partner.

1003
01:07:47,580 --> 01:07:49,710
她还让我把手放在她的胸上
She let me put my hands all over her butt.

1004
01:07:49,960 --> 01:07:51,120
很火辣
- Hot. - Very hot.

1005
01:07:52,720 --> 01:07:54,940
我可以想象你跳舞的样子
I can just, totally, picture you dancing,

1006
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,150
像个傻瓜
Like a total dork!

1007
01:08:00,340 --> 01:08:03,760
事实上  也许  你的手应该  放在这儿
Her hands there,

1008
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,710
我的手放这里
And my hands down here.

1009
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,080
这就是我们88年的姿势
This is how we did it in '88.

1010
01:08:08,460 --> 01:08:09,470
像这样
Like this?

1011
01:08:09,850 --> 01:08:10,790
对
Just like this.

1012
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:12,350
你以前跳过舞吗?
You've never been to a dance before?

1013
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:13,910
只有呆子才会跳舞
Dances are for nerds and squares.

1014
01:08:15,490 --> 01:08:16,240
你呢?
What are you?

1015
01:08:17,270 --> 01:08:18,240
我不知道
I don't know.

1016
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,970
感觉到我们中间隔着什么吗?
I feel like there's something between us.

1017
01:08:39,930 --> 01:08:40,900
我要离开瓦内萨了
I'm leaving Vanessa.

1018
01:08:44,570 --> 01:08:45,240
什么?
What?

1019
01:08:45,660 --> 01:08:47,310
我在城里找了个地方
I'm getting a place in the city.

1020
01:08:47,310 --> 01:08:49,990
我计划很久了  这是我长久以来一直想做的事
It's something I've wanted to do for a long time.

1021
01:08:50,270 --> 01:08:50,950
不可以
No!

1022
01:08:51,720 --> 01:08:52,310
不可以?
No?

1023
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:54,300
你当然不可以这样做
No! You definitely can't do that.

1024
01:08:54,580 --> 01:08:55,700
这是件很重要的事  
That's one big, fat sack of no!

1025
01:08:56,530 --> 01:08:57,410
不可以

1026
01:08:58,140 --> 01:08:59,100
有什么问题吗?
What is the matter?

1027
01:09:00,490 --> 01:09:03,440
我是说  你们必须照顾它啊  不是吗?
You guys are supposed to take care of this.

1028
01:09:05,090 --> 01:09:07,610
我想还行吧
I thought you'd be cool with this.

1029
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,620
我想它能有个美满的家
I want things to be perfect.

1030
01:09:09,620 --> 01:09:14,050
而不是一个像其他支离破碎的家庭
I don't want them to be shitty and broken like everyone else's family.

1031
01:09:15,910 --> 01:09:19,510
听着  我一旦生下这个宝宝  瓦内萨会感到非常开心  
Look, I'll have the baby, and Vanessa is going to be so happy.

1032
01:09:20,440 --> 01:09:22,020
宝宝不是我生活的一切
A baby is not going to fix everything.

1033
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,880
我还未准备好做个父亲
Besides, I don't know if I'm even ready to be a father.

1034
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:26,440
你已经很年长了
But you're old!

1035
01:09:31,090 --> 01:09:32,060
你对我是怎么想的?
How do you think of me?

1036
01:09:33,140 --> 01:09:34,410
为什么你要来这里?
Why are you over here?

1037
01:09:38,130 --> 01:09:39,270
我  
I...

1038
01:09:40,110 --> 01:09:43,440
我只是想成为你另类生活的一部分
I just like being a piece of furniture in your weird life.

1039
01:09:44,800 --> 01:09:48,460
对  这就是我生活的状态
This is what my life has become. I got stuff in boxes.

1040
01:09:48,460 --> 01:09:51,330
被装在箱子里埋在地下  所以你感兴趣了?
I'm underground. That's appealing to you?

1041
01:09:51,750 --> 01:09:52,910
-这是我的错  -不是
- This is my fault. - No.

1042
01:09:53,160 --> 01:09:54,950
瓦内萨是因为我而对你不满吗?
Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?

1043
01:09:55,550 --> 01:09:57,710
与你无关  我和她已经没感觉了
That's got nothing to do with it. Vanessa and I aren't in love anymore.

1044
01:09:58,310 --> 01:10:00,080
如果你不爱她为何要结婚?
You were in love when you married her!

1045
01:10:00,860 --> 01:10:03,130
爱一个人是可以重新认识并相爱的
If you're in love once, you can be in love again.

1046
01:10:03,130 --> 01:10:06,080
像我好友莉亚和同一个人分分合合四次了
My friend Leah has been with the same guy four different times.

1047
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:08,240
你只是不够努力
You're just not trying hard enough.

1048
01:10:08,500 --> 01:10:09,550
你应该责备我这种人
I'm such an idiot. I can't believe what an idiot I am.

1049
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:10,640
不  知道吗  马克?
No, you know what, Mark.

1050
01:10:11,190 --> 01:10:13,310
不要抛弃你的妻子
Do not divorce your wife!

1051
01:10:14,630 --> 01:10:17,890
拜托了  当是做个好心  不要离开瓦内萨
Will you please just do me a solid and stay with Vanessa?

1052
01:10:20,330 --> 01:10:21,170
抱歉  我  
You're so young.

1053
01:10:21,880 --> 01:10:23,280
我没那么小  我都16岁了
I'm not that young. I'm sixteen.

1054
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:26,250
我已懂得分辨什么是混蛋了
I'm old enough to know when someone's acting like a total a- hole!

1055
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:28,300
还有你知道吗?
Oh, and you know what,

1056
01:10:29,410 --> 01:10:32,740
我买了音速青年乐队的另一张专辑  烂掉渣了
I bought another Sonic Youth album and it sucks! It's just noise!

1057
01:10:38,740 --> 01:10:39,940
朱诺  怎么了?
Juno? What's going on?

1058
01:10:41,550 --> 01:10:42,240
没事
Nothing.

1059
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:44,070
你为什么哭?
Why are you crying?

1060
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:47,920
没有哭  我只是对豪华装修敏感
I'm not crying. I'm just allergic to fine home furnishings.

1061
01:10:49,690 --> 01:10:50,400
什么事?
What's the matter?

1062
01:10:51,140 --> 01:10:52,220
怎么了?
What's the matter?

1063
01:10:52,910 --> 01:10:55,460
只是有点情绪波动
She's just a little hormonal. Right, Juno?

1064
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:57,070
怀孕期间的反应
It's part of the process.

1065
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:02,400
你干了什么?
What did you do?

1066
01:11:04,940 --> 01:11:05,840
没什么
I didn't do anything...

1067
01:11:07,980 --> 01:11:08,810
只不过  
Just...

1068
01:11:13,550 --> 01:11:14,400
我一直在想  
I've been thinking.

1069
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:18,190
-什么?  -我一直在想这事是不是合适
- What? - Just thinking if this is the right thing.

1070
01:11:20,170 --> 01:11:21,080
你在胡说什么?
What are you talking about?

1071
01:11:23,230 --> 01:11:24,190
只是在怀疑是否  
Just wondering if it's,

1072
01:11:25,230 --> 01:11:26,010
准备好了
Just wondering if we're ready.

1073
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:28,730
我们准备好了
Yeah, we're ready.

1074
01:11:29,190 --> 01:11:32,180
我们准备好了  我们在上相关课程
We're ready. We've read the books, we've taken all the classes.

1075
01:11:32,180 --> 01:11:34,090
我们还有一个育婴室  
We have a nursery that is completely...

1076
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:39,810
听着  我知道事情安排好了  不过我怀疑自己还没准备好
Vanessa, I know we're prepared. I'm just wondering if... I'm ready.

1077
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:46,030
先等等
Wait a minute.

1078
01:11:46,580 --> 01:11:49,690
朱诺  不要听他的  他只是有点沮丧
Juno, don't listen to him. He's just got cold feet.

1079
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:51,230
他还是个小孩子
He's just being a guy.

1080
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:52,800
书上也说了
The books all say the same thing.

1081
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,810
当女人怀孕了就会成为妈妈
A woman becomes a mother when she gets pregnant.

1082
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:57,400
当男人看到了宝宝出生他就会知道  要成为一个父亲了
A man becomes a father when he sees his baby.

1083
01:11:58,960 --> 01:12:01,410
他会明白的  他做得到的
He's going to get there.

1084
01:12:01,910 --> 01:12:02,780
这一切来得太快了
It just happened so fast.

1085
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,860
我们登了广告  我以为会等好几个月
We put the ad in the paper and I thought it was gonna take months if at all and then,

1086
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,630
然后两周后她就坐在我们沙发上了
Two weeks later, she's on that couch.

1087
01:12:09,160 --> 01:12:10,250
她是上天赐给我们的
She answered our prayers.

1088
01:12:10,550 --> 01:12:13,300
从那时候起  就像个定时的闹钟
Ever since then it's been like a ticking clock.

1089
01:12:17,250 --> 01:12:18,790
你说什么?
What are you saying?

1090
01:12:21,840 --> 01:12:23,440
我觉得是时辰未到
That it feels a little like bad timing.

1091
01:12:27,020 --> 01:12:29,050
那你眼中的好时辰是什么?  马克
What would be a good time for you, Mark?

1092
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,990
等我做完我想做的事情
There's just some things that I still want to do.

1093
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,300
例如什么?  做个摇滚巨星?
Like what? Be a rock star?

1094
01:12:36,880 --> 01:12:37,660
不要取笑我
Don't mock me.

1095
01:12:39,550 --> 01:12:40,570
我只能说这是  
I'm just saying that this is,

1096
01:12:41,900 --> 01:12:43,220
这是永远不会发生的事情
This is something that's never going to happen.

1097
01:12:48,120 --> 01:12:49,080
知道吗  你的衬衫很稚气
Your shirt is stupid.

1098
01:12:50,800 --> 01:12:51,680
你是成年人了
Grow up.

1099
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:54,510
假如要我等你成为科特・柯本(摇滚巨星)
If I have to wait for you to become Kurt Cobain,

1100
01:12:54,510 --> 01:12:55,930
我可能永远做不了妈妈
I'm never going to be a mother.

1101
01:13:00,570 --> 01:13:01,790
我从未说过我是个好爸爸
I never said I'd be a good father.

1102
01:15:58,240 --> 01:16:01,820
我打给吉托・拉斯了  她可以做两人的代表律师
I called Gerta Rauss and she said that she can represent both of us.

1103
01:16:01,820 --> 01:16:03,940
她称做是"合作性离婚"  
It's called a "collaborative divorce. "

1104
01:16:05,520 --> 01:16:06,990
似乎现在很流行这样  
It's all the rage right now, supposedly.

1105
01:16:08,020 --> 01:16:09,660
这应该很容易  因为我们没有孩子
And it would be pretty easy because we don't have any children.

1106
01:16:10,680 --> 01:16:11,850
谢谢你打给她了
Thanks for making the call, I guess.

1107
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:21,160
你找到地方落脚了?
Have you found a place to stay yet?

1108
01:16:22,050 --> 01:16:24,670
-是的  在市中心  -酒店吗?
- Yeah, downtown. - A hotel?

1109
01:16:25,090 --> 01:16:27,180
不是酒店  是个公寓
No, it's not a hotel. It's a loft.

1110
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,380
你还是个酷哥啊
Aren't you the cool guy?

1111
01:16:35,540 --> 01:16:36,740
我太想要个宝宝了
I wanted a baby so bad.

1112
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:39,380
我明白
I know.

1113
01:16:59,520 --> 01:17:01,330
-好象是张帐单  -给我
- It looks like a bill from Jiffy- Lube. - It's for me.

1114
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,290
我从未想过自己有这么想回到家
I never realize how much I like being home unless

1115
01:17:46,290 --> 01:17:48,490
除非是到另一个地方待上很久后
I've been somewhere really different for a while.

1116
01:17:57,750 --> 01:17:58,660
嘿  老爸
Hey, Dad.

1117
01:17:58,980 --> 01:18:00,220
嘿  加大码的朱朱
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug.

1118
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:02,660
你去哪里了?
Where have you been?

1119
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:06,170
我去了处理一些比较大人的事
Dealing with things way beyond my maturity level.

1120
01:18:09,660 --> 01:18:10,660
其他人呢?
Where is everybody?

1121
01:18:11,310 --> 01:18:13,970
布伦带小玛丽去上溜冰课了
Bren took Liberty Bell to her tot ice skating class.

1122
01:18:15,420 --> 01:18:17,890
你们不知道小孩子不能学滑冰吗?
When will you guys learn that tots can't ice skate?

1123
01:18:19,910 --> 01:18:21,200
宝贝  你有点不开心吗?
You're looking a little morose, honey.

1124
01:18:22,160 --> 01:18:23,020
什么事?
What's eating you?

1125
01:18:31,780 --> 01:18:33,970
好象我失去对人性的信心
I'm just, like, losing my faith with humanity.

1126
01:18:35,140 --> 01:18:36,520
你能清晰地告诉我吗?
Can you narrow that down for me?

1127
01:18:38,440 --> 01:18:39,270
我只是  
I just...

1128
01:18:39,690 --> 01:18:40,550
怀疑  
...wonder if...

1129
01:18:42,280 --> 01:18:44,220
两个人在一起生活是否合适
...two people can stay together for good.

1130
01:18:45,810 --> 01:18:46,720
你是说夫妻?
You mean like couples?

1131
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:47,920
对  或是  
Yeah, like,

1132
01:18:48,370 --> 01:18:49,420
相爱的两个人
People in love.

1133
01:18:51,050 --> 01:18:53,200
你遇到感情上的问题了?
Are you having boy trouble 'cause I gotta be honest;

1134
01:18:53,200 --> 01:18:55,670
因为我不确定你现在适合去约会
I don't really much approve of you dating in your condition,

1135
01:18:56,690 --> 01:18:58,000
那不是很好
That's kind of messed up.

1136
01:18:58,120 --> 01:18:58,960
不  不是这样爸爸  
No, dad!

1137
01:18:59,600 --> 01:19:00,500
这有点猥亵感觉
I mean, that's pretty skanky.

1138
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:02,750
像你们女孩子说的"猥亵"
Isn't that what you girls call it? Skanky? Skeevy?

1139
01:19:02,820 --> 01:19:04,060
不要说了
Please stop.

1140
01:19:04,400 --> 01:19:05,210
嗑药嗑疯了?
Tore up from the floor up?

1141
01:19:05,640 --> 01:19:07,600
不是这个啦
That's not what it's about.

1142
01:19:11,830 --> 01:19:18,260
我只是  想知道两个人  是否能开心地白头到老
I just need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever.

1143
01:19:19,870 --> 01:19:21,130
我敢说不容易就对了
It's not easy, that's for sure.

1144
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:25,670
也许我不是个好的榜样  不过  
I don't have the best track record in the world, I know, but,

1145
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,740
我已经和你后妈生活10年了  我不敢说  
I've been with your stepmother for ten years now,

1146
01:19:29,850 --> 01:19:31,180
我们生活得很美满愉快
and I'm proud to say that we're very happy.

1147
01:19:33,570 --> 01:19:34,430
听着  
Look...

1148
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:36,760
我是这样认为的  
...In my opinion...

1149
01:19:37,560 --> 01:19:43,230
最好是找一个爱着你  就因为你是朱诺的人
The best thing you can do is find a person who loves you for exactly what you are.

1150
01:19:45,100 --> 01:19:47,960
开心  伤心  丑陋  美丽
Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty,

1151
01:19:48,810 --> 01:19:50,370
帅气  什么也好
Handsome, what have you,

1152
01:19:52,180 --> 01:19:54,490
总之对的那个人会觉得  你放的屁也是香的
the right person is still gonna think the sun shines out of your ass.

1153
01:19:58,450 --> 01:19:59,820
那个人才是我们  该与之厮守一生的
That's the kind of person that's worth sticking with.

1154
01:20:01,460 --> 01:20:02,060
没错
Yeah.

1155
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:08,150
我想我已经遇到那个人了
I think I've found that person.

1156
01:20:09,240 --> 01:20:10,620
当然找到了  那就"D-A-D"  爸爸啊
Yeah, sure you have. Your old D- A- D!

1157
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:14,360
我会永远爱你支持你
You know I'll always be there to love you, support you,

1158
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,760
无论你闯了什么大祸
no matter what kind of pickle you're in.

1159
01:20:17,650 --> 01:20:18,630
绝对会
Obviously.

1160
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:24,850
爸爸  我想要去  
Dad, I think i'm just gonna,

1161
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:27,380
去外面一会  不过  
shove out for a sec, but,

1162
01:20:28,070 --> 01:20:29,340
应该很迟回来
I won't be home late.

1163
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:30,770
好
Okay.

1164
01:20:32,100 --> 01:20:33,270
你说的那个人是我对吗?
You were talking about me, right?

1165
01:20:34,550 --> 01:20:35,270
对  没错
Oh, yeah.

1166
01:20:59,170 --> 01:21:01,950
里克  看看信箱

1167
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:32,850
你好
Hi.

1168
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,710
是你把100多盒  跳跳糖放进我信箱的吗?
Did you put like a hundred things of tic tacs in my mailbox?

1169
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,710
对  那人是我
Oh, yeah, that was me.

1170
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:41,900
为什么?
Why?

1171
01:21:42,290 --> 01:21:43,700
你知道  是你的最爱啊  
They're your fave.

1172
01:21:44,460 --> 01:21:47,370
你永远都吃不厌那糖  所以我就  
You can never have too many of your favorite one- calorie breath mint.

1173
01:21:48,200 --> 01:21:50,180
那谢谢你了  
Yeah, well thanks, I...

1174
01:21:50,420 --> 01:21:53,320
我想那些糖够我吃到上大学了
I think I'm pretty much set until college on the tic tac front.

1175
01:21:54,680 --> 01:21:55,870
里克  知道吗?  我一直在想  
You know, Bleek, I was thinking.

1176
01:21:56,420 --> 01:22:00,180
我不该那么凶对你  不是你的错
I'm sorry I was such a huge bitch to you. You don't deserve it.

1177
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:03,530
没所谓  你知道
It's okay.

1178
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:06,260
还有  
Also,

1179
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:09,690
我想我爱上你了
I think I'm in love with you.

1180
01:22:12,410 --> 01:22:13,630
你在开玩笑吗?
What, you mean as friends?

1181
01:22:14,480 --> 01:22:15,200
不
No.

1182
01:22:16,280 --> 01:22:17,410
我是说实话
I mean, for real.

1183
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:21,720
因为你是我认识最酷的人
Because you're, like, the coolest person I've ever met.

1184
01:22:22,390 --> 01:22:24,220
而且你也没故意表现出来  
And you don't even have to try.

1185
01:22:26,800 --> 01:22:28,130
其实我一直很努力表现  
I try really hard, actually.

1186
01:22:28,580 --> 01:22:29,980
你单纯而聪明
You're, like, naturally smart.

1187
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:32,220
你和其他人不一样
You're not like everyone else.

1188
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:35,370
你一直看的是我的脸而不是肚子
You don't stare at my stomach all the time, you look at my face.

1189
01:22:36,050 --> 01:22:41,690
我看着你  宝宝就会踢我很厉害
And every time I see you, the baby starts kicking super hard.

1190
01:22:42,720 --> 01:22:43,830
真的?
It does?

1191
01:22:56,500 --> 01:22:59,020
我想是因为每次  我看你都心跳加快
I think it's because my heart starts pounding everytime I see you.

1192
01:23:00,590 --> 01:23:01,420
我也一样
Mine too.

1193
01:23:04,340 --> 01:23:06,050
这也是我从你那里得到的最大安慰了
That's all I could ask for.

1194
01:23:09,590 --> 01:23:10,620
黄金猛男
You're golden, man.

1195
01:23:13,950 --> 01:23:15,530
我们现在可以来吗?
Can we make out now?

1196
01:23:16,980 --> 01:23:18,190
可以
Yeah.

1197
01:23:30,530 --> 01:23:34,180
嘿  知道吗?  你们这样  脸贴脸可能会导致早产
You know, you can go into early labor sucking face like that!

1198
01:23:58,330 --> 01:23:59,330
爸爸!
Dad!

1199
01:24:00,410 --> 01:24:01,230
什么事?
What?

1200
01:24:02,100 --> 01:24:04,020
如果我不是尿床了  那就是  
Dad, either I just peed my pants or...

1201
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,760
那就是?
Or?

1202
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:09,510
"雷猫跑车"要冲出来了
Thundercats are go!

1203
01:24:09,870 --> 01:24:10,610
快点快点
All out, all out!

1204
01:24:11,840 --> 01:24:12,830
你带了需要的东西了吗?
Do you have the admittance form?

1205
01:24:13,180 --> 01:24:14,670
没东西落下吧?
What about the parking stickers?

1206
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:15,940
带好Liberty Bell
Have you got Liberty Bell?

1207
01:24:16,130 --> 01:24:18,160
忘记小玛丽了!
Oh, sweetie, sweetie!

1208
01:24:22,010 --> 01:24:22,870
我们走
Here we go.

1209
01:24:26,210 --> 01:24:27,570
快点  开车吧!
Hurry! Start the car, go!

1210
01:24:28,190 --> 01:24:29,410
爸爸
Gas!

1211
01:24:33,800 --> 01:24:36,180
-别这样  停下  -但这很有趣!
- Wait, wait! - Out of the way!

1212
01:24:39,900 --> 01:24:41,230
-不要这样  -为什么?
- Don't do that. - What?

1213
01:24:41,610 --> 01:24:43,190
-你们在疯什么?  -宝宝要出生了!
- That. - But it's fun!

1214
01:24:45,830 --> 01:24:47,660
怎么觉得是在做脊椎穿刺?
Bren, when do I get that friggin' Spinal Tap thing?

1215
01:24:48,410 --> 01:24:50,990
叫做脊髓阻滞  医生说你还不能生产
It's called a spinal block, and you can't have it yet, honey.

1216
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:52,820
因为你还没有足够的张开度
The doctor said you're not dilated enough.

1217
01:24:53,290 --> 01:24:55,920
噢  去他的!  我感觉更难受了
Come on! I have to wait for it to get worse?

1218
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:58,600
我只想快点处理完
Why can't I just have the friggin' thing now?

1219
01:24:59,290 --> 01:25:00,770
宝贝  医生就是虐待狂
Honey, doctors are sadists

1220
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:02,980
就喜欢跟上帝对着干  就喜欢看小孩大喊大叫
who like to play God and watch lesser people scream.

1221
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:04,990
噢  靠!
Oh, shit.

1222
01:25:05,690 --> 01:25:09,070
抱歉  能不能现在给孩子做脊椎穿刺?
Excuse me! Can we give my kid the damn spinal tap already?

1223
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:39,600
然后  
And then...

1224
01:25:41,520 --> 01:25:42,910
我不知道从哪里
out of nowhere...

1225
01:25:43,150 --> 01:25:43,940
出来了  
...there it was...

1226
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:46,890
他出生了  
There he was.

1227
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,230
我决定不告诉里克我要生了
I decided not to call Bleeker to tell him that I was having the baby.

1228
01:25:56,910 --> 01:26:01,000
他正要参加一项大比赛  我不想让他分心
He had a big meet against Manteno and I didn't want him to get all worried about me.

1229
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:07,870
不过他还是感觉到了
But he figured it out anyway.

1230
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:27,500
某天你会再回来的  宝贝
Someday you'll be back here, honey.

1231
01:26:30,290 --> 01:26:31,330
以你的名义
On your terms.

1232
01:26:43,810 --> 01:26:44,890
嗨
Hey.

1233
01:26:45,650 --> 01:26:47,620
谢谢你来了
Nice legs.

1234
01:27:29,440 --> 01:27:31,090
里克决定不去看宝宝
Bleeker decided he didn't want to see the baby.

1235
01:27:33,000 --> 01:27:35,970
我也是  我们觉得他不是属于我们的
Neither did I, really. He didn't feel like ours.

1236
01:27:43,510 --> 01:27:45,190
我想应该是属于她的
I think he was always hers.

1237
01:27:49,970 --> 01:27:51,390
你要看看你儿子吗?
Would you like to meet your son?

1238
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,620
我有个儿子了
I have a son?

1239
01:28:23,780 --> 01:28:24,590
我看起来怎样?
How do I look?

1240
01:28:26,360 --> 01:28:27,200
一个真正的妈妈
Like a new mom.

1241
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:29,240
担心又爱怜的妈妈
Scared shitless.

1242
01:28:55,360 --> 01:28:56,820
然后又以一张椅子结束了
It ended with a chair.

1243
01:29:00,430 --> 01:29:07,490
致瓦内萨:
如果你还坚持  那我也是一样--朱诺

1244
01:29:25,140 --> 01:29:29,250
夏天来了

1245
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:56,390
保利・里克作为我的男友是我的一切
As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally boss.

1246
01:29:56,390 --> 01:29:59,090
就像通心粉里面的芝士般重要
He is the cheese to my macaroni.

1247
01:30:01,480 --> 01:30:04,140
我知道人们一般是先恋爱再生育
I know people are supposed to fall in love before they reproduce, but,

1248
01:30:05,340 --> 01:30:06,950
我自知不是个循规蹈矩的人  那不是我的风格
I guess normalcy's not really our style.

1249
01:30:14,170 --> 01:30:14,870
嘿
Hey.

1250
01:30:15,390 --> 01:30:16,590
嘿
Hey.

1251
01:30:21,400 --> 01:30:22,230
准备好了?
Ready?

1252
01:30:22,650 --> 01:30:23,870
是的
Yeah.

1253
01:30:35,250 --> 01:30:42,340
You're a part time lover and a full time friend 
The monkey on you're back is the latest trend

1254
01:30:42,350 --> 01:30:48,340
I don't see what anyone can see 
in anyone else...But you...

1255
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:55,340
Here is the church and here is the steeple 
We sure are cute for two ugly people

1256
01:30:55,350 --> 01:31:01,340
I don't see what anyone can see 
in anyone else...But you...

1257
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:08,340
We both have shiny happy fits of rage 
You want more fans, I want more stage

1258
01:31:08,350 --> 01:31:14,340
I don't see what anyone can see 
in anyone else...But you...

1259
01:31:14,350 --> 01:31:21,340
You are always trying to keep it real 
I'm in love with how you feel

1260
01:31:21,350 --> 01:31:27,340
I don't see what anyone can see 
in anyone else...But you...

1261
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:30,260
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train

1262
01:31:30,260 --> 01:31:34,340
I kiss you all starry eyed, my body's swinging from side to side

1263
01:31:34,350 --> 01:31:40,340
I don't see what anyone can see 
in anyone else...But you...

1264
01:31:40,350 --> 01:31:47,340
The pebbles forgive me the trees forgive me 
So why can't, you forgive me?

1265
01:31:47,350 --> 01:31:54,340
I don't see what anyone can see 
in anyone else...But you...

1266
01:31:54,350 --> 01:32:00,340
Du du du du du du du du 
Du du du du du du du du

1267
01:32:00,350 --> 01:32:07,340
I don't see what anyone can see
in anyone else...But you...
