1
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,588
<i>It started with a chair.</i>

2
00:00:48,656 --> 00:00:51,591
Once

3
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,356
I loved

4
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:59,161
And I gave so much love
to this love

5
00:00:59,234 --> 00:01:03,102
It was the world to me

6
00:01:03,171 --> 00:01:05,230
Once

7
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:09,766
I cried

8
00:01:09,844 --> 00:01:12,779
At the thought
I was foolish and proud

9
00:01:12,847 --> 00:01:14,781
And let you say good-bye

10
00:01:14,849 --> 00:01:16,942
I've wanted this
for a really long time.

11
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,554
I know.

12
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:23,056
Wizard...

13
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,525
From my infinite sadness
you came...

14
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:32,899
Geez, Banana,
shut your friggin' gob, okay?!

15
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:38,671
<i>This is the most magnificent</i>
<i>discarded living room set</i>

16
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,173
<i>I've ever seen.</i>

17
00:01:44,145 --> 00:01:46,705
If I was a flower
growing wild and free

18
00:01:46,781 --> 00:01:49,375
All I'd want is you to be
my sweet honeybee

19
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:51,884
And if I was a tree
growing tall and green

20
00:01:51,953 --> 00:01:55,047
All I'd want is you
to shade me and be my leaves

21
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,694
If I was a flower
growing wild and free

22
00:02:10,772 --> 00:02:13,366
All I'd want is you to be
my sweet honeybee

23
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:15,932
And if I was a tree
growing tall and green

24
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:18,877
All I'd want is you
to shade me and be my leaves

25
00:02:20,415 --> 00:02:23,646
All I want is you,
will you be my bride?

26
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:26,016
Take me by the hand
and stand by my side?

27
00:02:26,087 --> 00:02:29,147
All I want is you,
will you stay with me?

28
00:02:29,223 --> 00:02:32,420
Hold me in your arms
and sway me like the sea

29
00:02:46,174 --> 00:02:49,302
If you were a river
and the mountains tall

30
00:02:49,377 --> 00:02:51,311
The rumble of your water
would be my call

31
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:53,939
If you were the winter,
I know I'd be the snow

32
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:56,575
Just as long as you were with
me when the cold winds blow

33
00:02:56,651 --> 00:02:59,643
All I want is you,
will you be my bride?

34
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,349
Take me by the hand
and stand by my side?

35
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:05,221
All I want is you,
will you stay with me?

36
00:03:05,293 --> 00:03:08,592
Hold me in your arms
and sway me like the sea

37
00:03:09,931 --> 00:03:12,331
If you were a wink,
I'd be a nod

38
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,834
If you were a seed,
well, I'd be a pod

39
00:03:14,902 --> 00:03:17,530
If you were a floor,
I'd want to be the rug

40
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:19,869
And if you were a kiss,
I know I'd be a hug

41
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:23,672
All I want is you,
will you be my bride?

42
00:03:23,745 --> 00:03:25,542
Take me by the hand
and stand by my side

43
00:03:25,613 --> 00:03:27,979
All I want is you,
will you stay with me?

44
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,748
Hold me in your arms
and sway me like the sea

45
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:35,311
If you were the wood,
I'd be the fire

46
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:38,086
If you were the love,
I'd be the desire

47
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,525
If you were a castle,
I'd be your moat

48
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,257
And if you were an ocean,
I'd learn to float

49
00:03:43,331 --> 00:03:45,799
All I want is you,
will you be my bride?

50
00:03:45,867 --> 00:03:48,267
Take me by the hand
and stand by my side

51
00:03:48,336 --> 00:03:51,203
All I want is you,
will you stay with me?

52
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,934
Hold me in your arms
and sway me like the sea.

53
00:04:10,024 --> 00:04:13,357
Well, well, if it isn't
MacGuff the crime dog.

54
00:04:13,428 --> 00:04:15,089
Back for another test?

55
00:04:16,764 --> 00:04:18,163
I think the first one was defective.

56
00:04:18,232 --> 00:04:20,166
The plus sign looks more like
a division symbol,

57
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:23,032
so I remain unconvinced.

58
00:04:23,104 --> 00:04:25,299
Third test today, mama bear.

59
00:04:25,373 --> 00:04:28,206
Your Eggo is prego,
no doubt about it.

60
00:04:28,276 --> 00:04:29,538
It's really easy to tell.

61
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,168
Is your nipples real brown?

62
00:04:31,245 --> 00:04:33,008
Yeah, maybe your
little boyfriend's

63
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,378
got mutant sperms;
knocked you up twice.

64
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:36,940
<i>Silencio,</i> old man!

65
00:04:37,018 --> 00:04:39,509
Look, I just drank my weight
in SunnyD

66
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:40,747
and I got to go pronto.

67
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,586
Well, you know where
the lavatory is.

68
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:47,626
And pay for that pee stick
when you're done.

69
00:04:47,695 --> 00:04:49,720
Don't think it's yours
just 'cause you marked it

70
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:51,025
with your urine.

71
00:05:19,927 --> 00:05:22,521
What's the prognosis,
fertile Myrtle?

72
00:05:22,597 --> 00:05:23,859
Minus or plus?

73
00:05:23,931 --> 00:05:26,661
I don't know.
It's not seasoned yet.

74
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:28,634
Take some of these.

75
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:35,099
No, there it is.

76
00:05:35,176 --> 00:05:38,976
God, that little pink
plus sign is so unholy.

77
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:42,106
That ain't no Etch A Sketch.

78
00:05:42,183 --> 00:05:45,414
This is one doodle that
can't be undid, home skillet.

79
00:05:53,261 --> 00:05:57,288
I took the Polaroid
down in my room

80
00:05:57,365 --> 00:06:01,426
I'm pretty sure
you have a new girlfriend

81
00:06:01,502 --> 00:06:05,097
It's not as if
I don't like you

82
00:06:05,172 --> 00:06:09,666
It just makes me sad
whenever I see it

83
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:13,874
'Cause I like to be gone
most of the time

84
00:06:13,948 --> 00:06:18,146
And you like to be home
most of the time

85
00:06:18,219 --> 00:06:21,916
If I stay in one place,
I lose my mind

86
00:06:21,989 --> 00:06:26,756
I'm a pretty impossible
lady to be with

87
00:06:26,827 --> 00:06:30,661
Joey never met a bike
that he didn't want to ride

88
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:34,633
And I never met a Toby
that I didn't like

89
00:06:34,702 --> 00:06:39,662
Scotty liked all of the books
that I recommended

90
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,073
Even if he didn't,
I wouldn't be offended

91
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:55,146
I had a dream that I had
to drive to Madison

92
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:57,122
To deliver a painting

93
00:06:57,358 --> 00:06:59,485
For some silly reason

94
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,052
I took a wrong turn
and ended up in Michigan...

95
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:08,697
Yo, yo, yo-giddy, yo.

96
00:07:08,769 --> 00:07:10,293
I'm a suicide risk.

97
00:07:10,371 --> 00:07:11,702
Juno?

98
00:07:11,772 --> 00:07:13,000
No, it's Morgan Freeman.

99
00:07:13,074 --> 00:07:15,042
Do you have any bones
that need collecting?

100
00:07:15,109 --> 00:07:16,838
Only the one in my pants.

101
00:07:18,179 --> 00:07:20,238
I'm pregnant.

102
00:07:20,314 --> 00:07:22,407
What?! Honest to blog?

103
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:24,383
Yeah. Yeah, it's Bleeker's.

104
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:26,420
It's probably just a food baby.

105
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,478
Did you have a big lunch?

106
00:07:28,556 --> 00:07:30,421
No, this is not a food baby,
all right?

107
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,856
I've taken, like,
three pregnancy tests,

108
00:07:31,926 --> 00:07:34,417
and I am for shiz up the spout.

109
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,259
How did you even generate
enough pee

110
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,764
for three pregnancy tests?

111
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,232
That's amazing.

112
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:42,997
I don't know. I drank, like,
ten tons of SunnyD.

113
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:45,630
Anyway, dude,
I'm telling you I'm pregnant,

114
00:07:45,706 --> 00:07:48,106
and you're acting
shockingly cavalier.

115
00:07:48,175 --> 00:07:50,837
Is this for real?
Like, for real for real?

116
00:07:50,911 --> 00:07:52,936
Unfortunately, yes.

117
00:07:54,982 --> 00:07:56,279
Oh, my God!

118
00:07:56,350 --> 00:07:57,749
Oh, shit!

119
00:07:57,818 --> 00:07:58,876
Phuket, Thailand.

120
00:07:58,953 --> 00:08:00,045
There we go.

121
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:01,349
That was kind of the emotion

122
00:08:01,422 --> 00:08:03,447
that I was searching for
on the first take.

123
00:08:03,524 --> 00:08:05,355
So, are you going to go
to Havenbrook or Women Now?

124
00:08:05,426 --> 00:08:07,053
'Cause you know you need a note
from your parents

125
00:08:07,128 --> 00:08:08,425
for Havenbrook.

126
00:08:08,496 --> 00:08:11,329
Yeah, I-I know, um...
no, I'm going to go to Women Now

127
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,458
just 'cause they help out women now.

128
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:14,899
Hey, do you want me to call for you?

129
00:08:14,969 --> 00:08:16,266
'Cause I called for Becky last year.

130
00:08:16,337 --> 00:08:17,395
No, I can call myself.

131
00:08:17,471 --> 00:08:19,336
Oh, but I do need your help
with something.

132
00:08:19,407 --> 00:08:20,431
It's, like, critically important.

133
00:08:21,842 --> 00:08:23,969
You know, heavy lifting
can really only help you

134
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:25,307
at this point.

135
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,607
Seriously.

136
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:28,444
So you were bored?

137
00:08:28,516 --> 00:08:30,177
That's how this blessed
miracle came to be?

138
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:31,980
No. No, no.
The act was premeditated.

139
00:08:32,053 --> 00:08:33,145
I mean, the sex,

140
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,450
not the whole, like,
let's-get-pregnant thing.

141
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:38,356
So, when did you decide

142
00:08:38,426 --> 00:08:40,724
that you were going
to, uh, do Bleeker?

143
00:08:40,795 --> 00:08:44,162
Well, like...

144
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:47,632
<i>a year ago in Spanish class.</i>

145
00:08:47,702 --> 00:08:49,226
Besame mucho.

146
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:50,565
You love him.

147
00:08:52,139 --> 00:08:54,266
It's... no, it's actually,

148
00:08:54,341 --> 00:08:56,309
it's really complicated, okay?

149
00:08:56,377 --> 00:09:00,643
And I don't feel like talking
about it in my fragile state.

150
00:09:00,715 --> 00:09:05,084
So what was it like
humping Bleek's bony bod?

151
00:09:05,152 --> 00:09:07,586
Magnificent.

152
00:09:09,623 --> 00:09:12,717
'Cause he gets up
in the morning

153
00:09:12,793 --> 00:09:15,785
And he goes to work at 9:00

154
00:09:15,863 --> 00:09:18,627
And he comes back home
at 5:30

155
00:09:18,699 --> 00:09:21,099
Gets the same train
every time

156
00:09:21,168 --> 00:09:25,264
'Cause his world is built
on punctuality

157
00:09:25,339 --> 00:09:28,035
It never fails

158
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,270
And he's, oh, so good

159
00:09:30,344 --> 00:09:33,245
And he's, oh, so fine

160
00:09:33,314 --> 00:09:38,946
And he's, oh, so healthy
in his body and his mind

161
00:09:39,019 --> 00:09:42,716
He's a well-respected man
about town

162
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:44,849
Doing the best things
so conservatively.

163
00:09:44,925 --> 00:09:48,292
Hey, Bleek.

164
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:50,193
Wicked tiger.

165
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:51,891
He looks proud.

166
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:54,833
I swiped it
from Miss Ransick's lawn.

167
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:59,635
Wow, your shorts are, like,
especially gold today.

168
00:09:59,707 --> 00:10:01,299
My mom uses colorsafe bleach.

169
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,036
Go, Carol.

170
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,704
I'll tell her.

171
00:10:08,382 --> 00:10:11,044
<i>When I see them all</i>
<i>running like that</i>

172
00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:13,143
<i>with their things bouncing</i>
<i>around in their shorts,</i>

173
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,654
<i>I always picture them naked</i>
<i>even if I don't want to.</i>

174
00:10:15,723 --> 00:10:18,692
<i>All I see is pork swords.</i>

175
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,920
I'm supposed to be running.

176
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,986
So guess what?

177
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:25,691
What? I don't know.

178
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,895
I'm pregnant.

179
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:42,849
What should we do...
about...?

180
00:10:42,917 --> 00:10:46,045
Well, you know, I was just...

181
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,588
I was thinking I'd just
nip it in the bud

182
00:10:48,656 --> 00:10:50,556
before it gets worse.

183
00:10:50,624 --> 00:10:52,489
'Cause they were talking about,
in health class,

184
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,724
how pregnancy, it can often
lead to an infant.

185
00:10:56,797 --> 00:10:58,697
Typically, yeah, yeah.

186
00:10:58,766 --> 00:11:02,167
That's what happens when our
moms and teachers get pregnant.

187
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:07,266
So you're cool with that then?

188
00:11:07,341 --> 00:11:09,901
Yeah, yeah, Wizard,
I mean, you know, just,

189
00:11:09,977 --> 00:11:13,344
I guess do whatever you think
you should do, you know?

190
00:11:18,285 --> 00:11:19,980
Well, I'm sorry I had sex with you.

191
00:11:21,522 --> 00:11:23,387
I know it wasn't, like, your idea.

192
00:11:23,457 --> 00:11:26,255
Whose idea was it?

193
00:11:26,327 --> 00:11:29,194
I'll see you at school, all right?

194
00:11:32,266 --> 00:11:34,496
Whose idea was it?

195
00:12:00,327 --> 00:12:01,919
Your book feel apart.

196
00:12:01,996 --> 00:12:03,520
Right.

197
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:05,189
Must have looked at your face.

198
00:12:07,701 --> 00:12:11,330
<i>The funny thing is that Steve</i>
<i>Rendazo secretly wants me.</i>

199
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:13,965
<i>Jocks like him always want</i>
<i>freaky girls</i>?

200
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,737
<i>girls with horn-rimmed glasses,</i>
<i>and vegan footwear,</i>

201
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,540
<i>and Goth makeup...</i>

202
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,844
<i>Girls who, like, play the cello</i>
<i>and read McSweeney's</i>

203
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:25,477

<i>librarians when they grow up.</i>

204
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:28,146
<i>Oh, yeah, jocks totally</i>
<i>eat that shit up.</i>

205
00:12:28,222 --> 00:12:30,019
<i>Theyjust won't admit it</i>
<i>because they're supposed to be</i>

206
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:32,456
<i>into, like, the perfect</i>
<i>cheerleaders, you know?</i>

207
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:35,518
<i>Like Leah, who, incidentally,</i>
<i>is into teachers.</i>

208
00:12:35,596 --> 00:12:36,722
Me, too!

209
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,095
I love Woody Allen.

210
00:12:40,701 --> 00:12:42,430
All right, all right.

211
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:43,970
All right, people,

212
00:12:44,038 --> 00:12:46,905
we're doing
chromatography lab today.

213
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,272
So find your partners
and break into groups of four.

214
00:12:54,214 --> 00:12:56,774
Well, there's nothing
like experimenting.

215
00:12:58,052 --> 00:12:59,349
Um, I did

216
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:00,944
the prep questions for
this lab last night.

217
00:13:01,021 --> 00:13:02,921
So you can just copy
my answers if you...

218
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:04,252
Oh, I couldn't copy your work.

219
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,724
You copy my work every week.

220
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:07,761
True. I'm kind of a deadbeat
lab partner, aren't I?

221
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,193
No, I don't mind.

222
00:13:09,263 --> 00:13:10,662
I think you definitely
bring something to the table.

223
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:12,631
Charisma.

224
00:13:13,634 --> 00:13:14,658
So who's ready

225
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:16,532
for some chromo-magnificence?

226
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:17,831
Yeah, I have
a menstrual migraine,

227
00:13:17,905 --> 00:13:19,770
so I can't really look at
bright lights today.

228
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,535
Amanda,
I told you to go

229
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:22,768
to the infirmary and lie down.

230
00:13:22,843 --> 00:13:24,071
You never listen.

231
00:13:24,144 --> 00:13:26,009
No, Josh, because
I don't take orders,

232
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,412
-not from you and not from any man.
-You've been acting

233
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:29,676
like this ever since I got back

234
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,377
from visiting my brother in Mankato.

235
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:33,511
I already told you,
nothing happened.

236
00:13:33,587 --> 00:13:35,521
Well, I'm gonna set
up the apparatus.

237
00:13:35,589 --> 00:13:37,853
Um, Juno, do you want to
plug in the Bunsen burner?

238
00:13:37,925 --> 00:13:39,893
-It's my pleasure.
-I'm going to the infirmary.

239
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,689
Good. Call me when
you get off the rag.

240
00:13:41,762 --> 00:13:43,696
Fine. Call me when you
learn how to love someone

241
00:13:43,764 --> 00:13:45,288
instead of cheat at
your brother's college

242
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,856
just because you had
four Smirnoff Ices

243
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:49,562
and a bottle of snow peak
peach flavored Boone's.

244
00:13:49,636 --> 00:13:51,103
Good, Amanda,
I'll be sure to do that.

245
00:13:51,171 --> 00:13:53,036
I'll make a note of it.

246
00:13:54,174 --> 00:13:55,436
I've actually
heard that

247
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,306
the snow peak peach flavor

248
00:13:57,378 --> 00:13:59,437
is the best flavor of Boone's.

249
00:14:00,647 --> 00:14:03,172
Isn't that right, Bleek?

250
00:14:15,929 --> 00:14:19,592
<i>Oprima el número dos.</i>

251
00:14:24,338 --> 00:14:26,033
Hey, yeah, um,

252
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:29,564
l-I'm just calling to procure
a hasty abortion.

253
00:14:29,643 --> 00:14:31,941
What?

254
00:14:32,012 --> 00:14:33,604
Can you just hold on for a second?

255
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,443
I'm on my hamburger phone.

256
00:14:39,386 --> 00:14:41,377
Y... okay, yeah, now I can...

257
00:14:41,455 --> 00:14:44,219
Yeah, it's just, like,
really awkward to talk on.

258
00:14:44,291 --> 00:14:45,383
Um...

259
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:46,892
Yeah, yeah, I...

260
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,485
I-I need an abortion.

261
00:14:49,563 --> 00:14:51,724
Sixteen.

262
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,960
I'm gonna say it's been about, um...

263
00:14:54,034 --> 00:14:57,060
two months and four days
since <i>the</i> sex.

264
00:14:57,137 --> 00:15:00,106
Mind you, that's just, like,
a guesstimation.

265
00:15:02,743 --> 00:15:04,574
Sorry, how long have I been what?

266
00:15:04,645 --> 00:15:07,808
<i>Ugh, I hate it when adults use</i>
<i>the term "sexually active."</i>

267
00:15:07,881 --> 00:15:09,246
<i>What does it even mean?</i>

268
00:15:09,316 --> 00:15:10,783
<i>That I, like, deactivate someday?</i>

269
00:15:10,851 --> 00:15:13,319
<i>Or is this some sort of</i>
<i>permanent state ofbeing?</i>

270
00:15:13,387 --> 00:15:15,184
<i>I guess Bleeker went live</i>
<i>that night we did it, I guess,</i>

271
00:15:15,255 --> 00:15:17,951
<i>and that's why he got</i>
<i>that look on his face.</i>

272
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:21,017
Should've seen this
octopus furnace at work.

273
00:15:21,095 --> 00:15:24,656
I had to get on my Hazmat suit
just to get into the thing.

274
00:15:24,731 --> 00:15:26,096
<i>My dad used to be in the army,</i>

275
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,657
<i>but now he's just your average</i>
<i>H-VAC specialist.</i>

276
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:30,498
<i>He and my mom got divorced</i>
<i>when I was, like, five</i>

277
00:15:30,571 --> 00:15:32,004
<i>and she lives on a Havasu</i>
<i>reservation in Arizona</i>

278
00:15:32,072 --> 00:15:35,701
<i>with her new husband</i>
<i>and three replacement kids.</i>

279
00:15:35,776 --> 00:15:37,937
<i>Oh, and she inexplicably</i>
<i>mails me a cactus</i>

280
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:39,308
<i>every Valentine's Day.</i>

281
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:41,347
<i>And I'm like,</i>
<i>"Thanks a heap, coyote ugly.</i>

282
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:44,509
<i>This cactus-gram stings even</i>
<i>worse than your abandonment. "</i>

283
00:15:45,619 --> 00:15:47,644
<i>That's my stepmom, Bren.</i>

284
00:15:47,721 --> 00:15:49,586
<i>She's completely</i>
<i>obsessed with dogs,</i>

285
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:50,850
<i>owns a nail salon</i>

286
00:15:50,924 --> 00:15:53,893
<i>and always smells like</i>
<i>methyl methacrylate.</i>

287
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:56,452
So, Juno, how was your
little maneuver last night?

288
00:15:56,530 --> 00:15:57,690
Which maneuver, sir?

289
00:15:57,764 --> 00:15:59,595
The one where I move
an entire living room set

290
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,601
from one lawn to the other
or the one where I downed

291
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:04,864
a 64-ounce blue Slushee
in ten minutes.

292
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:06,098
Juno,

293
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,300
did you by any chance
barf in my urn?

294
00:16:11,578 --> 00:16:13,011
Mac, you know that nice urn
by the front door,

295
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,172
the one I got up in Stillwater?

296
00:16:14,248 --> 00:16:15,272
Mm-hmm.

297
00:16:15,349 --> 00:16:16,407
There was some blue shit...

298
00:16:16,483 --> 00:16:17,507
I mean, gunk,

299
00:16:17,584 --> 00:16:19,779
stuff in there this morning.

300
00:16:20,988 --> 00:16:23,786
I would never barf
in your urn, Brenda.

301
00:16:24,825 --> 00:16:27,123
I mean, maybe LB did it.

302
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:29,887
Liberty Bell,
if you put

303
00:16:29,963 --> 00:16:31,294
one more Bac-O on that potato,

304
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:33,128
I'm gonna kick
your little monkey butt.

305
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:38,264
All babies want to get borned.

306
00:16:38,338 --> 00:16:39,430
All babies

307
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:41,030
want to get borned.

308
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:43,508
All babies want to get borned.

309
00:16:43,577 --> 00:16:44,566
All...

310
00:16:45,679 --> 00:16:47,579
Hey, Su-Chin.

311
00:16:47,648 --> 00:16:48,808
Oh. Hi, Juno.

312
00:16:48,882 --> 00:16:49,940
How are you?

313
00:16:50,017 --> 00:16:52,383
You know, pretty solid.

314
00:16:52,452 --> 00:16:54,147
Um...

315
00:16:54,221 --> 00:16:55,950
So, did you... did
you write that paper

316
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:57,615
for Worth's class yet?

317
00:16:57,691 --> 00:16:59,750
No, not yet.

318
00:16:59,826 --> 00:17:01,418
I tried to work on it
a little last night,

319
00:17:01,495 --> 00:17:03,258
but I'm having trouble
concentrating.

320
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,389
Oh, well, I'll sell you some
of my Adderall, if you...

321
00:17:05,465 --> 00:17:06,591
No, thanks.

322
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:07,827
I'm off pills.

323
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:08,925
It's a wise choice.

324
00:17:09,002 --> 00:17:09,991
'Cause I knew this girl,

325
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:11,799
she had this, like,
crazy freak-out

326
00:17:11,872 --> 00:17:14,067
'cause she took too many
behavioral meds at once.

327
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:16,166
And she just, like,
ripped off her clothes

328
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:18,734
and dove into the fountain
at Ridgedale mall,

329
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:23,215
and was like, "Bligh, I'm
a kraken from the sea!"

330
00:17:24,484 --> 00:17:26,611
I heard that was you.

331
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:30,420
Well, it's good seeing you, Su-Chin.

332
00:17:33,293 --> 00:17:36,160
Your baby probably has
a beating heart, you know.

333
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,130
It can feel pain.

334
00:17:38,198 --> 00:17:39,790
And it has fingernails!

335
00:17:42,569 --> 00:17:45,163
Fingernails? Really?

336
00:18:01,121 --> 00:18:04,318
Welcome to Women Now,
where women are trusted friends.

337
00:18:04,391 --> 00:18:06,086
Please put your hands
where I can see them

338
00:18:06,159 --> 00:18:07,626
and surrender any bombs.

339
00:18:07,694 --> 00:18:10,959
Hey, I'm here for the big show.

340
00:18:11,031 --> 00:18:13,329
Your name, please?

341
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,459
Juno MacGuff.

342
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:17,469
<i>She thinks</i>
<i>I'm using a fake name,</i>

343
00:18:17,537 --> 00:18:20,199
<i>like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.</i>

344
00:18:22,075 --> 00:18:23,975
I need you to fill these out,
both sides,

345
00:18:24,044 --> 00:18:25,534
and don't skip the hairy details.

346
00:18:25,612 --> 00:18:27,773
We need to know about
every score and every sore.

347
00:18:29,883 --> 00:18:32,317
Would you like a free condom?

348
00:18:32,386 --> 00:18:33,853
They're boysenberry.

349
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:37,048
No, I'm... I'm off sex right now.

350
00:18:37,124 --> 00:18:39,524
My boyfriend uses them
every time we have intercourse.

351
00:18:39,593 --> 00:18:41,584
They make his junk

352
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,357
smell like pie.

353
00:19:17,097 --> 00:19:19,565
All babies want to get borned.

354
00:19:19,633 --> 00:19:21,726
All babies want to...

355
00:19:22,869 --> 00:19:25,599
God appreciates your miracle!

356
00:19:25,806 --> 00:19:28,036
Dude, what are you doing here?

357
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:29,939
I'm supposed to come
get you at 4:00.

358
00:19:30,010 --> 00:19:31,705
Couldn't do it, Leah.

359
00:19:31,778 --> 00:19:33,769
It smelled like
a dentist's office in there.

360
00:19:33,847 --> 00:19:35,474
And there were these
horrible magazines

361
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:36,709
with water stains.

362
00:19:36,783 --> 00:19:38,045
And then the friggin'
receptionist

363
00:19:38,118 --> 00:19:39,915
is trying to get me
to take these condoms

364
00:19:39,986 --> 00:19:41,681
that look like grape suckers.

365
00:19:41,755 --> 00:19:43,279
And just babbling away

366
00:19:43,357 --> 00:19:44,756
about her friggin'
boyfriend's pie balls.

367
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,554
Ooh, yum.

368
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:48,491
Oh, and then Su-Chin was there.
Yeah.

369
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,326
And she was like, "Oh, hi.
Babies have fingernails."

370
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:52,763
Fingernails.

371
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:54,300
That's gruesome. Do you
think the baby could all like

372
00:19:54,368 --> 00:19:55,835
scratch your vag
on the way out

373
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:57,335
and then it would...?

374
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,167
I'm staying pregnant, Leah.

375
00:19:59,239 --> 00:20:02,106
Dude! You got to keep
your voice down, okay?

376
00:20:02,175 --> 00:20:03,472
My mom is inside.

377
00:20:03,543 --> 00:20:05,010
She doesn't know that
we're sexually active.

378
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:06,340
What does that even mean?

379
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,846
I've been thinking.

380
00:20:07,914 --> 00:20:10,747
I was thinking I could, like,
have this baby

381
00:20:10,817 --> 00:20:12,978
and give it to someone that,
like, totally needs it.

382
00:20:13,053 --> 00:20:14,611
You know, like,
a woman with a bum ovary

383
00:20:14,688 --> 00:20:15,848
or a couple nice lesbos.

384
00:20:15,922 --> 00:20:18,220
But then you're gonna
get, like, huge.

385
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,588
And your chest is gonna milktate.

386
00:20:19,659 --> 00:20:21,786
And you're gonna have to,
like... tell people

387
00:20:21,862 --> 00:20:22,920
that you're pregnant.

388
00:20:22,996 --> 00:20:24,258
Yeah, but maybe they'll,
like, canonize me

389
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:25,559
for being so selfless.

390
00:20:25,632 --> 00:20:27,600
Or maybe they'll,
like, totally shit

391
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:30,067
and be really, really mad
and not let you graduate

392
00:20:30,137 --> 00:20:31,365
or go to Cabo for spring break.

393
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:33,838
I was gonna go to Gettysburg
with Bleeker anyway.

394
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,410
You should look at adoption ads.

395
00:20:38,478 --> 00:20:40,537
I see them all the time
in the <i>PennySaver.</i>

396
00:20:40,614 --> 00:20:43,174
They have ads for parents?

397
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,547
Yeah.

398
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:46,085
"Desperately seeking spawn"

399
00:20:46,153 --> 00:20:47,814
right next to, like, terriers

400
00:20:47,888 --> 00:20:49,788
and iguanas and used fitness
equipment and stuff.

401
00:20:49,856 --> 00:20:52,222
It's... it's, like, totally legit.

402
00:20:55,028 --> 00:20:58,486
Mm. "Wholesome, spiritually
wealthy couple

403
00:20:58,565 --> 00:21:01,090
have found true love
with each other." Aw.

404
00:21:01,168 --> 00:21:03,033
All that's missing is your bastard.

405
00:21:03,103 --> 00:21:04,502
I want a parakeet.

406
00:21:04,571 --> 00:21:06,505
Juno, you're totally
not even listening to me.

407
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:07,801
No, I heard you.

408
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:10,035
I just, like, I don't
want to give the baby

409
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:11,941
to a family that describes
themselves as "wholesome."

410
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:13,104
-Why?
-Well, I don't know,

411
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,511
I just want someone
a little more edgier.

412
00:21:14,581 --> 00:21:16,640
Okay, what did you
have in mind exactly?

413
00:21:16,716 --> 00:21:20,550
I was thinking more like...
graphic designer, mid-30s,

414
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,554
you know, with a cool Asian
girlfriend who, like,

415
00:21:22,622 --> 00:21:24,783
dresses awesome and rocks out
on the bass guitar.

416
00:21:24,858 --> 00:21:26,758
But I don't want to be
too particular.

417
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,692
Okay.

418
00:21:28,762 --> 00:21:29,854
Uh, how about this?

419
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,989
"Educated, successful
couple seeking

420
00:21:32,065 --> 00:21:34,363
"infant to join our family of five.

421
00:21:34,434 --> 00:21:36,231
"You will be compensated.

422
00:21:36,303 --> 00:21:39,101
Help us complete
the circle of love."

423
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,469
-Yeesh.
-That sounds great.

424
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,599
They sound like a freakin' cult
is what they sound like.

425
00:21:42,676 --> 00:21:43,904
And, besides, they
already have three kids.

426
00:21:43,977 --> 00:21:45,774
You know, they're just like
greedy little bitches.

427
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:46,870
Ooh, Juno.

428
00:21:46,947 --> 00:21:47,971
How about this one?

429
00:21:51,418 --> 00:21:54,114
<i>They were Mark</i>
<i>and Vanessa Loring,</i>

430
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:57,122
<i>and they were beautiful</i>
<i>even in black and white.</i>

431
00:22:07,267 --> 00:22:08,894
Hey, Paul, are you coming
downstairs to eat?

432
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:11,267
Uh, no, I don't think so.

433
00:22:11,338 --> 00:22:12,737
You ran eight miles today, puppy.

434
00:22:12,806 --> 00:22:15,536
I-I'm not hungry, oddly.

435
00:22:15,609 --> 00:22:16,974
But it's breakfast for supper.

436
00:22:17,043 --> 00:22:18,203
It's your favorite, Paul.

437
00:22:18,278 --> 00:22:20,439
Yeah.

438
00:22:20,514 --> 00:22:23,176
Juno MacGuff called while
you were out running today.

439
00:22:24,518 --> 00:22:26,213
You know how I feel about her.

440
00:22:26,286 --> 00:22:29,778
Yeah, yeah, you mentioned it
a couple times.

441
00:22:29,856 --> 00:22:32,188
She's just...

442
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:33,726
different.

443
00:22:33,793 --> 00:22:35,784
I know.

444
00:23:01,888 --> 00:23:04,948
So I'm not really sure
how I'm gonna spit this out.

445
00:23:05,025 --> 00:23:07,016
Hon, did you get expelled?

446
00:23:07,093 --> 00:23:08,958
No, the school would most
likely contact you

447
00:23:09,029 --> 00:23:11,156
in the event of my expulsion.

448
00:23:11,231 --> 00:23:12,357
Well, I was just asking.

449
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,558
It seemed plausible.

450
00:23:13,633 --> 00:23:15,100
What, do you need
a large amount of money?

451
00:23:15,168 --> 00:23:16,328
Legal counsel?

452
00:23:16,403 --> 00:23:19,270
I'm not...
I'm not asking for anything.

453
00:23:19,339 --> 00:23:20,966
Except for maybe mercy.

454
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:23,271
Like, it would be friggin' sweet
if no one hit me.

455
00:23:23,343 --> 00:23:24,571
Well, what have you done, June bug?

456
00:23:24,644 --> 00:23:25,941
Did you hit someone with the Previa?

457
00:23:26,012 --> 00:23:27,309
No.

458
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:30,372
Dude, I think it's
best to just tell them.

459
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,390
I'm pregnant.

460
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:39,516
Oh, God.

461
00:23:39,593 --> 00:23:41,060
Yeah, but
I'm gonna

462
00:23:41,127 --> 00:23:42,116
give it up for adoption.

463
00:23:42,195 --> 00:23:44,322
And I already found
the perfect couple.

464
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:46,456
They're gonna pay for the
medical expenses and everything.

465
00:23:46,533 --> 00:23:49,468
And-and...
what, 30, er, odd weeks,

466
00:23:49,536 --> 00:23:52,972
we can just pretend
that this never happened.

467
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:54,973
You're pregnant?

468
00:23:55,041 --> 00:23:57,202
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

469
00:23:57,277 --> 00:23:59,142
And if it is <i>any</i> consolation,

470
00:23:59,212 --> 00:24:02,272
I have heartburn that is
radiating my kneecaps,

471
00:24:02,349 --> 00:24:06,683
and I haven't taken
a dump since... Wednesday.

472
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:08,186
Morning.

473
00:24:08,254 --> 00:24:09,915
I didn't even know
you were sexually active.

474
00:24:11,224 --> 00:24:12,248
Who is the kid?

475
00:24:12,325 --> 00:24:14,623
The baby? I don't really
know much about it

476
00:24:14,694 --> 00:24:17,162
other than... I mean,
it has fingernails,

477
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:18,720
-allegedly.
-Nails? Really.

478
00:24:18,798 --> 00:24:19,560
Yeah.

479
00:24:19,633 --> 00:24:20,725
No, I don't, I mean,

480
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,392
who is the father, Juno?

481
00:24:22,469 --> 00:24:25,768
Um...

482
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,898
It's... it's Paulie Bleeker.

483
00:24:27,974 --> 00:24:29,601
Paulie Bleeker?

484
00:24:31,144 --> 00:24:32,543
What?

485
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:34,204
I didn't think he had it in him.

486
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,111
I know, right?

487
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,678
Right. This is no laughing matter.

488
00:24:38,752 --> 00:24:39,776
No, it's not.

489
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,378
And you know,
Paulie is actually great

490
00:24:42,455 --> 00:24:43,444
-in, uh...
-Okay.

491
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:44,581
In chair.

492
00:24:44,658 --> 00:24:47,593
You're thinking about adoption?

493
00:24:47,661 --> 00:24:50,459
Yeah, yeah, and it,
there's this couple

494
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:51,758
they haven't had, you know,

495
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:54,459
they've been trying to have
a kid for, like, five years.

496
00:24:54,534 --> 00:24:55,796
We found them
in the <i>PennySaver</i>

497
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:56,961
next to the exotic birds.

498
00:24:57,037 --> 00:24:58,026
And they have

499
00:24:58,104 --> 00:25:00,129
a legitimate lawyer

500
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:02,140
and I was gonna go
meet with them next weekend.

501
00:25:02,208 --> 00:25:03,368
June bug, that is

502
00:25:03,443 --> 00:25:05,035
a tough, tough thing to do.

503
00:25:05,111 --> 00:25:08,080
It's probably tougher than
you can understand right now.

504
00:25:08,148 --> 00:25:10,946
Oh, I... I know.

505
00:25:11,017 --> 00:25:14,885
And I... it's just that
I'm not ready to be a mom.

506
00:25:14,954 --> 00:25:16,546
Damn skippy, you're not.

507
00:25:16,623 --> 00:25:17,715
You don't even remember

508
00:25:17,791 --> 00:25:19,156
to give Liberty Bell
her breathing meds.

509
00:25:19,225 --> 00:25:22,661
That was once, and she
did not die, if you recall.

510
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:25,095
Honey, had
you considered

511
00:25:25,165 --> 00:25:27,793
you know... the alternative?

512
00:25:27,867 --> 00:25:29,095
No.

513
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:30,227
Well,

514
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,100
you're a little Viking.

515
00:25:33,573 --> 00:25:34,767
First things first.

516
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:36,433
All right, we have
to get you healthy.

517
00:25:36,509 --> 00:25:37,976
You need prenatal vitamins.

518
00:25:38,044 --> 00:25:40,444
Incidentally, they
do incredible things

519
00:25:40,513 --> 00:25:42,003
for your nails, so that's a plus.

520
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,346
Oh, and we need to schedule
a doctor's appointment.

521
00:25:44,417 --> 00:25:46,647
Figure out where
you're going to deliver.

522
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,450
Juno, I'm coming with you
to meet this... adoption couple.

523
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:50,784
You're just a kid.

524
00:25:50,857 --> 00:25:52,518
I don't want you
to get ripped off

525
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:53,957
by a couple
of baby-starved wing nuts.

526
00:25:54,027 --> 00:25:55,585
Thanks, Dad.

527
00:25:55,662 --> 00:25:57,653
Boy, I thought you were
the kind of girl

528
00:25:57,731 --> 00:25:59,198
who knew when to say when.

529
00:26:05,472 --> 00:26:08,202
I don't really know
what kind of girl I am.

530
00:26:19,152 --> 00:26:21,086
Whoa.

531
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:22,519
Just tell it to me straight, Bren.

532
00:26:22,589 --> 00:26:23,988
You think this is my fault?

533
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:27,049
I think kids get bored
and they have intercourse.

534
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:29,186
And I think June bug
was a dummy about it, Mac.

535
00:26:29,262 --> 00:26:31,594
I am not ready to be a Pop Pop.

536
00:26:31,664 --> 00:26:33,131
You're not gonna be a Pop Pop.

537
00:26:33,199 --> 00:26:36,726
Somebody else is gonna find
a precious blessing from Jesus

538
00:26:36,803 --> 00:26:38,862
in this garbage dump of a situation.

539
00:26:38,938 --> 00:26:42,066
Did you see that coming
when she sat us down here?

540
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:44,838
Yeah, but I was hoping she was
expelled or into hard drugs.

541
00:26:44,911 --> 00:26:47,402
That was my first instinct, too,
or a DWI.

542
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,347
Anything but this.

543
00:26:50,416 --> 00:26:52,350
And I'm gonna punch
that Bleeker kid in the wiener

544
00:26:52,418 --> 00:26:53,749
next time I see him.

545
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,185
Mac. Come on.

546
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:57,519
You know it wasn't his idea.

547
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:01,054
Yeah.

548
00:28:04,224 --> 00:28:05,350
Hi.

549
00:28:05,425 --> 00:28:07,017
I'm Vanessa.
You must be Juno.

550
00:28:07,093 --> 00:28:08,685
Mr. MacGuff, hi.

551
00:28:08,761 --> 00:28:10,160
Vanessa Loring.

552
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,027
It's, uh, Vanessa, right? Is that...

553
00:28:12,098 --> 00:28:14,362
Thanks for having me
and my irresponsible child

554
00:28:14,434 --> 00:28:15,560
over to your house.

555
00:28:15,635 --> 00:28:17,603
Oh, no, thank <i>you.</i>
Thank you.

556
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,695
Come on in.

557
00:28:19,772 --> 00:28:22,036
Can I take your coat or your hat?

558
00:28:22,108 --> 00:28:23,370
Oh, yeah, sure. Thanks.

559
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:26,503
Oh, wicked pic in the
<i>PennySaver,</i> by the way.

560
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,046
Super classy,
not like those people

561
00:28:28,114 --> 00:28:29,513
with the fake woods
in the background.

562
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:31,846
Honestly, who do they
think they're fooling?

563
00:28:31,918 --> 00:28:33,818
You found us in the <i>PennySaver?</i>

564
00:28:33,887 --> 00:28:35,980
Hi. Mark Loring.
I'm the husband.

565
00:28:36,055 --> 00:28:37,113
How you doing?

566
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,489
-Mac MacGuff.
-Nice to meet you. Hi.

567
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,858
This is Gerta Rauss,
our, um, attorney.

568
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:45,523
Gerta Rauss.

569
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:49,090
Hi. Nice to meet you.

570
00:28:49,168 --> 00:28:50,294
And this, of course, is Juno.

571
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:52,861
Like the city in Alaska.

572
00:28:52,939 --> 00:28:53,928
No.

573
00:28:54,007 --> 00:28:55,736
No?

574
00:28:55,808 --> 00:28:58,106
Hon? Shall we sit down,
get to know one another?

575
00:28:58,177 --> 00:28:59,610
Well, I thought I'd get some drinks.

576
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:00,737
What would anyone like?

577
00:29:00,813 --> 00:29:02,872
I have Pellegrino
or vitamin water or...

578
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:04,211
orange juice with...

579
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,344
I'll have
a Maker's Mark, please. Up.

580
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:09,820
She's kidding.

581
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:12,016
June bug has a wonderful
sense of humor,

582
00:29:12,091 --> 00:29:14,184
just one of her many genetic gifts.

583
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,591
I'll sit down.

584
00:29:17,463 --> 00:29:21,559
So, Juno, first off,
how far along are you?

585
00:29:21,634 --> 00:29:24,330
I'm a junior.

586
00:29:24,404 --> 00:29:26,065
No, I mean, in your pregnancy.

587
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:27,367
Oh, right.

588
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,237
Um, well, actually my stepmom

589
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:32,574
took me yesterday to the doctor,
and they said I was 12 weeks.

590
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,135
That's great. That's marvelous.

591
00:29:34,213 --> 00:29:36,181
So you're into your
second trimester.

592
00:29:36,249 --> 00:29:38,240
Uh... yeah.

593
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:41,316
Apparently. I'm due on May fourth.

594
00:29:41,387 --> 00:29:42,376
Great.

595
00:29:42,455 --> 00:29:43,581
My girlfriends tell me

596
00:29:43,656 --> 00:29:45,988
that the first couple of
months are the hardest.

597
00:29:46,059 --> 00:29:48,050
I didn't notice it at all, actually.

598
00:29:48,127 --> 00:29:50,595
Uh, I'm more concerned
about when they have to put

599
00:29:50,663 --> 00:29:52,927
that, like,
elastic band, you know,

600
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,364
in the front of my jeans.

601
00:29:54,434 --> 00:29:56,766
I think pregnancy's beautiful.

602
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,360
Oh, you're lucky it's not you.

603
00:30:02,141 --> 00:30:04,405
Let's talk about
how we're gonna do this thing.

604
00:30:04,477 --> 00:30:05,910
What do you mean,
don't I just

605
00:30:05,979 --> 00:30:10,279
have the thing, squeeze it
on out and hand it over?

606
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:13,649
Mark and Vanessa are willing
to negotiate an open adoption.

607
00:30:13,720 --> 00:30:14,778
Uh, wait,

608
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,378
what does that mean?

609
00:30:16,456 --> 00:30:18,424
It means they'd send
annual updates, photos,

610
00:30:18,491 --> 00:30:20,083
let Juno know how the baby is doing.

611
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,353
As he, or she, grows up.

612
00:30:21,427 --> 00:30:22,758
Whoa, whoa. No, no, no, no, no.

613
00:30:22,829 --> 00:30:26,287
I don't want photos or
any kind of notification.

614
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:28,095
You know. I mean...

615
00:30:28,167 --> 00:30:29,759
Can't we just, like,
kick this old school?

616
00:30:29,836 --> 00:30:31,963
You know, like, I-I stick
the baby in a basket

617
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:34,768
send it your way, like
Moses in the reeds?

618
00:30:34,841 --> 00:30:38,277
Technically, that would
be kicking it Old Testament.

619
00:30:38,344 --> 00:30:39,777
Exactly. Right?

620
00:30:39,846 --> 00:30:41,279
Do you know what I mean?

621
00:30:41,347 --> 00:30:43,838
Like in the good old days,
when it was quick and dirty.

622
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,511
Well, then... we all agree?

623
00:30:46,586 --> 00:30:49,578
A traditional closed adoption

624
00:30:49,655 --> 00:30:50,952
would be best for all involved.

625
00:30:51,024 --> 00:30:52,389
Shit. Yes.

626
00:30:52,458 --> 00:30:53,652
Just close 'er on up.

627
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:54,954
Obviously we

628
00:30:55,028 --> 00:30:57,155
would compensate you
for all your medical expenses.

629
00:30:57,230 --> 00:31:00,461
Are you looking for any other
type of compensation?

630
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:03,167
Excuse me?

631
00:31:06,072 --> 00:31:07,733
What? No.

632
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:10,275
No, I don't want to,
you know, sell the thing.

633
00:31:10,343 --> 00:31:14,609
I just... I want...

634
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,844
I just want the baby to be with
people who are gonna love it

635
00:31:18,918 --> 00:31:21,318
and be good parents, you know?

636
00:31:21,387 --> 00:31:22,411
Um...

637
00:31:22,488 --> 00:31:25,286
I mean, I-I'm in high school.

638
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:28,555
Dude, I'm-I'm just...
I'm ill-equipped.

639
00:31:29,829 --> 00:31:31,626
Well, you're doing a beautiful

640
00:31:31,697 --> 00:31:33,631
and a selfless thing for us.

641
00:31:33,699 --> 00:31:36,099
Vanessa's wanted a baby
ever since we got married.

642
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:38,137
I want to be a mommy so badly.

643
00:31:38,204 --> 00:31:40,195
You don't say.

644
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,867
Have you ever felt like you
were just born to do something?

645
00:31:42,942 --> 00:31:44,000
Yes.

646
00:31:44,077 --> 00:31:45,942
Heating and air-conditioning.

647
00:31:46,012 --> 00:31:48,446
There you go.

648
00:31:48,514 --> 00:31:50,106
I was born to be a mother.

649
00:31:50,183 --> 00:31:51,343
Some of us are.

650
00:31:51,417 --> 00:31:54,045
How about you, Mark?
Are you, uh...

651
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,350
looking forward to being a dad?

652
00:31:56,422 --> 00:31:57,787
Mmm. Betcha.

653
00:31:57,857 --> 00:31:59,119
Yeah.

654
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:00,659
Every guy wants to be a father,

655
00:32:00,726 --> 00:32:02,125
wants to coach the soccer team

656
00:32:02,195 --> 00:32:04,720
and help out
with the science fair...

657
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,731
the volcano goes off...
I don't know.

658
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:09,563
Yeah. All that.

659
00:32:09,635 --> 00:32:11,500
Maybe Gerta could take us through

660
00:32:11,571 --> 00:32:13,596
the preliminary documents
that you've drawn up.

661
00:32:13,673 --> 00:32:15,698
Sweet. Yeah, uh,

662
00:32:15,775 --> 00:32:17,606
could I use the facilities first?

663
00:32:17,677 --> 00:32:21,135
'Cause being pregnant
makes me pee like Seabiscuit.

664
00:32:21,214 --> 00:32:23,739
Sure. The downstairs
bathroom's being retiled,

665
00:32:23,816 --> 00:32:25,249
but if you go upstairs

666
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:26,615
and then to the right and to the...

667
00:32:26,686 --> 00:32:28,677
Oh, yeah.
The room with the toilet.

668
00:32:29,755 --> 00:32:31,017
Is she all right?

669
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:19,060
-Oh! It's you.
-Sorry.

670
00:33:19,138 --> 00:33:21,470
Sorry. I didn't expect
to see you up here.

671
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,735
Just came up to get something.

672
00:33:22,808 --> 00:33:26,266
Did your wife send you up here
to spy on me?

673
00:33:26,345 --> 00:33:29,746
No. What? Do we come off as
paranoid yuppies or something?

674
00:33:29,815 --> 00:33:34,582
Well, I... I stole a squirt
of your wife's perfume.

675
00:33:34,654 --> 00:33:37,487
-Really?
-It's Clinique Happy.

676
00:33:37,557 --> 00:33:40,219
Get a whiff
of those sparklin' top notes.

677
00:33:40,293 --> 00:33:43,387
Oh, yeah. That supposed
to make me feel... happy?

678
00:33:43,462 --> 00:33:45,191
You <i>should</i> feel happy, homes.

679
00:33:45,264 --> 00:33:47,129
I'm giving you and Vanessa
the gift of life?

680
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:49,191
sweet, screaming, pooping life?

681
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:50,633
and you don't
even have to be there

682
00:33:50,703 --> 00:33:52,295
-when it comes out all covered in, um...
-Viscera.

683
00:33:52,371 --> 00:33:54,271
Blood and guts.

684
00:33:56,175 --> 00:33:59,008
Uh... Whoa!

685
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:00,170
Is that a Les Paul?

686
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,510
Yes, it is.

687
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:04,914
Vanessa gave me my own room
for all my stuff.

688
00:34:04,984 --> 00:34:08,010
She gave you your own room
in... in... in...

689
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,248
in your whole house for your...
for your stuff?

690
00:34:10,323 --> 00:34:13,781
Wow. She's got you
on a long leash there, Mark.

691
00:34:13,859 --> 00:34:16,191
Oh, it's beautiful!

692
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:19,390
You know, I always loved Gibson
more than Fender. Like, just...

693
00:34:19,465 --> 00:34:21,262
What do you play?

694
00:34:21,334 --> 00:34:23,131
Um... I rock a Harmony.

695
00:34:23,202 --> 00:34:24,931
Oh.

696
00:34:25,004 --> 00:34:27,370
-Is it mahogany?
-Yeah.

697
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,271
And what happens
if you crack the neck?

698
00:34:29,342 --> 00:34:30,934
I mean, that must be,
like, a bitch to...

699
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,341
Tell me about it.
I used to play

700
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:34,641
in this real tight band when
I lived in Chicago, and this

701
00:34:34,714 --> 00:34:36,011
one night we opened up
for the Melvins,

702
00:34:36,082 --> 00:34:38,209
and I busted that thing
right onstage. It cost me $800

703
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,478
just to get it fixed.

704
00:34:39,552 --> 00:34:42,715
Whoa. So... so when was that?
Was that, like...?

705
00:34:42,788 --> 00:34:44,619
'93.
Best time for rock 'n' roll.

706
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,180
Nuh-uh!

707
00:34:46,259 --> 00:34:48,250
'77! Are you...?

708
00:34:48,327 --> 00:34:50,488
-What?!
<i>-Punk,</i> volume number one!

709
00:34:50,563 --> 00:34:51,552
You're crazy.

710
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:52,859
You weren't there.

711
00:34:52,932 --> 00:34:54,832
You couldn't understand the magic.

712
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,595
You weren't even alive!

713
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:00,402
What's that?

714
00:35:02,608 --> 00:35:04,098
It's a Pilates machine.

715
00:35:06,112 --> 00:35:08,239
What do you make with it?

716
00:35:08,314 --> 00:35:09,645
You don't make anything.

717
00:35:09,715 --> 00:35:11,307
It's for exercising.

718
00:35:11,384 --> 00:35:14,820
Yeah, my wife ordered
one of those, uh...

719
00:35:14,887 --> 00:35:17,583
Tony Little "Gazelles" off the TV.

720
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,818
You know, from the guy
with the ponytail?

721
00:35:19,892 --> 00:35:22,053
Guy just doesn't look right to me.

722
00:35:30,803 --> 00:35:33,033
I'll be right back.

723
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,369
Excuse me.

724
00:35:36,442 --> 00:35:38,376
... really want to

725
00:35:38,444 --> 00:35:42,107
Really, really want to,
and I do, too

726
00:35:43,916 --> 00:35:45,406
-I want to be...
-Hi.

727
00:35:45,484 --> 00:35:47,042
Hi.

728
00:35:47,119 --> 00:35:48,245
You're playing music.

729
00:35:48,321 --> 00:35:50,812
Juno wanted a little
closer look at Kimber.

730
00:35:50,890 --> 00:35:53,222
Your guitar is named Kimber?

731
00:35:53,292 --> 00:35:56,386
-Yeah.
-That's cool. My ax is named Roosevelt,

732
00:35:56,462 --> 00:35:57,929
but after Franklin, not Ted.

733
00:35:57,997 --> 00:36:00,830
Franklin?he was the hot one
with the polio?

734
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:03,266
Yeah. Um... hey, Gerta's downstairs.

735
00:36:03,336 --> 00:36:04,496
We still have...

736
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,061
we still have a lot of stuff
to go over and do.

737
00:36:07,139 --> 00:36:08,163
I got it. I got it.

738
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,502
-You got it?
-Got it.

739
00:36:09,575 --> 00:36:11,600
Not to interrupt
the jam session, but...

740
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:16,514
Just look these over.

741
00:36:16,582 --> 00:36:19,107
If you have any questions,
call me at my office.

742
00:36:19,185 --> 00:36:21,119
We would really appreciate
if you would just, you know,

743
00:36:21,187 --> 00:36:22,882
keep us updated
on any doctor's appointments

744
00:36:22,955 --> 00:36:25,423
or ultrasounds
or anything of that nature,

745
00:36:25,491 --> 00:36:27,857
-if it's not too much...
-No. Right. For sure.

746
00:36:27,927 --> 00:36:30,521
You want to know how
your kid's a-cookin'. I get it.

747
00:36:30,596 --> 00:36:33,064
You think you're really
going to do this, then?

748
00:36:33,132 --> 00:36:37,660
Yeah. Yeah. No. I...
I like you guys. Yeah.

749
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:41,173
How sure would you say you are?

750
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:45,574
Like... Would you say
you're 80% sure,

751
00:36:45,644 --> 00:36:48,135
or 90% sure or...?

752
00:36:48,214 --> 00:36:50,808
I'm going to say
I'm about 104% sure.

753
00:36:50,883 --> 00:36:52,111
Really?

754
00:36:52,184 --> 00:36:53,276
Here you go, sir.

755
00:36:53,352 --> 00:36:55,650
No, seriously, if I could
just have the thing,

756
00:36:55,721 --> 00:36:58,155
and give it to you now,
I totally would.

757
00:36:58,224 --> 00:37:00,055
But I'm guessing
it looks, probably,

758
00:37:00,126 --> 00:37:01,684
like a sea monkey
right now,

759
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:03,558
and, you know, we should
let it get a...

760
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:05,028
get a little...
get a little cuter.

761
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:06,223
-Right?
-Yes.
-That's great.

762
00:37:06,298 --> 00:37:07,322
Keep it in the oven.

763
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:08,958
I think that's a great idea.

764
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:10,058
Nice to meet you both.

765
00:37:10,136 --> 00:37:11,865
-You, too.
-Please drive carefully.

766
00:37:11,937 --> 00:37:14,337
-Hopefully, we'll hear from you soon.
-Thank you.

767
00:37:14,407 --> 00:37:16,307
Thank you.
-All right. You take care.

768
00:37:16,375 --> 00:37:17,842
All right. Bye-bye.

769
00:37:21,147 --> 00:37:22,205
Hmm?

770
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,215
Honey...

771
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:26,080
Come here.

772
00:37:33,893 --> 00:37:38,421
I'm sticking with you

773
00:37:38,497 --> 00:37:43,764
'Cause I'm made out of glue

774
00:37:43,836 --> 00:37:48,432
Anything that you might do

775
00:37:48,507 --> 00:37:51,772
I'm gonna do, too...

776
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:53,072
Hey, man.

777
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,772
Hey, Vijay.
How's it going?

778
00:37:54,847 --> 00:37:58,146
-Did you hear? Juno MacGuff's pregnant.
-Yeah.

779
00:37:58,217 --> 00:38:00,412
-Like our moms and teachers.
-Yeah.

780
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,885
Did you hear it's yours?

781
00:38:01,954 --> 00:38:04,422
Yep.

782
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,321
What a trip, huh?

783
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:09,122
I don't really know
too much about it.

784
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:10,856
You should grow a mustache.

785
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,557
I can't.

786
00:38:12,631 --> 00:38:13,723
Me neither.

787
00:38:13,799 --> 00:38:15,391
But I'm going
to stop wearing underpants.

788
00:38:15,468 --> 00:38:17,436
Raise my sperm count.

789
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:18,936
See ya.

790
00:38:19,004 --> 00:38:23,373
'Cause I'm made out of glue

791
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:27,902
Anything that you might do

792
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:32,110
I'm gonna do, too.

793
00:38:43,496 --> 00:38:46,192
-Juno, hey.
-Hey, Bleek.

794
00:38:46,265 --> 00:38:48,426
Me and some guys are going to
go to the movies after school,

795
00:38:48,501 --> 00:38:49,627
and we're going
to doughnut that flick

796
00:38:49,702 --> 00:38:50,794
with the guy who has 18 kids.

797
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:52,462
You want to come?

798
00:38:52,538 --> 00:38:56,975
Oh, it... sounds awesome,
but I got my ultrasound.

799
00:38:57,042 --> 00:38:59,909
Oh, really?

800
00:38:59,979 --> 00:39:02,106
Can I, uh...

801
00:39:02,181 --> 00:39:04,149
Should I come, you think?

802
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:07,617
Aw, you...
you can't waste those...

803
00:39:07,686 --> 00:39:09,551
those doughnut holes there.

804
00:39:09,622 --> 00:39:11,920
I... But maybe I could,
you know, drop by later.

805
00:39:11,991 --> 00:39:13,549
Okay. Cool.

806
00:39:13,626 --> 00:39:15,355
Later, Bleek.

807
00:39:15,427 --> 00:39:17,691
See ya.

808
00:39:17,763 --> 00:39:19,663
I'll save you a seat.

809
00:39:30,643 --> 00:39:32,508
There's your baby.

810
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,045
-Ah!
-Oh!

811
00:39:34,113 --> 00:39:35,580
Oh, my God!

812
00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:38,014
There's a hand.

813
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:39,175
-Oh!
-Oh!

814
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:40,980
And an arm.

815
00:39:44,356 --> 00:39:45,948
And there's the feet.

816
00:39:47,493 --> 00:39:48,790
Oh!

817
00:39:48,861 --> 00:39:50,192
Would you look at that?

818
00:39:51,397 --> 00:39:54,161
Whoa! Check out Baby Big Head!

819
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:55,996
Dude, that thing is freaky looking.

820
00:39:56,068 --> 00:39:58,298
Excuse me?
I am a sacred vessel,

821
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:00,804
all right? All you've got
in your stomach is Taco Bell.

822
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:04,341
It's amazing
that there's actually saps

823
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,672
that cry at this.

824
00:40:05,744 --> 00:40:08,645
What? I'm not made of stone.

825
00:40:08,714 --> 00:40:11,342
Well, there you have it.

826
00:40:11,417 --> 00:40:12,941
Would you like to know the sex?

827
00:40:13,018 --> 00:40:14,485
-Yes.
-No.

828
00:40:14,553 --> 00:40:16,851
-Please, Juno. Please!
-No. Definitely no. There's no sex.

829
00:40:16,922 --> 00:40:18,787
Planning to be surprised
when you deliver.

830
00:40:18,857 --> 00:40:21,223
Well, no, I want Mark
and Vanessa to be surprised,

831
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:22,385
and if you told me,

832
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,894
I'll just, like, ruin everything.

833
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,828
Are Mark and Vanessa
your friends at school?

834
00:40:25,898 --> 00:40:27,331
No, no, no.
They're the adoptive parents.

835
00:40:27,399 --> 00:40:30,232
Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.

836
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:32,736
What's that supposed to mean?

837
00:40:32,805 --> 00:40:36,332
I just see a lot of teenage
mothers come through here.

838
00:40:36,408 --> 00:40:37,773
It's obviously
a poisonous environment

839
00:40:37,843 --> 00:40:39,003
to raise a baby in.

840
00:40:39,078 --> 00:40:41,512
How do you know that
I'm so poisonous, you know?

841
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,912
Like, what if
these adoptive parents

842
00:40:43,983 --> 00:40:45,541
turn out to be, like,
evil molesters?

843
00:40:45,618 --> 00:40:47,313
Or, like, stage parents?

844
00:40:47,386 --> 00:40:48,751
They could be utterly negligent.

845
00:40:48,821 --> 00:40:50,982
Maybe they'll do a far
shittier job of raising a kid

846
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:52,080
than my dumbass stepdaughter
ever would.

847
00:40:52,157 --> 00:40:53,181
Have you considered that?

848
00:40:53,258 --> 00:40:55,749
No. I guess not.

849
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,092
Yeah.
What is your job title exactly?

850
00:40:58,163 --> 00:41:00,927
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

851
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:02,262
Well, I'm a nail technician,

852
00:41:02,334 --> 00:41:04,461
and I think we both ought
to stick to what we know.

853
00:41:05,638 --> 00:41:07,105
Excuse me?

854
00:41:07,172 --> 00:41:08,969
Oh, you think you're so special

855
00:41:09,041 --> 00:41:10,531
'cause you get
to play picture pages up there?

856
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:11,598
My five-year-old
daughter

857
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,008
could do that,
and let me tell you,

858
00:41:13,078 --> 00:41:14,909
she's not the brightest bulb
in the tanning bed.

859
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,709
So why don't you go back
to night school in Manteno

860
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:18,272
and learn a real trade?

861
00:41:23,322 --> 00:41:25,483
Bren, use a dick!

862
00:41:25,557 --> 00:41:28,890
I love it!

863
00:41:44,977 --> 00:41:52,008
Dearest, though you're
the nearest to my heart

864
00:41:52,084 --> 00:41:56,180
Please don't ever

865
00:41:56,255 --> 00:42:00,658
Ever say we'll part

866
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:04,389
You scold

867
00:42:04,463 --> 00:42:08,900
And you are so bold

868
00:42:08,967 --> 00:42:12,733
Yes, together, yeah

869
00:42:12,805 --> 00:42:16,571
I'm going to treat you right

870
00:42:16,642 --> 00:42:20,874
Yeah, I'm going
to treat you right.

871
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,187
Juno. Wow! I didn't
expect to see you here.

872
00:42:33,258 --> 00:42:35,351
I... I have something
really cool to show you guys.

873
00:42:35,427 --> 00:42:36,758
Is Vanessa here?

874
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:38,319
Uh... nope.

875
00:42:38,397 --> 00:42:40,126
Actually,
she's working late tonight.

876
00:42:40,199 --> 00:42:41,530
She's trying to accrue
as much time off

877
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,158
as she can before the...

878
00:42:43,235 --> 00:42:46,033
Oh, right. I hear these
are quite the time suck.

879
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,538
Yeah. You want to come on in?

880
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:48,800
I'm just having a ginseng cooler.

881
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:49,932
Would you like one?

882
00:42:50,008 --> 00:42:51,737
What is it with
you rich people

883
00:42:51,810 --> 00:42:53,107
and your herb-infused juices?

884
00:42:53,178 --> 00:42:55,009
It's probably
got something to do

885
00:42:55,080 --> 00:42:57,981
with those 44-packs they come in.

886
00:42:58,050 --> 00:42:59,745
They're not bad, though.

887
00:42:59,818 --> 00:43:02,082
Wait a second.
Why aren't you at work?

888
00:43:02,154 --> 00:43:04,281
I work mostly from home.
I'm a composer.

889
00:43:04,356 --> 00:43:07,223
No shit?

890
00:43:07,292 --> 00:43:09,157
Like Johann Brahms or...?

891
00:43:09,228 --> 00:43:11,128
No. More commercial stuff.

892
00:43:11,196 --> 00:43:12,322
Like what?

893
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:13,625
Commercials.

894
00:43:13,699 --> 00:43:15,360
-Oh.
-Yeah.

895
00:43:15,434 --> 00:43:17,527
Have you seen the ads for
the Titanium Power men's deodorant?

896
00:43:17,603 --> 00:43:21,403
Mmm! Uh-huh. Mmm-hmm.

897
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:24,965
Titanium Power-r-r-r

898
00:43:25,043 --> 00:43:28,570
Get more snatch
by the baa-atch.

899
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:29,909
Right. Paid for this kitchen.

900
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:32,712
Whoa!

901
00:43:32,785 --> 00:43:35,345
You're quite the sellout, Mark.

902
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,012
I mean, what would the Melvins say?

903
00:43:37,089 --> 00:43:40,547
Did you say you had
something to show me?

904
00:43:40,626 --> 00:43:44,426
Behold, good sir, your future child.

905
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,930
Hey, look at that.

906
00:43:49,301 --> 00:43:53,601
I think it looks
like my friend Paulie.

907
00:43:53,672 --> 00:43:55,503
Is he also bald and amorphous?

908
00:43:55,574 --> 00:43:57,041
No. He's the dad.

909
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:59,543
Oh. Wow.

910
00:43:59,611 --> 00:44:01,738
Can you tell
if it's a boy or a girl?

911
00:44:01,814 --> 00:44:03,304
Um... I can't.

912
00:44:03,382 --> 00:44:04,815
The doctor can.

913
00:44:04,883 --> 00:44:07,351
But I kind of want it
to be a surprise.

914
00:44:07,419 --> 00:44:09,410
Well, it can only
go one of two ways.

915
00:44:09,488 --> 00:44:10,648
That's what you think.

916
00:44:10,722 --> 00:44:12,189
I mean,
I drink tons of booze,

917
00:44:12,257 --> 00:44:14,987
so you might end up with one
of those scary neuter babies

918
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,085
that's born without junk.

919
00:44:17,162 --> 00:44:18,322
Junk, huh?

920
00:44:18,397 --> 00:44:20,422
Yeah.
You know, its parts.

921
00:44:20,499 --> 00:44:22,160
-I know what junk is.
-Yeah, right.

922
00:44:22,234 --> 00:44:24,293
We definitely want it
to have some junk. Please.

923
00:44:24,369 --> 00:44:26,132
You don't need
to worry about a thing.

924
00:44:26,205 --> 00:44:30,699
My stepmom, Bren, makes me
eat super healthy, you know?

925
00:44:30,776 --> 00:44:32,505
I can't stand
in front of the microwave,

926
00:44:32,578 --> 00:44:35,604
and no red M&Ms?
I hope you're ready.

927
00:44:35,681 --> 00:44:38,445
Ooh. Do you hear that?

928
00:44:38,517 --> 00:44:40,075
What?

929
00:44:40,152 --> 00:44:42,677
This is my favorite song.

930
00:44:42,754 --> 00:44:45,985
This is Sonic Youth doing
"Superstar" by the Carpenters.

931
00:44:46,058 --> 00:44:47,821
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know the Carpenters.

932
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:51,920
Chick drummer, freaky dude
not unlike the White Stripes.

933
00:44:51,997 --> 00:44:53,157
You haven't heard
the Carpenters like this.

934
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:55,257
Just listen.

935
00:44:56,368 --> 00:45:01,271
Your guitar

936
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:05,902
-It sounds so sweet and clear...
-Yeah. Yeah, I like this.

937
00:45:05,978 --> 00:45:07,946
What... what did you say
your favorite band was?

938
00:45:08,013 --> 00:45:10,413
Didn't.
It's a three-way tie between

939
00:45:10,482 --> 00:45:13,645
the Stooges, Patti Smith
and the Runaways.

940
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:15,584
I am definitely
making you some CDs,

941
00:45:15,654 --> 00:45:18,088
at least while my kid's in there.

942
00:45:18,156 --> 00:45:21,853
Don't you remember you told me
you love me, baby...

943
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:23,417
<i>The Wizard of Gore?</i>

944
00:45:23,495 --> 00:45:25,395
That is Herschell Gordon Lewis.

945
00:45:25,464 --> 00:45:27,261
He's the ultimate master of horror.

946
00:45:27,332 --> 00:45:31,632
Please! Dario Argento is so
the ultimate master of horror.

947
00:45:31,703 --> 00:45:35,036
Argento? He's... he's all right.

948
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:37,667
But Lewis is completely demented.

949
00:45:37,743 --> 00:45:39,938
Okay? We're talking
about buckets of goo.

950
00:45:40,012 --> 00:45:41,946
I mean, there's red corn syrup
all over the place.

951
00:45:42,014 --> 00:45:44,539
There's fake brains
coming out the yin-yang.

952
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:47,949
Quite frankly,
this looks a little stupid.

953
00:45:48,020 --> 00:45:51,820
Give me the tape.

954
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:05,698
Ugh...

955
00:46:05,771 --> 00:46:07,898
This is even better than <i>Suspiria.</i>

956
00:46:07,973 --> 00:46:09,031
What'd I tell you?

957
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:10,369
Kudos.

958
00:46:10,442 --> 00:46:13,036
You have decent taste
in slasher movies.

959
00:46:13,111 --> 00:46:15,545
Here's to dovetailing interests.

960
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,717
Have you guys thought
of any names for the baby yet?

961
00:46:20,786 --> 00:46:23,050
Uh, sort of, yes.

962
00:46:23,121 --> 00:46:25,715
Vanessa likes Madison for a girl.

963
00:46:27,592 --> 00:46:29,992
Madison?

964
00:46:30,062 --> 00:46:31,927
Wait, hold on.

965
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:36,400
Isn't that, like, a little... gay?

966
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,694
Wow, pretentious much?

967
00:46:39,771 --> 00:46:42,865
Should everyone just have
a mysterious name like Juno?

968
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:47,037
No... you see, my dad went
through this huge obsession

969
00:46:47,112 --> 00:46:49,012
with Roman and Greek mythology.

970
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:52,539
-So he decided to name me after Zeus' wife.
-I got it.

971
00:46:52,617 --> 00:46:54,278
Zeus, like, he had
tons of lays,

972
00:46:54,353 --> 00:46:56,947
but I'm pretty sure Juno
was his only wife.

973
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:01,356
And she was supposed to be, like,
really beautiful, but really mean.

974
00:47:01,426 --> 00:47:03,553
Like Diana Ross.

975
00:47:03,628 --> 00:47:05,960
That suits you.

976
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,329
Thanks?

977
00:47:10,235 --> 00:47:12,669
You are something else.

978
00:47:12,738 --> 00:47:14,672
Ah...

979
00:47:17,109 --> 00:47:20,272
There's Vanessa.
You'd better go.

980
00:47:20,345 --> 00:47:21,437
What? Why?

981
00:47:21,513 --> 00:47:23,640
She hates when I sit around
and I watch movies

982
00:47:23,715 --> 00:47:25,273
and I don't contribute.

983
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:27,011
No, I'll handle this.

984
00:47:27,085 --> 00:47:28,677
I'm really good at
defusing mom-type rage.

985
00:47:28,754 --> 00:47:29,846
No, no, Juno...

986
00:47:29,921 --> 00:47:31,684
-Hey, seriously...
-Hey, Mark, where are you?!

987
00:47:31,757 --> 00:47:33,657
-I got some stuff...
-Hey, Vanessa.

988
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:35,283
-Juno. What's going on?
-Oh, nothing.

989
00:47:35,360 --> 00:47:37,260
-What are you doing here? What's wrong?
-I went to the doctor today.

990
00:47:37,329 --> 00:47:38,887
Is something wrong with the baby?

991
00:47:38,964 --> 00:47:40,022
The baby's great.

992
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:41,258
It's the right size and everything.

993
00:47:41,333 --> 00:47:42,493
I even saw its phalanges today.

994
00:47:42,567 --> 00:47:45,502
Here.

995
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,696
It's a baby.

996
00:47:46,772 --> 00:47:48,637
-Oh...
-It's your baby.

997
00:47:50,609 --> 00:47:55,137
Kind of looks like
it's waving, you know.

998
00:47:55,213 --> 00:47:56,475
Like it's saying...

999
00:47:56,548 --> 00:47:59,278
"Hey, Vanessa, will you be my mom?"

1000
00:47:59,351 --> 00:48:00,818
Oh, it kind of does.

1001
00:48:00,886 --> 00:48:02,251
Right?

1002
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:04,618
Juno was nice enough to bring
that over for us today.

1003
00:48:04,689 --> 00:48:05,815
Yeah, I came as soon

1004
00:48:05,891 --> 00:48:08,223
as I got that ultrasound
goo off my pelvis.

1005
00:48:08,293 --> 00:48:10,386
It was crazy actually.

1006
00:48:10,462 --> 00:48:13,431
My stepmom verbally abused
the ultrasound tech

1007
00:48:13,498 --> 00:48:16,058
and we got escorted
off the premises.

1008
00:48:19,438 --> 00:48:22,066
Wow, what kind of
swag did you score?

1009
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:24,040
Mall madness, huh?

1010
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:26,202
It's just some stuff I picked up
for the baby.

1011
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:29,270
Don't you usually get all that
stuff at like a baby shower?

1012
00:48:29,347 --> 00:48:31,781
'Cause my stepmom?she was
pregnant with my little sister

1013
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:34,080
and she got a million gifts,
you know?

1014
00:48:34,152 --> 00:48:35,141
But I wasn't jealous,

1015
00:48:35,220 --> 00:48:36,448
'cause they all super lame.

1016
00:48:36,521 --> 00:48:38,318
I doubt anyone's going
to throw us a shower.

1017
00:48:38,390 --> 00:48:40,119
Why wouldn't they throw you
a baby shower?

1018
00:48:40,192 --> 00:48:41,216
I don't think people know...

1019
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:43,887
how to feel about
the situation

1020
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:47,125
because it's...
not set in stone.

1021
00:48:47,199 --> 00:48:48,530
What isn't set?

1022
00:48:50,235 --> 00:48:51,634
No, no, no, no, no.

1023
00:48:51,703 --> 00:48:53,898
You don't think that I'm going
to flake out on you?

1024
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,371
No, I don't, Juno.

1025
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,431
We went through
a situation before

1026
00:48:57,509 --> 00:48:58,908
where it didn't work out.

1027
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,740
Yeah, cold feet.

1028
00:49:00,812 --> 00:49:02,439
Oh.

1029
00:49:05,917 --> 00:49:07,817
You should have gone to China.

1030
00:49:07,886 --> 00:49:10,650
You know, 'cause I hear
they give away babies

1031
00:49:10,722 --> 00:49:11,746
like free iPods.

1032
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:13,222
You know,

1033
00:49:13,291 --> 00:49:15,350
they pretty much just put them
in those T-shirt guns

1034
00:49:15,427 --> 00:49:16,951
and shoot them out
at sporting events.

1035
00:49:19,297 --> 00:49:22,232
Your parents are probably
wondering where you are.

1036
00:49:22,300 --> 00:49:24,928
Nah.
I mean, I'm already pregnant,

1037
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:27,096
so what other kind of shenanigans
could I get into?

1038
00:49:27,172 --> 00:49:30,073
Though, I should...
I should probably bounce.

1039
00:49:30,142 --> 00:49:31,234
Hey, don't forget your bag.

1040
00:49:31,309 --> 00:49:32,708
Oh, bag.

1041
00:49:32,777 --> 00:49:36,679
Thank you.

1042
00:49:36,748 --> 00:49:39,512
Okay, take care.

1043
00:50:01,173 --> 00:50:03,300
Where the hell
have you been, June bug?

1044
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:06,833
I just drove to St. Cloud to show
Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.

1045
00:50:06,912 --> 00:50:08,971
I ended up staying
for a couple hours.

1046
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,275
A couple hours?!

1047
00:50:10,348 --> 00:50:12,145
What are you going over there
in the first place?

1048
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:15,653
Oh, they just... you know,
they wanted to know about the stuff

1049
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,950
and I said I'd keep
them updated, so I did.

1050
00:50:18,023 --> 00:50:19,684
Well, you could have
mailed it to them.

1051
00:50:19,758 --> 00:50:22,591
Why would you drive an hour
out to East Jesus Nowhere?

1052
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:25,152
Mm-mm!
I just did.

1053
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:27,698
You know, and while Mark and I
were waiting for Vanessa,

1054
00:50:27,766 --> 00:50:29,996
we, uh, we watched
<i>The Wizard of Gore</i>

1055
00:50:30,068 --> 00:50:32,332
and then he burnt me

1056
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:34,235
a couple CDs of this weird music.

1057
00:50:34,306 --> 00:50:36,501
So, it was cool.
He's kind of cool.

1058
00:50:38,243 --> 00:50:42,646
Juno, you can't just
drop in on them like that.

1059
00:50:42,714 --> 00:50:45,012
No, it... it was not a big deal.

1060
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,744
He was totally cool with it.

1061
00:50:46,818 --> 00:50:48,115
You don't understand.

1062
00:50:48,186 --> 00:50:49,585
Mark is a married man.

1063
00:50:49,654 --> 00:50:50,814
There are boundaries.

1064
00:50:50,889 --> 00:50:52,880
Oh, come on.

1065
00:50:52,958 --> 00:50:55,552
Listen, Brenda...

1066
00:50:55,627 --> 00:50:57,993
Now you're acting
like you're the one

1067
00:50:58,063 --> 00:50:59,758
who has to go through this.

1068
00:50:59,831 --> 00:51:01,822
Like you're the one
who has to get huge

1069
00:51:01,900 --> 00:51:04,266
and shove a baby out
of your vag for someone else.

1070
00:51:04,336 --> 00:51:06,236
And what does it even matter
if he's married?

1071
00:51:06,304 --> 00:51:07,862
I can have friends that are married.

1072
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:09,270
It doesn't work that way, kiddo.

1073
00:51:09,341 --> 00:51:11,138
You don't know squat about
the dynamics of marriage.

1074
00:51:11,209 --> 00:51:12,972
You don't know anything about me.

1075
00:51:13,044 --> 00:51:14,705
I know enough.

1076
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:18,143
We don't even have a dog.

1077
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:19,683
Yeah, we don't have a dog

1078
00:51:19,751 --> 00:51:21,150
because you're allergic
to their saliva.

1079
00:51:21,219 --> 00:51:23,210
I have sacrificed a lot

1080
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:25,756
for you, Juno, and in a
couple years, when you move out,

1081
00:51:25,824 --> 00:51:27,689
I'm going to get Weimaraners.

1082
00:51:27,759 --> 00:51:29,624
Oh, dream big.

1083
00:51:29,694 --> 00:51:32,663
Oh, go fly a kite!

1084
00:51:54,452 --> 00:51:56,682
Hey, Juno.

1085
00:51:56,755 --> 00:51:58,689
What can I do for you?

1086
00:51:58,757 --> 00:52:01,021
Uh, Bleeker home?

1087
00:52:01,092 --> 00:52:04,027
<i>Bleeker's mom was possibly</i>
<i>attractive once,</i>

1088
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:08,191
<i>but now she looks like a hobbit.</i>

1089
00:52:08,266 --> 00:52:10,564
<i>You know the fat one</i>
<i>that was in</i> The Goonies?

1090
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,475
Hey, man.

1091
00:52:18,543 --> 00:52:19,737
Don't concentrate so hard.

1092
00:52:19,811 --> 00:52:22,302
I think I can smell
your hair a-burnin'.

1093
00:52:22,380 --> 00:52:23,506
Hey, what's up?

1094
00:52:23,581 --> 00:52:26,482
Not much. I just...
wanted to come say hey.

1095
00:52:26,551 --> 00:52:28,781
I mean, I miss like... just
hanging out with you

1096
00:52:28,853 --> 00:52:30,286
on school nights, you know.

1097
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:35,019
<i>Orange tic tacs are Bleeker's</i>
<i>one and only vice.</i>

1098
00:52:35,093 --> 00:52:36,685
<i>The day I got pregnant,</i>

1099
00:52:36,761 --> 00:52:39,662
<i>his mouth tasted really tangy</i>
<i>and delicious.</i>

1100
00:52:46,705 --> 00:52:49,333
Boy, you really...

1101
00:52:49,407 --> 00:52:52,501
really seem to be getting,
uh, pregnant-er these days.

1102
00:52:52,577 --> 00:52:53,737
Yeah.

1103
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:58,313
You know, I set up this
whole private adoption,

1104
00:52:58,383 --> 00:53:00,374
and this... this
married couple

1105
00:53:00,452 --> 00:53:02,818
in like St. Cloud, they're...
they're going to be the parents.

1106
00:53:02,887 --> 00:53:03,945
-So, it's...
-Really?

1107
00:53:04,022 --> 00:53:05,284
Yeah.

1108
00:53:05,357 --> 00:53:06,619
Wow, what are they like?

1109
00:53:06,691 --> 00:53:10,218
Well, I mean, the guy?he's awesome.

1110
00:53:10,295 --> 00:53:12,456
His name is Mark and, um...

1111
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,122
he likes old
horror movies

1112
00:53:14,199 --> 00:53:15,757
and he plays the guitar.

1113
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:17,802
We actually hung out this afternoon.

1114
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:19,598
Is that normal?

1115
00:53:19,671 --> 00:53:21,400
Probably not, but...

1116
00:53:21,473 --> 00:53:23,498
Listen, I talked

1117
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:27,568
to Dad and Bren and they said they
wouldn't narc you out to your folks, so...

1118
00:53:27,645 --> 00:53:29,169
Okay.

1119
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:30,874
I think we should be cool, you know?

1120
00:53:30,949 --> 00:53:32,678
That's a relief.

1121
00:53:36,354 --> 00:53:42,020
I'm gonna start looking like
a pretty big dork soon.

1122
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:46,291
You still going to think
I'm cute when I'm huge?

1123
00:53:46,364 --> 00:53:49,458
I always think you're cute.

1124
00:53:49,534 --> 00:53:50,762
I think you're beautiful.

1125
00:53:50,835 --> 00:53:53,167
Geez, Bleek.

1126
00:53:53,238 --> 00:53:55,297
I do.

1127
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,635
Hey, June bug, you know,
when this is all over

1128
00:54:00,712 --> 00:54:02,270
we should get the band
back together.

1129
00:54:02,347 --> 00:54:05,783
Yeah. I mean, that would be...
that would be awesome.

1130
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:08,478
I mean, once Tino gets
the new drumhead,

1131
00:54:08,553 --> 00:54:10,453
we're just, like, ready to rock.

1132
00:54:10,522 --> 00:54:12,149
And, I mean, we could...

1133
00:54:12,223 --> 00:54:14,384
we could always
get back together, too.

1134
00:54:14,459 --> 00:54:15,585
It's an option.

1135
00:54:18,029 --> 00:54:21,795
Oh... were we together?

1136
00:54:21,866 --> 00:54:27,202
Yeah, we were once, you know...
that... that time.

1137
00:54:33,978 --> 00:54:35,912
What about Katrina De Voort?

1138
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,777
You could totally go out
with Katrina De Voort.

1139
00:54:37,849 --> 00:54:38,907
I don't like Katrina.

1140
00:54:38,983 --> 00:54:40,507
She smells like soup.

1141
00:54:40,585 --> 00:54:42,348
I mean, have you ever smelled her?

1142
00:54:42,420 --> 00:54:44,388
And her whole house
smells like soup.

1143
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:54,027
Okay...

1144
00:54:54,098 --> 00:54:58,330
So we have custard and cheesecake.

1145
00:54:58,403 --> 00:55:01,566
They're yellow.

1146
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:04,972
Right. I wanted to pick something
that was gender-neutral

1147
00:55:05,043 --> 00:55:07,568
until we get the baby
and then we can just add

1148
00:55:07,645 --> 00:55:09,112
a more decisive palette.

1149
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:11,375
Why does everybody think
yellow is gender-neutral?

1150
00:55:11,449 --> 00:55:15,078
-I don't know any guy with a yellow bedroom.
-It's for babies.

1151
00:55:15,153 --> 00:55:18,020
I'm thinking more custard.

1152
00:55:18,089 --> 00:55:19,488
Just with this light.

1153
00:55:19,557 --> 00:55:22,082
I don't know, maybe I should
I should paint a larger swatch

1154
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,560
or just try it on
a different wall...

1155
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:29,591
Or you can wait a few more months.

1156
00:55:29,667 --> 00:55:31,692
Like the baby's going
to come storming in here

1157
00:55:31,769 --> 00:55:33,600
demanding dessert-colored walls.

1158
00:55:37,275 --> 00:55:41,609
<i>What to Expect</i> says
that readying the baby's room

1159
00:55:41,679 --> 00:55:44,409
is an important
process for the woman.

1160
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:46,143
Especially if you're adopting.

1161
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:47,741
It's called "nesting."

1162
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:49,286
Nesting?

1163
00:55:49,354 --> 00:55:51,083
Yeah.

1164
00:55:51,155 --> 00:55:54,716
Are you going to build
a crib out of sticks and spit?

1165
00:55:54,792 --> 00:55:56,419
Hmm?

1166
00:55:56,494 --> 00:55:58,189
Well, you should read the book.

1167
00:55:58,263 --> 00:56:00,595
I flagged the daddy
chapters. They're...

1168
00:56:00,665 --> 00:56:02,223
I think it's too early to paint.

1169
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:03,892
That's my opinion.

1170
00:56:03,968 --> 00:56:06,436
I disagree.

1171
00:56:10,475 --> 00:56:12,409
This wall is going
to need something.

1172
00:56:15,647 --> 00:56:17,478
Our first family photo
right in the middle.

1173
00:56:17,549 --> 00:56:19,608
Right up there.

1174
00:56:21,619 --> 00:56:24,281
Can you see it?

1175
00:56:27,992 --> 00:56:30,961
Yum! This pretzel tastes
like a friggin' donut.

1176
00:56:31,029 --> 00:56:32,053
Well, share the love, sweetie.

1177
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:34,155
No, you can't have any.

1178
00:56:34,232 --> 00:56:36,598
She's assaulting me.

1179
00:56:36,668 --> 00:56:39,398
She's denying me
fresh-baked goodness.

1180
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:41,335
-Oh, my God.
-What?

1181
00:56:41,406 --> 00:56:42,805
That's her.

1182
00:56:42,874 --> 00:56:44,808
That's Vanessa Loring.

1183
00:56:44,876 --> 00:56:46,366
Of the <i>PennySaver</i> Lorings?

1184
00:56:48,513 --> 00:56:52,415
Dude, she's, like, really pretty.

1185
00:56:52,483 --> 00:56:54,280
You sound, like,
totally shocked or something.

1186
00:56:54,352 --> 00:56:58,846
She's totally going to, like, steal
that little kid for her collection.

1187
00:56:58,923 --> 00:57:00,857
Right? Seriously.

1188
00:57:09,434 --> 00:57:10,901
Boring.

1189
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:12,596
Ah...

1190
00:57:20,011 --> 00:57:23,139
Oh, I could so go for, like,
a huge cookie right now

1191
00:57:23,214 --> 00:57:25,910
with, like, a lamb
kebab simultaneously.

1192
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:29,078
God, spermie, must you always feed?

1193
00:57:29,153 --> 00:57:32,987
It's like never ending,
pretty much, you know.

1194
00:57:33,057 --> 00:57:34,319
Juno!

1195
00:57:34,392 --> 00:57:35,654
-Hi.
-Hi, Juno.

1196
00:57:35,727 --> 00:57:38,389
Vanessa, what, what
brings you to the mall today?

1197
00:57:38,463 --> 00:57:41,489
I was just shopping, you know,
with my girlfriends, and...

1198
00:57:41,566 --> 00:57:42,897
You're gay?

1199
00:57:42,967 --> 00:57:44,229
-No.
-Oh, please, just ignore her.

1200
00:57:44,302 --> 00:57:45,633
Okay.

1201
00:57:45,703 --> 00:57:47,170
Well, how are you feeling?

1202
00:57:47,238 --> 00:57:49,866
Great. Everything's
stupendous, you know.

1203
00:57:49,941 --> 00:57:52,705
Oh, coming in on that snooze button.

1204
00:57:52,777 --> 00:57:56,110
Wow. It's incredible.

1205
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:58,011
Huh. Oh, God.

1206
00:57:58,082 --> 00:57:59,913
What?

1207
00:57:59,984 --> 00:58:02,475
Kicking... kicking away.

1208
00:58:04,656 --> 00:58:07,250
Could... could I feel it?

1209
00:58:07,325 --> 00:58:08,883
Are you kidding?

1210
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,518
Oh.

1211
00:58:10,595 --> 00:58:11,994
God, that's cool.

1212
00:58:12,063 --> 00:58:14,258
Everyone's just, like,
grabbing my belly all the time.

1213
00:58:14,332 --> 00:58:16,197
It's crazy, but I'm
a legend, you know.

1214
00:58:16,267 --> 00:58:17,791
They call me the cautionary whale.

1215
00:58:21,806 --> 00:58:23,637
I can't feel anything.

1216
00:58:25,943 --> 00:58:28,878
It's not moving for me.

1217
00:58:28,946 --> 00:58:31,073
Well, you should try
talking to it,

1218
00:58:31,149 --> 00:58:32,912
'cause, like, supposedly
they can hear you

1219
00:58:32,984 --> 00:58:35,782
even though it's all, like,
10,000 leagues under the sea.

1220
00:58:50,234 --> 00:58:52,225
Hi, baby.

1221
00:58:53,938 --> 00:58:55,872
Um...

1222
00:58:55,940 --> 00:58:57,498
It's me.

1223
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,566
It's... Vanessa.

1224
00:59:04,048 --> 00:59:06,039
I can't wait to meet you.

1225
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:16,390
Can you hear me, baby?

1226
00:59:16,461 --> 00:59:18,452
Sweet ángel?

1227
00:59:28,740 --> 00:59:30,002
I felt him!

1228
00:59:30,074 --> 00:59:31,974
Oh, God.

1229
00:59:32,043 --> 00:59:34,671
That was magical.

1230
00:59:38,683 --> 00:59:42,278
Thank you. Thank you.

1231
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,198
Elope with me, Miss Private

1232
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:59,464
And we'll sail
around the world

1233
00:59:59,537 --> 01:00:03,200
I will be your Ferdinand
and you my wayward girl

1234
01:00:03,274 --> 01:00:07,404
How many nights of talking
in hotel rooms can you take?

1235
01:00:07,478 --> 01:00:12,142
How many nights of limping
'round some pagan holidays?

1236
01:00:12,216 --> 01:00:14,081
Oh, elope with me in private

1237
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,677
And we'll set
something ablaze

1238
01:00:16,754 --> 01:00:20,485
A trail for the devil
to erase...

1239
01:00:20,558 --> 01:00:23,425
And... if you can't,
if you can't decide

1240
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:25,655
Between a little breakfast
and lunch

1241
01:00:25,730 --> 01:00:27,721
Why don't you microwave
yourself

1242
01:00:27,799 --> 01:00:30,859
A little bowl of brunch?

1243
01:00:34,205 --> 01:00:35,194
Hello?

1244
01:00:35,273 --> 01:00:36,262
Hey!

1245
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:37,329
Hi.

1246
01:00:37,408 --> 01:00:38,397
So, um,

1247
01:00:38,476 --> 01:00:39,465
I've been listening to that

1248
01:00:39,544 --> 01:00:40,841
really weird CD that you made me.

1249
01:00:40,912 --> 01:00:42,209
Yeah, what's the verdict?

1250
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,941
Well, it's cute.

1251
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,778
"It's cute"?

1252
01:00:45,850 --> 01:00:46,839
When you're used to listening

1253
01:00:46,918 --> 01:00:48,749
to the raw power
of Iggy and The Stooges,

1254
01:00:48,820 --> 01:00:50,788
everything else just sounds
kind of like...

1255
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:52,254
precious in comparison.

1256
01:00:52,323 --> 01:00:54,723
Well, I imagine you've got
a collection of punk chestnuts

1257
01:00:54,792 --> 01:00:55,850
to prove your point.

1258
01:00:55,927 --> 01:00:59,727
Well... consider it
your musical education.

1259
01:00:59,797 --> 01:01:02,129
Can't wait to see what
you've got to teach me.

1260
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:04,760
Stop surfing porn
and get back to work.

1261
01:01:06,037 --> 01:01:07,937
I just wanted to call and say hi.

1262
01:01:08,005 --> 01:01:10,303
Right.
Go learn something.

1263
01:01:11,776 --> 01:01:13,937
I'll have a little trip
down Mexico way.

1264
01:01:14,011 --> 01:01:16,479
And Greece and China apparently.

1265
01:01:16,547 --> 01:01:18,105
How many months has it been now?

1266
01:01:18,182 --> 01:01:19,240
You're getting huge.

1267
01:01:19,317 --> 01:01:21,615
Oh, it's honing in on eight.

1268
01:01:21,686 --> 01:01:23,517
You should see
how weird I look naked.

1269
01:01:23,588 --> 01:01:25,522
I wish my fun bags would get bigger.

1270
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:27,182
God, trust me, you don't.

1271
01:01:27,258 --> 01:01:29,692
I have to actually wear
a frickin' bra now

1272
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:32,490
and rub all this nasty
cocoa butter stuff on myself

1273
01:01:32,563 --> 01:01:34,827
so, like... I don't know,
my skin won't explode.

1274
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,059
Hot.

1275
01:01:39,136 --> 01:01:41,229
Why is everyone
always staring at me?

1276
01:01:41,305 --> 01:01:44,103
Well, you are kind of
convex, you know.

1277
01:01:44,175 --> 01:01:45,608
Whoa-uh!

1278
01:01:45,676 --> 01:01:47,769
Who's been doing their
geometry homework for once?

1279
01:01:47,845 --> 01:01:49,142
I have no choice.

1280
01:01:49,213 --> 01:01:51,943
Keith's been grading me, like,
so hard lately.

1281
01:01:52,016 --> 01:01:54,484
Do not call Mr. Connors Keith.

1282
01:01:54,552 --> 01:01:55,951
Why?

1283
01:01:56,020 --> 01:01:58,011
'Cause my barf reflex
is really heightened these days.

1284
01:01:58,089 --> 01:01:59,147
But Keith's hot.

1285
01:01:59,223 --> 01:02:03,990
Ew, he's all beardy.

1286
01:02:04,061 --> 01:02:07,997
Did you hear that Bleek is going
to prom with Katrina De Voort?

1287
01:02:08,065 --> 01:02:10,863
Katrina?!

1288
01:02:10,935 --> 01:02:12,869
No, way, no,
he doesn't like Katrina.

1289
01:02:12,937 --> 01:02:14,529
Must be, like, a pity date
or something.

1290
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,594
I heard he asked her.

1291
01:02:15,673 --> 01:02:17,402
And that they're
going to Benihana

1292
01:02:17,475 --> 01:02:20,342
and then prom and
then Vijay's parents' cabin.

1293
01:02:20,411 --> 01:02:21,571
Oh, what're you talk...

1294
01:02:21,646 --> 01:02:23,614
He told me that Katrina's
house smells like soup.

1295
01:02:23,681 --> 01:02:25,205
Oh. Oh, my God, it totally does.

1296
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:27,547
I was there, like, four years
ago for a birthday party.

1297
01:02:27,618 --> 01:02:29,643
Oh, my God,
it's like Lipton Landing.

1298
01:02:29,720 --> 01:02:33,451
But, you know, boys have endured
way worse things for nookie.

1299
01:02:33,524 --> 01:02:35,014
Oh, please.

1300
01:02:35,092 --> 01:02:37,287
There is no way
that they're having sex.

1301
01:02:37,361 --> 01:02:39,488
I mean, they wouldn't even
be holding hands.

1302
01:02:39,563 --> 01:02:41,326
Oh, I wouldn't be so sure.
He did it with you.

1303
01:02:41,399 --> 01:02:43,333
Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me,
you know.

1304
01:02:43,401 --> 01:02:44,834
We're best friends.

1305
01:02:44,902 --> 01:02:46,699
Are you jealous?

1306
01:02:46,771 --> 01:02:48,830
I thought you said
you didn't care what he did.

1307
01:02:48,906 --> 01:02:50,840
Not jealous, don't care.

1308
01:02:50,908 --> 01:02:53,274
It's just, I know Bleek
doesn't like Katrina, you know.

1309
01:02:53,344 --> 01:02:54,936
He shouldn't toy
with her emotions like that,

1310
01:02:55,012 --> 01:02:56,377
'cause she seems pretty nice.

1311
01:02:56,447 --> 01:02:58,711
Uh-huh,
I'm really convinced.

1312
01:02:58,783 --> 01:03:00,410
You know, prom is
for weenuses anyway.

1313
01:03:00,484 --> 01:03:04,181
As soon as you you're old enough
to go, it's so not cool anymore.

1314
01:03:12,797 --> 01:03:16,324
Are you honestly and truly going
to prom with Katrina De Voort?

1315
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,595
Uh, hi.

1316
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:20,330
Leah just-just said that
you were going to go with her.

1317
01:03:20,404 --> 01:03:22,429
Yeah, I did ask her
if she wanted to go.

1318
01:03:22,506 --> 01:03:24,133
Um, a bunch of us
from the team

1319
01:03:24,208 --> 01:03:26,608
are going to go to Benihana
and then go to the prom

1320
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,702
and then go
to Vijay's parents' cabin,

1321
01:03:28,779 --> 01:03:30,713
so...

1322
01:03:30,781 --> 01:03:34,182
We-we-we're getting a stretch limo.

1323
01:03:34,251 --> 01:03:37,550
Your mom must be pretty stoked
that you're not taking me.

1324
01:03:37,621 --> 01:03:40,488
You're mad. Why are you mad?

1325
01:03:40,558 --> 01:03:42,321
I'm not mad. I'm in a...

1326
01:03:42,393 --> 01:03:44,122
I'm in a great mood.

1327
01:03:44,195 --> 01:03:45,924
I mean, despite the fact
that well, I'm in a fat suit

1328
01:03:45,997 --> 01:03:47,430
that I can't take off
and despite the fact

1329
01:03:47,498 --> 01:03:50,228
that pretty much everyone's
making fun of me behind my back

1330
01:03:50,301 --> 01:03:52,701
and despite the fact
that your little girlfriend

1331
01:03:52,770 --> 01:03:55,238
gave me the stink eye
in art class yesterday...

1332
01:03:55,306 --> 01:03:56,364
Katrina's not my girlfriend,
all right?

1333
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,032
And I doubt that
she gave you the stink eye.

1334
01:03:58,109 --> 01:04:00,043
That's just... the way
her face looks, you know.

1335
01:04:00,111 --> 01:04:01,635
That's just her face.

1336
01:04:03,347 --> 01:04:06,783
Yeah, what... You-you just take
Soupy Sales to prom.

1337
01:04:06,851 --> 01:04:09,285
I can think of so many
cooler things to do that night.

1338
01:04:09,353 --> 01:04:11,719
Like, you know what, Bleek?
I might pumice my feet.

1339
01:04:11,789 --> 01:04:13,882
I might go to
Bren's dumb Unitarian Church.

1340
01:04:13,958 --> 01:04:16,722
Maybe get hit by a truck full of
hot garbage juice, you know,

1341
01:04:16,794 --> 01:04:19,228
'cause all those things
would be exponentially cooler

1342
01:04:19,296 --> 01:04:21,127
than going to prom with you.

1343
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:26,065
You're being really immature.

1344
01:04:26,137 --> 01:04:28,469
You have no reason to be mad at me.

1345
01:04:28,539 --> 01:04:30,803
I mean, you know,
you broke my heart.

1346
01:04:30,875 --> 01:04:33,639
I... I should be royally
ticked off at you, you know.

1347
01:04:33,711 --> 01:04:34,973
I should be really cheesed off.

1348
01:04:35,046 --> 01:04:37,344
I shouldn't want to talk
to you anymore.

1349
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:40,475
Ooh, what, 'cause I got bored
and had sex with you

1350
01:04:40,551 --> 01:04:42,678
and I didn't want
to, like, marry you?

1351
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:44,687
Like I'd marry you?
You'd be the meanest wife ever,

1352
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:47,155
okay? And I know that you
weren't bored that day,

1353
01:04:47,224 --> 01:04:49,089
because there was a lot
of stuff on TV,

1354
01:04:49,160 --> 01:04:52,095
and-and the <i>Blair Witch Project</i>
was coming on Starz.

1355
01:04:52,163 --> 01:04:54,495
And you were like, "I haven't
seen this since it came out."

1356
01:04:54,565 --> 01:04:55,930
And if so, we should watch it.

1357
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:58,662
And then but, "Oh, no, we should
make out instead," la, la, la.

1358
01:05:00,137 --> 01:05:03,038
You just, you just take Katrina
the douche packer to prom.

1359
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:06,372
I'm, I'm sure you two will have,
like, a real bitchin' time.

1360
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:09,379
Well, I still have your underwear.

1361
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,381
I still...
I have your virginity.

1362
01:05:11,449 --> 01:05:13,508
Would you shut up?

1363
01:05:13,584 --> 01:05:15,108
What, are you ashamed
that we did it?

1364
01:05:15,186 --> 01:05:16,448
No.

1365
01:05:16,520 --> 01:05:17,885
Because at least
you don't have to have

1366
01:05:17,955 --> 01:05:19,923
the evidence under your sweater.

1367
01:05:21,759 --> 01:05:24,091
I'm a planet.

1368
01:05:27,031 --> 01:05:28,555
Wait, wait, let me get your bag.

1369
01:05:28,632 --> 01:05:29,724
You shouldn't be carrying...

1370
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,290
What's another ten pounds?

1371
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:45,581
Monday morning wake up

1372
01:05:45,649 --> 01:05:48,209
Knowing that
you got to go to school

1373
01:05:48,285 --> 01:05:49,877
Tell you mum what to expect

1374
01:05:49,954 --> 01:05:52,218
She says it's right out
of the blue

1375
01:05:52,289 --> 01:05:54,154
Do you want to work
in Debenham's?

1376
01:05:54,225 --> 01:05:56,090
'Cause that's
what they expect

1377
01:05:56,160 --> 01:06:00,187
Start in lingerie,
and Doris is your supervisor

1378
01:06:03,901 --> 01:06:06,233
And the head said
that you always

1379
01:06:06,303 --> 01:06:08,362
Were a queer one
from the start

1380
01:06:08,439 --> 01:06:12,375
For careers, you say you want
to be remembered for your art

1381
01:06:12,443 --> 01:06:14,138
Your obsession gets you known

1382
01:06:14,211 --> 01:06:16,304
Throughout the school
for being strange

1383
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,574
Making life-size models...

1384
01:06:17,648 --> 01:06:19,240
-Hi. Wow.
-Hi.

1385
01:06:19,316 --> 01:06:20,544
Shirt's working hard.

1386
01:06:20,618 --> 01:06:21,642
Is Vanessa here?

1387
01:06:21,719 --> 01:06:23,346
No. We are safe.

1388
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:24,853
Sweet.

1389
01:06:24,922 --> 01:06:26,355
I'm glad you're here.

1390
01:06:26,423 --> 01:06:28,891
I actually have something
for you. Come here.

1391
01:06:28,959 --> 01:06:31,894
And the rumor is you never go
with boys and you are tight...

1392
01:06:31,962 --> 01:06:33,054
Almost there.

1393
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:34,688
So they jab you with a fork

1394
01:06:34,765 --> 01:06:36,562
You drop the tray
and go berserk...

1395
01:06:36,634 --> 01:06:38,966
Whoa, Mark, is this the baby's room?

1396
01:06:39,036 --> 01:06:40,128
It's beautiful.

1397
01:06:40,204 --> 01:06:41,637
Oh, that's hilarious.

1398
01:06:41,705 --> 01:06:44,697
Now, this is where I keep
all my old comics,

1399
01:06:44,775 --> 01:06:46,333
-Huh.
-And I want to show you one.

1400
01:06:46,410 --> 01:06:47,741
You're one of those guys?

1401
01:06:47,811 --> 01:06:49,745
Take a look.

1402
01:06:49,813 --> 01:06:51,371
Huh?

1403
01:06:52,416 --> 01:06:54,646
<i>Most Fruitful Yuki.</i>

1404
01:06:54,718 --> 01:06:55,742
Mm-hmm.

1405
01:06:55,819 --> 01:06:57,753
Is this a pregnant superhero?

1406
01:06:57,821 --> 01:06:59,049
Isn't that great?

1407
01:06:59,123 --> 01:07:00,750
I found it in Japan
when I was there with my band.

1408
01:07:00,824 --> 01:07:01,813
It reminds me of you.

1409
01:07:01,892 --> 01:07:04,326
-Hells, yeah!
-Yeah.

1410
01:07:04,395 --> 01:07:08,126
This actually makes me feel
way less of a fat dork.

1411
01:07:08,199 --> 01:07:10,793
Well, Yuki is a real bad-ass.

1412
01:07:10,868 --> 01:07:13,268
You should be very proud
to be in the same condition.

1413
01:07:13,337 --> 01:07:16,363
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

1414
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:17,566
Oh, how about some tuneage?

1415
01:07:17,641 --> 01:07:19,199
-Tuneage?
-Yeah.

1416
01:07:19,276 --> 01:07:21,471
-I got a bunch...
-All right, don't look<i>. Número trois.</i>

1417
01:07:21,545 --> 01:07:22,739
Not looking.

1418
01:07:22,813 --> 01:07:25,714
Um, okay, this one
is actually kind of slow,

1419
01:07:25,783 --> 01:07:29,742
but it's Mott The Hoople,
so it's still totally rad...

1420
01:07:29,820 --> 01:07:31,253
and hardcore.

1421
01:07:35,492 --> 01:07:36,925
-What?
-I know this one.

1422
01:07:36,994 --> 01:07:38,188
-You do?
-Yeah.

1423
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:40,696
This song is older than I am,
if you can believe it.

1424
01:07:40,764 --> 01:07:42,493
I danced to this at my senior prom.

1425
01:07:42,566 --> 01:07:45,126
Who'd you dance with?

1426
01:07:45,202 --> 01:07:47,932
Cynthia Vogel.
Great dance partner.

1427
01:07:48,005 --> 01:07:50,200
-She let me put my hands all over her butt.
-Hot.

1428
01:07:50,274 --> 01:07:51,332
Very hot.

1429
01:07:51,408 --> 01:07:55,242
I can just totally
picture you dancing

1430
01:07:55,312 --> 01:07:57,371
like a total dork.

1431
01:07:57,448 --> 01:08:00,008
Actually...

1432
01:08:00,084 --> 01:08:02,484
her hands...

1433
01:08:02,553 --> 01:08:03,815
were there.

1434
01:08:03,887 --> 01:08:05,616
I put my hands down here.

1435
01:08:05,689 --> 01:08:08,317
Th-this, this... this
is how we did it in '88.

1436
01:08:08,392 --> 01:08:09,723
-Like this?
-Just like this.

1437
01:08:09,793 --> 01:08:11,658
Have you ever been
to a dance before?

1438
01:08:11,729 --> 01:08:14,289
Dances are for nerds and squares.

1439
01:08:15,466 --> 01:08:16,899
What are you?

1440
01:08:16,967 --> 01:08:19,060
I don't know.

1441
01:08:20,404 --> 01:08:22,338
Does it feel like there's
something between us?

1442
01:08:24,174 --> 01:08:28,235
-<i>All the young dudes</i>
-Hey, dudes

1443
01:08:28,312 --> 01:08:30,746
<i>Carry the news</i>

1444
01:08:30,814 --> 01:08:32,509
Where are you?

1445
01:08:32,583 --> 01:08:34,414
Stand up

1446
01:08:34,485 --> 01:08:37,579
<i>Carry the news</i>

1447
01:08:39,623 --> 01:08:41,784
I'm leaving Vanessa.

1448
01:08:41,859 --> 01:08:44,419
<i>Carry the news</i>

1449
01:08:44,495 --> 01:08:46,622
-What?!
-Getting a place in the city.

1450
01:08:46,697 --> 01:08:48,187
Got it all planned.

1451
01:08:48,265 --> 01:08:50,859
This is something I've been
wanting to do for a long time.

1452
01:08:50,934 --> 01:08:52,128
-No.
-No?

1453
01:08:52,202 --> 01:08:54,397
No, you definitely...
can't do that.

1454
01:08:54,471 --> 01:08:57,440
That's one big, fat sack of... no!

1455
01:08:57,508 --> 01:09:00,033
-What is the matter?
-Wh?di?I...

1456
01:09:00,110 --> 01:09:03,944
I mean... you guys are supposed
to take care of this, you know?

1457
01:09:05,282 --> 01:09:07,716
-I thought you'd be cool with this.
-Cool?

1458
01:09:07,785 --> 01:09:10,379
I-I want things to be perfect.

1459
01:09:10,454 --> 01:09:12,718
I don't want them to be
shitty and broken

1460
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,382
like everyone else's family.

1461
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:17,624
Look, I'll have the baby,

1462
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,993
and Vanessa's going to be so happy.

1463
01:09:20,064 --> 01:09:21,463
You just...

1464
01:09:21,532 --> 01:09:23,557
A baby's not going to fix
everything, besides I don't know

1465
01:09:23,634 --> 01:09:25,124
if I'm even ready to be a father.

1466
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:26,191
But you're old.

1467
01:09:30,507 --> 01:09:32,134
How do you think of me?

1468
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:34,777
You know, why are you over here?

1469
01:09:37,948 --> 01:09:41,213
I... I just like being

1470
01:09:41,285 --> 01:09:43,719
a piece of furniture
in your weird life.

1471
01:09:43,787 --> 01:09:45,914
This? This is what
my life has become.

1472
01:09:45,989 --> 01:09:48,457
I mean, you know,
I got stuff in boxes.

1473
01:09:48,525 --> 01:09:49,549
You know, I'm underground.

1474
01:09:49,626 --> 01:09:51,253
That's appealing to you?

1475
01:09:51,328 --> 01:09:52,659
-Is this my fault?
-No.

1476
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:55,164
Is Vanessa, like, mad at you
because of me or something?

1477
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:56,494
That's got nothing to do with it.

1478
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:57,795
Vanessa and I aren't
in love anymore.

1479
01:09:57,868 --> 01:09:59,836
Well, you were in love
when you married her.

1480
01:09:59,903 --> 01:10:02,497
And if you're in love once,
you can be in love again

1481
01:10:02,573 --> 01:10:04,632
like my friend, Leah,
who's been with the same guy,

1482
01:10:04,708 --> 01:10:06,232
like, four different times.

1483
01:10:06,310 --> 01:10:08,278
-You're just not trying hard enough.
-I'm such an idiot.

1484
01:10:08,345 --> 01:10:09,573
I can't believe what an idiot I am.

1485
01:10:09,646 --> 01:10:10,738
No, no, you know what, Mark...

1486
01:10:10,814 --> 01:10:14,341
Just do not divorce your wife.

1487
01:10:14,418 --> 01:10:16,579
Will you please
just do me a solid

1488
01:10:16,653 --> 01:10:18,314
and stay with Vanessa?

1489
01:10:19,823 --> 01:10:20,983
You're so young.

1490
01:10:21,058 --> 01:10:23,049
Oh, I'm not that young.
Okay, I'm 16.

1491
01:10:23,127 --> 01:10:24,924
All right, I'm old enough
to know when someone's

1492
01:10:24,995 --> 01:10:26,690
acting like a total a-hole.

1493
01:10:26,764 --> 01:10:28,959
Oh, and you know what?

1494
01:10:29,032 --> 01:10:31,830
I bought another Sonic Youth
album and it sucks!

1495
01:10:31,902 --> 01:10:33,563
It's just noise.

1496
01:10:38,008 --> 01:10:40,272
Juno? What's going on?

1497
01:10:40,344 --> 01:10:42,608
Nothing.

1498
01:10:42,679 --> 01:10:44,476
Why are you crying?

1499
01:10:44,548 --> 01:10:46,038
I'm not crying,

1500
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:48,607
I'm just allergic
to fine home furnishings.

1501
01:10:48,685 --> 01:10:50,619
Hold on. What's the matter?

1502
01:10:50,687 --> 01:10:51,813
What's the matter?

1503
01:10:51,889 --> 01:10:53,789
Just a little hormonal.

1504
01:10:53,857 --> 01:10:55,051
Right, Juno?

1505
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:57,616
Just part of the process.

1506
01:11:01,198 --> 01:11:02,563
What did you do?

1507
01:11:04,601 --> 01:11:06,000
I didn't do anything.

1508
01:11:06,069 --> 01:11:09,061
Just, um...

1509
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,902
I've been thinking...

1510
01:11:14,978 --> 01:11:16,468
-What?
-You know, I've just?

1511
01:11:16,547 --> 01:11:19,072
I'm thinking if this
is the right thing.

1512
01:11:19,149 --> 01:11:21,447
What are you talking about?

1513
01:11:22,820 --> 01:11:24,981
Just wondering if it's...

1514
01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:26,386
just wondering if we're ready.

1515
01:11:26,457 --> 01:11:28,925
Yeah, we're ready.

1516
01:11:28,992 --> 01:11:30,186
We're ready.
We've read the books.

1517
01:11:30,260 --> 01:11:31,454
We've taken all the classes.

1518
01:11:31,528 --> 01:11:33,086
We've have a nursery

1519
01:11:33,163 --> 01:11:34,425
-that is completely...
-Vanessa.

1520
01:11:34,498 --> 01:11:35,863
I know we're prepared.

1521
01:11:35,933 --> 01:11:38,265
I'm just wondering if...

1522
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:41,133
I'm ready.

1523
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:45,530
Wait a minute.

1524
01:11:45,609 --> 01:11:46,701
Wait, Juno,

1525
01:11:46,777 --> 01:11:47,766
don't listen to him.

1526
01:11:47,845 --> 01:11:49,278
He's just got cold feet.

1527
01:11:49,346 --> 01:11:50,836
He's just being a guy.

1528
01:11:50,914 --> 01:11:52,541
The books all say the same thing.

1529
01:11:52,616 --> 01:11:54,709
"A woman becomes a mother
when she gets pregnant.

1530
01:11:54,785 --> 01:11:57,379
A man becomes a father
when he sees his baby."

1531
01:11:57,454 --> 01:11:59,354
He's going to get there.

1532
01:11:59,423 --> 01:12:01,948
-He's... he's going to get there.
-It happened so fast.

1533
01:12:02,025 --> 01:12:03,822
You know, we put
the ad in the paper

1534
01:12:03,894 --> 01:12:06,795
and I thought that it was going
to take months, if at all,

1535
01:12:06,864 --> 01:12:08,889
and then, two weeks later,
she's on that couch.

1536
01:12:08,966 --> 01:12:10,627
Well, she answered our prayers.

1537
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:14,000
Ever since then, it's been,
like, a ticking clock.

1538
01:12:16,373 --> 01:12:18,898
What are you saying?

1539
01:12:20,944 --> 01:12:23,174
That it feels a little
like bad timing.

1540
01:12:26,817 --> 01:12:29,479
What would be a good time
for you, Mark?

1541
01:12:30,988 --> 01:12:33,115
There's just some things
that I still want to do.

1542
01:12:33,190 --> 01:12:35,920
Like what? Be a rock star?

1543
01:12:35,993 --> 01:12:37,984
Don't mock me.

1544
01:12:39,363 --> 01:12:41,763
I'm just saying that this is...

1545
01:12:41,832 --> 01:12:43,823
this is something
that's never going to happen.

1546
01:12:45,669 --> 01:12:47,864
You know...

1547
01:12:47,938 --> 01:12:49,462
your shirt is stupid.

1548
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:51,770
Grow up.

1549
01:12:51,842 --> 01:12:54,538
If I have to wait for you
to become Kurt Cobain,

1550
01:12:54,611 --> 01:12:56,511
I'm never going to be a mother.

1551
01:13:00,183 --> 01:13:02,743
I never said I'd be a good father.

1552
01:15:57,994 --> 01:16:00,326
I called Gerta Rouse
and she said that

1553
01:16:00,397 --> 01:16:02,365
she can represent both of us.

1554
01:16:02,432 --> 01:16:04,263
It's called
a "collaborative divorce."

1555
01:16:04,334 --> 01:16:07,428
It's all the rage
right now, supposedly.

1556
01:16:07,504 --> 01:16:08,664
It'd be pretty easy

1557
01:16:08,739 --> 01:16:09,967
'cause we don't have any children.

1558
01:16:10,040 --> 01:16:12,474
Thanks for making the call, I guess.

1559
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,509
Have you found a place to stay yet?

1560
01:16:21,585 --> 01:16:23,212
Yeah, downtown.

1561
01:16:23,286 --> 01:16:24,480
A hotel?

1562
01:16:24,554 --> 01:16:26,545
No, it's not a hotel, it's a loft.

1563
01:16:27,958 --> 01:16:29,653
Well, aren't you the cool guy.

1564
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:37,191
I wanted a baby so bad.

1565
01:16:37,267 --> 01:16:39,258
I know.

1566
01:16:58,054 --> 01:16:59,885
This looks like a bill from Jun...

1567
01:16:59,956 --> 01:17:02,117
It's for me.

1568
01:17:42,799 --> 01:17:45,563
<i>I never realize</i>
<i>how much I like being home</i>

1569
01:17:45,635 --> 01:17:49,435
<i>unless I've been somewhere</i>
<i>really different for a while.</i>

1570
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,442
Hey, Dad.

1571
01:17:58,515 --> 01:18:00,779
Hey, big puffy version of June bug.

1572
01:18:00,851 --> 01:18:02,819
Where you been?

1573
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:06,583
Oh, just out dealing with things
way beyond my maturity level.

1574
01:18:08,558 --> 01:18:10,321
Where is everybody?

1575
01:18:10,393 --> 01:18:14,159
Well, Bren took Liberty Bell
to her tot ice-skating class.

1576
01:18:14,231 --> 01:18:18,292
When will you guys learn
that tots can't ice-skate?

1577
01:18:19,402 --> 01:18:21,495
You're looking
a little morose, honey.

1578
01:18:21,571 --> 01:18:22,936
What's eating you?

1579
01:18:23,006 --> 01:18:25,406
Oh...

1580
01:18:30,747 --> 01:18:34,239
I'm just, like, losing
my faith with humanity.

1581
01:18:34,317 --> 01:18:36,945
Wow, can you narrow that down
for me?

1582
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:40,786
I just... wonder if, like,

1583
01:18:40,857 --> 01:18:44,588
two people can
stay together for good.

1584
01:18:44,661 --> 01:18:46,925
You mean, like couples?

1585
01:18:46,997 --> 01:18:49,795
Yeah, like...
people in love.

1586
01:18:49,866 --> 01:18:51,333
Are you having boy trouble?

1587
01:18:51,401 --> 01:18:53,869
'Cause I got to be honest,
I don't really much approve

1588
01:18:53,937 --> 01:18:55,598
of you dating in your condition.

1589
01:18:55,672 --> 01:18:58,038
That's...
that's kind of messed up.

1590
01:18:58,108 --> 01:19:00,372
-No, Dad, it's not...
-I mean, that's pretty skanky.

1591
01:19:00,443 --> 01:19:02,968
Isn't that what
you girls call it?skanky?

1592
01:19:03,046 --> 01:19:04,104
-Skivvy?
-Please stop.

1593
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:05,442
Tore up from the floor up?

1594
01:19:05,515 --> 01:19:08,382
That's... that's
not what it's about, it...

1595
01:19:11,354 --> 01:19:14,653
I just... I need to know
that it's possible

1596
01:19:14,724 --> 01:19:18,626
that two people can stay happy
together forever.

1597
01:19:18,695 --> 01:19:21,892
Well, it's not easy,
that's for sure.

1598
01:19:21,965 --> 01:19:24,627
And, uh, I don't have the best
track record in the world,

1599
01:19:24,701 --> 01:19:26,328
I know, but...

1600
01:19:26,403 --> 01:19:28,564
I've been with your stepmother
for ten years now,

1601
01:19:28,638 --> 01:19:31,573
and, um, I'm proud to say,
we're very happy.

1602
01:19:32,742 --> 01:19:34,539
Look...

1603
01:19:34,611 --> 01:19:39,480
in my opinion, the best thing
you can do is find a person

1604
01:19:39,549 --> 01:19:43,815
who loves you
for exactly what you are.

1605
01:19:43,887 --> 01:19:46,185
Good mood, bad mood...

1606
01:19:46,256 --> 01:19:48,690
ugly, pretty...

1607
01:19:48,758 --> 01:19:50,282
handsome, what have you.

1608
01:19:50,360 --> 01:19:52,191
The right person's
still gonna think

1609
01:19:52,262 --> 01:19:54,253
the sun shines out your ass.

1610
01:19:57,600 --> 01:20:00,660
That's the kind of person
that's worth sticking with.

1611
01:20:00,737 --> 01:20:02,466
Yeah.

1612
01:20:04,774 --> 01:20:08,540
Yeah, and I think
I've found that person.

1613
01:20:08,611 --> 01:20:10,841
Yeah, sure you have?
your dear old D-A-D.

1614
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:15,374
You know I'll always be there
to love you and support you

1615
01:20:15,452 --> 01:20:17,079
no matter what kind of pickle
you're in.

1616
01:20:17,153 --> 01:20:18,745
Obviously.

1617
01:20:23,927 --> 01:20:26,862
Dad, I think I'm just gonna
like... shove out for a sec,

1618
01:20:26,930 --> 01:20:29,296
but I won't be home late.

1619
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,266
Okay.

1620
01:20:31,334 --> 01:20:33,393
You were talking about me, right?

1621
01:20:33,470 --> 01:20:35,938
Oh, yeah.

1622
01:20:45,582 --> 01:20:48,676
-Come on!
-Tic tac ahoy!

1623
01:20:56,659 --> 01:20:59,219
The flower said,
"I wish I was a tree"

1624
01:20:59,295 --> 01:21:03,527
The tree said, "I wish I could
be a different kind of tree"

1625
01:21:03,600 --> 01:21:06,068
The cat wished
that it was a bee

1626
01:21:06,136 --> 01:21:08,468
The turtle wished
that it could fly

1627
01:21:08,538 --> 01:21:10,870
Really high into the sky

1628
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:15,434
Over rooftops and then dive
deep into the sea

1629
01:21:15,512 --> 01:21:17,707
And in the sea
there is a fish

1630
01:21:17,781 --> 01:21:20,181
A fish that has
a secret wish

1631
01:21:20,250 --> 01:21:25,017
A wish to be a big cactus
with a pink flower on it

1632
01:21:25,088 --> 01:21:27,318
And in the sea
there is a fish

1633
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,551
A fish that has
a secret wish

1634
01:21:29,626 --> 01:21:32,356
A wish to be a big cactus
with a pink flower on it...

1635
01:21:32,429 --> 01:21:33,589
Hi.

1636
01:21:33,663 --> 01:21:35,494
Hey, did you put, like,

1637
01:21:35,565 --> 01:21:37,863
a hundred things of
tic tacs in my mailbox?

1638
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:40,095
Oh, yeah. Yeah, that was me.

1639
01:21:40,170 --> 01:21:41,398
Why?

1640
01:21:41,471 --> 01:21:43,701
Well, you know,
they're your fave,

1641
01:21:43,773 --> 01:21:45,968
and, uh, I mean, you can never
have too many of your favorite

1642
01:21:46,042 --> 01:21:47,100
one-calorie breath mints.

1643
01:21:47,177 --> 01:21:48,405
So, I just thought I'd...

1644
01:21:48,478 --> 01:21:49,604
Yeah, well, thanks.

1645
01:21:49,679 --> 01:21:51,772
I, uh, I think
I'm pretty much set

1646
01:21:51,848 --> 01:21:54,339
until college on the tic tac front.

1647
01:21:54,417 --> 01:21:56,112
You know, Bleek, I was thinking...

1648
01:21:56,186 --> 01:21:58,950
and I'm sorry
I was such a huge bitch to you.

1649
01:21:59,022 --> 01:22:00,489
You don't deserve it.

1650
01:22:00,557 --> 01:22:03,549
It's okay, you know...
it's okay.

1651
01:22:03,626 --> 01:22:07,756
And also, um...

1652
01:22:07,831 --> 01:22:10,197
I think I'm in love with you.

1653
01:22:12,135 --> 01:22:13,864
You mean, as friends?

1654
01:22:13,937 --> 01:22:17,100
No. I mean, for real.

1655
01:22:17,173 --> 01:22:21,803
'Cause you're, like, the coolest
person I've ever met,

1656
01:22:21,878 --> 01:22:25,211
and you don't even have to try.

1657
01:22:25,281 --> 01:22:27,875
I try really hard, actually.

1658
01:22:27,951 --> 01:22:30,146
You're, like, naturally smart,

1659
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:32,188
and you're not like everyone else.

1660
01:22:32,255 --> 01:22:34,450
You don't stare
at my stomach all the time.

1661
01:22:34,524 --> 01:22:37,687
You look at my face,
and every time I see you,

1662
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:41,890
the baby starts kicking super hard.

1663
01:22:41,965 --> 01:22:43,523
It does?

1664
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:55,277
Wizard.

1665
01:22:55,345 --> 01:22:57,870
I think it's 'cause
my heart starts pounding

1666
01:22:57,947 --> 01:22:59,744
every time I see you.

1667
01:22:59,816 --> 01:23:02,751
Mine, too.

1668
01:23:02,819 --> 01:23:08,223
That's all I could ask for.

1669
01:23:08,291 --> 01:23:11,055
You're golden, man.

1670
01:23:13,062 --> 01:23:14,927
Can we make out now?

1671
01:23:16,399 --> 01:23:17,559
Yeah.

1672
01:23:17,634 --> 01:23:20,068
I like boys
with strong convictions

1673
01:23:20,136 --> 01:23:22,366
And convicts
with perfect diction

1674
01:23:22,438 --> 01:23:24,599
Underdogs
with good intentions

1675
01:23:24,674 --> 01:23:26,869
Amputees
with stamp collections

1676
01:23:26,943 --> 01:23:28,672
I like boys
that like their mothers

1677
01:23:28,745 --> 01:23:30,212
And I have a thing for...

1678
01:23:30,280 --> 01:23:31,440
Hey, you know,

1679
01:23:31,548 --> 01:23:34,574
you could go into early labor
sucking face like that.

1680
01:23:34,651 --> 01:23:36,243
We're not lovers

1681
01:23:40,523 --> 01:23:43,048
You're so nice

1682
01:23:43,293 --> 01:23:45,625
And you're so smart

1683
01:23:45,695 --> 01:23:49,995
You're such a good friend,
I have to break your heart

1684
01:23:50,066 --> 01:23:52,091
I'll tell you
that I love you

1685
01:23:52,168 --> 01:23:54,295
Then I'll tear your world
apart

1686
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:57,533
Just pretend I didn't tear
your world apart...

1687
01:23:57,607 --> 01:23:59,302
Dad!

1688
01:23:59,375 --> 01:24:01,502
What?!

1689
01:24:01,578 --> 01:24:04,012
Dad, either I just peed my pants
or, um...

1690
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,674
Or?!

1691
01:24:06,749 --> 01:24:09,343
Thundercats are go!

1692
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:10,477
Fall out! Fall out!

1693
01:24:10,553 --> 01:24:11,952
You okay?

1694
01:24:12,021 --> 01:24:13,750
-Do you have the admittance form?
-Got 'em!

1695
01:24:13,823 --> 01:24:14,915
What about the parking stickers?

1696
01:24:14,991 --> 01:24:16,151
I got 'em!
You got Liberty Bell?!

1697
01:24:16,226 --> 01:24:18,353
Oh, Liberty Bell.
Oh, sweetie, sweetie, sweetie!

1698
01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:20,362
You're so nice
and you're so smart

1699
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:22,489
We're gonna have a baby!
Yeah! Here we go!

1700
01:24:22,565 --> 01:24:25,591
You're such a good friend
I have to break your heart

1701
01:24:25,668 --> 01:24:27,067
All right, go!

1702
01:24:27,136 --> 01:24:29,104
-I'll tell you that I love you
-Aah!

1703
01:24:29,172 --> 01:24:30,639
-Aah!
-And I'll tear your world apart

1704
01:24:30,707 --> 01:24:33,767
Just pretend I didn't tear
your world apart...

1705
01:24:33,843 --> 01:24:34,901
Breathe! Breathe!

1706
01:24:34,978 --> 01:24:37,037
Out of the way!
Out of the way!

1707
01:24:37,113 --> 01:24:39,308
Stop it. For God's sake, stop it.

1708
01:24:39,382 --> 01:24:40,940
-Don't do that.
-What?

1709
01:24:41,017 --> 01:24:43,850
-Don't...
-But it's fun!

1710
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:45,285
Ow, ow, fuckity, ow!

1711
01:24:45,355 --> 01:24:48,222
God, Bren, when do I get
the friggin' spinal tap thing?!

1712
01:24:48,291 --> 01:24:49,315
It's called
a spinal block,

1713
01:24:49,392 --> 01:24:50,791
and you can't have it yet, honey.

1714
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:53,124
The doctor said you're
not dilated enough.

1715
01:24:53,196 --> 01:24:54,959
Oh, come on!
I mean, it's like...

1716
01:24:55,031 --> 01:24:57,090
I have to wait for it to get worse?

1717
01:24:57,166 --> 01:24:59,225
Why can't I just have
the friggin' thing now?

1718
01:24:59,302 --> 01:25:01,497
Well, honey, doctors are sadists
who like to play God

1719
01:25:01,571 --> 01:25:03,129
and watch lesser people scream.

1720
01:25:04,340 --> 01:25:06,570
Oh, shit!
Uh, excuse me!

1721
01:25:06,643 --> 01:25:08,736
Hey, could we give my kid
the damn spinal tap already?!

1722
01:25:08,811 --> 01:25:11,075
<i>-Breath and push.</i>

1723
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:12,671
-That's good.
-Keep pushing.

1724
01:25:12,749 --> 01:25:16,116
Keep pushing, keep pushing...

1725
01:25:21,357 --> 01:25:24,758
You're a part-time lover
and a full-time friend

1726
01:25:24,827 --> 01:25:28,160
The monkey on your back
is the latest trend

1727
01:25:28,231 --> 01:25:34,192
I don't see what anyone
can see in anyone else

1728
01:25:34,270 --> 01:25:38,001
-But you...
-I kiss you on the brain
in the shadow of the train...

1729
01:25:39,309 --> 01:25:45,214
<i>And then, out of nowhere, there it was...</i>

1730
01:25:45,281 --> 01:25:48,216
<i>there he was.</i>

1731
01:25:48,284 --> 01:25:50,912
Here is the church
and here is the steeple

1732
01:25:50,987 --> 01:25:53,182
We sure are cute
for two ugly people...

1733
01:25:53,256 --> 01:25:54,621
<i>I decided not to call Bleeker</i>

1734
01:25:54,691 --> 01:25:56,522
<i>to tell him</i>
<i>that I was having the baby.</i>

1735
01:25:56,592 --> 01:25:58,753
<i>He had a big meet</i>
<i>against Manteno</i>

1736
01:25:58,828 --> 01:26:02,457
<i>and I didn't want him</i>
<i>to get all worried about me.</i>

1737
01:26:02,532 --> 01:26:05,330
Paulie Bleeker
has just broken a district record...

1738
01:26:05,401 --> 01:26:08,063
<i>But he figured it out anyway.</i>

1739
01:26:08,137 --> 01:26:14,303
Do, do-do-do, do-do-do,
do-do, do-do

1740
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:16,971
But you.

1741
01:26:25,421 --> 01:26:29,755
Someday, you'll be
back here, honey...

1742
01:26:29,826 --> 01:26:32,590
on your terms.

1743
01:26:42,538 --> 01:26:44,472
Hi.

1744
01:26:44,540 --> 01:26:47,566
Nice legs.

1745
01:27:20,610 --> 01:27:23,545
Come with me

1746
01:27:23,613 --> 01:27:27,208
My love

1747
01:27:27,283 --> 01:27:28,875
To the sea...

1748
01:27:28,951 --> 01:27:32,284
<i>Bleeker decided</i>
<i>he didn't want to see the baby.</i>

1749
01:27:32,355 --> 01:27:34,289
<i>Neither did I really.</i>

1750
01:27:34,357 --> 01:27:37,349
<i>He didn't feel like ours.</i>

1751
01:27:38,928 --> 01:27:42,864
... How much...

1752
01:27:42,932 --> 01:27:45,526
<i>I think he was always hers.</i>

1753
01:27:49,705 --> 01:27:51,673
Would you like to meet your son?

1754
01:27:51,741 --> 01:27:54,539
I have a son.

1755
01:27:55,578 --> 01:28:02,347
Do you remember when we met

1756
01:28:02,418 --> 01:28:05,012
That's the day

1757
01:28:05,087 --> 01:28:08,523
I knew you were my pet

1758
01:28:08,591 --> 01:28:13,528
I wanna tell you...

1759
01:28:13,596 --> 01:28:14,688
I'm gonna...

1760
01:28:14,764 --> 01:28:16,356
How much...

1761
01:28:16,432 --> 01:28:18,366
I'm your...

1762
01:28:18,434 --> 01:28:20,402
-I love you...
-Oh.

1763
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:21,869
Is this?
Am I?

1764
01:28:23,473 --> 01:28:25,065
How do I look?

1765
01:28:25,141 --> 01:28:27,075
Like a new mom.

1766
01:28:27,143 --> 01:28:30,135
Scared shitless.

1767
01:28:32,114 --> 01:28:35,208
Come with me

1768
01:28:35,284 --> 01:28:39,220
My love

1769
01:28:39,288 --> 01:28:41,222
To the sea

1770
01:28:41,290 --> 01:28:44,623
The sea of love

1771
01:28:44,694 --> 01:28:49,631
I wanna tell you

1772
01:28:49,699 --> 01:28:53,795
How much...

1773
01:28:53,870 --> 01:28:55,804
<i>It ended with a chair.</i>

1774
01:28:55,872 --> 01:29:01,139
... I love you

1775
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:04,145
Mm-mm

1776
01:29:04,213 --> 01:29:07,205
Mm-mm...

1777
01:29:31,807 --> 01:29:35,800
I took the Polaroid down
in my room

1778
01:29:35,878 --> 01:29:40,144
I'm pretty sure
you have a new girlfriend

1779
01:29:40,216 --> 01:29:43,982
It's not
as if I don't like you

1780
01:29:44,053 --> 01:29:48,149
It just makes me sad
whenever I see it

1781
01:29:48,224 --> 01:29:52,183
'Cause I like to be gone most
of the time...

1782
01:29:52,261 --> 01:29:56,322
<i>As boyfriends go,</i>
<i>Paulie Bleeker is totally boss.</i>

1783
01:29:56,399 --> 01:29:59,334
<i>He is the cheese to my macaroni.</i>

1784
01:29:59,402 --> 01:30:02,462
<i>And I know people are supposed</i>
<i>to fall in love</i>

1785
01:30:02,538 --> 01:30:04,028
<i>before they reproduce,</i>

1786
01:30:04,106 --> 01:30:07,007
<i>but I guess normalcy</i>
<i>isn't really our style.</i>

1787
01:30:07,076 --> 01:30:09,271
... he didn't want a ride

1788
01:30:09,345 --> 01:30:13,281
And I never met a Toby
that I didn't like...

1789
01:30:13,349 --> 01:30:15,112
Hey.

1790
01:30:15,184 --> 01:30:17,118
Hey.

1791
01:30:17,186 --> 01:30:20,121
... that I recommended,
even if he didn't...

1792
01:30:20,189 --> 01:30:21,781
Ready?

1793
01:30:21,857 --> 01:30:23,347
Yeah.

1794
01:30:34,804 --> 01:30:37,068
You're a part-time
lover

1795
01:30:37,139 --> 01:30:39,073
And a full-time
friend

1796
01:30:39,141 --> 01:30:42,235
The monkey on your back
is the latest trend

1797
01:30:42,311 --> 01:30:44,336
I don't see
what anyone can see

1798
01:30:44,413 --> 01:30:47,678
In anyone else

1799
01:30:47,750 --> 01:30:49,012
But you...

1800
01:30:49,085 --> 01:30:52,077
Here is the church and
here is the steeple

1801
01:30:52,154 --> 01:30:55,487
We sure are cute for
two ugly people

1802
01:30:55,558 --> 01:30:57,651
I don't see what
anyone can see

1803
01:30:57,727 --> 01:31:00,321
In anyone else

1804
01:31:00,396 --> 01:31:02,057
But you...

1805
01:31:02,131 --> 01:31:05,066
We both have shiny
happy fits of rage

1806
01:31:05,134 --> 01:31:08,399
I want more fans,
you want more stage

1807
01:31:08,471 --> 01:31:10,837
I don't see
what anyone can see

1808
01:31:10,906 --> 01:31:13,500
In anyone else

1809
01:31:13,576 --> 01:31:15,339
But you...

1810
01:31:15,411 --> 01:31:18,346
You're always trying
to keep it real

1811
01:31:18,414 --> 01:31:21,679
And I'm in love with
how you feel

1812
01:31:21,751 --> 01:31:24,276
I don't see what
anyone can see

1813
01:31:24,353 --> 01:31:27,288
In anyone else

1814
01:31:27,356 --> 01:31:28,618
But you...

1815
01:31:28,691 --> 01:31:31,626
I kiss you on the brain
in the shadow of a train

1816
01:31:31,694 --> 01:31:33,286
I kiss you
all starry-eyed

1817
01:31:33,362 --> 01:31:35,193
My body swings
from side to side

1818
01:31:35,264 --> 01:31:37,425
I don't see
what anyone can see

1819
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:40,264
In anyone else

1820
01:31:40,336 --> 01:31:41,928
But you...

1821
01:31:42,004 --> 01:31:44,939
The pebbles forgive me,
the trees forgive me

1822
01:31:45,007 --> 01:31:48,272
So why can't
you forgive me?

1823
01:31:48,344 --> 01:31:50,778
I don't see what
anyone can see

1824
01:31:50,846 --> 01:31:53,940
In anyone else

1825
01:31:54,016 --> 01:31:55,278
But you...

1826
01:31:55,351 --> 01:31:58,286
Do, do-do-do, do-do-do,
do-do, do-do

1827
01:31:58,354 --> 01:32:01,619
Do, do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do, do-do

1828
01:32:01,691 --> 01:32:04,125
I don't see
what anyone can see

1829
01:32:04,193 --> 01:32:07,390
In anyone else

1830
01:32:07,463 --> 01:32:10,455
But you.

1831
01:32:33,189 --> 01:32:35,783
Loose lips might sink ships
but loose gooses take trips

1832
01:32:35,858 --> 01:32:37,450
To San Francisco
double Dutch disco

1833
01:32:37,526 --> 01:32:39,323
Tech TV hottie,
do it for Scotty

1834
01:32:39,395 --> 01:32:41,226
Do it for the living
and do it for the dead

1835
01:32:41,297 --> 01:32:42,696
Do it for the monsters
under your bed

1836
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:44,323
Do it for the teenagers
and do it for your mom

1837
01:32:44,400 --> 01:32:46,163
Broken hearts hurt
but they make us strong and

1838
01:32:46,235 --> 01:32:48,499
We won't stop
until somebody calls the cops

1839
01:32:48,571 --> 01:32:50,163
And even then
we'll start again

1840
01:32:50,239 --> 01:32:52,332
And just pretend
that nothing ever happened

1841
01:32:52,408 --> 01:32:54,808
We won't stop
until somebody calls the cops

1842
01:32:54,877 --> 01:32:56,469
And even then
we'll start again

1843
01:32:56,545 --> 01:32:58,638
And just pretend
that nothing ever happened

1844
01:32:58,714 --> 01:33:00,306
We're just dancing,
we're just hugging

1845
01:33:00,382 --> 01:33:01,974
Singing, screaming,
kissing, tugging

1846
01:33:02,051 --> 01:33:04,246
On the sleeve
of how it used to be

1847
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:05,480
How's it gonna be?

1848
01:33:05,554 --> 01:33:06,919
I'll drop kick
Russell Stover

1849
01:33:06,989 --> 01:33:08,547
Move into the <i>Starting Over</i>
house

1850
01:33:08,624 --> 01:33:10,649
You know Matt Rouse
and Jest are watching me

1851
01:33:10,726 --> 01:33:12,057
Achieve my dreams

1852
01:33:12,128 --> 01:33:15,063
While we strive to figure out
a way we can survive

1853
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:17,895
These trying times
without losing our minds

1854
01:33:17,967 --> 01:33:19,730
Shysters live
from scheme to scheme

1855
01:33:19,802 --> 01:33:22,168
But my 4th quarter pipe dreams
are seeming more

1856
01:33:22,238 --> 01:33:24,172
And more worth fighting for

1857
01:33:24,240 --> 01:33:26,174
My war paint is Sharpie ink

1858
01:33:26,242 --> 01:33:27,937
And I'll show you
how much my shit stinks

1859
01:33:28,010 --> 01:33:29,409
And ask you what you think

1860
01:33:29,478 --> 01:33:31,275
Because your thoughts
and words are powerful

1861
01:33:31,347 --> 01:33:32,939
They think we're disposable

1862
01:33:33,015 --> 01:33:34,607
Well both my thumbs
opposable

1863
01:33:34,683 --> 01:33:37,948
Spelled out on a double word
and triple letter score and

1864
01:33:38,020 --> 01:33:40,784
We won't stop
until somebody calls the cops

1865
01:33:40,856 --> 01:33:42,448
And even then
we'll start again

1866
01:33:42,525 --> 01:33:44,755
And just pretend
that nothing ever happened

1867
01:33:44,827 --> 01:33:47,421
We won't stop
until somebody calls the cops

1868
01:33:47,496 --> 01:33:49,088
And even then
we'll start again

1869
01:33:49,165 --> 01:33:51,429
And just pretend
that nothing ever happened

1870
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:53,092
We're just dancing,
we're just hugging

1871
01:33:53,169 --> 01:33:54,761
Singing, screaming,
kissing, tugging

1872
01:33:54,837 --> 01:33:57,704
On the sleeve
of how it used to be.

1873
01:34:45,955 --> 01:34:48,219
I am a vampire,
I am a vampire

1874
01:34:48,290 --> 01:34:50,554
I am a vampire, I am
a vampire

1875
01:34:50,626 --> 01:34:53,094
I am a vampire, vampire,
I am a vampire

1876
01:34:53,162 --> 01:34:55,426
I have lost my fangs

1877
01:34:55,497 --> 01:34:58,091
I am a vampire,
I am a vampire

1878
01:34:58,167 --> 01:34:59,498
I am a vampire

1879
01:34:59,568 --> 01:35:01,832
I have lost my fangs

1880
01:35:01,904 --> 01:35:04,168
So I'm sad and I feel lonely

1881
01:35:04,240 --> 01:35:06,674
So I cry and I'm very angry

1882
01:35:06,742 --> 01:35:09,176
And I ate some garlic

1883
01:35:09,245 --> 01:35:11,440
So I'm no more sad and ache

1884
01:35:11,513 --> 01:35:13,276
Yeah, yeah, I am a vampire

1885
01:35:13,349 --> 01:35:15,943
And I'm looking in the city
for the pretty girls

1886
01:35:16,018 --> 01:35:17,212
Don't look at me

1887
01:35:17,286 --> 01:35:18,480
Don't look at me

1888
01:35:18,554 --> 01:35:20,818
'Cause I don't
have my fangs

1889
01:35:20,890 --> 01:35:23,825
'Cause I have lost my fangs

1890
01:35:23,893 --> 01:35:27,158
I am a vampire,
I am a vampire

1891
01:35:27,229 --> 01:35:29,823
I have lost my mouth again

1892
01:35:29,899 --> 01:35:32,333
I am a vampire,
I am a vampire

1893
01:35:32,401 --> 01:35:34,665
I have lost my mouth again

1894
01:35:34,737 --> 01:35:37,001
So I get one and I slept

1895
01:35:37,072 --> 01:35:39,506
So I eat popcorn
and I brood and wait

1896
01:35:39,575 --> 01:35:41,839
And I sing
with my best friend the king

1897
01:35:41,911 --> 01:35:44,675
And I want to play
the guitar

1898
01:35:44,747 --> 01:35:47,341
But my guitar is out
of tune

1899
01:35:47,416 --> 01:35:48,781
I am a vampire

1900
01:35:48,851 --> 01:35:50,682
And I'm looking
in the city but the musical

1901
01:35:50,753 --> 01:35:52,516
Don't play with me

1902
01:35:52,588 --> 01:35:53,782
Don't play with me

1903
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:56,154
'Cause I don't have my mouth
again

1904
01:35:56,225 --> 01:36:00,161
'Cause I have lost my mouth
again.
