1
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,106
It started with a chair.

2
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:16,372
I've wanted this
for a really long time.

3
00:01:18,295 --> 00:01:19,013
I know.

4
00:01:21,435 --> 00:01:22,359
Wizard.

5
00:01:29,687 --> 00:01:32,199
Jeez Banana,
shut your freakin' gob OK?

6
00:01:35,354 --> 00:01:39,804
This is the most magnificent discarded
living room set I've ever seen.

7
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,959
Well, well, if it isn't
MacGuff the Crime Dog.

8
00:04:13,522 --> 00:04:14,349
Back for another test?

9
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:17,676
I think the first one was defective,

10
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,068
The plus sign looks more like a
division symbol, so I remain unconvinced.

11
00:04:23,396 --> 00:04:27,444
Third test today, Momma Bear, your
eggo's preggo, no doubt about it.

12
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,407
It's really easy to tell,
is your nipples real brown?

13
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:34,812
Yeah, maybe your little boyfriend's
got mutant sperms, knocked you up twice.

14
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:40,187
Silencio, old man. Look, I just drank my
weight in SunnyD and I gotta go pronto.

15
00:04:41,686 --> 00:04:42,811
Well, you know where the lavatory is.

16
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:46,595
Pay for that pee stick when you're done.

17
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:50,233
Don't think it's yours just 'cause
you marked it with your urine.

18
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:22,850
What's the prognosis,
Fertile Myrtle: Minus or plus?

19
00:05:23,597 --> 00:05:25,021
I don't know, it's not seasoned yet.

20
00:05:26,755 --> 00:05:27,535
I'll take some of these.

21
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:34,285
There it is.

22
00:05:35,692 --> 00:05:38,083
The little pink plus sign is so unholy.

23
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:43,878
That ain't no Etch-a-Sketch, this is one
doodle that can't be undid, homeskillet.

24
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,125
Yo-yo-yiggity-yo.

25
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:09,722
I'm a suicide risk.

26
00:07:10,502 --> 00:07:11,018
Juno?

27
00:07:11,409 --> 00:07:13,852
No, it's Morgan Freeman, do you
have any bones that need collecting?

28
00:07:14,603 --> 00:07:17,164
Only the one in my pants.

29
00:07:18,869 --> 00:07:19,760
I'm pregnant.

30
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,774
What? Honest to blog?

31
00:07:22,196 --> 00:07:23,789
Yeah, it's Bleeker's.

32
00:07:24,336 --> 00:07:27,413
It's probably just a food
baby, did you have a big lunch?

33
00:07:27,928 --> 00:07:33,164
This is not a food baby, I've taken three
pregnancy tests and I am fo' shiz up the spout.

34
00:07:35,257 --> 00:07:39,073
How did you even generate enough pee for
three pregnancy tests? That's amazing.

35
00:07:40,492 --> 00:07:42,930
I don't know, I drank
like ten tons of SunnyD.

36
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:47,492
I'm telling you I'm pregnant and
you're acting shockingly cavalier.

37
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:49,974
Is this for real?
Like for real for real?

38
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:52,054
Unfortunately yes.

39
00:07:54,492 --> 00:07:55,678
Oh, my God!

40
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,723
Oh shit! Phuket Thailand!

41
00:07:59,364 --> 00:08:02,741
That was kind of the emotion that I
was searching for on the first take.

42
00:08:03,084 --> 00:08:05,296
Are you going to
Havenbrook or Women Now?

43
00:08:05,297 --> 00:08:07,929
You need a note from your
parents for Havenbrook.

44
00:08:08,369 --> 00:08:12,865
Yeah, I know. No, I'm going to go to Women
Now, just 'cause they help out women now.

45
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:15,570
Do you want me to call for you?
Because I called for Becky last year.

46
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:16,908
No, I can call myself.

47
00:08:16,909 --> 00:08:19,771
Oh, but I do need your help with
something, it's like critically important.

48
00:08:22,085 --> 00:08:23,772
You know, heavy lifting can
really only help you at this point.

49
00:08:25,724 --> 00:08:26,459
Seriously.

50
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:30,069
So, you were bored? That's how
this blessed miracle came to be?

51
00:08:30,366 --> 00:08:34,666
No, the act was premeditated. I mean, the
sex, not the whole "let's get pregnant" thing.

52
00:08:35,702 --> 00:08:40,110
So, when did you decide that
you were gonna do Bleeker?

53
00:08:41,549 --> 00:08:42,190
I don't know.

54
00:08:45,485 --> 00:08:46,516
A year ago in Spanish class.

55
00:08:49,033 --> 00:08:49,799
You love him.

56
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:55,734
It's actually really complicated, OK?

57
00:08:56,359 --> 00:09:00,033
And I don't feel like talking
about it in my fragile state.

58
00:09:01,532 --> 00:09:02,329
So what was it like?

59
00:09:03,206 --> 00:09:04,501
Humping Bleek's bony bod?

60
00:09:05,798 --> 00:09:06,829
Magnificent.

61
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:45,965
Hey, Bleek.

62
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,339
Wicked tiger.

63
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:51,182
It looks proud.

64
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:53,963
I swiped it from Ms. Rancick's lawn.

65
00:09:56,075 --> 00:09:58,714
Wow, your shorts are like
especially gold today.

66
00:09:59,354 --> 00:10:00,853
My mom uses color-safe bleach.

67
00:10:01,715 --> 00:10:02,542
Go Carole.

68
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:04,869
I'll tell her.

69
00:10:09,384 --> 00:10:12,636
When I see them all running like that, with
their things bouncing around in their shorts,

70
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:17,196
I always picture them naked, even if I
don't want to, all I see is pork swords.

71
00:10:19,292 --> 00:10:20,057
I'm supposed to be running.

72
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:22,384
So guess what.

73
00:10:24,245 --> 00:10:24,947
What? I don't know.

74
00:10:27,244 --> 00:10:28,010
I'm pregnant.

75
00:10:39,977 --> 00:10:40,807
What should we do?

76
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:49,585
Oh, you know, I was thinking I'd just
nip it in the bud before it gets worse.

77
00:10:50,493 --> 00:10:52,696
Because they were talking
about it in health class,

78
00:10:53,867 --> 00:10:55,929
how pregnancy can
often lead to an infant.

79
00:10:56,804 --> 00:10:57,556
Typically, yeah, yeah.

80
00:10:58,431 --> 00:11:01,321
That's what happens when our
moms and teachers get pregnant.

81
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:06,352
So, you're cool with that then?

82
00:11:07,586 --> 00:11:10,023
Yeah, yeah, wizard. You know,

83
00:11:11,053 --> 00:11:12,944
do whatever you think
you should do, you know?

84
00:11:18,538 --> 00:11:19,725
Well, I'm sorry I had sex with you,

85
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:22,571
I know it wasn't your idea.

86
00:11:24,398 --> 00:11:25,866
Whose idea was it?

87
00:11:26,397 --> 00:11:27,803
I'll see you at school, alright?

88
00:11:32,115 --> 00:11:33,022
Whose idea was it?

89
00:12:00,591 --> 00:12:01,451
Hey, your book fell apart.

90
00:12:02,589 --> 00:12:03,295
Right.

91
00:12:03,886 --> 00:12:04,936
It must have looked at your face.

92
00:12:08,184 --> 00:12:10,858
The funny thing is that Steve
Rendazo secretly wants me.

93
00:12:11,495 --> 00:12:13,451
Jocks like him always want freaky girls.

94
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:18,245
Girls with horn-rimmed glasses
and vegan footwear and Goth makeup.

95
00:12:19,388 --> 00:12:22,106
Girls who play the cello
and read McSweeney's and

96
00:12:22,107 --> 00:12:24,933
want to be children's
librarians when they grow up.

97
00:12:25,652 --> 00:12:27,950
Oh yeah, jocks totally eat that shit up.

98
00:12:28,668 --> 00:12:29,952
They just won't admit
it, because they're

99
00:12:29,953 --> 00:12:31,511
supposed to be into perfect
cheerleaders you know,

100
00:12:32,233 --> 00:12:35,343
Like Leah, who incidentally
is into teachers.

101
00:12:36,202 --> 00:12:37,859
Me too, I love Woody Allen!

102
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:43,686
Alright people.

103
00:12:44,108 --> 00:12:46,303
We're doing chromatography
lab today, so find

104
00:12:46,304 --> 00:12:48,450
your partners and break
into groups of four.

105
00:12:54,672 --> 00:12:56,122
Well, there's nothing
like experimenting.

106
00:12:58,264 --> 00:13:00,262
I did the prep questions
for this lab last night,

107
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:02,060
so you can just copy
my answers if you want.

108
00:13:02,419 --> 00:13:03,324
I couldn't copy your work.

109
00:13:04,075 --> 00:13:05,295
You copy my work every week.

110
00:13:05,812 --> 00:13:07,795
True, I'm kind of a deadbeat
lab partner, aren't I?

111
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,077
No, no, I don't mind. I think you
definitely bring something to the table.

112
00:13:10,574 --> 00:13:11,293
Charisma.

113
00:13:13,686 --> 00:13:15,825
Who's ready for some chromamagnificence?

114
00:13:16,450 --> 00:13:19,248
I have a menstrual migraine, so I can't
really look at bright lights today.

115
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:23,169
Amanda, I told you to go to the
infirmary and lie down. You never listen.

116
00:13:23,699 --> 00:13:27,311
No, Josh, because I don't take orders.
Not from you and not from any man.

117
00:13:27,776 --> 00:13:29,236
You know, you've been
acting like this ever since

118
00:13:29,237 --> 00:13:30,637
I got back from visiting
my brother in Mankato.

119
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:32,731
I already told you, nothing happened.

120
00:13:33,074 --> 00:13:34,670
Well, I'm gonna set up the apparatus.

121
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,435
Juno, do you want to
plug in the Bunsen burner?

122
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:38,856
It's my pleasure.

123
00:13:39,246 --> 00:13:39,887
I'm going to the infirmary.

124
00:13:40,276 --> 00:13:41,198
Good. Call me when you get off the rag.

125
00:13:41,464 --> 00:13:43,124
Fine, call me when you
learn how to love someone,

126
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,684
instead of cheating at
your brother's college,

127
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,852
Just because you've had
four Smirnoff Ices and

128
00:13:46,853 --> 00:13:48,715
a bottle of Snow Peak
Peach flavored Boone's!

129
00:13:48,948 --> 00:13:51,435
Good, Amanda, I'll be sure to
do that, I'll make a note of it.

130
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:58,900
I've actually heard that the Snow Peak
Peach flavor is the best flavor of Boone's.

131
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:02,316
Isn't that right, Bleek?

132
00:14:16,886 --> 00:14:19,011
Oprimo numero dos.

133
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:28,228
Yeah, I'm just calling to
procure a hasty abortion.

134
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:30,090
What?

135
00:14:32,073 --> 00:14:34,275
Can you just hold on for a
second, I'm on my hamburger phone.

136
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:40,744
Okay, now I can,

137
00:14:41,556 --> 00:14:43,311
Yeah, it's really awkward to talk on.

138
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:47,775
Yeah, I need an abortion.

139
00:14:49,307 --> 00:14:50,276
Sixteen.

140
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:56,324
I'm gonna say it's been about two
months and four days since the sex,

141
00:14:57,071 --> 00:14:59,055
Mind you, that's just
like a guestimation.

142
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,759
Sorry, how long have I been what?

143
00:15:04,524 --> 00:15:07,242
Oh, I hate it when adults use
the term "sexually active".

144
00:15:07,977 --> 00:15:09,057
What does it even mean?

145
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:12,571
Can I deactivate someday, or is
this a permanent state of being?

146
00:15:13,133 --> 00:15:14,834
I guess Bleeker went
live that night we did it,

147
00:15:14,835 --> 00:15:16,571
I guess that's why he
got that look on his face.

148
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:21,146
You should have seen this
octopus furnace at work.

149
00:15:21,147 --> 00:15:24,524
I had to get out my Hazmat
suit just to get into the thing.

150
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:27,196
My dad used to be in the Army, but now
he's just your average HVAC specialist.

151
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:31,088
He and my mom got
divorced when I was five,

152
00:15:31,446 --> 00:15:33,158
She lives on a Havasu
reservation in Arizona

153
00:15:33,159 --> 00:15:35,023
with her new husband and
three replacement kids.

154
00:15:35,539 --> 00:15:38,619
Oh, and she inexplicably mails
me a cactus every Valentine's Day.

155
00:15:38,963 --> 00:15:40,957
And I'm like, Thanks
a heap, Coyote Ugly.

156
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:43,757
This cactus-gram stings even
worse than your abandonment.

157
00:15:45,244 --> 00:15:48,680
That's my stepmom, Bren, she's
completely obsessed with dogs.

158
00:15:49,477 --> 00:15:52,756
Owns a nail salon and always
smells like methylmethacrylate.

159
00:15:53,631 --> 00:15:55,836
So Juno, how was your
little maneuver last night?

160
00:15:56,883 --> 00:16:00,243
Which maneuver, sir? The one where I moved an
entire living room set from one lawn to the other,

161
00:16:01,021 --> 00:16:04,479
or the one where I downed a sixty-four
ounce blue slushie in ten minutes?

162
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,678
Juno, did you by any
chance barf in my urn?

163
00:16:11,367 --> 00:16:13,882
Mac, you know that nice urn by the front
door, the one I got up in Stillwater?

164
00:16:14,821 --> 00:16:15,989
There was some blue shit,

165
00:16:16,412 --> 00:16:18,647
I mean, gunk, stuff
in there this morning.

166
00:16:21,584 --> 00:16:23,193
I would never barf in your urn, Brenda.

167
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:26,476
I mean, maybe L.B. did it.

168
00:16:28,835 --> 00:16:32,644
Liberty Bell, if you put one more Baco on that
potato, I'm gonna kick your little monkey butt.

169
00:16:35,896 --> 00:16:40,007
All babies want to get borned!
All babies want to get borned!

170
00:16:40,988 --> 00:16:43,693
All babies want to get borned!

171
00:16:45,599 --> 00:16:46,583
Hey Su-Chin.

172
00:16:47,458 --> 00:16:48,488
Hi, Juno.

173
00:16:49,225 --> 00:16:50,068
How are you?

174
00:16:50,348 --> 00:16:51,653
You know, pretty solid.

175
00:16:53,996 --> 00:16:56,678
So did you write that
paper for Worth's class yet?

176
00:16:57,572 --> 00:16:58,446
No, not yet.

177
00:16:59,508 --> 00:17:02,725
I tried to work on it a little last night,
but I'm having trouble concentrating.

178
00:17:03,275 --> 00:17:04,803
I'll sell you some of my Adderall.

179
00:17:05,836 --> 00:17:07,212
No thanks, I'm off pills.

180
00:17:07,601 --> 00:17:10,805
That's a wise choice 'cause I knew
this girl, she had this crazy freakout.

181
00:17:11,727 --> 00:17:15,788
She took too many behavioral meds at
once and she ripped off her clothes

182
00:17:16,227 --> 00:17:22,164
and dove into the fountain at Ridgedale Mall
like, Blaaaaah! I'm a kraken from the sea!

183
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:26,068
I heard that was you.

184
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:29,757
It was good seeing you, Su-Chin.

185
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,348
Your baby probably has a
beating heart, you know?

186
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,508
It can feel pain,

187
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,100
And it has fingernails.

188
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,397
Fingernails? Really?

189
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:04,068
Welcome to Women Now, where
women are trusted friends.

190
00:18:04,505 --> 00:18:07,113
Please put your hands where I can
see them and surrender any bombs.

191
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:09,943
Hey, I'm here for the big show.

192
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,067
Your name, please?

193
00:18:13,472 --> 00:18:14,347
Juno MacGuff.

194
00:18:15,662 --> 00:18:18,739
She thinks I'm using a fake name.
Like Gene Simmons or Mother Teresa.

195
00:18:22,084 --> 00:18:24,490
I need you to fill
these out, both sides.

196
00:18:24,491 --> 00:18:27,411
We need to know about
every score and every sore.

197
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:31,771
Would you like a free condom?

198
00:18:32,598 --> 00:18:33,442
They're boysenberry.

199
00:18:34,238 --> 00:18:35,597
No, I'm off sex.

200
00:18:37,565 --> 00:18:40,051
My boyfriend uses them every
time we have intercourse.

201
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,585
They make his jocks smell like pie.

202
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:21,115
All babies want to get borned!
All babies want to get borned!

203
00:19:22,849 --> 00:19:24,428
God appreciates your miracle!

204
00:19:26,037 --> 00:19:27,740
Dude, what are you doing here?

205
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:29,349
I'm supposed to come get you at four.

206
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:30,569
I couldn't do it, Leah!

207
00:19:31,991 --> 00:19:33,972
It smelled like a
dentist office in there,

208
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:36,085
And there were these horrible
magazines with water stains.

209
00:19:36,552 --> 00:19:38,751
And then the friggin'
receptionist is trying to

210
00:19:38,752 --> 00:19:41,225
give me these condoms that
looked like grape suckers,

211
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:45,101
and just babbling away about her
friggin' boyfriend's pie balls.

212
00:19:45,488 --> 00:19:46,179
Yum!

213
00:19:46,491 --> 00:19:48,385
And Su-Chin was there, and she was

214
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:50,724
like, "Oh hi! Babies have fingernails. "

215
00:19:51,114 --> 00:19:51,929
Fingernails!

216
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,179
That's gruesome.

217
00:19:53,772 --> 00:19:55,849
You think the baby can scratch
your vag on the way out?

218
00:19:57,442 --> 00:19:58,786
I'm staying pregnant, Leah.

219
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:02,233
Dude! You gotta keep your
voice down, my mom is inside.

220
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,552
She doesn't know that
we're sexually active.

221
00:20:04,973 --> 00:20:06,020
What does that even mean?

222
00:20:07,053 --> 00:20:08,724
I've been thinking.

223
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:12,582
I was thinking that I could have this baby
and give it to someone who totally needs it.

224
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:15,378
You know, like a woman with a bum
ovary or a couple of nice lesbos.

225
00:20:15,862 --> 00:20:18,957
But then you're gonna get huge
and your chest is gonna milktate.

226
00:20:19,972 --> 00:20:25,189
- And you have to tell people that you're pregnant.
- But maybe they'll canonize me for being so selfless.

227
00:20:25,442 --> 00:20:31,302
Maybe they'll totally shit and be really mad and
not let you graduate or go to Cabo for spring break.

228
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:33,254
I was going to go to
Gettysburg with Bleeker anyway.

229
00:20:36,472 --> 00:20:38,065
You should look at adoption ads,

230
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:39,861
I see them all the
time in the Penny Saver.

231
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:42,535
They have ads for parents?

232
00:20:43,253 --> 00:20:48,785
Yeah! "Desperately Seeking Spawn. " Right next to
terriers and iguanas and used fitness equipment.

233
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:51,487
It's totally legit.

234
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:59,487
"Wholesome, spiritually wealthy couple
have found true love with each other. "

235
00:21:01,127 --> 00:21:02,470
"All that's missing is your bastard. "

236
00:21:03,391 --> 00:21:04,379
I want a parakeet.

237
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,440
You're totally not even listening to me.

238
00:21:06,814 --> 00:21:11,704
No, I heard you. I don't want to give the baby to
a family that describes themselves as "wholesome. "

239
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,221
- Why?
- I want something a little more edgier.

240
00:21:14,596 --> 00:21:19,081
- Okay, what did you have in mind exactly?
- I was thinking a graphic designer,

241
00:21:19,472 --> 00:21:24,098
mid-thirties, with a cool Asian girlfriend who
dresses awesome and rocks out on the bass guitar.

242
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,175
But I don't want to be too particular.

243
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,516
OK, how about this?

244
00:21:29,813 --> 00:21:33,846
"Educated, successful couple seeking
infant to join our family of five. "

245
00:21:34,205 --> 00:21:38,329
"You will be compensated. Help
us complete the circle of love. "

246
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:40,078
That sounds great.

247
00:21:40,344 --> 00:21:45,141
They sound like a friggin' cult. Besides, they
already have three kids, they're greedy little bitches.

248
00:21:45,735 --> 00:21:47,312
Oh, Juno! How about this one?

249
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:52,907
They were Mark and Vanessa Loring,

250
00:21:54,188 --> 00:21:56,219
And they were beautiful
even in black and white.

251
00:22:06,969 --> 00:22:08,453
Paul? Are you coming downstairs to eat?

252
00:22:08,906 --> 00:22:10,000
No, I don't think so.

253
00:22:10,749 --> 00:22:12,249
You ran eight miles today, Puppy.

254
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,844
I'm not hungry, oddly.

255
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:17,187
But it's breakfast for supper.
It's your favorite, Paul.

256
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:19,264
Yeah.

257
00:22:20,748 --> 00:22:22,548
Juno MacGuff called while
you were out running today.

258
00:22:24,297 --> 00:22:25,577
You know how I feel about her.

259
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:28,688
You've mentioned it a couple times.

260
00:22:30,359 --> 00:22:31,281
She is just...

261
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,218
...different.

262
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:35,499
Yeah.

263
00:23:02,205 --> 00:23:04,236
I'm not really sure how
I'm gonna spit this out.

264
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:05,938
Hon, did you get expelled?

265
00:23:06,437 --> 00:23:10,299
No. The school would most likely
contact you in the event of my expulsion.

266
00:23:10,908 --> 00:23:12,860
Well, I was just asking.
It seemed plausible.

267
00:23:13,515 --> 00:23:15,812
Do you need a large amount
of money? Legal counsel?

268
00:23:16,362 --> 00:23:18,157
No, I'm not asking for anything.

269
00:23:19,283 --> 00:23:22,830
Except for maybe mercy. Like, it would
be friggin' sweet if no one hit me.

270
00:23:23,252 --> 00:23:25,219
What have you done, Junebug?
Did you hit someone with the Previa?

271
00:23:25,672 --> 00:23:26,363
No.

272
00:23:27,007 --> 00:23:29,452
Dude, I think it's
best to just tell them.

273
00:23:37,187 --> 00:23:38,045
I'm pregnant.

274
00:23:38,685 --> 00:23:39,436
Oh, God.

275
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:42,025
But I'm going to give
it up for adoption.

276
00:23:42,026 --> 00:23:43,546
I already found the perfect couple.

277
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:46,092
They're gonna pay for the
medical expenses and everything.

278
00:23:47,576 --> 00:23:51,342
In thirty-odd weeks we can just
pretend that this never happened.

279
00:23:53,811 --> 00:23:54,701
You're pregnant?

280
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,076
I'm sorry.

281
00:23:56,606 --> 00:24:00,029
I'm sorry. And if it is any consolation,

282
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,043
I have heartburn that's
radiating down to my kneecaps

283
00:24:02,779 --> 00:24:05,708
and I haven't take a
dump since Wednesday.

284
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:07,817
Morning!

285
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,553
I didn't even know you
were sexually active!

286
00:24:11,112 --> 00:24:11,927
Who is the kid?

287
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:16,379
The baby? I don't really know much
about it. It has fingernails, allegedly.

288
00:24:17,441 --> 00:24:18,283
Nails? Really?

289
00:24:18,724 --> 00:24:19,362
Yeah.

290
00:24:19,752 --> 00:24:21,567
I mean, who is the father, Juno?

291
00:24:25,409 --> 00:24:26,957
It's Paulie Bleeker.

292
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:29,145
Paulie Bleeker?

293
00:24:31,082 --> 00:24:31,722
What?

294
00:24:32,784 --> 00:24:34,002
I didn't think he had it in him!

295
00:24:34,408 --> 00:24:35,380
I know, right?

296
00:24:36,707 --> 00:24:38,144
Right, this is no laughing matter.

297
00:24:38,534 --> 00:24:39,519
No, it's not.

298
00:24:40,127 --> 00:24:42,220
And Paulie is actually great.

299
00:24:43,463 --> 00:24:44,023
In chair.

300
00:24:46,081 --> 00:24:47,221
You were thinking about adoption?

301
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:49,945
Yeah, there's this couple.

302
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:54,176
They've been trying to
have a kid for five years.

303
00:24:54,497 --> 00:24:56,580
We found them in the Penny
Saver next to the exotic birds.

304
00:24:57,517 --> 00:25:01,565
They have a legitimate lawyer and I was
going to go meet with them next weekend.

305
00:25:02,111 --> 00:25:04,576
Junebug, that is a
tough, tough thing to do.

306
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:07,425
Probably tougher than you
can understand right now.

307
00:25:08,316 --> 00:25:10,002
I know...

308
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,066
...It's just that I'm
not ready to be a mom.

309
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:15,722
Damn skippy, you're not!

310
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,579
You don't even remember to give
Liberty Bell her breathing meds.

311
00:25:19,079 --> 00:25:22,252
That was once! And she
did not die, if you recall!

312
00:25:23,736 --> 00:25:27,172
Honey, had you considered,
you know, the alternative?

313
00:25:28,109 --> 00:25:29,000
No.

314
00:25:29,565 --> 00:25:31,346
Well, you're a little Viking!

315
00:25:33,767 --> 00:25:34,438
First things first,

316
00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:36,297
we have to get you healthy.

317
00:25:36,563 --> 00:25:37,484
You need prenatal vitamins,

318
00:25:38,235 --> 00:25:41,703
Incidentally, they do incredible
things for your nails, so that's a plus.

319
00:25:42,219 --> 00:25:44,095
Oh, and we need to schedule
a doctor's appointment.

320
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:45,611
Figure out where
you're going to deliver.

321
00:25:46,048 --> 00:25:48,813
Juno, I'm coming with you
to meet this adoption people.

322
00:25:50,077 --> 00:25:53,252
You're just a kid. I don't want you to get
ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts.

323
00:25:54,282 --> 00:25:55,156
Thanks, Dad.

324
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,374
I thought you were the kind of
girl who knew when to say when.

325
00:26:05,374 --> 00:26:07,015
I don't really know
what kind of girl I am.

326
00:26:20,937 --> 00:26:23,186
Tell it to me straight, Bren.
Do you think this is my fault?

327
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:25,968
I think kids get bored
and have intercourse.

328
00:26:26,827 --> 00:26:29,389
And I think Junebug was
a dummy about it, Mac.

329
00:26:29,717 --> 00:26:30,892
I am not ready to be a Pop-Pop.

330
00:26:31,451 --> 00:26:32,437
You're not going to be a Pop-Pop.

331
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:38,060
Somebody else is going to find a precious blessing
from Jesus in this garbage dump of a situation.

332
00:26:39,609 --> 00:26:41,671
Did you see that coming
when she sat us down here?

333
00:26:41,968 --> 00:26:44,545
Yeah. But I was hoping she was
expelled or into hard drugs.

334
00:26:44,997 --> 00:26:48,577
That was my first instinct too.
Or D.W.I. Anything but this.

335
00:26:50,873 --> 00:26:53,310
And I'm going to punch that Bleeker kid
in the weiner the next time I see him.

336
00:26:53,763 --> 00:26:56,607
Mac, no. You know it wasn't his idea.

337
00:28:04,392 --> 00:28:07,625
Hi! I'm Vanessa. You must
be Juno and Mr. MacGuff.

338
00:28:08,534 --> 00:28:09,455
Vanessa.

339
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:10,908
It's Vanessa, right?

340
00:28:11,954 --> 00:28:14,827
Thanks for having me and my
irresponsible child over to your house.

341
00:28:15,452 --> 00:28:16,346
Oh no. Thank you.

342
00:28:17,986 --> 00:28:19,017
Come on in.

343
00:28:19,423 --> 00:28:21,644
Can I take your coat or your hat?

344
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,096
Oh, yeah, sure, thanks.

345
00:28:23,861 --> 00:28:26,572
Wicked pic in the Penny Saver,
by the way. Super classy.

346
00:28:26,573 --> 00:28:29,284
Not like those people with
fake woods in the background,

347
00:28:29,532 --> 00:28:31,517
Honestly, who do they
think they're fooling?

348
00:28:32,361 --> 00:28:33,439
You found us in the Penny Saver?

349
00:28:33,782 --> 00:28:35,688
Hi. Mark Loring. I'm the husband.

350
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,171
- How you doing? Mac McGuff.
- Nice to meet you.

351
00:28:39,361 --> 00:28:40,048
Hi.

352
00:28:40,283 --> 00:28:42,172
This is Gerta Rauss, our attorney.

353
00:28:42,532 --> 00:28:44,437
Gerta Rauss.

354
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,626
Hi, pleased to meet you.

355
00:28:48,375 --> 00:28:49,844
And this, of course, is Juno.

356
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:52,361
Like the city in Alaska.

357
00:28:52,827 --> 00:28:53,408
No.

358
00:28:54,157 --> 00:28:54,782
No?

359
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:56,063
Hon?

360
00:28:56,610 --> 00:28:57,999
Shall we sit down and
get to know one another?

361
00:28:58,249 --> 00:28:59,499
I thought I'd get some drinks.

362
00:28:59,812 --> 00:29:03,907
What would anyone like? I have Pellegrino
or Vitamin Water or orange juice.

363
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,374
A Maker's Mark, please. Up.

364
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:09,248
She's kidding.

365
00:29:09,982 --> 00:29:13,405
Junebug has a wonderful sense of humor,
just one of her many genetic gifts.

366
00:29:13,670 --> 00:29:14,498
I see.

367
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:21,030
So, Juno. First off,
how far along are you?

368
00:29:21,592 --> 00:29:22,326
I'm a junior.

369
00:29:23,622 --> 00:29:25,374
No, I mean in your pregnancy.

370
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:32,169
Oh. Uh, actually my stepmom took me yesterday
to the doctor and they said I was twelve weeks.

371
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:33,562
Oh, that's marvelous.

372
00:29:33,781 --> 00:29:35,670
So you're into your second trimester?

373
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:39,544
Yeah, apparently.

374
00:29:40,296 --> 00:29:41,640
I'm due on May 4.

375
00:29:41,936 --> 00:29:42,639
Great.

376
00:29:42,873 --> 00:29:45,188
My girlfriends tell me the first
couple months are the hardest.

377
00:29:45,732 --> 00:29:47,012
I didn't notice it at all.

378
00:29:47,281 --> 00:29:53,591
I'm more concerned about when they have to
put that elastic band in the front of my jeans.

379
00:29:54,668 --> 00:29:56,061
I think pregnancy is beautiful.

380
00:29:56,873 --> 00:29:58,355
Well, you're lucky it's not you.

381
00:30:01,981 --> 00:30:04,636
So, let's talk how we're
gonna do this... thing.

382
00:30:05,139 --> 00:30:07,169
Well, don't I just have the thing?

383
00:30:07,479 --> 00:30:09,356
Squeeze it on out and hand it over?

384
00:30:10,403 --> 00:30:13,450
Mark and Vanessa are willing
to negotiate an open adoption.

385
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:14,935
What does that mean?

386
00:30:15,404 --> 00:30:18,009
It means they'd send
annual updates, photos,

387
00:30:18,010 --> 00:30:21,482
let Juno know how the baby is
doing as he or she grows up.

388
00:30:21,747 --> 00:30:25,873
Whoah. I don't want photos
or any kind of notification.

389
00:30:27,294 --> 00:30:29,316
Can't we just kick this old school?

390
00:30:29,317 --> 00:30:32,301
I stick the baby in a
basket and send it your way.

391
00:30:32,302 --> 00:30:33,823
Like Moses in the reeds.

392
00:30:34,854 --> 00:30:36,637
Technically, that would be
kickin' it Old Testament.

393
00:30:38,199 --> 00:30:39,652
Exactly! Right?

394
00:30:40,058 --> 00:30:40,839
Do you know what I mean?

395
00:30:41,213 --> 00:30:43,231
Like in the good old days.
When it was quick and dirty.

396
00:30:45,074 --> 00:30:50,231
Well, then we all agree a traditional closed
adoption would be best for all involved?

397
00:30:50,871 --> 00:30:53,589
Shit, yes, just close her on up.

398
00:30:54,339 --> 00:30:56,791
Obviously, we would compensate
you for all your medical expenses.

399
00:30:57,794 --> 00:30:59,948
Are you looking for any
other type of compensation?

400
00:31:02,167 --> 00:31:02,964
Excuse me?

401
00:31:06,778 --> 00:31:07,511
No.

402
00:31:07,886 --> 00:31:10,166
No, I don't want to
sell the thing, I just...

403
00:31:11,307 --> 00:31:12,181
...I want...

404
00:31:14,403 --> 00:31:18,135
...I just want the baby to be
with people who are gonna love it,

405
00:31:19,103 --> 00:31:20,884
And be good parents, you know?

406
00:31:22,777 --> 00:31:24,385
I'm in high school.

407
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:27,946
I'm ill-equipped.

408
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:33,260
You're doing a beautiful
and a selfless thing for us.

409
00:31:33,759 --> 00:31:35,946
Vanessa has wanted a baby
ever since we got married.

410
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,510
I want to be a mommy so badly!

411
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:39,884
You don't say.

412
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,556
Have you ever felt like you
were just born to do something?

413
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:44,195
Yes.

414
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:45,619
Heating and air conditioning.

415
00:31:46,228 --> 00:31:47,165
There you go.

416
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:49,337
I was born to be a mother.

417
00:31:49,946 --> 00:31:50,883
Some of us are.

418
00:31:51,664 --> 00:31:55,478
How about you, Mark, are you
looking forward to being a dad?

419
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:57,524
Betcha, yeah.

420
00:31:58,867 --> 00:32:02,384
Every guy wants to be a father.
Wants to coach the soccer team and

421
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:06,366
help out with the science
fair and the volcano goes off.

422
00:32:07,588 --> 00:32:08,619
Yeah, all that.

423
00:32:10,025 --> 00:32:13,930
Maybe Gerta could take us through the
preliminary documents that you have drawn up.

424
00:32:14,491 --> 00:32:20,570
Could I use the facilities first? Being
pregnant makes me pee like Seabiscuit.

425
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:26,741
The downstairs bathroom is being re-tiled,
but if you go upstairs, then to the right...

426
00:32:26,977 --> 00:32:28,429
Oh yeah! Room with the toilet.

427
00:32:30,025 --> 00:32:30,740
Is she alright?

428
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:19,411
Sorry.

429
00:33:19,910 --> 00:33:20,909
Sorry, I didn't expect
to see you up here.

430
00:33:21,365 --> 00:33:22,332
I just came up to get something.

431
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:24,958
Did your wife send you
up here to spy on me?

432
00:33:25,598 --> 00:33:26,332
No.

433
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:29,004
Do we come off as paranoid
yuppies or something?

434
00:33:32,521 --> 00:33:34,113
I stole a squirt of your wife's perfume.

435
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:35,318
Really?

436
00:33:35,956 --> 00:33:37,256
It's Clinique Happy.

437
00:33:37,644 --> 00:33:39,474
Get a whiff of those sparkling topnotes!

438
00:33:40,067 --> 00:33:42,473
Is that supposed to make me feel happy?

439
00:33:43,269 --> 00:33:44,331
You should feel happy, Holmes.

440
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:49,128
I'm giving you and Vanessa the gift of life.
Sweet, screaming, pooping life!

441
00:33:49,472 --> 00:33:51,506
And you don't even have to be there
when it comes out all covered in...

442
00:33:51,939 --> 00:33:52,783
Viscera?

443
00:33:53,067 --> 00:33:54,114
Blood and guts.

444
00:33:58,564 --> 00:33:59,644
Is that a Les Paul?

445
00:34:01,157 --> 00:34:02,098
Yes, it is.

446
00:34:02,551 --> 00:34:04,316
Vanessa gave me my own
room for all my stuff.

447
00:34:05,706 --> 00:34:09,535
She gave you your own room in
your whole house for your stuff?

448
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:12,580
She's got you on a
long leash there, Mark.

449
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:15,127
Oh, it's beautiful.

450
00:34:15,892 --> 00:34:18,363
You know? I always loved
Gibson way more than Fender.

451
00:34:19,644 --> 00:34:20,690
What do you play?

452
00:34:21,143 --> 00:34:22,501
I rock a Harmony.

453
00:34:26,877 --> 00:34:27,706
So is it mahagony?

454
00:34:27,956 --> 00:34:31,160
What happens if you crack the neck?

455
00:34:31,441 --> 00:34:32,922
Tell me about it. I used
to play in this really tight

456
00:34:32,923 --> 00:34:34,457
band when I lived in Chicago
and one night we opened up

457
00:34:34,941 --> 00:34:36,818
for the Melvins and I
busted that thing right on

458
00:34:36,819 --> 00:34:38,657
stage and it cost me
$800 just to get it fixed.

459
00:34:40,625 --> 00:34:42,034
When was that?

460
00:34:42,411 --> 00:34:44,048
бо93. Best time for rock and roll.

461
00:34:45,692 --> 00:34:49,971
Nuh-uh, '77! Punk Volume #1.

462
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,407
You're crazy.

463
00:34:51,813 --> 00:34:52,735
You weren't there,

464
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:54,406
You couldn't understand the magic.

465
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:55,846
You weren't even alive!

466
00:34:58,299 --> 00:34:58,985
What's that?

467
00:35:02,531 --> 00:35:03,580
It's a Pilates machine.

468
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,125
What do you make with it?

469
00:35:08,500 --> 00:35:10,799
You don't make anything.
It's for exercising.

470
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,220
My wife ordered one of those

471
00:35:15,175 --> 00:35:16,969
Tony Little Gazelles off the TV.

472
00:35:17,608 --> 00:35:18,924
You know, from the
guy with the ponytail?

473
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,532
That guy just doesn't look right to me.

474
00:35:30,687 --> 00:35:31,908
I'll be right back.

475
00:35:34,563 --> 00:35:35,392
Excuse me.

476
00:35:44,639 --> 00:35:45,280
Hi.

477
00:35:46,155 --> 00:35:46,669
Hi.

478
00:35:47,124 --> 00:35:48,076
You're playing music?

479
00:35:48,637 --> 00:35:50,387
Juno wanted a little
closer look at Kimber.

480
00:35:51,465 --> 00:35:52,621
Your guitar is named Kimber?

481
00:35:53,155 --> 00:35:53,624
Yeah.

482
00:35:53,935 --> 00:35:55,995
That's cool. My axe is named Roosevelt.

483
00:35:55,996 --> 00:35:59,059
After Franklin, not Ted. He
was the hot one with polio.

484
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,732
Gerta is downstairs, we still have

485
00:36:04,450 --> 00:36:05,684
a lot of stuff to go over.

486
00:36:07,277 --> 00:36:08,202
I got it.

487
00:36:09,310 --> 00:36:10,810
Not to interrupt the jam session.

488
00:36:14,901 --> 00:36:18,215
So, just look these over and if you
have any questions, call me at my office.

489
00:36:18,762 --> 00:36:23,573
We would really appreciate it if you would just
keep us updated on any doctor's appointments,

490
00:36:23,919 --> 00:36:25,606
Ultrasounds, anything of that nature.

491
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,823
For sure. You want to know how
your kid is cooking, I get it.

492
00:36:31,463 --> 00:36:32,543
You think you're really
going to do this, then?

493
00:36:34,152 --> 00:36:36,730
Yeah. I like you guys.

494
00:36:39,028 --> 00:36:40,559
How sure would you say you are?

495
00:36:43,371 --> 00:36:45,884
Would you say you're 80% sure, 90% sure?

496
00:36:48,387 --> 00:36:50,167
I'm going to say I'm about 104% sure.

497
00:36:50,885 --> 00:36:51,791
Really?

498
00:36:52,997 --> 00:36:57,324
Seriously, if I could just have the thing
and give it to you now, I totally would,

499
00:36:57,698 --> 00:37:00,809
But I'm guessing it looks probably
like a Sea Monkey right now,

500
00:37:01,228 --> 00:37:04,464
And we should let it get
a little cuter, right?

501
00:37:04,932 --> 00:37:05,901
- Yeah.
- Great.

502
00:37:06,479 --> 00:37:07,244
Keep it in the oven.

503
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:08,478
I think that's a great idea.

504
00:37:08,915 --> 00:37:09,650
Nice to meet you both.

505
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:12,635
Please, drive carefully.
Hopefully we'll hear from you soon.

506
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:17,003
- Take care.
- Buh bye.

507
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:52,414
Hey, man.

508
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:54,163
Hey, Vijay.

509
00:37:54,399 --> 00:37:55,900
Did you hear Juno MacGuff is pregnant?

510
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:57,369
Yeah.

511
00:37:57,962 --> 00:37:59,946
- Like our moms and teachers!
- Yeah.

512
00:38:00,508 --> 00:38:01,289
Did you hear it's yours?

513
00:38:03,412 --> 00:38:04,150
Yup.

514
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,180
What a trip, man.

515
00:38:06,508 --> 00:38:08,289
I don't really know too much about it.

516
00:38:09,132 --> 00:38:10,412
You should grow a moustache.

517
00:38:11,334 --> 00:38:12,194
I can't.

518
00:38:12,508 --> 00:38:13,336
Me neither.

519
00:38:13,540 --> 00:38:15,101
But I'm going to stop
wearing underpants.

520
00:38:15,508 --> 00:38:17,617
Raise my sperm count.

521
00:38:44,132 --> 00:38:44,929
Juno, hey.

522
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:45,835
Hey, Bleek.

523
00:38:46,037 --> 00:38:48,752
Me and some guys are gonna go to the movies
after school and we're gonna donut that flick

524
00:38:49,229 --> 00:38:51,460
with the guy who has eighteen kids.

525
00:38:51,898 --> 00:38:52,929
Do you want to come?

526
00:38:54,631 --> 00:38:56,286
Sounds awesome, but I got my ultrasound.

527
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:58,161
Oh, really?

528
00:38:59,695 --> 00:39:00,476
Can I...

529
00:39:02,147 --> 00:39:03,131
...Should I come?

530
00:39:05,976 --> 00:39:07,287
Oh, you can't waste those donut balls,

531
00:39:07,709 --> 00:39:11,349
But maybe I could drop by later.

532
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:13,239
Okay, cool.

533
00:39:14,037 --> 00:39:15,131
- Later, Bleek.
- See ya.

534
00:39:17,911 --> 00:39:18,724
I'll save you a seat.

535
00:39:30,569 --> 00:39:31,552
There's your baby.

536
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:33,582
Oh, my God.

537
00:39:36,128 --> 00:39:36,991
There's a hand.

538
00:39:39,802 --> 00:39:40,660
And an arm.

539
00:39:44,209 --> 00:39:45,475
And there's the feet.

540
00:39:49,084 --> 00:39:50,004
Would you look at that?

541
00:39:52,019 --> 00:39:55,160
Check out Baby Big-Head. Dude,
that thing is freaky looking!

542
00:39:56,114 --> 00:39:58,566
Excuse me, I am a sacred vessel.

543
00:39:58,908 --> 00:40:00,818
All you've got in your
stomach is Taco Bell!

544
00:40:02,395 --> 00:40:04,707
It's amazing that there's
actually saps that cry at this.

545
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:07,817
What? I'm not made of stone.

546
00:40:09,394 --> 00:40:10,428
Well, there you have it.

547
00:40:11,676 --> 00:40:12,553
Would you like to know the sex?

548
00:40:13,018 --> 00:40:13,770
- Yes.
- No.

549
00:40:14,083 --> 00:40:15,739
- Please, Junebug?
- No sex.

550
00:40:16,926 --> 00:40:18,394
Planning to be surprised
when you deliver?

551
00:40:18,768 --> 00:40:23,067
I want Mark and Vanessa to be surprised, and
if you told me, I'll just ruin everything.

552
00:40:23,598 --> 00:40:25,379
Are Mark and Vanessa
your friends at school?

553
00:40:25,754 --> 00:40:26,861
No, they're the adoptive parents.

554
00:40:28,442 --> 00:40:29,548
Oh. Well, thank goodness for that.

555
00:40:31,222 --> 00:40:32,066
What's that supposed to mean?

556
00:40:33,487 --> 00:40:35,689
I just see a lot of teenage
mothers come through here.

557
00:40:36,596 --> 00:40:38,940
It's obviously a poisonous
environment to raise a baby in.

558
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:40,972
How do you know that I'm so poisonous?

559
00:40:41,347 --> 00:40:44,566
What if these adoptive parents
turn out to be evil molesters?

560
00:40:44,816 --> 00:40:46,784
Or like stage parents.

561
00:40:47,018 --> 00:40:49,419
They could be utterly negligent.
Maybe they'll do a far shittier job

562
00:40:49,818 --> 00:40:51,661
of raising a kid than my
dumbass stepdaughter ever would.

563
00:40:51,662 --> 00:40:52,519
Have you considered that?

564
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:54,892
No, I guess not.

565
00:40:56,331 --> 00:40:57,611
What is your job title, exactly?

566
00:40:58,642 --> 00:41:01,487
I'm an ultrasound technician, ma'am.

567
00:41:02,081 --> 00:41:05,438
Well I'm a nail technician, and I think
we both ought to stick to what we know.

568
00:41:05,986 --> 00:41:06,751
Excuse me?

569
00:41:07,548 --> 00:41:11,971
You think you're so special because
you get to play Picture Pages up there?

570
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:14,235
My five year-old daughter could do that, and let me tell
you, she is not the brightest bulb in the tanning bed.

571
00:41:14,676 --> 00:41:17,549
So why don't you go back to night
school in Manteno and learn a real trade!

572
00:41:23,564 --> 00:41:24,986
Bren, you's a dick!

573
00:41:26,532 --> 00:41:27,438
I love it.

574
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:32,716
Juno? Wow, I didn't
expect to see you here.

575
00:42:33,234 --> 00:42:36,030
I have something really cool to
show you guys. Is Vanessa here?

576
00:42:37,485 --> 00:42:39,610
No, actually she's working late tonight.

577
00:42:40,453 --> 00:42:42,468
She's trying to accrue as much
time off as she can before...

578
00:42:43,186 --> 00:42:44,592
Oh right. I hear these
are quite the time-suck.

579
00:42:46,109 --> 00:42:48,059
Wanna come in? I was just
having a Ginseng Cooler.

580
00:42:48,544 --> 00:42:49,639
Would you like one?

581
00:42:49,968 --> 00:42:53,015
What is it with you rich people
and your herb-infused juices?

582
00:42:54,637 --> 00:42:56,106
It's probably got something to do with
those forty four-packs they come in.

583
00:42:57,717 --> 00:42:58,920
They're not bad, though.

584
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:01,044
Why aren't you at work?

585
00:43:01,966 --> 00:43:03,655
I work mostly from home. I'm a composer.

586
00:43:05,357 --> 00:43:06,310
No shit.

587
00:43:06,981 --> 00:43:08,247
Like Johannes Brahms?

588
00:43:08,606 --> 00:43:10,419
No, more commercial stuff.

589
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:11,998
Like what?

590
00:43:12,357 --> 00:43:13,482
Commercials.

591
00:43:14,856 --> 00:43:17,075
Have you seen the ads for the
Titanium Power men's deodorant?

592
00:43:28,592 --> 00:43:29,575
Paid for this kitchen.

593
00:43:32,355 --> 00:43:33,357
You're quite the sellout, Mark.

594
00:43:35,325 --> 00:43:36,825
What would the Melvins say?

595
00:43:38,372 --> 00:43:39,683
Did you say you had
something to show me.

596
00:43:40,607 --> 00:43:43,154
Behold, good sir! Your future child.

597
00:43:45,153 --> 00:43:46,075
Hey, look at that.

598
00:43:49,937 --> 00:43:51,700
I think it looks like my friend Paulie.

599
00:43:53,715 --> 00:43:55,120
Is he also bald and amorphous?

600
00:43:55,479 --> 00:43:56,510
No, he's the dad.

601
00:43:59,965 --> 00:44:00,980
Can you tell if it's a boy or a girl?

602
00:44:02,432 --> 00:44:05,918
I can't, the doctor can. But I
kind of want it to be a surprise.

603
00:44:07,355 --> 00:44:09,448
Well, it can only go one of two ways.

604
00:44:10,151 --> 00:44:11,166
That's what you think.

605
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:16,151
I drink tons of booze so you might end up with one
of those scary neuter-babies that's born without junk.

606
00:44:16,979 --> 00:44:17,745
Junk, huh?

607
00:44:18,838 --> 00:44:19,869
You know, it's parts.

608
00:44:20,181 --> 00:44:21,183
I know what junk is.

609
00:44:21,636 --> 00:44:22,152
Yeah, right.

610
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:23,464
We definitely want it to
have some junk, please.

611
00:44:24,417 --> 00:44:25,620
Well, you don't need
to worry about a thing.

612
00:44:26,323 --> 00:44:29,623
My stepmom, Bren, makes
me eat super healthy.

613
00:44:30,324 --> 00:44:32,509
I can't stand in front of
the microwave and no red M&Ms.

614
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:35,306
I hope you're ready.

615
00:44:37,417 --> 00:44:38,760
Ooh... do you hear that?

616
00:44:39,997 --> 00:44:40,650
What?

617
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:45,086
This is my favorite song. It's Sonic
Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters.

618
00:44:45,714 --> 00:44:47,181
Oh, yeah, yeah, I know the Carpenters.

619
00:44:48,009 --> 00:44:50,899
Chick drummer, freaky dude.
Not unlike the White Stripes.

620
00:44:51,305 --> 00:44:53,572
You haven't heard the Carpenters
like this. Just listen.

621
00:45:02,714 --> 00:45:05,169
Yeah, I like this.

622
00:45:06,356 --> 00:45:07,558
What did you say your favorite band was?

623
00:45:07,921 --> 00:45:13,137
Didn't. It's a three-way tie between the
Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways.

624
00:45:13,403 --> 00:45:15,948
I definitely need to make you some
CDs. At least while my kid's in there.

625
00:45:21,636 --> 00:45:22,636
The Wizard of Gore?

626
00:45:23,418 --> 00:45:25,995
That is Herschel Gordon Lewis.
He's the ultimate master of horror.

627
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:30,933
Please. Dario Argento is so
the ultimate master of horror.

628
00:45:32,276 --> 00:45:33,245
Argento?

629
00:45:33,729 --> 00:45:36,900
He's alright, but Lewis
is completely dimented.

630
00:45:37,621 --> 00:45:39,364
We're talking buckets of goo.

631
00:45:39,365 --> 00:45:43,933
Red corn syrup all over the place.
Fake brains coming out the yin-yang.

632
00:45:44,668 --> 00:45:47,120
Quite frankly, this
looks a little stupid.

633
00:45:49,244 --> 00:45:50,025
Give me the tape.

634
00:46:05,025 --> 00:46:07,074
This is even better than Suspiria.

635
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:08,354
What'd I tell ya?

636
00:46:08,698 --> 00:46:12,228
You have decent taste in slasher movies.

637
00:46:13,202 --> 00:46:14,492
Here's to dovetailing interests.

638
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:19,798
Have you guys thought of
any names for the baby yet?

639
00:46:21,781 --> 00:46:24,986
Sort of, yes. Vanessa
likes Madison for a girl.

640
00:46:28,703 --> 00:46:30,374
Madison?

641
00:46:32,327 --> 00:46:35,422
Isn't that a little, gay?

642
00:46:38,342 --> 00:46:41,313
Well, pretentious much? Should everyone
just have a mysterious name like Juno?

643
00:46:44,328 --> 00:46:48,204
My dad went through this huge obsession
with Roman and Greek mythology.

644
00:46:48,626 --> 00:46:51,609
He decided to name me after Zeus's wife,

645
00:46:52,218 --> 00:46:56,687
Zeus had tons of lays, but I'm
pretty sure Juno was his only wife.

646
00:46:58,139 --> 00:47:01,891
She was supposed to be really beautiful
but really mean. Like Diana Ross.

647
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:04,672
That suits you.

648
00:47:06,580 --> 00:47:07,624
Thanks?

649
00:47:11,107 --> 00:47:12,281
You're something else.

650
00:47:18,028 --> 00:47:19,531
Vanessa. You'd better go.

651
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:23,972
She hates when I sit around watching
movies and I don't contribute.

652
00:47:25,778 --> 00:47:29,091
I'll handle this. I'm really
good at diffusing mom-type rage.

653
00:47:29,341 --> 00:47:30,076
No, Juno, no.

654
00:47:32,934 --> 00:47:34,234
Juno, what's going on?

655
00:47:34,686 --> 00:47:35,936
- Nothing.
- What are you doing here? What's wrong?

656
00:47:36,204 --> 00:47:37,404
Nothing, I went to the doctor today.

657
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:38,591
Is there something wrong with the baby?

658
00:47:38,841 --> 00:47:39,438
The baby is great.

659
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,762
It's the right size and everything.
I even saw its phalanges today!

660
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:43,660
Here.

661
00:47:45,414 --> 00:47:45,997
It's the baby.

662
00:47:47,104 --> 00:47:47,720
It's your baby.

663
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,343
It kinda looks like it's waving.

664
00:47:55,680 --> 00:47:58,703
Like it's saying "Hey,
Vanessa. Will you be my mom?"

665
00:47:59,656 --> 00:48:00,932
Yeah, it kind of does.

666
00:48:01,972 --> 00:48:04,140
Juno was nice enough to
bring that over for us today.

667
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:06,192
I came as soon as I got that
ultrasound goo off my pelvis.

668
00:48:07,684 --> 00:48:09,728
It was crazy actually,

669
00:48:10,279 --> 00:48:14,568
My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound
tech so we got escorted off the premises.

670
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:21,703
Wow, what kind of swag did you score?

671
00:48:22,748 --> 00:48:23,716
Mall madness, huh?

672
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:25,435
It's just some stuff I
picked up for the baby.

673
00:48:26,497 --> 00:48:28,652
Don't you usually get all
that stuff at a baby shower?

674
00:48:29,324 --> 00:48:32,745
When my stepmom was pregnant with my
little sister she got a million gifts.

675
00:48:33,528 --> 00:48:35,684
But I wasn't jealous 'cause
they all were super lame.

676
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,683
I doubt anyone's gonna
throw us a shower.

677
00:48:38,432 --> 00:48:39,888
Why wouldn't they
throw you a baby shower?

678
00:48:40,278 --> 00:48:45,730
I don't think people know how to feel about
this situation because it's not set in stone.

679
00:48:47,139 --> 00:48:48,011
What isn't set...

680
00:48:50,699 --> 00:48:52,901
You don't think I'm
going to flake out on you?

681
00:48:53,464 --> 00:48:54,400
No, I don't, Juno.

682
00:48:55,747 --> 00:48:57,402
We went through a situation before

683
00:48:58,152 --> 00:48:59,090
where it didn't work out.

684
00:48:59,308 --> 00:49:00,417
Cold feet.

685
00:49:05,948 --> 00:49:07,011
You should have gone to China.

686
00:49:08,744 --> 00:49:11,215
I hear they give away
babies like free iPods.

687
00:49:12,761 --> 00:49:14,167
They put боem in those T-shirt guns

688
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:16,400
and shoot them out at sporting events.

689
00:49:19,415 --> 00:49:21,745
Your parents are probably
wondering where you are.

690
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,791
Naah. I'm already pregnant,

691
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:26,352
so what other kind of
shenanigans could I get into?

692
00:49:27,901 --> 00:49:29,307
I should probably bounce.

693
00:49:29,806 --> 00:49:30,806
Hey, don't forget your bag.

694
00:49:31,385 --> 00:49:32,244
Ah, bag!

695
00:49:37,728 --> 00:49:38,744
Okay, take care.

696
00:50:01,638 --> 00:50:02,605
Where the hell have you been, Junebug?

697
00:50:04,027 --> 00:50:06,736
I just drove to St. Cloud to show
Mark and Vanessa the ultrasound.

698
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:08,434
I ended up staying
for a couple of hours.

699
00:50:09,184 --> 00:50:11,605
A couple of hours? Why are you
going over there in the first place?

700
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:16,980
They wanted to know about this stuff.
I said I'd keep them updated, so I did!

701
00:50:17,398 --> 00:50:18,975
You could have mailed it to them.

702
00:50:19,287 --> 00:50:21,926
Why would you drive an hour
out to East Jesus, Nowhere?

703
00:50:23,944 --> 00:50:26,131
I don't know, I just did.

704
00:50:26,723 --> 00:50:28,508
And while Mark and I
were waiting for Vanessa,

705
00:50:28,509 --> 00:50:29,723
we watched The Wizard of Gore,

706
00:50:31,316 --> 00:50:34,020
And he burned me a couple
of CDs of this weird music.

707
00:50:35,020 --> 00:50:35,958
He's kind of cool.

708
00:50:38,457 --> 00:50:41,771
Juno, you can't just
drop in on them like that.

709
00:50:42,864 --> 00:50:46,581
No, it was not a big deal.
He was totally cool with it.

710
00:50:46,974 --> 00:50:47,881
You don't understand.

711
00:50:48,177 --> 00:50:50,161
Mark is a married man,
there are boundaries.

712
00:50:51,285 --> 00:50:52,257
Oh, come on.

713
00:50:52,566 --> 00:50:53,428
Listen,

714
00:50:53,740 --> 00:50:54,753
Bren-duhhh.

715
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:58,836
You're acting like you're the
one who has to go through this

716
00:50:58,837 --> 00:51:02,084
and get huge and shove a baby
out of your vag for someone else.

717
00:51:03,864 --> 00:51:05,392
What does it even
matter if he's married?

718
00:51:05,393 --> 00:51:06,738
I can have friends that are married.

719
00:51:07,129 --> 00:51:08,468
It doesn't work that way, kiddo.

720
00:51:08,469 --> 00:51:10,770
You don't know squat about
the dynamics of marriage.

721
00:51:11,114 --> 00:51:12,222
You don't know anything about me!

722
00:51:12,535 --> 00:51:13,379
I know enough.

723
00:51:16,351 --> 00:51:17,255
We don't even have a dog!

724
00:51:17,814 --> 00:51:20,363
Yeah, because you're
allergic to their saliva.

725
00:51:21,644 --> 00:51:25,189
I have sacrificed a lot for you, Juno.
But in a couple years when you move out

726
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:27,238
I'm going to get Weimaraners.

727
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:28,909
Wow, dream big!

728
00:51:29,206 --> 00:51:30,564
Oh, go fly a kite.

729
00:51:55,548 --> 00:51:56,141
Hi, Juno.

730
00:51:57,206 --> 00:51:57,987
What can I do for you?

731
00:51:59,892 --> 00:52:00,845
Bleeker home?

732
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:03,563
Bleeker's mom was
possibly attractive once.

733
00:52:04,096 --> 00:52:05,284
But now she looks a hobbit.

734
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:09,252
You know, the fat one
that was in The Goonies.

735
00:52:17,332 --> 00:52:18,171
Hey, man,

736
00:52:18,893 --> 00:52:20,830
Don't concentrate so hard.
I think I can smell your hair all burning.

737
00:52:22,236 --> 00:52:22,986
Hey, what's up?

738
00:52:23,252 --> 00:52:26,326
Not much, I just wanted to come say hey.

739
00:52:26,327 --> 00:52:29,939
I miss hanging out with
you on school nights.

740
00:52:32,204 --> 00:52:34,580
Orange Tic-Tacs are
Bleeker's one and only vice.

741
00:52:35,717 --> 00:52:39,001
The day I got pregnant, his mouth
tasted really tangy and delicious.

742
00:52:49,156 --> 00:52:50,392
You seem to be getting...

743
00:52:51,013 --> 00:52:52,204
...pregnant-er these days.

744
00:52:55,484 --> 00:52:57,858
Ya know, I set up this
whole private adoption...

745
00:52:58,454 --> 00:53:03,203
...and this married couple in Saint
Cloud are going to be the parents.

746
00:53:03,829 --> 00:53:04,419
Really?

747
00:53:05,624 --> 00:53:06,796
What are they like?

748
00:53:07,154 --> 00:53:09,764
The guy, he's awesome.

749
00:53:10,717 --> 00:53:11,795
His name is Mark and

750
00:53:12,624 --> 00:53:15,125
he likes old horror movies
and he plays the guitar.

751
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:17,203
We actually hung out this afternoon.

752
00:53:18,045 --> 00:53:19,044
Is that normal?

753
00:53:19,935 --> 00:53:21,140
Probably not, but...

754
00:53:22,123 --> 00:53:26,108
I talked to dad and Bren and they said
they wouldn't narc you out to your folks,

755
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:28,063
So,

756
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:30,247
I think we should be cool.

757
00:53:31,218 --> 00:53:32,139
That's a relief.

758
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:39,952
I'm gonna start looking

759
00:53:40,501 --> 00:53:41,638
like a pretty big dork soon.

760
00:53:43,372 --> 00:53:45,890
Will you still think
I'm cute when I'm huge?

761
00:53:47,217 --> 00:53:48,716
I always think you're cute.

762
00:53:49,637 --> 00:53:50,656
I think you're beautiful.

763
00:53:51,434 --> 00:53:52,324
Jeez, Bleek.

764
00:53:53,574 --> 00:53:54,530
I do.

765
00:53:58,028 --> 00:54:01,233
Hey Junebug, when this is all over
we should get the band back together.

766
00:54:02,044 --> 00:54:03,591
Yeah.

767
00:54:04,700 --> 00:54:05,637
That would be awesome.

768
00:54:06,106 --> 00:54:07,924
Once Tino gets a new drumhead

769
00:54:08,135 --> 00:54:10,060
we're just, like, ready to rock.

770
00:54:11,606 --> 00:54:13,809
We could always get back together too.

771
00:54:14,639 --> 00:54:15,667
That's an option.

772
00:54:20,292 --> 00:54:21,920
Were we together?

773
00:54:22,621 --> 00:54:23,669
Yeah, we were once.

774
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:26,997
That time.

775
00:54:33,746 --> 00:54:34,807
What about Katrina De Voort?

776
00:54:35,602 --> 00:54:37,447
You could totally go out
with Katrina De Voort.

777
00:54:37,822 --> 00:54:39,727
I don't like Katrina.

778
00:54:40,446 --> 00:54:41,352
She smells like soup.

779
00:54:41,899 --> 00:54:43,070
Her whole house smells of soup.

780
00:54:52,655 --> 00:54:53,483
Okay.

781
00:54:55,247 --> 00:54:58,234
So we have Custard, Cheesecake.

782
00:54:59,405 --> 00:55:00,342
They're yellow.

783
00:55:02,388 --> 00:55:04,479
I wanted to pick something
that was gender-neutral until

784
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,717
we get the baby and then we
can add a more decisive palette.

785
00:55:08,622 --> 00:55:11,765
Why does everyone think
yellow is gender-neutral?

786
00:55:12,123 --> 00:55:13,184
I don't know any guy
with a yellow bedroom.

787
00:55:16,155 --> 00:55:18,421
I'm thinking more
Custard with this light.

788
00:55:19,998 --> 00:55:22,529
I don't know. Maybe I should
paint a larger swatch...

789
00:55:26,874 --> 00:55:28,105
Or you could wait a few more months.

790
00:55:29,404 --> 00:55:32,574
It's not like the baby's going to storm
in here demanding dessert-colored walls.

791
00:55:37,997 --> 00:55:43,869
"What to Expect" says that readying the baby's
room is an important process for the woman.

792
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:46,496
Especially if you're adopting.
It's called "nesting. "

793
00:55:47,809 --> 00:55:48,811
Nesting?

794
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:52,779
Are you going to build the
crib out of sticks and spit?

795
00:55:56,012 --> 00:56:00,278
You should read the book. I flagged
the "daddy chapters" for you.

796
00:56:00,621 --> 00:56:01,933
I think it's too early to paint.

797
00:56:02,418 --> 00:56:03,480
That's my opinion.

798
00:56:04,854 --> 00:56:05,838
I disagree.

799
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:11,464
This wall is going to need something.

800
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:16,980
Our first family photo
right in the middle.

801
00:56:18,198 --> 00:56:19,136
Right up there.

802
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:23,746
Can you see it?

803
00:56:27,949 --> 00:56:30,292
Yum! This pretzel tastes
like a friggin' donut!

804
00:56:30,731 --> 00:56:31,761
Share the love, sweetness!

805
00:56:32,136 --> 00:56:33,011
You can't have any.

806
00:56:35,026 --> 00:56:35,979
She's assaulting me!

807
00:56:36,948 --> 00:56:38,198
She's denying me fresh-baked goodness!

808
00:56:39,261 --> 00:56:40,167
Oh, my God.

809
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:43,415
That's her. That's Vanessa Loring.

810
00:56:44,808 --> 00:56:46,133
Of the Penny Saver Lorings?

811
00:56:50,010 --> 00:56:51,696
Dude, she's, like, really pretty.

812
00:56:52,012 --> 00:56:53,823
You sound totally shocked or something.

813
00:56:55,682 --> 00:56:58,090
She's totally gonna steal
that kid for her collection.

814
00:56:58,618 --> 00:56:59,680
Right, seriously.

815
00:57:09,416 --> 00:57:10,432
Boring!

816
00:57:20,711 --> 00:57:25,291
I could so go for a huge cookie right now with like,
a lamb kebab, simultaneously.

817
00:57:26,306 --> 00:57:28,836
God, Spermy. Must you always feed?

818
00:57:29,447 --> 00:57:32,384
It's like, never-ending for you.

819
00:57:33,681 --> 00:57:34,571
Juno!

820
00:57:34,836 --> 00:57:35,667
Hi, Vanessa!

821
00:57:36,055 --> 00:57:38,116
What brings you to the mall today?

822
00:57:38,619 --> 00:57:40,759
I was just shopping with my girlfriends.

823
00:57:41,430 --> 00:57:42,711
You're gay?

824
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:43,695
No.

825
00:57:44,008 --> 00:57:45,276
Just ignore her.

826
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:46,943
Well, how are you feeling?

827
00:57:47,148 --> 00:57:49,055
Great! Everything's stupendous.

828
00:57:49,399 --> 00:57:52,288
Oh, coming in on that snooze button.

829
00:57:54,789 --> 00:57:55,649
That's incredible.

830
00:57:56,836 --> 00:57:57,836
Oh, God.

831
00:57:59,132 --> 00:57:59,976
What?

832
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:01,600
Kicking away.

833
00:58:04,726 --> 00:58:06,663
Could I feel it?

834
00:58:07,756 --> 00:58:08,881
Are you kidding?

835
00:58:11,180 --> 00:58:14,443
At school everyone's just
grabbing my belly all the time.

836
00:58:14,959 --> 00:58:17,180
I'm a legend.
They call me the Cautionary Whale.

837
00:58:21,804 --> 00:58:22,865
I can't feel anything.

838
00:58:26,255 --> 00:58:27,288
It's not moving for me.

839
00:58:29,865 --> 00:58:31,220
You should try talking to it.

840
00:58:31,221 --> 00:58:34,866
They can hear you, even though it's
all ten thousand leagues under the sea.

841
00:58:50,523 --> 00:58:51,443
Hi, baby.

842
00:58:56,788 --> 00:58:58,834
It's me. It's Vanessa.

843
00:59:03,909 --> 00:59:05,739
I can't wait to meet you.

844
00:59:13,128 --> 00:59:15,052
Can you hear me, baby?

845
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:17,738
Sweet angel?

846
00:59:28,786 --> 00:59:30,238
I felt it!

847
00:59:32,644 --> 00:59:33,787
That was magical.

848
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,284
Thank you.

849
00:59:40,769 --> 00:59:41,784
Thank you.

850
01:00:34,388 --> 01:00:35,045
Hello?

851
01:00:35,545 --> 01:00:36,340
Hey!

852
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:40,358
So, I've been listening to that
really weird CD that you made me.

853
01:00:40,748 --> 01:00:41,748
Yeah? What's the verdict?

854
01:00:42,310 --> 01:00:43,498
Well, it's cute.

855
01:00:44,078 --> 01:00:45,172
It's cute?

856
01:00:45,465 --> 01:00:48,272
When you're used to listening to the
raw power of Iggy and the Stooges,

857
01:00:48,765 --> 01:00:51,672
everything else just sounds
kind of precious in comparison.

858
01:00:52,702 --> 01:00:55,404
I imagine you have a collection of
punk chestnuts to prove your point.

859
01:00:56,155 --> 01:00:57,013
Well...

860
01:00:57,576 --> 01:00:59,106
...consider it your musical education.

861
01:01:00,184 --> 01:01:01,499
I can't wait to see what
you've got to teach me.

862
01:01:02,357 --> 01:01:04,138
Stop surfing porn and get back to work.

863
01:01:05,528 --> 01:01:07,187
Just wanted to call and say hi.

864
01:01:08,139 --> 01:01:09,560
Go learn something.

865
01:01:11,529 --> 01:01:15,652
- Oh, a little trip down Mexico way.
- And Greece and China apparently.

866
01:01:16,635 --> 01:01:17,873
How many months has it been now?

867
01:01:18,263 --> 01:01:19,309
You're getting huge.

868
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,933
It's homing in on the eight. You
should see how weird I look naked.

869
01:01:23,998 --> 01:01:25,466
I wish my funbags would get bigger.

870
01:01:26,044 --> 01:01:28,795
Trust me, you don't. I have to
actually wear a friggin' bra now

871
01:01:29,295 --> 01:01:34,840
and rub all this nasty cocoa butter
stuff on myself so my skin won't explode.

872
01:01:35,356 --> 01:01:36,183
Hot!

873
01:01:39,294 --> 01:01:40,732
Why is everyone always staring at me?

874
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:43,090
Well, you are kind of convex, you know?

875
01:01:44,948 --> 01:01:47,979
Whoah! Who's been doing their
geometry homework for once!

876
01:01:48,247 --> 01:01:51,511
I have no choice. Keith has
been grading me so hard lately.

877
01:01:51,855 --> 01:01:54,109
Do not call Mr. Conyers "Keith".

878
01:01:54,388 --> 01:01:56,668
'Cause my barf reflex is
really enheightened these days.

879
01:01:57,355 --> 01:01:58,402
But Keith's hot.

880
01:02:01,494 --> 01:02:03,137
Eww, he's all beardy!

881
01:02:04,824 --> 01:02:07,417
Did you hear that Bleek is going
to the prom with Katrina De Voort?

882
01:02:09,794 --> 01:02:10,652
Katrina?

883
01:02:11,293 --> 01:02:13,307
No way, he doesn't like Katrina.

884
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,010
Must be like a pity date or something.

885
01:02:15,228 --> 01:02:17,635
I heard he asked her and
that the're going to Benihana,

886
01:02:17,636 --> 01:02:19,699
and then prom, and then
Vijay's parents' cabin.

887
01:02:21,120 --> 01:02:23,276
He told me that Katrina's
house smells like soup!

888
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:25,041
Oh my God, it totally does.

889
01:02:25,372 --> 01:02:28,901
I was there four years ago for her birthday
party and it was like Lipton Landing.

890
01:02:29,932 --> 01:02:32,322
But you know, boys have endured
way worse things for nookie.

891
01:02:33,868 --> 01:02:34,852
Oh, please.

892
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,181
There is no way that they're having sex,

893
01:02:37,494 --> 01:02:38,836
They wouldn't even be holding hands.

894
01:02:39,165 --> 01:02:40,743
I wouldn't be so sure,
he did it with you.

895
01:02:41,324 --> 01:02:42,948
Yeah, 'cause Bleek trusts me.

896
01:02:43,651 --> 01:02:44,682
We're best friends.

897
01:02:45,090 --> 01:02:46,306
Are you jealous?

898
01:02:46,824 --> 01:02:49,776
I thought you said you
didn't care what he did.

899
01:02:50,085 --> 01:02:51,103
Not jealous, don't care.

900
01:02:51,292 --> 01:02:53,332
I know Bleek doesn't like
Katrina and he shouldn't

901
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:55,573
toy with her emotions like
that. She seems pretty nice.

902
01:02:56,274 --> 01:02:58,292
Uh-huh, I'm really convinced.

903
01:02:58,712 --> 01:03:00,322
Prom is for wenises, anyway.

904
01:03:00,524 --> 01:03:02,618
As soon as you're old enough
to go, it's so not cool anymore.

905
01:03:12,869 --> 01:03:15,277
Are you honestly and truly going
to the prom with Katrina De Voort?

906
01:03:16,977 --> 01:03:17,899
Uh, hi?

907
01:03:18,132 --> 01:03:20,272
Leah just said that you
were gonna go with her.

908
01:03:20,681 --> 01:03:22,649
Yeah, I did ask her if she wanted to go.

909
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,021
A bunch of us from the
team are going to Benihana,

910
01:03:26,022 --> 01:03:28,502
then go the prom, then go
to Vijay's parents' cabin.

911
01:03:31,781 --> 01:03:33,659
We're getting a stretch limo.

912
01:03:34,517 --> 01:03:36,564
Your mom must be pretty stoked
that you're not taking me.

913
01:03:38,781 --> 01:03:39,687
You're mad. Why are you mad?

914
01:03:41,140 --> 01:03:42,890
I'm not mad. I'm in a great mood.

915
01:03:43,249 --> 01:03:45,702
Despite the fact that I'm in
a fat suit I can't take off,

916
01:03:45,703 --> 01:03:47,985
despite the fact that pretty
much everyone is making

917
01:03:48,531 --> 01:03:51,069
fun of me behind my back,
despite the fact that your

918
01:03:51,070 --> 01:03:53,750
girlfriend gave me the
stinkeye in art class yesterday.

919
01:03:54,718 --> 01:03:57,673
Katrina's not my girlfriend! And I
doubt that she gave you the stinkeye.

920
01:03:58,935 --> 01:04:00,109
That's just the way her face looks.

921
01:04:03,764 --> 01:04:08,828
Just take Soupy Sales to prom, I can think
of so many cooler things to do that night.

922
01:04:09,234 --> 01:04:12,911
I might pumice my feet or go
to Bren's Unitarian church,

923
01:04:12,912 --> 01:04:16,265
maybe get hit by a truck
full of hot garbage juice.

924
01:04:16,733 --> 01:04:20,297
All those things would be exponentially
cooler than going to the prom with you.

925
01:04:23,780 --> 01:04:24,983
You're being really immature.

926
01:04:27,044 --> 01:04:30,329
You have no reason to be mad
at me. You broke my heart.

927
01:04:30,330 --> 01:04:32,676
I should be royally ticked off at you.

928
01:04:33,046 --> 01:04:36,546
I should be really cheesed off. I
shouldn't want to talk to you anymore.

929
01:04:38,295 --> 01:04:42,044
Why? Because I got bored and had sex with
you, and then I didn't wanna, like, marry you?

930
01:04:42,451 --> 01:04:45,531
Like I'd marry you! You'd
be the meanest wife ever.

931
01:04:45,780 --> 01:04:47,044
And I know that you
weren't bored that day

932
01:04:47,326 --> 01:04:48,991
because there was a lot of stuff on TV.

933
01:04:48,992 --> 01:04:51,809
The Blair Witch Project was
coming on Starz, and you were like,

934
01:04:52,076 --> 01:04:57,808
"I haven't seen this since it came out,
but we should make out instead. La la la. "

935
01:05:01,124 --> 01:05:03,169
You just take Katrina the
Douche Packer to the prom.

936
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:05,060
I'm sure you two will
have a real bitchin' time!

937
01:05:07,933 --> 01:05:09,029
I still have your underwear.

938
01:05:09,464 --> 01:05:10,870
I still have your virginity!

939
01:05:11,715 --> 01:05:12,684
Would you shut up!

940
01:05:13,153 --> 01:05:14,636
What? Are you ashamed that we did it?

941
01:05:15,434 --> 01:05:16,563
- No.
- 'Cause at least

942
01:05:16,811 --> 01:05:18,873
you don't have to have the
evidence under your sweater.

943
01:05:21,403 --> 01:05:22,403
I'm a planet!

944
01:05:26,916 --> 01:05:28,075
Wait, let me get your bag.

945
01:05:29,324 --> 01:05:30,496
What's another ten pounds?

946
01:06:17,598 --> 01:06:18,429
Hi.

947
01:06:18,895 --> 01:06:20,179
Wow. That shirt's working hard.

948
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:21,519
Is Vanessa here?

949
01:06:21,912 --> 01:06:23,583
No. We are safe.

950
01:06:25,816 --> 01:06:27,334
I'm glad you're here, I
actually have something for you.

951
01:06:32,278 --> 01:06:33,261
Almost there.

952
01:06:37,354 --> 01:06:39,731
Whoah, Mark! Is this the
baby's room? It's beautiful!

953
01:06:40,933 --> 01:06:41,824
Hilarious.

954
01:06:42,229 --> 01:06:44,198
This is where I keep all my old comics,

955
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:45,856
And I want to show you one.

956
01:06:46,916 --> 01:06:48,168
You're one of those guys?

957
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:49,526
Take a look.

958
01:06:53,056 --> 01:06:54,697
Most Fruitful Yuki?

959
01:06:56,136 --> 01:06:57,573
Is this a pregnant superhero?

960
01:06:58,182 --> 01:06:59,089
Isn't that great?

961
01:06:59,385 --> 01:07:00,709
I found it in Japan when
I was there with my band.

962
01:07:00,710 --> 01:07:01,306
It reminds me of you.

963
01:07:02,183 --> 01:07:03,307
Hells, yeah!

964
01:07:04,248 --> 01:07:07,388
This actually makes me
feel way less of a fat dork.

965
01:07:09,465 --> 01:07:10,444
Yuki is a real bad ass.

966
01:07:10,445 --> 01:07:12,826
You should be very proud
being in the same condition.

967
01:07:14,344 --> 01:07:15,111
Thank you.

968
01:07:16,346 --> 01:07:17,501
Oh, how about some tunage?

969
01:07:18,954 --> 01:07:20,610
Alright, don't look, no matter what.

970
01:07:23,608 --> 01:07:25,684
This one is actually kinda slow.

971
01:07:25,685 --> 01:07:30,030
But it's Mott the Hoople so it's
still totally rad and hardcore.

972
01:07:35,718 --> 01:07:36,578
I know this one.

973
01:07:36,968 --> 01:07:39,751
- You do?
- Yeah, this song is older than I am.

974
01:07:40,138 --> 01:07:42,015
I danced to this at my senior prom.

975
01:07:43,436 --> 01:07:44,811
Who'd you dance with?

976
01:07:45,548 --> 01:07:47,208
Cynthia Vogel, great dance partner.

977
01:07:47,209 --> 01:07:49,342
She let me put my
hands all over her butt.

978
01:07:49,591 --> 01:07:50,749
- Hot.
- Very hot.

979
01:07:52,357 --> 01:07:54,576
I can just, totally,
picture you dancing,

980
01:07:55,217 --> 01:07:56,780
Like a total dork!

981
01:07:59,968 --> 01:08:03,388
Her hands there,

982
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:05,343
And my hands down here.

983
01:08:06,186 --> 01:08:07,717
This is how we did it in '88.

984
01:08:08,092 --> 01:08:09,107
Like this?

985
01:08:09,482 --> 01:08:10,422
Just like this.

986
01:08:10,622 --> 01:08:11,980
You've never been to a dance before?

987
01:08:12,234 --> 01:08:13,546
Dances are for nerds and squares.

988
01:08:15,122 --> 01:08:15,873
What are you?

989
01:08:16,903 --> 01:08:17,872
I don't know.

990
01:08:20,249 --> 01:08:21,607
I feel like there's
something between us.

991
01:08:39,559 --> 01:08:40,530
I'm leaving Vanessa.

992
01:08:44,201 --> 01:08:44,872
What?

993
01:08:45,294 --> 01:08:46,943
I'm getting a place in the city.

994
01:08:46,944 --> 01:08:49,623
It's something I've wanted
to do for a long time.

995
01:08:49,898 --> 01:08:50,586
No!

996
01:08:51,352 --> 01:08:51,947
No?

997
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,932
No! You definitely can't do that.

998
01:08:54,212 --> 01:08:55,337
That's one big, fat sack of no!

999
01:08:57,772 --> 01:08:58,729
What is the matter?

1000
01:09:00,119 --> 01:09:03,070
You guys are supposed
to take care of this.

1001
01:09:04,726 --> 01:09:07,243
I thought you'd be cool with this.

1002
01:09:07,556 --> 01:09:09,253
I want things to be perfect.

1003
01:09:09,254 --> 01:09:13,678
I don't want them to be shitty and
broken like everyone else's family.

1004
01:09:15,540 --> 01:09:19,144
Look, I'll have the baby, and
Vanessa is going to be so happy.

1005
01:09:20,075 --> 01:09:21,653
A baby is not going to fix everything.

1006
01:09:21,996 --> 01:09:24,513
Besides, I don't know if I'm
even ready to be a father.

1007
01:09:25,038 --> 01:09:26,069
But you're old!

1008
01:09:30,726 --> 01:09:31,695
How do you think of me?

1009
01:09:32,773 --> 01:09:34,038
Why are you over here?

1010
01:09:37,758 --> 01:09:38,899
I...

1011
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:43,068
I just like being a piece of
furniture in your weird life.

1012
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:48,094
This is what my life has
become. I got stuff in boxes.

1013
01:09:48,095 --> 01:09:50,959
I'm underground.
That's appealing to you?

1014
01:09:51,384 --> 01:09:52,540
- This is my fault.
- No.

1015
01:09:52,789 --> 01:09:54,586
Is Vanessa mad at you because of me?

1016
01:09:55,179 --> 01:09:57,343
That's got nothing to do with it.
Vanessa and I aren't in love anymore.

1017
01:09:57,939 --> 01:09:59,708
You were in love when you married her!

1018
01:10:00,493 --> 01:10:02,763
If you're in love once,
you can be in love again.

1019
01:10:02,764 --> 01:10:05,714
My friend Leah has been with the
same guy four different times.

1020
01:10:06,716 --> 01:10:07,871
You're just not trying hard enough.

1021
01:10:08,137 --> 01:10:09,183
I'm such an idiot. I can't
believe what an idiot I am.

1022
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:10,277
No, you know what, Mark.

1023
01:10:10,823 --> 01:10:12,947
Do not divorce your wife!

1024
01:10:14,260 --> 01:10:17,527
Will you please just do me a
solid and stay with Vanessa?

1025
01:10:19,963 --> 01:10:20,806
You're so young.

1026
01:10:21,512 --> 01:10:22,911
I'm not that young.
I'm sixteen.

1027
01:10:22,912 --> 01:10:25,885
I'm old enough to know when
someone's acting like a total a-hole!

1028
01:10:26,994 --> 01:10:27,932
Oh, and you know what,

1029
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:32,370
I bought another Sonic Youth album
and it sucks! It's just noise!

1030
01:10:38,375 --> 01:10:39,576
Juno? What's going on?

1031
01:10:41,184 --> 01:10:41,871
Nothing.

1032
01:10:42,964 --> 01:10:43,699
Why are you crying?

1033
01:10:44,792 --> 01:10:47,556
I'm not crying. I'm just
allergic to fine home furnishings.

1034
01:10:49,324 --> 01:10:50,028
What's the matter?

1035
01:10:50,777 --> 01:10:51,854
What's the matter?

1036
01:10:52,541 --> 01:10:55,095
She's just a little
hormonal. Right, Juno?

1037
01:10:55,096 --> 01:10:56,699
It's part of the process.

1038
01:11:01,115 --> 01:11:02,036
What did you do?

1039
01:11:04,570 --> 01:11:05,475
I didn't do anything...

1040
01:11:07,615 --> 01:11:08,443
Just...

1041
01:11:13,178 --> 01:11:14,037
I've been thinking.

1042
01:11:15,084 --> 01:11:17,820
- What?
- Just thinking if this is the right thing.

1043
01:11:19,803 --> 01:11:20,709
What are you talking about?

1044
01:11:22,865 --> 01:11:23,818
Just wondering if it's,

1045
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:25,647
Just wondering if we're ready.

1046
01:11:27,272 --> 01:11:28,365
Yeah, we're ready.

1047
01:11:28,819 --> 01:11:31,809
We're ready. We've read the
books, we've taken all the classes.

1048
01:11:31,810 --> 01:11:33,725
We have a nursery that is completely...

1049
01:11:34,191 --> 01:11:39,442
Vanessa, I know we're prepared.
I'm just wondering if... I'm ready.

1050
01:11:44,895 --> 01:11:45,661
Wait a minute.

1051
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:49,318
Juno, don't listen to him.
He's just got cold feet.

1052
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:50,865
He's just being a guy.

1053
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:52,431
The books all say the same thing.

1054
01:11:52,432 --> 01:11:54,442
A woman becomes a mother
when she gets pregnant.

1055
01:11:54,878 --> 01:11:57,035
A man becomes a father
when he sees his baby.

1056
01:11:58,588 --> 01:12:01,044
He's going to get there.

1057
01:12:01,543 --> 01:12:02,417
It just happened so fast.

1058
01:12:02,418 --> 01:12:05,495
We put the ad in the paper and I thought
it was gonna take months if at all and then,

1059
01:12:06,072 --> 01:12:08,262
Two weeks later, she's on that couch.

1060
01:12:08,793 --> 01:12:09,886
She answered our prayers.

1061
01:12:10,184 --> 01:12:12,935
Ever since then it's
been like a ticking clock.

1062
01:12:16,880 --> 01:12:18,427
What are you saying?

1063
01:12:21,475 --> 01:12:23,068
That it feels a little like bad timing.

1064
01:12:26,654 --> 01:12:28,684
What would be a good time for you, Mark?

1065
01:12:30,872 --> 01:12:32,624
There's just some things
that I still want to do.

1066
01:12:33,732 --> 01:12:34,935
Like what? Be a rock star?

1067
01:12:36,513 --> 01:12:37,293
Don't mock me.

1068
01:12:39,186 --> 01:12:40,202
I'm just saying that this is,

1069
01:12:41,529 --> 01:12:42,856
This is something that's
never going to happen.

1070
01:12:47,748 --> 01:12:48,716
Your shirt is stupid.

1071
01:12:50,434 --> 01:12:51,308
Grow up.

1072
01:12:52,028 --> 01:12:54,139
If I have to wait for
you to become Kurt Cobain,

1073
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:55,560
I'm never going to be a mother.

1074
01:13:00,199 --> 01:13:01,418
I never said I'd be a good father.

1075
01:15:57,873 --> 01:16:01,451
I called Gerta Rauss and she said
that she can represent both of us.

1076
01:16:01,452 --> 01:16:03,577
It's called a "collaborative divorce. "

1077
01:16:05,155 --> 01:16:06,622
It's all the rage right now, supposedly.

1078
01:16:07,656 --> 01:16:09,295
And it would be pretty easy
because we don't have any children.

1079
01:16:10,308 --> 01:16:11,483
Thanks for making the call, I guess.

1080
01:16:19,638 --> 01:16:20,794
Have you found a place to stay yet?

1081
01:16:21,684 --> 01:16:24,306
- Yeah, downtown.
- A hotel?

1082
01:16:24,718 --> 01:16:26,811
No, it's not a hotel. It's a loft.

1083
01:16:27,888 --> 01:16:29,012
Aren't you the cool guy?

1084
01:16:35,169 --> 01:16:36,372
I wanted a baby so bad.

1085
01:16:37,902 --> 01:16:39,011
I know.

1086
01:16:59,152 --> 01:17:00,963
- It looks like a bill from
Jiffy-Lube. - It's for me.

1087
01:17:43,730 --> 01:17:45,924
I never realize how much
I like being home unless

1088
01:17:45,925 --> 01:17:48,118
I've been somewhere really
different for a while.

1089
01:17:57,386 --> 01:17:58,289
Hey, Dad.

1090
01:17:58,617 --> 01:17:59,853
Hey, big puffy version of Junebug.

1091
01:18:01,447 --> 01:18:02,290
Where have you been?

1092
01:18:02,603 --> 01:18:05,807
Dealing with things way
beyond my maturity level.

1093
01:18:09,290 --> 01:18:10,290
Where is everybody?

1094
01:18:10,946 --> 01:18:13,601
Bren took Liberty Bell to
her tot ice skating class.

1095
01:18:15,056 --> 01:18:17,524
When will you guys learn
that tots can't ice skate?

1096
01:18:19,539 --> 01:18:20,837
You're looking a little morose, honey.

1097
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:22,650
What's eating you?

1098
01:18:31,414 --> 01:18:33,602
I'm just, like, losing
my faith with humanity.

1099
01:18:34,776 --> 01:18:36,150
Can you narrow that down for me?

1100
01:18:38,068 --> 01:18:38,899
I just...

1101
01:18:39,321 --> 01:18:40,180
...wonder if...

1102
01:18:41,913 --> 01:18:43,851
...two people can
stay together for good.

1103
01:18:45,446 --> 01:18:46,352
You mean like couples?

1104
01:18:46,788 --> 01:18:47,555
Yeah, like,

1105
01:18:48,007 --> 01:18:49,054
People in love.

1106
01:18:50,678 --> 01:18:52,829
Are you having boy trouble
'cause I gotta be honest;

1107
01:18:52,830 --> 01:18:55,304
I don't really much approve of
you dating in your condition,

1108
01:18:56,320 --> 01:18:57,633
That's kind of messed up.

1109
01:18:57,752 --> 01:18:58,596
No, dad!

1110
01:18:59,236 --> 01:19:00,129
I mean, that's pretty skanky.

1111
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:02,384
Isn't that what you girls
call it? Skanky? Skeevy?

1112
01:19:02,456 --> 01:19:03,690
Please stop.

1113
01:19:04,034 --> 01:19:04,846
Tore up from the floor up?

1114
01:19:05,268 --> 01:19:07,235
That's not what it's about.

1115
01:19:11,458 --> 01:19:17,891
I just need to know that it's possible that
two people can stay happy together forever.

1116
01:19:19,501 --> 01:19:20,767
It's not easy, that's for sure.

1117
01:19:22,079 --> 01:19:25,299
I don't have the best track
record in the world, I know, but,

1118
01:19:26,563 --> 01:19:28,376
I've been with your
stepmother for ten years now,

1119
01:19:29,484 --> 01:19:30,812
and I'm proud to say
that we're very happy.

1120
01:19:33,204 --> 01:19:34,063
Look...

1121
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:36,392
...In my opinion...

1122
01:19:37,188 --> 01:19:42,859
The best thing you can do is find a person
who loves you for exactly what you are.

1123
01:19:44,734 --> 01:19:47,596
Good mood, bad mood, ugly, pretty,

1124
01:19:48,438 --> 01:19:50,001
Handsome, what have you,

1125
01:19:51,812 --> 01:19:54,124
the right person is still gonna
think the sun shines out of your ass.

1126
01:19:58,078 --> 01:19:59,452
That's the kind of person
that's worth sticking with.

1127
01:20:01,093 --> 01:20:01,689
Yeah.

1128
01:20:06,062 --> 01:20:07,780
I think I've found that person.

1129
01:20:08,874 --> 01:20:10,248
Yeah, sure you
have. Your old D-A-D!

1130
01:20:12,188 --> 01:20:15,390
You know I'll always be there to love you, support
you, no matter what kind of pickle you're in.

1131
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:18,267
Obviously.

1132
01:20:23,593 --> 01:20:24,483
Dad, I think i'm just gonna,

1133
01:20:25,576 --> 01:20:27,016
shove out for a sec, but,

1134
01:20:27,703 --> 01:20:28,968
I won't be home late.

1135
01:20:29,561 --> 01:20:30,404
Okay.

1136
01:20:31,732 --> 01:20:32,904
You were talking about me, right?

1137
01:20:34,187 --> 01:20:34,903
Oh, yeah.

1138
01:21:31,378 --> 01:21:32,487
Hi.

1139
01:21:34,893 --> 01:21:37,345
Did you put like a hundred
things of tic tacs in my mailbox?

1140
01:21:38,033 --> 01:21:39,344
Oh, yeah, that was me.

1141
01:21:40,657 --> 01:21:41,534
Why?

1142
01:21:41,924 --> 01:21:43,330
They're your fave.

1143
01:21:44,095 --> 01:21:47,000
You can never have too many of your
favorite one-calorie breath mint.

1144
01:21:47,829 --> 01:21:49,814
Yeah, well thanks, I...

1145
01:21:50,048 --> 01:21:52,954
...I think I'm pretty much set
until college on the tic tac front.

1146
01:21:54,316 --> 01:21:55,500
You know, Bleek, I was thinking.

1147
01:21:56,049 --> 01:21:59,813
I'm sorry I was such a huge bitch
to you. You don't deserve it.

1148
01:22:01,063 --> 01:22:03,164
It's okay.

1149
01:22:04,835 --> 01:22:05,897
Also,

1150
01:22:08,259 --> 01:22:09,320
I think I'm in love with you.

1151
01:22:12,038 --> 01:22:13,259
What, you mean as friends?

1152
01:22:14,117 --> 01:22:14,836
No.

1153
01:22:15,914 --> 01:22:17,039
I mean, for real.

1154
01:22:17,976 --> 01:22:21,353
Because you're, like, the
coolest person I've ever met.

1155
01:22:22,020 --> 01:22:23,852
And you don't even have to try.

1156
01:22:26,428 --> 01:22:27,759
I try really hard, actually.

1157
01:22:28,212 --> 01:22:29,615
You're, like, naturally smart.

1158
01:22:30,757 --> 01:22:31,852
You're not like everyone else.

1159
01:22:32,554 --> 01:22:35,006
You don't stare at my stomach
all the time, you look at my face.

1160
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:41,318
And every time I see you, the
baby starts kicking super hard.

1161
01:22:42,350 --> 01:22:43,459
It does?

1162
01:22:56,133 --> 01:22:58,651
I think it's because my heart
starts pounding everytime I see you.

1163
01:23:00,227 --> 01:23:01,054
Mine too.

1164
01:23:03,974 --> 01:23:05,680
That's all I could ask for.

1165
01:23:09,225 --> 01:23:10,256
You're golden, man.

1166
01:23:13,583 --> 01:23:15,163
Can we make out now?

1167
01:23:16,612 --> 01:23:17,818
Yeah.

1168
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:33,817
You know, you can go into early
labor sucking face like that!

1169
01:23:57,967 --> 01:23:58,967
Dad!

1170
01:24:00,045 --> 01:24:00,858
What?

1171
01:24:01,732 --> 01:24:03,656
Dad, either I just peed my pants or...

1172
01:24:05,436 --> 01:24:06,389
Or?

1173
01:24:07,436 --> 01:24:09,138
Thundercats are go!

1174
01:24:09,498 --> 01:24:10,247
All out, all out!

1175
01:24:11,470 --> 01:24:12,467
Do you have the admittance form?

1176
01:24:12,811 --> 01:24:14,299
What about the parking stickers?

1177
01:24:14,514 --> 01:24:15,576
Have you got Liberty Bell?

1178
01:24:15,763 --> 01:24:17,795
Oh, sweetie, sweetie!

1179
01:24:21,638 --> 01:24:22,500
Here we go.

1180
01:24:25,843 --> 01:24:27,202
Hurry! Start the car, go!

1181
01:24:27,827 --> 01:24:29,045
Gas!

1182
01:24:33,434 --> 01:24:35,811
- Wait, wait!
- Out of the way!

1183
01:24:39,528 --> 01:24:40,858
- Don't do that.
- What?

1184
01:24:41,246 --> 01:24:42,827
- That.
- But it's fun!

1185
01:24:45,466 --> 01:24:47,293
Bren, when do I get that
friggin' Spinal Tap thing?

1186
01:24:48,046 --> 01:24:50,623
It's called a spinal block, and
you can't have it yet, honey.

1187
01:24:50,624 --> 01:24:52,451
The doctor said you're
not dilated enough.

1188
01:24:52,919 --> 01:24:55,548
Come on! I have to wait
for it to get worse?

1189
01:24:55,549 --> 01:24:58,235
Why can't I just have
the friggin' thing now?

1190
01:24:58,920 --> 01:25:02,428
Honey, doctors are sadists who like to
play God and watch lesser people scream.

1191
01:25:03,796 --> 01:25:04,623
Oh, shit.

1192
01:25:05,325 --> 01:25:08,700
Excuse me! Can we give my kid
the damn spinal tap already?

1193
01:25:38,339 --> 01:25:39,228
And then...

1194
01:25:40,149 --> 01:25:41,540
...out of nowhere...

1195
01:25:42,784 --> 01:25:43,572
...there it was...

1196
01:25:45,272 --> 01:25:46,524
There he was.

1197
01:25:53,555 --> 01:25:55,866
I decided not to call Bleeker to
tell him that I was having the baby.

1198
01:25:56,538 --> 01:26:00,629
He had a big meet against Manteno and I
didn't want him to get all worried about me.

1199
01:26:06,427 --> 01:26:07,505
But he figured it out anyway.

1200
01:26:25,472 --> 01:26:27,131
Someday you'll be back here, honey.

1201
01:26:29,926 --> 01:26:30,959
On your terms.

1202
01:26:43,442 --> 01:26:44,520
Hey.

1203
01:26:45,284 --> 01:26:47,253
Nice legs.

1204
01:27:29,069 --> 01:27:30,725
Bleeker decided he didn't
want to see the baby.

1205
01:27:32,630 --> 01:27:35,601
Neither did I, really.
He didn't feel like ours.

1206
01:27:43,144 --> 01:27:44,819
I think he was always hers.

1207
01:27:49,598 --> 01:27:51,019
Would you like to meet your son?

1208
01:27:53,302 --> 01:27:55,255
I have a son?

1209
01:28:23,408 --> 01:28:24,224
How do I look?

1210
01:28:25,988 --> 01:28:26,832
Like a new mom.

1211
01:28:27,678 --> 01:28:28,877
Scared shitless.

1212
01:28:54,997 --> 01:28:56,452
It ended with a chair.

1213
01:29:52,958 --> 01:29:58,724
As boyfriends go, Paulie Bleeker is totally
boss. He is the cheese to my macaroni.

1214
01:30:01,117 --> 01:30:03,772
I know people are supposed to fall
in love before they reproduce, but,

1215
01:30:04,975 --> 01:30:06,584
I guess normalcy's not really our style.

1216
01:30:13,803 --> 01:30:14,506
Hey.

1217
01:30:15,020 --> 01:30:16,223
Hey.

1218
01:30:21,037 --> 01:30:21,865
Ready?

1219
01:30:22,286 --> 01:30:23,505
Yeah.

1220
01:30:34,886 --> 01:30:41,968
You're a part time lover and a full time friend
The monkey on you're back is the latest trend

1221
01:30:41,978 --> 01:30:47,968
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

1222
01:30:47,978 --> 01:30:54,968
Here is the church and here is the steeple
We sure are cute for two ugly people

1223
01:30:54,978 --> 01:31:00,968
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

1224
01:31:00,978 --> 01:31:07,968
We both have shiny happy fits of rage
You want more fans, I want more stage

1225
01:31:07,978 --> 01:31:13,968
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

1226
01:31:13,978 --> 01:31:20,968
You are always trying to keep it real
I'm in love with how you feel

1227
01:31:20,978 --> 01:31:26,968
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

1228
01:31:26,978 --> 01:31:33,968
I kiss you on the brain in the shadow of a train
I kiss you all starry eyed, my body's swinging from side to side

1229
01:31:33,978 --> 01:31:39,968
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

1230
01:31:39,978 --> 01:31:46,968
The pebbles forgive me, the trees forgive me
So why can't, you forgive me?

1231
01:31:46,978 --> 01:31:53,968
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else
But you

1232
01:31:53,978 --> 01:31:59,968
Du du du du du du dudu
Du du du du du du dudu

1233
01:31:59,978 --> 01:32:06,968
I don't see what anyone can see, in anyone else

1234
01:32:06,978 --> 01:32:08,968
But you
