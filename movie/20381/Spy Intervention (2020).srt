00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,926
At the dawn of time,

3
00:00:33,928 --> 00:00:36,929
the roles of men and women
were well-defined.

4
00:00:45,073 --> 00:00:47,140
He who lived an
adventurous life,

5
00:00:47,142 --> 00:00:49,675
hunting, foraging
and providing,

6
00:00:50,845 --> 00:00:52,945
while she stayed in thesecurity
of their cave dwelling

7
00:00:52,947 --> 00:00:54,914
and made what little
they had at home.

8
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:01,687
But over millions of years,
something strange happened:

9
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,073
the lines blurred.

10
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:06,458
Call it evolution or
straight up confusion,

11
00:01:06,461 --> 00:01:10,696
but the modern relationship
is so complicated.

12
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:14,033
Just like every other
couple throughout history,

13
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:15,701
we had plenty of
our own issues.

14
00:01:15,703 --> 00:01:17,837
While most people plan
a date night,

15
00:01:17,839 --> 00:01:20,540
see a therapist or
secretly take out

16
00:01:20,542 --> 00:01:22,208
their frustrations during sex,

17
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,944
we needed something
much more intense.

18
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:26,646
We needed an intervention.

19
00:01:28,716 --> 00:01:30,583
I guess we should start
at the beginning.

20
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:33,820
When Pam and I first met,
like every other guy,

21
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:35,822
I was just trying to scratch out
a living.

22
00:01:37,225 --> 00:01:40,660
- What about Venice?
- Nah, too cliche.

23
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:42,094
Yeah.

24
00:01:42,096 --> 00:01:43,062
Tokyo?

25
00:01:43,064 --> 00:01:47,467
You know, I don't think
Francesca eats sushi.

26
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:48,734
Yeah well,
we can't just take 'em

27
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:49,902
to New York for
dinner this month.

28
00:01:49,904 --> 00:01:50,870
That's amateur.

29
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:53,606
I don't know, they're Black Ops.

30
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:55,208
Their standards are pretty high.

31
00:01:56,744 --> 00:01:57,977
Well I'll think of somethin'.

32
00:01:57,979 --> 00:01:59,045
Yeah.

33
00:02:09,958 --> 00:02:11,657
What about Paris?

34
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:14,482
Well with everything
goin' on there,

35
00:02:14,483 --> 00:02:15,894
I don't wanna feel like
I'm on-call.

36
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:26,322
Nah, you're right.

37
00:02:26,323 --> 00:02:28,039
I'll think of somethin'
a little more exotic

38
00:02:30,144 --> 00:02:31,143
off the grid.

39
00:02:33,948 --> 00:02:37,250
You didn't see that or this.

40
00:02:39,854 --> 00:02:41,220
- I've got it.
- What?

41
00:02:41,222 --> 00:02:42,555
Kathmandu.

42
00:02:43,258 --> 00:02:45,992
Kathman-fucking-du, yes!

43
00:02:45,994 --> 00:02:47,560
The girls are gonna love
the little restaurants

44
00:02:47,562 --> 00:02:49,128
and dive bars in the Himalayas.

45
00:02:56,938 --> 00:02:59,672
The important thing is what
happens in Kathmandu,

46
00:02:59,674 --> 00:03:01,007
stays in Kathmandu.

47
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:08,681
I've got our target,

48
00:03:08,683 --> 00:03:09,749
Egan Doyle.

49
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:11,985
We don't know what
kind of weapon

50
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:14,220
he's trying to acquire
or from whom.

51
00:03:15,256 --> 00:03:17,690
He's moving quickly
through the concourse.

52
00:03:33,308 --> 00:03:34,840
I'm so sorry, are you okay?

53
00:03:34,842 --> 00:03:36,309
No no, I'm not okay.

54
00:03:38,112 --> 00:03:39,111
What?

55
00:03:44,652 --> 00:03:45,751
That really fucking hurt.

56
00:03:51,614 --> 00:03:53,269
Corey, (taps) what's goin' on?

57
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,925
I just don't know what would
make you in such a rush.

58
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:56,228
You don't have to be running
recklessly through a mall

59
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,264
without looking where
you're going.

60
00:03:58,266 --> 00:03:59,710
I mean it was rude

61
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:01,155
and I've just gotten
to a point in my life

62
00:04:01,156 --> 00:04:02,600
where I'm gonna be one of
these people that speaks up,

63
00:04:02,604 --> 00:04:04,103
so this is me speaking up.

64
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:06,639
And I'm just curious what
you might have to say

65
00:04:06,641 --> 00:04:07,940
other than you're sorry

66
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:09,240
because you've already
fucking said that.

67
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:17,149
I don't know.

68
00:04:20,021 --> 00:04:21,887
- Sorry, I overstepped.

69
00:04:23,091 --> 00:04:25,858
Here I am giving lectures
when I should just be

70
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,927
I'm handing out free samples.

71
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:29,929
What the hell are
you doin', Corey?

72
00:04:29,931 --> 00:04:32,232
Go get Egan.

73
00:04:32,233 --> 00:04:34,534
It's all about customer
appreciation

74
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,836
and I want you to know
that I appreciate you.

75
00:04:38,306 --> 00:04:39,639
I feel appreciated.

76
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:43,209
Whoa, your hands.

77
00:04:43,211 --> 00:04:46,078
They're like sandpaper.

78
00:04:47,181 --> 00:04:49,949
What, are you in construction
or something?

79
00:04:49,951 --> 00:04:51,050
What the?

80
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:54,920
No, I'm not in construction.

81
00:04:54,922 --> 00:04:57,923
I work in cardboard,
sell cardboard boxes.

82
00:05:01,062 --> 00:05:03,396
Right well if you want,

83
00:05:03,398 --> 00:05:05,031
you can join our
membership club.

84
00:05:05,033 --> 00:05:07,166
We can send you,
you know information,

85
00:05:07,168 --> 00:05:08,367
specials and coupons.

86
00:05:08,369 --> 00:05:11,103
I just need your email.

87
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:13,339
Yeah, join the club.

88
00:05:16,377 --> 00:05:17,376
Great.

89
00:05:19,881 --> 00:05:24,016
I'm Corey.

90
00:05:24,018 --> 00:05:25,017
I'm Pam.

91
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:31,090
Corey.

92
00:05:31,092 --> 00:05:32,725
Is this thing even working?

93
00:05:32,727 --> 00:05:33,726
Corey.

94
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:37,196
Corey, Corey!

95
00:05:38,065 --> 00:05:38,931
Shit, I'm sorry.

96
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:39,965
I have to go.

97
00:05:39,967 --> 00:05:41,367
Is everything okay?

98
00:05:41,369 --> 00:05:42,368
Just a business meeting.

99
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:43,836
What about your email?

100
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:46,238
Don't worry, I'll find you.

101
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:54,380
Fuck, shit.

102
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:56,315
We lost Egan.

103
00:05:58,352 --> 00:05:59,719
We lost Egan.

104
00:06:01,222 --> 00:06:02,455
What the fuck?

105
00:06:12,133 --> 00:06:15,034
Jeez, thought it was a bug.

106
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:21,874
Don't freak out, Corey's
gonna be here any minute.

107
00:06:25,213 --> 00:06:27,813
So you're looking
at Havenshire County's

108
00:06:27,815 --> 00:06:30,116
year five figure skating champion.

109
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,086
Wow, you're really good.

110
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:42,428
Oh my god.

111
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:45,898
Were you in the Olympics
or something?

112
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,933
Just a little ice
hockey growin' up.

113
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:51,804
- I knew it.
- What?

114
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:52,872
You're gonna be one
of those guys

115
00:06:52,874 --> 00:06:54,374
who's good at everything.

116
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,875
What's wrong with being good
at everything?

117
00:06:55,877 --> 00:06:57,977
Knowing you're good
at everything,

118
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:00,246
nothing will ever
make you happy.

119
00:07:00,248 --> 00:07:01,214
That's not true.

120
00:07:01,215 --> 00:07:02,181
- I'm totally happy.
- Are you?

121
00:07:02,183 --> 00:07:03,215
Yeah, I am.

122
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:07,787
You wanna know what I think?

123
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:09,522
I think you're one of those guys

124
00:07:09,523 --> 00:07:11,256
who's always gonna be
looking up at the clouds

125
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,826
tryin' to figure out
the next dream,

126
00:07:13,828 --> 00:07:16,195
the next accomplishment
trying to see

127
00:07:16,197 --> 00:07:19,265
every little part of the world
and how to escape to it

128
00:07:19,267 --> 00:07:22,101
all so you don't have to look
in the mirror

129
00:07:22,103 --> 00:07:23,936
and find out who
you really are.

130
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:29,441
Where's the adventure
in that, my dear?

131
00:07:30,878 --> 00:07:34,213
The adventure is finding out
what's really inside.

132
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,603
It's still kinda early.

133
00:07:40,604 --> 00:07:42,087
What do you feel like doin'?

134
00:07:42,089 --> 00:07:45,224
No, it's your turn.

135
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:48,327
You can't expect me to come up
with everything.

136
00:07:49,096 --> 00:07:50,262
All right, well we can hop

137
00:07:50,264 --> 00:07:52,097
a jet to New York,
catch a play.

138
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:56,068
Jump on a yacht to Tahiti.

139
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,520
Yeah.

140
00:07:57,521 --> 00:07:58,971
Or we can head to Kenya
for a safari.

141
00:07:58,973 --> 00:08:01,507
Your head, it's in the clouds.

142
00:08:01,509 --> 00:08:04,210
For a guy who sells cardboard
boxes for a living,

143
00:08:04,212 --> 00:08:06,912
you have quite the imagination.

144
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:10,149
Yeah, I guess I do.

145
00:08:13,988 --> 00:08:16,255
Look, I've gotta get up early
in the morning

146
00:08:16,257 --> 00:08:19,258
to open the store, so I think
we should call it a night.

147
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:22,328
Yeah.

148
00:08:22,329 --> 00:08:24,263
Yeah, we'll call it a rain check
on our next adventure.

149
00:08:30,538 --> 00:08:32,216
(Corey sighing)

150
00:08:32,217 --> 00:08:33,895
Look, I hope I didn't freak
you out earlier

151
00:08:33,896 --> 00:08:35,574
with my whole anti-thrill
seeking diagnosis.

152
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:40,379
There's something about you.

153
00:08:43,885 --> 00:08:45,017
There's a word for it.

154
00:08:45,019 --> 00:08:46,619
- You're just--
- Oh god, no.

155
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:49,154
No, look I've been on way
too many dates

156
00:08:49,156 --> 00:08:50,456
where people pretend.

157
00:08:50,458 --> 00:08:51,924
You know,
they're not themselves.

158
00:08:51,926 --> 00:08:53,175
It's not me.

159
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:54,425
What you see is what you get.

160
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:56,451
No, I get it.

161
00:08:56,452 --> 00:08:57,674
I'd much rather have
you be real than--

162
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:58,897
Present something I'm not?

163
00:09:01,335 --> 00:09:02,434
Right, yeah.

164
00:09:05,506 --> 00:09:07,940
I guess if you do wanna
come over, you can.

165
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,308
But I'm gonna be
watching a movie

166
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,410
and I have laundry,
like a lot of laundry.

167
00:09:11,412 --> 00:09:13,012
Stacks of it, in fact.

168
00:09:13,014 --> 00:09:14,947
Love to do laundry
and watch a movie.

169
00:09:21,455 --> 00:09:24,456
Great.

170
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:25,457
Great.

171
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:45,077
- Are you good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

172
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:46,178
You?

173
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,179
Yeah.

174
00:09:55,723 --> 00:09:56,989
- Fuck!
- What the hell

175
00:09:56,991 --> 00:09:58,057
is wrong with you?

176
00:09:58,058 --> 00:09:59,124
You're messin' me up.

177
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,191
- Coffee.
- You never miss.

178
00:10:00,194 --> 00:10:01,777
Yeah well, it must be the gun.

179
00:10:01,778 --> 00:10:03,361
You know ever since we failed
that Egan mission,

180
00:10:03,364 --> 00:10:05,498
you haven't been the same.

181
00:10:05,499 --> 00:10:07,633
All right Smuts, I failed one
fuckin' mission one time.

182
00:10:07,635 --> 00:10:09,601
It's bound to happen
sooner or later, 'kay?

183
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:11,603
Well it wouldn't have happened

184
00:10:11,604 --> 00:10:13,604
if you weren't off
flirting with Pat.

185
00:10:13,607 --> 00:10:15,407
- It's Pam.
- Whatever.

186
00:10:16,544 --> 00:10:19,345
Just tell me you're not gettin'
serious with this girl.

187
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:21,614
Trust me.

188
00:10:21,615 --> 00:10:23,115
Pam and I,
we're just havin' fun.

189
00:10:23,117 --> 00:10:24,550
There's nothin' serious about it.

190
00:10:24,552 --> 00:10:25,918
45 seconds to play

191
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:27,285
in the sudden death overtime.

192
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:35,894
Who would you do

193
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:37,261
if you could be someone
completely different?

194
00:10:37,264 --> 00:10:39,098
What do you mean?

195
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,533
Don't you ever think about
making some drastic change?

196
00:10:41,535 --> 00:10:43,635
You know, taking some risk
and chance

197
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:45,704
just to be something else.

198
00:10:46,674 --> 00:10:49,041
Oh yeah, sure.

199
00:10:49,043 --> 00:10:50,209
I mean why not buy
a three-bedroom house

200
00:10:50,211 --> 00:10:52,145
and sell boxes from one place

201
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:54,080
rather than chase corporate
accounts all over the world?

202
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:56,015
- No no no no, you have
to be something else.

203
00:10:56,017 --> 00:10:59,018
I mean like for me, I've always
always always

204
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:01,520
wanted to have
my makeup line.

205
00:11:02,423 --> 00:11:04,456
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

206
00:11:04,458 --> 00:11:06,492
I mean I can see the packaging
field the products.

207
00:11:06,494 --> 00:11:07,960
I once even worked
for the chemists

208
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:09,427
in developing this firming cream.

209
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:11,697
Firming cream,
what is firming cream?

210
00:11:11,699 --> 00:11:14,566
Oh you don't have to worry
about it, you don't need it

211
00:11:16,037 --> 00:11:17,269
yet.

212
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:19,405
All right.

213
00:11:19,407 --> 00:11:21,774
So if you got it over here,
why not do it now?

214
00:11:21,776 --> 00:11:24,076
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

215
00:11:24,078 --> 00:11:27,146
So says the cardboard
box salesman.

216
00:11:27,148 --> 00:11:28,547
Why don't you just
change your career

217
00:11:28,549 --> 00:11:30,482
and become what
you're dying to be?

218
00:11:31,585 --> 00:11:33,185
How do you know I won't?

219
00:11:36,057 --> 00:11:37,689
Well, I know.

220
00:11:37,691 --> 00:11:40,726
I mean as much as I see myself
commanding a makeup empire,

221
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:43,162
I don't wanna sacrifice
everything I have now.

222
00:11:43,164 --> 00:11:45,197
I think it'd be easier
climbing Mount Everest.

223
00:11:45,199 --> 00:11:46,165
I don't know 'bout that.

224
00:11:46,166 --> 00:11:47,132
It's pretty difficult.

225
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:49,468
I'd imagine.

226
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,636
Although, the Napelese

227
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:53,172
food is pretty good I hear.

228
00:11:55,676 --> 00:11:57,509
So how long have
you been thinking

229
00:11:57,510 --> 00:11:59,343
about that three-bedroom house
with the white picket fence?

230
00:12:02,116 --> 00:12:03,348
Ever since I met you.

231
00:12:08,355 --> 00:12:09,354
Yeah?

232
00:12:09,356 --> 00:12:11,723
I sort of had a similar thought.

233
00:12:11,725 --> 00:12:13,092
You did?

234
00:12:13,093 --> 00:12:14,460
Yeah, like this morning.

235
00:12:14,461 --> 00:12:15,828
I was at Target and I saw
this dinnerware set

236
00:12:15,830 --> 00:12:19,098
and I just suddenly thought
these would be perfect

237
00:12:19,633 --> 00:12:21,100
for our dinner parties.

238
00:12:22,103 --> 00:12:24,870
You want dinner parties?

239
00:12:24,872 --> 00:12:25,871
Corey,

240
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:33,745
we're gonna have a lot of
dinner parties.

241
00:13:02,443 --> 00:13:03,609
There you go.

242
00:13:05,412 --> 00:13:07,079
Is that all?

243
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,747
Is that gonna make me young
enough to make you the cougar?

244
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:11,150
Yeah, well

245
00:13:11,152 --> 00:13:13,152
they do come highly
recommended.

246
00:13:13,154 --> 00:13:14,386
You ever seen one of these?

247
00:13:14,388 --> 00:13:15,921
They take ya all over
the world.

248
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:17,455
You could ride the Harry
train with me there.

249
00:13:17,458 --> 00:13:18,924
Okay, maybe one day.

250
00:13:18,925 --> 00:13:20,391
Don't take me off
your boyfriend list.

251
00:13:20,392 --> 00:13:21,858
I won't.

252
00:13:21,862 --> 00:13:23,629
Cheers.

253
00:13:23,630 --> 00:13:25,397
- Have a great day.
- See ya soon.

254
00:13:25,398 --> 00:13:27,165
Bye, thank you so much.

255
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:32,404
I don't have a gag reflex
in case you were wondering.

256
00:13:35,476 --> 00:13:37,176
Here we go.

257
00:13:37,178 --> 00:13:39,945
- You are a moron.
- Mm-hmm, why?

258
00:13:39,947 --> 00:13:41,713
'Cause he had a frickin'
black card.

259
00:13:41,715 --> 00:13:43,816
So?

260
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:45,918
So that card is an
insurance policy, Pam.

261
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,653
That card says you
never have to work

262
00:13:47,655 --> 00:13:49,454
at this shitty job ever again.

263
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:51,190
That card says sorry, Brianna.

264
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:52,958
I can't make it
to your birthday party

265
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,725
because my husband and I are
vacationing in the Swiss Alps

266
00:13:54,728 --> 00:13:56,595
and then we're going
to our Italian villa

267
00:13:56,597 --> 00:13:58,330
where we're gonna be
waited on hand-and-foot

268
00:13:58,332 --> 00:14:00,365
by bronze-chested man servants.

269
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:01,867
Brianna, you know I'm in
a relationship.

270
00:14:01,869 --> 00:14:04,436
Corey sells boxes, Pam.

271
00:14:04,438 --> 00:14:05,204
Okay?

272
00:14:05,205 --> 00:14:05,971
I mean is he cute?

273
00:14:05,973 --> 00:14:06,883
Yeah.

274
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:07,794
Does his ass look good
in a pair of jeans?

275
00:14:07,795 --> 00:14:08,705
Sure.

276
00:14:08,706 --> 00:14:09,616
Does he have a
good personality?

277
00:14:09,617 --> 00:14:10,527
Why not?

278
00:14:10,528 --> 00:14:11,438
But at the end of the day,

279
00:14:11,445 --> 00:14:14,713
he sells cardboard
fucking boxes, Pam.

280
00:14:14,715 --> 00:14:15,781
Do you know how
boring that is?

281
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:17,482
It's not boring.

282
00:14:17,484 --> 00:14:19,184
Is he James Bond?

283
00:14:19,185 --> 00:14:20,885
No, but like I don't want
a James Bond.

284
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:22,888
Well good 'cause you got
James Bland.

285
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:24,623
I just want someone
I can depend on.

286
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:27,859
Someone that is stable,
like-minded, consistent.

287
00:14:27,861 --> 00:14:29,645
Well you shoulda told me
you were looking for that

288
00:14:29,646 --> 00:14:31,430
'cause I woulda hooked you
up with my grandfather.

289
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:32,497
Okay.

290
00:14:34,435 --> 00:14:35,851
Okay.

291
00:14:35,852 --> 00:14:37,268
What does he do, eat
your pussy really good?

292
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:38,904
I don't know, I don't get it.

293
00:14:38,906 --> 00:14:40,606
I can't answer that question.

294
00:14:40,608 --> 00:14:42,541
You just quit, what the hell?

295
00:14:42,543 --> 00:14:45,444
This whole spy life isn't what
I want anymore, Smuts.

296
00:14:45,446 --> 00:14:47,613
You said it yourself,
I haven't been the same

297
00:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,014
since I failed that last mission.

298
00:14:49,016 --> 00:14:50,382
It's 'cause I'm not.

299
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:52,417
God.

300
00:14:54,904 --> 00:14:57,388
Please don't start with that
romantic dribble about Pat.

301
00:14:58,592 --> 00:15:00,659
It's Pam.

302
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,727
And yes she's what I care about,
Smuts all right?

303
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,330
I love her.

304
00:15:04,331 --> 00:15:05,931
I'm ready to live
that normal life

305
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:07,532
that we've always
been protecting.

306
00:15:08,669 --> 00:15:09,668
Really?

307
00:15:10,504 --> 00:15:12,471
Wow, okay.

308
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:16,408
So you're telling me that
you can't wait to go out,

309
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:19,778
assume your cover,
sell cardboard boxes

310
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,814
be chained to a desk,
join a bowling league,

311
00:15:22,816 --> 00:15:25,484
start paying taxes,
get a mortgage,

312
00:15:25,486 --> 00:15:27,619
have a car payment,
fly commercial,

313
00:15:27,621 --> 00:15:29,688
start swimming in
credit card debt?

314
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:32,824
I mean, what are you gonna
tell me next,

315
00:15:32,826 --> 00:15:36,461
that ya like drinking
domestic beer?

316
00:15:38,966 --> 00:15:40,565
I love domestic beer.

317
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:56,515
Done.

318
00:15:59,386 --> 00:16:02,821
Holy, it's a bit of a fixer-upper.

319
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,823
Yeah, but it's ours.

320
00:16:07,777 --> 00:16:09,660
Well our boxes are made
of 100% recycled material.

321
00:16:09,663 --> 00:16:11,430
No, I can't give you a discount.

322
00:16:11,432 --> 00:16:12,765
What I can do is enroll you

323
00:16:12,766 --> 00:16:14,099
in our customer
appreciation program

324
00:16:14,101 --> 00:16:16,435
which does offer rewards
on both orders.

325
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:19,149
Well I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

326
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:20,861
But if you happen
to change your mind,

327
00:16:20,862 --> 00:16:22,573
don't hesitate to call back
and ask for cardboard Corey.

328
00:16:23,444 --> 00:16:24,843
Ooh.

329
00:16:26,113 --> 00:16:28,280
Welcome to the team.

330
00:16:28,281 --> 00:16:30,448
Well let's knock 'em down
and knock 'em back, huh?

331
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:33,952
- Honey, I'm home.
- Taste this.

332
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:36,455
Mmm, that's good; what is it?

333
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:38,107
Nepalese Momo.

334
00:16:38,108 --> 00:16:39,758
I found them in this amazing
cookbook that I picked up

335
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:41,260
this week and I couldn't find
the Jimbu,

336
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:42,761
but I think this'll taste all right.

337
00:16:42,763 --> 00:16:44,207
A what?

338
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:45,652
It's a Nepalese dried onion.

339
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:47,097
I'm testin' for our dinner party.

340
00:16:47,101 --> 00:16:48,033
What dinner party?

341
00:16:48,035 --> 00:16:49,034
- Corey.
- What?

342
00:16:49,036 --> 00:16:53,605
We're gonna have a lot of
dinner parties.

343
00:16:56,944 --> 00:17:00,045
God, I hope it stays
like this forever.

344
00:17:07,388 --> 00:17:10,389
And for the cave people,
it did stay like that forever.

345
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:16,828
But unfortunately, well
we ain't livin' in a cave.

346
00:17:20,934 --> 00:17:22,701
I thought you were gonna
call and have that fixed.

347
00:17:22,703 --> 00:17:27,839
I thought you were gonna
call and have that fixed.

348
00:17:33,881 --> 00:17:36,648
No, we don't have
any plastic bins.

349
00:17:36,650 --> 00:17:38,600
We don't have any
metal containers.

350
00:17:38,601 --> 00:17:40,551
We don't sell steel drums,
just boxes.

351
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:44,956
Plain old fucking
cardboard boxes.

352
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:48,560
It's all about personality.

353
00:17:51,598 --> 00:17:52,964
It's all about passion.

354
00:17:55,436 --> 00:17:57,536
It's all about believing
what you sell.

355
00:18:00,574 --> 00:18:02,974
Look I don't know what you
want me to do here, Rick.

356
00:18:02,976 --> 00:18:05,043
All right?

357
00:18:05,044 --> 00:18:07,111
I watched the training video,
I followed the sales manual.

358
00:18:07,112 --> 00:18:09,179
At the end of the day, I mean
they're just boxes.

359
00:18:11,518 --> 00:18:12,517
No, Corey.

360
00:18:14,621 --> 00:18:16,588
They're not just boxes.

361
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:19,624
These are containers that move
the treasures of our lives.

362
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:23,728
Right, okay.

363
00:18:24,598 --> 00:18:25,730
Remember our motto,

364
00:18:28,735 --> 00:18:30,235
"Think outside the box."

365
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:36,858
Hey, Freddy.

366
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:37,808
C'mon baby, let's go.

367
00:18:37,811 --> 00:18:38,721
You got this.

368
00:18:38,722 --> 00:18:39,632
Four pins, that's all we need.

369
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:40,543
C'mon.

370
00:18:44,852 --> 00:18:45,817
- Loser!
- Woo!

371
00:18:54,127 --> 00:18:56,661
Hey, what the fuck?

372
00:18:56,663 --> 00:18:58,163
First we lose to Polly's Pies,

373
00:18:58,165 --> 00:19:00,665
then Tim's Auto Body
and now Diana's Floral?

374
00:19:01,235 --> 00:19:02,067
I mean what is this?

375
00:19:02,069 --> 00:19:04,052
I don't get it.

376
00:19:04,053 --> 00:19:06,036
Do you even realize that
we are the laughing stock

377
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:07,205
of this league?

378
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:10,509
Every time you throw a gutter
or miss a spare,

379
00:19:10,511 --> 00:19:12,878
you guys just laugh if
off and it's not funny.

380
00:19:13,881 --> 00:19:15,647
I mean I've tried to help
you guys, right?

381
00:19:15,649 --> 00:19:17,549
I mean Ted,
I bought you finger grips.

382
00:19:17,551 --> 00:19:18,817
Where the hell they at?

383
00:19:19,953 --> 00:19:22,521
Fred, I bought you lessons.

384
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:24,039
Bob.

385
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:25,556
Bob you know if anybody
was on my side,

386
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,676
I thought it'd be you.

387
00:19:27,677 --> 00:19:29,794
I bought you a wrist guard
and you don't even wear it.

388
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,800
- Well why don't you quit?
- No.

389
00:19:35,802 --> 00:19:37,636
Winners don't quit, Ted.

390
00:19:37,638 --> 00:19:39,271
Winners win.

391
00:19:39,272 --> 00:19:40,905
I honestly don't give
a shit about winning.

392
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:42,591
Yeah, man.

393
00:19:42,592 --> 00:19:44,275
Do you know how much shit
I have to deal with at home?

394
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:46,611
I don't need extra pressure,
I don't want stress.

395
00:19:46,613 --> 00:19:49,247
I come here to drink beers
and catch up with my guys.

396
00:19:51,585 --> 00:19:53,251
Hey, I forgot to tell you guys.

397
00:19:53,253 --> 00:19:55,153
My dual hood grill
just showed up.

398
00:19:55,923 --> 00:19:56,955
It's incredible.

399
00:19:58,258 --> 00:20:01,960
Oh man,
I am so jealous right now.

400
00:20:30,991 --> 00:20:33,124
I'm kinda tired.

401
00:20:33,126 --> 00:20:35,727
Yeah, I'm kinda tired too.

402
00:20:36,296 --> 00:20:37,829
Maybe tomorrow.

403
00:20:38,765 --> 00:20:40,732
Definitely tomorrow.

404
00:20:44,271 --> 00:20:46,037
Wow, you were totally right.

405
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:48,373
This definitely beats happy hour.

406
00:20:48,375 --> 00:20:50,241
You know serial killers
hang out here, right?

407
00:20:50,243 --> 00:20:51,943
Okay look,
you didn't have to come.

408
00:20:51,945 --> 00:20:54,145
I told you I had to get
the track lighting.

409
00:20:55,282 --> 00:20:56,815
Listen to yourself.

410
00:20:56,817 --> 00:20:58,083
You've been on like
this Joan of Arc,

411
00:20:58,084 --> 00:20:59,350
mother of misery routine
for a week.

412
00:20:59,353 --> 00:21:01,153
Here we go.

413
00:21:01,154 --> 00:21:02,954
I'm just saying I get why
you're depressed.

414
00:21:02,955 --> 00:21:04,755
You get up, go to work,
you come home.

415
00:21:04,758 --> 00:21:07,325
You watch "Dance
Mom" for 12 hours,

416
00:21:07,327 --> 00:21:09,294
then you pass out and do it
all over again.

417
00:21:09,296 --> 00:21:11,163
It's enough to make
anybody miserable.

418
00:21:11,164 --> 00:21:13,031
If I lied to you and told you
I was miserable,

419
00:21:13,033 --> 00:21:14,086
would that make you stop?

420
00:21:14,087 --> 00:21:15,140
I don't want you to be miserable.

421
00:21:15,141 --> 00:21:16,194
I just want you to be that Pam

422
00:21:16,195 --> 00:21:17,248
that I used to know,
you know?

423
00:21:17,249 --> 00:21:18,302
The Pam who was like it's
four p.m., who cares?

424
00:21:18,305 --> 00:21:21,806
Let's go get drunk or let's go
on a crazy shopping spree

425
00:21:21,808 --> 00:21:23,908
even though we both have no
money in our bank accounts.

426
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:27,012
The Pam that just had
that like joie de vivre.

427
00:21:27,014 --> 00:21:29,214
Brianna, I am happy.

428
00:21:29,216 --> 00:21:30,449
Look,
you just don't understand

429
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,683
what it's like to be
in a relationship.

430
00:21:31,685 --> 00:21:33,869
There's a lot going on.

431
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,054
Corey and I've gotta you know
finish stuff with the house.

432
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:38,923
We're decorating rooms,
refinishing hardwood,

433
00:21:38,925 --> 00:21:40,659
installing track lighting.

434
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:43,862
It's a lot.

435
00:21:43,863 --> 00:21:45,863
You know, there's just not
enough time for joie de vivre.

436
00:21:45,866 --> 00:21:47,966
Okay, well we better make
some time for margaritas

437
00:21:47,968 --> 00:21:49,668
'cause this bitch is craving.

438
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:50,669
Okay.

439
00:21:50,671 --> 00:21:52,354
I wish you would've
married James Bond

440
00:21:52,355 --> 00:21:54,038
instead of James Bland.

441
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:55,006
James Bond?

442
00:21:55,008 --> 00:21:57,175
James Bond, really?

443
00:21:57,176 --> 00:21:59,343
'Cause he was an emotionally
unstable womanizing alcoholic.

444
00:21:59,346 --> 00:22:01,079
Yeah, but that's kinda hot.

445
00:22:01,915 --> 00:22:05,450
Wow, this place is amazing.

446
00:22:05,452 --> 00:22:08,019
How come we've never
hung out here before?

447
00:22:08,021 --> 00:22:09,721
You're not funny.

448
00:22:09,723 --> 00:22:11,545
You're wrong.

449
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:13,368
You see I'm Rodney fuckin'
Dangerfield, man.

450
00:22:13,369 --> 00:22:15,191
I'm tellin' you comedy is tragedy
and this place

451
00:22:16,096 --> 00:22:17,662
is fucking depressing.

452
00:22:17,663 --> 00:22:19,229
I warned you I had to pick up
a light package, right?

453
00:22:19,232 --> 00:22:20,632
You knew what you
were gettin' into.

454
00:22:20,633 --> 00:22:22,033
Yeah, you warned me all right

455
00:22:22,035 --> 00:22:24,769
and all this really excites you.

456
00:22:24,771 --> 00:22:27,238
Yes, this really excites me.

457
00:22:28,108 --> 00:22:31,242
Damn, you need a vacation.

458
00:22:31,244 --> 00:22:32,243
What?

459
00:22:32,245 --> 00:22:33,979
A vacation.

460
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,714
A place you can swim
with dolphins,

461
00:22:35,716 --> 00:22:39,751
squirrel suit off a cliff,
hovercraft over a lake.

462
00:22:39,753 --> 00:22:42,721
I don't know, just anything
to feel your mojo

463
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:47,859
that's so obviously been neutered
by this suburban insanity.

464
00:22:49,129 --> 00:22:50,729
Yeah well, I'd love to go
to some tropical destination

465
00:22:50,731 --> 00:22:52,864
with warm sunshine
and cold drinks, Smuts.

466
00:22:52,866 --> 00:22:54,332
But what problems does
that solve?

467
00:22:59,306 --> 00:23:01,323
Hello.

468
00:23:03,343 --> 00:23:04,776
What the hell, I'm here now.

469
00:23:06,179 --> 00:23:07,312
Well why would you have me
come here

470
00:23:07,314 --> 00:23:09,314
if you were gonna get it?

471
00:23:11,351 --> 00:23:12,417
Okay.

472
00:23:14,955 --> 00:23:17,889
You really do have
a lotta problems.

473
00:23:18,525 --> 00:23:19,858
Spy means nothin'.

474
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:23,528
Yeah well,
you're not a spy anymore.

475
00:23:26,215 --> 00:23:27,898
I feel like we should take
a trip somewhere,

476
00:23:27,901 --> 00:23:28,767
get outta here.

477
00:23:28,769 --> 00:23:30,135
Go where?

478
00:23:30,137 --> 00:23:31,436
I don't know, anywhere.

479
00:23:32,272 --> 00:23:36,074
England, France, Nepal.

480
00:23:36,076 --> 00:23:37,426
- Cool.
- Yeah,

481
00:23:37,427 --> 00:23:38,777
instead of reading
and tryin' to replicate,

482
00:23:38,779 --> 00:23:40,462
you know let's go.

483
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:42,146
Boots on the ground, taste
the food, see Mount Everest.

484
00:23:42,149 --> 00:23:44,149
Just escape.

485
00:23:45,152 --> 00:23:47,852
I've always wanted
to see Mount Everest.

486
00:23:47,854 --> 00:23:49,487
Could cash in some
airline miles,

487
00:23:49,489 --> 00:23:51,456
go for a week,
just enough time to recharge.

488
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,191
- Refresh.
- Invigorate.

489
00:23:54,194 --> 00:23:56,528
Just forget about all our
troubles, you know?

490
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,495
What troubles?

491
00:23:59,499 --> 00:24:01,566
Not troubles, just stresses.

492
00:24:03,136 --> 00:24:04,969
Life's little crosses
we all have to bear.

493
00:24:04,971 --> 00:24:06,588
Yeah?

494
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:08,206
But we agreed that we'd spend
money on the house

495
00:24:08,208 --> 00:24:10,575
instead of carelessly
dropping out on vacations.

496
00:24:10,577 --> 00:24:12,310
I mean for instance,

497
00:24:12,311 --> 00:24:14,044
we still have to install
the track lighting.

498
00:24:15,081 --> 00:24:17,549
Yeah, but do we really
want the track lighting?

499
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:19,818
Of course we want
the track lighting.

500
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,053
It's part of the lighting
package that we picked out.

501
00:24:22,055 --> 00:24:23,855
And if we don't have that,

502
00:24:23,857 --> 00:24:25,390
what is the point of
having this island

503
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:27,275
in the kitchen without
the island?

504
00:24:27,276 --> 00:24:29,159
Where are we gonna put the stools
that we had pre-ordered?

505
00:24:29,162 --> 00:24:31,596
Without stools, where's
everyone gonna congregate

506
00:24:31,598 --> 00:24:32,839
at the dinner party?

507
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,081
What dinner party?

508
00:24:34,082 --> 00:24:35,323
- Corey.
- What?

509
00:24:35,324 --> 00:24:36,565
We're gonna have a lot of
dinner parties.

510
00:24:36,570 --> 00:24:37,569
We are?

511
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:40,038
Yeah.

512
00:25:12,405 --> 00:25:14,539
What the hell is this?

513
00:25:15,475 --> 00:25:19,377
This is an intervention.

514
00:25:19,379 --> 00:25:20,979
Hi, Corey.

515
00:25:22,115 --> 00:25:24,015
An intervention.

516
00:25:24,017 --> 00:25:26,517
What the fuck do I need an
intervention for, Smuts?

517
00:25:26,519 --> 00:25:29,354
Listen man, we know
you're miserable.

518
00:25:29,356 --> 00:25:30,405
Miserable?

519
00:25:30,406 --> 00:25:31,455
No, I am not miserable.

520
00:25:31,458 --> 00:25:33,024
My life is great.

521
00:25:33,026 --> 00:25:34,225
We've been watching.

522
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:36,461
Your life sucks.

523
00:25:36,463 --> 00:25:38,096
You've been spying on me.

524
00:25:38,098 --> 00:25:39,030
We're spies.

525
00:25:39,032 --> 00:25:40,098
That's what we do.

526
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:41,132
Oh my god.

527
00:25:41,134 --> 00:25:42,934
We wouldn't be true spies

528
00:25:42,936 --> 00:25:45,403
if we allowed you to waste away
like this.

529
00:25:45,405 --> 00:25:47,372
Yeah,
so you decided to shoot me.

530
00:25:47,374 --> 00:25:48,640
Great.

531
00:25:48,641 --> 00:25:49,907
I had to test the new tranq gun.

532
00:25:54,047 --> 00:25:55,213
Who the hell is this?

533
00:25:55,215 --> 00:25:57,282
Remora aka Suckerfish.

534
00:25:57,284 --> 00:25:59,167
Smuts gave me
the code name.

535
00:25:59,168 --> 00:26:01,051
After you left, he brought me
into handle the grunt work

536
00:26:01,054 --> 00:26:02,137
he didn't wanna do.

537
00:26:02,138 --> 00:26:03,221
Isn't that right, Smuts?

538
00:26:04,391 --> 00:26:06,324
Yeah, thanks.

539
00:26:08,695 --> 00:26:10,595
I mean he's
my minion basically.

540
00:26:12,165 --> 00:26:14,966
As much as I appreciate
being dragged

541
00:26:14,968 --> 00:26:17,335
all the way down here
and told my life sucks,

542
00:26:18,138 --> 00:26:19,404
you're wrong.

543
00:26:19,406 --> 00:26:21,039
I love my life.

544
00:26:21,041 --> 00:26:22,674
I love that I get to wake up
every morning,

545
00:26:22,676 --> 00:26:24,342
go to work and come home.

546
00:26:24,344 --> 00:26:25,610
No chance of being shot.

547
00:26:25,612 --> 00:26:27,078
No chance of being blown up.

548
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:28,730
Now call me crazy,

549
00:26:28,731 --> 00:26:30,381
but the change is actually
quite refreshing.

550
00:26:35,355 --> 00:26:36,454
Really?

551
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:39,557
Corey, this is a safe place.

552
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,776
Why do you keep
talking like that?

553
00:26:41,777 --> 00:26:43,994
Corey, Smuts and I wanted
to create a circle of trust

554
00:26:43,997 --> 00:26:45,196
so you felt comfortable.

555
00:26:45,198 --> 00:26:46,164
Corey,

556
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:50,234
there's somebody
we'd like you to meet.

557
00:26:50,236 --> 00:26:52,637
Oh, fantastic.

558
00:26:52,639 --> 00:26:54,973
Fine, but then I'm leaving.

559
00:26:56,409 --> 00:26:58,343
Okay, thank you.

560
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:14,392
Corey,
my name is Dr. Studebaker

561
00:27:14,394 --> 00:27:15,994
and I have been doing
some analysis

562
00:27:15,996 --> 00:27:19,397
on the field research
I was provided.

563
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:20,999
I prepared a few images.

564
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:24,369
Frustration,

565
00:27:26,306 --> 00:27:27,305
anger.

566
00:27:30,276 --> 00:27:30,925
Big one.

567
00:27:30,926 --> 00:27:31,575
Denial

568
00:27:34,414 --> 00:27:36,247
and finally, acceptance.

569
00:27:39,686 --> 00:27:42,687
Bravo, Smuts.

570
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:44,655
You put a few pictures together,
what's the point?

571
00:27:44,657 --> 00:27:47,358
My point is the reason you
can't settle into suburban life

572
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:49,127
has nothing to do
with the life itself.

573
00:27:49,129 --> 00:27:51,029
Oh, well
I can maintain an erection

574
00:27:51,031 --> 00:27:52,163
if that's what you're gettin' at.

575
00:27:52,165 --> 00:27:54,032
I know, we have the slides.

576
00:27:56,036 --> 00:27:58,036
Corey,
you have unfinished business.

577
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:00,638
What the hell are
you talkin' about?

578
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,707
You failed your last mission

579
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:05,710
and rather than face your
failure, what did you do?

580
00:28:05,712 --> 00:28:07,078
You ran away.

581
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:10,348
I believe that failure's causing
these strong emotions

582
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:12,350
of frustration in your present life

583
00:28:13,353 --> 00:28:16,187
and until you succeed
at a final mission,

584
00:28:16,756 --> 00:28:18,222
you won't be able
to settle into

585
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:20,425
a peaceful and
tranquil existence.

586
00:28:23,463 --> 00:28:25,329
Well, thank you very,
very much

587
00:28:25,331 --> 00:28:26,831
for the psychobabble bullshit.

588
00:28:26,833 --> 00:28:28,299
But trust me when I tell you

589
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:30,635
my life is perfectly fine, okay?

590
00:28:32,072 --> 00:28:33,471
And the last thing I need is
to chase some lunatic

591
00:28:33,473 --> 00:28:35,073
half way across the globe.

592
00:28:35,075 --> 00:28:37,508
You know,
you wouldn't have to go far.

593
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:38,609
The mission's here.

594
00:28:39,612 --> 00:28:40,611
Egan's back.

595
00:28:43,249 --> 00:28:44,766
Great.

596
00:28:44,767 --> 00:28:46,284
Then you won't have to go far
to get him, will ya?

597
00:28:46,286 --> 00:28:48,152
Egan recently got married

598
00:28:48,154 --> 00:28:51,422
and is mysteriously
honeymooning here.

599
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:54,759
We believe he's tryin' to acquire
plans for a weapon

600
00:28:54,761 --> 00:28:56,227
from a local sell.

601
00:29:05,572 --> 00:29:08,606
We've arranged for you to come
back for this one mission.

602
00:29:09,642 --> 00:29:11,442
You start tomorrow.

603
00:29:14,414 --> 00:29:17,215
What the hell don't
you understand, Smuts?

604
00:29:17,217 --> 00:29:18,649
I'm just not interested, okay?

605
00:29:18,651 --> 00:29:20,485
Corey, they're only doing this

606
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:21,853
because they care about you.

607
00:29:21,855 --> 00:29:23,321
They want to help.

608
00:29:23,323 --> 00:29:25,757
I don't need their help

609
00:29:25,758 --> 00:29:28,192
and I damn sure don't need
this fucking intervention.

610
00:29:28,194 --> 00:29:29,193
Okay.

611
00:30:02,295 --> 00:30:04,295
Lemme guess,

612
00:30:04,297 --> 00:30:06,164
the shrink was right and
you're only doing this

613
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:08,399
so you can settle down
in your married life?

614
00:30:08,401 --> 00:30:09,834
I hate you.

615
00:30:09,836 --> 00:30:10,902
Welcome back.

616
00:30:14,374 --> 00:30:17,441
Egan's set to arrive
Friday before noon.

617
00:30:17,443 --> 00:30:21,212
He'll be stayin' in a suite
at the Pines Hotel

618
00:30:21,214 --> 00:30:24,182
and unlike your perfect marriage,

619
00:30:24,184 --> 00:30:26,317
we're convinced his is a cover.

620
00:30:26,319 --> 00:30:27,752
So what's our strategy?

621
00:30:27,754 --> 00:30:29,720
You're to mirror his every move.

622
00:30:29,722 --> 00:30:32,557
You've come in town
for your honeymoon

623
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:34,592
and will be stayin'
in adjacent suite

624
00:30:34,594 --> 00:30:35,960
with one of our field agents

625
00:30:35,962 --> 00:30:37,595
who's gonna pretend
to be your wife.

626
00:30:37,597 --> 00:30:39,597
Hold on, hold on.

627
00:30:39,598 --> 00:30:41,598
You want me to pretend to be
married to someone else?

628
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:43,251
Yeah.

629
00:30:43,252 --> 00:30:44,902
This is the best you guys

630
00:30:44,904 --> 00:30:46,370
could come up with?

631
00:30:46,372 --> 00:30:49,941
Wow you didn't drag me all
the way down here for this

632
00:30:49,943 --> 00:30:50,908
did you, Smuts?

633
00:30:52,545 --> 00:30:54,212
Smuts has had me
prepare the research

634
00:30:54,214 --> 00:30:56,431
and all of our modeling confirms

635
00:30:56,432 --> 00:30:58,649
that pretending to be married
gives us the greatest access.

636
00:31:00,486 --> 00:31:02,470
Relax, Corey.

637
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:04,455
You can still clip coupons,
trim hedges

638
00:31:04,457 --> 00:31:07,225
and come home
to Pam every night.

639
00:31:07,227 --> 00:31:10,261
I just need you to bond
with Egan and his Mrs.

640
00:31:10,263 --> 00:31:14,899
and get the plans for a weapon
that could wipe us all out.

641
00:31:14,901 --> 00:31:17,435
We don't know what it is.

642
00:31:17,436 --> 00:31:19,970
It could be a laser,
it could be an atom bomb.

643
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:21,873
I don't know.

644
00:31:21,874 --> 00:31:23,774
I just know that
lives are at risk!

645
00:31:23,776 --> 00:31:26,811
Are you willing to have
blood on your hands

646
00:31:26,813 --> 00:31:29,714
because you're married
all of a sudden?!

647
00:31:32,685 --> 00:31:34,318
That's on you, brother.

648
00:31:37,257 --> 00:31:40,041
All right.

649
00:31:40,042 --> 00:31:42,826
Fine I'll do it, but I'm only
doin' it for Pat.

650
00:31:46,633 --> 00:31:49,700
Once you befriend
Egan and his new bride,

651
00:31:49,702 --> 00:31:52,670
you should be close
enough to use this.

652
00:32:11,524 --> 00:32:13,557
Smuts told me to play around
in a lab for a few weeks

653
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,693
and I came up with this.

654
00:32:15,695 --> 00:32:17,295
It's actually a visual lie detector.

655
00:32:17,297 --> 00:32:18,179
See these buttons?

656
00:32:18,180 --> 00:32:19,062
Itty-bitty cameras.

657
00:32:19,065 --> 00:32:20,598
When you speak
directly to Egan,

658
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:22,289
it'll scan his face,

659
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,979
send that information
back to these monitors

660
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:25,669
where we can determine
if he's lying or not.

661
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:27,538
And we're sure this works.

662
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:30,875
Corey, you ever think
about leaving Pam?

663
00:32:30,877 --> 00:32:33,511
No, absolutely not.

664
00:32:35,448 --> 00:32:36,447
It works.

665
00:32:36,449 --> 00:32:40,351
Let's make sure to fully
weaponize Corey's house

666
00:32:40,353 --> 00:32:42,937
for his own protection.

667
00:32:42,938 --> 00:32:45,522
Oh and since you're back, we'll
go ahead and pick up the tab

668
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,992
on your domestic beers.

669
00:32:57,870 --> 00:32:59,570
Smuts, I'm on-site.

670
00:32:59,572 --> 00:33:00,832
The preventative
security measures

671
00:33:00,833 --> 00:33:02,093
are ready to be installed.

672
00:33:02,094 --> 00:33:03,354
You can count on me.

673
00:33:03,355 --> 00:33:04,615
I'm takin' care of business,
doing it by the book:

674
00:33:04,616 --> 00:33:05,876
tackling objectives,
checking boxes.

675
00:33:08,381 --> 00:33:09,380
Smuts?

676
00:33:11,117 --> 00:33:12,416
Where the hell is Corey?

677
00:33:13,052 --> 00:33:15,336
He wanted me to tell you

678
00:33:15,337 --> 00:33:17,621
that he has set up several
off-site meetings

679
00:33:17,623 --> 00:33:20,758
with potential buyers and that
you should be proud of him

680
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,893
because he's thinkin'
outside of the box.

681
00:33:23,996 --> 00:33:25,746
All right, get back to work.

682
00:33:25,747 --> 00:33:27,497
A-B-C, always be cardboarding.

683
00:33:30,903 --> 00:33:32,737
Here's your key.

684
00:33:32,738 --> 00:33:34,572
Agent Panzant's
waiting for you inside.

685
00:33:34,574 --> 00:33:36,440
I hear she's hot.

686
00:33:36,442 --> 00:33:38,576
What's your point?

687
00:33:38,577 --> 00:33:40,711
My point is it's your job
to hook up with her.

688
00:33:40,713 --> 00:33:42,780
I'm married, remember?

689
00:33:42,782 --> 00:33:45,716
I'm only doin' this to get
Egan, find closure.

690
00:33:45,718 --> 00:33:47,017
Uh-huh.

691
00:33:47,019 --> 00:33:48,519
Trust me.

692
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:50,020
Once this is over, it's gonna
take my relationship

693
00:33:50,021 --> 00:33:51,521
to a whole other level, all right?

694
00:33:51,524 --> 00:33:52,523
Sure.

695
00:33:53,659 --> 00:33:54,859
Whoa hey, hold up.

696
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:56,794
You're not comin' in?

697
00:33:56,796 --> 00:33:57,995
Why would I do that?

698
00:33:57,997 --> 00:34:01,532
I don't know, we just always
worked together.

699
00:34:02,101 --> 00:34:03,100
Right.

700
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:06,737
Oh my gosh.

701
00:34:07,507 --> 00:34:10,074
Oh my gosh!

702
00:34:11,511 --> 00:34:13,811
You're afraid to be alone
in a room with a hot girl.

703
00:34:13,813 --> 00:34:17,715
What, are you afraid you're
gonna give into the temptations

704
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:18,883
on the other side of that door?

705
00:34:18,885 --> 00:34:20,351
All right, all right.

706
00:34:20,352 --> 00:34:21,818
Like a real therapy session

707
00:34:21,821 --> 00:34:24,488
where you're just takin' out
your daily aggressions.

708
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:26,774
- Is that how you do it?
- Then when it's all done,

709
00:34:26,775 --> 00:34:29,059
you guys just lay in like a kiddie
pool of your own sweat

710
00:34:29,061 --> 00:34:33,697
in the middle of the bed
exhausted, but feelin' good.

711
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:35,699
Secret is safe with me, dude.

712
00:34:36,702 --> 00:34:37,968
Spy's honor.

713
00:34:40,473 --> 00:34:41,639
You're an idiot.

714
00:34:48,014 --> 00:34:49,330
I hope you don't mind.

715
00:34:49,331 --> 00:34:50,647
I'm a sort of a method spy.

716
00:34:52,652 --> 00:34:54,185
Method spy, huh?

717
00:34:54,186 --> 00:34:55,719
You know,
like a method actress.

718
00:34:56,489 --> 00:34:58,122
I have to live it to be it.

719
00:34:58,124 --> 00:35:00,508
- Right.
- And to be honest,

720
00:35:00,509 --> 00:35:02,893
our whole relationship,
our marriage,

721
00:35:05,865 --> 00:35:07,932
I'm just not really feeling it.

722
00:35:07,934 --> 00:35:12,102
- Feeling what?
- Us, together as a couple.

723
00:35:12,104 --> 00:35:13,604
I mean, think about it.

724
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:15,072
Would someone like me
ever actually

725
00:35:15,074 --> 00:35:16,540
be attracted to someone
like you?

726
00:35:16,542 --> 00:35:18,108
Oh okay, I see.

727
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,944
Then how do you know
someone like me

728
00:35:19,945 --> 00:35:21,779
would be attracted
to someone like you?

729
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,216
'Cause you look married.

730
00:35:28,888 --> 00:35:31,189
Okay.

731
00:35:31,190 --> 00:35:33,491
♪ Please don't give up on me ♪

732
00:35:33,493 --> 00:35:35,192
♪ I know that ♪

733
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,800
Where are you?

734
00:35:41,801 --> 00:35:43,101
Is everything okay?

735
00:35:43,102 --> 00:35:44,402
Everything's fine.

736
00:35:44,403 --> 00:35:45,703
Everything's fine.

737
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:47,004
I got a ton of work to do
so don't wait up, okay?

738
00:36:17,537 --> 00:36:19,003
This is much better.

739
00:36:19,005 --> 00:36:22,740
I'm not agreeing, but
I'm not disagreeing.

740
00:36:22,742 --> 00:36:24,475
I totally think we should be
one of those couples

741
00:36:24,476 --> 00:36:26,209
who just can't keep their
hands off each other.

742
00:36:27,613 --> 00:36:29,747
See you at nine tomorrow.

743
00:36:29,749 --> 00:36:31,882
Yeah, see you at nine.

744
00:36:33,953 --> 00:36:34,952
Smuts, fill me in.

745
00:36:34,954 --> 00:36:35,920
Gimme the details.

746
00:36:35,921 --> 00:36:36,887
What's the skinny?

747
00:36:38,291 --> 00:36:41,091
I had to buy 50k
in boxes from Corey,

748
00:36:41,093 --> 00:36:43,327
so his boss wouldn't
get suspicious.

749
00:36:43,329 --> 00:36:44,645
Got it.

750
00:36:44,646 --> 00:36:45,962
Did you consider spacing
out the deliveries

751
00:36:45,965 --> 00:36:47,197
to make it look more legitimate?

752
00:36:47,199 --> 00:36:48,566
Just an idea.

753
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:50,200
You wanna grab a beer
after this?

754
00:36:52,972 --> 00:36:53,971
Smuts?

755
00:36:56,976 --> 00:36:59,310
- Corey?
- You're still up.

756
00:36:59,312 --> 00:37:00,844
Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

757
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:05,199
What?!

758
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,249
What, what's goin' on?

759
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:08,919
Your hair.

760
00:37:11,924 --> 00:37:14,124
Oh yeah, got it cut.

761
00:37:14,126 --> 00:37:16,126
Just thought a little
style couldn't hurt.

762
00:37:16,128 --> 00:37:18,195
But it's kinda ridiculous.

763
00:37:19,699 --> 00:37:21,465
All right, so maybe she went
a little overboard.

764
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:23,232
I don't see why you have
to freak out about it.

765
00:37:23,235 --> 00:37:24,101
I'm not freaking out.

766
00:37:24,103 --> 00:37:25,336
A little bit.

767
00:37:25,338 --> 00:37:26,793
Okay, I am.

768
00:37:26,794 --> 00:37:28,249
But if I suddenly came home

769
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:29,705
with some weird and crazy
hairdo, you'd freak out too.

770
00:37:29,709 --> 00:37:31,431
You did.

771
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:33,154
You cut your hair short.

772
00:37:33,155 --> 00:37:34,877
Okay wait, you're saying
you don't like my hair?

773
00:37:35,781 --> 00:37:37,314
What?

774
00:37:37,315 --> 00:37:38,848
When I came home with it cut,
you said you loved my hair.

775
00:37:38,849 --> 00:37:40,382
What was I supposed
to say, Pam?

776
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:41,916
Wow honey,
did you just join the Marines?

777
00:37:42,722 --> 00:37:44,021
Oh okay, I'm sorry.

778
00:37:44,022 --> 00:37:45,321
I didn't realize that
our relationship

779
00:37:45,324 --> 00:37:48,392
was one based on looks alone.

780
00:37:48,394 --> 00:37:49,293
You know what I'm tryin' to say.

781
00:37:49,295 --> 00:37:50,628
No, I don't.

782
00:37:52,632 --> 00:37:54,298
Something else
you haven't told me yet?

783
00:37:55,301 --> 00:37:57,301
No.

784
00:37:58,304 --> 00:38:00,037
What is going on?!

785
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,205
What's goin' on?

786
00:38:01,207 --> 00:38:02,773
What's wrong?

787
00:38:02,775 --> 00:38:04,074
Your chest.

788
00:38:06,379 --> 00:38:08,912
Oh yeah, I used a little men's
hair body removal cream.

789
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:10,347
- What's the big deal?
- Oh my god.

790
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:12,282
- What?
- Nothing, it's just

791
00:38:14,887 --> 00:38:16,954
you call me to tell me
that you're working late

792
00:38:16,956 --> 00:38:20,357
and little did I know that you
were on your way to the spa,

793
00:38:20,359 --> 00:38:22,326
turning yourself
into a metrosexual.

794
00:38:27,066 --> 00:38:30,134
Everything just seems a little bit
suspicious, that's all.

795
00:38:31,370 --> 00:38:33,070
Nothing is going on

796
00:38:33,071 --> 00:38:34,771
that needs to make
you suspicious, okay?

797
00:38:55,194 --> 00:38:56,293
What was that?

798
00:38:58,097 --> 00:39:00,264
Just somethin' else
I'm gonna have to fix.

799
00:39:04,937 --> 00:39:06,086
Oh god, it's not happening.

800
00:39:06,087 --> 00:39:07,236
It can't be happening.

801
00:39:08,007 --> 00:39:09,056
Oh, it's happening.

802
00:39:09,057 --> 00:39:10,106
He's having an affair.

803
00:39:11,977 --> 00:39:13,977
Well fuckin' duh, dude.

804
00:39:13,979 --> 00:39:15,496
God, it'd be so much easier

805
00:39:15,497 --> 00:39:17,014
if his ass didn't look
so good in jeans.

806
00:39:17,016 --> 00:39:18,716
I mean,
where the fuck did it go wrong?

807
00:39:18,718 --> 00:39:20,017
Where did it go wrong?

808
00:39:20,019 --> 00:39:21,369
I mean come on,
look at the guy.

809
00:39:21,370 --> 00:39:22,720
He sells fuckin'
boxes for a living.

810
00:39:22,722 --> 00:39:24,063
He's desperate.

811
00:39:24,064 --> 00:39:25,405
Of course he's gonna fall
for some firm ass model

812
00:39:25,406 --> 00:39:26,747
who lives for alcohol
and orgasms.

813
00:39:26,748 --> 00:39:28,089
He probably shocked
he could get her.

814
00:39:28,094 --> 00:39:29,477
I mean, I was shocked.

815
00:39:29,478 --> 00:39:30,861
Come on, can you believe it?

816
00:39:32,732 --> 00:39:34,131
But what should I do?

817
00:39:35,301 --> 00:39:36,934
You know,
do I steal his phone?

818
00:39:36,936 --> 00:39:38,091
Yes.

819
00:39:38,092 --> 00:39:39,247
- Hack into his email?
- Fuck yeah.

820
00:39:39,248 --> 00:39:40,403
I can't just spy on the guy.

821
00:39:40,406 --> 00:39:41,772
Oh, yes you can.

822
00:39:42,808 --> 00:39:43,474
Really?

823
00:39:43,476 --> 00:39:44,408
But I can't.

824
00:39:44,409 --> 00:39:45,341
- You can.
- I shouldn't.

825
00:39:45,344 --> 00:39:46,544
You should.

826
00:39:46,545 --> 00:39:47,745
What am I even talking about?

827
00:39:47,746 --> 00:39:48,946
I'm driving myself crazy.

828
00:39:48,948 --> 00:39:50,564
It's okay.

829
00:39:50,565 --> 00:39:52,181
It's okay to go crazy 'cause
he's a dick, okay?

830
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:54,017
And dicks make bitches crazy.

831
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:56,987
Look at me,
you need to spy on him.

832
00:39:56,989 --> 00:39:58,422
That way you can catch him
in the motel,

833
00:39:58,424 --> 00:39:59,890
you can kick down the door

834
00:39:59,891 --> 00:40:01,357
and kick that collegiate
nympho to the curb.

835
00:40:01,358 --> 00:40:02,824
I'll be there and I'll be
videotaping everything.

836
00:40:02,825 --> 00:40:04,291
We'll put it on YouTube,
we'll get a ton of views.

837
00:40:04,296 --> 00:40:05,295
It'll be great.

838
00:40:17,843 --> 00:40:19,443
The sound's drivin' me wild.

839
00:40:21,347 --> 00:40:23,046
Are we really gonna sit here

840
00:40:23,048 --> 00:40:24,848
and listen to this shit all day?

841
00:40:26,519 --> 00:40:30,821
Trust me, I've done a lotta
sex stakeouts in my day.

842
00:40:30,823 --> 00:40:32,289
Either Egan's a really
good spy

843
00:40:32,291 --> 00:40:34,892
or homeboy's really fuckin'.

844
00:40:43,402 --> 00:40:44,434
- Get the camera.
- Excuse me.

845
00:40:44,436 --> 00:40:46,270
Told you I'm method.

846
00:40:46,272 --> 00:40:48,172
My character's in the mood.

847
00:40:48,173 --> 00:40:50,073
All right, I am not method
and my character--

848
00:40:51,277 --> 00:40:53,110
Actually this is a really
bad angle for you.

849
00:40:53,112 --> 00:40:55,512
Can you just crane your neck
to left a little bit?

850
00:40:55,514 --> 00:40:56,864
What the hell are you doin'?

851
00:40:56,865 --> 00:40:58,215
- Huh?
- You better not be gentle.

852
00:40:58,217 --> 00:41:00,150
C'mon, man.

853
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:02,084
This is for my Christmas
party blooper reel.

854
00:41:02,087 --> 00:41:04,221
Remember that footage I got
of you and Graciela

855
00:41:04,223 --> 00:41:05,276
from two years ago?

856
00:41:05,277 --> 00:41:06,330
Smuts, how many times
do I have to tell you

857
00:41:06,331 --> 00:41:07,384
that I am fuckin' married?

858
00:41:07,385 --> 00:41:08,438
Personally,
I think open relationships

859
00:41:08,439 --> 00:41:09,492
are quite progressive.

860
00:41:09,495 --> 00:41:12,963
Wow you're a real freak,
aren't you?

861
00:41:12,965 --> 00:41:15,132
Just shut up and point
the camera, all right?

862
00:41:15,134 --> 00:41:17,234
Now if you could just get
a little closer,

863
00:41:17,236 --> 00:41:18,969
make it feel real.

864
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:21,872
Hello?

865
00:41:21,874 --> 00:41:23,407
Hey, baby.

866
00:41:23,408 --> 00:41:24,941
No no no, we'll never use
any of this wife stuff.

867
00:41:24,944 --> 00:41:25,976
It's not that kind of a movie.

868
00:41:25,978 --> 00:41:27,645
What am I up to?

869
00:41:27,646 --> 00:41:29,313
Just bangin' lots of boxes.

870
00:41:29,315 --> 00:41:30,581
There we go.

871
00:41:30,582 --> 00:41:31,848
No no no no, do not do that.

872
00:41:31,851 --> 00:41:33,429
Do not do that.

873
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:35,008
I will do it in 15 minutes
and I'll be there.

874
00:41:35,009 --> 00:41:36,587
Just bring it down
a little bit please.

875
00:41:36,589 --> 00:41:38,188
Okay, bye.

876
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,391
Listen as much fun as this is,
I have to go.

877
00:41:41,393 --> 00:41:42,526
- Now?
- Now?

878
00:41:42,528 --> 00:41:43,778
Yeah, now.

879
00:41:43,779 --> 00:41:45,029
You're the one who told me

880
00:41:45,030 --> 00:41:46,280
not to let Pam get
suspicious, remember?

881
00:41:46,281 --> 00:41:47,531
You totally killed it.

882
00:41:47,533 --> 00:41:48,899
Well Smuts can fill in.

883
00:41:48,901 --> 00:41:49,967
Have a blast.

884
00:41:49,969 --> 00:41:50,985
You can't leave.

885
00:41:50,986 --> 00:41:52,002
We're in the middle
of a mission.

886
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:53,270
So am I.

887
00:41:53,272 --> 00:41:55,272
It's called savin' my marriage.

888
00:41:55,274 --> 00:41:59,276
Sound like a mission
impossible, right?

889
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:20,330
What, that's stainless.

890
00:42:20,332 --> 00:42:22,165
Thought we talked about
brushed nickel.

891
00:42:22,167 --> 00:42:24,902
Oh, well we changed our mind.

892
00:42:26,038 --> 00:42:28,305
But the brushed nickel
goes with the vanity hangers.

893
00:42:28,307 --> 00:42:30,507
Yeah, I'm changing
the vanity hangers.

894
00:42:30,509 --> 00:42:33,043
So then what's the purpose
of me being here, Pam?

895
00:42:33,045 --> 00:42:34,444
I wanted your input.

896
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:04,708
Get here.

897
00:43:08,047 --> 00:43:10,197
Where's the gun?

898
00:43:10,198 --> 00:43:12,348
Where is it?!

899
00:43:23,262 --> 00:43:25,362
- What the hell was that?
- What?

900
00:43:25,364 --> 00:43:27,431
Nothing, gonna be fine.

901
00:43:30,035 --> 00:43:32,502
Corey, you just had
a guy in a headlock.

902
00:43:32,504 --> 00:43:34,571
You know it's better to be safe
than sorry, right?

903
00:43:34,573 --> 00:43:36,306
I mean,
imagine if someone we knew

904
00:43:36,308 --> 00:43:38,075
had seen you acting like that.

905
00:43:39,861 --> 00:43:41,644
Never would've come to one
of our dinner parties.

906
00:43:41,647 --> 00:43:43,180
What dinner parties?

907
00:43:45,985 --> 00:43:47,351
Hey, Rick.

908
00:43:47,353 --> 00:43:49,753
Corey, get your ass
in the office now.

909
00:43:49,755 --> 00:43:51,488
Okay, I'm on my way.

910
00:43:52,691 --> 00:43:55,392
I gotta get back to the office,
I'll see you then?

911
00:43:55,394 --> 00:43:56,360
Sure.

912
00:43:59,665 --> 00:44:01,131
Nice hair.

913
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:02,165
Nice clothes.

914
00:44:04,003 --> 00:44:05,435
Nice ass.

915
00:44:05,437 --> 00:44:07,404
You wanted to see me
there, Rick?

916
00:44:10,676 --> 00:44:13,010
Cardboard Corey's back.

917
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,413
He is.

918
00:44:16,415 --> 00:44:17,748
Goin' to Pines Hotel.

919
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:20,150
Three days, two nights,
all-expense paid.

920
00:44:21,086 --> 00:44:22,152
Boy, the Pines.

921
00:44:23,022 --> 00:44:24,755
I don't know what to say.

922
00:44:24,757 --> 00:44:26,289
You think you're shocked.

923
00:44:26,291 --> 00:44:27,708
I couldn't believe it

924
00:44:27,709 --> 00:44:29,126
when that 10,000 box
order came through.

925
00:44:29,128 --> 00:44:31,211
10,000.

926
00:44:31,212 --> 00:44:33,295
You broke the company
record, broke my record.

927
00:44:34,299 --> 00:44:36,433
You damn near broke
the world record.

928
00:44:36,435 --> 00:44:38,068
How'd you do it?

929
00:44:38,070 --> 00:44:39,603
Oh you know, Rick.

930
00:44:39,605 --> 00:44:41,588
I just took your advice

931
00:44:41,589 --> 00:44:43,572
and thought outside the box.

932
00:44:43,575 --> 00:44:46,343
Mm-hmm, well you're not
gettin' off that easy.

933
00:44:47,112 --> 00:44:48,567
I'm not?

934
00:44:48,568 --> 00:44:50,023
Starting today, I'm gonna have
the rest of the guys

935
00:44:50,024 --> 00:44:51,479
follow us to your meetings.

936
00:44:51,483 --> 00:44:53,550
You know, see how a real
professional does it.

937
00:44:53,552 --> 00:44:54,718
Wow Rick, you know.

938
00:44:56,288 --> 00:44:57,738
I don't want the other guys
to know.

939
00:44:57,739 --> 00:44:59,189
You know I like to work alone.

940
00:44:59,191 --> 00:45:00,457
Just me, you know?

941
00:45:00,458 --> 00:45:01,724
It helps me kinda focus in.

942
00:45:02,728 --> 00:45:04,528
Takes teamwork to make
a dream work.

943
00:45:07,366 --> 00:45:09,099
You did watch tape two, right?

944
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:12,536
Yeah.

945
00:45:14,572 --> 00:45:16,605
Hey Corey,
congrats on that hotel thing.

946
00:45:16,608 --> 00:45:18,091
Yeah thanks a lot, Bob.

947
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:19,575
I thought I was gonna
win this year.

948
00:45:19,578 --> 00:45:22,212
But 10,000 boxes, huh?

949
00:45:25,217 --> 00:45:26,594
That's somethin'.

950
00:45:26,595 --> 00:45:27,972
Trust me, it's nothin'.

951
00:45:27,973 --> 00:45:29,350
Yeah, but I don't need
a five-star suite.

952
00:45:29,354 --> 00:45:32,189
Just another place my wife
wouldn't have sex with me.

953
00:45:33,725 --> 00:45:35,258
Okay, yeah.

954
00:45:35,260 --> 00:45:36,560
We'll see you tonight.

955
00:45:37,463 --> 00:45:39,362
- Tonight?
- Bowling, remember?

956
00:45:39,364 --> 00:45:40,697
Got the tournament,
Diana's Floral.

957
00:45:40,699 --> 00:45:41,565
Shit.

958
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:42,666
Yeah, right.

959
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:43,766
Of course,
I'll see you guys there.

960
00:45:46,772 --> 00:45:48,872
I told you to be here at 6:03.

961
00:45:48,874 --> 00:45:51,374
It's 6:10,
where the hell were you?

962
00:45:51,376 --> 00:45:52,709
Oh I'm sorry, Smuts.

963
00:45:52,711 --> 00:45:54,644
Before your little intervention,

964
00:45:54,646 --> 00:45:57,647
I had something called a life
that I had to deal with.

965
00:45:57,649 --> 00:45:59,516
I always just called it pitiful.

966
00:45:59,518 --> 00:46:00,784
How tight are these?

967
00:46:03,355 --> 00:46:05,005
Well it's funny you say that

968
00:46:05,006 --> 00:46:06,656
because this whole time I've
been dealin' with the fact

969
00:46:06,658 --> 00:46:11,795
that you bought 10,000
boxes from me in one day.

970
00:46:13,232 --> 00:46:14,298
What happened to the fact that
I told you to space it out,

971
00:46:14,299 --> 00:46:15,365
you know make it look legit?

972
00:46:15,367 --> 00:46:16,767
What'd you expect me to do,

973
00:46:16,768 --> 00:46:18,168
go in and fill out
a form every day?

974
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,302
I'm not gonna waste my time.

975
00:46:19,304 --> 00:46:20,804
I've got things to do.

976
00:46:20,806 --> 00:46:22,456
Things to do.

977
00:46:22,457 --> 00:46:24,107
Oh, that's great.

978
00:46:24,108 --> 00:46:25,758
Well just so you know
thanks to you,

979
00:46:25,759 --> 00:46:27,409
now I'm dealing with heat
from home, heat from work.

980
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:28,678
Actually, I'm in heat.

981
00:46:30,649 --> 00:46:31,648
Is that odd?

982
00:46:36,288 --> 00:46:38,822
- Actually, I'm in heat.
- Yes.

983
00:46:40,159 --> 00:46:41,792
Goddammit.

984
00:46:41,793 --> 00:46:43,426
All right,
let's get our head in the game.

985
00:46:43,428 --> 00:46:46,696
Claudia and Egan's restaurant
reservation is for seven p.m.

986
00:46:48,667 --> 00:46:50,667
How come your suit fits?

987
00:46:50,669 --> 00:46:51,868
Oh, thank you.

988
00:46:55,841 --> 00:46:59,576
He is not even going
to recognize you.

989
00:47:09,354 --> 00:47:11,288
Brianna, I look like a hooker.

990
00:47:11,290 --> 00:47:12,722
I'm supposed
to be undercover,

991
00:47:12,724 --> 00:47:14,791
not auditioning for strip clubs.

992
00:47:16,828 --> 00:47:19,829
Look, every year when I wanted
to start my own business,

993
00:47:19,831 --> 00:47:23,266
I would go out and buy something
smart, sophisticated.

994
00:47:23,268 --> 00:47:26,203
Something that says
I mean business.

995
00:47:27,339 --> 00:47:28,505
So this is me.

996
00:47:28,507 --> 00:47:31,875
I'm finally saying
I mean business.

997
00:47:31,877 --> 00:47:33,777
I love it.

998
00:47:33,778 --> 00:47:35,678
You just need to hire my lip girl
and you're done.

999
00:47:36,648 --> 00:47:38,481
God, who am I kidding?

1000
00:47:38,483 --> 00:47:39,416
I can't do this.

1001
00:47:39,417 --> 00:47:40,350
I don't want to do this.

1002
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:42,886
This is not who I am.

1003
00:47:42,888 --> 00:47:45,722
Pam, you listen to me, okay?

1004
00:47:45,724 --> 00:47:47,824
You need to reclaim yourself.

1005
00:47:47,826 --> 00:47:50,627
You are a sexy, wild bitch.

1006
00:47:52,364 --> 00:47:54,464
That would be embarrassing.

1007
00:47:54,466 --> 00:47:57,000
Some risks aren't worth taking.

1008
00:48:01,873 --> 00:48:03,373
You see 'em?

1009
00:48:03,375 --> 00:48:04,641
Oh you mean the sexy couple

1010
00:48:04,642 --> 00:48:05,908
that's actually having
a good time?

1011
00:48:14,253 --> 00:48:15,436
- Vodka, meat.
- Club soda.

1012
00:48:15,437 --> 00:48:16,620
He'll have a martini.

1013
00:48:16,622 --> 00:48:18,788
- Club soda.
- Straight up with a twist.

1014
00:48:21,627 --> 00:48:23,793
What are you doin'?

1015
00:48:23,795 --> 00:48:25,312
What are you doing?

1016
00:48:25,313 --> 00:48:26,830
You know, you should be
believable as my husband.

1017
00:48:26,832 --> 00:48:28,582
Believable?

1018
00:48:28,583 --> 00:48:30,333
Let's not forget I'm the one
who's married here.

1019
00:48:30,335 --> 00:48:32,046
Oh please.

1020
00:48:32,047 --> 00:48:33,758
Another big night for you
at home

1021
00:48:33,759 --> 00:48:35,470
is probably watching reruns
and eating leftovers,

1022
00:48:35,474 --> 00:48:36,840
but our marriage is not stuck

1023
00:48:36,842 --> 00:48:38,508
on opposite sides of the bed.

1024
00:48:38,510 --> 00:48:40,010
Oh trust me, darling.

1025
00:48:40,011 --> 00:48:41,511
My marriage happens
all over the bed.

1026
00:48:45,751 --> 00:48:46,750
Thank you.

1027
00:48:47,886 --> 00:48:48,885
Cheers.

1028
00:48:54,693 --> 00:48:55,959
Okay, big picture.

1029
00:48:55,961 --> 00:48:57,360
We need to connect
with Egan,

1030
00:48:57,362 --> 00:48:58,962
so you need to connect
with me.

1031
00:48:58,964 --> 00:49:01,031
So drink up, look at me
like you wanna fuck me

1032
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:03,333
and check your baggage
with the bellhop.

1033
00:49:04,336 --> 00:49:06,003
What baggage?

1034
00:49:06,004 --> 00:49:07,671
What do you mean,
what baggage?

1035
00:49:07,672 --> 00:49:09,339
Remember Corey,
this is your intervention.

1036
00:49:10,575 --> 00:49:12,509
You knew about that.

1037
00:49:18,317 --> 00:49:19,649
Has anyone considered
they might actually

1038
00:49:19,651 --> 00:49:21,451
just be here
on their honeymoon?

1039
00:49:23,955 --> 00:49:25,822
No chance.

1040
00:49:25,823 --> 00:49:27,690
Everything they do is
too connected, forced.

1041
00:49:29,861 --> 00:49:32,729
Trust me, that's not
what married people do.

1042
00:49:33,465 --> 00:49:34,464
Ooh.

1043
00:49:46,878 --> 00:49:48,378
What are you doin'?

1044
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,379
What?

1045
00:49:51,016 --> 00:49:52,349
Should I stop?

1046
00:49:55,420 --> 00:49:58,988
Is it bad?

1047
00:49:58,990 --> 00:49:59,989
Huh?

1048
00:50:02,060 --> 00:50:05,662
Is it not
what married people do?

1049
00:50:05,664 --> 00:50:08,865
Alex, sit down.

1050
00:50:08,867 --> 00:50:10,467
Why?

1051
00:50:10,469 --> 00:50:12,769
Because you're
drawing attention.

1052
00:50:12,771 --> 00:50:13,870
- Really?
- Yeah.

1053
00:50:14,639 --> 00:50:15,872
Who's looking at me?

1054
00:50:17,743 --> 00:50:19,042
Are the waiters watching?

1055
00:50:19,845 --> 00:50:21,111
What about Egan?

1056
00:50:22,647 --> 00:50:23,947
Is he watching?

1057
00:50:25,417 --> 00:50:27,150
What about you?

1058
00:50:27,152 --> 00:50:28,918
Are you watching?

1059
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:30,520
You're gonna blow this.

1060
00:50:30,522 --> 00:50:31,521
Oh, you.

1061
00:51:37,189 --> 00:51:39,523
Get up.

1062
00:52:45,891 --> 00:52:47,457
I'm sorry,
I borrowed your husband,

1063
00:52:47,458 --> 00:52:49,024
but this place was a little dead.

1064
00:52:49,961 --> 00:52:51,186
Are you kidding?

1065
00:52:51,187 --> 00:52:52,412
That was the most fun,
we've had on our honeymoon.

1066
00:52:52,413 --> 00:52:53,638
Wait,
you're on your honeymoon?

1067
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:54,864
We're on our honeymoon.

1068
00:52:54,866 --> 00:52:56,199
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1069
00:52:56,201 --> 00:52:59,202
- Shut up.
- Oh, I love you.

1070
00:52:59,204 --> 00:53:01,704
Hopefully we'll see you guys
some more.

1071
00:53:01,706 --> 00:53:04,207
Well we're gonna be hanging
by the pool tomorrow.

1072
00:53:04,209 --> 00:53:05,842
Just drop on by.

1073
00:53:05,844 --> 00:53:07,210
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1074
00:53:07,211 --> 00:53:08,577
I hope you don't mind
if we turn in.

1075
00:53:08,578 --> 00:53:09,944
I just got super tired.

1076
00:53:13,685 --> 00:53:14,684
Bye.

1077
00:53:19,824 --> 00:53:22,825
Okay, so now we have a pool
date with them tomorrow.

1078
00:53:22,827 --> 00:53:25,128
I guess you convinced
them you wanna fuck me.

1079
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:28,865
Shit, I gotta go.

1080
00:53:28,867 --> 00:53:30,633
Go where?!

1081
00:53:30,635 --> 00:53:34,037
- Bowling tournament.
- Pfft.

1082
00:53:36,241 --> 00:53:38,741
You guys shoulda seen
this Home & Garden Show.

1083
00:53:38,743 --> 00:53:40,643
Took up the entire Civic Center.

1084
00:53:40,645 --> 00:53:44,981
I mean they had pools, tubs,
lawn care, everything.

1085
00:53:44,983 --> 00:53:46,816
I even won a raffle.

1086
00:53:46,818 --> 00:53:48,117
What'd you win?

1087
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:50,653
Leaf blower, a good one too.

1088
00:53:50,655 --> 00:53:52,255
- Nice.
- No shit.

1089
00:53:52,256 --> 00:53:53,856
You're excited about
a leaf blower, Bob?

1090
00:53:54,659 --> 00:53:56,326
And you'll be too.

1091
00:53:56,327 --> 00:53:57,994
Come fall all those
trees in your yard,

1092
00:53:57,996 --> 00:54:00,263
you're gonna be beggin'
me to borrow it.

1093
00:54:00,265 --> 00:54:03,166
No, I just mean
there's gotta be more

1094
00:54:03,168 --> 00:54:05,234
to get excited about, right?

1095
00:54:05,236 --> 00:54:07,904
Leaf blowers and goddamn
home shows, is that it?

1096
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:10,607
It's an acquired appreciation.

1097
00:54:11,610 --> 00:54:14,711
Look, all I'm sayin' is
you guys even notice

1098
00:54:14,713 --> 00:54:16,913
that all we ever talk
about is the yard

1099
00:54:16,915 --> 00:54:19,849
or adding a deck or
buying a new grill?

1100
00:54:21,252 --> 00:54:23,269
There's got to be more to life

1101
00:54:23,270 --> 00:54:25,287
than the fuckin' hardware store,
am I right?

1102
00:54:27,959 --> 00:54:29,409
No, not really.

1103
00:54:29,410 --> 00:54:30,860
The only thing that
excited me last year

1104
00:54:30,862 --> 00:54:32,996
was when I put a kegerator
in my garage.

1105
00:54:32,998 --> 00:54:34,364
That was awesome.

1106
00:54:37,636 --> 00:54:40,803
So you're tellin' me that
this is all there is to life?

1107
00:54:40,805 --> 00:54:44,073
What we're livin' right here,
right now, this is it?

1108
00:54:45,076 --> 00:54:46,909
Yeah, how hard is it?

1109
00:54:46,911 --> 00:54:48,628
You get married.

1110
00:54:48,629 --> 00:54:50,346
You watch each other go
to complete hell.

1111
00:54:50,348 --> 00:54:53,049
Have a kid maybe two,
stop having sex.

1112
00:54:53,051 --> 00:54:55,351
Save for retirement, get
the golden handshake.

1113
00:54:55,353 --> 00:54:57,387
Play golf on the weekends.

1114
00:54:57,388 --> 00:54:59,422
Take a dick pill, realize
that was a mistake.

1115
00:54:59,424 --> 00:55:01,357
Pick out where you want
your ashes scattered,

1116
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,894
leave everything to the kids
and hopefully you know,

1117
00:55:04,896 --> 00:55:07,130
a lotta people show up
at your funeral.

1118
00:55:07,132 --> 00:55:09,032
I'll come to your funeral, Fred.

1119
00:55:09,801 --> 00:55:12,018
Thanks, Ted.

1120
00:55:12,019 --> 00:55:14,236
Corey, it's not like there's
some grand adventure

1121
00:55:14,239 --> 00:55:16,139
out there waiting for us.

1122
00:55:18,710 --> 00:55:21,110
We're just livin' life
like everyone else.

1123
00:55:22,347 --> 00:55:24,080
And you guys are
okay with that?

1124
00:55:27,452 --> 00:55:28,818
Yeah.

1125
00:55:29,421 --> 00:55:30,820
Aren't you?

1126
00:55:33,758 --> 00:55:35,692
Yeah, 'course I am.

1127
00:55:48,039 --> 00:55:49,105
You're home late.

1128
00:55:49,974 --> 00:55:50,973
I had bowling.

1129
00:55:52,043 --> 00:55:53,042
Really?

1130
00:55:53,044 --> 00:55:54,744
Then why were there
two messages

1131
00:55:54,745 --> 00:55:56,445
from the guys wondering
where you were?

1132
00:55:56,446 --> 00:55:58,146
Well I showed up late
'cause I had to work late.

1133
00:55:58,149 --> 00:55:59,382
Big day at the office.

1134
00:55:59,384 --> 00:56:02,252
Another one?

1135
00:56:02,253 --> 00:56:05,121
Actually, I won the all-expense
paid resorts vcation.

1136
00:56:08,727 --> 00:56:10,193
Well then let's go.

1137
00:56:10,195 --> 00:56:11,994
Wait, you wanna go?

1138
00:56:11,996 --> 00:56:14,197
Yes, let's go this weekend.

1139
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:15,965
No, I can't.

1140
00:56:15,967 --> 00:56:17,366
You can't what?

1141
00:56:17,368 --> 00:56:18,935
You were the one
that wanted to take

1142
00:56:18,936 --> 00:56:20,503
a spur-of-the-moment trip,
why not do it?

1143
00:56:22,741 --> 00:56:23,890
Because I can't, Pam.

1144
00:56:23,891 --> 00:56:25,040
You know, all right?

1145
00:56:25,041 --> 00:56:26,190
I mean plus, I thought
we were gonna do stuff

1146
00:56:26,191 --> 00:56:27,340
- around the house.
- Like what?

1147
00:56:28,213 --> 00:56:30,379
Track lighting.

1148
00:56:30,381 --> 00:56:32,014
Are you mocking me?

1149
00:56:33,384 --> 00:56:34,484
Are you mocking me?

1150
00:56:35,286 --> 00:56:36,285
Are you drunk?

1151
00:56:37,522 --> 00:56:39,639
I'm not drunk, Pam.

1152
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:41,757
I had a few martinis
and a couple of beers.

1153
00:56:42,994 --> 00:56:44,510
- What's gotten into you?
- What's gotten into you?

1154
00:56:44,511 --> 00:56:46,027
I just wanna do
something different.

1155
00:56:46,030 --> 00:56:47,864
And I just wanna lay
on the couch.

1156
00:56:47,866 --> 00:56:49,031
Fine.

1157
00:56:49,033 --> 00:56:50,366
Fine.

1158
00:56:53,772 --> 00:56:54,804
What was that for?

1159
00:56:54,806 --> 00:56:55,872
The couch.

1160
00:56:55,874 --> 00:56:56,873
Goodnight.

1161
00:57:10,822 --> 00:57:14,524
Blissfully committed
to their simple routine,

1162
00:57:14,526 --> 00:57:17,393
the cave people never felt
the need to seek excitement

1163
00:57:17,395 --> 00:57:19,028
from the outside world.

1164
00:57:20,932 --> 00:57:24,333
Unfortunately for us,
well that outside world

1165
00:57:24,335 --> 00:57:27,470
was quickly unraveling
any sense of routine.

1166
00:57:33,077 --> 00:57:34,310
Morning.

1167
00:57:38,483 --> 00:57:40,416
Morning.

1168
00:57:44,422 --> 00:57:46,823
Operation: Catch
Corey is back on.

1169
00:57:53,498 --> 00:57:54,781
Rick says we're all goin'

1170
00:57:54,782 --> 00:57:56,065
on a sales call together.

1171
00:57:58,136 --> 00:57:59,969
Yeah,
lemme just confirm everything

1172
00:57:59,971 --> 00:58:01,838
and we'll get on outta here.

1173
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:02,839
Alrighty.

1174
00:58:15,386 --> 00:58:17,520
Oh, that little sneak.

1175
00:58:43,381 --> 00:58:45,348
My god,
do you ever wear clothes?

1176
00:58:45,350 --> 00:58:46,850
Excuse me,
what you're seeing here

1177
00:58:46,851 --> 00:58:48,351
is top-of-the-line tactical gear.

1178
00:58:48,353 --> 00:58:50,586
This spy-kini she's wearing
is completely bulletproof,

1179
00:58:50,588 --> 00:58:52,622
fireproof and waterproof.

1180
00:58:52,623 --> 00:58:54,657
My character sees your
character wearing this.

1181
00:58:56,594 --> 00:58:58,628
Oh I assumed you're small.

1182
00:59:01,666 --> 00:59:04,300
You're tellin' me these
can stop a bullet.

1183
00:59:04,302 --> 00:59:05,568
Sure.

1184
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:06,886
Don't get shot.

1185
00:59:06,887 --> 00:59:08,203
They're waiting down
by the pool.

1186
00:59:08,206 --> 00:59:09,305
Yeah, I'm not wearing these.

1187
00:59:09,307 --> 00:59:10,673
You're gonna have to.

1188
00:59:10,674 --> 00:59:12,040
They've already stitched
the cameras in.

1189
00:59:12,043 --> 00:59:13,042
Where?

1190
00:59:18,383 --> 00:59:20,449
Here, just put it on.

1191
00:59:24,122 --> 00:59:26,689
All right, I'll put 'em on.

1192
00:59:28,526 --> 00:59:30,393
But I'm not doin' it for you guys,

1193
00:59:31,596 --> 00:59:33,996
I'm gonna do it
for the mission, for Pam.

1194
01:00:00,959 --> 01:00:03,292
Oh hey, how are you guys?

1195
01:00:09,033 --> 01:00:10,166
I've got a visual.

1196
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:15,504
I just feel so stupid.

1197
01:00:15,506 --> 01:00:18,140
I mean, here I am following
my own husband

1198
01:00:18,142 --> 01:00:19,508
into a fucking
honeymoon suite.

1199
01:00:19,510 --> 01:00:20,977
Oh my god,
he's a frickin' polygamist.

1200
01:00:20,979 --> 01:00:22,295
I knew it.

1201
01:00:22,296 --> 01:00:23,612
Everybody watches a couple
episodes of "Big Love"

1202
01:00:23,613 --> 01:00:24,929
and then they think they can do
whatever they want.

1203
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:26,246
Sorry honey, we're closed.

1204
01:00:26,250 --> 01:00:27,116
Oh my god, there they are.

1205
01:00:28,619 --> 01:00:31,687
Oh it would just be so much
easier if she's a mess,

1206
01:00:31,689 --> 01:00:33,178
- but she's--
- Pam.

1207
01:00:33,179 --> 01:00:34,668
I do not even wanna hear
what she looks like

1208
01:00:34,669 --> 01:00:36,158
because there is
no way in hell

1209
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:37,660
that she's prettier than you.

1210
01:00:38,997 --> 01:00:40,547
All right,
tell me what she looks like.

1211
01:00:40,548 --> 01:00:42,098
Like some femme
fatale Bond villain

1212
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,033
that just graduated from
Harvard with a degree

1213
01:00:44,035 --> 01:00:45,334
in you know fucking up my life.

1214
01:00:45,336 --> 01:00:46,469
Stop.

1215
01:00:46,471 --> 01:00:47,759
You have to take
the reins here.

1216
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:49,048
You're his wife, okay?

1217
01:00:49,049 --> 01:00:50,337
You cannot let this
other woman win.

1218
01:00:57,482 --> 01:00:59,682
Hey when you got it,
you flaunt it right?

1219
01:01:04,689 --> 01:01:06,589
When we first decided
to honeymoon here,

1220
01:01:06,591 --> 01:01:09,291
so many people were like,
"Well that's different,

1221
01:01:10,294 --> 01:01:12,128
"but it's just so beautiful here."

1222
01:01:14,298 --> 01:01:17,133
I know, I had never been
to upstate New York before.

1223
01:01:17,135 --> 01:01:19,168
But the moment he proposed,

1224
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:21,437
he insisted he had
to honeymoon here.

1225
01:01:22,774 --> 01:01:24,407
I'm at a total loss.

1226
01:01:24,408 --> 01:01:26,041
This is not the man
that I married.

1227
01:01:26,044 --> 01:01:27,443
You need to go confront him.

1228
01:01:27,445 --> 01:01:28,644
- I can't.
- You can.

1229
01:01:28,646 --> 01:01:30,012
What do you want me to do?

1230
01:01:30,013 --> 01:01:31,379
You want me to drive up there?

1231
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,746
I'll drive up there and I will
cut Corey's dick off.

1232
01:01:32,747 --> 01:01:34,113
I will Lorena Bobbitt
that motherfucker.

1233
01:01:34,118 --> 01:01:36,152
I will take his dick and I will
throw it in the forest

1234
01:01:36,154 --> 01:01:37,320
and a little squirrel will pick it up

1235
01:01:37,321 --> 01:01:38,487
and run away and
put it in its nest

1236
01:01:38,489 --> 01:01:39,655
and he'll never have it again.

1237
01:01:39,657 --> 01:01:40,523
He'll be dickless.

1238
01:01:40,525 --> 01:01:41,841
Brianna.

1239
01:01:41,842 --> 01:01:43,158
I can cut his nuts off
if that's better.

1240
01:01:43,159 --> 01:01:44,475
If the dick's too much,

1241
01:01:44,476 --> 01:01:45,792
you know I can always
take the balls.

1242
01:01:45,797 --> 01:01:47,308
My grandma used to do it
with the hens all the time.

1243
01:01:47,309 --> 01:01:48,820
Look, no one's nuts
are being cut off.

1244
01:01:48,821 --> 01:01:50,332
Well, then you need
to go confront him.

1245
01:01:53,438 --> 01:01:56,305
So, why did you decide to
honeymoon in Glens Falls?

1246
01:01:56,307 --> 01:01:57,740
We've been jet-setting
around the world

1247
01:01:57,742 --> 01:02:00,810
for the last two years
straight for business,

1248
01:02:00,812 --> 01:02:04,113
so we wanted something
quaint and charming,

1249
01:02:04,115 --> 01:02:07,249
a bit out of the way, off-the-grid.

1250
01:02:11,489 --> 01:02:12,989
How 'bout you guys?

1251
01:02:12,990 --> 01:02:14,490
What made you select
a place off-the-grid?

1252
01:02:15,693 --> 01:02:16,692
-Same.

1253
01:02:16,694 --> 01:02:19,762
Off-the-grid's the desired
honeymoon destination,

1254
01:02:19,764 --> 01:02:21,163
am I right?

1255
01:02:41,152 --> 01:02:42,485
You know service
is kinda slow here.

1256
01:02:42,487 --> 01:02:43,820
I think I'm gonna go
order from the bar.

1257
01:02:43,821 --> 01:02:45,154
Do you guys want anything?

1258
01:02:45,155 --> 01:02:46,488
Why don't we split a decent
bottle of champagne?

1259
01:02:47,658 --> 01:02:48,657
Great idea.

1260
01:02:50,194 --> 01:02:51,393
Little birdie's on the move.

1261
01:02:52,330 --> 01:02:54,230
That's my birdie.

1262
01:02:58,636 --> 01:03:00,269
You have something I need.

1263
01:03:24,162 --> 01:03:24,727
Shit.

1264
01:03:24,728 --> 01:03:25,293
What happened?

1265
01:03:28,633 --> 01:03:29,698
Can you help me?

1266
01:03:36,707 --> 01:03:37,640
- Almost got it.
- All right, all right.

1267
01:03:37,642 --> 01:03:38,707
That's fine.

1268
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:39,909
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1269
01:03:46,184 --> 01:03:47,716
Honey, you're sweating.

1270
01:03:47,718 --> 01:03:49,268
Why don't you take
a dip and cool off?

1271
01:03:49,269 --> 01:03:50,819
And you should reapply
the sunscreen, sweetheart.

1272
01:03:50,821 --> 01:03:52,621
You're startin' to burn.

1273
01:03:52,623 --> 01:03:53,622
Fine.

1274
01:03:57,662 --> 01:03:58,861
All right, Corey, play it off.

1275
01:03:58,863 --> 01:04:00,763
Don't let Egan suspect anything.

1276
01:04:11,709 --> 01:04:16,845
Mmm, feels so good.

1277
01:04:20,851 --> 01:04:23,786
Do you wanna grab a beer
or something after this?

1278
01:04:23,788 --> 01:04:25,588
How many times do
I have to tell you?

1279
01:04:26,490 --> 01:04:27,723
I don't wanna hang.

1280
01:04:27,725 --> 01:04:29,592
I don't wanna grab a beer.

1281
01:04:29,593 --> 01:04:31,460
We're not gonna watch
the game together.

1282
01:04:31,462 --> 01:04:33,495
Okay, I just see how cool
you and Corey are

1283
01:04:33,497 --> 01:04:35,764
and I was hoping that someday
you and I might have that,

1284
01:04:35,766 --> 01:04:38,467
be more than just two
guys saving the world.

1285
01:04:38,469 --> 01:04:40,519
Suckerfish, Corey and I,

1286
01:04:40,520 --> 01:04:42,570
we've been buddies
since we were teens.

1287
01:04:42,573 --> 01:04:45,507
We were recruited together
and we trained together.

1288
01:04:45,509 --> 01:04:49,979
We've spoiled some pretty
crazy plots around the globe.

1289
01:04:49,981 --> 01:04:50,980
I mean,

1290
01:04:54,652 --> 01:04:57,386
you know I'm the only one
that knows Corey's real name?

1291
01:04:58,556 --> 01:04:59,555
Wow.

1292
01:05:01,559 --> 01:05:04,793
You and I, we just don't
have that history.

1293
01:05:06,897 --> 01:05:08,731
Yeah you and I don't
have that history yet,

1294
01:05:08,733 --> 01:05:09,965
but someday we might.

1295
01:05:09,967 --> 01:05:13,969
I just don't really see
that happening.

1296
01:05:16,941 --> 01:05:18,941
Oh shit, look who's here.

1297
01:05:22,947 --> 01:05:23,979
Aw, shit.

1298
01:05:29,787 --> 01:05:30,819
Aw, shit.

1299
01:05:32,590 --> 01:05:33,922
This is bad.

1300
01:05:33,924 --> 01:05:35,524
This is really bad.

1301
01:06:02,853 --> 01:06:04,853
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh nothing.

1302
01:06:04,855 --> 01:06:06,589
What's up with you?

1303
01:06:06,590 --> 01:06:08,324
Is there a reason you called me
three times, Pam?

1304
01:06:08,326 --> 01:06:09,758
I just stepped out of a meeting.

1305
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:10,993
Oh, what kind of a meeting?

1306
01:06:10,995 --> 01:06:12,361
A business meeting.

1307
01:06:12,362 --> 01:06:13,728
Oh yeah,
what were you talking about?

1308
01:06:13,731 --> 01:06:15,030
Why are you acting like this?

1309
01:06:15,032 --> 01:06:16,343
Acting like what?

1310
01:06:16,344 --> 01:06:17,655
I'm just tryin' to ask you
about your day,

1311
01:06:17,656 --> 01:06:18,967
see if you're doin' all right.

1312
01:06:18,969 --> 01:06:20,436
Curious what you're up to.

1313
01:06:20,437 --> 01:06:21,904
- That's why you called?
- Mm-hmm.

1314
01:06:21,906 --> 01:06:23,289
Oh no, actually.

1315
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:24,673
I need you to drop by the store.

1316
01:06:24,675 --> 01:06:26,742
- What?
- Yeah, it's on your way home.

1317
01:06:27,678 --> 01:06:29,778
Okay fine, just text it to me.

1318
01:06:29,780 --> 01:06:30,979
Why can't you write it down?

1319
01:06:30,981 --> 01:06:31,980
Pam.

1320
01:06:34,618 --> 01:06:36,885
Just tell me and
I'll remember, okay?

1321
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:39,655
Okay some cinnamon,
cardamom,

1322
01:06:39,657 --> 01:06:42,141
semi-sweetened
dark chocolate,

1323
01:06:42,142 --> 01:06:44,626
pine nuts, mocha extract,
light syrup, cocoa powder,

1324
01:06:44,628 --> 01:06:48,030
pastry shells and some
Popsicle sticks.

1325
01:06:48,032 --> 01:06:49,248
Okay, got it.

1326
01:06:49,249 --> 01:06:50,465
Okay,
now repeat it back to me.

1327
01:06:50,468 --> 01:06:52,518
What?

1328
01:06:52,519 --> 01:06:54,569
Just repeat it,
so I know you know.

1329
01:06:54,572 --> 01:06:55,571
I know what it is, Pam.

1330
01:06:55,573 --> 01:06:56,638
Then repeat it.

1331
01:06:59,877 --> 01:07:02,644
Popsicle sticks, cinnamon.

1332
01:07:04,115 --> 01:07:07,149
Some cinnamon, cardamom,
semi-sweetened dark chocolate,

1333
01:07:07,151 --> 01:07:09,752
pine nuts, mocha extract,
cocoa powder,

1334
01:07:09,754 --> 01:07:11,653
pastry shells and
Popsicle sticks.

1335
01:07:11,655 --> 01:07:12,788
Fine.

1336
01:07:12,790 --> 01:07:14,590
Did you write it down?

1337
01:07:14,592 --> 01:07:16,392
Pam, I told you I'll remember.

1338
01:07:16,394 --> 01:07:17,059
Oh really?

1339
01:07:17,061 --> 01:07:19,284
Oh I'm so sorry.

1340
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:21,508
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

1341
01:07:21,509 --> 01:07:23,732
Here I am rambling on and on
while you're trying to work.

1342
01:07:23,734 --> 01:07:26,068
That's it, you're hard
at work by the pool,

1343
01:07:26,070 --> 01:07:29,471
having some tramp rubbing
sun lotion in your back.

1344
01:07:29,473 --> 01:07:30,739
- Pam?
- What?

1345
01:07:30,741 --> 01:07:32,141
What's the matter?

1346
01:07:32,142 --> 01:07:33,542
You've too many
wives to remember?

1347
01:07:33,544 --> 01:07:35,677
No Pam, just wait.

1348
01:07:35,679 --> 01:07:36,690
What's with the hat?

1349
01:07:38,716 --> 01:07:40,057
God.

1350
01:07:40,058 --> 01:07:41,399
Swear to god, we need to put
an restraining order on her.

1351
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:42,741
Yeah, she can be a little crazy.

1352
01:07:42,742 --> 01:07:44,083
Maybe I should just check.

1353
01:07:47,992 --> 01:07:49,491
That's his ex-fiancee.

1354
01:07:50,094 --> 01:07:51,894
She's a tad bit delusional.

1355
01:08:01,839 --> 01:08:04,072
Shit, yeah?

1356
01:08:06,977 --> 01:08:09,545
- I hate making these calls.
- What calls?

1357
01:08:09,547 --> 01:08:10,997
The ones where I let people go.

1358
01:08:10,998 --> 01:08:12,448
What're you talkin' about, Rick?

1359
01:08:12,450 --> 01:08:13,749
I'm your best salesman, righT?

1360
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:15,184
I mean I won the free trip.

1361
01:08:15,186 --> 01:08:16,585
My sales are through the roof.

1362
01:08:16,587 --> 01:08:18,220
T-E-A-M.

1363
01:08:18,222 --> 01:08:20,889
I want team players,
not prima donnas.

1364
01:08:20,891 --> 01:08:23,091
Guys see what you're doin'
and start coppin' attitudes,

1365
01:08:23,093 --> 01:08:25,016
doin' things their way.

1366
01:08:25,017 --> 01:08:26,940
Next thing you know,
the whole company goes to shit

1367
01:08:26,941 --> 01:08:28,864
because you wanna play
the game your way.

1368
01:08:28,866 --> 01:08:30,966
I mean I think I'm settin'
an example here, Rick.

1369
01:08:30,968 --> 01:08:32,601
You know,
raising the bar a little bit.

1370
01:08:32,603 --> 01:08:34,536
What bar, what example, huh?

1371
01:08:34,538 --> 01:08:35,854
You just left.

1372
01:08:35,855 --> 01:08:37,171
I don't even know where
the hell you are right now.

1373
01:08:37,172 --> 01:08:38,488
- I went on assignment.
- Bullshit.

1374
01:08:38,489 --> 01:08:39,805
That's what I used
to say to my wife

1375
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:41,610
when I was fuckin' her sister.

1376
01:08:41,612 --> 01:08:42,644
That's it, Corey.

1377
01:08:43,614 --> 01:08:44,780
You're fired.

1378
01:08:44,782 --> 01:08:46,181
Fuck.

1379
01:08:52,790 --> 01:08:54,223
Pam, you gotta let me explain.

1380
01:08:54,225 --> 01:08:56,492
I would love to hear
your explanation

1381
01:08:56,494 --> 01:08:59,127
or you could just go with
I'm screwing somebody else.

1382
01:08:59,129 --> 01:09:00,762
I'm not having an affair.

1383
01:09:00,764 --> 01:09:01,730
I know, I know.

1384
01:09:01,732 --> 01:09:03,321
You married her.

1385
01:09:03,322 --> 01:09:04,911
You're on your honeymoon,
congratufuckinlations.

1386
01:09:04,912 --> 01:09:06,501
Pam, just listen to me.

1387
01:09:06,504 --> 01:09:08,270
Calm down and let me
explain myself.

1388
01:09:10,140 --> 01:09:11,507
Who the fuck is that?

1389
01:09:12,176 --> 01:09:13,175
The dinner party.

1390
01:09:14,778 --> 01:09:16,320
- Dinner party?

1391
01:09:16,321 --> 01:09:17,863
What fucking dinner party, Pam?

1392
01:09:17,864 --> 01:09:19,406
I mean my god,
you keep goin' on and on

1393
01:09:19,407 --> 01:09:20,949
about these dinner parties
that don't exist!

1394
01:09:20,951 --> 01:09:21,917
We bought dishes.

1395
01:09:21,919 --> 01:09:23,552
We bought a bar.

1396
01:09:23,553 --> 01:09:25,186
I installed a water feature

1397
01:09:25,187 --> 01:09:26,820
all for these dinner parties
that never seem to happen.

1398
01:09:26,824 --> 01:09:28,557
I am not canceling
my dinner party

1399
01:09:28,559 --> 01:09:31,727
just because you had
some sordid affair.

1400
01:09:31,729 --> 01:09:33,929
I wasn't cheating.

1401
01:09:36,901 --> 01:09:39,167
All right look, I'm gonna tell 'em
that we made a mistake

1402
01:09:39,169 --> 01:09:40,536
and we'll do this another night.

1403
01:09:40,538 --> 01:09:41,537
No!

1404
01:09:42,072 --> 01:09:43,739
No no, no you won't.

1405
01:09:43,741 --> 01:09:45,707
You are not ruining
my dinner party

1406
01:09:45,709 --> 01:09:47,609
just because our
marriage is over.

1407
01:09:55,019 --> 01:09:56,318
Hey, everybody.

1408
01:10:00,558 --> 01:10:02,057
Is this one of them
swingers parties?

1409
01:10:02,059 --> 01:10:04,693
'Cause we didn't
bring any rubbers.

1410
01:10:04,695 --> 01:10:06,261
We just thought that

1411
01:10:06,263 --> 01:10:07,913
it would be fine for tonight.

1412
01:10:07,914 --> 01:10:09,564
Just would be fun to get
dressed up because--

1413
01:10:09,567 --> 01:10:11,567
Yeah, well we wanted
tonight to be a--

1414
01:10:11,569 --> 01:10:13,101
- It's a theme party.
- Yeah.

1415
01:10:14,972 --> 01:10:16,605
What kinda theme?

1416
01:10:16,606 --> 01:10:18,239
- A spy theme dinner, Bob.
- Yes, exactly.

1417
01:10:18,242 --> 01:10:20,909
You see 007 just
got outta the pool.

1418
01:10:20,911 --> 01:10:22,822
And Agent 99 here

1419
01:10:22,823 --> 01:10:24,734
was just about
to make some drinks.

1420
01:10:24,735 --> 01:10:26,646
I've got martinis,
shaken, not stirred.

1421
01:10:26,650 --> 01:10:28,684
Who wants to be Money Penny?

1422
01:10:28,686 --> 01:10:29,918
All right, shall we?

1423
01:10:54,945 --> 01:11:00,048
Cheers.

1424
01:11:05,122 --> 01:11:07,823
You know Pam, we woulda
perfectly understood

1425
01:11:07,825 --> 01:11:09,124
if you needed to cancel.

1426
01:11:10,928 --> 01:11:12,294
Why would I have to cancel?

1427
01:11:12,296 --> 01:11:14,062
Well if I got fired,
the only party

1428
01:11:14,064 --> 01:11:17,766
we'd be havin' that night
is my funeral.

1429
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:25,074
You know what?

1430
01:11:25,075 --> 01:11:27,109
I think he did say
something about that.

1431
01:11:33,317 --> 01:11:35,784
You weren't supposed
to say anything, Ted.

1432
01:11:35,786 --> 01:11:37,919
Here are my Parmesan
portobello slices

1433
01:11:37,921 --> 01:11:39,121
with sun-dried tomato.

1434
01:11:40,424 --> 01:11:41,823
Pam, these are so good.

1435
01:11:41,825 --> 01:11:44,059
Do you have
a secret ingredient?

1436
01:11:44,061 --> 01:11:45,761
Oh I'm sorry, Bob.

1437
01:11:45,763 --> 01:11:48,664
My secret is what you see
is what you get.

1438
01:11:48,666 --> 01:11:52,968
No little white lies, no half-truths,
no funny little fibs.

1439
01:11:52,970 --> 01:11:54,269
Bob,
will you excuse us a second?

1440
01:11:54,271 --> 01:11:55,582
Why?

1441
01:11:55,583 --> 01:11:56,894
No, they're fine.

1442
01:11:56,895 --> 01:11:58,206
They already know that
you lost your job.

1443
01:11:58,208 --> 01:12:00,342
I just found out from Fred.

1444
01:12:00,344 --> 01:12:02,061
Oh, I'm Ted.

1445
01:12:02,062 --> 01:12:03,779
Pam,
you have to let me explain.

1446
01:12:03,781 --> 01:12:07,816
Trust me, this way
it'll be so much easier

1447
01:12:07,818 --> 01:12:09,084
to split up the assets.

1448
01:12:14,792 --> 01:12:18,226
Corey, now that we're not
competin' over the trip,

1449
01:12:18,228 --> 01:12:21,129
you wanna tell me how you
sold so many damn boxes?

1450
01:12:28,205 --> 01:12:29,971
What the fuck is this?

1451
01:12:29,973 --> 01:12:32,374
Brianna, are you okay?

1452
01:12:32,376 --> 01:12:34,076
Am I okay?

1453
01:12:34,078 --> 01:12:36,161
Am I okay?

1454
01:12:36,162 --> 01:12:38,245
I just spent an hour in the car
convincing myself

1455
01:12:38,248 --> 01:12:41,216
you didn't leap to your death
and here you are having a--

1456
01:12:41,218 --> 01:12:42,451
A dinner party.

1457
01:12:43,387 --> 01:12:44,986
- A dinner party.
- Yeah.

1458
01:12:44,988 --> 01:12:46,755
Well why wasn't I invited?

1459
01:12:46,757 --> 01:12:49,891
It's sort of a couples-only.

1460
01:12:49,893 --> 01:12:51,304
Oh, couples-only.

1461
01:12:51,305 --> 01:12:52,716
Why are you still wearing
that costume?

1462
01:12:52,717 --> 01:12:54,128
'Cause it's a spy
theme dinner party.

1463
01:12:54,131 --> 01:12:56,064
Oh, a spy theme dinner party.

1464
01:12:56,066 --> 01:12:57,999
Ooh, so fancy.

1465
01:12:58,001 --> 01:12:59,067
You know what, Pam?

1466
01:12:59,069 --> 01:13:02,054
I just can't believe
after hours of me

1467
01:13:02,055 --> 01:13:05,040
listening to your marital woes,
this is how I'm treated.

1468
01:13:06,777 --> 01:13:09,144
But if the name's not taken,
I'm Pussy Galore.

1469
01:13:15,052 --> 01:13:17,019
The hell are you doin' here?

1470
01:13:17,020 --> 01:13:18,987
- We have to get you--
- Hi, I'm Pam.

1471
01:13:18,989 --> 01:13:20,889
I didn't get to introduce
myself earlier

1472
01:13:20,891 --> 01:13:23,158
because you're whoring yourself
around with my husband.

1473
01:13:23,160 --> 01:13:25,460
But I just want to let
you know that tomorrow

1474
01:13:25,462 --> 01:13:27,613
we are getting a divorce.

1475
01:13:27,614 --> 01:13:29,765
But tonight I'm having
my dinner party, okay?

1476
01:13:29,767 --> 01:13:30,966
I came by to say that I'm sorry.

1477
01:13:30,968 --> 01:13:32,445
Sorry you got caught or sorry

1478
01:13:32,446 --> 01:13:33,923
that you're a whore
that lacks style?

1479
01:13:33,924 --> 01:13:35,401
Sorry because this isn't
what it looked like.

1480
01:13:35,405 --> 01:13:36,521
Exactly.

1481
01:13:36,522 --> 01:13:37,638
Don't insult my intelligence.

1482
01:13:37,639 --> 01:13:38,755
No, I'm serious.

1483
01:13:38,756 --> 01:13:39,872
Alexandria here is an actress.

1484
01:13:39,877 --> 01:13:40,909
A method actress actually.

1485
01:13:40,911 --> 01:13:42,544
Superbly talented.

1486
01:13:42,546 --> 01:13:44,312
Okay I saw, remember.

1487
01:13:45,816 --> 01:13:46,815
Right.

1488
01:13:47,985 --> 01:13:49,701
You see, sweetheart.

1489
01:13:49,702 --> 01:13:51,418
I found out that a huge
potential client and his wife

1490
01:13:51,421 --> 01:13:53,155
were gonna be honeymooning
over at that hotel.

1491
01:13:53,157 --> 01:13:56,558
So I thought why not hire
an actress to play my wife,

1492
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,927
go to the hotel, bond with guy
and make the big sale.

1493
01:13:58,929 --> 01:14:00,395
Yeah I mean,
it was completely legitimate.

1494
01:14:00,397 --> 01:14:02,364
I've been in the business
since I was a kid.

1495
01:14:02,366 --> 01:14:03,932
Lots of musical theater.

1496
01:14:03,934 --> 01:14:05,651
Yeah, whatever.

1497
01:14:05,652 --> 01:14:07,369
Look, why don't you help
yourself to a doggie bag

1498
01:14:07,371 --> 01:14:09,154
and then you can choke on it?

1499
01:14:09,155 --> 01:14:10,938
Oh, I'm staying here
'cause Corey hired me

1500
01:14:10,941 --> 01:14:11,973
to be here for the dinner party.

1501
01:14:11,975 --> 01:14:13,909
That's right, I did.

1502
01:14:13,911 --> 01:14:15,110
To do what?

1503
01:14:17,981 --> 01:14:19,214
To teach dance.

1504
01:14:20,217 --> 01:14:21,216
Cue the music.

1505
01:14:28,458 --> 01:14:29,891
Dance with me.

1506
01:14:40,370 --> 01:14:42,003
You lucky son of a bitch.

1507
01:14:47,344 --> 01:14:48,310
Spin me.

1508
01:14:49,613 --> 01:14:50,846
Egan's on his way.

1509
01:14:54,251 --> 01:14:56,552
You could not have
hired her tonight.

1510
01:14:56,553 --> 01:14:58,854
You didn't even remember that
we were having a dinner party.

1511
01:14:59,957 --> 01:15:02,424
You have to get these
people out of here.

1512
01:15:02,426 --> 01:15:04,392
Go ahead and ask
your wife to dance.

1513
01:15:06,563 --> 01:15:08,997
You have to get these
people out of here.

1514
01:15:08,999 --> 01:15:10,799
Fine.

1515
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,600
If people are dancing,
we're dancing.

1516
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:50,071
♪ You can try to stop me ♪

1517
01:15:50,073 --> 01:15:51,206
♪ You can ♪

1518
01:15:51,208 --> 01:15:53,041
♪ You can try to stop me ♪

1519
01:15:53,043 --> 01:15:58,179
♪ And I'm goin' 'til
the wheels fall off ♪

1520
01:15:58,949 --> 01:16:00,181
I need you to come clean.

1521
01:16:00,183 --> 01:16:01,449
Just be honest with me.

1522
01:16:03,921 --> 01:16:05,186
I mean, if I have ever
meant anything to you

1523
01:16:05,188 --> 01:16:07,289
in any level at any point,

1524
01:16:07,291 --> 01:16:10,959
I deserve to know
what's going on.

1525
01:16:19,102 --> 01:16:22,304
You're right.

1526
01:16:39,289 --> 01:16:40,288
Nobody moves.

1527
01:16:42,259 --> 01:16:43,959
Where is it?

1528
01:16:43,961 --> 01:16:44,726
Don't know.

1529
01:16:45,495 --> 01:16:47,028
I want my pen back.

1530
01:16:47,029 --> 01:16:48,562
All right all right, take it easy.

1531
01:16:48,565 --> 01:16:51,066
But leave them outta this,
they're innocent.

1532
01:16:53,236 --> 01:16:54,603
No no, yeah you're right.

1533
01:16:54,604 --> 01:16:55,971
We should just keep
this between us,

1534
01:16:55,972 --> 01:16:57,339
but I like a little bit of insurance.

1535
01:16:57,341 --> 01:16:59,308
No.

1536
01:16:59,309 --> 01:17:01,276
I want my pen back
with the plans on it

1537
01:17:01,277 --> 01:17:03,244
delivered in an hour and why
don't you gas up the jet?

1538
01:17:03,246 --> 01:17:04,346
- A jet?
- Mm-hmm.

1539
01:17:04,348 --> 01:17:06,014
And if I can't get it here by then?

1540
01:17:06,015 --> 01:17:07,681
Then your wife will die.

1541
01:17:07,684 --> 01:17:09,084
She's not his wife.

1542
01:17:09,086 --> 01:17:10,397
This is his wife.

1543
01:17:10,398 --> 01:17:11,709
Yeah, could someone
just please explain to me

1544
01:17:11,710 --> 01:17:13,021
what the hell is going on?

1545
01:17:14,091 --> 01:17:15,423
Honey, I'm a spy.

1546
01:17:15,425 --> 01:17:16,558
Okay, enough of that
charade already.

1547
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:17,525
No, I am.

1548
01:17:17,527 --> 01:17:19,477
I'm serious.

1549
01:17:19,478 --> 01:17:21,428
We work for the government
as part of an elite taskforce

1550
01:17:21,431 --> 01:17:23,498
trained to stop high-tech
futuristic weapons

1551
01:17:23,500 --> 01:17:26,601
from falling in the hands
of fuckfaces like this guy.

1552
01:17:26,603 --> 01:17:28,436
Okay, well this definitely falls

1553
01:17:28,438 --> 01:17:30,405
under reconcilable differences.

1554
01:17:34,644 --> 01:17:36,478
Hello?

1555
01:17:36,479 --> 01:17:38,313
Smuts, I need you to bring me
the pen right away.

1556
01:17:45,055 --> 01:17:46,388
Okay.

1557
01:17:46,389 --> 01:17:47,722
You guys weren't
actually married?

1558
01:17:47,724 --> 01:17:49,424
No.

1559
01:17:49,426 --> 01:17:51,426
But your ring seemed so real.

1560
01:17:51,428 --> 01:17:53,028
It was cubic zirconia.

1561
01:17:53,030 --> 01:17:54,195
- Shut up.
- Mm-hmm.

1562
01:17:54,197 --> 01:17:56,364
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1563
01:17:56,366 --> 01:17:58,066
So is mine.

1564
01:17:58,067 --> 01:17:59,767
Wait, but you guys seem
so happy together.

1565
01:17:59,768 --> 01:18:01,468
No, you guys seemed
so happy together.

1566
01:18:01,471 --> 01:18:02,837
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1567
01:18:02,838 --> 01:18:04,204
Nobody's actually
happy here, okay?

1568
01:18:04,205 --> 01:18:05,571
Let's review: you and I
aren't married.

1569
01:18:05,575 --> 01:18:07,342
These two aren't married.

1570
01:18:07,343 --> 01:18:09,110
The only people here that
are really married are them.

1571
01:18:09,112 --> 01:18:10,312
Oh, no.

1572
01:18:10,313 --> 01:18:11,513
No, actually we're
getting a divorce.

1573
01:18:12,716 --> 01:18:14,616
Oh fuck, my lasagna.

1574
01:18:14,618 --> 01:18:16,284
Whoa, excuse me?

1575
01:18:16,286 --> 01:18:17,419
My lasagna, it's burning.

1576
01:18:17,421 --> 01:18:18,720
I need to get it.

1577
01:18:18,722 --> 01:18:19,788
Are you kidding me?

1578
01:18:19,790 --> 01:18:21,506
Are you kidding me?

1579
01:18:21,507 --> 01:18:23,223
Do you want this house
to burn down?

1580
01:18:23,226 --> 01:18:24,604
I don't care.

1581
01:18:24,605 --> 01:18:25,983
To him sweetheart, I don't think

1582
01:18:25,984 --> 01:18:27,362
your lasagna's
the key issue here.

1583
01:18:28,565 --> 01:18:31,733
It's actually not my lasagna,
it's Stouffer's.

1584
01:18:31,735 --> 01:18:34,335
You want me to serve
Stouffer's at our dinner party?

1585
01:18:34,337 --> 01:18:36,271
Well I was gonna make it
from scratch,

1586
01:18:36,273 --> 01:18:39,474
but you in the midst were
playing spy meets adulterer

1587
01:18:39,476 --> 01:18:42,210
meets probably the worst
husband in the world.

1588
01:18:42,212 --> 01:18:43,645
Honey,
I think you're overreacting

1589
01:18:43,647 --> 01:18:45,146
just a little bit here, all right?

1590
01:18:45,148 --> 01:18:46,748
I'm gonna take care of this.

1591
01:18:46,749 --> 01:18:48,349
Overreacting?

1592
01:18:48,351 --> 01:18:49,984
Overreacting.

1593
01:18:49,985 --> 01:18:51,618
Do you know how
humiliating this is?

1594
01:18:53,090 --> 01:18:54,489
You know how
heartbreaking it is

1595
01:18:54,491 --> 01:18:56,224
to have your marriage
be over within...

1596
01:18:56,226 --> 01:18:57,425
Okay.

1597
01:18:57,427 --> 01:18:58,726
Oh, in a year?

1598
01:19:00,497 --> 01:19:01,890
Seriously?

1599
01:19:01,891 --> 01:19:03,284
I'm now a statistic.

1600
01:19:03,285 --> 01:19:04,678
I'm one of those,

1601
01:19:04,679 --> 01:19:06,072
one of those people
where you probably

1602
01:19:06,073 --> 01:19:07,466
had some I don't know Navy
SEAL mental training shit

1603
01:19:07,471 --> 01:19:10,638
where you know how to handle
all these sorts of situations

1604
01:19:10,640 --> 01:19:12,407
to probably diffuse a bomb
under pressure.

1605
01:19:12,409 --> 01:19:13,508
The hell is she doin'?

1606
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,113
I'm leaving.

1607
01:19:18,115 --> 01:19:20,215
I'm packing my things.

1608
01:19:20,216 --> 01:19:22,316
You can shoot me if you want,
but otherwise I'm moving out.

1609
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,120
Can you stop her?

1610
01:19:25,122 --> 01:19:26,338
Can you stop her?

1611
01:19:26,339 --> 01:19:27,555
Yeah, I could shoot her.

1612
01:19:36,333 --> 01:19:37,332
Let's go.

1613
01:19:40,704 --> 01:19:42,504
I knew we should've
gone to Nepal.

1614
01:19:42,506 --> 01:19:43,671
If not Nepal, Paris.

1615
01:19:43,673 --> 01:19:45,473
If not Pairs, London.

1616
01:19:45,475 --> 01:19:47,842
I mean just done something,

1617
01:19:47,843 --> 01:19:50,210
anything to escape the confines
of this ridiculous place.

1618
01:19:50,213 --> 01:19:52,180
Pam, sweetheart.

1619
01:19:52,181 --> 01:19:54,148
Let's just get through this
and we can reset, okay?

1620
01:19:54,151 --> 01:19:55,784
We'll call it
a second honeymoon.

1621
01:19:55,785 --> 01:19:57,418
We can go to all those places,
I promise.

1622
01:19:57,420 --> 01:19:59,053
Okay, so now you don't mind

1623
01:19:59,054 --> 01:20:00,687
about skipping our
weekend projects?

1624
01:20:00,690 --> 01:20:02,557
You know putting off
the track lighting,

1625
01:20:02,559 --> 01:20:06,161
not even fixing the ceiling
that constantly crumbles.

1626
01:20:12,435 --> 01:20:14,486
How many times do I have
to tell you, Pam

1627
01:20:14,487 --> 01:20:16,538
that I will get to it
when I fucking get to it.

1628
01:20:18,708 --> 01:20:21,209
Press the red button
under the bed.

1629
01:20:23,380 --> 01:20:24,512
Holy shit.

1630
01:20:28,585 --> 01:20:30,451
Okay, what is that?

1631
01:20:30,453 --> 01:20:32,754
That's a high-tech electrical
charge particle solidifier.

1632
01:20:32,756 --> 01:20:35,190
In short, force field.

1633
01:20:35,192 --> 01:20:38,293
So you just had this stuff here
the whole time?

1634
01:20:39,462 --> 01:20:40,361
Yeah, pretty much.

1635
01:20:40,363 --> 01:20:41,329
Sorry.

1636
01:20:41,331 --> 01:20:43,765
You never thought about pulling out
one of these gizmos

1637
01:20:43,766 --> 01:20:46,200
when we were getting intimate?

1638
01:20:47,437 --> 01:20:49,304
You would've wanted that?

1639
01:20:49,306 --> 01:20:51,339
Yeah, I would've tried that.

1640
01:20:51,341 --> 01:20:54,342
Well, we can.

1641
01:20:54,343 --> 01:20:57,344
Corey, I'm not having
anymore dinner parties.

1642
01:21:35,986 --> 01:21:37,819
Anyone for charades?

1643
01:21:39,022 --> 01:21:40,488
Who wants a nightcap?

1644
01:21:45,528 --> 01:21:46,928
60 off 10th Avenue.

1645
01:21:46,930 --> 01:21:49,114
Come on.

1646
01:21:54,704 --> 01:21:56,671
I just have one question.

1647
01:21:56,673 --> 01:21:58,273
Yeah?

1648
01:21:58,275 --> 01:21:59,641
Is your real name Corey?

1649
01:22:02,412 --> 01:22:03,511
I wish it was.

1650
01:22:06,416 --> 01:22:07,415
Goodbye.

1651
01:22:24,601 --> 01:22:27,935
- Where are ya headed?
- Does it matter?

1652
01:22:43,086 --> 01:22:44,686
Whoa, hey.

1653
01:22:44,688 --> 01:22:46,587
Were you serious?

1654
01:22:46,589 --> 01:22:48,456
Brianna, wasn't it your idea

1655
01:22:48,458 --> 01:22:50,358
for me to get out of here
and see the world?

1656
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:51,859
I mean it was and then
we tried it

1657
01:22:51,861 --> 01:22:53,995
and it was really exhausting,
you know?

1658
01:22:53,997 --> 01:22:55,285
It's like kinky sex.

1659
01:22:55,286 --> 01:22:56,574
You think you want it
'til you actually have it

1660
01:22:56,575 --> 01:22:57,863
and end up with a penis
in your ear.

1661
01:22:57,867 --> 01:22:59,500
That's disgusting.

1662
01:23:00,403 --> 01:23:02,003
Do you even have a plan?

1663
01:23:02,005 --> 01:23:03,054
Yeah.

1664
01:23:03,055 --> 01:23:04,104
What's your plan?

1665
01:23:04,107 --> 01:23:05,973
To climb Mount Everest.

1666
01:23:05,975 --> 01:23:08,543
To climb Mount Everest, really?

1667
01:23:08,545 --> 01:23:11,713
What, are you working for
"National Geographic" now?

1668
01:23:32,936 --> 01:23:36,671
Undercover: Discover
who you really are.

1669
01:23:48,768 --> 01:23:49,784
What about Cairo?

1670
01:23:50,687 --> 01:23:51,652
Yeah?

1671
01:23:53,656 --> 01:23:56,391
- Cozumel?
- Cozumel's cool.

1672
01:23:57,527 --> 01:24:01,896
Dude, what's wrong?

1673
01:24:02,799 --> 01:24:04,031
Nothin's wrong, man.

1674
01:24:04,801 --> 01:24:05,800
Okay.

1675
01:24:07,036 --> 01:24:09,036
Oh, what about Rio?

1676
01:24:09,038 --> 01:24:10,405
I like Rio, you know that.

1677
01:24:10,407 --> 01:24:11,472
I love Rio.

1678
01:24:12,809 --> 01:24:14,008
What?

1679
01:24:14,010 --> 01:24:15,643
You're not excited about Rio.

1680
01:24:15,645 --> 01:24:16,944
Okay, you must've forgotten

1681
01:24:16,946 --> 01:24:19,230
about that night
in the rainforest.

1682
01:24:19,231 --> 01:24:21,515
I didn't forget about the night
in the rainforest, Smuts.

1683
01:24:22,519 --> 01:24:23,551
Why can't we keep it simple,
you know?

1684
01:24:23,553 --> 01:24:24,419
Like in the movie.

1685
01:24:24,421 --> 01:24:25,420
What?

1686
01:24:26,456 --> 01:24:27,672
Okay, okay.

1687
01:24:27,673 --> 01:24:28,889
Three feet, three feet,
three feet.

1688
01:24:30,827 --> 01:24:32,693
Okay, that's it.

1689
01:24:32,695 --> 01:24:33,961
The sun's sizzling your brain.

1690
01:24:33,963 --> 01:24:35,196
We've climbed too close.

1691
01:24:35,198 --> 01:24:37,098
C'mon, we need some UV.

1692
01:24:37,934 --> 01:24:39,734
Here, use this.

1693
01:24:39,736 --> 01:24:40,868
It really works.

1694
01:24:40,870 --> 01:24:41,803
Yeah, I know.

1695
01:24:41,805 --> 01:24:43,622
I got the whole line.

1696
01:24:43,623 --> 01:24:45,440
Even their eye moisturizer's
incredible, isn't it?

1697
01:24:45,442 --> 01:24:46,841
Soothing, too.

1698
01:24:46,843 --> 01:24:48,676
You really miss her, don't ya?

1699
01:24:50,447 --> 01:24:51,446
I do not.

1700
01:24:51,448 --> 01:24:54,782
From my perspective,
you never stopped loving her.

1701
01:24:54,784 --> 01:24:56,584
No matter what your cover was,

1702
01:24:56,586 --> 01:24:58,586
you can't disguise
what's in your heart.

1703
01:25:00,557 --> 01:25:01,522
Yeah.

1704
01:25:02,992 --> 01:25:04,942
Yeah, maybe.

1705
01:25:04,943 --> 01:25:06,893
You know, I really didn't hear
what you said.

1706
01:25:06,896 --> 01:25:09,997
But that sounded really
fucking beautiful, Suckerfish.

1707
01:25:09,999 --> 01:25:10,998
Thanks, man.

1708
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:16,070
Hey, you wanna get a beer
with me later on?

1709
01:25:16,072 --> 01:25:17,071
I'd like that.

1710
01:25:17,073 --> 01:25:18,739
Just kidding.

1711
01:25:18,741 --> 01:25:20,608
I'm not for the sweet stuff,
let's move.

1712
01:25:25,548 --> 01:25:27,815
Hold up, we got a problem.

1713
01:25:42,632 --> 01:25:43,898
Excuse me, sir.

1714
01:25:44,767 --> 01:25:46,167
Jimbo?

1715
01:25:46,169 --> 01:25:47,602
Very good Jimbo.

1716
01:25:50,607 --> 01:25:52,006
Debit or credit?

1717
01:26:20,870 --> 01:26:23,838
"Pam,
I hope you enjoy the basket.

1718
01:26:23,840 --> 01:26:26,524
"I think it would've been perfect

1719
01:26:26,525 --> 01:26:29,209
"for the second dinner party
we never got to have."

1720
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:32,547
Dinner party.

1721
01:26:33,783 --> 01:26:35,316
What dinner party?

1722
01:27:17,827 --> 01:27:19,827
What the hell is this?

1723
01:27:19,829 --> 01:27:23,364
Corey, this is an intervention.

1724
01:27:23,366 --> 01:27:24,699
Oh god, not again.

1725
01:27:24,701 --> 01:27:25,783
For what?

1726
01:27:25,784 --> 01:27:26,866
Because you're miserable.

1727
01:27:26,869 --> 01:27:28,269
I'm not miserable.

1728
01:27:29,872 --> 01:27:31,739
Oh, no no no no.

1729
01:27:31,741 --> 01:27:33,057
What?

1730
01:27:33,058 --> 01:27:34,374
Yeah, we started dating
after the dinner party.

1731
01:27:34,375 --> 01:27:35,691
You've been dating
Brianna this whole time

1732
01:27:35,692 --> 01:27:37,008
and you didn't tell me?

1733
01:27:37,013 --> 01:27:39,380
Look,
what was I supposed to say?

1734
01:27:39,381 --> 01:27:41,748
I mean I'm in covert ops with
your ex-wife's best friend?

1735
01:27:41,751 --> 01:27:43,851
I love it when he talks like that.

1736
01:27:43,853 --> 01:27:44,852
You guys?

1737
01:27:47,023 --> 01:27:48,656
I figured you hated me.

1738
01:27:48,658 --> 01:27:51,859
I was a total pain in the ass
and completely self-centered.

1739
01:27:51,861 --> 01:27:54,061
I don't care what you were.

1740
01:27:54,063 --> 01:27:55,847
After I canned your ass,

1741
01:27:55,848 --> 01:27:57,632
these guys wouldn't shut
up about your spy tactics.

1742
01:27:57,634 --> 01:27:59,066
When I finally let them try it,

1743
01:27:59,068 --> 01:28:01,068
they broke all
your sales records.

1744
01:28:01,070 --> 01:28:03,404
Yup, made him go method.

1745
01:28:03,406 --> 01:28:05,156
We also got a bowling coach

1746
01:28:05,157 --> 01:28:06,907
and kicked the shit
outta Diana's Floral.

1747
01:28:06,909 --> 01:28:08,876
Bob's been wearin'
his wrist guard.

1748
01:28:08,878 --> 01:28:11,312
All right, well

1749
01:28:11,314 --> 01:28:12,980
this is all well and good, guys.

1750
01:28:12,982 --> 01:28:14,915
But somebody please tell me

1751
01:28:14,917 --> 01:28:18,319
why the hell you went through
all this trouble and what for?

1752
01:28:18,321 --> 01:28:20,187
Because I had to test
the new tranq gun.

1753
01:28:26,763 --> 01:28:28,279
Hey.

1754
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:29,796
- It's actually my tranq gun.
- Dude.

1755
01:28:29,799 --> 01:28:32,417
So, you're the reason
for this intervention?

1756
01:28:32,418 --> 01:28:35,036
Well, if you're not too busy
tryin' to save the world,

1757
01:28:35,038 --> 01:28:37,304
I thought we should
give us another shot,

1758
01:28:38,107 --> 01:28:39,240
a different shot.

1759
01:28:39,242 --> 01:28:41,643
You know if you hadn't
been a spy,

1760
01:28:41,644 --> 01:28:44,045
I would've never woken up
and realized who I really am.

1761
01:28:45,214 --> 01:28:48,015
What about just being
still looking in the mirror?

1762
01:28:48,951 --> 01:28:51,252
Where's the adventure
in that, my dear?

1763
01:28:51,254 --> 01:28:53,788
So, does this mean we get
to take a second honeymoon?

1764
01:28:53,790 --> 01:28:54,922
Anywhere you want.

1765
01:28:54,924 --> 01:28:57,909
What do you think
about Kathmandu?

1766
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:00,895
Oh you know what they say,
"What happens in Kathmandu,

1767
01:29:00,897 --> 01:29:02,897
- "stays in Kathmandu."
- "Stays in Kathmandu."

1768
01:29:07,370 --> 01:29:10,037
