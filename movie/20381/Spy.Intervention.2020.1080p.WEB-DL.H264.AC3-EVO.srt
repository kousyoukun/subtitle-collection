1
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:33,565
- At the dawn of time,

2
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:36,568
the roles of men and
women were well-defined.

3
00:00:44,712 --> 00:00:46,779
He who lived an
adventurous life,

4
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:49,314
hunting, foraging and providing,

5
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:52,584
while she stayed in the
security of their cave dwelling

6
00:00:52,586 --> 00:00:54,553
and made what little
they had at home.

7
00:00:58,159 --> 00:01:01,326
But over millions of years,
something strange happened:

8
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:03,712
the lines blurred.

9
00:01:03,713 --> 00:01:06,097
Call it evolution or
straight up confusion,

10
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,335
but the modern relationship
is so complicated.

11
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:13,672
Just like every other
couple throughout history,

12
00:01:13,674 --> 00:01:15,340
we had plenty of our own issues.

13
00:01:15,342 --> 00:01:17,476
While most people
plan a date night,

14
00:01:17,478 --> 00:01:20,179
see a therapist or
secretly take out

15
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:21,847
their frustrations during sex,

16
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,583
we needed something
much more intense.

17
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:26,285
We needed an intervention.

18
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:30,222
I guess we should
start at the beginning.

19
00:01:30,224 --> 00:01:33,459
When Pam and I first met,
like every other guy,

20
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:35,461
I was just trying to
scratch out a living.

21
00:01:36,864 --> 00:01:40,299
What about Venice?
- Nah, too cliche.

22
00:01:40,301 --> 00:01:41,733
- Yeah.

23
00:01:41,735 --> 00:01:42,701
Tokyo?

24
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:47,106
- You know, I don't think
Francesca eats sushi.

25
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:48,373
- Yeah well, we
can't just take 'em

26
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,541
to New York for
dinner this month.

27
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:50,509
That's amateur.

28
00:01:50,511 --> 00:01:53,245
- I don't know,
they're Black Ops.

29
00:01:53,247 --> 00:01:54,847
Their standards are pretty high.

30
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:57,616
- Well I'll think of somethin'.

31
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,684
- Yeah.

32
00:02:09,597 --> 00:02:11,296
- What about Paris?

33
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,121
- Well with everything
goin' on there,

34
00:02:14,122 --> 00:02:15,533
I don't wanna feel
like I'm on-call.

35
00:02:24,245 --> 00:02:25,961
- Nah, you're right.

36
00:02:25,962 --> 00:02:27,678
I'll think of somethin'
a little more exotic

37
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:30,782
off the grid.

38
00:02:33,587 --> 00:02:36,889
You didn't see that or this.

39
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:40,859
I've got it.
- What?

40
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:42,194
- Kathmandu.

41
00:02:42,897 --> 00:02:45,631
- Kathman-fucking-du, yes!

42
00:02:45,633 --> 00:02:47,199
- The girls are gonna love
the little restaurants

43
00:02:47,201 --> 00:02:48,767
and dive bars in the Himalayas.

44
00:02:56,577 --> 00:02:59,311
The important thing is
what happens in Kathmandu,

45
00:02:59,313 --> 00:03:00,646
stays in Kathmandu.

46
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,320
- I've got our target,

47
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:09,388
Egan Doyle.

48
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:11,624
We don't know what
kind of weapon

49
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,859
he's trying to
acquire or from whom.

50
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:17,329
He's moving quickly
through the concourse.

51
00:03:32,947 --> 00:03:34,479
- I'm so sorry, are you okay?

52
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,948
- No no, I'm not okay.

53
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:38,750
- What?

54
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,390
- That really fucking hurt.

55
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:52,908
- Corey, what's goin' on?

56
00:03:52,909 --> 00:03:54,564
- I just don't know what
would make you in such a rush.

57
00:03:54,568 --> 00:03:55,867
You don't have to be running
recklessly through a mall

58
00:03:55,869 --> 00:03:57,903
without looking
where you're going.

59
00:03:57,905 --> 00:03:59,349
I mean it was rude

60
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,794
and I've just gotten
to a point in my life

61
00:04:00,795 --> 00:04:02,239
where I'm gonna be one of
these people that speaks up,

62
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,742
so this is me speaking up.

63
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:06,278
And I'm just curious what
you might have to say

64
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,579
other than you're sorry

65
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:08,879
because you've already
fucking said that.

66
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:16,788
- I don't know.

67
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,526
- Sorry, I overstepped.

68
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,497
Here I am giving lectures
when I should just be

69
00:04:25,499 --> 00:04:27,566
I'm handing out free samples.

70
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,568
- What the hell are
you doin', Corey?

71
00:04:29,570 --> 00:04:31,871
Go get Egan.

72
00:04:31,872 --> 00:04:34,173
- It's all about
customer appreciation

73
00:04:34,174 --> 00:04:36,475
and I want you to know
that I appreciate you.

74
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:39,278
- I feel appreciated.

75
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:42,848
- Whoa, your hands.

76
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:45,717
They're like sandpaper.

77
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:49,588
What, are you in
construction or something?

78
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,689
- What the?

79
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,559
- No, I'm not in construction.

80
00:04:54,561 --> 00:04:57,562
I work in cardboard,
sell cardboard boxes.

81
00:05:00,701 --> 00:05:03,035
- Right well if you want,

82
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,670
you can join our
membership club.

83
00:05:04,672 --> 00:05:06,805
We can send you, you
know information,

84
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,006
specials and coupons.

85
00:05:08,008 --> 00:05:10,742
I just need your email.

86
00:05:10,744 --> 00:05:12,978
- Yeah, join the club.

87
00:05:16,016 --> 00:05:17,015
- Great.

88
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,655
- I'm Corey.

89
00:05:23,657 --> 00:05:24,656
- I'm Pam.

90
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:30,729
- Corey.

91
00:05:30,731 --> 00:05:32,364
Is this thing even working?

92
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,365
Corey.

93
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:36,835
Corey, Corey!

94
00:05:37,704 --> 00:05:38,570
- Shit, I'm sorry.

95
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:39,604
I have to go.

96
00:05:39,606 --> 00:05:41,006
- Is everything okay?

97
00:05:41,008 --> 00:05:42,007
- Just a business meeting.

98
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:43,475
- What about your email?

99
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,877
- Don't
worry, I'll find you.

100
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,019
- Fuck, shit.

101
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:55,954
We lost Egan.

102
00:05:57,991 --> 00:05:59,358
We lost Egan.

103
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,094
What the fuck?

104
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:14,673
- Jeez, thought it was a bug.

105
00:06:18,412 --> 00:06:21,513
Don't freak out, Corey's
gonna be here any minute.

106
00:06:24,852 --> 00:06:27,452
- So you're looking
at Havenshire County's

107
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,755
year five figure
skating champion.

108
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,725
- Wow, you're really good.

109
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:42,067
- Oh my god.

110
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:45,537
Were you in the
Olympics or something?

111
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,572
- Just a little ice
hockey growin' up.

112
00:06:49,009 --> 00:06:51,443
- I knew it.
- What?

113
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,511
- You're gonna be
one of those guys

114
00:06:52,513 --> 00:06:54,013
who's good at everything.

115
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:55,514
- What's wrong with
being good at everything?

116
00:06:55,516 --> 00:06:57,616
- Knowing you're
good at everything,

117
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,885
nothing will ever
make you happy.

118
00:06:59,887 --> 00:07:00,853
- That's not true.

119
00:07:00,854 --> 00:07:01,820
I'm totally happy.
- Are you?

120
00:07:01,822 --> 00:07:02,854
- Yeah, I am.

121
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:07,426
- You wanna know what I think?

122
00:07:07,428 --> 00:07:09,161
I think you're one of those guys

123
00:07:09,162 --> 00:07:10,895
who's always gonna be
looking up at the clouds

124
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,465
tryin' to figure
out the next dream,

125
00:07:13,467 --> 00:07:15,834
the next accomplishment
trying to see

126
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:18,904
every little part of the
world and how to escape to it

127
00:07:18,906 --> 00:07:21,740
all so you don't have
to look in the mirror

128
00:07:21,742 --> 00:07:23,575
and find out who you really are.

129
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,080
- Where's the adventure
in that, my dear?

130
00:07:30,517 --> 00:07:33,852
- The adventure is finding
out what's really inside.

131
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,242
- It's still kinda early.

132
00:07:40,243 --> 00:07:41,726
What do you feel like doin'?

133
00:07:41,728 --> 00:07:44,863
- No, it's your turn.

134
00:07:44,865 --> 00:07:47,966
You can't expect me to
come up with everything.

135
00:07:48,735 --> 00:07:49,901
- All right, well we can hop

136
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:51,736
a jet to New York, catch a play.

137
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:55,707
Jump on a yacht to Tahiti.

138
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,159
- Yeah.

139
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,610
- Or we can head to
Kenya for a safari.

140
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:01,146
- Your head, it's in the clouds.

141
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,849
For a guy who sells
cardboard boxes for a living,

142
00:08:03,851 --> 00:08:06,551
you have quite the imagination.

143
00:08:08,622 --> 00:08:09,788
- Yeah, I guess I do.

144
00:08:13,627 --> 00:08:15,894
- Look, I've gotta get
up early in the morning

145
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:18,897
to open the store, so I think
we should call it a night.

146
00:08:20,033 --> 00:08:21,967
- Yeah.

147
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:23,902
Yeah, we'll call it a rain
check on our next adventure.

148
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:33,534
- Look, I hope I didn't
freak you out earlier

149
00:08:33,535 --> 00:08:35,213
with my whole anti-thrill
seeking diagnosis.

150
00:08:37,284 --> 00:08:40,018
- There's something about you.

151
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:44,656
There's a word for it.

152
00:08:44,658 --> 00:08:46,258
You're just--
- Oh god, no.

153
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:48,793
No, look I've been
on way too many dates

154
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:50,095
where people pretend.

155
00:08:50,097 --> 00:08:51,563
You know, they're
not themselves.

156
00:08:51,565 --> 00:08:52,814
It's not me.

157
00:08:52,815 --> 00:08:54,064
What you see is what you get.

158
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:56,090
- No, I get it.

159
00:08:56,091 --> 00:08:57,313
I'd much rather have
you be real than--

160
00:08:57,314 --> 00:08:58,536
- Present something I'm not?

161
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:02,073
- Right, yeah.

162
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:07,579
- I guess if you do
wanna come over, you can.

163
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,947
But I'm gonna be
watching a movie

164
00:09:08,949 --> 00:09:11,049
and I have laundry,
like a lot of laundry.

165
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,651
Stacks of it, in fact.

166
00:09:12,653 --> 00:09:14,586
- Love to do laundry
and watch a movie.

167
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:25,096
- Great.

168
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:44,716
- Are you good?
- Yeah, I'm good.

169
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:45,817
You?

170
00:09:45,819 --> 00:09:46,818
- Yeah.

171
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:56,628
- Fuck!
- What the hell

172
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:57,696
is wrong with you?

173
00:09:57,697 --> 00:09:58,763
You're messin' me up.

174
00:09:58,764 --> 00:09:59,830
- Coffee.
- You never miss.

175
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,416
- Yeah well, it must be the gun.

176
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,000
- You know ever since we
failed that Egan mission,

177
00:10:03,003 --> 00:10:05,137
you haven't been the same.

178
00:10:05,138 --> 00:10:07,272
- All right Smuts, I failed
one fuckin' mission one time.

179
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,240
It's bound to happen
sooner or later, 'kay?

180
00:10:09,242 --> 00:10:11,242
- Well it wouldn't have happened

181
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,243
if you weren't off
flirting with Pat.

182
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:15,046
- It's Pam.
- Whatever.

183
00:10:16,183 --> 00:10:18,984
Just tell me you're not
gettin' serious with this girl.

184
00:10:19,753 --> 00:10:21,253
- Trust me.

185
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:22,754
Pam and I, we're
just havin' fun.

186
00:10:22,756 --> 00:10:24,189
There's nothin'
serious about it.

187
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,557
- 45 seconds to play

188
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:26,924
in the sudden death overtime.

189
00:10:34,167 --> 00:10:35,533
- Who would you do

190
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:36,900
if you could be someone
completely different?

191
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:38,737
- What do you mean?

192
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:41,172
- Don't you ever think about
making some drastic change?

193
00:10:41,174 --> 00:10:43,274
You know, taking
some risk and chance

194
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,343
just to be something else.

195
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:48,680
- Oh yeah, sure.

196
00:10:48,682 --> 00:10:49,848
I mean why not buy a
three-bedroom house

197
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,784
and sell boxes from one place

198
00:10:51,785 --> 00:10:53,719
rather than chase corporate
accounts all over the world?

199
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:55,654
- No no no no, you have
to be something else.

200
00:10:55,656 --> 00:10:58,657
I mean like for me, I've
always always always

201
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:01,159
wanted to have my makeup line.

202
00:11:02,062 --> 00:11:04,095
- Really?
- Yeah, absolutely.

203
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,131
I mean I can see the
packaging field the products.

204
00:11:06,133 --> 00:11:07,599
I once even worked
for the chemists

205
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,066
in developing this
firming cream.

206
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,336
- Firming cream, what
is firming cream?

207
00:11:11,338 --> 00:11:14,205
- Oh you don't have to worry
about it, you don't need it

208
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:16,908
yet.

209
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:19,044
- All right.

210
00:11:19,046 --> 00:11:21,413
So if you got it over
here, why not do it now?

211
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:23,715
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

212
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:26,785
- So says the
cardboard box salesman.

213
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,186
Why don't you just
change your career

214
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:30,121
and become what
you're dying to be?

215
00:11:31,224 --> 00:11:32,824
- How do you know I won't?

216
00:11:35,696 --> 00:11:37,328
- Well, I know.

217
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:40,365
I mean as much as I see myself
commanding a makeup empire,

218
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:42,801
I don't wanna sacrifice
everything I have now.

219
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,836
I think it'd be easier
climbing Mount Everest.

220
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:45,804
- don't know 'bout that.

221
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:46,771
It's pretty difficult.

222
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:49,107
I'd imagine.

223
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:50,275
Although, the Napelese

224
00:11:51,244 --> 00:11:52,811
food is pretty good I hear.

225
00:11:55,315 --> 00:11:57,148
- So how long have
you been thinking

226
00:11:57,149 --> 00:11:58,982
about that three-bedroom house
with the white picket fence?

227
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:02,987
- Ever since I met you.

228
00:12:07,994 --> 00:12:08,993
- Yeah?

229
00:12:08,995 --> 00:12:11,362
I sort of had a similar thought.

230
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,731
- You did?

231
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:14,099
- Yeah, like this morning.

232
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,467
I was at Target and I
saw this dinnerware set

233
00:12:15,469 --> 00:12:18,737
and I just suddenly thought
these would be perfect

234
00:12:19,272 --> 00:12:20,739
for our dinner parties.

235
00:12:21,742 --> 00:12:24,509
- You want dinner parties?

236
00:12:24,511 --> 00:12:25,510
- Corey,

237
00:12:29,883 --> 00:12:33,384
we're gonna have a
lot of dinner parties.

238
00:13:02,082 --> 00:13:03,248
- There you go.

239
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:06,718
- Is that all?

240
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,386
- Is that gonna make me young
enough to make you the cougar?

241
00:13:08,388 --> 00:13:10,789
- Yeah, well

242
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,791
they do come highly recommended.

243
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:14,025
- You ever seen one of these?

244
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,560
They take ya all over the world.

245
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:17,094
You could ride the Harry
train with me there.

246
00:13:17,097 --> 00:13:18,563
- Okay, maybe one day.

247
00:13:18,564 --> 00:13:20,030
- Don't take me off
your boyfriend list.

248
00:13:20,031 --> 00:13:21,497
- I won't.

249
00:13:21,501 --> 00:13:23,268
- Cheers.

250
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,036
- Have a great day.
- See ya soon.

251
00:13:25,037 --> 00:13:26,804
- Bye, thank you
so much. 

252
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:32,043
I don't have a gag reflex
in case you were wondering.

253
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,815
- Here we go.

254
00:13:36,817 --> 00:13:39,584
- You are a moron.
- Mm-hmm, why?

255
00:13:39,586 --> 00:13:41,352
- 'Cause he had a
frickin' black card.

256
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,455
- So?

257
00:13:43,456 --> 00:13:45,557
- So that card is an
insurance policy, Pam.

258
00:13:45,559 --> 00:13:47,292
That card says you
never have to work

259
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,093
at this shitty job ever again.

260
00:13:49,095 --> 00:13:50,829
That card says sorry, Brianna.

261
00:13:50,831 --> 00:13:52,597
I can't make it to
your birthday party

262
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,364
because my husband and I are
vacationing in the Swiss Alps

263
00:13:54,367 --> 00:13:56,234
and then we're going
to our Italian villa

264
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:57,969
where we're gonna be
waited on hand-and-foot

265
00:13:57,971 --> 00:14:00,004
by bronze-chested man servants.

266
00:14:00,006 --> 00:14:01,506
- Brianna, you know
I'm in a relationship.

267
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:04,075
- Corey
sells boxes, Pam.

268
00:14:04,077 --> 00:14:04,843
Okay?

269
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:05,610
I mean is he cute?

270
00:14:05,612 --> 00:14:06,522
Yeah.

271
00:14:06,523 --> 00:14:07,433
Does his ass look good
in a pair of jeans?

272
00:14:07,434 --> 00:14:08,344
Sure.

273
00:14:08,345 --> 00:14:09,255
Does he have a good personality?

274
00:14:09,256 --> 00:14:10,166
Why not?

275
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,077
But at the end of the day,

276
00:14:11,084 --> 00:14:14,352
he sells cardboard
fucking boxes, Pam.

277
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:15,420
Do you know how boring that is?

278
00:14:15,422 --> 00:14:17,121
- It's not boring.

279
00:14:17,123 --> 00:14:18,823
Is he James Bond?

280
00:14:18,824 --> 00:14:20,524
No, but like I don't
want a James Bond.

281
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,527
- Well good 'cause
you got James Bland.

282
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,262
- I just want someone
I can depend on.

283
00:14:24,264 --> 00:14:27,498
Someone that is stable,
like-minded, consistent.

284
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,284
- Well you shoulda told me
you were looking for that

285
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,069
'cause I woulda hooked you
up with my grandfather.

286
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:32,136
- Okay.

287
00:14:34,074 --> 00:14:35,490
Okay.

288
00:14:35,491 --> 00:14:36,907
What does he do, eat
your pussy really good?

289
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,543
I don't know, I don't get it.

290
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:40,245
I can't answer that question.

291
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,180
- You just
quit, what the hell?

292
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:45,083
- This whole spy life isn't
what I want anymore, Smuts.

293
00:14:45,085 --> 00:14:47,252
You said it yourself,
I haven't been the same

294
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:48,653
since I failed
that last mission.

295
00:14:48,655 --> 00:14:50,021
It's 'cause I'm not.

296
00:14:50,023 --> 00:14:52,056
- God.

297
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:57,027
Please don't start with that
romantic dribble about Pat.

298
00:14:58,231 --> 00:15:00,298
- It's Pam.

299
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,366
And yes she's what I care
about, Smuts all right?

300
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:03,969
I love her.

301
00:15:03,970 --> 00:15:05,570
I'm ready to live
that normal life

302
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,171
that we've always
been protecting.

303
00:15:08,308 --> 00:15:09,307
- Really?

304
00:15:10,143 --> 00:15:12,110
Wow, okay.

305
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:16,047
So you're telling me that
you can't wait to go out,

306
00:15:16,049 --> 00:15:19,417
assume your cover,
sell cardboard boxes

307
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,453
be chained to a desk,
join a bowling league,

308
00:15:22,455 --> 00:15:25,123
start paying taxes,
get a mortgage,

309
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,258
have a car payment,
fly commercial,

310
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,327
start swimming in
credit card debt?

311
00:15:29,329 --> 00:15:32,463
I mean what are
you gonna tell me next,

312
00:15:32,465 --> 00:15:36,100
that ya like drinking
domestic beer?

313
00:15:38,605 --> 00:15:40,204
- I love domestic beer.

314
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:56,154
- Done.

315
00:15:59,025 --> 00:16:02,460
Holy, it's a
bit of a fixer-upper.

316
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:04,462
- Yeah, but it's ours.

317
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:09,299
Well our boxes are made
of 100% recycled material.

318
00:16:09,302 --> 00:16:11,069
No, I can't give you a discount.

319
00:16:11,071 --> 00:16:12,404
What I can do is enroll you

320
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:13,738
in our customer
appreciation program

321
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,074
which does offer
rewards on both orders.

322
00:16:17,077 --> 00:16:18,788
Well I'm sorry to
hear that, sir.

323
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:20,500
But if you happen
to change your mind,

324
00:16:20,501 --> 00:16:22,212
don't hesitate to call back
and ask for cardboard Corey.

325
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:24,482
Ooh.

326
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,919
- Welcome to the team.

327
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,087
- Well let's knock 'em down
and knock 'em back, huh?

328
00:16:31,224 --> 00:16:33,591
Honey, I'm home.
- Taste this.

329
00:16:35,095 --> 00:16:36,094
- Mmm, that's good; what is it?

330
00:16:36,096 --> 00:16:37,746
- Nepalese Momo.

331
00:16:37,747 --> 00:16:39,397
I found them in this amazing
cookbook that I picked up

332
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:40,899
this week and I
couldn't find the Jimbu,

333
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,400
but I think this'll
taste all right.

334
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:43,846
- A what?

335
00:16:43,847 --> 00:16:45,291
- It's a Nepalese dried onion.

336
00:16:45,292 --> 00:16:46,736
I'm testin' for
our dinner party.

337
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,672
- What dinner party?

338
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:48,673
- Corey.
- What?

339
00:16:48,675 --> 00:16:53,244
- We're gonna have a
lot of dinner parties.

340
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:59,684
- God, I hope it stays
like this forever.

341
00:17:07,027 --> 00:17:10,028
And for the cave people, it
did stay like that forever.

342
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:16,467
But unfortunately, well
we ain't livin' in a cave.

343
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:22,340
I thought you were gonna
call and have that fixed.

344
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:27,478
- I thought you were gonna
call and have that fixed.

345
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,287
- No, we don't have
any plastic bins.

346
00:17:36,289 --> 00:17:38,239
We don't have any
metal containers.

347
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,190
We don't sell steel
drums, just boxes.

348
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:44,595
Plain old fucking
cardboard boxes.

349
00:17:45,632 --> 00:17:48,199
- It's all
about personality.

350
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,603
It's all about passion.

351
00:17:55,075 --> 00:17:57,175
It's all about
believing what you sell.

352
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,613
- Look I don't know what you
want me to do here, Rick.

353
00:18:02,615 --> 00:18:04,682
All right?

354
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:06,750
I watched the training video,
I followed the sales manual.

355
00:18:06,751 --> 00:18:08,818
At the end of the day, I
mean they're just boxes.

356
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,156
- No, Corey.

357
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,227
They're not just boxes.

358
00:18:16,229 --> 00:18:19,263
These are containers that move
the treasures of our lives.

359
00:18:20,767 --> 00:18:23,367
- Right, okay.

360
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,369
- Remember our motto,

361
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,874
"Think outside the box."

362
00:18:35,548 --> 00:18:36,497
- Hey, Freddy.

363
00:18:36,498 --> 00:18:37,447
C'mon baby, let's go.

364
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,360
You got this.

365
00:18:38,361 --> 00:18:39,271
Four pins, that's all we need.

366
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:40,182
C'mon.

367
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:45,456
- Loser!
- Woo!

368
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,300
- Hey, what the fuck?

369
00:18:56,302 --> 00:18:57,802
First we lose to Polly's Pies,

370
00:18:57,804 --> 00:19:00,304
then Tim's Auto Body
and now Diana's Floral?

371
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:01,706
I mean what is this?

372
00:19:01,708 --> 00:19:03,691
I don't get it.

373
00:19:03,692 --> 00:19:05,675
Do you even realize that
we are the laughing stock

374
00:19:05,678 --> 00:19:06,844
of this league?

375
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:10,148
Every time you throw a
gutter or miss a spare,

376
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:12,517
you guys just laugh if
off and it's not funny.

377
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,286
I mean I've tried to
help you guys, right?

378
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:17,188
I mean Ted, I bought
you finger grips.

379
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,456
Where the hell they at?

380
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:22,160
Fred, I bought you lessons.

381
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:23,678
Bob.

382
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,195
Bob you know if
anybody was on my side,

383
00:19:25,198 --> 00:19:27,315
I thought it'd be you.

384
00:19:27,316 --> 00:19:29,433
I bought you a wrist guard
and you don't even wear it.

385
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:35,439
- Well why don't you quit?
- No.

386
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,275
Winners don't quit, Ted.

387
00:19:37,277 --> 00:19:38,910
Winners win.

388
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,544
- I honestly don't give
a shit about winning.

389
00:19:40,547 --> 00:19:42,230
- Yeah, man.

390
00:19:42,231 --> 00:19:43,914
Do you know how much shit I
have to deal with at home?

391
00:19:43,917 --> 00:19:46,250
I don't need extra pressure,
I don't want stress.

392
00:19:46,252 --> 00:19:48,886
I come here to drink beers
and catch up with my guys.

393
00:19:51,224 --> 00:19:52,890
- Hey, I forgot
to tell you guys.

394
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:54,792
My dual hood grill
just showed up.

395
00:19:55,562 --> 00:19:56,594
It's incredible.

396
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:01,599
- Oh man, I am so
jealous right now.

397
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,763
- I'm kinda tired.

398
00:20:32,765 --> 00:20:35,366
- Yeah, I'm kinda tired too.

399
00:20:35,935 --> 00:20:37,468
Maybe tomorrow.

400
00:20:38,404 --> 00:20:40,371
- Definitely tomorrow.

401
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,676
- Wow, you were totally right.

402
00:20:45,678 --> 00:20:48,012
This definitely
beats happy hour.

403
00:20:48,014 --> 00:20:49,880
You know serial killers
hang out here, right?

404
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:51,582
- Okay look, you
didn't have to come.

405
00:20:51,584 --> 00:20:53,784
I told you I had to
get the track lighting.

406
00:20:54,921 --> 00:20:56,454
- Listen to yourself.

407
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,722
You've been on like
this Joan of Arc,

408
00:20:57,723 --> 00:20:58,989
mother of misery
routine for a week.

409
00:20:58,992 --> 00:21:00,792
- Here we go.

410
00:21:00,793 --> 00:21:02,593
- I'm just saying I get
why you're depressed.

411
00:21:02,594 --> 00:21:04,394
You get up, go to
work, you come home.

412
00:21:04,397 --> 00:21:06,964
You watch "Dance
Mom" for 12 hours,

413
00:21:06,966 --> 00:21:08,933
then you pass out and
do it all over again.

414
00:21:08,935 --> 00:21:10,802
It's enough to make
anybody miserable.

415
00:21:10,803 --> 00:21:12,670
- If I lied to you and
told you I was miserable,

416
00:21:12,672 --> 00:21:13,725
would that make you stop?

417
00:21:13,726 --> 00:21:14,779
- I don't want you
to be miserable.

418
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,833
I just want you to be that Pam

419
00:21:15,834 --> 00:21:16,887
that I used to know, you know?

420
00:21:16,888 --> 00:21:17,941
The Pam who was like it's
four p.m., who cares?

421
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:21,445
Let's go get drunk or let's
go on a crazy shopping spree

422
00:21:21,447 --> 00:21:23,547
even though we both have no
money in our bank accounts.

423
00:21:23,549 --> 00:21:26,651
The Pam that just had
that like joie de vivre.

424
00:21:26,653 --> 00:21:28,853
- Brianna, I am happy.

425
00:21:28,855 --> 00:21:30,088
Look, you just don't understand

426
00:21:30,089 --> 00:21:31,322
what it's like to be
in a relationship.

427
00:21:31,324 --> 00:21:33,508
There's a lot going on.

428
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:35,693
Corey and I've gotta you know
finish stuff with the house.

429
00:21:35,695 --> 00:21:38,562
We're decorating rooms,
refinishing hardwood,

430
00:21:38,564 --> 00:21:40,298
installing track lighting.

431
00:21:41,501 --> 00:21:43,501
It's a lot.

432
00:21:43,502 --> 00:21:45,502
You know, there's just not
enough time for joie de vivre.

433
00:21:45,505 --> 00:21:47,605
- Okay, well we better make
some time for margaritas

434
00:21:47,607 --> 00:21:49,307
'cause this bitch is craving.

435
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,308
- Okay.

436
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:51,993
- I wish you
would've married James Bond

437
00:21:51,994 --> 00:21:53,677
instead of James Bland.

438
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:54,645
- James Bond?

439
00:21:54,647 --> 00:21:56,814
James Bond, really?

440
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:58,982
'Cause he was an emotionally
unstable womanizing alcoholic.

441
00:21:58,985 --> 00:22:00,718
- Yeah, but that's kinda hot.

442
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:05,089
- Wow, this place is amazing.

443
00:22:05,091 --> 00:22:07,658
How come we've never
hung out here before?

444
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,360
- You're not funny.

445
00:22:09,362 --> 00:22:11,184
- You're wrong.

446
00:22:11,185 --> 00:22:13,007
You see I'm Rodney
fuckin' Dangerfield, man.

447
00:22:13,008 --> 00:22:14,830
I'm tellin' you comedy
is tragedy and this place

448
00:22:15,735 --> 00:22:17,301
is fucking depressing.

449
00:22:17,302 --> 00:22:18,868
- I warned you I had to pick
up a light package, right?

450
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:20,271
You knew what you
were gettin' into.

451
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:21,672
- Yeah, you warned me all right

452
00:22:21,674 --> 00:22:24,408
and all this really excites you.

453
00:22:24,410 --> 00:22:26,877
- Yes, this really excites me.

454
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:30,881
- Damn, you need a vacation.

455
00:22:30,883 --> 00:22:31,882
- What?

456
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:33,618
- A vacation.

457
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,353
A place you can
swim with dolphins,

458
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:39,390
squirrel suit off a cliff,
hovercraft over a lake.

459
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:42,360
I don't know, just
anything to feel your mojo

460
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:47,498
that's so obviously
been neutered by this
suburban insanity.

461
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:50,368
- Yeah well, I'd love to go
to some tropical destination

462
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,503
with warm sunshine and
cold drinks, Smuts.

463
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:53,971
But what problems
does that solve?

464
00:22:58,945 --> 00:23:00,962
Hello.

465
00:23:02,982 --> 00:23:04,415
What the hell, I'm here now.

466
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:06,951
Well why would you
have me come here

467
00:23:06,953 --> 00:23:08,953
if you were gonna get it?

468
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:12,056
Okay.

469
00:23:14,594 --> 00:23:17,528
- You really
do have a lotta problems.

470
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,497
- Spy means nothin'.

471
00:23:19,499 --> 00:23:23,167
- Yeah well, you're
not a spy anymore.

472
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:27,537
- I feel like we should
take a trip somewhere,

473
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,406
get outta here.

474
00:23:28,408 --> 00:23:29,774
- Go where?

475
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,075
- I don't know, anywhere.

476
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:35,713
England, France, Nepal.

477
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,065
- Cool.
- Yeah,

478
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:38,416
instead of reading and
tryin' to replicate,

479
00:23:38,418 --> 00:23:40,101
you know let's go.

480
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:41,785
Boots on the ground, taste
the food, see Mount Everest.

481
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:43,788
Just escape.

482
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:47,491
- I've always wanted
to see Mount Everest.

483
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,126
- Could cash in
some airline miles,

484
00:23:49,128 --> 00:23:51,095
go for a week, just
enough time to recharge.

485
00:23:51,097 --> 00:23:52,830
- Refresh.
- Invigorate.

486
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,167
Just forget about all
our troubles, you know?

487
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:57,134
- What troubles?

488
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,205
- Not troubles, just stresses.

489
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,608
Life's little crosses
we all have to bear.

490
00:24:04,610 --> 00:24:06,227
- Yeah?

491
00:24:06,228 --> 00:24:07,845
But we agreed that we'd
spend money on the house

492
00:24:07,847 --> 00:24:10,214
instead of carelessly
dropping out on vacations.

493
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:11,949
I mean for instance,

494
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,683
we still have to install
the track lighting.

495
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,188
- Yeah, but do we really
want the track lighting?

496
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:19,457
- Of course we want
the track lighting.

497
00:24:19,459 --> 00:24:21,692
It's part of the lighting
package that we picked out.

498
00:24:21,694 --> 00:24:23,494
And if we don't have that,

499
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,029
what is the point of
having this island

500
00:24:25,031 --> 00:24:26,914
in the kitchen
without the island?

501
00:24:26,915 --> 00:24:28,798
Where are we gonna put the
stools that we had pre-ordered?

502
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,235
Without stools, where's
everyone gonna congregate

503
00:24:31,237 --> 00:24:32,478
at the dinner party?

504
00:24:32,479 --> 00:24:33,720
- What dinner party?

505
00:24:33,721 --> 00:24:34,962
- Corey.
- What?

506
00:24:34,963 --> 00:24:36,204
- We're gonna have a
lot of dinner parties.

507
00:24:36,209 --> 00:24:37,208
- We are?

508
00:24:38,678 --> 00:24:39,677
- Yeah.

509
00:25:12,044 --> 00:25:14,178
- What the hell is this?

510
00:25:15,114 --> 00:25:19,016
- This is an intervention.

511
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:20,618
- Hi, Corey.

512
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,654
- An intervention.

513
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:26,156
What the fuck do I need an
intervention for, Smuts?

514
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:28,993
- Listen man, we know
you're miserable.

515
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:30,044
- Miserable?

516
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:31,094
No, I am not miserable.

517
00:25:31,097 --> 00:25:32,663
My life is great.

518
00:25:32,665 --> 00:25:33,864
- We've been watching.

519
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:36,100
Your life sucks.

520
00:25:36,102 --> 00:25:37,735
- You've been spying on me.

521
00:25:37,737 --> 00:25:38,669
- We're spies.

522
00:25:38,671 --> 00:25:39,737
That's what we do.

523
00:25:39,739 --> 00:25:40,771
- Oh my god.

524
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:42,573
- We wouldn't be true spies

525
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:45,042
if we allowed you to
waste away like this.

526
00:25:45,044 --> 00:25:47,011
- Yeah, so you
decided to shoot me.

527
00:25:47,013 --> 00:25:48,279
Great.

528
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,546
- I had to test
the new tranq gun.

529
00:25:53,686 --> 00:25:54,852
- Who the hell is this?

530
00:25:54,854 --> 00:25:56,921
- Remora aka Suckerfish.

531
00:25:56,923 --> 00:25:58,806
Smuts gave me the code name.

532
00:25:58,807 --> 00:26:00,690
After you left, he brought
me into handle the grunt work

533
00:26:00,693 --> 00:26:01,776
he didn't wanna do.

534
00:26:01,777 --> 00:26:02,860
Isn't that right, Smuts?

535
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,963
- Yeah, thanks.

536
00:26:08,334 --> 00:26:10,234
I mean he's my minion basically.

537
00:26:11,804 --> 00:26:14,605
- As much as I
appreciate being dragged

538
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:16,974
all the way down here
and told my life sucks,

539
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,043
you're wrong.

540
00:26:19,045 --> 00:26:20,678
I love my life.

541
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,313
I love that I get to
wake up every morning,

542
00:26:22,315 --> 00:26:23,981
go to work and come home.

543
00:26:23,983 --> 00:26:25,249
No chance of being shot.

544
00:26:25,251 --> 00:26:26,717
No chance of being blown up.

545
00:26:26,719 --> 00:26:28,369
Now call me crazy,

546
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:30,020
but the change is
actually quite refreshing.

547
00:26:34,994 --> 00:26:36,093
Really?

548
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:39,196
- Corey, this is a safe place.

549
00:26:39,198 --> 00:26:41,415
- Why do you keep
talking like that?

550
00:26:41,416 --> 00:26:43,633
- Corey, Smuts and I wanted
to create a circle of trust

551
00:26:43,636 --> 00:26:44,835
so you felt comfortable.

552
00:26:44,837 --> 00:26:45,803
- Corey,

553
00:26:47,139 --> 00:26:49,873
there's somebody we'd
like you to meet.

554
00:26:49,875 --> 00:26:52,276
- Oh, fantastic.

555
00:26:52,278 --> 00:26:54,612
Fine, but then I'm leaving.

556
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:57,982
- Okay, thank you.

557
00:27:12,231 --> 00:27:14,031
- Corey, my name
is Dr. Studebaker

558
00:27:14,033 --> 00:27:15,633
and I have been
doing some analysis

559
00:27:15,635 --> 00:27:19,036
on the field research
I was provided.

560
00:27:19,038 --> 00:27:20,638
I prepared a few images.

561
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,008
Frustration,

562
00:27:25,945 --> 00:27:26,944
anger.

563
00:27:29,915 --> 00:27:30,564
- Big one.

564
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,214
- Denial

565
00:27:34,053 --> 00:27:35,886
and finally, acceptance.

566
00:27:39,325 --> 00:27:42,326
- Bravo, Smuts.

567
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:44,294
You put a few pictures
together, what's the point?

568
00:27:44,296 --> 00:27:46,997
- My point is the reason you
can't settle into suburban life

569
00:27:46,999 --> 00:27:48,766
has nothing to do
with the life itself.

570
00:27:48,768 --> 00:27:50,668
- Oh, well I can
maintain an erection

571
00:27:50,670 --> 00:27:51,802
if that's what
you're gettin' at.

572
00:27:51,804 --> 00:27:53,671
- I know, we have the slides.

573
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,675
Corey, you have
unfinished business.

574
00:27:57,677 --> 00:28:00,277
- What the hell are
you talkin' about?

575
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:02,346
- You failed your last mission

576
00:28:02,348 --> 00:28:05,349
and rather than face your
failure, what did you do?

577
00:28:05,351 --> 00:28:06,717
You ran away.

578
00:28:06,719 --> 00:28:09,987
I believe that failure's
causing these strong emotions

579
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:11,989
of frustration in
your present life

580
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:15,826
and until you succeed
at a final mission,

581
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:17,861
you won't be able to settle into

582
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:20,064
a peaceful and
tranquil existence.

583
00:28:23,102 --> 00:28:24,968
- Well, thank you
very, very much

584
00:28:24,970 --> 00:28:26,470
for the psychobabble bullshit.

585
00:28:26,472 --> 00:28:27,938
But trust me when I tell you

586
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:30,274
my life is perfectly fine, okay?

587
00:28:31,711 --> 00:28:33,110
And the last thing I need
is to chase some lunatic

588
00:28:33,112 --> 00:28:34,712
half way across the globe.

589
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:37,147
- You know, you
wouldn't have to go far.

590
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,248
The mission's here.

591
00:28:39,251 --> 00:28:40,250
Egan's back.

592
00:28:42,888 --> 00:28:44,405
- Great.

593
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:45,923
Then you won't have to go
far to get him, will ya?

594
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:47,791
- Egan recently got married

595
00:28:47,793 --> 00:28:51,061
and is mysteriously
honeymooning here.

596
00:28:51,063 --> 00:28:54,398
We believe he's tryin' to
acquire plans for a weapon

597
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,866
from a local sell.

598
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:08,245
We've arranged for you to come
back for this one mission.

599
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,081
You start tomorrow.

600
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,854
- What the hell don't
you understand, Smuts?

601
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:18,288
I'm just not interested, okay?

602
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,124
- Corey, they're only doing this

603
00:29:20,126 --> 00:29:21,492
because they care about you.

604
00:29:21,494 --> 00:29:22,960
They want to help.

605
00:29:22,962 --> 00:29:25,396
- I don't need their help

606
00:29:25,397 --> 00:29:27,831
and I damn sure don't need
this fucking intervention.

607
00:29:27,833 --> 00:29:28,832
- Okay.

608
00:30:01,934 --> 00:30:03,934
- Lemme guess,

609
00:30:03,936 --> 00:30:05,803
the shrink was right and
you're only doing this

610
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:08,038
so you can settle down
in your married life?

611
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,473
- I hate you.

612
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:10,541
- Welcome back.

613
00:30:14,013 --> 00:30:17,080
- Egan's set to arrive
Friday before noon.

614
00:30:17,082 --> 00:30:20,851
He'll be stayin' in a
suite at the Pines Hotel

615
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:23,821
and unlike your
perfect marriage,

616
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:25,956
we're convinced his is a cover.

617
00:30:25,958 --> 00:30:27,391
- So what's our strategy?

618
00:30:27,393 --> 00:30:29,359
- You're to mirror
his every move.

619
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,196
You've come in town
for your honeymoon

620
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:34,231
and will be stayin'
in adjacent suite

621
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:35,599
with one of our field agents

622
00:30:35,601 --> 00:30:37,234
who's gonna pretend
to be your wife.

623
00:30:37,236 --> 00:30:39,236
- Hold on, hold on.

624
00:30:39,237 --> 00:30:41,237
You want me to pretend to
be married to someone else?

625
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,890
- Yeah.

626
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:44,541
- This
is the best you guys

627
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:46,009
could come up with?

628
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,580
Wow you didn't drag me all
the way down here for this

629
00:30:49,582 --> 00:30:50,547
did you, Smuts?

630
00:30:52,184 --> 00:30:53,851
- Smuts has had me
prepare the research

631
00:30:53,853 --> 00:30:56,070
and all of our modeling confirms

632
00:30:56,071 --> 00:30:58,288
that pretending to be married
gives us the greatest access.

633
00:31:00,125 --> 00:31:02,109
- Relax, Corey.

634
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:04,094
You can still clip
coupons, trim hedges

635
00:31:04,096 --> 00:31:06,864
and come home to
Pam every night.

636
00:31:06,866 --> 00:31:09,900
I just need you to bond
with Egan and his Mrs.

637
00:31:09,902 --> 00:31:14,538
and get the plans for a weapon
that could wipe us all out.

638
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:17,074
We don't know what it is.

639
00:31:17,075 --> 00:31:19,609
It could be a laser, it
could be an atom bomb.

640
00:31:19,612 --> 00:31:21,512
I don't know.

641
00:31:21,513 --> 00:31:23,413
I just know that
lives are at risk!

642
00:31:23,415 --> 00:31:26,450
Are you willing to have
blood on your hands

643
00:31:26,452 --> 00:31:29,353
because you're married
all of a sudden?!

644
00:31:32,324 --> 00:31:33,957
That's on you, brother.

645
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,680
- All right.

646
00:31:39,681 --> 00:31:42,465
Fine I'll do it, but I'm
only doin' it for Pat.

647
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:49,339
- Once you befriend
Egan and his new bride,

648
00:31:49,341 --> 00:31:52,309
you should be close
enough to use this.

649
00:32:11,163 --> 00:32:13,196
- Smuts told me to play around
in a lab for a few weeks

650
00:32:13,198 --> 00:32:15,332
and I came up with this.

651
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:16,934
It's actually a
visual lie detector.

652
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:17,818
See these buttons?

653
00:32:17,819 --> 00:32:18,701
Itty-bitty cameras.

654
00:32:18,704 --> 00:32:20,237
When you speak directly to Egan,

655
00:32:20,239 --> 00:32:21,928
it'll scan his face,

656
00:32:21,929 --> 00:32:23,618
send that information
back to these monitors

657
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:25,308
where we can determine
if he's lying or not.

658
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,177
- And we're sure this works.

659
00:32:27,179 --> 00:32:30,514
- Corey, you ever think
about leaving Pam?

660
00:32:30,516 --> 00:32:33,150
- No, absolutely not.

661
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,086
- It works.

662
00:32:36,088 --> 00:32:39,990
Let's make sure to fully
weaponize Corey's house

663
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:42,576
for his own protection.

664
00:32:42,577 --> 00:32:45,161
Oh and since you're back, we'll
go ahead and pick up the tab

665
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,631
on your domestic beers.

666
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,209
- Smuts, I'm on-site.

667
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:00,471
The preventative
security measures

668
00:33:00,472 --> 00:33:01,732
are ready to be installed.

669
00:33:01,733 --> 00:33:02,993
You can count on me.

670
00:33:02,994 --> 00:33:04,254
I'm takin' care of business,
doing it by the book:

671
00:33:04,255 --> 00:33:05,515
tackling objectives,
checking boxes.

672
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,019
Smuts?

673
00:33:10,756 --> 00:33:12,055
- Where
the hell is Corey?

674
00:33:12,691 --> 00:33:14,975
- He wanted me to tell you

675
00:33:14,976 --> 00:33:17,260
that he has set up
several off-site meetings

676
00:33:17,262 --> 00:33:20,397
with potential buyers and that
you should be proud of him

677
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,532
because he's thinkin'
outside of the box.

678
00:33:23,635 --> 00:33:25,385
- All right, get back to work.

679
00:33:25,386 --> 00:33:27,136
A-B-C, always be cardboarding.

680
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:32,376
- Here's your key.

681
00:33:32,377 --> 00:33:34,211
Agent Panzant's
waiting for you inside.

682
00:33:34,213 --> 00:33:36,079
I hear she's hot.

683
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:38,215
- What's your point?

684
00:33:38,216 --> 00:33:40,350
- My point is it's your
job to hook up with her.

685
00:33:40,352 --> 00:33:42,419
- I'm married, remember?

686
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:45,355
I'm only doin' this to
get Egan, find closure.

687
00:33:45,357 --> 00:33:46,656
- Uh-huh.

688
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:48,158
- Trust me.

689
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,659
Once this is over, it's
gonna take my relationship

690
00:33:49,660 --> 00:33:51,160
to a whole other
level, all right?

691
00:33:51,163 --> 00:33:52,162
- Sure.

692
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,498
- Whoa hey, hold up.

693
00:33:55,300 --> 00:33:56,433
You're not comin' in?

694
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:57,634
- Why would I do that?

695
00:33:57,636 --> 00:34:01,171
- I don't know, we just
always worked together.

696
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,739
- Right.

697
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:06,376
Oh my gosh.

698
00:34:07,146 --> 00:34:09,713
Oh my gosh!

699
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:13,450
You're afraid to be alone
in a room with a hot girl.

700
00:34:13,452 --> 00:34:17,354
What, are you afraid you're
gonna give into the temptations

701
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,522
on the other side of that door?

702
00:34:18,524 --> 00:34:19,990
- All right, all right.

703
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:21,457
- Like a real therapy session

704
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:24,127
where you're just takin'
out your daily aggressions.

705
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:26,413
- Is that how you do it?
- Then when it's all done,

706
00:34:26,414 --> 00:34:28,698
you guys just lay in like a
kiddie pool of your own sweat

707
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:33,336
in the middle of the bed
exhausted, but feelin' good.

708
00:34:33,338 --> 00:34:35,338
Secret is safe with me, dude.

709
00:34:36,341 --> 00:34:37,607
Spy's honor.

710
00:34:40,112 --> 00:34:41,278
- You're an idiot.

711
00:34:47,653 --> 00:34:48,969
- I hope you don't mind.

712
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,286
I'm a sort of a method spy.

713
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:53,824
- Method spy, huh?

714
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:55,358
- You know, like
a method actress.

715
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,761
I have to live it to be it.

716
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:00,147
- Right.
- And to be honest,

717
00:35:00,148 --> 00:35:02,532
our whole relationship,
our marriage,

718
00:35:05,504 --> 00:35:07,571
I'm just not really feeling it.

719
00:35:07,573 --> 00:35:11,741
- Feeling what?
- Us, together as a couple.

720
00:35:11,743 --> 00:35:13,243
I mean, think about it.

721
00:35:13,245 --> 00:35:14,711
Would someone like
me ever actually

722
00:35:14,713 --> 00:35:16,179
be attracted to
someone like you?

723
00:35:16,181 --> 00:35:17,747
- Oh okay, I see.

724
00:35:17,749 --> 00:35:19,583
Then how do you
know someone like me

725
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:21,418
would be attracted
to someone like you?

726
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:24,855
- 'Cause you look married.

727
00:35:28,527 --> 00:35:30,828
- Okay.

728
00:35:30,829 --> 00:35:33,130
¶ Please don't give up on me ¶

729
00:35:33,132 --> 00:35:34,831
¶ I know that ¶

730
00:35:40,139 --> 00:35:41,439
- Where are you?

731
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,740
Is everything okay?

732
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,041
- Everything's fine.

733
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,342
Everything's fine.

734
00:35:45,343 --> 00:35:46,643
I got a ton of work to do
so don't wait up, okay?

735
00:36:17,176 --> 00:36:18,642
- This is much better.

736
00:36:18,644 --> 00:36:22,379
- I'm not agreeing, but
I'm not disagreeing.

737
00:36:22,381 --> 00:36:24,114
- I totally think we should
be one of those couples

738
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:25,848
who just can't keep their
hands off each other.

739
00:36:27,252 --> 00:36:29,386
See you at nine tomorrow.

740
00:36:29,388 --> 00:36:31,521
- Yeah, see you at nine.

741
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:34,591
Smuts, fill me in.

742
00:36:34,593 --> 00:36:35,559
Gimme the details.

743
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:36,526
What's the skinny?

744
00:36:37,930 --> 00:36:40,730
- I had to buy 50k
in boxes from Corey,

745
00:36:40,732 --> 00:36:42,966
so his boss wouldn't
get suspicious.

746
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:44,284
- Got it.

747
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:45,601
Did you consider spacing
out the deliveries

748
00:36:45,604 --> 00:36:46,836
to make it look more legitimate?

749
00:36:46,838 --> 00:36:48,205
Just an idea.

750
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:49,839
You wanna grab a
beer after this?

751
00:36:52,611 --> 00:36:53,610
Smuts?

752
00:36:56,615 --> 00:36:58,949
- Corey?
- You're still up.

753
00:36:58,951 --> 00:37:00,483
- Yeah, I couldn't sleep.

754
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:04,838
What?!

755
00:37:04,839 --> 00:37:05,888
- What, what's goin' on?

756
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:08,558
- Your hair.

757
00:37:11,563 --> 00:37:13,763
- Oh yeah, got it cut.

758
00:37:13,765 --> 00:37:15,765
Just thought a little
style couldn't hurt.

759
00:37:15,767 --> 00:37:17,834
- But it's kinda ridiculous.

760
00:37:19,338 --> 00:37:21,104
- All right, so maybe she
went a little overboard.

761
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:22,871
I don't see why you have
to freak out about it.

762
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:23,740
- I'm not freaking out.

763
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:24,975
- A little bit.

764
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:26,432
- Okay, I am.

765
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:27,888
But if I suddenly came home

766
00:37:27,889 --> 00:37:29,344
with some weird and crazy
hairdo, you'd freak out too.

767
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:31,070
- You did.

768
00:37:31,071 --> 00:37:32,793
You cut your hair short.

769
00:37:32,794 --> 00:37:34,516
- Okay wait, you're saying
you don't like my hair?

770
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:36,953
- What?

771
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,487
- When I came home with it cut,
you said you loved my hair.

772
00:37:38,488 --> 00:37:40,021
- What was I
supposed to say, Pam?

773
00:37:40,022 --> 00:37:41,555
Wow honey, did you
just join the Marines?

774
00:37:42,361 --> 00:37:43,660
- Oh okay, I'm sorry.

775
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:44,960
I didn't realize
that our relationship

776
00:37:44,963 --> 00:37:48,031
was one based on looks alone.

777
00:37:48,033 --> 00:37:48,932
- You know what
I'm tryin' to say.

778
00:37:48,934 --> 00:37:50,267
- No, I don't.

779
00:37:52,271 --> 00:37:53,937
Something else you
haven't told me yet?

780
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,940
- No.

781
00:37:57,943 --> 00:37:59,676
- What is going on?!

782
00:37:59,678 --> 00:38:00,844
- What's goin' on?

783
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:02,412
What's wrong?

784
00:38:02,414 --> 00:38:03,713
- Your chest.

785
00:38:06,018 --> 00:38:08,551
- Oh yeah, I used a little
men's hair body removal cream.

786
00:38:08,553 --> 00:38:09,986
What's the big deal?
- Oh my god.

787
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,921
- What?
- Nothing, it's just

788
00:38:14,526 --> 00:38:16,593
you call me to tell me
that you're working late

789
00:38:16,595 --> 00:38:19,996
and little did I know that you
were on your way to the spa,

790
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,965
turning yourself
into a metrosexual.

791
00:38:26,705 --> 00:38:29,773
Everything just seems a little
bit suspicious, that's all.

792
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:32,709
- Nothing is going on

793
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:34,410
that needs to make
you suspicious, okay?

794
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:55,932
- What was that?

795
00:38:57,736 --> 00:38:59,903
- Just somethin' else
I'm gonna have to fix.

796
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:05,725
- Oh god, it's not happening.

797
00:39:05,726 --> 00:39:06,875
It can't be happening.

798
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:08,695
Oh, it's happening.

799
00:39:08,696 --> 00:39:09,745
He's having an affair.

800
00:39:11,616 --> 00:39:13,616
- Well fuckin' duh, dude.

801
00:39:13,618 --> 00:39:15,135
God, it'd be so much easier

802
00:39:15,136 --> 00:39:16,653
if his ass didn't
look so good in jeans.

803
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:18,355
- I mean where the
fuck did it go wrong?

804
00:39:18,357 --> 00:39:19,656
- Where did it go wrong?

805
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:21,008
I mean come on, look at the guy.

806
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:22,359
He sells fuckin'
boxes for a living.

807
00:39:22,361 --> 00:39:23,702
He's desperate.

808
00:39:23,703 --> 00:39:25,044
Of course he's gonna fall
for some firm ass model

809
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:26,386
who lives for
alcohol and orgasms.

810
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:27,728
He probably shocked
he could get her.

811
00:39:27,733 --> 00:39:29,116
I mean, I was shocked.

812
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,500
Come on, can you believe it?

813
00:39:32,371 --> 00:39:33,770
- But what should I do?

814
00:39:34,940 --> 00:39:36,573
You know, do I steal his phone?

815
00:39:36,575 --> 00:39:37,730
- Yes.

816
00:39:37,731 --> 00:39:38,886
- Hack into his email?
- Fuck yeah.

817
00:39:38,887 --> 00:39:40,042
- I can't just spy on the guy.

818
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,411
- Oh, yes you can.

819
00:39:42,447 --> 00:39:43,113
- Really?

820
00:39:43,115 --> 00:39:44,047
But I can't.

821
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:44,980
- You can.
- I shouldn't.

822
00:39:44,983 --> 00:39:46,183
- You should.

823
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,384
- What am I even talking about?

824
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:48,585
I'm driving myself crazy.

825
00:39:48,587 --> 00:39:50,203
- It's okay.

826
00:39:50,204 --> 00:39:51,820
It's okay to go crazy
'cause he's a dick, okay?

827
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:53,656
And dicks make bitches crazy.

828
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,626
Look at me, you
need to spy on him.

829
00:39:56,628 --> 00:39:58,061
That way you can catch
him in the motel,

830
00:39:58,063 --> 00:39:59,529
you can kick down the door

831
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:00,996
and kick that collegiate
nympho to the curb.

832
00:40:00,997 --> 00:40:02,463
I'll be there and I'll be
videotaping everything.

833
00:40:02,464 --> 00:40:03,930
We'll put it on YouTube,
we'll get a ton of views.

834
00:40:03,935 --> 00:40:04,934
It'll be great.

835
00:40:17,482 --> 00:40:19,082
- The sound's drivin' me wild.

836
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:22,685
- Are we really gonna sit here

837
00:40:22,687 --> 00:40:24,487
and listen to this shit all day?

838
00:40:26,158 --> 00:40:30,460
- Trust me, I've done a lotta
sex stakeouts in my day.

839
00:40:30,462 --> 00:40:31,928
Either Egan's a really good spy

840
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,531
or homeboy's really fuckin'.

841
00:40:43,041 --> 00:40:44,073
Get the camera.
- Excuse me.

842
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,909
- Told you I'm method.

843
00:40:45,911 --> 00:40:47,811
My character's in the mood.

844
00:40:47,812 --> 00:40:49,712
- All right, I am not
method and my character--

845
00:40:50,916 --> 00:40:52,749
- Actually this is a
really bad angle for you.

846
00:40:52,751 --> 00:40:55,151
Can you just crane your
neck to left a little bit?

847
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:56,503
- What the hell are you doin'?

848
00:40:56,504 --> 00:40:57,854
- Huh?
- You better not be gentle.

849
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,789
- C'mon, man.

850
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,723
This is for my Christmas
party blooper reel.

851
00:41:01,726 --> 00:41:03,860
Remember that footage I
got of you and Graciela

852
00:41:03,862 --> 00:41:04,915
from two years ago?

853
00:41:04,916 --> 00:41:05,969
- Smuts, how many times
do I have to tell you

854
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:07,023
that I am fuckin' married?

855
00:41:07,024 --> 00:41:08,077
- Personally, I think
open relationships

856
00:41:08,078 --> 00:41:09,131
are quite progressive.

857
00:41:09,134 --> 00:41:12,602
- Wow you're a real
freak, aren't you?

858
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:14,771
Just shut up and point
the camera, all right?

859
00:41:14,773 --> 00:41:16,873
Now if you could just
get a little closer,

860
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,608
make it feel real.

861
00:41:19,878 --> 00:41:21,511
- Hello?

862
00:41:21,513 --> 00:41:23,046
Hey, baby.

863
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:24,580
- No no no, we'll never
use any of this wife stuff.

864
00:41:24,583 --> 00:41:25,615
It's not that kind of a movie.

865
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:27,284
- What am I up to?

866
00:41:27,285 --> 00:41:28,952
Just bangin' lots of boxes.

867
00:41:28,954 --> 00:41:30,220
- There we go.

868
00:41:30,221 --> 00:41:31,487
- No no no no, do not do that.

869
00:41:31,490 --> 00:41:33,068
Do not do that.

870
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:34,647
I will do it in 15
minutes and I'll be there.

871
00:41:34,648 --> 00:41:36,226
- Just bring it down
a little bit please.

872
00:41:36,228 --> 00:41:37,827
- Okay, bye.

873
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:41,030
Listen as much fun as
this is, I have to go.

874
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,165
- Now?
- Now?

875
00:41:42,167 --> 00:41:43,417
- Yeah, now.

876
00:41:43,418 --> 00:41:44,668
You're the one who told me

877
00:41:44,669 --> 00:41:45,919
not to let Pam get
suspicious, remember?

878
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,170
- You
totally killed it.

879
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,538
- Well Smuts can fill in.

880
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,606
Have a blast.

881
00:41:49,608 --> 00:41:50,624
- You can't leave.

882
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:51,641
We're in the middle
of a mission.

883
00:41:51,643 --> 00:41:52,909
- So am I.

884
00:41:52,911 --> 00:41:54,911
It's called savin' my marriage.

885
00:41:54,913 --> 00:41:58,915
- Sound like a mission
impossible, right?

886
00:42:17,802 --> 00:42:19,969
- What, that's stainless.

887
00:42:19,971 --> 00:42:21,804
Thought we talked
about brushed nickel.

888
00:42:21,806 --> 00:42:24,541
- Oh, well we changed our mind.

889
00:42:25,677 --> 00:42:27,944
- But the brushed nickel
goes with the vanity hangers.

890
00:42:27,946 --> 00:42:30,146
- Yeah, I'm changing
the vanity hangers.

891
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:32,682
- So then what's the purpose
of me being here, Pam?

892
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:34,083
- I wanted your input.

893
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:04,347
- Get here.

894
00:43:07,686 --> 00:43:09,836
Where's the gun?

895
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,987
Where is it?!

896
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:25,001
- What the hell was that?
- What?

897
00:43:25,003 --> 00:43:27,070
Nothing, gonna be fine.

898
00:43:29,674 --> 00:43:32,141
- Corey, you just had
a guy in a headlock.

899
00:43:32,143 --> 00:43:34,210
- You know it's better to
be safe than sorry, right?

900
00:43:34,212 --> 00:43:35,945
- I mean imagine
if someone we knew

901
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,714
had seen you acting like that.

902
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,283
Never would've come to
one of our dinner parties.

903
00:43:41,286 --> 00:43:42,819
- What dinner parties?

904
00:43:45,624 --> 00:43:46,990
Hey, Rick.

905
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:49,392
- Corey, get your ass
in the office now.

906
00:43:49,394 --> 00:43:51,127
- Okay, I'm on my way.

907
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:55,031
I gotta get back to the
office, I'll see you then?

908
00:43:55,033 --> 00:43:55,999
- Sure.

909
00:43:59,304 --> 00:44:00,770
- Nice hair.

910
00:44:00,772 --> 00:44:01,804
- Nice clothes.

911
00:44:03,642 --> 00:44:05,074
- Nice ass.

912
00:44:05,076 --> 00:44:07,043
- You wanted to
see me there, Rick?

913
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,649
- Cardboard Corey's back.

914
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:16,052
- He is.

915
00:44:16,054 --> 00:44:17,387
- Goin' to Pines Hotel.

916
00:44:17,389 --> 00:44:19,789
Three days, two nights,
all-expense paid.

917
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:21,791
- Boy, the Pines.

918
00:44:22,661 --> 00:44:24,394
I don't know what to say.

919
00:44:24,396 --> 00:44:25,928
- You think you're shocked.

920
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:27,347
- I couldn't believe it

921
00:44:27,348 --> 00:44:28,765
when that 10,000 box
order came through.

922
00:44:28,767 --> 00:44:30,850
- 10,000.

923
00:44:30,851 --> 00:44:32,934
- You broke the company
record, broke my record.

924
00:44:33,938 --> 00:44:36,072
You damn near broke
the world record.

925
00:44:36,074 --> 00:44:37,707
How'd you do it?

926
00:44:37,709 --> 00:44:39,242
- Oh you know, Rick.

927
00:44:39,244 --> 00:44:41,227
I just took your advice

928
00:44:41,228 --> 00:44:43,211
and thought
outside the box.

929
00:44:43,214 --> 00:44:45,982
- Mm-hmm, well you're not
gettin' off that easy.

930
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:48,206
- I'm not?

931
00:44:48,207 --> 00:44:49,662
- Starting today, I'm gonna
have the rest of the guys

932
00:44:49,663 --> 00:44:51,118
follow us to your meetings.

933
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,189
You know, see how a real
professional does it.

934
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,357
- Wow Rick, you know.

935
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:57,377
I don't want the
other guys to know.

936
00:44:57,378 --> 00:44:58,828
You know I like to work alone.

937
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:00,096
Just me, you know?

938
00:45:00,097 --> 00:45:01,363
It helps me kinda focus in.

939
00:45:02,367 --> 00:45:04,167
- Takes teamwork to
make a dream work.

940
00:45:07,005 --> 00:45:08,738
You did watch tape two, right?

941
00:45:11,142 --> 00:45:12,175
- Yeah.

942
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,244
- Hey Corey, congrats
on that hotel thing.

943
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:17,730
- Yeah
thanks a lot, Bob.

944
00:45:17,731 --> 00:45:19,214
- I thought I was
gonna win this year.

945
00:45:19,217 --> 00:45:21,851
But 10,000 boxes, huh?

946
00:45:24,856 --> 00:45:26,233
That's somethin'.

947
00:45:26,234 --> 00:45:27,611
- Trust me, it's nothin'.

948
00:45:27,612 --> 00:45:28,989
- Yeah, but I don't
need a five-star suite.

949
00:45:28,993 --> 00:45:31,828
Just another place my wife
wouldn't have sex with me.

950
00:45:33,364 --> 00:45:34,897
- Okay, yeah.

951
00:45:34,899 --> 00:45:36,199
- We'll see you tonight.

952
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,001
- Tonight?
- Bowling, remember?

953
00:45:39,003 --> 00:45:40,336
Got the tournament,
Diana's Floral.

954
00:45:40,338 --> 00:45:41,204
- Shit.

955
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:42,305
Yeah, right.

956
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:43,405
Of course, I'll
see you guys there.

957
00:45:46,411 --> 00:45:48,511
- I told you to be here at 6:03.

958
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:51,013
It's 6:10, where
the hell were you?

959
00:45:51,015 --> 00:45:52,348
- Oh I'm sorry, Smuts.

960
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:54,283
Before your little intervention,

961
00:45:54,285 --> 00:45:57,286
I had something called a
life that I had to deal with.

962
00:45:57,288 --> 00:45:59,155
- I always just
called it pitiful.

963
00:45:59,157 --> 00:46:00,423
- How tight are these?

964
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:04,644
Well it's funny you say that

965
00:46:04,645 --> 00:46:06,295
because this whole time I've
been dealin' with the fact

966
00:46:06,297 --> 00:46:11,434
that you bought 10,000
boxes from me in one day.

967
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:13,937
What happened to the fact that
I told you to space it out,

968
00:46:13,938 --> 00:46:15,004
you know make it look legit?

969
00:46:15,006 --> 00:46:16,406
- What'd you expect me to do,

970
00:46:16,407 --> 00:46:17,807
go in and fill out
a form every day?

971
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:18,941
I'm not gonna waste my time.

972
00:46:18,943 --> 00:46:20,443
I've got things to do.

973
00:46:20,445 --> 00:46:22,095
- Things to do.

974
00:46:22,096 --> 00:46:23,746
Oh, that's great.

975
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,397
Well just so you
know thanks to you,

976
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:27,048
now I'm dealing with heat
from home, heat from work.

977
00:46:27,051 --> 00:46:28,317
- Actually, I'm in heat.

978
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:31,287
Is that odd?

979
00:46:35,927 --> 00:46:38,461
Actually, I'm in heat.
- Yes.

980
00:46:39,798 --> 00:46:41,431
- Goddammit.

981
00:46:41,432 --> 00:46:43,065
All right, let's get
our head in the game.

982
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:46,335
Claudia and Egan's restaurant
reservation is for seven p.m.

983
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,306
- How come your suit fits?

984
00:46:50,308 --> 00:46:51,507
- Oh, thank you.

985
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:59,215
- He is not even
going to recognize you.

986
00:47:08,993 --> 00:47:10,927
- Brianna, I look like a hooker.

987
00:47:10,929 --> 00:47:12,361
I'm supposed to be undercover,

988
00:47:12,363 --> 00:47:14,430
not auditioning for strip clubs.

989
00:47:16,467 --> 00:47:19,468
Look, every year when I wanted
to start my own business,

990
00:47:19,470 --> 00:47:22,905
I would go out and buy
something smart, sophisticated.

991
00:47:22,907 --> 00:47:25,842
Something that says
I mean business.

992
00:47:26,978 --> 00:47:28,144
So this is me.

993
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:31,514
I'm finally saying
I mean business.

994
00:47:31,516 --> 00:47:33,416
- I love it.

995
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,317
You just need to hire my
lip girl and you're done.

996
00:47:36,287 --> 00:47:38,120
- God, who am I kidding?

997
00:47:38,122 --> 00:47:39,055
I can't do this.

998
00:47:39,056 --> 00:47:39,989
I don't want to do this.

999
00:47:40,625 --> 00:47:42,525
This is not who I am.

1000
00:47:42,527 --> 00:47:45,361
- Pam, you listen to me, okay?

1001
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,463
You need to reclaim yourself.

1002
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:50,266
You are a sexy, wild bitch.

1003
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:54,103
- That would be embarrassing.

1004
00:47:54,105 --> 00:47:56,639
Some risks aren't worth taking.

1005
00:48:01,512 --> 00:48:03,012
- You see 'em?

1006
00:48:03,014 --> 00:48:04,280
- Oh you mean the sexy couple

1007
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:05,547
that's actually
having a good time?

1008
00:48:13,892 --> 00:48:15,075
Vodka, meat.
- Club soda.

1009
00:48:15,076 --> 00:48:16,259
- He'll have a martini.

1010
00:48:16,261 --> 00:48:18,427
- Club soda.
- Straight up with a twist.

1011
00:48:21,266 --> 00:48:23,432
- What are you doin'?

1012
00:48:23,434 --> 00:48:24,951
- What are you doing?

1013
00:48:24,952 --> 00:48:26,469
You know, you should be
believable as my husband.

1014
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:28,221
- Believable?

1015
00:48:28,222 --> 00:48:29,972
Let's not forget I'm the
one who's married here.

1016
00:48:29,974 --> 00:48:31,685
- Oh please.

1017
00:48:31,686 --> 00:48:33,397
Another big night
for you at home

1018
00:48:33,398 --> 00:48:35,109
is probably watching reruns
and eating leftovers,

1019
00:48:35,113 --> 00:48:36,479
but our marriage is not stuck

1020
00:48:36,481 --> 00:48:38,147
on opposite sides of the bed.

1021
00:48:38,149 --> 00:48:39,649
- Oh trust me, darling.

1022
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,150
My marriage happens
all over the bed.

1023
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:46,389
- Thank you.

1024
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:48,524
Cheers.

1025
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:55,598
Okay, big picture.

1026
00:48:55,600 --> 00:48:56,999
We need to connect with Egan,

1027
00:48:57,001 --> 00:48:58,601
so you need to connect with me.

1028
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,670
So drink up, look at me
like you wanna fuck me

1029
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:02,972
and check your baggage
with the bellhop.

1030
00:49:03,975 --> 00:49:05,642
- What baggage?

1031
00:49:05,643 --> 00:49:07,310
- What do you
mean, what baggage?

1032
00:49:07,311 --> 00:49:08,978
Remember Corey, this
is your intervention.

1033
00:49:10,214 --> 00:49:12,148
- You knew about that.

1034
00:49:17,956 --> 00:49:19,288
- Has anyone considered
they might actually

1035
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,090
just be here on their honeymoon?

1036
00:49:23,594 --> 00:49:25,461
- No chance.

1037
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:27,329
Everything they do is
too connected, forced.

1038
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,368
Trust me, that's not
what married people do.

1039
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:34,103
- Ooh.

1040
00:49:46,517 --> 00:49:48,017
- What are you doin'?

1041
00:49:48,019 --> 00:49:49,018
- What?

1042
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:51,988
Should I stop?

1043
00:49:55,059 --> 00:49:58,627
Is it bad?

1044
00:49:58,629 --> 00:49:59,628
Huh?

1045
00:50:01,699 --> 00:50:05,301
Is it not what
married people do?

1046
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:08,504
- Alex, sit down.

1047
00:50:08,506 --> 00:50:10,106
- Why?

1048
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:12,408
- Because you're
drawing attention.

1049
00:50:12,410 --> 00:50:13,509
- Really?
- Yeah.

1050
00:50:14,278 --> 00:50:15,511
- Who's looking at me?

1051
00:50:17,382 --> 00:50:18,681
Are the waiters watching?

1052
00:50:19,484 --> 00:50:20,750
What about Egan?

1053
00:50:22,286 --> 00:50:23,586
Is he watching?

1054
00:50:25,056 --> 00:50:26,789
What about you?

1055
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:28,557
Are you watching?

1056
00:50:28,559 --> 00:50:30,159
- You're gonna blow this.

1057
00:50:30,161 --> 00:50:31,160
- Oh, you.

1058
00:51:36,828 --> 00:51:39,162
Get up.

1059
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,096
I'm sorry I borrowed
your husband,

1060
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,663
but this place
was a little dead.

1061
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:50,825
- Are you kidding?

1062
00:52:50,826 --> 00:52:52,051
That was the most fun
we've had on our honeymoon.

1063
00:52:52,052 --> 00:52:53,277
- Wait, you're on
your honeymoon?

1064
00:52:53,278 --> 00:52:54,503
We're on our honeymoon.

1065
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:55,838
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1066
00:52:55,840 --> 00:52:58,841
- Shut up.
- Oh, I love you.

1067
00:52:58,843 --> 00:53:01,343
Hopefully we'll see
you guys some more.

1068
00:53:01,345 --> 00:53:03,846
- Well we're gonna be
hanging by the pool tomorrow.

1069
00:53:03,848 --> 00:53:05,481
Just drop on by.

1070
00:53:05,483 --> 00:53:06,849
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1071
00:53:06,850 --> 00:53:08,216
- I hope you don't
mind if we turn in.

1072
00:53:08,217 --> 00:53:09,583
I just got super tired.

1073
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:14,323
- Bye.

1074
00:53:19,463 --> 00:53:22,464
Okay, so now we have a pool
date with them tomorrow.

1075
00:53:22,466 --> 00:53:24,767
I guess you convinced
them you wanna fuck me.

1076
00:53:27,238 --> 00:53:28,504
- Shit, I gotta go.

1077
00:53:28,506 --> 00:53:30,272
- Go where?!

1078
00:53:30,274 --> 00:53:33,676
- Bowling tournament.
- Pfft.

1079
00:53:35,880 --> 00:53:38,380
- You guys shoulda seen
this Home & Garden Show.

1080
00:53:38,382 --> 00:53:40,282
Took up the entire Civic Center.

1081
00:53:40,284 --> 00:53:44,620
I mean they had pools,
tubs, lawn care, everything.

1082
00:53:44,622 --> 00:53:46,455
I even won a raffle.

1083
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:47,756
- What'd you win?

1084
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:50,292
- Leaf blower, a good one too.

1085
00:53:50,294 --> 00:53:51,894
- Nice.
- No shit.

1086
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,495
- You're excited about
a leaf blower, Bob?

1087
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:55,965
- And you'll be too.

1088
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:57,633
Come fall all those
trees in your yard,

1089
00:53:57,635 --> 00:53:59,902
you're gonna be beggin'
me to borrow it.

1090
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:02,805
- No, I just mean
there's gotta be more

1091
00:54:02,807 --> 00:54:04,873
to get excited about, right?

1092
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:07,543
Leaf blowers and goddamn
home shows, is that it?

1093
00:54:08,379 --> 00:54:10,246
- It's an acquired appreciation.

1094
00:54:11,249 --> 00:54:14,350
- Look, all I'm sayin'
is you guys even notice

1095
00:54:14,352 --> 00:54:16,552
that all we ever talk
about is the yard

1096
00:54:16,554 --> 00:54:19,488
or adding a deck or
buying a new grill?

1097
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:22,908
There's got to be more to life

1098
00:54:22,909 --> 00:54:24,926
than the fuckin' hardware
store, am I right?

1099
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,048
- No, not really.

1100
00:54:29,049 --> 00:54:30,499
The only thing that
excited me last year

1101
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,635
was when I put a
kegerator in my garage.

1102
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:34,003
- That was awesome.

1103
00:54:37,275 --> 00:54:40,442
- So you're tellin' me that
this is all there is to life?

1104
00:54:40,444 --> 00:54:43,712
What we're livin' right
here, right now, this is it?

1105
00:54:44,715 --> 00:54:46,548
- Yeah, how hard is it?

1106
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:48,267
You get married.

1107
00:54:48,268 --> 00:54:49,985
You watch each other
go to complete hell.

1108
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:52,688
Have a kid maybe
two, stop having sex.

1109
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:54,990
Save for retirement, get
the golden handshake.

1110
00:54:54,992 --> 00:54:57,026
Play golf on the weekends.

1111
00:54:57,027 --> 00:54:59,061
Take a dick pill, realize
that was a mistake.

1112
00:54:59,063 --> 00:55:00,996
Pick out where you want
your ashes scattered,

1113
00:55:00,998 --> 00:55:04,533
leave everything to the
kids and hopefully you know,

1114
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:06,769
a lotta people show
up at your funeral.

1115
00:55:06,771 --> 00:55:08,671
- I'll come to
your funeral, Fred.

1116
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:11,657
- Thanks, Ted.

1117
00:55:11,658 --> 00:55:13,875
- Corey, it's not like
there's some grand adventure

1118
00:55:13,878 --> 00:55:15,778
out there waiting for us.

1119
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:20,749
We're just livin' life
like everyone else.

1120
00:55:21,986 --> 00:55:23,719
- And you guys are
okay with that?

1121
00:55:27,091 --> 00:55:28,457
- Yeah.

1122
00:55:29,060 --> 00:55:30,459
- Aren't you?

1123
00:55:33,397 --> 00:55:35,331
- Yeah, 'course I am.

1124
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:48,744
- You're home late.

1125
00:55:49,613 --> 00:55:50,612
- I had bowling.

1126
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:52,681
- Really?

1127
00:55:52,683 --> 00:55:54,383
Then why were there two messages

1128
00:55:54,384 --> 00:55:56,084
from the guys wondering
where you were?

1129
00:55:56,085 --> 00:55:57,785
- Well I showed up late
'cause I had to work late.

1130
00:55:57,788 --> 00:55:59,021
Big day at the office.

1131
00:55:59,023 --> 00:56:01,891
- Another one?

1132
00:56:01,892 --> 00:56:04,760
- Actually, I won
the all-expense paid
resorts vcation.

1133
00:56:08,366 --> 00:56:09,832
- Well then let's go.

1134
00:56:09,834 --> 00:56:11,633
- Wait, you wanna go?

1135
00:56:11,635 --> 00:56:13,836
- Yes, let's go this weekend.

1136
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:15,604
- No, I can't.

1137
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,005
- You can't what?

1138
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:18,574
You were the one
that wanted to take

1139
00:56:18,575 --> 00:56:20,142
a spur-of-the-moment
trip, why not do it?

1140
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:23,529
- Because I can't, Pam.

1141
00:56:23,530 --> 00:56:24,679
You know, all right?

1142
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:25,829
I mean plus, I thought
we were gonna do stuff

1143
00:56:25,830 --> 00:56:26,979
around the house.
- Like what?

1144
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:30,018
- Track lighting.

1145
00:56:30,020 --> 00:56:31,653
- Are you mocking me?

1146
00:56:33,023 --> 00:56:34,123
- Are you mocking me?

1147
00:56:34,925 --> 00:56:35,924
- Are you drunk?

1148
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:39,278
- I'm not drunk, Pam.

1149
00:56:39,279 --> 00:56:41,396
I had a few martinis
and a couple of beers.

1150
00:56:42,633 --> 00:56:44,149
- What's gotten into you?
- What's gotten into you?

1151
00:56:44,150 --> 00:56:45,666
- I just wanna do
something different.

1152
00:56:45,669 --> 00:56:47,503
- And I just wanna
lay on the couch.

1153
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:50,005
- Fine.

1154
00:56:53,411 --> 00:56:54,443
What was that for?

1155
00:56:54,445 --> 00:56:55,511
- The couch.

1156
00:56:55,513 --> 00:56:56,512
Goodnight.

1157
00:57:10,461 --> 00:57:14,163
- Blissfully committed
to their simple routine,

1158
00:57:14,165 --> 00:57:17,032
the cave people never felt
the need to seek excitement

1159
00:57:17,034 --> 00:57:18,667
from the outside world.

1160
00:57:20,571 --> 00:57:23,972
Unfortunately for us,
well that outside world

1161
00:57:23,974 --> 00:57:27,109
was quickly unraveling
any sense of routine.

1162
00:57:32,716 --> 00:57:33,949
Morning.

1163
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:40,055
- Morning.

1164
00:57:44,061 --> 00:57:46,462
Operation: Catch
Corey is back on.

1165
00:57:53,137 --> 00:57:54,420
- Rick says
we're all goin'

1166
00:57:54,421 --> 00:57:55,704
on a sales call together.

1167
00:57:57,775 --> 00:57:59,608
- Yeah, lemme just
confirm everything

1168
00:57:59,610 --> 00:58:01,477
and we'll get on outta here.

1169
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:02,478
- Alrighty.

1170
00:58:15,025 --> 00:58:17,159
- Oh, that little sneak.

1171
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,987
- My god, do
you ever wear clothes?

1172
00:58:44,989 --> 00:58:46,489
- Excuse me, what
you're seeing here

1173
00:58:46,490 --> 00:58:47,990
is top-of-the-line
tactical gear.

1174
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:50,225
This spy-kini she's wearing
is completely bulletproof,

1175
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,261
fireproof and waterproof.

1176
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:54,296
- My character sees your
character wearing this.

1177
00:58:56,233 --> 00:58:58,267
Oh I assumed you're small.

1178
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:03,939
- You're tellin' me
these can stop a bullet.

1179
00:59:03,941 --> 00:59:05,207
- Sure.

1180
00:59:05,209 --> 00:59:06,525
- Don't get shot.

1181
00:59:06,526 --> 00:59:07,842
- They're waiting
down by the pool.

1182
00:59:07,845 --> 00:59:08,944
- Yeah, I'm not wearing these.

1183
00:59:08,946 --> 00:59:10,312
- You're gonna have to.

1184
00:59:10,313 --> 00:59:11,679
They've already
stitched the cameras in.

1185
00:59:11,682 --> 00:59:12,681
- Where?

1186
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:20,088
- Here, just put it on.

1187
00:59:23,761 --> 00:59:26,328
- All right, I'll put 'em on.

1188
00:59:28,165 --> 00:59:30,032
But I'm not doin'
it for you guys,

1189
00:59:31,235 --> 00:59:33,635
I'm gonna do it for
the mission, for Pam.

1190
01:00:00,598 --> 01:00:02,931
- Oh hey, how are you guys?

1191
01:00:08,672 --> 01:00:09,805
- I've got a visual.

1192
01:00:13,010 --> 01:00:15,143
- I just feel so stupid.

1193
01:00:15,145 --> 01:00:17,779
I mean here I am
following my own husband

1194
01:00:17,781 --> 01:00:19,147
into a fucking honeymoon suite.

1195
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:20,616
- Oh my god, he's a
frickin' polygamist.

1196
01:00:20,618 --> 01:00:21,934
I knew it.

1197
01:00:21,935 --> 01:00:23,251
Everybody watches a couple
episodes of "Big Love"

1198
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,568
and then they think they
can do whatever they want.

1199
01:00:24,569 --> 01:00:25,885
Sorry honey, we're closed.

1200
01:00:25,889 --> 01:00:26,755
- Oh my god, there they are.

1201
01:00:28,258 --> 01:00:31,326
Oh it would just be so much
easier if she's a mess,

1202
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,817
but she's--
- Pam.

1203
01:00:32,818 --> 01:00:34,307
I do not even
wanna hear what she looks like

1204
01:00:34,308 --> 01:00:35,797
because there is no way in hell

1205
01:00:35,799 --> 01:00:37,299
that she's prettier than you.

1206
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:40,186
All right, tell me
what she looks like.

1207
01:00:40,187 --> 01:00:41,737
- Like some femme
fatale Bond villain

1208
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:43,672
that just graduated from
Harvard with a degree

1209
01:00:43,674 --> 01:00:44,973
in you know fucking up my life.

1210
01:00:44,975 --> 01:00:46,108
- Stop.

1211
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,398
You have to take the reins here.

1212
01:00:47,399 --> 01:00:48,687
You're his wife, okay?

1213
01:00:48,688 --> 01:00:49,976
You cannot let this
other woman win.

1214
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:59,321
- Hey when you got it,
you flaunt it right?

1215
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:06,228
- When we first decided
to honeymoon here,

1216
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,930
so many people were like,
"Well that's different,

1217
01:01:09,933 --> 01:01:11,767
"but it's just so
beautiful here."

1218
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:16,772
- I know, I had never been
to upstate New York before.

1219
01:01:16,774 --> 01:01:18,807
But the moment he proposed,

1220
01:01:18,809 --> 01:01:21,076
he insisted he had
to honeymoon here.

1221
01:01:22,413 --> 01:01:24,046
- I'm at a total loss.

1222
01:01:24,047 --> 01:01:25,680
This is not the
man that I married.

1223
01:01:25,683 --> 01:01:27,082
- You need to go confront him.

1224
01:01:27,084 --> 01:01:28,283
- I can't.
- You can.

1225
01:01:28,285 --> 01:01:29,651
What do you want me to do?

1226
01:01:29,652 --> 01:01:31,018
You want me to drive up there?

1227
01:01:31,019 --> 01:01:32,385
I'll drive up there and I
will cut Corey's dick off.

1228
01:01:32,386 --> 01:01:33,752
I will Lorena Bobbitt
that motherfucker.

1229
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:35,791
I will take his dick and I
will throw it in the forest

1230
01:01:35,793 --> 01:01:36,959
and a little squirrel
will pick it up

1231
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:38,126
and run away and
put it in its nest

1232
01:01:38,128 --> 01:01:39,294
and he'll never have it again.

1233
01:01:39,296 --> 01:01:40,162
He'll be dickless.

1234
01:01:40,164 --> 01:01:41,480
- Brianna.

1235
01:01:41,481 --> 01:01:42,797
- I can cut his nuts
off if that's better.

1236
01:01:42,798 --> 01:01:44,114
If the dick's too much,

1237
01:01:44,115 --> 01:01:45,431
you know I can always
take the balls.

1238
01:01:45,436 --> 01:01:46,947
My grandma used to do it
with the hens all the time.

1239
01:01:46,948 --> 01:01:48,459
- Look, no one's nuts
are being cut off.

1240
01:01:48,460 --> 01:01:49,971
- Well then you
need to go confront him.

1241
01:01:53,077 --> 01:01:55,944
- So why did you decide to
honeymoon in Glens Falls?

1242
01:01:55,946 --> 01:01:57,379
- We've been jet-setting
around the world

1243
01:01:57,381 --> 01:02:00,449
for the last two years
straight for business,

1244
01:02:00,451 --> 01:02:03,752
so we wanted something
quaint and charming,

1245
01:02:03,754 --> 01:02:06,888
a bit out of the
way, off-the-grid.

1246
01:02:11,128 --> 01:02:12,628
- How 'bout you guys?

1247
01:02:12,629 --> 01:02:14,129
What made you select
a place off-the-grid?

1248
01:02:15,332 --> 01:02:16,331
- Same.

1249
01:02:16,333 --> 01:02:19,401
Off-the-grid's the desired
honeymoon destination,

1250
01:02:19,403 --> 01:02:20,802
am I right?

1251
01:02:40,791 --> 01:02:42,124
You know service
is kinda slow here.

1252
01:02:42,126 --> 01:02:43,459
I think I'm gonna go
order from the bar.

1253
01:02:43,460 --> 01:02:44,793
Do you guys want anything?

1254
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:46,127
- Why don't we split a
decent bottle of champagne?

1255
01:02:47,297 --> 01:02:48,296
- Great idea.

1256
01:02:49,833 --> 01:02:51,032
- Little birdie's on the move.

1257
01:02:51,969 --> 01:02:53,869
- That's my birdie.

1258
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,908
- You have something I need.

1259
01:03:23,801 --> 01:03:24,366
- Shit.

1260
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:24,932
- What happened?

1261
01:03:28,272 --> 01:03:29,337
- Can you help me?

1262
01:03:36,346 --> 01:03:37,279
- Almost got it.
- All right, all right.

1263
01:03:37,281 --> 01:03:38,346
That's fine.

1264
01:03:38,348 --> 01:03:39,548
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1265
01:03:45,823 --> 01:03:47,355
- Honey, you're sweating.

1266
01:03:47,357 --> 01:03:48,907
Why don't you take
a dip and cool off?

1267
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,458
- And you should reapply
the sunscreen, sweetheart.

1268
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,260
You're startin' to burn.

1269
01:03:52,262 --> 01:03:53,261
- Fine.

1270
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:58,500
- All right
Corey, play it off.

1271
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:00,402
Don't let Egan suspect anything.

1272
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:16,484
- Mmm, feels so good.

1273
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:23,425
- Do you wanna grab a beer
or something after this?

1274
01:04:23,427 --> 01:04:25,227
- How many times do
I have to tell you?

1275
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:27,362
I don't wanna hang.

1276
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,231
I don't wanna grab a beer.

1277
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,099
We're not gonna watch
the game together.

1278
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:33,134
- Okay, I just see how
cool you and Corey are

1279
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:35,403
and I was hoping that someday
you and I might have that,

1280
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:38,106
be more than just two
guys saving the world.

1281
01:04:38,108 --> 01:04:40,158
- Suckerfish, Corey and I,

1282
01:04:40,159 --> 01:04:42,209
we've been buddies
since we were teens.

1283
01:04:42,212 --> 01:04:45,146
We were recruited together
and we trained together.

1284
01:04:45,148 --> 01:04:49,618
We've spoiled some pretty
crazy plots around the globe.

1285
01:04:49,620 --> 01:04:50,619
I mean,

1286
01:04:54,291 --> 01:04:57,025
you know I'm the only one
that knows Corey's real name?

1287
01:04:58,195 --> 01:04:59,194
- Wow.

1288
01:05:01,198 --> 01:05:04,432
- You and I, we just
don't have that history.

1289
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:08,370
- Yeah you and I don't
have that history yet,

1290
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:09,604
but someday we might.

1291
01:05:09,606 --> 01:05:13,608
- I just don't really
see that happening.

1292
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,580
- Oh shit,
look who's here.

1293
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:23,618
- Aw, shit.

1294
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:30,458
Aw, shit.

1295
01:05:32,229 --> 01:05:33,561
This is bad.

1296
01:05:33,563 --> 01:05:35,163
This is really bad.

1297
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:04,492
- Hey, what's up?
- Oh nothing.

1298
01:06:04,494 --> 01:06:06,228
What's up with you?

1299
01:06:06,229 --> 01:06:07,963
- Is there a reason you
called me three times, Pam?

1300
01:06:07,965 --> 01:06:09,397
I just stepped out of a meeting.

1301
01:06:09,399 --> 01:06:10,632
- Oh, what kind of a meeting?

1302
01:06:10,634 --> 01:06:12,000
- A business meeting.

1303
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,367
- Oh yeah, what were
you talking about?

1304
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:14,669
- Why are you acting like this?

1305
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:15,982
- Acting like what?

1306
01:06:15,983 --> 01:06:17,294
I'm just tryin' to ask
you about your day,

1307
01:06:17,295 --> 01:06:18,606
see if you're doin' all right.

1308
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:20,075
Curious what you're up to.

1309
01:06:20,076 --> 01:06:21,543
- That's why you called?
- Mm-hmm.

1310
01:06:21,545 --> 01:06:22,928
Oh no, actually.

1311
01:06:22,929 --> 01:06:24,312
I need you to drop by the store.

1312
01:06:24,314 --> 01:06:26,381
- What?
- Yeah, it's on your way home.

1313
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:29,417
- Okay fine, just text it to me.

1314
01:06:29,419 --> 01:06:30,618
- Why can't you write it down?

1315
01:06:30,620 --> 01:06:31,619
- Pam.

1316
01:06:34,257 --> 01:06:36,524
Just tell me and
I'll remember, okay?

1317
01:06:36,526 --> 01:06:39,294
- Okay some cinnamon, cardamom,

1318
01:06:39,296 --> 01:06:41,780
semi-sweetened dark chocolate,

1319
01:06:41,781 --> 01:06:44,265
pine nuts, mocha extract,
light syrup, cocoa powder,

1320
01:06:44,267 --> 01:06:47,669
pastry shells and some
 Popsicle sticks.

1321
01:06:47,671 --> 01:06:48,887
- Okay, got it.

1322
01:06:48,888 --> 01:06:50,104
- Okay, now repeat
it back to me.

1323
01:06:50,107 --> 01:06:52,157
- What?

1324
01:06:52,158 --> 01:06:54,208
- Just repeat it,
so I know you know.

1325
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:55,210
- I know what it is, Pam.

1326
01:06:55,212 --> 01:06:56,277
- Then repeat it.

1327
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:02,283
- Popsicle sticks, cinnamon.

1328
01:07:03,754 --> 01:07:06,788
- Some cinnamon, cardamom,
semi-sweetened dark chocolate,

1329
01:07:06,790 --> 01:07:09,391
pine nuts, mocha
extract, cocoa powder,

1330
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:11,292
pastry shells and
Popsicle sticks.

1331
01:07:11,294 --> 01:07:12,427
- Fine.

1332
01:07:12,429 --> 01:07:14,229
- Did you write it down?

1333
01:07:14,231 --> 01:07:16,031
- Pam, I told you I'll remember.

1334
01:07:16,033 --> 01:07:16,698
- Oh really?

1335
01:07:16,700 --> 01:07:18,923
Oh I'm so sorry.

1336
01:07:18,924 --> 01:07:21,147
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

1337
01:07:21,148 --> 01:07:23,371
Here I am rambling on and on
while you're trying to work.

1338
01:07:23,373 --> 01:07:25,707
That's it, you're hard
at work by the pool,

1339
01:07:25,709 --> 01:07:29,110
having some tramp rubbing
sun lotion in your back.

1340
01:07:29,112 --> 01:07:30,378
- Pam?
- What?

1341
01:07:30,380 --> 01:07:31,780
What's the matter?

1342
01:07:31,781 --> 01:07:33,181
You've too many
wives to remember?

1343
01:07:33,183 --> 01:07:35,316
- No Pam, just wait.

1344
01:07:35,318 --> 01:07:36,329
What's with the hat?

1345
01:07:38,355 --> 01:07:39,696
- God.

1346
01:07:39,697 --> 01:07:41,038
Swear to god, we need to put
an restraining order on her.

1347
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:42,380
- Yeah, she can
be a little crazy.

1348
01:07:42,381 --> 01:07:43,722
Maybe I should just check.

1349
01:07:47,631 --> 01:07:49,130
- That's his ex-fiancee.

1350
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:51,533
She's a tad bit delusional.

1351
01:08:01,478 --> 01:08:03,711
- Shit, yeah?

1352
01:08:06,616 --> 01:08:09,184
- I hate making these calls.
- What calls?

1353
01:08:09,186 --> 01:08:10,636
- The ones where
I let people go.

1354
01:08:10,637 --> 01:08:12,087
- What're you
talkin' about, Rick?

1355
01:08:12,089 --> 01:08:13,388
I'm your best salesman, righT?

1356
01:08:13,390 --> 01:08:14,823
I mean I won the free trip.

1357
01:08:14,825 --> 01:08:16,224
My sales are through the roof.

1358
01:08:16,226 --> 01:08:17,859
- T-E-A-M.

1359
01:08:17,861 --> 01:08:20,528
I want team players,
not prima donnas.

1360
01:08:20,530 --> 01:08:22,730
Guys see what you're doin'
and start coppin' attitudes,

1361
01:08:22,732 --> 01:08:24,655
doin' things their way.

1362
01:08:24,656 --> 01:08:26,579
Next thing you know, the
whole company goes to shit

1363
01:08:26,580 --> 01:08:28,503
because you wanna play
the game your way.

1364
01:08:28,505 --> 01:08:30,605
- I mean I think I'm settin'
an example here, Rick.

1365
01:08:30,607 --> 01:08:32,240
You know, raising
the bar a little bit.

1366
01:08:32,242 --> 01:08:34,175
- What bar, what example, huh?

1367
01:08:34,177 --> 01:08:35,493
You just left.

1368
01:08:35,494 --> 01:08:36,810
I don't even know where
the hell you are right now.

1369
01:08:36,811 --> 01:08:38,127
- I went on assignment.
- Bullshit.

1370
01:08:38,128 --> 01:08:39,444
That's what I used
to say to my wife

1371
01:08:39,449 --> 01:08:41,249
when I was fuckin' her sister.

1372
01:08:41,251 --> 01:08:42,283
That's it, Corey.

1373
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:44,419
You're fired.

1374
01:08:44,421 --> 01:08:45,820
- Fuck.

1375
01:08:52,429 --> 01:08:53,862
Pam, you gotta let me explain.

1376
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:56,131
- I would love
to hear your explanation

1377
01:08:56,133 --> 01:08:58,766
or you could just go with
I'm screwing somebody else.

1378
01:08:58,768 --> 01:09:00,401
- I'm not having an affair.

1379
01:09:00,403 --> 01:09:01,369
- I know, I know.

1380
01:09:01,371 --> 01:09:02,960
You married her.

1381
01:09:02,961 --> 01:09:04,550
You're on your honeymoon,
congratufuckinlations.

1382
01:09:04,551 --> 01:09:06,140
- Pam, just listen to me.

1383
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:07,909
Calm down and let
me explain myself.

1384
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:11,146
Who the fuck is that?

1385
01:09:11,815 --> 01:09:12,814
- The dinner party.

1386
01:09:14,417 --> 01:09:15,959
- Dinner party?

1387
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,502
What fucking dinner party, Pam?

1388
01:09:17,503 --> 01:09:19,045
I mean my god, you
keep goin' on and on

1389
01:09:19,046 --> 01:09:20,588
about these dinner
parties that don't exist!

1390
01:09:20,590 --> 01:09:21,556
We bought dishes.

1391
01:09:21,558 --> 01:09:23,191
We bought a bar.

1392
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:24,825
I installed a water feature

1393
01:09:24,826 --> 01:09:26,459
all for these dinner parties
that never seem to happen.

1394
01:09:26,463 --> 01:09:28,196
- I am not canceling
my dinner party

1395
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:31,366
just because you had
some sordid affair.

1396
01:09:31,368 --> 01:09:33,568
- I wasn't cheating.

1397
01:09:36,540 --> 01:09:38,806
All right look, I'm gonna tell
'em that we made a mistake

1398
01:09:38,808 --> 01:09:40,175
and we'll do this another night.

1399
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:41,176
- No!

1400
01:09:41,711 --> 01:09:43,378
No no, no you won't.

1401
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:45,346
You are not ruining
my dinner party

1402
01:09:45,348 --> 01:09:47,248
just because our
marriage is over.

1403
01:09:54,658 --> 01:09:55,957
- Hey, everybody.

1404
01:10:00,197 --> 01:10:01,696
- Is this one of them
swingers parties?

1405
01:10:01,698 --> 01:10:04,332
'Cause we didn't
bring any rubbers.

1406
01:10:04,334 --> 01:10:05,900
- We
just thought that

1407
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:07,552
it would be fine for tonight.

1408
01:10:07,553 --> 01:10:09,203
- Just would be fun to
get dressed up because--

1409
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,206
- Yeah, well we wanted
tonight to be a--

1410
01:10:11,208 --> 01:10:12,740
- It's a theme party.
- Yeah.

1411
01:10:14,611 --> 01:10:16,244
- What kinda theme?

1412
01:10:16,245 --> 01:10:17,878
- A spy theme dinner, Bob.
- Yes, exactly.

1413
01:10:17,881 --> 01:10:20,548
You see 007 just
got outta the pool.

1414
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,461
- And Agent 99 here

1415
01:10:22,462 --> 01:10:24,373
was just about to
make some drinks.

1416
01:10:24,374 --> 01:10:26,285
- I've got martinis;
shaken, not stirred.

1417
01:10:26,289 --> 01:10:28,323
- Who wants to be
Money Penny?

1418
01:10:28,325 --> 01:10:29,557
All right, shall we?

1419
01:10:54,584 --> 01:10:59,687
- Cheers.

1420
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:07,462
- You know Pam, we woulda
perfectly understood

1421
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:08,763
if you needed to cancel.

1422
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:11,933
- Why would I have to cancel?

1423
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:13,701
- Well if I got
fired, the only party

1424
01:11:13,703 --> 01:11:17,405
we'd be havin' that night
is my funeral.

1425
01:11:22,679 --> 01:11:24,713
- You know what?

1426
01:11:24,714 --> 01:11:26,748
I think he did say
something about that.

1427
01:11:32,956 --> 01:11:35,423
- You weren't supposed
to say anything, Ted.

1428
01:11:35,425 --> 01:11:37,558
- Here are my Parmesan
portobello slices

1429
01:11:37,560 --> 01:11:38,760
with sun-dried tomato.

1430
01:11:40,063 --> 01:11:41,462
- Pam, these are so good.

1431
01:11:41,464 --> 01:11:43,698
Do you have a secret ingredient?

1432
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:45,400
- Oh I'm sorry, Bob.

1433
01:11:45,402 --> 01:11:48,303
My secret is what you
see is what you get.

1434
01:11:48,305 --> 01:11:52,607
No little white lies,
no half-truths, no
funny little fibs.

1435
01:11:52,609 --> 01:11:53,908
- Bob, will you
excuse us a second?

1436
01:11:53,910 --> 01:11:55,221
- Why?

1437
01:11:55,222 --> 01:11:56,533
No, they're fine.

1438
01:11:56,534 --> 01:11:57,845
They already know that
you lost your job.

1439
01:11:57,847 --> 01:11:59,981
I just found out from Fred.

1440
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:01,700
- Oh, I'm Ted.

1441
01:12:01,701 --> 01:12:03,418
- Pam, you have
to let me explain.

1442
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:07,455
- Trust me, this way
it'll be so much easier

1443
01:12:07,457 --> 01:12:08,723
to split up the assets.

1444
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:17,865
- Corey, now that we're not
competin' over the trip,

1445
01:12:17,867 --> 01:12:20,768
you wanna tell me how you
sold so many damn boxes?

1446
01:12:27,844 --> 01:12:29,610
- What
the fuck is this?

1447
01:12:29,612 --> 01:12:32,013
- Brianna, are you okay?

1448
01:12:32,015 --> 01:12:33,715
- Am I okay?

1449
01:12:33,717 --> 01:12:35,800
Am I okay?

1450
01:12:35,801 --> 01:12:37,884
I just spent an hour in
the car convincing myself

1451
01:12:37,887 --> 01:12:40,855
you didn't leap to your death
and here you are having a--

1452
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,090
- A dinner party.

1453
01:12:43,026 --> 01:12:44,625
- A dinner party.
- Yeah.

1454
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:46,394
- Well why wasn't I invited?

1455
01:12:46,396 --> 01:12:49,530
- It's sort of a couples-only.

1456
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:50,943
- Oh, couples-only.

1457
01:12:50,944 --> 01:12:52,355
Why are you still
wearing that costume?

1458
01:12:52,356 --> 01:12:53,767
- 'Cause it's a spy
theme dinner party.

1459
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:55,703
- Oh, a spy theme dinner party.

1460
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,638
Ooh, so fancy.

1461
01:12:57,640 --> 01:12:58,706
You know what, Pam?

1462
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:01,693
I just can't believe
after hours of me

1463
01:13:01,694 --> 01:13:04,679
listening to your marital
woes, this is how I'm treated.

1464
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:08,783
But if the name's not
taken, I'm Pussy Galore.

1465
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:16,658
- The hell are you doin' here?

1466
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:18,626
- We have to get you--
- Hi, I'm Pam.

1467
01:13:18,628 --> 01:13:20,528
I didn't get to
introduce myself earlier

1468
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,797
because you're whoring yourself
around with my husband.

1469
01:13:22,799 --> 01:13:25,099
But I just want to let
you know that tomorrow

1470
01:13:25,101 --> 01:13:27,252
we are getting a divorce.

1471
01:13:27,253 --> 01:13:29,404
But tonight I'm having
my dinner party, okay?

1472
01:13:29,406 --> 01:13:30,605
- I came by to say
that I'm sorry.

1473
01:13:30,607 --> 01:13:32,084
- Sorry you got caught or sorry

1474
01:13:32,085 --> 01:13:33,562
that you're a whore
that lacks style?

1475
01:13:33,563 --> 01:13:35,040
- Sorry because this
isn't what it looked like.

1476
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:36,160
- Exactly.

1477
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:37,277
- Don't insult my intelligence.

1478
01:13:37,278 --> 01:13:38,394
- No, I'm serious.

1479
01:13:38,395 --> 01:13:39,511
Alexandria here is an actress.

1480
01:13:39,516 --> 01:13:40,548
- A method actress actually.

1481
01:13:40,550 --> 01:13:42,183
- Superbly talented.

1482
01:13:42,185 --> 01:13:43,951
- Okay I saw, remember.

1483
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:46,454
- Right.

1484
01:13:47,624 --> 01:13:49,340
You see, sweetheart.

1485
01:13:49,341 --> 01:13:51,057
I found out that a huge
potential client and his wife

1486
01:13:51,060 --> 01:13:52,794
were gonna be honeymooning
over at that hotel.

1487
01:13:52,796 --> 01:13:56,197
So I thought why not hire
an actress to play my wife,

1488
01:13:56,199 --> 01:13:58,566
go to the hotel, bond with
guy and make the big sale.

1489
01:13:58,568 --> 01:14:00,034
- Yeah I mean, it was
completely legitimate.

1490
01:14:00,036 --> 01:14:02,003
I've been in the business
since I was a kid.

1491
01:14:02,005 --> 01:14:03,571
Lots of musical theater.

1492
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:05,290
- Yeah, whatever.

1493
01:14:05,291 --> 01:14:07,008
Look, why don't you help
yourself to a doggie bag

1494
01:14:07,010 --> 01:14:08,793
and then you can choke on it?

1495
01:14:08,794 --> 01:14:10,577
- Oh, I'm staying here
'cause Corey hired me

1496
01:14:10,580 --> 01:14:11,612
to be here for the dinner party.

1497
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:13,548
- That's right, I did.

1498
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:14,749
- To do what?

1499
01:14:17,620 --> 01:14:18,853
- To teach dance.

1500
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:20,855
Cue the music.

1501
01:14:28,097 --> 01:14:29,530
Dance with me.

1502
01:14:40,009 --> 01:14:41,642
- You lucky son of a bitch.

1503
01:14:46,983 --> 01:14:47,949
- Spin me.

1504
01:14:49,252 --> 01:14:50,485
Egan's on his way.

1505
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:56,191
- You could not have
hired her tonight.

1506
01:14:56,192 --> 01:14:58,493
You didn't even remember that
we were having a dinner party.

1507
01:14:59,596 --> 01:15:02,063
- You have to get these
people out of here.

1508
01:15:02,065 --> 01:15:04,031
Go ahead and ask
your wife to dance.

1509
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:08,636
You have to get these
people out of here.

1510
01:15:08,638 --> 01:15:10,438
- Fine.

1511
01:15:10,439 --> 01:15:12,239
If people are dancing,
we're dancing.

1512
01:15:46,009 --> 01:15:49,710
¶ You can try to stop me ¶

1513
01:15:49,712 --> 01:15:50,845
¶ You can ¶

1514
01:15:50,847 --> 01:15:52,680
¶ You can try to stop me ¶

1515
01:15:52,682 --> 01:15:57,818
¶ And I'm goin' 'til
the wheels fall off ¶

1516
01:15:58,588 --> 01:15:59,820
- I need you to come clean.

1517
01:15:59,822 --> 01:16:01,088
Just be honest with me.

1518
01:16:03,560 --> 01:16:04,825
I mean if I have ever
meant anything to you

1519
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:06,928
in any level at any point,

1520
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:10,598
I deserve to know
what's going on.

1521
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:21,943
- You're right.

1522
01:16:38,928 --> 01:16:39,927
- Nobody moves.

1523
01:16:41,898 --> 01:16:43,598
Where is it?

1524
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:44,365
- Don't know.

1525
01:16:45,134 --> 01:16:46,667
- I want my pen back.

1526
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:48,201
- All right all
right, take it easy.

1527
01:16:48,204 --> 01:16:50,705
But leave them outta
this, they're innocent.

1528
01:16:52,875 --> 01:16:54,242
- No no, yeah you're right.

1529
01:16:54,243 --> 01:16:55,610
We should just keep
this between us,

1530
01:16:55,611 --> 01:16:56,978
but I like a little
bit of insurance.

1531
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:58,947
- No.

1532
01:16:58,948 --> 01:17:00,915
- I want my pen back
with the plans on it

1533
01:17:00,916 --> 01:17:02,883
delivered in an hour and why
don't you gas up the jet?

1534
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:03,985
- A jet?
- Mm-hmm.

1535
01:17:03,987 --> 01:17:05,653
- And if I can't
get it here by then?

1536
01:17:05,654 --> 01:17:07,320
- Then your wife will die.

1537
01:17:07,323 --> 01:17:08,723
- She's not his wife.

1538
01:17:08,725 --> 01:17:10,036
This is his wife.

1539
01:17:10,037 --> 01:17:11,348
- Yeah, could someone
just please explain to me

1540
01:17:11,349 --> 01:17:12,660
what the hell is going on?

1541
01:17:13,730 --> 01:17:15,062
- Honey, I'm a spy.

1542
01:17:15,064 --> 01:17:16,197
- Okay, enough of
that charade already.

1543
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:17,164
- No, I am.

1544
01:17:17,166 --> 01:17:19,116
I'm serious.

1545
01:17:19,117 --> 01:17:21,067
We work for the government
as part of an elite taskforce

1546
01:17:21,070 --> 01:17:23,137
trained to stop high-tech
futuristic weapons

1547
01:17:23,139 --> 01:17:26,240
from falling in the hands
of fuckfaces like this guy.

1548
01:17:26,242 --> 01:17:28,075
- Okay, well this
definitely falls

1549
01:17:28,077 --> 01:17:30,044
under reconcilable differences.

1550
01:17:34,283 --> 01:17:36,117
- Hello?

1551
01:17:36,118 --> 01:17:37,952
- Smuts, I need you to
bring me the pen right away.

1552
01:17:44,694 --> 01:17:46,027
- Okay.

1553
01:17:46,028 --> 01:17:47,361
- You guys weren't
actually married?

1554
01:17:47,363 --> 01:17:49,063
- No.

1555
01:17:49,065 --> 01:17:51,065
- But your ring seemed so real.

1556
01:17:51,067 --> 01:17:52,667
- It was cubic zirconia.

1557
01:17:52,669 --> 01:17:53,834
- Shut up.
- Mm-hmm.

1558
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,003
- Shut up.
- Yeah.

1559
01:17:56,005 --> 01:17:57,705
- So is mine.

1560
01:17:57,706 --> 01:17:59,406
- Wait, but you guys
seem so happy together.

1561
01:17:59,407 --> 01:18:01,107
- No, you guys seemed
so happy together.

1562
01:18:01,110 --> 01:18:02,476
- Thank you.
- Okay.

1563
01:18:02,477 --> 01:18:03,843
Nobody's actually
happy here, okay?

1564
01:18:03,844 --> 01:18:05,210
Let's review: you
and I aren't married.

1565
01:18:05,214 --> 01:18:06,981
These two aren't married.

1566
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:08,749
The only people here that
are really married are them.

1567
01:18:08,751 --> 01:18:09,951
- Oh, no.

1568
01:18:09,952 --> 01:18:11,152
No, actually we're
getting a divorce.

1569
01:18:12,355 --> 01:18:14,255
Oh fuck, my lasagna.

1570
01:18:14,257 --> 01:18:15,923
- Whoa, excuse me?

1571
01:18:15,925 --> 01:18:17,058
- My lasagna, it's burning.

1572
01:18:17,060 --> 01:18:18,359
I need to get it.

1573
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:21,145
- Are you kidding me?

1574
01:18:21,146 --> 01:18:22,862
Do you want this
house to burn down?

1575
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,243
- I don't care.

1576
01:18:24,244 --> 01:18:25,622
- To him sweetheart,
I don't think

1577
01:18:25,623 --> 01:18:27,001
your lasagna's the
key issue here.

1578
01:18:28,204 --> 01:18:31,372
- It's actually not my
lasagna, it's Stouffer's.

1579
01:18:31,374 --> 01:18:33,974
- You want me to serve
Stouffer's at our dinner party?

1580
01:18:33,976 --> 01:18:35,910
- Well I was gonna
make it from scratch,

1581
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:39,113
but you in the midst were
playing spy meets adulterer

1582
01:18:39,115 --> 01:18:41,849
meets probably the worst
husband in the world.

1583
01:18:41,851 --> 01:18:43,284
- Honey, I think
you're overreacting

1584
01:18:43,286 --> 01:18:44,785
just a little bit
here, all right?

1585
01:18:44,787 --> 01:18:46,387
I'm gonna take care of this.

1586
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:47,988
- Overreacting?

1587
01:18:47,990 --> 01:18:49,623
Overreacting.

1588
01:18:49,624 --> 01:18:51,257
Do you know how
humiliating this is?

1589
01:18:52,729 --> 01:18:54,128
You know how heartbreaking it is

1590
01:18:54,130 --> 01:18:55,863
to have your marriage
be over within...

1591
01:18:55,865 --> 01:18:57,064
Okay.

1592
01:18:57,066 --> 01:18:58,365
Oh, in a year?

1593
01:19:00,136 --> 01:19:01,529
Seriously?

1594
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:02,923
I'm now a statistic.

1595
01:19:02,924 --> 01:19:04,317
I'm one of those,

1596
01:19:04,318 --> 01:19:05,711
one of those people
where you probably

1597
01:19:05,712 --> 01:19:07,105
had some I don't know Navy
SEAL mental training shit

1598
01:19:07,110 --> 01:19:10,277
where you know how to handle
all these sorts of situations

1599
01:19:10,279 --> 01:19:12,046
to probably diffuse a
bomb under pressure.

1600
01:19:12,048 --> 01:19:13,147
- The hell is she doin'?

1601
01:19:16,119 --> 01:19:17,752
- I'm leaving.

1602
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:19,854
I'm packing my things.

1603
01:19:19,855 --> 01:19:21,955
You can shoot me if you want,
but otherwise I'm moving out.

1604
01:19:23,159 --> 01:19:24,759
- Can you stop her?

1605
01:19:24,761 --> 01:19:25,977
- Can you stop her?

1606
01:19:25,978 --> 01:19:27,194
- Yeah, I could shoot her.

1607
01:19:35,972 --> 01:19:36,971
- Let's go.

1608
01:19:40,343 --> 01:19:42,143
- I knew we should've
gone to Nepal.

1609
01:19:42,145 --> 01:19:43,310
If not Nepal, Paris.

1610
01:19:43,312 --> 01:19:45,112
If not Pairs, London.

1611
01:19:45,114 --> 01:19:47,481
I mean just done something,

1612
01:19:47,482 --> 01:19:49,849
anything to escape the confines
of this ridiculous place.

1613
01:19:49,852 --> 01:19:51,819
- Pam, sweetheart.

1614
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:53,787
Let's just get through this
and we can reset, okay?

1615
01:19:53,790 --> 01:19:55,423
We'll call it a
second honeymoon.

1616
01:19:55,424 --> 01:19:57,057
We can go to all those
places, I promise.

1617
01:19:57,059 --> 01:19:58,692
- Okay, so now you don't mind

1618
01:19:58,693 --> 01:20:00,326
about skipping our
weekend projects?

1619
01:20:00,329 --> 01:20:02,196
You know putting off
the track lighting,

1620
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:05,800
not even fixing the ceiling
that constantly crumbles.

1621
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:14,125
- How many times do I
have to tell you, Pam

1622
01:20:14,126 --> 01:20:16,177
that I will get to it
when I fucking get to it.

1623
01:20:18,347 --> 01:20:20,848
Press the red button
under the bed.

1624
01:20:23,019 --> 01:20:24,151
- Holy shit.

1625
01:20:28,224 --> 01:20:30,090
Okay, what is that?

1626
01:20:30,092 --> 01:20:32,393
- That's a high-tech electrical
charge particle solidifier.

1627
01:20:32,395 --> 01:20:34,829
In short, force field.

1628
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:37,932
- So you just had this
stuff here the whole time?

1629
01:20:39,101 --> 01:20:40,000
- Yeah, pretty much.

1630
01:20:40,002 --> 01:20:40,968
Sorry.

1631
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:43,404
- You never thought about
pulling out one of these gizmos

1632
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:45,839
when we were getting intimate?

1633
01:20:47,076 --> 01:20:48,943
- You would've wanted that?

1634
01:20:48,945 --> 01:20:50,978
- Yeah, I would've tried that.

1635
01:20:50,980 --> 01:20:53,981
- Well, we can.

1636
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:56,983
- Corey, I'm not having
anymore dinner parties.

1637
01:21:35,625 --> 01:21:37,458
Anyone for charades?

1638
01:21:38,661 --> 01:21:40,127
- Who wants a nightcap?

1639
01:21:45,167 --> 01:21:46,567
- 60
off 10th Avenue.

1640
01:21:46,569 --> 01:21:48,753
- Come on.

1641
01:21:54,343 --> 01:21:56,310
- I just have one question.

1642
01:21:56,312 --> 01:21:57,912
- Yeah?

1643
01:21:57,914 --> 01:21:59,280
- Is your real name Corey?

1644
01:22:02,051 --> 01:22:03,150
- I wish it was.

1645
01:22:06,055 --> 01:22:07,054
- Goodbye.

1646
01:22:24,240 --> 01:22:27,574
- Where are ya headed?
- Does it matter?

1647
01:22:42,725 --> 01:22:44,325
- Whoa, hey.

1648
01:22:44,327 --> 01:22:46,226
Were you serious?

1649
01:22:46,228 --> 01:22:48,095
- Brianna, wasn't it your idea

1650
01:22:48,097 --> 01:22:49,997
for me to get out of
here and see the world?

1651
01:22:49,999 --> 01:22:51,498
- I mean it was and
then we tried it

1652
01:22:51,500 --> 01:22:53,634
and it was really
exhausting, you know?

1653
01:22:53,636 --> 01:22:54,924
It's like kinky sex.

1654
01:22:54,925 --> 01:22:56,213
You think you want it
'til you actually have it

1655
01:22:56,214 --> 01:22:57,502
and end up with a
penis in your ear.

1656
01:22:57,506 --> 01:22:59,139
- That's disgusting.

1657
01:23:00,042 --> 01:23:01,642
- Do you even have a plan?

1658
01:23:01,644 --> 01:23:02,693
- Yeah.

1659
01:23:02,694 --> 01:23:03,743
- What's your plan?

1660
01:23:03,746 --> 01:23:05,612
- To climb Mount Everest.

1661
01:23:05,614 --> 01:23:08,182
- To climb Mount
Everest, really?

1662
01:23:08,184 --> 01:23:11,352
What, are you working for
"National Geographic" now?

1663
01:23:32,575 --> 01:23:36,310
- Undercover: Discover
who you really are.

1664
01:23:48,407 --> 01:23:49,423
- What about Cairo?

1665
01:23:50,326 --> 01:23:51,291
- Yeah?

1666
01:23:53,295 --> 01:23:56,030
- Cozumel?
- Cozumel's cool.

1667
01:23:57,166 --> 01:24:01,535
- Dude, what's wrong?

1668
01:24:02,438 --> 01:24:03,670
- Nothin's wrong, man.

1669
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,439
- Okay.

1670
01:24:06,675 --> 01:24:08,675
- Oh, what about Rio?

1671
01:24:08,677 --> 01:24:10,044
- I like Rio, you know that.

1672
01:24:10,046 --> 01:24:11,111
- I love Rio.

1673
01:24:12,448 --> 01:24:13,647
What?

1674
01:24:13,649 --> 01:24:15,282
You're not excited about Rio.

1675
01:24:15,284 --> 01:24:16,583
Okay, you must've forgotten

1676
01:24:16,585 --> 01:24:18,869
about that night
in the rainforest.

1677
01:24:18,870 --> 01:24:21,154
- I didn't forget about the
night in the rainforest, Smuts.

1678
01:24:22,158 --> 01:24:23,190
Why can't we keep
it simple, you know?

1679
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:24,058
Like in the movie.

1680
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,059
- What?

1681
01:24:26,095 --> 01:24:27,311
Okay, okay.

1682
01:24:27,312 --> 01:24:28,528
Three feet, three
feet, three feet.

1683
01:24:30,466 --> 01:24:32,332
Okay, that's it.

1684
01:24:32,334 --> 01:24:33,600
The sun's sizzling your brain.

1685
01:24:33,602 --> 01:24:34,835
We've climbed too close.

1686
01:24:34,837 --> 01:24:36,737
C'mon, we need some UV.

1687
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:39,373
Here, use this.

1688
01:24:39,375 --> 01:24:40,507
It really works.

1689
01:24:40,509 --> 01:24:41,442
- Yeah, I know.

1690
01:24:41,444 --> 01:24:43,261
I got the whole line.

1691
01:24:43,262 --> 01:24:45,079
Even their eye moisturizer's
incredible, isn't it?

1692
01:24:45,081 --> 01:24:46,480
Soothing, too.

1693
01:24:46,482 --> 01:24:48,315
- You really miss her, don't ya?

1694
01:24:50,086 --> 01:24:51,085
- I do not.

1695
01:24:51,087 --> 01:24:54,421
- From my perspective, you
never stopped loving her.

1696
01:24:54,423 --> 01:24:56,223
No matter what your cover was,

1697
01:24:56,225 --> 01:24:58,225
you can't disguise
what's in your heart.

1698
01:25:00,196 --> 01:25:01,161
- Yeah.

1699
01:25:02,631 --> 01:25:04,581
Yeah, maybe.

1700
01:25:04,582 --> 01:25:06,532
- You know, I really
didn't hear what you said.

1701
01:25:06,535 --> 01:25:09,636
But that sounded really
fucking beautiful, Suckerfish.

1702
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:10,637
- Thanks, man.

1703
01:25:10,639 --> 01:25:15,709
- Hey, you wanna get a
beer with me later on?

1704
01:25:15,711 --> 01:25:16,710
- I'd like that.

1705
01:25:16,712 --> 01:25:18,378
- Just kidding.

1706
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:20,247
I'm not for the sweet
stuff, let's move.

1707
01:25:25,187 --> 01:25:27,454
Hold up, we got a problem.

1708
01:25:42,271 --> 01:25:43,537
- Excuse me, sir.

1709
01:25:44,406 --> 01:25:45,806
Jimbo?

1710
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,241
- Very good Jimbo.

1711
01:25:50,246 --> 01:25:51,645
Debit or credit?

1712
01:26:20,509 --> 01:26:23,477
- "Pam, I hope you
enjoy the basket.

1713
01:26:23,479 --> 01:26:26,163
"I think it would've
been perfect

1714
01:26:26,164 --> 01:26:28,848
"for the second dinner
party we never got to have."

1715
01:26:30,819 --> 01:26:32,186
Dinner party.

1716
01:26:33,422 --> 01:26:34,955
What dinner party?

1717
01:27:17,466 --> 01:27:19,466
- What the hell is this?

1718
01:27:19,468 --> 01:27:23,003
- Corey, this is
an intervention.

1719
01:27:23,005 --> 01:27:24,338
- Oh god, not again.

1720
01:27:24,340 --> 01:27:25,422
For what?

1721
01:27:25,423 --> 01:27:26,505
- Because you're miserable.

1722
01:27:26,508 --> 01:27:27,908
- I'm not miserable.

1723
01:27:29,511 --> 01:27:31,378
- Oh, no no no no.

1724
01:27:31,380 --> 01:27:32,696
What?

1725
01:27:32,697 --> 01:27:34,013
- Yeah, we started dating
after the dinner party.

1726
01:27:34,014 --> 01:27:35,330
- You've been dating
Brianna this whole time

1727
01:27:35,331 --> 01:27:36,647
and you didn't tell me?

1728
01:27:36,652 --> 01:27:39,019
- Look, what was
I supposed to say?

1729
01:27:39,020 --> 01:27:41,387
I mean I'm in covert ops with
your ex-wife's best friend?

1730
01:27:41,390 --> 01:27:43,490
- I love it when
he talks like that.

1731
01:27:43,492 --> 01:27:44,491
- You guys?

1732
01:27:46,662 --> 01:27:48,295
I figured you hated me.

1733
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:51,498
I was a total pain in the ass
and completely self-centered.

1734
01:27:51,500 --> 01:27:53,700
- I don't care what you were.

1735
01:27:53,702 --> 01:27:55,486
After I canned your ass,

1736
01:27:55,487 --> 01:27:57,271
these guys wouldn't shut
up about your spy tactics.

1737
01:27:57,273 --> 01:27:58,705
When I finally let them try it,

1738
01:27:58,707 --> 01:28:00,707
they broke all
your sales records.

1739
01:28:00,709 --> 01:28:03,043
- Yup, made him go method.

1740
01:28:03,045 --> 01:28:04,795
- We also got a bowling coach

1741
01:28:04,796 --> 01:28:06,546
and kicked the shit
outta Diana's Floral.

1742
01:28:06,548 --> 01:28:08,515
- Bob's been wearin'
his wrist guard.

1743
01:28:08,517 --> 01:28:10,951
- All right, well

1744
01:28:10,953 --> 01:28:12,619
this is all well and good, guys.

1745
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:14,554
But somebody please tell me

1746
01:28:14,556 --> 01:28:17,958
why the hell you went through
all this trouble and what for?

1747
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,826
- Because I had to
test the new tranq gun.

1748
01:28:26,402 --> 01:28:27,918
- Hey.

1749
01:28:27,919 --> 01:28:29,435
- It's actually my tranq gun.
- Dude.

1750
01:28:29,438 --> 01:28:32,056
- So you're the reason
for this intervention?

1751
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,675
- Well if you're not too busy
tryin' to save the world,

1752
01:28:34,677 --> 01:28:36,943
I thought we should
give us another shot,

1753
01:28:37,746 --> 01:28:38,879
a different shot.

1754
01:28:38,881 --> 01:28:41,282
You know if you
hadn't been a spy,

1755
01:28:41,283 --> 01:28:43,684
I would've never woken up
and realized who I really am.

1756
01:28:44,853 --> 01:28:47,654
- What about just being
still looking in the mirror?

1757
01:28:48,590 --> 01:28:50,891
- Where's the adventure
in that, my dear?

1758
01:28:50,893 --> 01:28:53,427
- So does this mean we get
to take a second honeymoon?

1759
01:28:53,429 --> 01:28:54,561
- Anywhere you want.

1760
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:57,548
- What do you think
about Kathmandu?

1761
01:28:57,549 --> 01:29:00,534
- Oh you know what they say,
"What happens in Kathmandu,

1762
01:29:00,536 --> 01:29:02,536
"stays in Kathmandu."
- "Stays in Kathmandu."

1763
01:29:07,009 --> 01:29:09,676
- Okay, so maybe
the whole intervention thing

1764
01:29:09,678 --> 01:29:12,412
was a little extreme.

1765
01:29:14,516 --> 01:29:17,417
But if we embrace our
primal caveman instincts

1766
01:29:17,419 --> 01:29:19,553
instead of hiding
from them in suburbia,

1767
01:29:21,090 --> 01:29:25,625
we'll realize that every
day can be an adventure.

1768
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:48,482
¶ But I'm goin' 'til
the wheels fall off ¶

1769
01:29:58,527 --> 01:30:04,765

1770
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:07,401

1778
01:30:29,024 --> 01:30:31,925
¶ Don't call me your baby ¶

1779
01:30:31,927 --> 01:30:33,427
¶ Mistake me for a lady ¶

1780
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:35,012
¶ Don't you ¶

1781
01:30:35,013 --> 01:30:36,596
¶ Don't you know
that I'm crazy ¶

1782
01:30:36,598 --> 01:30:38,999
¶ Don't you know that I'm ¶

1783
01:30:39,001 --> 01:30:41,034
¶ Don't say that you want me ¶

1784
01:30:41,036 --> 01:30:42,169
¶ Don't say that you ¶

1785
01:30:42,171 --> 01:30:43,703
¶ You need me ¶

1786
01:30:43,705 --> 01:30:46,039
¶ Don't you dare believe me ¶

1787
01:30:46,041 --> 01:30:51,144
¶ Don't you know that I'm ¶

01:30:54,683 --> 01:30:59,152
¶ But I'm goin' 'til
the wheels fall off ¶
