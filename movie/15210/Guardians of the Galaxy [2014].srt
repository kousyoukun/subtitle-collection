477

And to do that,
I'm gonna need a few things.

478
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:06,783
The guards wear security bands

479
00:34:06,945 --> 00:34:09,323

- Look at him, he's useless.
- right.

485
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,896
And finally, on the wall back there

486
00:34:21,897 --> 00:34:24,001
is a black panel. Blinky yellow light.

487
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,164
- Do you see it?
- Yeah.

488
00:34:26,231 --> 00:34:30,373
There's a quarnyx battery behind it.
Purplish box, green wires.

489
00:34:30,469 --> 00:34:32,642
To get into that watchtower,
I definitely need it.

490
00:34:32,704 --> 00:34:34,149
How are we supposed to do that?

491
00:34:34,206 --> 00:34:36,516

these bald-bodies find you attractive.

they find you attractive.

495

the air, and it's in the

496
00:34:43,487 --> 00:34:45,560
middle of the most
heavily-guarded part of the prison.

497
00:34:45,651 --> 00:34:48,393
It's impossible to get up there
without being seen.

498
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:49,522
I got one plan,

499
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,727

a frickin' quarnyx battery,

Can I get back to it? Thanks.

502
00:34:56,328 --> 00:34:59,900
Now, this is important.
Once the battery is removed,

503
00:34:59,998 --> 00:35:02,410
everything is gonna slam
into emergency mode.

But what if I want it more
than the person who has it'?

No, I want it more, sir.

That's actually murder.
