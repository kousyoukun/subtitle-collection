1
00:03:44,183 --> 00:03:47,209
Wait, son!

2
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,845
Let me go, Father! This fight is
forthe biggest chance ofmy life!

3
00:03:49,956 --> 00:03:52,891
Crazy fool!
You'll get killed!

4
00:03:52,992 --> 00:03:57,793
Who wants to be a gambler? Farmers
should shut up and work the fields!

5
00:03:57,897 --> 00:04:01,060
Who wants a long life eating porridge?

6
00:04:02,268 --> 00:04:05,829
I want to eat good food, wear nice
things  A short, exciting life for me!

7
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:18,110
I'd like a drink ofwater

8
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:23,781
Why didn'tyou stop him?

9
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,450
He wouldn't listen

10
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,398
Kids these days have all gone mad

11
00:04:36,402 --> 00:04:41,465
It's not onlythe young ones 
Everybody's after easy money

12
00:04:42,575 --> 00:04:46,875
Gambling, throwing dice

13
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:49,709
Can't tell whose money is whose

14
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:56,721
I hear the brewer's
become a silk broker

15
00:04:58,024 --> 00:05:01,255
Says he'll pay more
than the silk store

16
00:05:01,361 --> 00:05:06,663
But what's the difference

17
00:05:07,834 --> 00:05:11,099
when the town is the way it is?

18
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:17,074
Who knows when
the silk fair will open

19
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:24,982
The smell ofblood
brings the hungry dogs

20
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,821
They fight to collect the silk
and soak it in their blood

21
00:05:30,923 --> 00:05:33,448
Then they can hold the fair!

22
00:07:45,424 --> 00:07:49,758
Samurai, wantto be a bodyguard?

23
00:07:49,862 --> 00:07:52,490
I can fix it up foryou 
Lots of opportunities

24
00:07:52,598 --> 00:07:55,260
I charge one ryo

25
00:07:55,368 --> 00:07:56,767
Which side do you want to go?

26
00:07:57,870 --> 00:08:00,031
Seibei runs a brothel 
Plenty ofwomen

27
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:03,734
But he's not doing well

28
00:08:03,843 --> 00:08:06,971
I'd bet on Ushitora

29
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:11,982
Look  The inn at the corner 
That's his place

30
00:08:13,119 --> 00:08:16,782
Say Hansuke sent you

31
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:21,451
Wish I could take you,
but I'm an officer

32
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:27,494
Don't forget  I get one ryo

33
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:26,219
What's up?

34
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:29,920
The road is public 
Even dogs can pass

35
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:54,245
You have to put on
a better show than that

36
00:09:55,955 --> 00:09:58,822
They only look tough

37
00:09:58,924 --> 00:10:02,382
Chop an arm off, and they'll shut up 
Then is your chance

38
00:10:05,498 --> 00:10:07,398
Give it up, scum!

39
00:10:09,635 --> 00:10:11,034
Come in

40
00:10:24,116 --> 00:10:25,515
Sake?

41
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,977
Food

42
00:10:28,087 --> 00:10:30,112
No business these days,
so there's not much

43
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:32,087
Even the rice is cold

44
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:34,750
I don't mind

45
00:10:43,002 --> 00:10:45,095
Old man

46
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:48,139
I know  No money

47
00:10:50,543 --> 00:10:52,443
I'll cause some trouble and pay you

48
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:56,610
No! I've had enough offighting!

49
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,311
I won't charge you,
but get the hell out oftown

50
00:11:03,355 --> 00:11:04,754
Thanks

51
00:11:09,395 --> 00:11:11,295
There he goes again!

52
00:11:13,299 --> 00:11:14,891
The undertaker

53
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,197
Business is booming

54
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:20,704
Can't make coffins fast enough

55
00:11:22,174 --> 00:11:25,302
It's better not to have any gamblers

56
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:28,938
One boss to a town we can tolerate

57
00:11:29,048 --> 00:11:33,485
But not two 
That's only good for the cooper

58
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:35,876
Quiet!

59
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:45,622
Gamblers are a bloodless, greedy bunch

60
00:11:45,731 --> 00:11:48,256
They shouldn't tryto act human

61
00:11:49,368 --> 00:11:52,963
But Seibei,

62
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:57,873
he wanted his son
to have all his territory

63
00:11:57,977 --> 00:12:03,779
No wonder Ushitora, his right-hand man,
wouldn't agree to it

64
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:05,441
A strange name

65
00:12:05,551 --> 00:12:10,784
His ma started her labor
in the year ofthe Ushi (cow)),

66
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:14,986
but he bounced out in the newyear
ofTora (tiger), the pest

67
00:12:15,094 --> 00:12:18,996
He broke with Seibei
and became a boss

68
00:12:19,098 --> 00:12:23,000
Now only swords can settle things

69
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:29,540
Both sides are out rounding up men

70
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,738
Instead ofsilk fair,
it's a corpse fair

71
00:12:47,126 --> 00:12:49,617
How's business, cooper?

72
00:12:49,728 --> 00:12:52,993
How many coffins did you sell
last night?

73
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:54,998
Two to your side

74
00:12:56,502 --> 00:12:58,493
Four to the other side

75
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:07,538
Not so bad

76
00:13:20,292 --> 00:13:22,590
Inokichi, Ushitora's brother

77
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:24,322
Like his name, he's a wild pig

78
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:27,490
He's an idiot,
but when he gets mad, he's impossible

79
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,501
He's come back with three more killers

80
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:52,151
A disgrace!
That's our officer

81
00:13:52,258 --> 00:13:55,557
He's supposed to arrest crooks

82
00:13:55,661 --> 00:13:58,061
But he's not the only one

83
00:14:01,066 --> 00:14:02,727
Look

84
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:06,737
Tazaemon from this silk store
started the mess

85
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:11,742
He was the town mayor
but he screwed up

86
00:14:11,844 --> 00:14:17,840
He is surviving on Seibei's money

87
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:24,822
Then Tokuemon, the sake brewer,
sided with Ushitora

88
00:14:24,924 --> 00:14:29,418
He already acts as ifhe's the next
head man  He's even getting into silk

89
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:32,520
NowTazaemon is a helpless fool

90
00:14:32,631 --> 00:14:36,795
He bangs his prayer drum all day,
hoping for Seibei to win

91
00:14:38,604 --> 00:14:40,504
See?  He's started!

92
00:14:54,453 --> 00:14:56,648
The lot ofthem!

93
00:14:56,755 --> 00:14:59,087
Anyway, this town is finished

94
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:02,092
Now do you see?

95
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:06,664
Ifyou stay, you'll get sucked in too

96
00:15:08,334 --> 00:15:10,734
Eat quickly, and then leave

97
00:15:11,837 --> 00:15:14,601
No more rice  Some sake

98
00:15:17,076 --> 00:15:20,443
I like it here 
I'll stay

99
00:15:20,546 --> 00:15:23,743
What? 
You still don't understand?

100
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:26,447
Yes, I do

101
00:15:26,552 --> 00:15:28,452
That's why I'm staying

102
00:15:29,555 --> 00:15:31,819
Listen to me

103
00:15:31,924 --> 00:15:35,189
In this town,
I'll get paid for killing

104
00:15:35,294 --> 00:15:39,025
And this town is full ofmen
who are better off dead

105
00:15:39,131 --> 00:15:40,530
Think about it

106
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:44,859
Seibei, Ushitora, gamblers

107
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:48,565
This place would be better
without them

108
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:51,768
You couldn't do it
ifyou had nine lives!

109
00:15:53,912 --> 00:15:56,437
Not alone

110
00:15:56,548 --> 00:15:58,482
Howthen?

111
00:15:58,584 --> 00:16:01,917
Sake 
I'll thinkwhile I drink

112
00:16:10,095 --> 00:16:12,427
Everybody in this town is crazy!

113
00:16:12,531 --> 00:16:15,091
Butyou're even crazier!

114
00:16:37,356 --> 00:16:39,256
I want to talk to Seibei

115
00:16:40,659 --> 00:16:42,058
Who are you?

116
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:57,474
Do you want to buy me?

117
00:17:01,447 --> 00:17:03,347
As a bodyguard

118
00:17:05,451 --> 00:17:06,850
I'll show you what I'm worth

119
00:17:59,671 --> 00:18:02,071
You again?

120
00:18:21,493 --> 00:18:24,257
You guys have such cute faces

121
00:18:24,363 --> 00:18:25,421
What?

122
00:18:27,466 --> 00:18:31,903
You can't even hurt a fly,
yet you act so tough  very cute

123
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:37,070
Don't take us for fools 
See this tattoo?

124
00:18:37,176 --> 00:18:39,576
I wasn't in prison for nothing!

125
00:18:42,714 --> 00:18:45,012
The law's after me

126
00:18:45,117 --> 00:18:48,018
I'll hang if I'm ever caught!

127
00:18:49,221 --> 00:18:51,689
Me too

128
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:53,690
They'll cut my head offsomeday

129
00:18:53,792 --> 00:18:56,886
I've broken every law

130
00:18:57,996 --> 00:18:59,691
So you won't mind ifl kill all ofyou?

131
00:18:59,798 --> 00:19:02,699
What? 
Kill me ifyou can!

132
00:19:04,403 --> 00:19:05,802
It'll hurt

133
00:19:05,904 --> 00:19:08,134
You can't be a gambler
ifyou're scared ofthe sword

134
00:19:11,443 --> 00:19:14,105
No cure for fools

135
00:19:32,431 --> 00:19:35,457
Cooper  Two coffins

136
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:38,092
No, maybe three

137
00:19:51,984 --> 00:19:54,953
Name me a price

138
00:19:55,053 --> 00:19:56,953
How much until the battle is over?

139
00:19:57,055 --> 00:20:02,220
Well, how about three pieces of gold?

140
00:20:03,862 --> 00:20:06,558
I'm going to Ushitora 
He might pay more

141
00:20:09,134 --> 00:20:10,658
Four ryo then!

142
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:12,669
Five!

143
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:14,363
Six ryo!

144
00:20:14,473 --> 00:20:15,906
Not even close

145
00:20:16,008 --> 00:20:17,908
Ten! I'll payyou ten!

146
00:20:22,981 --> 00:20:24,380
Twenty ryo!

147
00:20:26,852 --> 00:20:28,251
Twenty-five ryo!

148
00:20:33,892 --> 00:20:35,291
Thirty ryo!

149
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:38,560
All right!

150
00:20:38,664 --> 00:20:40,063
Fifty ryo!

151
00:20:47,105 --> 00:20:48,504
verywell

152
00:20:50,409 --> 00:20:52,309
Twenty-five ryo in advance

153
00:20:52,411 --> 00:20:53,969
With room and board

154
00:21:01,687 --> 00:21:04,952
My men want to paytheir respects

155
00:21:05,057 --> 00:21:06,456
Have a drink

156
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:13,796
Come

157
00:21:16,835 --> 00:21:19,235
She has no manners

158
00:21:52,571 --> 00:21:55,540
It's idiotic to pay 25 ryo 
He's a nobody

159
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,733
He may run off

160
00:21:59,845 --> 00:22:01,176
He won't have time to

161
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,181
I'm attacking right away

162
00:22:05,283 --> 00:22:09,879
He got three of Ushitora's men 
They're scared stiff

163
00:22:09,988 --> 00:22:13,446
We'll win with him leading us

164
00:22:13,558 --> 00:22:15,321
I see

165
00:22:15,427 --> 00:22:19,227
But then we'd have to pay him
25 ryo more

166
00:22:19,331 --> 00:22:24,530
We'd save the whole 50 ryo
ifwe killed him afterwe win

167
00:22:24,636 --> 00:22:27,230
-That's a dirty trick!
- Be quiet!

168
00:22:27,339 --> 00:22:30,365
Ifyou can't even do that,
forget being the heir

169
00:22:30,475 --> 00:22:32,067
There is no honor amongst gamblers

170
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:34,202
Yes

171
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:38,476
You can't succeed unless you're called
a thief and a killer

172
00:22:38,583 --> 00:22:40,847
You kill the samurai

173
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,792
Let him think he's one ofus,
then stab him in the back  Easy

174
00:22:50,462 --> 00:22:54,193
You have to kill more
to get the men to respectyou

175
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:57,962
But I killed
one ofUshitora's men!

176
00:22:58,069 --> 00:23:00,299
One man! Don't flatteryourself

177
00:23:00,405 --> 00:23:03,841
What are you afraid of?

178
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:06,943
One or 1 00

179
00:23:07,045 --> 00:23:09,411
you only hang once!

180
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:25,128
Here you are 
Twenty-five ryo

181
00:23:35,207 --> 00:23:39,109
Let's drink and get acquainted

182
00:23:39,211 --> 00:23:41,509
My son, Yoichiro

183
00:23:41,613 --> 00:23:43,012
My wife, Orin

184
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:44,342
My four strongest men--

185
00:23:44,449 --> 00:23:47,077
Magotaro, Yahachi

186
00:23:47,185 --> 00:23:50,086
Matsukichi and Sukeju

187
00:23:50,188 --> 00:23:53,282
Where's Instructor Homma?

188
00:23:56,027 --> 00:23:58,587
By the way, what's your name?

189
00:24:01,199 --> 00:24:02,427
Me?

190
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:14,401
Kuwabatake (Mulberry Field) Sanjuro,
age 30

191
00:24:14,513 --> 00:24:15,912
Going on 40, though

192
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:18,482
You're joking!

193
00:24:18,583 --> 00:24:23,350
Sanjuro Kuwabatake should be
good enough  I'm a nobody anyway

194
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:38,833
Not there, teacher

195
00:24:38,937 --> 00:24:40,837
Over here

196
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:42,463
Here will do

197
00:24:42,574 --> 00:24:46,476
He gets 50 ryo, and I only get
1 ryo, 2 bu  He's in a different class

198
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:52,177
Someday I'll showyou what I can do

199
00:24:52,284 --> 00:24:54,980
Show me today!

200
00:24:57,389 --> 00:25:01,348
We raid at noon today!

201
00:25:02,761 --> 00:25:04,319
In plain daylight?

202
00:25:04,429 --> 00:25:09,492
We haven'twon
until we kill Ushitora and Inokichi

203
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:12,035
They might get away!

204
00:25:14,873 --> 00:25:16,500
Don't be afraid

205
00:25:16,608 --> 00:25:21,944
We can't lose with him
and the fencing teacher

206
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:55,012
1 2 o'clock noon!

207
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:15,064
Hurry up! What are you doing?

208
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:23,134
You can't sneak away!

209
00:26:25,744 --> 00:26:27,803
We paid a lot foryou!

210
00:26:29,114 --> 00:26:30,513
Get in!

211
00:26:42,994 --> 00:26:44,552
Give us a hand

212
00:27:33,044 --> 00:27:35,945
Hurry up!
Ushitora's men have come out!

213
00:28:10,715 --> 00:28:12,148
Everyone follow him!

214
00:28:20,058 --> 00:28:23,494
Ifyou're going to fight,
do ityourself  I refuse

215
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:29,366
Sorry  I don'twant to get killed
afteryou win

216
00:28:29,467 --> 00:28:31,628
Here's your 25 ryo

217
00:28:31,736 --> 00:28:34,569
He's chickening out in the last minute!

218
00:28:34,672 --> 00:28:36,572
Where's Homma?

219
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,642
- Get him! Hurry!
- He ran away

220
00:28:38,743 --> 00:28:39,971
In broad daylight

221
00:28:46,985 --> 00:28:48,919
Who ofyou is Ushitora?

222
00:28:52,724 --> 00:28:54,316
Me

223
00:28:54,425 --> 00:28:56,017
What do you want?

224
00:28:56,861 --> 00:28:59,989
I cut myties with Seibei

225
00:29:08,506 --> 00:29:09,734
That's all

226
00:29:32,096 --> 00:29:34,496
Watch out! A fight!

227
00:29:46,878 --> 00:29:50,109
Get going! Don't back out now!

228
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:35,812
An official inspection!

229
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:51,601
You lucky dog!

230
00:31:51,703 --> 00:31:55,799
You're the lucky one!
I won't kill you until he goes!

231
00:31:56,941 --> 00:31:59,535
All you fugitives better hide!

232
00:32:00,345 --> 00:32:02,472
The same for our side!

233
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:05,378
Have all the doors opened!

234
00:32:05,483 --> 00:32:09,044
Everything's peaceful here!
Not even a dog fight!

235
00:32:14,459 --> 00:32:15,892
Open up!

236
00:32:15,994 --> 00:32:18,895
Open shop!
Act as ifnothing's happened!

237
00:32:56,768 --> 00:33:00,329
A country official's not much,
but he's got a fine carriage

238
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:16,745
What's funny?

239
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:19,414
His men are drinking tea

240
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:20,923
What ofit?

241
00:33:22,260 --> 00:33:23,659
Look

242
00:33:34,238 --> 00:33:36,138
Spiked tea

243
00:33:41,913 --> 00:33:43,813
Don't be so angry

244
00:33:47,485 --> 00:33:54,789
Good riddance ifthey had
killed each other off

245
00:33:56,094 --> 00:33:57,652
Too bad theywere interrupted

246
00:33:57,762 --> 00:34:00,595
Get out!
You and your crazy ideas!

247
00:34:00,698 --> 00:34:01,926
Think so?

248
00:34:02,033 --> 00:34:06,493
Thinkyou'll get away
with whatyou did?

249
00:34:06,604 --> 00:34:09,038
Theywon't take it!

250
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:13,167
No, they'll come to say something

251
00:34:13,277 --> 00:34:17,179
Question is,
who'll bring a pile ofmoney first?

252
00:34:18,449 --> 00:34:21,247
They're set on winning

253
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:23,479
so they both want me

254
00:34:26,124 --> 00:34:28,024
Just wait and see

255
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,900
So that's Tazaemon, the drummer?

256
00:36:10,261 --> 00:36:11,353
Tokuemon?

257
00:36:47,365 --> 00:36:53,065
No wonder that official
has such an expensive carriage

258
00:36:58,075 --> 00:37:01,238
By the way,
I'd like a drink too

259
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:03,745
You have no money!

260
00:37:37,848 --> 00:37:39,247
Do you want something?

261
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:44,912
You're quite a character 
I like you

262
00:37:46,857 --> 00:37:49,587
You're not mad
I killed three ofyour men?

263
00:37:49,694 --> 00:37:52,595
They're nothing

264
00:37:52,697 --> 00:37:54,597
I'm Ushitora's brother--

265
00:37:54,699 --> 00:37:57,259
- Inokichi 
- You know me?

266
00:37:58,502 --> 00:38:00,732
I hear you're strong

267
00:38:00,838 --> 00:38:02,738
Not that strong

268
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,740
Why, Instructor!

269
00:38:06,744 --> 00:38:10,373
We're friends 
Drink at our place

270
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:12,540
Or are you still mad?

271
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,982
- Aren't you mad? 
- You're mean

272
00:38:15,086 --> 00:38:19,489
I was only joking, you mean man 
Let's go

273
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:22,957
No way!
We're having a drink!

274
00:38:23,060 --> 00:38:24,288
Right?

275
00:38:24,395 --> 00:38:26,090
Bring the sake!

276
00:38:26,197 --> 00:38:28,256
The best  My treat

277
00:38:28,366 --> 00:38:31,802
No! My brother would beat me up!

278
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:34,962
I'd be kicked out ofthe house!

279
00:38:35,072 --> 00:38:35,970
Bitch!

280
00:38:36,073 --> 00:38:37,131
What?

281
00:39:04,568 --> 00:39:06,468
Hey, Cooper 
Drowning your sorrows in sake?

282
00:39:11,709 --> 00:39:15,975
No business with the official here
so long, right?

283
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,514
You've stayed ten days already yourself

284
00:39:18,616 --> 00:39:20,777
Don't say that

285
00:39:20,885 --> 00:39:23,183
I've made your place popular

286
00:39:23,287 --> 00:39:26,188
Be quiet 
This isn't a brothel

287
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,020
Ifyou want to stay,
go to Seibei's place

288
00:39:29,126 --> 00:39:34,359
That's bad policy
when both sides want me

289
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:38,801
I'll stay and get their hopes up

290
00:39:58,189 --> 00:40:00,282
Everybody else out

291
00:40:25,649 --> 00:40:27,549
Come to my place  Now

292
00:40:29,153 --> 00:40:31,053
Whythe rush?

293
00:40:32,289 --> 00:40:34,689
The official will leave tomorrow

294
00:40:36,794 --> 00:40:40,389
An officerwas killed in a town
24 miles from here

295
00:40:44,502 --> 00:40:47,164
He's taking the news well, it seems

296
00:40:47,271 --> 00:40:49,671
He won't get a report until tonight

297
00:40:51,041 --> 00:40:53,032
You know already?

298
00:40:55,479 --> 00:40:58,471
You had the officer killed?

299
00:40:59,683 --> 00:41:01,583
Maybe

300
00:41:03,053 --> 00:41:05,954
His staying here costs a lot

301
00:41:06,056 --> 00:41:08,286
So do my hired men

302
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,551
I see

303
00:41:11,662 --> 00:41:15,029
Here's 30 ryo in advance

304
00:41:16,233 --> 00:41:19,498
Thirty more ifl win 
Come right away

305
00:41:19,603 --> 00:41:23,630
Not until I give Seibei
a fair chance

306
00:41:23,741 --> 00:41:27,199
Taking advantage ofpeople

307
00:41:27,311 --> 00:41:29,336
Too bad

308
00:41:29,446 --> 00:41:32,472
I'll decide my price
afterthe official leaves

309
00:41:48,232 --> 00:41:51,599
Be happy 
The official's leaving

310
00:41:51,702 --> 00:41:53,932
Is that true? 
Am I glad!

311
00:42:07,651 --> 00:42:09,915
What did Ushitora come for?

312
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:16,721
The killing is going to begin again?

313
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:19,995
Looks like it

314
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:40,849
They're late

315
00:42:40,951 --> 00:42:43,886
It's about time someone came
to offer me a price

316
00:42:45,055 --> 00:42:47,956
A samurai
and always harping about money

317
00:42:49,326 --> 00:42:53,126
It's dangerous and dirty work 
It's onlyworth it for a high price

318
00:42:54,231 --> 00:42:56,392
You'll only be a bodyguard

319
00:42:57,801 --> 00:43:03,706
With some bodyguards
the employers have to watch their back

320
00:43:29,867 --> 00:43:34,634
What's he running
up and down the street for?

321
00:43:46,417 --> 00:43:48,783
Gonji  A bottle ofsake

322
00:43:48,886 --> 00:43:52,049
Not forthe cooperto celebrate

323
00:43:52,156 --> 00:43:54,386
I'm not! I'm desperate!

324
00:43:55,726 --> 00:43:58,126
They're making up

325
00:44:00,631 --> 00:44:03,293
And I have a lot of coffin material

326
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,833
Whatwill I do?

327
00:44:06,370 --> 00:44:10,272
Too bad foryou,
but the town will quiet down

328
00:44:10,374 --> 00:44:11,932
Idiot!

329
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:15,205
Gamblers make peace
to get ready for a bigger fight

330
00:44:16,647 --> 00:44:19,207
Ifthere's fighting,
there's no silk fair

331
00:44:19,316 --> 00:44:21,443
No silk fair, no gambling

332
00:44:21,552 --> 00:44:25,147
To keep theirterritory intact,
they make up

333
00:44:25,255 --> 00:44:29,214
It only leads to a bigger fight 
Understand?

334
00:44:31,395 --> 00:44:33,886
There's nothing as dangerous as that

335
00:44:37,434 --> 00:44:41,928
But they should be focused
on winning right now

336
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,572
Why did they patch things up?

337
00:44:45,676 --> 00:44:48,338
I think Unosuke suggested it

338
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:52,547
Ushitora's youngest brother 
He got back last night

339
00:44:52,649 --> 00:44:54,048
He's a bad one

340
00:44:55,319 --> 00:45:00,985
Like his name,
he looks as timid as a rabbit

341
00:45:01,091 --> 00:45:03,787
but he's a wolfinside

342
00:45:08,565 --> 00:45:11,466
A year 
Even the winds welcome you!

343
00:45:48,305 --> 00:45:50,865
Do you want
to see something interesting?

344
00:46:21,338 --> 00:46:23,431
Your place too?

345
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:25,303
It's an insult!

346
00:46:25,409 --> 00:46:29,106
They made up, so they fired us
with a measly sum!

347
00:46:30,247 --> 00:46:31,646
Damn it!

348
00:46:33,584 --> 00:46:35,484
We'll showthem!

349
00:46:52,035 --> 00:46:54,435
They got no cause to complain

350
00:46:55,706 --> 00:47:01,303
He made us do dangerous work

351
00:47:02,412 --> 00:47:03,572
onlyyesterday at that!

352
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:05,079
Be quiet!

353
00:47:10,153 --> 00:47:15,386
But it's a little too much

354
00:47:16,627 --> 00:47:20,961
Let's report Ushitora

355
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:32,470
Stand up  Let's go!

356
00:48:11,548 --> 00:48:14,210
Ushitora's a hard one

357
00:48:14,318 --> 00:48:16,218
What do you mean?

358
00:48:16,320 --> 00:48:20,780
Did you get a gold piece
for killing that officer?

359
00:48:20,891 --> 00:48:24,452
No! Onlytwo silver pieces

360
00:48:28,632 --> 00:48:30,532
A rough deal

361
00:48:31,735 --> 00:48:33,635
But I'm glad you told me

362
00:48:35,172 --> 00:48:38,039
You're a gold mine

363
00:48:38,141 --> 00:48:41,702
Now I can sell you to Seibei
or use you to blackmail Ushitora

364
00:48:56,626 --> 00:48:58,025
Get up

365
00:49:00,564 --> 00:49:01,963
Get up!

366
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:28,747
It's a bargain

367
00:49:31,028 --> 00:49:34,191
Ifyou take them
and report it to the officials,

368
00:49:34,297 --> 00:49:36,492
you'll be rid ofUshitora

369
00:49:41,104 --> 00:49:43,664
What about the alliance?

370
00:49:43,774 --> 00:49:47,335
The young boss and Unosuke
are talking right now

371
00:49:47,444 --> 00:49:49,275
What ofit?

372
00:49:49,379 --> 00:49:52,940
Not bad ifhe gets arrested
during the talks

373
00:50:05,195 --> 00:50:07,925
Are you ready?

374
00:50:39,162 --> 00:50:41,494
Lonesome?

375
00:50:41,598 --> 00:50:43,998
Take your pick and have fun

376
00:50:45,268 --> 00:50:46,667
I have to be careful

377
00:50:50,841 --> 00:50:52,331
Wait!

378
00:50:52,442 --> 00:50:54,842
Take care ofyour purchase

379
00:50:54,945 --> 00:50:57,846
Itwould be a total loss
ifUshitora gets them back

380
00:50:57,948 --> 00:51:00,849
Lock them up in the warehouse

381
00:51:17,834 --> 00:51:19,734
I want to see Ushitora

382
00:51:21,338 --> 00:51:23,238
Who is it?

383
00:51:27,911 --> 00:51:29,310
Ushitora!

384
00:51:34,317 --> 00:51:36,512
Boss! Boss!

385
00:51:36,620 --> 00:51:38,019
What is it?

386
00:51:45,896 --> 00:51:48,456
It's you, is it?

387
00:51:48,565 --> 00:51:50,829
I don't need a bodyguard

388
00:51:50,934 --> 00:51:53,960
Too bad you missed out
getting 60 ryo

389
00:51:54,070 --> 00:51:56,561
Hachi talks too much

390
00:51:58,441 --> 00:52:02,400
Ifyou skimp in pay,
you end up having to pay more later

391
00:52:04,414 --> 00:52:07,212
You paid him a measly sum,

392
00:52:07,317 --> 00:52:11,617
so he got drunkwith Kuma
and talked too much

393
00:52:11,721 --> 00:52:15,521
The rascals!
Where are they?

394
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:19,356
One ofSeibei's men overheard them
and captured them

395
00:52:19,462 --> 00:52:22,863
I followed 
They are locked up

396
00:52:24,467 --> 00:52:26,492
Damn it!

397
00:52:26,603 --> 00:52:29,094
This information is too good
for it to be free

398
00:52:34,444 --> 00:52:37,607
Take as much as you want

399
00:52:37,714 --> 00:52:39,773
You're my bodyguard from now on

400
00:52:45,722 --> 00:52:47,417
This is enough for now

401
00:52:47,524 --> 00:52:49,321
I'll think about being a bodyguard

402
00:52:55,599 --> 00:52:59,501
I guess you don't know 
He's awfully strong

403
00:53:08,311 --> 00:53:11,212
Ino! Uno!
What are you doing?  Come quick!

404
00:53:41,678 --> 00:53:43,578
Don't kill Yoichiro!

405
00:53:49,019 --> 00:53:51,920
Get his sword
and take him to Brother!

406
00:54:19,649 --> 00:54:25,349
Seibei! We have Yoichiro!
Did you hear me?

407
00:54:25,455 --> 00:54:28,652
Ifyou did,
keep still and listen!

408
00:54:28,758 --> 00:54:35,027
Ifyou want to save him,
bring Kuma and Hachi! We'll exchange!

409
00:54:35,131 --> 00:54:40,228
Bring three unarmed men at 3:00 a m 
in front ofthe guard box! Got it?

410
00:54:52,515 --> 00:54:54,813
- Pretty good 
- Itwill only get better

411
00:54:54,918 --> 00:54:56,317
Watch

412
00:55:00,824 --> 00:55:03,384
Don't forget to clap at 3:00!

413
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:13,963
Give me something to eat

414
00:55:14,070 --> 00:55:16,800
Eat what you want

415
00:55:16,906 --> 00:55:20,865
Nobody's coming to eat such things
for a while

416
00:55:25,782 --> 00:55:31,220
This town is beginning to boil again,
just like this pot

417
00:55:33,990 --> 00:55:36,857
Why did you come here?

418
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,588
Is this scenario part ofyour plan?

419
00:55:39,696 --> 00:55:41,323
Half ofit

420
00:55:41,431 --> 00:55:43,763
Unosuke changed the other half

421
00:55:58,114 --> 00:56:03,017
3 o'clock!

422
00:56:21,237 --> 00:56:23,296
Ready, Ushitora?

423
00:56:23,406 --> 00:56:27,035
We're coming, Seibei!

424
00:57:30,473 --> 00:57:34,967
I'll push them,
so let go ofyour rope too

425
00:57:44,053 --> 00:57:49,184
Seibei, you played a dirty trick

426
00:57:49,292 --> 00:57:51,453
We're even now

427
00:57:51,561 --> 00:57:53,552
Ifyou love him,

428
00:57:53,663 --> 00:57:58,032
shave your head
and ask Brotherto be boss

429
00:57:58,134 --> 00:58:00,261
I thought so!

430
00:58:00,370 --> 00:58:03,498
Uno, look!

431
00:58:22,425 --> 00:58:25,326
Say, Ushitora, do you see her?

432
00:58:25,428 --> 00:58:31,230
I'll keep her!
Askyour old brewer how he likes that!

433
00:58:49,986 --> 00:58:51,977
very interesting

434
00:59:49,445 --> 00:59:50,844
Mother!

435
00:59:58,721 --> 01:00:00,552
Where is she?

436
01:00:06,529 --> 01:00:08,827
I'll showyou

437
01:00:33,389 --> 01:00:35,949
What aboutyou?

438
01:01:16,232 --> 01:01:17,927
I can't see her!

439
01:01:18,034 --> 01:01:20,195
Pretty soon now

440
01:01:26,776 --> 01:01:28,437
Mother!

441
01:01:43,793 --> 01:01:45,192
Son!

442
01:02:00,510 --> 01:02:03,206
Hansuke! Hurry up!

443
01:02:08,551 --> 01:02:10,781
Mother!

444
01:02:10,887 --> 01:02:14,015
Coward, why didn't you
bite your tongue off and die?

445
01:02:14,123 --> 01:02:17,286
You caused so much trouble!

446
01:02:41,617 --> 01:02:47,385
Seibei, I'll settle things
with you later!

447
01:02:48,424 --> 01:02:52,485
Sure! I'll even things up with you

448
01:02:58,601 --> 01:03:00,660
Come closer

449
01:03:15,151 --> 01:03:17,915
He cried himselfto sleep

450
01:03:26,128 --> 01:03:30,861
He's an unlucky fellow 
His wife was too beautiful

451
01:03:31,968 --> 01:03:36,234
He gambled and lost to Ushitora

452
01:03:36,339 --> 01:03:41,003
Ifshe were ugly,
he'd have lost only his house

453
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:45,740
But old Tokuemon had his eye on her

454
01:03:45,848 --> 01:03:49,375
So Ushitora used her
to win him over

455
01:03:49,485 --> 01:03:54,889
Took the wife and the house
to dangle before Tokuemon

456
01:03:56,225 --> 01:04:00,252
So he built a hut
near his old place

457
01:04:00,363 --> 01:04:06,097
He watches helplessly as Tokuemon
calls on his wife every day

458
01:04:06,202 --> 01:04:10,366
I don'twant her anymore!
I gave herto him!

459
01:04:10,473 --> 01:04:13,840
Your sad face betrays you

460
01:04:21,350 --> 01:04:23,841
Going home?

461
01:04:23,953 --> 01:04:29,687
Won'tyou get beaten up? 
Weren't you told not to see her?

462
01:04:29,792 --> 01:04:33,819
I'm used to it  I don't mind

463
01:04:44,807 --> 01:04:50,677
Ushitora has men guard his place 
She can't even see her son

464
01:04:59,522 --> 01:05:02,821
I hate his kind! Makes me sick!

465
01:05:44,633 --> 01:05:48,194
I've decided to be your bodyguard

466
01:05:48,304 --> 01:05:50,238
That's great!

467
01:05:51,907 --> 01:05:53,807
An advance  30 ryo

468
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,869
A stiffprice  I'd refuse

469
01:05:58,981 --> 01:06:01,541
He's awfully strong!

470
01:06:05,154 --> 01:06:06,621
Beat this?

471
01:06:06,722 --> 01:06:11,159
Don't say that 
If I refuse, he'll go to Seibei

472
01:06:11,260 --> 01:06:13,160
Thatwould be bad!

473
01:06:15,197 --> 01:06:17,165
Buy him then!

474
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:23,398
Here, 30 ryo

475
01:06:26,375 --> 01:06:29,173
Thirty more when we win

476
01:06:29,278 --> 01:06:31,303
You have myword

477
01:06:31,414 --> 01:06:35,646
Ifit's settled,
let's drink to it

478
01:06:35,751 --> 01:06:39,243
Fine, but is the woman safe?

479
01:06:39,355 --> 01:06:40,879
Woman?

480
01:06:40,990 --> 01:06:46,223
Tokuemon's woman  Ifthey get her again,
you'll lose for sure

481
01:06:46,328 --> 01:06:49,422
Don't worry 
Six strong men are on watch

482
01:06:49,532 --> 01:06:54,526
Not enough  Ifthere was
someone as strong as him--

483
01:06:56,439 --> 01:06:58,771
Shall I go?

484
01:07:00,042 --> 01:07:03,739
I'll go, too,
and see how they're doing

485
01:07:03,846 --> 01:07:05,245
Thanks

486
01:07:07,516 --> 01:07:09,541
Not a pleasant job

487
01:07:09,652 --> 01:07:14,385
You have to stay out in the cold
when Tokuemon is here

488
01:07:17,793 --> 01:07:21,092
He doesn't seem to be here now

489
01:07:21,197 --> 01:07:25,896
The fool who lost his wife
lives there?

490
01:07:26,001 --> 01:07:29,061
Yes! I've got to beat him up

491
01:07:33,309 --> 01:07:38,406
Hey, you!
Whatwere you doing around her?

492
01:07:38,514 --> 01:07:41,847
You had orders to keep away!

493
01:07:43,486 --> 01:07:46,512
Say, Ino, everybody's dead!

494
01:07:47,356 --> 01:07:51,053
All six men have been killed!
Report it!

495
01:07:58,767 --> 01:08:00,234
Who is it?

496
01:08:14,316 --> 01:08:16,841
You're free! Get dressed!

497
01:08:22,558 --> 01:08:24,025
Idiot!

498
01:08:29,398 --> 01:08:30,797
Mother!

499
01:08:36,639 --> 01:08:39,972
Hurry! Get out!

500
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:43,306
Thirty ryo!
I got it from Ushitora! Take it!

501
01:10:10,699 --> 01:10:13,395
You idiots! Hurry up!

502
01:10:19,208 --> 01:10:24,612
Stop it! I hate pathetic people!
I'll kill you ifyou cry!

503
01:10:27,016 --> 01:10:30,076
It's Ushitora!

504
01:10:32,821 --> 01:10:34,584
Go!

505
01:10:34,690 --> 01:10:36,214
We'll thankyou later

506
01:10:36,325 --> 01:10:38,691
Stupid! Don't come back!

507
01:10:38,794 --> 01:10:42,491
Thankyou! Thankyou!

508
01:10:54,610 --> 01:10:55,838
What's up?

509
01:10:55,944 --> 01:10:57,343
Look

510
01:11:06,855 --> 01:11:08,379
A mess

511
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:17,559
I told you six men weren't enough

512
01:11:23,005 --> 01:11:26,907
Looks like 1 5 or 1 6 men did it

513
01:11:32,081 --> 01:11:33,639
Where's the woman?

514
01:11:33,749 --> 01:11:36,115
Gone

515
01:11:36,218 --> 01:11:38,118
Seibei's pretty clever

516
01:11:42,658 --> 01:11:44,057
Brother!

517
01:11:54,903 --> 01:11:58,737
It'll burn up!
My silkwill burn!

518
01:11:58,841 --> 01:12:01,639
Put the fire out!
I'll reward you!

519
01:12:03,011 --> 01:12:04,911
Don't move!

520
01:12:09,651 --> 01:12:11,983
Return the woman!

521
01:12:12,087 --> 01:12:14,385
What?  What woman?

522
01:12:14,490 --> 01:12:17,220
Don't pretend!
Return her or else!

523
01:12:17,326 --> 01:12:19,123
Return her?  But--

524
01:12:19,228 --> 01:12:20,957
Quiet!

525
01:12:50,592 --> 01:12:53,686
The sake's all leaking out!

526
01:12:53,796 --> 01:12:56,162
It's the end!

527
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:03,562
Stop up the holes!

528
01:13:05,574 --> 01:13:08,134
I'll give you anything!

529
01:13:25,060 --> 01:13:27,654
It's that Seibei!

530
01:13:30,232 --> 01:13:32,700
Come on, men!

531
01:14:25,354 --> 01:14:29,347
Why are you looking so gloomy?

532
01:14:31,827 --> 01:14:33,488
Business should be booming

533
01:14:33,595 --> 01:14:39,431
No, when a fight gets too big,
they don't botherwith coffins

534
01:14:56,685 --> 01:14:58,346
One more

535
01:14:58,453 --> 01:15:00,444
Sure

536
01:15:00,556 --> 01:15:03,650
You're so nice today 
What's up?

537
01:15:06,028 --> 01:15:08,121
It's weird

538
01:15:09,398 --> 01:15:12,799
You're not angry
that I'm Ushitora's bodyguard?

539
01:15:12,901 --> 01:15:14,300
No

540
01:15:19,441 --> 01:15:21,841
You're all right

541
01:15:24,646 --> 01:15:29,549
You just act like you're bad

542
01:15:29,651 --> 01:15:32,381
He came last night

543
01:15:32,487 --> 01:15:33,715
Who?

544
01:15:33,822 --> 01:15:36,518
The man who makes you sick

545
01:15:36,625 --> 01:15:41,028
He told me

546
01:15:42,864 --> 01:15:46,766
He said to give you this

547
01:15:50,505 --> 01:15:52,530
You're not going to read it?

548
01:15:52,641 --> 01:15:57,044
Just a thank you note, I know

549
01:15:57,145 --> 01:16:00,603
But read it 
He took a risk bringing it

550
01:16:00,716 --> 01:16:03,651
Shut up! I'm busy drinking!

551
01:16:15,964 --> 01:16:19,525
Aword with you

552
01:16:19,635 --> 01:16:21,034
What?

553
01:16:25,507 --> 01:16:30,171
Ino went to hire men
and just got back

554
01:16:31,279 --> 01:16:32,837
Get any?

555
01:16:32,948 --> 01:16:34,506
No

556
01:16:34,616 --> 01:16:40,350
No wonder  No man who worked foryou
would be singing your praises

557
01:16:40,455 --> 01:16:46,360
But Ino heard an interesting story
from one man

558
01:16:46,461 --> 01:16:52,297
Tokuemon's woman was seen
with her husband and their kid

559
01:16:53,702 --> 01:16:56,967
This was the morning after
the six men were killed

560
01:17:00,475 --> 01:17:04,809
That means Seibei
didn't kidnap her

561
01:17:06,148 --> 01:17:07,843
Seems so

562
01:17:08,984 --> 01:17:11,953
Then who killed the men?

563
01:17:14,056 --> 01:17:19,050
Ino, did you really
see the men dead

564
01:17:19,161 --> 01:17:22,130
before you came to tell Brother?

565
01:17:22,230 --> 01:17:25,427
No  He told me--

566
01:17:36,812 --> 01:17:42,580
Only a strong swordsman
could have killed them like that

567
01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:47,619
You're the only man around here
who's that strong

568
01:17:49,891 --> 01:17:51,256
So?

569
01:17:52,527 --> 01:17:58,989
I just thought maybe
it was you who killed them

570
01:17:59,101 --> 01:18:03,561
But he's our bodyguard

571
01:18:03,672 --> 01:18:05,572
Why would he--

572
01:18:07,943 --> 01:18:11,845
That's what I don't
understand either

573
01:18:14,349 --> 01:18:15,748
Wait!

574
01:18:17,085 --> 01:18:19,246
What's this?

575
01:18:21,389 --> 01:18:26,850
To the samurai? 
From Kohei and Nui

576
01:19:18,580 --> 01:19:22,414
Shouldn'twe tie him up?

577
01:19:22,517 --> 01:19:25,748
No, as long as he doesn't have a sword

578
01:19:28,924 --> 01:19:31,950
Where am I?

579
01:19:32,060 --> 01:19:34,221
The brewery

580
01:19:34,329 --> 01:19:36,695
The gate to hell

581
01:19:36,798 --> 01:19:42,031
Be careful! A pat from you
hurts as much as a blow

582
01:20:00,856 --> 01:20:03,450
Do you want to get busted again?

583
01:20:21,843 --> 01:20:27,543
Where are you going? 
That's a shortcut to hell!

584
01:20:34,522 --> 01:20:36,717
Don't kill him!

585
01:20:36,825 --> 01:20:39,885
Don't worry  He's groaning

586
01:21:07,022 --> 01:21:09,388
Do you know who I am?

587
01:21:11,359 --> 01:21:16,854
Then listen  He wants
to talk to you personally

588
01:21:21,703 --> 01:21:27,573
Do you really know
where the woman is?

589
01:21:32,414 --> 01:21:36,544
You can't count on it 
He's trying to save his own skin

590
01:21:36,651 --> 01:21:39,814
He's talking  You keep quiet

591
01:21:46,561 --> 01:21:49,257
I hate long drawn-out talks

592
01:21:49,364 --> 01:21:53,130
The sooner things
are settled, the better

593
01:21:55,036 --> 01:22:01,305
Tell me where the woman is

594
01:22:01,409 --> 01:22:03,900
I'll letyou live

595
01:22:06,815 --> 01:22:11,149
What's the matter?  You're lucky

596
01:22:11,252 --> 01:22:13,686
You're not going to refuse, are you?

597
01:22:15,457 --> 01:22:17,391
I won't talk!

598
01:22:22,430 --> 01:22:24,625
Say! Don't kill him!

599
01:22:24,733 --> 01:22:28,760
Don't worry  Do your stuff

600
01:22:39,714 --> 01:22:42,410
How about it? 
Are you going to talk?

601
01:22:42,517 --> 01:22:45,077
No, you fathead!

602
01:22:58,900 --> 01:23:01,334
Don't kill him!

603
01:23:03,571 --> 01:23:07,029
Don't get the chest bloody!

604
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:39,059
Thanks to him,
we have to sleep here now

605
01:25:39,160 --> 01:25:42,254
I need to bust him some more!

606
01:25:48,937 --> 01:25:53,067
I'm sure I shut this door

607
01:25:53,174 --> 01:25:55,574
Say, he's gone!

608
01:25:55,677 --> 01:25:57,941
What?  Don't scare me!

609
01:26:04,018 --> 01:26:07,283
Brother, this isn't a joke!

610
01:27:53,695 --> 01:27:58,689
Idiots! No point in looking where
it's light! Search where it's dark!

611
01:29:27,822 --> 01:29:33,351
Old man, open up! It's me

612
01:29:47,141 --> 01:29:52,545
I know I'm quite a spectacle,
but do your looking later

613
01:30:15,136 --> 01:30:18,799
I told you so, didn't I? 
You're so reckless

614
01:30:18,906 --> 01:30:22,808
Save your lecture!
They'll be coming soon!

615
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:29,372
Tell them I went to Seibei's place

616
01:30:45,533 --> 01:30:48,866
Did he come? 
Lie and you'll be sorry!

617
01:30:48,970 --> 01:30:52,497
He came,
but he went to Seibei's place

618
01:30:52,607 --> 01:30:57,442
Don't believe him 
They're two of a kind

619
01:30:57,545 --> 01:31:01,311
Ifhe asked him, Seibei would help

620
01:31:01,415 --> 01:31:05,408
He's something else  He wouldn't
stay putwith his head cut off

621
01:31:05,520 --> 01:31:09,012
We'll massacre Seibei's bunch!

622
01:31:09,123 --> 01:31:11,648
I held back because ofthe woman!

623
01:31:11,759 --> 01:31:14,887
Gather straw and smoke them out!

624
01:31:14,996 --> 01:31:19,558
Smoke them out like raccoons,
then kill them?  That's great!

625
01:31:48,329 --> 01:31:52,197
Pull yourselftogether

626
01:31:53,301 --> 01:31:56,737
What will you do now?

627
01:31:56,837 --> 01:32:00,238
Go and buy a coffin

628
01:32:00,341 --> 01:32:03,435
Don't give up

629
01:32:03,544 --> 01:32:05,842
Idiot!

630
01:32:05,947 --> 01:32:08,279
I'm not dying yet

631
01:32:08,382 --> 01:32:11,112
I have to kill quite a few men first

632
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:42,807
Is it safe? 
IfUshitora checks--

633
01:32:42,917 --> 01:32:46,148
They're too busy 
Take a look

634
01:32:46,253 --> 01:32:48,915
Ushitora?

635
01:32:49,023 --> 01:32:52,049
Smoking out Seibei's place

636
01:32:52,159 --> 01:32:55,788
Sounds interesting 
Let me down  I'll watch

637
01:32:55,896 --> 01:32:57,261
But--

638
01:32:57,365 --> 01:32:59,799
Let me down!

639
01:33:06,607 --> 01:33:10,270
I can't see here  Over there

640
01:34:22,183 --> 01:34:24,083
It's me! Don't shoot!

641
01:34:27,088 --> 01:34:29,181
Stay where you are!

642
01:34:29,290 --> 01:34:32,623
- The wrestler's there  Brother? 
- What?

643
01:34:32,727 --> 01:34:37,221
I killed the two men
who killed three of ours

644
01:34:37,331 --> 01:34:38,628
Is that all?

645
01:34:38,733 --> 01:34:40,132
Go!

646
01:34:54,782 --> 01:34:56,477
You can't get away!

647
01:34:56,584 --> 01:34:59,451
You greedy bitch!

648
01:34:59,553 --> 01:35:01,646
- Where are Seibei and Yoichiro? 
- I don't know!

649
01:35:01,756 --> 01:35:04,691
I'll kill you!

650
01:35:10,197 --> 01:35:12,097
Mother!

651
01:35:17,872 --> 01:35:21,831
Seibei, come out!
Yoichiro has asked for mercy!

652
01:35:23,744 --> 01:35:25,302
Seibei!

653
01:35:25,412 --> 01:35:29,849
You win! I'm coming out!
Don't kill my son and me!

654
01:35:29,950 --> 01:35:32,180
All right!

655
01:35:36,690 --> 01:35:39,784
All myterritory is yours!

656
01:35:39,894 --> 01:35:43,057
You can take over!

657
01:35:49,937 --> 01:35:52,565
A dirty trick!

658
01:36:08,589 --> 01:36:12,081
Now it's just the samurai

659
01:36:12,193 --> 01:36:13,922
There is nobody in there

660
01:36:14,028 --> 01:36:16,622
That can't be!

661
01:36:16,730 --> 01:36:18,664
He isn't there

662
01:36:18,766 --> 01:36:20,461
He can't vanish

663
01:36:20,568 --> 01:36:23,731
He's a mess  He can't go far

664
01:36:27,408 --> 01:36:31,435
Old man, let's get going

665
01:36:34,648 --> 01:36:37,845
The cooper's run away!

666
01:36:38,953 --> 01:36:41,922
That's a problem 
Anybody around?

667
01:36:43,123 --> 01:36:48,959
It's worse 
Inokichi's coming this way!

668
01:36:49,063 --> 01:36:52,260
Humor him  Make him help

669
01:36:52,366 --> 01:36:53,594
But--

670
01:36:53,701 --> 01:36:56,135
Try it!

671
01:36:59,607 --> 01:37:02,269
-Just in case 
- Thanks

672
01:37:16,657 --> 01:37:19,023
What's up?

673
01:37:19,126 --> 01:37:24,257
We were carrying this body
but the cooper got scared and ran away

674
01:37:24,365 --> 01:37:26,595
Will you help me?

675
01:37:26,700 --> 01:37:29,100
No way  Are you kidding me?

676
01:37:30,204 --> 01:37:32,604
Afraid of dead men?

677
01:37:32,706 --> 01:37:33,764
What?

678
01:37:33,874 --> 01:37:37,105
You're scared 
Your face shows it

679
01:37:37,211 --> 01:37:39,236
I'm not afraid!

680
01:37:39,346 --> 01:37:41,246
Then help me

681
01:37:41,348 --> 01:37:43,145
No big deal

682
01:37:43,250 --> 01:37:47,949
We're going to the cemetery 
Are you afraid of ghosts?

683
01:37:48,055 --> 01:37:52,014
No, they make me feel just great!

684
01:37:52,126 --> 01:37:55,254
Good  Let's go then

685
01:38:12,179 --> 01:38:14,875
Here?

686
01:38:19,954 --> 01:38:22,047
No ghosts!

687
01:38:22,156 --> 01:38:25,648
They appearwhen people
are afraid like me

688
01:38:25,759 --> 01:38:28,592
You're strong

689
01:38:29,863 --> 01:38:34,698
You'll be alone if I go 
I'll help you bury him

690
01:38:34,802 --> 01:38:38,499
Weren'tyou looking for someone?

691
01:38:38,605 --> 01:38:41,699
That's right! I'll get a beating!

692
01:38:58,759 --> 01:39:01,557
Are you all right?

693
01:39:02,763 --> 01:39:04,697
very interesting

694
01:39:04,798 --> 01:39:10,134
Can you walk? 
There's a small temple near here

695
01:39:10,237 --> 01:39:11,636
Yes

696
01:39:21,648 --> 01:39:25,584
You don't look alive

697
01:39:27,888 --> 01:39:31,187
I'll be all right
ifl sleep for a few days

698
01:39:33,494 --> 01:39:36,190
It's worse when you smile

699
01:40:22,342 --> 01:40:25,971
You're late  I'm hungry

700
01:40:27,347 --> 01:40:30,908
It's me!
Gonji's in trouble!

701
01:40:32,920 --> 01:40:34,046
What?

702
01:40:34,154 --> 01:40:39,182
He was caught! The medicine and rice
he had foryou gave him away!

703
01:40:41,795 --> 01:40:43,524
Where is he?

704
01:40:43,630 --> 01:40:47,964
Seibei's place 
Ushitora has moved in there

705
01:40:49,369 --> 01:40:52,099
Are you fighting with that?

706
01:40:52,206 --> 01:40:54,436
- I will!
-Wait

707
01:40:56,176 --> 01:41:00,203
Use this 
A coffin maker gets these

708
01:41:00,314 --> 01:41:04,876
Sorry it's a dead man's sword

709
01:42:48,455 --> 01:42:53,916
Get awaywhile he's fighting
Ushitora and his men

710
01:42:55,028 --> 01:42:59,021
You told him?  You stupid meddler!

711
01:42:59,132 --> 01:43:00,531
Hurry!

712
01:43:53,820 --> 01:43:55,788
Don't come too close!

713
01:44:23,684 --> 01:44:25,515
Mother!

714
01:44:25,619 --> 01:44:32,923
Go home 
A long life eating porridge is best!

715
01:44:41,234 --> 01:44:44,328
You're kind, aren't you?

716
01:44:48,709 --> 01:44:52,236
Do me a favor too

717
01:44:53,347 --> 01:44:55,679
What?

718
01:45:05,058 --> 01:45:08,550
Ifl don't have my pistol

719
01:45:12,032 --> 01:45:15,468
I feel sort ofnaked

720
01:45:15,569 --> 01:45:21,201
I can't die without it

721
01:45:24,111 --> 01:45:29,344
Let me hold it

722
01:45:56,443 --> 01:45:58,775
Don't worry

723
01:45:58,879 --> 01:46:01,643
Itwent offtwice

724
01:46:01,748 --> 01:46:04,114
No more bullets

725
01:46:10,524 --> 01:46:12,424
Thanks!

726
01:46:36,149 --> 01:46:38,413
I can't!

727
01:46:38,518 --> 01:46:43,421
It's becoming dark

728
01:47:41,815 --> 01:47:43,715
Who's praying?

729
01:47:49,623 --> 01:47:54,959
I don't need any prayers

730
01:48:54,387 --> 01:49:00,189
Say, samurai trash, are you there?

731
01:49:01,695 --> 01:49:03,663
I'm here

732
01:49:08,802 --> 01:49:11,930
The entrance to hell

733
01:49:12,038 --> 01:49:19,137
I'll be waiting there for you!

734
01:49:26,586 --> 01:49:30,147
He died as recklessly as he lived

735
01:49:37,297 --> 01:49:38,924
Hansuke!

736
01:49:41,601 --> 01:49:43,034
Yes?

737
01:49:43,136 --> 01:49:44,763
Go hang yourself

738
01:49:55,949 --> 01:50:00,511
Now it'll be quiet in this town

739
01:50:02,889 --> 01:50:04,789
Old man

740
01:50:15,869 --> 01:50:17,268
So long!

741
01:50:27,881 --> 01:50:31,817
