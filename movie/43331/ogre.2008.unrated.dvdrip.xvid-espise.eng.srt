1
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,459
Lord Albert is dead.

2
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,228
He was first with the symptoms.

3
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,172
Amazing he lasted as long as he did.

4
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:30,937
We must choose a new magistrate.

5
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,104
Let us at least bury the man
before we talk of his replacement.

6
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:37,149
We don't have the
luxury of time.

7
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:42,120
Decisions need to be made.
I for one have made mine.

8
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:46,824
Then your lot is cast
with Henry Bartlett.

9
00:03:46,893 --> 00:03:49,418
He is the only one
who offers a solution.

10
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,861
Yes, but the risk is too high.

11
00:03:51,931 --> 00:03:54,161
The risk of doing nothing is worse.

12
00:03:54,234 --> 00:03:56,361
We're dying!
All of us.

13
00:03:56,436 --> 00:03:57,960
How do we know his sorcery

14
00:03:58,037 --> 00:03:59,902
hasn't brought the
pestilence on us?

15
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,463
How could you think that?

16
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:05,033
All I'm saying is that it's
dangerous, he's dangerous.

17
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:09,172
I'm no danger
to you, Franklin.

18
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:10,944
I meant no offense, Bartlett.

19
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:15,716
But this is not rain for our
crops. This is life and death.

20
00:04:17,690 --> 00:04:19,783
You're our magi, Bartlett.

21
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,793
If you can rid the town of the plague,

22
00:04:21,861 --> 00:04:22,850
then let it be done.

23
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:24,123
He speaks for the town.

24
00:04:24,197 --> 00:04:25,494
Not for all of us.

25
00:04:25,565 --> 00:04:26,964
Enough of us.

26
00:04:27,033 --> 00:04:29,297
We'll be dealing with
the darkest of powers.

27
00:04:29,369 --> 00:04:31,428
Even to invoke
such an incantation...

28
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,870
There will be consequences.

29
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,808
Only someone with my mastery will be
able to hold sway over these matters.

30
00:04:37,877 --> 00:04:41,176
And in order to do this, you
feel you need to be magistrate?

31
00:04:41,247 --> 00:04:45,581
If I am to act, Franklin, I must
certainly have full authority to do so.

32
00:04:45,652 --> 00:04:47,643
Sir Henry, sir.

33
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:49,312
You interrupt me, boy!

34
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,913
But, sir, it's
your daughter.

35
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:54,215
Father.

36
00:04:54,294 --> 00:04:55,556
What is it, my child?

37
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:59,894
I have the spots now too.

38
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:04,403
Come with me, my child.

39
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:09,237
As I said, what higher price is there?

40
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:11,300
You must decide.

41
00:05:11,377 --> 00:05:13,038
I, for one, will
not sit idly by

42
00:05:13,112 --> 00:05:15,239
while my daughter
wastes away to nothing.

43
00:05:20,853 --> 00:05:23,117
Then you will accept
the consequences?

44
00:05:23,189 --> 00:05:24,178
Yes.

45
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,246
Yes.

46
00:05:28,528 --> 00:05:31,088
We are not complete
without you, Frankiln.

47
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:33,826
You must speak for
the rest of the town.

48
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:37,497
Yes.

49
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:40,265
Then so be it.

50
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,341
It is done.

51
00:06:33,326 --> 00:06:35,658
No! No!

52
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:39,220
Every year, on this
day of the winter solstice,

53
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:40,697
one of us must be chosen.

54
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:46,972
He will be set at the
center of the town,

55
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,373
the stockade, bound
by chains and shackles.

56
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:53,878
The chosen one will wear a brand,

57
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,247
and he shall wait.

58
00:07:16,135 --> 00:07:18,729
This will protect you
from all that is evil.

59
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,338
The disease, this plague
that I will pull forth

60
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,743
from each and every dying soul
won't be cast out entirely.

61
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,219
Everything evil,
everything malignant,

62
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:41,556
and everything wretched
about what has befallen us,

63
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,494
will rise anew, take shape,

64
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:47,226
a hideous beast spawned
from Hell itself.

65
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:53,296
Our fate is now left to the
mercy of that which must be fed.

66
00:07:53,372 --> 00:07:57,206
This manifestation of our diseases,

67
00:07:57,276 --> 00:08:00,507
what is this hideous
beast you speak of?

68
00:08:05,618 --> 00:08:07,176
The ogre.

69
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:30,936
Ah! Ah!

70
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:42,668
This looks like a good place to camp.

71
00:11:42,735 --> 00:11:44,726
Not yet.

72
00:11:44,804 --> 00:11:47,773
Well, at least we gotta let
the girls catch up anyway.

73
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:49,273
We're getting close.

74
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:52,310
Close to what?
Not a cell tower, that's for sure.

75
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,642
Would you put that away?
We're roughing it.

76
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,911
Roughing it? From the
guy who walks into a tree?

77
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,473
You look like
you got punched out.

78
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:00,883
That tree came
out of nowhere.

79
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:02,921
Put that away!
You're like a child.

80
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,651
A guy can't rough it and still
know the score of the ballgames?

81
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,455
Hold up, Mike.

82
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:11,462
Does that look like the
entrance to a path to you?

83
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:13,623
Where'd you get this thing, anyway?

84
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:14,859
I bought it.

85
00:12:14,934 --> 00:12:16,026
Not off the Internet?

86
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,091
It's authentic.

87
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,772
No, that's not a path.

88
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,206
You don't know,
you don't even care.

89
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:26,506
Hey, I care, I care.

90
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,673
It's a great story.
"A town lost in time."

91
00:12:29,749 --> 00:12:32,980
A fun excuse to go camping.

92
00:12:33,052 --> 00:12:36,818
It's not gonna be any
fun if you don't relax.

93
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,948
I'm relaxed.

94
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:41,390
Jessica, does that
look like a path to you?

95
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,826
No.
Not at all.

96
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,489
Both you guys are no fun.

97
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:52,470
Terry, you know it's unlikely
we'll actually find anything.

98
00:12:52,538 --> 00:12:54,028
There was a town out here.

99
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:58,008
There were lots of towns
out here in the 1850's.

100
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,567
There's documented cases.

101
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:03,308
Documented cases,
Jess. Oh, hey, the book.

102
00:13:03,382 --> 00:13:05,213
Documents!

103
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,448
Look. 1947. Hiker finds a
vintage musket lying in the woods.

104
00:13:09,522 --> 00:13:13,856
Spotless, like brand new.
1964, two hunters are hunting,

105
00:13:13,926 --> 00:13:16,520
and they see people in
Civil War era clothes.

106
00:13:16,595 --> 00:13:19,029
And then those people
simply disappear.

107
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,531
It's written
right there.

108
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:24,262
Okay, I'm done with the trees.

109
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:27,601
Oh God, not the
stupid book again.

110
00:13:27,673 --> 00:13:29,538
Why come if you don't believe this?

111
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:32,668
You know what? You guys are
sucking all the fun out of this.

112
00:13:32,745 --> 00:13:36,545
Okay, Terry,
give me the map.

113
00:13:36,615 --> 00:13:37,604
What? No.

114
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:38,809
Give me
the map.

115
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:39,873
No. Why?

116
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,010
Give me the map!

117
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:50,990
North.

118
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:54,488
There.

119
00:13:58,103 --> 00:14:00,094
Let me see that.

120
00:14:03,776 --> 00:14:06,404
You actually found it!

121
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:07,809
Terry...

122
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,010
If this is the path then
we need to go... Ugh!

123
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:17,582
That was a
spectacular display.

124
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:18,884
You alright?

125
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:24,419
Oh, oh, I can't.
It hurts.

126
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:25,622
Are you really hurt?

127
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:29,227
Oh.

128
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,996
Ooh!

129
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:32,401
Let me see.

130
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,275
Is it broken?

131
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,904
I can feel the edge of the bone.

132
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,108
Great, so what
do we do now?

133
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,478
We are in the middle of nowhere.

134
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,218
So if that's broken, you
can't walk out of here,

135
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:55,658
and we're not gonna get
far dragging your ass.

136
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:57,161
You're serious?

137
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,823
We should be smart.
You guys set up camp.

138
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,390
I'm gonna hike on, see
if I can find anything.

139
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:03,730
Like what?

140
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:05,133
A ranger's station,

141
00:15:05,204 --> 00:15:07,069
a hunting lodge.

142
00:15:07,139 --> 00:15:08,231
I'll go with you.

143
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,774
No, I'll be faster by myself.

144
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:12,902
Let's be safe, buddy system.
We'll split up.

145
00:15:12,978 --> 00:15:17,438
You two set up camp.
We'll be back as soon as we can.

146
00:15:17,516 --> 00:15:21,748
Okay? You guys will be fine.
You guys will be okay together.

147
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:24,050
Don't do anything I wouldn't.

148
00:15:24,123 --> 00:15:26,489
I don't know how
to "set up camp!"

149
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,629
This is great.

150
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,544
What the hell is this?

151
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:54,179
Maybe there is
a town out here.

152
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:56,221
Do you think it's "Ellensford"?

153
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,622
Absolutely. it's also
a UFO fueling station.

154
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,320
Big Foot, the Loch Ness Monster,

155
00:16:02,394 --> 00:16:05,056
they hang out here sometimes.
It's a huge party.

156
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,498
How do you close a town?

157
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,195
You don't.

158
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,966
Mike, it says no trespassing.

159
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:17,236
Yeah, but it doesn't
say "please." You coming?

160
00:16:21,213 --> 00:16:24,614
How do you go on a camping trip and
not even know how to put up a tent?

161
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:25,911
It's an expedition.

162
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,180
They don't put up
tents on expeditions?

163
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,016
What do you think
I bring Mike for?

164
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:32,523
This is ridiculous.
I'm freezing.

165
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,582
I'm sorry.
Next time I'll break my ankle

166
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,424
next to a nice little cottage
with a potbellied stove.

167
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:44,326
What's that?

168
00:16:48,107 --> 00:16:51,599
Mike, what if this is a ghost town?

169
00:16:51,677 --> 00:16:53,770
Like I said,

170
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:56,940
we'll camp for the night and
I'll hike back out in the morning.

171
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,244
Well, it's not a ghost town.

172
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:06,982
Mike, wait! Shhh!
Listen, listen!

173
00:17:12,965 --> 00:17:15,627
...one life for all life...

174
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:21,564
...one life for all life...

175
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,007
Uh, okay, creepy.

176
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,203
Creepy.

177
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:28,644
But it's people.
They could help.

178
00:17:30,282 --> 00:17:31,874
They could be creepy people.

179
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,144
C'mon.

180
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,118
How about we go back.

181
00:17:35,187 --> 00:17:36,814
How about no.

182
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,188
Can you help me up?!

183
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:45,321
Fine.

184
00:17:50,836 --> 00:17:52,360
Oh, I slipped!

185
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,564
Whatever.

186
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,300
Looks like some kind of a trap door.

187
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,471
It's underground.
You're going too fast!

188
00:18:01,547 --> 00:18:03,071
Stop being such a baby!

189
00:18:03,148 --> 00:18:04,479
You're a baby.

190
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,613
I wonder why I never saw this before.

191
00:18:10,689 --> 00:18:12,452
I don't know, it's freaky.

192
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,585
Look at that!

193
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:19,892
What do you
think it is?

194
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,262
I don't know!

195
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,494
It's creepy if you ask me.
Hey, watch it!

196
00:18:23,569 --> 00:18:24,467
You're leading!

197
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,902
Just keep hobbling.

198
00:18:31,543 --> 00:18:33,670
You have got to be kidding me.

199
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,810
It's the symbol, it's burnt in.

200
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,146
Werewolves.

201
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:42,687
No, it's not werewolves.

202
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:45,723
Don't you watch movies? That's
the symbol for a werewolf.

203
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:49,283
In pre-Christian paganism, the
five pointed star was the symbol

204
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:51,921
of the sacred feminine.
Read a book!

205
00:18:51,997 --> 00:18:53,225
You're such a nerd.

206
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,158
What are you doing?

207
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,035
I'm trying to open the door.
What does it...

208
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,596
I'm not going in there.

209
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:07,441
This is the same symbol
that is on the map.

210
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,071
And?

211
00:19:11,049 --> 00:19:14,450
We may have actually found
something connected to Ellensford.

212
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,512
Worst case it's a place
to get out of the cold.

213
00:19:17,589 --> 00:19:20,251
And I'll stop hurting
myself on branches.

214
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:24,284
Ohhh, what is that smell?

215
00:19:24,363 --> 00:19:26,854
I really try to like you,

216
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:29,765
you're hot, but open yourself
to something other than...

217
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:38,939
Terry?

218
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:43,504
Terry?

219
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,416
Well, there is a town.

220
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:23,079
If there's a town,
must be a doctor, right?

221
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:24,645
Let's go.

222
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:51,073
Let me see, let me see.

223
00:20:53,552 --> 00:20:55,452
Shhh!

224
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,953
Many years ago,

225
00:20:57,022 --> 00:20:59,752
a plague took hold of our town.

226
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:03,591
Our young children lost
the very breath of life,

227
00:21:03,662 --> 00:21:06,392
our women lost
their husbands,

228
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:09,866
our men, their
loving wives.

229
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:18,539
What was once a town of
several hundred strong

230
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,340
has been whittled down to
those of us in this room.

231
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:23,176
We are all of who remain.

232
00:21:23,248 --> 00:21:27,548
As we start today's ceremony,

233
00:21:27,619 --> 00:21:30,645
I suggest it is more important
today than ever before

234
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:35,352
to remember the pain and the
suffering that we all endured then,

235
00:21:35,427 --> 00:21:38,487
so that perhaps we might
more fully understand

236
00:21:38,563 --> 00:21:44,798
the pain and suffering that
we must certainly endure today.

237
00:21:46,371 --> 00:21:48,931
Another life, for another year.

238
00:21:49,007 --> 00:21:51,532
So it says in
the sacred pact.

239
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,273
We must ask the orb,

240
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:57,815
as we have in so
many years past,

241
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,976
to give us a name.

242
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:05,547
To tell us who is
the brave heart

243
00:22:05,624 --> 00:22:07,751
that we will offer up.

244
00:22:13,965 --> 00:22:19,494
One life, for all life.

245
00:22:21,406 --> 00:22:24,068
One life, for all life.

246
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,680
Okay, let's go.

247
00:22:36,755 --> 00:22:37,779
Yeah!

248
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,619
Ahh!

249
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:44,651
We have decided, and the
chosen one is Stephen Chandler!

250
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:50,066
We must stop this!
This is wrong. All of you!

251
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:53,764
We must fight the beast!
End the pact!

252
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:57,331
Search your hearts,
you know I am right!

253
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:02,536
No, Father, no!

254
00:23:02,614 --> 00:23:05,447
Let us all offer a blessing
to Stephen Chandler.

255
00:23:05,517 --> 00:23:08,816
May he have strength,
honor and peace.

256
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,549
No, Father, no!

257
00:23:11,623 --> 00:23:14,820
Please Father, no!
Please don't!

258
00:23:14,893 --> 00:23:17,054
Sorry, it's out of my hands!

259
00:24:29,367 --> 00:24:32,393
Okay, guys, this is a
big misunderstanding.

260
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,098
What the hell is your problem?

261
00:24:34,172 --> 00:24:35,400
He is coming.

262
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,463
Who's coming?

263
00:24:41,246 --> 00:24:43,043
Good day, young travelers.

264
00:24:43,114 --> 00:24:46,140
Good day for who?
Are we under arrest?

265
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:48,709
That remains to be seen,
you're trespassing.

266
00:24:48,787 --> 00:24:53,884
I don't know if you're the mayor
or something but we need your help.

267
00:24:53,959 --> 00:24:57,588
It was unwise of you
to ignore our sign.

268
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,493
We didn't see a sign.
What sign?

269
00:24:59,564 --> 00:25:01,896
There is one road in
and out of Ellensford.

270
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:05,801
Otherwise it's surrounded
by forest. You saw our sign.

271
00:25:05,871 --> 00:25:08,431
Did you just say
this is Ellensford?

272
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:13,906
Okay, we're sorry, you
know what, we saw your sign.

273
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:17,779
My friend's hurt. He possibly has
a broken ankle. He needs help...

274
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:19,248
You know what help is?

275
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:21,148
You should've gone
somewhere else.

276
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:23,915
We do not welcome
outsiders in Ellensford.

277
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:27,857
We have no way of knowing
what you have seen or heard.

278
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:32,158
Look, we get it. You've been
hospitable but we're gonna take off.

279
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:34,323
I do not think so, young man.

280
00:25:34,399 --> 00:25:37,960
Now it's impossible for you to leave.

281
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:41,528
I'd like you to take our
guests to the waiting place.

282
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,972
Send men out to get their
friends in the woods,

283
00:25:44,042 --> 00:25:45,441
and bring them to me at once.

284
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,110
Okay, guys.
Run!

285
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:51,170
Ahh!

286
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:57,010
Ahh!

287
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,589
Seriously get your hands off me!

288
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,093
Let go of me!

289
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:04,651
Any idea how many penal codes

290
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:06,253
you broke in the last five minutes?

291
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:10,324
Don't push me! My father's
a prominent attorney.

292
00:26:10,402 --> 00:26:15,237
Okay, you're not even
allowed to do that.

293
00:26:15,307 --> 00:26:16,399
You're not even a cop!

294
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:18,305
You guys are in
so much trouble!

295
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,311
We get a phone call, or
don't you guys have phones!?

296
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,745
It's in Sir Henry's hands now.

297
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:27,808
He makes the rules.
I bid you good luck.

298
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,320
And I bid you an idiot!

299
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,481
Mike, how can they leave us here?

300
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:34,991
I didn't do anything wrong!

301
00:26:35,060 --> 00:26:38,427
Jess, relax, okay.
I'll get us out of here.

302
00:26:38,496 --> 00:26:40,293
Not likely.

303
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:49,397
What'd they get you
for, jaywalking?

304
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,339
Jaywalking?

305
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:54,776
No.

306
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:57,872
I am the Chosen One.

307
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:03,215
That's pretty. Chosen for what?

308
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:06,254
It doesn't matter.

309
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,383
You should not have come here.

310
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,088
Really? Because we didn't
get that sense at all yet.

311
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:14,131
It's all in Sir Henry's hands now.

312
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:15,393
The guy with the stick?

313
00:27:17,102 --> 00:27:18,899
You've got to be kidding me.

314
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:20,938
This is no joke.

315
00:27:21,006 --> 00:27:22,598
You people cannot be serious.

316
00:27:22,674 --> 00:27:24,767
Please, don't be serious.

317
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,174
Is this an actor's hamlet?

318
00:27:26,244 --> 00:27:27,643
This whole thing is a play?

319
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,577
You pretend to be from
this mythical town?

320
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:30,637
Yeah?

321
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,206
I don't understand.

322
00:27:33,284 --> 00:27:36,583
This is no play. No myth.

323
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:39,750
It is our plight.

324
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,315
Ah.

325
00:27:42,394 --> 00:27:45,329
What's the Chosen One?
Chosen for what?

326
00:27:46,931 --> 00:27:48,694
Sacrifice.

327
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:53,665
Ah, okay.
I don't believe this.

328
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,172
Sacrifice? They're gonna kill us?

329
00:27:56,241 --> 00:27:58,232
Offer us to the gods,
that kind of thing?

330
00:27:58,309 --> 00:28:01,710
Not you.
Me.

331
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,476
One life for the
prosperity of the many.

332
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:06,141
You got a bum rap.

333
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:09,778
These are very
serious matters.

334
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:12,186
A powerful spell
governs our land.

335
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,283
Oh, come on?

336
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,123
Come on to what?

337
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:21,154
She doesn't believe any
of this. Neither do I.

338
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,690
Whether you choose
to believe it or not,

339
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:28,034
tomorrow, I will be offered
as the sacrificial meal.

340
00:28:28,106 --> 00:28:30,165
They're gonna
eat you?!

341
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:32,300
Not them.

342
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,175
Okay, who is
gonna eat you?

343
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:37,373
The ogre.

344
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:45,918
Hope, over the years we've
all lost those we love.

345
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,753
Including you and your father.

346
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:50,818
Yes, my mother was one of the first.

347
00:28:50,895 --> 00:28:53,591
I remember it as if it was yesterday.

348
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,656
But at least she
died of the plague.

349
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:58,066
At least she died
of natural causes.

350
00:28:58,136 --> 00:29:01,162
I don't know how natural
the plague was to begin with.

351
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:04,834
Never mind that. I've misspoken.

352
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:08,003
No, I've heard the rumors, Franklin.
I am not deaf.

353
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,242
We were all there that day.

354
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,750
Your father did what he had to do.
We all agreed.

355
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:17,049
You didn't. They forced
your hand, I remember it.

356
00:29:17,122 --> 00:29:19,784
That was years ago.

357
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:21,519
What's done, is done.

358
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,687
Why are you here now?

359
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:27,960
You know I can't save Stephen.

360
00:29:28,032 --> 00:29:30,592
Some people in the
town talk of ending it.

361
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,068
Stephen was the most
outspoken of them all.

362
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:36,130
But I understand that you share
his feelings. I do as well.

363
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:40,439
Not to offer sacrifice would
mean the death of us all.

364
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:42,377
We're already dead!

365
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:46,247
We're the living dead who each
year live in fear of being chosen.

366
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:48,148
Who can't leave this cursed town,

367
00:29:48,219 --> 00:29:50,710
who don't age, don't marry,
don't have young.

368
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,416
Who calls this a life?

369
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,223
Please. I understand your
concerns, but there was a pact.

370
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,458
It is not easy to change that.

371
00:30:00,532 --> 00:30:05,936
The people will follow you.
They trust you.

372
00:30:06,004 --> 00:30:08,905
Look at me. Just by being here
I am opposing my own father.

373
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:13,307
You must speak to him.

374
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:16,404
If not for us, then
for the travelers.

375
00:30:16,481 --> 00:30:20,212
I fear my father
has ill intentions.

376
00:30:20,285 --> 00:30:23,083
Please, Franklin.
You must talk to him.

377
00:30:37,435 --> 00:30:42,395
If they've crossed the boundary,
there's no following them.

378
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:48,275
What in God's name...
The doors are open.

379
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:01,786
It'll come for us all.

380
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,852
We must head back
and warn the others.

381
00:31:12,637 --> 00:31:14,571
Ah! Ah! Ah!

382
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,999
Sir Henry?

383
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,737
How can I help you, Franklin?

384
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,807
I've come to talk
about these travelers.

385
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:01,541
What about them?

386
00:32:01,619 --> 00:32:04,144
May I ask, what
are your intentions?

387
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,457
My intentions?

388
00:32:09,527 --> 00:32:11,188
Why are you holding them?

389
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:14,959
Well, because they have seen too much.

390
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:17,866
What are you going to do
with them? Sacrifice them?

391
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:21,372
If such a possibility exists.

392
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,532
The outsiders have
not made this bargain.

393
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,771
It's wrong to punish them with
a curse we brought on ourselves.

394
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:27,936
It's murder.

395
00:32:28,012 --> 00:32:29,343
How dare you?

396
00:32:29,414 --> 00:32:30,779
So it is your intention.

397
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:33,840
My intention is, as always,

398
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,910
to do all that is necessary
to protect this town.

399
00:32:36,988 --> 00:32:40,116
Should I do this thing,
then Stephen Chandler,

400
00:32:40,191 --> 00:32:42,853
will have the opportunity
to live another two years,

401
00:32:42,927 --> 00:32:44,918
perhaps even four if
we find the others.

402
00:32:44,996 --> 00:32:47,794
How can you argue with that?

403
00:32:47,865 --> 00:32:50,129
Are you telling me
the ceremony is rigged?

404
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:53,193
That the chosen one can be
changed at will? Your will?

405
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:55,967
The audacity you have to
question me on these matters.

406
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,701
I am this town's magistrate...

407
00:32:57,775 --> 00:32:59,242
Don't throw that title at me!

408
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,971
I was there.

409
00:33:01,045 --> 00:33:02,444
But it was given to me!

410
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:03,912
It was taken!

411
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:07,942
Get out.

412
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:10,487
A magi wanted to be magistrate.

413
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,581
Then suddenly a mysterious
plague befalls our town,

414
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:17,059
forcing our hand to anoint the only
one who has the power to stop it.

415
00:33:17,128 --> 00:33:22,156
That is enough! Be
careful, Franklin!

416
00:33:22,233 --> 00:33:24,133
Or what?

417
00:33:24,202 --> 00:33:26,136
You'll choose me next?

418
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:33,372
You walk a very
dangerous line, my friend.

419
00:33:33,444 --> 00:33:37,904
There is a growing number of
us who feel this should end.

420
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:40,382
We should stand up to
the ogre once and for all.

421
00:33:40,451 --> 00:33:42,681
Kill the ogre and stop
making the sacrifice?

422
00:33:42,754 --> 00:33:44,619
It's the ridiculous dream of a child.

423
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,157
Every year one of us is eaten.
That is a nightmare.

424
00:33:47,225 --> 00:33:49,750
That is why I was made magistrate.

425
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:52,819
I knew none of you would have
the will to do what is necessary.

426
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,559
And what's that?
We sacrifice for your eternal life?

427
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:57,157
We are all in
this together.

428
00:33:57,235 --> 00:34:03,435
Lest you forget, we don't
grow in number. I too will die.

429
00:34:07,078 --> 00:34:10,343
Who will be the one to
chain you to the stockade?

430
00:34:21,692 --> 00:34:23,853
## Swing low ##

431
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,761
## Sweet, sweet ogre ##

432
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:30,995
# Coming for
To carry me home #

433
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:32,536
Mike!
Shut up!

434
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,662
# What, Jessica? #

435
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,503
Don't you think maybe
we should do something?

436
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:39,338
I'm open to suggestions, sister.

437
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,605
Terry and Leah
are still out there.

438
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:43,306
They're in a better
position than we are.

439
00:34:43,381 --> 00:34:47,442
I'm serious. Mike,
what about the...

440
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:50,950
you know...

441
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:53,456
Le ogre?
You serious?

442
00:34:53,524 --> 00:34:55,685
You believe this guy?
He's a nut case!

443
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:58,695
Everybody in this town
is out of their freaking mind.

444
00:35:11,342 --> 00:35:13,572
You shouldn't
have come here.

445
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:18,741
How could I not? I am regretful
for the actions of this town.

446
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:22,809
Indeed, as we are. Please doth
grant us swift exit from here

447
00:35:22,887 --> 00:35:26,288
and we promiseth never
to returneth... again-eth.

448
00:35:26,357 --> 00:35:29,622
He seems to be a jester of sorts.

449
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,822
I find him quite amusing
considering the dire circumstances.

450
00:35:32,897 --> 00:35:35,593
It's Sir Henry's intention
to let young Stephen go

451
00:35:35,666 --> 00:35:37,657
and offer up you as
the sacrifice instead.

452
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:39,327
Hope, we can't let that happen.

453
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:41,564
I'd listen to young
Stephen on this one.

454
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:46,906
I have learned things today.
An awful truth, my father...

455
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:48,878
What is it?

456
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:52,006
Know that even Franklin is
growing more brave by the minute.

457
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,778
Has he spoken to your father?

458
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:57,014
Yes. There is
no convincing him.

459
00:35:57,088 --> 00:36:01,957
Hang on, is your
father Henry Bartlett?

460
00:36:02,026 --> 00:36:05,291
Stick dude?
My condolences.

461
00:36:11,669 --> 00:36:12,829
What the hell was that?

462
00:36:14,805 --> 00:36:16,363
I must go.

463
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:05,544
Father!

464
00:37:05,623 --> 00:37:06,988
Looking for something?

465
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,357
No. Well, yes.
A book.

466
00:37:10,428 --> 00:37:12,896
Something I could help you with?

467
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:17,424
A book of stories,
from when I was small.

468
00:37:17,501 --> 00:37:19,366
You're no longer
a child, my dear.

469
00:37:19,437 --> 00:37:23,601
What possible curiosity could
such a book hold for you now?

470
00:37:23,674 --> 00:37:26,040
It used to comfort me at
night when I was scared.

471
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:27,771
I want to give
it to young Stephen

472
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:29,676
to comfort him as
he awaits his end.

473
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:35,549
And what if young Stephen were
not to be chosen this year?

474
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:39,420
Or next, isn't that
what you mean?

475
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,288
There are two travelers
in the cell with Stephen.

476
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,760
I thought this would make you happy.

477
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,126
So you did this for me?

478
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:49,564
To make me happy?
Father, I am not happy!

479
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:52,398
None of us are! We don't know
what happiness is anymore!

480
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:56,429
Use your powers and put an end
to this. That'd make me happy.

481
00:37:56,507 --> 00:37:57,701
I cannot do that.

482
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,403
Have you even tried?

483
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:05,575
Hope, even if I could reverse
such dark magic, I wouldn't do it.

484
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,175
Not if it meant I had to
sit by and watch my daughter

485
00:38:08,252 --> 00:38:10,243
waste away to nothing.
I won't do that.

486
00:38:10,321 --> 00:38:14,155
But these travelers were
not part of that pact.

487
00:38:14,225 --> 00:38:17,888
So you would prefer this
happen to young Stephen?

488
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:19,589
I'd rather it be no one!

489
00:38:19,664 --> 00:38:21,063
It is not possible!

490
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:26,692
If the ogre does not accept
the intended sacrifice,

491
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:29,672
he will exact his revenge
over the entire town,

492
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:33,267
a wrath only imaginable in
the very depths of hell itself!

493
00:38:33,344 --> 00:38:36,472
I cannot and will not
preside over such an event!

494
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:41,075
How is one death
different from any other?

495
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:52,792
The men never returned.
I fear the worst.

496
00:38:52,863 --> 00:38:55,423
What if the lair
has been disturbed?

497
00:38:55,499 --> 00:38:57,490
We must send another search party.

498
00:38:57,568 --> 00:38:59,798
No, it's too late for that.

499
00:38:59,870 --> 00:39:02,361
Their fates have
already been sealed.

500
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,637
But, if the beast has eaten...

501
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:07,974
perhaps we need not
sacrifice tonight.

502
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,479
It's the very act of sacrifice,

503
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:12,982
of being chosen and
submitting to the beast itself

504
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,018
that fulfills our end of the bargain.

505
00:39:15,086 --> 00:39:17,782
These travelers
have not been chosen.

506
00:39:17,855 --> 00:39:21,757
But still, if the lair
has been disturbed,

507
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:24,021
we'll have to make a
sacrifice right away

508
00:39:24,095 --> 00:39:26,791
to keep it from coming after us all.

509
00:39:26,864 --> 00:39:31,062
Do you see?
Do you see now?

510
00:39:31,135 --> 00:39:35,538
These travelers have brought
undue pain onto us all.

511
00:39:35,606 --> 00:39:39,474
Because of them, two
more of us are dead.

512
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:44,503
It would appear that the
decision has been made for us.

513
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,701
The plague, it is true.

514
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,846
I hope Terry and
Leah are smart enough

515
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:22,545
to realize that we need help.

516
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:25,521
Maybe they can get us out of this.

517
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:28,285
You know, I bet Terry is
hopping to it right now.

518
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:30,156
Mike, I'm serious.

519
00:40:30,227 --> 00:40:34,561
I'm just getting a little bit
scared here. it's not funny.

520
00:40:34,632 --> 00:40:37,157
No, it's not funny!
It's ridiculous.

521
00:40:37,234 --> 00:40:41,295
Stevie, this whole town of
yours, you are all freakin' nuts.

522
00:40:41,372 --> 00:40:47,004
You should do what normal
kids do and run away.

523
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:48,066
We can't.

524
00:40:48,145 --> 00:40:49,237
Why not?

525
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,304
I'd be so far gone right now.

526
00:40:51,382 --> 00:40:53,441
That's you.

527
00:40:53,517 --> 00:40:56,281
But we cannot leave this town.

528
00:40:56,353 --> 00:40:59,584
And therein lies the rub.

529
00:40:59,657 --> 00:41:04,219
Okay, Stevie, what happens
if you leave this town?

530
00:41:04,295 --> 00:41:06,229
Awful things.

531
00:41:12,436 --> 00:41:15,234
Night has fallen.

532
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,399
They will come for me soon.

533
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:21,104
Now I thought they
were coming for me.

534
00:41:21,178 --> 00:41:23,772
Ohhh!

535
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:26,282
Mike, what is it?!

536
00:41:41,966 --> 00:41:46,335
Shutter your windows!
Lock your doors!

537
00:41:46,403 --> 00:41:52,035
Shutter your windows!
Lock your doors!

538
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:57,172
Shutter your windows!
Lock your doors!

539
00:41:57,248 --> 00:42:03,551
Shutter your windows!
Lock your doors!

540
00:42:03,621 --> 00:42:08,558
Shutter your windows!
Lock your doors!

541
00:42:08,626 --> 00:42:13,928
Shutter your windows!
Lock your doors!

542
00:42:18,068 --> 00:42:20,536
Young Stephen.

543
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:24,040
The eyes of good fortune
look upon you this evening.

544
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:27,544
It is my time!
I am indeed the Chosen One.

545
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:30,136
Bring forth the boy.

546
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:33,177
Don't touch her.

547
00:42:33,250 --> 00:42:35,718
Get your hands off her... oh!

548
00:42:35,786 --> 00:42:40,314
Do not do this!
It is my turn! I am chosen!

549
00:42:40,391 --> 00:42:43,554
Please, you don't understand!

550
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:44,924
No, please,

551
00:42:44,995 --> 00:42:47,793
he didn't do anything!
I didn't do anything!

552
00:42:47,865 --> 00:42:49,890
My friends are still out there!

553
00:42:49,967 --> 00:42:53,334
They're calling the cops as we speak!

554
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,872
Your friends
are dead.

555
00:42:57,341 --> 00:42:59,275
Dead at the hands of the beast.

556
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,208
You don't know that!

557
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:05,339
You are all at the mercy of the
ogre now and he shows no mercy.

558
00:43:05,416 --> 00:43:06,405
Bring the boy!

559
00:43:06,483 --> 00:43:08,417
Mike!

560
00:43:08,485 --> 00:43:10,043
Jess, he's lying!
Jess!

561
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:11,519
Mike!

562
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:14,149
Mike!

563
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:16,590
Get back here! Move!

564
00:43:16,660 --> 00:43:18,560
Let go of me!
Let go!

565
00:43:18,629 --> 00:43:19,857
Mike!

566
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,990
Stop it!
That's enough!

567
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,092
Cut it out!
This isn't funny!

568
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:26,193
Stop it!

569
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:28,932
I am warning you!
Stop this!

570
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:30,303
Mike!

571
00:43:30,374 --> 00:43:34,174
Jess? It's okay!
Alright, it's cool.

572
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:35,871
You people are crazy.

573
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,438
All of you!
If anything happens to him...

574
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:42,781
Hope? Stay
inside now.

575
00:43:42,853 --> 00:43:45,947
Let me go!
Take this off now!

576
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,651
I'm warning you!
This has gone way too far!

577
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:53,060
Dude, let me go!
Let me go! Let me go!

578
00:43:58,902 --> 00:44:01,996
That's enough!
Get back here!

579
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:25,058
Hope?

580
00:44:27,297 --> 00:44:28,286
Hope!

581
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:31,234
You risk everything.

582
00:44:31,301 --> 00:44:33,565
Everything that
is worth risking.

583
00:44:33,637 --> 00:44:36,731
Oh, God, shut up.
Where's Mike?

584
00:44:36,807 --> 00:44:39,105
Let's go get him then, shall we?

585
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,821
Are you okay?

586
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:53,686
Yeah, I'm great, I'm great.

587
00:44:57,695 --> 00:44:59,492
We must hurry!

588
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:23,043
We must go.

589
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:24,314
This way.

590
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:33,219
Hope Bartlett!

591
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:49,237
Wait.

592
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:52,248
From here, you
must go on alone.

593
00:45:52,316 --> 00:45:53,476
You're coming with us.

594
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,812
If you go back,

595
00:45:54,885 --> 00:45:56,512
they're gonna feed
you both to the thing.

596
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,179
Maybe so,

597
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,847
but we cannot leave this place.

598
00:45:59,923 --> 00:46:03,120
We cannot cross
the boundary.

599
00:46:03,193 --> 00:46:06,185
If you weren't planning on
coming with us, then why...?

600
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:09,255
Because it's time.
You two aren't part of this.

601
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:12,860
We're a good people.
We've just lost our way.

602
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,806
Run! Run for your lives!

603
00:46:18,876 --> 00:46:20,707
He can't cross it!

604
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:00,808
Stephen!

605
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:02,476
Hope?!

606
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:11,754
Stephen, no!

607
00:47:18,268 --> 00:47:19,667
No!

608
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:28,300
Go! Get away from this place! Go!

609
00:47:56,440 --> 00:48:01,070
The bell hasn't rung.
All is not well.

610
00:48:07,918 --> 00:48:09,476
Sir Henry!

611
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,987
Sir Henry,
are you there?

612
00:48:18,128 --> 00:48:20,892
He's gone?
I don't understand.

613
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:32,501
There was no sacrifice?

614
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:35,409
How could that be?
Could he have escaped?

615
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:36,673
Not without help.

616
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:39,011
Franklin, maybe this was your doing.

617
00:48:39,082 --> 00:48:42,540
How could you suggest that?

618
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:45,281
We must assemble
the town immediately.

619
00:48:45,355 --> 00:48:46,788
The prison cell is empty.

620
00:48:46,857 --> 00:48:49,485
Treason! We must set
out and find them!

621
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,652
No! We must assemble. Now.

622
00:48:51,728 --> 00:48:54,094
Where's Sir Henry?
We can right this wrong.

623
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:56,029
All of you, fair to the town hall.

624
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:58,624
In Sir Henry's absence,
it is my word.

625
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:04,764
It is my word.

626
00:49:18,555 --> 00:49:19,783
Hope?

627
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:26,493
Hope!

628
00:49:31,835 --> 00:49:34,429
Okay, I'm sorry, I know,

629
00:49:34,504 --> 00:49:36,369
But did you see that?

630
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,534
The way he just... pft!

631
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:41,008
I know, Jess.

632
00:49:41,078 --> 00:49:43,603
Look, this is gonna turn out okay.

633
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,875
We're gonna make it
through, believe that.

634
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,280
Oh, yeah, okay,

635
00:49:47,351 --> 00:49:49,285
and what if what
that guy said was true

636
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,913
and Terry and Leah
really are dead?

637
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:53,354
I don't know, Jess.

638
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,482
We have to believe otherwise.

639
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,755
Oh my God!

640
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,440
Yes! Yes!
You see!

641
00:50:18,749 --> 00:50:20,341
I'm so happy!

642
00:50:23,353 --> 00:50:25,947
Okay.
We're okay.

643
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:28,321
What the hell are
we gonna tell people?

644
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,360
What?
The truth.

645
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,055
What truth?
The truth about an ogre?

646
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:35,098
A town lost in time,
that doesn't age?

647
00:50:35,165 --> 00:50:38,191
The imaginary line that
disintegrates people in seconds?

648
00:50:38,268 --> 00:50:39,963
Which one do you want to lead with?

649
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:44,133
We'll just have to
take them back there.

650
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:46,835
Never thought I'd say this,
but we need to find the cops.

651
00:50:46,910 --> 00:50:50,004
We explain everything and
then we take them there,

652
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,479
and then we'll prove it!

653
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,482
Uh-huh.

654
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,212
Look, there's our ride.

655
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,122
This is not gonna go well.

656
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:03,853
Hello!

657
00:51:06,963 --> 00:51:08,191
Where is Sir Henry?

658
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,096
And why was there no sacrifice?

659
00:51:10,167 --> 00:51:11,657
What do we do now?

660
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,566
The ogre will seek revenge on us all!

661
00:51:13,637 --> 00:51:16,936
Everyone, please!
We must remain calm.

662
00:51:17,007 --> 00:51:21,171
We must use our wits, and not
be driven by fear or anger!

663
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,941
Where is Sir Henry, Franklin?
What kind of trickery is this?

664
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:28,245
I don't know where the others are.

665
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:31,515
What I do know is the
pact has been broken.

666
00:51:31,588 --> 00:51:33,453
The ogre's wrath
may be set upon us.

667
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:37,718
There is still time!

668
00:51:37,794 --> 00:51:41,286
Henry Bartlett could not just have
disappeared, he wouldn't do that!

669
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:45,027
I already went to his home.
He was nowhere to be found.

670
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:49,198
Perhaps then Sir Henry has gone
to capture the outsiders himself!

671
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:52,070
Perhaps, but we must move
on without Sir Henry for now.

672
00:51:52,142 --> 00:51:53,268
Where's Hope?

673
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:54,901
And Stephen?

674
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,640
I don't know!

675
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:03,248
Do you know anything?!

676
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:05,413
Quiet, please!

677
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:09,425
Hope Bartlett!
Hope!

678
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:20,236
What are you doing out here, child?
I was worried sick.

679
00:52:20,303 --> 00:52:22,601
You used to teach me
the craft once, remember?

680
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,401
We have no time for that, Hope.

681
00:52:24,474 --> 00:52:28,103
I must offer up another
sacrifice before it is too late.

682
00:52:28,178 --> 00:52:30,476
If we must sacrifice,
then choose me.

683
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:36,114
No. You'd never do that.

684
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:37,813
Who shall it be this time?

685
00:52:37,888 --> 00:52:39,014
You don't understand.

686
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:43,992
Not Stephen.
He's already dead.

687
00:52:44,060 --> 00:52:49,430
The outsiders are gone. Who's next?
Franklin? Is he your biggest threat?

688
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:53,265
You watch your
tongue, young lady.

689
00:52:58,942 --> 00:53:04,812
Maybe you can waive your staff and cause
another plague, one worst then the last.

690
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:08,177
We can't wait!

691
00:53:08,251 --> 00:53:11,414
We must sacrifice now.
It is our only chance!

692
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:15,857
And who is to choose?
You, Giles?

693
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:19,987
Or are you volunteering
yourself for sacrifice?

694
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:22,293
If the travelers made
it past the border,

695
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:25,425
then we should find Stephen
Chandler, as first planned.

696
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:27,993
And what if he is never found?

697
00:53:28,071 --> 00:53:32,132
Enough!
This is pointless, people.

698
00:53:32,209 --> 00:53:34,700
This is a sign.

699
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:37,008
The travelers were not
a harbinger of doom.

700
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,014
We need to look upon
them as a beacon.

701
00:53:39,082 --> 00:53:42,051
An example that exposed
the ills of this town,

702
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,949
that have gone on for far too long.

703
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,716
Henry Bartlett lied
about the Chosen One.

704
00:53:46,790 --> 00:53:48,917
No!

705
00:53:48,992 --> 00:53:50,983
How much further
did his lies go?!

706
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,619
We must find him, then.

707
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:56,530
Accusations like this should
not be slung in his absence.

708
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:01,196
He is not here now.
Without him, it is my say.

709
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:07,435
I have found the book.

710
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:10,536
I have seen the spells!

711
00:54:10,614 --> 00:54:13,583
You are a monster!

712
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,582
Hope, it wasn't
supposed to be this way.

713
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:23,114
It was only supposed
to be one... Lord Albert.

714
00:54:23,193 --> 00:54:25,684
The town needed a new leader.

715
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:28,390
I knew what the town needed,
the town needed me.

716
00:54:30,967 --> 00:54:34,425
The spell couldn't be controlled
and it spread. I did all I could.

717
00:54:34,504 --> 00:54:36,096
You did what you wanted.

718
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,197
I gave you eternal life!

719
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:40,937
All you gave us was death.

720
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:46,748
Your gift, "This will protect
you from all that is evil."

721
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,750
Those were
your words, remember?

722
00:54:48,818 --> 00:54:50,786
Hope...

723
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:55,553
Father... you are evil.

724
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:03,232
Evil or not, this town
needs me now, more then ever.

725
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:05,564
What could you possibly do?!

726
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,762
What we should have
done years ago.

727
00:55:07,837 --> 00:55:11,739
Find a way to destroy the
beast without your help.

728
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,800
It can't be done!
Don't you understand!

729
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:17,574
That is the true
plague of Ellensford!

730
00:55:17,647 --> 00:55:21,515
Kill the beast or not, it doesn't
matter, you will all perish!

731
00:55:21,584 --> 00:55:25,884
I will rejoice the day.
We all will.

732
00:55:30,860 --> 00:55:32,350
Hope.

733
00:55:33,630 --> 00:55:35,655
Hope!

734
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:42,094
We need to take
arms against the beast.

735
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,936
Fight it once and for all.

736
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,533
That's like signing
our own death warrant!

737
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,373
Something is moving in the trees!

738
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,290
Hope!

739
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:07,626
Hope, you have given
us all a horrible scare!

740
00:56:09,733 --> 00:56:10,927
Where is your father?

741
00:56:11,000 --> 00:56:12,024
I do not know.

742
00:56:13,737 --> 00:56:15,967
We all must listen to Franklin now.

743
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,906
There will be no more sacrifices.

744
00:56:18,975 --> 00:56:21,842
If the ogre is to set his
wrath upon us, we must be ready.

745
00:56:21,911 --> 00:56:25,039
We can't defeat the ogre.

746
00:56:25,115 --> 00:56:29,449
I cannot stop the ogre, not yet.
But I can buy us some time.

747
00:56:29,519 --> 00:56:31,783
Hope, what are
you talking about?

748
00:56:36,659 --> 00:56:38,388
What is all this?

749
00:56:38,461 --> 00:56:40,929
Years ago, my father passed
on some of his craft to me.

750
00:56:40,997 --> 00:56:42,760
As a precaution should
this day ever come.

751
00:56:42,832 --> 00:56:45,596
Do you want to live
through this night?

752
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:48,831
Then listen to me.
Everyone grab one candle.

753
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,863
Take only as many as you
need to last the night.

754
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,867
Franklin and I will
come to your homes

755
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:20,800
and teach you the magic of the candles

756
00:57:20,870 --> 00:57:23,600
and how to use them against the ogre.

757
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:26,073
Henry Bartlett is alive, Lawrence.

758
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:29,873
His daughter and Franklin
are up to no good,

759
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:32,608
and it is up to us now
to restore the order.

760
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,809
What do you
suggest we do?

761
00:57:34,884 --> 00:57:37,648
We've got to find Sir Henry.

762
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:40,917
But the ogre? Going into
the woods now is suicide.

763
00:57:40,990 --> 00:57:44,289
And to follow the plan of
some impetuous young girl.

764
00:57:44,360 --> 00:57:47,557
I say we find our leader.

765
00:57:48,765 --> 00:57:49,789
Done.

766
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:13,781
Ahhhhhhh!

767
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:51,318
Unclean beast.

768
00:59:12,982 --> 00:59:16,577
Really, thank you very much.

769
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:21,221
Are we really gonna do this?

770
00:59:21,291 --> 00:59:23,191
I don't know.

771
00:59:31,868 --> 00:59:36,567
Are you sure you got
that punch line right?

772
00:59:36,639 --> 00:59:38,800
Help you?

773
00:59:38,875 --> 00:59:41,139
Yeah, we were hiking in the woods!

774
00:59:41,210 --> 00:59:42,302
Our friends got hurt!

775
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:43,902
...happened to our friends.

776
00:59:43,980 --> 00:59:46,540
Whoa! Let's take this one at a time.

777
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:48,743
Why don't you both
sit down and slow down.

778
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,495
Our friends are lost.

779
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:02,531
This isn't gonna
be easy to explain...

780
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,657
Two of
our friends...

781
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,132
We were hiking...

782
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:08,136
Hang on, you're gonna
give me whiplash. You. Go.

783
01:00:08,204 --> 01:00:13,642
We were on a hiking trip with two
of our friends, Terry and Leah.

784
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:16,838
Terry hurt, and he probably
ended up breaking his ankle.

785
01:00:16,913 --> 01:00:18,676
So we left him to get some help...

786
01:00:18,748 --> 01:00:20,215
Left him, huh?

787
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:22,444
No, we didn't "leave" like abandon.

788
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:24,213
They were okay when we left them.

789
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:25,151
"Were" okay?

790
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:26,153
Are okay.

791
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,211
"Were" or "are"?

792
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:28,655
Are!

793
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,888
You're not from
around here, are ya?

794
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,295
No, we're from...

795
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:38,061
Listen bro, this
is important...

796
01:00:38,134 --> 01:00:39,294
Sheriff!

797
01:00:44,040 --> 01:00:46,565
I'm sorry. Sheriff.

798
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,203
Know that town
out in the woods?

799
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:51,371
Like an Amish village?

800
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,682
Ellensford.

801
01:00:58,755 --> 01:01:01,918
You hear that, Anderson?

802
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:05,085
They're looking for "Ellensford".

803
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:08,597
We're not looking for
Ellensford, we were there.

804
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:14,001
Son, I've lived here all my life. There's
no town out there. That's an urban myth.

805
01:01:14,070 --> 01:01:16,698
We're not crazy!
We were there!

806
01:01:16,773 --> 01:01:19,708
They kidnapped us and
locked us in a jail cell!

807
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:22,745
Kidnapped, huh?

808
01:01:26,549 --> 01:01:28,414
Do you know what an ogre is?

809
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:33,188
Ogre? What the hell
are you talking about?

810
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:36,521
An ogre, okay? A beast, lives
in the woods, eats people?

811
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:42,856
Sure I know what an ogre is.

812
01:01:45,168 --> 01:01:47,966
Anderson, you know what
an ogre is, don't you?

813
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:50,938
Yeah, sure do.

814
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,641
Name's Patty.
Been married 12 years.

815
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,305
We're raising a little ogre too.

816
01:02:05,621 --> 01:02:09,079
I am not joking
around, this is serious!

817
01:02:09,158 --> 01:02:11,888
Are you guys gonna
help us? We need help!

818
01:02:16,165 --> 01:02:18,656
Sure we'll help ya.

819
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:20,794
I'm gonna go get the paperwork,

820
01:02:20,870 --> 01:02:25,204
we'll take your statement, then
we'll see about finding your friends.

821
01:02:25,274 --> 01:02:26,832
Okay, please hurry.

822
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,740
It'll just be a moment.

823
01:02:30,313 --> 01:02:32,281
You two go sit over there.

824
01:03:11,554 --> 01:03:13,988
Mike, no, no way.

825
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:15,717
They don't believe a word of it.

826
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:16,781
Would you?

827
01:03:16,859 --> 01:03:19,350
No. No turning back now.

828
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,261
Anderson...

829
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:28,325
I got to go, bye!

830
01:03:28,404 --> 01:03:29,803
Where'd they go?

831
01:03:32,074 --> 01:03:34,599
Sheriff, I just turned away...

832
01:03:39,282 --> 01:03:40,977
Son of a...

833
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,321
Sir Henry?
Sir Henry!

834
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,860
You hear something?

835
01:03:53,930 --> 01:03:54,954
No.

836
01:03:57,900 --> 01:03:59,731
Sir Henry?

837
01:04:01,270 --> 01:04:02,430
Sir Henry!

838
01:04:02,505 --> 01:04:04,234
Keep your voice down!

839
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:08,744
Why don't you set a table for the
ogre before you send him to dinner?

840
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:17,281
Giles, this is foolish.
We should go back.

841
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:20,516
And do what?
We must find Sir Henry.

842
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:24,788
What if something else has
already found Sir Henry?

843
01:04:29,165 --> 01:04:30,655
Wait.

844
01:04:38,507 --> 01:04:40,407
Giles!

845
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:16,336
We're stuck.

846
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:20,109
Yeah, no kidding. I told you
this thing couldn't go off road.

847
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:24,551
It's not a freakin' SUV.
Stop, stop!

848
01:05:24,620 --> 01:05:26,520
Let me get out and check it.

849
01:05:31,627 --> 01:05:32,616
Okay, go.

850
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:41,102
Mike!
Stop!

851
01:05:42,305 --> 01:05:43,966
Mike!

852
01:05:48,678 --> 01:05:50,669
Feel better now?

853
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:07,259
Well, they're gonna come looking for it.
We wanted them out here anyways.

854
01:06:07,330 --> 01:06:11,357
Yeah, but without the grand theft
auto charges would have been nice.

855
01:06:11,434 --> 01:06:12,458
It's cute.

856
01:06:16,806 --> 01:06:18,205
There we go.

857
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:22,040
Whoa, okay, do you know
how to work that thing?

858
01:06:24,914 --> 01:06:25,903
No.

859
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,811
Okay, that's scary.

860
01:06:29,885 --> 01:06:31,546
More shells.

861
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:38,621
You know, if we go back in
there, we may not come out.

862
01:06:38,694 --> 01:06:40,594
Yeah, I know,

863
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,324
but, we have to try.

864
01:06:42,398 --> 01:06:44,764
I told Leah and Terry
I was coming back for them.

865
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:49,066
Just making sure we're
working with all our faculties.

866
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:51,800
After everything I've
seen in these woods so far,

867
01:06:51,874 --> 01:06:54,240
I'm winging it.
At best.

868
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:56,005
Okay.

869
01:07:04,687 --> 01:07:07,588
Pour a circle of salt
around your house.

870
01:07:10,826 --> 01:07:13,852
The circle will act as
protection against the ogre.

871
01:07:13,929 --> 01:07:16,796
This is our barrier, keeps
us from leaving this town.

872
01:07:24,907 --> 01:07:29,901
Once your candle is lit, you
must keep the candle burning.

873
01:07:29,979 --> 01:07:33,039
Now repeat these
words with us.

874
01:07:33,115 --> 01:07:36,846
Within this circle, all
things material and human,

875
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:38,853
shall be safe and untouched

876
01:07:38,921 --> 01:07:40,718
from the evil within the forest

877
01:07:40,790 --> 01:07:43,315
until the flame burns no more.

878
01:07:43,392 --> 01:07:47,385
Within this circle, all
things material and human,

879
01:07:47,463 --> 01:07:49,590
shall be safe
and untouched

880
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:54,432
from the evil within the forest
until the flame burns no more.

881
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:59,463
Don't worry, Mother. We will be
safe now until Father returns.

882
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:01,442
Your father would be proud.

883
01:08:05,581 --> 01:08:09,073
Don't worry, he'll return.
I'm sure he's all right.

884
01:08:09,151 --> 01:08:12,314
My father is dead.

885
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,352
Dead?

886
01:08:15,424 --> 01:08:17,551
It will be okay, Franklin.

887
01:08:17,626 --> 01:08:20,789
One way or another this
shall all come to an end.

888
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:23,627
It is time for all of us
to face our destiny.

889
01:08:30,005 --> 01:08:31,905
Heaven help us.

890
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:38,169
Maybe Father has
already slain the ogre,

891
01:08:38,247 --> 01:08:40,181
on his way home with the good news.

892
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:44,117
Yes, I should pray so.

893
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,032
Here we are.

894
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,353
Oh, my God.

895
01:09:30,499 --> 01:09:31,693
Jess!

896
01:09:36,105 --> 01:09:37,402
What?

897
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,301
It's Terry.

898
01:09:43,712 --> 01:09:45,202
Oh my God.

899
01:09:54,523 --> 01:09:56,684
Mike? Where are you going?

900
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,283
I'm going back to that town!

901
01:09:58,360 --> 01:10:03,263
You can't.
It killed Leah and Terry.

902
01:10:03,332 --> 01:10:05,323
And that thing killed them!

903
01:10:08,837 --> 01:10:11,305
That guy Stephen saved your life.

904
01:10:11,373 --> 01:10:14,240
And Hope saved mine.
So I'm going back there.

905
01:10:14,310 --> 01:10:17,302
If there's a way to kill
this thing, I'm gonna find it.

906
01:10:17,379 --> 01:10:18,437
No! Mike!

907
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:06,244
Oh. A nail of the beast.

908
01:12:16,965 --> 01:12:21,163
Shh, child.
The spell will work.

909
01:12:23,505 --> 01:12:26,474
See? Better now.

910
01:12:46,562 --> 01:12:49,588
It's alright.
I have it now.

911
01:13:55,397 --> 01:13:58,332
We've been walking for hours.

912
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,699
What if we can't
find that place again.

913
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,398
The sheriff didn't
even know it existed.

914
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:08,432
That sheriff doesn't know his own
stench exists, never mind this place.

915
01:14:08,510 --> 01:14:10,068
We're close, okay?

916
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:15,173
Okay, but what if we're walking
in circles this whole time?

917
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:16,274
Mike...

918
01:14:16,351 --> 01:14:17,784
Jess!
Enough!

919
01:14:21,056 --> 01:14:22,353
I'm sorry.

920
01:14:24,293 --> 01:14:25,317
We're close.

921
01:14:27,062 --> 01:14:28,893
How are we even
going back again?

922
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:29,953
Shh.

923
01:14:35,003 --> 01:14:37,062
Go.

924
01:14:38,207 --> 01:14:39,196
Mike!

925
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,753
I think we're back.

926
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:20,343
Everyone, quiet.
Please.

927
01:15:21,850 --> 01:15:23,715
Give the travelers
a chance to speak.

928
01:15:30,559 --> 01:15:32,584
Alright,

929
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:35,425
we encountered your
ogre and we lived.

930
01:15:35,497 --> 01:15:38,694
Shots from my gun chased
it clean through the woods.

931
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,359
If it ran, it means it was hurt.

932
01:15:40,435 --> 01:15:43,029
If it was hurt, it can be killed.

933
01:15:47,576 --> 01:15:49,476
Bullets won't kill the ogre.

934
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:52,537
We need more than
your gun to destroy it.

935
01:15:52,614 --> 01:15:55,378
We need more candles,
more powder from hope.

936
01:15:55,450 --> 01:15:58,419
It is the only reason that the beast
did not take more of us last night.

937
01:15:58,487 --> 01:16:01,479
No. William is right.
We need more than a gun.

938
01:16:01,557 --> 01:16:04,583
There is a chance I can undo my
father's spell but it's gonna take time.

939
01:16:04,660 --> 01:16:06,685
If there was a way to kill the ogre,

940
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:08,457
why haven't we tried it before?

941
01:16:08,530 --> 01:16:10,327
Where was our will before?

942
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:13,891
My father had
us living in fear.

943
01:16:16,238 --> 01:16:19,571
Now we have to be brave.
This is our only chance.

944
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:21,575
The ogre will need to be distracted.

945
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:24,578
Distract the ogre?
How do you plan on doing that?

946
01:16:26,114 --> 01:16:27,103
With bait.

947
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:29,810
And just what?

948
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:33,286
Or dare I say who is
going to be that bait?

949
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:38,793
Me.

950
01:16:44,766 --> 01:16:46,597
The traveler is right.

951
01:16:46,668 --> 01:16:49,694
They're the only ones that can
cross the line and come back.

952
01:16:49,771 --> 01:16:53,104
That is our
advantage. Alright.

953
01:16:53,175 --> 01:16:55,643
We need as many men as
we have weapons.

954
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:58,475
Where's Giles?
Where's the keeper of arms?

955
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:24,004
Matthew, where's your father?

956
01:17:25,607 --> 01:17:27,837
Where is Giles, my boy?!

957
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:31,003
This is not a time
for secrets!

958
01:17:31,079 --> 01:17:33,639
He and Lawrence took
arms from the supply

959
01:17:33,715 --> 01:17:37,242
and went into the woods
to find Sir Henry.

960
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,048
He's not returned?

961
01:17:44,126 --> 01:17:47,323
You must be strong.
Like your father.

962
01:18:01,677 --> 01:18:05,078
How many more sons, daughters,
loved ones must be sacrificed?

963
01:18:05,147 --> 01:18:08,310
How many lives have we all
lived confined by this curse?

964
01:18:09,685 --> 01:18:12,119
The time has come to face our fear.

965
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:16,021
Defeat the ogre,
no matter the consequence.

966
01:18:21,496 --> 01:18:23,191
I need men.

967
01:18:50,158 --> 01:18:52,285
Good.

968
01:18:52,360 --> 01:18:55,488
The rest of you will take
refuge here in the town hall.

969
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:59,466
You'll only be safe by combining
what candles we have left.

970
01:18:59,534 --> 01:19:03,527
Matthew, will there be any
remaining arms in the keep?

971
01:19:03,605 --> 01:19:06,130
There was not many to begin with.

972
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:09,302
Then we will make with our
hands what else we need.

973
01:19:13,782 --> 01:19:15,750
Not what you'd call an arsenal.

974
01:19:15,817 --> 01:19:16,977
We'll have to do.

975
01:19:17,052 --> 01:19:18,246
Do they work?

976
01:19:18,320 --> 01:19:20,185
Giles polished them everyday.

977
01:19:20,255 --> 01:19:22,348
He kept them in prime condition.

978
01:19:22,424 --> 01:19:25,257
Rock and roll.

979
01:19:33,235 --> 01:19:34,998
These are too small.

980
01:19:45,614 --> 01:19:47,912
How about this one?

981
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:48,972
That's the one.

982
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:50,415
Yes.

983
01:23:11,486 --> 01:23:13,818
I'm back!
Come get me!

984
01:23:37,846 --> 01:23:39,939
Come and eat me, you beast!

985
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:15,846
No turning back.

986
01:24:27,629 --> 01:24:29,187
Hold.

987
01:25:18,546 --> 01:25:19,774
Get him!

988
01:25:24,886 --> 01:25:26,148
Now!

989
01:26:07,195 --> 01:26:08,560
Hope! Now!

990
01:26:28,416 --> 01:26:29,974
Ahhh!

991
01:26:32,887 --> 01:26:34,149
Ahhh!

992
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,384
Hope!

993
01:26:57,145 --> 01:26:59,943
Ahhhh!

994
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:17,025
Hope needs more time!

995
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:18,861
We don't have more time!

996
01:27:20,969 --> 01:27:23,631
Jess, run for the line, now!

997
01:27:26,241 --> 01:27:27,708
Meet us at the line!

998
01:27:48,696 --> 01:27:51,290
Come on, Jess, keep going!

999
01:27:51,366 --> 01:27:52,390
Come on, run!

1000
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:57,801
Come get us now.

1001
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,114
Hit him.

1002
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:22,994
Hope! Let's go!

1003
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:43,106
Hope!

1004
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:15,040
Hope!

1005
01:30:25,920 --> 01:30:29,981
The spell... it's broken.

1006
01:30:35,963 --> 01:30:38,989
Then... it is over.

1007
01:31:18,072 --> 01:31:19,300
Hope?

1008
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:24,067
It's time to go.

1009
01:31:24,145 --> 01:31:27,308
What the hell are you talking about?
What's going on?

1010
01:31:27,381 --> 01:31:30,817
It's okay.
Don't worry.

1011
01:31:30,885 --> 01:31:34,048
What just
happened to them?

1012
01:31:35,890 --> 01:31:39,257
The spell is broken.
We're free.

1013
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,420
We killed that thing.
It's done.

1014
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:45,364
It's okay.
Our time came long ago.

1015
01:31:45,433 --> 01:31:49,199
This is the only way.
Thank you.

1016
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:53,229
Without you, we may never
have found the strength.

1017
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:00,212
Hope, this...
