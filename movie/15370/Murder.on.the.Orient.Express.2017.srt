1
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:50,916
MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS

2
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:15,832
Grademuren, Jerusalem

3
00:01:49,584 --> 00:01:52,792
He said exactly four minutes.

4
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,792
Hurry up.

5
00:02:22,292 --> 00:02:25,040
Two perfect eggs this time, right?

6
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:45,792
Maybe.

7
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:53,832
It's the hen's fault. Why do the
hens make eggs of different sizes?

8
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,916
<i>Mon ami.
Oeufs.</i>

9
00:02:57,084 --> 00:03:02,876
I have three religions that are a revolt
close. Can they deliver a miracle?

10
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:07,708
<i>Allons-y!</i>

11
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,500
Poirot!

12
00:03:19,668 --> 00:03:22,040
Pardon...

13
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:28,708
It is not...

14
00:03:28,876 --> 00:03:32,292
There is the imbalance in...

15
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,376
Yes.
- That was better.

16
00:03:42,624 --> 00:03:45,040
Pardon. Make room

17
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,960
Called the accused.

18
00:03:49,124 --> 00:03:51,376
The rabbi.

19
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,708
Priest.

20
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:56,168
And the imam

21
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:00,500
It's like in a joke, right?

22
00:04:00,668 --> 00:04:02,876
The Rabbit, the Priest and the Imam.

23
00:04:04,124 --> 00:04:07,876
<i>Mais non.
Forgive me. I am Belgium.</i>

24
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,708
Let's begin.

25
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,500
In the grave church above us -

26
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:17,500
<i>- Meet the three representatives
under management -</i>

27
00:04:17,668 --> 00:04:22,540
<i>- by the criminal commissioner to agree
on a scheme for use of the market.</i>

28
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,500
<i>An hour after this tense encounter,
an invaluable relic is stolen.</i>

29
00:04:29,584 --> 00:04:35,416
It is said that one of
these three men is behind.

30
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:39,460
The police have no evidence found.

31
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:42,332
I have found one.

32
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:47,332
<i>In an extremely well-preserved fresco room -</i>

33
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:52,376
<i>- is a single crack caused
by clumsy climbing -</i>

34
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:57,124
<i>- wearing shoes with hard
soles or maybe boots.</i>

35
00:05:02,168 --> 00:05:07,960
So, ladies and gentlemen, we
must ask who benefits from this.

36
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,876
Our three holy men live humble lives.

37
00:05:13,832 --> 00:05:16,460
They have shoes with thin soles.

38
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:21,960
Suddenly wealth and jewels would wake up -

39
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:25,084
- too much suspicion
They do not take advantage of it.

40
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:30,416
We must now set up an armed guard
at the southern gate. Thanks.

41
00:05:30,584 --> 00:05:36,876
The only one who takes advantage of
the theft and unrest that it causes,

42
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,708
- is a man whose office I was
allowed to search this morning,

43
00:05:40,876 --> 00:05:43,960
- while I was waiting for my
breakfast with some disappointment.

44
00:05:44,124 --> 00:05:46,500
Trouble with the eggs.
Nothing you need to know.

45
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:50,124
A man who receives a sumptuous salary
to maintain order in Jerusalem.

46
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:54,416
Of course I am talking about
the criminal commissioner.

47
00:05:54,876 --> 00:05:57,332
A man who does not want
to lose his position, -

48
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:01,916
- when there is turmoil between
the people in the autonomy area,

49
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:06,792
- who wears boots and
which, I think, now regrets

50
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,916
- that he asked me to help with the case.

51
00:06:10,084 --> 00:06:13,292
Where do you dare to accuse me?
- Sir. sergeant.

52
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:17,500
Did you search the office?
- Yes.

53
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:22,500
And did you find what I anticipated?
- Yes. Exactly as you predicted.

54
00:06:46,124 --> 00:06:48,416
Stop!

55
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,876
It will be delivered tomorrow morning, Captain.
- Javel.

56
00:07:09,832 --> 00:07:12,248
The baggage is on board.

57
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:15,832
I won the right to
follow you to the ship.

58
00:07:17,748 --> 00:07:22,460
Then you go to Istanbul?
And then straight to London?

59
00:07:23,292 --> 00:07:28,208
I'm tired and deserved a little vacation.

60
00:07:28,376 --> 00:07:32,376
I would like to look at paintings
and have too much time.

61
00:07:33,876 --> 00:07:38,248
They are staring. Does it sound?
- It's just...

62
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,248
How did you know that it was him
from a small crack in the wall?

63
00:07:42,416 --> 00:07:44,916
I have an advantage.

64
00:07:45,084 --> 00:07:47,960
I can only see the
world as it should be.

65
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,960
And when it is not, it
fails to be perfected -

66
00:07:51,168 --> 00:07:55,460
- like a nose in a face

67
00:07:56,292 --> 00:07:58,792
It makes the most of life unbearable.

68
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:03,376
But it is useful when
crimes must be clarified.

69
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:08,124
It is as if you can look into their
hearts and indicate their true nature.

70
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:13,668
And whatever people say,
right and wrong are found.

71
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:16,500
There is nothing in between.

72
00:08:18,376 --> 00:08:21,540
Our roads are separated here.
- No, I'll follow them to the ferry.

73
00:08:22,292 --> 00:08:25,460
<i>Au revoir, mon capitaine.
We never meet again.</i>

74
00:08:25,624 --> 00:08:27,584
And do you want to fix your tie?

75
00:08:27,748 --> 00:08:29,540
Yes.
- Perfect.

76
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,748
Last call!

77
00:08:36,084 --> 00:08:38,124
Pardon.

78
00:08:39,248 --> 00:08:43,960
We are working on it. Soon it will be done.
- Yes, but will it be settled on time?

79
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:48,668
I will travel from Istanbul
tomorrow at 19 o'clock.

80
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:52,292
A very ill patient
awaits me in London.

81
00:08:53,792 --> 00:08:56,208
I am a doctor.

82
00:08:56,832 --> 00:08:58,708
Doctor.

83
00:08:58,876 --> 00:09:01,500
I am a doctor.

84
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:07,084
I yell in English, and now I'm
doing it higher and slower.

85
00:09:07,248 --> 00:09:10,084
Forgive me.

86
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:13,040
Allow me to help.

87
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:16,708
I recognize their mustache.

88
00:09:16,876 --> 00:09:21,124
From the newspaper. They are
detective Hercules Poirot, right?

89
00:09:21,624 --> 00:09:26,124
Hercule Poirot.
I do not kill lions. Mademoiselle.

90
00:09:28,248 --> 00:09:31,500
Mary Debenham, monsieur.
I forget names but never faces.

91
00:09:31,668 --> 00:09:35,124
Not yours at least.
- Are you from Baghdad?

92
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:41,460
It is true. They notice each detail.
Your ticket.

93
00:09:43,748 --> 00:09:47,416
I could ask if you enjoyed the
time as a governor there?

94
00:09:48,084 --> 00:09:51,168
The crotch on your sleeve
and the geography book.

95
00:09:51,332 --> 00:09:55,832
Governor or Cartographer.
I threw the dice.

96
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:01,916
I always whip them through geography
until they can all around the world.

97
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:06,584
Perhaps they get lost in life, but
they need to know where they are.

98
00:10:08,584 --> 00:10:12,668
Then the chains are thrown.
And right on time.

99
00:10:27,792 --> 00:10:30,416
I feel so free from here on the water.

100
00:10:30,584 --> 00:10:32,584
I wish I could enjoy it.

101
00:10:33,876 --> 00:10:36,500
We should be out of now, Mary.
- Not now.

102
00:10:37,584 --> 00:10:39,584
When it's over.

103
00:10:39,748 --> 00:10:43,708
When it's over.
Then no one can do anything to us.

104
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:17,000
<i>Here's my holiday.</i>

105
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:22,376
I can see the soul of the
city in these humble bread.

106
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:26,084
The world insists on the
destruction, but here -

107
00:11:26,208 --> 00:11:30,124
- There are masterpieces
ordered every day.

108
00:11:30,292 --> 00:11:33,540
Monsieur Poirot!
- Mohammed!

109
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:39,416
Mohammed, my friend,
you are an artist.

110
00:11:39,584 --> 00:11:42,960
My friend!
- Pardon.

111
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,876
Here. Came.

112
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,624
We're just looking for a
place for a private quarrel.

113
00:11:47,792 --> 00:11:51,960
It takes about 20 minutes
and then we agree. Or I do.

114
00:11:52,168 --> 00:11:56,084
Monsieur Bouc!
- Poirot! In the kitchen?

115
00:11:56,248 --> 00:12:00,832
Of course. He has an even better nose
for pastries than to catch jewel thief.

116
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:07,248
<i>Mon ami!
I can not save you when it goes wrong.</i>

117
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:11,624
This is my friend, the high-end Poirot,
whom I knew before the elevation.

118
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:13,832
This is...
- A cheerleader.

119
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,540
Yes. Bouc, you did not say
you had famous friends.

120
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:21,540
We are friends because I do not
ask for his cases. I do not care.

121
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:24,460
He does not call me to be bad.
- And you are.

122
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:28,792
Madame, Bouc, have a drink with me.
- But only an hour.

123
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,584
I'm taking the Orient Express at 19 o'clock.
I work as a conductor.

124
00:12:32,748 --> 00:12:35,792
My uncle pays me well to drive
with his beautiful train, -

125
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,376
- far away from him in the headquarters.

126
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:41,332
Sent out to enjoy good
food and wine forever.

127
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:44,876
Nepotism is an art form.
And you are its Michelangelo.

128
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
Mr. Poirot.
Are you also a girlfriend?

129
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:49,792
Certainly not.
- Generate this man you?

130
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,248
Soon. They are from the British Consulate.
- Yes.

131
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:56,416
It is about the Kassner case.
- Yes!

132
00:12:56,584 --> 00:13:00,376
Was I entitled in certain predictions?
- Specific.

133
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:04,876
I do not need to read the telegram.
- Fun. Is anyone unfaithful or dead?

134
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,460
Both parts unfortunately.

135
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:13,332
Someone has interrupted my longing for rest.

136
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:17,876
I have to travel with you, Bouc. Can you
find me a coupon at the Orient Express?

137
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:22,500
My friend, I'm not good at much, but
I can get you a bed on my train -

138
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:28,168
- in the middle of winter. Three
days free from cruelty and crime.

139
00:13:28,332 --> 00:13:30,960
Madame, I'm a pleasure. The gentleman.

140
00:13:31,624 --> 00:13:35,040
Your luggage has been picked up
and your bill has been paid.

141
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:41,792
You meet in Calais, they are taken to Dover
and then by train to London Victoria.

142
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:46,540
Allow me to thank you.
- Keep calm still. They make it worse.

143
00:13:53,748 --> 00:13:56,916
A little drink, buddy.
- Thanks. I did not carry your bags now.

144
00:13:57,084 --> 00:14:01,876
I have had a good week. We celebrate it
when happiness smiles and shares it.

145
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:04,124
Speak nicely about us Americans.

146
00:14:09,792 --> 00:14:12,084
No!
- Stop!

147
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:21,540
<i>Monsieur, bonsoir.
I'll take you to our best table.</i>

148
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:30,248
Our best table.
- No, I want it there.

149
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,460
Masterman. Do you have it all?

150
00:14:38,624 --> 00:14:42,624
Thank you for your interest, Mr. MacQueen.
I'm not wrong.

151
00:14:45,292 --> 00:14:48,960
My Goodness. It's Count Andrenyi.
Come come come.

152
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:53,748
I saw you dancing at Monte Christo.
May I take a picture of you?

153
00:15:03,124 --> 00:15:05,332
Pardon! Not my face.

154
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,292
Sorry.

155
00:15:39,709 --> 00:15:42,293
Simplon Orient Express, -

156
00:15:42,457 --> 00:15:46,085
- which stops in Sofia, Niš,
Belgrade, Vinkovci, Brod, -

157
00:15:46,249 --> 00:15:50,165
- and connected to Bucharest, Zagreb,
Trieste, Venice, Milan, Lausanne, -

158
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:55,333
- Dijon, Paris, Boulogne and Calais,
connected to London, depart in a quarter.

159
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:59,373
This way, Michel. Valuable load.
I need a first-class couch.

160
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:03,001
Make extra good for my friend.
He must be pampered like a panda in the zoo.

161
00:16:03,165 --> 00:16:07,209
But there is no room on board.
- Then make room. He can get number 11.

162
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:10,665
It is always ready for official use.
It is very comfortable.

163
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:13,125
The Austrian professor
has reserved it.

164
00:16:13,293 --> 00:16:16,793
Is not one first class cup available?
- No.

165
00:16:16,957 --> 00:16:19,001
Second class?
- Everything is busy.

166
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:22,917
Mademoiselle Debenham.
- Mr. Poirot, are you going to travel?

167
00:16:23,085 --> 00:16:26,585
It depends on the outcome of the discussion.
- Have all passengers arrived?

168
00:16:26,749 --> 00:16:29,293
All but mr. Harris.

169
00:16:29,457 --> 00:16:32,917
"All passengers must report half
an hour before departure, -

170
00:16:33,085 --> 00:16:37,373
- otherwise they can lose space. "
The half hour has passed.

171
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:41,585
Wear monsieur Poirot's luggage to Mr.
MacQueen in number three.

172
00:16:41,793 --> 00:16:43,833
<i>Merci, Bouc.
- Enjoy the journey.</i>

173
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:46,209
<i>Welcome.
- Merci.</i>

174
00:16:48,249 --> 00:16:50,873
Three is an accident.

175
00:16:54,417 --> 00:16:58,749
Pardon. It was not to spoil you.
"They could do it a little bit.

176
00:17:00,585 --> 00:17:04,665
On board trains you
always encounter others.

177
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:08,541
It is wonderful. But I'm looking
forward to coming home now.

178
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:11,585
Travel is good with spicy
food, mosques and men.

179
00:17:11,793 --> 00:17:15,125
In the end, you would like to sleep at home.

180
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:23,085
I have been accused of
chasing men abroad.

181
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:28,293
And I honestly can not deny it.
I like being alone.

182
00:17:28,457 --> 00:17:33,333
But a lady has certain needs that should
be covered if the funds are for it.

183
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:35,917
And please on a regular basis.

184
00:17:38,957 --> 00:17:43,585
My Goodness. There is fire in the kitchen.
- Goodbye, madame.

185
00:17:45,541 --> 00:17:48,125
<i>Good evening.
- Bonsoir.</i>

186
00:17:48,293 --> 00:17:51,457
<i>Bonsoir, bonsoir.</i>

187
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:53,165
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

188
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:56,665
<i>Excusez-moi.
- After them.</i>

189
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,957
<i>Merci, merci.</i>

190
00:17:59,793 --> 00:18:02,001
Ah, number three.

191
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:06,457
Are you Mr. MacQueen?
- They have found the wrong bunk.

192
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:12,209
Sorry, is there a problem?
- No not at all.

193
00:18:12,373 --> 00:18:18,333
The train is stuffy. We are shown...
what is the name now... "sloffer".

194
00:18:20,001 --> 00:18:24,041
Really?
- I'm just as disappointed with you. How weird

195
00:18:32,917 --> 00:18:34,501
Come on.

196
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,373
No.

197
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,333
No.

198
00:19:09,085 --> 00:19:11,041
This?

199
00:19:13,709 --> 00:19:16,125
Why is my luggage not unpacked?

200
00:19:18,085 --> 00:19:21,793
Five minutes to departure! Last call!

201
00:19:30,749 --> 00:19:32,541
Should you be brushed?

202
00:19:32,709 --> 00:19:35,457
Why does hell take it so long?

203
00:19:35,585 --> 00:19:38,585
When we drive, my bed will be ready.
- It is arranged.

204
00:19:38,793 --> 00:19:42,541
No. The bed is supposed to be ready.
And get my dictaphone.

205
00:19:42,709 --> 00:19:46,249
Dogs on the table.
I have never seen anything crooks.

206
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,001
Yes.
- Find MacQueen.

207
00:19:48,165 --> 00:19:52,165
He must take the receipts from
the Milan trade with. Do it.

208
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,585
Do it now.

209
00:19:58,749 --> 00:20:01,165
Did I not say "do it now"?
- Javel.

210
00:21:02,333 --> 00:21:04,585
"Beware, for otherwise..."

211
00:21:05,957 --> 00:21:08,373
Your coffee, mr. Ratchett.

212
00:21:11,085 --> 00:21:14,293
Who is behind this?
- I do not know.

213
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:29,293
Good evening, mrs. Hubbard.
Hello, mr. Masterman.

214
00:21:46,417 --> 00:21:48,541
Halløjsa.

215
00:21:49,749 --> 00:21:52,541
If your gaze stays there, I
have to charge that rent.

216
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:55,833
I would like to pay.

217
00:21:56,001 --> 00:21:58,373
Have a drink.

218
00:21:59,457 --> 00:22:01,417
Are you offended?

219
00:22:01,585 --> 00:22:03,873
Disappointed.

220
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:08,749
Some men have a good look.
All they have to do is -

221
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:12,209
- close the mouth and then they
can win any winnings home.

222
00:22:14,457 --> 00:22:17,585
But still he opens his mouth.

223
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:38,373
Are you okay, Mrs. Hubbard?
I know you have a strong intuition.

224
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:43,417
That's what my other husband said.

225
00:22:43,585 --> 00:22:47,665
No, wait. It was my first. Yes.

226
00:22:47,833 --> 00:22:49,585
A very clever man.

227
00:22:49,793 --> 00:22:52,917
A face like a calm, but
I loved it calmly.

228
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:56,749
Nice to talk to you.

229
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,709
Good night.

230
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:04,917
Good night.

231
00:23:21,585 --> 00:23:24,749
<i>Monsieur Poirot?
- Entrez, Pierre Michel.</i>

232
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:30,165
<i>Voilà.</i>

233
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:34,293
- I move the MacQueen into Bouc's coup.
They travel in first class.

234
00:23:35,793 --> 00:23:38,293
Unparalleled. Thanks.

235
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:42,333
<i>Bon appétit.
- And the eggs?</i>

236
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:06,833
Good afternoon. Mrs. Hubbard.

237
00:24:07,001 --> 00:24:09,085
Good afternoon.

238
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,165
Here you go.

239
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,793
Sincerely from the Orient Express.
Thank you, sir. Bouc.

240
00:24:14,957 --> 00:24:19,585
I put myself at your disposal.
- No thanks. I do not drink.

241
00:24:19,793 --> 00:24:22,085
Can not you tolerate it?

242
00:24:22,249 --> 00:24:25,041
I can not bear sin.

243
00:24:25,209 --> 00:24:28,457
And the load is where the
devil finds his fists.

244
00:24:28,585 --> 00:24:30,585
We should not talk more together.

245
00:24:32,373 --> 00:24:34,125
Good afternoon.

246
00:24:34,293 --> 00:24:38,833
Monsieur. How about an aperitif?

247
00:24:39,001 --> 00:24:42,833
Unfortunately, I have a deal with
the chief executive officer.

248
00:24:43,001 --> 00:24:48,585
He still had to go.
- Sorry. Madame Madame.

249
00:24:48,749 --> 00:24:51,125
Madame. Madame.

250
00:24:51,749 --> 00:24:54,457
Are you in place?

251
00:24:54,585 --> 00:24:57,333
<i>Merci.
- As promised.</i>

252
00:24:57,501 --> 00:25:01,333
And yet the best on board
the train is not food.

253
00:25:04,709 --> 00:25:09,165
There is something about a bunch of strangers, stuck
together for days without anything in common -

254
00:25:09,333 --> 00:25:13,585
- than the need to travel from one place
to another and never see each other again.

255
00:25:13,749 --> 00:25:18,085
Boredom plus anonymity plus
a constant, gentle cradle.

256
00:25:19,085 --> 00:25:21,749
With your hobbies, you'll
never get into anything.

257
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,293
Hopefully not.

258
00:25:24,457 --> 00:25:26,665
Order fish for me.

259
00:25:28,501 --> 00:25:33,501
Swap the sea bass with the
tuna, endivie with potato -

260
00:25:34,501 --> 00:25:36,917
<i>Zwei.</i>

261
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:40,833
<i>Garçon,
Can I ask for the same?</i>

262
00:25:43,249 --> 00:25:45,457
Princess Dragomiroff.

263
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,957
Should I marry a fortune,
it should be of the size.

264
00:25:50,125 --> 00:25:54,165
I brushed Dalia this morning.
- No. You tortured my dog cat.

265
00:25:54,333 --> 00:25:57,873
I asked you to brush her.
- Do you still enjoy reading Dickens?

266
00:25:58,041 --> 00:25:59,917
<i>Mon ami.</i>

267
00:26:00,085 --> 00:26:03,749
With your books and adventures,
you'll miss a lot of romance.

268
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:09,373
Romance carries the penalty in itself.
There was...

269
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:15,165
Once upon a time there was a.

270
00:26:26,749 --> 00:26:30,585
For the future, I would prefer not
to sit at table with that man.

271
00:26:30,749 --> 00:26:35,165
People should sit together with their own kind.
We are not the same kind.

272
00:26:36,293 --> 00:26:40,165
Not everyone is just absorbed by
the racial segregation, professor.

273
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:45,165
It is a respect for all breeds that
I prefer them to be separated.

274
00:26:45,333 --> 00:26:50,333
If we mixed your red wine with the
white, it would destroy both.

275
00:26:57,585 --> 00:26:59,585
I like a good rose.

276
00:27:43,085 --> 00:27:46,585
How do you cut? Can I get here?

277
00:27:47,873 --> 00:27:50,085
Dessert is pure pleasure, -

278
00:27:50,249 --> 00:27:54,209
- and I feel silly by
sitting alone with it.

279
00:27:54,373 --> 00:27:57,333
I'm doing the best alone.

280
00:27:57,501 --> 00:28:02,833
But against a small piece of your
fragilité you may want to sit here.

281
00:28:03,001 --> 00:28:06,417
It was a pleasure.
May we ask for a fork?

282
00:28:09,125 --> 00:28:12,209
<i>I would like to meet you.
- Merci.</i>

283
00:28:12,873 --> 00:28:18,873
Never before have I been so close
to a celebrity. No, that's a lie.

284
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:21,833
Once upon a time I drove
in a bus with Ty Cobb.

285
00:28:23,333 --> 00:28:25,417
Baseball Player. Detroit.

286
00:28:28,209 --> 00:28:31,209
Can I take some of it on top?

287
00:28:31,373 --> 00:28:34,457
They are a special starut.

288
00:28:34,585 --> 00:28:36,833
A strange, strange man.

289
00:28:37,001 --> 00:28:40,125
I have an age where I know
what I like and do not like.

290
00:28:40,293 --> 00:28:45,709
What I like, I enjoy.
What I do not like, I can not stand.

291
00:28:45,873 --> 00:28:51,209
For example, snapshot before what turns
out to be a business conversation.

292
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:54,457
They are fun.

293
00:28:54,585 --> 00:28:56,585
Well.

294
00:28:56,793 --> 00:28:59,001
I would like to offer you a task.

295
00:29:00,873 --> 00:29:04,165
"The innocent revenge".
Is not that what the newspapers call you?

296
00:29:04,333 --> 00:29:07,457
Are you innocent?
- I am a businessman.

297
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:12,457
I am an art dealer. I think
I've started shopping with art.

298
00:29:12,585 --> 00:29:15,457
But I have had a startover.

299
00:29:16,333 --> 00:29:21,293
Relics, antiques.
Quirky carpets. Oriental objects.

300
00:29:22,249 --> 00:29:26,665
I'm new to the game so I
have an amateur look at it.

301
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:30,665
I have a small problem with the...

302
00:29:30,833 --> 00:29:35,001
so-called valuers.
You can not count on one of them.

303
00:29:37,293 --> 00:29:40,001
Some of my customers...

304
00:29:40,165 --> 00:29:45,585
Buying an item that they discover
is not entirely original.

305
00:29:45,793 --> 00:29:51,001
And it's hardly my fault if a
kashan silk scarf is fake.

306
00:29:51,165 --> 00:29:53,585
<i>Well?
- C'est bon.</i>

307
00:29:56,001 --> 00:29:58,501
But I've got a few enemies.

308
00:29:58,665 --> 00:30:01,873
I have received letters.
People have threatened me.

309
00:30:02,873 --> 00:30:05,457
I think they are Italians.

310
00:30:06,085 --> 00:30:10,085
I sold them some oriental
carpets in Milan.

311
00:30:11,373 --> 00:30:15,209
And the buyers were not so happy
with the carpet of the carpets.

312
00:30:16,417 --> 00:30:19,333
And they want the money
back with interest rates.

313
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:22,541
Italians. Such are the spaghetti eggs.

314
00:30:23,541 --> 00:30:28,501
And then comes the ingenious detective.
- Me?

315
00:30:28,665 --> 00:30:32,085
Yes, you. Hercules Poirot.
- Hercule.

316
00:30:35,585 --> 00:30:40,125
I would like to hire you
to take care of me -

317
00:30:40,293 --> 00:30:43,417
- Until I'm safe.

318
00:30:43,585 --> 00:30:47,873
It's easy money for you.
And then I get calm.

319
00:30:48,041 --> 00:30:52,957
I understand that. I refuse.
- Hvabehar? It's bad.

320
00:30:54,165 --> 00:30:57,417
Maybe I have not made it clear enough.

321
00:30:57,585 --> 00:31:01,585
Someone is looking after me.

322
00:31:01,749 --> 00:31:05,585
And I know that I am by far
the best child of God.

323
00:31:05,793 --> 00:31:09,873
And if there is a life after death, then
I will be judged there just like you.

324
00:31:10,041 --> 00:31:12,001
But...

325
00:31:13,457 --> 00:31:16,793
I'm not busy reaching that.

326
00:31:17,249 --> 00:31:21,957
They threaten me with a gun.
- No. Not you. Worldwide.

327
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:24,501
I exist in the world.
Do not aim at me.

328
00:31:24,665 --> 00:31:28,501
What do you say to 10,000 for a week?
- Generously, but I have to say no.

329
00:31:28,665 --> 00:31:30,917
15,000?
- They did not hear me. No.

330
00:31:31,085 --> 00:31:33,249
I understand now.

331
00:31:33,417 --> 00:31:39,417
It's not flashy enough for the great
Hercules Poirot? No flash lights.

332
00:31:39,585 --> 00:31:42,293
They sell copies to gangsters,
and now you have to suffer.

333
00:31:42,457 --> 00:31:45,957
I catch criminals.
I do not protect them.

334
00:31:46,125 --> 00:31:50,333
So you say no to my dirty money.
- I say no to you, mr. Ratchett.

335
00:31:51,373 --> 00:31:55,957
It was with the gun, right?
- It's far more personal than that.

336
00:31:57,709 --> 00:32:00,665
I do not like your face.

337
00:32:02,209 --> 00:32:04,041
They have to apologize.

338
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:07,165
They liked my cake, right?

339
00:32:07,333 --> 00:32:11,249
The cake was excellent.
Have a good afternoon, mr. Ratchett.

340
00:32:35,793 --> 00:32:37,793
Thanks.

341
00:32:39,041 --> 00:32:40,873
It is cold.

342
00:33:00,541 --> 00:33:03,249
My dear Katherine.

343
00:33:04,793 --> 00:33:07,373
My Beloved.

344
00:33:17,125 --> 00:33:19,165
Mr. Dickens.

345
00:33:33,709 --> 00:33:35,793
Mr. Ratchett?

346
00:33:43,165 --> 00:33:44,873
Mr. Ratchett?

347
00:33:45,001 --> 00:33:47,125
There is nothing.

348
00:33:48,165 --> 00:33:49,541
Fine. Good night.

349
00:34:07,165 --> 00:34:08,793
<i>Une autre affair.</i>

350
00:34:11,125 --> 00:34:14,085
Mrs. Hubbard?
- It's always Mrs. Hubbard.

351
00:34:14,249 --> 00:34:15,749
Mrs. Hubbard.

352
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:12,165
Did we die?

353
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:15,001
Ladies and gentlemen,
the train has escaped.

354
00:35:15,665 --> 00:35:20,293
Is everything good, mr. Marquez?
- Yes i am fine. Thanks.

355
00:35:20,457 --> 00:35:24,293
Mr. Bouc talks with you tomorrow.
You are safest in the cabinets.

356
00:35:24,457 --> 00:35:27,709
Of course.
- Shall we die now?

357
00:35:35,959 --> 00:35:37,875
My Katherine.

358
00:35:39,959 --> 00:35:41,875
My beautiful...

359
00:36:25,375 --> 00:36:30,039
Ladies and gentlemen, unfortunately,
the train can not continue.

360
00:36:30,207 --> 00:36:33,039
It may then fall.
- How long should we sit here?

361
00:36:33,207 --> 00:36:35,583
Yes. Someone must do something.

362
00:36:35,751 --> 00:36:38,623
Of course I do something.
I do nothing.

363
00:36:38,751 --> 00:36:42,999
For two hours and ten minutes ago,
when we did not arrive at Brod, -

364
00:36:43,167 --> 00:36:45,583
<i>- Has the station warden
calculated the situation?</i>

365
00:36:45,751 --> 00:36:48,415
<i>- and sent people out to
dig the locomotive, -</i>

366
00:36:48,583 --> 00:36:50,831
<i>- clear the track and send us away.</i>

367
00:36:50,999 --> 00:36:55,751
Until then, I assure you that we
will feel warm and saturated.

368
00:36:56,415 --> 00:37:00,375
We could go.
"We could die of cold.

369
00:37:00,539 --> 00:37:05,499
I'll go on. My ferry departs from
France the day after tomorrow.

370
00:37:05,959 --> 00:37:09,251
Without you I will believe.
And I'm not coming to London.

371
00:37:09,415 --> 00:37:14,707
They are responsible for the waste of my time.
- They can not give me responsibility for the weather.

372
00:37:14,875 --> 00:37:16,959
Of course. They are the one here.

373
00:37:17,123 --> 00:37:19,251
And my conference in Turin?

374
00:37:19,415 --> 00:37:21,667
I was going to meet at the
automobile factory in Sochaux.

375
00:37:22,167 --> 00:37:24,539
Certain things are in God's hands.

376
00:37:25,123 --> 00:37:30,707
We can not know if we deserve to
come safely to our destination, -

377
00:37:31,875 --> 00:37:35,707
- or if we, like Lucifer,
have to crash to the ground.

378
00:37:46,707 --> 00:37:49,123
Then there's breakfast, mr. Ratchett.

379
00:37:50,583 --> 00:37:52,583
<i>Bonjour,</i>

380
00:37:54,123 --> 00:37:57,123
Is there a problem?
- I do not know.

381
00:37:57,291 --> 00:37:59,167
Mr. Ratchett?

382
00:38:07,751 --> 00:38:09,831
Excuse me.

383
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:18,583
It's cold air.
Get Monsieur Bouc and Dr. Arbuthnot.

384
00:38:39,207 --> 00:38:43,415
You good god!
- Touch nothing but the body.

385
00:38:46,915 --> 00:38:51,667
Oh god, that's terrible.
First the snow and now...

386
00:38:51,831 --> 00:38:54,751
Now I have to talk to the
police at a dingy station.

387
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:57,751
And a man is dead.

388
00:38:57,915 --> 00:39:01,623
And a man is dead.
- He became obsessed.

389
00:39:01,751 --> 00:39:06,291
A long knife without thanks. More stitch years.
Some superficial, others into the bone.

390
00:39:06,459 --> 00:39:09,751
On the left or right side?
- That's right.

391
00:39:09,915 --> 00:39:14,123
It seems that the killer might have
closed his eyes and stuck in the blind.

392
00:39:14,291 --> 00:39:17,707
Can you estimate the deadline?

393
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:20,251
It's hard to say since
the window is open.

394
00:39:20,415 --> 00:39:23,291
I will guess between midnight and two.

395
00:39:23,459 --> 00:39:29,039
But nobody walked into his coup.
I sat here all night. Impossible.

396
00:39:30,751 --> 00:39:34,751
Thanks. Be sure to go back to the stroller.
Michel, locks this wagon.

397
00:39:36,959 --> 00:39:39,039
Poirot.

398
00:39:41,667 --> 00:39:43,623
I need help, my friend.

399
00:39:46,999 --> 00:39:51,415
You must find the guilty one. On behalf of the
Orient Express, I make you feel confident.

400
00:39:51,583 --> 00:39:55,831
When the police arrive, we have clarified
the case. Only you can save me.

401
00:39:55,999 --> 00:39:59,999
<i>Mon cher.
But I have to rest.</i>

402
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:03,207
Think of it like a small headache
while lying on the beach.

403
00:40:03,375 --> 00:40:07,499
There is nothing for your mind.
You are examining the passengers' background.

404
00:40:07,667 --> 00:40:11,083
You determine if they are sincere.
And then you do what you do.

405
00:40:11,251 --> 00:40:15,583
You sit in your chair and eat your cake.

406
00:40:15,751 --> 00:40:17,915
And then you think until
the solution turns out.

407
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:22,623
What else do you want while we're caught?
Your brain cells die without challenges.

408
00:40:22,751 --> 00:40:26,459
Do you think I'm just sitting and
eating cake until I get a good idea?

409
00:40:26,623 --> 00:40:29,707
I do not know what you're doing.
- I'm reading Dickens.

410
00:40:30,583 --> 00:40:35,207
If we leave this to the police,
they are just a random person.

411
00:40:35,375 --> 00:40:38,875
Enough Mr. Marquez, just
because he is called Marquez.

412
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:41,667
Or dr. Arbuthnot because
of his skin tone.

413
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:50,167
Only you can make sure that
justice is done the most.

414
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:56,499
I need a drawing over this wagon.
And everyone's passports.

415
00:40:56,667 --> 00:41:01,751
I will talk to all passengers. Prove, order,
method until the guilty one turns out.

416
00:41:01,915 --> 00:41:05,959
I do not like murder, my friend.
Every day we meet plain people, -

417
00:41:06,123 --> 00:41:10,167
- but we do not kill them.
We must be better than the beasts.

418
00:41:11,959 --> 00:41:14,375
So let's find this killer.

419
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,707
What's going on?

420
00:41:18,623 --> 00:41:21,415
Ladies and gentlemen, allow me...

421
00:41:21,583 --> 00:41:25,415
It seems that our crown's destiny
has become worse. Well...

422
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:28,583
A passenger is dead here on the train.

423
00:41:28,751 --> 00:41:30,875
Monsieur Ratchett.

424
00:41:39,623 --> 00:41:43,375
Then they got a grip on him.
- They assume he was murdered?

425
00:41:43,539 --> 00:41:47,915
No no. I just mean he
was in good health.

426
00:41:48,083 --> 00:41:51,751
He had enemies. Nothing else.
- Yes. And he was assassinated.

427
00:41:53,375 --> 00:41:57,583
You good god. Murder. Here?
- Unfortunately, madame.

428
00:41:57,751 --> 00:42:00,459
God preserve his soul.

429
00:42:00,623 --> 00:42:03,751
Someone walked around in my couch
in the middle of the night.

430
00:42:03,959 --> 00:42:05,959
No one believed in me.

431
00:42:07,875 --> 00:42:09,083
What's going on?

432
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:11,667
As we get stuck,
I've got the case.

433
00:42:11,831 --> 00:42:16,123
I want to find the culprit.
- And why did you see?

434
00:42:17,251 --> 00:42:21,915
My name is Hercule Poirot, and I'm
probably the world's best detective.

435
00:42:22,459 --> 00:42:25,123
I want to talk to you
all, but right now -

436
00:42:25,291 --> 00:42:27,915
- Do you have to stay in your
cabin with the door locked.

437
00:42:28,083 --> 00:42:32,331
I feel caught here.
- It's for their safety sake.

438
00:42:32,499 --> 00:42:34,583
If a murder has been committed, -

439
00:42:34,751 --> 00:42:36,751
- so here was a killer.

440
00:42:37,751 --> 00:42:39,667
The killer is among us, -

441
00:42:40,167 --> 00:42:43,459
- on board the train now

442
00:42:54,083 --> 00:42:57,331
The doors between the cars
were locked at night, right?

443
00:42:57,499 --> 00:42:59,331
Yes. I did it myself.

444
00:42:59,499 --> 00:43:01,875
The train is crawled.
Nobody hides here.

445
00:43:02,039 --> 00:43:06,875
Therefore, we can limit the investigation
to the passengers in the Calais caravan.

446
00:43:07,039 --> 00:43:10,751
Bouc, you assist me. As the only one
who has slept in another wagon,

447
00:43:10,915 --> 00:43:12,875
- You're only out of suspicion.

448
00:43:21,499 --> 00:43:24,999
Mr. MacQueen, should
you really drink now?

449
00:43:25,167 --> 00:43:30,415
My boss is dead. I'm unemployed and you
look at me, like I was the killer.

450
00:43:30,583 --> 00:43:34,667
We do not accuse anyone. They knew him
so we must get information from you.

451
00:43:34,831 --> 00:43:40,291
Were you his relative?
No, his secretary.

452
00:43:41,751 --> 00:43:46,123
I ordered his tickets and steaks.

453
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:49,707
The man ate more steaks than
I have seen my whole life.

454
00:43:49,875 --> 00:43:52,039
He acted with antiques.

455
00:43:52,207 --> 00:43:55,375
He had no qualifications, no
glance or language for it.

456
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:58,959
The truth is that he had no
talent for trading or accounting.

457
00:43:59,123 --> 00:44:01,751
None of it I arranged everything.

458
00:44:01,959 --> 00:44:04,415
How long did you work for him?

459
00:44:04,583 --> 00:44:07,415
Twenty days less than a year.

460
00:44:07,583 --> 00:44:11,207
The ban on spirits did not hate me, -

461
00:44:13,167 --> 00:44:16,167
- so I ended abroad with a debt.

462
00:44:19,459 --> 00:44:22,039
I am a lawyer of education, -

463
00:44:22,207 --> 00:44:26,375
- not by nature I was terrible about it.

464
00:44:27,123 --> 00:44:30,959
Did you hold him?
- I loved his money.

465
00:44:31,123 --> 00:44:37,499
Ratchett was rough. Demanding,
insulting and probably crimes.

466
00:44:37,667 --> 00:44:41,583
<i>When did you see him last?
"It must have been just after 22.</i>

467
00:44:41,751 --> 00:44:46,583
We had to go through sales in Italy.
- The fakes in Milan?

468
00:44:46,751 --> 00:44:51,375
Yes. Yes. He would look at the accounts.

469
00:44:51,539 --> 00:44:56,039
I had to translate because the contracts
were in French and he understood nothing.

470
00:44:56,915 --> 00:45:00,999
<i>When we stopped in Vinkovci, I messed
up with the colored doctor, Arbuthnot.</i>

471
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:03,291
<i>We got a few drinks and stretched our legs.</i>

472
00:45:03,459 --> 00:45:08,331
He had some strange attitudes to
Stalin, I had to speak against.

473
00:45:08,499 --> 00:45:12,083
I do not care for skin color, but
I do not like British people.

474
00:45:13,039 --> 00:45:14,583
When did your party end?

475
00:45:14,751 --> 00:45:17,539
He walked shortly after two o'clock.

476
00:45:17,707 --> 00:45:20,915
Do you know any specific
enemies that Ratchett had?

477
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:23,959
My Goodness. They stood in line.

478
00:45:24,123 --> 00:45:28,707
Did he say he received threats?
He got some ugly letters.

479
00:45:28,875 --> 00:45:32,167
I have them if you want to see them.
Some of them at least.

480
00:45:32,331 --> 00:45:34,499
He tore the rest into pieces.

481
00:45:35,623 --> 00:45:37,415
He burned some.

482
00:45:39,915 --> 00:45:40,915
Here.

483
00:45:41,083 --> 00:45:42,915
PLEASE, FOR ELLERS...

484
00:45:43,083 --> 00:45:45,831
NOW SHOULD NEVER BE OS

485
00:45:46,207 --> 00:45:49,331
<i>Merci,
- Thanks.</i>

486
00:45:49,499 --> 00:45:52,499
If we have more questions,
we'll call you.

487
00:45:56,167 --> 00:46:00,083
Have you considered the Spaniard?
Marquez. A hell man.

488
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:04,831
And you know his kind.

489
00:46:04,999 --> 00:46:09,167
They do not have the same contempt
for murder, historically.

490
00:46:09,331 --> 00:46:12,123
They said you do not make a difference in skin tone.

491
00:46:12,291 --> 00:46:14,583
The...

492
00:46:14,751 --> 00:46:16,751
depends on the skin color.

493
00:46:22,831 --> 00:46:24,667
He did otherwise look great.

494
00:46:24,831 --> 00:46:26,583
Is it MacQueen?
- It is not known.

495
00:46:26,751 --> 00:46:29,167
I can not see him
hiding a man 12 times.

496
00:46:29,331 --> 00:46:32,539
Not sober. Who was that?
- It is not known. We must ask.

497
00:46:32,707 --> 00:46:34,583
Ask who?
- Offered.

498
00:47:10,207 --> 00:47:14,623
He has 12 sticks, and as Arbuthnot
noted, there is no pattern in them.

499
00:47:14,751 --> 00:47:18,623
If the doctor did, he has
not let it color his work.

500
00:47:18,751 --> 00:47:22,751
The watch. It stopped at 01.15.
It confirms the doctor's death date.

501
00:47:22,915 --> 00:47:24,875
Possibly yes.

502
00:47:25,039 --> 00:47:28,623
I do not understand.
- I do not understand anything myself either.

503
00:47:28,751 --> 00:47:30,707
If you look at the two wounds here, -

504
00:47:30,875 --> 00:47:34,039
- it's deep sore, but there
is only a little blood.

505
00:47:34,207 --> 00:47:36,831
But the killer attacked in fury.

506
00:47:36,999 --> 00:47:41,539
It was stung in vain, completely without
pattern. Pure, extreme violence.

507
00:47:41,707 --> 00:47:45,583
And under all this lies our victim,
who is tense and stuffed with coffee,

508
00:47:45,751 --> 00:47:49,083
- Quietly and accepting the
coming of death without fighting.

509
00:47:49,251 --> 00:47:55,459
And he otherwise has a
means to defend himself.

510
00:47:56,123 --> 00:47:57,751
Here you go.

511
00:47:57,959 --> 00:48:00,539
Let's see here.

512
00:48:03,623 --> 00:48:06,751
Veronal. Goodnight Mediterranean.

513
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:10,539
He became anesthetized so
he could not use it here.

514
00:48:10,707 --> 00:48:12,999
And around this, a
ladies handkerchief.

515
00:48:13,167 --> 00:48:16,623
<i>Objet de luxe.
200 francs in Paris.</i>

516
00:48:16,751 --> 00:48:19,291
The original embroidered initial. "H."

517
00:48:19,459 --> 00:48:22,751
And our little friend, the piber sensor.
- Another track.

518
00:48:22,915 --> 00:48:25,583
Yes. A wealth of very convenient tracks.

519
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:30,415
But only one of them seems real.

520
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:33,499
Perhaps this ashtray will give
us an unintentional trace.

521
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:38,999
A charred residue of a message.
Maybe an attempt to burn a proof.

522
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:48,415
Thank you. You will arrive at the right time.

523
00:48:49,459 --> 00:48:52,083
Should we borrow your equipment?
- Thanks.

524
00:48:52,331 --> 00:48:55,415
<i>C'est parfait. C'est parfait.
Merci, merci.</i>

525
00:48:55,583 --> 00:49:02,415
I prefer to understand why a track
was left, rather than what it is.

526
00:49:05,083 --> 00:49:07,207
We seek the truth from the inside, not from the outside.

527
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:12,415
In this case, however, I
welcome some scientific help.

528
00:49:12,831 --> 00:49:15,123
Adjust the flame.

529
00:49:15,999 --> 00:49:17,959
Come on!

530
00:49:21,999 --> 00:49:24,707
It's just another of the ugly letters.

531
00:49:25,459 --> 00:49:29,039
<i>Mon ami.
Carries on a secret.</i>

532
00:49:29,207 --> 00:49:31,167
See.

533
00:49:33,875 --> 00:49:38,167
"You have ice and blood there.
You will die."

534
00:49:38,331 --> 00:49:40,083
What does it mean?

535
00:49:42,539 --> 00:49:44,207
Come on, Bouc.

536
00:49:44,751 --> 00:49:46,751
Let's fill out the holes.

537
00:49:47,959 --> 00:49:50,583
This was never a beach headache.

538
00:49:52,583 --> 00:49:54,915
I know the real name of the dead man.

539
00:49:56,375 --> 00:50:00,751
He's not called Ratchett, but Cassetti.

540
00:50:00,959 --> 00:50:04,959
I know that name.
- Then you also know the name Armstrong.

541
00:50:05,123 --> 00:50:09,291
<i>Armstrong case?
- History shocked the world.</i>

542
00:50:09,459 --> 00:50:12,831
<i>Two years ago, the famous pilot
Colonel John Armstrong woke up -</i>

543
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:16,999
<i>- and his wife, Sonia, got up and found
out that their only child, daisy,</i>

544
00:50:17,167 --> 00:50:20,167
<i>- had been taken from her
crib while she was sleeping</i>

545
00:50:21,415 --> 00:50:24,499
<i>In desperation,
Armstrong paid the sum.</i>

546
00:50:24,667 --> 00:50:32,459
<i>But then Daisy was found murdered by...
- Ratchett, who was Cassetti.</i>

547
00:50:33,751 --> 00:50:37,499
<i>Sonia Armstrong was with
children when she got the news.</i>

548
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,623
<i>The shock caused her to
go to birth before time.</i>

549
00:50:40,751 --> 00:50:46,251
<i>Neither she nor the child survived.
- Where do you know, Poirot?</i>

550
00:50:46,415 --> 00:50:48,751
Because John Armstrong
told me so.

551
00:50:48,959 --> 00:50:52,999
He wrote and asked for help, but
when I received his letter,

552
00:50:54,167 --> 00:50:55,999
was it too late?

553
00:50:57,751 --> 00:51:00,251
<i>He was found dead by a shooting year.</i>

554
00:51:01,623 --> 00:51:03,831
<i>Self-inflicted.</i>

555
00:51:05,707 --> 00:51:10,959
"You have Daisy Armstrong's blood
on your hands. You must die."

556
00:51:11,123 --> 00:51:13,623
And you did that.

557
00:51:13,751 --> 00:51:15,623
Monsieur Poirot?

558
00:51:15,751 --> 00:51:19,375
Mrs. Hubbard would like to talk to you.
I have tried to keep her.

559
00:51:20,331 --> 00:51:25,123
Sorry for the wait. They have their head
full of steam and mouth full of words.

560
00:51:25,291 --> 00:51:29,539
You can cope with that. What have
I tried to tell you all day?

561
00:51:29,707 --> 00:51:33,375
The killer was in my couch tonight.

562
00:51:33,831 --> 00:51:39,039
I thought I would be murdered, but then
Ratchett was assassinated instead.

563
00:51:39,207 --> 00:51:42,167
I woke up and knew
there was a man there.

564
00:51:42,291 --> 00:51:44,331
Are you sure it was a man?

565
00:51:44,875 --> 00:51:48,123
I know the feeling that there
is a man in my bedroom.

566
00:51:48,291 --> 00:51:51,123
I told the conductor, but
he did not believe me.

567
00:51:51,291 --> 00:51:54,039
I said, "Look at the door between
my couch and Ratchetts."

568
00:51:54,207 --> 00:51:59,039
"He must have come out that way."
And, quite right, it was unlocked.

569
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,831
I know I locked it after
what Ratchett said.

570
00:52:02,999 --> 00:52:06,415
He made clear approximations.

571
00:52:07,207 --> 00:52:11,331
Have you heard of
Armstrong abduction?

572
00:52:12,583 --> 00:52:15,583
That could not be avoided.
A morbid case.

573
00:52:15,747 --> 00:52:18,459
The child's murderer, Cassetti, -

574
00:52:18,623 --> 00:52:22,999
died in the night
That was Ratchett.

575
00:52:23,915 --> 00:52:27,667
I said that there was
something foolish about him.

576
00:52:29,123 --> 00:52:32,415
They think that there
was a man inside me?

577
00:52:32,583 --> 00:52:36,999
I know you think I'm a silly
lady, but I can prove it.

578
00:52:40,831 --> 00:52:43,539
It is from a conductor on
the Orientekress uniform.

579
00:52:43,707 --> 00:52:46,123
- but it may have been
dropped by Michel's uniform.

580
00:52:47,331 --> 00:52:52,707
I do not need any buttons.
- I found it right by my bed.

581
00:52:52,875 --> 00:52:56,415
What do you call it?
- Proof. Thank you very much, Mrs. Hubbard.

582
00:53:02,083 --> 00:53:05,207
Have you been to America?
- A single time.

583
00:53:05,375 --> 00:53:09,039
It's been many years ago. A short trip.
- For what purpose?

584
00:53:09,207 --> 00:53:11,331
To confirm a suspicion.
- And it was?

585
00:53:11,459 --> 00:53:14,707
That I would not mind it.
I was offered a job in Boston.

586
00:53:14,875 --> 00:53:18,291
I saw Boston and went to London again.
- Is that where Ratchett was from?

587
00:53:18,459 --> 00:53:20,583
I do not know.

588
00:53:20,747 --> 00:53:23,747
It would be inappropriate to ask.

589
00:53:25,667 --> 00:53:26,667
Continue.

590
00:53:26,831 --> 00:53:31,623
I saw last mr. Ratchett at 21.

591
00:53:31,791 --> 00:53:35,875
I brought him his coffee
and hung his clothes up.

592
00:53:40,375 --> 00:53:42,791
They have toothache.

593
00:53:43,707 --> 00:53:45,747
I must have pulled a tooth out in London.

594
00:53:45,915 --> 00:53:49,459
Mr. Ratchett insisted that it
could not wait any longer.

595
00:53:49,623 --> 00:53:51,959
He was tired of
listening to my dreams.

596
00:53:52,123 --> 00:53:55,959
The compassionate Ratchett, did he
always drink coffee in the evening?

597
00:53:56,123 --> 00:54:00,375
Certainly not.
But he had been tense.

598
00:54:00,539 --> 00:54:04,459
He said he would stay awake.
Especially last night.

599
00:54:04,623 --> 00:54:07,039
He found a letter in his coup.

600
00:54:08,207 --> 00:54:10,207
Say it was not you.

601
00:54:10,375 --> 00:54:14,831
Should I leave something uncomfortable on
your pillow, it would not be a letter.

602
00:54:15,831 --> 00:54:17,747
Coffee.

603
00:54:19,915 --> 00:54:26,415
Such a proper and precise valet would
never speak to his master like that?

604
00:54:27,415 --> 00:54:31,915
Unless he knew that his
career would soon...

605
00:54:32,999 --> 00:54:35,083
end.

606
00:54:35,999 --> 00:54:38,623
Not just a toothache, I think.

607
00:54:39,875 --> 00:54:41,959
The lungs?

608
00:54:43,791 --> 00:54:45,915
Thyroid.

609
00:54:46,083 --> 00:54:49,915
It has spread. It also took the life of
my father when he was five years younger.

610
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:53,915
Months, at best.

611
00:54:54,999 --> 00:55:00,167
"Can not be operated, I'm afraid,"
said the doctor. Suddenly I was not afraid.

612
00:55:00,999 --> 00:55:05,291
From then on, I did as I would.
Now I speak freely from the liver.

613
00:55:06,791 --> 00:55:08,459
The coffee.

614
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:12,791
Someone had come to Veronal in his cup.
They will say it was not you.

615
00:55:12,959 --> 00:55:17,459
Of course not.
- When and where did you get coffee and cups?

616
00:55:17,915 --> 00:55:23,747
From the kitchen.
I ordered the coffee until 21 o'clock.

617
00:55:23,915 --> 00:55:27,207
Anyone may have grabbed the coffee before me.

618
00:55:27,539 --> 00:55:28,831
<i>Merci.</i>

619
00:55:34,791 --> 00:55:38,915
Mr. Masterman.
It hurts my toothache.

620
00:55:47,667 --> 00:55:50,999
<i>Merci, merci.
I love so much of the little cakes.</i>

621
00:55:52,331 --> 00:55:54,747
Well, miss Pilar Estravados,
you are a missionary.

622
00:55:54,915 --> 00:55:57,247
- but you are a nurse
trained, right?

623
00:55:58,207 --> 00:56:02,167
I owe it to God.
- Did you pay him debt?

624
00:56:03,459 --> 00:56:05,459
There was...

625
00:56:06,791 --> 00:56:09,623
enjoyable times in my life, -

626
00:56:10,539 --> 00:56:14,123
- where I took more than I gave.

627
00:56:14,291 --> 00:56:18,415
Gerhard Hardman.
Professor of Engineering.

628
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:23,123
It is science that will
regain Germany its honor.

629
00:56:23,291 --> 00:56:25,291
Biniamino Marquez.
- Mr. Marquez.

630
00:56:25,459 --> 00:56:29,291
I want to be cleansed for any connection
to the murder, so finally ask.

631
00:56:29,459 --> 00:56:31,747
About anything.
I do not lie anymore.

632
00:56:31,915 --> 00:56:33,915
Did you leave your couch last night?

633
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:37,247
Only once to get an aspirin.

634
00:56:37,415 --> 00:56:39,959
Mrs. Hubbard offered me a previous one.

635
00:56:40,123 --> 00:56:43,915
I first refused the offer, but when
I could not find rest I went there.

636
00:56:44,083 --> 00:56:46,291
My conference is held in Turin.

637
00:56:46,459 --> 00:56:50,167
I'm the only Austrian speaker
there, so without me -

638
00:56:50,331 --> 00:56:52,415
- Will quality drop.

639
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:55,583
Then I fled from prison,
settled in America -

640
00:56:55,747 --> 00:56:58,167
- and swore that I would
not lie or steal.

641
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,123
When people trust one,
they buy more things.

642
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:04,915
Italians are some cows.
Spanioles are sheep.

643
00:57:05,083 --> 00:57:06,915
Belgians...

644
00:57:08,539 --> 00:57:13,167
I went to my couch, which I
share with the sad butler.

645
00:57:13,331 --> 00:57:15,667
A special fish. He hurts a lot.

646
00:57:15,831 --> 00:57:18,747
I'm sure he saw me
sleeping here all night.

647
00:57:19,415 --> 00:57:23,291
I have to say, if relevant, -

648
00:57:23,459 --> 00:57:25,831
that there was an awkward moment.

649
00:57:25,999 --> 00:57:30,083
When I went to mrs. Hubbard, I
first came to open the wrong door.

650
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:32,539
Pardon.

651
00:57:32,707 --> 00:57:35,375
<i>When did this happen?
- It must have been...</i>

652
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:36,831
You should not say that.

653
00:57:37,791 --> 00:57:39,791
Twenty minutes in eleven.

654
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:42,623
Interesting.

655
00:57:42,791 --> 00:57:46,791
As far as you know, you're the
last one who saw Ratchett alive.

656
00:57:48,999 --> 00:57:52,083
Your industry?
- Automobiles. I have three sales outlets.

657
00:57:52,247 --> 00:57:55,375
I was totally empty-handed
to America, and now...

658
00:57:55,539 --> 00:57:59,539
If appropriate, she confirms it.
- It suits.

659
00:57:59,707 --> 00:58:03,583
I am not lying. I am not lying.

660
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:07,291
Could Miss Debenham leave
the car without notice?

661
00:58:07,459 --> 00:58:10,083
No. I sleep very easily.

662
00:58:10,247 --> 00:58:13,247
I get up at the slightest sound.

663
00:58:15,123 --> 00:58:17,123
I was once surprised.

664
00:58:18,831 --> 00:58:20,707
It should not happen again.

665
00:58:20,875 --> 00:58:25,375
No, I did not say I was a driver.
- The pictures that fell out of your luggage.

666
00:58:25,539 --> 00:58:29,539
There was a beautiful one of a
little boy with a driver's bin, -

667
00:58:29,707 --> 00:58:32,831
- who visited his father at work.
Who were you the driver for?

668
00:58:34,083 --> 00:58:37,291
Your hands have hard
skin like a boxer.

669
00:58:37,459 --> 00:58:40,039
I work in dangerous cities, -

670
00:58:40,167 --> 00:58:43,915
where I can not control fear.
I have combat training.

671
00:58:44,083 --> 00:58:47,247
They do not trust your God
anymore after the surprise?

672
00:58:47,415 --> 00:58:49,959
It is in the event that he is busy.

673
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:52,083
God is always busy.

674
00:58:52,831 --> 00:58:54,291
<i>It's Masterman.</i>

675
00:58:54,459 --> 00:58:58,207
A dying man has nothing to lose.
- Bravo, but then there is Marquez.

676
00:58:58,375 --> 00:59:03,623
He has confirmed that Masterman lay in
bed and read at the time of murder.

677
00:59:03,791 --> 00:59:07,375
If that was easy, I would
not be famous. Next.

678
00:59:14,791 --> 00:59:17,583
Miss Debenham, They do not
mind a little fresh air?

679
00:59:17,747 --> 00:59:20,459
For your sake, a picnic.

680
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:24,247
While you let my partner live
under the narrow space. Yes.

681
00:59:24,415 --> 00:59:27,083
Choose the best place to get
the truth out of suspects.

682
00:59:27,247 --> 00:59:30,583
She had to be pressed, I should freeze.
How nice.

683
00:59:30,747 --> 00:59:33,707
Do you want to write your full
name and address, thanks?

684
00:59:33,875 --> 00:59:35,539
Dusted light-colored.

685
00:59:35,707 --> 00:59:39,875
Miss Estravados said that you asked
about the color of her robes.

686
00:59:41,539 --> 00:59:45,291
<i>Merci.</i>

687
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,083
Do you ever call Hermione?

688
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:52,539
I'm always Mary when I'm not employed
as Miss Debenham. Left handed.

689
00:59:53,247 --> 00:59:58,539
It is unusual, yes. They must be in
doubt if you test my handwriting.

690
00:59:58,707 --> 01:00:01,083
What did you think about deceased?

691
01:00:01,247 --> 01:00:04,167
I can not say I thought about him.

692
01:00:05,831 --> 01:00:11,247
I do not understand the relevance of this.
- Forgive me my eccentricity.

693
01:00:12,747 --> 01:00:15,167
Human nature is pervert complex.

694
01:00:15,331 --> 01:00:19,167
To drill in it you must
have the right tools.

695
01:00:19,331 --> 01:00:22,667
It's a toy, not a tool, Hercule.
Be sure to put them from you.

696
01:00:22,831 --> 01:00:28,039
<i>Parfait.
Did you know Dr. Arbuthnot before the train departed?</i>

697
01:00:29,831 --> 01:00:31,667
No.

698
01:00:33,459 --> 01:00:35,415
But such an instant crush?

699
01:00:38,875 --> 01:00:44,123
We are not in America, miss Debenham.
Their feelings are not prohibited here.

700
01:00:47,415 --> 01:00:52,331
There is also no ban on
silence that I choose to...

701
01:00:54,791 --> 01:00:56,959
I've never been to America.

702
01:00:58,915 --> 01:01:04,415
Maybe I may ask for some
words that I heard.

703
01:01:04,583 --> 01:01:08,583
De and Arbuthnot are more closely
linked than strangers tend to be.

704
01:01:08,747 --> 01:01:10,747
They said:

705
01:01:10,915 --> 01:01:15,207
"Not now. When it's over.
Then no one can do anything to us. "

706
01:01:15,375 --> 01:01:18,247
What did you mean by that?

707
01:01:18,415 --> 01:01:21,167
Do you think I meant murder?

708
01:01:21,331 --> 01:01:25,959
When you have a hammer, it looks like everything's nails.
They live and breathe for crime.

709
01:01:26,123 --> 01:01:28,247
They see evil every single day.
- No.

710
01:01:28,415 --> 01:01:32,915
I see enough crimes to know that
the crime is the deviation.

711
01:01:33,083 --> 01:01:36,123
One's soul must be broken, -

712
01:01:36,375 --> 01:01:38,915
- in order to murder another human being

713
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:44,291
I ask again.
What did you mean?

714
01:01:46,583 --> 01:01:48,459
As mentioned earlier,

715
01:01:48,667 --> 01:01:51,539
- then my silence is not forbidden.

716
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:55,459
Fine.

717
01:02:04,747 --> 01:02:07,415
<i>And afterward, Princess Dragomiroff?</i>

718
01:02:07,583 --> 01:02:09,999
After dinner I went to bed.

719
01:02:11,039 --> 01:02:17,167
God has blessed me with a long life
and a bad back to make it unbearable.

720
01:02:17,875 --> 01:02:22,375
About a quarter of a century
I called Fräulein Schmidt.

721
01:02:22,539 --> 01:02:25,999
She gave me a massage and read
out loud for me. Then I slept.

722
01:02:27,459 --> 01:02:32,291
Are you familiar with a
family called Armstrong?

723
01:02:39,667 --> 01:02:43,123
They were exposed to an inconceivable tragedy.

724
01:02:43,291 --> 01:02:49,083
I admired Sonia Armstrong's
mother, actress, Linda Arden.

725
01:02:49,247 --> 01:02:52,247
A talent you see only
once every century.

726
01:02:53,247 --> 01:02:56,415
Miss Arden would be an instructor.

727
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,247
She would have become the first
female Broadway giant, -

728
01:03:01,415 --> 01:03:03,331
- if it was not for the tragedy.

729
01:03:03,459 --> 01:03:09,123
And is this Linda Arden also dead?
- She could be as well.

730
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:12,583
She does not leave her home.

731
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:16,791
Daisy was my goddess.

732
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:19,831
She was a...

733
01:03:30,375 --> 01:03:33,539
I do not understand what this
has to do with our problems.

734
01:03:33,707 --> 01:03:37,291
The murdered man's real
name was Cassetti.

735
01:03:37,459 --> 01:03:40,539
The man who murdered
Little Daisy Armstrong.

736
01:03:45,831 --> 01:03:50,875
Yes. I acknowledge that I know the
family and now this man is dead.

737
01:03:51,707 --> 01:03:55,291
The collapse must be
almost unbearable.

738
01:03:56,083 --> 01:03:59,083
A coincidence is allowed to you.

739
01:04:00,915 --> 01:04:03,999
Now I have to ask some questions
for your news Schmidt.

740
01:04:04,167 --> 01:04:07,083
You do not need that.
I live for her character.

741
01:04:07,247 --> 01:04:09,667
Anyway, with your permission...

742
01:04:10,583 --> 01:04:15,291
Please answer in German.
- So excellency does not understand me.

743
01:04:15,583 --> 01:04:17,415
That's exactly it.

744
01:04:21,459 --> 01:04:23,459
Is that yours? H for Hildegarde?

745
01:04:26,415 --> 01:04:28,499
It's all too fine for me.

746
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:32,875
Did she really talk about tonight?

747
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:37,623
It was as she said.
She asked the conductor to pick me up.

748
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:41,539
Then I went to bed again.
Did you see anyone when you returned?

749
01:04:41,791 --> 01:04:43,583
Only the other conductor.

750
01:04:45,291 --> 01:04:47,875
The other conductor? Do you mean Michel?

751
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:50,707
No, someone other than
him who woke me up.

752
01:04:50,875 --> 01:04:52,999
Please come with.

753
01:04:54,207 --> 01:04:57,747
Are you sure you did not see him?
- Yes. It was a little man with short beard.

754
01:04:57,915 --> 01:05:00,123
There is no other conductor.
- Yes.

755
01:05:00,291 --> 01:05:02,875
His voice was bright and
the uniform was similar.

756
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:06,459
However, with a missing button.
Immediately give me your key.

757
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:10,459
We need to find a uniform and a red kimono.

758
01:05:10,623 --> 01:05:13,123
Thousands of photographs,
endless bunker of socks, -

759
01:05:13,291 --> 01:05:17,123
- robes in all shades except red,
and no forbidden conductor uniform.

760
01:05:17,291 --> 01:05:19,707
Have we seen all the passengers' luggage?

761
01:05:19,875 --> 01:05:24,583
Except Count and Countess Andrenyi's
luggage. It must not be crawled.

762
01:05:24,747 --> 01:05:28,583
They travel under diplomatic leave.
Where else could it be?

763
01:05:28,747 --> 01:05:31,999
There is a suitcase
we have not searched.

764
01:05:33,247 --> 01:05:34,247
Mine.

765
01:05:39,038 --> 01:05:41,290
The murderer scorns me.

766
01:05:41,458 --> 01:05:46,414
Well. That's his first mistake.
And like night comes after day...

767
01:05:46,582 --> 01:05:48,622
Pardon, mademoiselle.

768
01:05:52,374 --> 01:05:56,038
It is not mine.
I told you about the conductor.

769
01:05:56,206 --> 01:05:57,790
Why do it?
- No.

770
01:05:57,958 --> 01:06:01,498
<i>That's why your coupon is the
perfect place for you  Voilà,</i>

771
01:06:01,666 --> 01:06:09,538
And if you have a conductor
uniform, why not a conductor's key?

772
01:06:09,706 --> 01:06:13,538
Now we know how the killer
came through the locked doors.

773
01:06:17,830 --> 01:06:19,582
Bourbon.
- MacQueen.

774
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,082
What are we looking for now?

775
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:28,666
MacQueen had an account of all
Ratchett's trades. Where is it?

776
01:06:32,206 --> 01:06:33,998
Poirot?

777
01:06:35,582 --> 01:06:37,790
Bouc, keep everyone inside!

778
01:06:39,122 --> 01:06:41,458
Stop monsieur!

779
01:06:50,122 --> 01:06:52,250
Monsieur!

780
01:07:15,582 --> 01:07:18,250
Monsieur! Stay there!

781
01:07:29,914 --> 01:07:32,122
Thank you very much, gentlemen. Thanks.

782
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:44,330
So that was MacQueen?
Have you caught the killer?

783
01:07:44,498 --> 01:07:48,082
<i>Pardonnez-moi, madame.
- Where could he?</i>

784
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,498
<i>I did not kill him!
- They wanted to burn the accounts.</i>

785
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:54,750
However, it can still be read. The cashier
does not vote because you stole from him.

786
01:07:54,914 --> 01:07:59,830
That's clean...
What is it called in English? Mug?

787
01:07:59,998 --> 01:08:02,250
Dung.
- Milk! It's the pure bug!

788
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:06,038
They stole from him!
They thought it would be discovered.

789
01:08:06,206 --> 01:08:09,874
That's why you killed him!
- Yes.

790
01:08:10,666 --> 01:08:14,082
Yes it's true. I stole from him.

791
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,414
Thousands.

792
01:08:16,582 --> 01:08:19,250
I knew that his money was
not honestly earned.

793
01:08:19,458 --> 01:08:22,706
What did it mean if I took a little myself?

794
01:08:22,874 --> 01:08:25,790
But let me ask you something.

795
01:08:25,958 --> 01:08:31,122
Why should I beat my own gold calf?
I did not.

796
01:08:31,250 --> 01:08:34,874
I did not kill him.
- He did not.

797
01:08:35,790 --> 01:08:39,914
I assume his alibi is that we drank
together until late at night. It suits.

798
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:43,750
I saw him with some whiskey and said
something about bad American spirits.

799
01:08:43,914 --> 01:08:46,958
He offered me a blessing so I could
change attitude. And then one more.

800
01:08:47,122 --> 01:08:49,914
We discussed policies.
He had some...

801
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:54,206
naive attitudes toward Stalin,
but he has a sense of spirits.

802
01:08:58,330 --> 01:09:00,250
Can we talk together, Monsieur?

803
01:09:00,414 --> 01:09:04,538
They were with him all night?
"We smoke and talked together for a little while in two, yes.

804
01:09:04,706 --> 01:09:09,038
What friends? He with cigarettes and you...
They are the only on board who smoke pipes.

805
01:09:09,206 --> 01:09:12,250
Can I see your pipe and tobacco?
- Of course.

806
01:09:12,458 --> 01:09:18,122
And you, Dr. Arbuthnot, They traveled from India?
- Do you hear me now?

807
01:09:18,250 --> 01:09:21,250
Were you at Ratchett before he was murdered?
- Certainly not.

808
01:09:21,414 --> 01:09:23,374
But it's one of your
piber sensors, right?

809
01:09:23,538 --> 01:09:27,166
If you found it at the
dead, then stay elsewhere.

810
01:09:27,330 --> 01:09:29,958
I am a doctor. I heal people.
I do not harm them.

811
01:09:30,122 --> 01:09:33,250
They must have worked
hard to become a doctor.

812
01:09:33,458 --> 01:09:36,874
Not many of your races get it.

813
01:09:37,958 --> 01:09:42,082
Middlesex Medical College allows one
per year. I had the honor in 24.

814
01:09:43,498 --> 01:09:45,958
I was shooting when
I was in service.

815
01:09:46,122 --> 01:09:49,374
Sharpshooter.
I have saved some officers.

816
01:09:49,538 --> 01:09:51,958
The more grateful of them
recognized my abilities.

817
01:09:52,122 --> 01:09:55,538
They supported me in my education.
I see their generosity as a debt.

818
01:09:55,706 --> 01:09:57,874
Did you know a Colonel Armstrong?

819
01:09:58,038 --> 01:10:00,958
I may have known two or
three, called Armstrong.

820
01:10:01,122 --> 01:10:04,330
Tommy in the 60th. Selby Armstrong.
- Colonel John Armstrong.

821
01:10:04,498 --> 01:10:08,958
He had an American wife and his
children were kidnapped and killed.

822
01:10:11,206 --> 01:10:14,458
I have never met him.
- When did you meet Debenham?

823
01:10:14,622 --> 01:10:17,750
We met on board a train convoy
from Kirkuk to Nissibin.

824
01:10:17,914 --> 01:10:22,250
<i>She says something else
and she has  Excusez-moi.</i>

825
01:10:22,458 --> 01:10:24,914
Mary is a nice lady.

826
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:29,790
I can say good to her.
- As you did it for MacQueen?

827
01:10:32,914 --> 01:10:34,914
They will not listen to reason.
- Never.

828
01:10:36,622 --> 01:10:40,206
They are lucky. The good doctor insists
that he does not let you down.

829
01:10:40,374 --> 01:10:43,166
Can you see? I can not have done that.
- Yes, you can.

830
01:10:43,330 --> 01:10:48,166
Ratchett drank sleepers every night.
They could easily have added Veronal.

831
01:10:48,330 --> 01:10:51,750
They could have done the same with
one of the doctor's many drinks.

832
01:10:51,914 --> 01:10:54,166
Why?
- We have determined your motivation.

833
01:10:54,330 --> 01:11:00,874
Can I suggest another?
Another reason. A more personal reason.

834
01:11:01,038 --> 01:11:07,038
"Attorney of education, not by nature."
Why did you read the law?

835
01:11:08,250 --> 01:11:14,082
Was it to add a tall,
but demanding father, -

836
01:11:15,082 --> 01:11:20,706
- who had been very
successful in this field -

837
01:11:20,874 --> 01:11:24,874
- and then lost its position?

838
01:11:25,998 --> 01:11:29,082
There was a recognized
MacQueen, right?

839
01:11:29,250 --> 01:11:32,874
The Public Prosecutor of New Jersey, -

840
01:11:33,038 --> 01:11:38,250
- who was responsible for the Armstrong case.

841
01:11:41,206 --> 01:11:43,582
They had no suspects.

842
01:11:44,582 --> 01:11:49,458
My father was pushed to go
for a poor French woman, -

843
01:11:49,622 --> 01:11:53,622
- a maid with a weak alibi, Susanne.

844
01:11:55,414 --> 01:11:57,622
All his case rested upon her.

845
01:11:58,830 --> 01:12:01,750
She killed herself.

846
01:12:01,914 --> 01:12:04,582
She was innocent.

847
01:12:04,750 --> 01:12:10,374
As the evidence led to Cassetti, he
was long over all the mountains.

848
01:12:11,666 --> 01:12:14,250
They threw themselves over
my father like dingy wolves.

849
01:12:16,830 --> 01:12:18,830
I could do nothing for him.

850
01:12:18,998 --> 01:12:22,250
And yet you claim you did not
know that Ratchett was Cassetti?

851
01:12:22,458 --> 01:12:25,582
No. No.
But you found him.

852
01:12:25,750 --> 01:12:28,706
No.
- They found him and dragged him.

853
01:12:28,874 --> 01:12:33,414
They would cover your father's
debt and finally get your revenge.

854
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:37,038
No no no.
No, that's how it was

855
01:12:37,206 --> 01:12:40,082
That's not how it was. It's not like that...

856
01:12:43,414 --> 01:12:47,458
Someone kicked the door.
Layed my hand over my face.

857
01:12:49,250 --> 01:12:51,166
It's going out now.

858
01:12:56,998 --> 01:13:00,122
I would like my bag.
It's in my coup.

859
01:13:01,038 --> 01:13:04,250
There are no fingerprints on it.
The killer wanted to kill the murder weapon.

860
01:13:04,374 --> 01:13:05,958
There.

861
01:13:14,706 --> 01:13:19,206
The knife did not hit a lung or artery.
She is lucky to be alive.

862
01:13:19,374 --> 01:13:24,458
That's all of you. What a genius.
Why have you not clarified the matter?

863
01:13:24,830 --> 01:13:28,250
Give him a little more time.
- So...

864
01:13:28,414 --> 01:13:32,458
I can not give much more.
I have no more blood left.

865
01:13:32,622 --> 01:13:37,498
They accuse MacQueen, and the real
killer is right here. It's one of you.

866
01:13:39,750 --> 01:13:42,250
I do not know who you are.
I did not say anything.

867
01:13:42,458 --> 01:13:45,458
Leave me alone.
- Play something.

868
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:49,374
My friends, the track is cleared tomorrow.
Please go to your coupons.

869
01:13:49,538 --> 01:13:52,914
I'm sleeping here where everyone
can see me and I can see everyone.

870
01:13:53,082 --> 01:13:57,538
You should do the same. Save on the heat.
Find security by being in sight.

871
01:13:57,706 --> 01:14:00,582
A murderer never hesitates to murder again.

872
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:07,622
I give the Andrenyi couple the same
message, diplomatic immunity or not.

873
01:14:12,458 --> 01:14:15,038
With leave I will look into your passport.

874
01:14:20,582 --> 01:14:22,622
You know, I have to talk to her.

875
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:25,622
There is a fat spot on their wife's name.
You must look at that.

876
01:14:25,790 --> 01:14:27,790
Elena is not well.

877
01:14:28,250 --> 01:14:32,498
Add me or the Yugoslav police will
be notified and you will arrest...

878
01:14:32,666 --> 01:14:34,790
How dare you
- My dear.

879
01:14:36,498 --> 01:14:38,414
My dear.

880
01:14:43,790 --> 01:14:46,666
They look special, Monsieur Poirot.

881
01:14:46,830 --> 01:14:49,122
Does all the detectives look unusual?

882
01:14:51,790 --> 01:14:55,082
<i>Sorry, I had to wake you
up,  Madame la Comtesse.</i>

883
01:14:56,706 --> 01:15:00,706
I'm always awake at night.
I sleep a day.

884
01:15:00,874 --> 01:15:04,998
Some fear the dark, but I
can not keep the light out.

885
01:15:05,166 --> 01:15:09,082
They are always influenced by...
- Veronal.

886
01:15:09,250 --> 01:15:11,790
Veronal. Veronal.

887
01:15:11,958 --> 01:15:13,914
I take huge amounts of it.

888
01:15:16,706 --> 01:15:20,998
It does not help lying, dear.
He has examined us.

889
01:15:22,914 --> 01:15:25,330
I can not go outside without.

890
01:15:26,414 --> 01:15:28,622
I can not sleep without.

891
01:15:30,458 --> 01:15:33,250
I take it to dampen my fear.

892
01:15:38,082 --> 01:15:40,414
What are you afraid of?

893
01:15:42,666 --> 01:15:44,830
Everything.

894
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:54,750
In your passport is your maiden
name, Goldenberg. They are Jewish?

895
01:15:54,914 --> 01:15:57,458
Not so Jewish.
My middle name is not Maria.

896
01:15:57,622 --> 01:16:01,414
And are you dancing like your husband?
- No, not like my husband.

897
01:16:01,582 --> 01:16:03,622
<i>Corps de Ballet.</i>

898
01:16:03,790 --> 01:16:09,082
He is a counsel of God, and I have
worked hard enough to be sufficient.

899
01:16:12,250 --> 01:16:18,122
Excuse me. I have to lay back.
Is that your only robe?

900
01:16:22,166 --> 01:16:26,166
No, I have one more. Of yellow chiffon.

901
01:16:27,498 --> 01:16:31,250
I like talking with detectives.
You never know what they're asking for.

902
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:36,582
I am particularly good at capitals.
My governor was strict for geography.

903
01:16:38,414 --> 01:16:44,458
Are you satisfied?
- Yes, always when I reveal a liar.

904
01:16:44,622 --> 01:16:48,250
Your name is not Elena.
It's Helena.

905
01:16:48,414 --> 01:16:51,830
Despite your clumsy attempt to
change this and your luggage.

906
01:16:53,538 --> 01:16:56,250
My husband heard of a proof.

907
01:16:56,414 --> 01:17:00,498
A handkerchief embroidered with an H,
and my H should not be mixed into it.

908
01:17:00,666 --> 01:17:04,082
So we changed it on the
luggage and in the passport.

909
01:17:04,250 --> 01:17:06,582
It's not illegal to
stay out of trouble.

910
01:17:06,750 --> 01:17:08,458
Nevertheless, the problems are here.

911
01:17:08,622 --> 01:17:12,498
A particular detail of the Armstrong
tragedy, which is the core of this case,

912
01:17:12,666 --> 01:17:16,206
- is how many people
were hurt by it.

913
01:17:16,374 --> 01:17:18,166
Little sister.

914
01:17:18,330 --> 01:17:23,582
The mother, who was an actress
with the artist Linda Arden.

915
01:17:23,750 --> 01:17:27,458
<i>She was also Jewish too.</i>

916
01:17:27,622 --> 01:17:34,250
And who usually takes an artist name?
Is it going too far to believe?

917
01:17:34,414 --> 01:17:37,414
- that her maiden name was Goldenberg?

918
01:17:38,622 --> 01:17:43,166
Especially when we find a young
woman of about the same age -

919
01:17:43,330 --> 01:17:46,082
- like her surviving daughter, -

920
01:17:46,250 --> 01:17:48,538
- who lives in fear?

921
01:17:49,206 --> 01:17:52,250
Sonia Armstrong's sister.

922
01:17:54,122 --> 01:17:55,914
Out!

923
01:17:59,914 --> 01:18:03,414
I heard an alarm and came running.
Right on time, right?

924
01:18:03,582 --> 01:18:06,458
You must think that the Count and
the Countess are the killers.

925
01:18:06,622 --> 01:18:09,250
The Count protects her.
Countess is harmless.

926
01:18:09,458 --> 01:18:11,706
And you can keep up with the comedy game.

927
01:18:13,498 --> 01:18:16,750
They are neither Austrian,
German nor Professor.

928
01:18:17,458 --> 01:18:21,458
But that's a good imitation.
Have you based it on one you know?

929
01:18:26,830 --> 01:18:30,750
One of the local butchers where
I grew up were hot dogs.

930
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:33,750
A good man with a fantastic accent.

931
01:18:37,414 --> 01:18:40,538
What was it?
- They said "Tor-ino".

932
01:18:40,706 --> 01:18:44,250
They pressed the wrong
syllable for a true teuton.

933
01:18:44,790 --> 01:18:46,498
"Two-rino."

934
01:18:49,750 --> 01:18:54,082
They are sharp, I can give them.

935
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:04,414
Mr. Professor Gerhard
Hardman is my tire name.

936
01:19:04,582 --> 01:19:10,166
Sorry for the outcome of colored people.
I am even half smovs.

937
01:19:10,330 --> 01:19:13,330
Cyrus Bethman Hardman.

938
01:19:15,122 --> 01:19:18,582
They are Pinkerton detectives?
- Through 30 years.

939
01:19:18,750 --> 01:19:21,706
I was in Istanbul when the
headquarters telegraphed me.

940
01:19:21,874 --> 01:19:25,830
Ratchett asked to be monitored.
He paid triple.

941
01:19:25,998 --> 01:19:27,998
Fortunately, I was close to.

942
01:19:33,538 --> 01:19:38,374
He said that I should look for a
small, dark man with a light voice.

943
01:19:39,038 --> 01:19:43,582
I watched the common room all
night with the door on my hug.

944
01:19:43,750 --> 01:19:47,414
Any criminals would
pass by me first.

945
01:19:48,414 --> 01:19:50,038
I'd like to swear.

946
01:19:50,206 --> 01:19:55,166
Will you also swear on your 30th
birthday as a Pinkerton detective?

947
01:19:55,330 --> 01:20:00,538
- Do you want to lie to me again and deny
that you used to be a police officer?

948
01:20:00,706 --> 01:20:04,122
Your gun, the patterned
grip, the blue steel.

949
01:20:04,250 --> 01:20:07,374
A Police Positive Model.

950
01:20:07,538 --> 01:20:10,122
Year 1927.

951
01:20:10,250 --> 01:20:13,582
It seems as though there is no
end to the lies I'm offered.

952
01:20:15,414 --> 01:20:18,166
They can leave your
gun here, professor.

953
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:40,998
From his position in the cabin -

954
01:20:42,874 --> 01:20:46,082
- could he not have overlooked it

955
01:20:48,206 --> 01:20:51,914
Unless Ratchett's door was open.

956
01:20:52,082 --> 01:20:55,998
Pilar Estravados claims
that she opened it.

957
01:20:56,166 --> 01:21:02,038
In that case, someone may have been
there without being seen by him.

958
01:21:08,038 --> 01:21:10,122
My dear Katherine.

959
01:21:11,082 --> 01:21:13,622
This is an abominable crime.

960
01:21:13,790 --> 01:21:16,998
And I'm stuck, Katherine.

961
01:21:20,038 --> 01:21:22,666
I can not find the crack in the wall.

962
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:26,874
Why is there one I can not spot?

963
01:21:31,706 --> 01:21:34,374
I have always been...

964
01:21:34,538 --> 01:21:37,330
so sure.

965
01:21:37,498 --> 01:21:39,250
For sure.

966
01:21:41,458 --> 01:21:45,666
But now I'm totally humble and
I say, like a little child:

967
01:21:48,206 --> 01:21:50,166
I do not know.

968
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,790
I'm afraid, Katherine.

969
01:22:11,458 --> 01:22:15,914
Sorry. It is dangerous to be on board
while the locomotive is on track.

970
01:22:16,082 --> 01:22:17,538
We have to wait in the tunnel.

971
01:22:17,706 --> 01:22:20,290
Where do they lead the dogs?
- They are fine.

972
01:22:20,458 --> 01:22:23,082
It does not work.
- They get a little fresh air.

973
01:22:23,250 --> 01:22:25,538
No, it does not matter.

974
01:22:26,498 --> 01:22:30,166
Here is dog breed.
- Are we stuck here?

975
01:22:30,330 --> 01:22:33,706
They asked for me?
Another question?

976
01:22:33,874 --> 01:22:36,330
No, I enjoy your company.

977
01:22:36,498 --> 01:22:39,082
<i>Merci,</i>

978
01:22:40,706 --> 01:22:45,374
I have ten unanswered questions, and
the train is driving again soon.

979
01:22:45,538 --> 01:22:47,750
They have a bright head, -

980
01:22:47,914 --> 01:22:51,666
- and I thought you might be able to help.

981
01:22:56,206 --> 01:22:59,250
"Handkerchief. Piberenseren."

982
01:22:59,458 --> 01:23:03,122
"The red kimono. Uniforms."

983
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:05,498
"Time of the clock."

984
01:23:05,666 --> 01:23:09,498
"Was he murdered at that time?
Before? Later?"

985
01:23:09,666 --> 01:23:13,958
"By one or more people?
Which one of them?"

986
01:23:16,998 --> 01:23:20,082
Sorry, I can not help you.

987
01:23:20,250 --> 01:23:22,914
<i>Merci.</i>

988
01:23:23,082 --> 01:23:28,166
Perhaps there is a 11 question that
can give answers to the others.

989
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:30,666
Maybe.

990
01:23:30,830 --> 01:23:34,750
I can easily point out accusing
the Countess Andrenyi.

991
01:23:34,914 --> 01:23:37,330
She is Sonia Armstrong's sister.

992
01:23:37,498 --> 01:23:40,706
Are you sure?
- Yes. I think she's innocent.

993
01:23:40,874 --> 01:23:45,038
Maybe. But so many on
board have lied to me.

994
01:23:45,206 --> 01:23:47,666
They also lied to me without hassle.
- Me?

995
01:23:47,830 --> 01:23:52,038
They said you've never been to America,
but when the tragedy took place,

996
01:23:52,206 --> 01:23:56,958
were you at Armstrong's governor for
your daughter? You know that yourself.

997
01:23:57,122 --> 01:24:02,750
I have to make an appearance. One who is
detained in a murder case, nobody will be right.

998
01:24:02,914 --> 01:24:05,666
Miss Debenham, you planned
the murder of Ratchett.

999
01:24:05,830 --> 01:24:07,914
And then you called the Countess.

1000
01:24:08,082 --> 01:24:11,122
If she saw him dead, the old
Helena might come back.

1001
01:24:11,250 --> 01:24:13,414
Their coupons did not fall asleep.

1002
01:24:13,582 --> 01:24:15,874
They anesthetized her, but
she just got a headache.

1003
01:24:16,038 --> 01:24:18,874
She asked for an aspirin while the
conductor was at the station.

1004
01:24:19,038 --> 01:24:22,538
The coast was finally ready and you
could come to Ratchett unseen.

1005
01:24:22,706 --> 01:24:25,830
The beloved Daisy Armstrong.
They murdered Cassetti.

1006
01:24:28,914 --> 01:24:32,458
Cassetti was a pig.
He deserved to die.

1007
01:24:41,122 --> 01:24:43,206
She did not kill him.

1008
01:24:45,082 --> 01:24:47,458
I did that.

1009
01:24:51,374 --> 01:24:53,622
Get out, Mary.

1010
01:24:53,790 --> 01:24:56,998
You must not blame for
what I did on my own.

1011
01:25:02,538 --> 01:25:05,038
Come on, Mary.

1012
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:11,038
John Armstrong was my best friend.
My commanding authority.

1013
01:25:12,998 --> 01:25:15,330
He believed in me.

1014
01:25:15,498 --> 01:25:18,914
He made me read medicine.
Gave me a future.

1015
01:25:20,122 --> 01:25:22,414
Cassetti crushed him.

1016
01:25:24,622 --> 01:25:26,790
Stumbled upon grief, I found Mary.

1017
01:25:28,458 --> 01:25:30,958
And then I found Ratchett.

1018
01:25:32,206 --> 01:25:36,498
We would leave him to the police.
That's what you heard.

1019
01:25:37,498 --> 01:25:40,082
But when I saw his face,

1020
01:25:41,998 --> 01:25:44,290
- I knew he did not
deserve a lawsuit.

1021
01:25:44,706 --> 01:25:47,958
Then you anesthetized MacQueen.

1022
01:25:48,122 --> 01:25:53,330
They asked the clock so that
they could lie about the dead.

1023
01:25:53,498 --> 01:25:57,374
I could not let Mary blame.
Or MacQueen.

1024
01:25:58,874 --> 01:26:02,250
I alone must be fined for my sins.

1025
01:26:02,914 --> 01:26:06,250
I'm a soldier.
A soldier kills to protect others.

1026
01:26:07,250 --> 01:26:10,206
And now, mr. Poirot, I have to
protect myself against you.

1027
01:26:20,622 --> 01:26:23,458
Why are you not dead yet?

1028
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:30,250
Poirot?

1029
01:26:44,706 --> 01:26:47,250
Stop, gentlemen!

1030
01:26:47,414 --> 01:26:50,498
We must have all the
passengers on board again.

1031
01:26:51,750 --> 01:26:56,122
You keep from the train, -

1032
01:26:57,706 --> 01:27:00,538
- until I say you will come.

1033
01:27:18,790 --> 01:27:21,206
You lie

1034
01:27:21,374 --> 01:27:23,582
- and you think nobody discovers it.

1035
01:27:24,330 --> 01:27:27,122
But there are two who discover it.

1036
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,830
Yes, two.

1037
01:27:29,998 --> 01:27:32,498
Your god

1038
01:27:32,666 --> 01:27:34,998
And Hercule Poirot.

1039
01:27:38,830 --> 01:27:41,998
Now this case must be clarified.

1040
01:28:03,038 --> 01:28:06,958
Dr. Arbuthnot asked me
why I'm not dead yet.

1041
01:28:08,082 --> 01:28:10,790
Of course, he knew the answer himself.

1042
01:28:10,958 --> 01:28:13,666
A sharp shooter that can not
kill at a short distance?

1043
01:28:15,414 --> 01:28:19,082
Your shot was not a mistake.
It was surgery.

1044
01:28:19,250 --> 01:28:22,458
You could not kill me because
you're not a killer.

1045
01:28:23,458 --> 01:28:25,666
It's none of you.

1046
01:28:26,622 --> 01:28:29,122
And yet one of you must be.

1047
01:28:31,998 --> 01:28:34,458
There are two possible
solutions in this case.

1048
01:28:34,582 --> 01:28:40,622
One is difficult because it's the same with
most, but not all the facts, and one is...

1049
01:28:40,790 --> 01:28:43,250
complex.

1050
01:28:43,414 --> 01:28:47,250
The first solution.
Ratchett had enemies.

1051
01:28:47,458 --> 01:28:50,330
A mafioso sneaks aboard
the train in Vinkovci, -

1052
01:28:50,498 --> 01:28:52,830
- while MacQueen and
Arbuthnot draw fresh air.

1053
01:28:52,998 --> 01:28:55,998
Equipped with a uniform and
key, he conceals Ratchett.

1054
01:28:56,166 --> 01:28:59,250
He leaves the train through Mrs.
Hubbard's coup and fleeing.

1055
01:28:59,458 --> 01:29:01,166
No.

1056
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:04,206
No no no. It does not work.

1057
01:29:04,874 --> 01:29:08,874
Why hide the uniform?
Who then stunned Ratchett?

1058
01:29:09,038 --> 01:29:13,206
Or whipped Mrs. Hubbard?
God damn!

1059
01:29:14,374 --> 01:29:17,330
So who benefits from this?

1060
01:29:17,498 --> 01:29:21,250
The crime is the murder of a killer.

1061
01:29:21,830 --> 01:29:24,498
The advantage may be...

1062
01:29:24,666 --> 01:29:28,122
spiritual. That one's suffering is relieved.

1063
01:29:29,166 --> 01:29:33,750
To dampen a shouting voice in
the head that prevents sleep.

1064
01:29:40,166 --> 01:29:42,582
There is a killer among us.

1065
01:29:43,998 --> 01:29:46,250
Reach.

1066
01:29:46,458 --> 01:29:50,122
We have dr. Arbuthnot, Colonel
Armstrong's devoted friend.

1067
01:29:51,498 --> 01:29:54,706
He meets and finds comfort in the
governor Mary Debenham's company, -

1068
01:29:54,874 --> 01:29:57,582
- almost like a mother
for the little girl.

1069
01:29:57,750 --> 01:30:02,498
And so close to Mrs.
Armstrong's little sister, -

1070
01:30:02,666 --> 01:30:09,498
- Helena Goldenberg, married to a
strong, angry and violent man.

1071
01:30:09,874 --> 01:30:13,790
We also travel with Daisy's godmother, -

1072
01:30:13,958 --> 01:30:16,790
- who is the owner of -

1073
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:22,122
- the embroidered handkerchief that was
found at the scene of the crime scene.

1074
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:28,706
The letter H in the Russian
alphabet is of course stated as N.

1075
01:30:28,874 --> 01:30:34,122
Natalia Dragomiroff. And her devoted
maid who makes so good food?

1076
01:30:34,250 --> 01:30:37,958
What was she before she became a maid?
Armstrong family's cheeky girl.

1077
01:30:38,914 --> 01:30:42,038
But we are not done yet.

1078
01:30:42,498 --> 01:30:47,790
Daisy's nurse whose religion was
guilty of letting her patient -

1079
01:30:47,958 --> 01:30:49,914
- be abducted It was you.

1080
01:30:50,082 --> 01:30:54,250
<i>They stayed with her the night that
Ratchett crept into the window.</i>

1081
01:30:54,414 --> 01:30:57,082
Have you been drinking a glass
of wine too much that evening?

1082
01:30:57,250 --> 01:31:00,750
Have you blamed yourself for
not being able to stop him?

1083
01:31:00,914 --> 01:31:05,958
She knew nothing but
caring and love until...

1084
01:31:09,498 --> 01:31:11,582
Until I...

1085
01:31:12,414 --> 01:31:18,498
They do not need to tell me. I was Colonel
Armstrong's waiter during the war.

1086
01:31:19,250 --> 01:31:22,622
And later I was his
valet in New York.

1087
01:31:23,830 --> 01:31:26,582
Better man God has not created.

1088
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:28,790
Does his driver agree?

1089
01:31:28,958 --> 01:31:32,666
A loan, guaranteed by Armstrong, was the
beginning of his automobile empire.

1090
01:31:32,830 --> 01:31:35,414
He is indebted to him forever.
Who else?

1091
01:31:35,582 --> 01:31:38,414
What about the Pinkerton
detective, a former officer,

1092
01:31:38,582 --> 01:31:40,790
- Who worked with the Armstrong case?

1093
01:31:40,958 --> 01:31:46,206
And he relates to one, because there is yet
another sacrifice we have not been honored.

1094
01:31:46,374 --> 01:31:50,206
They fell in love with you in the maid
before being accused of a false basis.

1095
01:31:50,374 --> 01:31:54,082
<i>They said when you saw righteousness
stomped under your feet,</i>

1096
01:31:54,250 --> 01:31:57,166
<i>- when Macquarie's father
insisted she should be arrested.</i>

1097
01:31:57,330 --> 01:31:59,666
When she took her own life.

1098
01:31:59,830 --> 01:32:01,958
No! No no!

1099
01:32:03,082 --> 01:32:06,166
Susanne was a gentle creature.

1100
01:32:06,330 --> 01:32:08,414
And she fell for me.

1101
01:32:09,250 --> 01:32:13,166
Old and grayish.
I said she could find a better man.

1102
01:32:15,374 --> 01:32:17,330
But there she was.

1103
01:32:17,498 --> 01:32:20,830
Always punctual to all our attendance meetings.

1104
01:32:22,206 --> 01:32:26,706
Why is the train so full in the winter?
Why the inconsistent stabbing years?

1105
01:32:26,874 --> 01:32:29,998
Why the overwhelming amount of tracks?
Why...?

1106
01:32:31,582 --> 01:32:33,790
Why the conductor?

1107
01:32:34,874 --> 01:32:37,414
Pierre Michel from Avignon, -

1108
01:32:38,498 --> 01:32:41,122
- who lost his sister, -

1109
01:32:41,374 --> 01:32:43,914
- the accused maid, -

1110
01:32:44,082 --> 01:32:46,458
- Susanne Michel.

1111
01:32:50,330 --> 01:32:55,458
Only one can claim to have
lost more than any of you.

1112
01:32:55,622 --> 01:32:58,498
The poor Linda Arden, -

1113
01:32:58,666 --> 01:33:00,750
- Sonia's mother, -

1114
01:33:00,914 --> 01:33:03,122
grandma of daisy

1115
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:05,458
- which has retired, -

1116
01:33:06,038 --> 01:33:09,538
- but ready for one last performance.

1117
01:33:30,538 --> 01:33:33,498
They are a very clever man.

1118
01:33:36,250 --> 01:33:39,706
A murder should only have one victim.

1119
01:33:39,874 --> 01:33:42,874
When Ratchett kills Daisy Armstrong, -

1120
01:33:43,038 --> 01:33:48,166
- destroyed, changed, ending
the life of a group of people.

1121
01:33:48,330 --> 01:33:51,414
They demand justice!

1122
01:33:51,582 --> 01:33:55,038
Among all these wounded souls
we must seek the answer.

1123
01:33:55,206 --> 01:33:58,206
Who of them is the killer?

1124
01:33:58,374 --> 01:34:02,206
Who led the knife? The answer is...

1125
01:34:07,374 --> 01:34:10,958
None of you can have
done it on your own.

1126
01:34:11,122 --> 01:34:15,790
Neither one single pair.
It can only be done...

1127
01:34:16,330 --> 01:34:20,330
of all of you. Together.

1128
01:34:23,374 --> 01:34:25,998
<i>Together.</i>

1129
01:34:26,166 --> 01:34:28,206
<i>When the avalanche changes everything, -</i>

1130
01:34:28,374 --> 01:34:32,122
<i>- like the detective, the
plan has to be changed.</i>

1131
01:34:32,250 --> 01:34:34,790
<i>Kimono, uniforms.</i>

1132
01:34:34,958 --> 01:34:38,374
<i>An impressive improvisation.
The doctor who can hurt without killing.</i>

1133
01:34:38,538 --> 01:34:40,498
<i>Everyone has a role to play.</i>

1134
01:34:40,666 --> 01:34:42,038
Do it.

1135
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:45,166
<i>That was my plan.</i>

1136
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:47,790
I recruited them.

1137
01:34:47,958 --> 01:34:50,414
I got Hardman to track Cassetti.

1138
01:34:50,582 --> 01:34:53,958
I got MacQueen to work for
him and then Masterman.

1139
01:34:55,458 --> 01:34:58,498
MacQueen could arrange the trip to
the day that Michel had guarded.

1140
01:36:40,250 --> 01:36:42,250
Mr. Ratchett?

1141
01:36:44,082 --> 01:36:45,998
There is nothing.

1142
01:36:46,166 --> 01:36:48,374
Fine. Good night.

1143
01:36:49,582 --> 01:36:52,038
<i>And then it is done.</i>

1144
01:36:52,206 --> 01:36:54,830
<i>For the innocent's death.</i>

1145
01:36:54,958 --> 01:36:57,790
<i>A life for a life.</i>

1146
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:02,790
Revenge.

1147
01:37:02,958 --> 01:37:07,582
No one but me should be hanged for this.
That was my plan!

1148
01:37:08,582 --> 01:37:11,750
Tell the police that I was alone.

1149
01:37:11,914 --> 01:37:14,914
There's no life left in me anymore.

1150
01:37:15,082 --> 01:37:18,082
They have a chance now.

1151
01:37:18,250 --> 01:37:20,914
Helena, I hope, have a cha...

1152
01:37:22,666 --> 01:37:24,706
have a chance now.

1153
01:37:24,874 --> 01:37:27,458
They can...

1154
01:37:27,622 --> 01:37:29,458
live.

1155
01:37:29,958 --> 01:37:33,622
Find the joy somewhere.

1156
01:37:35,622 --> 01:37:37,958
Leave it here with me.

1157
01:37:41,330 --> 01:37:43,250
They are not murderers.

1158
01:37:44,830 --> 01:37:47,122
They are good people.

1159
01:37:48,250 --> 01:37:50,666
They can be good again.

1160
01:37:54,538 --> 01:37:58,166
It was right and there was the clock.

1161
01:37:58,414 --> 01:38:00,414
And now there are you.

1162
01:38:04,374 --> 01:38:06,666
I can not trap them.

1163
01:38:07,830 --> 01:38:09,706
You have to decide.

1164
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:14,166
If you want to avoid being
punished for your crime,

1165
01:38:15,622 --> 01:38:18,038
Then you must commit one more.

1166
01:38:19,706 --> 01:38:21,790
I will not stop you.

1167
01:38:24,458 --> 01:38:26,998
You can not let them kill you.

1168
01:38:27,330 --> 01:38:32,750
You leave my body to the lake,
and you leave the station.

1169
01:38:33,622 --> 01:38:35,750
You must make me silent.

1170
01:38:35,914 --> 01:38:38,122
Bouc can lie.

1171
01:38:38,250 --> 01:38:40,458
I can not.

1172
01:38:44,082 --> 01:38:48,038
Do it! One of you!

1173
01:38:48,206 --> 01:38:52,914
Do not.
- I died with Daisy.

1174
01:38:54,458 --> 01:38:56,458
No!

1175
01:39:38,498 --> 01:39:41,250
They said your role was
to provide justice.

1176
01:39:41,414 --> 01:39:43,830
What is fair here?

1177
01:39:46,706 --> 01:39:49,166
Sometimes the laws of man do not propose.

1178
01:39:51,038 --> 01:39:53,166
Where is the conscience?

1179
01:39:55,622 --> 01:39:58,414
It was buried with Daisy.

1180
01:42:25,207 --> 01:42:28,623
<i>My dear Colonel Armstrong.</i>

1181
01:42:29,623 --> 01:42:32,791
<i>Finally, I can answer your letter,</i>

1182
01:42:32,955 --> 01:42:38,539
<i>- at least with my thoughts
and with a sense of</i>

1183
01:42:38,707 --> 01:42:42,163
<i>- Somewhere, you can hear me.</i>

1184
01:42:43,207 --> 01:42:47,247
<i>I have now found the truth
in this case and it is...</i>

1185
01:42:47,415 --> 01:42:50,083
<i>extremely disturbing.</i>

1186
01:42:51,083 --> 01:42:54,791
<i>I've seen broken human souls.</i>

1187
01:42:54,999 --> 01:43:00,039
<i>So amazing many broken lives,
so much pain and anger, -</i>

1188
01:43:00,207 --> 01:43:04,083
<i>- revealing the toxicity of the deep sorrow,</i>

1189
01:43:04,291 --> 01:43:07,747
<i>- until one crime became to many.</i>

1190
01:43:09,371 --> 01:43:15,247
<i>I have always wanted to believe
that man is rational and civilized.</i>

1191
01:43:15,415 --> 01:43:18,791
<i>My existence is dependent
on this confidence -</i>

1192
01:43:18,955 --> 01:43:24,291
<i>- order and method and
the small gray cells.</i>

1193
01:43:25,415 --> 01:43:28,955
<i>But now, maybe, you're asking me...</i>

1194
01:43:29,083 --> 01:43:31,999
<i>instead of listening...</i>

1195
01:43:32,163 --> 01:43:34,371
<i>to my heart</i>

1196
01:43:40,371 --> 01:43:43,371
Ladies and gentlemen.

1197
01:43:43,539 --> 01:43:47,747
In this case, I have understood
that the scales of justice -

1198
01:43:47,915 --> 01:43:50,623
- can not always be in equilibrium

1199
01:43:51,831 --> 01:43:54,247
And I have to learn, for once,

1200
01:43:54,415 --> 01:43:57,539
- to live with the imbalance

1201
01:43:59,207 --> 01:44:01,539
There are no killers here.

1202
01:44:01,707 --> 01:44:05,083
Only people who have earned an
opportunity to wound the wounds.

1203
01:44:06,083 --> 01:44:08,915
The police have accepted my first
solution to the mystery, -

1204
01:44:09,083 --> 01:44:12,163
- The single assassin
who slept away.

1205
01:44:12,999 --> 01:44:16,707
I'm leaving this train now to
take care of the formalities.

1206
01:44:17,791 --> 01:44:20,999
You can do freely as it pleases you.

1207
01:44:21,163 --> 01:44:23,999
And you must find peace with this here.

1208
01:44:26,415 --> 01:44:28,539
May we all do it.

1209
01:44:43,791 --> 01:44:49,915
Good day. I'm looking for a mr. Poirot.
There is need for him.

1210
01:44:51,083 --> 01:44:53,291
He is on vacation.

1211
01:44:55,415 --> 01:44:57,455
Is that Kassner case again?

1212
01:44:57,623 --> 01:45:00,083
No, it's far worse.

1213
01:45:00,247 --> 01:45:05,955
I will bring him directly to Egypt.
A murder has been committed. Right on the Nile.

1214
01:45:08,831 --> 01:45:10,915
Are you the detective?

1215
01:45:12,207 --> 01:45:13,999
Yes.

1216
01:45:15,455 --> 01:45:18,083
I'm detective.

1217
01:45:18,291 --> 01:45:20,623
Would you like to fix your tie?

1218
01:45:24,455 --> 01:45:26,791
I encounter you by the car.

1219
01:46:22,707 --> 01:46:25,207
Be sure to step in.
