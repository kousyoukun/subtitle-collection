Instead of lead. Ice!

46
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:38,667
The murderer pours water
into a .38 caliber mold,

47
00:04:38,736 --> 00:04:42,638
freezes it, and keeps it solid
until the crime.

48
00:04:42,706 --> 00:04:45,140
Then he shoots the guy
with the ice bullet.

a few drops of water.

Um, he's not herejust now.

01:18:16,335 --> 01:18:18,633
May I askwho's calling,
please?

802
01:18:18,704 --> 01:18:20,535
How do you feel?
You O.K.?

803
01:18:20,606 --> 01:18:23,040
What did you do
to those people?

804
01:18:23,109 --> 01:18:26,135
What people?
I don't know who they are.

805
01:18:26,212 --> 01:18:29,147
I file a report.
A guy in Washington reads it.

806
01:18:29,215 --> 01:18:31,479
He's supposed to--
He's my section chief.

807
01:18:31,551 --> 01:18:33,985
He comes to New York
to shoot me.

808
01:18:34,053 --> 01:18:36,487
- Did you know him?
- No.

809
01:18:36,556 --> 01:18:38,922
Did you know the mailman?

810
01:18:38,991 --> 01:18:42,154
No, but the guy
in Washington did.

811
01:18:42,228 --> 01:18:46,028
- You won't know the next one.
- I'm not waiting for the next one.

812
01:18:46,098 --> 01:18:49,966
- Has he gone double or dirty?
- I don't know, sir.

813
01:18:50,036 --> 01:18:53,597
- You think he's still in New York City?
- I wouldn't be.

01:18:53,673 --> 01:18:56,005
Question-- Is there
an intelligence network...

Let's not become conspicuous.

818

Ifcompany agents aren't enough,
use freelance.

819

but end it.

Personally, I'd do it,

843
01:22:26,417 --> 01:22:29,113
because he has this huge gun,

You didn't start killing my friends
till yesterday.

- Who's she?
- Who hit the Lit Society?

857

-No, no..Higgins. C'Mon! ..Do you know him?

01:24:52,364 --> 01:24:54,992
- Professionally, yes.
- Professionally, he kills people.

865
01:24:55,067 --> 01:24:57,228
Yes. Yes.

866
01:24:57,302 --> 01:24:59,930
- He works for the company?
- He did once.

867
01:25:00,005 --> 01:25:02,132
- He's a contract agent.
- Contract agent.

868

Freelance.

869
01:25:04,343 --> 01:25:06,607
Where did you see him?

870
01:25:08,413 --> 01:25:11,712
- Uh-uh.
- It would help if I knew.

871
01:25:11,783 --> 01:25:15,082
- Who would it help? Who'd hire him now?
- Anybody.

872
01:25:15,153 --> 01:25:17,348
Terrific answer.

873
01:25:17,422 --> 01:25:20,255
- I wouldn't accept it, either.
- What's his name?

874
01:25:20,325 --> 01:25:23,522
- When I knew him,Joubert.
- Come on, Higgins.

875
01:25:23,595 --> 01:25:26,325
Who'd hire him? You don't look up
Joubert in the yellow pages.

876
01:25:26,398 --> 01:25:30,494
That's right. It'd have to be
somebody in the community.

877
01:25:30,569 --> 01:25:32,503
- Community?
- Intelligence field.

Community! Jesus, you guys are kind
to yourselves. Community.

01:25:37,142 --> 01:25:40,578
I want to see
that report, Turner.

880
01:25:40,646 --> 01:25:43,012
That report was sent to headquarters
and disappeared.

881
01:25:43,081 --> 01:25:46,346
- Who read it?
- You mean besides Wicks?

882
01:25:48,420 --> 01:25:50,354
You tell me.

883
01:25:52,758 --> 01:25:56,694
I pick up traces of what I think
an intelligence network

884
01:25:56,762 --> 01:25:59,697
the company doesn't know about,
and I report it.

885
01:25:59,765 --> 01:26:03,030
Now, why is that going
to make anybody mad?

886
01:26:03,101 --> 01:26:05,365
Unless it was
the company's network

887
01:26:05,437 --> 01:26:08,634
and you didn't want it blown,
even to your own guys.

888
01:26:08,707 --> 01:26:12,143
Unless somebody is lying,
Higgins.

889
01:26:12,210 --> 01:26:14,770
Come on.

890
01:26:14,846 --> 01:26:18,043
Why is everybody so shy?

891
01:26:18,116 --> 01:26:20,744
I'm not shy.

892
01:26:21,820 --> 01:26:24,687
I don't know.
That's what worries me.

893
01:26:26,091 --> 01:26:28,616
- I don't know.
- Ask Wicks.

894
01:26:28,694 --> 01:26:30,992
Wicks died.

895
01:26:33,565 --> 01:26:37,661
Someone yanked him off the life
support system at Guvenor Hospital.

896
01:26:48,447 --> 01:26:51,348
Get me in, Higgins.

and they are inside?

What good would it do
to bring you in?

- Trust.

914
01:27:59,251 --> 01:28:01,219
Does he trust you?

915
01:28:01,286 --> 01:28:04,221
He's in the suspicion business.
He can't trust anybody.

916
01:28:04,289 --> 01:28:07,281
- How could anybody fool them?
- Maybe nobody did.

01:47:43,685 --> 01:47:45,619
What about the girl?

1111
01:47:46,755 --> 01:47:49,485
She was chosen... how?

1112
01:47:49,558 --> 01:47:51,890
By-- By age?

1113
01:47:51,960 --> 01:47:54,861
Her car? Appearance?

1114
01:47:54,930 --> 01:47:59,060
At random. Chance.

1115
01:47:59,134 --> 01:48:01,068
Really.

1116
01:48:03,839 --> 01:48:05,773
Can I dropyou?

1117
01:48:08,310 --> 01:48:11,108
[Sigh]

1118
01:48:11,179 --> 01:48:14,114
I'd like to go back
to New York.

1119
01:48:16,151 --> 01:48:18,381
You have not
much future there.

1120
01:48:24,893 --> 01:48:26,827
It will happen this way.

1121
01:48:27,996 --> 01:48:30,897
You may be walking.

1122
01:48:30,966 --> 01:48:34,800
Maybe the first sunny day
of the spring,

1123
01:48:34,870 --> 01:48:38,101
and a carwill slow
beside you,

1124
01:48:38,173 --> 01:48:40,107
and the doorwill open,

1125
01:48:40,175 --> 01:48:43,110
and someone you know,
maybe even trust,

1126
01:48:43,178 --> 01:48:45,544
will get out of the car.

1127
01:48:47,415 --> 01:48:50,942
And he will smile,
a becoming smile.

1128
01:48:52,721 --> 01:48:57,021
But he will leave open
the door of the car

1129
01:48:57,092 --> 01:49:00,289
and offer to give you a lift.

1130
01:49:05,300 --> 01:49:08,633
You seem to understand
it all so well.

1131
01:49:11,206 --> 01:49:13,140
What would you suggest?

1132
01:49:13,208 --> 01:49:16,939
Personally, I prefer Europe.

1133
01:49:17,012 --> 01:49:19,708
- Europe?
- Yes.

1134
01:49:19,781 --> 01:49:22,147
Well, the fact is,

1135
01:49:22,217 --> 01:49:25,584
what I do is not
a bad occupation.

1136
01:49:25,654 --> 01:49:28,020
Someone is always
willing to pay.

1137
01:49:32,661 --> 01:49:35,152
I would find it...

1138
01:49:35,230 --> 01:49:37,164
tiring.

1139
01:49:37,232 --> 01:49:40,929
Oh, no. It's quite restful.
It's almost peaceful.

1140
01:49:41,002 --> 01:49:45,336
No need to believe
in either side or any side.

1141
01:49:45,407 --> 01:49:47,705
There is no cause.

1142
01:49:47,776 --> 01:49:49,801
There's onlyyourself.

1143
01:49:49,878 --> 01:49:52,676
The beliefis in
your own precision.

1144
01:49:58,753 --> 01:50:02,189
I was born in the United States,
Joubert.

1145
01:50:03,792 --> 01:50:06,818
I miss it when
I'm away too long.

1146
01:50:06,895 --> 01:50:09,227
A pity.

1147
01:50:11,700 --> 01:50:13,634
I don't think so.

1148
01:50:15,203 --> 01:50:19,333
Is it any trouble to drop me
at the Union Station?

1149
01:50:19,407 --> 01:50:22,467
Oh, no.
It would be my pleasure.

1150
01:50:31,586 --> 01:50:34,282
For that day.

1151
01:50:34,456 --> 01:50:36,651
[Carolers]
% Remember Christ, our Savior%

1157
01:50:53,408 --> 01:50:55,706
Higgins!

1158
01:50:57,312 --> 01:50:59,837
Higgins!

1159
01:51:09,024 --> 01:51:14,052
% Oh, tidings of comfort andjoy

% Oh, tidings of comfort andjoy%%

1161
01:51:17,032 --> 01:51:19,830
Why'd you call so late?
We were worried about you.

1162
01:51:19,901 --> 01:51:21,664
Likewise. The car for me?

1163
01:51:21,736 --> 01:51:24,899
It's all right. It's safe.
You'll have a few hours of debriefing.

1164
01:51:24,973 --> 01:51:28,170
- Hey, Higgins?
- Yeah?

1165
01:51:28,243 --> 01:51:31,735
Let's say,
for the purposes of argument,

1166
01:51:31,813 --> 01:51:35,613
I had a .45
in one ofmy pockets

1167
01:51:35,684 --> 01:51:38,118
and I wanted you
to walk with me.

1168
01:51:38,186 --> 01:51:40,916
You'd do it, right?

1169
01:51:40,989 --> 01:51:43,355
Which way?

1170
01:51:43,425 --> 01:51:46,292
West. And slowly.

1171
01:51:46,361 --> 01:51:50,297
Stay in front ofme
about three or four steps.

1172
01:51:58,173 --> 01:52:00,107
Where we going?

1173
01:52:01,276 --> 01:52:03,210
Wave them on ahead.

1174
01:52:13,021 --> 01:52:16,457
Do we have plans to invade
the Middle East?

1175
01:52:16,524 --> 01:52:18,958
- are you crazy?
- Am l?

1176
01:52:19,027 --> 01:52:21,393
- Look, Turner--
- Do we have plans?

1177
01:52:21,463 --> 01:52:23,397
No. Absolutely not.

1178
01:52:23,465 --> 01:52:26,559
We have games. That's all.

1179
01:52:26,634 --> 01:52:29,102
We play games-- What if?

1180
01:52:29,170 --> 01:52:32,105
How many men?
What would it take?

1181
01:52:32,173 --> 01:52:35,267
Is there a cheaper way
to destabilize a regime?

1182
01:52:35,343 --> 01:52:39,074
- That's what we're paid to do.
- Walk on.

1183
01:52:39,147 --> 01:52:41,081
Go on.

1184
01:52:44,486 --> 01:52:47,421
So Atwood just took the games
too seriously.

1185
01:52:47,489 --> 01:52:52,256
He was really going to do it,
wasn't he? A renegade operation.

1186
01:52:52,327 --> 01:52:54,921
Atwood knew 541 2 would
never authorize it,

1187
01:52:54,996 --> 01:52:57,430
not with the heat
on the company.

1188
01:52:57,499 --> 01:52:59,933
What ifthere hadn't
been any heat?

1189
01:53:00,001 --> 01:53:02,936
Suppose I hadn't stumbled
on their plan?

1190
01:53:03,004 --> 01:53:05,268
Different ballgame.

1191
01:53:05,340 --> 01:53:08,275
Fact is, there was nothing wrong
with the plan.

1192
01:53:08,343 --> 01:53:13,280
The plan was all right.
The plan would've worked.

1193
01:53:13,348 --> 01:53:15,782
Boy, what is it
with you people?

1194
01:53:15,850 --> 01:53:19,809
You think not getting caught in a lie
is the same thing as telling the truth?

1195
01:53:19,888 --> 01:53:22,482
No. It's simple economics.

1196
01:53:22,557 --> 01:53:24,491
Today it's oil, right?

1197
01:53:24,559 --> 01:53:29,587
In 1 0 or 1 5 years-- food, plutonium,
and maybe even sooner.

1198
01:53:29,664 --> 01:53:32,792
What do you think the people
are going to want us to do then?

1199
01:53:32,867 --> 01:53:34,960
Ask them.

1200
01:53:35,036 --> 01:53:38,369
Now now. Then. Ask them
when they're running out.

1201
01:53:38,439 --> 01:53:41,374
Ask them when there's no heat
and they're cold.

1202
01:53:41,442 --> 01:53:43,376
Ask them when
their engines stop.

1203
01:53:43,444 --> 01:53:47,380
Ask them when people who have never
known hunger start going hungry.

1204
01:53:47,448 --> 01:53:50,884
Want to know something?
They won't want us to ask them.

1205
01:53:50,952 --> 01:53:53,386
They'll want us
to get it for them.

1206
01:53:53,454 --> 01:53:55,786
Boy,

1207
01:53:55,857 --> 01:53:57,950
have you found a home.

1208
01:53:59,227 --> 01:54:01,661
There were seven people
killed, Higgins.

1209
01:54:01,729 --> 01:54:04,755
- The company didn't order it.
- Atwood did.

1210
01:54:04,833 --> 01:54:08,599
Atwood did.
And who the hell is Atwood?

1211
01:54:08,670 --> 01:54:10,604
He's you.
He's all you guys.

1212
01:54:10,672 --> 01:54:14,403
Seven people killed,
and you play fucking games!

1213
01:54:14,475 --> 01:54:18,639
Right.
And the other side does, too.

1214
01:54:18,713 --> 01:54:21,443
That's why we can't let you
stay outside.

1215
01:54:21,516 --> 01:54:26,146
Well, go on home, Higgins.
Go on. They've got it.

1216
01:54:26,221 --> 01:54:28,655
- What?
- You know where we are.

1217
01:54:28,723 --> 01:54:32,454
Just look around. They've got it.
That's where they ship from.

1218
01:54:32,527 --> 01:54:34,461
They've got all ofit.

1219
01:54:43,872 --> 01:54:45,806
What? What did you do?

1220
01:54:45,874 --> 01:54:48,069
I told them a story.

1221
01:54:48,142 --> 01:54:52,238
You play games,
I told them a story.

1222
01:55:00,154 --> 01:55:02,247
Oh, you--

1223
01:55:02,323 --> 01:55:05,258
You poor, dumb
son ofa bitch.

1224
01:55:05,326 --> 01:55:08,352
You've done more damage
than you know.

1225
01:55:09,898 --> 01:55:11,889
I hope so.

1226
01:55:20,174 --> 01:55:22,506
You're about to be
a very lonely man.

1227
01:55:25,847 --> 01:55:28,281
It didn't have
to end this way.

1228
01:55:28,349 --> 01:55:30,510
Of course it did.

1229
01:55:32,787 --> 01:55:35,381
Hey, Turner.

1230
01:55:35,456 --> 01:55:39,085
How do you know
they'll print it?

1231
01:55:40,461 --> 01:55:42,725
You can take a walk,

1232
01:55:42,797 --> 01:55:45,527
but how far if they
don't print it?

1233
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:48,296
They'll print it.

1234
01:55:48,369 --> 01:55:50,769
How do you know?
