1
00:01:23,959 --> 00:01:28,379
Tell her what you got. - Male,
Caucasian, appears to have been shot.

2
00:01:28,964 --> 00:01:32,467
Where? - In his room.
- Very funny, Harold.

3
00:01:32,885 --> 00:01:37,430
The wound is just below the heart.
- Shot once? - Seems to have been.

4
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:40,641
Turner...?

5
00:01:46,106 --> 00:01:50,151
Dr. Lappe, I'm sure he's going to be
here any second now. - Really?

6
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:55,156
Mr. Turner is late again.

7
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:14,967
Let's get back to work.
- We can do that in five minutes.

8
00:02:15,385 --> 00:02:19,597
You know what Joey would say?
- Come on!

9
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:23,893
What kind of a slug?
- You're missing the point.

10
00:02:24,353 --> 00:02:30,233
The machine will come back with a
rephrase. - What do we feed in?

11
00:03:32,504 --> 00:03:36,841
Turner, Joseph. - 17 minutes late.
- Make it 12, there was a headwind.

12
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:41,512
Dr. Lappe, anything in the
early pouch for me?

13
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,222
Dr. Lappe?

14
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,558
Nothing in response to your report.

15
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,980
Please analyze the book on your desk
by 4 o'clock. - Yes, sir.

16
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:54,358
I'd move the Tolmiea to the light,

17
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:56,986
the leaves are getting a blight.

18
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,784
At ease, Sarge, at ease.
It's going to rain today, at 10:20.

19
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,833
There must be more details.
- I only read two chapters.

20
00:04:11,335 --> 00:04:14,337
No other clues?
- What time did they find him?

21
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:19,342
Doesn't say. Just early evening.
- They never said what caliber.

22
00:04:19,843 --> 00:04:22,929
Apparently a.38.
- Why "apparently?"

23
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,558
The entry wound was characteristic of
a.38, but the slug wasn't recovered.

24
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:32,480
Hey, we're getting somewhere.
- You guys figure it out.

25
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,942
I have Far East journals to read.
- Was the slug in the wall?

26
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,986
No, there was no exit wound.

27
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,573
We're not getting anywhere.
Finish the book.

28
00:04:46,119 --> 00:04:48,579
Hi. What we've got so far...

29
00:04:49,081 --> 00:04:50,456
Ice.

30
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:53,459
Instead of lead. Ice.

31
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:58,422
The murderer pours water into a.38
caliber mold and freezes it.

32
00:04:59,675 --> 00:05:04,428
He shoots the guy with the ice bullet.
The cops find a few drops of water.

33
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,182
No bullet, no ballistics.
- That's great!

34
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,187
What is this?

35
00:05:15,816 --> 00:05:19,068
Beautiful calligraphy.
- What is it? - It means heaven.

36
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:25,324
Nothing else? - It can mean
"the best" or "tops". Why?

37
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:31,914
I'm not sure. - We're going to Sam
and Mae's tonight, right?

38
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:34,959
Talk to Sam about it.
- About this?

39
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,463
I did. He said, "that's interesting,
but it's not my department."

40
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:43,342
Which means he doesn't think there's
anything, just like Dr. Lappe.

41
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:49,348
And you. - There's not much.
A mystery that's been translated.

42
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,728
A mystery that didn't sell and has
been translated into odd languages.

43
00:05:54,229 --> 00:05:58,274
Turkish, but not French.
Arabic, but not Russian or German.

44
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:01,277
Dutch.
- Spanish?

45
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,737
Yes.

46
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:10,161
Where did you get that about the ice?
Dashiell Hammett? - Dick Tracy.

47
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:13,414
Are you sure about this ideogram?

48
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:17,585
Look at this face. Could I be wrong
about an ideogram?

49
00:06:18,962 --> 00:06:23,215
It's a great face.
But it's never been to China.

50
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:35,895
Ray, when can I get some
computer time? - Dick Tracy?

51
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,857
A very underrated detective.
- There's some free time at 2:45.

52
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:44,987
No, stay on schedule, I'll get it.

53
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,451
Four pieces, right?
- Right. - Hold it!

54
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,745
Five.
- Affirmative, five.

55
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:57,208
Where is Mr. Heidegger? - He called
in sick. - Probably hung over again.

56
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:01,295
This is extraordinary.
I was just checking the files and I

57
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:05,007
came across an inquiry he sent
to Persian Gulf command.

58
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:09,512
He did that for me.
- It never went through my office.

59
00:07:10,013 --> 00:07:12,973
I asked for some research,
he didn't feel it was important.

60
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:17,812
I wish you people
would go through channels.

61
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,155
What's on your mind?

62
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,831
This was in the pouch
from New York Central.

63
00:08:18,999 --> 00:08:23,836
HQ in Langley says there's no other
source to support your theory.

64
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,465
Call this working on that book?
- I'll have it by 4pm.

65
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:34,889
We have people to service machines.
- These things just look complicated.

66
00:08:35,390 --> 00:08:38,684
I wonder if you are
entirely happy here.

67
00:08:39,436 --> 00:08:42,688
Within obvious limits, yes, sir.
- Obvious limits?

68
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:48,068
I can't tell people what I do.
- Why can't you accept that?

69
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:53,908
I actually trust a few people.
That's the problem.

70
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,369
It's your turn to bring in lunch.

71
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:59,371
What time is it?

72
00:09:00,874 --> 00:09:04,376
11:22.
- The rain's gonna stop by 11:30.

73
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,962
You can wait 8 minutes.

74
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:58,889
That's not a proper exit! - He always
goes out that way when it rains.

75
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:03,978
Personnel should enter and exit
by authorized means only!

76
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:57,281
Shakespeare, how is it? - Terrific.
The rejection slips just pile up.

77
00:10:57,782 --> 00:11:01,243
Know the feeling.
I always wanted to be Escoffier.

78
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:05,748
Maybe it's not too late. Van Gogh
was 30 before he began to paint.

79
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:08,459
No mayonnaise on Dr. Lappe's.

80
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:13,339
On the other hand, Mozart was 3 when
he started piano, and composed at 6.

81
00:11:13,882 --> 00:11:19,386
Fast starter, probably better.
- Van Gogh never sold a painting

82
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:23,057
and Mozart died a pauper.
- Am I in the Public Library?

83
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:27,603
Hey, that's a very bright man!
- Educational. That's why I come here.

84
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,898
I come in here to get sick,
just like everybody else.

85
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:34,777
No butter on Ray's sandwich.
He gets very panicky about butter.

86
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,987
Mr. Jennings is in the back.
He'll sign for it.

87
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:01,613
Here are the...

88
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:24,761
Mrs. Russell, the Curtis report...

89
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,247
Would you move
from the window, please?

90
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:36,833
Pardon?

91
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:39,753
Would you move from the window?

92
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:53,225
I won't scream.

93
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,728
I know.

94
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:42,524
Small breakdown in security there?

95
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,278
What are you doin'?

96
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,264
What the hell are you doing?
Sleep at night, will ya?

97
00:20:08,165 --> 00:20:10,375
This is the Major.
- Joe Turner.

98
00:20:10,877 --> 00:20:15,338
Identification? - My name is Turner.
I work for you. Now listen...

99
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,593
Identify yourself.
What is your designation?

100
00:20:20,094 --> 00:20:25,432
Condor. Section 9, Department 17.
The section has been hit. - Level?

101
00:20:26,392 --> 00:20:32,230
Level of damage! - Everybody.
Dr. Lappe, Janice, Ray, Harold...

102
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:37,193
Are you on a company line?
- No, I'm in a phone booth.

103
00:20:37,695 --> 00:20:40,030
You're in violation of
communication procedures, Condor.

104
00:20:40,531 --> 00:20:45,744
Listen, you S.O. B... I came back with
lunch and the whole house was dead!

105
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,706
Has the incident been discovered
by anybody outside the company?

106
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,960
I don't know. I don't think so.
- Are you damaged?

107
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:58,506
Damaged...? No.
- Are you armed?

108
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:05,180
I have Mrs... I can't remember
her code name... Nightingale.

109
00:21:05,681 --> 00:21:09,184
She was afraid of being raped.
I've got her gun. - Identify it.

110
00:21:09,936 --> 00:21:13,647
It's a.45 automatic.
Will you guys bring me in, please?

111
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:17,025
I'm not a field agent.
I just read books! - Leave the area.

112
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,195
Alright.
Do I come into headquarters now?

113
00:21:20,696 --> 00:21:24,658
Negative. Find a secure location.
- Where?

114
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,911
Avoid any place you are known.
Do not go home.

115
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:32,791
Surface again in two hours
and call the Major.

116
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:39,297
That'll be 14:30 your time.
- Wait a minute, 2:30, right.

117
00:21:39,799 --> 00:21:43,760
Walk away from the phone.
Don't hang it up. - Don't hang it...?

118
00:21:56,482 --> 00:22:00,235
This is the Panic Officer.
Section 9-17 may have been hit.

119
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:06,866
Activate following procedures:
NY 1-2-7, D.C. 4-6-9.

120
00:22:07,368 --> 00:22:09,452
Replay the report upcoming. Standby.

121
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:05,675
Augie 1 to New York Center:
- Go ahead, Augie 1.

122
00:23:06,177 --> 00:23:08,845
Who am I talking to?
- Higgins, Deputy Director. Go ahead.

123
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:15,351
Hit confirmed. Six cold items.
- Quality? - Clean, fast, first rate.

124
00:23:16,771 --> 00:23:22,233
Did you say 6? It should be 7.
- I repeat: 6. Here's a rundown:

125
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,445
Lappe, Chan, Russell, Jennings.

126
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:29,449
Martin and Mitchell.
- Alright Augie 1. Find 7.

127
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:41,503
"Condor".

128
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:48,134
Researcher, Tidepool,
likes to read comics.

129
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,197
Who is it?

130
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,737
Hey, you ring my buzzer?

131
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,364
It was a mistake, buddy.

132
00:25:33,991 --> 00:25:35,909
Not you guys!

133
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:46,628
Hey, who are you?
Hey, who the hell are you?

134
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:52,175
Augie 3. We found item 7.
Ralf Heidegger. He bought it at home.

135
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:55,970
Okay, button it up, Augie.
I'll send you more janitors.

136
00:25:57,306 --> 00:25:59,390
I need Langley, right away.
- Yes, sir.

137
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:05,855
Grover speaking. - Higgins, Deputy
Director, NY. Give me Department 17.

138
00:26:12,488 --> 00:26:15,823
Somebody took out
one of your sections: 9-17.

139
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:20,453
New York. Somebody got mugged, maybe?
- They were hit.

140
00:26:20,955 --> 00:26:25,708
They're bookworms! - They got 7 out
of 8. We're on the shuttle. 30 mins.

141
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:28,253
One of my people is still okay?
- Condor. You know him?

142
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:33,383
No. Can he say what happened?
- He was literally out to lunch.

143
00:26:33,884 --> 00:26:37,595
What happened? - He's not in yet.
His first call was a little wild.

144
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:43,268
Who's bringing him in? - Higgins.
He's already booked on the shuttle.

145
00:26:43,769 --> 00:26:48,273
I want a chopper on the pad,
fuel for New York, now.

146
00:27:04,832 --> 00:27:08,084
They're waiting for you.
- What? - Your two friends.

147
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:16,843
They just got here.
Said you gave them the keys.

148
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,472
Mr. Turner?

149
00:27:54,048 --> 00:27:59,677
This is the Major. - This is Condor.
- Standby. Routing you to NY Center.

150
00:28:02,431 --> 00:28:04,932
Condor on 1-1, Mr. Higgins.

151
00:28:05,893 --> 00:28:07,518
Hello, Condor.

152
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:12,357
Who's this? - Deputy Director Higgins,
New York Center. Where are you?

153
00:28:12,858 --> 00:28:14,859
I need a code name, why don't you?

154
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:18,571
Where are you?

155
00:28:20,157 --> 00:28:21,032
Here.

156
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:26,287
You alright?
- Are you insane? Everybody's dead!

157
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:31,084
Take it easy and we'll bring you home.
Here's how:

158
00:28:31,585 --> 00:28:37,256
Do you know the Ansonia Hotel?
- Broadway and 71 st. - 73rd.

159
00:28:37,758 --> 00:28:42,053
There's an alley behind the hotel.
One hour from now, at exactly 15:30,

160
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:46,724
I want you to enter that alley
from the 73rd Street side.

161
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,477
Will you be there?

162
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:54,690
The head of department came from D. C...
He'll bring you home.

163
00:28:55,442 --> 00:29:00,655
I've never met him. - Don't worry.
He's studying your photos now.

164
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:14,585
I don't know you either.
- We'll meet.

165
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:19,841
He'll carry a Wall Street Journal.
- There were two guys at my house.

166
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:24,387
What were you doing there?
- I was homesick. Who were they?

167
00:29:25,139 --> 00:29:28,599
They were ours.
- What were they doing in my house?

168
00:29:29,852 --> 00:29:33,229
I'm not going in any alley
and fuck the Wall Street Journal!

169
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:38,025
Turner, it's been a long, bad day.
You've been under... - Damn right!

170
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:48,035
Alright. We'll bring a familiar face.
Somebody you know.

171
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:54,167
Who's left? - You've got a friend in
statistics named Sam Barber.

172
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:01,841
You guys are something...
- Will he do?

173
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:03,593
Yes. Sam will do.

174
00:30:05,471 --> 00:30:09,557
Alright, Turner. Stay well
for 60 minutes and you're home.

175
00:30:10,142 --> 00:30:12,768
Can I ask a question?
- Sure.

176
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:18,065
What is happening?
- I'll talk to you in 60 minutes.

177
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,362
You've got 55.

178
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:28,242
This is ridiculous.
- It's standard procedure.

179
00:30:28,744 --> 00:30:32,246
To pick up a friend?
- And you, Mr. Wicks? - No, thanks.

180
00:30:32,748 --> 00:30:34,916
Side arm?
- Have you got a.45?

181
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:38,211
You bet.
- Hey, let me help you with that.

182
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:44,926
How long have you known Condor?
- Joey...

183
00:30:45,427 --> 00:30:50,765
Before he was a bird even.
We went to CCNY. My wife Mae, too.

184
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:54,101
Was she ever Condor's girl?
- Here you go, Mr. Wicks.

185
00:31:00,776 --> 00:31:02,610
Tell me what happened today.
- When?

186
00:31:03,111 --> 00:31:05,988
This morning. About those murders.

187
00:31:07,366 --> 00:31:08,574
What murders?

188
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:21,439
Here he is.

189
00:32:38,248 --> 00:32:40,458
Hey, Sam. Where's that other...

190
00:32:46,298 --> 00:32:49,050
What are you doing?
It's him, it's him!

191
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:04,542
Katherine Hale. H-A-L-E.

192
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,877
08-11-56...

193
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:12,758
...172-208-875. Amount $51,86

194
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:16,804
Where's there enough snow this early?
- In Vermont.

195
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:19,265
What's open, Sugar Bush?
- Not downhill.

196
00:34:19,766 --> 00:34:23,769
This is cross-country.
- Don't like the lift lines?

197
00:34:24,271 --> 00:34:26,313
474, thank you.

198
00:34:37,743 --> 00:34:38,784
Kathy!

199
00:34:39,953 --> 00:34:42,580
Kathy, where have you been?
Let me give you a hand.

200
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:46,959
Wait, I don't know...
- Be quiet.

201
00:34:47,461 --> 00:34:49,795
Get in the car.
Don't make a sound, don't be dumb.

202
00:34:58,263 --> 00:35:02,308
Please don't hurt me. - Where
do you live? - Brooklyn Heights.

203
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:05,728
Alone?
- I live with a friend...

204
00:35:06,855 --> 00:35:08,564
You live alone. Come on, let's go.

205
00:37:39,799 --> 00:37:41,717
Leave the stuff.

206
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,351
Hi, Kath.

207
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,814
You should have said hello.

208
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:58,567
Where is it?
- Here.

209
00:38:04,866 --> 00:38:06,951
"Condor shot us both."

210
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:10,871
That was the only statement he could
make before they operated on him.

211
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:15,542
And the other man, Barber? Is he dead?
- Before he hit the ground.

212
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:20,506
A remarkable shot.
A half-inch above his flak jacket.

213
00:38:23,093 --> 00:38:26,011
Was Condor qualified with a handgun?

214
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:32,643
"Two years military service,
Signal Corps,

215
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:36,355
Telephone lineman, switchboard
maintenance, 6 months overseas,

216
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:40,901
Separated 9/61, worked at
communication research college."

217
00:38:41,695 --> 00:38:44,863
The question was:
Is he qualified with a handgun?

218
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,700
No, sir. M-1 rifle and carbine.

219
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:50,452
Evidently it was sheer luck.

220
00:38:50,954 --> 00:38:52,162
Or else...

221
00:38:54,374 --> 00:38:58,377
Or else what? - Condor isn't the man
his file says he is.

222
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,672
Where did he learn the basic moves?
- He reads.

223
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:06,844
What the hell does that mean?
- He reads everything.

224
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:10,472
I don't understand...
- Yes... very good.

225
00:39:11,266 --> 00:39:15,561
Has Operations got anything?
- Absolutely nothing. - Extraordinary.

226
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:19,732
It was very well executed.
- It requires planning, communication,

227
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:23,944
tracks.
I'm not asking for footprints

228
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:27,406
but a blade of grass,
a broken twig...

229
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:32,578
Yes, sir. Wicks seems to be
all we've got. - Where do we have him?

230
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,830
We don't.

231
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,794
They rushed him to emergency
before we got word.

232
00:39:41,421 --> 00:39:44,923
Maybe we should leak the name of the
hospital. Get Condor to make a move.

233
00:39:45,425 --> 00:39:49,053
Don't expect
too many mistakes from this man.

234
00:39:49,554 --> 00:39:53,849
He does seem rather more interesting
than just another reader researcher.

235
00:39:54,350 --> 00:40:00,481
Example: Has he gone into business
for himself? Was he turned around?

236
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:05,444
Does someone operate him?
Sexual? Broke?

237
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:10,199
Vulnerable?
Could he be a soldier of fortune?

238
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,951
Did he arrange the hit?

239
00:40:13,411 --> 00:40:15,662
Is that why he's still in flight?

240
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:19,249
Still, he may be an innocent.

241
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:25,130
But then, why didn't he
come in gently, with Mr Wicks?

242
00:40:28,927 --> 00:40:32,930
"Tentrex Industries". - It's a cover.
I work for the CIA.

243
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:37,893
Jesus, your assignment for today
was to go out and kidnap a girl.

244
00:40:39,020 --> 00:40:42,940
Look it up. "Tentrex Industries".

245
00:40:45,485 --> 00:40:49,321
And look up the number for the CIA in
New York. - You mean it's listed?

246
00:40:49,823 --> 00:40:51,573
Under US Government Agencies.

247
00:40:56,704 --> 00:41:00,332
Is this what you do?
This photography?

248
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:09,466
It's the same number. You could have
had the card made. - But I didn't.

249
00:41:10,343 --> 00:41:13,262
You really get into it, don't you?
- Sit down!

250
00:41:18,059 --> 00:41:19,560
I told you I had a friend.

251
00:41:21,813 --> 00:41:25,941
I take 15,5/34. What size are you?
- What are you, a clown?

252
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:30,070
I'm scared! - So am I! - What for?
You've got a gun! - Yes!

253
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,160
That is not enough.

254
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:57,347
I work for the CIA,
I'm not a spy.

255
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,687
I just read books.

256
00:42:11,279 --> 00:42:14,823
We read everything
that's published in the world.

257
00:42:15,325 --> 00:42:19,494
And we feed the plots,
dirty tricks, codes

258
00:42:19,996 --> 00:42:22,497
into a computer and the computer

259
00:42:22,999 --> 00:42:26,126
checks against
actual CIA plans and operations.

260
00:42:26,628 --> 00:42:28,378
I look for leaks,
I look for new ideas.

261
00:42:30,006 --> 00:42:34,843
We read adventures
and novels and journals...

262
00:42:38,806 --> 00:42:41,642
Who'd invent a job like that?

263
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,229
Listen!

264
00:42:46,856 --> 00:42:51,944
People are trying to kill me! - Who?
- I don't know, but there's a reason.

265
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,113
There is a reason!

266
00:42:56,115 --> 00:43:02,496
And I just need some safe quiet time
to pull things together.

267
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:06,792
Here?
- Here.

268
00:43:08,503 --> 00:43:10,587
It's only fair...

269
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:32,776
Where's the guy with the shirts?
- He's skiing in the Green Mountains.

270
00:43:34,862 --> 00:43:37,364
We want to go cross-country skiing

271
00:43:37,949 --> 00:43:41,326
for a couple of weeks.
Away from everything.

272
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:50,002
What time's the news go on? Six?
- Six o'clock. - 40 Minutes.

273
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:09,479
No, please...

274
00:44:12,525 --> 00:44:15,027
Lie down against the wall.

275
00:44:16,154 --> 00:44:18,238
Put this arm behind you.

276
00:44:21,576 --> 00:44:23,327
Now you listen to me:

277
00:44:23,828 --> 00:44:25,287
I am tired.

278
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:29,249
I've got to close my eyes for a while.

279
00:44:29,751 --> 00:44:32,044
I can't think straight.

280
00:44:33,838 --> 00:44:37,591
If you try to move
or climb off the bed,

281
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,385
I'll know it. I'll feel it,

282
00:44:40,887 --> 00:44:44,014
and I promise I'll hurt you.

283
00:44:45,767 --> 00:44:48,268
Can't I stay in the other room?

284
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:55,442
I believe what you told me.

285
00:44:55,943 --> 00:44:57,903
No, you don't.

286
00:44:59,030 --> 00:45:01,490
I don't know if I do.

287
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,950
That includes Condor, of course.

288
00:45:04,452 --> 00:45:06,411
Yes, I owe you Condor.

289
00:45:06,913 --> 00:45:09,873
Otherwise...
- "Otherwise" does not exist.

290
00:45:11,918 --> 00:45:15,295
Will Condor take long?
- Do you want an estimate?

291
00:45:15,797 --> 00:45:19,383
There is a time factor.
- Always with you people.

292
00:45:21,511 --> 00:45:26,431
Condor is an amateur.
He's lost, unpredictable

293
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,684
and perhaps even sentimental.

294
00:45:30,186 --> 00:45:32,354
He could fool a professional.

295
00:45:34,190 --> 00:45:37,567
Not deliberately,
but precisely because he is lost.

296
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:40,195
He doesn't know what to do.

297
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:45,617
Unlike Wicks, who has always been
entirely predictable.

298
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:54,459
The man Condor killed
in the alley? - Some friend of his.

299
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:59,381
A close friend? - I suppose so. Why?
- It interests me.

300
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:02,759
What was his name?
- I don't know. He was nobody.

301
00:46:03,261 --> 00:46:05,095
He was somebody for Condor.

302
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:08,014
Get his name and address.

303
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:11,560
Have it for me when I call you.

304
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:14,729
What about Wicks?

305
00:46:19,485 --> 00:46:22,612
Do you want the firm to question him?

306
00:46:23,114 --> 00:46:25,073
They will, you know.

307
00:46:26,576 --> 00:46:28,326
We don't want that.

308
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:32,038
Cost you nothing.

309
00:46:32,540 --> 00:46:34,916
I was careless with Condor.

310
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:38,003
Wicks will be done for nothing.

311
00:46:42,091 --> 00:46:45,343
What time is it?
- It's news time.

312
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,394
Lonely pictures.

313
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,232
So?

314
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,695
You're funny.

315
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:52,994
You take pictures of empty streets
and trees without leaves...

316
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,081
It's winter.

317
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,416
Not quite winter...

318
00:48:00,586 --> 00:48:02,212
They look like...

319
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,674
...November.

320
00:48:06,175 --> 00:48:08,593
Not autumn, not winter, in-between.

321
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:15,392
I like them.

322
00:48:18,980 --> 00:48:20,105
Thanks.

323
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:31,491
The shootings behind
the Hotel Ansonia remain a mystery.

324
00:48:31,659 --> 00:48:34,869
The victims' identities
have not been revealed...

325
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,123
Victims?

326
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:43,253
Can you say anything about a motive?
- Not at present.

327
00:48:43,421 --> 00:48:48,800
Have you identified the victims?
- Insurance company employees. - What?

328
00:48:51,178 --> 00:48:54,598
Did the victims know their assailants?
- Absolutely not.

329
00:48:55,099 --> 00:49:00,020
One man dead, one seriously wounded
in an alley in Manhattan.

330
00:49:00,521 --> 00:49:05,442
And the man with the gun
is still at large. - Sam!

331
00:49:09,614 --> 00:49:12,907
Jesus Christ, victims...
What is he saying?

332
00:49:16,037 --> 00:49:18,121
What happened in that alley?

333
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:24,711
I didn't shoot him.
You shot somebody. - But not Sam!

334
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:29,674
Nobody in that alley
said anything about the CIA.

335
00:49:38,184 --> 00:49:39,851
But they were there.

336
00:49:43,481 --> 00:49:46,691
You're telling me... - They had to
have been to change that story.

337
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:50,820
What did Higgins say?
He said he wouldn't be there.

338
00:49:51,322 --> 00:49:54,032
The section chief was coming in...

339
00:49:58,037 --> 00:50:00,205
He'd have to reach Sam.

340
00:50:00,706 --> 00:50:02,707
Sam would have to call Mae.

341
00:50:30,736 --> 00:50:34,823
I need your car. - Grand theft! You
don't want trouble with the police.

342
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,204
This guy in Vermont. What'll he do
if you don't show up?

343
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,289
He probably call soon.

344
00:50:43,791 --> 00:50:47,961
Will he show up here?
- The gun gives you the right

345
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:52,882
to rough me up... - Rough you up?
- Yes, what are you doing in my house?

346
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,970
Have I raped you?
- The night is young.

347
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,322
You don't believe anything I've said.

348
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:23,580
I believe
you're in trouble. In danger.

349
00:51:25,332 --> 00:51:31,463
But I don't know what kind and I'm
not sure how much of it is made up.

350
00:51:34,508 --> 00:51:36,176
It doesn't matter.

351
00:51:36,802 --> 00:51:39,971
Wait a minute.
I'm trying to understand...

352
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:46,978
What are you doing? Let me go!

353
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,404
You bully!

354
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,073
Don't tie me up, please!

355
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:04,496
This is...

356
00:52:06,040 --> 00:52:08,958
...unfair!
- I know.

357
00:53:21,657 --> 00:53:23,366
You're early.

358
00:53:23,868 --> 00:53:25,285
Come on in.

359
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:29,414
Is Janice working late?

360
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:34,294
So is Sam.

361
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,758
Pour one for me, too, will you?

362
00:53:43,345 --> 00:53:46,973
It's their own fault
if we're zonked when they get here.

363
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:55,398
We'll give 'em an hour and if they're
not here, it's just you and me,

364
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,817
just like old times...

365
00:54:03,282 --> 00:54:04,782
What is it?

366
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:07,493
What is it, Joey?

367
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:09,996
What's wrong?

368
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,999
How do you know Sam's working late?

369
00:54:13,500 --> 00:54:17,754
What do you think he's doing?
- Did he call? - 2 or 2:30.

370
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:19,797
What did he say exactly?

371
00:54:20,299 --> 00:54:22,842
He had the Center call.

372
00:54:23,344 --> 00:54:28,556
Who? - I didnt't recognize the voice.
It wasn't the usual lady.

373
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:47,992
Third damn time tonight.
It's some creepy burglar.

374
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:52,121
I want you to get out of here.
- I can't, Joey, I'm cooking!

375
00:54:52,623 --> 00:54:55,500
Go to Bill and Eileen's.
Stay there till I call you.

376
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,714
Don't argue! Move!

377
00:55:02,216 --> 00:55:04,467
Go upstairs and stay there.

378
00:55:04,969 --> 00:55:08,721
Do what I'm telling you!
Stay there.

379
00:55:09,598 --> 00:55:12,475
I'll call you.
- Joey, you're scaring me!

380
00:56:07,281 --> 00:56:08,197
Yours?

381
00:56:12,953 --> 00:56:13,870
No.

382
00:56:37,561 --> 00:56:39,854
Fifth floor, ladies' underwear.

383
00:56:46,028 --> 00:56:47,653
Kids...

384
00:56:48,363 --> 00:56:50,615
Probably the same everywhere.

385
00:57:12,721 --> 00:57:14,680
That's the second floor.

386
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:19,644
I do it all the time.

387
00:57:31,615 --> 00:57:33,783
After you.
- Go ahead.

388
00:58:18,453 --> 00:58:20,413
Anybody here good with a coat hanger?

389
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:25,042
I locked my keys in my car.
I'll give you some money.

390
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:30,506
You can't tell me you never busted
into a car before. 5 bucks.

391
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:35,136
I don't have much time.
Okay? Come on.

392
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:38,097
Alright, 5 bucks.

393
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:34,630
I want you to answer the phone.

394
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:39,510
I'm not answering any phone!

395
01:00:40,679 --> 01:00:42,346
Answer it!

396
01:00:42,848 --> 01:00:45,599
Tell him what a great
son of a bitch you are!

397
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:50,187
I want you to be casual and nice.

398
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,528
Where the hell are you?

399
01:00:58,030 --> 01:01:00,406
Ben?
- Who do you think it is?

400
01:01:03,702 --> 01:01:08,289
You're supposed to be up here by now.
- I know...

401
01:01:09,416 --> 01:01:11,250
I was held up.

402
01:01:13,503 --> 01:01:18,382
That's no excuse. Come on.
Does this trip matter to you?

403
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,260
It matters.
- Yeah, sure...

404
01:01:21,762 --> 01:01:26,599
No, it does! - This has happened over
and over. Last minute some excuse.

405
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:30,644
No, this is different.
- What's up?

406
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:34,607
The car...

407
01:01:35,734 --> 01:01:39,487
...broke down.
- What broke down?

408
01:01:39,988 --> 01:01:44,408
The generator went.
- That's gonna take for ever.

409
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:50,206
Maybe not.
I tried to call you before, but...

410
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,042
The generator...
...it's going to take too long.

411
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:57,421
Look, forget about the car.
Take the bus first thing tomorrow.

412
01:01:57,923 --> 01:02:00,132
I'll try.

413
01:02:00,634 --> 01:02:05,846
Try...?
What's going on? Are you okay?

414
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:11,727
I'm okay. I'm fine.
- You don't sound so fine.

415
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:15,147
I wish you would understand.

416
01:02:16,274 --> 01:02:21,654
I do. I do. It's just that
I'm disappointed, that's all.

417
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:29,078
I really wanted
to be with you up here.

418
01:02:31,331 --> 01:02:32,540
I know.

419
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:37,837
We'll have time.
- Yeah.

420
01:02:40,382 --> 01:02:43,717
Get the very first bus
out in the morning, okay?

421
01:02:44,219 --> 01:02:45,553
Alright.

422
01:02:47,973 --> 01:02:50,599
Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night.

423
01:03:29,347 --> 01:03:31,140
Listen, I'll be going.

424
01:03:32,851 --> 01:03:34,143
In the morning.

425
01:03:39,065 --> 01:03:40,149
Where?

426
01:03:50,285 --> 01:03:52,077
Was it alright?

427
01:03:54,498 --> 01:03:55,915
Alright?

428
01:03:56,416 --> 01:03:59,293
Outside. Was it safe?

429
01:04:05,467 --> 01:04:07,510
I'm not sure.

430
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,857
I wish I knew more.

431
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,569
About you.

432
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,447
Yesterday...

433
01:04:29,824 --> 01:04:31,158
Today...

434
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:35,621
I don't remember yesterday.

435
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,750
Today it rained.

436
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:45,923
Why did you tie me up like that?

437
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:51,971
You thought I'd call the police.

438
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:56,642
I wouldn't have.

439
01:04:59,646 --> 01:05:00,521
Why?

440
01:05:02,941 --> 01:05:04,191
Sometimes...

441
01:05:05,527 --> 01:05:09,530
...I take a picture
that isn't like me,

442
01:05:10,031 --> 01:05:15,619
but I took it, so it is like me.

443
01:05:20,292 --> 01:05:22,418
I put those pictures away.

444
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,046
I'd like to see those pictures.

445
01:05:26,548 --> 01:05:28,716
We don't know each other that well.

446
01:05:38,018 --> 01:05:40,185
Do you know anybody that well?

447
01:05:40,687 --> 01:05:44,231
I don't think
I want to know you very well.

448
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,527
I don't think
you're going to live much longer.

449
01:05:51,906 --> 01:05:54,867
Well, I may surprise you.

450
01:05:57,704 --> 01:05:59,330
You're not telling the truth.

451
01:06:01,166 --> 01:06:04,460
What? - You want somebody,
who's not gonna live much longer.

452
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:08,297
At least somebody who'd be on his way.

453
01:06:10,759 --> 01:06:12,176
You take pictures.

454
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:15,971
Beautiful pictures...

455
01:06:16,848 --> 01:06:22,144
...of empty streets and trees
with no leaves in November.

456
01:06:22,646 --> 01:06:26,732
Why haven't you asked me
to untie your hands?

457
01:06:32,322 --> 01:06:34,114
How much do you want?

458
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:44,333
I just want to stop it.

459
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,676
For a few hours,

460
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:57,888
for the rest of the night.

461
01:07:01,851 --> 01:07:03,352
Then I'll go.

462
01:10:16,129 --> 01:10:19,673
What was his name?

463
01:10:20,592 --> 01:10:22,801
What did Higgins say?

464
01:10:23,303 --> 01:10:26,555
Your Department Head'll bring you in.
- I've never met him.

465
01:10:35,356 --> 01:10:36,648
Anything in the early pouch?

466
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:53,457
HQ at Langley says there's no other
source to support your theory.

467
01:11:25,990 --> 01:11:26,990
Wicks!

468
01:11:52,934 --> 01:11:56,269
You didn't sleep well.
- You didn't?

469
01:11:56,771 --> 01:11:58,271
No, you didn't.

470
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:01,274
You were up early.

471
01:12:02,193 --> 01:12:05,112
I had some thoughts.

472
01:12:07,240 --> 01:12:08,365
I've got a plan.

473
01:12:09,701 --> 01:12:12,327
I don't know
if it'll work or not, but...

474
01:12:15,373 --> 01:12:19,251
...I'll need your help.
- Have I ever denied you anything?

475
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:28,552
When things quiet down,

476
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:32,514
you really are
a very sweet man to be with.

477
01:12:36,269 --> 01:12:38,270
You had bad dreams.

478
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:40,856
You talked in your sleep.

479
01:12:42,525 --> 01:12:46,028
What did I say?
- Who's Janice?

480
01:12:51,576 --> 01:12:55,495
Was she a volunteer,
or a draftee like me?

481
01:12:58,499 --> 01:12:59,916
She was...

482
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:02,961
...a friend.

483
01:13:03,463 --> 01:13:04,838
She's dead.

484
01:13:10,845 --> 01:13:14,097
Do I have permission to shower?
- You don't have to help.

485
01:13:14,599 --> 01:13:18,477
I'll help. You can always depend on
the spy fucker.

486
01:13:27,153 --> 01:13:30,280
I'm sorry... - No.
- No, I didn't mean...

487
01:13:32,325 --> 01:13:35,994
I didn't mean to say that.
I'm really sorry.

488
01:13:38,331 --> 01:13:40,207
I'd like to help you.

489
01:14:04,816 --> 01:14:07,109
18... Isn't that...?
- Yes.

490
01:14:09,654 --> 01:14:12,322
A.I.D. In I.C.U. 1098.

491
01:14:23,251 --> 01:14:25,544
Insured package for Katherine Hale.

492
01:14:30,925 --> 01:14:32,259
Leave it on the stoop.

493
01:14:32,844 --> 01:14:34,594
Somebody's got to sign for it.

494
01:14:35,638 --> 01:14:37,722
She's not here.

495
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:39,724
Okay, you can sign.

496
01:14:48,109 --> 01:14:50,610
Her name on top, yours on the bottom.

497
01:14:53,531 --> 01:14:57,200
Wonderful. - Government pens.
I don't have another pen.

498
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,037
I'll get one.

499
01:16:31,504 --> 01:16:33,588
Now listen: You're okay.

500
01:16:34,090 --> 01:16:35,757
You're okay!

501
01:16:36,259 --> 01:16:40,428
Can you get dressed?
You're okay! Get dressed, hurry.

502
01:17:25,016 --> 01:17:26,474
Stella's Boutique.

503
01:17:28,269 --> 01:17:32,397
Extension 1891, please.
- Pardon me?

504
01:17:35,026 --> 01:17:40,363
Is this 6623799?
- Yes, it is.

505
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:46,369
There's no extension 1891? - We're
lucky if we have any phone service!

506
01:17:56,297 --> 01:17:57,839
Operator.

507
01:17:58,966 --> 01:18:03,470
What's the area code for Washington,
D.C.? - 202.

508
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,065
6311.

509
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:20,695
CIA, Langley?
- 6311.

510
01:18:22,740 --> 01:18:24,324
Extension 1891.

511
01:18:26,118 --> 01:18:27,369
1891.

512
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:30,622
Let me speak to Mr. Wicks.

513
01:18:33,125 --> 01:18:36,127
He's not here just now.
May I ask who's calling?

514
01:18:36,629 --> 01:18:40,799
How do you feel? Okay?
- What did you do to those people?

515
01:18:41,300 --> 01:18:44,302
What people?
I don't know who they are.

516
01:18:44,804 --> 01:18:48,932
I file a report
and a guy in Washington reads it.

517
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:52,227
Then he comes to New York to shoot me.
- Did you know him?

518
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:57,899
No. - Did you know the mailman?
- No,

519
01:18:58,401 --> 01:19:03,530
but the guy in Washington did. - And
the next one? - I won't wait for him.

520
01:19:04,031 --> 01:19:07,325
Has he gone double or dirty?
- I don't know, sir.

521
01:19:07,827 --> 01:19:11,121
Is he still in New York City?
- I wouldn't be.

522
01:19:11,622 --> 01:19:15,625
Question: Is there an intelligence
network undetected by the CIA,

523
01:19:16,210 --> 01:19:19,129
linking Arabic-speaking countries
with Spanish-speaking?

524
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:22,340
We're already visible,
let's not become conspicuous.

525
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:25,635
If our agents aren't enough,
use freelance.

526
01:19:26,137 --> 01:19:28,888
Use whatever it requires, but end it.

527
01:19:51,704 --> 01:19:53,705
Okay, let's get it over with.

528
01:20:00,087 --> 01:20:01,129
Thanks.

529
01:20:23,569 --> 01:20:25,945
Applications are here.

530
01:20:32,286 --> 01:20:35,872
See Mr. Addison. Turn right,
first door on your left.

531
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,318
Mr. Addison?

532
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:10,323
He's in Clearance.
You passed it on your left.

533
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:14,827
Sorry, thank you.

534
01:22:12,803 --> 01:22:15,138
I didn't get the job.

535
01:22:18,434 --> 01:22:19,892
Looks good...

536
01:22:21,895 --> 01:22:25,273
I have this friend and he asked me
to give you a message.

537
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:32,405
Quote: "Mr Higgins, this introduces
a friend of mine, 'Sparrow Hawk'.

538
01:22:33,657 --> 01:22:39,621
Please accompany her
to the Nassau Street exit, now."

539
01:22:42,666 --> 01:22:46,628
Personally, I'd do it,
because he has this huge gun

540
01:22:47,129 --> 01:22:50,632
and he's looking at us right now.

541
01:22:51,342 --> 01:22:55,094
I'll save this for you. Shall we?

542
01:22:59,725 --> 01:23:01,517
To your left, please.

543
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:26,584
Okay, sit up!
Back up against the panel.

544
01:23:28,045 --> 01:23:30,421
Take it easy, I'm not armed.

545
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:34,425
They could be DF-ing us if you have a
transmitter hidden. What's this?

546
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:40,014
DF? You do read everything, don't you?
- Something is rotten in the Company!

547
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:43,351
You never complained till yesterday.
- You never killed my friends before!

548
01:23:43,977 --> 01:23:46,270
Who's she?
- Who hit the Lit. Society?

549
01:23:46,980 --> 01:23:50,066
We had a big meeting about that.
Your name came up.

550
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:53,861
"Five Continents Imports".
Ring a bell?

551
01:23:55,864 --> 01:23:57,990
Where did you get that?
- The mailman.

552
01:23:58,492 --> 01:24:01,744
The one you sent
with the uniform, automatic gun...

553
01:24:02,246 --> 01:24:07,375
We never use mailmen. - Would you
know a tall blond man, 6ft 4?

554
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:13,798
Strong like a farmer, not American.
Accent, maybe Alsace-Lorraine?

555
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:42,744
Yes?
- Was the letter delivered?

556
01:24:43,620 --> 01:24:48,332
The return receipt has not arrived.
- You should have done it yourself.

557
01:24:48,834 --> 01:24:52,170
A more complicated package
had to be handled.

558
01:24:52,671 --> 01:24:54,922
But I might have
underestimated this one.

559
01:24:55,424 --> 01:24:58,718
I was told
you never make that kind of mistake.

560
01:24:59,845 --> 01:25:02,096
What will you do?
- Wait.

561
01:25:02,598 --> 01:25:08,561
Then what? - People who move
leave word of change of adress.

562
01:25:09,062 --> 01:25:11,689
I want to see that report.
- Do you know him?

563
01:25:12,191 --> 01:25:14,400
Professionally, yes.
- He kills people!

564
01:25:15,611 --> 01:25:16,611
Yes.

565
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:21,157
He works for the Company?
- Did once. He's a contract agent.

566
01:25:21,658 --> 01:25:24,994
Freelance.
Where did you see him?

567
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:31,918
It would help if I knew.
- Help who?

568
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,755
Who'd hire him now?
- Anybody. - Terrific answer!

569
01:25:37,424 --> 01:25:39,258
I know.
- What's his name?

570
01:25:39,760 --> 01:25:42,011
When I knew him, Joubert.

571
01:25:42,513 --> 01:25:46,933
Who'd hire him? You don't look him up
in the Yellow Pages! - Right.

572
01:25:47,434 --> 01:25:50,561
Have to be somebody in the Community.
- Community?

573
01:25:51,063 --> 01:25:56,484
Intelligence field. - "Community"?
You guys are kind to yourselves!

574
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:02,406
I want to see that report. - It went
to headquarters and disappeared.

575
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:06,285
Who read it?
- You mean besides Wicks?

576
01:26:07,871 --> 01:26:09,956
You tell me.

577
01:26:13,085 --> 01:26:17,630
I pick up traces of an intelligence
network the company doesn't know.

578
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:23,177
And I report it. Now why is that
going to make anybody mad?

579
01:26:23,637 --> 01:26:28,057
Unless it was the Company's network
and you didn't want it blown!

580
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:31,435
Somebody is lying, Higgins.

581
01:26:31,937 --> 01:26:37,149
Come on. Why is everybody so shy?

582
01:26:37,651 --> 01:26:40,152
I'm not shy.

583
01:26:41,405 --> 01:26:44,574
I don't know. That's what worries me.

584
01:26:45,868 --> 01:26:49,453
I don't know.
- Ask Wicks. - Wicks died.

585
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:57,128
Someone yanked him off the
life-support system at the hospital.

586
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:09,432
Get me in, Higgins.

587
01:27:11,852 --> 01:27:16,480
What good would that do, if they are
inside, what good would that do?

588
01:27:18,817 --> 01:27:20,192
What should I do?

589
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:24,405
I'm sorry.

590
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:36,083
You're sorry?

591
01:27:39,922 --> 01:27:41,339
I get it.

592
01:27:43,342 --> 01:27:46,302
You expect me to draw fire!

593
01:27:46,803 --> 01:27:52,892
Like a penny arcade bear parading
back and forth waiting for somebody!

594
01:27:53,393 --> 01:27:56,562
And you'll pick him up
before he does it, or after?

595
01:27:57,064 --> 01:27:59,690
I'm gonna cross-check all the names.

596
01:28:00,192 --> 01:28:03,903
Nice talking to you, Higgins.
- Wait, where will I find you?

597
01:28:05,030 --> 01:28:05,988
I'll find you.

598
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:16,874
Do you trust him?

599
01:28:17,501 --> 01:28:20,211
Trust...
- Does he trust you?

600
01:28:20,712 --> 01:28:25,174
He can't trust anybody. - How could
anybody sneak in and fool them?

601
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:28,010
Maybe nobody did. - Then...

602
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:31,263
Maybe there's another CIA...

603
01:28:32,391 --> 01:28:33,975
...inside the CIA.

604
01:29:00,293 --> 01:29:02,211
The light's gone off!

605
01:29:09,845 --> 01:29:12,513
It's a hotel room.
- What hotel?

606
01:29:13,015 --> 01:29:18,185
There's no tag. It's Room 819 in New
York. - There's a code on the edge.

607
01:29:18,687 --> 01:29:20,563
You in the trade?

608
01:29:21,064 --> 01:29:23,983
I read about it in a story.
- A story about locksmiths?

609
01:29:24,484 --> 01:29:27,737
The lock manufacturer
can give you the name of the hotel.

610
01:29:28,238 --> 01:29:30,823
I don't want to read
about you in the newspapers.

611
01:29:31,324 --> 01:29:33,659
Will you make the call?

612
01:30:14,284 --> 01:30:16,077
I'm doing a survey.

613
01:30:17,120 --> 01:30:20,039
Do you believe the condor
is an endangered species?

614
01:30:41,478 --> 01:30:43,729
Your room number, please.
- 819.

615
01:30:50,278 --> 01:30:53,280
I just had an interesting call.
- Who is this?

616
01:30:53,782 --> 01:30:57,076
In reference to
an all but extinct bird, the condor.

617
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:00,037
Have you had such a call?
- You're a fool to call me here!

618
01:31:00,539 --> 01:31:02,998
You had no such call?
- No.

619
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:08,379
Must have been the Audubon Society.
They're still in New York City.

620
01:31:13,218 --> 01:31:16,637
Langley, Computer.
State your program at the tone.

621
01:31:17,139 --> 01:31:20,182
G... Carriage return.

622
01:31:21,351 --> 01:31:25,354
TRS. Tone, symbol for number.

623
01:31:27,023 --> 01:31:29,108
Computer is ready.

624
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:43,581
That number is 202-227-0098.

625
01:31:59,973 --> 01:32:01,390
CNA, Mrs. Coleman.

626
01:32:02,100 --> 01:32:06,020
Harold Thomas, Customer Service
requesting a CNA on...

627
01:32:06,521 --> 01:32:11,984
...202-227-0098.

628
01:32:12,485 --> 01:32:14,111
One moment please.

629
01:32:16,865 --> 01:32:18,032
That would be

630
01:32:18,533 --> 01:32:23,954
Mr. Leonard Atwood, 365 Mackenzie PI.,
Chevy Chase, Maryland.

631
01:32:59,574 --> 01:33:04,954
Cross-check this tape against Wicks
and hold for any intersects.

632
01:33:16,508 --> 01:33:17,716
Hat size...

633
01:33:24,266 --> 01:33:25,683
"Lucifer"...

634
01:33:26,393 --> 01:33:28,811
- Alright, run "Lucifer".

635
01:33:51,584 --> 01:33:55,296
I'll be damned.

636
01:34:47,432 --> 01:34:51,435
This is the Major.
- Condor. Find me Higgins.

637
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,147
Routing you, Condor. Stand by.

638
01:35:00,070 --> 01:35:01,111
Hello, Condor.

639
01:35:01,613 --> 01:35:05,115
Holiday Inn, 57th Street.
- Is that where you are?

640
01:35:05,617 --> 01:35:11,038
Room 819. If you move it, you'll find
the Alsatian. - Where are you?

641
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:15,751
Where are you, Condor?
- Quiet down...

642
01:35:17,253 --> 01:35:18,170
Higgins?

643
01:35:19,005 --> 01:35:20,923
Yeah, I'm right here.

644
01:35:22,133 --> 01:35:23,467
Who is Atwood?

645
01:35:33,269 --> 01:35:34,603
Where are you, Higgins?

646
01:35:39,734 --> 01:35:42,277
Aren't we pals anymore?

647
01:35:44,572 --> 01:35:45,697
Something?

648
01:35:46,616 --> 01:35:48,367
Major?
- Got him!

649
01:35:49,202 --> 01:35:50,869
Let me see that.

650
01:35:53,039 --> 01:35:54,623
What's he doing in Brooklyn?

651
01:35:56,918 --> 01:35:59,420
We can get...
- Wait!

652
01:36:07,262 --> 01:36:10,973
What's going on? - The son of a bitch
wired together 50 phones!

653
01:36:11,474 --> 01:36:14,852
What? - Everybody in Brooklyn
is talking to each other!

654
01:36:33,746 --> 01:36:38,459
I didn't know you smoked.
- I quit three years ago.

655
01:36:39,502 --> 01:36:42,379
You look pale.
- It's the light in here.

656
01:36:46,926 --> 01:36:48,927
What will you do there?

657
01:36:50,013 --> 01:36:52,431
See a guy.
- More secrets...

658
01:36:52,891 --> 01:36:55,142
Like those pictures you hide.

659
01:36:56,269 --> 01:36:57,352
Yes...

660
01:36:58,688 --> 01:37:02,024
Someday I'd like to show them to you.

661
01:37:03,443 --> 01:37:05,986
If you live through this.

662
01:37:06,988 --> 01:37:09,239
You could drive me to Washington.

663
01:37:15,830 --> 01:37:17,122
No.

664
01:37:22,962 --> 01:37:27,132
You have a lot of very fine qualities.

665
01:37:27,634 --> 01:37:30,677
But...
- What fine qualities?

666
01:37:39,437 --> 01:37:41,772
You have good eyes.

667
01:37:43,066 --> 01:37:46,944
Not kind, but they don't lie,

668
01:37:47,445 --> 01:37:51,740
and they don't look away much
and they don't miss anything.

669
01:37:54,494 --> 01:37:57,162
I could use eyes like that.

670
01:37:58,873 --> 01:38:00,666
You're overdue in Vermont.

671
01:38:07,257 --> 01:38:09,424
Is he a tough guy?

672
01:38:10,843 --> 01:38:12,844
He's pretty tough...

673
01:38:14,597 --> 01:38:19,560
What will he do?
- Understand. Probably.

674
01:38:21,646 --> 01:38:23,021
Boy...

675
01:38:23,523 --> 01:38:25,232
That is tough.

676
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:31,196
All aboard for Baltimore
and Washington D. C...!

677
01:38:34,617 --> 01:38:37,452
Kathy... I need time.

678
01:38:39,038 --> 01:38:43,375
Eight hours or so, that's all.
Till noon, to do what I have to do.

679
01:38:44,127 --> 01:38:47,254
Do you understand what I'm saying?
- No.

680
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:49,631
Are you going right to Vermont?

681
01:38:51,884 --> 01:38:52,968
Yes.

682
01:38:54,804 --> 01:38:57,306
What I mean is, don't call anyone.

683
01:38:59,475 --> 01:39:01,852
Don't stop, please.

684
01:39:02,812 --> 01:39:04,938
Don't tell anyone about...

685
01:39:16,826 --> 01:39:19,703
Jesus, I didn't...

686
01:39:26,085 --> 01:39:29,630
Hey, you take care of yourself.
- I'll do my best.

687
01:39:32,133 --> 01:39:33,550
Do your best.

688
01:39:43,061 --> 01:39:46,730
Why aren't you further along?
- With the Company, sir?

689
01:39:47,231 --> 01:39:50,525
You seem perfect for it.

690
01:39:52,195 --> 01:39:55,030
Are you perfect for it, Mr. Higgins?

691
01:39:56,324 --> 01:39:57,783
I try to be, sir.

692
01:39:58,576 --> 01:40:03,830
You were recruited out of school?
- No, interviewed in Korea.

693
01:40:04,749 --> 01:40:07,793
You served with
Colonel Donovan in the OSS?

694
01:40:08,294 --> 01:40:13,298
I sailed the Adriatic
with a movie star at the helm.

695
01:40:13,800 --> 01:40:18,387
It doesn't seem like
much of a war now, but it was.

696
01:40:18,888 --> 01:40:21,014
I go even further back than that.

697
01:40:21,516 --> 01:40:25,936
Ten years after the Great War,
as we used to call it

698
01:40:26,437 --> 01:40:28,814
before we knew enough to number them.

699
01:40:29,982 --> 01:40:32,734
Do you miss that kind of action?
- No.

700
01:40:34,445 --> 01:40:37,364
I miss that kind of clarity.

701
01:40:41,202 --> 01:40:42,285
Yes?

702
01:40:44,539 --> 01:40:45,664
Thank you.

703
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:49,918
He's being held at New York Center.

704
01:40:56,801 --> 01:41:00,470
Mr. Higgins, you do understand
the Company's position?

705
01:41:03,057 --> 01:41:06,393
There's nothing in the way
of your doing this, is there?

706
01:41:49,103 --> 01:41:52,647
What is this? What's going on?

707
01:42:11,209 --> 01:42:24,304
Who are you?

708
01:42:24,806 --> 01:42:26,431
What are you doing here?

709
01:42:28,226 --> 01:42:29,935
I'm Condor.

710
01:42:33,606 --> 01:42:35,106
Sit down.

711
01:42:36,692 --> 01:42:38,693
What do you do for a living?

712
01:42:39,403 --> 01:42:41,947
Don't be ridiculous.

713
01:42:43,074 --> 01:42:44,574
What do you do...

714
01:42:45,576 --> 01:42:46,993
...exactly?

715
01:42:49,705 --> 01:42:53,208
Deputy Director of Operations.

716
01:42:53,709 --> 01:42:56,753
What section?
- Middle East.

717
01:42:59,674 --> 01:43:01,508
What are you working on?

718
01:43:03,970 --> 01:43:05,554
What are you doing?

719
01:43:07,390 --> 01:43:11,226
What's the secret worth murdering
everybody at the A.L.H.S.?

720
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:15,105
There's no secret.
- Wicks showed you my report.

721
01:43:15,606 --> 01:43:16,523
Yes.

722
01:43:22,488 --> 01:43:24,406
It was your network I turned up.

723
01:43:27,952 --> 01:43:32,539
Doing what?

724
01:43:33,666 --> 01:43:38,253
What does Operations care about
a bunch of books, a book in Dutch?

725
01:43:39,881 --> 01:43:41,756
A book out of Venezuela...

726
01:43:42,592 --> 01:43:43,800
Mystery stories in Arabic.

727
01:43:44,302 --> 01:43:47,012
What is so important about...

728
01:43:52,894 --> 01:43:54,436
...oil fields?

729
01:43:58,608 --> 01:43:59,649
Oil...

730
01:44:12,538 --> 01:44:14,331
That's it, isn't it?

731
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:22,547
This whole damn thing was about oil!

732
01:44:23,925 --> 01:44:25,759
Wasn't it?

733
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,054
Yes, it was.

734
01:44:30,640 --> 01:44:31,848
Don't turn around.

735
01:44:33,267 --> 01:44:35,352
Put your thumb on the hammer.

736
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:43,360
Release it slowly.

737
01:44:46,739 --> 01:44:48,615
Set down the gun on the desk.

738
01:44:55,331 --> 01:44:56,706
Don't move.

739
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:18,478
You were quite good, until this.

740
01:45:22,316 --> 01:45:25,151
This move was predictable.

741
01:45:49,468 --> 01:45:50,427
What?

742
01:45:53,764 --> 01:45:55,849
Did you touch anything else?

743
01:45:58,394 --> 01:46:00,228
You're working for the Company again!

744
01:46:01,355 --> 01:46:03,815
The desk? The lamp?

745
01:46:05,735 --> 01:46:08,194
Jesus, they took you back!

746
01:46:09,405 --> 01:46:12,073
Just for this. For Atwood.

747
01:46:14,118 --> 01:46:17,454
He's with the Company! Why...?

748
01:46:18,581 --> 01:46:24,169
I'm not interested in "why", more in
"when", sometimes "where".

749
01:46:24,670 --> 01:46:26,421
Always "how much".

750
01:46:27,715 --> 01:46:30,633
I suspect
he was becoming an embarassment.

751
01:46:32,553 --> 01:46:33,553
As you are.

752
01:46:41,604 --> 01:46:44,272
So you're not finished?
- Pardon?

753
01:46:44,774 --> 01:46:48,193
Oh, no, I had no arrangement
with the Company concerning you.

754
01:46:48,694 --> 01:46:52,197
They didn't know you would be here.
I knew you would.

755
01:46:57,244 --> 01:46:58,745
Didn't you send the mailman?

756
01:46:59,955 --> 01:47:02,749
That was a business
arrangement with Atwood.

757
01:47:03,250 --> 01:47:04,793
But you see...

758
01:47:11,634 --> 01:47:12,884
Come on.

759
01:47:56,303 --> 01:47:58,513
Tell me about the girl.

760
01:48:01,725 --> 01:48:03,852
What about the girl?

761
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:07,689
She was chosen... how?

762
01:48:08,816 --> 01:48:14,237
By age? Her car? Appearance?
- At random.

763
01:48:15,447 --> 01:48:17,740
Chance.
- Really...?

764
01:48:21,787 --> 01:48:24,038
Can I drop you?

765
01:48:29,295 --> 01:48:31,880
I'd like to go back to New York.

766
01:48:34,592 --> 01:48:37,093
You have not much future there.

767
01:48:42,892 --> 01:48:44,475
It will happen this way:

768
01:48:45,895 --> 01:48:47,395
You may be walking,

769
01:48:49,106 --> 01:48:52,650
maybe the first sunny day of spring.

770
01:48:53,736 --> 01:48:56,237
And a car will slow beside you,

771
01:48:56,739 --> 01:49:01,451
and a door will open
and someone you know, even trust,

772
01:49:01,952 --> 01:49:03,453
will get out.

773
01:49:05,664 --> 01:49:09,042
And he will smile. A becoming smile.

774
01:49:11,003 --> 01:49:13,588
But he will leave open the car door

775
01:49:15,716 --> 01:49:18,218
and offer to give you a lift.

776
01:49:24,058 --> 01:49:27,143
You seem to understand it all so well.

777
01:49:29,438 --> 01:49:30,980
What would you suggest?

778
01:49:32,233 --> 01:49:36,986
Personally, I'd prefer Europe.
- Europe? - Yes.

779
01:49:38,113 --> 01:49:43,076
The fact is,
what I do is not a bad occupation.

780
01:49:43,577 --> 01:49:46,454
Someone is always willing to pay.

781
01:49:50,584 --> 01:49:52,085
I would find it...

782
01:49:53,921 --> 01:49:58,675
...tiring. - Oh, no, it's
quite restful. It's almost peaceful.

783
01:49:59,718 --> 01:50:02,845
No need to believe in either side,
or any side.

784
01:50:03,347 --> 01:50:07,684
There is no cause.
There's only yourself.

785
01:50:08,560 --> 01:50:10,603
The belief is in your own precision.

786
01:50:16,819 --> 01:50:19,487
I was born in the US, Joubert.

787
01:50:21,782 --> 01:50:24,701
I miss it when I'm away too long.

788
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:27,078
A pity.

789
01:50:29,623 --> 01:50:31,291
I don't think so.

790
01:50:34,878 --> 01:50:36,838
Can you drop me at the station?

791
01:50:37,339 --> 01:50:40,300
It would be my pleasure.

792
01:50:49,518 --> 01:50:51,144
For that day.

793
01:51:11,749 --> 01:51:12,582
Higgins!

794
01:51:34,980 --> 01:51:38,066
Why do call so late?
We were worried. - Likewise.

795
01:51:38,567 --> 01:51:42,779
Is the car for me? - Yeah, it's safe.
You have a few hours of debriefing.

796
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:52,121
Let's say for the purposes of
argument, I had a.45 in my pocket,

797
01:51:54,249 --> 01:51:56,834
you'd take a walk with me, right?

798
01:51:58,879 --> 01:52:00,338
Which way?

799
01:52:01,298 --> 01:52:04,175
West. Slowly.

800
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:07,303
Stay in front of me 3 or 4 steps.

801
01:52:16,105 --> 01:52:17,647
Where are we going?

802
01:52:19,274 --> 01:52:21,109
Wave them on ahead.

803
01:52:31,245 --> 01:52:34,205
Do we have plans
to invade the Middle East?

804
01:52:34,706 --> 01:52:37,500
Are you crazy?
- Am I?

805
01:52:38,001 --> 01:52:41,254
Do we have plans?
- No, absolutely not.

806
01:52:41,839 --> 01:52:44,048
We have games. That's all.

807
01:52:44,550 --> 01:52:49,887
We play games. What if?
How many men? What would it take?

808
01:52:50,389 --> 01:52:52,765
How can we destabilize a regime?

809
01:52:53,267 --> 01:52:56,936
That's what we're paid to do.
- Walk on.

810
01:52:57,604 --> 01:52:58,771
Go on.

811
01:53:03,235 --> 01:53:07,989
So Atwood just took the games too
seriously. He was really gonna do it.

812
01:53:08,490 --> 01:53:14,704
Renegade operation. There was no way.
Not with the heat on the Company.

813
01:53:15,205 --> 01:53:20,293
What if there hadn't been any heat?
What if I hadn't stumbled on the plan?

814
01:53:21,420 --> 01:53:26,174
Different ball game.
There was nothing wrong with the plan.

815
01:53:26,675 --> 01:53:30,428
The plan was alright.
The plan would've worked.

816
01:53:31,555 --> 01:53:33,514
What is it with you people?

817
01:53:34,016 --> 01:53:37,143
You think not getting caught lying
is the same as telling the truth?

818
01:53:37,728 --> 01:53:39,979
No. It's simple economics.

819
01:53:40,481 --> 01:53:42,064
Today, its oil.

820
01:53:42,566 --> 01:53:46,944
In 10 or 15 years it'll be food,
plutonium. Maybe even sooner.

821
01:53:47,446 --> 01:53:50,656
What do you think the people
will want us to do then?

822
01:53:52,117 --> 01:53:54,160
Ask them.
- Not now, then.

823
01:53:54,661 --> 01:53:56,245
Ask them when they're running out.

824
01:53:56,872 --> 01:54:01,167
Ask them when there's no heating.
When their engines stop.

825
01:54:01,668 --> 01:54:04,712
When people who've never
known hunger go hungry.

826
01:54:05,214 --> 01:54:10,134
They won't want us to ask them,
they'll just want us to get it.

827
01:54:11,762 --> 01:54:12,762
Boy...

828
01:54:13,889 --> 01:54:16,516
...have you found a home!

829
01:54:18,143 --> 01:54:20,394
7 people were killed.
- The Company didn't order it!

830
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:23,814
Atwood did.

831
01:54:25,234 --> 01:54:27,652
And who is Atwood?
He's all you guys.

832
01:54:28,153 --> 01:54:32,281
7 people killed.
And you play fucking games!

833
01:54:32,783 --> 01:54:36,410
Right.
And the other side does too.

834
01:54:36,912 --> 01:54:39,330
That's why we can't
let you stay outside.

835
01:54:39,790 --> 01:54:41,249
Go on home.

836
01:54:41,750 --> 01:54:44,544
Go on. They've got it.

837
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:48,422
Just look around.
That's where they ship from.

838
01:54:50,467 --> 01:54:51,926
They've got all of it.

839
01:55:02,104 --> 01:55:03,688
What did you do?

840
01:55:04,189 --> 01:55:10,152
I told them a story.
You play games. I told them a story.

841
01:55:20,289 --> 01:55:23,332
Oh, you poor dumb son of a bitch!

842
01:55:23,834 --> 01:55:26,294
You've done more damage than you know.

843
01:55:28,547 --> 01:55:29,755
I hope so.

844
01:55:38,307 --> 01:55:40,349
You'll be a very lonely man.

845
01:55:44,479 --> 01:55:48,316
It didn't have to end this way.
- If course it did.

846
01:55:54,448 --> 01:55:57,450
How do you know they'll print it?

847
01:55:58,619 --> 01:56:03,372
You can take a walk
but how far if they don't print it?

848
01:56:04,166 --> 01:56:06,167
They'll print it.

849
01:56:07,252 --> 01:56:08,669
How do you know?

850
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:55,216
