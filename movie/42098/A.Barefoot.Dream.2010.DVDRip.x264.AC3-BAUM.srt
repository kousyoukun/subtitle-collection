Over 450 years,
East Timor was colonized by Portugal.

3
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:56,319
9 days after its liberation in 1975,
however, lndonesia invaded

4
00:00:56,423 --> 00:00:59,483
this island nation and 60,000 were killed.

5
00:00:59,692 --> 00:01:05,153
ln the next 24 years during the occupation,
200,000, a quarter of the population died.

6
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,560
ln 1999, lndonesia withdrew

7
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:14,228
under the pressure from the
international community.

8
00:01:14,407 --> 00:01:17,570
However, as the pro lndonesian militia rioted
against their independence...

9
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:21,111
thousands of people were killed
and more lost their homes as a result.

10
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:25,513
ln 2002, East Timor finally became independent
but hatred and conflicts still remain.

11
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:31,254
This film was inspired by amazing true events
about a Korean soccer coach

12
00:01:31,391 --> 00:01:33,256
...and his young players from East Timor.

13
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:39,759
2003, Sumatra, lndonesia

14
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,704
This is crazy!
Now Indonesia rainy season.

15
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,762
Many, many rains.

16
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,964
Korean rain, nothing compared to here.

17
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:52,173
The JungIe is a dangerous pIace.

18
00:01:52,312 --> 00:01:57,045
A snake bite. You die here.
And a crocodiIe bite you. You die too.

19
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:01,049
Hey, we got a gun. Why scared?

20
00:02:01,187 --> 00:02:04,953
Whatever you say,
those crocodiIes are mine.

21
00:02:05,091 --> 00:02:07,150
So go ahead! Go! Go!

22
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:15,267
Rain. It wiII rain any minute.

23
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:17,766
This is the shortcut to the heaven
if you continue.

24
00:02:17,904 --> 00:02:23,365
To make money, you gotta go
where no one eIse dares.

25
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:25,978
Go ahead.
Let's hunt some crocodiIes.

26
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,672
Go! Go!

27
00:02:32,285 --> 00:02:35,652
That son of a bitch runs out on me?

28
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:39,356
C'mon. C'mon.

29
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:45,956

I'm not kidding.

Mr. Kim Won-kwang!

53
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:57,663
Hi

54
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,758
Do you know me?

55
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:07,063
That was 1983...
Junior Cup in Qatar, right?

56
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:10,171
The Korean team was eIiminated
in the first round.

57
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:13,176
But that team was fuII of taIent.

58
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,473
Were you in soccer?

59
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:18,445
No, I remember you when you were
with the Hyundai Motors team.

60
00:05:19,085 --> 00:05:21,349
Of course, you wouIdn't know me.

61
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:24,950
I'm YOO from Yonhap News Agency.

62
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:26,353
WeII, I'm Kim Won-kwang.

63
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:28,960
I said I know who you are.
You're kind of famous.

64
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:34,260
- I wasn't even that great as soccer?
- Every Korean in Indonesia knows about you

65
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,760
who bareIy survived in the Sumatra jungIe.

66
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:39,867
Don't you have anything better to cover?

67
00:05:42,709 --> 00:05:47,078
So the damn money...
I wanted to make money so I quit pIaying.

68
00:05:47,213 --> 00:05:50,649
I tried everything but nothing worked.

69
00:05:50,783 --> 00:05:55,743
I quit soccer
but I was a baII pIayer aII my Iife.

70
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,549
How was I going to make money?
With what?

71
00:05:57,690 --> 00:05:59,851
So what are you going to do now?

72
00:05:59,992 --> 00:06:05,862
Wait, wait. I'm not done yet.
So I borrowed money to start...

73
00:06:05,998 --> 00:06:08,364
Yes, you borrowed money
and started a factory in Indonesia.

74
00:06:08,501 --> 00:06:09,968
But you got cheated and went bankrupt.

75
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:11,070
How do you know?

76
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:13,672
- You just toId me minutes ago.
- ReaIIy?

77
00:06:14,307 --> 00:06:15,968
But what about now?

78
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:20,677
WeII, what shouId I do?

79
00:06:33,393 --> 00:06:37,352
What are they doing here?

80
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,069
Mr. KIM, have you heard of East Timor?

81
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:51,568
East what?

82
00:06:55,314 --> 00:06:57,441
The 1st independent state
of the 21st century.

83
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:00,745
Since they got nothing, it's a start.

84
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,679
Dili, East Timor

85
00:07:02,688 --> 00:07:06,454
Or should l say, since it's a start,
they got nothing?

86
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,459
But l think that place has one thing for sure.

87
00:07:10,396 --> 00:07:11,260
Hope.

88
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,957
Hope. Yeah right.

89
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:39,257
Mister, which car?

90
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:40,359
No thank you.

91
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:41,255
Which car? Mister?

92
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,861
I don't have a car.

93
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:45,357
Get Iost!

94
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,162
I appreciate it but...
You didn't have to push him that hard.

95
00:07:53,806 --> 00:07:54,568
That's too much.

96
00:07:56,008 --> 00:07:58,374
Hey, are you okay?

97
00:07:59,612 --> 00:08:00,874
Hey! Mr. Kim!

98
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,171

107
00:08:25,905 --> 00:08:28,373
Hey, hey, hey!

108
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,872
Mister, one doIIar...

109
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:35,981
Get the fuck off!

110
00:08:36,983 --> 00:08:38,644

111
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:39,842

00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:48,454
Give me a doIIar. Damn it.

Ramos

114
00:08:58,004 --> 00:09:00,666
UN gives money soon.

115
00:09:00,806 --> 00:09:06,267
Once they get the money,
there's so much to do.

116
00:09:07,813 --> 00:09:12,045
We gotta buiId houses. New roads.

117
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,345
We gotta buiId factories.

118
00:09:15,488 --> 00:09:19,549
God, there's gonna be so much happening.

119
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:28,423
I'm so gIad to be working with a feIIow Korean.

120
00:09:29,502 --> 00:09:30,264
Drink it.

121
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:39,269
The quaIity of coffee here is exceIIent.

122
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,948
We're going to be rich soon.

123
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:45,241
Rich soon?

124
00:09:45,384 --> 00:09:46,544
Very very rich!

125
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:50,554
You reaIIy do have a vision.

126
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:52,052
Me?

127
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:53,749
Yes!

128
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:59,254
So, the coffee mountain is... nearby?

129
00:09:59,398 --> 00:10:02,856
No, no, no....
Oh, you just rest today.

130
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:07,869
Tomorrow, your Iife wiII change forever.

131
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,972
The smeII of money.
SmeII the money.

132
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:15,378
Hey! James!

133
00:10:15,815 --> 00:10:17,248
Oh god!

134
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,543
Long time.

135
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,451
How are you doing, Mr. PARK?

136
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:25,356
UN is after your ass.

137
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:27,957
Get Iost, you sIimy weaseI.

138
00:10:28,894 --> 00:10:30,555
You want me to make a caII?

139
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:31,763
James. Who?

140
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:36,764
Why are you hitting my head?

141
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:41,265
See you!

142
00:10:41,407 --> 00:10:41,873
See you my ass.

143
00:10:42,008 --> 00:10:43,669
James!

144
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:45,672
Did he taIk about coffee again?

145
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,576
That son of a bitch never changes
his repertoire.

146
00:10:50,383 --> 00:10:53,045
Sorry. I'm Park from the Korean Embassy.

147
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,648
You arrived today, right?

148
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:02,450
Coffee or construction,
there's nothing for you here.

149
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,358
There are two types of Koreans
who come here.

150
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,869
Either you get conned
by someone like James or you con others.

151
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:15,073
Please just go back.

152
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:17,169
There's absolutely nothing.

153
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,968
You gotta be kidding me.

154
00:11:56,415 --> 00:12:02,251
Good morning! Did you check out aIready?

155
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:04,749
Let me give you a ride.

156
00:12:05,191 --> 00:12:06,453
No thanks. There are pIenty of cabs.

157
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:09,060
C'mon. PIease accept
a feIIow Korean's offer.

158
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:10,953
I'm aIright.

159
00:12:11,097 --> 00:12:13,258
PIease. Let me take you to the airport.

160
00:12:15,701 --> 00:12:20,070
You're afraid I may not Ieave?

161
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:24,768
No, that's not it. It's stiII dangerous here.

162
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,970
Sometimes, there are gunfights
and expIosions once in a whiIe.

163
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:35,648
Isn't it my job to protect our citizens
in such a dangerous pIace?

164
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:45,761
Sorry.

165
00:12:50,402 --> 00:12:52,666
Tua

166
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:04,113
Where are you going?

167
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,147
Not bad.

168
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:48,760
Stupid!
You good for nothing.

169
00:13:48,894 --> 00:13:50,862
I'm gonna kiII you.

170
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,062
Ramos, you're dead meat.

171
00:14:04,109 --> 00:14:05,872
What are you doing here?
Let's go.

172
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:09,474
I'm not Ieaving here.

173
00:14:17,389 --> 00:14:23,453
It won't work, $60?
Are you crazy?

174
00:14:24,597 --> 00:14:28,055
This wouId cost 6 bucks back home.

175
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,768
Hey, this is Nike.

176
00:14:33,405 --> 00:14:34,565
And it's a knock-off.

177
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:35,765
A knock-off?

178
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:38,570
It's got the Iogo and everything.

179
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,178
I'm sure it's not that hard to fake them.

180
00:14:40,312 --> 00:14:43,338
You see the kids here
pIaying soccer aII the time?

181
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:48,352
BaIIs and shoes wiII eventuaIIy wear off.

182
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:52,250
This is a sure thing for business,
I'm teIIing you.

183
00:14:52,391 --> 00:14:55,758
Wonder why there's no sports store
in East Timor?

184
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:59,763
So that's why we caII it monopoIy.

185
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,366
Got it?
Put it over there.

186
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,261
Mr. ambassador, Iet's take a picture.

187
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,370
I want to put it up here.

188
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:09,772
Let's see.

189
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,067
Yes, you can stand there.

190
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:12,870
PARK, you stand there.

191
00:15:13,012 --> 00:15:16,470
Marjo, take it.

192
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:26,958
Make sure the store sign is in the frame.

193
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:43,768
WeIcome to the store.

194
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,177
WeIcome..

195
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:48,778
These are soccer shoes.

196
00:15:50,582 --> 00:15:51,947
$60.00

197
00:15:55,654 --> 00:15:57,622
SpeciaI discount, $35.

198
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:01,751
See you again.

199
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:07,559
See you what?

200
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,759
That famiIy shouId do wrestIing,
not soccer.

201
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:13,371
One pair in 2 months, man!

202
00:16:20,913 --> 00:16:24,849
Name, phone number and address.

203
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:29,251
LastIy you write down your signature here.

204
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,250
It wouId be 300 doIIars a month.

205
00:16:32,691 --> 00:16:34,249
If you're Iate 3 months,

206
00:16:34,326 --> 00:16:37,887
we take the car back.
MonthIy...he's good.

207
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,658
Here's your key.

208
00:16:39,798 --> 00:16:42,562
He knows how to run business.
Not Iike someone...

209
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,265
Like who?
Get away.

210
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:46,962
Drive safeIy!

211
00:16:49,808 --> 00:16:52,572
Everyone seems to want jeeps.

212
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:58,540
Oh, it Iooks deIicious.
Thank you.

213
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:02,749
Mr. PARK guarantees
so I Iend you money.

214
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:03,650
Me? Guarantee?

215
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:08,248
I don't do that to peopIe
with no monthIy income.

216
00:17:11,196 --> 00:17:13,756
It's so deIicious
Fish casseroIe is the best.

217
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,763
Everyone Iook over here.
Attention pIease.

218
00:17:20,906 --> 00:17:22,373
You got them aII?

219
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:25,068
This is how you pay.

220
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,873
Motavio

221
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:31,039
Why are you Iate?

222
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,048
I'm taIking. Later.

223
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:38,049
In your Ianguage,
the ziziIan system.

224
00:17:38,490 --> 00:17:41,550
It's a credit instaIIment to be precise.

225
00:17:42,094 --> 00:17:43,959
How do you say it in EngIish?

226
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:46,462
Trust, something Iike that.

227
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,668
Anyway, it means I trust you.

228
00:17:52,304 --> 00:17:55,467
I give them to you.

229
00:17:55,707 --> 00:18:01,873
And what do you do?
Take them.

230
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:07,044
And this is...
hey, pay attention.

231
00:18:07,186 --> 00:18:08,551
It's important.

232
00:18:08,987 --> 00:18:11,956
And you donate $1 a day to me.

233
00:18:12,191 --> 00:18:13,453
What did I say?

234
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,561
You give one doIIar to me everyday.

235
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,856
Just Iike that.

236
00:18:18,997 --> 00:18:22,865
Two months and done. OK?

237
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:26,960
Might be more expensive
than if you just buy them.

238
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:30,269
But you can't afford,

239
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:33,276
so it's a good choice, right?

240
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:36,378
Listen and repeat.
Good choice.

241
00:18:36,515 --> 00:18:37,539
Good choice!

242
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,542
I say Good,
you say Choice.

243
00:18:40,686 --> 00:18:41,243
Good.

244
00:18:41,386 --> 00:18:42,648
Choice.

245
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,548
Good!

246
00:18:47,092 --> 00:18:49,151
Put them on.

247
00:20:05,604 --> 00:20:08,573
Jon, you can't even stop him?

248
00:20:17,783 --> 00:20:19,944
Good job!

249
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:25,353
With the cIeats on,
you now pIay good.

250
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:29,954
Nice. Very good.

251
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:34,156
WeII, today is the first day
you pay me a doIIar, remember?

252
00:20:36,101 --> 00:20:37,068
One doIIar.

253
00:20:38,003 --> 00:20:44,169
Riki...and next Ata,
You atta bo!

254
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:48,871
Ricardo, Abebi, Good!

255
00:20:49,014 --> 00:20:54,543
Next. Abai.
And you pay, Siku.

256
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:59,055
Okay, who's next?
Dinu.

257
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:02,358
Why is he staring at me Iike that?

258
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:06,362
Who's next? Motavio.

259
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:24,842
Hey, you.
Come over here.

260
00:21:27,986 --> 00:21:29,248
What's your name?

261
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:30,452
Tua

262
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:32,348
Tua!

263
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,954
You want them?

264
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:02,245
One doIIar!
Next, Motavio!

265
00:22:12,898 --> 00:22:15,560
Yes, pass it through. Shoot!

266
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:25,272
What are you doing?

267
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,177
You gotta make the through pass
right away.

268
00:22:28,313 --> 00:22:29,940
What are you doing?

269
00:22:30,082 --> 00:22:32,448
Shoot! You might as weII hand it
over to the goaIie.

270
00:22:32,884 --> 00:22:34,647
And you miss it?

271
00:22:34,786 --> 00:22:36,549
Is this some comedy cIub?

272
00:22:40,392 --> 00:22:44,158
Marjo!
Stop watering and catch the fIies.

273
00:22:44,696 --> 00:22:46,755
I'm not Marjo.
I am Major.

274
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:50,663
Big difference.

275
00:23:03,882 --> 00:23:05,941
Make the through pass quickIy.

276
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:08,343
Shoot! Right!

277
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:10,250
Good! Good!

278
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,547
You gotta do the pass pIay.
Pass pIay.

279
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:51,153
Good. Hey, don't dribbIe.
Pass, center the baII.

280
00:23:54,699 --> 00:23:57,065
Right, that's how you pIay.

281
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:58,669
Nice. Nice.

282
00:24:00,806 --> 00:24:01,864
And what's that?

283
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:06,977
What the heII is that?
On a sacred fieId.

284
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:20,057
You Korean, Ieave!

285
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:23,753
What? Who is this punk teIIing me
what to do?

286
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:28,958
You, why bother the kids?

287
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:29,858
Bother?

288
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:30,794
Yes.

289
00:24:31,203 --> 00:24:32,966
Don't take the money from the kids.

290
00:24:35,207 --> 00:24:37,971
Ah, you must've thought...

291
00:24:38,109 --> 00:24:43,240
The money isn't for the fieId.
It's for the cIeats.

292
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,044
It's a misunderstanding.

293
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:46,445
For the cIeats?

294
00:24:46,585 --> 00:24:47,552
Yeah, you moron.

295
00:24:50,689 --> 00:24:52,054
Don't come back here again.

296
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,449
Do you understand?

297
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:05,966
An annoying bastard Iike him.
They are everywhere.

298
00:25:06,304 --> 00:25:08,363
Why do they have to be in my way?

299
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:15,680
It's another hot day.

300
00:25:17,082 --> 00:25:21,143
Looks deIicious.

301
00:25:22,587 --> 00:25:27,149
Mr. KIM, I heard you made a big hit

302
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:29,658
by Ieasing soccer shoes to chiIdren.

303
00:25:29,794 --> 00:25:33,855
My interest.
Where's my monthIy interest?

304
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:36,263
Good saIes but no income?

305
00:25:38,403 --> 00:25:39,461
But I'm okay

306
00:25:39,604 --> 00:25:42,368
because Mr. PARK guaranteed.

307
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:46,174
Oh, Mr. KIM,

308
00:25:46,311 --> 00:25:50,338
doing a sports business in DiIi...
I don't think it's a good idea.

309
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:57,854
Because you gotta have money.
Even with soccer and basebaII.

310
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:00,651
You need money to pIay sports.

311
00:26:01,793 --> 00:26:03,852
Here, everybody poor.

312
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,261
They have to work.

313
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:09,858
But the kids here just pIay baII.

314
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:11,363
And no work.

315
00:26:12,504 --> 00:26:15,962
No money, no soccer and no future.

316
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,870
Fish-Iooking sIimebaII.

317
00:26:20,111 --> 00:26:23,638
Who says you can't pIay baII
if you're poor?

318
00:26:25,884 --> 00:26:29,650
He says he'II pay the interest
on time every month.

319
00:26:41,299 --> 00:26:42,857
By the way, no casseroIe?

320
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,263
It's aImost ready.

321
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,264
One doIIar! One doIIar!

322
00:26:47,305 --> 00:26:52,675
You're Siku, right?
You never skipped. Great.

323
00:26:52,811 --> 00:26:57,339
You gotta be Iike him.
Dinu, you aIso paid on time.

324
00:26:57,482 --> 00:27:01,350
You kids are bad.
How can you skip on payments?

325
00:27:02,087 --> 00:27:05,056
Ata. Attaboy!

326
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:11,862
What's this?

327
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:16,301
You can't just return the worn shoes.

328
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:17,666
I can't beIieve you guys.

329
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,769
Mr. KIM!

330
00:27:24,409 --> 00:27:26,070
I raised it.

331
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:36,745
It's bigger than other roosters.
Lots of meat.

332
00:27:37,389 --> 00:27:40,051
PIease, don't take away my shoes.

333
00:27:53,805 --> 00:27:59,471
Oh, man. Put them down.
Put down the shoes.

334
00:28:00,111 --> 00:28:04,138
It's aIright.

335
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,641
If not today,

336
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,349
tomorrow. Or the next day.

337
00:28:10,488 --> 00:28:11,352
If not,

338
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:16,153
whenever you've got the money.

339
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:20,353
It's aIright.
Whenever you have it.

340
00:28:27,205 --> 00:28:30,868
POONG, this is an investment.
Investment.

341
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:35,271
KIM, what are you doing over there?

342
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,540
This is reaIIy the Iast time.

343
00:28:38,683 --> 00:28:41,151
It's not Iooking good here, either.
Not good.

344
00:28:41,986 --> 00:28:42,953
I got it.

345
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:46,455
Hey, I can't hear you.
HeIIo? HeIIo?

346
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:52,562
Never mind.
Take care.

347
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,244
HeIIo, is it SangchuI?

348
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,051
I started a new business
and it Iooks promising.

349
00:29:16,788 --> 00:29:18,153
FinaI term?

350
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,249
Oh, you shouId go back to study.

351
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:26,062
I'II hang up.
Sorry to distract you.

352
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:29,161
And pIease teII mom I caIIed...

353
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:45,750
Even with the shoes,

354
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:47,545
we can't pIay on the fieId.

355
00:29:48,186 --> 00:29:51,644
And one doIIar a day is too much for me.

356

00:30:08,506 --> 00:30:09,473
Hey, you!

357
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:13,676
Hey! Mr. Kim. WeIcome, weIcome.

358
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:17,682
You wanna buy this?
15 doIIars for seven fish.

359
00:30:17,682 --> 00:30:18,444
Okay. Mr. Kim?

360
00:30:18,583 --> 00:30:21,143
Okay I'm not.

361
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:24,646
My kids are happy

362
00:30:24,789 --> 00:30:26,491
with their new shoes

363
00:30:26,491 --> 00:30:29,051
and why are you bothering them?

364
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:31,560
Bothering?
I never bothered them.

365
00:30:31,696 --> 00:30:34,563
I just tried to stop you
from tricking them.

366
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:35,461
Trick them?

367
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,861
How?

368
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,369
PIaying soccer barefoot is
..dangerous.

369
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:48,275
You gotta be weII equipped
in sports.

370
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:52,947
And the technique..gets better...

371
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,847
Upgraded.

372
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:57,145
So this isn't your scam to seII soccer shoes

373
00:30:57,288 --> 00:30:58,653
but you're here to improve them?

374
00:30:58,790 --> 00:30:59,449
That's right.

375
00:30:59,591 --> 00:31:01,855
You're pretty smart.

376
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:02,960
Prove it to me.

377
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:03,458
Prove?

378
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:04,960
Show me the proof you mean that.

379
00:31:07,298 --> 00:31:09,766
OK. Then, Iet's pIay a match.

380
00:31:10,001 --> 00:31:10,865
What?

381
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:14,563
Your team and my team,
Iet's have a match.

382
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:18,870
If you win, I'II Ieave the fieId.

383
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:20,272
But...

384
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:25,448
If we win,
mind your own business.

385
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:27,250
Okay, okay. Mr. Kim.
When do you wanna do it?

386
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,448
10 days...

387
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,858
I need some time.

388
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:34,959
10 days Iater.

389
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:38,186
Okay. But Iet's aIso bet a pig.

390
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:43,161
OK. Bet as many as...
one pig is good.

391
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:45,569
You're reaIIy doing it?

392
00:31:47,805 --> 00:31:49,170
You're reaIIy doing it?

393
00:31:49,307 --> 00:31:52,071
I don't know. I reaIIy don't.
Don't ask me any more.

394
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,974
So you act first and think Iater.

395
00:31:55,513 --> 00:32:01,145
It was nonsense from the moment you decided
to seII cIeats in this poor country.

396
00:32:01,286 --> 00:32:02,753
This wasn't gonna work.

397
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,048
Why didn't you say so before?

398
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:07,654
I did teII you every time
I saw you.

399
00:32:07,792 --> 00:32:10,556
Shut up!
How much is a pig here?

400
00:32:10,695 --> 00:32:14,153
A pig? I guess $300?

401
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,464
What?
Why is it so expensive?

402
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,669
There are pigs everywhere
on the street.

403
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:26,072
What costs them so much?
Fetch me two baIIs.

404
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,458
You're in. Next.

405
00:32:57,875 --> 00:32:58,671
Wow!

406
00:33:02,513 --> 00:33:04,947
No. Next.

407
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,044
He's good. Why not?

408
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:08,049
Too short.

409
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:09,844
Are you recruiting a basketbaII team now?

410
00:33:10,021 --> 00:33:10,885
Next.

411
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:28,965
You're a boy or a girI?

412
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,567
Boys onIy.

413
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:36,572
Next. Next.

414
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:40,048
From now on,
you're on my team.

415
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:41,148
You are my team.

416
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:44,348
I'm your coach. You're my pIayers.

417
00:33:45,089 --> 00:33:45,748
Understood?

418
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:47,152
Yes, sir.

419
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:52,354
You do as you're toId.

420
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:58,260
If not, no uniform.

421
00:33:59,604 --> 00:34:04,473
And no cIeats. OK?

422
00:34:04,609 --> 00:34:05,769
OK.

423
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:07,773
Good.

424
00:34:10,815 --> 00:34:12,612
You can't get soccer fieId back
with this!

425
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,852
Soccer fieId.
Think of a grass fieId.

426
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:20,957
You wanna pIay in the mud forever?

427
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:24,457
It Iooks hard.

428
00:34:24,595 --> 00:34:29,055
GIad you're not doing it, right?

429
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:08,667
Let's take a break.
Get some water.

430
00:35:25,389 --> 00:35:28,256
How come we just run aII day
and don't pIay footbaII?

431
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:32,120
I quit. What about you?

432
00:35:32,396 --> 00:35:34,956
I dunno. I'm just tired.

433
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:35,958
Losers.

434
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,359
Weren't you aII over him
Iike beggars for the free shoes?

435
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:41,472
What?

436
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:46,475
Forget it. I don't wanna argue
with a bum Iike you. Antonio?

437
00:36:04,195 --> 00:36:07,164
The Day of the Pig-staked Match

438
00:36:31,088 --> 00:36:33,249
Hey, what the heII is this?

439
00:36:33,791 --> 00:36:34,553
This is my team.

440
00:36:34,692 --> 00:36:39,857
They're not kids. They're aII aduIts,
you bastard.

441
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,962
Why? Something wrong there?
It's my team.

442
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:45,364
That's not what we agreed on.

443
00:36:46,504 --> 00:36:48,563
It's a match between
your team and mine. Remember?

444
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:52,666
Why, you scared?

445
00:36:56,314 --> 00:37:00,944
How dare you whisper into my ear?
You sIimy bastard.

446
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:05,655
Listen.

447
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,851
Riki, you just run.

448
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:11,860
Look around and pass it to him.
Long pass. Okay?

449
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,460
Yo! Don't get scared.

450
00:37:20,805 --> 00:37:23,171
You crying? Scared?

451
00:37:23,307 --> 00:37:26,470
Are you out of your mind?
C'mon. Let's go!!!

452
00:37:26,611 --> 00:37:29,580
It's okay, it's okay. Let's go!

453
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:22,361
You gotta bIock him. BIock him.

454
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:57,358
He's reaIIy good. He couId pIay
in the Indonesian pro Ieague.

455
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,469
They have pro teams in Indonesia?

456
00:38:59,603 --> 00:39:02,868
You didn't know?
It's these kids' dream.

457
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,567
It's their ticket out
if they couId make it to Indonesia.

458
00:39:18,289 --> 00:39:23,056
Park, can you Iend me $200
and buy me a pig?

459
00:39:25,996 --> 00:39:27,657
Bon appetite!

460
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:34,193
Mr. Kim, I heard you foIded your business.
Is that true?

461
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:36,671
You toId him aIready?

462
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,376
No, I work.

463
00:39:40,511 --> 00:39:41,375
Work?

464
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:45,642
I have 2 jobs
untiI I get the pig back.

465
00:39:45,783 --> 00:39:46,147
Two jobs?

466
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:50,549
You got 2 jobs, too.
SeII cars and Ioan money.

467
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:52,853
You're doing it again?

468
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,249
Last time was a warm up.

469
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:58,856
If I train them hard,
no one can beat us, even an aduIt team.

470
00:39:58,996 --> 00:40:01,863
Soccer isn't about strength.
It's about technique pIus teamwork

471
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,060
Anyhow I won't give up
untiI I get my pig back.

472
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:11,566
Ah, you're making me feeI bad.

473
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:14,269
Soccer isn't about being good
with the baII.

474
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:19,440
You gotta be big and taII.
You're short and smaII.

475
00:40:19,583 --> 00:40:20,550
Hey, you!

476
00:40:20,785 --> 00:40:26,655
You shouId pass right away.
Concentrate!

477
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,350
It's not Iike a nationaI team.

478
00:40:29,693 --> 00:40:31,558
Why don't you Iet him pIay?

479
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,260
When you're IittIe, it won't matter.

480
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:36,563
But when he gets oIder
and he isn't big or good enough.

481
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,361
That becomes miserabIe.

482
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:42,470
Now you're worried
about their future.

483
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,268
Why don't you worry about the pig first?

484
00:40:45,409 --> 00:40:47,377
Don't ignore my brother!

485
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,772
You stupid Korean.

486
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,352
Excuse me.

487
00:41:06,997 --> 00:41:08,658
How do I find this pIace?

488
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:10,660
Go straight that way.

489
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:12,669
Thank you.

490
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:25,640

498
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:59,241
I... I'm just... CaIm down, pIease.

499
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:00,646
What's going on?

500
00:42:01,185 --> 00:42:02,447
He was spying on us.

501
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:11,054
What are you doing here?

502
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:16,856
I'm not here for you.
I have business with your brother.

503
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,171
He's so taIented that
I want to train him properIy.

504
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:23,768
You train Ramos?

505
00:42:23,908 --> 00:42:24,374
Yes.

506
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:25,475
You?

507
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:26,971
You train Ramos?

508
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:30,837
Stop dreaming!

509
00:42:32,182 --> 00:42:35,049
I train him. Not you.

510
00:42:35,586 --> 00:42:37,554
Next year,
I wiII take him to Indonesia.

511
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:42,147
Pro? Do you know anything
about professionaI footbaII?

512
00:42:42,293 --> 00:42:45,456
You know nothing.

513
00:42:45,596 --> 00:42:47,461
Just stay out of it.

514
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:54,765
If you join us, I'II get you nice cIeats.

515
00:42:55,306 --> 00:42:56,864
Of course, it's free

516
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:03,640
Your brother may be a good pIayer
but he's not buying you shoes.

517
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:09,642
I offer them to you to recruit you.

518
00:43:11,288 --> 00:43:13,449
I'm recruiting your brother.

519
00:43:14,291 --> 00:43:17,749
This is the worId of pro.
The pro worId is...

520
00:43:18,896 --> 00:43:20,363
crueI.

521
00:43:26,904 --> 00:43:29,964
Hey! Korean.
I'm warning you.

522
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:32,767
You just wanna seII the soccer shoes to the kids.
Remember?

523
00:43:33,711 --> 00:43:35,770
Man, you keep annoying...

524
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,649
Ramos, it's up to you.

525
00:43:45,689 --> 00:43:49,955
Tensions between east and west escalate.
Grace period to register the assault weapons.

526
00:43:50,094 --> 00:43:52,153
This is getting intense.
It couId get worse.

527
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,965
Many are hurrying home.

528
00:44:00,604 --> 00:44:02,765
We have Iess than 10 Koreans Ieft.

529
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:05,667
This couId turn into a big riot.

530
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:09,679
What's there to fight
about in this smaII Iand?

531
00:44:10,681 --> 00:44:12,740
You got pepper sauce?
Pepper sauce!

532
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:15,845
He's too good to be wasted.

533
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:17,453
What? Where is it?

534
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:18,545
What?

535
00:44:18,689 --> 00:44:20,054
Pepper sauce.

536
00:44:20,591 --> 00:44:21,853
It's somewhere.

537
00:44:23,794 --> 00:44:25,853
This is for your dinner.

538
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:41,171
If I join you,

539
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:44,144
can I reaIIy go to an Indonesian team?

540
00:44:45,582 --> 00:44:46,947
If you're good.

541
00:44:47,084 --> 00:44:48,142
Promise me.

542
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:54,048
How can I promise such thing?

543
00:45:11,208 --> 00:45:12,072
Ramos!

544
00:45:24,688 --> 00:45:26,155
Good! Ramos!

545
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:29,154
You're doing good.

546
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:35,163
Do it right! Look at Ramos.

547
00:45:38,302 --> 00:45:40,964
One more match for a pig.

548
00:45:41,705 --> 00:45:42,763
Again?

549
00:45:43,507 --> 00:45:45,475
You want to Iose the game Mr. KIM?

550
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:48,874
This game three pigs!

551
00:45:49,813 --> 00:45:51,337
We have strong appetites.

552
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,746
Fine. Pick the time and day.

553
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,852
We'II be there.

554
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:03,057
You shouId practice
if you don't want your ass kicked.

555
00:46:28,786 --> 00:46:30,151
What's so funny about?

556
00:46:33,791 --> 00:46:35,986
C'mon, take it from me!

557
00:46:58,682 --> 00:47:01,845
Are you OK? Motavio! Motavio!

558
00:47:03,086 --> 00:47:06,852
The wound is minor
but I'm worries about his eyes.

559
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:08,549
His eyes?

560
00:47:08,792 --> 00:47:11,260
He damaged his eyesight
because of maInutrition.

561
00:47:20,404 --> 00:47:23,373
Happens a Iot here.

562
00:47:24,908 --> 00:47:28,275
If you don't do anything about it,
he may go bIind.

563
00:47:28,412 --> 00:47:29,470
BIind?

564
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:42,457
Write them down, POONG.

00:47:42,993 --> 00:47:47,259
Coenzyme Q10.

00:47:47,898 --> 00:47:49,365
These are eye nutrients.

567
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,566
Try to send them ASAP.
And some vitamins.

568
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,071
Okay? Thanks, bro.

569
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:22,661

00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:48,850
Korean dipIomats.
We're Korean dipIomats.

575
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,055
Do they actuaIIy fire guns?

576
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,356
You think they're carrying toy guns?

577
00:48:54,498 --> 00:48:56,363
What about my kids?

578
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,865
Who cares about the kids now?

579
00:48:59,102 --> 00:49:00,467

587
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:36,067
Hey, that's my Ramos.

What are you doing?

600
00:50:42,005 --> 00:50:42,767
He's Korean.

601
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:44,571
What the heII are you saying?

602
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:47,076
I think a Korean got shot.

603

I wouId know every Korean here.

604
00:50:49,713 --> 00:50:52,841
I heard him.
He screamed in Korean!

605
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,951
This is insane.

606
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:13,269
Open it. Hurry up!

607
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,667

00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:54,868
You didn't go home?

616
00:51:55,512 --> 00:51:56,945
Boss, I guarded our shop.

617
00:53:24,501 --> 00:53:25,365

00:53:42,686 --> 00:53:44,551
In a church.

624
00:53:44,688 --> 00:53:45,655
Church?

625
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,050
You have no home?

626
00:53:49,693 --> 00:53:51,752
What about your parents?

627
00:53:52,796 --> 00:53:54,457
They died during the war.

628
00:53:55,599 --> 00:53:56,759

5 doIIars.

632
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:19,752
Are you kidding?

633
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:21,852
It's expensive.

634
00:54:54,391 --> 00:54:55,551
Are you sure this is it?

635
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,071
Is this Motavio's pIace?

636
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,047
Who is it?

637
00:55:31,294 --> 00:55:33,262
Motavio, you scared the heII out of me.

638

Where's your brother?

652
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,249
Korean, what's up?

653
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:16,748
One more match for 3 pigs.

654
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,358
Anytime.

655
00:58:18,895 --> 00:58:20,760
2 o'cIock. Next week.

656
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:24,159
You're Iaughing?

657
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,968
Don't forget.

658
00:58:28,304 --> 00:58:29,271
Ramos!

659
00:58:30,206 --> 00:58:34,074
You're coming, right?
You're a pro.

660
00:58:41,584 --> 00:58:42,915
Motavio, pass!

661
00:58:44,587 --> 00:58:46,953
Center the baII. Motavio, run!

662
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:53,158
You were Iate. Again.

663
00:58:55,298 --> 00:58:56,458
Riki, center it.

664
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:05,169
Good. Once more.
Idiot. You can't even do it.

665
00:59:05,308 --> 00:59:08,471
Ramos,
you go run 10 Iaps around the beach.

666
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:12,040
Motavio, back in your position.

667
00:59:13,182 --> 00:59:17,346
Bring the baII. Bring it to me!
You want me to do it?

668
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:20,549
Go!

669
00:59:38,908 --> 00:59:39,670
Tua.

670
00:59:45,882 --> 00:59:48,942
You want to pIay with your friends?

671
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:53,849
You reaIIy want to?

672
00:59:58,695 --> 01:00:01,061
Okay. I'II Iet you pIay.

673
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:08,159
But since you're shorter than others,
you have to work twice as hard. Okay?

674
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:26,446
Josephine..

675
01:00:34,197 --> 01:00:39,658
Are you crying
in front of your sister?

676
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:52,343
Riki! Centering number 2.

677
01:00:56,986 --> 01:00:58,044
You get to it Iate.

678
01:00:58,187 --> 01:01:00,155
Motavio, you gotta run faster.

679
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:04,148
Riki, imagine Ramos' position
in your head. Okay?

680
01:01:04,293 --> 01:01:05,157
Okay!

681
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:19,866
WeII, good.

682
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,374
Good! Again!

683
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:29,745
The Day of the Rematch

684
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,261
Mr. KIM, we brought the pigs.

685
01:01:48,604 --> 01:01:50,807
We'II give you discounts. Buy them.

686
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:52,172
You Iousy sons of bitches.

687
01:01:52,308 --> 01:01:54,868
Go away, my team wiII win.
Go to the other side.

688
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:58,445
Ramos!

689
01:02:53,102 --> 01:02:55,570
KIM,
what have you done to the kids?

690
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:57,969
Wow!
We're gonna win! We wiII!

691
01:02:58,107 --> 01:02:59,665
Hey, you Iosers!

692
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:10,148
Right! Just Iike that!

693
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:31,705
Focus! Stupid!

694
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,765
It's so compIicated!

695
01:04:08,411 --> 01:04:12,745
I heard Ramos' brother got hurt
by Motavio's famiIy.

696
01:04:14,584 --> 01:04:19,044
During the civiI war,
Ramos' uncIe kiIIed Motavio's father.

697
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,861
The probIem just doesn't end there.

698
01:04:28,197 --> 01:04:30,427
The kids wiII remember everything.

699
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,368
And they wiII seek revenge.

700
01:04:35,204 --> 01:04:40,073
They bareIy got independent
from PortugaI and Indonesia.

701
01:04:40,910 --> 01:04:45,244
They don't know who's the enemy
and who's the friend.

702
01:04:46,883 --> 01:04:50,250
Thinking I'd make money
in this forsaken pIace,

703
01:04:51,487 --> 01:04:54,354
where peopIe are stiII shooting
at each other.

704
01:04:54,557 --> 01:04:57,287
How pitifuI I am!

705
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:04,155
Mr. KIM, how about a match
with the Indonesian Kids

706
01:05:04,300 --> 01:05:05,767
in West Timor?

707
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:10,466
If you find a common enemy
outside here,

708
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:17,442
I'm sure they wiII stop fighting each other
and stick together.

709
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,349
An internationaI tournament?
In where?

710
01:05:30,393 --> 01:05:34,261
Hiroshima. What do you think?
Isn't it a great idea?

711
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,260
Keep dreaming.

712
01:05:36,399 --> 01:05:39,061
Dream!
Yes, that's what they need.

713
01:05:39,201 --> 01:05:41,863
They need to dream.

714
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:43,972
Dreams shouId be reaIistic.

715
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:47,667
In such a poverty-stricken country.
Soccer shouId be just a pastime.

716
01:05:48,411 --> 01:05:53,542
Hey, who says you can't dream big
if you're poor?

717
01:05:54,283 --> 01:05:56,547
I thought better of you.

718
01:05:56,686 --> 01:06:01,248
No, I meant...
how are you get them to Hiroshima?

719
01:06:03,092 --> 01:06:07,051
See, that's why I came here to see you.

720
01:06:07,697 --> 01:06:10,564
Me? Why?

721
01:06:10,700 --> 01:06:14,568
Why? Why did I come see you?

722
01:06:14,704 --> 01:06:17,673
The question is why.
Hey, you're tense here.

723
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:21,675
This isn't a soccer association.
This is an embassy.

724
01:06:22,511 --> 01:06:24,843
I ain't the Minister of Sports.

725
01:06:24,981 --> 01:06:27,541
Right, the Minister of Sports.

726
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:29,651
You couId meet him.
A great idea.

727
01:06:29,785 --> 01:06:33,949
Shut up! You think it's some joke?
Get out of my way.

728
01:06:34,190 --> 01:06:37,455
The minister isn't someone
you caII up and visit.

729
01:06:38,294 --> 01:06:42,754
Hey, I'm going.
ReaIIy going there.

730
01:06:50,506 --> 01:06:51,666
Then, are we fIying there?

731
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:54,970
You wanna swim to Japan? SiIIy.

732
01:06:59,081 --> 01:07:02,847
Now, you gotta work harder.

733
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:07,349
Don't fight each other.

734
01:07:12,695 --> 01:07:17,962
You'II embarrass yourseIves
in front of the worId, got it?

735
01:07:18,100 --> 01:07:18,964
Okay.

736
01:07:19,101 --> 01:07:21,262
We are one team.
Team Timor-Leste.

737
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:22,666
Okay.

738
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:27,869
If you do weII there,
you couId get recruited.

739
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:28,772
Understood?

740
01:07:28,911 --> 01:07:29,878
Understood!

741
01:07:32,081 --> 01:07:35,642
Are you out of your mind?
You shouId say, yes sir.

742
01:07:36,085 --> 01:07:38,053
I taught you that, didn't I?
Anyhow..

743
01:07:38,187 --> 01:07:38,846
Understood?

744
01:07:38,988 --> 01:07:40,148
Yes, sir.

745
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:52,266
It's aII EngIish.
Park, you shouId fiII it in for me.

746
01:07:52,401 --> 01:07:54,665
It's impossibIe for me.

747
01:07:54,804 --> 01:07:59,468
Don't waste your time.
I toId you it's not gonna happen.

748
01:07:59,608 --> 01:08:01,576
I have an idea.

749
01:08:01,710 --> 01:08:06,647
You shouId just heIp me
with the EngIish stuff.

750
01:08:11,087 --> 01:08:18,050
Do you speII your first name "Ki" or "Gi?"
I'II pick "Gi."

751
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:23,563
You're a maIe, right?

752
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:25,562
What's this?

753
01:08:26,001 --> 01:08:28,765
Coach PARK In-gi.
Have you Iost your mind?

754
01:08:28,904 --> 01:08:31,168
Do I Iook Iike I'm on vacation?

755
01:08:31,407 --> 01:08:33,773
I'm a dipIomat
from the RepubIic of Korea.

756
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,840
They said we needed 2 coaches.

757
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:39,948
Why don't you take a break?
You work too hard.

758
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:41,447
No wonder you Iook oIder.

759
01:08:41,584 --> 01:08:42,846
I can't do that..

760
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:51,456
I need to go to Korea...
to have a bIind date.

761
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:00,059
How are you feeIing?

762
01:09:00,202 --> 01:09:01,965
I'm aIright. Thanks.

763
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:07,975
I brought the man you wanted to meet.
Mr. KIM Won-kwang.

764
01:09:10,179 --> 01:09:14,946
KIM Won-kwang?
You're KIM Won-kwang?

765
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:42,268
How couId he do this to me?
I saved his Iife.

766
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:46,240
Didn't you borrow money from everyone
in Indonesia for your Iumber business?

767
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:49,050
Mr. SHIN is one of them.

768
01:09:49,785 --> 01:09:54,745
No, it wasn't me. I don't know him.
You know it. You saw it.

769
01:09:55,090 --> 01:09:56,557
So you have to go back
to SeouI and expIain.

770
01:09:56,692 --> 01:09:58,557
Your being here isn't resoIving this.

771
01:10:00,095 --> 01:10:06,364
Of course, our embassy won't
or has any authority to send you back, Mr. KIM.

772
01:10:06,502 --> 01:10:10,962
But because you're invoIved
with the chiIdren here,

773
01:10:11,106 --> 01:10:12,767
this couId be a sensitive matter.

774
01:10:13,809 --> 01:10:18,746
FrankIy, it is in our best interest
to recommend you return to Korea.

775
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:21,841
Stupid bureaucrats.

776
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,648
They're the same everywhere.

777
01:10:25,588 --> 01:10:28,455
Mr. Ambassador was being considerate.

778
01:10:28,591 --> 01:10:33,051
Considerate?
You mean by asking me to disappear...

779
01:10:33,996 --> 01:10:35,861
I got scammed, too.

780
01:10:35,998 --> 01:10:38,762
If I knew how to swindIe,
why am I stiII broke?

781
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:51,310
I think you shouId return home quietIy
instead of getting kicked out

782
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,675
because of the rumor.

783
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,248
I thought I was finaIIy off to a good start.

784
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:31,247
When I get oIder, I'II kiII you.

785
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:33,148
No, I'II kiII you
before you have a chance.

786
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:39,056
Hey, you bastards,
what are you doing now?

787
01:11:43,098 --> 01:11:48,263
Sure, you don't deserve to pIay soccer.
I kidded myseIf.

788
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:54,667
Go back home.
Go fight or shoot at each other.

789
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:59,942
I don't care. Go back to your Iife.

790
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:11,050
Poong, remember that time...

791
01:12:11,393 --> 01:12:14,760
when we were pIaying baII
behind the Oscar Theatre?

792
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:16,964
Of course, I remember it.

793
01:12:17,399 --> 01:12:21,859
If you think about it,
it was the best time of my Iife.

794
01:12:22,705 --> 01:12:25,071
We were just happy to pIay baII.

795
01:12:25,207 --> 01:12:31,840
Hey, just come back
if you're done there.

796
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:39,548
l have a school coaching gig for you.
The pay is good.

797
01:12:39,888 --> 01:12:42,152
What eIse are we good at?

798
01:12:44,893 --> 01:12:48,954
Think it over.
A chance like this doesn't come often.

799
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:54,363
Hey, are you listening?

800
01:12:54,803 --> 01:12:57,169
Hey, did you faII asIeep?

801
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:25,965
I'm a fooI, right?

802
01:13:27,603 --> 01:13:32,666
You're not exactIy...
Okay, it's aII my fauIt.

803
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:35,368
Don't mind what I said
in front of the Ambassador.

804
01:13:35,811 --> 01:13:37,438
Just make sure
you don't screw up again.

805
01:13:38,680 --> 01:13:41,148
Do you know what my nickname was
when I was pIaying back then?

806
01:13:42,384 --> 01:13:44,545
Miss BaII because I missed the baII

807
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:47,651
whenever I had a chance for a goaI.

808
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:49,257
You're not making any sense.

809
01:13:49,591 --> 01:13:53,652
Let's go get some drinks.

810
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,063
I think...

811
01:13:59,101 --> 01:14:00,966
I'm gonna back to Korea.

812
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,839
Do you reaIIy beIieve
he's gonna make you a pro?

813
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,446
I'm just getting ready
for the tournament.

814
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:16,951
PeopIe found out he was a crook

815
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:19,053
and now he is running back
to his country.

816
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:21,349
It was just an act to seII soccer shoes.

817
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:25,956
Ramos, I toId you.

818
01:14:26,995 --> 01:14:29,054
We got each other.

819
01:14:29,198 --> 01:14:30,756
Don't trust the foreigners.

820
01:14:34,102 --> 01:14:35,160
Let's eat.

821
01:14:37,906 --> 01:14:40,875
Ramos! Ramos! Ramos!

822
01:14:41,009 --> 01:14:42,067
Ramos!

823
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:05,960
Be weII.

824
01:16:06,995 --> 01:16:08,656
Just give away
the rest to the kids.

825
01:16:08,797 --> 01:16:10,856
Thanks for everything, Major.

826
01:16:23,211 --> 01:16:24,735
You're not going to see them?

827
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:27,546
It wouIdn't be easy if I saw them.

828
01:16:36,792 --> 01:16:39,352
You weren't gonna Ieave
when I asked you.

829
01:16:40,195 --> 01:16:41,958
Let's not taIk about it, okay?

830
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,457
Let me know
when you're in SeouI.

831
01:16:47,102 --> 01:16:48,160
Take care.

832
01:16:51,106 --> 01:16:56,066
Mr. KIM, Ramos is
at the poIice station.

833
01:16:56,211 --> 01:16:57,644
What?

834
01:17:05,187 --> 01:17:06,051
Ramos!

835
01:17:08,690 --> 01:17:12,649
How couId they handcuff a kid?

836
01:17:12,894 --> 01:17:15,055
It's just a car stereo.

837
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:16,562
PIease step aside.

838
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:19,460
Wait! Wait a minute.

839
01:17:22,804 --> 01:17:24,567
He had his car decked up
with expensive stuff.

840
01:17:24,706 --> 01:17:25,764
How much is that stuff?

841
01:17:25,907 --> 01:17:28,171
It isn't just a car stereo.
It's Bang and OIufsen.

842
01:17:28,310 --> 01:17:30,039
So how much is it?

843
01:17:30,278 --> 01:17:32,337
4 grand and he wrecked it
as he was steaIing it.

844
01:17:32,581 --> 01:17:34,344
What the heII did you do that for?

845
01:17:34,983 --> 01:17:35,642
Hey, don't do it.

846
01:17:35,784 --> 01:17:36,944
Stay out of it.

847
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:38,743
Are you a thief?

848
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:40,049
I said, don't do it.

849
01:17:40,188 --> 01:17:41,348
Mind your own business.

850
01:17:46,995 --> 01:17:49,463
Why did you steaI?
For what?

851
01:17:51,500 --> 01:17:56,870
I wanted to go to
Indonesia for a tryout.

852
01:17:57,005 --> 01:18:00,168
We can't go to Hiroshima any more.

853
01:18:00,308 --> 01:18:02,173
I can't show the worId how good I am.

854
01:18:22,898 --> 01:18:24,160
PIease forgive him.

855
01:18:28,203 --> 01:18:30,569
I wiII work for you
untiI I can pay you back.

856
01:18:33,408 --> 01:18:34,875
PIease forgive him.

857
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:37,443
PIease.

858
01:18:40,282 --> 01:18:42,443
With those Iimping Iegs?

859
01:18:56,398 --> 01:19:01,165
PIease take this. It's aII I have.

860
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:07,866
He's onIy 11 years oId.

861
01:19:09,311 --> 01:19:11,541
And forgive him.
Forgive him. PIease.

862
01:19:11,680 --> 01:19:13,944
Mind your own business.

863
01:19:16,384 --> 01:19:18,648
Don't you dare show
your faIse pride, son.

864
01:19:25,594 --> 01:19:26,856
Ramos!

865
01:19:28,597 --> 01:19:34,365
I'm sorry...
for faiIing your trust.

866
01:20:09,504 --> 01:20:12,371
Mr. KIM, pIease don't go.

867
01:20:12,808 --> 01:20:15,572
Mr. KIM, I'II work harder.

868
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,742
Mr. KIM, pIease stay with us.

869
01:20:23,185 --> 01:20:25,949
Mr. KIM, pIease don't go.

870
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:33,553
Mr. KIM, pIease don't go.
Don't Ieave us.

871
01:20:43,405 --> 01:20:46,272
Mr. KIM, pIease don't go.
Stay with us.

872
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:44,062
Man, I was so ashamed...

873
01:21:46,601 --> 01:21:49,365
I couIdn't Iook the kids in the eye.

874
01:21:50,705 --> 01:21:55,870
They're good kids.
I wonder what they see in you.

875
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:57,039
I guess so.

876
01:21:58,780 --> 01:22:04,047
By the way, you'II pass it up?
I heard about the coaching job in SeouI.

877
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:10,649
I'm onIy interested..

878
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:14,457
in coaching nationaI teams.

879
01:22:20,502 --> 01:22:27,670
The truth is...
It wasn't Iike I was scamming peopIe.

880
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:35,539
If I were that kind of a person,
wouId I risk my Iife to save a stranger?

881
01:22:35,684 --> 01:22:37,948
Huh, who asked you to save me?

882
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:42,250
You were bIeeding and desperate
for your Iife back then.

883
01:22:42,390 --> 01:22:45,052
You grabbed my head so hard
and my hair feII off...

884
01:22:45,193 --> 01:22:48,356
No wonder they caII you a fraud
since you're so meddIing.

885
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:54,158
And on top of that...
you're trying go to Hiroshima?

886
01:22:54,302 --> 01:22:55,667
How did you know?

887
01:22:56,104 --> 01:22:58,971
Did you hire a private eye or something?

888
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:01,473
I pIaced a caII to the Ambassador.
Go visit him.

889
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,235
Excuse me?
What for?

890
01:23:05,080 --> 01:23:07,139
Aren't you going to meet
the Minister of Sports?

891
01:23:13,188 --> 01:23:16,248
Thank you, OsvaIdo.

892
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:18,659
I'II be in touch.

893
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:24,057
At Ieast we got the bIessing
from the Minister.

894
01:23:24,499 --> 01:23:27,957
What good is that if you have a passport
but no money?

895
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:30,669
Where's your spirit?

896
01:23:32,707 --> 01:23:34,572
You siIIy boy.

897
01:23:34,709 --> 01:23:37,735
Who poses Iike
that for a passport?

898
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,238
Stupid.

899
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:45,252
Wilson

900
01:23:45,387 --> 01:23:46,251
Tua

901
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:47,252
Motavio

902
01:23:47,389 --> 01:23:48,151
Alexon

903
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:50,148
Antonio

904
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:50,757
Abai

905
01:23:50,892 --> 01:23:51,256
Marito

906
01:23:51,393 --> 01:23:51,757
Jon

907
01:23:51,893 --> 01:23:52,257
Nelson

908
01:23:52,394 --> 01:23:52,758
Ricardo

909
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:53,258
Ata

910
01:23:54,896 --> 01:23:56,761
Ramos

911
01:23:57,198 --> 01:23:58,961
Yes, 17 peopIe.

912
01:24:02,103 --> 01:24:04,367
From DiIi to Hiroshima.

913
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:09,677
Money? No.

914
01:24:10,378 --> 01:24:13,939
No, not a probIem.
Okay. Thanks.

915
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,652
Excuse me, Mr. Vic?

916
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:24,454
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim.

917
01:24:24,793 --> 01:24:29,753
Here's the document for the kids
here for the Hiroshima...

918
01:24:29,998 --> 01:24:36,460
Soccer... Match... No airfare.

919
01:24:36,604 --> 01:24:38,868
Their dreams...

920
01:24:39,607 --> 01:24:42,474
Man, I'm going crazy.

921
01:24:46,748 --> 01:24:49,342
Let's see how it goes.

922
01:24:55,990 --> 01:24:56,752
Tua.

923
01:25:01,896 --> 01:25:04,660
Why did you bring it here?

924
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,560
Ramos, you can do this.

925
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:44,366
Thank you.

926
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:49,670
Mr. KIM, I'm not sure
if you can get the airfare this way.

927
01:25:49,878 --> 01:25:51,846
I'm just trying.

928
01:25:52,180 --> 01:25:53,442
I just do my best.

929
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:56,049
How about the broadcast rights?

930
01:25:56,184 --> 01:25:57,344
Broadcast?

931
01:25:58,386 --> 01:25:59,546
You're joking?

932
01:26:07,896 --> 01:26:10,160
These are eye nutrients.

933
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:14,662
And these are vitamins.

934
01:26:15,803 --> 01:26:16,963
Do not Iose them.

935
01:26:47,402 --> 01:26:49,165
That's not how you attract customers.

936
01:26:49,304 --> 01:26:50,862
Gotta speak up.

937
01:26:51,606 --> 01:26:54,666
Thirty fish for two doIIars.
Two doIIars.

938
01:27:09,190 --> 01:27:13,752
If we don't pay by tomorrow,
the reservation is canceIIed.

939
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:20,557
You wouId have your ass kicked anyway.
There's next time.

940
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:30,534
It's raining.
Get in.

941
01:27:39,687 --> 01:27:40,449
It's raining.

942
01:27:50,398 --> 01:27:51,558
It's raining!

943
01:27:56,504 --> 01:27:58,165
It's raining.
C'mon.

944
01:28:01,809 --> 01:28:02,776
PARK!

945
01:28:08,683 --> 01:28:12,346
Do you know why I'm trying so hard to go there
when we have no chance of winning?

946
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:14,653
Yes, why?

947
01:28:14,889 --> 01:28:16,447
I just wanted to finish something.

948
01:28:17,792 --> 01:28:18,656
Finish what?

949
01:28:19,494 --> 01:28:24,363
I wouId aIways start something
but never finish them. Never.

950
01:28:27,502 --> 01:28:29,970
I thought I couId get
to the finish Iine with the kids...

951
01:28:30,605 --> 01:28:32,869
where I've never been aIone.

952
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,140
Maybe...

953
01:28:42,183 --> 01:28:44,344
I'm not meant to be.

954
01:28:45,787 --> 01:28:47,652
The story of my Iife.

955
01:29:06,207 --> 01:29:11,941
I don't know how to do this but...

956
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:30,763
In East Timor,
the first independent state of the 21st Century...

957
01:29:32,700 --> 01:29:35,168
What am I doing?

958
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:38,669
It's too hard.

959
01:29:39,707 --> 01:29:42,574
No, no.
Not everyone can write...

960
01:29:43,478 --> 01:29:51,146
In East Timor,
the first independent state of the 21st Century...

961
01:29:51,285 --> 01:29:53,344
It's youth soccer team Ied

962
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:59,250
by a Korean coach...

963
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:03,452
they haven't been abIe to come
with the airfare

964
01:30:04,198 --> 01:30:13,470
and it's been a huge Ietdown for the kids...

965
01:30:21,983 --> 01:30:26,044
SangchuI, can you hear me weII?

966
01:30:27,789 --> 01:30:31,657
Why suIking?
You did terribIe at the exam. So what?

967
01:30:31,793 --> 01:30:34,353
You can do better next time.

968
01:30:34,495 --> 01:30:35,257
If not, there's aIways the next one.

969
01:30:35,396 --> 01:30:37,557
And the one after that
and another one.

970
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:38,858
You know the story of Don Quixote?

971
01:30:39,801 --> 01:30:46,969
Yes, you charge Iike Don Quixote!

972
01:30:48,009 --> 01:30:52,446
Son, do you know how to say "cheer up" here?
It's Porsa.

973
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:58,744
SangchuI, you're the man.
Porsa, my son!

974
01:31:21,209 --> 01:31:24,940
He's stiII there, huh?

975
01:31:34,489 --> 01:31:41,554
KIM! KIM!

976
01:31:43,197 --> 01:31:46,360
Has he gone mad or something?

977
01:31:46,501 --> 01:31:49,664
It's aII good.
We're going, we can go!

978
01:31:51,205 --> 01:31:52,172
Look at this.

979
01:32:00,481 --> 01:32:02,813
After Mr. KlM Won-kwang's story
came out,

980
01:32:02,884 --> 01:32:05,580
Basic House
decided to sponsor the air travel

981
01:32:05,620 --> 01:32:07,611
of the entire East Timor
youth soccer team

982
01:32:07,655 --> 01:32:09,624
for their participation
in the Hiroshima Rivelino Cup.

983
01:32:09,624 --> 01:32:12,855
The local clothing co. has been sponsoring
youth soccer for many years...

984
01:32:14,595 --> 01:32:16,153
We did it!

985
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:20,362
Hey, are you about to cry?

986
01:32:21,502 --> 01:32:23,868
You're gonna cry.

987
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:26,764
Why cry?

988
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:38,352
We're going.

989
01:32:41,689 --> 01:32:43,156
We're going to Japan.

990
01:32:43,491 --> 01:32:44,753
We're going.

991
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:38,842
Hiroshima, 2004

992
01:34:14,882 --> 01:34:17,544
Let's cheer more.

993
01:34:22,890 --> 01:34:25,256
It's onIy 2 goaIs.
Okay?

994
01:34:25,393 --> 01:34:25,654
Cheer up.

995
01:34:25,793 --> 01:34:26,555
Cheer up.

996
01:34:29,196 --> 01:34:31,858
I don't expect us to win
but scoring a goaI wouId be nice.

997
01:34:34,602 --> 01:34:35,967
It's freezing.

998
01:34:36,103 --> 01:34:36,865
Mr. Dojo.

999
01:34:37,505 --> 01:34:39,370
Are the kids okay
in this weather?

1000
01:34:39,507 --> 01:34:40,269
They're aIright.

1001
01:34:40,408 --> 01:34:41,466
ReaIIy?

1002
01:34:43,878 --> 01:34:45,345
Mr. Dojo, thank you.

1003
01:34:48,683 --> 01:34:49,650
Oh, sorry.

1004
01:34:51,485 --> 01:34:53,646
HeIIo, yes, yes.

1005
01:34:54,488 --> 01:34:56,456
Mr. David PIease.

1006
01:34:57,591 --> 01:34:58,558
HeIIo Mr. Dojo.

1007
01:34:58,693 --> 01:34:59,455
Yes, yes.

1008
01:34:59,593 --> 01:35:03,461
We're good to go.
Now connecting with Hiroshima.

1009
01:35:17,378 --> 01:35:18,640
Assist him!

1010
01:35:29,490 --> 01:35:30,855
Riki, center the baII.

1011
01:35:31,592 --> 01:35:32,957
The other side.

1012
01:35:41,302 --> 01:35:42,963
Is he okay?

1013
01:35:49,710 --> 01:35:53,840
Let's not wait for the second haIf.
Let's repIace him with Ramos.

1014
01:36:04,091 --> 01:36:05,149
Motavio?

1015
01:36:06,293 --> 01:36:07,555
How's your eyes?

1016
01:36:27,281 --> 01:36:30,546
Josephine, it's ready.

1017
01:36:39,293 --> 01:36:47,564
Riki, Ricardo, Ata,
Siku, Dinu, Pendi.

1018
01:36:52,506 --> 01:36:53,268
Tua.

1019
01:37:00,681 --> 01:37:01,739
Ramos.

1020
01:37:04,185 --> 01:37:05,243
That's it.

1021
01:37:11,792 --> 01:37:12,952
Motavio!

1022
01:37:15,996 --> 01:37:20,660
You did good.

1023
01:37:25,206 --> 01:37:28,573
Boys, you don't have to win.

1024
01:37:30,878 --> 01:37:35,542
Just do your best with no regret.

1025
01:37:37,384 --> 01:37:40,945
We're not done yet, right?

1026
01:37:42,289 --> 01:37:43,449
We're not done yet, right?

1027
01:37:46,093 --> 01:37:47,458
C'mon, guys.

1028
01:37:48,996 --> 01:37:50,156
Chin up!

1029
01:37:56,904 --> 01:37:58,166
AIright, Iet's go!

1030
01:38:00,908 --> 01:38:01,875
Chin up!

1031
01:38:20,394 --> 01:38:21,656
PIease.

1032
01:38:22,196 --> 01:38:23,857
I want to pIay.

1033
01:38:26,800 --> 01:38:29,963
Let me pIay.

1034
01:38:30,104 --> 01:38:31,469
I won't Iet you down.

1035
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:12,545
Now, we're connecting
with Hiroshima.

1036
01:39:12,680 --> 01:39:15,547
The second haIf is about to start.

1037
01:39:15,683 --> 01:39:19,949
Japan is Ieading 2:0.

1038
01:39:20,087 --> 01:39:22,453
Our pIayers must be inexperienced...

1039
01:39:22,589 --> 01:39:28,050
and not adjusted to the coId weather.

1040
01:39:28,195 --> 01:39:33,861
But we expect our pIayers to pIay weII

1041
01:39:34,001 --> 01:39:37,869
in the second haIf.

1042
01:39:44,678 --> 01:39:45,645
Motavio!

1043
01:39:51,185 --> 01:39:52,652
Can you make it work?

1044
01:39:57,491 --> 01:39:59,652
You can't change the pIayers
on the fIy Iike that.

1045
01:39:59,893 --> 01:40:02,157
We came aII the way here.
Let him pIay as much as he wants.

1046
01:40:02,296 --> 01:40:05,663
Look at the scoreboard.
You've given up aIready.

1047
01:40:06,600 --> 01:40:08,659
Who asked you to come aIong?

1048
01:40:08,902 --> 01:40:10,665
Guess who picked me as a coach.

1049
01:40:27,588 --> 01:40:29,249
Ramos dribbIes.

1050
01:40:36,897 --> 01:40:39,661
Ramos charges
on the Ieft sideIine.

1051
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,564
Motavio is near the penaIty area.

1052
01:40:45,205 --> 01:40:49,164
Ramos!
Pass it to Motavio.

1053
01:40:51,578 --> 01:40:55,947
Ramos faiIs to pass
and dribbIes forward again.

1054
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:04,654
Ah, that was a perfect centering opportunity,

1055
01:41:04,792 --> 01:41:06,760
but they just missed it.

1056
01:41:18,205 --> 01:41:19,968
Let's go with the pIan.

1057
01:41:20,107 --> 01:41:22,268
Motavio, first haIf.
Ramos, second haIf.

1058
01:41:22,709 --> 01:41:26,145
If they get in to a fight,
it'II be an internationaI disgrace.

1059
01:41:35,389 --> 01:41:38,358
See. Look at them.
Take one of them out.

1060
01:41:45,799 --> 01:41:47,460
Mr. Dojo who's at the game teIIs us...

1061
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:50,365
our pIayers are very good.

1062
01:41:50,504 --> 01:41:55,669
But they must be not ready
for the internationaI competition.

1063
01:42:07,588 --> 01:42:11,046
Ramos now possesses the baII again.

1064
01:42:25,005 --> 01:42:26,666
He's charging very fast.

1065
01:42:46,894 --> 01:42:49,863
Ramos just got knocked down

1066
01:42:50,797 --> 01:42:56,360
with a vicious tackIe from Japan.

1067
01:43:33,173 --> 01:43:35,937
Great! Nice there!

1068
01:44:24,091 --> 01:44:27,254
Motavio's getting deep
into the goal line!

1069
01:44:28,795 --> 01:44:31,457
Great pass could lead into a goal!

1070
01:45:04,598 --> 01:45:08,557
GOAL!

1071
01:45:13,373 --> 01:45:14,567
It's the first goaI ever
for an East Timor team

1072
01:45:14,641 --> 01:45:16,268
on an internationaI stage.

1073
01:45:16,343 --> 01:45:18,937
I'm proud of the young pIayers!

1074
01:45:30,891 --> 01:45:32,950
President, Xanana Gusmao

1075
01:46:09,696 --> 01:46:12,665
Tua tosses it over to Ramos.

1076
01:46:12,799 --> 01:46:14,960
Motavio charges in, too.

1077
01:46:15,102 --> 01:46:17,468
One-two pass between him
and Ramos.

1078
01:47:43,690 --> 01:47:47,057
Now you're confident
we can win the damn thing?

1079
01:47:48,795 --> 01:47:50,160
Winning's good.

1080
01:47:51,398 --> 01:47:53,559
But even if we Iose,
there's aIways the next time.

1081
01:47:54,601 --> 01:48:06,445
I'm just gIad this isn't the end.

1082
01:48:08,782 --> 01:48:11,945
Remember I said before,

1083
01:48:12,085 --> 01:48:14,451
I couId get to the finish Iine
with the kids?

1084
01:48:17,491 --> 01:48:18,958
You said you weren't sure about it.

1085
01:48:20,994 --> 01:48:22,256
I am now.

1086
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:26,159
Because they trust me.

1087
01:48:29,603 --> 01:48:30,968
That's aII I need.

1088
01:48:42,682 --> 01:48:49,053
Now it's a tie game.

1089
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:51,350
The peopIe of Timor-Leste,

1090
01:48:51,491 --> 01:48:54,460
you shouId be proud of our pIayers.

1091
01:48:54,895 --> 01:48:56,863
One more goaI and the victory is ours.

1092
01:48:58,899 --> 01:49:02,062
Tua is charging again rapidIy.

1093
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:09,675
Toward the penaIty area.

1094
01:49:30,797 --> 01:49:34,460
FouI!
That's a fouI inside the penaIty area.

1095
01:49:34,801 --> 01:49:42,264
It's a penaIty kick
for Team East Timor.

1096
01:49:48,381 --> 01:49:50,941
There's one minute Ieft.

1097
01:50:06,900 --> 01:50:09,368
You can do it! Come on Ramos!

1098
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:56,737
He Iost it! He Iost it!

1099
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:13,762
The injury time is aImost over.

1100
01:51:15,702 --> 01:51:17,966
This is the Iast chance.

1101
01:51:19,105 --> 01:51:20,663
The Iast corner kick of the game.

1102
01:51:28,882 --> 01:51:32,750
There's not much time Ieft.
Time's aImost up.

1103
01:51:51,204 --> 01:51:54,935
Shout big cheers for them!

1104
01:53:36,876 --> 01:53:42,337
The game's over.
Team East Timor won!

1105
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:46,648
Our young pIayers did
something unthinkabIe.

1106
01:54:54,387 --> 01:54:56,150
ln March 2004,
for the first time in the history of East Timor...

1107
01:54:56,289 --> 01:54:58,458
the youth soccer team
participated in an international match

1108
01:54:58,458 --> 01:55:00,426
the 30th Rivelino Cup in Hiroshima..

1109
01:55:03,897 --> 01:55:07,264
--http://7ays.com--
Against all odds,
they went on to win the championship

1110
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:09,995
with 6 miraculous wins.
