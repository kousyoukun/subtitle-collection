1
00:00:49,299 --> 00:00:52,260
East Timor had been colonized
by Portugal for around 450 years.

2
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,555
In 1975, 9 days after its independence,
East Timor was invaded by Indonesia

3
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:58,266
resulting in deaths
of up to 60,000 people.

4
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,894
During the 24 years of occupation,

5
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:04,272
one-fourth of the population,
or 200,000 people, were sacrificed.

6
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,444
International pressure forced
Indonesia to withdraw in 1999.

7
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,655
However, riots led by
the pro-Indonesian militia resulted

8
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:16,326
in thousands of deaths
and tens of thousands of refugees.

9
00:01:16,493 --> 00:01:19,871
East Timor finally achieved
its independence in year 2002.

10
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:24,250
However, the east-west conflict
still remains to be a potential for chaos.

11
00:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,255
This film is based on
a miraculous achievement

12
00:01:29,339 --> 00:01:32,217
by children of East Timor
and a korean soccer coach.

13
00:01:35,845 --> 00:01:38,515
Sumatra, Indonesia in 2003

14
00:01:56,074 --> 00:01:59,911
Hey, we have a gun. Why are you so scared?
You are a coward.

15
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:04,040
Whatever you say, all of the crocodiles
in this place are mine.

16
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,917
So just go. Go!

17
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:22,350
Whatever, just go. We can make the most
money when there is no competition.

18
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:24,978
Let's go. Go! Crocodile hunting!

19
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:34,445
That son of a bitch. You're bailing on me?

20
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:38,116
Come on. Get me out of here.

21
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:45,081
All the money I have lost
from my lumber business,

22
00:02:47,834 --> 00:02:51,337
I am going to earn it back
by catching crocodiles. Absolutely.

23
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:58,052
Noodles are almost done!

24
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,314
Damn, it is hot!

25
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,595
Come on. I am having a hard time.

26
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:44,224
I got burnt and I got malaria.
I'm serious.

27
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:48,311
The creditors Will hunt me down
if I stay here.

28
00:03:48,478 --> 00:03:51,231
Who? Shin who? Yeong-hoon shin?

29
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,983
Woo-seok is responsible for that.

30
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:58,821
Yes. But, what do you mean by a scam?

31
00:03:59,113 --> 00:04:01,491
You are calling your only brother
a con man?

32
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:04,452
Hello? Hey. Do not hang up.

33
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:12,961
The phone got disconnected.

34
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:45,868
Go away!

35
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:53,751
Mr. Won-gwang Kim.

36
00:04:55,503 --> 00:04:56,504
Hello.

37
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,550
Do you know me?

38
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,720
Was it 1983?

39
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:06,681
- Junior cup in Qatar, right?
- Well, yes.

40
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,124
The korean team was eliminated
in the qualifying tournament.

41
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:12,020
But the korean junior team
was full of talent...

42
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:13,229
Were you in soccer?

43
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:17,233
No. I saw you a couple of times when
you were with the hyundai motors team.

44
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,111
You wouldn't know me, of course.

45
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,751
I am Bo-hyeon yu, from yonhap news agency.

46
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:25,116
I am won-gwang Kim.

47
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,744
I said I know who you are.
You are kind of famous.

48
00:05:27,869 --> 00:05:29,537
I wasn't that famous in soccer...

49
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,041
Not too long ago, you almost died
in a jungle in sumatra.

50
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,626
Every korean in Indonesia
knows about that.

51
00:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,671
Don't you have a better story to cover?

52
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:45,887
So about the damn money...
I quit soccer to make money.

53
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:49,599
I have tried everything
but nothing worked.

54
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:54,562
I quit soccer, but how could I know how to
earn money? All I know is playing soccer.

55
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,439
How can I earn money?

56
00:05:56,522 --> 00:06:00,860
- So, what are you going to do now?
- Wait, I'm not done yet.

57
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:04,530
So, I borrowed money...

58
00:06:04,614 --> 00:06:07,283
You borrowed money and started
a factory in Indonesia.

59
00:06:07,366 --> 00:06:08,844
But you got scammed and went bankrupt.

60
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:09,952
How did you know that?

61
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,455
- You told me minutes ago.
- Did I?

62
00:06:13,164 --> 00:06:14,749
What are you going to do now?

63
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,587
What do you think I should do?

64
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:35,812
What are they doing here?

65
00:06:45,029 --> 00:06:47,740
Mr. Kim, have you heard of East Timor?

66
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:50,368
East what?

67
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,249
The 1st independent country
of the 21st century.

68
00:06:57,375 --> 00:06:59,544
Since they have nothing,
everything is a start.

69
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:03,923
Or should I say, they have nothing
since everything is a start?

70
00:07:04,006 --> 00:07:05,258
Dili, East Timor

71
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,136
but I think they have one thing for sure.

72
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,846
Hope.

73
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,811
Presidente nicolau lobato
international airport

74
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:13,766
hope. Right.

75
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,836
I don't have a car.

76
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:44,172
Hey. Get lost!

77
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:48,509
I appreciate it but you shouldn't push
a kid like that.

78
00:07:52,597 --> 00:07:53,764
That was too much.

79
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:56,434
Hey, are you okay?

80
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,737
Ramos

81
00:09:05,127 --> 00:09:06,379
There it is.

82
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,041
Rich? Soon?

83
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,550
- Me? Vision?
- Yes.

84
00:09:52,758 --> 00:09:57,805
Is the coffee mountain nearby?

85
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:07,648
Change?

86
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,196
James!

87
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,165
The UN is trying to hunt you down.

88
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,876
Get lost, you slimy weasel.

89
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:29,337
Do you want me to make the call?

90
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,677
Why are you hitting my head?

91
00:10:37,094 --> 00:10:38,554
James!

92
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,015
See you, my ass.

93
00:10:41,098 --> 00:10:42,266
James!

94
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,477
Did he talk about coffee again?

95
00:10:44,894 --> 00:10:47,396
That son of a bitch never changes
his repertoire.

96
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:51,859
Sorry about that. I am in-gi park
from the korean embassy.

97
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,486
You arrived today, right?

98
00:10:56,781 --> 00:11:01,077
Whether it is coffee or construction,
there is nothing to do here yet.

99
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:04,997
There are two types of Koreans
who come here.

100
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:10,795
Those who get scammed by people like
James, and those who scam like James.

101
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,881
So, I suggest you go back.

102
00:11:14,298 --> 00:11:15,966
There is absolutely nothing here.

103
00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:41,784
You have got to be kidding me.

104
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:56,382
Hello!

105
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:01,512
Seems like you checked out already.

106
00:12:02,388 --> 00:12:03,556
Let me give you a ride.

107
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:05,329
It's okay. There are plenty of cabs.

108
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,852
Come on, let me help out a fellow korean.

109
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,770
I'm all right.

110
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,897
I Will take you to the airport. Let's go.

111
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:18,904
I can get there myself.
Are you afraid that I might not leave?

112
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:23,576
No, it's not that. This place is
more dangerous than it might look.

113
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:27,913
There are gunfights and explosions,
once in a while.

114
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:34,295
It is my job to protect our citizens
in such a dangerous place.

115
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:44,555
I'm so sorry, sir.

116
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,642
- That little...
- Sorry.

117
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,479
Tua

118
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,856
so sorry, sir.

119
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,274
That was close.

120
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:02,948
Where are you going?

121
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:43,989
He has skills.

122
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,576
Idiot! You suck!
Don't even try to play again.

123
00:13:47,701 --> 00:13:49,703
I'll kill you!

124
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:58,546
Come on! You want a piece of me?

125
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,718
What are you doing? Let's go!

126
00:14:07,179 --> 00:14:08,305
I'm not leaving.

127
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:19,650
I told you nothing is going to work here,
but you won't listen.

128
00:14:20,776 --> 00:14:22,486
Sixty dollars? Are you crazy?

129
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,866
Mr. Kim, this would cost 6,000 won
back home.

130
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:29,159
Hey, this is Nike.

131
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,787
They are the same, I tell you.

132
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:33,455
And these are all knockoffs!

133
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:34,665
Knockoffs? How dare you!

134
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,251
Knockoff? It has the tag and everything.

135
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:38,961
I'm sure it is easy to fake them.

136
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,381
You see the kids here
playing soccer all the time?

137
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:47,428
Balls and shoes eventually wear off.

138
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:51,098
This is a business that can't go wrong.

139
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:54,602
Then why isn't there a sports store
in East Timor?

140
00:14:54,685 --> 00:14:58,522
So that's why we call it a monopoly.

141
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,190
Got it? Put it over there.

142
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:04,194
Mr. Ambassador, let's take a picture.
I want to put it up there.

143
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:08,616
Let's see.

144
00:15:08,782 --> 00:15:10,910
Yes, you can stand there.

145
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,703
In-gi, stand there. Hey, majur!

146
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,664
Take the photo, please.

147
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,799
Make sure you get the store sign,
Korea sports!

148
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,566
Welcome to the store.

149
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,652
Welcome!

150
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:47,613
These are soccer shoes.

151
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,783
Good choice. Sixty dollars.

152
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:56,455
Special discount, 35 dollars.

153
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,083
Hey.

154
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:00,584
See you again.

155
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:06,382
See you what?

156
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:08,592
That family should do wrestling,
not soccer.

157
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,221
One pair in two months, man...

158
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,029
It's delicious.

159
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:31,073
It's good.

160
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:36,741
Now that's a good business.

161
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,917
He knows how to run a business.
Not like someone...

162
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,211
Like who? Go away.

163
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:51,176
Everyone seems to want jeeps.

164
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:52,886
Oh, hello. Please sit.

165
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:57,391
Oh, it looks delicious. Thank you.

166
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,813
Me? Guarantee?

167
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,573
It's so delicious.
Fish casserole is the best.

168
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,538
Everyone look over here. Attention please.

169
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:21,206
You all got one?

170
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,917
It is called a monthly installment plan.

171
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,713
Motavio

172
00:17:27,838 --> 00:17:29,882
why are you late? Join the group.

173
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:31,884
I am talking over here. Don't interrupt.

174
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:36,889
In your language, it is called
the zizilan system.

175
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:40,184
It's a credit installment to be precise.

176
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:42,811
How do you say it in English?

177
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:45,314
Trust... something like that.

178
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:50,069
Anyways, I trust you.

179
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:53,989
So I give these to you.

180
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,033
And what do you do?

181
00:17:57,242 --> 00:18:01,038
Simply take them. Take. You're welcome.

182
00:18:01,205 --> 00:18:05,876
And... hey, pay attention.
I am still speaking.

183
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,586
It's important.

184
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,798
All you have to do is donate a dollar
every day to me.

185
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,299
What did I say?

186
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:15,010
You give one dollar to me every day.

187
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,721
Pretty good deal, isn't it?

188
00:18:17,805 --> 00:18:21,725
Two months and you're done. Okay?

189
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,813
It may be more expensive than
just buying them,

190
00:18:25,979 --> 00:18:29,066
but you can't afford them.

191
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:32,611
So, this is a good option for you.
Got it? Good choice.

192
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,373
Good!

193
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:50,254
Try them on. Okay.

194
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:38,594
Shoot!

195
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:40,137
Goal!

196
00:20:04,453 --> 00:20:07,456
Hey! What's the matter with you?

197
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,800
Nice. Very good.

198
00:20:19,426 --> 00:20:24,264
You guys played well with the cleats on.

199
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:28,810
Good.

200
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:33,523
One day, one dollar, right?

201
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:35,943
One dollar.

202
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:38,987
- Your name?
- Riki.

203
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,447
- Next is...
- Ata.

204
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,658
Ata, you are such a handsome boy.

205
00:20:42,741 --> 00:20:44,117
Next, is Ricardo.

206
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:47,663
-Abebi
-abebi, good!

207
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:48,914
- Next?
- Abai.

208
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,458
Abai, good.

209
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,960
- Who's next?
- Siku.

210
00:20:53,043 --> 00:20:55,462
Siku, okay.

211
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,923
- What is your name?
- Dinu.

212
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,218
Why is he staring at me?

213
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,470
- Who's next?
- Motavio.

214
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:05,222
Motavio.

215
00:21:19,569 --> 00:21:20,696
Hey, you.

216
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,824
Come here.

217
00:21:26,827 --> 00:21:28,120
What's your name?

218
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,454
Tua.

219
00:21:30,163 --> 00:21:31,206
Tua.

220
00:21:34,668 --> 00:21:35,836
Don't you want this?

221
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:01,111
One dollar. Next is, motavio!

222
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:07,826
One dollar, one dollar.

223
00:22:08,618 --> 00:22:09,953
Good choice.

224
00:22:10,579 --> 00:22:11,663
That's right.

225
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:14,416
Yes, pass it through. Shoot!

226
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,800
What are you waiting for?

227
00:22:23,884 --> 00:22:25,552
Do you call that a pass?

228
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,554
You have to make the pass right away.

229
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,638
What are you waiting for?

230
00:22:28,722 --> 00:22:31,433
Shoot! You might as well hand it over
to the goal keeper.

231
00:22:31,767 --> 00:22:33,351
And the goal keeper let it through?

232
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,729
Is this some comedy club?

233
00:22:39,232 --> 00:22:42,736
Marjo! Stop watering and catch the flies.

234
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,614
I am not marjo, I am majur.

235
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:49,534
What is the difference?

236
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:53,288
Okay. What's your name?

237
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:02,506
Passing play!

238
00:23:02,589 --> 00:23:04,633
Make the through pass quickly.

239
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:05,884
Shoot!

240
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,344
Right!

241
00:23:07,427 --> 00:23:09,137
Good!

242
00:23:42,337 --> 00:23:44,381
You have to do the pass play. Pass play.

243
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:50,053
Hey! Don't dribble. Pass it.

244
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:53,390
Good. Dinu! Shoot!

245
00:23:53,473 --> 00:23:56,017
Goal! That is how you play.

246
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,561
Good.

247
00:23:59,521 --> 00:24:00,772
What is this?

248
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:05,819
What are they doing in this sacred field?

249
00:24:18,999 --> 00:24:22,377
What? Who is this punk telling me
what to do?

250
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:27,841
You, why bother the kids?

251
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:29,676
- Bother?
- Yes.

252
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:36,850
You took it the wrong way.

253
00:24:37,017 --> 00:24:41,771
The money isn't for the field.
It's for the cleats.

254
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,940
It's a misunderstanding.

255
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,358
Money for the cleats?

256
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:47,319
Yes, you moron.

257
00:25:00,081 --> 00:25:04,502
Wherever I go, there is always
an annoying bastard like him.

258
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,255
Why do they have to be in my way?

259
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:14,304
It's another hot day.

260
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,601
Looks delicious. Thank you very much.

261
00:25:36,451 --> 00:25:41,248
But i’m okay because Mr. Park guaranteed.

262
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,707
It's okay.

263
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:18,618
Fish-looking slime ball...

264
00:26:18,827 --> 00:26:22,247
Who says you can't play ball
if you're poor?

265
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,169
He thanked you for lending him the money.
He'll make sure to pay the interest.

266
00:26:28,253 --> 00:26:29,671
- Really?
- Sure.

267
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,345
Please.

268
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,725
By the way, where's the soup?

269
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,143
It'll be served soon.

270
00:26:43,476 --> 00:26:45,979
One dollar!

271
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,439
- Your name was...
- Siku.

272
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:50,608
Right, siku. You never skipped. Great.

273
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,111
He never skipped. Learn from him, kids.

274
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,404
- Next?
- Dinu.

275
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,323
Dinu... dinu also paid on time.

276
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,076
You kids are bad. How can you
skip on payments?

277
00:27:00,493 --> 00:27:01,745
- What about you?
- Ata.

278
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,788
Attaboy! Handsome kid.

279
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:10,754
What's this?

280
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,008
You can't just return the worn shoes.

281
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,343
I can't believe you kids.

282
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,635
Mr. Kim!

283
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,976
Mr. Kim, this is a chicken I've raised.

284
00:27:26,603 --> 00:27:30,398
He's much bigger than other chickens,

285
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:35,528
so he's strong and has a lot of meat.

286
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:39,032
Please don't take the soccer shoes
away from us.

287
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:54,047
Put them down.

288
00:27:56,257 --> 00:27:58,259
Put down the shoes.

289
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:03,390
Hey, listen. Well... it's all right.

290
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:05,767
If you can't bring the money today,

291
00:28:05,975 --> 00:28:07,602
tomorrow or the day after tomorrow...

292
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,022
If that's not possible too...

293
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,068
You can pay me when you have the money.
It's alright.

294
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:16,778
It's all right. No problem.

295
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:19,155
When you have the money...

296
00:28:25,995 --> 00:28:29,624
Hey, coach poong. This is an investment.

297
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,837
Won-gwang Kim! What the hell are you
doing over there?

298
00:28:34,337 --> 00:28:36,214
This is really the last time.

299
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,926
It's not looking good here, either.

300
00:28:40,844 --> 00:28:41,845
I got it.

301
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,056
Hey, I can't hear you.

302
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,351
Never mind.

303
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,229
Take care.

304
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:09,998
Hello?

305
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,083
Is this sang-cheol?

306
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:14,794
I started a new business
and it looks promising.

307
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,671
Final term?

308
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,799
Oh, you should go back to studying.

309
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:25,054
I'll hang up. Sorry for distracting you.

310
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:27,891
And please tell mom that I...

311
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:46,451
You know, even though we do have
the soccer shoes,

312
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:50,538
we don't have the field where we can play.

313
00:30:07,055 --> 00:30:08,139
Hey, you!

314
00:30:17,106 --> 00:30:19,567
Stop with the nonsense. I'm not okay.

315
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:23,238
With my zizilan system, the kids are happy

316
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:25,156
with their new shoes.

317
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:27,784
Who are you to bother them?

318
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,789
You know, trick.

319
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:34,165
Trick?

320
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,125
Trick them? How?

321
00:30:36,376 --> 00:30:40,004
Playing soccer barefoot is dangerous!

322
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:46,761
You have to be well-equipped in sports.

323
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:51,266
And the technique gets... what's the word?

324
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:53,393
Leveled up.

325
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:58,314
That's right.

326
00:30:58,481 --> 00:31:00,567
You're smart!

327
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:04,945
Well...

328
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,366
Okay, sure! Then, let's play a match.

329
00:31:08,616 --> 00:31:09,534
What?

330
00:31:09,617 --> 00:31:12,954
Your team and my team, let's have a match.

331
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:17,375
If you win, I'll leave the field.
Yes, I'll give up.

332
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:18,793
But...

333
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:23,965
If we win, you mind your own business.

334
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,054
In about ten days?

335
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:32,515
I need some time.

336
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,482
Okay. Bet as many pigs you want.
One pig is okay.

337
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,068
Are you really doing it?

338
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:47,530
You're really doing this?

339
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,575
I don't know. I really don't.
Don't ask me anymore.

340
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:53,244
You act first and think later.

341
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,414
It was nonsense
from the moment you decided

342
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:59,417
to sell cleats in this poor country.

343
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,127
This wasn't going to work.

344
00:32:01,210 --> 00:32:03,379
Why didn't you say so before?

345
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,215
I told you every time I saw you.

346
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,093
Shut up. How much is a pig here?

347
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:10,178
- A pig?
- Yes.

348
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:12,597
I guess about 300 dollars?

349
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,766
What the hell?

350
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:19,020
There are pigs everywhere on the street.
Why is it so expensive?

351
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,982
Unbelievable.

352
00:32:23,066 --> 00:32:24,317
Fetch me two balls.

353
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:46,714
You're in. Next.

354
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,016
Wow.

355
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:01,938
No.

356
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:03,438
Next.

357
00:33:03,731 --> 00:33:05,400
He's good. Why not?

358
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,609
Too short.

359
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,194
Are you recruiting a basketball team?

360
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:09,278
Next.

361
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:27,338
Are you a boy or a girl?

362
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,717
This is a boys' team.

363
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:32,468
Next.

364
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,846
Next!

365
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:38,307
From now on, you're on my team.

366
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,600
We are a team.

367
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:42,687
I'm the coach, and you're the players!

368
00:33:43,479 --> 00:33:44,313
Understood?

369
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,565
Yes, sir.

370
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:50,570
From now on, you do as you are told.

371
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:56,034
If not, no uniform.

372
00:33:57,994 --> 00:34:01,205
And no cleats, too.

373
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:05,960
Good.

374
00:34:09,047 --> 00:34:11,299
We aren't taking back our field
at this rate!

375
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:14,886
Soccer field. Think of a grass field.

376
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:16,304
Go, go!

377
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:19,182
You want to play in the mud forever?

378
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:22,852
It looks hard.

379
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:27,065
Glad you're not doing it, right?

380
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:28,774
Hey, you!

381
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,319
That's it. Run.

382
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:32,695
You. Run.

383
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:34,781
Okay?

384
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:35,864
You!

385
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:37,449
Hey!

386
00:34:39,911 --> 00:34:41,329
Motavio!

387
00:35:05,144 --> 00:35:06,562
Let's take a break. Get some water.

388
00:35:23,663 --> 00:35:26,541
How come we just run all day
and don’t play football?

389
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:30,503
I'll quit tomorrow. What about you?

390
00:35:30,586 --> 00:35:32,839
I don't know. I’m just tired.

391
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,506
Losers.

392
00:35:34,632 --> 00:35:38,678
I knew this would happen when you were
so happy about free shoes and uniform.

393
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:39,679
What?

394
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,348
Forget it. I don't want
to fight you poor bastards.

395
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:45,393
Antonio!

396
00:36:02,535 --> 00:36:05,413
Match day for the pig

397
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:31,856
What the hell is this?

398
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:33,106
It's my team.

399
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:34,567
How is that your team?

400
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:38,029
They are all adults.

401
00:36:41,365 --> 00:36:43,618
That is not what we agreed on.

402
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:56,547
How dare you whisper in my ear?

403
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,508
You slimy bastard.

404
00:37:03,387 --> 00:37:04,387
Listen.

405
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,015
Riki, you just run.

406
00:37:06,349 --> 00:37:09,894
You, look around and pass it to him. Okay?

407
00:37:09,977 --> 00:37:10,895
Okay.

408
00:37:10,978 --> 00:37:12,355
- Okay?
- Okay!

409
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:14,565
Hey!

410
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,484
Don't get scared.

411
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:17,817
Don't be afraid.

412
00:37:17,985 --> 00:37:19,028
Come on.

413
00:37:19,111 --> 00:37:21,614
Are you crying? Why are you so scared?

414
00:37:21,697 --> 00:37:22,740
Are you out of your mind?

415
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,659
Come on. It's okay.

416
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:27,954
It's okay. Let's go!

417
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,016
Let's go!

418
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:58,901
Good pass!

419
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:02,071
Pass!

420
00:38:17,878 --> 00:38:18,796
Pass it!

421
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:20,464
You have to block him. Block him.

422
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:53,581
He's really good.

423
00:38:53,664 --> 00:38:55,791
He could play in the
Indonesian professional league.

424
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:57,793
There are professional teams in Indonesia?

425
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:01,130
You didn't know that?
It's what these kids dream about.

426
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:04,842
It's their ticket out if they could
make it to Indonesia.

427
00:39:16,604 --> 00:39:18,147
- Hey, in-gi.
- What?

428
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:21,150
Lend me 200 dollars and buy me a pig.

429
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:25,955
- Thanks for the food!
- Thanks for the food!

430
00:39:28,449 --> 00:39:29,449
What?

431
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:35,498
You jerk, you told him that already?

432
00:39:39,794 --> 00:39:44,048
I have two jobs until I get my pig back.

433
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:48,719
You have two jobs, too.
Sell cars and loan money.

434
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,055
You're doing it again?

435
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,849
Last time was a warm up.

436
00:39:53,933 --> 00:39:57,269
If I train them hard, no one can beat us,
even an adult team.

437
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:00,106
Soccer isn't about strength.
It's about technique and teamwork.

438
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,860
Anyways, I won't give up until I have
a pig pen full of pigs.

439
00:40:07,113 --> 00:40:09,782
You're making me feel bad.

440
00:40:09,865 --> 00:40:12,451
Soccer isn't about being good
with the ball.

441
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,954
You have to be big and tall.

442
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:17,289
You're short and skinny.

443
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:18,832
Hey, you!

444
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,294
You should pass it right away.
Concentrate!

445
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:24,880
Pass it right away. Like this.

446
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,842
It's not like a national team.

447
00:40:27,925 --> 00:40:29,718
Why don't you let him play?

448
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,555
It doesn't matter when you are little.

449
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:36,434
He Will be miserable when he gets older
because he is not big enough to play.

450
00:40:38,018 --> 00:40:41,230
Now you're worried about their future?

451
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:43,566
You should worry about the pigs.

452
00:40:43,649 --> 00:40:45,401
Don't ignore my brother!

453
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:47,945
You stupid korean!

454
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,043
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me.

455
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,630
How do I find this place?

456
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:08,549
Go straight that way.

457
00:41:08,632 --> 00:41:09,925
- That way?
- Yes.

458
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,009
Thank you.

459
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:23,856
Ramos?

460
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:34,700
Anybody home?

461
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:36,952
Ramos?

462
00:41:39,788 --> 00:41:42,666
Ramos, hi!

463
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:46,754
Don't you want to play with us?

464
00:41:46,962 --> 00:41:49,507
Go. I'm not playing with you.

465
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:52,092
Hey, let me finish.

466
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,906
Hey, korean! What are you doing here?

467
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:57,515
I'm just... calm down please.

468
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:58,973
What's going on?

469
00:41:59,433 --> 00:42:00,633
He was peeping into our house.

470
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:14,823
I'm not here for you.
I have business with ramos.

471
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,328
He's so talented
that I want to train him properly.

472
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:37,428
Pro?

473
00:42:37,471 --> 00:42:40,516
Do you know anything about
professional football?

474
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:43,352
You know nothing.
What an arrogant bastard.

475
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,521
Just stay out of it.

476
00:42:45,604 --> 00:42:46,981
Ramos?

477
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:53,320
I'll give you nice cleats if you join us.

478
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:54,738
Of course, it's free.

479
00:42:57,741 --> 00:43:02,204
Your brother may be a good player,
but he's not buying you shoes.

480
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:07,668
I offer the shoes to recruit you. Okay?

481
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:12,089
I'm recruiting your brother.

482
00:43:12,715 --> 00:43:16,844
This is the professional world.

483
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:18,512
The professional world is cruel.

484
00:43:31,984 --> 00:43:34,028
Man, you keep annoying me.

485
00:43:35,154 --> 00:43:37,656
Ramos, it's up to you.

486
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:50,461
This is getting intense.
It could get worse any minute.

487
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:51,753
Hot!

488
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:58,010
Many are hurrying home.

489
00:43:58,844 --> 00:44:01,013
There are less than 10 Koreans left.

490
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,766
This could turn into a big riot.

491
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,936
What's there to fight about
in this small island?

492
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,106
Where do you put your pepper sauce?
Pepper sauce!

493
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:13,859
He's too good to be wasted.

494
00:44:14,276 --> 00:44:15,611
What? Where is it?

495
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:18,155
- What?
- Pepper sauce.

496
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,115
Look for it yourself.

497
00:44:22,076 --> 00:44:23,911
This is for your dinner.

498
00:44:24,536 --> 00:44:27,623
Dribbling ability improved.
Passing ability...

499
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:42,262
If I join you,
can I really go to an Indonesian team?

500
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:45,265
If you're good.

501
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,392
Promise me.

502
00:44:50,187 --> 00:44:52,189
How can I make such a promise?

503
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:55,984
Come on! Everyone do it right!

504
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,444
Riki!

505
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,248
Ramos!

506
00:45:22,594 --> 00:45:24,346
Ramos, good!

507
00:45:25,013 --> 00:45:27,224
You're doing well.

508
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:30,185
Don't walk around!

509
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,230
Do it right! Loot at ramos.

510
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,986
One more match for a pig.

511
00:45:47,995 --> 00:45:49,580
We have strong appetites.

512
00:45:58,338 --> 00:46:01,133
You should practice if you don't want
to get your ass kicked.

513
00:46:26,992 --> 00:46:28,202
What are you laughing at?

514
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,249
Come on, come take the ball from me.

515
00:46:56,897 --> 00:46:58,023
Hey, are you all right?

516
00:46:58,482 --> 00:47:00,108
Motavio!

517
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:05,030
There isn't much to worry about
except his eyes.

518
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:06,949
His eyes?

519
00:47:07,032 --> 00:47:09,326
He is experiencing loss of sight
due to malnutrition.

520
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:12,578
One.

521
00:47:13,956 --> 00:47:14,956
Two.

522
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:16,374
Four.

523
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:21,588
It happens a lot here
because they don't get enough nutrition.

524
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:26,343
He might go blind if left untreated.

525
00:47:26,426 --> 00:47:27,636
Blind?

526
00:47:34,393 --> 00:47:37,813
Write them down, poong. Cyan soft capsule.

527
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,649
Soft.

528
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:45,362
Coenzyme q10.

529
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,531
These are eye nutrients

530
00:47:47,990 --> 00:47:49,283
and vitamins.

531
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:51,785
Try to send them asap.

532
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:53,494
Okay?

533
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:55,372
Okay, thank you.

534
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,311
Going blind at his age?

535
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,063
Kim!

536
00:48:22,232 --> 00:48:23,232
Kim!

537
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:24,817
Kim!

538
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,020
I told you something may happen.

539
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,663
- Hey, behind!
- What are they?

540
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,624
- Hey!
- Shit.

541
00:48:40,834 --> 00:48:42,502
Korean diplomats!

542
00:48:42,919 --> 00:48:46,923
We are korean diplomats!

543
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,383
Thank you!

544
00:48:48,467 --> 00:48:51,219
Do they actually shoot and stuff?

545
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,780
You think they're carrying toy guns?

546
00:48:52,804 --> 00:48:54,723
Then what about my kids?

547
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:56,183
The kids are not your problem.

548
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:59,686
- I'm coming with you.
- No, you stay here!

549
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,188
Let me fight with you!

550
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:05,651
- Let me fight with you!
- I told you. You should stay here.

551
00:49:05,734 --> 00:49:08,904
Please let me come!

552
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,501
Let's wait here for a bit.

553
00:49:22,584 --> 00:49:24,184
One false move and we're in big trouble.

554
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:34,096
That's... that's ramos!

555
00:49:34,721 --> 00:49:36,014
Nonsense. Why would he be here?

556
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:36,932
Ramos!

557
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,058
Mr. Kim!

558
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:39,725
Mr. Kim!

559
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:44,981
Shit... Mr. Kim!

560
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:46,857
Ramos!

561
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:49,110
Ramos!

562
00:49:50,278 --> 00:49:51,278
Ramos!

563
00:50:16,179 --> 00:50:17,723
This way!

564
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,742
Help me!

565
00:50:36,825 --> 00:50:37,825
Here!

566
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:39,828
What's wrong?

567
00:50:39,911 --> 00:50:40,954
He's korean.

568
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:43,123
What the hell are you talking about?

569
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:45,083
I think a korean got shot.

570
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,544
I would know every korean here.

571
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:51,047
I heard him clearly.
He screamed in korean!

572
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,841
This is insane. I can't believe you...

573
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,898
Sorry. Excuse me.

574
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,109
Hurry up. Please.

575
00:51:11,359 --> 00:51:13,570
Someone is dying in here. Hurry!

576
00:51:15,071 --> 00:51:16,364
Help me...

577
00:51:16,448 --> 00:51:17,866
Oh, Mr. Yeong-hoon shin!

578
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,242
Do you know him?

579
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:20,911
Yes. He came here yesterday.

580
00:51:20,994 --> 00:51:24,039
Oh, god.

581
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,167
My head!

582
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,377
Help me! I don't want to die!

583
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:31,546
Let go if you want me to help you.

584
00:51:46,269 --> 00:51:47,269
Hey.

585
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:49,355
Hey, you.

586
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,068
You didn't go home?

587
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:55,028
Boss, I guarded our shop.

588
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:23,574
Hey!

589
00:53:24,993 --> 00:53:25,993
Tua!

590
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:33,335
You like it?

591
00:53:34,252 --> 00:53:35,252
Delicious?

592
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:36,587
Delicious.

593
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:40,467
Where do you live?

594
00:53:40,717 --> 00:53:42,636
In a church.

595
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:43,720
Church?

596
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,056
You have no home?

597
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:49,768
What about your parents?

598
00:53:50,810 --> 00:53:52,437
They died during the war.

599
00:53:53,730 --> 00:53:54,730
Really?

600
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:59,361
My brother runs well. He's fast.

601
00:54:12,415 --> 00:54:13,458
How much is it?

602
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,001
It's five dollars.

603
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,879
Are you kidding me?

604
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,756
That's too expensive.

605
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:53,581
Are we almost there?

606
00:55:10,890 --> 00:55:11,975
Motavio?

607
00:55:24,571 --> 00:55:25,989
Who is that?

608
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,327
Motavio, you scared me.

609
00:55:35,832 --> 00:55:37,167
Where have you been?

610
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:38,667
Soccer.

611
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,503
Soccer what?

612
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,588
Aren't we playing soccer?

613
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,424
There are no players anymore.

614
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,426
By the way,

615
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:49,012
how's your eye?

616
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:50,512
Pig...

617
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,766
We should get our pig back

618
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:54,809
and our field.

619
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,272
Well, that's...

620
00:57:36,786 --> 00:57:38,621
Mr. Kim!

621
00:57:38,913 --> 00:57:40,457
Mr. Kim!

622
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:41,875
Mr. Kim!

623
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:43,793
Mr. Kim! Let's go play soccer!

624
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:48,047
Mr. Kim!

625
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:50,049
Mr. Kim! Let's go play soccer!

626
00:57:50,133 --> 00:57:52,260
Mr. Kim! Let's go play soccer!

627
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:54,888
You rascals.

628
00:58:03,396 --> 00:58:04,397
Ramos.

629
00:58:05,148 --> 00:58:06,608
Ramos, where’s your brother?

630
00:58:07,484 --> 00:58:09,319
Korean, what’s up?

631
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:12,572
I want to have one more match.

632
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,699
Of course, three pigs.

633
00:58:15,408 --> 00:58:16,409
Anytime.

634
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:18,912
Next week, at 2:00 P.M.

635
00:58:20,914 --> 00:58:22,373
You won't be laughing later.

636
00:58:22,499 --> 00:58:23,958
Don’t forget.

637
00:58:26,377 --> 00:58:27,377
Ramos.

638
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,589
Ramos, you Will come, right?

639
00:58:30,924 --> 00:58:32,175
You're a pro.

640
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:40,850
Motavio, pass!

641
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:44,938
Center the ball. Motavio, run!

642
00:58:48,983 --> 00:58:51,194
Motavio, you were late!

643
00:58:53,279 --> 00:58:54,322
Riki, center the ball!

644
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:03,039
- Idiot. What was that?
- Good. That was good.

645
00:59:03,122 --> 00:59:06,501
Ramos, you go run ten laps
around the beach.

646
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,963
Motavio, back into position.

647
00:59:11,130 --> 00:59:12,131
Bring the ball.

648
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,301
Bring the ball! You want me to do it?

649
00:59:17,387 --> 00:59:18,638
Keep it up!

650
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:37,990
Tua.

651
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:46,583
Do you want to play with your friends?

652
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:51,713
Do you really want to?

653
00:59:56,509 --> 00:59:58,886
Okay. I Will let you play.

654
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:04,142
But since you're shorter than others,
you have to play twice as hard.

655
01:00:05,143 --> 01:00:06,144
Okay?

656
01:00:23,244 --> 01:00:24,454
Josephine.

657
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:35,465
Are you crying in front of
your little sister?

658
01:00:35,757 --> 01:00:37,508
Hey. Stop crying.

659
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:50,271
Riki! Centering number two!

660
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:56,069
You get it too late.

661
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,112
Motavio. You have to run faster!

662
01:00:58,571 --> 01:01:02,283
Imagine ramos' position
in your head. Okay?

663
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,367
Okay.

664
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:17,840
Good work!

665
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,342
One more time!

666
01:01:24,972 --> 01:01:27,767
The day of the rematch

667
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,227
ramos!

668
01:01:29,894 --> 01:01:30,895
That way!

669
01:01:31,896 --> 01:01:34,399
Hey! Run!

670
01:01:34,857 --> 01:01:36,776
Hey! Defense!

671
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,362
Defense!

672
01:01:44,033 --> 01:01:46,327
Mr. Kim, we brought the pigs!

673
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:48,788
We'll give you discounts. Buy them.

674
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:50,206
You lousy sons of bitches.

675
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,709
Go away, my team Will win.
Go to the other side.

676
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:54,127
- Three pigs.
- No!

677
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:56,295
- Pass!
- Ramos!

678
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:58,297
Ramos, good!

679
01:02:01,259 --> 01:02:04,846
Motavio! Good! Pass!

680
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:07,849
Pass!

681
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:08,932
Pass!

682
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:10,685
Pass!

683
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:16,232
Good, pass!

684
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:23,698
Shoot!

685
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:53,519
Mr. Kim, what did you do to the kids?

686
01:02:53,644 --> 01:02:55,938
Wow, we are going to win!

687
01:02:56,022 --> 01:02:57,356
Eat that!

688
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:08,075
That's right!

689
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:16,417
Pass.

690
01:03:16,876 --> 01:03:20,379
- Pass!
- Pass!

691
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:21,464
Pass!

692
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:23,299
- Pass!
- Pass!

693
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:24,926
- Pass!
- Pass!

694
01:03:28,721 --> 01:03:29,889
Hey, you!

695
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:04,090
It's too complicated.

696
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:10,721
I heard that ramos' brother got hurt
by motavio's family.

697
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:16,769
During the civil war, motavio's father
was shot dead by ramos' uncle.

698
01:04:33,202 --> 01:04:37,748
They barely got independence
from Portugal and Indonesia.

699
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:43,004
They don't know who's the enemy
and who's the friend.

700
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:48,217
Thinking I would make money
in this forsaken place,

701
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:52,263
where people are still shooting
at each other.

702
01:04:52,513 --> 01:04:55,141
What a mess.

703
01:05:24,211 --> 01:05:27,423
An international tournament? Where?

704
01:05:28,382 --> 01:05:32,011
Hiroshima. Isn't it a great idea?

705
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,473
- Keep dreaming.
- Yes! Dream!

706
01:05:35,556 --> 01:05:37,141
That's exactly what these kids need.

707
01:05:37,224 --> 01:05:39,810
They need to dream!

708
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:41,896
Dreams still should be realistic.

709
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:45,608
In such a poverty-stricken country,
soccer should be just a pastime.

710
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,489
Hey, who says you can't dream big
if you're poor?

711
01:05:52,239 --> 01:05:54,408
I thought better of you.

712
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:55,952
That's not what I meant.

713
01:05:57,161 --> 01:05:59,288
How are you going to
get them to Hiroshima?

714
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:04,877
In-gi, that's why I came to see you.

715
01:06:05,795 --> 01:06:08,506
What? Why?

716
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:12,510
Why? Why did I come to see you?

717
01:06:12,677 --> 01:06:15,554
The question is why.
Hey, you're tense here.

718
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:19,433
This isn't a soccer association.
This is an embassy.

719
01:06:20,434 --> 01:06:22,770
I'm not the minister of sports.

720
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:25,940
That's right! You can ask
the minister of sports!

721
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:27,650
You are a genius!

722
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:31,696
That's enough. You're acting like a kid.
Get out of my way!

723
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:35,282
I'm too busy for this nonsense.

724
01:06:36,283 --> 01:06:40,705
In-gi, I'm going! I'm really going!

725
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,880
Then, are we flying there?

726
01:06:50,256 --> 01:06:52,925
You want to swim to Japan? Silly.

727
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:00,641
Now, you have to work harder.

728
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,229
Don't fight each other.

729
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,690
Got it?

730
01:07:08,524 --> 01:07:10,192
You idiots.

731
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:15,906
You'll embarrass yourselves
in front of the world, got it?

732
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:17,033
Okay!

733
01:07:17,116 --> 01:07:19,285
We are one team. Team Timor-Leste.

734
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,494
Okay!

735
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:25,791
If you do well there,
you could get recruited.

736
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:26,792
Understood?

737
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:27,918
Understood.

738
01:07:30,046 --> 01:07:33,549
Are you out of your mind?
You should say, yes sir!

739
01:07:34,050 --> 01:07:36,010
I taught you that, didn't I? Anyways...

740
01:07:36,177 --> 01:07:38,095
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

741
01:07:44,935 --> 01:07:47,354
So difficult.

742
01:07:47,688 --> 01:07:50,232
In-gi, you should take care of this.

743
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:52,777
This is impossible.

744
01:07:52,860 --> 01:07:57,323
Give it up. Don't waste your time.
I told you it won't happen.

745
01:07:57,573 --> 01:07:59,575
I have plans.

746
01:07:59,658 --> 01:08:04,663
Just take care
of this English stuff for me.

747
01:08:09,001 --> 01:08:14,173
Do you spell your first name "ki" or "gi"?

748
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:16,050
I'll pick "gi."

749
01:08:20,137 --> 01:08:21,555
You're a male, right?

750
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:23,682
What is this?

751
01:08:23,933 --> 01:08:26,685
Coach in-gi park? Have you lost your mind?

752
01:08:26,894 --> 01:08:29,146
Do I look like I'm on a vacation?

753
01:08:29,522 --> 01:08:31,732
I'm a diplomat of the republic of Korea.

754
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,777
They say we need two coaches.

755
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:37,988
Take it easy. Go on a vacation.

756
01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:39,591
No wonder you look older than your age.

757
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:40,741
I told you, I can't!

758
01:08:42,743 --> 01:08:43,828
In this vacation...

759
01:08:46,163 --> 01:08:49,416
My parents arranged me a blind date.
I have to get married, sometime.

760
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:51,669
Yes?

761
01:08:53,838 --> 01:08:56,715
- Hello, Mr. Shin.
- Oh, you came.

762
01:08:57,299 --> 01:09:00,010
- Are you okay?
- Yes, I'm okay.

763
01:09:00,136 --> 01:09:03,347
I brought the person you wanted to meet.

764
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:05,975
He is won-gwang Kim.

765
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,020
- Won-gwang Kim?
- Yes.

766
01:09:10,855 --> 01:09:12,940
You're won-gwang Kim?

767
01:09:19,780 --> 01:09:22,700
Shit. Oh, god.

768
01:09:34,670 --> 01:09:39,967
I saved his life.
How can he do this to me?

769
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:44,305
Didn't you borrow money from everyone
for your lumber business in Indonesia?

770
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,974
Mr. Yeong-hoon shin is one of them.

771
01:09:47,725 --> 01:09:52,521
No, it wasn't me. I didn't even know
yeong-hoon shin. You know that.

772
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:56,567
So you have to go back and explain.
Staying here doesn't solve anything.

773
01:09:57,735 --> 01:10:04,325
Of course, our embassy doesn't have
the authority to send you back.

774
01:10:04,408 --> 01:10:10,497
But this is a sensitive matter because
your work here involves children.

775
01:10:11,790 --> 01:10:16,587
Frankly, it is in our best interest
to recommend you to return to Korea.

776
01:10:17,546 --> 01:10:20,007
Stupid government workers.

777
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:22,343
They are the same everywhere.

778
01:10:23,510 --> 01:10:26,430
Mr. Ambassador was being considerate.

779
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:30,976
Considerate? He wants
a guy like me to disappear!

780
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,771
I got scammed, too.

781
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:36,690
If I knew how to swindle,
why am I still broke?

782
01:10:43,530 --> 01:10:48,953
I think you should return quietly
instead of getting kicked out

783
01:10:49,578 --> 01:10:51,622
because of the rumor.

784
01:10:55,542 --> 01:10:58,170
I thought I was finally off
to a good start.

785
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:06,136
Pass! Okay!

786
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:17,773
Hey!

787
01:11:17,982 --> 01:11:18,982
Siku!

788
01:11:25,322 --> 01:11:27,366
- Motavio!
- Motavio!

789
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:29,326
When I get older, I'll kill you.

790
01:11:29,410 --> 01:11:31,161
No, I'll kill you
before you have a chance.

791
01:11:34,748 --> 01:11:36,959
You bastards! What are you doing now?

792
01:11:41,046 --> 01:11:46,218
Sure, you don't deserve to play soccer.
Who was I kidding?

793
01:11:48,095 --> 01:11:49,263
Go back home.

794
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,725
Go fight and shoot at each other.

795
01:11:54,059 --> 01:11:57,688
I don't care. Go back to your life.

796
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:09,033
Hey, coach poong. Remember that time

797
01:12:09,366 --> 01:12:12,703
when we were playing ball
behind the Oscar theater?

798
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,580
Yes, I remember.

799
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:19,543
If you think about it,
I was really happy back then.

800
01:12:20,753 --> 01:12:22,963
We were just happy to play ball.

801
01:12:23,130 --> 01:12:26,842
Whatever. Hey, won-gwang Kim,

802
01:12:27,384 --> 01:12:29,845
just come back if you're done there.

803
01:12:30,804 --> 01:12:33,515
I have something prepared for you here.

804
01:12:34,266 --> 01:12:37,603
I have a school coaching gig for you.
The pay is good.

805
01:12:37,811 --> 01:12:40,397
You'll be better off here,
don't you think?

806
01:12:40,481 --> 01:12:41,648
Aren't I right?

807
01:12:42,941 --> 01:12:46,945
Think about it. A chance like this
doesn't come often.

808
01:12:48,155 --> 01:12:52,159
Hey, won-gwang. Won-gwang?
Are you listening?

809
01:12:52,868 --> 01:12:55,120
Hey won-gwang! Did you fall asleep?

810
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:23,941
In-gi. I'm a fool, right?

811
01:13:25,484 --> 01:13:27,778
You're not exactly...

812
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:30,656
Okay, it's all my fault.

813
01:13:30,739 --> 01:13:33,367
Don't mind what I said
in front of the ambassador.

814
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:34,993
Just don't screw up again.

815
01:13:36,620 --> 01:13:39,123
Do you know what my nickname was
when I was playing back then?

816
01:13:40,290 --> 01:13:42,501
Miss ball, because I missed the ball

817
01:13:43,836 --> 01:13:45,629
whenever I had a chance for a goal.

818
01:13:45,712 --> 01:13:47,256
You're not making any sense.

819
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:51,510
Stop feeling remorseful
and let's go get some drinks.

820
01:13:52,010 --> 01:13:53,010
In-gi,

821
01:13:57,057 --> 01:13:58,934
I think I am going to go back to Korea.

822
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:10,922
Do you really believe that he's going to
make you a professional player?

823
01:14:10,946 --> 01:14:12,626
I'm just getting ready for the tournament.

824
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:14,950
He's a crook.

825
01:14:15,117 --> 01:14:16,757
Now he's running back to his own country.

826
01:14:17,161 --> 01:14:19,329
It was just an act to sell soccer shoes.

827
01:14:21,290 --> 01:14:23,667
I always told you
that we just need each other.

828
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:26,837
Ramos, don't trust the foreigners.

829
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:28,672
We don't need their help.

830
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:33,134
Let's eat.

831
01:14:35,846 --> 01:14:39,683
Ramos!

832
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:03,891
Take care of yourself.

833
01:16:04,977 --> 01:16:08,647
Just give away the rest to the kids.

834
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:22,879
You don't want to see them
before you leave?

835
01:16:23,620 --> 01:16:25,539
It wouldn't be easy if I saw them.

836
01:16:31,336 --> 01:16:34,131
Airport

837
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:37,342
you weren't going to leave
when I asked you.

838
01:16:38,176 --> 01:16:39,928
Let's not talk about it, okay?

839
01:16:41,805 --> 01:16:43,432
Let me know when you're in Seoul.

840
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:46,143
Take care.

841
01:16:48,895 --> 01:16:53,859
Mr. Kim, ramos is at the police station.

842
01:16:54,109 --> 01:16:55,360
Ramos?

843
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:04,077
Ramos!

844
01:17:05,746 --> 01:17:10,250
How could you handcuff a kid?

845
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:13,211
Don't you think this is too much
for just a car stereo?

846
01:17:13,295 --> 01:17:15,130
- Please step aside.
- What?

847
01:17:15,213 --> 01:17:17,633
Wait! Wait a minute.

848
01:17:17,966 --> 01:17:20,010
- Mr. Kim.
- Wait.

849
01:17:20,510 --> 01:17:22,387
He had his car decked up
with expensive stuff.

850
01:17:22,471 --> 01:17:23,555
How much is that stuff?

851
01:17:23,764 --> 01:17:26,141
It isn't just a car stereo.
It's bang and olufsen.

852
01:17:26,224 --> 01:17:28,018
I don't care. How much is it?

853
01:17:28,101 --> 01:17:30,312
It's 4,000 dollars.
And he broke it while stealing it.

854
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,939
What the hell did you do that for?

855
01:17:33,023 --> 01:17:34,149
Hey!

856
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:36,693
- Hey!
- Why did you do it?

857
01:17:36,777 --> 01:17:37,903
Hey! Don't do it!

858
01:17:44,785 --> 01:17:47,454
Is that what I taught you?
Why did you steal that? For what?

859
01:17:49,289 --> 01:17:54,878
I wanted to go to Indonesia for a tryout.

860
01:17:54,961 --> 01:17:59,633
We can't go to Hiroshima anymore.
I can't show the world how good I am.

861
01:18:38,130 --> 01:18:40,465
You Will work for him
with those limping legs?

862
01:19:09,911 --> 01:19:11,329
Mind your own business.

863
01:19:14,374 --> 01:19:16,501
Don't dare show your false pride, son.

864
01:19:23,550 --> 01:19:24,676
Ramos,

865
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:28,180
I'm sorry

866
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:32,017
for failing your trust.

867
01:20:07,469 --> 01:20:10,096
Mr. Kim, I'll practice harder.

868
01:20:10,680 --> 01:20:13,475
Please stay with us.

869
01:20:16,019 --> 01:20:19,689
Please don't go.

870
01:20:21,024 --> 01:20:23,777
Mr. Kim, please don't go. Don't leave us.

871
01:20:24,236 --> 01:20:27,489
Mr. Kim, please don't go.

872
01:20:28,198 --> 01:20:31,326
Mr. Kim, please don't go.

873
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:43,672
Mr. Kim, please don't go.

874
01:20:57,185 --> 01:21:00,397
Mr. Kim, please don't go.

875
01:21:00,856 --> 01:21:04,109
Mr. Kim, please don't go.

876
01:21:04,693 --> 01:21:07,696
Mr. Kim, please don't go.

877
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,813
Man, I was so ashamed...

878
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:47,360
I was so ashamed that I couldn't look
at the kids in their eyes.

879
01:21:48,695 --> 01:21:53,658
They're good kids.
I wonder what they see in you.

880
01:21:54,117 --> 01:21:55,160
I know, right?

881
01:21:56,661 --> 01:21:58,830
By the way, you'll pass it up?

882
01:21:59,623 --> 01:22:01,958
I heard about the coaching job in Seoul.

883
01:22:04,961 --> 01:22:08,590
I'm not interested in coaching
for a small team.

884
01:22:10,175 --> 01:22:12,302
I'm only interested in coaching
for a national team.

885
01:22:18,433 --> 01:22:21,144
The truth is...

886
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:25,523
It wasn't like I was scamming people.

887
01:22:26,358 --> 01:22:29,986
If I were that kind of person,

888
01:22:30,362 --> 01:22:33,531
would I risk my life to save a stranger?

889
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:35,951
Well, who asked you to save me?

890
01:22:36,034 --> 01:22:40,080
You were bleeding and desperate
for your life back then.

891
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:43,124
You grabbed my head so hard
that my hair fell off...

892
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:46,086
No wonder they call you a fraud
since you're so meddling.

893
01:22:46,544 --> 01:22:52,175
And on top of that, you're bringing
those kids to Hiroshima?

894
01:22:52,258 --> 01:22:53,551
How did you know about that?

895
01:22:54,052 --> 01:22:56,888
Are you doing background checks on me?

896
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,349
I put in a call to the ambassador.
Go and meet him.

897
01:23:00,141 --> 01:23:01,935
Why the ambassador?

898
01:23:03,019 --> 01:23:04,938
Aren't you going to meet
the minister of sports?

899
01:23:05,480 --> 01:23:06,648
My goodness.

900
01:23:18,326 --> 01:23:19,804
Secretary of state for youth and sports

901
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,871
at least we got the blessing
from the minister.

902
01:23:22,414 --> 01:23:26,001
What good is a passport if we don't have
the money to fly?

903
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,461
Won-gwang Kim.
What happened to your spirit?

904
01:23:30,588 --> 01:23:32,549
You silly boy.

905
01:23:32,632 --> 01:23:35,760
Who poses like that for a passport?

906
01:23:36,052 --> 01:23:38,346
That silly...

907
01:23:42,434 --> 01:23:43,309
Wilson

908
01:23:43,393 --> 01:23:44,393

909
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,436
motavio

01:23:45,478 --> 01:23:46,479
alexon

911
01:23:47,522 --> 01:23:48,398
Antonio, abai

912
01:23:48,481 --> 01:23:49,816
marito, John

913
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:51,276
Nelson, Ricardo, ata

ramos

916
01:24:22,640 --> 01:24:27,687
Here is the paper for the kids here

917
01:24:28,021 --> 01:24:31,483
for the Hiroshima soccer game.

918
01:24:31,858 --> 01:24:34,486
Airport... no money...

919
01:24:34,569 --> 01:24:36,362
Boys often dream...

920
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:39,991
Man, I'm going crazy.

921
01:24:44,871 --> 01:24:47,248
They're going to think about it.
Fingers crossed.

922
01:24:48,875 --> 01:24:50,668
Soccer game...

923
01:24:53,797 --> 01:24:55,632
Tua!

924
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:02,597
Why did you bring it here?

925
01:25:10,814 --> 01:25:11,814
Mr. Kim.

926
01:25:13,149 --> 01:25:14,149
Thank you.

927
01:25:25,161 --> 01:25:27,205
Ricardo.

928
01:25:28,998 --> 01:25:31,543
And, siku!

929
01:25:32,043 --> 01:25:33,503
Mendi.

930
01:25:35,463 --> 01:25:38,424
Ramos, you can do this.

931
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:42,095
Thank you.

932
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:47,392
Mr. Kim, I'm not sure if you can
get the airfare this way.

933
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:49,853
I'm just trying.

934
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:53,898
How about the broadcast rights?

935
01:25:55,900 --> 01:25:57,277
You're joking?

936
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:08,079
Do not lose them.

937
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:12,375
These are vitamins.

938
01:26:13,793 --> 01:26:14,793
Take them.

939
01:26:29,309 --> 01:26:33,479
The national youth soccer team's
fund-raising event

940
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,076
That's not how you attract customers.

941
01:26:47,285 --> 01:26:48,912
You have to speak up.

942
01:26:49,621 --> 01:26:52,707
Thirty fish, two dollars!

943
01:27:07,096 --> 01:27:11,643
They Will cancel the flight
if the money isn't there by Friday.

944
01:27:12,977 --> 01:27:18,316
We won't be able to win anyway.
There's always a next time.

945
01:27:25,365 --> 01:27:28,451
It's starting to rain. Let's go back.

946
01:27:37,502 --> 01:27:38,503
It's raining.

947
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:49,429
It's raining!

948
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:56,062
You'll catch a cold!

949
01:27:59,691 --> 01:28:00,691
In-gi.

950
01:28:06,656 --> 01:28:10,034
Do you know why I'm trying so hard for
a match when we have no chance of winning?

951
01:28:11,286 --> 01:28:12,578
Why do you try so hard?

952
01:28:12,704 --> 01:28:14,414
I want to see how it ends.

953
01:28:15,790 --> 01:28:16,790
How it ends?

954
01:28:17,500 --> 01:28:22,171
I would always start something,
but I never see the end of it.

955
01:28:25,383 --> 01:28:27,719
I thought I could get
to the finish line with the kids.

956
01:28:28,428 --> 01:28:30,513
I've never been there.

957
01:28:36,853 --> 01:28:37,895
Maybe,

958
01:28:40,106 --> 01:28:42,108
it's not meant to be.

959
01:28:43,609 --> 01:28:45,528
The story of my life.

960
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:06,132
I don't know how to do this stuff.

961
01:29:08,926 --> 01:29:09,969
But...

962
01:29:21,356 --> 01:29:25,526
In East Timor, the first independent state

963
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:29,113
of the 21st century...

964
01:29:31,115 --> 01:29:32,992
What the hell am I doing?

965
01:29:35,119 --> 01:29:36,537
This is driving me crazy.

966
01:29:37,705 --> 01:29:39,874
Writing is not for everyone.

967
01:29:41,250 --> 01:29:44,962
In East Timor, the first independent state

968
01:29:45,963 --> 01:29:49,008
of the 21st century,

969
01:29:49,092 --> 01:29:51,427
a korean coach is leading

970
01:29:52,929 --> 01:29:56,808
an East Timor youth soccer team.

971
01:29:57,809 --> 01:30:01,604
They found the opportunity to play
at the international tournament

972
01:30:02,105 --> 01:30:04,899
but haven't been able to pay
for the airfare,

973
01:30:06,692 --> 01:30:11,197
so they are on the verge of
losing the opportunity.

974
01:30:20,081 --> 01:30:23,835
Sang-cheol! Can you hear me well?

975
01:30:25,336 --> 01:30:29,340
What's the big deal? You did
terrible at the exam. So what?

976
01:30:29,757 --> 01:30:32,301
You can do better next time.

977
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:35,513
There is always a next time, sang-cheol.

978
01:30:35,596 --> 01:30:36,956
You know the story of Don quixote?

979
01:30:37,807 --> 01:30:40,059
Yes, you charge like Don quixote!

980
01:30:40,143 --> 01:30:45,189
If you keep trying your best,
you Will achieve your goal someday.

981
01:30:45,898 --> 01:30:49,068
Son, do you know how to say
"cheer up" in Timor language?

982
01:30:49,152 --> 01:30:50,528
It's porsa.

983
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:52,196
Sang-cheol, porsa, my son!

984
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,240
Porsa, my son!

985
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:56,617
Porsa, my son!

986
01:31:06,586 --> 01:31:08,212
Yonhap news

987
01:31:18,973 --> 01:31:20,099
Won-gwang Kim?

988
01:31:21,267 --> 01:31:22,685
He's still there?

989
01:31:32,278 --> 01:31:33,529
Mr. Kim!

990
01:31:35,281 --> 01:31:37,200
Mr. Kim!

991
01:31:38,159 --> 01:31:39,285
Mr. Kim!

992
01:31:40,912 --> 01:31:42,288
What has gotten into him?

993
01:31:42,914 --> 01:31:44,207
Has he gone mad or something?

994
01:31:44,290 --> 01:31:47,543
- It's all good! We're going!
- What?

995
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:50,004
Take a look at this.

996
01:31:58,304 --> 01:32:01,224
After Mr. Kim's story came out,
basic house decided to sponsor

997
01:32:01,307 --> 01:32:04,560
the air travel of the entire East Timor
youth soccer team for their competition.

998
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:06,896
They're sponsoring it.

999
01:32:07,605 --> 01:32:10,900
We're going to Hiroshima!

1000
01:32:12,443 --> 01:32:14,362
We did it!

1001
01:32:16,447 --> 01:32:19,242
Are you about to cry?

1002
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:22,370
You're about to cry, aren't you?

1003
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:24,455
Why are you crying?

1004
01:32:35,132 --> 01:32:36,217
We're going.

1005
01:32:39,470 --> 01:32:40,930
We're going to Japan!

1006
01:32:41,264 --> 01:32:43,099
We're going!

1007
01:33:33,149 --> 01:33:37,028
Hiroshima, Japan in march 2004

1008
01:34:12,688 --> 01:34:15,358
Let's cheer harder!

1009
01:34:20,404 --> 01:34:23,074
It's only two goals. Okay!

1010
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:24,700
- Cheer up!
- Cheer up!

1011
01:34:26,619 --> 01:34:29,747
I don't expect us to win,
but scoring a goal would be nice.

1012
01:34:32,166 --> 01:34:34,627
- It's freezing.
- Mr. Dojo!

1013
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:37,129
Are the kids okay in this weather?

1014
01:34:37,213 --> 01:34:39,465
- They're all right.
- Really?

1015
01:34:40,341 --> 01:34:41,634
Hello.

1016
01:34:41,717 --> 01:34:43,052
Thank you.

1017
01:34:46,305 --> 01:34:47,515
Sorry.

1018
01:34:48,849 --> 01:34:51,519
- Riki!
- Hello? Yes, yes.

1019
01:34:57,358 --> 01:34:58,442
We're good to go.

1020
01:34:58,526 --> 01:35:01,028
Now connecting to Hiroshima.

1021
01:35:01,112 --> 01:35:02,571
Move quickly!

1022
01:35:15,126 --> 01:35:16,544
Assist him!

1023
01:35:27,179 --> 01:35:28,764
Riki, center the ball!

1024
01:35:29,515 --> 01:35:30,808
The other side!

1025
01:35:39,108 --> 01:35:40,734
Is he okay?

1026
01:35:47,366 --> 01:35:49,118
Let's not wait for the second half.

1027
01:35:50,077 --> 01:35:52,121
Let's replace him with ramos.

1028
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:03,174
Motavio.

1029
01:36:04,216 --> 01:36:05,593
How are your eyes?

1030
01:36:16,896 --> 01:36:20,983
Go, Japan!

1031
01:36:24,987 --> 01:36:26,447
Josephine.

1032
01:36:27,031 --> 01:36:28,282
It's ready.

1033
01:36:37,166 --> 01:36:40,127
Riki, Ricardo, ata.

1034
01:36:40,920 --> 01:36:44,882
Siku, dinu, mendi.

1035
01:36:50,179 --> 01:36:51,222
Tua.

1036
01:36:58,437 --> 01:36:59,522
Ramos.

1037
01:37:01,899 --> 01:37:02,900
That's it.

1038
01:37:09,657 --> 01:37:10,699
Motavio,

1039
01:37:13,744 --> 01:37:15,329
you did the best as you could.

1040
01:37:15,746 --> 01:37:18,332
You've done well.

1041
01:37:22,920 --> 01:37:26,131
Guys, we don't have to win.

1042
01:37:28,759 --> 01:37:30,177
Just do your best

1043
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:33,097
with no regrets.

1044
01:37:35,391 --> 01:37:36,767
We're not done yet,

1045
01:37:38,018 --> 01:37:39,144
right?

1046
01:37:40,062 --> 01:37:41,438
Right?

1047
01:37:43,816 --> 01:37:45,067
Come on, guys.

1048
01:37:46,944 --> 01:37:47,987
Cheer up!

1049
01:37:54,743 --> 01:37:56,036
All right, let's go!

1050
01:37:58,664 --> 01:37:59,832
Cheer up!

1051
01:38:06,630 --> 01:38:08,299
Mendi, cheer up.

1052
01:38:09,383 --> 01:38:11,427
Mendi, it's okay.

1053
01:38:18,225 --> 01:38:21,645
Please. I want to play.

1054
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:29,111
Let me play. I won't let you down.

1055
01:39:04,772 --> 01:39:08,400
Now, we're connecting with Hiroshima.

1056
01:39:08,484 --> 01:39:13,572
After the half time break, the second half
is about to start as I speak.

1057
01:39:13,656 --> 01:39:16,241
Japan is leading two to zero.

1058
01:39:16,325 --> 01:39:20,704
As you know, our players are inexperienced
and unfamiliar with the cold weather.

1059
01:39:20,788 --> 01:39:22,790
They look nervous and a bit stiff

1060
01:39:22,873 --> 01:39:25,959
because it's their first match abroad,
let alone in a cold country.

1061
01:39:26,043 --> 01:39:30,172
But, I believe our players
Will do much better

1062
01:39:30,255 --> 01:39:32,049
in the second half.

1063
01:39:32,132 --> 01:39:35,386
Please root for them. Let's go!

1064
01:39:35,469 --> 01:39:37,096
Let's go!

1065
01:39:42,476 --> 01:39:43,769
Motavio.

1066
01:39:48,982 --> 01:39:50,192
You can do this.

1067
01:39:55,322 --> 01:39:57,324
You can't change the players
on the fly like that.

1068
01:39:57,574 --> 01:39:59,952
We came all the way here.
Let him play as much as he wants.

1069
01:40:00,035 --> 01:40:03,622
Look at the scoreboard already.
You've given up already.

1070
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:06,542
Who asked you to come along?

1071
01:40:06,625 --> 01:40:08,502
Guess who picked me as a coach.

1072
01:40:25,269 --> 01:40:26,979
Ramos! Good!

1073
01:40:27,062 --> 01:40:28,188
Run!

1074
01:40:31,734 --> 01:40:34,653
Ramos dribbles.

1075
01:40:34,737 --> 01:40:37,364
We hear ramos is now in possession
of the ball.

1076
01:40:37,448 --> 01:40:40,284
Ramos charges on the right sideline.

1077
01:40:42,870 --> 01:40:44,455
Ramos, motavio!

1078
01:40:45,581 --> 01:40:47,040
Hey! Pass it!

1079
01:40:49,376 --> 01:40:53,839
Ramos fails to pass
and dribbles forward again.

1080
01:40:58,635 --> 01:41:00,596
What a pity.

1081
01:41:00,679 --> 01:41:04,391
That was a perfect centering opportunity.

1082
01:41:16,028 --> 01:41:17,821
Let's go with the plan.

1083
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:19,990
Motavio, first half. Ramos, second half.

1084
01:41:20,532 --> 01:41:22,761
If they get into a fight,
it'll be an international disgrace.

1085
01:41:22,785 --> 01:41:24,077
An international disgrace!

1086
01:41:33,128 --> 01:41:34,421
See? Look at them.

1087
01:41:34,755 --> 01:41:36,256
Take one of them out.

1088
01:41:43,639 --> 01:41:45,432
Mr. Dojo,

1089
01:41:45,516 --> 01:41:49,895
who is at the game, tells us
that our players are very good.

1090
01:41:49,978 --> 01:41:53,440
But they must not be ready
for the international competition.

1091
01:41:54,733 --> 01:41:57,611
Tua! Pass it to ramos! Good!

1092
01:41:57,694 --> 01:41:59,905
Ramos!

1093
01:42:01,406 --> 01:42:03,659
Go, ramos!

1094
01:42:03,742 --> 01:42:04,952
Yes!

1095
01:42:05,244 --> 01:42:08,831
Ramos now has the ball again.

1096
01:42:22,302 --> 01:42:24,721
Ramos is charging very fast.

1097
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:29,434
- Pass it!
- Defense!

1098
01:42:31,645 --> 01:42:33,146
Defense!

1099
01:42:44,658 --> 01:42:47,619
Ramos just got knocked down

1100
01:42:48,620 --> 01:42:50,956
with a vicious tackle from Japan.

1101
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:54,126
He's still down.

1102
01:43:30,871 --> 01:43:33,749
That was good, kid!

1103
01:43:50,807 --> 01:43:52,434
Let's go, guys!

1104
01:44:02,736 --> 01:44:04,071
Cheer up!

1105
01:44:17,501 --> 01:44:19,044
Ramos, pass!

1106
01:44:21,797 --> 01:44:23,757
Motavio makes a dash for the goal line.

1107
01:44:23,840 --> 01:44:26,551
Pass it!

1108
01:44:26,635 --> 01:44:29,471
One nice pass Will make a goal chance.

1109
01:44:30,514 --> 01:44:31,682
Pass!

1110
01:44:31,765 --> 01:44:33,517
Pass!

1111
01:44:36,186 --> 01:44:38,021
Pass it.

1112
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:53,161
Okay!

1113
01:45:02,462 --> 01:45:05,007
Goal! Timor scored a goal!

1114
01:45:05,090 --> 01:45:06,717
Goal!

1115
01:45:10,095 --> 01:45:14,016
It's Timor's first goal in the history
of its international match!

1116
01:45:14,182 --> 01:45:16,101
That's a brilliant goal!

1117
01:45:28,697 --> 01:45:30,741
President gusmao

1118
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:43,503
Pass! Pass it!

1119
01:45:43,587 --> 01:45:44,963
Come on!

1120
01:46:02,064 --> 01:46:03,815
Defense!

1121
01:46:07,402 --> 01:46:10,113
Tua passes the ball to ramos!

1122
01:46:10,197 --> 01:46:11,448
Motavio dashes as well!

1123
01:46:28,673 --> 01:46:29,800
Great!

1124
01:46:45,816 --> 01:46:47,317
Go!

1125
01:46:58,912 --> 01:47:00,330
Riki! Defense!

1126
01:47:00,872 --> 01:47:03,708
Come out! Quick!

1127
01:47:04,918 --> 01:47:06,878
Tua tosses it over to ramos.

1128
01:47:06,962 --> 01:47:09,172
Motavio charges in, too.

1129
01:47:09,589 --> 01:47:10,882
Get in!

1130
01:47:13,051 --> 01:47:15,554
One-two pass between motavio and ramos!

1131
01:47:15,637 --> 01:47:17,097
Shoot!

1132
01:47:22,227 --> 01:47:24,563
Goal!

1133
01:47:41,204 --> 01:47:45,041
Now you're confident
we can win the damn thing?

1134
01:47:46,543 --> 01:47:48,003
Winning is good.

1135
01:47:49,212 --> 01:47:51,381
But even if we lose,
there's always a next time.

1136
01:47:52,257 --> 01:47:53,466
In-gi,

1137
01:47:54,217 --> 01:47:58,054
I'm just glad that

1138
01:47:59,014 --> 01:48:00,640
this isn't the end.

1139
01:48:02,684 --> 01:48:04,144
I'm very glad.

1140
01:48:06,479 --> 01:48:07,814
Remember what I said before,

1141
01:48:09,024 --> 01:48:12,027
I could get to the finish line
if I'm with the kids?

1142
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:16,781
You said you weren't sure about it.

1143
01:48:18,825 --> 01:48:20,160
I am now.

1144
01:48:22,162 --> 01:48:24,039
Because they trust me.

1145
01:48:27,334 --> 01:48:28,919
That's all I need.

1146
01:48:40,472 --> 01:48:43,183
The score is two to two.
Now it's a tie game.

1147
01:48:43,266 --> 01:48:45,393
The people of Timor-Leste,

1148
01:48:45,894 --> 01:48:49,022
you should be proud of your players.

1149
01:48:49,105 --> 01:48:50,482
One more goal

1150
01:48:50,565 --> 01:48:54,444
and the victory is ours.

1151
01:48:56,655 --> 01:49:00,075
Tua is charging again rapidly.

1152
01:49:06,957 --> 01:49:09,501
Go! Help him!

1153
01:49:26,142 --> 01:49:27,769
Foul!

1154
01:49:28,645 --> 01:49:32,232
That's Japan's foul

1155
01:49:32,357 --> 01:49:35,860
inside the penalty area.

1156
01:49:35,944 --> 01:49:37,988
It's a penalty kick!

1157
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:40,115
It's a penalty kick!

1158
01:49:46,079 --> 01:49:48,999
The assistant referee announces
