Good evening, everyone,

4
00:00:19,540 --> 00:00:22,691
and welcome to a Powell Pay-Per-View
television event!

5
00:00:22,820 --> 00:00:26,176
It's hard to believe,
but tonight's heavyweight fight...

6
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:29,019
is the swan song for the grand
old Atlantic City Arena,

7
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:31,734
the final event to be held
in this storied hall...

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,454
before it is gutted
and completely renovated...

9
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:38,892
as part of Gilbert Powell's
Millennium Hotel and Casino.

10
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:43,093
I'm eager to go ringside
along with 14,000 fight fans...

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,609
who have braved
Hurricane Jezebel to...

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:47,537
[Man]
Cut! Cut!

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:49,855
Anthea, they want you to call it
a tropical storm, not a hurricane.

14
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,777
But it is a hurricane.

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,970
Yeah, well, it's also
a holiday weekend,

16
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,853
so will you please just call it
a tropical storm, please?

17
00:00:56,980 --> 00:00:59,016
I love this town.
They even spin the weather.

18
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,893
All right, listen. We gotta go live
on this one, so don't screw it up.

19
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,092
And, Al, I think that's Powell going
in there with Secretary Kirkland.

20
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:07,017
Zoom in on them
during the intro.

21
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,415
- Anyway, why can't
I do this from inside?
- All right, we're rolling.

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,656
- Why do I have to
stand out here like a...
- Five, four, three,

23
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,736
- a weather bimbo?
- two, one, go!

24
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,657
Good evening, everyone,

25
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,056
and welcome to a Powell Pay-Per-View
television event.

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,978
Well, the lucky ones are already
inside at the fight...

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:25,172
as the first taste
of Tropical Storm Jezebel...

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,691
lashes the boardwalk outside
the grand old Atlantic City Arena.

29
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:32,573
It's hard to believe,
but tonight's heavyweight fight...

30
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,260
is the swan song
for this storied hall.

31
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:38,053
The final event to be held here
before it is gutted...

32
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:39,977
What do we got?
Thirty, forty seconds?

33
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,056
Where's Janine?
My hair looks like shit?

34

I'm on TV?
I'm on TV?

35
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,015
Come on, for Christ's sake.
I'm on in 30 seconds. Will ya?

36
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,937
- I think people would vote
for this face. Don't you?
- Yeah, blind people.

37
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,857
That's the only way
you get anywhere these days.

38
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,936
You gotta get your big,
fat smile all over the tube.

- Oh, shit. I forgot.
You seen Jimmy George?

42
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,974
- Yeah, he's down in the tunnel.
- What tunnel?
There's a million tunnels.

43
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,330
I don't know. The tunnel of love,
over by Tyler's dressing room.

44
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,291
- Here, lay 50 for me.
- On who?

45
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:09,969
- On who? On the bag of meat,
on who! On Tyler!
- Wow! The whole 50?

46
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:13,490
- Oh, up yours, Mr High Roller...

just shoot it all?

How are you?

I was hoping it'd be you. Yeah.

Happy almost birthday.
Of course I'm still coming.

when it turns midnight.

something with me.

That's right, baby.

No. No way.
I'm not gonna give you a hint.

No... Shameless.

on a cel phone.

Yummy. All right,
I will give you a hint.

I know you really want one, and
it's going to keep you very, very warm.

- Jimmy George, wait up a sec.

I got people waiting for me.
- Hey, that's Tyler!

- [Laughs] That's Tyler!

right in front of me.

- Were you talkin' to him?
- Hey, do I ask what you do at work?

71
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,252
No shit. The man bets on his
own fights. Now that's confidence.

- What's up your ass?

on you? Let me see it.
- What are you, a bank now?

75
00:03:37,100 --> 00:03:39,568
I gotta put up front for the privilege
of betting on a lousy fight?

76
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:41,930
Yes, you do. Take it or leave it,
because I don't need the aggravation...

Have I ever stiffed you
one time, Jimmy? Name one time.

78

No, no, you never stiffed me.
It's just that you take forever to pay.

a year from next Christmas.

they are.

where any of this is my problem.

I made a promise, Jimmy.
I gave my word to someone.

to you, in your profession? Please.
- Come on.

Cash means something to me.
Words mean something to somebody else...

00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,337
Pepperoni, sausage,
Canadian bacon...

144
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,894
Listen, why don't you just get
the deluxe and save time, all right?

145
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,976
Look, I got business.
Call me back in five. There he is!

146
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,056
- You got a pass, sir?
- It's all right. He's with me.

147
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:07,889
- There's the man
whose life I want! [Laughs]
- You're late.

148
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:10,773
You know me. Always upholding justice.
When did you get in?

149
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,368
Last night. I flew in from Norfolk
with Powell and the secretary.

150
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,060
- Hey, is that him?
- Tuck in your shirt
and I'll introduce you.

151
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,092
Jesus! I get you a front row seat,
and you show up lookin' like Don Ho.

152
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,576
Well, pardon my savoir faire,
Admiral. Why are you so uptight?
It's fight night!

153
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,850
I'm runnin' security tonight.
I got a lot on my mind.

154
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,255
Kirkland's high profile.
He's all over the news...

155
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:29,336
and brings the nutcases
out of the woodwork.

156
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:31,735
He's a real publicity hound.
Look at this.

157
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:34,897
And now, the distinguished
secretary of defence...

158
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:38,456
of the United States of America,
Mr Charles Kirkland.

159

[Crowd Cheering]

160
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:45,171
And seated next to him is a man
that needs no introduction.
[Continues, Indistinct]

161
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,610
Great idea. Put a flashing light
on your head while you're at it.

162
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,777
Your host for the evening,
Mr Gilbert Powell!

on the principal, mister.
- Sorry, Commander.

- Got your locator on?
- Yes, sir.

166
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,531
- Go cover the west exit.
- Yes, sir.

167
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,811
Oh, and throw in a couple martinis
while you're at it.

168
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:10,899
- It's fight night.
- Look. See that blip? That's him.

169
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:14,695
Look at you, 007.
Man, I'm so impressed.

170
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:16,936
I wanna get your
autograph or somethin'.

171
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:19,449
I can picture us like yesterday,
workin' summers on the beach,

172
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:21,616
carrying the oars back
across the hot sand.

173
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,696
No, me I can picture
carrying the oars.

174
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:26,778
You were usually under the boardwalk
with a cute piece of jailbait.

175
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:29,653
- It's me, your lucky number!
- Listen, I gotta
hit you up for something.

176
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:32,817
Mikey's crazy about
submarines right now. I mean,
everything's submarines with him,

177
00:08:32,940 --> 00:08:35,056
and he wanted me to ask you
if you'd get him a ride on one.

178
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:37,614
Well, sure, Rick. We'll dock the Polaris
right out at the steel pier.

179
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,253
Come on. This is the kind
of thing godfathers do. Come with us.

180
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:41,610
I promise I won't
embarrass the brass.

181
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:44,095
I haven't been on the water
since the Renville, but I'll
pull some strings for Michael.

182
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:46,017
- How's Angela?
- Fat, fantastic. I love her.

183
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:48,131
What about the other one?
What's her name? Candy?

184
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,252
Monique. Skinny, mean, expensive.
I love her.

Go, baby! Yeah!

190
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:10,170
You got a wife, a kid,
a house in Margate,

191
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,097
a girlfriend
and an apartment.

Bein' a cop

I save coupons.
Are you my conscience?

194
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,130
You could use one.
Does Angela know about Monique?

195
00:09:18,260 --> 00:09:21,013
See, now there's a good idea. What are
you gonna do, turn me in again?

196
00:09:21,140 --> 00:09:24,098
That was just to teach you a lesson.
You never shoplifted again, did you?

197
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,178
- No, I never got caught again.
Angela's happy, trust me.
- Angela's not happy.

198
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,656
She's just uninformed. Maybe if she knew
the rules, she could play the game too.

199
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,611
Listen, if Angela knew the rules,
there would be no game.

200
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,731
Rule number one:
Angela can't know all the rules.

201
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:37,693
Look, I'm not like you,
Kevin. I can't have sex
with the same woman for 20 years.

202
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,175
- It's not natural.
- Terry likes to talk to me during sex.

- Last night, she called me from a hotel.

Kevin, that is right
in so many ways.

No, I mean, who's she with?
Not the guy next to her.

Beautiful woman

Sexy lady.
What's the problem?

You've gotta get outta this town.
You know that, don't you?

Would you stop going
all Jiminy Cricket on me.
You can't help yourself, can you?

00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:11,055
No, really. I mean,
get your butt down to D.C.

All right, all right. You gotta fix
my life later. I got money on this.

This isn't a beach town
any more. It's a sewer.

But it's my sewer, Jiminy,
and I love it.

00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:34,294
I kick around about six square blocks.
Everybody knows me.

I got the whole town wired. Someday if I
manage to get my face on TV a few times,

224
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:40,659
maybe I'll run for mayor or something,
but that's as far as I want to go.

shown to a heavyweight
champion in the ring since...

sooner or later...

- Or hating it.
- Or hating it. Exactly.

What they came to see
tonight was a professional
heavyweight championship fight,

and that is not
what they're getting,

to agree with you.

Oh, yeah?
Screw you, man!

287
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,697
Tommy, get this scum
out of here!

288
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:26,251
- Oh, Jesus.
- There were two hits.
The girl next to me,

289
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,099
she threatened him, took something,
got shot and ran away.

[Screaming Continues]

291
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,577
- Oh, my God!
- Shut down the arena.

292
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,533
- Shit. Is he dead?
- Get on your goddam radio
and shut down the arena!

293
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,456
- Hey, be careful!
- Let go of me!

294
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,696
- What happened to you?
- Would you please ju...

295
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,095
- What's going on? Come back here!
- Let go of me!

296
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:56,211
Let's get this gurney up!
Let's go!

297
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,615
Come on, make a hole through there!
Get that crowd outta the way!

298
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:02,255
Come on! Tell him to bring
that ambulance through the main
entrance into the arena tunnel!

299
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:05,816
You're gonna be all right.
You are gonna be all right, Charles.

300
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:09,012
You're going to the hospital
right now. You're gonna be okay.
You have my word on that.

301
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:12,018
Come on, come on! Get those people
outta the tunnel! Move it, there!

302
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,654
He's gonna die, Rick.
This is my fault.

303
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:17,533
I should never have left my seat.
I opened up a sight line.

304
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,016
I was off the deck. What the hell
was I doing? This is my fault!

305
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:24,735
What the hell is the matter
with you? Don't talk shit
like that where people can hear.

306
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:28,978
You don't understand.
I pulled rank on regular detail
and took command of security.

307
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,570
I told them the secretary
would be better protected
with me running the operation,

308
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:37,012
because I know the area, the layout of
the arena and the local law enforcement.

309
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,610
I get assigned, I step
out of position, the secretary
takes a bullet in the throat.

310
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,857
- Why were you out of position?
- I should never have left him.
I could be court-martialled!

311
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:47,529
That is not gonna happen!
We're not gonna let that happen.
Do you understand?

312
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:50,049
You are not going to prison,
so you just forget about that!

313
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:52,535
All right, back up.
Why were you out of position?

314
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,699
The girl... the redhead...
I went over to check her out.

315
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,254
She ran, and
I followed her up here.

316
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:01,848
Don't say "redhead" and don't say
"girl." Say "suspicious character."

317
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,891
You followed a suspicious character,
and when you got up here,

318
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:06,056
you saw an assassin fire,
so you took him out, end of story.

319
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:08,933
Rick, leaving my post is dereliction
of duty. It's gross negligence.

320
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,211
You killed the assassin!
You saved the day!

321

You're a hero, Kevin. That's what
happened, and that's how we'll spin it.

322

- Screw procedure!

323

Look, who do you think
you're talking to?

324

I'm not some beat cop that needs
you to plant a piece for him.

325
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:26,695
Kevin, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to cover my ass.

326
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:28,731
I see this shit happen
every day.

is gonna change the rest of your life.

They're gaming enforcement.

They're gonna try and muscle us,
but we're not gonna let that happen.

If we're first contact when the feds get
here, everybody writes from our report,

334

because we say so.

so that's an hour,

maybe an hour and a half
with the storm.

340

So we just gotta fight these

and you're in the clear, okay?

- It isn't lying!

and you leave out the rest!

an officer-involved shooting.

347

Secretary Kirkland
was shot in the neck.

348
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:35,656
Paramedics just wheeled him out,
and that's the perpetrator.

took him out during the shooting.

It's the secretary's.
I was sitting right in front of him.

business in the casino.

Gordo! And this arena
ain't the Millennium yet!

It's Atlantic City, New Jersey,
and that belongs to me!

by appropriate federal authority!

you go tell your men to get all
the media outta here right now!

and 14,000 phone numbers...

00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,570
You said, she, uh...
she took something. What was it?

377
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:56,089
- It was in a manila
envelope about this big.
- What did she look like?

378
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:58,973
Caucasian, late 20's,
dressed in white, blood everywhere.

379
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,216
She had a blonde wig,
dark hair underneath.

every uniform you can get.

Could you give us the identity
of the assassin, please?

- Sir, how does it feel to be a hero?
- Hey, you, get outta here.

385
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,818
We told you never to talk to the people
here. No press in the arena.

386
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,649
I said no press inside the arena, Lou.
Not in the arena!

these other assholes outta here,

you were talking about me too!

of break this is for me?

they make statements,

they always have one pool reporter
asking all the questions.

always be there for you, my friend.

00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,854
- Hey, come on, Rick.
I got people waiting for me.
- Hey. Hey. Hey!

571
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:47,132
- That's Tyler!
- Hey, what are you looking at?
Go buy a ticket.

572
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:49,649
You are never
gonna get away with this.

573
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,771
- Get out of my face, Mickey.
- Look at me!

574
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:54,016
- No. No, no, no, no, no!
- Look at yourself!

575
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:57,177
Bleed, Mickey! Bleed!
You taught me that.

576
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,131
[Grunting]
Remember?

577
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,694
No, no. No way, man.
You got yourself into this.

578
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:04,254
You get caught,
you lose my phone number.

579
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,336
I told you,
you can't live like you do.

580
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:09,213
You make yourself vulnerable.
Everybody wants a piece of you.

581
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:13,697
- Well, look at this, man.
They got all of you now.
- [Grunts]

582
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:17,130
That's beautiful. That is...
That's terrif... That's great.

583
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:20,138
- That's great. Jesus Christ!
- Mickey?

584
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,820
- Yeah? Cyrus, here.
- Come on, Mickey. I got bills to pay.

585
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:26,250
- Take that and get lost.
- Best of the best, right, Mr Tyler?

586
00:30:26,380 --> 00:30:30,168
- Come on, get outta here. Move along.
- Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

587
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:32,256
Tyler!
[Grunting]

588
00:30:32,380 --> 00:30:34,336
Tyler! Ty...

589
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:37,213
- Words mean something to somebody else...
- All right, don't move.

590
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:40,616
- I'll be right back. Cyrus! Cyrus!
- Yo, yo.

591
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,856
- Cyrus!
- Yo!

592
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:47,093
How much were you
into the casinos for?

593
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,457
Enough.

594
00:30:50,580 --> 00:30:53,299
The people that set this up
said if I dropped this one,

595
00:30:53,420 --> 00:30:55,536
they'd square
everything I owed.

596
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:59,573
Plus, if I lose to an underdog,
it would set me up for a rematch,

597
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,930
and the rematch
is where the real money is.

598
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,654
They didn't say what round
they wanted it in.

599
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:08,375
They were gonna let me know during the
fight. There was a guy in the front row.

600
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:12,288
They told me what he was gonna say, and
he was gonna be the signal to go down.

601
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,536
I ain't never
gonna forget those words:

602
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,776
"Here comes the pain."

603
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:23,217
It was all I could do to keep from
taking him out. Just one punch.

604
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,900
Shove that radio right through
the side of his head.

605
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:28,136
- Radio?
- Yeah.

606
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:31,093
He had one of those things
in his ear.

607
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:34,053
Anyway, the fight started.

608
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:36,091
Come on, man.
Come on, old man.

609
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,290
Let's see
what you got, old man.

610
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,651
- I couldn't get that sack of shit
to take a decent swing at me.
- Is that all you got?

611
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,216
He wouldn't stop talking, like he
was gonna bullshit me to death.

612
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:47,854
Gotta do better than that.
Come on, baby! Ohhh!

613
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,699
Come on, now!
You're too slow, old man. Come on!

614
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:53,414
What you gonna do to me, huh?
[Grunting]

615
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,138
[Laughs]
That's what I'm talking about.

616
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:03,889
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah!

617
00:32:04,020 --> 00:32:07,012
Come on, baby! Come on!
Come on! Let's see what you got!

618
00:32:07,140 --> 00:32:09,700
Let me see what you got, old man.
Come on, bring it to me.

619
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:12,015
Come on! Come on!
Yeah!

620
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,529
- [Grunting]
- [Laughing]

621
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,295
Yeah, I'm right here.
I'm right here.

622
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:30,459
What are you trying to do
with that stuff you got?
Come on. You're too slow!

623
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,333
I was just trying
to shut him up.

624
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,576
I barely even tapped him,

625
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,214
and I almost won the fight.

626
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,137
[Rick In Audience]
Go, Sea Devils!

627
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:44,048
[Referee]
One, two...

628
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:48,537
three, four...

629
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:52,171
five...

630
00:32:53,380 --> 00:32:56,019
six...

631
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:58,495
seven...

632
00:33:00,300 --> 00:33:02,768
eight...

633
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,970
[Sighs]

634
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,580
- Are you okay?
- Yeah. Yeah.

635
00:33:12,060 --> 00:33:14,369
Get it on!

636
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,297
[Grunting]

637
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:19,059
You punch like a bitch!
This is a fight! Get...

638
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,977
[Crowd Booing]

639
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:24,137
And he did head-butt me.
I wasn't lying about that.

640
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,252
Everything went wrong. It was like
he was trying to screw up the deal.

641
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:29,177
- I'll stop the fight.
- No!

642
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:31,416
- Right after that, I got the signal.
- Are you all right?

643
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:33,656
- Are you sure?
- It was quicker than I thought.

644
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,453
- Maybe they were getting nervous.
- Let's get it on.

645
00:33:36,580 --> 00:33:40,937
Here comes the pain, baby!
Here comes the pain!

646
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:45,099
- Here comes the pain!
- I showed you what it's about!

647
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,132
I wasn't supposed to go down right away.
They were very clear about that.

648
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:51,696
I had to take a punch, fall
back into the corner,
let him charge in and knock me out...

649
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:54,209
because they wanted everybody
up on their feet, distracted,

650
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,093
giving him a clear shot
right through the count.

651
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:00,417
But that punkass son of a bitch
didn't sweep through the punch,

652
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:03,930
and I was so far into the act
in my own head, you know,

653
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:07,450
by the time I realized he didn't
connect, I was already in the corner.

654
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,295
- [Grunting]
- You're a bum, Tyler!

655
00:34:12,420 --> 00:34:15,730
How could you do this to me?
He's a bum!

656
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,374
Get back!
Neutral corners.

657
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:21,412
Get back! Stay there!

658
00:34:21,540 --> 00:34:24,532
One... two...

659
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,015
three... four...

660
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,132
[Gunshots, Screaming]

661
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,569
But nobody
was supposed to die.

662
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:42,659
- She never said anything about that.
- She? She?

663
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,578
- [Thunder Rumbling]
- You hear that storm out there?

664
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:48,976
- I wish it would blow
this whole town away.
- No, no, no. Who's she?

665
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:52,012
She's the one who came to me
in the first place, told me
I was supposed to go down.

666
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,893
- I never met anybody else but her.
- Did you get a name?

667
00:34:55,020 --> 00:34:58,729
Yeah, name, address, serial
number, 8 by 10 colour picture.
You wanna look at that too?

668
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:01,533
Do you remember anything
unusual about her?

669
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,776
- Her hair, maybe.
- What about it?

670
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,052
It was bright red,
like it was on fire.

671
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:11,969
A Palestinian who's lived in the
United States for the last six years.

672
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:15,490
He's believed to be linked
to a series of threatening letters...

673
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:18,498
written to various defence secretaries
expressing outrage...

674
00:35:18,620 --> 00:35:21,692
over the sale of missile systems
and other weaponry to Israel.

675
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,699
A handwritten note
was found on Rabat's body.

676
00:35:25,820 --> 00:35:27,811
Would you hold that
up too, please?

677
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,500
Apparently he intended it
to be found after the shooting.

678
00:35:30,620 --> 00:35:32,497
Uh, Commander, what's
in the note, sir?

679
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:35,373
I can't disclose that until
it's been studied by investigators.

680
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:38,731
Commander, could you give us the
condition of the secretary, please?

681
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,454
He was taken
to Atlantic City Medical Center,

682
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:44,333
but, uh, I have no other
information at this time.

683
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:47,179
That's all I can say until the F.B.I.
joins the investigation.

684
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:50,451
Thank you, Commander.
That was Commander Kevin Dunne.
[Continues, Indistinct]

685
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:53,413
- Did you find her?
- No. She might have gone
into the casino.

686
00:35:53,540 --> 00:35:56,498
There's a dozen service doors from here
to there. We couldn't watch all of them.

687
00:35:56,620 --> 00:35:59,532
- Well, double the men you
have at the casino exits.
- I gotta talk to you.

688
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:02,538
- What is it?
- Let's go somewhere private.

689
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:05,538
Just because a guy has something plugged
into his ear doesn't mean...

690
00:36:05,660 --> 00:36:07,855
I asked.
Tyler says it was a radio.

691
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:12,656
Okay, we'll check it out.
But a compulsive gambler
who admits he took a dive...

692
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,055
might not turn out
to be the best witness in the world.

693
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:18,297
It's not just him.
I'm betting the redhead is the person
who told Tyler to throw the fight.

694
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:22,299
She's one, shooter's two, Tyler's three,
the drunk who shouted the signal's four,

695
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:25,332
and whoever was on the other end
of that radio is five.

696
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:28,657
Five people
make a conspiracy, right?

697
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:31,578
Yeah, yeah. Look, anything's possible,
but I gotta tell you...

698
00:36:31,700 --> 00:36:34,373
we got a file an inch thick
on this guy Rabat.

699
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:38,209
He's a well-known nutcase. It was clear
he was ready to die for his cause.

700
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:40,535
That's a suicide note.

701
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:43,618
You know, "I fly into the arms
of Allah," shit like that.

702
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:46,379
He was all worked up
about our missile sales to Israel,

703
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:50,209
and it's conceivable that he found out
about the Norfolk test.

704
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,730
Norfolk test?
What's that?

705
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:59,298
Kevin, I know it's classified,
but I am the investigating officer
in a murder now.

706
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:06,209
All right. But what are you
chasing this for?

707
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:09,412
You don't get out of bed unless
there's an angle in it for you.

708
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:12,976
Guys get elected president
just for being in the right place
at the right time.

709
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,897
I only want to be mayor.

710
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:21,292
Look, part of what
I'm going to tell you,

711
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:24,412
it could bury me.

712
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,610
I hope you can keep this
between us.

713
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:30,210
Kevin, you're talking
to your best friend.

714
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:33,491
And loyalty's my only vice.
So what's the problem?

715
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:37,010
The problem is that
I was in too good a mood.

716
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,612
That trip to Norfolk
was for a weapons test...

717
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:45,891
for the AirGuard, Powell's
new antimissile defence system.

718
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,818
It's light years ahead of the
Sea Sparrows our ships have now.

719
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:53,730
If we had this in the Gulf
when the Renville...

720
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:57,489
After the Renville incident the old man
picked me to sell it to congress.

721
00:37:57,620 --> 00:38:01,295
Everybody at D.O.D. wanted it to work,
and it did. The test went beautifully.

722
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,333
By the time we got to the fight
tonight, we were all high as kites.

723
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:09,738
I let the excitement get to me.
I lost my edge.

724
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:13,216
- [Dunne]
Can I see your ticket, please?
- My what?

725
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:16,218
Your ticket, ma'am.
I need to see your ticket for this seat.

726
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:19,969
Oh, my ticket. Um, yeah, sure.
I think I have it here.

727
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,250
[Fighters Punching]

[Crowd Cheering]

729
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,497
[Dunne]
Hey!

730
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:50,296
[Dunne] Hold on a minute.
I was talking to you back there.

731
00:38:50,420 --> 00:38:52,376
Where do you think
you're going?

732
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,616
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Is that okay with you?

733
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,971
In the middle of the first round?
You're not much of a fight fan, I guess.

734
00:38:58,100 --> 00:39:00,614
Look, uh, Sarge,
I don't know who you are,

735
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,095
but you have no right
to hassle me like this.

736
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:07,293
I get paid
to hassle people. Show me your ticket,
or I'll have you escorted out.

737
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:10,730
Okay, okay. I don't have a ticket.
I mean, I have a ticket,

738
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:13,738
but it's way up there
in the nosebleed seats...

739
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,772
and I-I couldn't
see a thing, so...

740
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:20,609
Listen, I do this all the time.
They always let me get away with it.

741
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,652
- Come on. It's no big deal.
- It is tonight.

742
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:27,489
- What's so special about tonight?
- Very important man in the crowd.

743
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:32,933
Oh. And you're, uh,
what, his bodyguard?

744
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,609
That must be
a very exciting job.

745
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,415
- Yeah, it's got its moments.
- [Silenced Gunshots]

746
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:54,016
I was three feet away
from a known terrorist,

747
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:59,294
and I had my eyes buried
in some broad's tits.

748
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,093
Well, Kevin, this might not make you
feel better, but don't you see?

749
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:04,939
That's what she was there for.
That was the plan.

750
00:40:05,060 --> 00:40:07,290
To give you a boner.
And you got one.

751
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:11,413
- Congratulations. You're human.
- Come on, Rick.

752
00:40:11,540 --> 00:40:14,816
Look on the bright side. I like you
better. Golden boy screwed up.

753
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:19,297
Wait a minute. We need to be very,
very careful with this.

754
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,015
We go out there and yell conspiracy,
it's like waving a lunatic flag.

755
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,496
We gotta get our hands on the redhead
or the guy that shouted the signal.

756
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,417
If they're still
in the building.

757
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,371
And the woman who was
talking to the secretary.

758
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:32,616
I'll stay after her,
and you find the other two.

759
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:36,449
No, no. This is wrong.
We're never gonna find
anything just walking around the arena.

760
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:39,048
What if they've gone into the casino?
I'm going up to surveillance.

761
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:41,535
They've got cameras all over the place.
Just bitchin' technology.

762
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:45,369
All right,
you do that while I check with security,
see if they found anything.

763
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,217
[Lock Beeping]

[Thunder Rumbling]

765
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:31,340
Well, I finally understand
why you didn't want me
to worry about your shooter.

766
00:41:31,460 --> 00:41:33,974
One less terrorist
in the world.

767
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:37,297
At least he did something
productive on his way out.

768
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,570
Did he know he was
on a suicide mission?

769
00:41:41,420 --> 00:41:43,615
He does now.

770
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:47,016
With all due respect, sir, we should
have been out of here 11 minutes ago.

771
00:41:48,660 --> 00:41:51,174
[Sighs]
Things have changed.

772
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:55,534
We need to make
an adjustment.

773
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,499
A local cop
made both of you.

774
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:02,259
- What?
- Made us? How?

775
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:06,009
It's not important. He's searching
the building for you right now.

776
00:42:06,140 --> 00:42:08,335
So what do we do?
Take him out?

777
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,576
- That's not an option.
- It's the only option.

778
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:13,851
Negative.
Not with this guy.

779
00:42:13,980 --> 00:42:17,211
- Let's move out.
- Yes, sir.

780
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:20,252
You do have a contingency plan,
don't you, sir?

781
00:42:20,380 --> 00:42:23,019
- Yes, but I don't like it.
- Why not?

782
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:25,096
Because a soldier
deserves better.

No problem. You think one of these
people's your shooter?

793
00:42:59,940 --> 00:43:02,852
- We already got the shooter.
- Then, what are you looking for?

- Coin cup grabber.
Look. Watch the money.

- You know him?
- Nah, you just get to read

There he goes.
There he goes.

See, somebody
wants to play the slots,

805
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:40,532
they're staring at the machines trying
to guess which one's lucky.

806
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:43,174
Grabber could care less.
He checks out the people.

807
00:43:43,300 --> 00:43:46,895
He's like a pickpocket,
only crude, you know? No skills.

808

- Keep going?
- Keep going.

Ooh, God, I'm hot.

00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:48,178
- Do you have air conditioning?
- Huh?

827
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:52,213
- In your room, air conditioning.
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:54,854
- Yeah?
- I keep it turned down real low.

What you want?

00:45:02,460 --> 00:45:05,452
I need a word
with Mr Tyler.

I want to apologize, sir,
for not securing the infra-reds.

There was nothing you could do.

in the Princess Lounge.

- Hey.
- And if you don't come with me,
I'm sure somebody else will.

00:48:17,140 --> 00:48:18,937
Shit!

862
00:48:21,220 --> 00:48:25,133
- I missed her. Got her on the box?
- Yeah, Ricky, I got 'em.

863
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:29,094
I'm taking this elevator.
Tell me what floor they're on.

864
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:31,336
So, what kind of music
do you like?

865
00:48:31,460 --> 00:48:34,213
- Ow! What?
- I'm sorry. I just wanted a hug.

866
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:40,017
- What floor?
- Thirty-five. What?

867
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:42,813
- What?
- Nothing.

868
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:45,454
I just want
to get upstairs.

869
00:48:47,700 --> 00:48:49,975
Walt, I gotta know
what floor.

870
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:52,614
I can't make out the buttons.
It's a high one.

871
00:48:52,740 --> 00:48:55,379
Can you pick 'em up
when they get off?

872
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:58,253
I'd have to check
floor by floor. I'd lose 'em.

873
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:02,818
Hang on.
I got an idea.

Yeah, this is McGahn in Security.

staying at the hotel?

No, wait. It's going up.

important than me, baby?

Look at me.
Look at me! Yeah!

890
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,128
- Honey, there's a hurricane on.
- So what? I'm hot.

891
00:51:08,260 --> 00:51:10,899
- Come on!
- Oh, you wanna play rough, huh?

Secretary of Defence Charles Kirkland...

00:51:18,620 --> 00:51:21,453
is in critical condition at the
Atlantic City Medical Center...

896
00:51:21,580 --> 00:51:23,810
after being struck
by an assassin's bullet...

while attending a boxing match
at the Atlantic City Arena.

We've also learned that Rabat
left a suicide note...

Hi. I hope you don't mind.
I borrowed your shirt.

909
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:42,058
Oh, not at all. I happen to think women
look very sexy in men's shirts.

Excuse me! You're the one
who was practically giving me
the knob job down in the bar.

I'm sorry. I need a place where
I can just wait, and then I'll go.

A place where you can just wait and go.
Well, what do you think this is,

[Shouts]
a bus stop?

What, are you on drugs? I should've
figured this out. You look like hell.

00:53:18,180 --> 00:53:20,933
Did you come up here to rob me?
Is that what you were thinking?

921
00:53:21,060 --> 00:53:25,133
- Look, I'm in trouble.
Somebody shot at me, okay?
- Now I've heard everything. Go.

922
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:28,013
Do you know what's going on tonight?
Have you heard?

923
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:31,132
Listen, I am a very happily married man,
and I don't need your kind of trouble.

924
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:33,728
- So let's go.
- Just a half an hour.

- No, wait, please! [Screams]
- Get out!

- It's all right.
- Who are you?

927
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:40,296
- Take a walk.
- What the hell's going on here?

928
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:42,695
I said take a walk!

It's my room, damn it!

Hi. Remember me?
I'm Detective Santoro.

- I shoved you out of the way
of that bullet.
- Yeah.

00:53:52,180 --> 00:53:53,977
Can you please help me?
I need to get out of this building.

933
00:53:54,100 --> 00:53:55,897
The first thing we're gonna do is
get you outta this room.

934
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:02,612
- So you can calm down.
We're gonna have a little talk, okay?
- Yeah.

935
00:54:02,740 --> 00:54:05,493
This hotel sucks!

936
00:54:05,620 --> 00:54:08,293
- What's the problem?
- Some guy just busted into my room.

937
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:11,332
- What guy? Where?
- Come on. I'll show ya.

938
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:19,017
There I am, minding my own business,
writing a letter to my lovely wife,

939
00:54:19,140 --> 00:54:21,574
and some guy
just busts in.

940
00:54:35,580 --> 00:54:39,812
She must've gone with him.
Hey, is that a silencer?

941
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,737
What did he look like?

942
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:46,977
- Where are we going?
What's the matter with you?
- H-He's following me.

943
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:49,853
You're with me now.
You're safe. I'm a cop.

944
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,414
I'm gonna protect you
and serve you.

945
00:54:52,540 --> 00:54:57,170
We got a very cosy little
step here, so why don't we
just sit down and calm down.

946
00:54:57,300 --> 00:55:00,098
- Take a deep breath. How's your arm?
- Oh, it's fine, thanks.

947
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:02,051
- You're not gonna die on me?
- No.

948
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:04,136
- We can talk for a minute?
- Yeah.

949
00:55:04,260 --> 00:55:07,093
Okay.

950
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:10,212
- Uh, no, thank you.
- [Thunder Rumbling]

951
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,298
Um, why'd you run
away from me?

952
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:18,450
You know what? I don't know.
I don't know what I'm doing.

953
00:55:18,580 --> 00:55:20,696
All right. I'm not interested
in what you don't know.

954
00:55:20,820 --> 00:55:25,416
What I'm interested in
is what you do know. Please.

955
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:28,612
Okay. Um...

956
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:31,777
I, uh, I work
at Powell Aircraft.

957
00:55:31,900 --> 00:55:35,176
I put together the ballistics reports
we issue after weapons tests.

958
00:55:35,300 --> 00:55:38,019
- You're talking about missiles?
- Right.

959
00:55:38,140 --> 00:55:40,973
Now, the newest missile, the AirGuard,
I've been tracking its results...

960
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:43,739
for the past couple of months,
and they are perfect.

961
00:55:43,860 --> 00:55:47,409
These tests are never perfect,
so I knew something was wrong,

962
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,179
but I didn't know
who I could trust.

963
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:52,768
I sent an anonymous E-mail
to Secretary Kirkland...

964
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:56,290
telling him that I suspected
that these results were doctored.

965
00:55:56,420 --> 00:56:00,891
He actually wrote me back,
and he told me to get him proof.

966
00:56:01,020 --> 00:56:05,491
Yesterday, I got it, and I told him that
I wanted to give it to him in person.

967
00:56:05,620 --> 00:56:07,895
He told me to bring it
to the fight tonight.

968
00:56:08,020 --> 00:56:10,932
[Woman] Secretary Kirkland,
welcome to Atlantic City.
Are you here on official business?

969
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:13,893
Not for a couple of hours.
I'm just another fight fan.

970
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:17,808
[Julia]
I couldn't get near him when they
first came in. Powell was all over him.

971
00:56:17,940 --> 00:56:20,295
The South Jersey worker
we are interested in tonight...

972
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:22,251
is the Atlantic City
Executioner.

973
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,292
[Julia] So I decided
to wait until the fight started.

974
00:56:25,420 --> 00:56:30,096
And I had no idea
where they were sitting,
so I went up top to get a better view.

975
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:44,055
[Cheering, Shouting]

976
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:23,139
[Rick] All right.
Hold it, hold it. Stop right there.

977
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:25,649
This is Dunne
you're talking about.

978
00:57:25,780 --> 00:57:29,295
- Naval uniform? Commander Kevin Dunne?
- Right.

979
00:57:29,420 --> 00:57:31,934
- Talking with Rabat
before he shoots Kirkland?
- Yeah.

980
00:57:32,060 --> 00:57:34,290
- I recognized him,
and I'd just seen him come in.
- No, then you saw wrong.

981
00:57:34,420 --> 00:57:37,093
It wasn't Dunne.
He could not be a part of it.

982
00:57:37,220 --> 00:57:40,610
Will you just listen
to the rest?

983
00:58:06,340 --> 00:58:09,138
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- [Man] That seat's taken.

984
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,535
Oh, but you
can sit here.

985
00:58:11,660 --> 00:58:13,935
- Well, I'll just need one minute.
- Me too.

986
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:17,496
[Laughs]
It's in the pocket.

987
00:58:17,620 --> 00:58:19,576
- Excuse me. Did you say something?
- It's in the pocket.

988
00:58:19,700 --> 00:58:22,294
- Possible make.
- Pocket?

989
00:58:22,420 --> 00:58:25,492
- So you've been writing to me.
- Just look in the envelope,
Mr Secretary.

990
00:58:25,620 --> 00:58:28,453
- What is it?
- It's the satellite infra-reds
from yesterday's tests.

991
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:31,492
- They gave me those.
They showed convergent impact.
- They gave you doctored copies.

992
00:58:31,620 --> 00:58:33,576
- These are the originals from
the proving ground computers.
- Make is good. Stand by.

993
00:58:33,700 --> 00:58:35,850
- Please, just look for yourself.
- [Paper Rustling]

994
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:38,414
- Okay.
- [Dunne] She has the infra-reds.

995
00:58:38,540 --> 00:58:40,656
I need you to look at the heat flashes
here at the moment of impact.

996
00:58:40,780 --> 00:58:42,611
- If the AirGuard had made full
intercept like it's supposed to,
- Start the count.

997
00:58:42,740 --> 00:58:45,049
- Copy.
- there would be one dot,
but there's two every time.

998
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:47,933
The target blows up, but the AirGuard
never gets within ten metres of it.

999
00:58:48,060 --> 00:58:50,051
- Then why would the target blow up?
- Bring on the pain, baby!

1000
00:58:50,180 --> 00:58:52,978
Because they rigged it, Mr Secretary.
They put on a fireworks display for you.

1001
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:56,012
The AirGuard doesn't work, and the
company knows the system doesn't work,

1002
00:58:56,140 --> 00:58:58,290
but they're pushing it
through anyway.

1003
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,651
I know what they're thinking...
we get it approved now,
say we're sorry and fix it later.

1004
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,055
But I am telling you,

[Powell On TV]
I just received word...

1152
01:08:22,260 --> 01:08:25,138
Secretary Charles Evans
Kirkland is dead.

1153
01:08:25,260 --> 01:08:28,889
He passed away
at 10:48 p.m.

1154
01:08:29,020 --> 01:08:31,693
At this time I'd like to extend
my deepest sympathies...

1155
01:08:31,820 --> 01:08:33,890
to the secretary's family...

1156
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,617
[Louder]
and to the nation...

1157

and to the people that
he so faithfully and proudly served.

1160

I have something else
to say.

1161
01:08:53,740 --> 01:08:56,891
To those that would try
to bully us or to terrorize us,

1162
01:08:57,020 --> 01:09:01,332

of peace and justice,

[Whispers]
Kevin.

1164
01:09:03,500 --> 01:09:06,776
I want you to know that in spite of
what's happened here tonight,

1165
01:09:06,900 --> 01:09:09,016
we are not deterred.

01:09:09,140 --> 01:09:13,770
Production of the AirGuard
missile system will go ahead...

Why did it
have to be me?

Why'd you want me
next to you?

1172
01:09:31,220 --> 01:09:34,656
One, I needed a cop
to back up my alibi.

Two,

1174
01:09:37,180 --> 01:09:40,092
I knew you could be bought
if anything went wrong.

1175
01:09:40,220 --> 01:09:43,690
No offence, pal, but I never thought
you'd get as far as you did.

1176
01:09:43,820 --> 01:09:46,937
You're my best friend.

1177
01:09:47,060 --> 01:09:49,779
You used me,

1178
01:09:49,900 --> 01:09:53,336
made me a sucker,

1179
01:09:53,460 --> 01:09:55,496
and that hurts me,

1180
01:09:55,620 --> 01:09:59,579
because I would've done
anything for you.

1181
01:09:59,700 --> 01:10:04,057
Then tell me
where the girl is.

1182
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:07,013
She didn't do nothing wrong. She was
just trying to save some guys' lives,

1183
01:10:07,140 --> 01:10:08,937
soldiers,
like you used to be.

1184
01:10:09,060 --> 01:10:10,857
I mean, who the hell
are you now, anyway?

1185
01:10:10,980 --> 01:10:13,414
Don't talk to me
about soldiers.

1186
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,735
What do you know
about being a good soldier,

1187
01:10:15,860 --> 01:10:18,169
the guy who finds an envelope full
of cash in a squad car every Friday?

1188
01:10:18,300 --> 01:10:20,177
What do you think I've been doing
for the last ten years?

1189
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:23,929
Strutting on the boardwalk
and picking up hookers?

1190
01:10:24,060 --> 01:10:26,938
When the Renville took that
Iraqi missile hit below decks,

1191
01:10:27,060 --> 01:10:29,096
do you know what happened?

1192
01:10:29,220 --> 01:10:33,099
A hole ripped open in the bulkhead,
and the sea flooded in.

1193
01:10:33,220 --> 01:10:36,451
We had 60 seconds to maintain
watertight integrity.

1194
01:10:36,580 --> 01:10:38,855
I had to go below and give the order
to dog the hatches.

1195
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:42,370
That meant...
that 28 men...

1196
01:10:42,500 --> 01:10:46,459
that were still in
the main engine space were trapped.

1197
01:10:48,700 --> 01:10:51,498
You ever listen
to a man drowning?

1198
01:10:53,660 --> 01:10:55,730
They don't die quietly.

1199
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,852
Those men deserved
a decent point defence system.

1200
01:11:00,980 --> 01:11:03,016
The AirGuard is it.

1201
01:11:03,140 --> 01:11:05,813
Yeah, it has glitches, but...

1202
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:09,012
you don't abandon the whole system
because of a few bugs.

1203
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:11,096
You fix it.

1204

Charles Kirkland...

1205
01:11:13,300 --> 01:11:15,336
was a politician.

1206
01:11:15,460 --> 01:11:18,293
A baby kisser,
not a soldier.

1207
01:11:18,420 --> 01:11:21,651
And when the political wind
said, "Cut defence spending,"

1208
01:11:21,780 --> 01:11:25,534
he started playing political games
with real soldiers' lives.

1209
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:27,890
He forced Powell
into an early test.

1210
01:11:28,020 --> 01:11:31,171
He positioned the system to fail,
because he didn't want to pay for it.

1211
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:33,336
So we pay.

1212
01:11:34,660 --> 01:11:37,174
We die.

for you to look the other way
like you have all your life?

01:28:28,980 --> 01:28:31,414
Only one thing's changed
since then...

1456
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:33,496
lights are brighter.

1457
01:28:34,980 --> 01:28:38,211
- I'm naive.
- There's worse things to be.

1458
01:28:40,260 --> 01:28:42,376
Yeah.

1459
01:28:45,300 --> 01:28:48,815
How old are you?

1460
01:28:48,940 --> 01:28:50,737
Thirty-five.

1461
01:28:50,860 --> 01:28:53,613
- You got family around here?
- Yeah.

1462
01:28:54,860 --> 01:28:56,976
You got a wife?

1463
01:28:57,100 --> 01:28:59,489
She ran away.

1464
01:28:59,620 --> 01:29:04,057
- Girlfriend?
- Well, she ran away too.

1465
01:29:04,180 --> 01:29:07,058
- Sorry.
- Well, it could've been worse.

1466
01:29:07,180 --> 01:29:10,013
- How?
- They could've run away with each other.

1467
01:29:10,140 --> 01:29:12,017
[Laughs]

1468
01:29:12,140 --> 01:29:14,335
Uh, yeah.

1469
01:29:14,460 --> 01:29:19,215
So, maybe in about 12 to 18 months
from now I'll give you a call.

1470
01:29:20,380 --> 01:29:22,655
Yeah, I'd like that.

1471
01:29:27,700 --> 01:29:29,691
Hey.

1472
01:29:49,580 --> 01:29:54,335
Oh, what the hell.
At least I got to be on TV.

1473
01:29:54,460 --> 01:29:57,372
Come on. Let's go.
Get back to work.

1474
01:29:57,500 --> 01:30:00,173
You guys get this done.
Come on. Everybody up. Let's go.

1475
01:30:00,300 --> 01:30:02,097
Come on.
We ain't got much sun left.

1476
01:30:02,220 --> 01:30:04,859
 In this town of pain 

1477
01:30:04,980 --> 01:30:08,893
 You could be the lucky one 

1478
01:30:09,020 --> 01:30:12,217
 Fate turns on a dime 

1479
01:30:16,140 --> 01:30:19,416
 The only thing that will change 

1480
01:30:19,540 --> 01:30:23,533
 Are the lights
that make it brighter 

1481
01:30:23,660 --> 01:30:26,618
 They replace the sun 

1482
01:30:26,740 --> 01:30:30,255
Watch out over there now.
Watch out. Pay attention.

1483
01:30:30,380 --> 01:30:33,975
 Out the door you get burned 

1484
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:37,331
 And there is no way back in 

1485
01:30:37,460 --> 01:30:40,452
 You got nothin'
Snake eyes 

1486
01:30:40,580 --> 01:30:44,334
 The house always wins 

1487
01:30:44,460 --> 01:30:48,169
 A drowning man does not die silently 

1488
01:30:48,300 --> 01:30:51,815
 You can feel the final warning 

1489
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:55,410
 And the black money follows 

1490
01:30:55,540 --> 01:30:59,089
 Through the veins of the shallow 

1491
01:30:59,220 --> 01:31:02,656
 Change the name
to protect the guilty 

1492
01:31:02,780 --> 01:31:08,138
 You'll never leave Sin City 

1493
01:31:08,260 --> 01:31:11,411
 Where you are king 

1494
01:31:14,780 --> 01:31:18,250
 In this room of shame 

1495
01:31:18,380 --> 01:31:21,577
 You could sink this town 

1496
01:31:21,700 --> 01:31:25,295
 And breathe another day 

1497
01:31:25,420 --> 01:31:28,890
 The mirror faces you 

1498
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:32,729
 You cannot look away 

1499
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:35,579
 Blood is on your hand 

1500
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:41,212
 The streets will be the same 

1501
01:31:41,340 --> 01:31:44,855
 Under your feet like quicksand 

1502
01:31:44,980 --> 01:31:46,777
 Touch the face 

1503
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:51,769
 Where a kiss of hope can last 

1504
01:31:51,900 --> 01:31:55,609
 A drowning man
does not die silently 

1505
01:31:55,740 --> 01:31:59,289
 You can feel the final warning 

1506
01:31:59,420 --> 01:32:02,969
 And the black money follows 

1507
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:06,570
 Through the veins of the shallow 

1508
01:32:06,700 --> 01:32:09,976
 Change the name
to protect the guilty 

1509
01:32:10,100 --> 01:32:15,652
 You'll never leave Sin City 

1510
01:32:15,780 --> 01:32:18,453
 Where you are king 

1511
01:32:19,860 --> 01:32:22,215
 Whoa-oh 

1512
01:32:22,340 --> 01:32:27,255
 Where you are king 

1513
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:29,450
 Oh, oh, oh 

1514
01:32:44,820 --> 01:32:48,529
 A drowning man
does not die silently 

1515
01:32:48,660 --> 01:32:52,209
 You can feel the final warning 

1516
01:32:52,340 --> 01:32:55,889
 And the black money follows 

1517
01:32:56,020 --> 01:32:59,490
 Through the veins of the shallow 

1518
01:32:59,620 --> 01:33:02,930
 Change the name
to protect the guilty 

1519
01:33:03,060 --> 01:33:06,894
 You'll never leave Sin City 

1520
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:10,456
 Just one kiss from the shadow 

1521
01:33:10,580 --> 01:33:14,016
 Could be the touch of an angel 

1522
01:33:14,140 --> 01:33:17,496
 Just one kiss
is all that you need 

1523
01:33:17,620 --> 01:33:21,329
 You'll never leave Sin City 

1524
01:33:21,460 --> 01:33:24,691
 You'll never leave Sin City 

1525
01:33:24,820 --> 01:33:32,329
 You'll never leave Sin City 

1526
01:33:32,460 --> 01:33:36,294
-  Where you are king 
-  Just one kiss 

1527
01:33:36,420 --> 01:33:38,775
 Oh, oh, oh 

1528
01:33:38,900 --> 01:33:43,576
-  Where you are king 
-  Just one kiss 

1529
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,975
 Oh, oh, oh 

1530
01:33:46,100 --> 01:33:50,093
-  Where you are king 
-  Just one kiss 

1531
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:53,337
 Oh oh-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh 

1532
01:33:53,460 --> 01:33:57,248
-  Where you are king 
-  Just one kiss 

1533
01:33:57,380 --> 01:34:00,895
 Oh oh-oh-oh
Oh oh-oh-oh 

1534
01:34:01,020 --> 01:34:03,215
 Oh oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh 

1535
01:34:03,340 --> 01:34:06,457
 Just one kiss
Oh, oh, oh, oh 

1536
01:34:06,580 --> 01:34:10,289
 Oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh 

1537
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:12,092
 Just one kiss
