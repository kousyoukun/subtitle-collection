00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:25,699
and welcome to a Powell Pay-Per-View
television event!

5
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:29,328
It's hard to believe,
but tonight's heavyweight fight...

6
00:00:29,453 --> 00:00:32,289
is the swan song for the grand
old Atlantic City Arena,

7
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:35,125
the final event to be held
in this storied hall...

8
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:37,962
before it is gutted
and completely renovated...

9
00:00:38,087 --> 00:00:42,591
as part of Gilbert Powell's
Millennium Hotel and Casino.

10
00:00:42,716 --> 00:00:46,971
I'm eager to go ringside
along with 14,000 fight fans...

11
00:00:47,096 --> 00:00:49,598
who have braved
Hurricane Jezebel to--

[Man] Cut! cut!

13
00:00:51,725 --> 00:00:54,019
Anthea, they want you to call it
a tropical storm, not a hurricane.

14
00:00:54,145 --> 00:00:56,021
But it is a hurricane.

15
00:00:56,147 --> 00:00:58,315
Yeah, well, it's also
a holiday weekend,

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,318
so will you please just call it
a tropical storm, please?

17
00:01:01,443 --> 00:01:03,571
I love this town.
They even spin the weather.

18
00:01:03,696 --> 00:01:06,574
All right, listen. We gotta go live
on this one, so don't screw it up.

19
00:01:06,699 --> 00:01:09,910
And, Al, I think that's Powell going
in there with Secretary Kirkland.

during the intro.

- Anyway, why can't I do this from inside?
- All right, we're rolling.

22
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,750
- Why do I have to stand out here like a--
- Five, four, three,

Well, the lucky ones are already
inside at the fight...

as the first taste
of Tropical Storm Jezebel...

lashes the boardwalk outside
the grand old Atlantic City Arena.

where any of this is my problem.

I made a promise, Jimmy.
I gave my word to someone.

she threatened him, took something,
got shot and ran away.

Get on your goddam radio
and shut down the arena!

Get that crowd outta the way!

Come on! Tell him to bring
that ambulance through

the main entrance into
the arena tunnel!

You're gonna be all right.
You are gonna be all right, Charles.

00:15:46,662 --> 00:15:48,372
You're going to the
hospital right now. You're

gonna be okay. You
have my word on that.

outta the tunnel! Move it, there!

He's gonna die, Rick.
This is my fault.

326
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,757
I should never have left my seat.
I opened up a sight line.

327
00:15:58,883 --> 00:16:02,386
I was off the deck. What the hell
was I doing? This is my fault!

328
00:16:02,511 --> 00:16:06,265
What the hell is the matter with you? Don't
talk shit like that where people can hear.

329
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,392
You don't understand.
I pulled rank on

330
00:16:08,434 --> 00:16:10,728
regular detail and took
command of security.

331
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:14,440
I told them the secretary would be better
protected with me running the operation,

332
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:19,069
because I know the area, the layout of
the arena and the local law enforcement.

333
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:22,823
I get assigned, I step out of position, the
secretary takes a bullet in the throat.

334
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:23,949
Why were you out of position?

335
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:26,243
I should never have left him.
I could be court-martialled!

336
00:16:26,327 --> 00:16:30,039
That is not gonna happen! We're not gonna
let that happen. Do you understand?

337
00:16:30,164 --> 00:16:32,666
You are not going to prison,
so you just forget about that!

338
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,252
All right, back up.
Why were you out of position?

339
00:16:35,377 --> 00:16:39,590
The girl-- the redhead--
I went over to check her out.

340
00:16:39,715 --> 00:16:42,259
She ran, and
I followed her up here.

341
00:16:42,384 --> 00:16:44,970
Don't say "redhead" and don't say
"girl." Say "suspicious character."

342
00:16:45,095 --> 00:16:47,097
You followed a suspicious character,
and when you got up here,

343
00:16:47,223 --> 00:16:49,350
you saw an assassin fire,
so you took him out, end of story.

344
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,353
Rick, leaving my post is dereliction
of duty. It's gross negligence.

345
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:55,773
You killed the assassin!
You saved the day!

346

You're a hero, Kevin. That's what
happened, and that's how we'll spin it.

347
00:16:58,776 --> 00:17:01,445
- It wasn't procedure.
- Screw procedure!

Look, who do you think
you're talking to?

349
00:17:04,406 --> 00:17:08,285
I'm not some beat cop that needs
you to plant a piece for him.

350
00:17:08,410 --> 00:17:10,871
Kevin, if there's one thing I know,
it's how to cover my ass.

351
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:12,998
I see this shit happen
every day.

is gonna change the rest of your life.

but don't bury yourself now!

They're gaming enforcement.

00:17:30,599 --> 00:17:33,102
They're gonna try and muscle us,
but we're not gonna let that happen.

358
00:17:33,227 --> 00:17:36,105
If we're first contact when the feds get
here, everybody writes from our report,

359
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,899
and your story holds up
because we say so.

360

all the media outta here till then.

the feds to get here?

This is an active investigation.

so that's an hour,

in the clear, okay?

- It isn't lying!

and you leave out the rest!

an officer-involved shooting.

374
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:20,524
Secretary Kirkland
was shot in the neck.

375
00:18:20,649 --> 00:18:22,776
Paramedics just wheeled him out,
and that's the perpetrator.

took him out during the shooting.

That's right.
Commander Kevin Dunne. I'm with D.O.D.

- Atlantic City, Major Crimes.

- I'll take it now.
- No, bullshit you will.

380
00:18:37,082 --> 00:18:38,793
This isn't my blood, all right?
It's the secretary's.

381
00:18:38,793 --> 00:18:39,960
I was sitting right
in front of him.

382
00:18:40,044 --> 00:18:41,754
I'm a homicide detective
and a material witness.

383
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:43,130
This is mine about
six different ways!

384
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:45,382
A.C. cops got no
business in the casino.

385
00:18:45,508 --> 00:18:47,676
This is strictly D.G.E.
and state police.

386
00:18:47,802 --> 00:18:51,555
We're not on the casino floor, Gordo!
And this arena ain't the Millennium yet!

387
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,308
It's Atlantic City, New Jersey,
and that belongs to me!

388
00:18:54,433 --> 00:18:57,770
I'm acting case agent until relieved
by appropriate federal authority!

389
00:18:57,895 --> 00:19:01,774
Now, you want to help, you go tell your men
to get all the media outta here right now!

390
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:04,568
Unless you want the 9:00 news
to give the secretary's wife and kids...

391
00:19:04,693 --> 00:19:06,570
a close-up look
at his internal organs.

392
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:10,115
Phil, Jim, make this whole
arena a crime scene. Shut it down.

393
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:13,077
Nobody goes in or out till
the main investigating party gets here.

394
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:15,287
You're the one who told them
to seal the doors?

395
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:19,124
You can't hold 14,000 people
in these goddam exit tunnels!

396
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,127
Yes, we did,
and yes, we can.

397
00:19:21,252 --> 00:19:23,546
Those are 14,000
eyewitnesses!

398
00:19:23,671 --> 00:19:26,048
- Excuse me--
- We can just take as long as it takes...

399
00:19:26,173 --> 00:19:28,968
to get 14,000 addresses
and 14,000 phone numbers...

400
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:32,012
and take 14,000 pictures,
now that I think about it.

outta here.

[Laughs]
You're home free, baby.

404
00:19:39,770 --> 00:19:41,730
All right.
The woman who ran away--

405
00:19:41,856 --> 00:19:44,024
You said, she, uh--
she took something. What was it?

406
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,652
- It was in a manila envelope about this big.
- What did she look like?

407
00:19:46,777 --> 00:19:49,655
Caucasian, late 20's,
dressed in white, blood everywhere.

408
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:51,991
She had a blonde wig,
dark hair underneath.

409
00:19:52,116 --> 00:19:54,493
All right. You stay here with
every uniform you can get.

410
00:19:54,618 --> 00:19:57,872
I'll run a top-to-bottom and find her.
You guys, come with me.

411
00:19:57,997 --> 00:20:01,208
[Man] Excuse me. Excuse me.
Commander Dunne, sir?

412
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,669
Could you give us the identity
of the assassin, please?

413
00:20:03,794 --> 00:20:06,172
- Sir, how does it feel to be a hero?
- Hey, you, get outta here.

414
00:20:06,297 --> 00:20:09,300
We told you never to talk to the people
here. No press in the arena.

415
00:20:09,425 --> 00:20:13,304
I said no press inside the arena, Lou.
Not in the arena!

416
00:20:13,429 --> 00:20:15,639
Hey, I could see why you want
these other assholes outta here,

417
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:17,516
but I didn't think
you were talking about me too!

418
00:20:17,641 --> 00:20:19,894
- You know what kind of break this is for me?
- You can't show this.

419
00:20:20,019 --> 00:20:22,021
Look at the mess on the floor.
The guy's got a family.

420
00:20:22,021 --> 00:20:23,314
Have a heart, for
Christ's sakes.

421
00:20:23,397 --> 00:20:25,941
All right. I won't shoot
the spaghetti, then.

422
00:20:26,066 --> 00:20:27,985
Come on. Whenever
they make statements,

423
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:30,738
they always have one pool reporter
asking all the questions.

424
00:20:30,863 --> 00:20:34,116
That's the way they do it.
Come on. Let me be the guy.

425
00:20:34,241 --> 00:20:36,368
- Have you got the playback for
the pay-per-view up there?

426
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:37,244
- Yeah, right up here.

427
00:20:37,328 --> 00:20:39,580
Look, you don't know what
this would mean to me, Rick.

428
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:43,209
You think I want to do this, this
pay-per-view shit for the rest of my life?

429
00:20:43,334 --> 00:20:45,211
Do you know how Rather
got his break?

430
00:20:45,336 --> 00:20:48,547
- The goddam Kennedy assassination!
- Ah, you make me sick, Lou.

431
00:20:48,672 --> 00:20:51,842
Hey, if you're gonna be on TV,
who better asking you the questions...

432
00:20:51,967 --> 00:20:54,303
than your old pal Lou, huh?

433
00:20:54,428 --> 00:20:57,056
Plus, I can have two grand cash
in an hour and a half.

434
00:20:57,181 --> 00:20:59,058
You are a disgusting
human being.

435
00:20:59,183 --> 00:21:01,727
Hey, five grand in an hour.

585
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,302
- Four!
- Hey, Mick.

586
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:57,972
- What do you want?
- Just a second. Give me 35.

587
00:29:58,097 --> 00:30:00,307
- I got a quick question.
- Take a hike.

588
00:30:00,432 --> 00:30:03,644
- Come on, man!
- I'm gonna get you later. Get outta here.

589
00:30:03,769 --> 00:30:07,648
I'm gettin' a lot of bets-- very large
bets against Lincoln, that is.

590
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,151
I'm just wondering
what the fuck is going on.

591
00:30:10,276 --> 00:30:13,028
- Would you please lower your voice?
- Okay, look, I'm sorry.

592
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:16,031
It's just everybody knows
Lincoln likes the action, right?

593
00:30:16,157 --> 00:30:19,451
I mean, what I'm saying is Lincoln likes to
gamble, right? It's not exactly a secret.

594
00:30:19,577 --> 00:30:22,455
Never on boxing. I've been through
all this shit with the commission.

595
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,665
- I do not have to explain it to you.
- I know about the commission.

596
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,668
- Never on boxing.
- You're right. Yeah, that's right, okay?

597
00:30:27,793 --> 00:30:30,004
He's in pretty heavy at some
of the casinos, isn't he?

598
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:33,007
And some people are saying that maybe he's
looking to clean up the books a little.

599
00:30:33,132 --> 00:30:35,301
Maybe Lincoln's decided
tonight's not his night.

600
00:30:35,426 --> 00:30:38,304
You actually come to tell him there's
a lot of action against him?

601
00:30:38,429 --> 00:30:40,181
Then you have the nerve
to accuse him of what?

602
00:30:40,222 --> 00:30:41,348
You know what I'm saying.

603
00:30:41,432 --> 00:30:43,517
I've never been this
offended in my life.

604
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:46,854
I want you to tell Lincoln what you
just said to me. Come on. Hey, Lincoln?

605
00:30:46,979 --> 00:30:50,107
Jimmy's got something really
interesting to tell you. Listen to this.

606
00:30:50,232 --> 00:30:53,277
- Go on, tell him.
- Forget it. Forget everything I said.

607
00:30:53,402 --> 00:30:56,280
- Come on. Listen.
- Knock him dead, champ.

608
00:30:56,405 --> 00:30:58,365
Jimmy George,
wait up a second.

609
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:00,326
Hey, come on, Rick. I got
people waiting for me.

610
00:31:00,367 --> 00:31:01,076
Hey. Hey. Hey!

611
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,036
That's Tyler!

612
00:31:02,036 --> 00:31:05,539
Hey, what are you looking at?
Go buy a ticket.

613
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:08,125
You are never
gonna get away with this.

614
00:31:08,250 --> 00:31:10,336
- Get out of my face, Mickey.
- Look at me!

615
00:31:10,461 --> 00:31:12,671
- No. No, no, no, no, no!
- Look at yourself!

616
00:31:12,797 --> 00:31:15,966
Bleed, Mickey! Bleed!
You taught me that.

617
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:18,010
[Grunting]
Remember?

618
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:20,679
No, no. No way, man.
You got yourself into this.

619
00:31:20,805 --> 00:31:23,349
You get caught,
you lose my phone number.

620
00:31:23,474 --> 00:31:25,518
I told you,
you can't live like you do.

621
00:31:25,643 --> 00:31:28,521
You make yourself vulnerable.
Everybody wants a piece of you.

622
00:31:28,646 --> 00:31:32,274
Well, look at this, man.
They got all of you now.

623
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:33,234
[Grunts]

624
00:31:33,317 --> 00:31:36,779
That's beautiful. That is--
That's terrif-- That's great.

625
00:31:36,904 --> 00:31:39,907
- That's great. Jesus Christ!
- Mickey?

626
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:42,701
- Yeah? Cyrus, here.
- Come on, Mickey. I got bills to pay.

627
00:31:42,827 --> 00:31:46,288
- Take that and get lost.
- Best of the best, right, Mr Tyler?

628
00:31:46,413 --> 00:31:50,376
- Come on, get outta here. Move along.
- Tyler! Tyler! Tyler!

Tyler!
[Grunting 1

00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:54,713
Tyler! Ty--

631
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:57,716
- Words mean something to somebody else--
-All right, don't move.

632
00:31:57,842 --> 00:32:01,262
- I'll be right back. Cyrus! Cyrus!
- Yo, yo.

“Cyrus!
_Y°!

634
00:32:05,057 --> 00:32:08,018
How much were you
into the casinos for?

635
00:32:09,645 --> 00:32:11,522
Enough.

636
00:32:11,647 --> 00:32:14,483
The people that set this up
said if I dropped this one,

637
00:32:14,608 --> 00:32:16,819
they'd square
everything I owed.

638
00:32:16,944 --> 00:32:21,031
Plus, if I lose to an underdog,
it would set me up for a rematch,

639
00:32:21,157 --> 00:32:23,492
and the rematch
is where the real money is.

640
00:32:23,617 --> 00:32:26,328
They didn't say what round
they wanted it in.

641
00:32:26,454 --> 00:32:30,207
They were gonna let me know during the
fight. There was a guy in the front row.

642
00:32:30,332 --> 00:32:34,295
They told me what he was gonna say, and
he was gonna be the signal to go down.

643
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:36,630
I ain't never
gonna forget those words:

644
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:38,966
"Here comes the pain."

645
00:32:42,511 --> 00:32:45,681
It was all I could do to keep from
taking him out. Just one punch.

646
00:32:45,806 --> 00:32:48,476
Shove that radio right through
the side of his head.

647
00:32:48,601 --> 00:32:50,811
- Radio?
- Yeah.

648
00:32:50,936 --> 00:32:53,898
He had one of those things
in his ear.

649
00:32:54,023 --> 00:32:56,984
Anyway, the fight started.

650
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:59,111
Come on, man.
Come on, old man.

651
00:32:59,236 --> 00:33:01,405
Let's see
what you got, old man.

652
00:33:01,530 --> 00:33:03,949
I couldn't get that sack of shit
to take a decent swing at me.

653
00:33:03,991 --> 00:33:04,950
Is that all you got?

654
00:33:05,034 --> 00:33:08,621
He wouldn't stop talking, like he
was gonna bullshit me to death.

655
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:11,373
Gotta do better than that.
Come on, baby! Ohhh!

656
00:33:11,499 --> 00:33:14,335
Come on, now!
You're too slow, old man. Come on!

657
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:17,171
What you gonna do to me, huh?
[Grunting]

658
00:33:21,091 --> 00:33:24,178
[Laughs]
That's what I'm talking about.

<i>Whoo-hoo-hoo!
Yeah!</i>

Come on, baby! Come on!
Come on! Let's see what you got!

00:33:31,477 --> 00:33:34,146
Let me see what you got, old man.
Come on, bring it to me.

Yeah, I'm right here.
I'm right here.

665
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,375
What are you trying to do
with that stuff you got?

666
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:55,835
Come on. You're too slow!

667
00:33:55,918 --> 00:33:58,796
I was just trying
to shut him up.

668
00:33:58,921 --> 00:34:01,132
I barely even tapped him,

669
00:34:01,257 --> 00:34:03,884
and I almost won the fight.

[Crowd Booing]

683
00:34:48,596 --> 00:34:51,765
And he did head-butt me.
I wasn't lying about that.

684
00:34:51,891 --> 00:34:55,019
Everything went wrong. It was like
he was trying to screw up the deal.

00:34:55,144 --> 00:34:57,021
- I'll stop the fight.
- No!

686
00:34:57,146 --> 00:34:59,356
- Right after that, I got the signal.
- Are you all right?

687
00:34:59,482 --> 00:35:01,692
- Are you sure?
- It was quicker than I thought.

688
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:04,612
- Maybe they were getting nervous.
- Let's get it on.

689
00:35:04,737 --> 00:35:09,283
Here comes the pain, baby!
Here comes the pain!

690
00:35:09,408 --> 00:35:13,621
- Here comes the pain!
- I showed you what it's about!

691
00:35:13,746 --> 00:35:16,791
I wasn't supposed to go down right away.
They were very clear about that.

692
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,626
I had to take a punch,
fall back into the

693
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:20,544
corner, let him charge
in and knock me out...

694
00:35:20,628 --> 00:35:23,130
because they wanted everybody
up on their feet, distracted,

695
00:35:23,255 --> 00:35:26,133
giving him a clear shot
right through the count.

696
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:29,595
But that punkass son of a bitch
didn't sweep through the punch,

697
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:33,265
and I was so far into the act
in my own head, you know,

698
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:36,936
by the time I realized he didn't
connect, I was already in the corner.

- You hear that storm out there?

- No, no, no. Who's she?

710
00:36:20,354 --> 00:36:23,399
She's the one who came to me in the first
place, told me I was supposed to go down.

711
00:36:23,524 --> 00:36:26,402
- I never met anybody else but her.
- Did you get a name?

712

Yeah, name, address, serial
number, 8 by 10 colour picture.

You wanna look at that too?

714
00:36:30,531 --> 00:36:33,325
Do you remember anything
unusual about her?

715
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:35,661
- Her hair, maybe.
- What about it?

716
00:36:35,786 --> 00:36:40,124
It was bright red,
like it was on fire.

A Palestinian who's lived in the
United States for the last six years.

718
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:47,882
He's believed to be linked
to a series of threatening letters...

719
00:36:48,007 --> 00:36:51,010
written to various defence secretaries
expressing outrage...

720
00:36:51,135 --> 00:36:54,346
over the sale of missile systems
and other weaponry to Israel.

721
00:36:54,472 --> 00:36:58,517
A handwritten note
was found on Rabat's body.

722
00:36:58,642 --> 00:37:00,728
Would you hold that
up too, please?

723
00:37:00,853 --> 00:37:03,522
Apparently he intended it
to be found after the shooting.

724
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:05,608
Uh, Commander, what's
in the note, sir?

725
00:37:05,733 --> 00:37:08,611
I can't disclose that until
it's been studied by investigators.

726
00:37:08,736 --> 00:37:12,114
Commander, could you give us the
condition of the secretary, please?

727
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:14,950
He was taken
to Atlantic City Medical Center,

728
00:37:15,075 --> 00:37:17,953
but, uh, I have no other
information at this time.

729
00:37:18,078 --> 00:37:20,915
That's all I can say until the F.B.l.
joins the investigation.

00:37:27,546 --> 00:37:30,633
There's a dozen service doors from here
to there. We couldn't watch all of them.

734
00:37:30,758 --> 00:37:32,802
Well, double the men you
have at the casino exits.

735
00:37:32,843 --> 00:37:33,844
I gotta talk to you.

736
00:37:33,928 --> 00:37:36,931
- What is it?
- Let's go somewhere private.

737
00:37:37,056 --> 00:37:40,059
Just because a guy has something plugged
into his ear doesn't mean--

738
00:37:40,184 --> 00:37:42,478
I asked.
Tyler says it was a radio.

739
00:37:42,603 --> 00:37:47,483
Okay, we'll check it out. But a compulsive
gambler who admits he took a dive...

740
00:37:47,608 --> 00:37:49,985
might not turn out
to be the best witness in the world.

741
00:37:50,110 --> 00:37:51,737
It's not just him. I'm
betting the redhead is

742
00:37:51,779 --> 00:37:53,405
the person who told Tyler
to throw the fight.

743
00:37:53,489 --> 00:37:57,535
She's one, shooter's two, Tyler's three,
the drunk who shouted the signal's four,

744
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:00,704
and whoever was on the other end
of that radio is five.

745
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:04,166
Five people
make a conspiracy, right?

746
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:07,211
Yeah, yeah. Look, anything's possible,
but I gotta tell you...

747
00:38:07,336 --> 00:38:10,131
we got a file an inch thick
on this guy Rabat.

748
00:38:10,256 --> 00:38:14,135
He's a well-known nutcase. It was clear
he was ready to die for his cause.

749
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:16,554
That's a suicide note.

750
00:38:16,679 --> 00:38:19,765
You know, "I fly into the arms
of Allah," shit like that.

751
00:38:19,890 --> 00:38:22,643
He was all worked up
about our missile sales to Israel,

752
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:26,647
and it's conceivable that he found out
about the Norfolk test.

753
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:30,317
Norfolk test?
What's that?

754
00:38:30,442 --> 00:38:36,115
Kevin, I know it's classified, but I am the
investigating officer in a murder now.

755
00:38:39,452 --> 00:38:43,330
All right. But what are you
chasing this for?

756
00:38:43,456 --> 00:38:46,667
You don't get out of bed unless
there's an angle in it for you.

757
00:38:46,792 --> 00:38:50,379
Guys get elected president just for being
in the right place at the right time.

758
00:38:50,504 --> 00:38:52,381
I only want to be mayor.

759
00:38:54,717 --> 00:38:59,054
Look, part of what
I'm going to tell you,

760
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:02,308
it could bury me.

761
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:04,602
I hope you can keep this
between us.

762
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:08,355
Kevin, you're talking
to your best friend.

763
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:11,775
<i>And loyalty's my only vice.
So what's the problem?</i>

764
00:39:11,901 --> 00:39:15,446
The problem is that
I was in too good a mood.

765
00:39:18,073 --> 00:39:21,285
That trip to Norfolk
was for a weapons test...

766
00:39:21,410 --> 00:39:24,705
for the AirGuard, Powell's
new antimissile defence system.

767
00:39:24,830 --> 00:39:27,750
It's light years ahead of the
Sea Sparrows our ships have now.

768
00:39:27,875 --> 00:39:32,880
If we had this in the Gulf
when the Renville--

769
00:39:33,005 --> 00:39:36,801
After the Renville incident the old man
picked me to sell it to congress.

770
00:39:36,926 --> 00:39:40,763
Everybody at D.O.D. wanted it to work,
and it did. The test went beautifully.

771
00:39:40,888 --> 00:39:44,975
By the time we got to the fight
tonight, we were all high as kites.

772
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:49,563
I let the excitement get to me.
I lost my edge.

773
00:39:49,688 --> 00:39:53,192
- [Dunne] Can I see your ticket, please?
- My what?

774
00:39:53,317 --> 00:39:56,320
Your ticket, ma'am.
I need to see your ticket for this seat.

775
00:39:56,445 --> 00:40:00,241
Oh, my ticket. Um, yeah, sure.
I think I have it here.

Hey!

779
00:40:29,645 --> 00:40:31,856
[Dunne] Hold on a minute.
I was talking to you back there.

780
00:40:31,981 --> 00:40:34,024
Where do you think
you're going?

781
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:36,360
I'm going to the ladies' room.
Is that okay with you?

782
00:40:36,485 --> 00:40:39,864
In the middle of the first round?
You're not much of a fight fan, I guess.

783
00:40:39,989 --> 00:40:42,616
Look, uh, Sarge,
I don't know who you are,

784
00:40:42,741 --> 00:40:45,202
but you have no right
to hassle me like this.

785
00:40:45,327 --> 00:40:49,582
I get paid to hassle people. Show me your
ticket, or I'll have you escorted out.

786
00:40:49,707 --> 00:40:53,169
Okay, okay. I don't have a ticket.
I mean, I have a ticket,

787
00:40:53,294 --> 00:40:56,297
but it's way up there
in the nosebleed seats...

788
00:40:56,422 --> 00:40:59,467
and I-l couldn't
see a thing, so--

789
00:40:59,592 --> 00:41:03,471
Listen, I do this all the time.
They always let me get away with it.

790
00:41:03,596 --> 00:41:06,640
- Come on. It's no big deal.
- It is tonight.

791
00:41:06,765 --> 00:41:10,644
- What's so special about tonight?
- Very important man in the crowd.

792
00:41:10,769 --> 00:41:16,317
Oh. And you're, uh,
what, his bodyguard?

793
00:41:16,442 --> 00:41:20,154
That must be
a very exciting job.

794
00:41:20,279 --> 00:41:24,116
- Yeah, it's got its moments.
- [Silenced Gunshots]

795
00:41:34,794 --> 00:41:38,297
I was three feet away
from a known terrorist,

796
00:41:38,422 --> 00:41:43,803
and I had my eyes buried
in some broad's tits.

797
00:41:43,928 --> 00:41:46,722
Well, Kevin, this might not make you
feel better, but don't you see?

798
00:41:46,847 --> 00:41:49,683
That's what she was there for.
That was the plan.

799
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:52,144
To give you a boner.
And you got one.

800
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:56,440
- Congratulations. You're human.
- Come on, Rick.

801
00:41:56,565 --> 00:41:59,985
Look on the bright side. I like you
better. Golden boy screwed up.

802
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:04,657
Wait a minute. We need to be very,
very careful with this.

803
00:42:04,782 --> 00:42:08,536
We go out there and yell conspiracy,
it's like waving a lunatic flag.

804
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:12,164
We gotta get our hands on the redhead
or the guy that shouted the signal.

805
00:42:12,289 --> 00:42:14,166
If they're still
in the building.

806

And the woman who was
talking to the secretary.

807
00:42:16,335 --> 00:42:18,546
I'll stay after her,
and you find the other two.

808
00:42:18,671 --> 00:42:20,506
No, no. This is wrong.
We're never gonna

find anything just walking
around the arena.

810
00:42:22,675 --> 00:42:25,261
What if they've gone into the casino?
I'm going up to surveillance.

811
00:42:25,386 --> 00:42:27,847
They've got cameras all over the place.
Just bitchin' technology.

812
00:42:27,972 --> 00:42:31,851
All right, you do that while I check with
security, see if they found anything.

Well, I finally understand why you didn't
want me to worry about your shooter.

816
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:22,526
One less terrorist
in the world.

817
00:43:22,651 --> 00:43:25,988
At least he did something
productive on his way out.

818
00:43:26,113 --> 00:43:28,365
Did he know he was
on a suicide mission?

819
00:43:30,284 --> 00:43:32,578
He does now.

820
00:43:32,703 --> 00:43:36,123
With all due respect, sir, we should
have been out of here 11 minutes ago.

Things have changed.

We need to make
an adjustment.

823

A local cop
made both of you.

- What?
- Made us? How?

825

the building for you right now.

Take him out?</i>

- That's not an option.
- It's the only option.

828
00:44:00,815 --> 00:44:04,109
Negative.
Not with this guy.

829

- Let's move out.
- Yes, sir.

don't you, sir?

- Yes, but I don't like it.
- Why not?

832
00:44:13,786 --> 00:44:15,830

deserves better.

00:58:35,773 --> 00:58:36,982
Are you here on
official business?

1028
00:58:37,066 --> 00:58:40,027
Not for a couple of hours.
I'm just another fight fan.

1029
00:58:40,152 --> 00:58:44,115
[Julia] I couldn't get near him when they
first came in. Powell was all over him.

1030
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,700
The South Jersey worker
we are interested in tonight...

1031
00:58:46,826 --> 00:58:48,744
is the Atlantic City
Executioner.

1032
00:58:48,869 --> 00:58:51,914
<i>[Julia] So I decided
to wait until the fight started.</i>

1033
00:58:52,039 --> 00:58:56,919
And I had no idea where they were sitting,
so I went up top to get a better view.

1034
00:59:09,014 --> 00:59:11,475
[Cheering, Shouting]

1035
00:59:49,388 --> 00:59:52,224
[Rick] All right.
Hold it, hold it. Stop right there.

1036
00:59:52,349 --> 00:59:54,852
This is Dunne
you're talking about.

1037
00:59:54,977 --> 00:59:58,647
- Naval uniform? Commander Kevin Dunne?
-Right.

1038
00:59:58,772 --> 01:00:01,400
- Talking with Rabat before he shoots Kirkland?
- Yeah.

1039
01:00:01,525 --> 01:00:03,027
I recognized him, and I'd
just seen him come in.

1040
01:00:03,027 --> 01:00:03,903
No, then you saw wrong.

1041
01:00:03,986 --> 01:00:06,781
It wasn't Dunne.
He could not be a part of it.

1042
01:00:06,906 --> 01:00:10,451
Will you just listen
to the rest?

1043
01:00:37,269 --> 01:00:40,189
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- [Man] That seafs taken.

1044
01:00:40,314 --> 01:00:42,691
Oh, but you
can sit here.

1045
01:00:42,817 --> 01:00:45,194
- Well, I'll just need one minute.
- Me too.

1046
01:00:45,319 --> 01:00:48,906
[Laughs]
It's in the pocket.

1047
01:00:49,031 --> 01:00:51,075
- Excuse me. Did you say something?
- It's in the pocket.

1048
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:53,911
- Possible make.
- Pocket?

1049
01:00:54,036 --> 01:00:57,248
<i>- So you've been writing to me.
- Just look in the envelope, Mr Secretary.</i>

1050
01:00:57,373 --> 01:01:00,334
- What is it?
- It's the satellite infra-reds from yesterday's tests.

1051
01:01:00,459 --> 01:01:02,253
They gave me those. They
showed convergent impact.

1052
01:01:02,294 --> 01:01:03,546
They gave you doctored copies.

1053
01:01:03,629 --> 01:01:05,005
These are the originals from
the proving ground computers.

1054
01:01:05,047 --> 01:01:05,714
Make is good. Stand by.

1055
01:01:05,798 --> 01:01:08,050
- Please, just look for yourself.
- [Paper Rustling]

1056
01:01:08,175 --> 01:01:10,719
- Okay.
- [Dunne] She has the infra-reds.

1057
01:01:10,845 --> 01:01:13,055
I need you to look at the heat flashes
here at the moment of impact.

1058
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:14,682
- If the AirGuard had made full
intercept like it's supposed to,

1059
01:01:14,682 --> 01:01:15,141
- Start the count.

1060
01:01:15,224 --> 01:01:17,643
- Copy. - there would be one
dot, but there's two every time.

1061
01:01:17,768 --> 01:01:20,646
The target blows up, but the AirGuard
never gets within ten metres of it.

1062
01:01:20,771 --> 01:01:22,857
- Then why would the target blow up?
- Bring on the pain, baby!

1063
01:01:22,982 --> 01:01:25,901
Because they rigged it, Mr Secretary.
They put on a fireworks display for you.

1064
01:01:26,026 --> 01:01:29,071
The AirGuard doesn't work, and the
company knows the system doesn't work,

1065
01:01:29,196 --> 01:01:31,449
but they're pushing it
through anyway.

1066
01:01:31,574 --> 01:01:33,117
I know what they're
thinking-- we get it

1067
01:01:33,159 --> 01:01:34,994
approved now, say we're
sorry and fix it later.

1068
01:01:35,077 --> 01:01:37,455
But I am telling you,
you're the one that's gonna be sorry.

1069
01:01:37,580 --> 01:01:39,623
- Jesus Christ! Bert Powell's out of his mind.
- [Cel Phone Ringing]

1070
01:01:39,748 --> 01:01:42,376
If you deploy that weapons system
and a war breaks out--

1071
01:01:42,501 --> 01:01:44,462
- All right. I get the picture.
- Hello? Who?

1072
01:01:44,587 --> 01:01:46,797
Don't make plans for
the next six months, young lady.

1073
01:01:46,922 --> 01:01:49,550
You're going to be sending
some people to jail. [Grunts]

[People Screaming]

1077
01:02:09,278 --> 01:02:12,573
That's not what happened.
That's not what happened.

1078
01:02:12,698 --> 01:02:15,576
I'm sorry. I wish I didn't know
any of this either.

1079
01:02:15,701 --> 01:02:19,121
Who the hell do you
think you are, lady?

1080
01:02:19,246 --> 01:02:22,833
Sticking your nose in where it doesn't
belong. You're a number cruncher.

1081
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:26,045
Just crunch
the goddam numbers!

1082
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:28,547
Uh, I was doing my job.

1083
01:02:28,672 --> 01:02:31,634
I mean, we were creating a defence system
that was supposed to save people's lives.

1084
01:02:31,759 --> 01:02:35,346
They're building the factory
in a disadvantaged part of the state.

1085
01:02:35,471 --> 01:02:38,182
- This was a good thing to do.
- "This was a good thing to do."

1086
01:02:38,307 --> 01:02:41,519
Jesus, somebody hands you a line,
you just swallow it whole, don't you?

1087
01:02:41,644 --> 01:02:43,646
Just a little
Goody Two-shoes.

1088
01:02:43,771 --> 01:02:45,689
Yeah, I believed in what we
were doing, and they corrupted it.

1089
01:02:45,815 --> 01:02:47,817
So somebody had to speak up.
I mean, it's important.

1090
01:02:47,942 --> 01:02:51,904
Does it feel important now? Did it
feel important when the bullet hit?

1091
01:02:52,029 --> 01:02:53,906
I had no choice.

1092
01:02:54,031 --> 01:02:56,951
I can't live with the blood
of innocent soldiers on me, okay?

1093
01:02:57,076 --> 01:02:59,370
- Whose side are you on?
- My side.

1094
01:02:59,495 --> 01:03:02,456
That E-mail. You let 'em know
you were coming.

1095
01:03:02,581 --> 01:03:06,043
- They just sat back and waited for you to show your face.
- No, I was careful.

1096
01:03:06,168 --> 01:03:09,213
I waited till Powell left.
I didn't sit down till it was clear.

1097
01:03:09,338 --> 01:03:12,633
No, you sat down exactly
when they wanted you to.

1098
01:03:12,758 --> 01:03:14,969
They opened the door,
and you walked on through right on cue.

1099
01:03:15,094 --> 01:03:18,848
They didn't miss him with
that second shot. They missed you.

1100
01:03:23,185 --> 01:03:27,898
I thought I'd get fired,
not... killed.

[Sniffles]
What do we do now?

1102
01:03:31,819 --> 01:03:34,738
Well, are you a cop
or aren't you?

1103
01:03:34,864 --> 01:03:39,201
I can't get past the men at the doors
by myself, but with you I'd be fine.

1104
01:03:39,326 --> 01:03:41,745
You get me outside, you don't have to
think about me again.

1105

- I can take care of myself.
- You've done a hell of a job so far.

Look, I'm sorry if I--

1107

- Who gives a shit if you're sorry?
- What are you mad at me for?

1108
01:03:52,548 --> 01:03:55,217
Because I didn't have
to know!

1109
01:03:55,342 --> 01:03:57,720
You decided to have
this problem, not me!

1110

My world would've gone on turning
just fine, but now either way I look,

1111
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:04,101
I have to do something
I don't want to do.

<i>I'm 26.</i>

1118

Do you have a,
a family around here?

1119
01:04:37,384 --> 01:04:39,386
My mother in New York.

1120

Do you have a husband?

1121
01:04:42,389 --> 01:04:44,266
- No.
- Boyfriend?

1122
01:04:44,391 --> 01:04:47,144
Why are you asking me
all this?

1123
01:04:47,269 --> 01:04:50,481
Kevin. Kevin Dunne.

1124
01:04:50,606 --> 01:04:53,609
You're positive he's the one you saw
with Rabat before the shots were fired?

1125
01:04:53,734 --> 01:04:55,820
Let me tell you a little
something about Kevin Dunne.

1126
01:04:55,820 --> 01:04:56,529
You know him.

1127
01:04:56,612 --> 01:04:59,657
He is one of the most
honourable dudes on the planet!

1128
01:04:59,698 --> 01:05:01,492
You know him. You know him.

1129
01:05:01,575 --> 01:05:04,829
Yeah, I know him. And you could
be wrong. Yeah, you could.

1130
01:05:04,954 --> 01:05:07,456
There were people
rushing in front of you,

1131
01:05:07,581 --> 01:05:09,834
and you were nervous,
and you were scared.

1132
01:05:09,959 --> 01:05:12,128
- You could be wrong. Isn't it possible?
- Yes. Yes.

1133
01:05:12,253 --> 01:05:12,962
Isn't it so?

1134
01:05:12,962 --> 01:05:15,756
Yeah, now that I think about
it, I think I could be wrong.

1135
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:18,717
Um, you remember
I told you that my glasses,

1136
01:05:18,843 --> 01:05:21,262
they had fallen off,
and I couldn't quite focus.

1137
01:05:21,387 --> 01:05:22,555
I don't think it was him.

1138
01:05:22,555 --> 01:05:25,599
Shit. Your glasses didn't fall
off till after the gunshots--

1139
01:05:26,809 --> 01:05:28,686
Nah, shit!

1140
01:05:28,811 --> 01:05:32,022
What happened
with the girl?

1141
01:05:32,148 --> 01:05:36,360
A cop shoved her out of the way,
and he's got her now somewhere.

01:05:36,485 --> 01:05:40,239
The cop?
You mean your cop?

Yes.

1144
01:05:43,159 --> 01:05:45,828
But it's all good, right,
because you said he's controllable?

1145
01:05:45,953 --> 01:05:47,872
Absolutely.

1146
01:05:47,997 --> 01:05:51,375
He's only chasing this down because
he thinks it's a career opportunity.

1147
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:55,546
Chasing it down, what?
You said he'd sit back.

1148
01:05:55,671 --> 01:05:58,966
This doesn't sound
like he's sitting back.

1149
01:05:59,091 --> 01:06:00,885
It sounds like he's
conducting an active

1150
01:06:00,926 --> 01:06:02,970
investigation, a very
dangerous investigation.

Five minutes from now, I gotta be on TV.

Now, what is it, yes or no? We got
a goddam Columbo runnin' around loose?

No operation goes exactly as planned.
You don't panic.

01:06:16,484 --> 01:06:19,487
Stay calm
and tie up loose ends.

What do you think I've been doing
for the last hour?

1157
01:06:22,072 --> 01:06:27,495
Jesus Christ!
This is not the plan I invested in!

1158
01:06:27,620 --> 01:06:30,372
In the plan I bought,
that prairie populist...

1159
01:06:30,498 --> 01:06:34,418
who was criminally dismantling
the entire armed forces, goes down!

1160
01:06:34,543 --> 01:06:38,506
The disloyal employee,
she goes down with him.

1161
01:06:38,631 --> 01:06:41,926
The fanatical terrorist,
he takes the rap.

1162
01:06:42,051 --> 01:06:44,720
The AirGuard missile
contract is approved,

1163
01:06:44,845 --> 01:06:49,266
and I, I get enough money to finish
the goddam Millennium!

1164
01:06:49,391 --> 01:06:52,019
It was a good plan!

1165
01:06:52,144 --> 01:06:55,272
No humiliation,
no scandal, no prison!

1166
01:06:55,397 --> 01:06:57,858
We're still contained.

1167
01:07:02,238 --> 01:07:05,741
Once the girl is gone,
it's only me and two men I trust.

Do we have another
acceptable loss?

1171
01:07:18,337 --> 01:07:20,589
I'm not on that list,
