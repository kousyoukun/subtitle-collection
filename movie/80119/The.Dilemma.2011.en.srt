1
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,152
On bruco?koj year
he is completely mad.

2
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,392
I have a question, how
need to

3
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,319
really getting to know
anyone?

4
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:57,679
I believe that someone
consistently meets

5
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:58,910
because people change
over time.

6
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,352
But, if with some
go through hell

7
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,755
Then you realize
how they relate

8
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,758
which is very important.

9
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,195
Come on.

10
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:11,397
I believe that someone
can meet the

11
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,631
the first ten
seconds.

12
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,912
I'm in Geneva
fell in love immediately.

13
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,636
It's true.

14
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,913
I do not know if I ever
just meet someone.

15
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,956
What it means.

16
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,989
Do you know someone and you think
that's good.

17
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:30,679
And find out for something
which did not exist.

18
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,110
It happens every day.

19
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,396
Watch the show "20-20".
Always the same story.

20
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:39,959
Couple, happy, guy buys
bow and arrow shaft and

21
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,030
practicing in the garage.

22
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,193
Bring me some lemonade.
God, I

23
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,509
knowing that you will enter
at the moment.

24
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,676
Please, go ahead.

25
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,953
Forgive him, was
accidents and

26
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:53,198
6 months occurs
accidents.

27
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,356
No. - Yes.

28
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,233
I constantly hear about
families have

29
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,834
other families.

30
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:04,072
Father works, who knows what
and go to Connecticut.

31
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,039
But it did not go there
business already in

32
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,110
Harlem because it has
family for which no

33
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,549
heard.

34
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,395
While watching the game
and eating snacks, enjoy.

35
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,153
You might think that
know someone

36
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,072
and then it turns out that
do not know everything about someone.

37
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,355
Have not yet responded
the question. - Am.

38
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,239
You go around.
This often do.

39
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,559
I think all of you
special.

40
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,076
This is our chance,
hug him.

41
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,516
I do not want.

42
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,390
Ever since he watched the death of
in the eye, became a

43
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,755
sensitive guy who loves
to embrace.

44
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,079
You know I do not like to
touching people

45
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,270
you do not know
well.

46
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,955
Even those
I know.

47
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,470
Do you want this?
- Of course.

48
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,434
Set database, this has
button.

49
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:20,149
If you embrace otvori?e?
it will be a happy and

50
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,118
will begin with a check.

51
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,194
I'm not asking you to go to
Airport Motel

52
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,038
and Japan's fool,
seek to embrace

53
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,471
general manager
General Motors.

54
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,956
Embrace him to feel
warm and happy.

55
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,911
It is nice that you came.
Thanks.

56
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,078
This reminds me of
first dojo.

57
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:58,192
Remember when
car designed for fun.

58
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,753
They had a nice sound,
real power

59
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,200
and feel you are dangerous
because you are behind the wheel.

60
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,113
Ronnie Valentine from
BMW engine design.

61
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,998
Thomas Fern.
- We helped you

62
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,317
with several models VCU
a few years ago.

63
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,317
It was my partner,
Nick Brennan.

64
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,033
Congratulations. Brilliant years.

65
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,915
Of course.

66
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:33,316
Your soul is too
important to be taken.

67
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,635
You have great days before the
them.

68
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,838
We are not committed to anyone,
we can buy

69
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,118
your team and let's see
whether it suits you.

70
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,355
I like that.

71
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:45,234
Find someone
books and come in

72
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,675
Detroit to visit you.

73
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:58,876
La?Ijivce, incredible
si. I embrace it like a lunatic.

74
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,638
Why? - Because it is our
direct competition.

75
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,638
Why would he do it?
- Because he had an encounter with death.

76
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,478
No, I invented it.
- What are you doing?

77
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,995
We got a meeting.

78
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,437
The more you do not listen,
has placed me.

79
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:20,638
Geneva, you know it, too
is honest, that I

80
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:26,154
He said what will be
going to happen sweating,

81
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:27,833
shortness of breath,
unconscious.

82
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,473
This is unnecessary.

83
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,110
Nick, we got a meeting.

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,076
I will not lie, sometimes
I love your guy.

85
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,313
Do not let me ever.

86
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,877
L?li are in a class.
- To play.

87
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,999
Less is more, I play
inside.

88
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,555
Now? - Yes.

89
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,869
You can not trust
man who plays.

90
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:02,794
Great people in history
did not play.

91
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,635
Lincoln did not play,
Churchill was not wiping the floor.

92
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,833
Martin Luther King
had a dream, but did not play.

93
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,190
Come on. - I'm serious.

94
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:15,470
Sit down immediately.

95
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,599
You think they are great,
and they play.

96
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:20,199
I think they are the best.

97
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,558
These are my heroes.

98
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,513
Get up.
- Ronnie called you

99
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,349
pair of heroes, and rejects
to play with me.

100
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,113
Stop.

101
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,909
I'm your hero.

102
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,312
Every child wants to
playing with her hero.

103
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:46,319
Let's do it.

104
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:05,273
That's right, baby.

105
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,469
It happened.

106
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,037
I will never forget
it.

107
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:31,636
Now that's a problem.
- I think so.

108
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:43,196
Sorry, I have this.
Let me show you.

109
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,635
Go ahead.

110
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,115
Come on, you're stuck
with me.

111
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,793
When you set
question.

112
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:01,315
See her face.

113
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,873
You'll never find
as a good girl

114
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,388
what it is, let us
realistic.

115
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,632
Nick and I will not have
new friends.

116
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,599
Leaving you with all my
friends.

117
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:20,796
I was left with nothing.
I like it.

118
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,792
Others did not like,
a friend to me.

119
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:29,760
Believe me, ask her or
You will lose it.

120
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,473
Special Delivery,
What about that at the entrance.

121
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,797
Missed you.
- And you are to me.

122
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,755
What is it? - Nothing.

123
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,949
It's time to warm up.

124
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,352
What happens when you cook
go to work?

125
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,868
Do not play me.

126
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,993
I won.

127
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,075
Now you can play?
This is ridiculous.

128
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,877
This is done when the
almost.

129
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:17,231
I'm sorry. - It is not, in fact
the problem is.

130
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:20,791
Spiritual you and me
like,

131
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:24,232
to try
Contact your entire body.

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,592
You can not answer
People larger than themselves.

133
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,434
Yes, that is.

134
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,433
To steal a kiss,
dare you.

135
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,950
Know that I am committed to
this connection.

136
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:58,558
I feel great,
and you? - Yes.

137
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:12,115
Are there windows, impatient
you that this is going on?

138
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:18,035
I know you, not
to be something

139
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,073
which is not only to
I felt good.

140
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,996
There's a clock ticking?
- He sent you somewhere?

141
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:34,750
It is always there for an hour and that
ticking until it explodes.

142
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,919
Let's talk, it's nice to me
about you, great

143
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:45,913
us going. I am happy.

144
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:51,990
If all of this grow
into something else,

145
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,753
and it can put me happy.

146
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:00,390
I love you.
- I love you.

147
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:12,955
Could this, it's yours.
You're in charge, Valentine.

148
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,919
I hope that
go well.

149
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:53,309
Brilliant moments are born
in excellent conditions.

150
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:57,599
That you have now, it's
deserved today.

151
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,758
Now we're talking speech
Kurt Russell from

152
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:03,916
the movie "Miracle."

153
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,794
I watched the kid
jutjuba before the other night.

154
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,790
Inspiring. Wherever you go
in competition

155
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,714
and to think that I
better.

156
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,555
're Nervous. Never
not, and now you are.

157
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,639
I must not break,
if I'm going to marry.

158
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:25,869
I knew it.

159
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:31,709
I will ask the following
month of birthday.

160
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,029
I passed favorably
the type of when

161
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,031
I met the
gamblers anonymous,

162
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,759
give me ring
20 thousand for 10

163
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,353
How so?
- I'll give him cash and

164
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:42,438
that he will fix you
circuits.

165
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,359
These two things to me
facilitate an agreement.

166
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:45,954
Helping with the car.

167
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,676
You told me, I thought
that will help.

168
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,556
It is my gift, no
Basket of fruit, this is it.

169
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,038
Decides.

170
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:03,116
I decide, it is my
gift. Takes care of your gift.

171
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,432
I tell Beth, I do not want her
be embarrassed.

172
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,354
Your choice.
- I'll do it.

173
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,319
If ten times thou
at the meeting, you may not.

174
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:19,551
Stop.
- Not this, not today.

175
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,228
're Nervous.

176
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:24,472
Today, we are the largest
small company in the world.

177
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,910
Enough of that
Other innovative.

178
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,477
This is our time
with them is over.

179
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,108
We arrive by taxi.

180
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,348
My three prototypes
rejected.

181
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:49,038
Bad luck, you will be
great, I promise.

182
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,349
Here you are.

183
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,749
Ladies and Gentlemen,
electric cars are gay.

184
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,753
The truth is, not
homosexual,

185
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:15,149
but your parents and your companions
at the dance gay.

186
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:19,229
I do not like to offend,
but we understand it.

187
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,876
New sanspit screaming this.

188
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,828
Here we are. Hundaji.
For granny.

189
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:40,273
?evrole, print.

190
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:50,151
Now look at this
1966th ford

191
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,315
GTE 350th
To drive in that?

192
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:02,433
1965th Pontiac,
GT8, brilliant.

193
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:07,875
1970, Himi where,
took more

194
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,038
innocence of Sinatra.

195
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,711
What do you suggest?
Use benefits

196
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,315
electrical transport but
in combination with

197
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,554
rock 'n' rolom and sekipilom
you currently have

198
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:26,590
Dodge models of cars.
Nicholas?

199
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,518
We believe that we can
to create technology

200
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:35,197
which would include electronic
engine in your models.

201
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:43,479
But with sound, vibration,
experience in which we

202
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,351
all adults and we love the
Dodge line.

203
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,949
We like the current
models and we agree

204
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,271
have a market for it
you want.

205
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,797
If you are looking to Dodge
invest in your concept,

206
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:02,397
What you do have, and
that we do not have?

207
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:07,233
Nick Brennan.

208
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:12,270
Forget in advance,
we deal with success,

209
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:13,595
because we have it.

210
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:16,992
I want 900 thousand, you
400.

211
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:21,353
I do not need to negotiate;
just to put on

212
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:24,951
center 775 and close.

213
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:31,432
I appreciate your spirit, but we
risk and

214
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,595
we stick with 400
thousand.

215
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:37,830
I concentrate on
Click to enlarge.

216
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,754
With the success and good
employment,

217
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:43,753
we will offer a contract
which means advance

218
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,516
and an option for long-term
contract with the company.

219
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:51,198
With that you will not be
disappointed.

220
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,678
You made a great decision
Today, thanks.

221
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,678
You supervise
Susan Warner.

222
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,629
Not from the company, but we have
great experience with it.

223
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,632
I was at Ford to
five months ago,

224
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,109
there are still talking
about you.

225
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:13,273
They say you can
izvrdate suppliers

226
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,352
to less than 15 cents
of dollars just a story.

227
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,553
You're mad scientist
days does not leave

228
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:19,676
laboratory.

229
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:25,594
Guys, our know-how
her. I am like you.

230
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:32,075
Visionary, maverick, as
you and what your vision ...

231
00:18:33,560 --> 00:18:37,712
Inspires me to, I have
serious stuff here.

232
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,510
I want your sex
words, you

233
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,353
Kresna brain.

234
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:51,075
Gotta go, late
the "mom and I," I'll call you.

235
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,518
It is full of enthusiasm.

236
00:18:54,800 --> 00:19:00,670
I have a panic attack,
and if I fail?

237
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,194
All we have invested,
mortgage loans.

238
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,676
Too fast to agreeing.

239
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,199
You said that
should be reintroduced.

240
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,911
I said that we
the short chain.

241
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,999
You say that we are
red zone?

242
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:18,589
If you can not?

243
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:24,071
Everyone will laugh at us,
and security. She looks at me.

244
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:31,753
Breathe, do not lose focus,
of 7 meters are

245
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,311
from the red zone, when
we enter, we are fortunate.

246
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:40,310
I do not care how you will
ukrasi? we are

247
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,791
at 25 percent until there
and difficult to breathe.

248
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:49,359
Relax, everything will be
OK.

249
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:56,435
I did not say that we
in the red zone.

250
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,151
Ten days of
meeting and more

251
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:08,589
has not calmed down, I give
best to

252
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:10,751
works, but is shaken.

253
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:15,156
Do show-show.
- Tell the waiters.

254
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,597
Know. - Do not know
are uneducated on the issue of fish.

255
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,195
And you? - Ibid.

256
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,595
How you doing?
- It's great I am.

257
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:32,795
16 months and 9 days
since I bet.

258
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,032
I'm not talking about gambling,
If you are under stress and

259
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,554
difficult to you.

260
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:44,798
If I am fortunate to have
themselves briefly,

261
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,639
the last thing I'll
I do the story.

262
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,877
Oh yeah?

263
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:12,670
When is her birthday?
- For two weeks.

264
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,835
We will have a Pacific tree.
- It will like it.

265
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,838
We have a program
hibernation this winter.

266
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,110
This is great.

267
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:27,672
About this talk, this
is beautiful and music.

268
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,274
People say that music
greatest art.

269
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,199
Go furthest and fastest
emotionally.

270
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,359
And smells are wonderful,
I want all the senses

271
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,478
come to life here.

272
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:41,994
Do you have an outlet
to connect the iPod.

273
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,991
We do not like the guests
touching the plant.

274
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,235
Grow if you talk
with them, I was pulled.

275
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:54,758
Just to upgrade the
all because I go by the ring

276
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:56,439
today, it will be taken care of?

277
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:57,869
I believe you will
take the ring.

278
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,992
I want this to be
best suit

279
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,711
in the history of all. That's it.

280
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,468
To see where
jack

281
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,233
Throw in three with the proposal.

282
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,477
One, two, three.
Proposal.

283
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:18,832
Go away, let it be
Well, count on you.

284
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,072
What am I doing here.

285
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,478
Bet.

286
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,755
CAUTION
DO NOT ENTER

287
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,073
Damn.

288
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,748
G. Valentine?

289
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,632
Son of a bitch.

290
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,349
Do not do it, Geneva.

291
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,239
God.

292
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,432
What are you doing?

293
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:32,270
These plants are poisonous.

294
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,993
Great.

295
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,198
Expect diarrhea, urine
possible with the blood,

296
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:46,872
fever, painful gums Islands
and loss of sensation in

297
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:52,228
language which will affect the
speech and bad dreams.

298
00:24:52,680 --> 00:24:55,638
Forever you
banned from entering the

299
00:24:55,960 --> 00:24:57,791
garden, forget about the
marriage proposal here.

300
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,838
We are not friends.

301
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,712
The damage is arranged.

302
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:11,109
I saw a woman the best
friends with another man.

303
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,351
I will send you a check.

304
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:16,909
It's red.

305
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,668
And upset.

306
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,673
I thought you
allergic to anything.

307
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,952
Neither do I. - What kind of plants?

308
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,031
Street plants.
- Street?

309
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:40,037
I walked Clark's
and the kid loses the ball

310
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,110
and I had the bushes
the ball.

311
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,359
Why could not they?
- Today, children are lazy.

312
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:49,036
With games, messages and
hepi Mill,

313
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:52,676
overweight children
out of control.

314
00:25:53,040 --> 00:26:00,151
Blew and sweated as they are.
- They could get their ball.

315
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:04,030
Made an effort, but not
could do it.

316
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:12,399
Then I came and
asked me.

317
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:17,350
I think that late,
but want to play and

318
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,755
I support having
we are all on the same

319
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,234
health, paying
for the fat kids.

320
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:23,199
I go to the ground and
I try to

321
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:26,671
picked up the ball and not
I want to hit me a branch.

322
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:32,319
I dig the branch and
my hand goes here.

323
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,195
That's why we did this here,
direct contact.

324
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:42,477
Catch the ball, returning
them to move house and

325
00:26:43,480 --> 00:26:46,677
I noticed that my arm
itchy and because

326
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,513
I was on otrljao
bush.

327
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:54,037
What do you need so much money?
- I went to

328
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:59,838
suppliers, but fortunately
that has occurred here.

329
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:05,919
Imagine that occurred there.
- A lot of cash.

330
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,469
They work with cash.
- I can not tell

331
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:14,395
of all the details, just
itchy, I'm going to fix it.

332
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:21,278
How you spent your day?
- Good.

333
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:30,199
God. Damn.
- Are you okay?

334
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,113
Little pain.

335
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:08,397
Interrupt.

336
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,188
Manage data.
Let's go.

337
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:22,078
We need to talk.
- We got the loan

338
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:25,670
from the bank?
- Not yet, but I have to.

339
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,035
You've got to go, I
I signed before

340
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,349
two days, you and you.

341
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:32,713
Susan from Chrysler
constantly called.

342
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,790
How to concentrate
while constantly calling.

343
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,318
You have to be there to get ume?a?.
- Yes.

344
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,795
Again boil?

345
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:46,789
This is a prescription
medicine, can not

346
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:50,675
it is drunk.
Give me a moment.

347
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,915
Guys, wake up the beast.

348
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,278
We have adequate measures
This time, looks good.

349
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:00,638
It is pathetic.
- We need to talk.

350
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:01,949
Do you act to do?

351
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:03,474
David, jumps in, come on.

352
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:15,399
Come on.

353
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:20,994
Finally seeing fractions.

354
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:28,755
Head.

355
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:33,959
It happens.

356
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,388
That's right!

357
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,954
Wait, deviations
fractions. - Give.

358
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,512
No, to hell!

359
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:55,315
Lzgubili are complete.

360
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:59,109
Much better head valves,
second and third were ...

361
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,475
I know I'm bad.

362
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:12,633
Nick, listen.
- What do you want?

363
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:16,350
To discuss
something personal.

364
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:21,279
Has nothing to do with anything
this, just come

365
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,316
to the office.

366
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:25,712
To discuss
something as personal

367
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:27,439
has nothing to do with this?
- Right.

368
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,389
I'm bleeding inside, the blood is
when not appropriate.

369
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,198
I vomited four
times in two days

370
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:37,512
it makes no sense because
I ate three.

371
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:38,637
I do not know where from.

372
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:42,350
I understand what you are saying.
- You're not under pressure.

373
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,278
When I said that
I'm on a short chain,

374
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:48,678
I did, I am very still,
we are deep in the problem.

375
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,796
And attacking me from all
parties, and big they are.

376
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:59,509
I turned to you, your
main blocker and you

377
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,270
tell me to talk
about something personal.

378
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:07,271
Only a block, it works.

379
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,833
I sign forms that
can somehow

380
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,157
finance its disaster
or to forgive

381
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,953
of long-term contract.

382
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,757
Unbelievable. - It is ridiculous.

383
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:36,149
It was necessary to cross Nou
was open.

384
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,555
I can not put together.

385
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,829
Rose does not believe Noi
not believed to be that.

386
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:51,510
Because the trust must
to be great in the team.

387
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:52,996
You have to believe a team-mate,
can you believe

388
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,918
his teammate and out
courts? - Sure.

389
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:58,757
Hypothetically, that Noah
learns that Rose

390
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,998
Girl cheats, whether to
tell him or not, because

391
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,508
does not want to affect the
his performance?

392
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:09,076
He says, is toxic
keep to myself.

393
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,510
This is the best friend.

394
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,513
You've heard the expression,
"Kill the messenger"?

395
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:17,673
Does not apply if you do not say
best friend

396
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:19,553
then you kre?e?.

397
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:26,073
Depends on whether the play-off.
- Championship Final.

398
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,476
I would not tell him.
- Wait.

399
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:36,554
Only occur.
- Never to do it.

400
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,234
I watched the episode
"Jerry Springer"

401
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:43,757
and always think of it,
women learned

402
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:49,029
for husbands best friend
cheats and did not say

403
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,549
friend.
- Why are you talking about?

404
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:54,071
Just to hear that
I had to tell her?

405
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:55,834
Of course.

406
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,035
And that "kill the messenger."
- It seems the service friend.

407
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:03,716
No matter how painful.
- Mom, come on.

408
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,879
I gotta go, bye.

409
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:13,793
Sister house

410
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:20,479
Fine fora, women
emissions. Bullshit.

411
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,270
I'm not an idiot, tell me
if I'm cheating Sol.

412
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:28,519
Diane, do not talk about
Sol. - I will kill him.

413
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:32,513
I thought no more
I choose men who

414
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:36,749
the father, who would not sleep
with them?

415
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,835
Exaggerating.

416
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,431
How can that we
talking on the phone?

417
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:50,154
How dare you at all.
Fuck you, yet you were selfish.

418
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,871
Why me? - Carried.

419
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,635
Jesus.

420
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:07,356
That's better.

421
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:08,869
Roni, wait.

422
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:15,114
Roni, to talk.
- I'm going upstairs.

423
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,036
Just a moment
it is important.

424
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,269
Come on.

425
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:42,118
I'm so sorry.
Too much thinking about myself.

426
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,756
I am angry because the school did not
loud enough.

427
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,032
I have eight minutes.

428
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,269
I have a call in five to
helmets and to tell me

429
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:00,036
something about emissions, and
I have 8 minutes to

430
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:02,710
talk about what
you want.

431
00:35:12,040 --> 00:35:21,119
Roni, I have 7 minutes and
49 seconds, open up.

432
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,029
I wanted to talk
o. ..

433
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:43,910
The proposal Bet.
- There are not, why?

434
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,031
I was not sure of
place.

435
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:52,832
Sabotira?, everything will be
OK, you found the right.

436
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:57,956
What's that on your arm?
- I had a rash.

437
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:06,199
When pi?am same.
- Ronnie, Nick, come.

438
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,192
These are sexy cars.

439
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,872
Only saves fuel.

440
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,754
What are you doing here?
Lznena?enje.

441
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:21,479
We have special plans
for tonight.

442
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,189
I do not have time for tonight,
too late.

443
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:31,908
Because you burn, you have
to fill the battery.

444
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,759
We have no time
for it.

445
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,593
I do not know if that's tonight
well.

446
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,552
I do not want to celebrate because there
anything you get,

447
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:43,912
no celebrations, only
to cool to

448
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:47,915
set the table for possible
celebration in the future.

449
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:54,313
I called to speak,
Felix said that

450
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:55,908
things are still heated
and you need a vacation.

451
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:02,596
No discussion, we will do
it. You'll thank me later.

452
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:06,519
What happened to your face?

453
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,672
Ten years to
to hit it.

454
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:31,633
The last contestant,
Jessica Hill from llinoisa.

455
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:34,232
That's the one without a brain.

456
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:40,191
I have a third result
in the state.

457
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:43,718
Third, it was plain
team.

458
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:47,480
Why do I unaza?uje?
abilities.

459
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,156
I'm a scorer, elections
with it.

460
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:52,196
Call me a sniper.

461
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,232
It is not easy to guess
with center ice.

462
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,870
No, because the few of us
it can. I can do this.

463
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,671
Did you ever?
- No, it does not matter, I believe.

464
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,953
It is not a network, but
this small hole.

465
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,276
They know what they are doing, statistics
which indicates that the

466
00:38:12,600 --> 00:38:13,828
a number of people
miss.

467
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:19,951
I see different things,
like you're in a dream.

468
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,155
Like you're in between and
you move in slow motion

469
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,391
and see what happens and
before they happen.

470
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,475
I go for beer,
You want something?

471
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,957
I'm going to help her,
You need something?

472
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,233
All night to dopisuje?.

473
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:59,910
I saw you yesterday.
- Where?

474
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:03,949
In the botanical garden.
- Well?

475
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:10,350
I saw everything, type
with a dirty shirt,

476
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:11,949
as it is in the midst Ijubi?
days.

477
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:15,398
I understood.
- You have a great type

478
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,675
that the pa?Ijiv
Men.

479
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,479
He cares you,
a cheat him.

480
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,231
Not all heaped on me,
how dare you

481
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:23,788
attacking me with that
you think you know.

482
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,712
I saw
the Ijubaka?.

483
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:31,160
You do not know what's going on
behind the curtain of marriage.

484
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,352
Do not sleep with
me over six months.

485
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:35,874
Do not talk nonsense.

486
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:40,153
And every Thursday
after work, Nick

487
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:43,153
going to a massage, where he
izdrka

488
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,593
nineteen
Girl from Vietnam

489
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,558
who speaks four words
English, and it?

490
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:52,152
I do not believe a word,
You cover only.

491
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,156
It is my best friend
the world and

492
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:03,274
I will not hide from it.

493
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:07,756
I tell you and give
you a chance, but you have to

494
00:40:08,080 --> 00:40:08,876
this cen ...

495
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:14,188
This is because my husband ...
- Not advisor, not

496
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,471
I want it to be, that
simplify.

497
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:22,917
Or tell him you, or I will.
- I can not.

498
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,877
I want it.
- Do not.

499
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:32,873
Do not do this while going
job.

500
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,958
Nick does not sleep at night,
His stomach bleeding.

501
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:41,431
Be destroyed by it.
- No Vidjas with the guy?

502
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:47,356
It was stupid, I know,
because it is almost not there.

503
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:50,838
Why did you write the whole
evening? - Do.

504
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:56,470
Be the BlackBerry.
Enjoy.

505
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,194
Sister you bought a new
dress.

506
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,270
I said, I do not know anything.

507
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:11,917
Promise to give him
say when this is over?

508
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:15,357
And for a guy, Promise?
- I swear.

509
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:53,511
I am disappointed in you.
- Good.

510
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:09,074
Choose date and ask
Beth to marry you.

511
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,389
You make more fuss than
you need.

512
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:16,549
Because of you I am under
stress. Completely.

513
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:24,913
You're right when you say.
Creating additional stress.

514
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:38,031
Once you go to a massage
in stressful times.

515
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,949
No.

516
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:47,311
Can I have a small but
Pros learn from the

517
00:42:47,800 --> 00:42:51,395
to you.

518
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:58,189
You know what is so great that
together we go to a massage.

519
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:04,153
Not the same room, same
Salon, do you know where?

520
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,195
To just relax?

521
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:11,591
Do not let fear
sabotage in happiness.

522
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,758
It's great you go along,
love you.

523
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:18,197
And the love of rewards and
meets.

524
00:43:19,520 --> 00:43:22,592
As a warm stew, and
is.

525
00:43:23,560 --> 00:43:27,917
If you want ice cream,
go and take it.

526
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:30,953
Do not worry that you will
get chest pains

527
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:36,434
and skrene? and kill
a bunch of people and children.

528
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:40,754
You take the ice cream and 99%
You will end up in the shop

529
00:43:41,080 --> 00:43:42,798
with a huge ice cream.

530
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:51,314
Only one percent
kill the innocent.

531
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,033
Good chance.

532
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,470
I do not understand what you are saying.

533
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,872
Tomorrow night is the anniversary of
best parents.

534
00:44:04,360 --> 00:44:08,672
40 years, something you can
to learn. Absorbs it.

535
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:17,153
And we have entered the red zone.

536
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,319
Sorry, I do not you
be uncomfortable

537
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,558
I perverzanjak,
I'm sorry.

538
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:47,432
Too bad. - What?

539
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:52,275
I say the damage is.

540
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:15,077
RONI

541
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:21,592
Yes? - Just like to thank
support today.

542
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:24,116
No problem.

543
00:45:25,120 --> 00:45:29,432
What are you doing?
- At home I have.

544
00:45:30,560 --> 00:45:34,951
Am.

545
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:39,149
We go for a beer?
- The Geneva alone.

546
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:42,633
I have little to
emissions.

547
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:47,757
What are you looking at? No Peek,
or you come or go.

548
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,508
Idem. - Go.

549
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,515
You go.

550
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:56,434
Who is it?
- Policeman close

551
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,195
Northern Boulevard,
the jerk.

552
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,914
I do not drive, walk.

553
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:06,910
Hi, honey,
usre?i?emo you.

554
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,751
When you go, sme?i?e?
as if you removed the prosthesis.

555
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:16,238
The girl looks forward to
to see you.

556
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,952
I have to go.
- What was that?

557
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:22,357
The film was on TV.
- We hear it.

558
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,554
We can about everything,
I thought tonight

559
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:31,873
we can have a drink.
- I have to go. - Waiting.

560
00:46:42,080 --> 00:46:48,553
Razmi?Ijao about what I
you said with a curtain.

561
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,709
I am also fair to
you and I understand that

562
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,918
in any story there
the two sides.

563
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,073
You followed him to the salon
Massage?

564
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:05,152
Just to tell you that
not fudge anything you say.

565
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:08,870
I hope you
solve the problems.

566
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,434
I do not want to be
in the middle of this.

567
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:18,237
You hit.
- Who is it? Where are you?

568
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,713
At home.
- Just shoot,

569
00:47:22,520 --> 00:47:25,114
you do not have a pool table.

570
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:26,310
I have to go.

571
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:27,396
What to do with those that
you will not see

572
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:28,948
until you talk to
Anyone.

573
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:32,278
Good night. - Good Night, and
Make sure you

574
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:33,436
're ready to talk
with her husband when

575
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,439
go home because I want it.

576
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:42,433
Inhale, and something needs to be
to hear before.

577
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,031
What is it?
- I ordered coffee.

578
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,788
I do not need, we have
nothing to discuss.

579
00:48:09,120 --> 00:48:11,680
Go to Nick and say
'll tell him that his

580
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:15,509
Women's twisted and lying.

581
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:20,676
That he is married with
Helen Keller.

582
00:48:23,440 --> 00:48:25,670
Who is she? - Girl
with multiple personalities.

583
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:29,839
Who were you today
what happened today?

584
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:36,799
You are a child on the playground.
When my husband called

585
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:40,755
to explain the delayed meeting
be clear.

586
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,678
Zip is called a guy?

587
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,272
I do not want this, I love
husband.

588
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:53,112
It's strange to show it.
- Stay away from my life.

589
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:55,354
You are not a therapist, you
one needs.

590
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,717
Look at you, you have 40,
you ?enjen, center yourself

591
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:02,316
so call me.
- I have nothing to tell.

592
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,032
One only has to go
and I say to Niko

593
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:09,875
his wife cheating and I believe
because you could not

594
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,439
do what you need.
So will have.

595
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,519
I see it differently.

596
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:23,552
Porica?u and I will say that
romanced me.

597
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:27,277
I to you? - Given
our secret

598
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:29,515
We will believe me.

599
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:37,273
We decided not to
say anything because

600
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:41,229
you love him not to destroy
something good for

601
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:42,549
drunken nights that
occurred three months

602
00:49:42,840 --> 00:49:44,478
before you and
started coming out.

603
00:49:45,400 --> 00:49:50,155
He does not know.
- Meant nothing.

604
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,439
Now means.

605
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:58,956
Thus it will be, I will tell
him that we were sleeping

606
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:02,915
all those years ago and
You started to udvara?

607
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:06,558
and that it did not stop.

608
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:12,279
Sell it to him, that I
it for 20 years.

609
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:22,954
It took the earlier you
I say, but Ronnie

610
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:28,274
insisted not to say
nothing, but as the

611
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:29,629
passing year
it has become increasingly difficult

612
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,117
and lying to myself to
it does not matter.

613
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,994
Now I am telling you because
Ronnie was mad.

614
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,993
Attack me in the restaurant,
When you're around the corner, as

615
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:49,273
he wants to see that
catch it.

616
00:50:49,600 --> 00:50:53,559
Feels wrong.
I do not feel safe.

617
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:58,273
I had to say.

618
00:51:04,200 --> 00:51:08,751
What are you going then?
The moral?

619
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,709
Gleda?e? best
friends and lie to

620
00:51:13,000 --> 00:51:15,036
it did not happen?

621
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:23,920
I think you will.
Stay away from my marriage.

622
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:31,593
Izvini?e? me, good night.

623
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:58,589
I do not know if you are up,
I did not even named after

624
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:01,912
I asked when salons
it was difficult to

625
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:03,315
I know I can not help
for my own good because

626
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:06,876
something had to
learn.

627
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:18,871
I will not learn anything.
I do not want to lose

628
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:21,833
his best friend.

629
00:52:22,120 --> 00:52:28,798
I know I need you
give something, but I'm afraid.

630
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:34,749
If you listen to me and want
to help around

631
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:38,516
Chrysler it would be
great.

632
00:52:42,840 --> 00:52:46,549
That's all, if you listen.

633
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,839
TONIGHT MY GODl?NICA
PARENTS IN EIGHT, RONI

634
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:26,430
DO NOT ZABORAVl?,

635
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:50,197
Yes? - Can you get
Bet?

636
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:53,836
Not here, you have
message? - Thanks, no.

637
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:08,951
Good morning, get
You Kirn group, please.

638
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:13,118
I count d500
inefficient pixels.

639
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:16,079
Density of 2, 7 pixels.

640
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,952
Whether from afar?
- Certainly.

641
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:21,269
Shooting birds?
- Yes.

642
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:26,112
What kind?
- Neverne.

643
00:54:28,720 --> 00:54:32,315
Yes? - I, we
to see, it's important.

644
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,359
Who is it? - Susan Warner,
Advisor Dodge.

645
00:54:38,320 --> 00:54:41,039
I thought we
the same territory.

646
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,512
We did. What is it?

647
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:46,153
Drag in Reno
Chrysler immediately,

648
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,948
not this over the phone.

649
00:54:49,320 --> 00:54:52,596
Work force here, but
here it comes to your

650
00:54:53,200 --> 00:55:00,834
engine in this car.
Sound and vibration.

651
00:55:02,440 --> 00:55:03,873
What's the problem?

652
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:08,110
Thomas liked the idea,
but does not want to depend on

653
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:11,949
from BMW to make
and it rejected the design.

654
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,396
No can do, it is
our idea.

655
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:17,792
Thus, caring for
Nike, will end up,

656
00:55:18,120 --> 00:55:21,999
could it?
- Nick is a genius.

657
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:26,632
That is why I am telling you, on your
I page.

658
00:55:29,240 --> 00:55:30,070
I appreciate it.

659
00:55:31,800 --> 00:55:36,271
You watched that movie.
"Deep Throat"?

660
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:39,151
Great.

661
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:44,034
Tell me when
United presented a design?

662
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:48,828
For three days.
- Unbelievable.

663
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:53,752
I'm not thought of this period,
but we have to.

664
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,632
Felix, call Nike.
- Asleep in the car from '68.

665
00:55:56,680 --> 00:55:59,990
Do you wake up?
- Tell me when you wake up.

666
00:56:00,360 --> 00:56:02,237
Here we have your
data.

667
00:56:03,120 --> 00:56:05,714
Kirn group of Las
Vegas lead

668
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:08,830
celebrity restaurants
Vegas.

669
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:15,676
Thanks, I have to go.

670
00:59:02,320 --> 00:59:06,154
Yes? - Ronnie, where are you?

671
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:11,469
I do some things
with fine men.

672
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:18,590
I got your message,
three days, I do not think so.

673
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,989
I think we are close,
but the rest depends on you.

674
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:24,668
You will have to do it.

675
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:29,032
Why do you sound like
you're on drugs.

676
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:31,630
're Brilliant in their
work, you're a wonderful man.

677
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,109
Here they are.

678
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:11,798
Hi, Dad, Mom.

679
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:21,956
Where's Ronnie?
- Arrives, he had a job.

680
01:00:42,920 --> 01:00:44,638
Get out of here.

681
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:20,639
Where are you going?

682
01:01:28,120 --> 01:01:30,350
You fell into the wrong house.

683
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,394
Are you looking for fun?
You'll get something.

684
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:37,593
Come, Comrade.

685
01:01:38,440 --> 01:01:40,032
I drank bensedin ago
20 minutes.

686
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:41,950
I will not be felt,
Come on.

687
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,150
We can talk.

688
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:57,792
My fish.

689
01:02:02,120 --> 01:02:06,432
You think you're safe
inside? We'll see.

690
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:15,596
're Finished, you hear me?

691
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,198
You have no where to go.

692
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:27,751
We will burn you. - What are you doing?

693
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:38,195
We will burn you, you better run away.

694
01:02:48,720 --> 01:02:51,951
Where are you, madman?

695
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:54,513
Show up.

696
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:59,754
Better run, better for you
there tonight.

697
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,309
I know where you live.
Remember that.

698
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:13,392
I know where you live.
I will be back.

699
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:20,279
I will burn your face.
I can not wait.

700
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:27,276
Waiting for the good
burn.

701
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:31,390
Carries with it.

702
01:03:59,120 --> 01:04:00,519
Come here.

703
01:04:00,800 --> 01:04:05,191
This is from the collection.
- What are you, that they burned the face?

704
01:04:06,240 --> 01:04:11,553
I will not. - Who are you?
You will not tell me.

705
01:04:15,360 --> 01:04:17,237
I am the best friend
her husband.

706
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:21,279
Shit.

707
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:25,590
Why do not you say?
- I tried.

708
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:28,278
Wait a minute.

709
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:36,835
Stop, do not be childish.

710
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,233
Stop.

711
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:51,390
Do it, garbage, strikes
me in the head.

712
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:52,914
Finish it today, I will return
be.

713
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:56,878
I will finish it today.

714
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,115
Nick is ten times higher
man than you.

715
01:04:59,640 --> 01:05:03,110
You're not nothing, you bastard.

716
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:10,555
I did not ... need
two, you know it.

717
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,872
Yes, two, not three.

718
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:25,437
Pattinson
- No, of oxygen.

719
01:05:31,120 --> 01:05:31,836
Get out of here.

720
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,752
I'm not going to play
with you.

721
01:05:37,280 --> 01:05:38,998
I will not.

722
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,518
I'll have a sweater.

723
01:06:36,640 --> 01:06:40,679
Ronnie, you look terrible.
- But it is a good jumper.

724
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,833
I know I'm late, but
I am ok.

725
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,754
What happened to your face?
- Fighting in the bar.

726
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,275
Some bikers.

727
01:06:52,400 --> 01:06:57,633
Really?
- I was at Zipa.

728
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,476
The real horror, do not go there,
remove the GPS.

729
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:03,309
Where's the band?

730
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:06,271
We need to talk.

731
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:15,869
There is something wrong with
you, and if you need me,

732
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:21,992
fuck and run the project,
I'm here for you.

733
01:07:23,760 --> 01:07:26,433
Ronnie, you look terrible.

734
01:07:28,920 --> 01:07:34,597
I pressed the Solo and admitted
to deceive.

735
01:07:35,800 --> 01:07:41,033
Now we'll work on it
for children.

736
01:07:41,360 --> 01:07:47,469
You have to try because
of all the bowling, and it is not.

737
01:07:48,120 --> 01:07:49,075
Ronnie?

738
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:55,789
Well you touched?

739
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:59,915
Ronnie, remember my
brother James and

740
01:08:00,520 --> 01:08:02,590
his boyfriend Vaughn?

741
01:08:05,400 --> 01:08:09,712
Let me finish.
- For the family touch.

742
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:12,312
Only with the crowded
mine.

743
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,834
I'm glad.

744
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:20,077
And my parents.
- Ronald?

745
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:26,634
Bert and Sue, 40 bright
years.

746
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:28,752
It's wonderful that there is a fire
after 40 years.

747
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:33,559
It is still there.
- No doubt you.

748
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,189
Let's do this.
Have fun.

749
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,236
Breath by breath gives new
life.

750
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:49,197
Thousands and thousands of kisses,
give me, I beg.

751
01:08:49,520 --> 01:08:55,277
Love loves all without
conditions and the love there is no law.

752
01:08:56,600 --> 01:09:02,630
Mom and dad, your
The love of no law.

753
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:18,830
I would like to propose a toast.

754
01:09:25,240 --> 01:09:29,233
For 40 years, it is
long to be with someone.

755
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,233
Amazing. I do not know
much about the marriage,

756
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:44,676
but certainly not easy because
People are not perfect.

757
01:09:45,360 --> 01:09:50,832
People make mistakes, but I believe
you're gone

758
01:09:51,200 --> 01:10:00,791
with sincerity and only
with time.

759
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,038
I love.

760
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:09,119
Above it is honesty.
- Do not forget patience.

761
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,351
It will not, relax.

762
01:10:14,960 --> 01:10:20,557
I'm talking about two people
who have been fooling around there vamo.

763
01:10:21,720 --> 01:10:27,033
Bert certainly was informing the
many girls

764
01:10:28,160 --> 01:10:29,559
much.

765
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:37,078
Handsome guy, nice,
was a real dream.

766
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:41,632
See Su, beautiful
women, it is easy to be with her.

767
01:10:42,480 --> 01:10:47,713
She is Tight and had
the pool and get a guy

768
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:53,598
to clean. Many young
they came.

769
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,319
And if something happens, do not
know whether,

770
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:57,159
It's up to them, they were
honest, she was

771
01:10:57,520 --> 01:11:01,593
certainly recognize that
it is the only one, but

772
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,117
Mom might be thirsty.

773
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,511
Will focus here
the ingredient that all

774
01:11:10,800 --> 01:11:14,475
links, and that is honesty.
- And common interests.

775
01:11:15,680 --> 01:11:18,990
Who are you?
- Cousin Bette.

776
01:11:19,920 --> 01:11:22,593
First generation?
- Other.

777
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:27,431
This is not a group toast
or forum.

778
01:11:28,040 --> 01:11:31,157
I stand and I
glass, I say.

779
01:11:31,480 --> 01:11:36,190
Bert and are OK, but they
fame, but not you.

780
01:11:37,520 --> 01:11:39,238
Nobody cares
you.

781
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:44,192
You're the second generation,
which is not the right kind

782
01:11:44,480 --> 01:11:47,119
because one can not sleep
with other knee

783
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:49,078
and child can be
normal.

784
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:59,435
Honesty, you can not
escape, and believe me,

785
01:12:00,760 --> 01:12:09,555
will find you.
The truth will find you.

786
01:12:12,680 --> 01:12:18,710
For Bert and Sue, 40 years
sincerity. Congratulations.

787
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:24,036
Can we
talk in the kitchen?

788
01:12:24,440 --> 01:12:26,078
Please.

789
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:46,275
What happens?
- I toasted sincerity.

790
01:12:46,560 --> 01:12:50,394
I'm not talking about inappropriate
toast the anniversary

791
01:12:50,720 --> 01:12:53,792
my parents, or hail
in a bar or allergy

792
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:55,354
from the street while plants
're chasing a fat children

793
01:12:55,720 --> 01:12:59,474
I wonder what's in your head
What causes this?

794
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:08,510
I have something to fix it
and you can not inhale.

795
01:13:08,920 --> 01:13:10,433
This would lead to my
ability to do that.

796
01:13:11,040 --> 01:13:12,439
What? - To improve.

797
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:23,393
Not fixing anything
and to break down more. Enough said.

798
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,597
The whole speech you gave on
honesty, it's time

799
01:13:27,920 --> 01:13:28,909
to be honest with
me.

800
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:34,675
If so, you start.
Why do not you tell me

801
01:13:35,200 --> 01:13:36,519
for Kirn group.

802
01:13:38,280 --> 01:13:42,956
How do you know that?
- Are you going to Vegas, to

803
01:13:43,280 --> 01:13:45,111
leave me? - No.

804
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:52,832
They asked me to open
restaurants in

805
01:13:53,480 --> 01:13:56,950
and I refused.
- Why?

806
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,959
That would mean I would
had to go to

807
01:14:00,280 --> 01:14:03,158
I live in Vegas
several years in. ..

808
01:14:06,240 --> 01:14:07,559
So what?

809
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:14,912
And there you do not believe it.

810
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:25,030
Look at you, call me
is your sponsor.

811
01:14:25,640 --> 01:14:28,552
You're not going to meetings,
setas with great

812
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:32,475
Cash and I feel
as two years ago.

813
01:14:33,840 --> 01:14:39,949
I can now with you.
- If you do not let go,

814
01:14:40,760 --> 01:14:43,274
how to know what to
I do, how can I help?

815
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:47,679
It would be best to leave.
- I do not want to go.

816
01:14:55,320 --> 01:14:58,471
Sleeping in the office
tonight.

817
01:14:58,880 --> 01:15:00,950
Uradi?e? it?

818
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:29,878
What are you doing?
- I watch as you sleep.

819
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:31,429
Creepy said.

820
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:36,870
Felix, play with
girls on the net.

821
01:15:37,560 --> 01:15:40,870
You are too, I do not know
where I am.

822
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:54,078
God. - What happens?

823
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,036
Enter. - Ubi?e? me
porch in the middle of the day,

824
01:15:58,360 --> 01:16:01,716
You crazy?
- No, if you're in the house.

825
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:05,272
I Izguglao this.
You know how you doing?

826
01:16:05,600 --> 01:16:07,556
You come inside and I
defend.

827
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:10,434
I will empty the drum,
act crazy.

828
01:16:12,400 --> 01:16:15,358
I'll just three, as
quiet gun.

829
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:19,271
I came only
at the event.

830
01:16:23,480 --> 01:16:25,835
Camera, go.

831
01:16:26,680 --> 01:16:29,513
If you want, here.

832
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,758
I know that everything was
crazy and that I have

833
01:16:33,520 --> 01:16:36,398
damaged many more.

834
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:42,399
You killed my fish.

835
01:16:43,560 --> 01:16:47,109
Why? - I need you
to compensate,

836
01:16:48,280 --> 01:16:51,670
it is a friend, but what
the fish did.

837
01:16:52,280 --> 01:16:56,831
Fish said to take
camera and

838
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:02,115
leave it all behind
themselves.

839
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:06,311
Ten thousand.
- Five hundred.

840
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:11,558
Five thousand.
- I have a thousand.

841
01:17:12,200 --> 01:17:14,191
I give you a thousand.
- I apologize.

842
01:17:14,680 --> 01:17:19,959
If your gun
pointed at me, do not count.

843
01:17:21,280 --> 01:17:22,474
Well said.

844
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,992
I'm sorry for what
what happened.

845
01:17:27,280 --> 01:17:33,037
I need to see
it. To come from the heart.

846
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:42,716
I'm really sorry that
We are in this situation.

847
01:17:53,040 --> 01:17:54,234
Good.

848
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,510
I 400 I owe to
home elderly.

849
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:23,831
You're done this,
you know it.

850
01:18:24,640 --> 01:18:29,555
I do not take weapons.
I'm sensitive.

851
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:38,549
Thanks.

852
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,675
Ride pa?Ijivo.

853
01:19:00,160 --> 01:19:02,196
Who are you?

854
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:11,597
You have no choice, you
to tell him.

855
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:16,269
It is easy, you have a picture,
you can not fake.

856
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:23,111
Come here, I love you.
You will find someone else.

857
01:19:23,560 --> 01:19:25,357
You're a great guy.
I love you.

858
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,512
Just walk.

859
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:51,189
Ronnie?

860
01:20:00,240 --> 01:20:03,073
We wanted to call you,
We wanted to be

861
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:06,477
ready, but we can
begin.

862
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:09,998
Join us.
- Who are you?

863
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:13,317
I'm Dr. Rozenstoun,
your friends and family

864
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:17,588
are here because they love and
can not you see

865
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:19,638
how to destroy.
- This is an intervention?

866
01:20:20,600 --> 01:20:23,592
There is no need for
names, these are friends

867
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:26,394
speaking and one
speak to like it.

868
01:20:27,600 --> 01:20:30,910
Sister and husband want to
start.

869
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:33,117
I know that I
tortured.

870
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,908
I believe you, but here I am
for you.

871
01:20:43,480 --> 01:20:46,119
I do not know how you
learned, but I will

872
01:20:46,400 --> 01:20:49,039
kill if we
re-do it.

873
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:53,595
Get everyone to sit.

874
01:20:57,240 --> 01:20:59,800
We have a big blue
chair for you.

875
01:21:03,360 --> 01:21:07,990
It is no coincidence that we
here in the circle of support.

876
01:21:11,160 --> 01:21:17,713
Is it too late?
- Certainly, bad late.

877
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:20,988
Bet. - Hello.

878
01:21:21,640 --> 01:21:24,359
Who's it called?
- I.

879
01:21:26,040 --> 01:21:29,396
I followed you today
to it.

880
01:21:31,680 --> 01:21:34,592
I saw him
pay and then I

881
01:21:34,920 --> 01:21:36,558
he said. He writes here.

882
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,234
PATIENT

883
01:21:38,920 --> 01:21:42,230
It is best to have all
present, even

884
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:45,194
bettors, he agreed
I have to pay your

885
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,391
debt if he agrees
to come tonight.

886
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,513
And yes, thank you.
- It's nice of you.

887
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:57,557
It is not my bookie.
- Admit it, Kladis at all.

888
01:21:57,960 --> 01:21:59,359
How dare you
come.

889
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:03,191
It is rubbish.

890
01:22:05,320 --> 01:22:08,630
I asked.
- Do not kill the messenger.

891
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:18,916
These are the socks, balls,
and play, I do not want you to.

892
01:22:21,000 --> 01:22:23,878
This is supposed to
I do long ago.

893
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:28,751
You need to look at this.

894
01:22:38,400 --> 01:22:40,960
Only yarn paintings.

895
01:22:41,680 --> 01:22:45,753
I turn and returns to
only one.

896
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,719
You can not shoot
on something that has not happened.

897
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:59,273
Son of a bitch.
- Roni!

898
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,877
Calm down, they shall kill him.

899
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,391
It is not my bookie.

900
01:23:07,240 --> 01:23:09,037
You're mad.

901
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:17,550
I would love to be entertained,
you are crazy.

902
01:23:23,520 --> 01:23:26,159
Here you should
talk and

903
01:23:26,560 --> 01:23:27,834
share the concern.

904
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:32,397
Let me, I have
something to say.

905
01:23:33,640 --> 01:23:35,073
Sit all.

906
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,319
Just let me.

907
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:47,994
This was important for me.

908
01:23:50,040 --> 01:23:51,393
Please.

909
01:23:54,360 --> 01:23:59,388
I have not had much
Friend, I was

910
01:24:03,840 --> 01:24:05,876
shy, you know it all.

911
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:12,760
Do not you know that when you
moved to

912
01:24:13,080 --> 01:24:16,231
second semester,
all I did

913
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:23,156
to become familiar.
You were fun and all

914
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,478
they loved him.

915
01:24:28,200 --> 01:24:30,077
Enough, let me.

916
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:37,912
Listen, you are my
best friend.

917
01:24:38,800 --> 01:24:42,429
Because you've always
better, careful not to screw up next.

918
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:47,676
Never forget
what is important.

919
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:52,237
When I returned before
two years, I

920
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:54,909
just lost money.

921
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,109
I betrayed you.
- This is a catharsis.

922
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:04,478
You know that I had
brother.

923
01:25:09,840 --> 01:25:15,915
Dad has often been there.
I have become friends

924
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,750
criminals, when we
met,

925
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:26,957
I saw it and I
to you.

926
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:39,832
It should be something that you know,
I should say.

927
01:25:40,640 --> 01:25:43,518
Geneva and the weld
type for which you

928
01:25:43,800 --> 01:25:45,199
I thought that I was a bookmaker.

929
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,750
You thought you saw
exchange, but not

930
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:54,999
gambling, I went
the device due to the image.

931
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:00,872
Do not gamble at all,
I thought so

932
01:26:01,440 --> 01:26:06,719
to tell you that
handle this.

933
01:26:08,640 --> 01:26:12,155
Is it true?
- No. Lie.

934
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:16,077
Gambler is, to say the
everything is terrible.

935
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,950
Tell the truth, all listen.

936
01:26:37,440 --> 01:26:41,479
What did you expect, you
You want a happy ending.

937
01:26:46,120 --> 01:26:48,076
You left me alone,
I wanted to be

938
01:26:48,440 --> 01:26:50,431
with you.
- I do not want about it now.

939
01:26:51,120 --> 01:26:53,031
That is the problem,
never want to.

940
01:26:54,000 --> 01:26:58,357
I know that it was difficult
and that's my fault,

941
01:26:59,000 --> 01:27:02,709
but there is something in us.

942
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:12,272
How do you know, a few
days, too.

943
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:14,996
I do not know what to say,
or what I feel.

944
01:27:15,840 --> 01:27:19,435
I know it's supposed to
earlier to tell me.

945
01:27:20,240 --> 01:27:25,951
Before his friends
and family and Dr. Roz ...

946
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:28,152
So begins.
- Rozenstoun.

947
01:27:29,680 --> 01:27:31,511
Sorry, we tried
I.

948
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,238
This is not the same.

949
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:42,669
Certainly it is difficult.
- I'm glad to get it.

950
01:27:44,200 --> 01:27:49,274
I beat him up, and
tried everything to fix it.

951
01:27:49,760 --> 01:27:52,797
But considering everything,
I want something else to

952
01:27:53,800 --> 01:27:55,074
fix it now.

953
01:27:57,680 --> 01:28:01,070
Ronnie, you do not have.
- I.

954
01:28:02,440 --> 01:28:07,389
Nick's my best friend,
and they are doing this.

955
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:08,875
Tell the truth.

956
01:28:13,000 --> 01:28:17,596
When we were on
College and it was

957
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:19,035
before you
met, it was

958
01:28:19,400 --> 01:28:20,992
night that nothing has
mean, with drinks.

959
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:24,269
Go to the point.

960
01:28:25,040 --> 01:28:28,794
Before you
know, I slept

961
01:28:29,120 --> 01:28:30,314
from Geneva.

962
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:35,196
Friends tell the truth,
and I do it.

963
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:38,353
He wanted to tell you,
but I was

964
01:28:38,720 --> 01:28:39,948
fell in love with you,
did not want to hurt you.

965
01:28:40,400 --> 01:28:42,914
Asshole!
- In the circle alone.

966
01:28:43,880 --> 01:28:45,393
You are the worst.

967
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,996
I'm sorry.
- Do not touch me.

968
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,312
This is truest
thing, that you're sorry.

969
01:28:59,400 --> 01:29:00,719
Nick?

970
01:29:03,880 --> 01:29:09,557
I'm sorry, Ronnie.
It is not supposed to do that.

971
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:17,069
Beth, I am sorry that
I caused you pain.

972
01:29:23,000 --> 01:29:29,519
This was a great first
step. Revelation.

973
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,399
I'm fine, thanks.

974
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:50,158
I did not gamble,
I passed

975
01:29:50,560 --> 01:29:54,269
casinos, but I
gambled.

976
01:29:58,080 --> 01:30:00,674
Are you okay?

977
01:30:02,520 --> 01:30:04,795
It was a long day.

978
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:13,472
I never knew you
meals, if you're hungry.

979
01:30:31,960 --> 01:30:39,310
I do not know how to
I start, I was scared.

980
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:45,395
I'm sorry, I did not
feel safe.

981
01:30:46,440 --> 01:30:49,591
I have not told you to Vegas
and Kirn.

982
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:52,713
I became someone who
I do not want, and dressed up

983
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:59,428
all with the intervention,
and did not even gamble.

984
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:06,032
That's great, happy
I am about it, but it

985
01:31:06,360 --> 01:31:11,559
not good, not healthy.

986
01:31:12,520 --> 01:31:16,479
If you do not share the fact
such as that you were

987
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,759
from Geneva I am
darkness and to us

988
01:31:21,120 --> 01:31:23,236
reduced, we want to
be more.

989
01:31:24,200 --> 01:31:26,316
I understand that.

990
01:31:29,760 --> 01:31:31,796
I thought not
correctly you

991
01:31:32,160 --> 01:31:33,479
say something
I Niku.

992
01:31:33,920 --> 01:31:38,277
When I learned of
Vegas and that we

993
01:31:38,640 --> 01:31:45,034
not believed, was hurt.
I deserve it.

994
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:51,198
It is my job to do
respected.

995
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:55,190
I do not want more
ever go through

996
01:31:55,520 --> 01:31:56,794
something like this.

997
01:31:57,160 --> 01:32:02,393
Honestly, I love you.
- I love you.

998
01:32:06,720 --> 01:32:10,793
I understand.

999
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:19,439
Got a meeting with
Chrysler tomorrow.

1000
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:22,719
I do not know whether
Nik appear.

1001
01:32:23,040 --> 01:32:28,512
You did a bad friend, but
You do bad things.

1002
01:32:31,880 --> 01:32:34,155
But you care about.

1003
01:32:59,840 --> 01:33:03,958
Yes.

1004
01:33:33,720 --> 01:33:38,510
Ronnie Valentine, second
half of the team.

1005
01:33:38,920 --> 01:33:41,354
There will come to you.

1006
01:34:18,600 --> 01:34:21,672
How are you?

1007
01:34:23,480 --> 01:34:24,708
I moved out.

1008
01:34:27,840 --> 01:34:32,436
How are you feeling?
- Shaken.

1009
01:34:36,240 --> 01:34:41,394
I just kept
for something that was not there.

1010
01:34:42,920 --> 01:34:44,319
Not fair
to her.

1011
01:34:45,600 --> 01:34:49,070
I'm sorry about this.

1012
01:34:51,480 --> 01:34:59,239
I feel terrible,
and I felt sick.

1013
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:11,992
I am very razmi?Ijao
of friendship and it is ...

1014
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,917
That's it, good.
That's good.

1015
01:35:23,520 --> 01:35:27,149
I feel terrible,
and if you feel better.

1016
01:35:28,360 --> 01:35:31,238
I just want to move
through this, and if

1017
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:33,437
I want to re-
hit ...

1018
01:35:36,680 --> 01:35:38,113
God.

1019
01:35:40,600 --> 01:35:43,990
Everything is fine?
- Great.

1020
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:47,956
We are ready.
- Just a moment.

1021
01:35:49,840 --> 01:35:57,030
This is the presentation.
- I know where he is. We look forward to.

1022
01:36:01,600 --> 01:36:06,071
You did this horrible.
- I'm really sorry.

1023
01:36:09,160 --> 01:36:13,312
I know that I'm not much
out and when we

1024
01:36:13,600 --> 01:36:15,556
Geneva and I became
serious, you wanted

1025
01:36:16,120 --> 01:36:17,997
to hurt me and to
it was before.

1026
01:36:18,280 --> 01:36:22,398
I'm not saying that it was
easy, but in the future,

1027
01:36:22,760 --> 01:36:28,232
No matter how uncomfortable,
if it affects us,

1028
01:36:29,120 --> 01:36:33,955
You have to tell me.
Understand?

1029
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:39,400
I promise to get it.

1030
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:52,153
I'm fine.

1031
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:07,998
Sorry, in respect of the
what we saw ...

1032
01:37:09,120 --> 01:37:11,395
We are like kids
car too long, we are well.

1033
01:37:12,200 --> 01:37:14,350
Only we do.

1034
01:37:22,880 --> 01:37:26,509
The moment of truth has arrived.

1035
01:37:28,120 --> 01:37:31,271
On the way to here
any turbulence

1036
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:37,512
and confusion, but you
I wonder when

1037
01:37:37,840 --> 01:37:41,310
a move towards
something big

1038
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:43,069
it was not?

1039
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:44,668
I remember the people who
turned westward

1040
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:48,157
with dreams of gold and
occasion.

1041
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:55,113
Things became strange.

1042
01:37:58,200 --> 01:38:01,556
Cannibalism, people
are hungry.

1043
01:38:02,120 --> 01:38:03,269
Some families are
destroyed, but some

1044
01:38:03,600 --> 01:38:06,034
arrived at the West, not
May.

1045
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:12,276
They were not rich,
but we went

1046
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:15,319
to the west and this is our
destination.

1047
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:20,436
Nick, started the engine.

1048
01:38:45,080 --> 01:38:48,231
Son of a bitch.

1049
01:39:05,360 --> 01:39:07,999
I told you that
differences in Niku Brennan,

1050
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,998
and we have it.

1051
01:39:10,360 --> 01:39:14,956
Simply the best,
better than all others.

1052
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:19,558
You were right about
with these madmen.

1053
01:39:19,920 --> 01:39:21,239
Write a long-term contract
and write a check.

1054
01:39:21,760 --> 01:39:26,788
Because I love you.
So I am strong.

1055
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,679
They do not get it, but
I I get it.

1056
01:39:31,160 --> 01:39:32,878
All of these quarrels is a passion.

1057
01:39:33,400 --> 01:39:36,949
When doing so
close, you want to strangle someone.

1058
01:39:37,360 --> 01:39:38,429
I understand that.

1059
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:45,031
Engine on this car
when it started to vibrate.

1060
01:39:45,960 --> 01:39:49,669
I was on the hood
and how it vibrated.

1061
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:52,919
I understand you, when
I know you,

1062
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:59,358
I did not know what you are saying,
but I loved you.

1063
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:10,715
So, come on.

1064
01:40:13,480 --> 01:40:15,232
Can this, it must
be calm.

1065
01:40:15,600 --> 01:40:17,511
Nick Brennan, that's
second chance.

1066
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:20,992
If you succeed in the last
attempt, you

1067
01:40:21,320 --> 01:40:24,949
to win time for
two of the finale.

1068
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:27,193
Are you ready?
- You bet.

1069
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:28,509
Good luck.

1070
01:40:31,280 --> 01:40:36,115
The seats are occupied.
- Do not touch it you know the type.

1071
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:47,188
Nick, great moments are
are born from great thrower.

1072
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:53,595
It got tonight.

1073
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:58,951
One hit, if
ga?a? ten, maybe

1074
01:40:59,320 --> 01:41:06,351
miss nine, but
not this, not tonight.

1075
01:41:16,160 --> 01:41:19,232
Come on, great.

1076
01:41:37,320 --> 01:41:44,237
Congratulations Niko Brennan.
He won a trip for two.

1077
01:41:44,960 --> 01:41:47,428
You are!

1078
01:41:59,160 --> 01:42:01,515
Ronnie!

1079
01:42:23,800 --> 01:42:27,110
I knew you would succeed!
