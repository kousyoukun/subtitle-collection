THE DILEMMA (2011)

(BLUES MUSIC PLAYING)

3
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,830
RONNY: You've got to picture this.

4
00:01:20,914 --> 00:01:22,749
It was freshman year, there he is,

5
00:01:22,833 --> 00:01:27,420
completely naked, right outside the office!

6
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:29,839
RONNY: And he says, "Ronny told me to show up."

7
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,799
GENEVA: Hey, I have a question for the table.

8
00:01:31,884 --> 00:01:35,428
How long does it take to really know someone?

9
00:01:35,846 --> 00:01:38,055
BETH: I think you're continually
getting to know someone.

10
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:40,266
'Cause I think people change when they grow.

11
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,144
But I do think if you go through hell with someone,

12
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,772
then you get a pretty good sense
of how they handle stuff,

13
00:01:45,856 --> 00:01:47,315
which is important.

14
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,359
Come on, we're on the other side of that one.

15
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:52,945
I don't know.

16
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:56,699
I think you can know someone within
the first 10 seconds of seeing them.

17
00:01:56,867 --> 00:01:59,035
I mean, I fell in love with Geneva the second I saw her.

18
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:00,495
Aw...

19
00:02:00,579 --> 00:02:01,996
It's true. I did.

20
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:05,374
RONNY: Well, I don't know if you ever
really know someone entirely.

21
00:02:05,459 --> 00:02:06,959
And what is that supposed to mean? Yeah.

22
00:02:07,044 --> 00:02:10,296
Well, I mean, you know someone,
you think pretty good,

23
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,007
and then you find out stuff that's shocking
that you didn't know existed.

24
00:02:13,091 --> 00:02:14,217
I think that happens every day.

25
00:02:14,301 --> 00:02:16,969
Look at that show 20/20, it's always
the same thing, right?

26
00:02:17,054 --> 00:02:19,180
They're a couple, they're happy,
no one could believe it.

27
00:02:19,264 --> 00:02:20,389
There are a lot of these cases.

28
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,557
What about the guy with the crossbow?

29
00:02:21,642 --> 00:02:23,643
He buys a crossbow, he's practicing in the garage.

30
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,144
"By the way, bring me some lemonade.

31
00:02:25,229 --> 00:02:28,064
"Oh, my goodness, I had no idea you walked
through at that moment. Oops!"

32
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:30,483
Continue, please. Continue. BETH: That is gross!

33
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:33,402
But she forgives him. It was an
accident, and guess what?

34
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:36,364
Six months later, same accident. Yes, and it kills her.

35
00:02:36,615 --> 00:02:37,865
No! Yes!

36
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:38,991
(LAUGHS) No!

37
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,370
And, lookit, you hear all the time about these families

38
00:02:42,538 --> 00:02:44,747
that have entirely other families.

39
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,165
The dad, who knows what he does for a living,

40
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,667
he leaves to go to Connecticut.

41
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:50,002
But he was never going to Connecticut on business.

42
00:02:50,087 --> 00:02:52,213
He's really going to Harlem. He's
got a Puerto Rican family

43
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,506
that no one ever heard about. Yeah.

44
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,634
You think when he's watching the game, instead
of pretzels, he's eating Goya beans.

45
00:02:56,718 --> 00:02:58,052
Red flags, but they don't catch it.

46
00:02:58,136 --> 00:03:00,805
So my point is, you can really
think you know somebody,

47
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:03,599
and then it turns out that you don't
know everything about somebody.

48
00:03:03,684 --> 00:03:05,560
All right, Ronny. You still haven't
answered the question.

49
00:03:05,727 --> 00:03:07,436
No, I just did. You didn't.

50
00:03:07,688 --> 00:03:09,063
No, you didn't answer it. You're skirting it.

51
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,606
You're not answering straight up. Come on.

52
00:03:10,691 --> 00:03:13,317
You're bouncing around, you're doing
this, "Hey!" When you're doing this...

53
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:14,527
You do that a lot, by the way.

54
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,862
I think you're all special peoples.

55
00:03:15,946 --> 00:03:17,196
You're out of your mind!

56
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:19,115
And you're nothing of the sort.

57

(MAN ANNOUNCING ON PA)

60
00:03:38,302 --> 00:03:41,053
This is our shot. I need you to hug him.

61
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:43,347
I don't want to hug him.

62
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:45,558
Lookit, ever since he had a near-death experience,

63
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:48,728
he's become a very touchy-feely
guy, and he likes to be held.

64
00:03:48,812 --> 00:03:51,606
Look, you know I don't like touching
people I don't know very well, okay?

65
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,566
Or even people I do. So just...

66
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:56,319
Nick, do you want this thing or not?

67
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,362
Of course I do.

68
00:03:58,447 --> 00:03:59,655
Then feed the beast here!

69
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:03,743
This guy has a hot button, a point
of interest. His hot button is hugs.

70
00:04:03,827 --> 00:04:06,245
You hug him, you're gonna crack him wide open!

71
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,080
He's going to start feeling all bubbly inside.

72
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,332
Then he starts writing checks!

73
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:10,750
All right.

74
00:04:10,834 --> 00:04:13,085
I'm not asking you to go to an airport motel

75
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:15,212
and perform a trick on a Japanese businessman.

76
00:04:15,297 --> 00:04:19,091
I'm asking you to hug a senior executive
from General Motors, that's all!

77
00:04:19,176 --> 00:04:20,468
Now get your arms around him,

78
00:04:20,552 --> 00:04:22,637
and make him feel bubbly and warm!

79
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,101
I'll tell you what.

80
00:04:29,186 --> 00:04:33,940
Why don't you let Charles take you guys
over here and show you the entire line.

81
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:35,149
And it's great to have you here.

82
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:37,234
Thank you so much for coming. MAN: Thank you.

84
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:40,947
This puppy here reminds me of my first Dodge.

Uh-huh?

86
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,449
Remember that?

87
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:46,786

to be fun things to have, right?

They made a cool noise, they harnessed real power

90
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:53,626
and they made you feel like a badass

91
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,712
because you got to be the one right
there behind the wheel of it, right?

ECU modules a few years back.

Of course. Yeah.

00:05:17,401 --> 00:05:18,734
Of course.

You've got great days ahead of you, my friend.

102

You know, we actually have one idea
we're not committed to anyone on.

103
00:05:27,577 --> 00:05:28,995
We could run it by your team,

104
00:05:29,079 --> 00:05:30,955
and see if it's something that made sense for you.

105
00:05:31,415 --> 00:05:32,581
I'd love that.

106
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,208
Maybe we could get something on the books.

107
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,794
We'll come up there to Rock City,
to Detroit, and come see you.

108
00:05:39,423 --> 00:05:40,798
Okay. Yeah.

109
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,803
You lying bastard!

110
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,055
You are unbelievable. Did we get the meeting or not?

111

I'm hugging this man like I'm some kind of asshole...

112
00:05:50,017 --> 00:05:51,350
BETH: Now, why were you hugging the man?

113
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:52,977
Because he's our guy's direct competitor.

114
00:05:53,061 --> 00:05:55,187
Why would you hug the direct competitor?

115
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,564
Because he had a near-death experience.

116
00:05:56,648 --> 00:05:57,648
RONNY: Actually, no, he didn't.

117
00:05:58,608 --> 00:06:00,109

you mean, what am I doing?

120
00:06:03,947 --> 00:06:05,281
Did we get the meeting or what?

121
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,365
Come on, Nick.

122
00:06:06,450 --> 00:06:08,367
I'm never hugging again. I'm not listening to you.

123
00:06:08,452 --> 00:06:09,493
He sets me up!

124
00:06:09,578 --> 00:06:12,079
What do you expect me to do? Geneva, listen to me.

125
00:06:12,164 --> 00:06:13,622
You know him, he's way too honest.

126
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,249
If I fill him in on it, what happens?

127
00:06:15,417 --> 00:06:18,878
The sweating, he starts hyperventilating,
he passes out!

128

It was completely necessary.

130

we got the meeting.

I'm not gonna lie. Sometimes, I love your boyfriend.

132
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:32,850
You, I will hug. This is free. I'll hug you right back!

This is no charge! Come in here! My man!

Look at the great men throughout history,

143
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,957
none of them were dancers.

Abraham Lincoln? Not a big dancer.

Winston Churchill, he never tore up the dance floor.

Martin Luther King, he might've had
a dream, but he never danced to it.

great. I think they're the best.

he just called you his hero couple,

and yet he still refuses to dance with me.

00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:34,662
Ronny just told Beth I'm his hero. I'm your hero!

160
00:07:34,746 --> 00:07:36,163
You're the worst.

161
00:07:36,248 --> 00:07:38,874
Oh, come on. Every kid wants to dance with his hero!

162
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:40,376
Bring it up here!

163
00:07:40,544 --> 00:07:41,961
Let's do it.

164
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:56,767
Yo!

165
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,019
Blue! Set! Hut! Hut!

166
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:02,064
Go long, baby! Go long!

167
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,776
Yes!

168
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,861
Whoo-hoo!

169
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:19,623
My man.

170
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:23,419
That just happened. Oh, yeah.

171
00:08:23,628 --> 00:08:25,421
I don't think I'll ever forget that!

172
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,631
Oh, great. Is that burned in the hard drive now?

173
00:08:27,716 --> 00:08:29,091
Mmm-hmm. I think so.

174
00:08:34,556 --> 00:08:35,890
Excuse me.

175
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:38,601
Hey, I need to do this.

176
00:08:39,227 --> 00:08:40,936
Let me show you how this is done.

177
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,271
Be my guest.

178
00:08:47,319 --> 00:08:48,360
Come on, pal.

179
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:50,988
I think you're stuck with me.

180
00:08:53,909 --> 00:08:55,618
So when are you gonna ask her?

181
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:57,536
What?

182
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,330
Come on, Ronny!

183
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:01,332
You can see it all over her face!

184
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:06,045
You're never gonna find a girl as great as her.

185
00:09:06,129 --> 00:09:07,296
Let's be realistic.

186
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:10,049
Nick and I aren't making any new friends.

187
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,219
You've dated all my girlfriends.

188
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:15,262
You've batted through the whole lineup,

189
00:09:15,555 --> 00:09:18,474
and there's nothing left, you know?

190
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,517
Plus, we like her.

191
00:09:20,602 --> 00:09:22,978
Those other ones, we didn't even
like, and they're my friends!

192
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,148
Trust me.

193
00:09:27,192 --> 00:09:29,485
Pop the question or you're gonna lose her.

194
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,822
NICK: (LAUGHS) There you go! Hey, hey!

195
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,159
Special delivery! How's that for an entrance?

196
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:39,370
You were missed.

197
00:09:39,454 --> 00:09:40,829
I missed you, too.

198
00:09:46,503 --> 00:09:47,503
(CHUCKLES)

199
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,088
What? Nothing.

200
00:09:51,508 --> 00:09:52,800
Now I'm gonna turn up the heat.

201
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:55,803
What happens when the kitchen gets hot,
because I'm cooking something up, chef.

202
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,097
Don't play into my strength.

203
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,849
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

204
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:03,894
Whoo!

205
00:10:03,979 --> 00:10:05,562
Fifteen to four! (LAUGHS)

206
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:07,731
Really? You're gonna start... Now you're dancing?

207
00:10:07,816 --> 00:10:10,359
It's like I'm playing Floyd Mayweather
at Ping-Pong. That's ridiculous.

208
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,820
You're only supposed to do that if the game's over.

209
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:14,321
If the game's over. I'm just being happy, you know?

210
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,699
No, no, you're not being happy. This is a taunting.

211
00:10:16,825 --> 00:10:18,242
This is, like, taunting that's going on. I'm sorry.

212
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:19,743
You're not sorry, that's the problem.

213
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:20,828
I know. You're right.

214
00:10:20,912 --> 00:10:21,954
Okay, here's what we need to do now.

215
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:23,539
'Cause I think you're very spirited, and I like that.

216
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:26,625
I think we should turn it into
full-body-contact Ping-Pong.

217
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:27,793
(LAUGHS EXCITEDLY) Yes, we do!

218
00:10:28,086 --> 00:10:30,254
Come on, you can't taunt people bigger than you

219
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:32,172
and expect it just to be all fine.

220
00:10:32,257 --> 00:10:33,382
Help! (SCREAMS)

221
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:35,217
(LAUGHING)

222
00:10:35,802 --> 00:10:37,219
You're attacked. Yes! That's it.

223
00:10:37,304 --> 00:10:39,388
Are you gonna try and steal a kiss now?

224
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,140
Go on, I dare you.

225
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:51,734
I want to let you know, by the way,

226
00:10:51,818 --> 00:10:54,820
that I'm completely committed to this relationship.

227
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,363
I'm just re-upping. I'm already committed,

228
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:58,615
but I'm just re-upping my commitment
to this relationship

229
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,783
because I feel great.

230
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,577
How do you feel? Do you feel great?

231
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:02,661
Uh-huh.

232
00:11:02,746 --> 00:11:04,955
Yeah? Mmm-hmm. I feel great.

233
00:11:07,584 --> 00:11:09,293
(SLOW LOVE SONG PLAYING)

234
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,965
But is there a window?

235
00:11:15,508 --> 00:11:16,842
Are you anxious for this to go somewhere?

236
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:19,094
Ronny, Ronny, I know you.

237
00:11:19,179 --> 00:11:20,262
I know where you're headed with this.

238
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:23,724
Look, I don't need this to be something that it's not.

239
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:26,643
I don't want it to be something if
it's not, just to make me okay.

240
00:11:31,107 --> 00:11:32,691
But is there a clock that's ticking?

241
00:11:32,776 --> 00:11:35,319
Are you in a hurry to be heading somewhere?

242
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:38,739
There's always a clock. And I'm worrying, is it ticking,

243
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:40,491
getting to a point where the clock's gonna go off?

244
00:11:40,575 --> 00:11:42,659
Let's just talk through this, okay? Yeah.

245
00:11:43,286 --> 00:11:46,330
I have fun with you. I love being with you.

246
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:50,667
I think we've done a great job of getting
back to a really good place.

247
00:11:51,461 --> 00:11:53,212
I'm happy.

248
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:57,549
Now, if all of that rolls into something else,

249
00:11:57,634 --> 00:11:59,802
that can make me happy, too.

250
00:12:02,222 --> 00:12:06,016
I love you.

251
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:10,354
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)

252
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:16,360
Okay, Ronny. You can do this.

253
00:12:16,444 --> 00:12:17,903
This is your time to do it.

254
00:12:17,987 --> 00:12:19,738
You the man, Valentine. You're the man.

255
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,299
MALE STEWARD ON PA: Folks, this is our
final approach to Detroit's Metro Airport.

256
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,101
(EXHALES NERVOUSLY)

257
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,895
Hope this goes well.

258
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,071
Great moments are born from great opportunity.

259
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,366
And that's what you have here today, Nick.

260
00:13:04,451 --> 00:13:07,578
That's what you've earned here today!

261
00:13:07,704 --> 00:13:09,997
One meeting. (STAMMERS) Okay, what are you doing?

262
00:13:10,081 --> 00:13:11,290
You're giving me the... Really?

263
00:13:11,374 --> 00:13:13,417
The Kurt Russell speech from the movie Miracle?

264
00:13:13,501 --> 00:13:15,711
I just saw that five-year-old kid do
it on YouTube the other night,

265
00:13:15,795 --> 00:13:17,129
and I thought it was really inspirational.

266
00:13:17,213 --> 00:13:18,630
It's applicable to what we're doing.

267
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,175
Any time you go into a pressure situation,
a competition, it makes sense.

268
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:22,551
And I'm not gonna write something better than that.

269
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,761
Look at you, you're nervous.

270
00:13:25,388 --> 00:13:28,056
You're never nervous. Now, you're nervous.

271
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:31,852
Okay, here's the thing. I can't be
broke if I'm gonna get married.

272
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,604
Yeah?

273
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,648
Yes! See, I knew you would get here!

274
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,150
Okay, so here's my plan.

275
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:40,569
I'm gonna ask her next month, on her birthday.

276
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:42,654
Now, I worked out this great
deal from this Hasidic guy,

277
00:13:42,739 --> 00:13:44,156
who I met during Gamblers Anonymous.

278
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,493
He's literally gonna give me a $20,000 ring
for $10,000. Can you believe that?

279
00:13:47,577 --> 00:13:48,619
How are you doing that?

280
00:13:48,703 --> 00:13:49,661
Well, I'm gonna give him cash.

281
00:13:49,746 --> 00:13:52,498
And then I also said that you would help fix his car.

282
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:55,501
So those two little things are gonna
get me the deal with the Hasidic.

283
00:13:55,585 --> 00:13:57,336
Oh, I'm helping? I'm helping fix the car?

284
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,004
Well, you're the one who kept telling me to dive into it.

285
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,339
I thought you'd be excited to help. I'm sorry.

286
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,341
Okay, fine, but that is my gift to you.

287
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:04,468
Honestly, there'll be no fruit bowl from the registry.

288
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,594
That's it. That's what you're looking at.

289
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:06,720
You don't have to make a decision now.

290
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:08,013
On the day, see what's right...

291
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,474
No, I'm making... I can make the
decision now. I'm making it now.

292
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,017
I'm telling you right now, that is my gift.

293
00:14:12,393 --> 00:14:14,645
That's it. I'm fixing the car with the Hasidic guy.

294
00:14:14,729 --> 00:14:15,771
And make sure you tell Beth that, too.

295
00:14:15,897 --> 00:14:17,731
Seriously, I don't want it to be
uncomfortable. Let her know.

296
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,066
Whatever you wanna do on that day is your choice.

297
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,901
Okay. I'm doing it.

298
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,614
You take this meeting 10 times,
you might not get it nine.

299
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,533
All right, you got to stop that now.

300
00:14:27,617 --> 00:14:29,743
But not this meeting, Nick.

301
00:14:30,662 --> 00:14:32,079
Not today.

302
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:33,580
(EXHALES) You're really making me nervous.

303
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:36,625
Today, we are the greatest small business in the world.

304
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:40,420
I'm sick and tired of hearing about how
innovative these other boutiques are.

305
00:14:40,505 --> 00:14:43,674
This is our time. Their time is done!

306
00:14:43,967 --> 00:14:45,384
We're showing up in a cab.

307
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:57,271
NICK: Thanks for not mentioning that my
last three prototype bids got rejected.

308
00:14:57,355 --> 00:14:59,606
That's just a bad streak, pal.

309
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,067
You're gonna be great, I promise you.

310
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:03,151
(EXHALES)

311
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:14,288
Here you go.

312
00:15:15,206 --> 00:15:17,749
Ladies and gentlemen, electric cars,

313
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:20,168
they're totally gay.

314
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,962
It's true.

315
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,839
I don't mean that they're "homosexual" gay,

316
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:28,510
but I do mean "your parents were the
chaperone at the dance" gay. Right?

317
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,345
"You tuck it in and wear it real high" gay.

318
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,681
I don't wanna disrespect anybody,
'cause I'm not about that.

319
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,099
But I think we're understanding

320
00:15:34,183 --> 00:15:35,684
what we're trying to talk about here, right?

321
00:15:37,979 --> 00:15:40,814
I mean, honestly, the Nissan Spit? Really?

322
00:15:41,441 --> 00:15:42,691
It screams this.

323
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:47,529
Oh, here we go.

324
00:15:48,031 --> 00:15:50,699
The Hyundai Pomegranate. Right?

325
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,329
The Chevy Fingerprint.

326
00:15:57,624 --> 00:15:58,665
Now,

327
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:01,501
ah, look at this.

328
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:08,383
The 1966 Ford GT350.

329
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:12,054
You wanna roll up in that one, hoss?

330
00:16:12,805 --> 00:16:17,392
The 1965 Pontiac GTO.

331
00:16:17,727 --> 00:16:19,645
Completely awesome.

332
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:24,358
The 1970 Hemi Cuda

333
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:28,445
took more virginities than Francis Albert Sinatra.

334
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,489
What are we suggesting here?

335
00:16:30,573 --> 00:16:34,159
We're talking about taking the benefits
of electric transportation,

336
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:37,496
but combine them with the rock and roll-ness

337
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:42,125
and the sexiness that the Dodge
current muscle-car models have.

338
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,795
Nicholas?

339
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,924
We believe we could produce the technology

340
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,511
to incorporate an electronic motor
in your current models.

341
00:16:53,638 --> 00:16:56,723
But with the aggressive sound character,

342
00:16:57,225 --> 00:16:59,768
the exhilarating vibration character,

343
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,771
the complete visceral experience

344
00:17:03,189 --> 00:17:07,984
that we've all grown to know and love in
the Dodge Challenger and Charger lines.

345
00:17:08,361 --> 00:17:11,113
SUSAN: Guys, we love our current electric models.

346
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:14,282
That said, we also agree there's a
market for what you're pitching.

347
00:17:14,826 --> 00:17:18,787
But, if you're asking Dodge to invest
in your pursuit of this concept,

348
00:17:19,247 --> 00:17:21,456
what do you have that we don't?

349
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,502

(BREATHES NERVOUSLY)

351
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,425
So let's forget the up-front money.

352
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:34,136
Let's deal with it in success because that's
exactly what we're gonna have.

353
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,556
I want 900,000, you want 400,000.

354
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:40,892
We don't need to get a Chinese auction where
I go, "850." You go, "450," right?

355
00:17:40,977 --> 00:17:42,060
"Eight." "Five."

356
00:17:42,145 --> 00:17:45,605
Let's just cut it right down the middle
at 775, and close this thing.

357
00:17:46,399 --> 00:17:47,649
(LAUGHS)

358
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,445
I appreciate your spirit, Mr. Valentine.

359
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:53,613
But we're taking all the risk,

360
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,699
so we'll stick with the 400,000.

361
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,493
And I think you need to focus
on the bigger picture, here.

362
00:17:58,995 --> 00:18:01,621
With success and a good working relationship,

363
00:18:01,706 --> 00:18:05,584
we're prepared to offer you an overall
deal, which means up-front money

364
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,629
and an option for an exclusive long-term
contract with your company.

365
00:18:09,714 --> 00:18:13,216
And with that deal, you gentlemen
won't be disappointed.

366
00:18:14,135 --> 00:18:16,720
You made a great decision today, Tom.

367
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:18,972
Thank you. Thank you.

She's from the outside, but we've
had great experience with her.

370
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,859
SUSAN: You know, I was at Ford
until about five months ago.

371
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:33,195
They're still talking about you guys over there.

372
00:18:33,279 --> 00:18:35,614
They said you could whittle down a supplier

373
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,408
to less than 15 cents on the dollar just by talking.

374
00:18:38,493 --> 00:18:42,829
And you were like a mad scientist that
wouldn't leave the lab for days.

375
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:44,706
Well, boys,

00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,542
it takes one to know one.

too fast, just a little too soon.

not even in the red zone?

know, they're gonna laugh at us.

because I had to go... These kids lost their ball,

they can't go get their own ball.

Well, to their credit, these little porkers were trying,

and they say, "Hey, can you
help me with the ball here?"

00:31:08,242 --> 00:31:11,285
I want to talk to you about something
that's kind of personal.

631
00:31:11,370 --> 00:31:13,204
Something that doesn't have to do with any of this.

632
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:16,249
Do you mind just stepping up with
me in the office real quick?

633
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,417
You want to go to the office, talk
about something personal

634
00:31:18,502 --> 00:31:20,461
that doesn't have to do with this?

635
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:21,587
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

636
00:31:21,838 --> 00:31:23,381
You know, I'm bleeding inside.

637
00:31:23,465 --> 00:31:26,842
There's blood where it shouldn't be in
my body, out of (STAMMERS) things.

638
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,554
I've thrown up four times in the last two days,

639
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:31,806
which doesn't make any sense, because
I haven't eaten in three.

640
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,391
So I don't even know where it's coming from!

641
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:34,600
Hey, listen, I understand what you're saying...

642
00:31:34,685 --> 00:31:37,436
You're not in the pressure cooker, man! You're not!

643
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:39,730
When I said I was on the 25-yard line, I'm not.

644
00:31:39,815 --> 00:31:42,108
I'm much further back than that.

645
00:31:42,192 --> 00:31:45,069
We are deep in our own end zone.
Right back there, yeah.

646
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:46,487
And I'm flushed out of the pocket,

647
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:47,738
and the defense is coming for me,

648
00:31:47,823 --> 00:31:50,408
and they're big, man! They're fast!

649
00:31:50,492 --> 00:31:53,995
Ah! They're coming! And I turn
to you, my lead blocker.

650
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,454
You turn to me, "Hey.

651
00:31:55,539 --> 00:32:00,126
"You want to go upstairs and talk in the
office about something personal?"

652
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,335
Just block!

653
00:32:01,587 --> 00:32:04,505
That's what I need you to do, is just block!

654
00:32:05,591 --> 00:32:08,217
And do me a favor, would you
sign the damn loan forms?

655
00:32:08,302 --> 00:32:10,469
So I have somebody to fund my failure?

656
00:32:10,846 --> 00:32:14,640
Unless you just want to kiss that
long-term contract goodbye.

657
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,648
(SIGHING)

658
00:32:25,652 --> 00:32:26,986
Unbelievable, huh?

659
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,071
The Bulls? I know, it's ridiculous.

660
00:32:29,156 --> 00:32:30,740
I mean, Rose should've passed to Noah.

661
00:32:30,824 --> 00:32:32,783
He was wide open, completely unguarded.

662
00:32:32,868 --> 00:32:35,036
I know, man, they just can't get it together at all.

663
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,997
Yeah. I mean, if you ask me, Rose doesn't trust Noah.

664
00:32:38,081 --> 00:32:40,666
They're teammates. He doesn't trust
he can hit the winning shot.

665
00:32:40,751 --> 00:32:42,126
Sucks, man.

666
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:46,047
Yeah, because trust really runs deep on a team.

667
00:32:46,131 --> 00:32:48,257
You got to be able to trust your teammate.

668
00:32:48,383 --> 00:32:51,469
Do you think that you have to be able to trust
your teammate off the court as well?

669
00:32:51,928 --> 00:32:53,721
Uh... Sure. Let's just say,

670
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:55,681
and I'm talking completely hypothetically here,

671
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:59,143
let's say that Noah finds out that
Derek Rose's girl is cheating.

672
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,269
Does he tell him or not?

673
00:33:00,354 --> 00:33:01,937
Because he doesn't want to affect his performance.

674
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,649
Yeah. I mean, he's... No, no.

675
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:05,733
Yeah, you tell him. No.

676
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,152
It's toxic to keep all that in. You have to tell him.

677
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,363
That's Guy Code. You're talking about your best friend.

678
00:33:10,447 --> 00:33:12,990
You ever hear the expression, "Kill
the messenger"? 'Cause, I mean...

679
00:33:13,075 --> 00:33:14,659
Yeah, but I don't think it applies here at all.

680
00:33:14,743 --> 00:33:17,328
I mean, if you don't tell your friend, your best friend,

681
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:18,996
then you're basically banging her, too.

682
00:33:19,081 --> 00:33:22,375
Okay, come on, now. It depends. Is it the playoffs?

683
00:33:23,210 --> 00:33:24,752
Game seven, the championship.

684
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,337
Championship.

685
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:27,505
No, then I wouldn't tell him.

686
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:28,798
Yeah, no way. No.

687
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,884
Don't tell him. Nope. You wait. You wait.

688
00:33:32,427 --> 00:33:34,261
RONNY: Hey, sis. Just checking in.

689
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:36,597
DIANE: Ronny, you never call to just "check in."

690
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,433
You know what happened? I saw
this episode of Springer,

691
00:33:39,768 --> 00:33:42,395
and I just can't shake what happened on the episode.

692
00:33:42,479 --> 00:33:45,815
This woman found out that her best friend's
husband was cheating on her,

693
00:33:45,899 --> 00:33:47,483
and she did not tell her friend.

694
00:33:47,693 --> 00:33:49,110
Ronny, why are you telling me this?

695
00:33:49,444 --> 00:33:50,528
Bowling.

696
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,238
I just want to get your take on it. What do you think?

697
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,156
Do you think she should have told her best friend

698
00:33:54,241 --> 00:33:55,324
that her husband was cheating?

699
00:33:55,409 --> 00:33:57,034
Of course she should.

700
00:33:57,119 --> 00:33:58,744
But what about the whole "kill the messenger" thing?

701
00:33:58,787 --> 00:34:01,038
You know what I mean? Ronny,
she is doing her friend a favor.

702
00:34:01,123 --> 00:34:03,916
It doesn't matter how painful the moment...

703
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:06,669
Mom, come on! Okay, Ronny, I got to go, I'm sorry.

704
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:07,962
Okay. Bye-bye.

00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:17,638
Hello?

707
00:34:17,931 --> 00:34:19,348
Nice disguise, Ronny.

You want to tell me Saul's cheating on me? Just say it!

712
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:28,733
Diane, listen. I don't think you understand

713
00:34:28,817 --> 00:34:30,151
what I'm saying. I'm not saying anything about Saul.

714
00:34:30,277 --> 00:34:32,153
I'm gonna kill him! You don't need to kill anybody.

715

I really thought I was done with choosing
men who were basically Dad.

I mean, who would even sleep
with that out-of-work slob?

00:34:40,162 --> 00:34:42,663
Okay, Diane, listen to me, you're way overreacting.

How dare you tell me something
like this over the phone?

How dare you tell me this at all?

Can I talk to you for a second?

I am so sorry.

737
00:35:44,601 --> 00:35:46,393
I've been thinking too much about myself lately,

738
00:35:46,478 --> 00:35:49,772
and I'm throwing tantrums because
a car is not loud enough.

Eight minutes? Yeah.

00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,449
Yeah, I have a call at 5:00, with

He's going to give me some pointers
on throttle response.

Hi, Nick. Hi, sweetie.

Yeah,

774
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:36,670
but I don't have time for a night,
honey. We're way behind.

Well, you're behind because you
guys are burning yourselves out.

You got to recharge the engine, get some perspective.

I don't think we have the time for perspective.

I don't know that tonight's a good
night for us to go do anything.

I know you don't want to celebrate,

780
00:37:50,143 --> 00:37:51,435
because you guys haven't gotten a line yet.

781
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,770
So it's not a celebration.

782
00:37:52,854 --> 00:37:54,521
We're just thinking maybe we could take a breather

783

to set the table for a possible potential celebration

941
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:06,161
You get your ice cream.

942
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:09,414
And you know what? 99 % of the time, you're
gonna end up at the ice cream shop

943
00:45:09,499 --> 00:45:12,125
with a big hot fudge sundae. Nuts!

944
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:18,799
Only one percent of the time do you kill the innocent.

945
00:45:20,301 --> 00:45:21,760
It's pretty good odds.

946
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,388
I'm not understanding what you're trying to say to me.

947
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,765
All right, Ronny.

948
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:31,770
Tomorrow night is Beth's parents' anniversary party.

949
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,896
Forty years.

950
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:36,108
I really think you can learn something from it.

951
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,442
I want you to soak it in.

952
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:45,867
Oh, and, by the way, we did
just move into the red zone.

953
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,010
Hey, Felix, the algorithm is solid,

954
00:46:04,095 --> 00:46:05,637
so it's got to be the hardware, right?

955
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:07,180
Yeah, looks like it.

956
00:46:07,265 --> 00:46:08,473
Yeah, well, keep at it.

957
00:46:08,558 --> 00:46:10,600
Okay. I got it, I'm on it.

958
00:46:14,856 --> 00:46:17,190
Do you want to kiss Felix? Come in.

959
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:19,776
Come here. Don't be shy, baby.

960
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:22,863
You can join us. Yeah.

961
00:46:23,948 --> 00:46:25,574
Good night, guys.

962
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:51,141
I'm sorry, I don't mean to make
you feel uncomfortable.

963
00:46:51,225 --> 00:46:53,185
(STAMMERS) I'm not a pervert or anything, I'm sorry.

964
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:55,228
That's too bad.

965
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:56,855
I'm sorry?

966
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:58,982
I said, that's too bad.

967
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:03,695
Right.

(GROANS)

970
00:47:25,593 --> 00:47:27,802
Yo. RONNY: Hey, I just wanted to call

971
00:47:27,887 --> 00:47:31,181
and say thanks for your support
today. I really appreciate it.

972
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,599
(STAMMERS) No problem.

973
00:47:34,769 --> 00:47:36,686
So, what are you doing?

974
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:39,272
I'm just at home.

975
00:47:39,524 --> 00:47:40,524
Home?

976
00:47:40,608 --> 00:47:42,025
Yes, I'm at home.

977
00:47:42,610 --> 00:47:45,237
Yeah? You want to get a beer?

978
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:49,616
You know what? I can't. Mad Men
marathon with Geneva tonight.

979
00:47:50,117 --> 00:47:53,036
You're right, I really... I got to shut
down the engine sometimes.

980
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,120
Why you looking in?

981
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:56,957
No peep Tom. Yes.

982
00:47:57,375 --> 00:47:59,251
You come in or you go! I'm going to go.

983
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,211
Go. No, I have things.

984
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:03,004
You go. And you go, too.

985
00:48:03,506 --> 00:48:04,839
Who was that? It's a traffic cop.

986
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,675
They've shut down North Avenue.

987
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:08,301
They're shutting stuff down, there's too many people.

988
00:48:08,386 --> 00:48:10,387
Hold on, this guy is a prick. I'm not even driving!

989
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:12,430
I'm walking around here, I'm a citizen!

990

Mr. Mountain High!

991
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,100
Hold on. Hey.

992
00:48:15,268 --> 00:48:16,810
We make you so happy!

When you leave here, you will smile like boy

who just got off braces, big and proud!

995

Boon-me is back in country, and looks
very forward to seeing you.

00:48:27,238 --> 00:48:28,613
Yeah, look, I got to go.

997
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:30,073
What was that?

998
00:48:30,157 --> 00:48:32,200
Nothing, there's a war film on bef ore Mad Men.

999
00:48:32,285 --> 00:48:33,702
Listen, I'm going to go. I'll call you.

1000
00:48:33,786 --> 00:48:34,953
RONNY: Buddy, just so you know,

1001
00:48:35,037 --> 00:48:37,205
if you ever want to talk about anything, just like...

1002
00:48:37,290 --> 00:48:38,415
There's nothing we can't talk about.

1003
00:48:38,499 --> 00:48:39,499
Yeah, we can always talk.

1004
00:48:39,584 --> 00:48:41,751
I thought tonight could be good, 'cause
maybe we could get a drink.

1005
00:48:41,836 --> 00:48:43,670
NICK: All right, I got to run. Boon-me is waiting.

1006
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:57,225
I just... I wanted to call and let you know

1007
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,228
that I've been thinking about what you were saying

1008
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:02,105
with the curtain and all that stuff.

1009
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:05,066
And I just want to make sure that
I'm being fair to you during this,

1010
00:49:05,151 --> 00:49:08,653
and that I do realize that there's probably
two sides to every story.

1011
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:10,572
Oh, Jesus Christ!

1012
00:49:10,656 --> 00:49:13,033
Ronny, you followed him to the massage parlor?

1013
00:49:13,284 --> 00:49:16,036
(STAMMERS) Well, no, I just wanted
to call and let you know

1014
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,163
that I'm sure that not everything
that you're saying is bullshit.

1015
00:49:18,247 --> 00:49:20,165
And that if there is complicated things

1016
00:49:20,291 --> 00:49:23,376
that are going on, I really hope you guys work on it.

1017
00:49:24,712 --> 00:49:27,672
And just so you know, I really don't
want to be in this, Geneva.

1018
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:28,798
I know.

1019
00:49:28,883 --> 00:49:30,967
It's your shot, come on!

1020
00:49:31,636 --> 00:49:33,136
Wait, who was that? Where are you?

1021
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,804
I'm at home.

1022
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,307
Except it's your shot, Geneva,

1023
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,559
and you don't own a fucking pool table!

1024
00:49:39,644 --> 00:49:40,935
Ronny, I got to go.

1025
00:49:41,020 --> 00:49:44,064
What happened to, "I'm not gonna see this
guy anymore until after I talk to Nick"?

1026
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,315
Good night, Ronny.

1027
00:49:45,399 --> 00:49:47,567
Yeah, good night, princess. Just
make sure you're ready

1028
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,778
to talk to your husband when
you go home tonight, honey.

1029
00:49:49,862 --> 00:49:51,738
Because I'm definitely going to talk to him!

1030
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,823
Okay, just take a breath.

1031

(SIGHS)

1032
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:58,370
Besides, I have something you might want
to hear before you go and do that.

1033
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,016
What is it?

1034
00:50:20,101 --> 00:50:21,476
I ordered you some coffee.

1035
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,019
I don't need your goddamn coffee, Geneva,

1036
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:24,729
I don't have anything to talk to you about.

1037
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:27,023
I'm gonna go see Nick tonight,

1038
00:50:27,108 --> 00:50:30,860
and I'm going to tell him that
his wife is sick and twisted,

1039
00:50:31,654 --> 00:50:33,530
and that she's a liar.

1040
00:50:33,989 --> 00:50:36,950
And I'm going to tell him that he's
married to goddamn Helen Keller.

1041
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:40,453
Helen Keller? Yeah.

1042
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:41,913
The girl with all the personalities.

1043
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,081
Sybil.

1044
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,708
Yeah, Sybil.

1045
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,419
Who are you today, Blanche?
How deep do the waters run?

1046
00:50:47,503 --> 00:50:50,588
You're a five-year-old on a playground, Ronald.

1047
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:53,133
It's not like I want to go and see Zip.

1048
00:50:53,259 --> 00:50:57,303
But when my husband calls me to explain
he has another late meeting,

1049
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,139
it kind of just flies out the window.

1050
00:50:59,223 --> 00:51:01,808
"Zip"? That's the guy's name, Zip?

1051
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,562
The point is, Ronny, I don't want any of this.

1052
00:51:05,646 --> 00:51:06,855
I love my husband.

1053
00:51:06,939 --> 00:51:08,356
You got a real funny way of showing that.

1054
00:51:08,441 --> 00:51:09,733
Stay out of my life.

1055
00:51:09,817 --> 00:51:11,401
You're not a therapist.

1056
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,653
In fact, you need one, desperately.

1057
00:51:14,405 --> 00:51:17,574
Look in the mirror. You're 40 years
old, you've never been married.

1058
00:51:17,658 --> 00:51:19,534
Go fix yourself and then you can call me.

1059
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:20,618
I don't need to call you, I don't need

1060
00:51:20,703 --> 00:51:21,745
to say anything to you anymore.

1061
00:51:21,829 --> 00:51:24,831
All I need to do is get out of here and
go tell Nick that his wife is cheating.

1062
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,417
And I guess, because you weren't able to do

1063
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:30,086
the things that you really said you needed to do

1064
00:51:30,171 --> 00:51:32,922
that that's just the way it's going
to have to go down, honey.

1065
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:36,092
You know what? I see it going down
just a little bit differently.

1066
00:51:36,177 --> 00:51:37,677
Really? Yeah.

1067
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:40,388
Because I'm going to deny it.

1068
00:51:40,473 --> 00:51:42,599
And then I'm going to say you made a pass at me.

1069
00:51:42,683 --> 00:51:44,517
I made a pass at you? Yep.

1070
00:51:45,603 --> 00:51:48,521
And considering our little secret,

1071
00:51:48,606 --> 00:51:50,356
I'm pretty sure he'll believe me.

1072
00:51:50,858 --> 00:51:52,859
Geneva, okay...

1073
00:51:55,529 --> 00:51:57,697
We both decided not to say anything

1074
00:51:57,782 --> 00:52:01,075
because you liked him, and we didn't
want to ruin something good

1075
00:52:01,160 --> 00:52:02,577
over a drunken college night

1076
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:05,872
that happened three months before
you two ever started dating.

1077
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,333
But, Ronny, he doesn't know that.

1078
00:52:08,793 --> 00:52:10,835
It didn't mean anything, Geneva.

1079
00:52:11,212 --> 00:52:14,172
Yeah? Well, it means something now, doesn't it?

1080
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:18,802
See, you need to understand how
this is going to play out, Ronny.

1081
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:22,222
I'm going tell him how we slept
together all those years ago,

1082
00:52:22,306 --> 00:52:25,517
and then I'm going to say that you
started making passes at me.

1083
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,561
And that they never stopped.

1084
00:52:30,189 --> 00:52:31,481
You do that.

1085
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:35,568
You sell him that I've been hitting
on you for 20 years straight.

1086

(SOBBING)

1087
00:52:39,406 --> 00:52:43,743
I should've told you, Nick, I should've told you sooner.

1088
00:52:45,412 --> 00:52:48,998
But Ronny insisted that we not say anything.

1089
00:52:49,083 --> 00:52:52,418
But as the years went on, it got harder and harder

1090
00:52:52,503 --> 00:52:56,422
and I just lied to myself and said it didn't matter.

1091
00:52:57,258 --> 00:52:58,633
(SNIFFLING)

1092
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:03,179
But I'm telling you this now because
Ronny has gone crazy!

1093
00:53:04,098 --> 00:53:07,141
He's been throwing me up against restaurant walls

1094

1413
01:12:56,956 --> 01:12:59,374
People make mistakes in life.

1414
01:12:59,459 --> 01:13:01,376
But I would assume

1415
01:13:01,461 --> 01:13:06,339
what would get you through those 40 years would be...

1416
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:08,508
...honesty.

1417
01:13:10,011 --> 01:13:13,847
Honesty and honesty alone.

1418
01:13:14,307 --> 01:13:16,141
And love.

1419
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:19,853
But even more than that, Burt, is the honesty.

1420
01:13:20,813 --> 01:13:22,647
SUE: Don't forget about patience.

1421
01:13:22,815 --> 01:13:25,734
Oh, no one's going to forget about patience, Sue.

1422
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:27,736
You can relax, patience is on the table.

1423
01:13:27,820 --> 01:13:30,489
(CHUCKLES) What I'm talking about,
though, is honesty here.

1424
01:13:31,491 --> 01:13:33,533
Talking about two people

1425
01:13:34,827 --> 01:13:37,245
who have probably had an eye
wander every now and then.

1426
01:13:37,872 --> 01:13:39,748
Everyone knows Burt was in the garment business.

1427
01:13:39,832 --> 01:13:41,792
If you don't think you meet a
lot of girls in that business,

1428
01:13:41,876 --> 01:13:43,460
then you don't get out of the house much.

1429
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:45,128
A lot of girls.

1430
01:13:45,213 --> 01:13:46,505
A lot.

1431
01:13:46,881 --> 01:13:48,840
Good-looking guy, well-spoken.

1432
01:13:49,383 --> 01:13:51,760
It's "pinch me, I'm dreaming time," am I right, ladies?

1433
01:13:51,844 --> 01:13:55,764
And look at Sue. Gorgeous lady, easy to be around.

1434
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:57,933
Always into the aerobics.

1435
01:13:58,017 --> 01:14:00,102
Kept it tight, in a great way.

1436
01:14:01,062 --> 01:14:04,106
And Burt did well, they have
a pool. Pool guy come over.

1437
01:14:04,190 --> 01:14:06,316
Lot of guys would come over to
the house. Young guys, too.

1438
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,943
Now let's say something did happen.

1439
01:14:08,027 --> 01:14:09,486
We don't know that it did, maybe it didn't.

1440
01:14:09,570 --> 01:14:11,279
But it's not up to us to know, it's up to them to know.

1441
01:14:11,364 --> 01:14:12,656
I bet they were honest with each other.

1442
01:14:12,740 --> 01:14:14,783
I bet she came to him and said, "Hey, Burt,

1443
01:14:14,867 --> 01:14:15,951
"you know you're my number one.

1444
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,496
"But maybe Mama got thirsty last night."

1445
01:14:19,872 --> 01:14:21,039
(GASPS)

1446
01:14:21,541 --> 01:14:25,085
What I'm going to focus on, though,
here is the ingredient

1447
01:14:25,169 --> 01:14:29,256
that I think really makes the whole stew
stick together, and that is honesty.

1448
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:32,050
And similar interests!

1449
01:14:32,510 --> 01:14:33,802
Who are you?

1450
01:14:34,554 --> 01:14:36,054
I'm Cousin Betty.

1451
01:14:36,514 --> 01:14:37,556
First?

1452
01:14:38,224 --> 01:14:39,349
Second.

1453
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:43,228
Okay, Cousin Betty, this is not a group toast

1454
01:14:43,312 --> 01:14:44,688
nor is it an open forum.

1455
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:46,022
I'm the one who's standing up here.

1456
01:14:46,107 --> 01:14:48,108
I'm the one with the glass, I'm the one that is talking.

1457
01:14:48,192 --> 01:14:49,609
Now, Burt and Sue chime in

1458
01:14:49,694 --> 01:14:52,946
and that's fine because it's their night,
you know, 40 years and all of that.

1459
01:14:53,030 --> 01:14:54,072
But not you.

1460
01:14:55,449 --> 01:14:57,325
Nobody gave you a speaking part, nobody cares.

1461
01:14:58,911 --> 01:15:01,997
You're a second cousin, which isn't even a real relative

1462
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,082
because someone could have sex with a second cousin

1463
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:05,458
and the kid could still be normal.

1464
01:15:10,131 --> 01:15:12,299
Honesty.

1465
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:16,094
You cannot run from it.

1466
01:15:17,471 --> 01:15:18,555
And believe me,

1467
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:22,475
it'll find you.

1468
01:15:22,560 --> 01:15:27,856
The truth will always find you.

1469
01:15:31,903 --> 01:15:33,945
Burt and Sue.

1470
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,947
Forty years, being honest.

1471
01:15:36,032 --> 01:15:37,908
ALL: Burt and Sue.

1472
01:15:38,284 --> 01:15:39,451
Congratulations.

1473
01:15:41,329 --> 01:15:43,038
(WHISPERS) Can I speak to you in the kitchen?

1474
01:15:43,164 --> 01:15:44,873
I was just going to finish my... Please?

1475
01:15:44,957 --> 01:15:47,042
Sure. Okay.

1476
01:16:01,515 --> 01:16:03,058
I need to know what's going on.

1477
01:16:03,142 --> 01:16:04,309
Nothing.

1478
01:16:04,393 --> 01:16:06,311
I'm just toasting, and I'm passionate about honesty.

1479
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:09,147
I'm not talking about the inappropriate toast

1480
01:16:09,232 --> 01:16:11,107
that you just gave at my parents' anniversary,

1481
01:16:11,192 --> 01:16:12,317
or the bar fight,

1482
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:16,363
or the allergies that you caught from
street plants while chasing fat kids.

1483
01:16:16,447 --> 01:16:17,697
I'm talking about

1484
01:16:17,782 --> 01:16:20,575
what's going on in your head
that's causing these things.

1485
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:26,289
It's just some stuff that I have to fix.

1486
01:16:26,374 --> 01:16:28,667
That's it, honey. And I can't bring you in on it

1487
01:16:28,751 --> 01:16:32,295
because that would directly affect my ability to do that.

1488
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:34,047
To do what? To fix it!

1489
01:16:34,131 --> 01:16:35,715
Fix it, fix it!

1490
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:37,592
I have to fix it on my own, honey.

1491
01:16:37,677 --> 01:16:41,304
Okay, Ronny, you're not fixing anything

1492
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:42,931
and you're breaking more stuff.

1493
01:16:43,724 --> 01:16:46,059
And it's enough!

1494
01:16:46,477 --> 01:16:48,812
You just gave a whole speech about honesty,

1495
01:16:48,896 --> 01:16:51,064
it's time for you to be honest with me!

1496
01:16:51,357 --> 01:16:52,983
Is it? Yeah.

1497
01:16:53,067 --> 01:16:54,526
Is it honest time now, between us?

1498
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,112
Then why don't you start, Beth?

1499
01:16:57,196 --> 01:16:59,322
Why don't you tell me about the Kearny Group?

1500
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:01,992
(NERVOUS CHUCKLING EXHALE)

1501
01:17:02,076 --> 01:17:03,743
How do you know about the Kearny Group?

1502
01:17:03,828 --> 01:17:05,328
Are you going to Las Vegas?

1503
01:17:06,038 --> 01:17:07,372
Are you planning on leaving me?

1504
01:17:07,456 --> 01:17:10,667
God, Ronny, no! No!

1505
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:17,924
They asked me to open up a restaurant
in City Center, and I said no.

1506
01:17:18,009 --> 01:17:19,551
Why?

1507
01:17:20,845 --> 01:17:23,263
Because that would mean I'd have to go live

1508
01:17:23,347 --> 01:17:25,265
in Las Vegas for a couple of years.

1509
01:17:26,100 --> 01:17:27,600
And...

1510
01:17:30,021 --> 01:17:31,813
And what, Beth?

1511
01:17:34,859 --> 01:17:38,737
And I don't trust you in Las Vegas.

1512
01:17:39,947 --> 01:17:41,197
Okay.

1513
01:17:43,534 --> 01:17:45,035
Ronny...

1514
01:17:46,037 --> 01:17:47,287
Look at you.

1515
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:49,748
Your sponsor called me.

1516
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:51,750
You haven't been going to your meetings,

1517
01:17:51,834 --> 01:17:54,794
you're walking around with large amounts of cash,

1518
01:17:54,879 --> 01:17:58,381
and it just really feels like two years ago.

1519
01:17:58,466 --> 01:18:00,008
You know, I...

1520
01:18:02,053 --> 01:18:03,803
I can't get into this with you right now.

1521
01:18:03,888 --> 01:18:07,599
If you don't let me in, how do I know what to do?

1522
01:18:07,683 --> 01:18:08,975
How can I help you?

1523
01:18:09,226 --> 01:18:11,603
I think it's best if I go.

1524
01:18:12,271 --> 01:18:14,105
I don't want you to go.

1525
01:18:21,155 --> 01:18:23,198
I'm going to go sleep at the office tonight.

1526
01:18:24,367 --> 01:18:25,825

Please, give me a minute, I don't know where I'm at.

Oh, God. Hey, man. What's going on?

1535
01:19:22,967 --> 01:19:24,217
Come on in the house.

1536

What, are you going to shoot me right here

1537
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:26,469
on your porch in broad daylight?

1538
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:27,679
Are you out of your mind?

1539
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,222
No, not if you're in the house.

1540
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:30,932
I've googled this.

1541
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:33,977
Do you want to know how it works? Yeah?

1542
01:19:34,061 --> 01:19:36,104
You come inside and I defend myself.

1543
01:19:36,188 --> 01:19:38,064
Now, I'm not going to pump six bullets into you.

1544
01:19:38,149 --> 01:19:41,151
No, that would make me look crazy and out of control.

1545
01:19:41,235 --> 01:19:44,779
No, I'm going to pump three into you
like a calm gun-owner would.

1546
01:19:44,864 --> 01:19:48,074
Zip, I came here with the intent, and only the intent,

1547
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,659
of getting my camera back.

1548
01:19:50,244 --> 01:19:53,246
(STUTTERS) Oh, yeah. Your camera?

1549
01:19:54,081 --> 01:19:56,082
Come on inside.

completely nuts the other night.

You killed my fish, man. I know.

01:20:13,893 --> 01:20:15,143
Why would you do that?

1559
01:20:15,227 --> 01:20:16,978
Maybe you should be compensated for that.

1560

You should be compensated for that.

1561

I can't put a price on that, because that's a friend.

Although you can't pet it, but what would the fish do?

The fish doesn't want this, man.

1564

I think what the fish is saying is maybe
I should get my camera back.

01:20:40,586 --> 01:20:43,421
I have a thousand. I'll give you the thousand.

1571
01:20:44,590 --> 01:20:45,882
And an apology.

1572
01:20:45,966 --> 01:20:50,303
Zip, if I apologize to you when you
have a gun pointed at my throat,

1573
01:20:50,387 --> 01:20:52,764
then I don't think it really counts. (CHUCKLES)

1574
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:55,308
That's a good point.

1575
01:20:56,310 --> 01:20:59,521
I'm sorry for what happened.

1576
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:00,897
I need to feel it.

1577
01:21:02,066 --> 01:21:06,361
I just need it to really come from right there.

1578
01:21:06,445 --> 01:21:08,696
Look, man, I'm sorry, all right?

1579
01:21:08,781 --> 01:21:11,032
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1580
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:15,828
I'm really, really sorry that we're
standing here in this situation.

1581
01:21:17,248 --> 01:21:18,456
I'm sorry.

1582
01:21:26,465 --> 01:21:27,549
Okay.

1583
01:21:39,853 --> 01:21:41,104
(SIGHING)

1584
01:21:44,108 --> 01:21:46,401
...seven, eight, nine, 10.

1585
01:21:46,485 --> 01:21:50,363
And the $400 I owe for the old person's home. Perfect.

1586
01:21:55,536 --> 01:21:57,704
You did this to me.

1587
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:58,997
You know that.

1588
01:21:59,164 --> 01:22:02,458
I don't mess with firearms. I don't do that.

1589
01:22:02,543 --> 01:22:05,169
I don't do that. Look, I'm a sensitive guy.

1590
01:22:05,546 --> 01:22:07,338
You know what I'm saying to you?

1591
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,340
Okay.

1592
01:22:13,178 --> 01:22:14,345
Thank you.

1593
01:22:19,184 --> 01:22:20,643

(KNOCKS ON DOOR)

Who the hell are you?

1596
01:22:45,210 --> 01:22:46,502
You got no choice now.

1597
01:22:46,587 --> 01:22:49,005
You got to go right up to him and just say it to him.

1598
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:51,341
It's not that complicated of a thing to do. It's easy.

1599

You got the pictures, she can't bullshit
you, and that's the end of it.

Come here. Get in here, I love you.

1601

Stop it, you will find somebody else.

Ronny.

1605
01:23:30,964 --> 01:23:32,382
Hey.

1606
01:23:39,765 --> 01:23:41,683
We were just about to call you, actually.

1607
01:23:41,767 --> 01:23:44,352
We were hoping to be a little
better prepared, but I guess

1608
01:23:44,436 --> 01:23:45,687
we can start?

1609
01:23:45,771 --> 01:23:47,689
Ronny, why don't you come join us?

1610
01:23:47,773 --> 01:23:48,773
Who are you?

1611
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,400
My name is Dr. Rosenstone.

1612
01:23:50,484 --> 01:23:53,903
Your family and friends are here
because they love you, Ronald.

1613
01:23:53,987 --> 01:23:56,989
And they can't stand to see you
destroy yourself anymore.

What is this, an intervention?

(CRYING) Yes!

1616
01:24:00,452 --> 01:24:02,245
ROSENSTONE: We don't see the need for labels.

1617
01:24:02,329 --> 01:24:05,206
This is just a bunch of friends talking to one friend

1618
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:06,708
and letting them know they love them.

1619

An intervention.

Your sister and her husband would like to start.

Diane, please don't do this.

1623

but I'm here to support you.

DIANE: Ronny, I am!

Okay, okay. It's not what you think.

Come on, sweetheart, sit down. It'll be okay.

that we find ourselves here in
a gentle circle of support.

Oh, shit, am I late?

1639
01:24:56,133 --> 01:25:00,094
I'm sorry. I know it's probably really bad
form to be late to an intervention.

You did? You invited him?

1646
01:25:08,645 --> 01:25:11,939
Yeah. You know what? I followed
you to his place earlier today.

1647
01:25:14,777 --> 01:25:15,943
I saw you pay him.

1648
01:25:16,862 --> 01:25:18,863
And after you left, I went up and talked
to him. (MESSAGE TONE BEEPS)

have no right being here!

He bet on the Hawaii game.

Only degenerates bet on the Hawaii game.

1669

I don't want that for you, man.

1670
01:26:06,286 --> 01:26:08,204
I should have done this a long time ago.

1671
01:26:12,251 --> 01:26:14,418

You got to flip through that one,
get to the other pictures.

I did. I'm flipping right now.

with you and get high with you,

All right, I got something to say.

This is important to me, so... (CLEARS THROAT)

1705

Okay, Nick...

1706
01:27:39,171 --> 01:27:41,839
All right, please. Please?

1707
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:47,637
I didn't have many friends when I got to Ball State.

1708
01:27:47,971 --> 01:27:50,473
I was shy and...

1709
01:27:53,185 --> 01:27:54,852
You already know this.

1710
01:27:57,189 --> 01:28:01,025
But, Ronny, what you don't know is

1711
01:28:01,109 --> 01:28:05,780
when you moved in across the
hall, in second semester,

1712
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:08,074
I made it a goal of mine

1713
01:28:09,493 --> 01:28:11,160
to become friends with you.

1714
01:28:11,244 --> 01:28:14,330
I mean, you were funny and charming,

1715
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:16,540
and everybody liked him, everybody.

1716
01:28:16,625 --> 01:28:19,502
Okay, Nick, enough.

1717
01:28:19,586 --> 01:28:21,963
You got to let me talk here for a second.

1718
01:28:23,090 --> 01:28:25,257
I want you to listen to me.

1719
01:28:25,676 --> 01:28:27,969
Nick, you're my best friend.

1720
01:28:28,637 --> 01:28:30,763
You always make me do better.

1721
01:28:31,515 --> 01:28:34,517
You always make sure I don't screw up.

1722
01:28:34,601 --> 01:28:39,438
And you make it that I never forget
what really matters in life.

1723
01:28:40,440 --> 01:28:42,858
When I had my relapse two years ago,

1724
01:28:42,943 --> 01:28:47,279
it wasn't all the money and stuff that
I lost that made me feel bad.

1725
01:28:47,906 --> 01:28:49,824
It was the fact that I let you down.

1726
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,283
ROSENSTONE: This is good.

1727
01:28:51,368 --> 01:28:52,660
This is catharsis.

1728
01:28:52,744 --> 01:28:53,953
I know.

1729
01:28:54,663 --> 01:28:57,164
You know I never had a brother growing up, right?

1730
01:29:01,962 --> 01:29:05,548
And my dad wasn't around very much.

1731
01:29:06,258 --> 01:29:10,386
And all my friends growing up were, really, criminals.

1732
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:14,974
So when I met you in school, I was...

1733
01:29:15,892 --> 01:29:20,896
Let's just say that I looked up
to you as well, in college.

1734
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:27,111
And I really have looked up to you ever since.

1735
01:29:27,195 --> 01:29:29,697
So, there's something that you should know.

1736
01:29:29,781 --> 01:29:32,158
There's something that I already
should have told you, Nick.

1737
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,326
What is it?

1738
01:29:34,411 --> 01:29:36,412
Geneva's been running on you

1739
01:29:36,496 --> 01:29:38,539
with the guy that you thought was my bookie.

1740
01:29:39,041 --> 01:29:41,167
Jesus Christ, Ronny!

1741
01:29:41,251 --> 01:29:43,252
You thought that you saw an exchange, right?

1742
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:44,712
That it was a gambling exchange,

1743
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:45,880
but it wasn't a gambling exchange.

1744
01:29:45,964 --> 01:29:47,798
Really, I was just going to get my camera,

1745
01:29:47,883 --> 01:29:49,341
because there were pictures and stuff on it.

1746
01:29:50,177 --> 01:29:51,927
The truth is, I'm not gambling.

1747
01:29:52,012 --> 01:29:53,846
I haven't been doing any gambling at all.

1748

What's been going on with me is

1749
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:59,351
I've really been trying to figure out
what's the best way to tell you

1750
01:29:59,436 --> 01:30:01,312
and how to handle this thing.

1751
01:30:02,314 --> 01:30:03,397

No! It's not true.

He'll say anything, he's desperate!

1756

Yes, I do, Geneva.

Because Nick is my best friend.

Okay. When we were in college,

1804
01:32:14,779 --> 01:32:17,364
and this is way before you guys ever met,

1805
01:32:17,574 --> 01:32:20,034
there was a night that didn't mean anything.
It was a meaningless night.

1806
01:32:20,118 --> 01:32:21,452
It was a booze night.

1807
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:23,704
It was big, big bar night.

1808
01:32:23,788 --> 01:32:25,206
Ronny, get to the point.

1809
01:32:25,290 --> 01:32:27,499
The point is, way before you guys ever met,

1810
01:32:27,584 --> 01:32:29,418
before you ever even knew each other,

1811

because I didn't feel safe.

It's not healthy.

The problem is, if you don't share stuff with me,

1860
01:35:56,960 --> 01:36:00,587
like the fact that you were with Geneva,
it keeps me in the dark.

1861
01:36:00,672 --> 01:36:02,923
And that belittles us.

I understand.

1864

I just didn't feel right in saying something to you

if I wasn't saying it to Nick.

1866
01:36:15,854 --> 01:36:18,689
And then, when I found out

1867
01:36:19,315 --> 01:36:20,941
about the Vegas deal

1868
01:36:21,025 --> 01:36:23,152
and that you didn't trust me enough
to share that with me,

then that really hurt.

And it's up to me to un-earn that.

hanging on to something that wasn't there.

I know I didn't date a lot,

1932
01:41:05,309 --> 01:41:07,769
so when Geneva and I were serious,

1933
01:41:08,187 --> 01:41:09,688
you didn't want to hurt me,

1934
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:12,232
and it was before we ever got together.

01:42:35,691 --> 01:42:40,612
when folks were reaching for greatness,
was that not the case?

1959

who wanted to head west

Not all of them.

And it's not that they necessarily got rich.

we've headed out west, and this is our destination.
