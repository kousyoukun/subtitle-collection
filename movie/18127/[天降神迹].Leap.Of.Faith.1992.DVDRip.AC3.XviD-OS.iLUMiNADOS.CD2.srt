1
00:00:00,012 --> 00:00:01,662
myself.

2
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:09,888
Jesus is on the mainline
Tell him what you want

3
00:00:10,091 --> 00:00:18,055
- Lord Jesus
- Tell him what you want

4
00:00:18,266 --> 00:00:22,532
You gotta call him up
And tell him what you want

5
00:00:22,737 --> 00:00:25,205
Call him up, call him up...

6
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:27,306
You tell him!

7
00:00:45,259 --> 00:00:49,127
Am I in white boy heaven
or what? Yes!

8
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,594
That was beautiful, children.

9
00:00:51,799 --> 00:00:53,767
Children? Hm!

10
00:00:55,036 --> 00:00:57,470
I want to tell you about myself.

11
00:00:57,672 --> 00:01:01,904
You look at me and you see a man
who seems a lot like you.

12
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:05,375
But all my life I've been different.

13
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:08,342
At first, it was a curse,

14
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:13,111
but soon I discovered
the blessing of my birth.

15
00:01:13,321 --> 00:01:17,883
Now, what was it, you ask,
made me different?

16
00:01:18,092 --> 00:01:21,118
In an isolated cabin
in the Appalachian mountains,

17
00:01:21,329 --> 00:01:25,766
Jonas Nightengale was born
with a caul about his face.

18
00:01:25,967 --> 00:01:29,368
He told me his father invented Teflon.

19
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,266
Some say the caul's an old wives' tale,

20
00:01:32,473 --> 00:01:35,601
but I've seen some
smart old wives in my day!

21
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:39,746
They say a baby born with a caul
is given the second sight.

22
00:01:39,947 --> 00:01:43,747
The sight inside a man's soul.

23
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,350
Hallelujah!

24
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:48,488
Sister Jane will pass among you...

25
00:01:48,689 --> 00:01:51,954
...and I want you
to ask her your questions.

26
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,254
I'm going to reach deep inside

27
00:01:55,463 --> 00:01:59,365
to find an answer
placed there by God.

28
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:05,062
- What can Jonas do for you tonight?
- How much longer do I have?

29
00:02:05,273 --> 00:02:07,036
Brother Nightengale,

30
00:02:07,241 --> 00:02:11,302
can you tell me the answer
to our brother's question?

31
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:15,174
I'm hearing the voice of angels.

32
00:02:15,383 --> 00:02:19,012
- He's worried how long he has to go.
- Praise be!

33
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:24,624
Whether you've ten years or ten minutes,
what matters is that you really live!

34
00:02:24,826 --> 00:02:29,661
So when God's chariot arrives,
you're ready to step on board!

35
00:02:29,864 --> 00:02:33,630
- Yes, sir!
- I've been widowed about a year.

36
00:02:33,835 --> 00:02:39,239
When they repossessed the farm,
my husband killed himself in the barn.

37
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:45,504
Has the Lord forgiven him
and welcomed him to heaven?

38
00:02:45,713 --> 00:02:49,809
Our sister would sincerely
like to know about a loved one.

39
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,252
I'll give you your answer, sister.

40
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:58,050
He rests with the angels.
He says God has forgiven him.

41
00:02:58,259 --> 00:03:00,625
He asks you to do the same.

42
00:03:02,063 --> 00:03:05,191
When's it gonna rain?

43
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,364
This man's question is really important.

44
00:03:11,973 --> 00:03:13,372
Oh, boy.

45
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:20,341
You want to know what every man
and woman in this tent wants to know.

46
00:03:20,548 --> 00:03:24,314
- You want to know when's it gonna rain!
- Yes! Yes!

47
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:27,818
Let me ask you this question:
What is rain anyway?

48
00:03:28,022 --> 00:03:32,118
Is it the sweet nectar your crops crave?
Is it tears of joy?

49
00:03:32,326 --> 00:03:35,955
Or is it the rain that falls on every life?

50
00:03:36,164 --> 00:03:42,069
The dressing down from your boss?
The bank pounding on the door?

51
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:46,331
When you say to me,
"Jonas, when's it gonna rain?"

52
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:49,135
All I can say is...

53
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:53,575
"When's it gonna stop?"

54
00:03:54,749 --> 00:03:58,344
In the Book of Osalms,
Chapter 27 reads as thus:

55
00:03:58,553 --> 00:04:04,185
"The Lord is my light and my salvation:
Of whom shall I fear?"

56
00:04:04,392 --> 00:04:10,592
The Lord is my light and my salvation

57
00:04:10,798 --> 00:04:12,857
The Lord is the strength!

58
00:04:13,067 --> 00:04:16,628
The Lord is my strength!
The Lord is your strength!

59
00:04:16,837 --> 00:04:19,601
The Lord is the strength of my life!

60
00:04:19,807 --> 00:04:24,244
Strength of my life
Of whom shall I be...

61
00:04:24,445 --> 00:04:29,542
Afraid...

62
00:04:47,602 --> 00:04:50,696
I feel a healing coming on.

63
00:04:52,373 --> 00:04:55,035
- How many love Jesus?
- Yeah!

64
00:04:55,243 --> 00:04:58,440
Are you ready for a miracle?

65
00:05:07,121 --> 00:05:11,387
There it is, the word of God!
Yakety-yak, God's talking back!

66
00:05:12,393 --> 00:05:14,623
- Hey, brother!
- Amen!

67
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:16,421
Whoa, people!

68
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:19,395
Oh! Hallelujah, sister!

69
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,262
Praise Jesus!
You're a slave in the spirit!

70
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:26,406
Receive the holy anointing of Jesus!
Let Jesus fix it!

71
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:29,235
- Somebody run!
- Me?

72
00:05:29,443 --> 00:05:33,436
You, feel the power of the Lord!
Celebrate the Lord!

73
00:05:33,648 --> 00:05:36,014
Celebrate the Lord!

74
00:05:36,217 --> 00:05:38,344
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

75
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,216
Praise Jesus! Praise Jesus!

76
00:05:42,423 --> 00:05:46,689
You're not gonna need this any longer.
I cast out your chains!

77
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:53,897
The sign of the cross! Look!

78
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:56,865
He's in the room! He's alive!

79
00:05:57,071 --> 00:05:59,039
He's in me, he's in you!

80
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:03,108
I see him in your eyes!
I feel him beating in your hearts!

81
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:07,771
Reach up and touch Jesus!
Nice to see you again, sister.

82
00:06:07,982 --> 00:06:11,349
Praise Jesus, praise his name!
Praise the Lord!

83
00:06:11,552 --> 00:06:16,046
Receive his holy name!
Say "Hallelujah!"

84
00:06:17,058 --> 00:06:21,290
I've never seen a room so full of God!
Say, "Thank you, Jesus!"

85
00:06:23,197 --> 00:06:26,496
- Somebody say "Amen."
- Amen!

86
00:06:31,205 --> 00:06:33,196
Hey!

87
00:06:33,407 --> 00:06:34,999
Hey!

88
00:06:37,912 --> 00:06:41,575
Wait a minute, Reverend.
I want to testify.

89
00:06:49,457 --> 00:06:52,551
I said I want to testify.

90
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,921
So speak up, Sheriff.

91
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:01,991
Before you leave your
hard-earned money in those buckets,

92
00:07:02,203 --> 00:07:04,967
I want you to know where it's going.

93
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:08,801
Alias Jonas Nightengale,
born Jack Newton,

94
00:07:09,009 --> 00:07:11,409
does not come from the Appalachians.

95
00:07:11,612 --> 00:07:14,046
He was born in the Bronx.

96
00:07:14,248 --> 00:07:18,378
The closest he came to a church
was the Mary and Joseph Orphanage,

97
00:07:18,586 --> 00:07:21,419
where he lived from five to fifteen.

98
00:07:21,622 --> 00:07:26,525
Then he ran away to begin a life
of crime, including convictions for...

99
00:07:28,396 --> 00:07:29,863
...shoplifting,

100
00:07:30,064 --> 00:07:34,057
possession of marijuana
and grand theft auto,

101
00:07:34,268 --> 00:07:37,135
all before the age of 18.

102
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:42,605
He was arrested for selling fraudulent
art works and passing bad cheques.

103
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:47,770
If you feel you've had a good night's
entertainment, then go ahead,

104
00:07:47,982 --> 00:07:49,711
tip the dancing bear.

105
00:07:49,917 --> 00:07:55,082
But, if you think this money's
going to a man of God,

106
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:58,258
you'd better think again.

107
00:07:58,459 --> 00:07:59,858
I believe in Jonas.

108
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,168
He's a fake!

109
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:21,576
There ain't no way he's a man of God!

110
00:08:35,262 --> 00:08:37,856
Brother Will!

111
00:08:38,065 --> 00:08:41,865
Everything you've said is true.
Absolutely true.

112
00:08:46,173 --> 00:08:50,303
Yes, I was born to lowly circumstances.

113
00:08:50,511 --> 00:08:55,448
Yes, I ran with a bad crowd that
taught me to smoke weed and steal.

114
00:08:56,517 --> 00:08:58,985
I hung out in bars.

115
00:09:00,588 --> 00:09:02,954
And I hot-wired cars.

116
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:07,890
I grew up mistreated,
so I lied and I cheated.

117
00:09:09,163 --> 00:09:13,122
I learned hard crime
and I served hard time.

118
00:09:13,334 --> 00:09:17,532
I have walked that crooked road
and I have danced with Satan.

119
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:21,868
I've been down in the gutter
and looked up into the face of God.

120
00:09:22,076 --> 00:09:24,670
- Praise the Lord!
- Amen!

121
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:28,315
I say to you,
if you wanna give up the bottle,

122
00:09:28,516 --> 00:09:30,780
who you gonna talk to?

123
00:09:30,985 --> 00:09:33,818
- Someone who's never touched a drop?
- No!

124
00:09:34,021 --> 00:09:37,752
If you wanna give up womanising,
who you gonna talk to?

125
00:09:37,958 --> 00:09:41,519
- Some pale-skinned virgin priest?
- No!

126
00:09:41,729 --> 00:09:44,323
If you wanna give up sin -

127
00:09:44,532 --> 00:09:49,731
and I believe everyone here tonight
wants to give up sin -

128
00:09:49,937 --> 00:09:51,632
who can lead you?

129
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,898
You need a real sinner, people.

130
00:09:54,108 --> 00:09:59,136
A sinner of such monumental
proportions that all your sins

131
00:09:59,346 --> 00:10:03,112
couldn't possibly equal
the sins of this King of Sin!

132
00:10:04,985 --> 00:10:08,512
Because you know,
if he can walk that righteous path,

133
00:10:08,722 --> 00:10:12,624
if he can go from grift to grace,
from sin to sanctity,

134
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:15,260
from lowliness to holiness,

135
00:10:15,462 --> 00:10:19,899
that you, with all your everyday sins,

136
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:23,194
can rise up like an angel

137
00:10:23,404 --> 00:10:28,637
and ride that golden elevator
to God's own penthouse in the sky.

138
00:10:33,914 --> 00:10:36,974
Hey, Jake! Jake Bradley!

139
00:10:37,184 --> 00:10:40,415
The bank gave you
last warning on foreclosure.

140
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:42,987
How much did you put in the bucket?

141
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,624
$10.

142
00:10:45,826 --> 00:10:47,487
Sadie McElroy,

143
00:10:47,695 --> 00:10:51,995
you've got two boys in junior college,
your husband's out of work.

144
00:10:52,199 --> 00:10:56,465
I put in 20, Will.
I need all the help I can get.

145
00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:58,365
Amen!

146
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,237
I don't know what to say to you.

147
00:11:03,444 --> 00:11:06,572
You folks have been warned.

148
00:11:10,718 --> 00:11:14,677
Sadie, you need all the help you can get.
You, too, Jake. All of you.

149
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:17,789
I know what you're going through.

150
00:11:17,992 --> 00:11:20,586
But there can be no price on salvation.

151
00:11:20,794 --> 00:11:25,458
So I want you to take back
all your money, every last cent.

152
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:32,538
Bring those buckets out.
Sadie take out twenty; Jake take out ten.

153
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,970
Go ahead.

154
00:11:35,175 --> 00:11:38,975
Because the Lord knows
you still have doubt in your hearts.

155
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:42,615
Without your faith,
I cannot deliver the Word.

156
00:11:42,816 --> 00:11:46,411
- Praise the Lord!
- For the Israelites, he parted the sea.

157
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:49,145
To Moses,
he spoke from the burning bush.

158
00:11:49,356 --> 00:11:53,850
And in your hour of doubt,
the Lord has spoken to me.

159
00:11:54,895 --> 00:11:57,227
He said, "Jonas,

160
00:11:57,431 --> 00:12:02,027
"Jonas, expect a sign."

161
00:12:03,337 --> 00:12:09,242
And if God's wisdom is proven to you,
then may you support this ministry.

162
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:12,776
Because God don't want
no doubt money, no!

163
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,574
And I don't want no doubt money. N-O!

164
00:12:15,783 --> 00:12:21,415
Because doubt money burned the fingers
of the righteous, and I will not be burned!

165
00:12:31,498 --> 00:12:33,466
- You all right?
- Of course.

166
00:12:33,667 --> 00:12:37,103
Plant the twenties
before they leave.

167
00:12:41,141 --> 00:12:43,837
He'll be all right.

168
00:12:47,347 --> 00:12:50,316
It's a highway up to heaven

169
00:12:50,517 --> 00:12:53,816
You just can't walk up there
You've got to have a pure heart

170
00:12:54,021 --> 00:13:00,426
It's a highway up to heaven...

171
00:13:31,425 --> 00:13:33,154
Look, Jane...

172
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,761
Try grovelling.
It goes a long way with me.

173
00:13:38,132 --> 00:13:43,627
- I told you I had a job to do.
- Doing your job is one thing.

174
00:13:43,837 --> 00:13:47,637
Trying to destroy
a human being is another.

175
00:13:47,841 --> 00:13:50,435
Nuclear winter wouldn't destroy him!

176
00:13:50,644 --> 00:13:52,578
Oh, yeah?

177
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:56,272
Let me tell you something
your snooping didn't turn up.

178
00:13:56,483 --> 00:14:00,579
Do you know
how he landed in that orphanage?

179
00:14:02,689 --> 00:14:05,852
- I assume his parents died.
- His parents?

180
00:14:06,059 --> 00:14:08,459
God only knows where his father is.

181
00:14:08,662 --> 00:14:11,495
His mother took him out
shopping one day.

182
00:14:11,698 --> 00:14:16,158
Told him she'd be right back and
that he should wait on the corner.

183
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:20,568
Four days later, he's there waiting.

184
00:14:20,774 --> 00:14:23,800
So the cops lug him off
to Our Mother of Neglect,

185
00:14:24,011 --> 00:14:28,641
where, for five years, he still believes
his mother will come to get him.

186
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:31,477
Finally, he just wised up.

187
00:14:31,685 --> 00:14:36,713
- The jails are full of stories like that.
- Yeah. They sure are.

188
00:14:36,924 --> 00:14:39,688
That's why,
if Jonas was wearing pantyhose

189
00:14:39,893 --> 00:14:43,659
and pointing a rifle,
it wouldn't surprise me.

190
00:14:43,864 --> 00:14:45,923
But he's not.

191
00:14:46,133 --> 00:14:50,399
All he's doing is selling fairy tales
to people who thank him.

192
00:14:50,604 --> 00:14:53,903
The last thing he needs is
a judgemental asshole like you

193
00:14:54,107 --> 00:14:56,541
throwing his past up in his face.

194
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,451
Open up, boss. It's me.

195
00:16:56,330 --> 00:16:59,060
This better be good.

196
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,575
Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me.

197
00:17:10,777 --> 00:17:12,904
Pardon me. Excuse me.

198
00:17:13,113 --> 00:17:14,944
Excuse me.

199
00:17:18,518 --> 00:17:21,487
The Reverend has just arrived.

200
00:17:28,795 --> 00:17:31,355
God bless you, Father.

201
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,525
Praise the Lord!

202
00:17:42,676 --> 00:17:45,702
Praise the Lord! His eyes are open!

203
00:17:55,555 --> 00:17:57,785
You've outdone yourself.

204
00:17:57,991 --> 00:18:01,927
He preached last night
that God would send a sign.

205
00:18:02,129 --> 00:18:04,097
I've seen a hundred signs.

206
00:18:04,297 --> 00:18:09,792
A magnificent sunrise, a green light
when I thought it would turn red.

207
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:12,733
But never have I seen anything like this.

208
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:18,036
You were watching the tent last night.
Anybody switch crucifixes?

209
00:18:18,245 --> 00:18:21,214
No, sir. Not a soul.

210
00:18:27,888 --> 00:18:30,220
Praise the Lord! It's a miracle!

211
00:18:30,424 --> 00:18:31,857
Hallelujah!

212
00:18:46,773 --> 00:18:51,335
An alleged miracle in Rustwater,
whose population of 22,000

213
00:18:51,545 --> 00:18:56,812
in the last few hours
has swelled to over 31,000 people.

214
00:19:47,367 --> 00:19:49,995
Rumour has it
the crucifix performs miracles.

215
00:19:50,203 --> 00:19:56,005
A local man who sustained a burn said
his wound had miraculously healed.

216
00:19:56,209 --> 00:20:00,578
- The question is...
- What are we doing about the rain?

217
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:06,309
Tony's printing some pamphlets
on rainmaking so we'll use them.

218
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,580
There'll be some really
sick people there.

219
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:12,656
Seat them in the back
away from the stage.

220
00:20:12,859 --> 00:20:17,922
And we have our malpractice insurance:
"Only if your faith is strong enough."

221
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:22,033
- Damn, this was a new shirt.
- Have you tried turpentine?

222
00:20:22,235 --> 00:20:25,432
It's no good.
That trick's worth it, though.

223
00:20:25,639 --> 00:20:27,334
An oldie but goodie.

224
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:31,534
- Have you had any sleep lately?
- Too busy to sleep.

225
00:20:31,745 --> 00:20:35,044
Places to go and people to do.

226
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:40,680
How's the badge taking all this?

227
00:20:40,887 --> 00:20:43,788
I heard he couldn't get
an art expert till Tuesday.

228
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:49,519
You heard? Little lovers' tiff?
Wonder how he got so well-informed.

229
00:20:49,729 --> 00:20:54,860
Screw you.
I'm not the one giving out free samples.

230
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:01,463
I just feel bad is all,
these people are so broke.

231
00:21:01,675 --> 00:21:05,736
You feel bad for the poor people
but you want their money.

232
00:21:05,946 --> 00:21:08,779
What's a girl to do?

233
00:21:08,982 --> 00:21:13,351
Move to Kansas?
Marry old Will and slop the hogs?

234
00:21:13,553 --> 00:21:15,885
You can't have it both ways.

235
00:21:16,089 --> 00:21:20,185
I don't believe I defended you.
I'm tired of manipulators.

236
00:21:20,393 --> 00:21:23,658
Manipulators are sneaky. I'm obvious.

237
00:21:23,863 --> 00:21:25,296
And right!

238
00:21:38,044 --> 00:21:41,207
You feeling better now?

239
00:21:42,649 --> 00:21:45,846
Yeah. I guess I just needed to be alone.

240
00:21:48,388 --> 00:21:51,585
I'll take that as a compliment.

241
00:21:54,794 --> 00:21:58,924
- It's before six. I've gotta go.
- Whoa!

242
00:22:00,433 --> 00:22:02,958
Places to go, people to rip off.

243
00:22:03,169 --> 00:22:06,798
Oh, you should talk.
You're consorting with the enemy.

244
00:22:07,007 --> 00:22:10,465
Well, I'm an easy consort.

245
00:22:18,885 --> 00:22:22,252
You ever think about settling down?

246
00:22:24,524 --> 00:22:27,789
My mother taught me never to settle.

247
00:22:27,994 --> 00:22:32,829
You're fast on your feet, Jane,
but someday you may wanna slow down.

248
00:22:33,033 --> 00:22:34,625
No.

249
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:37,667
Sorry, Will. I don't do slow.

250
00:22:42,008 --> 00:22:45,603
Come on. I want to show you something.

251
00:22:48,148 --> 00:22:52,278
They travel over two thousand miles
and end up here,

252
00:22:52,485 --> 00:22:55,682
back with the same mate,
year after year.

253
00:22:55,889 --> 00:22:59,586
What are you talking about?
I don't see anything.

254
00:22:59,793 --> 00:23:04,492
They started arriving last week.
There's only a few thousand right now.

255
00:23:04,698 --> 00:23:08,031
What started arriving?
I don't see anything.

256
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:09,895
Watch.

257
00:23:29,489 --> 00:23:31,684
Ain't they beautiful?

258
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:37,391
- Oh, they like me.
- Fantastic!

259
00:23:40,767 --> 00:23:46,535
Jane, I'm not a flashy guy,
but what I promise I deliver.

260
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:52,671
- I'd like to make you some promises.
- You've known me three days!

261
00:23:52,879 --> 00:23:55,643
I'm a quick study.

262
00:24:03,356 --> 00:24:06,291
By Tuesday, you'll be gone.

263
00:24:06,493 --> 00:24:09,360
If I had more time, I'd take it.

264
00:24:20,573 --> 00:24:23,337
Why don't you come tonight?
Lt'll be fun.

265
00:24:23,543 --> 00:24:25,511
The crew has a bet going.

266
00:24:25,712 --> 00:24:29,478
Everybody had to come up
with some ridiculous word.

267
00:24:29,682 --> 00:24:35,120
Jonas has to work them into his sermon,
and if he fails, you win the pot.

268
00:24:35,321 --> 00:24:37,482
Guess what my phrase is.

269
00:24:37,690 --> 00:24:40,386
Aluminum siding.

270
00:24:40,593 --> 00:24:43,027
Aluminum siding!

271
00:24:43,229 --> 00:24:46,392
You can get caught up in the frills of life!

272
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,999
Samsonite luggage,
the Amana washer.

273
00:24:49,202 --> 00:24:52,535
But you know
what's really important, don't you?

274
00:24:52,739 --> 00:24:54,604
Are you ready for the truth?

275
00:24:54,808 --> 00:24:56,833
Are you ready for the Word?

276
00:24:57,043 --> 00:24:59,773
We gotta get back
to that old-time religion.

277
00:24:59,979 --> 00:25:01,776
Where is she?

278
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:08,644
All right. What if I told you
one good deed returns ten good ones?

279
00:25:08,855 --> 00:25:10,516
Would you believe me?

280
00:25:10,723 --> 00:25:15,251
If I told you that one righteous day
would return ten days of fortune?

281
00:25:15,462 --> 00:25:17,225
Would you believe me?

282
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:22,231
What if I told you $1 in the service
of the Lord would return ten-fold?

283
00:25:22,435 --> 00:25:25,029
- Would you believe me?
- Yes!

284
00:25:25,238 --> 00:25:29,641
- Yo, I'm here.
- It's about time... for a miracle!

285
00:25:29,843 --> 00:25:35,008
- I believe, brother, I believe!
- What is it? Come up here.

286
00:25:36,082 --> 00:25:39,017
- What's your name?
- Calvin Tweedy.

287
00:25:39,219 --> 00:25:40,516
Go ahead.

288
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:47,216
Last night, I only had $10 in my wallet
and my wife Kate made me give it all.

289
00:25:47,427 --> 00:25:49,327
God bless you, Kate!

290
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:52,362
Then you said to take it back and I did.

291
00:25:52,565 --> 00:25:57,867
But this morning I had $30,
and I had no $20 bill before that.

292
00:25:58,071 --> 00:26:00,505
Well, hallelujah! It's a miracle!

293
00:26:00,707 --> 00:26:03,642
- It happened to me, too!
- I got 40!

294
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:08,940
Hallelujah, it's a miracle!
Turn it loose, Bruce, and get back, Jack!

295
00:26:09,148 --> 00:26:13,016
Rustwater, Kansas,
is some kind of holy town.

296
00:26:13,219 --> 00:26:18,020
I've never seen such a demonstration
of the Lord's plenty. Say, "Amen!"

297
00:26:18,224 --> 00:26:20,692
Say, "Hallelujah!"

298
00:26:20,894 --> 00:26:24,796
All right, let's give some empty lives
a little meaning!

299
00:26:27,767 --> 00:26:30,361
I believe we'll see
some miracles tonight.

300
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:33,095
Come on up,
I'm working for Jesus!

301
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:38,039
He's coming through me,
special delivery! Hallelujah!

302
00:26:40,613 --> 00:26:44,777
A fever is on me! A fever is on me!

303
00:26:44,984 --> 00:26:47,509
Do you hear him call?

304
00:26:49,255 --> 00:26:52,691
Fall into the spirit of Jesus Christ!

305
00:26:52,892 --> 00:26:55,520
Prepare to receive your miracle!

306
00:26:56,863 --> 00:27:00,765
Oh, I'm feeling the power tonight!
I'm feeling the power!

307
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:03,026
Invite him in, sisters!

308
00:27:03,236 --> 00:27:06,865
Somebody has just
been cured of their rheumatism.

309
00:27:07,073 --> 00:27:10,736
Receive a fresh anointing!
Watch out, I'm vibrating!

310
00:27:10,944 --> 00:27:14,573
I'm vibrating, I'm vibrating with Jesus!

311
00:27:16,049 --> 00:27:18,882
I'm feeling the power!
Come on, brother!

312
00:27:19,085 --> 00:27:22,919
Let Jesus in.
He's speaking the language of the Lord!

313
00:27:23,122 --> 00:27:26,580
The language of the Lord! Hallelujah!

314
00:27:27,026 --> 00:27:29,927
Fall into Jesus!

315
00:27:30,129 --> 00:27:32,859
The Angels of Mercy!

316
00:27:33,066 --> 00:27:35,796
I'm boxing for Jesus!

317
00:27:36,002 --> 00:27:40,098
This room is burning up
with the fever of the Lord!

318
00:27:40,306 --> 00:27:41,933
Hallelujah, brother!

319
00:27:42,942 --> 00:27:45,342
Hey, Reverend. Hey, Rev!

320
00:27:45,545 --> 00:27:49,072
Hey, Rev, what about me?

321
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:53,274
I've no more healing power left in me.

322
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:56,853
- Rev, what about me?
- That's it!

323
00:27:57,056 --> 00:28:01,652
I'm all done in from the service
to the Lord! Thank you, Jesus!

324
00:28:01,861 --> 00:28:06,628
Dance, brother, dance!
Celebrate the miracles of the Lord!

325
00:28:06,833 --> 00:28:09,961
- Another one!
- What about Boyd?

326
00:28:10,169 --> 00:28:13,036
One more! One more!

327
00:28:17,710 --> 00:28:19,837
So glad you could make it.

328
00:28:20,046 --> 00:28:23,777
I had to cold read 20 people
and I was not brilliant.

329
00:28:23,983 --> 00:28:26,247
One more! One more!

330
00:28:26,452 --> 00:28:29,546
I think you've got a little problem here.

331
00:28:29,756 --> 00:28:32,190
One more! One more!

332
00:28:32,392 --> 00:28:36,920
Take it from me, babe,
you can't have it both ways.

333
00:28:37,130 --> 00:28:39,826
One more! One more!

334
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:42,900
One more! One more!

335
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:55,537
One more! One more!

336
00:28:55,748 --> 00:28:58,683
One more! One more!

337
00:29:09,629 --> 00:29:11,790
Hallelujah!

338
00:29:18,738 --> 00:29:23,334
You asked for one more demonstration
of the Lord's kindness, a show of faith.

339
00:29:23,543 --> 00:29:28,037
It's about faith. You gotta have it
or you can't get healed.

340
00:29:28,247 --> 00:29:32,809
If there's any doubt in your hearts,
the Lord cannot deliver.

341
00:29:33,019 --> 00:29:37,979
Even if one of you doubts, like you,
Will. I know you have doubts.

342
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:43,026
You must believe, because this boy's
chances of walking are in your hands.

343
00:29:43,229 --> 00:29:44,526
Amen!

344
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:48,920
Brothers and sisters,
I ask you to consider

345
00:30:49,128 --> 00:30:53,792
the fate of an innocent
rests in the heart of a cynic.

346
00:31:30,369 --> 00:31:33,429
You can do it. You can do it.

347
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,472
Release your faith!

348
00:32:04,203 --> 00:32:06,603
Hallelujah! Another miracle!

349
00:32:06,806 --> 00:32:09,775
Have faith in Jesus! Faith in Jesus!

350
00:32:20,253 --> 00:32:22,949
- Amen!
- Hallelujah!

351
00:32:37,536 --> 00:32:40,369
How did you do it, Reverend?

352
00:32:41,941 --> 00:32:43,465
Son of a bitch!

353
00:33:13,339 --> 00:33:16,934
Are you gonna tell me
what really happened out there?

354
00:33:17,143 --> 00:33:19,873
I've been had. I've been hustled.

355
00:33:20,079 --> 00:33:22,240
What are you talking about?

356
00:33:22,448 --> 00:33:25,246
They got a great act,
the waitress and Tiny Tim!

357
00:33:25,451 --> 00:33:29,217
That story about the trucker,
a drunken trucker.

358
00:33:29,422 --> 00:33:34,121
- Details, the mark of a great con!
- Forget it. Not those two.

359
00:33:34,627 --> 00:33:37,095
They're not like you.

360
00:33:38,431 --> 00:33:40,228
Come on.

361
00:33:40,433 --> 00:33:43,869
Remember me?
I'm Jane, your partner in crime.

362
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,164
Did you see them?
They're going out of their minds.

363
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:50,809
I had to clear the tent
or they'd have torn it down.

364
00:33:51,010 --> 00:33:55,413
- You should see the money coming in.
- By this time tomorrow...

365
00:33:55,614 --> 00:33:58,082
...we're gonna be on every TV station.

366
00:33:58,284 --> 00:34:03,017
- We can play New Orleans...
- Tell me the truth.

367
00:34:03,222 --> 00:34:07,420
What is this,
an elaborate set-up or what?

368
00:34:07,626 --> 00:34:09,719
What do you think?

369
00:34:11,030 --> 00:34:13,055
Holy shit!

370
00:34:13,265 --> 00:34:17,531
Jonas, I gotta hand it to you.
Getting that kid was genius!

371
00:34:17,737 --> 00:34:22,765
Give that kid a haircut,
put him in some fancy clothes on stage!

372
00:34:22,975 --> 00:34:26,502
- That's money in the bank!
- Maybe he can re-enact it.

373
00:34:26,712 --> 00:34:30,341
Do you know what we could bring in
in Dallas in one week?

374
00:34:30,549 --> 00:34:31,846
Seven figures!

375
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:37,079
Seven figures, man!
Jonas, man, what do you think?

376
00:34:41,727 --> 00:34:44,025
Come on, Jonas.

377
00:34:48,634 --> 00:34:52,730
- Do it!
- You're a genius, man!

378
00:34:52,938 --> 00:34:54,235
Genius!

379
00:34:55,207 --> 00:34:56,504
Jonas, wait!

380
00:34:56,709 --> 00:35:00,941
Listen. We made a lot of money
and until now it's been great.

381
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:04,514
- But this is different.
- Come on, Jane.

382
00:35:04,717 --> 00:35:07,914
No! That is not one of our shills in there.

383
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:10,748
I don't know what,
but something happened.

384
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:15,017
- You're right about that.
- You can't take this away from him.

385
00:35:15,227 --> 00:35:20,062
- You can't make him into a sideshow.
- You think not?

386
00:35:20,266 --> 00:35:25,602
Wow! You really don't give a shit
about anybody, do you?

387
00:35:25,805 --> 00:35:28,603
Janey, I never pretended I did.

388
00:35:28,808 --> 00:35:31,333
God, you're right.

389
00:35:31,544 --> 00:35:35,480
You never did.
You still don't care who you hurt.

390
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:37,876
See how this feels.

391
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:45,316
Jane!

392
00:35:47,927 --> 00:35:49,986
Janey!

393
00:36:27,366 --> 00:36:29,095
Hey, boss.

394
00:36:30,736 --> 00:36:33,637
Remember me? Jack Newton.

395
00:36:34,707 --> 00:36:36,766
Got a question for you.

396
00:36:38,677 --> 00:36:42,078
Why did you make so many suckers?

397
00:36:56,595 --> 00:36:59,120
You say, "Love never endeth."

398
00:36:59,331 --> 00:37:02,528
Well, I say, "Love never starteth!"

399
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:04,896
"The meek shall inherit the earth."

400
00:37:05,104 --> 00:37:08,130
The meek just get
the short end of the stick!

401
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:12,436
You say, "Is anyone pure of heart?"
I say, "Not one!"

402
00:37:12,645 --> 00:37:14,636
Rev?

403
00:37:20,252 --> 00:37:22,345
Hello, Boyd.

404
00:37:23,622 --> 00:37:27,217
Why aren't you out
signing autographs? Or dancing?

405
00:37:28,627 --> 00:37:31,289
I need to ask you a question.

406
00:37:33,766 --> 00:37:36,963
I wanted to know
when you planned to leave town.

407
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:40,570
Leave? A couple of days, I guess.

408
00:37:45,444 --> 00:37:49,380
Well, I wanted to know
if I could go with you.

409
00:37:50,449 --> 00:37:53,941
- Well...
- I can do things. I'll earn my keep.

410
00:37:55,654 --> 00:37:59,681
You're too old
to be running away with the circus.

411
00:37:59,892 --> 00:38:02,417
No, it's not that.

412
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:08,294
Look, you made me walk again.
Many people tried that, but they couldn't.

413
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:12,766
Hold it, kid.
I had nothing to do with you walking.

414
00:38:12,972 --> 00:38:14,599
Sure you did.

415
00:38:14,807 --> 00:38:20,712
I run a show here. A lot of smoke
and noise strictly for the suckers!

416
00:38:20,913 --> 00:38:24,007
I've been pulling scams
since I was your age.

417
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:28,482
If there's one thing I know,
it's how to spot the genuine article.

418
00:38:28,687 --> 00:38:31,212
That's what you gotta watch out for.

419
00:38:31,423 --> 00:38:36,190
Not the cops.
You can always get around the cops.

420
00:38:36,395 --> 00:38:40,388
But what you can never get around
is the genuine article.

421
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:44,330
And you, kid, are the genuine article.

422
00:38:46,372 --> 00:38:50,502
- Are you saying you think you're a fake?
- I know I'm a fake.

423
00:38:50,709 --> 00:38:55,442
What difference does it make,
if you get the job done?

424
00:38:55,648 --> 00:39:00,642
Kid, it makes
all the difference in the world.

425
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:05,350
Boyd?

426
00:39:10,396 --> 00:39:12,956
Everyone's looking for you.

427
00:39:13,165 --> 00:39:14,462
OK.

428
00:39:16,168 --> 00:39:19,103
Well, what do you think?

429
00:39:20,739 --> 00:39:23,003
All right, kid, I'll tell you what.

430
00:39:23,208 --> 00:39:27,304
I'll meet you in front of the diner
at ten in the morning.

431
00:39:35,754 --> 00:39:38,188
So I'll see you then?

432
00:39:41,727 --> 00:39:44,719
I'll be back in a minute.

433
00:39:51,437 --> 00:39:54,099
I want to thank you.

434
00:39:55,174 --> 00:39:58,041
I don't know why my brother's walking,

435
00:39:58,243 --> 00:40:01,906
but I'll be grateful for the rest of my life.

436
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:09,785
Marva?

437
00:40:11,156 --> 00:40:16,423
Ten in the morning, your brother's
gonna be standing in front of the diner.

438
00:40:16,628 --> 00:40:20,564
- Give him a message for me?
- Yeah.

439
00:40:23,068 --> 00:40:28,438
Tell him that just because
a person didn't show up,

440
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,009
doesn't mean that the person
doesn't care about him.

441
00:41:30,869 --> 00:41:33,929
You read it?
OK, we'll go over it again.

442
00:41:34,139 --> 00:41:37,939
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want..."

443
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:43,507
Here you go.
Come back for seconds.

444
00:42:42,007 --> 00:42:44,840
Jane. You OK?

445
00:42:45,043 --> 00:42:46,874
Hi.

446
00:44:33,218 --> 00:44:34,685
Thanks.

447
00:44:43,362 --> 00:44:46,331
Souvenir of someone I once knew.

448
00:44:47,866 --> 00:44:51,529
- Where are you headed?
- Pensacola, Florida.

449
00:44:51,737 --> 00:44:54,171
Never been there.

450
00:44:57,175 --> 00:45:01,077
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- No, no, no.

451
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:03,440
No, sir.

452
00:45:03,649 --> 00:45:07,085
Maybe for the first time in my life I'm not.

453
00:45:13,892 --> 00:45:16,861
Well, damn! Would you look at that?

454
00:45:54,366 --> 00:45:56,231
Yes, sir!

455
00:45:57,636 --> 00:45:59,536
Yes, sir!

456
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:54,148
Praise Jesus!

457
00:48:07,566 --> 00:48:09,830
Come on, baby!

458
00:48:10,035 --> 00:48:12,833
Come on, baby, rain!

459
00:48:13,038 --> 00:48:14,733
Rain!

460
00:48:14,940 --> 00:48:17,272
Thank you, Jesus!
