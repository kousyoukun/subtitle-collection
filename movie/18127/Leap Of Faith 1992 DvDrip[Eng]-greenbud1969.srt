1
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:18,240
- Hand over that gun!
- You thought you held all the cards.

2
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:21,560
You thought you'd force me
not to file for divorce.

3
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,040
Erica, the gun is mine. I want it.

4
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,000
Not until I've had a good explanation.

5
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,520
Shit! Shit!

6
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,920
- What's going on?
- Drunk-driving in Atlanta, remember?

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,600
- Did he see you?
- I don't think so.

8
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:58,440
Get up.

9
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,360
- Whose is this?
- Mine.

10
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,360
- I don't know, 80 in a 55.
- You'll never get away with it.

11
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,360
O ye of little faith!

12
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:18,120
- Did you fix that transmitter?
- Ready.

13
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:20,720
What's going on?

14
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,880
Turn me on.

15
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,800
- I'm just a country boy!
- I'll cover that.

16
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,760
Frequency 6, check your local listings.

17
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:36,440
- A cold reading, $10 ante, who's in?
- I'm with my boss.

18
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,080
I say he can't do it.

19
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,000
Where's your loyalty?

20
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,520
- Oh, child, he looks nasty!
- This is gonna be real good.

21
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,000
Sh! Listen.

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,680
Is this beautiful country or what?
How fast was I going?

23
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:56,880
- 80 in a 55.
- Whoa! Really?

24
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,880
Licence and registration.

25
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,400
Yes, sir.

26
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:04,360
Let's see what we got here, Lowell.
Let's see.

27
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,520
A playing card. My only royal flush,
signed by Shorty Casewell.

28
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,520
Let's see. We got...

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
Licence and registration, sir.

30
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,960
Relax, where's the fire?

31
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:26,600
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Do you have the documents?

32
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,680
Course I do. I'm a law-abiding citizen,
just like yourself.

33
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,880
The difference is there's more to life
than my nine to five.

34
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:43,240
If you knew that, you'd still have
a wife and daughter to go home to.

35
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,080
Sir, put your hands on the bus,
feet apart.

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,560
Whoa! A little cranky, aren't we?

37
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,640
- What's he doing?
- He's gone too far, as usual.

38
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,880
You could've bought me dinner first!

39
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,640
We're gonna take a walk
over to the car, sir. This way.

40
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,040
- He's going to jail.
- He's not.

41
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,920
He stopped writing, didn't he?

42
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:13,240
Oh, man.

43
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:20,360
Enough about me, Lowell.
It's not really me you're mad at.

44
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,800
You're mad at yourself, 'cause you lost
the person who loved you.

45
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,560
- You have the right to remain silent.
- "Frequency of names..."

46
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,600
- Anything you say will...
- "By decade, by religion..."

47
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:38,440
I'm not talking about your ex-wife.
You know who I'm talking about...

48
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,920
...Cathy.

49
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,080
Cathy.

50
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,720
Son of a bitch.

51
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:48,920
The guy has balls
the size of cantaloupes!

52
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,840
You think I don't know how it is?
Risking your life for minimum wage.

53
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:58,000
Never enough for those pretty dresses,

54
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,640
that fancy summer camp
all her friends went to.

55
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,080
Then some rich asshole
takes not only your wife,

56
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,720
but your own little girl.

57
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,600
Have you seen her?

58
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,480
Can't say that I have,
but I know people.

59
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:17,720
And I know she misses the way
you protected her. Like a princess.

60
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,880
The way you smiled at her
the night of the prom.

61
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,960
Good times teaching her the violin.

62
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,280
The what?

63
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:31,360
Violin...

64
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,160
Clair de lune.

65
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:38,320
We played that together.

66
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:41,160
No rich step-daddy can give her that.

67
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,640
She hasn't called in over a year.

68
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:49,280
You made her choose between you
and her mother. You drove her away.

69
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,280
Maybe I'll call her tonight.

70
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,400
Tonight...

71
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,400
When I got a phone
right there on that bus?

72
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,440
You wouldn't mind?

73
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:11,760
My brother Lowell,
what are friends for?

74
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,360
Yeah!

75
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,120
Yeah!

76
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,160
I talked to her and
I'll go see her on the weekend.

77
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,800
- Thank you, Brother Lowell.
- I can't thank you enough.

78
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,480
Praise the Lord!

79
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,880
- Did she win?
- And he made a donation. Unbelievable!

80
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:37,360
I got the Wellesley decal
and the wedding band, but the violin?

81
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,160
Red mark on the jaw from the chin rest.
You know me, I know people!

82
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,760
Yeah, well, I'll make it back
just when you least expect it.

83
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:51,000
I always expect it.
That's why I always win.

84
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:56,040
If it wasn't for you, I'd be playing
doctor with some car thief.

85
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,080
- What can I say, man?
- Just say, "Thank you, Jesus!"

86
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:32,120
- You OK back there?
- Something's blown.

87
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,760
Man!

88
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,680
What's happened?

89
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:38,200
Truck's blowing smoke, man.

90
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,720
- Next exit, let's get off.
- You got it.

91
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,640
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
This is the place.

92
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,640
- You know where we are?
- This is nowhere.

93
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:18,720
Hey, what's up?

94
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:22,840
We don't get a replacement part
till Tuesday. Yeah, four days!

95
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,760
- Shit! We'd clean up in Topeka.
- Yeah.

96
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,760
I'm exhausted. We could use a break.

97
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,480
You're gonna get one. We got no choice.

98
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,320
I always have a choice.
Set up, we'll play here.

99
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,040
Here?

100
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,200
Here.

101
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,200
This is where the truckers come.

102
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,960
This looks nice.

103
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:01,520
I can smell trouble like shit on a griddle.

104
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:04,440
Take a look at what just walked in.

105
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:07,560
Dolores, you are such a bone-hound.

106
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,160
Everybody needs a hobby.

107
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,320
Even you.

108
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:19,600
- Sit down here, baby.
- Like I was saying, that man is nasty!

109
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,760
They believe, yeah!

110
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:31,200
- He ain't gonna bother you or me.
- I know.

111
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:38,360
Marva, huh? As in "Marvellous"?

112
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,840
- As in my grandmother.
- Not for a second.

113
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:44,800
- I'm Jonas.
- Hi.

114
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,200
Something got you down suddenly?

115
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,320
I never knew a problem
Chuck Berry couldn't solve.

116
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,760
It's broken.

117
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:03,160
Maybe I can fix it.
Life's too short to go without music.

118
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,080
Why don't you try laying on hands?

119
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,520
I wish I could, ma'am,
'cause I know how Jesus loves to rock.

120
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,320
Where's your manners?
He's a preacher. Be polite.

121
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,440
Hm, corn relish! I hate corn relish.

122
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,200
- First female serial killer?
- Aileen Wuornos.

123
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,720
- How many victims?
- Eight.

124
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:32,080
Special is steak.
No liver, no fish, no spinach.

125
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,640
- Awful lot of noes there, Marva.
- No lip.

126
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,960
I'll take the diet plate, please.

127
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,960
- She wants me.
- Yeah!

128
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:48,640
You should stick
with your bible-boinkers.

129
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:50,840
A woman is like a slingshot.

130
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:55,080
The greater the resistance,
the further you can get with her.

131
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:57,040
Besides, she's warming up.

132
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,800
What brought him
to the service of Our Lord?

133
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,480
You know, Georgette, to me
there's no greater thrill than preaching.

134
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:08,480
First moment, you wonder,
"Can I touch them?

135
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:12,400
"Will they feel what I feel?"

136
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:19,000
Sometimes they don't feel it at first,
that sense of needing the Lord.

137
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,800
You know how it feels to really need
something, don't you, Georgette?

138
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:27,040
- Your order?
- Two chilies. Hold the onions.

139
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,600
Sometimes a person doesn't
know what they need.

140
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:36,320
They wake up itchy,
hungry for whiskey or money or food.

141
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,240
What they really need is love.

142
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,160
Sweet, tender caresses of the Lord.

143
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,720
- Amen! All right, Reverend.
- Amen.

144
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,560
- May I take your order?
- Sure.

145
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,360
I'll have the KKK omelette.

146
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,440
Whites only.

147
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,640
Get out of here!

148
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm kidding. I'll have a decaf and toast.

149
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:07,520
And I give them that love, Georgette,
That... and salvation!

150
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,400
Salvation is the only thing
in this world that matters.

151
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,600
More comforting than a lover.
More valuable than diamonds.

152
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,040
Come on, Preacher! Come on!

153
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:21,360
See this?

154
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:26,720
It was a gift from my sainted mother
the year I graduated seminary.

155
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:28,800
- God bless her.
- Very nice.

156
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,400
I'll get it.

157
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,040
See, Marva?

158
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,400
Nothing has value without salvation.

159
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:56,680
- He put it in the water!
- Just like it was baptised!

160
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,680
He loves the Lord!

161
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,240
What's the date?

162
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:30,680
Someone could notice that
in a small town.

163
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,200
It pisses off the law. They think
I've a year's salary on my wrist.

164
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,840
The sheriff is Braverman.
He's clean.

165
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,080
Clean? Ugh!

166
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:46,440
Mr Nightengale,
arbitrary is not an issue here.

167
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,960
We've got a 27% unemployment rate.

168
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,480
- I need 20 guys for four days.
- Great! 26%!

169
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,920
Look, no new permits
till the plants reopen

170
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,480
or till our farmers get some rain.

171
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,040
Till then, this town can't afford a revival.

172
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,000
- Sorry.
- Oh, no. I understand, Sheriff.

173
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,200
- You're just trying to do your job.
- No. He's trying to restrict trade.

174
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,760
Listen, Braverman.

175
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,240
I got a room full of New York lawyers
dying to take on some badge

176
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,640
interfering with religious freedom!

177
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:29,080
I got the fee, I'll do the paperwork.
You give me the permit or I dial 2-1-2.

178
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,520
- Knock yourself out.
- I'll do it.

179
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:54,360
Don't take it personally, boss.
It's just one for the big guy upstairs.

180
00:15:56,600 --> 00:16:01,080
So, is all of this
absolutely necessary, Will?

181
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,040
Local law.
"The Attack of the Puny Brains".

182
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:12,120
I kissed up to him, I got the permit.

183
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,520
Besides, this one's cute for a change.
Now, concentrate.

184
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,440
Population: 22-something.
Median family income: $21,000...

185
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,640
Cute? He can shut us down.

186
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:28,040
I don't have to remind you
what our nut is: 3,500 a day.

187
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:32,520
Every town, another puny brain.

188
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,640
Give a little man power,
he thinks he's powerful.

189
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:41,040
Yeah, I've seen that happen before.
OK, main industries: Wheat and corn.

190
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:47,360
Ancillaries have had massive lay-offs.
The banks report 22% farm foreclosure.

191
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:51,720
If they don't get rain by this weekend,
this year's crops will fail.

192
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,960
So we can use that.
Stop drumming, Jonas! Stop!

193
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,560
What a shit-hole!

194
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,680
This was your choice, so live with it.

195
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:04,840
Average education: 10th grade.
Richest family: The Rayloves.

196
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,160
12 towns in the same area,
same situation...

197
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:12,120
I gotta get you a man.
You've been on the road too long.

198
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:15,880
We're gonna hire us a new angel.
You pick him!

199
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,840
- Finished?
- I'm starting to get excited.

200
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:24,520
A town this deep in the crapper's
got nowhere to turn but God!

201
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,920
Kansas Radio.

202
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,120
When the going gets tough,
the tough dial S-O-S.

203
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,480
Speaking of things getting tough,

204
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:43,200
I've got someone here who says
he can help. Jonas Nightengale.

205
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:47,880
A man who knows
about the value of spirit.

206
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,920
Thank you, Jerry Joe. Thank you.

207
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:55,480
You know, as I look out your window,

208
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:58,240
Rustwater reminds me
of my own home town.

209
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,920
Drugstore soda fountain.

210
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,400
Little movie theatre.
The one with the real butter.

211
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,600
And it warms my heart.

212
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:14,240
So many people working so hard,
deserving so much better.

213
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:19,920
I know how it feels to see
old man Raylove driving his fancy car,

214
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,720
all the while thinking,
"I want me a car like that."

215
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:27,480
The problem is
you've got nothing to believe in.

216
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:30,680
Can't believe in the community
with its trouble,

217
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,840
it seems sometimes even the family.
So what do you believe in?

218
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:39,000
The biggest power,
the biggest man with the plan...

219
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,960
30 seconds.

220
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,360
So I'm here to remind you
that tonight

221
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:52,960
at the Rustwater camp-ground
you too, can be saved.

222
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:58,120
If you're already walking with Jesus,
celebrate your faith with your neighbour.

223
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,000
It's been too long since you've seen him.

224
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,920
If you're still driving that beat-up pickup,
eating macaroni and day-old bread,

225
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:13,080
come and celebrate the miracle of faith,
the power of healing.

226
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:16,000
And you too, can wake up saying,

227
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,240
"Thank you, Jesus!"

228
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,160
I been lonely, I been cheated

229
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:27,920
I been misunderstood

230
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:33,160
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good

231
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:36,280
But with you I belong

232
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,840
'Cause you help me be strong

233
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:41,600
There's a change in my life

234
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,360
Since you came along
Oh, yeah

235
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:55,800
Now I don't mind working
So hard every day...

236
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,040
Your wife was great to meet.
I'm Jonas Nightengale.

237
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:06,640
Come down for an old-fashioned
revival with lots of music and singing.

238
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,360
And bring your wife along tonight.

239
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,680
Bye-bye.

240
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:15,680
Thank you.

241
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,960
I been lonely, I been cheated

242
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:30,160
I been misunderstood

243
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:35,040
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good

244
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:40,240
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong

245
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,960
There's a change in my life...

246
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,640
Hey, what's your name?

247
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:50,400
You go to high school here?
No? Going to college?

248
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:56,080
Now, a man, a man gets crazy
When he finds he's done wrong

249
00:20:56,320 --> 00:21:00,880
And a heart, a heart gets weary
When it doesn't belong

250
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:07,120
And the road, the road gets rocky, Lord
You've got to keep on

251
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:13,760
Let the new light come
Shining on through

252
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,520
I been lonely, I been cheated...

253
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:20,880
Tonight, tomorrow night and the next...

254
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:24,760
Hey, Jonas Nightengale.
How are you?

255
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,360
Keep your eye on the squirt gun.

256
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,880
One, two, three!

257
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,440
Gone.

258
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,400
Come to the tent meeting.
Miracles and wonders.

259
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:49,760
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong

260
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:55,320
There's a change in my life
Since you came along

261
00:21:55,520 --> 00:22:00,040
I been lonely, I been cheated
I been misunderstood

262
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:05,120
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good

263
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:09,560
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong

264
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,400
There's a change in my life

265
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:15,040
Since you came along...

266
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,360
I sink this one,
you guys come to the meeting?

267
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,800
- Yeah, all right.
- OK.

268
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,600
Afternoon, sir.

269
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,840
Sheriff sent me to check for violations.

270
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:37,080
I bet he did.
Go ahead, we're clean. Go on.

271
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:39,440
Knock yourself out.

272
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,920
Great. It's a frigging hootenanny!

273
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
You've been very busy, Will.

274
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:03,440
Just doing my job.

275
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,040
Yeah, I can see that.

276
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,520
It's been a long day.
Can I buy you a beer?

277
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,920
Tell me, do most of the cops
fall for your act?

278
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,520
Yeah.

279
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:23,400
I'll bet they do.

280
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:26,960
Well, ma'am, sorry about the drink,
but I'm on duty.

281
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:32,800
No, no. My mom is "ma'am".
You can call me Jane.

282
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,120
All right.

283
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,120
Goodbye, Jane.

284
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,280
Goodbye, Will.

285
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,840
Just kidding.

286
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:04,600
You have any towels?

287
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:07,600
Wow, nice room!

288
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:10,760
What's the matter? You seem down.

289
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:15,800
I'm just bummed about Topeka.
I wanted to see that breeder.

290
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:21,680
- You can't keep a Great Dane on a bus.
- Why not?

291
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:24,720
Lt'd be great company.

292
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,280
Why don't you give this to me?
It looks better on me.

293
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,440
You'll get it when I die unless you kill me.

294
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,600
And it's in my will that way.

295
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:45,280
- My offer still holds for a new angel.
- I can just see it.

296
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:50,800
"Wanted: Single tenor with interest
in gourmet cooking and mail fraud."

297
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,280
- What's new with Miss Congeniality?
- Nothing.

298
00:25:55,480 --> 00:26:00,080
And I'm using all my "A" material.
How could she not go for it?

299
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:03,160
So you strike out for once.
What do you care?

300
00:26:03,360 --> 00:26:07,120
It's got me curious.
She's got fuming down to an art.

301
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:10,200
It's a matter of principle, like a quest.

302
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,560
Sort of a Holy Grail of road pussy?

303
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,000
Eloquent as always.

304
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,560
Tambourines, T-shirts, bumper stickers!

305
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,880
Bibles! Tambourines!

306
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,160
Tambourines, T-shirts, bumper stickers!

307
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,200
Get your bibles here!

308
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:37,080
How are you doing this evening?
Come right in. Come right in.

309
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,600
Tambourines! Praise the Lord!

310
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:45,360
Bibles! T-shirts! Bumper stickers!

311
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:49,160
- Come on up!
- Come right in!

312
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,200
Bumper stickers!

313
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:56,000
Have you ever seen anything
like that in your life?

314
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:03,560
- Bless you.
- Bless you. Come right on in.

315
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:09,320
Come right on in.
Hi, how are you?

316
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,600
- Hey, how's it going?
- OK.

317
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:34,760
Let's see what we've got.

318
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,920
Where are you?

319
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,240
Oh, there you are. Nice suit!

320
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,480
Guys!

321
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:50,360
Excuse me. Are you from Rustwater?

322
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:55,560
- No, I drove 30 miles to be here.
- 30 miles. That far?

323
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,360
- What is your name?
- Emma Schlarp.

324
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:02,440
I have a great seat
right in front of the preacher for you.

325
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,240
- Would you like to have it?
- Oh, yes.

326
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,080
Sit right here,
and I'll roll you down there.

327
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:12,240
That's very nice of you.

328
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,400
It's a much better view
and this chair's a lot softer.

329
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,440
Thank you.

330
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:21,480
It's nothing but trouble with that old man.

331
00:28:21,680 --> 00:28:26,040
He's got 80 yards of electrified fence
spitting distance to the house.

332
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:30,720
You know our kids play over there,
and somebody's gonna get hurt.

333
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:37,480
...loving Jesus gives you
a warm feeling in your stomach...

334
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:41,040
Guy in cowboy hat
says he loves Jesus.

335
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:44,520
Really? I thought
they were just good friends.

336
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,320
Make sure to hit him up personally.

337
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,280
Absolutely.

338
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,680
- You like it?
- Yeah.

339
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:53,720
Cut it out, Matt!

340
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,600
- You here alone?
- I'm with my mom.

341
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:01,520
If she catches me talking with you...
I gotta go, OK?

342
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,400
Can I see you after the show?

343
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,480
- OK. Nice to see you.
- You, too.

344
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,600
Girl in glitter jeans is pregnant.

345
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:16,200
Her mother's been beating her.
That's nice.

346
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,880
Where is she sitting?

347
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,640
Town's small, Jonas.
Don't mention she's knocked up.

348
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
I'll be good.

349
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,920
Did you study my summary?

350
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,200
Yeah. And the Grange ladies told me
who's been sleeping around.

351
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:37,240
Tiny, you got the smoke ready?

352
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:41,280
What's Roger doing?
Tell him five shills is enough.

353
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:44,360
Come on, the angels will see him.

354
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,880
What's the deal
with the cherry hat again?

355
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,480
Electric fence.
Visualise the fence with cherries on it.

356
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:56,880
- What do you like? This or this?
- Ready to check your receiver?

357
00:29:57,080 --> 00:30:00,240
I'm having an accessory crisis.

358
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,480
Testing sibilance, one, two.
Can you hear me?

359
00:30:03,680 --> 00:30:07,000
That's fine.
Boy, are you a tough room!

360
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,080
The dark grey, definitely.

361
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,600
You look gorgeous.

362
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,440
Always look better than they do, Janey.

363
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,440
And now, let's go give
some empty lives a little meaning!

364
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:23,800
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- Ready as I can be!

365
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:27,680
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- The spirit will set you free

366
00:30:27,880 --> 00:30:29,840
Are you ready? Are you ready?

367
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:41,600
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- Ready as I can be

368
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,640
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- The spirit will set you free

369
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,960
Are you ready for a miracle?

370
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:03,680
Be strong in the Lord
and in the power of his might!

371
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:09,320
Be strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

372
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,560
Put on the whole armour of God
that ye may be able to stand

373
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,840
against the wiles of the Devil!

374
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,840
Come on, Hoov. Goose 'em.
I got a cold audience out there.

375
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:23,720
Yes, I'm ready! Yeah!

376
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:28,640
I hear Satan knocking,
but he can't come in! Yes, sir!

377
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,320
Come on, people!

378
00:31:30,520 --> 00:31:34,200
Turn it loose,
let him fix it and let him in!

379
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,720
Take it down, angels.
I gotta talk to these people.

380
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,200
I gotta talk to these people a second.
I wanna tell you a story...

381
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,560
- This'll move you.
...about a man from New York.

382
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:50,040
A man named Thomas.

383
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:53,640
Now, Thomas lived on Fifth Avenue.

384
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,440
Views of Central Park
even from the bathroom!

385
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:01,280
Beautiful wife. Two sweet kids.

386
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:05,080
But his life was a mess.
You know why?

387
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,720
Because of the fear.

388
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,880
Afraid his business would fail.

389
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:14,920
Afraid his children would come to harm.

390
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:17,880
Afraid of balding
and his wife leaving him.

391
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:21,520
Afraid of death.
But death's a breeze.

392
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,120
Ever heard of anyone
coming back to complain? No!

393
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:30,080
- It's life that'll kill you...
- Matt, give your people a wake-up call.

394
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:32,840
...and Thomas was a prisoner of fear.

395
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,560
- Amen, Preacher!
- Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!

396
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:41,120
...he got a $2,000 hairpiece
and a world-class doctor.

397
00:32:41,320 --> 00:32:43,320
- But was Tom happy?
- No!

398
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,040
No! N-O.

399
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:51,200
Because when Thomas finally
came to me, he still had the fear.

400
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:57,840
The fear is bigger than doctors!
The fear is bigger than money!

401
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,560
- Absolutely!
- Amen!

402
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,480
There's only thing bigger
than the fear, my friends.

403
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:09,240
And that one thing... is the faith.

404
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,960
- Hallelujah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

405
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:14,560
Faith that the universe needs him!

406
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:17,920
Faith that his woman
loves his soul not his hair!

407
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:23,320
Faith that his children will be protected
not by a man with a.357 Magnum,

408
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:28,920
but by The Man with the super-charged
grenade launcher of love!

409
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:35,400
And that one man is one man
and one man only.

410
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,440
That man is Jesus Christ!

411
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,480
Yeah!

412
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:43,320
If you wanna feel happy,

413
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:46,920
if you wanna feel love,
all you gotta do...

414
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,520
If you wanna feel safe,
if you wanna feel strong,

415
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:54,040
if you wanna walk tall,
all you gotta do,

416
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:59,200
all you gotta do,
all you gotta do is get saved!

417
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,480
Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you, Jesus!

418
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,720
- Say "Hallelujah."
- Hallelujah!

419
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:12,320
- Looking good, Jo Jo.
- Holy juice pumps through my veins!

420
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,640
I feel a healing coming on.

421
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,000
But I need to know
you're on the side of the Lord.

422
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,800
I need a sign of your faith.

423
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,680
I'm not asking you to pay
for this beautiful music, no!

424
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:34,200
I'm not asking you to pay
for the word of God.

425
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:37,960
What I do need is
some token that you believe.

426
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:43,200
- How about that ruby ring?
- You belong to the most exclusive club!

427
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:47,280
A club that only God's
faithful and generous can join.

428
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:50,240
- Only then...
- Give me that ring!

429
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:53,600
No one can keep you
out of the kingdom of heaven!

430
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:58,040
- Tell her I'm gonna kill her!
- You're meat, baby.

431
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,680
OK, I'll be good!

432
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:03,920
They are going to pass among you.

433
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:08,360
- The more you give, the more you live!
- Praise the Lord, brother!

434
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:14,200
The Lord spoke to me tonight.
He's searching for some special people.

435
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:17,760
They'll receive great rewards
in material goods.

436
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:22,560
He wants these special people
to be saved here on stage with me!

437
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:27,160
It's sad out there, that's all I have to say.

438
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,200
It's burgers tonight.

439
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,280
Oh, people,
the Lord is speaking to me right now.

440
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:45,480
- It better be good.
- Relax. Cherry hat. Section 4, row F.

441
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:49,240
You, sir, in the brown jacket.
I feel your burden.

442
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,080
Who? Who, me?

443
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,840
Yes, sir. Tell me
if I'm hearing the Lord right.

444
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:59,000
- You've a problem with your neighbour?
- I sure have!

445
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,560
- That fence is going to harm your kids?
- Yes, sir!

446
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,520
Amazing!

447
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:08,760
...make him your friend,
serve him your best fried chicken!

448
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,400
- 'Cause yours is the best in the county.
- It is!

449
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:16,400
I'd love some of that.
Now thank the Lord for his saving!

450
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:24,400
Section 5, row A is the glitter jeans.
Remember glitter jeans?

451
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,440
Sister!

452
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,800
You're suffering deeply.
You're worried about your little girl.

453
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,000
- Yes, Reverend.
- Stand up.

454
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,400
The Lord says a strike unto any
of his children is a strike unto him.

455
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,680
Lord, I hear you. Please forgive me.

456
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:45,600
- Jesus forgives you. Say "Hallelujah!"
- Hallelujah!

457
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,440
Fishing cap, section 4, row F.

458
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,480
You, sir. Come up on stage
and be cured of your gambling!

459
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:05,560
That's incredible!
Section 1, pink mu-mu. She lost her job.

460
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:07,480
You, in the pink dress.

461
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:11,480
Receive the Lord
and you will find another job!

462
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,200
First row. White shirt. Back problem.

463
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:19,080
You, sir. Believe in the Lord
and cure your backache!

464
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:21,760
Same section, yellow shirt.
Hearing problem.

465
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,960
You, sir, come up on stage!

466
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,800
Hearing problem!

467
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:31,600
Section 2, the blue-haired lady.
She's got arthritis.

468
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,920
You, too, ma'am. Come up on stage!

469
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:39,280
- We're gonna help some people.
- Ah, we are!

470
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:49,080
- He's got trouble with his neighbours.
- Let him fix it! Let him in!

471
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:52,360
Hallelujah!

472
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:57,080
I'm feeling something tonight!

473
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:02,040
- He's got a sore neck.
- Receive the anointing in Jesus' name!

474
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,840
- Say, "Thank you, Jesus!"
- She needs a job.

475
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,320
You need a job?
Now you're working for Jesus!

476
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,160
- A gambling man.
- Get the strength in your life!

477
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:15,440
Holy name of Jesus!

478
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,280
- He can't hear a thing.
- Hear the word, hear the word!

479
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,520
In Jesus' holy name!

480
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:28,320
- Welcome to the kingdom of heaven.
- Arthritis.

481
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:32,080
Arthritis? Take the hand
of God's right-hand man.

482
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,600
Believe in the power of the Lord. Believe.

483
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,160
Raise your hands. Raise them up!

484
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,680
Wave your hands like this!

485
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:43,480
Thank you, Jesus!

486
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,000
Someone here's just been
cured of their asthma.

487
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:48,920
Hello, friend!

488
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,480
She's got bad bones, Reverend.

489
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,320
Hold it, hold it!

490
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:56,680
Take it down just a second.
Take it down.

491
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,240
We got someone special here.

492
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,600
- What's your name?
- Emma Schlarp.

493
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:04,760
- How long you had bone trouble?
- Years.

494
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:10,120
Well, God's gonna make
a miracle for you tonight.

495
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:13,400
O Lord, I'm just a man like any other,

496
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:18,240
but send a miracle through my hands
to help my sister Emma.

497
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:27,800
Come on, Emma.
Show me the power of the Lord.

498
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,080
Praise God. Praise God.

499
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,560
Praise God!

500
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,520
Thank you, Jesus. Come on, walk to me.

501
00:39:42,720 --> 00:39:44,840
Go on, Emma!

502
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,840
Yes! Yes!

503
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,400
It's a miracle! Hallelujah!

504
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:56,200
It's a miracle! Dance with me!

505
00:39:56,400 --> 00:40:00,880
Oh, say, "Thank you, Jesus."
Thank you, Jesus!

506
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:04,520
And I'm walking...

507
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:08,360
Highway up to heaven

508
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:10,880
No one can walk up there
But the pure in heart

509
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,960
It's a highway up to heaven

510
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:20,680
And I'm walking...
I'm so glad it's a highway up to heaven

511
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:24,360
You just can't walk up there
You got to be pure in heart

512
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:27,480
It's a highway up to heaven...

513
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,080
Thank you. Thank Jesus!

514
00:40:30,280 --> 00:40:32,840
In the name of Jesus!

515
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:06,080
- How did we do?
- About four grand.

516
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:18,240
Hey, Tony, I'm dressing!

517
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:22,080
Sorry, pal.

518
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:33,880
What's he doing here?

519
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,400
Well, well.
If it isn't my new best friend.

520
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:44,240
We've had the fire department,
the sanitation department.

521
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:46,880
What now? The Girl Scouts?

522
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:51,200
Nightengale, we both know
there's nothing I can do legally.

523
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,240
I'm here man to man.

524
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:58,400
Folks have lost their jobs, their land.
They can't feed their families.

525
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:01,760
So they sure can't afford
a con man like you.

526
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,400
Do a good thing. Pack it up.

527
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:12,000
That's some plain talk, Will.
So I'll give you a little in return.

528
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:14,920
- Good night, folks.
- Night, sir.

529
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:22,280
Let's assume I was
what you said I was.

530
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,400
In New York, they've got
Broadway shows costing $65 a pop

531
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:29,320
just to walk in the door.

532
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:36,040
Maybe you like the show.
Maybe you don't, and you kick yourself.

533
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:38,600
I give my people a good show,

534
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,000
plenty of music,
worthwhile sentiments.

535
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,880
Most of them go home
with a little hope in their lives.

536
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:51,120
Now, usually, I only play towns
that can afford me.

537
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,840
But what about towns like this
that really need me?

538
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:59,240
You don't care what these people need.
You're looking to cash in.

539
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:02,440
Oh, pissing contest! Can I watch?

540
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,440
- I won't just go away.
- Now, that sounds good!

541
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:16,280
'Cause you owe me that drink, Will.
Jonas, in the bus.

542
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:22,000
Will, what's that guy from
the sanitation department's name?

543
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:26,480
- Phil.
- Phil? I called him Frank. Anyway...

544
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,840
Come on, Janey! Wake up, baby!

545
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:48,920
God! It's eight o'clock!

546
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:52,560
I know what time it is.
I've been driving all night.

547
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,840
Wait till you see this. Close your eyes.

548
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:59,160
- They were closed.
- Come on, close them.

549
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,040
Pucker up.

550
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:03,840
Kiss. Big kiss.

551
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:08,240
Wow!

552
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,840
Hi! Where did you get him?

553
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:15,080
I found a breeder in Clydedale.
I convinced him to open late.

554
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,040
Ah, so let's hear it for insomnia.

555
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,160
I was worried about
your lack of companionship.

556
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:25,520
- What's his name?
- He's smart and hung like a moose.

557
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:28,800
- So I thought...
- Jack from Neptune!

558
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:32,280
- Come on!
- I know, Jonas Junior.

559
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:36,560
- Jonas! He's a good boy, too!
- He's great.

560
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:42,400
So here we'll make "such" as "drought",
"really" is "rain".

561
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:46,600
- And we'll make "won't" "tornadoes".
- OK, try me.

562
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:52,400
"Brother Jonas, I am wondering,
what question burns inside this woman."

563
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,280
If there'll be a twister
at her son's home in Wilmington.

564
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,560
- No, "wondering" is "Wichita".
- Wichita!

565
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,640
- I don't wanna do this audience tonight.
- Why? You're good.

566
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:08,600
- That's not the point.
- Relax. Pathos isn't contagious.

567
00:45:10,560 --> 00:45:15,000
Besides, the badge saw the set-up
last night. We can't take the chance.

568
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,000
- What did you two do after dinner?
- Nothing. I'm just greasing the wheels.

569
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,760
- Till one in the morning? A lot of grease.
- Your spies are slipping.

570
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:27,000
I was out till two.

571
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:31,680
You know how to play this, Jane.
Just watch your step!

572
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:39,400
Mr Nightengale, I'm so glad I caught you.

573
00:45:39,600 --> 00:45:42,000
I was at your meeting last night,

574
00:45:42,200 --> 00:45:46,200
and I heard what you said
to that family who lost their farm.

575
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:52,760
My husband lost his job, and
it's been hard putting food on the table.

576
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:57,080
Sorry to hear that. Come down tonight
and maybe I can help.

577
00:45:57,320 --> 00:46:00,480
Oh, heavens, it's not me.

578
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:06,080
The best way to forget your troubles
is to help someone else with theirs.

579
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:09,680
This is for that unfortunate family.

580
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:12,920
Will you see that they get it?

581
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,480
I certainly will.
That's mighty Christian of you.

582
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:18,640
Bless you.

583
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,520
You try it and you're toast!

584
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:35,040
You're gonna get it now!

585
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:49,360
Hey, Rev!
Looking for some souls to save?

586
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:54,760
You know me, I hate to see
even one get away. Souls, that is.

587
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,640
I brought you this. It's the best in town.

588
00:46:59,840 --> 00:47:03,000
- Hey, kid. How about a game?
- Da.

589
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,480
- I thought you had homework.
- I'll do it later.

590
00:47:06,680 --> 00:47:08,400
Little Russkie, huh?

591
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,320
I ever tell you I was
East Coast chess champion 1971?

592
00:47:15,600 --> 00:47:18,960
My sister's a total slave-driver.

593
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:24,400
- Go ahead and make your move.
- What do you think I just did?

594
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:27,200
That was a neat trick you did yesterday.

595
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:30,880
- The hand's quicker than the eye.
- So they tell me.

596
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,360
Nice move, kid.

597
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:45,760
Hey, Marva, could I have a thé glacé?

598
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:48,680
It's French for iced tea.

599
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:53,280
- Where's your church?
- On every street corner in every town.

600
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:58,600
- You don't have a church.
- I have a ministry, which is better.

601
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:01,440
My grandmother
used to take me with her.

602
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:06,200
So you believe in miracles, right?

603
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:09,760
Concentrate on your game, Boyd.

604
00:48:09,960 --> 00:48:13,760
I'd like to hear what your sister
has to say on the subject.

605
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:18,920
I believe in life, what it does to you
and what you do back.

606
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,960
Never underestimate the power of belief.

607
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:30,000
With it, I've seen a mute sing "Hallelujah"
and a cripple dance.

608
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,720
When you've got it, you've got the power
of every ocean in your hand.

609
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:38,960
Without it, you've got nothing.

610
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:44,640
Everyone is just another sinner,
and everywhere is just another hell.

611
00:48:52,560 --> 00:48:55,200
I'll be outside.

612
00:48:57,920 --> 00:49:02,800
- My sister thinks you're a fake.
- Maybe I am and maybe I'm not.

613
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:07,720
If I get the job done,
what difference does it make?

614
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:12,280
You're gonna need a miracle now,
because check and mate-ski!

615
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:27,520
This town is full of single women.
Leave me alone.

616
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:30,680
It must be your money.

617
00:49:34,120 --> 00:49:40,000
I've seen many people lie to themselves,
but they don't fool anyone.

618
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:43,400
Lying, huh?
Your personal area of expertise?

619
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:47,760
That's not true.
My talent is telling people the truth.

620
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,400
Like that picture on the wall in there.
Best day of your life.

621
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,080
- One of.
- Sure it was.

622
00:49:58,280 --> 00:50:01,240
You were young, you were free.

623
00:50:02,280 --> 00:50:05,520
You still had that spark in your eye.

624
00:50:05,720 --> 00:50:11,640
Now you hide out in that diner,
never letting anyone get next to you.

625
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,040
The last time you had a man
Nixon was in office.

626
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:20,080
How I live my life is none
of your business. What do you want?

627
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:23,680
I want to know how come you gave up.

628
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:32,960
A drunk truck driver did that.

629
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:38,240
Four hours stuck in a crash
watching our mom and dad die.

630
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:43,640
Doctors did all they could.
Took tests, stuck him with needles.

631
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:46,600
All for nothing.

632
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:49,560
So he had me take him to a preacher.

633
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,800
And the preacher got him up on stage.

634
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:56,880
When it was all over,
he was still on his crutches.

635
00:50:57,080 --> 00:50:59,680
Know what he said to my little brother?

636
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,920
He said that it was his fault,

637
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,320
'cause his faith wasn't strong enough.

638
00:51:06,520 --> 00:51:08,720
Let me tell you something.

639
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:11,960
All that boy has is faith.

640
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:16,600
The last thing he needs is
another phoney messing him up.

641
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,360
And the last thing I need is another man
using him to get me into bed.

642
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:27,760
Hey, Rev, how about a rematch?

643
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,200
Sorry, kid, I gotta go.

644
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,680
Can't stand the heat, huh?

645
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:36,160
Got it in one, kid.

646
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:51,080
If I pick it too soon, it won't sweeten.

647
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,240
If I leave it on the stock too long,
it rots on the way to market.

648
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:00,680
Too much rain turns it mouldy,
too little and it's hog-feed.

649
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:02,680
Timing's everything.

650
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:04,840
Same as in my business.

651
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:08,000
You gotta pick 'em while they're ripe.

652
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:12,320
Will, I know you think I'm crooked,
so why'd you ask me here?

653
00:52:12,520 --> 00:52:15,800
Well, you know those programmes

654
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,560
where they take delinquents
out to the woods and rehabilitate them?

655
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,640
- This isn't the woods.
- Smart girl.

656
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,480
I knew you were worth saving.

657
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:34,560
You've too much going for you
to be somebody's front man.

658
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,920
OK, guys, let's go!

659
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:09,280
Pick it up!

660
00:53:11,120 --> 00:53:12,640
- Hey, Rev.
- Hey, kid.

661
00:53:12,840 --> 00:53:14,560
Watch.

662
00:53:16,680 --> 00:53:20,280
My dad used to lift weights.
He was state champion.

663
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,640
- Great, comrade. You gonna compete?
- Yeah, all events done sitting down!

664
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:29,200
It's something I gotta do.
You have anything like that?

665
00:53:29,400 --> 00:53:33,280
Something I gotta do?
No, I stick with what I wanna do.

666
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:37,040
It's a tough policy, but it works for me.

667
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,040
Do you always jog in a cowboy hat?

668
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,400
I used to jog in my boots.

669
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:50,200
What did the doctors tell you?

670
00:53:50,400 --> 00:53:54,760
Doctors have nothing to do with my leg.
I'll walk if it's God's will.

671
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:58,920
Listen, God doesn't have
a trucker's licence.

672
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:01,560
You think you were chosen to suffer?

673
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,560
If you've done everything you can,
doctors, therapy, that's great.

674
00:54:06,760 --> 00:54:12,360
But if you haven't, get off your ass,
'cause God won't do it for you.

675
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:17,640
Look, kid,
everybody's a loser one of these days.

676
00:54:17,880 --> 00:54:21,120
The trick is not acting like a loser.

677
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:25,040
I believe things happen for a reason.

678
00:54:25,240 --> 00:54:28,920
Fine. You wanna believe that?
That's great.

679
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,280
I'm gonna run.

680
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:14,120
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I'm worried about that two-man code.

681
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:17,800
Maybe. But that's not why you're late.

682
00:55:18,000 --> 00:55:20,160
These are for me?

683
00:55:25,040 --> 00:55:27,840
Can I read it?

684
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:32,480
Gidget goes dustbowl.
Fine, have your little secret.

685
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,440
Will said he's got a surprise for you.

686
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:40,120
Something about
giving you enough rope.

687
00:55:40,320 --> 00:55:43,000
Tell him to go kick some shit!

688
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,200
There's not enough rope in Kansas
to hang me.

689
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:50,200
Besides, wait till you see the pitch.

690
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,680
Got a little surprise

691
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,640
myself.

692
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:01,880
Jesus is on the mainline
Tell him what you want

693
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:10,040
- Lord Jesus
- Tell him what you want

694
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,520
You gotta call him up
And tell him what you want

695
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:17,200
Call him up, call him up...

696
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,280
You tell him!

697
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:41,120
Am I in white boy heaven
or what? Yes!

698
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:43,560
That was beautiful, children.

699
00:56:43,760 --> 00:56:45,760
Children? Hm!

700
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:49,440
I want to tell you about myself.

701
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:53,880
You look at me and you see a man
who seems a lot like you.

702
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:57,360
But all my life I've been different.

703
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:00,320
At first, it was a curse,

704
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:05,080
but soon I discovered
the blessing of my birth.

705
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:09,880
Now, what was it, you ask,
made me different?

706
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:13,080
In an isolated cabin
in the Appalachian mountains,

707
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:17,760
Jonas Nightengale was born
with a caul about his face.

708
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:21,360
He told me his father invented Teflon.

709
00:57:21,560 --> 00:57:24,240
Some say the caul's an old wives' tale,

710
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:27,600
but I've seen some
smart old wives in my day!

711
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,720
They say a baby born with a caul
is given the second sight.

712
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:35,720
The sight inside a man's soul.

713
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,320
Hallelujah!

714
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,480
Sister Jane will pass among you...

715
00:57:40,680 --> 00:57:43,920
...and I want you
to ask her your questions.

716
00:57:44,160 --> 00:57:47,240
I'm going to reach deep inside

717
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:51,360
to find an answer
placed there by God.

718
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:57,040
- What can Jonas do for you tonight?
- How much longer do I have?

719
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,000
Brother Nightengale,

720
00:57:59,240 --> 00:58:03,280
can you tell me the answer
to our brother's question?

721
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,160
I'm hearing the voice of angels.

722
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:11,000
- He's worried how long he has to go.
- Praise be!

723
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:16,600
Whether you've ten years or ten minutes,
what matters is that you really live!

724
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,640
So when God's chariot arrives,
you're ready to step on board!

725
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:25,600
- Yes, sir!
- I've been widowed about a year.

726
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:31,200
When they repossessed the farm,
my husband killed himself in the barn.

727
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:37,480
Has the Lord forgiven him
and welcomed him to heaven?

728
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,800
Our sister would sincerely
like to know about a loved one.

729
00:58:43,400 --> 00:58:46,240
I'll give you your answer, sister.

730
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:50,040
He rests with the angels.
He says God has forgiven him.

731
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,600
He asks you to do the same.

732
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:57,160
When's it gonna rain?

733
00:58:58,200 --> 00:59:02,360
This man's question is really important.

734
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:05,360
Oh, boy.

735
00:59:06,680 --> 00:59:12,320
You want to know what every man
and woman in this tent wants to know.

736
00:59:12,520 --> 00:59:16,280
- You want to know when's it gonna rain!
- Yes! Yes!

737
00:59:16,480 --> 00:59:19,800
Let me ask you this question:
What is rain anyway?

738
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:24,080
Is it the sweet nectar your crops crave?
Is it tears of joy?

739
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:27,920
Or is it the rain that falls on every life?

740
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:34,040
The dressing down from your boss?
The bank pounding on the door?

741
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:38,320
When you say to me,
"Jonas, when's it gonna rain?"

742
00:59:38,520 --> 00:59:41,120
All I can say is...

743
00:59:42,360 --> 00:59:45,560
"When's it gonna stop?"

744
00:59:46,720 --> 00:59:50,320
In the Book of Osalms,
Chapter 27 reads as thus:

745
00:59:50,520 --> 00:59:56,160
"The Lord is my light and my salvation:
Of whom shall I fear?"

746
00:59:56,360 --> 01:00:02,560
The Lord is my light and my salvation

747
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,840
The Lord is the strength!

748
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:08,600
The Lord is my strength!
The Lord is your strength!

749
01:00:08,800 --> 01:00:11,600
The Lord is the strength of my life!

750
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:16,240
Strength of my life
Of whom shall I be...

751
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:21,520
Afraid...

752
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:42,680
I feel a healing coming on.

753
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:47,000
- How many love Jesus?
- Yeah!

754
01:00:47,240 --> 01:00:50,440
Are you ready for a miracle?

755
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:03,360
There it is, the word of God!
Yakety-yak, God's talking back!

756
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:06,600
- Hey, brother!
- Amen!

757
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,400
Whoa, people!

758
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,360
Oh! Hallelujah, sister!

759
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:14,240
Praise Jesus!
You're a slave in the spirit!

760
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:18,400
Receive the holy anointing of Jesus!
Let Jesus fix it!

761
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,200
- Somebody run!
- Me?

762
01:01:21,440 --> 01:01:25,400
You, feel the power of the Lord!
Celebrate the Lord!

763
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,000
Celebrate the Lord!

764
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,320
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

765
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:34,200
Praise Jesus! Praise Jesus!

766
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,680
You're not gonna need this any longer.
I cast out your chains!

767
01:01:42,560 --> 01:01:45,880
The sign of the cross! Look!

768
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,840
He's in the room! He's alive!

769
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:51,000
He's in me, he's in you!

770
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,080
I see him in your eyes!
I feel him beating in your hearts!

771
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,760
Reach up and touch Jesus!
Nice to see you again, sister.

772
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:03,320
Praise Jesus, praise his name!
Praise the Lord!

773
01:02:03,520 --> 01:02:08,040
Receive his holy name!
Say "Hallelujah!"

774
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:13,280
I've never seen a room so full of God!
Say, "Thank you, Jesus!"

775
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,480
- Somebody say "Amen."
- Amen!

776
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,160
Hey!

777
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:26,960
Hey!

778
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:33,560
Wait a minute, Reverend.
I want to testify.

779
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:44,520
I said I want to testify.

780
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:46,920
So speak up, Sheriff.

781
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:53,960
Before you leave your
hard-earned money in those buckets,

782
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:56,960
I want you to know where it's going.

783
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,800
Alias Jonas Nightengale,
born Jack Newton,

784
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:03,400
does not come from the Appalachians.

785
01:03:03,600 --> 01:03:06,040
He was born in the Bronx.

786
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:10,360
The closest he came to a church
was the Mary and Joseph Orphanage,

787
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:13,400
where he lived from five to fifteen.

788
01:03:13,600 --> 01:03:18,520
Then he ran away to begin a life
of crime, including convictions for...

789
01:03:20,360 --> 01:03:21,840
...shoplifting,

790
01:03:22,040 --> 01:03:26,040
possession of marijuana
and grand theft auto,

791
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,120
all before the age of 18.

792
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:34,600
He was arrested for selling fraudulent
art works and passing bad cheques.

793
01:03:34,800 --> 01:03:39,760
If you feel you've had a good night's
entertainment, then go ahead,

794
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:41,680
tip the dancing bear.

795
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:47,080
But, if you think this money's
going to a man of God,

796
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:50,240
you'd better think again.

797
01:03:50,440 --> 01:03:51,840
I believe in Jonas.

798
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,160
He's a fake!

799
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:13,560
There ain't no way he's a man of God!

800
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,840
Brother Will!

801
01:04:30,040 --> 01:04:33,840
Everything you've said is true.
Absolutely true.

802
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,280
Yes, I was born to lowly circumstances.

803
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:47,440
Yes, I ran with a bad crowd that
taught me to smoke weed and steal.

804
01:04:48,480 --> 01:04:50,960
I hung out in bars.

805
01:04:52,560 --> 01:04:54,920
And I hot-wired cars.

806
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:59,880
I grew up mistreated,
so I lied and I cheated.

807
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:05,120
I learned hard crime
and I served hard time.

808
01:05:05,320 --> 01:05:09,520
I have walked that crooked road
and I have danced with Satan.

809
01:05:09,720 --> 01:05:13,840
I've been down in the gutter
and looked up into the face of God.

810
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:16,640
- Praise the Lord!
- Amen!

811
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:20,280
I say to you,
if you wanna give up the bottle,

812
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,760
who you gonna talk to?

813
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,800
- Someone who's never touched a drop?
- No!

814
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:29,720
If you wanna give up womanising,
who you gonna talk to?

815
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,480
- Some pale-skinned virgin priest?
- No!

816
01:05:33,720 --> 01:05:36,320
If you wanna give up sin -

817
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:41,720
and I believe everyone here tonight
wants to give up sin -

818
01:05:41,920 --> 01:05:43,600
who can lead you?

819
01:05:43,800 --> 01:05:45,880
You need a real sinner, people.

820
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:51,120
A sinner of such monumental
proportions that all your sins

821
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:55,080
couldn't possibly equal
the sins of this King of Sin!

822
01:05:56,960 --> 01:06:00,480
Because you know,
if he can walk that righteous path,

823
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:04,600
if he can go from grift to grace,
from sin to sanctity,

824
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,240
from lowliness to holiness,

825
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:11,880
that you, with all your everyday sins,

826
01:06:12,080 --> 01:06:15,160
can rise up like an angel

827
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,600
and ride that golden elevator
to God's own penthouse in the sky.

828
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,960
Hey, Jake! Jake Bradley!

829
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:32,400
The bank gave you
last warning on foreclosure.

830
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:34,960
How much did you put in the bucket?

831
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,600
$10.

832
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:39,480
Sadie McElroy,

833
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:43,960
you've got two boys in junior college,
your husband's out of work.

834
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:48,440
I put in 20, Will.
I need all the help I can get.

835
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,360
Amen!

836
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:55,200
I don't know what to say to you.

837
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:58,560
You folks have been warned.

838
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:06,640
Sadie, you need all the help you can get.
You, too, Jake. All of you.

839
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:09,760
I know what you're going through.

840
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:12,560
But there can be no price on salvation.

841
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:17,440
So I want you to take back
all your money, every last cent.

842
01:07:17,640 --> 01:07:24,520
Bring those buckets out.
Sadie take out twenty; Jake take out ten.

843
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,960
Go ahead.

844
01:07:27,160 --> 01:07:30,960
Because the Lord knows
you still have doubt in your hearts.

845
01:07:31,160 --> 01:07:34,600
Without your faith,
I cannot deliver the Word.

846
01:07:34,800 --> 01:07:38,400
- Praise the Lord!
- For the Israelites, he parted the sea.

847
01:07:38,600 --> 01:07:41,120
To Moses,
he spoke from the burning bush.

848
01:07:41,320 --> 01:07:45,840
And in your hour of doubt,
the Lord has spoken to me.

849
01:07:46,880 --> 01:07:49,200
He said, "Jonas,

850
01:07:49,400 --> 01:07:54,000
"Jonas, expect a sign."

851
01:07:55,320 --> 01:08:01,240
And if God's wisdom is proven to you,
then may you support this ministry.

852
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:04,760
Because God don't want
no doubt money, no!

853
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:07,560
And I don't want no doubt money. N-O!

854
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:13,400
Because doubt money burned the fingers
of the righteous, and I will not be burned!

855
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:25,440
- You all right?
- Of course.

856
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:29,080
Plant the twenties
before they leave.

857
01:08:33,120 --> 01:08:35,800
He'll be all right.

858
01:08:39,320 --> 01:08:42,280
It's a highway up to heaven

859
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:45,800
You just can't walk up there
You've got to have a pure heart

860
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:52,400
It's a highway up to heaven...

861
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:25,120
Look, Jane...

862
01:09:25,360 --> 01:09:28,760
Try grovelling.
It goes a long way with me.

863
01:09:30,120 --> 01:09:35,600
- I told you I had a job to do.
- Doing your job is one thing.

864
01:09:35,800 --> 01:09:39,600
Trying to destroy
a human being is another.

865
01:09:39,840 --> 01:09:42,400
Nuclear winter wouldn't destroy him!

866
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,560
Oh, yeah?

867
01:09:44,760 --> 01:09:48,240
Let me tell you something
your snooping didn't turn up.

868
01:09:48,480 --> 01:09:52,560
Do you know
how he landed in that orphanage?

869
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:57,840
- I assume his parents died.
- His parents?

870
01:09:58,040 --> 01:10:00,440
God only knows where his father is.

871
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,480
His mother took him out
shopping one day.

872
01:10:03,680 --> 01:10:08,120
Told him she'd be right back and
that he should wait on the corner.

873
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:12,560
Four days later, he's there waiting.

874
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,800
So the cops lug him off
to Our Mother of Neglect,

875
01:10:16,000 --> 01:10:20,640
where, for five years, he still believes
his mother will come to get him.

876
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:23,440
Finally, he just wised up.

877
01:10:23,680 --> 01:10:28,680
- The jails are full of stories like that.
- Yeah. They sure are.

878
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:31,680
That's why,
if Jonas was wearing pantyhose

879
01:10:31,880 --> 01:10:35,640
and pointing a rifle,
it wouldn't surprise me.

880
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:37,920
But he's not.

881
01:10:38,120 --> 01:10:42,360
All he's doing is selling fairy tales
to people who thank him.

882
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:45,880
The last thing he needs is
a judgemental asshole like you

883
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:48,520
throwing his past up in his face.

884
01:12:39,200 --> 01:12:42,440
Open up, boss. It's me.

885
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,040
This better be good.

886
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:02,560
Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me.

887
01:13:02,760 --> 01:13:04,880
Pardon me. Excuse me.

888
01:13:05,080 --> 01:13:06,920
Excuse me.

889
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:13,480
The Reverend has just arrived.

890
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:23,320
God bless you, Father.

891
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:27,520
Praise the Lord!

892
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,680
Praise the Lord! His eyes are open!

893
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:49,760
You've outdone yourself.

894
01:13:49,960 --> 01:13:53,920
He preached last night
that God would send a sign.

895
01:13:54,120 --> 01:13:56,080
I've seen a hundred signs.

896
01:13:56,280 --> 01:14:01,760
A magnificent sunrise, a green light
when I thought it would turn red.

897
01:14:02,000 --> 01:14:04,720
But never have I seen anything like this.

898
01:14:04,920 --> 01:14:10,000
You were watching the tent last night.
Anybody switch crucifixes?

899
01:14:10,240 --> 01:14:13,200
No, sir. Not a soul.

900
01:14:19,880 --> 01:14:22,200
Praise the Lord! It's a miracle!

901
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,840
Hallelujah!

902
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:43,320
An alleged miracle in Rustwater,
whose population of 22,000

903
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:48,800
in the last few hours
has swelled to over 31,000 people.

904
01:15:39,360 --> 01:15:41,960
Rumour has it
the crucifix performs miracles.

905
01:15:42,200 --> 01:15:48,000
A local man who sustained a burn said
his wound had miraculously healed.

906
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:52,560
- The question is...
- What are we doing about the rain?

907
01:15:52,760 --> 01:15:58,280
Tony's printing some pamphlets
on rainmaking so we'll use them.

908
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:01,560
There'll be some really
sick people there.

909
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:04,640
Seat them in the back
away from the stage.

910
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:09,920
And we have our malpractice insurance:
"Only if your faith is strong enough."

911
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:14,000
- Damn, this was a new shirt.
- Have you tried turpentine?

912
01:16:14,200 --> 01:16:17,400
It's no good.
That trick's worth it, though.

913
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:19,320
An oldie but goodie.

914
01:16:19,520 --> 01:16:23,520
- Have you had any sleep lately?
- Too busy to sleep.

915
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:27,040
Places to go and people to do.

916
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,680
How's the badge taking all this?

917
01:16:32,880 --> 01:16:35,760
I heard he couldn't get
an art expert till Tuesday.

918
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:41,480
You heard? Little lovers' tiff?
Wonder how he got so well-informed.

919
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:46,840
Screw you.
I'm not the one giving out free samples.

920
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:53,440
I just feel bad is all,
these people are so broke.

921
01:16:53,640 --> 01:16:57,720
You feel bad for the poor people
but you want their money.

922
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,760
What's a girl to do?

923
01:17:00,960 --> 01:17:05,320
Move to Kansas?
Marry old Will and slop the hogs?

924
01:17:05,520 --> 01:17:07,880
You can't have it both ways.

925
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:12,160
I don't believe I defended you.
I'm tired of manipulators.

926
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:15,640
Manipulators are sneaky. I'm obvious.

927
01:17:15,840 --> 01:17:17,280
And right!

928
01:17:30,040 --> 01:17:33,200
You feeling better now?

929
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:37,840
Yeah. I guess I just needed to be alone.

930
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:43,560
I'll take that as a compliment.

931
01:17:46,760 --> 01:17:50,920
- It's before six. I've gotta go.
- Whoa!

932
01:17:52,400 --> 01:17:54,920
Places to go, people to rip off.

933
01:17:55,160 --> 01:17:58,760
Oh, you should talk.
You're consorting with the enemy.

934
01:17:59,000 --> 01:18:02,440
Well, I'm an easy consort.

935
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:14,240
You ever think about settling down?

936
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,760
My mother taught me never to settle.

937
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:24,800
You're fast on your feet, Jane,
but someday you may wanna slow down.

938
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,600
No.

939
01:18:26,800 --> 01:18:29,640
Sorry, Will. I don't do slow.

940
01:18:34,000 --> 01:18:37,600
Come on. I want to show you something.

941
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:44,240
They travel over two thousand miles
and end up here,

942
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:47,680
back with the same mate,
year after year.

943
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:51,560
What are you talking about?
I don't see anything.

944
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,480
They started arriving last week.
There's only a few thousand right now.

945
01:18:56,680 --> 01:19:00,000
What started arriving?
I don't see anything.

946
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:01,880
Watch.

947
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:23,680
Ain't they beautiful?

948
01:19:26,160 --> 01:19:29,360
- Oh, they like me.
- Fantastic!

949
01:19:32,760 --> 01:19:38,520
Jane, I'm not a flashy guy,
but what I promise I deliver.

950
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,640
- I'd like to make you some promises.
- You've known me three days!

951
01:19:44,840 --> 01:19:47,640
I'm a quick study.

952
01:19:55,320 --> 01:19:58,280
By Tuesday, you'll be gone.

953
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:01,360
If I had more time, I'd take it.

954
01:20:12,560 --> 01:20:15,320
Why don't you come tonight?
Lt'll be fun.

955
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,480
The crew has a bet going.

956
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:21,440
Everybody had to come up
with some ridiculous word.

957
01:20:21,680 --> 01:20:27,120
Jonas has to work them into his sermon,
and if he fails, you win the pot.

958
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:29,480
Guess what my phrase is.

959
01:20:29,680 --> 01:20:32,360
Aluminum siding.

960
01:20:32,560 --> 01:20:35,000
Aluminum siding!

961
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:38,360
You can get caught up in the frills of life!

962
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,960
Samsonite luggage,
the Amana washer.

963
01:20:41,200 --> 01:20:44,520
But you know
what's really important, don't you?

964
01:20:44,720 --> 01:20:46,600
Are you ready for the truth?

965
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,800
Are you ready for the Word?

966
01:20:49,040 --> 01:20:51,760
We gotta get back
to that old-time religion.

967
01:20:51,960 --> 01:20:53,760
Where is she?

968
01:20:55,640 --> 01:21:00,640
All right. What if I told you
one good deed returns ten good ones?

969
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:02,480
Would you believe me?

970
01:21:02,720 --> 01:21:07,240
If I told you that one righteous day
would return ten days of fortune?

971
01:21:07,440 --> 01:21:09,200
Would you believe me?

972
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:14,200
What if I told you $1 in the service
of the Lord would return ten-fold?

973
01:21:14,400 --> 01:21:17,000
- Would you believe me?
- Yes!

974
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:21,640
- Yo, I'm here.
- It's about time... for a miracle!

975
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:27,000
- I believe, brother, I believe!
- What is it? Come up here.

976
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,000
- What's your name?
- Calvin Tweedy.

977
01:21:31,200 --> 01:21:32,480
Go ahead.

978
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:39,200
Last night, I only had $10 in my wallet
and my wife Kate made me give it all.

979
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,320
God bless you, Kate!

980
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:44,360
Then you said to take it back and I did.

981
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:49,840
But this morning I had $30,
and I had no $20 bill before that.

982
01:21:50,040 --> 01:21:52,480
Well, hallelujah! It's a miracle!

983
01:21:52,680 --> 01:21:55,640
- It happened to me, too!
- I got 40!

984
01:21:55,840 --> 01:22:00,920
Hallelujah, it's a miracle!
Turn it loose, Bruce, and get back, Jack!

985
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:05,000
Rustwater, Kansas,
is some kind of holy town.

986
01:22:05,200 --> 01:22:10,000
I've never seen such a demonstration
of the Lord's plenty. Say, "Amen!"

987
01:22:10,200 --> 01:22:12,680
Say, "Hallelujah!"

988
01:22:12,880 --> 01:22:16,760
All right, let's give some empty lives
a little meaning!

989
01:22:19,760 --> 01:22:22,360
I believe we'll see
some miracles tonight.

990
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,080
Come on up,
I'm working for Jesus!

991
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:30,000
He's coming through me,
special delivery! Hallelujah!

992
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:36,760
A fever is on me! A fever is on me!

993
01:22:36,960 --> 01:22:39,480
Do you hear him call?

994
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,680
Fall into the spirit of Jesus Christ!

995
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:47,520
Prepare to receive your miracle!

996
01:22:48,840 --> 01:22:52,760
Oh, I'm feeling the power tonight!
I'm feeling the power!

997
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:55,000
Invite him in, sisters!

998
01:22:55,200 --> 01:22:58,840
Somebody has just
been cured of their rheumatism.

999
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:02,720
Receive a fresh anointing!
Watch out, I'm vibrating!

1000
01:23:02,920 --> 01:23:06,560
I'm vibrating, I'm vibrating with Jesus!

1001
01:23:08,040 --> 01:23:10,880
I'm feeling the power!
Come on, brother!

1002
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:14,880
Let Jesus in.
He's speaking the language of the Lord!

1003
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:18,560
The language of the Lord! Hallelujah!

1004
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:21,920
Fall into Jesus!

1005
01:23:22,120 --> 01:23:24,840
The Angels of Mercy!

1006
01:23:25,040 --> 01:23:27,760
I'm boxing for Jesus!

1007
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,080
This room is burning up
with the fever of the Lord!

1008
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,920
Hallelujah, brother!

1009
01:23:34,920 --> 01:23:37,320
Hey, Reverend. Hey, Rev!

1010
01:23:37,520 --> 01:23:41,040
Hey, Rev, what about me?

1011
01:23:42,760 --> 01:23:45,240
I've no more healing power left in me.

1012
01:23:45,480 --> 01:23:48,840
- Rev, what about me?
- That's it!

1013
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:53,640
I'm all done in from the service
to the Lord! Thank you, Jesus!

1014
01:23:53,840 --> 01:23:58,600
Dance, brother, dance!
Celebrate the miracles of the Lord!

1015
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,960
- Another one!
- What about Boyd?

1016
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,000
One more! One more!

1017
01:24:09,680 --> 01:24:11,800
So glad you could make it.

1018
01:24:12,040 --> 01:24:15,760
I had to cold read 20 people
and I was not brilliant.

1019
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:18,240
One more! One more!

1020
01:24:18,440 --> 01:24:21,520
I think you've got a little problem here.

1021
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:24,160
One more! One more!

1022
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:28,920
Take it from me, babe,
you can't have it both ways.

1023
01:24:29,120 --> 01:24:31,800
One more! One more!

1024
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,880
One more! One more!

1025
01:24:45,000 --> 01:24:47,520
One more! One more!

1026
01:24:47,720 --> 01:24:50,680
One more! One more!

1027
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:03,760
Hallelujah!

1028
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:15,320
You asked for one more demonstration
of the Lord's kindness, a show of faith.

1029
01:25:15,520 --> 01:25:20,000
It's about faith. You gotta have it
or you can't get healed.

1030
01:25:20,240 --> 01:25:24,800
If there's any doubt in your hearts,
the Lord cannot deliver.

1031
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:29,960
Even if one of you doubts, like you,
Will. I know you have doubts.

1032
01:25:30,160 --> 01:25:35,000
You must believe, because this boy's
chances of walking are in your hands.

1033
01:25:35,200 --> 01:25:36,520
Amen!

1034
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:40,920
Brothers and sisters,
I ask you to consider

1035
01:26:41,120 --> 01:26:45,760
the fate of an innocent
rests in the heart of a cynic.

1036
01:27:22,360 --> 01:27:25,400
You can do it. You can do it.

1037
01:27:26,120 --> 01:27:28,440
Release your faith!

1038
01:27:56,200 --> 01:27:58,600
Hallelujah! Another miracle!

1039
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:01,760
Have faith in Jesus! Faith in Jesus!

1040
01:28:12,240 --> 01:28:14,920
- Amen!
- Hallelujah!

1041
01:28:29,520 --> 01:28:32,360
How did you do it, Reverend?

1042
01:28:33,920 --> 01:28:35,440
Son of a bitch!

1043
01:29:05,320 --> 01:29:08,920
Are you gonna tell me
what really happened out there?

1044
01:29:09,120 --> 01:29:11,840
I've been had. I've been hustled.

1045
01:29:12,040 --> 01:29:14,240
What are you talking about?

1046
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:17,240
They got a great act,
the waitress and Tiny Tim!

1047
01:29:17,440 --> 01:29:21,200
That story about the trucker,
a drunken trucker.

1048
01:29:21,400 --> 01:29:26,120
- Details, the mark of a great con!
- Forget it. Not those two.

1049
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:29,080
They're not like you.

1050
01:29:30,400 --> 01:29:32,200
Come on.

1051
01:29:32,400 --> 01:29:35,840
Remember me?
I'm Jane, your partner in crime.

1052
01:29:36,040 --> 01:29:39,160
Did you see them?
They're going out of their minds.

1053
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:42,800
I had to clear the tent
or they'd have torn it down.

1054
01:29:43,000 --> 01:29:47,400
- You should see the money coming in.
- By this time tomorrow...

1055
01:29:47,600 --> 01:29:50,080
...we're gonna be on every TV station.

1056
01:29:50,280 --> 01:29:55,000
- We can play New Orleans...
- Tell me the truth.

1057
01:29:55,200 --> 01:29:59,400
What is this,
an elaborate set-up or what?

1058
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:01,680
What do you think?

1059
01:30:03,000 --> 01:30:05,040
Holy shit!

1060
01:30:05,240 --> 01:30:09,520
Jonas, I gotta hand it to you.
Getting that kid was genius!

1061
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:14,760
Give that kid a haircut,
put him in some fancy clothes on stage!

1062
01:30:14,960 --> 01:30:18,480
- That's money in the bank!
- Maybe he can re-enact it.

1063
01:30:18,680 --> 01:30:22,320
Do you know what we could bring in
in Dallas in one week?

1064
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,840
Seven figures!

1065
01:30:24,040 --> 01:30:29,040
Seven figures, man!
Jonas, man, what do you think?

1066
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:36,000
Come on, Jonas.

1067
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:44,720
- Do it!
- You're a genius, man!

1068
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:46,200
Genius!

1069
01:30:47,200 --> 01:30:48,480
Jonas, wait!

1070
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:52,920
Listen. We made a lot of money
and until now it's been great.

1071
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:56,480
- But this is different.
- Come on, Jane.

1072
01:30:56,680 --> 01:30:59,880
No! That is not one of our shills in there.

1073
01:31:00,120 --> 01:31:02,720
I don't know what,
but something happened.

1074
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:07,000
- You're right about that.
- You can't take this away from him.

1075
01:31:07,200 --> 01:31:12,040
- You can't make him into a sideshow.
- You think not?

1076
01:31:12,240 --> 01:31:17,600
Wow! You really don't give a shit
about anybody, do you?

1077
01:31:17,800 --> 01:31:20,600
Janey, I never pretended I did.

1078
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:23,320
God, you're right.

1079
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:27,480
You never did.
You still don't care who you hurt.

1080
01:31:27,680 --> 01:31:29,840
See how this feels.

1081
01:31:35,680 --> 01:31:37,280
Jane!

1082
01:31:39,920 --> 01:31:41,960
Janey!

1083
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:21,080
Hey, boss.

1084
01:32:22,720 --> 01:32:25,600
Remember me? Jack Newton.

1085
01:32:26,680 --> 01:32:28,760
Got a question for you.

1086
01:32:30,640 --> 01:32:34,040
Why did you make so many suckers?

1087
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:51,120
You say, "Love never endeth."

1088
01:32:51,320 --> 01:32:54,520
Well, I say, "Love never starteth!"

1089
01:32:54,720 --> 01:32:56,880
"The meek shall inherit the earth."

1090
01:32:57,080 --> 01:33:00,120
The meek just get
the short end of the stick!

1091
01:33:00,320 --> 01:33:04,400
You say, "Is anyone pure of heart?"
I say, "Not one!"

1092
01:33:04,640 --> 01:33:06,600
Rev?

1093
01:33:12,240 --> 01:33:14,320
Hello, Boyd.

1094
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:19,200
Why aren't you out
signing autographs? Or dancing?

1095
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:23,280
I need to ask you a question.

1096
01:33:25,760 --> 01:33:28,960
I wanted to know
when you planned to leave town.

1097
01:33:29,160 --> 01:33:32,560
Leave? A couple of days, I guess.

1098
01:33:37,440 --> 01:33:41,360
Well, I wanted to know
if I could go with you.

1099
01:33:42,440 --> 01:33:45,920
- Well...
- I can do things. I'll earn my keep.

1100
01:33:47,640 --> 01:33:51,680
You're too old
to be running away with the circus.

1101
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:54,400
No, it's not that.

1102
01:33:54,600 --> 01:34:00,280
Look, you made me walk again.
Many people tried that, but they couldn't.

1103
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:04,760
Hold it, kid.
I had nothing to do with you walking.

1104
01:34:04,960 --> 01:34:06,560
Sure you did.

1105
01:34:06,800 --> 01:34:12,680
I run a show here. A lot of smoke
and noise strictly for the suckers!

1106
01:34:12,880 --> 01:34:16,000
I've been pulling scams
since I was your age.

1107
01:34:16,200 --> 01:34:20,480
If there's one thing I know,
it's how to spot the genuine article.

1108
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:23,200
That's what you gotta watch out for.

1109
01:34:23,400 --> 01:34:28,160
Not the cops.
You can always get around the cops.

1110
01:34:28,360 --> 01:34:32,360
But what you can never get around
is the genuine article.

1111
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:36,320
And you, kid, are the genuine article.

1112
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:42,480
- Are you saying you think you're a fake?
- I know I'm a fake.

1113
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:47,440
What difference does it make,
if you get the job done?

1114
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:52,640
Kid, it makes
all the difference in the world.

1115
01:34:55,680 --> 01:34:57,320
Boyd?

1116
01:35:02,360 --> 01:35:04,920
Everyone's looking for you.

1117
01:35:05,160 --> 01:35:06,440
OK.

1118
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:11,080
Well, what do you think?

1119
01:35:12,720 --> 01:35:15,000
All right, kid, I'll tell you what.

1120
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:19,280
I'll meet you in front of the diner
at ten in the morning.

1121
01:35:27,720 --> 01:35:30,160
So I'll see you then?

1122
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:36,680
I'll be back in a minute.

1123
01:35:43,400 --> 01:35:46,080
I want to thank you.

1124
01:35:47,160 --> 01:35:50,040
I don't know why my brother's walking,

1125
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,880
but I'll be grateful for the rest of my life.

1126
01:35:59,920 --> 01:36:01,760
Marva?

1127
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:08,400
Ten in the morning, your brother's
gonna be standing in front of the diner.

1128
01:36:08,600 --> 01:36:12,560
- Give him a message for me?
- Yeah.

1129
01:36:15,040 --> 01:36:20,400
Tell him that just because
a person didn't show up,

1130
01:36:20,640 --> 01:36:25,000
doesn't mean that the person
doesn't care about him.

1131
01:37:22,840 --> 01:37:25,920
You read it?
OK, we'll go over it again.

1132
01:37:26,120 --> 01:37:29,920
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want..."

1133
01:37:31,400 --> 01:37:35,480
Here you go.
Come back for seconds.

1134
01:38:34,000 --> 01:38:36,840
Jane. You OK?

1135
01:38:37,040 --> 01:38:38,840
Hi.

1136
01:40:25,200 --> 01:40:26,680
Thanks.

1137
01:40:35,360 --> 01:40:38,320
Souvenir of someone I once knew.

1138
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:43,520
- Where are you headed?
- Pensacola, Florida.

1139
01:40:43,720 --> 01:40:46,160
Never been there.

1140
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:53,040
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- No, no, no.

1141
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:55,440
No, sir.

1142
01:40:55,640 --> 01:40:59,080
Maybe for the first time in my life I'm not.

1143
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,840
Well, damn! Would you look at that?

1144
01:41:46,360 --> 01:41:48,200
Yes, sir!

1145
01:41:49,600 --> 01:41:51,520
Yes, sir!

1146
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:46,120
Praise Jesus!

1147
01:43:59,560 --> 01:44:01,800
Come on, baby!

1148
01:44:02,000 --> 01:44:04,800
Come on, baby, rain!

1149
01:44:05,000 --> 01:44:06,720
Rain!

1150
01:44:06,920 --> 01:44:09,240
Thank you, Jesus!
