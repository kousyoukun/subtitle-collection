1
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:12,637
- Hand over that gun!
- You thought you held all the cards.

2
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,832
You thought you'd force me
not to file for divorce.

3
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,879
Erica, the gun is mine. I want it.

4
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:28,753
Not until I've had a good explanation.

5
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,155
Shit! Shit!

6
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:45,908
- What's going on?
- Drunk-driving in Atlanta, remember?

7
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,509
- Did he see you?
- I don't think so.

8
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,231
Get up.

9
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,078
- Whose is this?
- Mine.

10
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,909
- I don't know, 80 in a 55.
- You'll never get away with it.

11
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,793
O ye of little faith!

12
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,080
- Did you fix that transmitter?
- Ready.

13
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:12,589
What's going on?

14
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,677
Turn me on.

15
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,312
- I'm just a country boy!
- I'll cover that.

16
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,159
Frequency 6, check your local listings.

17
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,672
- A cold reading, $10 ante, who's in?
- I'm with my boss.

18
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,189
I say he can't do it.

19
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,994
Where's your loyalty?

20
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:39,197
- Oh, child, he looks nasty!
- This is gonna be real good.

21
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,674
Sh! Listen.

22
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:44,190
Is this beautiful country or what?
How fast was I going?

23
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,278
- 80 in a 55.
- Whoa! Really?

24
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,198
Licence and registration.

25
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,674
Yes, sir.

26
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:54,429
Let's see what we got here, Lowell.
Let's see.

27
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,394
A playing card. My only royal flush,
signed by Shorty Casewell.

28
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,352
Let's see. We got...

29
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,994
Licence and registration, sir.

30
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,312
Relax, where's the fire?

31
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:15,752
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Do you have the documents?

32
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:19,669
Course I do. I'm a law-abiding citizen,
just like yourself.

33
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:25,635
The difference is there's more to life
than my nine to five.

34
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,712
If you knew that, you'd still have
a wife and daughter to go home to.

35
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:35,390
Sir, put your hands on the bus,
feet apart.

36
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,795
Whoa! A little cranky, aren't we?

37
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,709
- What's he doing?
- He's gone too far, as usual.

38
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,750
You could've bought me dinner first!

39
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:49,396
We're gonna take a walk
over to the car, sir. This way.

40
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,670
- He's going to jail.
- He's not.

41
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:54,440
He stopped writing, didn't he?

42
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,473
Oh, man.

43
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,318
Enough about me, Lowell.
It's not really me you're mad at.

44
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,593
You're mad at yourself, 'cause you lost
the person who loved you.

45
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:15,190
- You have the right to remain silent.
- "Frequency of names..."

46
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,029
- Anything you say will...
- "By decade, by religion..."

47
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:24,678
I'm not talking about your ex-wife.
You know who I'm talking about...

48
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,995
...Cathy.

49
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:30,077
Cathy.

50
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,633
Son of a bitch.

51
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,673
The guy has balls
the size of cantaloupes!

52
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,396
You think I don't know how it is?
Risking your life for minimum wage.

53
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:43,433
Never enough for those pretty dresses,

54
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,916
that fancy summer camp
all her friends went to.

55
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,192
Then some rich asshole
takes not only your wife,

56
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,755
but your own little girl.

57
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,518
Have you seen her?

58
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,314
Can't say that I have,
but I know people.

59
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,355
And I know she misses the way
you protected her. Like a princess.

60
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,393
The way you smiled at her
the night of the prom.

61
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,194
Good times teaching her the violin.

62
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,391
The what?

63
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,397
Violin...

64
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,990
Clair de lune.

65
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,077
We played that together.

66
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,794
No rich step-daddy can give her that.

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,195
She hasn't called in over a year.

68
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:32,599
You made her choose between you
and her mother. You drove her away.

69
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,433
Maybe I'll call her tonight.

70
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,471
Tonight...

71
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:42,309
When I got a phone
right there on that bus?

72
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,997
You wouldn't mind?

73
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:54,192
My brother Lowell,
what are friends for?

74
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,630
Yeah!

75
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,311
Yeah!

76
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,070
I talked to her
and I'll go see her on the weekend.

77
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,590
- Thank you, Brother Lowell.
- I can't thank you enough.

78
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,199
Praise the Lord!

79
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:14,439
- Did she win?
- And he made a donation. Unbelievable!

80
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:18,713
I got the Wellesley decal
and the wedding band, but the violin?

81
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,276
Red mark on the jaw from the chin rest.
You know me, I know people!

82
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:28,678
Yeah, well, I'll make it back
just when you least expect it.

83
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:31,792
I always expect it.
That's why I always win.

84
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,596
If it wasn't for you, I'd be playing
doctor with some car thief.

85
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,475
- What can I say, man?
- Just say, "Thank you, Jesus!"

86
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,233
- You OK back there?
- Something's blown.

87
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,793
Man!

88
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,638
What's happened?

89
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,070
Truck's blowing smoke, man.

90
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,431
- Next exit, let's get off.
- You got it.

91
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,799
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
This is the place.

92
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,629
- You know where we are?
- This is nowhere.

93
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:53,476
Hey, what's up?

94
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,389
We don't get a replacement part
till Tuesday. Yeah, four days!

95
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,239
- Shit! We'd clean up in Topeka.
- Yeah.

96
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,113
I'm exhausted. We could use a break.

97
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,709
You're gonna get one. We got no choice.

98
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:10,357
I always have a choice.
Set up, we'll play here.

99
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,958
Here?

100
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,958
Here.

101
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:26,512
This is where the truckers come.

102
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:30,156
This looks nice.

103
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,510
I can smell trouble like shit on a griddle.

104
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,314
Take a look at what just walked in.

105
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:40,273
Dolores, you are such a bone-hound.

106
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,789
Everybody needs a hobby.

107
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,877
Even you.

108
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,832
- Sit down here, baby.
- Like I was saying, that man is nasty!

109
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,917
Maybelline, yeah.

110
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,988
- He ain't gonna bother you or me.
- I know.

111
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,833
Marva, huh? As in "Marvellous"?

112
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:13,191
- As in my grandmother.
- Not for a second.

113
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,039
- I'm Jonas.
- Hi.

114
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,070
Something got you down suddenly?

115
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:27,033
I never knew a problem
Chuck Berry couldn't solve.

116
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,390
It's broken.

117
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:33,636
Maybe I can fix it.
Life's too short to go without music.

118
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:37,389
Why don't you try laying on hands?

119
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,558
I wish I could, ma'am,
'cause I know how Jesus loves to rock.

120
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,151
Where's your manners?
He's a preacher. Be polite.

121
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:53,073
Hm, corn relish! I hate corn relish.

122
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,714
- First female serial killer?
- Aileen Wuornos.

123
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,150
- How many victims?
- Eight.

124
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,397
Special is steak.
No liver, no fish, no spinach.

125
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,751
- Awful lot of noes there, Marva.
- No lip.

126
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,952
I'll take the diet plate, please.

127
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,710
- She wants me.
- Yeah!

128
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:17,233
You should stick
with your bible-boinkers.

129
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,351
A woman is like a sling-shot.

130
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,439
The greater the resistance,
the further you can get with her.

131
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,312
Besides, she's warming up.

132
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,954
What brought him
to the service of Our Lord?

133
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,438
You know, Georgette, to me
there's no greater thrill than preaching.

134
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:36,269
First moment, you wonder,
"Can I touch them?

135
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,029
"Will they feel what I feel?"

136
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:46,349
Sometimes they don't feel it at first,
that sense of needing the Lord.

137
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:50,997
You know how it feels to really need
something, don't you, Georgette?

138
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,078
- Your order?
- Two chilies. Hold the onions.

139
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:57,477
Sometimes a person doesn't
know what they need.

140
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:02,993
They wake up itchy,
hungry for whiskey or money or food.

141
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,715
What they really need is love.

142
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:11,471
Sweet, tender caresses of the Lord.

143
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,875
- Amen! All right, Reverend.
- Amen.

144
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,640
- May I take your order?
- Sure.

145
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,308
I'll have the KKK omelette.

146
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:21,317
Whites only.

147
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,397
Get out of here!

148
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:26,672
I'm kidding. I'll have a decaf and toast.

149
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,915
And I give them that love, Georgette,
That... and salvation!

150
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,590
Salvation is the only thing
in this world that matters.

151
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,634
More comforting than a lover.
More valuable than diamonds.

152
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,957
Come on, Preacher! Come on!

153
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,196
See this?

154
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,318
It was a gift from my sainted mother
the year I graduated seminary.

155
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,317
- God bless her.
- Very nice.

156
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,556
I'll get it.

157
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,792
See, Marva?

158
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,037
Nothing has value without salvation.

159
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:20,036
- He put it in the water!
- Just like it was baptised!

160
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,919
He loves the Lord!

161
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,356
What's the date?

162
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,632
Someone could notice that
in a small town.

163
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,958
It pisses off the law. They think
I've a year's salary on my wrist.

164
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,469
The sheriff is Braverman.
He's clean.

165
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,591
Clean? Ugh!

166
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:07,796
Mr Nightengale,
arbitrary is not an issue here.

167
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,195
We've got a 27% unemployment rate.

168
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:14,518
- I need 20 guys for four days.
- Great! 26%!

169
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,709
Look, no new permits
till the plants reopen

170
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,195
or till our farmers get some rain.

171
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:25,597
Till then, this town can't afford a revival.

172
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,439
- Sorry.
- Oh, no. I understand, Sheriff.

173
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:34,351
- You're just trying to do your job.
- No. He's trying to restrict trade.

174
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:36,834
Listen, Braverman.

175
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:41,113
I got a room full of New York lawyers
dying to take on some badge

176
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:43,436
interfering with religious freedom!

177
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,634
I got the fee, I'll do the paperwork.
You give me the permit or I dial 2-1-2.

178
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,268
- Knock yourself out.
- I'll do it.

179
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:12,917
Don't take it personally, boss.
It's just one for the big guy upstairs.

180
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,318
So, is all of this
absolutely necessary, Will?

181
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,990
Local law.
"The Attack of the Puny Brains".

182
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,919
I kissed up to him, I got the permit.

183
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,159
Besides, this one's cute for a change.
Now, concentrate.

184
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:37,909
Population: 22-something.
Median family income: $21,000...

185
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:40,953
Cute? He can shut us down.

186
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,199
I don't have to remind you
what our nut is: 3,500 a day.

187
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,473
Every town, another puny brain.

188
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,478
Give a little man power,
he thinks he's powerful.

189
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:57,674
Yeah, I've seen that happen before.
OK, main industries: Wheat and corn.

190
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:03,716
Ancillaries have had massive lay-offs.
The banks report 22% farm foreclosure.

191
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:07,913
If they don't get rain by this weekend,
this year's crops will fail.

192
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,954
So we can use that.
Stop drumming, Jonas! Stop!

193
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,513
What a shit-hole!

194
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,473
This was your choice, so live with it.

195
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:20,468
Average education: 10th grade.
Richest family: The Rayloves.

196
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:23,672
Twelve towns in the same area,
same situation...

197
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:27,475
I gotta get you a man.
You've been on the road too long.

198
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,070
We're gonna hire us a new angel.
You pick him!

199
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,875
- Finished?
- I'm starting to get excited.

200
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:39,358
A town this deep in the crapper's
got nowhere to turn but God!

201
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,512
Kansas Radio.

202
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:50,510
When the going gets tough,
the tough dial S-O-S.

203
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,756
Speaking of things getting tough,

204
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:57,272
I've got someone here who says
he can help. Jonas Nightengale.

205
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:01,758
A man who knows
about the value of spirit.

206
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,679
Thank you, Jerry Joe. Thank you.

207
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:09,076
You know, as I look out your window,

208
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,714
Rustwater reminds me
of my own home town.

209
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,275
Drugstore soda fountain.

210
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:18,553
Little movie theatre.
The one with the real butter.

211
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,592
And it warms my heart.

212
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:27,032
So many people working so hard,
deserving so much better.

213
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:32,473
I know how it feels to see
old man Raylove driving his fancy car,

214
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:36,116
all the while thinking,
"I want me a car like that."

215
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,756
The problem is
you've got nothing to believe in.

216
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,838
Can't believe in the community
with its trouble,

217
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,794
it seems sometimes even the family.
So what do you believe in?

218
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:50,788
The biggest power,
the biggest man with the plan...

219
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,637
Thirty seconds.

220
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,757
So I'm here to remind you
that tonight

221
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,157
at the Rustwater camp-ground
you too, can be saved.

222
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:09,150
If you're already walking with Jesus,
celebrate your faith with your neighbour.

223
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,920
It's been too long since you've seen him.

224
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:17,558
If you're still driving that beat-up pick-up,
eating macaroni and day-old bread,

225
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:23,471
come and celebrate the miracle of faith,
the power of healing.

226
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,274
And you too, can wake up saying,

227
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,390
"Thank you, Jesus!"

228
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,068
I been lonely, I been cheated

229
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,078
I been misunderstood

230
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:42,717
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good

231
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,718
But with you I belong

232
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:48,195
'Cause you help me be strong

233
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,834
There's a change in my life

234
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,430
Since you came along
Oh, yeah

235
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:04,431
Now, I don't mind working
So hard everyday...

236
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,476
Your wife was great to meet.
I'm Jonas Nightengale.

237
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:14,834
Come down for an old-fashioned
revival with lots of music and singing.

238
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,429
And bring your wife along tonight.

239
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:21,590
Bye-bye.

240
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,513
Thank you.

241
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,319
I been lonely, I been cheated

242
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,397
I been misunderstood

243
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,071
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good

244
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:47,070
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong

245
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,714
There's a change in my life...

246
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,275
Hey, what's your name?

247
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:56,837
You go to high school here?
No? Going to college?

248
00:19:57,040 --> 00:20:02,273
Now, a man, a man gets crazy
When he finds he's done wrong

249
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,837
And a heart, a heart gets weary
When it doesn't belong

250
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,831
And the road, the road gets rocky, Lord
You've got to keep on

251
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:19,229
Let the new light come
Shining on through

252
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,836
I been lonely, I been cheated...

253
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,039
Tonight, tomorrow night and the next...

254
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,755
Hey, Jonas Nightengale.
How are you?

255
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,269
Keep your eye on the squirt gun.

256
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,631
One, two, three!

257
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,036
Gone.

258
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:42,835
Come to the tent meeting.
Miracles and wonders.

259
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,718
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong

260
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:59,074
There's a change in my life
Since you came along

261
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:03,592
I been lonely, I been cheated
I been misunderstood

262
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:08,476
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good

263
00:21:08,680 --> 00:21:12,753
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong

264
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,474
There's a change in my life

265
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:17,989
Since you came along...

266
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,072
I sink this one,
you guys come to the meeting?

267
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,319
- Yeah, all right.
- OK.

268
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:28,557
Afternoon, sir.

269
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,554
Sheriff sent me to check for violations.

270
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,672
I bet he did.
Go ahead, we're clean. Go on.

271
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:38,916
Knock yourself out.

272
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,191
Great. It's a frigging hootenanny!

273
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,151
You've been very busy, Will.

274
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,952
Just doing my job.

275
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:04,435
Yeah, I can see that.

276
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:07,791
It's been a long day.
Can I buy you a beer?

277
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,955
Tell me, do most of the cops
fall for your act?

278
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:18,354
Yeah.

279
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,074
I'll bet they do.

280
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:24,511
Well, ma'am, sorry about the drink,
but I'm on duty.

281
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:30,113
No, no. My mom is "ma'am".
You can call me Jane.

282
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,278
All right.

283
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,198
Goodbye, Jane.

284
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,277
Goodbye, Will.

285
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,515
Just kidding.

286
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,598
You have any towels?

287
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,473
Wow, nice room!

288
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:06,513
What's the matter? You seem down.

289
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:11,308
I'm just bummed about Topeka.
I wanted to see that breeder.

290
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:16,949
- You can't keep a Great Dane on a bus.
- Why not?

291
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,879
Lt'd be great company.

292
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,269
Why don't you give this to me?
It looks better on me.

293
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,313
You'll get it when I die unless you kill me.

294
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:30,353
And it's in my will that way.

295
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:39,639
- My offer still holds for a new angel.
- I can just see it.

296
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:44,914
"Wanted: Single tenor with interest
in gourmet cooking and mail fraud."

297
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,197
- What's new with Miss Congeniality?
- Nothing.

298
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,837
And I'm using all my "A" material.
How could she not go for it?

299
00:24:54,040 --> 00:24:56,759
So you strike out for once.
What do you care?

300
00:24:56,960 --> 00:25:00,555
It's got me curious.
She's got fuming down to an art.

301
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:03,513
It's a matter of principle, like a quest.

302
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:06,712
Sort of a Holy Grail of road pussy?

303
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:10,037
Eloquent as always.

304
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:13,429
Tambourines, T-shirts, bumper stickers!

305
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,676
Bibles! Tambourines!

306
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:22,680
Tambourines, T-shirts, bumper stickers!

307
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,598
Get your bibles here!

308
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:29,271
How are you doing this evening?
Come right in. Come right in.

309
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:32,677
Tambourines! Praise the Lord!

310
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,237
Bibles! T-shirts! Bumper stickers!

311
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,876
- Come on up!
- Come right in!

312
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:42,832
Bumper stickers!

313
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:47,430
Have you ever seen anything
like that in your life?

314
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:54,673
- Bless you.
- Bless you. Come right on in.

315
00:25:57,080 --> 00:26:00,197
Come right on in.
Hi, how are you?

316
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,673
- Hey, how's it going?
- OK.

317
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,598
Let's see what we've got.

318
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,677
Where are you?

319
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,916
Oh, there you are. Nice suit!

320
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:32,994
Guys!

321
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,593
Excuse me. Are you from Rustwater?

322
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:44,590
- No, I drove thirty miles to be here.
- Thirty miles. That far?

323
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:47,268
- What is your name?
- Emma Schlarp.

324
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:51,189
I have a great seat
right in front of the preacher for you.

325
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:54,836
- Would you like to have it?
- Oh, yes.

326
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:58,510
Sit right here,
and I'll roll you down there.

327
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,597
That's very nice of you.

328
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:04,588
It's a much better view
and this chair's a lot softer.

329
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,552
Thank you.

330
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,433
It's nothing but trouble with that old man.

331
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,838
He's got 80 yards of electrified fence
spitting distance to the house.

332
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:18,318
You know our kids play over there,
and somebody's gonna get hurt.

333
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:24,796
...loving Jesus gives you
a warm feeling in your stomach...

334
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:28,197
Guy in cowboy hat
says he loves Jesus.

335
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:31,551
Really? I thought
they were just good friends.

336
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:34,228
Make sure to hit him up personally.

337
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,112
Absolutely.

338
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:38,390
- You like it?
- Yeah.

339
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:40,352
Cut it out, Matt!

340
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:44,109
- You here alone?
- I'm with my mom.

341
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,835
If she catches me talking with you...
I gotta go, OK?

342
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,600
Can I see you after the show?

343
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,631
- OK. Nice to see you.
- You too.

344
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,472
Girl in glitter jeans is pregnant.

345
00:27:58,680 --> 00:28:01,911
Her mother's been beating her.
That's nice.

346
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,475
Where is she sitting?

347
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,076
Town's small, Jonas.
Don't mention she's knocked up.

348
00:28:09,280 --> 00:28:10,713
I'll be good.

349
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:13,150
Did you study my summary?

350
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:18,229
Yeah. And the Grange ladies told me
who's been sleeping around.

351
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:22,119
Tiny, you got the smoke ready?

352
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,995
What's Roger doing?
Tell him five shills is enough.

353
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,953
Come on, the angels will see him.

354
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:32,311
What's the deal
with the cherry hat again?

355
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:36,718
Electric fence.
Visualise the fence with cherries on it.

356
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:40,959
- What do you like? This or this?
- Ready to check your receiver?

357
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:44,152
I'm having an accessory crisis.

358
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:47,272
Testing sibilance, one, two.
Can you hear me?

359
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,631
That's fine.
Boy, are you a tough room!

360
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:53,593
The dark grey, definitely.

361
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:55,995
You look gorgeous.

362
00:28:56,200 --> 00:28:58,760
Always look better than they do, Janey.

363
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:02,555
And now, let's go give
some empty lives a little meaning!

364
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:06,753
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- Ready as I can be!

365
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,475
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- The spirit will set you free

366
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,557
Are you ready? Are you ready?

367
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:23,838
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- Ready as I can be

368
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:27,715
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- The spirit will set you free

369
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:37,593
Are you ready for a miracle?

370
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:45,031
Be strong in the Lord
and in the power of his might!

371
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,398
Be strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

372
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:54,513
Put on the whole armour of God
that ye may be able to stand

373
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,676
against the wiles of the Devil!

374
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,431
Come on, Hoov. Goose 'em.
I got a cold audience out there.

375
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,236
Yes, I'm ready! Yeah!

376
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:08,956
I hear Satan knocking,
but he can't come in! Yes, sir!

377
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,559
Come on, people!

378
00:30:10,760 --> 00:30:14,275
Turn it loose,
let him fix it and let him in!

379
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:18,632
Take it down, angels.
I gotta talk to these people.

380
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:22,913
I gotta talk to these people a second.
I wanna tell you a story...

381
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,157
- This'll move you.
...about a man from New York.

382
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,477
A man named Thomas.

383
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:32,956
Now, Thomas lived on Fifth Avenue.

384
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:36,596
Views of Central Park
even from the bathroom!

385
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:40,270
Beautiful wife. Two sweet kids.

386
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,916
But his life was a mess.
You know why?

387
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:47,355
Because of the fear.

388
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:50,393
Afraid his business would fail.

389
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:53,319
Afraid his children would come to harm.

390
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:56,159
Afraid of balding
and his wife leaving him.

391
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,670
Afraid of death.
But death's a breeze.

392
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:03,111
Ever heard of anyone
coming back to complain? No!

393
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:07,871
- It's life that'll kill you...
- Matt, give your people a wake-up call.

394
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,548
...and Thomas was a prisoner of fear.

395
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:15,038
- Amen, Preacher!
- Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!

396
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:18,437
...he got a $2,000 hairpiece
and a world-class doctor.

397
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,596
- But was Tom happy?
- No!

398
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,233
No! N-O.

399
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:28,151
Because when Thomas finally
came to me, he still had the fear.

400
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:34,469
The fear is bigger than doctors!
The fear is bigger than money!

401
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:36,159
- Absolutely!
- Amen!

402
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,876
There's only thing bigger
than the fear, my friends.

403
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:45,437
And that one thing... is the faith.

404
00:31:45,640 --> 00:31:48,029
- Hallelujah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

405
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,549
Faith that the universe needs him!

406
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:53,752
Faith that his woman
loves his soul not his hair!

407
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:58,909
Faith that his children will be protected
not by a man with a.357 Magnum,

408
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,319
but by The Man with the super-charged
grenade launcher of love!

409
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,519
And that one man is one man
and one man only.

410
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,438
That man is Jesus Christ!

411
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,353
Yeah!

412
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,074
If you wanna feel happy,

413
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:21,556
if you wanna feel love,
all you gotta do...

414
00:32:21,760 --> 00:32:24,957
If you wanna feel safe,
if you wanna feel strong,

415
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:28,357
if you wanna walk tall,
all you gotta do,

416
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:33,315
all you gotta do,
all you gotta do is get saved!

417
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,392
Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you, Jesus!

418
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:40,512
- Say "Hallelujah".
- Hallelujah!

419
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,872
- Looking good, Jo Jo.
- Holy juice pumps through my veins!

420
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:48,992
I feel a healing coming on.

421
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,070
But I need to know
you're on the side of the Lord.

422
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,794
I need a sign of your faith.

423
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:03,470
I'm not asking you to pay
for this beautiful music, no!

424
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,877
I'm not asking you to pay
for the word of God.

425
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:10,470
What I do need is
some token that you believe.

426
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:15,515
- How about that ruby ring?
- You belong to the most exclusive club!

427
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,429
A club that only God's
faithful and generous can join.

428
00:33:19,640 --> 00:33:22,234
- Only then...
- Give me that ring!

429
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,477
No one can keep you
out of the kingdom of heaven!

430
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,719
- Tell her I'm gonna kill her!
- You're meat, baby.

431
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,275
OK, I'll be good!

432
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,358
They are going to pass among you.

433
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:39,633
- The more you give, the more you live!
- Praise the Lord, brother!

434
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:45,233
The Lord spoke to me tonight.
He's searching for some special people.

435
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,637
They'll receive great rewards
in material goods.

436
00:33:48,840 --> 00:33:53,231
He wants these special people
to be saved here on stage with me!

437
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:57,670
It's sad out there, that's all I have to say.

438
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,632
It's burgers tonight.

439
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:10,238
Oh, people,
the Lord is speaking to me right now.

440
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:15,230
- It better be good.
- Relax. Cherry hat. Section 4, row F.

441
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,830
You, sir, in the brown jacket.
I feel your burden.

442
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:20,598
Who? Who, me?

443
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:24,236
Yes, sir. Tell me
if I'm hearing the Lord right.

444
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:28,194
- You've a problem with your neighbour?
- I sure have!

445
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,631
- That fence is going to harm your kids?
- Yes, sir!

446
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,478
Amazing!

447
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:37,559
...make him your friend,
serve him your best fried chicken!

448
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,070
- 'Cause yours is the best in the county.
- It is!

449
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:44,909
I'd love some of that.
Now thank the Lord for his saving!

450
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:52,550
Section 5, row A is the glitter jeans.
Remember glitter jeans?

451
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:54,512
Sister!

452
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:58,679
You're suffering deeply.
You're worried about your little girl.

453
00:34:58,880 --> 00:35:00,791
- Yes, Reverend.
- Stand up.

454
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:05,039
The Lord says a strike unto any
of his children is a strike unto him.

455
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:08,152
Lord, I hear you. Please forgive me.

456
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,911
- Jesus forgives you. Say "Hallelujah!"
- Hallelujah!

457
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,473
Fishing cap, section 4, row F.

458
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:27,150
You, sir. Come up on stage
and be cured of your gambling!

459
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:32,036
That's incredible!
Section 1, pink mu-mu. She lost her job.

460
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:33,878
You, in the pink dress.

461
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:37,709
Receive the Lord
and you will find another job!

462
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,309
First row. White shirt. Back problem.

463
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:44,997
You, sir. Believe in the Lord
and cure your backache!

464
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,589
Same section, yellow shirt.
Hearing problem.

465
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,678
You, sir, come up on stage!

466
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,438
Hearing problem!

467
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,989
Section 2, the blue-haired lady.
She's got arthritis.

468
00:35:57,200 --> 00:36:00,192
You too, ma'am. Come up on stage!

469
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,359
- We're gonna help some people.
- Ah, we are!

470
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:13,756
- He's got trouble with his neighbours.
- Let him fix it! Let him in!

471
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:16,918
Hallelujah!

472
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:21,434
I'm feeling something tonight!

473
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:26,191
- He's got a sore neck.
- Receive the anointing in Jesus' name!

474
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,870
- Say, "Thank you, Jesus!"
- She needs a job.

475
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,197
You need a job?
Now you're working for Jesus!

476
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:36,870
- A gambling man.
- Get the strength in your life!

477
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:39,036
Holy name of Jesus!

478
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,710
- He can't hear a thing.
- Hear the word, hear the word!

479
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:45,878
In Jesus' holy name!

480
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:51,397
- Welcome to the kingdom of heaven.
- Arthritis.

481
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:54,990
Arthritis? Take the hand
of God's right-hand man.

482
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:58,351
Believe in the power of the Lord. Believe.

483
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,791
Raise your hands. Raise them up!

484
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,195
Wave your hands like this!

485
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,958
Thank you, Jesus!

486
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,311
Someone here's just been
cured of their asthma.

487
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,158
Hello, friend!

488
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,590
She's got bad bones, Reverend.

489
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,392
Hold it, hold it!

490
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:18,592
Take it down just a second.
Take it down.

491
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,075
We got someone special here.

492
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,316
- What's your name?
- Emma Schlarp.

493
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,353
- How long you had bone trouble?
- Years.

494
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:31,475
Well, God's gonna make
a miracle for you tonight.

495
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:34,638
O Lord, I'm just a man like any other,

496
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:39,277
but send a miracle through my hands
to help my sister Emma.

497
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:48,439
Come on, Emma.
Show me the power of the Lord.

498
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,395
Praise God. Praise God.

499
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,750
Praise God!

500
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,559
Thank you, Jesus. Come on, walk to me.

501
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,751
Go on, Emma!

502
00:38:06,920 --> 00:38:08,592
Yes! Yes!

503
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:12,989
It's a miracle! Hallelujah!

504
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,668
It's a miracle! Dance with me!

505
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:20,158
Oh, say, "Thank you, Jesus."
Thank you, Jesus!

506
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:23,756
And I'm walking...

507
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:26,793
Highway up to heaven

508
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:30,231
No one can walk up there
But the pure in heart

509
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:33,159
It's a highway up to heaven

510
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:39,037
And I'm walking...
I'm so glad it's a highway up to heaven

511
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:43,199
You just can't walk up there
You gotta be pure in heart

512
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,155
Thank you. Thank Jesus!

513
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,828
In the name of Jesus!

514
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,714
- How did we do?
- About four grand.

515
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:34,354
Hey, Tony, I'm dressing!

516
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:38,077
Sorry, pal.

517
00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:49,398
What's he doing here?

518
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:55,671
Well, well.
If it isn't my new best friend.

519
00:39:55,880 --> 00:39:59,350
We've had the fire department,
the sanitation department.

520
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,869
What now? The Girl Scouts?

521
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:05,993
Nightengale, we both know
there's nothing I can do legally.

522
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,997
I'm here man to man.

523
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:12,955
Folks have lost their jobs, their land.
They can't feed their families.

524
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,152
So they sure can't afford
a con-man like you.

525
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,636
Do a good thing. Pack it up.

526
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,960
That's some plain talk, Will.
So I'll give you a little in return.

527
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,754
- Good night, folks.
- Night, sir.

528
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:35,832
Let's assume I was
what you said I was.

529
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:39,749
In New York, they've got
Broadway shows costing $65 a pop

530
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,554
just to walk in the door.

531
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:48,995
Maybe you like the show.
Maybe you don't, and you kick yourself.

532
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:51,475
I give my people a good show,

533
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,717
plenty of music,
worthwhile sentiments.

534
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,435
Most of them go home
with a little hope in their lives.

535
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:03,475
Now, usually, I only play towns
that can afford me.

536
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:07,036
But what about towns like this
that really need me?

537
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:11,279
You don't care what these people need.
You're looking to cash in.

538
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:14,313
Oh, pissing contest! Can I watch?

539
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,999
- I won't just go away.
- Now, that sounds good!

540
00:41:22,200 --> 00:41:27,593
'Cause you owe me that drink, Will.
Jonas, in the bus.

541
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:33,111
Will, what's that guy from
the sanitation department's name?

542
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:37,393
- Phil.
- Phil? I called him Frank. Anyway...

543
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,952
Come on, Janey! Wake up, baby!

544
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,913
God! It's eight o'clock!

545
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:02,396
I know what time it is.
I've been driving all night.

546
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,558
Wait till you see this. Close your eyes.

547
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,718
- They were closed.
- Come on, close them.

548
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:10,558
Pucker up.

549
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:13,228
Kiss. Big kiss.

550
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,435
Wow!

551
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:19,949
Hi! Where did you get him?

552
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:23,994
I found a breeder in Clydedale.
I convinced him to open late.

553
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:26,839
Ah, so let's hear it for insomnia.

554
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:30,794
I was worried about
your lack of companionship.

555
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:34,037
- What's his name?
- He's smart and hung like a moose.

556
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,152
- So I thought...
- Jack from Neptune!

557
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:40,477
- Come on!
- I know, Jonas Junior.

558
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:44,639
- Jonas! He's a good boy, too!
- He's great.

559
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,189
So here we'll make "such" as "drought",
"really" is "rain".

560
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:54,234
- And we'll make "won't" "tornadoes".
- OK, try me.

561
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:59,798
"Brother Jonas, I am wondering,
what question burns inside this woman."

562
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,515
If there'll be a twister
at her son's home in Wilmington.

563
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,678
- No, "wondering" is "Wichita".
- Wichita!

564
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:10,555
- I don't wanna do this audience tonight.
- Why? You're good.

565
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:15,356
- That's not the point.
- Relax. Pathos isn't contagious.

566
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:21,478
Besides, the badge saw the set-up
last night. We can't take the chance.

567
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:26,231
- What did you two do after dinner?
- Nothing. I'm just greasing the wheels.

568
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:30,831
- Till one in the morning? A lot of grease.
- Your spies are slipping.

569
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:32,951
I was out till two.

570
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:37,472
You know how to play this, Jane.
Just watch your step!

571
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:44,870
Mr Nightengale, I'm so glad I caught you.

572
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:47,355
I was at your meeting last night,

573
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:51,394
and I heard what you said
to that family who lost their farm.

574
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:57,675
My husband lost his job, and
it's been hard putting food on the table.

575
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:01,839
Sorry to hear that. Come down tonight
and maybe I can help.

576
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,112
Oh, heavens, it's not me.

577
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:10,440
The best way to forget your troubles
is to help someone else with theirs.

578
00:44:10,640 --> 00:44:13,916
This is for that unfortunate family.

579
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,998
Will you see that they get it?

580
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,431
I certainly will.
That's mighty Christian of you.

581
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:22,517
Bless you.

582
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:29,114
You try it and you're toast!

583
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:38,230
You're gonna get it now!

584
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:51,995
Hey, Rev!
Looking for some souls to save?

585
00:44:52,200 --> 00:44:57,115
You know me, I hate to see
even one get away. Souls, that is.

586
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,798
I brought you this. It's the best in town.

587
00:45:02,000 --> 00:45:05,037
- Hey, kid. How about a game?
- Da.

588
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:08,357
- I thought you had homework.
- I'll do it later.

589
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,232
Little Russkie, huh?

590
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,914
I ever tell you I was
East Coast chess champion 1971?

591
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:20,357
My sister's a total slave-driver.

592
00:45:20,560 --> 00:45:25,554
- Go ahead and make your move.
- What do you think I just did?

593
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,274
That was a neat trick you did yesterday.

594
00:45:28,480 --> 00:45:31,756
- The hand's quicker than the eye.
- So they tell me.

595
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,879
Nice move, kid.

596
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:46,072
Hey, Marva, could I have a thé glacé?

597
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,840
It's French for iced tea.

598
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:53,238
- Where's your church?
- On every street corner in every town.

599
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:58,355
- You don't have a church.
- I have a ministry, which is better.

600
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:01,074
My grandmother
used to take me with her.

601
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,632
So you believe in miracles, right?

602
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:09,037
Concentrate on your game, Boyd.

603
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:12,869
I'd like to hear what your sister
has to say on the subject.

604
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:17,835
I believe in life, what it does to you
and what you do back.

605
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:23,594
Never underestimate the power of belief.

606
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:28,430
With it, I've seen a mute sing
"Hallelujah" and a cripple dance.

607
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:33,913
When you've got it, you've got the power
of every ocean in your hand.

608
00:46:34,120 --> 00:46:37,032
Without it, you've got nothing.

609
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,519
Everyone is just another sinner,
and everywhere is just another hell.

610
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:52,594
I'll be outside.

611
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:59,876
- My sister thinks you're a fake.
- Maybe I am and maybe I'm not.

612
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:04,596
If I get the job done,
what difference does it make?

613
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:08,998
You're gonna need a miracle now,
because check and mate-ski!

614
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,631
This town is full of single women.
Leave me alone.

615
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,638
It must be your money.

616
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,552
I've seen many people lie to themselves,
but they don't fool anyone.

617
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,832
Lying, huh?
Your personal area of expertise?

618
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:42,999
That's not true.
My talent is telling people the truth.

619
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:49,395
Like that picture on the wall in there.
Best day of your life.

620
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,917
- One of.
- Sure it was.

621
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:55,953
You were young, you were free.

622
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,032
You still had that spark in your eye.

623
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,917
Now you hide out in that diner,
never letting anyone get next to you.

624
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:09,192
The last time you had a man
Nixon was in office.

625
00:48:09,400 --> 00:48:14,030
How I live my life is none
of your business. What do you want?

626
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:17,471
I want to know how come you gave up.

627
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:26,358
A drunk truck driver did that.

628
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:31,429
Four hours stuck in a crash
watching our mom and dad die.

629
00:48:31,640 --> 00:48:36,589
Doctors did all they could.
Took tests, stuck him with needles.

630
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:39,473
All for nothing.

631
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:42,274
So he had me take him to a preacher.

632
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:45,392
And the preacher got him up on stage.

633
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:49,275
When it was all over,
he was still on his crutches.

634
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:51,948
Know what he said to my little brother?

635
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:55,118
He said that it was his fault,

636
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:58,357
'cause his faith wasn't strong enough.

637
00:48:58,560 --> 00:49:00,630
Let me tell you something.

638
00:49:00,840 --> 00:49:03,798
All that boy has is faith.

639
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:08,198
The last thing he needs is
another phoney messing him up.

640
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:13,713
And the last thing I need is another man
using him to get me into bed.

641
00:49:15,360 --> 00:49:18,909
Hey, Rev, how about a rematch?

642
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:22,192
Sorry, kid, I gotta go.

643
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:24,595
Can't stand the heat, huh?

644
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,995
Got it in one, kid.

645
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:41,233
If I pick it too soon, it won't sweeten.

646
00:49:41,440 --> 00:49:45,228
If I leave it on the stock too long,
it rots on the way to market.

647
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:50,468
Too much rain turns it mouldy,
too little and it's hog-feed.

648
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,352
Timing's everything.

649
00:49:52,560 --> 00:49:54,437
Same as in my business.

650
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,473
You gotta pick 'em while they're ripe.

651
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,593
Will, I know you think I'm crooked,
so why'd you ask me here?

652
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,951
Well, you know those programmes

653
00:50:05,160 --> 00:50:09,551
where they take delinquents
out to the woods and rehabilitate them?

654
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,513
- This isn't the woods.
- Smart girl.

655
00:50:12,720 --> 00:50:15,234
I knew you were worth saving.

656
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:22,994
You've too much going for you
to be somebody's front man.

657
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:53,074
OK, guys, let's go!

658
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,275
Pick it up!

659
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,513
- Hey, Rev.
- Hey, kid.

660
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,358
Watch.

661
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,836
My dad used to lift weights.
He was state champion.

662
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:11,989
- Great, comrade. You gonna compete?
- Yeah, all events done sitting down!

663
00:51:12,200 --> 00:51:15,351
It's something I gotta do.
You have anything like that?

664
00:51:15,560 --> 00:51:19,314
Something I gotta do?
No, I stick with what I wanna do.

665
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:22,910
It's a tough policy, but it works for me.

666
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:25,793
Do you always jog in a cowboy hat?

667
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,992
I used to jog in my boots.

668
00:51:32,680 --> 00:51:35,513
What did the doctors tell you?

669
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,918
Doctors have nothing to do with my leg.
I'll walk if it's God's will.

670
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,908
Listen, God doesn't have
a trucker's licence.

671
00:51:44,120 --> 00:51:46,395
You think you were chosen to suffer?

672
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:51,196
If you've done everything you can,
doctors, therapy, that's great.

673
00:51:51,400 --> 00:51:56,793
But if you haven't, get off your ass,
'cause God won't do it for you.

674
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,869
Look, kid,
everybody's a loser one of these days.

675
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:05,197
The trick is not acting like a loser.

676
00:52:05,400 --> 00:52:08,949
I believe things happen for a reason.

677
00:52:09,160 --> 00:52:12,630
Fine. You wanna believe that?
That's great.

678
00:52:12,840 --> 00:52:14,910
I'm gonna run.

679
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:55,990
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I'm worried about that two-man code.

680
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:59,510
Maybe. But that's not why you're late.

681
00:52:59,720 --> 00:53:01,790
These are for me?

682
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,153
Can I read it?

683
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:13,592
Gidget goes dustbowl.
Fine, have your little secret.

684
00:53:15,720 --> 00:53:18,393
Will said he's got a surprise for you.

685
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,955
Something about
giving you enough rope.

686
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,720
Tell him to go kick some shit!

687
00:53:23,920 --> 00:53:26,753
There's not enough rope in Kansas
to hang me.

688
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:30,589
Besides, wait till you see the pitch.

689
00:53:30,800 --> 00:53:33,473
Got a little surprise myself.

690
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,430
Jesus is on the mainline
Tell him what you want

691
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:49,593
- Lord Jesus
- Tell him what you want

692
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:53,270
You gotta call him up
And tell him what you want

693
00:53:53,560 --> 00:53:55,915
Call him up, call him up...

694
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:57,917
You tell him!

695
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:18,869
Am I in white boy heaven
or what? Yes!

696
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:21,230
That was beautiful, children.

697
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:23,317
Children? Hm!

698
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:26,875
I want to tell you about myself.

699
00:54:27,080 --> 00:54:31,119
You look at me and you see a man
who seems a lot like you.

700
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:34,437
But all my life I've been different.

701
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:37,270
At first, it was a curse,

702
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:41,871
but soon I discovered
the blessing of my birth.

703
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:46,392
Now, what was it, you ask,
made me different?

704
00:54:46,600 --> 00:54:49,512
In an isolated cabin
in the Appalachian mountains,

705
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:53,952
Jonas Nightengale was born
with a caul about his face.

706
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:57,391
He told me his father invented Teflon.

707
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,194
Some say the caul's an old wives' tale,

708
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,392
but I've seen some
smart old wives in my day!

709
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:07,354
They say a baby born with a caul
is given the second sight.

710
00:55:07,560 --> 00:55:11,189
The sight inside a man's soul.

711
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:12,753
Hallelujah!

712
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:15,758
Sister Jane will pass among you...

713
00:55:15,960 --> 00:55:19,077
...and I want you
to ask her your questions.

714
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:22,238
I'm going to reach deep inside

715
00:55:22,440 --> 00:55:26,194
to find an answer
placed there by God.

716
00:55:26,400 --> 00:55:31,633
- What can Jonas do for you tonight?
- How much longer do I have?

717
00:55:31,840 --> 00:55:33,558
Brother Nightengale,

718
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:37,639
can you tell me the answer
to our brother's question?

719
00:55:38,880 --> 00:55:41,348
I'm hearing the voice of angels.

720
00:55:41,560 --> 00:55:45,030
- He's worried how long he has to go.
- Praise be!

721
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:50,394
Whether you've ten years or ten minutes,
what matters is that you really live!

722
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:55,230
So when God's chariot arrives,
you're ready to step on board!

723
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:59,035
- Yes, sir!
- I've been widowed about a year.

724
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,439
When they repossessed the farm,
my husband killed himself in the barn.

725
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:10,431
Has the Lord forgiven him
and welcomed him to heaven?

726
00:56:10,640 --> 00:56:14,553
Our sister would sincerely
like to know about a loved one.

727
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:18,839
I'll give you your answer, sister.

728
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:22,476
He rests with the angels.
He says God has forgiven him.

729
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,910
He asks you to do the same.

730
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:29,312
When's it gonna rain?

731
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:34,273
This man's question is really important.

732
00:56:35,840 --> 00:56:37,159
Oh, boy.

733
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:43,833
You want to know what every man
and woman in this tent wants to know.

734
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:47,635
- You want to know when's it gonna rain!
- Yes! Yes!

735
00:56:47,840 --> 00:56:50,991
Let me ask you this question:
What is rain anyway?

736
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:55,159
Is it the sweet nectar your crops crave?
Is it tears of joy?

737
00:56:55,360 --> 00:56:58,830
Or is it the rain that falls on every life?

738
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:04,672
The dressing down from your boss?
The bank pounding on the door?

739
00:57:04,880 --> 00:57:08,759
When you say to me,
"Jonas, when's it gonna rain?"

740
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,474
All I can say is...

741
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:15,712
"When's it gonna stop?"

742
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,276
In the Book of Psalms,
Chapter 27 reads as thus:

743
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:25,873
"The Lord is my light and my salvation:
Of whom shall I fear?"

744
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:32,030
The Lord is my light and my salvation

745
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,196
The Lord is the strength!

746
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:37,836
The Lord is my strength!
The Lord is your strength!

747
00:57:38,040 --> 00:57:40,679
The Lord is the strength of my life!

748
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,112
Strength of my life
Of whom shall I be...

749
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:50,110
Afraid...

750
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:10,512
I feel a healing coming on.

751
00:58:12,120 --> 00:58:14,680
- How many love Jesus?
- Yeah!

752
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,917
Are you ready for a miracle?

753
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,398
There it is, the word of God!
Yakety-yak, God's talking back!

754
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:33,476
- Hey, brother!
- Amen!

755
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:35,193
Whoa, people!

756
00:58:35,400 --> 00:58:38,073
Oh! Hallelujah, sister!

757
00:58:38,280 --> 00:58:40,794
Praise Jesus!
You're a slave in the spirit!

758
00:58:41,000 --> 00:58:44,788
Receive the holy anointing of Jesus!
Let Jesus fix it!

759
00:58:45,000 --> 00:58:47,514
- Somebody run!
- Me?

760
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:51,508
You, feel the power of the Lord!
Celebrate the Lord!

761
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:53,995
Celebrate the Lord!

762
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:56,236
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

763
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,954
Praise Jesus! Praise Jesus!

764
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:04,233
You're not gonna need this any longer.
I cast out your chains!

765
00:59:07,960 --> 00:59:11,157
The sign of the cross! Look!

766
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,999
He's in the room! He's alive!

767
00:59:14,200 --> 00:59:16,077
He's in me, he's in you!

768
00:59:16,280 --> 00:59:19,989
I see him in your eyes!
I feel him beating in your hearts!

769
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:24,478
Reach up and touch Jesus!
Nice to see you again, sister.

770
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:27,877
Praise Jesus, praise his name!
Praise the Lord!

771
00:59:28,080 --> 00:59:32,392
Receive his holy name!
Say "Hallelujah!"

772
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:37,433
I've never seen a room so full of God!
Say, "Thank you, Jesus!"

773
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:42,391
- Somebody say "Amen."
- Amen!

774
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,831
Hey!

775
00:59:49,040 --> 00:59:50,553
Hey!

776
00:59:53,360 --> 00:59:56,875
Wait a minute, Reverend.
I want to testify.

777
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:07,398
I said I want to testify.

778
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,670
So speak up, Sheriff.

779
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,476
Before you leave your
hard-earned money in those buckets,

780
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,319
I want you to know where it's going.

781
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,990
Alias Jonas Nightengale,
born Jack Newton,

782
01:00:23,200 --> 01:00:25,475
does not come from the Appalachians.

783
01:00:25,680 --> 01:00:27,989
He was born in the Bronx.

784
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:32,159
The closest he came to a church
was the Mary and Joseph Orphanage,

785
01:00:32,360 --> 01:00:35,079
where he lived from five to fifteen.

786
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,990
Then he ran away to begin a life
of crime, including convictions for...

787
01:00:41,800 --> 01:00:43,199
...shoplifting,

788
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:47,188
possession of marijuana
and grand theft auto,

789
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,153
all before the age of eighteen.

790
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:55,388
He was arrested for selling fraudulent
art works and passing bad cheques.

791
01:00:55,600 --> 01:01:00,355
If you feel you've had a good night's
entertainment, then go ahead,

792
01:01:00,560 --> 01:01:02,232
tip the dancing bear.

793
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:07,355
But, if you think this money's
going to a man of God,

794
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:10,393
you'd better think again.

795
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:11,953
I believe in Jonas.

796
01:01:27,040 --> 01:01:28,553
He's a fake!

797
01:01:28,760 --> 01:01:32,799
There ain't no way he's a man of God!

798
01:01:45,920 --> 01:01:48,388
Brother Will!

799
01:01:48,600 --> 01:01:52,229
Everything you've said is true.
Absolutely true.

800
01:01:56,360 --> 01:02:00,273
Yes, I was born to lowly circumstances.

801
01:02:00,480 --> 01:02:05,235
Yes, I ran with a bad crowd that
taught me to smoke weed and steal.

802
01:02:06,280 --> 01:02:08,635
I hung out in bars.

803
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:12,475
And I hot-wired cars.

804
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:17,196
I grew up mistreated,
so I lied and I cheated.

805
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:22,228
I learned hard crime
and I served hard time.

806
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:26,433
I have walked that crooked road
and I have danced with Satan.

807
01:02:26,640 --> 01:02:30,599
I've been down in the gutter
and looked up into the face of God.

808
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:33,268
- Praise the Lord!
- Amen!

809
01:02:33,480 --> 01:02:36,790
I say to you,
if you wanna give up the bottle,

810
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,150
who you gonna talk to?

811
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:42,079
- Someone who's never touched a drop?
- No!

812
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:45,829
If you wanna give up womanising,
who you gonna talk to?

813
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:49,430
- Some pale-skinned virgin priest?
- No!

814
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:52,154
If you wanna give up sin -

815
01:02:52,360 --> 01:02:57,309
and I believe everyone here tonight
wants to give up sin -

816
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,158
who can lead you?

817
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,316
You need a real sinner, people.

818
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:06,355
A sinner of such monumental
proportions that all your sins

819
01:03:06,560 --> 01:03:10,155
couldn't possibly equal
the sins of this King of Sin!

820
01:03:11,960 --> 01:03:15,350
Because you know,
if he can walk that righteous path,

821
01:03:15,560 --> 01:03:19,269
if he can go from grift to grace,
from sin to sanctity,

822
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:21,789
from lowliness to holiness,

823
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:26,232
that you, with all your every day sins,

824
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:29,432
can rise up like an angel

825
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:34,634
and ride that golden elevator
to God's own penthouse in the sky.

826
01:03:39,720 --> 01:03:42,632
Hey, Jake! Jake Bradley!

827
01:03:42,840 --> 01:03:45,912
The bank gave you
last warning on foreclosure.

828
01:03:46,120 --> 01:03:48,395
How much did you put in the bucket?

829
01:03:48,600 --> 01:03:50,909
$10.

830
01:03:51,120 --> 01:03:52,712
Sadie McElroy,

831
01:03:52,920 --> 01:03:57,038
you've got two boys in junior college,
your husband's out of work.

832
01:03:57,240 --> 01:04:01,313
I put in twenty, Will.
I need all the help I can get.

833
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:03,158
Amen!

834
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:07,834
I don't know what to say to you.

835
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:11,032
You folks have been warned.

836
01:04:15,000 --> 01:04:18,788
Sadie, you need all the help you can get.
You too, Jake. All of you.

837
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,753
I know what you're going through.

838
01:04:21,960 --> 01:04:24,474
But there can be no price on salvation.

839
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:29,117
So I want you to take back
all your money, every last cent.

840
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:35,919
Bring those buckets out.
Sadie take out twenty; Jake take out ten.

841
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:38,236
Go ahead.

842
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,069
Because the Lord knows
you still have doubt in your hearts.

843
01:04:42,280 --> 01:04:45,590
Without your faith,
I cannot deliver the Word.

844
01:04:45,800 --> 01:04:49,236
- Praise the Lord!
- For the Israelites, he parted the sea.

845
01:04:49,440 --> 01:04:51,829
To Moses,
he spoke from the burning bush.

846
01:04:52,040 --> 01:04:56,352
And in your hour of doubt,
the Lord has spoken to me.

847
01:04:57,360 --> 01:04:59,590
He said, "Jonas,

848
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:04,191
"Jonas, expect a sign."

849
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:11,112
And if God's wisdom is proven to you,
then may you support this ministry.

850
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,517
Because God don't want
no doubt money, no!

851
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:17,188
And I don't want no doubt money. N-O!

852
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:22,793
Because doubt money burned the fingers
of the righteous, and I will not be burned!

853
01:05:32,480 --> 01:05:34,357
- You all right?
- Of course.

854
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:37,836
Plant the twenties
before they leave.

855
01:05:41,760 --> 01:05:43,716
He'll be all right.

856
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:50,359
It's a highway up to heaven

857
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:55,196
You can't just walk up there
You've got to have a pure heart

858
01:05:55,400 --> 01:06:00,155
It's a highway up to heaven...

859
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,598
Look, Jane...

860
01:06:31,800 --> 01:06:34,997
Try grovelling.
It goes a long way with me.

861
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:41,599
- I told you I had a job to do.
- Doing your job is one thing.

862
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:45,429
Trying to destroy
a human being is another.

863
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:48,108
Nuclear winter wouldn't destroy him!

864
01:06:48,320 --> 01:06:50,197
Oh, yeah?

865
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:53,710
Let me tell you something
your snooping didn't turn up.

866
01:06:53,920 --> 01:06:57,879
Do you know
how he landed in that orphanage?

867
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:02,917
- I assume his parents died.
- His parents?

868
01:07:03,120 --> 01:07:05,395
God only knows where his father is.

869
01:07:05,600 --> 01:07:08,319
His mother took him out
shopping one day.

870
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:12,798
Told him she'd right back and
that he should wait on the corner.

871
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:17,039
Four days later, he's there waiting.

872
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:20,118
So the cops lug him off
to Our Mother of Neglect,

873
01:07:20,320 --> 01:07:24,757
where, for five years, he still believes
his mother will come to get him.

874
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,474
Finally, he just wised up.

875
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:32,515
- The jails are full of stories like that.
- Yeah. They sure are.

876
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:35,359
That's why,
if Jonas was wearing pantyhose

877
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:39,155
and pointing a rifle,
it wouldn't surprise me.

878
01:07:39,360 --> 01:07:41,351
But he's not.

879
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:45,633
All he's doing is selling fairy tales
to people who thank him.

880
01:07:45,840 --> 01:07:48,991
The last thing he needs is
a judgemental asshole like you

881
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,509
throwing his past up in his face.

882
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,752
Open up, boss. It's me.

883
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,039
This better be good.

884
01:09:57,320 --> 01:10:00,073
Excuse me. Pardon me. Excuse me.

885
01:10:00,280 --> 01:10:02,316
Pardon me. Excuse me.

886
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,272
Excuse me.

887
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:10,513
The Reverend has just arrived.

888
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,994
God bless you, Father.

889
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:23,989
Praise the Lord!

890
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:33,758
Praise the Lord! His eyes are open!

891
01:10:43,200 --> 01:10:45,350
You've outdone yourself.

892
01:10:45,560 --> 01:10:49,314
He preached last night
that God would send a sign.

893
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:51,397
I've seen a hundred signs.

894
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:56,879
A magnificent sunrise, a green light
when I thought it would turn red.

895
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,674
But never have I seen anything like this.

896
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:04,749
You were watching the tent last night.
Anybody switch crucifixes?

897
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:07,793
No, sir. Not a soul.

898
01:11:14,240 --> 01:11:16,435
Praise the Lord! It's a miracle!

899
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,039
Hallelujah!

900
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,711
An alleged miracle in Rustwater,
whose population of 22,000

901
01:11:36,920 --> 01:11:41,948
in the last few hours
has swelled to over 31,000 people.

902
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:32,954
Rumour has it
the crucifix performs miracles.

903
01:12:33,160 --> 01:12:38,712
A local man who sustained a burn said
his wound had miraculously healed.

904
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:43,118
- The question is...
- What are we doing about the rain?

905
01:12:43,320 --> 01:12:48,599
Tony's printing some pamphlets
on rain-making so we'll use them.

906
01:12:48,800 --> 01:12:51,758
There'll be some really
sick people there.

907
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,679
Seat them in the back
away from the stage.

908
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:59,749
And we have our malpractice insurance:
"Only if your faith is strong enough."

909
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:03,669
- Damn, this was a new shirt.
- Have you tried turpentine?

910
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:06,952
It's no good.
That trick's worth it, though.

911
01:13:07,160 --> 01:13:08,752
An oldie but goodie.

912
01:13:08,960 --> 01:13:12,794
- Have you had any sleep lately?
- Too busy to sleep.

913
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,151
Places to go and people to do.

914
01:13:19,480 --> 01:13:21,550
How's the badge taking all this?

915
01:13:21,760 --> 01:13:24,558
I heard he couldn't get
an art expert till Tuesday.

916
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:30,039
You heard? Little lovers' tiff?
Wonder how he got so well-informed.

917
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:35,155
Screw you.
I'm not the one giving out free samples.

918
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:41,516
I just feel bad is all,
these people are so broke.

919
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:45,599
You feel bad for the poor people
but you want their money.

920
01:13:45,800 --> 01:13:48,519
What's a girl to do?

921
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:52,918
Move to Kansas?
Marry old Will and slop the hogs?

922
01:13:53,120 --> 01:13:55,315
You can't have it both ways.

923
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:59,479
I don't believe I defended you.
I'm tired of manipulators.

924
01:13:59,680 --> 01:14:02,797
Manipulators are sneaky. I'm obvious.

925
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,353
And right!

926
01:14:16,600 --> 01:14:19,637
You feeling better now?

927
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:24,072
Yeah. I guess I just needed to be alone.

928
01:14:26,520 --> 01:14:29,557
I'll take that as a compliment.

929
01:14:32,640 --> 01:14:36,599
- It's before six. I've gotta go.
- Whoa!

930
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:40,469
Places to go, people to rip off.

931
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,150
Oh, you should talk.
You're consorting with the enemy.

932
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:47,670
Well, I'm an easy consort.

933
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,991
You ever think about settling down?

934
01:15:01,160 --> 01:15:04,277
My mother taught me never to settle.

935
01:15:04,480 --> 01:15:09,110
You're fast on your feet, Jane,
but someday you may wanna slow down.

936
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,833
No.

937
01:15:11,040 --> 01:15:13,759
Sorry, Will. I don't do slow.

938
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:21,390
Come on. I want to show you something.

939
01:15:23,840 --> 01:15:27,799
They travel over two thousand miles
and end up here,

940
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:31,037
back with the same mate,
year after year.

941
01:15:31,240 --> 01:15:34,789
What are you talking about?
I don't see anything.

942
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:39,471
They started arriving last week.
There's only a few thousand right now.

943
01:15:39,680 --> 01:15:42,877
What started arriving?
I don't see anything.

944
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:44,672
Watch.

945
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,550
Ain't they beautiful?

946
01:16:07,960 --> 01:16:11,032
- Oh, they like me.
- Fantastic!

947
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:19,798
Jane, I'm not a flashy guy,
but what I promise I deliver.

948
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:25,717
- I'd like to make you some promises.
- You've known me three days!

949
01:16:25,920 --> 01:16:28,559
I'm a quick study.

950
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:38,758
By Tuesday, you'll be gone.

951
01:16:38,960 --> 01:16:41,713
If I had more time, I'd take it.

952
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:55,119
Why don't you come tonight?
Lt'll be fun.

953
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,197
The crew has a bet going.

954
01:16:57,400 --> 01:17:00,995
Everybody had to come up
with some ridiculous word.

955
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:06,399
Jonas has to work them into his sermon,
and if he fails, you win the pot.

956
01:17:06,600 --> 01:17:08,670
Guess what my phrase is.

957
01:17:08,880 --> 01:17:11,474
Aluminum siding.

958
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:13,989
Aluminum siding!

959
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:17,237
You can get caught up in the frills of life!

960
01:17:17,440 --> 01:17:19,715
Samsonite luggage,
the Amana washer.

961
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:23,117
But you know
what's really important, don't you?

962
01:17:23,320 --> 01:17:25,072
Are you ready for the truth?

963
01:17:25,280 --> 01:17:27,236
Are you ready for the Word?

964
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:30,034
We gotta get back
to that old-time religion.

965
01:17:30,240 --> 01:17:31,958
Where is she?

966
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,550
All right. What if I told you
one good deed returns ten good ones?

967
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:40,352
Would you believe me?

968
01:17:40,560 --> 01:17:44,917
If I told you that one righteous day
would return ten days of fortune?

969
01:17:45,120 --> 01:17:46,792
Would you believe me?

970
01:17:47,000 --> 01:17:51,596
What if I told you $1 in the service
of the Lord would return ten-fold?

971
01:17:51,800 --> 01:17:54,268
- Would you believe me?
- Yes!

972
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:58,678
- Yo, I'm here.
- It's about time... for a miracle!

973
01:17:58,880 --> 01:18:03,829
- I believe, brother, I believe!
- What is it? Come up here.

974
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,633
- What's your name?
- Calvin Tweedy.

975
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:09,114
Go ahead.

976
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:15,555
Last night, I only had $10 in my wallet
and my wife Kate made me give it all.

977
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,557
God bless you, Kate!

978
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,479
Then you said to take it back and I did.

979
01:18:20,680 --> 01:18:25,754
But this morning I had $30,
and I had no $20 bill before that.

980
01:18:25,960 --> 01:18:28,269
Well, hallelujah! It's a miracle!

981
01:18:28,480 --> 01:18:31,313
- It happened to me, too!
- I got forty!

982
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,389
Hallelujah, it's a miracle!
Turn it loose, Bruce, and get back, Jack!

983
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:40,275
Rustwater, Kansas,
is some kind of holy town.

984
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:45,076
I've never seen such a demonstration
of the Lord's plenty. Say, "Amen!"

985
01:18:45,280 --> 01:18:47,635
Say, "Hallelujah!"

986
01:18:47,840 --> 01:18:51,594
All right, let's give some empty lives
a little meaning!

987
01:18:54,440 --> 01:18:56,908
I believe we'll see
some miracles tonight.

988
01:18:57,120 --> 01:18:59,554
Come on up,
I'm working for Jesus!

989
01:18:59,760 --> 01:19:04,276
He's coming through me,
special delivery! Hallelujah!

990
01:19:06,760 --> 01:19:10,753
A fever is on me! A fever is on me!

991
01:19:10,960 --> 01:19:13,394
Do you hear him call?

992
01:19:15,040 --> 01:19:18,350
Fall into the spirit of Jesus Christ!

993
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,074
Prepare to receive your miracle!

994
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:26,069
Oh, I'm feeling the power tonight!
I'm feeling the power!

995
01:19:26,280 --> 01:19:28,271
Invite him in, sisters!

996
01:19:28,480 --> 01:19:31,950
Somebody has just
been cured of their rheumatism.

997
01:19:32,160 --> 01:19:35,630
Receive a fresh anointing!
Watch out, I'm vibrating!

998
01:19:35,840 --> 01:19:39,310
I'm vibrating, I'm vibrating with Jesus!

999
01:19:40,760 --> 01:19:43,479
I'm feeling the power!
Come on, brother!

1000
01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:47,309
Let Jesus in.
He's speaking the language of the Lord!

1001
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:50,830
The language of the Lord! Hallelujah!

1002
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:54,029
Fall into Jesus!

1003
01:19:54,240 --> 01:19:56,879
The Angels of Mercy!

1004
01:19:57,080 --> 01:19:59,674
I'm boxing for Jesus!

1005
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,793
This room is burning up
with the fever of the Lord!

1006
01:20:04,000 --> 01:20:05,558
Hallelujah, brother!

1007
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,835
Hey, Reverend. Hey, Rev!

1008
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:12,430
Hey, Rev, what about me?

1009
01:20:14,080 --> 01:20:16,435
I've no more healing power left in me.

1010
01:20:16,640 --> 01:20:19,871
- Rev, what about me?
- That's it!

1011
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:24,471
I'm all done in from the service
to the Lord! Thank you, Jesus!

1012
01:20:24,680 --> 01:20:29,231
Dance, brother, dance!
Celebrate the miracles of the Lord!

1013
01:20:29,440 --> 01:20:32,432
- Another one!
- What about Boyd?

1014
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:35,393
One more! One more!

1015
01:20:39,880 --> 01:20:41,916
So glad you could make it.

1016
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,715
I had to cold read twenty people
and I was not brilliant.

1017
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,070
One more! One more!

1018
01:20:48,280 --> 01:20:51,238
I think you've got a little problem here.

1019
01:20:51,440 --> 01:20:53,749
One more! One more!

1020
01:20:53,960 --> 01:20:58,317
Take it from me, babe,
"You can't have it both ways."

1021
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,080
One more! One more!

1022
01:21:01,280 --> 01:21:04,033
One more! One more!

1023
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:16,149
One more! One more!

1024
01:21:16,360 --> 01:21:19,158
One more! One more!

1025
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,750
Hallelujah!

1026
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,837
You asked for one more demonstration
of the Lord's kindness, a show of faith.

1027
01:21:43,040 --> 01:21:47,318
It's about faith. You gotta have it
or you can't get healed.

1028
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,911
If there's any doubt in your hearts,
the Lord cannot deliver.

1029
01:21:52,120 --> 01:21:56,875
Even if one of you doubts, like you,
Will. I know you have doubts.

1030
01:21:57,080 --> 01:22:01,710
You must believe, because this boy's
chances of walking are in your hands.

1031
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:03,194
Amen!

1032
01:23:01,920 --> 01:23:04,912
Brothers and sisters,
I ask you to consider

1033
01:23:05,120 --> 01:23:09,557
the fate of an innocent
rests in the heart of a cynic.

1034
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,598
You can do it. You can do it.

1035
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:50,510
Release your faith!

1036
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,395
Hallelujah! Another miracle!

1037
01:24:19,600 --> 01:24:22,433
Have faith in Jesus! Faith in Jesus!

1038
01:24:32,480 --> 01:24:35,074
- Amen!
- Hallelujah!

1039
01:24:49,080 --> 01:24:51,799
How did you do it, Reverend?

1040
01:24:53,280 --> 01:24:54,759
Son of a bitch!

1041
01:25:23,400 --> 01:25:26,836
Are you gonna tell me
what really happened out there?

1042
01:25:27,040 --> 01:25:29,679
I've been had. I've been hustled.

1043
01:25:29,880 --> 01:25:31,950
What are you talking about?

1044
01:25:32,160 --> 01:25:34,833
They got a great act,
the waitress and Tiny Tim!

1045
01:25:35,040 --> 01:25:38,635
That story about the trucker,
a drunken trucker.

1046
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:43,311
- Details, the mark of a great con!
- Forget it. Not those two.

1047
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:46,195
They're not like you.

1048
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,198
Come on.

1049
01:25:49,400 --> 01:25:52,676
Remember me?
I'm Jane, your partner in crime.

1050
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,838
Did you see them?
They're going out of their minds.

1051
01:25:56,040 --> 01:25:59,316
I had to clear the tent
or they'd have torn it down.

1052
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:03,752
- You should see the money coming in.
- By this time tomorrow...

1053
01:26:03,960 --> 01:26:06,315
...we're gonna be on every TV station.

1054
01:26:06,520 --> 01:26:11,036
- We can play New Orleans...
- Tell me the truth.

1055
01:26:11,240 --> 01:26:15,279
What is this,
an elaborate set-up or what?

1056
01:26:15,480 --> 01:26:17,471
What do you think?

1057
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,676
Holy shit!

1058
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,953
Jonas, I gotta hand it to you.
Getting that kid was genius!

1059
01:26:25,160 --> 01:26:29,995
Give that kid a haircut,
put him in some fancy clothes on stage!

1060
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,556
- That's money in the bank!
- Maybe he can re-enact it.

1061
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:37,196
Do you know what we could bring in
in Dallas in one week?

1062
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:38,674
Seven figures!

1063
01:26:38,880 --> 01:26:43,715
Seven figures, man!
Jonas, man, what do you think?

1064
01:26:48,160 --> 01:26:50,355
Come on, Jonas.

1065
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:58,713
- Do it!
- You're a genius, man!

1066
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,194
Genius!

1067
01:27:01,080 --> 01:27:02,354
Jonas, wait!

1068
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:06,599
Listen. We made a lot of money
and until now it's been great.

1069
01:27:06,800 --> 01:27:10,031
- But this is different.
- Come on, Jane.

1070
01:27:10,240 --> 01:27:13,277
No! That is not one of our shills in there.

1071
01:27:13,480 --> 01:27:15,994
I don't know what,
but something happened.

1072
01:27:16,200 --> 01:27:20,113
- You're right about that.
- You can't take this away from him.

1073
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:24,916
- You can't make him into a sideshow.
- You think not?

1074
01:27:25,120 --> 01:27:30,240
Wow! You really don't give a shit
about anybody, do you?

1075
01:27:30,440 --> 01:27:33,113
Janey, I never pretended I did.

1076
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,754
God, you're right.

1077
01:27:35,960 --> 01:27:39,714
You never did.
You still don't care who you hurt.

1078
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,036
See how this feels.

1079
01:27:47,600 --> 01:27:49,158
Jane!

1080
01:27:51,680 --> 01:27:53,636
Janey!

1081
01:28:29,480 --> 01:28:31,152
Hey, boss.

1082
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:35,473
Remember me? Jack Newton.

1083
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:38,511
Got a question for you.

1084
01:28:40,320 --> 01:28:43,596
Why did you make so many suckers?

1085
01:28:57,520 --> 01:28:59,954
You say, "Love never endeth."

1086
01:29:00,160 --> 01:29:03,197
Well, I say, "Love never starteth!"

1087
01:29:03,400 --> 01:29:05,470
"The meek shall inherit the earth."

1088
01:29:05,680 --> 01:29:08,592
The meek just get
the short end of the stick!

1089
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:12,713
You say, "Is anyone pure of heart?"
I say, "Not one!"

1090
01:29:12,920 --> 01:29:14,831
Rev?

1091
01:29:20,200 --> 01:29:22,191
Hello, Boyd.

1092
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,876
Why aren't you out
signing autographs? Or dancing?

1093
01:29:28,240 --> 01:29:30,800
I need to ask you a question.

1094
01:29:33,160 --> 01:29:36,232
I wanted to know
when you planned to leave town.

1095
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:39,671
Leave? A couple of days, I guess.

1096
01:29:44,360 --> 01:29:48,114
Well, I wanted to know
if I could go with you.

1097
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:52,516
- Well...
- I can do things. I'll earn my keep.

1098
01:29:54,160 --> 01:29:58,039
You're too old
to be running away with the circus.

1099
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:00,629
No, it's not that.

1100
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:06,278
Look, you made me walk again.
Many people tried that, but they couldn't.

1101
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,553
Hold it, kid.
I had nothing to do with you walking.

1102
01:30:10,760 --> 01:30:12,318
Sure you did.

1103
01:30:12,520 --> 01:30:18,197
I run a show here. A lot of smoke
and noise strictly for the suckers!

1104
01:30:18,400 --> 01:30:21,358
I've been pulling scams
since I was your age.

1105
01:30:21,560 --> 01:30:25,633
If there's one thing I know,
it's how to spot the genuine article.

1106
01:30:25,840 --> 01:30:28,274
That's what you gotta watch out for.

1107
01:30:28,480 --> 01:30:33,031
Not the cops.
You can always get around the cops.

1108
01:30:33,240 --> 01:30:37,074
But what you can never get around
is the genuine article.

1109
01:30:37,280 --> 01:30:40,829
And you, kid, are the genuine article.

1110
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:46,759
- Are you saying you think you're a fake?
- I know I'm a fake.

1111
01:30:46,960 --> 01:30:51,476
What difference does it make,
if you get the job done?

1112
01:30:51,680 --> 01:30:56,470
Kid, it makes
all the difference in the world.

1113
01:30:59,400 --> 01:31:00,992
Boyd?

1114
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:08,274
Everyone's looking for you.

1115
01:31:08,480 --> 01:31:09,754
OK.

1116
01:31:11,360 --> 01:31:14,193
Well, what do you think?

1117
01:31:15,760 --> 01:31:17,910
All right, kid, I'll tell you what.

1118
01:31:18,120 --> 01:31:22,033
I'll meet you in front of the diner
at ten in the morning.

1119
01:31:30,160 --> 01:31:32,469
So I'll see you then?

1120
01:31:35,880 --> 01:31:38,758
I'll be back in a minute.

1121
01:31:45,200 --> 01:31:47,760
I want to thank you.

1122
01:31:48,800 --> 01:31:51,519
I don't know why my brother's walking,

1123
01:31:51,720 --> 01:31:55,235
but I'll be grateful for the rest of my life.

1124
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:02,797
Marva?

1125
01:32:04,120 --> 01:32:09,148
Ten in the morning, your brother's
gonna be standing in front of the diner.

1126
01:32:09,360 --> 01:32:13,114
- Give him a message for me?
- Yeah.

1127
01:32:15,520 --> 01:32:20,674
Tell him that just because
a person didn't show up,

1128
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:25,078
doesn't mean that the person
doesn't care about him.

1129
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,472
You read it?
OK, we'll go over it again.

1130
01:33:23,680 --> 01:33:27,309
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want..."

1131
01:33:28,760 --> 01:33:32,673
Here you go.
Come back for seconds.

1132
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,473
Jane. You OK?

1133
01:34:31,680 --> 01:34:33,432
Hi.

1134
01:36:15,440 --> 01:36:16,839
Thanks.

1135
01:36:25,160 --> 01:36:27,993
Souvenir of someone I once knew.

1136
01:36:29,480 --> 01:36:32,995
- Where are you headed?
- Pensacola, Florida.

1137
01:36:33,200 --> 01:36:35,509
Never been there.

1138
01:36:38,400 --> 01:36:42,154
- Are you in some kind of trouble?
- No, no, no.

1139
01:36:42,360 --> 01:36:44,430
No, sir.

1140
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:47,916
Maybe for the first time in my life I'm not.

1141
01:36:54,440 --> 01:36:57,273
Well, damn! Would you look at that?

1142
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:35,032
Yes, sir!

1143
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:38,197
Yes, sir!

1144
01:39:25,920 --> 01:39:28,115
Praise Jesus!

1145
01:39:41,000 --> 01:39:43,150
Come on, baby!

1146
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:46,193
Come on, baby, rain!

1147
01:39:46,400 --> 01:39:47,879
Rain!

1148
01:39:48,080 --> 01:39:50,310
Thank you, Jesus!

1149
01:39:51,310 --> 01:40:01,310
