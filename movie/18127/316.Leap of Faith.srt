1
00:00:06,323 --> 00:00:08,257
And I'm asking this

2
00:00:08,292 --> 00:00:10,692
even though Patrice and I had
a great Christmas together

3
00:00:10,728 --> 00:00:12,761
staying right here in L.A.

4
00:00:12,797 --> 00:00:14,897
Gotta love this city.

5
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:17,299
No matter how many people
leave for the holidays,

6
00:00:17,334 --> 00:00:19,635
traffic still blows.

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,404
- Stop ducking my question.
- I'm not ducking your question.

8
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:25,207
My situation with the captain is

9
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:27,476
completely different
than yours with Patrice.

10
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:29,578
So she's the captain again now, huh?

11
00:00:29,613 --> 00:00:31,613
Okay, I'll answer your stupid question.

12
00:00:31,649 --> 00:00:34,516
You don't stop dating someone
because it's going well.

13
00:00:34,552 --> 00:00:37,886
And if Sharon and I were dating,

14
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:40,756
- which we're not...
- Which you are, but... never mind.

15
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:42,891
I wouldn't worry about our future

16
00:00:42,927 --> 00:00:45,761
just because I disappointed
some people in the past.

17
00:00:45,796 --> 00:00:48,530
Except for some reason that no one...

18
00:00:48,566 --> 00:00:51,333
Including myself... can understand,

19
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:54,903
I always seem to hurt women's feelings.

20
00:00:54,939 --> 00:00:57,739
So... why go on...

21
00:00:57,775 --> 00:01:00,976
If there's only
one way that it can end?

22
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:04,346
Hey, sounds like all hell
is breaking loose out there.

23
00:01:04,381 --> 00:01:06,348
- You got that right.
- I'll call you back.

24
00:01:06,383 --> 00:01:08,951
Hold on... hey!
Flynn! Where are you?

25
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:18,560
Why go on?

26
00:01:27,841 --> 00:01:33,731

27
00:01:33,931 --> 00:01:35,377
What do you got?

28
00:01:35,412 --> 00:01:37,813
Guy ready to do a triple
gainer with a twist, sir.

29
00:01:37,848 --> 00:01:39,715
Right onto the freeway. Over there.

30
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,284
We're waiting on a crisis counselor.

31
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,287
1056A reported on an overpass.

32
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:47,723
Officer assistance
required for road closure.

33
00:01:47,758 --> 00:01:50,325
110 southbound.

34
00:02:06,744 --> 00:02:08,844
How you doing, buddy?

35
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:11,046
Can we talk?

36
00:02:12,850 --> 00:02:14,950
Can I talk to you?

37
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:16,718
I'm Andy Flynn. What's your name?

38
00:02:16,754 --> 00:02:18,053
Leave me alone.

39
00:02:18,088 --> 00:02:19,655
All right, but at least let me know

40
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:21,957
who I'm talking to.

41
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:24,059
Bill.

42
00:02:24,094 --> 00:02:25,561
My...

43
00:02:25,596 --> 00:02:26,828
My name is Bill.

44
00:02:26,864 --> 00:02:30,832
Just... would you give me a moment, please?

45
00:02:30,868 --> 00:02:33,368
Okay, Bill, but you got
to give me a moment, too.

46
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:35,604
You don't want to hurt anybody else, do you?

47
00:02:35,639 --> 00:02:37,673
Easy, easy, Bill. Listen.

48
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:38,941
You jump, you're gonna cause

49
00:02:38,976 --> 00:02:40,442
a big accident down there,

50
00:02:40,477 --> 00:02:42,744
and innocent people are gonna die.

51
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,479
You don't want that, do you?

52
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:45,747
Wait.

53
00:02:45,783 --> 00:02:49,484
You gotta know, it wasn't my fault.

54
00:02:52,856 --> 00:02:55,357
Oh, man, then I can help you.

55
00:02:55,392 --> 00:02:58,727
Look, I've been where you are.

56
00:02:58,762 --> 00:03:00,596
Wanting to call it quits.

57
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,333
But it's not the answer, buddy.

58
00:03:04,368 --> 00:03:07,769
Look, listen to me.
Life is temporary.

59
00:03:07,805 --> 00:03:09,071
Dead is forever.

60
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:11,373
No, come on, you don't want that, do you?

61
00:03:11,408 --> 00:03:13,976
Give me your hand. Bill!

62
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,879
Come on. Bill, take my hand, man.

63
00:03:17,915 --> 00:03:20,015
Yeah, that's... that's it.
I got you. I got you.

64
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:21,883
Come on, that's right. Atta-way.

65
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:24,753
You got it. Yeah, that's it.

66
00:03:24,788 --> 00:03:28,090
Hey. Hey, good man.

67
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,491
Way to go.

68
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:31,893
Oh, whoa, whoa. Okay.

69
00:03:31,929 --> 00:03:33,462
Come on, have a seat. That's...

70
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,933
Good job.

71
00:03:37,968 --> 00:03:40,402
That was step one.

72
00:03:40,437 --> 00:03:42,738
Now let's figure out step two, okay?

73
00:03:42,773 --> 00:03:45,574
What's your last name, Bill?

74
00:03:45,609 --> 00:03:46,908
George.

75
00:03:48,045 --> 00:03:49,878
You have any I.D. on you?

76
00:03:51,849 --> 00:03:55,617
I left my wallet in the truck.

77
00:04:31,855 --> 00:04:36,091
William Scott George, age
31, registered sex offender.

78
00:04:36,126 --> 00:04:37,993
Served two years and two
months in Delano State Prison

79
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:39,861
for unlawful sex with a minor.

80
00:04:39,897 --> 00:04:42,064
Yeah, now he's
graduated to murder.

81
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:44,466
In his prior, he slipped a 16-year-old

82
00:04:44,501 --> 00:04:47,536
a few drinks before taking
her back to his place.

83
00:04:47,571 --> 00:04:51,473
Yeah. Picked a charming
lad to save, Father Flynn.

84
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:53,175
What was I supposed to do, push him?

85
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,178
Well, not into traffic. All
right. Who's the victim?

86
00:04:56,213 --> 00:04:58,747
Suicidal dirtbag says he doesn't know.

87
00:04:58,782 --> 00:05:00,682
No I.D. in her pajamas.

88
00:05:00,718 --> 00:05:02,517
God. Pajamas.

89
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,487
Rigor's just barely setting in.
I'd say three or four hours.

90
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:09,124
Time of death somewhere
between 4:45 and 5:45 A.M.

91
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:12,694
No visible bruising or wounds.
Nothing defensive.

92
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:16,598
Left wrist has some ligature markings.

93
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,600
- Like she was bound?
- Not sure.

94
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:20,068
Nothing on the right wrist.

95
00:05:20,104 --> 00:05:22,471
Visually? Hard to give
the girl's cause of death.

96
00:05:22,506 --> 00:05:23,972
So he was trying to kill himself

97
00:05:24,007 --> 00:05:25,640
because she died of natural causes?

98
00:05:25,676 --> 00:05:27,743
Hey. I call 'em as I see 'em.

99
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:30,011
Buzz. Hey, check this out.

100
00:05:30,047 --> 00:05:32,547
Our guy likes to party a little.

101
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,684
Our molester travels prepared.

102
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:37,085
Gross.

103
00:05:38,989 --> 00:05:42,524
Before Sanchez brought Bill's
truck to the print shed,

104
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:45,961
we found this parking pass
stuffed under the driver's seat

105
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:47,996
dated yesterday, but no address.

106
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,799
- Maybe he has another place.
- As a sex offender,

107
00:05:50,834 --> 00:05:54,102
he's required to register every
residence with the State.

108
00:05:54,138 --> 00:05:56,872
Shocking that he didn't follow the rules.

109
00:05:56,907 --> 00:05:59,174
My two cents... He was willing to die

110
00:05:59,209 --> 00:06:02,010
rather than I.D. the victim, because...

111
00:06:02,045 --> 00:06:03,779
He knows her family.

112
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:05,781
Or he just happened to grab some girl

113
00:06:05,816 --> 00:06:07,082
wandering through his neighborhood

114
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,483
dressed in her pajamas.

115
00:06:08,519 --> 00:06:09,951
Seems unlikely.

116
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:12,254
To even think about a
deal in this situation,

117
00:06:12,289 --> 00:06:15,857
Mr. George needs to tell us what happened.

118
00:06:15,893 --> 00:06:18,093
Bill, I promised
that I would help you,

119
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:19,594
and I'm doing that.

120
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,062
But you have to help me and Sharon out

121
00:06:21,098 --> 00:06:22,697
a little, too, okay?

122
00:06:22,733 --> 00:06:25,066
So look. Now that you've
had some time to think...

123
00:06:25,102 --> 00:06:27,636
I don't know the girl.

124
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:30,572
I told you I don't know her.

125
00:06:30,607 --> 00:06:32,674
Bill, I've been doing this a long time,

126
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:35,577
and I'm aware that things
aren't always what they seem.

127
00:06:35,612 --> 00:06:38,947
We don't even have a cause of
death on this young lady yet.

128
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:40,649
It could be that she passed away

129
00:06:40,684 --> 00:06:42,150
from natural causes

130
00:06:42,186 --> 00:06:44,085
during a sleepover.

131
00:06:44,121 --> 00:06:46,221
I could see why that would make you nervous.

132
00:06:46,256 --> 00:06:47,889
This is why I wanted to jump.

133
00:06:47,925 --> 00:06:50,826
It doesn't matter what the hell I tell you.

134
00:06:50,861 --> 00:06:52,794
You are never gonna believe me.

135
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,262
You're wrong about that, Bill.

136
00:06:54,298 --> 00:06:56,231
I want to believe you, and Andy does, too.

137
00:06:56,266 --> 00:06:58,967
I did not know this girl!

138
00:06:59,002 --> 00:07:00,569
I did not know her!

139
00:07:00,604 --> 00:07:01,937
Okay, okay!

140
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:04,072
Just tell us how she came to be

141
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:06,541
in the back of your truck,
and we'll go from there.

142
00:07:06,577 --> 00:07:10,078
I work the graveyard shift at the paper.

143
00:07:10,113 --> 00:07:12,080
It's one of my jobs.

144
00:07:12,115 --> 00:07:15,550
And on mondays when
"L.A. Sexy's" run is ready,

145
00:07:15,586 --> 00:07:20,722
I deliver it to all the
boxes from 3:00 A.M. to 6:30.

146
00:07:20,757 --> 00:07:24,926
And then, this morning, when I got home...

147
00:07:26,096 --> 00:07:27,762
There she was,

148
00:07:27,798 --> 00:07:30,198
on the bed like that.

149
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:32,868
I'll verify his employment
in the porn industry.

150
00:07:32,903 --> 00:07:34,302
Yeah, and see where Sykes is

151
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:35,937
with the warrant for his house.

152
00:07:35,973 --> 00:07:38,139
He seems determined to be unhelpful.

153
00:07:38,175 --> 00:07:41,843
You come home to find a
strange girl dead in your bed,

154
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,645
and you don't think to call us?

155
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,181
I lost it. Okay?

156
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:49,985
I-it's tough living where I do.

157
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,820
People have started throwing rocks

158
00:07:51,855 --> 00:07:54,222
through my windows, egging my truck.

159
00:07:54,258 --> 00:07:57,926
I am an ex-con and a sex offender.

160
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,730
That's not a cop-friendly bio.

161
00:08:01,765 --> 00:08:04,232
Right. So you carried the girl's body

162
00:08:04,268 --> 00:08:06,234
out of your house, and you placed her

163
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:08,036
in the back of your pickup.

164
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:10,672
Where were you taking her?

165
00:08:10,707 --> 00:08:13,808
I don't know. I couldn't figure that out.

166
00:08:13,844 --> 00:08:16,211
And so you decided to kill yourself

167
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,246
over a girl you never met?

168
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,924
I did... I didn't know her.

169
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:33,028
I didn't know the girl.

170
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:38,066
Why don't we send you back
to your house with Andy,

171
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,868
and you can walk him through what happened,

172
00:08:39,903 --> 00:08:41,369
and we'll try and document it.

173
00:08:41,405 --> 00:08:44,239
Yeah. You think you can
do that with me, Bill?

174
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,892
Hey,

175
00:09:03,927 --> 00:09:06,695
isn't that Robby Oderno
from missing persons?

176
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:09,197
- What's he doing here?
- Yeah, and who's he talking to?

177
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:12,000
Hey, Bill, have you ever
seen those people before?

178
00:09:12,035 --> 00:09:14,336
- No, I-I don't know them.
- Flynn, Flynn, come on.

179
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:17,238
All right, you sit tight.

180
00:09:17,274 --> 00:09:19,674
Hey, Oderno!

181
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,942
Oderno!

182
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,911
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.
- What's the deal?

183
00:09:22,946 --> 00:09:24,679
What... are you looking for somebody?

184
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:27,349
Yeah, Mr. and Mrs. O'Hara's
16-year-old daughter Annie

185
00:09:27,384 --> 00:09:29,084
disappeared from home last night.

186
00:09:29,119 --> 00:09:30,852
A little early for missing
persons to be involved.

187
00:09:30,887 --> 00:09:33,088
She's autistic and given to wandering.

188
00:09:33,123 --> 00:09:34,956
She wears a G.P.S. bracelet,

189
00:09:34,992 --> 00:09:36,958
which according to the mother's iPad,

190
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:38,360
is pinging from in there.

191
00:09:38,395 --> 00:09:40,228
Yeah, that's okay, Robby. We found her.

192
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:42,430
Uh, we also have a warrant for the house.

193
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,299
Oh, God.

194
00:09:44,334 --> 00:09:46,901
Excuse me. Look, I'm sorry,
but my daughter is in there.

195
00:09:46,937 --> 00:09:48,970
Now either you're gonna have
to do something about it,

196
00:09:49,006 --> 00:09:51,206
- or we will.
- You can't just wait outside this guy's place.

197
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:52,841
Well, how do you know who lives here?

198
00:09:52,876 --> 00:09:54,075
Well, everybody in the neighborhood knows

199
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:55,377
the guy's a registered sex offender.

200
00:09:55,412 --> 00:09:57,178
Can't you guys just break down the door?

201
00:09:57,214 --> 00:09:58,947
- Oh, my God.
- Do you have a picture of your daughter

202
00:09:58,982 --> 00:10:00,315
- we can see, ma'am?
- Yeah. Yeah.

203
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:03,518
Uh, her name is, uh, Annie. There you go.

204
00:10:06,056 --> 00:10:09,157
Do you mind if, uh, we keep this for a bit?

205
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:12,093
- Oh, that's fine.
- Mr. and Mrs. O'Hara, come with me, please.

206
00:10:12,129 --> 00:10:13,428
Come on.

207
00:10:13,463 --> 00:10:15,397
Sweep and clear,

208
00:10:15,432 --> 00:10:18,099
and I will take care of the parents.

209
00:10:18,135 --> 00:10:19,934
- Could you record this, please?
- Yes, sir.

210
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:21,836
Buzz...

211
00:10:21,872 --> 00:10:24,806
Wait. How did... how did you
have the keys to his house?

212
00:10:24,841 --> 00:10:27,008
- Well, just stay calm, ma'am.
- He has the keys to his house!

213
00:10:27,044 --> 00:10:28,309
- No, that's all right.
- Jen.

214
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:30,078
- It's okay.
- That's him.

215
00:10:30,113 --> 00:10:31,980
- What?
- That's the guy in the back seat right there!

216
00:10:32,015 --> 00:10:33,381
Hey, you bastard! Hey!

217
00:10:33,417 --> 00:10:34,849
What did you do to her?!

218
00:10:34,885 --> 00:10:36,317
You sick bastard!

219
00:10:36,353 --> 00:10:37,552
What did you do to my
daughter? Where is she?

220
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,220
Hey! You need to be calm, please!

221
00:10:39,256 --> 00:10:43,024
Calm down, please!

222
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:46,227
If you hurt my baby, I will kill you!

223
00:10:46,263 --> 00:10:47,829
- Kill you!
- All right.

224
00:10:47,864 --> 00:10:50,865
I'm fine! I'm fine. I'm fine.

225
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:10,309
Oh! What are you doing here?

226
00:11:10,344 --> 00:11:12,211
I locked my keys in my car.

227
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:14,780
Okay. I'll get you mine.

228
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,715
- Thank you.
- How'd it go with Emma?

229
00:11:16,751 --> 00:11:19,718
Is there something new
about the Phillip Stroh case?

230
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:22,755
Uh, yeah. He... He fired his attorney,

231
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,423
and... and now he's going, um...

232
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,892
- Pro-per.
- Does that mean representing himself?

233
00:11:26,928 --> 00:11:28,160
- Yes.
- That's it then.

234
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:30,162
Yes, he's going pro-per,

235
00:11:30,197 --> 00:11:32,398
and he's trying to give up information

236
00:11:32,433 --> 00:11:34,199
on people he's defended... Stroh is...

237
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,802
so that Emma will take the
death penalty off the table

238
00:11:36,837 --> 00:11:38,470
and there won't be a trial.

239
00:11:38,506 --> 00:11:40,272
But everything he wants to tell her,

240
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:43,208
- Stroh has to run by a, uh...
- Special master.

241
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:46,045
Yeah. Yeah, to see what's
privileged and what isn't.

242
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,381
Anyway, if he ends up giving information

243
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:52,151
to Emma that she wants, I'm done.

244
00:11:52,186 --> 00:11:53,986
Mm.

245
00:11:55,222 --> 00:11:57,489
What?

246
00:11:57,525 --> 00:12:00,392
Um, I'm glad about the deal.

247
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:02,861
And I was just wondering why Emma

248
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:05,130
didn't talk to me about it... too.

249
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,833
Well, maybe because she's irritated

250
00:12:07,868 --> 00:12:09,768
I'm still living with you.

251
00:12:09,804 --> 00:12:11,737
I mean, I'm pretty sure
instead of Santa Monica,

252
00:12:11,772 --> 00:12:13,272
she wanted me to go to college in, like,

253
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:15,874
- New Zealand or something like that.
- Mm-hmm.

254
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,509
Oh, uh, but since I am here,

255
00:12:17,545 --> 00:12:19,778
she wants me to write an impact statement.

256
00:12:19,814 --> 00:12:22,414
Ah. An impact statement.

257
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,750
Yes? Come in.

258
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:26,919
- Oh...
- Oh, excuse me.

259
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:28,921
Oh, my God, it's like you
have radar or something.

260
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:30,856
Don't worry, I'm not here for you.

261
00:12:30,891 --> 00:12:32,491
I'll see you Thursday like always.

262
00:12:32,526 --> 00:12:34,827
Your mother said there was something

263
00:12:34,862 --> 00:12:36,829
she wanted me to see from a suspect's house.

264
00:12:36,864 --> 00:12:38,897
Yes. These.

265
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:40,866
Red paper hearts.

266
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:42,468
They're all handmade.

267
00:12:42,503 --> 00:12:45,904
We found about 20 of them on
our suspect's refrigerator,

268
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:48,307
each with a little message, like this one...

269
00:12:48,342 --> 00:12:53,078
"Have a great day. XOXO." Written in crayon.

270
00:12:53,114 --> 00:12:57,216
You know, maybe he had Annie
thinking that she loved him.

271
00:12:57,251 --> 00:13:00,019
Given our victim's autism,
our question is this...

272
00:13:00,054 --> 00:13:04,056
Could she have made and
written these cards by herself?

273
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:05,791
Autism exists on a broad spectrum.

274
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,793
Some kids are almost fully functional.

275
00:13:07,828 --> 00:13:09,995
Some are... unreachable.

276
00:13:10,031 --> 00:13:13,232
Annie's file says she was
wearing a G.P.S. alert bracelet

277
00:13:13,267 --> 00:13:15,067
with a Q.R. code containing
her medical history.

278
00:13:15,102 --> 00:13:17,503
Right here, doc. Let's see.

279
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:19,972
Contact info for her family.

280
00:13:20,007 --> 00:13:22,975
Records of pediatrician visits.

281
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,277
A note about ways to
calm her if she's agitated.

282
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,446
It recommends prone restraint to hold her

283
00:13:27,481 --> 00:13:29,381
and soft whispers to calm her.

284
00:13:29,417 --> 00:13:31,817
All fairly typical. Well.

285
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:33,352
I'm not sure if she wrote on these cards,

286
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:35,154
but she didn't make them.

287
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,856
You wouldn't hand this girl
sharp objects like scissors.

288
00:13:37,892 --> 00:13:40,926
But since she was a wanderer,

289
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:43,262
maybe your suspect had seen her out before.

290
00:13:43,297 --> 00:13:45,264
Or she was leaving to meet him.

291
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:47,199
You found the bracelet broken?

292
00:13:47,234 --> 00:13:49,468
And tossed underneath the suspect's bed.

293
00:13:49,503 --> 00:13:52,905
She could have reacted to some
stress in her environment,

294
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,140
and your guy might not
have known how to calm her.

295
00:13:55,176 --> 00:13:56,542
Were there any other signs of a struggle?

296
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:59,078
No. No blood. Nothing was broken.

297
00:13:59,113 --> 00:14:00,379
The bed was made.

298
00:14:00,414 --> 00:14:01,580
Cleanest house I've ever seen,

299
00:14:01,615 --> 00:14:03,282
almost like no one lived here.

300
00:14:03,317 --> 00:14:05,951
Or like he tried to straighten
up really good after.

301
00:14:05,986 --> 00:14:08,987
No forced entry. Not
even one window unlocked.

302
00:14:09,023 --> 00:14:11,490
If somebody dropped her body
there like Mr. George says,

303
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:13,592
- how'd they get in?
- Then like I said,

304
00:14:13,627 --> 00:14:15,461
maybe she was wandering his way at night.

305
00:14:15,496 --> 00:14:18,430
And this morning is the first
her family knew about it.

306
00:14:18,466 --> 00:14:20,499
It could be.

307
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:22,134
Listening to you interview the parents

308
00:14:22,169 --> 00:14:24,002
might give me a better
idea of how Annie lived.

309
00:14:24,038 --> 00:14:25,604
Thank you for volunteering that, Joe.

310
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,973
- Glad to do it.
- Amy and Julio,

311
00:14:28,008 --> 00:14:29,942
try to get as much information as possible

312
00:14:29,977 --> 00:14:33,946
from Mr. and Mrs. O'Hara before
you tell them the bad news.

313
00:14:33,981 --> 00:14:35,414
Yeah. Okay.

314
00:14:35,449 --> 00:14:37,516
Thank you.

315
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,620
When was the last time you saw Annie?

316
00:14:41,655 --> 00:14:44,656
Uh, it was 8:00, 8:30,
somewhere around there. Yeah.

317
00:14:44,692 --> 00:14:47,493
Bedtimes are the one
thing that's been easier lately.

318
00:14:47,528 --> 00:14:49,294
Actually, you know, I did pop my head in.

319
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,464
It was around, uh, 10:00.
She was already asleep.

320
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,366
I mean, I should have locked her in.

321
00:14:54,401 --> 00:14:57,069
I just... she was... She
was so sound asleep.

322
00:14:57,104 --> 00:14:58,604
Sometimes when she gets up in the morning,

323
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,539
if her door isn't open, she panics.

324
00:15:00,574 --> 00:15:04,276
Were there any activities
or social circumstances

325
00:15:04,311 --> 00:15:07,546
where Annie was out of your
supervision during the day?

326
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:09,047
No.

327
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:12,017
No, no, it's a 24/7 situation.

328
00:15:12,052 --> 00:15:14,319
We're big believers in constant interaction.

329
00:15:14,355 --> 00:15:16,922
There's a lot of evidence
to support that approach.

330
00:15:16,957 --> 00:15:18,991
Sounds like they were
doing the right things.

331
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:20,359
Ray always said I couldn't do it.

332
00:15:20,394 --> 00:15:22,094
It was too much to handle.

333
00:15:22,129 --> 00:15:23,662
- Yeah.
- Honey, don't get upset about Ray again.

334
00:15:23,697 --> 00:15:25,230
Ray, ma'am? Who's Ray?

335
00:15:25,266 --> 00:15:28,233
Jen's first husband, Ray Sutton.

336
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,270
He was not an ideal parent, period.

337
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,005
Let's run Ray Sutton and see what turns up.

338
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:34,573
Because when Bill gets an attorney,

339
00:15:34,608 --> 00:15:37,142
he will check on Mr. Sutton if we don't.

340
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:39,044
But to his credit, he knew it.

341
00:15:39,079 --> 00:15:40,612
He never ducked out on
child support, even though

342
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,014
I told him it wasn't necessary.

343
00:15:42,049 --> 00:15:43,348
Screw his money.

344
00:15:43,384 --> 00:15:45,617
Ray wanted perfect kids.

345
00:15:45,653 --> 00:15:48,020
Perfect kids are hard to come by.

346
00:15:48,055 --> 00:15:49,988
Well, has she run off before?

347
00:15:50,024 --> 00:15:52,057
You know, maybe it's
because she's a teenager,

348
00:15:52,092 --> 00:15:53,392
but...  yeah.

349
00:15:53,427 --> 00:15:55,527
I mean, lately if you leave the door open

350
00:15:55,563 --> 00:15:57,596
- or you turn your back for a second, she's...
- We did.

351
00:15:57,631 --> 00:15:59,464
We put more locks on the door.

352
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,600
- She run off at night, too?
- Um...

353
00:16:01,635 --> 00:16:04,102
Yeah, it's a fairly new problem, yeah.

354
00:16:04,138 --> 00:16:07,439
Um, last week I was on the phone, and...

355
00:16:07,474 --> 00:16:10,342
The sliding glass door to the patio, um,

356
00:16:10,377 --> 00:16:13,212
was open behind me, and...

357
00:16:13,247 --> 00:16:15,647
I mean, she was five blocks
away before I found her.

358
00:16:15,683 --> 00:16:18,417
She was, uh...
She was at the park.

359
00:16:18,452 --> 00:16:20,519
She loves the swings.

360
00:16:20,554 --> 00:16:23,121
I mean, she'd swing all day if she could.

361
00:16:23,157 --> 00:16:26,191
It's okay.

362
00:16:26,227 --> 00:16:30,362
Does Annie know how to read and write?

363
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:34,533
At about a second grade level, yeah. Why?

364
00:16:35,736 --> 00:16:37,469
Could she have made these?

365
00:16:42,243 --> 00:16:44,710
Um...

366
00:16:44,745 --> 00:16:46,144
Where... where are these from?

367
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:50,649
Front of Mr. George's refrigerator.

368
00:16:54,755 --> 00:16:57,356
Uh... Yeah, A-Annie, um...

369
00:16:57,391 --> 00:16:59,458
- She... she can't make this.
- Are you telling me my daughter did what?

370
00:16:59,493 --> 00:17:01,159
- She made valentines for that bastard?
- Look, she's not...

371
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:04,062
She's not in a relationship with anybody.

372
00:17:04,098 --> 00:17:05,364
She doesn't know him.

373
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,399
- Yes?
- Okay? She doesn't know him.

374
00:17:07,434 --> 00:17:09,434
- Okay.
- Where is she?

375
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,471
Dr. Morales is ready for you, captain.

376
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:15,374
- Where's my daughter?
- Did he rape her? Did he...

377
00:17:15,409 --> 00:17:18,543
Let's call and arrange for
an attorney for Mr. George.

378
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,714
Where... where did he take
my little girl? Is she...

379
00:17:25,052 --> 00:17:27,185
We found your daughter.

380
00:17:27,221 --> 00:17:31,189
We know where she is, ma'am, yes.

381
00:17:31,225 --> 00:17:33,058
My apologies on the delay.

382
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:36,128
We're backed up with the
post-Christmas blues.

383
00:17:36,163 --> 00:17:37,663
Yeah, well, I took one jumper

384
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:39,131
off your table this morning.

385
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:40,632
Every little bit helps.

386
00:17:40,668 --> 00:17:42,801
So, your teenage girl.

387
00:17:42,836 --> 00:17:45,203
- Annie.
- Hmm?

388
00:17:45,239 --> 00:17:46,705
Her name is Annie.

389
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:49,141
Annie. Right.

390
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:52,344
Uh, cause of death is
positional asphyxiation.

391
00:17:52,379 --> 00:17:54,546
Meaning someone applied too
much pressure to her torso.

392
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:56,548
Actually, kept the lungs from being able

393
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,517
to expand and contract.

394
00:17:58,552 --> 00:18:00,352
By sitting on her, lying on her, what?

395
00:18:00,387 --> 00:18:01,787
Possibly. However it happened,

396
00:18:01,822 --> 00:18:03,288
she wasn't able to breathe,

397
00:18:03,324 --> 00:18:04,790
and if that goes on long enough, you die.

398
00:18:04,825 --> 00:18:07,759
Could this have occurred
during a sexual assault?

399
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:09,461
Your victim was a virgin.

400
00:18:09,496 --> 00:18:11,396
But she could have died before the suspect

401
00:18:11,432 --> 00:18:12,798
had a chance to do anything.

402
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:14,733
She starts screaming,
he tries to shut her up.

403
00:18:14,768 --> 00:18:16,702
It's a terrible story

404
00:18:16,737 --> 00:18:18,337
I keep hoping to not have to repeat.

405
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:21,373
This rules out a longer sexual relationship.

406
00:18:21,408 --> 00:18:25,077
- Unless he was grooming her for it.
- Hmm.

407
00:18:25,112 --> 00:18:27,612
I mean, he's no idiot, Bill.
And he's hiding stuff.

408
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:30,115
Feels like maybe worse stuff.

409
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,717
Anything else, doc?

410
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:34,319
Hmm? Oh. Yeah.

411
00:18:34,355 --> 00:18:35,821
I found multi-colored fibers in her mouth

412
00:18:35,856 --> 00:18:37,556
from some kind of rainbow fabric.

413
00:18:37,591 --> 00:18:39,858
I could send them to the lab
to determine what they are.

414
00:18:39,893 --> 00:18:41,293
Have a look.

415
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:47,766
Did you see anything
like this at Bill's house?

416
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,804
No. Like Buzz said,

417
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
- the guy's place was pristine.
- Hmm.

418
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:58,276
I think we need to locate where
he uses that parking pass.

419
00:18:58,312 --> 00:19:02,347
Maybe we'll find a blanket or pillow there.

420
00:19:02,383 --> 00:19:05,484
Or maybe we'll find another girl

421
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:08,854
who makes him hearts with hugs and kisses.

422
00:19:21,063 --> 00:19:23,130
homework before the semester starts?

423
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:26,100
Oh, uh, no. This is my impact statement.

424
00:19:26,135 --> 00:19:28,269
I want to be sure to say, like,

425
00:19:28,304 --> 00:19:30,004
I'm still willing to testify,

426
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:32,740
because I want Stroh gone
one way or the other.

427
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:34,308
But I want the judge to know

428
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:37,912
that I'm not the same kid
who was in the park anymore.

429
00:19:37,947 --> 00:19:40,881
And not having to talk
about that would be...

430
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,383
great.

431
00:19:42,418 --> 00:19:44,285
It would be, yes.

432
00:19:45,354 --> 00:19:47,121
What?

433
00:19:47,156 --> 00:19:48,455
Two things.

434
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:52,393
You were never the person in the park.

435
00:19:52,428 --> 00:19:55,129
You were there because of circumstances,

436
00:19:55,164 --> 00:19:57,264
not because of who you are.

437
00:19:57,300 --> 00:20:00,100
Yeah. I think that's mostly true.

438
00:20:00,136 --> 00:20:01,836
It is entirely true.

439
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:05,339
Well, it doesn't feel entirely true.

440
00:20:05,374 --> 00:20:09,210
Rusty, you were beneath the age of consent,

441
00:20:09,245 --> 00:20:12,413
and that makes what
happened to you criminal.

442
00:20:12,448 --> 00:20:15,716
You got to remember that.
And the other thing is that

443
00:20:15,751 --> 00:20:17,218
Emma jumped the gun here, and I wish that

444
00:20:17,253 --> 00:20:19,253
she hadn't told you that she
was gonna try and make a deal

445
00:20:19,288 --> 00:20:21,055
- with Stroh, because...
- She's not?

446
00:20:21,090 --> 00:20:23,057
Well, I don't know. It's possible.

447
00:20:23,092 --> 00:20:27,428
All right, the thing is, um, Stroh...

448
00:20:27,463 --> 00:20:31,966
As a lawyer who used to
represent sex offenders,

449
00:20:32,001 --> 00:20:35,035
Stroh may have protected several criminals

450
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:37,271
that he will trade for leniency.

451
00:20:37,306 --> 00:20:38,973
He would do that?

452
00:20:39,008 --> 00:20:40,174
Highly organized killers like Stroh,

453
00:20:40,209 --> 00:20:41,909
they often plan way ahead.

454
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:45,479
Why does he still have privilege? Stroh?

455
00:20:45,514 --> 00:20:47,815
Certain communications, like
between you and Dr. Joe,

456
00:20:47,850 --> 00:20:49,350
for example, or a lawyer and a client,

457
00:20:49,385 --> 00:20:52,920
can't be given to the police or a D.A.

458
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:55,923
Unless they involve future crimes.

459
00:20:55,958 --> 00:20:57,524
So the special master is...

460
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,393
The special master decides

461
00:20:59,428 --> 00:21:03,297
what Stroh can reveal, if
anything, from his past.

462
00:21:05,001 --> 00:21:07,368
Come by work this afternoon.
Andrea's gonna be there.

463
00:21:07,403 --> 00:21:09,370
She will explain everything.

464
00:21:14,944 --> 00:21:17,778
Oh! I... I take it there's news.

465
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:19,947
We've had a hit on our suspect's truck, sir.

466
00:21:19,982 --> 00:21:21,949
Two months ago Bill had an accident

467
00:21:21,984 --> 00:21:23,884
outside the gates of Fairfax Heights.

468
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,154
Oh. Probably the largest
apartment complex in America.

469
00:21:27,189 --> 00:21:29,323
Uh, that's the one. Security e-mailed a copy

470
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:31,091
of the parking passes they use.

471
00:21:31,127 --> 00:21:33,360
It's a match to the one we
found in the suspect's truck.

472
00:21:33,396 --> 00:21:35,963
So this goes to Bill's crash pad?

473
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:37,331
No. It's a visitor pass,

474
00:21:37,366 --> 00:21:39,166
and there's no apartment in his name. But...

475
00:21:39,201 --> 00:21:41,201
I talked them into signing consent forms

476
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:43,103
for their security footage
from two nights ago.

477
00:21:43,139 --> 00:21:45,839
Okay, we have him, sir. We have him.

478
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,475
Bill enters Tower 14 at 8:11 P.M.

479
00:21:48,511 --> 00:21:51,211
He goes up to the third floor.

480
00:21:51,247 --> 00:21:54,915
And wait until you see who
he was going to visit, sir.

481
00:22:01,958 --> 00:22:03,190
Meet Kayla,

482
00:22:03,225 --> 00:22:06,527
daughter of Bill's current girlfriend.

483
00:22:06,562 --> 00:22:09,096
Where is her mother?

484
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:10,464
She's on her way here.

485
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:13,167
All right, get the captain. And Dr. Joe.

486
00:22:13,202 --> 00:22:16,203
It's his job to ask her
the disgusting questions.

487
00:22:16,238 --> 00:22:17,938
And I'm thinking, Flynn,

488
00:22:17,974 --> 00:22:20,941
that they're going to want
those paper hearts, too.

489
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:22,209
Yeah.

490
00:22:26,582 --> 00:22:29,850
My daughter makes these all the time.

491
00:22:29,885 --> 00:22:31,518
She just loves Bill.

492
00:22:31,554 --> 00:22:34,088
Well, he treats her like a princess.

493
00:22:35,558 --> 00:22:37,424
The night before last, Bill
was at your apartment?

494
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,928
Yeah, like he is most nights.
He goes to work around 11:30.

495
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:43,464
Wh-why are you asking
about Bill? Is he okay?

496
00:22:43,499 --> 00:22:46,400
I-I called, but I haven't
heard from him since he left.

497
00:22:46,435 --> 00:22:48,502
How do you know Bill?

498
00:22:48,537 --> 00:22:51,405
We met at his day job.

499
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,141
He works at the car wash near my office.

500
00:22:54,176 --> 00:22:56,176
And we just hit it off.

501
00:22:56,212 --> 00:22:57,644
Even after he knew I was a single mom,

502
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,980
which is usually when guys suddenly remember

503
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:02,149
they have something else to do.

504
00:23:02,184 --> 00:23:05,519
Bill was never bothered by Kayla at all.

505
00:23:05,554 --> 00:23:08,889
Uh-huh. And how is their
relationship... Kayla and Bill?

506
00:23:08,924 --> 00:23:11,892
Fine. Great. Why are you asking that?

507
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,034
Ms. Kemp, are you aware Mr. George

508
00:23:20,069 --> 00:23:22,102
is a registered sex offender

509
00:23:22,138 --> 00:23:25,005
and served two years for
unlawful sex with a minor?

510
00:23:29,111 --> 00:23:31,612
What, are you kidding me?

511
00:23:31,647 --> 00:23:34,648
And you're asking me about Kayla?

512
00:23:34,683 --> 00:23:36,917
You think he did something to her?

513
00:23:36,952 --> 00:23:39,586
Ms. Kemp, we're only
covering our bases here.

514
00:23:39,622 --> 00:23:41,922
With your consent, we'd like
to search your apartment

515
00:23:41,957 --> 00:23:43,957
just to make sure everything is okay,

516
00:23:43,993 --> 00:23:45,993
and have Kayla talk to a specialist

517
00:23:46,028 --> 00:23:48,595
- to assess the situation.
- Oh, my God.

518
00:23:48,631 --> 00:23:50,330
Did he...

519
00:23:50,366 --> 00:23:53,100
Let's not jump the gun. No. First...

520
00:23:53,135 --> 00:23:55,402
First... first, let's talk to Kayla.

521
00:23:55,438 --> 00:23:57,604
Let's hear what she has to say.

522
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:00,174
- All right?
- Oh, my God.

523
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:03,077
Okay.

524
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:04,978
I'm sorry.

525
00:24:06,215 --> 00:24:08,982
Bill's awesome.

526
00:24:09,018 --> 00:24:11,452
He leaves early, so I
hide them in his truck.

527
00:24:11,487 --> 00:24:12,953
The hearts.

528
00:24:12,988 --> 00:24:14,354
Mom says a kind word from a friend

529
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,190
can get you through a rough day.

530
00:24:16,225 --> 00:24:17,491
And Bill's a friend?

531
00:24:17,526 --> 00:24:19,927
Oh, yeah. He's the best.

532
00:24:19,962 --> 00:24:23,464
He takes me to Dodgers games, the movies.

533
00:24:23,499 --> 00:24:25,332
And sometimes we just kick back.

534
00:24:25,367 --> 00:24:26,967
Is your mom with you
when you're kicking back?

535
00:24:27,002 --> 00:24:28,602
It depends on work schedules.

536
00:24:28,637 --> 00:24:31,305
Kayla, can I ask you, um...

537
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:33,373
While you're kicking back
with him on your own,

538
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,943
has Bill ever asked you to
keep a secret from your mom?

539
00:24:35,978 --> 00:24:38,579
If it's called a secret, I can't tell you.

540
00:24:38,614 --> 00:24:41,381
Well... but...

541
00:24:41,417 --> 00:24:43,584
It's my job to hold on to secrets

542
00:24:43,619 --> 00:24:45,652
and not tell anyone.

543
00:24:49,758 --> 00:24:51,391
Mom can't know.

544
00:24:51,427 --> 00:24:54,728
- Promise not to tell.
- I do.

545
00:24:54,763 --> 00:24:56,997
I almost don't want to know the answer.

546
00:24:57,032 --> 00:24:58,999
Oh, my gosh, I can't believe
I'm going to say this out loud.

547
00:24:59,034 --> 00:25:00,501
Okay.

548
00:25:00,536 --> 00:25:03,437
Bill wants to ask mom to marry him.

549
00:25:04,673 --> 00:25:07,941
And he wanted to make sure
I was cool with it first.

550
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:10,410
How about that, huh?

551
00:25:10,446 --> 00:25:12,112
Would you like that?

552
00:25:12,148 --> 00:25:13,380
If your mom and Bill got married?

553
00:25:13,415 --> 00:25:14,748
Oh, yeah.

554
00:25:14,783 --> 00:25:16,450
My mom deserves a decent guy.

555
00:25:16,485 --> 00:25:19,653
And I wouldn't let anyone
take Bill away from her.

556
00:25:19,688 --> 00:25:21,688
No one gets Bill but us.

557
00:25:21,724 --> 00:25:24,124
She seems unaffected.

558
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,093
- Uh-huh.
- After everything she's been through...

559
00:25:26,128 --> 00:25:28,395
- So why didn't Bill mention her?
- My mom needs this.

560
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,297
Or her mother?

561
00:25:30,332 --> 00:25:32,432
Because he had plans, that's why.

562
00:25:32,468 --> 00:25:36,069
They obviously didn't know
anything about his past.

563
00:25:36,105 --> 00:25:38,272
Has the suspect's public
defender come in yet?

564
00:25:38,307 --> 00:25:40,040
She's in there with him now.

565
00:25:40,075 --> 00:25:42,442
Let's inform her that Bill
has nothing left to hide.

566
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:45,179
He'll either make a deal, or he won't.

567
00:25:52,788 --> 00:25:54,354
Tori Kemp wants to know

568
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,822
why you haven't been returning her calls.

569
00:25:55,858 --> 00:25:57,491
I'm sorry. Just catching up here.

570
00:25:57,526 --> 00:26:00,027
Who is Tori Kemp? Your client, Jane,

571
00:26:00,062 --> 00:26:03,263
has a secret girlfriend
with a 13-year-old daughter.

572
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:05,499
I've been chatting with Kayla, too,

573
00:26:05,534 --> 00:26:07,734
and here's what bothers
me about all this, Bill.

574
00:26:07,770 --> 00:26:11,004
You never told me about
Ms. Kemp and her daughter,

575
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,207
and you never told them
about your life in prison.

576
00:26:13,242 --> 00:26:14,541
You've been keeping a lot of secrets

577
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:16,410
from a lot of different people.

578
00:26:16,445 --> 00:26:18,579
Tori and Kayla...

579
00:26:18,614 --> 00:26:23,083
They were why I was on that bridge, Andy.

580
00:26:23,118 --> 00:26:24,751
What, you... you dragged them into this?

581
00:26:24,787 --> 00:26:26,787
You said you wanted to help me.

582
00:26:26,822 --> 00:26:29,189
How... how is that helping anything?

583
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:32,059
You know, Bill, Andy here likes you.

584
00:26:32,094 --> 00:26:35,229
Me? Well... I'm a little more suspicious.

585
00:26:35,264 --> 00:26:37,297
And in my travels through depraved parts

586
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:39,066
of the criminal world,

587
00:26:39,101 --> 00:26:41,735
I've heard the theory
floated that sexual predators

588
00:26:41,770 --> 00:26:44,805
try to get close with single moms,

589
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:48,208
and to get even closer to their kids.

590
00:26:48,244 --> 00:26:51,445
Why did you tell them about me?

591
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:54,581
Why did you tell them? Why?

592
00:26:54,617 --> 00:26:56,650
Did you think that was necessary?

593
00:26:56,685 --> 00:26:59,519
You lied to me. The whole time, you lied.

594
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:01,321
Look, Bill, they're just
trying to push your buttons.

595
00:27:01,357 --> 00:27:03,357
- You lied. You lied.
- If they had any evidence

596
00:27:03,392 --> 00:27:05,726
you'd done anything with Kayla,
you'd already be under arrest.

597
00:27:05,761 --> 00:27:07,394
My client was under the impression

598
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:09,062
you were trying to verify his story.

599
00:27:09,098 --> 00:27:10,664
Well, that didn't work out, Jane,

600
00:27:10,699 --> 00:27:12,332
so we're going to do this instead.

601
00:27:12,368 --> 00:27:15,402
If your client would like
to tell us the details

602
00:27:15,437 --> 00:27:16,670
of how he murdered Annie

603
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:19,072
and attempted to dispose of her body,

604
00:27:19,108 --> 00:27:21,441
then we'll bring a D.A. in here

605
00:27:21,477 --> 00:27:23,477
with a deal for life in prison.

606
00:27:23,512 --> 00:27:26,680
Or he can drag the people
he pretends to love

607
00:27:26,715 --> 00:27:30,250
through an expensive and pointless trial.

608
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:33,387
Mr. George, I advise you to take your time.

609
00:27:33,422 --> 00:27:35,455
- Why? Why?
- 'Cause these...

610
00:27:35,491 --> 00:27:39,259
Why, why? Everybody
knows, so why wait, okay?

611
00:27:40,629 --> 00:27:42,262
You have a pen, Andy?

612
00:27:42,298 --> 00:27:44,431
Not before a D.A. gets here with an offer!

613
00:27:44,466 --> 00:27:46,900
- Mr. George, you will not take that pen.
- I revoke my right to counsel.

614
00:27:46,935 --> 00:27:49,503
Shut up!

615
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:56,443
Just start at the beginning.

616
00:28:24,173 --> 00:28:25,672
Oh, my God!

617
00:28:25,708 --> 00:28:29,676
Let go! Bill! Bill, let go!

618
00:28:32,314 --> 00:28:35,515
Why did you tell them?

619
00:28:45,748 --> 00:28:49,417
That, um, that Kayla girl...

620
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:50,885
Sh-she okay?

621
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,753
She didn't present as someone
who'd been molested,

622
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:54,689
if that's what you mean.

623
00:28:54,724 --> 00:28:57,558
And, uh, her hopes for
her mom seemed genuine.

624
00:28:57,593 --> 00:28:59,660
Well, Ms. Kemp might have loved the guy,

625
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:02,863
but she was definitely
getting a pig in a poke,

626
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:04,331
as we used to say.

627
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,333
You know, it's... it's interesting

628
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:08,602
how Bill George could turn his life around

629
00:29:08,638 --> 00:29:11,238
enough so that he could
have an adult relationship

630
00:29:11,274 --> 00:29:12,807
- to begin with.
- Uh, I don't know.

631
00:29:12,842 --> 00:29:15,342
He's older. People's attractions change

632
00:29:15,378 --> 00:29:16,811
with negative reinforcement.

633
00:29:16,846 --> 00:29:18,412
Though that's hard to do.

634
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:20,548
Tell me about it.

635
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:21,782
I myself...

636
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,386
Ah, well...  I myself

637
00:29:25,421 --> 00:29:26,921
find I'm seeing...

638
00:29:26,956 --> 00:29:29,323
and, uh...

639
00:29:29,358 --> 00:29:31,625
I'm definitely having second
thoughts about it all...

640
00:29:31,661 --> 00:29:35,830
Seeing someone who is so very much different

641
00:29:35,865 --> 00:29:38,733
from anyone I've ever
dated in my adult life.

642
00:29:38,768 --> 00:29:40,668
Oh. How different?

643
00:29:40,703 --> 00:29:42,870
Huge?

644
00:29:42,905 --> 00:29:44,405
In, uh, what way?

645
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:49,877
Well, um, she's...

646
00:29:49,912 --> 00:29:53,314
It's... she's very close to my own age.

647
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,818
I mean, I don't go out with women over 40.

648
00:30:01,824 --> 00:30:05,559
Well...

649
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:08,362
- Why don't you just drop her?
- What?

650
00:30:08,397 --> 00:30:10,998
Stop seeing her if she's not what you want.

651
00:30:11,033 --> 00:30:12,533
Well...

652
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:14,835
Who said she's not what I want?

653
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:16,070
Oh, I thought you did.

654
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:18,339
I most certainly did not.

655
00:30:18,374 --> 00:30:20,407
And here's something else I'll tell you.

656
00:30:20,443 --> 00:30:22,710
In a relationship, doctor,

657
00:30:22,745 --> 00:30:25,412
it's not always about what you want.

658
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:28,382
Sometimes it's about what
the other person wants.

659
00:30:28,417 --> 00:30:30,918
Well, if you say so, lieutenant.

660
00:30:30,953 --> 00:30:32,787
Excuse me. Would you see this report

661
00:30:32,822 --> 00:30:34,054
gets filed with your captain?

662
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,490
Thank you.

663
00:30:36,526 --> 00:30:38,359
Psychologists.

664
00:30:38,394 --> 00:30:41,061
What took you so long?
Did you serve the warrants?

665
00:30:41,097 --> 00:30:42,830
Well, what'd you find?

666
00:30:42,865 --> 00:30:44,532
The clasp from the broken bracelet.

667
00:30:44,567 --> 00:30:47,067
And the blanket that Annie's
face was pressed into

668
00:30:47,103 --> 00:30:48,903
while someone sat on her ribs.

669
00:30:48,938 --> 00:30:51,005
And you found this in Tori Kemp's apartment?

670
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,040
- No.
- Worse than that.

671
00:30:54,510 --> 00:30:56,744
What could be worse than that?

672
00:30:56,779 --> 00:30:58,045
In Annie's bedroom.

673
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,080
Annie was killed in her own house.

674
00:31:00,116 --> 00:31:02,016
Her bracelet broke in the struggle.

675
00:31:02,051 --> 00:31:04,518
Any sign of forced entry?

676
00:31:04,554 --> 00:31:05,886
None.

677
00:31:05,922 --> 00:31:07,755
But the fibers in the blanket

678
00:31:07,790 --> 00:31:10,424
are a definitive match to the
ones found in Annie's mouth.

679
00:31:10,459 --> 00:31:12,560
She's lying face down, prone,

680
00:31:12,595 --> 00:31:14,695
gasping for air on her own bed.

681
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:16,063
What do we have on Annie's parents?

682
00:31:16,098 --> 00:31:18,132
I looked on their browser history.

683
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:21,535
There's a ton of visits to
the Megan's Law Database.

684
00:31:21,571 --> 00:31:23,070
And over a dozen times last month,

685
00:31:23,105 --> 00:31:25,472
someone searched Bill George's page.

686
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,642
And that background check we
did on Annie's natural father,

687
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:30,678
- Ray Sutton?
- No priors,

688
00:31:30,713 --> 00:31:32,446
no arrests, and he lives in Colorado.

689
00:31:32,481 --> 00:31:34,448
And he says he doesn't
have keys to the house.

690
00:31:34,483 --> 00:31:36,717
Well, someone does, though,
if Annie died in her own room.

691
00:31:36,752 --> 00:31:39,420
Or someone has keys to Bill George's house,

692
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:41,655
because neither showed
signs of forced entry.

693
00:31:43,125 --> 00:31:44,959
You said Bill's house was pristine.

694
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:49,730
Bill said his windows have
been broken... several times.

695
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:51,866
So he had to have them fixed several times.

696
00:31:51,901 --> 00:31:53,934
Wait, whoa, whoa.
If you're suggesting

697
00:31:53,970 --> 00:31:56,237
that we talk to this nut job again,

698
00:31:56,272 --> 00:31:58,606
I'm chaining him to the floor.

699
00:31:58,641 --> 00:32:01,475
Bill, your doors had dead bolts on them.

700
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:04,545
Nobody popped them.
Your windows, all locked.

701
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:07,715
No one had access to your house except you.

702
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,783
So who else could have entered?

703
00:32:09,819 --> 00:32:12,119
He doesn't know. Why don't
you ask one of the neighbors?

704
00:32:12,154 --> 00:32:14,088
Apparently they watch his
house like guard dogs.

705
00:32:14,123 --> 00:32:16,957
How are you so sure one of
them didn't kill the girl

706
00:32:16,993 --> 00:32:18,525
- just to frame my client?
- Why?

707
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,127
Now it's the neighbors setting him up?

708
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:21,762
That's a new legal theory.

709
00:32:21,797 --> 00:32:23,631
Because, "hi, I'm your new neighbor,

710
00:32:23,666 --> 00:32:26,100
and I'm a registered sex
offender, nice to meet you."

711
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:29,470
Bill, you said your windows were broken.

712
00:32:29,505 --> 00:32:31,171
Several times, yes.

713
00:32:31,207 --> 00:32:34,541
I would walk in to find a
rock lying on the floor...

714
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:37,478
- Bill.
- And shards of glass everywhere.

715
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:39,046
Did you pay someone to fix your windows,

716
00:32:39,081 --> 00:32:40,848
or did you do it yourself?

717
00:32:40,883 --> 00:32:44,051
Of course I didn't fix them.
I called a repair guy.

718
00:32:44,086 --> 00:32:45,619
Do you have his contact info?

719
00:32:45,655 --> 00:32:47,788
There's a receipt in my kitchen.

720
00:32:47,823 --> 00:32:51,158
I save everything. A guy
in prison told me that.

721
00:32:51,193 --> 00:32:55,963
Keep records, receipts,
check stubs, tickets,

722
00:32:55,998 --> 00:32:57,765
whatever, just in case.

723
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,467
I even saved the rocks.

724
00:33:00,503 --> 00:33:02,970
You... you want them, too?

725
00:33:03,005 --> 00:33:06,473
Bill, you work two jobs.

726
00:33:06,509 --> 00:33:09,643
One of them's all day long.
How did this repairman

727
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,545
get in to fix your window?

728
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:13,080
With a spare key

729
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,649
that I leave out over the front door.

730
00:33:15,685 --> 00:33:17,851
You think somebody set him
up to get into his house?

731
00:33:17,887 --> 00:33:19,586
Ask him. He'll tell you.

732
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:22,222
Annie's parents were at Bill's
even before we got there.

733
00:33:22,258 --> 00:33:24,992
Following a G.P.S. signal on a bracelet.

734
00:33:25,027 --> 00:33:26,694
Which led them directly to someone

735
00:33:26,729 --> 00:33:28,929
they'd looked up online a hundred times.

736
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,864
Sir.

737
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,866
Maybe we should brief Mr. and Mrs. O'Hara

738
00:33:32,902 --> 00:33:34,101
on our progress.

739
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:36,770
Ah.

740
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:38,772
And let's get Hobbs in here.

741
00:33:40,710 --> 00:33:42,142
I think we're ready.

742
00:33:42,178 --> 00:33:44,545
You said that you have new information.

743
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,647
Um, yes, we now believe

744
00:33:46,682 --> 00:33:50,551
that Annie was killed in her bedroom.

745
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:52,953
What? I'm sorry, what...

746
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:55,155
- What... are you saying this man...
- No. No, no, that doesn't...

747
00:33:55,191 --> 00:33:57,291
- That doesn't make any sense.
- Broke into our house and hurt our little girl

748
00:33:57,326 --> 00:33:59,626
- while we slept in the next room?
- Her bracelet was found in his house.

749
00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:01,595
We have an eyewitness, a neighbor who saw

750
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:04,798
someone carry a body into
Bill's place that night...

751
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,168
Using this spare key.

752
00:34:08,204 --> 00:34:11,138
It was left on the ledge
above the front door.

753
00:34:11,173 --> 00:34:14,108
A very smart person could have watched

754
00:34:14,143 --> 00:34:17,211
how the window repairman
entered Mr. George's house

755
00:34:17,246 --> 00:34:18,879
while he was away.

756
00:34:18,914 --> 00:34:20,914
Taking this key from above the front door.

757
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:23,050
And that's what our
witness says he saw happen.

758
00:34:23,085 --> 00:34:28,188
He also says that he can
identify the person who did it.

759
00:34:28,224 --> 00:34:30,557
I wish we actually had an eyewitness.

760
00:34:30,593 --> 00:34:33,160
We do. If they think we do.

761
00:34:33,195 --> 00:34:35,662
Who... who did this witness see?

762
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:38,032
Well, the physical description sounds

763
00:34:38,067 --> 00:34:40,868
very much like your husband.

764
00:34:40,903 --> 00:34:44,038
- What, like Chris?
- Mm-hmm.

765
00:34:44,073 --> 00:34:47,174
Okay, are you joking?
We... Chris was with me.

766
00:34:47,209 --> 00:34:49,676
Well, it's probably just a coincidence,

767
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:51,945
but because the description is so close,

768
00:34:51,981 --> 00:34:53,280
we'd like to ask you, Mr. O'Hara,

769
00:34:53,315 --> 00:34:55,182
to participate in a line-up.

770
00:35:00,156 --> 00:35:03,323
Moment of truth, buddy.

771
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:05,125
If he walks out, we're screwed.

772
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:08,595
Right now?

773
00:35:08,631 --> 00:35:09,930
If it's no trouble.

774
00:35:09,965 --> 00:35:13,067
Yeah. Everyone is waiting.

775
00:35:17,840 --> 00:35:19,039
W...

776
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,841
What's the big deal? Just go.

777
00:35:27,216 --> 00:35:28,415
Chris.

778
00:35:32,321 --> 00:35:35,189
Chris, why aren't you going?

779
00:35:39,228 --> 00:35:41,795
Oh, my God, what did you do?

780
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:43,864
Oh! What did you do?

781
00:35:43,899 --> 00:35:46,233
Look at me!

782
00:35:46,268 --> 00:35:49,903
Oh, my... what... what did you do?!

783
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:52,439
What did you do to Annie? Oh, my...

784
00:35:52,475 --> 00:35:54,875
What did you do? Damn it!

785
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,611
What did you do?! What did you do?!

786
00:35:57,646 --> 00:36:00,647
Chris! She loved you!

787
00:36:00,683 --> 00:36:03,750
Oh, my God! Chris!

788
00:36:06,188 --> 00:36:09,623
You have the
right to remain silent.

789
00:36:09,658 --> 00:36:11,358
Anything you say can and will be

790
00:36:11,393 --> 00:36:12,893
used against you in a court of law.

791
00:36:12,928 --> 00:36:14,661
You have the right to an attorney.

792
00:36:14,697 --> 00:36:16,663
If you cannot afford one, one
will be appointed for you.

793
00:36:16,699 --> 00:36:18,832
Do not get up without asking me!

794
00:36:18,868 --> 00:36:22,870
- Julio.
- I'm just setting the ground rules, ma'am.

795
00:36:22,905 --> 00:36:25,072
I'm not some helpless little girl, okay?

796
00:36:32,381 --> 00:36:36,116
Is there anything you'd
like to tell us, Mr. O'Hara?

797
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:37,751
It was an accident.

798
00:36:37,786 --> 00:36:39,953
It was an accident?

799
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:41,755
Annie was having a fit.

800
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:44,258
A really bad one. She was out of control,

801
00:36:44,293 --> 00:36:46,093
and I tried calming her down, but...

802
00:36:46,128 --> 00:36:48,395
I used the soft prone restraint
hold that they teach us,

803
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:51,198
but... but she just got
so aggressive, and...

804
00:36:51,233 --> 00:36:52,900
I-I don't know what happened.

805
00:36:52,935 --> 00:36:55,202
I mean, all of a sudden she
wasn't breathing, and...

806
00:36:55,237 --> 00:36:57,037
It was an accident.

807
00:36:57,072 --> 00:36:59,706
Then you accidentally moved her body

808
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:03,243
to your friendly neighborhood
sexual predator's house.

809
00:37:03,279 --> 00:37:06,113
- I didn't know what to do.
- But you did know what to do.

810
00:37:06,148 --> 00:37:09,082
You wanted it to look like

811
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:12,452
Mr. George committed this murder.

812
00:37:12,488 --> 00:37:13,987
I improvised that in the moment.

813
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:16,223
No, you did not improvise!

814
00:37:16,258 --> 00:37:18,392
- You tossed several rocks through Mr. George's windows!
- Believe what you want.

815
00:37:18,427 --> 00:37:20,394
- So he would have to call a repairman!
- I did not throw rocks

816
00:37:20,429 --> 00:37:22,262
- through George's window!
- And you could see how to gain entry

817
00:37:22,298 --> 00:37:24,164
into his house!

818
00:37:26,769 --> 00:37:28,735
Mr. O'Hara, did you wear gloves

819
00:37:28,771 --> 00:37:31,004
when you threw the rocks through the window?

820
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:33,340
Because Mr. George saved the rocks,

821
00:37:33,375 --> 00:37:35,242
and we're having them printed right now.

822
00:37:35,277 --> 00:37:37,878
That's true. Guy holds on to everything.

823
00:37:37,913 --> 00:37:40,013
If you don't want to tell us what happened,

824
00:37:40,049 --> 00:37:42,182
maybe you would prefer a jury

825
00:37:42,218 --> 00:37:44,484
to listen to how you crushed the ribs

826
00:37:44,520 --> 00:37:46,353
of a special needs child

827
00:37:46,388 --> 00:37:49,456
and then stuffed a blanket in her mouth.

828
00:37:49,491 --> 00:37:51,792
She was not a special needs child!

829
00:37:51,827 --> 00:37:53,393
She was a "no one else
can ever need anything

830
00:37:53,429 --> 00:37:55,862
because it's all about her" kind of child.

831
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:57,197
The only life that Annie ever had

832
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:59,433
was the life she took from us!

833
00:37:59,468 --> 00:38:01,735
And she was never gonna get better, but Jen,

834
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:03,403
no, she couldn't see that!

835
00:38:03,439 --> 00:38:06,173
"Oh, I can't... I can't leave
my little girl in a prison,"

836
00:38:06,208 --> 00:38:07,908
so now you want to throw me in prison?

837
00:38:07,943 --> 00:38:10,310
Where do you think I've been living anyway?

838
00:38:11,413 --> 00:38:13,347
Annie wasn't the one who was locked in!

839
00:38:13,382 --> 00:38:15,849
I was!

840
00:38:15,884 --> 00:38:17,417
God.

841
00:38:19,855 --> 00:38:22,456
You have no idea how tired I am.

842
00:38:25,828 --> 00:38:27,094
Oh...

843
00:38:27,129 --> 00:38:30,330
That should put you over the top.

844
00:38:30,366 --> 00:38:32,899
Yeah. Maybe Bill George can stop

845
00:38:32,935 --> 00:38:35,902
- trying to kill himself now.
- Go ahead.

846
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,904
I'll say this.

847
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,173
It takes a special person to
see to the special needs

848
00:38:40,209 --> 00:38:41,908
of a complicated kid.

849
00:38:44,146 --> 00:38:46,046
Excuse me.

850
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:53,086
- Write it all down.
- Hey.

851
00:38:53,122 --> 00:38:54,621
I'll see what we can do.

852
00:39:10,217 --> 00:39:12,785
Impact statements come from victims.

853
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,420
I'm not a victim.

854
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:18,757
Stroh tried to kill you.

855
00:39:18,793 --> 00:39:21,160
He hit you in the head with a shovel.

856
00:39:21,195 --> 00:39:22,961
He pushed you into a canyon.

857
00:39:22,997 --> 00:39:25,431
He sliced your leg open with a knife.

858
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:27,199
And that's all attempted murder.

859
00:39:28,502 --> 00:39:31,070
Right. Right.

860
00:39:31,105 --> 00:39:33,038
I see.

861
00:39:33,074 --> 00:39:35,407
And you're saying that Emma wants me

862
00:39:35,443 --> 00:39:37,209
to write about Stroh because...

863
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:39,345
She doesn't want the deal to go forward.

864
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:42,348
No matter what information
comes through the special master,

865
00:39:42,383 --> 00:39:44,950
Emma still thinks Stroh should go to trial

866
00:39:44,985 --> 00:39:46,185
for murder in the first

867
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:49,088
with special circumstances attached.

868
00:39:49,123 --> 00:39:52,291
Did she ever actually tell you otherwise?

869
00:39:55,329 --> 00:39:58,497
No. Um...

870
00:39:58,532 --> 00:40:01,266
- I feel like such an idiot.
- Uh... Mh-mnh.

871
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:04,470
Lawyers are so...

872
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:08,941
- I'm sorry, I just, like...
- No.

873
00:40:08,976 --> 00:40:12,077
Emma should have been clearer
with you about her intentions.

874
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:14,913
I'll talk to her about that.

875
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:17,249
But... deal or no deal,

876
00:40:17,284 --> 00:40:19,218
sometime in the next two weeks,

877
00:40:19,253 --> 00:40:21,553
this Phillip Stroh business
is coming to a head now.

878
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:23,288
Just so you know.

879
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:26,425
Thank you, Andrea.

880
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:31,096
Um, yeah, thank you. Thank you, Andrea.

881
00:40:31,132 --> 00:40:32,965
I do appreciate the truth.

882
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,266
I do.

883
00:40:40,474 --> 00:40:42,141
So what do you think?

884
00:40:42,176 --> 00:40:45,511
I mean, sh-should I write
the impact statement or not?

885
00:40:48,315 --> 00:40:50,582
It's a choice

886
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:54,420
between putting someone
in an institution for life,

887
00:40:54,455 --> 00:40:57,122
or putting them to death
because they are in some way

888
00:40:57,158 --> 00:41:00,058
a danger, and lack the
mental capacity for change.

889
00:41:02,062 --> 00:41:04,329
It's an awful thing to have to consider.

890
00:41:06,434 --> 00:41:08,534
But you've been given a voice here,

891
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:10,602
if not the last word.

892
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,206
If it were up to Rusty Beck,

893
00:41:14,241 --> 00:41:16,108
what would happen

894
00:41:16,143 --> 00:41:18,510
to someone like Phillip Stroh?

895
00:41:27,906 --> 00:41:31,959
