1
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:18,244
- Hand over that gun!
- You thought you held all the cards.

2
00:01:18,445 --> 00:01:21,573
You thought you'd force me
not to file for divorce.

3
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,056
Erica, the gun is mine. I want it.

4
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:35,022
Not until I've had a good explanation.

5
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:37,526
Shit! Shit!

6
00:01:48,975 --> 00:01:52,934
- What's going on?
- Drunk-driving in Atlanta, remember?

7
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:55,637
- Did he see you?
- I don't think so.

8
00:01:56,483 --> 00:01:58,474
Get up.

9
00:01:58,685 --> 00:02:00,380
- Whose is this?
- Mine.

10
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:04,387
- I don't know, 80 in a 55.
- You'll never get away with it.

11
00:02:04,591 --> 00:02:07,389
O ye of little faith!

12
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,131
- Did you fix that transmitter?
- Ready.

13
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:20,738
What's going on?

14
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:22,908
Turn me on.

15
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:28,813
- I'm just a country boy!
- I'll cover that.

16
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,779
Frequency 6, check your local listings.

17
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,479
- A cold reading, $10 ante, who's in?
- I'm with my boss.

18
00:02:36,689 --> 00:02:39,089
I say he can't do it.

19
00:02:39,292 --> 00:02:42,022
Where's your loyalty?

20
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:48,526
- Oh, child, he looks nasty!
- This is gonna be real good.

21
00:02:48,735 --> 00:02:50,032
Sh! Listen.

22
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:53,694
Is this beautiful country or what?
How fast was I going?

23
00:02:53,907 --> 00:02:56,899
- 80 in a 55.
- Whoa! Really?

24
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,907
Licence and registration.

25
00:02:59,112 --> 00:03:00,409
Yes, sir.

26
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:04,379
Let's see what we got here, Lowell.
Let's see.

27
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:08,520
A playing card. My only royal flush,
signed by Shorty Casewell.

28
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:10,552
Let's see. We got...

29
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:13,317
Licence and registration, sir.

30
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:21,962
Relax, where's the fire?

31
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:26,605
I'm gonna ask you one more time.
Do you have the documents?

32
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:30,708
Course I do. I'm a law-abiding citizen,
just like yourself.

33
00:03:31,945 --> 00:03:36,905
The difference is there's more to life
than my nine to five.

34
00:03:38,818 --> 00:03:43,255
If you knew that, you'd still have
a wife and daughter to go home to.

35
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:47,085
Sir, put your hands on the bus,
feet apart.

36
00:03:47,293 --> 00:03:49,591
Whoa! A little cranky, aren't we?

37
00:03:49,796 --> 00:03:53,664
- What's he doing?
- He's gone too far, as usual.

38
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:57,901
You could've bought me dinner first!

39
00:03:58,104 --> 00:04:01,665
We're gonna take a walk
over to the car, sir. This way.

40
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:04,069
- He's going to jail.
- He's not.

41
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,939
He stopped writing, didn't he?

42
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:13,243
Oh, man.

43
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:20,392
Enough about me, Lowell.
It's not really me you're mad at.

44
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:24,825
You're mad at yourself, 'cause you lost
the person who loved you.

45
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:28,592
- You have the right to remain silent.
- "Frequency of names..."

46
00:04:28,801 --> 00:04:32,601
- Anything you say will...
- "By decade, by religion..."

47
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:38,471
I'm not talking about your ex-wife.
You know who I'm talking about...

48
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,944
...Cathy.

49
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,116
Cathy.

50
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:45,750
Son of a bitch.

51
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,921
The guy has balls
the size of cantaloupes!

52
00:04:50,056 --> 00:04:54,857
You think I don't know how it is?
Risking your life for minimum wage.

53
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:58,030
Never enough for those pretty dresses,

54
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:01,667
that fancy summer camp
all her friends went to.

55
00:05:01,868 --> 00:05:05,099
Then some rich asshole
takes not only your wife,

56
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:07,739
but your own little girl.

57
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,601
Have you seen her?

58
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:12,505
Can't say that I have,
but I know people.

59
00:05:12,712 --> 00:05:17,740
And I know she misses the way
you protected her. Like a princess.

60
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:20,919
The way you smiled at her
the night of the prom.

61
00:05:24,357 --> 00:05:26,985
Good times teaching her the violin.

62
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:29,286
The what?

63
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,360
Violin...

64
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,161
Clair de lune.

65
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,337
We played that together.

66
00:05:38,538 --> 00:05:41,166
No rich step-daddy can give her that.

67
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,672
She hasn't called in over a year.

68
00:05:43,876 --> 00:05:49,280
You made her choose between you
and her mother. You drove her away.

69
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,281
Maybe I'll call her tonight.

70
00:05:53,486 --> 00:05:55,420
Tonight...

71
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:59,421
When I got a phone
right there on that bus?

72
00:06:06,499 --> 00:06:08,467
You wouldn't mind?

73
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,796
My brother Lowell,
what are friends for?

74
00:06:12,004 --> 00:06:14,370
Yeah!

75
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:17,133
Yeah!

76
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:23,175
I talked to her and
I'll go see her on the weekend.

77
00:06:23,383 --> 00:06:26,819
- Thank you, Brother Lowell.
- I can't thank you enough.

78
00:06:27,019 --> 00:06:28,486
Praise the Lord!

79
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:32,915
- Did she win?
- And he made a donation. Unbelievable!

80
00:06:33,126 --> 00:06:37,392
I got the Wellesley decal
and the wedding band, but the violin?

81
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:43,199
Red mark on the jaw from the chin rest.
You know me, I know people!

82
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:47,772
Yeah, well, I'll make it back
just when you least expect it.

83
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,034
I always expect it.
That's why I always win.

84
00:06:51,244 --> 00:06:56,045
If it wasn't for you, I'd be playing
doctor with some car thief.

85
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,083
- What can I say, man?
- Just say, "Thank you, Jesus!"

86
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:32,151
- You OK back there?
- Something's blown.

87
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,784
Man!

88
00:07:33,986 --> 00:07:35,681
What's happened?

89
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:38,220
Truck's blowing smoke, man.

90
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:41,723
- Next exit, let's get off.
- You got it.

91
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:08,676
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.
This is the place.

92
00:09:08,881 --> 00:09:12,647
- You know where we are?
- This is nowhere.

93
00:09:16,689 --> 00:09:18,748
Hey, what's up?

94
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:22,860
We don't get a replacement part
till Tuesday. Yeah, four days!

95
00:09:23,062 --> 00:09:25,792
- Shit! We'd clean up in Topeka.
- Yeah.

96
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:28,796
I'm exhausted. We could use a break.

97
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:31,492
You're gonna get one. We got no choice.

98
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:36,334
I always have a choice.
Set up, we'll play here.

99
00:09:37,443 --> 00:09:39,070
Here?

100
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,207
Here.

101
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:53,217
This is where the truckers come.

102
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,989
This looks nice.

103
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:01,522
I can smell trouble like shit on a griddle.

104
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,464
Take a look at what just walked in.

105
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:07,571
Dolores, you are such a bone-hound.

106
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:10,173
Everybody needs a hobby.

107
00:10:10,376 --> 00:10:12,344
Even you.

108
00:10:15,181 --> 00:10:19,618
- Sit down here, baby.
- Like I was saying, that man is nasty!

109
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,787
They believe, yeah!

110
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:31,218
- He ain't gonna bother you or me.
- I know.

111
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:38,370
Marva, huh? As in "Marvellous"?

112
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:41,870
- As in my grandmother.
- Not for a second.

113
00:10:42,074 --> 00:10:44,838
- I'm Jonas.
- Hi.

114
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,213
Something got you down suddenly?

115
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:56,320
I never knew a problem
Chuck Berry couldn't solve.

116
00:10:56,522 --> 00:10:58,786
It's broken.

117
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:03,195
Maybe I can fix it.
Life's too short to go without music.

118
00:11:03,396 --> 00:11:07,093
Why don't you try laying on hands?

119
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:13,537
I wish I could, ma'am,
'cause I know how Jesus loves to rock.

120
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:18,335
Where's your manners?
He's a preacher. Be polite.

121
00:11:20,646 --> 00:11:23,479
Hm, corn relish! I hate corn relish.

122
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,208
- First female serial killer?
- Aileen Wuornos.

123
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,751
- How many victims?
- Eight.

124
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,117
Special is steak.
No liver, no fish, no spinach.

125
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,657
- Awful lot of noes there, Marva.
- No lip.

126
00:11:35,861 --> 00:11:38,989
I'll take the diet plate, please.

127
00:11:42,635 --> 00:11:44,967
- She wants me.
- Yeah!

128
00:11:45,838 --> 00:11:48,671
You should stick
with your bible-boinkers.

129
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,865
A woman is like a slingshot.

130
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:55,104
The greater the resistance,
the further you can get with her.

131
00:11:55,314 --> 00:11:57,077
Besides, she's warming up.

132
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,808
What brought him
to the service of Our Lord?

133
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:04,513
You know, Georgette, to me
there's no greater thrill than preaching.

134
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:08,490
First moment, you wonder,
"Can I touch them?

135
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:12,425
"Will they feel what I feel?"

136
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:19,002
Sometimes they don't feel it at first,
that sense of needing the Lord.

137
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:23,835
You know how it feels to really need
something, don't you, Georgette?

138
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:27,069
- Your order?
- Two chilies. Hold the onions.

139
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,612
Sometimes a person doesn't
know what they need.

140
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:36,345
They wake up itchy,
hungry for whiskey or money or food.

141
00:12:36,555 --> 00:12:40,252
What they really need is love.

142
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:45,192
Sweet, tender caresses of the Lord.

143
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:47,729
- Amen! All right, Reverend.
- Amen.

144
00:12:47,933 --> 00:12:50,595
- May I take your order?
- Sure.

145
00:12:50,803 --> 00:12:53,397
I'll have the KKK omelette.

146
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,471
Whites only.

147
00:12:55,674 --> 00:12:57,642
Get out of here!

148
00:12:57,843 --> 00:13:01,074
I'm kidding. I'll have a decaf and toast.

149
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:07,545
And I give them that love, Georgette,
That... and salvation!

150
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:11,416
Salvation is the only thing
in this world that matters.

151
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:15,617
More comforting than a lover.
More valuable than diamonds.

152
00:13:15,828 --> 00:13:19,059
Come on, Preacher! Come on!

153
00:13:19,265 --> 00:13:21,392
See this?

154
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:26,734
It was a gift from my sainted mother
the year I graduated seminary.

155
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,839
- God bless her.
- Very nice.

156
00:13:35,281 --> 00:13:37,408
I'll get it.

157
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:47,055
See, Marva?

158
00:13:47,259 --> 00:13:50,422
Nothing has value without salvation.

159
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:56,696
- He put it in the water!
- Just like it was baptised!

160
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,695
He loves the Lord!

161
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:27,257
What's the date?

162
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,697
Someone could notice that
in a small town.

163
00:14:30,903 --> 00:14:35,203
It pisses off the law. They think
I've a year's salary on my wrist.

164
00:14:35,407 --> 00:14:37,841
The sheriff is Braverman.
He's clean.

165
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,102
Clean? Ugh!

166
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:46,479
Mr Nightengale,
arbitrary is not an issue here.

167
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:48,983
We've got a 27% unemployment rate.

168
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:53,488
- I need 20 guys for four days.
- Great! 26%!

169
00:14:55,027 --> 00:14:58,929
Look, no new permits
till the plants reopen

170
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,497
or till our farmers get some rain.

171
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:05,067
Till then, this town can't afford a revival.

172
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:08,035
- Sorry.
- Oh, no. I understand, Sheriff.

173
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:14,201
- You're just trying to do your job.
- No. He's trying to restrict trade.

174
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,778
Listen, Braverman.

175
00:15:16,982 --> 00:15:21,248
I got a room full of New York lawyers
dying to take on some badge

176
00:15:21,453 --> 00:15:23,648
interfering with religious freedom!

177
00:15:23,856 --> 00:15:29,089
I got the fee, I'll do the paperwork.
You give me the permit or I dial 2-1-2.

178
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,539
- Knock yourself out.
- I'll do it.

179
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:54,378
Don't take it personally, boss.
It's just one for the big guy upstairs.

180
00:15:56,622 --> 00:16:01,082
So, is all of this
absolutely necessary, Will?

181
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,067
Local law.
"The Attack of the Puny Brains".

182
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:12,135
I kissed up to him, I got the permit.

183
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:16,536
Besides, this one's cute for a change.
Now, concentrate.

184
00:16:16,742 --> 00:16:20,473
Population: 22-something.
Median family income: $21,000...

185
00:16:20,679 --> 00:16:23,648
Cute? He can shut us down.

186
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:28,047
I don't have to remind you
what our nut is: 3,500 a day.

187
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,524
Every town, another puny brain.

188
00:16:32,725 --> 00:16:35,660
Give a little man power,
he thinks he's powerful.

189
00:16:35,861 --> 00:16:41,060
Yeah, I've seen that happen before.
OK, main industries: Wheat and corn.

190
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:47,364
Ancillaries have had massive lay-offs.
The banks report 22% farm foreclosure.

191
00:16:47,573 --> 00:16:51,737
If they don't get rain by this weekend,
this year's crops will fail.

192
00:16:51,944 --> 00:16:55,971
So we can use that.
Stop drumming, Jonas! Stop!

193
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,580
What a shit-hole!

194
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:00,684
This was your choice, so live with it.

195
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:04,845
Average education: 10th grade.
Richest family: The Rayloves.

196
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:08,185
12 towns in the same area,
same situation...

197
00:17:08,394 --> 00:17:12,125
I gotta get you a man.
You've been on the road too long.

198
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:15,892
We're gonna hire us a new angel.
You pick him!

199
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:19,867
- Finished?
- I'm starting to get excited.

200
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:24,532
A town this deep in the crapper's
got nowhere to turn but God!

201
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:30,944
Kansas Radio.

202
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:36,144
When the going gets tough,
the tough dial S-O-S.

203
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:38,516
Speaking of things getting tough,

204
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:43,218
I've got someone here who says
he can help. Jonas Nightengale.

205
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,889
A man who knows
about the value of spirit.

206
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,933
Thank you, Jerry Joe. Thank you.

207
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:55,496
You know, as I look out your window,

208
00:17:55,707 --> 00:17:58,267
Rustwater reminds me
of my own home town.

209
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,945
Drugstore soda fountain.

210
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:05,412
Little movie theatre.
The one with the real butter.

211
00:18:06,385 --> 00:18:09,616
And it warms my heart.

212
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:14,259
So many people working so hard,
deserving so much better.

213
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:19,921
I know how it feels to see
old man Raylove driving his fancy car,

214
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:23,727
all the while thinking,
"I want me a car like that."

215
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:27,497
The problem is
you've got nothing to believe in.

216
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,698
Can't believe in the community
with its trouble,

217
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:34,845
it seems sometimes even the family.
So what do you believe in?

218
00:18:35,047 --> 00:18:39,006
The biggest power,
the biggest man with the plan...

219
00:18:40,018 --> 00:18:41,986
30 seconds.

220
00:18:46,225 --> 00:18:49,388
So I'm here to remind you
that tonight

221
00:18:49,595 --> 00:18:52,962
at the Rustwater camp-ground
you too, can be saved.

222
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:58,159
If you're already walking with Jesus,
celebrate your faith with your neighbour.

223
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,032
It's been too long since you've seen him.

224
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:06,940
If you're still driving that beat-up pickup,
eating macaroni and day-old bread,

225
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:13,085
come and celebrate the miracle of faith,
the power of healing.

226
00:19:13,285 --> 00:19:16,015
And you too, can wake up saying,

227
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,252
"Thank you, Jesus!"

228
00:19:22,594 --> 00:19:25,188
I been lonely, I been cheated

229
00:19:25,397 --> 00:19:27,922
I been misunderstood

230
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:33,161
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good

231
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:36,307
But with you I belong

232
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:38,874
'Cause you help me be strong

233
00:19:39,077 --> 00:19:41,637
There's a change in my life

234
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:45,374
Since you came along
Oh, yeah

235
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:55,822
Now I don't mind working
So hard every day...

236
00:19:57,563 --> 00:20:01,055
Your wife was great to meet.
I'm Jonas Nightengale.

237
00:20:01,266 --> 00:20:06,670
Come down for an old-fashioned
revival with lots of music and singing.

238
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:09,363
And bring your wife along tonight.

239
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,708
Bye-bye.

240
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:15,712
Thank you.

241
00:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,990
I been lonely, I been cheated

242
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:30,184
I been misunderstood

243
00:20:30,395 --> 00:20:35,059
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good

244
00:20:35,267 --> 00:20:40,261
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong

245
00:20:40,472 --> 00:20:42,997
There's a change in my life...

246
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,676
Hey, what's your name?

247
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:50,439
You go to high school here?
No? Going to college?

248
00:20:50,649 --> 00:20:56,110
Now, a man, a man gets crazy
When he finds he's done wrong

249
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:00,883
And a heart, a heart gets weary
When it doesn't belong

250
00:21:01,093 --> 00:21:07,123
And the road, the road gets rocky, Lord
You've got to keep on

251
00:21:07,332 --> 00:21:13,794
Let the new light come
Shining on through

252
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,532
I been lonely, I been cheated...

253
00:21:18,043 --> 00:21:20,910
Tonight, tomorrow night and the next...

254
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:24,776
Hey, Jonas Nightengale.
How are you?

255
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:27,383
Keep your eye on the squirt gun.

256
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:30,885
One, two, three!

257
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,451
Gone.

258
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:38,426
Come to the tent meeting.
Miracles and wonders.

259
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:49,773
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong

260
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:55,345
There's a change in my life
Since you came along

261
00:21:55,547 --> 00:22:00,041
I been lonely, I been cheated
I been misunderstood

262
00:22:00,252 --> 00:22:05,155
I been washed up, I been put down
And told I'm no good

263
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:09,589
But with you I belong
'Cause you help me be strong

264
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:12,423
There's a change in my life

265
00:22:12,631 --> 00:22:15,065
Since you came along...

266
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:20,366
I sink this one,
you guys come to the meeting?

267
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,804
- Yeah, all right.
- OK.

268
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,639
Afternoon, sir.

269
00:23:31,309 --> 00:23:33,869
Sheriff sent me to check for violations.

270
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:37,105
I bet he did.
Go ahead, we're clean. Go on.

271
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,442
Knock yourself out.

272
00:23:41,553 --> 00:23:44,954
Great. It's a frigging hootenanny!

273
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:01,596
You've been very busy, Will.

274
00:24:01,807 --> 00:24:03,468
Just doing my job.

275
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:06,075
Yeah, I can see that.

276
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:09,543
It's been a long day.
Can I buy you a beer?

277
00:24:11,183 --> 00:24:14,949
Tell me, do most of the cops
fall for your act?

278
00:24:19,257 --> 00:24:20,554
Yeah.

279
00:24:20,759 --> 00:24:23,421
I'll bet they do.

280
00:24:23,628 --> 00:24:26,995
Well, ma'am, sorry about the drink,
but I'm on duty.

281
00:24:27,199 --> 00:24:32,831
No, no. My mom is "ma'am".
You can call me Jane.

282
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:36,136
All right.

283
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,138
Goodbye, Jane.

284
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:40,311
Goodbye, Will.

285
00:24:45,484 --> 00:24:47,850
Just kidding.

286
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:04,601
You have any towels?

287
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:07,601
Wow, nice room!

288
00:25:07,806 --> 00:25:10,775
What's the matter? You seem down.

289
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,803
I'm just bummed about Topeka.
I wanted to see that breeder.

290
00:25:17,883 --> 00:25:21,683
- You can't keep a Great Dane on a bus.
- Why not?

291
00:25:21,887 --> 00:25:24,720
Lt'd be great company.

292
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:29,287
Why don't you give this to me?
It looks better on me.

293
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:32,463
You'll get it when I die unless you kill me.

294
00:25:32,664 --> 00:25:35,633
And it's in my will that way.

295
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:45,302
- My offer still holds for a new angel.
- I can just see it.

296
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:50,812
"Wanted: Single tenor with interest
in gourmet cooking and mail fraud."

297
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:55,282
- What's new with Miss Congeniality?
- Nothing.

298
00:25:55,487 --> 00:26:00,117
And I'm using all my "A" material.
How could she not go for it?

299
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:03,192
So you strike out for once.
What do you care?

300
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:07,126
It's got me curious.
She's got fuming down to an art.

301
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,233
It's a matter of principle, like a quest.

302
00:26:10,435 --> 00:26:13,563
Sort of a Holy Grail of road pussy?

303
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:17,003
Eloquent as always.

304
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:20,568
Tambourines, T-shirts, bumper stickers!

305
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:22,906
Bibles! Tambourines!

306
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,181
Tambourines, T-shirts, bumper stickers!

307
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,219
Get your bibles here!

308
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:37,088
How are you doing this evening?
Come right in. Come right in.

309
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:40,628
Tambourines! Praise the Lord!

310
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:45,394
Bibles! T-shirts! Bumper stickers!

311
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:49,165
- Come on up!
- Come right in!

312
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:51,205
Bumper stickers!

313
00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:56,006
Have you ever seen anything
like that in your life?

314
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:03,582
- Bless you.
- Bless you. Come right on in.

315
00:27:06,057 --> 00:27:09,322
Come right on in.
Hi, how are you?

316
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,602
- Hey, how's it going?
- OK.

317
00:27:31,850 --> 00:27:34,785
Let's see what we've got.

318
00:27:34,986 --> 00:27:36,954
Where are you?

319
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,248
Oh, there you are. Nice suit!

320
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:43,490
Guys!

321
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,366
Excuse me. Are you from Rustwater?

322
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:55,562
- No, I drove 30 miles to be here.
- 30 miles. That far?

323
00:27:55,774 --> 00:27:58,368
- What is your name?
- Emma Schlarp.

324
00:27:58,576 --> 00:28:02,444
I have a great seat
right in front of the preacher for you.

325
00:28:02,647 --> 00:28:06,242
- Would you like to have it?
- Oh, yes.

326
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:10,080
Sit right here,
and I'll roll you down there.

327
00:28:10,288 --> 00:28:12,256
That's very nice of you.

328
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:16,416
It's a much better view
and this chair's a lot softer.

329
00:28:16,628 --> 00:28:18,459
Thank you.

330
00:28:18,663 --> 00:28:21,496
It's nothing but trouble with that old man.

331
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:26,069
He's got 80 yards of electrified fence
spitting distance to the house.

332
00:28:26,271 --> 00:28:30,731
You know our kids play over there,
and somebody's gonna get hurt.

333
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:37,512
...loving Jesus gives you
a warm feeling in your stomach...

334
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:41,049
Guy in cowboy hat
says he loves Jesus.

335
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:44,551
Really? I thought
they were just good friends.

336
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:47,350
Make sure to hit him up personally.

337
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,288
Absolutely.

338
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,689
- You like it?
- Yeah.

339
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:53,727
Cut it out, Matt!

340
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:57,629
- You here alone?
- I'm with my mom.

341
00:28:57,836 --> 00:29:01,533
If she catches me talking with you...
I gotta go, OK?

342
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,402
Can I see you after the show?

343
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,509
- OK. Nice to see you.
- You, too.

344
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,611
Girl in glitter jeans is pregnant.

345
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:16,218
Her mother's been beating her.
That's nice.

346
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:18,889
Where is she sitting?

347
00:29:20,158 --> 00:29:23,650
Town's small, Jonas.
Don't mention she's knocked up.

348
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,386
I'll be good.

349
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:27,929
Did you study my summary?

350
00:29:28,133 --> 00:29:33,230
Yeah. And the Grange ladies told me
who's been sleeping around.

351
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:37,272
Tiny, you got the smoke ready?

352
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:41,309
What's Roger doing?
Tell him five shills is enough.

353
00:29:41,513 --> 00:29:44,380
Come on, the angels will see him.

354
00:29:44,582 --> 00:29:47,915
What's the deal
with the cherry hat again?

355
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:52,488
Electric fence.
Visualise the fence with cherries on it.

356
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,888
- What do you like? This or this?
- Ready to check your receiver?

357
00:29:57,095 --> 00:30:00,258
I'm having an accessory crisis.

358
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:03,491
Testing sibilance, one, two.
Can you hear me?

359
00:30:03,701 --> 00:30:07,000
That's fine.
Boy, are you a tough room!

360
00:30:07,205 --> 00:30:10,106
The dark grey, definitely.

361
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:12,606
You look gorgeous.

362
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:15,473
Always look better than they do, Janey.

363
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:19,446
And now, let's go give
some empty lives a little meaning!

364
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:23,815
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- Ready as I can be!

365
00:30:24,022 --> 00:30:27,685
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- The spirit will set you free

366
00:30:27,892 --> 00:30:29,860
Are you ready? Are you ready?

367
00:30:37,302 --> 00:30:41,636
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- Ready as I can be

368
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,674
- Are you ready for a miracle?
- The spirit will set you free

369
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,984
Are you ready for a miracle?

370
00:30:59,123 --> 00:31:03,719
Be strong in the Lord
and in the power of his might!

371
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:09,332
Be strong in the Lord
and the power of his might!

372
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:13,595
Put on the whole armour of God
that ye may be able to stand

373
00:31:13,805 --> 00:31:15,864
against the wiles of the Devil!

374
00:31:16,074 --> 00:31:20,841
Come on, Hoov. Goose 'em.
I got a cold audience out there.

375
00:31:21,613 --> 00:31:23,740
Yes, I'm ready! Yeah!

376
00:31:23,948 --> 00:31:28,647
I hear Satan knocking,
but he can't come in! Yes, sir!

377
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,343
Come on, people!

378
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:34,218
Turn it loose,
let him fix it and let him in!

379
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:38,759
Take it down, angels.
I gotta talk to these people.

380
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:43,229
I gotta talk to these people a second.
I wanna tell you a story...

381
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,597
- This'll move you.
...about a man from New York.

382
00:31:46,804 --> 00:31:50,069
A man named Thomas.

383
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:53,676
Now, Thomas lived on Fifth Avenue.

384
00:31:53,878 --> 00:31:57,473
Views of Central Park
even from the bathroom!

385
00:31:57,682 --> 00:32:01,311
Beautiful wife. Two sweet kids.

386
00:32:01,519 --> 00:32:05,114
But his life was a mess.
You know why?

387
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:08,723
Because of the fear.

388
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,896
Afraid his business would fail.

389
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:14,929
Afraid his children would come to harm.

390
00:32:15,133 --> 00:32:17,897
Afraid of balding
and his wife leaving him.

391
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:21,538
Afraid of death.
But death's a breeze.

392
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:25,140
Ever heard of anyone
coming back to complain? No!

393
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:30,110
- It's life that'll kill you...
- Matt, give your people a wake-up call.

394
00:32:30,315 --> 00:32:32,875
...and Thomas was a prisoner of fear.

395
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:37,578
- Amen, Preacher!
- Praise the Lord! Hallelujah!

396
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:41,122
...he got a $2,000 hairpiece
and a world-class doctor.

397
00:32:41,326 --> 00:32:43,351
- But was Tom happy?
- No!

398
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:45,051
No! N-O.

399
00:32:45,263 --> 00:32:51,224
Because when Thomas finally
came to me, he still had the fear.

400
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:57,841
The fear is bigger than doctors!
The fear is bigger than money!

401
00:32:58,042 --> 00:32:59,566
- Absolutely!
- Amen!

402
00:32:59,777 --> 00:33:04,510
There's only thing bigger
than the fear, my friends.

403
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:09,278
And that one thing... is the faith.

404
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:11,978
- Hallelujah!
- Yeah! Yeah!

405
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:14,590
Faith that the universe needs him!

406
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:17,955
Faith that his woman
loves his soul not his hair!

407
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:23,327
Faith that his children will be protected
not by a man with a.357 Magnum,

408
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:28,938
but by The Man with the super-charged
grenade launcher of love!

409
00:33:31,409 --> 00:33:35,436
And that one man is one man
and one man only.

410
00:33:35,646 --> 00:33:37,477
That man is Jesus Christ!

411
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,507
Yeah!

412
00:33:40,718 --> 00:33:43,346
If you wanna feel happy,

413
00:33:43,554 --> 00:33:46,955
if you wanna feel love,
all you gotta do...

414
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,525
If you wanna feel safe,
if you wanna feel strong,

415
00:33:50,728 --> 00:33:54,061
if you wanna walk tall,
all you gotta do,

416
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:59,225
all you gotta do,
all you gotta do is get saved!

417
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,499
Thank you, Jesus!
Thank you, Jesus!

418
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,734
- Say "Hallelujah."
- Hallelujah!

419
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:12,348
- Looking good, Jo Jo.
- Holy juice pumps through my veins!

420
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,644
I feel a healing coming on.

421
00:34:20,358 --> 00:34:24,021
But I need to know
you're on the side of the Lord.

422
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,822
I need a sign of your faith.

423
00:34:27,031 --> 00:34:30,694
I'm not asking you to pay
for this beautiful music, no!

424
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:34,235
I'm not asking you to pay
for the word of God.

425
00:34:34,439 --> 00:34:37,966
What I do need is
some token that you believe.

426
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:43,239
- How about that ruby ring?
- You belong to the most exclusive club!

427
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:47,316
A club that only God's
faithful and generous can join.

428
00:34:47,518 --> 00:34:50,248
- Only then...
- Give me that ring!

429
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:53,618
No one can keep you
out of the kingdom of heaven!

430
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:58,057
- Tell her I'm gonna kill her!
- You're meat, baby.

431
00:34:58,262 --> 00:35:00,696
OK, I'll be good!

432
00:35:00,898 --> 00:35:03,924
They are going to pass among you.

433
00:35:04,135 --> 00:35:08,367
- The more you give, the more you live!
- Praise the Lord, brother!

434
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:14,239
The Lord spoke to me tonight.
He's searching for some special people.

435
00:35:14,445 --> 00:35:17,778
They'll receive great rewards
in material goods.

436
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:22,578
He wants these special people
to be saved here on stage with me!

437
00:35:23,654 --> 00:35:27,181
It's sad out there, that's all I have to say.

438
00:35:27,391 --> 00:35:29,222
It's burgers tonight.

439
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,300
Oh, people,
the Lord is speaking to me right now.

440
00:35:40,505 --> 00:35:45,499
- It better be good.
- Relax. Cherry hat. Section 4, row F.

441
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:49,271
You, sir, in the brown jacket.
I feel your burden.

442
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:51,107
Who? Who, me?

443
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:54,876
Yes, sir. Tell me
if I'm hearing the Lord right.

444
00:35:55,086 --> 00:35:59,022
- You've a problem with your neighbour?
- I sure have!

445
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:02,590
- That fence is going to harm your kids?
- Yes, sir!

446
00:36:02,793 --> 00:36:04,522
Amazing!

447
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:08,790
...make him your friend,
serve him your best fried chicken!

448
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,436
- 'Cause yours is the best in the county.
- It is!

449
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:16,437
I'd love some of that.
Now thank the Lord for his saving!

450
00:36:19,477 --> 00:36:24,414
Section 5, row A is the glitter jeans.
Remember glitter jeans?

451
00:36:24,615 --> 00:36:26,446
Sister!

452
00:36:26,651 --> 00:36:30,815
You're suffering deeply.
You're worried about your little girl.

453
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:33,013
- Yes, Reverend.
- Stand up.

454
00:36:33,224 --> 00:36:37,422
The Lord says a strike unto any
of his children is a strike unto him.

455
00:36:37,628 --> 00:36:40,688
Lord, I hear you. Please forgive me.

456
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:45,631
- Jesus forgives you. Say "Hallelujah!"
- Hallelujah!

457
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:52,475
Fishing cap, section 4, row F.

458
00:36:55,479 --> 00:37:00,507
You, sir. Come up on stage
and be cured of your gambling!

459
00:37:00,718 --> 00:37:05,587
That's incredible!
Section 1, pink mu-mu. She lost her job.

460
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:07,485
You, in the pink dress.

461
00:37:07,692 --> 00:37:11,492
Receive the Lord
and you will find another job!

462
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,221
First row. White shirt. Back problem.

463
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:19,093
You, sir. Believe in the Lord
and cure your backache!

464
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:21,794
Same section, yellow shirt.
Hearing problem.

465
00:37:22,006 --> 00:37:24,998
You, sir, come up on stage!

466
00:37:25,209 --> 00:37:26,836
Hearing problem!

467
00:37:27,878 --> 00:37:31,609
Section 2, the blue-haired lady.
She's got arthritis.

468
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:34,944
You, too, ma'am. Come up on stage!

469
00:37:35,152 --> 00:37:39,282
- We're gonna help some people.
- Ah, we are!

470
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:49,096
- He's got trouble with his neighbours.
- Let him fix it! Let him in!

471
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,360
Hallelujah!

472
00:37:54,372 --> 00:37:57,102
I'm feeling something tonight!

473
00:37:57,308 --> 00:38:02,075
- He's got a sore neck.
- Receive the anointing in Jesus' name!

474
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:05,875
- Say, "Thank you, Jesus!"
- She needs a job.

475
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:09,348
You need a job?
Now you're working for Jesus!

476
00:38:09,553 --> 00:38:13,182
- A gambling man.
- Get the strength in your life!

477
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,450
Holy name of Jesus!

478
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:19,289
- He can't hear a thing.
- Hear the word, hear the word!

479
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:22,557
In Jesus' holy name!

480
00:38:25,069 --> 00:38:28,334
- Welcome to the kingdom of heaven.
- Arthritis.

481
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:32,100
Arthritis? Take the hand
of God's right-hand man.

482
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:35,609
Believe in the power of the Lord. Believe.

483
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:39,180
Raise your hands. Raise them up!

484
00:38:39,383 --> 00:38:41,681
Wave your hands like this!

485
00:38:41,886 --> 00:38:43,513
Thank you, Jesus!

486
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:47,020
Someone here's just been
cured of their asthma.

487
00:38:47,224 --> 00:38:48,953
Hello, friend!

488
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,492
She's got bad bones, Reverend.

489
00:38:51,696 --> 00:38:53,357
Hold it, hold it!

490
00:38:53,564 --> 00:38:56,692
Take it down just a second.
Take it down.

491
00:38:56,901 --> 00:38:59,267
We got someone special here.

492
00:38:59,470 --> 00:39:01,631
- What's your name?
- Emma Schlarp.

493
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,774
- How long you had bone trouble?
- Years.

494
00:39:04,975 --> 00:39:10,140
Well, God's gonna make
a miracle for you tonight.

495
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:13,408
O Lord, I'm just a man like any other,

496
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:18,247
but send a miracle through my hands
to help my sister Emma.

497
00:39:23,761 --> 00:39:27,822
Come on, Emma.
Show me the power of the Lord.

498
00:39:33,738 --> 00:39:36,104
Praise God. Praise God.

499
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,571
Praise God!

500
00:39:39,777 --> 00:39:42,541
Thank you, Jesus. Come on, walk to me.

501
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:44,840
Go on, Emma!

502
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:48,847
Yes! Yes!

503
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,412
It's a miracle! Hallelujah!

504
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:56,218
It's a miracle! Dance with me!

505
00:39:56,427 --> 00:40:00,887
Oh, say, "Thank you, Jesus."
Thank you, Jesus!

506
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:04,531
And I'm walking...

507
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:08,364
Highway up to heaven

508
00:40:08,572 --> 00:40:10,904
No one can walk up there
But the pure in heart

509
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,975
It's a highway up to heaven

510
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:20,708
And I'm walking...
I'm so glad it's a highway up to heaven

511
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,376
You just can't walk up there
You got to be pure in heart

512
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:27,489
It's a highway up to heaven...

513
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:30,091
Thank you. Thank Jesus!

514
00:40:30,294 --> 00:40:32,854
In the name of Jesus!

515
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:06,119
- How did we do?
- About four grand.

516
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:18,269
Hey, Tony, I'm dressing!

517
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,101
Sorry, pal.

518
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:33,890
What's he doing here?

519
00:41:37,127 --> 00:41:40,426
Well, well.
If it isn't my new best friend.

520
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:44,260
We've had the fire department,
the sanitation department.

521
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,902
What now? The Girl Scouts?

522
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:51,200
Nightengale, we both know
there's nothing I can do legally.

523
00:41:51,408 --> 00:41:53,273
I'm here man to man.

524
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:58,437
Folks have lost their jobs, their land.
They can't feed their families.

525
00:41:58,649 --> 00:42:01,777
So they sure can't afford
a con man like you.

526
00:42:01,986 --> 00:42:05,422
Do a good thing. Pack it up.

527
00:42:06,657 --> 00:42:12,027
That's some plain talk, Will.
So I'll give you a little in return.

528
00:42:12,229 --> 00:42:14,925
- Good night, folks.
- Night, sir.

529
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:22,300
Let's assume I was
what you said I was.

530
00:42:22,506 --> 00:42:26,408
In New York, they've got
Broadway shows costing $65 a pop

531
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,340
just to walk in the door.

532
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:36,043
Maybe you like the show.
Maybe you don't, and you kick yourself.

533
00:42:36,253 --> 00:42:38,619
I give my people a good show,

534
00:42:38,822 --> 00:42:42,019
plenty of music,
worthwhile sentiments.

535
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,889
Most of them go home
with a little hope in their lives.

536
00:42:46,096 --> 00:42:51,124
Now, usually, I only play towns
that can afford me.

537
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:54,862
But what about towns like this
that really need me?

538
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:59,270
You don't care what these people need.
You're looking to cash in.

539
00:42:59,476 --> 00:43:02,445
Oh, pissing contest! Can I watch?

540
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:10,448
- I won't just go away.
- Now, that sounds good!

541
00:43:10,654 --> 00:43:16,286
'Cause you owe me that drink, Will.
Jonas, in the bus.

542
00:43:17,461 --> 00:43:22,023
Will, what's that guy from
the sanitation department's name?

543
00:43:22,232 --> 00:43:26,498
- Phil.
- Phil? I called him Frank. Anyway...

544
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:45,848
Come on, Janey! Wake up, baby!

545
00:43:46,056 --> 00:43:48,957
God! It's eight o'clock!

546
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:52,560
I know what time it is.
I've been driving all night.

547
00:43:52,763 --> 00:43:55,857
Wait till you see this. Close your eyes.

548
00:43:56,066 --> 00:43:59,160
- They were closed.
- Come on, close them.

549
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:01,065
Pucker up.

550
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:03,865
Kiss. Big kiss.

551
00:44:05,943 --> 00:44:08,275
Wow!

552
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,879
Hi! Where did you get him?

553
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:15,108
I found a breeder in Clydedale.
I convinced him to open late.

554
00:44:15,319 --> 00:44:18,049
Ah, so let's hear it for insomnia.

555
00:44:18,255 --> 00:44:22,191
I was worried about
your lack of companionship.

556
00:44:22,393 --> 00:44:25,556
- What's his name?
- He's smart and hung like a moose.

557
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:28,823
- So I thought...
- Jack from Neptune!

558
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:32,298
- Come on!
- I know, Jonas Junior.

559
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:36,599
- Jonas! He's a good boy, too!
- He's great.

560
00:44:38,709 --> 00:44:42,406
So here we'll make "such" as "drought",
"really" is "rain".

561
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:46,606
- And we'll make "won't" "tornadoes".
- OK, try me.

562
00:44:46,817 --> 00:44:52,414
"Brother Jonas, I am wondering,
what question burns inside this woman."

563
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:56,286
If there'll be a twister
at her son's home in Wilmington.

564
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:59,587
- No, "wondering" is "Wichita".
- Wichita!

565
00:44:59,797 --> 00:45:03,665
- I don't wanna do this audience tonight.
- Why? You're good.

566
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:08,634
- That's not the point.
- Relax. Pathos isn't contagious.

567
00:45:10,574 --> 00:45:15,034
Besides, the badge saw the set-up
last night. We can't take the chance.

568
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:20,012
- What did you two do after dinner?
- Nothing. I'm just greasing the wheels.

569
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:24,779
- Till one in the morning? A lot of grease.
- Your spies are slipping.

570
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:27,013
I was out till two.

571
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:31,718
You know how to play this, Jane.
Just watch your step!

572
00:45:35,866 --> 00:45:39,427
Mr Nightengale, I'm so glad I caught you.

573
00:45:39,636 --> 00:45:42,002
I was at your meeting last night,

574
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:46,233
and I heard what you said
to that family who lost their farm.

575
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:52,780
My husband lost his job, and
it's been hard putting food on the table.

576
00:45:52,983 --> 00:45:57,113
Sorry to hear that. Come down tonight
and maybe I can help.

577
00:45:57,321 --> 00:46:00,518
Oh, heavens, it's not me.

578
00:46:00,724 --> 00:46:06,094
The best way to forget your troubles
is to help someone else with theirs.

579
00:46:06,296 --> 00:46:09,697
This is for that unfortunate family.

580
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:12,926
Will you see that they get it?

581
00:46:13,137 --> 00:46:16,504
I certainly will.
That's mighty Christian of you.

582
00:46:16,707 --> 00:46:18,675
Bless you.

583
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,538
You try it and you're toast!

584
00:46:32,723 --> 00:46:35,055
You're gonna get it now!

585
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:49,399
Hey, Rev!
Looking for some souls to save?

586
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:54,771
You know me, I hate to see
even one get away. Souls, that is.

587
00:46:56,547 --> 00:46:59,641
I brought you this. It's the best in town.

588
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,013
- Hey, kid. How about a game?
- Da.

589
00:47:03,220 --> 00:47:06,485
- I thought you had homework.
- I'll do it later.

590
00:47:06,690 --> 00:47:08,419
Little Russkie, huh?

591
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:13,320
I ever tell you I was
East Coast chess champion 1971?

592
00:47:15,632 --> 00:47:18,999
My sister's a total slave-driver.

593
00:47:19,203 --> 00:47:24,402
- Go ahead and make your move.
- What do you think I just did?

594
00:47:24,608 --> 00:47:27,236
That was a neat trick you did yesterday.

595
00:47:27,444 --> 00:47:30,880
- The hand's quicker than the eye.
- So they tell me.

596
00:47:37,554 --> 00:47:40,387
Nice move, kid.

597
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,787
Hey, Marva, could I have a thé glacé?

598
00:47:45,996 --> 00:47:48,692
It's French for iced tea.

599
00:47:48,899 --> 00:47:53,302
- Where's your church?
- On every street corner in every town.

600
00:47:53,503 --> 00:47:58,634
- You don't have a church.
- I have a ministry, which is better.

601
00:47:58,842 --> 00:48:01,470
My grandmother
used to take me with her.

602
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:06,239
So you believe in miracles, right?

603
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:09,783
Concentrate on your game, Boyd.

604
00:48:09,987 --> 00:48:13,787
I'd like to hear what your sister
has to say on the subject.

605
00:48:13,991 --> 00:48:18,951
I believe in life, what it does to you
and what you do back.

606
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:24,960
Never underestimate the power of belief.

607
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:30,003
With it, I've seen a mute sing "Hallelujah"
and a cripple dance.

608
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:35,741
When you've got it, you've got the power
of every ocean in your hand.

609
00:48:35,946 --> 00:48:38,972
Without it, you've got nothing.

610
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:44,677
Everyone is just another sinner,
and everywhere is just another hell.

611
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:55,224
I'll be outside.

612
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:02,804
- My sister thinks you're a fake.
- Maybe I am and maybe I'm not.

613
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:07,739
If I get the job done,
what difference does it make?

614
00:49:07,945 --> 00:49:12,314
You're gonna need a miracle now,
because check and mate-ski!

615
00:49:24,294 --> 00:49:27,559
This town is full of single women.
Leave me alone.

616
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:30,699
It must be your money.

617
00:49:34,137 --> 00:49:40,007
I've seen many people lie to themselves,
but they don't fool anyone.

618
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,407
Lying, huh?
Your personal area of expertise?

619
00:49:43,613 --> 00:49:47,777
That's not true.
My talent is telling people the truth.

620
00:49:49,453 --> 00:49:54,413
Like that picture on the wall in there.
Best day of your life.

621
00:49:56,126 --> 00:49:58,094
- One of.
- Sure it was.

622
00:49:58,295 --> 00:50:01,264
You were young, you were free.

623
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:05,530
You still had that spark in your eye.

624
00:50:05,736 --> 00:50:11,675
Now you hide out in that diner,
never letting anyone get next to you.

625
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:15,072
The last time you had a man
Nixon was in office.

626
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:20,113
How I live my life is none
of your business. What do you want?

627
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:23,718
I want to know how come you gave up.

628
00:50:30,060 --> 00:50:32,995
A drunk truck driver did that.

629
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:38,259
Four hours stuck in a crash
watching our mom and dad die.

630
00:50:38,468 --> 00:50:43,667
Doctors did all they could.
Took tests, stuck him with needles.

631
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,638
All for nothing.

632
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:49,573
So he had me take him to a preacher.

633
00:50:49,780 --> 00:50:52,806
And the preacher got him up on stage.

634
00:50:53,016 --> 00:50:56,884
When it was all over,
he was still on his crutches.

635
00:50:57,087 --> 00:50:59,681
Know what he said to my little brother?

636
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,950
He said that it was his fault,

637
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:06,323
'cause his faith wasn't strong enough.

638
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,725
Let me tell you something.

639
00:51:08,932 --> 00:51:11,992
All that boy has is faith.

640
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:16,605
The last thing he needs is
another phoney messing him up.

641
00:51:16,807 --> 00:51:22,370
And the last thing I need is another man
using him to get me into bed.

642
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:27,778
Hey, Rev, how about a rematch?

643
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:31,215
Sorry, kid, I gotta go.

644
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,685
Can't stand the heat, huh?

645
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:36,188
Got it in one, kid.

646
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:51,107
If I pick it too soon, it won't sweeten.

647
00:51:51,308 --> 00:51:55,244
If I leave it on the stock too long,
it rots on the way to market.

648
00:51:55,445 --> 00:52:00,712
Too much rain turns it mouldy,
too little and it's hog-feed.

649
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:02,680
Timing's everything.

650
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,854
Same as in my business.

651
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:08,024
You gotta pick 'em while they're ripe.

652
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:12,321
Will, I know you think I'm crooked,
so why'd you ask me here?

653
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,828
Well, you know those programmes

654
00:52:16,032 --> 00:52:20,594
where they take delinquents
out to the woods and rehabilitate them?

655
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,671
- This isn't the woods.
- Smart girl.

656
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,502
I knew you were worth saving.

657
00:52:29,279 --> 00:52:34,581
You've too much going for you
to be somebody's front man.

658
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,938
OK, guys, let's go!

659
00:53:06,917 --> 00:53:09,283
Pick it up!

660
00:53:11,154 --> 00:53:12,644
- Hey, Rev.
- Hey, kid.

661
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,585
Watch.

662
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:20,288
My dad used to lift weights.
He was state champion.

663
00:53:20,497 --> 00:53:25,662
- Great, comrade. You gonna compete?
- Yeah, all events done sitting down!

664
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,202
It's something I gotta do.
You have anything like that?

665
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:33,308
Something I gotta do?
No, I stick with what I wanna do.

666
00:53:33,510 --> 00:53:37,071
It's a tough policy, but it works for me.

667
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,078
Do you always jog in a cowboy hat?

668
00:53:40,283 --> 00:53:43,411
I used to jog in my boots.

669
00:53:47,257 --> 00:53:50,226
What did the doctors tell you?

670
00:53:50,427 --> 00:53:54,796
Doctors have nothing to do with my leg.
I'll walk if it's God's will.

671
00:53:54,998 --> 00:53:58,957
Listen, God doesn't have
a trucker's licence.

672
00:53:59,169 --> 00:54:01,569
You think you were chosen to suffer?

673
00:54:01,771 --> 00:54:06,572
If you've done everything you can,
doctors, therapy, that's great.

674
00:54:06,776 --> 00:54:12,373
But if you haven't, get off your ass,
'cause God won't do it for you.

675
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:17,679
Look, kid,
everybody's a loser one of these days.

676
00:54:17,887 --> 00:54:21,152
The trick is not acting like a loser.

677
00:54:21,358 --> 00:54:25,055
I believe things happen for a reason.

678
00:54:25,262 --> 00:54:28,925
Fine. You wanna believe that?
That's great.

679
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:31,293
I'm gonna run.

680
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:14,137
Hi. Sorry I'm late.
I'm worried about that two-man code.

681
00:55:14,344 --> 00:55:17,802
Maybe. But that's not why you're late.

682
00:55:18,014 --> 00:55:20,175
These are for me?

683
00:55:25,055 --> 00:55:27,853
Can I read it?

684
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:32,495
Gidget goes dustbowl.
Fine, have your little secret.

685
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:37,462
Will said he's got a surprise for you.

686
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:40,135
Something about
giving you enough rope.

687
00:55:40,337 --> 00:55:43,033
Tell him to go kick some shit!

688
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:46,208
There's not enough rope in Kansas
to hang me.

689
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:50,209
Besides, wait till you see the pitch.

690
00:55:50,413 --> 00:55:51,711
Got a little surprise
