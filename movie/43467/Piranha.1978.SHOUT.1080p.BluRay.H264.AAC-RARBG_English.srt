1
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:04,149
- It's got to lead somewhere.

2
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,821
- Well, we'll stop and
make camp pretty soon.

3
00:01:10,822 --> 00:01:11,614
Got your breath?

4
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:14,616
- Yeah.

5
00:01:14,617 --> 00:01:15,368
Let's go.

6
00:01:24,544 --> 00:01:25,587
What is this?

7
00:01:30,133 --> 00:01:31,175
- It doesn't look like
anyone's been around here

8
00:01:31,176 --> 00:01:31,968
for a while.

9
00:01:32,844 --> 00:01:34,471
Let's go inside and check it out.

10
00:01:35,472 --> 00:01:36,347
- Think we should?

11
00:01:36,348 --> 00:01:39,016
- Barbara, who's going
to know the difference?

12
00:01:39,017 --> 00:01:40,477
Here we go.
- Okay.

13
00:01:46,816 --> 00:01:50,486
- Besides, a little
lawbreaking'll do you good.

14
00:02:02,123 --> 00:02:04,501
- I wonder why this
place wasn't on your map.

15
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:07,295
- Maybe it's
supposed to be a secret.

16
00:02:08,546 --> 00:02:09,339
- Maybe.

17
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:13,426
Hey!

18
00:02:16,471 --> 00:02:17,305
Far out!

19
00:02:31,736 --> 00:02:32,695
Feels great.

20
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:35,572
Come on, let's wash off

21
00:02:35,573 --> 00:02:38,617
so it won't be so funky
in that sleeping bag.

22
00:02:38,618 --> 00:02:39,911
- What if somebody catches us?

23
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:42,122
- Who's gonna catch us?

24
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:48,586
There's nobody here.

25
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:52,423
Let's get wet!

26
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:56,635
Last one in is a rotten egg.

27
00:02:56,636 --> 00:02:58,012
- Oh, that's really original.

28
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:02,224
Wait a minute.

29
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:03,017
- What?

30
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:05,519
- What if this is some kind of a

31
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:08,021
sewage treatment plant or something?

32
00:03:08,022 --> 00:03:09,064
- Idiot.

33
00:03:12,652 --> 00:03:14,111
- Oh, now you're gonna get it!

34
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:14,904
- Oh!

35
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:19,826
How is it?

36
00:03:23,746 --> 00:03:24,955
Here I come!

37
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,464
- Hey, that's not funny!

38
00:03:34,465 --> 00:03:35,300
- What?

39
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,134
- Well, you bit me.

40
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:38,343
I can't believe you actually bit me.

41
00:03:38,344 --> 00:03:40,929
- What do I look like, a
creature from the black lagoon?

42
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:42,681
You are paranoid, kid.

43
00:03:42,682 --> 00:03:45,601
Listen, I'll race you to the deep end!

44
00:03:45,602 --> 00:03:47,645
- Well, something bit me!

45
00:04:05,705 --> 00:04:06,497
Barbara!

46
00:04:06,498 --> 00:04:08,999
Barbara, there's something in here!

47
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:09,792
- David!

48
00:04:12,086 --> 00:04:12,879
David!

49
00:04:21,387 --> 00:04:22,180
David?

50
00:04:26,267 --> 00:04:27,060
David!

51
00:04:30,897 --> 00:04:32,649
David!

52
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:12,516
- Paging Mr. Patrick Hoppy.

53
00:07:12,517 --> 00:07:14,976
Mr. Patrick Hoppy to the white
courtesy telephone, please.

54
00:07:16,562 --> 00:07:17,646
- Rent a Jeep?

55
00:07:17,647 --> 00:07:19,648
- She'll be traveling on
unpaved mountain roads

56
00:07:19,649 --> 00:07:20,525
and unless you want to be--

57
00:07:20,526 --> 00:07:22,568
- All right, all right,
all right, where do I sign?

58
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:27,280
- The white zone
is for immediate loading...

59
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:30,158
- Okay, we're all set and
when you get to Indian Springs

60
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:30,993
you'll get a Jeep.

61
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:32,869
The roads are very rough there.

62
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,663
- No sweat.

63
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,040
Hey, look, I can handle it.

64
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:37,917
- Oh, I know you can.

65
00:07:37,918 --> 00:07:39,501
I wouldn't send you if I
didn't think you could.

66
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:40,336
Come on, come on.

67
00:07:40,337 --> 00:07:42,045
- Wait, wait, wait.

68
00:07:42,046 --> 00:07:43,005
Got ya!

69
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:46,800
I found the bigamist, didn't I?

70
00:07:46,801 --> 00:07:47,635
- Right.

71
00:07:47,636 --> 00:07:49,261
- And the bad check lady, Mrs. Pilgrim.

72
00:07:49,262 --> 00:07:50,054
- Right.

73
00:07:50,054 --> 00:07:50,972
- And I found Moe Schneider.

74
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:53,515
- Yeah, three times, but
those were all in town.

75
00:07:53,516 --> 00:07:54,975
You're strictly a city kid and

76
00:07:54,976 --> 00:07:56,351
these kids are way out in the boon--

77
00:07:56,352 --> 00:07:58,311
- I can find anything, Earl.

78
00:07:58,312 --> 00:07:59,646
I'm two-thirds bloodhound.

79
00:07:59,647 --> 00:08:01,315
I told you that when you hired me.

80
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,526
- Paging Mr. Bo Wax.

81
00:08:04,527 --> 00:08:05,527
Bo Wax come to the white
courtesy telephone.

82
00:08:05,528 --> 00:08:06,987
- Oh, my gosh!

83
00:08:06,988 --> 00:08:08,488
Oh, my gosh, my ticket!

84
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:10,198
I could have sworn I put it in my pocket!

85
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:11,659
Where's my ticket?

86
00:08:17,915 --> 00:08:19,249
I can manage it.

87
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,084
- Of course you can.

88
00:08:20,085 --> 00:08:22,127
- It's money in the bank.

89
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:23,087
- My money.

90
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,158
- Hey, Brandy.

91
00:08:53,117 --> 00:08:54,494
How are you, huh?

92
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:56,745
- Hey, Paul!
- Hey, old man.

93
00:08:56,746 --> 00:09:00,165
Lagging behind, huh?

94
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,458
- I'm telling you, this hike from town

95
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,752
is getting longer every week.

96
00:09:03,753 --> 00:09:05,754
- You oughta get a car, Jack.

97
00:09:05,755 --> 00:09:08,131
- I got a car.

98
00:09:08,132 --> 00:09:10,425
It's up on blocks,
that's where it belongs.

99
00:09:14,722 --> 00:09:15,515
Scotch.

100
00:09:17,767 --> 00:09:18,559
Gin.

101
00:09:20,853 --> 00:09:21,646
Bourbon.

102
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,070
Tequila!

103
00:09:30,071 --> 00:09:32,322
- Ah!

104
00:09:32,323 --> 00:09:34,741
You're the Seventh Cavalry, Jack.

105
00:09:34,742 --> 00:09:37,327
You know, I just ran dry today.

106
00:09:37,328 --> 00:09:38,912
- Your cornmeal is down there,

107
00:09:38,913 --> 00:09:41,081
but I ain't gonna walk
down there and get it.

108
00:09:41,082 --> 00:09:43,000
- Man cannot live by booze alone.

109
00:09:47,463 --> 00:09:48,755
In lieu of rent.

110
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:50,090
- Okay, that's fine.

111
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:52,050
- So what's up in town?

112
00:09:52,051 --> 00:09:53,677
- Same as usual.

113
00:09:53,678 --> 00:09:56,471
- I bet you miss it, Jack, huh?

114
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:58,807
I bet you miss selling whatever it was,

115
00:09:58,808 --> 00:10:00,935
that plastic fruit.

116
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:02,853
- No.

117
00:10:04,397 --> 00:10:05,481
Got the river.

118
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:10,403
It wakes me up in the morning.

119
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,324
Gives me a bath.

120
00:10:16,951 --> 00:10:19,745
Does my laundry.

121
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:22,582
Gives me dinner.

122
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,751
Puts me to sleep real gentle.

123
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,712
I got my river.

124
00:10:29,422 --> 00:10:30,214
I got Brandy.

125
00:10:33,384 --> 00:10:34,176
Paul.

126
00:10:38,014 --> 00:10:39,974
What do you got up here?

127
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:45,395
- I got scotch, gin, bourbon, and tequila.

128
00:10:45,396 --> 00:10:46,897
What's it to you, anyhow?

129
00:10:47,857 --> 00:10:49,316
- Okay.

130
00:10:49,317 --> 00:10:50,735
Okay, buddy, I'll see you.

131
00:10:52,361 --> 00:10:53,195
Okay, come on.

132
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:54,863
Come on, come on.

133
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,573
- Take it easy, Brandy.

134
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:28,773
- Ow!

135
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:35,821
Ah!

136
00:11:41,243 --> 00:11:42,327
Hmm.

137
00:11:58,094 --> 00:11:58,886
- It's open.

138
00:12:02,848 --> 00:12:03,641
- Paul Grogan?

139
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:08,520
Hi, I'm Maggie McKeown.

140
00:12:08,521 --> 00:12:10,480
I work for a skip-tracing company.

141
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,648
- What's that?

142
00:12:11,649 --> 00:12:13,650
- We find missing people.

143
00:12:13,651 --> 00:12:15,152
- Did my ex-wife send you?

144
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,113
- No.

145
00:12:18,197 --> 00:12:19,031
Um...

146
00:12:20,032 --> 00:12:22,867
I'm looking for a pair of teenage kids.

147
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:23,910
Some friends of theirs said that they

148
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,995
might have gone backpacking up here.

149
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,205
- Well, I haven't seen 'em.

150
00:12:27,206 --> 00:12:29,457
You talk to the sheriff's people?

151
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:31,501
- They said
it was a big mountain.

152
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:32,586
- They're right, it is.

153
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:37,257
- Well, I figured they may
have followed along the river.

154
00:12:37,258 --> 00:12:39,718
Are there any places to swim near here?

155
00:12:39,719 --> 00:12:42,137
- Well, if they'd drowned,
they'd be swept down

156
00:12:42,138 --> 00:12:43,847
to the dam, you see.

157
00:12:43,848 --> 00:12:46,099
So you're starting at the wrong end.

158
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,477
- Boy, you're
the wrong end, all right.

159
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:52,939
Look, uh, am I interrupting something?

160
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,482
I mean, this is kind of important.

161
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,276
- Hey.

162
00:12:56,485 --> 00:12:58,028
You cool your jets, lady.

163
00:12:58,946 --> 00:13:00,739
I didn't ax-murder your young couple.

164
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,658
I can't help you, I haven't seen 'em.

165
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,247
- Are there any
other shacks up here?

166
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:10,749
- Cabins.

167
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,250
This is a cabin.

168
00:13:12,251 --> 00:13:13,085
- Well, are there any more of them?

169
00:13:13,086 --> 00:13:15,087
Any places where they might be holed up?

170
00:13:16,338 --> 00:13:20,258
- Well, there's
an old fella named Jack,

171
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:22,845
has a place downriver a
bit, but he's not with them.

172
00:13:24,388 --> 00:13:27,140
And there was some kind
of um, Army test site

173
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,350
way up the mountain, but that closed down

174
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:31,144
five, six years ago.

175
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,145
- Come on, let's go.

176
00:13:32,146 --> 00:13:33,271
- Go where?

177
00:13:33,272 --> 00:13:34,607
- You're taking me up there.

178
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:38,651
- Oh, no, I'm not.

179
00:13:43,407 --> 00:13:45,784
- You think I'm wasting
my time here, don't you?

180
00:13:45,785 --> 00:13:47,202
- No.

181
00:13:47,203 --> 00:13:49,747
I think you're wasting my time.

182
00:14:18,442 --> 00:14:20,360
You find anything yet?

183
00:14:20,361 --> 00:14:23,823
- Not yet, but it's
still early in the day.

184
00:15:03,529 --> 00:15:06,155
David!

185
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:06,949
Barbara!

186
00:15:21,046 --> 00:15:22,672
What were they testing here?

187
00:15:22,673 --> 00:15:24,299
- Who knows?

188
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,801
I hiked up here once with my ex-wife.

189
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:28,136
They had guard dogs out,

190
00:15:28,137 --> 00:15:30,014
the fence was electrified, the works.

191
00:15:38,814 --> 00:15:41,150
- BR, Barbara Randolph.

192
00:15:42,693 --> 00:15:43,485
- Hmm.

193
00:15:49,783 --> 00:15:51,492
Man, that is cold.

194
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:54,162
- Their parents said they
were both excellent swimmers.

195
00:15:54,163 --> 00:15:57,206
- Well, wouldn't they be
floating up on top by now?

196
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:59,959
- It takes a while for the
body to bloat with gas.

197
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,211
- Nice business you're in.

198
00:16:02,463 --> 00:16:04,757
- You think there's a way to
pull the plug on this thing?

199
00:16:12,556 --> 00:16:13,599
- Tropical fish?

200
00:16:14,516 --> 00:16:16,351
- Looks like it's for laboratory rats.

201
00:16:16,352 --> 00:16:17,518
You know, where they
have to make it through

202
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,313
an obstacle course to get a reward.

203
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,398
- Hmm.

204
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,618
- Still warm.

205
00:17:29,758 --> 00:17:30,842
- Come here.

206
00:17:30,843 --> 00:17:32,469
Take a look at this.

207
00:17:36,724 --> 00:17:37,516
- Yuck.

208
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,774
- Let's get outta here.

209
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,277
This place gives me the creeps.

210
00:18:04,710 --> 00:18:05,919
Hey, wait, you...

211
00:18:10,966 --> 00:18:13,260
- Well, they've been here all right.

212
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:17,222
And they never left.

213
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:22,769
I say we drain the pond.

214
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:23,645
- Well, now.

215
00:18:23,646 --> 00:18:25,229
Now, wait a minute.

216
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,397
I mean, you can't do that without

217
00:18:26,398 --> 00:18:28,567
getting somebody's permission, you know.

218
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:32,570
- Well, if it still works
it's the quickest way

219
00:18:32,571 --> 00:18:34,238
to know if they're down there or not.

220
00:18:34,239 --> 00:18:35,907
- What are you doing?

221
00:18:35,908 --> 00:18:38,452
You!

222
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,204
- Wait!

223
00:19:09,525 --> 00:19:10,943
Are you all right?

224
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:17,990
- He's breathing.

225
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:18,991
- No thanks to you.

226
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,034
- Well, what was I supposed to do?

227
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:21,786
He had you by the throat!

228
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:22,746
- I woulda got loose in a second.

229
00:19:22,746 --> 00:19:23,580
- Oh!

230
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,540
- Look at this!

231
00:19:24,541 --> 00:19:25,873
You put a dent in it!

232
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,668
- Could I have a sip of that, please?

233
00:19:29,128 --> 00:19:29,920
- It's not water.

234
00:19:41,181 --> 00:19:41,974
- What is it?

235
00:19:43,267 --> 00:19:44,226
- Water's salty.

236
00:19:48,188 --> 00:19:49,772
- Where does this drain to?

237
00:19:49,773 --> 00:19:52,441
- It was a fish hatchery
before the Army took it over.

238
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:54,570
Probably drains
underground into the river.

239
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:57,072
- Uh-oh.

240
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:05,330
- I think it's a dog.

241
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,209
Well, I don't suppose they
would have fit through here.

242
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,378
- Not in one piece.

243
00:20:14,631 --> 00:20:16,300
You think he's all right up there?

244
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,054
- Oh, shit!

245
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:26,101
- Oh, my God.

246
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,324
- I guess I must have
left the keys in it, huh?

247
00:21:10,687 --> 00:21:11,480
- Oh...

248
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:21,530
- He's alive!

249
00:21:21,531 --> 00:21:22,574
- He's indestructible.

250
00:21:24,034 --> 00:21:25,243
- Ah!

251
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:26,285
Ah!
- Easy!

252
00:21:26,286 --> 00:21:27,453
Easy, now, easy.

253
00:21:27,454 --> 00:21:28,247
Easy.

254
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,165
- Razorteeth.

255
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,708
- What's Razorteeth?

256
00:21:32,709 --> 00:21:33,709
- You drained the pond?

257
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,544
- Yes, we found--

258
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:35,462
- You let them out?

259
00:21:35,463 --> 00:21:36,463
- Let who out?

260
00:21:36,463 --> 00:21:37,297
- You okay?
- Who'd we let out?

261
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:38,547
- What's he doing?

262
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,174
- You don't know what you've done!

263
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:41,300
Untie me!

264
00:21:41,301 --> 00:21:42,135
Untie me, I've gotta--

265
00:21:42,136 --> 00:21:44,887
- The question is what
you've done, mister.

266
00:21:44,888 --> 00:21:46,681
- You don't know.

267
00:21:46,682 --> 00:21:47,891
They breed like flies.

268
00:21:48,892 --> 00:21:50,685
There'll be no way to stop them.

269
00:21:50,686 --> 00:21:52,228
- Would you talk sense, dammit?

270
00:21:52,229 --> 00:21:54,397
Now, what about those kids?

271
00:21:54,398 --> 00:21:55,439
- I can't tell you.

272
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:56,482
I can't tell you.

273
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,525
Oh, Mother of God, they'll kill us,

274
00:21:57,526 --> 00:21:58,443
they'll kill all of us.

275
00:21:58,444 --> 00:22:00,111
- Okay, mister, listen.

276
00:22:00,112 --> 00:22:02,155
They're gonna sweat it out of you in town.

277
00:22:04,116 --> 00:22:05,616
- They'll kill us.

278
00:22:05,617 --> 00:22:07,077
What have we done?

279
00:22:20,090 --> 00:22:23,218
Oh, my God.

280
00:22:34,604 --> 00:22:36,772
- He thinks someone's going to kill him.

281
00:22:36,773 --> 00:22:38,190
- He's right.

282
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:40,068
I am, if he steps out of line.

283
00:22:41,945 --> 00:22:43,529
- Do you have any cigarettes?

284
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:44,448
- No.

285
00:22:44,449 --> 00:22:45,865
Quit a year ago.

286
00:22:45,866 --> 00:22:46,700
Interfered with my drinking.

287
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,492
- Hmm.

288
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:50,495
Do you mind if I come in for a minute?

289
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:52,873
- Sure.

290
00:23:00,005 --> 00:23:02,006
- So did you start
drinking before or after?

291
00:23:02,007 --> 00:23:03,800
- Before or after what?

292
00:23:05,093 --> 00:23:06,345
- Your wife left you.

293
00:23:07,387 --> 00:23:09,638
- What the hell kind of question is that?

294
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:12,684
- Look, I'm sorry, I mean,
I was just interested.

295
00:23:17,314 --> 00:23:18,106
Um...

296
00:23:19,191 --> 00:23:20,442
Do you mind if I sit here?

297
00:23:22,694 --> 00:23:23,487
- Go ahead.

298
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:32,746
- How long were you married?

299
00:23:33,663 --> 00:23:34,498
- Hmm?

300
00:23:34,499 --> 00:23:37,042
Um, 10 years.

301
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,546
She was just 17 when we
eloped in her father's car.

302
00:23:44,091 --> 00:23:46,343
Man, we thought we had
the world by the balls.

303
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:52,432
- Where'd you live?

304
00:23:53,558 --> 00:23:55,059
- In town.

305
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:58,229
I worked in a smelting
operation downriver.

306
00:23:58,230 --> 00:23:59,480
Then the government closed us down,

307
00:23:59,481 --> 00:24:01,524
said we were killing too many fish.

308
00:24:01,525 --> 00:24:04,652
They gave it to the Army
and the Army sold it

309
00:24:04,653 --> 00:24:06,779
to some resort outfit.

310
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,781
So you know that
somebody's making a bundle

311
00:24:08,782 --> 00:24:10,825
somewheres along the line.

312
00:24:10,826 --> 00:24:12,952
- How do you make a living now?

313
00:24:12,953 --> 00:24:15,247
- Oh, back pay, unemployment.

314
00:24:16,289 --> 00:24:19,000
I'm gonna have to go to
work come September, yeah.

315
00:24:20,419 --> 00:24:22,003
Keep my daughter in saddle shoes.

316
00:24:24,005 --> 00:24:25,965
- Does your daughter live with you?

317
00:24:25,966 --> 00:24:26,758
- Yeah.

318
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,934
- What's wrong?

319
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:36,726
- Hmm?

320
00:24:37,853 --> 00:24:39,854
- You're so tense.

321
00:24:39,855 --> 00:24:40,605
- Hmm?

322
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,899
I don't know.

323
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,944
I guess I'm not used
to being around people.

324
00:24:46,945 --> 00:24:48,362
- Well, that's obvious.

325
00:24:48,363 --> 00:24:50,281
I've been trying to hint
my way under the covers

326
00:24:50,282 --> 00:24:51,491
for five minutes now.

327
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,662
- You are really something.

328
00:25:05,505 --> 00:25:06,839
There's no way that we're
gonna get this guy down to town

329
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,175
without your Jeep.

330
00:25:09,301 --> 00:25:11,218
- We have to do something.

331
00:25:11,219 --> 00:25:12,929
You might have fractured his skull.

332
00:25:13,972 --> 00:25:15,764
- We gotta get him to the dam.

333
00:25:15,765 --> 00:25:17,808
There's usually a ranger there.

334
00:25:17,809 --> 00:25:18,893
- How do we get there?

335
00:25:18,894 --> 00:25:19,853
- On a raft.

336
00:25:22,647 --> 00:25:23,814
- Come on, stop kidding.

337
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:25,024
How do we get there?

338
00:25:25,025 --> 00:25:25,817
- You'll see.

339
00:25:27,027 --> 00:25:29,362
I read my daughter
Huckleberry Finn last summer.

340
00:25:30,447 --> 00:25:33,073
We wanted to light out
for the territories,

341
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,493
so we settled on this as a compromise.

342
00:25:35,494 --> 00:25:36,577
- Looks authentic.

343
00:25:36,578 --> 00:25:39,205
- Yeah, cut all the logs ourselves.

344
00:25:39,206 --> 00:25:40,873
Not a single nail in her.

345
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,042
It's all lashing.

346
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:44,877
- Where's your daughter now?

347
00:25:44,878 --> 00:25:46,755
- Summer camp, other side of the dam.

348
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,591
- Just how sturdy is this thing?

349
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:53,093
- Well, I think it'll hold three people.

350
00:25:53,094 --> 00:25:55,347
Though to tell you the
truth, we never tried it.

351
00:25:56,431 --> 00:25:58,807
My daughter's afraid of the river.

Suzie, honey, don't be scared.

361
00:26:27,254 --> 00:26:30,047
You just have to swim out
to the marker and back.

362
00:26:30,048 --> 00:26:32,300
You've probably swum
twice that far in a pool.

363
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:37,972
Well, if you don't pass your solo swim

364
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:40,766
you can can't get your water badge.

365
00:26:40,767 --> 00:26:41,726
- I don't care.

366
00:26:43,353 --> 00:26:46,146
- Well, what is it that
you're afraid of, honey?

367
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:47,231
- Things.

368
00:26:47,232 --> 00:26:49,192
- You mean like sea monsters?

369
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:53,487
There's just a few little fish in here.

370
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:56,407
They eat plants at the
bottom of the river.

371
00:26:56,408 --> 00:26:57,533
They're not at all interested in

372
00:26:57,534 --> 00:26:59,618
little girl's fingers and toes.

373
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,703
- Dickinson!

374
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:02,122
- Over here, Mr. Dumont!

375
00:27:10,547 --> 00:27:11,923
- Letter for you, Dickinson.

376
00:27:13,008 --> 00:27:13,842
That same boy.

377
00:27:13,842 --> 00:27:14,801
- Oh, thank you!

378
00:27:15,927 --> 00:27:18,971
- Still haven't tackled
your solo swim, Grogan?

379
00:27:18,972 --> 00:27:19,889
- No, sir.

380
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,474
- Oh, she's kind of afraid
of things in the water.

381
00:27:22,475 --> 00:27:23,310
- Things?

382
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:24,144
What things?

383
00:27:24,144 --> 00:27:25,061
Fish?

384
00:27:25,062 --> 00:27:27,814
People eat fish, Grogan,
fish don't eat people.

385
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:31,692
Do you want to be the one to lose

386
00:27:31,693 --> 00:27:33,902
the camp competition for the Minnows?

387
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:34,863
Of course you don't.

388
00:27:36,114 --> 00:27:38,198
- Oh, she's doing really
well in handicrafts.

389
00:27:38,199 --> 00:27:39,825
- Handicrafts?

390
00:27:39,826 --> 00:27:43,162
Handicrafts don't take any
nerve, any intestinal fortitude.

391
00:27:43,163 --> 00:27:44,830
You know what that means, Grogan?

392
00:27:44,831 --> 00:27:46,290
- Yes, sir.

393
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:47,125
Guts.

394
00:27:47,125 --> 00:27:47,959
- Right!

395
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:48,752
- Is there any mail for her?

396
00:27:51,338 --> 00:27:52,630
- Mm, nope.

397
00:27:52,631 --> 00:27:54,132
Skunked again, Grogan.

398
00:27:56,426 --> 00:27:57,218
Grogan!

399
00:27:58,261 --> 00:27:59,012
Guts!

400
00:28:04,184 --> 00:28:04,976
- Oh.

401
00:28:06,019 --> 00:28:07,311
Come on, let's go.

402
00:28:07,312 --> 00:28:08,521
We'll play some Monopoly.

403
00:28:10,273 --> 00:28:12,776
Why don't we try it in an
inner tube tomorrow, huh?

404
00:28:15,111 --> 00:28:15,945
Come on.

405
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:29,291
- Say, Brandy.

406
00:28:29,292 --> 00:28:33,379
Ever tell you about that other
dog of mine called Philip?

407
00:28:35,548 --> 00:28:38,967
Well, Philip, he was in Baltimore with me.

408
00:28:38,968 --> 00:28:40,387
He was a good dog.

409
00:28:41,388 --> 00:28:42,180
He...

410
00:28:46,142 --> 00:28:47,977
He run across the street one day

411
00:28:50,648 --> 00:28:53,941
and he walked right in
front of a trolley car.

412
00:28:53,942 --> 00:28:56,735
Trolley car ran over his
tail, it surprised him.

413
00:28:56,736 --> 00:28:59,530
He turned around and the trolley car,

414
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:00,823
I'm telling you a story!

415
00:29:00,824 --> 00:29:02,534
The trolley car ran over his head.

416
00:29:05,537 --> 00:29:06,371
That's what you call losing your head

417
00:29:06,372 --> 00:29:08,580
over a little piece of tail.

418
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:11,126
Hey, pretty funny, huh?

419
00:29:14,838 --> 00:29:17,005
Well, what's the matter with you?

420
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,468
You didn't like the story?

421
00:29:21,469 --> 00:29:22,636
You want me to tell you another story?

422
00:29:22,637 --> 00:29:24,221
Maybe you didn't get the point.

423
00:29:26,225 --> 00:29:28,767
Are you soft in the head?

424
00:29:43,867 --> 00:29:45,243
- Okay, my friend.

425
00:29:46,286 --> 00:29:49,247
Number one: What happened to those kids?

426
00:29:52,417 --> 00:29:53,877
Alright, then, try number two.

427
00:29:54,961 --> 00:29:57,212
What were you doing up at the Army site?

428
00:29:57,213 --> 00:29:58,547
- Stop that!

429
00:29:58,548 --> 00:30:00,215
- Oh, he speaks.

430
00:30:00,216 --> 00:30:01,009
Hey.

431
00:30:02,051 --> 00:30:03,720
- Keep your hand out of the water.

432
00:30:05,054 --> 00:30:07,139
- What's wrong with the water?

433
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:08,182
- Since you're talking this morning,

434
00:30:08,183 --> 00:30:09,350
buddy, how about a name?

435
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:14,021
- Hoak, Dr. Robert Hoak.

436
00:30:14,022 --> 00:30:15,105
- What's wrong with the water?

437
00:30:15,106 --> 00:30:17,358
- The water is filled
with carnivorous fish.

438
00:30:18,568 --> 00:30:19,360
Piranha.

439
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:23,030
- Oh, Christ.

440
00:30:23,031 --> 00:30:23,823
- In here?

441
00:30:25,450 --> 00:30:26,409
How did they get in?

442
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:28,118
- You let them in when you drained

443
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:30,287
the pond at the test site.

444
00:30:30,288 --> 00:30:31,371
- Paul?

445
00:30:31,372 --> 00:30:32,873
- Piranha are tropical fish.

446
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,625
Look, this is cold mountain water.

447
00:30:34,626 --> 00:30:37,169
They wouldn't last in here for a minute.

448
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:38,505
- What about that skeleton?

449
00:30:42,592 --> 00:30:43,675
- Okay.

450
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:46,971
Well, what would piranha
be doing up in that pond?

451
00:30:48,181 --> 00:30:48,973
Huh?

452
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:52,476
- Untie me.

453
00:30:52,477 --> 00:30:53,269
- Hey.

454
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:57,439
What if I dipped you in the
water a little bit first, Doc?

455
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,234
See if you're making the
whole thing up or not, huh?

456
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:05,198
Brandy!

457
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,784
That's Jack's dog.

458
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:10,328
- Is he always so ferocious?

459
00:31:11,412 --> 00:31:12,412
- You know, I don't think I ever heard him

460
00:31:12,413 --> 00:31:14,957
do more than roll over and beg for food.

461
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,544
We better take a look.

462
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,065
Easy, boy, easy.

463
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:07,217
He must have dragged himself this far.

464
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:08,011
Bled to death.

465
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,893
- I'm sorry.

466
00:32:18,354 --> 00:32:20,105
- Well.

467
00:32:20,106 --> 00:32:21,399
I'll get a shovel.

468
00:32:23,526 --> 00:32:25,361
He wouldn't want to be buried in town.

469
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,170
- Even in an inner tube, huh?

470
00:32:43,171 --> 00:32:44,504
- Uh-huh.

471
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:46,465
- It's almost impossible to fall in.

472
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,634
- But they can still get ya.

473
00:32:48,635 --> 00:32:49,427
- They, huh?

474
00:32:50,762 --> 00:32:51,596
Okay.

475
00:32:51,597 --> 00:32:53,472
Okay, if that's really
the way you feel about it,

476
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:55,557
I'll try and help you get out of the race.

477
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:57,976
But we've got to come up with an excuse.

478
00:32:57,977 --> 00:32:59,937
Do not lie

479
00:32:59,938 --> 00:33:01,480
- I got poison ivy!

480
00:33:01,481 --> 00:33:03,649
- So does everybody else in the camp.

481
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:05,943
Hey, maybe you could
just be getting your...

482
00:33:05,944 --> 00:33:07,945
No, you're too young for that.

483
00:33:07,946 --> 00:33:08,738
- Huh?

484
00:33:09,781 --> 00:33:12,074
- Wait a minute, I have an idea.

485
00:33:12,075 --> 00:33:13,825
Come with me.

486
00:33:13,826 --> 00:33:14,619
Come here.

487
00:33:16,871 --> 00:33:19,164
Come here, sit down here.

488
00:33:19,165 --> 00:33:21,125
Let's see what we have in our magic box.

489
00:33:22,126 --> 00:33:23,461
Alright, give me your knee.

490
00:33:24,796 --> 00:33:25,588
Okay.

491
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:28,882
Get Darlene to take your
place in the race, okay?

492
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:32,552
And if Dumont squawks, limp a lot.

493
00:33:32,553 --> 00:33:34,973
And uh, I'll get you a
huge bandage for this.

494
00:33:39,435 --> 00:33:41,521
- Feels like this thing's
snagged on the bottom.

495
00:33:42,522 --> 00:33:44,107
I got myself tangled in it, too.

496
00:33:44,983 --> 00:33:45,817
- You want me to help?

497
00:33:45,818 --> 00:33:46,942
- No, you better stay there.

498
00:33:46,943 --> 00:33:48,403
You might tip the canoe.

499
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,489
- I thought you knew all
about this kinda fishing.

500
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:53,740
From when you were a boy.

501
00:33:53,741 --> 00:33:55,993
- Listen, when I was a
boy we made our own nets

502
00:33:55,994 --> 00:33:57,036
and made 'em right.

503
00:33:58,705 --> 00:34:01,707
Jesus, feels like
something's snagged in here.

504
00:34:01,708 --> 00:34:02,958
Ow!

505
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:03,876
- Did you get bit?

506
00:34:03,877 --> 00:34:05,002
- Ouch!

507
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:05,837
Ow!

508
00:34:05,838 --> 00:34:07,421
- Dad!

509
00:34:07,422 --> 00:34:08,672
- Stay back!

510
00:34:08,673 --> 00:34:09,923
Stay back!

511
00:34:09,924 --> 00:34:11,466
- Dad, Dad!

512
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:17,514
Dad!

513
00:34:25,898 --> 00:34:27,941
- The government paid you?

514
00:34:27,942 --> 00:34:28,776
- Of course they paid.

515
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:32,821
Whether it's germ warfare,
the bomb, chemical warfare.

516
00:34:32,822 --> 00:34:35,199
There's plenty of money, special agencies.

517
00:34:36,784 --> 00:34:37,744
Oh, no, they pay.

518
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:41,706
They pay a lot better than
they do in private research.

519
00:34:43,166 --> 00:34:44,916
- For raising fish.

520
00:34:44,917 --> 00:34:45,710
- No, no.

521
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:48,171
It's a matter of genetics.

522
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,132
Radiation, selective breeding.

523
00:34:52,759 --> 00:34:55,887
They called it Operation Razorteeth.

524
00:34:58,306 --> 00:34:59,348
- What was it all for?

525
00:35:00,516 --> 00:35:04,227
- To destroy the river systems
of the North Vietnamese.

526
00:35:04,228 --> 00:35:07,689
Our goal was to develop a
strain of this killer fish

527
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:09,733
that could survive in cold water

528
00:35:09,734 --> 00:35:11,652
and then breed at an accelerated rate.

529
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,321
We had everything.

530
00:35:14,322 --> 00:35:15,198
Blank check.

531
00:35:16,115 --> 00:35:18,326
And then the war ended.

532
00:35:19,285 --> 00:35:20,703
- You sound disappointed.

533
00:35:21,746 --> 00:35:22,997
- They poisoned the water.

534
00:35:24,165 --> 00:35:25,208
After all that work.

535
00:35:27,043 --> 00:35:28,211
They poisoned the water.

536
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:30,254
- But some survived.

537
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,464
- We developed a lot of mutants

538
00:35:32,465 --> 00:35:35,634
and a few of them were
able to resist the poison.

539
00:35:35,635 --> 00:35:37,637
They ate their own, their own dead,

540
00:35:38,721 --> 00:35:43,643
and then began to breed
like some wild species.

541
00:35:44,268 --> 00:35:46,771
Suddenly there were
hundreds, maybe thousands.

542
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,815
- Our tax dollars at work, huh?

543
00:35:49,816 --> 00:35:52,609
- Well, that's science in the
service of the defense effort.

544
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:53,902
- Sure.

545
00:35:53,903 --> 00:35:56,738
Spreading strains of bacteria
in the subway system.

546
00:35:56,739 --> 00:35:59,574
- You put them in the river
where they could kill people.

547
00:35:59,575 --> 00:36:00,992
Including civilians!

548
00:36:00,993 --> 00:36:03,829
And little kids swimming in the rivers.

549
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:04,913
- I never killed anybody.

550
00:36:04,914 --> 00:36:06,039
If you want to talk about killing,

551
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,126
you talk to your politicians,
the military people.

552
00:36:09,127 --> 00:36:10,336
No, no, I'm a scientist.

553
00:36:11,712 --> 00:36:12,964
- Kids in the water.

554
00:36:13,881 --> 00:36:15,132
- What?

555
00:36:15,133 --> 00:36:15,925
- The dam.

556
00:36:16,884 --> 00:36:18,009
They let the water through
every couple of days,

557
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:21,096
you know, to keep the level
steady on the new lake.

558
00:36:21,097 --> 00:36:23,265
The resort's down there, the summer camp.

559
00:36:23,266 --> 00:36:24,100
All those kids.

560
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:24,892
Come on!

561
00:36:50,251 --> 00:36:53,628
- Hey, stop splashing!

562
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:55,173
- It was pure research.

563
00:36:56,215 --> 00:36:59,426
No scrounging for grant
money, no academic politics.

564
00:36:59,427 --> 00:37:01,679
You don't know what that
means to a scientist.

565
00:37:02,763 --> 00:37:03,805
- You fed them.

566
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:04,765
You kept them alive.

567
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,643
- I continued the experiment.

568
00:37:08,769 --> 00:37:11,730
There was so much more I
could do with the species.

569
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:13,399
So much further I could take them.

570
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:17,028
You're not holding me responsible?

571
00:37:20,448 --> 00:37:21,282
I think you are.

572
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:24,701
You pulled the plug and
you're holding me responsible?

573
00:37:24,702 --> 00:37:25,494
Incredible.

574
00:37:26,704 --> 00:37:27,747
You're blaming me!

575
00:37:29,248 --> 00:37:30,415
- I think if you open your mouth again

576
00:37:30,416 --> 00:37:32,292
I'll stick this pole in it.

577
00:37:32,293 --> 00:37:35,086
- Do you think they've
opened up the dam yet?

578
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:35,963
- I don't know.

579
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:38,506
We can only hope not.

580
00:37:38,507 --> 00:37:39,634
- Daddy.

581
00:37:41,802 --> 00:37:42,802
Help me!

582
00:37:45,723 --> 00:37:47,600
- Let's move it!

583
00:37:48,935 --> 00:37:50,185
- It's sinking, Paul.

584
00:37:50,186 --> 00:37:51,103
The canoe is sinking.

585
00:37:51,103 --> 00:37:52,021
- Yeah.

586
00:37:58,152 --> 00:37:58,945
- Daddy?

587
00:38:03,074 --> 00:38:03,908
Daddy!

588
00:38:03,909 --> 00:38:05,868
Daddy, it's going under!

589
00:38:06,953 --> 00:38:07,787
- Don't do it!

590
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:10,665
Get outta there!

591
00:38:13,501 --> 00:38:15,126
Come on, Maggie.

592
00:38:55,001 --> 00:38:55,793
- Help!

593
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,089
- Hold it here!

594
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:02,340
Hold it!

595
00:39:11,517 --> 00:39:12,351
- Come on!

596
00:39:12,352 --> 00:39:13,894
Come on, come here!

597
00:39:15,771 --> 00:39:17,898
Come on, come on, come on!

598
00:39:18,816 --> 00:39:20,108
- Get the doctor!

599
00:39:20,109 --> 00:39:21,819
Okay, now the doctor!

600
00:39:43,466 --> 00:39:44,258
Easy, Doc.

601
00:39:46,010 --> 00:39:47,052
Here.

602
00:39:47,053 --> 00:39:48,012
Here you go.

603
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:54,684
What do we do?

604
00:39:54,685 --> 00:39:56,228
How do we stop 'em?

605
00:40:03,486 --> 00:40:04,362
Oh, Christ.

606
00:40:13,330 --> 00:40:14,371
- Campers!

607
00:40:14,372 --> 00:40:15,706
No swinging after lunch!

608
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:45,318
- So far we know that
they can live in cold water.

609
00:40:47,822 --> 00:40:49,573
- They seem to be moving downstream.

610
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:51,991
We've gotta find someone who knows

611
00:40:51,992 --> 00:40:53,326
how to deal with these things.

612
00:40:55,788 --> 00:40:57,789
- There'll be a phone at the dam.

613
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,791
We can call on ahead.

614
00:41:02,294 --> 00:41:03,087
Hey.

615
00:41:04,004 --> 00:41:04,797
- What?

616
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:07,591
- I don't know.

617
00:41:08,676 --> 00:41:12,096
It seems like the lashing's working loose.

618
00:41:18,436 --> 00:41:19,228
- Paul.

619
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:23,189
There's something under us.

620
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:35,453
- Blood.

621
00:41:36,871 --> 00:41:38,746
It's the Doc's blood.

622
00:41:38,747 --> 00:41:40,165
It's seeping through.

623
00:41:40,166 --> 00:41:41,666
They're eating away at
the lashing to get to it.

624
00:41:45,796 --> 00:41:46,630
- Daddy!

625
00:41:46,630 --> 00:41:47,465
- Let go, son.

626
00:41:47,465 --> 00:41:48,299
- But the man!

627
00:41:48,299 --> 00:41:49,133
- No, we gotta get rid of him.

628
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:51,050
- No, that's what happened to my daddy!

629
00:41:51,051 --> 00:41:52,552
- Let go!

630
00:41:52,553 --> 00:41:53,761
- They're eating him.

631
00:41:53,762 --> 00:41:55,722
They're eating him!

632
00:41:59,059 --> 00:41:59,894
- Come here!

633
00:41:59,894 --> 00:42:00,686
- Just like my daddy!

634
00:42:00,687 --> 00:42:02,312
- Come here!

635
00:42:57,535 --> 00:42:58,452
You okay, boy?

636
00:42:59,745 --> 00:43:00,704
How about you?

637
00:43:00,705 --> 00:43:01,705
- I'm alright.

638
00:43:01,706 --> 00:43:03,706
- You gotta stay here.

639
00:43:03,707 --> 00:43:05,458
I'm gonna try to get to the dam

640
00:43:05,459 --> 00:43:07,545
before they let 'em
through with the water.

641
00:43:50,463 --> 00:43:52,088
- Acres and acres of reclaimed land

642
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:54,090
nestled in a scenic mountain valley,

643
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:56,719
site of the newly formed Lost River Lake.

644
00:43:58,387 --> 00:44:01,556
Swimming, sailing, snorkeling,
skin diving, shuffleboard

645
00:44:01,557 --> 00:44:03,808
and for the small fry
there's Buck Gardner's

646
00:44:03,809 --> 00:44:05,436
Aquarena Amusement Arcade.

647
00:44:08,147 --> 00:44:10,648
So pack up your RVs, your station wagons,

648
00:44:10,649 --> 00:44:13,401
your trailers and cars, and hustle on up

649
00:44:13,402 --> 00:44:17,113
to Lost River Campsite for
a free introductory weekend.

650
00:44:17,114 --> 00:44:19,574
No charge, no obligation to buy.

651
00:44:19,575 --> 00:44:21,367
Yes, friends, you can be part of a modern

652
00:44:21,368 --> 00:44:22,911
ecological miracle.

653
00:44:25,164 --> 00:44:26,956
- Don't open it!

654
00:44:26,957 --> 00:44:31,919
Whatever you do, don't open it!

655
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:02,909
- All right, men, off of your butts!

656
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:04,118
Fall in!

657
00:45:04,119 --> 00:45:04,912
Move it!

658
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,088
- You'll forgive
our skepticism, Mr. Grogan,

659
00:45:15,089 --> 00:45:18,091
but we don't come across
stories like yours everyday.

660
00:45:18,092 --> 00:45:19,300
- Piranha are warm water fish.

661
00:45:19,301 --> 00:45:20,760
This is hardly the Amazon.

662
00:45:20,761 --> 00:45:22,637
- But I told you, these are mutations.

663
00:45:22,638 --> 00:45:25,556
They've already killed
five people that I know of.

664
00:45:25,557 --> 00:45:26,600
- Science fiction.

665
00:45:27,851 --> 00:45:29,185
- You ready with that bait, soldier?

666
00:45:29,186 --> 00:45:30,020
- Yes, sir.

667
00:45:30,021 --> 00:45:31,146
- Let her go, son.

668
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:40,071
- Actually, a piranha was caught once

669
00:45:40,072 --> 00:45:43,366
in a pond in Miami in '72, I believe.

670
00:45:43,367 --> 00:45:45,201
But the Fish and Game
Commission poisoned the water

671
00:45:45,202 --> 00:45:46,704
and that, of course, was that.

672
00:45:47,663 --> 00:45:48,955
- That was that, huh?

673
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:50,456
- I mean, the rumors
persisted, you know, but--

674
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:51,542
- Pull it in, son.

675
00:46:02,261 --> 00:46:04,929
Sergeant, tell the Major
to start the pumps.

676
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:08,099
- We should be able to
contain them in this area.

677
00:46:08,100 --> 00:46:09,559
Piranha travel in
schools and we've brought

678
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:12,103
heavy doses of rotenone 235.

679
00:46:12,104 --> 00:46:13,771
- Came pretty well prepared, didn't you?

680
00:46:13,772 --> 00:46:15,398
- Won't it ruin this part of the river?

681
00:46:15,399 --> 00:46:16,983
- Well, sometimes it's
necessary to destroy

682
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:18,025
in order to save.

683
00:46:18,026 --> 00:46:18,944
- Well, what if they realize

684
00:46:18,945 --> 00:46:21,154
they're being slaughtered
and head back upriver?

685
00:46:21,155 --> 00:46:23,698
- We're talking
about fish, Mr. Grogan, fish.

686
00:46:23,699 --> 00:46:25,533
They don't realize much of anything.

687
00:46:25,534 --> 00:46:27,452
- Now, wait a minute, who
are you trying to kid?

688
00:46:27,453 --> 00:46:28,953
You must've known all along
that these things were here

689
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:30,496
or you wouldn't have
brought all this stuff.

690
00:46:30,497 --> 00:46:32,457
- Okay, Mr. Grogan, here it is.

691
00:46:32,458 --> 00:46:33,958
You and Miss McKeown are
the only two civilians

692
00:46:33,959 --> 00:46:36,252
who know about this project.

693
00:46:36,253 --> 00:46:37,545
- What the Colonel really means

694
00:46:37,546 --> 00:46:38,963
is that he'd like you to join us,

695
00:46:38,964 --> 00:46:40,674
become one of our team, as it were.

696
00:46:43,719 --> 00:46:44,511
- It figures.

697
00:46:54,772 --> 00:46:55,898
- Impossible!

698
00:46:57,107 --> 00:46:58,858
- Look, you're a full colonel, right?

699
00:46:58,859 --> 00:47:00,943
I assume you can read a map.

700
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:02,278
Here.

701
00:47:02,279 --> 00:47:03,864
We are here at the dam, okay?

702
00:47:04,782 --> 00:47:05,782
Now, look over here and you'll see

703
00:47:05,783 --> 00:47:08,409
that there's a stream that feeds into it.

704
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:10,411
Okay, we follow the stream back for about

705
00:47:10,412 --> 00:47:12,830
an eighth of a mile and
you see there's a fork.

706
00:47:12,831 --> 00:47:15,541
Take this branch, follow it downstream,

707
00:47:15,542 --> 00:47:17,210
and you'll see it empties into the river

708
00:47:17,211 --> 00:47:18,587
on the other side of the dam.

709
00:47:19,546 --> 00:47:21,464
In other words, the piranha have got a way

710
00:47:21,465 --> 00:47:23,090
to get around the obstacle.

711
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:25,301
- Even if there's a
chance that he's right,

712
00:47:25,302 --> 00:47:27,136
don't you think you should do something?

713
00:47:27,137 --> 00:47:28,013
- No.

714
00:47:28,014 --> 00:47:29,722
Even if a bypass exists,
piranha have neither

715
00:47:29,723 --> 00:47:32,683
the intelligence nor the
motivation to find it.

716
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:34,936
- But you know what Hoak was into.

717
00:47:34,937 --> 00:47:38,189
He was breeding them for
endurance and intelligence and--

718
00:47:38,190 --> 00:47:40,066
- Well, Bob was a dreamer.

719
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:40,901
He, er--

720
00:47:40,901 --> 00:47:41,693
- Bob?

721
00:47:43,570 --> 00:47:44,488
Dr. Hoak?

722
00:47:45,447 --> 00:47:46,281
You knew him?

723
00:47:47,950 --> 00:47:50,369
- Well, fish genetics
is a very small field.

724
00:47:52,037 --> 00:47:52,871
- You were friends?

725
00:47:52,872 --> 00:47:53,955
- But now that
I've seen what they can do

726
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:55,915
it's up to me to stop it
and by God I'm gonna be...

727
00:47:55,916 --> 00:47:58,126
- Let's say were a great
deal more than that.

728
00:48:00,712 --> 00:48:02,422
- You're covering up.

729
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,177
Is it Waxman?

730
00:48:08,428 --> 00:48:10,179
Are you afraid of what the
Army might do to you if you--

731
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,515
- No, I'm not afraid.

732
00:48:12,516 --> 00:48:13,850
I'm a scientist.

733
00:48:13,851 --> 00:48:15,226
I'm head of my department.

734
00:48:15,227 --> 00:48:17,312
It's just that there are priorities and...

735
00:48:20,357 --> 00:48:23,943
Some things are more important
than a few people's lives.

736
00:48:23,944 --> 00:48:26,487
- That's not how Dr. Hoak felt.

737
00:48:26,488 --> 00:48:27,698
Not at the end.

738
00:48:29,157 --> 00:48:30,825
- As I said, he was a dreamer.

739
00:48:30,826 --> 00:48:33,244
- If anything else happens,
it's your responsibility.

740
00:48:33,245 --> 00:48:35,454
- The situation is entirely
under control, Grogan.

741
00:48:35,455 --> 00:48:37,039
- Hold on, now, what is this?

742
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:39,041
Why won't you listen to me?

743
00:48:39,042 --> 00:48:41,169
- Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

744
00:48:43,422 --> 00:48:45,172
As far as you're concerned, Mr. Grogan,

745
00:48:45,173 --> 00:48:46,924
this project does not exist, understand?

746
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,010
The piranha do not exist.

747
00:48:49,011 --> 00:48:49,845
- Mm-hmm.

748
00:48:49,846 --> 00:48:50,928
And if I make a squawk?

749
00:48:50,929 --> 00:48:52,096
- Uh, Paul--

750
00:48:52,097 --> 00:48:53,681
- The interests of national security

751
00:48:53,682 --> 00:48:55,266
permit very extreme measures.

752
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:58,394
- Oh, come on, the war is over, dammit!

753
00:48:58,395 --> 00:49:00,230
- There'll be other wars, Mr. Grogan.

754
00:49:02,065 --> 00:49:03,524
- I think for your own protection

755
00:49:03,525 --> 00:49:06,861
we'd better secure you
a tent for the night.

756
00:49:10,782 --> 00:49:11,866
- Oh, look who's here.

757
00:49:11,867 --> 00:49:13,284
Hey, Tom, what's going on, man?

758
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:14,077
- Nothing.

759
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:25,464
- Psst!

760
00:49:25,465 --> 00:49:26,964
Is he still out there?

761
00:49:26,965 --> 00:49:27,758
- Yep.

762
00:49:28,717 --> 00:49:30,301
- Then you'll have to distract him.

763
00:49:30,302 --> 00:49:31,136
- Why?

764
00:49:31,137 --> 00:49:32,261
- So I can get away.

765
00:49:32,262 --> 00:49:33,554
- So you can get away?
- Shh!

766
00:49:33,555 --> 00:49:34,972
- What about me?

767
00:49:34,973 --> 00:49:36,349
- Alright, suit yourself.

768
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:37,850
But first you're gonna
have to distract him.

769
00:49:37,851 --> 00:49:38,976
- How?

770
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:39,811
- Oh, how would I know?

771
00:49:39,812 --> 00:49:41,520
But just get him with his
back to the opening there.

772
00:49:41,521 --> 00:49:43,273
You know, come on to him.

773
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:49,946
- What if he's gay?

774
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:51,697
- Then I'll distract him.

775
00:49:51,698 --> 00:49:52,491
Let's go.

776
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,412
- Hi.

777
00:49:59,581 --> 00:50:00,374
Uh...

778
00:50:01,792 --> 00:50:02,584
Nice night, huh?

779
00:50:05,128 --> 00:50:07,254
Listen, are you gay?

780
00:50:07,255 --> 00:50:08,673
- What?

781
00:50:08,674 --> 00:50:10,341
- Oh.

782
00:50:10,342 --> 00:50:14,470
Well, I was just reading this
article in this magazine and--

783
00:50:14,471 --> 00:50:16,472
- What did you ask me before?

784
00:50:16,473 --> 00:50:17,391
- Look!

785
00:50:17,392 --> 00:50:18,724
Up in the sky!

786
00:50:18,725 --> 00:50:19,851
It's Superman!

787
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:28,527
- Oh, shit.

788
00:50:29,569 --> 00:50:30,653
- What's wrong?

789
00:50:30,654 --> 00:50:31,946
- Have you got a dime?

790
00:50:43,333 --> 00:50:44,126
- Hello?

791
00:50:45,293 --> 00:50:46,460
What?

792
00:50:46,461 --> 00:50:47,878
What piranhas?

793
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,880
What are you talking about?

794
00:50:49,881 --> 00:50:51,215
What?

795
00:50:51,216 --> 00:50:52,258
Are you crazy?

796
00:50:52,259 --> 00:50:53,051
Who is this?

797
00:50:54,177 --> 00:50:55,595
Oh, Grogan.

798
00:50:56,471 --> 00:50:59,348
Yeah, I remember you, you're
not crazy, you're drunk.

799
00:50:59,349 --> 00:51:00,599
No, I don't want to talk to her,

800
00:51:00,600 --> 00:51:02,310
I'm sure she's as drunk as you are.

801
00:51:03,228 --> 00:51:06,188
You wake me up again I'll
have the cops on you.

802
00:51:06,189 --> 00:51:07,024
What?

803
00:51:07,025 --> 00:51:09,442
No, you can't talk to your daughter.

804
00:51:09,443 --> 00:51:11,194
Sober up, Grogan, and fly right!

805
00:51:17,409 --> 00:51:18,201
Piranhas.

806
00:51:19,828 --> 00:51:20,911
- Asshole.

807
00:51:20,912 --> 00:51:21,954
- He didn't believe you.

808
00:51:21,955 --> 00:51:23,205
- He thinks I'm drunk.

809
00:51:23,206 --> 00:51:25,041
- Well, can you get
through to your daughter?

810
00:51:25,042 --> 00:51:26,625
- No way.

811
00:51:26,626 --> 00:51:28,461
No, we gotta get down there.

812
00:51:56,865 --> 00:51:59,283
- Oh, Paul, behind us.

813
00:51:59,284 --> 00:52:00,701
- I know.

814
00:52:00,702 --> 00:52:03,079
No way we can outrun 'em in this thing.

815
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,080
- Well, maybe we can talk to him.

816
00:52:04,081 --> 00:52:05,957
Maybe he'll believe us.

817
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,959
- Piranha, huh?

818
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:10,294
And where did they come from?

819
00:52:10,295 --> 00:52:13,130
- From an Army test
site up on the mountain.

820
00:52:13,131 --> 00:52:15,716
- That's posted up there,
there's no trespassing.

821
00:52:15,717 --> 00:52:17,885
- Posted or not, two people
have been killed up there

822
00:52:17,886 --> 00:52:19,386
and more have been killed
all along the river.

823
00:52:19,387 --> 00:52:20,888
- Look, you've gotta believe us.

824
00:52:20,889 --> 00:52:22,181
- Now, wait.

825
00:52:22,182 --> 00:52:24,892
Say, aren't you Grogan?

826
00:52:24,893 --> 00:52:25,976
- Yeah, that's right.

827
00:52:25,977 --> 00:52:27,353
- Uh-huh, I remember.

828
00:52:27,354 --> 00:52:30,773
Yeah, we had you in on a drunk
and disorderly last month.

829
00:52:30,774 --> 00:52:32,399
- I am not drunk, dammit!

830
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,360
You give me a breath
test, whatever you want,

831
00:52:34,361 --> 00:52:35,611
only please, would you listen to me?

832
00:52:35,612 --> 00:52:38,197
- Yeah, well, I think I'm gonna
take you up on that, buddy.

833
00:52:38,198 --> 00:52:39,532
Back at the station.

834
00:52:39,533 --> 00:52:40,658
And while we're there, you can explain

835
00:52:40,659 --> 00:52:41,742
what you're doing this time of night

836
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:43,327
in an Army staff car.

837
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:45,579
And don't you get any notions, man.

838
00:52:45,580 --> 00:52:48,207
'Cause I got my gun in my other hand here.

839
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:49,708
Okay?

840
00:52:49,709 --> 00:52:50,919
Okey-dokey, let's go.

841
00:52:57,425 --> 00:52:59,260
- Yes, we've got a bit
of a situation up here.

842
00:52:59,261 --> 00:53:01,345
A very delicate situation.

843
00:53:01,346 --> 00:53:04,223
And you can help us control
it by holding them for us.

844
00:53:04,224 --> 00:53:06,143
- Yes, Colonel, yes, yes, I understand.

845
00:53:07,227 --> 00:53:08,061
Will do.

846
00:53:08,062 --> 00:53:09,854
- And make sure they
don't try to communicate

847
00:53:09,855 --> 00:53:11,188
with the outside.

848
00:53:11,189 --> 00:53:13,774
We're trying to avoid unnecessary panic.

849
00:53:13,775 --> 00:53:14,568
- Certainly.

850
00:53:15,819 --> 00:53:17,779
Their best interests, I agree.

851
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:21,157
Well, you're welcome, Colonel.

852
00:53:21,158 --> 00:53:21,992
Uh...

853
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:28,707
See you in the morning.

854
00:53:40,135 --> 00:53:42,469
Well, you best make
yourself comfortable, folks,

855
00:53:42,470 --> 00:53:43,847
you'll be spending the night.

856
00:53:44,806 --> 00:53:46,182
- What about a phone call?

857
00:53:46,183 --> 00:53:47,017
You have to give us a phone call.

858
00:53:47,018 --> 00:53:48,893
- Listen, I don't want to hear it.

859
00:53:48,894 --> 00:53:50,394
I don't want to hear it.

860
00:53:50,395 --> 00:53:53,397
Now, I gotta get back on that road now.

861
00:53:53,398 --> 00:53:56,984
So you folks, you just behave yourselves.

862
00:53:56,985 --> 00:53:58,027
- Now, wait a minute!

863
00:53:58,028 --> 00:53:59,112
You can't just leave!

864
00:54:00,113 --> 00:54:01,823
My daughter's down there!

865
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:04,868
There are kids down there and
the piranhas are in the river!

866
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:09,371
Please!

867
00:54:09,372 --> 00:54:11,999
- The witch and the demons of the forest

868
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,920
scoured every corner of the church,

869
00:54:15,962 --> 00:54:19,298
venom dripping from their fangs.

870
00:54:19,299 --> 00:54:22,677
"Where is he," hissed the witch.

871
00:54:24,221 --> 00:54:28,642
The demons peeled their
heavy eyelids back.

872
00:54:33,355 --> 00:54:34,355
There he is!

873
00:54:38,443 --> 00:54:40,444
- No, Buck, there's
absolutely no cause for alarm.

874
00:54:40,445 --> 00:54:43,113
It's a complete hoax, believe me.

875
00:54:44,532 --> 00:54:45,658
I just wanted to warn
you in case they were

876
00:54:45,659 --> 00:54:46,952
able to get a call through.

877
00:54:48,871 --> 00:54:50,079
Groundless panic of
that kind wouldn't help

878
00:54:50,080 --> 00:54:52,498
our grand opening any.

879
00:54:52,499 --> 00:54:53,333
- Mm-hmm.

880
00:54:53,334 --> 00:54:55,000
Well, look, I really
appreciate the warning.

881
00:54:55,001 --> 00:54:56,252
I'll brief my staff.

882
00:54:56,253 --> 00:54:57,337
We'll take care of it.

883
00:54:58,296 --> 00:55:01,966
Yeah, don't worry.

884
00:55:01,967 --> 00:55:03,384
Uh-huh.

885
00:55:03,385 --> 00:55:04,803
By the way, you coming down tomorrow?

886
00:55:05,845 --> 00:55:06,680
Oh, good, good!

887
00:55:06,681 --> 00:55:10,057
Your presence will lend a
certain prestige to the opening.

888
00:55:10,058 --> 00:55:12,601
Mm-hmm.

889
00:55:12,602 --> 00:55:13,478
Well, uh...

890
00:55:15,772 --> 00:55:18,608
No, no, Colonel, nobody
knows about your investment.

891
00:55:21,152 --> 00:55:23,779
Colonel, with me a silent
partner's privacy is sacred.

892
00:55:23,780 --> 00:55:26,324
I swear to you on my honor
as a Texan, nobody knows.

893
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:30,703
Yes, Colonel.

894
00:55:30,704 --> 00:55:32,037
Goodnight.

895
00:55:32,038 --> 00:55:33,914
Goodnight.

896
00:55:33,915 --> 00:55:34,749
Schmuck.

897
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:38,252
Hey, come on, you guys!

898
00:55:38,253 --> 00:55:39,087
Will you haul ass?

899
00:55:39,088 --> 00:55:41,047
This stuff's gotta be set by ten o'clock!

900
00:55:42,549 --> 00:55:44,009
What are you doing back there?

901
00:55:45,302 --> 00:55:46,552
Hide, that's all they do, they hide.

902
00:55:46,553 --> 00:55:48,053
They drink beer and they hide.

903
00:55:59,316 --> 00:56:00,900
- Hi.

904
00:56:04,779 --> 00:56:07,156
- I always like it at night.

905
00:56:07,157 --> 00:56:08,033
- Yeah, me too.

906
00:56:08,908 --> 00:56:10,243
It's like it's resting.

907
00:56:11,745 --> 00:56:14,163
- Hey, you wanna race me across?

908
00:56:14,164 --> 00:56:14,998
- What, to the island?

909
00:56:14,998 --> 00:56:15,832
- Yeah.

910
00:56:15,833 --> 00:56:17,124
Ever since I got here I haven't been able

911
00:56:17,125 --> 00:56:18,792
to just swim by myself, you know?

912
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:20,461
I've always had half a dozen campers

913
00:56:20,462 --> 00:56:21,463
hangin' onto me.

914
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:25,507
- I don't know, I don't really
feel much like swimming.

915
00:56:25,508 --> 00:56:27,677
But go ahead, I'll watch you.

916
00:56:29,679 --> 00:56:30,888
- What's the matter?

917
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:32,806
- I don't know.

918
00:56:32,807 --> 00:56:34,768
Something's wrong.

919
00:56:36,644 --> 00:56:37,853
- Come on, why don't you go with me?

920
00:56:37,854 --> 00:56:39,646
It'll do you some good.

921
00:56:39,647 --> 00:56:40,856
- You know, you're probably right.

922
00:56:40,857 --> 00:56:41,899
- Good!

923
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:42,734
Okay, let's do it.

924
00:56:42,735 --> 00:56:43,776
- Okay.

925
00:56:43,777 --> 00:56:45,819
- Grogan, turn off that flashlight!

926
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,947
Don't be alarmed, ladies, it's only me.

927
00:56:48,948 --> 00:56:50,115
There's a rumor some of the campers

928
00:56:50,116 --> 00:56:52,451
are coming down here for midnight swims.

929
00:56:52,452 --> 00:56:53,744
Well, if I catch any of them swimming

930
00:56:53,745 --> 00:56:56,288
they'll be in pretty hot
water, I can tell you.

931
00:56:56,289 --> 00:56:58,499
What are you doing down here, by the way?

932
00:56:58,500 --> 00:56:59,875
- Oh, well, we just--

933
00:56:59,876 --> 00:57:01,835
- I thought I heard some campers swimming.

934
00:57:01,836 --> 00:57:02,670
We came down to look.

935
00:57:02,670 --> 00:57:03,505
- Yeah.
- Swimming?

936
00:57:03,506 --> 00:57:04,922
Where?

937
00:57:04,923 --> 00:57:06,131
- Over by the waterfall.

938
00:57:06,132 --> 00:57:06,966
- The waterfall?

939
00:57:06,966 --> 00:57:07,801
- Yes.

940
00:57:07,802 --> 00:57:09,134
- Is that where they're doing it?

941
00:57:09,969 --> 00:57:10,804
What was that?

942
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:14,681
- Uh, it sounded like campers
on the other side of the lake.

943
00:57:14,682 --> 00:57:17,684
- The other side of the lake?

944
00:57:17,685 --> 00:57:19,812
Thank you.

945
00:57:19,813 --> 00:57:21,188
Kimbrel, is that you?

946
00:57:24,818 --> 00:57:27,986
- Well, there's always
tomorrow for that swim.

947
00:57:27,987 --> 00:57:29,988
- Yeah, let's do it tomorrow.

948
00:57:29,989 --> 00:57:31,533
- Okay.

949
00:57:46,089 --> 00:57:47,214
- What are you doing there?

950
00:57:47,215 --> 00:57:49,883
- Did I ever tell
you about Moe Schneider?

951
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:51,218
- Who's that?

952
00:57:51,219 --> 00:57:54,430
- Well, he was this guy they
sent me to find one time.

953
00:57:54,431 --> 00:57:56,890
He was a plumber and he kept running off

954
00:57:56,891 --> 00:57:59,269
and getting busted for indecent exposure.

955
00:58:04,775 --> 00:58:06,817
- Hey, what are you doing there?

956
00:58:06,818 --> 00:58:08,986
- Moe was in the pokey so many times

957
00:58:08,987 --> 00:58:11,071
that he developed a
regular escape routine.

958
00:58:11,072 --> 00:58:14,283
Of course, being a plumber,
he used what he knew best.

959
00:58:16,953 --> 00:58:18,246
- What the hell was that?

960
00:58:20,498 --> 00:58:21,915
- What are you doing?

961
00:58:21,916 --> 00:58:24,042
Are you all right?

962
00:58:24,043 --> 00:58:25,294
Christ, listen.

963
00:58:25,295 --> 00:58:28,130
This uh, this plan, whatever it is,

964
00:58:28,131 --> 00:58:29,840
did it ever work?

965
00:58:29,841 --> 00:58:32,844
- No, but he came pretty
close a couple of times.

966
00:58:34,512 --> 00:58:36,723
Pretty damn close.

967
00:58:41,019 --> 00:58:42,978
- Baby Jesus, what's all that racket?

968
00:58:42,979 --> 00:58:44,271
Sounds like the roof fell in.

969
00:58:44,272 --> 00:58:46,565
What's all this water from?

970
00:58:46,566 --> 00:58:48,192
- Something's leaking
in here and I'm gonna

971
00:58:48,193 --> 00:58:50,319
catch pneumonia if it doesn't stop.

972
00:58:50,320 --> 00:58:52,321
- What's the matter with that sink trap?

973
00:58:52,322 --> 00:58:55,741
- I've tried and I've tried,
but I'm just not strong enough

974
00:58:55,742 --> 00:58:57,451
to put the pipes back together.

975
00:58:57,452 --> 00:58:59,829
- All right, stand back,
I'll take a look at it.

976
00:59:08,338 --> 00:59:10,339
What the hell'd you do to this thing?

977
00:59:10,340 --> 00:59:12,175
Trying to crawl through the drainpipe?

978
00:59:20,892 --> 00:59:21,726
- What's happening?

979
00:59:21,726 --> 00:59:22,560
What's going on?

980
00:59:22,561 --> 00:59:24,228
- He's knocked out, but he's alive.

981
00:59:24,229 --> 00:59:25,063
- Get his keys!

982
00:59:25,063 --> 00:59:25,855
Can you get his keys?

983
00:59:27,273 --> 00:59:29,525
- They're chained to his pants!

984
00:59:29,526 --> 00:59:31,486
- Well, take his pants off, then.

985
00:59:41,162 --> 00:59:43,372
Come on, come on, I'd have thought

986
00:59:43,373 --> 00:59:46,167
you could get a man's pants
off quicker than that.

987
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:54,424
- Got 'em!

988
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:56,009
I got 'em!

989
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:58,971
- Come on, then, let's go!

990
01:00:00,515 --> 01:00:01,349
What'd you hit him with?

991
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:02,683
- A piece of the toilet lid.

992
01:00:02,684 --> 01:00:03,976
- Oh, Jesus.

993
01:00:03,977 --> 01:00:05,727
- Maybe I should have
tried bribing him first.

994
01:00:05,728 --> 01:00:07,729
- Thank you, Moe Schneider.

995
01:00:07,730 --> 01:00:09,273
You don't suppose that one of those keys

996
01:00:09,274 --> 01:00:11,233
would fit a patrol car?

997
01:00:11,234 --> 01:00:12,652
- I wouldn't be surprised.

998
01:01:01,577 --> 01:01:02,743
- Howdy, folks, I'm Buck Gardner.

999
01:01:04,454 --> 01:01:06,164
Thank you, thank you.

1000
01:01:07,457 --> 01:01:10,042
Thank you.

1001
01:01:10,043 --> 01:01:10,835
Thank you.

1002
01:01:12,462 --> 01:01:14,921
Thank you, I appreciate it.

1003
01:01:14,922 --> 01:01:15,964
Welcome folks on behalf of

1004
01:01:15,965 --> 01:01:19,092
Buck Gardner's Aquarena
Development Corporation,

1005
01:01:19,093 --> 01:01:21,219
it gives me great pleasure
to invite you here

1006
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:24,973
this afternoon to our
opening day festivities.

1007
01:01:24,974 --> 01:01:26,350
Thank you.

1008
01:01:26,351 --> 01:01:27,684
If, during the day, you have any questions

1009
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:29,936
about purchasing land up here,

1010
01:01:29,937 --> 01:01:31,104
our people will be mingling in the crowds

1011
01:01:31,105 --> 01:01:34,024
to answer your questions,
help you out any way they can.

1012
01:01:34,025 --> 01:01:36,652
Just remember you got no
obligation to buy anything,

1013
01:01:36,653 --> 01:01:38,528
only to enjoy yourselves.

1014
01:01:38,529 --> 01:01:39,322
Honey?

1015
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:43,826
Right there.

1016
01:01:44,744 --> 01:01:45,703
Right there.

1017
01:01:46,829 --> 01:01:47,955
Ah, try again.

1018
01:01:49,457 --> 01:01:50,458
Nice try, kid.

1019
01:01:52,168 --> 01:01:53,002
That's it!

1020
01:01:56,422 --> 01:01:59,299
Don't forget, free barbecue
this afternoon at one o'clock!

1021
01:02:00,385 --> 01:02:01,761
Enjoy yourselves.

1022
01:02:03,096 --> 01:02:04,721
We got 'em.

1023
01:02:08,601 --> 01:02:09,394
- No comics!

1024
01:02:10,687 --> 01:02:12,604
No comics, no discipline.

1025
01:02:17,443 --> 01:02:18,902
Water competition, muster up.

1026
01:02:18,903 --> 01:02:20,821
Time for the water competition.

1027
01:02:20,822 --> 01:02:21,781
Put those arrows away.

1028
01:02:21,782 --> 01:02:23,116
Put the bows in the...

1029
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:34,585
That isn't funny, Kimbrel.

1030
01:02:36,170 --> 01:02:38,547
- Okay, Minnows over here.

1031
01:02:38,548 --> 01:02:42,217
Come on, kids, line up.

1032
01:02:42,218 --> 01:02:43,343
Come on, you guys.

1033
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:47,097
- Guppies, come on, let's go!

1034
01:02:47,098 --> 01:02:48,432
Come on, line up, that's right.

1035
01:02:48,433 --> 01:02:49,516
Come on!

1036
01:02:49,517 --> 01:02:50,351
- Okay.

1037
01:02:50,351 --> 01:02:51,227
- Stand in line, straighten up.

1038
01:02:51,228 --> 01:02:52,519
That's right.

1039
01:02:52,520 --> 01:02:53,562
- All the way to the back, there we go.

1040
01:02:53,563 --> 01:02:54,397
- Straighten up!

1041
01:02:54,398 --> 01:02:56,732
- Okay, we're gonna have
the tube race really soon

1042
01:02:56,733 --> 01:02:57,983
and who's gonna win?

1043
01:02:57,984 --> 01:02:58,818
Minnows!

1044
01:02:58,819 --> 01:03:00,777
- We are!

1045
01:03:00,778 --> 01:03:02,779
- We are!

1046
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:03,780
- All right!

1047
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:04,906
Okay, you guys.

1048
01:03:04,907 --> 01:03:07,033
- Now, Jonathan, you cannot
swim with your glasses on,

1049
01:03:07,034 --> 01:03:08,410
you know better than that.

1050
01:03:08,411 --> 01:03:10,412
Let's turn this way, now, buddy system!

1051
01:03:10,413 --> 01:03:11,496
Arms up.

1052
01:03:11,497 --> 01:03:12,748
There we go!

1053
01:03:12,749 --> 01:03:14,166
Stand up straight, come on!

1054
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:15,126
- Stand up straight.

1055
01:03:15,127 --> 01:03:16,753
Come on, be proud, you're a Guppy!

1056
01:03:18,004 --> 01:03:20,213
Hold the stomach in.

1057
01:03:20,214 --> 01:03:21,757
That's good, that's good.

1058
01:03:21,758 --> 01:03:22,592
Hold your stomach in.

1059
01:03:22,593 --> 01:03:23,759
- Good morning, campers.

1060
01:03:23,760 --> 01:03:24,594
Come on.

1061
01:03:24,595 --> 01:03:26,052
Fall in back here and buddy up.

1062
01:03:26,053 --> 01:03:28,555
- Mr. Dumont, we're ready for you, sir.

1063
01:03:31,058 --> 01:03:32,143
- Arms down!

1064
01:03:34,353 --> 01:03:36,354
All right, now, campers,
this is where we're going to

1065
01:03:36,355 --> 01:03:38,231
separate the tortoises from the hares,

1066
01:03:38,232 --> 01:03:42,653
the wheat from the chaff, and
the sinkers from the swimmers.

1067
01:03:44,322 --> 01:03:45,947
- Saltwater.

1068
01:03:45,948 --> 01:03:46,866
- What?

1069
01:03:46,867 --> 01:03:49,075
- I just remembered, it was saltwater.

1070
01:03:49,076 --> 01:03:49,911
- What was?

1071
01:03:49,912 --> 01:03:51,245
- In the pond at the test site.

1072
01:03:52,246 --> 01:03:53,080
I thought it was strange at the time

1073
01:03:53,081 --> 01:03:54,206
and then I forgot about it.

1074
01:03:54,207 --> 01:03:54,999
- So?

1075
01:03:56,042 --> 01:03:57,918
- Well, piranha are freshwater fish.

1076
01:03:57,919 --> 01:04:00,253
That means that Hoak must
have developed a strain

1077
01:04:00,254 --> 01:04:02,297
that can live both in fresh and salt.

1078
01:04:02,298 --> 01:04:03,508
You know, like salmon.

1079
01:04:06,677 --> 01:04:09,179
That's why they're headed downstream.

1080
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:10,764
- And if they get to the ocean?

1081
01:04:10,765 --> 01:04:12,641
- There'll be no way to contain 'em.

1082
01:04:12,642 --> 01:04:13,725
They'll be able to swim up

1083
01:04:13,726 --> 01:04:15,227
every river system in the country.

1084
01:04:41,003 --> 01:04:41,921
- And what are you doing here, young lady?

1085
01:04:41,922 --> 01:04:44,381
You're supposed to be out in that race.

1086
01:04:44,382 --> 01:04:45,465
- But Betsy told me that she--

1087
01:04:45,466 --> 01:04:47,175
- I don't want to hear any excuses.

1088
01:04:47,176 --> 01:04:48,760
Get yourself a tube and get out there.

1089
01:04:48,761 --> 01:04:50,303
- But I hurt my knee and she--

1090
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:51,639
- On the double, camper.

1091
01:05:02,441 --> 01:05:04,651
Listen up, you kids, listen up!

1092
01:05:04,652 --> 01:05:07,445
We're gonna start the
tube race in a minute.

1093
01:05:07,446 --> 01:05:10,240
Kathryn, McCarthy, McBride!

1094
01:05:10,241 --> 01:05:11,658
All you campers come in here!

1095
01:05:11,659 --> 01:05:12,952
You're too far out!

1096
01:05:16,581 --> 01:05:18,541
- Goddamn Sunday driver.

1097
01:05:26,132 --> 01:05:26,924
Hey!

1098
01:05:35,224 --> 01:05:36,017
- Ready!

1099
01:05:52,575 --> 01:05:53,951
Come on, Minnows!

1100
01:05:55,661 --> 01:05:56,745
Come on!

1101
01:05:56,746 --> 01:05:58,623
This is a race, people!

1102
01:06:14,555 --> 01:06:15,764
- Come on!

1103
01:06:15,765 --> 01:06:16,599
Come on!

1104
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,183
We're winning!

1105
01:06:28,027 --> 01:06:30,487
- Jacobson, put a little muscle in it!

1106
01:06:30,488 --> 01:06:32,364
Parkinson, a little effort!

1107
01:06:55,388 --> 01:06:56,222
- Go!

1108
01:06:56,223 --> 01:06:57,598
Come on, come on!

1109
01:07:03,688 --> 01:07:05,730
- Kids, let's get a little leg action!

1110
01:07:15,241 --> 01:07:16,033
- Look!

1111
01:07:20,496 --> 01:07:22,707
- Annie, what's the matter?

1112
01:07:24,291 --> 01:07:25,126
What's going on?

1113
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:47,814
Oh my god, Laura!

1114
01:07:53,904 --> 01:07:55,739
- Get on top of your tubes!

1115
01:07:58,909 --> 01:07:59,869
Go back now!

1116
01:09:08,062 --> 01:09:08,938
- Let me go!

1117
01:09:08,938 --> 01:09:09,730
Let me go!

1118
01:09:53,858 --> 01:09:54,733
- Suzie!

1119
01:09:54,734 --> 01:09:56,067
Suzie, no, go back, go back!

1120
01:09:56,068 --> 01:09:58,445
- Oh, Suzie, get on the boat!

1121
01:10:01,991 --> 01:10:02,825
- Come on!

1122
01:10:02,826 --> 01:10:04,450
- Head back!

1123
01:10:16,130 --> 01:10:16,964
- Ow!

1124
01:10:16,965 --> 01:10:18,173
Ow!

1125
01:10:18,174 --> 01:10:18,966
- Betsy!

1126
01:10:24,889 --> 01:10:26,139
- Betsy!

1127
01:10:50,956 --> 01:10:52,457
- Suzie!

1128
01:10:52,458 --> 01:10:53,250
- Daddy!

1129
01:10:55,336 --> 01:10:56,170
- There's a phone in there.

1130
01:10:56,171 --> 01:10:57,670
You call the resort and warn 'em!

1131
01:10:57,671 --> 01:11:00,089
I'll get those kids out of the water.

1132
01:11:07,056 --> 01:11:08,514
- Operator, get me the number

1133
01:11:08,515 --> 01:11:10,392
of the Aquarena Springs Resort.

1134
01:11:11,977 --> 01:11:13,937
Well, look in the phone
book, in the phone book.

1135
01:11:13,938 --> 01:11:15,438
- Enjoy yourself.

1136
01:11:15,439 --> 01:11:16,398
Enjoy yourself, have a good time.

1137
01:11:16,399 --> 01:11:17,857
Everything's free today.

1138
01:11:17,858 --> 01:11:18,692
Enjoy yourself.

1139
01:11:18,692 --> 01:11:19,485
- Thank you.

1140
01:11:19,486 --> 01:11:21,528
- Keep 'em moving, Terry.

1141
01:11:23,530 --> 01:11:24,448
Wrong way, kid, this is the exit.

1142
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:25,241
Come on.

1143
01:11:29,328 --> 01:11:30,162
Hey, baby.

1144
01:11:30,162 --> 01:11:30,996
- Mr. Gardner!

1145
01:11:30,996 --> 01:11:31,830
Mr. Gardner.

1146
01:11:31,830 --> 01:11:32,665
- What is it?

1147
01:11:32,665 --> 01:11:33,457
- Oh, real important.

1148
01:11:35,542 --> 01:11:36,918
- Buck Gardner.

1149
01:11:36,919 --> 01:11:37,878
- Now, listen to me.

1150
01:11:38,796 --> 01:11:40,005
This is not a crank call.

1151
01:11:41,298 --> 01:11:42,591
I am completely serious.

1152
01:11:44,677 --> 01:11:45,469
- Emergency?

1153
01:11:46,512 --> 01:11:48,012
- Easy, now.

1154
01:11:48,013 --> 01:11:48,847
Easy.

1155
01:11:48,848 --> 01:11:50,349
I got you, I got you.

1156
01:11:51,600 --> 01:11:52,393
All right.

1157
01:11:54,061 --> 01:11:55,478
- Please.

1158
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:58,022
Please, you've gotta believe me.

1159
01:11:58,023 --> 01:11:58,983
- Thank you.

1160
01:11:58,984 --> 01:12:00,483
- Listen to me!

1161
01:12:00,484 --> 01:12:02,068
Look, please, before it's--

1162
01:12:02,069 --> 01:12:03,278
- Thank you.

1163
01:12:03,279 --> 01:12:04,071
Piranha.

1164
01:12:19,378 --> 01:12:20,212
- And they said they're sending

1165
01:12:20,213 --> 01:12:21,337
an ambulance from Gator Springs.

1166
01:12:21,338 --> 01:12:22,547
- We're gonna have to drive
to the resort ourselves.

1167
01:12:22,548 --> 01:12:23,673
- Here, sit down, sit down.

1168
01:12:23,674 --> 01:12:25,174
- Can you handle this?

1169
01:12:25,175 --> 01:12:30,139
- Uh, yeah, I think so.

1170
01:12:36,186 --> 01:12:37,270
- Honey.

1171
01:12:37,271 --> 01:12:40,606
Honey, I'll be back for
you real soon, I promise.

1172
01:12:40,607 --> 01:12:42,108
So you be brave, huh?

1173
01:12:42,109 --> 01:12:42,901
Help out here.

1174
01:12:45,988 --> 01:12:46,780
That's my girl.

1175
01:12:56,290 --> 01:12:58,666
- It's okay, Suzie.

1176
01:12:58,667 --> 01:12:59,793
He'll be back.

1177
01:13:37,122 --> 01:13:38,247
- We got plenty of targets.

1178
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:39,832
Yes, sir, right over there.

1179
01:13:51,595 --> 01:13:53,514
- By the way, sir, they've noticed.

1180
01:13:54,681 --> 01:13:56,808
One woman thought she
recognized the submarine ride

1181
01:13:56,809 --> 01:13:57,768
from somewhere in Florida.

1182
01:13:57,769 --> 01:13:59,060
- Of course she did.

1183
01:13:59,061 --> 01:14:00,853
I picked it up secondhand in Coral Gables.

1184
01:14:00,854 --> 01:14:02,814
Skyway's from Redondo Beach.

1185
01:14:02,815 --> 01:14:04,274
Boathouse is Army surplus.

1186
01:14:05,567 --> 01:14:08,277
Dancing chickens, I got 'em
from a carnival in Idaho.

1187
01:14:08,278 --> 01:14:09,779
Ralph the Swimming Swine?

1188
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,155
He comes all the way from Atlantic City.

1189
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:11,990
- That's just it, sir.

1190
01:14:11,991 --> 01:14:14,534
They're saying for a new resort
nothing's looking very new.

1191
01:14:14,535 --> 01:14:16,077
- Yeah, well, what the hell do they know?

1192
01:14:16,078 --> 01:14:18,955
Ralph the Swimming Swine is
practically a national monument.

1193
01:14:18,956 --> 01:14:20,164
That little porker's been swimming around

1194
01:14:20,165 --> 01:14:22,208
the Steel Pier for more
years than I can remember.

1195
01:14:22,209 --> 01:14:24,127
The rest of the stuff,
they just don't make it!

1196
01:14:24,128 --> 01:14:26,587
I mean, that submarine ride
is a piece of Americana.

1197
01:14:26,588 --> 01:14:28,172
- Yes, sir.

1198
01:14:28,173 --> 01:14:30,133
- Maybe they never heard
of recycling.

1199
01:14:30,134 --> 01:14:31,051
- I don't know, sir.

1200
01:14:31,052 --> 01:14:32,260
- Smile, we're going public.

1201
01:14:32,261 --> 01:14:33,053
Hello, Senator.

1202
01:14:34,763 --> 01:14:35,597
How are you?

1203
01:14:35,597 --> 01:14:36,432
- Hi.

1204
01:14:45,816 --> 01:14:50,779
- If they get to the
media, we're both screwed.

1205
01:14:51,947 --> 01:14:54,949
- Colonel Waxman, Dr. Mengers,
what a pleasant surprise.

1206
01:14:54,950 --> 01:14:56,201
- They busted jail.

1207
01:15:00,956 --> 01:15:02,165
- Look, I know, they already called here.

1208
01:15:02,166 --> 01:15:03,249
- Is your staff ready?

1209
01:15:03,250 --> 01:15:04,333
- They're all set.

1210
01:15:04,334 --> 01:15:05,169
- I think you should
call some of your friends

1211
01:15:05,170 --> 01:15:06,752
in the local newspaper and warn them

1212
01:15:06,753 --> 01:15:08,337
they might be getting some crank calls.

1213
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:09,380
- Wouldn't it be better if
we wait until the calls--

1214
01:15:09,381 --> 01:15:11,799
- You got your orders, mister, hop to it.

1215
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:13,217
- Hey, cool it with the military
crap, will you, Colonel?

1216
01:15:13,218 --> 01:15:14,469
I'll take care of it.

1217
01:15:14,470 --> 01:15:15,511
Whitney?

1218
01:15:15,512 --> 01:15:16,637
- Sir?

1219
01:15:16,638 --> 01:15:17,431
- Let's hop to it.

1220
01:15:22,102 --> 01:15:24,145
- General Waxman, it's been so long.

1221
01:15:24,146 --> 01:15:25,063
- It's Colonel, ma'am.

1222
01:15:25,064 --> 01:15:26,314
- Oh, Colonel still?

1223
01:15:26,315 --> 01:15:28,608
Oh, I can't imagine why.

1224
01:15:28,609 --> 01:15:30,444
- Politics, ma'am, politics.

1225
01:15:34,281 --> 01:15:35,282
Stupid cow.

1226
01:15:49,671 --> 01:15:50,755
- Ready?

1227
01:15:50,756 --> 01:15:53,216
- Okay!

1228
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:29,187
- Hey, he really does ski great!

1229
01:17:34,151 --> 01:17:35,526
He's such a showoff.

1230
01:17:35,527 --> 01:17:37,862
- He thinks he's such hot shit.

1231
01:17:37,863 --> 01:17:40,323
- Maybe we're not going
fast enough for him.

1232
01:17:40,324 --> 01:17:42,575
- I can fix that!

1233
01:18:05,474 --> 01:18:06,308
- Hold it!

1234
01:18:06,309 --> 01:18:07,558
There's something back here!

1235
01:18:10,354 --> 01:18:12,063
Take me in!

1236
01:18:12,064 --> 01:18:12,856
Now!

1237
01:18:14,274 --> 01:18:16,692
- Hey, I think something's wrong.

1238
01:18:16,693 --> 01:18:18,903
- Yeah, we haven't dumped him yet.

1239
01:18:31,792 --> 01:18:32,584
- Stop!

1240
01:18:37,005 --> 01:18:38,422
Take me in!

1241
01:18:38,423 --> 01:18:40,508
There's something out here, come on!

1242
01:18:40,509 --> 01:18:41,550
Get me outta here!

1243
01:18:41,551 --> 01:18:42,469
Come on!

1244
01:18:42,469 --> 01:18:43,345
- Slow down!

1245
01:18:43,345 --> 01:18:44,137
Stop!

1246
01:18:45,889 --> 01:18:46,723
- Faster!

1247
01:18:46,723 --> 01:18:47,599
Don't stop!

1248
01:18:50,060 --> 01:18:51,519
- Wait, he says no.

1249
01:18:54,147 --> 01:18:55,774
Speed up!

1250
01:19:00,362 --> 01:19:01,154
- Stop!

1251
01:20:40,295 --> 01:20:41,129
- Dammit!

1252
01:20:46,426 --> 01:20:48,011
- No, Bob, it's completely false.

1253
01:20:49,554 --> 01:20:51,013
There's not a word of
truth to it, believe me.

1254
01:20:51,014 --> 01:20:52,556
We already talked to the
other newspapers about it.

1255
01:20:52,557 --> 01:20:53,517
- Sir.

1256
01:20:53,518 --> 01:20:55,184
- Excuse me, I'm on the phone.

1257
01:20:55,185 --> 01:20:56,685
- Sir, the piranhas.

1258
01:20:56,686 --> 01:20:58,145
- I thought I told you
not even to say that word!

1259
01:20:58,146 --> 01:20:58,980
- But the piranhas.

1260
01:20:58,981 --> 01:21:00,731
- What about the goddamn piranhas?

1261
01:21:00,732 --> 01:21:02,359
- They're eating the guests, sir.

1262
01:21:08,490 --> 01:21:09,698
- Um.

1263
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:12,076
Uh, Bob, I'm gonna have to
get back to you on this.

1264
01:21:12,077 --> 01:21:14,704
We've got a situation down here.

1265
01:22:03,712 --> 01:22:05,087
- Go on, get off!

1266
01:22:05,088 --> 01:22:05,964
You'll tip us over!

1267
01:22:15,015 --> 01:22:15,807
Get off!

1268
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,573
Dammit, get off!

1269
01:24:16,761 --> 01:24:18,721
- Where are we going?

1270
01:24:18,722 --> 01:24:22,057
- The lake narrows where the
outlet for the refinery was.

1271
01:24:22,058 --> 01:24:25,269
They'll be bunched tight
when they come through there.

1272
01:24:25,270 --> 01:24:26,270
- What then?

1273
01:24:26,271 --> 01:24:27,980
- If it isn't tapped off,

1274
01:24:27,981 --> 01:24:31,358
there might be enough waste
left in the smelting tanks.

1275
01:24:31,359 --> 01:24:32,693
- It'll kill the fish?

1276
01:24:32,694 --> 01:24:34,278
- It'll kill anything.

1277
01:24:34,279 --> 01:24:36,156
We'll pollute the bastards to death!

1278
01:24:46,624 --> 01:24:47,667
Oh, Lord, no.

1279
01:24:51,546 --> 01:24:52,380
- What's wrong?

1280
01:24:52,381 --> 01:24:53,505
- It's all flooded.

1281
01:24:53,506 --> 01:24:55,133
The control booth is underwater.

1282
01:24:56,551 --> 01:24:58,343
- What can we do?

1283
01:24:58,344 --> 01:25:00,637
- Well, we gotta do something.

1284
01:25:00,638 --> 01:25:01,889
Where's that towline?

1285
01:25:01,890 --> 01:25:03,433
- It's in the back.

1286
01:25:08,021 --> 01:25:11,940
- So I want you to start
counting slowly up to 100.

1287
01:25:11,941 --> 01:25:13,817
Then whether I'm up to the surface or not,

1288
01:25:13,818 --> 01:25:17,154
you hit that throttle and
gun this sucker outta here.

1289
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:18,739
If I'm not up by then,
it means I'm in trouble,

1290
01:25:18,740 --> 01:25:20,992
'cause that's as long
as I can hold my breath.

1291
01:25:22,160 --> 01:25:25,913
So, let's count it down together, okay?

1292
01:25:25,914 --> 01:25:27,456
- Okay.

1293
01:25:27,457 --> 01:25:28,249
- One.
- One.

1294
01:25:29,292 --> 01:25:30,542
Two.

1295
01:25:30,543 --> 01:25:31,960
- Three.
- Three.

1296
01:25:31,961 --> 01:25:33,420
- Four.
- Four.

1297
01:25:33,421 --> 01:25:35,047
Five.

1298
01:25:35,048 --> 01:25:37,382
Six.

1299
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:38,176
Seven.

1300
01:26:31,604 --> 01:26:32,397
48, 49.

1301
01:27:33,541 --> 01:27:34,334
63, 64.

1302
01:27:59,651 --> 01:28:00,443
82, 83.

1303
01:28:27,720 --> 01:28:28,596
98, 99.

1304
01:28:30,848 --> 01:28:34,018
One hundred.

1305
01:29:19,605 --> 01:29:20,398
Paul!

1306
01:29:21,858 --> 01:29:23,150
- Lost River Lake.

1307
01:29:23,151 --> 01:29:25,360
Terror, horror, death.

1308
01:29:25,361 --> 01:29:26,154
Film at 11.

1309
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:38,041
- Somebody help!

1310
01:29:57,977 --> 01:29:59,103
- Medic!

1311
01:30:01,814 --> 01:30:02,607
Help!

1312
01:30:08,946 --> 01:30:09,864
- Help her, somebody!

1313
01:30:09,865 --> 01:30:11,239
- Medic!

1314
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:13,116
- Help!

1315
01:30:13,117 --> 01:30:15,077
- Okay, rest now.

1316
01:30:15,078 --> 01:30:16,912
- What the hell are you filming?

1317
01:30:16,913 --> 01:30:19,374
What the hell are you filming?

1318
01:30:28,633 --> 01:30:30,259
- Try and take some.

1319
01:30:32,428 --> 01:30:34,596
- And where do we go
from here, Dr. Mengers?

1320
01:30:34,597 --> 01:30:37,057
- Well, I'm personally
going to head a full scale

1321
01:30:37,058 --> 01:30:38,809
investigation into this incident,

1322
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:40,685
both to discover who is responsible

1323
01:30:40,686 --> 01:30:41,853
and to make absolutely certain that

1324
01:30:41,854 --> 01:30:44,064
nothing like this could
possibly happen again.

1325
01:30:44,065 --> 01:30:45,774
- As an expert in tropical species,

1326
01:30:45,775 --> 01:30:47,818
what danger is there in the possibility

1327
01:30:47,819 --> 01:30:50,195
of the piranha reaching the ocean?

1328
01:30:50,196 --> 01:30:51,030
- Oh, none at all.

1329
01:30:51,031 --> 01:30:52,447
Most of them will have been destroyed

1330
01:30:52,448 --> 01:30:53,490
by pollution at the end of the lake.

1331
01:30:53,491 --> 01:30:55,283
Of course, if any of them did get through,

1332
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:58,745
there's no way they could
survive the saltwater.

1333
01:30:58,746 --> 01:31:01,706
There's nothing left to fear.
