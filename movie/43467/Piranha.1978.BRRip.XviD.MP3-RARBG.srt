1
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:12,504
(Woman) It's got to lead somewhere.

2
00:01:16,716 --> 00:01:20,595
Well, we'll stop and make camp
pretty soon. Got your breath?

3
00:01:22,597 --> 00:01:24,516
Yeah. Let's go.

4
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:35,110
What is this?

5
00:01:38,905 --> 00:01:43,910
It doesn't look like anyone's been here for
a while. Let's go inside and check it out.

6
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:48,206
- Think we should?
- Barbara, who'd know the difference?

7
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:50,417
OK.

8
00:01:55,589 --> 00:01:59,009
Besides, a little lawbreaking'll
do you good.

9
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:14,190
(Barbara) Wonder why this place
wasn't on your map.

10
00:02:14,399 --> 00:02:17,110
(man) Maybe it's
supposed to be a secret.

11
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,321
Maybe.

12
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:23,783
Hey!

13
00:02:25,410 --> 00:02:27,287
Far out!

14
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:42,802
It feels great.

15
00:02:43,386 --> 00:02:47,015
Come on, let's wash off, so it won't
be so funky in that sleeping bag.

16
00:02:47,307 --> 00:02:49,809
What if somebody catches us?

17
00:02:50,101 --> 00:02:52,520
Who's gonna catch us?

18
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,609
There's nobody here.

19
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:02,614
Let's get wet.

20
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:06,618
- Last one in is a rotten egg.
- That's really original.

21
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,082
- Wait a minute.
- What?

22
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,795
What if this is some kind
of a sewage treatment plant?

23
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:19,089
Idiot.

24
00:03:21,716 --> 00:03:24,219
Now you're gonna get it.

25
00:03:27,806 --> 00:03:29,808
How is it?

26
00:03:32,686 --> 00:03:34,604
Here I come.

27
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,780
- That's not funny.
- What?

28
00:03:43,989 --> 00:03:46,992
You bit me. I can't believe
you actually bit me.

29
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,995
What do I look like?
A creature from the black lagoon?

30
00:03:50,287 --> 00:03:53,915
You are paranoid, kid. Listen,
I’ll race you to the deep end.

31
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:17,314
Barbara! There's something in here!

32
00:04:17,814 --> 00:04:19,107
David!

33
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:20,400
God damn!

34
00:04:20,984 --> 00:04:22,694
David!

35
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:32,287
David?

36
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:37,208
David!

37
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,880
David! David!

38
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,595
(Barbara screams)

39
00:04:55,185 --> 00:04:57,103
(screaming)

40
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:29,089
- Rent a Jeep?
- She'll be on unpaved mountain roads...

41
00:07:29,297 --> 00:07:31,716
All right. Where do I sign?

42
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:41,601
We're all set. At Indian Springs you’ll get
a Jeep. The roads are very rough there.

43
00:07:42,018 --> 00:07:43,895
No sweat.

44
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:46,690
- I can handle it.
- I know.

45
00:07:46,982 --> 00:07:49,401
I wouldn’t send you if
I didn't think you could.

46
00:07:49,693 --> 00:07:51,611
Wait. Got ya.

47
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:56,283
- I found the bigamist.
- Right.

48
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,785
- And the bad-cheque lady?
- Right.

49
00:07:58,994 --> 00:08:02,414
- And Mo Schneider.
- Three times, but those were all in town.

50
00:08:02,706 --> 00:08:05,208
You're a city kid.
These kids are out in the boon...

51
00:08:05,417 --> 00:08:08,503
I can find anything, Earl.
I'm two-thirds bloodhound.

52
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:11,298
I told you that when you hired me.

53
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:18,680
Oh, my gosh. My ticket. I could
have sworn I put it in my pocket.

54
00:08:19,014 --> 00:08:20,890
Where's my ticket?

55
00:08:27,105 --> 00:08:28,982
- I can manage it.
- Of course you can.

56
00:08:29,316 --> 00:08:32,110
- It's money in the bank.
- My money.

57
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,807
Hello, Brandy. How are you, huh?

58
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:12,400
This hike from town is
gettin' longer every week.

59
00:09:12,901 --> 00:09:16,404
- You oughta get a car, Jack.
- I got a car.

60
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,908
It's up on blocks. That's where it belongs.

61
00:09:23,912 --> 00:09:25,914
Scotch.

62
00:09:26,915 --> 00:09:28,917
Gin.

63
00:09:30,085 --> 00:09:32,003
Bourbon.

64
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:37,300
(laughs)

65
00:09:38,301 --> 00:09:40,220
Tequila!

66
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,807
You're the 7th Cavalry, Jack.

67
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:46,184
You know, I just ran dry today.

68
00:09:46,518 --> 00:09:49,896
Your corn meal is down there, but
I ain't gonna walk down and get it.

69
00:09:50,313 --> 00:09:52,816
Man cannot live by booze alone.

70
00:09:56,486 --> 00:10:00,115
In lieu of rent. What's up in town?

71
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,703
- Same as usual.
- I bet you miss it, Jack, huh?

72
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:10,000
I bet you miss sellin' whatever
it was. That plastic fruit.

73
00:10:11,084 --> 00:10:13,086
No.

74
00:10:13,712 --> 00:10:15,589
Got the river.

75
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:20,302
It wakes me up in the morning.

76
00:10:23,179 --> 00:10:25,807
Gives me a bath.

77
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:28,101
Does the laundry.

78
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:34,482
Gives me my dinner.
Puts me to sleep real gentle.

79
00:10:35,609 --> 00:10:37,611
I got my river.

80
00:10:38,403 --> 00:10:40,113
I got Brandy.

81
00:10:42,282 --> 00:10:44,200
Paul.

82
00:10:46,995 --> 00:10:49,497
What have you got up here?

83
00:10:50,707 --> 00:10:54,002
I got scotch, gin, bourbon, and tequila.

84
00:10:54,586 --> 00:10:57,088
- What's it to you, anyhow?
- OK.

85
00:10:58,506 --> 00:11:00,800
OK, buddy. I’ll see you.

86
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:03,595
Come on.

87
00:11:04,220 --> 00:11:06,181
Take it easy, Brandy.

88
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:37,796
Ow!

89
00:11:50,016 --> 00:11:51,184
Hm.

90
00:12:05,407 --> 00:12:06,908
(knock at door)

91
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:08,994
It's open.

92
00:12:11,913 --> 00:12:13,790
Paul Grogan?

93
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,920
Hi. I'm Maggie McKeown.
I work for a skip-tracing company.

94
00:12:19,212 --> 00:12:22,090
- What's that?
- We find missing people.

95
00:12:22,591 --> 00:12:25,010
Did my ex-wife send you?

96
00:12:25,302 --> 00:12:27,012
No.

97
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,597
Um...

98
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:31,600
I'm looking for a pair of teenage kids.

99
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:34,519
Some friends said they might
be backpacking up here.

100
00:12:34,686 --> 00:12:38,315
I haven't seen'em. Did you
talk to the sheriff's people?

101
00:12:38,607 --> 00:12:41,484
- They said it was a big mountain.
- They're right. It is.

102
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:48,199
I figured they may have followed the river.
Are there any places to swim near here?

103
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:52,287
Well, if they'd drowned,
they'd be swept down to the dam.

104
00:12:52,621 --> 00:12:55,206
So you're startin' at the wrong end.

105
00:12:55,707 --> 00:12:58,293
Boy, you're the wrong end all right.

106
00:12:59,586 --> 00:13:03,214
Look, am I interrupting something?
This is kind of important.

107
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,300
Hey,

108
00:13:05,508 --> 00:13:07,719
you cool your jets, lady.

109
00:13:08,011 --> 00:13:12,599
I didn't axe-murder your young couple.
I can't help you. I haven't seen'em.

110
00:13:15,602 --> 00:13:17,979
Are there any other shacks up here?

111
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,815
Cabins. This is a cabin.

112
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:25,111
Are there any more of them? Any places
where they might be holed up?

113
00:13:26,696 --> 00:13:30,700
There's an old fella named Jack,
has a place down the river a bit,

114
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:33,119
but he's not with them.

115
00:13:33,411 --> 00:13:37,290
And there was some kind of army
test site way up the mountain.

116
00:13:37,582 --> 00:13:40,919
- That closed down five or six years ago.
- Come on. Let's go.

117
00:13:41,211 --> 00:13:43,797
- Go where?
- You're taking me up there.

118
00:13:45,507 --> 00:13:47,092
Oh, no, I'm not.

119
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,391
You think I'm wasting my time, don't you?

120
00:13:54,599 --> 00:13:57,185
No. I think you're wastin' my time.

121
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:31,803
- Find anything yet?
- Not yet, but it's still early in the day.

122
00:15:12,385 --> 00:15:13,887
David!

123
00:15:15,096 --> 00:15:16,598
Barbara!

124
00:15:29,819 --> 00:15:32,405
- What were they testing here?
- Who knows?

125
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,701
I hiked up here once with my ex-wife.
They had guard dogs out.

126
00:15:37,118 --> 00:15:39,579
The fence was electrified. The works.

127
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:50,006
“BR.” Barbara Randolph.

128
00:15:51,716 --> 00:15:53,593
Hm.

129
00:15:58,682 --> 00:16:00,308
Man, that is cold.

130
00:16:00,517 --> 00:16:03,019
Their parents said they
were excellent swimmers.

131
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:05,981
Wouldn’t they be floatin'
up on top by now?

132
00:16:06,189 --> 00:16:08,692
It takes a while for
the body to bloat with gas.

133
00:16:08,984 --> 00:16:10,986
Nice business you're in.

134
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:13,613
You think there's a way
to pull the plug on this?

135
00:16:21,496 --> 00:16:25,083
- Tropical fish?
- Looks like it's for laboratory rats.

136
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:29,296
You know, where they had to get through
an obstacle course to get a reward.

137
00:16:29,588 --> 00:16:30,589
Hm.

138
00:16:40,307 --> 00:16:42,309
Still warm.

139
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:41,201
Come here. Take a look at this.

140
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,915
Yeuch.

141
00:17:54,089 --> 00:17:58,009
Let's get outta here.
This place gives me the creeps.

142
00:18:13,692 --> 00:18:15,986
Hey! What are you...

143
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:22,617
Well, they've been here all right.

144
00:18:24,703 --> 00:18:27,080
And they never left.

145
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:33,420
- I say we drain the pond.
- Well, now. Now, wait a minute.

146
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:37,799
You can't do that without gettin'
somebody's permission, you know.

147
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:43,013
If it works it's the quickest way
to know if they're down there.

148
00:18:43,179 --> 00:18:45,599
What are you doing?

149
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:04,618
(alarm ringing)

150
00:19:18,214 --> 00:19:20,508
Are you all right?

151
00:19:25,889 --> 00:19:27,807
- He's breathing.
- No thanks to you.

152
00:19:28,099 --> 00:19:32,103
- What was I supposed to do?
- I would have got loose in a second.

153
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:36,691
- Look at this. You put a dent in it.
- Could I have a sip of that, please?

154
00:19:38,109 --> 00:19:40,111
It's not water.

155
00:19:50,288 --> 00:19:52,999
- What is it?
- The water's salty.

156
00:19:57,295 --> 00:19:58,713
Where does this drain to?

157
00:19:58,797 --> 00:20:01,216
It was a fish hatchery
before the army took it over.

158
00:20:01,508 --> 00:20:04,386
It probably drains
underground into the river.

159
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,388
Uh-oh.

160
00:20:13,311 --> 00:20:18,817
I think it's a dog. I don't suppose
they would have fit through here.

161
00:20:19,317 --> 00:20:21,611
Not in one piece.

162
00:20:23,488 --> 00:20:25,699
You think he's all right up there?

163
00:20:26,116 --> 00:20:27,993
(engine)

164
00:20:28,702 --> 00:20:30,412
Oh, shit.

165
00:20:33,915 --> 00:20:35,500
Oh, my God.

166
00:20:41,006 --> 00:20:43,592
(engine noise fades)

167
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:49,889
I guess I must have left
the keys in it. Huh?

168
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:31,806
- He's alive.
- He's indestructible.

169
00:21:32,891 --> 00:21:34,309
(shouts)

170
00:21:34,601 --> 00:21:37,103
Easy. Easy, now. Easy. Easy.

171
00:21:38,313 --> 00:21:41,107
- Razorteeth.
- What's “razorteeth”?

172
00:21:41,316 --> 00:21:42,901
- You drained the pond?
- Yes...

173
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,111
- You let them out?
- Let who out?

174
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,988
What's he doin'?

175
00:21:47,197 --> 00:21:49,783
You don't know what
you've done. Untie me.

176
00:21:50,617 --> 00:21:53,286
The question is, what you've done, mister.

177
00:21:53,495 --> 00:21:55,497
You don't know.

178
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:59,292
They breed like flies.
There'll be no way to stop them.

179
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:02,712
Would you talk sense, dammit?
What about those kids?

180
00:22:03,004 --> 00:22:06,800
I can't tell you. Mother of God,
they’ll kill us. They’ll kill all of us.

181
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:10,887
OK, mister, listen. They're gonna
sweat it out of you in town.

182
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:14,099
They’ll kill us.

183
00:22:14,391 --> 00:22:16,810
What have we done?

184
00:22:29,406 --> 00:22:31,408
Oh, my God.

185
00:22:43,587 --> 00:22:46,881
- He thinks someone's going to kill him.
- He's right.

186
00:22:47,215 --> 00:22:49,718
I am, if he steps out of line.

187
00:22:50,802 --> 00:22:53,179
- Do you have any cigarettes?
- No.

188
00:22:53,513 --> 00:22:56,182
I quit a year ago.
It interfered with my drinking.

189
00:22:57,809 --> 00:23:00,395
Do you mind if I come in for a minute?

190
00:23:01,104 --> 00:23:02,981
Sure.

191
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:11,489
So, did you start drinking before or after?

192
00:23:11,698 --> 00:23:14,910
- Before or after what?
- Your wife left you.

193
00:23:16,202 --> 00:23:21,499
- What the hell kind of question is that?
- Look, I'm sorry. I was just interested.

194
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:27,881
Um,

195
00:23:28,214 --> 00:23:30,717
do you mind if I sit here?

196
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,720
Go ahead.

197
00:23:40,393 --> 00:23:43,188
- How long were you married?
- Huh?

198
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:45,315
Um,

199
00:23:45,482 --> 00:23:47,609
ten years.

200
00:23:47,817 --> 00:23:51,196
She was just 17 when we
eloped in her father's car.

201
00:23:52,781 --> 00:23:55,700
Man, we thought we had
the world by the balls.

202
00:24:00,413 --> 00:24:02,415
Where did you live?

203
00:24:02,582 --> 00:24:06,920
In town. I worked in
a smeltin' operation downriver.

204
00:24:07,212 --> 00:24:10,298
The government closed us down.
Said we killed too many fish.

205
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:15,011
They gave it to the army, and the
army sold it to some resort outfit.

206
00:24:15,804 --> 00:24:19,599
So you know that somebody's makin'
bundles somewhere along the line.

207
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:22,185
How do you make a living now?

208
00:24:22,519 --> 00:24:24,813
Back pay. Unemployment.

209
00:24:25,188 --> 00:24:27,482
Gonna have to go to work
come September.

210
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,611
Keep my daughter in saddle shoes.

211
00:24:32,988 --> 00:24:35,991
- Does your daughter live with you?
- Yeah.

212
00:24:43,707 --> 00:24:45,584
- What's wrong?
- Hm?

213
00:24:46,793 --> 00:24:49,212
- You're so tense.
- Hm?

214
00:24:50,797 --> 00:24:54,718
I don't know. I guess I'm not
used to bein' around people.

215
00:24:56,595 --> 00:25:01,391
That's obvious. I've been trying to hint
my way under the covers for five minutes.

216
00:25:03,393 --> 00:25:05,896
(Paul) You are really somethin'.

217
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:18,116
(Paul) There's no way we're gonna get
this guy down to town without your Jeep.

218
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:21,786
We have to do something.
He might have fractured his skull.

219
00:25:22,704 --> 00:25:26,499
We gotta get him to the dam.
There's usually a ranger there.

220
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:29,586
- How do we get there?
- On a raft.

221
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,716
- Stop kidding. How do we get there?
- You’ll see.

222
00:25:36,384 --> 00:25:39,095
I read my daughter
Huckleberry Finn last summer.

223
00:25:39,304 --> 00:25:44,184
We wanted to light out for the territories
so we settled on this as a compromise.

224
00:25:44,517 --> 00:25:47,896
- It looks authentic.
- Yeah. We cut all the logs ourselves.

225
00:25:48,313 --> 00:25:50,815
Not a single nail in her. It's all lashing.

226
00:25:52,317 --> 00:25:56,488
- Where's your daughter now?
- Summer camp, other side of the dam.

227
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:59,199
Just how sturdy is this thing?

228
00:25:59,491 --> 00:26:01,785
I think it’ll hold three people.

229
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:06,790
To tell you the truth, we never tried it.
My daughter's afraid of the river.

230
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:11,711
(girls singing)  Boys are made
of greasy grimy gopher guts

231
00:26:12,003 --> 00:26:13,880
Mutilated monkey meat

232
00:26:14,089 --> 00:26:15,882
Little dirty birdie feet

233
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:18,218
Sneezed-up snail snot

234
00:26:18,385 --> 00:26:20,387
Bashed-in beetles' brains

235
00:26:20,595 --> 00:26:23,682
All in a bottle of blood

236
00:26:32,190 --> 00:26:35,193
Suzie? Suzie, honey, don't be scared.

237
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:38,780
You just have to swim out
to the marker and back.

238
00:26:39,114 --> 00:26:41,908
You've probably swum
twice that far in a pool.

239
00:26:45,203 --> 00:26:49,291
If you don't pass your solo swim
you can't get your water badge.

240
00:26:49,583 --> 00:26:51,585
I don't care.

241
00:26:52,419 --> 00:26:55,088
What is it that you're afraid of, honey?

242
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,008
- Things.
- You mean like sea monsters?

243
00:26:59,884 --> 00:27:02,304
There's just a few little fish in here.

244
00:27:02,512 --> 00:27:05,181
They eat plants at the bottom of the river.

245
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,393
They're not interested
in little girls' fingers and toes.

246
00:27:08,685 --> 00:27:11,313
- Dickinson!
- Over here, Mr. Dumont.

247
00:27:19,613 --> 00:27:22,490
Letter for you, Dickinson. That same boy.

248
00:27:22,782 --> 00:27:24,701
Oh, thank you.

249
00:27:25,201 --> 00:27:27,495
Still haven't tackled
your solo swim, Grogan?

250
00:27:27,704 --> 00:27:28,705
No, sir.

251
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:31,291
She's kind of afraid of things in the water.

252
00:27:31,499 --> 00:27:37,005
Things? What things? Fish? People eat
fish, Grogan. Fish don't eat people.

253
00:27:38,882 --> 00:27:42,719
Do you wanna be the one to lose the
camp competition for the Minnows?

254
00:27:43,011 --> 00:27:44,596
Course you don't.

255
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:50,310
- She's doing really well on handicrafts.
- Handicrafts don't take any nerve.

256
00:27:50,685 --> 00:27:53,688
Any intestinal fortitude.
You know what that means, Grogan?

257
00:27:53,897 --> 00:27:56,191
- Yes, sir. Guts.
- Right.

258
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,985
Is there any mail for her?

259
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,281
Nope. Skunked again, Grogan.

260
00:28:05,492 --> 00:28:07,118
Grogan.

261
00:28:07,285 --> 00:28:09,412
Guts.

262
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:14,793
Uh...

263
00:28:15,085 --> 00:28:18,088
Come on, let’s go.
We’ll play some Monopoly.

264
00:28:19,214 --> 00:28:22,592
Why don't we try it in
an inner tube tomorrow? Huh?

265
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:25,804
Come on.

266
00:28:36,106 --> 00:28:37,983
Hey, Brandy.

267
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:42,487
Did I ever tell you about that
other dog of mine called Philip?

268
00:28:44,406 --> 00:28:46,992
Philip grew up in Baltimore with me.

269
00:28:47,784 --> 00:28:49,995
He was a good dog.

270
00:28:50,287 --> 00:28:51,705
He...

271
00:28:55,208 --> 00:28:57,794
He run across the street one day,

272
00:28:59,212 --> 00:29:02,716
and he walked right
in front of a trolley car.

273
00:29:02,882 --> 00:29:05,302
It ran over his tail. It surprised him.

274
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:08,388
He turned around and the trolley car...

275
00:29:08,597 --> 00:29:12,100
I'm tellin' you a story. The
trolley car ran over his head.

276
00:29:14,394 --> 00:29:19,399
It's what you call losin' your head over
a little piece of tail. Pretty funny, huh?

277
00:29:20,901 --> 00:29:21,985
(laughs)

278
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:23,695
(dog Whines)

279
00:29:23,904 --> 00:29:26,489
What's the matter with you?

280
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,913
You didn't like the story? Want me
to tell another? Maybe you didn't get it.

281
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:34,706
(dog Whines)

282
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:37,500
Are you soft in the head?

283
00:29:52,891 --> 00:29:55,101
OK, my friend.

284
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:58,104
Number one:
what happened to those kids?

285
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:05,904
All right, then, try number two: what
were you doin' up at the army site?

286
00:30:06,196 --> 00:30:08,615
- Stop that!
- Oh, he speaks.

287
00:30:09,282 --> 00:30:10,408
Hey.

288
00:30:11,117 --> 00:30:15,497
- Keep your hand out of the water.
- What's wrong with the water?

289
00:30:16,081 --> 00:30:19,584
Since you're talkin' this morning,
buddy, how about a name?

290
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,504
Hoak. Dr Robert Hoak.

291
00:30:22,796 --> 00:30:27,300
- What's wrong with the water?
- The water is filled with carnivorous fish.

292
00:30:27,592 --> 00:30:29,511
Piranha.

293
00:30:30,095 --> 00:30:31,388
(Paul) Oh, Christ.

294
00:30:32,097 --> 00:30:35,308
In here? How did they get in?

295
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:38,812
You let them in when you drained
the pond at the test site.

296
00:30:39,104 --> 00:30:41,606
- Paul...
- Piranha are tropical fish.

297
00:30:41,898 --> 00:30:45,485
This is cold mountain water. They
wouldn’t last in here for a minute.

298
00:30:45,986 --> 00:30:48,697
What about that skeleton?

299
00:30:51,616 --> 00:30:55,120
OK. What would piranha
be doin' up in that pond?

300
00:30:57,414 --> 00:30:59,291
Huh?

301
00:30:59,708 --> 00:31:02,210
- Untie me.
- Hey...

302
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:06,214
What if I dipped you in
the water a little bit first, Doc?

303
00:31:06,506 --> 00:31:09,801
See if you're makin'
the whole thing up or not. Huh?

304
00:31:10,093 --> 00:31:11,511
(dog barking)

305
00:31:13,305 --> 00:31:15,307
Brandy.

306
00:31:15,599 --> 00:31:17,601
That's Jack's dog.

307
00:31:17,893 --> 00:31:19,811
Is he always so ferocious?

308
00:31:20,312 --> 00:31:24,983
(Paul) I don't think I ever heard him do
more than roll over and beg for food.

309
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,903
We'd better take a look.

310
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:38,997
(dog Whines)

311
00:31:46,713 --> 00:31:48,590
Easy, boy. Easy.

312
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:16,910
He must have dragged himself
this far. Bled to death.

313
00:32:23,083 --> 00:32:25,001
I'm sorry.

314
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:31,383
I’ll get a shovel.

315
00:32:32,509 --> 00:32:35,095
He wouldn’t wanna be buried in town.

316
00:32:49,901 --> 00:32:52,487
- Even in an inner tube, huh?
- Uh-huh.

317
00:32:53,488 --> 00:32:57,409
- It's almost impossible to fall in.
- But they can still get you.

318
00:32:57,701 --> 00:32:59,494
They, huh?

319
00:32:59,619 --> 00:33:04,207
OK. If that's really the way you feel about
it, I’ll try and help you get out of the race.

320
00:33:04,499 --> 00:33:08,420
But we've got to come up
with an excuse. Do not lie.

321
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:12,299
- I got poison ivy.
- So does everybody else in the camp.

322
00:33:12,716 --> 00:33:16,511
Hey, maybe you could just be getting
your... No, you're too young for that.

323
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,680
Huh?

324
00:33:18,805 --> 00:33:21,516
Wait a minute. I have an idea.
Come with me.

325
00:33:25,312 --> 00:33:27,814
Come here. Sit down here.

326
00:33:28,398 --> 00:33:32,193
Let's see what we have in our
magic box. Give me your knee.

327
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:37,699
OK. Get Darlene to take
your place in the race. OK?

328
00:33:38,199 --> 00:33:40,702
And if Dumont squawks, limp a lot.

329
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,289
And, uh, I’ll get you
a huge bandage for this.

330
00:33:48,209 --> 00:33:51,004
Feels like this thing's
snagged on the bottom.

331
00:33:51,296 --> 00:33:54,507
- Got myself tangled in it too.
- Want me to help?

332
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:57,802
No, you better stay there.
You might tip the canoe.

333
00:33:58,011 --> 00:34:02,390
I thought you knew all about this kind
of fishing, from when you were a boy.

334
00:34:02,807 --> 00:34:06,603
Listen, when I was a boy we made
our own nets and made 'em right.

335
00:34:07,395 --> 00:34:10,982
Jesus. It feels like
something's snagged in here. Ow!

336
00:34:11,608 --> 00:34:13,693
- Did you get bit?
- Ouch!

337
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:16,112
- Ow!
- Dad!

338
00:34:16,279 --> 00:34:19,491
- Stay back! Stay back!
- Dad! Dad!

339
00:34:30,085 --> 00:34:31,211
Dad!

340
00:34:34,798 --> 00:34:37,300
- The government paid you?
- Of course they paid.

341
00:34:37,717 --> 00:34:41,012
Where there's germ warfare,
the bomb, chemical warfare,

342
00:34:41,888 --> 00:34:44,599
there's plenty of money.
Special agencies.

343
00:34:46,184 --> 00:34:50,480
They pay. They pay a lot better
than they do in private research.

344
00:34:51,398 --> 00:34:53,191
For raisin' fish.

345
00:34:54,317 --> 00:34:56,903
Oh, no. It's a matter of genetics.

346
00:34:58,488 --> 00:35:00,991
Radiation. Selective breeding.

347
00:35:01,908 --> 00:35:04,995
They called it Operation Razorteeth.

348
00:35:07,414 --> 00:35:09,291
What was it all for?

349
00:35:09,583 --> 00:35:13,003
To destroy the river systems
of the North Vietnamese.

350
00:35:13,295 --> 00:35:18,383
Our goal was to develop a strain of this
killer fish that could survive in cold water

351
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,011
and then breed at an accelerated rate.

352
00:35:22,095 --> 00:35:24,681
We had everything. Blank cheque.

353
00:35:25,181 --> 00:35:27,809
And then the war ended.

354
00:35:28,310 --> 00:35:30,186
You sound disappointed.

355
00:35:30,812 --> 00:35:32,898
They poisoned the water.

356
00:35:33,189 --> 00:35:37,319
After all that work,
they poisoned the water.

357
00:35:37,986 --> 00:35:39,988
But some survived.

358
00:35:40,196 --> 00:35:44,284
We developed a lot of mutants and a few
of them were able to resist the poison.

359
00:35:44,701 --> 00:35:47,495
They ate their own. Their own dead.

360
00:35:47,704 --> 00:35:52,417
And then began to breed
like some wild species.

361
00:35:53,418 --> 00:35:56,296
Suddenly there were hundreds.
Maybe thousands.

362
00:35:57,005 --> 00:36:01,301
- Our tax dollars at work, huh?
- That's science in the service of defense.

363
00:36:01,718 --> 00:36:05,513
Sure. Spreadin' strains
of bacteria in the subway system.

364
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:10,101
You put them in the river where they
could kill people. Including civilians.

365
00:36:10,602 --> 00:36:13,688
- And kids swimming in the rivers.
- I never killed anybody.

366
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:17,692
If you wanna talk about killing,
talk to your politicians, the military.

367
00:36:17,984 --> 00:36:20,111
No, no. I'm a scientist.

368
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,406
- Kids in the water.
- What?

369
00:36:24,199 --> 00:36:25,492
The dam.

370
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,579
They let water through every few days
to keep the level steady on the new lake.

371
00:36:29,913 --> 00:36:34,417
The resort's down there. Summer camp.
All those kids. Come on.

372
00:36:37,087 --> 00:36:39,005
(children scream)

373
00:36:58,692 --> 00:37:00,694
(boy) Hey, stop splashin'!

374
00:37:02,904 --> 00:37:06,783
It was pure research.
No scrounging for grant money.

375
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:10,495
No academic politics. You don't know
what that means to a scientist.

376
00:37:11,705 --> 00:37:14,291
You fed them. You kept them alive.

377
00:37:15,292 --> 00:37:17,502
I continued the experiment.

378
00:37:17,794 --> 00:37:20,505
There was so much more
I could do with the species.

379
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,383
So much further I could take them.

380
00:37:24,384 --> 00:37:27,304
You're not holding me responsible?

381
00:37:29,514 --> 00:37:34,394
I think you are. You pulled the plug and
you're holding me responsible. Incredible.

382
00:37:35,812 --> 00:37:37,480
You're blaming me.

383
00:37:38,398 --> 00:37:41,484
I think if you open your mouth again
I’ll stick this pole in it.

384
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:46,197
- You think they've opened the dam yet?
- I don't know. We can only hope not.

385
00:37:47,198 --> 00:37:49,200
(boy) Daddy.

386
00:37:54,497 --> 00:37:57,083
(Paul) Let's move it.

387
00:37:57,417 --> 00:38:00,295
- It's sinking, Paul. The canoe is sinking.
- Yeah.

388
00:38:06,801 --> 00:38:08,803
Daddy?

389
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:14,309
Daddy! Daddy! It's going under.

390
00:38:15,810 --> 00:38:18,688
(Paul) Don't do it! Get outta there!

391
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,402
Come on, Maggie.

392
00:38:53,306 --> 00:38:54,599
(Hoak yells)

393
00:39:08,989 --> 00:39:10,490
Hold it here. Hold it.

394
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,294
(Maggie) Come on! Come on! Come here!

395
00:39:24,296 --> 00:39:27,007
Come on! Give me your hand.

396
00:39:27,299 --> 00:39:29,593
Get the doctor. OK, now the doctor.

397
00:39:52,407 --> 00:39:54,284
Easy, Doc.

398
00:39:54,910 --> 00:39:57,203
Here. Here you go.

399
00:40:00,206 --> 00:40:04,419
What do we do? What do we do?
How do we stop them?

400
00:40:12,302 --> 00:40:13,720
Oh, Christ.

401
00:40:21,519 --> 00:40:22,187
(Whistle)

402
00:40:22,312 --> 00:40:24,689
Campers. No swinging after lunch.

403
00:40:51,299 --> 00:40:54,094
(Paul) So far we know that they
can live in cold water.

404
00:40:56,805 --> 00:40:59,391
(Maggie) They seem to be
moving downstream.

405
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:03,603
Gotta find someone who knows
how to deal with these things.

406
00:41:04,688 --> 00:41:07,607
There’ll be a phone at the dam.
We can call on ahead.

407
00:41:11,194 --> 00:41:13,613
- Hey.
- What?

408
00:41:15,282 --> 00:41:19,786
I don't know. It seems like
the lashing's workin' loose.

409
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:30,297
Paul... there's something under us.

410
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:46,313
His blood. It's the doc's blood.

411
00:41:47,606 --> 00:41:51,484
It's seepin' through. They're eatin'
away at the lashing to get to it.

412
00:41:54,487 --> 00:41:57,115
- Daddy!
- Let go, son. No. We gotta get rid of him.

413
00:41:57,407 --> 00:41:59,784
No. That's what happened to my daddy.

414
00:41:59,993 --> 00:42:02,287
- (Maggie) Let go.
- (boy) They're eating him.

415
00:42:02,704 --> 00:42:04,915
They're eating him!

416
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:11,004
- Come here.
- They got my daddy!

417
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:09,104
You OK, boy? How about you?

418
00:43:09,312 --> 00:43:12,315
- I'm all right.
- You gotta stay here.

419
00:43:12,691 --> 00:43:16,695
I'm gonna try to get to the dam before
they let 'em through with the water.

420
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:27,289
(air horn)

421
00:43:35,088 --> 00:43:37,007
(air horn continues)

422
00:43:59,112 --> 00:44:02,908
(TV) Acres and acres of reclaimed land
nestled in a scenic mountain valley,

423
00:44:03,283 --> 00:44:05,619
site of the newly formed Lost River Lake.

424
00:44:07,495 --> 00:44:10,707
Swimming, sailing, snorkeling,
skin diving, shuffleboard,

425
00:44:11,082 --> 00:44:14,294
and Buck Gardner's
Aquarena Amusement Arcade.

426
00:44:17,213 --> 00:44:20,884
So pack up your RVs, your station
Wagons, your trailers and cars,

427
00:44:21,218 --> 00:44:25,513
and hustle on up to Lost River Campsite
for a free introductory Weekend.

428
00:44:34,105 --> 00:44:37,817
Don't open it!
Whatever you do, don't open it.

429
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:13,311
(man) All right, men, off your butts.
Fall in. Move it!

430
00:45:22,612 --> 00:45:26,491
Forgive our skepticism, but we don't
come across stories like yours every day.

431
00:45:26,908 --> 00:45:29,703
Piranha are warm-water fish.
This is hardly the Amazon.

432
00:45:29,911 --> 00:45:34,416
But I told you, these are mutations.
They've already killed five people.

433
00:45:34,708 --> 00:45:38,003
- Science fiction.
- You ready with that bait, soldier?

434
00:45:38,295 --> 00:45:40,797
- Yes, sir.
- Let her go, son.

435
00:45:47,596 --> 00:45:52,183
Actually, a piranha was caught once
in a pond in Miami, in '72, I believe.

436
00:45:52,517 --> 00:45:55,896
But the Fish and Game Commission
poisoned the water, and that was that.

437
00:45:56,313 --> 00:45:59,691
- That was that, huh?
- The rumors persisted, you know, but...

438
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:02,319
Pull it in, son.

439
00:46:11,286 --> 00:46:13,788
Sergeant, tell the major
to start the pumps.

440
00:46:13,997 --> 00:46:16,583
We should be able to
contain them in this area.

441
00:46:16,791 --> 00:46:20,921
Piranha travel in schools, and we've
brought heavy doses of rotenone 235.

442
00:46:21,296 --> 00:46:24,299
- Came well-prepared, didn't you?
- Won't it ruin the river?

443
00:46:24,591 --> 00:46:26,718
Sometimes you need to destroy
in order to save.

444
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:29,888
What if they realize they're
bein' slaughtered and leave?

445
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,390
We're talking about fish, Mr. Grogan.

446
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:36,311
- They don't realize much of anything.
- Who are you trying to kid?

447
00:46:36,603 --> 00:46:39,397
You must've known
all along they were here.

448
00:46:39,689 --> 00:46:44,402
OK. You and Miss McKeown are the only
two civilians who know about this project.

449
00:46:45,111 --> 00:46:50,283
What the colonel means is that he'd like
you to join us. Become one of our team.

450
00:46:52,911 --> 00:46:54,788
It figures.

451
00:47:04,005 --> 00:47:05,215
Impossible.

452
00:47:06,299 --> 00:47:10,887
Look, you're a full colonel, right?
I assume you can read a map. Here.

453
00:47:11,513 --> 00:47:13,515
We are here at the dam, OK?

454
00:47:13,682 --> 00:47:17,018
Over here you’ll see there's
a stream that feeds into it.

455
00:47:17,394 --> 00:47:21,690
Follow the stream back for an eighth
of a mile and you see there's a fork.

456
00:47:21,982 --> 00:47:24,484
Take this branch, follow it downstream,

457
00:47:24,693 --> 00:47:28,405
and you’ll see it empties into the
river on the other side of the dam.

458
00:47:28,697 --> 00:47:31,992
In other words, the piranha have
a way to get around the obstacle.

459
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:35,996
Even if there's a chance he's right,
don't you think you should do something?

460
00:47:36,413 --> 00:47:41,501
No. If a bypass exists, piranha haven't
the intelligence or the motivation to find it.

461
00:47:41,793 --> 00:47:46,715
But you know Hoak was breeding them
for endurance and intelligence and...

462
00:47:47,299 --> 00:47:50,594
- Well, Bob was a dreamer. He, er...
- Bob?

463
00:47:52,721 --> 00:47:54,598
Dr Hoak?

464
00:47:54,681 --> 00:47:56,600
You knew him?

465
00:47:57,809 --> 00:48:00,812
Fish genetics is a very small field.

466
00:48:01,021 --> 00:48:03,690
You were friends?

467
00:48:05,108 --> 00:48:08,820
Let's say we were
a great deal more than that.

468
00:48:10,614 --> 00:48:12,782
You're covering up.

469
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,581
Is it Waxman? Are you afraid of what
the army might do to you if you...

470
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:24,294
No, I'm not afraid. I'm a scientist.
I'm head of my department.

471
00:48:24,586 --> 00:48:27,797
It's just that there are priorities, and...

472
00:48:29,507 --> 00:48:32,302
some things are more important
than a few lives.

473
00:48:32,886 --> 00:48:36,514
That's not how Dr Hoak felt.
Not at the end.

474
00:48:38,183 --> 00:48:40,894
As I said, he was a dreamer.

475
00:48:42,312 --> 00:48:45,815
- (Waxman) The situation is under control.
- (Paul) Hold on. What is this?

476
00:48:46,107 --> 00:48:48,318
Why won't you listen to me?

477
00:48:48,485 --> 00:48:51,404
Would you excuse us
for a moment, please?

478
00:48:52,614 --> 00:48:55,992
As far as you're concerned,
this project does not exist.

479
00:48:56,284 --> 00:48:58,703
The piranha do not exist.

480
00:48:58,912 --> 00:49:00,997
- And if I make a squawk?
- Paul...

481
00:49:01,206 --> 00:49:04,417
The interests of national security
permit extreme measures.

482
00:49:04,584 --> 00:49:07,212
Oh, come on! The war's over, dammit!

483
00:49:07,504 --> 00:49:10,006
There’ll be other wars, Mr. Grogan.

484
00:49:11,299 --> 00:49:15,804
I think for your own protection
we'd better secure your tent for the night.

485
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:22,185
- Look who's here.
- What's goin' on?

486
00:49:22,519 --> 00:49:24,187
Nothin'.

487
00:49:33,613 --> 00:49:35,991
Psst! Is he still out there?

488
00:49:36,283 --> 00:49:37,492
Yep.

489
00:49:37,784 --> 00:49:39,911
- Then you’ll have to distract him.
- Why?

490
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:43,707
- So I can get away.
- So you can get away? What about me?

491
00:49:43,915 --> 00:49:47,502
- Suit yourself. But first you distract him.
- How?

492
00:49:47,794 --> 00:49:52,716
How would I know? Just get him with
his back to the opening. Come on to him.

493
00:49:57,304 --> 00:49:59,389
What if he's gay?

494
00:49:59,681 --> 00:50:02,183
Then I’ll distract him. Let's go.

495
00:50:06,313 --> 00:50:07,981
Hi.

496
00:50:08,690 --> 00:50:10,692
Uh...

497
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:12,819
Nice night, huh?

498
00:50:14,321 --> 00:50:16,781
- Listen, are you gay?
- What?

499
00:50:17,782 --> 00:50:19,284
Oh...

500
00:50:19,492 --> 00:50:23,705
Well, I was just reading
this article in this magazine, and...

501
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:27,208
- What did you ask me before?
- Look! Up in the sky!

502
00:50:27,709 --> 00:50:29,419
It's Superman!

503
00:50:36,509 --> 00:50:38,386
Oh, shit!

504
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:40,680
- What's wrong?
- Have you got a dime?

505
00:50:41,014 --> 00:50:42,891
(phone)

506
00:50:52,317 --> 00:50:54,110
Hello?

507
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:57,697
What? What piranhas?
What are you talking about?

508
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:00,408
What?

509
00:51:00,700 --> 00:51:02,994
Are you crazy? Who is this?

510
00:51:03,286 --> 00:51:08,208
Oh, Grogan. Yeah, I remember you.
You're not crazy, you're drunk.

511
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:12,212
No, I don't wanna talk to her.
I'm sure she's as drunk as you are.

512
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:15,006
You wake me up again,
I’ll have the cops on you.

513
00:51:15,382 --> 00:51:18,510
What? No, you can't talk to your daughter.

514
00:51:18,718 --> 00:51:21,096
Sober up, Grogan, and fly right!

515
00:51:26,393 --> 00:51:27,686
Piranhas!

516
00:51:28,687 --> 00:51:30,689
- Asshole!
- He didn't believe you.

517
00:51:30,897 --> 00:51:33,984
- He thinks I'm drunk.
- Can you get through to your daughter?

518
00:51:34,192 --> 00:51:36,611
No way. We gotta get down there.

519
00:52:02,721 --> 00:52:04,681
(siren)

520
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:08,018
Paul, behind us.

521
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:11,605
I know. No way we can
outrun him in this thing.

522
00:52:11,980 --> 00:52:14,399
Maybe we can talk to him.
Maybe he’ll believe us.

523
00:52:15,901 --> 00:52:19,321
Piranha, huh?
And where did they come from?

524
00:52:19,696 --> 00:52:22,115
From an army test site
up on the mountain.

525
00:52:22,282 --> 00:52:24,618
That's posted. There's no trespassing.

526
00:52:24,910 --> 00:52:28,079
Two people were killed up there,
and more along the river.

527
00:52:28,496 --> 00:52:30,081
You've gotta believe us.

528
00:52:30,290 --> 00:52:33,710
Now wait. Say, aren't you Grogan?

529
00:52:34,002 --> 00:52:36,713
- Yeah, that's right.
- Uh-huh. I remember.

530
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:39,591
We had you in on
a drunk and disorderly last month.

531
00:52:39,883 --> 00:52:44,512
I am not drunk! You give me a breath test,
whatever you want, only listen to me!

532
00:52:44,888 --> 00:52:48,516
I think I'm gonna take you up on that,
buddy. Back to the station.

533
00:52:48,808 --> 00:52:52,020
And you can explain why
you're in an army staff car.

534
00:52:52,312 --> 00:52:56,983
And don't you get any notion, man,
cos I got my gun in my other hand here.

535
00:52:57,317 --> 00:52:58,610
OK?

536
00:52:58,818 --> 00:53:01,112
Okey-dokey. Let's go.

537
00:53:06,117 --> 00:53:07,994
Yes. We've got a situation up here.

538
00:53:08,286 --> 00:53:12,582
A very delicate situation. And you can
help us control it by holding them for us.

539
00:53:13,291 --> 00:53:17,212
Yes, Colonel. Yes, yes.
I understand. We’ll do it.

540
00:53:17,587 --> 00:53:20,215
Make sure they don't
communicate with the outside.

541
00:53:20,382 --> 00:53:22,592
We're tryin' to avoid unnecessary panic.

542
00:53:22,801 --> 00:53:23,802
Certainly.

543
00:53:24,594 --> 00:53:27,180
Their best interests, I agree.

544
00:53:28,598 --> 00:53:31,017
Well, you're welcome, Colonel. Uh...

545
00:53:36,815 --> 00:53:39,109
See you in the mornin'.

546
00:53:49,119 --> 00:53:53,582
Well, you best make yourself comfortable,
folks. You’ll be spending the night.

547
00:53:53,915 --> 00:53:57,586
- What about a phone call?
- I don't wanna hear it.

548
00:53:57,794 --> 00:53:59,713
I don't wanna hear it.

549
00:54:00,005 --> 00:54:02,299
I gotta get back on that road now.

550
00:54:02,591 --> 00:54:05,886
So you folks, you just behave yourselves.

551
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:09,014
No, wait a minute. You can't just leave!

552
00:54:09,306 --> 00:54:11,808
My daughter's down there!

553
00:54:12,017 --> 00:54:15,812
There are kids down there,
and the piranhas are in the river!

554
00:54:16,897 --> 00:54:18,106
Please!

555
00:54:18,607 --> 00:54:24,195
The witch and the demons of the forest
scoured every corner of the church,

556
00:54:24,487 --> 00:54:28,116
venom dripping from their fangs.

557
00:54:28,408 --> 00:54:32,120
“Where is he?” hissed the witch.

558
00:54:33,204 --> 00:54:37,918
The demons peeled
their heavy eyelids back.

559
00:54:42,505 --> 00:54:43,590
There he is!

560
00:54:47,302 --> 00:54:51,514
(Waxman) There's absolutely no cause for
alarm. It's a complete hoax, believe me.

561
00:54:51,681 --> 00:54:53,183
Yeah.

562
00:54:53,516 --> 00:54:57,395
I just wanted to warn you in case
they were able to get a call through.

563
00:54:57,687 --> 00:55:00,815
Groundless panic wouldn’t help
our grand opening any.

564
00:55:01,399 --> 00:55:05,987
Uh-huh. I really appreciate the warning.
I’ll brief my staff. We’ll take care of it.

565
00:55:07,489 --> 00:55:09,407
Yeah. Don't worry.

566
00:55:10,784 --> 00:55:14,204
Uh-huh. By the way,
are you comin' down tomorrow?

567
00:55:14,996 --> 00:55:18,792
Ah, good. Your presence will lend
a certain prestige to the opening.

568
00:55:19,209 --> 00:55:20,418
Mm-hm.

569
00:55:20,502 --> 00:55:21,920
Huh?

570
00:55:25,006 --> 00:55:28,385
No. No, Colonel.
Nobody knows about your investment.

571
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:32,681
With me, a silent partner's
privacy is sacred.

572
00:55:32,889 --> 00:55:36,393
I swear to you on my honor
as a Texan, nobody knows.

573
00:55:38,186 --> 00:55:39,688
Yes, Colonel.

574
00:55:39,896 --> 00:55:42,315
Good night. Good night.

575
00:55:43,108 --> 00:55:44,818
Schmuck!

576
00:55:46,486 --> 00:55:50,907
Come on, you guys! Will you haul ass?
This stuff's gotta be set by ten o’clock.

577
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,286
What are you doing back there?

578
00:55:54,494 --> 00:55:56,788
Hide, that's all they do.
Drink beer and hide.

579
00:56:08,091 --> 00:56:09,801
- Hi.
- Hi.

580
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:15,682
I always like it at night.

581
00:56:16,308 --> 00:56:17,809
Yeah, me too.

582
00:56:18,393 --> 00:56:20,604
It's like it's resting.

583
00:56:20,812 --> 00:56:23,690
- Hey, wanna race me across?
- To the island?

584
00:56:23,982 --> 00:56:27,611
Yeah. Ever since I got here, I haven't
been able to just swim by myself.

585
00:56:27,986 --> 00:56:31,907
I've always had half a dozen
campers hangin' on to me.

586
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:35,911
I don't know. I don't feel like swimming.
But go ahead, I’ll watch you.

587
00:56:38,496 --> 00:56:41,499
- What's the matter?
- I don't know.

588
00:56:41,917 --> 00:56:44,294
Something... Something's wrong.

589
00:56:45,795 --> 00:56:48,590
Come on, come with me.
It'll do you some good.

590
00:56:48,798 --> 00:56:51,593
- You're probably right.
- Good. OK.

591
00:56:52,802 --> 00:56:54,679
Grogan, turn off that flashlight!

592
00:56:55,388 --> 00:56:57,390
Don't be alarmed - it's only me.

593
00:56:57,891 --> 00:57:01,102
There's a rumor some campers
are coming for a midnight swim.

594
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:05,190
If I catch them swimming, they’ll be
in pretty hot water, I can tell you.

595
00:57:05,482 --> 00:57:08,109
- What are you doing out here?
- Oh, well, we...

596
00:57:08,485 --> 00:57:11,696
I thought I heard some campers
swimming. We came down to look.

597
00:57:12,197 --> 00:57:14,991
- Swimming? Where?
- Over by the waterfall.

598
00:57:15,492 --> 00:57:17,786
The waterfall?
Is that where they're doing it?

599
00:57:17,994 --> 00:57:19,704
- (splash)
- What was that?

600
00:57:19,913 --> 00:57:22,916
It sounded like campers
on the other side of the lake.

601
00:57:23,583 --> 00:57:25,794
The other side of the lake?

602
00:57:26,920 --> 00:57:30,590
Thank you. Kim Burrell, is that you?

603
00:57:34,010 --> 00:57:36,805
Well, there's always
tomorrow for that swim.

604
00:57:37,013 --> 00:57:39,391
Yeah. Let's do it tomorrow.

605
00:57:47,607 --> 00:57:49,901
(banging on pipe)

606
00:57:55,115 --> 00:57:58,201
- What are you doin'?
- Did I tell you about Mo Schneider?

607
00:57:58,994 --> 00:58:02,914
- Who's that?
- This guy they sent me to find one time.

608
00:58:03,582 --> 00:58:08,420
He was a plumber. He kept running off
and getting busted for indecent exposure.

609
00:58:13,717 --> 00:58:15,594
What are you doin' there?

610
00:58:16,011 --> 00:58:19,890
Mo was in the poky so many times that
he developed a regular escape routine.

611
00:58:20,181 --> 00:58:22,684
Being a plumber,
he used what he knew best.

612
00:58:23,393 --> 00:58:24,519
(crash)

613
00:58:25,896 --> 00:58:28,106
What the hell was that?

614
00:58:28,899 --> 00:58:31,693
What are you doing? Are you all right?

615
00:58:32,986 --> 00:58:34,321
Christ, listen.

616
00:58:34,487 --> 00:58:38,783
This, uh, this plan,
whatever it is, did it ever work?

617
00:58:39,117 --> 00:58:42,495
No. But he came pretty
close a couple of times.

618
00:58:44,289 --> 00:58:47,000
Pretty damn close.

619
00:58:50,212 --> 00:58:55,383
What's all that racket? Sounds like the
roof fell in. What's all this water from?

620
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:59,221
Something's leaking,
and I’ll catch pneumonia if it doesn't stop.

621
00:58:59,512 --> 00:59:02,515
- What's the matter with that sink trap?
- I've tried,

622
00:59:02,682 --> 00:59:06,186
but I'm just not strong enough
to put the pipes back together.

623
00:59:06,519 --> 00:59:09,314
All right. Stand back, I’ll take a look at it.

624
00:59:17,113 --> 00:59:21,409
What the hell did you do to this thing?
Tryin' to crawl through the drainpipe?

625
00:59:30,210 --> 00:59:33,213
- What's happenin'?
- He's knocked out, but he's alive.

626
00:59:33,380 --> 00:59:36,216
Get his keys. Can you get his keys?

627
00:59:36,508 --> 00:59:40,387
- They're chained to his pants!
- Well, take his pants off, then.

628
00:59:51,398 --> 00:59:55,819
Come on. I'd have thought you could
get a man's pants off quicker than that.

629
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:04,411
Got 'em! I got 'em!

630
01:00:05,120 --> 01:00:07,497
Come on. Let's go.

631
01:00:09,708 --> 01:00:12,919
- What did you hit him with?
- A piece of the toilet lid.

632
01:00:13,211 --> 01:00:16,590
- Maybe I should have tried bribery first.
- Thank you, Mo Schneider.

633
01:00:17,007 --> 01:00:20,218
Don't suppose one of those
keys would fit a patrol car?

634
01:00:20,385 --> 01:00:22,804
I wouldn’t be surprised.

635
01:01:09,017 --> 01:01:10,310
(applause)

636
01:01:10,518 --> 01:01:12,979
Howdy, folks. I'm Buck Gardner.

637
01:01:14,314 --> 01:01:15,815
Thank you.

638
01:01:15,982 --> 01:01:17,984
(cheering)

639
01:01:21,404 --> 01:01:23,114
Thank you. I appreciate that.

640
01:01:23,907 --> 01:01:27,619
On behalf of Buck Gardner's
Aquarena Development Corporation,

641
01:01:27,994 --> 01:01:32,415
it gives me great pleasure to invite you
here to our opening-day festivities.

642
01:01:35,085 --> 01:01:38,380
If you have any questions about
purchasing land up here,

643
01:01:38,713 --> 01:01:42,592
our people will be mingling in the crowd
to answer your questions.

644
01:01:42,884 --> 01:01:47,681
You got no obligation to buy anything,
only to enjoy yourselves. Annie?

645
01:01:51,810 --> 01:01:53,395
Right there.

646
01:01:53,687 --> 01:01:55,397
Right there.

647
01:01:56,898 --> 01:01:58,316
Try again.

648
01:01:58,483 --> 01:02:00,193
Nice try, kid.

649
01:02:00,986 --> 01:02:02,612
That's it!

650
01:02:05,198 --> 01:02:09,119
Don't forget, free barbecue
this afternoon at one o’clock.

651
01:02:09,411 --> 01:02:11,121
Enjoy yourselves.

652
01:02:12,080 --> 01:02:13,498
We got 'em.

653
01:02:17,794 --> 01:02:21,089
No comics! No comics. No discipline.

654
01:02:25,218 --> 01:02:26,386
(Whistle)

655
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,598
Water competition.
Muster up. Water competition.

656
01:02:29,806 --> 01:02:32,517
Put the arrows away.
Put the bows in the tep...

657
01:02:42,485 --> 01:02:43,820
That isn't funny.

658
01:02:43,987 --> 01:02:44,988
(Whistle)

659
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:47,115
Minnows, over here!

660
01:02:47,407 --> 01:02:49,284
Come on, kids.

661
01:02:51,286 --> 01:02:53,204
Come on, you guys.

662
01:02:53,788 --> 01:02:58,710
Guppies! Come on, let’s go!
Come on, line up. That's right. Come on.

663
01:02:59,085 --> 01:03:01,713
Standing in line. Straight line.

664
01:03:03,006 --> 01:03:06,801
Straighten up. OK. We're gonna
have a tube race. Who's gonna win?

665
01:03:07,093 --> 01:03:09,304
- Minnows!
- (all) We are!

666
01:03:09,596 --> 01:03:11,389
We are!

667
01:03:11,598 --> 01:03:14,017
All right. OK, you guys.

668
01:03:14,184 --> 01:03:17,020
You cannot swim with your glasses on.

669
01:03:17,312 --> 01:03:20,190
Let's turn this way now.
Buddy system. Arms up.

670
01:03:20,398 --> 01:03:22,817
There we go. Stand up straight. Come on.

671
01:03:23,109 --> 01:03:26,488
- Stand up straight.
- Come on, be proud you're a Guppy.

672
01:03:28,782 --> 01:03:31,409
That's good. That's good.
Hold your stomach in.

673
01:03:31,701 --> 01:03:34,913
(Dumont) Morning, campers.
Fall in back here and buddy up.

674
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:37,415
Mr. Dumont, we're ready for you, sir.

675
01:03:37,707 --> 01:03:39,417
(Whistle)

676
01:03:40,210 --> 01:03:41,920
Arms down!

677
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:47,008
All right now. This is where we separate
the tortoises from the hares,

678
01:03:47,300 --> 01:03:51,596
the wheat from the chaff,
and the sinkers from the swimmers.

679
01:03:53,098 --> 01:03:54,808
Salt water.

680
01:03:55,100 --> 01:03:57,811
- What?
- I just remembered. It was salt water.

681
01:03:58,103 --> 01:04:00,897
- What was?
- In the pond at the test site.

682
01:04:01,314 --> 01:04:04,109
- I thought it was strange, then I forgot.
- So?

683
01:04:05,110 --> 01:04:09,197
Piranha are freshwater fish.
Hoak must have developed a strain

684
01:04:09,614 --> 01:04:12,409
that can live both in fresh and salt.
Like salmon.

685
01:04:15,787 --> 01:04:19,082
- That's why they headed downstream.
- And if they get to the ocean?

686
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:23,795
There’ll be no way to contain 'em. They’ll
be able to swim up every river system.

687
01:04:24,087 --> 01:04:26,006
(shrieking)

688
01:04:49,905 --> 01:04:52,699
What are you doing?
You should be in that race.

689
01:04:53,283 --> 01:04:56,119
- But Betsy told me...
- I don't want to hear any excuses.

690
01:04:56,411 --> 01:04:59,080
- Get a tube and get out there.
- But I hurt my knee.

691
01:04:59,289 --> 01:05:00,999
On the double, camper!

692
01:05:09,382 --> 01:05:11,218
(Whistle)

693
01:05:11,384 --> 01:05:13,303
Listen up, you kids!

694
01:05:13,511 --> 01:05:16,014
We're gonna start
the tube race in a minute.

695
01:05:16,306 --> 01:05:18,808
Kathryn! McCarthy! MacBride!

696
01:05:19,184 --> 01:05:21,603
All you campers, come in here.
You're too far out.

697
01:05:25,482 --> 01:05:27,692
Goddamn Sunday driver.

698
01:05:40,997 --> 01:05:42,916
(Whistle)

699
01:05:44,709 --> 01:05:45,919
Ready?

700
01:05:46,211 --> 01:05:47,087
(bang)

701
01:06:04,604 --> 01:06:06,982
(Dumont) Come on! This is a race, people!

702
01:06:37,095 --> 01:06:41,016
Jacobson, put a little muscle in it!
Parkinson, a little effort!

703
01:07:12,380 --> 01:07:15,091
Kids, let’s get a little leg action!

704
01:07:25,518 --> 01:07:26,686
(screams)

705
01:07:29,481 --> 01:07:31,107
What's the matter?

706
01:07:32,609 --> 01:07:34,402
What is that?

707
01:08:00,095 --> 01:08:00,887
(screams)

708
01:10:03,009 --> 01:10:06,304
- Suzie! Suzie, no. Go back! Go back!
- Get on the boat.

709
01:10:27,409 --> 01:10:28,910
Betsy!

710
01:10:33,999 --> 01:10:34,791
Betsy!

711
01:10:59,983 --> 01:11:00,984
Suzie!

712
01:11:01,610 --> 01:11:03,403
Daddy!

713
01:11:04,487 --> 01:11:09,200
There's a phone in there. Call the resort
and warn 'em. I’ll get the kids out.

714
01:11:16,208 --> 01:11:20,795
Operator, get me the number
of the Aquarena Springs Resort.

715
01:11:21,087 --> 01:11:22,797
Look in the phone book.

716
01:11:23,089 --> 01:11:27,385
Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself.
Everything's free today. Enjoy yourself.

717
01:11:27,719 --> 01:11:29,679
Keep 'em moving, Terry.

718
01:11:32,515 --> 01:11:34,893
Wrong away, kid. This is the exit.

719
01:11:38,313 --> 01:11:40,607
- Hey, baby.
- Mr. Gardner? Mr. Gardner?

720
01:11:40,815 --> 01:11:43,193
- What is it?
- Real important.

721
01:11:44,819 --> 01:11:47,614
- Buck Gardner.
- Now listen to me.

722
01:11:47,781 --> 01:11:51,701
This is not a crank call.
I am completely serious.

723
01:11:53,787 --> 01:11:54,788
Emergency?

724
01:11:55,580 --> 01:11:57,791
Easy. Easy.

725
01:11:58,083 --> 01:12:00,293
I got you. I got you.

726
01:12:00,585 --> 01:12:02,504
All right.

727
01:12:03,004 --> 01:12:05,590
Please. Please, you've gotta believe me.

728
01:12:07,092 --> 01:12:10,595
- Thank you.
- Listen to me! Please, before it's...

729
01:12:10,804 --> 01:12:13,306
Thank you. Piranha.

730
01:12:28,405 --> 01:12:32,701
- They're sending an ambulance.
- We gotta drive to the resort ourselves.

731
01:12:32,909 --> 01:12:36,204
- Can you handle this?
- Uh, yeah. I think so.

732
01:12:46,590 --> 01:12:49,301
Honey, I’ll be back
for you real soon, I promise.

733
01:12:49,593 --> 01:12:52,304
So you be brave, huh? Help out here?

734
01:12:55,181 --> 01:12:57,183
That's my girl.

735
01:13:05,317 --> 01:13:07,402
It's OK, Suzie.

736
01:13:07,694 --> 01:13:09,613
He'll be back.

737
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:49,402
We got plenty of targets.
Yes, sir. Right over there.

738
01:14:00,997 --> 01:14:03,708
By the way, sir, they've noticed.

739
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:06,920
One woman recognized
the submarine ride from Florida.

740
01:14:07,087 --> 01:14:09,798
Of course she did.
I picked it up second-hand.

741
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:14,386
Skyway's from Redondo Beach.
Boathouse is army surplus.

742
01:14:14,803 --> 01:14:17,305
Dancing chickens?
From a carnival in Idaho.

743
01:14:17,597 --> 01:14:20,100
Ralph the Swimming Swine?
From Atlantic City.

744
01:14:20,308 --> 01:14:23,520
They're saying, for a new resort,
nothing's looking very new.

745
01:14:23,812 --> 01:14:27,691
What do they know? Ralph the Swimming
Swine's practically a national monument.

746
01:14:28,108 --> 01:14:30,819
He's been swimming for
more years than I can remember.

747
01:14:30,986 --> 01:14:35,490
The other stuff they just don't make. That
submarine ride is a piece of Americana.

748
01:14:35,782 --> 01:14:37,284
Yes, sir.

749
01:14:37,409 --> 01:14:40,120
- Maybe they never heard of recycling.
- I don't know.

750
01:14:40,412 --> 01:14:44,583
Smile, we're goin' public.
Hello, Senator. How are you?

751
01:14:44,916 --> 01:14:46,209
(siren)

752
01:14:54,718 --> 01:14:57,721
If they get to the media,
we're both screwed.

753
01:15:00,807 --> 01:15:04,019
Colonel Waxman. Dr Mengers.
What a pleasant surprise.

754
01:15:04,185 --> 01:15:06,187
They busted jail.

755
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,110
- They already called.
- Is your staff ready?

756
01:15:12,319 --> 01:15:14,696
- They're all set.
- Call your local newspaper.

757
01:15:14,988 --> 01:15:17,282
Warn 'em they might get
some crank calls.

758
01:15:17,490 --> 01:15:20,619
- Wouldn’t it be better...
- You got your orders. Hop to it.

759
01:15:20,785 --> 01:15:23,413
Cool it with the military crap.
I’ll take care of it.

760
01:15:23,705 --> 01:15:26,208
Whitney? Let's hop to it.

761
01:15:31,004 --> 01:15:34,382
- General Waxman, it's been so long.
- It's Colonel, ma'am.

762
01:15:34,716 --> 01:15:37,594
Colonel, still? Oh, I can't imagine why.

763
01:15:37,886 --> 01:15:40,180
Politics, ma'am. Politics.

764
01:15:43,600 --> 01:15:45,310
Stupid cow.

765
01:15:58,907 --> 01:16:00,909
- Ready?
- (Water-skier) OK.

766
01:17:35,420 --> 01:17:37,797
Hey, he really does ski great.

767
01:17:43,220 --> 01:17:46,598
- He's such a show-off.
- He thinks he's such hot shit.

768
01:17:46,890 --> 01:17:50,602
- Maybe we're not going fast enough.
- I can fix that.

769
01:18:14,292 --> 01:18:16,503
Hold it! There's something back here!

770
01:18:19,005 --> 01:18:21,591
Take it in! Now!

771
01:18:23,301 --> 01:18:27,013
- I think something's wrong.
- Yeah, we haven't dumped him yet.

772
01:18:40,610 --> 01:18:41,611
Stop!

773
01:18:45,991 --> 01:18:50,620
Take me in! There's something in here!
Come on! Get me outta here!

774
01:18:50,996 --> 01:18:52,789
Slow down. Stop!

775
01:18:54,791 --> 01:18:57,502
Faster! Don't stop!

776
01:18:59,212 --> 01:19:01,715
- Wait. He says...
- No!

777
01:19:03,091 --> 01:19:05,594
Speed up. Speed up!

778
01:19:09,389 --> 01:19:10,807
Stop!

779
01:19:29,910 --> 01:19:31,786
(siren)

780
01:19:48,803 --> 01:19:50,805
(screams)

781
01:19:53,683 --> 01:19:56,186
Argh! Argh! Argh!

782
01:20:31,096 --> 01:20:32,389
(screams)

783
01:20:49,281 --> 01:20:50,907
Dammit!

784
01:20:55,704 --> 01:20:58,415
No, Bob. It's completely false.

785
01:20:58,582 --> 01:21:01,501
There's not a word
of truth to it, believe me.

786
01:21:01,793 --> 01:21:03,712
- Sir?
- I'm on the phone!

787
01:21:04,087 --> 01:21:05,380
(Whispers) Piranhas.

788
01:21:05,589 --> 01:21:07,799
- Don't even say that word!
- But the piranhas...

789
01:21:08,091 --> 01:21:11,219
- What about the piranhas?
- They're eating the guests, sir.

790
01:21:17,517 --> 01:21:18,894
Uh...

791
01:21:19,102 --> 01:21:24,316
Bob, I'm gonna have to get back to you on
this. We've got a... a situation down here.

792
01:21:24,691 --> 01:21:26,401
(screams)

793
01:21:29,696 --> 01:21:31,489
(everybody screaming)

794
01:22:12,489 --> 01:22:14,991
Come on. Get off! You’ll tip us over.

795
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:25,085
Get off!

796
01:22:39,182 --> 01:22:41,101
Dammit, get off!

797
01:24:25,789 --> 01:24:27,707
Where are we going?

798
01:24:27,916 --> 01:24:31,002
The lake narrows where
the outlet for the refinery was.

799
01:24:31,211 --> 01:24:34,005
They’ll be bunched tight
when they come through there.

800
01:24:34,297 --> 01:24:35,382
What then?

801
01:24:35,715 --> 01:24:40,095
If it isn't tapped off, there might be
enough waste left in the smelting tanks.

802
01:24:40,387 --> 01:24:43,306
- It'll kill the fish?
- It'll kill anything.

803
01:24:43,515 --> 01:24:46,309
We’ll pollute the bastards to death.

804
01:24:55,610 --> 01:24:57,320
Oh, Lord. No.

805
01:25:00,407 --> 01:25:02,492
- What's wrong?
- It's all flooded.

806
01:25:02,701 --> 01:25:05,412
The control booth is underwater.

807
01:25:05,620 --> 01:25:08,582
- What can we do?
- Well, we gotta do somethin'.

808
01:25:09,708 --> 01:25:12,085
- Where's that towline?
- It's in the back.

809
01:25:17,382 --> 01:25:20,886
So I want you to start
counting slowly up to 100.

810
01:25:21,094 --> 01:25:25,682
Then, whether I'm up to the surface or
not, hit that throttle and get outta here.

811
01:25:26,099 --> 01:25:30,896
If I'm not up by then, I'm in trouble, cos
that's as long as I can hold my breath.

812
01:25:31,396 --> 01:25:34,316
So, let’s count it down together.

813
01:25:34,608 --> 01:25:36,318
- OK?
- Yeah.

814
01:25:36,484 --> 01:25:38,194
- One.
- One.

815
01:25:38,320 --> 01:25:39,613
Two.

816
01:25:39,779 --> 01:25:40,989
- Three.
- Three.

817
01:25:41,281 --> 01:25:42,407
- Four.
- Four.

818
01:25:42,490 --> 01:25:43,992
Five.

819
01:25:44,201 --> 01:25:46,119
Six.

820
01:25:46,411 --> 01:25:47,787
Seven.

821
01:26:40,590 --> 01:26:41,716
48.

822
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,884
49.

823
01:27:42,611 --> 01:27:43,695
63.

824
01:27:43,987 --> 01:27:44,905
64.

825
01:28:08,595 --> 01:28:09,804
82.

826
01:28:10,013 --> 01:28:11,014
83.

827
01:28:37,207 --> 01:28:38,416
98.

828
01:28:38,500 --> 01:28:39,918
99.

829
01:28:40,085 --> 01:28:41,795
100.

830
01:29:28,717 --> 01:29:29,801
Paul!

831
01:29:31,094 --> 01:29:35,599
Lost River Lake.
Terror, horror, death. Film at 11.

832
01:30:18,808 --> 01:30:21,102
- (man) Medic!
- (Woman) Help!

833
01:30:24,105 --> 01:30:28,109
What the hell are you filming?
What the hell are you filming?!

834
01:30:37,994 --> 01:30:40,413
Try and take some.

835
01:30:41,414 --> 01:30:43,583
Where do we go from here, Dr Mengers?

836
01:30:43,917 --> 01:30:47,712
I'm personally going to head
a full-scale investigation into this incident,

837
01:30:48,004 --> 01:30:52,801
to discover who was responsible, and
to ensure this could never happen again.

838
01:30:53,093 --> 01:30:55,804
As an expert in tropical species,
what danger is there

839
01:30:56,179 --> 01:30:58,890
in the possibility of
the piranha reaching the ocean?

840
01:30:59,099 --> 01:31:02,686
Oh, none. Most of them will have
been destroyed by pollution at the lake.

841
01:31:02,894 --> 01:31:06,606
If any did get through, there's no way
they could survive the salt water.

842
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:15,000
just resync for BluRay
