1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,200
(嚴禁入內）

2
00:01:00,637 --> 00:01:03,217
你要去哪裡？
It's got to lead somewhere.

3
00:01:07,427 --> 00:01:11,307
嗯，我們馬上就紮營，上氣不接下氣嗎？
Well, we'll stop and make camp  pretty soon. Got your breath?

4
00:01:13,307 --> 00:01:15,227
是啊，走吧
Yeah. Let's go.

5
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:25,827
這是什麼地方？
What is this?

6
00:01:29,617 --> 00:01:34,627
以前肯定有人呆過，我們進去看看
It doesn't look like anyone's been here for  a while. Let's go inside and check it out.

7
00:01:35,127 --> 00:01:38,917
- 真的要進去嗎？ - 芭芭拉，沒事的
- Think we should?  - Barbara, who'd know the difference?

8
00:01:39,127 --> 00:01:41,127
好吧
OK.

9
00:01:46,307 --> 00:01:49,727
進來吧，沒有背包很容易過來
Besides, a little lawbreaking'll  do you good.

10
00:02:02,197 --> 00:02:04,907
你的地圖上沒有這個地方
Wonder why this place  wasn't on your map.

11
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:07,827
可能是個秘密的地方
Maybe it's  supposed to be a secret.

12
00:02:08,037 --> 00:02:10,037
可能是
Maybe.

13
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:14,497
嘿！
Hey!

14
00:02:16,127 --> 00:02:17,997
游泳池！
Far out!

15
00:02:31,597 --> 00:02:33,517
感覺好極了
It feels great.

16
00:02:34,097 --> 00:02:37,727
我們洗澡吧，然後好好睡個覺
Come on, let's wash off, so it won't  be so funky in that sleeping bag.

17
00:02:38,017 --> 00:02:40,527
有人會看見的
What if somebody catches us?

18
00:02:40,817 --> 00:02:43,237
有誰會看見？
Who's gonna catch us?

19
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:48,327
這裡沒有人
There's nobody here.

20
00:02:51,327 --> 00:02:53,327
我們洗澡吧
Let's get wet.

21
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:57,337
- 看誰先脫完 - 我從沒幹過這種事
- Last one in is a rotten egg.  - That's really original.

22
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:02,797
- 等等 - 什麼？
- Wait a minute.  - What?

23
00:03:04,297 --> 00:03:07,507
萬一這裡是污水處理廠呢？
What if this is some kind  of a sewage treatment plant?

24
00:03:07,927 --> 00:03:09,807
白癡
Idiot.

25
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:14,937
你又搗鬼
Now you're gonna get it.

26
00:03:18,517 --> 00:03:20,527
感覺怎麼樣？
How is it?

27
00:03:23,397 --> 00:03:25,317
我來了
Here I come.

28
00:03:32,537 --> 00:03:34,497
- 這不好笑 - 什麼？
- That's not funny.  - What?

29
00:03:34,707 --> 00:03:37,707
你咬我，不敢相信你咬我
You bit me. I can't believe  you actually bit me.

30
00:03:37,917 --> 00:03:40,707
我看起來像巫婆嗎？
What do I look like?  A creature from the black lagoon?

31
00:03:40,997 --> 00:03:44,627
你是患多疑症吧，不要開玩笑了
You are paranoid, kid. Listen,  I'll race you to the deep end.

32
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:08,027
芭芭拉！水裡面有東西
Barbara! There's something in here!

33
00:04:08,527 --> 00:04:09,817
大衛！
David!

34
00:04:09,907 --> 00:04:11,117
他媽的！
God damn!

35
00:04:11,697 --> 00:04:13,407
大衛！
David!

36
00:04:20,997 --> 00:04:22,997
大衛?
David?

37
00:04:26,007 --> 00:04:27,927
大衛！
David!

38
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,597
大衛！ 大衛！
David! David!

39
00:05:36,947 --> 00:05:41,147
《食人魚》

40
00:07:16,507 --> 00:07:19,807
- 坐吉普車去嗎？ - 我們走的是沒有鋪過的山路
- Rent a Jeep?  - She'll be on unpaved mountain roads...

41
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,427
好吧，我簽字
All right. Where do I sign?

42
00:07:27,807 --> 00:07:32,317
你到了印第安泉會有吉普車在那兒等你 那邊的路非常顛簸
We're all set. At lndian Springs you'll get  a Jeep. The roads are very rough there.

43
00:07:32,737 --> 00:07:34,607
沒事
No sweat.

44
00:07:35,527 --> 00:07:37,407
- 我可以搞定的 - 我知道
- I can handle it.  - I know.

45
00:07:37,697 --> 00:07:40,117
不然的話就不派你去了
I wouldn't send you if  I didn't think you could.

46
00:07:40,407 --> 00:07:42,327
等一下，好了
Wait. Got ya.

47
00:07:45,117 --> 00:07:46,997
- 我先到印第安泉 - 對
- I found the bigamist.  - Right.

48
00:07:47,207 --> 00:07:49,497
- 那裡有吉普車在等我？ - 對
- And the bad-cheque lady?  - Right.

49
00:07:49,707 --> 00:07:53,127
- 而且路很顛簸 - 是的，那是個小鎮
- And Mo Schneider.  - Three times, but those were all in town.

50
00:07:53,417 --> 00:07:55,927
而你是在城市裡長大 而那邊是一座大山
You're a city kid.  These kids are out in the boon...

51
00:07:56,127 --> 00:07:59,217
我什麼都能找到，我的前生是一條偵探犬
I can find anything, Earl.  I'm two-thirds bloodhound.

52
00:07:59,427 --> 00:08:02,017
你僱傭我的時候我告訴過你
I told you that when you hired me.

53
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:09,397
哦，天吶，我的票呢？我放在口袋裡了
Oh, my gosh. My ticket. I could  have sworn I put it in my pocket.

54
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:11,607
我的票跑哪裡去了？
Where's my ticket?

55
00:08:17,817 --> 00:08:19,697
- 我完全可以搞定 - 你當然可以
- I can manage it.  - Of course you can.

56
00:08:20,027 --> 00:08:22,827
- 往銀行存錢 - 那可是我的錢
- It's money in the bank.  - My money.

57
00:08:50,397 --> 00:08:53,517
布蘭迪，你好啊
Hello, Brandy. How are you, huh?

58
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:03,117
去一趟城裡要花我越來越多的時間了
This hike from town is  gettin' longer every week.

59
00:09:03,617 --> 00:09:07,117
- 你得弄輛車，傑克 - 我有車
- You oughta get a car, Jack.  - I got a car.

60
00:09:07,997 --> 00:09:10,627
這地方車用不了多久
It's up on blocks. That's where it belongs.

61
00:09:14,627 --> 00:09:16,627
蘇格蘭威士忌
Scotch.

62
00:09:17,627 --> 00:09:19,627
杜松子酒
Gin.

63
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:22,717
奔農酒

64
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:30,937
還有哈奇拉酒！
Tequila!

65
00:09:32,227 --> 00:09:34,517
你真是雪中送炭啊，傑克
You're the 7th Cavalry, Jack.

66
00:09:34,727 --> 00:09:36,897
你知道我的酒正好快沒了
You know, I just ran dry today.

67
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:40,607
那邊有燕麥片，可我不願上那裡去拿
Your corn meal is down there, but  I ain't gonna walk down and get it.

68
00:09:41,027 --> 00:09:43,527
光喝酒我可活不了
Man cannot live by booze alone.

69
00:09:47,197 --> 00:09:50,827
全都給你吧，夠了嗎？
In lieu of rent. What's up in town?

70
00:09:51,917 --> 00:09:55,417
- 鎮裡情況怎麼樣？ - 和以前一樣
- Same as usual.  - I bet you miss it, Jack, huh?

71
00:09:56,337 --> 00:10:00,717
我想你肯定想到鎮上去居住吧？ 那邊生活方便多了
I bet you miss sellin' whatever  it was. That plastic fruit.

72
00:10:01,797 --> 00:10:03,797
不
No.

73
00:10:04,427 --> 00:10:06,307
看看這河
Got the river.

74
00:10:08,427 --> 00:10:11,017
每天早上起來
It wakes me up in the morning.

75
00:10:13,897 --> 00:10:16,517
讓人心曠神怡
Gives me a bath.

76
00:10:16,897 --> 00:10:18,817
還有我的小屋
Does the laundry.

77
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:25,197
還有我的晚餐 晚上睡覺也特別安靜
Gives me my dinner.  Puts me to sleep real gentle.

78
00:10:26,327 --> 00:10:28,327
還有樹林
I got my river.

79
00:10:29,117 --> 00:10:30,827
還有布蘭迪
I got Brandy.

80
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:34,917
一切都有了
Paul.

81
00:10:37,707 --> 00:10:40,207
你有什麼呢？
What have you got up here?

82
00:10:41,417 --> 00:10:44,717
我有蘇格蘭威士忌，杜松子酒，奔農酒，還有哈奇拉酒
I got scotch, gin, bourbon, and tequila.

83
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:47,807
- 這些足夠了吧？ - 很好
- What's it to you, anyhow?  - OK.

84
00:10:49,217 --> 00:10:51,517
好了，夥計，再見
OK, buddy. I'll see you.

85
00:10:52,307 --> 00:10:54,307
跟上，布蘭迪
Come on.

86
00:10:54,937 --> 00:10:56,897
悠著點，布蘭迪
Take it easy, Brandy.

87
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:28,507
哇！
Ow!

88
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:41,897
嗯
Hm.

89
00:11:57,827 --> 00:11:59,707
門開著
It's open.

90
00:12:02,627 --> 00:12:04,507
你是保羅 格羅根嗎？
Paul Grogan?

91
00:12:05,927 --> 00:12:09,637
你好，我叫瑪吉.邁克歐文 是為一家找人公司工作的
Hi. I'm Maggie McKeown.  I work for a skip-tracing company.

92
00:12:09,927 --> 00:12:12,807
- 什麼公司？ - 我們查找失蹤人口
- What's that?  - We find missing people.

93
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:15,727
是我前妻叫你來的嗎？
Did my ex-wife send you?

94
00:12:16,017 --> 00:12:17,727
不
No.

95
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,307
嗯
Um...

96
00:12:19,517 --> 00:12:22,317
我找兩個年輕人
I'm looking for a pair of teenage kids.

97
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:25,237
他們的朋友說他們可能來這兒旅行了
Some friends said they might  be backpacking up here.

98
00:12:25,397 --> 00:12:29,027
我沒看見他們，你找別人去問吧
I haven't seen 'em. Did you  talk to the sheriff's people?

99
00:12:29,317 --> 00:12:32,197
- 他們說這是一座大山 - 對，確實如此
- They said it was a big mountain.  - They're right. It is.

100
00:12:34,537 --> 00:12:38,917
我猜他們是沿著河走的，這附近有游泳的地方嗎？
I figured they may have followed the river.  Are there any places to swim near here?

101
00:12:39,417 --> 00:12:42,997
如果他們被淹死了，肯定被衝到大壩去了
Well, if they'd drowned,  they'd be swept down to the dam.

102
00:12:43,337 --> 00:12:45,917
你找錯地方了
So you're startin' at the wrong end.

103
00:12:46,417 --> 00:12:49,007
可能只是找錯人了吧
Boy, you're the wrong end all right.

104
00:12:50,297 --> 00:12:53,927
我是不是打攪你了？ 但我這是很重要的事情
Look, am I interrupting something?  This is kind of important.

105
00:12:54,307 --> 00:12:56,017
嘿
Hey,

106
00:12:56,227 --> 00:12:58,437
你說話口氣不太對，女士
you cool your jets, lady.

107
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:03,317
我沒有殺人，我幫不了你，因為我沒見過他們
I didn't axe-murder your young couple.  I can't help you. I haven't seen 'em.

108
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:08,697
這兒附近有什麼棚屋嗎？
Are there any other shacks up here?

109
00:13:09,027 --> 00:13:11,527
只有茅屋，這就是個茅屋
Cabins. This is a cabin.

110
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:15,827
還有沒有別的？他們可能被綁架在哪兒了？
Are there any more of them? Any places  where they might be holed up?

111
00:13:17,407 --> 00:13:21,417
一個叫傑克的老傢伙在河邊有一個小木屋
There's an old fella named Jack,  has a place down the river a bit,

112
00:13:21,627 --> 00:13:23,837
不過也沒聽說有什麼年輕人來過
but he's not with them.

113
00:13:24,127 --> 00:13:28,007
不過在山頂上有個軍方實驗室
And there was some kind of army  test site way up the mountain.

114
00:13:28,297 --> 00:13:31,637
- 只是已經關閉五六年了 - 那好，我們走吧
- That closed down five or six years ago.  - Come on. Let's go.

115
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:34,507
- 去哪兒？ - 你帶我去你說的地方
- Go where?  - You're taking me up there.

116
00:13:36,217 --> 00:13:37,807
我不去
Oh, no, I'm not.

117
00:13:42,897 --> 00:13:45,107
你覺得我是在浪費我的時間嗎？
You think I'm wasting my time, don't you?

118
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:47,897
才不是，你是在浪費我的時間
No. I think you're wastin' my time.

119
00:14:18,517 --> 00:14:22,517
- 發現什麼了嗎？ - 還沒有，不過現在天還早
- Find anything yet?  - Not yet, but it's still early in the day.

120
00:15:03,097 --> 00:15:04,597
大衛！
David!

121
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,317
芭芭拉！
Barbara!

122
00:15:20,537 --> 00:15:23,117
- 軍方在這裡做什麼試驗？ - 天知道
- What were they testing here?  - Who knows?

123
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:27,417
我和前妻曾來過一次
I hiked up here once with my ex-wife.  They had guard dogs out.

124
00:15:27,837 --> 00:15:30,297
那時籬笆都裝上了電網
The fence was electrified. The works.

125
00:15:38,507 --> 00:15:40,717
BR. 芭芭拉.蘭多夫
"BR." Barbara Randolph.

126
00:15:42,427 --> 00:15:44,307
嗯
Hm.

127
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:51,027
水好冷
Man, that is cold.

128
00:15:51,227 --> 00:15:53,737
他們的父母說他們的水性都不錯
Their parents said they  were excellent swimmers.

129
00:15:54,027 --> 00:15:56,697
他們不會現在才浮起來吧？
Wouldn't they be floatin'  up on top by now?

130
00:15:56,907 --> 00:15:59,407
屍體浮上來需要一段時間
It takes a while for  the body to bloat with gas.

131
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:01,697
你還挺專業的
Nice business you're in.

132
00:16:02,037 --> 00:16:04,327
這池塘有沒有放水塞子呢？
You think there's a way  to pull the plug on this?

133
00:16:12,207 --> 00:16:15,797
- 熱帶魚？ - 看上去像是實驗用的
- Tropical fish?  - Looks like it's for laboratory rats.

134
00:16:16,127 --> 00:16:20,007
訓練他們穿越障礙找到食物
You know, where they had to get through  an obstacle course to get a reward.

135
00:16:20,307 --> 00:16:21,307
嗯
Hm.

136
00:16:31,017 --> 00:16:33,027
還是熱的
Still warm.

137
00:17:29,417 --> 00:17:31,917
過來，快看這個
Come here. Take a look at this.

138
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:37,627
噁心
Yeuch.

139
00:17:44,807 --> 00:17:48,727
我們走吧，這地方讓我毛骨悚然
Let's get outta here.  This place gives me the creeps.

140
00:18:04,407 --> 00:18:06,697
嘿！你幹什麼…
Hey! What are you...

141
00:18:10,707 --> 00:18:13,327
他們來過這兒，沒錯
Well, they've been here all right.

142
00:18:15,417 --> 00:18:17,797
而且沒有離開
And they never left.

143
00:18:20,427 --> 00:18:24,137
- 我要把池塘的水全部放掉 - 可是沒有人允許
- I say we drain the pond.  - Well, now. Now, wait a minute.

144
00:18:24,427 --> 00:18:28,517
你是不能這樣做的
You can't do that without gettin'  somebody's permission, you know.

145
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:33,727
這是我們解決問題最快的辦法
If it works it's the quickest way  to know if they're down there.

146
00:18:33,897 --> 00:18:36,317
天吶，你在幹什麼？
What are you doing?

147
00:19:08,927 --> 00:19:11,227
你沒事吧？
Are you all right?

148
00:19:16,607 --> 00:19:18,517
- 他還活著嗎 - 他還有氣
- He's breathing.  - No thanks to you.

149
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:22,817
- 都怪你，該怎麼辦，我有任務在身 - 反正我又不會怪你
- What was I supposed to do?  - I would have got loose in a second.

150
00:19:23,237 --> 00:19:27,407
- 我的酒壺都被你打壞了 - 能讓我喝口水嗎？
- Look at this. You put a dent in it.  - Could I have a sip of that, please?

151
00:19:28,827 --> 00:19:30,827
那不是水
It's not water.

152
00:19:41,007 --> 00:19:43,717
- 怎麼樣？ - 有點鹹
- What is it?  - The water's salty.

153
00:19:48,007 --> 00:19:49,427
這個池塘的水會放到哪兒去？
Where does this drain to?

154
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:51,927
軍方接管之前，這個池塘是孵化魚苗用的
It was a fish hatchery  before the army took it over.

155
00:19:52,227 --> 00:19:55,097
也許是放到河裡去了
It probably drains  underground into the river.

156
00:19:55,937 --> 00:19:57,107
啊噢
Uh-oh.

157
00:20:04,027 --> 00:20:09,527
可能是條狗，可它怎麼會掉到這兒來
I think it's a dog. I don't suppose  they would have fit through here.

158
00:20:10,027 --> 00:20:12,327
一點肉也不剩
Not in one piece.

159
00:20:14,207 --> 00:20:16,417
你覺得剛才那個人還在那兒嗎？
You think he's all right up there?

160
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:21,127
哦，糟糕
Oh, shit.

161
00:20:24,627 --> 00:20:26,217
我的天啊
Oh, my God.

162
00:20:37,727 --> 00:20:40,607
我肯定是忘了拔鑰匙
I guess I must have left  the keys in it. Huh?

163
00:21:20,097 --> 00:21:22,517
- 他還活著 - 他真命大
- He's alive.  - He's indestructible.

164
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:27,817
別怕，別怕，沒事
Easy. Easy, now. Easy. Easy.

165
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:31,817
- 你闖禍了 - 我闖了什麼禍？
- Razorteeth.  - What's "razorteeth"?

166
00:21:32,027 --> 00:21:33,617
- 你把池塘的水放了？ - 是的…
- You drained the pond?  - Yes...

167
00:21:33,827 --> 00:21:35,827
- 它們出來了 - 什麼出來了？
- You let them out?  - Let who out?

168
00:21:36,037 --> 00:21:37,707
沒事吧？
What's he doin'?

169
00:21:37,907 --> 00:21:40,497
你們不知道，現在事情鬧大了
You don't know what  you've done. Untie me.

170
00:21:41,327 --> 00:21:43,997
我的問題是，你自己幹了什麼
The question is, what you've done, mister.

171
00:21:44,207 --> 00:21:46,207
你不明白
You don't know.

172
00:21:46,507 --> 00:21:50,007
它們非常聰明，你們鬥不過它們的
They breed like flies.  There'll be no way to stop them.

173
00:21:50,297 --> 00:21:53,427
冷靜點好嗎？那兩個孩子呢？
Would you talk sense, dammit?  What about those kids?

174
00:21:53,717 --> 00:21:57,517
我不能告訴你，它們會殺光我們的
I can't tell you. Mother of God,  they'll kill us. They'll kill all of us.

175
00:21:57,927 --> 00:22:01,597
先生，聽著，你還是好好休息吧
OK, mister, listen. They're gonna  sweat it out of you in town.

176
00:22:02,807 --> 00:22:04,817
它們會殺了我們的
They'll kill us.

177
00:22:05,107 --> 00:22:07,527
我們都做了些什麼？
What have we done?

178
00:22:20,117 --> 00:22:22,127
哦，上帝啊
Oh, my God.

179
00:22:34,297 --> 00:22:37,597
- 他說會有什麼東西來殺他 - 有可能
- He thinks someone's going to kill him.  - He's right.

180
00:22:37,927 --> 00:22:40,437
他是犯了多疑症吧
I am, if he steps out of line.

181
00:22:41,517 --> 00:22:43,897
- 給我一支煙好嗎？ - 沒有
- Do you have any cigarettes?  - No.

182
00:22:44,227 --> 00:22:46,897
一年前戒了，我現在只喝酒
I quit a year ago.  It interfered with my drinking.

183
00:22:48,527 --> 00:22:51,107
我進來呆一會兒行嗎？
Do you mind if I come in for a minute?

184
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:53,697
當然可以
Sure.

185
00:22:59,697 --> 00:23:02,207
你是在那之前還是在那之後開始喝酒的？
So, did you start drinking before or after?

186
00:23:02,417 --> 00:23:05,627
- 什麼之前之後？ - 你妻子離開你
- Before or after what?  - Your wife left you.

187
00:23:06,917 --> 00:23:12,217
- 這算是個什麼問題？ - 對不起，我只是有點感興趣而已
- What the hell kind of question is that?  - Look, I'm sorry. I was just interested.

188
00:23:17,007 --> 00:23:18,597
嗯
Um,

189
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:21,427
我坐這兒行嗎？
do you mind if I sit here?

190
00:23:22,517 --> 00:23:24,437
坐吧
Go ahead.

191
00:23:31,107 --> 00:23:33,907
- 你結婚多久了 - 嗯？
- How long were you married?  - Huh?

192
00:23:34,107 --> 00:23:36,027
Um,

193
00:23:36,197 --> 00:23:38,327
十年
ten years.

194
00:23:38,527 --> 00:23:41,907
我們十七歲時就在父親的車中相愛了
She was just 1 7 when we  eloped in her father's car.

195
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:46,417
然後就結婚了
Man, we thought we had  the world by the balls.

196
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:53,127
你住在哪兒？
Where did you live?

197
00:23:53,297 --> 00:23:57,637
小鎮上，本來我在河邊辦了個工廠
In town. I worked in  a smeltin' operation downriver.

198
00:23:57,927 --> 00:24:01,017
可是被政府關閉了，說那對河裡的魚有影響
The government closed us down.  Said we killed too many fish.

199
00:24:01,307 --> 00:24:05,727
他們把工廠給了軍隊，軍隊又賣給了別人
They gave it to the army, and the  army sold it to some resort ouftit.

200
00:24:06,517 --> 00:24:10,317
有人在用我原來的地方大發其財
So you know that somebody's makin'  bundles somewheres along the line.

201
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:12,897
那你現在以什麼為生？
How do you make a living now?

202
00:24:13,237 --> 00:24:15,527
我做一些零工
Back pay. Unemployment.

203
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:18,197
九月份就有活幹了
Gonna have to go to work  come September.

204
00:24:19,617 --> 00:24:22,327
還要照顧我女兒蘇珊
Keep my daughter in saddle shoes.

205
00:24:23,707 --> 00:24:26,707
- 你女兒和你住在一起嗎？ - 對
- Does your daughter live with you?  - Yeah.

206
00:24:34,417 --> 00:24:36,297
- 怎麼了？ - 嗯？
- What's wrong?  - Hm?

207
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:39,927
- 你好像很緊張 - 嗯？
- You're so tense.  - Hm?

208
00:24:41,507 --> 00:24:45,437
我不知道，我習慣了一個人
I don't know. I guess I'm not  used to bein' around people.

209
00:24:47,307 --> 00:24:52,107
本來說進來呆一會兒的，現在待了這麼久
That's obvious. I've been trying to hint  my way under the covers for five minutes.

210
00:24:54,107 --> 00:24:56,607
沒事
You are really somethin'.

211
00:25:04,827 --> 00:25:08,827
沒有了你的吉普車，我們很難出去的
There's no way we're gonna get  this guy down to town without your Jeep.

212
00:25:08,997 --> 00:25:12,497
可我們要採取點行動，他的顱骨已經破裂了
We have to do something.  He might have fractured his skull.

213
00:25:13,417 --> 00:25:17,217
我們把他帶到大壩那邊去 對不起，讓你久等了
We gotta get him to the dam.  There's usually a ranger there.

214
00:25:17,507 --> 00:25:20,297
- 我們怎麼去呢？ - 木筏
- How do we get there?  - On a raft.

215
00:25:22,507 --> 00:25:25,427
- 別開玩笑了，我們到底怎麼去 - 你會知道的
- Stop kidding. How do we get there?  - You'll see.

216
00:25:27,097 --> 00:25:29,807
我去年夏天看了我女兒的「哈克貝利.費恩歷險記」
I read my daughter  Huckleberry Finn last summer.

217
00:25:30,017 --> 00:25:34,897
上面就有坐木筏歷險的描述，這是唯一出去的辦法
We wanted to light out for the territories  so we settled on this as a compromise.

218
00:25:35,237 --> 00:25:38,607
- 看上去做的挺結實 - 是啊，木頭都是我自己砍的
- It looks authentic.  - Yeah. We cut all the logs ourselves.

219
00:25:39,027 --> 00:25:41,527
每個釘子都是我敲進去的，非常結實
Not a single nail in her. It's all lashing.

220
00:25:43,027 --> 00:25:47,207
- 你女兒現在在哪兒？ - 大壩旁的一個夏令營
- Where's your daughter now?  - Summer camp, other side of the dam.

221
00:25:47,497 --> 00:25:49,917
這東西真不穩
Just how sturdy is this thing?

222
00:25:50,207 --> 00:25:52,497
可以坐三個人
I think it'll hold three people.

223
00:25:52,837 --> 00:25:57,507
不過告訴你實話，我也沒坐過 我女兒有恐水症
To tell you the truth, we never tried it.  My daughter's afraid of the river.

224
00:25:58,417 --> 00:26:02,427
Boys are made of greasy grimy gopher guts！
Boys are made  of greasy grimy gopher guts

225
00:26:02,717 --> 00:26:04,597
Mutilated monkey meat！
Mutilated monkey meat

226
00:26:04,807 --> 00:26:06,597
Little dirty birdie feet！
Little dirty birdie feet

227
00:26:06,807 --> 00:26:08,937
Sneezed-up snail snot！
Sneezed-up snail snot

228
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:11,097
Bashed-in beetles' brains！
Bashed-in beetles' brains

229
00:26:11,307 --> 00:26:14,397
All in a bottle of blood！
All in a bottle of blood

230
00:26:22,907 --> 00:26:25,907
蘇珊 蘇珊 寶貝，不要害怕
Suzie? Suzie, honey, don't be scared.

231
00:26:27,037 --> 00:26:29,497
你只要游過去然後再游回來
You just have to swim out  to the marker and back.

232
00:26:29,827 --> 00:26:32,627
如果在游泳池裡，你可以游這兩倍的距離
You've probably swum  twice that far in a pool.

233
00:26:35,917 --> 00:26:40,007
如果你不能通過單人游泳考試的話 你就得不到水上徽章
If you don't pass your solo swim  you can't get your water badge.

234
00:26:40,297 --> 00:26:42,297
拿不到就算了
I don't care.

235
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:45,807
你到底怕什麼呢，親愛的？
What is it that you're afraid of, honey?

236
00:26:46,097 --> 00:26:48,727
- 水裡的東西 - 你是說海怪嗎？
- Things.  - You mean like sea monsters?

237
00:26:50,597 --> 00:26:53,017
這兒只有一些小魚
There's just a few little fish in here.

238
00:26:53,227 --> 00:26:55,897
在河底的水草裡
They eat plants at the bottom of the river.

239
00:26:56,107 --> 00:26:59,107
它們只會親親你的小手指和小腳趾
They're not interested  in little girls' fingers and toes.

240
00:26:59,397 --> 00:27:02,027
- 迪金森！ - 在這兒，杜蒙特先生
Dickinson!  - Dickinson!  - Over here, Mr Dumont.

241
00:27:10,327 --> 00:27:13,207
有你的信，迪金森，又是那個男孩
Letter for you, Dickinson. That same boy.

242
00:27:13,497 --> 00:27:15,417
哦，謝謝你
Oh, thank you.

243
00:27:15,917 --> 00:27:18,207
你還是不敢下河游泳嗎？蘇珊
Still haven't tackled  your solo swim, Grogan?

244
00:27:18,417 --> 00:27:19,417
是的
No, sir.

245
00:27:19,627 --> 00:27:22,007
她怕水裡的東西
She's kind of afraid of things in the water.

246
00:27:22,217 --> 00:27:27,717
東西，什麼東西？小魚嗎？ 人是吃魚的，可魚不吃人
Things? What things? Fish? People eat  fish, Grogan. Fish don't eat people.

247
00:27:29,597 --> 00:27:33,437
你想輸掉夏令營競賽嗎？
Do you wanna be the one to lose the  camp competition for the Minnows?

248
00:27:33,727 --> 00:27:35,307
當然不會
Course you don't.

249
00:27:35,897 --> 00:27:41,027
- 她在手工藝方面非常出色 - 手工藝鍛煉不了膽量
- She's doing really well on handicrafts.  - Handicrafts don't take any nerve.

250
00:27:41,397 --> 00:27:44,407
知道我的意思嗎？格羅根小姐？
Any intestinal fortitude.  You know what that means, Grogan?

251
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:46,907
- 是的，先生 - 對
- Yes, sir. Guts.  - Right.

252
00:27:47,117 --> 00:27:49,697
有她的信件嗎？
Is there any mail for her?

253
00:27:51,537 --> 00:27:53,997
沒有，堅強些，格羅根小姐
Nope. Skunked again, Grogan.

254
00:27:56,207 --> 00:27:57,837
格羅根.
Grogan.

255
00:27:57,997 --> 00:28:00,127
膽子大一些
Guts.

256
00:28:03,717 --> 00:28:05,507
Uh...

257
00:28:05,797 --> 00:28:08,807
我們走吧，去玩壟斷遊戲
Come on, let's go.  We'll play some Monopoly.

258
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:13,307
明天早上我們去試一下，好嗎？
Why don't we try it in  an inner tube tomorrow? Huh?

259
00:28:14,597 --> 00:28:16,517
走吧
Come on.

260
00:28:26,817 --> 00:28:28,697
嘿，布蘭迪
Hey, Brandy.

261
00:28:29,617 --> 00:28:33,197
我給你講一個關於狗的故事，它叫菲利普
Did I ever tell you about that  other dog of mine called Philip?

262
00:28:35,117 --> 00:28:37,707
它是一隻非常機靈的狗
Philip grew up in Baltimore with me.

263
00:28:38,497 --> 00:28:40,707
它是一隻好狗
He was a good dog.

264
00:28:40,997 --> 00:28:42,417
它…
He...

265
00:28:45,927 --> 00:28:48,507
有一天它穿過一條街道
He run across the street one day,

266
00:28:49,927 --> 00:28:53,427
它在一輛貨車前面跑過
and he walked right  in front of a trolley car.

267
00:28:53,597 --> 00:28:56,017
貨車壓到了它的尾巴
It ran over his tail. It surprised him.

268
00:28:56,437 --> 00:28:59,107
它感到疼，然後猛一轉身
He turned around and the trolley car...

269
00:28:59,307 --> 00:29:02,817
我在給你講故事呢，然後貨車壓到了它的頭
I'm tellin' you a story. The  trolley car ran over his head.

270
00:29:05,107 --> 00:29:10,117
這個故事有什麼寓意呢？很有趣吧？
It's what you call losin' your head over  a little piece of tail. Pretty funny, huh?

271
00:29:14,617 --> 00:29:17,207
你怎麼了？
What's the matter with you?

272
00:29:19,917 --> 00:29:23,627
你不喜歡我的故事嗎？ 也許你沒理解，反應太快也不是好事
You didn't like the story? Want me  to tell another? Maybe you didn't get it.

273
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:28,217
這很好玩嗎？
Are you soft in the head?

274
00:29:43,607 --> 00:29:45,817
好的，朋友
OK, my friend.

275
00:29:46,027 --> 00:29:48,817
第一個問題： 那些孩子到底怎麼啦？
Number one:  what happened to those kids?

276
00:29:52,117 --> 00:29:56,617
好的第二個： 你在為軍方幹什麼？
All right, then, try number two: what  were you doin' up at the army site?

277
00:29:56,907 --> 00:29:59,327
- 別這樣做 - 別緊張
- Stop that!  - Oh, he speaks.

278
00:29:59,997 --> 00:30:01,127
嘿
Hey.

279
00:30:01,827 --> 00:30:06,207
- 別把手放進水裡 - 這水怎麼啦？
- Keep your hand out of the water.  - What's wrong with the water?

280
00:30:06,797 --> 00:30:10,297
能告訴我們你的名字嗎？
Since you're talkin' this morning,  buddy, how about a name?

281
00:30:10,637 --> 00:30:13,217
我叫羅伯特.浩克
Hoak. Dr Robert Hoak.

282
00:30:13,507 --> 00:30:18,017
- 水怎麼了？ - 水裡有會吃人的魚
- What's wrong with the water?  - The water is filled with carnivorous fish.

283
00:30:18,307 --> 00:30:20,227
食人魚
Piranha.

284
00:30:20,807 --> 00:30:22,107
哦，我的天
Oh, Christ.

285
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:26,027
就在這裡面？它們怎麼會在這裡？
In here? How did they get in?

286
00:30:26,317 --> 00:30:29,527
你把池塘水放干的時候，它們就出來了
You let them in when you drained  the pond at the test site.

287
00:30:29,817 --> 00:30:32,317
- 池塘… - 食人魚是熱帶魚
- Paul...  - Piranha are tropical fish.

288
00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:36,197
這裡是冰冷的山區，到這裡它們活不過一分鐘
This is cold mountain water. They  wouldn't last in here for a minute.

289
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:39,407
那骨架是怎麼回事？
What about that skeleton?

290
00:30:42,327 --> 00:30:45,837
好了，告訴我，為什麼那池塘裡會有食人魚？
OK. What would piranha  be doin' up in that pond?

291
00:30:48,127 --> 00:30:50,007
Huh?

292
00:30:50,427 --> 00:30:52,927
- 還不到時候 - 嘿
- Untie me.  - Hey...

293
00:30:54,137 --> 00:30:56,927
我可以把你扔到水裡
What if I dipped you in  the water a little bit first, Doc?

294
00:30:57,217 --> 00:31:00,517
你明白嗎？
See if you're makin'  the whole thing up or not. Huh?

295
00:31:04,017 --> 00:31:06,017
布蘭迪.
Brandy.

296
00:31:06,317 --> 00:31:08,317
是傑克的狗
That's Jack's dog.

297
00:31:08,607 --> 00:31:10,527
它總是這麼凶嗎？
Is he always so ferocious?

298
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:15,697
我以前沒看見過它這樣
I don't think I ever heard him do  more than roll over and beg for food.

299
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:18,617
我們最好過去看看
We'd better take a look.

300
00:31:37,427 --> 00:31:39,307
別緊張，布蘭迪，別緊張
Easy, boy. Easy.

301
00:32:03,827 --> 00:32:07,627
他死前奮力爬到這裡，流血過多而死
He must have dragged himself  this far. Bled to death.

302
00:32:13,797 --> 00:32:15,717
我很難過
I'm sorry.

303
00:32:20,097 --> 00:32:22,097
我去找把鏟子
I'll get a shovel.

304
00:32:23,227 --> 00:32:25,807
他不想被埋在鎮上
He wouldn't wanna be buried in town.

305
00:32:40,617 --> 00:32:43,197
- 就游一次也不行嗎？ - 不行
- Even in an inner tube, huh?  - Uh-huh.

306
00:32:44,207 --> 00:32:48,127
- 不可能會下沉的 - 可它們還是會抓住你的
- It's almost impossible to fall in.  - But they can still get you.

307
00:32:48,417 --> 00:32:50,207
它們？
They, huh?

308
00:32:50,337 --> 00:32:54,917
行，如果你真的是這樣想的話 我會說服他們允許你不參加比賽
OK. lf that's really the way you feel about  it, I'll try and help you get out of the race.

309
00:32:55,217 --> 00:32:59,137
但必須找一個理由，而且不能撒謊
But we've got to come up  with an excuse. Do not lie.

310
00:32:59,717 --> 00:33:03,017
- 我在手工藝製作上拿了名次 - 夏令營還有別人也拿了
- I got poison ivy.  - So does everybody else in the camp.

311
00:33:03,427 --> 00:33:07,227
也許你可以說....不過你還太小了
Hey, maybe you could just be getting  your... No, you're too young for that.

312
00:33:07,937 --> 00:33:09,397
嗯？
Huh?

313
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:12,227
等一等，我有個主意，跟我來
Wait a minute. I have an idea.  Come with me.

314
00:33:16,027 --> 00:33:18,527
坐這兒
Come here. Sit down here.

315
00:33:19,117 --> 00:33:22,907
你看這個紙箱子，我給你的膝蓋上…
Let's see what we have in our  magic box. Give me your knee.

316
00:33:24,537 --> 00:33:28,417
在比賽之前在大家面前假裝摔一跤
OK. Get Darlene to take  your place in the race. OK?

317
00:33:28,917 --> 00:33:31,417
然後倒在地上呻吟
And if Dumont squawks, limp a lot.

318
00:33:32,337 --> 00:33:35,007
我會給你包紮一個大繃帶
And, uh, I'll get you  a huge bandage for this.

319
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:41,717
好像是一株水草
Feels like this thing's  snagged on the bottom.

320
00:33:42,007 --> 00:33:45,217
- 把我的網纏繞住了 - 要我幫忙嗎？
- Got myself tangled in it too.  - Want me to help?

321
00:33:45,517 --> 00:33:48,517
不用，你呆在那兒別動，否則小船會翻掉的
No, you better stay there.  You might tip the canoe.

322
00:33:48,727 --> 00:33:53,107
爸爸，你經常這樣抓魚嗎？我說在你小時候
I thought you knew all about this kind  of fishing, from when you were a boy.

323
00:33:53,517 --> 00:33:57,317
我小時候抓魚沒這麼費勁
Listen, when I was a boy we made  our own nets and made 'em right.

324
00:33:58,107 --> 00:34:01,697
越纏越緊了，哇！
Jesus. It feels like  something's snagged in here. Ow!

325
00:34:02,327 --> 00:34:04,407
- 被咬了嗎？ - 啊！
- Did you get bit?  - Ouch!

326
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:06,827
- 啊！ - 爸爸！
- Ow!  - Dad!

327
00:34:06,997 --> 00:34:10,207
- 呆在那裡！別過來！ - 爸爸！爸爸！
- Stay back! Stay back!  - Dad! Dad!

328
00:34:20,797 --> 00:34:21,927
爸爸！
Dad!

329
00:34:25,517 --> 00:34:28,017
- 政府付你工資嗎？ - 當然付
- The government paid you?  - Of course they paid.

330
00:34:28,427 --> 00:34:31,727
細菌戰武器，炸彈，化學武器
Where there's germ warfare,  the bomb, chemical warfare,

331
00:34:32,607 --> 00:34:35,317
這些都是需要很多錢的，我們是特殊機構
there's plenty of money.  Special agencies.

332
00:34:36,897 --> 00:34:41,197
他們付的錢比我私下做研究賺到的錢多得多
They pay. They pay a lot better  than they do in private research.

333
00:34:42,117 --> 00:34:43,907
就為了養幾條魚
For raisin' fish.

334
00:34:45,027 --> 00:34:47,617
不，是遺傳學
Oh, no. It's a matter of genetics.

335
00:34:49,207 --> 00:34:51,707
用放射性物質進行有選擇的繁殖
Radiation. Selective breeding.

336
00:34:52,627 --> 00:34:55,707
他們把這種研究叫軍用遺傳學
They called it Operation Razorteeth.

337
00:34:58,127 --> 00:35:00,007
那些是幹什麼用的？
What was it all for?

338
00:35:00,297 --> 00:35:03,717
破壞敵人的用水系統
To destroy the river systems  of the North Vietnamese.

339
00:35:04,007 --> 00:35:09,097
我們的目標是繁育出可以在冷水中生存的食人魚
Our goal was to develop a strain of this  killer fish that could survive in cold water

340
00:35:09,427 --> 00:35:11,727
並且能以最快的速度進行繁殖
and then breed at an accelerated rate.

341
00:35:12,807 --> 00:35:15,397
可惜沒能投入應用
We had everything. Blank cheque.

342
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:18,527
因為戰爭結束了
And then the war ended.

343
00:35:19,027 --> 00:35:20,897
聽你這麼說好像很失望
You sound disappointed.

344
00:35:21,527 --> 00:35:23,617
之後他們在池塘裡放了毒藥
They poisoned the water.

345
00:35:23,907 --> 00:35:28,037
準備把它們都殺死
After all that work,  they poisoned the water.

346
00:35:28,697 --> 00:35:30,707
可是還是有些魚活了下來
But some survived.

347
00:35:30,907 --> 00:35:34,997
我們研究出的變異品種可以抵抗毒藥
We developed a lot of mutants and a few  of them were able to resist the poison.

348
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:38,207
這些變異品種繁殖能力變得越來越強
They ate their own. Their own dead.

349
00:35:38,417 --> 00:35:43,127
就像是一個新的物種
And then began to breed  like some wild species.

350
00:35:44,137 --> 00:35:47,007
突然之間就有了好幾百條 甚至是幾千條
Suddenly there were hundreds.  Maybe thousands.

351
00:35:47,717 --> 00:35:52,017
- 你的實驗還是很成功的嘛，嗯？ - 這本來是為軍事防衛而設的科學研究
- Our tax dollars at work, huh?  - That's science in the service of defence.

352
00:35:52,437 --> 00:35:56,227
當然現在已經不是了
Sure. Spreadin' strains  of bacteria in the subway system.

353
00:35:56,607 --> 00:36:00,817
它們在河中是會吃人的
You put them in the river where they  could kill people. lncluding civilians.

354
00:36:01,317 --> 00:36:04,407
- 包括平民，以及在河裡游泳的小孩 - 我可沒有殺人
- And kids swimming in the rivers.  - I never killed anybody.

355
00:36:04,697 --> 00:36:08,407
如果有人想殺人那是政府和軍方
If you wanna talk about killing,  talk to your politicians, the military.

356
00:36:08,697 --> 00:36:10,827
不，我是個科學家
No, no. I'm a scientist.

357
00:36:11,537 --> 00:36:14,117
- 河裡的小孩 - 什麼？
- Kids in the water.  - What?

358
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:16,207
大壩
The dam.

359
00:36:16,417 --> 00:36:20,297
他們每隔幾天就開閘放水一次 以保持湖裡穩定的水量
They let water through every few days  to keep the level steady on the new lake.

360
00:36:20,627 --> 00:36:25,127
大壩下面有度假村和夏令營，小孩們都在那兒，快點
The resort's down there. Summer camp.  All those kids. Come on.

361
00:36:49,407 --> 00:36:51,407
Hey, stop splashin'！
Hey, stop splashin'!

362
00:36:53,617 --> 00:36:57,497
這純粹是個科學研究 可一旦暫時沒有戰爭
It was pure research.  No scrounging for grant money.

363
00:36:57,917 --> 00:37:01,207
這些政客就把資金撤走了 你知道這對於一個科學家的意義
No academic politics. You don't know  what that means to a scientist.

364
00:37:02,417 --> 00:37:05,007
你餵養了它們，你讓它們變異而存活下來
You fed them. You kept them alive.

365
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:08,217
我私下裡繼續做實驗
I continued the experiment.

366
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:11,217
對於這個物種我還有很多工作要做
There was so much more  I could do with the species.

367
00:37:11,597 --> 00:37:14,097
它們會變得更有用
So much further I could take them.

368
00:37:15,097 --> 00:37:18,017
你們不會認為我要負全部責任吧？
You're not holding me responsible?

369
00:37:20,227 --> 00:37:25,107
我認為是的  池塘的塞子是你拔掉的 難道要我負全部責任嗎？
I think you are. You pulled the plug and  you're holding me responsible. lncredible.

370
00:37:26,527 --> 00:37:28,197
居然怪到我頭上來了
You're blaming me.

371
00:37:29,117 --> 00:37:32,197
你如果再不閉嘴 我就把這個桿子塞進去
I think if you open your mouth again  I'll stick this pole in it.

372
00:37:32,407 --> 00:37:36,917
- 他們是不是已經把大壩的閘門打開了？ - 我不知道，只希望還沒有
- You think they've opened the dam yet?  - I don't know. We can only hope not.

373
00:37:37,917 --> 00:37:39,917
爸爸
Daddy.

374
00:37:45,207 --> 00:37:47,797
快點
Let's move it.

375
00:37:48,127 --> 00:37:51,007
- 那船在下沉 - 對
- It's sinking, Paul. The canoe is sinking.  - Yeah.

376
00:37:57,517 --> 00:37:59,517
爸爸？
Daddy?

377
00:38:02,607 --> 00:38:05,027
爸爸！爸爸！你在哪兒
Daddy! Daddy! It's going under.

378
00:38:06,527 --> 00:38:09,407
別下水
Don't do it! Get outta there!

379
00:38:13,117 --> 00:38:15,117
快點，瑪吉
Come on, Maggie.

380
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:01,207
堅持住！堅持
Hold it here. Hold it.

381
00:39:10,507 --> 00:39:13,007
快點！快點！
Come on! Come on! Come here!

382
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:17,717
快點！抓住我的手
Come on! Give me your hand.

383
00:39:18,017 --> 00:39:20,307
快上船，快把他拉上來
Get the doctor. OK, now the doctor.

384
00:39:43,117 --> 00:39:44,997
放鬆，教授
Easy, Doc.

385
00:39:45,627 --> 00:39:47,917
你不會死的
Here. Here you go.

386
00:39:50,917 --> 00:39:55,137
我們該怎麼辦？該怎麼辦？
What do we do? What do we do?  How do we stop them?

387
00:40:03,017 --> 00:40:04,437
哦，天吶
Oh, Christ.

388
00:40:13,027 --> 00:40:15,407
營員們，該上來吃飯了
Campers. No swinging after lunch.

389
00:40:42,017 --> 00:40:44,807
現在可以確認它們能在冷水中生存了
So far we know that they  can live in cold water.

390
00:40:47,517 --> 00:40:50,107
它們好像是順流而下
They seem to be  moving downstream.

391
00:40:50,607 --> 00:40:54,317
我們必須找到能夠對付它們的人
Gotta find someone who knows  how to deal with these things.

392
00:40:55,407 --> 00:40:58,317
我們得先到大壩到那兒去打電話
There'll be a phone at the dam.  We can call on ahead.

393
00:41:01,907 --> 00:41:04,327
- 嘿 - 怎麼了？
- Hey.  - What?

394
00:41:05,997 --> 00:41:10,497
我不知道是怎麼回事，好像下面有東西在動
I don't know. It seems like  the lashing's workin' loose.

395
00:41:17,717 --> 00:41:21,007
保羅... 下面有東西
Paul... there's something under us.

396
00:41:34,027 --> 00:41:37,027
是血！是血把它們引來的
His blood. It's the doc's blood.

397
00:41:38,317 --> 00:41:42,197
它們在拆船，一點點的咬斷繩子
It's seepin' through. They're eatin'  away at the lashing to get to it.

398
00:41:45,197 --> 00:41:47,827
- 爸爸！ - 不要，我們必須減輕負載
- Daddy!  - Let go, son. No. We gotta get rid of him.

399
00:41:48,117 --> 00:41:50,497
不，我爸爸掉進河裡去了
No. That's what happened to my daddy.

400
00:41:50,707 --> 00:41:52,997
- 快點 - 它們在吃他
- Let go.  - They're eating him.

401
00:41:53,417 --> 00:41:55,627
他們吃掉了他！
They're eating him!

402
00:41:58,927 --> 00:42:01,717
- 過來 - 它們吃了我爸爸！
- Come here.  - They got my daddy!

403
00:42:57,527 --> 00:42:59,817
你沒事吧，孩子？你怎麼樣？
You OK, boy? How about you?

404
00:43:00,027 --> 00:43:03,027
- 我沒事 - 你們待在這兒
- I'm all right.  - You gotta stay here.

405
00:43:03,407 --> 00:43:07,407
我到大壩去，要趕在他們開閘放水之前
I'm gonna try to get to the dam before  they let 'em through with the water.

406
00:43:20,467 --> 00:43:23,967
警告：喇叭聲後隨即開閘放水

407
00:43:49,827 --> 00:43:53,627
Acres and acres of reclaimed land nestled in a scenic mountain valley,

408
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:56,337
site of the newly formed Lost River Lake.

409
00:43:58,207 --> 00:44:01,417
Swimming, sailing, snorkeling, skin diving, shuffleboard,

410
00:44:01,797 --> 00:44:05,007
and Buck Gardner's Aquarena Amusement Arcade.

411
00:44:07,927 --> 00:44:11,597
So pack up your RVs, your station Wagons, your trailers and cars,

412
00:44:11,937 --> 00:44:16,227
and hustle on up to Lost River Campsite for a free introductory Weekend.

413
00:44:24,817 --> 00:44:28,527
別開閘！ 你說什麼？別開閘！
Don't open it!  Whatever you do, don't open it.

414
00:45:00,317 --> 00:45:04,027
好了，下車集中，快點！
All right, men, off your butts.  Fall in. Move it!

415
00:45:13,327 --> 00:45:17,207
我們對此心存疑慮，因為我們不能每天都能碰到這種事
Forgive our scepticism, but we don't  come across stories like yours every day.

416
00:45:17,627 --> 00:45:20,417
食人魚是熱帶魚種，這裡又不是亞馬遜河
Piranha are warm-water fish.  This is hardly the Amazon.

417
00:45:20,627 --> 00:45:25,127
我告訴你了，這是變異品種 它們已經殺了五個人了
But I told you, these are mutations.  They've already killed five people.

418
00:45:25,427 --> 00:45:28,717
- 是科幻小說吧 - 誘餌準備好了嗎？
- Science fiction.  - You ready with that bait, soldier?

419
00:45:29,007 --> 00:45:31,507
- 是的，長官 - 放吧
- Yes, sir.  - Let her go, son.

420
00:45:38,307 --> 00:45:42,897
據我所知，軍方在山頂確實有個實驗室 不過那在72年就關閉了
Actually, a piranha was caught once  in a pond in Miami, in '72, I believe.

421
00:45:43,227 --> 00:45:46,607
他們已經都把魚毒死了 不會還有什麼食人魚跑到河裡來
But the Fish and Game Commission  poisoned the water, and that was that.

422
00:45:47,027 --> 00:45:50,407
- 這我們都知道 - 有時候會有一些謠言，但…
- That was that, huh?  - The rumours persisted, you know, but...

423
00:45:50,617 --> 00:45:53,037
拉起來
Pull it in, son.

424
00:46:01,997 --> 00:46:04,507
軍事，讓少校準備炸藥
Sergeant, tell the major  to start the pumps.

425
00:46:04,707 --> 00:46:07,297
我們要把它們封鎖在這個河區
We should be able to  contain them in this area.

426
00:46:07,507 --> 00:46:11,637
把河邊的度假村和夏令營都關閉 我們可能會用新型劇毒藥品
Piranha travel in schools, and we've  brought heavy doses of rotenone 235.

427
00:46:12,007 --> 00:46:15,017
- 你確信這些魚能被毒死嗎？ - 這一帶的河水會不會受污染呢？
- Came well-prepared, didn't you?  - Won't it ruin the river?

428
00:46:15,307 --> 00:46:17,437
有的時候僅僅是污染還不夠，還得摧毀
Sometimes you need to destroy  in order to save.

429
00:46:17,727 --> 00:46:20,607
如果它們知道了我們的計劃之後又逆河而上呢？
What if they realise they're  bein' slaughtered and leave?

430
00:46:20,897 --> 00:46:23,107
格羅根先生，我們對付的是魚
We're talking about fish, Mr Grogan.

431
00:46:23,317 --> 00:46:27,027
- 它們不會知道太多的東西 - 等一等，你以為自己在哄小孩嗎？
- They don't realise much of anything.  - Who are you trying to kid?

432
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:30,107
如果你不知道它們的厲害怎麼會帶這麼多人過來呢？
You must've known  all along they were here.

433
00:46:30,407 --> 00:46:35,117
行了，格羅根先生 現在只有你和這位女士知道它們存在
OK. You and Miss McKeown are the only  two civilians who know about this project.

434
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:41,002
上校的意思是說 他希望你們能加入我們的隊伍
What the colonel means is that he'd like  you to join us. Become one of our team.

435
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:45,507
我明白了
It figures.

436
00:46:54,724 --> 00:46:55,934
不可能
Impossible.

437
00:46:57,018 --> 00:47:01,606
你是個上校，對嗎？我肯定你能看懂地圖
Look, you're a full colonel, right?  I assume you can read a map. Here.

438
00:47:02,232 --> 00:47:04,234
我們在大壩，對吧？
We are here at the dam, OK?

439
00:47:04,401 --> 00:47:07,737
再看這兒，這條小溪流入大壩
Over here you'll see there's  a stream that feeds into it.

440
00:47:08,113 --> 00:47:12,409
好，從這條小溪逆流而上大概8公里路 你看這兒有個分岔
Follow the stream back for an eighth  of a mile and you see there's a fork.

441
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:15,203
從這個小支流，一直向下
Take this branch, follow it downstream,

442
00:47:15,412 --> 00:47:19,124
你會發現水流可以通向大壩的另一頭
and you'll see it empties into the  river on the other side of the dam.

443
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:22,711
換句話說，這些魚知道怎麼跨越障礙
In other words, the piranha have  a way to get around the obstacle.

444
00:47:22,919 --> 00:47:26,715
如果他是對的，你不覺得應該採取點行動嗎？
Even if there's a chance he's right,  don't you think you should do something?

445
00:47:27,132 --> 00:47:32,220
不，即使支流存在，食人魚也沒有這個耐力和智力
No. lf a bypass exists, piranha haven't  the intelligence or the motivation to find it.

446
00:47:32,512 --> 00:47:37,434
可你沒有聽到浩克說的話，他培養了它們的耐力和智力
But you know Hoak was breeding them  for endurance and intelligence and...

447
00:47:38,018 --> 00:47:41,313
鮑伯是個夢想家
- Well, Bob was a dreamer. He, er...  - Bob?

448
00:47:43,437 --> 00:47:45,317
鮑伯？
Dr Hoak?

449
00:47:45,397 --> 00:47:47,317
你認識他？
You knew him?

450
00:47:48,527 --> 00:47:51,527
魚類研究是一個很小的領域
Fish genetics is a very small field.

451
00:47:51,737 --> 00:47:54,407
你們是朋友嗎？
You were friends?

452
00:47:55,827 --> 00:47:59,537
我們比朋友的關係更密切些
Let's say we were  a great deal more than that.

453
00:48:01,327 --> 00:48:03,497
你在為他隱瞞真相
You're covering up.

454
00:48:06,127 --> 00:48:10,297
你是華克斯曼嗎？你是不是擔心軍隊會除掉你
Is it Waxman? Are you afraid of what  the army might do to you if you...

455
00:48:10,717 --> 00:48:15,007
不是怕，我是科學家，我是我們部門的領導
No, I'm not afraid. I'm a scientist.  I'm head of my department.

456
00:48:15,297 --> 00:48:18,507
是個很重要的部門
It's just that there are priorities, and...

457
00:48:20,217 --> 00:48:23,017
有的東西比幾條人命更重要
some things are more important  than a few lives.

458
00:48:23,597 --> 00:48:27,227
浩克教授可不這麼想
That's not how Dr Hoak felt.  Not at the end.

459
00:48:28,897 --> 00:48:31,607
至少他在生命的最後一刻不是
As I said, he was a dreamer.

460
00:48:33,027 --> 00:48:36,527
- 我剛才說過，他是個夢想家 - 嘿，等等
- The situation is under control.  - Hold on. What is this?

461
00:48:36,817 --> 00:48:39,037
為何你不聽我說呢？
Why won't you listen to me?

462
00:48:39,197 --> 00:48:42,117
你能不能出去一下？
Would you excuse us  for a moment, please?

463
00:48:43,327 --> 00:48:46,707
對於你來說，格羅根先生，這個實驗項目不存在
As far as you're concerned,  this project does not exist.

464
00:48:46,997 --> 00:48:49,417
食人魚不存在，知道嗎？
The piranha do not exist.

465
00:48:49,627 --> 00:48:51,707
- 如果我抗議呢？ - 保羅...
Paul...  - And if I make a squawk?  - Paul...

466
00:48:51,917 --> 00:48:55,127
國家安全部門會被迫採取極端的措施
The interests of national security  permit extreme measures.

467
00:48:55,297 --> 00:48:57,927
得了吧，戰爭已經結束了
Oh, come on! The war's over, dammit!

468
00:48:58,217 --> 00:49:00,717
格羅根先生，還會有別的戰爭
There'll be other wars, Mr Grogan.

469
00:49:02,017 --> 00:49:06,517
我想，為了你們自己的安全 你們呆在帳篷裡，哪兒也別去
I think for your own protection  we'd better secure your tent for the night.

470
00:49:10,607 --> 00:49:12,897
- 出什麼事了嗎？ - 怎麼了？
- Look who's here.  - What's goin' on?

471
00:49:13,237 --> 00:49:14,897
沒事
Nothin'.

472
00:49:24,327 --> 00:49:26,707
他還守著嗎？
Psst! Is he still out there?

473
00:49:26,997 --> 00:49:28,207
對
Yep.

474
00:49:28,497 --> 00:49:30,627
- 你去分散他的注意力 - 為什麼？
- Then you'll have to distract him.  - Why?

475
00:49:30,837 --> 00:49:34,417
- 我可以逃跑 - 你可以逃跑，那我呢？
- So I can get away.  - So you can get away? What about me?

476
00:49:34,627 --> 00:49:38,217
- 隨便，但首先，你要分散他的注意力 - 怎麼分散呢？
- Suit yourself. But first you distract him.  - How?

477
00:49:38,507 --> 00:49:43,427
我怎麼知道？你想辦法讓他背對著帳篷門口，快點
How would I know? Just get him with  his back to the opening. Come on to him.

478
00:49:48,017 --> 00:49:50,107
萬一他是同性戀呢？
What if he's gay?

479
00:49:50,397 --> 00:49:52,897
那就我來分散注意力
Then I'll distract him. Let's go.

480
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,697
嗨
Hi.

481
00:49:59,407 --> 00:50:01,407
嗯
Uh...

482
00:50:01,617 --> 00:50:03,537
今晚真不錯
Nice night, huh?

483
00:50:05,037 --> 00:50:07,497
- 請問，你是同性戀嗎？ - 什麼？
- Listen, are you gay?  - What?

484
00:50:08,497 --> 00:50:09,997
哦
Oh...

485
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:14,417
我剛才在雜誌上閱讀相關的文章
Well, I was just reading  this article in this magazine, and...

486
00:50:14,797 --> 00:50:17,927
- 你剛才問我什麼？ - 看！天上！
- What did you ask me before?  - Look! Up in the sky!

487
00:50:18,427 --> 00:50:20,137
超人來了！
It's Superman!

488
00:50:27,227 --> 00:50:29,097
哦，糟糕
Oh, shit!

489
00:50:29,437 --> 00:50:31,397
- 怎麼了？ - 身上有五毛錢嗎？
- What's wrong?  - Have you got a dime?

490
00:50:43,027 --> 00:50:44,827
喂？
Hello?

491
00:50:45,037 --> 00:50:48,407
怎麼了？你說什麼？
What? What piranhas?  What are you talking about?

492
00:50:49,707 --> 00:50:51,127
什麼？
What?

493
00:50:51,417 --> 00:50:53,707
你瘋了嗎？是誰啊？
Are you crazy? Who is this?

494
00:50:53,997 --> 00:50:58,927
哦，格羅根，我記起來了，你不是瘋了，你是喝多了
Oh, Grogan. Yeah, I remember you.  You're not crazy, you're drunk.

495
00:50:59,217 --> 00:51:02,927
不，我不想對她說，她和你一樣酩酊大醉
No, I don't wanna talk to her.  I'm sure she's as drunk as you are.

496
00:51:03,137 --> 00:51:05,717
你在那兒等著，我叫警察過來幫你
You wake me up again,  I'll have the cops on you.

497
00:51:06,097 --> 00:51:09,227
什麼？你不能和你女兒談話
What? No, you can't talk to your daughter.

498
00:51:09,437 --> 00:51:11,807
掛了吧，格羅根，我要睡覺！
Sober up, Grogan, and fly right!

499
00:51:17,107 --> 00:51:18,397
食人魚！
Piranhas!

500
00:51:19,397 --> 00:51:21,407
- 混蛋！ - 他不相信你說的
- Asshole!  - He didn't believe you.

501
00:51:21,607 --> 00:51:24,697
- 他以為我喝多了 - 能和你女兒通話嗎？
- He thinks I'm drunk.  - Can you get through to your daughter?

502
00:51:24,907 --> 00:51:27,327
不能，我們得走了
No way. We gotta get down there.

503
00:51:56,817 --> 00:51:58,737
保羅,他們在追我們
Paul, behind us.

504
00:51:59,027 --> 00:52:02,317
這次我們逃不掉了
I know. No way we can  outrun him in this thing.

505
00:52:02,697 --> 00:52:05,117
也許我們可以找他們談一談 可能他們會信我們的
Maybe we can talk to him.  Maybe he'll believe us.

506
00:52:06,617 --> 00:52:10,037
食人魚，嗯？它們從哪兒來的？
Piranha, huh?  And where did they come from?

507
00:52:10,407 --> 00:52:12,827
從山上軍方的試驗池塘裡出來的
From an army test site  up on the mountain.

508
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:15,337
只有個哨所在那兒，沒有軍隊
That's posted. There's no trespassing.

509
00:52:15,627 --> 00:52:18,797
不是哨所，已經有兩個人在池塘裡死了 河裡又死了四個
Two people were killed up there,  and more along the river.

510
00:52:19,207 --> 00:52:20,797
你必須相信我們
You've gotta believe us.

511
00:52:21,007 --> 00:52:24,427
不大可能吧，你不是叫格羅根嗎？
Now wait. Say, aren't you Grogan?

512
00:52:24,717 --> 00:52:27,427
- 對 - 我記起來了
- Yeah, that's right.  - Uh-huh. I remember.

513
00:52:27,597 --> 00:52:30,307
你上個月喝醉酒開車，我們抓到過你
We had you in on  a drunk and disorderly last month.

514
00:52:30,597 --> 00:52:35,227
可我現在沒醉！你可以對我做酒精測試 請你聽我說好不好？
I am not drunk! You give me a breath test,  whatever you want, only listen to me!

515
00:52:35,607 --> 00:52:39,227
你可以到警察局去測
I think I'm gonna take you up on that,  buddy. Back to the station.

516
00:52:39,527 --> 00:52:42,737
這次你可以好好交代一下了
And you can explain why  you're in an army staff car.

517
00:52:43,027 --> 00:52:47,697
千萬不要動怒，因為我有槍
And don't you get any notion, man,  cos I got my gun in my other hand here.

518
00:52:48,027 --> 00:52:49,327
好嗎？
OK?

519
00:52:49,537 --> 00:52:51,827
我們走，快點
Okey-dokey. Let's go.

520
00:52:56,827 --> 00:52:58,707
我們這兒有情況
Yes. We've got a situation up here.

521
00:52:58,997 --> 00:53:03,297
是非常棘手的情況，你必須幫我控制一下局面
A very delicate situation. And you can  help us control it by holding them for us.

522
00:53:04,007 --> 00:53:07,927
我明白，我會的
Yes, Colonel. Yes, yes.  I understand. We'll do it.

523
00:53:08,297 --> 00:53:10,927
不要讓他們與外面接觸
Make sure they don't  communicate with the outside.

524
00:53:11,097 --> 00:53:13,307
以免引起不必要的麻煩
We're tryin' to avoid unnecessary panic.

525
00:53:13,517 --> 00:53:14,517
當然
Certainly.

526
00:53:15,307 --> 00:53:17,897
為了公眾的利益，我知道
Their best interests, I agree.

527
00:53:19,317 --> 00:53:21,727
遵命
Well, you're welcome, Colonel. Uh...

528
00:53:27,527 --> 00:53:29,827
明早見
See you in the mornin'.

529
00:53:39,837 --> 00:53:44,297
今晚你們得在這兒過夜了，你們好好待著吧
Well, you best make yourself comfortable,  folks. You'll be spending the night.

530
00:53:44,627 --> 00:53:48,297
- 可以打電話嗎？ - 這裡可不行
- What about a phone call?  - I don't wanna hear it.

531
00:53:48,507 --> 00:53:50,427
我不能再讓你們惹出什麼亂子
I don't wanna hear it.

532
00:53:50,717 --> 00:53:53,017
你們還是老老實實呆著
I gotta get back on that road now.

533
00:53:53,307 --> 00:53:56,597
再見了，夥計們，明早見
So you folks, you just behave yourselves.

534
00:53:56,937 --> 00:53:59,727
等一下，你不能就這樣走
No, wait a minute. You can't just leave!

535
00:54:00,017 --> 00:54:02,527
我女兒在那邊！
My daughter's down there!

536
00:54:02,727 --> 00:54:06,527
孩子們還都在河邊！
There are kids down there,  and the piranhas are in the river!

537
00:54:07,607 --> 00:54:08,817
求你了！
Please!

538
00:54:09,317 --> 00:54:14,907
惡魔們散佈在教堂四周
The witch and the demons of the forest  scoured every corner of the church,

539
00:54:15,197 --> 00:54:18,827
毒液從它們的毒牙上直往下滴
venom dripping from their fangs.

540
00:54:19,127 --> 00:54:22,837
巫婆說「你們在哪裡啊？」
"Where is he?" hissed the witch.

541
00:54:23,917 --> 00:54:28,637
惡魔說，把眼皮向上拉
The demons peeled  their heavy eyelids back.

542
00:54:33,217 --> 00:54:34,307
它們來了！
There he is!

543
00:54:38,017 --> 00:54:42,227
There's absolutely no cause for alarm. It's a complete hoax, believe me.

544
00:54:42,397 --> 00:54:43,897
Yeah.

545
00:54:44,227 --> 00:54:48,107
我要提醒你一件事情，可能會出現沒有根據的恐慌
I just wanted to warn you in case  they were able to get a call through.

546
00:54:48,397 --> 00:54:51,527
它會毀了我們隆重的開業慶典
Groundless panic wouldn't help  our grand opening any.

547
00:54:52,117 --> 00:54:56,697
我很感謝你的提醒，我會對我手下的員工們說清楚的
Uh-huh. I really appreciate the warning.  I'll brief my staff. We'll take care of it.

548
00:54:58,207 --> 00:55:00,117
是的，您不用擔心
Yeah. Don't worry.

549
00:55:01,497 --> 00:55:04,917
隨便說一句，明天您過來吧
Uh-huh. By the way,  are you comin' down tomorrow?

550
00:55:05,707 --> 00:55:09,507
很好，很好，您的光臨會給慶典增添光彩
Ah, good. Your presence will lend  a certain prestige to the opening.

551
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:11,137
Mm-hm.

552
00:55:11,217 --> 00:55:12,637
Huh?

553
00:55:15,717 --> 00:55:19,097
沒人知道這裡有您的投資
No. No, Colonel.  Nobody knows about your investment.

554
00:55:20,937 --> 00:55:23,397
只有另外幾個秘密的合夥投資人
With me, a silent partner's  privacy is sacred.

555
00:55:23,607 --> 00:55:27,107
他們不參與管理，我向您發誓沒人知道
I swear to you on my honour  as a Texan, nobody knows.

556
00:55:28,897 --> 00:55:30,407
是的，將軍
Yes, Colonel.

557
00:55:30,607 --> 00:55:33,027
晚安，晚安
Good night. Good night.

558
00:55:33,827 --> 00:55:35,537
大蠢蛋！
Schmuck!

559
00:55:37,197 --> 00:55:41,617
加點速度，夥計們，我們要在七點之前全部完成
Come on, you guys! Will you haul ass?  This stuff's gotta be set by ten o'clock.

560
00:55:42,417 --> 00:55:44,997
你在那兒幹什麼？
What are you doing back there?

561
00:55:45,207 --> 00:55:47,507
不是抽煙就是喝酒
Hide, that's all they do.  Drink beer and hide.

562
00:55:58,807 --> 00:56:00,517
- 嗨  - 嗨
- Hi.  - Hi.

563
00:56:04,517 --> 00:56:06,397
我很喜歡這樣的夜晚
I always like it at night.

564
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:08,527
是啊，我也一樣
Yeah, me too.

565
00:56:09,107 --> 00:56:11,317
一切都沉寂了
It's like it's resting.

566
00:56:11,527 --> 00:56:14,407
- 嘿，想下水游泳嗎？ - 大晚上游泳？
- Hey, wanna race me across?  - To the island?

567
00:56:14,697 --> 00:56:18,327
是啊，我一到這兒就想晚上一個人下水游泳
Yeah. Ever since I got here, I haven't  been able to just swim by myself.

568
00:56:18,697 --> 00:56:22,617
周圍靜悄悄的，感覺真好
I've always had half a dozen  campers hangin' on to me.

569
00:56:22,917 --> 00:56:26,627
我不怎麼喜歡晚上游泳，不過我喜歡看
I don't know. I don't feel like swimming.  But go ahead, I'll watch you.

570
00:56:29,207 --> 00:56:32,217
- 你怕什麼呢？ - 我不知道
- What's the matter?  - I don't know.

571
00:56:32,627 --> 00:56:35,007
有些事情…有些事情不太對勁
Something... Something's wrong.

572
00:56:36,507 --> 00:56:39,307
來吧，和我一塊兒下水吧，對身體有好處的
Come on, come with me.  It'll do you some good.

573
00:56:39,517 --> 00:56:42,307
- 也許你是對的 - 行了，我們下水吧
- You're probably right.  - Good. OK.

574
00:56:43,517 --> 00:56:45,397
格羅根夫人，你們在幹什麼！
Grogan, turn off that flashlight!

575
00:56:46,107 --> 00:56:48,107
別害怕，就我一個人
Don't be alarmed - it's only me.

576
00:56:48,607 --> 00:56:51,817
有謠言說夏令營裡有人半夜三更到這兒來游泳
There's a rumour some campers  are coming for a midnight swim.

577
00:56:52,237 --> 00:56:55,907
如果被我抓住的話她們就慘了
If I catch them swimming, they'll be  in pretty hot water, I can tell you.

578
00:56:56,197 --> 00:56:58,827
- 那麼剛才在幹什麼？ - 我們只是…
- What are you doing out here?  - Oh, well, we...

579
00:56:59,197 --> 00:57:02,407
我們剛才好像聽見有營員來游水
I thought I heard some campers  swimming. We came down to look.

580
00:57:02,907 --> 00:57:05,707
- 游泳？在哪兒？ - 在瀑布邊
- Swimming? Where?  - Over by the waterfall.

581
00:57:06,207 --> 00:57:08,497
瀑布邊？是在那邊嗎？
The waterfall?  Is that where they're doing it?

582
00:57:08,707 --> 00:57:10,417
那是什麼？
- What was that?

583
00:57:10,627 --> 00:57:13,627
是湖的那邊游泳的人發出的聲音
It sounded like campers  on the other side of the lake.

584
00:57:14,297 --> 00:57:16,507
湖的那邊？
The other side of the lake?

585
00:57:17,637 --> 00:57:21,307
多謝，給我上來，你們…
Thank you. Kim Burrell, is that you?

586
00:57:24,727 --> 00:57:27,517
看來只好等到明天了
Well, there's always  tomorrow for that swim.

587
00:57:27,727 --> 00:57:30,107
是啊，明天再說吧
Yeah. Let's do it tomorrow.

588
00:57:45,827 --> 00:57:48,917
- 你在幹什麼？ - 有人教過我一招，我想用一下
- What are you doin'?  - Did I tell you about Mo Schneider?

589
00:57:49,707 --> 00:57:53,627
- 是誰？ - 以前認識的一個越獄慣犯
- Who's that?  - This guy they sent me to find one time.

590
00:57:54,297 --> 00:57:59,137
他是個水管工，他以不雅的身體暴露被拘留了
He was a plumber. He kept running off  and getting busted for indecent exposure.

591
00:58:04,427 --> 00:58:06,307
嘿，你在那兒幹什麼？
What are you doin' there?

592
00:58:06,727 --> 00:58:10,607
因為行為不檢點，他被拘留多次
Mo was in the poky so many times that  he developed a regular escape routine.

593
00:58:10,897 --> 00:58:13,397
逃跑的技巧越來越高，這是一個水管工的絕招
Being a plumber,  he used what he knew best.

594
00:58:16,607 --> 00:58:18,817
怎麼回事？
What the hell was that?

595
00:58:19,617 --> 00:58:22,407
你在幹什麼？你沒事吧？
What are you doing? Are you all right?

596
00:58:23,697 --> 00:58:25,037
老天！聽著…
Christ, listen.

597
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:29,497
你這個計劃會有用嗎？
This, uh, this plan,  whatever it is, did it ever work?

598
00:58:29,827 --> 00:58:33,207
你一會就知道了
No. But he came pretty  close a couple of times.

599
00:58:35,007 --> 00:58:37,717
只要看門的人會進來
Pretty damn close.

600
00:58:40,927 --> 00:58:46,097
怎麼回事？聽起來像是天花板掉了 滿地的水是怎麼回事？
What's all that racket? Sounds like the  roof fell in. What's all this water from?

601
00:58:46,517 --> 00:58:49,937
管道洩露了
Something's leaking,  and I'll catch pneumonia if it doesn't stop.

602
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:53,227
- 那水管子怎麼了？ - 我試了好幾次
- What's the matter with that sink trap?  - I've tried,

603
00:58:53,397 --> 00:58:56,897
可是力氣不夠放不回去
but I'm just not strong enough  to put the pipes back together.

604
00:58:57,237 --> 00:59:00,027
你往後退，我進來看看
All right. Stand back, I'll take a look at it.

605
00:59:07,827 --> 00:59:12,127
這是怎麼回事？是出水管的問題嗎？
What the hell did you do to this thing?  Tryin' to crawl through the drainpipe?

606
00:59:20,927 --> 00:59:23,927
- 怎麼了？發生什麼事了？ - 他只是暈過去了，還活著
- What's happenin'?  - He's knocked out, but he's alive.

607
00:59:24,097 --> 00:59:26,927
快拿鑰匙，有鑰匙嗎？
Get his keys. Can you get his keys?

608
00:59:27,227 --> 00:59:31,097
- 與褲子繫在一起 - 那麼把褲子脫下來吧
- They're chained to his pants!  - Well, take his pants off, then.

609
00:59:42,117 --> 00:59:46,537
你脫男人褲子不會這麼慢吧？
Come on. I'd have thought you could  get a man's pants off quicker than that.

610
00:59:52,417 --> 00:59:55,127
好了，我拿到了！
Got 'em! I got 'em!

611
00:59:55,837 --> 00:59:58,207
好，我們走
Come on. Let's go.

612
01:00:00,427 --> 01:00:03,637
- 你用什麼打的他？ - 一個水龍頭
- What did you hit him with?  - A piece of the toilet lid.

613
01:00:03,927 --> 01:00:07,307
- 這次可又是我的功勞啊 - 感謝你的那個暴露狂師傅
- Maybe I should have tried bribery first.  - Thank you, Mo Schneider.

614
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:10,937
你真是他的好學生
Don't suppose one of those  keys would fit a patrol car?

615
01:00:11,097 --> 01:00:13,517
我們又自由了
I wouldn't be surprised.

616
01:01:01,237 --> 01:01:03,697
歡迎今天來的所有客人
Howdy, folks. I'm Buck Gardner.

617
01:01:05,027 --> 01:01:06,527
謝謝大家
Thank you.

618
01:01:12,117 --> 01:01:13,827
謝謝，謝謝大家
Thank you. I appreciate that.

619
01:01:14,617 --> 01:01:18,337
這個大家等待已經久的度假村
On behalf of Buck Gardner's  Aquarena Development Corporation,

620
01:01:18,707 --> 01:01:23,127
今天終於開張了
it gives me great pleasure to invite you  here to our opening-day festivities.

621
01:01:25,797 --> 01:01:29,097
這個地區是非常引人入勝的，我們有眾多娛樂節目
If you have any questions about  purchasing land up here,

622
01:01:29,427 --> 01:01:33,307
大家可以盡情享受
our people will be mingling in the crowd  to answer your questions.

623
01:01:33,597 --> 01:01:38,397
沒有必要買任何東西 大家只管玩就行了
You got no obligation to buy anything,  only to enjoy yourselves. Annie?

624
01:01:42,527 --> 01:01:44,107
來吧
Right there.

625
01:01:44,397 --> 01:01:46,107
剪吧
Right there.

626
01:01:47,617 --> 01:01:49,027
再試試
Try again.

627
01:01:49,197 --> 01:01:50,907
剪的真好，孩子
Nice try, kid.

628
01:01:51,697 --> 01:01:53,327
行了！
That's it!

629
01:01:55,917 --> 01:01:59,837
不要忘了，我們有免費燒烤，中午一點鐘開始
Don't forget, free barbecue  this afternoon at one o'clock.

630
01:02:00,127 --> 01:02:01,837
大家盡情享受吧
Enjoy yourselves.

631
01:02:02,797 --> 01:02:04,217
蠻成功的
We got 'em.

632
01:02:08,507 --> 01:02:11,807
別看了！只看不練的小鬼
No comics! No comics. No discipline.

633
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:20,317
水上競賽時間到了，大家放下弓箭
Water competition.  Muster up. Water competition.

634
01:02:20,517 --> 01:02:23,227
換上游泳衣到河邊去
Put the arrows away.  Put the bows in the tep...

635
01:02:33,197 --> 01:02:34,537
這不好笑
That isn't funny.

636
01:02:35,907 --> 01:02:37,827
快來！快
Minnows, over here!

637
01:02:38,117 --> 01:02:39,997
快點兒，孩子們
Come on, kids.

638
01:02:41,997 --> 01:02:43,917
快點，你們這些小傢伙
Come on, you guys.

639
01:02:44,507 --> 01:02:49,427
孩子們，到這兒來，孩子們，快過來，快點
Guppies! Come on, let's go!  Come on, line up. That's right. Come on.

640
01:02:49,797 --> 01:02:52,427
過來排隊，大家站好
Standing in line. Straight line.

641
01:02:53,717 --> 01:02:57,517
分成兩隊，我們來高呼，我們一定贏
Straighten up. OK. We're gonna  have a tube race. Who's gonna win?

642
01:02:57,807 --> 01:03:00,017
- 一定能贏 - 一定能贏！
- Minnows!  - We are!

643
01:03:00,307 --> 01:03:02,107
我們要贏！
We are!

644
01:03:02,317 --> 01:03:04,727
好啦，你們這些傢伙
All right. OK, you guys.

645
01:03:04,897 --> 01:03:07,737
游泳是不能戴眼鏡的，給我
You cannot swim with your glasses on.

646
01:03:08,027 --> 01:03:10,907
兩人一組，手拉手
Let's turn this way now.  Buddy system. Arms up.

647
01:03:11,117 --> 01:03:13,527
就這樣，很好
There we go. Stand up straight. Come on.

648
01:03:13,827 --> 01:03:17,207
- 站直了 - 真不錯，你就像是一條小孔雀魚
- Stand up straight.  - Come on, be proud you're a Guppy.

649
01:03:19,497 --> 01:03:22,127
很好，很好
That's good. That's good.  Hold your stomach in.

650
01:03:22,417 --> 01:03:25,627
早上好，營員們，找準你們自己的伴兒
Morning, campers.  Fall in back here and buddy up.

651
01:03:25,797 --> 01:03:28,127
杜蒙特先生，我們已經準備好了
Mr Dumont, we're ready for you, sir.

652
01:03:30,927 --> 01:03:32,637
把手放下！
Arms down!

653
01:03:34,097 --> 01:03:37,727
現在我們要看看誰是兔子，誰是烏龜
All right now. This is where we separate  the tortoises from the hares,

654
01:03:38,017 --> 01:03:42,307
誰會像下沉的木頭，誰才是真正的游泳健將
the wheat from the chaff,  and the sinkers from the swimmers.

655
01:03:43,817 --> 01:03:45,527
水是鹹的
Salt water.

656
01:03:45,817 --> 01:03:48,527
- 什麼？ - 我記得水是鹹的
- What?  - I just remembered. It was salt water.

657
01:03:48,817 --> 01:03:51,607
- 什麼時候？ - 試驗湖的池塘裡
- What was?  - ln the pond at the test site.

658
01:03:52,027 --> 01:03:54,827
- 我差點忘了 - 那又怎樣？
- I thought it was strange, then I forgot.  - So?

659
01:03:55,827 --> 01:03:59,907
而食人魚是淡水魚，這就是說，浩克開發出來的魚種
Piranha are freshwater fish.  Hoak must have developed a strain

660
01:04:00,327 --> 01:04:03,127
在鹹水和淡水都能存活，和大馬哈魚一樣
that can live both in fresh and salt.  Like salmon.

661
01:04:06,497 --> 01:04:09,797
- 所以它們想進入大海 - 它們會進入大海嗎？
- That's why they headed downstream.  - And if they get to the ocean?

662
01:04:10,427 --> 01:04:14,507
它們沒別的目標，它們將游經整個國家的河流
There'll be no way to contain 'em. They'll  be able to swim up every river system.

663
01:04:40,617 --> 01:04:43,417
你在幹什麼？你應該下水游泳
What are you doing?  You should be in that race.

664
01:04:43,997 --> 01:04:46,837
- 可媽媽說… - 我不要聽任何理由
- But Betsy told me...  - I don't want to hear any excuses.

665
01:04:47,127 --> 01:04:49,797
- 換上泳衣，老老實實過去 - 可我的膝蓋
- Get a tube and get out there.  - But I hurt my knee.

666
01:04:50,007 --> 01:04:51,717
值得懷疑，營員！
On the double, camper!

667
01:05:02,097 --> 01:05:04,017
聽著，孩子們，聽著！
Listen up, you kids!

668
01:05:04,227 --> 01:05:06,727
我們馬上就要開始比賽了
We're gonna start  the tube race in a minute.

669
01:05:07,017 --> 01:05:09,527
兩一組接力賽！
Kathryn! McCarthy! MacBride!

670
01:05:09,897 --> 01:05:12,317
全部過來集中一下
All you campers, come in here.  You're too far out.

671
01:05:16,197 --> 01:05:18,407
混蛋，怎麼開車的
Goddamn Sunday driver.

672
01:05:35,427 --> 01:05:36,637
預備？
Ready?

673
01:05:55,317 --> 01:05:57,697
加油啊！夥計們
Come on! This is a race, people!

674
01:06:27,807 --> 01:06:31,727
賈可布森，再快一點，帕金森，加油啊
Jacobson, put a little muscle in it!  Parkinson, a little effort!

675
01:07:03,097 --> 01:07:05,807
孩子們，使出你們的解數吧！
Kids, let's get a little leg action!

676
01:07:20,197 --> 01:07:21,817
怎麼回事？
What's the matter?

677
01:07:23,327 --> 01:07:25,117
那是什麼？
What is that?

678
01:09:53,727 --> 01:09:57,017
- 蘇珊 ！ 蘇珊 ,快回去，回去啊 - 快上船
- Suzie! Suzie, no. Go back! Go back!  - Get on the boat.

679
01:10:18,127 --> 01:10:19,627
貝琪 ！
Betsy!

680
01:10:24,717 --> 01:10:25,507
貝琪 ！
Betsy!

681
01:10:50,697 --> 01:10:51,697
蘇珊 ！
Suzie!

682
01:10:52,327 --> 01:10:54,117
爸爸
Daddy!

683
01:10:55,197 --> 01:10:59,917
那兒有電話，你給度假村打電話
There's a phone in there. Call the resort  and warn 'em. I'll get the kids out.

684
01:11:06,927 --> 01:11:11,507
接線生，給我阿普裡那溫泉度假村的電話
Operator, get me the number  of the Aquarena Springs Resort.

685
01:11:11,797 --> 01:11:13,507
查電話號碼簿
Look in the phone book.

686
01:11:13,807 --> 01:11:18,097
慢慢享用，請隨意，今天的一切都是免費的
Enjoy yourself. Enjoy yourself.  Everything's free today. Enjoy yourself.

687
01:11:18,437 --> 01:11:20,397
祝你玩的開心
Keep 'em moving, Terry.

688
01:11:23,227 --> 01:11:25,607
孩子，到一邊玩去
Wrong away, kid. This is the exit.

689
01:11:29,027 --> 01:11:31,317
- 嘿，寶貝 - 加德納先生，有你的電話
- Hey, baby.  - Mr Gardner? Mr Gardner?

690
01:11:31,527 --> 01:11:33,907
- 是誰？ - 她說非常重要
- What is it?  - Real important.

691
01:11:35,537 --> 01:11:38,327
- 我是加德納 - 現在聽我說
- Buck Gardner.  - Now listen to me.

692
01:11:38,497 --> 01:11:42,417
這不是玩笑電話 有緊急情況
This is not a crank call.  I am completely serious.

693
01:11:44,497 --> 01:11:45,507
緊急情況？
Emergency?

694
01:11:46,297 --> 01:11:48,507
別緊張，別緊張
Easy. Easy.

695
01:11:48,797 --> 01:11:51,007
我抱住你了
I got you. I got you.

696
01:11:51,297 --> 01:11:53,217
沒事了
All right.

697
01:11:53,717 --> 01:11:56,307
求你了，你一定要相信我說的
Please. Please, you've gotta believe me.

698
01:11:57,807 --> 01:12:01,307
- 謝謝你 - 聽我說，求你了…
- Thank you.  - Listen to me! Please, before it's...

699
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:04,017
謝謝你，食人魚
Thank you. Piranha.

700
01:12:19,117 --> 01:12:23,417
- 和同伴手牽手  - 我們要去另外一個地方
- They're sending an ambulance.  - We gotta drive to the resort ourselves.

701
01:12:23,627 --> 01:12:26,917
- 你自己能頂住嗎？ - 我沒事
- Can you handle this?  - Uh, yeah. I think so.

702
01:12:37,307 --> 01:12:40,017
親愛的，我們很快就回來
Honey, I'll be back  for you real soon, I promise.

703
01:12:40,307 --> 01:12:43,017
呆在這兒好嗎？
So you be brave, huh? Help out here?

704
01:12:45,897 --> 01:12:47,897
真是我的好女兒
That's my girl.

705
01:12:56,027 --> 01:12:58,117
沒事的，蘇珊
It's OK, Suzie.

706
01:12:58,407 --> 01:13:00,327
他們會回來的
He'll be back.

707
01:13:36,617 --> 01:13:40,117
這片海岸到處都可以游泳，去吧
We got plenty of targets.  Yes, sir. Right over there.

708
01:13:51,707 --> 01:13:54,427
順便問一下，先生
By the way, sir, they've noticed.

709
01:13:54,627 --> 01:13:57,637
有個女人說，你曾經在佛羅里達一艘潛艇裡工作
One woman recognised  the submarine ride from Florida.

710
01:13:57,797 --> 01:14:00,517
這個國家什麼地方我沒去過
Of course she did.  I picked it up second-hand.

711
01:14:00,807 --> 01:14:05,097
屠宰場，軍隊都留下了我的足跡
Skyway's from Redondo Beach.  Boathouse is army surplus.

712
01:14:05,517 --> 01:14:08,017
紅鶴是從愛達荷州弄來的
Dancing chickens?  From a carnival in ldaho.

713
01:14:08,307 --> 01:14:10,817
天鵝是從亞特蘭大弄來的
Ralph the Swimming Swine?  From Atlantic City.

714
01:14:11,027 --> 01:14:14,237
看來你這個度假村的東西都是一流的
They're saying, for a new resort,  nothing's looking very new.

715
01:14:14,527 --> 01:14:18,407
那當然，那些都是國家一級保護動物
What do they know? Ralph the Swimming  Swine's practically a national monument.

716
01:14:18,827 --> 01:14:21,537
不過我不光是為了賺錢，是為了讓大家玩的開心點
He's been swimming for  more years than I can remember.

717
01:14:21,697 --> 01:14:26,207
你看這種建築對大眾有什麼作用？
The other stuff they just don't make. That  submarine ride is a piece of Americana.

718
01:14:26,497 --> 01:14:27,997
是的
Yes, sir.

719
01:14:28,127 --> 01:14:30,837
- 可用的卻是大家的錢 - 我不知道
- Maybe they never heard of recycling.  - I don't know.

720
01:14:31,127 --> 01:14:35,297
笑一個，我們還有活動，你好，參議員
Smile, we're goin' public.  Hello, Senator. How are you?

721
01:14:45,437 --> 01:14:48,437
如果媒體知道，我們倆都完了
If they get to the media,  we're both screwed.

722
01:14:51,517 --> 01:14:54,737
華克斯曼上校，梅克斯博士，歡迎你們的光臨
Colonel Waxman. Dr Mengers.  What a pleasant surprise.

723
01:14:54,897 --> 01:14:56,907
他們逃跑了
They busted jail.

724
01:15:00,617 --> 01:15:02,827
- 他們已經打過電話來了 - 你的手下都準備好了嗎？
- They already called.  - Is your staff ready?

725
01:15:03,037 --> 01:15:05,407
我想您能不能給您在本地媒體機構的熟人打個電話
- They're all set.  - Call your local newspaper.

726
01:15:05,707 --> 01:15:07,997
讓他們不要大肆宣傳這件事
Warn 'em they might get  some crank calls.

727
01:15:08,207 --> 01:15:11,337
- 讓他們把信息封鎖一段時間 - 你知道該怎麼做，趕快去
- Wouldn't it be better...  - You got your orders. Hop to it.

728
01:15:11,497 --> 01:15:14,127
上校，那些謠言我已經聽到了 我知道該怎麼處理
Cool it with the military crap.  I'll take care of it.

729
01:15:14,417 --> 01:15:16,927
跟我走，我馬上去辦
Whitney? Let's hop to it.

730
01:15:21,717 --> 01:15:25,097
- 華克斯曼上將，好久不見了 - 是上校，夫人
- General Waxman, it's been so long.  - It's Colonel, ma'am.

731
01:15:25,427 --> 01:15:28,307
還是上校嗎？為什麼？
Colonel, still? Oh, I can't imagine why.

732
01:15:28,597 --> 01:15:30,897
政治需要，夫人，政治需要
Politics, ma'am. Politics.

733
01:15:34,317 --> 01:15:36,027
笨蛋一個
Stupid cow.

734
01:15:49,617 --> 01:15:51,627
- 準備好了嗎？ - 好了
- Ready?  - OK.

735
01:17:26,137 --> 01:17:28,507
嘿，他滑的可真不賴
Hey, he really does ski great.

736
01:17:33,937 --> 01:17:37,317
- 他在表現他自己 - 他總這樣
- He's such a show-off.  - He thinks he's such hot shit.

737
01:17:37,607 --> 01:17:41,317
- 也許我們可以再開快點 - 好
- Maybe we're not going fast enough.  - I can fix that.

738
01:18:05,007 --> 01:18:07,217
等一下！那兒有什麼東西
Hold it! There's something back here!

739
01:18:09,717 --> 01:18:12,307
停下！馬上停下
Take it in! Now!

740
01:18:14,017 --> 01:18:17,727
- 嘿，好像有問題啊 - 是啊，他有點吃不消了
- I think something's wrong.  - Yeah, we haven't dumped him yet.

741
01:18:31,327 --> 01:18:32,327
停下！
Stop!

742
01:18:36,707 --> 01:18:41,337
有情況！那裡有問題，快點！停下它
Take me in! There's something in here!  Come on! Get me outta here!

743
01:18:41,707 --> 01:18:43,507
減速，停下
Slow down. Stop!

744
01:18:45,507 --> 01:18:48,217
加速，別停下
Faster! Don't stop!

745
01:18:49,927 --> 01:18:52,427
- 等等，他到底… - 不！
- Wait. He says...  - No!

746
01:18:53,807 --> 01:18:56,307
加速，快加速
Speed up. Speed up!

747
01:19:00,107 --> 01:19:01,517
停下！
Stop!

748
01:19:44,397 --> 01:19:46,897
啊！啊！ 啊！
Argh! Argh! Argh!

749
01:20:39,997 --> 01:20:41,617
糟了！
Dammit!

750
01:20:46,417 --> 01:20:49,127
沒有，波比，一切正常
No, Bob. It's completely false.

751
01:20:49,297 --> 01:20:52,217
你應該相信我
There's not a word  of truth to it, believe me.

752
01:20:52,507 --> 01:20:54,427
- 先生 - 我在接電話
- Sir?  - I'm on the phone!

753
01:20:54,797 --> 01:20:56,097
食人魚
Piranhas.

754
01:20:56,307 --> 01:20:58,517
- 不是說了別相信這東西 - 但是食人魚…
- Don't even say that word!  - But the piranhas...

755
01:20:58,807 --> 01:21:01,937
- 食人魚怎麼啦？ - 食人魚在吃我們的客人
- What about the piranhas?  - They're eating the guests, sir.

756
01:21:08,227 --> 01:21:09,607
哦...
Uh...

757
01:21:09,817 --> 01:21:15,027
鮑伯，我要回去了，這邊出了點小問題
Bob, I'm gonna have to get back to you on  this. We've got a... a situation down here.

758
01:22:03,207 --> 01:22:05,707
快點，快上來！
Come on. Get off! You'll tip us over.

759
01:22:14,717 --> 01:22:15,797
上來！
Get off!

760
01:22:29,897 --> 01:22:31,817
該死，快上來！
Dammit, get off!

761
01:24:16,507 --> 01:24:18,417
我們去哪兒？
Where are we going?

762
01:24:18,627 --> 01:24:21,717
我原來那個工廠的排水口
The lake narrows where  the outlet for the refinery was.

763
01:24:21,927 --> 01:24:24,717
在冶煉爐裡還有很多廢水
They'll be bunched tight  when they come through there.

764
01:24:25,007 --> 01:24:26,097
然後呢？
What then?

765
01:24:26,427 --> 01:24:30,807
如果那些廢水還在的話，我們去把它們放出來
If it isn't tapped off, there might be  enough waste left in the smelting tanks.

766
01:24:31,097 --> 01:24:34,017
- 可以殺了食人魚嗎？ - 可以毒死一切
- It'll kill the fish?  - It'll kill anything.

767
01:24:34,227 --> 01:24:37,027
把食人魚一網打盡
We'll pollute the bastards to death.

768
01:24:46,327 --> 01:24:48,037
哦，老天，不
Oh, Lord. No.

769
01:24:51,117 --> 01:24:53,207
- 怎麼了？ - 漲潮了
- What's wrong?  - It's all flooded.

770
01:24:53,417 --> 01:24:56,127
控制室被淹了
The control booth is underwater.

771
01:24:56,337 --> 01:24:59,297
- 怎麼辦？ - 我們得想想辦法
- What can we do?  - Well, we gotta do somethin'.

772
01:25:00,427 --> 01:25:02,797
- 拖繩在哪兒？ - 在後面
- Where's that towline?  - It's in the back.

773
01:25:08,097 --> 01:25:11,597
我要你開始慢慢的計數，一直數到100
So I want you to start  counting slowly up to 100.

774
01:25:11,807 --> 01:25:16,397
然後，不管我有沒有浮出水面，你加速，把我拉出來
Then, whether I'm up to the surface or  not, hit that throttle and get outta here.

775
01:25:16,817 --> 01:25:21,607
不是說那時候肯定事情已經做好了 而是我只能憋那麼久的氣
If I'm not up by then, I'm in trouble, cos  that's as long as I can hold my breath.

776
01:25:22,107 --> 01:25:25,027
好，開始計數吧
So, let's count it down together.

777

- 好嗎？ - 好吧

789
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:00,517
82！

790
01:28:00,727 --> 01:28:01,727
83！
83.

791
01:28:27,917 --> 01:28:29,127
98！

792
01:28:29,217 --> 01:28:30,637
99！

793
01:28:30,797 --> 01:28:32,507
100！

794
01:29:19,427 --> 01:29:20,517
保羅！
Paul!

795
01:29:21,807 --> 01:29:26,317
迷失河之湖 充滿著恐怖與死亡
Lost River Lake.  Terror, horror, death. Film at 1 1 .

01:30:09,527 --> 01:30:11,817
- 快來人！ - 幫幫忙！
- Medic!  - Help!

797
01:30:14,817 --> 01:30:18,827
你還在拍什麼？還拍什麼啊？
What the hell are you filming?  What the hell are you filming?!

798
01:30:28,707 --> 01:30:31,127
喝一點吧
Try and take some.

799
01:30:32,127 --> 01:30:34,297
給我們介紹一下情況吧，梅克斯博士
Where do we go from here, Dr Mengers?

800
01:30:34,627 --> 01:30:38,427
我們要先進行調查，看應該由誰負責
I'm personally going to head  a full-scale investigation into this incident,

801
01:30:38,717 --> 01:30:43,517
以避免類似的事情再次發生
to discover who was responsible, and  to ensure this could never happen again.

802
01:30:43,807 --> 01:30:49,607
這些食人魚對海洋的生態環境有影響嗎？
As an expert in tropical species,  what danger is there in the possibility of the piranha reaching the ocean?

803
01:30:49,817 --> 01:30:53,397
沒有，現在已經不用擔心了
Oh, none. Most of them Will have  been destroyed by pollution at the lake.

804
01:30:53,607 --> 01:30:57,317
這些魚無法在鹽水中生活
If any did get through, there's no Way  they could survive the salt Water.

805
01:30:58,617 --> 01:31:01,537
現在沒有食人魚了
There's nothing left to fear.
