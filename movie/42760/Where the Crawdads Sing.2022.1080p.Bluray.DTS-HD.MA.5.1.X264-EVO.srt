1
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,572
<i>Marsh is not swamp.</i>

2
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,660
<i>Marsh is a space of light...</i>

3
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:20,122
<i>where grass grows in water...</i>

4
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:23,793
<i>and water flows into the sky.</i>

5
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,715
<i>Then within the marsh, here and there...</i>

6
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,302
<i>true swamp.</i>

7
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:56,469
<i>A swamp knows all about death...</i>

8
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,348
<i>and doesn't necessarily
define it as tragedy.</i>

9
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,808
<i>Certainly not a sin.</i>

10
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:08,147
I thought Chase Andrews
would have more common sense.

11
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,067
Best quarterback this town ever had.

12
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:17,490
Boys, are these your footprints here?

13
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,574
Yes, sir.

14
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,124
Where's his footprints?

15
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:37,968
Yeah, some kids
just get crazy ideas in their heads

16
00:03:38,052 --> 00:03:40,805
and drink and think they're invincible.

17
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,766
That Chase Andrews was no Kid.

18
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,864
Hey. Look at this.

19
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:11,669
- He open the grate himself?
- Could've been an accident, all the same.

20
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,506
Time of death,
between midnight and 2 a.m.

21
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,510
Cause of death,
sudden impact from the 63-foot drop.

22
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:23,681
Since you found that blood
and hair on the support beam,

23
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:27,601
I would deduce that was
the cause of the primary injury.

24
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:32,648
Laymen's terms, he banged
the back of his head on the way down.

25
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,525
To hit the back of his head on the beam,

26
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,861
he would've needed
to fall backwards, is that right?

27
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,072
- I'd say yes.
- So he might have been pushed.

28
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,908
There's no fingerprints on the railing,
the grates, nothing.

29
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:46,036
No fingerprints? Not from Chase either?

30
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,790
No fingerprints, no tracks.

31
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:54,086
We do have those red fibers
found on the jacket.

32
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,548
I just got the lab report
back from Atlanta.

33
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,385
They did not come
from any of his other clothing.

34
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:05,931
Wool, it says.
That could be a sweater, scarf.

35
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,641
Hell, it could be anything.

36
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,185
And we gotta find it.

37
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:13,272
A beautiful wife, good family. Can't think
of anyone who'd want to kill Chase.

38
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,149
Come on. You know how Chase was.

39
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,902
Tomcattin', ruttin' around
like a penned-up bull let out.

40
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,695
Don't speak ill of the dead, Frank.

41
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,948
I'm just saying
I could think of a few guys up to it.

42
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,909
- Mr. Milton.
- Hi, Sandy.

43
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,119
- The usual? Brunswick stew?
- How'd you guess.

44
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,040
What do you make
of the Chase Andrews case, Tom?

45
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,084
Oh, I'm retired.
That's none of my business anymore.

46
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,795
- Fair enough.
- Could've been that woman in the marsh.

47
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,174
She's crazy enough for the loony bin.
I bet she'd be up to something like this.

48
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,843
My brother's told me
that Marsh Girl's the missing link.

49
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,846
You know poor Chase Andrews had
something going on down in that marsh.

50
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,308
Chase Andrews and the Marsh Girl?
Now if that ain't asking for trouble.

51
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,021
What do you think
really happened, Frank?

52
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,940
You think that Marsh Girl killed Chase?

53
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,442
Hell, I don't know.
Truth will come out.

54
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,844
Look at all these feathers and whatnot.

55
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,808
She a scientist or a witch?

56
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,271
Miss Clark?

57
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,110
- Sheriff's Department.
- Sheriff.

58
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:43,987
Look.

59
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,948
Could get a warrant.

60
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,118
Plain view. Probable cause, sheriff.

61
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,581
Bet that door isn't even locked.

62
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,382
There she is.

63
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:50,471
This is the Sheriff's Department.
Shut down your engine.

64
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:01,607
Go straight, go straight. Follow her in!

65
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,190
- You're guilty!
- You killed Chase Andrews!

66
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,609
- You'll pay for this!
- Rot in jail!

67
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,338
Sunday Justice.
Where you gone, kitty?

68
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,007
Please stay.

69
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,634
Here, kitty, kitty.

70
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,861
Miss Clark?

71
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,573
I'm Tom Milton.

72
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:36,118
I'm a lawyer. May I come in?

73
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,750
Thank you, Mr. Frazier.

74
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:48,046
You probably know that you're being held
for the murder of Chase Andrews.

75
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,509
And I have taken the liberty of putting
myself forward to defend you.

76
00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,970
I know you've never been
in trouble before,

77
00:09:55,053 --> 00:10:00,392
so I can explain the courtroom
and the trial and who is who and whatnot.

78
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,316
Uh, do you have family
that you might want to come be with you?

79
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:19,661
Miss Clark, I don't quite know
how to put this, but, uh...

80
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:25,709
Well, I know you
as Catherine Danielle Clark,

81
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:29,588
but here in Barkley Cove
they don't call you by that name.

82
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,298
They call you Marsh Girl.

83
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:35,260
And when you stand trial,

84
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,013
you will be judged by a jury of your peers

85
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,183
from Barkley Cove,
who only know you as such.

86
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:45,395
They are going to judge you
whether they know you or not.

87
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:52,694
But I can't help you unless I know you.

88
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,988
Even just a little bit.

89
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:00,619
Well, all right, then. Um...

90
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:06,083
I'll come back in a while
when you've had time to consider.

91
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:12,589
Oh, and I brought you this
just in the meantime.

92
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,348
Mr. Frazier.

93
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,189
People forget about the creatures
who live in shells.

94
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,027
I had a family once.

95
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,031
They called me Kya.

96
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,831
Kya!

97
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,876
Kya! You'd better not get too far out.

98
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,669
Get it, get it!

99
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:12,232
Now this little piggy went
to market. Now you hold still.

100
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,861
This little piggy stayed home.

101
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,989
This little piggy ate roast beef.

102
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,034
This little piggy had none.

103
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:28,165
And this little piggy went
wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home.

104
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,004
That's my special girl.

105
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,635
Hey, Jodie!

106
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,971
Hey, Tate!

107
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,098
Wanna come fishing?

108
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,770
- I ain't got too much time.
- "Ain't" isn't a real word.

109
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,692
Hey, how many times I told you
not to mess in my goddamn boat?!

110
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,821
Get in the house! Are you stupid?!

111
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,327
Come here! Now you've done it.

112
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,705
You gotta learn respect. You hear me?

113
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,001
- Stop it! You're hurting her!
- Hey, you leave my pa alone!

114
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,337
Come back on my land,
I'll shoot you! You hear me?!

115
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,547
- Calm down now.
- Shut up!

116
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,216
Shut up!

117
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,681
- Leave me alone!
- I'll show you!

118
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,140
Please just stop!

119
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,597
Ma!

120
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,850
Ma?

121
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,112
<i>Ma never came back.</i>

122
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,992
<i>And everybody else was quick
to get out the same way.</i>

123
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,745
<i>Murph was the first to leave.</i>

124
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,499
<i>A few months later, Mandy and Missy.</i>

125
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,505
<i>Then, finally, Jodie.</i>

126
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,256
Kya.

127
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:44,885
Kya, listen.

128
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,264
I have to go, Kya.
I can't live here no longer.

129
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,561
Kya, you be careful, hear?

130
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:55,854
If you're in trouble,

131
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:59,357
run and hide deep in the marsh
way out where the crawdads sing.

132
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,569
Like Ma always says.

133
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,714
Run!

134
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,342
Jodie!

135
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,805
<i>I learned from the mistakes
of the others how to live with him.</i>

136
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,227
<i>Just keep out of the way.</i>

137
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,686
<i>Don't let him see you.</i>

138
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,939
<i>Fend for yourself.</i>

139
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:35,620
<i>I had been out in the marsh plenty
of times with Jodie, but never alone.</i>

140
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,790
<i>I didn't know which way was home.</i>

141
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,127
Damn you for leaving me here, Jodie!

142
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,547
Damn you.

143
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,350
You okay?

144
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,730
You're Jodie Clark's sister.

145
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,524
Used to be. He's gone.

146
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,946
- You know your way home?
- Yeah.

147
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,040
It's okay. I get lost all the time.

148
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,135
My name's Tate, in case you see me again.

149
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,678
<i>Tate.</i>

150
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,934
<i>There was something about that boy
that eased the tightness in my chest.</i>

151
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:42,520
<i>For the first time
since Ma and Jodie left,</i>

152
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:44,606
<i>I felt something other than hurt.</i>

153
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,693
<i>I felt brave.</i>

154
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,072
I'm hungry.

155
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,922
Morning, Mr. Clark. How you doing?

156
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:13,051
Well, Jumpin',
I woke up on the right side of dirt.

157
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,390
Oh, this is my daughter, Miss Kya Clark.

158
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,809
Well, I'm mighty proud
to know you, Miss Kya.

159
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,021
Oh, don't mind her.
I tell her, uh, stay away from everybody.

160
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,692
- It's a dangerous world, isn't it?
- It is. But the fishing's good.

161
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,860
Could I get a bag of grits?

162
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,405
And some of that Jim Beam?

163
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,449
- And maybe you fill her up for me?
- It's okay.

164
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,244
- Mabel.
- Mm-hm.

165
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,791
You wait for our change, you hear?

166
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,130
Helping out your pa
while your ma's gone, huh?

167
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,966
I ain't seen her in a while.

168
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,928
<i>She's doing chores at home.
Mm-him.</i>

169
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,559
Grits ain't much to go on.

170
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,147
All right. Let's see here.

171
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,733
Your pa left $2 here.

172
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:15,030
And the bill is $1.50.

173
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,282
How much does that leave for gas?

174
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,081
Don't worry about that.

175
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,042
I got another question for you.

176
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,918
You go to school, honey?

177
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,591
Do you know that they publish
the school lunch menu in the paper?

178
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:36,843
Today's is...

179
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,888
Salisbury steak.

180
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:43,641
You could get a nice, hot meal,
make some friends.

181
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,603
Plenty of kids go to school without shoes.

182
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,106
But you will need a skirt.

183
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,274
Ask your mama for one.

184
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,610
There you go.

185
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,572
And the change is 50 cents.

186
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:43,827
Boys!

187
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,079
Chase Andrews,
what you got to say for yourself?

188
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,705
Sorry, Miss Pansy.

189
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,958
We didn't see you
'cause that girl got in the way.

190
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,544
Hello there.

191
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:58,216
I think you've got yourself
turned around the wrong way, little lady.

192
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,968
Isn't school that way?

193
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,886
- So dirty.
- Gross.

194
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,306
You have just as much of a right
to be there.

195
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,809
Go along now. It's all right.

196
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:18,236
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark,
are you reading and writing already?

197
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,323
Can you spell "dog," honey?

198
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,079
Who is that?

199
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:32,333
G-O-D.

200
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,380
Well, we can all use practice, can't we?

201
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:41,259
You can go ahead and sit down,
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

202
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,388
Where you been, marsh hen?

203
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,515
Where's your hat, swamp rat?

204
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,936
Now, boys and girls, settle down.
Just an hour until lunch.

205
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,439
Please, try to pay attention
to our lesson.

206
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,650
Who can tell me a word
that has a long vowel sound?

207
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,945
- She probably lives in the mud.
- Someone's got cooties.

208
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,740
That stink in the room.

209
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,742
Excuse me.

210
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,288
<i>That was the only day
I ever spent in school.</i>

211
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,875
<i>Reckoned I was better off learning
from the wild.</i>

212
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,505
Hi, Tate!

213
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:21,340
Mm-mm.

214
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,065
Need you to be careful out here.
You hear me?

215
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,609
You can't trust nobody.

216
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,778
You protect yourself.

217
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,754
Great horned owl, probably.

218
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,676
<i>For a while, Pa was good to me.</i>

219
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:17,981
Ahem. I thought you could use this
for your feathers, bird nests.

220
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,566
Other stuff you collect.

221
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,404
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

222
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,871
- It was my old Army...
- Mail!

223
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,874
It's my old Army knapsack.

224
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,427
It's from Ma! It's from Ma!

225
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,138
It's Ma's handwriting!

226
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,473
- Ma's alive!
- Give it to me.

227
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,309
Give it to me.

228
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,442
- When's she coming home?
- Wait.

229
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,235
What does she say?

230
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,241
- No!
- Quiet.

231
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,244
Pa! Pa, stop!

232
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,997
Stop it! Stop that!

233
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,749
- Stop!
- Quiet. Quiet!

234
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,292
Ma.

235
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:22,545
Now you listen to me.

236
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,964
She ain't never coming back.

237
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,090
You hear me?

238
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,892
That isn't true.

239
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,481
"Ain't" isn't even a real word!

240
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,035
Goddamn bitch!

241
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,830
Useless.

242
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,043
<i>Pa took to burning any trace of Ma.</i>

243
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,046
Get your shit out of my house.

244
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:11,135
<i>And then one day...</i>

245
00:25:12,470 --> 00:25:13,554
<i>he was gone.</i>

246
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,059
<i>Wasn't like the pain when Ma left.</i>

247
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:22,855
<i>But being completely alone
was a feeling so vast, it echoed.</i>

248
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,920
<i>And there was the small matter
of surviving.</i>

249
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,719
<i>I didn't know
how to do life without grits.</i>

250
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,874
Well, hello, Miss Kya.

251
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,046
You want something?

252
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,465
Mr. Jumpin'...

253
00:26:31,841 --> 00:26:33,968
I hear tell y'all buy mussels.

254
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,304
I got some here.

255
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,058
- They fresh?
- Dug them before dawn.

256
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,142
Just now.

257
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,812
Your pa sent you out with these?

258
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:53,905
Look, I tell you what,
I'll give you 50 cent for the one bag

259
00:26:53,988 --> 00:26:55,907
and a full tank of gas for the other.

260
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,617
How many bags y'all need a week?

261
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,911
Are we striking up a business deal?

262
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:06,000
I buy about 40 pound
every two, three days.

263
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,127
Mind you, others bring them too.

264
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:11,380
So if you bring them,
and I already got some,

265
00:27:11,464 --> 00:27:13,090
why, you'd just be out.

266
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:16,594
It's first come, first served.
Ain't no other way of doing it.

267
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,096
That's fine. Thank you.

268
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,558
Can I, uh...?

269
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,977
Oh, yeah.

270
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,450
You sure are growing up fast, huh?

271
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,120
Why don't you come by next week,
I'll measure your feet.

272
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,749
I got some shoes in the church
donation bin just collecting dust.

273
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,293
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Sure.

274
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,181
Poor child.

275
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:07,353
Her ma's gone,
and now her pa's gone too, I bet.

276
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,438
What?

277
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,859
We ought to be careful,
messing in folk business.

278
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,777
It don't say that in the Bible.

279
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:16,070
"Be careful."

280
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:20,283
"And the King shall answer
and say unto them,

281
00:28:20,366 --> 00:28:24,537
verily I say unto thee,
inasmuch as ye hath done it

282
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,583
unto the least of these,
my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

283
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,792
All right, Mabel.

284
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,295
Don't say about "be careful."

285
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,310
Let's see.

286
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,065
One, two, three. That's all.

287
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,082
<i>They're from Miss Mabel.</i>

288
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:28,142
Catherine Danielle Clark,
of Barkley County, North Carolina,

289
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,770
is charged with the murder
in the first degree

290
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,397
of Chase Lawrence Andrews,

291
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,858
formerly of Barkley Cove.

292
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:39,612
In such cases, the State is allowed
to seek the death penalty.

293
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:41,572
The prosecution has announced
it will do so

294
00:29:41,656 --> 00:29:44,450
if the defendant is found guilty.

295
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,036
Guilty! We all know she's guilty.

296
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,206
She's guilty.

297
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,333
We will now begin jury selection.

298
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,585
Will our prospective jurors
in the first two rows...

299
00:29:54,669 --> 00:29:59,131
There is an option.
It's what's called a plea bargain.

300
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:03,552
And it means
that if you are willing to say

301
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:08,599
that you did go to the tower that night
and met Chase Andrews there

302
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,980
and you had a disagreement,
and in a horrible accident

303
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:16,148
he stepped backwards through the grate,

304
00:30:16,232 --> 00:30:20,111
you'd get ten years,
but you'd be out in six.

305
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,237
No.

306
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,115
If we lose, we lose big.

307
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:27,034
It's life in prison, or the other.

308
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:30,663
Mr. Milton, I won't say anything
that implies guilt.

309
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,874
I will not go to prison.

310
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,209
Please call me Tom.

311
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,586
And promise me
that you will think about this.

312
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,796
I have to get out of here.

313
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:41,465
One way...

314
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:43,426
or the other.

315
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,971
Between midnight and 2 a.m.
on October 30th...

316
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:54,186
the defendant lured Chase Andrews
to the tower and pushed him to his death.

317
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,564
She then covered up her tracks
and fingerprints.

318
00:30:56,647 --> 00:30:59,900
Now, you're gonna hear she had the time,
she had the motivation,

319
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,652
but most importantly...

320
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:08,242
she has the weakness of character
to murder Chase Andrews.

321
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:19,253
Ladies and gentlemen, the State is going
to throw a lot of words at you

322
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,381
about Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

323
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:26,844
But I am asking you
to look at the evidence

324
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,473
that the State will be offering
to back up those words.

325
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,768
You'll find that there is none.

326
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,937
Furthermore, you are going to hear
that there's a good chance

327
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:42,568
no one murdered Chase Andrews
and that the defendant, Miss Clark,

328
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:47,907
finds herself here because it is easier
to lay blame on an outsider

329
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,285
than it is to rely on facts.

330
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:57,374
And although she was born and grew up
not five miles from this courtroom,

331
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,211
Miss Clark is an outsider.

332
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,617
Oh.

333
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,372
Hi.

334
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,959
It's me. Tate.

335
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:27,816
Tundra swan.

336
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:32,738
- How do you know birds?
- My ma liked birds.

337
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,952
I can't read your note.

338
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:47,086
Oh, all I said was I'd seen you
a couple times when I was out fishing,

339
00:34:47,169 --> 00:34:51,090
and it got me thinking that maybe
you could use some seeds and a spark plug.

340
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,718
I had extra.
Thought it might save you a trip to town.

341
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:59,139
And, uh, I don't know,
I figured you'd like the feathers.

342
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,353
All right, then.

343
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,234
All right, then.

344
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,199
Well, I better be going, so...

345
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,417
I could teach you to read.

346
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,215
I thought you may as well learn
to write at the same time.

347
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,925
Oh, yeah.

348
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,678
Good. Okay, so we start with A.

349
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,889
Just go ahead
and draw that shape right there.

350
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,319
Don't tell me.

351
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,321
You're getting there.

352
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:58,407
- Don't help me.
- Sure. I got all day.

353
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:02,661
"There are some who can live

354
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:07,583
without wild things, comma,

355
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:10,961
and some who cannot."

356
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,051
That's what I'm talking about, Kya. Whoo!

357
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,970
And there will never be a time again
where you can't read, ever.

358
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:22,723
I didn't know words could hold so much.

359
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,558
Not all words hold that much.

360
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,231
We could read at my house sometime.

361
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,264
<i>We went through the whole library.</i>

362
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:07,601
<i>Three times a week, summer into fall.</i>

363
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:13,065
<i>Read how plants
and animals change over time</i>

364
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,067
<i>to adjust to the ever-shifting earth.</i>

365
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:22,116
<i>How birds sing mostly at dawn
because the cool, moist air of morning</i>

366
00:37:22,199 --> 00:37:24,785
<i>carries their songs
and their meanings much farther.</i>

367
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:32,626
<i>How some cells divide
and specialize into lungs or hearts</i>

368
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:36,213
<i>while others remain uncommitted
as stem cells</i>

369
00:37:36,296 --> 00:37:37,798
<i>in case they're needed later.</i>

370
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:41,802
<i>Within all the worlds of biology...</i>

371
00:37:43,178 --> 00:37:47,015
<i>I searched for an explanation of why
a mother would leave her offspring.</i>

372
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:54,273
"Mr. Jackson Henry Clark

373
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:59,987
married Miss Julienne Maria Jacques,
June 12, 1933."

374
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:04,366
That means these are my parents.

375
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:08,912
"Master Jeremy Andrew Clark, January 2."

376
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,122
That's Jodie.

377
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:16,462
"Master Napier Murphy Clark,
Miss Mary Helen Clark,

378
00:38:16,545 --> 00:38:18,964
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark."

379
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,140
I miss them.

380
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,269
I had, um...

381
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:36,273
I had forgot how much...

382
00:38:37,858 --> 00:38:39,401
I feel them not here.

383
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,030
But...

384
00:38:45,115 --> 00:38:47,367
I feel them not here right now.

385
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:48,577
I mean...

386
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:53,749
Sometimes I feel so invisible...

387
00:38:55,459 --> 00:38:57,127
I wonder if I'm here at all.

388
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,462
You are.

389
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,602
- Sorry I'm late.
- Come on. Give me a hand.

390
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:17,314
Son, you know I don't listen to idle talk.

391
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:21,235
But there is a regular riptide
of gossip going around

392
00:39:21,318 --> 00:39:23,320
you got something going on
with that Marsh Girl.

393
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,823
Hey, you know you can tell me anything.

394
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:29,618
- She your girlfriend?
- She's my friend.

395
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,871
I bring her books 'cause people are
so nasty to her, she can't go to school.

396
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,290
She doesn't have any family.

397
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:41,213
Hey. Come on. There's no need to be huffy.

398
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:45,175
It's my job to say all the things
that we don't like to talk about,

399
00:39:45,259 --> 00:39:48,762
and I can't give you a lot of things
those other dads can give their sons.

400
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,055
So I'm asking you.

401
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,057
Just be careful.

402
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:56,436
Everything you've worked so hard for,
your dreams of going to Chapel Hill...

403
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,981
Life can change in a second.

404
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,943
You understand that?

405
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,319
Yeah.

406
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:07,948
Now turn up my music, would you? Come on.

407
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:13,287
It's Puccini, in case you're wondering.

408
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:37,811
A young girl living on her own
like that looks immoral, don't you think?

409
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,814
No, sir. I don't. Think, that is.

410
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,525
At least not enough. Just ask my wife.

411
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:49,448
There are some fine group homes
that would help keep a young woman

412
00:40:49,531 --> 00:40:50,532
out of trouble.

413
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,786
They say she comes in here
from time to time.

414
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,414
I do see her from time to time.

415
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,500
She's not alone.
She's got her father with her.

416
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:03,587
Well, I've never seen anybody home
all the times I've been by.

417
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,423
When does she usually come around?

418
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,134
I never know
just when she'll boat in here.

419
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,471
Have her call me next time she comes in.

420
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:19,019
You don't have any reason
to lie to me, do you, boy?

421
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,979
No reason at all, sir.

422
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:40,749
- We gotta meet somewhere else.
- Hi, Kya. Good to see you too.

423
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,626
Social Services are looking for me again.

424
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,920
They're gonna pull me in,
put me in some group home.

425
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,005
It's polite to greet people
when you see them.

426
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,765
You know, a group home
might not be the worst thing.

427
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,519
What? No, no. You'd have
someone cooking you warm meals.

428
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,688
- Real bed.
- I got a real bed.

429
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,983
'Sides, I'd never leave the marsh
to go live with a bunch of strangers.

430
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:09,569
It's "besides," not "'sides."

431
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:12,197
And you can't live alone
in the marsh forever.

432
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,281
Watch me.

433
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:15,659
All right.

434
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,801
Tate.

435
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,345
I, um...

436
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:40,934
I appreciate you teaching me to read

437
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,770
and all the things you gave me.

438
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,106
But why do you do it?

439
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,443
Don't you have a girlfriend or something?

440
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,778
Sometimes I do.

441
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:53,612
Sometimes?

442
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,284
I mean, I've had one.

443
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,370
Uh, but not now...

444
00:43:01,621 --> 00:43:03,457
I don't, so...

445
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,880
Uh, all right.

446
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:10,964
I, uh...

447
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:15,135
I saw you on your pa's boat the other day.

448
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,597
He seems real nice, your dad.

449
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,515
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

450
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,393
You never talk about your ma.

451
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:26,730
What's she like?

452
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:35,405
Uh, you don't have to say nothing.

453
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:40,702
My mother and little sister died
in a car wreck over in Asheville.

454
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,416
My little sister's name was Carianne.

455
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,796
It was, uh...

456
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,469
What, Tate?

457
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,597
You can say anything to me.

458
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:09,689
I think they went to Asheville
to buy me my birthday present.

459
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:14,027
There was this bike I wanted,

460
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,738
and Western Auto didn't carry it...

461
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,868
so I think they went into Asheville
to get that bike for me.

462
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,912
Oh.

463
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,165
And I don't even remember
what kind of bike it was.

464
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:32,963
It wasn't your fault.

465
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,599
Oh!

466
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:49,896
Oh, my gosh!

467
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:14,754
Am I your girlfriend now?

468
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,006
Do you wanna be?

469
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,341
I know feathers.

470
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,345
Bet the other girls don't know feathers.

471
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,390
All right, then.

472
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:27,767
All right, then.

473
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,218
- I've never been out this way.
- It's worth the trip.

474
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,760
You'll see.

475
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:47,097
Happy birthday, Kya.

476
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:51,977
How'd you know it was my birthday?

477
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,645
Oh, I read it in your Bible.

478
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,066
Did you know it was your birthday?

479
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,694
Don't have a calendar.

480
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,408
Oh, um, not my name.

481
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,575
Don't cut my name.

482
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:08,785
Yes, ma'am.

483
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,507
- Mm!
- Pretty good, huh?

484
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:26,219
What's that?

485
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:28,680
Here they come.

486
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:39,566
Oh, wow.

487
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:42,318
Snow geese.

488
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:16,061
Kya.

489
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,104
Kya, look at me.

490
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,071
Kya.

491
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:11,324
Kya, I'm sorry.

492
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,034
I'm sorry.

493
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,703
Jeez.

494
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:20,500
No, Tate, I want to.

495
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:22,918
Why not?

496
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,295
Because I...

497
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,967
I care about you too much.

498
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:35,765
Look, Kya. I want you more than anything,
but I can't be damaged as easily.

499
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:38,434
It's more dangerous for you.
You understand?

500
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:53,658
<i>Fall gave way to winter.</i>

501
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:55,869
<i>Winter to spring.</i>

502
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:00,248
<i>The only constant in nature is change.</i>

503
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,499
Dad, I got in!

504
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:25,356
Why are you quiet?

505
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,110
You know I'm going away soon.

506
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:31,029
To college.

507
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:34,616
You talked about it.

508
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:37,743
When?

509
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,288
Not right away.

510
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,125
Soon.

511
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,253
I got a job at the biology lab.

512
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:49,714
Starts next week, so...

513
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:02,644
Stay here.

514
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,771
And do what?

515
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,735
No, look. I just mean
there's no work for me here.

516
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,613
What am I gonna do?
I don't want to be a shrimper like my dad.

517
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,282
I'm going to get a degree
and be something, Kya.

518
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:18,701
- So could you.
- What do you want me to be?

519
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:22,705
- That's not what I meant.
- You're never gonna come back.

520
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:25,833
Yes, I will. I won't leave you, Kya.
I promise.

521
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,252
I'm gonna come back to you.

522
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:30,964
Kya! Kya, stop! Ky...

523
00:51:32,131 --> 00:51:34,550
You can't run away from every whip stitch!

524
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,907
- One more night.
- One more night.

525
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,100
What's this?

526
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:28,604
It's a list of publishers.

527
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,149
For all your drawings and notes.

528
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,443
There's nothing like them out there, Kya.

529
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,653
There's enough for a book.

530
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:37,113
Lots of books.

531
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,992
And, you know,
you wouldn't have to leave home.

532
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,162
You could just mail your samples
into a publisher.

533
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,414
You know, bring some money in.

534
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:50,168
You know, probably not a huge amount...

535
00:52:51,169 --> 00:52:54,380
but maybe you wouldn't have
to dig mussels the rest of your life.

536
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,258
Just give it a try, Kya.

537
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:00,803
Come on. What can it hurt?

538
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,392
You're gonna forget about me.

539
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:10,938
When you get busy
with all that college stuff,

540
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:12,815
all those pretty girls.

541
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,692
I could never forget you, Kya.

542
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,568
Ever.

543
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:22,784
I'll be home in a month. I promise.
For the Fourth of July. Okay?

544
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,120
I'll be back before you know it.

545
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,499
We'll meet on your beach
and watch fireworks together.

546
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,168
Just write those publishers, all right?

547
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:54,732
Goodbye, Kya.

548
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:56,943
Goodbye, Tate.

549
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,473
<i>Seabirds of the Eastern Seaboard.</i>

550
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,184
Starring you, Big Red.

551
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:32,723
No.

552
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,229
No.

553
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:41,148
No, Tate.

554
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:46,028
No, no.

555
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,572
No.

556
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:50,865
No.

557
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:54,536
No.

558
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:58,082
No, no, no.

559
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:15,891
<i>Tate and life
and love had been the same thing.</i>

560
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:18,436
<i>They were all gone.</i>

561
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,065
<i>And then...</i>

562
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:49,634
<i>Whenever I stumbled, the marsh caught me.</i>

563
00:57:57,183 --> 00:57:58,851
<i>At some unclaimed moment,</i>

564
00:57:58,934 --> 00:58:01,395
<i>at last, the heart pain seeped away,</i>

565
00:58:01,479 --> 00:58:03,439
<i>like water into sand.</i>

566
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:05,274
<i>Still there, but deep.</i>

567
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:11,155
<i>There were no footprints
around the body or on the fire tower.</i>

568
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,032
And no fresh fingerprints either.

569
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,993
Not even on the grate,
which somebody had to open.

570
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:18,537
All this indicated
that someone had destroyed evidence.

571
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:19,747
No more questions.

572
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,583
Your witness.

573
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:33,052
Sheriff,
I'm handing you the tide table

574
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:37,890
for the night of October 29
and the morning of October 30.

575
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:43,270
Now, this shows here
that low tide was around midnight.

576
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:47,775
So at the time
Chase Andrews arrived at the tower

577
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:51,779
and walked to the steps,
he would have made tracks in the wet mud.

578
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:57,118
And then as the groundwater rose,
those tracks would have been wiped out.

579
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:00,037
- Do you agree that this is possible?
- Well...

580
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:03,666
And then you'd agree
that if he had any friends with him,

581
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:06,711
their footprints would be
washed away as well.

582
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:09,088
Under these circumstances,

583
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:15,177
the absence of footprints in
and of itself does not suggest a crime.

584
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:16,846
Correct?

585
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:20,932
Sheriff?

586
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:28,315
The absence of footprints does not,
by itself, prove there was a crime.

587
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:31,444
You also testified
that there were no fingerprints

588
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:35,698
found anywhere in the fire tower,
including on the open grate.

589
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:41,662
So this led you to conclude
that someone must have opened the grate

590
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:44,165
and wiped away
their fingerprints afterwards.

591
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,249
Correct.

592
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:50,963
Now, in fact, isn't it true
that these grates were left open

593
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,758
so often and considered so dangerous

594
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:56,469
that your office submitted
a written request

595
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:58,179
to the U.S. Forest Service

596
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:03,517
to remedy the situation
on July 18 of last year?

597
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:08,856
This is a copy of that request.

598
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:12,234
Who wrote this, sheriff?

599
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:14,862
I did it myself.

600
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:18,657
Would you read to the court
the last sentence of this document

601
01:00:18,741 --> 01:00:20,910
that you sent to the Forest Service?

602
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,078
Just the last sentence.

603
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:26,582
"I must repeat,
these grates are very dangerous,

604
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,375
and if action is not taken...

605
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:35,216
If action is not taken,
a serious injury or death will occur."

606
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:39,053
Thank you, sheriff.

607
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,769
Somebody's been taking pictures
round my house.

608
01:01:28,853 --> 01:01:30,521
What do you think they want?

609
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,273
Developers.

610
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:36,277
They've been all up and down
the marsh last few weeks,

611
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:39,196
wanting to drain the "murky swamp."
Build hotels.

612
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,656
Yeah, I saw them last year.

613
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:44,201
Cutting oak and digging channels
down the way.

614
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:45,953
They want my house?

615
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:47,496
Maybe not the house,

616
01:01:47,580 --> 01:01:49,740
but I bet they offer you
a heap of money for that land.

617
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:50,791
Jumpin'!

618
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,294
There ain't nothing wrong
with some money going to Kya.

619
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:59,133
You do own that land, don't you?
You own that house?

620
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,470
Pa said so.

621
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:05,472
Well, you're gonna need some proof.

622
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,725
A deed, title.

623
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:13,439
Hey.

624
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:16,191
Sorry to startle you.
Can I carry that for ya?

625
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:19,945
- I got it.
- Please. Let me get it.

626
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:22,990
Oh, I'm Chase Andrews.

627
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:25,826
Your name's Kya, right?

628
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:31,373
Yeah. Yeah. It's a nice name.
I like it. It's different but nice.

629
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,336
This is yours right here.

630
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:38,464
There we go.

631
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,094
You wanna go for a picnic
in my boat this Sunday?

632
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:51,310
Okay.

633
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,979
I'll pick you up at noon
from Point Beach. Does that work?

634
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,191
All right. Well, I'll see ya, Kya.

635
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:09,995
<i>Well, here we are.</i>

636
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,291
Mr. Napier Clark, looks like,
bought it in 1897.

637
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,169
Yeah, uh, that's my grandpa.

638
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,088
Yes, ma'am.

639
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:24,802
It's never been sold, so, yes sirree,
I reckon it belongs to you.

640
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:29,098
Looks like you gotta pay some back taxes
if you wanna keep it, Miss Clark.

641
01:03:29,682 --> 01:03:32,017
In fact, ma'am, the way the law reads, uh,

642
01:03:32,101 --> 01:03:35,729
whoever comes along and pays
those back taxes owns the land,

643
01:03:35,813 --> 01:03:37,523
even if they don't got no deed.

644
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:39,608
Well, how much?

645
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:41,485
Looks like about...

646
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:47,741
Eight hundred dollars total.

647
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:06,760
<i>Five years.</i>

648
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:11,306
<i>It had been five years
since Tate showed me this path.</i>

649
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:13,684
<i>Dear Sir or Madam,</i>

650
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:19,648
<i>I am sending you the following pages
on the shells of the Carolina marsh</i>

651
01:04:20,107 --> 01:04:21,608
<i>for your consideration.</i>

652
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:27,364
<i>Five years for my heart
to open its shell again.</i>

653
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:41,336
How's it feel to bask
in the presence of musical genius?

654
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,636
Hey, look.

655
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:55,350
Oh. Oh! That's an ornate scallop.

656
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,478
<i>Pecten ornatus.</i>

657
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,729
All right.

658
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:03,233
- Well, it's unusual to find one here.
- Really?

659
01:05:04,026 --> 01:05:07,321
Yeah. This particular species usually
inhabits regions south of here

660
01:05:07,404 --> 01:05:10,032
'cause these waters are too cool for them.

661
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,409
What?

662
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:18,248
Oh, no, it's just, the Marsh Girl knows
the Latin name for shells

663
01:05:18,874 --> 01:05:21,502
and where they inhabit and why,
for Christ sakes.

664
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:24,129
Here. You keep it.

665
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,133
Thank you.

666
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,765
You're something else, ain't ya?

667
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,834
I know you think I'm trash,
but I'm worth more than a picnic.

668
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,210
Oh, no, Kya. Come on.

669
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,255
I'm sorry. No. Hey, come on.
I've never thought you were trash.

670
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:08,507
Please. I'm sorry.

671
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,510
I understand if you wanna go,
but you can't walk from here.

672
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:12,593
It's too far.

673
01:06:13,262 --> 01:06:14,680
Can I make it up to you?

674
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:19,268
Please, can I make it up to you?

675
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:24,148
I can't believe
you never been up the fire tower.

676
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:27,484
Come here when my family's
all in my business. You know?

677
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:31,530
It's a great way to see
the whole marsh from above.

678
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:37,994
Here.

679
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:04,479
What is it?

680
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:08,525
You can tell me. I won't laugh at you.

681
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:14,698
It's like having a friend your whole life,
but you never saw their full face.

682
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:18,243
Now I see it.

683
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,335
Your house is over there, ain't it?

684
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:31,632
Take me there.

685
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:33,383
Oh, um...

686
01:07:34,551 --> 01:07:36,929
- It's far.
- Hey, I like far.

687
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:41,433
I don't care what it's like,
if that's what you're worried about.

688
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:49,483
Is this it right here?

689
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,696
How long you lived out here by yourself?

690
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,490
Uh, about ten years, I think.

691
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,532
Neat.

692
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:01,745
Living out here with no parents
telling you what to do?

693
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,750
There's really nothing to see inside.

694
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:11,922
- Wow, what you got on the porch?
- What?

695
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:14,341
Oh, um, nothing.

696
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,645
What is all this?

697
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:28,855
Nothing.

698
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:37,948
What, you writing a book or something?

699
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:40,367
Sort of.

700
01:08:41,493 --> 01:08:44,037
These look straight out
of an encyclopedia.

701
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,792
You're the real deal, ain't ya?

702
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:53,463
Ah, swanee.

703
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:55,882
You got a water pump.

704
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,219
I wasn't ready for guests.

705
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:00,512
Hey, don't worry.

706
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:07,060
Hey, there's nobody I know
who could live out here alone like this.

707
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:10,230
I mean, most guys would be too scared.

708
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:14,776
What do you want with me?

709
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:23,243
Okay. Look, I'm real sorry
I came on like that.

710
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,996
I wanna get to know you better. All right?

711
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,581
I think you're gorgeous.

712
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:33,045
I do. I think you're free as a dang gale
and smart as a whip.

713
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:37,257
But I won't do anything
unless you want me to.

714
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:39,592
How's that?

715
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:43,930
That's fine.

716
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:46,725
All right.

717
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:00,781
<i>I didn't know
exactly how I felt about Chase.</i>

718
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,283
<i>But I was no longer lonely.</i>

719
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,452
<i>That seemed enough.</i>

720
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,081
Is that for your book?

721
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,041
Yeah.

722
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,294
Anyway, who knows if anyone will read it.

723
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:16,087
I will.

724
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:18,882
The marsh was our secret.

725
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:30,811
<i>Tell me about your friends.</i>

726
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:32,938
Oh, I don't really have any friends.

727
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:38,235
You always seem to be having
a good time when you're with them.

728
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,319
You spying on me?

729
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:46,034
It's funny. My dad told me once,

730
01:10:46,118 --> 01:10:49,913
he'd had something to drink
and a fight with my mom.

731
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:54,960
He told me if my friends really knew me,
they wouldn't be my friends.

732
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:02,342
I don't know if anyone really knows me,
is what I'm saying, I guess.

733
01:11:06,847 --> 01:11:08,682
I wonder what makes the sky blue.

734
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:12,978
Blue and violet wavelengths from sunlight.

735
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:19,151
They, uh, bounce off the gas particles
in the atmosphere and scatter.

736
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:27,826
Is it okay if I...

737
01:11:29,369 --> 01:11:30,370
kiss you now?

738
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:44,843
<i>Let's turn
to the red wool fibers found</i>

739
01:11:44,926 --> 01:11:46,720
<i>on Chase Andrews' denim jacket</i>

740
01:11:46,803 --> 01:11:48,054
the night he died.

741
01:11:49,014 --> 01:11:52,225
Did you compare those samples
to this red ski cap?

742
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:53,310
Exhibit C.

743
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:57,439
Yes. The fibers from the cap
and the jacket matched exactly.

744
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,274
And where was that cap found?

745
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,902
It was found
in Miss Clark's residence.

746
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:07,199
<i>Now, about these red fibers,
is there any way, doctor,</i>

747
01:12:07,282 --> 01:12:10,160
<i>to determine how long
the fibers had been on the jacket?</i>

748
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:13,872
<i>No. We can tell
where they came from, not when.</i>

749
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:16,082
<i>And if someone wore this hat often,</i>

750
01:12:16,166 --> 01:12:19,753
<i>is it possible the fibers would be
in their hair and on their clothes?</i>

751
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:23,131
<i>Yes. I would suppose they could.</i>

752
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:26,843
So would you agree
that at any time during the years

753
01:12:26,927 --> 01:12:29,554
that the defendant, Miss Clark,
knew Chase Andrews,

754
01:12:29,638 --> 01:12:33,266
the fibers of the hat could have been
transferred onto Chase's jacket?

755
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,894
From what I've seen, yes.

756
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:39,314
- At any time they met.
- Yes.

757
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,000
"Dear Miss Clark,
we were fascinated by your manuscript.

758
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:02,879
If, as you say,
your materials are already complete,

759
01:13:03,505 --> 01:13:06,550
we hope to edit
and publish in record time."

760
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,850
Hey. You're looking
at the new manager of Western Auto.

761
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:19,145
Oh, Chase, that's...

762
01:13:20,105 --> 01:13:22,232
- That's great news.
- Come on. Let's celebrate.

763
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:38,164
So they're gonna, uh,
pay you for those drawings?

764
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:39,249
Yeah.

765
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,710
Ooh!

766
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:47,340
Just don't get too full of yourself,
I guess.

767
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:49,551
I wouldn't.

768
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,849
I know people have disappointed you.

769
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:58,810
And I'm sorry for that.

770
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:02,355
Getting left by your own family. I mean...

771
01:14:03,648 --> 01:14:07,193
God, my family's a pain in the ass,
but I don't think I could take that.

772
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,196
But I want you to know
that I'm gonna take care of you.

773
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:13,325
Now I've been promoted,

774
01:14:13,408 --> 01:14:15,452
I can get you a nice house
when we're married.

775
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,037
- "Married"?
- Yeah.

776
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:20,915
A nice two-story on the beach
with a wraparound veranda.

777
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,251
Yeah.

778
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:28,298
What about your parents?

779
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,841
Have you told them about me?

780
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:32,302
What you gotta understand about my folks

781
01:14:32,385 --> 01:14:35,347
is that if I say you're my choice,
that'd be that.

782
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:38,224
They'll fall in love with you
when they get to know ya.

783
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:43,855
Come here.

784
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,783
Oh, by the way, I have to drive over
to Asheville in a few days

785
01:14:54,866 --> 01:14:56,868
to buy goods for my dad's store.

786
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,787
I was thinking you could come.

787
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:01,414
- Celebrate your book and all.
- Oh...

788
01:15:02,874 --> 01:15:04,834
- There'd be lots of people.
- It doesn't matter.

789
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:06,711
You'd be with me. I know everything.

790
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:10,256
Hell, you don't have to talk to one soul
if you don't want to.

791
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:14,469
Come on. If we're gonna get married,
you need to get out in the world a bit.

792
01:15:15,637 --> 01:15:17,639
Spread those long wings of yours.

793
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:21,601
Come on. It'll be fun.

794
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:33,446
It's a two-day job,
so we'll stay the night.

796
01:15:42,622 --> 01:15:43,915

Hey. It's an adventure. Come on.

799
01:17:29,229 --> 01:17:33,733
It'll feel better for you later,
the more you do it.

800
01:17:35,360 --> 01:17:36,360
Oh.

801
01:17:42,450 --> 01:17:44,160
Hey, I never wanna lose you.

802
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,958
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

803
01:17:51,292 --> 01:17:52,669
I think about it a lot.

804
01:17:54,295 --> 01:17:56,589
Sneaking out at night to come see you.

805
01:17:58,550 --> 01:17:59,551

810
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,407
You have me, and I love you.

811
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:27,495
I made you something.

812
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,173
Oh.

813
01:18:42,427 --> 01:18:44,220
<i>It was a single shell,</i>

814
01:18:44,304 --> 01:18:47,932

tied in a tight knot, and it was missing.</i>

815
01:18:48,016 --> 01:18:52,353
<i>So to be clear, what you're
saying is that the shell necklace</i>

816
01:18:52,437 --> 01:18:56,274
that Chase wore every day
was missing from these items

817
01:18:56,357 --> 01:19:00,486
that law enforcement recovered
from his body the day that he was found.

818
01:19:00,987 --> 01:19:02,238
Is that correct?

819
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:04,699
- I think it's important.
- Yes.

820
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,703
He had that necklace on
when he had dinner with us that night.

821
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:12,790
And it was gone from his body.

822
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,210
And what I'm saying is
he never took it off.

823
01:19:16,711 --> 01:19:18,755
Whoever killed him took it.

824
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:21,966
Objection, Your Honor. It's speculation.

825
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:23,176
Sustained.

826
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:25,178
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

827
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:29,057
you will disregard
that last remark by Mrs. Andrews.

828
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:33,603
Mrs. Andrews,
where did Chase get this necklace?

829
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:37,398
It's from that Marsh Girl.
Miss Clark.

830
01:19:38,066 --> 01:19:40,944
I didn't even know her name
or if she even had one.

831
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:43,905
I can't see why Chase...

832
01:19:45,073 --> 01:19:46,449
But what I'm saying is,

833
01:19:47,033 --> 01:19:51,204
she's the only one who'd have
any interest in taking the thing.

834
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:52,830
Mrs. Andrews...

835
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:58,002
were Chase and Miss Clark
romantically involved?

836
01:19:58,086 --> 01:20:01,047
You could say.
I saw him sneaking out at night.

837
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,968
When I finally asked him
where he was going, he told me the truth.

838
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:08,888
I thought: What would people say?

839
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:13,893
I was a silly woman
to be worried about that next to...

840
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:23,194
But he told me he broke it off with her.

841
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:27,740
She knew she couldn't have him anymore,
so she killed him

842
01:20:27,824 --> 01:20:30,284
- and took back her ugly necklace!
- Objection, Your Honor.

843
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:34,706
Sustained.

844
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:36,541
No further questions,
Your Honor.

845
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:44,298
Um, Mrs. Andrews, you have
my deepest sympathy for your loss.

846
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:47,010
With all due respect,

847
01:20:47,093 --> 01:20:51,806
you are aware that Miss Clark's house
was thoroughly searched.

848
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:56,394
And that the police did not find
the necklace there.

849
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:58,896
- Did they?
- No.

850
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:22,170
Hey.

851
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:24,464
- I got it.
- Hey.

852
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,967
- Almost got you.
- Almost knocked me out.

853
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:30,011
Just trying to show off.

854
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,348
What's that Marsh Girl like
in bed, man? Is she an animal?

855
01:21:34,432 --> 01:21:37,143
Wild as a bobcat and worth
every bit of the gas money.

856
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:39,020
Tell me her eyes glow.

857
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:42,265
- Only for me and only when I make them.
- Hey, don't talk about her like that.

858
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:46,736
- What's that?
- I said don't talk about her like that.

859
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:48,613
Oh, the college boy.

860
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,326
- He taught the Marsh Girl her ABCs.
- Oh.

861
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,203
- Mmm.
- You're a waste of her time.

862
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:59,373
Go ahead, college boy. What you gonna do?

863
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:02,710
- Come on, you're tough, right?
- Come on, let's do something.

864
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:06,089
- You wanna hit me?
- Hey, y'all settle down now.

865
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:07,173
That's enough.

866
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,427
Settle down before someone get hurt.

867
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:13,721
There's better ways than this.

868
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:35,118
Hey, Kya.

869
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:39,079
Hey, what the hell?

870
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:41,999
Wait! Kya, wait! Please.

871
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:43,167
Look, I just wanna talk.

872
01:22:43,251 --> 01:22:45,128
Get out of my lagoon, you dirty creep!

873
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:47,046
Kya, please! I just need to talk to you!

874
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,756
I don't care what you want!

875
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:52,051
I never wanna see you again. Ever.

876
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:54,053
Kya, I need to talk to you
about Chase, okay?

877
01:22:54,137 --> 01:22:56,889
- About Chase?
- He's not good enough for you.

878
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:01,352
You're the one who left me.

879
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:06,941
Who didn't come back when you promised.
Who never came back.

880
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:13,698
You didn't even write to explain
or even to say if you were alive or dead.

881
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:14,991
You just disappeared.

882
01:23:15,074 --> 01:23:18,411
I know. And I'm so sorry, Kya,
you have no idea.

883
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:21,914
You weren't man enough to face me.

884
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,292
You're right, Kya.

885
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:27,211
Everything you say is true.

886
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:30,548
Leaving you like that was
the worst thing I've ever done,

887
01:23:30,631 --> 01:23:32,341
the worst thing I'll ever do in my life.

888
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:37,305
I knew how badly I'd hurt you,
and I couldn't face you, like you said.

889
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:44,645
I thought you wouldn't be able to leave
the marsh and live in any other world.

890
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:49,525
You know, I thought I had to choose
between you and everything else.

891
01:23:49,609 --> 01:23:52,278
But the truth is, Kya,
everything else that I thought mattered,

892
01:23:52,361 --> 01:23:55,531
the scholarships, the grants, the jobs,
it means nothing without you.

893
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,368
I was so wrong.

894
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:01,996
I've been sorry for years.

895
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:06,834
And I'll be sorry for the rest of my life.

896
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:18,803
You look...

897
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:32,443
I brought you something.

898
01:24:50,253 --> 01:24:53,422
You know, I'm working
at the new lab near town.

899
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:56,342
You'd love it, Kya.

900
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,594
I get to study all this
under a microscope.

901
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:03,057
So I'm here now.

902
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:06,602
I'm back for good.

903
01:25:16,654 --> 01:25:18,698
Kya, I would do anything to...

904
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,078
I would've done
so many things differently.

905
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:34,672
What do you want now, Tate?

906
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:37,508
Is there any way
that you could possibly forgive me, Kya?

907
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:40,927
Please?

908
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:45,308
I don't know how.

909
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:12,668
Kya, I trust you would tell me
if you knew of anyone else

910
01:26:12,752 --> 01:26:15,338
who had reason to harm Chase Andrews.

911
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:21,761
Well, all right, then.

912
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,929
Try and get some rest.

913
01:26:30,478 --> 01:26:32,188
Oh. Hi.

914
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:34,398
Hey. What you doing in town?

915
01:26:34,482 --> 01:26:38,402

so I thought we could celebrate.

- There he is.

917
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:49,914
Kya, you know Brian, Tina, Pearl.

918
01:26:50,748 --> 01:26:53,334
- You guys know Kya.
- Sure, yeah, the Marsh Girl.

919
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:55,753

about Murph, Mandy or Missy.

950
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:52,239
I wouldn't know them
if I passed them in the street.

951
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:53,866
And, um...

952
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:56,952
what about Ma?

953
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,915
Ma passed, Kya.

954
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:12,593
Ma had a sister, Rosemary.

955
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:15,554
She found me in the Army
and told me what happened.

956
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:18,849
Showed up at Rosemary's door
in her alligator shoes.

957
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:21,560
Rosemary said she didn't talk for months.

958
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:24,521
And then about a year later,
she remembered she had children.

959
01:31:24,605 --> 01:31:28,150
Rosemary helped her write a letter to Pa,
asking if she could come get us.

960
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:32,237
And he told her
if she ever so much as contacted us again,

961
01:31:32,321 --> 01:31:34,031
he'd beat us unrecognizable.

962
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:37,117
Yeah, sounds like Pa.

963
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:39,620
She saved up for lawyers and everything,

964
01:31:40,371 --> 01:31:41,872
but then she got sick.

965
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:42,956
Leukemia.

966
01:31:43,874 --> 01:31:44,875
She tried, but...

967
01:31:44,958 --> 01:31:46,377
She never had a chance.

968
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:50,381
I've been waiting...

969
01:31:51,924 --> 01:31:54,093
all these years
for her to walk down the lane.

970
01:31:55,928 --> 01:31:58,347
You didn't have a family your whole life,

971
01:31:59,181 --> 01:32:01,642
and there's nothing I can do
to give you that back.

972
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:06,397
But I'd like to come see you
as much as I can get up here.

973
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:12,945
Yeah, I'd like that.

974
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:51,942
<i>Mabel's gonna be so proud.</i>

975
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:53,402
Just one more thing.

976
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:57,823
I'll be sure he gets it.

977
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:00,325
Thank you, Jumpin'.

978
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:06,582
<i>How y'all doing?</i>

979
01:33:06,665 --> 01:33:09,501
One pack of your finest, please, sir.

980
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:11,086
And give me some matches.

981
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:13,172
- Sure thing.
- "Sure thing."

982
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,383
Kya Clark.

983
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:18,761
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

984
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:20,721
You wrote a damn book. Come here.

985
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,723
Wait, wait, wait. I wanna talk to you.

986
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:24,725
Don't act like that. Come on.

987
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:26,769
Leave me alone.

988
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:32,441
Damn, the Marsh Girl thinks
she's too good for you now.

989
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:34,067
Shut up!

990
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:36,403
Here you go, sir. It's on the house.

991
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:47,456
Thought I might find you here.

992
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:50,209
I told you to leave me alone.

993
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:53,712
No, I know, but I just...
Listen, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

994
01:33:53,796 --> 01:33:57,216
Really. I feel bad about
how things turned out.

995
01:33:58,425 --> 01:33:59,885
"How things turned out"?

996
01:34:01,345 --> 01:34:02,971
What, you mean how it turned out

997
01:34:03,055 --> 01:34:05,390
you were engaged
the whole time we were together?

998
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:10,020
How it turned out
that you lie to everybody?

999
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:12,606
Kya, I have to do things
I don't wanna do. You know that.

1000
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:15,776
No, I have to get married
to someone like Pearl. I had to.

1001
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,653
But you're the one I really want.

1002
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:24,243
You know any other man
would have tried to change you?

1003
01:34:25,035 --> 01:34:26,161
To fix you?

1004
01:34:27,496 --> 01:34:28,747
I never did.

1005
01:34:30,249 --> 01:34:33,001
No, no. Please, please, wait.
I need you. I really need you.

1006
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:36,505
Don't leave me all alone in that place.

1007
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:38,674
You know, nobody else knows me.

1008
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,055
You know, I feel sorry for you.

1009
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:49,393
But I want nothing to do with any of that.

1010
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:04,783
Wilder than ever.

1011
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:10,455
I know you want this too.

1012
01:35:10,539 --> 01:35:12,416
- Stop!
- I know you want this too.

1013
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:21,341
You're mine, Kya. You belong to me.
I'm not letting you go this time.

1014
01:35:42,154 --> 01:35:44,323
Leave me alone, you bastard!

1015
01:35:45,699 --> 01:35:48,702
You bother me again and I'll kill you!

1016
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:51,622
<i>She shouted it real loud, sir.</i>

1017
01:35:51,705 --> 01:35:53,749
<i>I heard a commotion, and I come closer,</i>

1018
01:35:53,832 --> 01:35:56,960
<i>see if anybody was in trouble,
and there she was.</i>

1019
01:35:57,044 --> 01:35:59,004
And do you recognize the woman?

1020
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:03,300
Is she in the courtroom today?

1021
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:05,677
Yes, that one there. The defendant.

1022
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:08,263
The one folks call Marsh Girl.

1023
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:16,480
<i>I finally understood why
Ma had to leave.</i>

1024
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,007
<i>One thing I learned from Pa,</i>

1025
01:37:25,674 --> 01:37:27,926
<i>these men have to have the last punch.</i>

1026
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:57,622
<i>Being isolated was one thing.</i>

1027
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,668
<i>Living in fear, quite another.</i>

1028
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:05,589
<i>I will never live like that.</i>

1029
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:10,677
<i>A life wondering
when the next fist will fall.</i>

1030
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:33,950
Tate, you can't be here.

1031
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:36,036
I just wanted to check on you.

1032
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:38,622
- Jumpin' said he hadn't seen you since...
- Not now.

1033
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:41,875
Kya, what happened to your face?

1034
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:45,170
Was it Chase?
Tell me, Kya. Did he do this?

1035
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:46,880
I need you to stay out of it.

1036
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:48,298
That son of a bitch.

1037
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:51,843
- That son of a bitch.
- Tate, I need you to go.

1038
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:53,178
Kya.

1039
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:01,853
You know, I was gonna go
to Greenville next week.

1040
01:39:05,107 --> 01:39:06,733
Finally meet my publishers.

1041
01:39:08,944 --> 01:39:10,529
Talk about the next book.

1042
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:12,489
I was feeling brave enough.

1043
01:39:12,989 --> 01:39:14,616
Well, you can still go.

1044
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:16,284
Looking like this?

1045
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:18,120
Don't let him ruin this for you.

1046
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:20,413
Go to Greenville.

1047
01:39:21,331 --> 01:39:22,916
Okay? There's a bus.

1048
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:24,793
It's easy. Jumpin's got the schedule.

1049
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,504
Let them put you up in a nice hotel,

1050
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:30,382
eat some hot restaurant food
you didn't have to make.

1051
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,342
Stay a week, if you can.

1052
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:36,221
And I'll come see you
when you're back. Okay?

1053
01:39:37,264 --> 01:39:39,057
Hear how it all went with the publishers.

1054
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,017
All right.

1055
01:39:48,525 --> 01:39:49,526
Hey, you cold?

1056
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:54,281
I'm fine. I don't need you
to take care of me.

1057
01:39:54,364 --> 01:39:56,241
I know, but just take my hat.

1058
01:39:56,867 --> 01:39:58,994
- I said I don't need your help.
- Just take it.

1059
01:40:27,856 --> 01:40:30,400
<i>You wanna tell me
what happened to your eye?</i>

1060
01:40:31,735 --> 01:40:33,820
I need to write down the bus schedule.

1061
01:40:33,904 --> 01:40:35,405
You have a copy, right?

1062
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:43,663
It was that Chase, wasn't it?

1063
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,626
Kya, look at me.

1064
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:52,547
Now you tell me what he did.

1065
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:56,092
I can't say it.

1066
01:40:57,719 --> 01:40:58,803
It's over now.

1067
01:40:59,596 --> 01:41:01,389
I just want it out of my life.

1068
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:03,725
And how you know
he ain't coming after you again?

1069
01:41:05,018 --> 01:41:07,729
- You're all by your lonesome out there.
- Jumpin', please.

1070
01:41:09,022 --> 01:41:10,815
You can't tell anybody.

1071
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:12,651
You know how it is.

1072
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:17,948
They'd drag me into the sheriff's office
and make me describe it to a bunch of men.

1073
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:22,619
And then write me up in the papers,
accusing me of whoring.

1074
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,789
Or trying to get money out of his parents.

1075
01:41:26,665 --> 01:41:28,333
Okay? They'd do nothing about it.

1076
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:29,459
You're right, Kya.

1077
01:41:32,045 --> 01:41:34,506
And I ain't gonna do anything
to make this thing worse.

1078
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:40,011
But you let me know
when you're coming and going.

1079
01:41:40,095 --> 01:41:41,137
You hear?

1080
01:41:41,972 --> 01:41:43,848
I gotta know if you're out of town.

1081
01:41:47,269 --> 01:41:50,438
'Cause if I don't see you for a while...

1082
01:41:55,819 --> 01:41:57,153
Thank you, Jumpin'.

1083
01:41:58,238 --> 01:41:59,906
I'm leaving in a few days.

1084
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:03,243
I'll come see you as soon as I'm back.

1085
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:06,663
Okay, that's good.

1086
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:08,623
That's good.

1087
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:16,840
<i>Miss Price, would you tell us
what you saw on the morning of October 29?</i>

1088
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:18,883
I saw the Marsh Girl...

1089
01:42:18,967 --> 01:42:20,635
Miss Clark, that is. Pardon me.

1090
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,763
- ...get on the 9:00 bus.
- You've got quite a good memory.

1091
01:42:23,847 --> 01:42:24,889
We all talked about it.

1092
01:42:24,973 --> 01:42:27,434
<i>We'd never seen her
all cleaned up like that.</i>

1093
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:28,852
<i>Hair combed, makeup.</i>

1094
01:42:29,686 --> 01:42:34,024
<i>Just to be clear,
on the morning of October 29,</i>

1095
01:42:34,107 --> 01:42:38,903
<i>you and several others saw
Miss Clark board the 9 a.m. bus</i>

1096
01:42:38,987 --> 01:42:40,822
<i>and leave Barkley Cove.</i>

1097
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,866
- Yes, that's right.
- Thank you, Miss Price.

1098
01:42:42,949 --> 01:42:44,576
No further questions, Your Honor.

1099
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:49,164
Miss Price, is the Piggly Wiggly open
at 1:30 in the morning?

1100
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:50,957
No, sir.

1101
01:42:52,042 --> 01:42:53,668
Well, the reason I ask is,

1102
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:57,422
you couldn't have seen who got off
the night bus from Greenville,

1103
01:42:57,964 --> 01:43:00,675
nor could you have seen
who got on the 2:30 a.m. bus

1104
01:43:00,759 --> 01:43:04,304
from Barkley Cove
back to Greenville, could you?

1105
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,056
Well, no. Of course not.

1106
01:43:06,139 --> 01:43:10,977
So after you saw Miss Clark board
that morning bus to Greenville...

1107
01:43:12,729 --> 01:43:15,523
she could have returned
to Barkley Cove that night

1108
01:43:15,607 --> 01:43:19,527
and been back in Greenville for breakfast,
all without you taking notice.

1109
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,821
<i>My name is Robert Foster.</i>

1110
01:43:21,905 --> 01:43:25,116
I'm a senior editor
at Harrison Morris Publishing Company

1111
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,284
in Boston, Massachusetts.

1112
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:30,663
Mr. Foster, you sat down
for dinner with Miss Clark at 7 p.m.

1113
01:43:30,747 --> 01:43:32,791
on the night of October 29.

1114
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:34,125
- Correct?
- Yes.

1115
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:36,252
What was your first impression of her?

1116
01:43:37,754 --> 01:43:43,385
My first impression was, uh, that she was
very shy, very gentle, very smart.

1117
01:43:44,344 --> 01:43:46,137
I knew that she was something
of a recluse,

1118
01:43:46,221 --> 01:43:49,099
but I also knew
that she was a gifted naturalist.

1119
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:52,143
<i>- How long did that dinner go on?
- At least a few hours.</i>

1120
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:53,937
Some female insects do eat
their mates.

1121
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,815
Fireflies, in fact,
have two different light signals.

1122
01:43:57,315 --> 01:43:58,441
One for mating,

1123
01:43:58,525 --> 01:44:01,528
and one to attract a male
in order to make him her next meal.

1124
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:03,363
- So she eats him?
- How gruesome.

1125
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:06,116
- Oh, dear.
- I must spend less time with insects.

1126
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:08,535
- It's quite amoral.
- Amoral, indeed.

1127
01:44:08,618 --> 01:44:10,954
I don't know
if there is a dark side to nature.

1128
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:14,499
Just inventive ways to endure.

1129
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:16,876
Against all odds.

1130
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:21,548
And when you met with Miss Clark
the following morning, October 30th,

1131
01:44:21,631 --> 01:44:25,593
was there anything unusual
about her appearance or her demeanor?

1132
01:44:25,677 --> 01:44:26,845
Not at all.

1133
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,139
No further questions, Your Honor.

1134
01:44:29,222 --> 01:44:31,724
Mr. Foster, did Miss Clark stay

1135
01:44:31,808 --> 01:44:34,394
at the same hotel
as you and your colleagues?

1136
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:37,105
No. She preferred a smaller hotel.

1137
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:39,732
The, uh, Mountain something.

1138
01:44:39,816 --> 01:44:43,069
Could you look at this map
of Greenville for me, please?

1139
01:44:43,153 --> 01:44:47,740
I think you'll see The Piedmont,
where you and your colleagues stayed,

1140
01:44:47,824 --> 01:44:51,828
and then The Three Mountains Hotel,
where Miss Clark stayed.

1141
01:44:51,911 --> 01:44:55,415
Could you tell me
which one is closest to the bus station?

1142
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:59,502
The Three Mountains Hotel is closer.

1143
01:44:59,586 --> 01:45:03,214
In fact, The Three Mountains is
the closest hotel

1144
01:45:03,298 --> 01:45:05,508
to the Greenville bus station.
Is that correct?

1145
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:07,927
Looks that way.

1146
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:10,430
No further questions.

1147
01:45:10,513 --> 01:45:14,017
I don't think a good lawyer ever puts
their client on the stand,

1148
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,685
but this might help you.

1149
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:20,690
For the jury to be able
to hear from you, directly.

1150
01:45:21,941 --> 01:45:25,028
For them to be able to see you...

1151
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:28,990
as the kind
and thoughtful person you truly are.

1152
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:30,700
They're never gonna see me like that.

1153
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:34,204
Listen. I know you have a world
of reasons to hate these people...

1154
01:45:34,287 --> 01:45:35,705
No, I never hated them.

1155
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:37,290
They hated me.

1156
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:41,794
They laughed at me. They left me.

1157
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:44,756
They harassed me. They attacked me.

1158
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:47,717
You... You want me to beg for my life?

1159
01:45:48,885 --> 01:45:50,094
I don't have it in me.

1160
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,721
I won't.

1161
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:56,142
I will not offer myself up.

1162
01:45:56,226 --> 01:45:57,685
They can make their decision.

1163
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:03,900
But they're not deciding
anything about me.

1164
01:46:05,902 --> 01:46:06,903
It's them.

1165
01:46:08,821 --> 01:46:10,281
They're judging themselves.

1166
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:14,160
All right, then.

1167
01:46:21,543 --> 01:46:24,712
Mr. Milton,
you have always been kind to me.

1168
01:46:26,214 --> 01:46:27,465
Even as a child.

1169
01:46:29,259 --> 01:46:30,468
I never forgot.

1170
01:46:40,645 --> 01:46:44,357
<i>His life was cut short
by the jilted lover</i>

1171
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:47,652
<i>who could not accept
that he had returned to the fold.</i>

1172
01:46:48,194 --> 01:46:52,657
<i>A witness saw Miss Clark
and Chase in the marsh.</i>

1173
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,493
<i>Heard her say the words "I'll kill you."</i>

1174
01:46:56,077 --> 01:46:57,412
<i>And what's more,</i>

1175
01:46:57,495 --> 01:47:01,791
<i>is there's physical evidence
from that night connecting them.</i>

1176
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:05,461
<i>Fibers from her red wool cap</i>

1177
01:47:05,962 --> 01:47:07,839
<i>left on his denim jacket.</i>

1178
01:47:07,922 --> 01:47:09,465
Dad, I'm going over to deal with it.

1179
01:47:09,549 --> 01:47:12,510
<i>Who else would have motive
to take that shell necklace?</i>

1180
01:47:14,512 --> 01:47:17,015
You can, and you must,

1181
01:47:17,098 --> 01:47:21,686
find that the defendant is guilty
of first-degree murder.

1182
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:32,614
Mr. Milton.

1183
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:52,592
I have lived in Barkley Cove
my whole life.

1184
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,764
And like you, I heard the tall tales

1185
01:47:57,847 --> 01:47:59,766
told about the Marsh Girl.

1186
01:48:00,308 --> 01:48:02,602
That she was part wolf.

1187
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:06,356
A missing link between ape and man.

1188
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:09,317
That her eyes glowed in the dark.

1189
01:48:11,069 --> 01:48:13,780
Well, here she is.

1190
01:48:14,656 --> 01:48:18,576
The reality is that she was
an abandoned child.

1191
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:23,164
A little girl surviving out there
in the marsh on her own,

1192
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:25,875
reviled and shunned.

1193
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:32,256
Mr. James Madison and his wife, Mabel,

1194
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,592
they are sitting here
in the courtroom today.

1195
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:38,596
They're about the only people
in this town who showed her any care.

1196
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:40,056
The rest of us...

1197
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:44,394
Well, I'm ashamed to say

1198
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:51,150
that we labeled her and rejected her
because we thought she was different.

1199
01:48:51,859 --> 01:48:53,152
And now...

1200
01:48:55,071 --> 01:48:58,825
the job of judging this shy
and rejected young woman

1201
01:48:58,908 --> 01:49:01,494
has fallen on your shoulders.

1202
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:06,999
But you must base your judgment
on the facts presented in this courtroom,

1203
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:13,172
and not on the rumors and feelings
from the past 25 years.

1204
01:49:13,256 --> 01:49:16,175
Miss Clark has a solid alibi.

1205
01:49:16,259 --> 01:49:19,595
She was in Greenville
the night Chase Andrews died.

1206
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:24,517
And what facts, exactly,
stand against her?

1207
01:49:26,352 --> 01:49:31,315
The State has not proven
that this incident was indeed a murder,

1208
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:34,485
and not just some tragic accident.

1209
01:49:35,528 --> 01:49:39,198
The State wants you to believe
that at 11:30 at night,

1210
01:49:39,282 --> 01:49:41,826
without a single witness seeing her,

1211
01:49:41,909 --> 01:49:45,288
she caught the last bus
from Greenville to Barkley Cove,

1212
01:49:45,371 --> 01:49:47,999
and rode that bus disguised,

1213
01:49:48,082 --> 01:49:51,419
since neither of the bus drivers
that night could identify her

1214
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:54,630
as a passenger,
all the way back to Barkley Cove.

1215
01:49:54,714 --> 01:49:58,468
And then, in less than an hour...

1216
01:50:00,178 --> 01:50:03,014
she tracks down Chase Andrews
in the middle of the night,

1217
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:05,600
lures him to the tower, murders him,

1218
01:50:05,683 --> 01:50:07,769
wipes away all physical evidence,

1219
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:12,732
and somehow catches
the 2:30 a.m. bus back to Greenville.

1220
01:50:12,815 --> 01:50:15,318
Again,
without a single witness seeing her.

1221
01:50:15,401 --> 01:50:18,321
And after doing all that,

1222
01:50:19,572 --> 01:50:23,034
she meets with her publishers
the next morning, unruffled.

1223
01:50:23,117 --> 01:50:25,036
Now, these are not facts.

1224
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:28,790
These are just more of the rumors

1225
01:50:28,873 --> 01:50:34,253
and tall tales that we have been spreading
about Miss Clark her entire life.

1226
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:39,050
I believe you will come
to a judgment based on the facts,

1227
01:50:39,133 --> 01:50:42,512
and not the gossip
that you have heard for years.

1228
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:45,848
It's time, at last,

1229
01:50:46,933 --> 01:50:51,020
for all of us to be fair
to the Marsh Girl.

1230
01:50:53,231 --> 01:50:55,483
Maybe you should go home
and do your waiting there.

1231
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:58,152
Six hours already.
How long do you think they'll take?

1232
01:50:58,236 --> 01:51:00,613
Well, let's hope
they take a good long while.

1233
01:51:00,696 --> 01:51:04,575
If a few jurors have doubts,
we got a chance.

1234
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:22,677
Mr. Foreman, is it correct
that the jury has reached a verdict?

1235
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:24,387
We have, Your Honor.

1236
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:42,530
The defendant will please rise
for the reading of the verdict.

1237
01:51:47,618 --> 01:51:48,619
Stand up.

1238
01:51:58,588 --> 01:52:02,925
"We, the jury, find the defendant,
Catherine Danielle Clark...

1239
01:52:04,218 --> 01:52:09,599
not guilty of first-degree murder
of Mr. Chase Andrews."

1240
01:52:15,897 --> 01:52:18,274
Miss Clark, you are free to go.

1241
01:52:18,357 --> 01:52:22,278
And I apologize, on behalf of the State,
for the time that you have served.

1242
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:24,113
This court is dismissed.

1243
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:29,368
Thank you.

1244
01:52:35,499 --> 01:52:36,500
Come here.

1245
01:52:39,045 --> 01:52:41,672
You're okay. You're all right.

1246
01:52:43,382 --> 01:52:46,719
You just forget about this nonsense.
We're looking forward to the next book.

1247
01:53:02,026 --> 01:53:03,361
Can you take me home?

1248
01:53:51,742 --> 01:53:53,703
<i>Now I can finally admit.</i>

1249
01:53:54,829 --> 01:53:59,208
<i>All the months in isolation,
yearning to be back in the marsh,</i>

1250
01:53:59,875 --> 01:54:02,712
<i>it was knowing
how much was left to explore,</i>

1251
01:54:03,671 --> 01:54:06,132
<i>how much life to uncover in the wild,</i>

1252
01:54:06,215 --> 01:54:07,383
<i>that kept me going.</i>

1253
01:54:09,635 --> 01:54:10,886
<i>And the hope,</i>

1254
01:54:11,721 --> 01:54:13,097
<i>always that hope...</i>

1255
01:54:14,682 --> 01:54:16,642
<i>that one day I could share it...</i>

1256
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:21,856
<i>with the only person
I had ever truly loved.</i>

1257
01:54:52,511 --> 01:54:53,596
Kya!

1258
01:54:55,139 --> 01:54:56,139
Kya.

1259
01:55:11,947 --> 01:55:12,947
Hey.

1260
01:55:13,657 --> 01:55:15,034
You know I love you, right?

1261
01:56:19,723 --> 01:56:20,723
What?

1262
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:24,270
Will you, uh...? Sorry. I'm sorry.

1263
01:56:27,064 --> 01:56:28,232
Will you marry me?

1264
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:31,152
I mean, do you want to?

1265
01:56:34,864 --> 01:56:36,282
Well, aren't we already?

1266
01:56:38,033 --> 01:56:39,034
Like geese?

1267
01:56:42,163 --> 01:56:43,831
I can live with that, I guess.

1268
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:47,501
Come here.

1269
01:56:59,638 --> 01:57:01,640
Oh, here we go.

1270
01:57:01,724 --> 01:57:02,641
Hey.

1271
01:57:02,725 --> 01:57:04,768
Hey, you. Hi, there.

1272
01:57:10,816 --> 01:57:12,443
Come here, baby girl.

1273
01:57:14,445 --> 01:57:16,488
He loved you so much.

1274
01:57:26,957 --> 01:57:28,876
Kya. Look at that.

1275
01:57:28,959 --> 01:57:31,545
You see that up there?
On the elbow of that branch?

1276
01:57:33,589 --> 01:57:35,799
When's the last time we saw one of those?

1277
01:57:36,884 --> 01:57:37,885
I know.

1278
01:57:42,348 --> 01:57:45,392
This book's pretty good.
This guy's still talking about...

1279
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:01,450
<i>I hope when it is time
for me to leave,</i>

1280
01:58:01,533 --> 01:58:04,703
<i>I will go quick and easy,
without making too much noise.</i>

1281
01:58:25,641 --> 01:58:26,642
Ma!

1282
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:28,352
Ma.

1283
01:58:33,482 --> 01:58:34,482
Ma.

1284
01:58:36,277 --> 01:58:37,277
<i>Kya?</i>

1285
01:58:37,945 --> 01:58:38,946
Kya!

1286
01:59:17,026 --> 01:59:18,736
<i>It has always been enough...</i>

1287
01:59:19,820 --> 01:59:22,448
<i>to be part of the natural sequence
of things.</i>

1288
01:59:23,866 --> 01:59:25,159
<i>Sure as the tides.</i>

1289
01:59:25,993 --> 01:59:27,369
<i>Nature my guide.</i>

1290
01:59:31,999 --> 01:59:34,043
<i>The marsh knows all about death...</i>

1291
01:59:37,046 --> 01:59:39,673
<i>and doesn't necessarily
define it as tragedy.</i>

1292
01:59:40,841 --> 01:59:42,259
<i>Certainly not a sin.</i>

1293
01:59:44,011 --> 01:59:48,057
<i>It understands that every creature
does what it must to survive.</i>

1294
01:59:50,726 --> 01:59:53,896
<i>And that sometimes, for prey to live...</i>

1295
01:59:55,105 --> 01:59:56,857
<i>its predator must die.</i>

1296
02:00:25,135 --> 02:00:26,470
<i>I am the marsh now.</i>

1297
02:00:28,555 --> 02:00:30,140
<i>I am the feather of an egret.</i>

1298
02:00:31,433 --> 02:00:33,936
<i>I am every shell washed upon the shore.</i>

1299
02:00:37,731 --> 02:00:39,108
<i>I am a firefly.</i>

1300
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:43,612
<i>You'll see hundreds beckoning far
into the dark reaches of the marsh.</i>

1301
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:46,782
<i>And that's where you will always find me.</i>

1302
02:00:47,991 --> 02:00:49,243
<i>Way out yonder.</i>

1303
02:00:49,952 --> 02:00:51,412
