0
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:11,972
Marsh is not swamp.

1
00:01:13,974 --> 00:01:16,060
Marsh is a space of light...

2
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:20,522
where grass grows in water...

3
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:24,193
and water flows into the sky.

4
00:02:08,445 --> 00:02:11,115
Then within the marsh, here and there...

5
00:02:13,492 --> 00:02:14,702
true swamp.

6
00:02:54,950 --> 00:02:56,869
A swamp knows all about death...

7
00:02:58,245 --> 00:03:00,748
and doesn't necessarily
define it as tragedy.

8
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,208
Certainly not a sin.

9
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:08,547
I thought Chase Andrews
would have more common sense.

10
00:03:09,339 --> 00:03:11,467
Best quarterback this town ever had.

11
00:03:15,137 --> 00:03:17,890
Boys, are these your footprints here?

12
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:18,974
Yes, sir.

13
00:03:26,106 --> 00:03:27,524
Where's his footprints?

14
00:03:35,157 --> 00:03:38,368
Yeah, some kids
just get crazy ideas in their heads

15
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:41,205
and drink and think they're invincible.

16
00:03:41,789 --> 00:03:44,166
That Chase Andrews was no Kid.

17
00:03:57,012 --> 00:03:59,264
Hey. Look at this.

18
00:04:08,774 --> 00:04:12,069
- He open the grate himself?
- Could've been an accident, all the same.

19
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:15,906
Time of death,
between midnight and 2 a.m.

20
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,910
Cause of death,
sudden impact from the 63-foot drop.

21
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:24,081
Since you found that blood
and hair on the support beam,

22
00:04:24,665 --> 00:04:28,001
I would deduce that was
the cause of the primary injury.

23
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:33,048
Laymen's terms, he banged
the back of his head on the way down.

24
00:04:33,131 --> 00:04:34,925
To hit the back of his head on the beam,

25
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:37,261
he would've needed
to fall backwards, is that right?

26
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:40,472
- I'd say yes.
- So he might have been pushed.

27
00:04:40,556 --> 00:04:43,308
There's no fingerprints on the railing,
the grates, nothing.

28
00:04:43,392 --> 00:04:46,436
No fingerprints? Not from Chase either?

29
00:04:48,021 --> 00:04:50,190
No fingerprints, no tracks.

30
00:04:50,274 --> 00:04:54,486
We do have those red fibers
found on the jacket.

31
00:04:55,070 --> 00:04:57,948
I just got the lab report
back from Atlanta.

32
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:01,785
They did not come
from any of his other clothing.

33
00:05:01,869 --> 00:05:06,331
Wool, it says.
That could be a sweater, scarf.

34
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:08,041
Hell, it could be anything.

35
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,585
And we gotta find it.

36
00:05:09,668 --> 00:05:13,672
A beautiful wife, good family. Can't think
of anyone who'd want to kill Chase.

37
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:15,549
Come on. You know how Chase was.

38
00:05:15,632 --> 00:05:18,302
Tomcattin', ruttin' around
like a penned-up bull let out.

39
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,095
Don't speak ill of the dead, Frank.

40
00:05:20,178 --> 00:05:23,348
I'm just saying
I could think of a few guys up to it.

41
00:05:23,432 --> 00:05:25,309
- Mr. Milton.
- Hi, Sandy.

42
00:05:25,392 --> 00:05:27,519
- The usual? Brunswick stew?
- How'd you guess.

43
00:05:28,854 --> 00:05:31,440
What do you make
of the Chase Andrews case, Tom?

44
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:34,484
Oh, I'm retired.
That's none of my business anymore.

45
00:05:34,568 --> 00:05:37,195
- Fair enough.
- Could've been that woman in the marsh.

46
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:40,574
She's crazy enough for the loony bin.
I bet she'd be up to something like this.

47
00:05:40,657 --> 00:05:43,243
My brother's told me
that Marsh Girl's the missing link.

48
00:05:43,327 --> 00:05:46,246
You know poor Chase Andrews had
something going on down in that marsh.

49
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,708
Chase Andrews and the Marsh Girl?
Now if that ain't asking for trouble.

50
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:54,421
What do you think
really happened, Frank?

51
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:56,340
You think that Marsh Girl killed Chase?

52
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:58,842
Hell, I don't know.
Truth will come out.

53
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:26,244
Look at all these feathers and whatnot.

54
00:06:28,038 --> 00:06:31,208
She a scientist or a witch?

55
00:06:34,294 --> 00:06:35,671
Miss Clark?

56
00:06:39,508 --> 00:06:41,510
- Sheriff's Department.
- Sheriff.

57
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:44,387
Look.

58
00:06:44,846 --> 00:06:46,348
Could get a warrant.

59
00:06:47,057 --> 00:06:49,518
Plain view. Probable cause, sheriff.

60
00:06:52,062 --> 00:06:53,981
Bet that door isn't even locked.

61
00:07:44,698 --> 00:07:45,782
There she is.

62
00:07:47,451 --> 00:07:50,871
This is the Sheriff's Department.
Shut down your engine.

63
00:07:59,171 --> 00:08:02,007
Go straight, go straight. Follow her in!

64
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:43,590
- You're guilty!
- You killed Chase Andrews!

65
00:08:43,673 --> 00:08:46,009
- You'll pay for this!
- Rot in jail!

66
00:09:03,485 --> 00:09:06,738
Sunday Justice.
Where you gone, kitty?

67
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,407
Please stay.

68
00:09:09,491 --> 00:09:11,034
Here, kitty, kitty.

69
00:09:28,009 --> 00:09:29,261
Miss Clark?

70
00:09:31,096 --> 00:09:32,973
I'm Tom Milton.

71
00:09:33,056 --> 00:09:36,518
I'm a lawyer. May I come in?

72
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:43,150
Thank you, Mr. Frazier.

73
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:48,446
You probably know that you're being held
for the murder of Chase Andrews.

74
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:52,909
And I have taken the liberty of putting
myself forward to defend you.

75
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:55,370
I know you've never been
in trouble before,

76
00:09:55,453 --> 00:10:00,792
so I can explain the courtroom
and the trial and who is who and whatnot.

77
00:10:04,212 --> 00:10:07,716
Uh, do you have family
that you might want to come be with you?

78
00:10:15,348 --> 00:10:20,061
Miss Clark, I don't quite know
how to put this, but, uh...

79
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:26,109
Well, I know you
as Catherine Danielle Clark,

80
00:10:26,193 --> 00:10:29,988
but here in Barkley Cove
they don't call you by that name.

81
00:10:30,071 --> 00:10:31,698
They call you Marsh Girl.

82
00:10:32,824 --> 00:10:35,660
And when you stand trial,

83
00:10:35,744 --> 00:10:38,413
you will be judged by a jury of your peers

84
00:10:38,496 --> 00:10:41,583
from Barkley Cove,
who only know you as such.

85
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:45,795
They are going to judge you
whether they know you or not.

86
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:53,094
But I can't help you unless I know you.

87
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:55,388
Even just a little bit.

88
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:01,019
Well, all right, then. Um...

89
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:06,483
I'll come back in a while
when you've had time to consider.

90
00:11:08,693 --> 00:11:12,989
Oh, and I brought you this
just in the meantime.

91
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,748
Mr. Frazier.

92
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:29,589
People forget about the creatures
who live in shells.

93
00:11:32,968 --> 00:11:34,427
I had a family once.

94
00:11:36,888 --> 00:11:38,431
They called me Kya.

95
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:46,231
Kya!

96
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:49,276
Kya! You'd better not get too far out.

97
00:11:51,069 --> 00:11:52,069
Get it, get it!

98
00:12:09,087 --> 00:12:12,632
Now this little piggy went
to market. Now you hold still.

99
00:12:14,426 --> 00:12:16,261
This little piggy stayed home.

100
00:12:17,053 --> 00:12:19,389
This little piggy ate roast beef.

101
00:12:20,056 --> 00:12:22,434
This little piggy had none.

102
00:12:22,517 --> 00:12:28,565
And this little piggy went
wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home.

103
00:12:32,485 --> 00:12:34,404
That's my special girl.

104
00:12:38,825 --> 00:12:40,035
Hey, Jodie!

105
00:12:41,953 --> 00:12:43,371
Hey, Tate!

106
00:12:43,455 --> 00:12:45,498
Wanna come fishing?

107
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:50,170
- I ain't got too much time.
- "Ain't" isn't a real word.

108
00:12:52,213 --> 00:12:56,092
Hey, how many times I told you
not to mess in my goddamn boat?!

109
00:12:58,053 --> 00:13:00,221
Get in the house! Are you stupid?!

110
00:13:02,974 --> 00:13:05,727
Come here! Now you've done it.

111
00:13:06,895 --> 00:13:09,105
You gotta learn respect. You hear me?

112
00:13:10,648 --> 00:13:13,401
- Stop it! You're hurting her!
- Hey, you leave my pa alone!

113
00:13:13,485 --> 00:13:15,737
Come back on my land,
I'll shoot you! You hear me?!

114
00:13:15,820 --> 00:13:17,947
- Calm down now.
- Shut up!

115
00:13:19,616 --> 00:13:20,616
Shut up!

116
00:13:24,496 --> 00:13:26,081
- Leave me alone!
- I'll show you!

117
00:13:26,164 --> 00:13:27,540
Please just stop!

118
00:14:06,496 --> 00:14:07,997
Ma!

119
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,250
Ma?

120
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:22,512
Ma never came back.

121
00:14:24,764 --> 00:14:27,392
And everybody else was quick
to get out the same way.

122
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:30,145
Murph was the first to leave.

123
00:14:31,938 --> 00:14:34,899
A few months later, Mandy and Missy.

124
00:14:38,111 --> 00:14:40,905
Then, finally, Jodie.

125
00:14:41,656 --> 00:14:42,656
Kya.

126
00:14:44,284 --> 00:14:45,285
Kya, listen.

127
00:14:46,327 --> 00:14:49,664
I have to go, Kya.
I can't live here no longer.

128
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,961
Kya, you be careful, hear?

129
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:56,254
If you're in trouble,

130
00:14:56,337 --> 00:14:59,757
run and hide deep in the marsh
way out where the crawdads sing.

131
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:02,969
Like Ma always says.

132
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:23,114
Run!

133
00:15:24,741 --> 00:15:25,742
Jodie!

134
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:30,205
I learned from the mistakes
of the others how to live with him.

135
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,627
Just keep out of the way.

136
00:15:35,710 --> 00:15:37,086
Don't let him see you.

137
00:15:38,046 --> 00:15:39,339
Fend for yourself.

138
00:16:31,766 --> 00:16:36,020
I had been out in the marsh plenty
of times with Jodie, but never alone.

139
00:16:37,647 --> 00:16:39,190
I didn't know which way was home.

140
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:42,527
Damn you for leaving me here, Jodie!

141
00:16:44,946 --> 00:16:45,947
Damn you.

142
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:57,750
You okay?

143
00:17:00,503 --> 00:17:02,130
You're Jodie Clark's sister.

144
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,924
Used to be. He's gone.

145
00:17:08,177 --> 00:17:10,346
- You know your way home?
- Yeah.

146
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,440
It's okay. I get lost all the time.

147
00:17:30,199 --> 00:17:32,535
My name's Tate, in case you see me again.

148
00:17:33,036 --> 00:17:34,078
Tate.

149
00:17:35,413 --> 00:17:39,334
There was something about that boy
that eased the tightness in my chest.

150
00:17:40,585 --> 00:17:42,920
For the first time
since Ma and Jodie left,

151
00:17:43,004 --> 00:17:45,006
I felt something other than hurt.

152
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,093
I felt brave.

153
00:17:51,471 --> 00:17:52,472
I'm hungry.

154
00:18:06,277 --> 00:18:09,322
Morning, Mr. Clark. How you doing?

155
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:13,451
Well, Jumpin',
I woke up on the right side of dirt.

156
00:18:15,119 --> 00:18:18,790
Oh, this is my daughter, Miss Kya Clark.

157
00:18:18,873 --> 00:18:21,209
Well, I'm mighty proud
to know you, Miss Kya.

158
00:18:22,126 --> 00:18:25,421
Oh, don't mind her.
I tell her, uh, stay away from everybody.

159
00:18:25,505 --> 00:18:29,092
- It's a dangerous world, isn't it?
- It is. But the fishing's good.

160
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:31,260
Could I get a bag of grits?

161
00:18:31,344 --> 00:18:33,805
And some of that Jim Beam?

162
00:18:34,430 --> 00:18:36,849
- And maybe you fill her up for me?
- It's okay.

163
00:18:37,975 --> 00:18:39,644
- Mabel.
- Mm-hm.

164
00:18:43,439 --> 00:18:45,191
You wait for our change, you hear?

165
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,530
Helping out your pa
while your ma's gone, huh?

166
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:53,366
I ain't seen her in a while.

167
00:18:54,492 --> 00:18:57,328
- She's doing chores at home.
- Mm-him.

168
00:19:01,374 --> 00:19:02,959
Grits ain't much to go on.

169
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,547
All right. Let's see here.

170
00:19:07,630 --> 00:19:10,133
Your pa left $2 here.

171
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:15,430
And the bill is $1.50.

172
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:17,682
How much does that leave for gas?

173
00:19:24,272 --> 00:19:25,481
Don't worry about that.

174
00:19:25,565 --> 00:19:27,442
I got another question for you.

175
00:19:28,151 --> 00:19:29,318
You go to school, honey?

176
00:19:32,196 --> 00:19:34,991
Do you know that they publish
the school lunch menu in the paper?

177
00:19:35,742 --> 00:19:37,243
Today's is...

178
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,288
Salisbury steak.

179
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:44,041
You could get a nice, hot meal,
make some friends.

180
00:19:44,751 --> 00:19:47,003
Plenty of kids go to school without shoes.

181
00:19:47,628 --> 00:19:50,506
But you will need a skirt.

182
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:51,674
Ask your mama for one.

183
00:19:53,009 --> 00:19:54,010
There you go.

184
00:19:54,677 --> 00:19:57,972
And the change is 50 cents.

185
00:20:43,226 --> 00:20:44,227
Boys!

186
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:46,479
Chase Andrews,
what you got to say for yourself?

187
00:20:46,562 --> 00:20:48,105
Sorry, Miss Pansy.

188
00:20:48,189 --> 00:20:50,358
We didn't see you
'cause that girl got in the way.

189
00:20:52,944 --> 00:20:53,944
Hello there.

190
00:20:55,196 --> 00:20:58,616
I think you've got yourself
turned around the wrong way, little lady.

191
00:20:58,699 --> 00:21:00,368
Isn't school that way?

192
00:21:00,451 --> 00:21:02,286
- So dirty.
- Gross.

193
00:21:03,371 --> 00:21:05,706
You have just as much of a right
to be there.

194
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:08,209
Go along now. It's all right.

195
00:21:14,215 --> 00:21:18,636
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark,
are you reading and writing already?

196
00:21:21,055 --> 00:21:22,723
Can you spell "dog," honey?

197
00:21:27,186 --> 00:21:28,479
Who is that?

198
00:21:29,063 --> 00:21:32,733
G-O-D.

199
00:21:34,902 --> 00:21:37,780
Well, we can all use practice, can't we?

200
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:41,659
You can go ahead and sit down,
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

201
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:45,788
Where you been, marsh hen?

202
00:21:45,872 --> 00:21:47,915
Where's your hat, swamp rat?

203
00:21:47,999 --> 00:21:52,336
Now, boys and girls, settle down.
Just an hour until lunch.

204
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,839
Please, try to pay attention
to our lesson.

205
00:21:54,922 --> 00:21:58,050
Who can tell me a word
that has a long vowel sound?

206
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:01,345
- She probably lives in the mud.
- Someone's got cooties.

207
00:22:01,429 --> 00:22:04,140
That stink in the room.

208
00:22:05,141 --> 00:22:06,142
Excuse me.

209
00:22:08,561 --> 00:22:10,688
That was the only day
I ever spent in school.

210
00:22:11,939 --> 00:22:14,275
Reckoned I was better off learning
from the wild.

211
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,905
Hi, Tate!

212
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,740
Mm-mm.

213
00:22:35,087 --> 00:22:37,465
Need you to be careful out here.
You hear me?

214
00:22:38,591 --> 00:22:40,009
You can't trust nobody.

215
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:42,178
You protect yourself.

216
00:22:58,486 --> 00:23:00,154
Great horned owl, probably.

217
00:23:02,323 --> 00:23:05,076
For a while, Pa was good to me.

218
00:23:13,042 --> 00:23:18,381
Ahem. I thought you could use this
for your feathers, bird nests.

219
00:23:18,464 --> 00:23:19,966
Other stuff you collect.

220
00:23:23,052 --> 00:23:24,804
- Oh, thank you.
- Yeah.

221
00:23:32,103 --> 00:23:34,271
- It was my old Army...
- Mail!

222
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:37,274
It's my old Army knapsack.

223
00:23:45,491 --> 00:23:47,827
It's from Ma! It's from Ma!

224
00:23:48,536 --> 00:23:50,538
It's Ma's handwriting!

225
00:23:50,621 --> 00:23:52,873
- Ma's alive!
- Give it to me.

226
00:23:53,624 --> 00:23:54,709
Give it to me.

227
00:24:00,881 --> 00:24:02,842
- When's she coming home?
- Wait.

228
00:24:03,551 --> 00:24:04,635
What does she say?

229
00:24:08,973 --> 00:24:10,641
- No!
- Quiet.

230
00:24:11,225 --> 00:24:13,644
Pa! Pa, stop!

231
00:24:13,728 --> 00:24:16,397
Stop it! Stop that!

232
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,149
- Stop!
- Quiet. Quiet!

233
00:24:19,692 --> 00:24:20,692
Ma.

234
00:24:21,944 --> 00:24:22,945
Now you listen to me.

235
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,364
She ain't never coming back.

236
00:24:26,490 --> 00:24:27,490
You hear me?

237
00:24:34,999 --> 00:24:36,292
That isn't true.

238
00:24:39,795 --> 00:24:41,881
"Ain't" isn't even a real word!

239
00:24:52,767 --> 00:24:54,435
Goddamn bitch!

240
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,230
Useless.

241
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:02,443
Pa took to burning any trace of Ma.

242
00:25:03,611 --> 00:25:05,446
Get your shit out of my house.

243
00:25:10,367 --> 00:25:11,535
And then one day...

244
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:13,954
he was gone.

245
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:18,459
Wasn't like the pain when Ma left.

246
00:25:18,542 --> 00:25:23,255
But being completely alone
was a feeling so vast, it echoed.

247
00:25:44,026 --> 00:25:46,320
And there was the small matter
of surviving.

248
00:25:50,491 --> 00:25:53,119
I didn't know
how to do life without grits.

249
00:26:21,647 --> 00:26:23,274
Well, hello, Miss Kya.

250
00:26:27,528 --> 00:26:29,446
You want something?

251
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:30,865
Mr. Jumpin'...

252
00:26:32,241 --> 00:26:34,368
I hear tell y'all buy mussels.

253
00:26:35,244 --> 00:26:36,704
I got some here.

254
00:26:38,831 --> 00:26:41,458
- They fresh?
- Dug them before dawn.

255
00:26:41,542 --> 00:26:42,542
Just now.

256
00:26:43,127 --> 00:26:45,212
Your pa sent you out with these?

257
00:26:50,885 --> 00:26:54,305
Look, I tell you what,
I'll give you 50 cent for the one bag

258
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:56,307
and a full tank of gas for the other.

259
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,017
How many bags y'all need a week?

260
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,311
Are we striking up a business deal?

261
00:27:02,813 --> 00:27:06,400
I buy about 40 pound
every two, three days.

262
00:27:06,984 --> 00:27:08,527
Mind you, others bring them too.

263
00:27:08,611 --> 00:27:11,780
So if you bring them,
and I already got some,

264
00:27:11,864 --> 00:27:13,490
why, you'd just be out.

265
00:27:13,574 --> 00:27:16,994
It's first come, first served.
Ain't no other way of doing it.

266
00:27:17,077 --> 00:27:19,496
That's fine. Thank you.

267
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:22,958
Can I, uh...?

268
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:25,377
Oh, yeah.

269
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,850
You sure are growing up fast, huh?

270
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,520
Why don't you come by next week,
I'll measure your feet.

271
00:27:43,604 --> 00:27:47,149
I got some shoes in the church
donation bin just collecting dust.

272
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:49,693
- Thank you, ma'am.
- Sure.

273
00:28:01,497 --> 00:28:02,581
Poor child.

274
00:28:03,916 --> 00:28:07,753
Her ma's gone,
and now her pa's gone too, I bet.

275
00:28:08,754 --> 00:28:09,838
What?

276
00:28:09,922 --> 00:28:13,259
We ought to be careful,
messing in folk business.

277
00:28:13,342 --> 00:28:15,177
It don't say that in the Bible.

278
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:16,470
"Be careful."

279
00:28:17,471 --> 00:28:20,683
"And the King shall answer
and say unto them,"

280
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:24,937
verily I say unto thee,
inasmuch as ye hath done it

281
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:28,983
"unto the least of these,
my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

282
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:30,192
All right, Mabel.

283
00:28:31,277 --> 00:28:32,695
Don't say about "be careful."

284
00:28:45,791 --> 00:28:47,710
Let's see.

285
00:28:51,714 --> 00:28:53,465
One, two, three. That's all.

286
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:10,482
They're from Miss Mabel.

287
00:29:24,413 --> 00:29:28,542
Catherine Danielle Clark,
of Barkley County, North Carolina,

288
00:29:28,625 --> 00:29:31,170
is charged with the murder
in the first degree

289
00:29:31,253 --> 00:29:33,797
of Chase Lawrence Andrews,

290
00:29:33,881 --> 00:29:36,258
formerly of Barkley Cove.

291
00:29:36,342 --> 00:29:40,012
In such cases, the State is allowed
to seek the death penalty.

292
00:29:40,095 --> 00:29:41,972
The prosecution has announced
it will do so

293
00:29:42,056 --> 00:29:44,850
if the defendant is found guilty.

294
00:29:44,933 --> 00:29:47,436
Guilty! We all know she's guilty.

295
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:50,606
She's guilty.

296
00:29:50,689 --> 00:29:52,733
We will now begin jury selection.

297
00:29:52,816 --> 00:29:54,985
Will our prospective jurors
in the first two rows...

298
00:29:55,069 --> 00:29:59,531
There is an option.
It's what's called a plea bargain.

299
00:30:00,449 --> 00:30:03,952
And it means
that if you are willing to say

300
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:08,999
that you did go to the tower that night
and met Chase Andrews there

301
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:14,380
and you had a disagreement,
and in a horrible accident

302
00:30:14,463 --> 00:30:16,548
he stepped backwards through the grate,

303
00:30:16,632 --> 00:30:20,511
you'd get ten years,
but you'd be out in six.

304
00:30:20,594 --> 00:30:21,637
No.

305
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:24,515
If we lose, we lose big.

306
00:30:24,598 --> 00:30:27,434
It's life in prison, or the other.

307
00:30:27,518 --> 00:30:31,063
Mr. Milton, I won't say anything
that implies guilt.

308
00:30:32,481 --> 00:30:34,274
I will not go to prison.

309
00:30:34,358 --> 00:30:35,609
Please call me Tom.

310
00:30:35,692 --> 00:30:37,986
And promise me
that you will think about this.

311
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,196
I have to get out of here.

312
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:41,865
One way...

313
00:30:42,991 --> 00:30:43,826
or the other.

314
00:30:43,909 --> 00:30:47,371
Between midnight and 2 a.m.
on October 30th...

315
00:30:48,789 --> 00:30:54,586
the defendant lured Chase Andrews
to the tower and pushed him to his death.

316
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:56,964
She then covered up her tracks
and fingerprints.

317
00:30:57,047 --> 00:31:00,300
Now, you're gonna hear she had the time,
she had the motivation,

318
00:31:00,384 --> 00:31:02,052
but most importantly...

319
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:08,642
she has the weakness of character
to murder Chase Andrews.

320
00:31:14,314 --> 00:31:19,653
Ladies and gentlemen, the State is going
to throw a lot of words at you

321
00:31:19,736 --> 00:31:22,781
about Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

322
00:31:24,241 --> 00:31:27,244
But I am asking you
to look at the evidence

323
00:31:27,327 --> 00:31:30,873
that the State will be offering
to back up those words.

324
00:31:31,707 --> 00:31:34,168
You'll find that there is none.

325
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:37,337
Furthermore, you are going to hear
that there's a good chance

326
00:31:37,421 --> 00:31:42,968
no one murdered Chase Andrews
and that the defendant, Miss Clark,

327
00:31:43,051 --> 00:31:48,307
finds herself here because it is easier
to lay blame on an outsider

328
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:51,685
than it is to rely on facts.

329
00:31:51,768 --> 00:31:57,774
And although she was born and grew up
not five miles from this courtroom,

330
00:31:58,734 --> 00:32:00,611
Miss Clark is an outsider.

331
00:33:53,932 --> 00:33:55,017
Oh.

332
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:01,772
Hi.

333
00:34:02,149 --> 00:34:04,359
It's me. Tate.

334
00:34:27,049 --> 00:34:28,216
Tundra swan.

335
00:34:29,718 --> 00:34:33,138
- How do you know birds?
- My ma liked birds.

336
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,352
I can't read your note.

337
00:34:43,273 --> 00:34:47,486
Oh, all I said was I'd seen you
a couple times when I was out fishing,

338
00:34:47,569 --> 00:34:51,490
and it got me thinking that maybe
you could use some seeds and a spark plug.

339
00:34:51,573 --> 00:34:55,118
I had extra.
Thought it might save you a trip to town.

340
00:34:56,036 --> 00:34:59,539
And, uh, I don't know,
I figured you'd like the feathers.

341
00:35:03,502 --> 00:35:04,753
All right, then.

342
00:35:09,466 --> 00:35:10,634
All right, then.

343
00:35:15,639 --> 00:35:17,599
Well, I better be going, so...

344
00:35:25,273 --> 00:35:26,817
I could teach you to read.

345
00:35:31,196 --> 00:35:33,615
I thought you may as well learn
to write at the same time.

346
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,325
Oh, yeah.

347
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:38,078
Good. Okay, so we start with A.

348
00:35:39,287 --> 00:35:41,289
Just go ahead
and draw that shape right there.

349
00:35:52,718 --> 00:35:53,719
Don't tell me.

350
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:55,721
You're getting there.

351
00:35:55,804 --> 00:35:58,807
- Don't help me.
- Sure. I got all day.

352
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:03,061
"There are some who can live"

353
00:36:03,854 --> 00:36:07,983
without wild things, comma,

354
00:36:08,608 --> 00:36:11,361
"and some who cannot."

355
00:36:14,197 --> 00:36:17,451
That's what I'm talking about, Kya. Whoo!

356
00:36:17,534 --> 00:36:20,370
And there will never be a time again
where you can't read, ever.

357
00:36:20,454 --> 00:36:23,123
I didn't know words could hold so much.

358
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:24,958
Not all words hold that much.

359
00:36:29,838 --> 00:36:31,631
We could read at my house sometime.

360
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,664
We went through the whole library.

361
00:37:05,165 --> 00:37:08,001
Three times a week, summer into fall.

362
00:37:11,087 --> 00:37:13,465
Read how plants
and animals change over time

363
00:37:13,548 --> 00:37:15,467
to adjust to the ever-shifting earth.

364
00:37:18,512 --> 00:37:22,516
How birds sing mostly at dawn
because the cool, moist air of morning

365
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:25,185
carries their songs
and their meanings much farther.

366
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:33,026
How some cells divide
and specialize into lungs or hearts

367
00:37:33,902 --> 00:37:36,613
while others remain uncommitted
as stem cells

368
00:37:36,696 --> 00:37:38,198
in case they're needed later.

369
00:37:40,075 --> 00:37:42,202
Within all the worlds of biology...

370
00:37:43,578 --> 00:37:47,415
I searched for an explanation of why
a mother would leave her offspring.

371
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,673
"Mr. Jackson Henry Clark

372
00:37:54,756 --> 00:38:00,387
married Miss Julienne Maria Jacques,
June 12, 1933."

373
00:38:01,638 --> 00:38:04,766
That means these are my parents.

374
00:38:05,684 --> 00:38:09,312
"Master Jeremy Andrew Clark, January 2."

375
00:38:09,396 --> 00:38:10,522
That's Jodie.

376
00:38:11,356 --> 00:38:16,862
"Master Napier Murphy Clark,
Miss Mary Helen Clark,

377
00:38:16,945 --> 00:38:19,364
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark."

378
00:38:27,455 --> 00:38:28,540
I miss them.

379
00:38:31,668 --> 00:38:32,669
I had, um...

380
00:38:35,171 --> 00:38:36,673
I had forgot how much...

381
00:38:38,258 --> 00:38:39,801
I feel them not here.

382
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:44,430
But...

383
00:38:45,515 --> 00:38:47,767
I feel them not here right now.

384
00:38:47,851 --> 00:38:48,977
I mean...

385
00:38:52,063 --> 00:38:54,149
Sometimes I feel so invisible...

386
00:38:55,859 --> 00:38:57,527
I wonder if I'm here at all.

387
00:38:58,862 --> 00:38:59,862
You are.

388
00:39:11,708 --> 00:39:14,002
- Sorry I'm late.
- Come on. Give me a hand.

389
00:39:15,462 --> 00:39:17,714
Son, you know I don't listen to idle talk.

390
00:39:18,924 --> 00:39:21,635
But there is a regular riptide
of gossip going around

391
00:39:21,718 --> 00:39:23,720
you got something going on
with that Marsh Girl.

392
00:39:25,513 --> 00:39:27,223
Hey, you know you can tell me anything.

393
00:39:28,058 --> 00:39:30,018
- She your girlfriend?
- She's my friend.

394
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,271
I bring her books 'cause people are
so nasty to her, she can't go to school.

395
00:39:34,439 --> 00:39:35,690
She doesn't have any family.

396
00:39:37,484 --> 00:39:41,613
Hey. Come on. There's no need to be huffy.

397
00:39:42,656 --> 00:39:45,575
It's my job to say all the things
that we don't like to talk about,

398
00:39:45,659 --> 00:39:49,162
and I can't give you a lot of things
those other dads can give their sons.

399
00:39:49,245 --> 00:39:50,455
So I'm asking you.

400
00:39:51,373 --> 00:39:52,457
Just be careful.

401
00:39:53,458 --> 00:39:56,836
Everything you've worked so hard for,
your dreams of going to Chapel Hill...

402
00:39:57,712 --> 00:39:59,381
Life can change in a second.

403
00:40:01,925 --> 00:40:03,343
You understand that?

404
00:40:03,426 --> 00:40:04,719
Yeah.

405
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:08,348
Now turn up my music, would you? Come on.

406
00:40:11,601 --> 00:40:13,687
It's Puccini, in case you're wondering.

407
00:40:33,707 --> 00:40:38,211
A young girl living on her own
like that looks immoral, don't you think?

408
00:40:38,294 --> 00:40:41,214
No, sir. I don't. Think, that is.

409
00:40:41,297 --> 00:40:43,925
At least not enough. Just ask my wife.

410
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:49,848
There are some fine group homes
that would help keep a young woman

411
00:40:49,931 --> 00:40:50,932
out of trouble.

412
00:40:52,934 --> 00:40:55,186
They say she comes in here
from time to time.

413
00:40:55,270 --> 00:40:57,814
I do see her from time to time.

414
00:40:58,481 --> 00:41:00,900
She's not alone.
She's got her father with her.

415
00:41:00,984 --> 00:41:03,987
Well, I've never seen anybody home
all the times I've been by.

416
00:41:04,904 --> 00:41:06,823
When does she usually come around?

417
00:41:06,906 --> 00:41:09,534
I never know
just when she'll boat in here.

418
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,871
Have her call me next time she comes in.

419
00:41:16,332 --> 00:41:19,419
You don't have any reason
to lie to me, do you, boy?

420
00:41:19,502 --> 00:41:21,379
No reason at all, sir.

421
00:41:38,021 --> 00:41:41,149
- We gotta meet somewhere else.
- Hi, Kya. Good to see you too.

422
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,026
Social Services are looking for me again.

423
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:45,320
They're gonna pull me in,
put me in some group home.

424
00:41:45,403 --> 00:41:47,405
It's polite to greet people
when you see them.

425
00:41:53,828 --> 00:41:57,165
You know, a group home
might not be the worst thing.

426
00:41:57,957 --> 00:42:00,919
What? No, no. You'd have
someone cooking you warm meals.

427
00:42:01,002 --> 00:42:03,088
- Real bed.
- I got a real bed.

428
00:42:03,963 --> 00:42:07,383
'Sides, I'd never leave the marsh
to go live with a bunch of strangers.

429
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:09,969
It's "besides," not "'sides."

430
00:42:10,637 --> 00:42:12,597
And you can't live alone
in the marsh forever.

431
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:13,681
Watch me.

432
00:42:15,058 --> 00:42:16,059
All right.

433
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:33,201
Tate.

434
00:42:34,577 --> 00:42:35,745
I, um...

435
00:42:38,206 --> 00:42:41,334
I appreciate you teaching me to read

436
00:42:41,918 --> 00:42:44,170
and all the things you gave me.

437
00:42:45,213 --> 00:42:46,506
But why do you do it?

438
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,843
Don't you have a girlfriend or something?

439
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:52,178
Sometimes I do.

440
00:42:53,012 --> 00:42:54,012
Sometimes?

441
00:42:55,181 --> 00:42:57,684
I mean, I've had one.

442
00:42:59,394 --> 00:43:00,770
Uh, but not now...

443
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:03,857
I don't, so...

444
00:43:08,653 --> 00:43:10,280
Uh, all right.

445
00:43:10,363 --> 00:43:11,364
I, uh...

446
00:43:12,949 --> 00:43:15,535
I saw you on your pa's boat the other day.

447
00:43:17,745 --> 00:43:18,997
He seems real nice, your dad.

448
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:20,915
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

449
00:43:21,624 --> 00:43:23,793
You never talk about your ma.

450
00:43:26,045 --> 00:43:27,130
What's she like?

451
00:43:33,011 --> 00:43:35,805
Uh, you don't have to say nothing.

452
00:43:37,056 --> 00:43:41,102
My mother and little sister died
in a car wreck over in Asheville.

453
00:43:44,606 --> 00:43:46,816
My little sister's name was Carianne.

454
00:43:49,944 --> 00:43:51,196
It was, uh...

455
00:43:56,701 --> 00:43:57,869
What, Tate?

456
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:00,997
You can say anything to me.

457
00:44:07,003 --> 00:44:10,089
I think they went to Asheville
to buy me my birthday present.

458
00:44:11,883 --> 00:44:14,427
There was this bike I wanted,

459
00:44:15,011 --> 00:44:17,138
and Western Auto didn't carry it...

460
00:44:19,515 --> 00:44:22,268
so I think they went into Asheville
to get that bike for me.

461
00:44:23,311 --> 00:44:24,312
Oh.

462
00:44:25,146 --> 00:44:27,565
And I don't even remember
what kind of bike it was.

463
00:44:31,903 --> 00:44:33,363
It wasn't your fault.

464
00:44:44,999 --> 00:44:45,999
Oh!

465
00:44:48,795 --> 00:44:50,296
Oh, my gosh!

466
00:45:13,653 --> 00:45:15,154
Am I your girlfriend now?

467
00:45:15,238 --> 00:45:16,406
Do you wanna be?

468
00:45:17,699 --> 00:45:18,741
I know feathers.

469
00:45:20,576 --> 00:45:22,745
Bet the other girls don't know feathers.

470
00:45:24,789 --> 00:45:25,790
All right, then.

471
00:45:27,166 --> 00:45:28,167
All right, then.

472
00:46:40,907 --> 00:46:43,618
- I've never been out this way.
- It's worth the trip.

473
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,160
You'll see.

474
00:46:46,496 --> 00:46:47,497
Happy birthday, Kya.

475
00:46:50,917 --> 00:46:52,377
How'd you know it was my birthday?

476
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:54,045
Oh, I read it in your Bible.

477
00:46:56,714 --> 00:46:58,466
Did you know it was your birthday?

478
00:46:59,759 --> 00:47:01,094
Don't have a calendar.

479
00:47:04,847 --> 00:47:06,808
Oh, um, not my name.

480
00:47:06,891 --> 00:47:07,975
Don't cut my name.

481
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,185
Yes, ma'am.

482
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:22,907
- Mm!
- Pretty good, huh?

483
00:47:25,535 --> 00:47:26,619
What's that?

484
00:47:27,787 --> 00:47:29,080
Here they come.

485
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:39,966
Oh, wow.

486
00:47:41,384 --> 00:47:42,718
Snow geese.

487
00:48:15,293 --> 00:48:16,461
Kya.

488
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:18,504
Kya, look at me.

489
00:49:07,386 --> 00:49:08,471
Kya.

490
00:49:09,597 --> 00:49:11,724
Kya, I'm sorry.

491
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:13,434
I'm sorry.

492
00:49:15,102 --> 00:49:16,103
Jeez.

493
00:49:18,773 --> 00:49:20,900
No, Tate, I want to.

494
00:49:22,318 --> 00:49:23,318
Why not?

495
00:49:24,695 --> 00:49:25,695
Because I...

496
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:29,367
I care about you too much.

497
00:49:30,284 --> 00:49:36,165
Look, Kya. I want you more than anything,
but I can't be damaged as easily.

498
00:49:36,249 --> 00:49:38,834
It's more dangerous for you.
You understand?

499
00:49:52,181 --> 00:49:54,058
Fall gave way to winter.

500
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:56,269
Winter to spring.

501
00:49:57,812 --> 00:50:00,648
The only constant in nature is change.

502
00:50:00,731 --> 00:50:01,899
Dad, I got in!

503
00:50:24,589 --> 00:50:25,756
Why are you quiet?

504
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,510
You know I'm going away soon.

505
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:31,429
To college.

506
00:50:33,806 --> 00:50:35,016
You talked about it.

507
00:50:37,143 --> 00:50:38,143
When?

508
00:50:39,270 --> 00:50:40,688
Not right away.

509
00:50:43,524 --> 00:50:44,525
Soon.

510
00:50:45,818 --> 00:50:47,653
I got a job at the biology lab.

511
00:50:48,613 --> 00:50:50,114
Starts next week, so...

512
00:51:02,043 --> 00:51:03,044
Stay here.

513
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,171
And do what?

514
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,135
No, look. I just mean
there's no work for me here.

515
00:51:11,218 --> 00:51:14,013
What am I gonna do?
I don't want to be a shrimper like my dad.

516
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,682
I'm going to get a degree
and be something, Kya.

517
00:51:16,766 --> 00:51:19,101
- So could you.
- What do you want me to be?

518
00:51:20,603 --> 00:51:23,105
- That's not what I meant.
- You're never gonna come back.

519
00:51:23,189 --> 00:51:26,233
Yes, I will. I won't leave you, Kya.
I promise.

520
00:51:26,317 --> 00:51:27,652
I'm gonna come back to you.

521
00:51:28,694 --> 00:51:31,364
Kya! Kya, stop! Ky...

522
00:51:32,531 --> 00:51:34,950
You can't run away from every whip stitch!

523
00:51:55,763 --> 00:51:58,307
- One more night.
- One more night.

524
00:52:23,499 --> 00:52:24,500
What's this?

525
00:52:26,711 --> 00:52:29,004
It's a list of publishers.

526
00:52:30,005 --> 00:52:31,549
For all your drawings and notes.

527
00:52:31,632 --> 00:52:33,843
There's nothing like them out there, Kya.

528
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,053
There's enough for a book.

529
00:52:36,137 --> 00:52:37,513
Lots of books.

530
00:52:39,223 --> 00:52:41,392
And, you know,
you wouldn't have to leave home.

531
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:44,562
You could just mail your samples
into a publisher.

532
00:52:45,271 --> 00:52:46,814
You know, bring some money in.

533
00:52:48,232 --> 00:52:50,568
You know, probably not a huge amount...

534
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:54,780
but maybe you wouldn't have
to dig mussels the rest of your life.

535
00:52:56,407 --> 00:52:57,658
Just give it a try, Kya.

536
00:52:59,869 --> 00:53:01,203
Come on. What can it hurt?

537
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:06,792
You're gonna forget about me.

538
00:53:09,211 --> 00:53:11,338
When you get busy
with all that college stuff,

539
00:53:11,922 --> 00:53:13,215
all those pretty girls.

540
00:53:13,299 --> 00:53:15,092
I could never forget you, Kya.

541
00:53:15,968 --> 00:53:16,968
Ever.

542
00:53:19,388 --> 00:53:23,184
I'll be home in a month. I promise.
For the Fourth of July. Okay?

543
00:53:25,102 --> 00:53:26,520
I'll be back before you know it.

544
00:53:27,104 --> 00:53:29,899
We'll meet on your beach
and watch fireworks together.

545
00:53:30,441 --> 00:53:32,568
Just write those publishers, all right?

546
00:53:54,131 --> 00:53:55,132
Goodbye, Kya.

547
00:53:56,258 --> 00:53:57,343
Goodbye, Tate.

548
00:54:25,704 --> 00:54:27,873
Seabirds of the Eastern Seaboard.

549
00:54:29,166 --> 00:54:30,584
Starring you, Big Red.

550
00:56:32,122 --> 00:56:33,123
No.

551
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:38,629
No.

552
00:56:40,506 --> 00:56:41,548
No, Tate.

553
00:56:45,386 --> 00:56:46,428
No, no.

554
00:56:46,971 --> 00:56:47,972
No.

555
00:56:50,265 --> 00:56:51,265
No.

556
00:56:53,936 --> 00:56:54,936
No.

557
00:56:55,813 --> 00:56:58,482
No, no, no.

558
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:16,291
Tate and life
and love had been the same thing.

559
00:57:17,626 --> 00:57:18,836
They were all gone.

560
00:57:22,464 --> 00:57:23,465
And then...

561
00:57:46,113 --> 00:57:50,034
Whenever I stumbled, the marsh caught me.

562
00:57:57,583 --> 00:57:59,251
At some unclaimed moment,

563
00:57:59,334 --> 00:58:01,795
at last, the heart pain seeped away,

564
00:58:01,879 --> 00:58:03,839
like water into sand.

565
00:58:03,922 --> 00:58:05,674
Still there, but deep.

566
00:58:07,926 --> 00:58:11,555
There were no footprints
around the body or on the fire tower.

567
00:58:11,638 --> 00:58:13,432
And no fresh fingerprints either.

568
00:58:13,515 --> 00:58:16,393
Not even on the grate,
which somebody had to open.

569
00:58:16,477 --> 00:58:18,937
All this indicated
that someone had destroyed evidence.

570
00:58:19,021 --> 00:58:20,147
No more questions.

571
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:22,983
Your witness.

572
00:58:29,823 --> 00:58:33,452
Sheriff,
I'm handing you the tide table

573
00:58:33,535 --> 00:58:38,290
for the night of October 29
and the morning of October 30.

574
00:58:38,373 --> 00:58:43,670
Now, this shows here
that low tide was around midnight.

575
00:58:44,171 --> 00:58:48,175
So at the time
Chase Andrews arrived at the tower

576
00:58:48,258 --> 00:58:52,179
and walked to the steps,
he would have made tracks in the wet mud.

577
00:58:52,262 --> 00:58:57,518
And then as the groundwater rose,
those tracks would have been wiped out.

578
00:58:57,601 --> 00:59:00,437
- Do you agree that this is possible?
- Well...

579
00:59:00,521 --> 00:59:04,066
And then you'd agree
that if he had any friends with him,

580
00:59:04,149 --> 00:59:07,111
their footprints would be
washed away as well.

581
00:59:07,194 --> 00:59:09,488
Under these circumstances,

582
00:59:09,571 --> 00:59:15,577
the absence of footprints in
and of itself does not suggest a crime.

583
00:59:16,245 --> 00:59:17,246
Correct?

584
00:59:20,332 --> 00:59:21,332
Sheriff?

585
00:59:23,877 --> 00:59:28,715
The absence of footprints does not,
by itself, prove there was a crime.

586
00:59:28,799 --> 00:59:31,844
You also testified
that there were no fingerprints

587
00:59:31,927 --> 00:59:36,098
found anywhere in the fire tower,
including on the open grate.

588
00:59:36,849 --> 00:59:42,062
So this led you to conclude
that someone must have opened the grate

589
00:59:42,146 --> 00:59:44,565
and wiped away
their fingerprints afterwards.

590
00:59:44,648 --> 00:59:45,649
Correct.

591
00:59:46,733 --> 00:59:51,363
Now, in fact, isn't it true
that these grates were left open

592
00:59:51,446 --> 00:59:54,158
so often and considered so dangerous

593
00:59:54,241 --> 00:59:56,869
that your office submitted
a written request

594
00:59:56,952 --> 00:59:58,579
to the U.S. Forest Service

595
00:59:58,662 --> 01:00:03,917
to remedy the situation
on July 18 of last year?

596
01:00:06,712 --> 01:00:09,256
This is a copy of that request.

597
01:00:10,382 --> 01:00:12,634
Who wrote this, sheriff?

598
01:00:14,219 --> 01:00:15,262
I did it myself.

599
01:00:15,345 --> 01:00:19,057
Would you read to the court
the last sentence of this document

600
01:00:19,141 --> 01:00:21,310
that you sent to the Forest Service?

601
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,478
Just the last sentence.

602
01:00:24,188 --> 01:00:26,982
"I must repeat,
these grates are very dangerous,"

603
01:00:27,065 --> 01:00:28,775
and if action is not taken...

604
01:00:31,987 --> 01:00:35,616
"If action is not taken,
a serious injury or death will occur."

605
01:00:37,910 --> 01:00:39,453
Thank you, sheriff.

606
01:01:26,583 --> 01:01:29,169
Somebody's been taking pictures
round my house.

607
01:01:29,253 --> 01:01:30,921
What do you think they want?

608
01:01:31,672 --> 01:01:32,673
Developers.

609
01:01:33,882 --> 01:01:36,677
They've been all up and down
the marsh last few weeks,

610
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:39,596
wanting to drain the "murky swamp."
Build hotels.

611
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:41,056
Yeah, I saw them last year.

612
01:01:41,765 --> 01:01:44,601
Cutting oak and digging channels
down the way.

613
01:01:45,352 --> 01:01:46,353
They want my house?

614
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:47,896
Maybe not the house,

615
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:50,140
but I bet they offer you
a heap of money for that land.

616
01:01:50,190 --> 01:01:51,191
Jumpin'!

617
01:01:51,275 --> 01:01:53,694
There ain't nothing wrong
with some money going to Kya.

618
01:01:56,405 --> 01:01:59,533
You do own that land, don't you?
You own that house?

619
01:02:02,577 --> 01:02:03,870
Pa said so.

620
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:05,872
Well, you're gonna need some proof.

621
01:02:05,956 --> 01:02:08,125
A deed, title.

622
01:02:12,838 --> 01:02:13,839
Hey.

623
01:02:13,922 --> 01:02:16,591
Sorry to startle you.
Can I carry that for ya?

624
01:02:17,384 --> 01:02:20,345
- I got it.
- Please. Let me get it.

625
01:02:21,805 --> 01:02:23,390
Oh, I'm Chase Andrews.

626
01:02:24,766 --> 01:02:26,226
Your name's Kya, right?

627
01:02:27,894 --> 01:02:31,773
Yeah. Yeah. It's a nice name.
I like it. It's different but nice.

628
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:35,736
This is yours right here.

629
01:02:37,738 --> 01:02:38,864
There we go.

630
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:44,494
You wanna go for a picnic
in my boat this Sunday?

631
01:02:50,584 --> 01:02:51,710
Okay.

632
01:02:51,793 --> 01:02:54,379
I'll pick you up at noon
from Point Beach. Does that work?

633
01:02:55,589 --> 01:02:57,591
All right. Well, I'll see ya, Kya.

634
01:03:09,269 --> 01:03:10,395
Well, here we are.

635
01:03:10,479 --> 01:03:14,691
Mr. Napier Clark, looks like,
bought it in 1897.

636
01:03:15,275 --> 01:03:17,569
Yeah, uh, that's my grandpa.

637
01:03:18,403 --> 01:03:19,488
Yes, ma'am.

638
01:03:20,197 --> 01:03:25,202
It's never been sold, so, yes sirree,
I reckon it belongs to you.

639
01:03:25,827 --> 01:03:29,498
Looks like you gotta pay some back taxes
if you wanna keep it, Miss Clark.

640
01:03:30,082 --> 01:03:32,417
In fact, ma'am, the way the law reads, uh,

641
01:03:32,501 --> 01:03:36,129
whoever comes along and pays
those back taxes owns the land,

642
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:37,923
even if they don't got no deed.

643
01:03:38,882 --> 01:03:40,008
Well, how much?

644
01:03:40,092 --> 01:03:41,885
Looks like about...

645
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:48,141
Eight hundred dollars total.

646
01:04:05,659 --> 01:04:07,160
Five years.

647
01:04:08,453 --> 01:04:11,706
It had been five years
since Tate showed me this path.

648
01:04:12,541 --> 01:04:14,084
Dear Sir or Madam,

649
01:04:15,168 --> 01:04:20,048
I am sending you the following pages
on the shells of the Carolina marsh

650
01:04:20,507 --> 01:04:22,008
for your consideration.

651
01:04:24,886 --> 01:04:27,764
Five years for my heart
to open its shell again.

652
01:04:39,401 --> 01:04:41,736
How's it feel to bask
in the presence of musical genius?

653
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:50,036
Hey, look.

654
01:04:52,706 --> 01:04:55,750
Oh. Oh! That's an ornate scallop.

655
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:57,878
Pecten ornatus.

656
01:04:57,961 --> 01:04:59,129
All right.

657
01:05:00,505 --> 01:05:03,633
- Well, it's unusual to find one here.
- Really?

658
01:05:04,426 --> 01:05:07,721
Yeah. This particular species usually
inhabits regions south of here

659
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:10,432
'cause these waters are too cool for them.

660
01:05:12,809 --> 01:05:13,809
What?

661
01:05:14,478 --> 01:05:18,648
Oh, no, it's just, the Marsh Girl knows
the Latin name for shells

662
01:05:19,274 --> 01:05:21,902
and where they inhabit and why,
for Christ sakes.

663
01:05:23,445 --> 01:05:24,529
Here. You keep it.

664
01:05:27,532 --> 01:05:28,533
Thank you.

665
01:05:33,663 --> 01:05:35,165
You're something else, ain't ya?

666
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:02,234
I know you think I'm trash,
but I'm worth more than a picnic.

667
01:06:02,317 --> 01:06:03,610
Oh, no, Kya. Come on.

668
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:06,655
I'm sorry. No. Hey, come on.
I've never thought you were trash.

669
01:06:07,822 --> 01:06:08,907
Please. I'm sorry.

670
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:11,910
I understand if you wanna go,
but you can't walk from here.

671
01:06:11,993 --> 01:06:12,993
It's too far.

672
01:06:13,662 --> 01:06:15,080
Can I make it up to you?

673
01:06:17,666 --> 01:06:19,668
Please, can I make it up to you?

674
01:06:22,337 --> 01:06:24,548
I can't believe
you never been up the fire tower.

675
01:06:24,631 --> 01:06:27,884
Come here when my family's
all in my business. You know?

676
01:06:29,427 --> 01:06:31,930
It's a great way to see
the whole marsh from above.

677
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:38,394
Here.

678
01:07:03,837 --> 01:07:04,879
What is it?

679
01:07:06,673 --> 01:07:08,925
You can tell me. I won't laugh at you.

680
01:07:10,218 --> 01:07:15,098
It's like having a friend your whole life,
but you never saw their full face.

681
01:07:17,642 --> 01:07:18,643
Now I see it.

682
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:26,735
Your house is over there, ain't it?

683
01:07:30,989 --> 01:07:32,032
Take me there.

684
01:07:32,782 --> 01:07:33,783
Oh, um...

685
01:07:34,951 --> 01:07:37,329
- It's far.
- Hey, I like far.

686
01:07:39,039 --> 01:07:41,833
I don't care what it's like,
if that's what you're worried about.

687
01:07:48,506 --> 01:07:49,883
Is this it right here?

688
01:07:52,927 --> 01:07:55,096
How long you lived out here by yourself?

689
01:07:55,180 --> 01:07:56,890
Uh, about ten years, I think.

690
01:07:57,932 --> 01:07:58,932
Neat.

691
01:07:59,601 --> 01:08:02,145
Living out here with no parents
telling you what to do?

692
01:08:04,856 --> 01:08:07,150
There's really nothing to see inside.

693
01:08:10,278 --> 01:08:12,322
- Wow, what you got on the porch?
- What?

694
01:08:12,906 --> 01:08:14,741
Oh, um, nothing.

695
01:08:25,669 --> 01:08:27,045
What is all this?

696
01:08:28,213 --> 01:08:29,255
Nothing.

697
01:08:35,804 --> 01:08:38,348
What, you writing a book or something?

698
01:08:39,766 --> 01:08:40,767
Sort of.

699
01:08:41,893 --> 01:08:44,437
These look straight out
of an encyclopedia.

700
01:08:47,565 --> 01:08:49,192
You're the real deal, ain't ya?

701
01:08:52,821 --> 01:08:53,863
Ah, swanee.

702
01:08:54,531 --> 01:08:56,282
You got a water pump.

703
01:08:58,201 --> 01:08:59,619
I wasn't ready for guests.

704
01:08:59,703 --> 01:09:00,912
Hey, don't worry.

705
01:09:04,416 --> 01:09:07,460
Hey, there's nobody I know
who could live out here alone like this.

706
01:09:08,336 --> 01:09:10,630
I mean, most guys would be too scared.

707
01:09:14,092 --> 01:09:15,176
What do you want with me?

708
01:09:20,223 --> 01:09:23,643
Okay. Look, I'm real sorry
I came on like that.

709
01:09:23,727 --> 01:09:26,396
I wanna get to know you better. All right?

710
01:09:26,479 --> 01:09:27,981
I think you're gorgeous.

711
01:09:29,399 --> 01:09:33,445
I do. I think you're free as a dang gale
and smart as a whip.

712
01:09:35,363 --> 01:09:37,657
But I won't do anything
unless you want me to.

713
01:09:38,992 --> 01:09:39,992
How's that?

714
01:09:43,329 --> 01:09:44,330
That's fine.

715
01:09:45,957 --> 01:09:47,125
All right.

716
01:09:58,470 --> 01:10:01,181
I didn't know
exactly how I felt about Chase.

717
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:03,683
But I was no longer lonely.

718
01:10:04,559 --> 01:10:05,852
That seemed enough.

719
01:10:08,062 --> 01:10:09,481
Is that for your book?

720
01:10:10,440 --> 01:10:11,441
Yeah.

721
01:10:12,358 --> 01:10:14,694
Anyway, who knows if anyone will read it.

722
01:10:15,487 --> 01:10:16,487
I will.

723
01:10:17,614 --> 01:10:19,282
The marsh was our secret.

724
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:31,211
Tell me about your friends.

725
01:10:31,419 --> 01:10:33,338
Oh, I don't really have any friends.

726
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:38,635
You always seem to be having
a good time when you're with them.

727
01:10:38,718 --> 01:10:39,719
You spying on me?

728
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:46,434
It's funny. My dad told me once,

729
01:10:46,518 --> 01:10:50,313
he'd had something to drink
and a fight with my mom.

730
01:10:51,731 --> 01:10:55,360
He told me if my friends really knew me,
they wouldn't be my friends.

731
01:10:57,278 --> 01:11:02,742
I don't know if anyone really knows me,
is what I'm saying, I guess.

732
01:11:07,247 --> 01:11:09,082
I wonder what makes the sky blue.

733
01:11:11,042 --> 01:11:13,378
Blue and violet wavelengths from sunlight.

734
01:11:14,671 --> 01:11:19,551
They, uh, bounce off the gas particles
in the atmosphere and scatter.

735
01:11:27,016 --> 01:11:28,226
Is it okay if I...

736
01:11:29,769 --> 01:11:30,770
kiss you now?

737
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:45,243
Let's turn
to the red wool fibers found

738
01:11:45,326 --> 01:11:47,120
on Chase Andrews' denim jacket

739
01:11:47,203 --> 01:11:48,454
the night he died.

740
01:11:49,414 --> 01:11:52,625
Did you compare those samples
to this red ski cap?

741
01:11:52,709 --> 01:11:53,710
Exhibit C.

742
01:11:53,793 --> 01:11:57,839
Yes. The fibers from the cap
and the jacket matched exactly.

743
01:11:57,922 --> 01:11:59,674
And where was that cap found?

744
01:11:59,757 --> 01:12:02,302
It was found
in Miss Clark's residence.

745
01:12:04,012 --> 01:12:07,599
Now, about these red fibers,
is there any way, doctor,

746
01:12:07,682 --> 01:12:10,560
to determine how long
the fibers had been on the jacket?

747
01:12:10,643 --> 01:12:14,272
No. We can tell
where they came from, not when.

748
01:12:14,355 --> 01:12:16,482
And if someone wore this hat often,

749
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:20,153
is it possible the fibers would be
in their hair and on their clothes?

750
01:12:20,236 --> 01:12:23,531
Yes. I would suppose they could.

751
01:12:23,615 --> 01:12:27,243
So would you agree
that at any time during the years

752
01:12:27,327 --> 01:12:29,954
that the defendant, Miss Clark,
knew Chase Andrews,

753
01:12:30,038 --> 01:12:33,666
the fibers of the hat could have been
transferred onto Chase's jacket?

754
01:12:33,750 --> 01:12:36,294
From what I've seen, yes.

755
01:12:36,377 --> 01:12:39,714
- At any time they met.
- Yes.

756
01:12:55,480 --> 01:12:59,400
"Dear Miss Clark,
we were fascinated by your manuscript."

757
01:13:00,151 --> 01:13:03,279
If, as you say,
your materials are already complete,

758
01:13:03,905 --> 01:13:06,950
"we hope to edit
and publish in record time."

759
01:13:12,830 --> 01:13:16,250
Hey. You're looking
at the new manager of Western Auto.

760
01:13:18,336 --> 01:13:19,545
Oh, Chase, that's...

761
01:13:20,505 --> 01:13:22,632
- That's great news.
- Come on. Let's celebrate.

762
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:38,564
So they're gonna, uh,
pay you for those drawings?

763
01:13:38,648 --> 01:13:39,649
Yeah.

764
01:13:41,025 --> 01:13:42,110
Ooh!

765
01:13:45,655 --> 01:13:47,740
Just don't get too full of yourself,
I guess.

766
01:13:48,950 --> 01:13:49,951
I wouldn't.

767
01:13:54,038 --> 01:13:56,249
I know people have disappointed you.

768
01:13:57,667 --> 01:13:59,210
And I'm sorry for that.

769
01:14:00,628 --> 01:14:02,755
Getting left by your own family. I mean...

770
01:14:04,048 --> 01:14:07,593
God, my family's a pain in the ass,
but I don't think I could take that.

771
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:10,596
But I want you to know
that I'm gonna take care of you.

772
01:14:12,473 --> 01:14:13,725
Now I've been promoted,

773
01:14:13,808 --> 01:14:15,852
I can get you a nice house
when we're married.

774
01:14:15,935 --> 01:14:17,437
- "Married"?
- Yeah.

775
01:14:18,062 --> 01:14:21,315
A nice two-story on the beach
with a wraparound veranda.

776
01:14:22,567 --> 01:14:23,651
Yeah.

777
01:14:27,071 --> 01:14:28,698
What about your parents?

778
01:14:28,781 --> 01:14:30,241
Have you told them about me?

779
01:14:30,950 --> 01:14:32,702
What you gotta understand about my folks

780
01:14:32,785 --> 01:14:35,747
is that if I say you're my choice,
that'd be that.

781
01:14:36,372 --> 01:14:38,624
They'll fall in love with you
when they get to know ya.

782
01:14:43,254 --> 01:14:44,255
Come here.

783
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:55,183
Oh, by the way, I have to drive over
to Asheville in a few days

784
01:14:55,266 --> 01:14:57,268
to buy goods for my dad's store.

785
01:14:57,351 --> 01:14:59,187
I was thinking you could come.

786
01:14:59,979 --> 01:15:01,814
- Celebrate your book and all.
- Oh...

787
01:15:03,274 --> 01:15:05,234
- There'd be lots of people.
- It doesn't matter.

788
01:15:05,318 --> 01:15:07,111
You'd be with me. I know everything.

789
01:15:07,904 --> 01:15:10,656
Hell, you don't have to talk to one soul
if you don't want to.

790
01:15:11,532 --> 01:15:14,869
Come on. If we're gonna get married,
you need to get out in the world a bit.

791
01:15:16,037 --> 01:15:18,039
Spread those long wings of yours.

792
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:22,001
Come on. It'll be fun.

793
01:15:30,301 --> 01:15:33,846
It's a two-day job,
so we'll stay the night.

794
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:40,728
Hold my head up high

795
01:15:43,022 --> 01:15:44,315
Incredible, huh?

796
01:15:45,483 --> 01:15:47,985
Makes me feel sweet inside

797
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,796
Hey. It's an adventure. Come on.

798
01:17:29,629 --> 01:17:34,133
It'll feel better for you later,
the more you do it.

799
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,760
Oh.

800
01:17:42,850 --> 01:17:44,560
Hey, I never wanna lose you.

801
01:17:48,564 --> 01:17:50,358
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

802
01:17:51,692 --> 01:17:53,069
I think about it a lot.

803
01:17:54,695 --> 01:17:56,989
Sneaking out at night to come see you.

804
01:17:58,950 --> 01:17:59,951
My Marsh Girl.

805
01:18:03,955 --> 01:18:06,040
Nobody knows

806
01:18:07,041 --> 01:18:08,668
Nobody sees

807
01:18:09,627 --> 01:18:12,171
Nobody knows but me

808
01:18:15,841 --> 01:18:19,637
Hey, you don't have to prove yourself
to anyone. You understand?

809
01:18:21,138 --> 01:18:22,807
You have me, and I love you.

810
01:18:26,644 --> 01:18:27,895
I made you something.

811
01:18:38,572 --> 01:18:39,573
Oh.

812
01:18:42,827 --> 01:18:44,620
It was a single shell,

813
01:18:44,704 --> 01:18:48,332
hung on a piece of rawhide,
tied in a tight knot, and it was missing.

814
01:18:48,416 --> 01:18:52,753
So to be clear, what you're
saying is that the shell necklace

815
01:18:52,837 --> 01:18:56,674
that Chase wore every day
was missing from these items

816
01:18:56,757 --> 01:19:00,886
that law enforcement recovered
from his body the day that he was found.

817
01:19:01,387 --> 01:19:02,638
Is that correct?

818
01:19:02,722 --> 01:19:05,099
- I think it's important.
- Yes.

819
01:19:05,850 --> 01:19:09,103
He had that necklace on
when he had dinner with us that night.

820
01:19:10,396 --> 01:19:13,190
And it was gone from his body.

821
01:19:14,608 --> 01:19:16,610
And what I'm saying is
he never took it off.

822
01:19:17,111 --> 01:19:19,155
Whoever killed him took it.

823
01:19:19,238 --> 01:19:22,366
Objection, Your Honor. It's speculation.

824
01:19:22,450 --> 01:19:23,576
Sustained.

825
01:19:24,076 --> 01:19:25,578
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

826
01:19:25,661 --> 01:19:29,457
you will disregard
that last remark by Mrs. Andrews.

827
01:19:29,540 --> 01:19:34,003
Mrs. Andrews,
where did Chase get this necklace?

828
01:19:34,086 --> 01:19:37,798
It's from that Marsh Girl.
Miss Clark.

829
01:19:38,466 --> 01:19:41,344
I didn't even know her name
or if she even had one.

830
01:19:42,803 --> 01:19:44,305
I can't see why Chase...

831
01:19:45,473 --> 01:19:46,849
But what I'm saying is,

832
01:19:47,433 --> 01:19:51,604
she's the only one who'd have
any interest in taking the thing.

833
01:19:51,687 --> 01:19:53,230
Mrs. Andrews...

834
01:19:55,483 --> 01:19:58,402
were Chase and Miss Clark
romantically involved?

835
01:19:58,486 --> 01:20:01,447
You could say.
I saw him sneaking out at night.

836
01:20:02,114 --> 01:20:05,368
When I finally asked him
where he was going, he told me the truth.

837
01:20:06,577 --> 01:20:09,288
I thought: What would people say?

838
01:20:10,748 --> 01:20:14,293
I was a silly woman
to be worried about that next to...

839
01:20:20,007 --> 01:20:23,594
But he told me he broke it off with her.

840
01:20:24,470 --> 01:20:28,140
She knew she couldn't have him anymore,
so she killed him

841
01:20:28,224 --> 01:20:30,684
- and took back her ugly necklace!
- Objection, Your Honor.

842
01:20:34,271 --> 01:20:35,106
Sustained.

843
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:36,941
No further questions,
Your Honor.

844
01:20:40,653 --> 01:20:44,698
Um, Mrs. Andrews, you have
my deepest sympathy for your loss.

845
01:20:45,324 --> 01:20:47,410
With all due respect,

846
01:20:47,493 --> 01:20:52,206
you are aware that Miss Clark's house
was thoroughly searched.

847
01:20:53,165 --> 01:20:56,794
And that the police did not find
the necklace there.

848
01:20:56,877 --> 01:20:59,296
- Did they?
- No.

849
01:21:21,569 --> 01:21:22,570
Hey.

850
01:21:23,487 --> 01:21:24,864
- I got it.
- Hey.

851
01:21:25,698 --> 01:21:28,367
- Almost got you.
- Almost knocked me out.

852
01:21:28,451 --> 01:21:30,411
Just trying to show off.

853
01:21:32,079 --> 01:21:34,748
What's that Marsh Girl like
in bed, man? Is she an animal?

854
01:21:34,832 --> 01:21:37,543
Wild as a bobcat and worth
every bit of the gas money.

855
01:21:38,085 --> 01:21:39,420
Tell me her eyes glow.

856
01:21:39,545 --> 01:21:42,665
- Only for me and only when I make them.
- Hey, don't talk about her like that.

857
01:21:44,258 --> 01:21:47,136
- What's that?
- I said don't talk about her like that.

858
01:21:47,219 --> 01:21:49,013
Oh, the college boy.

859
01:21:51,140 --> 01:21:53,726
- He taught the Marsh Girl her ABCs.
- Oh.

860
01:21:53,809 --> 01:21:55,603
- Mmm.
- You're a waste of her time.

861
01:21:57,605 --> 01:21:59,773
Go ahead, college boy. What you gonna do?

862
01:21:59,857 --> 01:22:03,110
- Come on, you're tough, right?
- Come on, let's do something.

863
01:22:03,194 --> 01:22:06,489
- You wanna hit me?
- Hey, y'all settle down now.

864
01:22:06,572 --> 01:22:07,573
That's enough.

865
01:22:09,658 --> 01:22:11,827
Settle down before someone get hurt.

866
01:22:12,828 --> 01:22:14,121
There's better ways than this.

867
01:22:34,433 --> 01:22:35,518
Hey, Kya.

868
01:22:38,479 --> 01:22:39,479
Hey, what the hell?

869
01:22:40,231 --> 01:22:42,399
Wait! Kya, wait! Please.

870
01:22:42,483 --> 01:22:43,567
Look, I just wanna talk.

871
01:22:43,651 --> 01:22:45,528
Get out of my lagoon, you dirty creep!

872
01:22:45,611 --> 01:22:47,446
Kya, please! I just need to talk to you!

873
01:22:47,530 --> 01:22:49,156
I don't care what you want!

874
01:22:49,865 --> 01:22:52,451
I never wanna see you again. Ever.

875
01:22:52,535 --> 01:22:54,453
Kya, I need to talk to you
about Chase, okay?

876
01:22:54,537 --> 01:22:57,289
- About Chase?
- He's not good enough for you.

877
01:22:58,958 --> 01:23:01,752
You're the one who left me.

878
01:23:03,587 --> 01:23:07,341
Who didn't come back when you promised.
Who never came back.

879
01:23:09,885 --> 01:23:14,098
You didn't even write to explain
or even to say if you were alive or dead.

880
01:23:14,181 --> 01:23:15,391
You just disappeared.

881
01:23:15,474 --> 01:23:18,811
I know. And I'm so sorry, Kya,
you have no idea.

882
01:23:18,894 --> 01:23:22,314
You weren't man enough to face me.

883
01:23:23,566 --> 01:23:24,692
You're right, Kya.

884
01:23:25,985 --> 01:23:27,611
Everything you say is true.

885
01:23:28,487 --> 01:23:30,948
Leaving you like that was
the worst thing I've ever done,

886
01:23:31,031 --> 01:23:32,741
the worst thing I'll ever do in my life.

887
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:37,705
I knew how badly I'd hurt you,
and I couldn't face you, like you said.

888
01:23:40,416 --> 01:23:45,045
I thought you wouldn't be able to leave
the marsh and live in any other world.

889
01:23:45,879 --> 01:23:49,925
You know, I thought I had to choose
between you and everything else.

890
01:23:50,009 --> 01:23:52,678
But the truth is, Kya,
everything else that I thought mattered,

891
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:55,931
the scholarships, the grants, the jobs,
it means nothing without you.

892
01:23:58,559 --> 01:23:59,768
I was so wrong.

893
01:24:00,811 --> 01:24:02,396
I've been sorry for years.

894
01:24:04,982 --> 01:24:07,234
And I'll be sorry for the rest of my life.

895
01:24:18,203 --> 01:24:19,203
You look...

896
01:24:31,425 --> 01:24:32,843
I brought you something.

897
01:24:50,653 --> 01:24:53,822
You know, I'm working
at the new lab near town.

898
01:24:55,115 --> 01:24:56,742
You'd love it, Kya.

899
01:24:56,825 --> 01:24:58,994
I get to study all this
under a microscope.

900
01:25:02,331 --> 01:25:03,457
So I'm here now.

901
01:25:05,876 --> 01:25:07,002
I'm back for good.

902
01:25:17,054 --> 01:25:19,098
Kya, I would do anything to...

903
01:25:22,267 --> 01:25:24,478
I would've done
so many things differently.

904
01:25:33,153 --> 01:25:35,072
What do you want now, Tate?

905
01:25:35,155 --> 01:25:37,908
Is there any way
that you could possibly forgive me, Kya?

906
01:25:40,327 --> 01:25:41,327
Please?

907
01:25:44,331 --> 01:25:45,708
I don't know how.

908
01:26:08,981 --> 01:26:13,068
Kya, I trust you would tell me
if you knew of anyone else

909
01:26:13,152 --> 01:26:15,738
who had reason to harm Chase Andrews.

910
01:26:20,409 --> 01:26:22,161
Well, all right, then.

911
01:26:22,911 --> 01:26:24,329
Try and get some rest.

912
01:26:30,878 --> 01:26:32,588
Oh. Hi.

913
01:26:32,671 --> 01:26:34,798
Hey. What you doing in town?

914
01:26:34,882 --> 01:26:38,802
I had some good news from the publisher,
so I thought we could celebrate.

915
01:26:39,094 --> 01:26:40,679
- Was gonna make...
- There he is.

916
01:26:48,312 --> 01:26:50,314
Kya, you know Brian, Tina, Pearl.

917
01:26:51,148 --> 01:26:53,734
- You guys know Kya.
- Sure, yeah, the Marsh Girl.

918
01:26:54,401 --> 01:26:56,153
Pleased to meet you, Kya.

919
01:26:56,779 --> 01:26:58,614
I'm Chase's fiancée.

920
01:27:00,908 --> 01:27:03,243
All right. Well, I'll see you around, Kya.

921
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,118
Kya!

922
01:27:46,286 --> 01:27:47,996
Hey, Kya. I can explain.

923
01:27:51,083 --> 01:27:52,167
Are you in there?

924
01:27:54,253 --> 01:27:55,671
Hey, I just wanna talk.

925
01:27:57,339 --> 01:27:58,465
Kya!

926
01:28:01,969 --> 01:28:03,262
I know you're here, damn it!

927
01:28:09,268 --> 01:28:10,268
Kya!

928
01:29:05,032 --> 01:29:06,658
I had to do life alone.

929
01:29:09,036 --> 01:29:10,120
But I knew that.

930
01:29:11,788 --> 01:29:13,457
I'd known for a long time.

931
01:29:15,626 --> 01:29:16,835
People don't stay.

932
01:29:29,264 --> 01:29:30,349
"Dear Miss Clark,"

933
01:29:30,974 --> 01:29:33,936
enclosed is the final copy
of your beautiful book,

934
01:29:34,519 --> 01:29:36,855
along with the initial check for delivery,

935
01:29:36,939 --> 01:29:38,815
with royalties to follow, I'm sure.

936
01:29:40,317 --> 01:29:42,611
I'm attending a conference
in Greenville next month

937
01:29:42,694 --> 01:29:45,822
"and would love for you to join us
and celebrate this great accomplishment."

938
01:29:54,581 --> 01:29:57,334
"A full deed for Catherine Danielle Clark"

939
01:29:57,417 --> 01:30:02,714
for 310 acres of lagoons,
marsh, oak forests and beach.

940
01:30:03,298 --> 01:30:06,385
"Wasteland category: murky swamp."

941
01:30:27,906 --> 01:30:28,824
Jodie?

942
01:30:28,907 --> 01:30:32,244
There I am in Asheville,
and I see your book in a shop:

943
01:30:32,995 --> 01:30:34,454
Catherine Danielle Clark.

944
01:30:34,538 --> 01:30:39,334
And my heart just broke
and leapt for joy all at once.

945
01:30:39,418 --> 01:30:41,253
I knew I had to find you.

946
01:30:42,087 --> 01:30:43,880
I just didn't think you'd still be here.

947
01:30:44,965 --> 01:30:46,299
What about the others?

948
01:30:47,134 --> 01:30:49,594
I don't know a thing
about Murph, Mandy or Missy.

949
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:52,639
I wouldn't know them
if I passed them in the street.

950
01:30:53,265 --> 01:30:54,266
And, um...

951
01:30:56,268 --> 01:30:57,352
what about Ma?

952
01:31:00,480 --> 01:31:02,315
Ma passed, Kya.

953
01:31:10,657 --> 01:31:12,993
Ma had a sister, Rosemary.

954
01:31:13,076 --> 01:31:15,954
She found me in the Army
and told me what happened.

955
01:31:16,038 --> 01:31:19,249
Showed up at Rosemary's door
in her alligator shoes.

956
01:31:19,332 --> 01:31:21,960
Rosemary said she didn't talk for months.

957
01:31:22,044 --> 01:31:24,921
And then about a year later,
she remembered she had children.

958
01:31:25,005 --> 01:31:28,550
Rosemary helped her write a letter to Pa,
asking if she could come get us.

959
01:31:30,093 --> 01:31:32,637
And he told her
if she ever so much as contacted us again,

960
01:31:32,721 --> 01:31:34,431
he'd beat us unrecognizable.

961
01:31:35,932 --> 01:31:37,517
Yeah, sounds like Pa.

962
01:31:37,601 --> 01:31:40,020
She saved up for lawyers and everything,

963
01:31:40,771 --> 01:31:42,272
but then she got sick.

964
01:31:42,355 --> 01:31:43,356
Leukemia.

965
01:31:44,274 --> 01:31:45,275
She tried, but...

966
01:31:45,358 --> 01:31:46,777
She never had a chance.

967
01:31:49,446 --> 01:31:50,781
I've been waiting...

968
01:31:52,324 --> 01:31:54,493
all these years
for her to walk down the lane.

969
01:31:56,328 --> 01:31:58,747
You didn't have a family your whole life,

970
01:31:59,581 --> 01:32:02,042
and there's nothing I can do
to give you that back.

971
01:32:03,043 --> 01:32:06,797
But I'd like to come see you
as much as I can get up here.

972
01:32:11,927 --> 01:32:13,345
Yeah, I'd like that.

973
01:32:50,715 --> 01:32:52,342
Mabel's gonna be so proud.

974
01:32:52,425 --> 01:32:53,802
Just one more thing.

975
01:32:56,471 --> 01:32:58,223
I'll be sure he gets it.

976
01:32:59,558 --> 01:33:00,725
Thank you, Jumpin'.

977
01:33:05,730 --> 01:33:06,982
How y'all doing?

978
01:33:07,065 --> 01:33:09,901
One pack of your finest, please, sir.

979
01:33:09,985 --> 01:33:11,486
And give me some matches.

980
01:33:11,570 --> 01:33:13,572
- Sure thing.
- "Sure thing."

981
01:33:15,198 --> 01:33:16,783
Kya Clark.

982
01:33:17,409 --> 01:33:19,161
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

983
01:33:19,244 --> 01:33:21,121
You wrote a damn book. Come here.

984
01:33:21,204 --> 01:33:23,123
Wait, wait, wait. I wanna talk to you.

985
01:33:23,206 --> 01:33:25,125
Don't act like that. Come on.

986
01:33:26,001 --> 01:33:27,169
Leave me alone.

987
01:33:30,130 --> 01:33:32,841
Damn, the Marsh Girl thinks
she's too good for you now.

988
01:33:33,466 --> 01:33:34,467
Shut up!

989
01:33:34,551 --> 01:33:36,803
Here you go, sir. It's on the house.

990
01:33:46,271 --> 01:33:47,856
Thought I might find you here.

991
01:33:49,232 --> 01:33:50,609
I told you to leave me alone.

992
01:33:50,692 --> 01:33:54,112
No, I know, but I just...
Listen, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

993
01:33:54,196 --> 01:33:57,616
Really. I feel bad about
how things turned out.

994
01:33:58,825 --> 01:34:00,285
"How things turned out"?

995
01:34:01,745 --> 01:34:03,371
What, you mean how it turned out

996
01:34:03,455 --> 01:34:05,790
you were engaged
the whole time we were together?

997
01:34:06,833 --> 01:34:10,420
How it turned out
that you lie to everybody?

998
01:34:10,503 --> 01:34:13,006
Kya, I have to do things
I don't wanna do. You know that.

999
01:34:13,089 --> 01:34:16,176
No, I have to get married
to someone like Pearl. I had to.

1000
01:34:16,259 --> 01:34:18,053
But you're the one I really want.

1001
01:34:22,390 --> 01:34:24,643
You know any other man
would have tried to change you?

1002
01:34:25,435 --> 01:34:26,561
To fix you?

1003
01:34:27,896 --> 01:34:29,147
I never did.

1004
01:34:30,649 --> 01:34:33,401
No, no. Please, please, wait.
I need you. I really need you.

1005
01:34:34,986 --> 01:34:36,905
Don't leave me all alone in that place.

1006
01:34:37,739 --> 01:34:39,074
You know, nobody else knows me.

1007
01:34:43,620 --> 01:34:45,455
You know, I feel sorry for you.

1008
01:34:47,624 --> 01:34:49,793
But I want nothing to do with any of that.

1009
01:35:04,015 --> 01:35:05,183
Wilder than ever.

1010
01:35:09,354 --> 01:35:10,855
I know you want this too.

1011
01:35:10,939 --> 01:35:12,816
- Stop!
- I know you want this too.

1012
01:35:18,863 --> 01:35:21,741
You're mine, Kya. You belong to me.
I'm not letting you go this time.

1013
01:35:42,554 --> 01:35:44,723
Leave me alone, you bastard!

1014
01:35:46,099 --> 01:35:49,102
You bother me again and I'll kill you!

1015
01:35:49,894 --> 01:35:52,022
She shouted it real loud, sir.

1016
01:35:52,105 --> 01:35:54,149
I heard a commotion, and I come closer,

1017
01:35:54,232 --> 01:35:57,360
see if anybody was in trouble,
and there she was.

1018
01:35:57,444 --> 01:35:59,404
And do you recognize the woman?

1019
01:36:00,196 --> 01:36:03,700
Is she in the courtroom today?

1020
01:36:03,783 --> 01:36:06,077
Yes, that one there. The defendant.

1021
01:36:06,161 --> 01:36:08,663
The one folks call Marsh Girl.

1022
01:36:14,085 --> 01:36:16,880
I finally understood why
Ma had to leave.

1023
01:37:23,738 --> 01:37:25,407
One thing I learned from Pa,

1024
01:37:26,074 --> 01:37:28,326
these men have to have the last punch.

1025
01:37:56,229 --> 01:37:58,022
Being isolated was one thing.

1026
01:37:59,190 --> 01:38:02,068
Living in fear, quite another.

1027
01:38:04,070 --> 01:38:05,989
I will never live like that.

1028
01:38:07,198 --> 01:38:11,077
A life wondering
when the next fist will fall.

1029
01:38:33,099 --> 01:38:34,350
Tate, you can't be here.

1030
01:38:34,976 --> 01:38:36,436
I just wanted to check on you.

1031
01:38:36,519 --> 01:38:39,022
- Jumpin' said he hadn't seen you since...
- Not now.

1032
01:38:40,690 --> 01:38:42,275
Kya, what happened to your face?

1033
01:38:43,067 --> 01:38:45,570
Was it Chase?
Tell me, Kya. Did he do this?

1034
01:38:45,653 --> 01:38:47,280
I need you to stay out of it.

1035
01:38:47,363 --> 01:38:48,698
That son of a bitch.

1036
01:38:49,491 --> 01:38:52,243
- That son of a bitch.
- Tate, I need you to go.

1037
01:38:52,327 --> 01:38:53,578
Kya.

1038
01:39:00,168 --> 01:39:02,253
You know, I was gonna go
to Greenville next week.

1039
01:39:05,507 --> 01:39:07,133
Finally meet my publishers.

1040
01:39:09,344 --> 01:39:10,929
Talk about the next book.

1041
01:39:11,554 --> 01:39:12,889
I was feeling brave enough.

1042
01:39:13,389 --> 01:39:15,016
Well, you can still go.

1043
01:39:15,099 --> 01:39:16,684
Looking like this?

1044
01:39:16,768 --> 01:39:18,520
Don't let him ruin this for you.

1045
01:39:19,729 --> 01:39:20,813
Go to Greenville.

1046
01:39:21,731 --> 01:39:23,316
Okay? There's a bus.

1047
01:39:23,399 --> 01:39:25,193
It's easy. Jumpin's got the schedule.

1048
01:39:26,110 --> 01:39:27,904
Let them put you up in a nice hotel,

1049
01:39:28,571 --> 01:39:30,782
eat some hot restaurant food
you didn't have to make.

1050
01:39:30,865 --> 01:39:32,742
Stay a week, if you can.

1051
01:39:33,743 --> 01:39:36,621
And I'll come see you
when you're back. Okay?

1052
01:39:37,664 --> 01:39:39,457
Hear how it all went with the publishers.

1053
01:39:40,291 --> 01:39:41,417
All right.

1054
01:39:48,925 --> 01:39:49,926
Hey, you cold?

1055
01:39:51,761 --> 01:39:54,681
I'm fine. I don't need you
to take care of me.

1056
01:39:54,764 --> 01:39:56,641
I know, but just take my hat.

1057
01:39:57,267 --> 01:39:59,394
- I said I don't need your help.
- Just take it.

1058
01:40:28,256 --> 01:40:30,800
You wanna tell me
what happened to your eye?

1059
01:40:32,135 --> 01:40:34,220
I need to write down the bus schedule.

1060
01:40:34,304 --> 01:40:35,805
You have a copy, right?

1061
01:40:41,269 --> 01:40:44,063
It was that Chase, wasn't it?

1062
01:40:46,608 --> 01:40:48,026
Kya, look at me.

1063
01:40:51,029 --> 01:40:52,947
Now you tell me what he did.

1064
01:40:55,241 --> 01:40:56,492
I can't say it.

1065
01:40:58,119 --> 01:40:59,203
It's over now.

1066
01:40:59,996 --> 01:41:01,789
I just want it out of my life.

1067
01:41:01,873 --> 01:41:04,125
And how you know
he ain't coming after you again?

1068
01:41:05,418 --> 01:41:08,129
- You're all by your lonesome out there.
- Jumpin', please.

1069
01:41:09,422 --> 01:41:11,215
You can't tell anybody.

1070
01:41:11,841 --> 01:41:13,051
You know how it is.

1071
01:41:13,134 --> 01:41:18,348
They'd drag me into the sheriff's office
and make me describe it to a bunch of men.

1072
01:41:19,599 --> 01:41:23,019
And then write me up in the papers,
accusing me of whoring.

1073
01:41:24,103 --> 01:41:26,189
Or trying to get money out of his parents.

1074
01:41:27,065 --> 01:41:28,733
Okay? They'd do nothing about it.

1075
01:41:28,816 --> 01:41:29,859
You're right, Kya.

1076
01:41:32,445 --> 01:41:34,906
And I ain't gonna do anything
to make this thing worse.

1077
01:41:37,158 --> 01:41:40,411
But you let me know
when you're coming and going.

1078
01:41:40,495 --> 01:41:41,537
You hear?

1079
01:41:42,372 --> 01:41:44,248
I gotta know if you're out of town.

1080
01:41:47,669 --> 01:41:50,838
'Cause if I don't see you for a while...

1081
01:41:56,219 --> 01:41:57,553
Thank you, Jumpin'.

1082
01:41:58,638 --> 01:42:00,306
I'm leaving in a few days.

1083
01:42:02,016 --> 01:42:03,643
I'll come see you as soon as I'm back.

1084
01:42:05,978 --> 01:42:07,063
Okay, that's good.

1085
01:42:08,022 --> 01:42:09,023
That's good.

1086
01:42:12,944 --> 01:42:17,240
Miss Price, would you tell us
what you saw on the morning of October 29?

1087
01:42:17,323 --> 01:42:19,283
I saw the Marsh Girl...

1088
01:42:19,367 --> 01:42:21,035
Miss Clark, that is. Pardon me.

1089
01:42:21,119 --> 01:42:24,163
- Get on the 9:00 bus.
- You've got quite a good memory.

1090
01:42:24,247 --> 01:42:25,289
We all talked about it.

1091
01:42:25,373 --> 01:42:27,834
We'd never seen her
all cleaned up like that.

1092
01:42:27,917 --> 01:42:29,252
Hair combed, makeup.

1093
01:42:30,086 --> 01:42:34,424
Just to be clear,
on the morning of October 29,

1094
01:42:34,507 --> 01:42:39,303
you and several others saw
Miss Clark board the 9 a.m. bus

1095
01:42:39,387 --> 01:42:41,222
and leave Barkley Cove.

1096
01:42:41,305 --> 01:42:43,266
- Yes, that's right.
- Thank you, Miss Price.

1097
01:42:43,349 --> 01:42:44,976
No further questions, Your Honor.

1098
01:42:45,059 --> 01:42:49,564
Miss Price, is the Piggly Wiggly open
at 1:30 in the morning?

1099
01:42:50,189 --> 01:42:51,357
No, sir.

1100
01:42:52,442 --> 01:42:54,068
Well, the reason I ask is,

1101
01:42:54,652 --> 01:42:57,822
you couldn't have seen who got off
the night bus from Greenville,

1102
01:42:58,364 --> 01:43:01,075
nor could you have seen
who got on the 2:30 a.m. bus

1103
01:43:01,159 --> 01:43:04,704
from Barkley Cove
back to Greenville, could you?

1104
01:43:04,787 --> 01:43:06,456
Well, no. Of course not.

1105
01:43:06,539 --> 01:43:11,377
So after you saw Miss Clark board
that morning bus to Greenville...

1106
01:43:13,129 --> 01:43:15,923
she could have returned
to Barkley Cove that night

1107
01:43:16,007 --> 01:43:19,927
and been back in Greenville for breakfast,
all without you taking notice.

1108
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:22,221
My name is Robert Foster.

1109
01:43:22,305 --> 01:43:25,516
I'm a senior editor
at Harrison Morris Publishing Company

1110
01:43:25,600 --> 01:43:26,684
in Boston, Massachusetts.

1111
01:43:26,768 --> 01:43:31,063
Mr. Foster, you sat down
for dinner with Miss Clark at 7 p.m.

1112
01:43:31,147 --> 01:43:33,191
on the night of October 29.

1113
01:43:33,274 --> 01:43:34,525
- Correct?
- Yes.

1114
01:43:34,609 --> 01:43:36,652
What was your first impression of her?

1115
01:43:38,154 --> 01:43:43,785
My first impression was, uh, that she was
very shy, very gentle, very smart.

1116
01:43:44,744 --> 01:43:46,537
I knew that she was something
of a recluse,

1117
01:43:46,621 --> 01:43:49,499
but I also knew
that she was a gifted naturalist.

1118
01:43:49,582 --> 01:43:52,543
- How long did that dinner go on?
- At least a few hours.

1119
01:43:52,627 --> 01:43:54,337
Some female insects do eat
their mates.

1120
01:43:54,420 --> 01:43:57,215
Fireflies, in fact,
have two different light signals.

1121
01:43:57,715 --> 01:43:58,841
One for mating,

1122
01:43:58,925 --> 01:44:01,928
and one to attract a male
in order to make him her next meal.

1123
01:44:02,011 --> 01:44:03,763
- So she eats him?
- How gruesome.

1124
01:44:03,846 --> 01:44:06,516
- Oh, dear.
- I must spend less time with insects.

1125
01:44:06,599 --> 01:44:08,935
- It's quite amoral.
- Amoral, indeed.

1126
01:44:09,018 --> 01:44:11,354
I don't know
if there is a dark side to nature.

1127
01:44:13,105 --> 01:44:14,899
Just inventive ways to endure.

1128
01:44:16,192 --> 01:44:17,276
Against all odds.

1129
01:44:17,360 --> 01:44:21,948
And when you met with Miss Clark
the following morning, October 30th,

1130
01:44:22,031 --> 01:44:25,993
was there anything unusual
about her appearance or her demeanor?

1131
01:44:26,077 --> 01:44:27,245
Not at all.

1132
01:44:27,870 --> 01:44:29,539
No further questions, Your Honor.

1133
01:44:29,622 --> 01:44:32,124
Mr. Foster, did Miss Clark stay

1134
01:44:32,208 --> 01:44:34,794
at the same hotel
as you and your colleagues?

1135
01:44:34,877 --> 01:44:37,505
No. She preferred a smaller hotel.

1136
01:44:37,588 --> 01:44:40,132
The, uh, Mountain something.

1137
01:44:40,216 --> 01:44:43,469
Could you look at this map
of Greenville for me, please?

1138
01:44:43,553 --> 01:44:48,140
I think you'll see The Piedmont,
where you and your colleagues stayed,

1139
01:44:48,224 --> 01:44:52,228
and then The Three Mountains Hotel,
where Miss Clark stayed.

1140
01:44:52,311 --> 01:44:55,815
Could you tell me
which one is closest to the bus station?

1141
01:44:57,483 --> 01:44:59,902
The Three Mountains Hotel is closer.

1142
01:44:59,986 --> 01:45:03,614
In fact, The Three Mountains is
the closest hotel

1143
01:45:03,698 --> 01:45:05,908
to the Greenville bus station.
Is that correct?

1144
01:45:07,201 --> 01:45:08,327
Looks that way.

1145
01:45:09,203 --> 01:45:10,830
No further questions.

1146
01:45:10,913 --> 01:45:14,417
I don't think a good lawyer ever puts
their client on the stand,

1147
01:45:14,500 --> 01:45:16,085
but this might help you.

1148
01:45:16,794 --> 01:45:21,090
For the jury to be able
to hear from you, directly.

1149
01:45:22,341 --> 01:45:25,428
For them to be able to see you...

1150
01:45:26,804 --> 01:45:29,390
as the kind
and thoughtful person you truly are.

1151
01:45:29,473 --> 01:45:31,100
They're never gonna see me like that.

1152
01:45:31,183 --> 01:45:34,604
Listen. I know you have a world
of reasons to hate these people...

1153
01:45:34,687 --> 01:45:36,105
No, I never hated them.

1154
01:45:36,188 --> 01:45:37,690
They hated me.

1155
01:45:39,025 --> 01:45:42,194
They laughed at me. They left me.

1156
01:45:42,778 --> 01:45:45,156
They harassed me. They attacked me.

1157
01:45:45,239 --> 01:45:48,117
You... You want me to beg for my life?

1158
01:45:49,285 --> 01:45:50,494
I don't have it in me.

1159
01:45:51,120 --> 01:45:52,121
I won't.

1160
01:45:53,956 --> 01:45:56,542
I will not offer myself up.

1161
01:45:56,626 --> 01:45:58,085
They can make their decision.

1162
01:46:00,630 --> 01:46:04,300
But they're not deciding
anything about me.

1163
01:46:06,302 --> 01:46:07,303
It's them.

1164
01:46:09,221 --> 01:46:10,681
They're judging themselves.

1165
01:46:13,434 --> 01:46:14,560
All right, then.

1166
01:46:21,943 --> 01:46:25,112
Mr. Milton,
you have always been kind to me.

1167
01:46:26,614 --> 01:46:27,865
Even as a child.

1168
01:46:29,659 --> 01:46:30,868
I never forgot.

1169
01:46:41,045 --> 01:46:44,757
His life was cut short
by the jilted lover

1170
01:46:44,840 --> 01:46:48,052
who could not accept
that he had returned to the fold.

1171
01:46:48,594 --> 01:46:53,057
A witness saw Miss Clark
and Chase in the marsh.

1172
01:46:53,140 --> 01:46:55,893
Heard her say the words "I'll kill you."

1173
01:46:56,477 --> 01:46:57,812
And what's more,

1174
01:46:57,895 --> 01:47:02,191
is there's physical evidence
from that night connecting them.

1175
01:47:02,900 --> 01:47:05,861
Fibers from her red wool cap

1176
01:47:06,362 --> 01:47:08,239
left on his denim jacket.

1177
01:47:08,322 --> 01:47:09,865
Dad, I'm going over to deal with it.

1178
01:47:09,949 --> 01:47:12,910
Who else would have motive
to take that shell necklace?

1179
01:47:14,912 --> 01:47:17,415
You can, and you must,

1180
01:47:17,498 --> 01:47:22,086
find that the defendant is guilty
of first-degree murder.

1181
01:47:31,887 --> 01:47:33,014
Mr. Milton.

1182
01:47:48,779 --> 01:47:52,992
I have lived in Barkley Cove
my whole life.

1183
01:47:54,160 --> 01:47:58,164
And like you, I heard the tall tales

1184
01:47:58,247 --> 01:48:00,166
told about the Marsh Girl.

1185
01:48:00,708 --> 01:48:03,002
That she was part wolf.

1186
01:48:03,085 --> 01:48:06,756
A missing link between ape and man.

1187
01:48:07,256 --> 01:48:09,717
That her eyes glowed in the dark.

1188
01:48:11,469 --> 01:48:14,180
Well, here she is.

1189
01:48:15,056 --> 01:48:18,976
The reality is that she was
an abandoned child.

1190
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:23,564
A little girl surviving out there
in the marsh on her own,

1191
01:48:23,647 --> 01:48:26,275
reviled and shunned.

1192
01:48:29,236 --> 01:48:32,656
Mr. James Madison and his wife, Mabel,

1193
01:48:32,740 --> 01:48:34,992
they are sitting here
in the courtroom today.

1194
01:48:35,076 --> 01:48:38,996
They're about the only people
in this town who showed her any care.

1195
01:48:39,080 --> 01:48:40,456
The rest of us...

1196
01:48:42,917 --> 01:48:44,794
Well, I'm ashamed to say

1197
01:48:45,961 --> 01:48:51,550
that we labeled her and rejected her
because we thought she was different.

1198
01:48:52,259 --> 01:48:53,552
And now...

1199
01:48:55,471 --> 01:48:59,225
the job of judging this shy
and rejected young woman

1200
01:48:59,308 --> 01:49:01,894
has fallen on your shoulders.

1201
01:49:01,977 --> 01:49:07,399
But you must base your judgment
on the facts presented in this courtroom,

1202
01:49:07,483 --> 01:49:13,572
and not on the rumors and feelings
from the past 25 years.

1203
01:49:13,656 --> 01:49:16,575
Miss Clark has a solid alibi.

1204
01:49:16,659 --> 01:49:19,995
She was in Greenville
the night Chase Andrews died.

1205
01:49:20,079 --> 01:49:24,917
And what facts, exactly,
stand against her?

1206
01:49:26,752 --> 01:49:31,715
The State has not proven
that this incident was indeed a murder,

1207
01:49:31,799 --> 01:49:34,885
and not just some tragic accident.

1208
01:49:35,928 --> 01:49:39,598
The State wants you to believe
that at 11:30 at night,

1209
01:49:39,682 --> 01:49:42,226
without a single witness seeing her,

1210
01:49:42,309 --> 01:49:45,688
she caught the last bus
from Greenville to Barkley Cove,

1211
01:49:45,771 --> 01:49:48,399
and rode that bus disguised,

1212
01:49:48,482 --> 01:49:51,819
since neither of the bus drivers
that night could identify her

1213
01:49:51,902 --> 01:49:55,030
as a passenger,
all the way back to Barkley Cove.

1214
01:49:55,114 --> 01:49:58,868
And then, in less than an hour...

1215
01:50:00,578 --> 01:50:03,414
she tracks down Chase Andrews
in the middle of the night,

1216
01:50:03,497 --> 01:50:06,000
lures him to the tower, murders him,

1217
01:50:06,083 --> 01:50:08,169
wipes away all physical evidence,

1218
01:50:08,252 --> 01:50:13,132
and somehow catches
the 2:30 a.m. bus back to Greenville.

1219
01:50:13,215 --> 01:50:15,718
Again,
without a single witness seeing her.

1220
01:50:15,801 --> 01:50:18,721
And after doing all that,

1221
01:50:19,972 --> 01:50:23,434
she meets with her publishers
the next morning, unruffled.

1222
01:50:23,517 --> 01:50:25,436
Now, these are not facts.

1223
01:50:26,353 --> 01:50:29,190
These are just more of the rumors

1224
01:50:29,273 --> 01:50:34,653
and tall tales that we have been spreading
about Miss Clark her entire life.

1225
01:50:35,487 --> 01:50:39,450
I believe you will come
to a judgment based on the facts,

1226
01:50:39,533 --> 01:50:42,912
and not the gossip
that you have heard for years.

1227
01:50:43,954 --> 01:50:46,248
It's time, at last,

1228
01:50:47,333 --> 01:50:51,420
for all of us to be fair
to the Marsh Girl.

1229
01:50:53,631 --> 01:50:55,883
Maybe you should go home
and do your waiting there.

1230
01:50:55,966 --> 01:50:58,552
Six hours already.
How long do you think they'll take?

1231
01:50:58,636 --> 01:51:01,013
Well, let's hope
they take a good long while.

1232
01:51:01,096 --> 01:51:04,975
If a few jurors have doubts,
we got a chance.

1233
01:51:19,698 --> 01:51:23,077
Mr. Foreman, is it correct
that the jury has reached a verdict?

1234
01:51:23,577 --> 01:51:24,787
We have, Your Honor.

1235
01:51:39,009 --> 01:51:42,930
The defendant will please rise
for the reading of the verdict.

1236
01:51:48,018 --> 01:51:49,019
Stand up.

1237
01:51:58,988 --> 01:52:03,325
"We, the jury, find the defendant,
Catherine Danielle Clark...

1238
01:52:04,618 --> 01:52:09,999
not guilty of first-degree murder
of Mr. Chase Andrews."

1239
01:52:16,297 --> 01:52:18,674
Miss Clark, you are free to go.

1240
01:52:18,757 --> 01:52:22,678
And I apologize, on behalf of the State,
for the time that you have served.

1241
01:52:22,761 --> 01:52:24,513
This court is dismissed.

1242
01:52:28,767 --> 01:52:29,768
Thank you.

1243
01:52:35,899 --> 01:52:36,900
Come here.

1244
01:52:39,445 --> 01:52:42,072
You're okay. You're all right.

1245
01:52:43,782 --> 01:52:47,119
You just forget about this nonsense.
We're looking forward to the next book.

1246
01:53:02,426 --> 01:53:03,761
Can you take me home?

1247
01:53:52,142 --> 01:53:54,103
Now I can finally admit.

1248
01:53:55,229 --> 01:53:59,608
All the months in isolation,
yearning to be back in the marsh,

1249
01:54:00,275 --> 01:54:03,112
it was knowing
how much was left to explore,

1250
01:54:04,071 --> 01:54:06,532
how much life to uncover in the wild,

1251
01:54:06,615 --> 01:54:07,783
that kept me going.

1252
01:54:10,035 --> 01:54:11,286
And the hope,

1253
01:54:12,121 --> 01:54:13,497
always that hope...

1254
01:54:15,082 --> 01:54:17,042
that one day I could share it...

1255
01:54:19,420 --> 01:54:22,256
with the only person
I had ever truly loved.

1256
01:54:52,911 --> 01:54:53,996
Kya!

1257
01:54:55,539 --> 01:54:56,539
Kya.

1258
01:55:12,347 --> 01:55:13,347
Hey.

1259
01:55:14,057 --> 01:55:15,434
You know I love you, right?

1260
01:56:20,123 --> 01:56:21,123
What?

1261
01:56:21,833 --> 01:56:24,670
Will you, uh...? Sorry. I'm sorry.

1262
01:56:27,464 --> 01:56:28,632
Will you marry me?

1263
01:56:30,300 --> 01:56:31,552
I mean, do you want to?

1264
01:56:35,264 --> 01:56:36,682
Well, aren't we already?

1265
01:56:38,433 --> 01:56:39,434
Like geese?

1266
01:56:42,563 --> 01:56:44,231
I can live with that, I guess.

1267
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:47,901
Come here.

1268
01:57:00,038 --> 01:57:02,040
Oh, here we go.

1269
01:57:02,124 --> 01:57:03,041
Hey.

1270
01:57:03,125 --> 01:57:05,168
Hey, you. Hi, there.

1271
01:57:11,216 --> 01:57:12,843
Come here, baby girl.

1272
01:57:14,845 --> 01:57:16,888
He loved you so much.

1273
01:57:27,357 --> 01:57:29,276
Kya. Look at that.

1274
01:57:29,359 --> 01:57:31,945
You see that up there?
On the elbow of that branch?

1275
01:57:33,989 --> 01:57:36,199
When's the last time we saw one of those?

1276
01:57:37,284 --> 01:57:38,285
I know.

1277
01:57:42,748 --> 01:57:45,792
This book's pretty good.
This guy's still talking about...

1278
01:57:59,890 --> 01:58:01,850
I hope when it is time
for me to leave,

1279
01:58:01,933 --> 01:58:05,103
I will go quick and easy,
without making too much noise.

1280
01:58:26,041 --> 01:58:27,042
Ma!

1281
01:58:27,751 --> 01:58:28,752
Ma.

1282
01:58:33,882 --> 01:58:34,882
Ma.

1283
01:58:36,677 --> 01:58:37,677
Kya?

1284
01:58:38,345 --> 01:58:39,346
Kya!

1285
01:59:17,426 --> 01:59:19,136
It has always been enough...

1286
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:22,848
to be part of the natural sequence
of things.

1287
01:59:24,266 --> 01:59:25,559
Sure as the tides.

1288
01:59:26,393 --> 01:59:27,769
Nature my guide.

1289
01:59:32,399 --> 01:59:34,443
The marsh knows all about death...

1290
01:59:37,446 --> 01:59:40,073
and doesn't necessarily
define it as tragedy.

1291
01:59:41,241 --> 01:59:42,659
Certainly not a sin.

1292
01:59:44,411 --> 01:59:48,457
It understands that every creature
does what it must to survive.

1293
01:59:51,126 --> 01:59:54,296
And that sometimes, for prey to live...

1294
01:59:55,505 --> 01:59:57,257
its predator must die.

1295
02:00:25,535 --> 02:00:26,870
I am the marsh now.

1296
02:00:28,955 --> 02:00:30,540
I am the feather of an egret.

1297
02:00:31,833 --> 02:00:34,336
I am every shell washed upon the shore.

1298
02:00:38,131 --> 02:00:39,508
I am a firefly.

1299
02:00:40,550 --> 02:00:44,012
You'll see hundreds beckoning far
into the dark reaches of the marsh.

1300
02:00:45,138 --> 02:00:47,182
And that's where you will always find me.

1301
02:00:48,391 --> 02:00:49,643
Way out yonder.

1302
02:00:50,352 --> 02:00:51,812
Where the crawdads sing.
