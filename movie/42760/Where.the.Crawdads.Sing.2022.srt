1
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,572
沼泽不是沼泽。
Marsh is not swamp.

2
00:01:13,574 --> 00:01:15,660
沼泽是一片光明的空间……
Marsh is a space of light...

3
00:01:18,621 --> 00:01:23,793
青草在水中生长……水流入天空。
where grass grows in water... and water flows into the sky.

4
00:02:08,045 --> 00:02:10,715
然后在沼泽里，这里和那里……
Then within the marsh, here and there...

5
00:02:13,092 --> 00:02:14,302
真正的沼泽。
true swamp.

6
00:02:54,550 --> 00:03:00,348
沼泽知道死亡的一切…也不一定把它定义为悲剧。
A swamp knows all about death... and doesn't necessarily define it as tragedy.

7
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,808
当然也不是罪过。
Certainly not a sin.

8
00:03:05,478 --> 00:03:08,147
我以为蔡斯·安德鲁斯会更有常识。
I thought Chase Andrews would have more common sense.

9
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:11,067
镇上有史以来最好的四分卫。
Best quarterback this town ever had.

10
00:03:14,737 --> 00:03:17,490
孩子们，这是你们的脚印吗?
Boys, are these your footprints here?

11
00:03:17,573 --> 00:03:18,574
是的,先生。
Yes, sir.

12
00:03:25,706 --> 00:03:27,124
他的足迹在哪里?
Where's his footprints?

13
00:03:34,757 --> 00:03:40,805
是啊，有些孩子脑子里会有一些疯狂的想法然后喝酒，以为自己是无敌的。
Yeah, some kids just get crazy ideas in their heads and drink and think they're invincible.

14
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,766
那个蔡斯·安德鲁斯不是基德。
That Chase Andrews was no Kid.

15
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,864
嘿。看看这个。
Hey. Look at this.

16
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:11,669
-他自己打开的?-也有可能是意外
- He open the grate himself? - Could've been an accident, all the same.

17
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,506
死亡时间午夜到凌晨两点之间
Time of death, between midnight and 2 a.m.

18
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,510
死亡原因，从63英尺高的地方突然撞击。
Cause of death, sudden impact from the 63-foot drop.

19
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:27,601
既然你在支撑梁上发现了血迹和毛发，我就推断这是造成主要伤害的原因。
Since you found that blood and hair on the support beam, I would deduce that was the cause of the primary injury.

20
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:32,648
用外行的话来说，他摔下去的时候撞到了后脑勺。
Laymen's terms, he banged the back of his head on the way down.

21
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:36,861
要让后脑勺撞到横梁上，他得向后倒，对吗?
To hit the back of his head on the beam, he would've needed to fall backwards, is that right?

22
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,072
-我想是的。-所以他可能是被推的
- I'd say yes. - So he might have been pushed.

23
00:04:40,156 --> 00:04:42,908
栏杆上没有指纹，栅栏上也没有，什么都没有。
There's no fingerprints on the railing, the grates, nothing.

24
00:04:42,992 --> 00:04:46,036
没有指纹?也不是从蔡斯来的?
No fingerprints? Not from Chase either?

25
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,790
没有指纹，没有痕迹。
No fingerprints, no tracks.

26
00:04:49,874 --> 00:04:54,086
我们在夹克上找到了红色纤维。
We do have those red fibers found on the jacket.

27
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:57,548
我刚从亚特兰大拿到化验报告。
I just got the lab report back from Atlanta.

28
00:04:58,048 --> 00:05:01,385
这不是他其他衣服上穿的。
They did not come from any of his other clothing.

29
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:05,931
羊毛,它说。可以是毛衣，围巾。
Wool, it says. That could be a sweater, scarf.

30
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:07,641
见鬼，什么都有可能。
Hell, it could be anything.

31
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,185
我们必须找到它。
And we gotta find it.

32
00:05:09,268 --> 00:05:13,272
美丽的妻子，美满的家庭。想不出有谁会想杀奇斯。
A beautiful wife, good family. Can't think of anyone who'd want to kill Chase.

33
00:05:13,355 --> 00:05:15,149
来吧。你知道蔡斯的为人。
Come on. You know how Chase was.

34
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,902
像被关起来的公牛一样到处发情。
Tomcattin', ruttin' around like a penned-up bull let out.

35
00:05:17,985 --> 00:05:19,695
别说死人的坏话，弗兰克。
Don't speak ill of the dead, Frank.

36
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:22,948
我只是说我能想出几个人来做。
I'm just saying I could think of a few guys up to it.

37
00:05:23,032 --> 00:05:24,909
——弥尔顿先生。——你好,桑迪。
- Mr. Milton. - Hi, Sandy.

38
00:05:24,992 --> 00:05:27,119
——通常?不伦瑞克炖?-你怎么猜到的。
- The usual? Brunswick stew? - How'd you guess.

39
00:05:28,454 --> 00:05:31,040
你对蔡斯·安德鲁斯的案子怎么看，汤姆?
What do you make of the Chase Andrews case, Tom?

40
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:34,084
哦,我退休了。这已经不关我的事了。
Oh, I'm retired. That's none of my business anymore.

41
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:36,795
- - - - - -很好。-可能是沼泽里的那个女人
- Fair enough. - Could've been that woman in the marsh.

42
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:40,174
她已经疯到要进疯人院了。我打赌她一定在策划这样的事。
She's crazy enough for the loony bin. I bet she'd be up to something like this.

43
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,843
我哥哥告诉我《沼泽女孩》是缺失的一环。
My brother's told me that Marsh Girl's the missing link.

44
00:05:42,927 --> 00:05:45,846
你知道可怜的蔡斯·安德鲁斯在沼泽里有事。
You know poor Chase Andrews had something going on down in that marsh.

45
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:49,308
Chase Andrews和Marsh Girl?如果这不是自找麻烦的话。
Chase Andrews and the Marsh Girl? Now if that ain't asking for trouble.

46
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,021
你觉得到底发生了什么，弗兰克?
What do you think really happened, Frank?

47
00:05:54,104 --> 00:05:55,940
你觉得是那个女孩杀了蔡斯?
You think that Marsh Girl killed Chase?

48
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:58,442
见鬼，我不知道。真相终将大白。
Hell, I don't know. Truth will come out.

49
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:25,844
看看这些羽毛什么的。
Look at all these feathers and whatnot.

50
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:30,808
她是科学家还是女巫?
She a scientist or a witch?

51
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,271
克拉克小姐吗?
Miss Clark?

52
00:06:39,108 --> 00:06:41,110
治安部门。——警长。
- Sheriff's Department. - Sheriff.

53
00:06:42,987 --> 00:06:43,987
看。
Look.

54
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,948
可以申请搜查令。
Could get a warrant.

55
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,118
普通视图。可能的原因,警长。
Plain view. Probable cause, sheriff.

56
00:06:51,662 --> 00:06:53,581
我打赌门都没锁。
Bet that door isn't even locked.

57
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:45,382
她就在那儿。
There she is.

58
00:07:47,051 --> 00:07:50,471
这里是治安部门。关掉引擎。
This is the Sheriff's Department. Shut down your engine.

59
00:07:58,771 --> 00:08:01,607
直走，直走。跟着她!
Go straight, go straight. Follow her in!

60
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:43,190
——你有罪!-你杀了蔡斯·安德鲁斯!
- You're guilty! - You killed Chase Andrews!

61
00:08:43,273 --> 00:08:45,609
-你会为此付出代价的!-烂在监狱里!
- You'll pay for this! - Rot in jail!

62
00:09:03,085 --> 00:09:06,338
周日正义。你去哪了，凯蒂?
Sunday Justice. Where you gone, kitty?

63
00:09:07,464 --> 00:09:09,007
请留下来。
Please stay.

64
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:10,634
在这里,凯蒂,凯蒂。
Here, kitty, kitty.

65
00:09:27,609 --> 00:09:28,861
克拉克小姐吗?
Miss Clark?

66
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:32,573
我是汤姆·弥尔顿。
I'm Tom Milton.

67
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:36,118
我是一个律师。我可以进来吗?
I'm a lawyer. May I come in?

68
00:09:41,248 --> 00:09:42,750
谢谢你，弗雷泽先生。
Thank you, Mr. Frazier.

69
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:48,046
你可能知道你因谋杀蔡斯·安德鲁斯而被拘留。
You probably know that you're being held for the murder of Chase Andrews.

70
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,509
我冒昧地站出来为你辩护。
And I have taken the liberty of putting myself forward to defend you.

71
00:09:52,593 --> 00:10:00,392
我知道你以前从没惹过麻烦，所以我可以解释一下法庭和审判以及谁是谁，诸如此类的事。
I know you've never been in trouble before, so I can explain the courtroom and the trial and who is who and whatnot.

72
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:07,316
你有家人想和你一起去吗?
Uh, do you have family that you might want to come be with you?

73
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:29,588
克拉克小姐，我不知道该怎么说，但是…我知道你叫凯瑟琳·丹妮尔·克拉克，但在巴克利湾他们不叫你这个名字。
Miss Clark, I don't quite know how to put this, but, uh... Well, I know you as Catherine Danielle Clark, but here in Barkley Cove they don't call you by that name.

74
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,298
他们叫你沼泽女孩。
They call you Marsh Girl.

75
00:10:32,424 --> 00:10:41,183
当你受审时，陪审团会对你进行审判他们都是来自巴克利湾的同行，他们只知道你的真实身份。
And when you stand trial, you will be judged by a jury of your peers from Barkley Cove, who only know you as such.

76
00:10:41,266 --> 00:10:45,395
不管他们是否认识你，他们都会评价你。
They are going to judge you whether they know you or not.

77
00:10:47,231 --> 00:10:52,694
但我不能帮你，除非我了解你。
But I can't help you unless I know you.

78
00:10:52,778 --> 00:10:54,988
哪怕只有一点点。
Even just a little bit.

79
00:10:59,034 --> 00:11:06,083
好吧，那好吧。嗯…我过一会儿再来，等你有时间考虑一下。
Well, all right, then. Um... I'll come back in a while when you've had time to consider.

80
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:12,589
对了，我给你带来了这个。
Oh, and I brought you this just in the meantime.

81
00:11:20,013 --> 00:11:21,348
弗雷泽先生。
Mr. Frazier.

82
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:29,189
人们忘记了那些生活在贝壳里的生物。
People forget about the creatures who live in shells.

83
00:11:32,568 --> 00:11:34,027
我曾经有过家庭。
I had a family once.

84
00:11:36,488 --> 00:11:38,031
他们叫我Kya。
They called me Kya.

85
00:11:44,788 --> 00:11:45,831
Kya !
Kya!

86
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:48,876
Kya !你最好别走得太远。
Kya! You'd better not get too far out.

87
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:51,669
抓住它，抓住它!
Get it, get it!

88
00:12:08,687 --> 00:12:12,232
现在这只小猪去市场了。现在你别动。
Now this little piggy went to market. Now you hold still.

89
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:15,861
这只小猪呆在家里。
This little piggy stayed home.

90
00:12:16,653 --> 00:12:18,989
这只小猪吃了烤牛肉。
This little piggy ate roast beef.

91
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:22,034
这只小猪什么都没有。
This little piggy had none.

92
00:12:22,117 --> 00:12:28,165
这只小猪在回家的路上一路咯吱咯吱。
And this little piggy went wee-wee-wee-wee all the way home.

93
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:34,004
那是我特别的女孩。
That's my special girl.

94
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,635
嘿,朱迪!
Hey, Jodie!

95
00:12:41,553 --> 00:12:42,971
嘿,泰特!
Hey, Tate!

96
00:12:43,055 --> 00:12:45,098
想要来钓鱼吗?
Wanna come fishing?

97
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,770
-我没有太多的时间。- "Ain't"不是一个真实的词。
- I ain't got too much time. - "Ain't" isn't a real word.

98
00:12:51,813 --> 00:12:55,692
嘿，我跟你说过多少次了别弄脏我的船!
Hey, how many times I told you not to mess in my goddamn boat?!

99
00:12:57,653 --> 00:12:59,821
进屋去!你是愚蠢的吗? !
Get in the house! Are you stupid?!

100
00:13:02,574 --> 00:13:05,327
来这里!现在你做到了。
Come here! Now you've done it.

101
00:13:06,495 --> 00:13:08,705
你要学会尊重。你听到我吗?
You gotta learn respect. You hear me?

102
00:13:10,248 --> 00:13:13,001
——停止它!你伤害她!-嘿，离我爸爸远点!
- Stop it! You're hurting her! - Hey, you leave my pa alone!

103
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,337
回到我的土地上，我会杀了你!你听到我吗? !
Come back on my land, I'll shoot you! You hear me?!

104
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,547
-冷静点。- - - - - -闭嘴!
- Calm down now. - Shut up!

105
00:13:19,216 --> 00:13:20,216
闭嘴!
Shut up!

106
00:13:24,096 --> 00:13:25,681
-离我远点!-我指给你看!
- Leave me alone! - I'll show you!

107
00:13:25,764 --> 00:13:27,140
请停下来!
Please just stop!

108
00:14:06,096 --> 00:14:07,597
马!
Ma!

109
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,850
马?
Ma?

110
00:14:20,944 --> 00:14:22,112
妈妈再也没有回来。
Ma never came back.

111
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,992
其他人也都很快地以同样的方式离开了。
And everybody else was quick to get out the same way.

112
00:14:27,868 --> 00:14:29,745
墨菲第一个离开了。
Murph was the first to leave.

113
00:14:31,538 --> 00:14:34,499
几个月后，曼迪和米西。
A few months later, Mandy and Missy.

114
00:14:37,711 --> 00:14:40,505
最后,朱迪。
Then, finally, Jodie.

115
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,256
Kya。
Kya.

116
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:44,885
Kya,听着。
Kya, listen.

117
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,264
我得走了，Kya。我不能再住在这里了。
I have to go, Kya. I can't live here no longer.

118
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,561
Kya，你要小心，听到了吗?
Kya, you be careful, hear?

119
00:14:54,644 --> 00:14:59,357
如果你遇到麻烦，跑到沼泽深处，躲到小龙虾唱歌的地方。
If you're in trouble, run and hide deep in the marsh way out where the crawdads sing.

120
00:15:01,151 --> 00:15:02,569
就像马云经常说的。
Like Ma always says.

121
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:22,714
快跑!
Run!

122
00:15:24,341 --> 00:15:25,342
朱迪!
Jodie!

123
00:15:26,802 --> 00:15:29,805
我从别人的错误中学到了如何和他一起生活。
I learned from the mistakes of the others how to live with him.

124
00:15:33,016 --> 00:15:35,227
别碍事就行。
Just keep out of the way.

125
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:36,686
别让他看到你。
Don't let him see you.

126
00:15:37,646 --> 00:15:38,939
照顾好自己。
Fend for yourself.

127
00:16:31,366 --> 00:16:35,620
我和朱迪到沼泽里去过很多次，但从来没有一个人。
I had been out in the marsh plenty of times with Jodie, but never alone.

128
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:38,790
我不知道哪条路是家。
I didn't know which way was home.

129
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,127
该死的，你把我丢在这里，朱迪!
Damn you for leaving me here, Jodie!

130
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,547
去你的
Damn you.

131
00:16:55,891 --> 00:16:57,350
你没事吧?
You okay?

132
00:17:00,103 --> 00:17:01,730
你是朱迪·克拉克的妹妹。
You're Jodie Clark's sister.

133
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,524
曾经是。他走了。
Used to be. He's gone.

134
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,946
你知道回家的路吗?-是的。
- You know your way home? - Yeah.

135
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,040
没关系。我总是迷路。
It's okay. I get lost all the time.

136
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:32,135
我叫泰特，以防你再见到我。
My name's Tate, in case you see me again.

137
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:33,678
泰特。
Tate.

138
00:17:35,013 --> 00:17:38,934
那个男孩身上有某种东西让我的胸口放松下来。
There was something about that boy that eased the tightness in my chest.

139
00:17:40,185 --> 00:17:44,606
自从妈妈和乔迪离开后，我第一次感觉到除了受伤之外的感觉。
For the first time since Ma and Jodie left, I felt something other than hurt.

140
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:48,693
我觉得自己很勇敢
I felt brave.

141
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:52,072
我饿了。
I'm hungry.

142
00:18:05,877 --> 00:18:08,922
早上好,克拉克先生。你过得如何?
Morning, Mr. Clark. How you doing?

143
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:13,051
好吧，跳起来，我在土的右边醒来。
Well, Jumpin', I woke up on the right side of dirt.

144
00:18:14,719 --> 00:18:18,390
这是我女儿，凯拉·克拉克小姐。
Oh, this is my daughter, Miss Kya Clark.

145
00:18:18,473 --> 00:18:20,809
认识你我很骄傲，Kya小姐。
Well, I'm mighty proud to know you, Miss Kya.

146
00:18:21,726 --> 00:18:25,021
哦，别理她。我告诉她，离所有人都远点。
Oh, don't mind her. I tell her, uh, stay away from everybody.

147
00:18:25,105 --> 00:18:28,692
-这是一个危险的世界，不是吗?——这是。但是钓鱼很好。
- It's a dangerous world, isn't it? - It is. But the fishing's good.

148
00:18:28,775 --> 00:18:30,860
能给我一袋玉米粉吗?
Could I get a bag of grits?

149
00:18:30,944 --> 00:18:33,405
还有那个吉姆·比姆?
And some of that Jim Beam?

150
00:18:34,030 --> 00:18:36,449
-也许你能帮我加满?——没关系。
- And maybe you fill her up for me? - It's okay.

151
00:18:37,575 --> 00:18:39,244
——梅布尔。-嗯嗯。
- Mabel. - Mm-hm.

152
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,791
等我们找钱，听到了吗?
You wait for our change, you hear?

153
00:18:47,794 --> 00:18:50,130
你妈不在的时候帮你爸，是吗?
Helping out your pa while your ma's gone, huh?

154
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,966
我有段时间没见她了。
I ain't seen her in a while.

155
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,928
她正在家里做家务。Mm-him。
She's doing chores at home. Mm-him.

156
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,559
砂砾没什么可查的。
Grits ain't much to go on.

157
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,147
好吧。让我们看看这里。
All right. Let's see here.

158
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,733
你爸在这里留了2美元。
Your pa left $2 here.

159
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:15,030
账单是1.5美元。
And the bill is $1.50.

160
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:17,282
汽油还剩多少钱?
How much does that leave for gas?

161
00:19:23,872 --> 00:19:25,081
别担心。
Don't worry about that.

162
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,042
我还有一个问题要问你。
I got another question for you.

163
00:19:27,751 --> 00:19:28,918
你上学了吗，亲爱的?
You go to school, honey?

164
00:19:31,796 --> 00:19:34,591
你知道他们在报纸上刊登学校午餐菜单吗?
Do you know that they publish the school lunch menu in the paper?

165
00:19:35,342 --> 00:19:39,888
今天的是……索尔斯伯利牛肉饼。
Today's is... Salisbury steak.

166
00:19:39,971 --> 00:19:43,641
你可以吃上一顿热乎乎的饭，交些朋友。
You could get a nice, hot meal, make some friends.

167
00:19:44,351 --> 00:19:46,603
很多孩子不穿鞋去上学。
Plenty of kids go to school without shoes.

168
00:19:47,228 --> 00:19:50,106
但是你需要一条裙子。
But you will need a skirt.

169
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,274
向你妈妈要一个。
Ask your mama for one.

170
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:53,610
那就这样吧。
There you go.

171
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:57,572
找零是50美分。
And the change is 50 cents.

172
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:43,827
孩子们!
Boys!

173
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,079
蔡斯·安德鲁斯，你有什么要说的吗?
Chase Andrews, what you got to say for yourself?

174
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:47,705
对不起,小姐堇型花。
Sorry, Miss Pansy.

175
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,958
我们没看见你是因为那个女孩挡住了我们的路。
We didn't see you 'cause that girl got in the way.

176
00:20:52,544 --> 00:20:53,544
你好。
Hello there.

177
00:20:54,796 --> 00:20:58,216
我觉得你把自己转错方向了，小姑娘。
I think you've got yourself turned around the wrong way, little lady.

178
00:20:58,299 --> 00:20:59,968
学校不是那样的吗?
Isn't school that way?

179
00:21:00,051 --> 00:21:01,886
——那么脏。——恶心。
- So dirty. - Gross.

180
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:05,306
你也有同样的权利去那里。
You have just as much of a right to be there.

181
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:07,809
现在。没关系。
Go along now. It's all right.

182
00:21:13,815 --> 00:21:18,236
凯瑟琳·丹妮尔·克拉克小姐，你已经开始读书写字了吗?
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark, are you reading and writing already?

183
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,323
亲爱的，你会拼“狗”吗?
Can you spell "dog," honey?

184
00:21:26,786 --> 00:21:28,079
那是谁?
Who is that?

185
00:21:28,663 --> 00:21:32,333
G-O-D。
G-O-D.

186
00:21:34,502 --> 00:21:37,380
我们都可以多加练习，不是吗?
Well, we can all use practice, can't we?

187
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:41,259
请坐，凯瑟琳·丹妮尔·克拉克小姐。
You can go ahead and sit down, Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

188
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:45,388
你去哪儿了，沼泽母鸡?
Where you been, marsh hen?

189
00:21:45,472 --> 00:21:47,515
你的帽子呢，沼泽鼠?
Where's your hat, swamp rat?

190
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,936
现在，孩子们，安静下来。还有一个小时就吃午饭了。
Now, boys and girls, settle down. Just an hour until lunch.

191
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,439
请注意听我们的课。
Please, try to pay attention to our lesson.

192
00:21:54,522 --> 00:21:57,650
谁能告诉我哪个单词的元音很长?
Who can tell me a word that has a long vowel sound?

193
00:21:57,734 --> 00:22:00,945
-她可能住在泥里。-有人长虱子了。
- She probably lives in the mud. - Someone's got cooties.

194
00:22:01,029 --> 00:22:03,740
房间里有股臭味。
That stink in the room.

195
00:22:04,741 --> 00:22:05,742
原谅我。
Excuse me.

196
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:10,288
那是我在学校度过的唯一一天。
That was the only day I ever spent in school.

197
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:13,875
看来我还是向野外学习比较好。
Reckoned I was better off learning from the wild.

198
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,505
你好,泰特!
Hi, Tate!

199
00:22:34,687 --> 00:22:37,065
你在这里得小心点。听到了吗?
Need you to be careful out here. You hear me?

200
00:22:38,191 --> 00:22:39,609
你不能相信任何人。
You can't trust nobody.

201
00:22:40,443 --> 00:22:41,778
你保护你自己。
You protect yourself.

202
00:22:58,086 --> 00:22:59,754
可能是大角猫头鹰。
Great horned owl, probably.

203
00:23:01,923 --> 00:23:04,676
有一段时间，爸爸对我很好。
For a while, Pa was good to me.

204
00:23:12,642 --> 00:23:17,981
嗯哼。我想你可以用这个做羽毛，做鸟窝。
Ahem. I thought you could use this for your feathers, bird nests.

205
00:23:18,064 --> 00:23:19,566
你收集的其他东西。
Other stuff you collect.

206
00:23:22,652 --> 00:23:24,404
-谢谢。-是的。
- Oh, thank you. - Yeah.

207
00:23:31,703 --> 00:23:33,871
-那是我以前的军队…——邮件!
- It was my old Army... - Mail!

208
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,874
这是我以前的军用背包。
It's my old Army knapsack.

209
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:47,427
这是马!这是马!
It's from Ma! It's from Ma!

210
00:23:48,136 --> 00:23:50,138
这是马英九的笔迹!
It's Ma's handwriting!

211
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:52,473
——马英九的活着!-给我。
- Ma's alive! - Give it to me.

212
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,309
把它给我。
Give it to me.

213
00:24:00,481 --> 00:24:02,442
-她什么时候回家?——等待。
- When's she coming home? - Wait.

214
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:04,235
她怎么说?
What does she say?

215
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:10,241
——不!——安静。
- No! - Quiet.

216
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:13,244
爸爸!Pa,停!
Pa! Pa, stop!

217
00:24:13,328 --> 00:24:15,997
停止它!停止!
Stop it! Stop that!

218
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,749
——停止!——安静。安静!
- Stop! - Quiet. Quiet!

219
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:20,292
妈
Ma.

220
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:22,545
现在你听我说。
Now you listen to me.

221
00:24:23,463 --> 00:24:24,964
她再也不会回来了。
She ain't never coming back.

222
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,090
你听到我吗?
You hear me?

223
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,892
那不是真的。
That isn't true.

224
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,481
“Ain't”甚至都不是一个真实的词!
"Ain't" isn't even a real word!

225
00:24:52,367 --> 00:24:54,035
该死的婊子!
Goddamn bitch!

226
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:58,830
无用的。
Useless.

227
00:24:59,582 --> 00:25:02,043
爸爸烧掉了妈妈的所有踪迹。
Pa took to burning any trace of Ma.

228
00:25:03,211 --> 00:25:05,046
滚出我的房子。
Get your shit out of my house.

229
00:25:09,967 --> 00:25:13,554
然后有一天…他走了。
And then one day... he was gone.

230
00:25:16,182 --> 00:25:18,059
不像妈妈离开时那样痛苦。
Wasn't like the pain when Ma left.

231
00:25:18,142 --> 00:25:22,855
但完全的孤独是一种如此巨大的感觉，它产生了共鸣。
But being completely alone was a feeling so vast, it echoed.

232
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:45,920
还有一个幸存的小问题。
And there was the small matter of surviving.

233
00:25:50,091 --> 00:25:52,719
我不知道没有勇气该如何生活。
I didn't know how to do life without grits.

234
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:22,874
你好，Kya小姐。
Well, hello, Miss Kya.

235
00:26:27,128 --> 00:26:29,046
你想要什么吗?
You want something?

236
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:33,968
先生冒险乐园”……我听说你们都买贻贝。
Mr. Jumpin'... I hear tell y'all buy mussels.

237
00:26:34,844 --> 00:26:36,304
我这里有一些。
I got some here.

238
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:41,058
——他们新鲜的?-天亮前挖好
- They fresh? - Dug them before dawn.

239
00:26:41,142 --> 00:26:42,142
只是现在。
Just now.

240
00:26:42,727 --> 00:26:44,812
你爸让你带着这些出去的?
Your pa sent you out with these?

241
00:26:50,485 --> 00:26:55,907
这样吧，我给你五毛钱买一袋另一袋加满油。
Look, I tell you what, I'll give you 50 cent for the one bag and a full tank of gas for the other.

242
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,617
你们一周需要多少包?
How many bags y'all need a week?

243
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,911
我们要做笔生意吗?
Are we striking up a business deal?

244
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:06,000
我每两三天买40英镑。
I buy about 40 pound every two, three days.

245
00:27:06,584 --> 00:27:08,127
注意，其他人也会带。
Mind you, others bring them too.

246
00:27:08,211 --> 00:27:13,090
所以如果你带了，我已经带了一些，你就出局了。
So if you bring them, and I already got some, why, you'd just be out.

247
00:27:13,174 --> 00:27:16,594
先到先得。没有别的办法了。
It's first come, first served. Ain't no other way of doing it.

248
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,096
这很好。谢谢你！
That's fine. Thank you.

249
00:27:21,516 --> 00:27:22,558
我可以…吗?
Can I, uh...?

250
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:24,977
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

251
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,450
你长得真快啊?
You sure are growing up fast, huh?

252
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,120
你下周过来吧，我给你量量脚。
Why don't you come by next week, I'll measure your feet.

253
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:46,749
我在教堂的捐赠箱里放了几双鞋，正在收集灰尘。
I got some shoes in the church donation bin just collecting dust.

254
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,293
-谢谢，女士。——确定。
- Thank you, ma'am. - Sure.

255
00:28:01,097 --> 00:28:02,181
可怜的孩子。
Poor child.

256
00:28:03,516 --> 00:28:07,353
她妈妈走了，我猜现在她爸爸也走了。
Her ma's gone, and now her pa's gone too, I bet.

257
00:28:08,354 --> 00:28:09,438
什么?
What?

258
00:28:09,522 --> 00:28:12,859
我们应该小心，插手民间事务
We ought to be careful, messing in folk business.

259
00:28:12,942 --> 00:28:14,777
圣经里没有这么说。
It don't say that in the Bible.

260
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:16,070
“小心。”
"Be careful."

261
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:28,583
王要回答说、我实在告诉你们、弟兄们、你们这样待这些人中最小的、就是这样待我了。
"And the King shall answer and say unto them, verily I say unto thee, inasmuch as ye hath done it unto the least of these, my brethren, ye have done it unto me."

262
00:28:28,666 --> 00:28:29,792
好吧,梅布尔。
All right, Mabel.

263
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,295
不要说“小心”。
Don't say about "be careful."

264
00:28:45,391 --> 00:28:47,310
让我们来看看。
Let's see.

265
00:28:51,314 --> 00:28:53,065
一，二，三，就这样
One, two, three. That's all.

266
00:29:08,581 --> 00:29:10,082
是梅布尔小姐送的。
They're from Miss Mabel.

267
00:29:24,013 --> 00:29:35,858
北卡罗来纳州巴克利县的凯瑟琳·丹妮尔·克拉克被控一级谋杀蔡斯·劳伦斯·安德鲁斯，前巴克利湾人。
Catherine Danielle Clark, of Barkley County, North Carolina, is charged with the murder in the first degree of Chase Lawrence Andrews, formerly of Barkley Cove.

268
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:39,612
在这种情况下，允许国家要求判处死刑。
In such cases, the State is allowed to seek the death penalty.

269
00:29:39,695 --> 00:29:44,450
检方已经宣布，如果被告被判有罪，他们将会这样做。
The prosecution has announced it will do so if the defendant is found guilty.

270
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:47,036
有罪!我们都知道她有罪。
Guilty! We all know she's guilty.

271
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:50,206
她是有罪的。
She's guilty.

272
00:29:50,289 --> 00:29:52,333
现在开始挑选陪审团成员。
We will now begin jury selection.

273
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:59,131
前两排的准陪审员可否…还有一个选择。就是所谓的认罪协议。
Will our prospective jurors in the first two rows... There is an option. It's what's called a plea bargain.

274
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:13,980
意思是如果你愿意说你那晚确实去了塔楼在那里遇到了蔡斯·安德鲁斯你们发生了争执，发生了一场可怕的事故
And it means that if you are willing to say that you did go to the tower that night and met Chase Andrews there and you had a disagreement, and in a horrible accident

275
00:30:14,063 --> 00:30:20,111
他倒退着穿过栅栏，你会被判十年，但你会在六年内出狱。
he stepped backwards through the grate, you'd get ten years, but you'd be out in six.

276
00:30:20,194 --> 00:30:21,237
不。
No.

277
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:24,115
如果我们输了，我们损失惨重。
If we lose, we lose big.

278
00:30:24,198 --> 00:30:27,034
要么终身监禁，要么其他。
It's life in prison, or the other.

279
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:30,663
米尔顿先生，我不会说任何暗示内疚的话。
Mr. Milton, I won't say anything that implies guilt.

280
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:33,874
我不会进监狱的。
I will not go to prison.

281
00:30:33,958 --> 00:30:35,209
请叫我汤姆。
Please call me Tom.

282
00:30:35,292 --> 00:30:37,586
答应我你会考虑一下。
And promise me that you will think about this.

283
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:38,796
我得离开这里。
I have to get out of here.

284
00:30:40,464 --> 00:30:43,426
一个方法…或其他。
One way... or the other.

285
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:54,186
在10月30日午夜到凌晨2点之间…被告将蔡斯·安德鲁斯引诱到塔楼并将他推至死亡。
Between midnight and 2 a.m. on October 30th... the defendant lured Chase Andrews to the tower and pushed him to his death.

286
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,564
然后她掩盖了自己的踪迹和指纹。
She then covered up her tracks and fingerprints.

287
00:30:56,647 --> 00:31:01,652
现在，你会听到她有时间，她有动力，但最重要的是……
Now, you're gonna hear she had the time, she had the motivation, but most importantly...

288
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:08,242
她有谋杀蔡斯·安德鲁斯的性格弱点。
she has the weakness of character to murder Chase Andrews.

289
00:31:13,914 --> 00:31:22,381
女士们先生们，政府将对你们大谈特谈凯瑟琳·丹妮尔·克拉克小姐。
Ladies and gentlemen, the State is going to throw a lot of words at you about Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

290
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:30,473
但我希望你能看看控方提供的证据来证明这些话的真实性。
But I am asking you to look at the evidence that the State will be offering to back up those words.

291
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,768
你会发现没有。
You'll find that there is none.

292
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:51,285
此外，你们还会听到很有可能没有人谋杀了蔡斯·安德鲁斯，被告克拉克小姐之所以会被关在这里，是因为怪罪一个局外人比依靠事实要容易得多。
Furthermore, you are going to hear that there's a good chance no one murdered Chase Andrews and that the defendant, Miss Clark, finds herself here because it is easier to lay blame on an outsider than it is to rely on facts.

293
00:31:51,368 --> 00:32:00,211
虽然她出生和成长的地方离这个法庭不到五英里，但克拉克小姐是一个局外人。
And although she was born and grew up not five miles from this courtroom, Miss Clark is an outsider.

294
00:33:53,532 --> 00:33:54,617
哦。
Oh.

295
00:34:00,372 --> 00:34:01,372
嗨。
Hi.

296
00:34:01,749 --> 00:34:03,959
是我。泰特。
It's me. Tate.

297
00:34:26,649 --> 00:34:27,816
冻原天鹅。
Tundra swan.

298
00:34:29,318 --> 00:34:32,738
-你怎么认识鸟的?-我妈妈喜欢鸟。
- How do you know birds? - My ma liked birds.

299
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:37,952
我看不懂你的便条。
I can't read your note.

300
00:34:42,873 --> 00:34:51,090
我只是说我出去钓鱼的时候见过你几次，这让我想到也许你需要一些种子和一个火花塞。
Oh, all I said was I'd seen you a couple times when I was out fishing, and it got me thinking that maybe you could use some seeds and a spark plug.

301
00:34:51,173 --> 00:34:54,718
我有多余的。这样你就不用去城里了。
I had extra. Thought it might save you a trip to town.

302
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:59,139
我不知道，我想你会喜欢那些羽毛的。
And, uh, I don't know, I figured you'd like the feathers.

303
00:35:03,102 --> 00:35:04,353
那好吧
All right, then.

304
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:10,234
好吧
All right, then.

305
00:35:15,239 --> 00:35:17,199
我得走了，所以…
Well, I better be going, so...

306
00:35:24,873 --> 00:35:26,417
我可以教你读书。
I could teach you to read.

307
00:35:30,796 --> 00:35:33,215
我想你不妨同时学习写字。
I thought you may as well learn to write at the same time.

308
00:35:33,299 --> 00:35:34,925
哦,是的。
Oh, yeah.

309
00:35:35,009 --> 00:35:37,678
很好。好，我们从A开始。
Good. Okay, so we start with A.

310
00:35:38,887 --> 00:35:40,889
在这里画出这个形状。
Just go ahead and draw that shape right there.

311
00:35:52,318 --> 00:35:53,319
不要告诉我。
Don't tell me.

312
00:35:54,153 --> 00:35:55,321
你到达那里。
You're getting there.

313
00:35:55,404 --> 00:35:58,407
-别帮我。——确定。我有一整天时间。
- Don't help me. - Sure. I got all day.

314
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:10,961
“有些人没有野生动物可以生活，逗号，而有些人不能。”
"There are some who can live without wild things, comma, and some who cannot."

315
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,051
这就是我要说的，Kya。哇!
That's what I'm talking about, Kya. Whoo!

316
00:36:17,134 --> 00:36:19,970
再也不会有你不识字的时候了，永远不会。
And there will never be a time again where you can't read, ever.

317
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:22,723
我不知道文字能承载这么多东西。
I didn't know words could hold so much.

318
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:24,558
并不是所有的词语都能说明这么多。
Not all words hold that much.

319
00:36:29,438 --> 00:36:31,231
有空我们可以在我家看书。
We could read at my house sometime.

320
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:04,264
我们翻遍了整个图书馆。
We went through the whole library.

321
00:37:04,765 --> 00:37:07,601
每周三次，从夏天到秋天。
Three times a week, summer into fall.

322
00:37:10,687 --> 00:37:15,067
阅读植物和动物如何随着时间的推移来适应不断变化的地球。
Read how plants and animals change over time to adjust to the ever-shifting earth.

323
00:37:18,112 --> 00:37:24,785
鸟儿大多在黎明歌唱，因为清晨凉爽湿润的空气将它们的歌声和意义传播得更远。
How birds sing mostly at dawn because the cool, moist air of morning carries their songs and their meanings much farther.

324
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:37,798
一些细胞如何分裂并分化成肺或心脏，而另一些细胞仍未成为干细胞，以备日后需要。
How some cells divide and specialize into lungs or hearts while others remain uncommitted as stem cells in case they're needed later.

325
00:37:39,675 --> 00:37:47,015
在所有的生物学世界中……我寻找一个解释，为什么一个母亲会离开她的孩子。
Within all the worlds of biology... I searched for an explanation of why a mother would leave her offspring.

326
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:59,987
1933年6月12日，杰克逊·亨利·克拉克先生娶了朱丽安·玛丽亚·雅克小姐
"Mr. Jackson Henry Clark married Miss Julienne Maria Jacques, June 12, 1933."

327
00:38:01,238 --> 00:38:04,366
这意味着他们是我的父母。
That means these are my parents.

328
00:38:05,284 --> 00:38:08,912
"杰里米·安德鲁·克拉克少爷，1月2日"
"Master Jeremy Andrew Clark, January 2."

329
00:38:08,996 --> 00:38:10,122
这是朱迪。
That's Jodie.

330
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:18,964
"纳皮尔·墨菲·克拉克少爷，玛丽·海伦·克拉克小姐，凯瑟琳·丹妮尔·克拉克小姐"
"Master Napier Murphy Clark, Miss Mary Helen Clark, Miss Catherine Danielle Clark."

331
00:38:27,055 --> 00:38:28,140
我想念他们。
I miss them.

332
00:38:31,268 --> 00:38:32,269
我,嗯……
I had, um...

333
00:38:34,771 --> 00:38:39,401
我都忘了有多少钱了……我感觉他们不在这里。
I had forgot how much... I feel them not here.

334
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:47,367
但是…我感觉他们现在不在这里。
But... I feel them not here right now.

335
00:38:47,451 --> 00:38:48,577
我的意思是……
I mean...

336
00:38:51,663 --> 00:38:57,127
有时我觉得自己被忽视了……我想知道我是否在这里。
Sometimes I feel so invisible... I wonder if I'm here at all.

337
00:38:58,462 --> 00:38:59,462
你。
You are.

338
00:39:11,308 --> 00:39:13,602
-抱歉我迟到了。- - - - - -来吧。帮我一把。
- Sorry I'm late. - Come on. Give me a hand.

339
00:39:15,062 --> 00:39:17,314
孩子，你知道我不听空谈的。
Son, you know I don't listen to idle talk.

340
00:39:18,524 --> 00:39:23,320
但坊间一直有流言蜚语你和那个沼泽女孩有什么关系。
But there is a regular riptide of gossip going around you got something going on with that Marsh Girl.

341
00:39:25,113 --> 00:39:26,823
你什么都可以跟我说。
Hey, you know you can tell me anything.

342
00:39:27,658 --> 00:39:29,618
她是你女朋友?-她是我朋友。
- She your girlfriend? - She's my friend.

343
00:39:29,701 --> 00:39:32,871
我给她带书，因为人们对她很讨厌，她不能去上学。
I bring her books 'cause people are so nasty to her, she can't go to school.

344
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,290
她没有家人。
She doesn't have any family.

345
00:39:37,084 --> 00:39:41,213
嘿。来吧。没有必要生气。
Hey. Come on. There's no need to be huffy.

346
00:39:42,256 --> 00:39:48,762
我的工作就是把我们不喜欢谈论的事情都说出来，而我却不能给你很多其他爸爸能给他们儿子的东西。
It's my job to say all the things that we don't like to talk about, and I can't give you a lot of things those other dads can give their sons.

347
00:39:48,845 --> 00:39:50,055
所以我问你。
So I'm asking you.

348
00:39:50,973 --> 00:39:52,057
小心点
Just be careful.

349
00:39:53,058 --> 00:39:58,981
你为之努力的一切，你去教堂山的梦想…生活可以在一秒钟内改变。
Everything you've worked so hard for, your dreams of going to Chapel Hill... Life can change in a second.

350
00:40:01,525 --> 00:40:02,943
你明白吗?
You understand that?

351
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:04,319
是的。
Yeah.

352
00:40:04,403 --> 00:40:07,948
现在把我的音乐打开，好吗?来吧。
Now turn up my music, would you? Come on.

353
00:40:11,201 --> 00:40:13,287
是普契尼，如果你想知道的话。
It's Puccini, in case you're wondering.

354
00:40:33,307 --> 00:40:37,811
一个年轻女孩那样独自生活，你不觉得很不道德吗?
A young girl living on her own like that looks immoral, don't you think?

355
00:40:37,894 --> 00:40:40,814
不，先生，我不知道。认为,这是。
No, sir. I don't. Think, that is.

356
00:40:40,897 --> 00:40:43,525
至少还不够。问问我妻子就知道了。
At least not enough. Just ask my wife.

357
00:40:45,569 --> 00:40:50,532
有一些很好的团体之家可以让一个年轻女人远离麻烦。
There are some fine group homes that would help keep a young woman out of trouble.

358
00:40:52,534 --> 00:40:54,786
他们说她时不时来这里。
They say she comes in here from time to time.

359
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,414
我确实偶尔会见到她。
I do see her from time to time.

360
00:40:58,081 --> 00:41:00,500
她不是一个人。她爸爸和她在一起。
She's not alone. She's got her father with her.

361
00:41:00,584 --> 00:41:03,587
我来这的时候从没见过有人在家。
Well, I've never seen anybody home all the times I've been by.

362
00:41:04,504 --> 00:41:06,423
她通常什么时候来?
When does she usually come around?

363
00:41:06,506 --> 00:41:09,134
我不知道她什么时候会来。
I never know just when she'll boat in here.

364
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:12,471
让她下次来的时候给我打电话。
Have her call me next time she comes in.

365
00:41:15,932 --> 00:41:19,019
你没有任何理由对我撒谎，对吧，孩子?
You don't have any reason to lie to me, do you, boy?

366
00:41:19,102 --> 00:41:20,979
完全没有理由，先生。
No reason at all, sir.

367
00:41:37,621 --> 00:41:40,749
-我们得在别的地方见面——嗨,Kya。我也很高兴见到你。
- We gotta meet somewhere else. - Hi, Kya. Good to see you too.

368
00:41:40,832 --> 00:41:42,626
社会福利署又在找我了。
Social Services are looking for me again.

369
00:41:42,709 --> 00:41:44,920
他们会把我关起来，送去教养院。
They're gonna pull me in, put me in some group home.

370
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:47,005
当你见到别人时，向他们打招呼是有礼貌的。
It's polite to greet people when you see them.

371
00:41:53,428 --> 00:41:56,765
教养院也许不是最糟糕的事。
You know, a group home might not be the worst thing.

372
00:41:57,557 --> 00:42:00,519
什么?不,不。有人给你做热腾腾的饭菜。
What? No, no. You'd have someone cooking you warm meals.

373
00:42:00,602 --> 00:42:02,688
——真正的床。-我有一张真正的床。
- Real bed. - I got a real bed.

374
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,983
“再说，我也不会离开沼泽地去和一群陌生人住在一起。
'Sides, I'd never leave the marsh to go live with a bunch of strangers.

375
00:42:07,067 --> 00:42:09,569
是"除此之外"，不是"两边"
It's "besides," not "'sides."

376
00:42:10,237 --> 00:42:12,197
你也不能永远一个人住在沼泽里。
And you can't live alone in the marsh forever.

377
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,281
看我。
Watch me.

378
00:42:14,658 --> 00:42:15,659
好吧。
All right.

379
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:32,801
泰特。
Tate.

380
00:42:34,177 --> 00:42:35,345
我,嗯…
I, um...

381
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:43,770
我很感激你教我读书以及你给予我的一切。
I appreciate you teaching me to read and all the things you gave me.

382
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,106
但是你为什么要这么做呢?
But why do you do it?

383
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,443
你没有女朋友吗?
Don't you have a girlfriend or something?

384
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,778
有时我做的。
Sometimes I do.

385
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:53,612
有时吗?
Sometimes?

386
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,284
我是说，我有过一次。
I mean, I've had one.

387
00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:03,457
呃，但不是现在……我不,所以…
Uh, but not now... I don't, so...

388
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:09,880
呃,好吧。
Uh, all right.

389
00:43:09,963 --> 00:43:15,135
我,嗯…那天我在你爸的船上看到你了。
I, uh... I saw you on your pa's boat the other day.

390
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,597
你爸爸看起来人很好。
He seems real nice, your dad.

391
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:20,515
是的。是的,他是。
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

392
00:43:21,224 --> 00:43:23,393
你从不谈论你妈妈。
You never talk about your ma.

393
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:26,730
她喜欢什么?
What's she like?

394
00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:35,405
你什么都不用说。
Uh, you don't have to say nothing.

395
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:40,702
我母亲和妹妹死于阿什维尔的一场车祸。
My mother and little sister died in a car wreck over in Asheville.

396
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,416
我妹妹的名字叫卡里安。
My little sister's name was Carianne.

397
00:43:49,544 --> 00:43:50,796
这是,呃…
It was, uh...

398
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,469
什么,泰特?
What, Tate?

399
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,597
你可以对我说任何事。
You can say anything to me.

400
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:09,689
我想他们去阿什维尔给我买生日礼物了。
I think they went to Asheville to buy me my birthday present.

401
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:16,738
有一辆我想要的自行车，西部汽车公司没有卖……
There was this bike I wanted, and Western Auto didn't carry it...

402
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,868
所以我想他们是去阿什维尔给我买自行车的。
so I think they went into Asheville to get that bike for me.

403
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,912
哦。
Oh.

404
00:44:24,746 --> 00:44:27,165
我甚至不记得那是什么车了。
And I don't even remember what kind of bike it was.

405
00:44:31,503 --> 00:44:32,963
这不是你的错。
It wasn't your fault.

406
00:44:44,599 --> 00:44:45,599
哦!
Oh!

407
00:44:48,395 --> 00:44:49,896
哦,我的天哪!
Oh, my gosh!

408
00:45:13,253 --> 00:45:14,754
我现在是你女朋友了吗?
Am I your girlfriend now?

409
00:45:14,838 --> 00:45:16,006
你想吗?
Do you wanna be?

410
00:45:17,299 --> 00:45:18,341
我知道羽毛。
I know feathers.

411
00:45:20,176 --> 00:45:22,345
我打赌其他女孩不懂羽毛。
Bet the other girls don't know feathers.

412
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,390
好吧,。
All right, then.

413
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:27,767
好吧,。
All right, then.

414
00:46:40,507 --> 00:46:43,218
-我从来没走这条路。-值得一趟。
- I've never been out this way. - It's worth the trip.

415
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:44,760
你会看到。
You'll see.

416
00:46:46,096 --> 00:46:47,097
生日快乐,Kya。
Happy birthday, Kya.

417
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:51,977
你怎么知道今天是我生日?
How'd you know it was my birthday?

418
00:46:52,060 --> 00:46:53,645
我在你的《圣经》里读到过。
Oh, I read it in your Bible.

419
00:46:56,314 --> 00:46:58,066
你知道今天是你的生日吗?
Did you know it was your birthday?

420
00:46:59,359 --> 00:47:00,694
不要有日历。
Don't have a calendar.

421
00:47:04,447 --> 00:47:06,408
哦，不是我的名字。
Oh, um, not my name.

422
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:07,575
别划我的名字。
Don't cut my name.

423
00:47:07,659 --> 00:47:08,785
是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

424
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,507
-不错吧?
- Mm! - Pretty good, huh?

425
00:47:25,135 --> 00:47:26,219
那是什么?
What's that?

426
00:47:27,387 --> 00:47:28,680
在这里,他们来了。
Here they come.

427
00:47:38,565 --> 00:47:39,566
哦,哇。
Oh, wow.

428
00:47:40,984 --> 00:47:42,318
雪雁。
Snow geese.

429
00:48:14,893 --> 00:48:16,061
Kya。
Kya.

430
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:18,104
Kya，看着我。
Kya, look at me.

431
00:49:06,986 --> 00:49:08,071
Kya。
Kya.

432
00:49:09,197 --> 00:49:11,324
Kya,对不起。
Kya, I'm sorry.

433
00:49:12,033 --> 00:49:13,034
我很抱歉。
I'm sorry.

434
00:49:14,702 --> 00:49:15,703
天啊
Jeez.

435
00:49:18,373 --> 00:49:20,500
不，泰特，我想。
No, Tate, I want to.

436
00:49:21,918 --> 00:49:22,918
为什么不呢?
Why not?

437
00:49:24,295 --> 00:49:25,295
因为我……
Because I...

438
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,967
我太在乎你了。
I care about you too much.

439
00:49:29,884 --> 00:49:35,765
听着,Kya。我想要你胜过一切，但是我不会那么容易被伤害。
Look, Kya. I want you more than anything, but I can't be damaged as easily.

440
00:49:35,849 --> 00:49:38,434
对你来说更危险。你明白吗?
It's more dangerous for you. You understand?

441
00:49:51,781 --> 00:49:53,658
秋天让位于冬天。
Fall gave way to winter.

442
00:49:54,409 --> 00:49:55,869
冬天到春天。
Winter to spring.

443
00:49:57,412 --> 00:50:00,248
自然界唯一不变的就是变化。
The only constant in nature is change.

444
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:01,499
爸爸，我被录取了!
Dad, I got in!

445
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:25,356
你为什么不说话?
Why are you quiet?

446
00:50:27,400 --> 00:50:29,110
你知道我马上就要走了。
You know I'm going away soon.

447
00:50:30,028 --> 00:50:31,029
大学。
To college.

448
00:50:33,406 --> 00:50:34,616
你们谈过了。
You talked about it.

449
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:37,743
什么时候?
When?

450
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,288
不是现在。
Not right away.

451
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,125
很快。
Soon.

452
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,253
我在生物实验室找了份工作。
I got a job at the biology lab.

453
00:50:48,213 --> 00:50:49,714
下周开始，所以…
Starts next week, so...

454
00:51:01,643 --> 00:51:02,644
待在这
Stay here.

455
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:04,771
然后呢?
And do what?

456
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:10,735
不,听着。我只是说这里没有我的工作。
No, look. I just mean there's no work for me here.

457
00:51:10,818 --> 00:51:13,613
我该怎么办?我不想像我爸爸那样捕虾。
What am I gonna do? I don't want to be a shrimper like my dad.

458
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,282
我要拿个学位，有所成就，Kya。
I'm going to get a degree and be something, Kya.

459
00:51:16,366 --> 00:51:18,701
-你也可以。-你想让我成为什么?
- So could you. - What do you want me to be?

460
00:51:20,203 --> 00:51:22,705
-我不是这个意思-你再也回不来了
- That's not what I meant. - You're never gonna come back.

461
00:51:22,789 --> 00:51:25,833
是的,我会的。我不会离开你的，Kya。我保证。
Yes, I will. I won't leave you, Kya. I promise.

462
00:51:25,917 --> 00:51:27,252
我会回到你身边。
I'm gonna come back to you.

463
00:51:28,294 --> 00:51:34,550
Kya !Kya,停止!肯塔基州……你不能每缝一针都跑掉!
Kya! Kya, stop! Ky... You can't run away from every whip stitch!

464
00:51:55,363 --> 00:51:57,907
-再过一晚。-再过一晚。
- One more night. - One more night.

465
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:24,100
这是什么?
What's this?

466
00:52:26,311 --> 00:52:28,604
这是出版商的名单。
It's a list of publishers.

467
00:52:29,605 --> 00:52:31,149
感谢你所有的画和笔记。
For all your drawings and notes.

468
00:52:31,232 --> 00:52:33,443
世界上没有比他们更好的了，Kya。
There's nothing like them out there, Kya.

469
00:52:33,860 --> 00:52:35,653
这些足够写一本书。
There's enough for a book.

470
00:52:35,737 --> 00:52:37,113
大量的书。
Lots of books.

471
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:40,992
而且，你知道，你不需要离开家。
And, you know, you wouldn't have to leave home.

472
00:52:41,701 --> 00:52:44,162
你可以直接把样品寄给出版商。
You could just mail your samples into a publisher.

473
00:52:44,871 --> 00:52:46,414
你知道，赚点钱。
You know, bring some money in.

474
00:52:47,832 --> 00:52:54,380
你知道，可能不会很多……但也许你下半辈子就不用去挖贻贝了。
You know, probably not a huge amount... but maybe you wouldn't have to dig mussels the rest of your life.

475
00:52:56,007 --> 00:52:57,258
试试看吧，Kya。
Just give it a try, Kya.

476
00:52:59,469 --> 00:53:00,803
来吧。有什么坏处呢?
Come on. What can it hurt?

477
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:06,392
你会忘记我的。
You're gonna forget about me.

478
00:53:08,811 --> 00:53:12,815
当你忙着大学那些事的时候，那些漂亮女孩。
When you get busy with all that college stuff, all those pretty girls.

479
00:53:12,899 --> 00:53:14,692
我永远不会忘记你，Kya。
I could never forget you, Kya.

480
00:53:15,568 --> 00:53:16,568
永远。
Ever.

481
00:53:18,988 --> 00:53:22,784
我一个月后就回家了。我保证。为了7月4日。好吗?
I'll be home in a month. I promise. For the Fourth of July. Okay?

482
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:26,120
我很快就回来了。
I'll be back before you know it.

483
00:53:26,704 --> 00:53:29,499
我们在你的海滩见面，一起看烟花。
We'll meet on your beach and watch fireworks together.

484
00:53:30,041 --> 00:53:32,168
给那些出版商写信，好吗?
Just write those publishers, all right?

485
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:54,732
再见,Kya。
Goodbye, Kya.

486
00:53:55,858 --> 00:53:56,943
再见,泰特。
Goodbye, Tate.

487
00:54:25,304 --> 00:54:27,473
东海岸的海鸟。
Seabirds of the Eastern Seaboard.

488
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:30,184
由你主演，大红。
Starring you, Big Red.

489
00:56:31,722 --> 00:56:32,723
不。
No.

490
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:38,229
不。
No.

491
00:56:40,106 --> 00:56:41,148
不,泰特。
No, Tate.

492
00:56:44,986 --> 00:56:46,028
不,不。
No, no.

493
00:56:46,571 --> 00:56:47,572
不。
No.

494
00:56:49,865 --> 00:56:50,865
不。
No.

495
00:56:53,536 --> 00:56:54,536
不。
No.

496
00:56:55,413 --> 00:56:58,082
不,不,不。
No, no, no.

497
00:57:12,597 --> 00:57:15,891
泰特，生命和爱是同一件事。
Tate and life and love had been the same thing.

498
00:57:17,226 --> 00:57:18,436
他们都走了。
They were all gone.

499
00:57:22,064 --> 00:57:23,065
然后……
And then...

500
00:57:45,713 --> 00:57:49,634
每当我跌倒时，沼泽就把我吞没了。
Whenever I stumbled, the marsh caught me.

501
00:57:57,183 --> 00:58:03,439
终于，在某个无人认领的时刻，心的痛像水渗进了沙子，慢慢地消失了。
At some unclaimed moment, at last, the heart pain seeped away, like water into sand.

502
00:58:03,522 --> 00:58:05,274
仍然在那里，但很深。
Still there, but deep.

503
00:58:07,526 --> 00:58:11,155
尸体周围和消防塔上都没有脚印。
There were no footprints around the body or on the fire tower.

504
00:58:11,238 --> 00:58:13,032
也没有新的指纹。
And no fresh fingerprints either.

505
00:58:13,115 --> 00:58:15,993
连格栅都没有，必须有人打开。
Not even on the grate, which somebody had to open.

506
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:18,537
所有这些都表明有人销毁了证据。
All this indicated that someone had destroyed evidence.

507
00:58:18,621 --> 00:58:19,747
没有问题了。
No more questions.

508
00:58:21,290 --> 00:58:22,583
该你问了
Your witness.

509
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:37,890
警长，我把10月29日晚上和10月30日早上的潮汐表交给你。
Sheriff, I'm handing you the tide table for the night of October 29 and the morning of October 30.

510
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:43,270
这里显示低潮是在午夜前后。
Now, this shows here that low tide was around midnight.

511
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:51,779
所以当蔡斯·安德鲁斯到达塔楼，走向台阶时，他会在湿泥上留下脚印。
So at the time Chase Andrews arrived at the tower and walked to the steps, he would have made tracks in the wet mud.

512
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:57,118
然后随着地下水的上升，这些痕迹就会消失。
And then as the groundwater rose, those tracks would have been wiped out.

513
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:06,711
-你同意这是可能的吗?——嗯…然后你会同意如果他有朋友在身边，他们的脚印也会被洗掉。
- Do you agree that this is possible? - Well... And then you'd agree that if he had any friends with him, their footprints would be washed away as well.

514
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:15,177
在这种情况下，没有脚印本身并不意味着犯罪。
Under these circumstances, the absence of footprints in and of itself does not suggest a crime.

515
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:16,846
对吗?
Correct?

516
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:20,932
警长?
Sheriff?

517
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:28,315
没有脚印本身并不能证明有过犯罪。
The absence of footprints does not, by itself, prove there was a crime.

518
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:35,698
你还作证说在消防塔的任何地方都没有发现指纹，包括在敞开的壁炉上。
You also testified that there were no fingerprints found anywhere in the fire tower, including on the open grate.

519
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:44,165
所以这让你得出结论一定是有人打开了格栅然后擦去了指纹。
So this led you to conclude that someone must have opened the grate and wiped away their fingerprints afterwards.

520
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,249
没错
Correct.

521
00:59:46,333 --> 01:00:03,517
事实上，这些栅栏门是不是经常开着，被认为很危险以至于你们办公室在去年7月18日向美国林务局提交了一份书面申请，要求补救这种情况?
Now, in fact, isn't it true that these grates were left open so often and considered so dangerous that your office submitted a written request to the U.S. Forest Service to remedy the situation on July 18 of last year?

522
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:08,856
这是那个请求的副本。
This is a copy of that request.

523
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:12,234
这是谁写的，警长?
Who wrote this, sheriff?

524
01:00:13,819 --> 01:00:14,862
我自己做的。
I did it myself.

525
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:20,910
你能向法庭宣读一下你寄给林务局的这份文件的最后一句话吗?
Would you read to the court the last sentence of this document that you sent to the Forest Service?

526
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,078
只有最后一句话。
Just the last sentence.

527
01:00:23,788 --> 01:00:28,375
“我必须重复一遍，这些炉栅非常危险，如果不采取行动……
"I must repeat, these grates are very dangerous, and if action is not taken...

528
01:00:31,587 --> 01:00:35,216
如果不采取行动，就会发生严重的伤害或死亡。”
If action is not taken, a serious injury or death will occur."

529
01:00:37,510 --> 01:00:39,053
谢谢你,长官。
Thank you, sheriff.

530
01:01:26,183 --> 01:01:28,769
有人在我家附近拍照。
Somebody's been taking pictures round my house.

531
01:01:28,853 --> 01:01:30,521
你觉得他们想要什么?
What do you think they want?

532
01:01:31,272 --> 01:01:32,273
开发人员。
Developers.

533
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:39,196
过去几周，他们一直在沼泽里来回走动，想把“阴暗的沼泽”的水抽干。建立酒店。
They've been all up and down the marsh last few weeks, wanting to drain the "murky swamp." Build hotels.

534
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,656
是的，我去年见过。
Yeah, I saw them last year.

535
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:44,201
砍橡树，挖沟渠。
Cutting oak and digging channels down the way.

536
01:01:44,952 --> 01:01:45,953
他们想要我的房子?
They want my house?

537
01:01:46,036 --> 01:01:49,740
也许不是房子，但我打赌他们会给你一大笔钱买那块地。
Maybe not the house, but I bet they offer you a heap of money for that land.

538
01:01:49,790 --> 01:01:50,791
冒险乐园”!
Jumpin'!

539
01:01:50,875 --> 01:01:53,294
给Kya一些钱并没有什么错。
There ain't nothing wrong with some money going to Kya.

540
01:01:56,005 --> 01:01:59,133
那块地是你的，对吧?那房子是你的?
You do own that land, don't you? You own that house?

541
01:02:02,177 --> 01:02:03,470
爸爸这样说。
Pa said so.

542
01:02:03,554 --> 01:02:05,472
你需要一些证据。
Well, you're gonna need some proof.

543
01:02:05,556 --> 01:02:07,725
一个契约,标题。
A deed, title.

544
01:02:12,438 --> 01:02:13,439
嘿。
Hey.

545
01:02:13,522 --> 01:02:16,191
抱歉吓到你了。我可以帮你拿吗?
Sorry to startle you. Can I carry that for ya?

546
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:19,945
-我知道了。——请。我来拿。
- I got it. - Please. Let me get it.

547
01:02:21,405 --> 01:02:22,990
我是蔡斯·安德鲁斯。
Oh, I'm Chase Andrews.

548
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:25,826
你叫Kya，对吧?
Your name's Kya, right?

549
01:02:27,494 --> 01:02:31,373
是的。是的。这是个好名字。我喜欢它。它很不同，但很好。
Yeah. Yeah. It's a nice name. I like it. It's different but nice.

550
01:02:34,209 --> 01:02:35,336
这是你的。
This is yours right here.

551
01:02:37,338 --> 01:02:38,464
好了。
There we go.

552
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,094
这周日想坐我的船去野餐吗?
You wanna go for a picnic in my boat this Sunday?

553
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:51,310
好的。
Okay.

554
01:02:51,393 --> 01:02:53,979
我中午去Point Beach接你。这工作吗?
I'll pick you up at noon from Point Beach. Does that work?

555
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,191
好的。好了，再见，Kya。
All right. Well, I'll see ya, Kya.

556
01:03:08,869 --> 01:03:09,995
好了，我们到了。
Well, here we are.

557
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:14,291
纳皮尔·克拉克先生好像在1897年买的。
Mr. Napier Clark, looks like, bought it in 1897.

558
01:03:14,875 --> 01:03:17,169
是的，那是我爷爷。
Yeah, uh, that's my grandpa.

559
01:03:18,003 --> 01:03:19,088
是的,女士。
Yes, ma'am.

560
01:03:19,797 --> 01:03:24,802
从来没有卖过，所以，是的，先生，我想这是你的。
It's never been sold, so, yes sirree, I reckon it belongs to you.

561
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:29,098
看来你要想留着它就得补缴一些税，克拉克小姐。
Looks like you gotta pay some back taxes if you wanna keep it, Miss Clark.

562
01:03:29,682 --> 01:03:37,523
事实上，女士，根据法律规定，谁来补缴税款，谁就拥有土地，即使他们没有契约。
In fact, ma'am, the way the law reads, uh, whoever comes along and pays those back taxes owns the land, even if they don't got no deed.

563
01:03:38,482 --> 01:03:39,608
嗯,多少钱?
Well, how much?

564
01:03:39,692 --> 01:03:41,485
看起来像……
Looks like about...

565
01:03:46,031 --> 01:03:47,741
总共八百美元。
Eight hundred dollars total.

566
01:04:05,259 --> 01:04:06,760
五年。
Five years.

567
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:11,306
泰特给我指明这条路已经五年了。
It had been five years since Tate showed me this path.

568
01:04:12,141 --> 01:04:21,608
亲爱的先生或女士，我寄给你以下几页关于卡罗莱纳沼泽的贝壳，供你考虑。
Dear Sir or Madam, I am sending you the following pages on the shells of the Carolina marsh for your consideration.

569
01:04:24,486 --> 01:04:27,364
五年时间让我的心再次打开它的壳。
Five years for my heart to open its shell again.

570
01:04:39,001 --> 01:04:41,336
置身于音乐天才面前感觉如何?
How's it feel to bask in the presence of musical genius?

571
01:04:48,510 --> 01:04:49,636
嘿,你看。
Hey, look.

572
01:04:52,306 --> 01:04:55,350
哦。哦!那是一个华丽的扇贝。
Oh. Oh! That's an ornate scallop.

573
01:04:56,226 --> 01:04:57,478
梳状突起ornatus。
Pecten ornatus.

574
01:04:57,561 --> 01:04:58,729
好吧。
All right.

575
01:05:00,105 --> 01:05:03,233
-嗯，在这里找到一个很不寻常。——真的?
- Well, it's unusual to find one here. - Really?

576
01:05:04,026 --> 01:05:10,032
是的。这种特殊的物种通常生活在这里的南部地区，因为这片水域对它们来说太冷了。
Yeah. This particular species usually inhabits regions south of here 'cause these waters are too cool for them.

577
01:05:12,409 --> 01:05:13,409
什么?
What?

578
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:21,502
不，只是，沼泽女孩知道贝壳的拉丁名字它们住在哪里还有为什么，天啊。
Oh, no, it's just, the Marsh Girl knows the Latin name for shells and where they inhabit and why, for Christ sakes.

579
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:24,129
在这里。你保留它。
Here. You keep it.

580
01:05:27,132 --> 01:05:28,133
谢谢你！
Thank you.

581
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:34,765
你是另一个人，不是吗?
You're something else, ain't ya?

582
01:05:59,289 --> 01:06:01,834
我知道你觉得我是垃圾，但我可比野餐值钱多了。
I know you think I'm trash, but I'm worth more than a picnic.

583
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,210
哦,不,Kya。来吧。
Oh, no, Kya. Come on.

584
01:06:03,293 --> 01:06:06,255
我很抱歉。不。嘿,来吧。我从没想过你是垃圾。
I'm sorry. No. Hey, come on. I've never thought you were trash.

585
01:06:07,422 --> 01:06:08,507
请。我很抱歉。
Please. I'm sorry.

586
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:11,510
如果你想走，我能理解，但你不能从这里走出去。
I understand if you wanna go, but you can't walk from here.

587
01:06:11,593 --> 01:06:12,593
太远了。
It's too far.

588
01:06:13,262 --> 01:06:14,680
我能补偿你吗?
Can I make it up to you?

589
01:06:17,266 --> 01:06:19,268
求你了，我能补偿你吗?
Please, can I make it up to you?

590
01:06:21,937 --> 01:06:24,148
真不敢相信你从没上过消防塔。
I can't believe you never been up the fire tower.

591
01:06:24,231 --> 01:06:27,484
当我的家人都在管我的事的时候，你来这里。你知道吗?
Come here when my family's all in my business. You know?

592
01:06:29,027 --> 01:06:31,530
这是从上面俯瞰整个沼泽的好方法。
It's a great way to see the whole marsh from above.

593
01:06:36,994 --> 01:06:37,994
这里。
Here.

594
01:07:03,437 --> 01:07:04,479
它是什么?
What is it?

595
01:07:06,273 --> 01:07:08,525
你可以告诉我。我不会嘲笑你的。
You can tell me. I won't laugh at you.

596
01:07:09,818 --> 01:07:14,698
就像你有一个一辈子的朋友，但你从来没见过他们的脸。
It's like having a friend your whole life, but you never saw their full face.

597
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:18,243
现在我看到了。
Now I see it.

598
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:26,335
你的房子在那边，是吗?
Your house is over there, ain't it?

599
01:07:30,589 --> 01:07:31,632
带我去那儿。
Take me there.

600
01:07:32,382 --> 01:07:36,929
哦,嗯…——这是太远了。-嘿，我喜欢远。
Oh, um... - It's far. - Hey, I like far.

601
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:41,433
我才不管怎么样，如果你担心的是这个的话。
I don't care what it's like, if that's what you're worried about.

602
01:07:48,106 --> 01:07:49,483
就是这里吗?
Is this it right here?

603
01:07:52,527 --> 01:07:54,696
你一个人在这住了多久了?
How long you lived out here by yourself?

604
01:07:54,780 --> 01:07:56,490
我想大概有十年了。
Uh, about ten years, I think.

605
01:07:57,532 --> 01:07:58,532
整洁。
Neat.

606
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:01,745
住在这里，没有父母告诉你该怎么做?
Living out here with no parents telling you what to do?

607
01:08:04,456 --> 01:08:06,750
里面真的没什么可看的。
There's really nothing to see inside.

608
01:08:09,878 --> 01:08:11,922
-门廊上放了什么?——什么?
- Wow, what you got on the porch? - What?

609
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:14,341
哦,嗯,什么都没有。
Oh, um, nothing.

610
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:26,645
这是什么?
What is all this?

611
01:08:27,813 --> 01:08:28,855
什么都没有。
Nothing.

612
01:08:35,404 --> 01:08:37,948
你是在写书吗?
What, you writing a book or something?

613
01:08:39,366 --> 01:08:40,367
排序的。
Sort of.

614
01:08:41,493 --> 01:08:44,037
这些看起来就像从百科全书里翻出来的。
These look straight out of an encyclopedia.

615
01:08:47,165 --> 01:08:48,792
你真的很厉害，不是吗?
You're the real deal, ain't ya?

616
01:08:52,421 --> 01:08:53,463
啊,斯旺尼河。
Ah, swanee.

617
01:08:54,131 --> 01:08:55,882
你有一个水泵。
You got a water pump.

618
01:08:57,801 --> 01:08:59,219
我还没准备好接待客人。
I wasn't ready for guests.

619
01:08:59,303 --> 01:09:00,512
嘿,别担心。
Hey, don't worry.

620
01:09:04,016 --> 01:09:07,060
我认识的人没人能像这样独自住在这里。
Hey, there's nobody I know who could live out here alone like this.

621
01:09:07,936 --> 01:09:10,230
我是说，大多数男人会很害怕。
I mean, most guys would be too scared.

622
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:14,776
你找我干什么?
What do you want with me?

623
01:09:19,823 --> 01:09:23,243
好的。听着，我真的很抱歉我那样对你。
Okay. Look, I'm real sorry I came on like that.

624
01:09:23,327 --> 01:09:25,996
我想进一步了解你。好吧?
I wanna get to know you better. All right?

625
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:27,581
我觉得你很漂亮。
I think you're gorgeous.

626
01:09:28,999 --> 01:09:33,045
我做的事。我觉得你很自由，也很聪明。
I do. I think you're free as a dang gale and smart as a whip.

627
01:09:34,963 --> 01:09:37,257
但如果你不让我做，我什么都不会做。
But I won't do anything unless you want me to.

628
01:09:38,592 --> 01:09:39,592
这是怎么回事?
How's that?

629
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:43,930
这很好。
That's fine.

630
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:46,725
好吧。
All right.

631
01:09:58,070 --> 01:10:00,781
我不知道我对蔡斯是什么感觉。
I didn't know exactly how I felt about Chase.

632
01:10:01,531 --> 01:10:03,283
但我不再孤独。
But I was no longer lonely.

633
01:10:04,159 --> 01:10:05,452
这似乎不够。
That seemed enough.

634
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:09,081
是为你的书准备的吗?
Is that for your book?

635
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:11,041
是的。
Yeah.

636
01:10:11,958 --> 01:10:14,294
不管怎样，谁知道会不会有人读。
Anyway, who knows if anyone will read it.

637
01:10:15,087 --> 01:10:16,087
我会的。
I will.

638
01:10:17,214 --> 01:10:18,882
沼泽是我们的秘密。
The marsh was our secret.

639
01:10:29,101 --> 01:10:30,811
跟我说说你的朋友。
Tell me about your friends.

640
01:10:31,019 --> 01:10:32,938
我其实没有什么朋友。
Oh, I don't really have any friends.

641
01:10:35,190 --> 01:10:38,235
当你和他们在一起的时候，你似乎总是玩得很开心。
You always seem to be having a good time when you're with them.

642
01:10:38,318 --> 01:10:39,319
你在监视我?
You spying on me?

643
01:10:44,449 --> 01:10:49,913
这很有趣。我爸爸有次告诉我，他喝了点东西和我妈妈吵了一架。
It's funny. My dad told me once, he'd had something to drink and a fight with my mom.

644
01:10:51,331 --> 01:10:54,960
他告诉我，如果我的朋友真的了解我，他们就不会是我的朋友。
He told me if my friends really knew me, they wouldn't be my friends.

645
01:10:56,878 --> 01:11:02,342
我想说的是，我不知道是否有人真正了解我。
I don't know if anyone really knows me, is what I'm saying, I guess.

646
01:11:06,847 --> 01:11:08,682
我想知道是什么让天空变成蓝色的。
I wonder what makes the sky blue.

647
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:12,978
来自阳光的蓝色和紫色波长。
Blue and violet wavelengths from sunlight.

648
01:11:14,271 --> 01:11:19,151
它们会被大气中的气体粒子反射并散射。
They, uh, bounce off the gas particles in the atmosphere and scatter.

649
01:11:26,616 --> 01:11:30,370
我现在可以吻你吗?
Is it okay if I... kiss you now?

650
01:11:42,299 --> 01:11:48,054
我们来看看蔡斯·安德鲁斯死那晚在他的牛仔夹克上发现的红色羊毛纤维。
Let's turn to the red wool fibers found on Chase Andrews' denim jacket the night he died.

651
01:11:49,014 --> 01:11:52,225
你把这些样本和这顶红色滑雪帽做了比较吗?
Did you compare those samples to this red ski cap?

652
01:11:52,309 --> 01:11:53,310
证据三
Exhibit C.

653
01:11:53,393 --> 01:11:57,439
是的。帽子和夹克上的纤维完全吻合。
Yes. The fibers from the cap and the jacket matched exactly.

654
01:11:57,522 --> 01:11:59,274
那顶帽子是在哪里找到的?
And where was that cap found?

655
01:11:59,357 --> 01:12:01,902
是在克拉克小姐的住处发现的。
It was found in Miss Clark's residence.

656
01:12:03,612 --> 01:12:10,160
关于这些红色纤维，医生，有没有办法，确定纤维在夹克上停留了多久?
Now, about these red fibers, is there any way, doctor, to determine how long the fibers had been on the jacket?

657
01:12:10,243 --> 01:12:13,872
不。我们知道它们从哪里来，而不是什么时候。
No. We can tell where they came from, not when.

658
01:12:13,955 --> 01:12:19,753
如果有人经常戴这种帽子，头发和衣服上会有纤维吗?
And if someone wore this hat often, is it possible the fibers would be in their hair and on their clothes?

659
01:12:19,836 --> 01:12:23,131
是的。我想他们可以。
Yes. I would suppose they could.

660
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:33,266
所以你是否同意，在被告克拉克小姐，认识蔡斯·安德鲁斯的这几年里，帽子的纤维有可能被转移到蔡斯的外套上?
So would you agree that at any time during the years that the defendant, Miss Clark, knew Chase Andrews, the fibers of the hat could have been transferred onto Chase's jacket?

661
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,894
就我所见，是的。
From what I've seen, yes.

662
01:12:35,977 --> 01:12:39,314
-他们见面的任何时候。——是的。
- At any time they met. - Yes.

663
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:59,000
亲爱的克拉克小姐，我们被你的手稿迷住了。
"Dear Miss Clark, we were fascinated by your manuscript.

664
01:12:59,751 --> 01:13:06,550
如果如你所说，你的材料已经完成，我们希望能及时编辑出版。”
If, as you say, your materials are already complete, we hope to edit and publish in record time."

665
01:13:12,430 --> 01:13:15,850
嘿。你面前是西部汽车公司的新经理。
Hey. You're looking at the new manager of Western Auto.

666
01:13:17,936 --> 01:13:22,232
哦,追逐,…-真是个好消息。- - - - - -来吧。让我们好好庆祝一下。
Oh, Chase, that's... - That's great news. - Come on. Let's celebrate.

667
01:13:34,369 --> 01:13:38,164
他们会付你画这些画的钱吗?
So they're gonna, uh, pay you for those drawings?

668
01:13:38,248 --> 01:13:39,249
是的。
Yeah.

669
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:41,710
噢!
Ooh!

670
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:47,340
我想，只是别太自以为是了。
Just don't get too full of yourself, I guess.

671
01:13:48,550 --> 01:13:49,551
我不会。
I wouldn't.

672
01:13:53,638 --> 01:13:55,849
我知道人们让你失望了。
I know people have disappointed you.

673
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:58,810
对此我很抱歉。
And I'm sorry for that.

674
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:07,193
被自己的家人抛弃。我的意思是……天啊，我的家人真是让人头疼，但我觉得我承受不了。
Getting left by your own family. I mean... God, my family's a pain in the ass, but I don't think I could take that.

675
01:14:07,777 --> 01:14:10,196
但我想让你知道我会照顾好你的。
But I want you to know that I'm gonna take care of you.

676
01:14:12,073 --> 01:14:15,452
现在我升职了，我们结婚的时候我可以给你买一栋漂亮的房子。
Now I've been promoted, I can get you a nice house when we're married.

677
01:14:15,535 --> 01:14:17,037
——“结婚”?-是的。
- "Married"? - Yeah.

678
01:14:17,662 --> 01:14:20,915
海滩上漂亮的两层楼，带环绕式阳台。
A nice two-story on the beach with a wraparound veranda.

679
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,251
是的。
Yeah.

680
01:14:26,671 --> 01:14:28,298
你父母呢?
What about your parents?

681
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,841
你告诉他们我的事了吗?
Have you told them about me?

682
01:14:30,550 --> 01:14:35,347
你要了解我的家人如果我说你是我的选择，那就是我的选择。
What you gotta understand about my folks is that if I say you're my choice, that'd be that.

683
01:14:35,972 --> 01:14:38,224
当他们了解你的时候，他们会爱上你的。
They'll fall in love with you when they get to know ya.

684
01:14:42,854 --> 01:14:43,855
到这里来。
Come here.

685
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:56,868
对了，我过几天要开车去阿什维尔给我爸爸的店买些东西。
Oh, by the way, I have to drive over to Asheville in a few days to buy goods for my dad's store.

686
01:14:56,951 --> 01:14:58,787
我想你可以来。
I was thinking you could come.

687
01:14:59,579 --> 01:15:04,834
-庆祝你的书和所有。-哦…-会有很多人。-没关系。
- Celebrate your book and all. - Oh... - There'd be lots of people. - It doesn't matter.

688
01:15:04,918 --> 01:15:06,711
你会和我在一起。我知道一切。
You'd be with me. I know everything.

689
01:15:07,504 --> 01:15:10,256
如果你不想跟一个人说话，你可以不跟他说话。
Hell, you don't have to talk to one soul if you don't want to.

690
01:15:11,132 --> 01:15:14,469
来吧。如果我们要结婚，你得多出去走走。
Come on. If we're gonna get married, you need to get out in the world a bit.

691
01:15:15,637 --> 01:15:17,639
展开你的长翅膀。
Spread those long wings of yours.

692
01:15:20,058 --> 01:15:21,601
来吧。它会很有趣。
Come on. It'll be fun.

693
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:33,446
这是两天的工作，所以我们今晚留下来。
It's a two-day job, so we'll stay the night.

Hey, you don't have to prove yourself to anyone. You understand?

709
01:18:20,738 --> 01:18:22,407
你有我，我爱你。
You have me, and I love you.

710
01:18:26,244 --> 01:18:27,495
我给你做了点东西。
I made you something.

711
01:18:38,172 --> 01:18:39,173
哦。
Oh.

712
01:18:42,427 --> 01:18:47,932
它只是一个贝壳，挂在一片生牛皮上，打了个紧紧的结，现在不见了。
It was a single shell, hung on a piece of rawhide, tied in a tight knot, and it was missing.

713
01:18:48,016 --> 01:19:00,486
澄清一下，你的意思是切斯每天戴的贝壳项链在他被发现的那天执法人员从他身上找到的东西里不见了。
So to be clear, what you're saying is that the shell necklace that Chase wore every day was missing from these items that law enforcement recovered from his body the day that he was found.

714
01:19:00,987 --> 01:19:02,238
是这样吗?
Is that correct?

715
01:19:02,322 --> 01:19:04,699
-我认为这很重要。——是的。
- I think it's important. - Yes.

716
01:19:05,450 --> 01:19:08,703
那天晚上他和我们一起吃饭的时候戴着那条项链。
He had that necklace on when he had dinner with us that night.

717
01:19:09,996 --> 01:19:12,790
它从他的身体里消失了。
And it was gone from his body.

718
01:19:14,208 --> 01:19:16,210
我想说的是他从来没有把它取下来。
And what I'm saying is he never took it off.

719
01:19:16,711 --> 01:19:18,755
杀他的人拿走了。
Whoever killed him took it.

720
01:19:18,838 --> 01:19:21,966
反对，法官大人，这是推测
Objection, Your Honor. It's speculation.

721
01:19:22,050 --> 01:19:23,176
反对有效
Sustained.

722
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:29,057
陪审团的女士们先生们，请忽略安德鲁斯夫人的最后一句话。
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you will disregard that last remark by Mrs. Andrews.

723
01:19:29,140 --> 01:19:33,603
安德鲁斯夫人，切斯这条项链是哪来的?
Mrs. Andrews, where did Chase get this necklace?

724
01:19:33,686 --> 01:19:37,398
是那个女孩寄来的。克拉克小姐。
It's from that Marsh Girl. Miss Clark.

725
01:19:38,066 --> 01:19:40,944
我甚至不知道她的名字，也不知道她有没有名字。
I didn't even know her name or if she even had one.

726
01:19:42,403 --> 01:19:51,204
我不明白为什么蔡斯…但我想说的是，她是唯一一个有兴趣拿走那东西的人。
I can't see why Chase... But what I'm saying is, she's the only one who'd have any interest in taking the thing.

727
01:19:51,287 --> 01:19:52,830
安德鲁太太……
Mrs. Andrews...

728
01:19:55,083 --> 01:19:58,002
蔡斯和克拉克小姐是恋人吗?
were Chase and Miss Clark romantically involved?

729
01:19:58,086 --> 01:20:01,047
你可能会说。我看见他晚上偷偷溜出去。
You could say. I saw him sneaking out at night.

730
01:20:01,714 --> 01:20:04,968
当我最后问他要去哪里时，他告诉了我真相。
When I finally asked him where he was going, he told me the truth.

731
01:20:06,177 --> 01:20:08,888
我想:人们会怎么说?
I thought: What would people say?

732
01:20:10,348 --> 01:20:13,893
我是个愚蠢的女人，担心这个，旁边……
I was a silly woman to be worried about that next to...

733
01:20:19,607 --> 01:20:23,194
但他告诉我他和她分手了。
But he told me he broke it off with her.

734
01:20:24,070 --> 01:20:30,284
她知道她不能再拥有他了，所以她杀了他——并拿回了她丑陋的项链!-反对，法官大人
She knew she couldn't have him anymore, so she killed him - and took back her ugly necklace! - Objection, Your Honor.

735
01:20:33,871 --> 01:20:34,706
反对有效
Sustained.

736
01:20:34,789 --> 01:20:36,541
没有问题了，法官大人
No further questions, Your Honor.

737
01:20:40,253 --> 01:20:44,298
安德鲁斯夫人，我对您的损失深表同情。
Um, Mrs. Andrews, you have my deepest sympathy for your loss.

738
01:20:44,924 --> 01:20:51,806
恕我直言，你知道克拉克小姐的房子被彻底搜查过。
With all due respect, you are aware that Miss Clark's house was thoroughly searched.

739
01:20:52,765 --> 01:20:56,394
警察并没有在那里找到项链。
And that the police did not find the necklace there.

740
01:20:56,477 --> 01:20:58,896
——他们是吗?——没有。
- Did they? - No.

741
01:21:21,169 --> 01:21:22,170
嘿。
Hey.

742
01:21:23,087 --> 01:21:24,464
-我知道了。-嗨。
- I got it. - Hey.

743
01:21:25,298 --> 01:21:27,967
-差点就抓到你了-差点把我打晕。
- Almost got you. - Almost knocked me out.

744
01:21:28,051 --> 01:21:30,011
只是想炫耀一下。
Just trying to show off.

745
01:21:31,679 --> 01:21:34,348
那个女孩在床上是什么样子的，伙计?她是动物吗?
What's that Marsh Girl like in bed, man? Is she an animal?

746
01:21:34,432 --> 01:21:37,143
像山猫一样狂野，很值油钱。
Wild as a bobcat and worth every bit of the gas money.

747
01:21:37,685 --> 01:21:39,020
告诉我她的眼睛在发光。
Tell me her eyes glow.

748
01:21:39,145 --> 01:21:42,265
-只对我来说，而且只在我做的时候。-嘿，别这么说她。
- Only for me and only when I make them. - Hey, don't talk about her like that.

749
01:21:43,858 --> 01:21:46,736
——那是什么?-我说了不要那样说她。
- What's that? - I said don't talk about her like that.

750
01:21:46,819 --> 01:21:48,613
哦，那个大学生。
Oh, the college boy.

751
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:53,326
-他教沼泽女孩识字。——哦。
- He taught the Marsh Girl her ABCs. - Oh.

752
01:21:53,409 --> 01:21:55,203
——嗯。-你在浪费她的时间。
- Mmm. - You're a waste of her time.

753
01:21:57,205 --> 01:21:59,373
去吧，大学生。你打算怎么办?
Go ahead, college boy. What you gonna do?

754
01:21:59,457 --> 01:22:02,710
-拜托，你很坚强，对吧?-来吧，我们做点什么。
- Come on, you're tough, right? - Come on, let's do something.

755
01:22:02,794 --> 01:22:06,089
-你想打我?-嘿，你们现在都安静点。
- You wanna hit me? - Hey, y'all settle down now.

756
01:22:06,172 --> 01:22:07,173
这就够了。
That's enough.

757
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:11,427
在有人受伤之前安定下来。
Settle down before someone get hurt.

758
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:13,721
有比这更好的方法。
There's better ways than this.

759
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:35,118
嘿,Kya。
Hey, Kya.

760
01:22:38,079 --> 01:22:39,079
嘿，搞什么鬼?
Hey, what the hell?

761
01:22:39,831 --> 01:22:41,999
等等!Kya,等等!拜托。
Wait! Kya, wait! Please.

762
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:43,167
听着，我只是想谈谈。
Look, I just wanna talk.

763
01:22:43,251 --> 01:22:45,128
滚出我的泻湖，你这个肮脏的怪物!
Get out of my lagoon, you dirty creep!

764
01:22:45,211 --> 01:22:47,046
请Kya !我只是想和你谈谈!
Kya, please! I just need to talk to you!

765
01:22:47,130 --> 01:22:48,756
我不在乎你想要什么!
I don't care what you want!

766
01:22:49,465 --> 01:22:52,051
我再也不想见到你。永远。
I never wanna see you again. Ever.

767
01:22:52,135 --> 01:22:54,053
吉娅，我得跟你谈谈蔡斯，好吗?
Kya, I need to talk to you about Chase, okay?

768
01:22:54,137 --> 01:22:56,889
——追呢?-他配不上你。
- About Chase? - He's not good enough for you.

769
01:22:58,558 --> 01:23:01,352
是你离开我的。
You're the one who left me.

770
01:23:03,187 --> 01:23:06,941
当你答应他的时候，他没有回来。再也没有回来。
Who didn't come back when you promised. Who never came back.

771
01:23:09,485 --> 01:23:13,698
你甚至都没写信解释，也没说你是死是活。
You didn't even write to explain or even to say if you were alive or dead.

772
01:23:13,781 --> 01:23:14,991
你只是消失了。
You just disappeared.

773
01:23:15,074 --> 01:23:18,411
我知道。我很抱歉，Kya，你不知道。
I know. And I'm so sorry, Kya, you have no idea.

774
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:21,914
你没有勇气面对我。
You weren't man enough to face me.

775
01:23:23,166 --> 01:23:24,292
你是对的,Kya。
You're right, Kya.

776
01:23:25,585 --> 01:23:27,211
你说的都是真的。
Everything you say is true.

777
01:23:28,087 --> 01:23:32,341
那样离开你是我做过的最坏的事，是我这辈子做过的最坏的事。
Leaving you like that was the worst thing I've ever done, the worst thing I'll ever do in my life.

778
01:23:33,009 --> 01:23:37,305
我知道我伤你有多深，但我无法面对你，就像你说的。
I knew how badly I'd hurt you, and I couldn't face you, like you said.

779
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:44,645
我还以为你不能离开沼泽，到别的世界去生活呢。
I thought you wouldn't be able to leave the marsh and live in any other world.

780
01:23:45,479 --> 01:23:49,525
我以为我必须在你和其他一切之间做出选择。
You know, I thought I had to choose between you and everything else.

781
01:23:49,609 --> 01:23:55,531
但事实是，吉娅，我认为重要的一切，奖学金，助学金，工作，没有你都毫无意义。
But the truth is, Kya, everything else that I thought mattered, the scholarships, the grants, the jobs, it means nothing without you.

782
01:23:58,159 --> 01:23:59,368
我大错特错
I was so wrong.

783
01:24:00,411 --> 01:24:01,996
多年来我一直很抱歉。
I've been sorry for years.

784
01:24:04,582 --> 01:24:06,834
我会后悔一辈子的。
And I'll be sorry for the rest of my life.

785
01:24:17,803 --> 01:24:18,803
你看起来……
You look...

786
01:24:31,025 --> 01:24:32,443
我给你带了点东西。
I brought you something.

787
01:24:50,253 --> 01:24:53,422
我在镇上的新实验室工作。
You know, I'm working at the new lab near town.

788
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:56,342
你会喜欢的，Kya。
You'd love it, Kya.

789
01:24:56,425 --> 01:24:58,594
我可以在显微镜下研究这一切。
I get to study all this under a microscope.

790
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:03,057
所以我现在在这里。
So I'm here now.

791
01:25:05,476 --> 01:25:06,602
我永远回来了。
I'm back for good.

792
01:25:16,654 --> 01:25:18,698
Kya，我愿意做任何事…
Kya, I would do anything to...

793
01:25:21,867 --> 01:25:24,078
我会做很多不同的事。
I would've done so many things differently.

794
01:25:32,753 --> 01:25:34,672
你现在想要什么，泰特?
What do you want now, Tate?

795
01:25:34,755 --> 01:25:37,508
你能不能原谅我，吉娅?
Is there any way that you could possibly forgive me, Kya?

796
01:25:39,927 --> 01:25:40,927
好吗?
Please?

797
01:25:43,931 --> 01:25:45,308
我不知道该怎么做。
I don't know how.

798
01:26:08,581 --> 01:26:15,338
吉娅，我相信如果你知道还有谁有理由伤害蔡斯·安德鲁斯你会告诉我的。
Kya, I trust you would tell me if you knew of anyone else who had reason to harm Chase Andrews.

799
01:26:20,009 --> 01:26:21,761
好吧，那好吧。
Well, all right, then.

800
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,929
试着休息一下。
Try and get some rest.

801
01:26:30,478 --> 01:26:32,188
哦。嗨。
Oh. Hi.

802
01:26:32,271 --> 01:26:34,398
嘿。你来镇上做什么?
Hey. What you doing in town?

803
01:26:34,482 --> 01:26:38,402
我从出版商那里得到了好消息，所以我想我们可以庆祝一下。
I had some good news from the publisher, so I thought we could celebrate.

804
01:26:38,694 --> 01:26:40,279
-本来要…-他来了。
- Was gonna make... - There he is.

805
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:49,914
Kya，你认识布莱恩，蒂娜，珀尔。
Kya, you know Brian, Tina, Pearl.

806
01:26:50,748 --> 01:26:53,334
-你们认识Kya。-当然，《沼泽女孩》
- You guys know Kya. - Sure, yeah, the Marsh Girl.

807
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:55,753
很高兴认识你，Kya。
Pleased to meet you, Kya.

808
01:26:56,379 --> 01:26:58,214
我追逐的未婚妻。
I'm Chase's fiancée.

809
01:27:00,508 --> 01:27:02,843
好的。好吧，回头见，Kya。
All right. Well, I'll see you around, Kya.

810
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:44,718
Kya !
Kya!

811
01:27:45,886 --> 01:27:47,596
嘿,Kya。我可以解释。
Hey, Kya. I can explain.

812
01:27:50,683 --> 01:27:51,767
你在里面吗?
Are you in there?

813
01:27:53,853 --> 01:27:55,271
嘿，我只是想谈谈。
Hey, I just wanna talk.

814
01:27:56,939 --> 01:27:58,065
Kya !
Kya!

815
01:28:01,569 --> 01:28:02,862
我知道你在这里，该死!
I know you're here, damn it!

816
01:28:08,868 --> 01:28:09,868
Kya !
Kya!

817
01:29:04,632 --> 01:29:06,258
我不得不独自生活。
I had to do life alone.

818
01:29:08,636 --> 01:29:09,720
但我知道。
But I knew that.

819
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:13,057
我早就知道了。
I'd known for a long time.

820
01:29:15,226 --> 01:29:16,435
人们不会留下来
People don't stay.

821
01:29:28,864 --> 01:29:38,415
"亲爱的克拉克小姐，随信附上你那本漂亮的书的最后一版，以及期票，版税还在后面呢，我相信。
"Dear Miss Clark, enclosed is the final copy of your beautiful book, along with the initial check for delivery, with royalties to follow, I'm sure.

822
01:29:39,917 --> 01:29:45,422
我下个月要去格林维尔参加一个会议，希望你能加入我们，庆祝这一伟大的成就。”
I'm attending a conference in Greenville next month and would love for you to join us and celebrate this great accomplishment."

823
01:29:54,181 --> 01:30:02,314
凯瑟琳·丹妮尔·克拉克的完整契约包括310英亩的泻湖，沼泽，橡树林和海滩。
"A full deed for Catherine Danielle Clark for 310 acres of lagoons, marsh, oak forests and beach.

824
01:30:02,898 --> 01:30:05,985
荒地类:阴暗的沼泽。”
Wasteland category: murky swamp."

825
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:28,424
朱迪?
Jodie?

826
01:30:28,507 --> 01:30:31,844
我在阿什维尔，我在一家商店看到了你的书:
There I am in Asheville, and I see your book in a shop:

827
01:30:32,595 --> 01:30:34,054
凯瑟琳克拉克丹尼尔。
Catherine Danielle Clark.

828
01:30:34,138 --> 01:30:38,934
我的心都碎了，一下子高兴得跳了起来。
And my heart just broke and leapt for joy all at once.

829
01:30:39,018 --> 01:30:40,853
我知道我必须找到你。
I knew I had to find you.

830
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:43,480
我只是没想到你还在这里。
I just didn't think you'd still be here.

831
01:30:44,565 --> 01:30:45,899
其他人呢?
What about the others?

832
01:30:46,734 --> 01:30:49,194
我对墨菲，曼迪和米西一无所知。
I don't know a thing about Murph, Mandy or Missy.

833
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:52,239
我在街上碰到他们都认不出来。
I wouldn't know them if I passed them in the street.

834
01:30:52,865 --> 01:30:53,866
,嗯…
And, um...

835
01:30:55,868 --> 01:30:56,952
马呢?
what about Ma?

836
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:01,915
马过去,Kya。
Ma passed, Kya.

837
01:31:10,257 --> 01:31:12,593
妈妈有个妹妹，叫罗斯玛丽。
Ma had a sister, Rosemary.

838
01:31:12,676 --> 01:31:15,554
她在军队里找到我，告诉我发生了什么。
She found me in the Army and told me what happened.

839
01:31:15,638 --> 01:31:18,849
穿着鳄鱼皮鞋出现在罗斯玛丽家门口。
Showed up at Rosemary's door in her alligator shoes.

840
01:31:18,932 --> 01:31:21,560
罗斯玛丽说她几个月没说话了。
Rosemary said she didn't talk for months.

841
01:31:21,644 --> 01:31:24,521
大约一年后，她想起自己有孩子。
And then about a year later, she remembered she had children.

842
01:31:24,605 --> 01:31:28,150
罗斯玛丽帮她写了一封信给爸爸，问她能不能来接我们。
Rosemary helped her write a letter to Pa, asking if she could come get us.

843
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:34,031
他告诉她，如果她再联系我们，他会把我们打得面目全。
And he told her if she ever so much as contacted us again, he'd beat us unrecognizable.

844
01:31:35,532 --> 01:31:37,117
是啊，听起来像爸爸。
Yeah, sounds like Pa.

845
01:31:37,201 --> 01:31:41,872
她攒钱请律师什么的，但后来她病了。
She saved up for lawyers and everything, but then she got sick.

846
01:31:41,955 --> 01:31:42,956
白血病。
Leukemia.

847
01:31:43,874 --> 01:31:46,377
她试过了,但是……她从来没有机会。
She tried, but... She never had a chance.

848
01:31:49,046 --> 01:31:54,093
我一直在等待……这么多年来她一直走在这条小路上。
I've been waiting... all these years for her to walk down the lane.

849
01:31:55,928 --> 01:32:01,642
你这辈子都没有家庭，我做什么都无法让你恢复家庭。
You didn't have a family your whole life, and there's nothing I can do to give you that back.

850
01:32:02,643 --> 01:32:06,397
但我想尽我所能来见你。
But I'd like to come see you as much as I can get up here.

851
01:32:11,527 --> 01:32:12,945
是的，我很乐意。
Yeah, I'd like that.

852
01:32:50,315 --> 01:32:51,942
梅布尔会很自豪的。
Mabel's gonna be so proud.

853
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:53,402
还有一件事。
Just one more thing.

854
01:32:56,071 --> 01:32:57,823
我一定会给他的。
I'll be sure he gets it.

855
01:32:59,158 --> 01:33:00,325
谢谢你,冒险乐园”。
Thank you, Jumpin'.

856
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:06,582
你们过得如何?
How y'all doing?

857
01:33:06,665 --> 01:33:09,501
请给我来一包你们最好的，先生。
One pack of your finest, please, sir.

858
01:33:09,585 --> 01:33:11,086
再给我一些火柴。
And give me some matches.

859
01:33:11,170 --> 01:33:13,172
——确定的事情。——“当然的事情。”
- Sure thing. - "Sure thing."

860
01:33:14,798 --> 01:33:16,383
Kya克拉克。
Kya Clark.

861
01:33:17,009 --> 01:33:18,761
凯瑟琳·丹妮尔·克拉克小姐。
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

862
01:33:18,844 --> 01:33:20,721
你写了一本书。到这里来。
You wrote a damn book. Come here.

863
01:33:20,804 --> 01:33:22,723
等等,等等,等等。我想和你谈谈。
Wait, wait, wait. I wanna talk to you.

864
01:33:22,806 --> 01:33:24,725
别这样。来吧。
Don't act like that. Come on.

865
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:26,769
别打扰我。
Leave me alone.

866
01:33:29,730 --> 01:33:32,441
该死，那个女孩现在觉得你配不上她了。
Damn, the Marsh Girl thinks she's too good for you now.

867
01:33:33,066 --> 01:33:34,067
闭嘴!
Shut up!

868
01:33:34,151 --> 01:33:36,403
给你，先生，这是免费的。
Here you go, sir. It's on the house.

869
01:33:45,871 --> 01:33:47,456
我想我能在这里找到你。
Thought I might find you here.

870
01:33:48,832 --> 01:33:50,209
我叫你离我远点。
I told you to leave me alone.

871
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:53,712
我知道，但我只是…听着，我想说我很抱歉。
No, I know, but I just... Listen, I wanted to say I'm sorry.

872
01:33:53,796 --> 01:33:57,216
真的。我为事情的结果感到难过。
Really. I feel bad about how things turned out.

873
01:33:58,425 --> 01:33:59,885
"结果如何"?
"How things turned out"?

874
01:34:01,345 --> 01:34:05,390
什么，你是说我们在一起的时候你是怎么订婚的吗?
What, you mean how it turned out you were engaged the whole time we were together?

875
01:34:06,433 --> 01:34:10,020
你是怎么骗了所有人的?
How it turned out that you lie to everybody?

876
01:34:10,103 --> 01:34:12,606
Kya，我必须做我不想做的事。你知道的。
Kya, I have to do things I don't wanna do. You know that.

877
01:34:12,689 --> 01:34:15,776
不，我必须嫁给珀尔这样的人。我不得不。
No, I have to get married to someone like Pearl. I had to.

878
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,653
但你才是我真正想要的人。
But you're the one I really want.

879
01:34:21,990 --> 01:34:24,243
你知道其他男人会试图改变你吗?
You know any other man would have tried to change you?

880
01:34:25,035 --> 01:34:26,161
你来解决?
To fix you?

881
01:34:27,496 --> 01:34:28,747
我从来没有。
I never did.

882
01:34:30,249 --> 01:34:33,001
不,不。请,请等待。我需要你。我真的需要你。
No, no. Please, please, wait. I need you. I really need you.

883
01:34:34,586 --> 01:34:36,505
别把我一个人留在那里。
Don't leave me all alone in that place.

884
01:34:37,339 --> 01:34:38,674
你知道，没有其他人认识我。
You know, nobody else knows me.

885
01:34:43,220 --> 01:34:45,055
我为你感到难过。
You know, I feel sorry for you.

886
01:34:47,224 --> 01:34:49,393
但我不想跟这些扯上任何关系。
But I want nothing to do with any of that.

887
01:35:03,615 --> 01:35:04,783
怀尔德。
Wilder than ever.

888
01:35:08,954 --> 01:35:10,455
我知道你也想要这个。
I know you want this too.

889
01:35:10,539 --> 01:35:12,416
——停止!-我知道你也想要这个
- Stop! - I know you want this too.

890
01:35:18,463 --> 01:35:21,341
你是我的,Kya。你属于我。这次我不会让你走的。
You're mine, Kya. You belong to me. I'm not letting you go this time.

891
01:35:42,154 --> 01:35:44,323
离我远点，你这个混蛋!
Leave me alone, you bastard!

892
01:35:45,699 --> 01:35:48,702
你再烦我，我就杀了你!
You bother me again and I'll kill you!

893
01:35:49,494 --> 01:35:51,622
她喊得很大声，先生。
She shouted it real loud, sir.

894
01:35:51,705 --> 01:35:56,960
我听到一阵骚动，我走近一些，看看有没有人有麻烦，她就在那里。
I heard a commotion, and I come closer, see if anybody was in trouble, and there she was.

895
01:35:57,044 --> 01:35:59,004
你认识那个女人吗?
And do you recognize the woman?

896
01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:03,300
她今天在法庭上吗?
Is she in the courtroom today?

897
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:05,677
是的，那边的那个。被告。
Yes, that one there. The defendant.

898
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:08,263
大家都叫她沼泽女孩。
The one folks call Marsh Girl.

899
01:36:13,685 --> 01:36:16,480
我终于明白了为什么马云必须离开。
I finally understood why Ma had to leave.

900
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:27,926
我从爸爸那里学到了一件事，这些人必须要有最后一击。
One thing I learned from Pa, these men have to have the last punch.

901
01:37:55,829 --> 01:37:57,622
被孤立是一回事。
Being isolated was one thing.

902
01:37:58,790 --> 01:38:01,668
生活在恐惧中，完全是另一回事。
Living in fear, quite another.

903
01:38:03,670 --> 01:38:05,589
我永远不会那样生活。
I will never live like that.

904
01:38:06,798 --> 01:38:10,677
一生都在想下一个拳头什么时候会掉下来。
A life wondering when the next fist will fall.

905
01:38:32,699 --> 01:38:33,950
泰特，你不能来这里。
Tate, you can't be here.

906
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:36,036
我只是想来看看你。
I just wanted to check on you.

907
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:38,622
- Jumpin说他自从…,而不是现在。
- Jumpin' said he hadn't seen you since... - Not now.

908
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:41,875
Kya，你的脸怎么了?
Kya, what happened to your face?

909
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:45,170
是追求?告诉我,Kya。是他干的吗?
Was it Chase? Tell me, Kya. Did he do this?

910
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:46,880
我要你别插手。
I need you to stay out of it.

911
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:48,298
那个混蛋。
That son of a bitch.

912
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:51,843
-那个狗娘养的-泰特，你得走了
- That son of a bitch. - Tate, I need you to go.

913
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:53,178
Kya。
Kya.

914
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:01,853
我本来打算下周去格林维尔的。
You know, I was gonna go to Greenville next week.

915
01:39:05,107 --> 01:39:06,733
终于见到我的出版商了。
Finally meet my publishers.

916
01:39:08,944 --> 01:39:10,529
谈论下一本书。
Talk about the next book.

917
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:12,489
我觉得自己足够勇敢。
I was feeling brave enough.

918
01:39:12,989 --> 01:39:14,616
你还是可以去的。
Well, you can still go.

919
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:16,284
像这样吗?
Looking like this?

920
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:18,120
别让他毁了你的大好前程。
Don't let him ruin this for you.

921
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:20,413
去格林维尔。
Go to Greenville.

922
01:39:21,331 --> 01:39:22,916
好吧?有一辆公共汽车。
Okay? There's a bus.

923
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:24,793
很简单。Jumpin有日程表。
It's easy. Jumpin's got the schedule.

924
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:30,382
让他们把你安排在一家不错的酒店里，吃一些不用自己做的餐厅热菜。
Let them put you up in a nice hotel, eat some hot restaurant food you didn't have to make.

925
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,342
如果可以的话，待上一周。
Stay a week, if you can.

926
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:36,221
等你回来我就去看你。好吗?
And I'll come see you when you're back. Okay?

927
01:39:37,264 --> 01:39:39,057
听听出版商是怎么说的。
Hear how it all went with the publishers.

928
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,017
好吧。
All right.

929
01:39:48,525 --> 01:39:49,526
嘿,你冷吗?
Hey, you cold?

930
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:54,281
我很好。我不需要你照顾我。
I'm fine. I don't need you to take care of me.

931
01:39:54,364 --> 01:39:56,241
我知道，拿着我的帽子。
I know, but just take my hat.

932
01:39:56,867 --> 01:39:58,994
-我说了我不需要你的帮助。-拿去吧。
- I said I don't need your help. - Just take it.

933
01:40:27,856 --> 01:40:30,400
能告诉我你的眼睛怎么了吗?
You wanna tell me what happened to your eye?

934
01:40:31,735 --> 01:40:33,820
我需要记下公共汽车时刻表。
I need to write down the bus schedule.

935
01:40:33,904 --> 01:40:35,405
你有副本，对吧?
You have a copy, right?

936
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:43,663
是那个奇斯，对吧?
It was that Chase, wasn't it?

937
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,626
Kya，看着我。
Kya, look at me.

938
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:52,547
现在你告诉我他做了什么。
Now you tell me what he did.

939
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:56,092
我不能说。
I can't say it.

940
01:40:57,719 --> 01:40:58,803
现在一切都结束了。
It's over now.

941
01:40:59,596 --> 01:41:01,389
我只想让它从我的生活中消失。
I just want it out of my life.

942
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:03,725
你怎么知道他不会再来找你?
And how you know he ain't coming after you again?

943
01:41:05,018 --> 01:41:07,729
-你一个人在外面。请——冒险乐园”。
- You're all by your lonesome out there. - Jumpin', please.

944
01:41:09,022 --> 01:41:10,815
你不能告诉任何人。
You can't tell anybody.

945
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:12,651
你知道的。
You know how it is.

946
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:17,948
他们会把我拖到警长办公室让我向一群人描述。
They'd drag me into the sheriff's office and make me describe it to a bunch of men.

947
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:22,619
然后在报纸上报道我，指控我嫖娼。
And then write me up in the papers, accusing me of whoring.

948
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,789
或是想从父母那里要钱。
Or trying to get money out of his parents.

949
01:41:26,665 --> 01:41:28,333
好吧?他们什么也不会做。
Okay? They'd do nothing about it.

950
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:29,459
你是对的,Kya。
You're right, Kya.

951
01:41:32,045 --> 01:41:34,506
我不会做任何让事情变得更糟的事。
And I ain't gonna do anything to make this thing worse.

952
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:40,011
但是你要来的时候要告诉我。
But you let me know when you're coming and going.

953
01:41:40,095 --> 01:41:41,137
你听说了吗?
You hear?

954
01:41:41,972 --> 01:41:43,848
我得知道你是不是出城了。
I gotta know if you're out of town.

955
01:41:47,269 --> 01:41:50,438
因为如果我有一段时间见不到你
'Cause if I don't see you for a while...

956
01:41:55,819 --> 01:41:57,153
谢谢你,冒险乐园”。
Thank you, Jumpin'.

957
01:41:58,238 --> 01:41:59,906
我过几天就要走了。
I'm leaving in a few days.

958
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:03,243
我一回来就来看你。
I'll come see you as soon as I'm back.

959
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:06,663
好吧,这很好。
Okay, that's good.

960
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:08,623
这很好。
That's good.

961
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:16,840
普赖斯小姐，你能告诉我们10月29日早上你看到了什么吗?
Miss Price, would you tell us what you saw on the morning of October 29?

962
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:20,635
我看到了沼泽女孩……就是克拉克小姐。原谅我。
I saw the Marsh Girl... Miss Clark, that is. Pardon me.

963
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,763
-…上9点的公共汽车。-你的记性真好。
- ...get on the 9:00 bus. - You've got quite a good memory.

964
01:42:23,847 --> 01:42:24,889
我们都谈论过这件事。
We all talked about it.

965
01:42:24,973 --> 01:42:27,434
我们从没见过她被清理得那么干净。
We'd never seen her all cleaned up like that.

966
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:28,852
头发梳得一丝不苟,化妆。
Hair combed, makeup.

967
01:42:29,686 --> 01:42:40,822
澄清一下，10月29日早上，你和其他几个人看到克拉克小姐上了早上9点的巴士离开了巴克利湾。
Just to be clear, on the morning of October 29, you and several others saw Miss Clark board the 9 a.m. bus and leave Barkley Cove.

968
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,866
-是的，没错。-谢谢你，普莱斯小姐。
- Yes, that's right. - Thank you, Miss Price.

969
01:42:42,949 --> 01:42:44,576
没有问题了，法官大人
No further questions, Your Honor.

970
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:49,164
普赖斯小姐，Piggly Wiggly是凌晨一点半开门吗?
Miss Price, is the Piggly Wiggly open at 1:30 in the morning?

971
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:50,957
没有,先生。
No, sir.

972
01:42:52,042 --> 01:43:04,304
我这么问的原因是，你不可能看到谁从格林维尔下了夜班大巴，也不可能看到谁坐上了凌晨两点半从巴克利湾回格林维尔的大巴，对吗?
Well, the reason I ask is, you couldn't have seen who got off the night bus from Greenville, nor could you have seen who got on the 2:30 a.m. bus from Barkley Cove back to Greenville, could you?

973
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,056
嗯,没有。当然不是。
Well, no. Of course not.

974
01:43:06,139 --> 01:43:19,527
你看到克拉克小姐登上去格林维尔的早班车后她可以在那天晚上回到巴克利湾，回到格林维尔吃早餐，而不被你发现。
So after you saw Miss Clark board that morning bus to Greenville... she could have returned to Barkley Cove that night and been back in Greenville for breakfast, all without you taking notice.

975
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,821
我叫罗伯特·福斯特。
My name is Robert Foster.

976
01:43:21,905 --> 01:43:26,284
我是马萨诸塞州波士顿市哈里森·莫里斯出版公司的高级编辑。
I'm a senior editor at Harrison Morris Publishing Company in Boston, Massachusetts.

977
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:32,791
福斯特先生，10月29日晚上7点，你和克拉克小姐共进晚餐。
Mr. Foster, you sat down for dinner with Miss Clark at 7 p.m. on the night of October 29.

978
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:34,125
——对吗?——是的。
- Correct? - Yes.

979
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:36,252
你对她的第一印象是什么?
What was your first impression of her?

980
01:43:37,754 --> 01:43:43,385
我的第一印象是，她非常害羞，非常温柔，非常聪明。
My first impression was, uh, that she was very shy, very gentle, very smart.

981
01:43:44,344 --> 01:43:49,099
我知道她是一个隐士，但我也知道她是一个天才的博物学家。
I knew that she was something of a recluse, but I also knew that she was a gifted naturalist.

982
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:52,143
-晚餐持续了多久?-至少几个小时。
- How long did that dinner go on? - At least a few hours.

983
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:53,937
有些雌性昆虫确实会吃掉它们的配偶。
Some female insects do eat their mates.

984
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,815
事实上，萤火虫有两种不同的光信号。
Fireflies, in fact, have two different light signals.

985
01:43:57,315 --> 01:44:01,528
一只用来交配，一只用来吸引雄性，让它成为自己的下一餐。
One for mating, and one to attract a male in order to make him her next meal.

986
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:03,363
-所以她吃了他?——多么可怕。
- So she eats him? - How gruesome.

987
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:06,116
——哦,亲爱的。-我必须少和昆虫呆在一起。
- Oh, dear. - I must spend less time with insects.

988
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:08,535
-这是不道德的。——不道德的。
- It's quite amoral. - Amoral, indeed.

989
01:44:08,618 --> 01:44:10,954
我不知道大自然是否有黑暗的一面。
I don't know if there is a dark side to nature.

990
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:14,499
只有创造性的方式来忍受。
Just inventive ways to endure.

991
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:16,876
尽管困难重重。
Against all odds.

992
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:25,593
第二天早上，10月30日，你和克拉克小姐见面时，她的外表或举止有什么不寻常之处吗?
And when you met with Miss Clark the following morning, October 30th, was there anything unusual about her appearance or her demeanor?

993
01:44:25,677 --> 01:44:26,845
完全没有
Not at all.

994
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,139
没有问题了，法官大人
No further questions, Your Honor.

995
01:44:29,222 --> 01:44:34,394
福斯特先生，克拉克小姐和你和你的同事住在同一家酒店吗?
Mr. Foster, did Miss Clark stay at the same hotel as you and your colleagues?

996
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:37,105
不。她喜欢小一点的旅馆。
No. She preferred a smaller hotel.

997
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:39,732
山什么的。
The, uh, Mountain something.

998
01:44:39,816 --> 01:44:43,069
你能帮我看一下这张格林维尔的地图吗?
Could you look at this map of Greenville for me, please?

999
01:44:43,153 --> 01:44:51,828
我想你会看到皮埃蒙特，你和你的同事住过的地方，然后是克拉克小姐住过的三山酒店。
I think you'll see The Piedmont, where you and your colleagues stayed, and then The Three Mountains Hotel, where Miss Clark stayed.

1000
01:44:51,911 --> 01:44:55,415
你能告诉我哪一家离汽车站最近吗?
Could you tell me which one is closest to the bus station?

1001
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:59,502
三山饭店比较近。
The Three Mountains Hotel is closer.

1002
01:44:59,586 --> 01:45:05,508
事实上，三山酒店是离格林维尔汽车站最近的酒店。对吗?
In fact, The Three Mountains is the closest hotel to the Greenville bus station. Is that correct?

1003
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:07,927
看起来是这样
Looks that way.

1004
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:10,430
没有问题了
No further questions.

1005
01:45:10,513 --> 01:45:15,685
我觉得一个好律师不会让自己的当事人出庭作证，但这可能对你有帮助。
I don't think a good lawyer ever puts their client on the stand, but this might help you.

1006
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:20,690
让陪审团能直接听到你的声音。
For the jury to be able to hear from you, directly.

1007
01:45:21,941 --> 01:45:28,990
为了让他们能够看到你……做一个真正善良体贴的人。
For them to be able to see you... as the kind and thoughtful person you truly are.

1008
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:30,700
他们永远不会看到那样的我。
They're never gonna see me like that.

1009
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:35,705
听。我知道你有一大堆理由恨这些人…不，我从不讨厌他们。
Listen. I know you have a world of reasons to hate these people... No, I never hated them.

1010
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:37,290
他们恨我。
They hated me.

1011
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:41,794
他们嘲笑我。他们离开我。
They laughed at me. They left me.

1012
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:44,756
他们骚扰我。他们袭击了我。
They harassed me. They attacked me.

1013
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:47,717
你……你想让我求你饶我一命吗?
You... You want me to beg for my life?

1014
01:45:48,885 --> 01:45:50,094
我没有这个能力。
I don't have it in me.

1015
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,721
我不会的。
I won't.

1016
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:56,142
我不会出卖自己的。
I will not offer myself up.

1017
01:45:56,226 --> 01:45:57,685
他们可以自己做决定。
They can make their decision.

1018
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:03,900
但他们并没有对我做出任何决定。
But they're not deciding anything about me.

1019
01:46:05,902 --> 01:46:06,903
这是他们。
It's them.

1020
01:46:08,821 --> 01:46:10,281
他们判断自己。
They're judging themselves.

1021
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:14,160
好吧,。
All right, then.

1022
01:46:21,543 --> 01:46:24,712
弥尔顿先生，你一直对我很好。
Mr. Milton, you have always been kind to me.

1023
01:46:26,214 --> 01:46:27,465
甚至在孩提时代。
Even as a child.

1024
01:46:29,259 --> 01:46:30,468
我永远不会忘记。
I never forgot.

1025
01:46:40,645 --> 01:46:47,652
他的生命被那个被抛弃的情人缩短了，他无法接受他又回到了家庭。
His life was cut short by the jilted lover who could not accept that he had returned to the fold.

1026
01:46:48,194 --> 01:46:52,657
有目击者看到克拉克小姐和蔡斯在沼泽里。
A witness saw Miss Clark and Chase in the marsh.

1027
01:46:52,740 --> 01:46:55,493
听到她说"我要杀了你"
Heard her say the words "I'll kill you."

1028
01:46:56,077 --> 01:47:01,791
更重要的是，那晚有物证将他们联系在一起。
And what's more, is there's physical evidence from that night connecting them.

1029
01:47:02,500 --> 01:47:07,839
她红色羊毛帽子上的纤维留在了他的牛仔夹克上。
Fibers from her red wool cap left on his denim jacket.

1030
01:47:07,922 --> 01:47:09,465
爸爸，我要过去处理这件事。
Dad, I'm going over to deal with it.

1031
01:47:09,549 --> 01:47:12,510
还有谁有动机拿走那条贝壳项链?
Who else would have motive to take that shell necklace?

1032
01:47:14,512 --> 01:47:21,686
你可以，也必须，判定被告犯有一级谋杀罪。
You can, and you must, find that the defendant is guilty of first-degree murder.

1033
01:47:31,487 --> 01:47:32,614
弥尔顿先生。
Mr. Milton.

1034
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:52,592
我一直住在巴克利湾。
I have lived in Barkley Cove my whole life.

1035
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:59,766
和你一样，我也听过关于沼泽女孩的荒诞故事。
And like you, I heard the tall tales told about the Marsh Girl.

1036
01:48:00,308 --> 01:48:02,602
她有狼的血统。
That she was part wolf.

1037
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:06,356
猿类和人类之间缺失的一环。
A missing link between ape and man.

1038
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:09,317
她的眼睛在黑暗中发光。
That her eyes glowed in the dark.

1039
01:48:11,069 --> 01:48:13,780
她来了。
Well, here she is.

1040
01:48:14,656 --> 01:48:18,576
事实是她是个被遗弃的孩子。
The reality is that she was an abandoned child.

1041
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:25,875
一个小女孩独自活在沼泽里，被人唾弃。
A little girl surviving out there in the marsh on her own, reviled and shunned.

1042
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:34,592
詹姆斯·麦迪逊先生和他的妻子梅布尔，他们今天坐在法庭上。
Mr. James Madison and his wife, Mabel, they are sitting here in the courtroom today.

1043
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:38,596
他们是镇上唯一关心过她的人。
They're about the only people in this town who showed her any care.

1044
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:40,056
我们其他人……
The rest of us...

1045
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:51,150
我很惭愧地说，我们给她贴上标签并拒绝了她，因为我们认为她与众不同。
Well, I'm ashamed to say that we labeled her and rejected her because we thought she was different.

1046
01:48:51,859 --> 01:49:01,494
而现在……评判这个害羞又被拒绝的年轻女人的重任落在了你的肩上。
And now... the job of judging this shy and rejected young woman has fallen on your shoulders.

1047
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:13,172
但你必须根据法庭上的事实做出判断，而不是根据过去25年的谣言和感情。
But you must base your judgment on the facts presented in this courtroom, and not on the rumors and feelings from the past 25 years.

1048
01:49:13,256 --> 01:49:16,175
克拉克小姐有可靠的不在场证明。
Miss Clark has a solid alibi.

1049
01:49:16,259 --> 01:49:19,595
蔡斯·安德鲁斯死的那晚她在格林维尔。
She was in Greenville the night Chase Andrews died.

1050
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:24,517
到底有什么事实对她不利?
And what facts, exactly, stand against her?

1051
01:49:26,352 --> 01:49:34,485
政府还没能证明这是一起谋杀，而不仅仅是一场悲剧。
The State has not proven that this incident was indeed a murder, and not just some tragic accident.

1052
01:49:35,528 --> 01:49:54,630
控方想让你们相信，晚上11点半，在没有任何证人看到她的情况下，她坐上了从格林维尔到巴克利湾的最后一班车，并伪装了自己，因为那晚的巴士司机都没能认出她是乘客，一直开回巴克利湾。
The State wants you to believe that at 11:30 at night, without a single witness seeing her, she caught the last bus from Greenville to Barkley Cove, and rode that bus disguised,since neither of the bus drivers that night could identify her as a passenger, all the way back to Barkley Cove.

1053
01:49:54,714 --> 01:50:12,732
然后，不到一个小时…她在半夜追踪蔡斯·安德鲁斯，把他骗到高塔，杀了他，抹掉了所有物证，然后不知怎么搭上了凌晨两点半的巴士回格林维尔。
And then, in less than an hour... she tracks down Chase Andrews in the middle of the night, lures him to the tower, murders him, wipes away all physical evidence,and somehow catches the 2:30 a.m. bus back to Greenville.

1054
01:50:12,815 --> 01:50:15,318
又一次，没有一个目击者看到她。
Again, without a single witness seeing her.

1055
01:50:15,401 --> 01:50:23,034
做完这一切之后，第二天早上，她平静地会见了她的出版商。
And after doing all that, she meets with her publishers the next morning, unruffled.

1056
01:50:23,117 --> 01:50:25,036
这些都不是事实。
Now, these are not facts.

1057
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:34,253
这些只是我们一直在散播的关于克拉克小姐一生的谣言和无稽之谈。
These are just more of the rumors and tall tales that we have been spreading about Miss Clark her entire life.

1058
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:42,512
我相信你会根据事实，而不是你多年来听到的流言蜚语来做出判断。
I believe you will come to a judgment based on the facts, and not the gossip that you have heard for years.

1059
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:51,020
终于到了我们大家公平对待沼泽女孩的时候了。
It's time, at last, for all of us to be fair to the Marsh Girl.

1060
01:50:53,231 --> 01:50:55,483
也许你该回家在那等着。
Maybe you should go home and do your waiting there.

1061
01:50:55,566 --> 01:50:58,152
六个小时了。你觉得他们要花多长时间?
Six hours already. How long do you think they'll take?

1062
01:50:58,236 --> 01:51:00,613
好吧，希望他们能花上一段时间。
Well, let's hope they take a good long while.

1063
01:51:00,696 --> 01:51:04,575
如果有几个陪审员有疑问，我们就有机会。
If a few jurors have doubts, we got a chance.

1064
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:22,677
福尔曼先生，陪审团已经做出了裁决，对吗?
Mr. Foreman, is it correct that the jury has reached a verdict?

1065
01:51:23,177 --> 01:51:24,387
是的，法官大人
We have, Your Honor.

1066
01:51:38,609 --> 01:51:42,530
请被告起立，听候宣判。
The defendant will please rise for the reading of the verdict.

1067
01:51:47,618 --> 01:51:48,619
站起来。
Stand up.

1068
01:51:58,588 --> 01:52:09,599
“我们陪审团认为，被告凯瑟琳·丹妮尔·克拉克……对蔡斯·安德鲁斯先生的一级谋杀罪名不成立"
"We, the jury, find the defendant, Catherine Danielle Clark... not guilty of first-degree murder of Mr. Chase Andrews."

1069
01:52:15,897 --> 01:52:18,274
克拉克小姐，你可以走了。
Miss Clark, you are free to go.

1070
01:52:18,357 --> 01:52:22,278
我代表州政府为你服刑的时间表示歉意
And I apologize, on behalf of the State, for the time that you have served.

1071
01:52:22,361 --> 01:52:24,113
本庭解散
This court is dismissed.

1072
01:52:28,367 --> 01:52:29,368
谢谢你！
Thank you.

1073
01:52:35,499 --> 01:52:36,500
过来
Come here.

1074
01:52:39,045 --> 01:52:41,672
你没事了
You're okay. You're all right.

1075
01:52:43,382 --> 01:52:46,719
你别管这些废话了。我们期待着下一本书的出版。
You just forget about this nonsense. We're looking forward to the next book.

1076
01:53:02,026 --> 01:53:03,361
你能带我回家吗?
Can you take me home?

1077
01:53:51,742 --> 01:53:53,703
现在我终于可以承认了。
Now I can finally admit.

1078
01:53:54,829 --> 01:54:07,383
在与世隔绝的几个月里，我渴望回到沼泽，因为我知道还有多少东西有待探索，有多少生活有待野外探索，这让我坚持下去。
All the months in isolation, yearning to be back in the marsh, it was knowing how much was left to explore, how much life to uncover in the wild, that kept me going.

1079
01:54:09,635 --> 01:54:16,642
还有希望，永远是那个希望……有一天我可以分享它…
And the hope, always that hope... that one day I could share it...

1080
01:54:19,020 --> 01:54:21,856
和我唯一真正爱过的人
with the only person I had ever truly loved.

1081
01:54:52,511 --> 01:54:53,596
Kya!

1082
01:54:55,139 --> 01:54:56,139
Kya.

1083
01:55:13,657 --> 01:55:15,034
你知道我爱你，对吧?
You know I love you, right?

1084
01:56:19,723 --> 01:56:20,723
什么?
What?

1085
01:56:21,433 --> 01:56:24,270
你会…?对不起。我很抱歉。
Will you, uh...? Sorry. I'm sorry.

1086
01:56:27,064 --> 01:56:28,232
你愿意嫁给我吗?
Will you marry me?

1087
01:56:29,900 --> 01:56:31,152
我是说，你想吗?
I mean, do you want to?

1088
01:56:34,864 --> 01:56:36,282
我们不是已经这样了吗?
Well, aren't we already?

1089
01:56:38,033 --> 01:56:39,034
像鹅一样?
Like geese?

1090
01:56:42,163 --> 01:56:43,831
我想我可以接受。
I can live with that, I guess.

1091
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:47,501
过来
Come here.

1092
01:56:59,638 --> 01:57:01,640
哦，又来了。
Oh, here we go.

1093
01:57:01,724 --> 01:57:02,641
嘿。
Hey.

1094
01:57:02,725 --> 01:57:04,768
你好，你好
Hey, you. Hi, there.

1095
01:57:10,816 --> 01:57:12,443
过来，宝贝女儿。
Come here, baby girl.

1096
01:57:14,445 --> 01:57:16,488
他是那么爱你。
He loved you so much.

1097
01:57:26,957 --> 01:57:28,876
Kya。看看这个。
Kya. Look at that.

1098
01:57:28,959 --> 01:57:31,545
看到了吗?在树枝的肘部?
You see that up there? On the elbow of that branch?

1099
01:57:33,589 --> 01:57:35,799
我们上次见到它是什么时候?
When's the last time we saw one of those?

1100
01:57:36,884 --> 01:57:37,885
我知道。
I know.

1101
01:57:42,348 --> 01:57:45,392
这本书很好。这家伙还在说…
This book's pretty good. This guy's still talking about...

1102
01:57:59,490 --> 01:58:04,703
我希望当我要离开的时候，我会快速而轻松地离开，不制造太多的噪音。
I hope when it is time for me to leave, I will go quick and easy, without making too much noise.

1103
01:58:25,641 --> 01:58:26,642
妈!
Ma!

1104
01:58:27,351 --> 01:58:28,352
妈
Ma.

1105
01:58:33,482 --> 01:58:34,482
妈
Ma.

1106
01:58:36,277 --> 01:58:37,277
Kya?

1107
01:58:37,945 --> 01:58:38,946
Kya!

1108
01:59:17,026 --> 01:59:22,448
成为事物自然顺序的一部分总是足够的。
It has always been enough... to be part of the natural sequence of things.

1109
01:59:23,866 --> 01:59:25,159
就像潮汐一样。
Sure as the tides.

1110
01:59:25,993 --> 01:59:27,369
大自然是我的向导
Nature my guide.

1111
01:59:31,999 --> 01:59:34,043
沼泽知道死亡的一切……
The marsh knows all about death...

1112
01:59:37,046 --> 01:59:39,673
也不一定把它定义为悲剧。
and doesn't necessarily define it as tragedy.

1113
01:59:40,841 --> 01:59:42,259
当然不是罪。
Certainly not a sin.

1114
01:59:44,011 --> 01:59:48,057
它明白每一种生物为了生存都做了它必须做的事。
It understands that every creature does what it must to survive.

1115
01:59:50,726 --> 01:59:56,857
有时，为了猎物的生存…它的捕食者必须死。
And that sometimes, for prey to live... its predator must die.

1116
02:00:25,135 --> 02:00:26,470
我现在就是沼泽。
I am the marsh now.

1117
02:00:28,555 --> 02:00:30,140
我是白鹭的羽毛。
I am the feather of an egret.

1118
02:00:31,433 --> 02:00:33,936
我是被冲刷上岸的每一个贝壳。
I am every shell washed upon the shore.

1119
02:00:37,731 --> 02:00:39,108
我是一只萤火虫。
I am a firefly.

1120
02:00:40,150 --> 02:00:43,612
你会看到数以百计的人在黑暗的沼泽深处招手。
You'll see hundreds beckoning far into the dark reaches of the marsh.

1121
02:00:44,738 --> 02:00:46,782
你总能在那里找到我。
And that's where you will always find me.

1122
02:00:47,991 --> 02:00:49,243
就在那边。
Way out yonder.

1123
02:00:49,952 --> 02:00:51,412
小龙虾唱歌的地方。
Where the crawdads sing.
