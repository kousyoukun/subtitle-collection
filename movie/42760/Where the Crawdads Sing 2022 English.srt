[doctor] Time of death,
between midnight and 2 a.m.

23
00:04:15,589 --> 00:04:19,510
Cause of death,
sudden impact from the 63-foot drop.

24
00:04:20,094 --> 00:04:23,681
Since you found that blood
and hair on the support beam,

25
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:27,601
I would deduce that was
the cause of the primary injury.

26
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:32,648
Laymen's terms, he banged
the back of his head on the way down.

27
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,525
To hit the back of his head on the beam,

28
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,861
he would've needed
to fall backwards, is that right?

29
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:40,072
-I'd say yes.
-So he might have been pushed.

There's no fingerprints on the railing,
the grates, nothing.

No fingerprints? Not from Chase either?

32
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,790
No fingerprints, no tracks.

33

Wool, it says.
That could be a sweater, scarf.

37

That's none of my business anymore.

-Fair enough.
-Could've been that woman in the marsh.

49

She's crazy enough for the loony bin.
I bet she'd be up to something like this.

50
00:05:40,257 --> 00:05:42,843
My brother's told me
that Marsh Girl's the missing link.

51

something going on down in that marsh.

Thank you, Mr. Frazier.

You probably know that you're being held
for the murder of Chase Andrews.

00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:52,509
And I have taken the liberty of putting
myself forward to defend you.

00:09:52,593 --> 00:09:54,970
I know you've never been
in trouble before,

86
00:09:55,053 --> 00:10:00,392
so I can explain the courtroom
and the trial and who is who and whatnot.

Uh, do you have family
that you might want to come be with you?

Miss Clark, I don't quite know
how to put this, but, uh...

Well, I know you
as Catherine Danielle Clark,

90
00:10:25,793 --> 00:10:29,588
but here in Barkley Cove
they don't call you by that name.

91

They call you Marsh Girl.

92

And when you stand trial,

93
00:10:35,344 --> 00:10:38,013
you will be judged by a jury of your peers

94
00:10:38,096 --> 00:10:41,183
from Barkley Cove,
who only know you as such.

They are going to judge you
whether they know you or not.

[judge] Catherine Danielle Clark,
of Barkley County, North Carolina,

320
00:29:28,225 --> 00:29:30,770
is charged with the murder
in the first degree

321
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:33,397
of Chase Lawrence Andrews,

322

formerly of Barkley Cove.

323
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:39,612
In such cases, the State is allowed
to seek the death penalty.

it will do so

330

There is an option.
It's what's called a plea bargain.

331
00:30:00,049 --> 00:30:03,552
And it means
that if you are willing to say

332
00:30:03,636 --> 00:30:08,599
that you did go to the tower that night
and met Chase Andrews there

333
00:30:09,308 --> 00:30:13,980

Mr. Milton, I won't say anything
that implies guilt.

on October 30th...

347
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:54,186
the defendant lured Chase Andrews
to the tower and pushed him to his death.

348
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:56,564
She then covered up her tracks
and fingerprints.

349

Now, you're gonna hear she had the time,
she had the motivation,

350
00:30:59,984 --> 00:31:01,652
but most importantly...

351
00:31:04,071 --> 00:31:08,242
she has the weakness of character
to murder Chase Andrews.

353

Ladies and gentlemen, the State is going
to throw a lot of words at you

354
00:31:19,336 --> 00:31:22,381
about Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

355
00:31:23,841 --> 00:31:26,844
But I am asking you
to look at the evidence

356
00:31:26,927 --> 00:31:30,473
that the State will be offering
to back up those words.

357
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:33,768
You'll find that there is none.

358
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:36,937
Furthermore, you are going to hear
that there's a good chance

359
00:31:37,021 --> 00:31:42,568
no one murdered Chase Andrews
and that the defendant, Miss Clark,

360
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:47,907
finds herself here because it is easier
to lay blame on an outsider

361
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:51,285
than it is to rely on facts.

362
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:57,374
And although she was born and grew up
not five miles from this courtroom,

363
00:31:58,334 --> 00:32:00,211
Miss Clark is an outsider.

a couple times when I was out fishing,

473
00:42:37,806 --> 00:42:40,934
I appreciate you teaching me to read

474
00:42:41,518 --> 00:42:43,770
and all the things you gave me.

475
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:46,106
But why do you do it?

476
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:49,443
Don't you have a girlfriend or something?

477
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,778
Sometimes I do.

478
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:53,447
Sometimes?

479
00:42:54,781 --> 00:42:57,284
I mean, I've had one.

00:42:58,994 --> 00:43:00,370
Uh, but not now...

Uh, all right.

I, uh...

484
00:43:12,549 --> 00:43:15,135
I saw you on your pa's boat the other day.

485
00:43:17,345 --> 00:43:18,597
He seems real nice, your dad.

Yeah. Yeah, he is.

You never talk about your ma.

00:43:32,611 --> 00:43:35,405
Uh, you don't have to say nothing.

490
00:43:36,656 --> 00:43:40,702
My mother and little sister died
in a car wreck over in Asheville.

491
00:43:44,206 --> 00:43:46,416
My little sister's name was Carianne.

492

You can say anything to me.

495
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:09,689
I think they went to Asheville
to buy me my birthday present.

496
00:44:11,483 --> 00:44:14,027
There was this bike I wanted,

497
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:16,738
and Western Auto didn't carry it...

498
00:44:19,115 --> 00:44:21,868
so I think they went into Asheville
to get that bike for me.

499
00:44:22,911 --> 00:44:23,912
[Kya] Oh.

500

[Tom] Sheriff,
I'm handing you the tide table

623
00:58:33,135 --> 00:58:37,890
for the night of October 29
and the morning of October 30.

624
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:43,270
Now, this shows here
that low tide was around midnight.

625
00:58:43,771 --> 00:58:47,775
So at the time
Chase Andrews arrived at the tower

626
00:58:47,858 --> 00:58:51,779
and walked to the steps,
he would have made tracks in the wet mud.

627
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:57,118
And then as the groundwater rose,
those tracks would have been wiped out.

628
00:58:57,201 --> 00:59:00,037
-Do you agree that this is possible?
-Well...

629
00:59:00,121 --> 00:59:03,666
And then you'd agree
that if he had any friends with him,

630
00:59:03,749 --> 00:59:06,711
their footprints would be
washed away as well.

631
00:59:06,794 --> 00:59:09,088
Under these circumstances,

632
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:15,177
the absence of footprints in
and of itself does not suggest a crime.

633
00:59:15,845 --> 00:59:16,846
Correct?

634
00:59:19,932 --> 00:59:20,808
Sheriff?

635
00:59:23,477 --> 00:59:28,315
The absence of footprints does not,
by itself, prove there was a crime.

636
00:59:28,399 --> 00:59:31,444
You also testified
that there were no fingerprints

637
00:59:31,527 --> 00:59:35,698
found anywhere in the fire tower,
including on the open grate.

638
00:59:36,449 --> 00:59:41,662
So this led you to conclude
that someone must have opened the grate

639
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:44,165
and wiped away
their fingerprints afterwards.

640
00:59:44,248 --> 00:59:45,249
Correct.

641
00:59:46,333 --> 00:59:50,963
Now, in fact, isn't it true
that these grates were left open

642
00:59:51,046 --> 00:59:53,758
so often and considered so dangerous

643
00:59:53,841 --> 00:59:56,469
that your office submitted
a written request

644
00:59:56,552 --> 00:59:58,179
to the U.S. Forest Service

645
00:59:58,262 --> 01:00:03,517
to remedy the situation
on July 18 of last year?

646
01:00:06,312 --> 01:00:08,856
This is a copy of that request.

the last sentence of this document

that you sent to the Forest Service?

651
01:00:21,452 --> 01:00:23,078
Just the last sentence.

these grates are very dangerous,

and if action is not taken...

654

a serious injury or death will occur."

01:35:59,796 --> 01:36:03,300
Is she in the courtroom today?

1106
01:36:03,383 --> 01:36:05,677
Yes, that one there. The defendant.

1107
01:36:05,761 --> 01:36:08,263
-[crowd clamoring]
-The one folks call Marsh Girl.

<i>Living in fear, quite another.</i>

<i>I will never live like that.</i>

<i>A life wondering
when the next fist will fall.</i>

Tate, you can't be here.

1120
01:38:34,576 --> 01:38:36,036
I just wanted to check on you.

1121
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:38,622
-Jumpin' said he hadn't seen you since--
-Not now.

1122
01:38:40,290 --> 01:38:41,875
Kya, what happened to your face?

1123
01:38:42,667 --> 01:38:45,170
Was it Chase?
Tell me, Kya. Did he do this?

1124
01:38:45,253 --> 01:38:46,880
I need you to stay out of it.

1125
01:38:46,963 --> 01:38:48,298
That son of a bitch.

1126
01:38:49,091 --> 01:38:51,843
-That son of a bitch.
-Tate, I need you to go.

1127
01:38:51,927 --> 01:38:53,178
Kya.

1128
01:38:59,768 --> 01:39:01,853
You know, I was gonna go
to Greenville next week.

1129
01:39:05,107 --> 01:39:06,733
Finally meet my publishers.

1130
01:39:08,944 --> 01:39:10,529
Talk about the next book.

1131
01:39:11,154 --> 01:39:12,489
I was feeling brave enough.

1132
01:39:12,989 --> 01:39:14,616
Well, you can still go.

1133
01:39:14,699 --> 01:39:16,284
Looking like this?

1134
01:39:16,368 --> 01:39:18,120
Don't let him ruin this for you.

1135
01:39:19,329 --> 01:39:20,413
Go to Greenville.

1136
01:39:21,331 --> 01:39:22,916
Okay? There's a bus.

1137
01:39:22,999 --> 01:39:24,793
It's easy. Jumpin's got the schedule.

1138
01:39:25,710 --> 01:39:27,504
Let them put you up in a nice hotel,

1139
01:39:28,171 --> 01:39:30,382
eat some hot restaurant food
you didn't have to make.

1140
01:39:30,465 --> 01:39:32,342
Stay a week, if you can.

1141
01:39:33,343 --> 01:39:36,221
And I'll come see you
when you're back. Okay?

1142
01:39:37,264 --> 01:39:39,057
Hear how it all went with the publishers.

1143
01:39:39,891 --> 01:39:41,017
[softly] All right.

1144
01:39:48,525 --> 01:39:49,526
Hey, you cold?

1145
01:39:51,361 --> 01:39:54,281
I'm fine. I don't need you
to take care of me.

1146
01:39:54,364 --> 01:39:56,241
I know, but just take my hat.

1147
01:39:56,867 --> 01:39:58,994
-I said I don't need your help.
-Just take it.

[Jumpin'] <i>You wanna tell me
what happened to your eye?</i>

1150
01:40:31,735 --> 01:40:33,820
I need to write down the bus schedule.

1151
01:40:33,904 --> 01:40:35,405
You have a copy, right?

1152
01:40:40,869 --> 01:40:43,663
It was that Chase, wasn't it?

1153
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:47,626
Kya, look at me.

1154
01:40:50,629 --> 01:40:52,547
Now you tell me what he did.

1155
01:40:54,841 --> 01:40:56,092
I can't say it.

1156
01:40:57,719 --> 01:40:58,803
It's over now.

1157
01:40:59,596 --> 01:41:01,389
I just want it out of my life.

1158
01:41:01,473 --> 01:41:03,725
And how you know
he ain't coming after you again?

1159
01:41:05,018 --> 01:41:07,729
-You're all by your lonesome out there.
-Jumpin', please.

1160
01:41:09,022 --> 01:41:10,815
You can't tell anybody.

1161
01:41:11,441 --> 01:41:12,651
You know how it is.

1162
01:41:12,734 --> 01:41:17,948
They'd drag me into the sheriff's office
and make me describe it to a bunch of men.

1163
01:41:19,199 --> 01:41:22,619
And then write me up in the papers,
accusing me of whoring.

1164
01:41:23,703 --> 01:41:25,789
Or trying to get money out of his parents.

1165
01:41:26,665 --> 01:41:28,333
Okay? They'd do nothing about it.

1166
01:41:28,416 --> 01:41:29,459
You're right, Kya.

1167
01:41:32,045 --> 01:41:34,506
And I ain't gonna do anything
to make this thing worse.

1168
01:41:36,758 --> 01:41:40,011
But you let me know
when you're coming and going.

1169
01:41:40,095 --> 01:41:41,137
You hear?

1170
01:41:41,972 --> 01:41:43,848
I gotta know if you're out of town.

1171
01:41:47,269 --> 01:41:50,438
'Cause if I don't see you for a while...

1172
01:41:55,819 --> 01:41:57,153
Thank you, Jumpin'.

1173
01:41:58,238 --> 01:41:59,906
I'm leaving in a few days.

1174
01:42:01,616 --> 01:42:03,243
I'll come see you as soon as I'm back.

1175
01:42:05,578 --> 01:42:06,663
Okay, that's good.

1176
01:42:07,622 --> 01:42:08,623
That's good.

1177
01:42:12,544 --> 01:42:16,840
[Tom] <i>Miss Price, would you tell us
what you saw on the morning of October 29?</i>

1178
01:42:16,923 --> 01:42:18,883
I saw the Marsh Girl...

1179
01:42:18,967 --> 01:42:20,635
Miss Clark, that is. Pardon me.

1180
01:42:20,719 --> 01:42:23,763
-...get on the 9:00 bus.
-[Tom] You've got quite a good memory.

1181
01:42:23,847 --> 01:42:24,889
We all talked about it.

1182
01:42:24,973 --> 01:42:27,434
<i>We'd never seen her
all cleaned up like that.</i>

1183
01:42:27,517 --> 01:42:28,852
<i>Hair combed, makeup.</i>

1184
01:42:29,686 --> 01:42:34,024
[Tom] <i>Just to be clear,
on the morning of October 29,</i>

1185
01:42:34,107 --> 01:42:38,903
<i>you and several others saw
Miss Clark board the 9 a.m. bus</i>

1186
01:42:38,987 --> 01:42:40,822
<i>and leave Barkley Cove.</i>

1187
01:42:40,905 --> 01:42:42,866
-Yes, that's right.
-Thank you, Miss Price.

1188
01:42:42,949 --> 01:42:44,576
No further questions, Your Honor.

1189
01:42:44,659 --> 01:42:49,164
Miss Price, is the Piggly Wiggly open
at 1:30 in the morning?

1190
01:42:49,789 --> 01:42:50,957
No, sir.

1191
01:42:52,042 --> 01:42:53,668
Well, the reason I ask is,

1192
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:57,422
you couldn't have seen who got off
the night bus from Greenville,

1193
01:42:57,964 --> 01:43:00,675
nor could you have seen
who got on the 2:30 a.m. bus

1194
01:43:00,759 --> 01:43:04,304
from Barkley Cove
back to Greenville, could you?

1195
01:43:04,387 --> 01:43:06,056
Well, no. Of course not.

1196
01:43:06,139 --> 01:43:10,977
So after you saw Miss Clark board
that morning bus to Greenville...

1197
01:43:12,729 --> 01:43:15,523
she could have returned
to Barkley Cove that night

1198
01:43:15,607 --> 01:43:19,527
and been back in Greenville for breakfast,
all without you taking notice.

1199
01:43:20,320 --> 01:43:21,821
[man] <i>My name is Robert Foster.</i>

1200
01:43:21,905 --> 01:43:25,116
I'm a senior editor
at Harrison Morris Publishing Company

1201
01:43:25,200 --> 01:43:26,284
in Boston, Massachusetts.

1202
01:43:26,368 --> 01:43:30,663
[Tom] Mr. Foster, you sat down
for dinner with Miss Clark at 7 p.m.

1203
01:43:30,747 --> 01:43:32,791
on the night of October 29.

1204
01:43:32,874 --> 01:43:34,125
-Correct?
-Yes.

1205
01:43:34,209 --> 01:43:36,252
What was your first impression of her?

1206
01:43:37,754 --> 01:43:43,385
My first impression was, uh, that she was
very shy, very gentle, very smart.

1207
01:43:44,344 --> 01:43:46,137
I knew that she was something
of a recluse,

1208
01:43:46,221 --> 01:43:49,099
but I also knew
that she was a gifted naturalist.

1209
01:43:49,182 --> 01:43:52,143
-[Tom] <i>How long did that dinner go on?</i>
<i>-At least a few hours.</i>

1210
01:43:52,227 --> 01:43:53,937
[Kya] Some female insects do eat
their mates.

1211
01:43:54,020 --> 01:43:56,815
Fireflies, in fact,
have two different light signals.

1212
01:43:57,315 --> 01:43:58,441
One for mating,

1213
01:43:58,525 --> 01:44:01,528
and one to attract a male
in order to make him her next meal.

1214
01:44:01,611 --> 01:44:03,363
-[man] So she eats him?
-[woman] How gruesome.

1215
01:44:03,446 --> 01:44:06,116
-[man] Oh, dear.
-I must spend less time with insects.

1216
01:44:06,199 --> 01:44:08,535
-It's quite amoral.
-[woman] Amoral, indeed.

1217
01:44:08,618 --> 01:44:10,954
I don't know
if there is a dark side to nature.

1218
01:44:12,705 --> 01:44:14,499
Just inventive ways to endure.

1219
01:44:15,792 --> 01:44:16,876
Against all odds.

1220
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:21,548
And when you met with Miss Clark
the following morning, October 30th,

1221
01:44:21,631 --> 01:44:25,593
was there anything unusual
about her appearance or her demeanor?

1222
01:44:25,677 --> 01:44:26,845
Not at all.

1223
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,139
[Tom] No further questions, Your Honor.

1224
01:44:29,222 --> 01:44:31,724
Mr. Foster, did Miss Clark stay

1225
01:44:31,808 --> 01:44:34,394
at the same hotel
as you and your colleagues?

1226
01:44:34,477 --> 01:44:37,105
No. She preferred a smaller hotel.

1227
01:44:37,188 --> 01:44:39,732
The, uh, Mountain something.

1228
01:44:39,816 --> 01:44:43,069
Could you look at this map
of Greenville for me, please?

1229
01:44:43,153 --> 01:44:47,740
I think you'll see The Piedmont,
where you and your colleagues stayed,

1230
01:44:47,824 --> 01:44:51,828
and then The Three Mountains Hotel,
where Miss Clark stayed.

1231
01:44:51,911 --> 01:44:55,415
Could you tell me
which one is closest to the bus station?

1232
01:44:57,083 --> 01:44:59,502
The Three Mountains Hotel is closer.

1233
01:44:59,586 --> 01:45:03,214
In fact, The Three Mountains is
the closest hotel

1234
01:45:03,298 --> 01:45:05,508
to the Greenville bus station.
Is that correct?

1235
01:45:06,801 --> 01:45:07,927
Looks that way.

1236
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:10,430
No further questions.

1237
01:45:10,513 --> 01:45:14,017
I don't think a good lawyer ever puts
their client on the stand,

1238
01:45:14,100 --> 01:45:15,685
but this might help you.

1239
01:45:16,394 --> 01:45:20,690
For the jury to be able
to hear from you, directly.

1240
01:45:21,941 --> 01:45:25,028
For them to be able to see you...

1241
01:45:26,404 --> 01:45:28,990
as the kind
and thoughtful person you truly are.

1242
01:45:29,073 --> 01:45:30,700
They're never gonna see me like that.

1243
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:34,204
Listen. I know you have a world
of reasons to hate these people--

1244
01:45:34,287 --> 01:45:35,705
No, I never hated them.

1245
01:45:35,788 --> 01:45:37,290
They hated me.

1246
01:45:38,625 --> 01:45:41,794
They laughed at me. They left me.

1247
01:45:42,378 --> 01:45:44,756
They harassed me. They attacked me.

1248
01:45:44,839 --> 01:45:47,717
You-- You want me to beg for my life?

1249
01:45:48,885 --> 01:45:50,094
I don't have it in me.

1250
01:45:50,720 --> 01:45:51,721
I won't.

1251
01:45:53,556 --> 01:45:56,142
I will not offer myself up.

1252
01:45:56,226 --> 01:45:57,685
They can make their decision.

1253
01:46:00,230 --> 01:46:03,900
But they're not deciding
anything about me.

1254
01:46:05,902 --> 01:46:06,903
It's them.

1255
01:46:08,821 --> 01:46:10,281
They're judging themselves.

1256
01:46:13,034 --> 01:46:14,160
All right, then.

1257
01:46:21,543 --> 01:46:24,712

[Tom clears throat]

1275
01:47:48,379 --> 01:47:52,592
I have lived in Barkley Cove
my whole life.

1276
01:47:53,760 --> 01:47:57,764
And like you, I heard the tall tales

1277
01:47:57,847 --> 01:47:59,766
told about the Marsh Girl.

1278
01:48:00,308 --> 01:48:02,602
That she was part wolf.

1279
01:48:02,685 --> 01:48:06,356
A missing link between ape and man.

1280
01:48:06,856 --> 01:48:09,317
That her eyes glowed in the dark.

1281
01:48:11,069 --> 01:48:13,780
Well, here she is.

1282
01:48:14,656 --> 01:48:18,576
The reality is that she was
an abandoned child.

1283
01:48:18,660 --> 01:48:23,164
A little girl surviving out there
in the marsh on her own,

1284
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:25,875
reviled and shunned.

1285
01:48:28,836 --> 01:48:32,256
Mr. James Madison and his wife, Mabel,

1286
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,592
they are sitting here
in the courtroom today.

1287
01:48:34,676 --> 01:48:38,596
They're about the only people
in this town who showed her any care.

1288
01:48:38,680 --> 01:48:40,056
The rest of us...

1289
01:48:42,517 --> 01:48:44,394
Well, I'm ashamed to say

1290
01:48:45,561 --> 01:48:51,150
that we labeled her and rejected her
because we thought she was different.

1291
01:48:51,859 --> 01:48:53,152
And now...

1292
01:48:55,071 --> 01:48:58,825
the job of judging this shy
and rejected young woman

1293
01:48:58,908 --> 01:49:01,494
has fallen on your shoulders.

1294
01:49:01,577 --> 01:49:06,999
But you must base your judgment
on the facts presented in this courtroom,

1295
01:49:07,083 --> 01:49:13,172
and not on the rumors and feelings
from the past 25 years.

1296
01:49:13,256 --> 01:49:16,175
Miss Clark has a solid alibi.

1297
01:49:16,259 --> 01:49:19,595
She was in Greenville
the night Chase Andrews died.

1298
01:49:19,679 --> 01:49:24,517
And what facts, exactly,
stand against her?

1299
01:49:26,352 --> 01:49:31,315
The State has not proven
that this incident was indeed a murder,

1300
01:49:31,399 --> 01:49:34,485
and not just some tragic accident.

1301
01:49:35,528 --> 01:49:39,198
The State wants you to believe
that at 11:30 at night,

1302
01:49:39,282 --> 01:49:41,826
without a single witness seeing her,

1303
01:49:41,909 --> 01:49:45,288
she caught the last bus
from Greenville to Barkley Cove,

1304
01:49:45,371 --> 01:49:47,999
and rode that bus disguised,

1305
01:49:48,082 --> 01:49:51,419
since neither of the bus drivers
that night could identify her

1306
01:49:51,502 --> 01:49:54,630
as a passenger,
all the way back to Barkley Cove.

1307
01:49:54,714 --> 01:49:58,468
And then, in less than an hour...

1308
01:50:00,178 --> 01:50:03,014
she tracks down Chase Andrews
in the middle of the night,

1309
01:50:03,097 --> 01:50:05,600
lures him to the tower, murders him,

1310
01:50:05,683 --> 01:50:07,769
wipes away all physical evidence,

1311
01:50:07,852 --> 01:50:12,732
and somehow catches
the 2:30 a.m. bus back to Greenville.

1312
01:50:12,815 --> 01:50:15,318
Again,
without a single witness seeing her.

1313
01:50:15,401 --> 01:50:18,321
And after doing all that,

1314
01:50:19,572 --> 01:50:23,034
she meets with her publishers
the next morning, unruffled.

1315
01:50:23,117 --> 01:50:25,036
Now, these are not facts.

1316
01:50:25,953 --> 01:50:28,790
These are just more of the rumors

1317
01:50:28,873 --> 01:50:34,253
and tall tales that we have been spreading
about Miss Clark her entire life.

1318
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:39,050
I believe you will come
to a judgment based on the facts,

1319
01:50:39,133 --> 01:50:42,512
and not the gossip
that you have heard for years.

1320
01:50:43,554 --> 01:50:45,848
It's time, at last,

1321
01:50:46,933 --> 01:50:51,020

1324
01:50:58,236 --> 01:51:00,613
Well, let's hope
they take a good long while.

1325
01:51:00,696 --> 01:51:04,575
If a few jurors have doubts,
we got a chance.

1326
01:51:19,298 --> 01:51:22,677
[judge] Mr. Foreman, is it correct
that the jury has reached a verdict?
