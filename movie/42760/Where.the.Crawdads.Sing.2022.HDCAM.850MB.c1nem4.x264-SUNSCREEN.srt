1
00:00:19,528 --> 00:00:22,464
<i>Then within the marsh,</i>
<i>here and there...</i>

2
00:00:24,566 --> 00:00:26,001
<i>true swamp.</i>

3
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:09,378
<i>A swamp knows</i>
<i>all about death...</i>

4
00:01:09,411 --> 00:01:11,779
<i>and doesn't necessarily</i>
<i>define it as tragedy.</i>

5
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,550
<i>Certainly not a sin.</i>

6
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:20,422
I thought Chase Andrews
would have more common sense.

7
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:22,524
Best quarterback
this town ever had.

8
00:01:26,228 --> 00:01:29,031
Boys, are these
your footprints here?

9
00:01:29,064 --> 00:01:30,632
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

10
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:39,141
Where's his footprints?

11
00:01:46,248 --> 00:01:49,518
Yeah, some kids just get
crazy ideas in their heads

12
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:52,853
and drink and think
they're invincible.

13
00:01:52,887 --> 00:01:55,591
That Chase Andrews
was no kid.

14
00:02:08,103 --> 00:02:10,572
Hey. Look at this.

15
00:02:19,747 --> 00:02:21,416
He open the grate himself?

16
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,619
Could've been an accident,
all the same.

17
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:27,055
Time of death,
between midnight and 2 a.m.

18
00:02:27,089 --> 00:02:31,560
Cause of death, sudden impact
from the 63-foot drop.

19
00:02:31,593 --> 00:02:35,731
Since you found that blood
and hair on the support beam,

20
00:02:35,763 --> 00:02:39,735
I would deduce that was
the cause of the primary injury.

21
00:02:39,767 --> 00:02:41,503
Laymen's terms,

22
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:44,172
he banged the back of his head
on the way down.

23
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,074
To hit the back of his head
on the beam,

24
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:48,410
he would've needed to fall
backwards, is that right?

25
00:02:48,443 --> 00:02:51,480
I'd say yes.
So he might have been pushed.

26
00:02:51,513 --> 00:02:54,449
There's no fingerprints on the
railing, the grates, nothing.

27
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:57,686
No fingerprints?
Not from Chase either?

28
00:02:59,121 --> 00:03:01,323
No fingerprints, no tracks.

29
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:06,128
We do have those red fibers
found on the jacket.

30
00:03:06,161 --> 00:03:09,498
I just got the lab report
back from Atlanta.

31
00:03:09,531 --> 00:03:12,933
They did not come
from any of his other clothing.

32
00:03:12,967 --> 00:03:17,472
Wool, it says.
That could be a sweater, scarf.

33
00:03:17,506 --> 00:03:20,609
Hell, it could be anything.
And we gotta find it.

34
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:23,011
A beautiful wife, good family.

35
00:03:23,045 --> 00:03:24,812
Can't think of anyone
who'd want to kill Chase.

36
00:03:24,845 --> 00:03:26,615
Come on.
You know how Chase was.

37
00:03:26,648 --> 00:03:29,451
Tomcattin', ruttin' around
like a penned-up bull let out.

38
00:03:29,484 --> 00:03:30,985
Don't speak ill of the dead,
Frank.

39
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,387
Heh, I'm just saying

40
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,489
I could think
of a few guys up to it.

41
00:03:34,523 --> 00:03:36,458
Mr. Milton.
Hi, Sandy.

42
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:38,493
The usual? Brunswick stew?
How'd you guess.

43
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:42,564
What do you make
of the Chase Andrews case, Tom?

44
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:45,500
Oh, I'm retired. That's none
of my business anymore.

45
00:03:45,534 --> 00:03:46,802
Fair enough.

46
00:03:46,834 --> 00:03:48,337
Could've been that woman
in the marsh.

47
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,904
She's crazy enough
for the loony bin.

48
00:03:49,937 --> 00:03:51,707
I bet she'd be up
to something like this.

49
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:54,376
My brother's told me that
Marsh Girl's the missing link.

50
00:03:54,409 --> 00:03:55,843
You know poor Chase Andrews

51
00:03:55,876 --> 00:03:57,412
had something going on
down in that marsh.

52
00:03:57,446 --> 00:03:59,014
Chase Andrews
and the Marsh Girl?

53
00:03:59,047 --> 00:04:01,083
Now if that ain't asking
for trouble.

54
00:04:03,585 --> 00:04:05,587
What do you think
really happened, Frank?

55
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,522
You think that
Marsh Girl killed Chase?

56
00:04:07,556 --> 00:04:10,058
- Hell, I don't know.
- Truth will come out.

57
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:37,853
Look at all these feathers
and whatnot.

58
00:04:39,121 --> 00:04:40,622
She a scientist

59
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:42,257
or a witch?

60
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:47,062
Miss Clark?

61
00:04:50,599 --> 00:04:52,801
Sheriff's Department.
Sheriff.

62
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:55,903
Look.

63
00:04:55,936 --> 00:04:58,106
Could get a warrant.

64
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:00,575
Plain view.
Probable cause, sheriff.

65
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:05,380
Bet that door
isn't even locked.

66
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:58,500
There she is.

67
00:05:58,533 --> 00:06:00,702
This is the Sheriff's
Department.

68
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,871
Shut down your engine.

69
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:13,048
Go straight, go straight.
Follow her in!

70
00:06:52,387 --> 00:06:54,356
- You're guilty!
- You killed Chase Andrews!

71
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,590
You'll pay for this,
Marsh Girl!

72
00:06:55,624 --> 00:06:56,558
Rot in jail!

73
00:07:44,576 --> 00:07:46,344
Sunday Justice.

74
00:07:46,378 --> 00:07:47,746
Where you gone, kitty?

75
00:07:48,947 --> 00:07:50,549
Please stay.

76
00:07:50,582 --> 00:07:52,083
Here, kitty, kitty.

77
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:10,268
Miss Clark?

78
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:14,105
I'm Tom Milton.

79
00:08:14,139 --> 00:08:16,775
I'm a lawyer. May I come in?

80
00:08:22,747 --> 00:08:24,282
Thank you, Mr. Frazier.

81
00:08:24,316 --> 00:08:26,117
You probably know

82
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:29,588
that you're being held
for the murder of Chase Andrews.

83
00:08:29,621 --> 00:08:31,790
And I have taken the liberty

84
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:34,060
of putting myself forward
to defend you.

85
00:08:34,092 --> 00:08:36,494
I know you've never been
in trouble before,

86
00:08:36,528 --> 00:08:39,831
so I can explain the courtroom
and the trial

87
00:08:39,864 --> 00:08:41,833
and who is who
and whatnot.

88
00:08:45,337 --> 00:08:49,107
Uh, do you have family that you
might want to come be with you?

89
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,978
Uh...

90
00:08:56,448 --> 00:09:01,219
Miss Clark, I don't quite know
how to put this, but, uh...

91
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:05,123
Well, I know you

92
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:07,258
as Catherine Danielle Clark,

93
00:09:07,292 --> 00:09:11,129
but here in Barkley Cove they
don't call you by that name.

94
00:09:11,162 --> 00:09:13,832
They call you Marsh Girl.

95
00:09:13,865 --> 00:09:16,801
And when you stand trial,

96
00:09:16,835 --> 00:09:19,537
you will be judged
by a jury of your peers

97
00:09:19,571 --> 00:09:22,707
from Barkley Cove,
who only know you as such.

98
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:26,911
They are going to judge you
whether they know you or not.

99
00:09:28,713 --> 00:09:34,219
But I can't help you
unless I know you.

100
00:09:34,252 --> 00:09:36,554
Even just a little bit.

101
00:09:40,558 --> 00:09:42,160
Well, all right, then. Um...

102
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:45,497
I'll come back in a while

103
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:47,732
when you've had time
to consider.

104
00:09:49,768 --> 00:09:54,040
Oh, and I brought you this
just in the meantime.

105
00:10:01,513 --> 00:10:02,914
Mr. Frazier.

106
00:10:07,285 --> 00:10:10,622
People forget about the
creatures who live in shells.

107
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:15,593
I had a family once.

108
00:10:17,962 --> 00:10:19,564
They called me Kya.

109
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:27,372
Kya!

110
00:10:27,405 --> 00:10:30,341
Kya! You'd better not get
too far out.

111
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:33,545
Get it, get it!

112
00:10:50,162 --> 00:10:52,131
Now this little piggy
went to market.

113
00:10:52,164 --> 00:10:53,665
Now you hold still.

114
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,104
This little piggy stayed home.

115
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:01,107
This little piggy
ate roast beef.

116
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,575
This little piggy had none.

117
00:11:03,608 --> 00:11:06,411
And this little piggy

118
00:11:06,444 --> 00:11:09,614
went wee-wee-wee-wee
all the way home.

119
00:11:13,585 --> 00:11:15,754
That's my special girl.

120
00:11:19,257 --> 00:11:21,193
Hey, Jodie!

121
00:11:23,028 --> 00:11:24,496
Hey, Tate!

122
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:26,531
Wanna come fishing?

123
00:11:28,299 --> 00:11:31,269
- I ain't got too much time.
- "Ain't" isn't a real word.

124
00:11:33,304 --> 00:11:37,143
Hey, how many times I told you
not to mess in my goddamn boat?!

125
00:11:39,145 --> 00:11:41,446
Get in the house!
Are you stupid?!

126
00:11:44,049 --> 00:11:48,020
Come here! Now you've done it.

127
00:11:48,053 --> 00:11:49,988
You gotta learn respect.
You hear me?

128
00:11:51,723 --> 00:11:54,526
Stop it! You're hurting her!
Hey, you leave my pa alone!

129
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:56,861
Come back on my land,
I'll shoot you! You hear me?!

130
00:11:56,895 --> 00:11:59,098
Calm down now.
Shut up!

131
00:12:00,698 --> 00:12:02,201
Shut up!

132
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:07,338
- Leave me alone!
- I'll show you!

133
00:12:07,372 --> 00:12:08,606
Please just stop!

134
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,048
Ma!

135
00:12:51,349 --> 00:12:52,550
Ma?

136
00:13:01,427 --> 00:13:02,561
<i>Ma never came back.</i>

137
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:08,201
<i>And everybody else was quick</i>
<i>to get out the same way.</i>

138
00:13:08,235 --> 00:13:10,203
<i>Murph was the first to leave.</i>

139
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:15,208
<i>A few months later,</i>
<i>Mandy and Missy.</i>

140
00:13:18,211 --> 00:13:21,714
<i>Then, finally, Jodie.</i>

141
00:13:21,747 --> 00:13:22,781
Kya.

142
00:13:24,383 --> 00:13:26,385
Kya, listen.

143
00:13:26,418 --> 00:13:28,188
I have to go, Kya.

144
00:13:28,221 --> 00:13:29,788
I can't live here no longer.

145
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,095
Kya, you be careful, hear?

146
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:36,395
If you're in trouble,

147
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:38,231
run and hide deep in the marsh

148
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:39,965
way out
where the crawdads sing.

149
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:43,003
Like Ma always says.

150
00:14:02,088 --> 00:14:03,156
Run!

151
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:06,425
Jodie!

152
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:09,262
<i>I learned from the mistakes</i>
<i>of the others</i>

153
00:14:09,296 --> 00:14:10,330
<i>how to live with him.</i>

154
00:14:13,499 --> 00:14:14,767
<i>Just keep out of the way.</i>

155
00:14:15,868 --> 00:14:18,071
<i>Don't let him see you.</i>

156
00:14:18,104 --> 00:14:19,372
<i>Fend for yourself.</i>

157
00:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,727
<i>I had been out in the marsh</i>
<i>plenty of times with Jodie,</i>

158
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,229
<i>but never alone.</i>

159
00:15:17,763 --> 00:15:19,965
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>which way was home.</i>

160
00:15:19,999 --> 00:15:22,901
Damn you for leaving me here,
Jodie!

161
00:15:25,005 --> 00:15:26,239
Damn you.

162
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,051
You okay?

163
00:15:40,586 --> 00:15:42,888
You're Jodie Clark's sister.

164
00:15:42,921 --> 00:15:45,125
Used to be. He's gone.

165
00:15:48,261 --> 00:15:49,695
You know your way home?

166
00:15:49,728 --> 00:15:50,963
Yeah.

167
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,572
It's okay.
I get lost all the time.

168
00:16:10,283 --> 00:16:13,086
My name's Tate,
in case you see me again.

169
00:16:13,119 --> 00:16:14,120
<i>Tate.</i>

170
00:16:15,654 --> 00:16:17,689
<i>There was something</i>
<i>about that boy</i>

171
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:20,093
<i>that eased the tightness</i>
<i>in my chest.</i>

172
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:23,063
<i>For the first time</i>
<i>since Ma and Jodie left,</i>

173
00:16:23,096 --> 00:16:25,065
<i>I felt something</i>
<i>other than hurt.</i>

174
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:29,135
<i>I felt brave.</i>

175
00:16:31,570 --> 00:16:32,771
I'm hungry.

176
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:49,456
Morning, Mr. Clark.
How you doing?

177
00:16:49,489 --> 00:16:51,224
Well, Jumpin',

178
00:16:51,257 --> 00:16:53,493
I woke up
on the right side of dirt.

179
00:16:55,195 --> 00:16:58,931
Oh, this is my daughter,
Miss Kya Clark.

180
00:16:58,964 --> 00:17:02,168
Well, I'm mighty proud
to know you, Miss Kya.

181
00:17:02,202 --> 00:17:05,505
Oh, don't mind her. I tell her
stay away from everybody.

182
00:17:05,538 --> 00:17:07,140
It's a dangerous world,
isn't it?

183
00:17:07,173 --> 00:17:09,242
It is.
But the fishing's good.

184
00:17:09,275 --> 00:17:11,411
Could I get a bag of grits?

185
00:17:11,444 --> 00:17:14,481
And, um, some of that Jim Beam?

186
00:17:14,514 --> 00:17:16,149
And maybe you fill her up
for me?

187
00:17:16,182 --> 00:17:18,017
It's okay.

188
00:17:18,051 --> 00:17:19,018
Mabel.

189
00:17:19,052 --> 00:17:20,453
Mm-hm.

190
00:17:23,523 --> 00:17:25,391
You wait for our change,
you hear?

191
00:17:28,294 --> 00:17:31,331
Helping out your pa
while your ma's gone, huh?

192
00:17:31,364 --> 00:17:34,467
I ain't seen her in a while.

193
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:36,369
She's doing chores at home.

194
00:17:36,402 --> 00:17:37,870
Mm-hm.

195
00:17:41,474 --> 00:17:43,009
Grits ain't much to go on.

196
00:17:46,012 --> 00:17:47,679
All right. Let's see here.

197
00:17:47,713 --> 00:17:50,283
Your pa left $2 here.

198
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:56,189
And the bill is $1.50.

199
00:17:56,222 --> 00:17:58,091
How much does that leave
for gas?

200
00:18:04,364 --> 00:18:05,632
Don't worry about that.

201
00:18:05,664 --> 00:18:08,201
I got another question
for you.

202
00:18:08,234 --> 00:18:09,935
You go to school, honey?

203
00:18:12,172 --> 00:18:14,507
Do you know that they publish
the school lunch menu

204
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:15,807
in the paper?

205
00:18:15,841 --> 00:18:17,277
Today's is...

206
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:20,413
Salisbury steak.

207
00:18:20,446 --> 00:18:24,816
You could get a nice, hot meal,
make some friends.

208
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:27,719
Plenty of kids go to school
without shoes.

209
00:18:27,753 --> 00:18:30,657
But you will need a skirt.

210
00:18:30,689 --> 00:18:32,991
Ask your mama for one.

211
00:18:33,026 --> 00:18:34,726
There you go.

212
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,031
And the change is 50 cents.

213
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:24,977
Boys!
Chase Andrews,

214
00:19:25,011 --> 00:19:26,613
what you got
to say for yourself?

215
00:19:26,646 --> 00:19:28,248
Sorry, Miss Pansy.

216
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:31,184
We didn't see you
'cause that girl got in the way.

217
00:19:32,951 --> 00:19:34,020
Hello there.

218
00:19:35,255 --> 00:19:36,623
I think you've got yourself

219
00:19:36,656 --> 00:19:38,757
turned around the wrong way,
little lady.

220
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:40,493
Isn't school that way?

221
00:19:40,526 --> 00:19:41,661
- So dirty.
- Gross.

222
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:45,831
You have just as much
of a right to be there.

223
00:19:45,864 --> 00:19:48,635
Go along now.
It's all right.

224
00:19:53,606 --> 00:19:56,609
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark,

225
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,678
are you reading and writing
already?

226
00:20:01,147 --> 00:20:02,948
Can you spell "dog," honey?

227
00:20:07,287 --> 00:20:09,022
Who is that?

228
00:20:09,055 --> 00:20:11,658
G-O-D.

229
00:20:14,993 --> 00:20:17,929
Well, we can all use practice,
can't we?

230
00:20:17,963 --> 00:20:21,867
You can go ahead and sit down,
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

231
00:20:24,337 --> 00:20:25,937
Where you been, marsh hen?

232
00:20:25,971 --> 00:20:28,041
Where's your hat, swamp rat?

233
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:32,478
Now, boys and girls, settle
down. Just an hour until lunch.

234
00:20:32,512 --> 00:20:34,980
Please, try to pay attention
to our lesson.

235
00:20:35,014 --> 00:20:38,184
Who can tell me a word
that has a long vowel sound?

236
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:40,019
She probably lives in the mud.

237
00:20:40,053 --> 00:20:41,354
Someone's got cooties.

238
00:20:42,555 --> 00:20:44,190
That stink in the room.

239
00:20:45,224 --> 00:20:46,292
Excuse me.

240
00:20:48,661 --> 00:20:51,997
<i>- That was the only day</i>
<i>- I ever spent in school.</i>

241
00:20:52,031 --> 00:20:54,334
<i>Reckoned I was better off</i>
<i>learning from the wild.</i>

242
00:20:57,036 --> 00:21:00,173
Hi, Tate!

243
00:21:00,206 --> 00:21:01,607
Mm-mm.

244
00:21:15,188 --> 00:21:18,257
Need you to be careful out here.
You hear me?

245
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,892
Mm-hm.
You can't trust nobody.

246
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:22,795
You protect yourself.

247
00:21:38,578 --> 00:21:40,413
Great horned owl, probably.

248
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:45,118
<i>For a while,</i>
<i>Pa was good to me.</i>

249
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:55,961
I thought you could use this

250
00:21:55,994 --> 00:21:58,531
for your feathers, bird nests.

251
00:21:58,564 --> 00:22:00,233
Other stuff you collect.

252
00:22:03,136 --> 00:22:05,104
Oh, thank you.
Yeah.

253
00:22:12,311 --> 00:22:14,313
It was my old Army--
Mail!

254
00:22:15,782 --> 00:22:17,583
It's my old Army knapsack.

255
00:22:25,591 --> 00:22:28,594
It's from Ma!
It's from Ma!

256
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:30,663
It's Ma's handwriting!

257
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:33,666
Ma's alive!
Give it to me.

258
00:22:33,699 --> 00:22:34,767
Give it to me.

259
00:22:40,972 --> 00:22:43,609
When's she coming home?
Wait.

260
00:22:43,643 --> 00:22:45,011
What does she say?

261
00:22:49,015 --> 00:22:49,981
No!

262
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:51,284
Quiet.

263
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:53,786
Pa! Pa, stop!

264
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:56,522
Stop it! Stop that!

265
00:22:56,556 --> 00:22:58,357
Stop!
Quiet. Quiet!

266
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:00,893
Ma.

267
00:23:02,028 --> 00:23:03,930
Now you listen to me.

268
00:23:03,962 --> 00:23:06,466
She ain't never coming back.

269
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:07,834
You hear me?

270
00:23:15,074 --> 00:23:16,676
That isn't true.

271
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:21,881
"Ain't" isn't even a real word!

272
00:23:32,859 --> 00:23:34,594
Goddamn bitch!

273
00:23:38,331 --> 00:23:40,032
Useless.

274
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:43,669
<i>Pa took to burning</i>
<i>any trace of Ma.</i>

275
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:45,872
Get your shit
out of my house.

276
00:23:50,443 --> 00:23:51,711
<i>And then one day...</i>

277
00:23:52,945 --> 00:23:54,447
<i>he was gone.</i>

278
00:23:56,682 --> 00:23:58,584
<i>Wasn't like the pain</i>
<i>when Ma left.</i>

279
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:00,653
<i>But being completely alone</i>

280
00:24:00,686 --> 00:24:03,589
<i>was a feeling so vast,</i>
<i>it echoed.</i>

281
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:27,246
<i>And there was the small matter</i>
<i>of surviving.</i>

282
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,185
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>how to do life without grits.</i>

283
00:25:01,747 --> 00:25:03,316
Well, hello, Miss Kya.

284
00:25:03,349 --> 00:25:04,584
Uh--

285
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:09,589
You want something?

286
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:10,856
Mr. Jumpin'...

287
00:25:12,325 --> 00:25:15,294
I hear tell y'all buy mussels.

288
00:25:15,328 --> 00:25:16,829
I got some here.

289
00:25:18,931 --> 00:25:21,601
They fresh?
Dug them before dawn.

290
00:25:21,634 --> 00:25:23,169
Just now.

291
00:25:23,202 --> 00:25:25,605
Your pa sent you out
with these?

292
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,144
Look, I tell you what,

293
00:25:32,178 --> 00:25:34,447
I'll give you 50 cent
for the one bag

294
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,449
and a full tank of gas
for the other.

295
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:38,618
How many bags
y'all need a week?

296
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:40,319
Are we striking up
a business deal?

297
00:25:42,888 --> 00:25:47,027
I buy about 40 pound
every two, three days.

298
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:48,661
Mind you,
others bring them too.

299
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:51,797
So if you bring them,
and I already got some,

300
00:25:51,831 --> 00:25:53,666
why, you'd just be out.

301
00:25:53,699 --> 00:25:57,136
It's first come, first served.
Ain't no other way of doing it.

302
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:59,805
That's fine. Thank you.

303
00:26:02,009 --> 00:26:03,175
Can I, uh...?

304
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:05,811
Oh, yeah.

305
00:26:17,723 --> 00:26:20,893
You sure are growing up fast,
huh?

306
00:26:20,926 --> 00:26:23,663
Why don't you come by next week,
I'll measure your feet.

307
00:26:23,696 --> 00:26:26,133
I got some shoes
in the church donation bin

308
00:26:26,165 --> 00:26:27,967
just collecting dust.

309
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,003
Thank you, ma'am.
Sure.

310
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,883
Poor child.

311
00:26:43,916 --> 00:26:45,317
Her ma's gone,

312
00:26:45,351 --> 00:26:48,821
and now her pa's gone too,
I bet.

313
00:26:48,854 --> 00:26:49,989
What?

314
00:26:50,023 --> 00:26:51,590
We ought to be careful,

315
00:26:51,624 --> 00:26:53,392
messing in folk business.

316
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:55,327
It don't say that
in the Bible.

317
00:26:55,361 --> 00:26:57,396
"Be careful."

318
00:26:57,430 --> 00:27:00,833
"And the King shall answer
and say unto them,

319
00:27:00,866 --> 00:27:02,601
verily I say unto thee,

320
00:27:02,635 --> 00:27:05,072
inasmuch as ye hath done it

321
00:27:05,105 --> 00:27:07,740
unto the least of these,
my brethren,

322
00:27:07,773 --> 00:27:09,109
ye have done it unto me."

323
00:27:09,142 --> 00:27:10,242
All right, Mabel.

324
00:27:11,377 --> 00:27:12,845
Don't say about "be careful."

325
00:27:25,891 --> 00:27:27,359
Let's see.

326
00:27:31,797 --> 00:27:33,833
One, two, three. That's all.

327
00:27:49,082 --> 00:27:51,184
<i>They're from Miss Mabel.</i>

328
00:28:04,497 --> 00:28:08,667
Catherine Danielle Clark, of
Barkley County, North Carolina,

329
00:28:08,701 --> 00:28:11,504
is charged with the murder
in the first degree

330
00:28:11,537 --> 00:28:13,939
of Chase Lawrence Andrews,

331
00:28:13,973 --> 00:28:16,408
formerly of Barkley Cove.

332
00:28:16,442 --> 00:28:18,444
In such cases,
the State is allowed

333
00:28:18,477 --> 00:28:20,147
to seek the death penalty.

334
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,648
The prosecution has announced
it will do so

335
00:28:22,681 --> 00:28:25,651
if the defendant
is found guilty.

336
00:28:25,684 --> 00:28:27,586
Guilty! We all know
she's guilty.

337
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,756
She's guilty.

338
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,858
We will now begin
jury selection.

339
00:28:32,892 --> 00:28:35,128
Will our prospective jurors
in the first two rows...

340
00:28:35,162 --> 00:28:40,499
There is an option. It's
what's called a plea bargain.

341
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:44,104
And it means that
if you are willing to say

342
00:28:44,137 --> 00:28:46,972
that you did go to the tower
that night

343
00:28:47,007 --> 00:28:49,775
and met Chase Andrews there

344
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:54,513
and you had a disagreement,
and in a horrible accident

345
00:28:54,547 --> 00:28:56,682
he stepped backwards
through the grate.

346
00:28:56,715 --> 00:29:00,653
You'd get 10 years,
but you'd be out in six.

347
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:02,488
No.

348
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:04,657
If we lose, we lose big.

349
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:08,161
It's life in prison,
or the other.

350
00:29:08,195 --> 00:29:11,064
Mr. Milton, I won't say
anything that implies guilt.

351
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:14,366
I will not go to prison.

352
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,734
Please call me Tom.

353
00:29:15,768 --> 00:29:18,138
And promise me
that you will think about this.

354
00:29:18,171 --> 00:29:19,572
I have to get out of here.

355
00:29:20,873 --> 00:29:22,708
One way...

356
00:29:22,741 --> 00:29:24,077
or the other.

357
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:26,345
Between midnight and 2 a.m.

358
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:28,814
on October 30th...

359
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:32,685
the defendant lured
Chase Andrews to the tower

360
00:29:32,718 --> 00:29:34,720
and pushed him to his death.

361
00:29:34,753 --> 00:29:37,090
She then covered up her tracks
and fingerprints.

362
00:29:37,123 --> 00:29:39,259
Now, you're gonna hear
she had the time,

363
00:29:39,292 --> 00:29:42,361
she had the motivation,
but most importantly...

364
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:46,665
she has the weakness
of character

365
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:48,767
to murder Chase Andrews.

366
00:29:54,406 --> 00:29:57,743
Ladies and gentlemen,
the State is going to throw

367
00:29:57,776 --> 00:29:59,778
a lot of words at you

368
00:29:59,812 --> 00:30:02,781
about Miss Catherine
Danielle Clark.

369
00:30:04,317 --> 00:30:06,253
But I am asking you

370
00:30:06,286 --> 00:30:09,055
to look at the evidence that
the State will be offering

371
00:30:09,089 --> 00:30:11,757
to back up those words.

372
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:14,294
You'll find that there is none.

373
00:30:14,327 --> 00:30:17,529
Furthermore, you are going to
hear that there's a good chance

374
00:30:17,563 --> 00:30:20,100
no one murdered Chase Andrews

375
00:30:20,133 --> 00:30:24,570
and that the defendant,
Miss Clark, finds herself here

376
00:30:24,603 --> 00:30:28,440
because it is easier
to lay blame on an outsider

377
00:30:28,474 --> 00:30:31,810
than it is to rely on facts.

378
00:30:31,844 --> 00:30:34,580
And although she was born

379
00:30:34,613 --> 00:30:38,751
and grew up not five miles
from this courtroom,

380
00:30:38,784 --> 00:30:40,753
Miss Clark is an outsider.

381
00:32:33,567 --> 00:32:34,535
Oh.

382
00:32:40,373 --> 00:32:41,708
Hi.

383
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:43,911
It's me. Tate.

384
00:33:06,633 --> 00:33:07,768
Tundra swan.

385
00:33:09,302 --> 00:33:10,537
How do you know birds?

386
00:33:10,571 --> 00:33:12,639
My ma liked birds.

387
00:33:16,743 --> 00:33:18,277
I can't read your note.

388
00:33:22,849 --> 00:33:25,384
Oh, all I said was I'd seen you

389
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:27,253
a couple times
when I was out fishing,

390
00:33:27,286 --> 00:33:30,057
and it got me thinking that
maybe you could use some seeds

391
00:33:30,089 --> 00:33:32,258
and a spark plug.
I had extra.

392
00:33:32,291 --> 00:33:35,596
Thought it might save you
a trip to town.

393
00:33:35,629 --> 00:33:39,365
And, uh, I don't know, I figured
you'd like the feathers.

394
00:33:43,102 --> 00:33:44,470
All right, then.

395
00:33:49,042 --> 00:33:50,176
All right, then.

396
00:33:55,114 --> 00:33:57,483
Well, I better be going,
so...

397
00:34:04,891 --> 00:34:06,359
I could teach you
to read.

398
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,265
I thought you may as well learn
to write at the same time.

399
00:34:13,299 --> 00:34:14,968
Oh, yeah.

400
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:18,772
Good.
Okay, so we start with A.

401
00:34:18,805 --> 00:34:21,307
Just go ahead and draw
that shape right there.

402
00:34:32,318 --> 00:34:34,121
Don't tell me.

403
00:34:34,153 --> 00:34:35,354
You're getting there.

404
00:34:35,388 --> 00:34:38,457
Don't help me.
Sure. I got all day.

405
00:34:38,491 --> 00:34:43,396
"There are some
who can live

406
00:34:43,429 --> 00:34:48,167
without wild things, comma,

407
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,904
and some who cannot."

408
00:34:51,938 --> 00:34:53,740
Oh.

409
00:34:53,774 --> 00:34:55,575
That's what I'm talking about,
Kya.

410
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:56,910
Whoo!

411
00:34:56,943 --> 00:34:58,679
And there will never be
a time again

412
00:34:58,712 --> 00:35:00,013
when you can't read, ever.

413
00:35:00,047 --> 00:35:02,749
I didn't know words
could hold so much.

414
00:35:02,783 --> 00:35:04,350
Not all words
hold that much.

415
00:35:09,455 --> 00:35:11,390
We could read
at my house sometime.

416
00:35:42,388 --> 00:35:44,725
<i>We went through</i>
<i>the whole library.</i>

417
00:35:44,758 --> 00:35:47,961
<i>Three times a week,</i>
<i>summer into fall.</i>

418
00:35:50,664 --> 00:35:53,100
<i>Read how plants and animals</i>
<i>change over time</i>

419
00:35:53,133 --> 00:35:55,301
<i>to adjust</i>
<i>to the ever-shifting earth.</i>

420
00:35:58,105 --> 00:35:59,906
<i>How birds sing mostly at dawn</i>

421
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,142
<i>because the cool,</i>
<i>moist air of morning</i>

422
00:36:02,175 --> 00:36:04,911
<i>carries their songs and</i>
<i>their meanings much farther.</i>

423
00:36:08,081 --> 00:36:10,117
<i>How some cells divide</i>

424
00:36:10,150 --> 00:36:13,452
<i>and specialize</i>
<i>into lungs or hearts</i>

425
00:36:13,486 --> 00:36:16,288
<i>while others remain</i>
<i>uncommitted as stem cells</i>

426
00:36:16,322 --> 00:36:17,991
<i>in case they're needed later.</i>

427
00:36:19,659 --> 00:36:21,795
<i>Within all the worlds</i>
<i>of biology...</i>

428
00:36:23,163 --> 00:36:24,765
<i>I searched for an explanation</i>

429
00:36:24,798 --> 00:36:26,967
<i>of why a mother would leave</i>
<i>her offspring.</i>

430
00:36:31,772 --> 00:36:34,241
"Mr. Jackson Henry Clark

431
00:36:34,273 --> 00:36:41,114
married Miss Julienne
Maria Jacques, June 12, 1933."

432
00:36:41,148 --> 00:36:42,816
That means

433
00:36:42,849 --> 00:36:45,252
these are my parents.

434
00:36:45,284 --> 00:36:48,955
"Master Jeremy Andrew Clark,
January 2."

435
00:36:48,989 --> 00:36:50,924
That's Jodie.

436
00:36:50,957 --> 00:36:56,495
"Master Napier Murphy Clark,
Miss Mary Helen Clark,

437
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,899
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark."

438
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:08,108
I miss them.

439
00:37:11,244 --> 00:37:12,478
I had, um...

440
00:37:14,748 --> 00:37:16,482
I had forgot how much...

441
00:37:17,851 --> 00:37:19,653
I feel them not here.

442
00:37:22,522 --> 00:37:23,723
But, um...

443
00:37:25,025 --> 00:37:27,393
I feel them not here right now.

444
00:37:27,426 --> 00:37:28,829
I mean...

445
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:33,867
Sometimes I feel
so invisible...

446
00:37:35,434 --> 00:37:37,070
I wonder if I'm here at all.

447
00:37:38,437 --> 00:37:39,706
You are.

448
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:52,719
Sorry I'm late.

449
00:37:52,752 --> 00:37:55,021
Come on. Give me a hand.

450
00:37:55,055 --> 00:37:58,325
Son, you know I don't listen
to idle talk.

451
00:37:58,357 --> 00:38:01,261
But there is a regular riptide
of gossip going around

452
00:38:01,294 --> 00:38:03,263
you got something going on
with that Marsh Girl.

453
00:38:05,098 --> 00:38:07,601
Hey, you know
you can tell me anything.

454
00:38:07,634 --> 00:38:09,669
She your girlfriend?
She's my friend.

455
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:11,905
I bring her books 'cause people
are so nasty to her,

456
00:38:11,938 --> 00:38:13,773
she can't go to school.

457
00:38:13,807 --> 00:38:15,242
She doesn't have any family.

458
00:38:17,077 --> 00:38:22,115
Hey. Come on.
There's no need to be huffy.

459
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:23,750
It's my job to say
all the things

460
00:38:23,783 --> 00:38:25,218
that we don't like
to talk about,

461
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:26,953
and I can't give you
a lot of things

462
00:38:26,987 --> 00:38:28,788
those other dads
can give their sons.

463
00:38:28,822 --> 00:38:30,924
So I'm asking you.

464
00:38:30,957 --> 00:38:32,792
Just be careful.

465
00:38:32,826 --> 00:38:34,761
Everything you've worked
so hard for,

466
00:38:34,794 --> 00:38:37,264
your dreams of going
to Chapel Hill...

467
00:38:37,297 --> 00:38:39,099
Life can change in a second.

468
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:42,969
You understand that?

469
00:38:43,003 --> 00:38:44,371
Yeah.

470
00:38:44,403 --> 00:38:48,108
Now turn up my music,
would you? Come on.

471
00:38:51,177 --> 00:38:53,313
It's Puccini,
in case you're wondering.

472
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:15,235
A young girl
living on her own like that

473
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,337
looks immoral,
don't you think?

474
00:39:17,371 --> 00:39:20,340
No, sir. I don't.
Think, that is.

475
00:39:20,374 --> 00:39:22,975
At least not enough.
Heh, just ask my wife.

476
00:39:25,045 --> 00:39:27,481
There are some fine
group homes

477
00:39:27,514 --> 00:39:30,184
that would help keep
a young woman out of trouble.

478
00:39:30,217 --> 00:39:31,984
Hm.

479
00:39:32,019 --> 00:39:34,321
They say she comes in here
from time to time.

480
00:39:34,354 --> 00:39:37,524
I do see her
from time to time.

481
00:39:37,558 --> 00:39:40,027
She's not alone.
She's got her father with her.

482
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:43,963
Well, I've never seen anybody
home all the times I've been by.

483
00:39:43,996 --> 00:39:45,965
When does she usually
come around?

484
00:39:45,998 --> 00:39:49,203
I never know
just when she'll boat in here.

485
00:39:49,236 --> 00:39:51,905
Have her call me
next time she comes in.

486
00:39:53,474 --> 00:39:55,375
Mm-hm.

487
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:58,545
You don't have any reason
to lie to me, do you, boy?

488
00:39:58,579 --> 00:40:00,747
No reason at all, sir.

489
00:40:17,197 --> 00:40:20,167
We gotta meet somewhere else.
Hi, Kya. Good to see you too.

490
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,169
Social Services
are looking for me again.

491
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:24,471
They're gonna pull me in,
put me in some group home.

492
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,440
It's polite to greet people
when you see them.

493
00:40:32,913 --> 00:40:37,017
You know, a group home
might not be the worst thing.

494
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:40,053
What? No, no. You'd have
someone cooking you warm meals.

495
00:40:40,087 --> 00:40:43,056
Real bed.
I got a real bed.

496
00:40:43,090 --> 00:40:44,691
'Sides, I'd never
leave the marsh

497
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:46,527
to go live with a bunch
of strangers.

498
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:49,696
It's "besides,"
not "'sides."

499
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:51,732
And you can't live alone
in the marsh forever.

500
00:40:51,765 --> 00:40:52,900
Watch me.

501
00:40:54,134 --> 00:40:55,435
All right.

502
00:41:11,285 --> 00:41:12,319
Tate.

503
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:14,788
I, um...

504
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:20,460
I appreciate
you teaching me to read

505
00:41:20,494 --> 00:41:23,230
and all the things you gave me.

506
00:41:24,298 --> 00:41:26,400
But why do you do it?

507
00:41:26,433 --> 00:41:30,038
Don't you have a girlfriend
or something?

508
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,072
Sometimes I do.

509
00:41:32,105 --> 00:41:33,440
Sometimes?

510
00:41:33,473 --> 00:41:37,011
I mean, I've had one.

511
00:41:38,612 --> 00:41:40,414
Uh, but not now...

512
00:41:40,447 --> 00:41:43,017
I don't, so...

513
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,423
All right.

514
00:41:49,456 --> 00:41:50,490
I, uh...

515
00:41:52,026 --> 00:41:54,795
I saw you on your pa's boat
the other day.

516
00:41:56,763 --> 00:41:58,131
He seems real nice,
your dad.

517
00:41:58,165 --> 00:42:00,667
Yeah. Yeah, he is.

518
00:42:00,701 --> 00:42:03,270
You never talk about your ma.

519
00:42:05,138 --> 00:42:06,473
What's she like?

520
00:42:11,979 --> 00:42:13,447
Uh--

521
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:15,616
You don't have to say nothing.

522
00:42:15,649 --> 00:42:18,418
My mother and little sister
died in a car wreck

523
00:42:18,452 --> 00:42:20,387
over in Asheville.

524
00:42:23,690 --> 00:42:26,027
My little sister's name
was Carianne.

525
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,530
It was, uh...

526
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:36,903
What, Tate?

527
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:40,507
You can say anything to me.

528
00:42:46,080 --> 00:42:49,083
I think they went to Asheville
to buy me my birthday present.

529
00:42:50,984 --> 00:42:53,553
There was this bike I wanted,

530
00:42:53,587 --> 00:42:56,189
and Western Auto
didn't carry it...

531
00:42:58,325 --> 00:42:59,826
so I think they went
into Asheville

532
00:42:59,860 --> 00:43:01,328
to get that bike for me.

533
00:43:04,197 --> 00:43:06,600
And I don't even remember
what kind of bike it was.

534
00:43:11,005 --> 00:43:12,673
It wasn't your fault.

535
00:43:24,085 --> 00:43:25,252
Oh!

536
00:43:27,888 --> 00:43:30,024
Oh, my gosh!

537
00:43:52,746 --> 00:43:54,281
Am I your girlfriend now?

538
00:43:54,314 --> 00:43:55,582
Do you wanna be?

539
00:43:56,783 --> 00:43:58,086
I know feathers.

540
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:01,888
Bet the other girls
don't know feathers.

541
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:04,925
All right, then.

542
00:44:06,293 --> 00:44:07,494
All right, then.

543
00:44:40,627 --> 00:44:42,696
Whoo!

544
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,668
I've never been out this way.

545
00:45:21,701 --> 00:45:24,138
It's worth the trip.
You'll see.

546
00:45:25,572 --> 00:45:26,640
Happy birthday, Kya.

547
00:45:29,876 --> 00:45:31,511
How'd you know
it was my birthday?

548
00:45:31,545 --> 00:45:33,080
Oh, I read it in your Bible.

549
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:37,584
Did you know
it was your birthday?

550
00:45:38,852 --> 00:45:40,154
Don't have a calendar.

551
00:45:43,924 --> 00:45:45,959
Oh, um, not my name.

552
00:45:45,992 --> 00:45:47,128
Don't cut my name.

553
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:48,428
Yes, ma'am.

554
00:46:00,107 --> 00:46:01,075
Mm.

555
00:46:01,108 --> 00:46:02,076
Pretty good, huh?

556
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:05,612
What's that?

557
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:08,381
Here they come.

558
00:46:17,457 --> 00:46:19,126
Oh, wow!

559
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,728
Snow geese.

560
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:55,495
Kya.

561
00:46:56,630 --> 00:46:57,564
Kya, look at me.

562
00:47:46,479 --> 00:47:47,480
Kya.

563
00:47:48,682 --> 00:47:50,850
Kya, I'm sorry.

564
00:47:50,884 --> 00:47:52,519
I'm sorry.

565
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:55,323
Jeez.

566
00:47:57,857 --> 00:47:59,960
No, Tate, I want to.

567
00:48:01,395 --> 00:48:02,562
Why not?

568
00:48:03,797 --> 00:48:04,965
Because I...

569
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,402
I care about you too much.

570
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,173
Look, Kya. I want you
more than anything,

571
00:48:12,206 --> 00:48:15,309
but I can't be damaged
as easily.

572
00:48:15,343 --> 00:48:18,079
It's more dangerous for you.
You understand?

573
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:33,893
<i>Fall gave way to winter.</i>

574
00:48:33,927 --> 00:48:36,297
<i>Winter to spring.</i>

575
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:39,799
<i>The only constant in nature</i>
<i>is change.</i>

576
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,801
Dad, I got in!

577
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,059
Why are you quiet?

578
00:49:06,893 --> 00:49:09,497
You know I'm going away soon.

579
00:49:09,529 --> 00:49:10,630
To college.

580
00:49:12,899 --> 00:49:14,301
You talked about it.

581
00:49:16,137 --> 00:49:17,204
When?

582
00:49:18,372 --> 00:49:19,939
Not right away.

583
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:23,643
Soon.

584
00:49:24,978 --> 00:49:27,214
I got a job at the biology lab.

585
00:49:27,248 --> 00:49:29,417
Starts next week, so...

586
00:49:41,095 --> 00:49:43,030
Stay here.

587
00:49:43,064 --> 00:49:44,231
And do what?

588
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,271
No, look. I just mean
there's no work for me here.

589
00:49:50,304 --> 00:49:53,740
What am I gonna do? I don't want
to be a shrimper like my dad.

590
00:49:53,773 --> 00:49:55,809
I'm going to get a degree
and be something, Kya.

591
00:49:55,842 --> 00:49:58,145
So could you.
What do you want me to be?

592
00:49:59,513 --> 00:50:00,713
That's not what I meant.

593
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:02,249
You're never gonna come back.

594
00:50:02,283 --> 00:50:05,386
Yes, I will. I won't
leave you, Kya. I promise.

595
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:07,221
I'm gonna come back to you.

596
00:50:07,254 --> 00:50:09,756
Kya! Kya, stop!

597
00:50:11,624 --> 00:50:13,993
You can't run away
from every whipstitch!

598
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:36,283
One more night.

599
00:50:36,317 --> 00:50:37,784
One more night.

600
00:51:02,576 --> 00:51:03,710
What's this?

601
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:08,848
It's a list of publishers.

602
00:51:08,882 --> 00:51:10,683
For all your drawings
and notes.

603
00:51:10,717 --> 00:51:13,320
There's nothing like them
out there, Kya.

604
00:51:13,354 --> 00:51:15,189
There's enough for a book.

605
00:51:15,222 --> 00:51:16,557
Lots of books.

606
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:21,195
And, you know,
you wouldn't have to leave home.

607
00:51:21,228 --> 00:51:24,331
You could just mail
your samples into a publisher.

608
00:51:24,365 --> 00:51:25,932
You know, bring some money in.

609
00:51:27,434 --> 00:51:30,538
You know,
probably not a huge amount...

610
00:51:30,571 --> 00:51:32,640
but maybe you wouldn't
have to dig mussels

611
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:33,840
the rest of your life.

612
00:51:35,576 --> 00:51:36,709
Just give it a try, Kya.

613
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:40,747
Come on. What can it hurt?

614
00:51:44,118 --> 00:51:46,020
You're gonna forget about me.

615
00:51:48,289 --> 00:51:50,990
When you get busy
with all that college stuff,

616
00:51:51,025 --> 00:51:52,359
all those pretty girls.

617
00:51:52,393 --> 00:51:55,029
I could never forget you, Kya.

618
00:51:55,062 --> 00:51:56,130
Ever.

619
00:51:58,465 --> 00:52:00,334
I'll be home in a month.
I promise.

620
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,436
For the Fourth of July.
Okay?

621
00:52:04,205 --> 00:52:06,173
I'll be back
before you know it.

622
00:52:06,207 --> 00:52:09,043
We'll meet on your beach
and watch fireworks together.

623
00:52:09,076 --> 00:52:11,744
Just write those publishers,
all right?

624
00:52:33,234 --> 00:52:35,302
Goodbye, Kya.

625
00:52:35,336 --> 00:52:36,836
Goodbye, Tate.

626
00:53:04,797 --> 00:53:06,866
<i>Seabirds</i>
<i>of the Eastern Seaboard.</i>

627
00:53:08,269 --> 00:53:10,037
Starring you, Big Red.

628
00:55:11,225 --> 00:55:12,426
No.

629
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,731
No.

00:55:19,600 --> 00:55:20,933

No.

635
00:55:34,848 --> 00:55:37,284
No, no, no.

636
00:55:51,099 --> 00:55:54,335
<i>Tate and life and love</i>
<i>had been the same thing.</i>

637
00:55:55,703 --> 00:55:58,006
<i>They were all gone.</i>

638
00:56:00,542 --> 00:56:02,277
<i>And then...</i>

639
00:56:24,199 --> 00:56:28,069
<i>Whenever I stumbled,</i>
<i>the marsh caught me.</i>

00:56:35,677 --> 00:56:37,378
<i>At some unclaimed moment,</i>

641
00:56:37,412 --> 00:56:39,948
<i>at last,</i>
<i>the heart pain seeped away,</i>

642
00:56:39,980 --> 00:56:41,982
<i>like water into sand.</i>

643
00:56:42,016 --> 00:56:44,052
<i>Still there, but deep.</i>

644
00:56:45,820 --> 00:56:48,156
<i>There were no footprints</i>

<i>or on the fire tower.</i>

00:56:49,724 --> 00:56:51,559
And no fresh fingerprints
either.

647
00:56:51,593 --> 00:56:54,362
Not even on the grate,
which somebody had to open.

648
00:56:54,395 --> 00:56:57,065
All this indicated that someone
had destroyed evidence.

649
00:56:57,098 --> 00:56:58,533
No more questions.

650
00:56:59,767 --> 00:57:01,336
Your witness.

651
00:57:07,909 --> 00:57:11,579
Sheriff, I'm handing you
the tide table

652
00:57:11,613 --> 00:57:16,417
for the night of October 29
and the morning of October 30.

653
00:57:16,451 --> 00:57:21,823
Now, this shows here that
low tide was around midnight.

654
00:57:21,856 --> 00:57:26,327
So at the time Chase Andrews
arrived at the tower

655
00:57:26,361 --> 00:57:27,695
and walked to the steps,

656
00:57:27,729 --> 00:57:30,331
he would have made tracks
in the wet mud.

657
00:57:30,365 --> 00:57:33,034
And then
as the groundwater rose,

658
00:57:33,067 --> 00:57:35,537
those tracks would have
been wiped out.

659
00:57:35,570 --> 00:57:37,238
Do you agree
that this is possible?

660
00:57:37,272 --> 00:57:38,573
Well...

661
00:57:38,606 --> 00:57:39,908
And then you'd agree

662
00:57:39,941 --> 00:57:42,210
that if he had
any friends with him,

663
00:57:42,243 --> 00:57:45,246
their footprints
would be washed away as well.

664
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,615
Under these circumstances,

665
00:57:47,649 --> 00:57:49,851
the absence of footprints

666
00:57:49,884 --> 00:57:54,289
in and of itself
does not suggest a crime.

667
00:57:54,322 --> 00:57:55,723
Correct?

668
00:57:58,326 --> 00:57:59,260
Sheriff?

669
00:58:01,963 --> 00:58:04,532
The absence of footprints
does not,

670
00:58:04,566 --> 00:58:06,868
by itself,
prove there was a crime.

671
00:58:06,901 --> 00:58:09,971
You also testified
that there were no fingerprints

672
00:58:10,005 --> 00:58:12,240
found anywhere
in the fire tower,

673
00:58:12,273 --> 00:58:14,909
including on the open grate.

674
00:58:14,943 --> 00:58:17,478
So this led you
to conclude that

675
00:58:17,512 --> 00:58:20,214
someone must have opened
the grate

676
00:58:20,248 --> 00:58:22,717
and wiped away
their fingerprints afterwards.

677
00:58:22,750 --> 00:58:24,786
Correct.

678
00:58:24,819 --> 00:58:27,322
Now, in fact, isn't it true

679
00:58:27,355 --> 00:58:29,490
that these grates
were left open

680
00:58:29,524 --> 00:58:32,293
so often and considered
so dangerous

681
00:58:32,327 --> 00:58:34,996
that your office submitted
a written request

682
00:58:35,030 --> 00:58:36,731
to the U.S. Forest Service

683
00:58:36,764 --> 00:58:42,537
to remedy the situation
on July 18 of last year?

684
00:58:44,806 --> 00:58:48,409
This is a copy of that request.

685
00:58:48,443 --> 00:58:50,678
Who wrote this, sheriff?

686
00:58:52,313 --> 00:58:53,414
I did it myself.

687
00:58:53,448 --> 00:58:54,916
Would you read to the court

688
00:58:54,949 --> 00:58:57,185
the last sentence
of this document

689
00:58:57,218 --> 00:58:59,921
that you sent
to the Forest Service?

690
00:58:59,954 --> 00:59:02,256
Just the last sentence.

691
00:59:02,290 --> 00:59:05,126
"I must repeat,
these grates are very dangerous,

692
00:59:05,159 --> 00:59:06,961
and if action is not taken...

693
00:59:10,065 --> 00:59:12,433
if action is not taken,
a serious injury

694
00:59:12,467 --> 00:59:13,768
or death will occur."

695
00:59:16,005 --> 00:59:17,505
Thank you, sheriff.

696
01:00:34,686 --> 01:00:37,156
Somebody's been taking pictures
round my house.

697
01:00:37,188 --> 01:00:39,724
What do you think
they want?

698
01:00:39,757 --> 01:00:41,726
Developers.

699
01:00:41,759 --> 01:00:44,829
They've been all up and down
the marsh last few weeks,

700
01:00:44,862 --> 01:00:47,732
wanting to drain the
"murky swamp." Build hotels.

701
01:00:47,765 --> 01:00:49,834
Yeah, I saw them last year.

702
01:00:49,867 --> 01:00:53,438
Cutting oak and digging
channels down the way.

703
01:00:53,471 --> 01:00:54,505
They want my house?

704
01:00:54,539 --> 01:00:56,108
Maybe not the house,

705
01:00:56,141 --> 01:00:58,342
but I bet they offer you
a heap of money for that land.

706
01:00:58,376 --> 01:00:59,711
Jumpin'!
There ain't nothing wrong

707
01:00:59,744 --> 01:01:01,713
with some money going to Kya.

708
01:01:04,482 --> 01:01:07,819
You do own that land, don't you?
You own that house?

709
01:01:10,655 --> 01:01:12,024
Pa said so.

710
01:01:12,057 --> 01:01:14,559
Well, you're gonna need
some proof.

711
01:01:14,592 --> 01:01:16,828
A deed, title.

712
01:01:20,932 --> 01:01:21,966
Hey.

713
01:01:21,999 --> 01:01:23,601
Sorry to startle you.

714
01:01:23,634 --> 01:01:25,436
Can I carry that for ya?

715
01:01:25,470 --> 01:01:28,406
I got it.
Please. Let me get it.

716
01:01:29,907 --> 01:01:31,509
Oh, I'm Chase Andrews.

717
01:01:32,844 --> 01:01:34,412
Your name's Kya, right?

718
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:38,217
Yeah. Yeah. It's a nice name.
I like it.

719
01:01:38,249 --> 01:01:39,984
It's different but nice.

720
01:01:42,587 --> 01:01:43,788
This is yours right here.

721
01:01:45,823 --> 01:01:46,924
There we go.

722
01:01:49,761 --> 01:01:52,530
You wanna go for a picnic
in my boat this Sunday?

723
01:01:58,503 --> 01:02:00,438
Okay.
I'll pick you up at noon

724
01:02:00,471 --> 01:02:02,373
from Point Beach.
Does that work?

725
01:02:03,674 --> 01:02:05,943
All right.
Well, I'll see ya, Kya.

726
01:02:17,055 --> 01:02:18,523
<i>Well, here we are.</i>

727
01:02:18,556 --> 01:02:23,327
Mr. Napier Clark,
looks like, bought it in 1897.

728
01:02:23,361 --> 01:02:26,464
Yeah, that's my grandpa.

729
01:02:26,497 --> 01:02:28,267
Yes, ma'am.

730
01:02:28,299 --> 01:02:30,935
It's never been sold, so,

731
01:02:30,968 --> 01:02:33,871
yes sirree, I reckon
it belongs to you.

732
01:02:33,905 --> 01:02:36,275
Looks like you gotta pay
some back taxes

733
01:02:36,307 --> 01:02:38,143
if you wanna keep it,
Miss Clark.

734
01:02:38,177 --> 01:02:40,545
In fact, ma'am,
the way the law reads,

735
01:02:40,578 --> 01:02:44,283
whoever comes along and pays
those back taxes owns the land,

736
01:02:44,315 --> 01:02:46,818
even if they don't got no deed.

737
01:02:46,851 --> 01:02:48,153
Well, how much?

738
01:02:48,187 --> 01:02:49,921
Looks like about...

739
01:02:54,525 --> 01:02:56,327
Eight hundred dollars total.

740
01:03:13,744 --> 01:03:15,214
<i>Five years.</i>

741
01:03:16,547 --> 01:03:18,050
<i>It had been five years</i>

742
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:20,585
<i>since Tate showed me</i>
<i>this path.</i>

743
01:03:20,618 --> 01:03:23,188
<i>Dear Sir or Madam,</i>

744
01:03:23,222 --> 01:03:25,923
<i>I am sending you</i>
<i>the following pages</i>

745
01:03:25,957 --> 01:03:28,526
<i>on the shells</i>
<i>of the Carolina marsh</i>

746
01:03:28,559 --> 01:03:30,062
<i>for your consideration.</i>

747
01:03:32,964 --> 01:03:36,335
<i>Five years for my heart</i>
<i>to open its shell again.</i>

748
01:03:47,045 --> 01:03:49,881
How's it feel to bask in
the presence of musical genius?

749
01:03:56,988 --> 01:03:58,456
Hey, look.

750
01:04:00,758 --> 01:04:02,027
Oh!

751
01:04:02,060 --> 01:04:04,695
Oh! That's an ornate scallop.

752
01:04:04,729 --> 01:04:06,031
<i>Pecten ornatus.</i>

753
01:04:06,064 --> 01:04:07,165
All right.

754
01:04:08,599 --> 01:04:11,136
Well, it's unusual
to find one here.

755
01:04:11,169 --> 01:04:12,970
Really?
Yeah.

756
01:04:13,005 --> 01:04:15,873
This particular species usually
inhabits regions south of here

757
01:04:15,907 --> 01:04:18,576
'cause these waters
are too cool for them.

758
01:04:20,912 --> 01:04:22,546
What?

759
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,283
Oh, no, it's just, uh,

760
01:04:24,316 --> 01:04:27,319
the Marsh Girl knows
the Latin name for shells

761
01:04:27,352 --> 01:04:29,954
and where they inhabit and why,
for chrissakes.

762
01:04:31,522 --> 01:04:32,857
Here. You keep it.

763
01:04:35,626 --> 01:04:36,827
Thank you.

764
01:04:41,766 --> 01:04:43,701
You're something else,
ain't ya?

765
01:05:07,625 --> 01:05:08,960
I know you think I'm trash,

766
01:05:08,993 --> 01:05:10,362
but I'm worth more
than a picnic.

767
01:05:10,395 --> 01:05:11,762
Oh, no, Kya. Come on.

768
01:05:11,796 --> 01:05:13,165
I'm sorry. No. Hey, come on.

769
01:05:13,198 --> 01:05:15,367
I've never thought
you were trash.

770
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:17,202
Please. I'm sorry.

771
01:05:17,235 --> 01:05:20,138
I understand if you wanna go,
but you can't walk from here.

772
01:05:20,172 --> 01:05:21,706
It's too far.

773
01:05:21,739 --> 01:05:23,342
Can I make it up to you?

774
01:05:25,743 --> 01:05:27,812
Please, can I
make it up to you?

775
01:05:30,315 --> 01:05:32,683
I can't believe you never been
up the fire tower.

776
01:05:32,717 --> 01:05:35,820
Come here when my family's
all in my business. You know?

777
01:05:37,555 --> 01:05:39,991
It's a great way to see
the whole marsh from above.

778
01:05:45,496 --> 01:05:46,764
Here.

779
01:06:11,922 --> 01:06:13,191
What is it?

780
01:06:14,759 --> 01:06:16,927
You can tell me.
I won't laugh at you.

781
01:06:18,397 --> 01:06:21,500
It's like having a friend
your whole life

782
01:06:21,532 --> 01:06:23,368
but you never saw
their full face.

783
01:06:25,770 --> 01:06:26,704
Now I see it.

784
01:06:32,877 --> 01:06:34,979
Your house is over there,
ain't it?

785
01:06:39,084 --> 01:06:40,684
Take me there.

786
01:06:40,718 --> 01:06:43,021
Oh, um...

787
01:06:43,055 --> 01:06:45,457
It's far.
Hey, I like far.

788
01:06:46,957 --> 01:06:48,360
I don't care what it's like,

789
01:06:48,393 --> 01:06:50,262
if that's what
you're worried about.

790
01:06:56,600 --> 01:06:57,935
Is this it right here?

791
01:07:01,006 --> 01:07:03,808
How long you lived out here
by yourself?

792
01:07:03,841 --> 01:07:05,976
About 10 years,
I think.

793
01:07:06,011 --> 01:07:07,645
Neat.

794
01:07:07,678 --> 01:07:10,315
Living out here with no parents
telling you what to do?

795
01:07:12,950 --> 01:07:15,187
There's really nothing
to see inside.

796
01:07:18,356 --> 01:07:20,958
Wow, what you got on the porch?
What?

797
01:07:20,991 --> 01:07:22,993
Oh, um, nothing.

798
01:07:33,771 --> 01:07:35,107
What is all this?

799
01:07:36,308 --> 01:07:37,309
Nothing.

800
01:07:43,881 --> 01:07:46,384
What, you writing a book
or something?

801
01:07:47,852 --> 01:07:49,454
Sort of.

802
01:07:49,488 --> 01:07:52,656
These look straight out
of an encyclopedia.

803
01:07:55,659 --> 01:07:57,229
You're the real deal,
ain't ya?

804
01:08:00,898 --> 01:08:02,601
Ah, swanee.

805
01:08:02,633 --> 01:08:04,336
You got a water pump.

806
01:08:06,304 --> 01:08:07,771
I wasn't ready for guests.

807
01:08:07,805 --> 01:08:09,174
Hey, don't worry.

808
01:08:12,511 --> 01:08:13,878
Hey, there's nobody I know

809
01:08:13,911 --> 01:08:16,381
who could live out here alone
like this.

810
01:08:16,414 --> 01:08:18,749
I mean, most guys
would be too scared.

811
01:08:22,053 --> 01:08:23,221
What do you want with me?

812
01:08:28,326 --> 01:08:31,795
Okay. Look, I'm real sorry
I came on like that.

813
01:08:31,829 --> 01:08:34,533
I wanna get to know you better.
All right?

814
01:08:34,566 --> 01:08:36,034
I think you're gorgeous.

815
01:08:37,502 --> 01:08:40,305
I do. I think you're free
as a dang gale

816
01:08:40,338 --> 01:08:41,506
and smart as a whip.

817
01:08:43,441 --> 01:08:45,676
But I won't do anything
unless you want me to.

818
01:08:47,078 --> 01:08:48,413
How's that?

819
01:08:51,416 --> 01:08:52,517
That's fine.

820
01:08:54,052 --> 01:08:55,253
All right. Heh.

821
01:09:06,565 --> 01:09:10,000
<i>I didn't know</i>
<i>exactly how I felt about Chase.</i>

822
01:09:10,035 --> 01:09:12,604
<i>But I was no longer lonely.</i>

823
01:09:12,637 --> 01:09:13,904
<i>That seemed enough.</i>

824
01:09:16,141 --> 01:09:18,510
Is that for your book?

825
01:09:18,543 --> 01:09:20,412
Yeah.

826
01:09:20,445 --> 01:09:23,415
Anyway, who knows
if anyone will read it.

827
01:09:23,448 --> 01:09:24,382
I will.

828
01:09:25,716 --> 01:09:27,452
<i>The marsh was our secret.</i>

829
01:09:37,596 --> 01:09:38,862
<i>Tell me about your friends.</i>

830
01:09:38,896 --> 01:09:41,399
Oh, I don't really have
any friends.

831
01:09:43,401 --> 01:09:45,303
You always seem to be
having a good time

832
01:09:45,337 --> 01:09:47,838
when you're with them.
You spying on me?

833
01:09:52,943 --> 01:09:54,579
It's funny.
My dad told me once,

834
01:09:54,613 --> 01:09:58,416
he'd had something to drink
and a fight with my mom.

835
01:09:59,817 --> 01:10:02,087
He told me if my friends
really knew me,

836
01:10:02,120 --> 01:10:03,688
they wouldn't be my friends.

837
01:10:05,323 --> 01:10:07,225
I don't know if anyone
really knows me,

838
01:10:07,259 --> 01:10:10,794
is what I'm saying,
I guess.

839
01:10:15,333 --> 01:10:17,135
I wonder
what makes the sky blue.

840
01:10:19,137 --> 01:10:21,273
Blue and violet wavelengths
from sunlight.

841
01:10:22,940 --> 01:10:26,344
They bounce off the gas
particles in the atmosphere

842
01:10:26,378 --> 01:10:27,679
and scatter.

843
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:36,554
Is it okay if I...

844
01:10:37,855 --> 01:10:39,291
kiss you now?

845
01:10:49,801 --> 01:10:52,003
<i>Let's turn to</i>
<i>the red wool fibers</i>

846
01:10:52,038 --> 01:10:54,273
<i>found on Chase Andrews'</i>
<i>denim jacket</i>

847
01:10:54,307 --> 01:10:56,475
the night he died.

848
01:10:56,509 --> 01:10:59,779
Did you compare those samples
to this red ski cap?

849
01:10:59,811 --> 01:11:01,380
Exhibit C.
Yes.

850
01:11:01,414 --> 01:11:04,883
The fibers from the cap
and the jacket matched exactly.

851
01:11:04,916 --> 01:11:06,818
And where was that cap found?

852
01:11:06,851 --> 01:11:09,288
It was found
in Miss Clark's residence.

853
01:11:11,190 --> 01:11:13,326
<i>Now, about these red fibers,</i>

854
01:11:13,359 --> 01:11:15,294
<i>is there any way, doctor,</i>
<i>to determine</i>

855
01:11:15,328 --> 01:11:17,697
<i>how long the fibers</i>
<i>had been on the jacket?</i>

856
01:11:17,730 --> 01:11:21,400
<i>No. We can tell where they</i>
<i>came from, not when.</i>

857
01:11:21,434 --> 01:11:23,636
<i>And if someone</i>
<i>wore this hat often,</i>

858
01:11:23,669 --> 01:11:26,172
<i>is it possible the fibers</i>
<i>would be in their hair</i>

859
01:11:26,205 --> 01:11:28,207
<i>- and on their clothes?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

860
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,676
<i>I would suppose they could.</i>

861
01:11:30,710 --> 01:11:34,380
So would you agree that
at any time during the years

862
01:11:34,413 --> 01:11:37,083
that the defendant,
Miss Clark, knew Chase Andrews,

863
01:11:37,116 --> 01:11:39,652
the fibers of the hat
could have been transferred

864
01:11:39,685 --> 01:11:40,820
onto Chase's jacket?

865
01:11:40,852 --> 01:11:43,422
From what I've seen, yes.

866
01:11:43,456 --> 01:11:47,493
At any time they met.
Yes.

867
01:12:02,575 --> 01:12:07,213
"Dear Miss Clark, we were
fascinated by your manuscript.

868
01:12:07,246 --> 01:12:10,949
If, as you say, your materials
are already complete,

869
01:12:10,982 --> 01:12:14,153
we hope to edit
and publish in record time."

870
01:12:19,924 --> 01:12:23,763
Hey. You're looking at
the new manager of Western Auto.

871
01:12:25,431 --> 01:12:27,466
Oh, Chase.

872
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:28,701
That's great news.

873
01:12:28,734 --> 01:12:30,436
Come on. Let's celebrate.

874
01:12:41,847 --> 01:12:45,718
So they're gonna pay you
for those drawings?

875
01:12:45,751 --> 01:12:47,753
Yeah.

876
01:12:52,658 --> 01:12:54,794
Just don't get too full
of yourself, I guess.

877
01:12:56,028 --> 01:12:57,296
I wouldn't.

878
01:13:01,133 --> 01:13:03,436
I know people
have disappointed you.

879
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:06,272
And I'm sorry for that.

880
01:13:07,773 --> 01:13:09,809
Getting left by your own
family. I mean...

881
01:13:11,143 --> 01:13:12,812
God, my family's
a pain in the ass,

882
01:13:12,845 --> 01:13:15,247
but I don't think
I could take that.

883
01:13:15,281 --> 01:13:19,518
But I want you to know that
I'm gonna take care of you.

884
01:13:19,552 --> 01:13:21,086
Now I've been promoted,

885
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,987
I can get you a nice house
when we're married.

886
01:13:23,022 --> 01:13:25,124
"Married"?
Yeah.

887
01:13:25,157 --> 01:13:28,394
A nice two-story on the beach
with a wraparound veranda.

888
01:13:29,662 --> 01:13:30,796
Yeah.

889
01:13:34,166 --> 01:13:35,835
What about your parents?

890
01:13:35,868 --> 01:13:37,937
Have you told them about me?

891
01:13:37,969 --> 01:13:39,939
What you gotta understand
about my folks

892
01:13:39,971 --> 01:13:43,442
is that if I say you're
my choice, that'd be that.

893
01:13:43,476 --> 01:13:46,212
They'll fall in love with you
when they get to know ya.

894
01:13:50,349 --> 01:13:51,650
Come here.

895
01:13:57,690 --> 01:14:02,328
Oh, by the way, I have to drive
over to Asheville in a few days

896
01:14:02,361 --> 01:14:04,396
to buy goods
for my dad's store.

897
01:14:04,430 --> 01:14:07,032
I was thinking you could come.

898
01:14:07,066 --> 01:14:08,734
Celebrate your book and all.

899
01:14:10,236 --> 01:14:12,371
There'd be lots of people.
It doesn't matter.

900
01:14:12,404 --> 01:14:14,974
You'd be with me.
I know everything.

901
01:14:15,007 --> 01:14:18,577
Hell, you don't have to talk to
one soul if you don't want to.

902
01:14:18,611 --> 01:14:20,145
Come on.
If we're gonna get married,

903
01:14:20,179 --> 01:14:23,048
you need to get out
in the world a bit.

904
01:14:23,082 --> 01:14:25,084
Spread those long wings
of yours.

905
01:14:27,553 --> 01:14:29,455
Come on. It'll be fun.

906
01:14:37,396 --> 01:14:41,267
It's a two-day job,
so we'll stay the night.

907

908

Hey. It's an adventure.
Come on.

910
01:16:36,715 --> 01:16:41,320
It'll feel better for you later,
the more you do it.

911
01:16:42,688 --> 01:16:43,922
Oh.

912
01:16:49,928 --> 01:16:51,830
Hey, I never wanna lose you.

913
01:16:55,668 --> 01:16:58,071
Yeah?
Yeah.

914
01:16:58,104 --> 01:17:00,239
I think about it a lot.

915
01:17:01,774 --> 01:17:04,243
Sneaking out at night

Oh.

925
01:17:49,922 --> 01:17:52,958

<i>So to be clear,</i>
<i>what you're saying</i>

928
01:17:57,730 --> 01:17:59,898
<i>is that the shell necklace</i>

929
01:17:59,932 --> 01:18:03,969
that Chase wore every day
was missing from these items

930
01:18:04,002 --> 01:18:06,405
that law enforcement
recovered from his body

931
01:18:06,438 --> 01:18:08,440
the day that he was found.

932
01:18:08,474 --> 01:18:09,775
Is that correct?

933
01:18:09,808 --> 01:18:12,911
I think it's important.
Yes.

934
01:18:12,945 --> 01:18:16,116
He had that necklace on when he
had dinner with us that night.

935
01:18:17,483 --> 01:18:20,252
And it was gone from his body.

936
01:18:21,687 --> 01:18:24,157
And what I'm saying is
he never took it off.

937
01:18:24,190 --> 01:18:26,291
Whoever killed him took it.

938
01:18:26,325 --> 01:18:29,495
Objection, Your Honor.
It's speculation.

939
01:18:29,528 --> 01:18:31,131
Sustained.

940
01:18:31,164 --> 01:18:32,765
Ladies and gentlemen
of the jury,

941
01:18:32,798 --> 01:18:36,602
you will disregard that
last remark by Mrs. Andrews.

942
01:18:36,635 --> 01:18:41,141
Mrs. Andrews, where did Chase
get this necklace?

943
01:18:41,174 --> 01:18:44,943
- It's from that Marsh Girl.
- Miss Clark.

944
01:18:44,977 --> 01:18:48,380
I didn't even know her name
or if she even had one.

945
01:18:49,882 --> 01:18:51,850
I can't see why Chase...

946
01:18:51,884 --> 01:18:54,486
But what I'm saying is,

947
01:18:54,520 --> 01:18:57,157
she's the only one
who'd have any interest

948
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:58,757
in taking the thing.

949
01:18:58,791 --> 01:19:00,459
Mrs. Andrews...

950
01:19:02,561 --> 01:19:05,531
were Chase and Miss Clark
romantically involved?

951
01:19:05,564 --> 01:19:08,600
- You could say.
- I saw him sneaking out at night.

952
01:19:08,634 --> 01:19:11,037
When I finally asked him
where he was going,

953
01:19:11,070 --> 01:19:13,505
he told me the truth.

954
01:19:13,539 --> 01:19:17,309
I thought:
What would people say?

955
01:19:17,342 --> 01:19:21,880
I was a silly woman to be
worried about that next to...

956
01:19:27,086 --> 01:19:31,523
But he told me
he broke it off with her.

957
01:19:31,557 --> 01:19:35,295
She knew she couldn't have him
anymore, so she killed him

958
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:38,897
- and took back her ugly necklace!
- Objection, Your Honor.

959
01:19:40,933 --> 01:19:42,202
Sustained.

960
01:19:42,235 --> 01:19:44,002
No further questions,
Your Honor.

961
01:19:48,574 --> 01:19:51,844
Mrs. Andrews, you have my
deepest sympathy for your loss.

962
01:19:51,877 --> 01:19:54,546
With all due respect,

963
01:19:54,580 --> 01:20:00,220
you are aware that Miss Clark's
house was thoroughly searched.

964
01:20:00,253 --> 01:20:03,922
And that the police
did not find the necklace there.

965
01:20:03,956 --> 01:20:06,425
Did they?
No.

966
01:20:28,647 --> 01:20:30,549
Hey.

967
01:20:30,582 --> 01:20:32,751
I got it.

968
01:20:32,784 --> 01:20:35,520
- Almost got you.
- Almost knocked me out.

969
01:20:35,554 --> 01:20:37,456
Just trying to show off.

970
01:20:39,058 --> 01:20:41,127
What's that Marsh Girl like
in bed, man?

971
01:20:41,160 --> 01:20:43,129
- Is she an animal?
- Wild as a bobcat

972
01:20:43,162 --> 01:20:45,131
and worth every bit
of the gas money.

973
01:20:45,164 --> 01:20:47,033
Tell me her eyes glow.

974
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:48,800
Only for me
and only when I make them.

975
01:20:48,834 --> 01:20:50,903
Hey, don't talk
about her like that.

976
01:20:50,936 --> 01:20:52,205
What's that?

977
01:20:52,238 --> 01:20:54,274
I said don't talk about her
like that.

978
01:20:54,307 --> 01:20:56,175
Oh, the college boy.

979
01:20:58,244 --> 01:21:00,380
He taught the Marsh Girl
her ABCs.

980
01:21:00,412 --> 01:21:01,480
Oh.
Mm.

981
01:21:01,513 --> 01:21:02,648
You're a waste of her time.

982
01:21:04,683 --> 01:21:06,919
Go ahead, college boy.
What you gonna do?

983
01:21:06,952 --> 01:21:10,256
Come on, you're tough, right?
Come on, let's do something.

984
01:21:10,290 --> 01:21:13,625
You wanna hit me?
Hey, y'all settle down now.

985
01:21:13,659 --> 01:21:14,860
That's enough.

986
01:21:16,762 --> 01:21:19,731
Settle down
before someone get hurt.

987
01:21:19,765 --> 01:21:21,167
There's better ways than this.

988
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,423
Hey, Kya.

989
01:21:45,557 --> 01:21:47,360
Hey, what the hell?

990
01:21:47,393 --> 01:21:49,528
Wait! Kya, wait! Please.

991
01:21:49,561 --> 01:21:50,829
Look, I just wanna talk.

992
01:21:50,862 --> 01:21:52,698
Get out of my lagoon,
you dirty creep!

993
01:21:52,731 --> 01:21:54,599
Kya, please!
I just need to talk to you!

994
01:21:54,633 --> 01:21:56,935
I don't care what you want!

995
01:21:56,969 --> 01:21:59,604
I never wanna see you again.
Ever.

996
01:21:59,638 --> 01:22:01,606
Kya, I need to talk to you
about Chase, okay?

997
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:04,344
About Chase?
He's not good enough for you.

998
01:22:06,045 --> 01:22:08,981
You're the one who left me.

999
01:22:10,682 --> 01:22:12,851
Who didn't come back
when you promised.

1000
01:22:12,884 --> 01:22:15,455
Who never came back.

1001
01:22:15,487 --> 01:22:19,225
You didn't even write
to explain

1002
01:22:19,258 --> 01:22:21,227
or even to say
if you were alive or dead.

1003
01:22:21,260 --> 01:22:22,527
You just disappeared.

1004
01:22:22,561 --> 01:22:24,730
I know.
And I'm so sorry, Kya,

1005
01:22:24,763 --> 01:22:25,964
you have no idea.

1006
01:22:25,998 --> 01:22:29,369
You weren't man enough
to face me.

1007
01:22:30,669 --> 01:22:31,770
You're right, Kya.

1008
01:22:33,072 --> 01:22:35,540
Everything you say is true.

1009
01:22:35,574 --> 01:22:38,077
Leaving you like that was
the worst thing I've ever done,

1010
01:22:38,111 --> 01:22:40,480
the worst thing
I'll ever do in my life.

1011
01:22:40,512 --> 01:22:42,382
I knew how badly I'd hurt you,

1012
01:22:42,415 --> 01:22:44,750
and I couldn't face you,
like you said.

1013
01:22:47,519 --> 01:22:50,423
I thought you wouldn't be able
to leave the marsh

1014
01:22:50,456 --> 01:22:52,924
and live in any other world.

1015
01:22:52,958 --> 01:22:55,827
You know, I thought I had
to choose between you

1016
01:22:55,861 --> 01:22:57,063
and everything else.

1017
01:22:57,096 --> 01:22:58,331
But the truth is, Kya,

1018
01:22:58,364 --> 01:22:59,831
everything else
that I thought mattered,

1019
01:22:59,865 --> 01:23:01,733
the scholarships,
the grants, the jobs,

1020
01:23:01,767 --> 01:23:03,735
it means nothing without you.

1021
01:23:05,637 --> 01:23:07,873
I was so wrong.

1022
01:23:07,906 --> 01:23:09,574
I've been sorry for years.

1023
01:23:12,078 --> 01:23:14,313
And I'll be sorry
for the rest of my life.

1024
01:23:25,158 --> 01:23:26,092
You look...

1025
01:23:38,504 --> 01:23:40,173
I brought you something.

1026
01:23:57,756 --> 01:24:00,992
You know, I'm working
at the new lab near town.

1027
01:24:02,694 --> 01:24:04,163
You'd love it, Kya.

1028
01:24:04,197 --> 01:24:06,965
I get to study all this
under a microscope.

1029
01:24:09,435 --> 01:24:10,869
So I'm here now.

1030
01:24:12,971 --> 01:24:14,440
I'm back for good.

1031
01:24:24,150 --> 01:24:26,519
Kya,
I would do anything to--

1032
01:24:29,355 --> 01:24:31,857
I would've done
so many things differently.

1033
01:24:40,233 --> 01:24:42,201
What do you want now, Tate?

1034
01:24:42,235 --> 01:24:45,304
Is there any way that you
could possibly forgive me, Kya?

1035
01:24:47,340 --> 01:24:48,508
Please?

1036
01:24:51,410 --> 01:24:53,146
I don't know how.

1037
01:25:16,068 --> 01:25:20,206
Kya, I trust you would tell me
if you knew of anyone else

1038
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,874
who had reason to harm
Chase Andrews.

1039
01:25:27,513 --> 01:25:29,981
Well, all right, then.

1040
01:25:30,016 --> 01:25:31,517
Try and get some rest.

1041
01:25:37,956 --> 01:25:39,724
Oh. Hi.

1042
01:25:39,758 --> 01:25:41,927
Hey. What you doing in town?

1043
01:25:41,960 --> 01:25:44,363
I had some good news
from the publisher,

1044
01:25:44,397 --> 01:25:46,365
so I thought
we could celebrate.

1045
01:25:46,399 --> 01:25:48,900
- I was gonna make--
- There he is.

1046
01:25:55,408 --> 01:25:58,211
Kya, you know
Brian, Tina, Pearl.

1047
01:25:58,244 --> 01:26:01,447
You guys know Kya.
Sure, yeah, the Marsh Girl.

1048
01:26:01,480 --> 01:26:03,282
Pleased to meet you, Kya.

1049
01:26:03,316 --> 01:26:06,052
I'm Chase's fiancée.

1050
01:26:07,986 --> 01:26:10,289
All right.
Well, I'll see you around, Kya.

1051
01:26:51,097 --> 01:26:52,164
Kya!

1052
01:26:53,366 --> 01:26:55,268
Hey, Kya. I can explain.

1053
01:26:58,170 --> 01:26:59,438
Are you in there?

1054
01:27:01,340 --> 01:27:02,874
Hey, I just wanna talk.

1055
01:27:04,443 --> 01:27:05,844
Kya!

1056
01:27:08,980 --> 01:27:10,316
I know you're here, damn it!

1057
01:27:16,355 --> 01:27:17,822
Kya!

1058
01:28:11,111 --> 01:28:13,113
<i>I had to do life alone.</i>

1059
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:16,383

01:28:17,883 --> 01:28:19,852

1073
01:29:36,630 --> 01:29:39,065
and I see your book in a shop:

1074
01:29:39,099 --> 01:29:40,667
Catherine Danielle Clark.

1075
01:29:40,700 --> 01:29:45,472
And my heart just broke
and leapt for joy all at once.

1076
01:29:45,505 --> 01:29:48,008
I knew I had to find you.

1077
01:29:48,041 --> 01:29:49,942
I just didn't think
you'd still be here.

1078
01:29:51,044 --> 01:29:53,180
What about the others?

1079
01:29:53,213 --> 01:29:55,749
I don't know a thing
about Murph, Mandy or Missy.

1080
01:29:55,782 --> 01:29:58,785
I wouldn't know them
if I passed them in the street.

1081
01:29:58,819 --> 01:30:00,353
And, um...

1082
01:30:02,355 --> 01:30:03,857
what about Ma?

1083
01:30:06,560 --> 01:30:08,462
Ma passed, Kya.

1084
01:30:16,736 --> 01:30:19,139
Ma had a sister, Rosemary.

1085
01:30:19,172 --> 01:30:22,108
She found me in the Army
and told me what happened.

1086
01:30:22,142 --> 01:30:25,378
Showed up at Rosemary's door
in her alligator shoes.

1087
01:30:25,412 --> 01:30:28,114
Rosemary said
she didn't talk for months.

1088
01:30:28,148 --> 01:30:31,551
And then about a year later,
she remembered she had children.

1089
01:30:31,585 --> 01:30:33,220
Rosemary helped her
write a letter to Pa,

1090
01:30:33,253 --> 01:30:36,022
asking if she
could come get us.

1091
01:30:36,056 --> 01:30:38,892
And he told her if she ever
so much as contacted us again,

1092
01:30:38,925 --> 01:30:40,494
he'd beat us unrecognizable.

1093
01:30:42,062 --> 01:30:43,663
Yeah, sounds like Pa.

1094
01:30:43,697 --> 01:30:46,166
She saved up for lawyers
and everything,

1095
01:30:46,199 --> 01:30:48,401
but then she got sick.

1096
01:30:48,435 --> 01:30:50,337
Leukemia.

1097
01:30:50,370 --> 01:30:51,404
She tried, but--

1098
01:30:51,438 --> 01:30:53,073
She never had a chance.

1099
01:30:56,109 --> 01:30:58,144
I've been waiting...

1100
01:30:58,178 --> 01:31:00,680
all these years
for her to walk down the lane.

1101
01:31:02,415 --> 01:31:05,652
You didn't have a family
your whole life,

1102
01:31:05,685 --> 01:31:09,022
and there's nothing I can do
to give you that back.

1103
01:31:09,055 --> 01:31:13,126
But I'd like to come see you
as much as I can get up here.

1104
01:31:18,031 --> 01:31:19,566
Yeah, I'd like that.

1105
01:31:56,803 --> 01:31:58,471
<i>Mabel's gonna be so proud.</i>

1106
01:31:58,505 --> 01:32:00,140
Just one more thing.

1107
01:32:02,576 --> 01:32:04,411
I'll be sure he gets it.

1108
01:32:05,645 --> 01:32:06,980
Thank you, Jumpin'.

1109
01:32:11,818 --> 01:32:13,119
How y'all doing?

1110
01:32:13,153 --> 01:32:16,057
One pack of your finest,
please, sir.

1111
01:32:16,089 --> 01:32:17,624
And give me some matches.

1112
01:32:17,657 --> 01:32:19,726
- Sure thing.
- "Sure thing."

1113
01:32:21,194 --> 01:32:22,929
Kya Clark.

1114
01:32:22,963 --> 01:32:25,298
Miss Catherine Danielle Clark.

1115
01:32:25,332 --> 01:32:27,267
You wrote a damn book.
Come here.

1116
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,269
Wait, wait, wait.
I wanna talk to you.

1117
01:32:29,302 --> 01:32:32,073
Don't act like that. Come on.

1118
01:32:32,105 --> 01:32:33,506
Leave me alone.

1119
01:32:36,010 --> 01:32:38,979
Damn, the Marsh Girl thinks
she's too good for you now.

1120
01:32:39,013 --> 01:32:40,580
Shut up!

1121
01:32:40,614 --> 01:32:42,849
Here you go, sir.
It's on the house.

1122
01:32:52,359 --> 01:32:53,994
Thought I might find you here.

1123
01:32:55,328 --> 01:32:56,763
I told you to leave me alone.

1124
01:32:56,796 --> 01:32:58,264
No, I know, but I just--

1125
01:32:58,298 --> 01:33:00,266
Listen, I wanted
to say I'm sorry.

1126
01:33:00,300 --> 01:33:04,704
Really. I feel bad about
how things turned out.

1127
01:33:04,738 --> 01:33:06,373
"How things turned out"?

1128
01:33:07,841 --> 01:33:09,509
What, you mean
how it turned out

1129
01:33:09,542 --> 01:33:12,879
you were engaged the whole time
we were together?

1130
01:33:12,912 --> 01:33:16,549
How it turned out
that you lie to everybody?

1131
01:33:16,583 --> 01:33:19,152
Kya, I have to do things I don't
wanna do. You know that.

1132
01:33:19,185 --> 01:33:22,322
No, I have to get married
to someone like Pearl. I had to.

1133
01:33:22,355 --> 01:33:24,257
But you're the one
I really want.

1134
01:33:28,495 --> 01:33:31,498
You know any other man
would have tried to change you?

1135
01:33:31,531 --> 01:33:32,832
To fix you?

1136
01:33:34,000 --> 01:33:35,435
I never did.

1137
01:33:36,703 --> 01:33:38,171
No, no. Please, please, wait.

1138
01:33:38,204 --> 01:33:40,974
I need you. I really need you.

1139
01:33:41,008 --> 01:33:43,576
Don't leave me all alone
in that place.

1140
01:33:43,610 --> 01:33:45,211
You know, nobody else knows me.

1141
01:33:49,716 --> 01:33:51,751
You know,
I feel sorry for you.

1142
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:55,855
But I want nothing to do
with any of that.

1143
01:34:10,104 --> 01:34:11,471
Wilder than ever.

1144
01:34:15,442 --> 01:34:17,011
I know you want this too.

1145
01:34:17,044 --> 01:34:19,245
Stop!
I know you want this too.

1146
01:34:24,651 --> 01:34:26,686
You're mine, Kya.
You belong to me.

1147
01:34:26,720 --> 01:34:28,488
I'm not letting you go
this time.

1148
01:34:48,641 --> 01:34:50,810
Leave me alone, you bastard!

1149
01:34:52,179 --> 01:34:55,949
You bother me again
and I'll kill you!

1150
01:34:55,982 --> 01:34:58,152
<i>She shouted it real loud, sir.</i>

1151
01:34:58,185 --> 01:35:00,286
<i>I heard a commotion,</i>
<i>and I come closer,</i>

1152
01:35:00,320 --> 01:35:03,490
see if anybody was in trouble,
and there she was.

1153
01:35:03,523 --> 01:35:06,259
And do you recognize the woman?

1154
01:35:06,292 --> 01:35:09,829
Is she in the courtroom today?

1155
01:35:09,863 --> 01:35:12,233
Yes, that one there.
The defendant.

1156
01:35:12,265 --> 01:35:14,634
The one folks call Marsh Girl.

1157
01:35:20,174 --> 01:35:22,976
<i>I finally understood</i>
<i>why Ma had to leave.</i>

1158
01:36:29,843 --> 01:36:32,146
<i>One thing I learned from Pa,</i>

1159
01:36:32,179 --> 01:36:34,681
<i>these men have to have</i>
<i>the last punch.</i>

1160
01:37:02,309 --> 01:37:05,212
<i>Being isolated was one thing.</i>

1161
01:37:05,246 --> 01:37:08,381
<i>Living in fear, quite another.</i>

1162
01:37:10,150 --> 01:37:13,254
<i>I will never live like that.</i>

1163
01:37:13,287 --> 01:37:17,258
<i>A life wondering</i>
<i>when the next fist will fall.</i>

1164
01:37:39,179 --> 01:37:41,048
Tate, you can't be here.

1165
01:37:41,081 --> 01:37:42,649
I just wanted to check on you.

1166
01:37:42,682 --> 01:37:43,983
Jumpin' said he hadn't
seen you since--

1167
01:37:44,018 --> 01:37:45,085
Not now.

1168
01:37:46,786 --> 01:37:49,123
Kya, what happened
to your face?

1169
01:37:49,156 --> 01:37:51,724
Was it Chase?
Tell me, Kya. Did he do this?

1170
01:37:51,758 --> 01:37:53,426
I need you to stay out of it.

1171
01:37:53,459 --> 01:37:55,561
That son of a bitch.

1172
01:37:55,595 --> 01:37:58,399
That son of a bitch.
Tate, I need you to go.

1173
01:37:58,431 --> 01:37:59,632
Kya.

1174
01:38:06,273 --> 01:38:08,775
You know, I was gonna go
to Greenville next week.

1175
01:38:11,611 --> 01:38:13,314
Finally meet my publishers.

1176
01:38:15,448 --> 01:38:17,617
Talk about the next book.

1177
01:38:17,650 --> 01:38:19,452
I was feeling brave enough.

1178
01:38:19,485 --> 01:38:21,155
Well, you can still go.

1179
01:38:21,188 --> 01:38:22,822
Looking like this?

1180
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:25,692
Don't let him ruin this
for you.

1181
01:38:25,725 --> 01:38:27,794
Go to Greenville.

1182
01:38:27,827 --> 01:38:29,495
Okay? There's a bus.

1183
01:38:29,529 --> 01:38:32,166
It's easy.
Jumpin's got the schedule.

1184
01:38:32,199 --> 01:38:34,634
Let them put you up
in a nice hotel,

1185
01:38:34,667 --> 01:38:36,936
eat some hot restaurant food
you didn't have to make.

1186
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:39,806
Stay a week, if you can.

1187
01:38:39,839 --> 01:38:43,710
And I'll come see you
when you're back. Okay?

1188
01:38:43,743 --> 01:38:46,347
Hear how it all went
with the publishers.

1189
01:38:46,380 --> 01:38:47,814
All right.

1190
01:38:55,055 --> 01:38:56,256
Hey, you cold?

1191
01:38:57,857 --> 01:39:00,827
I'm fine. I don't need you
to take care of me.

1192
01:39:00,860 --> 01:39:02,795
I know, but just take my hat.

1193
01:39:02,829 --> 01:39:05,565
I said I don't need your help.
Just take it.

1194
01:39:34,361 --> 01:39:36,863
<i>You wanna tell me</i>
<i>what happened to your eye?</i>

1195
01:39:38,232 --> 01:39:40,367
I need to write down
the bus schedule.

1196
01:39:40,401 --> 01:39:42,202
You have a copy, right?

1197
01:39:47,374 --> 01:39:50,110
It was that Chase,
wasn't it?

1198
01:39:52,712 --> 01:39:54,081
Kya, look at me.

1199
01:39:57,117 --> 01:39:58,985
Now you tell me
what he did.

1200
01:40:01,321 --> 01:40:02,588
I can't say it.

1201
01:40:04,224 --> 01:40:06,060
It's over now.

1202
01:40:06,093 --> 01:40:07,927
I just want it out of my life.

1203
01:40:07,960 --> 01:40:11,098
And how you know he ain't
coming after you again?

1204
01:40:11,131 --> 01:40:12,965
You're all by your lonesome
out there.

1205
01:40:12,999 --> 01:40:14,334
Jumpin', please.

1206
01:40:15,502 --> 01:40:17,371
You can't tell anybody.

1207
01:40:17,404 --> 01:40:19,206
You know how it is.

1208
01:40:19,239 --> 01:40:21,908
They'd drag me
into the sheriff's office

1209
01:40:21,941 --> 01:40:25,645
and make me describe it
to a bunch of men.

1210
01:40:25,678 --> 01:40:27,613
And then write me up
in the papers,

1211
01:40:27,647 --> 01:40:29,982
accusing me of whoring.

1212
01:40:30,017 --> 01:40:33,120
Or trying to get money
out of his parents.

1213
01:40:33,153 --> 01:40:34,887
Okay?
They'd do nothing about it.

1214
01:40:34,921 --> 01:40:35,922
You're right, Kya.

1215
01:40:38,525 --> 01:40:41,328
And I ain't gonna do anything
to make this thing worse.

1216
01:40:43,263 --> 01:40:46,567
But you let me know
when you're coming and going.

1217
01:40:46,599 --> 01:40:48,435
You hear?

1218
01:40:48,469 --> 01:40:50,504
I gotta know
if you're out of town.

1219
01:40:53,773 --> 01:40:56,876
'Cause if I don't see you
for a while...

1220
01:41:02,216 --> 01:41:03,550
Thank you, Jumpin'.

1221
01:41:04,717 --> 01:41:06,520
I'm leaving in a few days.

1222
01:41:07,887 --> 01:41:09,689
I'll come see you
as soon as I'm back.

1223
01:41:12,059 --> 01:41:14,161
Okay, that's good.

1224
01:41:14,194 --> 01:41:15,529
That's good.

1225
01:41:18,398 --> 01:41:20,101
<i>Miss Price, would you tell us</i>

1226
01:41:20,133 --> 01:41:22,870
<i>what you saw</i>
<i>on the morning of October 29?</i>

1227
01:41:22,903 --> 01:41:24,939
I saw the Marsh Girl...

1228
01:41:24,972 --> 01:41:27,808
Miss Clark, that is. Pardon me.
...get on the 9:00 bus.

1229
01:41:27,842 --> 01:41:29,810
Well, you've got
quite a good memory.

1230
01:41:29,844 --> 01:41:30,945
We all talked about it.

1231
01:41:30,978 --> 01:41:32,046
<i>We'd never seen her</i>

1232
01:41:32,079 --> 01:41:33,480
<i>all cleaned up like that.</i>

1233
01:41:33,514 --> 01:41:35,650
<i>Hair combed, makeup.</i>

1234
01:41:35,683 --> 01:41:40,054
<i>Just to be clear,</i>
<i>on the morning of October 29,</i>

1235
01:41:40,087 --> 01:41:43,289
<i>you and several others</i>
<i>saw Miss Clark</i>

1236
01:41:43,323 --> 01:41:46,861
<i>board the 9 a.m. bus</i>
<i>and leave Barkley Cove.</i>

1237
01:41:46,894 --> 01:41:48,896
Yes, that's right.
Thank you, Miss Price.

1238
01:41:48,929 --> 01:41:50,631
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1239
01:41:50,665 --> 01:41:53,400
Miss Price,
is the Piggly Wiggly open

1240
01:41:53,433 --> 01:41:55,201
at 1:30 in the morning?

1241
01:41:55,235 --> 01:41:56,904
No, sir.

1242
01:41:58,039 --> 01:42:00,206
Well, the reason I ask is,

1243
01:42:00,240 --> 01:42:01,909
you couldn't have seen
who got off

1244
01:42:01,942 --> 01:42:03,911
the night bus
from Greenville,

1245
01:42:03,944 --> 01:42:06,714
nor could you have seen
who got on the 2:30 a.m. bus

1246
01:42:06,747 --> 01:42:10,350
from Barkley Cove
back to Greenville, could you?

1247
01:42:10,383 --> 01:42:12,086
Well, no. Of course not.

1248
01:42:12,119 --> 01:42:14,689
So after you saw Miss Clark

1249
01:42:14,722 --> 01:42:17,124
board that morning bus
to Greenville...

1250
01:42:18,759 --> 01:42:21,562
she could have returned
to Barkley Cove that night

1251
01:42:21,595 --> 01:42:23,698
and been back in Greenville
for breakfast,

1252
01:42:23,731 --> 01:42:26,266
all without you
taking notice.

1253
01:42:26,299 --> 01:42:28,002
<i>My name is Robert Foster.</i>

1254
01:42:28,035 --> 01:42:31,172
I'm a senior editor at Harrison
Morris Publishing Company

1255
01:42:31,204 --> 01:42:34,075
- in Boston, Massachusetts.
- Mr. Foster, you sat down

1256
01:42:34,108 --> 01:42:36,711
for dinner with Miss Clark
at 7 p.m.

1257
01:42:36,744 --> 01:42:38,846
on the night of October 29.

1258
01:42:38,879 --> 01:42:40,213
Correct?
Yes.

1259
01:42:40,246 --> 01:42:42,282
What was
your first impression of her?

1260
01:42:43,718 --> 01:42:45,052
My first impression was

1261
01:42:45,086 --> 01:42:50,057
that she was very shy,
very gentle, very smart.

1262
01:42:50,091 --> 01:42:52,193
I knew that she was
something of a recluse,

1263
01:42:52,225 --> 01:42:55,129
but I also knew that
she was a gifted naturalist.

1264
01:42:55,162 --> 01:42:56,764
<i>How long did that dinner go on?</i>

1265
01:42:56,797 --> 01:42:58,199
<i>At least a few hours.</i>

1266
01:42:58,231 --> 01:42:59,967
Some female insects
do eat their mates.

1267
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:03,269
Fireflies, in fact, have
two different light signals.

1268
01:43:03,303 --> 01:43:04,471
One for mating,

1269
01:43:04,504 --> 01:43:05,806
and one to attract a male

1270
01:43:05,840 --> 01:43:07,575
in order to make him
her next meal.

1271
01:43:07,608 --> 01:43:09,309
- So she eats him?
- How gruesome.

1272
01:43:09,342 --> 01:43:10,477
Oh, dear.

1273
01:43:10,511 --> 01:43:12,278
I must spend less time
with insects.

1274
01:43:12,312 --> 01:43:14,582
- It's quite amoral.
- Amoral, indeed.

1275
01:43:14,615 --> 01:43:17,017
I don't know if there is
a dark side to nature.

1276
01:43:18,686 --> 01:43:21,555
Just inventive ways
to endure.

1277
01:43:21,589 --> 01:43:23,090
Against all odds.

1278
01:43:23,124 --> 01:43:25,159
<i>And when you met</i>
<i>with Miss Clark</i>

1279
01:43:25,192 --> 01:43:27,595
the following morning,
October 30th,

1280
01:43:27,628 --> 01:43:31,632
was there anything unusual about
her appearance or her demeanor?

1281
01:43:31,665 --> 01:43:33,433
Not at all.

1282
01:43:33,466 --> 01:43:35,236
No further questions,
Your Honor.

1283
01:43:35,268 --> 01:43:38,773
Mr. Foster, did Miss Clark
stay at the same hotel

1284
01:43:38,806 --> 01:43:40,440
as you and your colleagues?

1285
01:43:40,473 --> 01:43:43,144
No. She preferred
a smaller hotel.

1286
01:43:43,177 --> 01:43:45,780
The, um, Mountain something.

1287
01:43:45,813 --> 01:43:49,116
Could you look at this map
of Greenville for me, please?

1288
01:43:49,150 --> 01:43:51,852
I think you'll see The Piedmont,

1289
01:43:51,886 --> 01:43:53,788
where you
and your colleagues stayed,

1290
01:43:53,821 --> 01:43:57,858
and then The Three Mountains
Hotel, where Miss Clark stayed.

1291
01:43:57,892 --> 01:44:01,361
Could you tell me which one
is closest to the bus station?

1292
01:44:03,063 --> 01:44:05,533
The Three Mountains Hotel
is closer.

1293
01:44:05,566 --> 01:44:09,270
In fact, The Three Mountains
is the closest hotel

1294
01:44:09,302 --> 01:44:12,673
to the Greenville bus station.
Is that correct?

1295
01:44:12,706 --> 01:44:15,543
Looks that way.
No further questions.

1296
01:44:15,576 --> 01:44:18,311
<i>I don't think a good lawyer</i>

1297
01:44:18,344 --> 01:44:20,047
ever puts their client
on the stand,

1298
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,348
but this might help you.

1299
01:44:22,382 --> 01:44:26,587
For the jury to be able
to hear from you, directly.

1300
01:44:27,922 --> 01:44:30,925
For them to be able
to see you...

1301
01:44:32,526 --> 01:44:34,995
as the kind and thoughtful
person you truly are.

1302
01:44:35,029 --> 01:44:36,831
They're never gonna see me
like that.

1303
01:44:36,864 --> 01:44:39,200
Listen. I know you have
a world of reasons

1304
01:44:39,233 --> 01:44:41,735
to hate these people--
No, I never hated them.

1305
01:44:41,769 --> 01:44:43,237
They hated me.

1306
01:44:44,605 --> 01:44:48,341
They laughed at me.
They left me.

1307
01:44:48,374 --> 01:44:50,811
They harassed me.
They attacked me.

1308
01:44:50,845 --> 01:44:54,315
You want me to beg for my life?

1309
01:44:54,347 --> 01:44:56,150
I don't have it in me.

1310
01:44:56,183 --> 01:44:57,718
I won't.

1311
01:44:59,553 --> 01:45:02,189
I will not offer myself up.

1312
01:45:02,223 --> 01:45:03,891
They can make their decision.

1313
01:45:06,227 --> 01:45:10,097
But they're not deciding
anything about me.

1314
01:45:11,866 --> 01:45:13,200
It's them.

1315
01:45:14,802 --> 01:45:16,570
They're judging themselves.

1316
01:45:19,039 --> 01:45:20,307
All right, then.

1317
01:45:21,542 --> 01:45:22,710
Mm.

1318
01:45:27,548 --> 01:45:30,651
Mr. Milton, you have always
been kind to me.

1319
01:45:32,219 --> 01:45:33,587
Even as a child.

1320
01:45:35,256 --> 01:45:36,724
I never forgot.

1321
01:45:46,634 --> 01:45:50,403
<i>His life was cut short</i>
<i>by the jilted lover</i>

1322
01:45:50,436 --> 01:45:54,141
<i>who could not accept that</i>
<i>he had returned to the fold.</i>

1323
01:45:54,174 --> 01:45:58,712
<i>A witness saw Miss Clark</i>
<i>and Chase in the marsh.</i>

1324
01:45:58,746 --> 01:46:02,049
<i>Heard her say the words</i>
<i>"I'll kill you."</i>

1325
01:46:02,082 --> 01:46:03,449
<i>And what's more,</i>

1326
01:46:03,483 --> 01:46:05,485
<i>is there's physical evidence</i>

1327
01:46:05,519 --> 01:46:07,821
<i>from that night</i>
<i>connecting them.</i>

1328
01:46:07,855 --> 01:46:11,825
<i>Fibers from her red wool cap</i>

1329
01:46:11,859 --> 01:46:13,794
<i>left on his denim jacket.</i>

1330
01:46:13,827 --> 01:46:15,663
Dad, I'm going over
to deal with it.

1331
01:46:15,696 --> 01:46:18,699
<i>Who else would have motive</i>
<i>to take that shell necklace?</i>

1332
01:46:20,500 --> 01:46:23,070
You can, and you must,

1333
01:46:23,103 --> 01:46:28,108
find that the defendant is
guilty of first-degree murder.

1334
01:46:37,483 --> 01:46:38,819
Mr. Milton.

1335
01:46:54,368 --> 01:46:59,673
I have lived
in Barkley Cove my whole life.

1336
01:46:59,707 --> 01:47:03,811
And like you,
I heard the tall tales

1337
01:47:03,844 --> 01:47:06,280
told about the Marsh Girl.

1338
01:47:06,313 --> 01:47:08,649
That she was part wolf.

1339
01:47:08,682 --> 01:47:12,820
A missing link
between ape and man.

1340
01:47:12,853 --> 01:47:15,255
That her eyes
glowed in the dark.

1341
01:47:17,057 --> 01:47:19,827
Well, here she is.

1342
01:47:19,860 --> 01:47:24,631
The reality is that
she was an abandoned child.

1343
01:47:24,665 --> 01:47:29,203
A little girl surviving out
there in the marsh on her own,

1344
01:47:29,236 --> 01:47:31,772
reviled and shunned.

1345
01:47:34,842 --> 01:47:38,312
Mr. James Madison
and his wife, Mabel,

1346
01:47:38,345 --> 01:47:40,647
they are sitting here
in the courtroom today.

1347
01:47:40,681 --> 01:47:42,850
They're about the only people
in this town

1348
01:47:42,883 --> 01:47:44,651
who showed her any care.

1349
01:47:44,685 --> 01:47:46,220
The rest of us...

1350
01:47:48,522 --> 01:47:50,290
Well, I'm ashamed to say

1351
01:47:51,625 --> 01:47:54,094
that we labeled her
and rejected her

1352
01:47:54,128 --> 01:47:57,831
because we thought
she was different.

1353
01:47:57,865 --> 01:47:59,299
And now...

1354
01:48:01,068 --> 01:48:04,872
the job of judging this shy
and rejected young woman

1355
01:48:04,905 --> 01:48:07,541
has fallen on your shoulders.

1356
01:48:07,574 --> 01:48:09,877
But you must base your judgment

1357
01:48:09,910 --> 01:48:13,047
on the facts presented
in this courtroom,

1358
01:48:13,080 --> 01:48:16,750
and not on the rumors
and feelings

1359
01:48:16,784 --> 01:48:19,219
from the past 25 years.

1360
01:48:19,253 --> 01:48:22,222
Miss Clark has a solid alibi.

1361
01:48:22,256 --> 01:48:25,626
She was in Greenville
the night Chase Andrews died.

1362
01:48:25,659 --> 01:48:30,731
And what facts,
exactly, stand against her?

1363
01:48:32,332 --> 01:48:34,201
The State has not proven

1364
01:48:34,234 --> 01:48:37,371
that this incident
was indeed a murder,

1365
01:48:37,404 --> 01:48:41,375
and not just some
tragic accident.

1366
01:48:41,408 --> 01:48:43,610
The State wants you to believe

1367
01:48:43,644 --> 01:48:45,245
that at 11:30 at night,

1368
01:48:45,279 --> 01:48:47,881
without a single witness
seeing her,

1369
01:48:47,915 --> 01:48:51,318
she caught the last bus from
Greenville to Barkley Cove,

1370
01:48:51,351 --> 01:48:54,054
and rode that bus disguised,

1371
01:48:54,088 --> 01:48:56,256
since neither of
the bus drivers that night

1372
01:48:56,290 --> 01:48:58,492
could identify her
as a passenger,

1373
01:48:58,526 --> 01:49:00,661
all the way back
to Barkley Cove.

1374
01:49:00,694 --> 01:49:04,532
And then,
in less than an hour...

1375
01:49:06,266 --> 01:49:09,069
she tracks down Chase Andrews
in the middle of the night,

1376
01:49:09,103 --> 01:49:11,638
lures him to the tower,
murders him,

1377
01:49:11,672 --> 01:49:13,807
wipes away
all physical evidence,

1378
01:49:13,841 --> 01:49:18,779
and somehow catches the 2:30
a.m. bus back to Greenville.

1379
01:49:18,812 --> 01:49:21,348
Again, without
a single witness seeing her.

1380
01:49:21,381 --> 01:49:23,951
And after doing all that,

1381
01:49:25,652 --> 01:49:29,591
she meets with her publishers
the next morning, unruffled.

1382
01:49:29,623 --> 01:49:31,925
Now, these are not facts.

1383
01:49:31,959 --> 01:49:34,828
These are just more
of the rumors

1384
01:49:34,862 --> 01:49:37,131
and tall tales
that we have been spreading

1385
01:49:37,164 --> 01:49:41,034
about Miss Clark
her entire life.

1386
01:49:41,068 --> 01:49:45,105
I believe you will come to
a judgment based on the facts,

1387
01:49:45,139 --> 01:49:48,475
and not the gossip
that you have heard for years.

1388
01:49:49,544 --> 01:49:52,880
It's time, at last,

1389
01:49:52,913 --> 01:49:57,151
for all of us to be fair
to the Marsh Girl.

1390
01:49:59,219 --> 01:50:01,523
Maybe you should go home
and do your waiting there.

1391
01:50:01,556 --> 01:50:04,191
Six hours already. How long
do you think they'll take?

1392
01:50:04,224 --> 01:50:06,660
Well, let's hope they take
a good long while.

1393
01:50:06,693 --> 01:50:10,532
If a few jurors have doubts,
we got a chance.

1394
01:50:25,279 --> 01:50:29,149
Mr. Foreman, is it correct that
the jury has reached a verdict?

1395
01:50:29,183 --> 01:50:30,552
We have, Your Honor.

1396
01:50:44,599 --> 01:50:48,769
The defendant will please rise
for the reading of the verdict.

1397
01:50:53,541 --> 01:50:54,741
Stand up.

1398
01:51:04,586 --> 01:51:07,020
"We, the jury,
find the defendant,

1399
01:51:07,054 --> 01:51:10,190
Catherine Danielle Clark...

1400
01:51:10,224 --> 01:51:13,595
not guilty
of first-degree murder

1401
01:51:13,628 --> 01:51:15,697
of Mr. Chase Andrews."

1402
01:51:21,902 --> 01:51:24,304
Miss Clark, you are free to go.

1403
01:51:24,338 --> 01:51:26,541
And I apologize,
on behalf of the State,

1404
01:51:26,574 --> 01:51:28,308
for the time
that you have served.

1405
01:51:28,342 --> 01:51:30,077
This court is dismissed.

1406
01:51:34,348 --> 01:51:35,650
Thank you.

1407
01:51:41,522 --> 01:51:42,557
Come here.

1408
01:51:45,025 --> 01:51:48,395
You're okay.
You're all right.

1409
01:51:48,428 --> 01:51:50,998
You just forget
about this nonsense.

1410
01:51:51,031 --> 01:51:53,166
We're looking forward
to the next book.

1411
01:52:08,015 --> 01:52:09,617
Can you take me home?

1412
01:52:57,732 --> 01:52:59,667
<i>Now I can finally admit.</i>

1413
01:53:00,834 --> 01:53:03,170
<i>All the months in isolation,</i>

1414
01:53:03,203 --> 01:53:05,839
<i>yearning to be back</i>
<i>in the marsh,</i>

1415
01:53:05,872 --> 01:53:09,644
<i>it was knowing</i>
<i>how much was left to explore,</i>

1416
01:53:09,677 --> 01:53:12,179
<i>how much life</i>
<i>to uncover in the wild,</i>

1417
01:53:12,212 --> 01:53:13,347
<i>that kept me going.</i>

1418
01:53:15,616 --> 01:53:17,685
<i>And the hope,</i>

1419
01:53:17,719 --> 01:53:19,186
<i>always that hope...</i>

1420
01:53:20,688 --> 01:53:22,724
<i>that one day</i>
<i>I could share it...</i>

1421
01:53:25,025 --> 01:53:27,961
<i>with the only person</i>
<i>I had ever truly loved.</i>

1422
01:53:58,492 --> 01:53:59,727
Kya!

1423
01:54:01,128 --> 01:54:02,262
Kya.

1424
01:54:17,944 --> 01:54:19,614
Hey.

1425
01:54:19,647 --> 01:54:21,348
You know I love you, right?

1426
01:55:25,213 --> 01:55:26,880
What?

1427
01:55:26,914 --> 01:55:27,948
Will you, uh--?

1428
01:55:27,982 --> 01:55:29,817
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1429
01:55:32,553 --> 01:55:33,988
Will you marry me?

1430
01:55:35,390 --> 01:55:37,058
I mean, do you want to?

1431
01:55:40,362 --> 01:55:41,895
Well, aren't we already?

1432
01:55:43,530 --> 01:55:44,832
Like geese?

1433
01:55:47,668 --> 01:55:50,138
I can live with that,
I guess.

1434
01:55:52,006 --> 01:55:52,973
Come here.

1435
01:56:05,120 --> 01:56:07,188
Oh, here we go.

1436
01:56:07,222 --> 01:56:08,189
Hey.

1437
01:56:08,223 --> 01:56:10,225
Hey, you. Hi, there.

1438
01:56:16,297 --> 01:56:17,898
Come here, baby girl.

1439
01:56:19,933 --> 01:56:22,137
He loved you so much.

1440
01:56:32,447 --> 01:56:34,416
Kya. Look at that.

1441
01:56:34,449 --> 01:56:37,085
You see that up there?
On the elbow of that branch?

1442
01:56:39,087 --> 01:56:42,257
When's the last time
we saw one of those?

1443
01:56:42,290 --> 01:56:43,724
I know.

1444
01:56:47,828 --> 01:56:49,130
This book's pretty good.

1445
01:56:49,164 --> 01:56:50,831
This guy's still talking
about...

1446
01:57:04,912 --> 01:57:06,980
<i>I hope when it is time</i>
<i>for me to leave,</i>

1447
01:57:07,015 --> 01:57:10,151
<i>I will go quick and easy,</i>
<i>without making too much noise.</i>

1448
01:57:31,139 --> 01:57:32,806
Ma!

1449
01:57:32,840 --> 01:57:34,109
Ma.

1450
01:57:38,879 --> 01:57:40,014
Ma.

1451
01:57:41,782 --> 01:57:43,418
<i>Kya?</i>

1452
01:57:43,451 --> 01:57:44,651
Kya!

1453
01:58:22,524 --> 01:58:25,126
<i>It has always been enough...</i>

1454
01:58:25,160 --> 01:58:27,928
<i>to be part of the natural</i>
<i>sequence of things.</i>

1455
01:58:29,364 --> 01:58:31,466
<i>Sure as the tides.</i>

1456
01:58:31,499 --> 01:58:33,067
<i>Nature my guide.</i>

1457
01:58:37,605 --> 01:58:39,873
<i>The marsh knows</i>
<i>all about death...</i>

1458
01:58:42,544 --> 01:58:45,679
<i>and doesn't necessarily</i>
<i>define it as tragedy.</i>

1459
01:58:45,712 --> 01:58:47,781
<i>Certainly not a sin.</i>

1460
01:58:49,517 --> 01:58:51,519
<i>It understands</i>
<i>that every creature</i>

1461
01:58:51,553 --> 01:58:53,754
<i>does what it must to survive.</i>

1462
01:58:56,224 --> 01:59:00,528
<i>And that sometimes,</i>
<i>for prey to live...</i>

1463
01:59:00,562 --> 01:59:02,397
<i>its predator must die.</i>

1464
01:59:30,558 --> 01:59:32,126
<i>I am the marsh now.</i>

1465
01:59:34,062 --> 01:59:36,297
<i>I am the feather of an egret.</i>

1466
01:59:36,331 --> 01:59:39,733
<i>I am every shell</i>
<i>washed upon the shore.</i>

1467
01:59:43,238 --> 01:59:45,139
<i>I am a firefly.</i>

1468
01:59:45,173 --> 01:59:46,940
<i>You'll see hundreds</i>

1469
01:59:46,974 --> 01:59:50,078
<i>beckoning far into the dark</i>
<i>reaches of the marsh.</i>

1470
01:59:50,111 --> 01:59:53,414
<i>And that's where you will</i>
<i>always find me.</i>

1471
01:59:53,448 --> 01:59:55,416
<i>Way out yonder.</i>

1472
01:59:55,450 --> 01:59:57,318
<i>Where the crawdads sing.</i>
