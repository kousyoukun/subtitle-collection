1
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,904
<i> There are five laws to
create something from nothing.</i>

2
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:47,739
- One.
<i>-  Distribute being</i>.

3
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,708
<i>A single honeybee
has a memory of six days,</i>

4
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,910
<i>a hive a memory of three months.</i>

5
00:01:53,114 --> 00:01:54,346
Two.

6
00:01:54,348 --> 00:01:56,381
<i> Accept your errors.</i>

7
00:01:56,383 --> 00:01:58,717
<i>Innovation is
indistinguishable from failing.</i>

8
00:02:00,654 --> 00:02:04,656
- Three.
<i>-  Inherit the wind. Cause unrest and invite chaos.</i>

9
00:02:06,594 --> 00:02:09,128
- Four.
<i>-  Sacrifice form for function.</i>

10
00:02:10,498 --> 00:02:12,297
<i>If it works, it's beautiful.</i>

11
00:02:19,507 --> 00:02:21,840
- Five.
<i>-  Yield increasing returns.</i>

12
00:02:21,842 --> 00:02:23,842
<i>To those who have,
more will be given.</i>

13
00:02:44,765 --> 00:02:45,898
What?

14
00:03:44,024 --> 00:03:47,426
- I love your
Thanks.

15
00:03:47,428 --> 00:03:48,660
Happy birthday.

16
00:04:03,644 --> 00:04:05,611
Don't we look alike?

17
00:04:10,718 --> 00:04:11,917
My room.

18
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,559
Bathroom.

19
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,829
And drum roll...

20
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,566
Spare room.

21
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,793
Your brother
is not fond of strangers.

22
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,602
You didn't tell
me you were adopted.

23
00:05:05,572 --> 00:05:07,706
They found me in a basket
among the reeds.

24
00:05:10,844 --> 00:05:11,977
And Leo?

25
00:05:13,881 --> 00:05:14,946
Hm.

26
00:05:14,948 --> 00:05:16,048
In a handbag.

27
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:19,484
In Victoria Station.

28
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,652
Okay.

29
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,989
What else am I
gonna learn this week?

30
00:05:28,028 --> 00:05:29,027
I took a test.

31
00:05:34,601 --> 00:05:35,801
I'm pregnant.

32
00:05:44,745 --> 00:05:45,877
It's true.

33
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:50,449
Seriously.

34
00:05:51,719 --> 00:05:53,385
Are you serious?

35
00:05:56,657 --> 00:05:57,589
Don't do it.

36
00:05:59,626 --> 00:06:01,059
Why would you do that?

37
00:06:01,061 --> 00:06:02,427
Why would you do that?

38
00:06:02,429 --> 00:06:04,863
You f--

39
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:22,007
Does anyone ever
feel the same emotion

40
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:24,910
for a butterfly or a flower

41
00:07:25,946 --> 00:07:27,746
that they feel for a cathedral?

42
00:07:33,187 --> 00:07:34,519
Or a picture?

43
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:44,463
I know why you're here.

44
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:46,998
Bloodsuckers.

45
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:51,269
But I'm afraid
I am to disappoint.

46
00:07:57,544 --> 00:07:58,577
Lex?

47
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:01,780
Not this year, no tricks.

48
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:03,915
No hacks, no bugs.

49
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:10,555
What's up?

50
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:14,559
They're not his friends.

51
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:18,864
No, no, no.

52
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:22,534
This year we are the virus.

53
00:09:07,247 --> 00:09:08,313
Lex?

54
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:21,046
What do you do, Leo?

55
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,814
Live and breathe.

56
00:11:22,816 --> 00:11:25,784
I know, I know,
call me old-fashioned,

57
00:11:25,786 --> 00:11:26,898
but it's good work.

58
00:11:29,022 --> 00:11:30,955
If you can get it, of course.

59
00:11:34,127 --> 00:11:36,361
I answer questions.

60
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:38,863
I'm an artist.

61
00:11:38,865 --> 00:11:41,132
Don't they ask questions,
not answer them?

62
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:44,402
- Only the bad ones.
- What is it you say, Dru?

63
00:11:44,404 --> 00:11:47,739
Art allows us to find
ourselves and lose ourselves?

64
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:49,007
It's a quote.

65
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:52,210
I am lost.

66
00:11:54,114 --> 00:11:55,114
I am found.

67
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,276
Oh, I'm lost again.

68
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:28,947
Hey, smilo.

69
00:12:40,961 --> 00:12:43,795
He that is jealous
is not in love.

70
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:51,370
Jealous?

71
00:12:55,776 --> 00:12:57,909
Don't you mean,
"I love you, darling."

72
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:02,547
We grew up together, Dru.

73
00:13:04,184 --> 00:13:05,917
We didn't have anyone else.

74
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,396
It's been a pleasure.

75
00:14:25,398 --> 00:14:26,998
Leo, mate.

76
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:37,342
Come on, Lex.
Come on, please don't go.

77
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:58,663
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

78
00:14:58,665 --> 00:15:01,299
The pleasure, it was all mine.

79
00:15:02,702 --> 00:15:04,068
Wait!

80
00:15:17,984 --> 00:15:18,950
Easy.

81
00:15:18,952 --> 00:15:23,955
I'm not asking you
to leave, okay. You can stay.

82
00:15:23,957 --> 00:15:27,191
- But I've, I've had enough.
- We've been here one day!

83
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:30,628
You know I haven't seen him in years!
Please just, just stay a little bit longer!

84
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,631
Please.

85
00:15:57,057 --> 00:16:00,191
Daisy sucked too much
current and tripped the fuse.

86
00:16:00,193 --> 00:16:01,159
Daisy?

87
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:02,760
Yes.

88
00:16:05,165 --> 00:16:07,031
The system's fail-secure.

89
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,300
If the power cuts,
the door stays locked.

90
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:25,149
Good luck.

91
00:16:31,057 --> 00:16:32,156
Okay!

92
00:16:45,372 --> 00:16:46,671
What's the story?

93
00:16:49,042 --> 00:16:51,075
A system reset maybe.

94
00:16:52,345 --> 00:16:53,611
Still no signal.

95
00:17:01,154 --> 00:17:02,387
What are you doing?

96
00:17:02,389 --> 00:17:05,023
- Using Daisy's Internet.
- It's ergot.

97
00:17:05,025 --> 00:17:06,491
English!

98
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:07,692
Not connected.

99
00:17:10,096 --> 00:17:11,662
Security threat.

100
00:17:11,664 --> 00:17:12,630
So?

101
00:17:14,567 --> 00:17:15,533
What?

102
00:17:17,637 --> 00:17:20,304
- We wait.
- Wait for what?

103
00:17:20,306 --> 00:17:22,640
For me to regain
access to the security module.

104
00:17:23,843 --> 00:17:25,376
Or until someone drops by.

105
00:17:30,050 --> 00:17:30,848
Tea?

106
00:17:32,585 --> 00:17:34,052
We can bang on the walls.

107
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:35,420
The neighbors will hear us.

108
00:17:35,422 --> 00:17:38,623
We are the
only residents these days.

109
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,158
You've evicted everyone?

110
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:42,427
Leo?

111
00:17:42,429 --> 00:17:43,494
I gave them notice.

112
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:47,698
Excuse her French.

113
00:17:50,303 --> 00:17:52,870
You own the whole block?

114
00:17:52,872 --> 00:17:54,305
Yeah, us both.

115
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:55,673
We inherited it.

116
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,420
Keys.

117
00:18:49,229 --> 00:18:50,194
So what?

118
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,698
We wait.

119
00:19:00,907 --> 00:19:02,473
We'll ration our supplies.

120
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:05,176
She's got a point.

121
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,745
If we have to wait for
one of your friends to drop by,

122
00:19:07,747 --> 00:19:09,447
we could be here for a while.

123
00:19:14,654 --> 00:19:15,686
No offense.

124
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:39,610
Mm!

125
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:49,654
A priest, a rabbi,
and an imam walk into a bar.

126
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,924
The barman
looks at them and says,

127
00:19:52,926 --> 00:19:55,493
"What is this,
some kind of joke?"

128
00:19:55,495 --> 00:19:58,829
Wow.

129
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:03,234
Come on. Come on.

130
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:11,442
She talks about you.

131
00:20:11,444 --> 00:20:12,610
All the time.

132
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,762
Do you remember how we met?

133
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,397
You were alone.

134
00:20:39,038 --> 00:20:40,771
I asked if you were okay.

135
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:42,573
And what did I say?

136
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,875
Not a lot... at first.

137
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:49,113
You were dressed all in black
even though it was so hot.

138
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,586
I couldn't face it.

139
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:58,489
The funeral.

140
00:20:58,491 --> 00:21:00,992
You didn't like your dad.

141
00:21:00,994 --> 00:21:02,793
We never really knew him.

142
00:21:04,731 --> 00:21:06,430
He was always working,

143
00:21:06,432 --> 00:21:07,798
even after we were adopted.

144
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,402
After mom died,
he worked even harder.

145
00:21:24,717 --> 00:21:26,417
We had whatever we wanted.

146
00:21:28,321 --> 00:21:30,488
An endless holiday,
just the two of us.

147
00:21:32,292 --> 00:21:34,659
In that house
that was our universe.

148
00:21:41,968 --> 00:21:43,934
But everyone grows up.

149
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,690
Ow!

150
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,701
New category.

151
00:22:50,703 --> 00:22:54,605
Characters from fiction
with the same initials.

152
00:22:56,142 --> 00:22:57,174
Example.

153
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,945
Willy Wonka.

154
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:05,883
Rook to C4.

155
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,786
Mighty Mouse.

156
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:18,162
Uh... Bishop... to F7.

157
00:23:18,164 --> 00:23:19,397
And?

158
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:21,699
Bugs Bunny.

159
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,768
The Great Gatsby.

160
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:25,569
Knight to D7.

161
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,104
Check.

162
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:29,673
Wait. Checkmate.

163
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:31,609
It's Jay Gatsby,
not Great Gatsby,

164
00:23:31,611 --> 00:23:33,444
and it's my go.

165
00:23:33,446 --> 00:23:34,979
Peter Pan.

166
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:35,946
Peter Parker!

167
00:23:47,126 --> 00:23:50,161
Can you not cool her down
a wee bit, captain?

168
00:23:52,565 --> 00:23:56,033
It's an
inanimate object, firstly,

169
00:23:56,035 --> 00:23:58,002
and no, I can't.

170
00:23:58,871 --> 00:24:00,538
The fans are damaged.

171
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:03,641
You two had an argument?

172
00:24:07,447 --> 00:24:08,913
You don't have to answer.

173
00:24:16,522 --> 00:24:18,522
Daisy is not hardware.

174
00:24:18,524 --> 00:24:19,523
She's a virus.

175
00:24:22,094 --> 00:24:23,060
Look.

176
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,802
That's new.

177
00:24:39,178 --> 00:24:41,011
There are five laws to
create something from nothing.

178
00:24:41,013 --> 00:24:44,782
D-A-I-S-Y. Daisy.

179
00:24:44,784 --> 00:24:47,818
And these are the
laws your virus obeys?

180
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,487
These laws must be obeyed

181
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:51,889
by anything that
wishes to survive.

182
00:24:59,565 --> 00:25:01,565
D, distribute being.

183
00:25:02,835 --> 00:25:05,836
The whole is worth more
than the sum of its parts.

184
00:25:06,639 --> 00:25:09,273
A single honeybee
has a memory of six days,

185
00:25:09,275 --> 00:25:13,310
the hive a memory
of three months.

186
00:25:15,281 --> 00:25:16,580
And the second law?

187
00:25:16,582 --> 00:25:17,948
Accept your errors.

188
00:25:19,519 --> 00:25:21,886
Innovation is
indistinguishable from failure.

189
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:26,290
To be an error and to be cast
out is part of God's design.

190
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,126
I?

191
00:25:29,128 --> 00:25:30,561
Inherit the wind.

192
00:25:31,264 --> 00:25:33,330
Cause unrest and invite chaos.

193
00:25:38,204 --> 00:25:39,703
And the S?

194
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,906
Sacrifice form
for function.

195
00:25:41,908 --> 00:25:43,173
Fuck elegance.

196
00:25:43,175 --> 00:25:45,075
If it works, it's beautiful.

197
00:25:45,077 --> 00:25:48,178
- Y?
- Yield increasing returns.

198
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
Nurture successes.

199
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,992
Survival of the fittest.

200
00:26:05,298 --> 00:26:08,632
- What's the threat?
- She is.

201
00:26:08,634 --> 00:26:11,602
Her weakest traits she destroys.

202
00:26:12,371 --> 00:26:13,871
Artificial selection.

203
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,340
Judge, jury, and executioner.

204
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:17,708
And the defendant.

205
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:21,879
What's the point?

206
00:26:22,815 --> 00:26:24,181
Understanding.

207
00:26:26,385 --> 00:26:27,918
She's learning to learn.

208
00:26:58,684 --> 00:27:00,017
Wait.

209
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:08,292
Leo, Leo!

210
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:14,698
Get it out, get it out!
Get it out!

211
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,383
Leo!

212
00:27:33,686 --> 00:27:34,785
Leo!

213
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:41,859
Oh shit.

214
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:28,806
Shhhh...

215
00:28:44,790 --> 00:28:46,190
Well?

216
00:28:46,192 --> 00:28:48,292
- I don't know.
- Don't know what?

217
00:28:48,294 --> 00:28:50,794
What are you asking?

218
00:28:50,796 --> 00:28:52,096
I don't know.

219
00:29:19,992 --> 00:29:21,425
You don't know what they are?

220
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,829
They have
nothing to do with you?

221
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,068
How's your head?

222
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,180
What are we gonna do?

223
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:03,233
When I was a young child,

224
00:30:03,235 --> 00:30:06,370
I performed open-heart surgery
on the neighbor's cat.

225
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:11,875
While our father was away,

226
00:30:12,511 --> 00:30:17,281
I found all the papers, cash,
checkbooks, and credit cards,

227
00:30:18,317 --> 00:30:20,017
and burned them.

228
00:30:23,923 --> 00:30:28,025
This bottle of whiskey that
we've all been drinking from

229
00:30:28,961 --> 00:30:32,229
is spiked with a
very powerful and very rare

230
00:30:32,231 --> 00:30:34,198
slow-acting poison.

231
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:37,568
Which of these is true?

232
00:30:39,371 --> 00:30:40,337
None of it.

233
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,106
Very good.

234
00:30:43,108 --> 00:30:44,308
How did you know?

235
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:51,348
The cat was in fact a mouse.

236
00:30:51,350 --> 00:30:57,354
Lex burned daddy's papers, with my
help naturally, though it was her idea.

237
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,457
And no, I'm not
checking us all out early,

238
00:31:00,459 --> 00:31:02,259
although I did pick
this up on my travels,

239
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:05,996
and I did think today
was as good a day as any.

240
00:31:05,998 --> 00:31:06,997
To family.

241
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,299
To family.

242
00:31:17,977 --> 00:31:20,210
Do you believe in God?

243
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:33,523
You're asking
whether I believe, like Lex,

244
00:31:33,525 --> 00:31:36,393
that in another life
we'll see our mother again?

245
00:31:38,464 --> 00:31:41,164
- Do you?
- No.

246
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:42,900
- About which?
- None of it.

247
00:31:42,902 --> 00:31:44,034
How can you be certain?

248
00:31:45,638 --> 00:31:51,208
Let me ask you a question.
You're smart.

249
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:52,242
Thank you.

250
00:31:55,714 --> 00:31:59,049
You could do anything,

251
00:31:59,051 --> 00:32:00,384
yet here you are,

252
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:03,086
playing chess

253
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,556
against your own computer.

254
00:32:06,558 --> 00:32:09,259
And here you are,
a drunk sack of carbon

255
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,261
heckling another sack of carbon.

256
00:32:11,263 --> 00:32:13,430
Ignore him, Dru.
He's a bitter little boy

257
00:32:13,432 --> 00:32:14,998
with thoughts
too big for his head.

258
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,400
Ah.

259
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:18,735
What book did you
parrot that from, sis?

260
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:23,373
Do you actually have any friends or just
acquaintances you bribe with software?

261
00:32:27,313 --> 00:32:31,248
Because the company
you keep is so charming.

262
00:32:36,655 --> 00:32:38,956
<i>♪ When all is ending now ♪</i>

263
00:32:38,958 --> 00:32:42,659
<i>♪ I don't know if
I'll ever carry on ♪</i>

264
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,561
What if someone buzzes the door?

265
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:48,098
We mustn't fall asleep.

266
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,739
We mustn't.

267
00:32:58,477 --> 00:32:59,443
Please.

268
00:34:39,578 --> 00:34:41,378
They all have the same texture.

269
00:34:42,381 --> 00:34:43,346
Fractal.

270
00:34:44,583 --> 00:34:46,450
The same pattern
repeated over and over.

271
00:34:47,286 --> 00:34:49,453
The surface area to
volume ratio must be huge,

272
00:34:49,455 --> 00:34:51,888
giving them maximum
exposure to the environment.

273
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:54,458
But why?

274
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,595
- Where did they come from?
- Heightened sensory awareness

275
00:34:58,597 --> 00:35:00,230
for increased heat absorption.

276
00:35:00,232 --> 00:35:01,565
You look terrible.

277
00:35:08,674 --> 00:35:11,274
It's generating
its own electricity.

278
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:31,528
The organisms are
copied from nature.

279
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:33,663
I say copied.
She's borrowed liberally.

280
00:35:36,635 --> 00:35:39,236
She's reforming
the matter into tissue.

281
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:42,672
The maggots,
the insects, that plant.

282
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:45,942
They're part of her.

283
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:50,313
She's harvesting information.

284
00:35:53,352 --> 00:35:56,419
No, no, no, no, no!
What are you doing! Stop, stop, stop it!

285
00:35:56,421 --> 00:35:57,687
What are you doing!

286
00:35:59,158 --> 00:36:00,190
- Dru!
- Stop it!

287
00:36:01,226 --> 00:36:02,392
Leo!

288
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,771
Oh, that's my girl.

289
00:37:20,672 --> 00:37:22,272
Wait!

290
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:23,940
Lex! Get out the way!

291
00:37:29,281 --> 00:37:30,247
Think.

292
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:32,649
Think what it did to you.

293
00:37:32,651 --> 00:37:33,683
She's right.

294
00:37:40,459 --> 00:37:41,858
It's too dangerous.

295
00:38:24,369 --> 00:38:26,469
New recruits were always given
buzz cuts at the start of training,

296
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:28,571
initially to
prevent the spread of lice.

297
00:38:29,675 --> 00:38:31,374
Over time this
developed into uniform

298
00:38:31,376 --> 00:38:33,877
under the pretext of
easy maintenance and cooling.

299
00:38:35,681 --> 00:38:37,747
In reality it was another tool

300
00:38:37,749 --> 00:38:40,950
in the attempt to
depersonalize the individual.

301
00:38:40,952 --> 00:38:42,585
Comrades looking
into each other's eyes

302
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,020
would see
themselves reflected back,

303
00:38:44,022 --> 00:38:46,589
inspiring empathy
with their fellow soldiers.

304
00:38:55,133 --> 00:38:56,132
Unity.

305
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:58,368
Allegiance.

306
00:38:58,370 --> 00:39:00,437
Worker bees and soldier ants.

307
00:39:00,439 --> 00:39:02,706
Long live the queen!

308
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:07,077
Look for signal.

309
00:39:07,079 --> 00:39:08,044
We did.

310
00:39:08,046 --> 00:39:09,546
Look again.

311
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:20,957
Hey. Whatcha doing?

312
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:25,428
What are you doing?

313
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,531
Uh, you're
looking for an escape?

314
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,802
What's your suggestion?

315
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:36,106
My suggestion?

316
00:39:36,108 --> 00:39:38,041
I don't know.

317
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,476
I'm just starting to have fun.

318
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:43,079
My headache's gone.

319
00:39:43,081 --> 00:39:45,782
I feel cleansed.

320
00:39:46,852 --> 00:39:48,051
Oi, Santa!

321
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,125
Hey!

322
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,068
Seriously?

323
00:40:09,674 --> 00:40:11,174
What do you say?

324
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:14,778
Brother-in-law bonding sesh?

325
00:40:16,415 --> 00:40:18,014
I'll go easy, I promise.

326
00:40:20,118 --> 00:40:21,718
You like games?

327
00:40:36,902 --> 00:40:37,867
Cheers.

328
00:40:43,442 --> 00:40:44,641
How long have you lived here?

329
00:40:49,981 --> 00:40:52,949
- How long?
- Years.

330
00:40:52,951 --> 00:40:55,552
- So, long enough to--
- Your move.

331
00:40:58,824 --> 00:41:01,057
- To know any--
- Any secret passages,

332
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:02,792
wormholes.

333
00:41:02,794 --> 00:41:03,827
Yeah, presumably.

334
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,095
No phone connection.

335
00:41:07,165 --> 00:41:09,966
No Internet. No neighbors.

336
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,837
Electronic locking system.

337
00:41:13,839 --> 00:41:15,605
Shuttered windows.

338
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:18,675
Checkmate.

339
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,278
The shutters,
where are the keys?

340
00:41:26,251 --> 00:41:27,217
Again.

341
00:41:30,088 --> 00:41:31,054
The keys?

342
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:33,490
Left.

343
00:41:33,492 --> 00:41:34,924
The white's in your left hand.

344
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,296
Micro expressions.

345
00:41:40,298 --> 00:41:42,765
Well, macro in your case.

346
00:41:42,767 --> 00:41:45,301
The way you held out
your hands, your eyes.

347
00:41:47,072 --> 00:41:49,572
How can you know this?

348
00:41:49,574 --> 00:41:51,307
Because Daisy knows this.

349
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:04,587
Come on, come on, come on.

350
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:21,571
Hello? I'm locked in
an apartment on um--

351
00:42:21,573 --> 00:42:24,207
<i>Emergency services
have been temporarily suspended</i>

352
00:42:24,209 --> 00:42:26,976
<i>in the Greater London Area.</i>

353
00:42:26,978 --> 00:42:29,012
<i>In case of a structural fire,</i>

354
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:32,015
<i>evacuate the premises
immediately please. Thank you.</i>

355
00:43:53,331 --> 00:43:54,397
<i>You've been recording us.</i>

356
00:43:55,767 --> 00:43:57,133
You've been recording us.

357
00:43:58,236 --> 00:43:59,702
This whole time.

358
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:01,938
Recording?

359
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:02,905
No.

360
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:07,977
I fed Daisy the video
as initial stimulus!

361
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:11,147
It's been watching us.

362
00:44:13,051 --> 00:44:14,350
- Lex!
- What?

363
00:44:14,352 --> 00:44:15,385
It's too dangerous.

364
00:44:16,688 --> 00:44:19,022
It's not him,
all right, it's the computer.

365
00:44:19,024 --> 00:44:20,723
So you're on his side now?

366
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:24,394
Listen to me, I think it's
gone to his head. Lex!

367
00:44:34,706 --> 00:44:35,805
Turn the light off.

368
00:44:51,322 --> 00:44:52,355
Stay there.

369
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,261
Right, so you can see me here
and me on the monitors.

370
00:44:58,263 --> 00:44:59,729
Yeah.

371
00:45:19,851 --> 00:45:21,818
What, what is this?

372
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:23,219
Their predictions.

373
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:25,888
So what, it can tell the future?

374
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:28,491
She's making
very educated guesses

375
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:30,993
based on her
observation of our behavior.

376
00:45:44,509 --> 00:45:48,111
When I look at myself,
the image disappears.

377
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:50,213
Feedback.

378
00:45:50,215 --> 00:45:54,884
Seeing yourself in the future
influences you in the present.

379
00:45:56,121 --> 00:45:58,888
Choice. Try it.

380
00:45:58,890 --> 00:46:00,490
What do I have to do?

381
00:46:01,326 --> 00:46:03,025
Whatever you want.

382
00:47:31,482 --> 00:47:33,649
I know you're in there.

383
00:47:37,956 --> 00:47:39,856
Just gonna wait here.

384
00:47:53,071 --> 00:47:54,036
Lex?

385
00:47:58,576 --> 00:47:59,609
I love you.

386
00:48:01,212 --> 00:48:05,248
I uh... don't say that

387
00:48:06,985 --> 00:48:08,017
very often.

388
00:48:20,698 --> 00:48:23,599

Sis.

433
00:52:55,439 --> 00:52:57,806
"As truth and beauty
shall together thrive,

434

If from thyself to store
thou wouldst convert.

Or else of thee
this I prognosticate.

Thy end is truth's

Shakespeare.

438
00:53:32,977 --> 00:53:34,577
Daisy's a big fan.

439
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,686
I fed her his completed
works for language analysis,

440
00:53:43,688 --> 00:53:47,323
along with 20,000 gigabytes
of other digitized literature.

441
00:53:47,325 --> 00:53:49,458
Notably she categorized Romeo
and Juliet with the comedies

442
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:51,293
and recognized
homoerotic and Catholic trends

443
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:52,528
in much of his writing.

444
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:56,999
Of course academics have
pointed out these connections,

445
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,901
but I thought it was--

446
00:53:58,903 --> 00:54:00,636
Not my good side.

447
00:54:00,638 --> 00:54:03,672
- Shut up!
- Have you prayed for me, sis?

448
00:54:03,674 --> 00:54:05,708
That I'll be swept to salvation?

449
00:54:48,386 --> 00:54:49,485
Hey, hey, aw!

450
00:54:50,921 --> 00:54:51,954
No, no, no, no, no!

451
00:54:56,027 --> 00:54:57,293
You're welcome.

452
00:55:26,090 --> 00:55:27,389
The airflow must be oxidized

453
00:55:27,391 --> 00:55:29,725
by whatever's in that pipe.

454
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,966
Plastics tend to
be resistant to acid.

455
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:43,405
What?

456
00:55:47,511 --> 00:55:50,946
Okay, okay, okay! Easy! Easy!

457
00:55:56,921 --> 00:55:59,154
Oh, come on, come on.

458
00:56:00,524 --> 00:56:01,824
Coming, coming!

459
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:48,137
Tinkerbell?

460
00:56:53,477 --> 00:56:54,676
Lex?

461
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:11,660
Run.

462
00:57:16,801 --> 00:57:19,468
Leo!

463
00:57:33,984 --> 00:57:37,586
Get out of the way, get out of
the way! Get out of the way, move!

464
00:57:50,234 --> 00:57:52,167
Three, two, one!

465
00:58:10,521 --> 00:58:11,787
Hey.

466
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,822
What is this?

467
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:14,857
A trial version.

468
00:58:16,861 --> 00:58:18,093
You missed my speech.

469
00:58:19,296 --> 00:58:21,530
I gave them out at the party.

470
00:58:31,976 --> 00:58:33,308
How many?

471
00:58:47,258 --> 00:58:49,224
Say something.

472
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,260
It was an experiment.

473
01:00:18,616 --> 01:00:20,048
They're Bible verses.

474
01:00:27,391 --> 01:00:30,025
They were seared by the intense
heat and they cursed the name of God

475
01:00:30,027 --> 01:00:32,160
who had control
over these plagues

476
01:00:32,162 --> 01:00:34,663
but they refused to
repent and glorify Him.

477
01:00:37,434 --> 01:00:39,868
Be sure that my words
are not false.

478
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:42,037
One who has perfect
knowledge is with you.

479
01:00:44,141 --> 01:00:46,675
He who is coming will come
and will not delay.

480
01:01:10,434 --> 01:01:11,466
Lex!

481
01:01:22,479 --> 01:01:24,246
What was that?

482
01:01:24,248 --> 01:01:25,914
Earthquake?

483
01:01:25,916 --> 01:01:27,849
We don't get earthquakes.

484
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:31,953
This place, hitting more than 900 miles away
from the nearest tectonic boundary in Britain,

485
01:01:31,955 --> 01:01:34,222
- is still susceptible to--
- Not now!

486
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,066
What are you doing?

487
01:01:46,704 --> 01:01:47,736
An experiment.

488
01:02:09,827 --> 01:02:10,859
Change it.

an alleged co-conspirator</i>

503
01:03:09,820 --> 01:03:11,353
<i>in the high-profile
security attack</i>

504
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:12,788
<i>that has crippled the country.</i>

505
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:22,197
<i> The young boy,</i>
<i>identified as Robert Abel,</i>

506
01:03:22,199 --> 01:03:24,533
<i>was pronounced dead
at the scene.</i>

507
01:03:24,535 --> 01:03:27,369
<i>He's believed to be the victim
of a corrosive chemical agent.</i>

508
01:03:28,405 --> 01:03:30,806
<i>A third of five suspects
were also found dead,</i>

509
01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:32,808
<i>while two remain at large.</i>

510
01:03:32,810 --> 01:03:34,342
<i>The first is
known only to police</i>

511
01:03:34,344 --> 01:03:37,112
<i>by their online
alter ego, Tinkerbell.</i>

512
01:03:37,114 --> 01:03:40,949
<i>Very little is known
about the alleged ringleader.</i>

513
01:03:43,921 --> 01:03:45,921
<i> The terrorist</i>
<i>hacker group Sentient</i>

514
01:03:45,923 --> 01:03:47,489
<i>is believed to have
breached the firewalls</i>

515
01:03:47,491 --> 01:03:50,025
<i>of a number of
British organizations,</i>

516
01:03:50,027 --> 01:03:52,527
<i>including the National Health
Service and the Ministry of Defense.</i>

517
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:55,831
<i>Flights to and from
the UK have been suspended</i>

518
01:03:55,833 --> 01:03:57,599
<i>as a precautionary measure.</i>

519
01:03:57,601 --> 01:04:00,602
<i>The virus has spread
to over 200,000 computers</i>

520
01:04:00,604 --> 01:04:02,971
<i>in more than 150 countries.</i>

521
01:04:02,973 --> 01:04:06,107
<i>The motive is as yet unknown.</i>

522
01:04:06,109 --> 01:04:07,075
All-knowing.

523
01:04:09,646 --> 01:04:14,082
- All-powerful.
- Leo?

524
01:04:14,084 --> 01:04:16,985
<i>A deadly pathogen
believed to be carried by insects</i>

525
01:04:16,987 --> 01:04:19,354
<i>has killed 44 people
and left hundreds</i>

526
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:21,056
<i>- in critical condition.</i>
- You did this.

527
01:04:21,058 --> 01:04:25,293
<i>- Swarms have been...</i>
- Cheer up, Dru.

528
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:28,029
At least we're the
last to leave the party.

529
01:04:28,031 --> 01:04:31,466
<i>Earlier today the Health Service...</i>

530
01:04:32,903 --> 01:04:35,604
<i> We don't know too much
about the plague at the present time,</i>

531
01:04:35,606 --> 01:04:39,407
<i>but we are advising
that you develop sensible--</i>

532
01:04:39,409 --> 01:04:41,276
Is this what you wanted?

533
01:04:44,348 --> 01:04:46,348
<i> As soon as we</i>
<i>have any further information,</i>

534
01:04:46,350 --> 01:04:47,949
<i>we'll do a press release.</i>

535
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,188
<i>I don't have any further
comments at the time, thank you.</i>

536
01:05:24,221 --> 01:05:26,187
Tell me about yourself.

537
01:05:32,195 --> 01:05:33,361
Do I come here much?

538
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:36,498
All the time.

539
01:05:37,935 --> 01:05:39,367
It's like I never leave.

540
01:05:44,041 --> 01:05:45,440
Hey, Daisy.

541
01:05:46,243 --> 01:05:47,509
What are you thinking?

542
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:50,512
Daisy?

543
01:05:54,284 --> 01:05:55,517
Say something.

544
01:06:32,055 --> 01:06:33,355
She chose me.

545
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:36,324
What?

546
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:42,130
He would appear a second time,

547
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:44,432
not to bear sin,
but to bring salvation

548
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:45,533
to those who await Him.

549
01:06:49,740 --> 01:06:50,705
I'm pregnant.

550
01:06:55,112 --> 01:06:56,611
What, what are you saying?

551
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:11,826
- I don't understand.
- Come.

552
01:07:13,063 --> 01:07:14,496
Pray with me, Dru.

553
01:07:14,498 --> 01:07:16,331
We don't have long.

554
01:07:27,277 --> 01:07:31,613
Hail Mary, full of grace,
our Lord is with thee.

555
01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:33,615
- Blessed art thou among women.
- Lex.

556
01:07:33,617 --> 01:07:35,650
Blessed is
the fruit of thy womb.

557
01:07:35,652 --> 01:07:37,285
- Lex.
- Jesus.

558
01:07:37,287 --> 01:07:42,190
Holy Mary, Mother of God.
Pray for us sinners

559
01:07:42,192 --> 01:07:44,759
- now in the hour of our death.
- This isn't you.

560
01:07:44,761 --> 01:07:47,495
- Amen.
- This isn't you.

561
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:50,131
- It's not.
- It's okay.

562
01:07:50,133 --> 01:07:51,166
It's okay.

563
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:52,133
Lex.

564
01:07:55,472 --> 01:07:58,139
Lex, Lex. Hey, hey.

565
01:07:58,842 --> 01:08:00,508
What's going on? Lex.

566
01:08:09,753 --> 01:08:11,486
This'll never do.

567
01:08:19,596 --> 01:08:21,329
Look at you.

568
01:08:24,901 --> 01:08:26,534
You're a monster.

569
01:08:30,540 --> 01:08:33,308
No wonder she's not interested.

570
01:08:35,479 --> 01:08:38,213
I said no wonder
you're not interested!

571
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:54,896
- Get Leo!
- What?

572
01:08:54,898 --> 01:08:58,500
- Get Leo! Get Leo!
- Okay.

573
01:09:20,924 --> 01:09:22,223
I'm sorry.

574
01:09:22,225 --> 01:09:23,191
I'm sorry.

575
01:09:28,598 --> 01:09:29,564
Leo!
