1
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:45,252
Brecken……我不希望你吃里面的任何东西，明白吗?
Brecken... I don't want you eating anything you find in there, you understand me?

2
00:02:45,295 --> 00:02:46,992
我不管它是什么。
I don't care what it is.

3
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:55,653
不管它是什么。
Don't care what it is.

4
00:04:51,116 --> 00:04:56,513
啊…妈妈!妈妈!
Ah... Mum! Mum!

5
00:04:56,557 --> 00:04:58,689
——不!不!
- No! No!

6
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,432
不!不,不!
No! No, no!

7
00:05:42,559 --> 00:05:44,126
是吗?
Yes?

8
00:05:44,431 --> 00:05:45,954
是的，还是Djuna。
Yes, it's still Djuna.

9
00:05:45,997 --> 00:05:47,651
现在你已经确认了电话号码。
Now you've confirmed the phone number.

10
00:05:48,652 --> 00:05:57,618
我要你告诉朗如果他有兴趣去捡那个被他称为儿子的生物的尸体是的，我是说布雷肯。
I want you to tell Lang that if he's interested in picking up the corpse of that creature he calls his son-- Yes, yes, I mean the Brecken thing.

11
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:01,709
所以，你告诉他到我给你的地址来。
So, you tell him to come to the address I gave you.

12
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:04,276
它会在这里，而我却不在。
It will be here, and I won't be.

13
00:07:42,549 --> 00:07:44,464
我的孩子，孩子，孩子。
Oh, my boy, boy, boy.

14
00:07:44,812 --> 00:07:46,378
我的孩子。哦,我的孩子。
My boy. Oh, my boy.

15
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:39,562
扫罗。
Saul.

16
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:42,565
索尔，亲爱的，你能醒醒吗?
Saul, darling, can you wake up?

17
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,307
这里是谁?
Who's here?

18
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,222
这只是我。
It's just me.

19
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,789
这是任性。
It's Caprice.

20
00:08:49,746 --> 00:08:51,313
你睡了吗?
Did you sleep?

21
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:58,102
我觉得这……床需要新的软件。
I think this... bed needs new software.

22
00:09:03,064 --> 00:09:06,197
它不会再预见我的痛苦了。
It's not anticipating my pain anymore.

23
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,814
它不能让我正常转动。
It's not turning me properly.

24
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,773
-是的，我听到了
- Yes, I heard you.

25
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,558
-一个不眠之夜。
- A sleepless night.

26
00:09:18,993 --> 00:09:21,082
我马上给LifeFormWare打电话。
I will call LifeFormWare right away.

27
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,649
他们通常很有反应。
They're usually very responsive.

28
00:09:25,434 --> 00:09:27,305
——还有什么?还有什么?
- What else? What else?

29
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:31,483
-测试做了一整晚，今天早上就做好了。
- The tests cooked all night and were ready this morning.

30
00:09:33,355 --> 00:09:35,575
你的血液中有一种新的激素。
There is a new hormone in your bloodstream.

31
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:41,624
啊…太好了。
Ah... Great.

32
00:09:41,972 --> 00:09:43,539
它是关于时间。
It's about time.

33
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,238
我以为我已经筋疲力尽了。
I thought I was all tapped out.

34
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:50,372
枯竭。
Dried up.

35
00:09:50,415 --> 00:09:52,853
-你总是这么想，你总是错的。
- You always think that, and you're always wrong.

36
00:09:54,942 --> 00:09:56,596
-总有一天我会说对的
- One day, I'll be right.

37
00:09:57,031 --> 00:09:58,598
不是今天。
Not today.

38
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:05,605
不是今天。
Not today.

39
00:10:08,782 --> 00:10:10,348
现在还没吃早饭呢。
It's still before breakfast.

40
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:16,746
你看到了什么?
What do you see?

41
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:19,662
我能感觉到你在里面拖东西。
I can feel you pulling things around in there.

42
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:27,148
-好像是一种小的内分泌腺，肾上腺大小。
- It seems to be some small sort of, uh, endocrine gland, about the size of an adrenal gland.

43
00:10:27,975 --> 00:10:29,541
小。
Small.

44
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,588
这是令人失望的。这不是很戏剧化。
That's disappointing. It's not very dramatic.

45
00:10:34,198 --> 00:10:37,680
-这是一个从未见过的全新器官。
- It's a brand new organ Never before seen.

46
00:10:37,724 --> 00:10:39,116
是的。
Yeah.

47
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,683
-它在工作。
- And it's functioning.

48
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,643
你能感觉到吗?
Can you feel it?

49
00:10:44,513 --> 00:10:46,036
新激素?
That new hormone?

50
00:10:46,515 --> 00:10:48,038
是的。
Yeah.

51
00:10:48,865 --> 00:10:51,172
哦,LifeFormWare。
Oh, LifeFormWare.

52
00:10:53,261 --> 00:10:54,784
LifeFormWare吗?
LifeFormWare?

53
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:57,221
是的。
Yeah.

54
00:10:57,265 --> 00:10:59,006
痛苦是不同的。
The pain is different.

55
00:10:59,049 --> 00:11:01,486
这可能就是我床上的电脑出问题的原因。
That's probably why my bed's computer's having trouble.

56
00:11:03,097 --> 00:11:07,318
这个新器官，它在转移我的疼痛中枢。
This new organ, it's, uh, it's shifting my pain centres.

57
00:11:08,319 --> 00:11:09,843
-是好是坏?
- For better or worse?

58
00:11:10,757 --> 00:11:12,323
-到目前为止，只是不同而已。
- So far, just different.

59
00:11:17,198 --> 00:11:18,721
美术进展如何?
How's the artwork progressing?

60
00:11:20,854 --> 00:11:22,420
这是一个很滑的表面。
It's a slippery surface.

61
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,902
用墨水很难精确。
Hard to be precise with the ink.

62
00:11:27,382 --> 00:11:31,691
嗯……为什么不做一些看起来像纹身的东西呢?
Huh... Why not do something that really looks like a tattoo?

63
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:38,262
一颗心，一个锚，“妈妈”?
A heart, an anchor, "Mother"?

64
00:11:42,353 --> 00:11:43,877
-那会很好玩的。
- That would be playful.

65
00:11:44,138 --> 00:11:47,707
但书记官处坚持“独特的自我参照”。
But the Registry insists on "uniquely self-referential."

66
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:49,621
啊,注册表。
Ah, the Registry.

67
00:11:51,885 --> 00:11:53,408
当然可以。
Of course.

68
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:29,912
扫罗紧张。
Saul Tenser.

69
00:14:29,956 --> 00:14:31,479
反复无常。
Caprice.

70
00:14:31,522 --> 00:14:32,959
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

71
00:14:33,002 --> 00:14:34,569
所以你。
So you are.

72
00:14:35,091 --> 00:14:36,658
受欢迎的。
Welcome.

73
00:14:36,701 --> 00:14:38,225
对了，我叫威佩特。
I'm Wippet, by the way.

74
00:14:39,922 --> 00:14:46,886
哇,嗯…-这是我们的荣幸，不是吗，蒂姆林?
Wow, um... - This is a real treat and a privilege for us, isn't it, Timlin?

75
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,452
这是Timlin。
That's Timlin.

76
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:58,419
这不是很壮观，对吧，但这是国家器官登记中心，我们的设备很齐全，不是吗，蒂姆林?
This isn't very grand, is it, but this is the National Organ Registry nonetheless, and we're fully equipped, aren't we, Timlin?

77
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:09,082
现在这些都是秘密，因为我们是正义NVU的一员，但我们会做好准备，在不可避免的时候公开。
Um, it's all secret stuff now because we're part of the NVU of Justice, but we'll be ready to break out and go public when the time inevitably comes.

78
00:15:09,604 --> 00:15:11,127
NVU吗?
NVU?

79
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:13,173
新的副单位。
New Vice Unit.

80
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:15,436
没有什么犯罪比得上现在。
No crime like the present.

81
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:20,310
-抱歉，我们对程序有点困惑。
- Sorry, we're a little confused about procedure.

82
00:15:21,094 --> 00:15:22,878
这是我们第一次。
This is our first time.

83
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:25,359
嗯。
Hm.

84
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:30,407
但是你从安全的角度了解器官登记的必要性吗?
But you understand the necessity of organ registration from a security standpoint?

85
00:15:30,886 --> 00:15:34,455
我们知道人体正在发生变化。
We understand human bodies are changing.

86
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:40,287
我很清楚这一点。
I know this quite well.

87
00:15:41,853 --> 00:15:47,816
嗯…显然，这是世界各国政府所关心的问题。
Um... And, apparently, this is of some concern to the governments of the world.

88
00:15:47,859 --> 00:15:49,383
人类的身体,是的。
Human bodies, yes.

89
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:51,907
“人”是关键字。
"Human" is the operative word.

90
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:55,041
人类进化是问题所在。
Human evolution is the concern.

91
00:15:55,084 --> 00:15:56,520
它出了问题。
That it's going wrong.

92
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:02,526
它是……不受控制的,这是……起义的。
That it's... uncontrolled, it's... insurrectional.

93
00:16:02,570 --> 00:16:06,095
它可能会把我们引向不好的地方。
It might lead us to a bad place.

94
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,620
比如，看看疼痛阈值发生了什么变化。
Look what's happened to the pain thresholds, for instance.

95
00:16:09,664 --> 00:16:16,105
现在世界变得更加危险，因为疼痛几乎消失了。
The world is a much more dangerous place now that p-p-pain has all but disappeared.

96
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:20,501
只有少数幸运儿在睡眠中经历疼痛有什么好处呢?
What good is it that only a lucky handful of us experience pain in our sleep?

97
00:16:20,544 --> 00:16:22,329
疼痛是有作用的。
Pain has a function.

98
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:28,900
这是一个我们已经没有的预警系统，这是怎么发生的，这意味着什么?
It is a warning system that we don't have anymore, and how did this happen, what does this mean?

99
00:16:28,944 --> 00:16:31,077
或者感染呢?
Or, or what about infections?

100
00:16:31,599 --> 00:16:33,818
感染?他们怎么了?
Infections? What happened to them?

101
00:16:33,862 --> 00:16:35,820
现在没人洗手了。
Nobody washes their hands anymore.

102
00:16:35,864 --> 00:16:40,738
那是什么，那个新的时尚，叫什么来着?桌面手术?
What is it- what is that new, uh, fad, uh, what do they call it? Desktop surgery?

103
00:16:40,782 --> 00:16:42,305
在公共场合!
In public!

104
00:16:42,349 --> 00:16:43,915
这是令人厌恶的。
It's repulsive.

105
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:56,450
——嗯…我们的记录显示多年来你一直在随机制造新奇的身体器官，但你一直在移除它们。
- Um... Our records indicate that you've been producing random and novel bodily organs for some years, but that you've had them consistently removed.

106
00:16:58,887 --> 00:17:00,541
谁不想呢?
Who wouldn't?

107
00:17:02,673 --> 00:17:04,023
-你会很惊讶的。
- You'd be surprised.

108
00:17:04,066 --> 00:17:05,589
-我们会很惊讶。
- We would be surprised.

109
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,156
它们基本上是肿瘤，对吧?
They're basically tumours, right?

110
00:17:07,504 --> 00:17:09,289
谁会想要它们呢?
Who would want to keep them?

111
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:11,030
他们会杀了你的。
They could kill you.

112
00:17:12,509 --> 00:17:14,424
你们俩是什么关系?
- What is the relationship between you two?

113
00:17:15,947 --> 00:17:18,689
-我切除这些肿瘤是我们表演的一部分。
- I remove these tumours as part of our performance.

114
00:17:19,603 --> 00:17:21,127
我们是行为艺术家。
We are performance artists.

115
00:17:21,823 --> 00:17:23,390
我们一起执行。
We perform together.

116
00:17:23,825 --> 00:17:25,348
嗯。
Hm.

117
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,829
你有资格做手术吗?
And you're qualified to perform surgery?

118
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:33,008
-就像威佩特先生说的，现在每个人都有资格做手术。
- Well, as Mr. Wippet was saying, everybody's qualified to perform surgery these days.

119
00:17:34,749 --> 00:17:39,406
如果同意是合法的，那就真的没有问题了。
- If consent is legally given, there is really no- no issue there.

120
00:17:39,928 --> 00:17:41,451
嗯。
Hm.

121
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,627
我说的是你们的工作关系。
I was speaking of your professional relationship.

122
00:17:43,671 --> 00:17:47,196
你不会想杀了你的表演搭档吧?
You wouldn't want to kill your performance partner, would you?

123
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:48,719
你永远不会知道的。
You never know.

124
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:51,200
我们的演出中有很多即兴表演。
There's a lot of improvisation in our shows.

125
00:17:51,244 --> 00:17:52,810
阻止它。
Stop it.

126
00:17:52,854 --> 00:17:54,508
嗯。
Hm.

127
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:57,293
我们是在索尔执行任务时认识的。
- We met when Saul was cut up on duty.

128
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,601
我曾是第一总医院的创伤外科医生。
I was a trauma surgeon at First General.

129
00:18:01,558 --> 00:18:03,560
我们释放了彼此的潜能。
We unleashed things in each other.

130
00:18:04,779 --> 00:18:08,087
我们都改变了，离开了我们的职业。
We both changed, left our professions.

131
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,915
现在我们就是这样了。
And now we are what we are.

132
00:18:11,264 --> 00:18:12,830
哦。
Oh.

133
00:18:12,874 --> 00:18:14,615
你们是明星，这就是你们。
You're stars, that's what you are.

134
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:18,097
天啊，现在每个人都想成为行为艺术家。
Gosh, everyone wants to be a performance artist these days.

135
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:21,926
-现在很流行，但是…不是每个人都能做的。
- It's all the rage, but... not everyone can do it.

136
00:18:24,015 --> 00:18:25,713
好吧,然后……
Well, then...

137
00:18:27,802 --> 00:18:29,325
注册?
Registration?

138
00:18:43,774 --> 00:18:45,428
哦,我的。
Oh, my.

139
00:18:45,472 --> 00:18:49,302
哦，它是如此美丽!
Oh, it is so beautiful!

140
00:18:50,825 --> 00:18:53,001
-我的角度看不太清楚。
- I can't quite see it from my angle.

141
00:18:53,044 --> 00:18:54,481
你能从你所在的地方把它捡起来吗?
Can you pick it up from where you are?

142
00:18:54,524 --> 00:18:57,005
-哦,是的。这很清楚没办法。
- Oh, yes. It's-it's very clear.

143
00:18:57,048 --> 00:18:59,181
哦,天哪!
Oh, gosh!

144
00:18:59,225 --> 00:19:06,057
这是一个华丽的，我甚至可以说，纹身者艺术的感性的例子。
It is a gorgeous, I might even say, sensual example of the registration tatooist's art.

145
00:19:06,101 --> 00:19:08,799
-你为什么不告诉我们注册纹身是什么?
- Why don't you tell us what a registration tattoo is?

146
00:19:08,843 --> 00:19:29,255
嗯,嗯……我们国家器官登记处刚刚制定了一项新政策，即在新器官或特发性器官上纹身，即在功能未知的新器官上纹身，以便对它们进行登记和跟踪。
Well, um... ... we here at the National Organ Registry have just instituted a new policy of tattooing novel organs, or idiopathic organs, that is, new organs whose function is unknown,so that they can be registered and kept track of.

147
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:47,273
嗯，我们的恐惧是……这些新器官中的一些可能会在基因上建立起来，然后从父母传给孩子，严格地说，孩子就不再是人类了。
Um, our fear is... that some of these neo-organs might establish themselves genetically, and then be passed down from parents to children, who would then no longer be, strictly speaking, human.

148
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:49,579
至少在传统意义上是这样。
At least, in the classical sense.

149
00:19:51,059 --> 00:20:00,024
我们对注册纹身的概念很大程度上受到了Saul Tenser的行为艺术的启发。
Our concept of the registration tattoo was largely inspired by the performance art of Saul Tenser.

150
00:20:00,068 --> 00:20:03,114
-哦，我很抱歉，但这里禁止录音。
- Oh, I'm so sorry, but it's forbidden to record in here.

151
00:20:03,158 --> 00:20:05,726
-哦，对，对。她是对的。
- Oh, right, right. She's right.

152
00:20:05,769 --> 00:20:08,816
-我在想我们可以用它来表演。
- I was thinking we could use it for our performance.

153
00:20:09,382 --> 00:20:11,079
我们记录最私密的事情。
We record the most intimate things.

154
00:20:11,122 --> 00:20:13,037
-对不起，这是违法的。
- I'm sorry, but it is illegal.

155
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:14,735
这个部门还不存在。
This department does not yet exist.

156
00:20:17,564 --> 00:20:22,264
-对，如果它不存在，我想，那就不可能录音。
- Right, if it doesn't exist, then, I guess, it's impossible to make a recording.

157
00:20:22,308 --> 00:20:23,874
——对不起。
- Sorry.

158
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:25,833
太糟糕了。
Too bad.

159
00:20:36,322 --> 00:20:40,151
我觉得你不该邀请登记处的那两个变态来参加我们的节目。
I don't think you should have invited those two creeps from the registry to our show.

160
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:43,546
——为什么不呢?
- Why not?

161
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:45,505
为什么不让他们站在我们这边?
Why not get 'em on our side?

162
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:47,420
我不相信他们。
I don't trust them.

163
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:53,034
那个女人，蒂姆林，她…尤其令人毛骨悚然。
The woman, Timlin, she's, uh... especially creepy.

164
00:20:53,077 --> 00:20:54,601
嗯。
Hm.

165
00:20:54,644 --> 00:20:56,777
我认为她相当迷人。
I thought she was rather attractive.

166
00:20:56,820 --> 00:20:59,954
以官僚主义的方式。
In a... bureaucratic way.

167
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:01,521
嗯。
Hm.

168
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,091
LifeFormWare的技术人员在这里。
The LifeFormWare technicians are here.

169
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:10,138
他们需要看到你躺在床上。
They need to see you in your bed.

170
00:21:12,619 --> 00:21:14,577
-我对纹身有点不高兴。
- I'm a little upset about the tattoo.

171
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:17,841
哦?
Oh?

172
00:21:19,669 --> 00:21:21,236
喧闹的。
Rambunctious.

173
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,325
我就是这么叫的。
That's what I'd call it.

174
00:21:23,369 --> 00:21:25,240
-这是专业术语吗?
- That's a technical term?

175
00:21:25,588 --> 00:21:27,155
紧张。;呃。
TENSER.; Uh.

176
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:35,555
-它接管了器官本身的形状。
- It takes over the form, the shape of the organ itself.

177
00:21:35,598 --> 00:21:39,863
从某种意义上说，它真的主导了它，重塑了它。
It really, in a sense, dominates it, reshapes it.

178
00:21:39,907 --> 00:21:44,390
它不仅仅是寄生的，尽管我认为，在某种意义上，它也是。
It's not just parasitic, although I suppose, in a sense, it is that too.

179
00:21:44,433 --> 00:21:49,046
它似乎剥夺了器官的意义。
It seems to take meaning away from the organ.

180
00:21:49,699 --> 00:21:56,315
可以这么说，他把意义的过程当作自己的过程。
Takes the process of meaning for itself, so to speak.

181
00:22:06,237 --> 00:22:07,891
-你最好上床睡觉。
- You'd really better get into bed.

182
00:22:09,371 --> 00:22:10,894
在那里,在那里。
There, there.

183
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:13,810
你很快就会舒服的。
You'll be comfortable again soon.

184
00:22:15,682 --> 00:22:18,728
OrchidBed是我们线床的顶部。
OrchidBed is our top of the line bed.

185
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:30,305
一旦我们纠正了由你的…荷尔蒙失调，你会浮起来。
Once we correct the misalignment caused by your... hormonal imbalance, you'll be floating.

186
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:31,872
——嗯。
- Huh.

187
00:22:31,915 --> 00:22:33,439
-对吧，Berst?
- Isn't that right, Berst?

188
00:22:34,570 --> 00:22:36,137
——嗯。
- Uh-uh.

189
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,487
是的，这些东西基本上是防弹的。
Yeah, these things are basically bulletproof.

190
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:40,924
这张床喜欢你的身材，张瑟先生。
This bed loves your body, Mr. Tenser.

191
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:46,539
它是如此灵活，如此适应你疼痛中枢的每一个变化，这是一件美丽的事情。
It is so flexible, so attuned to every shift of your pain centres, it's a beautiful thing to behold.

192
00:22:48,105 --> 00:22:53,502
我看到你这里有我们几个小队的人-是吗?-嗯嗯。
I see you actually have several of our units here, - don't you? - Mm-hm.

193
00:22:53,546 --> 00:22:58,986
-兰花床，早餐椅，这些可能也需要一些调整。
- The OrchidBed Bed, the BreakFaster Chair, that'll probably need some adjustment as well.

194
00:22:59,029 --> 00:23:06,689
我们可以……下载你的OrchidBed坐标到BreakFaster，调整EatWare参数，我们应该会非常接近。
We can... download your OrchidBed co-ordinates into the BreakFaster, tweak the EatWare parameters, and we should be very close.

195
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:15,611
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

196
00:23:17,787 --> 00:23:19,354
路由器。
Router.

197
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:20,921
它是什么?
What is it?

198
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:24,838
-坦瑟先生在这里有一个萨克小队。
- Mr. Tenser has a Sark unit here.

199
00:23:32,628 --> 00:23:34,195
是的。
Yes.

200
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,197
他确实。
He really does.

201
00:23:50,994 --> 00:23:55,608
萨克号验尸舱是我们做过的最好的验尸舱之一。它是美丽的。
- The Sark autopsy module was one of the best units we ever made. It's gorgeous.

202
00:23:55,651 --> 00:23:57,218
他们是传奇。
They're legendary.

203
00:23:57,261 --> 00:23:58,741
如此复杂。
So complex.

204
00:23:58,785 --> 00:24:00,351
所以微妙。
So subtle.

205
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:03,485
-你用过这个吗?
- Do you ever work on one of these?

206
00:24:03,529 --> 00:24:05,705
-他们在我们的时代之前就停止制造了。
- They stopped making them before our time.

207
00:24:05,748 --> 00:24:07,968
我从没见过真人。
I've never seen one in the flesh before.

208
00:24:08,011 --> 00:24:10,013
——他们是传奇。
- They're legendary.

209
00:24:10,623 --> 00:24:12,320
-你用它做什么?
- What do you use it for?

210
00:24:12,668 --> 00:24:14,888
你不是做尸检的吧?
You're not in the autopsy business, are you?

211
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:17,325
-这是我的画笔。
- It's my paint brush.

212
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:26,470
嗯。
Hm.

213
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:30,387
我的天啊，看看这个。
Mm, oh, my God, look at this thing.

214
00:27:37,873 --> 00:27:39,483
不,你不能。
No, you can't.

215
00:27:43,313 --> 00:27:44,837
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

216
00:27:46,055 --> 00:27:47,622
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

217
00:27:51,321 --> 00:27:52,845
-没那么小。
- It's not that small.

218
00:27:54,585 --> 00:27:56,065
-实际上相当大。
- Quite big, actually.

219
00:27:56,109 --> 00:27:57,632
嗯。
Hm.

220
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,113
你介意我问你一些私人问题吗?
- Do you mind if I ask you something intimate?

221
00:28:01,331 --> 00:28:02,855
嗨。
Hi.

222
00:28:02,898 --> 00:28:04,465
不,请便。
No, go ahead.

223
00:28:09,122 --> 00:28:10,776
-手术就是做爱，对吧?
- That surgery is sex, isn't it?

224
00:28:11,602 --> 00:28:13,082
是吗?
Is it?

225
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:14,693
嗯。
Hm.

226
00:28:14,736 --> 00:28:16,259
你知道的。
You know it is.

227
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,436
手术是新的性爱。
Surgery is the new sex.

228
00:28:20,394 --> 00:28:21,917
嗯。
Hm.

229
00:28:21,961 --> 00:28:23,745
一定要有新的性爱吗?
Does there have to be new sex?

230
00:28:23,789 --> 00:28:25,355
是的。
Yes.

231
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,575
是的,它是。
Yes, it's time.

232
00:28:28,141 --> 00:28:33,407
当我看着卡普瑞斯切入你的时候，我想…
When I was watching Caprice cut into you, I wanted...

233
00:28:36,192 --> 00:28:37,716
是吗?
Yes?

234
00:28:39,935 --> 00:28:42,155
-我想让你切入我。
- I wanted you to be cutting into me.

235
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,984
那时我就知道了。
That's when I knew.

236
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,074
嗯。
Hm.

237
00:28:53,427 --> 00:28:54,950
——嗯?
- Hm?

238
00:28:54,994 --> 00:28:56,560
-那是怎么回事?
- What was that all about?

239
00:28:58,824 --> 00:29:00,390
-又一次顿悟。
- Just another epiphany.

240
00:29:02,001 --> 00:29:03,916
艺术再次获得胜利。
Art triumphs once again.

241
00:29:05,918 --> 00:29:07,484
嗯。
Hm.

242
00:29:09,095 --> 00:29:12,272
-他的身体需求是微妙的，而且在不断变化。
- His body needs are subtle and they're constantly shifting.

243
00:29:12,707 --> 00:29:22,804
我和丹尼·鲁特都觉得，坦瑟这个账户会让我们整个组织进入一个全新的，令人振奋的领域。
We feel, Danny Router and I do, that the Tenser account will force our entire organization into new, exhilarating territory.

244
00:29:22,848 --> 00:29:26,677
扫罗紧张是……内心风景的艺术家。
Saul Tenser is... an artist of the inner landscape.

245
00:29:27,678 --> 00:29:34,381
艺术创作常常与疼痛联系在一起，而疼痛，正如我们所知，总是与睡眠联系在一起。
Creation of art is often associated with pain, and pain, as we know, is always associated with sleep.

246
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:51,528
我们在LifeFormWare专门操纵和调节艺术家的痛苦，对我们来说，Saul Tenser是最大的挑战，如此亲密和涉及他的艺术，和他的痛苦的性质。
We at LifeFormWare specialize in manipulating and modulating the pain of artists, and, to us, Saul Tenser is the greatest challenge, so intimate and involving in his art, and the nature of his pain.

247
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:58,187
睡个好觉是…当你是一个寻求痛苦的艺术家时，很难定义。
A good night's sleep is a... hard thing to define when you're an artist and you seek pain.

248
00:30:51,197 --> 00:30:52,763
嗯。
Hm.

249
00:31:01,381 --> 00:31:02,904
坐
Sit down.

250
00:31:07,866 --> 00:31:09,389
我是侦探应付。
I'm Detective Cope.

251
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:10,956
我是新Vice的。
I'm with New Vice.

252
00:31:11,913 --> 00:31:13,436
和你是谁?
And you are?

253
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,395
——Wippet。——Timlin。
- Wippet. - Timlin.

254
00:31:15,438 --> 00:31:17,440
嗯,是的,很好。
Hm, yes, good.

255
00:31:17,484 --> 00:31:22,097
你最近和行为艺术家索尔·坦瑟有来往吗?
Have you had recent dealings with the performance artist, Saul Tenser?

256
00:31:24,447 --> 00:31:25,971
是的。
Yes.

257
00:31:27,407 --> 00:31:33,804
-你有他开发和切除的所有新器官的文件夹吗?
- And you have a portfolio of all the neo-organs which he has developed and removed?

258
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:39,854
-他捐赠给我们的
- He donated it to us.

259
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:47,383
他是第一个对自己内心的创作进行记录和存档的人。
He was the first to undertake the logging, the archiving, of his inner creations.

260
00:31:47,818 --> 00:31:50,604
我们称之为张力组织学。
We call it the Tenser Organography.

261
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:55,914
对他来说，这是一件艺术的事情，一个艺术家想要系统化地记录他的艺术。
For him, it was an art thing, an artist wanting a systematized record of his art.

262
00:31:58,003 --> 00:32:07,403
-但是，对我们来说，它引发了对流动的意识，对许多人正在秘密经历的这些自发生长的意义的意识。
- But, for us, it triggered an awareness of the flow, the significance of these spontaneous growths which many people were experiencing in secret.

263
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:12,539
所以，现在，我们实际上要求对这些增长进行合法登记。
So, now, we have actually required the legal registering of these growths.

264
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:19,415
-注册一个真正的，新的…索尔紧张内部器官…-这就像发现一种新的动物物种。
- The registering of a genuine, new... Saul Tenser internal organ... - It's like discovering a new species of animal.

265
00:32:20,112 --> 00:32:23,376
更像是发现了一个新的毕加索。
Well, more like discovering a new Picasso.

266
00:32:25,073 --> 00:32:27,815
-肿瘤生长怎么会被认为是艺术?
- How can a tumorous growth be considered art?

267
00:32:29,556 --> 00:32:35,692
一切艺术的基础——情感的塑造、哲学的理解在哪里?
Where is the emotional shaping, the philosophical understanding, which is basic to all art?

268
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,003
看……
Look...

269
00:32:44,136 --> 00:32:46,399
我腹部有个肿块。
I have a lump on my abdomen.

270
00:32:49,054 --> 00:32:50,620
你看到了吗?
You see it?

271
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:53,754
毕加索?
Picasso?

272
00:32:53,797 --> 00:32:55,321
杜尚吗?
Duchamp?

273
00:32:56,061 --> 00:32:57,584
弗朗西斯·培根,可能吗?
Francis Bacon, perhaps?

274
00:32:59,151 --> 00:33:00,717
我是艺术家吗?
Am I an artist?

275
00:33:06,941 --> 00:33:10,466
-他对自己的身体进行反叛并控制它。
- He takes the rebellion of his own body and seizes control of it.

276
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:17,212
塑造它，纹身，展示它，用它创造戏剧。
Shapes it, tattoos it, displays it, creates theatre out of it.

277
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:23,479
它有意义，非常有力的意义，而且……很多很多人对此做出了回应。
It has meaning, very potent meaning, and... many, many people respond to it.

278
00:33:23,523 --> 00:33:25,046
——是的。
- Yes.

279
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:27,614
纹身吗?
Tattoos it?

280
00:33:28,571 --> 00:33:30,095
我们开始吧。
Here we go.

281
00:33:32,314 --> 00:33:33,881
嗯。
Hm.

282
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:35,448
你看到了什么?
You see?

283
00:33:35,491 --> 00:33:44,674
从一开始，在他遇到卡布里斯之后，他所有的新器官都在他体内纹上了。
See, right from the beginning, after he met Caprice, all his neo-organs were tattooed while they were still inside his body.

284
00:33:45,284 --> 00:33:46,850
-反复无常是他的情人?
- Caprice is his lover?

285
00:33:47,373 --> 00:33:49,027
-反复无常是他的表演搭档。
- Caprice is his performance partner.

286
00:33:50,202 --> 00:33:51,768
她做纹身。
She does the tattoos.

287
00:33:52,378 --> 00:33:53,944
和手术。
And the surgery.

288
00:33:54,641 --> 00:33:56,164
嗯。
Hm.

289
00:34:05,869 --> 00:34:08,220
在我看来，卡布里斯就是艺术家。
Looks to me as though Caprice is the artist.

290
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:11,005
坦瑟只是个被美化过的器官捐赠者。
Tenser is just a glorified organ donor.

291
00:34:14,791 --> 00:34:17,620
-有表演。
- Well, there are the performances.

292
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:21,102
然后，然后，就有了意志的问题。
And, then-then, there is the question of will.

293
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,586
会吗?
Will?

294
00:34:26,629 --> 00:34:28,153
是的。
Yes.

295
00:34:28,718 --> 00:34:36,161
我们相信，在某种程度上，也许是潜意识，索尔·坦瑟会让这些新器官生长。
We believe, that on a certain level, perhaps a subconscious one, Saul Tenser wills these new organs to grow.

296
00:34:37,727 --> 00:34:39,251
所以…
So...

297
00:34:42,732 --> 00:34:46,301
嗯，你真的应该去看看你腹部的肿块。
Hm, you really ought to get that lump on your abdomen looked at.

298
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,758
扫罗?
Saul?

299
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:11,283
索尔，亲爱的，你能醒醒吗?
Saul, darling, can you wake up?

300
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:17,854
你的床上写着你在研究新东西。
Your bed says that you're working on something new.

301
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,856
这是对的吗?
Can that be right?

302
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:22,032
这么快?
So soon?

303
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,513
-床很安静。
- The bed is very quiet.

304
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:28,691
这张床永远不会出错。
The bed is never wrong.

305
00:35:32,956 --> 00:35:35,655
问问我们在LifeFormWare的朋友就知道了。
Just ask our friends at LifeFormWare.

306
00:35:38,788 --> 00:35:40,703
-这是我们该担心的吗?
- Is this something we should worry about?

307
00:35:42,575 --> 00:35:45,360
增长的间隔似乎正在缩短。
The interval between growths seems to be closing up.

308
00:35:45,752 --> 00:35:47,884
-我觉得很有创意。
- I'm feeling very creative.

309
00:35:49,277 --> 00:35:50,844
我猜。
I guess.

310
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:56,415
我们得快点切了。
We'll just have to start cutting faster.

311
00:36:04,205 --> 00:36:06,729
-是时候停止约会了。
- It is time to stop seeing.

312
00:36:11,865 --> 00:36:14,737
是时候停止说话了。
It is time to stop speaking.

313
00:36:19,351 --> 00:36:22,484
是时候倾听了。
It is time to listen.

314
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:21,978
-我不喜欢耳朵。
- I don't like the ears.

315
00:37:25,678 --> 00:37:27,245
什么?
What?

316
00:37:27,288 --> 00:37:28,811
的耳朵。
The ears.

317
00:37:29,595 --> 00:37:34,730
它们很可爱，很引人注目，但一千只耳朵可不是什么好设计。
They're cute, they're striking, but a thousand ears is not good design.

318
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:37,516
环绕声吗?
Surround sound?

319
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:40,388
多余的耳朵根本不管用。
The extra ears don't even work.

320
00:37:40,736 --> 00:37:42,303
它们只是作秀而已。
They're just for show.

321
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:44,610
-你怎么知道?
- How do you know?

322
00:37:44,653 --> 00:37:46,264
我是阿德里安娜摇篮。
I'm Adrienne Berceau.

323
00:37:47,177 --> 00:37:49,571
我是Klinek的生物形态学协调员。
I'm Klinek's Biomorphology Coordinator.

324
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:57,275
别告诉他是我说的，他跳舞比概念艺术更在行。
Don't tell him I said this, but he's better with the dancing than he is with the conceptual art.

325
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,019
你在研究什么新东西吗，坦瑟先生?
Are you working on anything new, Mr. Tenser?

326
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:07,285
-我真的不知道我什么时候在做新东西。
- I never really know when I'm working on something new.

327
00:38:08,677 --> 00:38:10,592
这似乎不是我能决定的。
It doesn't seem to be my decision.

328
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:12,725
如果是呢?
What if it is?

329
00:38:15,205 --> 00:38:16,729
如果它是吗?
If it is?

330
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:19,949
-内在美的创造不可能是偶然的。
- The creation of inner beauty cannot be an accident.

331
00:38:20,428 --> 00:38:22,648
原谅我引用了你和你的节目。
Forgive me for quoting you and your show.

332
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,001
你听说过纳萨蒂尔医生吗?
Have you heard of Dr. Nasatir?

333
00:38:29,481 --> 00:38:31,047
不。
No.

334
00:38:34,007 --> 00:38:35,922
-你应该去拜访他。
- You should pay him a visit.

335
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:40,970
内在美是他的专长，也是你的专长。
Inner beauty is his specialty, as it is yours.

336
00:38:45,888 --> 00:38:47,499
我已经为你预约了。
I've booked you an appointment.

337
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:49,588
去写在这里的地址。
Go to the address written here.

338
00:38:52,721 --> 00:38:55,376
-关于医疗问题的咨询?
- A consultation about a medical problem?

339
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:57,944
-关于政治问题的咨询。
- A consultation about a political problem.

340
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:32,282
-我有个想法。
- I have a concept for you.

341
00:39:32,326 --> 00:39:33,849
是吗?
Yeah?

342
00:39:33,893 --> 00:39:35,416
是的,是的。
Yeah, yeah.

343
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:39,855
当我看到你在你的节目中使用萨克小队时，我就想到了。
It came to me when I saw you use a Sark unit as part of your show.

344
00:39:39,899 --> 00:39:41,814
萨克号最初是一个解剖舱。
The Sark was originally an autopsy module.

345
00:39:41,857 --> 00:39:43,468
你知道吗?
Did you know that?

346
00:39:43,511 --> 00:39:45,078
我知道。
I knew that.

347
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,951
-你有没有想过用它来做真正的尸检?
- Have you ever thought about using it for a real autopsy?

348
00:39:48,995 --> 00:39:50,518
作为你节目的一部分?
As part of your show?

349
00:39:52,041 --> 00:39:53,565
进行尸检?
Perform an autopsy?

350
00:39:53,608 --> 00:39:55,349
-在尸体上。嗯嗯。
- On a corpse. Mm-hm.

351
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:57,046
我有一具尸体给你。
I have a corpse for you.

352
00:39:57,090 --> 00:39:58,613
这是一具非常特别的尸体。
It's a very special corpse.

353
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:02,225
你可以在尸体上做活体解剖。
You could do a live autopsy on a dead body.

354
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:05,315
而且会有惊喜。我保证会有惊喜的。
And there would be surprises. I can guarantee a few surprises.

355
00:40:05,359 --> 00:40:07,274
-你说的是什么尸体?
- What corpse are you talking about?

356
00:40:07,927 --> 00:40:09,450
我的儿子。
My son.

357
00:40:09,494 --> 00:40:11,017
八岁。
Eight years old.

358
00:40:13,585 --> 00:40:15,238
-为什么他是一具尸体?
- Why is he a corpse?

359
00:40:15,282 --> 00:40:19,155
-他母亲杀了他。不会是…是演出的好原料吗?
- His mother murdered him. Wouldn't that be... good raw material for a performance?

360
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,379
-你有你儿子的尸体?
- You have the body of your son?

361
00:40:25,945 --> 00:40:28,469
-是的，我当然有我儿子的尸体
- Yes, of course I have the body of my son.

362
00:40:28,513 --> 00:40:30,036
他是我的儿子。
He's my son.

363
00:40:31,037 --> 00:40:32,560
哇。
Wow.

364
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:34,170
是的,我知道。
Yeah, I know.

365
00:40:35,215 --> 00:40:37,043
我是说，你有多激进?
I mean, how radical are you?

366
00:40:37,086 --> 00:40:38,827
嗯?
Hm?

367
00:40:38,871 --> 00:40:40,786
你害怕一点点情绪吗?
Are you afraid of a little emotion?

368
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:44,311
-我什么都怕。
- I'm afraid of everything.

369
00:40:56,584 --> 00:41:02,416
今天喉咙的问题很严重。
The throat thing is very severe today.

370
00:41:02,764 --> 00:41:04,331
我打不开。
I can't open it.

371
00:41:05,245 --> 00:41:06,768
这是怎么呢
What's going on?

372
00:41:09,075 --> 00:41:10,598
我不确定。
I am not sure.

373
00:41:13,340 --> 00:41:15,995
-你昨天睡了很长时间。
- You were out for a very long time yesterday.

374
00:41:16,038 --> 00:41:17,562
是的。
Yeah.

375
00:41:18,345 --> 00:41:19,868
不是我过敏。
It's not my allergies.

376
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:25,004
事实上，它们并没有打扰到我。
In fact, they're not bothering me.

377
00:41:25,047 --> 00:41:26,919
——这是奇怪的。
- It's strange.

378
00:41:27,397 --> 00:41:28,921
-你不舒服吗?
- Are you in discomfort?

379
00:41:28,964 --> 00:41:32,315
不,这是一个…引人注目的丰满。
No, it's a... compelling fullness.

380
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:35,884
这种感觉还不错。
Not a completely bad feeling.

381
00:41:36,624 --> 00:41:40,672
-至少不是…无趣的。
- At least not... uninteresting.

382
00:41:43,283 --> 00:41:45,198
我去看了Klinek。
I went to see the Klinek.

383
00:41:46,286 --> 00:41:47,809
它怎么样?
How was it?

384
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:49,768
——一般。
- The usual.

385
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,120
-挤满了人。
- It was packed.

386
00:41:55,208 --> 00:41:56,731
嫉妒?
Jealous?

387
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:59,473
当然可以。
Of course.

388
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,606
-但不是这样的。
- But that's not it.

389
00:42:01,649 --> 00:42:03,216
我见过一个人…
I met this guy...

390
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,220
-在街上。
- On the street.

391
00:42:07,263 --> 00:42:11,137
他有一个表演的想法。
He had an idea for a show.

392
00:42:19,972 --> 00:42:23,105
所以，我就是那男孩的尸体。
So, I'm the boy's corpse.

393
00:42:24,411 --> 00:42:26,065
我们得改装一下萨克号。
We'll have to modify the Sark.

394
00:42:26,108 --> 00:42:27,632
嗯。
Hm.

395
00:42:27,675 --> 00:42:29,895
-把它变回一个解剖模块。
- Convert it back into an autopsy module.

396
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:37,467
-我不知道关于侮辱人类遗体的法律在哪里。
- I don't know where the law is on acts degrading to human remains.

397
00:42:40,688 --> 00:42:43,691
我们要做得出格才值得。
We'll have to be outrageous to make it worthwhile.

398
00:42:45,954 --> 00:42:47,521
我们必须深入。
We have to go deep.

399
00:42:59,489 --> 00:43:02,623
我不确定我们要怎么从内在美的角度出发。
I'm not sure how we'd play the inner beauty angle.

400
00:43:02,667 --> 00:43:06,671
这个叫Dotrice的家伙说会有惊喜——哦。
This guy, Dotrice, he said there'd be surprises... - Oops.

401
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,369
——哦。——对不起。
- Oh. - Sorry.

402
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:11,066
-那是机器在说话。
- That was the machinery talking.

403
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:13,373
-那是你说的
- That was you talking.

404
00:43:15,636 --> 00:43:17,333
继续。
Keep going.

405
00:43:19,248 --> 00:43:20,772
真的吗?
Really?

406
00:43:21,468 --> 00:43:24,993
到目前为止…很好。
So far... so good.

407
00:43:33,132 --> 00:43:34,655
哦……
Oh...

408
00:43:37,745 --> 00:43:42,750
哦……哦!哦……
Oh... Oh! Oh...

409
00:43:46,928 --> 00:43:49,975
-你可以进入下一场演出。
- You could be on the inside for the next show.

410
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:51,890
也许吧。
Maybe.

411
00:43:53,805 --> 00:43:57,156
但也许这只是为了我们。

嗯。
Huh.

416
00:45:25,592 --> 00:45:27,899
你的想象力在加班加点地工作。

417
00:45:29,509 --> 00:45:31,685
-我只是想看看你的作品集

关于身体艺术，我想说的是我不喜欢身体上发生的事情。
What I'm saying with that body-art stuff is that I don't like what's happening with the body.

432
00:46:17,252 --> 00:46:18,906
-她不能读懂你的内心?
- She can't read your insides?

433
00:46:19,864 --> 00:46:23,345
没有任何卧底的痕迹吗?

那正是你的拿手好戏。
That's right up your alley.

450
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:21,839
我猜这就是她找我的原因

451
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:24,929

00:54:30,832 --> 00:54:32,573
它只是一个功能性的东西。
It's just a functional thing.

554
00:54:34,227 --> 00:54:35,750
这是一个带拉链的苍蝇;
It's a zippered fly;

555
00:54:35,794 --> 00:54:37,448
这不是艺术，也不是感性的。
it's not art, It's not sensual.

556
00:54:39,624 --> 00:54:46,848
此外，记住性爱就是手术。
Besides, remember what sex is surgery.

557
00:54:48,154 --> 00:54:49,982
一个拉链代替不了我们的萨克。
A zipper can't replace our Sark.

558
00:54:51,679 --> 00:54:55,640
我想她说，呃…“手术就是新的性爱。”
I think she said, uh... "Surgery is the new sex."

559
00:55:03,256 --> 00:55:04,779
除此之外,
Besides,

560
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:15,964
——拉链……拥有自己的性感。
- zippers... - have their own sex appeal.

561
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:34,505
小心……不泄漏。
Careful... don't spill.

562
00:55:54,873 --> 00:55:56,875
-他吃了一个塑料废纸篓。
- He ate a plastic wastepaper basket.

563
00:55:56,918 --> 00:55:58,833
你会怎么做?
What would you do?

564
00:55:59,878 --> 00:56:01,401
-我不会杀他的
- I wouldn't kill him.

565
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,664
一个小孩，我自己的儿子。
A little kid, my own son.

566
00:56:03,708 --> 00:56:05,753
-但他不会是你自己的儿子
- But he wouldn't be your own son.

567
00:56:05,797 --> 00:56:07,712
他都不是个小孩子了。
He wouldn't even be a little kid.

568
00:56:08,452 --> 00:56:10,018
-他会是什么?
- What would he be?

569
00:56:10,062 --> 00:56:11,585
一个生物。
A creature.

570
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:13,892
一个东西。
A thing.

571
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:16,416
是我丈夫发明来折磨我的。
A thing my husband invented to torment me.

572
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:19,854
-一个可以吃掉塑料废纸篓的东西。
- A thing that can eat a plastic wastepaper basket.

573
00:56:19,898 --> 00:56:21,552
-吃它，享受它。
- Eat it and enjoy it.

574
00:56:21,595 --> 00:56:24,076
只吃塑料和奇怪的合成材料。
And eat nothing but plastic and weird synthetic stuff.

575
00:56:28,994 --> 00:56:31,649
他会把那块表拿去当午餐。
He would take that watch and he'd have it for lunch.

576
00:56:33,215 --> 00:56:35,043
-他能消化塑料?
- He could digest plastic?

577
00:56:35,087 --> 00:56:42,529
他有一种奇怪的、厚厚的白色流口水，他有时会对着一切东西发出啧啧声。
He had this weird, thick white drool that he'd sometimes slurp over everything.

578
00:56:42,573 --> 00:56:44,575
就像酸一样。
It was like acid.

579
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:47,186
它能溶解任何塑料物质。
It'd dissolve any kind of plasticky stuff.

580
00:56:47,229 --> 00:56:49,754
如果你把它弄到皮肤上就会刺痛。
It would sting if you got it on your skin.

581
00:56:49,797 --> 00:56:51,625
但他没在意。
Didn't bother him, though.

582
00:56:51,669 --> 00:56:53,235
蜥蜴。
That lizard.

583
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:57,457
-你丈夫是朗·多特里丝
- Your husband is Lang Dotrice.

584
00:56:57,501 --> 00:56:59,024
是什么。
Was.

585
00:56:59,067 --> 00:57:01,548
是我的丈夫。我和他断绝了关系——操他。
Was my husband. I've disowned him - fuck him.

586
00:57:01,592 --> 00:57:03,420
-他发明了你的儿子?
- He invented your son?

587
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:06,248
是的。
Yeah.

588
00:57:06,292 --> 00:57:07,946
这就是我的看法。
That's how I think of it.

589
00:57:07,989 --> 00:57:14,431
还有一件事一想到在我体内生长的黏糊糊的虫子我就恶心。
And here's another thing the thought of that slimy worm growing in me still makes me sick.

590
00:57:15,954 --> 00:57:19,218
警察告诉我他们还没找到你儿子布雷肯。
The police tell me they haven't found your son, Brecken.

591
00:57:19,261 --> 00:57:22,743
我觉得他们不认为你真的杀了他。
I get the feeling they don't think you really killed him.

592
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:27,356
我承认他们不相信我。
I confess they don't believe me.

593
00:57:28,227 --> 00:57:29,881
完美的犯罪。
The perfect crime.

594
00:57:32,013 --> 00:57:33,537
你承认吗?
You confessed?

595
00:57:33,580 --> 00:57:35,060
是的。
Yeah.

596
00:57:35,103 --> 00:57:36,757
为什么?
Why?

597
00:57:37,758 --> 00:57:39,325
我有罪。
I'm guilty.

598
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:47,464
身体在哪里?
Where's the body?

599
00:57:47,507 --> 00:57:49,857
-朗拿走了，除非他把它扔了。
- Lang has it unless he's thrown it away.

600
00:57:49,901 --> 00:57:51,468
-他怎么拿到的?
- How'd he get it?

601
00:57:54,253 --> 00:57:55,776
-我留给他的
- I left it for him.

602
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,126
我的离婚小礼物。
My little divorce present.

603
00:58:01,913 --> 00:58:04,393
-朗要怎么处理尸体?
- What is Lang going to do with the body?

604
00:58:04,437 --> 00:58:06,700
-也许他和他的食人族朋友会吃掉它。
- Maybe him and his cannibal friends are going to eat it.

605
00:58:06,744 --> 00:58:08,833
谁他妈知道?谁他妈在乎?
Who the fuck knows? Who the fuck cares?

606
00:58:08,876 --> 00:58:10,617
-他的朋友都是食人族?
- His friends are cannibals?

607
00:58:10,661 --> 00:58:12,227
——嗯。
- Um-hm.

608
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:17,189
如果你是芭比娃娃，那他们就是食人族。
If you're a Barbie Doll, then they're cannibals.

609
00:58:18,103 --> 00:58:25,066
-如果警察找到布雷肯的尸体并进行尸检，你认为他们会在里面发现什么?
- If the police found Brecken's body and did an autopsy, what do you think they'd find inside it?

610
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:29,593
外太空。
Outer space.

611
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,051
——塔尔。——朗。
- Tarr. - Lang.

612
00:58:53,094 --> 00:58:54,618
每个人都在这里。
Everybody's here.

613
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,794
好。
Good.

614
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:07,848
-我们的补给线又开始运行了，所以我们的状况很好。
- Our supply lines are up and running again, so we're in very good shape.

615
00:59:07,892 --> 00:59:09,807
生产很快就会恢复到最高水平。
Production will soon be back to maximum.

616
00:59:20,948 --> 00:59:27,215
-塔尔，如果我们要搬迁公社，我是说，整个运作，流水线，所有的一切…坐下。
- Tarr, if we have to move the commune, I mean, the whole operation, the assembly line, everything... Sit.

617
00:59:27,259 --> 00:59:28,739
它能有多快?
How quickly can it be?

618
00:59:28,782 --> 00:59:30,349
-你以为会有问题吗?
- You're expecting problems?

619
00:59:32,307 --> 00:59:34,527
-我要继续做布雷肯的尸检。
- I'm going ahead with the Brecken autopsy.

620
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:42,230
最后，我们所做的将会是非常公开的，它将会引起共鸣。
Finally, what we're doing is going to be very public and it's going to resonate.

621
01:00:48,557 --> 01:00:50,081
哦……
Oh...

622
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,004
哦。
Oh.

623
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:01,701
紧张先生在哪儿?
Where's Mr. Tenser?

624
01:01:03,442 --> 01:01:05,226
-他在做一些研究。——啊。
- He's doing some research. - Ah.

625
01:01:05,836 --> 01:01:07,620
-你的朋友蒂姆林呢?
- Where's your friend, Timlin?

626
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:10,405
-她被吓到了
- Oh, she was, uh, intimidated.

627
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:11,972
由谁?
By whom?

628
01:01:12,016 --> 01:01:15,454
我们被禁止交往。
Well, we've been forbidden to mingle.

629
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:17,412
现在这是工作描述的一部分。
It's now part of the job description.

630
01:01:18,544 --> 01:01:25,943
我来这里就拿我的职业生涯冒险，但是…我不能离开。
I'm risking my career just being here, but, uh... I can't stay away.

631
01:01:26,508 --> 01:01:28,032
我发烧了。
I've got the fever.

632
01:01:29,381 --> 01:01:30,904
原谅我。
Forgive me.

633
01:01:30,948 --> 01:01:33,428
我得在她走之前跟她谈谈。
I've got to talk to her before she goes.

634
01:01:40,305 --> 01:01:41,828
至理名言。
Odile.

635
01:01:43,917 --> 01:01:45,484
反复无常。
Caprice.

636
01:01:46,746 --> 01:01:55,015
你不知道我有多难找到能理解我不想变得更漂亮的整形医生。
Oh, you have no idea how hard it's been for me to find plastic surgeons who understand that I do not wish to be made more beautiful.

637
01:01:55,624 --> 01:01:59,063
-外科医生往往非常专注，缺乏想象力。
- Surgeons tend to be very focussed and unimaginative.

638
01:01:59,803 --> 01:02:01,369
这被认为是一种力量。
It's considered a strength.

639
01:02:03,197 --> 01:02:04,721
我自己就是个外科医生。
I was a surgeon myself.

640
01:02:05,504 --> 01:02:07,027
但不是整容手术。
Not cosmetic surgery, though.

641
01:02:07,854 --> 01:02:09,421
——创伤。
- Trauma.

642
01:02:11,510 --> 01:02:13,033
创伤。
Trauma.

643
01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:16,776
但这是非常……挑衅。
But that's very um... provocative.

644
01:02:17,516 --> 01:02:19,039
我喜欢创伤。
I enjoy trauma.

645
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:22,347
我对自己的所作所为让我深受创伤。
What I do to myself is very traumatic.

646
01:02:23,391 --> 01:02:24,915
是吗?
Is it?

647
01:02:25,524 --> 01:02:30,747
你看起来很平静，所以…在你做手术的时候感到幸福。
You seem so peaceful, so... beatific while your surgery's going on.

648
01:02:32,531 --> 01:02:37,362
看你突然……我充满了想把脸割开的欲望。
Watching you suddenly... filled me with the desire to cut my face open.

649
01:02:40,017 --> 01:02:41,714
这种感觉让我震惊。
It's a feeling that shocked me.

650
01:02:44,543 --> 01:02:52,333
-对开放的渴望通常是令人兴奋的... ...新事物的开始。
- A desire to be open is often the beginning of something exciting... ...new.

651
01:02:55,815 --> 01:03:02,343
也许你愿意今晚晚些时候和我以及剧团一起去酒店?
Perhaps you would like to join me and the troupe later this evening, at the hotel?

652
01:03:06,913 --> 01:03:08,872
-想要敞开心扉?
- A desire to be open?

653
01:03:11,135 --> 01:03:12,701
比喻。
Metaphorically.

654
01:03:12,745 --> 01:03:14,312
的情绪。
Emotionally.

655
01:03:14,355 --> 01:03:15,879
在艺术上。
Artistically.

656
01:03:29,893 --> 01:03:32,504
-你想接管布雷肯的节目。
- You want to take over the Brecken show.

657
01:03:32,547 --> 01:03:34,636
-我想做尸检。
- I want to perform the autopsy.

658
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,203
我想表演。
I want to perform.

659
01:03:43,732 --> 01:03:45,256
-这是新的
- Well, this is new.

660
01:03:46,735 --> 01:03:48,259
-是的。
- Yes, it is.

661
01:03:54,047 --> 01:03:58,008
也许……你以前太害羞了。
Maybe... you were too shy before.

662
01:04:00,184 --> 01:04:01,838
-我现在不太害羞了。
- I'm not too shy now.

663
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:08,801
你会为这个节目带来一些新的东西吗?
Will you have something new for the show?

664
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:11,673
我们完全可以用张紧器进行提取。
We could definitely do work in a Tenser extraction.

665
01:04:12,979 --> 01:04:14,546
解剖的两倍。
Double Autopsy.

666
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:16,113
嗯。
Hm.

667
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:17,984
我确实做了点东西。
I do have something cooking.

668
01:04:20,682 --> 01:04:22,206
也许有一些事情。
Maybe a few things.

669
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:26,732
但我很乐意让他们暂时待在屋里。
But I'm happy to let them stay inside for now.

670
01:04:26,775 --> 01:04:28,560
-那可能不健康
- That might not be healthy.

671
01:04:30,997 --> 01:04:35,132
-如果有问题，我们可以私下撤离。
- We can extract in private, if it's a problem.

672
01:04:35,915 --> 01:04:37,569
不一定是表演。
Doesn't have to be a performance.

673
01:04:38,265 --> 01:04:40,180
-不要拖太久。
- Don't let it go too long.

674
01:04:52,801 --> 01:04:54,325
- Odile的表演怎么样?

675
01:04:56,544 --> 01:05:00,244
这是……——聪明的。

676
01:05:01,158 --> 01:05:02,899
她是令人振奋的。
She's exhilarating.

677
01:05:02,942 --> 01:05:04,465
是的。
Yeah.

01:05:04,988 --> 01:05:06,511
-她说你好。
- She says hello.

679
01:05:08,861 --> 01:05:10,602
你好。
Hello.

680
01:05:11,820 --> 01:05:13,997
-我想做的不仅仅是表演。
- I want to do more than perform.

681
01:05:15,520 --> 01:05:17,043
我想要构建。
I want to construct.

682
01:05:18,131 --> 01:05:20,177
我想建造布雷肯秀。
I want to construct the Brecken show.

683
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,266
-它已经有了一个先天的结构。
- It already has an innate structure.

684
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,399
一个被谋杀的男孩。
A murdered boy.

685
01:05:25,443 --> 01:05:26,966
一个非常奇怪的男孩。
A very strange boy.

686
01:05:27,662 --> 01:05:30,839
公开尸检，一些…惊喜。
A public autopsy, some... surprises.

687
01:05:30,883 --> 01:05:32,798
-我想和它合作。
- I want to work with it.

688
01:05:33,407 --> 01:05:34,974
它充满了意义。
It's juicy with meaning.

689
01:05:42,982 --> 01:05:44,810
扫罗紧张。
Saul Tenser.

690
01:05:47,552 --> 01:05:50,685
好吧，那进来吧。
Well, then, come on in.

691
01:05:50,729 --> 01:05:52,252
嗯。
Hm.

692
01:05:58,041 --> 01:05:59,564
只是…
Just...

693
01:06:11,924 --> 01:06:13,447
有什么事吗?
What's up?

694
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:20,585
哦,好吧…我只是想听听你对新器官制造者的建议。
Oh, well... I just want your advice as a neo-organ generator.

695
01:06:21,064 --> 01:06:30,029
我…,就…嗯…事实上，我想带你看看我们的安全屋。
I... - just... Uh... actually, I wanted to show you our safe room.

696
01:06:30,073 --> 01:06:31,639
我可以吗?
Can I?

697
01:06:35,556 --> 01:06:43,825
是的……所以，这里是我们存放更刺激素材的地方。
Yes... So, this is where we archive our more provocative material in here.

698
01:06:44,783 --> 01:06:46,654
-我认为这是挑衅。
- I thought it was all provocative.

699
01:06:48,265 --> 01:06:51,790
你，你激怒了我们。
You, - you provoke us.

700
01:06:52,138 --> 01:06:56,229
——嗯…你，你激怒了我。
- Uh... You, you provoke me.

701
01:06:57,230 --> 01:07:01,147
我很高兴你能和我们在一起。
I'm-- I'm just so glad you're with us, you know.

702
01:07:01,191 --> 01:07:03,236
这在情感上很有意义。
It makes such emotional sense.

703
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:06,544
我们是谁?
Who's us?

704
01:07:08,154 --> 01:07:11,331
是我,我…我是一个。
It's me, I'm... I'm the one.

705
01:07:11,375 --> 01:07:14,813
我是内心选美大赛的注册员。
I am the Registrar for the Inner Beauty Pageant.

706
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:16,771
-嘘，别告诉别人。
- Sh, don't tell.

707
01:07:16,815 --> 01:07:20,297
登记似乎是你的强项。
Registration seems to be your strong suit.

708
01:07:21,515 --> 01:07:25,693
-我觉得你很有可能赢得你的奖项。
- I-I think you have a very good chance of winning your category.

709
01:07:25,737 --> 01:07:29,132
事实上，如果我是你，我会去争取最佳表演奖。
In fact, if I were you, I'd go for Best in Show.

710
01:07:29,175 --> 01:07:31,656
-我不确定我能展示什么。
- I'm not sure I'll have anything to show.

711
01:07:36,443 --> 01:07:38,358
可能得装出来。
Might have to fake it.

712
01:07:41,231 --> 01:07:52,372
-说到假装，我说过和内在美在一起对你来说是有感情意义的，确实如此，但是…你知道，这不合逻辑。
- Speaking of faking it, I said it makes emotional sense for you to be with the Inner Beauties, and it does, but... you know, doesn't make logical sense.

713
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:55,854
——不是吗?——没有。
- No? - No.

714
01:07:55,897 --> 01:07:58,248
-因为“内心选美”的核心是接受。
- Because the Inner Beauty Pageant is all about acceptance.

715
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:09,389
它是关于承认，审美的赋予，而你，索尔·坦瑟，你是关于愤怒，和反叛，和…拒绝了手术刀。
It's about acknowledgment, aesthetic empowerment, And you, Saul Tenser, you're all about anger, and rebellion, and... rejection by scalpel.

716
01:08:16,092 --> 01:08:18,616
-这是个错误，不是吗?
- This has been a mistake, hasn't it?

717
01:08:18,659 --> 01:08:20,096
不。
No.

718
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:23,882
-你说得对。在你的小秘密活动中我会感到很不自在。
- No, you're right. I'd be a fish out of water at your little secret event.

719
01:08:24,448 --> 01:08:26,667
但是，不，不，不。
But, no, no, no.

720
01:08:26,711 --> 01:08:31,281
我们想要你，我们需要你，我们…没有你，一切都会散架的!
We want you, we need you, we-we... It'll all fall apart without you!

721
01:08:34,022 --> 01:08:39,854
-如果我赢得了最佳原创管风琴奖，然后在我下次演出的时候当众把它撕了呢?
- What if I won for best original organ and then I ripped it out in public at my next show?

722
01:08:40,507 --> 01:08:42,205
那不会让你的团队蒙羞吗?
Wouldn't that humiliate your group?

723
01:08:43,728 --> 01:08:46,557
明星效应。我们就就会覆盖它。
It's star power. We'll-we'll-we'll cover it.

724
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:48,167
我们会,我们会解决的。
We'll, we'll settle.

725
01:08:48,211 --> 01:08:53,172
你想要什么我们都会给你也许，只是也许，你会开始以我们的方式看待这件事。
We'll give you whatever you want and maybe, just maybe, you'll begin to see it our way.

726
01:08:55,653 --> 01:09:03,617
——嗯…-所以…好吧…我们倒带。
- Uh... - So-- So, okay... we rewind.

727
01:09:06,925 --> 01:09:12,713
——我…我是来报名参加内心选美比赛的。
- I, uh... I'm here to register for the Inner Beauty Pageant.

728
01:09:18,850 --> 01:09:20,808
——紧张先生吗?——啊!哦。
- Mr. Tenser? - Ah! Oh.

729
01:09:20,852 --> 01:09:22,419
——扫罗……——这是你。
- Saul... - It's you.

730
01:09:24,247 --> 01:09:26,249
你能到我办公室来一下吗?
- Could you come into my office?

731
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:36,084
你刚刚和威佩特先生在一起。
You were just with Mr. Wippet.

732
01:09:37,260 --> 01:09:38,783
我是。
I was.

733
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:41,046
-我很担心他。
- I'm very worried about him.

734
01:09:45,137 --> 01:09:47,748
-他看起来状态不错。
- He seemed to be in fine form.

735
01:09:49,620 --> 01:09:52,666
-不，这是一种非常危险的形式。
- Oh, no, it's a very dangerous form to be in.

736
01:09:55,278 --> 01:09:59,804
-我不明白
- I-- I don't understand.

737
01:10:02,154 --> 01:10:07,725
……在我们这行，很容易被演艺圈的魅力所迷惑，
It's... in our line of work, very easy to be dazzled by the glamour of the performance world,

738
01:10:09,814 --> 01:10:14,210
我们遇到的那些有魅力的人，比如你。
the charismatic people we meet, like you.

739
01:10:19,258 --> 01:10:20,781
我明白了。
I see.

740
01:10:21,695 --> 01:10:23,219
你呢?
Do you?

741
01:10:26,831 --> 01:10:28,354
——也许不是。告诉我。
- Maybe not. Tell me.

742
01:10:30,661 --> 01:10:32,315
-这是我们的世界
- Well, this is our world.

743
01:10:33,316 --> 01:10:34,839
这间办公室，这栋大楼。
This office, this building.

744
01:10:36,449 --> 01:10:44,196
从它的中心，在它的深处，这美丽的白光向外散发。
From the centre of it, deep, deep within it, this beautiful white light emanates outward.

745
01:10:45,371 --> 01:10:51,943
那道光就是你，你所创造的，以及那些喜欢你的人。
That light is you, what you create, and those like you.

746
01:10:54,162 --> 01:11:03,433
…我们这些乏味的官僚小昆虫，很难不被你强大的引力场所吸引。
Mm... It's hard-it's hard for us, drab little bureaucratic insects that we are, not to be drawn into your powerful gravitational field.

747
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:10,309
向你飞奔而来，坠入把所有光都吸进去的黑洞。
Hurtling towards you, plunging into your black hole that pulls all light into it.

748
01:11:12,616 --> 01:11:16,446
我们想追随那道光，与那道光融合。
We want to follow that light, fuse with that light.

749
01:11:17,621 --> 01:11:24,671
-威佩特在做熔合吗-你觉得呢
- Is-- Is Wippet doing some fusing, - do you think?

750
01:11:26,499 --> 01:11:30,851
哦……他被内在美所吸引。
Oh... He's-he is drawn to inner beauty.

751
01:11:33,680 --> 01:11:36,857
-他在和颠覆组织玩游戏吗?
- Is he playing games with subversive groups?

752
01:11:36,901 --> 01:11:38,555
你是这个意思吗?
Is that-is that what you mean?

753
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:50,436
我…我非常非常喜欢他，但是……是啊，我想我可能得告发他了。
I... I am very, very fond of him, but... Yes, I think I might have to actually turn him in.

754
01:11:50,480 --> 01:11:52,699
-不，别，别，别那样
- No, don't-don't-don't do that.

755
01:11:53,352 --> 01:11:55,093
——嗯…
- Uh...

756
01:11:59,793 --> 01:12:01,795
这个房间安全吗?
How safe is this room?

757
01:12:03,231 --> 01:12:07,584
哦,这是……它是完全安全的。
Oh, it's... It's totally safe.

758
01:12:08,062 --> 01:12:09,716
你可以对我坦白。
You can be open with me.

759
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,327
是的,打开。
Yeah, open.

760
01:12:11,588 --> 01:12:23,556
嗯…你有没有遇到过一种新型的风琴……或者更确切地说，是一种具有消化功能的新器官系统?
Um... Have you run across a neo-organ... or rather, a system of neo-organs, that had a digestive function?

761
01:12:23,600 --> 01:12:29,780
一个可以消化合成物、塑料……诸如此类的事情?
A system that can digest synthetics, plastics... that sort of thing?

762
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:31,347
不。
No.

763
01:12:32,130 --> 01:12:34,350
没有，但听起来很有趣。
No, but that sounds interesting.

764
01:12:34,872 --> 01:12:39,790
我们只遇到过单一器官的生长，比如你的。
We've only come across single organ growths here, like yours.

765
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:45,230
当然，没有人知道如果任由这些增长累积会发生什么。
Of course, nobody knows what would happen if those growths were allowed to accumulate.

766
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:54,282
你觉得他们能——呃，我差点说到进化，但我没有。哈。
Do you think they could ev-- Um, I almost said evolve, - but I didn't. Hah.

767
01:12:54,326 --> 01:13:00,201
嗯…你认为他们真的能发展成……器官系统?
Um... Do you think they could actually develop into... a system of organs?

768
01:13:01,333 --> 01:13:05,381
像一个…循环系统,
like a... circulatory system,

769
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:11,561
神经系统,嗯…淋巴……?
nervous system, um... lymphatic...?

770
01:13:12,431 --> 01:13:14,607
-你对人体生理学很了解。
- You know a lot about human physiology.

771
01:13:15,086 --> 01:13:16,609
是的。
Yeah.

772
01:13:19,264 --> 01:13:21,092
——嗯。
- Hm.

773
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,878
-你觉得你会让我参加你的节目吗?
- Do you think you would ever let me be a part of your show?

774
01:13:25,139 --> 01:13:36,629
嗯…因为我很想…发现自己在沙克舱里…你来控制。
Uh... Because I would love to... find myself in that Sark module with... you at the controls.

775
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:42,592
-这绝对是新Vice的范畴。
- That would, that would definitely fall into the category of New Vice.

776
01:13:43,723 --> 01:13:47,771
…嗯，那就是我住的地方。
Mm... Well, that is where I live.

777
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,231
——嗯。
- Hm.

778
01:14:29,160 --> 01:14:30,814
啊。
Ah.

779
01:14:55,969 --> 01:14:58,145
-哦…嗯…
- Oh... Uh...

780
01:15:03,977 --> 01:15:05,501
——我很抱歉。——没有。
- I'm sorry. - No.

781
01:15:07,198 --> 01:15:09,635
-我只是不太擅长老炮友。
- I'm just not very good at the old sex.

782
01:15:27,131 --> 01:15:29,133
-请进。
- Please, come in.

783
01:15:30,961 --> 01:15:32,571
你喜欢坐哪坐哪。
Sit, uh, anywhere you like.

784
01:15:38,882 --> 01:15:40,361
这是反复无常的。
This is Caprice.

785
01:15:40,666 --> 01:15:42,233
她是我的伙伴。
She's my partner.

786
01:15:42,276 --> 01:15:43,930
-是的，我看过你的作品。
- Yes, I've seen your work.

787
01:15:44,801 --> 01:15:46,890
美丽。优秀的东西。
Beautiful. Outstanding stuff.

788
01:15:46,933 --> 01:15:48,500
谢谢你！
Thank you.

789
01:15:48,544 --> 01:15:50,197
-我和你妻子谈过了
- I spoke to your wife.

790
01:15:50,633 --> 01:15:52,156
你的前妻。
Your ex-wife.

791
01:15:54,201 --> 01:15:55,725
-你为什么这么做?
- Why'd you do that?

792
01:15:56,639 --> 01:15:59,206
-我想知道我们在做什么。
- I wanted to know what we were getting into.

793
01:16:00,033 --> 01:16:01,644
-你现在知道了吗?
- Do you know now?

794
01:16:07,171 --> 01:16:08,738
不完全是。
Not exactly.

795
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:11,654
——好的。
- Okay.

796
01:16:12,002 --> 01:16:15,527
-我们就从这个开始吧
- Why don't we, uh, start with this.

797
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:23,883
你不想看看你的原材料吗?
Don't you want to take a look at your raw materials?

798
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:27,234
请。
Please.

799
01:16:38,855 --> 01:16:40,770
-我觉得我们不应该这么做。
- I don't think we should do this.

800
01:16:40,813 --> 01:16:42,380
-也许你不应该这么做。
- Maybe you shouldn't.

801
01:16:46,297 --> 01:16:48,516
-但你显然是想让我们这么做。
- But you obviously really want us to.

802
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,260
你为什么?
Why do you?

803
01:16:56,524 --> 01:16:58,439
-我要发表声明。
- I need to make a statement.

804
01:16:58,831 --> 01:17:00,398
一个非常公开的声明。
A very public statement.

805
01:17:01,007 --> 01:17:02,574
嗯。
Hm.

806
01:17:02,618 --> 01:17:06,796
正式的警方尸检难道不能说明这一点吗?
Wouldn't a formal police autopsy make that statement?

807
01:17:08,841 --> 01:17:11,104
-不，不，会被盖起来的。
- No, no, it would be covered up.

808
01:17:11,148 --> 01:17:12,671
你什么也听不到。
You'd never hear a thing.

809
01:17:24,509 --> 01:17:26,772
-行为艺术都是两厢情愿的。
- Performance art is all consensual.

810
01:17:28,426 --> 01:17:30,036
这次就不一样了。
This one would be different.

811
01:17:31,734 --> 01:17:33,300
这将是不同的。
This would be different.

812
01:17:33,344 --> 01:17:35,259
-是的，我会同意的。
- Yes, well, you'll have my consent.

813
01:17:36,347 --> 01:17:37,870
Brecken不说话。
Brecken isn't talking.

814
01:17:38,784 --> 01:17:42,788
我相信你知道狄娜不在乎她儿子的尸体会怎么样。
I'm sure you realize that Djuna doesn't care what happens to her son's body.

815
01:17:42,832 --> 01:17:45,617
-我感觉她对他的身体很着迷。
- I got the feeling she was obsessed with his body.

816
01:17:47,227 --> 01:17:49,055
尤其是他的消化系统。
Especially his digestive system.

817
01:17:49,099 --> 01:17:51,579
——啊。嗯…
- Ah. Well...

818
01:17:58,499 --> 01:18:00,023
吃过这个吗?
Ever eaten one of these?

819
01:18:03,113 --> 01:18:05,028
-从没见过这种东西。
- Never seen one of those before.

820
01:18:05,332 --> 01:18:06,856
——继续。请。
- Go ahead. Please.

821
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:09,423
我认为这将是一个启示。
I think it'll be a revelation.

822
01:18:21,827 --> 01:18:23,611
-我对食物很挑剔。
- I'm very fussy about my food.

823
01:18:25,091 --> 01:18:27,006
-是啊，我也是
- Yeah, so am I.

824
01:18:27,050 --> 01:18:28,616
Brecken也是。
So was Brecken.

825
01:18:28,660 --> 01:18:32,359
让我看看EatWare应用程序对你有用吗?
Let me does the EatWare application work for you?

826
01:18:33,621 --> 01:18:37,582
我曾经在一个展厅的橱窗里看过LifeFormWare公司的BreakFaster椅子。
I looked at one of those BreakFaster chairs from LifeFormWare in a showroom window once.

827
01:18:37,625 --> 01:18:42,500
它们调整你身体的每个部分，使咀嚼、吞咽和消化变得容易。
The way they adjust every part of your body to make chewing, swallowing and digesting easy.

828
01:18:43,414 --> 01:18:46,896
在我生命中的某个时刻，我以为这可能就是答案。
At one point in my life I thought that might be the answer.

829
01:18:49,681 --> 01:18:51,291
什么问题吗?
To what question?

830
01:18:51,770 --> 01:18:58,037
我的饮食问题，布雷肯的…你确实做到了。
- The eating problem that I have, Brecken had... and that you have.

831
01:18:59,430 --> 01:19:00,953
嗯。
Hm.

832
01:19:00,997 --> 01:19:02,563
你觉得他们有关系?
You think they're related?

833
01:19:02,607 --> 01:19:05,436
-你是一个在与真实的自己抗争的人。
- You're a man who's fighting what he really is.

834
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:07,003
你没有看见吗?
Don't you see?

835
01:19:07,046 --> 01:19:16,186
你应该让你的身体引导你去它想去的地方，而不是把它砍成碎片，像灭绝动物的骨头一样在某个隐藏的博物馆里展示。
You should let your body lead you to where it wants to go instead of hacking it to pieces and displaying it in some hidden museum like the bones of an extinct animal.

836
01:19:16,229 --> 01:19:19,580
-如果Saul听了这个建议，他现在已经死了。
- Saul would be dead now if he listened to that advice.

837
01:19:19,624 --> 01:19:21,800
他的身体想要他的命。
His body wants to kill him.

838
01:19:21,844 --> 01:19:26,152
我们所做的是在无政府状态下创造艺术。
What we're doing is we're making art out of anarchy.

839
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:29,112
我们在空虚中创造意义。
We are creating meaning out of emptiness.

840
01:19:29,852 --> 01:19:31,418
是吗?
Are you?

841
01:19:32,245 --> 01:19:38,774
你有没有想过，你可能只是在干扰一个你应该屈服的奇妙的自然过程?
Has it ever occurred to you that you might simply be interfering in a fantastic natural process that you should surrender to?

842
01:19:41,167 --> 01:19:42,734
从来没有。
Never has.

843
01:19:46,390 --> 01:19:50,133
你会参加布雷肯的节目吗?
Will you do the Brecken show?

844
01:19:52,875 --> 01:19:54,790
-我应该做布雷肯的节目吗?
- Should I do the Brecken show?

845
01:19:56,356 --> 01:19:59,098
新Vice想从中得到什么?
What does New Vice want to get out of this?

846
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,710
-你有了新闺蜜
- You have a new best friend.

847
01:20:04,538 --> 01:20:06,062
-那是谁?
- Who would that be?

848
01:20:06,105 --> 01:20:07,672
朗Dotrice。
Lang Dotrice.

849
01:20:08,368 --> 01:20:09,892
我们想要他。
We want him.

850
01:20:10,457 --> 01:20:12,503
但我们要的不仅仅是他。
But we don't just want him.

851
01:20:13,896 --> 01:20:15,854
我们想要他那群怪胎。
We want his group of freaks.

852
01:20:15,898 --> 01:20:17,464
他们所有人。
All of them.

853
01:20:17,508 --> 01:20:19,727
-我不知道什么组织。
- I don't know anything about a group.

854
01:20:20,859 --> 01:20:23,035
-你会了解这个团体的。

855
01:20:23,731 --> 01:20:25,429
他喜欢你。
He likes you.

856
01:20:25,472 --> 01:20:26,996
他信任你。
He trusts you.

857
01:20:27,735 --> 01:20:30,782
-他信任我在公共场合肢解他死去的儿子。
- He trusts me to cut up his dead son in public.

858
01:20:31,609 --> 01:20:33,132
我们会得到什么?
What'll that get us?

859
01:20:33,176 --> 01:20:36,788
-它可以让你进入下一个阶段，即渗透。
- It could get you to the next stage, which is infiltration.

860
01:20:37,833 --> 01:20:41,837
我们要知道关于多特丽丝和他那些吃塑料的战友们的一切。
We want to know everything there is to know about Dotrice and his plastic-eating comrades.

861
01:20:43,447 --> 01:20:44,970
——Plastic-eating ?
- Plastic-eating?

862
01:20:46,798 --> 01:20:48,452
-你还不明白?
- You don't get it yet?

863
01:20:50,976 --> 01:20:54,110
-你说的是那些紫色的糖果?
- You talking about those purple candy bars?

864
01:20:56,764 --> 01:20:58,679
-吃过吗?
- Ever try eating one of those?

865
01:20:59,855 --> 01:21:01,378
我们的一个探员做到了。
One of our agents did.

866
01:21:01,813 --> 01:21:03,467
他现在和布雷肯一样死了。
He's as dead as Brecken now.

867
01:21:04,816 --> 01:21:06,339
毒害了他吗?
Poisoned him?

868
01:21:06,383 --> 01:21:08,167
他们synth酒吧。
They're synth bars.

869
01:21:08,211 --> 01:21:10,300
合成的,人造的东西。
Synthetic, man-made stuff.

870
01:21:10,953 --> 01:21:12,389
有毒的。
Toxic.

871
01:21:12,432 --> 01:21:14,347
正常人不能吃那种东西。
A normal human can't eat that stuff.

872
01:21:15,740 --> 01:21:23,139
但那些人-他们只是…它们只是不停地咀嚼，没有问题。
But those people, - they just... they just munch away, no problem.

873
01:21:29,275 --> 01:21:31,756
他们正在远离人类的道路，索尔。
They're evolving away from the human path, Saul.

874
01:21:33,714 --> 01:21:35,542
不能让这种情况继续下去。
It can't be allowed to continue.

875
01:22:17,106 --> 01:22:18,672
医生Nasatir吗?
Doctor Nasatir?

876
01:22:18,716 --> 01:22:20,152
是吗?
Yes?

877
01:22:20,196 --> 01:22:21,893
-路由器和Berst的LifeFormWare。
- Router and Berst of LifeFormWare.

878
01:22:22,285 --> 01:22:23,851
授权的技术人员。
Authorized technicians.

879
01:22:25,636 --> 01:22:28,769
你打电话给我们，我们来了。
You called us, we're here.

880
01:22:29,901 --> 01:22:31,424
我给你打电话了吗?
Did I call you?

881
01:22:31,468 --> 01:22:33,687
-改变你的早餐椅模式。
- A paradigm shift with your BreakFaster chair.

882
01:22:35,037 --> 01:22:37,474
-没错，但我现在正在吃饭。
- Yes, that's true, but I'm just eating now.

883
01:22:38,475 --> 01:22:41,608
哦，来得正是时候。
Oh, it's perfect timing.

884
01:23:22,084 --> 01:23:23,607
-我们要把所有东西都搬走。
- We're moving everything out.

885
01:23:23,650 --> 01:23:25,870
这位塔尔先生，他负责一切。
Mr. Tarr here, he's taking care of everything.

886
01:23:26,436 --> 01:23:31,310
我觉得布雷肯的节目会让我们变得很性感，但这个，
I figure the Brecken show is going to make us too hot but this,

887
01:23:33,573 --> 01:23:35,488
我们都吃这个。
this is what all of us eat.

888
01:23:38,056 --> 01:23:40,319
-我们所有人，是多少?
- All of us, is how many?

889
01:23:40,363 --> 01:23:45,020
-嗯，我们自己的小细胞，有六七十个人，但在世界各地，我们的网络是巨大的。
- Well, our own little cell, 60, 70 souls but around the world, our network is vast.

890
01:23:45,063 --> 01:23:46,586
实际上，这个数字是不可知的。
And, really, the number's unknowable.

891
01:23:47,631 --> 01:23:50,503
-每个人都做过同样复杂的手术吗?
- And everybody's had the same elaborate surgery?

892
01:23:51,417 --> 01:23:53,158
塔尔。
Tarr.

893
01:23:53,550 --> 01:23:55,813
世界上的每个人，是的。
Everyone around the world, yes.

894
01:23:55,856 --> 01:23:58,598
这些程序是多年合作开发出来的。
The procedures were developed over years of collaboration.

895
01:23:59,164 --> 01:24:00,731
当然，也有不同的情况。
There are variations, of course.

896
01:24:00,774 --> 01:24:02,298
文化独特的版本。
Culturally unique versions.

897
01:24:02,341 --> 01:24:04,387
-你这么做是因为?
- And you did it because?

898
01:24:04,430 --> 01:24:08,086
-因为我们的身体告诉我们是时候改变了，是吗?
- Because our bodies were telling us it was time to change, yes?

899
01:24:08,608 --> 01:24:12,090
是时候让人类进化与人类科技同步了。
Time for human evolution to sync up with human technology.

900
01:24:13,135 --> 01:24:15,876
我们必须开始以我们自己的工业废料为食。
We've got to start feeding on our own industrial waste.

901
01:24:15,920 --> 01:24:17,443
这是我们的命运。
It's our destiny.

902
01:24:17,487 --> 01:24:19,706
-最终的结果是你不能吃食物。
- The end result is you can't eat food.

903
01:24:19,750 --> 01:24:21,404
-我们吃的是现代食物。
- Well, we eat modern food.

904
01:24:21,752 --> 01:24:23,275
我们吃塑料。
We eat plastic.

905
01:24:23,319 --> 01:24:25,190
我们喜欢这样称呼它。
And that's what we like to call it.

906
01:24:25,234 --> 01:24:26,844
和Brecken吗?
And Brecken?

907
01:24:28,237 --> 01:24:29,803
Brecken。
Brecken.

908
01:24:31,675 --> 01:24:33,242
布雷肯是长子。
Brecken was the first-born.

909
01:24:37,072 --> 01:24:41,337
-第一个生来就有塑料的…处理消化系统。
- The first to be born with a plastic... processing digestive system.

910
01:24:43,382 --> 01:24:46,864
…自然不自然。
To be... naturally unnatural.

911
01:24:47,691 --> 01:24:49,823
-她恨我们。Djuna恨我们。
- She hated us. Djuna hated us.

912
01:24:50,955 --> 01:24:52,609
她从我们身边偷走了布雷肯。
She stole Brecken away from us.

913
01:24:53,784 --> 01:24:57,222
她从来没有真正明白她的孩子是一个多么宝贵的人。
She never really understood what a gem her kid was.

914
01:24:57,266 --> 01:24:58,832
她，她无法接受。
She-- she couldn't handle it.

915
01:24:58,876 --> 01:25:03,141
-他一定是个了不起的人，因为你说的话听起来很疯狂。
- He really must have been a gem, because what you're saying sounds insane to me.

916
01:25:03,185 --> 01:25:04,708
为什么?
Why?

917
01:25:05,578 --> 01:25:10,931
-你是说你的手术，那个让你吃塑料的手术，
- Well, you're saying your surgery, the surgery that made you plastic eaters,

918
01:25:13,891 --> 01:25:16,154
从基因上复制到你儿子身上了吗?
was somehow replicated genetically in your son?

919
01:25:16,720 --> 01:25:22,508
通过手术获得的特征是可以遗传的?
That surgically acquired characteristics became inheritable?

920
01:25:27,165 --> 01:25:32,562
你切掉了自己的小手指，而你的孩子生来就没有小手指?
You cut off your little finger and your kids are born without little fingers?

921
01:25:34,955 --> 01:25:36,609
-布雷肯是我们的奇迹孩子。
- Brecken was our miracle child.

922
01:25:37,306 --> 01:25:39,525
他是我们梦寐以求的那种人。
He was everything we all wanted to be.

923
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:41,179
这就是我能说的。
That's all I can say.

924
01:25:41,223 --> 01:25:43,050
我不能说我理解这个过程。
Can't say I understand the process.

925
01:25:43,094 --> 01:25:45,618
-但为什么是布雷肯的节目?
- But why a Brecken show?

926
01:25:45,662 --> 01:25:48,708
-因为我想有一天，向全世界展示我的儿子。
- Because I wanted to, someday, present my son to the world.

927
01:25:48,752 --> 01:25:53,409
我想向世界展示人类的未来是存在的，是美好的。
I wanted to show the world that the future of humanity existed and was good.

928
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:57,195
与我们所创造的科技世界保持着和平与和谐。
Was at peace and harmony with the techno world that we've created.

929
01:25:57,239 --> 01:26:02,983
现在，我所能做的就是把他那小小的尸体呈现出来作为对未来的承诺。
Now, all I can do is present the reality of his dead little body as a promise of that future.

930
01:26:04,202 --> 01:26:05,856
我不知道我们会看到什么。
I don't know what we'll see.

931
01:26:06,857 --> 01:26:08,511
但我知道他会很漂亮。
But I know he'll be beautiful.

932
01:26:09,642 --> 01:26:14,256
甜美、真实、美丽。
Sweet and real and beautiful.

933
01:26:20,914 --> 01:26:22,699
对不起,我要……
Sorry, I gotta...

934
01:26:26,877 --> 01:26:28,792
我没想到你会在这里。
I didn't expect you to be here.

935
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:31,925
——嗯。-就是躲不开，是吧?
- Hm. - Couldn't keep away, huh?

936
01:26:33,797 --> 01:26:35,320
猜不是。
Guess not.

937
01:26:35,973 --> 01:26:37,496
特殊的事件。
Special event.

938
01:26:37,540 --> 01:26:39,194
-嗯嗯。
- Mm-hm.

939
01:26:39,542 --> 01:26:41,108
值得冒这个风险。
Worth the risk.

940
01:27:03,087 --> 01:27:05,829
-我们都想看尸检，不是吗?
- We've all wanted to see an autopsy, haven't we?

941
01:27:07,918 --> 01:27:19,190
我们都觉得身体是空的，没有意义，我们想确认这一点，这样我们就能让它充满意义。
We've all felt that the body was empty, empty of meaning and we've wanted to confirm that, so that we could fill it with meaning.

942
01:27:22,585 --> 01:27:25,718
Autopsia是指亲眼看到。
Autopsia means the seeing for oneself.

943
01:27:27,024 --> 01:27:28,547
为什么第一次尸检吗?
Why First Autopsy?

944
01:27:29,809 --> 01:27:33,248
因为我们知道还会有第二次尸检。
Because we know there'll have to be a Second Autopsy.

945
01:27:35,337 --> 01:27:40,255
如果你想做尸检，你需要一具尸体。
If you want to do an autopsy, you need a corpse.

946
01:27:40,864 --> 01:27:46,913
肉体的结合,肥胖的。
Corporeal, incorporate, corpulent.

947
01:27:47,523 --> 01:27:49,089
身体语言。
Body words.

948
01:27:49,699 --> 01:27:51,266
的单词。
Fleshy words.

949
01:27:54,530 --> 01:27:56,096
布雷肯是我们的尸体。
Brecken is our corpse.

950
01:27:59,361 --> 01:28:07,238
布雷肯是一个小男孩，他被他的母亲谋杀，因为他体内隐藏的东西。
Brecken was a young boy who was murdered by his mother because of what was hidden in his body.

951
01:28:09,719 --> 01:28:12,199
因为那是有意义的。
Because of the meaning that was there.

952
01:28:14,985 --> 01:28:17,466
对她来说，身体并非毫无意义。
For her, the body was not empty of meaning.

953
01:28:30,479 --> 01:28:49,933
现在让我们深入布雷肯的身体，像文学教授一样，寻找隐藏在布雷肯这首诗中的意义。
And now let us dive deep into the body of Brecken and, like professors of literature, search for the meaning that lies locked in the poem that was Brecken.

954
01:29:02,293 --> 01:29:03,816
哦,我的上帝。
Oh, my God.

955
01:29:27,449 --> 01:29:29,015
哦。
Oh.

956
01:29:39,635 --> 01:29:51,516
所以，我们看到这个世界的粗俗、绝望和丑陋已经渗透到我们最年轻、最美丽的内心。
So, we see that the crudeness and the desperation and the ugliness of the world has seeped inside even our youngest and most beautiful.

957
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:58,044
我们看到这个世界正在从内到外杀死我们的孩子。
And we see that the world is killing our children from the inside out.

958
01:30:00,133 --> 01:30:03,093
这是今天的病理解剖。
Here we have the anatomy of today's pathology.

959
01:30:04,442 --> 01:30:09,142
现在我们知道为什么要进行第二次和第三次尸检了。
And we know now why we'll have a Second Autopsy, and a Third.

960
01:30:10,753 --> 01:30:19,762
我们知道我们必须保持…回到内心深处，希望能找到不同的答案。
We know that we'll have to keep... diving back deep inside, hoping to find a different answer.

961
01:30:22,678 --> 01:30:28,161
但今晚，让我们不要害怕描绘出内心的混乱。
But for tonight, let us not be afraid to map the chaos inside.

962
01:30:31,513 --> 01:30:38,433
让我们创造一张地图指引我们进入黑暗的中心。
Let us create a map that will guide us into the heart of darkness.

963
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:11,553
不,不,不。
No, no, no.

964
01:31:15,252 --> 01:31:16,906
不，不，不，不。
No, no, no, no, no, no.

965
01:31:22,215 --> 01:31:23,739
-太可怕了。
- That was hideous.

966
01:31:23,782 --> 01:31:25,349
-我感觉糟透了。
- I feel so awful.

967
01:31:25,392 --> 01:31:28,134
-他在里面不是那样的，他不是那样的。
- That's not what he was inside, that's not what he was.

968
01:31:28,178 --> 01:31:29,701
她这样做。
She did this.

969
01:31:29,745 --> 01:31:32,225
——她?-她她她
- She? - She, she, she.

970
01:31:32,269 --> 01:31:34,489
——前妻;尸体的母亲。
- The ex-wife; the mother of the cadaver.

971
01:31:38,318 --> 01:31:39,842
Djuna吗?
Djuna?

972
01:31:40,233 --> 01:31:41,757
不,她没有。
No, she didn't.

973
01:31:41,800 --> 01:31:43,715
她跟这事一点关系都没有。
She had nothing to do with it.

974
01:31:43,759 --> 01:31:45,325
-她当然说了
- Of course she did.

975
01:31:45,369 --> 01:31:49,329
你在里面看到的，是她给我的信息，给我的。
What you saw in there, that was her message to me, to me.

976
01:31:49,373 --> 01:31:51,201
-不，不是。
- No, it wasn't.

977
01:31:53,290 --> 01:31:55,727
不过我觉得她会同意的。
I have a feeling she'd approve of this, though.

978
01:32:52,088 --> 01:32:53,611
-抱歉我迟到了。
- I'm sorry I'm late.

979
01:32:54,264 --> 01:32:55,787
最近有很多会议。
Lots of meetings these days.

980
01:32:56,527 --> 01:33:01,532
嗯……新Vice越来越大了，是吧?
Hm... New Vice is getting quite big, is it?

981
01:33:01,967 --> 01:33:03,534
这是现在。
It is now.

982
01:33:03,578 --> 01:33:05,231
很多人都被吓到了。
A lot of people running scared.

983
01:33:05,884 --> 01:33:08,800
这么多吃塑料的人拿着手术刀到处跑。
So many plastic-eaters running around with scalpels.

984
01:33:09,366 --> 01:33:10,889
让人没有安全感。
Makes people insecure.

985
01:33:11,629 --> 01:33:15,372
-那些吃塑料的人很会用手术刀。
- They're pretty good with the scalpels, those plastic-eaters.

986
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:20,072
比那个黑布雷肯的人强多了。
Better than whoever did that hack job on Brecken's insides.

987
01:33:23,467 --> 01:33:29,473
——是的,所以…好吧……好了，里面有个人。
- Yeah, so... Okay... Okay, we've got a man inside.

988
01:33:29,995 --> 01:33:31,562
我们先到的。
We got there first.

989
01:33:32,084 --> 01:33:34,913
那孩子的内心很奇怪。
The kid was pretty weird inside anyway.

990
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:42,051
你可能什么都认不出来，但最糟糕的是……这一切都是自然的。
You wouldn't have recognized a thing, but the hell of it was that... it was all natural.

991
01:33:42,094 --> 01:33:43,618
他生来如此。
He was born that way.

992
01:33:50,189 --> 01:33:52,409
-你不会想让所有人都知道的。
- You wouldn't want everybody to know that.

993
01:33:53,497 --> 01:33:55,020
我不能。
I couldn't.

994
01:33:55,064 --> 01:33:56,543
我不能泄露出去。
I couldn't let that out.

995
01:33:56,587 --> 01:34:01,287
一旦它从盒子里拿出来，你就再也放不回去了。
Once that got out of the box, you would never be able to put it back in.

996
01:34:03,246 --> 01:34:05,814
是你在登记处的朋友干的。
Your friend at the Registry did the work.

997
01:34:05,857 --> 01:34:07,467
“灵感来自任性。”
"Inspired by Caprice."

998
01:34:07,511 --> 01:34:08,773
我的朋友吗?
My friend?

999
01:34:08,817 --> 01:34:10,253
你的意思是,Wippet ?
You mean, Wippet?

1000
01:34:10,296 --> 01:34:12,647
-不，那个奇怪的小女人
- No, that strange little woman.

1001
01:34:12,690 --> 01:34:14,910
-她叫什么名字?
- What's her name?

1002
01:34:14,953 --> 01:34:16,520
嗯,Timlin。
Uh, Timlin.

1003
01:34:19,654 --> 01:34:22,091
-我想知道她来表演做什么。
- I wondered what she was doing at the show.

1004
01:34:23,092 --> 01:34:25,572
我猜她是忍不住要看看她的作品。
I guess she couldn't resist checking out her work.

1005
01:34:26,008 --> 01:34:30,012
-她真的很想为你做Caprice，如果你明白我的意思。
- She really wants to be Caprice for you, if you know what I mean.

1006
01:34:30,055 --> 01:34:31,883
我知道你知道。
And I know that you do.

1007
01:34:33,406 --> 01:34:34,930
-那Dotrice的暗杀呢?
- And Dotrice's assassination?

1008
01:34:34,973 --> 01:34:36,540
暗杀?
Assassination?

1009
01:34:38,716 --> 01:34:40,239
谋杀的华丽词儿。
Fancy word for murder.

1010
01:34:40,718 --> 01:34:42,415
-他是个领袖。
- He was a leader.

1011
01:34:42,459 --> 01:34:43,982
他是有原因的。
He had a cause.

1012
01:34:46,289 --> 01:34:49,031
-不管是什么，对我来说也是个惊喜。
- Whatever it was, it was a surprise to me too.

1013
01:34:49,074 --> 01:34:52,382
-你有个不告诉我事情的坏习惯。
- You have a bad habit of not telling me things.

1014
01:34:52,991 --> 01:34:54,689
这使得它很难发挥作用。
It makes it difficult to function.

1015
01:34:55,080 --> 01:34:57,561
-我告诉你，我们不知道。
- I'm telling you, we didn't know about it.

1016
01:35:00,999 --> 01:35:06,265
也许……也许是他的疯老婆影响了他。
Maybe... Maybe his crazy wife got to him somehow.

1017
01:35:06,309 --> 01:35:07,832
我不知道。
I don't know.

1018
01:35:08,441 --> 01:35:10,008
不,不,不。
No, no, no.

1019
01:35:11,923 --> 01:35:13,838
谁杀了他并不重要。
Well, it doesn't matter who killed him.

1020
01:35:16,275 --> 01:35:18,190
这会让他成为殉道者。
It's going to make him a martyr.

1021
01:35:20,062 --> 01:35:21,628
正是这个事业所需要的。
Just what the cause needs.

1022
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:26,677
的原因吗?
The cause?

1023
01:35:28,331 --> 01:35:30,594
听起来你正在成为一个信徒。
Sounds like you are becoming a believer.

1024
01:35:33,292 --> 01:35:39,124
-如果你想要擅长卧底生活，你必须有一部分信仰。
- If you're going to be good at living undercover, a part of you has to believe.

1025
01:35:46,088 --> 01:35:47,611
扫罗!
Saul!

1026
01:35:49,091 --> 01:35:50,657
扫罗!
Saul!

1027
01:36:02,887 --> 01:36:04,454
哦……
Oh...

1028
01:36:06,543 --> 01:36:08,066
哦!
Uh!

1029
01:36:16,553 --> 01:36:18,076
嗯,嗯。
Uh, uh-uh.

1030
01:36:33,222 --> 01:36:34,789
-你很痛苦。
- You are in pain.

1031
01:36:42,666 --> 01:36:44,189
嗯…
Uh...

1032
01:36:48,585 --> 01:36:50,108
是我吗?
Was I?

1033
01:36:51,240 --> 01:36:52,807
是什么样的?
What's it like?

1034
01:36:56,071 --> 01:36:57,637
身体疼痛吗?
Physical pain?

1035
01:36:58,203 --> 01:36:59,770
是的。
Yes.

1036
01:37:02,860 --> 01:37:04,949
-这很难弄清楚。
- It's hard to be clear about it.

1037
01:37:05,428 --> 01:37:09,954
它变成了……梦想的一部分。
It becomes... part of the dreaming.

1038
01:37:10,999 --> 01:37:17,135
夹杂着做梦时的情感痛苦，所以…
mixes with the emotional pain of the dreaming, so it's-it's...

1039
01:37:19,529 --> 01:37:21,052
这是困惑。
It's confused.

1040
01:37:22,271 --> 01:37:32,194
我…我几乎以为……我差点以为我…我是感觉。
I... I almost thought... I almost thought I was... I was feeling.

1041
01:37:33,630 --> 01:37:35,153
啊。
Ah.

1042
01:37:35,937 --> 01:37:37,460
啊…
Ahh...

1043
01:37:39,941 --> 01:37:41,638
-你梦到Dotrice了吗?
- Did you dream about Dotrice?

1044
01:37:51,604 --> 01:37:55,870
Dotrice……Djuna Brecken。
Dotrice... Djuna and Brecken.

1045
01:38:00,439 --> 01:38:03,965
他们都在萨克号上。
They were all in the Sark together.

1046
01:38:05,618 --> 01:38:07,142
一个家庭解剖。
A family autopsy.

1047
01:38:13,235 --> 01:38:14,889
-是谁控制的?
- Who was at the controls?

1048
01:38:15,846 --> 01:38:17,369
你。
You.

1049
01:38:20,851 --> 01:38:22,374
和我。
And I.

1050
01:38:23,810 --> 01:38:25,334
我们都是。
We both were.

1051
01:39:41,888 --> 01:39:45,849
扫罗…你觉得呢?
Well, Saul... what do you think?

1052
01:39:48,286 --> 01:39:50,332
——是的。我想是的。
- Yes. I think yes.

1053
01:39:53,857 --> 01:39:55,380
是时候试试了。
It's time to try it.
