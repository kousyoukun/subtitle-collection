Hi.

118
00:09:38,077 --> 00:09:42,873
Welcome to, uh, whatever this is.

119
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:45,835
Um, I've been working
for the last couple months,

120
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:50,798
um, testing this camera,
and testing lights, and writing,

121
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:56,095
and I've decided to, uh,
try to make a new special.

122
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,263
For real.

123
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:00,057
Um, it's not gonna be a normal special

124
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,768
because there's no audience,
and there's no crew.

125
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,563
It's just me and my camera,

126
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:07,607
and you and your screen.

127
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,319
Uh, the way that… that our Lord intended.

128
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,362
Um…

129
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:17,658
And the whole special
will be… will be filmed in this, uh, room.

130
00:10:18,993 --> 00:10:20,661
And instead of being filmed

131
00:10:21,162 --> 00:10:24,999
in a single night, it will be filmed in

132
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:27,293
uh, however long it takes to finish.

133
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,339
I hope you, uh, enjoy it.

134
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,259
I… I hope this special
can maybe do for you

135
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:37,678
what it's done for me
these last couple months,

136
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:42,808
which is, uh, to distract me from wanting

137
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,603
to put a bullet into my head with a gun.

138
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,772

Look who stopped by to say hello.

202
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:13,662
It's Socko.

203
00:15:14,204 --> 00:15:15,748
Hey!

204
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,666
Where you been, Socko?

205
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,004
I've been where I always am
when you're not wearing me on your hand.

206
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:26,258
In a frightening,
liminal space between states of being.

207
00:15:26,342 --> 00:15:28,761
Not quite dead, not quite alive.

208
00:15:28,844 --> 00:15:32,640
It's similar to a constant state
of sleep paralysis.

209
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:36,268
Socko, we were just talking
about the world and how it works.

210
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,771
Boy, that sounds complicated.

211
00:15:38,854 --> 00:15:41,690
Do you have anything you'd want
to teach us about the world?

212
00:15:41,774 --> 00:15:45,444
I wouldn't say anything that you probably
haven't already said yourself.

213
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,446
I don't know about that, Socko.

214
00:15:47,529 --> 00:15:48,948
How about you give it a try?

00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,533

Read a book or something. I don't know.

238
00:16:55,889 --> 00:16:59,643
Just don't burden me
with the responsibility of educating you.

239
00:16:59,727 --> 00:17:01,478
It's incredibly exhausting.

240
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:02,688
I'm sorry, Socko.

241
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,524
I was just trying
to become a better person.

242
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:07,943
Why do you rich fucking white people

243
00:17:08,027 --> 00:17:11,196
insist on seeing
every socio-political conflict

244
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:15,075
through the myopic lens
of your own self-actualization?

245
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,952
This isn't about you.

246
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,205
So either get with it,
or get out of the fucking way.

247
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,293
Watch your mouth, buddy.
Remember who's on whose hand here.

248
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:27,171
But that's what I--
Have you not been fucking listening?

249
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,797
-We are entrenched in--
-All right.

250
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,883
Wait! No, please!
I don't want to go back.

251
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:34,219

Hello, my name is Bo Burnham.

268
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:30,067
And I am a former comedian,

269
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:33,904
turned social brand consultant.

270
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,202
It's a very exciting time to be a,
uh, brand.

271
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:45,582
It's also a bit of a scary time
because customers expect a lot more

272
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,043
from their brands
than they did in the past.

273
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:50,838
During this incredibly necessary

274
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:54,299
and overdue social reckoning
that we're having in our culture,

275
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:59,346
it is no longer acceptable for brands
to stay out of the conversation.

276
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:03,142
Consumers want to know, "Are you willing
to use your brand awareness

277
00:19:03,225 --> 00:19:05,477
to effect positive social change?"

278
00:19:06,228 --> 00:19:08,438
Which will create more brand awareness.

279
00:19:08,522 --> 00:19:13,944
The question I ask the brands I work with
is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is, is…

280
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,196
"Are you gonna be
on the right side of history?"

281
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:18,657
The question isn't,
"What are you selling?"

282
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:21,493
Or… or "What service are you providing?"

283
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:24,580
The question is, "What do you stand for?"

284
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,876
Who are you, Bagel Bites?

285
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,044
All these big companies, they're so scared

286
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:34,590
of all this social change, and I come in
and I put their fears to rest.

287
00:19:34,673 --> 00:19:36,758
You know, I tell them, "Just be honest."

288
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:41,138
"Tell your customers
that… that JPMorgan is against racism."

289
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:42,222
In theory.

290
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:43,891
The question is no longer,

291
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:48,395
"Do you want to buy Wheat Thins?"
For example.

292
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,063
The question is now,

293
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:55,777
"Will you support Wheat Thins
in the fight against Lyme disease?"

294
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:58,238
There's no sugarcoating it. The world is…

295
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,283
fucked up.

296
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:07,247
And you've got a choice as a brand.
You can…

297
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,502
hide and bury your head in the sand
and hope it fixes itself,

298
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:17,299
or you can roll up your sleeves
and get to work,

299
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:21,011
and sell Butterfingers.

Here's a question for you guys. Um…

372
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,958
Is it… is it necessary?

373
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:07,339
Is it necessary
that every single person on this planet

374
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:13,428
um, expresses every single opinion
that they have

375
00:25:13,512 --> 00:25:16,556
on every single thing that occurs

376
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:18,683
all at the same time?

377
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:22,020
Is that… is that necessary?

378
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:23,730
Um…

379
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,358
Or to ask in a slightly different way,

380
00:25:26,441 --> 00:25:29,569
um, can… can anyone

381
00:25:31,238 --> 00:25:32,322

382
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,116

383
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,285

00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,539

Um, I thought I'd do a reaction video

409
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:50,859
Thought that might be fun.

I like this song.

413
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:06,207
Um, so the idea with this song
was basically that there's so many songs

414
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,501
in the past about…
about working-class jobs,

415
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:12,380
but not a lot about the labor exploitation
of the modern world,

416
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,798
so that was the idea here.

I think it's funny to cut right on--

…do a reaction video
to the song that you just saw me perform.

-Thought that might be fun.
-What…

426
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,448
Um, so I got my…

427
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,742
Because this video played after that.

428
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:43,370
Right. So, and now… Right.

429
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,996
Okay, so I'll just keep reacting.

430
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:48,667
So, this is me reacting to the song.

431
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:50,752
Um…

432
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,505
What I'm doing is I'm explaining
what the song means.

433
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:56,466
Um, and what it's about.
I'm being a little pretentious.

434
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:00,011
It's, uh… it's an instinct I have
where I need everything that I write

435
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:02,180
to have some deeper meaning or something.

436
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,684
But it's a stupid song,
and, uh, it doesn't really mean anything,

437
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:09,145
and, uh, it's… it's pretty unlikable
that I… that I feel this need,

438
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:13,441
this desperate need,
to be seen as intelligent.

439
00:28:13,525 --> 00:28:16,069
And the video's ending here,
as you can see,

440
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:19,531
and look, I'm very confused.
See, I'm very, very confused.

441
00:28:19,614 --> 00:28:22,117
'Cause I'm staring at myself,
I don't know what I'm looking at,

442
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:26,538
and I'm starting to catch up now,
and realizing what's going on.

443
00:28:26,621 --> 00:28:29,499
And, uh, yeah, now I'm deciding to react

444
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:32,335
to the reaction to the video.

445
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:36,423
So here, um, I'm reacting
to my own reacting,

446
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:41,094
and I'm criticizing my initial reaction
for… for being pretentious,

447
00:28:41,177 --> 00:28:44,556
which is… which is honestly,
it's a… it's a defense mechanism.

448
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:47,767
I'm… I'm so worried
that criticism will be levied against me

449
00:28:47,851 --> 00:28:50,562
that I levy it against myself
before anyone else can.

450
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:53,690
And I think that, "Oh, if I'm self-aware
about being a douchebag,

451
00:28:53,773 --> 00:28:57,110
it'll somehow make me less
of a douchebag." But it… but it doesn't.

452
00:28:57,193 --> 00:28:59,946
Um, self-awareness does not absolve
anybody of anything.

453
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:02,490
Am I balding?
This is really, really disturbing.

454
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:06,536
I don't like looking at myself like this,
and I want… I want this to stop.

455
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:09,330
Okay, I want this to stop.
I'm… I'm stopping this.

456
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,625
So, yeah,
that was, uh, my reaction to the song,

457
00:29:12,709 --> 00:29:14,252

476
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:21,277
that you know, maybe, um, allowing

481
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,461
a bad call

483
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,717

484
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:49,764

subjective human experience

485
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:54,811

I've been working on this special now
for six months.

647
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:18,077
And… the whole time
I've had a… a goal in mind,

648
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:22,039
which is I wanted to finish this thing

649
00:42:23,582 --> 00:42:26,168
before I turned 30.

650
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:31,757
Um, because the idea of… of turning 30,

651
00:42:33,008 --> 00:42:36,053
while still in this fucking room,

652
00:42:37,012 --> 00:42:38,806
working on this thing alone,

653
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:42,142
um, that just seemed…

654
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,897
I just… I just wanted to avoid that.

655
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:47,982
So…

656
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:52,611
And you might be thinking, "Well,
that's fine. You know, look at you."

657

struggling with suicidal thoughts

720

and you want to kill yourself,

721
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,863
I just want to tell you don't.

722
00:47:06,156 --> 00:47:09,159
Okay? Can you not, please?

723
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,246
Just don't. All right?

724
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:14,998
Fucking quit it with the--

725
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,378
But really, don't kill yourself.
You don't want to, because…

726
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:25,259
There are people that love you…

727
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:26,802
That's not true necessarily,

728
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:29,555
but there could be people
that love you in the future,

729
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:30,514
and just don't.

730
00:47:30,597 --> 00:47:32,599
I've had people close to me
kill themselves,

731
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,477
and I'll be honest with you,
didn't love it.

732
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:37,521
Didn't love that.

733
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:38,689
So just don't.

734
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:42,025
But if I could kill myself for a year…

735
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:44,945
If I can-- I'd do it today.

736
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:47,698
If I could kill myself today and be dead

737
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,200
until like 18 months from now,

738
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:54,329
um, I would do it, but alas…

739
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:57,833

you're dead forever,

What's up, boys. Welcome to the stream.

768
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:46,334
Um, I'm gonna be doing
some live play today

769
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,045
for the first time in a while.

770
00:50:48,128 --> 00:50:50,964
Uh, you guys have been wanting that,
so we're gonna do--

771
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,382
This is the title, Inside.

772
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,218
I've got a lot of requests
for this game in chat.

773
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:57,637
It's some indie developer.
I'm not really sure.

774
00:50:57,721 --> 00:50:59,723
I'm going in totally cold on this.

775
00:50:59,806 --> 00:51:03,393
Um, JB, thank you for the three months.
My dude, much appreciated.

776
00:51:04,061 --> 00:51:06,563
Um… Okay.

777
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:12,944
That looks pretty good, graphics-wise.
I mean, I know it's a cinematic, but…

778
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,282
So we're gonna be trying
to do live plays every day this week,

779
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:18,283
so tune in for that.

780
00:51:18,366 --> 00:51:21,203
I would be gifting 30 subs
at the end of the week.

781
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:25,665
Um, day 50, 250… All right,
so this dude's been in here for a while.

782
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:28,168
-So is this like an escape the room?

783
00:51:28,251 --> 00:51:30,003
-Or…

784
00:51:30,087 --> 00:51:31,088
Okay.

785
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,756
So I can cry.

786
00:51:32,839 --> 00:51:36,093
So he's… he's not happy
about being in this room.

787
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,389
I like the music.
The music is actually nice on this.

788
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:47,938
Controls are actually pretty smooth.
So you're in this like 2D set up, right?

789
00:51:48,814 --> 00:51:50,774
Like, I can't control the camera.

790
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,151
Um…

791
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,571
I'll give it-- I guess I'll cry again.

792
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:58,240
-He's--

793
00:51:58,323 --> 00:52:00,784
So is the dude big, or is the room small?

794
00:52:00,867 --> 00:52:02,536
That's what I'm confused about.

795
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,205
Chat's saying, try the door.
Yeah, well, okay.

796
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,792
I mean, I don't think
it's gonna be that simple, but I will.

797
00:52:09,960 --> 00:52:11,128
Yeah, there ya go.

798
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:14,297
Um, okay,
Well, I think he'll probably cry again.

799
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:15,924
-It's tough, dude.

800
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:18,593
-It's tough. He's been in here a while.

801
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,095
Um, see, I don't like that.

802
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:23,682
I don't know why they feel the need
to give the hint so quick.

803
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:26,560
I just wish they'd let me…
let me explore a little bit.

804
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:31,982
Wha… I'm holding the flashlight
like a… like a cop.

805
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,608
-Why is he doing that?

806
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:37,612
Ah.

807
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,199
All right. Okay. So…

808
00:52:44,035 --> 00:52:45,036
All right.

809
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:49,833
Okay, he seems a little happier now.
That's nice.

810
00:52:51,459 --> 00:52:52,669
I don't know.

811
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:54,004
I'll cry, I guess, again.

812
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,135
Okay, I'm not sure
what I'm supposed to be do--

813
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,761
Oh! Nice.

814
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:03,555
Okay, yeah.

815
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,893
Yeah, great. Um…

816
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,645
All right, I'm into this.

817
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,857
Yeah, it's giving me
sort of like Death Stranding vibes,

818
00:53:13,940 --> 00:53:17,444
you know,
'cause it's, like, it's fucking boring,

819
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:19,529
but that's, like, the point, I think.

820

I've been freaking out for a long time,

954
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:12,460
thinking I'm never gonna finish
this special and be working on it forever.

955
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,170
And recently, I've been feeling like,

956
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,090
"Oh, man, maybe I am
getting close to done with this."

957
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:21,761
"Maybe I'm gonna finish it after all."
And that has made me completely freak out

958
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,263
because if I finish this special,

959
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:28,810
that means that I have to,
um, not work on it anymore.

960
01:01:28,893 --> 01:01:31,729
And that means
I have to just live my life,

961
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:35,233
and so I'm not gonna do that,
and I'm gonna not finish the special.

962
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,235
I'm gonna work on it forever, I think.

963
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,737
So, yeah, I'm gonna work on this forever,

964
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,657
and I'm never gonna release it.
I'm not talking to anybody now.

965
01:01:42,740 --> 01:01:43,991
I'm just talking to myself.

966
01:01:44,075 --> 01:01:45,827

over this last year,

988
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,657
which is pretty funny.

989
01:03:06,741 --> 01:03:09,285
Um, I've learned that

990
01:03:10,578 --> 01:03:13,831
real-world human-to-human
tactile contact will kill you,

991
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:17,335
and that all human interaction,

992
01:03:17,418 --> 01:03:21,464
whether it be social, political,
spiritual, sexual, or interpersonal

993
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:25,134
should be contained

994
01:03:25,218 --> 01:03:27,595
interior digital space.

995
01:03:27,678 --> 01:03:29,222
That the outside world,

996
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,890
the non-digital world,

997
01:03:30,973 --> 01:03:36,103
is merely a theatrical space
in which one stages and records content

998
01:03:36,187 --> 01:03:39,774
for the much more real,
much more vital digital space.

999
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,151
One should only engage
with the outside world

1000
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,903

1003
01:03:50,451 --> 01:03:53,955

to take a little bit better care

1004
01:03:54,038 --> 01:03:55,373
of their fuckin' maps?

1005
01:03:56,874 --> 01:03:59,585
You know, when I find a pirate's map,

1006
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:04,298
it's… it's always tea-stained,
and the edges are burnt,

1007
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:07,385
and it's like if you're a pirate,
all right, and you're gonna

1008
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:12,014
make this map and expect me
to carry it around the globe

1009
01:04:12,098 --> 01:04:13,850

So I've been working

01:10:05,993 --> 01:10:08,204

Fucking…

1103
01:10:25,554 --> 01:10:30,100
So I've been working on this special
for, um, a year now,

1104
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:36,190
which is, um, a lot longer

1105
01:10:36,273 --> 01:10:39,485
than I anticipated working on it.

1106
01:10:40,069 --> 01:10:42,738
When I started…

1107
01:10:56,627 --> 01:10:58,337
So I've been working on--

1108
01:11:02,341 --> 01:11:03,467
I fucking…

1109
01:11:04,718 --> 01:11:06,512

1112
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:25,572

1113
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:30,744

You want to hear a funny story?

1163
01:14:19,037 --> 01:14:20,497
So, uh,

1164
01:14:20,581 --> 01:14:22,541
five years ago, I quit

1165
01:14:23,667 --> 01:14:26,545
performing live comedy,

1166
01:14:27,838 --> 01:14:32,551
because I was beginning to have, uh,
severe panic attacks while on stage,

1167
01:14:33,135 --> 01:14:36,096
which is not a great place to have them.

1168
01:14:37,514 --> 01:14:39,141
So, I… I quit.

1169
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:43,896
And I didn't perform for five years,
and I spent that time…

1170
01:14:46,190 --> 01:14:48,567
trying to improve myself mentally.

1171
01:14:49,735 --> 01:14:50,819
And you know what?

1172
01:14:51,862 --> 01:14:52,779
I did!

1173
01:14:53,655 --> 01:14:54,823
I got better.

1174
01:14:55,616 --> 01:14:58,160
I got so much better, in fact,

1175
01:14:59,077 --> 01:15:01,371
that in January of

1176
01:15:03,040 --> 01:15:04,249
2020,

1177
01:15:07,669 --> 01:15:10,130
I thought, "You know what, I should…

1178
01:15:12,132 --> 01:15:13,675
start performing again."

1179
01:15:15,469 --> 01:15:19,264
"I've been hiding from the world,

1180
01:15:19,932 --> 01:15:21,433
and I need to…

1181
01:15:24,228 --> 01:15:25,521
reenter."

1182
01:15:27,814 --> 01:15:28,857

01:15:30,817 --> 01:15:32,486
