I'm being a little pretentious.

that I levy it against myself

it'll somehow make me less

thinking I'm never gonna finish
this special and be working on it forever.

1046
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:14,170
And recently, I've been feeling like,

"Oh, man, maybe I am
getting close to done with this."

1048

"Maybe I'm gonna finish it after all."
And that has made me completely freak out

1049

because if I finish this special,

1050
01:01:24,347 --> 01:01:28,810
that means that I have to,
um, not work on it anymore.

I have to just live my life,

and I'm gonna not finish the special.
