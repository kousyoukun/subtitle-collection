don't we?

308
00:20:22,348 --> 00:20:25,184
- Your dad sells apples, Andy.
- And raspberries.

309
00:20:25,268 --> 00:20:27,854
I bet you can't wait to jump
into Sergeant Popwell's grave.

310
00:20:27,937 --> 00:20:30,106
I'm not jumping into anyone's grave.

311
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:34,735
- You got a moustache.
- I know.

312
00:20:35,403 --> 00:20:38,573
- Why have you got your stab vest on?
- It's a requirement.

313
00:20:38,656 --> 00:20:42,952
In the city maybe.
Nobody's gonna stab you in here, Sergeant.

314
00:20:43,244 --> 00:20:45,246
Not a member of the public anyhow.

315
00:20:47,331 --> 00:20:50,084
- Have you been stabbed, Sergeant Fisher?
- No.

316
00:20:50,168 --> 00:20:51,586
Well, I have.

317
00:20:51,669 --> 00:20:54,255
And I can assure you
it is not in the least bit amusing.

318
00:20:55,923 --> 00:20:58,468
Have you seen a lot of action,
Sergeant Angel?

319
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:00,470
I've experienced my fair share, yes.

320
00:21:00,553 --> 00:21:03,055
- Did you cook any fools?
- Excuse me?

321
00:21:03,139 --> 00:21:04,390
Did you shoot anybody?

322
00:21:04,474 --> 00:21:07,810
He shot a crack head with a Kalashnikov.

323
00:21:08,352 --> 00:21:12,106
- Where did you get that?
- The offender had the Kalashnikov.

324
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:13,274
Where'd he get that?

325

in the country than there are in the city?

326

is packing round here.

330
00:21:32,794 --> 00:21:36,130
It was the single most painful
experience of my life.

331
00:21:36,214 --> 00:21:38,591

- Yes, I have.

- Simon Skinner, I believe you've met.
- Oh, we're already firm friends.

Oh, please, please, come with me, will you?

Perhaps you might like to join us
for a shoot one day.

357
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,664
Well, I haven't held a firearm
for over two years, Mr Reaper.

358
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:53,374
I'd quite like to keep it that way.

359
00:22:53,458 --> 00:22:55,209

I want to ask you,
would you read a homily at Sunday Service?

363
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:06,220
That might be
a little hypocritical of me, Reverend.

Oh, you're an atheist?

No, I'm... I'm...

366
00:23:10,183 --> 00:23:13,227
I'm open to the concept of religion,
I'm just not entirely convinced by it.

367
00:23:13,311 --> 00:23:15,938

Hopefully we won't see too much
of each other over the coming months.

370
00:23:25,114 --> 00:23:27,074
Well, all that remains is to welcome you

371
00:23:27,158 --> 00:23:31,746
to the weekly meeting
of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance.

Now, quick announcement before we begin.

373

Janet Barker has just given birth to twins.

374

So, congratulations to her.

375

- Tom?
- Thanks, Joyce.

376
00:23:46,302 --> 00:23:47,386
Now.

I am sure that all of you will have noticed
the return of a blight to our streets.

378

It's made all the more disturbing as
the Village of the Year contest looms.

that's the last we'll see of him.

614
00:38:47,537 --> 00:38:48,621
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

615
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:50,039
Who is it?

616
00:38:54,627 --> 00:38:55,753
We haven't got long.

617
00:38:57,713 --> 00:38:58,923
To us.

618
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:01,050
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

619
00:39:01,134 --> 00:39:02,385
Who is it?

620
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:09,851
(BEEPING)

621
00:39:14,272 --> 00:39:15,606
Yeah?

622
00:39:18,484 --> 00:39:20,319
<i>...decaffeinated?
- Decaffeinated?</i>

623
00:39:24,907 --> 00:39:27,994
Little Brian Libby found them,
out on his paper round.

624
00:39:28,786 --> 00:39:31,622
Oh, he'll be having nightmares for a while.

625
00:39:32,081 --> 00:39:36,002
Must have hit the sign at some speed.
Took the whole top off.

626
00:39:36,085 --> 00:39:39,130
- I've had my top off in this lay-by.
- Tits.

627
00:39:39,213 --> 00:39:45,761
Most likely lost control,
left the road there and then ended up here.

628
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:51,767
So, what do we reckon?

629
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:54,020
Sergeant Angel?

630
00:39:54,604 --> 00:39:57,440
Well, we should get a proper cordon off,
screen the remains from public view.

631
00:39:57,523 --> 00:39:59,233
Close down the road
until the ambulance crew arrives,

632
00:39:59,317 --> 00:40:02,653
whereupon we should open
a single lane of traffic and ease congestion.

633
00:40:03,196 --> 00:40:04,530
Very good.

634
00:40:05,198 --> 00:40:06,282
What he said.

635
00:40:11,662 --> 00:40:13,790
- What happened, Danny?
- Car accident.

636
00:40:13,873 --> 00:40:15,625
Nasty way to go.

637
00:40:16,459 --> 00:40:18,461
Constable, official vocab guidelines state

638
00:40:18,544 --> 00:40:21,631
we no longer refer to these incidents
as "accidents," they're now "collisions."

639
00:40:21,714 --> 00:40:22,799
Right.

640
00:40:22,882 --> 00:40:29,013
"For never was there a story of more woe.
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

641
00:40:29,305 --> 00:40:32,975
- Excuse me?
- Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

642
00:40:33,059 --> 00:40:34,644
Mr Skinner, do you mind telling me

643
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:36,938
how you know the identity
of the persons involved?

644
00:40:37,021 --> 00:40:40,483
You know how it is. News travels fast.

645
00:40:40,691 --> 00:40:44,821
<i>A love struck Romeo
sings a streetsus serenade</i>

646
00:40:45,446 --> 00:40:47,824
- What happened, Danny?
- Traffic collision.

647
00:40:49,075 --> 00:40:50,993
Hey, why can't we say "accident" again?

648
00:40:51,077 --> 00:40:53,538
Because "accident" implies
there's nobody to blame.

649
00:40:55,039 --> 00:40:56,457
Put a sock in it, town mouse.

650
00:40:56,541 --> 00:41:00,294
Yeah, you wanna be a big cop in
a small town, fuck off up the model village.

651
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:02,797
I'm just saying,
things aren't always as simple as they look.

652
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,715
Most times they are.

653
00:41:04,799 --> 00:41:07,552
Let's just wait till Doctor Hatcher
comes back with something,

654
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:10,221
before you go jumping the Kalashnikov.

655
00:41:10,304 --> 00:41:13,432
All right, in the meantime, why don't you
check out a few of Martin Blower's clients?

656
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:16,394
Martin Blower represents
damn near most of the village.

657
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:18,020
Did you want us to go through
the whole phone book?

658
00:41:18,104 --> 00:41:20,898
Yeah, or put a call into Aaron A. Aaronson,
shall we?

659
00:41:20,982 --> 00:41:22,316
Please, don't be childish.

660
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,693
At least consider interviewing the widow.

661
00:41:23,776 --> 00:41:25,862
Martin Blower was clearly having
an affair with Eve Draper.

662
00:41:25,945 --> 00:41:29,365
Oh, and how did you establish that?

663
00:41:29,449 --> 00:41:32,201
'Cause we sat through three hours
of so-called acting last night,

664
00:41:32,285 --> 00:41:34,704
and the kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

665
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:36,873
All right, pipe down, big one.

666
00:41:36,956 --> 00:41:39,500
Here, what else you got,
Crockett and Tubby?

667
00:41:39,584 --> 00:41:42,003
- Skid marks.
- Now who's being childish?

668
00:41:42,086 --> 00:41:43,921
There were no skid marks at the scene.

669
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:46,966
Doesrt it seem a little strange that
Martin Blower would lose control of his car

670
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:48,968
and not think to apply the brakes?

671
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:50,887
If there were no skid marks it follows

672
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:54,891
that for 300 yards both driver and passenger
did nothing to prevent their fate.

673
00:41:54,974 --> 00:41:56,976
You don't have to be a detective
to work that out!

674
00:41:57,059 --> 00:41:58,227
Yeah.

675
00:41:58,311 --> 00:42:01,397
- Are you causing trouble?
- Yes, they are.

676
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:04,692
Well, a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.

677
00:42:04,775 --> 00:42:08,279
Old Arthur Webley's been clipping
hedgerows that don't belong to him.

678
00:42:08,362 --> 00:42:10,072
- Yes, sir?
- That's it.

679
00:42:11,073 --> 00:42:12,200
Yes, sir.

680
00:42:18,164 --> 00:42:21,501
- Why do we need the dog?
- It's not the dog we need.

681
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:24,629
(CHATTERING INCOHERENTLY)

682
00:42:29,258 --> 00:42:30,343
Right.

683
00:42:30,426 --> 00:42:31,552
What did he say?

00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,721
(CHATTERING INCOHERENTLY)

685
00:42:37,433 --> 00:42:39,101
- What did he say?
- He said, "An 'edge is an 'edge.

686
00:42:39,185 --> 00:42:40,770
"He only chopped it down
'cause it spoilt his view.

687

"What's Reaper moaning about?"

688
00:42:42,355 --> 00:42:43,439
Right.

689
00:42:43,523 --> 00:42:44,857
Look, I appreciate your position,
Mr Webley,

690
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:48,111
but you can't go around chopping down
other people's hedges without permission.

691
00:42:50,154 --> 00:42:51,489
"Yes, I suppose."

692
00:42:51,572 --> 00:42:52,698
Thank you.

693
00:42:53,449 --> 00:42:54,951
All right.

694
00:42:56,619 --> 00:42:59,455
Mr Webley,
I trust you have a licence for that firearm?

695
00:43:01,833 --> 00:43:03,417
He does for this one.

696
00:43:05,169 --> 00:43:06,629
What do you mean by "this one"?

697
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:22,895
By the power of Grey Skull.

698
00:43:22,979 --> 00:43:24,939
Where on earth did you get these?

699
00:43:25,022 --> 00:43:26,941
- Found them.
- He found them!

700
00:43:27,024 --> 00:43:30,611
- And what is this?
- Sea mine.

701
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:32,238
Sea mine.

702
00:43:32,488 --> 00:43:35,032
Well, Mr Webley,
this is an extremely dangerous collection.

703
00:43:35,116 --> 00:43:36,617
It's a wonder nobody's been hurt before.

704
00:43:36,701 --> 00:43:38,703
No, it's just a lot of junk.

- No, apparently it's been deactivated. Over.</i>

That's right, deactivated!

Well, you know, I mean, maybe
we should do something to celebrate.

that isn't a cranberry juice?

Oh, we got red or white.

- I'll have a pint of lager, please.
- Yeah, Roy.

- Any news from earlier?
- Yeah. CSI found nothing.

727

Doctor Hatcher reported no misadventure
and Mrs Blower has four alibis.

728
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:45,788
Now, come on, Sergeant, it's not your job
to investigate this incident, is it?

729
00:45:46,581 --> 00:45:47,748
Is it?

I mean,
what made you wanna be a policeman?

00:46:06,559 --> 00:46:07,643
Officer.

736
00:46:07,727 --> 00:46:10,313
What made you wanna be
a policeman-officer?

737
00:46:12,857 --> 00:46:16,277
I don't remember a time
when I didn't wanna be a police officer.

738
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:20,114
Apart from the summer of 1979
when I wanted to be Kermit the Frog.

739
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:25,119
It all started with my Uncle Derek.
He was a Sergeant in the Met.

740
00:46:25,203 --> 00:46:28,122
He bought me a police pedal car
when I was five.

741
00:46:28,206 --> 00:46:30,333
I rode round in it every second I was awake.

742
00:46:30,416 --> 00:46:33,795
Arresting kids twice my size
for littering and spitting.

743
00:46:33,878 --> 00:46:36,964
I got beaten up a lot when I was young
but it didn't stop me.

744
00:46:37,048 --> 00:46:38,966
I wanted to be like Uncle Derek.

745
00:46:39,050 --> 00:46:40,134
He sounds like a good bloke.

746
00:46:40,218 --> 00:46:42,553
Actually, he was arrested
for selling drugs to students.

747
00:46:42,637 --> 00:46:43,763
What a cunt.

748
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:46,265
Probably bought the pedal car
with the proceeds.

749
00:46:46,349 --> 00:46:49,644
Needless to say I never went near it again.
I just let it rust.

750
00:46:49,727 --> 00:46:51,771
But I never forgot
the clear sense of right and wrong

751
00:46:51,854 --> 00:46:53,856
that I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.

752
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,567
I had to prove to myself
that the law could be proper

753
00:46:56,651 --> 00:46:59,028
and righteous
and for the good of humankind.

754
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:02,740
It was from that moment,
I was destined to be a police officer.

755
00:47:03,366 --> 00:47:05,368
- Shame.
- How so?

756
00:47:05,451 --> 00:47:07,995
I think you would've made a great muppet.

757
00:47:11,624 --> 00:47:14,502
What about you? What made you
wanna become a police officer?

758
00:47:14,877 --> 00:47:18,005
I don't know. Dad does it.

759
00:47:18,089 --> 00:47:22,260
I think after my mum died, it's what
he wanted, you know, keep me close by.

760
00:47:22,343 --> 00:47:26,347
- Do you mind if I ask how she died?
- Traffic collision.

761
00:47:27,140 --> 00:47:28,516
I'm sorry.

762
00:47:29,684 --> 00:47:31,894

767
00:47:52,748 --> 00:47:55,543

- Mr Skinner.

768
00:47:55,626 --> 00:47:58,212
- You know George Merchant, don't you?
- Evening, Officer.

769
00:47:58,296 --> 00:48:01,215
Yes, we were just discussing the accident.

770
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:04,719
I'd come to know Martin
and Eve very well of late.

771
00:48:04,802 --> 00:48:06,345
Such a loss.

772
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:08,890
What say we drink to their demise?

773
00:48:08,973 --> 00:48:10,516
Shouldrt that be "drink to their memories"?

774
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,852
Of course. Cheers.

775
00:48:12,935 --> 00:48:14,770
I must go to the little boys' room.

776
00:48:16,147 --> 00:48:18,900
- GEORGE: I'm all right!
- "Little" being the operative word.

777
00:48:19,484 --> 00:48:22,069
Oh, he'll be in bits tomorrow.

778
00:48:30,870 --> 00:48:33,539
I think somebody needs to go home.

779
00:48:33,623 --> 00:48:37,418
- I'm... I'm not that drunk, sir.
- Not you. Him.

780
00:48:39,504 --> 00:48:40,838
What?

781
00:48:42,089 --> 00:48:45,968
Hey, we did get a little drunk.
Did you get it?

782
00:48:46,052 --> 00:48:48,763
'Cause he's... He's little and he's drunk.

783
00:48:50,598 --> 00:48:52,517
Oh, good grief.

784
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:55,812
It's hardly in keeping
with the village's rustic aesthetic, is it?

785
00:48:57,688 --> 00:49:00,191
- How much do I owe you?
- Twenty quid.

786
00:49:00,274 --> 00:49:02,276
There you go.

787
00:49:02,777 --> 00:49:04,987
- And there's your change.
- God bless you.

788
00:49:05,655 --> 00:49:06,906

- About five years ago.

- You should get some house plants.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

801
00:50:07,967 --> 00:50:10,803
Yeah. I've been tending my Peace Lily
for about three years now.

802
00:50:12,388 --> 00:50:15,933
It oxygenates the room,
helps you think, relieves stress.

- What?

806

- 'Cause you did it with a plant?
- No, no, no.

807
00:50:32,074 --> 00:50:35,620
It was more about me being
obsessed with the job.

808
00:50:35,912 --> 00:50:38,247
That's good though, right?

"What's your perfect Sunday?"

- ANGEL: Maybe.

to see Mr Merchant alive.

Oh, no!

928
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:18,559
Stand back, stand back!
There's been a terrible accident.

929
00:59:18,643 --> 00:59:21,354
- Accident?
- Just an accident.

930
00:59:21,979 --> 00:59:24,732
It's all right, it's all right.
There's nothing to see.

Come on, everybody. It's all right.
It's just an accident.

<i>FRANK: Nicholas, what is it?</i>

933
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:43,126
Sir, I think all these deaths are linked.
I think Tim Messenger was murdered.

934
00:59:43,543 --> 00:59:46,712
- Who could do something like this?
- Maybe it was the swan.

935
00:59:46,796 --> 00:59:49,882
- Apparently, they can break a mars arm.
- Or blow up a mars house.

936
00:59:49,966 --> 00:59:52,927
- Listen, you pair of...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nicholas.

937
00:59:53,427 --> 00:59:55,763
Now, let me get this straight.

938
00:59:56,764 --> 01:00:00,768
- Are you saying that this is a crime scene?
- Yes, sir, I am.

939
01:00:00,852 --> 01:00:02,228
Very well.

940
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:03,855
- Detectives.
- Sir.

941
01:00:03,938 --> 01:00:05,523
Start interviewing everyone
who was at the fete.

942

Oh, he's got shorts on.

- What?

944
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:09,402
- Secure the area.
- What?

945
01:00:09,485 --> 01:00:10,695
- PC Thatcher?
- Yes, love?

946
01:00:10,778 --> 01:00:12,405
Get the CSI down here.

947
01:00:12,488 --> 01:00:13,698
PC Walker?

948
01:00:13,781 --> 01:00:16,075
Patrol the churchyard with Saxon.

949
01:00:16,159 --> 01:00:19,370
Nicholas, Danny, you know what to do.

950
01:00:25,668 --> 01:00:27,837
Do you really think this is murder?

951
01:00:28,004 --> 01:00:29,589
I just don't think we should rule it out,
that's all.

952
01:00:29,672 --> 01:00:31,174
Yeah. I think you're right.

953
01:00:31,257 --> 01:00:33,509
I think you're talking a load of old shit.

954

He thinks you're talking a load of shit.
Swings and roundabouts, isn't it?

- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.

957
01:00:41,434 --> 01:00:43,269
I was extremely shocked
when I looked at my watch

958
01:00:43,352 --> 01:00:44,771
and discovered that I should be in the pub.

Did you read his articles?

This ain't the city, Mr Angel.
Not everyone's a murdering psychopath.

It's high time you realised that.
You and your monkey.

Did he mean me or that?

965
01:01:07,585 --> 01:01:09,796
Oh, maybe we should go home.

966
01:01:10,004 --> 01:01:13,090
- What do you mean?
- Well, there's nothing going on, is there?

967
01:01:13,174 --> 01:01:14,801
Have you listened to anything that I've said?

968
01:01:14,884 --> 01:01:16,010
What do you mean?

969
01:01:16,093 --> 01:01:17,637
Is anything I've told you
in the last two weeks

970
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:19,764
- sunk into that thick skull of yours?
- Yeah.

971
01:01:19,847 --> 01:01:21,557
Has it? Like what?

972
01:01:22,099 --> 01:01:24,018
You said I could be
an amazing policeman-officer.

973
01:01:24,102 --> 01:01:26,521
There's always something going on, Danny.

974
01:01:26,604 --> 01:01:30,233
And you won't be an amazing police officer
until you understand that.

975
01:01:30,316 --> 01:01:32,693
Well, I remembered something else
you said and all.

976
01:01:32,777 --> 01:01:34,403
- Oh, did you now?
- Yeah.

977

- All right?

981
01:02:56,360 --> 01:02:58,279
Thanks for the monkey.

01:02:59,113 --> 01:03:01,657
- Yours, isn't it?
- I won it for you.

983
01:03:05,286 --> 01:03:07,246
Danny, I think I'm on to something.

01:03:07,330 --> 01:03:08,498
- Are you?
- Yes.

985
01:03:08,581 --> 01:03:12,919
And I think with a little deliberation
we can figure out what links these deaths.

- Come on, partner. Let's go to work.

Oh, oh, Sergeant Angel?

988
01:03:19,926 --> 01:03:24,555
- Someone from London called for you.
- Tell them I'll call them back.

01:03:25,389 --> 01:03:26,516
- Tim Messenger.

- Pissed on the floor in The Crown.

- Affirmatron.
- Leading light of the local drama society.

- Bad actor.
- Undoubtedly.

- Bad driver.
- Not necessarily.

1002
01:03:49,235 --> 01:03:50,903
- Cheated on his missus.
- Most certainly.

- And we both know who with.
- Eve Draper.

- Blower's leading lady. Distinctive laugh.
- True.

- Favoured older men.
- Fingered.

- Council.

to build his dubious mansion
on Norris Avenue.

1010

1011
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:11,048
Maybe they were all accidents.

1021
01:04:42,997 --> 01:04:44,415
Hello, Miss Tiller.

1022
01:04:44,498 --> 01:04:47,209
I was wondering,
do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?

1023
01:04:47,293 --> 01:04:48,711
Of course.

1024
01:04:49,462 --> 01:04:51,922
I was just about to pop off, actually.

1025
01:04:52,757 --> 01:04:55,050
I can never find my scissors.

1026
01:04:55,301 --> 01:04:59,263
- Is this for someone special?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

1027
01:05:01,682 --> 01:05:06,312
- Are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller?
- Yes. I'm moving away.

1028
01:05:07,438 --> 01:05:10,608
And why the move,
if you don't mind me asking?

1029
01:05:10,691 --> 01:05:15,529
- Well, just between you and I...
- Yes?

1030
01:05:15,738 --> 01:05:18,657
- You know that fella who blew up?
- George Merchant.

1031
01:05:18,741 --> 01:05:21,911
Well, George Merchant, God rest him,
wanted to buy this land,

1032
01:05:21,994 --> 01:05:25,581
so he sends round his legal fella,
Martin Blower, God rest him,

1033
01:05:25,664 --> 01:05:27,792
and I thought I might take them up on it.

1034
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:31,587
I haven't really got that much family
round here, save for Cousin Sissy.

1035
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:35,132
So I thought I might take them up
on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.

1036
01:05:35,216 --> 01:05:37,218
Would you like a card with this?

1037
01:05:37,384 --> 01:05:39,678
No, sorry, you were talking about the offer?

1038
01:05:39,762 --> 01:05:42,973
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower,
God rest him,

1039
01:05:43,057 --> 01:05:45,226
knew where the new bypass road is going

1040
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:48,395
because he was knocking off Eve Draper
from the council, God rest her,

1041
01:05:48,479 --> 01:05:52,191
and then that reporter, God rest him,
finds out about the route

1042
01:05:52,274 --> 01:05:54,401
and tells me this land's very valuable.

1043
01:05:54,485 --> 01:05:58,572
Ten times what George Merchant and
Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.

1044
01:05:58,656 --> 01:06:01,659
So, with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it on myself

1045
01:06:01,742 --> 01:06:04,537
to some folks from the city
that Martin, George and Eve,

1046
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,664
God rest the lot of them,
had been talking to.

1047
01:06:06,747 --> 01:06:09,583
Apparently, they want to build
a big shopping centre or something.

1048
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:12,461
Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be
too happy about that,

1049
01:06:12,545 --> 01:06:14,630
but as far as I'm concerned,
Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...

1050
01:06:14,713 --> 01:06:17,341
Would you just excuse me,
for just one second?

1051
01:06:32,565 --> 01:06:33,774
Stop!

1052
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,277
In the name of the law!

You're saying this wasrt an accident?

1055
01:07:40,925 --> 01:07:42,968
Leslie Tiller was fucking murdered!

1056
01:07:43,052 --> 01:07:44,512
- What, just like Tim Messenger?
- Yes!

1057
01:07:44,595 --> 01:07:45,763
- And George Merchant?
- Yes!

1058
01:07:45,846 --> 01:07:47,098
- And Eve Draper?
- Yes!

1059
01:07:47,181 --> 01:07:48,808
- And Martin Blower?
- No, actually.

1060
01:07:48,891 --> 01:07:50,768
- Really?
- 'Course he fucking was!

1061
01:07:50,851 --> 01:07:52,770
Thank you, Danny.

1062
01:07:52,853 --> 01:07:56,190
Oh, murder, murder, murder.
Change the fucking record.

1063
01:07:56,774 --> 01:07:57,942
Thank you, Andy.

1064
01:07:58,025 --> 01:08:02,279
Come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept
it was just another nasty accident.

1065
01:08:02,363 --> 01:08:03,447
What are you suggesting?

1066
01:08:03,531 --> 01:08:06,033
That Leslie Tiller tripped
and fell on her own shears?

1067
01:08:06,117 --> 01:08:08,577
Ben Fletcher fell
on his pitchfork the other week.

1068
01:08:08,661 --> 01:08:12,123
Yeah, accidents happen all the time.
What makes you think it was murder?

1069
01:08:12,206 --> 01:08:15,167
- Because I was there!
- There's a point.

1070
01:08:15,251 --> 01:08:16,627
Why were you there?

1071
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:20,965
I was buying Constable Butterman
a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.

1072
01:08:21,048 --> 01:08:23,634
What absolute horseshit.

Innocent people don't run!

1074

Here, maybe it was our old friend,
the cactus thief.

1075
01:08:30,933 --> 01:08:33,644
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer,
werert he?

1076
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:37,189
Am I going completely mad?

1077
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:40,985
Maybe you are.

1078
01:08:42,903 --> 01:08:45,656
Maybe you did it.

1079
01:08:45,739 --> 01:08:49,076
Yeah, seeing as how you're such
a big fan of murder.

- Sergeant Angel?

Yes! Sir.

to the concepts you're bandying about.

The "M" word, Nicholas.

in Sandford for 20 years.

But, sir, I'm certain.

- I'm glad you asked.

1101
01:10:12,952 --> 01:10:15,121
My suspicions were first aroused
when you appeared

1102
01:10:15,204 --> 01:10:17,998
<i>at the scene of the Blower-Draper death,

<i>despite the fact you live and work
in the centre of the village.</i>

1104
01:10:23,129 --> 01:10:27,466
I couldn't help but recall your comments
at the theatre on the previous evening.

1105
01:10:27,716 --> 01:10:30,678
<i>When you not only indicated
an awareness of the couple's affair</i>

1106
01:10:30,761 --> 01:10:32,763
<i>but also inferred
that Eve's connections at the council</i>

1107
01:10:32,847 --> 01:10:35,808
<i>might make her privy
to important information.</i>

1108
01:10:35,891 --> 01:10:38,185
<i>You even spoke of "bashing her head in."</i>

1109
01:10:38,269 --> 01:10:41,897
Perhaps hoping you might discover
the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.

1110
01:10:41,981 --> 01:10:44,233
<i>You were already suspicious
that George Merchant was buying up</i>

1111
01:10:44,316 --> 01:10:46,610
a large area of land
on the outskirts of Sandford,

<i>after an article Tim Messenger
wrote in the Sandford Citizen.</i>

1113

You see, the land Merchant was buying
had little value in of itself but,

Consumed with concern for your business

1117
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,669
and potential disloyalty
from fickle customers,

1118
01:11:03,753 --> 01:11:06,338
you yourself expressed a wish to behead.

<i>Staging the murders as accidents.</i>

1121
01:11:11,594 --> 01:11:14,680
<i>You used a vehicle removal truck
to stage the Blower-Draper death</i>

1122
01:11:14,764 --> 01:11:16,682

1124

However, there was a loose end.

1125
01:11:24,064 --> 01:11:25,524
Tim Messenger.

1126
01:11:25,608 --> 01:11:27,777
<i>Splattered before he could share with me</i>

Upon discovering she was about
to sell up to the developers,

1130
01:11:37,119 --> 01:11:39,955
you brutally murdered her
with her own shears.

1131

And made good your escape utilising
your impressive skills as a fun runner.

Very entertaining. But I rather think
you've been watching too many films.

Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy."

1137

I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy
is only a revelation to yourself.

1138

are well known.

Thank you, Andrews.

1141
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:22,081
Now, despite my comments
about "beheading" customers,

1142
01:12:22,164 --> 01:12:25,709
I personally relish the competition
of another store.

And anyway, what makes you think
I could dislodge part of the church roof?

01:12:35,636 --> 01:12:38,097
Or for that matter, stage a car crash?

1146
01:12:38,180 --> 01:12:41,559
It's a well known fact that
the church roof is in dire need of repair.

1147
01:12:41,642 --> 01:12:43,811
And isn't it true
that two of your own employees

1148
01:12:43,894 --> 01:12:46,355
operate the vehicle removal service
for the council?

1149

Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.

Nevertheless, you could have utilised
the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

1154
01:13:03,038 --> 01:13:05,082
These accusations
are quite meaningless, Sergeant,

1155
01:13:05,166 --> 01:13:07,793
unless you can back them up
with hard evidence.

1156

Well, you've got me there.

to get embarrassing.

How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

1163

will absolve me.

I'm gonna... I'm gonna go after him.

1221
01:18:48,050 --> 01:18:50,386
Okay? It's Nicholas, by the way.

1222
01:18:52,471 --> 01:18:56,976
Oh, my God.
What happened to your Peace Lily?

1223
01:18:57,226 --> 01:19:01,147
Danny. Danny, just stay here, okay?
And watch him, and call your dad.

1224
01:19:01,230 --> 01:19:03,315
- Tell him I was right.
- What are you gonna do?

1225
01:19:03,399 --> 01:19:08,028
- I'm gonna bust this thing wide open.
- Nicholas, wait.

1226
01:19:08,112 --> 01:19:11,866
- You might need this.
- Thanks, partner.

1227
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:29,759
(CHANTING)

1228
01:19:45,065 --> 01:19:48,486
<i>SKINNER: How could I possibly be
in several places at once?</i>

How did it happen?</i>

1232
01:20:00,456 --> 01:20:03,542
<i>WEAVER: You'll find that we run
a very tight ship here.</i>

1233
01:20:03,626 --> 01:20:05,461
<i>REVEREND SHOO TER:
Who could do something like this?</i>

1234
01:20:05,544 --> 01:20:08,923
<i>HATCHER: Seems like Mr Merchant tried
to have a little fry up and left the gas on.</i>

1235
01:20:09,006 --> 01:20:10,341
<i>HATCHER: Nasty way to go.</i>

1236
01:20:10,424 --> 01:20:11,550
<i>AMANDA: What happened, Danny?</i>

1237
01:20:11,634 --> 01:20:13,469
<i>ANNETTE:
No luck catching them killers, then?</i>

1238
01:20:13,552 --> 01:20:15,429
<i>No luck catching them killers, then?</i>

1239
01:20:15,513 --> 01:20:17,723
<i>No luck catching them...</i>

1240
01:20:21,185 --> 01:20:23,604
Now, quick announcement before we begin.

1241
01:20:23,687 --> 01:20:28,067
Janet Barker has decided
to call her boys Roger and Martin.

1242
01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:33,447
And the christening will be
a week on Saturday and we're all invited.

1243
01:20:33,697 --> 01:20:36,033
- Tom.
- Thanks, Joyce.

1244
01:20:36,242 --> 01:20:39,370
Now, you'll all be delighted to hear

1245
01:20:39,453 --> 01:20:44,125
that the tenacious Sergeant Angel
has been taken care of.

1246
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:49,797
Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying
on the wet floor of his bathroom,

1247
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:54,135
having slipped
and tragically broken his neck.

1248
01:20:54,218 --> 01:20:56,303
So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant,

1249
01:20:56,387 --> 01:21:00,474
we will now be able to concentrate
on the eradication of our hoodie infestation.

1250
01:21:00,558 --> 01:21:01,642
Quite right.

1251
01:21:01,725 --> 01:21:05,187
After which, nothing will stand in our way.

1252
01:21:05,271 --> 01:21:08,149
Oh, I beg to differ, Mr Weaver.

1253
01:21:08,232 --> 01:21:12,486
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

1254
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:15,990
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
Sandford Police Service.

1255
01:21:16,073 --> 01:21:18,826
My, he is tenacious, isn't he?

1256
01:21:18,909 --> 01:21:21,787
I'm arresting you under suspicion
of conspiracy to commit murder.

1257
01:21:21,871 --> 01:21:24,665
Oh, come, come, Sergeant.

1258
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:26,333
You should be ashamed.

1259
01:21:26,417 --> 01:21:30,004
- Calling yourself a community that cares.
- Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.

1260
01:21:30,087 --> 01:21:31,839
It's all about the greater good.

1261
01:21:31,922 --> 01:21:33,424
ALL: The greater good.

1262
01:21:33,507 --> 01:21:35,009
How can this be for the greater good?

1263
01:21:35,092 --> 01:21:36,635
ALL: The greater good.

1264
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,846
You see, as much as I enjoyed
your wild theories, Sergeant,

1265
01:21:38,929 --> 01:21:40,639
the truth is far less complex.

1266
01:21:40,723 --> 01:21:45,936
Blower's fate was simply the result
of his being an appalling actor.

1267
01:21:47,438 --> 01:21:48,689
ALL: Quite appalling.

1268
01:21:48,773 --> 01:21:50,524
You murdered him for that?

1269
01:21:51,609 --> 01:21:54,028
- Well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare.
- What?

1270
01:21:54,111 --> 01:21:57,615
The Dramatic Society
is an important feather in our cap.

1271
01:21:57,948 --> 01:21:59,408
<i>HATCHER: Couldrt let
Blower jeopardise that.</i>

1272
01:21:59,492 --> 01:22:01,744
Not when we had two semi-professionals
waiting in the wings.

1273
01:22:01,827 --> 01:22:04,413
<i>Let's not forget that Greg
was an extra in Straw Dogs.</i>

1274
01:22:04,497 --> 01:22:06,373
<i>And Sheree played a cadaver
in Prime Suspect.</i>

1275
01:22:06,457 --> 01:22:07,875
Yes, I know!

1276
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:10,586
Martin was less concerned
with the reputation of the village

1277
01:22:10,669 --> 01:22:13,881
than he was with his sordid affair
with Eve Draper.

1278
01:22:13,964 --> 01:22:15,549
And so Eve deserved to die too?

1279
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:18,052
Well, she did have a very annoying laugh.

1280
01:22:18,135 --> 01:22:19,386
ALL: Annoying.

1281
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:22,306
- And, and George Merchant?
- He had an awful house.

1282
01:22:22,598 --> 01:22:23,682
ALL: Awful.

1283
01:22:23,766 --> 01:22:25,434
We begged him in vain
to make his residence

1284
01:22:25,518 --> 01:22:28,062
more in keeping
with the village's rustic aesthetic.

1285
01:22:29,146 --> 01:22:31,732
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

1286
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:36,529
<i>Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of
the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.</i>

1287
01:22:36,612 --> 01:22:40,449
Our once great paper had
become riddled with tabloid journalism.

1288
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:42,493
<i>Not to mention persistent errors.</i>

1289
01:22:42,576 --> 01:22:45,830
- He listed her age as 55.
- When, actually, I'm 53.

1290
01:22:45,913 --> 01:22:47,415
Fifty-three.

1291
01:22:47,498 --> 01:22:49,166
What, what about Leslie Tiller?
One of your own?

1292
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,752
Her horticultural expertise helped
put Sandford on the map.

1293
01:22:51,836 --> 01:22:53,879
Oh, she was ever so good.

1294
01:22:53,963 --> 01:22:56,132
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

1295
01:22:56,424 --> 01:23:00,136
But it seemed she was set on moving away.

1296
01:23:00,219 --> 01:23:03,597
We couldn't have her sharing
her green fingers with anybody else.

1297
01:23:03,681 --> 01:23:05,641
Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.

1298
01:23:05,724 --> 01:23:08,394
If we can't have her, no one can.

1299
01:23:08,477 --> 01:23:10,062
How can this be for the greater good?

1300
01:23:10,146 --> 01:23:12,189
- ALL: The greater good.
- Shut it!

1301
01:23:12,273 --> 01:23:15,443
These people died for no reason.
No reason whatsoever!

1302
01:23:15,526 --> 01:23:18,028
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1303
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,157
Hello, Nicholas.

1304
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:24,160
I was like you once.

1305
01:23:24,785 --> 01:23:28,205
I believed in the immutable word of the law.

1306
01:23:28,497 --> 01:23:32,334
That is until the night Mrs Butterman
was taken from me.

1307
01:23:33,252 --> 01:23:35,921
You see,
no one loved Sandford more than her.

1308
01:23:36,005 --> 01:23:40,009
She was head of the Womers Institute,
chair of the floral committee.

1309
01:23:40,092 --> 01:23:42,178
When they started
the Village of the Year contest,

1310
01:23:42,261 --> 01:23:45,973
she worked round the clock.
I've never seen such dedication.

1311
01:23:47,308 --> 01:23:52,646
On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival,
some travellers moved into Callahan Park.

1312
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:56,984
Before you could say, "Gypsy scum,"
we were knee-deep in dog muck,

1313
01:23:57,067 --> 01:23:59,403
thieving kids and crusty jugglers.

1314
01:23:59,487 --> 01:24:01,238
ALL: Crusty jugglers.

1315
01:24:01,322 --> 01:24:04,408
We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.

1316
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:09,538
She drove her Datsun Cherry
into Sandford Gorge.

1317
01:24:09,622 --> 01:24:14,752
From that moment on,
I swore that I would do her proud.

1318
01:24:15,086 --> 01:24:19,590
And whatever the cost,
we would make Sandford great again.

1319
01:24:19,924 --> 01:24:21,801
Sir, this doesn't make any sense.

1320
01:24:21,884 --> 01:24:25,763
The adjudicators arrive tomorrow.
We had to get everything ready.

1321
01:24:25,846 --> 01:24:28,557
Are you saying this is all about
winning the Best Village Award?

1322
01:24:28,641 --> 01:24:32,353
This is the best village, Nicholas.
You've seen the people.

1323
01:24:32,436 --> 01:24:36,899
- They're happy, contented.
- They're living in a dream world.

1324
01:24:36,982 --> 01:24:39,610
Sergeant Popwell
thought much the same as you.

1325
01:24:39,693 --> 01:24:41,737
I'm disappointed
you can't see the bigger picture.

1326
01:24:41,821 --> 01:24:44,240
Well, I'm happy to disappoint you, sir.

1327
01:24:44,323 --> 01:24:46,075
And I'm afraid
you're gonna have to come with me.

1328
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:48,244
You are all gonna have to come with me.

1329
01:24:48,327 --> 01:24:52,415
No, Nicholas, I'm afraid it is you

1330
01:24:52,498 --> 01:24:55,251
who is going to have to come with us.

1331
01:25:03,259 --> 01:25:04,885
Danny, no.

1332
01:25:09,265 --> 01:25:10,766
Back off! Back off!

1333
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:13,102
Or I swear to God,
you'll be explaining how Danny tripped over

1334
01:25:13,185 --> 01:25:14,645
and accidentally cut off his own head.

1335
01:25:14,728 --> 01:25:16,897
Come on, Nicholas.
You haven't got it in you.

1336
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:18,315
I mean it!

1337
01:25:21,986 --> 01:25:23,237

Ta-da.

- (WHISPERING) What are you doing?
- Saving your skin.

1353

- This is murder!
- It's not, it's ketchup.

1354

I'm not talking about that,
I'm talking about the others.

- What others?
- The others the NWA have murdered.

- That's not true.
- It is!

1357
01:27:22,189 --> 01:27:24,358
Dad just said it was his special club, he...

1358
01:27:24,442 --> 01:27:26,318
I thought it was about
rapping people on the knuckles

1359
01:27:26,402 --> 01:27:29,613
- and sending them on their way.
- There are skeletons back there!

It's Frank.

1363

He's appointed himself judge,
jury and executioner.
