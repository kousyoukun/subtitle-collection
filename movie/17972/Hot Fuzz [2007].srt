- Yes, he's living out of cardboard boxes.

- You want to take this higher?
- Yes, yes, I do.

You want me to bother
the Chief Inspector with this?

Yes.

67
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:16,280
You want me to get the Chief Inspector
to come all the way down here?

68

307
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,280
Yeah, 'cause we all sell apples round here,
don't we?

308
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,080
- Your dad sells apples, Andy.
- And raspberries.

309
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,640
I bet you can't wait to jump
into Sergeant Popwell's grave.

310
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,800
I'm not jumping into anyone's grave.

311
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,240
- You got a moustache.
- I know.

312
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:46,920
- Why have you got your stab vest on?
- It's a requirement.

313
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,120
In the city maybe.
Nobody's gonna stab you in here, Sergeant.

314
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,320
Not a member of the public anyhow.

315
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,960
- Have you been stabbed, Sergeant Fisher?
- No.

316
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,400
Well, I have.

317
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,960
And I can assure you
it is not in the least bit amusing.

318
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:06,000
Have you seen a lot of action,
Sergeant Angel?

319
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,920
I've experienced my fair share, yes.

320
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,400
- Did you cook any fools?
- Excuse me?

321
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,680
Did you shoot anybody?

322
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,960
He shot a crack head with a Kalashnikov.

323
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:19,080
- Where did you get that?
- The offender had the Kalashnikov.

324
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,200
Where'd he get that?

325

in the country than there are in the city?

326

is packing round here.

330

It was the single most painful
experience of my life.

331

- Yes, I have.

- Simon Skinner, I believe you've met.
- Oh, we're already firm friends.

357

Well, I haven't held a firearm
for over two years, Mr Reaper.

358
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,200
I'd quite like to keep it that way.

I want to ask you,
would you read a homily at Sunday Service?

363
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,520
That might be
a little hypocritical of me, Reverend.

I'm open to the concept of religion,
I'm just not entirely convinced by it.

370
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,520
Well, all that remains is to welcome you

371
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:33,000
to the weekly meeting
of the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance.

373
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:41,840
Janet Barker has just given birth to twins.

374

So, congratulations to her.

375

- Thanks, Joyce.

376

Now.

I am sure that all of you will have noticed
the return of a blight to our streets.

378

It's made all the more disturbing as
the Village of the Year contest looms.

It's about two foot tall.

pulled down like that?

- He's fuck ugly.
- Or he doesn't want you to see his face.

00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,160
Because he's fuck ugly.

432

What do you mean,
he doesn't wanna press charges?

489

I'm simply suggesting that, you know,
Peter be given a second chance

- Mr Skinner...
- Is everything all right?

Well, sir, Mr Skinner feels it would
be better not to prosecute an individual

- Everything you're saying.

I might need to refer to it later.

Now, Officer, I am a respected solicitor

Thought you might wanna do something.

- Don't know. Pub?

It was very enjoyable.

- I don't think so.

A pleasure, my liege.

- Eve's nice, ain't she?
- She certainly has a distinctive laugh.

She was in my year at school.

we done for speeding earlier.

613
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,560
Yeah. Hopefully,
that's the last we'll see of him.

614
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,320
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

615
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,680
Who is it?

616
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,160
We haven't got long.

617
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:22,200
To us.

618
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,240
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

619
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,520

621
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,200
Yeah?

622

<i>...decaffeinated?</i>
- Decaffeinated?

623
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:50,080
Little Brian Libby found them,
out on his paper round.

624
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,560
Oh, he'll be having nightmares for a while.

625
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:57,760
Must have hit the sign at some speed.
Took the whole top off.

626
00:37:57,840 --> 00:38:00,760
- I've had my top off in this lay-by.
- Tits.

627
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:07,120
Most likely lost control,
left the road there and then ended up here.

628
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:12,880
So, what do we reckon?

629
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:15,040
Sergeant Angel?

630
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:18,320
Well, we should get a proper cordon off,
screen the remains from public view.

631
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:20,040
Close down the road
until the ambulance crew arrives,

632
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,320
whereupon we should open
a single lane of traffic and ease congestion.

633
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,120
Very good.

634
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:26,800
What he said.

635
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:34,000
- What happened, Danny?
- Car accident.

636
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,760
Nasty way to go.

637
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,480
Constable, official vocab guidelines state

638
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,520
we no longer refer to these incidents
as "accidents," they're now "collisions."

639
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,640
Right.

640
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:48,600
"For never was there a story of more woe.
Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

641
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,400
- Excuse me?
- Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

642
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,000
Mr Skinner, do you mind telling me

643
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,200
how you know the identity
of the persons involved?

644
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,600
You know how it is. News travels fast.

645
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,760
<i>♪ A love struck Romeo</i>
<i>♪ sings a streetsuss serenade</i>

646
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,640
- What happened, Danny?
- Traffic collision.

647
00:39:07,840 --> 00:39:09,680
Hey, why can't we say "accident" again?

648
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:12,120
Because "accident" implies
there's nobody to blame.

649
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,920
Put a sock in it, town mouse.

650
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:18,600
Yeah, you wanna be a big cop in
a small town, fuck off up the model village.

651
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:21,000
I'm just saying,
things aren't always as simple as they look.

652
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:22,840
Most times they are.

653
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,560
Let's just wait till Doctor Hatcher
comes back with something,

654
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:28,120
before you go jumping the Kalashnikov.

655
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:31,200
All right, in the meantime, why don't you
check out a few of Martin Blower's clients?

656
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,040
Martin Blower represents
damn near most of the village.

657
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,600
Did you want us to go through
the whole phone book?

658
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,360
Yeah, or put a call into Aaron A. Aaronson,
shall we?

659
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,720
Please, don't be childish.

660
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:41,040
At least consider interviewing the widow.

661
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,120
Martin Blower was clearly having
an affair with Eve Draper.

662
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,480
Oh, and how did you establish that?

663
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,200
'Cause we sat through three hours
of so-called acting last night,

664
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:51,600
and the kiss was
the only convincing moment in it.

665
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,680
All right, pipe down, big one.

666
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,200
Here, what else you got,
Crockett and Tubby?

667
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,600
- Skid marks.
- Now who's being childish?

668
00:39:58,680 --> 00:40:00,440
There were no skid marks at the scene.

669
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,360
Doesn't it seem a little strange that
Martin Blower would lose control of his car

670
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,280
and not think to apply the brakes?

671
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,120
If there were no skid marks it follows

672
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:10,960
that for 300 yards both driver and passenger
did nothing to prevent their fate.

673
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,960
You don't have to be a detective
to work that out!

674
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,160
Yeah.

675
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:17,200
- Are you causing trouble?
- Yes, they are.

676
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,360
Well, a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.

677
00:40:20,440 --> 00:40:23,800
Old Arthur Webley's been clipping
hedgerows that don't belong to him.

678
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:25,520
- Yes, sir?
- That's it.

679
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:27,560
Yes, sir.

680
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:36,480
- Why do we need the dog?
- It's not the dog we need.

(CHATTERING INCOHERENTLY)

00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:57,520
Right.

Look, I appreciate your position,
Mr Webley,

690
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:02,000
but you can't go around chopping down
other people's hedges without permission.

691
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:05,240
"Yes, I suppose."

Mr Webley,
I trust you have a licence for that firearm?

695

He does for this one.

696

What do you mean by "this one"?

697

By the power of Grey Skull.

698
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:37,320
Where on earth did you get these?

699
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,240
- Found them.
- He found them!

700
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:42,760
- And what is this?
- Sea mine.

701
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,320
Sea mine.

702
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:47,000
Well, Mr Webley,
this is an extremely dangerous collection.

703
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,520
It's a wonder nobody's been hurt before.

704
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,520
No, it's just a lot of junk.

we should do something to celebrate.

that isn't a cranberry juice?

Oh, we got red or white.

- Any news from earlier?
- Yeah. CSI found nothing.

Doctor Hatcher reported no misadventure
and Mrs Blower has four alibis.

728

Now, come on, Sergeant, it's not your job
to investigate this incident, is it?

00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:54,280
Is it?

Officer.

00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:15,920
What made you wanna be
a policeman-officer?

737
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:21,640
I don't remember a time
when I didn't wanna be a police officer.

738
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,320
Apart from the summer of 1979
when I wanted to be Kermit the Frog.

739
00:44:26,280 --> 00:44:30,120
It all started with my Uncle Derek.
He was a Sergeant in the Met.

740
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:33,000
He bought me a police pedal car
when I was five.

741
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:35,120
I rode round in it every second I was awake.

742
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:38,440
Arresting kids twice my size
for littering and spitting.

743
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:41,480
I got beaten up a lot when I was young
but it didn't stop me.

744
00:44:41,560 --> 00:44:43,400
I wanted to be like Uncle Derek.

745
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:44,520
He sounds like a good bloke.

746
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,840
Actually, he was arrested
for selling drugs to students.

747
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:48,000
What a cunt.

748
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:50,400
Probably bought the pedal car
with the proceeds.

749
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:53,640
Needless to say I never went near it again.
I just let it rust.

750
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:55,680
But I never forgot
the clear sense of right and wrong

751
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,680
that I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.

752
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:00,280
I had to prove to myself
that the law could be proper

753
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,640
and righteous
and for the good of humankind.

754
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,200
It was from that moment,
I was destined to be a police officer.

755
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,720
- Shame.
- How so?

756
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,240
I think you would've made a great muppet.

757
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,480
What about you? What made you
wanna become a police officer?

758
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:20,840
I don't know. Dad does it.

759
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:24,920
I think after my mum died, it's what
he wanted, you know, keep me close by.

760
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:28,840
- Do you mind if I ask how she died?
- Traffic collision.

761
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,920
I'm sorry.

762
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,160

- Evening, Officer.

769
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,280
Yes, we were just discussing the accident.

770
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:05,640
I'd come to know Martin
and Eve very well of late.

771

Such a loss.

772
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:09,640
What say we drink to their demise?

773
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,200
Shouldn't that be "drink to their memories"?

774
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:13,440
Of course. Cheers.

775

Hey, we did get a little drunk.
Did you get it?

782
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:47,880
'Cause he's... He's little and he's drunk.

with the village's rustic aesthetic, is it?

785
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:58,840
- How much do I owe you?
- Twenty quid.

787

Yeah. I've been tending my Peace Lily

- No, no, no.

807

It was more about me being
obsessed with the job.

924
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:34,840
Excuse me. Excuse me.

00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:38,400

00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:43,960
Oh, no!

928
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,880
Stand back, stand back!
There's been a terrible accident.

929
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:54,560
- Accident?
- Just an accident.

930
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:57,800
It's all right, it's all right.
There's nothing to see.

931
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:01,560
Come on, everybody. It's all right.
It's just an accident.

<i>FRANK: Nicholas, what is it?</i>

933
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,440
Sir, I think all these deaths are linked.
I think Tim Messenger was murdered.

934
00:57:15,840 --> 00:57:18,880
- Who could do something like this?
- Maybe it was the swan.

935
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:21,920
- Apparently, they can break a mans arm.
- Or blow up a mans house.

936
00:57:22,000 --> 00:57:24,840
- Listen, you pair of...
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, Nicholas.

937
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:27,560
Now, let me get this straight.

938
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,360
- Are you saying that this is a crime scene?
- Yes, sir, I am.

939
00:57:32,440 --> 00:57:33,760
Very well.

940
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:35,320
- Detectives.
- Sir.

941
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:36,920
Start interviewing everyone
who was at the fete.

942
00:57:37,000 --> 00:57:38,040
Oh, he's got shorts on.

943
00:57:38,120 --> 00:57:39,200
- Sergeant Fisher?
- What?

944
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:40,640
- Secure the area.
- What?

945
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:41,880
- PC Thatcher?
- Yes, love?

946
00:57:41,960 --> 00:57:43,520
Get the CSI down here.

947
00:57:43,600 --> 00:57:44,760
PC Walker?

948
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,040
Patrol the churchyard with Saxon.

949
00:57:47,120 --> 00:57:50,200
Nicholas, Danny, you know what to do.

950
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,320
Do you really think this is murder?

951
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,000
I just don't think we should rule it out,
that's all.

952
00:58:00,080 --> 00:58:01,520
Yeah. I think you're right.

953
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,760
I think you're talking a load of old shit.

954

He thinks you're talking a load of shit.
Swings and roundabouts, isn't it?

CARTWRIGHT: Pain in the arse.

- Did you find anything?
- Yeah.

957
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:13,120
I was extremely shocked
when I looked at my watch

958
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:14,560
and discovered that I should be in the pub.

959
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,840
Did you go to his house?
Did you read his articles?

It's your job, isn't it? Detect!

962
00:58:22,240 --> 00:58:26,320
This ain't the city, Mr Angel.
Not everyone's a murdering psychopath.

963
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:29,760
It's high time you realised that.
You and your monkey.

964
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:34,840
Did he mean me or that?

965
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,560
Oh, maybe we should go home.

966
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,720
- What do you mean?
- Well, there's nothing going on, is there?

967
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:43,360
Have you listened to anything that I've said?

968
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:44,520
What do you mean?

969
00:58:44,600 --> 00:58:46,080
Is anything I've told you
in the last two weeks

970
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:48,120
- sunk into that thick skull of yours?
- Yeah.

971
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:49,840
Has it? Like what?

972
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,200
You said I could be
an amazing policeman-officer.

973
00:58:52,280 --> 00:58:54,600
There's always something going on, Danny.

974
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:58,160
And you won't be an amazing police officer
until you understand that.

975
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,520
Well, I remembered something else
you said and all.

976
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,160
- Oh, did you now?
- Yeah.

977
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,440
You don't know how to switch off!

- All right?

981
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,600
Thanks for the monkey.

01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:25,840

- I won it for you.

983
01:00:29,320 --> 01:00:31,200
Danny, I think I'm on to something.

- Are you?
- Yes.

985
01:00:32,480 --> 01:00:36,640
And I think with a little deliberation
we can figure out what links these deaths.

- Come on, partner. Let's go to work.

Oh, oh, Sergeant Angel?

988
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:47,800
- Someone from London called for you.
- Tell them I'll call them back.

989
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:49,680
- Tim Messenger.
- Go.

- Fondness for puns.
- Go on.

01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,000
- Terrible speller.
- Oh, yeah?

Nevertheless had uncovered
important information about...

- George Merchant.
- Self-made millionaire.

995

Fancied himself as a property developer.

996
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,840
- Said he had big plans for Sandford.
- Pissed on the floor in The Crown.

997
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:05,000
But more importantly,
was a good friend and client of...

998
01:01:05,080 --> 01:01:06,760
- Martin Blower.
- Respected solicitor.

999

- Affirmatron.
- Leading light of the local drama society.

1000
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:10,440
- Bad actor.
- Undoubtedly.

1001
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,000
- Bad driver.
- Not necessarily.

1002
01:01:12,080 --> 01:01:13,680
- Cheated on his missus.
- Most certainly.

1003
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:15,640
- And we both know who with.
- Eve Draper.

1004

- Blower's leading lady. Distinctive laugh.
- True.

1005
01:01:18,520 --> 01:01:19,880
- Favoured older men.
- Fingered.

1006
01:01:19,960 --> 01:01:21,160
- Worked at?
- Council.

1007
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,840
- More specifically?
- Department of Planning and Development.

1008
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:25,480
Where George Merchant secured permission

1009
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:27,840
to build his dubious mansion
on Norris Avenue.

1010
01:01:27,920 --> 01:01:29,000
So...

1011
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:33,000
Maybe they were all accidents.
People have accidents every day.

- We were working, weren't we?

(SIREN BLARING)

1021
01:02:03,640 --> 01:02:05,000
Hello, Miss Tiller.

1022
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,680
I was wondering,
do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?

1023
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:09,120
Of course.

1024
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:12,200
I was just about to pop off, actually.

1025
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:15,200
I can never find my scissors.

1026
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:19,240
- Is this for someone special?
- Yes. Yes, it is.

1027
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:26,000
- Are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller?
- Yes. I'm moving away.

1028
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,120
And why the move,
if you don't mind me asking?

1029
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:34,840
- Well, just between you and I...
- Yes?

1030
01:02:35,040 --> 01:02:37,840
- You know that fella who blew up?
- George Merchant.

1031
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,960
Well, George Merchant, God rest him,
wanted to buy this land,

1032
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:44,480
so he sends round his legal fella,
Martin Blower, God rest him,

1033
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,600
and I thought I might take them up on it.

1034
01:02:46,680 --> 01:02:50,240
I haven't really got that much family
round here, save for Cousin Sissy.

1035
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,640
So I thought I might take them up
on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.

1036
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:55,640
Would you like a card with this?

1037
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:58,000
No, sorry, you were talking about the offer?

1038
01:02:58,080 --> 01:03:01,160
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower,
God rest him,

1039
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:03,320
knew where the new bypass road is going

1040
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:06,360
because he was knocking off Eve Draper
from the council, God rest her,

1041
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:10,000
and then that reporter, God rest him,
finds out about the route

1042
01:03:10,080 --> 01:03:12,120
and tells me this land's very valuable.

1043
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,120
Ten times what George Merchant and
Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.

1044
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:19,080
So, with them having passed on,
I decided to sell it on myself

1045
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,840
to some folks from the city
that Martin, George and Eve,

1046
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:23,880
God rest the lot of them,
had been talking to.

1047
01:03:23,960 --> 01:03:26,680
Apparently, they want to build
a big shopping centre or something.

1048
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:29,440
Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be
too happy about that,

1049
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:31,520
but as far as I'm concerned,
Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...

1050
01:03:31,600 --> 01:03:34,120
Would you just excuse me,
for just one second?

1051
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:49,880
Stop!

1052
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:52,280
In the name of the law!

1053

<i>Hang about, hang about.</i>

1054
01:04:50,800 --> 01:04:53,000
You're saying this wasn't an accident?

1055
01:04:54,280 --> 01:04:56,240
Leslie Tiller was fucking murdered!

1056
01:04:56,320 --> 01:04:57,720
- What, just like Tim Messenger?
- Yes!

1057
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,920
- And George Merchant?
- Yes!

1058
01:04:59,000 --> 01:05:00,200
- And Eve Draper?
- Yes!

1059
01:05:00,280 --> 01:05:01,840
- And Martin Blower?
- No, actually.

1060
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,720
- Really?
- 'Course he fucking was!

1061
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,640
Thank you, Danny.

1062
01:05:05,720 --> 01:05:08,920
Oh, murder, murder, murder.
Change the fucking record.

1063
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:10,600
Thank you, Andy.

1064
01:05:10,680 --> 01:05:14,760
Come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept
it was just another nasty accident.

1065
01:05:14,840 --> 01:05:15,880
What are you suggesting?

1066
01:05:15,960 --> 01:05:18,360
That Leslie Tiller tripped
and fell on her own shears?

1067
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:20,800
Ben Fletcher fell
on his pitchfork the other week.

1068
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:24,200
Yeah, accidents happen all the time.
What makes you think it was murder?

1069
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:27,120
- Because I was there!
- There's a point.

1070
01:05:27,200 --> 01:05:28,520
Why were you there?

1071
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,680
I was buying Constable Butterman
a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.

1072
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:35,240
What absolute horseshit.

1073
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:39,120
I chased a suspect from the scene.
Innocent people don't run!

1074
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,160
Here, maybe it was our old friend,
the cactus thief.

1075
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,840
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer,
weren't he?

1076
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:48,240
Am I going completely mad?

1077
01:05:50,280 --> 01:05:51,880
Maybe you are.

1078
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,360
Maybe you did it.

1079
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:59,640
Yeah, seeing as how you're such
a big fan of murder.

1080
01:05:59,720 --> 01:06:01,080
- What the...
- Sergeant Angel?

1081
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:03,560
Yes! Sir.

1082
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:08,800
Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.

1083
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,360
What am I going to do with you?

1084
01:06:11,440 --> 01:06:15,800
- Sir, you have to understand...
- No, you have to understand.

1085
01:06:16,760 --> 01:06:20,560
The boys here aren't used
to the concepts you're bandying about.

1086
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:23,560
The "M" word, Nicholas.

1087
01:06:23,640 --> 01:06:27,680
There hasn't been a recorded murder
in Sandford for 20 years.

1088
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:29,520
But, sir, I'm certain.

1089
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:33,120
And what's more, I know who did it.

1090
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:40,760
Can I see the manager, please?

1091
01:06:46,040 --> 01:06:51,760
<i>Mr Skinner to the Manager's office.</i>
<i>Manager's office. Mr Skinner.</i>

And to what do I owe this pleasure?

1093

Simon Skinner, I'm arresting you
on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller.

the murder of Tim Messenger on May 1st,

1098
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:11,920

- I'm glad you asked.

1101
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,160
My suspicions were first aroused
when you appeared

1102
01:07:22,240 --> 01:07:24,920
<i>at the scene of the Blower-Draper death,</i>

<i>in the centre of the village.</i>

1104
01:07:29,840 --> 01:07:34,000
I couldn't help but recall your comments
at the theatre on the previous evening.

1105
01:07:34,240 --> 01:07:37,080
<i>When you not only indicated</i>
<i>an awareness of the couple's affair</i>

1106
01:07:37,160 --> 01:07:39,080
<i>but also inferred</i>
<i>that Eve's connections at the council</i>

1107
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:42,000

<i>to important information.</i>

<i>You even spoke of "bashing her head in."</i>

1109

Perhaps hoping you might discover
the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.

1110
01:07:47,920 --> 01:07:50,080
<i>You were already suspicious</i>
<i>that George Merchant was buying up</i>

1111

a large area of land
on the outskirts of Sandford,

1112
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,280
after an article Tim Messenger
wrote in the <i>Sandford Citizen.</i>

1113
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,880
You see, the land Merchant was buying
had little value in of itself but,

1116

Consumed with concern for your business

1117
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,720
and potential disloyalty
from fickle customers,

1118
01:08:08,800 --> 01:08:11,280
you yourself expressed a wish to behead.

1121
01:08:16,320 --> 01:08:19,280
<i>You used a vehicle removal truck</i>
<i>to stage the Blower-Draper death</i>

1122
01:08:19,360 --> 01:08:21,200

1124

However, there was a loose end.

1125
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:29,680
Tim Messenger.

1126
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:31,840
<i>Splattered before he could share with me</i>

Upon discovering she was about
to sell up to the developers,

1130
01:08:40,800 --> 01:08:43,520
you brutally murdered her
with her own shears.

1131

And made good your escape utilising
your impressive skills as a fun runner.

Very entertaining. But I rather think
you've been watching too many films.

Why would I kill Leslie?
You clearly aren't aware that we're related.

01:09:04,320 --> 01:09:06,800
Oh, but I am, "Cousin Sissy."

1137
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:12,400
I'm afraid my nickname of Sissy
is only a revelation to yourself.

are well known.

- Yeah, Sissy Skinner.

Thank you, Andrews.

Now, despite my comments
about "beheading" customers,

1142
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:27,400
I personally relish the competition
of another store.

1143

Anything to energise my workforce.

1144

And anyway, what makes you think
I could dislodge part of the church roof?

1145
01:09:36,920 --> 01:09:39,280
Or for that matter, stage a car crash?

1146
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:42,600
It's a well known fact that
the church roof is in dire need of repair.

1147
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,760
And isn't it true
that two of your own employees

1148
01:09:44,840 --> 01:09:47,200
operate the vehicle removal service
for the council?

1149

Sergeant, this is the 21st Century.

Many people hold down several jobs.

1151

I myself host a life drawing class
at the Village Hall.

Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.

1153
01:09:59,400 --> 01:10:03,120
Nevertheless, you could have utilised
the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

1154
01:10:03,200 --> 01:10:05,160
These accusations
are quite meaningless, Sergeant,

1155
01:10:05,240 --> 01:10:07,760
unless you can back them up
with hard evidence.

1156

Well, you've got me there.

1157

Something that placed you
at the scene of the crime.

a piece of broken glass this very evening.

1161
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,960
Sergeant, this is beginning
to get embarrassing.

1162
01:10:26,040 --> 01:10:29,080
How could I possibly be
in several places at once?

1163
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,760
I'm sure the store's security footage
will absolve me.

1165

Frank, this shit just got real.

1219
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:31,440
Skinner just sent someone to kill me,
and, now, now he's gone somewhere.

1220
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:34,000
Up to the... To the castle, I think.
I'm gonna... I'm gonna go after him.

1221
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:36,320
Okay? It's Nicholas, by the way.

1222
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:42,640
Oh, my God.
What happened to your Peace Lily?

1223
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,640
Danny. Danny, just stay here, okay?
And watch him, and call your dad.

1224
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:48,720
- Tell him I was right.
- What are you gonna do?

1225
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:53,240
- I'm gonna bust this thing wide open.
- Nicholas, wait.

1226
01:15:53,320 --> 01:15:56,920
- You might need this.
- Thanks, partner.

<i>No luck catching them...</i>

1240
01:17:03,400 --> 01:17:05,720
Now, quick announcement before we begin.

1241
01:17:05,800 --> 01:17:10,000
Janet Barker has decided
to call her boys Roger and Martin.

1242
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:15,160
And the christening will be
a week on Saturday and we're all invited.

1243
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,640
- Tom.
- Thanks, Joyce.

1244
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,840
Now, you'll all be delighted to hear

1245
01:17:20,920 --> 01:17:25,400
that the tenacious Sergeant Angel
has been taken care of.

1246
01:17:25,480 --> 01:17:30,840
Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying
on the wet floor of his bathroom,

1247
01:17:30,920 --> 01:17:35,000
having slipped
and tragically broken his neck.

1248
01:17:35,080 --> 01:17:37,080
So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant,

1249
01:17:37,160 --> 01:17:41,080
we will now be able to concentrate
on the eradication of our hoodie infestation.

1250
01:17:41,160 --> 01:17:42,200
Quite right.

1251
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:45,600
After which, nothing will stand in our way.

1252
01:17:45,680 --> 01:17:48,440
Oh, I beg to differ, Mr Weaver.

1253
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:52,600
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

1254
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,960
Sergeant Nicholas Angel.
Sandford Police Service.

1255
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,680
My, he is tenacious, isn't he?

1256
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:01,520
I'm arresting you under suspicion
of conspiracy to commit murder.

1257
01:18:01,600 --> 01:18:04,280
Oh, come, come, Sergeant.

1258
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:05,880
You should be ashamed.

1259
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:09,400
- Calling yourself a community that cares.
- Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.

1260
01:18:09,480 --> 01:18:11,160
It's all about the greater good.

1261
01:18:11,240 --> 01:18:12,680
ALL: The greater good.

1262
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:14,200
How can this be for the greater good?

1263
01:18:14,280 --> 01:18:15,760
ALL: The greater good.

1264
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,880
You see, as much as I enjoyed
your wild theories, Sergeant,

1265
01:18:17,960 --> 01:18:19,600
the truth is far less complex.

1266
01:18:19,680 --> 01:18:24,680
Blower's fate was simply the result
of his being an appalling actor.

1267
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:27,320
ALL: Quite appalling.

1268
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:29,080
You murdered him for that?

1269
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:32,440
- Well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare.
- What?

1270
01:18:32,520 --> 01:18:35,880
The Dramatic Society
is an important feather in our cap.

1271
01:18:36,200 --> 01:18:37,600
<i>HATCHER: Couldn't let</i>
<i>Blower jeopardise that.</i>

1272
01:18:37,680 --> 01:18:39,840
Not when we had two semi-professionals
waiting in the wings.

1273
01:18:39,920 --> 01:18:42,400
Let's not forget that Greg
was an extra in <i>Straw Dogs.</i>

1274
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,280
And Sheree played a cadaver
in <i>Prime Suspect.</i>

1275
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,720
Yes, I know!

1276
01:18:45,800 --> 01:18:48,320
Martin was less concerned
with the reputation of the village

1277
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,480
than he was with his sordid affair
with Eve Draper.

1278
01:18:51,560 --> 01:18:53,080
And so Eve deserved to die too?

1279
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,480
Well, she did have a very annoying laugh.

1280
01:18:55,560 --> 01:18:56,760
ALL: Annoying.

1281
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,560
- And, and George Merchant?
- He had an awful house.

1282
01:18:59,840 --> 01:19:00,880
ALL: Awful.

1283
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:02,560
We begged him in vain
to make his residence

1284
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:05,080
more in keeping
with the village's rustic aesthetic.

1285
01:19:06,120 --> 01:19:08,600
And what about Tim Messenger?
What was his crime?

1286
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:13,200
<i>Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of</i>
<i>the</i> Sandford Citizen <i>has been unbearable.</i>

1287
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,960
Our once great paper had
become riddled with tabloid journalism.

1288
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:18,920
<i>Not to mention persistent errors.</i>

1289
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:22,120
- He listed her age as 55.
- When, actually, I'm 53.

1290
01:19:22,200 --> 01:19:23,640
Fifty-three.

1291
01:19:23,720 --> 01:19:25,320
What, what about Leslie Tiller?
One of your own?

1292
01:19:25,400 --> 01:19:27,800
Her horticultural expertise helped
put Sandford on the map.

1293
01:19:27,880 --> 01:19:29,840
Oh, she was ever so good.

1294
01:19:29,920 --> 01:19:32,000
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

1295
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:35,840
But it seemed she was set on moving away.

1296
01:19:35,920 --> 01:19:39,160
We couldn't have her sharing
her green fingers with anybody else.

1297
01:19:39,240 --> 01:19:41,120
Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.

1298
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,760
If we can't have her, no one can.

1299
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:45,360
How can this be for the greater good?

1300
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,400
- ALL: The greater good.
- Shut it!

1301
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,520
These people died for no reason.
No reason whatsoever!

1302
01:19:50,600 --> 01:19:53,000
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1303
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:56,000
Hello, Nicholas.

1304
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:58,880
I was like you once.

1305
01:19:59,480 --> 01:20:02,760
I believed in the immutable word of the law.

1306
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:06,720
That is until the night Mrs Butterman
was taken from me.

1307
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:10,160
You see,
no one loved Sandford more than her.

1308
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:14,080
She was head of the Womens Institute,
chair of the floral committee.

1309
01:20:14,160 --> 01:20:16,160
When they started
the Village of the Year contest,

1310
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:19,800
she worked round the clock.
I've never seen such dedication.

1311
01:20:21,080 --> 01:20:26,200
On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival,
some travellers moved into Callahan Park.

1312
01:20:26,960 --> 01:20:30,360
Before you could say, "Gypsy scum,"
we were knee-deep in dog muck,

1313
01:20:30,440 --> 01:20:32,680
thieving kids and crusty jugglers.

1314
01:20:32,760 --> 01:20:34,440
ALL: Crusty jugglers.

1315
01:20:34,520 --> 01:20:37,480
We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.

1316
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,400
She drove her Datsun Cherry
into Sandford Gorge.

1317
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:47,400
From that moment on,
I swore that I would do her proud.

1318
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:52,040
And whatever the cost,
we would make Sandford great again.

1319
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:54,160
Sir, this doesn't make any sense.

1320
01:20:54,240 --> 01:20:57,960
The adjudicators arrive tomorrow.
We had to get everything ready.

1321
01:20:58,040 --> 01:21:00,640
Are you saying this is all about
winning the Best Village Award?

1322
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:04,280
This is the best village, Nicholas.
You've seen the people.

1323
01:21:04,360 --> 01:21:08,640
- They're happy, contented.
- They're living in a dream world.

1324
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,240
Sergeant Popwell
thought much the same as you.

1325
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,280
I'm disappointed
you can't see the bigger picture.

1326
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:15,680
Well, I'm happy to disappoint you, sir.

1327
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:17,440
And I'm afraid
you're gonna have to come with me.

1328
01:21:17,520 --> 01:21:19,520
You are all gonna have to come with me.

1329
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:23,520
No, Nicholas, I'm afraid it is you

1330
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:26,240
who is going to have to come with us.

1331
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:35,480
Danny, no.

1332
01:21:39,680 --> 01:21:41,120
Back off! Back off!

1333
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:43,360
Or I swear to God,
you'll be explaining how Danny tripped over

1334
01:21:43,440 --> 01:21:44,840
and accidentally cut off his own head.

1335
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:47,000
Come on, Nicholas.
You haven't got it in you.

1336
01:21:47,080 --> 01:21:48,360
I mean it!

1337
01:21:51,880 --> 01:21:53,080

Bang! Bang!

Stay back! Or the ginger nut gets it!

(SCREAMS)

1528
01:43:16,120 --> 01:43:18,600
You little fucker!

(SCREAMS)

1530
01:43:52,920 --> 01:43:57,040
Get out of my village!

1531
01:44:02,760 --> 01:44:05,160
It's not your village anymore.

1532
01:44:21,320 --> 01:44:23,080
- You did good, kid.
- Ta.

1533
01:44:23,160 --> 01:44:25,320
- What's your name?
- Aaron A. Aaronson.

1534
01:44:25,680 --> 01:44:27,120
Sorry?

1535
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:35,360
Angel!

1536
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:53,800
It's over, Danny.

1537
01:44:55,160 --> 01:44:56,280
It's over.

(GROANING)

1539
01:44:59,920 --> 01:45:05,000
This really hurts.

1540
01:45:05,080 --> 01:45:10,280
I'm going to need some ice-cream.

1541
01:45:10,360 --> 01:45:13,400
Yeah, well, don't worry.
There's plenty of ice-cream at the station.

1542
01:45:13,480 --> 01:45:14,600
Isn't that right, Danny?

(GUN COCKING)

1544
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:16,880
Stay back!

1545
01:45:16,960 --> 01:45:20,280
- Pack it in, Frank, you silly bastard!
- Now, now.

1546
01:45:20,600 --> 01:45:22,280
We don't want any more bloodshed.

1547
01:45:22,360 --> 01:45:25,000
Frank, this whole thing started
because you lost somebody you loved.

1548
01:45:25,080 --> 01:45:26,920
Don't expect me to believe
you'd let it end the same way.

1549
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,440
I'll tell you how this is gonna end!

(FRANK SCREAMING)

1551
01:46:10,280 --> 01:46:12,360
I feel like I should say something smart.

1552
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:15,120
You don't have to say anything at all.

1553

1554

Satisfactory conclusion
to the whole operation.

Now, my perfect Sunday would begin with...

(SKINNER GROANING)

1557
01:46:38,800 --> 01:46:40,200
CHIEF INSPECTOR:
What do you say, Nicholas?

1558
01:46:40,280 --> 01:46:42,400
We... We...
We have been trying to reach you for days.

1559
01:46:42,480 --> 01:46:45,520
- Yeah, well, I've been kind of busy.
- SERGEANT: We need you back.

1560
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:49,280
The figures have gone a little squiffy
in your absence, it has to be said.

1561
01:46:49,360 --> 01:46:50,440
Come back to London.

1562
01:46:50,520 --> 01:46:53,640
Sandford's hardly a fitting place
for such an exceptional officer.

1563
01:46:53,720 --> 01:46:56,320
Yeah, well, the thing is, sir.

1564
01:46:57,200 --> 01:46:58,920
I kind of like it here.

1565
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:02,240
Besides, we have to do
a considerable amount of paperwork.

1566
01:47:06,760 --> 01:47:07,880
(INAUDIBLE)

1567
01:47:27,400 --> 01:47:30,500
- Fuck's sake, Nick, this is gonna take ages.
- Yeah, it's gonna take all night.

1568
01:47:30,900 --> 01:47:33,400
FISHER: Well, good job
we've got the manpower, Andy?

1569
01:47:33,720 --> 01:47:37,800
Well, official vocab guidelines state
that we say "staffing", not "manpower",

1570
01:47:37,880 --> 01:47:40,440
'cause "manpower's" a bit sexist.

(ALL EXCLAIMING)

1572
01:47:42,720 --> 01:47:44,480
You don't mind a bit
of manpower do you, Doris?

1573
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:46,800
Oh, dirty bastard!

1574
01:47:48,480 --> 01:47:49,600

You cheeky fucker!

You know what you are?

1577

A bloody busybody!

Oh, God.

Hold on, Danny, just hold on.

Hold on, it's gonna be fine.
It's gonna be fine.

Just hang on, hang on!

Everything's gonna be fine.

Everything's gonna be fine.

1591
01:49:11,840 --> 01:49:13,800
Everything's gonna be just fine.
