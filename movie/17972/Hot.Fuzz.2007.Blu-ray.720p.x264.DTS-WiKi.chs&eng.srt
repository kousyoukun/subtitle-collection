You want me to get the Chief Inspector to come all the way down here?

74
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:41,310
我知道你想说什么
Now, I know what you're going to say,

75
00:04:41,393 --> 00:04:44,688
但事实是你让我们很没面子
but the fact is, you've been making us all look bad.

76
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:45,856
什么？
I'm sorry, sir?

我们当然欣赏你的付出
Of course we all appreciate your efforts,

78
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:50,069
但你让我们在拖你后腿
but you've been rather letting the side down.

79
00:04:50,152 --> 00:04:52,112
我们需要的是团队精神，尼古拉斯
It's all about being a team player, Nicholas.

80
00:04:52,196 --> 00:04:54,198
伦敦可不是你一个人的
You can't be the Sheriff of London.

81
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:56,075
如果再让你出去巡逻
If we let you carry on running round town,

82
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:59,995
我们可受不了你这样出色的表现
you'll continue to be exceptional and we can't have that.

83
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:02,456
不然就要砸自己的饭碗了
You'll put us all out of a job.

84
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,541
恕我冒犯，长官
With respect, sir.

85
00:05:04,625 --> 00:05:09,964
- 你不能就这么让人消失 - 我能的，我是督察长
- You can't just make people disappear. - Yes, I can. I'm the Chief Inspector.

86
00:05:10,673 --> 00:05:15,260
不管你怎么说，你忘了一件重要的事…
Well, however you spin this, there's one thing you haven't taken into account.

87
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:17,888
那就是“团队合作精神”
And that's what the "team" is gonna make of this.

Yes, but you were already married to the force, werert you?

We're actually supposed to call it "the service" now.

00:17:12,936 --> 00:17:14,396
证物房
Evidence room.

261
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:21,403
现在，去安第斯山玩一趟怎么样？
Now, how about a trip to the Andes?

262
00:17:21,487 --> 00:17:25,324
写不来侦探警官，和 不会写侦探巡警
Detective Sergeant Wainwright and Detective Constable Can'twright.

263
00:17:25,254 --> 00:17:26,547
(PHONE RINGING)

264
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:28,327
不用起身了
Don't get up.

265
00:17:29,536 --> 00:17:32,206
我想你一定很好奇 为什么称他们为安第斯山
I expect you're wondering why we call them the Andes.

266
00:17:32,289 --> 00:17:35,960
- 他们都叫安德鲁？（音近安第斯山） - 果然厉害啊
- They're both called Andrew? - They said you were good.

267
00:17:36,043 --> 00:17:38,712
还有，跟他们谈话就跟 登山一样费力，是吧，父亲？
Also, because talking to them is an uphill struggle, isn't it, Dad?

268
00:17:39,129 --> 00:17:41,131
- 操死你们！ - 谢谢你，丹尼
- Fuck off! - Thank you, Danny.

269

(READING)

271
00:17:47,221 --> 00:17:50,307
这里就是办事的地方
And this is where it all happens.

272
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,978
那是托尼・渔夫警官
That is Sergeant Tony Fisher.

273
00:17:54,061 --> 00:17:55,354
鲍勃・步行者警员
PC Bob Walker.

274
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:56,577
(MUMBLING)

275
00:17:56,814 --> 00:17:58,148
还有那是撒克逊
And that is Saxon.

276
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:02,903
这是多瑞丝・茅屋匠
And this is one Doris Thatcher.

277
00:18:02,987 --> 00:18:05,072
- 她是我们唯一的女警察 - 她不是女警察
- She's our only policewoman. - She's not a policewoman.

278
00:18:05,155 --> 00:18:07,366
- 是的，她是啊，我见过她的胸罩 - 她是名警务人员
- Yeah, she is. I've seen her bra. - She's a police officer.

279
00:18:07,449 --> 00:18:08,909
和是不是女性没有关系
Being a woman has nothing to do with it.

280
00:18:08,993 --> 00:18:11,078
那些我不清楚 但我还是偶尔能派得上用场的
Oh, I don't know. Comes in handy every so often.

281
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:14,915
我可以带你走走 警察局我已经转过好多次了
I could've given you the tour. I've been round the station a few times.

282
00:18:15,207 --> 00:18:16,709
楼上是什么？
And what's upstairs?

283
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:21,046
唔，看来我们有访客了
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

284
00:18:21,130 --> 00:18:23,424
尼古拉斯，这是汤姆・织布工
Nicholas, this is Tom Weaver.

285
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:27,219
[邻里监控联盟]（简称NWA） 的联络员
Civilian liaison with the Neighbourhood Watch Alliance.

286
00:18:27,303 --> 00:18:30,431
你会发现我们是很有组织性的
You'll find that we run a very tight ship here.

287
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:37,187
从这个控制中心 我能看到整个村庄的情况
From this command centre I can see what the whole village is up to.

288
00:18:38,355 --> 00:18:41,817
我必须说我非常钦佩你昨晚的工作
I must say I was rather admiring your handiwork last night.

289
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,486
很遗憾你没有对这些该死的帽子党 采取同样的行动
It's a pity you didn't do the same to those bloody hoodies.

290
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:47,197
到处闲逛，呆坐着虚度光阴
Hanging around. Loitering. Sitting.

291
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:49,700
实际上，我确实注意到喷泉上 有些小的涂鸦
Actually, I did notice some minor graffiti on the fountain.

292
00:18:49,783 --> 00:18:52,119
涂鸦？一定要处理他们，弗兰克
Graffiti? They've gotta be dealt with, Frank.

293
00:18:52,202 --> 00:18:54,455
他们还是孩子，汤姆 他们消失的
They're nippers, Tom. They'll come round.

294
00:18:54,538 --> 00:18:55,789
这提醒了我
Which reminds me,

295
00:18:55,873 --> 00:18:59,209
我们的朋友 “活雕像”周六来过这里
our friend, The Living Statue, was here on Saturday.

296
00:18:59,293 --> 00:19:04,340
11点，12点，1点，2点
11:00, 12:00, 1:00, 2:00.

297
00:19:04,423 --> 00:19:07,259
如果我们不对这些小丑 采取些严厉措施的话
If we don't come down hard on these clowns,

298
00:19:07,343 --> 00:19:11,597
- 我们的球都要被他们玩没了 - 我们会立马处理的，汤姆
- we are gonna be up to our balls in jugglers. - We'll get right onto it, Tom.

299
00:19:13,891 --> 00:19:16,268
我们要让他们觉得是他们掌控着这地方
We like to let them think they run the place.

300
00:19:16,352 --> 00:19:18,103
唔，就这些了
Well, that's that.

301
00:19:18,187 --> 00:19:20,606
你还有什么不明白的吗？
Unless there's anything you're unclear about?

302
00:19:20,689 --> 00:19:23,901
是的，长官 为什么每个人都在吃巧克力蛋糕呢？
Yes, sir. Why is everybody eating chocolate cake?

303
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:28,238
黑森林奶油蛋糕是丹尼请的 作为他的小疏忽的惩罚
The Black Forest gateau is on Danny. As punishment for his little indiscretion.

304
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:29,406
他的…
His...

305
00:19:29,490 --> 00:19:32,826
长官，我不认为醉酒驾车只是小疏忽
Sir, I don't think driving under the influence can be called a "little indiscretion."

306
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:36,080
不，蛋糕是他前周放错了头盔的惩罚
No, the gateau is for misplacing his helmet the other week.

307
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:40,125
昨晚的事故当然要严肃处理
Last night's incident will require something rather more serious.

308
00:19:40,209 --> 00:19:42,503
- 那就好 - 你喜欢吃冰淇淋吗？
- Good. - Do you like ice-cream?

309
00:19:42,586 --> 00:19:44,338
对不起，长官，我不明白
I'm sorry, sir, I don't follow.

310
00:19:44,421 --> 00:19:48,175
我说那样下个月我们就有 果仁冰激凌吃了
Let's just say that we won't be short of Chunky Monkey for the next month.

311
00:19:48,842 --> 00:19:50,010
老爸
Dad.

312
00:19:50,094 --> 00:19:53,889
既然你第一天上班，现在11点半 我说…去吃午饭吧
Now, since it's your first day and it's 11:30, I'd say that's lunch.

313
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:04,817
那么，是什么让你选择了沙福德了 天使警官？
So, what made you choose Sandford then, Sergeant Angel?

314
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,527
实际上不是我选的
It wasrt actually my choice.

315
00:20:06,610 --> 00:20:10,781
明白，明白 不是你主动来这儿教我怎么干活的
Oh, right, right, wasrt your choice to come down here and tell me how to do my job.

316
00:20:10,864 --> 00:20:12,074
教我们怎么干…
Our jobs.

317
00:20:12,004 --> 00:20:13,881
(CHATTERING INCOHERENTLY)

318
00:20:14,118 --> 00:20:15,202
是啊
ALL: Yeah.

319
00:20:16,161 --> 00:20:19,081
听着，我可以保证 我并不是来抢饭碗的
Look, I can assure you it wasrt my intention to upset the apple can't.

320
00:20:19,164 --> 00:20:22,418
是啊 我们都用盘子吃饭的，对不对？
Yeah, 'cause we all sell apples round here, don't we?

321
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:25,337
- 你爸也是，安迪 - 还会用盆
- Your dad sells apples, Andy. - And raspberries.

322
00:20:25,421 --> 00:20:28,007
我打赌你等不及 要跳进冒泡警官的棺材了
I bet you can't wait to jump into Sergeant Popwell's grave.

323
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:30,259
我不会跳进任何人的棺材
I'm not jumping into anyone's grave.

324
00:20:31,552 --> 00:20:34,888
- 你有…胡子 - 我知道
- You got a moustache. - I know.

325
00:20:35,556 --> 00:20:38,726
- 你为什么要防护背心？ - 这是必须的
- Why have you got your stab vest on? - It's a requirement.

326
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,105
也许在市里面是这样 但这里没人会想刺你的，警官
In the city maybe. Nobody's gonna stab you in here, Sergeant.

327
00:20:43,397 --> 00:20:45,399
绝对不会在这里发生
Not a member of the public anyhow.

328
00:20:47,484 --> 00:20:50,237
- 你被刺伤过吗，渔夫警官？ - 没有
- Have you been stabbed, Sergeant Fisher? - No.

329
00:20:50,321 --> 00:20:51,739
我被刺过
Well, I have.

330
00:20:51,822 --> 00:20:54,408
我向你保证刺人并不好玩
And I can assure you it is not in the least bit amusing.

331
00:20:56,076 --> 00:20:58,621
你你见过别人执行任务吗，天使警官？
Have you seen a lot of action, Sergeant Angel?

332
00:20:58,704 --> 00:21:00,623
我当时就在场，是的
I've experienced my fair share, yes.

333
00:21:00,706 --> 00:21:03,208
- 你煮过一些蠢货吗？ - 什么？
- Did you cook any fools? - Excuse me?

334
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,543
你开枪射过人吗？
Did you shoot anybody?

335
00:21:04,627 --> 00:21:07,963
他用克拉什尼科夫冲锋枪射过瘾君子
He shot a crack head with a Kalashnikov.

336
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:12,259
- 你从哪里搞来那枪的？ - 是罪犯持有克拉什尼科夫冲锋枪
- Where did you get that? - The offender had the Kalashnikov.

337
00:21:12,343 --> 00:21:13,427
他从那儿搞的？
Where'd he get that?

338
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:16,722
你应该知道乡下比城里有更多的枪吧？
You do know there are more guns in the country than there are in the city?

339
00:21:16,805 --> 00:21:19,850
所有人和他们的老母都携带武器
Everybody and their mums is packing round here.

340
00:21:20,601 --> 00:21:22,645
- 比如？ - 农夫们
- Like who? - Farmers.

341
00:21:22,728 --> 00:21:25,230
- 还有呢？ - 他们的老娘
- Who else? - Farmers's mums.

342
00:21:29,526 --> 00:21:32,321
被刺伤了是什么感觉？
What's it like being stabbed?

343
00:21:32,947 --> 00:21:36,283
是我一生中最痛的经历
It was the single most painful experience of my life.

344
00:21:36,367 --> 00:21:38,744
第二痛的呢？
What was the second most painful?

345
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:43,040
你有没有持双枪凌空射击过？

346
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:43,582
没

347
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:45,209
那有没有持一把枪凌空射击过？
You ever fired two guns whilst jumping through the air?

348
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:45,751
没
No.

349
00:21:45,876 --> 00:21:49,171
- 那你有没有高速追踪过罪犯？ - 嗯，有过
You ever fired one gun whilst jumping through the air?

350
00:21:49,171 --> 00:21:51,465
你有没有在高速追踪的同时射击？
No.

351
00:21:49,268 --> 00:21:50,269
- Ever been in a high speed pursuit? - Yes, I have.

352
00:21:51,507 --> 00:21:52,007
没
You ever fired a gun whilst in a high speed pursuit?

353
00:21:52,007 --> 00:21:53,175
只能同时进一名学生
No.

354
00:21:53,759 --> 00:21:58,055
安妮特，天使警官进了你的店
<i>AMANDA ON WALKIE-TALKIE: Annette, that Sergeant Angel's coming into your shop.</i>

355

<i>You ain't seen Bad Boys II?</i>

360
00:22:12,278 --> 00:22:14,154
- 该死的一天，哈？ - 是啊
- Hell of a day, huh? - Yeah.

361
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:15,823

你好吗，警官？
How do you do, Sergeant?

365
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:31,297
- 这是西蒙・扒皮，我想你已经见过 - 我们已经是好朋友了
- Simon Skinner, I believe you've met. - Oh, we're already firm friends.

366
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,382
啊，借过，跟我来，好吗？
Oh, please, please, come with me, will you?

367
00:22:33,465 --> 00:22:35,342
这是莱丝莉・耕种机
This is Leslie Tiller,

368
00:22:35,634 --> 00:22:39,763
正是因为她的出色园艺 才使得沙福德闻名遐迩
whose horticultural expertise has helped put Sandford on the map.

369
00:22:40,014 --> 00:22:42,349
- 她一直都很棒 - 别胡说啦！
- She's ever so good. - Oh, go on.

我听说你是个神枪手
I hear you're quite the marksman.

372
00:22:46,729 --> 00:22:49,189
也许有天你能跟我们一起打猎
Perhaps you might like to join us for a shoot one day.

373
00:22:49,273 --> 00:22:51,817
我已经有两年多没碰枪支了，收割机先生
Well, I haven't held a firearm for over two years, Mr Reaper.

374
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,527
我也希望能一直保持下去
I'd quite like to keep it that way.

375

I want to ask you, would you read a homily at Sunday Service?

379
00:23:04,288 --> 00:23:06,373
那对我来说有点太伪善了，牧师
That might be a little hypocritical of me, Reverend.

380
00:23:06,457 --> 00:23:08,709
啊，你是个无神论者？
Oh, you're an atheist?

不，我…我…

我信奉宗教自由 我只是不能完全相信教义
I'm open to the concept of religion, I'm just not entirely convinced by it.

383
00:23:13,464 --> 00:23:16,091
- 你是不可知论者？ - 我想我有种药膏可以治一下

00:31:49,438 --> 00:31:51,357
饼干也是，是吧？
Like the biscuits, isn't it?

516
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,318
- 扒皮先生… - 一切都还好吧？
- Mr Skinner... - Is everything all right?

517
00:31:54,443 --> 00:32:01,617
长官，扒皮先生不希望起诉 一名已经犯过罪的人
Well, sir, Mr Skinner feels it would be better not to prosecute an individual

518
00:31:59,378 --> 00:32:01,464
that has committed a blatant offence.

519
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,160
我来接手吧
Leave this with me.

520
00:32:03,243 --> 00:32:06,413
我一定会给大家个满意的交代
I'll make sure everyone gets their just deserts.

521
00:32:06,497 --> 00:32:08,374
哦，不！
<i>Oh, no!</i>

522
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,711
27KM/H
Twenty-seven.

523
00:32:12,795 --> 00:32:16,340
- 你看过《终极豪情》吗？ - 没
<i>- DANNY: Have you ever seen Point Break? - No.</i>

524
00:32:16,423 --> 00:32:18,759
在电影里的 他们跳过栅栏时的样子太酷了
<i>Amazing bit in Point Break where they jump over fences.</i>

525
00:32:18,842 --> 00:32:20,761
是吗？29KM/H
Is there now? Twenty-nine.

526
00:32:20,844 --> 00:32:24,848
帕特里克・ 斯韦兹刚抢银行 基努・里维斯穿过公园去追捕他
Patrick Swayze's just robbed this bank and Keanu Reeves is chasing him

527
00:32:24,932 --> 00:32:28,060
他打算朝斯韦兹开枪但他做不到 因为他太爱他了
through people's gardens, and he goes to shoot Swayze but he can't,

528
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:30,312
他朝天开了枪，他就像这样…啊~~~
'cause he loves him so much,

529
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:30,159
and he's firing his gun up in the air, he's like...

530
00:32:30,396 --> 00:32:31,814
40KM/H
Forty.

531
00:32:31,897 --> 00:32:33,691
你有没有朝天开过枪然后狂叫？
Have you ever fired your gun up in the air and gone...

532
00:32:33,774 --> 00:32:37,111
没有，我从没朝天开过枪，也没狂叫
No, I have not ever fired my gun up in the air and gone...

533
00:32:37,194 --> 00:32:38,654
30KM/H
Thirty.

534
00:32:38,737 --> 00:32:42,449
对不起，我只是有时觉得我白混了
Sorry, I... I just... I just feel like I'm missing out sometimes.

535
00:32:42,533 --> 00:32:45,536
- 我想跟你做同样的事 - 你就在做我做的事
- I wanna do what you do. - You do, do what I do.

536
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:47,413
你怎么会觉得你白混了呢？
What on earth do you think you're missing out on?

537
00:32:47,496 --> 00:32:50,958
没经历过枪战，汽车追逐战 没执行过什么任务之类的
Gun fights. Car chases. Proper action and shit.

538
00:32:51,041 --> 00:32:54,461
警察的工作不是大行动或之类的
Police work is not about proper action or shit.

539
00:32:55,254 --> 00:32:56,672
29KM/H
Twenty-nine.

540
00:32:56,755 --> 00:32:58,716
如果你有认真听 我在学校的演讲的话
If you had paid attention to me in school,

541
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:01,969
你就会知道打击犯罪 不是枪战或汽车追逐战
you'd understand that it's not all about gun fights and car chases.

542
00:33:02,803 --> 00:33:04,096
拉响警灯
Fire up the roof.

543
00:33:08,726 --> 00:33:10,436
真是太帅了
That was brilliant.

544
00:33:13,147 --> 00:33:15,649
我开得有点快了吗，长官？
Was I going a tad fast, Officer?

545
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:18,235
是啊，确实，吹牛皮先生
Yes, you were, Mr Blower.

546
00:33:18,319 --> 00:33:24,450
要知道，我们正在准备威廉姆・莎士比亚的 《罗密欧与朱丽叶》歌舞剧
Well, now, you see, we are staging a homage

547
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:25,590
<i>to William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet and I'm a little late for the dress rehearsal.</i>

548
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:25,743
我有点赶不上试装排练了
I'm playing the eponymous hero, you see.

549
00:33:25,826 --> 00:33:28,871
我扮演的是位英雄

550
00:33:29,079 --> 00:33:30,748
罗密欧，不是朱丽叶
Romeo not Juliet.

551
00:33:33,083 --> 00:33:35,836
- 你在写什么？ - 你说的每一句话
- What are you writing? - Everything you're saying.

552
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:37,338
我以后可能会用的上
I might need to refer to it later.

553
00:33:37,421 --> 00:33:41,508
长官，我是名有地位的律师 所以没必要…
Now, Officer, I am a respected solicitor so there's no need to...

554
00:33:41,717 --> 00:33:43,135
别写了，好不好？
Just stop writing, will you?

555
00:33:43,218 --> 00:33:48,432
听着，我只不过想解释 我速度“快”的原因
Look, I'm merely trying to explain why I might have exceeded the speed limit.

556
00:33:48,515 --> 00:33:52,811
你在莎士比亚的《罗密欧与朱丽叶》 歌舞剧担任男主角
You're playing the male lead in a homage to William Shakespeare's

557
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,160
<i>Romeo and Juliet and you're late for the dress rehearsal.</i>

558
00:33:52,811 --> 00:33:54,313
你快要赶不上试装排演了
You think this is sufficient reason to travel at 48 in a 30 zone?

559
00:33:54,396 --> 00:33:57,274
你觉得在限速30KM/H的道路上 开到48KM/H，这个理由充分吗？

560
00:33:57,358 --> 00:33:59,193
- 唔，我… - 无视限速
- Well, I... - To flout speed limits

561
00:33:59,276 --> 00:34:03,322
- 尤其是至人民生命于不顾 - 岂有此理
- specifically put in place to save lives. - Just, look, this is preposterous.

562
00:34:03,405 --> 00:34:07,201
- “岂有此理” - 听着，别写了！
- "Preposterous." - Look, just stop writing!

563
00:34:07,284 --> 00:34:09,453
“别写了”
"Stop writing."

564
00:34:11,163 --> 00:34:15,209
听着，你是对的，我承认错误
Look, you're right, I apologise.

565
00:34:16,627 --> 00:34:18,963
- 看见我怎么做的了吧？ - 你忽悠了他
- See what I did there? - You hypnotised him.

566
00:34:19,046 --> 00:34:20,464
不，我利用了这个
No, I used this.

567
00:34:20,547 --> 00:34:23,050
这是你所拥有的最重要的装备
This is the most important piece of equipment you will ever own.

568
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:26,011
它已经不知道救过我多少次了
This notebook has saved my skin more times than I care to mention.

569
00:34:26,095 --> 00:34:27,638
你也该考虑多用用你的那本
You should think about using yours more often.

570
00:34:27,721 --> 00:34:29,723
- 我当然在用了 - 给我看看
- I do use mine. - Show me.

571
00:34:35,145 --> 00:34:38,274
- 真是太有才了 - 你该再看看反面
- That's just extraordinary. - You should see the one on the other side.

572
00:34:44,321 --> 00:34:47,324
- 今晚干什么？ - 给我的白鹤芋浇水
- What are you up to tonight? - I have to water my Peace Lily.

573
00:34:47,408 --> 00:34:48,951
你肯定有想要做的事
Thought you might wanna do something.

574
00:34:49,034 --> 00:34:52,162
- 你到底在打什么主意？ - 不知道，去酒馆？
- What exactly were you thinking? - Don't know. Pub?

575
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:55,499
我觉得那不是个好主意，你呢？
I don't think that's a good idea. Do you?

576
00:34:58,502 --> 00:35:00,004
你们两个
You two.

577
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:04,550
吹牛皮先生给你们留了今晚 《罗密欧与朱丽叶》的票
<i>A Mr Blower left you tickets for Romeo and Juliet tonight.</i>

578
00:35:04,633 --> 00:35:06,010
说是想略表歉意
Said it was by way of an apology.

579
00:35:06,093 --> 00:35:07,636
- 是吗？ - 嗯
- Yeah? - Yeah.

580
00:35:08,053 --> 00:35:12,099
我们不能接受一名 有公务往来的人的礼物，所以…
Well, we can't accept gifts from somebody we've officially rebuked. So...

581
00:35:12,558 --> 00:35:13,767
是啊
Yeah.

582
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:16,687
尼古拉斯，还好赶上了
Nicholas. Glad I caught you.

583
00:35:16,770 --> 00:35:20,524
你们能不能今晚代表大家 出席那个演出
Wondered if you wouldn't mind representing us at the am drams tonight.

584
00:35:21,317 --> 00:35:23,527
- 当然了，长官 - 还有一张给丹尼的
- Yes, sir, of course. - And there's a spare for Danny, too.

585
00:35:23,458 --> 00:35:26,878
Yeah! Hey, come on, it might be fun.

586
00:35:25,696 --> 00:35:27,031
高兴点，或许很好看

587
00:35:28,741 --> 00:35:32,911
与迷人的死亡做永久的交易

588
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:37,207
献给我的爱人
A dateless bargain to engrossing death.

589
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:37,263
Here's to my love.

590
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:42,768
(GROANING)

591
00:35:44,145 --> 00:35:45,313
Now.

592
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,691
(GASPS)

593
00:35:50,262 --> 00:35:53,807
毒药？我要亲你的嘴唇
Poison? I'll kiss thy lips.

594
00:35:54,725 --> 00:35:57,811
还好上面还残有点毒药
Happily some poison doth yet hang on them.

595
00:36:05,333 --> 00:36:06,501
Bang!

596
00:36:07,919 --> 00:36:09,378
(ALL SINGING)

597
00:36:25,506 --> 00:36:28,759
天使警官，你好 给《沙福德公民报》讲几句话吧
<i>Sergeant Angel, hi-hi. Quick word for the Sandford Citizen.</i>

598
00:36:29,426 --> 00:36:30,719
很精彩
It was very enjoyable.

599
00:36:30,803 --> 00:36:33,055
- 警察喜爱观看年轻人的爱情故事？ - 我没这么说
- "Cop Enjoys Watching Young Lovers"? - I don't think so.

600
00:36:33,138 --> 00:36:34,765
本地警察对年轻人的自杀表示赞赏？
"Local Bobby Gives Thumbs Up To Teen Suicide"?

601
00:36:34,848 --> 00:36:36,433
那是非常不合适的
That's just grossly inappropriate.

602
00:36:37,101 --> 00:36:40,521
这次你不会写错他的名字了吧，小提姆？
You will try and spell his name correctly this time, won't you, Timothy?

603
00:36:40,604 --> 00:36:43,065
真是瞎胡闹，不是吗？
Absolute tosh, wasrt it?

604
00:36:43,357 --> 00:36:47,444
可恶的是 那些替角才是专业演员
And annoyingly, the understudies are actually professional actors.

605
00:36:47,611 --> 00:36:50,072
那边的格雷格曾在《稻草狗》 做临时演员
<i>Greg over there was an extra in Straw Dogs</i>

606
00:36:50,155 --> 00:36:52,032
谢莉曾在《嫌疑重犯》中演过死尸
<i>and Sheree portrayed a cadaver in Prime Suspect.</i>

607
00:36:52,116 --> 00:36:54,285
天使警官，你来了啊？
Sergeant Angel, you came?

608
00:36:54,368 --> 00:36:57,746
你能接受邀请真是受宠若惊
So thrilled you accepted my invitation.

609
00:36:57,830 --> 00:37:00,791
是督察要我们参加的，所以…
Well, our Inspector requested we attend. So...

610
00:37:00,874 --> 00:37:05,671
是啊，我们不能接受一名 有公务往来的人的礼物，所以…
Yeah, we can't accept gifts from someone we've officially rebuked so...

611
00:37:05,754 --> 00:37:07,089
去死吧
Jog on.

612
00:37:07,756 --> 00:37:10,968
祝贺你和吹牛皮夫人
Congratulations to you and to Mrs Blower.

613
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:18,017
啊，这不是我妻子 这是德瑞帕小姐，我的女主角
Oh, this is not my wife. This is Miss Draper. My leading lady.

614
00:37:18,392 --> 00:37:22,813
伊芙在当地村委会工作，警官 是位通晓内幕的小姐 [导演：伊芙德瑞帕的英文谐音就是“偷听者”(eavesdropper)]
Eve works in the local council, Sergeant. Quite the lady in the know.

615
00:37:22,896 --> 00:37:25,858
- 才不是呢 - 胡说
- I am not. - Nonsense.

616
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:31,655
我保证如果敲开你的头 各种各样的秘密都会跳出来
I'm sure if we bashed your head in, all sorts of secrets would come tumbling out.

617
00:37:33,824 --> 00:37:38,120
罗密欧，罗密欧 给罗密欧来一杯苦啤酒？
Romeo, Romeo, a pint of bitter for Romeo?

618
00:37:38,203 --> 00:37:40,080
欢迎你的到来，乔治，怠慢了
Thank you very much for coming, George. Excuse us.

619
00:37:40,164 --> 00:37:42,291
很荣幸，陛下
A pleasure, my liege.

620
00:37:42,374 --> 00:37:45,794
- 伊芙很漂亮，是吧？ - 她的笑真是与众不同
- Eve's nice, ain't she? - She certainly has a distinctive laugh.

621
00:37:45,878 --> 00:37:49,298
在学校时她跟我同年级 总是有关于她的绯闻
She was in my year at school. Always had a thing for her.

622
00:37:50,090 --> 00:37:52,051
很显然她跟那年长的男人有绯闻
She clearly has a thing for older men.

623
00:37:53,177 --> 00:37:55,471
什么，跟马丁・吹牛皮搞？不可能！
What, with Martin Blower? No way!

624
00:37:55,971 --> 00:37:58,641
我们才看了那所谓的 长达三小时的演出，巡警
We just sat through three hours of so-called acting, Constable,

625
00:37:58,724 --> 00:38:01,477
演得最投入的就是那吻了
their kiss was the only convincing moment in it.

626
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,228
嘿，既然你提到这点
Hey, now you come to mention it,

627
00:38:03,312 --> 00:38:05,940
我也有理由相信她对年长的人有偏好
I too have reason to believe she favours the older gent.

628
00:38:06,023 --> 00:38:07,149
真的？什么理由？
Really? How so?

629
00:38:07,232 --> 00:38:10,319
马库斯・坎特的哥哥说 他曾在鸭池旁帮他手淫到高潮
Marcus Can'ter's big brother said he'd fingered her up the duck pond.

630
00:38:13,822 --> 00:38:15,491
啊，警官
Oh, Officers.

631
00:38:15,574 --> 00:38:19,203
为我先前的行为 再次致以我最诚挚的歉意
Again let me extend my sincere apologies for earlier.

632
00:38:19,286 --> 00:38:22,665
没什么的，吹牛皮先生，小心开车
That's quite all right, Mr Blower. Drive safe.

633
00:38:27,878 --> 00:38:31,048
“小心开车”，我的天
(GROANS)

634
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:30,895
"Drive safe." Oh, my God.

635
00:38:31,131 --> 00:38:33,509
要知道那家伙才因超速 被我们处理了呢
You know that's the bloke we done for speeding earlier.

636
00:38:33,592 --> 00:38:36,512
是啊，但愿这是我们最后一次见到他
Yeah. Hopefully, that's the last we'll see of him.

637
00:38:48,857 --> 00:38:50,192
谁啊？
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

638
00:38:48,704 --> 00:38:50,039
Who is it?

639
00:38:54,780 --> 00:38:55,906
快来吧
We haven't got long.

640
00:38:57,866 --> 00:38:59,076
今宵漫漫
To us.

641
00:38:59,132 --> 00:39:01,050
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

642
00:39:01,287 --> 00:39:02,538
谁啊?
Who is it?

643
00:39:08,432 --> 00:39:09,851
(BEEPING)

644
00:39:14,425 --> 00:39:15,759
嗯？
Yeah?

645
00:39:18,637 --> 00:39:20,472
- 脱咖啡因的？ - 脱咖啡因的？
<i>...decaffeinated? - Decaffeinated?</i>

646
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:28,147
小布莱恩・利比在送报途中发现他们的
Little Brian Libby found them, out on his paper round.

647
00:39:28,939 --> 00:39:31,775
他可要做上一阵子噩梦了
Oh, he'll be having nightmares for a while.

648
00:39:32,234 --> 00:39:36,155
肯定是以某个速度撞上牌子 把头都给切掉了
Must have hit the sign at some speed. Took the whole top off.

649
00:39:36,238 --> 00:39:39,283
- 开这么靠边我头也掉了 - 靠
- I've had my top off in this lay-by. - Tits.

650
00:39:39,366 --> 00:39:45,914
最有可能是失控 从那边冲出道路然后停在这里
Most likely lost control, left the road there and then ended up here.

651
00:39:47,583 --> 00:39:51,920
那么，你们说呢？
So, what do we reckon?

652
00:39:52,713 --> 00:39:54,173
天使警官？
Sergeant Angel?

653
00:39:54,757 --> 00:39:57,593
我们应该拉上警戒线 别让公众看到现场
Well, we should get a proper cordon off, screen the remains from public view.

654
00:39:57,676 --> 00:39:59,386
在救护队到来之前封闭道路
Close down the road until the ambulance crew arrives,

655
00:39:59,470 --> 00:40:02,806
我们可以开条单行道来舒缓交通拥挤
whereupon we should open a single lane of traffic and ease congestion.

656
00:40:03,349 --> 00:40:04,683
非常好
Very good.

657
00:40:05,351 --> 00:40:06,435
照他说的做
What he said.

658
00:40:11,815 --> 00:40:13,943
- 发生了什么事，丹尼？ - 车祸
- What happened, Danny? - Car accident.

659
00:40:14,026 --> 00:40:15,778
太糟糕了
Nasty way to go.

660
00:40:16,612 --> 00:40:18,614
巡警，官方指南规定
Constable, official vocab guidelines state

661
00:40:18,697 --> 00:40:21,784
我们不再把这类事件称为“灾祸” 而称之为“冲突”
we no longer refer to these incidents as "accidents," they're now "collisions."

662
00:40:21,867 --> 00:40:22,952
明白
Right.

663
00:40:23,035 --> 00:40:29,166
“从来没有故事能比 罗密欧与朱丽叶更令人哀痛” （莎士比亚剧台词）
"For never was there a story of more woe. Than this of Juliet and her Romeo."

664
00:40:29,458 --> 00:40:33,128
- 什么？ - 马丁与伊芙，真是场悲剧
- Excuse me? - Martin and Eve. Such a tragedy.

665
00:40:33,212 --> 00:40:37,091
扒皮先生，能否告诉我你怎么 知道受害人的身份？
Mr Skinner, do you mind telling me

666
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:36,938
how you know the identity of the persons involved?

667
00:40:37,174 --> 00:40:40,636
事实就是这样 好事不出门，坏事传千里
You know how it is. News travels fast.

668
00:40:40,844 --> 00:40:44,974
<i>爱情撞上了罗密欧 一路哼着小曲</i>
<i>A love struck Romeo sings a streetsus serenade</i>

669
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:47,977
- 发生什么了，丹尼？ - 交通冲突
- What happened, Danny? - Traffic collision.

670
00:40:49,228 --> 00:40:51,146
嘿，为什么不能称之为事故呢？
Hey, why can't we say "accident" again?

671
00:40:51,230 --> 00:40:53,691
因为“事故”暗示着没人会受到谴责
Because "accident" implies there's nobody to blame.

672
00:40:55,192 --> 00:40:56,610
别小题大做了，街鼠
Put a sock in it, town mouse.

673
00:40:56,694 --> 00:41:00,447
你想在这小镇子做出大成就 他妈的滚出模范村庄
Yeah, you wanna be a big cop in a small town, fuck off up the model village.

674
00:41:00,531 --> 00:41:02,950
我只是说 事情不总是像看上去的那么简单
I'm just saying, things aren't always as simple as they look.

675
00:41:03,033 --> 00:41:04,868
绝大部分情况是
Most times they are.

676
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:07,705
先看看孵化器医生的化验结果
Let's just wait till Doctor Hatcher comes back with something,

677
00:41:07,788 --> 00:41:10,374
再跳出来射你的冲锋枪
before you go jumping the Kalashnikov.

678
00:41:10,457 --> 00:41:13,585
好吧，与此同时 你们为什么不查查马丁・吹牛皮的客户？
All right, in the meantime, why don't you check out a few of Martin Blower's clients?

679
00:41:13,669 --> 00:41:16,547
马丁・吹牛皮是村里大部分人的代理
Martin Blower represents damn near most of the village.

680
00:41:16,630 --> 00:41:18,173
你想要我们查遍整个电话簿吗？
Did you want us to go through the whole phone book?

681
00:41:18,257 --> 00:41:21,051
是啊， 先打给艾伦・艾・艾伦的儿子，好吗？ （电话簿按字母排序A-Z开始）
Yeah, or put a call into Aaron A. Aaronson, shall we?

682
00:41:21,135 --> 00:41:22,469
请别这么幼稚
Please, don't be childish.

683
00:41:22,553 --> 00:41:23,846
至少考虑去调查下马丁妻子
At least consider interviewing the widow.

684
00:41:23,929 --> 00:41:26,015
马丁・吹牛皮很明显跟伊芙・德瑞帕 有风流韵事
Martin Blower was clearly having an affair with Eve Draper.

685
00:41:26,098 --> 00:41:29,518
啊，你怎么这么确定？
Oh, and how did you establish that?

686
00:41:29,602 --> 00:41:32,354
因为我们昨晚看了那所谓的 长达三小时的演出
'Cause we sat through three hours of so-called acting last night,

687
00:41:32,438 --> 00:41:34,857
他们演得最真的就是那吻了
and the kiss was the only convincing moment in it.

688
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,026
好吧，闭嘴，大胖子
All right, pipe down, big one.

689
00:41:37,109 --> 00:41:39,653
那么，你还发现了谁的关系？ 克罗基特与黛比？
Here, what else you got, Crockett and Tubby?

690
00:41:39,737 --> 00:41:42,156
- 刹车痕 - 现在谁在幼稚了？
- Skid marks. - Now who's being childish?

691
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:44,074
车祸现场没有刹车痕
There were no skid marks at the scene.

692
00:41:44,158 --> 00:41:49,121
马丁・吹牛皮的车失控后也不踩刹车 不觉得有点奇怪吗？
Doesrt it seem a little strange that Martin Blower would lose control of his car

693
00:41:47,049 --> 00:41:48,968
and not think to apply the brakes?

694
00:41:49,747 --> 00:41:51,957
没有刹车痕，也就是说300码内
If there were no skid marks it follows

695
00:41:51,957 --> 00:41:55,044
司机与乘客都没做出举动来保命
that for 300 yards both driver and passenger did nothing to prevent their fate.

696
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:57,129
这么简单的道理不用想都知道
You don't have to be a detective to work that out!

697
00:41:57,212 --> 00:41:58,380
就是
Yeah.

698
00:41:58,464 --> 00:42:01,550
- 你们惹麻烦了吗？ - 是啊，是他们
- Are you causing trouble? - Yes, they are.

699
00:42:01,634 --> 00:42:04,845
艾尔罗伊的农场有了点小状况
Well, a spot of bother up at Ellroy Farm.

700
00:42:04,928 --> 00:42:08,432
老亚瑟・温布利剪掉了不属他的篱笆
Old Arthur Webley's been clipping hedgerows that don't belong to him.

701
00:42:08,515 --> 00:42:10,225
- 所以呢，长官？ - 就这样
- Yes, sir? - That's it.

702
00:42:11,226 --> 00:42:12,353
是的，长官？
Yes, sir.

703
00:42:18,317 --> 00:42:21,654
- 为什么要带条狗？ - 我们需要狗的主人
- Why do we need the dog? - It's not the dog we need.

704
00:42:22,585 --> 00:42:24,629
(CHATTERING INCOHERENTLY)

705
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:30,496
好了
Right.

706
00:42:30,579 --> 00:42:31,705
他说什么？
What did he say?

707
00:42:31,636 --> 00:42:33,721
(CHATTERING INCOHERENTLY)

708
00:42:37,586 --> 00:42:39,254
- 他说什么？ - 他说，不就是条分界线
- What did he say? - He said, "An 'edge is an 'edge.

709
00:42:39,338 --> 00:42:40,923
篱笆挡了他的视线，就砍掉喽
"He only chopped it down 'cause it spoilt his view.

710
00:42:41,006 --> 00:42:42,424
收割机有啥好烦？
"What's Reaper moaning about?"

711
00:42:42,508 --> 00:42:43,592
好
Right.

712
00:42:43,676 --> 00:42:45,010
我很同情你的处境，温布利先生
Look, I appreciate your position, Mr Webley,

713
00:42:45,094 --> 00:42:48,264
但你不能在不经允许的情况下 砍倒别人的篱笆
but you can't go around chopping down other people's hedges without permission.

714
00:42:50,307 --> 00:42:51,642
嗯，我想是的
"Yes, I suppose."

715
00:42:51,725 --> 00:42:52,851
谢谢
Thank you.

716
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:55,104
好的
All right.

717
00:42:56,772 --> 00:42:59,608
温布利先生，我想你有持枪证吧？
Mr Webley, I trust you have a licence for that firearm?

718
00:43:01,986 --> 00:43:03,570
他有这支枪的证
He does for this one.

719
00:43:05,322 --> 00:43:06,782
有这支的证是什么意思？
What do you mean by "this one"?

720
00:43:20,379 --> 00:43:23,048
我的老天爷！
By the power of Grey Skull.

721
00:43:23,132 --> 00:43:25,092
你从哪儿搞来这些的？
Where on earth did you get these?

722
00:43:25,175 --> 00:43:27,094
- 找到的 - 他找到的！
- Found them. - He found them!

723
00:43:27,177 --> 00:43:30,764
- 这是什么？ - 水雷
- And what is this? - Sea mine.

724
00:43:30,848 --> 00:43:32,391
水雷
Sea mine.

725
00:43:32,641 --> 00:43:35,185
温布利先生 这是件极其危险的收藏品
Well, Mr Webley, this is an extremely dangerous collection.

726
00:43:35,269 --> 00:43:36,770
没人因此受伤真是奇迹
It's a wonder nobody's been hurt before.

727
00:43:36,854 --> 00:43:38,856
这只是堆破铜烂铁
No, it's just a lot of junk.

728
00:43:39,912 --> 00:43:41,539
(CLANKING)

729
00:43:48,963 --> 00:43:50,465
(CLICKING)

730
00:43:51,035 --> 00:43:53,120
跑，跑，快跑！
ANGEL: Move, move, move!

731
00:44:09,567 --> 00:44:10,985
(COW MOOING)

732
00:44:14,099 --> 00:44:16,977
- 你什么？ - 不，貌似是枚死雷，完毕
<i>- TURNER: You what? - No, apparently it's been deactivated. Over.</i>

733
00:44:17,061 --> 00:44:19,146
没错，死了！
That's right, deactivated!

734
00:44:19,229 --> 00:44:21,148
- 不是活的 - 看上去还像阿
- It's not live. - It looks live.

735
00:44:21,231 --> 00:44:22,316
好吧
<i>All right.</i>

736
00:44:45,339 --> 00:44:47,675
今天真是大获丰收啊，黄油男巡警
That was quite an impressive haul today, Constable Butterman.

737
00:44:47,758 --> 00:44:51,178
是啊，我说也许该做些什么庆祝一下
Well, you know, I mean, maybe we should do something to celebrate.

738
00:44:51,262 --> 00:44:52,680
除非你要给你的白鹤芋浇水
Unless you gotta water your Peace Lily.

739
00:44:52,763 --> 00:44:56,183
- 你到底打什么主意？ - 我不知道，去酒馆？
- What exactly did you have in mind? - I don't know. Pub?

740
00:45:01,855 --> 00:45:03,482
就来，亲爱的
MARY: Right you are, my love.

741
00:45:03,565 --> 00:45:05,651
你好，先生们，要点什么？
Yes, sirs, what can I get you?

742
00:45:05,734 --> 00:45:07,319
请来一杯啤酒，罗伊
Pint of lager, please, Roy.

743
00:45:07,403 --> 00:45:09,029
除了酸果蔓汁你想要什么？
And what can I get you that isn't a cranberry juice?

744
00:45:09,113 --> 00:45:11,740
- 我不想喝醉 - 喝个三分醉就行了
- I don't really wanna get drunk. - You can get a little drunk.

745
00:45:11,824 --> 00:45:14,535
- 好吧，，来一杯 - 嗯，就要这样嘛
- Okay, I'll have one. - Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

746
00:45:14,868 --> 00:45:16,870
黑啤先生，你还收藏什么酒？
Mr Porter, what's your wine selection?

747
00:45:16,954 --> 00:45:20,541
啊，我们有红的，还有…
Oh, we got red or white.

748
00:45:20,958 --> 00:45:21,667
白的

749
00:45:22,793 --> 00:45:25,963
- 我还是也来一杯啤酒吧 - 好啊，罗伊
- I'll have a pint of lager, please. - Yeah, Roy.

750
00:45:31,010 --> 00:45:35,306
- 早先的事情有什么消息吗？ - 嗯，CSI什么都没发现
- Any news from earlier? - Yeah. CSI found nothing.

751
00:45:35,389 --> 00:45:39,893
孵化器医生报告称没有谋杀迹象 吹牛皮夫人有四个不在犯罪现场证明
Doctor Hatcher reported no misadventure and Mrs Blower has four alibis.

752
00:45:39,977 --> 00:45:45,941
拜托，警官 你的职责不包括调查这件事，对吧？
Now, come on, Sergeant, it's not your job to investigate this incident, is it?

753
00:45:46,734 --> 00:45:47,901
对吧？
Is it?

754
00:45:47,985 --> 00:45:50,446
当然不包括
- No, it isn't. - No, it isn't.

755
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:56,243
- 你放不下工作，对吧？ - 你的口气就像我前女友
- You don't switch off, do you? - You sound like my ex.

756
00:45:56,869 --> 00:46:00,414
- 你总是考虑得太多了 - 我就这样
- Well, you are always thinking away. - It's what I do.

757
00:46:00,497 --> 00:46:03,917
- 别误解了，我觉得很令人惊叹 - 真的？
- Don't get me wrong. I think it's amazing. - Really?

758
00:46:04,001 --> 00:46:06,629
我说你为什么想当男警察？
I mean, what made you wanna be a policeman?

759
00:46:06,712 --> 00:46:07,796
是警务人员
Officer.

760
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:10,466
你为什么想当男警务人员？
What made you wanna be a policeman-officer?

761
00:46:13,010 --> 00:46:16,430
我不记得我什么时候想当警务人员了
I don't remember a time when I didn't wanna be a police officer.

762
00:46:16,513 --> 00:46:20,267
1979的夏天之前我的理想是当青蛙克米特 （木偶剧《芝麻街》中的著名角色）
Apart from the summer of 1979 when I wanted to be Kermit the Frog.

763
00:46:21,268 --> 00:46:25,272
都是受我叔叔德里克的影响 他在伦敦警察队做警官
It all started with my Uncle Derek. He was a Sergeant in the Met.

764
00:46:25,356 --> 00:46:28,275
在5岁时他带给我辆警用踏板车
He bought me a police pedal car when I was five.

765
00:46:28,359 --> 00:46:31,195
除了睡觉，我都骑它去抓比我大1倍的孩子
I rode round in it every second I was awake.

766
00:46:31,236 --> 00:46:33,948
因为他们乱扔垃圾和随地吐痰
Arresting kids twice my size for littering and spitting.

767
00:46:34,031 --> 00:46:37,117
我小时候没少挨揍 但那没能令我退缩
I got beaten up a lot when I was young but it didn't stop me.

768
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:39,119
我想要成为德里克叔叔那样的人
I wanted to be like Uncle Derek.

769
00:46:39,203 --> 00:46:40,287
听起来他是个好人
He sounds like a good bloke.

770
00:46:40,371 --> 00:46:42,706
实际上，他因向学生兜售毒品而被捕
Actually, he was arrested for selling drugs to students.

771
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:43,916
真是个龟孙子
What a cunt.

772
00:46:43,999 --> 00:46:46,418
也许那辆车也是用赃款买的
Probably bought the pedal car with the proceeds.

773
00:46:46,502 --> 00:46:49,797
不用说我再也没骑过那辆车 把它放一边生锈了
Needless to say I never went near it again. I just let it rust.

774
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:53,634
但那在踏板车上声张正义的感觉 我永远不会忘怀
But I never forgot the clear sense of right and wrong

775
00:46:51,854 --> 00:46:53,856
that I felt at the wheel of that pedal car.

776
00:46:54,093 --> 00:46:59,181
我要证明给自己看 法律是公平正义，有益于人类的
I had to prove to myself that the law could be proper

777
00:46:56,651 --> 00:46:59,028
and righteous and for the good of humankind.

778
00:46:59,265 --> 00:47:02,893
从那刻起，我就立志当一名警务人员
It was from that moment, I was destined to be a police officer.

779
00:47:03,519 --> 00:47:05,521
- 可惜啊 - 为什么？
- Shame. - How so?

780
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:08,148
要不你就成为一个伟大的木偶了
I think you would've made a great muppet.

781
00:47:11,777 --> 00:47:14,655
那你呢？你为什么想当警务人员？
What about you? What made you wanna become a police officer?

782
00:47:15,030 --> 00:47:18,158
我不知道 反正我爸是
I don't know. Dad does it.

783
00:47:18,242 --> 00:47:22,413
我想自从老妈死后，他只想好好照看我
I think after my mum died, it's what he wanted, you know, keep me close by.

784
00:47:22,496 --> 00:47:26,500
- 介意我问一下她的死因是？ - 交通冲突
- Do you mind if I ask how she died? - Traffic collision.

785
00:47:27,293 --> 00:47:28,669
对不起
I'm sorry.

786
00:47:29,837 --> 00:47:32,047
没关系 嘿，看好了
Never mind. Hey, watch this.

787
00:47:33,382 --> 00:47:35,801
- 我的上帝！ - 啊，我的眼睛！
(SCREAMING)

788
00:47:33,229 --> 00:47:35,648
- Jesus Christ! - Oh, my eye!

789
00:47:38,721 --> 00:47:40,556
拜托，别这么沉闷了，快喝
Ta-da!

790
00:47:38,568 --> 00:47:40,403
Hey, come on, silly bollocks, get them in.

791
00:47:52,901 --> 00:47:55,696
- 777 - 扒皮先生
- 777. - Mr Skinner.

792
00:47:55,779 --> 00:47:58,365
- 你认识乔治・批发商吧？ - 晚上好，警官
- You know George Merchant, don't you? - Evening, Officer.

793
00:47:58,449 --> 00:48:01,368
我们刚刚正在谈论车祸呢
Yes, we were just discussing the accident.

794
00:48:01,452 --> 00:48:04,872
我最近才结识了马丁与伊芙
I'd come to know Martin and Eve very well of late.

795
00:48:04,955 --> 00:48:06,498
就这么去了
Such a loss.

796
00:48:06,582 --> 00:48:09,043
为了他们的死喝一杯吧？
What say we drink to their demise?

797
00:48:09,126 --> 00:48:10,669
应该是为了纪念他们喝一杯吧？
Shouldrt that be "drink to their memories"?

798
00:48:10,753 --> 00:48:13,005
当然了，干杯
Of course. Cheers.

799
00:48:13,088 --> 00:48:14,923
我要回我的小闺房了
I must go to the little boys' room.

800
00:48:16,300 --> 00:48:19,053
- 我没事！ - 他说的不完全对
- GEORGE: I'm all right! - "Little" being the operative word.

801
00:48:19,637 --> 00:48:22,222
明天才会变得更“小”
Oh, he'll be in bits tomorrow.

802
00:48:31,023 --> 00:48:33,692
我想有人得回家了
I think somebody needs to go home.

803
00:48:33,776 --> 00:48:37,571
- 我还没那么醉呢，长官 - 不是你，是他
- I'm... I'm not that drunk, sir. - Not you. Him.

804
00:48:39,657 --> 00:48:40,991
怎么了？
What?

805
00:48:42,242 --> 00:48:46,121
嘿，我们有点小醉了，你呢？
Hey, we did get a little drunk. Did you get it?

806
00:48:46,205 --> 00:48:48,916
因为他很小，所以他醉了
'Cause he's... He's little and he's drunk.

807
00:48:50,751 --> 00:48:52,670
啊，天哪！
Oh, good grief.

808
00:48:53,003 --> 00:48:55,965
与整个村庄的风格 格格不入，是吧？
It's hardly in keeping with the village's rustic aesthetic, is it?

809
00:48:57,841 --> 00:49:00,344
- 我欠你多少？ - 20磅
- How much do I owe you? - Twenty quid.

810
00:49:00,427 --> 00:49:02,429
拿去
There you go.

811
00:49:02,930 --> 00:49:05,140
- 这是你的找零 - 上帝保佑你
- And there's your change. - God bless you.

812
00:49:05,808 --> 00:49:07,059
再见
Bye-bye.

813
00:49:08,116 --> 00:49:09,575
(GEORGE EXCLAIMS)

814
00:49:10,104 --> 00:49:11,689
我没事
I'm all right.

815
00:49:14,942 --> 00:49:16,777
我明早可不想像他一样
I would not wanna be him in the morning.

816
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:30,749
唔，我家到了
Well, this is me.

817
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:35,087
那明天早上见了
Well, I shall see you in the morning.

818
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:38,048
进来喝一杯咖啡吗？
Unless you wanna come in for a cup of coffee?

819
00:49:38,132 --> 00:49:40,801
- 我不喝咖啡 - 茶呢？
- I don't drink coffee. - Tea?

820
00:49:40,884 --> 00:49:42,928
我正午后不喝含咖啡因的东西
No caffeine after midday.

821
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,556
啤酒呢？
How about another beer?

822
00:49:53,272 --> 00:49:54,440
啊，天那
Oh, dear.

823
00:50:00,779 --> 00:50:04,116
- 你什么时候搬来的？ - 大概5年前
- When did you move in? - About five years ago.

824
00:50:05,326 --> 00:50:08,037
- 你应该搞些室内绿化 - 啊，是啊
- You should get some house plants. - Oh, yeah, yeah.

825
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,956
我已经照看我的白鹤芋快三年了
Yeah. I've been tending my Peace Lily for about three years now.

826
00:50:12,541 --> 00:50:16,086
它能净化空气，有助思考，缓解压力
It oxygenates the room, helps you think, relieves stress.

827
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:18,005
需求却不大
Its needs are simple.

828
00:50:22,301 --> 00:50:25,471
珍妮常说我爱花胜过她
Janine used to say I love my Lily more than I loved her.

829
00:50:25,554 --> 00:50:27,806
- 那就是你们分手的原因？ - 什么？
- Is that why you split up? - What?

830
00:50:28,724 --> 00:50:32,144
- 因为你跟植物干那事？ - 不，不是
- 'Cause you did it with a plant? - No, no, no.

831
00:50:32,227 --> 00:50:35,773
更多的是因为我沉迷于工作
It was more about me being obsessed with the job.

832
00:50:36,065 --> 00:50:38,400
那样很好啊，不是吗？
That's good though, right?

833
00:50:38,901 --> 00:50:40,361
是吗？
Is it though?

834
00:50:40,444 --> 00:50:45,741
我错过了许多晚餐，派对 还有一到两个生日
I did miss a few dinners. You know, parties, a birthday or two.

835
00:50:45,824 --> 00:50:48,869
- 听着伙计，我… - 还有他父亲的葬礼
- Listen, mate, I... - Her dad's funeral.

836
00:50:49,995 --> 00:50:54,416
- 我只是想做好我的本职工作 - 你已经做得很好了
- I just wanna be good at what I do. - You are good at what you do.

837
00:50:56,001 --> 00:51:00,339
你只需要关掉你脑袋里的开关
You've just gotta learn to switch off that big old melon of yours.

838
00:51:02,383 --> 00:51:04,468
那正是问题所在，丹尼
That's the whole problem, Danny.

839
00:51:07,846 --> 00:51:09,848
我不知道该怎么做
I don't think I know how.

840
00:51:10,766 --> 00:51:12,768
我可以告诉你怎么办
I can show you how.

841
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:21,443
我的老天爷！
By the power of Grey Skull.

842
00:51:22,194 --> 00:51:24,613
《终极豪情》还是《绝地战警2》？
<i>Point Break or Bad Boys II?</i>

843
00:51:24,697 --> 00:51:26,031
你觉得我更适合看哪个？
Which one do you think I'll prefer?

844
00:51:26,115 --> 00:51:28,242
不，我是说你想先看哪个？
No, I mean which one do you wanna watch first?

845
00:51:28,325 --> 00:51:29,535
你耍我吗？
You are pulling my leg?

846
00:51:38,975 --> 00:51:40,393
<i>(PANTING)</i>

847
00:51:55,616 --> 00:51:57,076
<i>(SCREAMING)</i>

848
00:52:10,576 --> 00:52:12,578
你觉得怎么样？
What did you think of that?

849
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:16,665
我承认这片子很疯狂，惊险刺激
Well, I won't argue that it was a no holds barred,

850
00:52:16,665 --> 00:52:18,584
但你造成这么严重的流血冲突
adrenalin fuelled thrill ride but there's no way you could perpetrate

851
00:52:18,626 --> 00:52:22,921
是不可能避免繁重的书面报告
that amount of carnage and mayhem and not incur a considerable amount of paperwork.

852
00:52:23,005 --> 00:52:24,340
那算什么，伙计
That is nothing, man.

853
00:52:24,423 --> 00:52:26,091
这才叫火爆！
This is about to go off.

854
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:40,244
(PHONE RINGING)

855
00:52:42,191 --> 00:52:43,776
这要变成现实了
<i>This shit just got real.</i>

856
00:52:47,655 --> 00:52:49,406
真是惨啊
HATCHER: Nasty way to go.

857
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:53,494
我想批发商是想炸点东西吃 但没关煤气阀
I think our Mr Merchant tried to have a little fry up and left the gas on.

858
00:52:55,329 --> 00:53:01,126
毕生都献给了电冰箱 却被电烤炉给杀了
Spends his whole life devoted to the refrigerator

859
00:52:58,596 --> 00:53:00,973
then gets killed by an oven.

860
00:53:02,127 --> 00:53:05,422
我告诉过他多次 深更半夜就不要吃东西了
I told him several times, you shouldn't eat late at night.

861
00:53:05,506 --> 00:53:08,425
啊，我不知道 我喜欢夜宵
Oh, I don't know. I quite like a little midnight gobble.

862
00:53:08,509 --> 00:53:09,718
靠
Cocks.

863
00:53:09,802 --> 00:53:13,472
那你们怎么想，天使？
So, what do we reckon? Angel?

864
00:53:14,807 --> 00:53:15,933
帮帮我
Help me.

865
00:53:16,475 --> 00:53:20,020
好的，我们要拉起警戒线 先让消防队做完工作
Okay, we get a proper cordon up, we let the fire crews finish their stuff,

866
00:53:20,104 --> 00:53:22,856
然后我们找人来对房子进行彻底的清理
and then we get forensics in to do a thorough sweep of the house.

867
00:53:22,940 --> 00:53:25,651
非常好，照他说的做
Very good. What he said.

868
00:53:25,734 --> 00:53:27,861
天使警官，你好 讲两句话吧？
Sergeant Angel, hi-hi. A quick word?

869
00:53:27,945 --> 00:53:30,281
情报员先生，我们随后会发表声明的
Mr Messenger, a statement will be issued shortly.

870
00:53:30,364 --> 00:53:33,033
实际上，我只是想问 “你完美周日是什么样子？
Actually, I just wanted to ask, "What's your perfect Sunday?"

871
00:53:33,117 --> 00:53:35,494
我来应付媒体吧，警官
I'll deal with the press, Sergeant.

872
00:53:35,577 --> 00:53:40,541
我完美的周日是舒舒服服地躺在…
Now, my perfect Sunday is a lovely long lie in...

873
00:53:41,208 --> 00:53:45,838
<i>大火会掩盖你所做的一切</i>
<i>Fire to destroy all you've done</i>

874
00:53:50,092 --> 00:53:51,343
就跟电影里一样
Like in the films.

875
00:53:51,802 --> 00:53:54,513
是有点像，有点像《烈火雄心》
<i>MAN: Something like, something out of Backdraft.</i>

876
00:53:56,348 --> 00:53:59,643
- 你怎么看，谋杀吗？ - 也许
- What are you thinking? Foul play? - ANGEL: Maybe.

877
00:54:00,102 --> 00:54:03,689
我们想找最后见过批发商 的两个人谈谈
We're just hoping to talk to the last people to see Mr Merchant alive.

878
00:54:04,106 --> 00:54:09,194
那就是你可拉屎・擦屁股警官 和胖尼・奶油包巡警
Namely a Sergeant Knickerless Asswipe and a Constable Fanny Batterbum.

879
00:54:09,278 --> 00:54:12,197
- 是我们 - 你们觉得很搞笑吗？
- That's us. - Why is this such a big joke to you?

880
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:13,741
一周内死了三个人
Three people have died in a week.

881
00:54:13,824 --> 00:54:16,452
啊，拜托，福尔摩斯 这都是些意外
Oh, come on, Doctor Sherlock, they were accidents.

882
00:54:16,535 --> 00:54:18,037
意外天天有
People have accidents every day.

883
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:21,040
- 受害者是有关联的 - 这里的人都有关联的
- The victims knew each other. - Everyone knows everyone round here.

884
00:54:21,123 --> 00:54:24,376
是啊，只有你这个没有关联的人 才会瞎怀疑
Yeah. If you didn't see anything suspicious, then who did?

885
00:54:29,715 --> 00:54:31,634
恐怕有一点点的盲区
It's a bit of a blind spot, I'm afraid.

886
00:54:31,717 --> 00:54:33,969
我们只恰好捕捉到了爆炸边缘
We just catch the very edge of the explosion.

887
00:54:34,053 --> 00:54:35,888
太糟了
Nasty way to go.

888
00:54:35,971 --> 00:54:38,557
- 但有件东西吸引了我 - 真的吗？是什么？
- There was something took my eye. - Really? What's that?

你真的认为这是起谋杀？
Do you really think this is murder?

979
01:00:28,157 --> 01:00:29,742
我只是觉得有这个可能
I just don't think we should rule it out, that's all.

980
01:00:29,825 --> 01:00:31,327
嗯，我想你是对的

我觉得你是在放屁
I think you're talking a load of old shit.

Did you go to his house? Did you read his articles?

It's high time you realised that. You and your monkey.

992
01:01:04,109 --> 01:01:06,070
他是指我还是它？
Did he mean me or that?

993

你到底有没有听进我说的话？
Have you listened to anything that I've said?

你指什么？
What do you mean?

You said I could be an amazing policeman-officer.

1001
01:01:24,255 --> 01:01:26,674
随时都会发生状况，丹尼
There's always something going on, Danny.

1002
01:01:26,757 --> 01:01:30,386
除非你明白这点 你就成不了一名出色的警务人员
And you won't be an amazing police officer until you understand that.

1003
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:32,846
我记住了你所说的一些其他话
Well, I remembered something else you said and all.

1004
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,556
- 啊，是吗？ - 嗯
- Oh, did you now? - Yeah.

1005
01:01:34,640 --> 01:01:36,934
你不知道该如何放下工作！
You don't know how to switch off!

1006
01:01:59,915 --> 01:02:01,500
有人给了你这个

1007

1031
01:03:41,936 --> 01:03:43,687

1035
01:03:49,235 --> 01:03:50,903
- 搞婚外恋 - 很显然

- And we both know who with. - Eve Draper.

1037
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,866

1041
01:04:01,580 --> 01:04:05,668
乔治・批发商就在那儿 得到在诺里斯大道造那奇怪公寓的许可
Where George Merchant secured permission

1042
01:04:03,290 --> 01:04:05,668
to build his dubious mansion on Norris Avenue.

1043
01:04:05,751 --> 01:04:06,877
所以呢？
So...

1044
01:04:06,961 --> 01:04:09,171
或许那些真的是意外
Maybe they were all accidents. People have accidents every day.

1045
01:04:09,380 --> 01:04:11,048
意外天天都有

1046
01:04:12,383 --> 01:04:14,885
- 你们俩在做什么？ - 没什么
(MOCKING)

1047
01:04:12,383 --> 01:04:14,885

1048
01:04:14,969 --> 01:04:16,095
哦，那快看啊
Well, look sharp.

1049
01:04:16,178 --> 01:04:18,931
- 局里起火了 - 什么？

1050
01:04:19,014 --> 01:04:22,685
祝你生日快乐
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1051
01:04:22,768 --> 01:04:26,981
祝你生日快乐
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

1052
01:04:27,064 --> 01:04:30,734
- 胖子，你为什么不吭一声 - 我们不在忙嘛
- Danny, why didn't you say something? - We were working, werert we?

1053
01:04:33,112 --> 01:04:36,198
- 嘿，你去那儿？ - 一点私事
- Hey, where are you going? - Personal errand.

1054
01:04:36,907 --> 01:04:38,576
(SIREN BLARING)

1055
01:04:42,997 --> 01:04:44,415
你好啊，耕种机女士
Hello, Miss Tiller.

1056
01:04:44,498 --> 01:04:47,209
你这里有卖白鹤芋花吗？
I was wondering, do you have any Japanese Peace Lilies?

1057
01:04:47,293 --> 01:04:48,711
有，有
Of course.

1058
01:04:49,462 --> 01:04:51,922
我刚准备打烊
I was just about to pop off, actually.

1059
01:04:52,757 --> 01:04:55,050
我总找不到剪刀
I can never find my scissors.

1060
01:04:55,301 --> 01:04:59,263
- 是要送给特别的人？ - 是，是的
- Is this for someone special? - Yes. Yes, it is.

1061
01:05:01,682 --> 01:05:06,312
- 你要离开一阵吗，耕种机女士 - 是的，我要搬走了
- Are you going somewhere, Miss Tiller? - Yes. I'm moving away.

1062
01:05:07,438 --> 01:05:10,608
不介意我问一下您为什么要搬走吗？
And why the move, if you don't mind me asking?

1063
01:05:10,691 --> 01:05:15,529
- 那我只对你一个人说… - 嗯？
- Well, just between you and I... - Yes?

1064
01:05:15,738 --> 01:05:18,657
- 你知道那被炸飞的… - 乔治・批发商
- You know that fella who blew up? - George Merchant.

1065
01:05:18,741 --> 01:05:21,911
那个乔治・批发商，阿弥陀佛， 想要买这块地皮
Well, George Merchant, God rest him, wanted to buy this land,

1066
01:05:21,994 --> 01:05:25,581
他送来律师，马丁・吹牛皮 阿弥陀佛
so he sends round his legal fella, Martin Blower, God rest him,

1067
01:05:25,664 --> 01:05:27,792
我那时就同意了
and I thought I might take them up on it.

1068
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:31,587
除了娘娘腔表哥， 我在这里没什么亲戚
I haven't really got that much family round here, save for Cousin Sissy.

1069
01:05:31,670 --> 01:05:35,132
所以我就签了合同，搬去布福德・艾比
So I thought I might take them up on the offer and move to Buford Abbey.

1070
01:05:35,216 --> 01:05:37,218
要张祝贺卡片吗？
Would you like a card with this?

1071
01:05:37,384 --> 01:05:39,678
不，抱歉 你刚说那合同？
No, sorry, you were talking about the offer?

1072
01:05:39,762 --> 01:05:42,973
那个，原来那马丁・吹牛皮， 阿弥陀佛
Well, it turns out that Martin Blower, God rest him,

1073
01:05:43,057 --> 01:05:45,226
他知道这里要开一条新路
knew where the new bypass road is going

1074
01:05:45,309 --> 01:05:48,395
因为他想把伊芙・德瑞帕踢出村委会 阿弥陀佛
because he was knocking off Eve Draper from the council, God rest her,

1075
01:05:48,479 --> 01:05:52,191
还有那记者，阿弥陀佛 发现了这开道计划
and then that reporter, God rest him, finds out about the route

1076
01:05:52,274 --> 01:05:54,401
他告诉我这块地很值钱
and tells me this land's very valuable.

1077
01:05:54,485 --> 01:05:58,572
比乔治和马丁给的价要高10倍 阿弥陀佛
Ten times what George Merchant and Martin Blower, God rest them, offered me.

1078
01:05:58,656 --> 01:06:01,659
既然他们都过世了 我就决定自己来…
So, with them having passed on, I decided to sell it on myself

1079
01:06:01,742 --> 01:06:04,537
卖给马丁, 乔治和伊芙他们…
to some folks from the city that Martin, George and Eve,

1080
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:06,664
提起过的另一些生意人 阿弥陀佛
God rest the lot of them, had been talking to.

1081
01:06:06,747 --> 01:06:09,583
好像他们想造一个超级购物中心什么的
Apparently, they want to build a big shopping centre or something.

1082
01:06:09,667 --> 01:06:12,461
当然娘娘腔表哥不会愿意
Of course, Cousin Sissy won't be too happy about that,

1083
01:06:12,545 --> 01:06:14,630
但我觉得娘娘腔表哥可以去操…
but as far as I'm concerned, Cousin Sissy can go and fuck...

1084
01:06:14,713 --> 01:06:17,341
你能不能等我一下
Would you just excuse me, for just one second?

1085
01:06:32,565 --> 01:06:33,774
站住！
Stop!

1086
01:06:34,650 --> 01:06:36,277
我以法律的名义命令你！
In the name of the law!

1087
01:07:34,460 --> 01:07:36,462
慢着...慢着...
<i>Hang about, hang about.</i>

1088
01:07:37,296 --> 01:07:39,590
你说这不是意外？
You're saying this wasrt an accident?

1089
01:07:40,925 --> 01:07:42,968
莱丝莉・耕种机是操他妈被谋杀的！
Leslie Tiller was fucking murdered!

1090
01:07:43,052 --> 01:07:44,512
- 怎么，和提姆 情报员一样？ - 是的！
- What, just like Tim Messenger? - Yes!

1091
01:07:44,595 --> 01:07:45,763
- 还有乔治 批发商? - 是的！
- And George Merchant? - Yes!

1092
01:07:45,846 --> 01:07:47,098
- 伊芙・德瑞帕？ - 是的！
- And Eve Draper? - Yes!

1093
01:07:47,181 --> 01:07:48,808
- 那马丁・吹牛皮？ - 那倒不是
- And Martin Blower? - No, actually.

1094
01:07:48,891 --> 01:07:50,768
- 真的？ - 操他妈的是！
- Really? - 'Course he fucking was!

1095
01:07:50,851 --> 01:07:52,770
谢了，胖子
Thank you, Danny.

1096
01:07:52,853 --> 01:07:56,190
哦，谋杀，谋杀，谋杀 还要他妈的修改记录了
Oh, murder, murder, murder. Change the fucking record.

1097
01:07:56,774 --> 01:07:57,942
谢了，安迪
Thank you, Andy.

1098
01:07:58,025 --> 01:08:02,279
拜托，警官 你必须面对现实，这只是件意外
Come on, Sergeant, you've gotta accept it was just another nasty accident.

1099
01:08:02,363 --> 01:08:03,447
那你是什么意思？
What are you suggesting?

1100
01:08:03,531 --> 01:08:06,033
莱丝莉・耕种机跌倒在自己的剪刀上？
That Leslie Tiller tripped and fell on her own shears?

1101
01:08:06,117 --> 01:08:08,577
本・弗莱彻前几周跌倒在草耙上
Ben Fletcher fell on his pitchfork the other week.

1102
01:08:08,661 --> 01:08:12,123
就是，有意外是很正常的 你凭什么觉得这是谋杀？
Yeah, accidents happen all the time. What makes you think it was murder?

1103
01:08:12,206 --> 01:08:15,167
- 因为我就在现场！ - 那你说说…
- Because I was there! - There's a point.

1104
01:08:15,251 --> 01:08:16,627
你当时在哪儿做什么？
Why were you there?

1105
01:08:16,710 --> 01:08:20,965
我在买黄油男警员的生日礼物
I was buying Constable Butterman a Japanese Peace Lily for his birthday.

1106
01:08:21,048 --> 01:08:23,634
说什么鬼话
What absolute horseshit.

1107
01:08:23,717 --> 01:08:27,680
我追过逃离现场的疑犯 无辜的人为什么要逃跑！
I chased a suspect from the scene. Innocent people don't run!

1108
01:08:27,763 --> 01:08:30,850
或许是个惯犯，专偷仙人掌
Here, maybe it was our old friend, the cactus thief.

1109
01:08:30,933 --> 01:08:33,644
那他身上的刺还有够多的
Oh, yeah, he was a prickly customer, werert he?

1110
01:08:34,478 --> 01:08:37,189
难道是我疯了吗？
Am I going completely mad?

1111
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:40,985
或许…是疯了
Maybe you are.

1112
01:08:42,903 --> 01:08:45,656
或许…是你干的
Maybe you did it.

1113
01:08:45,739 --> 01:08:49,076
就是，你总把谋杀挂嘴上
Yeah, seeing as how you're such a big fan of murder.

1114
01:08:49,160 --> 01:08:50,578
- 我操你… - 天使警官
- What the... - Sergeant Angel?

1115
01:08:50,661 --> 01:08:53,164
什么？！长官
Yes! Sir.

1116
01:08:55,749 --> 01:08:58,627
尼古拉斯，尼古拉斯，尼古拉斯
Nicholas, Nicholas, Nicholas.

1117
01:08:58,711 --> 01:09:01,297
我该拿你怎么办
What am I going to do with you?

1118
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:05,926
- 长官，你必须知道… - 不，你必须明白
- Sir, you have to understand... - No, you have to understand.

1119
01:09:06,927 --> 01:09:10,890
一时间，队员们是无法接受你的推断
The boys here aren't used to the concepts you're bandying about.

1120
01:09:11,515 --> 01:09:14,018
“谋杀”这个推断，尼古拉斯
The "M" word, Nicholas.

1121
01:09:14,101 --> 01:09:18,314
沙福德村已经有20年没有谋杀记录了
There hasn't been a recorded murder in Sandford for 20 years.

1122
01:09:18,397 --> 01:09:20,232
但，长官，这我能肯定
But, sir, I'm certain.

1123
01:09:20,733 --> 01:09:23,986
而且我还知道是谁干的
And what's more, I know who did it.

1124
01:09:30,034 --> 01:09:31,952
请叫你们经理来
Can I see the manager, please?

1125
01:09:37,458 --> 01:09:43,422
请扒皮先生到经理室 经理室，扒皮先生
<i>Mr Skinner to the Manager's office. Manager's office. Mr Skinner.</i>

1126
01:09:44,131 --> 01:09:47,593
天使警官，有失远迎啊
Sergeant Angel. And to what do I owe this pleasure?

1127
01:09:47,676 --> 01:09:51,764
西蒙・扒皮 我以你谋杀莱丝莉・耕种机的嫌疑逮捕你
Simon Skinner, I'm arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Leslie Tiller.

1128
01:09:51,847 --> 01:09:55,309
莱丝莉・耕种机死了？怎么死的？
Leslie Tiller's dead? How?

1129
01:09:55,434 --> 01:09:57,770
她跌倒在自己的剪子上了
She tripped and fell on her own shears.

1130
01:09:57,853 --> 01:09:58,979
(GROANS)

1131
01:09:59,396 --> 01:10:02,733
我还要以你在5月1日 谋杀提姆・情报员…
I'm also arresting you on suspicion of the murder of Tim Messenger on May 1st,

1132
01:10:02,817 --> 01:10:04,443
4月29日谋杀乔治・批发商…
of George Merchant on April 29th

1133
01:10:04,527 --> 01:10:07,113
和4月28日谋杀伊芙・德瑞帕 和马丁・吹牛皮的嫌疑逮捕你
and of Eve Draper and Martin Blower on April 28th.

1134
01:10:07,196 --> 01:10:11,200
- 那我杀他们的动机是什么，警官？ - 问得好
- Why on earth would I do that, Sergeant? - I'm glad you asked.

1135
01:10:12,952 --> 01:10:21,919
我那次看到你这位只会在镇中心出现的人 驾车出现在村郊外，就起了疑心
My suspicions were first aroused when you appeared

1136
01:10:15,204 --> 01:10:17,998
<i>at the scene of the Blower-Draper death, on the outskirts of Sandford,</i>

1137
01:10:18,082 --> 01:10:21,919
<i>despite the fact you live and work in the centre of the village.</i>

1138
01:10:23,129 --> 01:10:27,466
我还记得你在歌剧结束后的发表的评论
I couldn't help but recall your comments at the theatre on the previous evening.

1139
01:10:27,716 --> 01:10:30,678
你不仅表露你知道他们的奸情
<i>When you not only indicated an awareness of the couple's affair</i>

1140
01:10:30,761 --> 01:10:32,763
还指出伊芙和村委会的关系…
<i>but also inferred that Eve's connections at the council</i>

1141
01:10:32,847 --> 01:10:35,808
可让她获取重要情报
<i>might make her privy to important information.</i>

1142
01:10:35,891 --> 01:10:38,185
你甚至还说要“砍”她的脑袋
<i>You even spoke of "bashing her head in."</i>

1143
01:10:38,269 --> 01:10:41,897
希望能打探到沙福德开道计划的内幕
Perhaps hoping you might discover the route of the proposed Sandford Bypass.

1144
01:10:41,981 --> 01:10:46,610
你已经注意到乔治・批发商看了提姆・情报员 在《沙福德公民报》上的文章后
<i>You were already suspicious that George Merchant was buying up</i>

1145
01:10:44,316 --> 01:10:46,610
a large area of land on the outskirts of Sandford,

1146
01:10:46,694 --> 01:10:49,655
开始大量收买沙福德郊外的地皮
<i>after an article Tim Messenger wrote in the Sandford Citizen.</i>

1147
01:10:49,738 --> 01:10:53,409
你知道批发商买的地皮不值几个铜板
You see, the land Merchant was buying had little value in of itself but,

1148
01:10:53,492 --> 01:10:57,413
但如果旁边开条公路的话， 就会变成…怎么说…
<i>if it became accessible by road, it would be a prime location for say,</i>

1149
01:10:57,788 --> 01:10:59,457
一个购物中心
a retail park.

1150
01:10:59,540 --> 01:11:01,542
你因为担心客人们的流失
Consumed with concern for your business

1151
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:03,669
会让生意惨淡
and potential disloyalty from fickle customers,

1152
01:11:03,753 --> 01:11:06,338
你就想先下手为强
you yourself expressed a wish to behead.

1153
01:11:06,839 --> 01:11:09,508

<i>You used a vehicle removal truck to stage the Blower-Draper death</i>

And anyway, what makes you think I could dislodge part of the church roof?

1179
01:12:35,636 --> 01:12:38,097
亦或者，制造车祸假象？
Or for that matter, stage a car crash?

It's a well known fact that the church roof is in dire need of repair.

And isn't it true that two of your own employees

Tina here is a table dancer at Flappers.

Nevertheless, you could have utilised the vehicle removal truck for your own ends.

你这些指控是站不住脚的，警官
These accusations are quite meaningless, Sergeant,

你说的没错
Well, you've got me there.

Something that placed you at the scene of the crime.

Sergeant, this is beginning to get embarrassing.

How could I possibly be in several places at once?

01:20:28,150 --> 01:20:33,447
下周六便是洗礼仪式 我们都被邀请出席
And the christening will be a week on Saturday and we're all invited.

1279
01:20:33,697 --> 01:20:36,033
- 汤姆 - 谢谢，乔伊丝
- Tom. - Thanks, Joyce.

1280
01:20:36,242 --> 01:20:39,370
现在有个好消息
Now, you'll all be delighted to hear

1281
01:20:39,453 --> 01:20:44,125
那顽固的天使警官已经上西天了
that the tenacious Sergeant Angel has been taken care of.

1282
01:20:44,208 --> 01:20:54,135
乔伊丝明天会发现他在洗手间里滑倒 扭断了脖子
Joyce will discover the Sergeant lying on the wet floor of his bathroom,

1283
01:20:49,880 --> 01:20:54,135
having slipped and tragically broken his neck.

1284
01:20:54,218 --> 01:20:56,303
那处理了那警官后…
So, with the dispatch of the Sergeant,

1285
01:20:56,387 --> 01:21:00,474
我们可以专心根除那群帽子党
we will now be able to concentrate on the eradication of our hoodie infestation.

1286
01:21:00,558 --> 01:21:01,642
没错
Quite right.

1287
01:21:01,725 --> 01:21:05,187
在那之后，我们便高枕无忧了
After which, nothing will stand in our way.

1288
01:21:05,271 --> 01:21:08,149
你错了，织布工先生
Oh, I beg to differ, Mr Weaver.

1289
01:21:08,232 --> 01:21:12,486
哎呀呀，我们有客人了
Well, well, well, I see we have visitors.

1290
01:21:12,820 --> 01:21:15,990
我是尼古拉斯・天使警官 纱福德的警务人员
Sergeant Nicholas Angel. Sandford Police Service.

1291
01:21:16,073 --> 01:21:18,826
老天，他是够顽固的
My, he is tenacious, isn't he?

1292
01:21:18,909 --> 01:21:21,787
我要以故意谋杀的嫌疑逮捕你们
I'm arresting you under suspicion of conspiracy to commit murder.

1293
01:21:21,871 --> 01:21:24,665
不要激动，警官
Oh, come, come, Sergeant.

1294
01:21:24,749 --> 01:21:26,333
你们真可耻
You should be ashamed.

1295
01:21:26,417 --> 01:21:30,004
- 妄称自己在乎社区 - 可我们真的在乎，尼古拉斯
- Calling yourself a community that cares. - Oh, but we do care, Nicholas.

1296
01:21:30,087 --> 01:21:31,839
这都是为了村庄好
It's all about the greater good.

1297
01:21:31,922 --> 01:21:33,424
为村庄好
ALL: The greater good.

1298
01:21:33,507 --> 01:21:35,009
这怎么可能是为了村庄好？
How can this be for the greater good?

1299
01:21:35,092 --> 01:21:36,635
为村庄好
ALL: The greater good.

1300
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,846
其实，我很欣赏你的那些推断，警官
You see, as much as I enjoyed your wild theories, Sergeant,

1301
01:21:38,929 --> 01:21:40,639
但事实却要简单得多
the truth is far less complex.

1302
01:21:40,723 --> 01:21:45,936
吹牛皮的死是因为他拙劣的演技
Blower's fate was simply the result of his being an appalling actor.

1303
01:21:47,438 --> 01:21:48,689
演得不好
ALL: Quite appalling.

1304
01:21:48,773 --> 01:21:50,524
你们就为这个杀了他？
You murdered him for that?

1305
01:21:51,609 --> 01:21:54,028
- 他侮辱了莎士比亚 - 什么？
- Well, he murdered Bill Shakespeare. - What?

1306
01:21:54,111 --> 01:21:57,615
拥有一个歌舞剧社团 能帮助赢得竞赛
The Dramatic Society is an important feather in our cap.

1307
01:21:57,948 --> 01:21:59,408
不能让吹牛皮坏了好事
<i>HATCHER: Couldrt let Blower jeopardise that.</i>

1308
01:21:59,492 --> 01:22:01,744
竟让两个比较专业的演员 等在后台
Not when we had two semi-professionals waiting in the wings.

1309
01:22:01,827 --> 01:22:04,413
别忘了格雷格曾是《稻草狗》的临时演员 （《稻草狗》于1971年上映）
<i>Let's not forget that Greg was an extra in Straw Dogs.</i>

1310
01:22:04,497 --> 01:22:06,373
还有谢莉在《嫌疑重犯》里扮演过死尸
<i>And Sheree played a cadaver in Prime Suspect.</i>

1311
01:22:06,457 --> 01:22:07,875
这我知道！
Yes, I know!

1312
01:22:07,958 --> 01:22:10,586
马丁根本不在乎小镇的声誉
Martin was less concerned with the reputation of the village

1313
01:22:10,669 --> 01:22:13,881
更在乎他和伊芙・德瑞帕那恶心的奸情
than he was with his sordid affair with Eve Draper.

1314
01:22:13,964 --> 01:22:15,549
所以伊芙也该死？
And so Eve deserved to die too?

1315
01:22:15,633 --> 01:22:18,052
反正她笑起来很难听
Well, she did have a very annoying laugh.

1316
01:22:18,135 --> 01:22:19,386
难听
ALL: Annoying.

1317
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:22,306
- 那么乔治・批发商呢？ - 他的房子不好看
- And, and George Merchant? - He had an awful house.

1318
01:22:22,598 --> 01:22:23,682
不好看
ALL: Awful.

1319
01:22:23,766 --> 01:22:25,434
我们劝他改建成乡村格调
We begged him in vain to make his residence

1320
01:22:25,518 --> 01:22:28,062
融入社区，但他不肯
more in keeping with the village's rustic aesthetic.

1321
01:22:29,146 --> 01:22:31,732
那，那・提姆 情报员呢？ 他哪儿不对了？
And what about Tim Messenger? What was his crime?

1322
01:22:31,816 --> 01:22:36,529
我们受不了提姆・情报员 做《沙福德公民报》编辑
<i>Tim Messenger's tenure as editor of the Sandford Citizen has been unbearable.</i>

1323
01:22:36,612 --> 01:22:40,449
在有名的报刊上发表无聊的文章
Our once great paper had become riddled with tabloid journalism.

1324
01:22:40,533 --> 01:22:42,493
更别提他别字连篇
<i>Not to mention persistent errors.</i>

1325
01:22:42,576 --> 01:22:45,830
- 还把她写成55岁 - 其实我才53岁
- He listed her age as 55. - When, actually, I'm 53.

1326
01:22:45,913 --> 01:22:47,415
53岁
Fifty-three.

1327
01:22:47,498 --> 01:22:49,166
那莱丝莉・耕种机呢？ 联盟的人也杀？
What, what about Leslie Tiller? One of your own?

1328
01:22:49,250 --> 01:22:51,752
她的园艺技术使沙福德闻名遐迩
Her horticultural expertise helped put Sandford on the map.

1329
01:22:51,836 --> 01:22:53,879
她真的太能干了
Oh, she was ever so good.

1330
01:22:53,963 --> 01:22:56,132
但莱丝莉表妹也是我们的耻辱
Cousin Leslie was a terrible shame.

1331
01:22:56,424 --> 01:23:00,136
她竟然决定要搬走
But it seemed she was set on moving away.

1332
01:23:00,219 --> 01:23:03,597
我们决不能让别人得到她的技能
We couldn't have her sharing her green fingers with anybody else.

1333
01:23:03,681 --> 01:23:05,641
特别是不信耶稣的布福德・艾比
Not least those heathens at Buford Abbey.

1334
01:23:05,724 --> 01:23:08,394
我们得不到的 别人也休想得到
If we can't have her, no one can.

1335
01:23:08,477 --> 01:23:10,062
这些不可能让村庄更好
How can this be for the greater good?

1336
01:23:10,146 --> 01:23:12,189
- 为村庄好 - 够了！
- ALL: The greater good. - Shut it!

1337
01:23:12,273 --> 01:23:15,443
这些人死得莫名 简直是莫名其妙！
These people died for no reason. No reason whatsoever!

1338
01:23:15,526 --> 01:23:18,028
哦，我可不同意
Oh, I wouldn't say that.

1339
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:21,157
你好，尼古拉斯
Hello, Nicholas.

1340
01:23:22,241 --> 01:23:24,160
我以前也和你一样
I was like you once.

1341
01:23:24,785 --> 01:23:28,205
在我失去了我爱人前
I believed in the immutable word of the law.

1342
01:23:28,497 --> 01:23:32,334
我也相信法律是公正的
That is until the night Mrs Butterman was taken from me.

1343
01:23:33,252 --> 01:23:35,921
没人比她更爱沙福德
You see, no one loved Sandford more than her.

1344
01:23:36,005 --> 01:23:40,009
她曾是妇女协会和花卉协会的主席
She was head of the Womers Institute, chair of the floral committee.

1345
01:23:40,092 --> 01:23:42,178
直到年度最佳村庄竞赛开始
When they started the Village of the Year contest,

1346
01:23:42,261 --> 01:23:45,973
她昼夜不停的工作 敬业到我无法想象的地步
she worked round the clock. I've never seen such dedication.

1347
01:23:47,308 --> 01:23:52,646
在评委抵达的那晚 几个游客闯进卡拉翰公园
On the eve of the adjudicator's arrival, some travellers moved into Callahan Park.

1348
01:23:53,439 --> 01:23:56,984
在能喊出“吉卜赛人渣”前 我们已经在没及膝盖的狗屎里了
Before you could say, "Gypsy scum," we were knee-deep in dog muck,

1349
01:23:57,067 --> 01:23:59,403
他们全是些偷鸡摸狗的孩子 和厚脸皮的骗子
thieving kids and crusty jugglers.

1350
01:23:59,487 --> 01:24:01,238
厚脸皮骗子
ALL: Crusty jugglers.

1351
01:24:01,322 --> 01:24:04,408
我们输了比赛，艾琳就疯了
We lost the title and Irene lost her mind.

1352
01:24:05,367 --> 01:24:09,538
她驾车冲出了沙福德峡谷
She drove her Datsun Cherry into Sandford Gorge.

1353
01:24:09,622 --> 01:24:14,752
从那时起，我发誓我会让她骄傲
From that moment on, I swore that I would do her proud.

1354
01:24:15,086 --> 01:24:19,590
不惜任何代价，我们会使沙福德变得更美好
And whatever the cost, we would make Sandford great again.

1355
01:24:19,924 --> 01:24:21,801
长官，我还是不明白
Sir, this doesn't make any sense.

1356
01:24:21,884 --> 01:24:25,763
评委们明天就要到了 我们必须作足准备
The adjudicators arrive tomorrow. We had to get everything ready.

1357
01:24:25,846 --> 01:24:28,557
这些都是为了赢得最佳村庄奖？
Are you saying this is all about winning the Best Village Award?

1358
01:24:28,641 --> 01:24:32,353
这里就是最好的小村，尼古拉斯 你也见到了
This is the best village, Nicholas. You've seen the people.

1359
01:24:32,436 --> 01:24:36,899
- 镇民们很幸福，很满足 - 他们住的是桃花源
- They're happy, contented. - They're living in a dream world.

1360
01:24:36,982 --> 01:24:39,610
冒泡警官当初也和你想的一样
Sergeant Popwell thought much the same as you.

1361
01:24:39,693 --> 01:24:41,737
没想到你竟是只井底之蛙
I'm disappointed you can't see the bigger picture.

1362
01:24:41,821 --> 01:24:44,240
抱歉让你失望了，长官
Well, I'm happy to disappoint you, sir.

1363
01:24:44,323 --> 01:24:46,075
但我还是要您和我去一次警署
And I'm afraid you're gonna have to come with me.

1364
01:24:46,158 --> 01:24:48,244
你们所有人都必须跟我走
You are all gonna have to come with me.

1365
01:24:48,327 --> 01:24:52,415
不，尼古拉斯 我想是你…
No, Nicholas, I'm afraid it is you

1366
01:24:52,498 --> 01:24:55,251
必须跟我们走一趟
who is going to have to come with us.

1367
01:25:03,259 --> 01:25:04,885
胖子，住手
Danny, no.

1368
01:25:09,265 --> 01:25:10,766
退下！退下！
Back off! Back off!

1369
01:25:10,850 --> 01:25:14,645
不然你们就要想象 丹尼是如何跌倒，掉了脑袋
Or I swear to God, you'll be explaining how Danny tripped over

1370
01:25:13,185 --> 01:25:14,645
and accidentally cut off his own head.

1371
01:25:14,728 --> 01:25:16,897
少来了，尼古拉斯 你没这个胆
Come on, Nicholas. You haven't got it in you.

1372
01:25:16,981 --> 01:25:18,315
我认真的！
I mean it!

1373
01:25:21,986 --> 01:25:23,237

when I distracted him with the cuddly monkey.

然后用白鹤芋砸他脑袋
And then I said, "Playtime's over," and I hit him with the Peace Lily.

Frank, this whole thing started because you lost somebody you loved.
