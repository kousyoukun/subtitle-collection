1
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,799
Garbage.

2
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:53,798
All I've been thinking about all week
is garbage. I can't stop thinking about it.

3
00:00:54,098 --> 00:00:56,496
What kind of thoughts about garbage?

4
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,596
I just... I've gotten real concerned over
what's gonna happen with all the garbage.

5
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:06,195
I mean, we've got so much of it.

6
00:01:06,397 --> 00:01:10,496
You know? I mean, we have to run out
of places to put this stuff eventually.

7
00:01:11,296 --> 00:01:17,693
The last time... I started feelin' this way
is when that barge was stranded

8
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:22,294
and, you know, it was goin' around
the island and nobody would claim it.

9
00:01:22,696 --> 00:01:25,893
- Do you remember that?
- Yes, I remember.

10
00:01:27,195 --> 00:01:30,695
Do you have any idea
what may have triggered this concern?

11
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:33,193
Yeah. Yeah.

12
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:37,293
You see, the other night
John was taking out the garbage,

13
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:40,392
and he kept spilling things
out of the container,

14
00:01:40,694 --> 00:01:43,291
and that made me...

15
00:01:43,592 --> 00:01:48,891
I started imagining, like,
a garbage can that produces garbage.

16
00:01:49,792 --> 00:01:53,592
And it doesn't stop, it keeps producing
garbage. And it keeps overflowing.

17
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:58,190
And, you know, what would you do
to try to stop something like that?

18
00:02:00,091 --> 00:02:05,189
- Ann, do you see any pattern here?
- What do you mean?

19
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,889
Well, last week we were talking about

20
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,089
your obsession with
the families of airline fatalities.

21
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:15,089
Now we're talking about your
concern over the garbage problem.

22
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:17,289
Yeah... So?

23
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:21,789
Well, if you think about it, I think
you'll see the object of your obsession

24
00:02:22,189 --> 00:02:26,688
is invariably something negative
which you have no control over.

25
00:02:28,689 --> 00:02:32,288
Yeah, but how many people do you think

26
00:02:32,488 --> 00:02:35,787
run around obsessing over
how great and how happy things are?

27
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:40,785
You know, I mean, maybe they do,
but I don't think they're in therapy.

28
00:02:42,186 --> 00:02:46,584
Anyway... bein' happy isn't all that great.

29
00:02:47,687 --> 00:02:52,784
I mean, the last time
I was really happy, I got so fat.

30
00:02:53,287 --> 00:02:55,784
I must've put on 25 pounds.

31
00:02:57,286 --> 00:02:59,984
I thought John was gonna have a stroke.

32
00:03:02,585 --> 00:03:05,683
- So, what are you worried about?
- What am I looking at here?

33
00:03:05,884 --> 00:03:08,483
- Is this a mistake?
- Depends on your point of view.

34
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:12,683
I don't think so. In fact,
I'm gonna tell you a little secret.

35
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:18,582
As soon as you get a ring on your finger,
you start getting spectacular attention

36
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:21,282
- from the opposite gender.
- That's bullshit!

37
00:03:21,482 --> 00:03:24,081
Seriously. I wish I had
Super Bowl seats for every time

38
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:28,381
some filly had come up and talked to me
without the slightest provocation.

39
00:03:28,582 --> 00:03:31,982
- It's just marvellous.
- That happened before you got married.

40
00:03:32,382 --> 00:03:34,980
No, no, no.
It never happened before I got married.

41
00:03:35,182 --> 00:03:38,582
If I'd known, I'd have bought a ring
when I was 18 and saved myself...

42
00:03:38,781 --> 00:03:40,279
Yeah, right!

43
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,479
...a lot of time and money.

44
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:44,680
No, I wish somebody'd clued me in.

45
00:03:44,881 --> 00:03:47,080
I'm tellin' you.

46
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:50,577
It's too weird.
Oh, shit, I gotta be someplace.

47
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,377
- So, racquetball Thursday, right?
- How about 7.30?

48
00:03:53,679 --> 00:03:56,477
- Yeah, fine. See you later. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

49
00:04:02,778 --> 00:04:04,977
- Yes, sir?
- Janet.

50
00:04:05,179 --> 00:04:09,977
Reschedule Kirkland for, uh, Friday, 1:30.

51
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:12,376
- Yes, sir.
- All right.

52
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:23,775
Are you still
keeping these thoughts from John?

53
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:25,876
Yeah.

54
00:04:26,176 --> 00:04:29,775
Are you afraid of his finding you silly
at thinking these things?

55
00:04:30,075 --> 00:04:32,173
No, it's not that. It's just...

56
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:34,875
- I'm really angry at him right now.
- Why?

57
00:04:35,175 --> 00:04:40,674
He invited this college friend of his to
stay at our house and didn't even ask me.

58
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:43,873
I'm gonna say yes, of course, but...

59
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:47,574
you know, it just would've
been nice to have been asked.

60
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:50,173
What upsets you about that?

61
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:55,073
I guess it makes me angry
because I can't justify bein' angry.

62
00:04:55,373 --> 00:04:58,071
It's his house. He pays the mortgage.

63
00:04:58,273 --> 00:05:02,471
Yes, but he asked you to quit your job,
and you do have housework.

64
00:05:02,873 --> 00:05:05,171
Yeah. I have housework. That's true.

65
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:10,972
This unexpected guest notwithstanding,
how are things with John?

66
00:05:11,371 --> 00:05:13,170
Oh, they're fine.

67
00:05:13,471 --> 00:05:17,671
Except for I'm going through this thing
where I don't want him to touch me, but...

68
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,168
When did you begin having this feeling?

69
00:05:21,469 --> 00:05:24,068
Well... last week.

70
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,768
I don't know, I just... I got this
really strange feelin', and... ugh...

71
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,368
just didn't want him to touch me.

72
00:05:33,769 --> 00:05:38,968
Prior to this feeling, were you
comfortable with contact with John?

73
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:41,667
Oh, yeah. Sure. Yeah.

74
00:05:43,867 --> 00:05:46,766
Except for... well...

75
00:05:47,867 --> 00:05:50,066
I've never really been that much into sex.

76
00:05:51,167 --> 00:05:54,165
I mean, I like it and everything, but...

77
00:05:55,167 --> 00:05:59,665
You know, I just don't think
it's such a big deal, and...

78
00:06:02,266 --> 00:06:04,864
I wouldn't miss it, you know, kinda thing.

79
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:12,065
But lately I've just... been kinda curious
about how things have slacked off.

80
00:06:13,165 --> 00:06:16,665
Perhaps he senses
your hesitance at being touched.

81
00:06:17,565 --> 00:06:21,464
But that's the weird thing,
because he started not touching me

82
00:06:21,663 --> 00:06:24,162
before I started feelin' like that.

83
00:06:25,264 --> 00:06:27,263
Ah.

84
00:06:27,964 --> 00:06:32,462
I mean, I'm sure he probably wishes
that I would initiate things once in a while,

85
00:06:32,763 --> 00:06:37,560
and I would, except for
it just never occurs to me, and...

86
00:06:38,862 --> 00:06:42,562
well, the few times
I have felt like it I was by myself.

87
00:06:44,462 --> 00:06:46,760
Did you do anything?

88
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:51,560
What do you mean?

89
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,660
Did you masturbate?

90
00:06:55,261 --> 00:06:56,759
Oh!

91
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,959
Oh. Oh.

92
00:07:02,861 --> 00:07:04,860
God, no.

93
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:08,058
No. Mm-mm.

94
00:07:08,259 --> 00:07:12,359
I take it from your response
that you never masturbate.

95
00:07:17,658 --> 00:07:21,457
Well... I tried once.

96
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:24,156
It just seems so stupid!

97
00:07:26,158 --> 00:07:30,656
I don't know! It just seemed like
a dumb thing to do, and...

98
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:36,655
God, and then I started worrying that my
dead grandfather was watching me, and...

99
00:07:39,156 --> 00:07:43,555
It seemed so stupid, especially when you
don't know what to do with the garbage.

100
00:07:43,955 --> 00:07:46,854
Oh, so it was recently
when you tried this?

101
00:07:48,456 --> 00:07:52,754
Oh, well, it was kind of recently,
but not... real recently.

102
00:07:57,153 --> 00:08:00,754
I am just not up to
havin' a guest in the house.

103
00:08:07,652 --> 00:08:12,150
I gotta go. I gotta go to the office.
I gotta get back to the office.

104
00:08:13,352 --> 00:08:16,652
I only get one today? Gee, how exciting.

105
00:08:17,652 --> 00:08:20,850
I already skipped one meeting.
I gotta get back.

106
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:26,550
Look, John, if you wanna leave, leave.

107
00:08:26,851 --> 00:08:31,749
My life doesn't revolve around these
little get-togethers. Don't flatter yourself.

108
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:39,648
Don't feel like you gotta treat me with
kid gloves. Tell me how you really feel.

109
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:46,649
Listen, I got a friend comin' into town,
an old friend I haven't seen in years.

110
00:08:48,149 --> 00:08:51,347
From what I can tell,
I think he's a little lost.

111
00:08:52,449 --> 00:08:55,447
I think I may have
to spend a little time with him.

112
00:08:55,748 --> 00:08:58,645
Mm-hm.
Meaning we'll have to cool it for a while?

113
00:09:01,048 --> 00:09:03,047
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

114
00:09:06,547 --> 00:09:09,046
I wish you'd quit
that bartending job of yours.

115
00:09:09,246 --> 00:09:10,944
Why?

116
00:09:11,146 --> 00:09:13,944
I hate the thought
of all those guys hittin' on you.

117
00:09:14,146 --> 00:09:17,445
I can handle it.

118
00:09:17,645 --> 00:09:19,345
I'm sure.

119
00:09:19,745 --> 00:09:23,945
Besides, the money is good,
and some of the guys are cute.

120
00:09:24,445 --> 00:09:26,843
And you are in no position to be jealous.

121
00:09:28,944 --> 00:09:31,043
Who said I was jealous?

122
00:09:31,344 --> 00:09:33,243
I did.

123
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:40,443
You know, I'd like to do it
at your house sometime.

124
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:46,142
I must admit, the idea of doin' it in my
sister's bed gives me a perverse thrill.

125
00:09:50,641 --> 00:09:56,240
I wish I could just come right out
and tell everyone Ann's a lousy lay.

126
00:09:56,642 --> 00:10:00,740
The beautiful, the popular
Ann Bishop Millaney.

127
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:08,239
- Could be risky.
- How about I just start a rumour, then?

128
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:14,040
- No, no, I mean doin' it at my house.
- Afraid of gettin' caught?

129
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:15,737
Yeah!

130
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,138
You should be.

131
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:23,439
- Can I meet this friend of yours?
- Who, Graham?

132
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,637
I gotta tell you, we were very close
many years ago, but I...

133
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:31,238
I think we're very different now.

134
00:11:01,536 --> 00:11:04,234
- Yes?
- Ann? Uh, my name is Graham Dalton.

135
00:11:04,935 --> 00:11:07,233
- Oh! Yeah, sure.
- May I use your bathroom?

136
00:11:07,634 --> 00:11:09,733
Uh-huh. Come on in.

137
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:18,231
- Where is it?
- Oh, back there to the left. I'm sorry.

138
00:11:18,533 --> 00:11:20,732
Do you like strawberries?
I brought you some.

139
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,932
Thank you. That's real sweet.

140
00:11:41,031 --> 00:11:44,229
Hi. Um, John Millaney, please.
This is his wife.

141
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:51,228
That's all right. Thank you.

142
00:11:55,128 --> 00:11:56,727
Well.

143
00:11:57,129 --> 00:11:59,028
- That was quick.
- False alarm.

144
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,228
Have a seat.

145
00:12:05,628 --> 00:12:08,227
I'm sorry, we don't let people
smoke in the house.

146
00:12:08,529 --> 00:12:12,828
- But if you'd like to, we could go outside.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. I...

147
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:15,127
I can wait. I'm...

148
00:12:17,427 --> 00:12:20,025
- Do you have any other things?
- Yes.

149
00:12:21,026 --> 00:12:24,726
Oh, you mean to bring in? No.
I do have some other things, but I don't...

150
00:12:25,027 --> 00:12:27,326
This is all I need to stay here.

151
00:12:29,326 --> 00:12:31,824
Have you ever been on television?

152
00:12:33,526 --> 00:12:35,924
Television? No, no.

153
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,524
Why?

154
00:12:39,025 --> 00:12:41,024
I was just curious.

155
00:12:44,525 --> 00:12:48,224
Graham. That's an unusual name.

156
00:12:48,624 --> 00:12:51,522
Yeah. Yeah, l, uh... I guess it is.

157
00:12:51,823 --> 00:12:55,523
My mother is a complete Anglophile.

158
00:12:56,823 --> 00:12:59,521
Anything British
makes her drool like a baby.

159
00:12:59,923 --> 00:13:03,321
So she, you know, I think she heard
the name in a movie or something.

160
00:13:03,623 --> 00:13:06,720
She's a prisoner of public television now.

161
00:13:07,022 --> 00:13:09,820
How do you like being married?

162
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:13,020
I like it just fine.

163
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:16,019
What about it do you like? I...

164
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:20,620
- I don't mean to be critical. I'm curious.
- No, no, no, no. That's OK. Uh...

165
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,118
Well... you know the cliche
about the security of it?

166
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:31,418
Well, that's true.

167
00:13:32,718 --> 00:13:35,118
And, um, we own this house.

168
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:39,217
It's a nice house. And...

169
00:13:40,718 --> 00:13:44,118
John was just made junior partner,
and I really like that.

170
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:50,016
You know, I like the fact that he's just not,
you know, freelance or whatever.

171
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:51,916
Yes.

172
00:13:56,117 --> 00:13:59,517
So, how long has it been
since you've seen John?

173
00:13:59,717 --> 00:14:01,116
- Nine years.
- Nine years?

174
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:06,515
Yeah. I was surprised he invited me
to stay here until I found a place.

175
00:14:06,816 --> 00:14:11,414
- Didn't you know him very well?
- Oh, no, I knew him very well.

176
00:14:11,715 --> 00:14:14,313
John and I...

177
00:14:14,515 --> 00:14:16,714
were very much alike.

178
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:17,914
Really?

179
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:25,313
That's kinda hard to believe.
I mean, you just seem so different now.

180
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:30,913
Yeah. Well, I would imagine
we are pretty different now.

181
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:34,811
- I'm ready to use the bathroom, finally.
- OK.

182
00:14:50,711 --> 00:14:56,809
Graham. I gotta tell you, I almost
called the cops when I saw you today.

183
00:14:57,209 --> 00:15:02,008
I thought to myself
"This couldn't possibly be the same guy

184
00:15:02,409 --> 00:15:06,309
that once held private services in
the back of the chapel on a weekly basis".

185
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:11,607
- You did that?
- Everybody has a past. That's mine, so...

186
00:15:11,909 --> 00:15:14,007
So, what's with the get-up?

187
00:15:15,009 --> 00:15:17,608
- Somebody die, or...?
- John!

188
00:15:17,808 --> 00:15:20,406
- I'm sorry. Did...? I'm sorry.
- No, no, no.

189
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:22,508
Nobody died.

190
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:26,107
- So...
- I mean...

191
00:15:26,306 --> 00:15:30,205
what do you think the Greeks'd
think of this rather sombre attire?

192
00:15:31,807 --> 00:15:33,706
I don't know.

193
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:38,105
- Dinner was very good.
- Yeah, it wasn't bad, honey.

194
00:15:38,407 --> 00:15:44,005
Usually Ann achieves a kinda critical
mass with the salt, but, uh, tonight was...

195
00:15:44,305 --> 00:15:48,205
I always tell her, you can always
add more, but you can't take it away.

196
00:15:48,505 --> 00:15:51,103
Yeah, you say that, don't you?

197
00:15:52,105 --> 00:15:54,604
- So, do you have family here?
- Mm.

198
00:15:54,804 --> 00:15:57,203
Mother, father, my sister.

199
00:15:58,104 --> 00:16:00,802
- Sister older or younger?
- Younger.

200
00:16:03,404 --> 00:16:05,402
Are you close?

201
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:09,602
I'm sorry. I'm... I'm prying again. I'm sorry.

202
00:16:10,003 --> 00:16:12,102
Were you prying before?

203
00:16:12,402 --> 00:16:14,601
I was grilling Ann about your marriage.

204
00:16:14,803 --> 00:16:18,101
- How'd it go?
- Well, I... Very well. Uh...

205
00:16:21,803 --> 00:16:24,401
So, I was asking about your sister.

206
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:26,800
Yeah. Well...

207
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,898
We get along all right, it's just that, uh...

208
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,000
Well, I think she's an extrovert.

209
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,999
I just think she's loud.
She probably wouldn't agree.

210
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:47,098
No, I mean, definitely wouldn't agree.

211
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:52,898
So, listen, are you gonna
see Elizabeth while you're here?

212
00:16:53,098 --> 00:16:54,798
Uh... I don't know.

213
00:16:56,698 --> 00:16:59,396
- Who's Elizabeth?
- A girl Graham dated in school.

214
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:02,096
Well after the chapel episodes.

215
00:17:03,097 --> 00:17:06,497
She still lives here,
to the best of my knowledge.

216
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:12,295
So Graham and I
were talking about apartments,

217
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:16,795
and I told him that they've got lovely
little apartments in the Garden District.

218
00:17:17,197 --> 00:17:21,994
- And they got nice garage apartments...
- There's critical crime in that district.

219
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:25,093
- Oh, John, come on, that is not true.
- No. There are...

220
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:29,793
I don't know what kind of place you're
lookin' for. There's plenty of apartments...

221
00:17:29,996 --> 00:17:32,694
- ...in any one place.
- I'm sorry?

222
00:17:33,295 --> 00:17:39,493
No, I just... Right now I have one key,
you know, everything I own is in the car.

223
00:17:39,893 --> 00:17:42,892
I like that.
If I get an apartment, that's two keys.

224
00:17:43,194 --> 00:17:48,092
If I get a job, you know, I might have
to open or close. That's more keys.

225
00:17:48,392 --> 00:17:53,591
I buy some stuff, I'm afraid it's gonna
get ripped off, and I get more keys.

226
00:17:53,893 --> 00:17:58,291
- I just like having the one key. It's clean.
- You don't have to worry about losin' 'em.

227
00:17:58,691 --> 00:18:01,789
Get rid of the car when you get
the apartment. Still one key.

228
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:07,089
I like having the car. You know?
The car's important. You gotta be mobile.

229
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:10,189
In case you have
to leave someplace in a hurry?

230
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,988
Yeah, or go someplace in a hurry.

231
00:18:14,789 --> 00:18:16,988
Excuse me.

232
00:18:21,789 --> 00:18:24,787
- Do you want some help?
- No, no, really, I'm fine.

233
00:18:25,089 --> 00:18:27,288
There's not that much to do.

234
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:33,686
Graham, do you pay taxes?

235
00:18:34,587 --> 00:18:37,987
Yeah, I pay taxes.
Yeah, I pay taxes. What do you mean?

236
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:41,486
You don't pay taxes, you're a liar.
I'm not a liar.

237
00:18:42,687 --> 00:18:46,087
Liars are the second-lowest form
of human being on the planet.

238
00:18:46,386 --> 00:18:48,885
- What's the first?
- Lawyers.

239
00:18:49,386 --> 00:18:51,485
Oh. That's you, honey.

240
00:18:56,085 --> 00:18:58,884
Annie, why don't you go with Graham
to hunt for apartments?

241
00:18:59,086 --> 00:19:01,284
Show him how the city's changed.

242
00:19:01,486 --> 00:19:03,685
- Would you mind, Graham?
- No, I'd love that.

243
00:19:03,985 --> 00:19:07,685
- I'd like that, too. Let's do that.
- All right. How about tomorrow?

244
00:19:07,985 --> 00:19:09,984
- That'd be great.
- Good.

245
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:14,182
One key, huh?

246
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:16,782
Great idea.

247
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:29,382
- Yeah.
- Cynthia, John.

248
00:19:29,782 --> 00:19:32,381
Meet me at my house in exactly one hour.

249
00:19:32,682 --> 00:19:34,881
You are scum.

250
00:19:35,182 --> 00:19:37,081
I'll be there.

251
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,879
As you can see,
there's plenty of room for two.

252
00:19:47,681 --> 00:19:49,880
No, it'll just be me.

253
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,479
- Are you a student?
- No.

254
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:56,479
You can hang
a shower curtain in the bath.

255
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,578
Make sure you put somethin'
in the tub so you won't fall.

256
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,679
You said about 350?

257
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,178
Yeah. And, uh, plus
the first and the last months' rent.

258
00:20:11,478 --> 00:20:15,177
- All right. Will you lease month to month?
- Not for 350.

259
00:20:16,078 --> 00:20:17,977
How about 400?

260
00:20:23,777 --> 00:20:26,075
I could live with that. I could live with that.

261
00:20:26,277 --> 00:20:27,975
- OK. It's a deal.
- All right.

262
00:20:28,276 --> 00:20:30,175
- Ready?
- Yeah.

263
00:20:42,075 --> 00:20:43,975
- John?
- In here.

264
00:20:59,473 --> 00:21:01,871
Well, ain't you a picture?

265
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,968
Well, do you like it?

266
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:37,367
It's lovely. Is it for me?

267
00:21:40,068 --> 00:21:42,168
Yeah, it's for you.

268
00:22:05,366 --> 00:22:07,764
Is that for me?

269
00:22:07,966 --> 00:22:10,064
Yeah, that's for you.

270
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:33,762
You're amazing, dear.

271
00:22:45,662 --> 00:22:48,360
Can I tell you something personal?

272
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,760
It's up to you.
Can I tell you something personal?

273
00:22:53,961 --> 00:22:55,960
Yeah. Yeah.

274
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,358
Well, you gotta go first.

275
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,359
OK.

276
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:13,258
I think that, um...

277
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:15,758
I think that sex is overrated.

278
00:23:16,059 --> 00:23:19,358
I think that people place
far too much importance on it.

279
00:23:19,659 --> 00:23:23,658
And I think that stuff about women
wantin' it just as bad as men is crap.

280
00:23:23,957 --> 00:23:29,055
I think they want it, I just don't think they
want it for the reason men think they do.

281
00:23:31,157 --> 00:23:33,555
I'm getting confused.

282
00:23:33,757 --> 00:23:36,055
- Do you understand what I'm...?
- Yeah.

283
00:23:36,256 --> 00:23:38,854
Yeah. Yeah.

284
00:23:39,056 --> 00:23:43,055
Yeah, I remember reading somewhere

285
00:23:43,456 --> 00:23:48,654
that men learn to love
the person that they're attracted to,

286
00:23:49,954 --> 00:23:55,153
and that women become more and more
attracted to the person that they love.

287
00:23:57,454 --> 00:24:00,353
God, that's... that's beautiful.

288
00:24:01,454 --> 00:24:05,153
That's really beautiful. I like that.

289
00:24:05,454 --> 00:24:07,453
Oh, I'm just quoting.

290
00:24:08,954 --> 00:24:11,352
So, are you gonna
tell me something personal?

291
00:24:11,653 --> 00:24:14,351
- Do you want me to?
- Yeah. Yeah, I do.

292
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:17,451
I don't want it to be
something gross, about some scar.

293
00:24:17,753 --> 00:24:20,951
I want it to be something
really personal, about yourself.

294
00:24:21,253 --> 00:24:23,251
All right. OK.

295
00:24:23,751 --> 00:24:26,450
- I'm impotent.
- You're what?

296
00:24:27,751 --> 00:24:31,050
- Impotent.
- You are?

297
00:24:32,650 --> 00:24:35,748
Yeah. I mean, like, well, I can't...

298
00:24:36,551 --> 00:24:41,050
I can't get an erection...
in the presence of another person.

299
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,448
So, for all practical purposes,
I'm impotent.

300
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,548
Does that bother you?

301
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:55,946
No.

302
00:24:57,648 --> 00:25:00,346
Does it make you feel self-conscious?

303
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:12,646
Not usually.

304
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,045
No. Uh...

305
00:25:16,346 --> 00:25:18,446
Yeah, I'm self-conscious.

306
00:25:19,646 --> 00:25:22,945
Not in the same way
that you are, though.

307
00:25:23,445 --> 00:25:26,845
- Me? Me? You think I'm self-conscious?
- Well...

308
00:25:29,446 --> 00:25:34,044
I been watching you. I watch you eat,
you know, I watch you speak,

309
00:25:35,744 --> 00:25:39,843
watch you move, and I see somebody

310
00:25:40,144 --> 00:25:44,542
who is extremely aware
of people looking at you.

311
00:25:48,344 --> 00:25:50,941
- My therapist...
- You're in therapy?

312
00:25:51,242 --> 00:25:53,242
Aren't you?

313
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:56,342
No. I... No, I'm not.

314
00:25:58,742 --> 00:26:01,340
I was a miserable failure in therapy.

315
00:26:02,241 --> 00:26:07,239
- So you don't believe in therapy?
- No, I believe in it for some people.

316
00:26:08,241 --> 00:26:11,239
I don't know, it was,
you know, silly for me.

317
00:26:12,241 --> 00:26:14,340
I was confused going in.

318
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,538
So I just formed my own theory

319
00:26:18,739 --> 00:26:21,438
that you should never take advice

320
00:26:21,739 --> 00:26:24,937
from someone
that doesn't know you intimately.

321
00:26:25,939 --> 00:26:29,237
Well, I know my therapist intimately.

322
00:26:32,138 --> 00:26:35,437
- You've had sex with your therapist?
- No!

323
00:26:35,637 --> 00:26:39,636
- No. No.
- Oh, no, I'm sorry. That's what I meant.

324
00:26:39,938 --> 00:26:42,636
Somebody you've had sex with.

325
00:26:42,837 --> 00:26:44,435
Oh.

326
00:26:50,237 --> 00:26:53,235
I'm... I don't understand.

327
00:26:53,537 --> 00:26:57,136
I mean, how would you know?

328
00:26:58,535 --> 00:27:03,234
- I mean, you know. How...?
- Oh, no. I wasn't always impotent.

329
00:27:04,135 --> 00:27:06,633
Oh. Oh, OK.

330
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:11,935
So, let me see. You said, um...

331
00:27:12,634 --> 00:27:15,934
you said that I should never take advice

332
00:27:16,334 --> 00:27:19,833
from someone that
I haven't had sex with, right?

333
00:27:20,333 --> 00:27:22,031
- Basically.
- Right.

334
00:27:22,133 --> 00:27:24,631
And, uh, we haven't had sex.

335
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:27,833
- Right?
- No.

336
00:27:28,633 --> 00:27:33,231
So I guess from your own advice,
I shouldn't take your advice.

337
00:27:34,131 --> 00:27:36,730
- I wouldn't.
- You wouldn't? OK.

338
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:41,530
All right.

339
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,830
- Drive safely.
- Yeah, right.

340
00:29:11,321 --> 00:29:14,419
- How was your weekend?
- It was OK.

341
00:29:17,521 --> 00:29:22,120
- Did you confront John about the visitor?
- The visitor?

342
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:25,419
The friend of John's
that was staying at your house.

343
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:28,019
- Graham.
- Graham.

344
00:29:28,321 --> 00:29:32,519
Yeah. I mean... no.

345
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,818
That actually
turned out to be interesting.

346
00:29:38,619 --> 00:29:41,918
You know, I was expecting him
to be just like John.

347
00:29:42,218 --> 00:29:45,718
You know, cos they went
to school together and everything.

348
00:29:45,918 --> 00:29:51,416
You know, talking about getting drunk
together and secret handshakes and...

349
00:29:57,017 --> 00:30:01,815
He turned out to be
really this... character.

350
00:30:04,316 --> 00:30:07,115
He's kind of arty.

351
00:30:07,316 --> 00:30:09,316
But OK.

352
00:30:09,515 --> 00:30:11,914
Is he still at your house?

353
00:30:12,215 --> 00:30:15,313
No. No. No. He's gone.

354
00:30:17,616 --> 00:30:20,113
So where's he from?

355
00:30:20,415 --> 00:30:25,614
I don't know. He, uh, used to live
in New York and Philadelphia.

356
00:30:26,815 --> 00:30:29,013
I think he just kinda travels around.

357
00:30:29,313 --> 00:30:33,013
Must be nice.
So, what's he like? Is he like John?

358
00:30:33,313 --> 00:30:36,813
No. I don't think John likes him any more.

359
00:30:38,713 --> 00:30:41,211
Says he thinks he's gotten kinda strange.

360
00:30:41,513 --> 00:30:43,512
Is he? Strange, I mean?

361
00:30:44,512 --> 00:30:48,610
No. I mean, if I saw him
on the street I might think so,

362
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:52,209
but after talkin' to him,
I'd just say he's kinda unusual.

363
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:56,110
Mm-hm. So, what's he look like?

364
00:30:56,311 --> 00:30:58,210
Why?

365
00:30:58,511 --> 00:31:01,609
- I just wanna know, is all.
- Why, so you can go after him?

366
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:04,908
Jesus, Ann, get a life.
I just asked what he looked like.

367
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:11,109
Besides, even if I decide
to fuck his brains out,

368
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:13,707
what business is that of yours?

369
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:16,308
- Why do you have to say that?
- Say what?

370
00:31:16,509 --> 00:31:19,007
You know what.
You say it just to irritate me.

371
00:31:19,409 --> 00:31:21,907
I say it because it's descriptive.

372
00:31:23,208 --> 00:31:26,708
He doesn't strike me as a person
who would go in for that kinda thing.

373
00:31:27,107 --> 00:31:30,505
- Ann, you always underestimate me.
- I wonder why.

374
00:31:33,906 --> 00:31:38,505
I think you're afraid to put us in the same
room. You're afraid he'd be drawn to me.

375
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:41,904
Really, Cynthia,
I don't think he's your type.

376
00:31:45,406 --> 00:31:48,404
My type?
How would you know what my type is?

377
00:31:48,706 --> 00:31:51,204
Oh, I have a pretty good idea.

378
00:31:52,904 --> 00:31:55,103
Ann, you don't have a clue.

379
00:31:56,105 --> 00:31:58,903
Look, I don't even know
why we're discussin' this.

380
00:31:59,104 --> 00:32:02,102
I mean, I'll just go over
and call him myself.

381
00:32:03,204 --> 00:32:06,001
He doesn't have a phone.

382
00:32:06,203 --> 00:32:08,602
Well, I'll call him when he does.

383
00:32:09,903 --> 00:32:11,901
He won't.

384
00:32:12,103 --> 00:32:14,102
What are you talkin' about?

385
00:32:14,403 --> 00:32:17,501
He doesn't like to talk on the phone.
He's not getting a phone.

386
00:32:17,803 --> 00:32:19,801
Oh, please.

387
00:32:20,903 --> 00:32:24,702
OK, so give me the Zen master's address.
I'll think of a reason to stop by.

388
00:32:26,801 --> 00:32:29,400
Please, just let me talk to him first.

389
00:32:29,601 --> 00:32:33,700
Why? Just gimme the address.
You won't even have to be involved.

390
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:49,399
I don't feel right just giving you the
address so you can go over there and...

391
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,998
- And what?
- Do whatever it is you do.

392
00:32:53,199 --> 00:32:55,998
"Do whatever it is you do"?
Listen to the way you talk.

393
00:32:56,298 --> 00:33:00,398
- I talk fine.
- Thank you, I was still smoking that.

394
00:33:02,497 --> 00:33:04,696
What'd you lose?

395
00:33:04,997 --> 00:33:07,895
That goddamn pearl earring.

396
00:33:09,597 --> 00:33:12,095
It cost me a fucking fortune.

397
00:33:12,298 --> 00:33:14,397
I must've left it somewhere.

398
00:33:16,197 --> 00:33:19,194
So, what are you
gettin' Momma for her birthday?

399
00:33:19,496 --> 00:33:21,795
I don't know.
I'll get her a card or somethin'.

400
00:33:22,096 --> 00:33:25,293
- A card for her 50th birthday?
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?

401
00:33:25,496 --> 00:33:29,194
Well, the woman gave birth to you.
I think you might be givin' her...

402
00:33:29,495 --> 00:33:31,494
Will you stop? Jesus.

403
00:33:31,795 --> 00:33:35,094
- I just thought that, you know, maybe...
- OK, Ann. OK.

404
00:33:36,095 --> 00:33:38,093
How about this?

405
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:42,793
You get her something nice,
and I'll pay for half.

406
00:33:43,094 --> 00:33:45,692
- All right?
- Fine. Fine.

407
00:33:46,493 --> 00:33:50,493
Fine. OK. Now, if you'll pardon me,
I have to go to work.

408
00:33:57,292 --> 00:34:02,590
What is the most unusual
location you've ever masturbated in?

409
00:34:04,691 --> 00:34:06,189
Well...

410
00:34:07,692 --> 00:34:09,090
I, um...

411
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:15,189
One time I was flying from
Los Angeles to, um, to New York.

412
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:21,989
And I was... You know,
it was a really crowded flight and I was...

413
00:34:23,089 --> 00:34:27,188
I was sitting in the middle.
I didn't get a window, I didn't get an aisle.

414
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:30,788
It was really funny,
and I was... I was just bored.

415
00:34:30,989 --> 00:34:35,188
My magazines were just boring.
I think I had, like, a woman's magazine.

416
00:34:35,488 --> 00:34:40,086
And they touch on a lot of sexual issues
and stuff. And I was thinking to myself

417
00:34:40,487 --> 00:34:46,486
"God, that's what I need. I need a little...
something to take my mind off this trip."

418
00:34:47,187 --> 00:34:52,785
So, I was just, you know,
just thinking away, and then I just...

419
00:34:53,686 --> 00:34:56,684
I just did it on the plane.
Just between these two people.

420
00:34:56,887 --> 00:34:58,985
- Nobody knew.

421
00:35:03,086 --> 00:35:06,984
How were you able
to not betray what was going on

422
00:35:07,384 --> 00:35:09,484
to the people around you?

423
00:35:10,784 --> 00:35:15,383
Well, you know,
I have really strong muscles.

424
00:35:16,784 --> 00:35:18,782
It's open!

425
00:35:19,484 --> 00:35:22,282
- Hi!
- Hello, Ann.

426
00:35:22,484 --> 00:35:24,982
- I hope I'm not botherin' you.
- No, no.

427
00:35:25,182 --> 00:35:29,881
- I would've phoned. You busy?
- No, no. I can finish later.

428
00:35:30,282 --> 00:35:34,081
I just wanted to see what
the apartment looked like with furniture.

429
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:37,480
Yeah, well, I'm afraid
there's not much to see.

430
00:35:37,781 --> 00:35:41,680
I'm sort of cultivating
this minimalist vibe.

431
00:35:43,181 --> 00:35:46,681
- You could use a bookshelf.
- Yeah? Yeah, you think so?

432
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:51,680
They're... you know,
they're all library books.

433
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:58,680
- What are these?
- Uh, those are videotapes.

434
00:35:58,879 --> 00:36:01,678
I can see that. Of what?

435
00:36:03,178 --> 00:36:07,177
It's a personal project
I've been workin' on.

436
00:36:07,578 --> 00:36:10,077
What kind of personal project?

437
00:36:11,879 --> 00:36:14,777
- What?
- What kind of personal project?

438
00:36:17,377 --> 00:36:22,276
Uh, a personal project
like anyone else's personal project.

439
00:36:22,577 --> 00:36:26,076
Mine's just a little more...
personal, I guess.

440
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,276
Who's Donna?

441
00:36:30,576 --> 00:36:33,974
- What?
- Donna. It says "Donna" here on the tape.

442
00:36:34,276 --> 00:36:37,975
Donna was a girl I knew in Florida.

443
00:36:38,275 --> 00:36:40,474
Oh, you went out with her?

444
00:36:42,775 --> 00:36:45,073
No, not really.

445
00:36:45,274 --> 00:36:48,973
Why do these tapes
all have women's names on 'em?

446
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:54,772
Well, I enjoy interviewing
women more than men.

447
00:36:57,174 --> 00:36:59,572
- It's iced tea.
- Thanks.

448
00:36:59,874 --> 00:37:03,574
- I'm sorry, do you want some lemon?
- No, this is perfect.

449
00:37:03,873 --> 00:37:07,573
So, all of these are... are interviews, huh?

450
00:37:07,872 --> 00:37:10,470
- Uh, yes.
- Can we watch one?

451
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:14,770
No, I'd... No.

452
00:37:14,871 --> 00:37:16,870
Why not?

453
00:37:18,871 --> 00:37:21,769
Well, I promised each of the subjects

454
00:37:21,970 --> 00:37:25,469
that no one would
see the videotapes except for me.

455
00:37:28,169 --> 00:37:30,768
What are the interviews about?

456
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:35,069
The interviews are about sex.

457
00:37:37,269 --> 00:37:38,867
Sex?

458
00:37:41,469 --> 00:37:43,067
What about sex?

459
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:49,266
Uh, everything about sex.

460
00:37:50,767 --> 00:37:52,365
Like what?

461
00:37:54,867 --> 00:37:57,665
What they've done, what they do,

462
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:03,365
what they want to do but are afraid to ask
for, what they wouldn't do even if asked.

463
00:38:05,966 --> 00:38:08,465
Anything I can think of. Oh, your ice.

464
00:38:13,865 --> 00:38:17,265
- You just ask them questions?
- Yes.

465
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:22,663
And they answer 'em?

466
00:38:22,864 --> 00:38:25,362
Yeah. Uh...

467
00:38:25,565 --> 00:38:27,863
Mostly. Sometimes they do things.

468
00:38:28,264 --> 00:38:33,162
- To you?
- No, uh... for the camera.

469
00:38:34,863 --> 00:38:38,462
- Graham, this is just so...
- I'm sorry this came up.

470
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:43,161
No, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry this came up, and...

471
00:38:43,462 --> 00:38:47,061
- I'm... I'm gonna go.
- Here, I'll take it.

472
00:38:47,262 --> 00:38:49,162
- OK. Yeah. All right.
- Bye.

473
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,959
He doesn't want you to come over.

474
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,659
What do you mean?
Did you tell him about me?

475
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:08,158
- No, I didn't.
- Why not?

476
00:39:08,459 --> 00:39:11,658
- Look, Cynthia, I didn't have time.
- Well, why?

477
00:39:12,758 --> 00:39:16,358
John's right. He's strange and you
don't wanna get involved with him.

478
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:18,358
What happened over there?

479
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:20,658
- Did he make a pass at you?
- No.

480
00:39:20,959 --> 00:39:25,057
Well, what's this "strange" bullshit
all of a sudden? Is he drownin' puppies?

481
00:39:25,458 --> 00:39:27,557
It's nothin' like that, OK?

482
00:39:27,757 --> 00:39:32,156
- Well, what? Is he dangerous?
- No. Not physically.

483
00:39:32,458 --> 00:39:37,056
- Well, what, then?
- I don't wanna talk about it.

484
00:39:37,457 --> 00:39:39,655
- Then why did you call me?
- I don't know.

485
00:39:50,255 --> 00:39:52,554
- Hello?
- Cynthia, John.

486
00:39:52,756 --> 00:39:55,854
Not today. I've got other plans.

487
00:39:57,055 --> 00:39:59,553
Oh. Well, when, then?

488
00:40:01,153 --> 00:40:03,552
How about inviting me over to dinner?

489
00:40:03,754 --> 00:40:07,154
- You know what I mean.
- Yeah, I know what you mean.

490
00:40:13,653 --> 00:40:16,751
- It's open.

491
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,551
- Hi.
- Hello.

492
00:40:28,252 --> 00:40:30,950
- Can I help you?
- I'm Cynthia Bishop.

493
00:40:32,252 --> 00:40:35,650
- Do I know you? I don't...
- I'm Ann Millaney's sister.

494
00:40:36,550 --> 00:40:38,250
The extrovert.

495
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:41,850
She must have been in a good mood.
She usually calls me loud.

496
00:40:42,149 --> 00:40:44,548
Yeah, she called you that, too.

497
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:49,248
So, uh, what are you doin' here?

498
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:53,548
- You want me to leave?
- No, I just wanna know why you're here.

499
00:40:53,749 --> 00:40:59,547
Well, like I said, Ann is my sister.
Sisters talk. You can imagine the rest.

500
00:41:01,848 --> 00:41:06,346
No, I think it's probably better
if I don't characterise that conversation

501
00:41:06,748 --> 00:41:08,747
that I didn't hear.

502
00:41:09,948 --> 00:41:16,646
I don't have any idea, really, what you
or Ann said about me or anything else.

503
00:41:19,946 --> 00:41:22,644
- Do you want some iced tea?
- Sure.

504
00:41:23,146 --> 00:41:25,544
I don't have any lemons.

505
00:41:25,746 --> 00:41:32,242
The last time I saw Ann she left here
very confused, I'd say, and upset.

506
00:41:32,745 --> 00:41:34,545
She still is.

507
00:41:36,544 --> 00:41:41,043
So, are you here to make me feel bad
for makin' her feel bad?

508
00:41:43,444 --> 00:41:44,942
No.

509
00:41:48,643 --> 00:41:51,540
- She didn't tell you why she was upset?
- No.

510
00:41:58,743 --> 00:42:00,241
Thanks.

511
00:42:05,242 --> 00:42:10,040
So, I don't understand
what made you wanna come here.

512
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:14,939
I can't imagine Ann painted
a very flattering portrait of me.

513
00:42:15,341 --> 00:42:19,540
Yeah, well, see, um, I don't really
listen to Ann when it comes to men.

514
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:23,839
I mean, look at John, for Christ's sake.

515
00:42:24,139 --> 00:42:26,737
But then, you went to school
with him, didn't you?

516
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:29,238
You're probably friends or somethin'.

517
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,137
No.

518
00:42:33,338 --> 00:42:35,636
No, I think John is a liar.

519
00:42:39,038 --> 00:42:41,137
I think you're right.

520
00:42:42,937 --> 00:42:47,935
So come on, I came all the way over here
to find out what got Ann so spooked.

521
00:42:48,337 --> 00:42:51,235
Why don't you tell me what happened?

522
00:42:51,637 --> 00:42:57,435
"Spooked"? The videotapes
are what got Ann so spooked.

523
00:43:14,035 --> 00:43:15,533
Oh.

524
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,232
I think I get it.

525
00:43:18,534 --> 00:43:21,033
Oh, yeah? What do you get?

526
00:43:21,233 --> 00:43:24,633
If Ann got freaked out by these,
they must be somethin' sexual.

527
00:43:24,932 --> 00:43:27,531
Are these tapes of you
havin' sex with these girls?

528
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:32,132
- No, not exactly.
- Either you are or you aren't. Which is it?

529
00:43:32,432 --> 00:43:37,430
- Why don't you let me tape you?
- Doin' what?

530
00:43:37,832 --> 00:43:39,830
- Talking.
- About what?

531
00:43:40,731 --> 00:43:44,931
About sex. Your sexual history,
sexual preferences.

532
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:51,328
- What makes you think I'd discuss that?
- Nothing.

533
00:43:57,029 --> 00:44:01,728
- And you just wanna ask me questions?
- I just wanna ask you questions.

534
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:04,027
- That's all?
- That's all.

535
00:44:08,328 --> 00:44:13,326
Is this how you get off? Tapin' women
talkin' about their sexual experiences?

536
00:44:13,628 --> 00:44:16,526
- Yes.
- Would anyone else see the tape?

537
00:44:16,827 --> 00:44:20,727
Absolutely not. Nobody else
sees the tapes except for me.

538
00:44:21,526 --> 00:44:23,625
How long will it take?

539
00:44:25,427 --> 00:44:29,826
Well, that depends on you.
One woman used up only three minutes.

540
00:44:30,826 --> 00:44:33,225
And another used three two-hour tapes.

541
00:44:36,425 --> 00:44:38,525
How do we start?

542
00:44:38,826 --> 00:44:41,724
I turn on the camera and you start talking.

543
00:44:43,924 --> 00:44:45,923
Do I sit or stand?

544
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:49,123
- What do you prefer?
- I'd prefer to sit.

545
00:44:57,323 --> 00:44:59,322
Are you ready?

546
00:45:06,323 --> 00:45:08,621
OK, I'm recording.

547
00:45:08,822 --> 00:45:13,221
- So tell me your name.
- Cynthia... Patrice... Bishop.

548
00:45:13,521 --> 00:45:16,120
- You can speak in a normal voice.
- OK.

549
00:45:18,121 --> 00:45:21,219
So, describe for me
your first sexual experience.

550
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:27,119
Um...

551
00:45:27,321 --> 00:45:30,119
First sexual experience
or first time I had intercourse?

552
00:45:30,421 --> 00:45:34,020
- First sexual experience.
- Sexual experience.

553
00:45:41,019 --> 00:45:44,818
I was... uh... eight.

554
00:45:46,518 --> 00:45:50,517
And, uh...
Is this the kinda thing that...? Yeah, OK.

555
00:45:52,518 --> 00:45:58,415
I was eight years old, and, um,
Michael Green, who was also eight,

556
00:45:59,617 --> 00:46:02,116
asked if he could watch me take a pee.

557
00:46:02,316 --> 00:46:06,215
And I said he could
if I could watch him take one, too.

558
00:46:06,617 --> 00:46:10,216
So we went to the woods
behind my house.

559
00:46:11,215 --> 00:46:16,514
And I got this feeling he was chickenin'
out cos he kept sayin' "Ladies first!"

560
00:46:16,915 --> 00:46:22,013
So I pulled down
my little panties and urinated,

561
00:46:22,315 --> 00:46:25,313
and he ran away before I even finished.

562
00:46:27,214 --> 00:46:30,112
Was it a topic of conversation
between you after that?

563
00:46:30,414 --> 00:46:33,312
No! He kind of avoided me
for the rest of the summer,

564
00:46:33,612 --> 00:46:36,211
and then his family moved away.

565
00:46:37,513 --> 00:46:40,111
To Cleveland, actually.

566
00:46:40,312 --> 00:46:42,311
What a shame.

567
00:46:44,212 --> 00:46:46,810
When did you finally see a penis?

568
00:46:48,213 --> 00:46:50,211
When I was 14.

569
00:46:51,812 --> 00:46:54,210
So, what'd you think?

570
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:57,810
Was it what you expected it to be?

571
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:06,008
No. Not really. I...

572
00:47:09,709 --> 00:47:12,508
I didn't... I sorta pictured it, um...

573
00:47:16,009 --> 00:47:20,207
I didn't think it would have
veins or ridges or anything.

574
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:23,808
I just thought it would be smooth,
like a test tube.

575
00:47:25,408 --> 00:47:28,106
It's weird, thinking about it now.

576
00:47:32,807 --> 00:47:40,305
The... organ itself seemed like
a separate thing, a separate entity to me.

577
00:47:40,807 --> 00:47:45,505
I mean, when he finally pulled it out
and I could look at it and touch it,

578
00:47:45,806 --> 00:47:48,304
I forgot that there was a guy attached to it.

579
00:47:48,506 --> 00:47:52,204
I remember literally being startled
when the guy spoke to me.

580
00:47:53,205 --> 00:47:56,605
- What did he say?
- He said my hand felt good.

581
00:48:00,704 --> 00:48:02,803
Then what happened?

582
00:48:04,904 --> 00:48:07,003
And...

583
00:48:07,203 --> 00:48:12,303
Then I started movin' my hand,
and then he stopped talkin'.

584
00:48:35,401 --> 00:48:37,401
- Yeah?
- John, Cynthia.

585
00:48:39,101 --> 00:48:42,601
- How'd you get through?
- I told Janet I was Ann.

586
00:48:42,900 --> 00:48:44,899
Ah. She bought it?

587
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:47,298
Well, obviously.

588
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:51,598
Look... I want to see you.

589
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:54,998
- Ah. When?
- Right now.

590
00:48:55,199 --> 00:48:57,697
I don't know if I can do that.
I got a client waiting.

591
00:48:57,899 --> 00:49:03,398
I've already rescheduled him once.
I'd have to do some heavy-duty juggling.

592
00:49:03,698 --> 00:49:06,796
Then get those balls in the air
and get your butt over here.

593
00:49:26,895 --> 00:49:28,994
- Yes, sir?
- Janet.

594
00:49:30,095 --> 00:49:33,293
Listen, I want you to reschedule Kirkland.
I know, I know.

595
00:49:33,494 --> 00:49:36,293
See if he can come in Monday, any time.

596
00:49:36,694 --> 00:49:39,092
Tell him, uh... Tell him, uh...

597
00:49:40,395 --> 00:49:43,093
- Family crisis. Family crisis.
- OK.

598
00:49:43,293 --> 00:49:45,292
- I'll slip out the back.
- Yes, sir.

599
00:49:45,494 --> 00:49:47,493
All right. Bye.

600
00:49:51,293 --> 00:49:54,391
Would you like me to take my skirt off?

601
00:49:58,891 --> 00:50:00,891
If you wish.

602
00:50:22,289 --> 00:50:24,788
You're not wearing any underwear.

603
00:50:29,990 --> 00:50:32,388
Do you like the way I look?

604
00:50:33,689 --> 00:50:35,588
Yes.

605
00:50:38,889 --> 00:50:41,187
Do you think I'm pretty?

606
00:50:42,288 --> 00:50:43,787
Yes.

607
00:50:48,286 --> 00:50:50,285
Prettier than Ann?

608
00:50:51,486 --> 00:50:53,385
Different.

609
00:50:58,786 --> 00:51:01,384
John and Ann don't have sex any more.

610
00:51:07,184 --> 00:51:09,484
Is that what he tells you?

611
00:51:09,685 --> 00:51:11,983
He doesn't have to tell me.

612
00:51:24,984 --> 00:51:27,083
You're on fire today.

613
00:51:35,083 --> 00:51:36,681
Yes.

614
00:51:40,081 --> 00:51:41,979
You can go now.

615
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:52,179
What kind of questions?

616
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,079
Questions... about... sex.

617
00:51:58,679 --> 00:52:01,478
Well, what did he ask, exactly?

618
00:52:01,779 --> 00:52:04,876
Well, I don't wanna tell you, exactly.

619
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:11,877
You let a total stranger record your sexual
life, but you won't tell your own sister?

620
00:52:12,277 --> 00:52:16,576
- Apparently.
- Did he ask you to take your clothes off?

621
00:52:19,577 --> 00:52:22,576
Did he ask me to take my clothes off?
No, he didn't.

622
00:52:22,877 --> 00:52:24,776
- Did you take your clothes off?
- Yes.

623
00:52:24,977 --> 00:52:27,275
- Cynthia!
- What?

624
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,475
- Why did you do that?
- Because I wanted to.

625
00:52:29,776 --> 00:52:32,774
- But why did you want to?
- Because I wanted him to see me.

626
00:52:32,976 --> 00:52:36,275
You're crazy. He could be
bouncin' it off some satellite.

627
00:52:36,676 --> 00:52:41,174
- Some horny old men could be watchin'.
- Ann! He wouldn't do that.

628
00:52:41,575 --> 00:52:45,573
- You don't know that for sure.
- Well, it's too late now, isn't it?

629
00:52:47,375 --> 00:52:50,172
- Did he touch you?
- No.

630
00:52:52,074 --> 00:52:54,572
- Did you touch him?
- No.

631
00:52:59,574 --> 00:53:01,872
Did anybody touch anybody?

632
00:53:03,473 --> 00:53:05,672
Well, yes.

633
00:53:07,873 --> 00:53:10,271
Don't tell me.

634
00:53:10,572 --> 00:53:13,870
Don't tell me. Don't tell me. You didn't.

635
00:53:14,271 --> 00:53:16,370
- I did.
- You didn't.

636
00:53:16,672 --> 00:53:20,171
- I did!
- Oh, my God. Cynthia!

637
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:25,769
You're in trouble.

638
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:30,169
Listen to you. You sound like Momma.
What are you talkin' about?

639
00:53:31,970 --> 00:53:33,870
God, Cynthia.

640
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:37,669
- I couldn't do that in front of John.
- You couldn't do it, period.

641
00:53:38,069 --> 00:53:41,368
- I mean, you don't even know him.
- I feel like I do.

642
00:53:41,568 --> 00:53:44,167
You don't.
You can't trust him. He's perverted.

643
00:53:45,068 --> 00:53:47,467
I don't understand why
this freaks you out so much.

644
00:53:47,668 --> 00:53:51,468
You didn't do it, I did, and if it doesn't
bother me, why should it bother you?

645
00:53:53,067 --> 00:53:56,265
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- OK, then, don't.

646
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:18,163
Are... are you an assassin?

647
00:54:19,165 --> 00:54:22,664
- Excuse me?
- You're just an errand boy,

648
00:54:22,864 --> 00:54:25,663
sent by the grocer to collect the bill.

649
00:54:31,263 --> 00:54:34,763
It's my Brando. That's pretty good,
isn't it? Marlon Brando.

650
00:54:35,064 --> 00:54:37,362
It's great. Pardon me.

651
00:54:37,563 --> 00:54:42,261
OK. I was thinkin' we needed time apart.
Maybe you should be there for a while.

652
00:54:43,763 --> 00:54:47,762
Hi. So, why don't you get
an answering machine?

653
00:54:48,061 --> 00:54:50,760
- There's a phone here.
- It's busy.

654
00:54:51,461 --> 00:54:53,860
Well, why don't you keep tryin'?

655
00:54:55,662 --> 00:54:57,260
OK.

656
00:54:59,461 --> 00:55:02,159
- Well, here it is.
- What is it?

657
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:05,359
- It's a sundress.
- Looks like a tablecloth.

658
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,859
- It does not.
- Why would she want a sundress?

659
00:55:09,059 --> 00:55:11,758
She's got spots on her shoulders
and varicose veins.

660
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:16,558
- Well, missy thing, so will you someday.
- When I do, I won't wear sundresses.

661
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:20,659
- God, Cynthia...
- Hold on.

662
00:55:33,657 --> 00:55:35,657
- Bayou.
- Cynthia, John.

663
00:55:35,857 --> 00:55:39,556
- Would you like to speak with your wife?
- What's she doin' there?

664
00:55:39,856 --> 00:55:43,155
Showing me a present
she and I are buying your mother-in-law.

665
00:55:43,455 --> 00:55:47,754
Oh. Great. So, when can I see you?

666
00:55:48,056 --> 00:55:52,455
I don't know. I'm not sure I can
duplicate the intensity I had the other day.

667
00:55:52,855 --> 00:55:54,954
Nothin' wrong with trying.

668
00:55:55,254 --> 00:55:57,753
I don't think my sister would agree.

669
00:55:57,955 --> 00:56:00,953
Do you want me to stop calling?

670
00:56:01,155 --> 00:56:03,653
- Look, I'll call you. OK?
- Roger.

671
00:56:07,154 --> 00:56:12,552
This is too much. I'm wearing red, you're
wearing red. That's quite a coincidence...

672
00:56:12,853 --> 00:56:15,551
- Look, I'm married.
- Really?

673
00:56:15,752 --> 00:56:17,751
Are you very married?

674
00:56:18,053 --> 00:56:20,651
- Married enough.
- Oh. Oh.

675
00:56:20,952 --> 00:56:24,751
- I see. Well, that shouldn't stop us...
- I'm just here to see my sister. OK?

676
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:28,250
Oh, really?
Who's your sister? Is she married?

677
00:56:30,252 --> 00:56:32,750
So, um, what's my share of the dress?

678
00:56:33,152 --> 00:56:35,650
- 32.50.
- It's a nice dress.

679
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:38,549
- Thanks. I thought so, too.
- Looks like a tablecloth.

680
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:43,249
Keep the change. And, Ann, don't worry
about the dress. I'm sure she'll like it.

681
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:48,750
Yeah. I think it'll...
Oh, you have to go? OK. Goodbye.

682
00:56:48,949 --> 00:56:51,348
I'll see you later. I'll call you!

683
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,555
Bye.

1
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:18,849
John?

2
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:21,448
Mm?

3
00:57:23,548 --> 00:57:25,448
- John?

4
00:57:27,447 --> 00:57:32,046
I called you last Monday at 3:30
and they said you weren't in.

5
00:57:33,647 --> 00:57:36,046
Do you remember where you were?

6
00:57:37,546 --> 00:57:38,845
On Monday?

7
00:57:40,047 --> 00:57:42,646
Uh... Last Monday?

8
00:57:43,947 --> 00:57:45,945
Oh, I had a late lunch.

9
00:57:48,045 --> 00:57:50,444
So, who'd you have lunch with?

10
00:57:54,945 --> 00:57:57,143
I ate by myself.

11
00:57:58,944 --> 00:58:00,943
Come on.

12
00:58:08,142 --> 00:58:12,241
- Is there somethin' wrong?
- Are you havin' an affair?

13
00:58:16,241 --> 00:58:18,140
Jesus Christ!

14
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:23,838
I have a late lunch by myself
and now I'm fuckin' somebody?

15
00:58:24,139 --> 00:58:26,338
- Well, are you?
- No, I'm not.

16
00:58:27,439 --> 00:58:30,737
God, I'm offended
at the accusation. Come on.

17
00:58:34,438 --> 00:58:36,737
If I'm right, I wanna know.

18
00:58:37,038 --> 00:58:41,038
I don't want you to lie. I'd be upset,
but I'd be more upset if you lied to me.

19
00:58:43,838 --> 00:58:46,037
Well, there's nothin' to know.

20
00:58:48,936 --> 00:58:52,234
I can't tell you
how upset I'll be if you lie to me.

21
00:58:58,034 --> 00:58:59,933
This is paranoia.

22
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:07,134
I mean... if anybody
should be paranoid, I should be.

23
00:59:09,334 --> 00:59:13,733
Here, every time I try to touch you,
you act as if I'm dipped in shit.

24
00:59:15,732 --> 00:59:19,131
I think there are a lot of women
out there that'd be glad to have

25
00:59:19,532 --> 00:59:22,931
a young, straight male
makin' a pretty good living

26
00:59:24,332 --> 00:59:27,430
beside 'em in bed with a... with a hard-on.

27
00:59:27,630 --> 00:59:29,929
- My sister, for one.
- For God's sake, Ann.

28
00:59:30,230 --> 00:59:33,528
- Is that who it is?
- Ann, I'm not fucking your sister.

29
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:36,928
I don't find her that attractive,
for one thing.

30
00:59:37,130 --> 00:59:40,028
- Is that supposed to comfort me?
- No, I'm just saying.

31
00:59:40,329 --> 00:59:45,127
I'm just saying I didn't get paranoid
when you didn't wanna make love to me.

32
00:59:45,528 --> 00:59:50,827
I could have assumed that you didn't want
to because you were having an affair.

33
00:59:51,428 --> 00:59:54,126
- I'm not.
- Well, I'm not either. Now, come on.

34
00:59:54,327 --> 00:59:58,426
- Then why don't I believe you?
- Oh, look. This is ridiculous.

35
00:59:58,727 --> 01:00:01,525
- Maybe when you have evidence...
- There's evidence?

36
01:00:01,826 --> 01:00:06,324
That's not what I'm saying. I'm just
saying that we shouldn't not ever talk,

37
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:09,423
just don't give me
conjecture and intuition.

38
01:00:10,224 --> 01:00:12,224
- Always a lawyer.
- Goddamn right.

39
01:00:12,524 --> 01:00:16,323
I mean, can you imagine? "Your Honour,
I'm positive the man is guilty."

40
01:00:16,624 --> 01:00:19,123
- "I can't place him at the scene..."
- All right.

41
01:00:19,423 --> 01:00:23,122
- "But I have this strong feeling..."
- All right. You made your point. OK.

42
01:00:23,422 --> 01:00:25,422
All right.

43
01:00:29,323 --> 01:00:31,222
I'm sorry.

44
01:00:32,122 --> 01:00:34,021
I'm sorry.

45
01:00:35,321 --> 01:00:39,421
I'm just under a lot of pressure
with this... this Kirkland thing.

46
01:00:40,421 --> 01:00:44,119
I mean, you know
it's my first big case as junior partner.

47
01:00:45,919 --> 01:00:48,917
I work all day and I come home.

48
01:00:49,219 --> 01:00:51,718
I look forward to seeing you.

49
01:00:55,918 --> 01:00:59,317
It hurts that you'd accuse me like that.

50
01:01:00,817 --> 01:01:02,717
I'm sorry.

51
01:01:04,617 --> 01:01:06,915
What? Come on.

52
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:13,615
I've just got all this time
on my hands, and I just sit around

53
01:01:13,916 --> 01:01:18,215
and start inventing these,
like, intricate scenarios.

54
01:01:20,015 --> 01:01:24,714
And then I don't want to have wasted
all my time, so I wanna believe 'em.

55
01:01:27,815 --> 01:01:31,513
- Isn't therapy helpin' at all?
- Oh, John, I don't know.

56
01:01:31,714 --> 01:01:35,011
I just feel so stupid sittin'
talkin' about my little problems

57
01:01:35,313 --> 01:01:38,411
when I know
those poor children are starving.

58
01:01:39,012 --> 01:01:40,611
Well...

59
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:49,909
Quitting your therapy's not gonna...
not gonna feed the children in Ethiopia.

60
01:01:51,410 --> 01:01:53,409
I know.

61
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:01,108
You never used to say the word "fucking".

62
01:02:04,008 --> 01:02:05,506
Fuck.

63
01:02:08,607 --> 01:02:11,506
It's so stupid, I have a hard time
believing you did it.

64
01:02:11,907 --> 01:02:14,405
- What's so stupid about it?
- Well, you...

65
01:02:16,208 --> 01:02:19,604
- You don't even know the guy.
- Well, you know him.

66
01:02:20,006 --> 01:02:23,806
He's a friend of yours.
Do you think he can be trusted?

67
01:02:24,206 --> 01:02:25,605
I don't know.

68
01:02:27,505 --> 01:02:31,604
I don't know.
From what you've told me, I don't know.

69
01:02:31,904 --> 01:02:35,103
I shoulda known when
he showed up dressed like

70
01:02:35,304 --> 01:02:37,304
some undertaker for the art world.

71
01:02:37,503 --> 01:02:39,602
I like the way he dresses.

72
01:02:49,301 --> 01:02:52,399
What if this tape
gets into the wrong hands?

73
01:02:52,601 --> 01:02:57,699
"The wrong hands"? John, we are not
talking about military secrets here.

74
01:02:58,101 --> 01:03:03,399
They're just tapes he makes
so he can sit around and get off.

75
01:03:05,600 --> 01:03:08,698
And he doesn't have sex
with any of them? They just talk?

76
01:03:09,299 --> 01:03:12,197
They just sit around and talk.

77
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:18,597
I could almost understand it
if he had sex with them. I mean, almost.

78
01:03:19,698 --> 01:03:23,697
Why doesn't he just buy some magazines
or some porno movies or somethin'?

79
01:03:24,497 --> 01:03:28,596
Doesn't work. He has to know the people.
He has to be able to interact with them.

80
01:03:28,896 --> 01:03:30,894
Interact?

81
01:03:31,196 --> 01:03:33,095
Whatever that means.

82
01:03:34,696 --> 01:03:36,895
Did you have to masturbate
in front of him?

83
01:03:37,095 --> 01:03:40,793
I felt like it. Goddamn. You and Ann
make such a big deal out of this.

84
01:03:40,993 --> 01:03:43,393
- You told Ann about this?
- She is my sister.

85
01:03:43,594 --> 01:03:46,192
- I tell her almost everything.
- I wish you hadn't.

86
01:03:46,395 --> 01:03:49,893
It's just something I'd prefer
she didn't have to know about.

87
01:03:50,294 --> 01:03:53,691
- She's a grown-up. She can handle it.
- Ann...

88
01:03:55,392 --> 01:03:58,090
- Ann is just very...
- Hung up.

89
01:03:59,791 --> 01:04:03,190
- It just wasn't a smart thing to do.
- Oh, God!

90
01:04:05,991 --> 01:04:09,790
Did you sign any sort of paper,
or did he have a contract with you

91
01:04:10,090 --> 01:04:13,188
saying that he wouldn't
broadcast these things?

92
01:04:13,590 --> 01:04:15,489
No, sir.

93
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:18,189
You realise you have no recourse legally?

94
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:24,087
It's not funny. It's not funny, Cynthia.

95
01:04:24,389 --> 01:04:26,987
These tapes could show up anywhere.

96
01:04:27,187 --> 01:04:29,587
They won't. I trust him.

97
01:04:30,988 --> 01:04:33,586
You trust him? That's funny.

98
01:04:33,786 --> 01:04:37,284
Yeah, I do.
A hell of a lot more than I trust you.

99
01:04:40,486 --> 01:04:43,184
- What do you mean?
- Just what I said.

100
01:04:43,385 --> 01:04:45,884
I'd trust him before I'd trust you.

101
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:52,284
- It hurts that you say that to me.
- You're fucking your wife's sister.

102
01:04:52,683 --> 01:04:54,583
You're a liar. But at least I know that.

103
01:04:54,783 --> 01:04:59,482
I know, I know. Second-lowest form
of human being. And the first.

104
01:04:59,882 --> 01:05:04,081
- What are you talking about?
- Nothing. You're lying to Ann, too.

105
01:05:04,383 --> 01:05:10,081
Yeah, right, but I didn't take a vow in front
of God and everyone to be faithful to Ann.

106
01:05:17,381 --> 01:05:20,179
Look, are we gonna do it or not?

107
01:05:21,080 --> 01:05:25,678
Actually... no. I've changed my mind.
I shouldn't have called.

108
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:32,478
Well, I'm here now.
I need to do somethin'.

109
01:05:32,879 --> 01:05:35,277
Would you like
to help me straighten up?

110
01:05:37,077 --> 01:05:38,876
Jesus!

111
01:05:39,077 --> 01:05:42,076
Is there one chair
in this place that works?

112
01:05:42,277 --> 01:05:45,474
Well, why don't you
go sit somewhere else?

113
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:50,074
Come on, John. You should be happy.

114
01:05:50,276 --> 01:05:54,075
We've gone this far without Ann findin'
out. I'm makin' it real easy on you.

115
01:05:54,475 --> 01:05:57,074
- Just walk out of here.
- Did he put you up to this?

116
01:05:57,375 --> 01:05:59,274
- Who?
- Graham.

117
01:05:59,474 --> 01:06:03,573
No, he didn't put me up to this. Jesus,
I don't need people to tell me what to do.

118
01:06:03,874 --> 01:06:07,173
I've just been thinkin', that's all.
Now just... leave.

119
01:06:08,974 --> 01:06:11,572
Maybe I don't wanna leave.

120
01:06:11,872 --> 01:06:14,172
Maybe I wanna talk.

121
01:06:14,372 --> 01:06:17,670
John, we don't have
anything to talk about.

122
01:06:20,171 --> 01:06:22,170
Yeah, you're right.

123
01:06:24,171 --> 01:06:26,970
Things are gettin' complicated.

124
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:29,469
No, they're gettin' real simple.

125
01:09:06,147 --> 01:09:07,646
It's open!

126
01:09:16,446 --> 01:09:17,944
Hello.

127
01:09:22,546 --> 01:09:24,645
Want something to drink?

128
01:09:27,144 --> 01:09:29,044
Yeah, thanks.

129
01:09:36,544 --> 01:09:39,342
I'm sorry, I don't have any iced tea left.

130
01:09:43,642 --> 01:09:45,541
Thank you.

131
01:09:51,442 --> 01:09:55,441
John and Cynthia have been... fucking.

132
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,339
Yes, I know.

133
01:10:01,339 --> 01:10:03,838
- You know?
- Yes.

134
01:10:06,039 --> 01:10:08,437
How did you know?

135
01:10:11,538 --> 01:10:13,837
She said it on her tape.

136
01:10:14,138 --> 01:10:17,037
Thanks for telling me.
I really appreciate it.

137
01:10:17,337 --> 01:10:19,536
Well, I... I haven't seen you.

138
01:10:20,737 --> 01:10:24,636
And I don't think I would've told you
even if I had seen you.

139
01:10:24,936 --> 01:10:26,835
Why not?

140
01:10:28,535 --> 01:10:30,834
Because it's not really my place.

141
01:10:39,734 --> 01:10:41,633
My life is shit.

142
01:10:43,233 --> 01:10:45,133
It's just shit.

143
01:10:47,433 --> 01:10:49,732
Nothing's what I thought it was.

144
01:10:57,731 --> 01:10:59,730
John's a bastard.

145
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,229
Let's make a videotape.

146
01:11:12,629 --> 01:11:14,528
No, I...

147
01:11:15,829 --> 01:11:20,227
- I don't think that's a good idea.
- Why not?

148
01:11:20,928 --> 01:11:25,326
Because I don't think it's a choice that
you'd make in a normal frame of mind.

149
01:11:25,629 --> 01:11:28,426
And what would you know
about a normal frame of mind?

150
01:11:32,628 --> 01:11:34,726
That's a good question.

151
01:11:38,225 --> 01:11:41,024
- So, what do you have to do to get ready?
- Uh...

152
01:11:45,425 --> 01:11:47,823
Load a tape and turn on the camera.

153
01:11:50,523 --> 01:11:52,423
Do it.

154
01:12:01,222 --> 01:12:05,420
So, where do you get your money from,

155
01:12:05,822 --> 01:12:09,921
for rent, and tapes, and stuff like that?

156
01:12:11,921 --> 01:12:14,020
Underneath my mattress.

157
01:12:15,721 --> 01:12:18,618
And what are you gonna do
when this money runs out?

158
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,919
It won't.

159
01:12:22,720 --> 01:12:25,717
Are you comfortable there?

160
01:12:26,019 --> 01:12:28,218
Yeah, I'm comfortable.

161
01:12:31,918 --> 01:12:34,217
OK, I'm recording.

162
01:12:34,418 --> 01:12:36,316
Tell me your name.

163
01:12:39,217 --> 01:12:41,216
Ann Bishop Millaney.

164
01:13:13,613 --> 01:13:17,712
Margaret. Hi, it's John. Fine.
Listen, have you seen Ann at all today?

165
01:13:18,111 --> 01:13:20,011
This afternoon?

166
01:13:20,311 --> 01:13:23,010
Uh... Well, no, I just...

167
01:13:23,310 --> 01:13:26,709
She's home. Bye-bye.
Everything's fine. Thanks. Bye.

168
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,809
Thank God. You had me worried sick.

169
01:13:30,009 --> 01:13:33,507
I come home,
the door is open, the car is gone.

170
01:13:34,609 --> 01:13:37,906
I thought you'd been
abducted by some mad fucker.

171
01:13:39,909 --> 01:13:43,407
- Are you all right?
- I want out of this marriage.

172
01:13:49,507 --> 01:13:51,105
What?

173
01:13:52,907 --> 01:13:57,704
I... want... out... of this marriage.

174
01:14:04,404 --> 01:14:05,803
Why?

175
01:14:06,605 --> 01:14:08,103
Why?

176
01:14:10,505 --> 01:14:12,703
You're asking me why?

177
01:14:15,404 --> 01:14:18,401
I'm married to you
and you want out of this marriage.

178
01:14:18,703 --> 01:14:20,702
I think you could tell me that.

179
01:14:22,202 --> 01:14:25,901
Fuck you. Fuck you.

180
01:14:31,401 --> 01:14:33,401
All right.

181
01:14:36,501 --> 01:14:39,999
- Can you tell me where you went?
- I drove around.

182
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,898
- Then I went over to Graham's.
- Graham's?

183
01:14:43,799 --> 01:14:45,397
Graham.

184
01:14:51,199 --> 01:14:53,198
Goddamn that son of a bitch!

185
01:14:53,397 --> 01:14:56,495
The backstabbin' son of a...
Oh, Mr Honesty, huh?

186
01:14:56,698 --> 01:14:58,696
Mr Apostle of Truth!

187
01:15:11,094 --> 01:15:13,593
Well, I know you didn't fuck him.

188
01:15:23,994 --> 01:15:27,292
Did you make one of
these goddamn videotapes?

189
01:15:32,393 --> 01:15:35,991
Annie... answer me, goddammit.

190
01:15:36,392 --> 01:15:38,690
Goddammit, answer me. Did you?

191
01:15:40,091 --> 01:15:42,090
- Yes, I did.
- Ah!

192
01:15:44,191 --> 01:15:45,689
God!

193
01:15:45,990 --> 01:15:47,688
Don't you touch him!

194
01:16:04,487 --> 01:16:06,585
OK. I'm gonna...

195
01:16:08,488 --> 01:16:11,385
- What?

196
01:16:12,387 --> 01:16:13,985
Hello?

197
01:16:16,086 --> 01:16:19,784
John? What the hell are you doing here?
What are you doing?

198
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:07,178
OK, I'm recording.

199
01:17:09,378 --> 01:17:11,377
Tell me your name.

200
01:17:13,378 --> 01:17:16,376
Ann... Bishop... Millaney.

201
01:17:18,076 --> 01:17:20,275
So, what do you wanna talk about?

202
01:17:20,477 --> 01:17:23,675
- What do you usually talk about?
- Sex.

203
01:17:23,976 --> 01:17:26,375
OK. Let's talk about sex.

204
01:17:27,875 --> 01:17:30,174
Do you have sex?

205
01:17:30,375 --> 01:17:32,773
Not very often, no.

206
01:17:34,475 --> 01:17:37,573
When you do, who usually initiates it?

207
01:17:37,774 --> 01:17:39,673
He does.

208
01:17:41,874 --> 01:17:43,973
Is the sex satisfying?

209
01:17:49,473 --> 01:17:51,373
I don't know.

210
01:17:52,371 --> 01:17:55,069
I don't know. I don't know what you mean.

211
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,470
Do you have orgasms?

212
01:17:59,771 --> 01:18:01,970
I don't think so.

213
01:18:02,570 --> 01:18:06,469
I mean, I guess, since I'm not sure,
that I've never had one.

214
01:18:27,267 --> 01:18:32,466
Have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband?

215
01:18:32,866 --> 01:18:35,264
Here we go.

216
01:18:36,266 --> 01:18:38,165
Here we go.

217
01:18:45,465 --> 01:18:47,763
- Why don't we stop?
- No.

218
01:18:48,064 --> 01:18:50,063
I don't wanna stop.

219
01:18:58,762 --> 01:19:03,360
Have you ever thought about having sex
with someone other than your husband?

220
01:19:03,661 --> 01:19:05,860
I've thought about it.

221
01:19:06,661 --> 01:19:09,060
- Did you act on it?
- No.

222
01:19:11,060 --> 01:19:12,959
Why not?

223
01:19:14,060 --> 01:19:19,459
Because that's how Cynthia thinks.
I hate it when I have feelings that she has.

224
01:19:22,459 --> 01:19:27,556
It bothers me when I think about men,
because I know that's the way she thinks.

225
01:19:31,457 --> 01:19:33,956
What other men have you thought about?

226
01:19:38,156 --> 01:19:40,355
I thought about you.

227
01:19:42,556 --> 01:19:45,255
- Have you thought about me?
- Yes.

228
01:19:51,455 --> 01:19:53,453
What did you think?

229
01:19:55,653 --> 01:19:58,751
I thought about what you would
look like having an orgasm.

230
01:20:07,453 --> 01:20:10,650
I'd like to know
what I look like havin' an orgasm.

231
01:20:16,552 --> 01:20:19,449
Can you do that?
Give a woman an orgasm?

232
01:20:24,250 --> 01:20:25,449
Yes.

233
01:20:26,549 --> 01:20:28,648
Could you do that for me?

234
01:20:32,349 --> 01:20:35,547
- No.
- Why not?

235
01:20:37,149 --> 01:20:39,047
Because I can't.

236
01:20:39,248 --> 01:20:42,246
- Can't or won't?
- I can't because I won't.

237
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:57,046
- You said you weren't always impotent.
- No. Yeah, that's correct.

238
01:20:58,944 --> 01:21:01,643
- So you have had sex.
- Yes.

239
01:21:04,445 --> 01:21:09,043
So, what happened?
Was it so bad it turned you off, or...?

240
01:21:12,543 --> 01:21:15,740
- No, that wasn't the problem.
- What was the problem?

241
01:21:16,443 --> 01:21:18,841
I was the problem. I was a...

242
01:21:21,542 --> 01:21:23,841
I was a pathological liar.

243
01:21:24,541 --> 01:21:26,940
Or I am, I should say.

244
01:21:27,241 --> 01:21:30,539
The lying is...

245
01:21:32,241 --> 01:21:36,239
Lying is like alcoholism,
you're continually recovering.

246
01:21:37,540 --> 01:21:39,439
So that's it?

247
01:21:40,238 --> 01:21:42,238
You lied?

248
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:47,437
- That was part of it.
- So, what else happened?

249
01:21:49,738 --> 01:21:53,135
Well, at that time, uh... I...

250
01:21:58,137 --> 01:22:01,534
I used to express my feelings nonverbally,

251
01:22:06,936 --> 01:22:09,034
and often scared people

252
01:22:11,235 --> 01:22:13,334
that were close to me.

253
01:22:14,735 --> 01:22:16,933
Are you still like that?

254
01:22:18,435 --> 01:22:19,933
No.

255
01:22:21,633 --> 01:22:23,132
No.

256
01:22:28,533 --> 01:22:30,731
So you're never gonna make love again?

257
01:22:31,031 --> 01:22:34,130
I don't... I haven't made any plans, so...

258
01:22:40,432 --> 01:22:43,729
- If you were in love with me, would you?
- I'm not in love with you.

259
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:46,428
- But if you were?
- I can't answer that.

260
01:22:46,629 --> 01:22:48,329
- Why not?
- I told you.

261
01:22:48,629 --> 01:22:53,528
- But I don't understand.
- Ann, forget about the sex, you know? I...

262
01:22:56,329 --> 01:22:59,526
I'm not the same person that I was...
even remotely, you know.

263
01:22:59,828 --> 01:23:02,427
I'm different in so many ways.

264
01:23:02,627 --> 01:23:07,425
It'd have a profound effect on the way that
I relate to other people, communicate.

265
01:23:07,827 --> 01:23:12,526
This, for instance. The way she and I are
talking, it could never have been possible.

266
01:23:12,926 --> 01:23:16,224
"She"? "The way she...
she and I are talking"?

267
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:20,223
- "She"? Who's "she"?
- I'm sorry, I was...

268
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:25,425
- That isn't what I was...
- She's Elizabeth? Is that who it is?

269
01:23:25,824 --> 01:23:29,923
Is that the girl that John
talked about? Is that who it is?

270
01:23:36,122 --> 01:23:42,520
- I guess. I... I'm sorry.
- So, you're still in contact with her?

271
01:23:44,022 --> 01:23:45,922
- With Elizabeth?
- No. I'm...

272
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:50,420
What do you think Elizabeth
is gonna think about all these videotapes?

273
01:23:52,021 --> 01:23:55,519
I can't imagine her
bein' too understanding.

274
01:23:57,420 --> 01:24:01,918
But you're gonna tell her about them,
right, since you don't lie any more?

275
01:24:02,518 --> 01:24:08,017
As I said, I don't know
what I'm gonna do, exactly.

276
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:12,916
I mean... perhaps I won't do anything.

277
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:16,915
So, you just came back here
so that you could think about it?

278
01:24:17,117 --> 01:24:19,815
No, I moved back here for some...

279
01:24:24,116 --> 01:24:26,814
A sense of closure, you know?

280
01:24:31,214 --> 01:24:33,313
Resolution of some sort.

281
01:24:39,313 --> 01:24:46,211
I wanted somebody who was very
important to me to understand that.

282
01:24:48,212 --> 01:24:51,911
That's... That's pathetic.

283
01:24:55,812 --> 01:24:58,710
I mean, you can't just...
Oh, my God, Graham.

284
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:03,209
You just can't walk up to her
and show her you've changed

285
01:25:03,410 --> 01:25:05,808
like it's some gift or somethin'.

286
01:25:09,509 --> 01:25:11,408
And look what you've changed into.

287
01:25:14,009 --> 01:25:18,407
Nine years. Nine years.
And this is what you come up with.

288
01:25:20,507 --> 01:25:23,506
Is this what you wanna be
the rest of your life?

289
01:25:26,807 --> 01:25:29,105
Why are you doin' this?

290
01:25:30,506 --> 01:25:34,506
Can you tell me that?
Why are you doin' this to yourself?

291
01:25:38,005 --> 01:25:40,503
- Are you gonna answer me?
- Please, don't do that.

292
01:25:40,805 --> 01:25:42,604
- Why not?
- Don't do that.

293
01:25:42,803 --> 01:25:46,202
I wanna ask a few questions, like why
do you tape women talkin' about sex?

294
01:25:46,603 --> 01:25:49,102
Why do you do that?
Can you tell me why?

295
01:25:50,603 --> 01:25:52,802
Come on. I'm just gonna keep askin'.

296
01:25:53,103 --> 01:25:55,701
I don't find turning the tables
very interesting.

297
01:25:56,002 --> 01:25:58,901
Well, I do. Tell me why, Graham.

298
01:25:59,102 --> 01:26:00,802
- Why?
- What?

299
01:26:01,002 --> 01:26:04,801
What? What do you want me to tell you?
"Tell me why?" Why?

300
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:12,099
Ann, you don't even know who I am. You
don't have the slightest idea who I am.

301
01:26:14,399 --> 01:26:19,198
Am I supposed to recount all the points
in my life leading up to this moment

302
01:26:19,699 --> 01:26:23,297
and just hope that it's coherent,
that it makes some sort of sense to you?

303
01:26:23,798 --> 01:26:27,195
It doesn't make any sense to me.
You know, I was there.

304
01:26:27,997 --> 01:26:30,496
I don't have the slightest idea who I am,

305
01:26:30,697 --> 01:26:33,895
and I'm supposed
to be able to explain it to you?

306
01:26:34,596 --> 01:26:37,294
And why? You tell me why.

307
01:26:37,896 --> 01:26:40,195
Why do I have to explain myself to you?

308
01:26:40,497 --> 01:26:42,795
Because maybe I can help you.

309
01:26:44,196 --> 01:26:46,794
- Help me with what?
- Your problem.

310
01:26:48,294 --> 01:26:50,694
My problem? Do I have a problem?

311
01:26:51,495 --> 01:26:56,592
I look around me in this town and I see
John and Cynthia and you, and I...

312
01:26:58,393 --> 01:27:00,793
I feel comparatively healthy.

313
01:27:05,392 --> 01:27:07,491
You've got a problem.

314
01:27:11,891 --> 01:27:13,790
You're right.

315
01:27:20,690 --> 01:27:22,889
I've got a lot of problems.

316
01:27:31,089 --> 01:27:33,287
But they belong to me.

317
01:27:36,188 --> 01:27:39,486
You think they're yours, but they're not.

318
01:27:39,787 --> 01:27:43,786
Everybody that walks in that door
becomes part of your problem.

319
01:27:44,187 --> 01:27:47,285
Anybody that comes in contact with you.

320
01:27:50,286 --> 01:27:53,384
I didn't wanna be
part of your problem, but I am.

321
01:27:54,785 --> 01:27:56,884
I'm leavin' my husband,

322
01:27:56,984 --> 01:28:01,083
and maybe I would have anyway,
but the fact is that I'm doin' it now.

323
01:28:03,883 --> 01:28:06,382
And part of it's because of you.

324
01:28:12,182 --> 01:28:14,681
You've had an effect on my life.

325
01:28:19,882 --> 01:28:22,380
This isn't supposed to happen.

326
01:28:27,180 --> 01:28:31,779
I've spent nine years structuring my life
so that this didn't happen.

327
01:32:28,546 --> 01:32:32,445
You know, I never told you this,
cos I knew it'd crush you.

328
01:32:35,245 --> 01:32:37,245
But now...

329
01:32:38,245 --> 01:32:40,345
I fucked Elizabeth.

330
01:32:40,544 --> 01:32:44,543
Before you broke up.
Before you were havin' trouble, even.

331
01:32:47,643 --> 01:32:49,442
She's no saint.

332
01:32:49,544 --> 01:32:51,742
She was good in bed.

333
01:32:52,643 --> 01:32:54,942
She could keep a secret.

334
01:32:56,842 --> 01:32:59,340
That's about all I can say about her.

335
01:33:56,834 --> 01:34:00,332
- I gotta make a call.
- Yeah, sure.

336
01:34:02,432 --> 01:34:05,530
- Kirkland's office.
- John Millaney for Brian Kirkland.

337
01:34:05,832 --> 01:34:07,931
- Just one moment, please.
- All right.

338
01:34:08,132 --> 01:34:11,330
Anyway, as I've always said,
work is critical.

339
01:34:12,031 --> 01:34:17,530
I can be happy without a marriage, but if
you take away my work, that's different.

340
01:34:17,930 --> 01:34:21,829
And if Ann can't handle that...

341
01:34:24,029 --> 01:34:27,327
- Well, that's her problem.
- Mr Millaney?

342
01:34:27,629 --> 01:34:29,927
- Yeah.
- Mr DeForest would like to see you.

343
01:34:30,329 --> 01:34:32,427
All right. In a minute. I'm on with a client.

344
01:34:32,727 --> 01:34:36,626
- He said immediately.
- All right. Jesus.

345
01:34:36,827 --> 01:34:38,426
- Mr Millaney?
- Yeah?

346
01:34:38,628 --> 01:34:42,627
Mr Kirkland asked me to inform you
he's obtained representation elsewhere,

347
01:34:43,027 --> 01:34:46,224
and that if you have a message
for Mr Kirkland to leave it with me.

348
01:34:46,425 --> 01:34:48,425
Thank you. Um...

349
01:34:50,326 --> 01:34:52,225
- No message.
- All right, Mr Millaney.

350
01:34:52,525 --> 01:34:54,424
Thank you.

351
01:34:54,724 --> 01:34:56,223
Fool!

352
01:34:57,824 --> 01:34:59,824
Hope he knows what he's doin'.

353
01:35:00,325 --> 01:35:01,823
- Mr Millaney?
- Yeah?

354
01:35:02,124 --> 01:35:06,123
- Mr DeForest is waiting.
- All right. Tell him I'll be in in a minute.

355
01:35:06,423 --> 01:35:11,021
Jesus, the old man thinks that
the world revolves around a game of golf.

356
01:35:11,323 --> 01:35:14,620
I'll catch up to you at the courts.
I'd better go talk to DeForest.

357
01:35:14,823 --> 01:35:16,121
Sure.

358
01:35:17,221 --> 01:35:18,320
OK.

359
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,419
Fuck.

360
01:35:47,017 --> 01:35:49,416
Oh, no, just one's fine, thanks.

361
01:35:52,717 --> 01:35:54,816
This is my favourite part.

362
01:36:00,416 --> 01:36:03,414
You know, I was thinking we should
name our first child Rusty.

363
01:36:03,716 --> 01:36:06,014
What do you think of that name?

364
01:36:09,714 --> 01:36:14,912
OK. You know, I spend a lot of money in
here. I should at least know your name.

365
01:36:15,213 --> 01:36:17,213
- Hey.
- Hey.

366
01:36:18,313 --> 01:36:21,712
I brought you this.
I knew it was your birthday.

367
01:36:23,212 --> 01:36:27,111
- Thanks.
- It's a nice plant. Looks like a tablecloth.

368
01:36:32,211 --> 01:36:35,008
Look, I can't stay. I gotta go.

369
01:36:36,811 --> 01:36:39,509
- Can I call you?
- Do you have my work number?

370
01:36:39,710 --> 01:36:40,809
No.

371
01:36:42,809 --> 01:36:44,908
Got a pen?

372
01:36:49,009 --> 01:36:51,607
OK, now, you're wearing blue,
I'm wearing blue.

373
01:36:51,909 --> 01:36:54,507
Is this some sort of weird coincidence?

374
01:36:54,707 --> 01:36:57,905
I don't think so.
I think it's something more.

375
01:36:58,107 --> 01:37:01,504
- Do you live here?
- No. I'm just passing through.

376
01:37:04,806 --> 01:37:09,205
Look, don't call between three and five,
cos I get real busy, OK?

377
01:37:09,506 --> 01:37:11,504
- OK.
- OK.

378
01:37:12,405 --> 01:37:14,405
See ya.

379
01:37:14,605 --> 01:37:16,605
- Bye.
- Bye.

380
01:37:19,704 --> 01:37:23,803
I like her.
She's a very nice girl. Very nice.

381
01:37:36,001 --> 01:37:37,900
- Hi.
- Hey.

382
01:37:45,400 --> 01:37:47,400
I think it's gonna rain.

383
01:37:52,000 --> 01:37:53,999
It is raining.

384
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:56,698
Yeah.
