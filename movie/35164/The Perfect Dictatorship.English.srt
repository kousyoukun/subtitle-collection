00:04:34,483 --> 00:04:37,486
TELEVISION MEXICANA

20
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,635
Good evening, Colonel,
we were waiting for you.

21
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:02,845
Come in, please.

22
00:05:27,203 --> 00:05:29,704
Good evening, Colonel,
he is already waiting for you.

23
00:05:36,963 --> 00:05:39,589
Good evening Colonel,
please have a seat.

24
00:05:39,631 --> 00:05:40,715
Thank you, sir.

25
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:44,887
The President's Office
sent you these documents.

26
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:47,890
I was told it's 
an urgent matter.

27
00:05:50,392 --> 00:05:51,853
Excuse me, sir.

28
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,332
Ivana, could you ask Carlos
to come to my office, please?

29
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:15,293
<i>He's busy, Mr. Harman.</i>

30
00:06:15,918 --> 00:06:17,169
Get him in here.

31
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:18,628
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

32
00:06:22,841 --> 00:06:25,970
<i>-Compadre! </i>
<i>-Just look at what I have for you.</i>

33
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:28,055
<i>I'm so glad to see you.</i>

34
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:38,523
Good evening, Javier, this morning...

35
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,235
...at the headquarters
of the Federal Police...

36
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:44,113
...a group of drug dealers
was brought forward...

37
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:46,448
...they are known as "Los Bukis"
and the authorities presume...

38
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,993
...they are the main
operators of the Sinaloa cartel...

39
00:06:49,035 --> 00:06:50,535
...in the State of Mexico.

40
00:06:50,577 --> 00:06:54,040
As part of the investigation
a big arsenal was confiscated...

41
00:06:54,081 --> 00:06:56,042
...as well as an important
amount of drugs...

42
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,126
No, no no...

43
00:06:57,168 --> 00:07:00,087
Cut, cut, I'm sorry Laurita, but nobody...

44
00:07:00,129 --> 00:07:02,298
...is going to believe that
these thugs are the main operators...

45
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,549
...look at them, they look more like
serial killers, than capos... Lucy!

46
00:07:05,384 --> 00:07:06,218
Lucy!

47
00:07:06,928 --> 00:07:09,512
Call the guys from castings
and ask them to send other extras...

48
00:07:09,554 --> 00:07:11,182
...Don't try to fool me, you
use the same ones the last time.

49
00:07:14,601 --> 00:07:15,769
What's up, Ivana?

50
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:19,773
Pepe?

51
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,692
Yes, tell Mr. Harman
that I'm on my way.

52
00:07:23,027 --> 00:07:25,528
-I leave my life in your hands.
-Yes, sir.

53
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:28,199
Lucy, send me the report
when you're done.

54
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,492
-It better be good!
-Yes!

55
00:07:31,118 --> 00:07:33,620
<i>You know how the boss likes things done.</i>

56
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:36,665
<i>There's dough missing, Mazacote, </i>
<i>I clearly told you...</i>

57
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:38,500
<i>...what the deal was and you--</i>

58
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,087
The one in the suit is governor
Carmelo Vargas. And the other one?

59
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,422
With that look he's probably a drug lord...

60
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,966
...but the truth is I don't give a shit.

61
00:07:45,007 --> 00:07:48,427
He can be an entrepreneur,
a union leader, whatever you want.

62
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,636
What happened now?

63
00:07:49,678 --> 00:07:52,306
Didn't you hear what happened in the
President's office with the Ambassador?

64
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:54,976
Yes, I read about it on the internet,
apparently now Mexicans...

65
00:07:55,017 --> 00:07:57,144
...are better than blacks in everything.

66
00:07:57,186 --> 00:07:59,479
Luckily, only official media
covered the event.

67
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:02,066
The Presidential Guards
confiscated the recording...

68
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,734
...but it's all over the social networks.

69
00:08:04,776 --> 00:08:07,570
And since Mister President,
is scare to death...

70
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,699
...about his approval ratings
he wants us to oversell this...

71
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:12,867
...to hide his own personal scandal.

72
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:14,869
But don't the President
and Governor Vargas...

73
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,496
...belong to the same party?
Why him?

74
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:18,915
Simply bad luck.

75
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,127
According to the 
Secretary of the Interior...

76
00:08:21,168 --> 00:08:23,379
...this is the worst they could get.

77
00:08:23,712 --> 00:08:26,382
So we are doing a "Chinese Box" operation.

78
00:08:26,715 --> 00:08:27,882
That's right.

79
00:08:28,259 --> 00:08:30,802
We really fucked up putting
this clown as president...

80
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,221
...but what's done is done.

81
00:08:32,263 --> 00:08:34,390
We have to deal with it.

82
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:37,018
Fix it the best you can.

83
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,811
Take it to the editorial department
so they can add more punch to it.

84
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,231
You are authorized to
spin it however you want...

85
00:08:42,273 --> 00:08:44,275
...but I want this as the main story.

86
00:08:44,316 --> 00:08:46,152
-Yes, Sir.
-Carlitos...

87
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,487
...look...

88
00:08:48,737 --> 00:08:50,989
...you already fucked up
when people found out...

89
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:52,741
...about that soccer deal...

90
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,744
...and the network can 
overlook one mistake...

91
00:08:57,079 --> 00:08:58,205
...but not two.

92
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,042
So don't fuck it this time, OK?

93
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,584
Yes, sir.

94
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:29,569
Good night.
Good night.

Good evening, following up
on tonight's story...

128
00:11:01,537 --> 00:11:03,330
...this afternoon these exclusive...

129

...images were sent 
anonymously to our offices...

130
00:11:05,624 --> 00:11:07,959
...were it appears that
Governor Carmelo Vargas...

131
00:11:08,001 --> 00:11:10,588
...is in the midst of a
deal that looks like...

132
00:11:10,629 --> 00:11:12,631
...one of the most outrageous cases...

133
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:15,675
...of corruption due to 
organized crime in recent years.

134

00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,287
Just look at the governor's
cynicism and shamelessness.

157
00:12:25,329 --> 00:12:27,248
The way his eyes light up...

158
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,667
...when he finds out what
is in the briefcases...

159
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,669
...and the obscene and 
insolent way that he caresses...

160
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:36,340
...the bills, that who knows
where they come from.

161
00:12:36,507 --> 00:12:37,716
Please.

162
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,761
Pay attention to detail and be the judge.

163
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:54,650
<i>Look compadre, I'm opening </i>
<i>an account in my niece's name...</i>

164
00:12:54,692 --> 00:12:56,360
<i>...and I want you to deposit </i>
<i>the other million.</i>

165
00:12:56,402 --> 00:12:57,235
<i>Done.</i>

166
00:13:00,406 --> 00:13:01,239
Yes?

167
00:13:02,533 --> 00:13:04,993
Sir, it's for you.

168
00:13:05,536 --> 00:13:07,829
Yes, what is it, Ivana?

169
00:13:09,707 --> 00:13:11,542
Is it him, or one of his minions?

170
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:14,712
Tell him to wait and he can go on live.

171
00:13:15,754 --> 00:13:17,631
That's the Governor
Carlitos, you're up.

172
00:13:18,006 --> 00:13:20,634
Javier, the governor is on the hook,
he'll be on with you after the video.

173
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,844
How much heat do you want me
to put on him?

174
00:13:23,762 --> 00:13:26,097
Enough so that he can dig
his own grave, Javier...

175
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:27,683
-...I'll leave it in your hands.
-Sure.

176
00:13:30,394 --> 00:13:31,687
Do you have the call?

177
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:34,398
I'm told that we have
Governor Vargas on the line.

178
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:37,568
<i>Mr. Governor, good evening. </i>
Thanks for calling.

179
00:13:37,609 --> 00:13:40,862
<i>Good evening Javier, </i>
<i>and thanks for the opportunity...</i>

180
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:44,408
<i>...to clarify to your audience </i>
<i>this regretful situation.</i>

181
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:46,075
Mr. Governor with all due respect...

182
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:49,580
...don't you find it shameful having
been exposed like this?

183
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:52,248
In something that leaves
no doubt as to your behavior...

184
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:54,000
...that, I don't know if it's illegal.

185
00:13:54,042 --> 00:13:57,086
But it's certainly immoral.

186
00:13:57,128 --> 00:13:59,881
<i>Well, first of all,  </i>
<i>I would like to clarify...</i>

187
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,426
<i>...it's not entirely clear that...</i>

188
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:04,386
<i>...the person in that video is me.</i>

189
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:07,180
<i>And secondly, I don't know...</i>

190
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,183
<i>...where this malicious lie is coming from.</i>

191
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,561
<i>It's not hard to imagine my enemies...</i>

192
00:14:12,603 --> 00:14:15,104
<i>...using your prestigious channel...</i>

193
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:17,816
<i>...to launch a smear campaign--</i>

194
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,984
Sorry to interrupt you Governor, but...

195
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:22,654
...I find your accusation 
to be very serious.

196
00:14:22,696 --> 00:14:25,198
I honestly don't think anybody
can seriously doubt...

197
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,242
...that you are the person in that video...

198
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,412
<i>...but nevertheless, </i>
<i>that is also your voice...</i>

199
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:33,289
...and that use of language 
that defines you.

200
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:36,334
<i>No, no, no Javier, </i>
<i>it's not that I am doubting you...</i>

201
00:14:36,377 --> 00:14:39,755
<i>...and I apologize, </i>
<i>but you know better than myself...</i>

202
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:42,006
<i>...that with all these new technologies...</i>

203
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,216
Mr. Governor...

204
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:45,719
...again, with all due respect,
and so as not to insult...

205
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,805
...our viewer's intelligence...

206
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,641
...I beg that you don't use
such a cheap way out...

207
00:14:50,682 --> 00:14:52,141
...to justify yourself.

208
00:14:52,684 --> 00:14:54,728
What we would expect to see...

209
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:57,021
...instead of more cynicism
is a clear and convincing...

210
00:14:57,063 --> 00:14:59,608
...explanation of this
embarrassing circumstance...

211
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:03,069
...and as always, our microphones
will always be available.

212
00:15:03,111 --> 00:15:04,822
-Good evening.
<i>-Good evening and...</i>

213
00:15:04,863 --> 00:15:07,866
<i>-...thank you for the opportunity-- </i>
-How may times have I said this before?

214
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,992
No matter the color, or the party...

215
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:11,662
...they are all the same.

216
00:15:12,328 --> 00:15:13,955
Please join us and participate...

217
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,749
<i>...in today's question.</i>

218
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,334
<i>Do you think Governor Vargas should quit?</i>

219
00:15:19,545 --> 00:15:21,713
<i>Call and let us know.</i>

220
00:15:22,296 --> 00:15:25,383
<i>Sons of bitches!</i>

221
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:28,429
They think they own the country!

222
00:15:30,012 --> 00:15:31,180
Of course...

223
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,392
...the fuckers put their 
puppet in Los Pinos...

224
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:38,062
...and they think they can fuck with me.

225
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:45,111
OK, sons of bitches, what are we
going to do to fix this...

226
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,781
...and still be in the race for the Chair?

227
00:15:47,823 --> 00:15:51,284
Sir, with all due respect,
I would keep insisting...

228
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:54,412
-...that it's all a conspiracy.
-Don't be naive, Oscar.

229
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:58,416
Not even my late wife,
who was even dumber than you...

230
00:15:58,459 --> 00:16:00,001
...would believe that story.

231
00:16:01,252 --> 00:16:03,379
What about you?
Any ideas, Poncho?

232
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:06,090
The truth is Sir, we have to accept...

233
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,843
...that they caught us with our pants down.

234
00:16:07,885 --> 00:16:11,137
I've already spoken with a friend in the
TV station, they have more videos...

235
00:16:11,179 --> 00:16:13,306
...to continue with this story
for a whole week.

236
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,517
I don't think our administration
can withstand a scandal...

237
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:17,853
-...of this magnitude.
- Fuck me!

238
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,731
All because of the ass holes who put...

239
00:16:20,772 --> 00:16:24,317
-...these fucking cameras up.
-They've already shut down the system...

240
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,277
...and will remove them tomorrow, Sir.

241
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:29,197
What's fucked up is that
we have a rat here.

242
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:32,951
As soon as we find out
who leaked those videos...

243
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:36,204
...we'll cut his balls off.
OK, now what?

244
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:39,081
Godfather, if I were you I'd talk
to the guys at the Network...

245
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:40,249
...and requested a truce.

246
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,461
You want me to kiss their asses?
Are you fucking stupid, Poncho?

247
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:45,379
Not to compare, but
remember what happened...

248
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,256
...to your colleagues, "El Chueco"
and "The Precious Governor"...

249
00:16:47,298 --> 00:16:48,926
...for not negotiating with
the Network when they could.

250
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:52,094
Wanting to fuck with 
my Precious Governor...

251
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:54,055
...only because he likes them young.

252
00:16:55,348 --> 00:16:58,017
Bad news, Godfather.
The press is after you.

253
00:17:03,607 --> 00:17:07,778
<i>-Murderer! </i>
<i>-See how the people hate you.</i>

254
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:11,489
<i>You're corrupt, </i>
<i>you'll pay for your wrongs.</i>

255
00:17:11,532 --> 00:17:14,618
<i>Thief! Thief! </i>
<i>Murderer!</i>

256
00:17:16,452 --> 00:17:19,540
There he is again, that fucking "Messiah"...

257
00:17:19,581 --> 00:17:20,999
...with all those followers.

258
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,463
Fuck it.

259
00:17:27,505 --> 00:17:29,925
Will have to suck up to the Network.

260
00:17:29,967 --> 00:17:32,886
Have my airplane ready
first thing in the morning.

261
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,972
Oh, and just in case.

262
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,849
Have that dumbshit at finance
prepare three million for me...

263
00:17:38,099 --> 00:17:39,100
...in case I need them.

264
00:17:41,269 --> 00:17:43,897
<i>Before we move on to </i>
<i>our news summary...</i>

265
00:17:43,939 --> 00:17:46,274
<i>...here are the results </i>
<i>of our telephone survey...</i>

266
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:47,275
<i>...to the question:</i>

00:17:47,316 --> 00:17:49,570
<i>Do you think </i>
<i>Governor Vargas should resign?</i>

268
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:52,405
<i>He should immediately resign, 91%</i>

269
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:55,116
<i>He shouldn't resign, 6%</i>

270

<i>Didn't I tell you, Carlitos...</i>

271
00:18:05,126 --> 00:18:07,169
...they all bought the story 
and they left out...

272

...the news of the President
and the Ambassador...

273
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:12,466
...from the front page.
Some didn't even mention it.

274
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:15,012
The fucking "Chinese Box" never fails.

275
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,514
They called from the President's office,
to thank us.

276
00:18:18,849 --> 00:18:20,474
-Congratulations.
-Thanks, Pepe.

277
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:22,728
How was the rating
during the Governor's story?

278
00:18:22,936 --> 00:18:24,145
22 points.

279
00:18:24,605 --> 00:18:27,273
Although you might have been a bit
heavy handed calling him a narc.

280
00:18:27,315 --> 00:18:29,233
Hopefully he won't sue us
and we find out that the cure...

281
00:18:29,275 --> 00:18:30,777
...is more expensive than the disease.

282
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:32,528
Come on, you don't think he's a narc?

283
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:41,579
<i>This news confirms my argument...</i>

284
00:18:41,913 --> 00:18:44,875
<i>...that Governor Carmelo </i>
<i>Vargas' campaign...</i>

285
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,753
<i>...was financed with dirty money.</i>

286
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,757
<i>And confirms the thesis </i>
<i>I had during all this time.</i>

287
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,301
<i>Mexican governors, besides acting...</i>

288
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:56,552
<i>...like Viceroys...</i>

00:18:56,594 --> 00:18:59,180
<i>...are in bed with organised crime.</i>

290

That's all we needed.

291
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,478
The fucking jackals 
with the same bullshit.

292
00:19:05,729 --> 00:19:08,815
TV is full of vultures and hyenas.

293
00:19:09,816 --> 00:19:12,819
Godfather, I don't want to bother
you with more bad news, but...

294
00:19:12,986 --> 00:19:15,404
...the scandal theme is
all over the social networks.

295

<i>Governor Quit and Lord Of Briefcases...</i>

...are Trending Topics.

297
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,663
Also, all 8 columns

299

"Tending Tropic", myballs.com

302
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,048

305

-...listen to.
- You're right, Godfather.

306
00:19:41,098 --> 00:19:43,432
That's why I beg you,
let me lead the negotiation.

307
00:19:43,725 --> 00:19:45,060
Did you bring the money?

308
00:19:45,309 --> 00:19:47,353
González put in a couple more million...

309
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,897
...in case the things get rough.

310
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:52,025
You'll see how quickly we'll
straighten this thing up, Poncho.

311
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,236
Not even those fuckers at the TV Network
can resist an offer like this.

312
00:20:06,414 --> 00:20:09,000
My apologies for being late.

313
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,129
Ok, Mr. Governor...

314
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,672
...how can we help you?

315
00:20:17,092 --> 00:20:19,218
Isn't Don Alejandro joining us?

316
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,055
Sorry Don Carmelo, but
Don Alejandro had to attend...

317
00:20:22,097 --> 00:20:24,725
...an urgent meeting, but he said
he would stop by and say hi...

318
00:20:24,766 --> 00:20:26,225
...if he got here on time.
Please, have a seat.

319
00:20:27,518 --> 00:20:28,519
Well...

320
00:20:29,855 --> 00:20:31,605
...as you know, Don Jose...

321
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:33,775
...where I come from
we are very straightforward.

322
00:20:33,817 --> 00:20:35,736
And I don't like to beat around the bush...

323
00:20:36,111 --> 00:20:39,447
...what happened last night,
was a low blow.

324
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,867
Look, I'm very sorry, but you know...

325
00:20:41,908 --> 00:20:44,161
...that our obligations 
are to our audience...

326
00:20:44,202 --> 00:20:45,996
...and above all, to the truth.

327
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,248
If you like, you can take this up...

328
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:50,624
...in a court of law, 
you are entitled to do so.

329
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,919
No, no Don Jose, it's not about that.

330
00:20:53,419 --> 00:20:56,297
But don't tell me there isn't
another way to deal with this.

331
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:58,800
To hit me like that
without a fair warning.

332
00:20:58,842 --> 00:21:01,552
-Not even a "Watch out".
-As I said, I am very sorry.

333
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,014
But our editorial policies...

334
00:21:04,055 --> 00:21:06,057
...and our ethical and moral code...

335
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,185
...are very strict and 
we can't do otherwise.

336
00:21:08,226 --> 00:21:10,896
Look Don Jose. As one of my
father's friends used to say...

337
00:21:10,937 --> 00:21:13,397
...morals are overrated...

338
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:14,983
...and they aren't worth a shit.

339
00:21:15,566 --> 00:21:18,444
You know I've been doing this
"politicking" for many years.

340
00:21:18,904 --> 00:21:22,281
And to speed things up,
I brought you a little something...

341
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:25,743
...so we can cut the crap
and turn over a new leaf.

342
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:27,453
What do you think?

343
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,209
I'm sorry Don Carmelo, but
I'm not sure I understand...

344
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,459
...exactly what you mean by this.

345
00:21:34,293 --> 00:21:36,087
-Let's see, Oscar.
-Yes, sir.

346
00:21:47,182 --> 00:21:49,558
Mr. Governor, with all due respect...

347
00:21:50,936 --> 00:21:53,188
...and as a courtesy for being our guest...

348
00:21:53,230 --> 00:21:54,730
...we are going to ignore your offer.

349
00:21:55,023 --> 00:21:57,150
If you want to make
a donation to our Foundation...

350
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:59,027
...you can do it directly with our bank.

351
00:22:00,904 --> 00:22:03,739
No, no, no, don't get me wrong Don Jose...

352
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:07,535
...of course this money is
for your Foundation.

353
00:22:08,954 --> 00:22:10,788
How could you think otherwise?

354
00:22:11,289 --> 00:22:13,374
Well then, thanks for your generosity.

355
00:22:14,084 --> 00:22:15,085
Ivana?

356
00:22:26,762 --> 00:22:28,306
Yes, sir?

357
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,976
Ivana, the Governor has brought us...

358
00:22:31,017 --> 00:22:33,686
...this donation, please
make out a receipt to his name...

359
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:34,812
...and give it to him when he leaves.

360
00:22:34,855 --> 00:22:37,148
Of course.
It will be my pleasure.

361
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:40,484
Excuse me.

362
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,536
May I have a word, Godfather?

363
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,916
Look Pepe, as you can see
we currently have...

364
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:56,500
...an image problem in our State.

365
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,253
The Governor has done a great job.

366
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,504
But our rivals are relentless
with their criticism...

367
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:02,590
...and news like yesterday's to be honest...

368
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:05,260
...are not helping much.
We're here to hire...

369
00:23:05,426 --> 00:23:08,096
...a marketing scheme,
political image consultancy...

370
00:23:08,138 --> 00:23:10,556
...and publicity, just like the ones
you have offered to other governors.

371
00:23:11,057 --> 00:23:13,894
Well, you should have
started with that, my friend.

372
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,979
You know this is a business...

373
00:23:16,021 --> 00:23:18,522
...and as such we are accountable...

374
00:23:18,564 --> 00:23:20,108
...to our share holders.

375
00:23:20,150 --> 00:23:21,817
-Yes, that's right.
-Exactly.

376
00:23:22,068 --> 00:23:23,736
And for our governmental clients...

377
00:23:23,777 --> 00:23:25,404
...such as yourselves, we have come up...

378
00:23:25,696 --> 00:23:28,741
...with various combinations of
consultancy and product positioning.

379
00:23:29,326 --> 00:23:31,452
But honestly, given your situation...

380
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:33,787
...I would suggest we go straight...

381
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,290
...to our Premium plan.

382
00:23:36,457 --> 00:23:39,127
And what is this plan about?

383
00:23:39,668 --> 00:23:41,795
Well, in a nutshell, and to avoid...

384
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:43,381
...bogging down on details...

385
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:46,508
...you direct 3% of 
federal participations...

386
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:48,970
...and 50% of all your media budget...

387
00:23:49,012 --> 00:23:50,221
...to our Network.

388
00:23:50,512 --> 00:23:53,515
We provide advice and positioning...

389
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,559
...and a fixed number of prime time spots.

390
00:23:56,518 --> 00:23:57,938
And most importantly...

391
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:00,439
...political crisis management...

392
00:24:00,814 --> 00:24:02,650
...such as the one
you are currently suffering.

393
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,777
Sorry to interrupt, Don Jose.

394
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,904
But you are talking
a shitload of money here.

395
00:24:07,405 --> 00:24:11,201
Only of federal participations we're
talking more than 20 M, we'd...

396
00:24:11,242 --> 00:24:13,744
-...have to mortgage the s--
-Oscar.

397
00:24:14,536 --> 00:24:17,123
Mr. Governor, may I remind you, 
that there...

398
00:24:17,374 --> 00:24:19,167
...are certain things 
that money can't buy...

399
00:24:19,209 --> 00:24:21,962
...and I think your political career
is worth much more than that.

400
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,589
You are right, Don Jose.

401
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:28,051
I'll just need to ask a favor.

402
00:24:28,759 --> 00:24:30,428
Anything Governor.

403
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,846
Just as you pulled it off
in the last administration...

404
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:33,722
...with the "Golden Boy"...

405
00:24:34,432 --> 00:24:37,352
...I would appreciate 
you do the same for me...

406
00:24:37,394 --> 00:24:39,020
...putting me on the presidential race.

407
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:41,563
With all due respect,
Mr. Governor...

408
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,732
...but I don't think you know
what you're talking about.

409
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:45,776
For that, you would
have to mortgage the state.

410
00:24:46,027 --> 00:24:48,862
But look, here's what we can do.
Let's proceed with this.

411
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:51,615
And in the near future,
if we are both happy with this...

412
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:53,701
...we'll sit down and talk
and see where we're at. Sounds good?

413
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,578
No, Don Jose,
I want the whole package.

414
00:24:57,122 --> 00:24:58,747
Don't you worry about the money.

415
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:01,251
My great State can give that,
and much more.

416
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:06,297
Don Jose, my future is in your hands.

417
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,385
Imagine this dipslut...

418
00:25:10,427 --> 00:25:12,053
...really believes he can be President.

419
00:25:12,636 --> 00:25:14,347
We are talking about, what?

420
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:16,474
300 million dollars?

421
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:18,559
You really are a bad ass at business...

422
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,561
...I really have so much to learn still.

423
00:25:24,107 --> 00:25:26,608
Pepe, please don't send me.

424
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,071
It's the first time that
I'm heading the news section and...

425
00:25:30,113 --> 00:25:33,324
-...I wouldn't want to lose this chance.
-Don't be stupid, Carlitos.

426
00:25:33,366 --> 00:25:35,659
You're forgetting that you
brought in our client.

427
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:38,537
Besides, I'm not asking
for your opinion, asshole...

428
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:39,580
...I'm giving you an order.

429
00:25:49,006 --> 00:25:52,093
Look, if it all works out...

430
00:25:52,843 --> 00:25:55,513
...and you convince this son of a bitch
to mortgage his State...

431
00:25:56,013 --> 00:25:58,724
...I might not only offer you
the news director job...

432
00:25:58,766 --> 00:26:00,976
...but the News Vice-presidency.

433
00:26:02,853 --> 00:26:04,230
The Vice-presidency?

434
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:08,526
You go to the State, 
you let things cool down...

435
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,653
...you make a couple of interviews,
you program some special reports...

436
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:13,655
...with Javier, and to make
you stop whining...

437
00:26:14,324 --> 00:26:17,118
...I'll send our star reporter,
what do you think?

438
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:20,205
The thing is, that State is full
of drug dealers and murderers.

439
00:26:20,246 --> 00:26:22,248
Forget about anything related to violence.

440
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:24,833
Remember we signed an agreement...

441
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,503
...to improve this country's image.

442
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:27,628
Well, OK...

443
00:26:28,463 --> 00:26:30,047
...I'll see what I can
come up with on my way there...

444
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,632
...to help that motherfucker save face.

445
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,094
That's the spirit.

446
00:26:40,475 --> 00:26:41,309
Here.

447
00:26:41,518 --> 00:26:43,436
For your expenses, get to work.

448
00:26:53,070 --> 00:26:58,700
POOR PEOPLE ALSO LOVE

449
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,552
<i>What did you decide, Jazmin?</i>

450
00:27:17,262 --> 00:27:19,264
<i>We can't be together.</i>

451
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,184
<i>Our love is not enough </i>
<i>to erase our differences...</i>

452
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:24,394
<i>-...Rafael... </i>
<i>-Jazmin...</i>

453
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,354
<i>...there are no differences </i>
<i>between you and me.</i>

454
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:29,064
<i>It's time you knew the truth.</i>

455
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,234
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

456
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:33,819
<i>You're not a simple maid.</i>

457
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:37,157
<i>Don Leonardo de la Garza...</i>

458
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,700
<i>...has confessed he is  </i>
<i>your biological father.</i>

459
00:27:39,992 --> 00:27:41,702
<i>He's named you his heiress.</i>

460
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,372
<i>There is nothing that separates us now.</i>

461
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,082
<i>Rafael.</i>

462
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,217
<i>Rafael Lascurain, what are </i>
<i>you doing with that filthy maid?</i>

463
00:28:10,565 --> 00:28:12,275
POOR PEOPLE LOVE TOO

464
00:28:16,153 --> 00:28:19,156
Hey, do you know how many
rating points your soap opera has?

465
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:21,158
I would imagine quite a few.

466
00:28:21,409 --> 00:28:23,160
They added 50 new episodes.

467
00:28:24,161 --> 00:28:27,373
And my character will get sexier.

468
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,376
28 points and still rising.

469
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,504
There is no doubt that 
our bosses are geniuses.

470
00:28:33,546 --> 00:28:36,048
That's exactly why I have to
make a good impression on Pepe.

471
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,552
Imagine I get the Vice-presidency.

472
00:28:45,807 --> 00:28:46,808
Hey...

473
00:28:47,184 --> 00:28:49,061
-...how long will you be away for?
-I don't know...

474
00:28:49,102 --> 00:28:50,771
...maybe a week, maybe more.

475
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:00,030
Wait, wait...

476
00:29:04,868 --> 00:29:06,454
Good evening General, how are you?

477
00:29:07,204 --> 00:29:09,415
Everything is fine,
did you get my message?

478
00:29:10,667 --> 00:29:11,792
OK.

479
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,378
Just so you know...

480
00:29:13,419 --> 00:29:15,045
...I might need you for a job.

481
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:17,674
Thanks.

482
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,091
Good evening.

483
00:29:20,968 --> 00:29:23,845
-Is everything OK, honey?
-Everything OK, princess.

484
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:26,474
I need you for another type of job.

485
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,836
Just look at this place.

486
00:29:59,881 --> 00:30:01,551
According to what I've been reading...

487
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:03,636
...our Governor's state,
places last in almost everything...

488
00:30:03,678 --> 00:30:06,472
...health, education, 
economic development.

489
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:09,600
If you knew what I get to see
in the countries they send me...

490
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:12,185
...to report, you would know
that this is heaven.

491
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:15,105
Wait till you meet the Governor,
he's not unlike an African dictator.

492
00:30:15,523 --> 00:30:18,651
I saw the interview with Javier
and I thought he was great...

493
00:30:18,693 --> 00:30:20,902
...his insolence, claiming 
that it wasn't him.

494
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:23,364
It's good that Javier cut 
the interview short.

495
00:30:23,656 --> 00:30:27,368
Carlos, don't take it the wrong way
but I think it's time for Javier...

496
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,038
...and the news team to retire,
don't you think?

497
00:30:32,289 --> 00:30:34,207
They could've done so much more.

498
00:30:34,542 --> 00:30:36,544
Excuse me Ricardo, but I think you're wrong.

499
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:38,504
Javier is an institution.

500
00:30:38,755 --> 00:30:40,673
Our viewers blindly believe
everything he says...

501
00:30:40,715 --> 00:30:43,343
...he's a pillar for the political system.

502
00:30:43,676 --> 00:30:45,595
But he's too old fashioned, 
he thinks that...

503
00:30:45,636 --> 00:30:47,137
...newspapers are still 
read on actual paper.

504
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,807
Maybe you're right,
but there is a small detail.

505
00:30:50,725 --> 00:30:52,560
The boss loves him like an uncle.

506
00:30:53,728 --> 00:30:56,564
So I would suggest you stay out of this one.

507
00:30:58,023 --> 00:31:00,317
OK, so what are this State's highlights?

508
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:03,862
You mean, you've never been here?

509
00:31:03,904 --> 00:31:06,657
No, I only travel to places
where I need my passport, man.

510
00:31:09,827 --> 00:31:12,455
Look, there is your highlight.

511
00:31:14,749 --> 00:31:17,418
Fuck sake Carlos!

512
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,336
Ramon, tell the convoy that we are stopping.

513
00:31:19,379 --> 00:31:20,463
We are going to shoot, are you ready?

514
00:31:20,505 --> 00:31:21,338
Yes, of course.

515
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,591
THIS WILL HAPPEN TO ANYBODY
WHO CROSSES THE LINE

516
00:31:23,633 --> 00:31:24,842
SIGNED EL MAZACOTE CARTEL

517
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:27,804
Take that there, under the sign.

518
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,685
Let's go!

519
00:31:35,561 --> 00:31:36,396
Carlos!

520
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,242
Is there a problem, sir?

521
00:31:50,785 --> 00:31:52,620
What brings you out here, guys?

522
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:56,331
We are from Television Mexicana,
we are here covering a story...

523
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:58,418
From the TV, right.

524
00:31:59,419 --> 00:32:01,421
You think I'm blind, cowboy?

525
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:05,006
Get against the vehicle.
We are going to search you.

526
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,676
Sorry, we have a meeting with--

527
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:10,137
Look, you either do what you're told
or I'll make you do it.

528
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:11,930
Is that clear?
Is that clear?

529
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:15,100
And if one of you steps out of line.
I'll fuck you all.

530
00:32:17,394 --> 00:32:19,814
-So let's behave, shall we?
-Yes, I'll shut my mouth.

531
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:25,653
<i>What's happening "Mapache"?</i>

532
00:32:26,236 --> 00:32:28,947
Boss, I have here some
dudes from Television Mexicana...

533
00:32:28,989 --> 00:32:30,616
...they say they are here
to work with the Governor.

534
00:32:31,116 --> 00:32:34,787
<i>Yes, that's clear, just let  </i>
<i>those bastards know...</i>

535
00:32:34,829 --> 00:32:36,037
<i>...that if they air another  </i>
<i>one of those videos...</i>

536
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,080
<i>...like the one from the other day...</i>

537
00:32:37,122 --> 00:32:39,166
<i>...we are going to fucking </i>
<i>teach them a lesson, is that clear?</i>

538
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,668
Yes, boss.

539
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,711
OK then.

540
00:32:43,463 --> 00:32:46,883
OK assholes, my boss
spoke to the Governors' staff...

541
00:32:46,924 --> 00:32:48,509
...and it seems everything is in order.

542
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:52,262
But my boss sends a message.

543
00:32:52,847 --> 00:32:55,516
If you pull off something similar
to what you did the other day...

544
00:32:55,558 --> 00:32:58,018
...like airing that video
on TV with the Governor.

545
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,353
We are going to have 
to teach you a lesson...

546
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,022
...that you won't forget, motherfuckers.

547
00:33:02,272 --> 00:33:03,691
-Yes, sir.
-OK?

548
00:33:03,733 --> 00:33:04,609
Yes, sir.

549
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,779
-Hey, Ricardo, Ricardo, Ricardo...
-Get in, get in.

550
00:33:08,821 --> 00:33:10,405
Can you take a picture with us?

551
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:12,032
Of course!

552
00:33:12,282 --> 00:33:13,701
It's just that my mom...

553
00:33:13,743 --> 00:33:15,368
...my mom is your fan, dude...

554
00:33:15,786 --> 00:33:17,663
...and I'm sure she's going to love this.

555
00:33:17,705 --> 00:33:19,456
-Take a picture of us, whitey.
-Yes.

556
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:22,250
Come on motherfuckers, 
the picture. The picture!

557
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,462
-Careful.
-Don't get in my way.

558
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,521
Don't tell me there wasn't
another hotel, Alfonso.

559
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:44,732
Even in the shittiest city in Africa
there is a five star Hilton.

560
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:46,859
Look Ricardo, the thing is this hotel...

561
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:48,861
...is the Governor's brother
and we have a cooperation...

562
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:50,278
-...agreement.
-The Governor...

563
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,907
...is very sorry about 
what happened on the highway...

564
00:33:52,949 --> 00:33:55,367
...and he prepared a celebration,
to welcome you.

565
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,578
Look, I don't want to seem rude,
General Attorney, but we need...

566
00:33:57,620 --> 00:34:00,372
...to settle in and get to work
there will be time to celebrate later.

567
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:02,708
Well I truly hope our Governor
doesn't take this the wrong way.

568
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,168
He had already invited some
friends and girls...

569
00:34:05,210 --> 00:34:06,546
...to introduce to you.

570
00:34:07,254 --> 00:34:10,298
Listen, I need you to organize
tomorrow morning a meeting...

571
00:34:10,340 --> 00:34:12,552
...with all his staff we need
to come up with the strategy...

572
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:14,637
...I also need all the information
you can get on the State...

573
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:17,055
...pictures, videos, reports, statistics...

574
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,725
...anything that can help us
compare the State...

575
00:34:19,767 --> 00:34:22,102
...with the current 
administration and before...

576
00:34:22,143 --> 00:34:23,311
...and show off all the work he's done.

577
00:34:23,353 --> 00:34:26,023
New schools, new hospitals, new roads...

578
00:34:26,064 --> 00:34:27,650
...anything that makes him look good...

579
00:34:27,692 --> 00:34:28,943
...will be crucial to pull this off.

580
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,695
I can get you all you need, but...

581
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,781
Don't expect anything extraordinary.

582
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:37,034
Once more, I apologize for
what happened in the highway...

583
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,494
...I already ordered a police escort
to take care of you.

584
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,079
Thanks a lot.

585
00:34:41,121 --> 00:34:42,372
-Don Carlos.
-General Attorney.

586
00:34:42,623 --> 00:34:44,374
You have my phone, please
let me know anything you need.

587
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,458
Thank you, Ponce.

588
00:34:46,836 --> 00:34:47,670
Ready, Sir.

589
00:34:47,962 --> 00:34:50,338
-Can I have Mr. Diaz' also?
-Sure.

590
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:00,975
I'm coming.

591
00:35:11,568 --> 00:35:13,111
Don Carlos Rojo?

592
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:16,531
-Yes.
-Good evening, Don Carlos.

593
00:35:16,573 --> 00:35:18,408
Sorry to stop by unannounced...

594
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:20,201
...but I heard of your arrival here...

595
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,162
...and I urgently needed to contact you.

596
00:35:22,955 --> 00:35:24,624
Tell me, how can I help you?

597
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,667
My name is Agustin Morales.

598
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:30,253
I'm the opposition leader
in the State Congress.

599
00:35:31,588 --> 00:35:33,465
Tell me Congressman, 
what can I do for you?

600
00:35:33,758 --> 00:35:35,092
May I come in?

601
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:38,553
I want to speak to you
about a very delicate matter.

602
00:35:40,597 --> 00:35:42,515
-Please, come on in.
-Thank you.

603
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,893
Please excuse the mess...

604
00:35:43,934 --> 00:35:45,477
...but we're barely settling in.

605
00:35:46,603 --> 00:35:48,146
Please, have a seat.

606
00:35:48,188 --> 00:35:50,607
Thank you, you are very kind.

607
00:35:51,025 --> 00:35:53,027
I promise I'll be brief.

608
00:35:57,114 --> 00:35:58,115
I'm all ears.

609
00:35:58,615 --> 00:36:01,326
First of all, I would like to
thank the great contribution...

610
00:36:01,368 --> 00:36:03,746
...of your Network, to democracy...

611
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:06,666
...and the search for justice
that I am heading in this State.

612
00:36:06,707 --> 00:36:08,793
Sorry Congressman, I'm not sure I follow.

613
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,711
When I sent the video
to the President's office...

614
00:36:10,878 --> 00:36:12,587
...to denounce Vargas's corruption...

615
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:15,423
...I never imagined it would end
up on National TV.

616
00:36:15,883 --> 00:36:18,135
And that it would have the impact it had.

617
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,097
-You send the video?
-That's right, Don Carlos.

618
00:36:21,638 --> 00:36:24,141
It seems like finally this President...

619
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,143
...wants to end corruption.

620
00:36:26,476 --> 00:36:28,979
The coverage that you provided
in your broadcasts...

621
00:36:29,021 --> 00:36:31,941
...has been a trigger
for our people to open their eyes...

622
00:36:31,982 --> 00:36:34,401
...to finally rid ourselves
of the mafia that are ruling...

623
00:36:34,442 --> 00:36:37,947
...our State, headed by that cynic Vargas.

624
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:40,741
There is nothing to thank we are doing it...

625
00:36:40,783 --> 00:36:42,159
...merely out of journalistic interest.

626
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,704
Besides thanking you in person...

627
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:47,957
...I also came to invite you
to be an honor witness to our...

628
00:36:47,998 --> 00:36:50,500
...session in Congress tomorrow,
where we expect to make history.

629
00:36:50,918 --> 00:36:53,003
We will ask for the Governor's resignation.

630
00:36:54,088 --> 00:36:55,881
You are asking for the 
Governor's resignation?

631
00:36:56,506 --> 00:36:58,718
I'm sure that your presence,
will not only be an honor...

632
00:36:58,759 --> 00:37:00,803
...but will be a factor 
to achieve this goal.

633
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,304
I am very grateful for the invitation...

634
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:04,639
...I'll surely be there.

635
00:37:04,681 --> 00:37:06,641
When and where will the session be?

636
00:37:06,683 --> 00:37:08,601
Tomorrow, 9 o'clock sharp.

637
00:37:09,019 --> 00:37:10,980
Farewell, Don Carlos.

638
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,650
You have an unconditional friend in me.

639
00:37:15,985 --> 00:37:18,154
I promise that we'll be 
the light and hope...

640
00:37:18,195 --> 00:37:20,781
...to these people, so help me God.

641
00:37:22,615 --> 00:37:24,869
I'll see you tomorrow Congressman,
and good luck.

642
00:37:25,285 --> 00:37:26,829
-Thank you.
-Go ahead.

643
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,543
-See you tomorrow.
-Have a good night.

644
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:44,512
Fucking Congressman!

645
00:37:48,725 --> 00:37:51,603
-What's up, Ricardo?
-What with that face, Carlos?

646
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,520
We are in trouble.

647
00:37:53,563 --> 00:37:54,774
What happened?

648
00:37:55,149 --> 00:37:57,777
Some crazy dude just stopped by
arguing that thanks to...

649
00:37:57,818 --> 00:37:59,569
...the videos Javier showed...

650
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,279
...he is asking for 
Governor Vargas resignation.

651
00:38:01,571 --> 00:38:03,783
He's probably just someone
that was inspired by...

652
00:38:03,824 --> 00:38:05,785
-...what he saw on the news.
-Worse...

653
00:38:06,367 --> 00:38:08,411
He's the leader of the opposition
in the local Congress...

654
00:38:08,453 --> 00:38:10,206
...and apparently he has
a whole show set up.

655
00:38:11,832 --> 00:38:13,000
You know what?

656
00:38:13,918 --> 00:38:15,920
We have to alert the Governor.

657
00:38:21,258 --> 00:38:24,804
Guys, welcome to our beautiful State...

658
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:26,847
...I'm glad you agreed to come...

659
00:38:26,889 --> 00:38:29,934
...the party is really good
and the Governor...

660
00:38:29,975 --> 00:38:32,228
...was already bad mouthing you.

661
00:38:32,937 --> 00:38:35,438
We'll see how he takes the news
we are about to break to him.

662
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,689
Did something happen?

663
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,525
A Congressman came to my
room by surprise...

664
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:40,318
...one Agustín Morales which I'm sure...

665
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,403
...you know about.
And out of the blue...

666
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:43,906
...he told me tomorrow morning...

667
00:38:43,948 --> 00:38:46,491
...he is going to ask for the
Governor's resignation in Congress.

668
00:38:46,533 --> 00:38:48,493
To be honest he was quite determined.

669
00:38:48,535 --> 00:38:51,080
I know him perfectly from a long time ago.

670
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:54,791
Among other things, he was
the Governor's rival...

671
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:57,002
...in the past election, 
and since he lost...

672
00:38:57,044 --> 00:39:00,214
...the motherfucker keeps insisting...

673
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:01,464
...to bring us down.

674
00:39:01,714 --> 00:39:03,175
How dangerous is this guy?

675
00:39:05,261 --> 00:39:06,553
Somewhat dangerous.

676
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:10,224
He is one of those 
self-righteous assholes...

677
00:39:10,266 --> 00:39:13,310
...obsessed with justice, equality...

678
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,352
...democracy.

679
00:39:14,394 --> 00:39:17,106
In fact, the Governor's nickname
for him is "The Messiah".

680
00:39:18,356 --> 00:39:21,401
The Messiah, that suits him well.

681
00:39:21,776 --> 00:39:26,949
I'm going to have to ask you,
to be careful how you tell him...

682
00:39:26,991 --> 00:39:30,785
...the Governor has wanted
to shoot the guy for a long time...

683
00:39:30,827 --> 00:39:33,830
...so let's not give him an excuse to do so.

684
00:39:33,873 --> 00:39:34,915
No.

685
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:38,043
No, no, what we least need right now...

686
00:39:38,085 --> 00:39:39,460
...is another scandal.

687
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,838
Not at all.

688
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:03,944
What's up guys?
Still frightened?

689
00:40:05,154 --> 00:40:06,487
Guess what?

690
00:40:06,947 --> 00:40:09,158
I have to search you again.

691
00:40:13,954 --> 00:40:14,955
OK.

692
00:40:17,207 --> 00:40:20,793
Sorry guys, but we only let in...

693
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,670
...our high society here.

694
00:40:32,973 --> 00:40:36,101
So much food and I'm so hungry,
don't bring me here!

695
00:40:36,143 --> 00:40:38,062
I want to see you that way.

696
00:40:42,983 --> 00:40:44,234
Governor!

697
00:40:44,859 --> 00:40:47,279
Welcome boys!

698
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:51,033
Compadre, I want to introduce
you to some young men...

699
00:40:51,075 --> 00:40:53,327
...who are going to make me President.

700
00:40:53,785 --> 00:40:55,162
Nice to meet you, guys.

701
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:58,248
Take care of my boss.

702
00:40:58,623 --> 00:41:00,667
And don't go snitching about.

703
00:41:01,001 --> 00:41:03,878
-I'll let you guys talk.
-Thank you, compadre.

704
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:09,051
I'm glad you came.
This was your party.

705
00:41:09,093 --> 00:41:11,886
The dumbasses in my staff
mentioned that...

706
00:41:11,928 --> 00:41:13,805
-...you weren't coming.
-Thank you, Governor...

707
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:16,266
...but we are actually here
because an urgent matter.

708
00:41:16,308 --> 00:41:19,395
Go ahead man, I hold
no secrets from my friends.

709
00:41:19,436 --> 00:41:22,106
But first, have a drink.
Lucrecio!

710
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,525
Offer my guests something.

711
00:41:25,566 --> 00:41:28,028
Actually, it's work related
and it's very sensitive...

712
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:29,989
...it's better that we talk in private.

713
00:41:30,239 --> 00:41:32,490
What a hard-working kid...

714
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:34,410
...I like that, come over here.

715
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:40,790
OK, girls treat him well...

716
00:41:41,041 --> 00:41:43,377
...he needs to say
good things about our State.

717
00:41:48,173 --> 00:41:51,968
-So, what is this about?
-It's about Congressman Morales...

718
00:41:52,011 --> 00:41:54,221
...I spoke to him and he
mentioned tomorrow he is asking...

719
00:41:54,263 --> 00:41:58,058
-...for your resignation in Congress.
-My resignation? My resignation!

720
00:41:59,268 --> 00:42:02,729
Fucking Morales, he is a son of a bitch.

721
00:42:03,563 --> 00:42:06,358
That Messiah thinks he is unstoppable.

722
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:09,361
We'll have to teach him a lesson...

723
00:42:09,403 --> 00:42:11,738
...so he stops fucking around with us.

724
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:14,366
Honestly Governor, I don't
think that's a good idea.

725
00:42:14,408 --> 00:42:16,452
I think it's best for now...

726
00:42:16,493 --> 00:42:18,786
...to let tomorrow's session go unnoticed...

727
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:20,830
...that way we'll avoid another scandal.

728
00:42:21,206 --> 00:42:23,333
I'll speak to my Congressmen...

729
00:42:23,583 --> 00:42:26,961
...just like in the Federal Congress,
my party is the majority here.

730
00:42:27,003 --> 00:42:30,174
And many of the opposition 
members are on our side.

731
00:42:30,466 --> 00:42:32,967
I'll brief them and they'll be prepared...

732
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:35,553
...to convince him not to take the stand.

733
00:42:35,595 --> 00:42:37,347
Whatever you want, but it's important...

734
00:42:37,389 --> 00:42:40,184
...to have a few peaceful days,
to let the video scandal die down.

735
00:42:40,558 --> 00:42:42,685
Tomorrow I would like to
present you my strategy...

736
00:42:42,727 --> 00:42:44,687
...but the important thing...

737
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,939
...is that your opponent
doesn't generate another scandal...

738
00:42:46,981 --> 00:42:49,109
...otherwise we will be
worse off that we already are.

739
00:42:49,151 --> 00:42:52,446
I understand motherfucker,
I'm not as stupid as you think I am.

740
00:42:53,029 --> 00:42:55,698
If there is something I know
about is the value of...

741
00:42:55,740 --> 00:42:59,536
...communication and harmony
in Mexican politics.

742
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,330
I'll leave it to you Governor.

743
00:43:01,746 --> 00:43:05,125
OK, now let's go have a drink and a girl...

744
00:43:05,375 --> 00:43:07,127
...courtesy of my government.

745
00:43:07,169 --> 00:43:09,421
Governor, I wouldn't want
to sound rude, but tomorrow...

746
00:43:09,463 --> 00:43:11,507
...we have to get up early to work.

747
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,509
Don't you worry about that.
I'll handle it.

748
00:43:14,675 --> 00:43:16,928
Or maybe you don't dig chicks?

749
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:20,349
They say there are tons of fags in TV.

750
00:43:20,390 --> 00:43:22,642
-No, no, no.
-Come on!

751
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,980
Come here!

752
00:43:28,524 --> 00:43:29,358
Come on!

753
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:32,944
Train ride!

754
00:43:37,324 --> 00:43:38,783
What's up there?

755
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:42,912
<i>Carmelo Vargas, you better fucking leave!</i>

756
00:43:42,954 --> 00:43:46,166
<i>Carmelo Vargas, you better fucking leave!</i>

757
00:43:46,416 --> 00:43:49,961
<i>Carmelo Vargas, you better fucking leave!</i>

758
00:43:50,002 --> 00:43:51,463
<i>Carmelo Vargas...!</i>

759
00:43:51,505 --> 00:43:53,549
Fellow Congressmen...

760
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:56,676
...I know I have been
criticized by the Governor...

761
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:58,554
...and by many of you...

762
00:43:58,886 --> 00:44:02,849
...who have accused me of damaging
our State's public image.

763
00:44:04,476 --> 00:44:07,479
But my words are not harmful...

764
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:11,150
...as the acts of impunity and corruption...

765
00:44:11,441 --> 00:44:14,528
...that villain Vargas has committed.

766
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:16,904
Many of you here...

767
00:44:17,489 --> 00:44:19,657
...many of you here...

768
00:44:21,285 --> 00:44:22,619
Order!
Order please!

769
00:44:22,869 --> 00:44:24,496
Continue Congressman.

770
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,747
Thank you, Madam Chair.

771
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:30,627
Many of you here
cast doubts on the evidence...

772
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,087
...that I have previously shown you...

773
00:44:33,129 --> 00:44:36,341
...that document the
scandalous and disproportionate...

774
00:44:36,383 --> 00:44:38,134
...enrichment of the Governor.

775
00:44:39,344 --> 00:44:41,012
But after...

776
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,514
...but after...

777
00:44:42,556 --> 00:44:44,224
...but after...

778
00:44:44,266 --> 00:44:46,809
-Order!
-But after watching the videos...

779
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:50,355
...that have been aired on National TV...

780
00:44:50,397 --> 00:44:52,441
...shaming our State...

781
00:44:52,482 --> 00:44:54,568
...I ask this sovereign body...

782
00:44:54,610 --> 00:44:57,613
...to demand the immediate
resignation of the Governor...

783
00:44:57,654 --> 00:45:00,031
...and his gang of delinquents...

784
00:45:00,072 --> 00:45:02,992
...that have so badly damaged our State.

785
00:45:03,285 --> 00:45:05,662
-Order, please!
-Down with Vargas!

786
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,247
Down with Vargas!

787
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:09,790
You should shoot him!

788
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,378
He's hurt!

789
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,087
The Congressman was shot!

790
00:45:23,305 --> 00:45:26,475
Mr. Governor, this is the worst
thing that could have happened.

791
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:30,270
Not only do we have to deal...

792
00:45:30,312 --> 00:45:32,648
...with the impact of the videos
that unfortunately...

793
00:45:32,689 --> 00:45:34,815
...keep coming up in the newspapers...

794
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,109
...but also to the reactions
of this murder attempt.

795
00:45:39,363 --> 00:45:41,240
You're right, Carlos.

796
00:45:41,281 --> 00:45:44,576
All my staff are a bunch of idiots.

797
00:45:45,410 --> 00:45:48,413
I have told them a thousand times,
that if they shoot someone...

798
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:51,291
...the worst thing you can do,
is let them live.

799
00:45:51,625 --> 00:45:53,252
Don't worry,
Governor...

800
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:55,962
...the Congressman
is out of danger and we got...

801
00:45:56,212 --> 00:45:58,382
...the culprits, who acknowledged
full responsibility.

802
00:45:58,423 --> 00:46:00,550
The problem is that 
there was tons of media...

803
00:46:00,592 --> 00:46:02,511
...and if for any reason, 
the news gets out...

804
00:46:02,552 --> 00:46:04,638
...the pressure for your
resignation Governor...

805
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:06,306
...will come straight
from the Official Residence.

806
00:46:06,348 --> 00:46:09,685
Don't worry about local media,
they are all on our payroll...

807
00:46:09,726 --> 00:46:11,603
...and they only publish
what we ask them to.

808
00:46:11,645 --> 00:46:14,063
Sirs, a shoot out in a Congress...

809
00:46:14,105 --> 00:46:16,400
...even if it's a local one, 
is national news.

810
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:18,985
Well my dear Carlitos...

811
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:21,195
...this problem is as 
much mine as is it yours.

812
00:46:22,029 --> 00:46:24,115
But you guys can fix anything.

813
00:46:24,616 --> 00:46:27,159
That is why I am paying
a fortune to your Network.

814
00:46:29,036 --> 00:46:30,037
Right?

815
00:46:33,833 --> 00:46:36,836
I don't see another solution than to
set in motion the "Chinese Box".

816
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:40,006
What the fuck do the Chinese
have to do with all of this?

817
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:44,303
Let me explain the "Chinese Box".

818
00:46:46,638 --> 00:46:49,140
We need to find another story.

819
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:52,226
Something big that distracts
attention so that the attempt...

820
00:46:52,268 --> 00:46:55,021
...is in the backstage. A story...

821
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,857
...that people can relate to,
that moves them.

822
00:46:58,107 --> 00:46:59,526
That is the "Chinese Box".

823
00:46:59,735 --> 00:47:02,111
Well here we have tons of stories...

824
00:47:02,153 --> 00:47:03,946
...about shoot outs and executions...

825
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:06,700
...just this morning 
we found 8 casualties...

826
00:47:06,742 --> 00:47:08,993
...in a rodeo, would
that work for you, Don Carlos?

827
00:47:09,035 --> 00:47:11,330
No, no. Captain, any ideas?

828
00:47:11,371 --> 00:47:15,082
No, what I've got are
also blood related events. Look.

829
00:47:20,714 --> 00:47:23,342
No, no.

830
00:47:23,383 --> 00:47:26,386
We have orders from on high
to bury these kinds of stories...

831
00:47:26,428 --> 00:47:28,638
...so people think that these 
things aren't happening...

832
00:47:28,680 --> 00:47:29,723
...besides...

833
00:47:29,765 --> 00:47:32,058
...viewers are already
fed up with the yellow press...

834
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:33,685
...and honestly...

835
00:47:33,727 --> 00:47:36,270
...I don't think it's a good
idea to focus on killings...

836
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:37,938
...and decapitations in your State,
Mr. Governor.

837
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,232
Carlos, I'm not sure we are following you...

838
00:47:40,274 --> 00:47:41,901
...what exactly are you thinking?

839
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,945
I'm thinking about, a sex scandal...

840
00:47:44,987 --> 00:47:47,198
...somebody important, a--

841
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,576
A natural disaster.

842
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,663
Do you remember the trapped miners?

843
00:47:54,914 --> 00:47:56,123
Something like that.

844
00:47:56,165 --> 00:47:57,834
A story that engages people...

845
00:47:57,875 --> 00:48:00,086
...so they stop thinking about 
the Governor's resignation.

846
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,214
The only thing is
we'll need it in a couple hours...

847
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,800
...so we can air it on the news.

848
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:09,136
OK, sons of bitches, you heard him!
Get to work and start thinking!

849
00:48:09,178 --> 00:48:12,056
The shit hit the fan,
we need to help Carlitos.

850
00:48:12,098 --> 00:48:13,891
-Hurry!
-Excuse me, Godfather.

851
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,268
-See you, compadre.
-Excuse me, sir.

852
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,937
-Yes, sir.
-Don't worry, Carlos...

853
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:20,774
...we'll come up with something.

854
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:28,657
<i>Who's afraid of the big bad wolf </i>
<i>The big bad wolf</i>

855
00:48:29,156 --> 00:48:34,788
<i>Kids are afraid of the big bad wolf </i>
<i>The big bad wolf</i>

856
00:48:34,830 --> 00:48:36,956
<i>Such big ears, the better to hear you with</i>

857
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:41,420
<i>Such big eyes, the better to see you with</i>

858
00:48:41,795 --> 00:48:43,797
I've already shown you my LA pictures?

859
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:45,381
-No. Let's see.
-Look.

860
00:48:45,424 --> 00:48:47,133
Here I was just arriving...

861
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:50,928
-...and then--
-Pancho, don't!

862
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:56,016
<i>Big teeth, the better to eat</i>

863
00:48:56,058 --> 00:48:57,686
<i>Such big teeth, the better</i>

864
00:48:57,727 --> 00:48:59,228
Look, here the people...

865
00:48:59,270 --> 00:49:02,858
-...are starting to eat, but--
-Stop, don't do that!

866
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:06,110
-The last one.
-Show me the picture.

867
00:49:06,152 --> 00:49:09,614
So imagine, here in this park...

868
00:49:09,656 --> 00:49:12,659
I said stop!

869
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:22,627
-Where are the girls, Pancho?
-I don't know.

870
00:49:22,669 --> 00:49:23,670
Ana!

871
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:25,379
Elena!

872
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,381
Ana!

873
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,175
Elena!

874
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:33,597
Ana!

875
00:49:34,806 --> 00:49:36,432
Elena!

876
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,521
Ana!

877
00:49:43,439 --> 00:49:45,316
Elena!

878
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:53,867
There is no doubt, the twins
will be a wonderful story.

879
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:55,494
What can you tell me about the family?

880
00:49:55,827 --> 00:49:57,871
Nothing special, Don Carlos.

881
00:49:57,913 --> 00:50:00,164
The dad is a small business man...

882
00:50:00,206 --> 00:50:01,625
...and the mother is a stay at home mom.

883
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:03,877
Apparently the girls
were inside the compound...

884
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:05,377
...and the maid was
flirting with the gardener.

885
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:07,756
Once they started looking,
they couldn't find them.

886
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,883
The mom is going crazy.

887
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,552
Attorney, please get me 
all the information...

888
00:50:12,594 --> 00:50:14,513
...and tell the parents we are on our way.

889
00:50:19,684 --> 00:50:23,020
Martin, go with them.
Toño, go with Ricardo.

890
00:50:24,523 --> 00:50:26,482
Look Lucia, can I call
you by your first name?

891
00:50:26,525 --> 00:50:27,316
Of course.

892
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,276
We want you to tell us
in the simplest possible way...

893
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:31,738
...but emotive,
everything that happened.

894
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:35,199
Don't get nervous, I'm here to help...

895
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,117
...if you need to, 
we'll do it several times.

896
00:50:37,702 --> 00:50:40,412
Thanks, but I'm not sure
I can, I'm a wreck...

897
00:50:40,664 --> 00:50:42,582
-....of nerves--
-Easy, it will be fine.

898
00:50:43,082 --> 00:50:45,501
OK, Mr. and Mrs. Garza,
this will be easy.

899
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:47,211
Ricardo will ask you a few questions...

900
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:49,005
...when he does, you look straight at him...

901
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,131
...and when you answer
you look straight into the camera.

902
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,927
Questions?
OK, we're rolling.

903
00:50:55,720 --> 00:50:58,640
Five, four, three...

904
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:01,560
...two.

905
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:05,689
We are here tonight in the home
of Lucia and Salvador Garza...

906
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,024
...who will share with us...

907
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,067
...the anguish they are living right now.

908
00:51:10,276 --> 00:51:13,947
Their two small twin daughters,
Ana and Elena...

909
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:16,950
...disappeared this morning
from their own house.

910
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,787
Lucia, tell us, what happened?

911
00:51:20,829 --> 00:51:24,248
Look Ricardo, this morning
while I was showering...

912
00:51:24,290 --> 00:51:26,668
...Juanita, the girls' nanny, 
came running...

913
00:51:26,710 --> 00:51:28,962
...to tell me she couldn't find them...

914
00:51:29,004 --> 00:51:31,338
...they were playing in the garden...

915
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,757
...and suddenly they weren't there.

916
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,092
They disappeared just like that?

917
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:39,598
At first we thought they could
be at a neighbors' house...

918
00:51:39,931 --> 00:51:43,142
...we looked everywhere
but we couldn't find them...

919
00:51:43,183 --> 00:51:45,854
...so... I was desperate...

920
00:51:45,895 --> 00:51:47,689
...and I called Salvador at work...

921
00:51:47,981 --> 00:51:50,149
...we kept looking, all three of us...

922
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,818
...all over the compound, without success.

923
00:51:52,568 --> 00:51:55,404
Then Salvador decided to call the police...

924
00:51:55,446 --> 00:51:58,742
...but we haven't heard any news.

925
00:51:59,575 --> 00:52:01,327
Could this be a kidnapping?

926
00:52:02,037 --> 00:52:02,871
No.

927
00:52:02,954 --> 00:52:04,163
No, no.

928
00:52:05,164 --> 00:52:07,124
We are not wealthy, no...

929
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,754
No...
We don't have enemies.

930
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:15,091
We are a middle-class family, no--

931
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:21,472
Salvador, do you have any
ties to organized crime?

932
00:52:21,513 --> 00:52:23,349
Any business that could cause this...

933
00:52:23,390 --> 00:52:25,434
...gambling debts, revenge...

934
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:28,063
...any disgruntled employee,
you don't suspect anybody?

935
00:52:28,980 --> 00:52:31,650
Look, Ricardo, we are good people.

936
00:52:32,025 --> 00:52:34,110
We would never hurt anyone.

937
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:37,072
I'm begging anybody
that could have seen something...

938
00:52:37,113 --> 00:52:38,740
...or that knows where my girls are...

939
00:52:39,615 --> 00:52:43,243
...to please, get in touch
with us or the police...

940
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,747
...any information can be very useful.

941
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:48,792
I beg you for the love of God...

942
00:52:48,833 --> 00:52:51,251
...help us find them we are in despair...

943
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:53,755
Cut! Cut!
Very good Lucia, very good.

944
00:52:53,797 --> 00:52:56,132
But this time can you
say that directly to the camera...

945
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:57,050
...holding the girls' picture.

946
00:52:57,299 --> 00:53:00,344
And also, don't wipe your tears. All right?

947
00:53:00,679 --> 00:53:02,513
Millions of viewers are watching you.

948
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:04,223
You don't know how this can help.

949
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:06,475
OK?
There is the picture.

950
00:53:06,517 --> 00:53:08,185
Take your time.

951
00:53:11,856 --> 00:53:13,692
Very well. Very well.

952
00:53:15,275 --> 00:53:18,445
-A little higher, a litt--
-Like this?

953
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,656
Like that, thank you.

954
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:24,869
We are good people, Ricardo...

955
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,246
...we would never hurt anybody.

956
00:53:28,247 --> 00:53:30,666
I'm begging anybody who saw something...

957
00:53:30,917 --> 00:53:33,086
...or has any information
on where my girls are.

958
00:53:33,669 --> 00:53:36,422
Please get in touch with us or the police...

959
00:53:36,463 --> 00:53:38,507
...any information is useful.

960
00:53:40,051 --> 00:53:42,971
I beg you, for the love of God.

961
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:46,808
Help us find them,
we are in despair, please!

962
00:53:46,850 --> 00:53:49,435
And so Javier, once more
we are witnessing...

963
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,188
...a terrible story,
one that calls for unity...

964
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:54,816
...and moves us to search
for the best within us.

965
00:53:55,108 --> 00:53:57,443
Finally, I would like to
report that Governor Vargas...

966
00:53:57,484 --> 00:53:59,570
...headed an operation to continue...

967
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,280
<i>...the search for these little girls...</i>

968
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:06,326
<i>...since the early hours of today </i>
<i>Governor Carmelo Vargas...</i>

969
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:09,873
<i>...personally led the search </i>
<i>team to find the twins...</i>

970
00:54:09,914 --> 00:54:11,124
<i>...Ana and Elena Garza.</i>

971
00:54:11,166 --> 00:54:13,542
-Come on, let's search for them.
-Yes, sir.

972
00:54:15,003 --> 00:54:15,962
All along the side.

973
00:54:16,004 --> 00:54:18,923
<i>In order to find any </i>
<i>clue to the girls' whereabouts...</i>

974
00:54:18,965 --> 00:54:21,176
<i>...the Governor put all his...</i>

975
00:54:21,217 --> 00:54:22,676
<i>...security corps...</i>

976
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:26,638
<i>...who continue working tirelessly.</i>

977
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,184
<i>Unfortunately until now...</i>

978
00:54:29,225 --> 00:54:32,311
<i>...there has been </i>
<i>no clue to their whereabouts.</i>

979
00:54:32,352 --> 00:54:35,564
Back to you in the studio
and we'll keep informed...

980
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,901
...for 24 hours in 30 minutes...

981
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:41,029
-...Ricardo Diaz.
-Thank you, Ricardo.

982
00:54:42,113 --> 00:54:45,407
There you have it, one family's
drama, just like any other...

983
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:47,284
...that in a matter of minutes...

984
00:54:47,409 --> 00:54:50,329
...their lives were shattered forever.

985
00:54:50,997 --> 00:54:52,957
You are probably wondering...

986
00:54:52,999 --> 00:54:54,918
...what could be the fate of these twins...

987
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:56,585
...in a world such as we live in today.

988
00:54:57,294 --> 00:55:00,714
Our colleague Laura Cardenas
has prepared the following report.

989
00:55:01,925 --> 00:55:04,010
<i>Javier, today a group of pimps...</i>

990
00:55:04,052 --> 00:55:05,469
<i>...was arrested...</i>

991
00:55:05,511 --> 00:55:08,973
...they kept young girls in captivity...

992
00:55:09,015 --> 00:55:11,683
...between 12 and 19 years old...

993
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:15,063
<i>The Attorney General informed </i>
<i>us that this group...</i>

994
00:55:15,104 --> 00:55:17,648
<i>...was connected to a pedophile network...</i>

995
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:21,443
<i>...that not only sexually  </i>
<i>exploited the minors...</i>

996
00:55:21,485 --> 00:55:23,988
<i>...but also produced  </i>
<i>pornographic material...</i>

997
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:24,989
<i>...for commercialization---</i>

998
00:55:25,031 --> 00:55:26,157
How are they Ma'am?

999
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,783
They are fine, boss.

1000
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:30,119
They were crying a lot at first...

1001
00:55:30,161 --> 00:55:33,580
...and didn't go to sleep,
but now they are fine.

1002
00:55:36,375 --> 00:55:38,502
-Cover them up.
-Yes, boss.

1003
00:55:38,544 --> 00:55:40,213
And keep an eye on them.

1004
00:55:40,504 --> 00:55:42,464
Don't go falling asleep on me.

1005
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,968
No, don't worry, Don.

1006
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:52,558
<i>In Mexico every year thousands </i>
<i>of kids are reported missing.</i>

1007
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,936
<i>Worldwide studies and statistics...</i>

1008
00:55:54,978 --> 00:55:57,063
<i>...show that infant trafficking...</i>

1009
00:55:57,105 --> 00:55:59,731
.<i>..along with drug and arms trafficking...</i>

1010

<i>...is one of the most  </i>
<i>profitable businesses...</i>

1011
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:04,611
<i>...for international mafia circles.</i>

1012
00:56:04,653 --> 00:56:07,240
<i>Women trafficking, child slavery...</i>

1013
00:56:07,282 --> 00:56:08,908
<i>...for sexual exploitation--</i>

1014
00:56:08,950 --> 00:56:10,118
Hey boss...

1015
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,120
And if we do as they say on TV...

1016
00:56:12,161 --> 00:56:13,662
...and sell the girls to a brothel?

1017
00:56:13,913 --> 00:56:15,747
Wouldn't we make more dough?

1018
00:56:16,916 --> 00:56:18,293
They are very pretty.

1019
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:23,256
Imagine what we would
get with those eyes...

1020
00:56:23,298 --> 00:56:24,590
...and their little hearts--

1021
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:27,343
Stop talking bullshit, you idiots.

1022
00:56:28,052 --> 00:56:29,929
We agreed from a start that things...

1023
00:56:29,971 --> 00:56:31,014
...would go my way.

1024
00:56:31,597 --> 00:56:35,143
If you don't like it you 
can go fuck yourself.

1025
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:36,602
OK?

1026
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:41,732
<i>...10 thousand to 150 thousand dollars </i>
<i>depending on the final destination--</i>

1027
00:56:42,025 --> 00:56:46,403
<i>For 24 hours in 30 minutes, </i>
<i>this is Laura Cardenas...</i>

1028
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,114
<i>...back to you, Javier.</i>

1029
00:56:54,329 --> 00:56:55,787
What's up Pepe, how did we do?

1030
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,498
Excellent.

1031
00:56:59,458 --> 00:57:00,960
No, no, I loved the report...

1032
00:57:01,002 --> 00:57:02,921
...I thought it was great
to talk about child prostitutes.

1033
00:57:04,130 --> 00:57:06,215
Yes, I checked the numbers
on Facebook and Twitter...

1034
00:57:06,257 --> 00:57:08,301
...this is a steamroller.
How did we do in the ratings?

1035
00:57:12,138 --> 00:57:13,348
And in share?

1036
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:16,808
God damn, almost like the soap opera.

1037
00:57:18,186 --> 00:57:21,147
Don't worry, I got it under control.

1038
00:57:22,398 --> 00:57:23,607
OK.

1039
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:25,318
Congratulations to you too.

1040
00:57:25,985 --> 00:57:27,195
Bye.

1041
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,746
As you can see the strategy
was a big success.

1042
00:57:38,206 --> 00:57:40,624
No one in the media even mentions
the Governors' swindles...

1043
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,418
...nor the attempt on 
Congressman Morales.

1044
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:45,587
You really are a genius, Carlos.
My godfather was really pleased.

1045
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,007
He's probably still celebrating
right now, the bastard.

1046
00:57:50,009 --> 00:57:51,593
What do we know
about Congressman Morales?

1047
00:57:51,635 --> 00:57:54,263
He's out of danger, they'll
release him in a couple days.

1048
00:57:54,805 --> 00:57:56,640
The twins' investigation,
Attorney General?

1049
00:57:56,975 --> 00:57:58,809
No news on that front,
Don Carlos...

1050
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:00,979
...we've been doing some questioning...

1051
00:58:01,020 --> 00:58:03,272
...and the most relevant
thing is apparently the Garzas...

1052
00:58:03,647 --> 00:58:05,482
..have some money issues.

1053
00:58:05,941 --> 00:58:07,776
The maid told us, that the marriage...

1054
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:09,445
...is not going well and that the missus...

1055
00:58:10,029 --> 00:58:12,948
...has a boyfriend, although
we haven't confirmed that.

1056
00:58:13,366 --> 00:58:16,035
Listen, I don't want to tell
you how to do your job...

1057
00:58:16,077 --> 00:58:18,079
...but don't you think 
that it is very likely...

1058
00:58:18,121 --> 00:58:20,415
...that one of them is behind
the girls' disappearance?

1059
00:58:21,581 --> 00:58:24,584
We shouldn't overlook that hypothesis.

1060
00:58:25,003 --> 00:58:27,005
So what you're saying is that...

1061
00:58:27,422 --> 00:58:30,216
...if you focus your
investigation on the Garzas...

1062
00:58:30,549 --> 00:58:34,053
...I'm sure you'll find some dirt.

1063

SPECIAL REPORT

1065
00:58:43,438 --> 00:58:46,190
Javier we are in front of
the Garza family home...

1066
00:58:46,232 --> 00:58:49,152
...where today investigations on...

1067
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:52,738
...the twins' disappearance
took an amazing twist.

1068
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,782
<i>We have prepared the following story.</i>

1069
00:58:55,824 --> 00:58:57,743
<i>Take your hands off me!</i>

1070
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,872
<i>Since early this morning the </i>
<i>Attorney General informed us...</i>

1071
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:05,418
<i>...that several inconsistencies </i>
<i>and contradictions...</i>

1072
00:59:05,460 --> 00:59:07,586
<i>...were found in the  parents' declarations.</i>

1073
00:59:07,627 --> 00:59:10,089
<i>The Garzas' were at </i>
<i>the Public prosecutor's...</i>

1074
00:59:10,131 --> 00:59:11,466
<i>...office giving testimony...</i>

1075
00:59:11,507 --> 00:59:12,799
<i>...until late last night.</i>

1076
00:59:13,134 --> 00:59:15,927
<i>Unfortunately when  </i>
<i>crosschecking their stories...</i>

1077
00:59:15,969 --> 00:59:18,597
<i>...we found contradicting </i>
<i>elements in the facts.</i>

1078
00:59:18,930 --> 00:59:21,683
Pursuant to the Public
prosecutor's criteria...

1079
00:59:21,725 --> 00:59:25,188
...this means there was a 
premeditated attempt to hide information...

1080
00:59:25,229 --> 00:59:27,647
...and serious mutual accusations.

1081
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:31,235
<i>What looked to be a solid marriage...</i>

1082
00:59:31,277 --> 00:59:33,446
<i>...when confronted by our cameras...</i>

1083
00:59:33,488 --> 00:59:35,114
<i>...it became evident...</i>

1084
00:59:35,156 --> 00:59:37,116
<i>...that it was all appearances.</i>

1085
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:40,328
<i>In a relation in which lies, treason...</i>

1086
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:43,081
<i>...and indifference, are present everyday.</i>

1087
00:59:43,122 --> 00:59:46,209
Lucia, tell us, how is your
relationship with your husband...

1088
00:59:46,250 --> 00:59:47,751
...we know you've had your problems.

1089
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:51,671
Ricardo, let me tell you
we have had our problems...

1090
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:53,382
...but no more than any other couple.

1091
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,219
Sometimes we fight, like all marriages, OK?

1092
00:59:56,843 --> 00:59:59,638
But there are rumors that Salvador
left the house more than a month ago.

1093
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,599
What happened in your relationship
that led you to make such a strong...

1094
01:00:02,641 --> 01:00:04,810
...choice that led to the
disappearance of your girls?

1095
01:00:08,688 --> 01:00:11,442
<i>And when it looked like </i>
<i>we were only witnessing...</i>

1096
01:00:11,484 --> 01:00:12,651
<i>...a marital crisis...</i>

1097
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:16,280
<i>...Juana Casimiro, the girl's nanny...</i>

1098
01:00:16,322 --> 01:00:19,908
<i>...revelations, gave the story </i>
<i>a 180 degree turn.</i>

1099
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,370
Juanita, how many years
have you worked with the family?

1100
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,037
Five years.

1101
01:00:24,580 --> 01:00:27,375
When the girls were born,
the missus hired me to help her.

1102
01:00:27,707 --> 01:00:30,169
Tell us, in confidence
is it true that they have...

1103
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:31,337
...many problems?

1104
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:35,258
Specially when Mr. Garza
found out she had a boyfriend.

1105
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:36,842
He left the house.

1106
01:00:37,050 --> 01:00:39,052
Let's see, tell us how did he found out?

1107
01:00:39,428 --> 01:00:42,055
Don't tell me the boyfriend
stayed overnight?

1108
01:00:44,225 --> 01:00:45,226
Yes.

1109
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:48,645
<i>Salvador Garza, father of the girls...</i>

1110
01:00:48,687 --> 01:00:51,524
<i>...admitted that his business </i>
<i>is on the verge of bankruptcy.</i>

1111
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:54,734
Salvador, there is talk
that you have serious money issues...

1112
01:00:54,776 --> 01:00:57,863
...and because of that your
marriage is in crisis...

1113
01:00:57,904 --> 01:00:59,739
...don't you think this 
has anything to do...

1114
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:01,617
...with your girls' disappearance?

1115
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,952
With all due respect Ricardo,
I don't understand...

1116
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,745
...what one thing has to do with the other.

1117
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:09,375
It's true, my business is going
through a rough patch at the moment...

1118
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:12,085
...and yes, I've had
some issues in my marriage...

1119
01:01:12,127 --> 01:01:14,045
...with Lucia.
But what makes you think...

1120
01:01:14,087 --> 01:01:16,089
...that it has anything to do
with the girls' disappearance?

1121
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,217
Sorry Salvador, but to me it's evident.

1122
01:01:18,675 --> 01:01:21,470
<i>Mr. Gomez, Lucia Garza's lover...</i>

1123
01:01:21,512 --> 01:01:22,888
<i>...well known in the State...</i>

1124
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:25,056
<i>...to be a heartbreaker...</i>

1125
01:01:25,433 --> 01:01:27,809
<i>...refused to be interviewed, and was...</i>

1126
01:01:27,851 --> 01:01:30,729
<i>...what we can say arrogant and violent...</i>

1127
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:34,900
<i>...letting us infer that  </i>
<i>he has something to hide.</i>

1128
01:01:34,941 --> 01:01:36,902
-Mr. Gomez--
-Please, turn your camera off.

1129
01:01:37,236 --> 01:01:40,281
Mr. Gomez, we know you have an affair...

1130
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:42,283
...with the girls' mother
and that you stayed overnight...

1131
01:01:42,325 --> 01:01:43,783
...the night before they went missing.

1132
01:01:43,825 --> 01:01:46,786
-Do you have anything to say?
- Sons of @%&$(?!

1133
01:01:47,162 --> 01:01:49,207
It's your fault the country
is in the state it's in.

1134
01:01:49,248 --> 01:01:50,916
I'm going to ask you to
please respect my privacy.

1135
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:52,210
Excuse me.

1136
01:01:52,460 --> 01:01:53,628
-Why don't you want to--
-Shut up!

1137
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,879
<i>So in conclusion, after a day...</i>

1138
01:01:55,921 --> 01:01:57,923
<i>...full of revelations and surprises...</i>

1139
01:01:57,964 --> 01:02:00,717
<i>...the Public prosecutor decided to issue...</i>

1140
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,637
<i>...a detention order...</i>

1141
01:02:02,678 --> 01:02:06,265
<i>...that was executed by the State Attorney.</i>

1142
01:02:06,307 --> 01:02:07,391
Take your hands off me.

1143
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:12,647
<i>This afternoon after </i>
<i>declaring to the Attorney General...</i>

1144
01:02:12,688 --> 01:02:15,857
<i>...the Garzas' nanny Juana Casimiro...</i>

1145
01:02:15,899 --> 01:02:18,527
<i>...and Manuel Gomez, presumed </i>
<i>lover of Lucia Garza...</i>

1146
01:02:18,569 --> 01:02:21,947
<i>...were detained under police </i>
<i>custody in a motel...</i>

1147
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:25,660
<i>...in the capital, under charges </i>
<i>of being prime suspects...</i>

1148
01:02:25,701 --> 01:02:27,994
<i>...in the girls' disappearance.</i>

1149
01:02:28,371 --> 01:02:30,498
We'll keep you posted...

1150
01:02:30,539 --> 01:02:32,667
...on any developments.

1151
01:02:32,708 --> 01:02:34,918
And we'll keep in touch.

1152
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,630
For 24 hours in 30 minutes...

1153
01:02:38,631 --> 01:02:41,049
-...Ricardo Diaz.
-Thank you, Ricardo.

1154
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,302
There is no doubt that every day...

1155
01:02:43,344 --> 01:02:45,554
...in this country it is harder...

1156
01:02:45,596 --> 01:02:47,097
...to trust people upon appearance only.

1157
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:50,141
And to you, watching us from your home...

1158
01:02:50,183 --> 01:02:52,894
...we invite you to participate
in today's question:

1159
01:02:52,936 --> 01:02:55,188
Who do you think has more blame in...

1160
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,941
...the twins' disappearance?
Our options are:

1161
01:02:57,983 --> 01:03:00,235
A) The mother.
B) The father.

1162
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,821
C) The boyfriend.
D) The nanny.

1163
01:03:03,113 --> 01:03:06,199
<i>Please participate by calling our numbers.</i>

1164
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:08,619
<i>But let me tell you that so far...</i>

1165
01:03:08,661 --> 01:03:11,622
<i>...our operators report </i>
<i>the following result.</i>

1166
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:15,041
<i>The mom the most votes as </i>
<i>responsible party, with 46%</i>

1167
01:03:15,334 --> 01:03:18,253
<i>The dad a close second, with 43%</i>

1168
01:03:18,754 --> 01:03:20,964
<i>The boyfriend far away, with 8%</i>

1169
01:03:21,006 --> 01:03:23,883
<i>And the nanny, with a symbolic 3%</i>

1170
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:24,968
Keep calling...

1171
01:03:25,010 --> 01:03:27,137
...you still have a chance
to give us your opinion.

1172
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:29,889
28 rating points and 49 share. I agree...

1173
01:03:29,931 --> 01:03:31,767
...this is totally phenomenal.

1174
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,145
Pepe, I wanted to thank you
for the opportunity...

1175
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:36,731
...you don't know how much I appreciate it.

1176
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,443
Of course.
I'll tell Ricardo.

1177
01:03:40,651 --> 01:03:42,611
Bye.

1178
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:53,539
Yes.

1179
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:56,792
<i>Don Carlos, good evening. </i>
<i>I didn't interrupt you, did I?</i>

1180
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:59,628
No, no. Don't worry Mr. Attorney General
tell me, any news?

1181
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,963
<i>Just to let you know </i>
<i>I had to release...</i>

1182
01:04:02,005 --> 01:04:03,424
<i>...the girls' parents.</i>

1183
01:04:03,882 --> 01:04:05,967
For fuck's sake, man,
why didn't you tell me?

1184
01:04:06,385 --> 01:04:08,970
<i>I'm very sorry Don Carlos, </i>
<i>but I had no choice.</i>

1185
01:04:09,012 --> 01:04:11,139
<i>A witness came up </i>
<i>and said he saw some people...</i>

1186
01:04:11,181 --> 01:04:13,601
<i>...taking the girls and their </i>
<i>lawyer got them an released.</i>

1187
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:16,019
What do you mean a witness?
Attorney, listen to me...

1188
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,937
...come up with a way to stop him
I'm on my way...

1189
01:04:17,979 --> 01:04:19,981
...and have him talk to no one
until I'm there, do you understand?

1190
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,149
<i>Yes, Don Carlos.</i>

1191
01:04:21,692 --> 01:04:22,901
Fuck--!

1192
01:04:29,450 --> 01:04:32,578
OK, motherfucker, repeat
everything you said.

1193
01:04:33,912 --> 01:04:35,748
Well boss...

1194
01:04:36,915 --> 01:04:39,959
...the day that the girls were taken...

1195
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,797
...I was working in a house...

1196
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:45,758
...it was around 11:30...

1197
01:04:46,759 --> 01:04:47,884
...when suddenly...

1198
01:04:48,719 --> 01:04:51,930
...I saw a pair of thugs take the twins...

1199
01:04:51,971 --> 01:04:56,142
...wrapped in blankets
and threw them inside a truck...

1200
01:04:56,769 --> 01:04:58,937
...driven by another dude.

1201
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,649
And they took off.

1202
01:05:01,690 --> 01:05:03,191
Why didn't you say anything before?

1203
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,362
Because... I saw that
they were looking for them on TV...

1204
01:05:07,405 --> 01:05:10,156
...and I thought there might be a reward.

1205
01:05:10,825 --> 01:05:13,452
Here is your reward, you son of a bitch!

1206
01:05:13,494 --> 01:05:15,538
Stop, stop!

1207
01:05:18,206 --> 01:05:19,792
Can you ID these guys?

1208
01:05:21,376 --> 01:05:22,711
Of course, boss.

1209
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:26,172
I already... described them
to the Commander.

1210
01:05:26,882 --> 01:05:27,883
Right boss?

1211
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,515
Let's go talk somewhere else.

1212
01:05:41,354 --> 01:05:42,313
What do you think?

1213
01:05:42,773 --> 01:05:44,608
It all holds together.

1214
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:46,694
We asked around and that bastard...

1215
01:05:46,735 --> 01:05:48,612
...is telling the truth. In fact...

1216
01:05:48,654 --> 01:05:50,573
...he already ID'ed two of the thugs...

1217
01:05:50,614 --> 01:05:52,533
...a pair of lowly miscreants, look.

1218
01:06:05,588 --> 01:06:06,547
And what are you doing with him?

1219
01:06:06,839 --> 01:06:08,381
We have to let him go.

1220
01:06:08,632 --> 01:06:09,884
We have nothing on him.

1221
01:06:10,216 --> 01:06:12,010
Unless, you say otherwise.

1222
01:06:12,051 --> 01:06:14,387
No, after the beating you gave him...

1223
01:06:14,429 --> 01:06:16,682
...he is probably sorry he opened his mouth.

1224
01:06:17,182 --> 01:06:18,893
Just let me have his contact details...

1225
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:20,519
...in case I have to interview him.

1226
01:06:20,811 --> 01:06:23,856
His name is Castulo Servin, and
he lives in a shanty town.

1227
01:06:24,147 --> 01:06:25,566
Here are his contact details.

1228
01:07:07,983 --> 01:07:10,528
-Congressman Morales?
-Good evening, Don Carlos.

1229
01:07:10,736 --> 01:07:12,947
-What are you doing here?
-First of all...

1230
01:07:12,988 --> 01:07:15,114
...I apologize, for breaking in like this.

1231
01:07:15,156 --> 01:07:17,660
As you have already seen
my life is in danger...

1232
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:19,620
-...and I must tread carefully.
-I don't know if...

1233
01:07:19,662 --> 01:07:21,914
...you are overreacting
and I don't know if I can help you.

1234
01:07:22,205 --> 01:07:23,666
Much more than you think.

1235
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,001
My life is not important, if at the end...

1236
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,796
...my mission is successful and I can
bring down Vargas and his crew.

1237
01:07:29,254 --> 01:07:31,339
Remember Saint Augustine's words:

1238
01:07:31,715 --> 01:07:34,802
"The blood of martyrs, 
is the seed of liberty".

1239
01:07:34,843 --> 01:07:36,845
Well I find that corny and romantic...

1240
01:07:36,887 --> 01:07:38,096
...but tell me what you have in mind.

1241
01:07:38,639 --> 01:07:40,766
You know that we are also interested...

1242
01:07:40,808 --> 01:07:43,351
-...in taking down the Governor.
-Can you watch this please?

1243
01:07:44,979 --> 01:07:46,647
What is this Congressman?

1244
01:07:46,689 --> 01:07:48,691
More proof of the Governor's wrongdoing...

1245
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:50,525
...at this point,
I don't think there is anyone left...

1246
01:07:50,568 --> 01:07:51,569
...who is surprised by it.

1247
01:07:51,819 --> 01:07:54,697
Just watch carefully.

1248
01:07:55,113 --> 01:07:57,156
<i>I told you compadre, </i>
<i>I'm not like...</i>

1249
01:07:57,198 --> 01:07:58,659
<i>...the idiots from the opposing party.</i>

1250
01:07:58,701 --> 01:08:01,202
<i>I don't ask for charity, </i>
<i>that should be enough...</i>

1251
01:08:01,244 --> 01:08:03,998
<i>-...for a permit. </i>
<i>-You are greedy Governor.</i>

1252
01:08:04,330 --> 01:08:06,457
<i>OK. Deal.</i>

1253
01:08:06,499 --> 01:08:09,670
<i>As soon as you sign the permits </i>
<i>I'll deposit to your account.</i>

1254
01:08:09,712 --> 01:08:11,672
<i>And so you know there are </i>
<i>no hard feelings, I'll send...</i>

1255
01:08:11,714 --> 01:08:15,258
<i>...the receipts with a couple </i>
<i>of very easy chicks.</i>

1256
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,886
<i>Right on, but this time </i>
<i>they should speak Spanish!</i>

1257
01:08:18,136 --> 01:08:20,096
<i>The fucking Ruskies you sent last time...</i>

1258
01:08:20,138 --> 01:08:22,390
<i>...didn't understand me </i>
<i>when I asked them for a BJ...</i>

1259
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,184
<i>...the only way they understood, </i>
<i>was by showing them how to do it.</i>

1260
01:08:25,476 --> 01:08:28,563
<i>OK, but we have to be more discreet.</i>

1261
01:08:28,981 --> 01:08:31,066
<i>We don't want to repeat what </i>
<i>happened with Congressman Ramirez...</i>

1262
01:08:31,107 --> 01:08:33,027
<i>...when he found out he also wanted in...</i>

1263
01:08:33,068 --> 01:08:34,235
<i>...that big motherfucker.</i>

1264
01:08:34,277 --> 01:08:36,780
<i>Don't worry, compadre, we'll deal with it.</i>

1265
01:08:37,072 --> 01:08:39,033
<i>If any other stupid Congressman...</i>

1266
01:08:39,074 --> 01:08:41,159
<i>...wants to cross us we'll  </i>
<i>put a bullet in him...</i>

1267
01:08:41,200 --> 01:08:42,995
<i>...just like that fucker Ramirez, </i>
<i>and we'll move on.</i>

1268
01:08:43,244 --> 01:08:46,372
<i>That's my Governor, </i>
<i>always such a problem solver.</i>

1269
01:08:46,707 --> 01:08:50,044
<i>I really admire you, you're my hero!</i>

1270
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,921
What do you think, Don Carlos?

1271
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:56,759
This is Congressman Ramirez.

1272
01:08:58,468 --> 01:09:00,638
Another martyr for democracy.

1273
01:09:02,931 --> 01:09:04,099
Picture this...

1274
01:09:04,599 --> 01:09:07,352
...mastermind of a homicide...

1275
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,647
...women trafficking, money laundering...

1276
01:09:09,688 --> 01:09:11,230
...and embezzlement.

1277
01:09:11,272 --> 01:09:13,942
These are just some of the
beauties found in this video...

1278
01:09:13,984 --> 01:09:15,944
...that we can sink Vargas with.

1279
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,696
And what do you want us to do with this?

1280
01:09:17,738 --> 01:09:19,907
The same as last time,
air them on the news...

1281
01:09:19,948 --> 01:09:20,866
...with Perez-Harris.

1282
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:23,284
I'm sure that after this Vargas...

1283
01:09:23,326 --> 01:09:25,536
...will have no option but to resign.

1284
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:27,748
But we have to verify
the authenticity of the video...

1285
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:29,750
...in other occasions
they've been fakes.

1286
01:09:29,792 --> 01:09:31,794
Don't worry about that,
Don Carlos...

1287
01:09:32,086 --> 01:09:34,629
...I have a witness
who saw when Vargas gave...

1288
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:36,090
...the order to kill my colleague.

1289
01:09:39,384 --> 01:09:41,260
I'll check into it with my bosses...

1290
01:09:41,302 --> 01:09:43,221
...but I don't think there 
will be any problem.

1291
01:09:44,056 --> 01:09:45,264
Allow me.

1292
01:09:45,766 --> 01:09:47,517
Let me give you something.

1293
01:09:50,395 --> 01:09:51,689
It's a copy.

1294
01:09:52,605 --> 01:09:54,232
Please take care of it.

1295
01:09:54,692 --> 01:09:57,276
Please be very careful...

1296
01:09:57,318 --> 01:09:59,404
...you already saw what the tyrant can do.

1297
01:09:59,947 --> 01:10:02,198
And fear not...

1298
01:10:02,240 --> 01:10:04,076
...the success of our mission...

1299
01:10:04,118 --> 01:10:06,036
...is much more important than our destiny.

1300
01:10:06,870 --> 01:10:08,246
-Excuse me.
-It's okay.

1301
01:10:18,132 --> 01:10:21,135
-Good evening, Congressman.
-Good evening, Don Carlos.

1302
01:10:27,891 --> 01:10:30,643
Fuck me!

1303
01:10:31,436 --> 01:10:33,646
Another hazard to Mexico.

1304
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,027
Oscar, I'm going to need 
an urgent meeting...

1305
01:10:39,069 --> 01:10:40,779
...with the Governor
first thing tomorrow morning.

1306
01:10:41,571 --> 01:10:43,656
<i>We don't want to repeat what </i>
<i>happened with Congressman Ramirez...</i>

1307
01:10:43,698 --> 01:10:45,491
<i>...when he found out he also wanted in...</i>

1308
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:47,828
<i>-...that big motherfucker. </i>
<i>-Don't worry, compadre...</i>

1309
01:10:47,870 --> 01:10:51,581
<i>...we'll deal with it. </i>
<i>If any other stupid Congressman...</i>

1311
01:10:53,708 --> 01:10:55,169
<i>...just like that fucker Ramirez, </i>
<i>and we'll move on--</i>

1312
01:11:00,423 --> 01:11:02,467
What do you want me to say,
Don Carlos?

1313
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:03,509
That it wasn't me?

1314
01:11:03,969 --> 01:11:06,805
We'll I'll tell you,
"It wasn't me".

1315
01:11:07,181 --> 01:11:09,850
Mr. Governor these are 
grave accusations...

1316
01:11:09,892 --> 01:11:11,894
...if for any reason this gets out...

1317
01:11:11,935 --> 01:11:13,979
...we are going to have to start
from zero, and honestly...

1318
01:11:14,021 --> 01:11:15,939
-...I don't know if we can do that.
-Carlitos...

1319
01:11:16,190 --> 01:11:19,902
...let's not play dumb,
you and I both know that TV...

1320
01:11:19,943 --> 01:11:22,237
...can do anything.
Am I right?

1321
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,948
Yes Governor, but honestly
I never imagined...

1322
01:11:24,990 --> 01:11:27,201
-...that this would be so--
-So... what?

1323
01:11:27,242 --> 01:11:28,326
So fucked up?

1324
01:11:28,786 --> 01:11:31,287
Don't be naive Carlitos,
you weren't born yesterday.

1325
01:11:31,329 --> 01:11:33,289
That is how politics are played.

1326
01:11:33,331 --> 01:11:36,584
Or else, tell me the name of one
Governor or President...

1327
01:11:36,835 --> 01:11:39,462
...who has finished his duties
without a couple of dead bodies...

1328
01:11:39,504 --> 01:11:40,713
...in the closet.

1329
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:43,424
Some even before taking office.

1330
01:11:44,051 --> 01:11:45,219
Or...

1331
01:11:45,260 --> 01:11:47,637
Have you forgotten 
the stories of our current...

1332
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,807
...Mr. President.

1333
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:53,684
The problem here are the circumstances.

1334
01:11:53,726 --> 01:11:55,896
Congressman Morales
is not alone in this.

1335
01:11:55,938 --> 01:11:57,981
Those fucking Congressmen
are my bitches.

1336
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:03,028
What's up, compadre?

1337
01:12:06,572 --> 01:12:08,033
Don't fucking kid me, asshole.

1338
01:12:09,243 --> 01:12:11,870
Yes, yes, he's here with me now.
I'll let him know.

1339
01:12:11,912 --> 01:12:14,832
You focus on fixing that however you can.

1340
01:12:17,084 --> 01:12:18,668
Is something wrong, Governor?

1341
01:12:18,709 --> 01:12:20,879
Now we're in some real shit.

1342
01:12:21,839 --> 01:12:24,799
The Garza twins were kidnapped.

1343
01:12:25,217 --> 01:12:26,384
Kidnapped?

1344
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:31,014
Governor, I think we just won the lottery.

1345
01:12:31,430 --> 01:12:33,267
But I'm going to need all your support.

1346
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,157
Look Salvador, I understand
perfectly...

1347
01:12:49,199 --> 01:12:52,202
...what you're going through,
but you have to decide quickly.

1348
01:12:52,618 --> 01:12:54,745
They just asked you
for one million dollars...

1349
01:12:54,787 --> 01:12:56,206
...you have to start somewhere.

1350
01:12:56,248 --> 01:12:58,041
But we're not sure
this is the right way...

1351
01:12:58,083 --> 01:12:59,960
...I would like to check
this first with an attorney.

1352
01:13:00,668 --> 01:13:02,753
The only thing I want
is my daughters back.

1353
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:04,339
The message is very clear in the sense...

1354
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,840
...that there should be no
police intervention.

1355
01:13:06,091 --> 01:13:07,717
Give me the order, and
I'll tell them to go away.

1356
01:13:07,758 --> 01:13:10,304
Yes, but the 50 thousand dollars
that you are offering...

1357
01:13:10,345 --> 01:13:13,098
-...seems very little.
-OK, I'll speak to my bosses...

1358
01:13:13,140 --> 01:13:15,225
...and I'll get you 100 thousand,
but the exclusivity...

1359
01:13:15,267 --> 01:13:16,559
...contract has to be signed by both of you.

1360
01:13:17,643 --> 01:13:18,477
Yes.

1361
01:13:20,771 --> 01:13:22,316
Where will I get the rest?

1362
01:13:22,357 --> 01:13:24,400
You can mortgage your house
at the TV Network bank.

1363
01:13:24,985 --> 01:13:27,946
I'll put in a good word for you.

1364
01:13:33,035 --> 01:13:34,912
OK Salvador, sign it.

1365
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,961
Sign each page, and your full
signature in the last page.

1366
01:13:43,295 --> 01:13:45,130
-Lucia, you are also signing.
-Yes.

1367
01:13:46,672 --> 01:13:48,758
Let me remind you you can't even look...

1368
01:13:48,799 --> 01:13:50,509
...out the window without my permission.

1369
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:52,346
Do you agree?

1370
01:13:52,762 --> 01:13:55,390
The paperwork is in order, Attorney General.

1371
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:01,063
Are you sure you don't
need us, Don Carlos?

1372
01:14:01,104 --> 01:14:03,190
These kidnappers are real thugs...

1373
01:14:03,231 --> 01:14:05,317
-...and can be very tricky.
-Don't worry, I'll let you know...

1374
01:14:05,359 --> 01:14:07,027
...or Captain Gordoa if we need anything.

1375
01:14:07,361 --> 01:14:08,694
We'll be waiting.

1376
01:14:08,946 --> 01:14:11,114
Anything you need, let us know.
We're here to help.

1377
01:14:11,156 --> 01:14:12,782
Thank you, Attorney General.
Capitan.

1378
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,825
-We're here to help.
-I appreciate it.

1379
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,414
OK, all of you, listen up.

1380
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:22,209
This is private property
and I need you to get out.

1381
01:14:24,086 --> 01:14:27,255
Quiet, quiet!
Make way! Make way!

1382
01:14:28,340 --> 01:14:30,342
See that guard house?

1383
01:14:31,301 --> 01:14:33,011
Get behind it. Quick!

1384
01:14:33,053 --> 01:14:35,138
And don't be stupid, 
or I'll put you in jail.

1385
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,889
Come on!
Let's go!

1386
01:14:51,570 --> 01:14:54,408
Watch the light,
and don't let them block each other.

1387
01:14:55,993 --> 01:14:58,286
Lucia, Salvador, when we go live...

1388
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:00,788
...don't cover your faces
and watch the light, OK?

1389
01:15:01,289 --> 01:15:04,042
And something else, if you can
make it seem...

1390
01:15:04,084 --> 01:15:05,793
...as though you still have
some feelings for each other.

1391
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:11,549
Toño, when I talk about them...

1392
01:15:11,590 --> 01:15:13,592
...zoom in on their faces
and hold the close up.

1393
01:15:15,511 --> 01:15:16,679
Put the table in please.

1394
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,433
Governor, how are you getting along?

1395
01:15:19,474 --> 01:15:21,892
-We are about to go live.
-I'm doing well, damn it!

1396
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:24,520
It's very important that you show
self-confidence and composure...

1397
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:27,065
...but most importantly,
you can't show that you're reading.

1398
01:15:28,108 --> 01:15:29,817
Don't worry, slut head.

1399
01:15:29,859 --> 01:15:31,777
You'll see how I do it
better than the President.

1400
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:34,406
Also, please mind your language.

1401
01:15:35,823 --> 01:15:39,036
Governor, girls, both.
Let me know.

1402
01:15:39,077 --> 01:15:41,579
Joys and sorrows!

1403
01:15:41,620 --> 01:15:42,621
Over here!

1404
01:15:54,051 --> 01:15:56,219
Good evening.

1405
01:15:56,470 --> 01:15:58,096
This is 24 hours in 30 minutes...

1406
01:15:58,637 --> 01:16:01,266
...I'm Javier Perez-Harris,
and these are the headlines.

1407
01:16:02,225 --> 01:16:04,643
A new twist in the sad story...

1408
01:16:04,685 --> 01:16:06,771
...of the disappearance
of the Garza twins...

1409
01:16:06,812 --> 01:16:09,316
...this morning, due to lack of proof...

1410
01:16:09,357 --> 01:16:12,444
...the girls' parents
were released from custody.

1411
01:16:12,486 --> 01:16:14,945
But later on to everybody's surprise...

1412
01:16:14,987 --> 01:16:16,822
...the girls' situation was clarified...

1413
01:16:16,864 --> 01:16:19,950
...when the parents received a message...

1414
01:16:19,992 --> 01:16:22,079
...from a group of kidnappers...

1415
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:24,372
...requesting a ransom worth millions.

1416
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,166
We'll have all the details directly...

1417
01:16:26,208 --> 01:16:27,625
...with our special envoys.

1418
01:16:28,168 --> 01:16:30,253
<i>This is 24 hours in 30 minutes.</i>

1419
01:16:30,669 --> 01:16:31,879
Today is a historic day.

1420
01:16:32,255 --> 01:16:34,341
Let's see that thug Vargas' face...

1421
01:16:34,424 --> 01:16:37,135
...when they air those
videos on National TV.

1422
01:16:38,512 --> 01:16:40,138
...hear my prayers.

1423
01:16:40,514 --> 01:16:42,474
As we told you earlier...

1424
01:16:42,516 --> 01:16:45,435
...today was a particular
emotive and dramatic...

1425
01:16:45,477 --> 01:16:48,438
...day in the case of the
disappearance of the Garza twins.

1426
01:16:48,480 --> 01:16:51,149
To bring us up to speed,
we're going live...

1427
01:16:51,191 --> 01:16:52,942
...with our special envoy Ricardo Diaz.

1428
01:16:53,318 --> 01:16:54,319
You're on, Ricardo.

1429
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:57,780
<i>Javier, good evening, we are transmitting...</i>

1430
01:16:57,822 --> 01:17:00,825
...from Lucia and Salvador Garza's home.

1431
01:17:01,201 --> 01:17:02,952
As you already 
mentioned today was a day...

1432
01:17:02,993 --> 01:17:05,372
...full of real drama...

1433
01:17:05,413 --> 01:17:07,957
...after the couple's release...

1434
01:17:07,998 --> 01:17:09,959
...a message from a band of kidnappers...

1435
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:12,212
<i>...that was received earlier, </i>
<i>demanding a ransom...</i>

1436
01:17:12,254 --> 01:17:14,088
<i>...of one million dollars.</i>

1437
01:17:14,131 --> 01:17:17,300
<i>Yes, a million dollars to release--</i>

1438
01:17:17,342 --> 01:17:18,843
What do you think, boss?

1439
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:21,304
It's all going very well.

1440
01:17:21,346 --> 01:17:23,639
...this represents an
exorbitant amount, given...

1441
01:17:23,681 --> 01:17:26,309
...the economic crisis
the family is going through.

1442
01:17:28,520 --> 01:17:30,522
But it wasn't all
bad news, Javier...

1443
01:17:31,356 --> 01:17:34,234
...this afternoon
after hearing about...

1444
01:17:34,276 --> 01:17:36,986
...the kidnap, the State
Governor was outraged...

1445
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:40,240
...and setting a great example,
together with the parents...

1446
01:17:40,282 --> 01:17:43,201
...he sent the following,
message to society.

1447
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,788
Are you ready Governor?
I remind you are going live.

1448
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:51,667
OK, silence please.
We're on in five...

1449
01:17:51,959 --> 01:17:53,919
...four, three...

1450
01:17:55,297 --> 01:17:58,341
Fellow citizens...

1451
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:01,719
...the authority vested on me...

1452
01:18:02,304 --> 01:18:04,096
...through democratic vote...

1453
01:18:04,138 --> 01:18:06,349
...implies a great responsibility.

1454
01:18:07,517 --> 01:18:10,144
Being in charge of a State such as ours...

1455
01:18:10,520 --> 01:18:13,356
...entails happiness and heartaches.

1456
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:16,568
But when the will to serve comes first...

1457
01:18:17,109 --> 01:18:19,945
...one can leave behind rumors and lies...

1458
01:18:20,447 --> 01:18:23,782
...and focus on what is really important.

1459
01:18:25,285 --> 01:18:27,912
<i>I was informed, moments ago...</i>

1460
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,289
<i>...by my collaborators...</i>

1461
01:18:29,331 --> 01:18:31,749
<i>...of the terrible news </i>
<i>about twins Ana and Elena...</i>

1462
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:33,501
<i>...Garza's kidnapping.</i>

1463
01:18:33,751 --> 01:18:36,421
<i>I want to inform you </i>
<i>that starting today...</i>

1464
01:18:36,463 --> 01:18:38,465
<i>...and until they appear </i>
<i>safe and sound...</i>

1465
01:18:39,089 --> 01:18:42,009
...all the resources
available to the State...

1466
01:18:42,051 --> 01:18:43,844
...will be focused on...

1467
01:18:43,886 --> 01:18:45,888
...achieving such a noble task.

1468
01:18:46,096 --> 01:18:49,226
I also want to take this opportunity...

1469
01:18:49,267 --> 01:18:52,019
...to send a message of amity...

1470
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,313
...to my fellow countrymen.

1471
01:18:53,771 --> 01:18:55,523
<i>And assure the parents...</i>

1472
01:18:55,565 --> 01:18:58,610
<i>...of the girls that I will not rest...</i>

1473
01:18:58,652 --> 01:19:01,655
...until they are reunited,
with their beautiful daughters.

1474
01:19:02,530 --> 01:19:04,282
You have my word.

1475
01:19:06,534 --> 01:19:07,826
Thank you very much.

1476
01:19:08,328 --> 01:19:10,664
And so Javier, after this moving...

1477
01:19:10,705 --> 01:19:13,416
...and emotional message by
Governor Vargas, that...

1478
01:19:13,458 --> 01:19:15,377
...truth be said is a rare
event for a politician...

1479
01:19:15,418 --> 01:19:19,004
...to appear concerned and humane.
I will now sign off...

1480
01:19:19,046 --> 01:19:22,676
...not before sharing,
this heartbreaking image...

1481
01:19:22,883 --> 01:19:26,304
...of a couple that, in adversity...

1482
01:19:26,346 --> 01:19:28,806
...have rediscovered lost love.

1483
01:19:29,974 --> 01:19:31,393
Good night.

1484
01:19:32,101 --> 01:19:33,520
Cheers, gentlemen!

1485
01:19:34,228 --> 01:19:37,982
I told you, selling my ass
to those sons of bitches...

1486
01:19:38,023 --> 01:19:41,026
...on TV, has been the best
investment made by my government.

1487
01:19:41,068 --> 01:19:42,069
Hasn't it?

1488
01:19:42,111 --> 01:19:44,322
The truth Governor,
I can clearly see your future...

1489
01:19:44,364 --> 01:19:46,991
...as our next President.

1490
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:48,743
Congratulations, godfather.

1491
01:19:48,784 --> 01:19:51,579
You showed the three qualities
it takes to be President...

1492
01:19:51,621 --> 01:19:54,039
...honesty, intelligence and
sensitivity, godfather.

1493
01:19:54,832 --> 01:19:56,834
Mr. Governor, it's an honor.

1494
01:19:57,167 --> 01:20:01,130
Compadre, I'm very proud
to be a part of your team.

1495
01:20:01,171 --> 01:20:04,718
You'll go far with me, but it's
all thanks to this boy.

1496
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,177
This guy really knows his shit.

1497
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,555
Come here, boy. Come here.

1498
01:20:09,972 --> 01:20:13,518
-Congratulations, you've done well.
-Thanks Governor...

1499
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:15,478
...let me tell you
that even I was surprised.

1500
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:18,606
Congratulations, Governor
you were great, great.

1501
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:19,898
-Enormous!
-Ok, enough, enough.

1502
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:23,361
Enough with the ass kissing, let's
go find some escorts and celebrate.

1503
01:20:23,819 --> 01:20:26,489
I hope now you do join us...

1504
01:20:26,531 --> 01:20:28,282
-...my dear Carlitos.
-Jeez, Governor...

1505
01:20:28,325 --> 01:20:30,159
...don't think wrong of me,
again, but I have to...

1506
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,911
...go back to the Garza's
home to supervise everything.

1507
01:20:33,455 --> 01:20:36,123
I don't think bad of you, you stud.

1508
01:20:38,250 --> 01:20:40,670
I know you're fucking Jazmin.

1509
01:20:41,211 --> 01:20:43,213
The foxiest chick in this country.

1510
01:20:43,757 --> 01:20:45,425
Hey Governor, who told you that?

1511
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:48,844
Dude, did you think I wouldn't
do a background check on you?

1512
01:20:49,219 --> 01:20:53,265
If there weren't any witnesses,
I swear I would blow you.

1513
01:20:53,641 --> 01:20:57,061
Just imagining where you've been
dunking your sausage in.

1514
01:20:57,604 --> 01:21:00,815
Jazmincita is and will be,
the girl of my dreams.

1515
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:03,443
-With your permission, Governor.
-Please.

Wouldn't it be good
to do it once and for all?

Why don't we send them some fingers...

...or some of the girls' ears?

1524

To put some pressure on them.

don't let them hurt the girls.

1547
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,603
But I know who will tell me the truth.

1548
01:22:28,944 --> 01:22:30,112
Alfonso...

1549
01:22:35,159 --> 01:22:37,495
-Mister.
-Thanks.

1550
01:22:47,004 --> 01:22:49,591
-I can't take it anymore.
-I already told you Richard...

1551
01:22:49,841 --> 01:22:53,553
...more than 35 rating points,
only in the soccer finals...

1552
01:22:53,595 --> 01:22:54,970
...and we are about to achieve it.

1553
01:22:55,012 --> 01:22:56,972
I just got off the phone with,
Pepe and he told me...

1554
01:22:57,014 --> 01:22:59,308
-...Don Alejandro is very happy.
-Well of course, but there is a big...

1555
01:22:59,349 --> 01:23:01,478
...difference between that
and having to stay to live here.

1556
01:23:01,895 --> 01:23:05,105
I'm feeling horny tonight,
I have plans with some chicks.

1557
01:23:05,147 --> 01:23:07,149
Richard, think this over.

1558
01:23:07,399 --> 01:23:09,234
We are about to make history...

1559
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:10,986
...on Mexican TV
and you are complaining.

1560
01:23:11,905 --> 01:23:14,364
Any moment now
the kidnappers can call...

1561
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:16,283
...imagine that going live.

1562
01:23:16,743 --> 01:23:19,161
There is no doubt that you're sick.

1563
01:23:23,500 --> 01:23:26,961
OK, I'll have to make due
with what I can.

1564
01:23:47,941 --> 01:23:48,983
What happened, Ricardo?

1565
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:50,860
Nothing, I'm worried, how are you?

1566
01:23:51,945 --> 01:23:53,780
Ricardo, what do you want me to say?

1567
01:23:54,989 --> 01:23:57,534
I'm desperate and I feel all alone.

1568
01:23:57,867 --> 01:24:00,410
I think you need to get it off your chest.

1569
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:03,038
Come, let's talk.

1570
01:24:23,350 --> 01:24:24,936
Good night, Congressman.

1571
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:26,854
Here are the documents.

1572
01:24:27,689 --> 01:24:29,816
You don't know how 
hard it was to get them.

1573
01:24:29,857 --> 01:24:30,942
Thanks, son.

1574
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:33,653
Here's the money,
if you want to count it.

1575
01:24:37,197 --> 01:24:38,950
I suppose it's fine, as always.

1576
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,410
I wanted to ask a favor,
Congressman.

1577
01:24:41,869 --> 01:24:44,079
Please be more discreet this time.

1578
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:46,708
This is even more delicate
than the videos.

1579
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:49,794
Don't worry, mum's the word.

1580
01:24:49,836 --> 01:24:52,296
I remind you my offer is still in place...

1581
01:24:52,337 --> 01:24:54,048
...for you to join the party.

1582
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:57,551
-We need people like you.
-Thanks.

1583
01:24:58,052 --> 01:24:59,721
There'll be time to talk about that.

1584
01:25:00,554 --> 01:25:01,388
Good luck.

1585
01:25:17,071 --> 01:25:18,196
That's it!

1586
01:25:28,290 --> 01:25:29,124
Yes?

1587
01:25:29,499 --> 01:25:31,794
<i>-Don Carlos? </i>
-Yes.

1588
01:25:31,836 --> 01:25:35,006
-This is Congressman Morales.
-Congressman, how are you?

1589
01:25:35,547 --> 01:25:37,675
Why didn't you keep your promise?

1590
01:25:38,092 --> 01:25:40,053
Look, I'm sorry, I don't know...
why they didn't air...

1591
01:25:40,094 --> 01:25:41,846
...the videos,
you have to understand...

1592
01:25:41,888 --> 01:25:43,513
...I'm not the one who
makes those calls.

1593
01:25:43,765 --> 01:25:46,017
<i>I need to see you urgently, </i>
<i>I have something...</i>

1594
01:25:46,059 --> 01:25:48,019
<i>...that you can't deny airing.</i>

1595
01:25:48,268 --> 01:25:49,353
What do you have?

1596
01:25:49,394 --> 01:25:52,606
Something that links your station
with Governor Vargas.

1597
01:25:53,273 --> 01:25:57,486
<i>I'm sure it will put your </i>
<i>bosses in an uncomfortable situation.</i>

1598
01:25:57,987 --> 01:26:00,280
OK, Congressman
where shall I see you?

1599
01:26:00,907 --> 01:26:02,366
In the Congress.

1600
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:05,828
9:00 sharp tomorrow.

1601
01:26:06,829 --> 01:26:08,497
<i>OK, I'll see you there.</i>

1602
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,041
Good night.

1603
01:26:10,582 --> 01:26:11,583
Good night.

1604
01:26:21,468 --> 01:26:24,638
Good morning, Don Carlos,
thank you for being on time!

1605
01:26:25,180 --> 01:26:27,182
Tell me Congressman,
how can I help you?

1606
01:26:27,224 --> 01:26:29,184
You're probably wondering
why I asked you to come here...

1607
01:26:29,226 --> 01:26:30,937
-...right?
-I don't know, I guess...

1608
01:26:30,978 --> 01:26:33,230
-...because you work here.
-No, no Don Carlos.

1609
01:26:33,690 --> 01:26:36,566
I asked you here because this place
represents much more than...

1610
01:26:36,608 --> 01:26:38,610
...just a simple hall of congress.

1611
01:26:39,904 --> 01:26:43,198
This Congress, however humble...

1612
01:26:43,240 --> 01:26:44,533
...you may find it...

1613
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:47,829
...is the last hope...

1614
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:52,457
...for many people like me
that are fed up with impunity...

1615
01:26:52,499 --> 01:26:54,168
...and the corruption and the lies--

1616
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,795
Bravo Congressman, bravo!
The truth is...

1617
01:26:55,837 --> 01:26:58,463
...I didn't bring the cameras, and I don't
know where you're going with this.

1618
01:26:58,923 --> 01:27:01,843
You and your bosses must think
that I'm an idiot, right?

1619
01:27:01,884 --> 01:27:05,012
A small town Congressman
who you can treat...

1620
01:27:05,054 --> 01:27:06,139
...as your puppet.

1621
01:27:07,264 --> 01:27:08,808
No, Congressman...

1622
01:27:09,142 --> 01:27:09,976
...not quite.

1623
01:27:10,684 --> 01:27:12,269
Well you're wrong Don Carlos.

1624
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:15,857
Haven't you heard the saying
there is no small enemy?

1625
01:27:16,523 --> 01:27:18,567
Or are you going to deny
that this is the reason...

1626
01:27:18,608 --> 01:27:20,235
...you are thwarting me.

1627
01:27:20,569 --> 01:27:23,613
And you have been protecting
that corrupt Vargas.

1628
01:27:24,698 --> 01:27:27,659
These are copies of
the contracts that our honorable...

1629
01:27:27,701 --> 01:27:30,495
...Governor signed with your firm.

1630
01:27:30,872 --> 01:27:33,875
Do you want me to believe
that story of the twins?

1631
01:27:33,916 --> 01:27:36,376
And that your station
is presenting the Governor...

1632
01:27:36,418 --> 01:27:38,587
...as a champion of justice
in prime time...

1633
01:27:38,628 --> 01:27:40,714
-...for nothing?
-You're wrong, Congressman...

1634
01:27:40,757 --> 01:27:43,050
...those contracts
are commercial agreements...

1635
01:27:43,633 --> 01:27:45,385
...that we have with almost every state...

1636
01:27:45,427 --> 01:27:49,056
-...including the federal government.
-Don't insult my intelligence.

1637
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:51,976
Do you know what your enemies
or your rivals would give...

1638
01:27:52,018 --> 01:27:53,978
...for this information?
Just think...

1639
01:27:54,187 --> 01:27:56,605
...what would to the shares of
your company in the stock market?

1640
01:27:56,646 --> 01:27:58,523
-Do you want to blackmail us?
-No!

1641
01:27:59,316 --> 01:28:00,442
No, Don Carlos!

1642
01:28:00,860 --> 01:28:02,904
Not everyone is as corrupt as you are...

1643
01:28:02,945 --> 01:28:04,362
...thank God in this country...

1644
01:28:04,404 --> 01:28:06,783
...there are still some 
honorable politicians.

1645
01:28:06,824 --> 01:28:09,035
OK, Congressman
cut to the chase, what do you want?

1646
01:28:09,451 --> 01:28:10,953
What I want, which is also my right...

1647
01:28:10,995 --> 01:28:12,830
...guaranteed by the Constitution...

1648
01:28:12,872 --> 01:28:15,041
...is a space in Perez-Harris'
news broadcast...

1649
01:28:15,082 --> 01:28:17,210
...to present the evidence I have
against the Governor.

1650
01:28:17,417 --> 01:28:20,295
Ten minutes, on prime time
and not a minute less.

1651
01:28:20,420 --> 01:28:21,964
You say you don't 
want to blackmail me...

1652
01:28:22,006 --> 01:28:24,633
...do you have any idea how much
10 minutes of prime time are worth?

1653
01:28:26,803 --> 01:28:28,805
I have no doubt that cynicism...

1654
01:28:28,846 --> 01:28:31,389
...is the editorial line of your station.

1655
01:28:33,226 --> 01:28:36,854
I'll leave you alone in this hall
of democracy so you can think.

1656
01:28:39,439 --> 01:28:41,608
I'll wait for your call, before midday.

1657
01:28:43,610 --> 01:28:45,695
Otherwise, tell your bosses...

1658
01:28:45,737 --> 01:28:48,241
...to suffer the consequences.

1659
01:29:09,095 --> 01:29:10,720
Good morning, Lupita.
Put Pepe on the line.

1660
01:29:10,762 --> 01:29:11,973
<i>He's in a meeting.</i>

1661
01:29:12,223 --> 01:29:13,473
I don't care, tell him it's urgent.

1662
01:29:15,226 --> 01:29:16,351
What do you want Carlos?

1663
01:29:16,810 --> 01:29:18,938
Sorry to interrupt Pepe, we're in deep shit.

1664
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:20,355
<i>Did something happen to the twins?</i>

1665
01:29:20,438 --> 01:29:21,858
No, no, that's all fine.

1666
01:29:22,607 --> 01:29:24,359
<i>The leader of Congress...</i>

1667
01:29:24,401 --> 01:29:26,153
<i>...got a hold of our </i>
<i>contracts with the Governor...</i>

1668
01:29:26,195 --> 01:29:28,030
<i>...and is about to go public with them.</i>

1669
01:29:28,322 --> 01:29:30,490
Son of a bitch!
How did he get them?

1670
01:29:30,992 --> 01:29:33,160
I haven't the faintest idea.

1671
01:29:34,161 --> 01:29:36,788
Offer him some money.
I'm sure that's what he wants...

1672
01:29:36,830 --> 01:29:38,790
...those cocksuckers
are all the same.

1673
01:29:39,083 --> 01:29:40,458
<i>No, the problem is </i>
<i>he doesn't want money.</i>

1674
01:29:40,500 --> 01:29:44,171
What do you mean? You probably
didn't ask him right.

1675
01:29:45,839 --> 01:29:48,383
He wants 10 minutes
with Perez-Harris...

1676
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:51,386
...to talk about all the shit
he has on the Governor.

1677
01:29:51,845 --> 01:29:54,806
OK, listen to me carefully,
this is what you're going to do.

1678
01:29:55,016 --> 01:29:57,935
You are telling this motherfucker
that he can have anything he wants.

1679
01:29:58,019 --> 01:30:00,021
I'll deal with the rest,
do you understand?

1680
01:30:00,604 --> 01:30:02,106
<i>OK, I'll let him know then.</i>

1681
01:30:02,522 --> 01:30:05,567
You call me immediately
after you talk to this fucking bastard.

1682
01:30:06,319 --> 01:30:07,361
OK! Thanks.

1683
01:30:11,573 --> 01:30:14,035
<i>Mr. Harman, </i>
<i>the President is on the line.</i>

1684
01:30:19,081 --> 01:30:20,207
<i>What's going on Pepe?</i>

1685
01:30:20,249 --> 01:30:22,293
What's up Mr. President,
how are you?

1686
01:30:22,335 --> 01:30:23,752
<i>Fine thanks. Tell me.</i>

1687
01:30:23,793 --> 01:30:25,670
I have a problem,
I need your help.

1688
01:30:25,922 --> 01:30:26,880
<i>How can I help you?</i>

1689
01:30:27,131 --> 01:30:29,091
Some contracts were leaked...

1690
01:30:29,133 --> 01:30:31,468
...involving our firm, and a guy
named Agustin Morales...

1691
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:32,929
...wants to blackmail us.

1692
01:30:33,803 --> 01:30:34,931
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

1693
01:30:35,222 --> 01:30:36,349
What do you mean what?

1694
01:30:36,514 --> 01:30:37,934
Get your lackeys to work...

1695
01:30:37,975 --> 01:30:39,517
...and send us all you've got on him.

1696
01:30:39,977 --> 01:30:42,229
<i>OK, I'll tell the </i>
<i>Secretary of the Interior...</i>

1697
01:30:42,271 --> 01:30:43,897
<i>...see what he's got, </i>
<i>and I'll let you know.</i>

1698
01:30:44,065 --> 01:30:46,650
But I need it before
5:00 this afternoon.

1699
01:30:46,691 --> 01:30:47,734
It's urgent.

1700
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:49,569
Send it over with the general,
here to my office.

1701
01:30:49,611 --> 01:30:51,529
<i>Yes Pepe, don't worry </i>
<i>I'll let you know.</i>

1702
01:30:51,655 --> 01:30:53,032
One last thing.

1703
01:30:53,074 --> 01:30:54,075
<i>What's up?</i>

1704
01:30:54,824 --> 01:30:57,119
Who is taking care of your ties?

1705
01:30:58,037 --> 01:30:59,038
<i>Why?</i>

1706
01:30:59,163 --> 01:31:01,706
You look like a portrait, dude,
I'm going to send you some new ones.

1707
01:31:03,084 --> 01:31:04,126
You're on.

1708
01:31:04,459 --> 01:31:05,294
Take care.

1709
01:31:05,336 --> 01:31:06,836
<i>Take care, Pepe.</i>

1710
01:31:11,925 --> 01:31:13,885
<i>So then, it's clear isn't it Carlitos?</i>

1711
01:31:14,095 --> 01:31:16,680
-Crystal clear, Pepe.
-You have the transcript?

1712
01:31:16,721 --> 01:31:18,975
-Is it ready?
-When I can I'll show it...

1713
01:31:19,016 --> 01:31:20,600
...to the Governor and
tell him this information...

1714
01:31:20,642 --> 01:31:21,978
...comes straight
from the Secretary of Interior.

1715
01:31:22,019 --> 01:31:23,980
<i>Then I'll take care of the Governor...</i>

1716
01:31:24,021 --> 01:31:25,814
<i>...and you take care </i>
<i>of Congressman Morales.</i>

1717
01:31:26,357 --> 01:31:27,732
What do you know about Morales?

1718
01:31:27,984 --> 01:31:30,403
<i>I told him he has to be </i>
<i>in the studio at 8:00.</i>

1719
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,487
Perfect.

1720
01:31:33,613 --> 01:31:35,865
<i>Look Carlitos, I'm going to </i>
<i>need you at the top of your game.</i>

1721
01:31:36,325 --> 01:31:37,951
I'm going to need you to do
two things at the same time...

1722
01:31:37,994 --> 01:31:40,413
...and keep an eye on both,
the Governor and the twins.

1723
01:31:40,829 --> 01:31:42,789
Can I count on you with this?

1724
01:31:43,207 --> 01:31:46,043
<i>Don't worry boss, I'll </i>
<i>have something for you tonight.</i>

1725
01:31:46,626 --> 01:31:48,295
That's the spirit! Take care.

1726
01:31:51,298 --> 01:31:52,299
<i>Alfonso?</i>

1727
01:31:52,924 --> 01:31:55,136
<i>Good evening Congressman, </i>
<i>how can I help you?</i>

1728
01:31:55,428 --> 01:31:57,304
<i>I need your help again.</i>

1729
01:31:58,180 --> 01:32:00,099
<i>What is it this time, sir?</i>

1730
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:03,227
<i>Do you know if our friend...</i>

1731
01:32:03,269 --> 01:32:05,396
<i>...has an agreement </i>
<i>with the TV network?</i>

1732
01:32:06,188 --> 01:32:09,816
<i>I know something... but </i>
<i>this is a delicate topic.</i>

1733
01:32:10,276 --> 01:32:11,818
<i>How delicate?</i>

1734
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:14,155
<i>Doubly delicate than last time...</i>

1735
01:32:14,654 --> 01:32:16,698
<i>...plus the rest we had  </i>
<i>already agreed on.</i>

1736
01:32:16,740 --> 01:32:18,700
<i>OK, but I need it today.</i>

1737
01:32:19,243 --> 01:32:21,786
<i>I'll see you in the same place at 12:30</i>

1738
01:32:21,828 --> 01:32:23,955
<i>OK, son. </i>
<i>See you there.</i>

1739
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,959
You see dickhead?

1740
01:32:28,335 --> 01:32:30,504
If we would have finished
with that sucker Morales...

1741
01:32:30,545 --> 01:32:32,089
...this wouldn't have happened.

1742
01:32:32,131 --> 01:32:33,715
They'll deal with that in Mexico now.

1743
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:36,593
What we have to stop are the filtrations...

1744
01:32:36,634 --> 01:32:39,096
...and unfortunately it has to be him.

1745
01:32:39,138 --> 01:32:41,639
But who gave those tapes to your boss?

1746
01:32:41,681 --> 01:32:45,018
Either the Secretariat of the Interior
or the office of the President.

1747
01:32:45,061 --> 01:32:47,146
Motherfuckers!

1748
01:32:47,188 --> 01:32:50,774
And I thought he was worth
bringing in from the Green Party.

1749
01:32:52,234 --> 01:32:53,194
Rosita.

1750
01:32:53,235 --> 01:32:54,111
<i>Yes sir.</i>

1751
01:32:54,652 --> 01:32:56,029
Tell my godson to come in.

1752
01:32:56,072 --> 01:32:57,448
<i>Of course, sir.</i>

1753
01:32:57,490 --> 01:32:59,949
OK Governor, I'll leave you
I have to finish the story...

1754
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,410
-...for tonight.
-No, no, no, no.

1755
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:03,703
Stay here.

1756
01:33:04,163 --> 01:33:06,998
So you see how things are
taken care of in this country.

1757
01:33:07,040 --> 01:33:09,667
Sit down.
It won't be long.

1758
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:17,510
May I, godfather?
What's up, Carlos?

1759
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:18,968
Sit down, Poncho.

1760
01:33:24,517 --> 01:33:25,892
Let's see, Poncho.

1761
01:33:27,060 --> 01:33:30,397
Carlitos here just told me
that it's you who is...

1762
01:33:30,439 --> 01:33:33,442
...giving information
to Congressman Morales.

1763
01:33:34,401 --> 01:33:35,402
What do you have 
to say about that?

1764
01:33:36,237 --> 01:33:38,239
Are you really going to
believe that about me?

1765
01:33:38,489 --> 01:33:41,492
Son, I just heard a tape
recording of you and...

1766
01:33:41,534 --> 01:33:43,952
...that fucking Messiah
where it's very clear.

1767
01:33:45,078 --> 01:33:47,080
Haven't I been good to you?

1768
01:33:47,373 --> 01:33:49,500
Haven't I treated you like a son?

1769
01:33:49,542 --> 01:33:50,792
Of course, godfather.

1770
01:33:51,127 --> 01:33:53,628
How can you believe I would
do such a thing to you?

1771
01:33:53,878 --> 01:33:55,339
Motherfucker!

1772
01:33:55,797 --> 01:33:57,799
The information comes
directly from the President!

1773
01:33:58,300 --> 01:34:00,093
Please, forgive me.

1774
01:34:00,136 --> 01:34:02,388
I know I was wrong,
I didn't mean to...

1775
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:03,721
...I have a lot of debts.

1776
01:34:09,894 --> 01:34:11,480
Son of a bitch!

1777
01:34:12,105 --> 01:34:13,898
You didn't mean to?

1778
01:34:14,899 --> 01:34:17,278
I knew this yuppie would betray me.

1779
01:34:20,947 --> 01:34:24,659
Well, Carlitos, now we have
one less problem.

1780
01:34:25,785 --> 01:34:27,454
Now you can go to work.

1781
01:34:28,497 --> 01:34:30,957
Oh, and just to be clear...

1782
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:35,086
...please make sure that
nothing goes wrong with the girls.

1783
01:34:36,463 --> 01:34:37,339
OK?

1784
01:34:39,592 --> 01:34:40,551
Yes, Governor.

1785
01:34:53,606 --> 01:34:57,610
<i>The potato was in the pan--</i>

1786
01:34:57,651 --> 01:35:00,279
<i>I'm going into town to call from a payphone.</i>

1787
01:35:01,154 --> 01:35:04,450
Keep an eye out and watch the girls.

1788
01:35:05,158 --> 01:35:09,120
And do not start drinking
or doing any funny business.

1789
01:35:09,162 --> 01:35:11,039
Don't worry boss.

1790
01:35:11,080 --> 01:35:13,708
If I'm not here in a couple of hours.

1791
01:35:14,418 --> 01:35:16,670
You know what to do.
OK?

1792
01:35:17,213 --> 01:35:18,547
Yes, boss.

1793
01:35:18,589 --> 01:35:20,131
But, do you think we are rookies?

1794
01:35:20,173 --> 01:35:23,843
I'm not saying you're rookies,
I'm saying your stupid.

1795
01:35:26,012 --> 01:35:27,514
And watch Doña Chole...

1796
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:30,643
...that whore has taken 
a liking to the girls.

1797
01:35:35,231 --> 01:35:38,651
<i>The potato was in the pan...</i>

1798
01:35:39,150 --> 01:35:40,818
<i>...it had a lot of oil...</i>

1799
01:36:07,971 --> 01:36:09,598
<i>Don't cry, Jazmin!</i>

1800
01:36:11,099 --> 01:36:13,352
-Castulo Servin.
-Yes?

1801
01:36:14,102 --> 01:36:15,061
This is for ratting!

1802
01:36:18,898 --> 01:36:20,900
<i>She's right...</i>

1803
01:36:22,528 --> 01:36:24,488
<i>...it better that I leave this house...</i>

1804
01:36:24,738 --> 01:36:25,739
<i>No, Jazmin!</i>

1805
01:36:26,615 --> 01:36:28,325
<i>She will go first!</i>

1806
01:36:28,992 --> 01:36:30,827
<i>Don't forget the promise </i>
<i>that you made to my father.</i>

1807
01:36:35,541 --> 01:36:37,125
<i>What would the terms be?</i>

1808
01:36:45,676 --> 01:36:47,511
No, thank you...

1809
01:36:47,553 --> 01:36:49,555
...I have no collateral...

1810
01:36:49,596 --> 01:36:52,849
...besides, 150% interest
is abusive, thank you.

1811
01:36:54,768 --> 01:36:56,395
What happened, Salvador,
how are you doing on the money front?

1812
01:36:56,437 --> 01:36:59,272
Very bad.
I've mortgaged my house to your bank.

1813
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,150
I sold the car and Lucia's jewelry.

1814
01:37:02,693 --> 01:37:05,820
I asked for a loan which I'll be
paying for the rest of my life...

1815
01:37:05,862 --> 01:37:07,822
...and I only have

1816
01:37:07,864 --> 01:37:10,199
Let me see how we can help you out...

1817
01:37:10,241 --> 01:37:12,910
...at the firm, but put me
down for 25 thousand.

1818
01:37:13,329 --> 01:37:14,413
Thank you.

1819
01:37:14,455 --> 01:37:17,666
I've really changed my mind
about your network.

1820
01:37:18,334 --> 01:37:19,917
That's alright.

1821
01:37:20,586 --> 01:37:22,920
Don't answer.
Toño, Martin!

1822
01:37:23,464 --> 01:37:24,297
Come on!

1823
01:37:26,299 --> 01:37:27,468
<i>I'm here with you!</i>

1824
01:37:30,219 --> 01:37:31,220
Chava...

1825
01:37:33,222 --> 01:37:34,057
Are you ready?

1826
01:37:34,223 --> 01:37:35,058
OK, now.

1827
01:37:36,309 --> 01:37:37,143
Hello...

1828
01:37:37,226 --> 01:37:40,731
What is happening motherfucker?
Do you have all my dough?

1829
01:37:41,105 --> 01:37:43,442
No, I've just got
300 thousand dollars, but...

1830
01:37:43,484 --> 01:37:44,651
...I'm going to get it all.

1831
01:37:44,901 --> 01:37:46,487
Listen to me you asshole!

1832
01:37:46,528 --> 01:37:48,905
If you think I'm fooling around,
you are very wrong motherfucker.

1833
01:37:49,155 --> 01:37:52,075
I told you very clearly
not to pull this kind of shit.

1834
01:37:52,576 --> 01:37:55,579
I'm going to rape them, and
then I'll send you their fingers...

1835
01:37:55,621 --> 01:37:57,498
...to prove I'm not
playing around, asshole.

1836
01:37:57,790 --> 01:38:00,459
Please, for the love of God
don't hurt my girls...

1837
01:38:00,501 --> 01:38:02,251
...give me two more days
and I'll get the money...

1838
01:38:02,293 --> 01:38:05,547
...but don't... hurt our daughters.
This is--

1839
01:38:11,678 --> 01:38:16,182
THE NIGHTMARE SEEMS ENDLESS

1840
01:38:18,226 --> 01:38:20,019
You'll have to forgive me...

1841
01:38:20,854 --> 01:38:22,606
...tonight for, contrary to my custom...

1842
01:38:22,648 --> 01:38:24,899
...expressing a personal opinion...

1843
01:38:24,941 --> 01:38:26,275
...about what we just saw.

1844
01:38:27,985 --> 01:38:29,738
Very few times in the 20 odd years...

1845
01:38:29,780 --> 01:38:31,490
...that I've been in front of
this broadcast...

1846
01:38:32,408 --> 01:38:34,242
...have I ever felt such a deep outrage...

1847
01:38:34,493 --> 01:38:36,495
...and such helplessness that I'm sure...

1848
01:38:37,579 --> 01:38:38,831
...you are also feeling.

1849
01:38:41,625 --> 01:38:43,042
Think for a moment...

1850
01:38:43,084 --> 01:38:45,169
...what the parents of these
girls must be going through...

1851
01:38:45,211 --> 01:38:48,632
...and I'm sure that you'll
feel very moved.

1852
01:38:52,553 --> 01:38:54,805
That is why on behalf
of Television Mexicana...

1853
01:38:55,179 --> 01:38:57,808
...Telebank and the
"Yes we can" Foundation,

1854
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:00,017
We want to make an appeal
to show support...

1855
01:39:00,059 --> 01:39:02,604
...with these parents,
and as a token of our support...

1856
01:39:02,771 --> 01:39:04,731
...we invite you to wear a yellow ribbon...

1857
01:39:04,773 --> 01:39:08,401
...and make a donation
to the account shown on your screen.

1858
01:39:10,278 --> 01:39:14,031
<i>I remind you, it's not </i>
<i>important if it's one or two pesos.</i>

1859
01:39:14,741 --> 01:39:17,786
<i>What's important </i>
<i>is the solidarity...</i>

1860
01:39:18,745 --> 01:39:20,664
<i>...we have in cases like these.</i>

1861
01:39:21,582 --> 01:39:22,624
<i>Thank you, very much.</i>

1862
01:39:22,666 --> 01:39:25,001
Jeez Carlos, I really appreciate this.

1863
01:39:25,042 --> 01:39:27,629
You'll see it will work out and
tomorrow you'll have all the money.

1864
01:39:27,671 --> 01:39:30,883
Javier is a master at
touching peoples' hearts.

1865
01:39:30,924 --> 01:39:33,301
Every time he asks for donations
whether for floods...

1866
01:39:33,342 --> 01:39:35,721
...earthquakes, or
street children, it's impressive.

1867
01:39:35,762 --> 01:39:37,221
He always surpasses his target.

1868
01:39:38,097 --> 01:39:40,559
Don Carlos, someone is looking
for the parents.

1869
01:39:40,601 --> 01:39:43,060
-Who is it?
-The next-door neighbors.

1870
01:39:44,437 --> 01:39:47,524
-Can we go?
-Yes please, go, go.

1871
01:39:47,900 --> 01:39:53,822
<i>Loss of jobs, abandoned homes, and </i>
<i>violence is a threat to national security...</i>

1872
01:39:53,864 --> 01:39:57,659
<i>...they are the result of the current  </i>
<i>strategy against drugs in our country.</i>

1873
01:40:01,497 --> 01:40:03,499
Good evening, Luisa, what's up?

1874
01:40:03,540 --> 01:40:06,083
Good evening Lucia, Salvador,
we just found out...

1875
01:40:06,334 --> 01:40:07,920
...what happened on TV.

1876
01:40:07,961 --> 01:40:11,214
We brought this, it's not much,
but we hope it helps.

1877
01:40:11,464 --> 01:40:12,423
Thank you very much.

1878
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:14,760
Luisa.

1879
01:40:18,514 --> 01:40:19,347
Thanks.

1880
01:40:21,265 --> 01:40:22,893
Thanks a lot.

1881
01:40:23,226 --> 01:40:25,394
Come, the best is yet to come.

1882
01:40:34,571 --> 01:40:36,740
Good evening Congressman,
don't get up.

1883
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,910
Good evening Mr. Harman,
nice to meet you.

1884
01:40:40,243 --> 01:40:42,538
I've been checking
the stuff you brought us.

1885
01:40:42,955 --> 01:40:44,413
It's very strong.

1886
01:40:44,873 --> 01:40:47,876
I would like to apologise to you.

1887
01:40:47,918 --> 01:40:49,753
I'm very sorry to have to
resort to these methods...

1888
01:40:49,795 --> 01:40:52,046
-...to get the interview.
-You don't have to apologize...

1889
01:40:52,673 --> 01:40:54,340
As a matter of fact, believe it or not...

1890
01:40:54,716 --> 01:40:56,217
...I share your goal.

1891
01:40:56,677 --> 01:40:59,345
This country needs
brave people such as yourself...

1892
01:40:59,387 --> 01:41:01,472
...willing to denounce
corruption and impunity.

1893
01:41:02,515 --> 01:41:03,725
I appreciate that.

1894
01:41:04,058 --> 01:41:05,518
Are you being taken care of,
do you need anything?

1895
01:41:05,561 --> 01:41:06,812
No, everything is fine.

1896
01:41:06,853 --> 01:41:08,437
Well, in a few moments
they'll come and get you.

1897
01:41:09,063 --> 01:41:12,149
-Nice to meet you and good luck.
-Thank you.

1898
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:20,784
<i>And before we go </i>
<i>we have a special guest tonight...</i>

1899
01:41:20,826 --> 01:41:23,954
<i>Tonight, Congressman </i>
<i>Agustin Morales will join us...</i>

1900
01:41:23,996 --> 01:41:26,372
<i>...you'll remember him </i>
<i>as one of the most...</i>

1901
01:41:26,414 --> 01:41:28,332
<i>...harsh critics of </i>
<i>Governor Carmelo Vargas...</i>

1902
01:41:28,667 --> 01:41:31,670
<i>...who has a very important </i>
<i>revelation for us.</i>

1903
01:41:31,712 --> 01:41:33,589
-Good evening, Congressman.
-Good evening, Javier.

1904
01:41:33,839 --> 01:41:35,298
Thank you for the opportunity.

1905
01:41:36,257 --> 01:41:39,052
<i>Congressman before we show...</i>

1906
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:40,804
<i>...the tape you brought us...</i>

1907
01:41:40,846 --> 01:41:43,890
...and share your viewpoint,
I would like to ask you a question.

1908
01:41:44,473 --> 01:41:45,349
Go on, Javier.

1909
01:41:45,726 --> 01:41:48,561
What does the name
Cinthia Gonzalez mean to you?

1910
01:41:50,354 --> 01:41:52,691
Cinthia Gonzalez?
Well, not much.

1911
01:41:53,357 --> 01:41:55,151
If I recall correctly
she's the daughter of a lady...

1912
01:41:55,192 --> 01:41:56,444
...that worked in my house.

1913
01:41:57,528 --> 01:41:59,405
I don't see how that is relevant.

1914
01:41:59,865 --> 01:42:01,867
Well, to refresh your memory...

1915
01:42:01,908 --> 01:42:03,744
...why don't we watch
this testimony?

1916
01:42:05,369 --> 01:42:06,788
<i>I met Mr. Morales...</i>

1917
01:42:06,830 --> 01:42:09,165
<i>...because my mom worked as his maid...</i>

1918
01:42:10,458 --> 01:42:13,920
...since we got there, he
was always very nice to me.

1919
01:42:14,378 --> 01:42:16,130
He always gave me many presents.

1920
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:19,550
And I never thought nothing of it.

1921
01:42:20,593 --> 01:42:22,804
<i>But in the afternoons when my mom...</i>

1922
01:42:22,846 --> 01:42:24,138
<i>...was running errands...</i>

1923
01:42:24,890 --> 01:42:26,515
...he would take me to his room...

1924
01:42:26,557 --> 01:42:28,267
...and he did stuff to me.

1925
01:42:29,645 --> 01:42:31,145
<i>Did he ever abuse you?</i>

1926
01:42:33,272 --> 01:42:36,902
<i>At first, he caressed </i>
<i>me with my clothes on...</i>

1927
01:42:36,943 --> 01:42:38,654
<i>...and he made me touch him, but...</i>

1928
01:42:39,153 --> 01:42:43,491
...one afternoon, he was
drunk and he tore my clothes off.

1929
01:42:44,743 --> 01:42:45,702
And he--

1930
01:42:47,871 --> 01:42:49,706
For respect to our audience,
we'll stop there...

1931
01:42:49,748 --> 01:42:51,374
...because anybody can picture...

1932
01:42:51,415 --> 01:42:53,794
...what happened to this
innocent creature...

1933
01:42:53,835 --> 01:42:55,921
...in the hands of this degenerate here.

1934
01:42:56,170 --> 01:42:58,381
Mr. Congressman, you
requested this interview...

1935
01:42:58,422 --> 01:43:00,717
...and we very gladly agreed.

1936
01:43:00,759 --> 01:43:02,301
Don't you think it's time...

1937
01:43:02,551 --> 01:43:06,472
...you explained yourself
for this shameful act?

1938
01:43:06,514 --> 01:43:09,350
Perhaps you want to do so
to the authorities...

1939
01:43:09,392 --> 01:43:12,979
...and explain your 
connections with the mafia...

1940
01:43:13,021 --> 01:43:16,108
-...of child pornography.
-This is a false accusation!

1941
01:43:16,733 --> 01:43:18,317
Slander!

1942
01:43:19,276 --> 01:43:20,486
Let him go!

1943
01:43:20,528 --> 01:43:22,823
No!
This is slander!

1944
01:43:23,907 --> 01:43:25,533
<i>False accusations!</i>

1945
01:43:28,536 --> 01:43:29,913
<i>Of course not.</i>

1946
01:43:31,039 --> 01:43:32,124
<i>Of course not.</i>

1947
01:43:32,165 --> 01:43:33,875
<i>Delinquents with privileges...</i>

1948
01:43:34,333 --> 01:43:35,877
<i>...think they can go around...</i>

1949
01:43:35,919 --> 01:43:38,714
<i>...doing whatever they want </i>
<i>without being accountable to anyone.</i>

1950
01:43:39,463 --> 01:43:41,340
<i>That's why I insist.</i>

1951
01:43:41,382 --> 01:43:43,300
<i>No matter their color, or their party...</i>

1952
01:43:43,844 --> 01:43:46,722
<i>...they are all the same. </i>
<i>Have a good evening.</i>

1953
01:43:48,431 --> 01:43:50,349
Didn't I tell you the Messiah...

1954
01:43:50,391 --> 01:43:52,144
...was going to regret
messing around with me?

1955
01:43:54,353 --> 01:43:55,354
Attorney General...

1956
01:43:55,856 --> 01:43:58,108
...tomorrow morning tell
Congresswoman Dominguez...

1957
01:43:58,150 --> 01:44:00,234
...to start a trial
stripping him of immunity...

1958
01:44:00,443 --> 01:44:03,446
...to put that degenerate in jail.

1959
01:44:03,487 --> 01:44:04,823
<i>Sure thing, Governor.</i>

1960
01:44:04,865 --> 01:44:06,699
And you Captain,
ask my compadre for a...

1961
01:44:06,742 --> 01:44:10,036
...search warrant, let's see what
other dirt we can find on this guy.

1962
01:44:10,078 --> 01:44:11,037
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

1963
01:44:13,081 --> 01:44:15,249
...I'm tense, upset.

1964
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:19,212
Just like Perez Harris says,
fucking third rate politicians.

1965
01:44:21,505 --> 01:44:22,799
Well...

1966
01:44:22,841 --> 01:44:24,425
Enough work for today...

1967
01:44:24,885 --> 01:44:27,888
...we have guests
and we have to see to them.

1968
01:44:29,680 --> 01:44:31,850
<i>Whatever you say, Governor.</i>

1969
01:44:39,149 --> 01:44:41,567
-Cheers, sirs!
-Cheers!

1970
01:44:42,526 --> 01:44:44,154
And now...

1971
01:44:44,528 --> 01:44:46,990
...from here to the  Official Residence.

1972
01:44:47,032 --> 01:44:48,699
There he is!
Tape him!

1973
01:44:48,741 --> 01:44:50,576
<i>We are outside...</i>

1974
01:44:52,620 --> 01:44:54,538
Congressman Morales?

1975
01:44:54,580 --> 01:44:56,290
What is your opinion about
the accusation you--

1976
01:44:56,332 --> 01:44:57,918
-Is it true--
-Congressman, is it real--

1977
01:44:58,292 --> 01:45:01,087
-...about the child pornography?
-Please respond, Congressman.

1978
01:45:01,670 --> 01:45:03,840
They say you have ties
with the child...

1979
01:45:03,882 --> 01:45:06,342
-...pornography mafia.
-Congressman.

1980
01:45:06,383 --> 01:45:07,676
They are accusations--

1981
01:45:19,647 --> 01:45:21,274
Room 325.

1982
01:45:29,241 --> 01:45:30,867
Congressman Morales,
I'm very sorry...

1983
01:45:30,909 --> 01:45:32,869
...but our manager
has instructed me that you...

1984
01:45:32,911 --> 01:45:34,537
...must to leave your room
as soon as you get your things.

1985
01:45:45,257 --> 01:45:48,801
Message to the public opinion,
the President of Mexico...

1986
01:45:48,844 --> 01:45:51,054
...and all the mass media.

1987
01:45:52,013 --> 01:45:53,556
Ladies and gentlemen.

1988
01:45:55,267 --> 01:45:57,768
Today has been
the saddest day of my life.

1989
01:45:58,186 --> 01:46:01,857
<i>I know my credibility </i>
<i>after that brutal attack...</i>

1990
01:46:01,898 --> 01:46:05,110
<i>...I have suffered on </i>
<i>account of the TV station...</i>

1991
01:46:05,151 --> 01:46:06,652
<i>...has damaged my credibility.</i>

1992
01:46:07,863 --> 01:46:11,532
But maybe my case will help
end the mafias...

1993
01:46:11,574 --> 01:46:13,617
...that have robbed our country.

1994
01:46:23,544 --> 01:46:25,421
Today, our democracy is threatened...

1995
01:46:25,462 --> 01:46:28,258
...by factual powers and the monopolies...

1996
01:46:28,300 --> 01:46:30,509
...who I am accusing 
of using any strategy...

1997
01:46:30,759 --> 01:46:32,720
...to deny their acts of corruption and--

1998
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:02,959
<i>Javier, reporting that the body...</i>

1999
01:47:03,001 --> 01:47:04,835
<i>...of Congressman Agustin Morales...</i>

2000
01:47:05,211 --> 01:47:07,671
...was found in a hotel in Mexico City...

2001
01:47:07,713 --> 01:47:10,591
A suicide is suspected.

2002
01:47:10,841 --> 01:47:13,594
And this just after the 
scandal that you informed.

2003
01:47:13,636 --> 01:47:15,471
We'll have the details later.

2004
01:47:18,557 --> 01:47:19,808
Mr. Governor, as you know...

2005
01:47:19,850 --> 01:47:21,978
...people are not doing well
and the fund raising has not worked.

2006
01:47:22,228 --> 01:47:25,231
If we don't rescue the girls urgently...

2007
01:47:25,273 --> 01:47:27,233
...things can get ugly.

2008
01:47:27,275 --> 01:47:29,568
We're a few hours short of the deadline.

2009
01:47:30,028 --> 01:47:32,072
How are the investigations,
coming along, compadre?

2010
01:47:32,113 --> 01:47:33,990
Truth is, compadre, not very well.

2011
01:47:34,407 --> 01:47:36,242
We need more time.

2012
01:47:36,993 --> 01:47:40,038
-And you Commander?
-The same, sir.

2013
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:43,124
We had a witness, but...
someone killed him...

2014
01:47:43,166 --> 01:47:45,709
-...and we have no more leads.
-What do you mean someone killed him?

2015
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:47,628
You are useless!

2016
01:47:48,462 --> 01:47:50,340
We need to solve this, today.

2017
01:47:50,673 --> 01:47:52,883
And you'd better hurry up
if you don't want to end up...

2018
01:47:52,925 --> 01:47:55,594
...in a "suicide situation" like
my godson, or that Messiah asshole.

2019
01:47:55,636 --> 01:47:58,014
The thing is that the 
parents are still short...

2020
01:47:58,056 --> 01:48:00,016
-...of getting all the money.
-And what do you suggest?

2021
01:48:00,557 --> 01:48:02,185
You can see that I'm
surrounded by assholes.

2022
01:48:02,268 --> 01:48:04,561
Have you pay the million
dollars of ransom.

2023
01:48:06,189 --> 01:48:07,940
Why me, asshole?

2024
01:48:08,565 --> 01:48:10,609
Well, it's the only way
to solve the problem...

2025
01:48:10,651 --> 01:48:12,653
-...without risking your career--
-Look, Carlitos...

2026
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,740
...don't fool around with me.

2027
01:48:18,326 --> 01:48:20,453
I'm sure they have some money...

2028
01:48:20,494 --> 01:48:23,248
...between the parents
and the fund raising. Right?

2029
01:48:24,748 --> 01:48:26,959
Money is not the issue here.

2030
01:48:27,710 --> 01:48:30,422
I'll give you the whole million dollars.

2031
01:48:31,131 --> 01:48:34,009
In exchange for a favor,
that you won't be able to deny me.

2032
01:48:36,136 --> 01:48:37,761
I'm listening Governor.

2033
01:48:52,568 --> 01:48:54,611
I promise you won't be disappointed.

2034
01:48:59,825 --> 01:49:01,869
-Go get the dough, quick.
-Yes, sir.

2035
01:49:11,087 --> 01:49:15,716
POOR PEOPLE ALSO LOVE

2036
01:49:27,936 --> 01:49:29,522
<i>I've told you a thousand times, Jazmin...</i>

2037
01:49:29,563 --> 01:49:31,774
<i>...things are done my way </i>
<i>or you'll end up in the street.</i>

2038
01:49:32,691 --> 01:49:34,444
<i>I promise it won't happen </i>
<i>again, ma'am.</i>

2039
01:49:34,486 --> 01:49:36,071
<i>I'm tired of your excuses.</i>

2040
01:49:37,113 --> 01:49:40,408
<i>I don't know why my brother </i>
<i>insists on keeping you here.</i>

2041
01:49:41,451 --> 01:49:43,702
<i>You know what? </i>
<i>Pack your things and get out.</i>

2042
01:49:44,329 --> 01:49:46,705
<i>No. </i>
<i>No, no, no.</i>

2043
01:49:46,997 --> 01:49:48,624
<i>My mother is very sick ma'am...</i>

2044
01:49:48,665 --> 01:49:51,252
<i>-...you can't leave me without a job. </i>
<i>-You're going to the street.</i>

2045
01:49:52,378 --> 01:49:54,214
<i>We add 2000...</i>

2046
01:49:54,255 --> 01:49:56,757
280 thousand...
No!

2047
01:49:56,799 --> 01:49:59,177
-It wasn't 200, it was 28 thousand.
-OK.

2048
01:49:59,219 --> 01:50:00,220
One hundred...

2049
01:50:00,844 --> 01:50:02,638
And 300...

2050
01:50:05,766 --> 01:50:08,602
...and then we have the hundred from--

2051
01:50:08,644 --> 01:50:10,355
If there is any money left, will I get it?

2052
01:50:10,646 --> 01:50:12,440
Chava if there is any left
it will go directly to...

2053
01:50:12,482 --> 01:50:13,732
...the "Yes we can" Foundation.

2054
01:50:14,983 --> 01:50:16,652
Do you think we're going to steal it?

2055
01:50:16,693 --> 01:50:19,531
No, no, of course not,
but I'm in such deep debt...

2056
01:50:19,572 --> 01:50:21,199
-...I thought--
-Stop thinking. Leave it.

2057
01:50:21,241 --> 01:50:22,492
-Sorry.
-Salvador...

2058
01:50:22,534 --> 01:50:23,784
...how dare you say
something like that.

2059
01:50:24,034 --> 01:50:25,537
Well, I'm sorry if
you misunderstood me.

2060
01:50:26,538 --> 01:50:28,622
Ok. Let's go.
Let's go!

2061
01:50:30,958 --> 01:50:32,293
Pick up, Chava.

2062
01:50:34,254 --> 01:50:35,045
Hello.

2063
01:50:35,087 --> 01:50:36,589
<i>What's going on you son of a bitch!</i>

2064
01:50:36,880 --> 01:50:39,425
<i>I heard on TV that you have the dough...</i>

2065
01:50:39,467 --> 01:50:40,301
<i>...don't you asshole?</i>

2066
01:50:41,177 --> 01:50:42,970
<i>Yes, where do you want me to take it.</i>

2067
01:50:43,011 --> 01:50:45,557
<i>Not so fast asshole  </i>
<i>if you think I'm going...</i>

2068
01:50:45,598 --> 01:50:48,393
<i>...to settle for the original, </i>
<i>amount, you must be stupid.</i>

2069
01:50:48,934 --> 01:50:51,354
<i>Now I want two million dollars.</i>

2070
01:50:52,230 --> 01:50:54,315
I swear on my daughters
I don't have anymore sir...

2071
01:50:54,357 --> 01:50:56,650
...I only have a million,
it's what they gave me.

2072
01:50:56,692 --> 01:50:58,361
<i>Ok, fucker.</i>

2073
01:50:58,611 --> 01:51:01,822
<i>You know the iron mine </i>
<i>next to the train station?</i>

2074
01:51:01,864 --> 01:51:02,990
Perfectly.

2075
01:51:03,491 --> 01:51:05,201
<i>Get there right now.</i>

2076
01:51:05,618 --> 01:51:07,953
<i>Take your phone and wait for my call.</i>

2077
01:51:08,329 --> 01:51:11,624
<i>But I'm warning you you son of a bitch...</i>

2078
01:51:12,250 --> 01:51:15,002
<i>...if you do anything stupid </i>
<i>like bringing the cops...</i>

2079
01:51:15,043 --> 01:51:15,961
<i>...or anything like that...</i>

2080
01:51:16,462 --> 01:51:18,922
<i>...you can say goodbye to </i>
<i>your fucking daughters.</i>

2081
01:51:19,424 --> 01:51:20,425
<i>Is that clear, asshole?</i>

2082
01:51:21,176 --> 01:51:22,968
I'm on my way.

2083
01:51:27,097 --> 01:51:30,185
-I have to leave, hurry up.
-Chava, as soon as you know...

2084
01:51:30,226 --> 01:51:32,395
...where the girls are
let us know so we can go and shoot.

2085
01:51:32,437 --> 01:51:34,564
Blessed Virgin Mary is protecting you.

2086
01:51:34,606 --> 01:51:36,357
-It will be fine.
-Yes.

2087
01:51:36,399 --> 01:51:38,318
Bring back my daughters,
bring back my daughters...

2088
01:51:38,359 --> 01:51:40,320
I'm leaving!
I've got to leave now!

2089
01:51:42,572 --> 01:51:44,282
<i>Our Father Who art in Heaven...</i>

2090
01:51:44,324 --> 01:51:45,782
<i>...hallowed be Thy name.</i>

2091
01:51:46,492 --> 01:51:49,953
<i>Thy Kingdom come, </i>
<i>Thy will be done...</i>

2092
01:51:51,121 --> 01:51:52,956
.<i>..on Earth as it is in Heaven...</i>

2093
01:52:06,178 --> 01:52:08,722
We are in town...

2094
01:52:08,764 --> 01:52:10,974
...the headlamps in the distance...

2095
01:52:11,016 --> 01:52:13,977
...are Mr. Garza's the father of the twins.

2096
01:52:14,019 --> 01:52:17,147
He is now heading there
to hand over the ransom...

2097
01:52:17,189 --> 01:52:19,149
...demanded by the kidnappers.

2098
01:52:19,733 --> 01:52:22,152
We know our lives are in danger...

2099
01:52:22,194 --> 01:52:24,863
...but our commitment
is to inform you at all times.

2100
01:52:25,323 --> 01:52:26,449
<i>More drama!</i>

2101
01:52:26,491 --> 01:52:29,034
It looks like we are getting close.

2102
01:52:29,743 --> 01:52:32,996
There is tension and 
nervousness in the air...

2103
01:52:33,038 --> 01:52:35,832
...but nothing will stop us from
delivering to your home...

2104
01:52:36,124 --> 01:52:37,834
...this important event.

2105
01:52:38,085 --> 01:52:39,379
It's okay.

2106
01:53:29,177 --> 01:53:30,178
Come, let's get up.

2107
01:53:32,055 --> 01:53:34,392
Wait, wait!

2108
01:53:34,434 --> 01:53:36,893
It's very dangerous, we don't
know what's up there.

2109
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:38,521
Ricardo, imagine the rating this...

2110
01:53:38,563 --> 01:53:40,105
...will give us, don't be a pussy.

2111
01:53:45,528 --> 01:53:46,529
What about the girls?

2112
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:51,158
-Where are my daughters?
-Just wait, asshole.

2113
01:53:52,117 --> 01:53:54,995
-Where are my--?
-Enough with your daughters.

2114
01:53:56,872 --> 01:53:59,875
-Where are my daughters?
-Enough you little cunt!

2115
01:53:59,916 --> 01:54:01,669
Shut the fuck up!

2116
01:54:06,507 --> 01:54:08,133
I'll go no further.

2117
01:54:08,509 --> 01:54:10,470
Carlos, I'm an asset for the Network...

2118
01:54:10,511 --> 01:54:12,388
...if something happens to me,
are you going to be responsible?

2119
01:54:13,598 --> 01:54:15,433
Just start rolling.

2120
01:54:17,184 --> 01:54:20,187
The tension is indescribable...

2121
01:54:20,646 --> 01:54:22,357
...we can see how Mr. Garza...

2122
01:54:22,398 --> 01:54:23,940
...has the briefcase with the ransom...

2123
01:54:24,274 --> 01:54:26,819
...and is in front of the kidnapper...

2124
01:54:27,027 --> 01:54:31,031
-...we can tell he's armed...
-Ricardo stop it!

2125
01:54:31,699 --> 01:54:34,660
You are saying exactly what
we can see, I'll edit it.

2126
01:54:36,912 --> 01:54:40,458
-It better be all here.
-I swear to God.

2127
01:54:42,876 --> 01:54:45,671
Son of a bitch!

2128
01:54:46,046 --> 01:54:47,923
I told you to come alone.

2129
01:54:48,298 --> 01:54:50,802
Now you're fucked!

2130
01:55:11,029 --> 01:55:13,365
Come on, Ricardo you can get up!

2131
01:55:14,157 --> 01:55:16,411
-Did he kill him?
-He fainted.

2132
01:55:16,452 --> 01:55:19,037
I thought you were used to this,
Hussein, Gadhafi...

2133
01:55:19,079 --> 01:55:21,541
-...and all that shit.
-No, it's not the same.

2134
01:55:21,582 --> 01:55:23,917
They respect the press over there,
not like here.

2135
01:55:24,752 --> 01:55:26,838
Toño, check the material
see if anything works...

2136
01:55:26,879 --> 01:55:27,880
...tell Ramon to pull the van up...

2137
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:29,549
...I'll check on Mr. Garza.

2138
01:56:16,554 --> 01:56:18,806
Motherfuckers!

2139
01:56:18,848 --> 01:56:20,808
You fucking junkies.

2140
01:56:22,142 --> 01:56:23,644
Doña Chole?

2141
01:56:29,316 --> 01:56:30,735
Doña Chole!

2142
01:56:32,570 --> 01:56:35,615
Fucking cunt!

2143
01:57:25,080 --> 01:57:28,543
You should have seen me Juanita,
I was the only one with...

2144
01:57:28,584 --> 01:57:31,378
...a cool head I almost had
to finish the story on my own.

2145
01:57:31,419 --> 01:57:34,297
If I hadn't reacted like I did
I would have gotten shot.

2146
01:58:10,793 --> 01:58:13,545
-Bless the Lord!
-Ricardo, the microphone.

2147
01:58:13,588 --> 01:58:15,631
-Mom!
-Honey!

2148
01:58:15,673 --> 01:58:16,757
Honey!

2149
01:58:17,507 --> 01:58:18,926
Come, come!

2150
01:58:18,968 --> 01:58:19,802
Get in there!

2151
01:58:19,844 --> 01:58:21,846
Zoom in!
Get it.

2152
01:58:21,887 --> 01:58:23,931
We are in the Garza home...

2153
01:58:23,973 --> 01:58:25,557
...where we are living
a truly historic moment.

2154
01:58:25,600 --> 01:58:28,476
-Lucia, Salvador, what are your--
-Leave us alone, leave...

2155
01:58:28,518 --> 01:58:30,520
-Salvador, what does it feel--?
-Get out of my way!

2156
01:58:30,562 --> 01:58:33,315
-Are you OK, honey?
-Just two minutes...

2157
01:58:34,025 --> 01:58:36,819
-Lucia, Lucia...
-Leave us alone!

2158
01:58:37,110 --> 01:58:37,945
Get out!

2159
01:58:38,361 --> 01:58:39,195
But--

2160
01:58:39,404 --> 01:58:40,656
Just--

2161
01:58:42,240 --> 01:58:43,659
Please, open the door.

2162
01:58:44,284 --> 01:58:46,578
I remind you that you have a contract!

2163
01:58:47,872 --> 01:58:49,749
<i>-Bless the Lord! </i>
<i>-Ricardo, the microphone.</i>

2164
01:58:49,790 --> 01:58:51,751
<i>-Mom! </i>
<i>-How are you?</i>

2165
01:58:51,792 --> 01:58:53,794
<i>-Mom! </i>
<i>-How are you honey?</i>

2166
01:58:53,836 --> 01:58:54,754
<i>Is it rolling?</i>

2167
01:58:55,046 --> 01:58:56,129
<i>Mom!</i>

2168
01:58:57,840 --> 01:58:59,967
<i>We are in the Garza home...</i>

2169
01:59:00,009 --> 01:59:02,260
<i>...with a historic moment, </i>
<i>Lucia, what are your...</i>

2170
01:59:02,302 --> 01:59:03,511
<i>-...thoughts right now? </i>
<i>-Leave us!</i>

2171
01:59:03,553 --> 01:59:05,056
<i>-Salvador-- </i>
<i>-Get out of here--</i>

2172
01:59:05,097 --> 01:59:07,642
<i>-Are you OK, honey? </i>
<i>-Just two minutes...</i>

2173
01:59:08,433 --> 01:59:09,517
<i>Lucia!</i>

2174
01:59:09,559 --> 01:59:11,478
<i>-Please! </i>
<i>-Get out!</i>

2175
01:59:12,312 --> 01:59:14,272
<i>I remind you that you have a contract!</i>

2176
01:59:14,314 --> 01:59:16,859
Fuck me, this is shit.

2177
01:59:17,400 --> 01:59:19,611
I'm truly sorry, Don Carlos.

2178
01:59:19,945 --> 01:59:22,405
You know better than I do...

2179
01:59:22,447 --> 01:59:24,574
...you can imagine how it
would affect the Governor...

2180
01:59:24,616 --> 01:59:27,285
-...if we arrest the parents.
-They would kill us.

2181
01:59:27,327 --> 01:59:29,747
I don't give a shit, those fuckers
signed an exclusivity...

2182
01:59:29,789 --> 01:59:31,791
...contract, I gave them a million dollars--

2183
01:59:32,124 --> 01:59:34,001
If you want you can sue them...

2184
01:59:34,043 --> 01:59:35,961
...although I don't think that would help.

2185
01:59:36,336 --> 01:59:38,421
I don't think you can get your money back.

2186
01:59:38,673 --> 01:59:40,340
No, I should sue you...

2187
01:59:40,382 --> 01:59:42,342
...didn't I tell you to keep me informed?

2188
01:59:42,384 --> 01:59:44,636
Yes, Don Carlos,
but as I said, my boys...

2189
01:59:44,679 --> 01:59:46,764
...got an anonymous call
and they told them...

2190
01:59:46,806 --> 01:59:48,808
...where the girls were,
they didn't even tell me.

2191
01:59:48,849 --> 01:59:51,518
The officers found them
in an abandoned park...

2192
01:59:51,559 --> 01:59:53,436
...and they took them to
the Headquarters.

2193
01:59:53,478 --> 01:59:55,898
They called us and
with that information...

2194
01:59:55,940 --> 01:59:59,026
...we found the place
were they had them.

2195
01:59:59,068 --> 02:00:00,695
Just my luck!
One week...

2196
02:00:00,736 --> 02:00:02,947
...of sky high ratings
and we have no closure.

2197
02:00:02,988 --> 02:00:04,656
So, Carlos what do we do next?

2198
02:00:06,324 --> 02:00:07,993
Well, partner...

2199
02:00:08,035 --> 02:00:10,245
...the screenwriter
really fucked up this time...

2200
02:00:10,286 --> 02:00:12,748
-...let's see how we fare in Mexico City.
-What did you say?

2201
02:00:13,581 --> 02:00:15,918
That basically, we're fucked.

2202
02:00:15,960 --> 02:00:17,627
No, no, no, after that.
What did you say?

2203
02:00:17,669 --> 02:00:19,714
That the screenwriter screwed up.

2204
02:00:20,172 --> 02:00:23,759
No, no, there is still
something we can do.

2205
02:00:23,801 --> 02:00:25,720
This is not over until its over.

2206
02:00:29,056 --> 02:00:30,640
24 HOURS 30 MINUTES

2207
02:00:31,474 --> 02:00:33,393
SPECIAL REPORT

2208
02:00:35,562 --> 02:00:37,815
Javier, we are in the place know as...

2209
02:00:37,857 --> 02:00:39,315
..."San Juan, El Bajo".

2210
02:00:39,357 --> 02:00:41,443
In front of us inside the ranch...

2211
02:00:41,484 --> 02:00:44,113
...the Garza twins are being held captive.

2212
02:00:44,155 --> 02:00:47,032
We have been invited
by the state authorities...

2213
02:00:47,074 --> 02:00:49,367
...to witness for the first time in...

2214
02:00:49,409 --> 02:00:55,290
...Mexican television,
a live rescue operation.

2215
02:00:56,834 --> 02:00:59,044
We are slowly closing in to show you...

2216
02:00:59,086 --> 02:01:01,797
...in detail the work of
these anonymous heroes...

2217
02:01:01,839 --> 02:01:03,506
...who risk their lives for our safety.

2218
02:01:05,633 --> 02:01:08,553
We are in position.
And we are moving.

2219
02:01:08,595 --> 02:01:09,847
Go, go!

2220
02:01:09,889 --> 02:01:11,473
Go, go!

2221
02:01:11,514 --> 02:01:13,225
Go, go!

2222
02:01:13,600 --> 02:01:15,186
It is probable...

2223
02:01:15,227 --> 02:01:18,022
...the kidnappers
got wind of this operation...

2224
02:01:18,063 --> 02:01:19,731
...and opened fire.

2225
02:01:25,445 --> 02:01:28,740
Authorities, counterattack...

2226
02:01:28,783 --> 02:01:31,035
...and bravely move on.

2227
02:01:31,827 --> 02:01:34,412
There is cross fire, something here...

2228
02:01:34,454 --> 02:01:35,998
...reminds me of images transmitted...

2229
02:01:36,040 --> 02:01:37,749
...from the Middle East,
a couple of months ago...

2230
02:01:37,792 --> 02:01:39,960
...but unlike war...

2231
02:01:40,002 --> 02:01:43,088
...the sentimental factor
of the girls' wellbeing...

2232
02:01:43,338 --> 02:01:46,299
...is an additional worry
that keeps us vigilant.

2233
02:01:50,595 --> 02:01:53,473
The intensity of the shootings
inside the house...

2234
02:01:53,515 --> 02:01:56,518
...is increasing
something is happening in there.

2235
02:01:57,019 --> 02:01:58,854
But our commitment to inform you...

2236
02:01:58,896 --> 02:02:01,564
...is what matters most,
so we are moving on.

2237
02:02:01,606 --> 02:02:02,440
Come on!

2238
02:02:03,108 --> 02:02:04,317
Let's go!

2239
02:02:15,495 --> 02:02:17,789
Viewer discretion is advised...

2240
02:02:17,832 --> 02:02:19,541
...given the nature of the images...

2241
02:02:19,582 --> 02:02:20,750
...we are about to show.

2242
02:02:21,334 --> 02:02:23,419
We found the bodies
of the kidnappers...

2243
02:02:23,670 --> 02:02:26,006
...who lost their lives
by not surrendering...

2244
02:02:26,048 --> 02:02:27,549
...to the police.

2245
02:02:28,633 --> 02:02:31,594
But apparently
kidnapping wasn't the only...

2246
02:02:31,636 --> 02:02:34,139
...illicit activity of these thugs.

2247
02:02:34,181 --> 02:02:37,852
We can see to my right
the big arsenal in their possession.

2248
02:02:37,893 --> 02:02:40,312
And the enormous amount of drugs.

2249
02:02:40,353 --> 02:02:43,858
Surely, the backbone
of their activities.

2250
02:02:46,193 --> 02:02:48,863
Now we need to know what happened...

2251
02:02:48,904 --> 02:02:50,072
...with the twins.

2252
02:02:50,363 --> 02:02:52,867
Let's pray to God
they are safe and sound...

2253
02:02:52,908 --> 02:02:55,202
...and that they haven't fallen to these...

2254
02:02:55,244 --> 02:02:57,872
-...terrible delinquents.
-Here they are, cover me!

2255
02:02:59,206 --> 02:03:02,750
Now, now,
We'll get you out soon.

2256
02:03:03,376 --> 02:03:05,461
You're OK, you're OK.

2257
02:03:05,503 --> 02:03:07,006
It's OK, girls.

2258
02:03:08,548 --> 02:03:11,176
Come here.
Come here!

2259
02:03:11,218 --> 02:03:13,262
It's OK. Careful.

2260
02:03:13,304 --> 02:03:15,722
It's hard to find the right words...

2261
02:03:15,763 --> 02:03:18,516
...to express what we are feeling...

2262
02:03:18,558 --> 02:03:20,476
...and describe this moment.

2263
02:03:20,727 --> 02:03:22,770
Apparently, and thank God the girls...

2264
02:03:22,812 --> 02:03:25,398
...are fine, although time will tell...

2265
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:27,359
...if they won't be scarred
by this terrible event...

2266
02:03:27,400 --> 02:03:29,069
...in the future.

2267
02:03:29,694 --> 02:03:32,780
But for now, thanks
to the brave men...

2268
02:03:32,822 --> 02:03:35,034
...in the State's Security Corps...

2269
02:03:35,075 --> 02:03:37,577
...and to Governor Vargas' determination...

2270
02:03:38,078 --> 02:03:40,956
...apparently our story
has a happy ending.

2271
02:03:49,924 --> 02:03:50,840
Ana...

2272
02:03:50,882 --> 02:03:53,093
Elena... come here.

2273
02:03:53,344 --> 02:03:54,636
-Mom!
-Mom!

2274
02:03:54,677 --> 02:03:57,056
And in one of
the most moving scenes...

2275
02:03:57,097 --> 02:04:00,184
...I've had to describe,
Lucia and Salvador Garza...

2276
02:04:00,433 --> 02:04:02,852
...have finally been
reunited with their daughters...

2277
02:04:02,894 --> 02:04:05,813
<i>...who they hugged </i>
<i>and kissed full of emotion.</i>

2278
02:04:10,027 --> 02:04:12,904
<i>Governor Vargas presented </i>
<i>the twins next...</i>

2279
02:04:12,947 --> 02:04:14,906
<i>...to their parents </i>
<i>and gave a brief message...</i>

2280
02:04:14,949 --> 02:04:17,450
<i>...to his citizens, let's hear it.</i>

2281
02:04:18,743 --> 02:04:23,374
Dear friends, thank you
for being here...

2282
02:04:24,582 --> 02:04:28,295
...today is a day of
great happiness for all.

2283
02:04:30,255 --> 02:04:34,259
Today we have proven
that with willpower...

2284
02:04:34,301 --> 02:04:35,970
...hard work and sensitivity...

2285
02:04:36,428 --> 02:04:39,264
...we can change
the situation in our country.

2286
02:04:40,556 --> 02:04:43,518
Everybody knows the problems...

2287
02:04:43,559 --> 02:04:47,689
<i>...and challenges our Nation </i>
<i>is going through.</i>

2288
02:04:47,730 --> 02:04:50,483
Santiago, focus on the Governor's face.

2289
02:04:50,692 --> 02:04:54,113
When we act firmly and decisively...

2290
02:04:54,154 --> 02:04:56,823
...there are no obstacles
that can't be overcome.

2291
02:04:57,740 --> 02:05:01,370
A few days ago
nobody imagined that the Garza...

2292
02:05:01,412 --> 02:05:04,706
...family story,
would have a happy ending.

2293
02:05:05,416 --> 02:05:10,586
But I gave my word
and made a promise to all of you...

2294
02:05:10,628 --> 02:05:14,425
...and today I can proudly
assure you, that if you continue...

2295
02:05:14,924 --> 02:05:17,719
...to give me your support,
working closely together...

2296
02:05:18,303 --> 02:05:20,680
...in a not so distant future...

2297
02:05:20,722 --> 02:05:23,850
...our Mexico can change.

2298
02:05:27,146 --> 02:05:28,313
<i>Thank you!</i>

02:06:04,557 --> 02:06:06,477
<i>...Ricardo Diaz.</i>

2314
02:06:06,934 --> 02:06:08,603
Thank you, Ricardo.

2315
02:06:08,644 --> 02:06:11,356
Congratulations to you
and the whole production...

2316
02:06:11,398 --> 02:06:14,276
...team for this
extraordinary story...

2317
02:06:14,318 --> 02:06:16,445
...that kept us at the edge of our seats...

2318
02:06:16,694 --> 02:06:19,947
...and that thank God,
had a happy ending.

2319
02:06:20,407 --> 02:06:23,826
And in other not so happy news,
coming back to reality...

2320
02:06:23,868 --> 02:06:26,996
...today a new set of
economic measures was announced...

2321
02:06:27,038 --> 02:06:30,375
...to alleviate the grave financial
situation in the country.

2322
02:06:30,417 --> 02:06:32,001
The Secretary of Finance
announced...

2323
02:06:32,043 --> 02:06:34,088
...that starting tomorrow
the basic food basket...

2324
02:06:34,505 --> 02:06:37,924
...products, including milk, bread...

2325
02:06:37,965 --> 02:06:41,178
...tortillas, transportation and fuels...

2326
02:06:41,220 --> 02:06:44,473
...will rise from 25 to 30%

2327
02:06:44,889 --> 02:06:48,017
This news triggered
nervousness in the markets...

2328
02:06:48,059 --> 02:06:51,062
...and the dollar went
up to a record high...

2329
02:06:51,105 --> 02:06:54,191
...and the stock market
dropped to its worst low in six years.

2330
02:06:54,649 --> 02:06:57,777
To give us the details
that these measures will have...

2331
02:06:57,819 --> 02:07:00,405
...we are going live...

2332
02:07:00,447 --> 02:07:02,241
...to the Official Residence...

2333
02:07:02,282 --> 02:07:03,991
...and the President of the Republic.

2334
02:07:04,243 --> 02:07:05,993
Good evening Mr. President.

2335
02:07:06,619 --> 02:07:10,039
<i>Good evening Javier, I'm pleased </i>
<i>to be in your show again.</i>

2336
02:07:10,499 --> 02:07:12,041
Mr. President...

2337
02:07:12,083 --> 02:07:15,462
...today new economic measures
were announced...

2338
02:07:15,504 --> 02:07:19,299
...how do you think these severe
adjustments will impact...

2339
02:07:19,341 --> 02:07:20,883
...Mexican families?

2340
02:07:21,301 --> 02:07:24,929
<i>Look Javier, I know the measures </i>
<i>announced yesterday...</i>

2341
02:07:24,971 --> 02:07:26,681
<i>...by the Secretary of Finance...</i>

2342
02:07:27,014 --> 02:07:30,477
<i>...are painful, but necessary.</i>

2343
02:07:30,519 --> 02:07:32,979
<i>What do I mean by this, Javier?</i>

2344
02:07:33,020 --> 02:07:36,441
This economic package is, necessary...

2345
02:07:36,483 --> 02:07:38,943
...to maintain fiscal balance.

2346
02:07:38,985 --> 02:07:41,488
On your specific question, Javier...

2347
02:07:41,530 --> 02:07:43,948
...if it will impact Mexican families...

2348
02:07:43,990 --> 02:07:45,700
...you'll understand that right now...

2349
02:07:45,741 --> 02:07:47,702
...I can't answer that, because...

2350
02:07:47,994 --> 02:07:50,121
<i>...I'm not the lady of the house.</i>

2351
02:07:50,913 --> 02:07:53,292
Excuse me, Mr. President,
what was that?

2352
02:07:53,417 --> 02:07:55,835
-The lady of the house?
-That's right, Javier.

2353
02:07:57,003 --> 02:07:59,797
I can't know the impact these...

2354
02:07:59,922 --> 02:08:01,924
...economic measures will
have on Mexican families...

2355
02:08:02,217 --> 02:08:05,720
...because as you can imagine
with all my responsibilities...

2356
02:08:06,305 --> 02:08:08,973
...I haven't, been able...

2357
02:08:09,015 --> 02:08:10,683
...to go shopping or to the market.

2358
02:08:15,021 --> 02:08:16,190
Good night, Javier.

2359
02:08:18,691 --> 02:08:21,486
TECHNICAL FAILURE
SORRY FOR THE INCONVENIENCE

2360
02:08:53,518 --> 02:08:54,353
What is it?

2361
02:08:54,436 --> 02:08:55,687
You should come with us.

2362
02:08:55,728 --> 02:08:56,688
Where...?

2363
02:08:57,648 --> 02:08:58,649
Let me go!

2364
02:09:09,576 --> 02:09:12,954
OFFICIAL RESIDENCE

2365
02:09:46,195 --> 02:09:48,155
Good night General,
we were waiting for you.

2366
02:09:48,197 --> 02:09:49,366
Please come in.

2367
02:09:59,208 --> 02:10:01,085
Let me open the door for you.

2368
02:10:13,765 --> 02:10:16,183
Good evening General,
he is waiting for you.

2369
02:10:36,496 --> 02:10:38,956
-Good evening, General.
-Good evening, Don Carlos.

2370
02:10:39,374 --> 02:10:41,752
-Congratulations on your appointment.
-Have a seat.

2371
02:10:44,504 --> 02:10:46,715
Here is the money,
if you want to count it.

2372
02:10:46,798 --> 02:10:48,215
No, that's not necessary General.

2373
02:10:48,508 --> 02:10:50,802
This is from the Office
of the President.

2374
02:11:01,813 --> 02:11:03,607
Is the country really this bad, General?

2375
02:11:04,023 --> 02:11:05,692
Let me send this right down, we are about...

2376
02:11:05,734 --> 02:11:07,361
-...to go on live.
-No problem.

2377
02:11:11,864 --> 02:11:14,283
If that is all, Don Carlos...

2378
02:11:14,618 --> 02:11:16,620
-...I'll be excused.
-Thank you, General.

2379
02:11:16,994 --> 02:11:19,790
As always, a pleasure
working with you.

2380
02:11:19,831 --> 02:11:20,665
Likewise.

2381
02:11:24,126 --> 02:11:25,294
General.

2382
02:11:25,336 --> 02:11:26,797
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

2383
02:11:30,341 --> 02:11:32,343
-What's up, Carlitos?
-What's up, chief?

2384
02:11:33,344 --> 02:11:35,096
-It's all here.
-All of it.

2385
02:11:35,137 --> 02:11:36,931
Look what they sent
from the Official Residence.

2386
02:11:38,015 --> 02:11:39,518
I already sent it to the news.

2387
02:11:41,185 --> 02:11:42,646
You're kidding!

2388
02:11:43,354 --> 02:11:45,482
They had to resort to this?

2389
02:11:46,817 --> 02:11:49,026
This is the first symptom
that just like in the old days...

2390
02:11:49,068 --> 02:11:50,862
...this country is fucked up.

2391
02:11:56,117 --> 02:11:57,159
It's time.

2392
02:12:16,137 --> 02:12:17,972
Good evening.

2393
02:12:18,013 --> 02:12:21,601
This is 24 hours in 30 minutes,
I'm Ricardo Diaz...

2394
02:12:21,643 --> 02:12:23,854
...and these are the headlines.

2395
02:12:26,272 --> 02:12:28,941
The President announced the visit...

2396
02:12:28,983 --> 02:12:31,695
...of Pope Francis I to our country.

2397
02:12:32,194 --> 02:12:35,156
His Holiness will arrive
in Mexico at the end of August...

2398
02:12:35,197 --> 02:12:37,868
...and will tour several states...

2399
02:12:37,909 --> 02:12:40,579
...to call for peace
and harmony amongst Mexicans.

2400
02:12:41,120 --> 02:12:43,998
We have all the details exclusively...

2401
02:12:44,039 --> 02:12:45,917
...with our correspondent in the Vatican.

2402
02:12:46,543 --> 02:12:50,129
Extreme weather events
are taking a toll...

2403
02:12:50,171 --> 02:12:52,799
...in Tabasco, Chiapas
and Veracruz the floods...

2404
02:12:52,841 --> 02:12:56,678
...have left more than 600
dead and dozens missing.

2405
02:12:57,679 --> 02:13:00,055
Violence is unstoppable...

2406
02:13:00,097 --> 02:13:03,685
...there were shoot outs 
today in three states...

2407
02:13:03,727 --> 02:13:06,688
...with 64 casualties.

2408
02:13:07,188 --> 02:13:09,982
In international news protest continue...

2409
02:13:10,024 --> 02:13:12,486
...in Europe due to 
adjustments decreed by...

2410
02:13:12,527 --> 02:13:14,863
...the International Monetary Fund.

2411
02:13:14,905 --> 02:13:17,782
In finance, the Secretary
of Finance announced...

2412
02:13:17,824 --> 02:13:19,659
...a new bank rescue plan...

2413
02:13:19,701 --> 02:13:21,661
...and the peso and stock market suffered...

2414
02:13:21,703 --> 02:13:23,705
...strategic negative adjustments.

2415
02:13:24,288 --> 02:13:27,249
In sports, all the goals
from today's matches...

2416
02:13:27,291 --> 02:13:28,334
...and more.

2417
02:13:29,794 --> 02:13:32,589
This is 24 hours in 30 minutes...

2418
02:13:32,631 --> 02:13:34,966
...up next the detailed information...

2419
02:13:35,007 --> 02:13:36,801
...but before a brief message from...

2420
02:13:36,843 --> 02:13:38,260
...our sponsors.

2421
02:13:45,184 --> 02:13:46,978
OUR DIFFERENCES DIVIDE US

02:13:48,020 --> 02:13:49,313
BRINGING MEXICO TOGETHER

2424
02:13:49,773 --> 02:13:52,651
This country needs a real leader...

2425
02:13:53,150 --> 02:13:55,737
...a man that can keep his promises...

2426
02:13:55,779 --> 02:13:58,865
...who is not afraid to face adversity.

2427
02:13:59,741 --> 02:14:01,116
I'm Carmelo Vargas...

2428
02:14:01,450 --> 02:14:05,454
...with your help, I'll become
the next President of the Republic.

2429
02:14:07,707 --> 02:14:09,626
Together, we will achieve it.

2430
02:14:15,297 --> 02:14:17,466
COALITION UNITED FOR MEXICO

2431
02:14:17,842 --> 02:14:20,135
Thank you for tuning in...

2432
02:14:20,177 --> 02:14:23,472
...tonight we have
some very special guests...

2433
02:14:23,514 --> 02:14:25,224
...and I want to welcome them.

2434
02:14:25,266 --> 02:14:28,979
Lucia, Salvador, Ana and Elena,
it's good to have you here.

2435
02:14:29,020 --> 02:14:30,939
Thank you, Ricardo for the invitation.

2436
02:14:30,981 --> 02:14:33,984
Salvador, how do you feel
after all you've lived through?

2437
02:14:34,275 --> 02:14:37,152
First of all, thank you
for the opportunity, Ricardo.

2438
02:14:37,194 --> 02:14:40,155
I have to admit that
my girls' kidnapping...

2439
02:14:40,197 --> 02:14:41,950
...has been one of the hardest and...

2440
02:14:41,992 --> 02:14:44,035
...most painful experiences in my life.

2441
02:14:44,285 --> 02:14:46,955
What I can assure you
is that in spite of it all...

2442
02:14:46,997 --> 02:14:49,583
...having the support
of your TV Network...

2443
02:14:49,624 --> 02:14:52,376
...and the commitment
and support of candidate...

2444
02:14:52,418 --> 02:14:55,672
...Carmelo Vargas, have allowed
me to recover the faith...

2445
02:14:55,714 --> 02:14:57,841
...and trust in the future of this country.

2446
02:14:58,090 --> 02:15:00,134
Thank you for your statement,
Salvador.

2447
02:15:00,384 --> 02:15:02,511
But you're not here to
talk about the kidnapping...

2448
02:15:02,553 --> 02:15:05,097
...are you, Lucia?
You want to share some...

2449
02:15:05,139 --> 02:15:07,767
-...important news.
-That's right, Ricardo.

2450
02:15:08,100 --> 02:15:11,186
We want to announce to your viewers...

2451
02:15:11,228 --> 02:15:13,355
...that our daughters, Ana and Elena...

2452
02:15:13,732 --> 02:15:16,233
...will have the leading roles
in a soap opera...

2453
02:15:16,275 --> 02:15:18,069
...called "World of Joy"...

2454
02:15:18,444 --> 02:15:20,864
...that will air very soon...

2455
02:15:20,905 --> 02:15:23,157
...in prime time on your TV Network.

2456
02:15:23,198 --> 02:15:26,118
That is great news!
I'm sure it will be a success.

2457
02:15:26,160 --> 02:15:27,954
Do you mind if before we go...

2458
02:15:27,996 --> 02:15:29,706
...our future stars give us a small token...

2459
02:15:29,748 --> 02:15:32,291
-...of their talent?
-Of course.

2460
02:16:20,006 --> 02:16:24,010
