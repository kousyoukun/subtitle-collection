1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,230
you were the son
of one of the richest merchants.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:10,070
Though she pretended to be angry,
it was only

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:17,170
to convince you she was not
at all impressed by wealth.

4
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,050
Believe me.

5
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:24,380
You are young, reasonable and handsome,

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,820
but remember gold is never
an obstacle to love.

7
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,200
How shall we spend the afternoon?

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:44,370
I want to see the town...
alone!

9
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,380
You see there was no way out
of this situation.

10
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:51,250
Go and say prayers, then!

11
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,400
It was a locket from my brother.

12
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:26,300
Don't ask about anything else,

13
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,550
unless you find something else
belonging to me.

14
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,020
Then you'll be able to demand a reward.

15
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,700
We shouldn't be seen together.

16
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:54,530
Lopez Suarez to...

17
00:01:54,610 --> 00:01:56,080
What?

18
00:01:58,550 --> 00:02:00,110
To Inez.

19
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,790
There is charm in my eyes, comma

20
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:13,230
and you, lady, are the only reason for it.

21
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:24,580
I would like to put
my thoughts in this letter,

22
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,880
but they seem...

23
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,920
they seem to vanish.

24
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,820
Don Roque, give it back!

25
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:12,190
Where?

26
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:21,530
Don Roque!

27
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:22,900
Don Lopez!

28
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:29,830
Stop, wait!

29
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:54,120
Well, a letter has to be delivered.

30
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:57,830
You should be grateful to me, señor.

31
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:17,420
Señora.

32
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,660
Why did you use a man

33
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:25,490
whose impertinence I already disliked,

34
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,530
to bring me your letter?

35
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,700
I wrote that letter for my own pleasure,
and that imp stole it.

36
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,670
Ever since I got to Madrid,

37
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:40,710
he has haunted me like an evil spirit.

38
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,180
I don't think I can be bothered
with this nonsense.

39
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:55,020
And what would you like to know now, señor?

40
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,320
Señora, I wish I knew who you
were and what your name is.

41
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:03,330
The daughter of a man
who is as rich as your father,

42
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,630
the banker, Moro.

43
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:10,070
The curse of my life.

44
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:15,840
I cannot think of you under
the threat of my father's curse.

45
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,710
He crossed many seas to set up
as a merchant in Cádiz.

46
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,220
In Cádiz.

47
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,520
Don't believe him and don't lose heart.

48
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:25,290
Those little heirs are hard to get hooked,

49
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,720
but sooner or later, their turn will come.

50
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:33,920
You'll scare my dog, meddler!

51
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,330
Now only death is left for me.

52
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,660
Lightning, strike me!

53
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:40,760
Do not be afraid.

54
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,000
Inez loves you more than her life.

55
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:44,200
Me?

56
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,070
She wants to meet you at
the same spot tomorrow at sunset.

57
00:06:26,850 --> 00:06:31,310
I understand that at your age,
you don't feel like marriage.

58
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,580
However, I find your excuse very strange.

59
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:39,600
Your father crossed many seas
to set up as a merchant in Cádiz.

60
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:42,570
You're lucky, I've fixed everything.

61
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:48,630
Señor Don Roque, do one more thing for me:

62
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,000
Do not go to Buen Retiro.

63
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,510
Fair Inez won't be there,
but I must sit once more

64
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:59,950
on the same bench and
weep over my misfortune.

65
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:06,350
There's something very offensive
in your words.

66
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:11,160
they seem to infer some lack of appreciation
on your part.

67
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,280
Señor.

68
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:25,000
Jasmine breathes the balmy fragrance,

69
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,940
the trees grow greener
as you pass under them.

70
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:36,920
What will happen to a heart which you honour?

71
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:49,100
I could let you cry in misery alone,

72
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:54,000
but fair Inez may come,
and who will repair your nonsense?

73
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:58,170
What's this?

74
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:03,510
To kill time, I suggest I tell you a story,

75
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,210
in which you will find
many instructive events.

76
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,950
I always had a talent for the law.

77
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,850
I wanted to know people and life.

78
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:52,430
What is it?

79
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,660
What's the matter?

80
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,890
Oh, fearsome head!

81
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,890
I thought it was one of my relatives

82
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,830
with whom I was to have an important talk.

83
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:30,730
I don't know you or the reason
for this unexpected visit.

84
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,460
I had no intention of entering your room.

85
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,970
I just wanted to know who lives here.

86
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,540
I am a lawyer, studying people's lives.

87
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:43,770
That's different.

88
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,650
Nothing's more pleasant than knowing
what people are doing.

89
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:52,120
Before you woke up, señora,
your husband honoured me

90
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:56,820
by thinking my face was a fearsome head.

91
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,140
And she

92
00:10:13,210 --> 00:10:18,170
Señor Don Roque, time is passing.

93
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,580
Don Lopez, when a decent man
is telling you a fascinating story,

94
00:10:22,650 --> 00:10:24,680
you should not interrupt him.

95
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:27,820
No, no explanations!

96
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:29,660
This woman...

97
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:34,390
Let me explain everything.

98
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:41,890
I am the daughter of a brave officer.

99
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:44,810
My name is Frasquita Salero.

100
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:52,810
I attracted men, even when I was a young girl.

101
00:10:52,890 --> 00:10:56,220
Frasquita, Frasquita, be modest!

102
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:00,320
Be reasonable, Mama!

103
00:11:00,390 --> 00:11:05,890
How can I be bad
with such elegant caballeros?

104
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,910
Haven't you dropped something?

105
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,890
Too bad for me.

106
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:31,720
If you had dropped that little cross,

107
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:35,020
I would have picked it up
and kept it as a dear souvenir.

108
00:11:44,770 --> 00:11:47,760
Frasquita, get away from the window.

109
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:20,470
Unfortunately,
the young man never showed up again.

110
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,480
My beautiful wife.

111
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:33,610
My sweetness.

112
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,080
Do you love your hubby?

113
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,310
I do.

114
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,890
And nobody else?

115
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,390
Nobody.

116
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,310
What do you have there, son?

117
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:04,040
A letter for Señora Frasquita.

118
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:06,680
Give it to me.

119
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,450
I am her father.

120
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:10,650
Here.

121
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,060
A ring?

122
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,190
What ring?

123
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,730
"I am waiting for you and
yearning for you, Peña Flor."

124
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:41,070
Frasquita, do you love me?

125
00:13:41,150 --> 00:13:42,640
I do.

126
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:51,990
Then there are no obstacles to our love.

127
00:14:08,650 --> 00:14:10,440
Perfect, Don Ramino!

128
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,640
If you go on like that
with the noble Count Peña Flor,

129
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,710
he won't be a nightmare to husbands any more

130
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:20,850
What if I put an end to his conquests?

131
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,450
I'm afraid of the effects of such a duel.

132
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,930
If I could have 100 doubloons,

133
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:32,760
I would wait out in the islands.

134
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:40,240
I'll gladly offer you 100
for such a noble cause.

135
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:20,710
The count was murdered last night.

136
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:21,750
Peña Flor!

137
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,310
From the letter we found on
one of the criminals, we know that

138
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:36,160
you offered 100 doubloons for
the crime to be carried out.

139
00:15:36,230 --> 00:15:39,860
I have never set eyes on Señor Peña Flor.

140
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:43,100
Yesterday,
two men came with a promissory note

141
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:47,670
for 100 doubloons which I signed a year ago.

142
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,340
Shall I show you?

143
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,110
No, I am a member of the criminal court,

144
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:55,420
and I am not interested in trade.

145
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:57,350
That will be all.

146
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,680
Excuse us for the inconvenience.

147
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:15,100
Did you really order this señor to be killed?

148
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,670
Why should you care?
Do you know him?

149
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:27,150
I would go on a pilgrimage
to St. James of Compostela

150
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,890
and even a greater distance,
if I believed it could help me.

151
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,490
A wonderful story.

152
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,580
Yes.

153
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:41,290
Since then, strange things
have been happening in the house.

154
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:58,480
Here are your 100 doubloons back!

155
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,240
Don Diego!

156
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:41,430
I like it.

157
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:47,760
Needless to say,
Count Peña Flor was only made up

158
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,800
to upset my husband and make him
go on a pilgrimage!

159
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:59,070
The justice clerks, as well as the thugs,
were all paid off.

160
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,610
Now I understand "the fearsome head".

161
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:10,320
And you understand why I thought
you were somebody else.

162
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,450
I haven't finished yet, señor!

163
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,990
Later!

164
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:16,080
My duties are calling me.

165
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,100
Do you want to offend me, señor?

166
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,430
Yes, as there is no other way
to get rid of you.

167
00:18:27,070 --> 00:18:29,700
Your daddy will surely be glad.

168
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,280
Now.

169
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:51,190
Where was I?

170
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,690
That same night,

171
00:18:56,770 --> 00:19:00,700
I found myself in entirely
different circumstances.

172
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:14,350
You are lucky only to be injured,
not deprived of life.

173
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:17,440
Easy, easy.

174
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,850
I've taken things into my own hands.

175
00:19:19,930 --> 00:19:22,090
Things will work out okay for you.

176
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,390
But it's too bad you interrupted my story

177
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:28,990
at such an interesting point.

178
00:19:29,070 --> 00:19:30,790
So, listen.

179
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,960
That same night...

180
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:37,100
I found myself in entirely
different circumstances.

181
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,810
Well, and what next?

182
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,680
Señor... Don Lopez.

183
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:24,020
You shouldn't strain yourself, señor.

184
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,600
It's so long.

185
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:36,060
Who is it from?

186
00:20:36,130 --> 00:20:38,430
A child, a complete child.

187
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,730
From fair Inez, of course.

188
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,770
It's done.
But what is it?

189
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,800
You are supposed to be at her place tonight.

190
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,580
The wedding is tomorrow!
Isn't it enough?

191
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:53,850
What place?
Moro's house?

192
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,980
Tell me how.
The simple way.

193
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,990
But the house is guarded.
The old, well known way.

194
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,720
Take it easy.

195
00:21:02,790 --> 00:21:04,660
I'll take care of it.

196
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,620
I don't know.

197
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,100
What would you do without me, señor?

198
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,990
Which window?

199
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:41,490
First, second, third.

200
00:21:41,570 --> 00:21:43,690
Which one?

201
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:45,290
Third!

202
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,900
The window of fair Inez.

203
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,410
My heart is pounding.

204
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:59,610
I am moved, and please,
do not bring any shame on me.

205
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:06,320
My gratitude, señor, but now
we have to use the ultimate means.

206
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:12,020
When I clap my hands, go up to heaven!

207
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,220
Ready?

208
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,260
Ready!

209
00:22:24,540 --> 00:22:26,800
Well.

210
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,000
Balm breathes.

211
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,910
Jasmine does not.

212
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,060
Oh God!

213
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:51,860
Did you die?

214
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,770
I did!

215
00:22:56,840 --> 00:23:03,040
Is there purgatory in the other world?

216
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:08,450
There is one and I am in it!

217
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,960
Was it stormy that night?

218
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,190
Lightning like in hell...
it must be why he got the wrong window.

219
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,630
Señor, I found a purgatorial soul.

220
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,260
Where?

221
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,170
What are you talking about, man?

222
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:57,130
Señor Toledo.

223
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,500
Listen, señor.

224
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,580
So it is the end of my penance.

225
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:23,180
But how did you find out about it?

226
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:26,700
Lopez Suarez told me.

227
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,860
The merchant from Cádiz.

228
00:24:28,930 --> 00:24:30,520
But how did it happen?

229
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,430
Busqueros got the wrong window.

230
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,660
Busqueros?
Ah, Busqueros!

231
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:38,740
I don't know him, but ask him to come by.

232
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,400
I'd like to know more.

233
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:48,380
What do you think?

234
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:51,440
The lady who gave you a hand kerchief...

235
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,610
Is she still faithful to me?
Undoubtedly.

236
00:24:53,690 --> 00:24:55,020
Farewell then.

237
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,930
I made up my mind to find that intruder,

238
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,760
known all over Madrid.

239
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,470
Please, don't stop now.

240
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:15,530
Allow me, señora,
to give a few moments to this man.

241
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,750
Frasquita told her story to Busqueros,

242
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:30,160
he told it to Lopez Suarez,

243
00:25:30,230 --> 00:25:35,100
who in turn told it to Señor Avadoro.

244
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,290
It's enough to drive you crazy.

245
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:39,600
All these adventures begin simply.

246
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:42,330
The listener thinks it'll soon be over,

247
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:46,140
but one story creates another,
and then another.

248
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:52,040
Something like quotients
which can be divided infinitely.

249
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,680
I'm a captain of the guard,
not a philosopher.

250
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:58,650
Your math is just dead numbers.

251
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,220
Señor, this zero, plus and minus one,

252
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:07,600
gave Archimedes and Newton
power equal to the gods.

253
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:09,430
Very noble men.

254
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:11,020
But what's the point of it?

255
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:24,740
We are like blind men lost
in the streets of a big city.

256
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:29,480
The streets lead to a goal,
but we often return

257
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:37,520
to the same places
to get to where we want to be.

258
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:43,230
I can see a few little streets here which,
as it is now,

259
00:26:43,300 --> 00:26:45,600
are going nowhere.

260
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:48,800
New combinations have to be arranged,

261
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:52,240
then the whole will be clear,

262
00:26:52,310 --> 00:26:54,870
because one man cannot invent something

263
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:58,350
that another cannot solve.

264
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,540
I no longer follow.

265
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,740
Then let's keep listening.

266
00:27:05,350 --> 00:27:10,260
Caballero Toledo regained his
former gaiety and balanced soul,

267
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:16,390
and I went to look for that impossible man.

268
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:20,630
I happened to meet him that same day.

269
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,530
I like you, I'll take you as a servant.

270
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,200
Give thanks to heaven

271
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:02,180
that unlimited possibilities
are opening up to you.

272
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,680
I suppose you haven't met many noblemen.

273
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:09,580
I can easily prove that
I was brought up as a gentleman.

274
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:19,590
The fact that I'm a beggar
is down to fate, not birth.

275
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,820
That's fine.

276
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,140
Let's go, señor.

277
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:46,720
At first, your duties
won't seem very attractive,

278
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:51,020
as you won't be paid or have proper clothes.

279
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,560
As for board...

280
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:54,860
Are you by any chance the Don Busqueros

281
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:59,160
to whom Lopez Suarez owes so much?

282
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,790
Yes, that's me.

283
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,770
I'd have ended this whole thing successfully

284
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:08,280
if he hadn't got the wrong window,
but let's be patient.

285
00:29:08,350 --> 00:29:11,180
Caballero Toledo wishes to get to know you.

286
00:29:11,240 --> 00:29:14,850
Toledo?
It's a great honour for me.

287
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:20,290
I found out that Lopez Senior
travelled from Cádiz,

288
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:22,520
and waited at the house,

289
00:29:22,590 --> 00:29:25,030
but having missed his son, went to town.

290
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:26,530
Where to?

291
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:29,330
Where can a provincial man go?

292
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:31,160
To see the church.

293
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,570
Wrong, you noble tramp.

294
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,940
To the tavern.
But which one?

295
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:40,000
The nearest.

296
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,530
But señor, what nonsense.

297
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:16,370
You must admit, Cádiz is a more
important city than Madrid.

298
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:20,140
What's more, Suarez,
who was short of cash, was trading,

299
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,620
thanks to his contacts with Livardez.

300
00:30:23,690 --> 00:30:26,920
Moro, in order to retrieve the money,

301
00:30:26,990 --> 00:30:29,860
had to start a case,
which is still unfinished.

302
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,190
Suarez sued Moro to make him
accept not a million,

303
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:38,930
but two million from the investment.

304
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,300
The Suarez family is the greatest in Spain

305
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:44,900
and you are an ill informed big mouth.

306
00:30:44,970 --> 00:30:47,200
Thank you for your company.

307
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:58,940
I can see, señor,
that you're an honest negotiator.

308
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:02,050
I'm honoured by what you've said.

309
00:31:02,130 --> 00:31:04,720
I'm Gaspar Suarez from Cádiz.

310
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,060
My name is Moraredo.

311
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:09,190
You are heaven sent.

312
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:11,060
I deduced from your talk

313
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:14,730
that you're a true connoisseur of life.

314
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,740
At your service.

315
00:31:16,810 --> 00:31:19,430
I sent my son here,

316
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,340
I forbade him to use the title "Don"
or frequent nobles.

317
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:24,500
Very wise.
Or draw a sword.

318
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:26,280
Understandable.

319
00:31:26,350 --> 00:31:29,910
Just imagine, my Lopez is now Don Lopez,
and the only person

320
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:34,450
he is close to
is a nobleman called Busqueros.

321
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,250
Unbelievable.

322
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:38,490
And he fought him and
was thrown out of the window.

323
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:45,630
I've decided to have him married immediately.

324
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:50,800
Do you know a young lady
from a spotless family?

325
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:52,640
I do.

326
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:54,610
What a lucky coincidence.

327
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:57,150
A reputable merchant also got angry

328
00:31:57,210 --> 00:31:59,770
and said he'd closet her in the monastery

329
00:31:59,850 --> 00:32:03,080
if she doesn't choose a husband this week.

330
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,780
I'd love to talk to her.

331
00:32:04,850 --> 00:32:06,620
You'll meet her today.

332
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,180
What in an inn?

333
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,390
A lady from a good family?

334
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:16,290
Incognito.
We should hurry.

335
00:32:16,370 --> 00:32:18,060
He's paying.

336
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:19,760
Farewell.

337
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,910
Today, more than ever,

338
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,970
you'll understand the value of my friendship.

339
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:46,250
You know, Don Lopez,
such complex tasks are my speciality.

340
00:32:54,940 --> 00:33:00,340
From what I gather,
you know the merchant's life well.

341
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:06,040
But excuse me, Señor...

342
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,850
Moraredo.

343
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:12,680
Your name is not known in merchants' circles.

344
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:14,720
You know, señor...

345
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,690
I presume the situation hasn't allowed you,
so far,

346
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:22,820
to try your hand at a business
conducive to your abilities.

347
00:33:32,410 --> 00:33:36,900
The reason for my behaviour,
señor, is not impertinence.

348
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,210
I came here only because

349
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:43,680
my father's rage forces me to seek salvation.

350
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:46,450
I respect the name of Suarez.

351
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:49,320
Dear lady, I'm honoured.

352
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:55,050
So you intend to marry Señorita Moro.

353
00:33:55,130 --> 00:33:57,990
Señorita Moro?

354
00:33:58,070 --> 00:34:00,730
Are your intentions not serious?

355
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:02,860
There's a misunderstanding!

356
00:34:02,940 --> 00:34:05,170
If you can kneel in front of my sister,

357
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:07,270
you're not too old to duel.

358
00:34:07,350 --> 00:34:08,970
Draw or go out the window!

359
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,240
What?

360
00:34:10,310 --> 00:34:12,410
Your honour is at stake.

361
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,470
I forbid you to have anything to do
with nobility.

362
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:39,870
I only got close to the one
standing next to you.

363
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,910
You shouldn't have duelled.

364
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:45,350
Mind, señor, you've got a sword
in your hand too.

365
00:34:50,750 --> 00:34:54,850
Oh, Lopez, why on earth
did you choose Señorita Moro?

366
00:34:54,930 --> 00:34:58,520
But you yourself were kneeling
at her feet not long ago.

367
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:13,370
The punishment, Señor Gaspar Suarez,
always fits the crime.

368
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:21,650
If your son takes my daughter's hand,
it would be an honour.

369
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:26,780
Although he chose to introduce himself
through the window,

370
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,250
his actions were undoubtedly due to

371
00:35:29,330 --> 00:35:31,550
the grudge over the two million.

372
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:36,400
I'll accept it then,
provided I can add another two million,

373
00:35:36,470 --> 00:35:41,560
and give it all to your son,
along with my daughter's hand.

374
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,550
You've done a good job.

375
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,060
Well done, well done, señor.

376
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:07,930
It's not hard to see how it'll turn out.

377
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:11,060
Lopez was taken to his future
father in law's house,

378
00:36:11,140 --> 00:36:16,840
and with Inez's care, he'll soon recover.

379
00:36:16,910 --> 00:36:22,970
And now I'd like to hear more about
the other affair.

380
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:29,780
Was this woman, Frasquita, so charming then?

381
00:36:32,750 --> 00:36:38,130
I told the story you just mentioned
to a young gentleman.

382
00:36:38,190 --> 00:36:42,290
Yes, yes, and Lopez Suarez
passed it on to my friend,

383
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:45,100
who introduced me to her.

384
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,760
You have an incredible memory, señor.

385
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:50,430
Since you already know Frasquita's story,

386
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:53,240
I should tell the story of her husband,

387
00:36:53,310 --> 00:37:00,340
and how he got to meet
an unfortunate young man.

388
00:37:00,410 --> 00:37:02,820
Go ahead.

389
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,910
That very night,

390
00:37:04,990 --> 00:37:07,980
I found myself in entirely
different circumstances.

391
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,880
Who are you?

392
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,690
This sign shows I'm in the Devil's power.

393
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:24,990
Reprobate, stop persecuting me!

394
00:39:25,060 --> 00:39:27,090
Persecute.

395
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:31,900
What of the doubloons you paid
for Count Peña Flor's head?

396
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:34,340
What do you want of me?

397
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:36,160
You recognise me?

398
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:37,930
As you can see,

399
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:45,180
the count, before his death,
raised the stakes.

400
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:48,150
Don't! Don't!

401
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:10,130
You've given us a pleasant hour, señor.

402
00:40:10,210 --> 00:40:12,680
You have not disappointed me.

403
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:16,640
Excuse me for telling of things
which is a sin in itself,

404
00:40:16,710 --> 00:40:20,110
but it is a very instructive story.

405
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,390
What happened to Señora Cornandez?

406
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:29,150
She became a widow!

407
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:31,490
Then she married her lover,

408
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,860
and ever since, has led a model life.

409
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:35,730
Here she is!

410
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,530
Well?

411
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:41,600
But this is Doña Iscariz.

412
00:40:41,670 --> 00:40:43,540
Frasquita.

413
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:52,280
What can I do?

414
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:57,380
I couldn't. Nor could I!
The only way is...

415
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,190
She said I was her first lover.

416
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,320
There are other women in the world.

417
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:16,600
Toledo?
Señor Toledo!

418
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:18,700
Run!

419
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,570
Don't panic!

420
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,060
I must think it all over again.

421
00:41:40,130 --> 00:41:43,100
More carefully this time.

422
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:44,250
Señor!

423
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,230
Farewell, my friends.

424
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,070
Your sword.

425
00:41:58,410 --> 00:42:01,380
He leads an exhausting life, I must say.

426
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:04,710
There should be a ladder under every window.

427
00:42:07,690 --> 00:42:09,350
Just in case.

428
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:29,770
What's up?

429
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,080
The officers of the guard
are sorting out a problem.

430
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,200
Must have been a dilemma.

431
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:57,640
There were other reasons too.

432
00:43:11,090 --> 00:43:13,110
Is what you said true?

433
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,750
I never back down.

434
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:40,440
If I'm not mistaken,
that brave officer was your father.

435
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:56,190
The chronicles of his duels
mention those events.

436
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:59,660
In order to avoid an argument,
he duelled twice that day,

437
00:43:59,740 --> 00:44:08,940
wounded five in the afternoon
and six more in the evening.

438
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:13,850
He did right, or there'd have been
an unnecessary argument!

439
00:44:13,910 --> 00:44:16,780
And this is the end of the story.

440
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:19,580
You wanted me to tell of my adventures,

441
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:24,420
and I don't think you regret your curiosity.

442
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:26,520
We must part.

443
00:44:26,600 --> 00:44:29,760
The hour of parting...

444
00:44:29,830 --> 00:44:34,460
I'm very sorry...
also has its sweetness.

445
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:43,000
Important affairs are calling you.

446
00:45:01,630 --> 00:45:04,360
But you said...

447
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,350
I don't think, señor,
you've got much time left.

448
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:40,450
Alfonso Van Worden, we're waiting for you.

449
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,720
Who are you?

450
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:43,720
My name will tell you nothing.

451
00:47:43,790 --> 00:47:46,190
Welcome to Gomelez's land.

452
00:49:03,070 --> 00:49:06,560
You must recognise the hermit in me,

453
00:49:06,640 --> 00:49:13,570
and thus guess that
I am the Sheik of the Gomelez.

454
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:19,780
You are here because
you have not disappointed us.

455
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:28,390
Well, I'm a captain of the guard.

456
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:33,870
It's time for me to reveal our secret.

457
00:49:33,940 --> 00:49:38,900
The Prophet has blessed your love.

458
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:47,000
they will both soon be mothers
and continue the family line.

459
00:49:56,960 --> 00:50:00,760
We've been toying with you long enough

460
00:50:00,830 --> 00:50:04,600
to make sure that
your first night in Venta Quemada

461
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:08,000
will be fruitful for the Gomelez family,

462
00:50:08,070 --> 00:50:14,870
as you are the only male heir
to our vanishing line.

463
00:50:17,540 --> 00:50:21,680
Everything you have been through
was a planned game,

464
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:25,880
meant to test your honour and courage.

465
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,860
Your men were the ghosts and spirits?

466
00:50:36,530 --> 00:50:37,960
And the Cabalist?

467
00:50:38,030 --> 00:50:39,860
Yes.

468
00:50:39,930 --> 00:50:42,200
So was Pasheko.

469
00:50:42,270 --> 00:50:45,540
He is a Basque acrobat

470
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:50,870
and he lost an eye performing
some dangerous acrobatics.

471
00:50:55,450 --> 00:51:01,010
If you say Velasquez was also involved,
I won't believe it.

472
00:51:01,090 --> 00:51:02,390
Yes.

473
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:05,550
This heretic caused us a lot of trouble

474
00:51:05,630 --> 00:51:09,090
and we are putting our hopes
in Rebecca's hands.

475
00:51:09,160 --> 00:51:13,620
In this book is everything
you saw and experienced.

476
00:51:13,700 --> 00:51:17,370
Maybe I can put it all in some order at last.

477
00:51:27,120 --> 00:51:30,020
The rest you can write yourself.

478
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:35,680
May Allah send the dew
of happiness on your head.

479
00:51:40,630 --> 00:51:43,390
Kiss him, Zibelda.

480
00:51:47,170 --> 00:51:50,870
I will be happy seeing him in your arms.

481
00:51:58,150 --> 00:52:06,680
Whenever I see you,
I am always afraid I won't see you again.

482
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:12,120
Perhaps we won't meet again.

483
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:16,390
But we want to live in your memory forever.

484
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:22,970
The hour of parting also has its sweetness.

485
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:28,640
But now I know everything,

486
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:34,380
so tell me really who you are.

487
00:52:38,790 --> 00:52:40,520
Close your eyes.

488
00:52:46,230 --> 00:52:50,600
And when you hear your name, follow us.

489
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,870
Now?

490
00:54:27,500 --> 00:54:31,400
Can we make it before dark?

491
00:54:31,470 --> 00:54:34,060
We can.

492
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:36,500
This time we can.

493
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:38,200
For sure.

494
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:58,090
Where have you been?

495
00:54:58,160 --> 00:54:59,990
The mules have escaped.

496
00:55:00,060 --> 00:55:01,960
Off we go on our way.

497
00:55:02,030 --> 00:55:03,330
And hurry!

498
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,230
You must see to him.

499
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:06,690
A nice room and some peace are
the advantages of our inn.

500
00:56:06,760 --> 00:56:14,760
For a long time, they thought I was missing.

501
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,670
Everybody was overjoyed to see me.

502
00:56:17,740 --> 00:56:23,000
Only the Sheik was saddened to see me weak

503
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:29,540
and my health damaged.

504
00:56:31,020 --> 00:56:37,120
A meal for the señor, quick.

505
00:56:37,190 --> 00:56:43,030
Two foreign ladies,
who are spending the night at this inn,

506
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:46,560
would like to invite you for supper.

507
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,360
What's that?
Where?

508
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:17,350
The End
