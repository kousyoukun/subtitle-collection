489
00:00:12,006 --> 00:00:14,500
According to our system,

490
00:00:14,576 --> 00:00:19,513
we allow the prisoner
the freedom to accuse himself.

491
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:22,847
His confession, even though slightly forced,

492
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:25,786
has its advantages,

493
00:00:25,855 --> 00:00:31,384
when the prisoner is willing
to name his collaborators.

494
00:00:43,439 --> 00:00:46,929
Do you know two African princesses?

495
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,140
The longer your silence,
the worse I'll be for you.

496
00:00:54,216 --> 00:01:00,417
I can see I'm going to have to help you.

497
00:01:00,490 --> 00:01:03,926
Let's start the first trial.

498
00:01:13,503 --> 00:01:16,802
You're going to faint soon,

499
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:22,402
but with salt and alcohol,
we'll bring you round.

500
00:01:23,912 --> 00:01:26,608
Let's start the second trial

501
00:01:26,683 --> 00:01:33,521
Alfonso!
You're saved, Alfonso!

502
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:39,495
Señor Zoto is coming to rescue you.

503
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:41,325
Dear Alfonso!

504
00:01:44,367 --> 00:01:47,233
You've shown great courage, dear cousin.

505
00:01:47,302 --> 00:01:49,828
This is no time for kisses.

506
00:01:49,906 --> 00:01:53,536
By the time the guards arrive,
you should be far away.

507
00:01:53,608 --> 00:01:56,578
This is Señor Zoto.

508
00:01:56,646 --> 00:02:01,174
Señor Alfonso, I have the honour
of introducing my brothers,

509
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:02,480
Chico...

510
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:08,319
Muma and Chico.

511
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,449
How come, Zoto?

512
00:02:10,526 --> 00:02:12,890
Your brothers were hanged, weren't they?

513
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:15,329
You heard right.

514
00:02:15,399 --> 00:02:19,062
But as you can see for yourself,
they're fine.

515
00:02:19,134 --> 00:02:22,194
But I saw them my self!

516
00:02:22,271 --> 00:02:28,233
What you saw were two shepherds,
hung to pacify the neighbourhood.

517
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:31,906
This is unbelievable.

518
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:35,883
Undoubtedly, it's thanks to our horses.

519
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:42,084
I'm pleased to see you are yourself again.

520
00:02:42,157 --> 00:02:45,423
Bless you, señor.

521
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:47,985
They're surrounding us.

522
00:02:48,062 --> 00:02:52,228
Chico, you cover us
while we get to the horses.

523
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:58,502
Where's my sword?

524
00:02:58,574 --> 00:03:00,164
My sword!

525
00:04:25,062 --> 00:04:28,588
Kiss me.

526
00:04:35,973 --> 00:04:37,463
And me.

527
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,600
Oh, how happy I am.

528
00:04:41,677 --> 00:04:43,872
Are you pleased about our meeting, cousin?

529
00:04:47,617 --> 00:04:51,576
Cousin, this locket is horrible.

530
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:57,420
It's cooling our passion towards you.

531
00:05:48,978 --> 00:05:52,608
Are you happy, cousin?

532
00:05:52,682 --> 00:05:58,052
Yes, although I must say
that the end of the night

533
00:05:58,122 --> 00:06:03,389
I spent with you, didn't please me at all.

534
00:06:03,459 --> 00:06:06,519
You'd better accuse us with pleasures.

535
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:09,225
It wasn't so nice in the morning.

536
00:06:09,298 --> 00:06:12,927
Let's say no more about it.

537
00:06:13,002 --> 00:06:18,235
Here's a plait made of our hair, a talisman

538
00:06:18,307 --> 00:06:20,206
to remind you of us.

539
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:23,435
Talisman?

540
00:06:23,514 --> 00:06:26,879
It's widely assumed
one can only love one woman.

541
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:29,177
It's a fallacy.

542
00:06:29,252 --> 00:06:31,913
I fell in love with you both equally.

543
00:06:31,987 --> 00:06:34,615
My heart sees no difference.

544
00:06:34,689 --> 00:06:36,591
Adopt our faith.

545
00:06:36,658 --> 00:06:39,389
You would sit on the throne in Tunis

546
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:43,728
among harems, gardens and fountains.

547
00:06:43,798 --> 00:06:45,288
No, no.

548
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:48,427
Let's not talk about kingdoms
flooded with sunshine.

549
00:06:48,504 --> 00:06:51,495
We're in the abyss, close to Hell.

550
00:06:55,946 --> 00:07:04,750
How dare you be in the company
of Golomez women!

551
00:07:04,821 --> 00:07:08,346
Cousin, you're done for!

552
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:09,947
Forgive us.

553
00:07:10,026 --> 00:07:13,826
Either you'll be killed
like a coward with an axe

554
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:17,831
and your corpse hung next
to the Zota brothers

555
00:07:17,899 --> 00:07:22,461
at the mercy of crows and devilish powers, or

556
00:07:22,538 --> 00:07:24,004
But the brothers

557
00:07:24,072 --> 00:07:29,740
Or you'll drink the potion from this chalice.

558
00:07:29,812 --> 00:07:31,677
Gulp it down!

559
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:48,093
Father, you'd do the same in
the name of honour, wouldn't you?

560
00:08:43,384 --> 00:08:46,845
What an unpleasant misunderstanding.

561
00:08:46,923 --> 00:08:50,051
Evil spirits take so many shapes,

562
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,288
it's completely confusing.

563
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,556
You're here too?

564
00:08:53,629 --> 00:08:55,187
You're too young to be a Cabalist,

565
00:08:55,264 --> 00:08:59,725
though you too are carrying
a rope around your neck.

566
00:08:59,802 --> 00:09:01,668
Don't worry.

567
00:09:01,738 --> 00:09:03,763
You are brave, I know,

568
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,365
though you've not had much experience.

569
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:10,173
You're Alfonso?

570
00:09:10,245 --> 00:09:12,509
Your mother is a Gomelez

571
00:09:12,581 --> 00:09:14,846
and you are a captain of the Walloon Guard.

572
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:18,884
Let's leave this unpleasant place

573
00:09:18,955 --> 00:09:21,219
and decide what to do next.

574
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,052
My name is Alfonso Van Worden.

575
00:09:25,293 --> 00:09:26,725
That's evident.

576
00:09:27,964 --> 00:09:30,259
I can see you have mellowed.

577
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:33,528
I have a miraculous potion
to restore your strength.

578
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:38,096
No, no, no more miraculous potions!

579
00:09:42,812 --> 00:09:44,610
Where are you going, señor?

580
00:09:44,681 --> 00:09:45,807
To Madrid.

581
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:47,144
Good.

582
00:09:47,216 --> 00:09:51,711
On our way we'll stop at a place
where I left a good meal.

583
00:09:51,788 --> 00:09:54,153
Not miraculous, but sumptuous.

584
00:09:56,426 --> 00:09:59,759
Now listen, the books of Nach Sou Chasi

585
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:02,321
contain wise Chaldean knowledge,

586
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,889
while the verses of Shir Ha Shi Mir

587
00:10:04,966 --> 00:10:07,331
contain the purest beauty of poetry.

588
00:10:07,403 --> 00:10:09,701
In Hebrew, every letter is a number,

589
00:10:09,773 --> 00:10:11,764
every word a very wise combination.

590
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:15,004
If it is pronounced with
the right exhalation and accent,

591
00:10:15,076 --> 00:10:20,038
one may move mountains and drain rivers.

592
00:10:20,115 --> 00:10:24,451
You must know that Adonai
created the world with a word...

593
00:10:29,259 --> 00:10:32,057
Someone played a joke on me here last night,

594
00:10:32,129 --> 00:10:33,687
But let's go in anyway.

595
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,298
My horse!

596
00:10:38,368 --> 00:10:39,663
Unbelievable!

597
00:10:39,735 --> 00:10:41,134
Mine too.

598
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:46,336
I don't understand.

599
00:10:46,408 --> 00:10:48,399
The horse follows his master.

600
00:10:51,014 --> 00:10:56,951
It's lucky that devils do not need food.

601
00:11:36,259 --> 00:11:38,850
Good, isn't it?

602
00:11:38,927 --> 00:11:40,326
What's good?

603
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:42,259
Just asking.

604
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:44,163
I am pleased to be able
to satisfy your hunger.

605
00:11:47,269 --> 00:11:48,326
What's that?

606
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:53,605
It must be your property.

607
00:11:56,745 --> 00:11:59,374
Then you too have spent
the night here?

608
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,149
Yes, but I won't tell you the whole story.

609
00:12:06,288 --> 00:12:08,221
It was a wonderful night...

610
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:11,120
in spite of everything.

611
00:12:11,192 --> 00:12:13,355
In spite of what?

612
00:12:13,427 --> 00:12:15,091
I have also given my word.

613
00:12:15,163 --> 00:12:17,860
To whom?
Two beautiful women,

614
00:12:17,932 --> 00:12:19,956
but do not ask for more.

615
00:12:24,508 --> 00:12:26,634
Let's set off.

616
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,941
It's still a long way to Madrid.

617
00:12:30,013 --> 00:12:34,245
Do you know a quicker way, señor?

618
00:12:34,317 --> 00:12:36,716
Yes, that way.

619
00:12:36,783 --> 00:12:40,379
That's where the Inquisition fell upon me.

620
00:12:40,456 --> 00:12:44,291
You're right, it's better to avoid an ambush.

621
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:54,336
Is there any other path?

622
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:56,998
Of course, for a Cabalist.

623
00:12:57,072 --> 00:13:00,336
We'll go around and come out
on the one to Madrid.

624
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:27,993
Seter So Har shows us
the depth of the ten elements,

625
00:13:28,071 --> 00:13:32,129
creating integrity of taste.

626
00:13:32,206 --> 00:13:34,267
All this enables us

627
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:36,812
to get to the powers ruling pandemonium.

628
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:39,211
Must you always talk in riddles?

629
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:41,182
It makes my journey more interesting.

630
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,947
And they rule nightmares and demons,

631
00:13:44,019 --> 00:13:48,581
among which we can distinguish
Hungarian and Polish zombies...

632
00:14:23,557 --> 00:14:24,956
Help!

633
00:14:30,133 --> 00:14:32,931
I arrest you in the name of the Inquisition!

634
00:14:33,003 --> 00:14:35,368
Give up your sword!

635
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:38,428
Do not resist, Alfonso Van Worden!

636
00:14:38,508 --> 00:14:40,874
I am Don Pedro Velasquez!

637
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:42,807
Are you crazy, señores?

638
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:44,243
Indeed.

639
00:14:54,057 --> 00:14:56,423
It's not him.
Who is he?

640
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,721
Don Pedro.

641
00:14:57,793 --> 00:15:00,854
He looks rather similar.
What are you doing here?

642
00:15:00,928 --> 00:15:04,422
I thought the roads were for everybody.

643
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,490
Señores bandits!

644
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,195
There is no road here.

645
00:15:08,269 --> 00:15:09,668
Get off!

646
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:11,899
He must have gone the other way.

647
00:15:15,244 --> 00:15:18,211
Maybe he went back to Venta Quemada.

648
00:15:18,278 --> 00:15:20,749
I was told he was coming this way.

649
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:23,784
You don't seem eager
to apologise for this mistake.

650
00:15:23,851 --> 00:15:25,787
Stop bothering us!

651
00:15:25,855 --> 00:15:28,947
In that case, I will apologise
to the honourable señores.

652
00:15:37,331 --> 00:15:39,528
A thorn.

653
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,760
There is nothing with which to take it out.

654
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:12,528
And there is no place to hide,

655
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,230
just to examine the situation, of course.

656
00:16:28,451 --> 00:16:30,850
Señor Alfonso Van Worden?

657
00:16:30,918 --> 00:16:35,653
Some ill mannered thugs await you over there.

658
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:37,157
The Inquisition?

659
00:16:37,225 --> 00:16:38,591
Yes.

660
00:16:38,659 --> 00:16:40,821
Why should the Inquisition be here?

661
00:16:40,894 --> 00:16:43,385
they didn't recognise you weren't Van Worden?

662
00:16:43,465 --> 00:16:46,865
they probably didn't, if they held me up.

663
00:16:46,933 --> 00:16:48,926
That's what logic would dictate.

664
00:16:52,575 --> 00:16:54,008
And what now?

665
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:57,942
You will ride to my castle,
señor, a few miles away.

666
00:16:58,013 --> 00:17:00,743
You have a castle in the neighbourhood?

667
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:02,340
You didn't mention it.

668
00:17:02,417 --> 00:17:05,284
It just proves the beauty of modesty.

669
00:17:05,355 --> 00:17:07,084
What if they find me?

670
00:17:07,154 --> 00:17:09,817
they cannot enter my castle.
We'll take the shortest route.

671
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:12,623
If I too could take advantage
of your hospitality,

672
00:17:12,692 --> 00:17:15,220
I could hope for a quiet night.

673
00:17:15,298 --> 00:17:19,288
Knowing the señor Cabalist,
I know he won't refuse shelter.

674
00:17:19,366 --> 00:17:20,731
Yes, of course.

675
00:17:20,804 --> 00:17:22,201
Thank you.

676
00:17:22,269 --> 00:17:24,297
I will have time to reconsider

677
00:17:24,374 --> 00:17:26,171
everything that's happened to me.

678
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:29,439
That could drive
an inexperienced person insane.

679
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:32,037
The human mind is ready to accept anything,

680
00:17:32,115 --> 00:17:34,515
if it is used knowingly.

681
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:54,969
End of Part One

682
00:17:58,842 --> 00:18:05,805
The Saragossa Manuscript,
Part Two

683
00:18:48,221 --> 00:18:50,712
Enrico, the master has arrived!

684
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:52,317
Has something happened?

685
00:18:52,394 --> 00:18:53,692
I don't know.

686
00:18:56,298 --> 00:19:00,028
Let's rest after the rigours of the journey.

687
00:19:00,103 --> 00:19:02,798
Señor, you're completely safe here.

688
00:19:02,872 --> 00:19:05,337
My house is at your disposal.

689
00:19:05,405 --> 00:19:07,035
Fifteenth century.

690
00:19:07,107 --> 00:19:08,972
You're an expert on everything.

691
00:19:09,045 --> 00:19:12,640
Curiosity distinguishes us from animals.

692
00:19:12,712 --> 00:19:15,010
I look, listen and draw conclusions.

693
00:19:15,084 --> 00:19:21,990
Señor, I am pleased to have met you
and to be in your company.

694
00:19:22,057 --> 00:19:27,325
Good company is more precious
than wealth or black magic.

695
00:19:27,394 --> 00:19:30,161
Gentlemen, this is not
the place for disputes.

696
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:31,894
Please go in.

697
00:19:31,968 --> 00:19:33,730
Enrico, show the gentlemen the way.

698
00:19:51,019 --> 00:19:52,780
You were to be here in three days time.

699
00:19:52,855 --> 00:19:55,153
Unforeseeable complications.

700
00:19:55,221 --> 00:19:56,851
Everything got mixed up.

701
00:19:56,923 --> 00:19:57,950
And what now?

702
00:19:58,027 --> 00:20:00,356
What now?
I don't know.

703
00:20:00,430 --> 00:20:03,692
We must keep him here.
I await new instructions.

704
00:20:03,766 --> 00:20:06,394
Who's the other one?

705
00:20:06,469 --> 00:20:08,434
Careful!

706
00:20:08,501 --> 00:20:10,163
Ask no more.

707
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:13,365
Go and make yourself becoming.

708
00:20:13,442 --> 00:20:15,000
You might have told me.

709
00:20:15,076 --> 00:20:18,172
You're boring me, my dear.
It was not possible.

710
00:20:20,016 --> 00:20:22,883
I have the impression
that all this is happening

711
00:20:22,951 --> 00:20:25,682
because of evil spirits.

712
00:20:25,755 --> 00:20:28,586
I'd rather blame people, señor.

713
00:20:28,655 --> 00:20:30,853
Someone must be after you

714
00:20:30,924 --> 00:20:34,155
to put you through all these misfortunes.

715
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:39,133
I'm in your debt, señor,
as it seems that thanks to you,

716
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:41,394
I'll find the key to this riddle.

717
00:20:41,471 --> 00:20:42,938
I like it here.

718
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:45,201
Peace and quiet.

719
00:20:45,271 --> 00:20:48,334
Think it all through once again.

720
00:20:57,586 --> 00:21:00,019
have all your needs been met, señor?

721
00:21:02,490 --> 00:21:04,548
I don't know how to thank you.

722
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:07,115
Not at all.
Make yourself at home.

723
00:21:07,193 --> 00:21:09,559
Thank you. I feel fine here,

724
00:21:09,632 --> 00:21:12,624
I'm really well.

725
00:21:12,701 --> 00:21:15,170
I've thought everything through.

726
00:21:15,238 --> 00:21:17,229
And?

727
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:22,605
It'd be best for me to go to Madrid
as soon as possible.

728
00:21:22,678 --> 00:21:28,708
I hope I'll be able to make it in the dark.

729
00:21:28,785 --> 00:21:32,016
The Inquisition is still
guarding all the roads.

730
00:21:36,526 --> 00:21:40,326
Maybe Señor Velasquez has some good advice?

731
00:21:40,394 --> 00:21:42,660
He's an unbeliever.

732
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:44,393
What shall I do then?

733
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:45,865
Wait.

734
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,942
You have books here.

735
00:22:03,019 --> 00:22:07,979
All the wisdom in the world
is to be found on these shelves.

736
00:22:12,595 --> 00:22:15,528
I particularly recommend the Spanish stories.

737
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,493
Señor Don Pedro, I've found the answer.

738
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:04,265
Let's have some wine.

739
00:24:04,337 --> 00:24:06,928
Perhaps this midnight oil will mark our vigil

740
00:24:07,005 --> 00:24:08,265
for the last time tonight.

741
00:24:08,342 --> 00:24:11,573
Come, señor, please,
I'd like to show you something.

742
00:24:11,645 --> 00:24:13,438
You're sad.

743
00:24:13,513 --> 00:24:15,880
Let's drink this fine wine.

744
00:24:15,948 --> 00:24:21,544
We'll all soon come to rest
in the eternal night.

745
00:24:21,621 --> 00:24:23,714
How could you be so careless?

746
00:24:23,790 --> 00:24:25,587
If he had read the end,

747
00:24:25,659 --> 00:24:28,388
the events which are to follow
would make no sense.

748
00:24:32,130 --> 00:24:34,601
Luckily, I arrived in time.

749
00:24:54,188 --> 00:24:56,712
Strange things are happening here, señor.

750
00:24:59,493 --> 00:25:07,025
I've seen it with my own eyes,
I even had it in my own hands.

751
00:25:07,101 --> 00:25:10,967
It must be all due to the evil spirits.

752
00:25:13,169 --> 00:25:17,837
I understand, señor,
that your mind is rebelling against

753
00:25:17,909 --> 00:25:25,842
inexplicable phenomena,
but be so kind as to explain in detail.

754
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:33,688
What are you looking for, señor?

755
00:25:36,226 --> 00:25:38,323
There was a book here.

756
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,696
I saw the gallows.

757
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,630
Where has it gone?

758
00:25:42,703 --> 00:25:43,928
Here?

759
00:25:44,003 --> 00:25:45,832
There's never been a book like that here.

760
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,976
Demons again?

761
00:25:56,049 --> 00:25:58,380
they are tiring, I admit.

762
00:25:58,448 --> 00:26:02,319
Unfortunately, the world is full of them.

763
00:26:02,388 --> 00:26:06,154
Incantations stop their mischief.

764
00:26:06,226 --> 00:26:07,851
Nonsense.

765
00:26:07,928 --> 00:26:10,861
Don't you believe in incantations then?

766
00:26:10,928 --> 00:26:12,553
No.

767
00:26:12,630 --> 00:26:14,755
What if I prove it?

768
00:26:14,832 --> 00:26:19,996
Only if I can perform them my self.

769
00:26:20,073 --> 00:26:21,540
Go on, señor.

770
00:26:21,609 --> 00:26:25,169
This is not the place
for philosophical disputes.

771
00:26:35,321 --> 00:26:37,582
I am so glad to see you, brother.

772
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:39,919
When did you get back?

773
00:26:39,993 --> 00:26:43,428
This is Alfonso Van Worden,
captain of the guard.

774
00:26:43,496 --> 00:26:46,428
Captain, my sister Rebbecca.

775
00:26:48,935 --> 00:26:51,369
Don Pedro Velasquez.

776
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:52,563
Señora.

777
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,732
I will do my best.

778
00:26:54,803 --> 00:26:58,607
I am glad to convince you
of the power of the supernatural.

779
00:26:58,678 --> 00:27:00,438
Of course.

780
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:03,207
From Aristotle came the
principle that in the mind...

781
00:27:06,185 --> 00:27:10,813
Señor Alfonso, I implore you
to tell me what you think

782
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:18,592
of everything you've experienced
since arriving here.

783
00:27:18,665 --> 00:27:21,294
I wouldn't know where to start.

784
00:27:21,368 --> 00:27:24,198
I must have been put to sleep with a potion

785
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,236
and taken to the gallows.

786
00:27:27,303 --> 00:27:31,904
Then you got under
the Zota brothers' gallows?

787
00:27:31,976 --> 00:27:34,446
And found them both hanged?

788
00:27:36,351 --> 00:27:39,909
Do they, by any chance,
have the habit of coming down?

789
00:27:39,986 --> 00:27:42,717
Very often, usually at night.

790
00:27:47,895 --> 00:27:50,089
Your hand shows that

791
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:54,659
you are possessed with love for the demons.

792
00:27:54,734 --> 00:27:57,563
Such people have no fear of humans.

793
00:27:57,637 --> 00:27:59,265
I am afraid of nobody.

794
00:28:02,542 --> 00:28:04,511
I am afraid for you.

795
00:28:26,366 --> 00:28:28,630
I am so glad they came.

796
00:28:30,938 --> 00:28:34,395
Gaiety and fun will prevail now.

797
00:28:36,275 --> 00:28:40,976
I am sorry, señora,
but I have different plans.

798
00:28:41,044 --> 00:28:43,073
Whatever your decision,

799
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:48,212
you won't refuse to spend
a few hours in our company.

800
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:05,534
Your brother is greeting a gypsy so warmly.

801
00:29:05,601 --> 00:29:07,869
A gypsy?

802
00:29:07,938 --> 00:29:11,169
You'll see in a while what a gypsy he is.

803
00:29:17,650 --> 00:29:19,707
Welcome, Señor Alfonso.

804
00:29:19,784 --> 00:29:21,981
How do you know who I am?

805
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:25,319
Our camp moves from one place to another,

806
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:29,380
and my daughters keep
their eyes and ears open.

807
00:29:39,338 --> 00:29:42,303
An enchanted place.

808
00:29:42,375 --> 00:29:45,101
The people of the Sierra
are afraid to go near.

809
00:29:45,178 --> 00:29:48,169
I have no reason to tell them they're wrong.

810
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:52,775
It is better that most of
my retinue was left outside.

811
00:29:52,851 --> 00:29:56,118
Señor Avadoro, in this errant life

812
00:29:56,188 --> 00:29:58,886
you must have encountered
many unusual adventures.

813
00:30:02,462 --> 00:30:04,053
I have.

814
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,722
Then tell us,

815
00:30:05,794 --> 00:30:08,494
and Señor Velasquez will
teach us how to experience poetry

816
00:30:08,569 --> 00:30:10,794
without the help of ghosts.

817
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:12,770
I do not succumb to ghosts,

818
00:30:12,839 --> 00:30:17,775
but I fear your magic power, señora.

819
00:30:18,342 --> 00:30:23,338
I reckon that from one end
of the world to the other,

820
00:30:23,417 --> 00:30:26,438
the story of love is always the same.

821
00:30:32,659 --> 00:30:36,856
I think you will enjoy hearing
about my youthful adventures.

822
00:30:38,496 --> 00:30:43,698
Some are surprising,
I could even say, miraculous.

823
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:51,436
Whenever I go back to those
long gone times of my life,

824
00:30:54,313 --> 00:30:57,214
I hear the noise of a variety of passions

825
00:30:57,284 --> 00:30:59,476
and a mixed roaring of storms.

826
00:31:34,688 --> 00:31:38,746
You seem wiser than others,
and I have a delicate problem.

827
00:31:38,823 --> 00:31:40,486
Will you follow me?

828
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,707
I am the lover of a certain young person.

829
00:31:57,775 --> 00:32:02,578
She tends, I think, to be fickle.

830
00:32:02,650 --> 00:32:05,981
When you see a woman whose dress suits this,

831
00:32:06,053 --> 00:32:08,746
you'll see whether she goes to church,

832
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:12,154
or in another direction.

833
00:32:12,226 --> 00:32:13,453
Here.

834
00:32:14,926 --> 00:32:16,953
You'll get another if you do well.

835
00:32:17,029 --> 00:32:19,188
You're her husband, not her lover.

836
00:32:19,265 --> 00:32:22,962
I'm paying you to discover treason,
not who I am.

837
00:32:23,034 --> 00:32:26,025
Sharpen your sight, it's time for vespers.

838
00:32:26,102 --> 00:32:27,571
I'll wait at the inn.

839
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,803
Of lovers.
Of lovers.

840
00:33:10,082 --> 00:33:14,880
What is this?
Your beauty troubled me.

841
00:33:14,953 --> 00:33:17,544
Somebody suspects you of betraying him.

842
00:33:17,621 --> 00:33:19,111
Follow me.

843
00:33:21,127 --> 00:33:23,493
You will give this to Caballero Toledo.

844
00:33:37,109 --> 00:33:40,169
Noble caballero.

845
00:33:40,246 --> 00:33:43,476
My conscience forbids me taking
payment from both sides.

846
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:43,900
What is my fortune?

847
00:34:45,844 --> 00:34:48,143
We'll get married under a big chestnut tree.

848
00:34:49,382 --> 00:34:51,713
Nature will accept our vows.

849
00:34:51,784 --> 00:34:56,244
The rosy glow of dawn will bless us.

850
00:34:56,322 --> 00:34:59,155
I've lost Caballero Toledo's address.

851
00:34:59,226 --> 00:35:01,820
He invited me to a grand feast.

852
00:35:01,896 --> 00:35:04,989
On the other side of the square.

853
00:35:05,065 --> 00:35:06,588
Until we meet again.

854
00:35:06,666 --> 00:35:07,927
Maybe.

855
00:36:42,628 --> 00:36:45,063
Señor Toledo,

856
00:36:45,130 --> 00:36:49,226
a lady wanted me to give you
this little token.

857
00:36:49,302 --> 00:36:55,103
I appreciate your wit, my friend, and honour.

858
00:37:05,753 --> 00:37:08,914
Would you like to become one of my servants?

859
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:12,219
That's impossible, I was born a nobleman.

860
00:37:12,293 --> 00:37:14,760
I chose the position of beggar

861
00:37:14,829 --> 00:37:17,956
as it does not dim a nobleman's jewel.

862
00:37:18,030 --> 00:37:21,123
An answer worthy of a Spaniard!

863
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,690
Let's have a drink.

864
00:37:27,739 --> 00:37:32,507
Human life is fragile.

865
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:34,478
Why these dark thoughts, señor?

866
00:37:38,083 --> 00:37:39,985
I am a sinner.

867
00:37:55,333 --> 00:37:59,704
I used to leave one mistress for another,
but I concluded that

868
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:03,106
I was losing too much time that way,

869
00:38:03,177 --> 00:38:06,077
so I started a new affair before
having broken off the last,

870
00:38:06,146 --> 00:38:09,911
and while planning a third.

871
00:38:09,983 --> 00:38:13,007
Spanish women have something...

872
00:38:13,085 --> 00:38:14,643
insistent.

873
00:38:14,722 --> 00:38:16,585
I swore love to each.

874
00:38:16,655 --> 00:38:18,681
The punishment for
breaking oaths is terrible.

875
00:38:21,128 --> 00:38:23,525
Indeed, in the other world.

876
00:38:28,702 --> 00:38:31,431
Yesterday, a friend from Malta visited.

877
00:38:31,503 --> 00:38:34,632
His name is Aquillar,

878
00:38:34,708 --> 00:38:40,271
a noble person and a good Christian.

879
00:38:43,717 --> 00:38:45,947
I cannot understand how,

880
00:38:46,018 --> 00:38:49,112
being endowed with such
contradictory characters,

881
00:38:49,188 --> 00:38:51,418
we have lived in such friendship.

882
00:38:53,025 --> 00:38:54,755
Aren't you drinking?

883
00:38:54,829 --> 00:38:57,525
I've nearly finished the bottle.

884
00:38:57,597 --> 00:38:59,088
You haven't touched your glass.

885
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:17,208
What are you thinking about?

886
00:39:17,284 --> 00:39:20,981
I was thinking of the sun which I saw today,

887
00:39:21,052 --> 00:39:24,148
whether I would see it again tomorrow.

888
00:39:24,224 --> 00:39:27,123
You doubtless will, if there is no mist.

889
00:39:27,193 --> 00:39:29,159
I may not live to see tomorrow.

890
00:39:32,831 --> 00:39:35,699
Are you planning a duel?

891
00:39:35,768 --> 00:39:37,760
I could act as your witness.

892
00:39:37,838 --> 00:39:44,539
You are the last man
I would ask for this favour.

893
00:39:44,610 --> 00:39:45,976
Good heavens!

894
00:39:49,248 --> 00:39:52,342
You took up your old squabble
with my brother?

895
00:39:52,418 --> 00:39:55,717
Shall I lose my friend
or my brother in one duel?

896
00:39:55,789 --> 00:39:59,155
I have an ominous feeling...
wait until midnight.

897
00:39:59,226 --> 00:40:01,851
If I die, I will come to warn
you about the penalties

898
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:04,360
a sinner faces after he dies.

899
00:40:08,833 --> 00:40:10,699
I didn't want to see you,

900
00:40:10,771 --> 00:40:13,293
but a voice from heaven ordered me to come.

901
00:41:05,257 --> 00:41:07,690
Were you killed?

902
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:11,592
I was.

903
00:41:11,664 --> 00:41:16,159
Is there a purgatory in the other world?

904
00:41:16,235 --> 00:41:18,204
There is one.

905
00:41:18,271 --> 00:41:21,503
And that's where I am!

906
00:41:40,025 --> 00:41:42,927
Who died?

907
00:41:42,996 --> 00:41:44,690
Tell me, who died?

908
00:41:57,110 --> 00:41:59,168
Toledo fell unconscious.

909
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:08,418
I'm sorry, but my duties are calling me.

910
00:42:08,487 --> 00:42:10,784
At such an interesting point!

911
00:42:10,856 --> 00:42:15,351
Doses of suspense are the sign of a master.

912
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:18,592
All that has made me confused.

913
00:42:18,664 --> 00:42:21,690
I've lost the feeling of where reality ends,

914
00:42:21,766 --> 00:42:25,135
and fantasy takes over.

915
00:42:25,204 --> 00:42:28,869
You meant to say poetry.

916
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,309
I do not know what you are aiming at.

917
00:42:32,378 --> 00:42:34,347
I will tell you something

918
00:42:34,414 --> 00:42:37,246
that is based on the principles of geometry.

919
00:42:37,315 --> 00:42:40,081
Wanting to define an infinite number,

920
00:42:40,152 --> 00:42:44,351
I write a horizontal eight
and divide it by one.

921
00:42:44,422 --> 00:42:47,085
If I want to express infinite smallness,

922
00:42:47,159 --> 00:42:51,789
I write a one and divide it by
the horizontal eight.

923
00:42:51,864 --> 00:42:56,302
All these signs give me no idea
about what I want to express

924
00:42:56,369 --> 00:43:01,329
infinity... greatness...

925
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:05,206
In the cosmos,
infinite smallness is an infinite root

926
00:43:05,277 --> 00:43:08,440
of the smallest part of an atom.

927
00:43:08,514 --> 00:43:14,976
So I am defining infinity,
but without comprehending.

928
00:43:16,722 --> 00:43:22,320
Well, if I do not comprehend
but I can define it,

929
00:43:22,396 --> 00:43:27,628
I am getting near poetry,
which seems to be nearer to life

930
00:43:27,699 --> 00:43:31,362
than we suspect.

931
00:43:31,436 --> 00:43:35,534
Empirical science leads to lack of faith.

932
00:43:35,608 --> 00:43:39,101
Only an uneducated man
who sees a thing every day

933
00:43:39,177 --> 00:43:43,079
thinks he understands it.

934
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:47,177
A true researcher proceeds among riddles.

935
00:43:47,253 --> 00:43:51,418
He errs, but he gets nearer
his goal every day.

936
00:43:54,525 --> 00:43:58,827
Señor Avadoro,
will you finish Toledo's story?

937
00:43:58,898 --> 00:44:02,925
I remember he was disturbed
by a voice from the other world.

938
00:44:03,003 --> 00:44:03,592
Yes.

939
00:44:04,838 --> 00:44:07,829
His tender soul was very sensitive.

940
00:44:10,141 --> 00:44:12,976
So he was in deep despair.

941
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:34,797
What will you do?

942
00:44:34,867 --> 00:44:36,891
I want to rethink my life.

943
00:44:44,677 --> 00:44:49,239
Señor Caballero, let me make one comment.

944
00:44:49,315 --> 00:44:51,612
The voice you heard yesterday

945
00:44:51,684 --> 00:44:54,914
said what you could find in any catechism.

946
00:44:54,985 --> 00:44:58,514
Do not burden oneself with premature worries.

947
00:44:58,592 --> 00:45:05,257
My friend, he who once heard
the voice of the dead,

948
00:45:05,331 --> 00:45:09,199
will surely not spend
much more time among the living.

949
00:46:07,860 --> 00:46:10,918
Farewell, my friend.

950
00:46:30,081 --> 00:46:33,985
Tell the lady everything
without getting into detail.

951
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:03,304
I have chosen you
as I have a delicate problem.

952
00:47:03,382 --> 00:47:05,213
I would be glad to help,

953
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:07,911
but I am afraid to leave my client.

954
00:47:07,985 --> 00:47:10,045
I can substitute for you, it won't be long.

955
00:47:10,121 --> 00:47:11,418
Listen.

956
00:47:20,931 --> 00:47:23,925
I warn you, he is a prattler and a bore.

957
00:47:24,003 --> 00:47:27,335
You can find something
interesting in every story.

958
00:47:30,074 --> 00:47:34,637
You remember the señor with
whom I drank wine at your inn?

959
00:47:34,713 --> 00:47:36,773
He is the husband of a young noblewoman.

960
00:47:36,849 --> 00:47:40,512
Discreetly hand this little jewel
over to her.

961
00:47:59,771 --> 00:48:02,206
Señor Lopez Suarez?

962
00:48:06,344 --> 00:48:09,338
like fortune telling, love has its magic.

963
00:48:09,414 --> 00:48:12,110
This tells me you'll see me again soon.

964
00:48:12,184 --> 00:48:13,208
Maybe.

965
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:52,414
You are kind, but the medicine is awful.

966
00:48:52,489 --> 00:48:57,360
I would give you a more tasty one,
but the medic won't let me.

967
00:48:57,429 --> 00:48:59,021
Sit down.

968
00:48:59,097 --> 00:49:00,621
Sit down, when I tell you to.

969
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:10,440
I have one soft spot
and you will do me a favour.

970
00:49:10,507 --> 00:49:12,873
Take this instrument in your hand...

971
00:49:18,050 --> 00:49:20,677
and now listen carefully.

972
00:49:20,753 --> 00:49:27,748
I am the son of Gaspar Suarez,
the richest merchant in Cádiz.

973
00:49:32,097 --> 00:49:35,998
You're wasting time again on romances.

974
00:49:36,068 --> 00:49:37,592
I'm listening, Daddy.

975
00:49:42,342 --> 00:49:46,072
It's time you departed for Madrid.

976
00:49:46,146 --> 00:49:48,637
You have to get to know the world.

977
00:49:48,713 --> 00:49:52,878
Daddy, I want to get married.

978
00:49:52,952 --> 00:49:56,614
First, pass your examination in life.

979
00:49:56,688 --> 00:50:00,592
These are the rules you have to follow.

980
00:50:00,659 --> 00:50:04,222
I forbid you to get into
discussions with noblemen.

981
00:50:04,295 --> 00:50:09,130
The lords honour us while
actually they just want credit,

982
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:12,795
but cannot repay, understand?

983
00:50:12,871 --> 00:50:15,739
I forbid you to use the title of "Don".

984
00:50:15,806 --> 00:50:18,972
You are Suarez and that's that.

985
00:50:19,043 --> 00:50:23,378
And I also forbid you to use your sword.

986
00:50:23,449 --> 00:50:27,284
The habit brings more discredit than good.

987
00:50:28,588 --> 00:50:33,989
Last but not least, under no circumstances

988
00:50:34,061 --> 00:50:38,724
may you enter into any connections

989
00:50:38,797 --> 00:50:42,324
with the house of the banker, Moro.

990
00:50:42,400 --> 00:50:44,527
Moro.

991
00:50:44,601 --> 00:50:48,539
And I will reveal to you why.

992
00:50:50,309 --> 00:50:54,472
Though I am related to
the greatest bankers in Spain,

993
00:50:54,547 --> 00:50:59,210
seeing how well you are trading
with the Philippines,

994
00:50:59,284 --> 00:51:03,780
I will deposit a million with you
for a limited partnership.

995
00:51:03,856 --> 00:51:05,447
I am honoured.

996
00:51:17,369 --> 00:51:22,601
I'll try to double your deposit
as soon as possible.

997
00:51:22,675 --> 00:51:26,074
You do not need to hurry, señor.

998
00:51:26,146 --> 00:51:28,306
Too bad I didn't hurry.

999
00:51:45,864 --> 00:51:50,891
I am Moro, the royal banker, as you know.

1000
00:51:50,969 --> 00:51:55,338
My relative, Señor Livardez, has passed away.

1001
00:51:55,407 --> 00:52:00,811
In his accounts,
there is your cheque for a million.

1002
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:04,246
Will you please return the capital?

1003
00:52:04,315 --> 00:52:06,342
I have legally taken over his estate.

1004
00:52:06,418 --> 00:52:08,443
The million was invested.

1005
00:52:08,521 --> 00:52:12,547
It will be doubled in the future,
maybe even...

1006
00:52:12,623 --> 00:52:14,717
I am very sorry.

1007
00:52:24,402 --> 00:52:27,302
All right.

1008
00:52:27,373 --> 00:52:30,672
Here is your late relative's share.

1009
00:52:36,447 --> 00:52:39,110
And now listen carefully.

1010
00:52:39,186 --> 00:52:43,349
Years later, my ships returned,
having tripled the fortune,

1011
00:52:43,422 --> 00:52:48,860
so I wrote to the banker Moro
that I had his two million.

1012
00:53:00,905 --> 00:53:05,003
My principal received your letter
and begs to inform you

1013
00:53:05,077 --> 00:53:09,309
that the Livardez capital
was entered into the books.

1014
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:11,976
He will not claim any more

1015
00:53:12,052 --> 00:53:14,449
I owe him two million!

1016
00:53:14,521 --> 00:53:17,751
My principal does not even
want to hear of it.

1017
00:53:17,822 --> 00:53:20,418
This is an insult!

1018
00:53:20,492 --> 00:53:23,427
I do not need his generous donation!

1019
00:53:23,494 --> 00:53:26,396
He is insulting me!

1020
00:53:26,465 --> 00:53:29,364
I began to claim my rights,

1021
00:53:29,436 --> 00:53:33,132
considering my good name
and that of my profession.

1022
00:53:33,204 --> 00:53:35,467
I started proceedings.

1023
00:53:35,541 --> 00:53:39,534
The tribunal of Sevilla
pronounced Moro right.

1024
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:44,311
We are to pay court fees of 600,000 piastres.

1025
00:53:44,382 --> 00:53:46,315
We got no justice.

1026
00:53:46,385 --> 00:53:48,650
Six years wasted.

1027
00:53:48,722 --> 00:53:51,713
And the two million is supposed to be mine?

1028
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:53,949
That's vile!

1029
00:53:54,025 --> 00:53:56,722
You will appeal.

1030
00:53:59,297 --> 00:54:02,755
So you see, my son,
I have good reasons to forbid you

1031
00:54:02,833 --> 00:54:08,204
any contact with the house
of the banker Moro.

1032
00:54:08,739 --> 00:54:09,967
And then?

1033
00:54:10,043 --> 00:54:12,510
I said goodbye and,

1034
00:54:12,579 --> 00:54:15,603
filling my carriage with love stories
I had bought in Cádiz,

1035
00:54:15,681 --> 00:54:18,047
I left for Madrid.

1036
00:54:18,117 --> 00:54:22,349
Pour me some more of this good mixture,
good man.

1037
00:54:28,061 --> 00:54:30,289
I feel my strength returning.

1038
00:54:34,699 --> 00:54:41,195
These sentimental stories
had softened my soul so much

1039
00:54:41,273 --> 00:54:44,572
that arriving here I was madly in love,

1040
00:54:44,641 --> 00:54:50,239
although I didn't know
the object of my desire.

1041
00:55:08,467 --> 00:55:09,934
Oh, sorry.

1042
00:55:24,748 --> 00:55:26,478
Who is that?

1043
00:55:29,155 --> 00:55:31,713
Come on in, señor.

1044
00:56:18,771 --> 00:56:21,831
Señor Don Lopez Suarez.

1045
00:56:21,907 --> 00:56:24,137
I came to pay my respects.

1046
00:56:24,208 --> 00:56:27,646
I am generally known under the name of...

1047
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:36,052
under the name of...

1048
00:56:36,121 --> 00:56:41,581
Don Roque Busqueros,
a family from Old Castile.

1049
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:45,025
My father has forbidden me
to use the title of "Don",

1050
00:56:45,097 --> 00:56:47,896
and to get involved with noblemen.

1051
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:52,902
Señor Don Lopez, my father,
in turn, ordered me

1052
00:56:52,972 --> 00:56:54,963
to give the title of "Don"
to all prominent merchants,

1053
00:56:55,039 --> 00:56:57,474
and to seek their company.

1054
00:57:01,880 --> 00:57:04,041
I also respect my father's will.

1055
00:57:09,155 --> 00:57:13,748
Your attitude and the elegance

1056
00:57:13,824 --> 00:57:18,489
with which you got out of
your carriage impressed me.

1057
00:57:18,563 --> 00:57:20,588
Is it yours, Don Lopez?

1058
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,561
Mine.

1059
00:57:24,637 --> 00:57:26,831
Lucky coincidence!

1060
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:29,931
This is what I passionately collect.

1061
00:57:30,007 --> 00:57:33,373
Here, I'll be glad to oblige.

1062
00:57:33,445 --> 00:57:37,108
A real collector always has copies,

1063
00:57:37,181 --> 00:57:41,677
should one get lost for unknown reasons.

1064
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:47,554
And the third could come in handy,
when the chance arises.

1065
00:57:47,626 --> 00:57:51,927
Don... Roque, I just got out of the carriage.

1066
00:57:51,996 --> 00:57:55,329
I am tired and hungry.

1067
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:56,922
Exactly.

1068
00:58:05,677 --> 00:58:09,168
Well, Don Lopez, it isn't becoming

1069
00:58:09,248 --> 00:58:11,909
that we eat off one plate

1070
00:58:11,985 --> 00:58:17,922
and use the same spoon and fork.

1071
00:58:17,989 --> 00:58:21,119
Hey, boy!
Hey, boy.

1072
00:58:21,193 --> 00:58:23,353
Get another set!

1073
00:58:23,427 --> 00:58:25,954
Hey boy, get another set!

1074
00:58:30,601 --> 00:58:40,168
Busqueros entertained me with
gossip from Madrid, while I was

1075
00:58:40,244 --> 00:58:45,148
impatiently looking forward
to getting back to Buen Retiro.

1076
00:58:45,217 --> 00:58:50,621
This depopulated park is famous
in our romantic stories,

1077
00:58:50,688 --> 00:58:55,126
and I don't even know what was telling me

1078
00:58:55,195 --> 00:58:58,789
I would enter into some
tender relationship there.

1079
00:59:30,427 --> 00:59:34,195
Señora, I probably found
what you are looking for.

1080
00:59:34,266 --> 00:59:37,293
I lost my locket and gold chain.

1081
00:59:37,369 --> 00:59:40,668
Was anything written on it?

1082
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:43,503
You read my name was Inez,

1083
00:59:43,574 --> 00:59:46,940
and that the original
of the portrait is mine.

1084
00:59:47,012 --> 00:59:49,914
May I comment, lovely lady,

1085
00:59:49,981 --> 00:59:53,007
that the finder usually gets a decent prize?

1086
00:59:53,083 --> 00:59:55,449
You're forward for a first meeting.

1087
00:59:55,521 --> 00:59:57,681
Congratulations!

1088
00:59:57,755 --> 01:00:00,418
You've met the son
of Cádiz's richest merchant.

1089
01:00:00,492 --> 01:00:04,757
I did not give any reason
to have strangers talk to me.

1090
01:00:04,829 --> 01:00:07,025
Lopez Suarez.

1091
01:00:07,099 --> 01:00:09,590
Be kind enough to return my locket.

1092
01:00:19,844 --> 01:00:21,708
Begone!

1093
01:00:51,708 --> 01:00:54,110
Señor Don Lopez,

1094
01:00:54,177 --> 01:00:57,670
I've refused twenty invitations
to come and see you.

1095
01:00:57,748 --> 01:01:03,311
Well, you have to admit
I did you a favour yesterday.

1096
01:01:03,387 --> 01:01:06,255
Feigning unwittingness, I told the lady

1097
01:01:06,324 --> 01:01:12,059
you were the son of
one of the richest merchants.

1098
01:01:12,130 --> 01:01:15,896
Though she pretended to be angry,
it was only

1099
01:01:15,967 --> 01:01:22,998
to convince you she was not
at all impressed by wealth.
