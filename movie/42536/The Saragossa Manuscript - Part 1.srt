1
00:00:11,678 --> 00:00:14,579
The Saragossa Manuscript

2
00:03:44,123 --> 00:03:46,683
Forward!
Follow me!

3
00:05:53,453 --> 00:05:55,387
You are a prisoner.

4
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:57,082
No resistance, please.

5
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,820
Can you hear me?

6
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:03,327
Wait a minute, friend,

7
00:06:03,396 --> 00:06:05,796
until I finish admiring these drawings.

8
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,832
What about the enemy?

9
00:06:14,907 --> 00:06:16,932
Carry on the pursuit!

10
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:27,282
Interesting.

11
00:06:27,353 --> 00:06:29,617
Very much so.

12
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,021
Too bad I don't know Spanish.

13
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,994
Look, this is about my grandfather.

14
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,667
"The Count Ollavedez who, at that time,"

15
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,761
"had not yet brought
the settlers to the Sierra..."

16
00:06:45,838 --> 00:06:48,363
Captain!

17
00:06:49,175 --> 00:06:51,837
They're surrounding us.
What shall we do?

18
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,345
Why don't you close the door?
It's drafty!

19
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,012
Where was I?

20
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:04,716
Here, I think.

21
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,259
"...the Sierra Morena,"

22
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:11,990
"a steep range between
Andalusia and La Mancha."

23
00:07:12,064 --> 00:07:15,966
"At that time, it was populated,"

24
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:20,563
"with robbers and gyp"

25
00:07:20,640 --> 00:07:23,234
Thank you, "gypsies..."

26
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:26,244
"and gypsies, of whom it was said,"

27
00:07:26,379 --> 00:07:30,213
"would eat the corpses of killed wanderers."

28
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,326
Will we make it before dark?

29
00:07:41,394 --> 00:07:42,884
Before dark?

30
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,760
Three days aren't enough
to cross these mountains.

31
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:47,629
Where will we sleep?

32
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:49,600
It becomes dark very quickly.

33
00:07:49,669 --> 00:07:52,331
Sometimes you can find
a deserted inn at the roadside,

34
00:07:52,405 --> 00:07:55,602
because infernal ghosts
chased out the innkeepers,

35
00:07:55,675 --> 00:08:00,044
and when evil ghosts...

36
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:02,147
So what?

37
00:08:02,248 --> 00:08:06,810
A traveller who comes here
should be prepared for the very worst.

38
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:08,547
I am not scared of them.

39
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:09,781
I can handle them.

40
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:12,154
Listen to Mosquito!

41
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:15,854
Saddle the mules and follow me, and hurry!

42
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:18,226
Sir, demons rave there

43
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,595
and invisible hands push you into the abyss.

44
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:23,157
The devils have goats' hooves, not feet.

45
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:25,033
Let's go through Extremadura.

46
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:26,401
The sights are prettier there.

47
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:34,245
We'll go straight on and stop here,

48
00:08:34,313 --> 00:08:39,307
at the cork oaks,
where we will have our food.

49
00:08:39,385 --> 00:08:42,650
Then we'll spend the night at Venta Quemada.

50
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:44,656
And the next day,

51
00:08:44,724 --> 00:08:47,887
get supplies and prepare
to cross the mountains.

52
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:54,661
And in three days' time, exhausted but happy,

53
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:57,202
we'll ride triumphantly into Castilla.

54
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,865
That's my plan and nothing
is going to change it!

55
00:09:03,276 --> 00:09:04,800
He'll ruin us.

56
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:11,106
Since King Don Philip V honoured me

57
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,845
with the rank of captain
of the Walloon Guard,

58
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,582
it is my duty to find
the shortest way to Madrid.

59
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,651
My young lord,

60
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:23,286
maybe the king has honoured you
with a captain's rank,

61
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:27,298
but reason has not done
the same for your brains.

62
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,174
It would be good to quench our thirst.

63
00:10:44,243 --> 00:10:46,370
Water isn't good after fruit.

64
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:49,346
Where is the mule attendant?

65
00:10:49,415 --> 00:10:51,815
I don't like all this.

66
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:55,081
He has gone off with all our supplies.

67
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,180
Sir, evil ghosts have
kidnapped poor Mosquito.

68
00:10:58,257 --> 00:10:59,781
He's escaped!

69
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,123
Damned rascal,

70
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:06,062
I didn't like his shrewd eyes
right from the start.

71
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,828
Why didn't I listen to
Brother Jerome de la Trinidad,

72
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:11,165
holy monk and preacher?

73
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:13,797
Mosquito!

74
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:17,274
He said the officers
of the guard were heretics.

75
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,368
Shut up, stupid!

76
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:30,947
I'll catch him and break his bones
if he fled from fear.

77
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,083
Don't leave me alone here, sir.

78
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,320
Then you go.

79
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:40,229
No, sir, I will not go.

80
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:42,893
Well, we'll talk later.

81
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:53,843
Mosquito!

82
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,301
Two foreign ladies who are staying here

83
00:15:08,374 --> 00:15:10,842
would like to invite you to supper.

84
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,879
Will you please follow me, caballero?

85
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:39,358
Señor caballero, thank you

86
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:42,298
for your kind acceptance
of this modest supper.

87
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,768
Appease your hunger, sir.

88
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:49,274
You probably haven't eaten
since early morning.

89
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,401
Are you surprised at our meeting?

90
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:57,882
My name is Emina and
this is my sister, Zibelda.

91
00:16:57,950 --> 00:17:01,579
We live in Tunisia, but we come from Grenada,

92
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:06,147
where our relatives still adhere
to our forefathers' faith.

93
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,693
Our journey is an important secret

94
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,787
which we want to confide to your honesty.

95
00:17:13,298 --> 00:17:16,199
That was what we expected, señor caballero.

96
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:21,569
I took a seat near you to
tell you our family's story.

97
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,164
Listen carefully.

98
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,769
Does this locket contain
a picture of your mistress?

99
00:17:26,845 --> 00:17:29,370
This jewel is a gift from my mother

100
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:32,781
and it contains a fragment
of a genuine relic.

101
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:35,251
Does it frighten you?

102
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:39,086
Only evil ghosts are afraid of relics.

103
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:44,391
We are Muslim,
so don't be surprised at my sister.

104
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:48,058
Too bad our closest relative
follows a strange faith.

105
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,170
Am I your relative?

106
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,900
You are.

107
00:17:55,974 --> 00:17:58,340
Your mother was a Gomelez.

108
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,708
We also belong to that family.

109
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:03,145
I've never heard of it.

110
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:08,414
Aren't you wrong, dear ladies?

111
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,620
No.

112
00:18:13,492 --> 00:18:15,926
I promised to tell you
the story of our ancestors,

113
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:22,024
but I think it would be better
if I start with my own.

114
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:23,500
Sit down.

115
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,108
We were waiting for you.

116
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:36,079
Had you chosen another road out of fear,

117
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,412
we'd have lost respect for you.

118
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:42,181
You are flattering me, Emina,

119
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:45,587
but I never turn off the road I have chosen.

120
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:51,027
But why are you so concerned with my courage?

121
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:53,223
We are concerned about you.

122
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:55,198
Me?

123
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:58,236
Maybe you will feel less
flattered when I tell you

124
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:02,433
that you are the first man we have ever met.

125
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:04,908
My sister speaks the truth.

126
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:07,309
We never had a brother.

127
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:11,008
And locked up in the harem
since we were children,

128
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:15,213
we never had the slightest idea
about your sex.

129
00:19:15,287 --> 00:19:18,984
But nature gave us the inclination to love.

130
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,355
We gave each other our love.

131
00:19:21,426 --> 00:19:24,190
This is beginning to look interesting.

132
00:19:24,263 --> 00:19:28,222
My sister and I love each other dearly.

133
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,133
Seeing this, our mother said,

134
00:19:31,203 --> 00:19:39,372
we would either remain maidens
or marry one man.

135
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:42,936
Her assurance somewhat calmed our anxiety.

136
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:51,787
The head of the family agreed
that we could marry one man,

137
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:55,258
provided he was a Gomelez.

138
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:56,851
Is it...

139
00:19:56,929 --> 00:19:57,918
Is it me?

140
00:19:57,996 --> 00:19:58,792
It is.

141
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,764
This is the idea we liked best.

142
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,426
But my religion, my faith!

143
00:20:03,502 --> 00:20:05,766
Don't you like us, Alfonso?

144
00:20:05,837 --> 00:20:07,327
Aren't we nice?

145
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,566
It's nearly dawn.

146
00:20:11,643 --> 00:20:14,771
Time is too precious
to be wasted on idle talk.

147
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,284
We cannot become your spouses unless

148
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,549
you accept the Prophet's law.

149
00:20:25,991 --> 00:20:29,825
You will be allowed
to see us in your dreams only.

150
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:33,296
But you have to keep our existence secret.

151
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:35,356
Do you agree?

152
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,331
Pass the chalice!

153
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:05,359
But remember your promise.

154
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:17,701
My dear cousin, why aren't you Muslim?

155
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:23,908
How happy I would be, if seeing you...

156
00:21:23,982 --> 00:21:26,450
on Emina's lap,

157
00:21:26,518 --> 00:21:29,146
I too could call my self your wife.

158
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:33,469
Come with me, my son.

159
00:24:36,041 --> 00:24:40,102
Woe to him who, in his wicked inflexibility,

160
00:24:40,178 --> 00:24:44,012
refuses to confess his sins.

161
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:21,217
Do not spend the nights under the skies.

162
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:37,999
And beware of all temptations,
as the Lord has lifted His hand.

163
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:50,946
I will do as you say, Father, but first...

164
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:58,080
my belly requires refreshment.

165
00:25:58,156 --> 00:26:00,852
Think about your soul's salvation

166
00:26:00,926 --> 00:26:04,020
and I'll look after your body's needs.

167
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:10,263
Strange things were happening last night.

168
00:26:10,335 --> 00:26:14,237
Did you stay in the deserted inn
by any chance?

169
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:17,104
I visited Venta Quemada.

170
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,075
But I have my reasons

171
00:26:22,147 --> 00:26:26,777
for being reluctant to explain it to you.

172
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:29,843
Devils are tempters.

173
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:33,254
Beware of Satan and pride, my son!

174
00:26:33,325 --> 00:26:37,284
Yes, yes, beware of Satan.

175
00:26:37,362 --> 00:26:40,923
I am amazed at your courage.

176
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:47,029
Tell me, young man,
who are you and who raised you up?

177
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,699
Do you believe in ghosts?

178
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:51,935
Me? Why should I?

179
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:06,182
have no fear.

180
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:10,455
This one is possessed,
and I am chasing the devil out of him.

181
00:27:10,528 --> 00:27:14,055
Pasheko!

182
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:16,692
In the name of Our Lord,

183
00:27:16,768 --> 00:27:20,761
I order you to drive the goats uphill!

184
00:27:35,053 --> 00:27:39,820
Here is an example of how
the Angel of Darkness

185
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:43,156
is still ruling
this unfortunate neighbourhood.

186
00:27:45,196 --> 00:27:47,756
I am giving him much of my time.

187
00:27:47,832 --> 00:27:50,323
I think I will be able to save him.

188
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:53,462
He's been making great progress lately.

189
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,733
He milks these goats?
Yes.

190
00:28:00,445 --> 00:28:02,879
Can you satisfy my curiosity, my son?

191
00:28:06,051 --> 00:28:09,111
I was asking for details of your life.

192
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,587
You honour me, Father,

193
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,920
and you will know everything.

194
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:19,191
I come from a family who had
more prominent men than wealth.

195
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:24,429
My father, a colonel of the Walloon Guard,

196
00:28:24,502 --> 00:28:28,495
was an extremely kind and
honourable gentleman.

197
00:28:48,793 --> 00:28:51,819
In the name of Van Worden!

198
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:04,300
You'll pay for this, rascal!

199
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:09,342
A horse, bring me a horse!

200
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,814
What are you waiting for, cowards?

201
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:26,097
I have a feeling this is going to end badly.

202
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:50,383
Señor, I request you grant me
a moment to talk.

203
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:53,185
All right.
Privately.

204
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,787
Señor, I do not have
the pleasure of knowing you.

205
00:29:57,862 --> 00:29:59,420
You'll know me in a while.

206
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,599
Señor.

207
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,645
After you.

208
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,480
After you.

209
00:30:59,457 --> 00:31:02,858
Your coach, señor, has outrun my carriage.

210
00:31:02,927 --> 00:31:05,225
There is something offensive in that,

211
00:31:05,296 --> 00:31:07,856
and I would like you to justify it.

212
00:31:07,932 --> 00:31:10,765
Señor, it seems it wasn't
my coachmen who outran yours,

213
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:14,862
but yours who were dragging along
and were left behind.

214
00:31:14,939 --> 00:31:18,340
I admit you are right.

215
00:31:18,409 --> 00:31:23,142
Too bad that you didn't say that
before I drew my sword.

216
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:28,678
Señor, I understand you perfectly well.

217
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:04,822
Excuse me for having taken your time.

218
00:32:04,889 --> 00:32:07,153
Oh, don't mention it.

219
00:32:07,225 --> 00:32:08,624
May I?

220
00:32:08,693 --> 00:32:11,594
But of course, señor.

221
00:32:24,542 --> 00:32:29,570
I'll be getting back to my roast
which may not be quite cold yet.

222
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,267
Water!

223
00:32:52,036 --> 00:32:54,903
Why did he have his coach chopped up?

224
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:56,941
He'd be more comfortable.

225
00:32:57,008 --> 00:33:00,637
After it lost the race,
he couldn't look at it any more

226
00:33:00,712 --> 00:33:01,906
Water!

227
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,880
I would have sold it.

228
00:33:03,948 --> 00:33:08,408
A nobleman like him never sells,
he just destroys.

229
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:12,320
Everything I have for a drop of water.

230
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,119
Did you hear that?

231
00:33:14,192 --> 00:33:17,252
If you had water, you'd be a rich man.

232
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:20,456
He's mad to start all these duels.

233
00:33:20,531 --> 00:33:24,297
If you have a master
who likes collecting wounds,

234
00:33:24,369 --> 00:33:26,894
you have to be ready for anything.

235
00:33:29,574 --> 00:33:32,475
God damn it!

236
00:33:33,711 --> 00:33:36,578
I'd sell my soul for a drop of water.

237
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:45,272
I have invited you all to attend my wedding,

238
00:34:45,349 --> 00:34:49,183
every one with whom I have had
the pleasure of crossing swords

239
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:53,053
at least once and whom, of course,
I haven't killed.

240
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:18,737
You came to rejoice with me.
I need your advice.

241
00:35:18,816 --> 00:35:21,011
Here is a letter from the mayor of Bayón,

242
00:35:21,085 --> 00:35:23,815
asking me to take possession
of my ancestral castle

243
00:35:23,888 --> 00:35:26,982
in the Ardennes.

244
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:29,390
Should I leave the king's service

245
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:32,293
or leave my heritage to its own fate?

246
00:35:32,363 --> 00:35:34,695
If you vote...

247
00:35:37,735 --> 00:35:40,260
I'll do
as you advise.

248
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:49,477
Please hurry, señores,
or the meat will be quite cold.

249
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:54,917
Farewell, my king and lord,
farewell, sunny Spain,

250
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:59,218
and I invite you to a feast
at my castle in the Ardennes.

251
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,554
Who will pay?

252
00:36:01,626 --> 00:36:05,528
This is a great loss!
This is going to ruin me!

253
00:36:18,442 --> 00:36:20,467
Follow me!

254
00:36:45,603 --> 00:36:48,629
Nothing can equal our sunny Spain.

255
00:36:52,443 --> 00:36:54,877
This was a stupid idea.

256
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:58,245
I don't think I'll ever sing

257
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:02,844
a serenade to the most beautiful señorita.

258
00:37:05,122 --> 00:37:06,714
Hush.

259
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:08,850
True, it's not the same.

260
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,687
I don't envy the bride and groom.

261
00:37:16,767 --> 00:37:19,167
Long live the bride and groom!

262
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:29,001
I wish your son a prompt return to Spain.

263
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,880
Señora, our son will be named Alfonso.

264
00:37:35,953 --> 00:37:38,683
Señores, continue your feast.

265
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:42,522
I, a true Spaniard, have to fulfil my duties.

266
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:16,855
Señora, this rain reminds me
of the siege of Lleida,

267
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:21,762
when I stood up to my waist in water.

268
00:38:21,832 --> 00:38:24,494
they were beautiful times.

269
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:27,128
I was famous for my bravery then.

270
00:38:35,946 --> 00:38:40,883
Exactly nine months later, I was born.

271
00:38:40,951 --> 00:38:43,351
You told us a nice story.

272
00:38:43,421 --> 00:38:47,187
It seems your father is a man of honour.

273
00:38:47,258 --> 00:38:49,658
have you inherited this virtue?

274
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:53,857
Boasting is not a feature of
a Walloon Guard officer, Father.

275
00:38:53,931 --> 00:38:56,331
Before you start your own story,

276
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,995
I'll ask Pasheko to bring you
some fresh milk.

277
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:02,266
No, I better start straight away.

278
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:08,006
I was brought up away from home
to learn the ways of a nobleman.

279
00:39:46,751 --> 00:39:49,982
"...and the lid flew open.
I saw a skeleton coming out."

280
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,457
"I drew my sword, but the
skeleton tore off its left hand,"

281
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:58,723
"using it as a weapon,
and fiercely attacked me."

282
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:01,765
"I was defending my self bravely"

283
00:40:01,832 --> 00:40:04,562
"when another skeleton jumped out,"

284
00:40:04,635 --> 00:40:06,728
"snapped off a rib of the first,"

285
00:40:06,804 --> 00:40:09,398
"and struck me with all his might."

286
00:40:09,473 --> 00:40:11,407
Welcome, son!

287
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:29,559
It's been so long, so many ears.

288
00:40:29,627 --> 00:40:31,822
My dearest son!

289
00:40:31,896 --> 00:40:34,888
You didn't forget your holy alphabet, my son?

290
00:40:34,965 --> 00:40:37,365
Or my sophisticated teachings?

291
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:39,403
No, I've been studying hard.

292
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:42,803
Show us then, son.

293
00:40:42,873 --> 00:40:46,468
Very well, excellent.

294
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:50,674
Dear Eureko, leave manly things to men.

295
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:54,548
The time has come
to show you the ultimate stroke.

296
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,781
It's extremely complicated,
but once you've mastered it,

297
00:40:57,855 --> 00:41:02,292
you'll be one of the best fencers.

298
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:03,883
En garde!

299
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:05,394
Dear Eureko!

300
00:41:05,463 --> 00:41:10,526
I fought 130...
Yes, my son, 130 duels.

301
00:41:10,601 --> 00:41:13,195
I'll give you all my experience now.

302
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,567
Allez I!

303
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:28,808
I failed again.

304
00:41:28,886 --> 00:41:31,480
You were the finest fencer.

305
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:35,150
Don't worry, Alfonso will
take over with honour.

306
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,353
Return to your fatherland, son.

307
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:40,124
Spain is the loveliest country in the world.

308
00:41:43,534 --> 00:41:47,766
I'll do my best to help you
become a Walloon Guard captain.

309
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:52,902
Thus I came here, and last night...

310
00:41:55,279 --> 00:42:01,548
Well, dear son, I've become
very interested in your story.

311
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:06,318
I can also see that you received
a good education.

312
00:42:06,390 --> 00:42:11,760
However, as you spent last night
at the Venta Quemada...

313
00:42:14,965 --> 00:42:19,402
What was I saying?

314
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:24,066
Oh, I am afraid you could have
been haunted by two hanged men.

315
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:29,306
I wouldn't like you to have
the same fate as Pasheko.

316
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,348
Don't be afraid, Father.

317
00:42:31,415 --> 00:42:34,213
My mother told me that, in the old days,

318
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,083
you may have come across possessed people,

319
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:39,122
but today they are no more.

320
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:40,588
What?

321
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,286
haven't you seen the awful possessed Pasheko,

322
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:45,521
whose eye the devils have gouged out?

323
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,021
Pasheko!

324
00:42:49,099 --> 00:42:52,796
His story may contribute
to the salvation of your soul.

325
00:43:03,948 --> 00:43:06,883
I will order him to begin.

326
00:43:06,951 --> 00:43:09,545
Pasheko!

327
00:43:09,620 --> 00:43:12,180
In the name of Our Lord,

328
00:43:12,256 --> 00:43:17,319
I order you to tell your story to our guest.

329
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:31,369
I was born in Córdoba.
My father was prosperous.

330
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,535
You may leave that out, Pasheko.

331
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,602
His mother died three years ago,

332
00:43:35,679 --> 00:43:39,137
and his father decided
to marry a young widow.

333
00:43:39,216 --> 00:43:41,684
Camilla de Tormes.

334
00:43:41,752 --> 00:43:43,617
they were wed in Sevilla.

335
00:43:43,687 --> 00:43:48,954
A few days later, my father
returned with his new wife...

336
00:43:49,026 --> 00:43:51,290
and her sister, Inezillia.

337
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:04,329
My dear wife, my lady,
I bought some mules for your coach,

338
00:44:04,408 --> 00:44:10,040
and for you, lovely Inezillia,
a sapphire ring.

339
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:15,950
You are the best husband, señor,
and brother in law.

340
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:20,218
Inezillia is ecstatic, aren't you, Inezillia?

341
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,758
Thank you with all my heart.

342
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:28,458
Do not eat fruit, Inezillia,
you know it is bad for you.

343
00:44:28,532 --> 00:44:32,525
I am glad you are happy.

344
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:37,131
Camilla, we would like to hear your songs,

345
00:44:37,207 --> 00:44:39,038
as we always do after lunch.

346
00:44:39,109 --> 00:44:42,101
Oh yes, Camilla, do sing for us!

347
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:45,342
Come with me, sister, to get the instruments.

348
00:45:04,435 --> 00:45:09,099
I beg your permission, Father,
to marry beautiful Inezillia.

349
00:45:09,173 --> 00:45:13,075
We will go to Madrid and
start a wonderful life there.

350
00:45:13,143 --> 00:45:18,103
Forget it, son.
First of all, it would be

351
00:45:18,182 --> 00:45:22,243
unbecoming for you to be
your father's brother in law.

352
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:28,986
Secondly, church laws ban
such alliances, and thirdly

353
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,256
I love her more than my own life.

354
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:37,232
And thirdly...

355
00:45:37,301 --> 00:45:40,168
I do not want you to marry Inezillia.

356
00:45:51,882 --> 00:45:54,316
Don't worry, Pasheko.

357
00:45:54,384 --> 00:45:57,911
If your father won't allow you
to marry my sister,

358
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:04,985
there are no obstacles at all
to your being her lover.

359
00:46:05,062 --> 00:46:11,900
Señora, Inezillia is an angel of purity,
how could I

360
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:15,200
Leave it to me, Pasheko,

361
00:46:15,272 --> 00:46:18,537
my sister will listen to my request,

362
00:46:18,609 --> 00:46:23,569
which I will pronounce with pain in my heart.

363
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:29,586
Pasheko, Pasheko, who can resist you?

364
00:46:29,653 --> 00:46:32,417
Make it short, Pasheko.

365
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:37,119
Now tell me how soon after
your father set out

366
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:43,258
on the trip to Madrid, taking
his wife and her sister along.

367
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:48,930
The days without Inezillia were unbearable.

368
00:46:49,006 --> 00:46:53,841
I missed her and suffered.

369
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:21,163
Manuela!

370
00:47:36,486 --> 00:47:38,317
In Venta Quemada?

371
00:47:38,388 --> 00:47:40,413
That's where you are to wait for him.

372
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,482
Cruel gangs are roving the Sierra Morena.

373
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:50,398
It's quiet since those two thugs
the Zota brothers, were hanged.

374
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:54,563
Will Inezillia be accompanying my father?

375
00:47:54,638 --> 00:47:56,105
Yes, señor.

376
00:47:57,941 --> 00:47:59,499
No more delay.

377
00:48:03,013 --> 00:48:04,708
Inezillia.

378
00:48:07,284 --> 00:48:09,377
We'll always be together.

379
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,076
Can I eat at your place?

380
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,058
And spend the night?

381
00:48:49,126 --> 00:48:51,993
Señor, by St. Parazito, don't do it!

382
00:48:52,062 --> 00:48:54,223
have you no clean bedclothes?

383
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,766
I am ready even for the king's court.

384
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:58,323
Well?

385
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:01,269
Here, ghosts rave all night.

386
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:02,862
Ghosts?

387
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:05,807
Even we go to the next village at night.

388
00:49:05,876 --> 00:49:09,004
It's scary here, at night.

389
00:49:09,079 --> 00:49:12,571
My friend, we'll sleep with ghosts.

390
00:49:12,649 --> 00:49:14,844
As you wish, señor,

391
00:49:14,918 --> 00:49:18,319
but allow me and my wife
to leave the inn for the night.

392
00:49:20,457 --> 00:49:24,018
I'll keep the ghosts from stealing things.

393
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:27,692
Where are you going?

394
00:49:27,764 --> 00:49:32,997
Señor, don't play around with ghosts.
I'm scared.

395
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:36,335
Then go with them, you weakling.

396
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:42,862
Pasheko, the moment has come.

397
00:50:45,542 --> 00:50:50,536
Your father is asleep and
Inezillia is waiting for you.

398
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,944
Come on, come on, come on.

399
00:51:17,707 --> 00:51:20,403
Everything is going well, Pasheko.

400
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:22,069
Just look.

401
00:51:26,616 --> 00:51:27,844
Indeed.

402
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,909
I'll tell you when the time is right.

403
00:51:54,377 --> 00:51:59,371
Pasheko, Pasheko, We are waiting for you.

404
00:52:09,893 --> 00:52:15,763
Inezillia, do you really desire a lover?

405
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:29,777
You will be lovers but
I will always be with you.

406
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:32,378
Kiss!

407
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:40,519
Hard!

408
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:48,087
You love Inezillia and I love you.

409
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:53,432
She will refuse you nothing,
but remember my condition.

410
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,600
Well, son, what do you think?

411
00:53:32,342 --> 00:53:37,575
I think you would get scared
in such circumstances, too.

412
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:41,977
A nobleman is afraid of nothing.

413
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:47,149
Then let Pasheko continue with his story.

414
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:51,888
I may hear something interesting.

415
00:53:52,729 --> 00:53:55,562
Pasheko!

416
00:53:55,632 --> 00:54:00,535
In the name of God, I order you to continue.

417
00:54:04,541 --> 00:54:07,738
I ran for my life
from right under the gallows,

418
00:54:07,811 --> 00:54:10,803
and roamed far off the road all day.

419
00:54:27,464 --> 00:54:30,865
I know what you want to say.

420
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:34,165
Had I come earlier, there'd be
a feast fit for a king.

421
00:54:34,237 --> 00:54:35,329
Indeed.

422
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,236
Now the ghosts have taken over

423
00:54:37,307 --> 00:54:40,743
And you are spending the night
in the next village.

424
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:45,179
Allow me, señor, to leave you.

425
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,148
Was there a nobleman from Córdoba

426
00:54:47,217 --> 00:54:50,084
and two women yesterday?

427
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:53,919
Try to remember:
A nobleman from Córdoba.

428
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:59,189
My wife left your supper on the stove, señor.

429
00:54:59,262 --> 00:55:01,025
On the stove.

430
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:41,102
Pasheko!

431
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:44,072
Make room for me right near you.

432
00:55:44,140 --> 00:55:46,973
I am trembling with cold.

433
00:55:47,043 --> 00:55:49,307
It's me, your Inezillia.

434
00:55:49,379 --> 00:55:52,177
Begone, Satan!

435
00:55:52,248 --> 00:55:55,115
You are chasing us away?

436
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,382
Come on, sister, we'll light the fireplace.

437
00:57:22,505 --> 00:57:24,405
Well, my son?

438
00:57:29,512 --> 00:57:35,144
I can see you now realise the power of Satan.

439
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:38,779
It is getting late.

440
00:57:38,855 --> 00:57:41,449
I am not offering you a place here.

441
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,823
Pasheko's screams wouldn't
let you close your eyes.

442
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:47,089
Go to the chapel.

443
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:49,495
To the chapel?

444
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,158
To the chapel.

445
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:07,581
But I'll hear him there too.

446
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,641
He has such a terrible yell.

447
00:58:09,719 --> 00:58:13,155
Son, I know what I'm telling you.

448
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,214
Oh yes, to the chapel.

449
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:20,220
You will sleep quietly there.

450
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:39,680
Kneel down at the altar,
confess your sins and repent.

451
00:58:39,749 --> 00:58:41,876
There's still time to prevent evil.

452
00:58:41,951 --> 00:58:45,580
I don't think I have sinned,
unless I did it in my dreams.

453
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,864
Who is there?

454
00:59:00,937 --> 00:59:05,738
We're cold, it is us, your mistresses.

455
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:09,608
Go back to your gallows,
I want to get some sleep!

456
00:59:09,679 --> 00:59:12,944
You sneer at us, because you're in a chapel!

457
00:59:13,016 --> 00:59:15,883
But come join us out in the graveyard.

458
00:59:15,952 --> 00:59:17,681
At your service.

459
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,312
But tomorrow!

460
00:59:49,619 --> 00:59:52,417
I can see you're nervous, my son.

461
00:59:57,160 --> 00:59:59,321
And it's not surprising.

462
01:00:00,730 --> 01:00:05,394
Last night, wicked spirits
were up to terrible mischief.

463
01:00:05,468 --> 01:00:07,129
The goats were bleating.

464
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:12,700
Devils may assume various forms, my son.

465
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:18,445
they somehow stay away from me, Father.

466
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:22,280
I can see you still have faith,
but I'm worried

467
01:00:22,352 --> 01:00:25,014
you won't be able to keep it.

468
01:00:25,088 --> 01:00:27,454
I will, I will.

469
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:33,423
I don't want to keep you any longer.

470
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:37,023
You have a long journey.

471
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,000
By the day after tomorrow,

472
01:00:39,068 --> 01:00:41,127
you'll have crossed the Sierra Morena.

473
01:00:41,204 --> 01:00:44,196
You'll find some supplies by your saddle.

474
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:48,642
What's the shortest way to Madrid?

475
01:00:48,711 --> 01:00:52,203
I have never been to Madrid, my son.

476
01:00:52,281 --> 01:00:56,479
I know, however, you have to go...

477
01:00:56,552 --> 01:01:00,215
that way.

478
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:02,416
Thank you...

479
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:03,925
Father.

480
01:01:10,900 --> 01:01:16,998
But remember, my son,
that God has raised his arm.

481
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,372
Señor Alfonso Van Worden?

482
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:55,206
Yes, captain of the Walloon Guard.

483
01:01:55,278 --> 01:01:56,711
You're under arrest

484
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,906
in the name of the Holy Inquisition.

485
01:01:58,981 --> 01:02:00,642
Señor, give us your sword.

486
01:02:10,660 --> 01:02:15,154
Gentlemen, señores, I'm a nobleman!

487
01:02:15,832 --> 01:02:18,232
What an incredibly noisy sinner.

488
01:02:18,301 --> 01:02:23,068
I hope he'll be as talkative
in front of the Holy Tribunal.

489
