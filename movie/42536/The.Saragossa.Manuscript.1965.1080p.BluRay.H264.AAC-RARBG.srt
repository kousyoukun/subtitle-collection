THE SARAGOSSA MANUSCRIPT

00:00:27,917 --> 00:00:31,124
Written by

3
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:39,082
Featuring

4
00:01:44,875 --> 00:01:48,124
Music

5
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:48,332
Director of photography

6
00:02:48,625 --> 00:02:53,957
Directed by

7
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:59,374
Forward! After me!

8
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:10,374
We take you prisoner!
Don't try to resist.

9
00:06:10,917 --> 00:06:14,207
Hey! Do you hear me?

10
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,416
Just a minute, friend.
I'm admiring these drawings.

11
00:06:25,417 --> 00:06:27,291
What about the enemy?

12
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:29,582
Go after them.

13
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,041
Interesting.

14
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:44,082
It's a pity I don't know Spanish.

15
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,582
Look, it's about my grandfather.

16
00:06:50,542 --> 00:06:58,457
"Count Ollavedez, who had not yet
brought settlers to the Sierra..."

17
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,707
Captain!

18
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,582
We're being surrounded!
What shall we do?

19
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:07,249
Close the door!
It's drafty!

20
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:13,707
Where was I?

21
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,624
Here.

22
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,999
"... to the Sierra Morena.

23
00:07:20,292 --> 00:07:24,874
This steep mountain range
between Andalusia and La Mancha,

24
00:07:25,167 --> 00:07:30,999
was inhabited by robbers and gyp..."

25
00:07:33,375 --> 00:07:37,082
Thank you... gypsies.

26
00:07:37,542 --> 00:07:43,582
"They were said to feed on
corpses of killed travellers".

27
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,541
Will we make it before night?

28
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:58,499
Before night? It'll take three days
to cross these mountains.

29
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,874
Where will we sleep?
It gets dark quickly.

30
00:08:02,167 --> 00:08:06,207
Sometimes you can come
across a roadside inn.

31
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:10,374
It's usually deserted as devilish
ghosts chase the innkeepers out.

32
00:08:10,667 --> 00:08:14,207
- Once evil spirits pick a place...
- Then what?

33
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,624
A traveller who comes here
should be prepared for the worst.

34
00:08:19,917 --> 00:08:22,457
I'm not afraid of ghosts.
I can cope with them.

35
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,499
Sir, listen to Mosquito.

36
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,457
Saddle the mules and follow me.
Hurry!

37
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,957
Sir, don't go.
Demons rave there.

38
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,207
Invisible hands push people
into the precipice.

39
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,499
Devils have goat hooves.

40
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:40,207
- Let's head for Extremadura.
- It has better sights.

41
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,874
We'll go straight ahead.

42
00:08:45,417 --> 00:08:51,374
We'll make a stop at the cork oaks
to eat our provisions.

43
00:08:52,042 --> 00:08:55,166
We'll stay overnight
at Venta Quemada.

44
00:08:55,500 --> 00:09:01,332
The next day we'll stock up
and head for the mountains.

45
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:05,499
After three days,
exhausted but happy,

46
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:09,332
we'll make a triumphant
ride into Castile.

47
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:13,499
That's my plan!
Nothing will change it!

48
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,832
It'll be the end of us.

49
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:21,874
Since King Philip V
honoured me

50
00:09:22,167 --> 00:09:25,166
with the rank of captain
of the Wallonian Guard,

51
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,957
it's my duty to find
the shortest way to Madrid.

52
00:09:30,167 --> 00:09:35,291
Maybe the king did honour you,

53
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:39,541
but your mind lacks reason.

54
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,499
I feel thirsty.

55
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,082
It's bad to drink water
after eating fruit.

56
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:01,124
Where's the mule keeper?

57
00:11:02,292 --> 00:11:07,374
I don't like it.
He ran away with our provisions!

58
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,749
Don't say that. I bet evil spirits
kidnapped poor Mosquito.

59
00:11:11,042 --> 00:11:13,582
He ran away!

60
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,082
Damned thug!

61
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,582
He had these shrewd eyes.

62
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:21,957
Why didn't I listen
to Brother Jerome De La Trinidad,

63
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:23,957
holy monk and preacher?

64
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,457
Mosquito!

65
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:29,874
He said Wallonian Guard officers
were heretics!

66
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:31,874
Shut up, fool!

67
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,624
I'll get him.

68
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,791
I'll break his bones
if he chickened out.

69
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,624
I beg you.
Don't leave me alone here.

70
00:11:46,917 --> 00:11:49,874
- Let's go!
- I can't.

71
00:11:53,167 --> 00:11:55,457
We'll talk later.

72
00:12:01,792 --> 00:12:06,582
Mosquito!

73
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,541
He ran away.

74
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:22,416
Two foreign ladies staying
in this inn invite you to supper.

75
00:15:23,417 --> 00:15:25,707
Follow me, cavalier.

76
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,416
Seńor cavalier.

77
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:54,457
Thank you for being so kind
and sharing our modest supper.

78
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:57,207
Satisfy your hunger.

79
00:16:57,500 --> 00:17:00,207
You probably haven't eaten all day.

80
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,416
Are you surprised to meet us?

81
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:08,666
My name is Emina.
This is my sister Zibelda.

82
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,874
We live in Tunis.
But we come from Grenada,

83
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:17,832
where our relatives secretly
profess the faith of our fathers.

84
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,207
Our journey is
a well-kept secret.

85
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,707
We believe in your honesty
and want to confide it to you.

86
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,916
We expected you.

87
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:35,166
I want to tell you the story
of our family. Listen.

88
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:39,166
Do you carry the image
of your mistress in this locket?

89
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:44,374
It's a gift from my mother
with a piece of genuine relic.

90
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,624
Why are you frightened?

91
00:17:47,917 --> 00:17:51,291
Only evil spirits
are afraid of relics.

92
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,707
We're Muslim.

93
00:17:54,292 --> 00:17:56,832
Don't be surprised
at my sister's reaction.

94
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:01,416
We're sorry that our closest
relative has a different faith.

95
00:18:02,667 --> 00:18:06,332
Me? Your relative?

96
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,041
Yes.

97
00:18:08,417 --> 00:18:10,624
Your mother was a Gomelez.

98
00:18:10,917 --> 00:18:13,082
We come from that family.

99
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,416
I never heard about it.

100
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,207
Aren't you mistaken,
my dear ladies?

101
00:18:22,542 --> 00:18:23,957
No.

102
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:30,707
I promised to tell you
the story of our ancestors.

103
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,499
But I'll start with mine.

104
00:18:34,875 --> 00:18:36,416
Sit down.

105
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,499
We've been waiting for you.

106
00:18:45,792 --> 00:18:48,582
Had you shown fear
and gone a different way,

107
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,582
you'd lose our respect.

108
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:56,582
You flatter me, but I never
deviate from my way.

109
00:18:58,042 --> 00:19:02,707
Why are you so preoccupied
with my courage?

110
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,832
- We're preoccupied with you.
- Me?

111
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,249
You won't be so flattered

112
00:19:10,542 --> 00:19:14,207
when I tell you that you're
the first man we ever met.

113
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,832
My sister speaks the truth.

114
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,582
We never had a brother.

115
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,791
We were locked away
in a seraglio since childhood.

116
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:26,374
We had no idea men existed.

117
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:30,916
But nature endowed us
with the ability to love.

118
00:19:31,792 --> 00:19:35,541
- So we gave each other love.
- How interesting.

119
00:19:36,625 --> 00:19:39,082
We really love each other.

120
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:45,041
Our mother told us that

121
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:51,541
we would either remain maidens
or marry the same man.

122
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:54,207
That made us feel better.

123
00:19:55,375 --> 00:20:03,041
The head of the family gave us
permission to marry one man.

124
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:07,582
As long as he comes
from the Gomelez family.

125
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:10,832
- Is that man me?
- Yes.

126
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:13,082
We like that idea.

127
00:20:13,375 --> 00:20:15,749
But my religion, my faith...

128
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:17,832
- Don't you like us?
- I do.

129
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:21,457
- Aren't we nice to you?
- You are.

130
00:20:21,750 --> 00:20:26,832
It's nearly dawn.
Let's not waste time on idle talk.

131
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,999
We can't be your wives.

132
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:36,749
Unless you accept
the Prophet's law.

133
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:42,082
But you'll be able to see us
in your dreams.

134
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,624
If you keep it a secret
that we exist.

135
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:47,707
Do you agree?

136
00:20:50,125 --> 00:20:52,207
The chalice, please!

137
00:21:15,167 --> 00:21:17,582
Remember what you promised.

138
00:21:25,917 --> 00:21:29,916
My dear cousin,
why aren't you a Muslim?

139
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,332
I'd be so happy to see you...

140
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:42,082
on Emina's bosom
and be your wife.

141
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,707
Follow me, my son.

142
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:55,582
Woe to him whose heart is hard
and refuses to confess his sins.

143
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:32,207
Don't spend the night
under an open sky.

144
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:50,041
Beware of all temptations
for the Lord has raised his hand.

145
00:25:57,875 --> 00:26:03,207
I will do as you say, Father.
But...

146
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:10,041
My belly craves food.

147
00:26:10,375 --> 00:26:13,041
Think how to salvage your soul.

148
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:16,416
I'll take care of
your bodily needs.

149
00:26:19,250 --> 00:26:21,916
Strange things
happened last night.

150
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:26,166
Did you spend the night
at a deserted inn?

151
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,832
I was at Venta Quemada but...

152
00:26:32,417 --> 00:26:36,707
I have my reasons for
not wanting to talk about it.

153
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,791
Devils tempt us.

154
00:26:42,125 --> 00:26:45,041
Beware of Satan's pride.

155
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:48,291
You're right.
Beware of Satan.

156
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:51,707
Your courage amazes me.

157
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:56,124
Who are you, young man?

158
00:26:57,500 --> 00:27:01,332
Who raised you?
Do you believe in ghosts?

159
00:27:01,792 --> 00:27:03,624
Me? No.

160
00:27:15,792 --> 00:27:18,166
Don't be afraid.

161
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:22,541
He's possessed. I'm trying
to get the devil out of him.

162
00:27:23,000 --> 00:27:25,499
Pacheco...

163
00:27:26,292 --> 00:27:28,624
In the name of our Lord

164
00:27:28,917 --> 00:27:33,416
I command you to take
the goats up the mountain.

165
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:51,541
It proves that the angel
of darkness has power

166
00:27:52,042 --> 00:27:54,916
over this unfortunate land.

167
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:01,666
I devote much time to him.
I hope I'll save him.

168
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,291
He's making progress.

169
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:08,166
- He milks the goats?
- Yes.

170
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,332
Satisfy my curiosity, son.

171
00:28:18,125 --> 00:28:20,457
I asked about your life.

172
00:28:22,125 --> 00:28:25,791
It's an honour to me.
I'll tell you everything.

173
00:28:26,125 --> 00:28:30,832
My family abounded in prominent
men rather than in wealth.

174
00:28:31,125 --> 00:28:35,124
My father, a colonel
of the Wallonian Guard,

175
00:28:35,417 --> 00:28:39,707
was a polite
and honourable nobleman.

176
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:04,082
I'm a van Worden!

177
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:15,207
You'll pay for this!

178
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:21,457
A horse!
I want a horse!

179
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,916
What are you waiting for, cowards?

180
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,457
This won't end well.

181
00:29:58,167 --> 00:30:01,207
Seńor,
may I have a word with you?

182
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,749
- Please.
- In private.

183
00:30:06,792 --> 00:30:09,749
Seńor, I don't have the pleasure
of knowing you.

184
00:30:10,042 --> 00:30:11,457
You will soon.

185
00:30:20,042 --> 00:30:21,374
Seńor?

186
00:30:32,375 --> 00:30:33,832
After you.

187
00:31:00,875 --> 00:31:02,249
Please.

188
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:14,291
Your carriage overtook mine.

189
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:19,166
It was an offense.
I want you to explain.

190
00:31:19,500 --> 00:31:23,624
My coachman
didn't overtake yours.

191
00:31:24,167 --> 00:31:26,666
Your coachman dragged behind.

192
00:31:27,542 --> 00:31:29,541
I admit you're right.

193
00:31:30,292 --> 00:31:34,957
It's a pity you didn't say
that before I drew my sword.

194
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:40,332
I understand, seńor.

195
00:32:13,375 --> 00:32:16,707
Excuse me for taking up your time.

196
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:20,624
Don't mention it.
May I?

197
00:32:20,917 --> 00:32:23,082
Of course, seńor.

198
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:40,416
Excuse me,
I hope my roast isn't cold yet.

199
00:33:01,042 --> 00:33:02,332
Water!

200
00:33:03,792 --> 00:33:06,499
Why did he tell us to chop up
his carriage?

201
00:33:06,792 --> 00:33:08,124
He'd be more comfortable now.

202
00:33:08,875 --> 00:33:12,166
He couldn't look at it
after that incident.

203
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,707
- Water!
- I'd sell it.

204
00:33:15,375 --> 00:33:19,416
Noblemen like him don't sell
things, they destroy them.

205
00:33:20,167 --> 00:33:23,707
I'd give my wealth
for a drop of water.

206
00:33:24,042 --> 00:33:28,291
Did you hear that?
You'd be rich if you had water.

207
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:31,832
He's crazy to start those duels.

208
00:33:32,125 --> 00:33:35,874
If your master
likes to collect wounds,

209
00:33:36,167 --> 00:33:38,332
be ready for anything.

210
00:33:41,375 --> 00:33:43,999
Damn it!

211
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:48,124
I'd give my soul to the devil
for a drop of water.

212
00:34:54,125 --> 00:34:56,916
I invited you seńores
to my wedding.

213
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:00,457
Those with whom
I crossed swords with,

214
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:03,791
but didn't get to kill.

215
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:30,249
You came to rejoice with me,
now I need your advice.

216
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:32,374
Here's a letter
from the mayor of Bouyon.

217
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:38,457
He summons me to take over the castle
of my ancestors in the Ardennes.

218
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:43,749
Should I leave the king's service
or abandon my heritage?

219
00:35:44,042 --> 00:35:45,416
Take a vote.

220
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,666
I'll do as you say.

221
00:35:56,625 --> 00:36:00,916
Hurry, seńores.
The meat is getting cold.

222
00:36:01,250 --> 00:36:03,291
Farewell, my king.

223
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:06,291
Farewell, sunny Spain.

224
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:10,124
I invite you all to a feast
in my castle in the Ardennes.

225
00:36:10,875 --> 00:36:12,791
Who'll pay me?

226
00:36:13,125 --> 00:36:17,457
What a loss. It'll ruin me.

227
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:31,666
Follow me!

228
00:36:39,917 --> 00:36:41,749
Follow the newlyweds!

229
00:36:57,250 --> 00:37:00,374
There's no place
like our sunny Spain.

230
00:37:06,375 --> 00:37:08,249
It was a stupid idea.

231
00:37:09,167 --> 00:37:14,541
I'll never sing a serenade
again to a beautiful seńorita.

232
00:37:16,625 --> 00:37:17,832
Quiet.

233
00:37:18,125 --> 00:37:20,499
True. It's not the same.

234
00:37:23,917 --> 00:37:26,332
I don't envy the newlyweds.

235
00:37:28,292 --> 00:37:30,457
Long live the newlyweds!

236
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:40,124
May your son
return quickly to Spain.

237
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,249
We shall name our son Alfonse.

238
00:37:47,625 --> 00:37:50,207
Rejoice and enjoy the feast.

239
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,291
As a true Spaniard
I have to fulfill my duty to the end.

240
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:56,249
Yes!

241
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,624
This rain reminds me
of the siege of Lleida.

242
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,957
For three weeks I stood
waist-deep in water.

243
00:38:33,542 --> 00:38:38,749
Those were the times!
I was known for my bravery.

244
00:38:47,667 --> 00:38:51,874
I was born nine months later.

245
00:38:52,625 --> 00:38:54,749
That was quite a story.

246
00:38:55,042 --> 00:38:57,957
Your father is a man of honour.

247
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:01,082
Did you inherit this virtue?

248
00:39:01,375 --> 00:39:05,291
Boasting does not befit
a Wallonian Guard officer.

249
00:39:05,625 --> 00:39:08,249
Before you begin
to tell me about yourself,

250
00:39:08,542 --> 00:39:11,624
I'll ask Pacheco to bring you
some fresh milk.

251
00:39:11,917 --> 00:39:13,916
No. I'll start right away.

252
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:19,541
I was raised away from home
to learn the ways of a nobleman.

253
00:39:57,875 --> 00:40:01,499
"...the lid flew open and I saw
a skeleton climbing out.

254
00:40:01,792 --> 00:40:05,957
I drew my sword.
The skeleton tore off its left hand

255
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:10,374
and used it as a weapon
to attack me fiercely.

256
00:40:10,667 --> 00:40:13,082
I defended myself bravely.

257
00:40:13,375 --> 00:40:16,041
Suddenly
another skeleton jumped out.

258
00:40:16,375 --> 00:40:19,374
It pulled out a rib
from the first one

259
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,082
and hit me on the head".

260
00:40:21,375 --> 00:40:23,249
Welcome, my son.

261
00:40:36,375 --> 00:40:38,916
It's been so long.

262
00:40:41,167 --> 00:40:42,957
My darling boy.

263
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,416
I hope you haven't forgotten
the holy alphabet, son.

264
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:51,332
- Or my teachings.
- I've been a good student.

265
00:40:51,667 --> 00:40:53,541
Show us.

266
00:40:54,917 --> 00:40:57,541
Excellent.

267
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:01,749
My dear Uracca,
leave men's things to men.

268
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,916
Son, I want to show you
a master thrust.

269
00:41:06,250 --> 00:41:07,874
It's very difficult.

270
00:41:08,167 --> 00:41:12,874
But once you master it,
you'll be the best swordsman.

271
00:41:13,917 --> 00:41:15,207
En garde!

272
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:21,749
My dear Uracca, I fought
one hundred and thirty duels.

273
00:41:22,042 --> 00:41:24,624
I'll share my experience with you.

274
00:41:24,917 --> 00:41:26,207
Allez!

275
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:39,832
I failed again.

276
00:41:40,125 --> 00:41:42,749
You were a great swordsman.

277
00:41:43,042 --> 00:41:46,166
Alfonse will take your place.

278
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:48,874
Son, go back to your homeland.

279
00:41:49,167 --> 00:41:52,999
Spain is the most wonderful
country in the world.

280
00:41:55,250 --> 00:42:00,249
I'll see to it that you become
a Wallonian Guard captain.

281
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:04,124
So I came here and last night...

282
00:42:06,625 --> 00:42:07,832
Yes.

283
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:12,374
My son,
your story was captivating.

284
00:42:13,292 --> 00:42:17,124
I see you received
a good education.

285
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:23,624
But since you spent your last night
at Venta Quemada...

286
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:28,249
What was I saying?

287
00:42:31,042 --> 00:42:34,999
I wonder if you were haunted
by two hanged men.

288
00:42:35,625 --> 00:42:40,582
I don't want you to share
the same fate as Pacheco.

289
00:42:40,875 --> 00:42:42,416
I'm not afraid, Father.

290
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:47,666
My mother told me
about possessed people.

291
00:42:48,750 --> 00:42:50,457
But you can't find
them nowadays.

292
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:51,832
What?

293
00:42:52,125 --> 00:42:57,249
What about this poor creature?
The devils plucked his eye out.

294
00:42:58,167 --> 00:42:59,582
Pacheco!

295
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:03,999
His story may help you
salvage your soul.

296
00:43:15,500 --> 00:43:17,874
I'll tell him to begin.

297
00:43:18,667 --> 00:43:24,082
Pacheco, in the name of our Lord,

298
00:43:24,375 --> 00:43:28,957
tell your story to our dear guest.

299
00:43:38,667 --> 00:43:40,749
I was born in Cordoba.

300
00:43:41,125 --> 00:43:44,499
- My father was wealthy.
- You can skip that.

301
00:43:44,792 --> 00:43:46,957
His mother died three years ago.

302
00:43:47,250 --> 00:43:50,457
His father decided to marry
a young widow.

303
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,291
Camilla de Tormes.

304
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:54,999
They wed in Seville.

305
00:43:55,292 --> 00:43:59,624
A few days later my father
came home with his new wife.

306
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,166
And her sister Inezilia.

307
00:44:08,375 --> 00:44:11,541
My dear wife, my lady,

308
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:15,124
I bought mules for your carriage.

309
00:44:15,875 --> 00:44:20,749
And for you, fair Inezilia,
I bought a sapphire ring.

310
00:44:21,625 --> 00:44:27,082
You're the best husband
and brother-in-law.

311
00:44:27,375 --> 00:44:31,499
Inezilia is very happy,
aren't you, dear?

312
00:44:31,792 --> 00:44:33,957
Thank you with all my heart.

313
00:44:34,250 --> 00:44:39,416
Don't eat fruit, Inezilia.
It's bad for you.

314
00:44:39,917 --> 00:44:42,957
I'm glad you're happy.

315
00:44:44,125 --> 00:44:50,082
Camilla, why don't you
sing to us after dinner?

316
00:44:50,375 --> 00:44:52,291
Yes! Please do!

317
00:44:53,542 --> 00:44:56,916
Come, sister.
Let's get the instruments.

318
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:20,041
I beg you, father.
Allow me marry fair Inezilia.

319
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:24,374
We'll go to Madrid
and have a wonderful life there.

320
00:45:24,667 --> 00:45:26,707
Forget it, son.

321
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:32,749
First, it's not appropriate to be
your father's brother-in-law.

322
00:45:33,875 --> 00:45:38,832
Second, the church does not
allow such marriages.

323
00:45:39,750 --> 00:45:43,166
- Third...
- I love her more than anything!

324
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:45,832
Third, I won't have it!

325
00:45:48,875 --> 00:45:51,291
You won't marry Inezilia.

326
00:46:03,500 --> 00:46:05,707
Don't be upset, Pacheco.

327
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:09,374
If your father won't allow you
to marry my sister,

328
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:12,999
you can be her lover.

329
00:46:16,375 --> 00:46:22,666
Inezilia is an angel of purity.
How could I?

330
00:46:23,542 --> 00:46:29,166
Leave it to me, Pacheco.
My sister will hear my request.

331
00:46:30,125 --> 00:46:33,832
I'll do it with a heavy heart.

332
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,166
Pacheco...

333
00:46:38,375 --> 00:46:41,041
Who can resist you?

334
00:46:41,375 --> 00:46:43,124
Keep it short.

335
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:49,791
Tell us how your father
went on a trip to Madrid,

336
00:46:50,125 --> 00:46:53,374
taking his wife
and her sister with him.

337
00:46:54,750 --> 00:46:58,874
Every day without Inezilia
was unbearable.

338
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:04,791
I missed her and suffered.

339
00:47:31,125 --> 00:47:32,582
Manuela!

340
00:47:47,875 --> 00:47:51,541
- Venta Quemada?
- You'll wait for him there.

341
00:47:51,875 --> 00:47:54,916
But there are brutal gangs
prowling in the Sierra Morena.

342
00:47:55,250 --> 00:47:58,249
It's quiet now that the Zoto
brothers have been hanged,

343
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,416
two most horrible thugs.

344
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:05,791
Will Inezilia accompany
my father?

345
00:48:06,125 --> 00:48:07,499
Yes, sir.

346
00:48:09,292 --> 00:48:11,041
I'll be on my way.

347
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,041
Inezilia...

348
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:19,791
We'll never part again.

349
00:48:53,500 --> 00:48:55,916
Is there food and drink here?

350
00:48:58,750 --> 00:49:03,082
- Can I stay overnight?
- Sir, I beg you. Don't do it!

351
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:05,291
You have no clean bed linen?

352
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:09,374
- I can serve the royalty.
- So what's the problem?

353
00:49:09,667 --> 00:49:13,957
- Ghosts roam here at night.
- Ghosts?

354
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:16,832
We spend the nights
at a village nearby.

355
00:49:17,125 --> 00:49:18,624
It's scary here.

356
00:49:20,375 --> 00:49:23,541
We'll sleep with the ghosts.

357
00:49:23,875 --> 00:49:26,207
As you wish, sir.

358
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:30,374
But my wife and I will not spend
the night here.

359
00:49:31,750 --> 00:49:35,624
I'll make sure the ghosts
don't steal anything.

360
00:49:37,292 --> 00:49:38,707
Where are you going?

361
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,832
Sir, don't fool with ghosts.
I'm scared.

362
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:47,291
Get out of here!

363
00:50:51,750 --> 00:50:53,791
It's time, Pacheco.

364
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:01,166
Your father is asleep.
Inezilia is waiting.

365
00:51:05,917 --> 00:51:08,249
Come.

366
00:51:28,750 --> 00:51:32,499
Everything is going well.
Look.

367
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,707
You're right.

368
00:51:39,000 --> 00:51:41,791
I'll give you a sign
when to come in.

369
00:52:05,292 --> 00:52:07,999
Pacheco!

370
00:52:08,292 --> 00:52:10,541
We're waiting for you.

371
00:52:21,167 --> 00:52:26,874
Inezilia, do you really
desire a lover?

372
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:41,082
You two will be lovers,
but I'll always be with you.

373
00:52:42,250 --> 00:52:43,666
Kiss her.

374
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,624
Passionately.

375
00:52:53,750 --> 00:52:57,916
You love Inezilia
and I love you.

376
00:52:59,042 --> 00:53:04,999
She'll give you what you want.
But remember my condition.

377
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:41,457
What do you say, my son?

378
00:53:43,375 --> 00:53:48,666
I think you would be scared
in that situation.

379
00:53:50,125 --> 00:53:52,499
A nobleman knows no fear.

380
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:57,666
I'll tell Pacheco to go on.

381
00:53:58,625 --> 00:54:02,124
I hope it gets more interesting.

382
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:11,582
Pacheco, in the name of our Lord,
continue your story.

383
00:54:15,625 --> 00:54:18,499
Half dead, I ran from the gallows.

384
00:54:18,792 --> 00:54:21,666
I wandered around all day.

385
00:54:39,125 --> 00:54:41,791
I know what you want to say.

386
00:54:42,125 --> 00:54:45,499
If I came earlier,
I'd get a feast fit for a king.

387
00:54:45,792 --> 00:54:47,832
Exactly.
There are ghosts here.

388
00:54:48,125 --> 00:54:51,832
And you spend the nights
at a village nearby.

389
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:55,332
Pardon me, sir.
I have to leave you.

390
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:01,124
Was there a nobleman from Cordoba
with two women here last night?

391
00:55:01,417 --> 00:55:04,124
Well?
A nobleman from Cordoba.

392
00:55:05,125 --> 00:55:09,207
My wife left some supper
for you over the hearth.

393
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:11,916
Over the hearth.

394
00:55:48,875 --> 00:55:51,416
Pacheco!

395
00:55:51,750 --> 00:55:54,874
Let me get closer to you.
I'm trembling from cold.

396
00:55:55,167 --> 00:55:58,207
It's me, your Inezilia!

397
00:55:59,792 --> 00:56:02,874
Go away, Satan!

398
00:56:03,250 --> 00:56:05,541
You're throwing us out?

399
00:56:05,875 --> 00:56:09,624
Come, sister.
Let's light a fire.

400
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:35,582
What do you say, my son?

401
00:57:40,750 --> 00:57:45,957
I see you finally realize
how powerful Satan is.

402
00:57:47,542 --> 00:57:49,082
It's getting late.

403
00:57:49,792 --> 00:57:52,457
I won't offer you a place
to sleep here.

404
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:55,457
Pacheco's screams
would keep you awake.

405
00:57:55,750 --> 00:57:57,416
Go to the chapel.

406
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:01,916
- The chapel?
- Yes.

407
00:58:12,667 --> 00:58:16,541
But I'll hear him there.

408
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:22,957
- His screams are so shrill.
- I know what I'm saying.

409
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,457
The chapel.

410
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:31,124
You'll sleep peacefully.

411
00:58:45,125 --> 00:58:50,249
Kneel at the altar,
confess your sins and repent.

412
00:58:50,542 --> 00:58:52,582
It's not too late to ward off evil.

413
00:58:52,875 --> 00:58:56,916
I don't think I've sinned.
In my dreams, perhaps.

414
00:59:10,417 --> 00:59:11,541
Who's here?

415
00:59:11,875 --> 00:59:15,416
We're cold!
It's us, your mistresses!

416
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:20,291
Go back to your gallows.
I want to sleep.

417
00:59:20,625 --> 00:59:23,082
You scoff us
because you're in a chapel.

418
00:59:23,375 --> 00:59:28,166
- Join us in the graveyard!
- I'll oblige you.

419
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:29,957
Tomorrow.

420
01:00:00,542 --> 01:00:03,041
You're edgy, my son.

421
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,957
I'm not surprised.

422
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:16,041
Last night evil spirits
were up to no good.

423
01:00:16,375 --> 01:00:17,957
The goats were bleating.

424
01:00:19,875 --> 01:00:23,874
Devils like to take
all kinds of forms.

425
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:28,416
They keep away from me.

426
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:31,749
I see you still have faith.

427
01:00:32,375 --> 01:00:37,749
- But will you persist in it?
- I will.

428
01:00:41,167 --> 01:00:46,874
I won't keep you here.
You have a long way to go.

429
01:00:47,917 --> 01:00:51,416
In two days you'll cross
the Sierra Morena.

430
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:54,916
I put some provisions
by your saddle.

431
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:58,041
What's the shortest way to Madrid?

432
01:00:59,917 --> 01:01:02,749
I've never been to Madrid.

433
01:01:03,042 --> 01:01:08,166
But I know it's... that way.

434
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:14,041
Thank you, Father.

435
01:01:21,875 --> 01:01:26,707
Remember!
God has raised his hand!

436
01:02:02,500 --> 01:02:05,791
- Seńor Alfonse van Worden?
- Captain of the Wallonian Guard.

437
01:02:06,125 --> 01:02:09,332
I arrest you in the name
of the Holy Inquisition.

438
01:02:09,625 --> 01:02:11,249
Your sword!

439
01:02:21,250 --> 01:02:25,666
I'm a nobleman!

440
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:28,624
What a noisy sinner.

441
01:02:28,917 --> 01:02:33,041
I hope he's just as talkative
before the Holy Tribunal.

442
01:02:33,375 --> 01:02:34,332
Amen.

443
01:02:34,625 --> 01:02:36,499
I'm going to Madrid!

444
01:03:10,792 --> 01:03:17,499
We let the wrongdoer
accuse himself.

445
01:03:18,500 --> 01:03:22,749
This kind of confession,
though it may seem forced,

446
01:03:23,042 --> 01:03:24,999
has its advantages.

447
01:03:25,417 --> 01:03:29,916
Especially when the wrongdoer
names his collaborators.

448
01:03:42,250 --> 01:03:45,499
Do you know
two African princesses?

449
01:03:48,625 --> 01:03:51,874
It won't do you any good
to keep silent.

450
01:03:53,125 --> 01:03:57,999
I guess I'll have to help you.

451
01:03:59,417 --> 01:04:02,999
Let's see how much you can take.

452
01:04:12,250 --> 01:04:14,749
Are you going to faint?

453
01:04:15,917 --> 01:04:21,041
Smelling salts will make you
conscious again.

454
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,291
Let's carry on.

455
01:04:25,625 --> 01:04:28,624
- Alfonse!
- What is this?

456
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:32,124
You're saved!

457
01:04:32,417 --> 01:04:34,999
Seńor Zoto has come
to your rescue!

458
01:04:38,250 --> 01:04:39,832
Dear Alfonse!

459
01:04:40,125 --> 01:04:41,499
Alfonse!

460
01:04:43,042 --> 01:04:45,666
You've been so brave.

461
01:04:46,125 --> 01:04:48,291
There's no time for kisses.

462
01:04:48,625 --> 01:04:52,041
We have to leave by the time
the guards get here.

463
01:04:52,375 --> 01:04:54,707
This is Seńor Zoto.

464
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:59,541
Seńor Alfonse, allow me
to introduce my brothers.

465
01:05:00,167 --> 01:05:01,457
Chico.

466
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:06,207
Moma and Chico.

467
01:05:06,667 --> 01:05:10,916
How come, Zoto?
Your brothers were hanged.

468
01:05:11,292 --> 01:05:13,707
You heard right.

469
01:05:14,125 --> 01:05:17,332
But you can see
for yourself they're fine.

470
01:05:17,917 --> 01:05:20,124
I saw them myself!

471
01:05:20,875 --> 01:05:26,374
You saw two shepherds
hanging to pacify local people.

472
01:05:31,625 --> 01:05:34,416
What? Don't mention it.
We have great horses.

473
01:05:34,750 --> 01:05:37,082
I'm glad you feel better.

474
01:05:40,917 --> 01:05:43,499
May happiness be with you.

475
01:05:43,792 --> 01:05:45,749
They're surrounding us!

476
01:05:47,125 --> 01:05:50,791
Chico! Cover us!
Let's mount our horses!

477
01:05:55,542 --> 01:05:57,166
Where's my sword?

478
01:06:04,500 --> 01:06:06,166
Careful!

479
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:09,374
Hit harder!

480
01:07:23,625 --> 01:07:25,874
Kiss me.

481
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:36,082
It's my turn now.

482
01:07:36,875 --> 01:07:39,416
I'm so happy!

483
01:07:40,125 --> 01:07:42,957
Are you pleased we're here,
cousin?

484
01:07:45,667 --> 01:07:47,249
Cousin...

485
01:07:48,250 --> 01:07:50,374
This locket is horrible.

486
01:07:53,667 --> 01:07:56,957
It prevents us from loving you
more passionately.

487
01:08:47,625 --> 01:08:49,791
Are you happy, cousin?

488
01:08:51,167 --> 01:08:52,416
Yes.

489
01:08:53,750 --> 01:08:56,707
But I must admit that

490
01:08:57,000 --> 01:09:01,582
I'm not pleased with the way
our night together ended.

491
01:09:01,875 --> 01:09:04,374
We had our pleasures.

492
01:09:05,042 --> 01:09:07,332
But it wasn't so pleasant
in the morning.

493
01:09:07,625 --> 01:09:09,874
Let's forget it.

494
01:09:11,625 --> 01:09:13,666
It's plaited from our hair.

495
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,249
This talisman will make you
remember us.

496
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:21,541
A talisman?

497
01:09:21,875 --> 01:09:26,457
They say you can love only
one woman. Wrong.

498
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:29,624
I love you two the same way.

499
01:09:30,042 --> 01:09:32,916
You're both in my heart.

500
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:37,707
- Accept our faith.
- You'll ascend the throne in Tunis.

501
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,749
Seraglios, gardens, fountains.

502
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:46,582
Let's not talk about kingdoms
flooded by sunshine.

503
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:49,791
We're in an abyss
on the edge of hell.

504
01:09:54,375 --> 01:10:01,957
How dare you be in the company
of Gomelez women?

505
01:10:03,250 --> 01:10:06,249
You're doomed, cousin.

506
01:10:06,667 --> 01:10:08,291
Forgive us!

507
01:10:08,625 --> 01:10:12,082
You'll be killed like
a coward with this axe,

508
01:10:12,375 --> 01:10:16,124
and your corpse will be hung
next to the Zoto brothers

509
01:10:16,417 --> 01:10:19,999
at the mercy of vultures
and evil spirits, or...

510
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:21,624
But the Zoto brothers...

511
01:10:22,125 --> 01:10:27,166
Or you'll drink
the potion from this chalice.

512
01:10:28,125 --> 01:10:29,582
In one gulp!

513
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:46,166
Father, wouldn't you do the same
in the name of honour?

514
01:11:41,875 --> 01:11:44,457
What a horrible misunderstanding.

515
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:49,582
Evil spirits take so many forms,
it's really confusing.

516
01:11:49,875 --> 01:11:52,999
Seńor, you're here?
You're too young for a kabbalist.

517
01:11:53,292 --> 01:11:56,291
But you have a rope
around your neck.

518
01:11:57,917 --> 01:12:00,541
Don't worry.
I know you're brave.

519
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:03,082
However, you lack experience.

520
01:12:05,875 --> 01:12:07,499
Your name is Alfonse.

521
01:12:08,667 --> 01:12:10,624
Your mother is a Gomelez.

522
01:12:10,917 --> 01:12:13,832
You're captain of
the Wallonian Guard.

523
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:19,374
Let's go from this awful place.
We'll decide what to do next.

524
01:12:19,667 --> 01:12:22,249
My name is Alfonse van Worden.

525
01:12:23,500 --> 01:12:24,874
I know that.

526
01:12:26,125 --> 01:12:27,916
I see you're weak.

527
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:31,666
I have this wonderful potion.
It will make you strong.

528
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:33,124
No.

529
01:12:34,125 --> 01:12:36,207
No more potions.

530
01:12:41,042 --> 01:12:43,957
- Where are you heading, sir?
- Madrid.

531
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:49,082
Good. We'll stop at a place
where I left a hearty meal.

532
01:12:50,292 --> 01:12:52,582
I said hearty, not wonderful.

533
01:12:54,417 --> 01:12:56,082
Now listen.

534
01:12:56,375 --> 01:13:00,291
Ancient books contain
Chaldean wisdom.

535
01:13:00,625 --> 01:13:05,166
While the verses of Shir Hashirim
are pure beautiful poetry.

536
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:09,499
In Hebrew every letter is a number,
every word a wise combination.

537
01:13:09,792 --> 01:13:11,832
Every sentence is a formula.

538
01:13:12,125 --> 01:13:15,582
If you pronounce it with proper
exhalation and accent,

539
01:13:15,875 --> 01:13:18,707
you can move mountains
and drain rivers.

540
01:13:19,500 --> 01:13:22,624
Adonai created the world...

541
01:13:27,375 --> 01:13:30,374
This is where somebody
played a joke on me last night.

542
01:13:30,667 --> 01:13:32,041
Let's go in.

543
01:13:35,167 --> 01:13:39,499
- My horse! It's unbelievable.
- And mine is here.

544
01:13:42,792 --> 01:13:44,207
I don't understand.

545
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,624
A horse follows his master.

546
01:13:49,125 --> 01:13:55,291
It's lucky that devils
don't need food.

547
01:14:34,292 --> 01:14:35,791
Good, isn't it?

548
01:14:37,000 --> 01:14:38,332
Good what?

549
01:14:38,625 --> 01:14:42,707
I'm just asking.
I'm glad I can satisfy your hunger.

550
01:14:44,875 --> 01:14:46,207
What is this?

551
01:14:49,750 --> 01:14:51,457
Is it yours?

552
01:14:55,125 --> 01:14:58,457
So you spent the night
in this inn as well.

553
01:14:58,750 --> 01:15:01,957
I did. But I'm not going
to talk about it.

554
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,624
It was a wonderful night.

555
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,124
- In spite of everything.
- In spite of what?

556
01:15:11,542 --> 01:15:14,041
- I won't say. I gave my word.
- To whom?

557
01:15:14,375 --> 01:15:17,749
Two beautiful women.
Don't ask.

558
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:23,916
Let's go.

559
01:15:24,792 --> 01:15:26,874
It's a long way to Madrid.

560
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:32,332
Do you know the shortest way?

561
01:15:32,625 --> 01:15:34,624
Yes. It's that way.

562
01:15:34,917 --> 01:15:38,249
That's where
the Inquisition captured me.

563
01:15:38,917 --> 01:15:42,416
You're right.
Let's avoid their ambush.

564
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,582
Are there other paths?

565
01:15:52,917 --> 01:15:55,041
Kabbalists always find the way.

566
01:15:55,375 --> 01:15:58,957
We'll go around
and get on the trail to Madrid.

567
01:16:22,625 --> 01:16:27,999
The books of Sefer Zohar explain
the depth of the ten elements

568
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:30,249
forming the unity of taste.

569
01:16:30,542 --> 01:16:34,249
Thus we can define the powers
ruling the pandemonistic world.

570
01:16:34,542 --> 01:16:37,291
Do you have to keep using
incomprehensible words?

571
01:16:37,625 --> 01:16:39,416
It makes the journey
more interesting.

572
01:16:39,750 --> 01:16:42,166
There are all kinds of demons,

573
01:16:42,500 --> 01:16:48,249
among which we can find
Hungarian and Polish zombies...

574
01:17:21,375 --> 01:17:22,832
Help!

575
01:17:28,167 --> 01:17:30,457
I arrest you in the name
of the Holy Inquisition.

576
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:32,207
Your sword!

577
01:17:33,625 --> 01:17:36,457
Alfonse van Worden, don't resist!

578
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:40,416
I am Don Pedro Velasquez.
Are you crazy?

579
01:17:40,750 --> 01:17:42,166
Indeed.

580
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,166
It's not him. Who is it?

581
01:17:54,625 --> 01:17:58,916
Don Pedro. He looked similar.
What are you doing here?

582
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:01,374
Anybody can use the roads.

583
01:18:02,625 --> 01:18:03,957
Bandits!

584
01:18:04,875 --> 01:18:07,791
There is no road here.
Go on your way!

585
01:18:08,125 --> 01:18:10,791
That man must have taken
another path.

586
01:18:13,375 --> 01:18:15,791
What if he went back
to Venta Quemada?

587
01:18:16,542 --> 01:18:18,707
I heard he was coming here.

588
01:18:19,000 --> 01:18:21,832
You're not eager
to apologize, are you?

589
01:18:22,125 --> 01:18:23,541
Get out of here!

590
01:18:23,875 --> 01:18:27,832
In that case I apologize to you,
honourable seńores.

591
01:18:35,667 --> 01:18:36,999
A thorn.

592
01:18:37,875 --> 01:18:39,832
I can't take it out.

593
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,582
Bad luck.

594
01:19:08,167 --> 01:19:10,249
There's no place to hide.

595
01:19:11,125 --> 01:19:13,291
Just in case, of course.

596
01:19:26,500 --> 01:19:29,332
- Seńor Alfonse van Worden?
- Yes.

597
01:19:29,792 --> 01:19:33,916
Don't go that way. Some impolite
thugs are waiting for you.

598
01:19:34,250 --> 01:19:35,749
- The Inquisition?
- Yes.

599
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:38,666
I'm really surprised.
The Inquisition here?

600
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,499
They didn't realize you weren't
Alfonse van Worden?

601
01:19:41,792 --> 01:19:46,416
Obviously. They attacked me.
It's logical, isn't it?

602
01:19:46,750 --> 01:19:47,957
Unbelievable.

603
01:19:50,625 --> 01:19:51,791
What now?

604
01:19:52,125 --> 01:19:55,874
You'll go to my castle.
It's just a few miles away.

605
01:19:56,167 --> 01:19:59,999
You have a castle nearby?
You didn't mention it.

606
01:20:00,292 --> 01:20:03,249
He must be a modest man.

607
01:20:03,542 --> 01:20:04,832
What if they find me?

608
01:20:05,125 --> 01:20:07,582
They can't enter it.
We'll take the shortest way.

609
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:12,832
Can I avail of your hospitality?
I'll have a safe night.

610
01:20:13,125 --> 01:20:17,207
I know seńor kabbalist.
He never refuses shelter.

611
01:20:17,500 --> 01:20:19,499
- Of course.
- Thank you.

612
01:20:19,792 --> 01:20:23,666
I'll have time to think about
what happened to me.

613
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,041
Thinking about it can drive
an inexperienced person insane.

614
01:20:27,500 --> 01:20:32,291
The human mind can take
in anything, if used properly.

615
01:20:45,292 --> 01:20:52,582
END OF PART ONE

616
01:20:56,625 --> 01:21:04,416
THE SARAGOSSA MANUSCRIPT
PART TWO

617
01:21:45,042 --> 01:21:47,499
Enrico, the master is back.

618
01:21:47,792 --> 01:21:50,332
- What happened?
- I don't know.

619
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:56,707
You deserve a rest
after a long journey.

620
01:21:57,000 --> 01:21:59,166
You'll be safe here.

621
01:21:59,792 --> 01:22:02,249
My house is at your disposal.

622
01:22:02,542 --> 01:22:05,707
- The 15th century.
- I see you're an expert.

623
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:08,832
Curiosity distinguishes
humans from animals.

624
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:11,499
I observe, listen
and make conclusions.

625
01:22:11,792 --> 01:22:18,499
I'm glad I met you.
I enjoy your company.

626
01:22:18,792 --> 01:22:23,916
Good company works wonders.
It beats wealth or black magic.

627
01:22:24,292 --> 01:22:26,749
This is no place to talk.

628
01:22:27,042 --> 01:22:30,166
Please come inside.
Enrico, show the way.

629
01:22:47,750 --> 01:22:49,499
I expected you in three days.

630
01:22:49,792 --> 01:22:52,041
Unforeseen circumstances
and complications arose.

631
01:22:52,375 --> 01:22:53,624
It all got out of hand.

632
01:22:53,917 --> 01:22:56,624
- What now?
- I don't know.

633
01:22:57,250 --> 01:23:00,541
We must keep him here at all cost.
I'll wait for instructions.

634
01:23:00,875 --> 01:23:02,291
Who's the other man?

635
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:09,749
Be careful. Don't ask questions.
Go make yourself beautiful.

636
01:23:10,042 --> 01:23:11,624
You could have warned me.

637
01:23:11,917 --> 01:23:14,499
Don't nag, my dear.
I couldn't.

638
01:23:16,750 --> 01:23:21,874
I get the impression
it's the work of evil spirits.

639
01:23:22,417 --> 01:23:25,041
I'd rather blame people.

640
01:23:25,625 --> 01:23:30,624
Maybe somebody wants
you to go through all this.

641
01:23:30,917 --> 01:23:37,957
I'm much obliged. I feel you'll
help me solve this riddle.

642
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:41,791
I like this place.
It's peaceful and quiet.

643
01:23:42,125 --> 01:23:44,624
Think about it, seńor.

644
01:23:54,375 --> 01:23:56,957
Do you have everything you need?

645
01:23:59,625 --> 01:24:03,874
- I don't know how to thank you.
- It's nothing. Please feel at home.

646
01:24:04,167 --> 01:24:06,207
Thank you. I feel fine here.

647
01:24:06,500 --> 01:24:08,249
I really do.

648
01:24:09,625 --> 01:24:12,624
- I did some thinking.
- And?

649
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,791
It'll be best for me to get to Madrid
as soon as possible.

650
01:24:19,500 --> 01:24:24,082
Maybe I can make it at night.

651
01:24:25,542 --> 01:24:28,499
The Inquisition
is guarding all roads.

652
01:24:33,125 --> 01:24:36,749
Maybe Seńor Velasquez
will give me some advice.

653
01:24:37,042 --> 01:24:38,541
He's a skeptic.

654
01:24:39,500 --> 01:24:42,124
- What shall I do?
- Wait.

655
01:24:57,542 --> 01:24:59,582
Have a look at my books.

656
01:24:59,875 --> 01:25:04,457
You'll find all the wisdom
of the world on these shelves.

657
01:25:09,250 --> 01:25:12,041
I recommend Spanish writings.

658
01:26:54,292 --> 01:26:56,999
Don Pedro, I found the answer.

659
01:26:57,542 --> 01:26:59,374
Have some wine, it's late.

660
01:26:59,667 --> 01:27:03,291
Maybe it's the last time
we'll light our vigil lamps.

661
01:27:03,625 --> 01:27:06,624
Come, I want to
show you something.

662
01:27:07,375 --> 01:27:11,166
If you feel sad,
drink some good wine.

663
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:16,916
Soon we'll all rest
in eternal night.

664
01:27:17,250 --> 01:27:20,874
How can you be so reckless?
If he had read this to the end,

665
01:27:21,167 --> 01:27:25,666
the events which would follow
would be totally meaningless.

666
01:27:27,875 --> 01:27:29,957
Luckily I came in time.

667
01:27:49,750 --> 01:27:53,166
Strange things are
happening here, seńor.

668
01:27:55,125 --> 01:27:57,332
I saw it with my own eyes!

669
01:27:58,250 --> 01:28:01,291
I held it in my hands.

670
01:28:03,000 --> 01:28:05,999
It's the work of evil spirits.

671
01:28:08,792 --> 01:28:13,457
I understand that your mind
is rebelling against phenomena,

672
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:16,957
which have no explanation
in the structure of matter.

673
01:28:17,250 --> 01:28:21,249
But... try to explain.

674
01:28:28,042 --> 01:28:30,332
What are you looking for?

675
01:28:31,625 --> 01:28:33,916
There was a book here.

676
01:28:34,250 --> 01:28:36,207
I saw the gallows.

677
01:28:36,500 --> 01:28:38,082
Where is it?

678
01:28:38,375 --> 01:28:41,874
Here? I've never seen
a book like that.

679
01:28:49,167 --> 01:28:53,707
- Is it the demons again?
- They can be irritating.

680
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:57,874
Unfortunately the world
is full of them.

681
01:28:58,167 --> 01:29:01,749
Kabbalist incantations can stop
them from doing bad things.

682
01:29:02,042 --> 01:29:03,374
It's absolute nonsense.

683
01:29:03,667 --> 01:29:07,791
- You don't believe in Kabbalah?
- No.

684
01:29:08,125 --> 01:29:09,916
What if I have proof?

685
01:29:10,542 --> 01:29:16,332
- I'd have to prove it myself.
- Go on.

686
01:29:17,000 --> 01:29:20,624
This is no place
for philosophical disputes.

687
01:29:31,125 --> 01:29:35,374
I'm so glad to see you, brother.
When did you get back?

688
01:29:35,667 --> 01:29:38,999
This is Alfonse van Worden,
captain of the guard.

689
01:29:39,292 --> 01:29:41,582
Captain, my sister Rebecca.

690
01:29:44,542 --> 01:29:46,624
Don Pedro Velasquez.

691
01:29:46,917 --> 01:29:49,666
- Madam.
- Welcome.

692
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:54,207
I'm glad I convinced you about
the power of the supernatural.

693
01:29:54,500 --> 01:29:55,832
Of course.

694
01:30:01,792 --> 01:30:07,124
Seńor Alfonse, please tell me
what you think about

695
01:30:07,417 --> 01:30:11,332
everything that happened
to you since you came here.

696
01:30:14,375 --> 01:30:16,416
I don't know what to say.

697
01:30:16,750 --> 01:30:21,624
I was put to sleep with a potion
and taken to the gallows.

698
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:26,541
You were at the gallows
of the Zoto brothers?

699
01:30:27,667 --> 01:30:29,707
You saw them hanging?

700
01:30:31,625 --> 01:30:35,249
Do they have a habit
of freeing themselves?

701
01:30:35,542 --> 01:30:38,166
Yes. Usually at night.

702
01:30:43,500 --> 01:30:48,457
Your palm reads that you are
possessed by love for demons.

703
01:30:50,375 --> 01:30:52,916
You have no fear of people.

704
01:30:53,250 --> 01:30:55,291
I'm not afraid of anybody.

705
01:30:58,000 --> 01:30:59,999
I'm afraid for you.

706
01:31:21,917 --> 01:31:24,166
I'm so happy they're here.

707
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:29,874
We'll rejoice and have fun.

708
01:31:31,667 --> 01:31:35,457
I'm sorry, I have different plans.

709
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:43,499
Whatever it is, you can spend
some time in our company.

710
01:31:57,792 --> 01:32:01,207
Why is your brother greeting
a gypsy so warmly?

711
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:02,707
A gypsy?

712
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:06,624
You'll soon see
what kind of gypsy he is.

713
01:32:13,125 --> 01:32:15,082
Welcome, Seńor Alfonse.

714
01:32:15,375 --> 01:32:17,416
How do you know who I am?

715
01:32:17,750 --> 01:32:20,749
Our camp moves
from one place to another.

716
01:32:21,042 --> 01:32:26,041
My daughters are fortune-tellers.
Their eyes and ears are open.

717
01:32:34,667 --> 01:32:37,166
An enchanted place.

718
01:32:37,625 --> 01:32:40,374
The people of Sierra Morena
are afraid to come near it.

719
01:32:40,667 --> 01:32:43,457
It's not in my interest
to tell them they're wrong.

720
01:32:43,750 --> 01:32:47,916
This way most of my retinue
stays outside the castle.

721
01:32:48,375 --> 01:32:49,707
Seńor Avadoro,

722
01:32:50,000 --> 01:32:55,249
I bet you have encountered many
adventures in your wandering life.

723
01:32:57,875 --> 01:32:59,166
That's true.

724
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:02,749
Tells us a story
and Seńor Velasquez will teach us

725
01:33:03,042 --> 01:33:06,124
how to experience poetry
without the help of ghosts.

726
01:33:06,417 --> 01:33:08,082
I don't succumb to ghosts.

727
01:33:08,375 --> 01:33:11,499
But I'm beginning to fear
the magical power...

728
01:33:11,792 --> 01:33:13,041
... of you, madam.

729
01:33:13,875 --> 01:33:21,541
I believe that the story of love
is the same all over the world.

730
01:33:28,042 --> 01:33:32,666
I think you'll enjoy hearing
about my youthful adventures.

731
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:36,416
Some are amazing.

732
01:33:36,792 --> 01:33:39,041
I could even say miraculous.

733
01:33:42,250 --> 01:33:47,249
Every time I go back to those
distant times of my life,

734
01:33:49,875 --> 01:33:54,999
I hear the turmoil
of passion and storms.

735
01:34:30,042 --> 01:34:33,999
You look smarter than others.
I have a delicate matter.

736
01:34:34,292 --> 01:34:35,499
Follow me.

737
01:34:50,292 --> 01:34:52,707
I'm a young woman's lover.

738
01:34:53,000 --> 01:34:57,749
I think it's hard for her
to remain faithful.

739
01:34:58,042 --> 01:35:02,541
If you see a woman whose dress
suits this piece of fabric,

740
01:35:02,875 --> 01:35:06,332
watch if she goes to church
or elsewhere.

741
01:35:07,500 --> 01:35:08,874
Here.

742
01:35:10,375 --> 01:35:14,624
- You'll get another one later.
- You're her husband, right?

743
01:35:14,917 --> 01:35:18,332
I'm paying you to discover
infidelity, not who I am.

744
01:35:18,625 --> 01:35:21,249
Keep your eyes wide open.
They're calling for vespers.

745
01:35:21,542 --> 01:35:24,457
- I'll be waiting at the inn.
- The Inn of Lovers?

746
01:35:24,750 --> 01:35:25,999
Yes.

747
01:36:06,917 --> 01:36:10,041
- What are you doing?
- Your beauty blinded me.

748
01:36:10,375 --> 01:36:12,832
You're being suspected of infidelity.

749
01:36:13,125 --> 01:36:14,416
Follow me.

750
01:36:16,417 --> 01:36:18,791
Give this to cavalier Toledo.

751
01:36:32,750 --> 01:36:34,624
My noble cavalier?

752
01:36:35,625 --> 01:36:39,957
It's against my conscience
to take money from both parties.

753
01:37:37,625 --> 01:37:39,499
What's my destiny?

754
01:37:40,917 --> 01:37:44,291
We'll get married under
a big chestnut tree.

755
01:37:44,625 --> 01:37:48,624
Nature will hear our vows,
soft twilight will bless us.

756
01:37:51,667 --> 01:37:56,874
I lost cavalier Toledo's address.
He invited me to a feast.

757
01:37:57,167 --> 01:37:59,166
Across the square.

758
01:38:00,250 --> 01:38:02,916
- Until we meet again.
- Who knows?

759
01:39:38,042 --> 01:39:39,416
Seńor Toledo?

760
01:39:40,292 --> 01:39:43,707
A lady asked me
to give this to you.

761
01:39:44,917 --> 01:39:47,666
I appreciate your wit, my friend...

762
01:39:49,125 --> 01:39:50,582
and honour.

763
01:40:01,000 --> 01:40:03,916
Do you want to be
one of my servants?

764
01:40:04,250 --> 01:40:06,791
I can't.
I was born a nobleman.

765
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:12,499
I took on the role of a beggar
as it doesn't dim my nobility.

766
01:40:13,250 --> 01:40:16,124
An answer worthy of a Spaniard.

767
01:40:16,417 --> 01:40:17,499
Cheers.

768
01:40:22,792 --> 01:40:25,457
Human life is so fragile.

769
01:40:27,750 --> 01:40:29,916
Why the gloomy thoughts?

770
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,916
I'm a sinner.

771
01:40:50,375 --> 01:40:53,624
I used to leave
one mistress for another.

772
01:40:53,917 --> 01:40:57,874
But I thought
I was wasting too much time.

773
01:40:58,167 --> 01:41:02,291
So I'd start a new affair before
breaking off the last one,

774
01:41:02,625 --> 01:41:04,416
and plan a next one.

775
01:41:05,042 --> 01:41:09,457
Spanish women
have an urgency about them.

776
01:41:09,917 --> 01:41:11,624
I swore love to each of them.

777
01:41:11,917 --> 01:41:15,041
Punishment for breaking
an oath is severe.

778
01:41:16,167 --> 01:41:18,249
In the other world.

779
01:41:23,917 --> 01:41:28,249
My friend Aquillar from Malta
paid me a visit yesterday.

780
01:41:30,000 --> 01:41:35,791
A nobleman, a good Christian.

781
01:41:39,000 --> 01:41:46,374
How is it possible that we could
be friends being so different?

782
01:41:48,042 --> 01:41:49,832
You're not drinking?

783
01:41:50,125 --> 01:41:54,541
I finished a bottle
and you hardly touched your glass.

784
01:42:10,667 --> 01:42:12,499
What are you thinking about?

785
01:42:12,792 --> 01:42:15,041
The sun I saw today.

786
01:42:16,292 --> 01:42:18,999
I was wondering whether
I'll see it tomorrow.

787
01:42:19,292 --> 01:42:21,999
Sure. If it's not misty.

788
01:42:22,292 --> 01:42:24,749
I may not live to see tomorrow.

789
01:42:27,875 --> 01:42:30,374
Are you planning a duel?

790
01:42:30,875 --> 01:42:38,082
- I can be your witness.
- I couldn't ask you to do that.

791
01:42:39,625 --> 01:42:41,541
Good heavens!

792
01:42:44,167 --> 01:42:47,207
You took up an old feud
with my brother?

793
01:42:47,500 --> 01:42:50,832
You mean I'll lose my friend
or my brother in one duel?

794
01:42:51,125 --> 01:42:54,124
I have a bad feeling.
Wait until midnight.

795
01:42:54,417 --> 01:43:00,332
If I die, I'll come and warn you
what punishment awaits sinners.

796
01:43:03,917 --> 01:43:08,499
I didn't want to see you,
but I heard a voice from heaven.

797
01:43:12,167 --> 01:43:13,749
No.

798
01:44:00,125 --> 01:44:02,374
Are you gone?

799
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:04,707
Yes!

800
01:44:06,875 --> 01:44:11,207
Is there purgatory
in the other world?

801
01:44:11,500 --> 01:44:13,082
Yes!

802
01:44:13,375 --> 01:44:16,416
That's where I am!

803
01:44:35,042 --> 01:44:36,624
Who died?

804
01:44:38,250 --> 01:44:40,332
Tell me who died!

805
01:44:52,250 --> 01:44:54,332
Toledo fell unconscious.

806
01:45:00,500 --> 01:45:03,082
Excuse me, duty calls.

807
01:45:03,500 --> 01:45:05,749
What a moment to stop.

808
01:45:06,042 --> 01:45:10,124
Only real masters know
how to mount suspense.

809
01:45:10,625 --> 01:45:12,874
I'm confused.

810
01:45:14,042 --> 01:45:19,082
I don't know where reality ends
and fantasy begins.

811
01:45:20,250 --> 01:45:22,957
You mean poetry?

812
01:45:23,875 --> 01:45:26,499
I don't know what you mean.

813
01:45:27,375 --> 01:45:32,207
I'll tell you something that is
based on geometry principles.

814
01:45:32,500 --> 01:45:35,166
If I want to define
infinite greatness,

815
01:45:35,500 --> 01:45:38,541
I write a horizontal eight
and divide it by one.

816
01:45:39,417 --> 01:45:42,082
If I want to mark
infinite smallness,

817
01:45:42,375 --> 01:45:46,291
I write one
and divide it by that eight.

818
01:45:46,792 --> 01:45:53,582
But these signs tell me nothing
about what I want to express.

819
01:45:53,875 --> 01:45:57,124
Infinite greatness is cosmos.

820
01:45:57,417 --> 01:46:03,124
Infinite smallness is infinite root
of the smallest part of an atom.

821
01:46:03,417 --> 01:46:10,457
So I mark infinity,
but I don't comprehend it.

822
01:46:11,542 --> 01:46:16,291
If I don't comprehend it,
but I can mark it,

823
01:46:17,292 --> 01:46:19,791
I'm getting close to poetry.

824
01:46:20,167 --> 01:46:25,416
It seems to be closer to life
than we assume.

825
01:46:26,292 --> 01:46:30,124
And faith? Empirical science
contributes to disbelief.

826
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:35,749
Only an ignorant man thinks
he understands what he sees.

827
01:46:36,042 --> 01:46:40,999
A true scholar has to solve
many riddles.

828
01:46:42,167 --> 01:46:46,957
He goes astray, but he gets
nearer to his goal every day.

829
01:46:49,625 --> 01:46:53,541
Seńor Avadoro was telling us
the story of cavalier Toledo.

830
01:46:53,875 --> 01:46:57,749
I remember he was disturbed
by a voice from the other world.

831
01:46:58,042 --> 01:46:59,291
Yes.

832
01:46:59,750 --> 01:47:03,249
His sensitive soul
was stirred by emotions.

833
01:47:04,917 --> 01:47:07,749
He fell into despair.

834
01:47:28,375 --> 01:47:32,457
- What are you doing?
- I want to rethink my life.

835
01:47:39,417 --> 01:47:43,041
Seńor cavalier,
allow me to say something.

836
01:47:44,250 --> 01:47:49,249
The voice you heard yesterday
only said what is in catechism.

837
01:47:49,917 --> 01:47:52,874
There is no need to worry.

838
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:58,582
My friend, one who hears
the voice of the dead,

839
01:48:00,250 --> 01:48:03,999
will not remain among
the living for very long.

840
01:49:02,625 --> 01:49:05,749
Farewell, my friend.

841
01:49:25,042 --> 01:49:28,707
Tell that lady everything
without going into details.

842
01:49:55,167 --> 01:49:57,332
You'll help me.
I have a delicate matter.

843
01:49:58,292 --> 01:50:02,499
I would be glad to help,
but I can't leave my client.

844
01:50:02,792 --> 01:50:04,957
I'll take care of him.
It won't take long.

845
01:50:05,250 --> 01:50:06,332
Listen.

846
01:50:15,667 --> 01:50:18,582
I warn you,
he's a windbag and a bore.

847
01:50:18,875 --> 01:50:22,541
There is something
interesting in every story.

848
01:50:24,917 --> 01:50:29,332
You remember that seńor
I had wine with at your inn?

849
01:50:29,625 --> 01:50:32,207
He's the husband
of a young noblewoman.

850
01:50:32,500 --> 01:50:35,457
Give her this little jewel.
Be discreet.

851
01:50:54,542 --> 01:50:56,332
Seńor Lopez Soarez?

852
01:51:01,292 --> 01:51:04,166
Love has its magic
just like fortune-telling.

853
01:51:04,500 --> 01:51:06,999
Something tells me
you'll see me again.

854
01:51:07,292 --> 01:51:08,457
Who knows?

855
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:47,041
You're kind, my good man.
But the medicine is awful.

856
01:51:47,417 --> 01:51:51,874
I'd give you something tasty,
but the medic insisted.

857
01:51:52,375 --> 01:51:55,332
Sit down. Come on.

858
01:51:59,375 --> 01:52:01,957
I have a certain weakness.

859
01:52:02,250 --> 01:52:06,374
Do me a favour
and take that instrument.

860
01:52:12,875 --> 01:52:14,499
Now listen.

861
01:52:15,625 --> 01:52:19,916
I am the only son
of Gaspar Soarez,

862
01:52:20,375 --> 01:52:22,166
the richest merchant in Cadiz.

863
01:52:27,042 --> 01:52:29,666
Wasting your time on
love stories again?

864
01:52:30,917 --> 01:52:32,499
Yes, daddy?

865
01:52:37,125 --> 01:52:40,124
It's time you went to Madrid.

866
01:52:41,000 --> 01:52:43,457
To get out into the world.

867
01:52:43,750 --> 01:52:46,457
Daddy, I want to get married.

868
01:52:47,792 --> 01:52:50,624
First you have to pass
an exam in life.

869
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:54,291
You must obey these rules.

870
01:52:55,125 --> 01:52:58,916
Don't get into any conversation
with noblemen.

871
01:52:59,125 --> 01:53:05,207
They grace us with their presence
just to get a loan they can't repay.

872
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:06,791
You understand?

873
01:53:07,917 --> 01:53:10,499
I forbid you to use
the title of ‘'Don".

874
01:53:10,792 --> 01:53:13,207
Your are Soarez, that's it.

875
01:53:13,625 --> 01:53:17,374
You are not allowed
to use the sword.

876
01:53:18,167 --> 01:53:22,207
It brings more shame than pride.

877
01:53:23,250 --> 01:53:27,374
Last but not least.

878
01:53:28,875 --> 01:53:34,332
You are not allowed to get into
any kind of relationship

879
01:53:34,625 --> 01:53:37,082
with the family of banker Moro.

880
01:53:37,375 --> 01:53:38,582
Moro?

881
01:53:39,542 --> 01:53:43,124
Now I'll tell you why.

882
01:53:44,667 --> 01:53:48,916
I am related with
the biggest bankers in Spain.

883
01:53:49,250 --> 01:53:53,791
But I see you're doing good
business with the Philippines.

884
01:53:54,125 --> 01:53:58,166
I will deposit one million
with you as a limited partner.

885
01:53:58,500 --> 01:54:00,166
I am honoured.

886
01:54:12,250 --> 01:54:17,166
I'll try to double your deposit
as soon as possible.

887
01:54:17,500 --> 01:54:19,666
There's no hurry.

888
01:54:20,875 --> 01:54:22,291
It's a pity I didn't hurry.

889
01:54:40,542 --> 01:54:44,332
My name is Moro,
the royal banker.

890
01:54:45,042 --> 01:54:49,457
My relative, Seńor Levardez,
has passed away.

891
01:54:49,750 --> 01:54:54,582
I found a cheque you wrote
for one million.

892
01:54:55,542 --> 01:55:00,666
I want you to return that money.
I am his legal beneficiary.

893
01:55:01,000 --> 01:55:02,916
I invested that million.

894
01:55:03,250 --> 01:55:07,124
I will double it
in the future or even...

895
01:55:07,417 --> 01:55:09,207
I'm very sorry.

896
01:55:18,917 --> 01:55:20,207
All right.

897
01:55:22,292 --> 01:55:25,374
Here is your late
relative's deposit.

898
01:55:31,125 --> 01:55:32,957
Now listen carefully.

899
01:55:33,875 --> 01:55:37,707
Two years later my ships returned.
I tripled that money.

900
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:43,707
I wrote a letter to banker Moro
saying I had two million of his.

901
01:55:55,625 --> 01:55:57,916
My superior received your letter.

902
01:55:58,250 --> 01:56:03,791
He informs you that the Levardez
capital was entered into the books.

903
01:56:04,125 --> 01:56:06,541
He has no further claims.

904
01:56:06,875 --> 01:56:08,999
I owe him two million!

905
01:56:09,292 --> 01:56:11,791
My superior won't hear it.

906
01:56:12,417 --> 01:56:13,749
It's an insult!

907
01:56:15,125 --> 01:56:17,707
I don't need his generous gift!

908
01:56:18,000 --> 01:56:20,499
Moro is insulting me!

909
01:56:21,042 --> 01:56:23,249
I began to claim my rights.

910
01:56:24,000 --> 01:56:27,124
For the sake of my good name
and reputation.

911
01:56:27,875 --> 01:56:29,541
I went to court.

912
01:56:30,125 --> 01:56:33,999
The tribunal of Seville
ruled in favour of Moro.

913
01:56:34,292 --> 01:56:38,791
We have to pay six hundred
thousand piastres in court fees.

914
01:56:39,125 --> 01:56:40,874
We didn't find justice.

915
01:56:41,167 --> 01:56:43,166
We wasted six years.

916
01:56:43,500 --> 01:56:47,624
Those two million are mine?
It's deplorable!

917
01:56:48,625 --> 01:56:51,249
You will appeal!

918
01:56:53,875 --> 01:56:57,499
Now you see I have good
reasons to forbid you

919
01:56:57,792 --> 01:57:02,707
any contact with the family
of banker Moro.

920
01:57:03,375 --> 01:57:04,624
What happened next?

921
01:57:04,917 --> 01:57:07,166
I said goodbye to my father.

922
01:57:07,500 --> 01:57:12,374
I took my love stories bought
in Cadiz and left for Madrid.

923
01:57:12,667 --> 01:57:17,457
Can I have more of that mixture,
my good man?

924
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:25,041
It makes me feel stronger.

925
01:57:29,042 --> 01:57:34,499
Those sentimental stories
made my heart melt.

926
01:57:35,875 --> 01:57:40,332
When I came here I felt
I was ready for love,

927
01:57:40,625 --> 01:57:44,916
even though I did not meet
the object of my affection yet.

928
01:57:56,292 --> 01:57:58,416
Cavalier, over here!

929
01:58:02,917 --> 01:58:04,249
Excuse me.

930
01:58:19,250 --> 01:58:20,666
Who is that?

931
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:26,541
Put the chest over there.
Come in.

932
01:58:30,500 --> 01:58:33,041
Allow me, seńor.

933
01:58:43,250 --> 01:58:45,332
Go away!

934
01:59:13,375 --> 01:59:16,041
Seńor Don Lopez Soarez.

935
01:59:16,375 --> 01:59:18,457
I came to pay my respects.

936
01:59:18,750 --> 01:59:23,416
I am generally known
under the name of...

937
01:59:27,125 --> 01:59:33,749
under the name of...
Don Roque Busqueros,

938
01:59:34,125 --> 01:59:35,916
a family from Old Castile.

939
01:59:36,250 --> 01:59:39,374
My father forbade me to use
the title of '‘Don".

940
01:59:39,667 --> 01:59:41,916
And I'm not allowed
to associate with noblemen.

941
01:59:42,250 --> 01:59:43,791
Seńor Don Lopez!

942
01:59:44,125 --> 01:59:47,749
My father told me to address
noble merchants as '‘Dons"

943
01:59:48,042 --> 01:59:51,707
and to seek their company.

944
01:59:56,250 --> 01:59:58,791
I respect my father's will.

945
02:00:03,542 --> 02:00:07,999
I was impressed by
your posture and elegance

946
02:00:08,292 --> 02:00:11,707
when you got out
of the carriage.

947
02:00:12,750 --> 02:00:14,832
Is this yours, Don Lopez?

948
02:00:17,250 --> 02:00:18,624
Yes.

949
02:00:19,250 --> 02:00:23,374
Great. I collect coins.

950
02:00:24,625 --> 02:00:26,499
Here. Take one.

951
02:00:28,042 --> 02:00:31,624
A collector always has two pieces,

952
02:00:32,125 --> 02:00:35,582
in case one gets lost.

953
02:00:36,250 --> 02:00:40,791
And a third one for exchange.

954
02:00:42,417 --> 02:00:45,957
Don Roque, I just arrived.

955
02:00:46,250 --> 02:00:49,124
I'm tired and hungry.

956
02:00:49,917 --> 02:00:51,332
Exactly.

957
02:01:00,042 --> 02:01:04,499
It's not very polite to eat
from one plate.

958
02:01:05,375 --> 02:01:09,791
Or to use one spoon or fork.

959
02:01:12,292 --> 02:01:15,082
- Hey, boy...
- Hey, boy.

960
02:01:15,750 --> 02:01:17,916
Set the table for one more.

961
02:01:18,250 --> 02:01:21,207
Hey, boy!
Set the table for one more!

962
02:01:25,125 --> 02:01:27,457
Busqueros entertained me...

963
02:01:31,542 --> 02:01:33,457
with gossip from Madrid.

964
02:01:33,750 --> 02:01:39,166
But I was impatiently looking
forward to going to Buen Retiro.

965
02:01:39,542 --> 02:01:43,666
This remote park is described
in many love stories.

966
02:01:45,250 --> 02:01:52,666
I had a feeling I would start
a love relationship there.

967
02:02:24,875 --> 02:02:28,624
Madam, I think I found
what you are looking for.

968
02:02:28,917 --> 02:02:31,541
I lost a locket
with a piece of gold chain.

969
02:02:31,875 --> 02:02:34,082
Does it have an inscription?

970
02:02:35,125 --> 02:02:41,249
You read that my name is Inez.
It has my portrait.

971
02:02:41,542 --> 02:02:47,166
I want to remind you that
a finder usually gets a reward.

972
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:49,957
Seńor, you're too importunate
for a first meeting.

973
02:02:50,250 --> 02:02:54,499
Congratulations. You've met the son
of the richest merchant in Cadiz.

974
02:02:54,792 --> 02:02:58,416
Did I encourage
strangers to talk to me?

975
02:02:59,250 --> 02:03:01,207
Lopez Soarez.

976
02:03:01,500 --> 02:03:03,624
May I have my locket back?

977
02:03:14,042 --> 02:03:15,499
Go away!

978
02:03:46,125 --> 02:03:48,249
Seńor Don Lopez.

979
02:03:48,542 --> 02:03:51,999
I rejected twenty invitations
and I came to see you.

980
02:03:52,292 --> 02:03:56,749
You must admit that I did you
a favour yesterday.

981
02:03:57,042 --> 02:04:02,791
I mentioned that you're the son
of one of the richest merchants.

982
02:04:06,375 --> 02:04:11,041
She pretended to be angry
only to convince you that

983
02:04:11,625 --> 02:04:15,291
wealth did not impress her.

984
02:04:17,500 --> 02:04:23,707
Don't believe it.
You're young, smart, handsome.

985
02:04:24,292 --> 02:04:28,749
But remember that gold
is never an obstacle in love.

986
02:04:36,917 --> 02:04:39,457
What will we do this afternoon?

987
02:04:41,125 --> 02:04:43,874
I want to see the city... alone.

988
02:04:44,417 --> 02:04:47,457
Seńor, it was a deadlock.

989
02:04:49,500 --> 02:04:51,291
Go, you fool.

990
02:04:51,625 --> 02:04:53,832
Say your prayers!

991
02:05:12,292 --> 02:05:14,957
My brother gave me that locket.

992
02:05:23,000 --> 02:05:24,916
No more questions.

993
02:05:26,250 --> 02:05:27,374
But...

994
02:05:27,667 --> 02:05:30,624
Unless you find something
that belongs to me.

995
02:05:30,917 --> 02:05:34,374
Then you can claim a reward.

996
02:05:38,375 --> 02:05:40,749
We shouldn't be seen together.

997
02:05:48,375 --> 02:05:53,541
"Lopez Soarez to..."

998
02:05:54,750 --> 02:05:56,291
What?

999
02:05:58,625 --> 02:06:00,166
"To Inez.

1000
02:06:04,125 --> 02:06:09,082
I am charmed... comma.

1001
02:06:09,500 --> 02:06:12,541
And you are the sole reason of it.

1002
02:06:18,667 --> 02:06:24,082
I want to share
my thoughts in this letter,

1003
02:06:29,167 --> 02:06:31,832
but they seem to scatter".

1004
02:06:45,542 --> 02:06:47,207
I've got it.

1005
02:07:05,750 --> 02:07:08,332
Don Roque! Give it back!

1006
02:07:10,875 --> 02:07:12,207
Where are you?

1007
02:07:20,167 --> 02:07:21,374
Don Roque?

1008
02:07:21,667 --> 02:07:22,874
Don Lopez!

1009
02:07:27,125 --> 02:07:28,291
Stop!

1010
02:07:49,417 --> 02:07:53,374
Well? Your letter
has been delivered.

1011
02:07:54,125 --> 02:07:57,749
You should be grateful, seńor.

1012
02:08:15,875 --> 02:08:17,207
Madam...

1013
02:08:20,625 --> 02:08:26,457
Why did you use this impertinent
man to deliver your letter?

1014
02:08:27,375 --> 02:08:31,374
I wrote that letter
for my own pleasure.

1015
02:08:31,667 --> 02:08:33,749
He stole it from me.

1016
02:08:35,250 --> 02:08:40,332
Ever since I came to Madrid,
he haunts me like an evil spirit.

1017
02:08:40,625 --> 02:08:44,124
I shouldn't keep this nonsense.

1018
02:08:51,750 --> 02:08:54,749
What would you like to know?

1019
02:08:55,042 --> 02:08:59,082
I want to know who you are
and what is your name.

1020
02:08:59,375 --> 02:09:02,666
I'm the daughter of a man
who is as rich as your father.

1021
02:09:03,000 --> 02:09:05,999
- Banker Moro.
- Moro?

1022
02:09:07,542 --> 02:09:09,957
- The curse of my life!
- Seńor.

1023
02:09:10,250 --> 02:09:14,707
I can't even think about you
or my father will curse me.

1024
02:09:15,000 --> 02:09:18,249
He crossed many seas to be
a merchant in Cadiz.

1025
02:09:18,542 --> 02:09:19,791
In Cadiz...

1026
02:09:20,125 --> 02:09:24,666
Don't let that discourage you.
Rich men are hard to catch.

1027
02:09:25,000 --> 02:09:27,832
But sooner or later
they'll take the bait.

1028
02:09:29,167 --> 02:09:30,749
Stop it!

1029
02:09:31,042 --> 02:09:33,041
You'll scare my dog.

1030
02:09:34,000 --> 02:09:37,999
Only death is left for me.
May lightning strike me.

1031
02:09:38,625 --> 02:09:40,374
Don't be afraid.

1032
02:09:40,667 --> 02:09:43,457
- Inez loves you very much.
- Me?

1033
02:09:43,750 --> 02:09:48,707
She wants to meet you here,
tomorrow at sunset.

1034
02:10:27,000 --> 02:10:30,666
I understand that at your age
you don't want to get married.

1035
02:10:31,375 --> 02:10:34,124
But your excuse is strange.

1036
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:39,374
The wrath of a father who crossed
many seas to be a merchant in Cadiz?

1037
02:10:39,667 --> 02:10:42,332
You're lucky.
I fixed everything.

1038
02:10:42,625 --> 02:10:47,957
Seńor Don Roque,
can you do me another favour?

1039
02:10:48,542 --> 02:10:51,207
Don't go to Buen Retiro tonight.

1040
02:10:52,000 --> 02:10:53,707
Fair Inez won't be there.

1041
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:59,582
But I want to sit on our bench
and wallow in my sorrow.

1042
02:11:01,500 --> 02:11:05,916
There's something offensive
in your words.

1043
02:11:06,250 --> 02:11:10,707
It looks like you don't appreciate
what I've do for you.

1044
02:11:11,000 --> 02:11:12,332
Seńor...

1045
02:11:19,250 --> 02:11:23,082
"Jasmine exudes
its balmy fragrance.

1046
02:11:25,000 --> 02:11:27,416
Trees are getting greener.

1047
02:11:28,375 --> 02:11:31,249
All you did was walk under them.

1048
02:11:33,417 --> 02:11:37,082
What will become of a heart..."

1049
02:11:45,292 --> 02:11:48,874
I could let you wallow
in your sorrow alone.

1050
02:11:49,167 --> 02:11:51,249
But fair Inez may come.

1051
02:11:51,542 --> 02:11:53,916
Who will help you out?

1052
02:11:56,792 --> 02:11:58,374
What is this?

1053
02:12:00,000 --> 02:12:06,374
I'll tell you a story to kill time.
You may learn from it.

1054
02:12:07,000 --> 02:12:09,707
I always had talent
for studying law.

1055
02:12:10,000 --> 02:12:12,291
I was eager to know
people and life.

1056
02:12:50,750 --> 02:12:53,624
What is it?

1057
02:12:57,250 --> 02:12:59,582
The bloody head!

1058
02:13:20,375 --> 02:13:22,624
I took you for my relative.

1059
02:13:22,917 --> 02:13:25,541
We had something
important to discuss.

1060
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:30,332
I don't know you or the reason
for this unexpected visit.

1061
02:13:30,625 --> 02:13:33,124
I didn't mean to enter your room.

1062
02:13:33,417 --> 02:13:36,541
I was just curious who lives here.

1063
02:13:36,875 --> 02:13:40,791
I'm a lawyer
and I study human life.

1064
02:13:41,375 --> 02:13:43,291
That makes a difference.

1065
02:13:43,625 --> 02:13:47,124
It's nice to know
what other people are doing.

1066
02:13:47,417 --> 02:13:49,707
Before you woke up, madam,

1067
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:56,832
your husband did me the honour
of calling me ‘'the bloody head".

1068
02:14:11,875 --> 02:14:15,624
- That woman...
- I don't have time for this.

1069
02:14:18,125 --> 02:14:22,291
When a decent man is telling you
a fascinating story,

1070
02:14:22,625 --> 02:14:24,374
you shouldn't interrupt.

1071
02:14:24,667 --> 02:14:26,624
No excuses!

1072
02:14:27,750 --> 02:14:29,249
That woman...

1073
02:14:31,542 --> 02:14:33,749
Let me explain.

1074
02:14:38,125 --> 02:14:44,374
I'm the daughter of a brave officer.
My name is Frasquetta Salero.

1075
02:14:48,042 --> 02:14:52,124
I started to attract men
as a young girl.

1076
02:14:52,500 --> 02:14:55,957
Frasquetta, be modest!

1077
02:14:57,250 --> 02:14:58,541
But mom!

1078
02:15:00,042 --> 02:15:05,457
How can I be impolite
to those elegant young men?

1079
02:15:23,875 --> 02:15:25,957
Did you drop something?

1080
02:15:27,750 --> 02:15:30,957
Too bad. If you had dropped
that cross pendant,

1081
02:15:31,250 --> 02:15:34,832
I'd pick it up and keep it
as a dear souvenir.

1082
02:15:44,500 --> 02:15:47,249
Frasquetta!
Get away from the window!

1083
02:16:15,125 --> 02:16:19,666
Unfortunately that young man
never showed up again.

1084
02:16:24,500 --> 02:16:26,707
My lovely wife.

1085
02:16:29,792 --> 02:16:31,874
You're so beautiful.

1086
02:16:33,250 --> 02:16:36,874
- Do you love your hubby?
- I do.

1087
02:16:39,000 --> 02:16:42,832
- And nobody else?
- Nobody.

1088
02:16:59,625 --> 02:17:03,374
- What's that, boy?
- A letter for Madam Frasquetta.

1089
02:17:03,667 --> 02:17:05,082
Give it to me.

1090
02:17:06,292 --> 02:17:08,374
I'm her father.

1091
02:17:09,042 --> 02:17:10,416
Here.

1092
02:17:15,750 --> 02:17:19,541
A ring? What ring?

1093
02:17:21,167 --> 02:17:24,791
"I'm waiting and longing for you.
Pena Flor".

1094
02:17:36,000 --> 02:17:37,374
Frasquetta?

1095
02:17:38,167 --> 02:17:39,707
Do you love me?

1096
02:17:40,875 --> 02:17:42,249
I do.

1097
02:17:48,000 --> 02:17:51,749
Nothing will stand
in the way of our love.

1098
02:18:08,375 --> 02:18:09,999
Excellent, Don Ramiro!

1099
02:18:10,292 --> 02:18:14,207
If you're just as brave
with noble Count Pena Flor,

1100
02:18:14,500 --> 02:18:17,124
he will no longer be
a terror to husbands.

1101
02:18:17,417 --> 02:18:20,332
So what if I put an end
to his love conquests?

1102
02:18:20,625 --> 02:18:23,874
I'll have to suffer consequences
for this duel.

1103
02:18:25,417 --> 02:18:32,041
If I had one hundred doubloons,
I'd go and hide on an island.

1104
02:18:36,625 --> 02:18:40,124
I'll offer you one hundred doubloons
for this noble cause.

1105
02:19:16,625 --> 02:19:19,874
There was a murder yesterday.
It was Count...

1106
02:19:20,167 --> 02:19:21,249
Pena Flor.

1107
02:19:22,042 --> 02:19:26,082
We found a letter
on one of the thugs.

1108
02:19:26,375 --> 02:19:29,874
It said you offered

1109
02:19:30,250 --> 02:19:35,374
one hundred doubloons to kill him.

1110
02:19:35,875 --> 02:19:38,624
I never met Seńor Pena Flor.

1111
02:19:39,625 --> 02:19:43,416
Yesterday two men came
with a promissory note for that sum,

1112
02:19:43,750 --> 02:19:46,457
which I signed a year ago.

1113
02:19:47,375 --> 02:19:48,999
You want to see it?

1114
02:19:49,292 --> 02:19:54,332
I'm from the criminal court.
I'm not interested in transactions.

1115
02:19:54,625 --> 02:19:56,582
I have no further questions.

1116
02:19:56,875 --> 02:19:59,082
Sorry for bothering you.

1117
02:20:09,000 --> 02:20:14,499
Did you really pay somebody
to kill that seńor?

1118
02:20:14,792 --> 02:20:16,916
Why? You don't know him.

1119
02:20:21,625 --> 02:20:26,291
I would go on a pilgrimage
to St. Jacob of Compostella,

1120
02:20:26,875 --> 02:20:32,457
or even further,
if I believed it would help me.

1121
02:20:33,750 --> 02:20:35,374
- Nice story.
- Yes.

1122
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:41,666
Strange things have been happening
in our house ever since.

1123
02:20:53,875 --> 02:20:58,249
Take your
one hundred doubloons back!

1124
02:21:17,625 --> 02:21:19,082
Don Diego!

1125
02:21:38,417 --> 02:21:39,666
I like that.

1126
02:21:41,000 --> 02:21:42,374
Needless to say,

1127
02:21:42,667 --> 02:21:47,541
I made up Count Pena Flor
to upset my husband

1128
02:21:47,875 --> 02:21:52,582
and make him go on a pilgrimage.

1129
02:21:54,000 --> 02:21:58,874
The justice clerks
and the thugs were paid people.

1130
02:21:59,375 --> 02:22:02,291
Now I get it. The bloody head!

1131
02:22:05,750 --> 02:22:09,374
I took you for somebody else.

1132
02:22:09,875 --> 02:22:11,166
Enough!

1133
02:22:11,500 --> 02:22:15,249
- I haven't finished yet.
- Later. Duty calls.

1134
02:22:15,542 --> 02:22:18,041
Seńor Don Lopez,
do you want to offend me?

1135
02:22:18,375 --> 02:22:21,582
Yes. There is no other way
to get rid of you.

1136
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:29,207
Your daddy will be glad.

1137
02:22:47,500 --> 02:22:51,207
So where was I?

1138
02:22:53,917 --> 02:23:00,291
That very night I found myself
in totally different circumstances.

1139
02:23:09,792 --> 02:23:13,624
You're lucky it's only an injury.
I could have killed you.

1140
02:23:14,875 --> 02:23:20,749
Easy. I'll take care of everything.
Don't worry.

1141
02:23:21,375 --> 02:23:27,582
It's a pity you interrupted my story.
It was getting interesting.

1142
02:23:28,375 --> 02:23:29,957
Listen.

1143
02:23:30,250 --> 02:23:35,707
That very night I found myself
in totally different circumstances.

1144
02:24:10,125 --> 02:24:11,666
What happened?

1145
02:24:12,000 --> 02:24:14,041
Seńor Don Lopez.

1146
02:24:21,250 --> 02:24:23,749
Don't strain yourself.

1147
02:24:32,625 --> 02:24:34,957
- It's long.
- Who is it from?

1148
02:24:35,250 --> 02:24:37,207
Don't be a child.

1149
02:24:37,500 --> 02:24:41,416
It's from fair Inez.
It's settled.

1150
02:24:41,750 --> 02:24:42,874
What is it?

1151
02:24:43,167 --> 02:24:46,874
She wants you to meet her
at her place tonight.

1152
02:24:47,167 --> 02:24:49,832
The wedding is tomorrow.
Happy?

1153
02:24:50,125 --> 02:24:53,041
What place?
The Moro house? How?

1154
02:24:53,375 --> 02:24:55,957
- Well?
- The usual way.

1155
02:24:56,375 --> 02:24:59,916
- Their house is guarded.
- The tried way.

1156
02:25:00,292 --> 02:25:01,874
Take it easy.

1157
02:25:02,167 --> 02:25:03,999
I'll take care of it.

1158
02:25:05,167 --> 02:25:10,332
I don't know what you
would do without me.

1159
02:25:35,917 --> 02:25:36,957
Which window?

1160
02:25:37,417 --> 02:25:40,582
One, two, three.
The third one.

1161
02:25:40,875 --> 02:25:42,207
Which one?

1162
02:25:43,250 --> 02:25:44,499
The third!

1163
02:25:51,292 --> 02:25:54,457
- This is the window of fair Inez.
- My heart is pounding.

1164
02:25:54,750 --> 02:25:58,916
I'm touched, seńor.
Please don't embarrass me.

1165
02:25:59,250 --> 02:26:00,957
I'm really grateful.

1166
02:26:01,250 --> 02:26:04,582
You have to go for it.

1167
02:26:04,875 --> 02:26:05,874
Yes.

1168
02:26:06,167 --> 02:26:10,832
When I clap my hands,
enter the heavens.

1169
02:26:11,292 --> 02:26:13,249
- Ready?
- Yes.

1170
02:26:23,875 --> 02:26:24,916
Up!

1171
02:26:26,125 --> 02:26:29,707
Balmy fragrance... jasmine.

1172
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:31,707
Oh God!

1173
02:26:49,500 --> 02:26:51,166
Are you gone?

1174
02:26:52,750 --> 02:26:54,832
Yes!

1175
02:26:56,375 --> 02:27:01,166
Is there purgatory
in the other world?

1176
02:27:04,500 --> 02:27:07,749
Yes! That's where I am!

1177
02:27:13,542 --> 02:27:15,249
Was there a storm that night?

1178
02:27:15,542 --> 02:27:19,041
Lightning was flashing.
He got the wrong window.

1179
02:27:19,375 --> 02:27:22,624
Seńor,
I found the purgatorial soul!

1180
02:27:22,917 --> 02:27:24,041
Where?

1181
02:27:25,667 --> 02:27:27,707
What are you talking about?

1182
02:27:54,500 --> 02:27:56,082
Seńor Toledo.

1183
02:27:59,667 --> 02:28:01,749
Listen.

1184
02:28:07,792 --> 02:28:09,082
No.

1185
02:28:12,542 --> 02:28:15,166
I'm ending my penance.

1186
02:28:19,500 --> 02:28:21,916
How did you find out?

1187
02:28:22,750 --> 02:28:24,749
Lopez Soarez told me.

1188
02:28:26,000 --> 02:28:29,541
- A merchant from Cadiz.
- How did it happen?

1189
02:28:29,875 --> 02:28:34,082
- Busqueros got the wrong window.
- Busqueros? Right.

1190
02:28:34,375 --> 02:28:35,791
Never met him.

1191
02:28:36,125 --> 02:28:39,999
Tell him to drop by.
I want to know the details.

1192
02:28:45,875 --> 02:28:51,249
You think that lady who gave you
her glove is still faithful to me?

1193
02:28:51,542 --> 02:28:53,749
- I'm sure.
- Farewell.

1194
02:29:00,250 --> 02:29:04,999
I decided to find that nuisance
of a man known in Madrid.

1195
02:29:08,167 --> 02:29:10,416
Please don't stop now.

1196
02:29:10,750 --> 02:29:14,707
Allow me to devote a few
minutes to that man.

1197
02:29:19,125 --> 02:29:24,374
Frasquetta told her story
to Busqueros.

1198
02:29:24,750 --> 02:29:28,291
He told it to Lopez Soarez,

1199
02:29:29,125 --> 02:29:33,124
who told it to Seńor Avadoro.

1200
02:29:34,292 --> 02:29:35,374
It's crazy.

1201
02:29:36,542 --> 02:29:41,332
When these stories begin,
the listener thinks they'll end.

1202
02:29:41,625 --> 02:29:45,457
But one story creates
another story and another.

1203
02:29:45,750 --> 02:29:50,332
Like quotients
which can be divided infinitely.

1204
02:29:51,375 --> 02:29:54,624
I'm captain of the guard,
not a philosopher.

1205
02:29:54,917 --> 02:29:57,416
Your math is dead numbers.

1206
02:29:58,125 --> 02:29:59,749
Dead numbers?

1207
02:30:00,042 --> 02:30:02,207
Zero, plus and minus one

1208
02:30:02,542 --> 02:30:06,082
gave Archimedes and Newton
power equal to the gods.

1209
02:30:06,500 --> 02:30:09,666
Very noble people.
What's the point of this?

1210
02:30:17,375 --> 02:30:22,874
We are like blind men lost
in the streets of a strange city.

1211
02:30:24,250 --> 02:30:27,832
The streets lead to somewhere,

1212
02:30:28,167 --> 02:30:34,916
but we go back to the same
places to get to our destination.

1213
02:30:36,875 --> 02:30:42,249
I see a few streets here
which lead to nowhere.

1214
02:30:44,417 --> 02:30:49,124
If you find new combinations,
everything will be clear.

1215
02:30:49,792 --> 02:30:55,832
Whatever man invents,
man can work out.

1216
02:30:57,625 --> 02:31:00,124
I admit I don't follow.

1217
02:31:00,750 --> 02:31:02,791
Let's listen.

1218
02:31:04,417 --> 02:31:08,624
Cavalier Toledo became
his own happy self again.

1219
02:31:09,250 --> 02:31:13,832
I went to look for
that nuisance of a man.

1220
02:31:15,750 --> 02:31:19,582
I happened to meet him
that very day.

1221
02:31:50,875 --> 02:31:53,541
I like you.
You can be my servant.

1222
02:31:54,625 --> 02:31:59,416
Be thankful. New prospects
are opening up before you.

1223
02:32:00,125 --> 02:32:03,374
I bet you haven't met
many noblemen.

1224
02:32:04,750 --> 02:32:09,749
I can prove that I was
raised like a nobleman.

1225
02:32:10,500 --> 02:32:16,999
I wasn't born a beggar.
It's a twist of fate.

1226
02:32:18,625 --> 02:32:19,624
Good.

1227
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:25,957
Let's go, seńor.

1228
02:32:39,250 --> 02:32:42,374
You may not like
your duties at first.

1229
02:32:42,667 --> 02:32:45,374
You won't be paid.

1230
02:32:45,875 --> 02:32:51,457
Or get new clothes.
As far as board...

1231
02:32:51,750 --> 02:32:57,416
Aren't you Seńor Don Busqueros,
who helped Lopez Soarez?

1232
02:32:58,250 --> 02:32:59,707
Yes. That's me.

1233
02:33:00,000 --> 02:33:03,332
There would be a happy end
if it weren't for the storm.

1234
02:33:03,625 --> 02:33:06,999
I got the wrong window.
But I'm not through yet.

1235
02:33:07,292 --> 02:33:10,082
Cavalier Toledo
would like to meet you, seńor.

1236
02:33:10,375 --> 02:33:13,666
Toledo? I'm honoured.

1237
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:19,416
I found out that Lopez's father
came from Cadiz and is staying...

1238
02:33:19,750 --> 02:33:20,999
in this house.

1239
02:33:21,292 --> 02:33:24,374
He waited for his son in vain
and went out. Where?

1240
02:33:24,667 --> 02:33:28,541
Where can a provincial man go to?
Well?

1241
02:33:28,875 --> 02:33:33,207
- To see the church.
- Wrong, you noble tramp.

1242
02:33:34,625 --> 02:33:36,749
- To the tavern.
- Which one?

1243
02:33:37,042 --> 02:33:38,749
The nearest one.

1244
02:34:06,167 --> 02:34:08,374
Seńor, it's not possible.

1245
02:34:11,417 --> 02:34:15,124
You must admit Cadiz
is more important than Madrid.

1246
02:34:15,417 --> 02:34:17,832
What's more, Soarez,
who was short of funds,

1247
02:34:18,125 --> 02:34:22,124
could do his trading
owing to Levardez.

1248
02:34:22,625 --> 02:34:26,749
Later Moro, his beneficiary, had to go
to court to get his money back.

1249
02:34:27,042 --> 02:34:28,166
The trial is still going on.

1250
02:34:28,500 --> 02:34:32,749
No. Soarez sued banker Moro
to make him accept

1251
02:34:33,042 --> 02:34:36,332
not one but two million profit.

1252
02:34:36,875 --> 02:34:42,499
The Soarez family is one
of the most respectable in Spain.

1253
02:34:42,792 --> 02:34:46,041
It's a fact.
You have a big mouth. Go away.

1254
02:34:52,292 --> 02:34:56,249
I see that you're
an honest merchant.

1255
02:34:57,750 --> 02:35:02,916
Your words do me honour.
I'm Gaspar Soarez from Cadiz.

1256
02:35:03,542 --> 02:35:05,374
My name is Moraredo.

1257
02:35:05,667 --> 02:35:07,374
You are a godsend.

1258
02:35:08,125 --> 02:35:13,041
I can tell that you're
a true connoisseur of life.

1259
02:35:13,375 --> 02:35:15,124
I'm at your service.

1260
02:35:15,750 --> 02:35:19,166
I sent my son here and I forbade
him to use the tile of "Don".

1261
02:35:19,500 --> 02:35:21,999
- To associate with noblemen.
- Very wise.

1262
02:35:22,292 --> 02:35:24,457
- And to use the sword.
- I understand.

1263
02:35:24,750 --> 02:35:27,707
But my Lopez is Don Lopez now.

1264
02:35:28,167 --> 02:35:33,082
The only man he is close
with is a nobleman Busqueros.

1265
02:35:33,375 --> 02:35:34,666
Unbelievable.

1266
02:35:35,000 --> 02:35:38,416
He had a duel with him
and was thrown out of the window.

1267
02:35:40,875 --> 02:35:43,166
I want to marry him off.

1268
02:35:44,792 --> 02:35:49,499
Do you know any young lady
from a respectable family?

1269
02:35:49,792 --> 02:35:52,499
I do.

1270
02:35:53,125 --> 02:35:56,249
Her father, a noble merchant,
is very angry.

1271
02:35:56,542 --> 02:35:58,666
He said he would lock her away
in a monastery

1272
02:35:59,000 --> 02:36:01,749
if she didn't pick
a husband this week.

1273
02:36:02,042 --> 02:36:05,957
- I'd like to talk to her.
- You'll meet her today.

1274
02:36:07,125 --> 02:36:08,582
In an inn?

1275
02:36:08,875 --> 02:36:13,957
- A lady from a respectable family?
- Incognito. Time is short.

1276
02:36:15,250 --> 02:36:18,291
Seńor is paying. Goodbye.

1277
02:36:26,375 --> 02:36:30,916
Today you'll understand
the true value of my friendship.

1278
02:36:39,625 --> 02:36:45,874
You must admit that I'm good
at dealing with problems.

1279
02:36:53,667 --> 02:36:57,916
I judge from the way
you stood up for me that you're

1280
02:36:58,250 --> 02:37:02,291
an expert on merchant matters.

1281
02:37:02,625 --> 02:37:05,957
- Excuse me, seńor...
- Moraredo.

1282
02:37:06,917 --> 02:37:11,249
But your name is not known
in merchant circles.

1283
02:37:11,792 --> 02:37:13,499
You know, seńor...

1284
02:37:13,792 --> 02:37:17,249
I assume you didn't have
a chance to try

1285
02:37:17,542 --> 02:37:22,041
your hand at a business
of your own.

1286
02:37:31,500 --> 02:37:35,041
Impertinence is not why I'm here.

1287
02:37:35,917 --> 02:37:41,249
I came because my father's anger
forces me to seek salvation.

1288
02:37:42,750 --> 02:37:48,166
- I respect the Soarez family.
- I am honoured, my lady.

1289
02:37:51,000 --> 02:37:53,374
You want to marry Miss Moro?

1290
02:37:54,000 --> 02:37:55,666
Miss Moro?

1291
02:37:57,000 --> 02:37:59,416
Aren't your intentions serious?

1292
02:37:59,875 --> 02:38:01,624
It's a misunderstanding!

1293
02:38:02,000 --> 02:38:05,832
If you can kneel before my sister,
you're not too old to fight me.

1294
02:38:06,125 --> 02:38:07,541
Get your sword
or jump out the window!

1295
02:38:07,875 --> 02:38:10,707
- What?
- Your honour is at stake.

1296
02:38:26,292 --> 02:38:27,499
Daddy!

1297
02:38:31,875 --> 02:38:35,374
Son, I forbade you to associate
with noblemen.

1298
02:38:35,667 --> 02:38:38,582
Daddy, it's just one.
He's standing next to you.

1299
02:38:38,875 --> 02:38:40,957
You shouldn't have fought
a duel with him.

1300
02:38:41,250 --> 02:38:44,457
Mind you, seńor.
You're holding a sword.

1301
02:38:49,625 --> 02:38:51,166
Lopez, Lopez....

1302
02:38:51,500 --> 02:38:53,666
Why did you choose Miss Moro?

1303
02:38:54,000 --> 02:38:57,957
Seńor, you were just kneeling
at her feet yourself.

1304
02:39:05,875 --> 02:39:11,957
Seńor Gaspar Soarez,
punishment fits the crime.

1305
02:39:12,250 --> 02:39:16,749
We would be honoured if your son
asked for my daughter's hand.

1306
02:39:17,042 --> 02:39:20,374
Instead he chose to sneak
in through the window.

1307
02:39:20,667 --> 02:39:26,832
I'm sure it was all because of
that dispute over the two million,

1308
02:39:27,125 --> 02:39:29,207
which you think I should accept.

1309
02:39:29,500 --> 02:39:30,541
Yes.

1310
02:39:30,875 --> 02:39:35,249
I will. Provided I can add
another two million

1311
02:39:35,542 --> 02:39:39,999
and give it to your son
along with my daughter's hand.

1312
02:39:52,375 --> 02:39:54,207
You did a good job.

1313
02:39:59,375 --> 02:40:02,207
Well done, seńor.

1314
02:40:02,500 --> 02:40:05,707
It's easy to see
how this story goes on.

1315
02:40:06,667 --> 02:40:10,082
Lopez moved to his future
father in law's house.

1316
02:40:10,375 --> 02:40:14,541
Inez will see to it
that he gets well.

1317
02:40:15,667 --> 02:40:20,041
I want to hear more
about that love affair.

1318
02:40:21,792 --> 02:40:28,666
Was this woman Frasquetta
really so enticing?

1319
02:40:31,750 --> 02:40:36,416
I told that story
to a young merchant.

1320
02:40:36,750 --> 02:40:40,457
Yes. Lopez Soarez passed it
on to my friend.

1321
02:40:41,125 --> 02:40:43,499
That's how I heard about it.

1322
02:40:43,792 --> 02:40:46,374
Your memory is admirable.

1323
02:40:46,667 --> 02:40:51,666
Since you know her story,
I'll tell you about her husband

1324
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:58,874
and how he got to meet
one unfortunate man.

1325
02:40:59,167 --> 02:41:00,916
Go on.

1326
02:41:01,667 --> 02:41:06,541
That very night I found myself
in totally different circumstance.

1327
02:43:17,042 --> 02:43:18,207
Who are you?

1328
02:43:18,500 --> 02:43:21,041
See this sign? Satan sent me.

1329
02:43:21,375 --> 02:43:26,916
- Stop tormenting me!
- What do you mean?

1330
02:43:27,250 --> 02:43:28,832
What about
the one hundred doubloons

1331
02:43:29,125 --> 02:43:30,749
that you paid for the head
of Count Pena Flor?

1332
02:43:31,042 --> 02:43:32,249
What do you want?

1333
02:43:32,917 --> 02:43:34,332
See this?

1334
02:43:34,917 --> 02:43:40,499
Before he died, he outbid you.

1335
02:43:43,375 --> 02:43:44,624
Don't stab me!

1336
02:44:04,792 --> 02:44:08,374
That was quite an hour.

1337
02:44:08,750 --> 02:44:11,041
You didn't disappoint me.

1338
02:44:11,375 --> 02:44:16,166
Excuse me for telling
things that are sinful.

1339
02:44:16,500 --> 02:44:19,624
But you can learn a lot
from that story.

1340
02:44:22,000 --> 02:44:24,791
What happened to Madam Cornandez?

1341
02:44:25,125 --> 02:44:27,374
She became a widow.

1342
02:44:27,875 --> 02:44:32,374
Later she married her lover
and leads a blameless life.

1343
02:44:32,750 --> 02:44:33,874
There she is!

1344
02:44:36,250 --> 02:44:39,499
What? It's Dona Uscariz.

1345
02:44:40,667 --> 02:44:42,166
Frasquetta.

1346
02:44:49,125 --> 02:44:50,541
Help!

1347
02:44:53,042 --> 02:44:55,832
- I can't.
- Out the window!

1348
02:44:58,875 --> 02:45:03,166
- She said I was her only lover.
- There are other women.

1349
02:45:12,625 --> 02:45:13,749
Toledo?

1350
02:45:14,042 --> 02:45:16,957
- Seńor Toledo!
- Run!

1351
02:45:18,792 --> 02:45:19,999
Don't panic!

1352
02:45:36,250 --> 02:45:38,499
I have to think it over.

1353
02:45:38,792 --> 02:45:40,541
Carefully this time.

1354
02:45:41,875 --> 02:45:44,874
- Seńor!
- Farewell, my friends!

1355
02:45:45,167 --> 02:45:46,624
- Your sword.
- No.

1356
02:45:57,000 --> 02:45:59,999
His life is quite exhausting.

1357
02:46:00,292 --> 02:46:03,999
Don't you think there should be
a ladder under every window?

1358
02:46:06,500 --> 02:46:08,124
Just in case.

1359
02:46:27,167 --> 02:46:28,332
What's going on?

1360
02:46:28,625 --> 02:46:31,582
Officers of the guard are
sorting out their differences.

1361
02:46:51,875 --> 02:46:56,582
- It must be a serious dilemma.
- There were other reasons.

1362
02:47:09,417 --> 02:47:13,874
- You stand by your word?
- I never take back what I say.

1363
02:47:33,375 --> 02:47:38,874
If I'm not mistaken,
that brave officer was your father.

1364
02:47:48,792 --> 02:47:53,416
The chronicle of his duels
mentions it.

1365
02:47:53,750 --> 02:47:58,666
To avoid feuds,
he had two duels that day.

1366
02:48:00,917 --> 02:48:03,707
He wounded five men
in the afternoon.

1367
02:48:04,000 --> 02:48:07,207
And six in the evening.

1368
02:48:07,500 --> 02:48:10,249
He did the right thing.
Why get into feuds?

1369
02:48:12,375 --> 02:48:14,666
This is the end of the story.

1370
02:48:15,417 --> 02:48:17,916
You wanted to hear my adventures.

1371
02:48:18,250 --> 02:48:21,249
I hope your curiosity paid off.

1372
02:48:22,875 --> 02:48:24,582
It's time to say goodbye.

1373
02:48:24,875 --> 02:48:29,957
Saying goodbye, excuse me,

1374
02:48:30,375 --> 02:48:32,832
can be a sweet experience.

1375
02:48:33,125 --> 02:48:34,457
Seńor.

1376
02:48:38,625 --> 02:48:41,207
Important matters are calling.

1377
02:49:00,125 --> 02:49:02,749
But you said...

1378
02:49:16,000 --> 02:49:19,749
I don't think you have much
time left, seńor.

1379
02:51:33,500 --> 02:51:36,374
Alfonse van Worden,
we're waiting for you.

1380
02:51:39,125 --> 02:51:41,499
- Who are you?
- My name will tell you nothing.

1381
02:51:41,792 --> 02:51:44,124
Welcome to Gomelez land.

1382
02:53:01,625 --> 02:53:04,791
You remember me as the hermit.

1383
02:53:05,125 --> 02:53:10,041
Now you see I'm the Gomelez sheik.

1384
02:53:12,125 --> 02:53:17,791
You're here because you
haven't failed our hopes.

1385
02:53:23,750 --> 02:53:26,207
I'm captain of the guard.

1386
02:53:26,750 --> 02:53:30,666
It's time to reveal our secret.

1387
02:53:32,500 --> 02:53:36,041
The Prophet has blessed your love.

1388
02:53:37,292 --> 02:53:41,041
They will both be mothers soon.

1389
02:53:42,167 --> 02:53:45,041
We'll preserve our family line.

1390
02:53:55,250 --> 02:53:58,707
We deceived you
for quite a long time.

1391
02:53:59,000 --> 02:54:00,999
We wanted to be sure that

1392
02:54:01,292 --> 02:54:05,457
your first night at Venta Quemada
would bear fruit.

1393
02:54:06,417 --> 02:54:12,749
You're the only male descendant
of our vanishing family line.

1394
02:54:15,625 --> 02:54:19,582
Everything you experienced
was a planned game.

1395
02:54:19,875 --> 02:54:24,041
We wanted to test
your honour and courage.

1396
02:54:28,167 --> 02:54:32,291
So the ghosts and evil spirits
were your men?

1397
02:54:34,875 --> 02:54:37,916
- What about the kabbalist?
- That's right.

1398
02:54:38,250 --> 02:54:42,457
So was Pacheco.
He is a Basque acrobat.

1399
02:54:43,875 --> 02:54:49,499
He lost an eye
while performing a dangerous trick.

1400
02:54:53,875 --> 02:54:58,374
And Velasquez?
I won't believe it.

1401
02:54:59,375 --> 02:55:00,624
Yes.

1402
02:55:00,917 --> 02:55:03,666
This skeptic caused us
a lot of trouble.

1403
02:55:04,000 --> 02:55:07,041
But we rest our hopes
with Rebecca.

1404
02:55:07,500 --> 02:55:12,416
You'll find everything you saw
and experienced in this book.

1405
02:55:12,750 --> 02:55:15,707
Maybe I can finally sort it all out.

1406
02:55:25,250 --> 02:55:27,624
You can write the rest yourself.

1407
02:55:28,375 --> 02:55:33,666
May Allah cover your head
with the dew of happiness.

1408
02:55:38,875 --> 02:55:40,832
Kiss him, Zibelda.

1409
02:55:45,375 --> 02:55:48,916
I'll be happy to see him
in your embrace.

1410
02:55:56,375 --> 02:56:04,749
Every time I see you,
I'm afraid I won't see you again.

1411
02:56:06,125 --> 02:56:10,124
We may never meet again.

1412
02:56:10,417 --> 02:56:14,499
But we want to live in
your memory forever.

1413
02:56:16,000 --> 02:56:19,332
Saying goodbye can be
a sweet experience.

1414
02:56:20,875 --> 02:56:28,082
Now that I know everything,
can you tell me the truth?

1415
02:56:30,875 --> 02:56:31,874
Who are you?

1416
02:56:37,000 --> 02:56:38,416
Close your eyes.

1417
02:56:44,375 --> 02:56:48,041
When you hear your name,
follow us.

1418
02:57:01,125 --> 02:57:02,416
Now?

1419
02:58:25,375 --> 02:58:27,999
Will we make it before night?

1420
02:58:29,625 --> 02:58:31,207
Yes.

1421
02:58:32,417 --> 02:58:35,624
This time we will.

1422
02:58:54,250 --> 02:58:57,749
- Where have you been?
- The mules ran away, seńor.

1423
02:58:58,042 --> 02:59:01,207
Let's be on our way.
Hurry!

1424
02:59:38,167 --> 02:59:39,541
Reshoe him!

1425
02:59:59,167 --> 03:00:04,582
Comfort and peace -
that's what our inn offers.

1426
03:00:04,875 --> 03:00:11,666
For a long time
they thought I was doomed.

1427
03:00:12,375 --> 03:00:18,707
Everybody was overjoyed
when I arrived.

1428
03:00:19,000 --> 03:00:25,166
Only the sheik was sad to see me

1429
03:00:25,500 --> 03:00:27,832
weak and in poor health.

1430
03:00:29,125 --> 03:00:31,999
Dinner for the seńor!
Quick!

1431
03:00:35,125 --> 03:00:42,499
Two foreign ladies staying
in this inn invite you to supper.

1432
03:00:44,625 --> 03:00:45,999
What? Where?

1433
03:02:02,375 --> 03:02:06,541
THE END

1434
03:02:08,417 --> 03:02:13,582
