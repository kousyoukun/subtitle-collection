1
00:00:55,155 --> 00:00:58,352
There's some things
I never told you about Maria.

2
00:00:58,425 --> 00:01:01,553
Save the details till
after the honeymoon, homeboy.

3
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:06,889
She has some problems.

4
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,185
Daddy, I think there's a snap undone.
Would you take a look?

5
00:01:37,564 --> 00:01:40,158
I don't think so, honey.
Are you sure?

6
00:01:44,637 --> 00:01:46,571
I'm not feeling very well.

7
00:01:46,639 --> 00:01:49,836
Of course you don't. You're getting
married. Get used to it.

8
00:01:53,813 --> 00:01:58,182
- Here we go.
- She's a bit compulsive.

9
00:01:59,185 --> 00:02:02,211
Maybe I should say
compulsive and neurotic.

10
00:02:02,288 --> 00:02:04,483
Yeah, I know. She's Maria.

11
00:02:05,558 --> 00:02:07,423
She sleeps with a flyswatter.

12
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,930
Hell, if I looked like Maria,
I'd sleep with a bazooka.

13
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:14,199
So you guys got some issues.

14
00:02:14,267 --> 00:02:16,735
It's called modern romance.

15
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,344
If you need it, there's an ice chest
under your mother's seat.

16
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,755
I'm okay. I feel better now.

17
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,699
Careful of your dress, dear.

18
00:02:59,512 --> 00:03:05,075
She, uh-- She cleans the house
twice a day on her day off.

19
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:07,085
Yeah, well, at least she works.

20
00:03:07,153 --> 00:03:09,212
We get to go to all those
great magazine parties.

21
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:13,749
Hey, remember Claudia from
the Elle party? Oh, man.

22
00:03:13,826 --> 00:03:15,885
She's always locking
the bathroom door.

23
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,428
She gets suicidal
from time to time.

24
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:24,334
All women get suicidal
from time to time.

25
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,075
God, I love her.

26
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:46,651
So how long haveyou
known all ofthis?

27
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:52,097
Theyjust sort of creep up
on you, you know? One by one.

28
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:56,033
- And beforeyou know it--
- I say, don't panic.

29
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:58,332
It's probablyjust a phase.

30
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,998
Yeah.

31
00:04:01,074 --> 00:04:02,974
Yeah.

32
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:04,976
Here she is.

33
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:15,017
- You guys are awfully late.
- We're supposed to be late.

34
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:18,148
- Mom, you got my train?
- I got it, dear.

35
00:04:19,292 --> 00:04:23,285
- Come on, Dottie.
- I still think that dress is too tight.

36
00:04:24,797 --> 00:04:29,029
I require and chargeyou both as you
will answer on the Day ofJudgment...

37
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:33,163
when the secrets ofall hearts
will be disclosed...

38
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,969
that if either ofyou know
any impediment...

39
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:40,001
whyyou may not be lawfully
joined together in matrimony...

40
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:42,070
do now confess it.

41
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,751
Howmuch doyou love me?

42
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,117
Oh, a thousand.

43
00:04:49,188 --> 00:04:52,248
Only a thousand?
That's not very much.

44
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:56,921
I can even count to a thousand.
One, two, three, four--

45
00:04:56,996 --> 00:04:59,396
Okay, a hundred thousand
million billion.

46
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,328
That's better.
We're gonna be late for Alfred.

47
00:05:05,405 --> 00:05:09,068
Yeah, but I love the reason.
Besides, myJuliet...

48
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:12,043
wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?

49
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:21,618
How much satisfaction
can'st thou get in 1 1 minutes?

50
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,680
I'll be nicer in therapy.

51
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,494
How about the issues
wewere discussing last time?

52
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,059
Things are still the same.

53
00:05:38,137 --> 00:05:42,073
He's not nice to myfriends
or my parents.

54
00:05:42,141 --> 00:05:46,510
He's cheap. He flirts,
and he has a terrible temper.

55
00:05:47,513 --> 00:05:50,209
But I'm a loving,
tolerant woman, so--

56
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,875
Oh, that feels so good.

57
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:04,655
She keeps bugging me to build
another room on to the house.

58
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,395
- We don't have any money, so--
- It would, of course...

59
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:11,266
put his car out in the driveway
for a couple of months.

60
00:06:11,337 --> 00:06:13,328
Okay, okay.

61
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:17,205
Yes. Yeah.

62
00:06:17,276 --> 00:06:21,235
Oh, right there.
Right there. Yes.

63
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:25,080
Maria, why is this new addition
to the house so important toyou?

64
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:27,517
Because I wanna have a baby.

65
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:34,149
Go deeper.

66
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,630
With all this talk about a baby,
how's the sex?

67
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:42,960
You go first.

68
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:45,060
- You want me to?
- Sure. Why not?

69
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:50,399
Okay.

70
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:57,773
I have a confession to make.

71
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,487
I fake my orgasms.

72
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:10,222
Oh! Oh! Oh!

73
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,660
- You what?
- I didn't wanna tell you.

74
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:17,826
I didn't want to hurtyou.

75
00:07:20,006 --> 00:07:22,167
You're telling me
you've never had an orgasm?

76
00:07:26,012 --> 00:07:27,980
Not with you.

77
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:33,845
Joseph, it's important
you appreciate the risk...

78
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,286
Maria's taking in
communicating this toyou.

79
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:59,801
Doyou think
I'm a lousy lover?

80
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,914
Hmm?

81
00:08:15,728 --> 00:08:17,719
I loveyou, you know.

82
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,733
Whoa!

83
00:08:22,802 --> 00:08:24,793
Tell the balcony crew
those doors are in.

84
00:08:24,871 --> 00:08:27,738
Yo, Nick, you must have
fucked up big.

85
00:08:27,807 --> 00:08:30,071
We is humbled byyouse
royal presence, Sir Suits.

86
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:31,336
Relax, Carlos.

87
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,574
Yo, Nick, I go out on a limb to get
you this job, like I always do--

88
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:39,106
I wouldn't workwithoutyou,
Joseph, mywhite patron saint.

89
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,745
Well, thankyou, Nick,
but the problem is...

90
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,517
we're about four months behind
after two months on the job.

91
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,753
You geniuses made the schedule.
I just took the job.

92
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:49,192
Hey, Nick, what's this?

93
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,753
Oh, yeah, go ahead, Tanner.
Take a look.

94
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,096
- Yeah?
- It's a little discovery ofCarlos's.

95
00:08:55,167 --> 00:09:00,469
- Every hour on the hour.
- Holy shit! Oh, man!

96
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,405
This is unbelievable.
You gotta check this out.

97
00:09:02,475 --> 00:09:04,943
- This is unbelievable.
- Must be the redhead.

98
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:10,675
Oh, man. Mm-hmm!

99
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:14,177
Ooh!

100
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:16,244
You guys are perverts.

101
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:20,691
Areyou kiddin'? This guy's
a national treasure. One ofa kind.

102
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,955
- Holy shit!
- What doyou mean?

103
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,827
This guy has anywhere from four to
six women a day, one after the other.

104
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:28,958
And word has it he pleases
every one of'em.

105
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:33,563
-Joseph, take a look.
- No, I can see just fine.

106
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:37,268
Oh, my God!
Here comes another one.

107
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:44,043
I don't believe it. Theyjust
passed each other and said hi.

108
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:46,949
They said hi to each other.

109
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,180
- Oh,Jesus.
- Tanner.

110
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,189
- Yeah?
- Let's check out the site.

111
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:54,124
All right,Joseph, I am. I am.

112
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,257
- It's gotta be an implant.
- An implant?

113
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,299
Yeah, an implant, you know.
A lot of guys got 'em.

114
00:10:00,366 --> 00:10:02,266
It comes with a pump.

115
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,633
You just pump it up,
and itjust stays there...

116
00:10:04,704 --> 00:10:06,638
you know,
wheneveryou need it.

117
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:09,470
- Sounds like a good idea.
- Yeah, I gotta talk to that guy.

118
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:12,511
That redhead was to die for.
Oh, man, I wanna die.

119
00:10:14,046 --> 00:10:16,514
- Tanner?
- Yeah?

120
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,550
Does Vicky have orgasms?

121
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:21,246
- What?
- You know, does she--

122
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:24,983
Does she come when you're
doin' it, or does she fake it?

123
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:28,993
What? No!
Of course she has orgasms.

124
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,029
I mean, man, she goes crazy.

125
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:34,897
How doyou know?
I mean, she could be fakin' it.

126
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,629
You can tell. I mean,
they quiver all over.

127
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,536
Believe me, they quiver all over
even when they're fakin' it.

128
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:46,368
Shut the fuck up, would ya?

129
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,975
Come on, Freddie,
you little bugger.

130
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:56,921
Would you help me
with my tie, sweetheart?

131
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,980
Out, baby. Get out.

132
00:10:59,992 --> 00:11:01,721
Maria, we're gonna be late.

133
00:11:01,794 --> 00:11:05,195
Freddie listened to me.
He just flew out the window.

134
00:11:05,264 --> 00:11:07,198
How doyou know it's a he?

135
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,461
Because it bugs me, darling,
so it must be a he.

136
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,203
How do I look?
Do I have lipstick on my tooth?

137
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,209
Honey, every time
we come seeyour parents...

138
00:11:18,277 --> 00:11:20,609
you obsess
over the wayyou look.

139
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,615
Is my dress, okay? Do I need
to pull it down or anything?

140
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:26,345
You look fine.
Did you hear me?

141
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,118
Joseph, your tie is a mess.

142
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:37,618
Well, hello.
And how are the newlyweds?

143
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:39,790
- Hi, Dottie.
- We've been married seven months.

144
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:42,925
Yes, dear. Come on in.

145
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:46,027
Your father's
in the living room.

146
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:53,409
-Joseph, what are we--
- Surprise!

147
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:06,524
I'd say she's excited.
What would you say, hmm?

148
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:10,494
On a scale of one to ten,
about a four.

149
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:12,554
Oh, my God!

150
00:12:13,999 --> 00:12:16,160
- Martini time.
- Yeah.

151
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:20,103
How areyou?
Oh, my gosh! Look atyou!

152
00:12:37,523 --> 00:12:39,457
Why is it when we go to parties...

153
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,652
I always have to trackyou down
with a homing device?

154
00:12:46,298 --> 00:12:48,994
Ifyou loved me, you'd get in
that British fantasy ofyours...

155
00:12:49,068 --> 00:12:51,059
and drive me to Vegas.

156
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:59,938
Okay, let's play
"Ifyou love me," shall we?

157
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:04,413
- Go on. You start.
- Okay.

158
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:09,211
Ifyou loved me, you'd take me
to Paris on our second honeymoon.

159
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:17,454
Ifyou loved me, you wouldn't miss
your appointments with Alfred.

160
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,998
You'd buy us a house
in Briarwood...

161
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:24,502
with a big pool
and a little froufrou dog.

162
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:31,668
And you would stop
rearranging my closets.

163
00:13:33,612 --> 00:13:35,671
A baby girl...

164
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:37,773
and an air-conditioned garage...

165
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,581
for my 1 97 4 Ferrari
Daytona convertible.

166
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:47,491
- I love you, Maria.
- Shut up. It's still my turn.

167
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:50,393
It can always be
your turn, sweetheart.

168
00:13:50,462 --> 00:13:53,329
- Oh, baby, is that so?
- Mm-hmm.

169
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:01,404
It's your turn now.

170
00:14:01,473 --> 00:14:03,668
Honey, that's enough.

171
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,233
Oh, we'll both know
when it's enough, darling.

172
00:14:10,883 --> 00:14:13,408
Joseph, even though
I can't have an orgasm...

173
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,516
I still enjoy
making love toyou.

174
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,595
Sometimes I wonder
ifhe loves me.

175
00:14:38,077 --> 00:14:41,911
I feel he always avoids me.
He never returns my calls.

176
00:14:41,981 --> 00:14:44,449
His secretary, Connie,
is always apologizing for him.

177
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:46,450
That's not true.

178
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:49,954
- You're distorting things again.
-Just let me finish, okay?

179
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:56,127
Connie is embarrassed
every time I call...

180
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:58,129
because he won't
pick up the phone.

181
00:14:58,197 --> 00:15:00,529
She practically admits
you're avoiding me.

182
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:02,464
She calls seven
or eight times a day.

183
00:15:02,534 --> 00:15:05,025
- Seven or eight?
- Yes, you do! And you embarrass me...

184
00:15:05,104 --> 00:15:07,629
in front of my secretary
and my associates.

185
00:15:08,641 --> 00:15:10,575
Connie doesn't know
how to handle her because...

186
00:15:10,643 --> 00:15:12,702
halfthe timeyou call,
you're hysterical.

187
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:15,406
I just need to connect with you
during the day, okay?

188
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,006
Just once or twice.
Is that too much to ask?

189
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,883
Just listen to her,Joseph.
Just listen to what she's saying.

190
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:24,480
You gotta be kidding me.

191
00:15:24,556 --> 00:15:26,387
Why areyou so afraid
ofbeing close?

192
00:15:26,458 --> 00:15:28,983
Why in the hell areyou
always focusing on me?

193
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,359
I'm just tryin' to do
myjob, for Christ's sakes...

194
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:36,128
and all we ever do in here is
talk about her problems with me.

195
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,295
What I do, what I don't do,
who I am orwho I'm not...

196
00:15:39,371 --> 00:15:42,033
that she has an issue with.

197
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:55,753
I just-- I can't handle it
when he gets so angry.

198
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:04,758
Joseph,
what is ityou want?

199
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,957
I want a good marriage...

200
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,628
a supportive wife.

201
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:19,044
And I wanna work
all these things out...

202
00:16:19,111 --> 00:16:21,045
so that we can have the baby
that she wants so much.

203
00:16:21,113 --> 00:16:23,513
Joseph, Maria's doing so much
better the past few months.

204
00:16:23,582 --> 00:16:25,675
She's standing up for herself.
It's wonderful.

205
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,480
I know.

206
00:16:27,553 --> 00:16:30,647
But she's still very fragile
with you at this point.

207
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:32,953
This kind of confrontation
can't work.

208
00:16:39,431 --> 00:16:41,422
You're right. I know.

209
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,963
It's just that I feel like I have
to stay on top ofthe situation...

210
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,835
or it'll fall apart.

211
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,767
She'll fall apart.

212
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,055
Hello? Tanner!

213
00:17:06,125 --> 00:17:09,891
No. No, I'll meetyou
at the site.

214
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:42,714
You got a sick patient here,
Alfred. I suggestwe talk in private.

215
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:47,680
Come here, Alfred.
I have a few questions foryou.

216
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:51,120
Joseph, what's going on here now?
You're scaring me.

217
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:53,124
That's good,
'causeyou know what?

218
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,888
I'm not totally in control
of myself right now.

219
00:19:55,961 --> 00:19:58,122
Sit down, Alfred.

220
00:20:09,074 --> 00:20:11,304
What does the name
"Baltazar" mean toyou?

221
00:20:16,782 --> 00:20:18,943
You're gonna tell me everything...

222
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:21,645
and you're gonna start
with this doctor.

223
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:23,984
Doyou know him?
Did you refer her to him?

224
00:20:24,056 --> 00:20:26,957
No, no.
I don't know him.

225
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:30,825
All I know is, he's a sex therapist
that practices on the edge ofthe law.

226
00:20:30,896 --> 00:20:35,424
They tried to shut him down,
but nobodywill testify against him.

227
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,525
Can you tell me
why she does this?

228
00:20:37,603 --> 00:20:40,595
Forget the bullshit psycho-babble.
I need to understand!

229
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:50,072
All I can tell you,Joseph, is that
Maria exhibits most ofthe symptoms...

230
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:53,049
ofwhat is called
a borderline personality.

231
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,616
By that I mean
she has no real identity.

232
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:02,388
She has to look outside ofherself
for assurance, comfort, love.

233
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:07,390
She can find
no sustenance within.

234
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:17,201
- Shouldn't I have been told this?
- Oh, come on,Joseph.

235
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:21,007
You've witnessed this foryears.
I mean, her heightened personality...

236
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:23,513
her need for control
at any cost...

237
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:26,142
the fly obsession,
the phone calls.

238
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,152
Joseph, you lived it.

239
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,248
You're the expert.

240
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:46,093
Most borderlines
are incurable,Joseph.

241
00:21:47,939 --> 00:21:50,601
Theyneed to be
totallyreparented.

242
00:22:03,855 --> 00:22:06,187
One of our construction sites
is on Hinton Street.

243
00:22:15,067 --> 00:22:17,058
I know about Baltazar.

244
00:22:19,104 --> 00:22:21,766
It's not what you think.

245
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,274
Oh, really?
What is it then?

246
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,438
Do you come with Baltazar?
Is that whyyou go?

247
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,606
- To learn how to come?
- It's not about that.

248
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,673
Then what is it about?

249
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:38,280
You know what? You're a lie!
Ourwhole marriage is a lie.

250
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,258
- Fuckyou.
- You wanna tell me why?

251
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,352
I don't feel very close
toyou right now.

252
00:22:44,429 --> 00:22:47,330
You don't feel very close
to me right now?

253
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:49,458
You're paying some guy
to fuckyou...

254
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:52,594
and you don't feel
very close to me right now?

255
00:22:52,671 --> 00:22:55,572
- I'm your husband, for Christ's sakes--
- I don't care whoyou are.

256
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,093
The door is open.

257
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,619
Come in. Sit down.

258
00:24:05,877 --> 00:24:08,971
- Listen--
- Ah, you must beJoseph.

259
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:13,450
I've been expecting you.
Maria's husband.

260
00:24:13,518 --> 00:24:15,509
She's a very special woman.

261
00:24:18,690 --> 00:24:22,148
Look, I don't know whoyou are
orwhatyou thinkyou do...

262
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,560
but I need you to do me a kind favor
and stay away from mywife.

263
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,866
- She's not a well woman.
- I agree.

264
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,062
That's why she came to see me.

265
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,675
Someone would have to be very
disturbed to come here seeking health.

266
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,674
You don't understand,
my friend.

267
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,309
You understand this, Dr. Fuck!

268
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,921
You stay away
from mywife, okay?

269
00:24:51,990 --> 00:24:54,288
I know what goes on in here,
'cause I was here.

270
00:24:54,359 --> 00:24:58,090
And it wasn't love or therapy.
It wasn't even sex!

271
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:00,154
It was sadistic abuse.

272
00:25:04,135 --> 00:25:07,571
I hope I've made myself clear.
It's over. Now.

273
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,979
Cup oftea?

274
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:34,392
I'm a therapist,Joseph.

275
00:25:34,466 --> 00:25:36,593
There's a reason
for everything I do.

276
00:25:39,237 --> 00:25:42,070
Acting out her abuse fantasy
is what enables Maria...

277
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:45,268
to get past the guilt
and anxiety ofbeing intimate.

278
00:25:47,946 --> 00:25:52,679
Ifwe don't express these fantasies,
they run our lives insidiously.

279
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:57,415
When she stops asking for abuse,
her need for it will be gone.

280
00:26:02,961 --> 00:26:06,397
This is insane.
It's insane.

281
00:26:06,464 --> 00:26:08,989
I'm sitting here having tea with
the doctorwho's fucking mywife...

282
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:11,297
and trying to convince me
that it's good for her.

283
00:26:11,369 --> 00:26:15,772
Don'tyou get it, man?
She needs medical help.

284
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,709
Maria's been in traditional therapy
for seven years. Three therapists.

285
00:26:20,779 --> 00:26:23,509
Which therapy doyou think
will work at this point?

286
00:26:31,323 --> 00:26:34,258
Doyou know what
a borderline personality is?

287
00:26:34,326 --> 00:26:37,489
They told you there was no cure,
and theywere right.

288
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:40,895
There is no
psychoanalytic cure.

289
00:26:40,966 --> 00:26:46,199
The mind...
cannot change the mind.

290
00:26:46,271 --> 00:26:48,569
Real change
is not a mental process.

291
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:56,844
Let me guess.
You think sex--

292
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:00,851
your sex, in particular--
will heal Maria, is that it?

293
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,013
Yes and no. I hold
no dominion over my teachings.

294
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:06,057
I only know theywork.

295
00:27:06,124 --> 00:27:10,720
But, yes, conscious sex
that achieves bliss...

296
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,320
is the greatest healer there is.

297
00:27:14,933 --> 00:27:17,128
So the way to heal the woman
is to fuck her?

298
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:22,663
No. Conscious sex, physically
and emotionally integrated...

299
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,301
is one way to heal
a human being.

300
00:27:25,377 --> 00:27:27,368
Ecstasy heals the unconscious.

301
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,107
A woman can heal
a man as well.

302
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:33,673
Well, I hopeyou
don't mind, Doctor...

303
00:27:33,752 --> 00:27:36,186
but I'm gonna try some
other approaches at this point.

304
00:27:36,254 --> 00:27:38,188
I knowyou love Maria,Joseph.

305
00:27:38,256 --> 00:27:40,781
I'm not here
to take that away from you.

306
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,788
Just don't make me
take this any further.

307
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:51,392
I am not the enemy.

308
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,163
I don't know whatyou are.

309
00:31:05,330 --> 00:31:08,322
Oh, hi, sweetheart.
I'm almost done with the kitchen.

310
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:15,002
- What areyou doin'?
- What does it look like I'm doing?

311
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:20,043
The entire house
is infested with bugs.

312
00:31:20,111 --> 00:31:23,740
First I spraywith the Raid
to kill any eggs, and then I seal.

313
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:28,776
Maria, we discussed the fact that
flies do not lay eggs in the house.

314
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:31,481
Ants,Joseph. Ants!

315
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:34,116
The wastebasket was full
ofthem this morning.

316
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,021
Maria, we've gotta talk.

317
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:45,035
Okay.Just let me
finish the kitchen first.

318
00:31:46,037 --> 00:31:48,335
And ifyou wanna help, you can
start cleaning the bathroom.

319
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:50,397
Just go through
your drawers, okay?

320
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:12,559
Hi.

321
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:14,791
What time is it?

322
00:32:17,368 --> 00:32:20,963
It's 5:45 a.m. You busy?

323
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,372
No. No. Of course not.

324
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:27,734
Well, I guess
we'll have some breakfast.

325
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,110
Maria's gettin' worse.

326
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:41,517
I'm sure she's very frightened.

327
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,023
Therapy isn't working.

328
00:32:52,670 --> 00:32:54,831
I wantyou to teach me
whatyou do.

329
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,943
You want to learn from me?

330
00:32:59,010 --> 00:33:01,001
I wanna learn
how to heal mywife.

331
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,471
That's not possible.

332
00:33:10,254 --> 00:33:13,781
You fascinate me.
Firstyou want to destroy me.

333
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:16,019
Nowyou want
to become my acolyte.

334
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:23,228
Doyou play
a musical instrument?

335
00:33:24,435 --> 00:33:25,902
No.

336
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:35,742
Doyou thinkyou have the ability
to put asideyour rage and listen?

337
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,373
Look, the rage is gone, okay?

338
00:33:38,449 --> 00:33:41,577
The only thing that's important
to me now is helping Maria.

339
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,455
Ifl agree to helpyou...

340
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:49,152
you must understand
it means precisely that.

341
00:33:49,227 --> 00:33:53,960
I'm helping you.
Maria has her own path.

342
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,058
I understand.

343
00:33:57,135 --> 00:34:01,333
- I'm not sureyou do.
- And you have to promise me...

344
00:34:01,406 --> 00:34:03,738
thatyou'll never see Maria again.

345
00:34:03,808 --> 00:34:07,801
Ah! Is that whatyou're
really doing here,Joseph?

346
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:11,337
- Preventing me seeing yourwife?
- Dowe have a deal or not?

347
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:16,009
I doubt the rage is gone.

348
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:19,921
But we can put it to good use.

349
00:34:19,991 --> 00:34:22,653
And I agree with you.

350
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:24,718
As I teach you
the ways oflove...

351
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:28,858
it would not be
my place to see Maria.

352
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,138
I saw you at the symphony
the other night.

353
00:34:36,207 --> 00:34:38,835
- I followed you there.
- I'm the substitute.

354
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:42,710
I'd like to play more, but I don't
have the time to devote myself.

355
00:34:43,915 --> 00:34:45,849
So, we have a deal.

356
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:50,047
You can choose to leave at any time,
and I may askyou to leave.

357
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:55,650
But the work and our relationship
must remain strictly confidential.

358
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:11,307
Doyou really
love Maria that much?

359
00:35:18,316 --> 00:35:20,307
Too bad foryou.

360
00:35:22,353 --> 00:35:26,312
Okay, describe to me how
you make love to a woman.

361
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:32,418
And tell me, in detail,
when and how you make love.

362
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,657
Well...

363
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:41,795
one of us starts
kissing the other one...

364
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:43,864
usually at night
before we go to bed.

365
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:51,480
- Then I kiss her breasts for a while.
- How?

366
00:35:51,549 --> 00:35:53,073
How?

367
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:01,652
I kiss.

368
00:36:03,194 --> 00:36:04,684
I suck...

369
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:08,588
twirl my tongue.

370
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:14,030
How does it feel?

371
00:36:14,105 --> 00:36:15,800
Aroused.

372
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,711
Like I want her.

373
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:25,338
Then... kiss her tummy
for a while.

374
00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,987
Turn her over sometimes
and kiss her bottom.

375
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:36,388
- I like to do that.
- How does she feel?

376
00:36:40,631 --> 00:36:42,155
I don't know.

377
00:36:51,742 --> 00:36:56,839
Then I usually kiss her
down there for a while.

378
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,472
Down there?

379
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:00,346
You mean, hervagina?

380
00:37:01,852 --> 00:37:03,444
Yeah?

381
00:37:03,521 --> 00:37:07,685
- Go on.
- And--

382
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:13,397
Sometimes, I use my fingers.

383
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,365
I-- So I can hold herwhile we--

384
00:37:18,603 --> 00:37:20,161
You know.

385
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:31,973
Then I get inside her...

386
00:37:33,284 --> 00:37:35,218
and we make love...

387
00:37:36,954 --> 00:37:38,945
Iike normal, I guess.

388
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,754
Anything else?

389
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,094
Sometimes she cries.

390
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:57,231
Does Maria
ever have an orgasm?

391
00:37:58,309 --> 00:38:00,106
No, I guess not.

392
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:03,635
- Not with me anyway.
- Not with anyone,Joseph.

393
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,978
Maria is frigid.

394
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,981
- Doyou make love toyourself?
- Hmm?

395
00:38:11,055 --> 00:38:16,322
- Doyou masturbate?
- No. No. Not--

396
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,692
Rarelywhen I'm in a relationship.

397
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:21,493
Well, we'll have to change that.

398
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:23,499
How can you make love
to someone else...

399
00:38:23,567 --> 00:38:25,933
ifyou can't make love
toyourself?

400
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:34,439
So,Joseph, what areyou
doing to help Maria?

401
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:37,504
Well, I do what I can, you know.
I try to make her go to therapy--

402
00:38:37,581 --> 00:38:39,845
Only do what I say.

403
00:38:39,917 --> 00:38:43,751
I don't wantyou to make love
to her until I say otherwise.

404
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:48,087
I wantyou to hold her
and talk to her in bed...

405
00:38:48,159 --> 00:38:50,627
about intimate things...

406
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:52,993
the most intimate feelings
you're having.

407
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:58,363
When you sleep, spoon her.

408
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,427
Rightside to the bed.

409
00:39:01,572 --> 00:39:04,905
We call this
the nurturingposition.

410
00:40:00,297 --> 00:40:03,460
Come on in,Joseph.
Go into the room on your left...

411
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:06,002
and take off all your clothes
except your shorts.

412
00:41:10,835 --> 00:41:12,826
Naw, forget it.

413
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:21,835
Come and stand over here.

414
00:41:22,847 --> 00:41:26,908
I want you to look in the mirror
and tell me what you see.

415
00:41:26,984 --> 00:41:29,578
Tell me aboutyour body.

416
00:41:29,653 --> 00:41:31,746
You're jokin', right?

417
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,449
Okay then.
Is this as far as we go?

418
00:41:44,735 --> 00:41:46,794
I guess I'm a bit too thin.

419
00:41:49,707 --> 00:41:51,698
My legs are
definitely too skinny.

420
00:41:55,646 --> 00:41:58,274
I don't know.
It's fine. Why?

421
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:01,841
Well, you stand as if
you don't likeyour body.

422
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,910
I likeyour body.

423
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:05,979
It's lean...

424
00:42:06,056 --> 00:42:07,580
strong.

425
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:12,488
Capable hands,
well-defined feet.

426
00:42:13,931 --> 00:42:15,398
Of course, you could
change it ifyou wanted...

427
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,934
but it's better to change
howyou feel about it.

428
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:23,102
Anyone that doesn't
totally accept their body...

429
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:25,164
can never experience ecstasy...

430
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:30,002
can never enable another
to experience it.

431
00:42:31,582 --> 00:42:34,016
What do you think
about your penis?

432
00:42:38,522 --> 00:42:40,513
Well, to be honest, I like it.

433
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:43,287
It's... Iarge and powerful.

434
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,158
Good. I wantyou
to feel that way.

435
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,494
I'm sure it's true.

436
00:42:48,566 --> 00:42:50,557
Later on, I can
give you some exercises...

437
00:42:50,634 --> 00:42:53,125
to further increase its size.

438
00:42:53,203 --> 00:42:55,194
Good foryou.
Good for Maria.

439
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:59,865
Now, every night
before you go to sleep...

440
00:43:01,111 --> 00:43:03,545
I wantyou to practice
what I call...

441
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,980
"the bliss carezza."

442
00:43:08,786 --> 00:43:11,414
Barelytouching Maria...

443
00:43:11,488 --> 00:43:15,481
tenderlystroke her body
frrom head to toe with your hand.

444
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,690
We are sensitizing her body...

445
00:43:24,068 --> 00:43:26,662
awakening her ecstatic responses.

446
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:32,967
Then, her hand on you.

447
00:43:38,182 --> 00:43:40,241
Imagine lifre energy...

448
00:43:40,317 --> 00:43:42,717
flowing through her hands.

449
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:51,184
Feel the electricity.

450
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,140
I promisedJoseph
I wouldn 't come here.

451
00:44:16,720 --> 00:44:18,711
I don't want to hurt hi m...

452
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:21,147
or us.

453
00:44:25,529 --> 00:44:27,019
I t's just--

454
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:30,590
Sometimes, I get scared.

455
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:42,769
Would you like to dance?

456
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:49,744
I always wanted to be
a ballroom dancer...

457
00:44:49,820 --> 00:44:53,586
you know, the kind
that dons a tux every night and...

458
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:55,648
dances the world.

459
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,921
Did you enjoy the dance?

460
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:38,791
Yes.

461
00:45:38,869 --> 00:45:41,064
As did I.

462
00:45:41,138 --> 00:45:43,129
Very much.

463
00:45:43,807 --> 00:45:46,173
And ifyou enjoy the dance, Maria--

464
00:45:48,545 --> 00:45:51,446
Then the dance is enough.

465
00:45:53,717 --> 00:45:55,207
I promise.

466
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:59,946
Have a cigar.
They're very mild.

467
00:46:00,023 --> 00:46:02,014
- Oh, no. No, thankyou.
- Have one anyway.

468
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,736
Most men fear
women's power,Joseph.

469
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:26,443
A sexually conscious woman
is as powerful as any being on the planet.

470
00:46:28,018 --> 00:46:30,612
We are entering a new era.

471
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:33,349
It will be the resurgence
ofthe divine feminine spirit.

472
00:46:34,691 --> 00:46:36,682
We must honor that spirit...

473
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:39,126
in ourselves...

474
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:41,187
and in others.

475
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:45,497
You have to suck on it
once in a while.

476
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,560
Otherwise, it goes out.

477
00:47:02,119 --> 00:47:05,452
The goal ofsex
is not orgasm,Joseph...

478
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,513
but ecstasy.

479
00:47:09,126 --> 00:47:12,493
Maria's satisfaction
will giveyou ecstasy.

480
00:47:12,563 --> 00:47:14,053
Nothing else.

481
00:47:16,266 --> 00:47:19,394
There are nine levels--
movements, I call them--

482
00:47:19,469 --> 00:47:21,596
to a woman's orgasm.

483
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:25,904
Now, most lovers
only achieve level four--

484
00:47:25,976 --> 00:47:28,410
the ultimate release--

485
00:47:28,478 --> 00:47:30,571
but it's just the threshold.

486
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:33,343
Between movements five and nine...

487
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:35,578
is where true healing occurs.

488
00:47:37,054 --> 00:47:39,522
To reach these movements...

489
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:42,753
you must practice with diligence
the exercises I giveyou.

490
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,817
One oftheir purposes...

491
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:48,524
is to make orgasm
and ejaculation a voluntary act.

492
00:47:48,599 --> 00:47:50,590
I thought
theywere the same thing.

493
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,658
Most people do.

494
00:47:52,736 --> 00:47:56,001
In truth, both orgasm and ejaculation
are governed...

495
00:47:56,073 --> 00:47:59,270
by different
neurological mechanisms.

496
00:48:01,378 --> 00:48:04,609
You must learn to separate
and control each at will.

497
00:48:06,650 --> 00:48:08,641
What doyou mean?

498
00:48:08,719 --> 00:48:11,347
The onlyway to really satisfy
a woman and yourself...

499
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,981
is to have control--

500
00:48:14,057 --> 00:48:17,117
complete control
overyour ejaculation.

501
00:48:19,763 --> 00:48:22,755
Then you are no longer
led around byyour penis.

502
00:48:24,868 --> 00:48:27,860
This has far-reaching implications
in all areas oflife...

503
00:48:27,938 --> 00:48:29,929
don'tyou think?

504
00:48:34,611 --> 00:48:38,570
Well, sir, areyou saying that
I'm never supposed to come?

505
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,640
When you choose.

506
00:48:41,318 --> 00:48:44,048
That way, you don't
dissipateyour life force.

507
00:48:44,121 --> 00:48:46,988
Don'tyou feel tired
afteryou've made love?

508
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:52,155
I will teach you
how to "injaculate..."

509
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:57,192
soyou can have many orgasms
without losing your power.

510
00:48:58,335 --> 00:49:01,395
Yes, I will teach you and Maria...

511
00:49:01,471 --> 00:49:04,269
a greater pleasure
than you imagine possible.

512
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,241
Go on. Let's see howyou do.

513
00:49:28,999 --> 00:49:31,297
I can go a lot further.

514
00:49:31,368 --> 00:49:34,826
I just got
some lungs in mywater.

515
00:49:39,443 --> 00:49:43,607
Okay, using your left hand,
closeyour left nostril...

516
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:47,138
and breathe in through your right nostril
to a count of seven.

517
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:50,549
Then close both nostrils...

518
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:53,316
and hold for a count of 1 4.

519
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,381
Open the left nostril...

520
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,189
and breathe out
through a count of seven.

521
00:49:58,261 --> 00:50:00,627
Close the right nostril...

522
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,723
and hold for a count of 1 4.

523
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,360
Keeping the left nostril open...

524
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:09,337
breathe in to a count of seven.

525
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:11,397
Close both nostrils--

526
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:15,803
Two, three, four, five.

527
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,873
Whywould anybody
wanna do this?

528
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:26,918
Okay,Joseph,
I'm ready to come down.

529
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,151
Joseph, come on.

530
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,991
No sex without condoms.

531
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:41,060
No booze, no drugs.

532
00:50:41,138 --> 00:50:43,129
Nowyou tell me
I can't even come?

533
00:50:45,075 --> 00:50:47,066
I know.
It's depressing, isn't it?

534
00:50:47,144 --> 00:50:48,634
Boy!

535
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:56,875
- Hey.
- Hey.

536
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:58,944
I just have to run an errand.
I'll be right back.

537
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,013
- Okay.
- Doneyour exercises?

538
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,889
Well, I tried, but--

539
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:06,952
I don't know.
I just can't do it.

540
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:10,193
I can't just think of myself.
I need to fantasize.

541
00:51:11,501 --> 00:51:14,959
Go to the white room,Joseph.
Try again.

542
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:17,768
Concentrate
on your own sexual power.

543
00:51:17,841 --> 00:51:19,832
Don't throw it away on fantasy.

544
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:24,614
You don't want me
to take you through them, do you?

545
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,790
Maria remains a mystery..

546
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:23,096
It's hard frorme to determine the roots
ofrhersexual dysfrunction...

547
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:26,336
or the extent
ofrher childhood trauma.

548
00:52:26,409 --> 00:52:29,640
There have, to date,
been no repressed-memory. flashes...

549
00:52:29,713 --> 00:52:31,772
or nightmares...

550
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:36,012
yet she lives in a constant state
ofrsuppressed paranoia.

551
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:41,518
Maria is oddlyprotective
ofrJoseph.

552
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,291
He seems to be a good person--

553
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,660
captured by Maria's
intense passion...

554
00:52:47,731 --> 00:52:51,690
which often springs frorth
to surprise me at any moment...

555
00:52:51,768 --> 00:52:55,135
captured by her beauty
and seductive charms...

556
00:52:55,205 --> 00:52:58,800
and, most likely, captured
by his own need...

557
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:02,902
to suck love frrom those who are
too wounded to give it frreely.

558
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:08,607
I know this man.

559
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,331
Fi nal ly.

560
00:53:25,402 --> 00:53:29,270
Hera:
Trials ofrthe Goddess Obscura.

561
00:53:29,339 --> 00:53:32,433
Fi rst publ ished i n 1 908.

562
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:34,841
I t's been out of pri nt
si nce 1 93 2.

563
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:38,480
You have yet
to let me down, Eva.

564
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:43,080
I find the combination
of charm and intelligence...

565
00:53:44,354 --> 00:53:47,016
a rare union these days.

566
00:53:53,830 --> 00:53:56,196
Maria will take time.

567
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:59,963
She is in the darkness
befrore selfr-realization.

568
00:54:00,036 --> 00:54:02,027
She needs to freel frree...

569
00:54:02,105 --> 00:54:05,131
to express herselfrin ways
she cannot with her husband.

570
00:54:05,208 --> 00:54:07,199
She needs to be released
frrom the burdens...

571
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,336
ofrher shame and selfr-hatred.

572
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:12,538
I wi I l try.

573
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:23,121
How are the exercises goi ng?

574
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:27,352
Fi ne.

575
00:54:28,465 --> 00:54:30,456
Everything's going fine.

576
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,558
I want you to do them
three times a day.

577
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:35,461
Draw the energy
up to the heart chakra...

578
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:38,371
and then progress to the third eye,
as we discussed.

579
00:54:39,776 --> 00:54:42,210
I work all day.

580
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:45,337
Then I suggest you close your door.

581
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,441
Can you explain it to me?

582
00:54:50,520 --> 00:54:54,456
Well,Joseph, you know,
the construction supervisor...

583
00:54:54,524 --> 00:54:58,483
is talking about chakras,
reads books about Hinduism.

584
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,927
MyJoseph
is talking about chakras.

585
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:03,124
I think thatJoseph's discovery
that his relationshipwith you...

586
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,032
is notwhat he thought itwas
has had a profound effect on him.

587
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,560
It's like... he has this inner life
that I--

588
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,933
What?

589
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,237
Nothing.

590
00:55:18,315 --> 00:55:20,715
I just had a bizarre thought.

591
00:55:25,021 --> 00:55:27,251
Anyway...

592
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,724
Iast night, we just...

593
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:33,285
sat in bed and talked...

594
00:55:33,363 --> 00:55:35,354
sort of.

595
00:55:36,166 --> 00:55:37,861
Tell me.

596
00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:40,061
I can't. I can't.

597
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,031
Okay.

598
00:55:49,245 --> 00:55:51,236
He sat me down
in front of a mirror...

599
00:55:51,314 --> 00:55:53,407
and he asked me
to masturbate for him.

600
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:57,849
He wanted me to show him
step-by-step...

601
00:55:57,921 --> 00:55:59,912
how I like to be touched.

602
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:03,415
He wanted to know
how to please me.

603
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,519
How did that feel?

604
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:10,157
I wouldn't do it at first.
I was too embarrassed.

605
00:56:12,001 --> 00:56:13,992
Then he did it.

606
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:20,467
I learned so much about him
bywatching him...

607
00:56:22,746 --> 00:56:24,737
how he touched himself.

608
00:56:27,617 --> 00:56:29,608
Then I did it.

609
00:56:32,088 --> 00:56:34,613
Doyou feel you got closer
to an orgasm?

610
00:56:35,358 --> 00:56:38,850
Oh, God, no!
I was far too self-conscious.

611
00:56:38,928 --> 00:56:40,919
But this is good.

612
00:56:44,100 --> 00:56:46,330
Before we end, though, Maria,
I would like to encourageyou...

613
00:56:46,403 --> 00:56:48,428
to return to therapy
with a greater commitment.

614
00:56:48,505 --> 00:56:50,496
I don't know.

615
00:56:52,675 --> 00:56:55,371
I worry too much
when I seeyou.

616
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:59,279
- I try to control my thoughts.
- We are what we think, Maria.

617
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:02,682
Life is learning to come to terms
with our thoughts.

618
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,744
The terms of my thoughts
are unreasonable, Alfred.

619
00:57:08,057 --> 00:57:10,218
It's just as well
I leave them alone.

620
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:12,195
Start by using
your ring finger.

621
00:57:12,195 --> 00:57:15,631
Start by using
your ring finger.

622
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:18,826
Slip it in gently
and curl it...

623
00:57:18,902 --> 00:57:22,861
soyour fingertip is touching
the ceiling oftheyoni.

624
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,998
Go as deep as you can.

625
00:57:25,074 --> 00:57:27,702
Then slideyourfinger down
until you feel it.

626
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:33,713
- Howwill I know?
- Most likely, she'll tell you.

627
00:57:33,783 --> 00:57:35,774
She'll feel it ifyou don't.

628
00:57:37,487 --> 00:57:39,921
When you find the sacred spot...

629
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:42,219
never break eye contact
with Maria.

630
00:57:47,564 --> 00:57:49,555
Does it hurt?

631
00:57:50,567 --> 00:57:53,502
- It's just sensitive.
- Is it too much?

632
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:58,664
It feels raw...

633
00:57:59,943 --> 00:58:01,934
almost like it's burning.

634
00:58:06,216 --> 00:58:09,208
The first few times
the sacred spot is touched...

635
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,578
it can be frightening.

636
00:58:12,655 --> 00:58:14,885
She may experience pain.

637
00:58:14,958 --> 00:58:17,552
I'm scared,Joseph.

638
00:58:17,627 --> 00:58:19,117
It's okay.

639
00:58:19,195 --> 00:58:21,493
Just keep stroking.

640
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:24,362
The sensation will change.

641
00:58:31,307 --> 00:58:33,935
Staywith me, okay?

642
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,911
- I loveyou.
- I loveyou too.

643
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:50,289
Staywith her for only
30 seconds or so...

644
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,590
and then slowlywithdraw...

645
00:58:52,662 --> 00:58:55,290
but hold hervery closely.

646
00:58:56,199 --> 00:59:00,295
You are assuming the role ofhealer
in this act,Joseph.

647
00:59:01,504 --> 00:59:04,564
All Maria's abuse
and psychic hurts...

648
00:59:04,641 --> 00:59:06,768
reside in this sacred spot.

649
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:09,735
Itwill take time
to release them.

650
01:00:49,512 --> 01:00:51,503
A bit late,
aren'tyou,Joseph?

651
01:00:53,216 --> 01:00:55,912
I feel it, you know,
whatyou've been talking about.

652
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:59,011
I've been doing the exercises,
and I feel it.

653
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:02,614
Describe this feeling.

654
01:01:04,794 --> 01:01:07,627
It's like this, you know, this sadness
that I've been carrying around...

655
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:09,790
has just, you know--
It's lifted.

656
01:01:09,866 --> 01:01:12,801
And I feel--
I just feel the love.

657
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:16,066
I feel in love with myself.

658
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:31,579
So, what's on for today?

659
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:34,122
Nothing's on for today,Joseph.

660
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,181
I have a very busy evening--

661
01:01:36,259 --> 01:01:38,921
a performance and a date.

662
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,425
You have a date?

663
01:01:42,231 --> 01:01:43,721
Indeed.

664
01:01:43,800 --> 01:01:45,665
And so do you.

665
01:01:46,402 --> 01:01:48,393
It's time foryou and Maria
to make love.

666
01:01:53,976 --> 01:01:56,103
Now remember...

667
01:01:56,179 --> 01:01:58,306
make love from the heart...

668
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,372
nowhere else.

669
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,940
Keepyour eyes open...

670
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,611
move extremely slowly...

671
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,746
and, most importantly...

672
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:11,521
with love and adoration.

673
01:02:13,463 --> 01:02:16,125
What about
the nine levels of orgasm?

674
01:02:16,199 --> 01:02:19,362
Later. Don't concern yourself
with orgasm.

675
01:02:19,435 --> 01:02:22,836
For Maria, it will take much time.

676
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,271
Foryou, it's forbidden.

677
01:02:35,818 --> 01:02:37,809
I feel the love.

678
01:02:40,189 --> 01:02:42,521
I love myself.

679
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,719
- I love myself.
- Congratulations, buddy.

680
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,891
I love myselfthree times a day.

681
01:02:49,966 --> 01:02:51,957
I feel the love.

682
01:03:13,856 --> 01:03:16,484
Okay. I'll talk to you later.
Bye.

683
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:40,506
- Hello.
- What's so funny?

684
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:44,410
How did you know
I was laughing?

685
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:49,658
I just know.

686
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:51,886
I've been learning more...

687
01:03:51,961 --> 01:03:54,361
and more aboutyou
every day.

688
01:03:56,532 --> 01:03:58,523
So I see.

689
01:04:00,069 --> 01:04:02,799
- When areyou coming home?
- Soon.

690
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,664
When I do...

691
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:07,732
do you wanna make love?

692
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:14,975
I thought
you wanted to wait.

693
01:04:17,553 --> 01:04:20,716
I mean,
areyou sureyou're ready?

694
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:29,654
Under one condition.

695
01:04:32,301 --> 01:04:33,791
What's that?

696
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:36,795
We do it myway.

697
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:43,170
Hon, maybe we should just, you know,
hold each other first.

698
01:04:43,246 --> 01:04:44,736
Shut up.

699
01:05:00,930 --> 01:05:03,626
Why areyou doing this?

700
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,690
'Cause I loveyour toes...

701
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:09,094
and it excites me.

702
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:25,343
Don't move.

703
01:05:35,531 --> 01:05:37,431
- Hon!
- Huh?

704
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,666
It hurts.

705
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:29,674
I loveyou
so deep inside me,Joseph.

706
01:06:32,588 --> 01:06:36,217
Oh, God, I feel you so--
so deep inside.

707
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:46,992
Not so fast.

708
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:51,330
- I'm not supposed to come.
- Huh?

709
01:06:51,407 --> 01:06:52,806
- I'm not supposed to--
- What?

710
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:55,036
- I'm not supposed to--
- I can't hearyou.

711
01:06:55,111 --> 01:06:57,102
- Don't make me come.
- Why?

712
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,320
Too bad, motherfucker.

713
01:07:33,215 --> 01:07:35,206
Did you like it?

714
01:07:36,419 --> 01:07:38,979
I guess she surprised us, huh?

715
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,046
Yeah.

716
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:43,114
I felt--

717
01:07:43,192 --> 01:07:44,682
Scared?

718
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:49,755
A woman's anger
can be very scary.

719
01:07:49,832 --> 01:07:52,596
Most don't feel they have
the right to express it.

720
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:58,367
Maybe we should encourage Maria
to vent hers more often.

721
01:07:58,441 --> 01:08:00,568
- In bed?
- Why not?

722
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:06,208
Repressed anger...

723
01:08:06,282 --> 01:08:09,149
chokes us, closes us down.

724
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:17,321
Are you sure it was
Maria's anger that scared you?

725
01:08:17,393 --> 01:08:19,418
What do you mean?

726
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:21,486
How did it feel
to be fucked?

727
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,567
Out of control.

728
01:08:25,634 --> 01:08:27,625
How did you feel?

729
01:08:31,207 --> 01:08:32,697
Fear.

730
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,914
I was over on Hinton Street
the other day.

731
01:09:02,972 --> 01:09:04,963
Does he make you feel safe?

732
01:09:15,751 --> 01:09:17,742
Does he love you no matterwhat?

733
01:09:24,193 --> 01:09:26,184
So do I.

734
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:34,925
Follow closely.

735
01:09:36,772 --> 01:09:38,763
Let me into your subconscious.

736
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:08,226
Touch her like a harmonic--

737
01:10:08,304 --> 01:10:10,295
gently, yin...

738
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,215
but sure, definitive.

739
01:10:32,561 --> 01:10:34,552
It's nice, huh?

740
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:03,748
Look at me.

741
01:11:05,127 --> 01:11:06,617
Look at me.

742
01:13:00,943 --> 01:13:04,037
Nowmovements frive to nine.

743
01:13:05,347 --> 01:13:07,577
Support herneck
withyourhand...

744
01:13:07,649 --> 01:13:10,982
preciselyat the frourth and frifth
cervical vertebrae.

745
01:13:13,322 --> 01:13:16,382
Begin your toning
and breathe into her neck...

746
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:18,449
through your hand.

747
01:13:19,995 --> 01:13:22,964
Energy frollows consciousness.

748
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:47,011
Are you okay?

749
01:13:47,089 --> 01:13:49,557
Hon? Hon!

750
01:13:52,895 --> 01:13:54,385
Honey?

751
01:14:52,421 --> 01:14:54,412
Yes, I 'm J oseph.

752
01:14:55,691 --> 01:14:59,422
- Do you mind if my friends--
- Anyone you want.

753
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:04,732
Okay. When Maria
first arrived...

754
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,394
her throat
was almost swollen shut.

755
01:15:07,469 --> 01:15:10,336
We injected the throat
with a strong anti-inflammatory.

756
01:15:10,405 --> 01:15:13,238
We also administered her a sedative
so she would rest.

757
01:15:15,444 --> 01:15:17,469
Now, toyour knowledge...

758
01:15:17,546 --> 01:15:20,709
has anything like this
ever happened before?

759
01:15:20,782 --> 01:15:22,773
Is she allergic to anything?

760
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:25,649
- Any medication she might have taken?
- Not that I know of.

761
01:15:25,721 --> 01:15:29,248
What wereyou doing
when this occurred?

762
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,786
We were making love...

763
01:15:36,098 --> 01:15:38,293
and she started crying...

764
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:41,566
and then she started choking.

765
01:15:41,637 --> 01:15:44,401
She's been under a lot
of abnormal stress lately.

766
01:15:45,741 --> 01:15:48,141
She had a severe breakdown.

767
01:15:48,210 --> 01:15:50,405
She had a body memory.

768
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:54,142
Maria has endured some form
of repeated child abuse.

769
01:15:54,216 --> 01:15:56,480
She shows almost all
the external symptoms...

770
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:58,577
but it's locked
in her subconscious.

771
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,356
Now she can begin
the road to recovery.

772
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:04,415
That's possible.

773
01:16:04,493 --> 01:16:08,054
Her memory could've triggered
a spontaneous regression to some incident.

774
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:11,622
Oral sex is one ofthe most common
forms ofinfant abuse.

775
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:19,393
It's more about acceptance
than forgiveness for me.

776
01:17:21,069 --> 01:17:23,060
I got a letter a year later.

777
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:26,805
Now she denies
that anything ever happened.

778
01:17:29,478 --> 01:17:30,968
That's all.

779
01:17:41,923 --> 01:17:44,391
My name is Maria...

780
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:49,158
and I'm a survivor
of child sexual abuse and incest.

781
01:17:54,636 --> 01:17:56,126
- Hey.
- Hi.

782
01:17:56,204 --> 01:17:58,195
It's Maria's mother on the phone.

783
01:18:06,114 --> 01:18:08,105
Hello, Dottie?

784
01:18:12,888 --> 01:18:16,881
I support her, and I am doing
as best as I can...

785
01:18:16,958 --> 01:18:19,085
as her husband
in this situation...

786
01:18:19,161 --> 01:18:21,527
but does it really matter
what I think?

787
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:26,495
I realize thatyou think she's ill.
She is getting help.

788
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:37,069
Because I've seen her suffer.

789
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,905
Well, I'm sorry, too, Dottie.

790
01:19:00,302 --> 01:19:02,600
- Honey, it's the fifth time todayyou've taken--
- Leave me alone.

791
01:19:03,839 --> 01:19:05,864
We have to talk
about this, Maria.

792
01:19:07,275 --> 01:19:09,300
I just needed a shower.

793
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:23,315
The other night, when you got up
to go to the bathroom...

794
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:25,723
I knew it was you...

795
01:19:25,794 --> 01:19:29,525
but what I saw was him
standing there...

796
01:19:32,000 --> 01:19:34,298
naked...

797
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,360
ready to come to my bed.

798
01:19:38,373 --> 01:19:42,469
We need to separate,Joseph.
I know I'm going crazy.

799
01:19:42,544 --> 01:19:45,172
You have to let me inside.

800
01:19:45,247 --> 01:19:47,238
You have to let me
try to helpyou.

801
01:19:47,315 --> 01:19:49,374
I don't feel comfortable
around you.

802
01:19:49,451 --> 01:19:52,614
- The things thatyou do frighten me.
-Just tell me what I can do.

803
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:55,622
When you touch me,
I feel numb.

804
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:06,290
I'm gonna sleep in the guest bedroom
until you find another place to stay.

805
01:20:26,021 --> 01:20:29,821
Living room, bar, kitchen--
ifyou wanna call it that.

806
01:20:29,891 --> 01:20:31,381
Closets.

807
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:34,917
Clean towels, fresh linens
every other day.

808
01:20:34,996 --> 01:20:36,486
Any questions?

809
01:21:04,793 --> 01:21:07,660
Notyour most confident stride,
Joseph.

810
01:21:15,804 --> 01:21:17,829
Maria asked you to leave.

811
01:21:21,509 --> 01:21:23,943
Listen, ifyou know everything
that's gonna happen in my life...

812
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:25,843
for the next twoyears,
why don't you let me know...

813
01:21:25,914 --> 01:21:28,849
so I can plan myvacations and know
when to put my house on the market.

814
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:33,317
Tell me what happened.

815
01:21:48,436 --> 01:21:50,529
It's what Maria's going through.

816
01:21:52,807 --> 01:21:55,970
What has to do with you...

817
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:58,342
has to do with you.

818
01:22:03,151 --> 01:22:05,142
What's that supposed to mean?

819
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:10,249
You married a scarred and
emotionally dysfunctional woman.

820
01:22:11,493 --> 01:22:14,291
Has it ever occurred toyou
to askyourselfwhy?

821
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:18,230
Whyyou put up with so much
in return for so little?

822
01:22:18,300 --> 01:22:21,167
Because I'm in love
with her, okay?

823
01:22:21,236 --> 01:22:25,263
And because I believed in you.
I believed that we could help her!

824
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:29,504
Our relationship has never
been about Maria. Never.

825
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:33,479
You don't love Maria,Joseph.
You want to mold her.

826
01:22:33,548 --> 01:22:35,914
You want to make her
something forJoseph.

827
01:22:35,984 --> 01:22:38,418
And you've only ever
proven to me...

828
01:22:38,486 --> 01:22:40,454
thatyou'd do anything
to make that happen.

829
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:42,956
What doyou know
about love? Huh?

830
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:48,928
Love is being there when
they hateyour fucking guts!

831
01:22:48,997 --> 01:22:50,828
Love is being there
when they bleed.

832
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:56,264
Haveyou ever been with a woman
for more than one hour? Ever?

833
01:23:08,750 --> 01:23:12,811
Wendy takes small steps every day
to make herself attractive.

834
01:23:12,887 --> 01:23:16,550
She eats. Then she eliminates
through the esophagus, mind you.

835
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:19,286
That's when she's not taking
the latest laxative on the market.

836
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:22,930
A beautiful woman, Leslie.

837
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:27,901
God made her 5'5"
and a voluptuous 1 28 pounds.

838
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:30,460
But sometime, probably
when she was a teenager...

839
01:23:30,538 --> 01:23:33,029
she got the idea that
she wasn't so beautiful.

840
01:23:33,108 --> 01:23:35,303
Maybe it was because her friends,
Debbie and Connie...

841
01:23:35,377 --> 01:23:37,311
were getting all the boys.

842
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:39,973
But she started a program
of repetitive surgery...

843
01:23:40,048 --> 01:23:42,380
to suck all the fat
from her body.

844
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:45,510
She started with her hips,
her thighs, her tummy.

845
01:23:45,587 --> 01:23:48,613
Next month, unless
we do something to help her...

846
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:50,715
she'll continue with
her arms and her ankles.

847
01:23:50,792 --> 01:23:52,282
They always do.

848
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:57,962
Candy's had four implants.
She just can't get it quite right.

849
01:23:59,667 --> 01:24:03,398
Evelyn injects her face
with cow fat six times a year.

850
01:24:04,472 --> 01:24:07,134
Jane: Two hours
on the StairMaster...

851
01:24:07,208 --> 01:24:09,676
an hour on a treadmill, daily.

852
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:15,479
They dress to flaunt this,
to hide that.

853
01:24:15,550 --> 01:24:17,916
They cover their faces
with poisons.

854
01:24:17,986 --> 01:24:22,548
You're right. They do bleed,Joseph.
And doyou know why?

855
01:24:23,992 --> 01:24:28,053
Because they're desperate
to sell what men buy.

856
01:24:28,129 --> 01:24:32,190
Desperate to be what
they're not, to be loved.

857
01:24:32,267 --> 01:24:33,928
Like Maria.

858
01:24:35,703 --> 01:24:40,572
Have you ever thought
that maybe your focus on Maria...

859
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:44,373
is a distraction from
your own fear of abandonment?

860
01:24:46,514 --> 01:24:50,041
Your own emptiness?
Your own life?

861
01:24:52,620 --> 01:24:56,078
You want to be a healer?
Heal yourself.

862
01:25:18,346 --> 01:25:21,008
This'll be painless.
I promise.

863
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:24,779
- You're a deceptive asshole.
- All you gotta do is meet her.

864
01:25:24,853 --> 01:25:27,549
She just got divorced.
She was married for twoyears.

865
01:25:27,622 --> 01:25:29,613
You guys got a lot in common.

866
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:33,685
Now she's
a little bit flat upstairs...

867
01:25:33,761 --> 01:25:36,229
but Nancy tells me
she has a bodacious ass...

868
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:38,288
and is not afraid to use it.

869
01:25:39,767 --> 01:25:43,328
Tanner, do me a favor, okay?

870
01:25:43,404 --> 01:25:45,702
Never talk to me about a woman
like that again.

871
01:25:48,676 --> 01:25:50,667
What is wrong with you?

872
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:08,929
Joseph, areyou with me?

873
01:26:08,997 --> 01:26:11,830
Hmm? Yeah. Sorry.

874
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:15,700
Okay. Arthurwants you to take
a meeting with the Kensor group.

875
01:26:15,770 --> 01:26:17,294
Will you do it?

876
01:26:18,540 --> 01:26:20,531
No. You know what?

877
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:23,270
Cancel my 2:30 meeting
with Cruise, too, would you?

878
01:26:24,312 --> 01:26:26,803
- Whereyou going?
- Goin' out for a while.

879
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:16,019
Hello?

880
01:27:18,299 --> 01:27:20,233
Yes, Doctor.

881
01:27:21,803 --> 01:27:23,862
No. No, I'll be there.

882
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:27,574
3:00 Tuesday?

883
01:27:29,077 --> 01:27:32,103
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, I understand.

884
01:27:39,220 --> 01:27:42,155
Theydon't want to be alone
in theirhealing anymore.

885
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:45,681
Theywantyou to understand,
to be aware...

886
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,922
and to hear them.

887
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:52,763
Beyond that, there are
no expectations.

888
01:27:54,235 --> 01:27:56,169
Are there any questions?

889
01:28:01,576 --> 01:28:04,670
Okay. Who would like
to go first?

890
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:08,114
I would.

891
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:17,521
My name is Maria...

892
01:28:18,526 --> 01:28:21,359
and my husband is Joseph.

893
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:32,366
From the time I was a baby...

894
01:28:32,440 --> 01:28:35,204
until I was about
ten years old...

895
01:28:35,276 --> 01:28:38,712
I loved my father
more than anything else.

896
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:41,772
Nobody could say anything bad
about him to me.

897
01:28:41,849 --> 01:28:44,181
The world loved him too.

898
01:28:48,089 --> 01:28:51,718
I have recently remembered
a lot ofthings.

899
01:28:54,595 --> 01:28:57,655
I remembered that
my father's favorite thing...

900
01:28:57,732 --> 01:29:00,701
was to kiss myvagina
when I was a baby.

901
01:29:02,970 --> 01:29:06,963
I remember I'd wake up in the middle
ofthe night sucking his penis.

902
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,335
I didn't even know
what it was.

903
01:29:14,882 --> 01:29:17,851
My motherwent away on a trip
when I was fiveyears old.

904
01:29:20,254 --> 01:29:23,018
This was the first time
he put his penis in me.

905
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:26,616
I bled for days.

906
01:29:29,697 --> 01:29:33,133
He told me that's what
daddies and little girls do--

907
01:29:34,635 --> 01:29:36,569
that it was our secret.

908
01:29:38,573 --> 01:29:42,509
He made me believe that every father
did that with their daughter.

909
01:29:45,213 --> 01:29:47,147
So I believed him...

910
01:29:53,020 --> 01:29:55,011
and I became that.

911
01:29:58,493 --> 01:30:00,484
And I enjoyed it too.

912
01:30:04,165 --> 01:30:06,759
It seemed to stop
when I was about 1 1 or 1 2.

913
01:30:06,834 --> 01:30:09,166
I don't know why...

914
01:30:10,471 --> 01:30:12,462
but I still loved him.

915
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:15,465
I had no choice.

916
01:30:17,145 --> 01:30:19,636
I became the woman that
my fatherwanted me to be.

917
01:30:19,714 --> 01:30:21,648
I dressed how
he told me to dress.

918
01:30:21,716 --> 01:30:25,812
I presented myself
as a happy, bubbly girl.

919
01:30:28,823 --> 01:30:30,518
Still do.

920
01:30:33,027 --> 01:30:35,495
It's the way
that I block the feelings.

921
01:30:37,799 --> 01:30:40,324
It's the way
that I block the pain.

922
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:52,640
I know I've been away
a long time.

923
01:30:56,150 --> 01:30:59,085
I had to confront my self-hatred...

924
01:30:59,153 --> 01:31:01,644
and I am terrified ofyou...

925
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:07,761
but it's because
you make me feel so good...

926
01:31:09,497 --> 01:31:11,488
Iike my father did.

927
01:31:12,633 --> 01:31:17,570
My father, who was supposed to
keep me safe from harm, was the harm.

928
01:31:20,608 --> 01:31:22,542
Can you understand?

929
01:31:28,549 --> 01:31:30,346
Do you?

930
01:31:39,293 --> 01:31:41,784
Look at the courage she has.

931
01:31:41,863 --> 01:31:46,061
So many people go
the otherway, live as victims.

932
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:51,965
They use their abuse as an excuse
to close down, to give in to life.

933
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:55,408
How do you let it go?

934
01:31:56,511 --> 01:31:58,979
You look it straight
in the eye...

935
01:31:59,046 --> 01:32:01,537
and risk letting someone loveyou.

936
01:32:02,583 --> 01:32:04,574
Maria did that today.

937
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:12,085
She's gonna be a different woman
when she gets through this.

938
01:32:14,529 --> 01:32:16,463
Yes.

939
01:32:32,179 --> 01:32:36,946
You know, it's not good foryou
to have so many orgasms.

940
01:32:37,018 --> 01:32:39,009
You need to learn
to preserve youryang...

941
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:41,020
and prolong your sexual activity.

942
01:32:41,088 --> 01:32:43,989
Good foryou.
Good foryourwife.

943
01:32:44,058 --> 01:32:47,960
- Okay. Thanks.
- Sure.

944
01:33:09,684 --> 01:33:13,051
I know.
I feel the same. Yeah.

945
01:33:14,522 --> 01:33:17,821
That sounds good. Okay.

946
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:20,326
Right. Yeah.

947
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,014
- Hi.
- Hi.

948
01:33:48,923 --> 01:33:51,153
Do you want
to have a seat?

949
01:33:51,225 --> 01:33:52,715
Sure.

950
01:34:02,903 --> 01:34:04,894
Doyou want to play
"Ifyou love me"?

951
01:34:09,176 --> 01:34:10,666
Okay.

952
01:34:14,115 --> 01:34:15,707
Okay.

953
01:34:20,154 --> 01:34:22,145
Ifyou love me...

954
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:25,785
you'll understand
that I needed time...

955
01:34:26,861 --> 01:34:29,352
to separateyou from my abuse.

956
01:34:33,501 --> 01:34:36,231
I still wake up every morning
with my memories--

957
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:40,668
my nightmares--

958
01:34:41,942 --> 01:34:43,807
but I'm facing them.

959
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,941
I can't help feeling ugly...

960
01:34:50,251 --> 01:34:52,481
and ashamed.

961
01:35:00,261 --> 01:35:02,195
Ifyou love me...

962
01:35:04,265 --> 01:35:06,256
Iet me come home.

963
01:35:43,804 --> 01:35:45,601
- Hi.
- Hi.

964
01:35:45,673 --> 01:35:47,368
I'm Eva.

965
01:35:48,375 --> 01:35:50,036
Areyou here
for a violin lesson?

966
01:35:51,112 --> 01:35:53,103
No-- Yes. Yes, yes, I am.

967
01:35:56,217 --> 01:36:00,347
I think I've got the wrong time,
so I'd probably betterjust--

968
01:36:02,757 --> 01:36:04,884
Eva, this is Joseph.

969
01:36:06,794 --> 01:36:08,284
We met.

970
01:36:09,296 --> 01:36:10,593
Bye, lover.

971
01:36:17,805 --> 01:36:19,898
I'll seeyou Friday...

972
01:36:19,974 --> 01:36:22,568
unless you want
to drop by the library.

973
01:36:27,681 --> 01:36:29,546
Good night,Joseph.

974
01:36:37,725 --> 01:36:39,750
- Client?
- No.

975
01:36:41,328 --> 01:36:44,263
That's the healing room.
This is my bedroom.

976
01:36:48,936 --> 01:36:50,631
A violin lesson, huh?

977
01:36:50,704 --> 01:36:52,638
Yes-- No.

978
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:58,337
I haven't exactly told her
what I do. I--

979
01:36:59,513 --> 01:37:01,504
I need a bit more time.

980
01:37:06,954 --> 01:37:09,286
Isn't she glorious?

981
01:37:09,356 --> 01:37:11,984
And you don't have to heal her?

982
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:16,787
Doyou--

983
01:37:16,864 --> 01:37:19,890
Doyou ever smell her fragrance
when she's nowhere around?

984
01:37:21,302 --> 01:37:22,963
And doyou--

985
01:37:24,071 --> 01:37:27,563
Doyou know what she's thinking
before she even begins to tell you?

986
01:37:29,043 --> 01:37:31,102
Doyou dread all the moments
in between?

987
01:37:39,954 --> 01:37:41,353
Too bad foryou.
