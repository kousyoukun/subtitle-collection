1
00:03:06,142 --> 00:03:08,188
Fuck!

2
00:03:34,257 --> 00:03:36,303
<i>Name three objects
in this room.</i>

3
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:39,088
Chair, lamp, clock.

4
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,180
Three objects
not in this room.

5
00:03:44,311 --> 00:03:46,138
Whisky bottle,
airplane, racehorse.

6
00:03:46,269 --> 00:03:48,489
Fuck.

7
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:51,100
Today's date.
- Thursday.

8
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,841
The date,
not the day of the week,

9
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:55,235
Um...

10
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,283
September. Sep...

11
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,852
How about the year?

12
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:09,814
<i>What's your city of birth?</i>

13
00:04:12,774 --> 00:04:15,255
<i>Do you remember
your mother's name?</i>

14
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:24,351
<i>How about your father?</i>

15
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:10,571
<i>This is an
experimental procedure.</i>

16
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:12,224
<i>Electrodes will send impulses</i>

17
00:05:12,355 --> 00:05:13,704
<i>to the target areas
in your brain.</i>

18
00:05:16,359 --> 00:05:18,187
<i>New neural pathways
should develop,</i>

19
00:05:18,883 --> 00:05:21,321
but the results can be
a little less predictable,

20
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:24,106
especially given your history
of substance abuse,

21
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:26,282
a common trigger
for Alzheimer's.

22
00:05:44,953 --> 00:05:46,258
Hello.

23
00:05:46,389 --> 00:05:48,435
<i>Is this Roy Freeman?</i>

24
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:55,442
<i>Hello?</i>

25
00:05:56,268 --> 00:05:58,662
Yeah.
<i>Um, my name is Emily Dietz.</i>

26
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,534
<i>I work with
the Clean Hands Project.</i>

27
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,667
Clean Hands Project?

28
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:04,973
<i>Yes!</i>

29
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:06,714
<i>We are a legal action
nonprofit</i>

30
00:06:06,844 --> 00:06:08,237
<i>and we advocate for inmates</i>

31
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:09,847
<i>who have been disenfranchised
by the system.</i>

32
00:06:09,978 --> 00:06:11,283
Okay.

33
00:06:11,414 --> 00:06:13,024
<i>Would you have a few minutes
to speak?</i>

34
00:06:14,765 --> 00:06:15,984
Yeah.

35
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:18,073
What's this about?

36
00:06:18,203 --> 00:06:20,815
<i>It's... regarding
an old case of yours.</i>

37
00:06:41,009 --> 00:06:42,924
Emily Dietz.

38
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:46,536
Mr. Freeman?
- Ms. Dietz.

39
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:48,669
Oh. Hi.

40
00:06:48,799 --> 00:06:50,410
- Emily.
- Emily.

41
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,281
I really appreciate you
meeting with me.

42
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:54,022
No problem.

43
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:56,459
You said it was about,
uh, an old case, huh?

44
00:06:56,590 --> 00:06:59,070
Yes, sir. Isaac Samuel.

45
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:04,815
Isaac Samuel?

46
00:07:04,946 --> 00:07:07,731
Um... I... I'm sorry.
I-I don't, uh...

47
00:07:07,862 --> 00:07:08,819
Oh. Of course.

48
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,212
I'm sure you've seen
more cases

49
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:11,474
than you care to remember.

50
00:07:11,605 --> 00:07:13,911
Yeah. Something like that.

51
00:07:15,783 --> 00:07:17,872
He was convicted
in the Joseph Wieder murder

52
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:20,004
at Waterford College
ten years ago

53
00:07:20,135 --> 00:07:21,353
and is scheduled
to be executed

54
00:07:21,484 --> 00:07:22,833
end of next month.

55
00:07:22,964 --> 00:07:24,487
We've tried to get a stay
from the governor,

56
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:25,880
but it's not looking good.

57
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,272
Okay.

58
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:29,840
I don't recognize him.

59
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:31,886
What's he got to do with me?

60
00:07:32,016 --> 00:07:34,192
Mr. Samuel requested to speak
with the detectives

61
00:07:34,323 --> 00:07:36,673
who had interrogated him
the night of his confession.

62
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,196
I interrogated him?

63
00:07:38,327 --> 00:07:41,112
And I have yet to locate
your former partner.

64
00:07:42,766 --> 00:07:44,246
What does he want
to talk about?

65
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,161
I'm afraid he didn't say.

66
00:07:46,291 --> 00:07:48,946
That's something that you
will have to ask him yourself.

67
00:10:16,093 --> 00:10:17,181
Isaac Samuel?

68
00:10:21,316 --> 00:10:22,447
Yeah.

69
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:29,672
I'm Roy Freeman.
I used to be a detective.

70
00:10:30,717 --> 00:10:32,283
I've been told
you wanted to see me.

71
00:10:32,414 --> 00:10:34,677
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

72
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,811
Okay.

73
00:10:39,116 --> 00:10:40,857
Well, here I am.

74
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:44,165
How are you doing?

75
00:10:44,295 --> 00:10:48,125
Oh, you know,
I'm blessed, Roy.

76
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,911
Ten years,
three hots and a cot,

77
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,826
member of
the death row book club.

78
00:10:52,956 --> 00:10:55,611
Prison got my body,
but Allah got my spirit.

79
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:58,179
Like you give a fuck
how I'm doing.

80
00:10:59,267 --> 00:11:00,485
I see.

81
00:11:02,226 --> 00:11:05,969
So, this lady,
uh... Emily Dietz,

82
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,797
from the Clean Hands Project,

83
00:11:07,928 --> 00:11:09,494
she told me you wanted
to talk to me.

84
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:11,018
Is that what you wanted
to say?

85
00:11:11,148 --> 00:11:13,194
No, you're here 'cause
I want to know how it feels

86
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:15,631
to know an innocent man
is gonna be put to death.

87
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,111
Right.

88
00:11:18,286 --> 00:11:21,985
And, uh... you are
the innocent man?

89
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:23,334
Yeah.

90
00:11:23,465 --> 00:11:24,901
Don't get me wrong, Roy.

91
00:11:25,032 --> 00:11:27,556
I'd done some bad shit,
made some bad decisions,

92
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:30,080
but killing Joe Wieder
ain't one of them.

93
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,517
Isaac...

94
00:11:32,648 --> 00:11:33,954
you confessed.

95
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:36,043
You were brought in
for questioning

96
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:37,784
and you confessed.

97
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:40,743
So now you're telling me,
all this time later,

98
00:11:40,874 --> 00:11:42,484
suddenly you remember things
different?

99
00:11:42,614 --> 00:11:44,355
Ain't nothing sudden about it.

100
00:11:44,486 --> 00:11:47,489
I've been in here ten years.
Ten fucking years.

101
00:11:47,619 --> 00:11:50,492
Nothing to do but replay
that shit in my head.

102
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:52,189
- How it really went down.
- Right.

103
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,887
That's why I'm here.

104
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,846
So you can tell me
how it really went down.

105
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,674
Look, I know you ain't no cop
no more,

106
00:11:58,805 --> 00:12:00,067
the way they shit-canned you

107
00:12:00,197 --> 00:12:01,633
over that drunk-driving
accident,

108
00:12:01,764 --> 00:12:04,245
but maybe you want to clear
your conscience.

109
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:07,944
At least hear me out...
this time.

110
00:12:10,599 --> 00:12:12,035
I'm listening.

111
00:12:13,123 --> 00:12:14,516
Night of the murder,

112
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:17,301
I was so strung out,
I ain't remember shit.

113
00:12:18,128 --> 00:12:20,261
<i>You guys hammered me
all night.</i>

114
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:22,654
<i>By the time I saw those
photos, I was so fucked up</i>

115
00:12:22,785 --> 00:12:24,569
<i>I thought I must have done it.</i>

116
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,658
You broke in,
you beat him to death.

117
00:12:26,789 --> 00:12:28,530
We found your fingerprints
all over the house!

118
00:12:29,313 --> 00:12:30,532
Come on!

119
00:12:30,662 --> 00:12:33,622
Just admit it, son. Admit it.

120
00:12:34,405 --> 00:12:37,669
This was you. This was you!
You did this! This is you!

121
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,324
This is all fucking you!

122
00:12:40,455 --> 00:12:43,066
Admit it!

123
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:44,154
Yeah.

124
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,203
Why did you go to his house?

125
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:52,772
The year before
Wieder got killed,

126
00:12:52,902 --> 00:12:54,556
I got rung up for theft.

127
00:12:55,687 --> 00:12:57,472
Formula for my little man.

128
00:12:57,602 --> 00:13:00,649
And Wieder testified as
an expert witness for the DA.

129
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,999
I told the judge
I was so high that night

130
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,522
I wasn't thinking straight,

131
00:13:04,653 --> 00:13:07,177
but Wieder said I knew
exactly what I was doing.

132
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:08,918
So they tried me as an adult.

133
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,920
You know what it's like
to be 18 years old

134
00:13:11,051 --> 00:13:12,792
and some skinhead's bitch?

135
00:13:14,097 --> 00:13:15,969
Let's just go back over this.

136
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:18,493
Wieder testifies against you
and gets you prison time.

137
00:13:18,623 --> 00:13:20,974
You go to his house, it's late
at night. You're angry.

138
00:13:21,104 --> 00:13:24,151
You don't like this--I ain't no killer!

139
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,850
I just wanted my son back

140
00:13:28,590 --> 00:13:30,244
and I thought maybe
Wieder could help.

141
00:13:33,073 --> 00:13:35,466
<i>Yeah, I went to his house.</i>

142
00:13:36,119 --> 00:13:37,642
<i>I waited for his caretaker
to leave</i>

143
00:13:37,773 --> 00:13:39,209
<i>and I went round the back.</i>

144
00:13:48,305 --> 00:13:50,655
<i>I even made it
all the way inside.</i>

145
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:52,919
Hello, Shadow.

146
00:13:54,964 --> 00:13:57,575
<i>But then
someone else came in.</i>

147
00:13:57,706 --> 00:14:00,840
Oh! Back so soon?

148
00:14:05,018 --> 00:14:06,541
<i>And then
shit just went bad.</i>

149
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:08,804
I'm sorry.

150
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:15,245
<i>I panicked and I left
before I could see who it was.</i>

151
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:16,812
[Wieder] No!

152
00:14:16,943 --> 00:14:21,208
Okay. So you never touched him.

153
00:14:21,338 --> 00:14:24,559
Uh, but you don't... I'm telling you the truth!

154
00:14:29,607 --> 00:14:31,044
Okay, Isaac.

155
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,702
You think I'm lying.

156
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:45,710
Well, ask Richard Finn.
He'd tell you.

157
00:14:48,322 --> 00:14:49,845
You're gonna have
to remind me.

158
00:14:49,976 --> 00:14:53,457
Um... who-who
is Richard Finn?

159
00:14:53,588 --> 00:14:55,633
He came to see me
a few months back.

160
00:14:55,764 --> 00:14:57,984
He's writing some book
about the murder.

161
00:14:58,810 --> 00:15:00,812
- A book?
- Yeah.

162
00:15:02,553 --> 00:15:04,991
Look, uh,
Isaac, I just don't see

163
00:15:05,121 --> 00:15:07,254
that I'm gonna be in
a position to get involved.

164
00:15:07,384 --> 00:15:10,213
You already involved, Roy!
This is on you.

165
00:15:10,344 --> 00:15:12,955
You were there when I signed
that fucking confession!

166
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:16,002
Make it right!

167
00:15:16,132 --> 00:15:18,352
I paid for what I did
when I was 18.

168
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:21,485
Make this shit right
or I'm dead!

169
00:15:48,425 --> 00:15:51,341
<i>The medication

170
00:15:51,472 --> 00:15:53,561

171
00:15:53,691 --> 00:15:57,391

172
00:16:09,446 --> 00:16:11,709
It was you!
It was you! Admit it!

173
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,624
You did this! This is you!

174
00:16:13,755 --> 00:16:15,887
Well, ask Richard Finn.

175
00:17:16,122 --> 00:17:17,384
Hey!

176
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:23,172
Roy?

177
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,479
Yeah.

178
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,699
What the fuck
are you doing here?

179
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,573
I was just
in the neighborhood.

180
00:17:32,703 --> 00:17:34,140
Come in.

181
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:38,927
Hey.

182
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:43,497
Come in,
come in, come in.

183
00:17:44,498 --> 00:17:45,673
Come in, come in.

184
00:17:47,718 --> 00:17:51,026
You know, I can't remember
the last time I saw your face.

185
00:17:52,984 --> 00:17:54,029
There you go, Roy.

186
00:17:55,726 --> 00:17:57,989
You know when it was?

187
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:00,340
Ahh, it must have been
ten years ago

188
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:03,299
when those fucking sons
of bitches took your badge.

189
00:18:04,257 --> 00:18:05,432
Yeah, I suppose so.

190
00:18:10,393 --> 00:18:13,657
Listen, I hope you're not still
carrying around all that shit.

191
00:18:14,354 --> 00:18:17,313
I mean, we all drank
on the job back then.

192
00:18:17,444 --> 00:18:18,967
That accident,

193
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,969
that could have been
any one of us.

194
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:24,103
Cheers.

195
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:25,408
Cheers.

196
00:18:30,326 --> 00:18:32,763
What's up?
You on the wagon or something?

197
00:18:32,894 --> 00:18:35,114
Uh... well, yeah.

198
00:18:35,244 --> 00:18:38,421
My-my doctor says it'll
mess with my medication, so...

199
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:39,988
You're sick, Roy?

200
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,600
No. I'm doing, uh,
like a clinical trial.

201
00:18:43,731 --> 00:18:45,602
I've got Alzheimer's,

202
00:18:45,733 --> 00:18:50,259
so they put these little
pulses into my fucking head.

203
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,956
It's supposed to
stimulate memory.

204
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:53,828
Jesus Christ, Roy.

205
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,657
If you hadn't have said
my name at the front door,

206
00:18:56,787 --> 00:18:58,311
I wouldn't have known
it was you.

207
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:00,530
So you...

208
00:19:01,488 --> 00:19:03,925
you have no memory
of you and me on the job?

209
00:19:04,578 --> 00:19:06,232
- No.
- Fuck.

210
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:08,190
No, I-I read old case files

211
00:19:08,321 --> 00:19:10,932
and it's all fresh
information for me.

212
00:19:11,498 --> 00:19:13,239
Yeah, but it's not just
my time on the job.

213
00:19:13,369 --> 00:19:15,197
My whole fucking life
is a black hole. I...

214
00:19:15,893 --> 00:19:17,112
Fuck, man.

215
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:23,205
Remember Cat?

216
00:19:24,772 --> 00:19:26,121
My wife.

217
00:19:31,257 --> 00:19:32,954
Anyway, she, uh...

218
00:19:34,303 --> 00:19:35,696
she passed last year.

219
00:19:36,218 --> 00:19:37,176
Cancer.

220
00:19:37,306 --> 00:19:38,655
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah.

221
00:19:38,786 --> 00:19:40,527
Fucking cancer.

222
00:19:42,398 --> 00:19:44,139
Department health fund

223
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:47,011
wouldn't pay
her hospital bills.

224
00:19:47,577 --> 00:19:48,883
I had to sort it out.

225
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,886
Anyway, you didn't come here
for that shit.

226
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:54,671
What brings you by, Roy?

227
00:19:55,759 --> 00:20:00,329
Okay. Uh... you remember a guy
called Isaac Samuel?

228
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:02,679
He got convicted for murder,

229
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:04,768
that thing that happened
at Waterford College

230
00:20:04,899 --> 00:20:06,205
with a professor?

231
00:20:06,335 --> 00:20:08,032
Ahh. You've been
talking to the lady

232
00:20:08,163 --> 00:20:09,773
from the advocacy group.

233
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:12,646
I didn't call her back.

234
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:15,518
Oh, well, I took the call

235
00:20:15,649 --> 00:20:20,219
and, uh, she said that Isaac
wanted to talk to me, so...

236
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,048
You spoke to Isaac Samuel?

237
00:20:24,179 --> 00:20:27,356
Yeah. I went down
to the state prison

238
00:20:27,487 --> 00:20:29,315
and we talked and, uh...

239
00:20:31,621 --> 00:20:33,014
he tells me he didn't do it.

240
00:20:33,144 --> 00:20:36,365
Come on, Roy. That's what
they all say on death row.

241
00:20:36,496 --> 00:20:37,845
Yeah, I know, I know.

242
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:43,154
But I gotta say, Jimmy,
he was... convincing.

243
00:20:43,285 --> 00:20:47,158
He mentioned another guy
that came to see him. Uh...

244
00:20:51,772 --> 00:20:53,077
Finn.

245
00:20:53,208 --> 00:20:54,862
Richard Finn.

246
00:20:55,602 --> 00:20:57,995
Does that name ring
any kind of bell with you?

247
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:03,000
It was so long ago,
I-I-I don't remember...

248
00:21:03,131 --> 00:21:05,002
Well, I read the file

249
00:21:05,742 --> 00:21:07,788
and when we dusted that house,

250
00:21:09,224 --> 00:21:12,183
Finn's prints are
all over the place inside.

251
00:21:12,314 --> 00:21:13,272
All through the house.

252
00:21:13,837 --> 00:21:14,708
So?

253
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:18,059
They were there. Who cares?

254
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:19,887
Richard Finn said
he wasn't at the house

255
00:21:20,017 --> 00:21:21,105
the night of the murder.

256
00:21:21,236 --> 00:21:23,064
That's in his statement, okay?

257
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:24,935
But we never followed it up.

258
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,242
We never corroborated
his whereabouts

259
00:21:27,373 --> 00:21:29,679
and I just kinda found that
a bit strange.

260
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,290
Is that not strange?

261
00:21:33,248 --> 00:21:34,641
What's your point?

262
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:36,469
I don't know.

263
00:21:36,599 --> 00:21:38,079
I was just thinking
that you and me,

264
00:21:38,209 --> 00:21:39,689
we'd maybe go and talk to him,

265
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:41,822
see what he has to say
for himself.

266
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:45,129
- Why?
- I don't know.

267
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:46,479
It's just a feeling.

268
00:21:46,609 --> 00:21:48,481
That's all I got to go on
these days.

269
00:21:48,611 --> 00:21:51,701
Besides, my doctor says
I gotta keep my mind active,

270
00:21:51,832 --> 00:21:53,529
so what the fuck, huh?

271
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:57,098
Sure, Roy.

272
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:00,014
I'll look into it.

273
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:02,103
I still got a few friends
on the job.

274
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,499
Okay.

275
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:10,067
I'll be in touch, Roy.

276
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:12,042
<i>♪ You ♪</i>

277
00:23:12,956 --> 00:23:14,218
<i>♪ What do you see? ♪</i>

278
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,357
Ah!

279
00:23:35,675 --> 00:23:37,764
Yeah.
<i>I found your boy.</i>

280
00:23:37,894 --> 00:23:39,679
<i>I found Richard Finn.</i>

281
00:23:42,203 --> 00:23:44,945
The landlady found him
when she let the gas man in.

282
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:46,729
How did he die?

283
00:23:50,037 --> 00:23:52,039
Overdose. Fentanyl.

284
00:23:56,347 --> 00:23:57,914
Only one needle hole.

285
00:23:58,654 --> 00:24:00,047
What?

286
00:24:00,177 --> 00:24:01,570
He's not much of a junkie.

287
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:03,093
There's no track marks.

288
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:05,444
So he's a newbie.
Didn't know what he was doing.

289
00:24:17,543 --> 00:24:19,936
- You alright there, Roy?
- He was there.

290
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,156
At the crime scene.

291
00:24:22,286 --> 00:24:24,419
- Yeah. You said that.
- No.

292
00:24:24,550 --> 00:24:25,986
No, not just his prints.

293
00:24:26,116 --> 00:24:29,598
He was there the next morning
when we were there.

294
00:24:29,729 --> 00:24:31,121
Is this what you're
remembering,

295
00:24:31,252 --> 00:24:32,601
seeing him at the crime scene?

296
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:37,345
This guy's prints are
at the house. All over it.

297
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:39,695
He turns up to the crime scene
the next morning.

298
00:24:40,435 --> 00:24:41,784
We talk to him.

299
00:24:41,915 --> 00:24:44,134
His alibi for the time
of the murder

300
00:24:44,265 --> 00:24:45,919
is that he was home alone.

301
00:24:46,049 --> 00:24:47,094
And we don't follow it up.

302
00:24:47,224 --> 00:24:48,487
We don't talk to his friends,

303
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:49,966
we don't talk
to his neighbors.

304
00:24:50,097 --> 00:24:53,187
Isaac Samuel's prints
were all over the house.

305
00:24:53,317 --> 00:24:56,669
He had motive
and he confessed.

306
00:24:56,799 --> 00:24:58,627
It doesn't make sense.

307
00:24:58,758 --> 00:25:01,891
Well, it doesn't matter now.
The dead don't talk.

308
00:25:02,631 --> 00:25:03,502
Yeah, maybe.

309
00:25:04,503 --> 00:25:06,156
But they do leave shit behind.

310
00:25:07,375 --> 00:25:10,552
From ashes to ashes,
from dust to the dust,

311
00:25:10,683 --> 00:25:11,988
so it must be.

312
00:25:12,859 --> 00:25:15,383
Oh, God,
the spirit of all our joys,

313
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:17,428
the cause of our delights,

314
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:20,867
the glory of
our darkest nights.

315
00:25:23,434 --> 00:25:24,914
Uh, Mrs. Finn?

316
00:25:25,741 --> 00:25:27,047
My name's Roy Freeman.

317
00:25:27,177 --> 00:25:28,222
I, uh...

318
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,398
I understand this is
a very bad time,

319
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:32,400
but can I just ask
a couple of questions

320
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,184
about your husband?

321
00:25:34,315 --> 00:25:37,100
Uh... I'm her husband, Eddie.

322
00:25:38,014 --> 00:25:39,494
Oh, I'm so sorry, Eddie.

323
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:42,802
Hi. Uh... is the other Mrs. Finn
around here somewhere?

324
00:25:42,932 --> 00:25:44,412
Uh, no.

325
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,675
She and Richard weren't
exactly on the best of terms.

326
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:48,634
Now, is there something
I can help you with?

327
00:25:48,764 --> 00:25:50,723
He was my brother.

328
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:53,029
I'm looking into a case

329
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:55,597
that your brother was
particularly interested in.

330
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,426
Recently he went to visit
a death row inmate

331
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,602
and he mentioned he was
actually writing a book

332
00:26:00,733 --> 00:26:01,995
on the subject.

333
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,779
I wondered if you knew
anything about this.

334
00:26:03,910 --> 00:26:05,520
I'm gonna get a ride
home with Aunt Jude.

335
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:06,565
- Yeah.
- Okay?

336
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:08,479
Okay.
- Okay.

337
00:26:12,396 --> 00:26:14,790
I'm, uh... just over here.

338
00:26:20,013 --> 00:26:20,970
Here.

339
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,016
I found it in his apartment.

340
00:26:23,669 --> 00:26:25,235
He called it
<i>The Book of Mirrors.</i>

341
00:26:25,366 --> 00:26:27,237
The title doesn't make
any sense to me.

342
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:28,848
<i>Book of Mirrors...</i>

343
00:26:29,718 --> 00:26:32,808
Isaac Samuel,
that, uh, death row inmate,

344
00:26:32,939 --> 00:26:35,115
he said this is about
the Wieder murder?

345
00:26:35,245 --> 00:26:36,943
Yeah, well,
if Richard were here,

346
00:26:37,073 --> 00:26:39,510
he'd probably call it
a crime memoir or some shit.

347
00:26:39,641 --> 00:26:41,512
You read it?

348
00:26:41,643 --> 00:26:42,862
Much as I could stomach.

349
00:26:42,992 --> 00:26:44,907
It's a bunch of
self-aggrandizing garbage,

350
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:46,430
you ask me.

351
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:48,171
About some girl he was
obsessed with in college.

352
00:26:48,955 --> 00:26:50,870
So, uh, you guys weren't close?

353
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:52,741
Look, I don't mean
to speak ill of the dead,

354
00:26:52,872 --> 00:26:54,221
but Richard wasn't
exactly someone

355
00:26:54,351 --> 00:26:56,353
that you wanted
to get close to.

356
00:26:57,659 --> 00:26:59,313
How long had he been using?

357
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:00,488
Drugs?

358
00:27:00,619 --> 00:27:02,316
No. No.

359
00:27:02,446 --> 00:27:04,057
I never knew him
to be into drugs.

360
00:27:04,187 --> 00:27:07,190
It just didn't seem his thing.
Then again, with Richard,

361
00:27:07,321 --> 00:27:09,671
nothing was ever really
how it seemed.

362
00:27:10,454 --> 00:27:12,282
I mean, he'd always
been a little bit off,

363
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:13,632
even when we were kids,

364
00:27:14,197 --> 00:27:16,939
but this last year,
last couple of years, even,

365
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,898
something just
didn't seem right.

366
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:20,160
What was different?

367
00:27:20,290 --> 00:27:21,857
I don't know. He was...

368
00:27:23,337 --> 00:27:25,121
agitated, paranoid.

369
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,385
Just like he comes across
in that book.

370
00:27:29,299 --> 00:27:30,387
Now, listen, if I were you,

371
00:27:30,518 --> 00:27:32,085
I wouldn't waste
too much time on it.

372
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:35,828
Okay. I can keep this?

373
00:27:35,958 --> 00:27:37,438

00:34:06,305 --> 00:34:08,263
<i>my father
died of a heart attack.</i>

487

my room and board.</i>

489

<i>and that's how I first met
Professor Joseph Wieder."</i>

490
00:34:21,581 --> 00:34:23,713
Laura. Welcome!

491
00:34:23,844 --> 00:34:25,150
Uh, sorry we're late.

492
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,326
- Not a problem.
- Hi.

493
00:34:27,456 --> 00:34:28,457
Hello!

494
00:34:30,851 --> 00:34:33,027
Had to finish a call with
our friend in DC, anyway.

495
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,160
- Ah! Mm-hm.
- Mm-mm.

496
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:37,162
You must be Richard.

497
00:34:37,292 --> 00:34:38,598
Laura's told me a lot
about you.

498
00:34:39,468 --> 00:34:40,643
All lies, I'm sure.

499
00:34:40,774 --> 00:34:42,471
Exaggerations and half-truths.

500
00:34:42,602 --> 00:34:44,038
Those I can live with.

501
00:34:44,169 --> 00:34:45,605
Do we feel like martinis?

502
00:34:45,735 --> 00:34:47,259
- Sure.
- Yes!

503
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:54,744
So, Richard, Laura tells me
you want to be a novelist.

504
00:34:54,875 --> 00:34:56,833
Literary memoir, actually.

505
00:34:56,964 --> 00:34:58,270
- Mmm!
- Oh?

506
00:34:59,184 --> 00:35:00,185
I'm not familiar.

507
00:35:00,315 --> 00:35:01,621
Well, you see,

508
00:35:01,751 --> 00:35:03,318
a traditional memoir is
someone's life story.

509
00:35:03,449 --> 00:35:05,799
The genre's not concerned
with questions of truth,

510
00:35:05,929 --> 00:35:08,541
imagination, memory, style.

511
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:11,152
Literary memoir has
a fictional element, then?

512
00:35:11,283 --> 00:35:13,154
No, no, I wouldn't call it
fictional, really.

513
00:35:13,285 --> 00:35:14,851
- No.
- Oh. Sorry.

514
00:35:16,026 --> 00:35:17,506
No, you see, uh, the author's

515
00:35:17,637 --> 00:35:18,899
telling the truth of the story

516
00:35:19,029 --> 00:35:20,335
as he believes it to be true.

517
00:35:20,466 --> 00:35:22,250
They. As <i>they</i> believe it
to be true.

518
00:35:22,381 --> 00:35:24,557
Self-perception
and personal experience

519
00:35:24,687 --> 00:35:25,993
have a part in it.

520
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,212
Okay.

521
00:35:32,042 --> 00:35:33,000
More wine?

522
00:35:33,131 --> 00:35:34,480
- Please.
- Yes!

523
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:41,139
You know something?

524
00:35:41,269 --> 00:35:42,531
Ten years from now...

525
00:35:42,662 --> 00:35:43,837
we'll look back
to this dinner

526
00:35:43,967 --> 00:35:45,317
and all we'll remember is

527
00:35:45,447 --> 00:35:47,057
the Chateau Leoville Barton.

528
00:35:47,188 --> 00:35:49,451
Oh, I doubt that.

529
00:35:49,582 --> 00:35:52,062
The mind replaces memories
all the time.

530
00:35:52,193 --> 00:35:53,716
It's innate to its wiring.

531
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,589
Especially if you drink
too much.

532
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:04,901
Do the thing.

533
00:36:05,032 --> 00:36:06,947
Hmm?[Laura] Come on!

534
00:36:07,077 --> 00:36:08,992
It's not a party trick.

535
00:36:09,123 --> 00:36:11,343
Wait. What is she
talking about?

536
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:13,301
It helps explain
what we're working on.

537
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,872
Okay, then. Pick a memory. Hmm?

538
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:20,613
From your childhood. Anything.

539
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:23,137
Objects, moments, people.

540
00:36:23,268 --> 00:36:25,531
Anything you can
easily recall?

541
00:36:26,227 --> 00:36:27,663
Uh...

542
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:31,058
Okay.
Uh...

543
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:35,280
I remember we had
this green shag rug

544
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:37,064
and, uh...

545
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:39,458
...four goldfish

546
00:36:39,588 --> 00:36:40,981
named after the guys in KISS.

547
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:43,810
That's a good memory.

548
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,205
How about something that
you wish you could forget?

549
00:36:48,423 --> 00:36:49,598
Um...

550
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:51,209
Did your parents ever hit you?

551
00:36:55,125 --> 00:36:56,301
No.

552
00:36:56,431 --> 00:36:57,693
Did you ever get lost

553
00:36:57,824 --> 00:37:01,088
in a shopping mall
or a big supermarket?

554
00:37:02,481 --> 00:37:05,875
I mean... come to think of it,
there was this one time

555
00:37:06,006 --> 00:37:08,704
we went to a toy store,
and, uh...

556
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:12,621
I... I couldn't find my mom.

557
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:14,232
Were you scared?

558
00:37:16,059 --> 00:37:17,539
I mean, I haven't
thought about it

559
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,149
since it happened, but...

560
00:37:19,802 --> 00:37:20,716
Yeah.

561
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:22,283
I looked for her everywhere.

562
00:37:22,414 --> 00:37:24,242
And you eventually found her?

563
00:37:25,982 --> 00:37:28,550
Uh... outside smoking.

564
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,642
Huh. It's... crazy.

565
00:37:34,513 --> 00:37:36,732
I'd forgotten all that.

566
00:37:40,301 --> 00:37:43,261
At the, uh... the heart
of our research, uh...

567
00:37:44,174 --> 00:37:46,002
Joe's research

568
00:37:46,133 --> 00:37:49,615
is the thesis that most people
experience trauma,

569
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:51,791
but the mind blocks
those memories

570
00:37:51,921 --> 00:37:54,141
from ever actually presenting.

571
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:56,099
The trauma you
experienced that day

572
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,101
was your mother
abandoning you.

573
00:37:58,232 --> 00:38:00,495
You were a child. Vulnerable.

574
00:38:00,626 --> 00:38:04,194
And that fact that your mother
might actually harm you

575
00:38:04,325 --> 00:38:06,371
is too traumatic to process.

576
00:38:06,501 --> 00:38:09,417
So you suppressed it
from memory.

577
00:38:09,548 --> 00:38:12,115
But the effects of that trauma

578
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:14,117
still linger
in your subconscious

579
00:38:14,248 --> 00:38:17,120
and become part of the fabric
of who you are.

580
00:38:19,819 --> 00:38:20,907
Wow. Okay.

581
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:22,125
That's...

582
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:23,736
Therapy with dinner.

583
00:38:23,866 --> 00:38:25,303
Cheers.

584
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:34,268
Richard.

585
00:38:34,921 --> 00:38:36,226
Would you come with me?

586
00:38:36,357 --> 00:38:38,925
I've got something
I'd like to show you. Hmm?

587
00:38:39,926 --> 00:38:41,362
Okay.

588
00:38:55,376 --> 00:38:59,249
Okay.
That's a lot of books.

589
00:38:59,380 --> 00:39:02,818
I can offer you $500 a week
to organize it.

590
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,430
To classify them
electronically,

591
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:07,910
when you can, until you're done,

592
00:39:08,041 --> 00:39:10,739
which, if I had to guess,
won't be anytime soon.

593
00:39:11,392 --> 00:39:15,527
I... I mean, I don't really
know what to say. Uh...

594
00:39:15,657 --> 00:39:18,094
Laura told me about what
happened to your father

595
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:19,966
and the situation
that you're in.

596
00:39:22,272 --> 00:39:24,753
So you might want to
just say you'll do it.

597
00:39:26,581 --> 00:39:28,017
Thank you.

00:43:07,062 --> 00:43:08,368
I don't really know how.

649
00:43:08,498 --> 00:43:10,805
Well, you should learn.

650
00:43:10,936 --> 00:43:13,634
Maybe you're good at it,
maybe you're not, hmm?

651
00:43:14,896 --> 00:43:16,115
Experiment.

652
00:43:16,245 --> 00:43:17,812
Mm-hm.

653
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:20,554
Laura likes a man
who can cook.

654
00:43:22,948 --> 00:43:25,124
How are things going
between you two?

655
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:28,214
We're just friends.

656
00:43:28,344 --> 00:43:29,911
Oh, come on.

657
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:32,784
I got the impression
you were more than that.

658
00:43:32,914 --> 00:43:34,699
Is that what she told you?

659
00:43:34,829 --> 00:43:36,788
I don't need Laura to tell me
something to know it.

660
00:43:36,918 --> 00:43:38,398
I can sense things.

661
00:43:38,528 --> 00:43:40,313
I've known her
for some time now.

662
00:43:41,357 --> 00:43:43,490
Right. I mean,
I-I would never presume...

663
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:46,449
But, Richard, she brought you
into my life to help,

664
00:43:46,580 --> 00:43:48,626
not to complicate things.

665
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:51,150
And that's what I'm here for,
to help.

666
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:52,717
Well, good.

667
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:54,893
To that end, then,

668
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:59,158
I think-- and these are
just my thoughts--

669
00:44:00,507 --> 00:44:04,119
I think it would be better if
you stopped seeing each other.

670
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,513
Wait, what?

671
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:09,777
Nobody likes it when things

672
00:44:09,908 --> 00:44:12,171
become overly complicated.

673
00:44:15,348 --> 00:44:18,612
I'm going out of town to meet
some people about my book.

674
00:44:19,308 --> 00:44:21,571
I imagine when I get back

675
00:44:21,702 --> 00:44:24,487
you will have sorted out
some new arrangement.

676
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,100
Bon appétit.

677
00:44:31,364 --> 00:44:32,887
<i>"He'd crossed a line,</i>

678
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:35,107

anything out.</i>

679
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,936

680
00:44:38,066 --> 00:44:39,851
Babe?

681
00:44:40,852 --> 00:44:41,983
You home?

682
00:44:43,768 --> 00:44:44,812
Hey, uh...

683
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,424
I got you some stuff
from Bamboo House.

684
00:44:49,512 --> 00:44:51,558
You know,
those dumplings you like.

685
00:44:54,996 --> 00:44:56,171
Babe?

686
00:45:00,088 --> 00:45:01,350
<i>"She was gone.</i>

687
00:45:02,308 --> 00:45:05,572

it happened."</i>

688
00:45:08,836 --> 00:45:11,447
<i>"Professor Joseph Wieder

699

No, it doesn't work like that.

700
00:45:50,965 --> 00:45:52,445
The US Government
commissioned the study.

701
00:45:52,575 --> 00:45:53,794
The grant is for
Professor Wieder.

702
00:45:53,925 --> 00:45:55,317
But I wrote it!

703
00:45:56,492 --> 00:45:58,146
Look, Ms. Baines,

704
00:45:58,277 --> 00:46:01,236
I don't know what arrangement
you made with Dr. Wieder,

705
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:03,151
but I recommend you take it up
with the university

706
00:46:03,282 --> 00:46:04,326
or directly with him.

707
00:46:04,457 --> 00:46:06,111
Oh, come on! This is my work

708
00:46:06,241 --> 00:46:08,069
and he just
put his name on it!

709
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:10,071
- I'm sorry.
- Is that all you can say?

710
00:46:10,202 --> 00:46:11,420
This is bullshit!

711
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:13,988
You can't just get away
with this!

712
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:17,775
<i>"After the murder,
she disappeared.</i>

713
00:46:18,863 --> 00:46:21,909
<i>It was like she'd fallen right
off the face of the Earth."</i>

714
00:46:23,693 --> 00:46:25,695
<i>"Until the day
I saw her again."</i>

715
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:29,003
"Until...
I saw her again."

716
00:46:33,703 --> 00:46:35,488
Until you saw her again where?

717
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:38,578
Ah, you motherfucker!

718
00:46:54,246 --> 00:46:56,770
You know what?
She's probably dead.

719
00:46:56,901 --> 00:47:00,034
Her social security
number is still active.

720
00:47:00,165 --> 00:47:03,298
She's got no address,
no social media presence,

721
00:47:03,429 --> 00:47:04,909
no place of business, nothing.

722
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:06,824
Just one old pic
from high school.

723
00:47:06,954 --> 00:47:08,782
So what?
She's a private person.

724
00:47:08,913 --> 00:47:10,653
It's the same with
Wayne Devereaux,

725
00:47:10,784 --> 00:47:12,264
Wieder's caretaker.

726
00:47:12,394 --> 00:47:14,657
No phone number,
no job history.

727
00:47:14,788 --> 00:47:17,443
I did a reverse address
search, nothing.

728
00:47:17,573 --> 00:47:20,141
It's like everyone from
Wieder's life at that time

729
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:21,751
is now a fucking ghost.

730
00:47:22,404 --> 00:47:23,623
You know what?

731
00:47:24,276 --> 00:47:26,931
You're making me feel like
I want to be a fucking ghost.

732
00:47:27,583 --> 00:47:31,283
The only one I've been able to
track down is Finn's ex-wife.

733
00:47:31,413 --> 00:47:33,111
I'm gonna go and talk to her.

734
00:47:34,199 --> 00:47:35,983
And what the fuck's
she gonna say to you?

735
00:47:36,114 --> 00:47:37,202
I don't know.

736
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:39,247
She might know something.

737
00:47:39,726 --> 00:47:42,120
You know? Finn might
have been onto something.

738
00:47:42,250 --> 00:47:44,687
That's a lot of somethings
and maybes and ifs and buts.

739
00:47:44,818 --> 00:47:47,952
Look, man,
if Isaac Samuel is innocent

740
00:47:48,082 --> 00:47:50,258
and we've put away
the wrong guy,

741
00:47:50,389 --> 00:47:51,781
come on.

742
00:47:51,912 --> 00:47:53,871
That's a chance for us
to make that right.

743
00:47:54,001 --> 00:47:56,961
- The guy confessed!
- I know he confessed, okay?

744
00:47:57,091 --> 00:47:59,964
He admits he was in the house
on that night. He says that.

745
00:48:00,094 --> 00:48:03,271
But he also says
before he could do anything,

746
00:48:03,402 --> 00:48:05,752
someone else came in
to the house.

747
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:07,145
Who?

748
00:48:07,275 --> 00:48:08,711
Who came in, Roy?

749
00:48:10,539 --> 00:48:11,801
I don't know.

750
00:48:11,932 --> 00:48:13,238
Well, if you don't
fucking know,

751
00:48:13,368 --> 00:48:15,544
then I don't
fucking know either.

752
00:48:19,113 --> 00:48:20,767
I'm gonna take a piss.

753
00:48:29,384 --> 00:48:30,951
<i>And he drops in another one!</i>

754
00:48:31,082 --> 00:48:32,518
<i>This kid's on fire!</i>

755
00:48:51,972 --> 00:48:53,191
Hey!

756
00:48:54,844 --> 00:48:55,845
What the fuck, man?

757
00:48:57,456 --> 00:48:58,892
I'm sorry.

758
00:49:03,549 --> 00:49:07,466
<i>Hallucinations are
often a common byproduct</i>

759
00:49:07,596 --> 00:49:09,250
<i>of the procedure.</i>

760
00:49:09,381 --> 00:49:11,861
But I've only ever seen
pictures of her.

761
00:49:11,992 --> 00:49:15,213
Yeah, well,
it indicates recall,

762
00:49:15,343 --> 00:49:17,302
even if it wasn't really her.

763
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:20,087
Same with the snippets of
memory you've reported.

764
00:49:20,827 --> 00:49:25,049
It means your neural pathways
are starting to reactivate.

765
00:49:25,875 --> 00:49:28,095
So I'm not just going
completely crazy, then?

766
00:49:28,226 --> 00:49:30,054
Far from it.

767
00:49:30,184 --> 00:49:32,752
You're actually what we'd call
a good result.

768
00:49:33,405 --> 00:49:34,797
Treatment's working.

769
00:49:52,772 --> 00:49:56,602
[man] Put that down!

770
00:50:19,407 --> 00:50:20,843
Ms. Finn?

771
00:50:20,974 --> 00:50:22,062
I'm sorry
to disturb you. I...

772
00:50:22,193 --> 00:50:23,455
You the cop?

773
00:50:24,586 --> 00:50:27,241
Roy Freeman, yeah. I called.

774
00:50:27,372 --> 00:50:28,895
Yeah, I'm actually,
you know, uh...

775
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:30,897
...retired.

776
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:33,291
And so I'm not with
the police anymore.

777
00:50:33,421 --> 00:50:35,989
Good. Never liked cops.

778
00:50:44,780 --> 00:50:46,304
<i>Doesn't make sense.</i>

779
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:48,393
Richard was a lot of things--

780
00:50:48,523 --> 00:50:50,612
paranoid, deluded,

781
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:53,180
real misanthrope.

782
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:55,791
But he wasn't a druggie.

783
00:50:56,792 --> 00:51:01,362
So you think his death
was an accident, maybe?

784
00:51:01,493 --> 00:51:03,756
I bet that cunt,
Elizabeth Westlake,

785
00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:05,323
had something to do with it.

786
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:12,504
I'm sorry.
I-I don't know who that is.

787
00:51:12,634 --> 00:51:15,246
Yeah. Neither did I
until recently.

788
00:51:16,638 --> 00:51:18,031
Crazy-ass bitch.

789
00:51:19,989 --> 00:51:21,774
They had some big argument

790
00:51:21,904 --> 00:51:24,168
a few weeks before
Richard moved out.

791
00:51:26,344 --> 00:51:29,477
Elizabeth... Westlake?

792
00:51:29,608 --> 00:51:31,784
Yeah.[Roy] Yeah. Okay.

793
00:51:33,438 --> 00:51:35,222
Richard started
drinking again.

794
00:51:36,223 --> 00:51:38,660
And one night he comes home
screaming on the phone

795
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:40,575
all pissed.

796
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:42,055
Huh. No, no, no.

797
00:51:42,186 --> 00:51:44,057
No, no, no.

798
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:46,494
No, no, no,
you listen to me, okay?

799
00:51:46,625 --> 00:51:47,930
Don't you fucking lie to me!

800
00:51:48,061 --> 00:51:49,671
<i>He must have thought
I was asleep.</i>

801
00:51:49,802 --> 00:51:52,718
Okay, I-I know what you did.
Yeah.

802
00:51:52,848 --> 00:51:54,937
And you're not gonna
get away with it.

803
00:51:56,461 --> 00:51:59,159
You ever ask him
what the argument was about?

804
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,773
I tried not to talk to Richard
when he was like that.

805
00:52:05,774 --> 00:52:06,819
Right.

806
00:52:11,084 --> 00:52:13,565
<i>So I waited
until he was asleep.</i>

807
00:52:18,178 --> 00:52:20,093
<i>Next day, I called the number,</i>

808
00:52:20,224 --> 00:52:21,964
and got her voicemail.

809
00:52:23,096 --> 00:52:24,489
What else do you know
about her?

810
00:52:24,619 --> 00:52:26,969
Know what she does?
Do you know how they connect?

811
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:28,971
- No.
- Nothing?

812
00:52:29,668 --> 00:52:31,235
You just called her
a crazy-ass bitch.

813
00:52:31,365 --> 00:52:33,411
Look, all I know is
I never heard him talk

814
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:35,282
to anybody like that before.

815
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:37,937
Not even me.

816
00:52:39,025 --> 00:52:40,026
You ask me...

817
00:52:41,636 --> 00:52:42,985
she killed him.

818
00:53:45,091 --> 00:53:46,658
Ms. Westlake.

819
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:50,139
Oh. Mr. Freeman.

820
00:53:54,405 --> 00:53:55,710
Have we met?

821
00:53:56,668 --> 00:53:58,757
I'm sorry. I have a condition.

822
00:53:59,497 --> 00:54:00,585
I forget a lot of stuff.

823
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:02,978
Well, I'm sorry.

824
00:54:03,109 --> 00:54:04,806
We met in passing
a long time ago.

825
00:54:04,937 --> 00:54:07,548
And I'd read about your
accident in the newspaper.

826
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:11,726
Would you mind
if I asked you where?

827
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:14,468
- Where did we meet?
- I wish I could talk.

828
00:54:14,599 --> 00:54:15,817
But I need to
get to the office.

829
00:54:15,948 --> 00:54:17,166
That's okay.

830
00:54:17,297 --> 00:54:18,690
I actually just
wanted to talk to you

831
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:19,995
about Richard Finn.

832
00:54:25,523 --> 00:54:27,307
Now, there's someone
I'd like to forget.

833
00:54:27,873 --> 00:54:29,004
Why is that?

834
00:54:29,135 --> 00:54:31,572
I guess you've
never been stalked,

835
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:33,444
made to feel like you always

836
00:54:33,574 --> 00:54:34,967
need to be
looking over your shoulder.

837
00:54:35,097 --> 00:54:38,100
Oh. Yeah, well,
you know, uh...

838
00:54:39,058 --> 00:54:41,278
he had it in his mind

839
00:54:42,017 --> 00:54:45,194
that you had something to do
with Joseph Wieder's murder.

840
00:54:48,197 --> 00:54:49,547
So you've spoken to him?

841
00:54:51,070 --> 00:54:52,506
No, I haven't. Uh...

842
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:55,117
I tried to,
but he passed away.

843
00:54:58,425 --> 00:55:00,384
- I see.
- Yeah.

844
00:55:00,514 --> 00:55:01,820
He left something behind, though.

845
00:55:02,516 --> 00:55:03,822
A memoir.

846
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:06,346
And I was wondering if you'd
like to have a look at it.

847
00:55:06,477 --> 00:55:08,130
You could just tell me
what you think.

848
00:55:08,261 --> 00:55:10,785
I've worked very hard to
forget that time in my life,

849
00:55:10,916 --> 00:55:13,397
Professor Wieder's death,
and I'd rather not relive it.

850
00:55:13,527 --> 00:55:15,529
Totally understand. Yeah.

851
00:55:16,269 --> 00:55:17,836
You know, though, uh...

852
00:55:18,532 --> 00:55:20,795
there is a man
who is on death row

853
00:55:20,926 --> 00:55:22,275
for Joseph Wieder's murder

854
00:55:22,406 --> 00:55:24,103
and his date's coming up
pretty soon.

855
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:31,153
So maybe you could just,
you know, take a look.

856
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:36,376
If I have a free moment.

857
00:55:37,116 --> 00:55:39,292
Great. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

858
00:55:39,423 --> 00:55:41,076
- Alright.
- Alright.

859
00:55:41,207 --> 00:55:42,339
You have a great day.

860
00:55:43,209 --> 00:55:45,211
You take care of yourself,
now, Roy.

861
00:57:17,651 --> 00:57:19,348
This is it, man.

862
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:39,646
Mr. Devereaux?

863
00:58:49,090 --> 00:58:50,352
Mr. Devereaux?

864
00:59:03,496 --> 00:59:05,019
It's been a while.

865
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:06,586
Took me a second there
to place you,

866
00:59:06,717 --> 00:59:07,979
but my story's the same
as it was then.

867
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:09,981
I just never got to tell it
to you 'cause...

868
00:59:11,286 --> 00:59:12,723
you already had your man.

869
00:59:12,853 --> 00:59:15,290
Well, if it's okay with you,
I'd like to hear it now.

870
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:17,641
Yeah? Why is that?

871
00:59:17,771 --> 00:59:19,773
I'm just going back
through things.

872
00:59:20,295 --> 00:59:22,297
Making sure all the right
boxes got checked,

873
00:59:22,428 --> 00:59:23,734
you know?

874
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:26,954
Okay.

875
00:59:27,564 --> 00:59:28,913
Well...

876
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:31,219
Professor Wieder
found me

877
00:59:31,350 --> 00:59:33,265
<i>when I was a shell
of who I was.</i>

878
00:59:33,395 --> 00:59:35,615
<i>He helped me get back
on my feet.</i>

879
00:59:35,746 --> 00:59:37,878
<i>He got me a job
working maintenance.</i>

880
00:59:38,009 --> 00:59:41,055
<i>I mean, I remember it
crystal clear, man.</i>

881
00:59:41,186 --> 00:59:43,057
<i>He was like a celebrity.</i>

882
00:59:43,188 --> 00:59:44,319
<i>Everyone loved him.</i>

883
00:59:49,237 --> 00:59:50,935
<i>He did
all sorts of work.</i>

884
00:59:51,675 --> 00:59:53,067
<i>I don't know what exactly,</i>

885
00:59:53,198 --> 00:59:54,591
<i>but there was always
people visiting.</i>

886
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:56,854
Thank you so much.

887
00:59:56,984 --> 00:59:58,638
<i>Important people.</i>

888
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,335
<i>People from the government,</i>

889
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:02,294
Department of Defense.

890
01:00:02,424 --> 01:00:03,687
He was running a trial
for them

891
01:00:03,817 --> 01:00:05,036
out of his department
at the college.

892
01:00:05,166 --> 01:00:06,646
Trauma patients.

893
01:00:06,777 --> 01:00:09,040
Testing a medication
he developed.

894
01:00:09,649 --> 01:00:11,259
I guess I was
a perfect candidate.

895
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:14,654
<i>I was first on the ground
in Iraq.</i>

896
01:00:14,785 --> 01:00:17,004
<i>Saw my share of it
before taking a bullet.</i>

897
01:00:17,135 --> 01:00:19,616
I didn't know the real damage
till I got home.

898
01:00:19,746 --> 01:00:21,487
Just couldn't get right.

899
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:22,749
Wieder found me at the VA,

900
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:24,708
said I fit his
research profile.

901
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:27,580
What kind of research?

902
01:00:27,711 --> 01:00:31,628
Wayne, what if I told you

903
01:00:31,758 --> 01:00:34,326
that through medicine
and suggestion

904
01:00:34,456 --> 01:00:38,025
you could replace the memory
of your trauma of Iraq

905
01:00:38,156 --> 01:00:40,593
with better memories

906
01:00:40,724 --> 01:00:46,251
or perhaps erase the memory
of your trauma altogether?

907
01:00:49,428 --> 01:00:51,299
Man, I'd say sign me up.

908
01:00:52,257 --> 01:00:55,086
By activating opposite
sides of the brain,

909
01:00:55,826 --> 01:00:58,524
we can release
the emotional experiences

910
01:00:58,655 --> 01:01:00,961
trapped in our nervous system.

911
01:01:01,092 --> 01:01:04,748
But before we make
that bad memory go away,

912
01:01:05,574 --> 01:01:08,621
we have to fully confront it.

913
01:01:09,143 --> 01:01:11,232
Breathe.

914
01:01:15,497 --> 01:01:18,196
He said it was effective
for dealing with PTSD,

915
01:01:18,326 --> 01:01:20,633
but that was only part
of the treatment.

916
01:01:22,548 --> 01:01:24,158
Take one in the morning.

917
01:01:25,769 --> 01:01:27,596
And one before bed.

918
01:01:28,380 --> 01:01:30,774
<i>The rest was that
medication he developed.</i>

919
01:01:31,905 --> 01:01:34,168
<i>He said it could wipe
the slate clean.</i>

920
01:01:35,648 --> 01:01:37,389
<i>But you just told me
about Iraq.</i>

921
01:01:37,519 --> 01:01:39,304
Does that mean
the treatment didn't work?

922
01:01:40,174 --> 01:01:41,959
Oh, it did for a time.

923
01:01:42,089 --> 01:01:44,744
Details faded.
No more panic attacks.

924
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,224
But those pills, man,
I mean...

925
01:01:47,834 --> 01:01:50,532
<i>...they had some fucking
mean side effects.</i>

926
01:01:52,752 --> 01:01:54,275
<i>I didn't recognize
myself anymore.</i>

927
01:01:54,406 --> 01:01:55,712
<i>I'd black out.</i>

928
01:01:55,842 --> 01:01:58,279
No idea where I was,
how I got there.

929
01:01:58,410 --> 01:02:00,978
So you stopped
taking the medication?

930
01:02:01,108 --> 01:02:02,196
Mm-hm.

931
01:02:03,502 --> 01:02:05,373
Yeah, against
the professor's wishes.

932
01:02:06,766 --> 01:02:08,289
Where's your car?

933
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:10,509
I came here by taxi.

934
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:13,120
You want a ride?

935
01:02:13,251 --> 01:02:14,731
ASPCA in the city buys
my offcuts for dogs.

936
01:02:15,862 --> 01:02:18,778
- You sure?
- Yeah, man. Seat's free.

937
01:02:26,438 --> 01:02:28,657
Do you know anything
about Laura Baines?

938
01:02:28,788 --> 01:02:32,618
Oh, man. I don't think anybody
ever really knew Laura Baines.

939
01:02:32,749 --> 01:02:34,054
Her and Wieder were a thing, yeah?

940
01:02:34,185 --> 01:02:35,839
I don't know nothin'
about that.

941
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:38,058
From what he said, she's just
a lab assistant, nothing more.

942
01:02:38,189 --> 01:02:39,712
I mean, maybe
she'd like to be.

943
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:41,409
But if they were,
I never saw it.

944
01:02:42,236 --> 01:02:44,108
<i>Not that
I didn't see others.</i>

945
01:02:45,196 --> 01:02:47,111
<i>I'd come over the house
every now and then,</i>

946
01:02:47,241 --> 01:02:48,547
<i>to fix this and that.</i>

947
01:02:58,383 --> 01:03:00,080
<i>There were a lot of women.</i>

948
01:03:00,820 --> 01:03:02,561
He kept a record of them too.

949
01:03:03,649 --> 01:03:04,824
What kind of record?

950
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:09,960
<i>He had one of those
old-school camcorders.</i>

951
01:03:13,050 --> 01:03:16,053
<i>I guess he liked to
revisit his past exploits.</i>

952
01:03:17,532 --> 01:03:19,970
<i>Did Laura Baines
ever call him out on it?</i>

953
01:03:20,100 --> 01:03:22,537
No, man. Only time
I heard them exchange words

954
01:03:22,668 --> 01:03:25,323
was over some research paper
they were writing.

955
01:03:25,453 --> 01:03:28,413
But the night he was killed,
her and Finn,

956
01:03:28,543 --> 01:03:30,023
<i>they came over to the house</i>

957
01:03:30,154 --> 01:03:32,156
<i>and there was some kind
of argument.</i>

958
01:03:32,286 --> 01:03:34,549
We need to have
a rational conversation

959
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:36,160
without
all this accusation.

960
01:03:36,290 --> 01:03:38,379
You're fucking lying![Laura] He's not lying!

961
01:03:38,510 --> 01:03:40,555
- Oh! You wanna defend him now?
- I don't need defending.

962
01:03:40,686 --> 01:03:41,905
What were they fighting about?

963
01:03:42,035 --> 01:03:44,472
Fuck if I know,
Finn got real pissed off.

964
01:03:44,603 --> 01:03:46,039
Know what?
Fuck the both of you.

965
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:48,041
- You deserve each other.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

966
01:03:48,172 --> 01:03:49,738
<i>He left
and I went to go out front,</i>

967
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:51,436
<i>talk to him,
maybe see what's what.</i>

968
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:54,656
But he was just... gone.

969
01:03:54,787 --> 01:03:56,920
Or he never left.

970
01:03:59,357 --> 01:04:02,795
In Finn's statement,
he says he was home alone

971
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:04,710
at the time of the murder.

972
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,234
Well, I mean, I can only
tell you what I saw.

973
01:04:07,365 --> 01:04:09,758
What about Laura?
You see her leave?

974
01:04:09,889 --> 01:04:11,412
Yeah, later in a taxi.

975
01:04:13,327 --> 01:04:14,459
So where'd you go?

976
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:17,157
My usual. Old Warren.

977
01:04:18,289 --> 01:04:21,422
<i>The bartender there, Diane,</i>

978
01:04:21,988 --> 01:04:24,208
<i>even she was one of
the professor's girls.</i>

979
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:27,689
He was a good man.

980
01:04:28,255 --> 01:04:30,214
He lost his way,
that's all.

981
01:04:31,606 --> 01:04:33,782
It can happen
to any one of us.

982
01:04:33,913 --> 01:04:35,654
But it's like the Bible says.

983
01:04:37,047 --> 01:04:39,179
"Do not judge
lest you too be judged."

984
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:44,358
Thanks for the lift.

985
01:05:12,473 --> 01:05:14,084
Yeah. It's me.

986
01:05:15,476 --> 01:05:17,000
He's home.

987
01:06:01,566 --> 01:06:03,350
Diane Lynch.

988
01:07:08,894 --> 01:07:12,115
A very, very interesting read.

989
01:07:14,856 --> 01:07:16,423
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

990
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:28,827
Can I get you a water?

991
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:30,481
Maybe some whiskey.

992
01:07:31,264 --> 01:07:33,614
I, uh... I don't have any
in the house.

993
01:07:33,745 --> 01:07:35,225
Doctors. [chuckles]

994
01:07:35,355 --> 01:07:37,444
I can't even remember
the last time I had a drink.

995
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:40,447
One of the few benefits of
your condition, I suppose.

996
01:07:40,578 --> 01:07:42,058
You can't remember
the bad times.

997
01:07:42,710 --> 01:07:44,756
Can't remember the good times, either.

998
01:07:44,886 --> 01:07:46,192
That's too bad.

999
01:07:50,109 --> 01:07:51,980
Must be hard--

1000
01:07:52,111 --> 01:07:55,288
no memory of friends, family,
past experience.

1001
01:07:56,115 --> 01:07:59,075
No context for who you are.
Your place in the world.

1002
01:08:00,250 --> 01:08:02,252
I can't imagine
what that's like,

1003
01:08:02,382 --> 01:08:05,298
to feel so lost.

1004
01:08:06,734 --> 01:08:08,388
So alone.

1005
01:08:09,476 --> 01:08:11,696
So what did you think
of Finn's book?

1006
01:08:15,265 --> 01:08:16,744
It was...

1007
01:08:17,223 --> 01:08:19,269
a bunch of bullshit.

1008
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:29,148
So, you two were,
uh... never lovers?

1009
01:08:29,627 --> 01:08:32,020
No. That was just
his little fantasy.

1010
01:08:33,631 --> 01:08:35,720
People make things up
all the time.

1011
01:08:35,850 --> 01:08:37,635
Lie to protect themselves.

1012
01:08:37,765 --> 01:08:41,291
Manufacture histories to
appear more than they are

1013
01:08:41,900 --> 01:08:44,076
'cause the reality
is too painful.

1014
01:08:46,861 --> 01:08:49,037
- I spoke with Wayne Devereaux.
- Hmm.

1015
01:08:49,168 --> 01:08:51,170
He seemed to confirm
a lot of what's in there.

1016
01:08:51,301 --> 01:08:54,608
Wow. Another reliable witness.
Makes sense, though.

1017
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:56,523
Lots of vets
who suffer from trauma

1018
01:08:56,654 --> 01:08:59,178
turn to escapist invention--
video games,

1019
01:08:59,309 --> 01:09:00,658
pornography.

1020
01:09:00,788 --> 01:09:02,921
So, did he invent
the research study

1021
01:09:03,051 --> 01:09:04,444
Wieder was working on too?

1022
01:09:04,575 --> 01:09:06,707
No. Wayne was a participant
in that.

1023
01:09:06,838 --> 01:09:08,492
But if I remember correctly,

1024
01:09:08,622 --> 01:09:11,973
he didn't respond favorably
to the protocol.

1025
01:09:12,757 --> 01:09:14,715
He resented
what it did to him.

1026
01:09:14,846 --> 01:09:17,849
He was prone to bouts
of anger, aggression.

1027
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:19,677
You seem to know
a whole lot about him.

1028
01:09:19,807 --> 01:09:23,376
Well, I transcribed Wieder's
patient notes. All of them.

1029
01:09:23,942 --> 01:09:26,640
Sometimes you learn things
you'd prefer you didn't.

1030
01:09:27,511 --> 01:09:28,990
He said that
Wieder was intending

1031
01:09:29,121 --> 01:09:30,818
on publishing
his findings, so...

1032
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:32,907
That's what you do.
You work for years

1033
01:09:33,038 --> 01:09:34,387
and then
you publish your findings.

1034
01:09:34,518 --> 01:09:37,303
But he died
before it was complete.

1035
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:43,483
Do you feel he was giving
you the credit you deserved?

1036
01:09:44,484 --> 01:09:47,052
He died before we could
work that out as well.

1037
01:09:50,708 --> 01:09:54,538
A drug that can help people
forget past trauma.

1038
01:09:56,496 --> 01:09:57,715
Seems to me someone could make

1039
01:09:57,845 --> 01:09:59,630
a whole lot of money
out of that.

1040
01:10:00,587 --> 01:10:03,068
Now you think someone
killed him for money.

1041
01:10:04,417 --> 01:10:06,419
You may not have memory,
Mr. Freeman,

1042
01:10:06,550 --> 01:10:09,161
but you do have
quite the imagination.

1043
01:10:11,816 --> 01:10:15,254
People kill for a whole lot
of different reasons.

1044
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:20,607
I reached out to Susan Avery,

1045
01:10:20,738 --> 01:10:22,174
Wieder's DOD contact.

1046
01:10:22,305 --> 01:10:24,002
I know who Susan Avery is.

1047
01:10:24,132 --> 01:10:26,091
She collaborated with Wieder
for decades.

1048
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,614
So then you also know

1049
01:10:27,745 --> 01:10:30,400
that she's taken over his
department at Waterford.

1050
01:10:32,532 --> 01:10:33,577
Hmm.

1051
01:10:34,273 --> 01:10:38,495
You know, this conversation
would have been a lot better

1052
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:40,018
with whiskey.

1053
01:10:44,675 --> 01:10:46,764
You used to love
a good drink, Roy.

1054
01:10:53,161 --> 01:10:54,554
<i>Now call the play.</i>

1055
01:10:54,685 --> 01:10:57,340
I'll give you five seconds
to unbuckle your guns.

1056
01:10:59,385 --> 01:11:00,517
One.

1057
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,258
Two.

1058
01:11:03,128 --> 01:11:04,477
<i>Three.</i>

1059
01:11:04,608 --> 01:11:06,087
<i>Enough fun.
Unbuckle them.</i>

1060
01:11:06,218 --> 01:11:07,828
<i>Harry,
Jackson, get the hardware.</i>

1061
01:11:07,959 --> 01:11:08,829
<i>Doc!</i>

1062
01:11:11,354 --> 01:11:13,443
<i>Anybody else
want to try their luck?</i>

1063
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:16,010
<i>Get moving!</i>

1064
01:11:16,141 --> 01:11:17,751
<i>Come on, keep moving,
all of ya!</i>

1065
01:12:47,580 --> 01:12:49,190
Oh, fuck.

1066
01:12:53,456 --> 01:12:55,371
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

1067
01:12:55,501 --> 01:12:57,895
Yeah, uh, I wanna report
a shooting.

1068
01:12:59,157 --> 01:13:01,202
Mr. Freeman, I'm going to
read you your rights.

1069
01:13:01,899 --> 01:13:03,857
You have the right
to remain silent.

1070
01:13:03,988 --> 01:13:05,555
If you refuse this right,

1071
01:13:05,685 --> 01:13:08,601
anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

1072
01:13:08,732 --> 01:13:10,647
You have the right
to an attorney.

1073
01:13:10,777 --> 01:13:12,170
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

1074
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,998
one will be appointed to you
by the court.

1075
01:13:25,488 --> 01:13:27,054
We all done?

1076
01:13:28,012 --> 01:13:29,535
Case closed.

1077
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:31,929
Another one off the books.

1078
01:13:32,059 --> 01:13:35,019
Let's go celebrate.
I'm buying.

1079
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:39,632
Yeah. Let me catch you up.

1080
01:13:41,460 --> 01:13:43,027
I'll wait for you in the car.

1081
01:13:48,336 --> 01:13:49,773
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

1082
01:13:49,903 --> 01:13:52,166
one will be appointed to you
by the court.

1083
01:13:52,297 --> 01:13:54,604
Do you understand the rights
I just read to you, sir?

1084
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:08,139
You know,
you're one lucky sonofabitch.

1085
01:14:09,401 --> 01:14:12,926
Those security cameras caught
him trying to run you down.

1086
01:14:13,057 --> 01:14:14,537
There's gonna be
a lot of red tape,

1087
01:14:14,667 --> 01:14:18,584
but, uh, it'll prove
it's self-defense.

1088
01:14:21,108 --> 01:14:22,414
Thanks for coming down.

1089
01:14:22,545 --> 01:14:23,937
Yeah, course.

1090
01:14:24,764 --> 01:14:27,288
You'd have done
exactly the same thing for me.

1091
01:14:29,508 --> 01:14:32,424
CSI found
two vials of fentanyl

1092
01:14:32,555 --> 01:14:34,121
in Devereaux's truck--

1093
01:14:34,252 --> 01:14:36,297
the same shit
that killed Finn.

1094
01:14:37,908 --> 01:14:39,170
They're calling it a homicide.

1095
01:14:40,737 --> 01:14:41,694
What?

1096
01:14:43,304 --> 01:14:45,698
Devereaux killed Finn?

1097
01:14:45,829 --> 01:14:47,221
For what?

1098
01:14:49,049 --> 01:14:51,182
Stop him IDing him
for Wieder's murder?

1099
01:14:51,312 --> 01:14:53,880
Sure. Makes sense.

1100
01:14:54,011 --> 01:14:56,709
No. No, it doesn't make
fuckin' sense.

1101
01:14:58,102 --> 01:14:59,625
In his own goddamn book,

1102
01:14:59,756 --> 01:15:03,368
Finn is pointing 100%
to Elizabeth Westlake,

1103
01:15:03,499 --> 01:15:04,500
not to Devereaux.

1104
01:15:08,155 --> 01:15:09,505
Something's not right.

1105
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:11,985
Yeah, something's not right.

1106
01:15:12,682 --> 01:15:14,553
Something's not right
with you, Roy.

1107
01:15:17,077 --> 01:15:20,254
Isaac Samuel
committed this act.

1108
01:15:21,081 --> 01:15:23,562
Isaac Samuel confessed to it.

1109
01:15:24,694 --> 01:15:26,173
In one month,

1110
01:15:27,044 --> 01:15:30,090
there will be justice
and he will be dead.

1111
01:15:31,091 --> 01:15:34,573
And you can move on
and forget about all this.

1112
01:15:48,282 --> 01:15:49,762
Was I a good cop?

1113
01:15:51,851 --> 01:15:54,114
Were you a good cop? What?

1114
01:15:54,245 --> 01:15:56,290
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1115
01:15:57,727 --> 01:15:59,424
Was I good at my job?

1116
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,687
Or was I a bad cop?
Was I a shit cop?

1117
01:16:01,818 --> 01:16:03,341
Was I a lazy sonofabitch

1118
01:16:03,471 --> 01:16:05,909
who just marked his card
and showed up?

1119
01:16:06,039 --> 01:16:09,347
Roy, you were one of the best.

1120
01:16:09,477 --> 01:16:11,262
You were a great cop.

1121
01:16:15,614 --> 01:16:18,574
My name's not on
any of the sign-offs.

1122
01:16:19,096 --> 01:16:20,097
What?

1123
01:16:20,227 --> 01:16:21,838
In the Wieder file.

1124
01:16:21,968 --> 01:16:25,276
My name is not on
any of the officials.

1125
01:16:26,190 --> 01:16:27,974
Not the incident report...

1126
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:30,542
not the witness sheet,

1127
01:16:30,673 --> 01:16:33,850
forensic findings,
Samuel's confession.

1128
01:16:33,980 --> 01:16:35,329
None of it.

1129
01:16:36,940 --> 01:16:38,332
It's just your name...

1130
01:16:39,856 --> 01:16:41,031
on all of it.

1131
01:16:42,423 --> 01:16:45,601
What are you trying
to say, Roy?

1132
01:16:47,341 --> 01:16:49,822
I've been going back through
30 years of case files.

1133
01:16:49,953 --> 01:16:51,171
Thirty years.

1134
01:16:51,781 --> 01:16:54,871
Every one, every document,
every single one...

1135
01:16:56,046 --> 01:16:57,743
we co-signed.

1136
01:16:57,874 --> 01:16:59,876
My name right next to yours.

1137
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:02,356
Except for this one.

1138
01:17:03,793 --> 01:17:05,446
Why is that?

1139
01:17:09,233 --> 01:17:11,627
I see what you're doing here,
Roy.

1140
01:17:13,498 --> 01:17:15,587
You've interviewed
everyone else.

1141
01:17:16,675 --> 01:17:18,677
Now you're gonna accuse me.

1142
01:17:20,636 --> 01:17:21,767
Jesus Christ, Roy,

1143
01:17:21,898 --> 01:17:24,030
you're some
fuckin' piece of work.

1144
01:17:24,770 --> 01:17:28,426
You come to my house
out of nowhere,

1145
01:17:28,556 --> 01:17:30,297
asking for my help,

1146
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:33,039
and now you accuse me?

1147
01:17:37,261 --> 01:17:38,741
Fuck you, Roy.

1148
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:41,569
Fuck you.

1149
01:19:28,589 --> 01:19:30,374
I ain't no killer!

1150
01:19:50,829 --> 01:19:52,570
You're in rare form tonight.

1151
01:19:54,180 --> 01:19:55,486
Where is she?

1152
01:19:55,616 --> 01:19:57,923
She won't be coming in
for a while, Roy.

1153
01:21:45,552 --> 01:21:47,424
- Okay.
- Uh-huh.

1154
01:21:49,252 --> 01:21:50,514
I'm out.

1155
01:21:50,644 --> 01:21:52,646
Oh, don't take my car, Roy.

1156
01:21:52,777 --> 01:21:54,997
Hey,
I will bring it back tomorrow.

1157
01:21:57,347 --> 01:22:01,438
What you did,
I will never forget.

1158
01:22:05,790 --> 01:22:06,747
Tomorrow.

1159
01:22:14,668 --> 01:22:16,583
We're not open yet.

1160
01:22:21,806 --> 01:22:23,939
Was there
an old gray-haired guy

1161
01:22:24,069 --> 01:22:25,201
used to run this place?

1162
01:22:25,331 --> 01:22:27,551
Eric? Eric O'Toole?

1163
01:22:27,681 --> 01:22:30,380
Yeah, he's retired. Is there
anything I can help you with?

1164
01:22:30,510 --> 01:22:32,034
It's my pop's place now.

1165
01:22:32,164 --> 01:22:34,819
Yeah, I'm looking for a woman
who used to work here too.

1166
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,953
- Her name's Diane.
- Oh, you mean Diane Lynch?

1167
01:22:38,083 --> 01:22:40,564
Yeah, right. Any idea
where I could find her?

1168
01:22:40,694 --> 01:22:43,001
Yeah, just over
at Calvary Catholic.

1169
01:22:44,220 --> 01:22:47,049
She died about five years ago.

1170
01:22:48,485 --> 01:22:50,008
Oh, you don't say?

1171
01:22:50,530 --> 01:22:52,315
Fuck.

1172
01:22:52,445 --> 01:22:54,230
Was she a friend
or something?

1173
01:22:54,360 --> 01:22:58,756
Eh, she gave a deposition
in a case I was working on.

1174
01:22:58,886 --> 01:23:00,976
- I was just following up.
- So, you a cop?

1175
01:23:01,106 --> 01:23:02,499
Used to be.

1176
01:23:03,630 --> 01:23:04,805
Well...

1177
01:23:06,024 --> 01:23:07,373
On me.

1178
01:23:08,548 --> 01:23:10,159
My grandfather was a cop.

1179
01:23:15,903 --> 01:23:18,819
I just recently remembered
I actually, uh...

1180
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:20,952
I like to do this.

1181
01:23:21,083 --> 01:23:22,388
Don't we all?

1182
01:23:23,868 --> 01:23:25,478
To Diane.

1183
01:23:31,963 --> 01:23:34,270
Hey.
You mind if I use your bathroom?

1184
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:36,663
Just around the corner,
other side of the jukebox.

1185
01:23:36,794 --> 01:23:37,838
Thanks.

1186
01:23:57,902 --> 01:23:59,512
Hello?
<i>Mr. Freeman?</i>

1187
01:23:59,643 --> 01:24:02,211
<i>It's Susan Avery
returning your call.</i>

1188
01:24:02,341 --> 01:24:04,474
Blunt object to the head.

1189
01:24:04,604 --> 01:24:07,955
Um, Susan?
<i>From Waterford College.</i>

1190
01:24:08,086 --> 01:24:10,132
<i>I have something for you.</i>

1191
01:24:16,747 --> 01:24:19,054
You sure I can't get you
a glass of water?

1192
01:24:19,184 --> 01:24:20,664
No, no, I'm fine.

1193
01:24:21,839 --> 01:24:23,754
You said you had something
for me?

1194
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:29,673
I don't know
where the original is.

1195
01:24:29,803 --> 01:24:31,631
Probably in storage at
the DOD, if I had to guess,

1196
01:24:31,762 --> 01:24:34,373
but that's the only copy
I had from my time there.

1197
01:24:34,504 --> 01:24:35,940
<i>The Mirror Effect.</i>

1198
01:24:36,071 --> 01:24:38,073
Wieder was quite proud
of this work.

1199
01:24:38,203 --> 01:24:39,509
He thought
it would help people

1200
01:24:39,639 --> 01:24:41,119
who were suffering
with their trauma.

1201
01:24:41,250 --> 01:24:42,816
- It's award-worthy research.
- It was never published?

1202
01:24:42,947 --> 01:24:44,731
At least not under his name.

1203
01:24:44,862 --> 01:24:46,907
I don't understand.

1204
01:24:48,170 --> 01:24:50,998
I gather
you haven't read her book.

1205
01:24:52,609 --> 01:24:54,393
She updated Wieder's research
with additional findings

1206
01:24:54,524 --> 01:24:55,612
she culled together
over the years

1207
01:24:55,742 --> 01:24:57,048
she was getting her doctorate.

1208
01:24:57,179 --> 01:24:58,702
So, she stole his work?

1209
01:24:58,832 --> 01:25:01,096
It happens all the time
in academic research.

1210
01:25:01,226 --> 01:25:03,272
Besides, who would protest?

1211
01:25:03,402 --> 01:25:05,970
- Wieder's dead.
- But you contracted it?

1212
01:25:06,101 --> 01:25:08,451
It's not as simple as that.

1213
01:25:08,581 --> 01:25:09,930
Before Wieder died,

1214
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:11,758
Laura Baines came to me
with that manuscript.

1215
01:25:11,889 --> 01:25:14,109
Yeah, I heard
she wasn't happy.

1216
01:25:14,239 --> 01:25:15,632
<i>She claimed the work
was hers.</i>

1217
01:25:15,762 --> 01:25:17,764
Wieder wasn't giving her
the credit she deserved.

1218
01:25:17,895 --> 01:25:21,072
This is bullshit! He can't
just get away with this!

1219
01:25:21,812 --> 01:25:23,161
So, how did she publish it?

1220
01:25:23,292 --> 01:25:24,510
We'd been circulating it

1221
01:25:24,641 --> 01:25:26,164
in a number
of the VA hospitals,

1222
01:25:26,295 --> 01:25:28,514
but the department's
priorities changed.

1223
01:25:28,645 --> 01:25:30,995
A few years later
after I started working here,

1224
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:32,649
I found her book review.

1225
01:25:32,779 --> 01:25:36,827
So... why didn't you
go after her?

1226
01:25:36,957 --> 01:25:39,003
There was nothing
to go after her for.

1227
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,918
The project was shuttered.

1228
01:25:44,878 --> 01:25:46,706
Wieder used to live
around here, right?

1229
01:25:46,837 --> 01:25:50,014
Over on Chestnut. Apparently
the house is still empty.

1230
01:26:26,181 --> 01:26:28,095
Blunt object to the head.

1231
01:26:31,925 --> 01:26:33,579
Any sign of it?

1232
01:26:33,710 --> 01:26:36,756
No. Couple of bats
in the garage, though.

1233
01:27:04,741 --> 01:27:06,395
One's missing, right?

1234
01:27:06,525 --> 01:27:09,093
Caretaker there said they were
all signed by Hall of Famers,

1235
01:27:09,224 --> 01:27:11,748
so probably worth
a lot of money.

1236
01:27:14,054 --> 01:27:15,491
You wanna go talk to him?

1237
01:27:15,621 --> 01:27:19,103
- I will. Come on.
- Sir.

1238
01:29:19,658 --> 01:29:21,443
What you got there, Roy?

1239
01:29:25,490 --> 01:29:27,100
Never did find
the murder weapon

1240
01:29:27,231 --> 01:29:29,538
from the Wieder case, did you?

1241
01:29:31,453 --> 01:29:32,802
You put this here?

1242
01:29:34,412 --> 01:29:35,935
Put it back
in the hole, Roy.

1243
01:29:46,163 --> 01:29:48,687
Both of youse, get inside.

1244
01:29:51,995 --> 01:29:54,954
Why couldn't you
just listen to me?

1245
01:29:55,085 --> 01:29:57,392
You just couldn't let it go,
could you?!

1246
01:29:59,045 --> 01:30:00,133
What did you do, Jim?

1247
01:30:00,264 --> 01:30:01,526
What did I do?

1248
01:30:02,484 --> 01:30:04,616
I cleaned this
fucking mess up.

1249
01:30:04,747 --> 01:30:08,141
Ten years ago. Don't you
remember any of this?

1250
01:30:08,272 --> 01:30:10,883
- What Diane did?
- Diane?

1251
01:30:11,623 --> 01:30:12,929
She told me what you knew.

1252
01:30:14,234 --> 01:30:15,366
Diane Lynch?

1253
01:30:15,497 --> 01:30:17,368
Get away from me!

1254
01:30:17,499 --> 01:30:19,022
From your favorite bar.

1255
01:30:19,152 --> 01:30:21,067
She was one of
Wieder's patients.

1256
01:30:21,198 --> 01:30:22,547
Enough, Laura.

1257
01:30:22,678 --> 01:30:25,245
I told you
I would take care of this.

1258
01:30:29,293 --> 01:30:30,599
Oh.

1259
01:30:33,166 --> 01:30:34,690
You know each other?

1260
01:30:38,084 --> 01:30:39,477
I see.

1261
01:30:39,608 --> 01:30:41,131
So, you're in this together?

1262
01:30:42,654 --> 01:30:44,569
Fuck me.[Roy] No, I get it.

1263
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:46,266
I get it, Jimmy.

1264
01:30:47,224 --> 01:30:48,921
Your wife got really sick.

1265
01:30:49,052 --> 01:30:50,270
You got deep in debt.

1266
01:30:50,401 --> 01:30:52,359
She comes along,
pays to you kill Wieder

1267
01:30:52,490 --> 01:30:54,231
so she can publish her book,

1268
01:30:54,361 --> 01:30:56,712
and you,
you railroad Isaac Samuel,

1269
01:30:56,842 --> 01:30:58,409
cover it all up.

1270
01:30:58,540 --> 01:31:01,717
No, no, no, no, no. I did not
pay him to kill Wieder.

1271
01:31:02,631 --> 01:31:05,329
We didn't meet until
after your accident.

1272
01:31:07,287 --> 01:31:09,028
<i>My life was destroyed.</i>

1273
01:31:10,073 --> 01:31:13,119
<i>I was facing losing
years of clinical research.</i>

1274
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:14,643
The name "Laura Baines"

1275
01:31:14,773 --> 01:31:17,080
would always be associated
with what happened.

1276
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:21,258
<i>Then your partner showed up,
asking all kinds of questions.</i>

1277
01:31:21,388 --> 01:31:23,086
<i>I didn't know what he wanted,
but he wouldn't let up</i>

1278
01:31:23,216 --> 01:31:24,696
<i>and I was so scared.</i>

1279
01:31:24,827 --> 01:31:26,263
Oh, fuck you, Laura!

1280
01:31:28,004 --> 01:31:31,355
So, I... left.

1281
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:34,401
I moved, changed my name,
started over,

1282
01:31:34,532 --> 01:31:37,404
completed the research
and published <i>my</i> book,

1283
01:31:37,535 --> 01:31:39,842
hoping I would
never see him again.

1284
01:31:39,972 --> 01:31:41,278
<i>But then, a few years ago,</i>

1285
01:31:41,408 --> 01:31:43,323
<i>Richard Finn
started poking around.</i>

1286
01:31:43,454 --> 01:31:46,675
She's an author.
Elizabeth Westlake.

1287
01:31:47,284 --> 01:31:49,547
But she changed it.
It used to be Laura Baines.

1288
01:31:49,678 --> 01:31:51,723
<i>She must have taken
Wieder's work after he died.</i>

1289
01:31:51,854 --> 01:31:54,291
<i>You ask me,
she's the one who killed him.</i>

1290
01:31:56,859 --> 01:31:58,425
<i>Then somehow,
your partner found me</i>

1291
01:31:58,556 --> 01:32:00,384
<i>and he turned up
with his hand out,</i>

1292
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:02,560
and this time, it's for money.

1293
01:32:02,691 --> 01:32:06,259
All this, all this is just
fucking bullshit, Roy.

1294
01:32:06,390 --> 01:32:09,219
I'm not lying.
He blackmailed me.

1295
01:32:09,349 --> 01:32:12,222
He said he'd go public with
proof my book wasn't my work

1296
01:32:12,352 --> 01:32:13,658
unless I paid him.

1297
01:32:15,312 --> 01:32:16,966
So, you killed
Richard Finn too

1298
01:32:17,096 --> 01:32:19,098
in case he got the same idea?

1299
01:32:19,229 --> 01:32:21,405
I didn't kill anyone.

1300
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:24,843
She killed Finn the same way
she killed Wieder.

1301
01:32:24,974 --> 01:32:27,454
Finn's writing a book
about the murder

1302
01:32:27,585 --> 01:32:29,892
and he thinks
you killed Wieder.

1303
01:32:30,022 --> 01:32:31,371
You need to talk to him.

1304
01:32:31,502 --> 01:32:33,635
<i>With other people's hands.</i>

1305
01:32:33,765 --> 01:32:34,853
Okay.

1306
01:32:34,984 --> 01:32:36,725
I'm telling you, Laura,

1307
01:32:36,855 --> 01:32:38,988
you can fuck around
all you want, but I'm not...

1308
01:32:39,118 --> 01:32:41,860
<i>Devereaux was
already a trained killer.</i>

1309
01:32:41,991 --> 01:32:44,471
<i>With Finn out of the way,
she got him to come after you.</i>

1310
01:32:44,602 --> 01:32:45,821
He's home.

1311
01:32:46,604 --> 01:32:49,651
Wait until he leaves
and then take care of it.

1312
01:32:52,479 --> 01:32:54,264
She's a manipulator, Roy.

1313
01:32:54,394 --> 01:32:57,528
She's manipulating you
right now.

1314
01:32:57,659 --> 01:33:00,531
She gets people to come in
and do her dirty work

1315
01:33:00,662 --> 01:33:02,315
and then she just skates away.

1316
01:33:03,447 --> 01:33:05,362
She has to be
held accountable.

1317
01:33:14,197 --> 01:33:19,158
Hm, it's such a funny thing,
the mind,

1318
01:33:19,289 --> 01:33:21,813
the things it can live with

1319
01:33:21,944 --> 01:33:24,599
and the things
it just can't bear.

1320
01:33:25,556 --> 01:33:26,949
To get to die
ignorant of both,

1321
01:33:27,079 --> 01:33:28,515
now that...

1322
01:33:28,646 --> 01:33:31,823
Oh, that is
a special kind of bliss.

1323
01:34:05,988 --> 01:34:08,468
What I did...

1324
01:34:11,254 --> 01:34:13,473
I did for you.

It seems the treatment's

1376
01:38:45,267 --> 01:38:48,400
