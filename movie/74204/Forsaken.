1
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,000
片名：《遗弃》

2
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,211
你妈妈去世了
Your mother is dead.

3
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,290
我不知道她死了
I did not know that she had passed.

4
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:49,322
你怎会不知道？
How could you?

5
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:58,768
如果我知道她生病了，我会...
If I had known that she had been sick, I'd have...

6
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,922
你会做什么？
You would've done what?

7
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:04,370
如果你知道她快去世了，你会回家吗？
You would've come home if you knew she was dying?

8
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:07,245
但是，在她还活着的时候你没有回家
But you couldn't come home when she was living,

9
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,005
当她还满怀着希望的时候？
when she was full of hope?

10
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:23,641
她怎么死的？
How did she pass?

11
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:30,601
在我怀里
In my arms,

12
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,690
就躺在我身边
lying beside me in bed.

13
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,562
哭泣着
Weeping

14
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,371
喊着你的名字
Calling out your name.

15
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,529
这是你来这里待几天的原因吗？
Is it your plan to stay a while?

16
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,362
也不是
Not sure yet.

17
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,362
你没带枪
You don't wear guns.

18
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,570
我收起来了，我不想再用了
I put them away. I'm done with that.

19
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,728
哼！
Hm!

20
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,407
那是什么意思？
What is that supposed to mean?

21
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,202
意思是，一个人的本性不是那么容易改变的
It means I don't know if a man can get away from who he is.

22
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:17,091
那你觉得你了解我
And you think you know who I am?

23
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,441
我觉得我了解
I thought I did.

24
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,479
我一会儿回来，我要进趟城
I'll be back. I have to go into town.

25
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,482
我和你一起去
I'll go with ya.

26
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,559
哦，早上好，牧师
Oh, morning, Reverend.

27
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,485
我会尽快招呼你，嗯， 那位先生，我会尽快...
And I'll be right with, uh, you, sir, just as soon as I...

28
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,291
上帝啊！约翰 亨利，是你吗？
Lord sakes! John Henry, is that you?

29
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,289
你好，帕森先生
Hello, Mr. Parsons.

30
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,402
上帝啊，约翰 亨利
Lord almighty, John Henry.

31
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:08,410
从战争爆发我就没见过你了
I ain't seen you since you went off to war.

32
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,171
我在酒吧从夏安那里订了一些
I asked the saloon to order some sipping cider

33
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,169
苹果酒
from Cheyenne for me.

34
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,328
你看看到了没有？
Would you see if it's arrived please?

35
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,408
再见，帕森先生
Mr. Parsons.

36
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,007
你一定很高兴再次见到了你的儿子
Must do your heart good to see the boy again.

37
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,487
我要的东西
I have a list.

38
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,568
克莱顿牧师让我来取他的苹果酒
Reverend Clayton sent me to pick up his cider.

39
00:10:37,640 --> 00:10:38,640
你又是谁呢？
And who are you?

40
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,921
他的儿子，约翰 亨利
His son, John Henry.

41
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:52,169
哇，哇，哇
Well, well, well.

42
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,599
这不是约翰 亨利 克莱顿吗
If it ain't John Henry Clayton.

43
00:10:56,600 --> 00:11:00,082
我听过你很多事情
I heard a lot about you.

44
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,687
我叫弗兰克 蒂尔曼
Name's Frank Tillman.

45
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,882
也许你听说过我？
Maybe you heard of me?

46
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,639
我不认识
Can't say as I have.

47
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:13,565
嗯，我杀过4个人
Well, uh, I killed four men.

48
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,361
还是想不起来
Still don't ring a bell.

49
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,639
你怎么没带枪？
How come you ain't wearing a gun?

50
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,804
你离开后，嗯，是信教了还是怎么了？
You go and, uh, get religion or something?

51
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,527
别纠缠我的客人
Stop pestering our guests.

52
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:38,564
蠢货
Git.

53
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,806
我是戴夫 特纳
My name is Dave Turner.

54
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,969
大家都叫我戴夫绅士
Some call me Gentleman Dave.

55
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,051
是的，我听说过你
Yeah, I heard of you.

56
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,679
你不要介意我的伙伴
You're gonna have to forgive my compatriots.

57
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:07,679
他们有时候很令人讨厌
Boredom often gets the best of 'em.

58
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,129
我很有幸几年前在科德韦尔县
I had the good fortune of watching you rid this world

59
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:15,210
看见你干掉了
Of Big Jim Westfield

60
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:18,927
吉姆 韦斯特菲尔德
down in Coldwell County a few years back.

61
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,089
让人印象深刻啊
Most impressive.

62
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,205
我可以问问你为什么来福勒镇吗？
May I ask what brings you to Fowler?

63
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:36,641
我只是想弄清我们之间的关系
I'm only trying to ascertain the nature of our relationship.

64
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:39,724
我不希望有什么麻烦
I'm hoping there won't be any trouble.

65
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,451
我没有麻烦
Not from me.

66
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,042
我不记得这里这么热闹啊
I don't recall things being so prosperous.

67
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,049
是很热闹
Prosperous to some.

68
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,128
快修铁路了
Railroads coming.

69
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,650
伙计，快装货啊
Buggy's not gonna load itself.

70
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,161
拿着
Take these.

71
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:11,886
拿住了，别马上就花光了
Take this. Don't you spend it all at once.

72
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,889
麦柯迪先生
Mr. McCurdy,

73
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,971
猜猜5分钟前谁来了？
guess who was just in here not five minutes ago?

74
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,765
约翰 亨利 克莱顿
John Henry Clayton.

75
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,688
他惹什么麻烦了吗？
Is he gonna be a problem?

76
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,445
他没有闹事
He didn't look too tough to me.

77
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,245
我没问你
I'm not asking you.

78
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,487
他会是麻烦吗？
Is he gonna be a problem?

79
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,444
他没带枪
He was not wearing a sidearm.

80
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,643
那不意味着他以后不会带
That doesn't mean he can't put one on.

81
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,326
如果他在这事上和他老爸想法一致
If he takes his pa's side in this,

82
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,808
那可能就是个麻烦
it could be a problem.

83
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:51,803
好吧
Well,

84
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:55,930
你为什么不都交给我来处理？
why don't you just leave all that to me?

85
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:05,049
他们在这里干什么？
What are they doing here?

86
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,731
你不知道？
You don't know?

87
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,531
我怎会知道？
How would I?

88
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:12,529
我觉得也许因为你来了
I thought maybe your coming here

89
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:14,927
和他们有关
might have something to do with them.

90
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,927
不会吧
Well, it don't.

91
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,600
他们为麦柯迪卖命
They work for McCurdy.

92
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,486
他想买下这里所有的农场
He got his mind set on buying every farm around here.

93
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,728
如果谁不想卖
Folks who don't wanna sell,

94
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:34,721
他们就会去做说服工作
they got some persuading from those fellas over there.

95
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:38,003
如果你不认识他们，你最好离他们远一点
If you don't know 'em, you better stay away from them.

96
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:40,248
他们都是些坏人
Those are damned men.

97
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,880
他们都是些混蛋
Those are godless men.

98
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,129
你明天打算去教堂吗？
Is it your plan to come to church tomorrow?

99
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,210
这是邀请我吗，爸爸？
Is that an invitation, Pa?

100
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,328
给我回来！
Come back here!

101
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,085
你回来到底是为了什么？
What is the reason you came home?

102
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:25,090
我不知道我还得有个理由，爸爸
I didn't know I had to have a reason, Pa.

103
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,885
如果你想让我离开，那我就走
If you want me to go, I'll go.

104
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:31,487
我是个直率的人，你让我很难堪
I'm a forthright man. You're an embarrassment to me.

105
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,400
今天在镇子上，我感到很羞愧
Today in there, all I felt was shame.

106
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:37,966
但是如果你回来是信奉上帝的
But if you come back committed to God

107
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,962
想真正改变你的人生
to truly change your ways,

108
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:43,283
那么根据上帝的旨意，我会原谅你的
then it's God's edict that I forgive you and I do.

109
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,482
但是一想起你妈妈
But in your mother's name

110
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,126
我就无法原谅你过去的十年
I cannot forget the past 10 years.

111
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:50,811
我不能
I cannot

112
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,571
我知道
I know.

113
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,083
你究竟在干什么？
What in the world are you doing?

114
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:41,450
妈妈总是想让我们把这块地清理出来
Ma always wanted us to clear this field together.

115
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,245
你和我？ 不，她没说
You and me? No, she didn't.

116
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:47,011
我记得，这是她唯一要求我们做的一件事
As far as I recall it's the only thing she ever asked of us.

117
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:50,039
没和我说过
Not me.

118
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:52,088
好吧，我自己来
Fine. I'll do it alone.

119
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:54,521
好吧
All right.

120
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,569
<i>我会失去信心</i>
<i>I would have lost heart</i>

121
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:06,886
<i>如果我不相信</i>
<i>if I had not believed</i>

122
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,039
<i>我会看见美好的上帝之光</i>
<i>that I would see the goodness of the Lord's light.</i>

123
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,486
<i>要有勇气</i>
<i>Be of good courage</i>

124
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,285
<i>上帝会给你力量的</i>
<i>and he shall give you strength.

125
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,440
抱歉
Excuse me.

126
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:30,641
先生们
Gentleman.

127
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:36,084
我们觉得我们应该雇佣些枪手
We think we should bring in our own hired guns.

128
00:18:36,085 --> 00:18:38,082
是的
That's right. Yep.

129
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:43,405
雇佣枪手，干什么呢？开战？杀戮？
Hired gun. To do what? Start a war? Kill everyone?

130
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:45,409
用枪解决不了问题
Guns are not the answer.

131
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:48,083
自从赫顿警长半夜逃走之后
Ever since Sheriff Hutton ran off in the middle of night,

132
00:18:48,084 --> 00:18:49,923
麦柯迪和他的同党更加猖狂了
McCurdy and his boys been getting bolder.

133
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:51,960
上星期强迫提姆 富勒卖了地
Forced Tim Fuller off his land last week.

134
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,081
现在他们在威胁彼得斯
Now they're threatening Peterson.

135
00:18:53,082 --> 00:18:55,079
他们来到我们的家乡
They come on my land,

136
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,287
他们要来面对我10mm口径的枪口
they'll be looking to the wrong end of my 10 gauge.

137
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,689
等一下，丹尼尔，我已经给美国的马歇尔发了电报
Wait, Daniel. Wait. I've wired the U.S. Marshall.

138
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,848
我们会得到支持的
We will have the law on our side.

139
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,849
我们是穷人
We're poor.

140
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:09,169
法律什么时候关心过我们这样的人啊？
When has the law ever cared about folks like us?

141
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,608
没人会来的
No one's comin'.

142
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,121
牧师
Reverend.

143
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,888
停下
Whoa.

144
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,162
停下
Whoa.

145
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:40,690
玛丽 爱丽丝
Mary Alice.

146
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:43,371
听教堂的人说你回来了
Heard people say in church you were back.

147
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,369
不敢相信
Didn't believe it.

148
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:48,802
我要亲自来看看
Needed to come out and see for myself.

149
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,210
我几天前回来的
I've been back a few days or so.

150
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:57,041
回来几天了也不来看看我？
A few days and you haven't come and seen me?

151
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,402
我想去的，但是...
I planned on it, I just...

152
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,164
你总是说谎
You always were a terrible liar.

153
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,561
我一直期待这一天
I waited for this day.

154
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:18,682
想一想
Thought about it.

155
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,565
该说些什么
Planned what I might say.

156
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,764
现在却不知道怎么说了
Now I don't know what to say.

157
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,970
你自己清理的？
You clearing all this by yourself?

158
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:37,447
是的
Yes, ma'am.

159
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,848
这活儿对于一个人来说可不少啊
Lot of work for one man.

160
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:45,203
如果你想帮忙的话，铁锹就在那边
Shovel right over there if you care to help.

161
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,323
你看起来不错
You look well.

162
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,480
你也是
<i>So do you.</i>

163
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,842
我发誓，你和我走之前一样好看
I swear you look the same as the day I left.

164
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,849
你又说谎了
Now there you go lying again.

165
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,849
我不记得你
I don't recall you being

166
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,849
这么不信任我我，玛丽 爱丽丝
so distrustful of folks, Mary Alice.

167
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,088
我从没对你撒过谎
I'd never lie to you.

168
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:10,164
我记得你说过战争一结束
Well, I seem to recall you saying something about

169
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,562
你就回来
coming back after the war.

170
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:26,211
那么你还是回去干活吧
Well, I better let you get back to your work.

171
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:30,801
也许我处理好之后，我们可以像以前一样
Maybe after I get settled we could ride out to the bluffs

172
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,809
骑马到悬崖那里
like we used to.

173
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:35,241
这可不行了
That wouldn't be right.

174
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:39,163
我已经结婚了
I'm married.

175
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,163
结婚了？
Married?

176
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:43,279
都8年了
Going on eight years now.

177
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,329
我有个儿子叫查理
I have a little boy, Charlie.

178
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:49,489
我以为你知道的
I thought you knew.

179
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:54,128
不，我不知道
No. No, I did not know that.

180
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,609
我等过你的
I waited for you.

181
00:21:56,720 --> 00:22:00,042
但是，过去太久了，一直没有你的消息...
But when the years passed and there was no word and...

182
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,289
玛丽 爱丽丝，你不必向我解释
Mary Alice, you do not owe me an explanation.

183
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,681
你嫁给谁了？
Who did you marry?

184
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:16,168
汤姆 沃森
Tom Watson.

185
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,208
汤姆 沃森是个不错的家伙
Tom's a good man.

186
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,324
是的，没错
Yes, he is.

187
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:31,325
欢迎回来，约翰 亨利
Welcome home, John Henry.

188
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:49,481
我操！
Shit!

189
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,969
好了，带它们进去
All right. Bring 'em in, come on.

190
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:40,165
我操...丹尼尔！
What the... Dan!

191
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,080
我们正要去拜访你呢
We was just coming to pay you a visit.

192
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:47,399
省得我们跑路了
Appreciate you saving us a ride.

193
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,244
我和你没什么可说的
I've got nothing to say to you.

194
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,408
好吧
Oh well,

195
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,568
我有话和你说
I got something to say to you.

196
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,439
够了
That's enough.

197
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,967
你不是想杀了他吧？
You don't wanna kill him now, do ya?

198
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,321
也许我...
Well maybe I do. I...

199
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,410
我还没想好
I hadn't decided yet.

200
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:41,445
我送他回家
I'm taking him home.

201
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,442
哦，稍等
Uh, hold on there now.

202
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,444
轮不到你做决定
It ain't you who's doing the deciding.

203
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,125
我可以送他回家吗？
May I take him home?

204
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:55,529
如果我说不？你打算怎么着？
And what if I say no? What you gonna do about it?

205
00:24:57,680 --> 00:24:59,569
不怎么着
Nothing.

206
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,439
抱歉，我没听清楚
I'm sorry. I didn't quite hear that.

207
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:04,886
不怎么着
Nothing.

208
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,171
好吧，约翰 亨利
All right, John Henry.

209
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,484
你得到我的许可了，可以带他回家了
You have my permission to take him home.

210
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,051
有什么事让你烦恼了？
Somethings troubling you?

211
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,810
你妈妈和我经常问自己
Your mother and I kept asking ourselves,

212
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:57,127
问上帝
asking God,

213
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:00,762
我们对你的教育有什么失误？
what we done wrong in your upbringing?

214
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,611
我们做了什么让你有这么多仇恨？
What did we do that filled you with so much hate?

215
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,531
和你无关
It weren't you.

216
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:13,930
约翰 8:32，还记得吗？
John 8:32, remember?

217
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,520
真理会释放你
The truth will set you free.

218
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,523
上帝知道真理
God knows the truth.

219
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,519
战争里我常问自己，上帝到底在哪里？
All through the war I kept asking myself, where was God?

220
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,966
当人们战死的时候
Where was he at Shiloh and Seven Pines

221
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,969
夏伊洛和派因斯在哪里？
when men lay dead and dying?

222
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:30,050
都是些好人，都是很虔诚的人
All good men, God-fearing men.

223
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:33,562
他们就躺在那里，乞求一点点的
They just lay there, begging for some small act of mercy

224
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,847
仁慈
on His behalf.

225
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:40,090
最后我算是明白了
And then it finally dawned on me:

226
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,208
根本就没有什么上帝
There ain't no God.

227
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:46,925
根本没有上帝？
There is no God?

228
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,003
我所要说的是，人们需要上帝的时候
All I'm saying is that if there was ever a time

229
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:53,011
他并不在那里
that man needed God it was then and trust me, he wasn't there.

230
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,563
如果你期待上帝能救你，但是他没有
If you're expecting God to save you, he ain't gonna.

231
00:26:55,564 --> 00:26:58,848
大多数上过战场的人
Most men came out of that war wanting nothing more

232
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,247
都不想继续杀戮了，但是你
to do with killing, but not you.

233
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,930
你喜欢杀戮
You went looking for it.

234
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:05,566
上帝并不为你自己选择的人生负责
God is not responsible for the life you choose.

235
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:07,927
不是我自己选择的！
I did not choose it!

236
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,001
离开我的土地
Get off my land.

237
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:47,327
我们来继续完成
We just come to finish the conversation

238
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:49,727
被你打断的谈话，丹尼尔
that was interrupted, Dan.

239
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,450
别让我们搞的不愉快
Let us avoid unpleasantness.

240
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:04,884
先生，我希望你能明白
Sir, I implore you to see reason.

241
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:10,245
如果你看看你自己的形势，你就会
If you take a fair grasp of your situation, you will arrive

242
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:12,647
做出合理的选择
at the only reasonable conclusion available to you.

243
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,722
我坚持
I'm stayin'.

244
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,680
泥土和石头
Dirt and rock.

245
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:34,648
这样的泥土和石头你可以在任何地方找到
Exactly like the dirt and the rocks you would find anywhere.

246
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:38,691
是的，但是这是属于我的泥土和石头！
Yeah, but it's my dirt and my rock!

247
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,679
是的，是很好的石头
Yes, and a fine rock it is too.

248
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,251
值得去死吗？
Is worth dying over?

249
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,681
你相信你老婆宁愿要这些泥土和石头
You believe your wife would prefer the dirt

250
00:28:46,682 --> 00:28:49,679
而不需要你吗？
and the rock to you?

251
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,679
它能让你老婆睡的温暖
Will this keep her warm at night

252
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:56,605
或者把食物放到桌子上吗？
or put the food on the table?

253
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,968
它能教你孩子如何做人吗？
Is it gonna teach your children right from wrong?

254
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:02,679
当遇到狂风来临的时候
Comfort them in their beds

255
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:07,083
能在床边安抚他们吗？
when they're frightened by the wind?

256
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,719
你看，我明白
You see, I do understand.

257
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,849
我非常明白这对你
I do understand. I truly do understand the inequities

258
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:15,008
不公平，先生
of your position, sir,

259
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,886
但是，我相信你会做出合适的选择
but I believe when you weigh the alternatives,

260
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,083
你会明白...
you will see that...

261
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,765
没这个这样做
There was no need for that.

262
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:34,726
我们在谈话
We were talking.

263
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:37,690
看起来你们的谈话结束了，戴夫
It would appear the conversation's over now, Dave.

264
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,683
他就要明白了
He was about to see reason.

265
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,842
你没杀过人吧，戴夫
You actually ever kill anybody, Dave,

266
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:45,521
或者你用嘴杀人的？
or you just talk 'em to death?

267
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:55,765
其他人还要说什么吗？
Anybody else have something to say?

268
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,727
<i>丹尼尔 彼得斯...</i>
<i>Daniel Peterson...</i>

269
00:30:06,800 --> 00:30:10,930
现在安全的来到了上帝的怀抱
is now safely in the embrace of our Lord.

270
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:17,730
但是对于我们活着的人来说，一个好人被杀害了
But for us, here on earth, a good man has been taken.

271
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:23,489
一个家庭的户主，我们的朋友
A provider for his family, a friend to our community,

272
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:29,323
很让我们绝望，我要责问上帝
and in our despair, we rail against God.

273
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:35,209
我们的信仰在接受考验，到了它的极限
Our faith is tested, pushed to its very limits.

274
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,530
但是全能的上帝有他的目的
But Almighty God has a purpose.

275
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,803
我们尽管很愚昧
And senseless though it may seem to us,

276
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:48,324
凡人不应该质疑上帝的智慧
it is not for mere mortal man to question God's wisdom.

277
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:52,809
我们只能坚持走正义的道路
It is for us to persevere in a righteous way.

278
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,680
- 我们需要做点事情 - 比如什么？
- We gotta do something. - Like what?

279
00:30:56,800 --> 00:30:58,370
- 我不知道，我们不能这样无所作为
- I don't know. We can't sit around doing nothing.

280
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,766
再找一位警长？
What about getting a sheriff?

281
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:02,571
我们试过了，多数人都无法容忍这样的斗争
We tried. Most men ain't got the stomach for a fight like this.

282
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,921
我们需要一无畏的人能应对麻烦
We need a man who knows trouble, a man who others fear.

283
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,284
你觉得他能帮助我们吗？
You suppose he might come to our aid?

284
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:10,967
别妄想了
Put that out of your head right now.

285
00:31:11,080 --> 00:31:13,765
我们可以付钱啊，我们有集资，现在有200美元
We could pay him. Took a collection. We got $200.

286
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,842
他不再过那种生活了
He's done with that life.

287
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,248
我真无法相信，詹姆士让事情到了这个地步
I can't believe James would let it come to this.

288
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:22,126
他们杀害了丹尼尔 彼得斯
They killed Daniel Peterson.

289
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,890
我一直不认为他们会杀害我们的人
I never thought they'd kill one of us.

290
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,650
这只会越来越糟的
It's only gonna get worse.

291
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,161
你为什么这样说？
What makes you say that?

292
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:30,971
因为有了第一个，以后就更好办了
'Cause after the first one, it gets easier.

293
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,839
要吃点吗？不错的烤牛排
You want something? They heat up a good steak.

294
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,241
不了，谢谢
No, thank you.

295
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,767
彼得斯先生来这里把他在
Mrs. Peterson came in and sold me her farm

296
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:45,881
镇子外的房子卖给了我
on the way out of town.

297
00:31:45,882 --> 00:31:49,248
其他两家也想卖了
Two other families wanna sell also.

298
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:53,001
我要说的是，用些强硬的办法
What I'm saying is, it looks like a more aggressive approach

299
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,647
对当地人更有效果
is having an effect on the locals.

300
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,962
克莱顿杀了那个人
Clyde murdered that man.

301
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,562
我听说的是，彼得斯当时拿着散弹枪
From what I heard, Peterson was holding a shotgun.

302
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:08,765
我来这里不是想成为一个谋杀犯
I did not come here to be part of a pack of murderers.

303
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,883
你以为发生了什么，戴夫？嗯，什么？
What the fuck did ya think was gonna happen Dave, huh? What?

304
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:16,771
你以为我带你来这里是让你用花言巧语诱骗他们交出土地吗？
You think I brought you hereto sweet-talk folk off their land?

305
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,087
别这样，戴夫
Oh come on, Dave, please.

306
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:22,044
我想让弗兰克来处理
I want Frank to take care of things

307
00:32:22,160 --> 00:32:24,561
农场收购的事情
when it comes to the farms.

308
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,490
他看起来挺有冲劲的
He seems to have the temperament required.

309
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:29,920
那我呢？
And me?

310
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,361
哦，我还是要你待在这里
Oh, I still want you here.

311
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,960
我相信约翰 亨利 克莱顿
I believe it's only a matter of time

312
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:39,449
早晚还是会拿起枪来惹麻烦的
before John Henry Clayton picks up his guns.

313
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,890
听说我们明天要去搞定查德威克的农场
Hear we're riding to the Chadwick farm tomorrow.

314
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,406
你为什么不站在吧台上
Why don't you just stand up on the bar

315
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,364
向大家宣布我们的行动？
and announce our intention to all creation?

316
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:03,849
抱歉，可能是我太兴奋了
Sorry, guess my enthusiasm got the better of me.

317
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,401
你今天打算吃饭吗？
You planning to eat today?

318
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:25,925
我不饿
Ain't hungry.

319
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,924
- 需要吃饭啊  - 告诉你了，我不饿
Need to eat. Told you, I ain't hungry.

320
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,925
你是要证明什么吗
You're trying to prove something out here.

321
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,441
我没想证明什么
I ain't trying to prove nothing.

322
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:35,800
是的，你有
Yes, you are.

323
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:40,685
你在这里没日没夜的干活
You're working this land day in, day out.

324
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:43,485
你很虚弱了，到了晚上，你就动不了了
You're so weary, time night comes, you can barely move.

325
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,328
你这不是在干活儿
It's not for love of farming.

326
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,999
我知道为什么
I know why it is.

327
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,128
你想用这片贫瘠的土地
You're trying to use this poor earth

328
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:53,562
发泄你的罪行和怒火
to sweat out all your guilt and anger.

329
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,969
是这样吗？
That's what it is, isn't it?

330
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:57,769
不
No.

331
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,080
是因为你不相信我，爸爸，别这样想
Just because you don't believe me, Pa, don't make it so.

332
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:03,004
我告诉过你，我做这些是因为妈妈希望的
I told you I'm doing this because Ma wanted it.

333
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,125
你妈妈希望的是你战后能回来
What your mother wanted was for you to come back from the war.

334
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:10,369
那你呢，爸爸？
What about you, Pa?

335
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,801
你希望我回来吗？
Did you want me to come back?

336
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,330
很简单的一个问题
Simple enough question.

337
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,011
我没从战场上回来让你烦恼了吗？
Did it even bother you that I didn't come back after the war?

338
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:20,609
你在说什么啊？
What are you talking about?

339
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:23,004
我要说的是，自从我弟弟威廉姆死的那天之后
I'm talking about the day you turned your back on me,

340
00:34:23,005 --> 00:34:24,889
你不理睬我了
the day my brother, William, died.

341
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:27,324
不是这样的
That's not true.

342
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,250
妈妈看出来了，那你觉得她为什么让我们
Ma saw it. Why the hell do you think she

343
00:34:30,360 --> 00:34:31,930
把这里清理出来？
wanted us to clear this field together?

344
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,724
她试图帮助我们化解这些事情
She tried to help us put things right.

345
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,929
没什么需要化解的啊
There was nothing to put right.

346
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,761
我还记得很清楚，就像昨天的事情一样
I remember it as if it was yesterday.

347
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:45,565
詹金斯先生看见了威廉姆和我在河边
Mr. Jenkins came across William and I down river.

348
00:34:45,680 --> 00:34:47,045
他把我们拉上来
Somehow he managed to drag us out of there,

349
00:34:47,046 --> 00:34:48,201
带我们去了他的小屋
get us up to his cabin.

350
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,006
他让他的孩子去找你
He told his boy to go fetch you.

351
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:55,721
我又冷有怕，不停的发抖
I was so cold and scared I couldn't stop shaking.

352
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,763
你来了之后，我听见詹金斯先生试图给你解释
When you arrived, I could hear Mr. Jenkins trying to explain

353
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:59,644
你有一个儿子死去了
to you that one of your sons had passed.

354
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,047
你还没问名字就冲进来
Before you could get the name out you rushed in

355
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,970
看见了我
and you saw me.

356
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:06,366
我一直无法忘记
And I'll never forget it.

357
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,609
你满脸失望的样子
The look of disappointment on your face.

358
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,405
你怎么会这样想？
How could you think such a thing?

359
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:15,648
我说错了吗？
Am I wrong?

360
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:20,090
我没有感到失望
I didn't feel any disappointment, far from it.

361
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:23,361
但是，恕我直言
But I would be a liar

362
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:27,201
我后来的确对你有些失望
if I said to you I haven't felt it since.

363
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:31,079
当我听说你的一些事情后
When word came back about your exploits,

364
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:33,765
我不得不想
I couldn't help but think

365
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,167
如果威廉姆还活着会做的更好
William might've made more of his life.

366
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,525
是的
Yeah.

367
00:36:29,840 --> 00:36:31,808
查德威克
Chadwick!

368
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:48,768
有埋伏！
It's an ambush!

369
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:44,001
他们怎么知道我们要来的？
How the hell they know we was coming?

370
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:46,009
也许他们听说了
Maybe they heard ya.

371
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,249
这也无法解释为什么有那么多枪手等着我们
That don't explain why there's so many guns waiting for us.

372
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:51,322
刚听说，查德威克连夜赶到兰德
Just heard Chadwick rode through the night

373
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,886
带来了他的亲戚
and came back with his kin from Landers.

374
00:37:54,040 --> 00:37:56,771
他是怎么知道这些事情的？
What would prompt him to do such a thing?

375
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,245
这家伙那天大嘴巴
That one flapped his gum so loud the other day

376
00:38:14,246 --> 00:38:17,687
肯定有人听见他说话了，告诉了他们我们的计划
someone must've heard and warned 'em we was coming.

377
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,087
丹 汤普森是个好伙计
Dan Thompson was a good man;

378
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:23,090
被这家伙的愚蠢行为给害死了
Died 'cause of that one's foolishness.

379
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:30,051
让他去吧
Ah, let him bleed out.

380
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:49,926
那块地弄的怎样了？
How's the field coming?

381
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:53,284
树差不多都砍完了
Almost all the trees are down.

382
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,688
很快就是一块很好的土地了
Should start working the land pretty soon.

383
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,043
那么花了你这么大的力气
So I take it with all the effort you're putting in

384
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,447
你打算在这里常住了
that you're planning on staying.

385
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,319
不确定呢
Not sure yet.

386
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,322
为什么？
Why's that?

387
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:12,170
还不知道哪里适合我
Don't exactly know where I fit in.

388
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,319
这里是你的家乡啊
This is your home.

389
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:17,369
这里不适合你，哪里适合呢？
If a man can't fit in here, where can he?

390
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:26,240
你想过战后你回来
You ever thought about what it might've been

391
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,891
会是什么样子吗？
if you'd come back after the war?

392
00:39:33,320 --> 00:39:36,319
那么你压根就没想过？
So you never thought about it?

393
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:40,245
我已经不是当时的我了
I ain't the same as the man that left all them years back.

394
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:44,245
我需要知道你为什么不回来
I need to understand why you didn't come back.

395
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:47,091
我觉得我有权利知道
I think I'm entitled to that much.

396
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:55,209
我说了
I'll say this,

397
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:58,085
我不想再说这个话题了
and I will say no more on the subject.

398
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:00,806
想着能回到你的身边
The thought of coming back to you

399
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:04,521
是我在战争里想着的唯一的事情
was the only thing that got me through that damn war.

400
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:08,406
当战争结束时，我对天发誓
And when it was over, I swear to you on my life,

401
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:11,842
我试图回来的
I tried coming home.

402
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,685
我发誓不再杀戮
I swore I was done with killing.

403
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,923
她却不肯放过我
She just wasn't done with me.

404
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,446
还记得你离开的那天吗？
You remember the day you left?

405
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:43,282
我给了你一个我的红丝带
I gave you a red ribbon from my hair.

406
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,722
告诉你，留着它直到你回来
Told you to hold onto it till you could bring it back to me.

407
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:49,850
是的，我记得
Yes, I remember.

408
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:53,362
你还留着吗？
You still have it?

409
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,568
这很重要吗？
Does it matter?

410
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,883
我想知道
I'd like to know.

411
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:11,603
你已经嫁给汤姆了，玛丽 爱丽丝
You were right to marry Tom, Mary Alice.

412
00:41:13,400 --> 00:41:15,482
你是对的
You were right.

413
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,081
你要见我？
You wanted to see me?

414
00:41:36,440 --> 00:41:38,647
我给了你一个简单的任务
I set you a simple task.

415
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:41,923
你解释一下你接受了任务后
You wanna explain to me how you took that task

416
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:44,566
是如何搞砸的吗？
and fucked it up in every conceivable way?

417
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,250
嗯...
Mmm...

418
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,886
我觉得一切还好啊
well I think everything's all right.

419
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,889
一切还好
Everything's all right.

420
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,844
你已经导致两个人死掉了...其中一个还是你杀的...
You got two men dead... One by your own hand...

421
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:56,088
查德威克依然还在他的土地上
Chadwick's still on his land,

422
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:58,481
也许我没有你聪明，但是就我看来
and I may not be as clever as you, but to my way of thinking

423
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,487
怎么也不意味着一切还好
no way that adds up to all right.

424
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:05,807
如果事情不能迅速解决
If these things aren't dealt with quickly,

425
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,088
很可能节外生枝
it could give the others ideas.

426
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,124
我可不希望这些蠢货
The last thing we need is these muddle heads

427
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,607
以为他们能和我们对抗
thinking they can stand up to us.

428
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:30,289
后悔嫁给我了？
Regret marrying me?

429
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:33,728
你这是说些什么啊？
What kind of question is that?

430
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:37,049
我今天早上看见约翰 亨利了
I seen John Henry here earlier today.

431
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,521
那又怎样？
so?

432
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,730
我知道你对他有感情
So, I know how you felt about him.

433
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:47,686
那都是陈年往事了
That was a long time ago.

434
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:01,290
你现在是我的丈夫，汤姆
You're my husband, Tom.

435
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,041
我没有后悔
I have no regrets.

436
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,128
我很抱歉你丈夫的去世
I'm sorry for your loss.

437
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,965
不，你不遗憾
No, you ain't.

438
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,327
总有一天...
Eventually...

439
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:51,569
有人会站出来对抗你们的
someone's gonna have the nerve to stand up to you.

440
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,325
当那天到来的时候
And when that day comes,

441
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:58,411
我会再回来，往你的坟墓
上吐口水的
I want to be here to spit on your grave.

442
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,408
好吧，夫人，你随便吧
Well, ma'am, feel free to do so.

443
00:45:04,520 --> 00:45:09,686
但愿你能找到地方
Provided you can find your way to the front of the line.

444
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,165
哦，20磅的种子和盐
Uh, 20 pounds of seed, salt.

445
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:17,647
我来付钱
I'll settle the account.

446
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:18,642
好的，牧师
All right, Reverend.

447
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,487
我有点忙，你不介意我插个队吧？
In a bit of a hurry. You don't mind if I cut in here, do ya?

448
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:29,009
哦，给我一盒44口径的子弹
Uh, gimme a box of .44 skins

449
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:32,164
还有一瓶奎宁水
and a bottle of that tonic water.

450
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,442
我有点头疼
I got me a headache.

451
00:45:43,520 --> 00:45:45,488
啊
Ahh.

452
00:45:45,720 --> 00:45:47,722
你完事了吗？
You done?

453
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,771
我看起来完事了吗？
I look like I'm done?

454
00:45:55,720 --> 00:45:57,643
看你让我做了什么
Look what you made me do.

455
00:45:57,720 --> 00:45:59,210
哦，我来清理一下
Oh I'll just, uh, clean that up.

456
00:45:59,360 --> 00:46:01,681
不，不，不用
No, no, it's all right.

457
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:04,730
约翰 亨利来擦
John Henry'll get it.

458
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:08,606
是不是，约翰 亨利？
Won't you, John Henry?

459
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,609
是啊，弄干净啊
Yeah, get it all.

460
00:46:18,720 --> 00:46:20,688
别漏掉了那边
Don't miss that spot over there.

461
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:25,090
哦，我的靴子上也有
Oh, and you got some on my boot.

462
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:47,880
你知道，我不在乎你看我的眼神
You know, I don't care for the way you're looking at me.

463
00:46:58,760 --> 00:47:01,809
你知道你的问题所在吗，约翰 亨利？
You know what your problem is, John Henry?

464
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,120
你想成为一个圣徒
You wanna act like a pilgrim,

465
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,923
但是你始终还是一个杀手的态度
but you still got the attitude of a killer.

466
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,129
我一会儿回来，彼得斯先生
I'll come back later, Mr. Parsons.

467
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:22,963
你想去哪儿？
Where do ya think you're going?

468
00:47:23,080 --> 00:47:24,969
让开
Get out of my way.

469
00:47:25,080 --> 00:47:27,765
哦。你看？ 又来粗鲁的了
Oh, ya see? There ya go, being rude again.

470
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:30,286
不
No!

471
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,811
笨蛋了吧，枪手？
Not so smart, are you now, gunslinger?

472
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:49,842
不
No!

473
00:47:56,080 --> 00:47:57,969
大家来帮帮忙啊
Somebody help us.

474
00:47:58,080 --> 00:48:00,686
嘿，算了，我们只是娱乐一下
Hey, hey, come on now. We're just funnin'.

475
00:48:14,440 --> 00:48:16,841
快点，内德，接着揍他
Come on, Ned, hit him again.

476
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,326
快点，约翰 亨利，站起来
Come on, John Henry, get up.

477
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:29,526
约翰 亨利，别起来
John Henry, stay down.

478
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,281
帮帮忙吧！求你们了！
Somebody help! Please!

479
00:49:03,400 --> 00:49:05,562
是约翰 亨利
It's John Henry.

480
00:49:05,680 --> 00:49:06,761
你要干嘛？
Where you going?

481
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:07,967
他需要帮助
He needs help.

482
00:49:08,080 --> 00:49:09,570
有人会帮助他的
Well, others will help him.

483
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,047
他是我的朋友
He's my friend.

484
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,369
我说给我回来，臭女人！
I said get back here, woman!

485
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,887
欢迎，先生们
Welcome, gentleman.

486
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:15,964
为什么不给先生们来点喝的呢？
Why don't you get the gentlemen some drinks?

487
00:50:29,400 --> 00:50:33,200
你来我这里喝酒说明你一定很渴啊
You must be really thirsty to be drinking in my place.

488
00:50:33,320 --> 00:50:35,926
别烦我
Let me be.

489
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:40,447
我听说了街上发生的事情
I heard about what happened on the street.

490
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,531
现在的女人越来越勇敢了，不是吗？
Seems women get bolder every year, don't they?

491
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:47,999
我有个建议
I believe I have a proposal

492
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,765
对我们两个都有好处
which might be of benefit to both of us.

493
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:53,008
我不想干涉别人的
Now the last thing I want is to interfere

494
00:50:53,009 --> 00:50:55,810
婚姻问题
in a man's marital affairs,

495
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,527
但是，看起来你的住地改变一下
but it appears that a change in locale for you

496
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:03,201
对我们都有好处
might be a solution for both of us.

497
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,050
当鸡窝来了狐狸
When you got a fox in the henhouse,

498
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:12,970
只有两个选择
only two things to do:

499
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,728
杀死狐狸或者把鸡窝搬走
Kill the fox or move the henhouse.

500
00:51:17,840 --> 00:51:23,529
把土地卖了，拿上钱，搬走
Sell the land, take the money, move away.

501
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:29,050
远离这里还有约翰 亨利 克莱顿
Far, far from here and John Henry Clayton.

502
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,802
成交
Done.

503
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:56,162
天啊
Oh my.

504
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,208
你感觉怎样？
How are you feeling?

505
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:03,767
我希望别再说这些了
I wish people would stop asking me that.

506
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:08,084
只是出于朋友间的关心
It's only natural for friends to inquire.

507
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,851
我们就是这样的关系了，戴夫？
Is that what we are, Dave?

508
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:14,122
朋友？
Friends?

509
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:17,084
我希望如此
I'd like to think so.

510
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:21,079
那你回答我，你觉得像我们这样的人
Then answer me this...Do you think there's a place

511
00:52:21,080 --> 00:52:25,847
还有地方可去吗，远离杀戮之地？
for men like us to go, get away from the killing?

512
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:29,248
以我的经验，我会说没有
My experience would lead me to say no.

513
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:37,802
战后，我发誓不再去碰枪
After the war I swore to myself I'd never pick up a gun again.

514
00:52:37,920 --> 00:52:39,331
经历过那样的事
You can't go through something like that

515
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:42,119
你不可能再和以前一样
and expect to be who you were.

516
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:44,122
我想是的
I suppose.

517
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:47,926
我可以问问，你最糟糕的经历是什么吗？
May I ask, what was the worst of it for ya?

518
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:52,563
毫无疑问，夏伊洛之战
Without a doubt, Shiloh.

519
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,843
我赞同
I would concur.

520
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,965
在奥多 克里克的第一天，我就失去了很多的朋友
That first day at Owl Creek I lost a lot of good friends.

521
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:03,050
我也在奥多 克里克
I was there at Owl Creek.

522
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:07,045
我不记得你在那里啊
I do not recall seeing you there.

523
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:11,802
我在克里克的另一边
I was on the other side of the creek.

524
00:53:11,920 --> 00:53:14,651
这样啊
Well.

525
00:53:15,920 --> 00:53:18,161
看起来历史
It would appear the past

526
00:53:18,280 --> 00:53:21,329
要重演啊
is close to repeating itself with us.

527
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:26,159
我感觉你和我要面对不可避免的结局
I feel you and I are headed for an inevitable conclusion.

528
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,159
我不想和你作对，戴夫
I got no fight with you, Dave.

529
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:33,848
除非我找麻烦，你知道的
Besides, if I was looking for trouble, you'd already know it.

530
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,088
会怎样？
How so?

531
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,159
因为要是以前，我会进城
'Cause I'd have gone into town

532
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:41,323
而且已经把弗兰克和那个家伙杀掉了
and I'd have killed Frank and that big fella.

533
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,083
我很钦佩你的克制力，约翰 亨利
I do admire your restraint, John Henry. I do.

534
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,806
上帝都知道我不会像你这样
God knows I could not turn the other cheek

535
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:51,843
被动挨打的
the way that you have.

536
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:55,203
但是，我也知道如果不停的踢一条狗
But I also know if you kick a dog long enough,

537
00:53:55,320 --> 00:53:57,527
它也是会咬人的
he's gonna bite.

538
00:53:58,760 --> 00:54:02,199
所有我不知道你哪里来的
So whatever it is that's given you the strength

539
00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:06,842
置身事外的力量，我希望你能保持住
to stay out of this, I pray you hold on to it.

540
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:11,487
我不想在另一边看见你
I don't wanna see you on the other side of that creek.

541
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,650
上帝是我的光明
The Lord is my light

542
00:55:21,760 --> 00:55:23,410
和我的救星
and my salvation.

543
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:25,409
我还怕谁呢？
Whom should I fear?

544
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:28,279
上帝是我心中的力量
The Lord is the strength of my life.

545
00:55:28,280 --> 00:55:31,204
我还怕谁呢？
Of whom shall I be afraid?

546
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:35,649
教教我，上帝
Teach me thy way, Oh Lord.

547
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,163
带领我走平坦之路因为我的仇敌
Lead me in a smooth path because of my enemies.

548
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:45,241
不要把我交给我的仇敌
Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries.

549
00:55:45,360 --> 00:55:50,048
要抛弃暴力
And such as breathe out violence.

550
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:11,042
如果没有信念我可能早就失去了信心
I would have lost heart if I had not believed

551
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:15,006
我会看到上帝的恩赐
that I would see the goodness of the Lord

552
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,761
出现在我们的生存之地
in the land of the living.

553
00:56:18,880 --> 00:56:21,770
等待上帝吧
Wait for the Lord.

554
00:56:21,880 --> 00:56:27,250
要有勇气，他会坚固你的内心
Be of good courage and he shall strengthen your heart.

555
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:31,410
我说等待上帝
Wait, I say, on the Lord.

556
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,488
阿门
Amen.

557
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:42,761
- 你好啊  - 嘿
- Hey there.- Hey

558
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:45,605
很高兴你找到了你的出路
It's good to see you finding your way back.

559
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:47,609
谢谢
Thank you.

560
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:49,768
我们要走了！
We're leaving now!

561
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,962
你离他远点
You stay away from her.

562
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,843
你说什么，汤姆？
What are you saying, Tom?

563
00:56:54,960 --> 00:56:57,361
你以为我不知道吗？
You don't think I see what's going on?

564
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,569
怎么了？
What's going on?

565
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,569
汤姆
Tom.

566
00:57:02,680 --> 00:57:04,569
不要插手，牧师
Stay out of this, Reverend.

567
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:07,968
看看我们大家，嗯？
Look at all of us, huh?

568
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:10,765
他多年后回到这里
He comes back here after all these years

569
00:57:10,880 --> 00:57:15,204
我们热情微笑的欢迎他
and we welcome him home with smiles and open arms.

570
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,368
为什么？
Why? Huh?

571
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:20,284
我告诉你们为什么
I'll tell you why.

572
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,880
因为我们都害怕他
'Cause we're all afraid of him

573
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:26,681
害怕他做过的事情和准备要做的事情
and the things he's done and things he might do.

574
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,402
你觉得你这么多年后回来
You think you can walk back in here after all these years

575
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:35,007
还能继续以前的生活吗？
and just pick up where you left off?

576
00:57:35,120 --> 00:57:37,327
我很理解你说的，汤姆
I understand what you're thinking Tom,

577
00:57:37,400 --> 00:57:39,129
但是你错了
but you're wrong.

578
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:41,766
那么告诉我，你不再爱她了
Then tell me you don't love her.

579
00:57:41,880 --> 00:57:43,769
说啊
<i>Go on.</i>

580
00:57:43,880 --> 00:57:47,407
我希望你能在上帝，你父亲
I want you to tell me in front of God, your father,

581
00:57:47,480 --> 00:57:50,450
还有所有人面前说，你不再爱她了
and everyone here that you don't love her.

582
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:53,040
快说！
Say it!

583
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:57,691
告诉我，你不再爱她了！
Tell me you don't love her!

584
00:58:26,640 --> 00:58:29,246
你错怪他了，汤姆
You're wrong about him, Tom.

585
00:58:45,840 --> 00:58:48,286
麦柯迪先生，我要和你谈谈
Mr. McCurdy, I need to talk to you.

586
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:52,564
下周二我会准备好合约给你签字
The papers will be ready for you to sign Tuesday.

587
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:56,048
不，我决定不卖给你了
No, I've decided not to sell to you.

588
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:58,731
很好笑吗？
Something funny?

589
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:02,401
我总觉得好笑，我的耳朵总是欺骗我
I'm amused at how many times my ears play tricks on me.

590
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,403
我刚才还在想，我听见你说
For a moment I thought I heard you say you wish

591
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,721
有了我们的合约你可以摆脱困境了
to extricate yourself from the agreement we made.

592
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,241
当然，我知道你不会这样说的
Of course, I know you couldn't've said that.

593
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:10,360
我是这样说的
I did say that.

594
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:11,526
我在考虑我的...
See, I been thinking my...

595
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:17,721
闭嘴！
Shut up!

596
00:59:17,840 --> 00:59:20,081
我希望你考虑所有的
Before you open your yap again, I want you to consider

597
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:23,767
后果之后，你再开口
the full ramifications of your fucking actions.

598
00:59:23,880 --> 00:59:26,519
我们约定好了
We had a deal.

599
00:59:26,520 --> 00:59:28,519
我什么也没签
I didn't sign nothing.

600
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:30,522
话也说了， 手也握了
Words were spoke. Hands were shook.

601
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,682
我改变主意了
Well, I've had a change of heart.

602
00:59:32,800 --> 00:59:35,690
我知道，如果还有感情在
Come to realize that a new start don't mean much

603
00:59:35,840 --> 00:59:37,888
去了别的地方也没用
if you carrying old feelings with you.

604
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:40,048
哦，汤姆，你说话很深奥啊
Oh well, that's very fucking deep, Tom.

605
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,128
像作诗似的
Almost poetic.

606
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:46,559
在我擦干眼泪前，我要说
And as I wipe a weepy tear from my eye let me say this:

607
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:48,688
我虽然不是什么很高尚的人，但是我要是
I'm not one who holds high principles, but when a man

608
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,283
和某个人握了手，而且说了他要做的事情
shakes my hand and says he's gonna do something,

609
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,046
我希望他能照做
I expect him to follow through.

610
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,767
你下周二之前来这里
Now you be here before the end of business Tuesday

611
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,291
签了合约
and sign those papers.

612
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,563
和这个镇子告别吧
And bid this town a fond farewell

613
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:08,765
否则后果很严重
or suffer the fucking consequences.

614
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:53,520
我不是要坐在这里假装
Well, I ain't gonna just sit here pretending

615
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:57,321
你和我互相对视...
that you and I have ever seen eye to eye on, well...

616
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,488
发生太多事情了
pretty much anything.

617
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:03,606
我来是为了乞求原谅的
Reason I ain't coming here begging for forgiveness

618
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:06,491
因为我觉得我可能得不到宽恕
is because I don't think I deserve it.

619
01:01:06,640 --> 01:01:09,325
但是，我能看清我的目的
But I would be mighty grateful if you could make my purpose

620
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:12,410
还是很感激你的
a little more clear to me.

621
01:01:40,080 --> 01:01:45,166
在我回家之前，我四处漂泊
Before I came home, I was just drifting.

622
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:47,851
从一个镇子到另一个镇子
Town to town.

623
01:01:47,960 --> 01:01:50,361
最后到了堪萨斯州的一个叫
Ended up in a small place called Norton,

624
01:01:50,480 --> 01:01:53,131
诺顿的小地方
way over in Kansas.

625
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:57,685
走了很久的路，进了一个酒吧喝酒
Been riding hard, went in the saloon for a drink.

626
01:01:57,800 --> 01:01:59,689
两个人来找茬
Two men come up on me looking for a fight,

627
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:03,168
我就和他们打起来了
so I gave it to 'em.

628
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:07,241
杀死了一个，又伤了另一个
Cut one of 'em up pretty bad, outdrew on the other.

629
01:02:07,360 --> 01:02:10,682
告诉他，带上他的伙伴快滚
Told him to pick up his partner and get.

630
01:02:13,840 --> 01:02:17,561
我所需要做的就是离开
All I had to do was leave that town.

631
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:21,126
但是我没有
But I didn't.

632
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:23,448
我等着
I waited.

633
01:02:23,800 --> 01:02:27,719
希望他们能回来
Daring 'em to come after me.

634
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:32,328
我太自信了，当我走到外面
And sure enough, when I walked outside

635
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,286
有两个年轻人朝我开枪
those two young men started firing on me.

636
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:40,604
打中了我的马，我拔枪还击
Shot out my horse. I drew my pistol. I fired back.

637
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:44,770
我干掉了他们两个
I killed them. I killed them both.

638
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:50,685
在枪战中，子弹到处乱飞
In the middle of all of it one of my shots went wide,

639
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:52,967
子弹穿过了一个店铺的玻璃
straight through a storefront window.

640
01:02:55,720 --> 01:02:58,405
一个女人尖叫着跑出来
Woman came out screaming,

641
01:02:58,520 --> 01:03:01,285
满身是血
covered in blood.

642
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,726
起初我以为伤到了她
First I thought I'd shot her.

643
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:10,445
后来他的丈夫出来了...
Then her husband come out...

644
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:16,081
抱着一个小孩儿
carrying a little boy.

645
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:21,765
我杀死了一个孩子，爸爸
I killed a boy, Pop.

646
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:25,286
他看起来和威廉姆一样大
He looked to be the same age as William.

647
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,971
他就躺在那里，是我害了他
He just lay there dead 'cause of what I'd done.

648
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:29,969
就像威廉姆那样
Just like William did.

649
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:31,969
威廉姆的死不是因为你
William didn't die because of you.

650
01:03:32,120 --> 01:03:34,122
你不对威廉姆的死负责
You're not responsible for your brother's death.

651
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,605
你说过不要带他去河边的
You told me not to take him down to the river.

652
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:40,009
我和你们两个都说了，你们还是顽皮的孩子
I told both of you. You were boys doing what boys do.

653
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:43,488
只是个意外，悲剧，但是的确是个事故
It was an accident. Tragic, but an accident.

654
01:03:43,600 --> 01:03:45,602
我时常想起我的弟弟
I often think about what my brother

655
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:47,563
长大了会是什么样子
would've grown up to be.

656
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:48,886
现在我又在想那个在诺顿的孩子
Now I can't stop thinking about what that little boy

657
01:03:49,000 --> 01:03:52,447
长大了又是什么样子
from Norton would've grown up to be.

658
01:03:53,000 --> 01:03:55,890
我确定的唯一一件事就是
The only thing I know that's true in my heart

659
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:59,129
如果这两个孩子长大了
is that both of those boys would've grown up to be

660
01:03:59,240 --> 01:04:01,208
一定比我强多了
a far cry better than me.

661
01:04:02,680 --> 01:04:06,002
爸爸，我非常抱歉我变成这样
Pa, I'm so sorry for what I've become.

662
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:26,882
查理，查理
Charlie, Charlie.

663
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,011
快点，进屋去
Go on, stay inside.

664
01:04:30,120 --> 01:04:32,851
我可以和你谈谈吗，夫人？
Might I have a word with you, ma'am?

665
01:04:32,920 --> 01:04:36,163
据我所知，我们之间没什么交易，麦柯迪先生
We have no business that I know of, Mr. McCurdy.

666
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,328
你知道的
That you know of.

667
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:41,842
你丈夫和我谈到了出售他的农场
Your husband and I have spoken about him selling his farm.

668
01:04:41,843 --> 01:04:43,842
我很惊奇
Well, I'd be surprised

669
01:04:43,920 --> 01:04:45,922
我丈夫会有这样的想法
if my husband entertained such an idea.

670
01:04:46,040 --> 01:04:47,929
夫人，让你感到惊奇了
Well, ma'am, if that surprises you,

671
01:04:48,040 --> 01:04:50,042
你一定很吃惊
you'll be dumbstruck to learn

672
01:04:50,160 --> 01:04:52,686
他已经同意出售农场了
he's agreed to the sale of the property.

673
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:54,768
我不相信你说的
I don't believe you.

674
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,002
这我不关心
Well, that's of little concern to me,

675
01:04:57,160 --> 01:05:00,209
因为他才是产权人
being as he's the title holder.

676
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:03,289
我希望你们离开我的土地
I want you off my land.

677
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:07,928
你有这个权力，还有...
And you have every right to do so for another...

678
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:11,487
32小时18分钟
32 hours and 18 minutes.

679
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:13,762
要是我们不走呢？
And if we're still here?

680
01:05:13,880 --> 01:05:17,089
那我就要为你们准备葬礼穿的服装了
Then I'd start looking for a black dress.

681
01:05:18,040 --> 01:05:20,008
我们走
Let's go.

682
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:32,486
停
Whoa.

683
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:44,801
麦柯迪要侵占我们的土地
McCurdy wants our land.

684
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,451
你应该和你丈夫说
You should be speaking with your husband.

685
01:05:47,560 --> 01:05:49,881
我在和你说话
I'm speaking to you.

686
01:05:49,960 --> 01:05:54,329
汤姆和麦柯迪做了交易，但现在又改变主意了
Tom made a deal with McCurdy and now he's changed his mind.

687
01:05:54,920 --> 01:05:58,481
玛丽 爱丽丝，你需要回家，和你丈夫谈谈
Mary Alice, you need to go home and speak with your husband.

688
01:05:58,640 --> 01:06:00,449
他会送命的
He's gonna get himself killed.

689
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:03,285
我不希望孩子没了父亲
I don't want that for my boy.

690
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:05,846
你知道他为什么这样做吗
You know why he's doing this.

691
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,685
为了证明他比你强
To prove that he's as good as you are.

692
01:06:10,760 --> 01:06:12,922
玛丽 爱丽丝，我已经见识过了
Mary Alice, I've seen this before

693
01:06:12,923 --> 01:06:14,919
而且只有一个结局
and it only ends one way.

694
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:17,048
你想拯救你的家庭？
You wanna save your family?

695
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,931
那就答应麦柯迪的条件，赶快搬走
You take what McCurdy's offering and you move away.

696
01:06:19,932 --> 01:06:22,605
你听懂了吗？你搬走
You understand me? You move away.

697
01:06:33,960 --> 01:06:35,928
抱歉，麦柯迪先生
Excuse me, Mr. McCurdy?

698
01:06:36,000 --> 01:06:38,959
牧师来了，他想和你谈谈
Reverend's here. He wants a word with you.

699
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:41,247
他说什么了吗？
Did he say what it's about?

700
01:06:41,360 --> 01:06:42,247
汤姆 沃森
Tom Watson.

701
01:06:42,360 --> 01:06:45,967
哦， 我就知道，让他进来吧
Oh, I should've known. Show him in.

702
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:55,884
你应该放过沃森一家，詹姆士
You're to leave the Watsons alone, James.

703
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,327
你不要总是嗦了， 塞缪尔
You sure do have a repetitive nature, Samuel.

704
01:06:58,440 --> 01:07:00,329
你决定了
I mean it.

705
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:03,728
决定什么？我不同意你想怎样？
Mean what? What are you gonna do if I don't, hm?

706
01:07:03,840 --> 01:07:07,049
要求上帝用闪电劈死我？
Command the Lord to strike me dead with a lightning bolt?

707
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:11,206
我们曾是朋友
We were friends.

708
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:13,448
我是请求你
I'm asking you,

709
01:07:13,560 --> 01:07:17,007
别再逼汤姆 沃森了
stop doing what you're doing to Tom Watson.

710
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:20,920
汤姆 沃森和我握了手，同意了约定
Tom Watson shook my hand and agreed to a deal.

711
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:22,923
他不打算离开
He's not going to leave.

712
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:24,923
他会的
He Will.

713
01:07:25,000 --> 01:07:28,846
不管怎样，他会的
One way or another, he will.

714
01:08:18,400 --> 01:08:20,482
你干了什么？
You did what?

715
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:22,602
不
No!

716
01:08:22,720 --> 01:08:24,848
你为什么...
What are you...

717
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:29,363
为什么一直摇头？
what are you shaking your head at?

718
01:08:31,680 --> 01:08:34,923
你是个傻瓜，弗兰克
A damn fool, Frank.

719
01:08:35,040 --> 01:08:37,079
你做了一件事
You did the one thing

720
01:08:37,080 --> 01:08:39,890
把约翰 亨利 克莱顿彻底卷进来了
that will bring John Henry Clayton into this.

721
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,127
爸爸
Pa!

722
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,240
在后面
In the back!

723
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:03,289
他怎么样了？
How is he?

724
01:09:03,400 --> 01:09:05,880
我还不确定
I don't know yet.

725
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,968
爸爸
Pa.

726
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:26,968
约翰 亨利
John Henry.

727
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:31,649
他怎么样了？
How is he?

728
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:33,808
刀子没刺中要害器官
Well, the blade missed any vital organs,

729
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:36,526
但是他失血过多
but he did lose a fair amount of blood.

730
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,165
明早才能知道情况
We'll know more in the morning.

731
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:39,280
我想见他
I wanna see him.

732
01:09:39,360 --> 01:09:41,328
他还在昏迷
He's not conscious.

733
01:09:41,440 --> 01:09:44,330
我只是想坐在他旁边
I just wanna sit with him.

734
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:07,850
不要离开我啊，爸爸
Don't you even think of leaving me, old man.

735
01:10:07,960 --> 01:10:09,928
现在不行
Not now.

736
01:10:10,040 --> 01:10:13,169
经历了这么多事情之后
Not after everything we've come through.

737
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,529
我去叫医生
I'll get the doc.

738
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:50,524
不，听我说，孩子
No. Listen to me, son.

739
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:53,365
我要告诉你些事情
I have to tell you something.

740
01:10:55,200 --> 01:10:57,806
我错了
I was wrong.

741
01:10:57,920 --> 01:11:02,847
我看错了你，也看错了我自己
I was wrong about you, and I was wrong about me.

742
01:11:02,960 --> 01:11:06,931
那个家伙，如果有机会我会杀了他的
That big fella, I would've killed him if I could've.

743
01:11:07,040 --> 01:11:09,646
我会杀了他们所有人
I would've killed all of them.

744
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:13,162
你和我
You and me,

745
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:16,881
我们血脉相连
we are the same blood.

746
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:26,162
我很害怕，约翰 亨利
I'm filled with fear, John Henry.

747
01:11:26,240 --> 01:11:28,163
你会好起来的，爸爸
You're gonna be fine, Pop.

748
01:11:28,240 --> 01:11:30,686
不，不是担心我
No, no, not for me.

749
01:11:30,800 --> 01:11:34,885
我是害怕失去你，我能看到你眼神的含义
I'm fearful I'm gonna lose you. I can see what's in your eyes.

750
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,846
那么你知道我打算干什么了
Then you know what I gotta do.

751
01:11:41,960 --> 01:11:45,169
你不必做任何事
You don't have to do anything.

752
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,881
但是我们都知道我要做什么
But we both know I will.

753
01:11:51,720 --> 01:11:53,609
我去叫医生
I'll get the doc.

754
01:11:53,720 --> 01:11:57,088
约翰 亨利 克莱顿，等一下
John Henry Clayton, you stop.

755
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,371
约翰 亨利，求你了
John Henry, please.

756
01:12:08,240 --> 01:12:10,242
求你了...
Please...

757
01:12:10,320 --> 01:12:13,210
为了我...
for me...

758
01:12:13,280 --> 01:12:15,203
不要啊
don't.

759
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,965
事情总要有个了结，总要有人去了结
This ain't gonna end, Pa, till someone ends it.

760
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:21,926
不是你，你没必要去
Not you. It doesn't have to be you.

761
01:12:22,040 --> 01:12:25,279
是时候做点事情了
It's time I did something right in my life.

762
01:12:25,280 --> 01:12:29,080
我知道该怎么做
This is what I know how to do.

763
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:28,885
彼得斯先生，这是拉曼手枪吗？
Mr. Parsons, in that a LeMat?

764
01:13:29,360 --> 01:13:31,249
是的，先生
Yes, sir.

765
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:34,364
我一个月前从一个家伙那里买到的
I bought it off a fella about a month ago.

766
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:39,965
是把好枪，对吧？
She's a real beaut, ain't she?

767
01:13:40,080 --> 01:13:43,359
9发子弹，10mm口径短枪
Nine shots in a 10 gauge shotgun barrel.

768
01:13:43,360 --> 01:13:48,400
我还可以给你便宜点
And I can let you have it for a fair price.

769
01:13:48,520 --> 01:13:52,570
或者你可以先借走
Or you can just borrow it.

770
01:15:12,400 --> 01:15:15,404
我猜你就是人称小内德的？
I suspect you're the one they call Little Ned?

771
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,689
没错
That's right.

772
01:15:37,480 --> 01:15:40,529
你们这些家伙不想今天死在这里的
All you young 'uns who ain't willing to die today,

773
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:42,762
放下枪，赶快走人
I suggest you unarmed yourselves and get.

774
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:45,486
谁都不许走
Stay where you are, boys.

775
01:15:55,760 --> 01:15:58,366
该死的
Goddamn you.

776
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:07,409
操！ 啊...
Fuck! Ah!

777
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,405
你口渴了吗，弗兰克？
Mouth getting dry, Frank?

778
01:18:16,520 --> 01:18:19,649
你要给我来杯酒？
You offering to buy me a drink?

779
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:12,728
约翰 亨利
John Henry.

780
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:26,569
接下来不管发生什么，我想让你知道
Whatever happens next, I want you to know

781
01:19:26,680 --> 01:19:30,321
我一直不主张对你父亲用那样的手法
I did not sanction that cowardly act against your father.

782
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,647
就我个人而言，我觉得他们的作为很可耻
Personally, I found their actions damnable

783
01:19:32,720 --> 01:19:35,485
他们应该得到惩罚
and deserving of the fate you brought upon them.

784
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:37,648
那么你要离开？
Then you'll be leaving?

785
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:39,768
我不能那样做
Can't do that.

786
01:19:39,920 --> 01:19:43,719
没有人会雇一个枪手一出事就跑了
No one hires a gunman who runs from trouble.

787
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:47,770
你不必跑，戴夫，你可以走
You don't have to run, Dave. You can walk.

788
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,765
雇佣我的协议不允许我这样做
The terms of my employment would not allow me to do that.

789
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,765
这把拉曼手枪有点沉，对我很不利啊
This here LeMat's mighty heavy. Puts me at a disadvantage.

790
01:20:19,800 --> 01:20:21,723
那你有什么建议？
What would you suggest?

791
01:20:21,800 --> 01:20:25,202
你可以让我回去
Would you be kind enough to let me go back inside

792
01:20:25,320 --> 01:20:27,402
取回我的柯特手枪吗？
and retrieve myself a Colt?

793
01:20:39,520 --> 01:20:41,807
谢谢
Thank you.

794
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:20,204
我的朋友，你不再是一个雇员了
My friend, you are no longer employed.

795
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:33,651
看来你是对的
It would appear you are correct.

796
01:22:43,120 --> 01:22:46,010
很高兴认识你，戴夫
It's been a pleasure knowing you, Dave.

797
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:24,962
我没事，爸爸
I'm all right, Pa.

798
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,891
今天发生的事情
It's not gonna take long

799
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,325
很快就会传出去
for word to get out on what happened here today.

800
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:31,801
很多人会来找我
Men from far and wide are

801
01:23:31,920 --> 01:23:33,160
想来杀掉我出名
gonna come looking for me to make a name for themselves.

802
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:37,769
别走啊，我自己清理不完那块地
Don't go away. I can't finish the field on my own.

803
01:23:37,880 --> 01:23:40,690
那块地清理好了，爸爸，我还播了种子
The field's finished, Pa. I seeded it

804
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,531
它会自己长出来的
It'll take care of itself.

805
01:23:43,640 --> 01:23:45,959
我要走了
<i>I</i> gotta go.

806
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,804
你不会一走又是十年吧？
You're not going for another 10 years, are you?

807
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:51,440
不会的，我保证
No, I promise.

808
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:53,688
很快回来，爸爸
See you soon, Pa.

809
01:24:14,640 --> 01:24:15,846
在那之后就很少有人
<i>Little is known</i>

810
01:24:15,960 --> 01:24:17,007
知道他的行踪了
<i>of him after that.</i>

811
01:24:17,120 --> 01:24:19,441
有人说他去了咖啡镇
<i>Some say he drifted down to Coffeeville</i>

812
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:22,723
几年后，他又卷入了
<i>where he was involved in another altercation</i>

813
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:24,999
另一场争端
<i>a few years later.</i>

814
01:24:25,000 --> 01:24:28,322
但是这些说法都未经证实
<i>But those accusations were never proven.</i>

815
01:24:28,440 --> 01:24:31,330
通常的说法是，他搬去了西部
<i>The common view was he moved westward</i>

816
01:24:31,440 --> 01:24:33,329
换了名字
<i>under a different name,</i>

817
01:24:33,440 --> 01:24:37,331
去了一个与世隔绝的地方
<i>where he lived</i> a <i>life of quiet isolation.</i>

818
01:24:41,440 --> 01:24:44,330
我知道的是，几年后玛丽 爱丽丝死了
<i>What is known is that when Mary Alice died</i>

819
01:24:44,440 --> 01:24:48,286
他也没来参加葬礼
a <i>few years later, he did not attend her funeral.</i>

820
01:24:48,400 --> 01:24:52,086
不管怎样，很多人说玛丽 爱丽丝死后的第二天
<i>However, many say the following day,</i>

821
01:24:52,200 --> 01:24:57,127
她的墓碑上多了一条褪了色的红丝带
<i>a faded red ribbon was found attached to her headstone.</i>

822
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:07,965
福勒镇上一些人讲述着这些年
<i>Others in Fowler recounted stories of seeing him</i>

823
01:25:08,080 --> 01:25:12,210
见到过他几次，直到他父亲去世
<i>throughout the years up until his father's death,</i>

824
01:25:12,320 --> 01:25:16,086
之后他就再也没有回来过了
<i>at which time he came no more.</i>
