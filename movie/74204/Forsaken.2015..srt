1
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:54,612
你媽過世了
Your mother is dead.

2
00:05:53,184 --> 00:05:55,887
我不知道她已經走了
I did not know that she had passed.

3
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,292
怎麼會
How could you?

4
00:06:07,797 --> 00:06:09,718
如果我之前知道她病了的話 我一定會
If I had known that she had been sick, I'd...

5
00:06:09,818 --> 00:06:12,054
你一定會什麼
You would've done what?

6
00:06:12,904 --> 00:06:15,906
如果知道她快死了 你一定會回家
You would've come home if you knew she was dying?

7
00:06:16,006 --> 00:06:20,479
但她還活著的時候 還充滿希望的時候 你就不能回家看看嗎
But you couldn't come home when she was living, when she was full of hope?

8
00:06:32,124 --> 00:06:34,226
她怎麼走的
How did she pass?

9
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:41,400
在我懷裏
In my arms,

10
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,604
躺在我旁邊
lying beside me in bed.

11
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,340
一邊哭
Weeping.

12
00:06:48,773 --> 00:06:51,376
一邊叫著你的名字
Calling out your name.

13
00:06:55,413 --> 00:06:58,821
你打算待一段時間嗎
Is it your plan to stay a while?

14
00:07:00,185 --> 00:07:02,455
還不確定
Not sure yet.

15
00:07:05,123 --> 00:07:07,692
你沒配槍
You don't wear guns.

16
00:07:08,426 --> 00:07:11,535
把它們收起來了 我不幹了
I put them away. I'm done with that.

17
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,470
你這是什麼意思
What is that supposed to mean?

18
00:07:19,837 --> 00:07:24,410
我不知道一個人是不是能逃避真正的自己
It means I don't know if a man can get away from who he is.

19
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:27,679
你真以為你瞭解我嗎
And you think you know who I am?

20
00:07:28,079 --> 00:07:30,249
曾經以為
I thought I did.

21
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:08,312
我過會兒回來 要進城一趟
I'll be back. I have to go into town.

22
00:09:08,412 --> 00:09:10,648
我跟你一起去
I'll go with ya.

23
00:10:03,734 --> 00:10:05,836
早上好 教士
Morning, Reverend.

24
00:10:05,936 --> 00:10:09,340
馬上為您效勞 先生 等我忙
And I'll be right with you, sir,just as soon as I...

25
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:14,211
- 天啊 約翰·亨利 是你嗎  - 你好 帕森斯先生
- Lord sakes! John Henry, is that you?  - Hello, Mr. Parsons.

26
00:10:14,311 --> 00:10:19,493
萬能的主 約翰·亨利 打你參戰以後 我就再也沒見過你
Lord almighty, John Henry. I ain't seen you since you went off to war.

27
00:10:20,293 --> 00:10:23,322
我在酒館訂了點夏延（美國地名）的蘋果酒
I asked the saloon to order some sipping cider from Cheyenne for me.

28
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:26,258
你能不能去看看到了嗎
Would you see if it's arrived please?

29
00:10:26,358 --> 00:10:28,759
再見
Mr. Parsons.

30
00:10:29,326 --> 00:10:32,664
你一定很高興他回來了
Must do your heart good to see the boy again.

31
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,334
我列了張單子
I have a list.

32
00:10:46,277 --> 00:10:48,347
克萊頓教士讓我來拿他的蘋果酒
Reverend Clayton sent me to pick up his cider.

33
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:52,251
- 你是  - 他兒子 約翰·亨利
- And who are you?  - His son, John Henry.

34
00:10:59,791 --> 00:11:02,776
嘖 嘖 嘖
Well, well, well.

35
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:07,927
這不是約翰·亨利·克萊頓嘛
If it ain't John Henry Clayton.

36
00:11:08,599 --> 00:11:11,736
我聽說過你的很多事兒
I heard a lot about you.

37
00:11:12,336 --> 00:11:14,840
我是弗蘭克·迪爾曼
Name's Frank Tillman.

38
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:17,556
沒準兒你聽說過我
Maybe you heard of me?

39
00:11:17,656 --> 00:11:19,693
沒有
Can't say as I have.

40
00:11:20,812 --> 00:11:25,016
好吧 我殺過四個人
Well, I killed four men.

41
00:11:26,316 --> 00:11:28,967
還是沒印象
Still don't ring a bell.

42
00:11:34,925 --> 00:11:37,661
你怎麼能不帶槍
How come you ain't wearing a gun?

43
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:39,713
你離開之後
You go and...

44
00:11:39,813 --> 00:11:42,849
是信教了還是怎麼的
get religion or something?

45
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,168
飯桶
Git!

46
00:11:44,268 --> 00:11:46,237
別再打擾我們的客人
Stop pestering our guests.

47
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:48,636
快走
Git.

48
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:02,921
我叫戴夫·特納
My name is Dave Turner.

49
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:05,723
一些人叫我 紳士戴夫
Some call me Gentleman Dave.

50
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:09,467
噢 我聽說過你
Yeah... I heard of you.

51
00:12:12,864 --> 00:12:15,800
請原諒我的夥伴
You're gonna have to forgive my compatriots.

52
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:18,503
他們總是很無聊
Boredom often gets the best of 'em.

53
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:21,294
幾年前 在科德維爾郡
I had the good fortune

54
00:12:21,394 --> 00:12:26,210
我有幸看到過你
of watching you rid this world of Big Jim Westfield

55
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,414
為大家除掉大吉姆·維斯特菲爾德
down in Coldwell County a few years back.

56
00:12:30,514 --> 00:12:33,021
印象深刻
Most impressive.

57
00:12:34,018 --> 00:12:38,056
我能不能問下 你為什麼來福勒
May I ask what brings you to Fowler?

58
00:12:42,961 --> 00:12:47,032
我只是想定位下咱們的關係
I'm only trying to ascertain the nature of our relationship.

59
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:50,241
我不希望有什麼麻煩
I'm hoping there won't be any trouble.

60
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:56,374
放心
Not from me.

61
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:06,234
我都不記得這兒有這麼繁榮了
I don't recall things being so prosperous.

62
00:13:06,584 --> 00:13:10,389
對於某些人來說是很繁榮 要修鐵路了
Prosperous to some. Railroad's coming.

63
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,495
馬車可不會自己裝貨
Buggy's not gonna load itself.

64
00:13:18,028 --> 00:13:20,397
拿著
Take these.

65
00:13:20,497 --> 00:13:23,233
給你 不許一次全花光
Take this. Don't you spend it all at once.

66
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,536
麥科迪先生
Mr. McCurdy,

67
00:13:25,636 --> 00:13:29,469
猜猜五分鐘前誰在這兒
guess who was just in here not five minutes ago?

68
00:13:30,269 --> 00:13:32,676
約翰·亨利·克萊頓
John Henry Clayton.

69
00:13:35,146 --> 00:13:39,383
- 他會是個麻煩嗎  - 他對我態度還好
- Is he gonna be a problem?  - He didn't look too tough to me.

70
00:13:39,783 --> 00:13:42,386
我問的不是對你
I'm not asking you.

71
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:48,226
他會是個麻煩嗎
Is he gonna be a problem?

72
00:13:49,522 --> 00:13:51,628
他沒帶武器
He was not wearing a sidearm.

73
00:13:51,728 --> 00:13:54,866
可這不代表他不能帶
That doesn't mean he can't put one on.

74
00:13:54,966 --> 00:13:58,202
如果他把他爸那邊的扯進來
If he takes his pa's side in this...

75
00:13:58,302 --> 00:14:00,739
那就成麻煩了
it could be a problem.

76
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:02,906
唔
Well...

77
00:14:03,006 --> 00:14:07,579
不如你讓我來處理這一切
why don't you just leave all that to me?

78
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:16,965
他們在這兒幹什麼
What are they doing here?

79
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,745
你不知道
You don't know?

80
00:14:19,845 --> 00:14:21,940
我怎麼會知道
How would I?

81
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:25,898
我覺得你來這兒跟他們有關係
I thought maybe your coming here might have something to do with them.

82
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:30,402
沒有
Well, it don't.

83
00:14:32,403 --> 00:14:34,405
他們給麥科迪辦事兒
They work for McCurdy.

84
00:14:34,905 --> 00:14:38,742
他正打算買下附近所有的農場
He got his mind set on buying every farm around here.

85
00:14:38,842 --> 00:14:41,454
那些不想賣的人
Folks who don't wanna sell...

86
00:14:41,554 --> 00:14:45,582
就會被那邊兒的哥幾個好好勸一下
they got some persuading from those fellas over there.

87
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:49,419
你要是不認識他們 就最好離他們遠點兒
If you don't know 'em,you better stay away from them.

88
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,588
他們都該下地獄
Those are damned men.

89
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:54,292
都是些邪惡的人
Those are godless men.

90
00:16:11,134 --> 00:16:14,529
你明天打算去教堂嗎
Is it your plan to come to church tomorrow?

91
00:16:14,629 --> 00:16:16,974
是在邀請我嗎 爸
Is that an invitation, Pa?

92
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:19,277
回來
Come back here!

93
00:16:30,771 --> 00:16:33,358
你為什麼回家
What is the reason you came home?

94
00:16:34,391 --> 00:16:36,835
爸 回家還必須得有理由嗎
I didn't know I had to have a reason, Pa.

95
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:40,326
- 要是你想讓我走 那我就走  - 我直說了
- If you want me to go, I'll go.  - I'm a forthright man.

96
00:16:40,426 --> 00:16:42,599
你讓我很難堪
You're an embarrassment to me.

97
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:46,236
今天在那兒 我感受到的都是恥辱
Today in there, all I felt was shame.

98
00:16:46,336 --> 00:16:51,378
但是如果你回來 向上帝承諾 你真的會改變
But if you come back committed to God to truly change your ways...

99
00:16:51,478 --> 00:16:54,788
這就是上帝的意旨讓我原諒你 那我就會原諒你
then it's God's edict that I forgive you and I do.

100
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:59,002
但是以你母親的名義我必須說 我沒辦法忘記過去的十年
But in your mother's name I cannot forget the past 10 years.

101
00:16:59,816 --> 00:17:01,986
我做不到
I cannot.

102
00:17:04,254 --> 00:17:06,325
我知道
I know.

103
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:48,189
你在幹什麼
What in the world are you doing?

104
00:17:50,066 --> 00:17:52,429
媽總想著讓咱倆把這地方清理一下
Ma always wanted us to clear this field together.

105
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:55,310
你和我 不 她沒這麼想過
You and me? No, she didn't.

106
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:57,892
這是我所能想起來的 她唯一要求過咱倆的事情
As far as I can recall it's the only thing she ever asked of us.

107
00:17:58,192 --> 00:18:00,094
跟我沒關係
Not me.

108
00:18:01,244 --> 00:18:03,481
好吧 我自己來
Fine. I'll do it alone.

109
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:05,466
好的
All right.

110
00:18:13,823 --> 00:18:16,361
（讚美詩27）我若不信
I would have lost heart...

111
00:18:16,461 --> 00:18:19,739
我將得見耶和華的恩惠
if I had not believed that I would see...

112
00:18:19,839 --> 00:18:22,566
就早已喪膽
the goodness of the Lord's light.

113
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:25,053
你當壯膽
Be of good courage

114
00:18:25,153 --> 00:18:27,905
他就會給你力量
and he shall give you strength.

115
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:36,279
請原諒
Excuse me.

116
00:18:40,384 --> 00:18:42,250
先生們
Gentleman.

117
00:18:45,088 --> 00:18:48,767
我們覺得咱們應該帶著咱們的槍
We think we should bring in our own hired guns.

118
00:18:49,326 --> 00:18:52,030
帶槍 做什麼
Hired gun. To do what?

119
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:54,853
挑起戰爭 殺掉每個人
Start a war? Kill everyone?

120
00:18:54,953 --> 00:18:56,701
槍可不是解決辦法
Guns are not the answer.

121
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:59,003
自打治安官半夜裏跑掉之後
Eversince Sheriff Hutton ran off in the middle of night,

122
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:01,172
麥科迪那夥人就越來越囂張
McCurdy and his boys been getting bolder.

123
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:04,540
上禮拜逼走了蒂姆·福勒 現在他們又在威脅皮特森
Forced Tim Fuller off his land last week.Now they're threatening Peterson.

124
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:08,330
他們要是來我這兒 就見識見識我10號口徑的槍吧
They come on my land, they'll be looking to the wrong end of my 10 gauge.

125
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,848
等下 丹尼爾 等等
Wait, Daniel. Wait.

126
00:19:10,948 --> 00:19:15,118
我已經通知了馬歇爾  咱們很快就有法律支持了
I've wired the U.S. Marshall. We will have the law on our side.

127
00:19:15,218 --> 00:19:20,325
咱們是窮人 法律什麼時候關心過咱們這些人
We're poor. When has the law ever cared about folks like us?

128
00:19:23,409 --> 00:19:25,411
不會有人來的
No one's comin'.

129
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:27,381
再見
Reverend.

130
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,156
瑪麗·愛麗絲
Mary Alice.

131
00:19:52,256 --> 00:19:56,926
在教堂聽他們說你回來了 我還不信
Heard people say in church you were back. Didn't believe it.

132
00:19:57,026 --> 00:20:00,197
一定得來自己看看
Needed to come out and see for myself.

133
00:20:01,966 --> 00:20:04,769
我幾天前回來的
I've been back a few days or so.

134
00:20:04,869 --> 00:20:07,539
都幾天了 你居然沒來找我
A few days and you haven't come and seen me?

135
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:12,342
是打算去的 只不過
I planned on it, I just...

136
00:20:14,744 --> 00:20:18,119
你總是不會撒謊
You always were a terrible liar.

137
00:20:25,655 --> 00:20:28,191
我一直等著這天
I waited for this day.

138
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:32,963
一直想 計劃著我該說些什麼
Thought about it.Planned what I might say.

139
00:20:35,449 --> 00:20:37,264
可現在我不知道要說什麼
Now I don't know what to say.

140
00:20:43,639 --> 00:20:46,677
你要自己清理這些嗎
You clearing all this by yourself?

141
00:20:46,777 --> 00:20:48,813
是的 女士
Yes, ma'am.

142
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,517
對於一個人來說 可是不少活兒
Lot of work for one man.

143
00:20:53,617 --> 00:20:56,921
要是你願意幫忙 就幫我鏟土吧
Shovel right over there if you care to help.

144
00:21:03,359 --> 00:21:05,531
你氣色不錯
You look well.

145
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:07,576
你也是
So do you.

146
00:21:07,676 --> 00:21:10,301
我離開那天答應過你 要保持原來的樣子
I swear you look the same as the day I left.

147
00:21:10,401 --> 00:21:12,394
現在你又在撒謊了
Now there you go lying again.

148
00:21:12,494 --> 00:21:16,107
我可不記得你這麼不相信別人 瑪麗·愛麗絲
I don't recall you being so distrustful of folks, Mary Alice.

149
00:21:16,207 --> 00:21:18,375
我從不跟你撒謊
I'd never lie to you.

150
00:21:18,475 --> 00:21:20,180
是嗎 可我似乎記得
Well, I seem to...

151
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:24,982
你說過戰後就會回來
recall you saying something about coming back after the war.

152
00:21:34,023 --> 00:21:36,794
我還是不打擾你幹活兒了
Well, I better let you get back to your work.

153
00:21:39,361 --> 00:21:43,472
等我安定下來之後 或許咱們可以一起騎馬去峭壁那邊兒 像以前一樣
Maybe after I get settled we could ride out to the bluffs like we used to.

154
00:21:44,201 --> 00:21:46,804
這不合適
That wouldn't be right.

155
00:21:48,971 --> 00:21:52,176
- 我結婚了  - 結婚
- I'm married.  - Married?

156
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,610
已經第八年了
Going on eight years now.

157
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:57,747
我有個兒子 叫查理
I have a little boy, Charlie.

158
00:21:58,147 --> 00:21:59,851
我以為你知道
I thought you knew.

159
00:22:00,351 --> 00:22:02,427
不
No.

160
00:22:02,527 --> 00:22:05,170
不 我不知道
No, I did not know that.

161
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:08,257
我等過你
I waited for you.

162
00:22:08,857 --> 00:22:11,127
但是一年年的你音信全無
But when the years passed and there was no word...

163
00:22:11,227 --> 00:22:14,248
瑪麗·愛麗絲 你不需要解釋
Mary Alice, you do not owe me an explanation.

164
00:22:21,938 --> 00:22:24,347
你嫁給誰了
Who did you marry?

165
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,452
湯姆·華生
Tom Watson.

166
00:22:33,717 --> 00:22:36,067
湯姆人很好
Tom's a good man.

167
00:22:36,167 --> 00:22:38,356
是的 的確
Yes, he is.

168
00:22:40,423 --> 00:22:42,892
歡迎回家 約翰·亨利
Welcome home, John Henry.

169
00:22:57,709 --> 00:22:59,845
靠
Shit!

170
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:47,450
好了 把它們領進去 去吧
All right. Bring 'em in, come on.

171
00:23:47,892 --> 00:23:50,297
我靠 丹
What the... Dan!

172
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:54,364
我們正要去找你
We was just coming to pay you a visit.

173
00:23:54,830 --> 00:23:57,068
感謝你幫我們省了這一趟
Appreciate you saving us a ride.

174
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:00,983
我沒話跟你說
I've got nothing to say to you.

175
00:24:01,239 --> 00:24:03,108
唔
Well...

176
00:24:04,108 --> 00:24:06,878
可我有話跟你說
I got something to say to you.

177
00:24:37,608 --> 00:24:39,476
夠了
That's enough.

178
00:24:40,576 --> 00:24:43,530
你不想現在殺了他吧
You don't wanna kill him now, do ya?

179
00:24:43,630 --> 00:24:46,133
嗯 沒準兒我想呢
Well, maybe I do. I...

180
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:48,652
我還沒想好
I hadn't decided yet.

181
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,853
我要送他回家
I'm taking him home.

182
00:24:51,953 --> 00:24:56,127
等等 還輪不到你來決定
Hold on there now.It ain't you who's doing the deciding.

183
00:24:59,161 --> 00:25:01,778
請問我能送他回家嗎
May I take him home?

184
00:25:01,878 --> 00:25:05,682
要是我說不行呢 你打算幹什麼
And what if I say no?What you gonna do about it?

185
00:25:08,838 --> 00:25:12,126
- 什麼也不干  - 抱歉 我沒聽清
- Nothing.  - I'm sorry. I didn't quite hear that.

186
00:25:13,326 --> 00:25:15,412
什麼也不干
Nothing.

187
00:25:19,014 --> 00:25:21,551
好吧 約翰·亨利
All right, John Henry.

188
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:25,590
我允許你送他回家
You have my permission to take him home.

189
00:25:51,314 --> 00:25:53,850
你在困擾什麼
Something's troubling you?

190
00:26:02,759 --> 00:26:05,798
你媽跟我一直不停地問自己
Your mother and I kept asking ourselves...

191
00:26:05,898 --> 00:26:07,748
問上帝
asking God...

192
00:26:07,848 --> 00:26:11,119
把你養大成人的時候 我們到底做錯什麼了
what we done wrong in your upbringing?

193
00:26:12,769 --> 00:26:16,761
我們到底幹了什麼讓你充滿仇恨
What did we do that filled you with so much hate?

194
00:26:17,873 --> 00:26:19,870
跟你們沒關係
It weren't you.

195
00:26:20,943 --> 00:26:24,706
約翰福音 第八章 第三十二節  還記得嗎
John 8:32, remember?

196
00:26:24,806 --> 00:26:28,651
真理必叫你們得以自由    上帝知道真理
The truth will set you free.God knows the truth.

197
00:26:30,851 --> 00:26:33,889
整場戰爭我都不停地問自己 上帝在哪兒
All through the war I kept asking myself, where was God?

198
00:26:33,989 --> 00:26:37,527
在夏洛和七棵松（均為美國南北戰爭戰場）人們相繼死去的時候 他在哪兒
Where was he at Shiloh and Seven Pines when men lay dead and dying?

199
00:26:37,627 --> 00:26:40,929
他們全都是好人 敬畏上帝的人
All good men, God-fearing men.

200
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:46,402
他們就躺在那兒 祈求著上帝最微小的憐憫
They just lay there, begging for some small act of mercy on His behalf.

201
00:26:47,189 --> 00:26:50,507
然後我突然明白了
And then it finally dawned on me:

202
00:26:51,007 --> 00:26:53,411
根本就沒有上帝
There ain't no God.

203
00:26:56,213 --> 00:26:58,623
- 你說沒有上帝  - 我說的是
- There is no God?  - All I'm saying...

204
00:26:58,723 --> 00:27:01,430
每當你需要上帝的時候
is that if there was ever a time that man needed God

205
00:27:01,530 --> 00:27:03,735
相信我 他絕不會出現
it was then and trust me, he wasn't there.

206
00:27:03,835 --> 00:27:06,657
如果你期望上帝來救你 他是不會來的
If you're expecting God to save you, he ain't gonna.

207
00:27:06,757 --> 00:27:11,074
大部分人參加那場戰爭不是為了殺戮
Most men came out of that war wanting nothing more to do with killing,

208
00:27:11,174 --> 00:27:13,632
但你不是  你就是想去殺人
but not you... you went looking for it.

209
00:27:13,918 --> 00:27:16,644
上帝不需要負責你自己選擇的人生
God is not responsible for the life you choose.

210
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:19,157
這不是我選的
I did not choose it!

211
00:27:53,503 --> 00:27:55,605
滾出我的地方
Get off my land.

212
00:27:55,905 --> 00:28:00,343
我們只是來繼續那場被打擾的談話的 丹
We just come to finish the conversation that was interrupted, Dan.

213
00:28:08,150 --> 00:28:11,054
別弄得不愉快
Let us avoid unpleasantness.

214
00:28:11,154 --> 00:28:15,580
先生 我懇求你好好想想
Sir, I implore you to see reason.

215
00:28:16,092 --> 00:28:19,985
如果你稍稍考慮一下你的處境
If you take a fair grasp of your situation,

216
00:28:20,085 --> 00:28:23,645
你就會得出對你來說唯一可能並且合理的結論
you will arrive at the only reasonable conclusion available to you.

217
00:28:23,745 --> 00:28:25,835
我不走
I'm stayin'.

218
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,849
泥土和石頭
Dirt and rock.

219
00:28:41,649 --> 00:28:45,888
和你到處都能看到的那些一樣
Exactly like the dirt and the rocks you would find anywhere.

220
00:28:45,988 --> 00:28:50,029
是 但這是我的土和石頭
Yeah, but it's my dirt and my rock!

221
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:53,495
是的 還是塊不錯的石頭
Yes, and a fine rock it is too.

222
00:28:53,595 --> 00:28:55,932
可它值得你去死嗎
Is it worth dying over?

223
00:28:56,232 --> 00:29:00,463
你確定你老婆更願意要土石而不是你嗎
You believe your wife would prefer the dirt and the rock to you?

224
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:05,196
這些東西能在夜裏給她溫暖 或是
Will this keep her warm at night or...

225
00:29:05,296 --> 00:29:07,870
養家餬口嗎
put the food on the table?

226
00:29:08,783 --> 00:29:11,215
它能教會你的孩子明辨是非嗎
Is it gonna teach your children right from wrong?

227
00:29:12,715 --> 00:29:16,708
這些土石能在他們被風驚醒之後 坐在床邊安撫他們嗎
Comfort them in their beds when they're frightened by the wind?

228
00:29:17,484 --> 00:29:20,526
你瞧 我明白的
You see, I do understand. I do understand.

229
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:26,163
先生 我明白你遭受著多少不公 但是
I truly do understand the inequities
of your position, sir, but...

230
00:29:27,431 --> 00:29:30,770
我相信當你權衡所有的可能之後 你就會發現
I believe when you weigh the alternatives, you will see that...

231
00:29:38,907 --> 00:29:41,944
根本沒必要這樣
There was no need for that.

232
00:29:43,244 --> 00:29:44,779
我們正在溝通
We were talking.

233
00:29:44,879 --> 00:29:49,052
看起來談話已經結束了 戴夫
It would appear the conversation's over now, Dave.

234
00:29:49,152 --> 00:29:51,247
他馬上就明白了
He was about to see reason.

235
00:29:51,347 --> 00:29:55,731
戴夫 你是不是從來沒殺過人 還是你都是靠嘴把他們說死
You actually ever kill anybody, Dave, or you just talk 'em to death?

236
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:07,203
還有誰有話要說嗎
Anybody else have something to say?

237
00:30:16,144 --> 00:30:18,636
丹尼爾·皮特森
Daniel Peterson...

238
00:30:18,736 --> 00:30:22,885
已安心地處在我主的懷抱中
is now safely in the embrace of our Lord.

239
00:30:22,985 --> 00:30:26,863
但對於我們來說 在這世間
But for us, here on earth,

240
00:30:26,963 --> 00:30:29,506
一個好人離去了
a good man has been taken.

241
00:30:29,806 --> 00:30:32,865
他是家庭的頂樑柱
A provider for his family...

242
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:36,012
他是我們大家的朋友
a friend to our community...

243
00:30:36,612 --> 00:30:41,569
在絕望中 我們向上帝抗議
and in our despair, we rail against God.

244
00:30:41,969 --> 00:30:44,309
我們的信仰在承受試煉
Our faith is tested,

245
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:47,370
被推向它的底線
pushed to its very limits.

246
00:30:47,876 --> 00:30:51,480
但萬能的主自有他的目的
But Almighty God has a purpose.

247
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,917
儘管在我們看來 這可能毫無意義
And senseless though it may seem to us,

248
00:30:55,017 --> 00:30:59,423
上帝的智慧並非我等凡夫俗子可質疑的
it is not for mere mortal man to question God's wisdom.

249
00:30:59,532 --> 00:31:02,050
我們要堅持
It is for us to persevere...

250
00:31:02,150 --> 00:31:04,851
去做正直的事
in a righteous way.

251
00:31:06,162 --> 00:31:07,522
- 咱們必須做點什麼  - 比如說
- We gotta do something.  - Like what?

252
00:31:07,664 --> 00:31:10,501
- 不知道 咱們總不能坐視不管  - 找位治安官怎麼樣
- I don't know. We can't do nothing.  - What about getting a sheriff?

253
00:31:10,601 --> 00:31:13,438
已經試過了 大部分人可沒那個膽量接這個苦差
We tried that. Most men ain't got the stomach for a fight like this.

254
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:17,208
我們需要一個懂這些麻煩的人 別人還得敬畏他
We need a man who knows trouble,a man who others fear.

255
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:21,712
- 你說他會幫咱們嗎  - 趕緊斷了這個念頭
- You suppose he might come to our aid?  - Put that out of your head right now.

256
00:31:21,812 --> 00:31:24,747
我們可以付他錢 募集一下 我們已經有200刀了
We could pay him.Took a collection. We got $200.

257
00:31:24,847 --> 00:31:27,450
他已經不幹那個了
He's done with that life.

258
00:31:28,953 --> 00:31:31,288
不能相信詹姆斯居然讓事情發展到這個地步
I can't believe James would let it come to this.

259
00:31:31,388 --> 00:31:35,297
他們殺了丹尼爾·皮特森 我從沒想過他們會殺掉我們其中的一個
They killed Daniel Peterson.I never thought they'd kill one of us.

260
00:31:35,397 --> 00:31:39,262
- 事情只會越來越糟糕  - 何出此言
- It's only gonna get worse. - What makes you say that?

261
00:31:39,362 --> 00:31:42,266
因為有了第一個之後 殺人就越來越容易了
'Cause after the first one,it gets easier.

262
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:49,607
來點什麼 他們在做上好的牛排
You want something?They heat up a good steak.

263
00:31:49,707 --> 00:31:51,787
不用 謝了
No, thank you.

264
00:31:53,176 --> 00:31:57,014
皮特森夫人來過 把她城外的農場賣給我了
Mrs. Peterson came in and sold me her farm on the way out of town.

265
00:31:57,114 --> 00:32:00,084
還有另外兩家也想賣掉了
Two other families wanna sell also.

266
00:32:00,184 --> 00:32:04,288
我是說 這雖然看起來是個殘暴的方法
What I'm saying is... it looks like a more aggressive approach

267
00:32:04,388 --> 00:32:07,891
但在這兒 這方法的確有效
is having an effect on the locals.

268
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,795
克萊德殺了那個人
Clyde murdered that man.

269
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:15,399
據我聽說 皮特森當時拿著槍
From what I heard,Peterson was holding a shotgun.

270
00:32:15,899 --> 00:32:19,236
我來這兒不是為了當謀殺犯的
I did not come here to be part of a pack of murderers.

271
00:32:19,436 --> 00:32:22,425
那你他媽覺得是怎麼回事 戴夫
What the fuck did ya think was gonna happen, Dave?

272
00:32:22,725 --> 00:32:24,265
怎麼
What?

273
00:32:24,365 --> 00:32:27,444
你以為我找你來是為了對那些人好言相勸 好讓他們賣我土地嗎
You think I brought you here to sweet-talk folk off their land?

274
00:32:27,544 --> 00:32:29,311
得了吧 戴夫
Come on, Dave, please.

275
00:32:30,412 --> 00:32:35,619
在農場的事情上 我想讓弗蘭克負責
I want Frank to take care of things when it comes to the farms.

276
00:32:35,719 --> 00:32:38,989
他的脾氣適合幹這個
He seems to have to temperament required.

277
00:32:39,892 --> 00:32:43,522
- 那我呢  - 我也希望你留在這兒
- And me?  - I still want you here.

278
00:32:44,122 --> 00:32:49,853
我覺得約翰·亨利·克萊頓再拿起槍是遲早的事兒
I believe it's only a matter of time before John Henry Clayton picks up his guns.

279
00:32:56,138 --> 00:32:59,314
聽著 我們明天要去查德威克農場
Hear we're riding to the Chadwick farm tomorrow.

280
00:33:05,147 --> 00:33:09,965
你怎麼不站在吧檯上 告訴全世界我們的計劃
Why don't you just stand up on the bar and announce our intention to all creation?

281
00:33:10,165 --> 00:33:11,434
對不起
Sorry.

282
00:33:11,534 --> 00:33:15,755
我想我是太激動了
Guess my... enthusiasm got the better of me.

283
00:33:32,743 --> 00:33:34,804
你今天還打算吃飯嗎
You planning to eat today?

284
00:33:35,144 --> 00:33:37,649
- 不餓  - 可是該吃飯了
- Ain't hungry.  - Need to eat.

285
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:39,284
跟你說了 我不餓
Told you, I ain't hungry.

286
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,372
你是想證明些什麼
You're trying to prove something out here.

287
00:33:44,037 --> 00:33:47,392
- 我什麼都不想證明  - 不 你想
- I ain't trying to prove nothing.  - Yes, you are.

288
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:50,927
整天整天地在這兒忙活著
You're working this land day in, day out.

289
00:33:51,427 --> 00:33:54,932
到晚上的時候 累得都動不了了
You're so weary, time night comes,you can barely move.

290
00:33:55,032 --> 00:33:57,134
這可不是因為你愛農活兒
It's not for love of farming.

291
00:33:57,234 --> 00:33:59,436
我知道是為什麼
I know why it is.

292
00:33:59,536 --> 00:34:04,540
你是想用這塊可憐的土地來耗盡你所有的自責和憤怒
You're trying to use this poor earth to sweat out all your guilt and anger.

293
00:34:04,940 --> 00:34:06,714
就是這麼回事兒 對不對
That's what it is, isn't it?

294
00:34:06,942 --> 00:34:11,364
不是 爸 別因為你不相信我 就這麼想
No. Just because you don't believe me, Pa, don't make it so.

295
00:34:11,464 --> 00:34:14,017
跟你說過了 我做這些都是媽媽想要這樣
I told you I'm doing this because Ma wanted it.

296
00:34:14,117 --> 00:34:18,074
你媽想要的是你從戰場上回來
What your mother wanted was for you to come back from the war.

297
00:34:18,174 --> 00:34:20,591
那你呢 爸
What about you, Pa?

298
00:34:21,591 --> 00:34:23,718
你希望我回來嗎
Did you want me to come back?

299
00:34:24,611 --> 00:34:26,102
非常簡單的問題
Simple enough question.

300
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:29,023
有沒有那麼一秒鐘 你想過戰後我為什麼沒有回來
Did it even bother you that I didn't come back after the war?

301
00:34:29,666 --> 00:34:31,732
你在說什麼
What are you talking about?

302
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:33,912
我在說你拋棄我的那天
I'm talking about the day you turned your back on me,

303
00:34:34,012 --> 00:34:36,239
我弟 威廉 死的那天
the day my brother, William, died.

304
00:34:36,539 --> 00:34:38,217
胡說
That's not true.

305
00:34:38,517 --> 00:34:42,980
媽看見了 不然你以為她為什麼想讓咱倆一起清理這個地方
Ma saw it. Why the hell do you think she wanted us to clear this field together?

306
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:47,318
- 她是想幫我們處理好彼此的關係  - 沒有什麼好處理的
- She tried to help us put things right.  - There was nothing to put right.

307
00:34:50,252 --> 00:34:53,589
這一切就像昨天一樣
I remember it as if it was yesterday.

308
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:56,330
詹金斯先生繞過在河裏的威廉和我
Mr. Jenkins came across William and I down river.

309
00:34:56,430 --> 00:34:59,778
不知道他是怎麼把我們倆拖出來的 然後把我們帶到他的小屋去了
Somehow he managed to drag us out of there, get us up to his cabin.

310
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:02,667
他讓他兒子去找你
He told his boy to go fetch you.

311
00:35:02,767 --> 00:35:06,069
我又冷又怕 止不住地抖
I was so cold and scared I couldn't stop shaking.

312
00:35:06,369 --> 00:35:09,077
你到之後 我聽到他試圖跟你解釋
When you arrived, I could hear Mr. Jenkins trying to explain to you

313
00:35:09,177 --> 00:35:11,125
你一個兒子去世了
that one of your sons had passed.

314
00:35:11,225 --> 00:35:15,130
在聽到那個名字之前 你衝進來 看見我
Before you could get the name out you rushed in and you saw me.

315
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,082
我永遠也忘不了
And I'll never forget it.

316
00:35:18,182 --> 00:35:20,984
你臉上的那種失望
The look of disappointment on your face.

317
00:35:21,584 --> 00:35:24,088
你怎麼能這麼想
How could you think such a thing?

318
00:35:24,488 --> 00:35:26,756
我想錯了嗎
Am I wrong?

319
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:30,494
我沒覺得失望 遠非如此
I didn't feel any disappointment,far from it.

320
00:35:31,862 --> 00:35:34,130
但如果我跟你說 那之後我從沒失望過
But I would be a liar

321
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:37,619
那就是說謊
if I said to you I haven't felt it since.

322
00:35:38,267 --> 00:35:41,244
每當我聽到你的那些"豐功偉績"
When word came back about your exploits,

323
00:35:41,804 --> 00:35:44,563
我都不得不去想
I couldn't help but think that...

324
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:47,697
或許威廉會活得更有意義
William might've made more of his life.

325
00:35:49,345 --> 00:35:51,082
是
Yeah.

326
00:36:40,146 --> 00:36:41,550
查德威克
Chadwick!

327
00:36:57,147 --> 00:36:59,650
有埋伏
It's an ambush!

328
00:37:52,068 --> 00:37:55,739
- 他媽的他們怎麼知道咱們要來的  - 沒準兒他們聽見你說了
- How the hell they know we was coming?  - Maybe they heard ya.

329
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:58,642
那也解釋不了怎麼會有那麼多槍在等著我們
That don't explain why there's so many guns waiting for us.

330
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:03,814
剛聽說查德威克夜裏去搬救兵了 帶著他在蘭德斯的親戚一起回來的
Just heard Chadwick rode through the night and came back with his kin from Landers.

331
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,385
什麼讓他想起要這麼幹的
What would prompt him to do such a thing?

332
00:38:21,564 --> 00:38:24,668
前天這個傢伙嗓門兒那麼大
That one flapped his gum so loud the other day

333
00:38:24,768 --> 00:38:28,305
肯定是有人聽見然後警告他們咱們要去了
someone must've heard him and warned 'em we was coming.

334
00:38:28,905 --> 00:38:32,883
丹·湯普森是個好人 因為一時犯蠢所以喪命
Dan Thompson was a good man,died 'cause of that one's foolishness.

335
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:40,383
讓他把血流乾淨
Let him bleed out.

336
00:38:58,034 --> 00:39:00,571
那片地怎麼樣了
How's the field coming?

337
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:03,440
差不多所有的樹都被砍倒了
Almost all the trees are down.

338
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:07,077
馬上就該開始清理田地了
Should start working the land pretty soon.

339
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:12,751
所以我把你做的這些事理解為你打算留下了
So I take it with all the effort you're putting in that you're planning on staying.

340
00:39:14,284 --> 00:39:16,240
還沒想好
Not sure yet.

341
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,489
為什麼
Why's that?

342
00:39:19,889 --> 00:39:22,392
不知道到底哪裏適合我
Don't exactly know where I fit it.

343
00:39:22,992 --> 00:39:26,631
這是你的家 如果家都不適合你 那你還能去哪兒
This is your home. If a man can't fit in here, where can he?

344
00:39:34,404 --> 00:39:38,158
你有沒有想過 如果戰後你回來了 這一切會是什麼樣子
You ever thought about what it might've been if you'd come back after the war?

345
00:39:43,863 --> 00:39:46,266
所以你從來沒想過
So you never thought about it?

346
00:39:47,016 --> 00:39:50,143
我已經不是當年那個拋下一切離開的人了
I ain't the same as the man that left all them years back.

347
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:54,824
我得知道你為什麼沒回來
I need to understand why you didn't come back.

348
00:39:54,924 --> 00:39:56,960
我想我有這個權利
I think I'm entitled to that much.

349
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:08,454
這會是我第一次也是最後一次說這個事情
I'll say this, and I will say no more on the subject.

350
00:40:08,554 --> 00:40:11,091
回來找你
The thought of coming back to you...

351
00:40:11,541 --> 00:40:14,877
是支撐我熬過那該死的戰爭的唯一希望
was the only thing that got me through that damn war.

352
00:40:15,177 --> 00:40:16,964
我用性命跟你起誓
And when it was over,

353
00:40:17,064 --> 00:40:19,148
戰爭結束之後
I swear to you on my life,

354
00:40:19,248 --> 00:40:21,819
我想盡辦法回來
I tried coming home.

355
00:40:23,586 --> 00:40:26,223
我發誓不再殺人
I swore I was done with killing.

356
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,806
但我卻擺脫不了
She just wasn't done with me.

357
00:40:46,543 --> 00:40:48,912
你還記得你離開的那天嗎
You remember the day you left?

358
00:40:50,414 --> 00:40:53,784
我從頭上解下一條紅絲帶給你
I gave you a red ribbon from my hair.

359
00:40:54,684 --> 00:40:57,291
跟你說 你要一直帶在身邊直到你拿回來還給我
Told you to hold onto it till you could bring it back to me.

360
00:40:57,621 --> 00:40:59,458
記得
Yes, I remember.

361
00:41:01,824 --> 00:41:03,786
還留著嗎
You still have it?

362
00:41:04,186 --> 00:41:06,238
這重要嗎
Does it matter?

363
00:41:06,338 --> 00:41:08,932
我想知道
I'd like to know.

364
00:41:19,041 --> 00:41:22,179
嫁給湯姆是對的 瑪麗·愛麗絲
You were right to marry Tom, Mary Alice.

365
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:25,515
做得對
You were right.

366
00:41:43,533 --> 00:41:45,835
你要見我
You wanted to see me?

367
00:41:47,103 --> 00:41:49,679
我給了你一個簡單的任務
I set you a simple task.

368
00:41:49,779 --> 00:41:52,375
你要不要解釋一下你是怎麼接受這個任務
You wanna explain to me how you took that task

369
00:41:52,475 --> 00:41:55,811
然後把它徹底搞砸的
and fucked it up in every conceivable way?

370
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:59,315
唔 我覺得一切順利
Well, I think everything's all right.

371
00:41:59,721 --> 00:42:01,941
一切順利
Everything's all right.

372
00:42:02,041 --> 00:42:04,421
弄死了兩個人 其中一個還是你親手殺的
You got two men dead,one by your own hand,

373
00:42:04,521 --> 00:42:08,403
查德威克的土地還是他的  我可能沒你聰明
Chadwick's still on his land,and I may not be as clever as you,

374
00:42:08,503 --> 00:42:12,591
但是從我的角度看
but to my way of thinking no way that adds up...

375
00:42:12,691 --> 00:42:15,157
這可沒一件事是順利的
to all right.

376
00:42:15,257 --> 00:42:19,035
如果不快點解決這些事 其他人就會有想法了
If these things aren't dealt with quickly,it could give the others ideas.

377
00:42:19,135 --> 00:42:24,367
我們最不需要的就是這些蠢蛋以為他們可以抵抗我們
The last thing we need is these muddle heads thinking they can stand up to us.

378
00:42:38,438 --> 00:42:40,341
後悔嫁給我了
Regret marrying me?

379
00:42:41,991 --> 00:42:44,627
這是哪門子問題
What kind of question is that?

380
00:42:45,127 --> 00:42:48,364
早些時候我看到約翰·亨利在這兒了
I seen John Henry here earlier today.

381
00:42:48,961 --> 00:42:50,860
所以呢
So?

382
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:54,970
所以 我知道你對他是什麼感覺
So, I know how you felt about him.

383
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:59,035
那是很久之前的事兒了
That was a long time ago.

384
00:43:10,085 --> 00:43:12,589
你才是我丈夫 湯姆
You're my husband, Tom.

385
00:43:13,489 --> 00:43:15,960
我不後悔
I have no regrets.

386
00:44:51,787 --> 00:44:55,991
- 節哀順變  - 別假惺惺了
- I'm sorry for your loss.  - No, you ain't.

387
00:44:56,591 --> 00:44:58,160
最後
Eventually...

388
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:02,031
一定會有人有膽量和你對抗
someone's gonna have the nerve to stand up to you.

389
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:04,701
等到那天
And when that day comes,

390
00:45:05,001 --> 00:45:09,006
我會往你的墳墓上吐口水
I want to be here to spit on your grave.

391
00:45:10,272 --> 00:45:14,452
好吧 女士 想做就做吧
Well, ma'am, feel free to do so.

392
00:45:15,043 --> 00:45:20,458
假如到時候你能擠到前排去的話
Provided you can find your way to the front of the line.

393
00:45:22,918 --> 00:45:25,787
二十磅種子 鹽
20 pounds of seed, salt.

394
00:45:26,687 --> 00:45:30,091
- 今天把賬清了吧  - 好的 教士
- I'll settle the account.  - All right, Reverend.

395
00:45:30,191 --> 00:45:34,149
我有點著急 你不介意我插個隊吧
I'm in a bit of a hurry.You don't mind if I cut in here, do ya?

396
00:45:37,666 --> 00:45:42,405
給我一盒點44的子彈和一瓶那種奎寧水
Gimme a box of .44 skins and a bottle of that tonic water.

397
00:45:42,605 --> 00:45:44,812
有點頭疼
I got me a headache.

398
00:45:56,518 --> 00:45:58,554
完事兒了嗎
You done?

399
00:45:59,822 --> 00:46:02,259
你覺得呢
I look like I'm done?

400
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:09,832
- 叫你催我  - 我會收拾的
- Look what you made me do.  - I'll just clean that up.

401
00:46:09,932 --> 00:46:12,218
不用 不用 沒事兒的
No, no, it's all right.

402
00:46:12,318 --> 00:46:14,687
約翰·亨利會收拾好的
John Henry'll get it.

403
00:46:16,237 --> 00:46:18,642
是吧 約翰·亨利
Won't you, John Henry?

404
00:46:27,716 --> 00:46:32,141
- 乖 全都擦乾淨  - 還有那邊兒那一塊
- Yeah, get it all.  - Don't miss that spot over there.

405
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:35,274
你還弄到我鞋上了
And you got some on my boot.

406
00:46:54,744 --> 00:46:58,882
你知道 你用那種眼神看我也無所謂
You know, I don't care for the way you're looking at me.

407
00:47:09,525 --> 00:47:12,495
知道你的問題是什麼嗎 約翰·亨利
You know what your problem is, John Henry?

408
00:47:12,595 --> 00:47:15,818
你想當個朝聖者
You wanna act like a pilgrim, but...

409
00:47:15,918 --> 00:47:18,802
可惜你還是殺手的做派
you still got the attitude of a killer.

410
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:29,879
我過會兒再來 帕森斯先生
I'll come back later, Mr. Parsons.

411
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:34,298
你以為你能去哪兒
Where do ya think you're going?

412
00:47:34,398 --> 00:47:38,753
- 滾開  - 瞧瞧 又是這樣 又這麼粗魯
- Get out of my way.  - Ya see? There ya go, being rude again.

413
00:47:39,598 --> 00:47:41,485
不要
No!

414
00:47:49,598 --> 00:47:51,834
現在可沒那麼機靈了 是不是 快槍手
Not so smart, are you now, gunslinger?

415
00:47:58,324 --> 00:47:59,593
不要
No!

416
00:48:06,782 --> 00:48:08,284
幫幫忙
Somebody help us.

417
00:48:08,384 --> 00:48:10,587
嘿 嘿 放鬆 我們就是玩玩兒
Hey, hey, come on now. We're just funnin'.

418
00:48:25,067 --> 00:48:27,037
快 奈德 再打他
Come on, Ned, hit him again.

419
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:35,510
來吧 約翰·亨利 站起來
Come on, John Henry, get up.

420
00:48:37,763 --> 00:48:39,900
約翰·亨利 躺著
John Henry, stay down.

421
00:49:11,614 --> 00:49:14,248
誰來救救我們 拜託
Somebody help! Please!

422
00:49:14,348 --> 00:49:17,204
- 是約翰·亨利  - 你去哪兒
- It's John Henry.  - Where you going?

423
00:49:17,504 --> 00:49:20,122
- 他需要幫助  - 其他人會幫他的
- He needs help.  - Well, others will help him.

424
00:49:20,222 --> 00:49:22,558
他是我朋友
He's my friend.

425
00:49:22,858 --> 00:49:25,428
我說回這兒來 婆娘
I said get back here, woman!

426
00:50:21,315 --> 00:50:23,419
歡迎光臨 先生們
Welcome, gentlemen.

427
00:50:23,819 --> 00:50:26,656
快去給先生們拿點喝的
Why don't you get the gentlemen some drinks?

428
00:50:40,335 --> 00:50:43,939
你一定是渴得不行了才會來我這兒
You must be really thirsty to be drinking in my place.

429
00:50:44,639 --> 00:50:46,675
別管我
Let me be.

430
00:50:47,909 --> 00:50:50,946
我聽說街上的事兒了
I heard about what happened on the street.

431
00:50:51,446 --> 00:50:55,584
女人們似乎越來越勇敢了 不是嗎
Seems women get bolder every year, don't they?

432
00:50:56,384 --> 00:51:01,489
我有個提議 對你我都有好處
I believe I have a proposal which might be of benefit to both of us.

433
00:51:01,589 --> 00:51:06,328
雖然我最討厭插手別人的婚姻生活
Now the last thing I want is to interfere in a man's marital affairs,

434
00:51:06,428 --> 00:51:10,264
但似乎你要是能做某些改變
but it appears that a change in locale for you

435
00:51:10,364 --> 00:51:13,902
對你我來說都是個好辦法
might be a solution for both of us.

436
00:51:18,105 --> 00:51:21,176
在雞捨裏抓到狐貍之後
When you got a fox in the henhouse...

437
00:51:21,276 --> 00:51:23,878
只有兩個辦法
only two things to do:

438
00:51:23,978 --> 00:51:27,416
殺了狐貍 或者把雞捨挪走
Kill the fox or move the henhouse.

439
00:51:28,784 --> 00:51:30,992
賣了土地
Sell the land...

440
00:51:31,092 --> 00:51:34,760
拿著錢 搬走吧
take the money, move away.

441
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,786
離這兒遠遠的
Far, far from here...

442
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:40,898
也離約翰·亨利·克萊頓遠遠的
and John Henry Clayton.

443
00:51:48,602 --> 00:51:50,239
成交
Done.

444
00:52:05,087 --> 00:52:07,490
哦 天哪
Oh, my.

445
00:52:08,991 --> 00:52:11,057
你感覺怎麼樣
How are you feeling?

446
00:52:11,157 --> 00:52:13,764
我希望別人不要再問我這個問題了
I wish people would stop asking me that.

447
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:18,711
朋友之間這很正常
It's only natural for friends to inquire.

448
00:52:20,134 --> 00:52:22,604
是嗎 戴夫
Is that what we are, Dave?

449
00:52:22,704 --> 00:52:24,506
咱們是朋友
Friends?

450
00:52:24,806 --> 00:52:27,211
我覺得是
I'd like to think so.

451
00:52:27,543 --> 00:52:29,946
那你跟我說說
Then answer me this...

452
00:52:31,279 --> 00:52:34,015
你覺得這兒對咱們這種人來說是個好地方嗎
Do you think there's a place for men like us to go,

453
00:52:34,115 --> 00:52:35,919
以免繼續殺人
get away from the killing?

454
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:39,176
我的經驗要我說 不是
My experience would lead me to say no.

455
00:52:43,592 --> 00:52:48,463
那場戰爭之後 我跟自己發誓 再也不會拿起槍
After the war I swore to myself I'd never pick up a gun again.

456
00:52:48,863 --> 00:52:53,102
在經歷了那種事之後 你不可能還像原來那樣
You can't go through something like that and expect to be who you were.

457
00:52:53,402 --> 00:52:55,138
我覺得也是
I suppose.

458
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:57,942
我能不能問問 對你來說 最糟糕的是什麼
May I ask,what was the worst of it for you?

459
00:53:00,593 --> 00:53:03,124
毫無疑問 夏洛
Without a doubt, Shiloh.

460
00:53:04,096 --> 00:53:05,919
同意
I would concur.

461
00:53:07,249 --> 00:53:10,885
在梟河的第一天 我失去了很多好朋友
That first day at Owl Creek I lost a lot of good friends.

462
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:13,858
梟河戰役我也在
I was there at Owl Creek.

463
00:53:15,222 --> 00:53:18,628
我不記得看見過你
I do not recall seeing you there.

464
00:53:19,694 --> 00:53:22,127
我在河那邊
I was on the other side of the creek.

465
00:53:23,465 --> 00:53:25,302
好吧
Well.

466
00:53:27,336 --> 00:53:32,384
看起來 歷史就要在你我之間重演了
It would appear the past is close to repeating itself with us.

467
00:53:32,741 --> 00:53:37,380
我感覺到你我正走向不可避免的結局
I feel you and I are headed for an inevitable conclusion.

468
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:40,283
我和你沒有過爭執 戴夫
I got no fight with you, Dave.

469
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:45,398
再說 要是我想找麻煩 你早就該知道了
Besides, if I was looking for trouble,you'd already know it.

470
00:53:45,498 --> 00:53:46,956
怎麼說
How so?

471
00:53:47,456 --> 00:53:51,896
因為如果那樣的話 我就會進城然後殺了弗蘭克和那個大塊頭
'Cause I'd have gone into town and I'd have killed Frank and that big fella.

472
00:53:54,896 --> 00:53:58,133
我很佩服你的自制力 約翰·亨利 真的
I do admire your restraint,John Henry. I do.

473
00:53:58,433 --> 00:54:03,267
上帝知道我沒辦法像你一樣拒絕那些無賴 但是
God knows I could not turn the other cheek the way that you have. But...

474
00:54:03,367 --> 00:54:08,311
我也知道 兔子急了 會咬人的
I also know if you kick a dog long enough, he's gonna bite.

475
00:54:10,044 --> 00:54:12,875
所以 不管是什麼給了你力量
So whatever it is that's given you

476
00:54:12,975 --> 00:54:15,587
讓你選擇置身事外
the strength to stay out of this,

477
00:54:15,687 --> 00:54:17,421
我希望你能堅持下去
I pray you hold on to it.

478
00:54:19,754 --> 00:54:22,992
我不想與你為敵
I don't wanna see you on the other side of that creek.

479
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:34,830
（讚美詩27)耶和華是我的光明 是我的拯救
The Lord is my light and my salvation.

480
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,831
我還要敬畏誰呢
Whom should I fear?

481
00:55:36,931 --> 00:55:39,468
耶和華是我生命的力量
The Lord is the strength of my life.

482
00:55:39,868 --> 00:55:42,371
我還要懼怕誰呢
Of whom shall I be afraid?

483
00:55:44,071 --> 00:55:47,276
耶和華啊 求你將你的道指教給我
Teach me thy way, oh, Lord.

484
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:51,447
因我仇敵的緣故引導我走平坦的路
Lead me in a smooth path because of my enemies.

485
00:55:51,647 --> 00:55:56,501
求你不要把我交給敵人 遂其所願
Do not deliver me to the will of my adversaries.

486
00:55:56,919 --> 00:56:00,009
以及
And such as breathe out...

487
00:56:00,540 --> 00:56:02,544
口吐兇言
violence.

488
00:56:18,039 --> 00:56:20,653
我若不信
I would have lost heart...

489
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:24,169
在活人之地
if I had not believed...

490
00:56:24,269 --> 00:56:27,414
得見耶和華的恩惠
that I would see the goodness of the Lord

491
00:56:27,514 --> 00:56:29,902
就早已喪膽
in the land of the living.

492
00:56:30,352 --> 00:56:32,754
要等候耶和華
Wait for the Lord.

493
00:56:33,354 --> 00:56:35,804
你當壯膽
Be of good courage...

494
00:56:36,004 --> 00:56:38,680
他會堅固你的心
and he shall strengthen your heart.

495
00:56:38,780 --> 00:56:43,031
我說 要等候耶和華
Wait, I say, on the Lord.

496
00:56:43,131 --> 00:56:44,834
阿門
Amen.

497
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:54,409
- 嘿  - 嘿
- Hey there.  - Hey.

498
00:56:55,109 --> 00:56:58,046
看到你又能到這兒來真好
It's good to see you finding your way back.

499
00:56:58,146 --> 00:57:00,549
- 謝謝  - 現在該走了
- Thank you.  - We're leaving now!

500
00:57:01,349 --> 00:57:03,518
離她遠點
You stay away from her.

501
00:57:04,552 --> 00:57:08,925
- 你說什麼呢 湯姆 - 你以為我沒看見是怎麼回事兒嗎
- What are you saying, Tom?  - You don't think I see what's going on?

502
00:57:10,524 --> 00:57:12,406
怎麼回事兒
What's going on?

503
00:57:12,506 --> 00:57:16,281
- 湯姆  - 教士 別管
- Tom.  - Stay out of this, Reverend.

504
00:57:16,431 --> 00:57:18,701
看看我們大家
Look at all of us?

505
00:57:19,851 --> 00:57:23,530
這麼多年之後他回來了 咱們都笑容滿面 張開雙臂
He comes back here after all these years and we welcome him home with...

506
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:26,442
歡迎他回家
smiles and open arms.

507
00:57:26,842 --> 00:57:28,710
為什麼
Why?

508
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,914
我來告訴你們為什麼
I'll tell you why.

509
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:34,283
因為咱們都怕他
'Cause we're all afraid of him...

510
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:37,387
怕他做過的那些事 也怕他可能會做的事
and the things he's done and things he might do.

511
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:43,794
你以為這麼多年之後 你可以光明正大地回來
You think you can walk back in here after all these years and just...

512
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,428
然後若無其事地跟之前一樣嗎
pick up where you left off?

513
00:57:46,528 --> 00:57:49,866
我知道你在想什麼 湯姆 但是你錯了
I understand what you're thinking, Tom, but you're wrong.

514
00:57:50,666 --> 00:57:53,001
那你跟我說你不愛她
Then tell me you don't love her.

515
00:57:53,801 --> 00:57:55,603
說啊
Go on.

516
00:57:55,703 --> 00:57:57,930
我要你在上帝面前
I want you to tell me in front of God,

517
00:57:58,030 --> 00:58:01,394
在你父親和所有人面前 跟我說 你不愛她
your father, and everyone here that you don't love her.

518
00:58:02,244 --> 00:58:04,313
說啊
Say it!

519
00:58:06,948 --> 00:58:09,385
說你不愛她
Tell me you don't love her!

520
00:58:38,246 --> 00:58:40,382
你誤會他了 湯姆
You're wrong about him, Tom.

521
00:58:57,465 --> 00:58:59,735
麥科迪先生 我需要跟你談談
Mr. McCurdy, I need to talk to you.

522
00:58:59,935 --> 00:59:03,374
你要簽的合同週二就會準備好
The papers will be ready for you to sign Tuesday.

523
00:59:03,474 --> 00:59:06,169
不是 我不要賣給你了
No, I've decided not to sell to you.

524
00:59:07,124 --> 00:59:08,568
好笑嗎
Something funny?

525
00:59:08,668 --> 00:59:12,722
我耳朵總是愛逗我
I'm amused at how many times my ears play tricks on me.

526
00:59:12,822 --> 00:59:16,028
有那麼一刻 我以為聽見你說你不想繼續我們的交易了
For a moment I thought I heard you say you wish to extricate yourself

527
00:59:16,128 --> 00:59:19,755
當然 我知道你不會那麼說的
from the agreement we made. Of course,I know you couldn't've said that.

528
00:59:19,855 --> 00:59:22,500
可我確實說了 瞧 我一直在考慮
I did say that. See, I been thinking my...

529
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,693
閉嘴
Shut up!

530
00:59:28,696 --> 00:59:31,076
在你胡說八道之前 最好先想想
Before you open your yap again,I want you to consider

531
00:59:31,176 --> 00:59:33,868
你這種愚蠢行為會帶來什麼後果
the full ramifications of your fucking actions.

532
00:59:35,368 --> 00:59:37,418
咱們已經談好了
We had a deal.

533
00:59:37,518 --> 00:59:41,676
- 可我沒簽合同  - 話也說了 手也握了
- I didn't sign nothing.  - Words were spoke. Hands were shook.

534
00:59:41,776 --> 00:59:43,582
我改主意了
Well, I've had a change of heart.

535
00:59:43,682 --> 00:59:46,161
我意識到 當你還保有原來的感覺的時候
Come to realize that a new start don't mean much if you...

536
00:59:46,261 --> 00:59:50,651
- 一個新開始並沒多大意義  - 這可是他媽的非常深刻啊 湯姆
- you carrying old feelings with you.  - Well, that's very fucking deep, Tom.

537
00:59:50,751 --> 00:59:52,786
都有那麼點詩意了
Almost poetic.

538
00:59:52,886 --> 00:59:56,858
在我擦掉眼淚的時候 我得說
And as I wipe a weepy tear from my eye let me say this...

539
00:59:57,358 --> 01:00:01,502
我不是什麼有原則的人  但是如果一個人和我握了手
I'm not one who holds high principles,but when a man shakes my hand...

540
01:00:01,602 --> 01:00:03,631
還說他要做些什麼的話
and says he's gonna do something,

541
01:00:03,731 --> 01:00:06,168
我希望他言而有信
I expect him to follow through.

542
01:00:06,768 --> 01:00:10,605
週二打烊之前來
Now you'll be here before the end of business Tuesday

543
01:00:10,705 --> 01:00:14,600
簽了合同 然後跟這個地方永別
and sign those papers,and bid this town a fond farewell

544
01:00:14,700 --> 01:00:18,847
要不就準備承受可怕的後果吧
or suffer the fucking consequences.

545
01:01:01,690 --> 01:01:04,212
唔 我不會坐在這兒
Well, I ain't gonna just sit here pretending that you and I

546
01:01:04,312 --> 01:01:07,168
假裝你跟我在任何一件事上
have ever seen eye to eye on, well...

547
01:01:07,563 --> 01:01:09,999
看對方順眼過
pretty much anything.

548
01:01:11,799 --> 01:01:14,136
我一直沒來這兒祈求原諒
Reason I ain't coming here begging for forgiveness

549
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:17,016
是因為我覺得我不配
is because I don't think I deserve it.

550
01:01:17,716 --> 01:01:22,039
但是如果你能讓我的目標更清楚點兒的話 我會很感激的
But I would be mighty grateful if you could make my purpose a little more clear to me.

551
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:54,108
回家之前 我一直是漫無目的地
Before I came home, I was just drifting.

552
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:58,746
從一個地方到另一個地方
Town to town.

553
01:01:58,846 --> 01:02:02,826
最後到一個叫諾頓的小城裏 在堪薩斯那邊兒
Ended up in a small place called Norton, way over in Kansas.

554
01:02:04,385 --> 01:02:08,715
騎馬騎累了 就去小酒館喝酒
Been riding hard,went in the saloon for a drink.

555
01:02:09,115 --> 01:02:13,231
兩個人過來找我想打架 我就收拾了他們一下
Two men come up on me looking for a fight, so I gave it to 'em.

556
01:02:14,529 --> 01:02:17,831
把其中一個切碎了 扔給另外一個
Cut one of 'em up pretty bad,outdrew on the other.

557
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:21,165
讓他把他朋友都撿起來然後拼起來
Told him to pick up his partner and get.

558
01:02:24,839 --> 01:02:27,909
我必須得離開那個城鎮
All I had to do was leave that town.

559
01:02:29,610 --> 01:02:32,100
但我沒有
But I didn't.

560
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,050
我等著
I waited.

561
01:02:34,734 --> 01:02:37,575
等他們敢來找我
Daring 'em to come after me.

562
01:02:39,485 --> 01:02:41,966
當然
And sure enough...

563
01:02:42,616 --> 01:02:46,994
我走出去的時候 有兩個年輕人朝我開槍
when I walked outside those two young men started firing on me.

564
01:02:47,094 --> 01:02:50,975
打中我的馬 我拔出槍 回擊
Shot out my horse.I drew my pistol. I fired back.

565
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:53,904
我殺了他們
I killed them.

566
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:56,416
他們兩個都死了
Killed them both.

567
01:02:58,505 --> 01:03:01,043
其中有一發子彈射偏了
In the middle of all of it one of my shots went wide,

568
01:03:01,143 --> 01:03:03,711
直直打穿一家商店的窗戶
straight through a storefront window.

569
01:03:06,514 --> 01:03:09,150
一個女人大喊著跑出來
Woman came out screaming,

570
01:03:09,945 --> 01:03:12,334
身上都是血
covered in blood.

571
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:15,756
起初我以為我打中了她
First I thought I'd shot her.

572
01:03:18,725 --> 01:03:21,329
然後她丈夫跑出來
Then her husband come out...

573
01:03:24,598 --> 01:03:27,001
抱著一個小男孩
carrying a little boy.

574
01:03:30,104 --> 01:03:32,974
我殺了一個孩子 爸
I killed a boy, Pop.

575
01:03:34,424 --> 01:03:36,387
他看上去和威廉一樣大
He looked to be the same age as William.

576
01:03:36,487 --> 01:03:40,715
他是因為我的所作所為死的 就像威廉一樣
He just lay there dead 'cause of what I'd done. Just like William did.

577
01:03:40,815 --> 01:03:44,485
威廉不是因你而死的 你不需要為他負責
William didn't die because of you.You're not responsible for your brother...

578
01:03:44,585 --> 01:03:46,435
你告訴過我不要帶他去河邊
You told me not to take him down to the river.

579
01:03:46,535 --> 01:03:50,526
我跟你們倆都說過 你們只不過做了小男孩都會做的事
I told both of you.You were boys doing what boys do.

580
01:03:50,626 --> 01:03:54,628
那是場意外 很悲劇 但是意外
It was an accident.Tragic, but an accident.

581
01:03:54,728 --> 01:03:57,766
我常想 我弟會長大後會是什麼樣的
I often think about what my brother would've grown up to be.

582
01:03:57,866 --> 01:04:00,432
現在 我一直在想那個諾頓的小男孩
Now I can't stop thinking about what that little boy from Norton

583
01:04:00,534 --> 01:04:02,938
他長大會是什麼樣子的
would've grown up to be.

584
01:04:04,737 --> 01:04:07,441
我唯一知道的就是
The only thing I know that's true in my heart

585
01:04:07,541 --> 01:04:12,080
他們倆都會成為比我更好的人
is that both of those boys would've grown up to be a far cry better than me.

586
01:04:13,648 --> 01:04:17,485
爸 對不起我變成這樣的人
Pa, I'm so sorry for what I've become.

587
01:04:36,303 --> 01:04:38,164
查理 查理
Charlie, Charlie.

588
01:04:38,264 --> 01:04:40,595
快 待在屋裏
Go on, stay inside.

589
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:43,412
能和你說幾句話嗎 女士
Might I have a word with you, ma'am?

590
01:04:44,178 --> 01:04:46,882
據我所知 我們沒什麼往來吧 麥科迪先生
We have no business that I know of, Mr. McCurdy.

591
01:04:47,282 --> 01:04:49,099
據你所知
That you know of.

592
01:04:49,199 --> 01:04:53,219
你丈夫跟我談過他要賣農場的事
Your husband and I have spoken about him selling his farm.

593
01:04:53,319 --> 01:04:56,332
唔 如果他有這個想法 我會很吃驚的
Well, I'd be surprised if my husband entertained such an idea.

594
01:04:56,432 --> 01:04:59,004
呵呵 女士 要是這都讓你吃驚的話
Well, ma'am, if that surprises you,

595
01:04:59,104 --> 01:05:03,115
那你知道他同意賣掉房產的話肯定會驚訝到說不出話來
you'll be dumbstruck to learn he's agreed to the sale of the property.

596
01:05:04,165 --> 01:05:05,681
我不信
I don't believe you.

597
01:05:05,781 --> 01:05:07,970
嗯 對我來說無所謂
Well, that's of little concern to me,

598
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,134
因為他才是名義上的一家之主
being as he's the title holder.

599
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:13,942
離開我家
I want you off my land.

600
01:05:14,049 --> 01:05:16,891
你擁有這項權力
And you have every right to do so...

601
01:05:16,991 --> 01:05:19,014
的有效期還剩下
for another...

602
01:05:19,114 --> 01:05:22,303
32個小時零18分鐘
32 hours and 18 minutes.

603
01:05:22,473 --> 01:05:24,652
如果我們還在這兒呢
And if we're still here?

604
01:05:24,752 --> 01:05:27,887
那我就會開始找喪服了
Then I'd start looking for a black dress.

605
01:05:29,423 --> 01:05:31,226
咱們走
Let's go.

606
01:05:53,382 --> 01:05:55,451
麥科迪想要我們的土地
McCurdy wants our land.

607
01:05:55,751 --> 01:05:58,452
你應該跟你丈夫說
You should be speaking with your husband.

608
01:05:58,552 --> 01:06:00,556
我現在在跟你說
I'm speaking to you.

609
01:06:00,956 --> 01:06:05,534
湯姆和麥科迪做了筆交易 但是現在他後悔了
Tom made a deal with McCurdy and now he's changed his mind.

610
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:08,878
瑪麗·愛麗絲 你應該回家然後跟你丈夫說這些
Mary Alice, you need to go home and speak with your husband.

611
01:06:08,978 --> 01:06:11,519
他會去送死的
He's gonna get himself killed.

612
01:06:11,619 --> 01:06:13,925
我不想我兒子經歷這些
I don't want that for my boy.

613
01:06:14,469 --> 01:06:18,534
你知道他為什麼要這麼做 為了證明他和你一樣強
You know why he's doing this.To prove that he's as good as you are.

614
01:06:21,710 --> 01:06:26,180
瑪麗·愛麗絲 我之前見過這種事 只可能有一個結果
Mary Alice, I've seen this before and it only ends one way.

615
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:27,865
你想救你的家庭嗎
You wanna save your family?

616
01:06:27,965 --> 01:06:31,403
那就接受麥科迪的提議然後搬走 明白嗎
You take what McCurdy's offering and you move away. You understand me?

617
01:06:31,503 --> 01:06:33,791
搬走吧
You move away.

618
01:06:44,866 --> 01:06:47,035
抱歉 麥科迪先生
Excuse me, Mr. McCurdy?

619
01:06:47,135 --> 01:06:49,638
教士來了 他有話要跟你說
Reverend's here. He wants a word with you.

620
01:06:49,938 --> 01:06:52,507
他說是關於什麼的了嗎
Did he say what it's about?

621
01:06:52,607 --> 01:06:56,283
- 湯姆·華生  - 我就該猜到 讓他進來
- Tom Watson.  - I should've known. Show him in.

622
01:07:04,051 --> 01:07:06,861
你放過華生一家吧 詹姆斯
You're to leave the Watsons alone, James.

623
01:07:06,961 --> 01:07:09,421
你真是愛多管閒事 塞繆爾
You sure do have a repetitive nature, Samuel.

624
01:07:09,521 --> 01:07:11,672
- 我說真的  - 什麼
- I mean it.  - Mean what?

625
01:07:12,072 --> 01:07:14,263
我要是不呢 你怎麼辦
What are you gonna do if I don't?

626
01:07:14,363 --> 01:07:18,014
請主用一道閃電劈死我嗎
Command the Lord to strike me dead with a lightning bolt?

627
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:22,136
我們曾是朋友
We were friends.

628
01:07:22,536 --> 01:07:24,905
我請求你
I'm asking you...

629
01:07:25,005 --> 01:07:28,210
放過湯姆·華生吧
stop doing what you're doing to Tom Watson.

630
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:32,403
湯姆·華生握了我的手也同意交易
Tom Watson shook my hand and agreed to a deal.

631
01:07:32,503 --> 01:07:35,317
- 他不會走的  - 他會的
- He's not going to leave.  - He will.

632
01:07:35,417 --> 01:07:38,582
不管哪種方法 他會走的
One way or another, he will.

633
01:08:29,904 --> 01:08:33,441
你幹了什麼  不
You did what? No!

634
01:08:34,751 --> 01:08:37,007
你他媽
What are you...

635
01:08:38,102 --> 01:08:41,216
你搖什麼頭
What are you shaking your head at?

636
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:45,808
真是蠢 弗蘭克
A damn fool, Frank.

637
01:08:46,419 --> 01:08:50,841
你做了唯一會把約翰·亨利·克萊頓扯進來的事
You did the one thing that will bring John Henry Clayton into this.

638
01:09:06,507 --> 01:09:09,176
- 爸  - 在後面
- Pa!  - In the back.

639
01:09:13,463 --> 01:09:16,468
- 他怎麼樣了  - 還不知道
- How is he?  - I don't know yet.

640
01:09:17,518 --> 01:09:19,320
爸
Pa.

641
01:09:36,437 --> 01:09:38,240
約翰·亨利
John Henry.

642
01:09:41,275 --> 01:09:42,591
他怎麼樣
How is he?

643
01:09:42,691 --> 01:09:47,682
沒傷到要害 但他流了很多血
Well, the blade missed any vital organs,but he did lose a fair amount of blood.

644
01:09:47,782 --> 01:09:50,536
- 早晨就能更確定了  - 我想看看他
- We'll know more in the morning.  - I wanna see him.

645
01:09:50,636 --> 01:09:52,653
他沒恢復意識
He's not conscious.

646
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:55,250
我只想坐著陪他
I just wanna sit with him.

647
01:10:16,277 --> 01:10:19,046
別想丟下我 老傢伙
Don't you even think of leaving me, old man.

648
01:10:19,146 --> 01:10:21,181
不是現在
Not now.

649
01:10:21,281 --> 01:10:24,119
不是在我們經歷過這一切之後
Not after everything we've come through.

650
01:10:57,550 --> 01:11:01,803
- 我去找醫生  - 不 聽我說 兒子
- I'll get the doc.  - No. Listen to me, son.

651
01:11:02,055 --> 01:11:04,693
有些事我必須告訴你
I have to tell you something.

652
01:11:06,528 --> 01:11:08,596
我錯了
I was wrong.

653
01:11:09,196 --> 01:11:11,568
對於你的事 我看錯了
I was wrong about you,

654
01:11:11,668 --> 01:11:14,064
也看錯了我自己
and I was wrong about me.

655
01:11:14,164 --> 01:11:18,289
那個大傢伙 如果可以我會殺了他
That big fella,I would've killed him if I could've.

656
01:11:18,389 --> 01:11:20,992
我會殺了他們所有人
I would've killed all of them.

657
01:11:21,842 --> 01:11:24,278
你和我
You and me...

658
01:11:25,380 --> 01:11:27,199
咱們流著同樣的血
we are the same blood.

659
01:11:35,356 --> 01:11:37,391
我很害怕 約翰·亨利
I'm filled with fear, John Henry.

660
01:11:37,491 --> 01:11:41,362
- 你會好起來的 爸  - 不 不 不是為我自己
- You're gonna be fine, Pop.  - No, no, not for me.

661
01:11:42,162 --> 01:11:46,317
我是害怕會失去你 我讀懂了你的眼神
I'm fearful I'm gonna lose you.I can see what's in your eyes.

662
01:11:51,605 --> 01:11:56,344
- 那你就會知道我要去做什麼  - 你什麼都不需要做
- Then you know what I gotta do.  - You don't have to do anything.

663
01:11:56,444 --> 01:11:59,147
但你我都知道我會做的
But we both know I will.

664
01:12:03,316 --> 01:12:04,919
我去找醫生
I'll get the doc.

665
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:08,656
約翰·亨利·克萊頓 停下
John Henry Clayton, you stop.

666
01:12:11,058 --> 01:12:13,606
約翰·亨利 拜託
John Henry, please.

667
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:21,669
拜託
Please...

668
01:12:21,769 --> 01:12:23,839
就當為了我
for me...

669
01:12:25,139 --> 01:12:26,913
別去
don't.

670
01:12:27,013 --> 01:12:29,276
除非有人結束這一切 爸 否則這些事會繼續下去
This ain't gonna end, Pa,till someone ends it.

671
01:12:29,376 --> 01:12:32,847
但不是你 不非得是你啊
Not you. It doesn't have to be you.

672
01:12:33,347 --> 01:12:36,384
我這一生中 該做點兒對的事情了
It's time I did something right in my life.

673
01:12:37,884 --> 01:12:40,291
我知道該怎麼做
This is what I know how to do.

674
01:13:37,411 --> 01:13:40,082
帕森斯先生 這是勒馬特的嗎
Mr. Parsons, is that a LeMat?

675
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,148
是的 先生
Yes, sir.

676
01:13:42,248 --> 01:13:46,553
一個月前 我從一個哥們兒那買來的
I... bought it off a fella about a month ago.

677
01:13:48,622 --> 01:13:51,492
真是個美人兒 不是嗎
She's a real beauty, ain't she?

678
01:13:51,592 --> 01:13:54,729
9發子彈 10口徑的槍管
Nine shots in a 10 gauge shotgun barrel.

679
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:59,222
給你個公道價
And I can let you have it for a fair price.

680
01:14:00,500 --> 01:14:04,371
或者你可以借走用
Or you can just borrow it.

681
01:15:23,784 --> 01:15:26,521
我想你就是他們口中的"小奈德"
I suspect you're the one they call Little Ned?

682
01:15:34,127 --> 01:15:35,807
是
That's right.

683
01:15:49,842 --> 01:15:54,074
所有今天不想死的人 我建議你們解除武器然後快走
All you young 'uns who ain't willing to die today, I suggest you unarm yourselves and get.

684
01:15:54,174 --> 01:15:56,718
待著別動 小伙子們
Stay where you are, boys.

685
01:16:07,293 --> 01:16:09,797
去你媽的
Goddamn you.

686
01:17:15,598 --> 01:17:17,616
操
Fuck!

687
01:18:24,932 --> 01:18:27,259
口渴了嗎 弗蘭克
Mouth getting dry, Frank?

688
01:18:28,068 --> 01:18:30,906
你是想請我喝一杯嗎
You offering to buy me a drink?

689
01:19:21,921 --> 01:19:24,224
約翰·亨利
John Henry.

690
01:19:34,568 --> 01:19:36,919
不管接下來發生什麼
Whatever happens next,

691
01:19:37,019 --> 01:19:41,558
我需要你知道 我從沒准許過針對你父親的那種懦弱行為
I want you to know I did not sanction that cowardly act against your father.

692
01:19:41,658 --> 01:19:43,375
就我個人來說 我覺得他們的行為實在太該死了
Personally, I found their actions damnable

693
01:19:43,475 --> 01:19:46,181
也活該接受你帶給他們的命運
and deserving of the fate you brought upon them.

694
01:19:46,747 --> 01:19:48,848
然後你會走嗎
Then you'll be leaving?

695
01:19:48,948 --> 01:19:51,184
不能
Can't do that.

696
01:19:51,284 --> 01:19:54,549
沒有人會雇一個遇到麻煩就跑路的槍手
No one hires a gunman who runs from trouble.

697
01:19:56,089 --> 01:19:59,193
你不非得跑 戴夫 你可以用走的
You don't have to run, Dave. You can walk.

698
01:20:01,127 --> 01:20:05,600
我的僱傭條款不會允許我這麼做
The terms of my employment would not allow me to do that.

699
01:20:26,253 --> 01:20:29,747
這把勒馬特可是太沉了 對我很不利啊
This here LeMat's mighty heavy.Puts me at a disadvantage.

700
01:20:31,157 --> 01:20:33,210
你在暗示什麼
What would you suggest?

701
01:20:33,981 --> 01:20:38,285
行個方便 讓我回去拿我的柯爾特如何
Would you be kind enough to let me go back inside and retrieve myself a Colt?

702
01:20:51,244 --> 01:20:53,281
謝謝
Thank you.

703
01:22:28,741 --> 01:22:31,378
我的朋友 你不再受雇於人了
My friend, you are no longer employed.

704
01:22:42,121 --> 01:22:45,191
看起來你是對的
It would appear you are correct.

705
01:22:54,734 --> 01:22:56,737
很高興認識你 戴夫
It's been a pleasure knowing you, Dave.

706
01:23:34,157 --> 01:23:35,599
我很好 爸
I'm all right, Pa.

707
01:23:37,844 --> 01:23:41,296
今天發生的這些事不難解釋
It's not gonna take long for word to get out on what happened here today.

708
01:23:41,396 --> 01:23:44,185
很快就會有外面的人為了出名來找我
Men from far and wide are gonna come looking for me to make a name for themselves.

709
01:23:44,285 --> 01:23:46,518
別走
Don't go away.

710
01:23:46,618 --> 01:23:49,027
我沒辦法自己搞定那片地
I can't finish the field on my own.

711
01:23:49,127 --> 01:23:52,092
我已經都做好了 爸 我已經播種了
The field's finished, Pa. I seeded it.

712
01:23:52,192 --> 01:23:54,761
它會自己好好生長的
It'll take care of itself.

713
01:23:55,361 --> 01:23:57,363
我必須走
I gotta go.

714
01:23:57,463 --> 01:24:00,933
你不會再離開10年吧
You're not going for another 10 years, are you?

715
01:24:01,340 --> 01:24:05,105
不會的 我保證 很快就回來看你 爸
No, I promise. See you soon, Pa.

716
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:28,629
他之後的生活很少有人知道
<i>Little is known of him after that. </i>

717
01:24:28,729 --> 01:24:30,997
有些人說他去了科菲維爾
<i>Some say he drifted down to Coffeeville</i>

718
01:24:31,097 --> 01:24:34,534
幾年以後 在那兒
<i>where he was involved in another altercation</i>

719
01:24:34,634 --> 01:24:36,470
他又捲入了一場爭端
<i>a few years later.</i>

720
01:24:36,570 --> 01:24:40,472
但是這些指控從未被證實過
<i>But those accusations were never proven.</i>

721
01:24:40,972 --> 01:24:44,478
普遍的觀點認為 他用化名搬到了西邊
<i>The common view was he moved westward under a different name,</i>

722
01:24:44,578 --> 01:24:48,516
在那裏 他孤獨地度過了一生
<i>where he lived a life of quiet isolation.</i>

723
01:24:53,415 --> 01:24:57,239
為人所知的是 幾年之後瑪麗·愛麗絲過世之後
<i>What is known is that when Mary Alice died a few years later,</i>

724
01:24:57,339 --> 01:24:59,993
他沒有出席她的葬禮
<i>he did not attend her funeral.</i>

725
01:25:00,093 --> 01:25:03,764
但是 很多人都說 隔天
<i>However, many say the following day,</i>

726
01:25:03,864 --> 01:25:08,335
她的墓碑上繫著一條褪色的紅絲帶
<i>a faded red ribbon was found attached to her headstone.</i>

727
01:25:16,942 --> 01:25:21,328
多年來 福勒的其他人一直信誓旦旦地說又見到過他
<i>Others in Fowler recounted stories of seeing him throughout the years</i>

728
01:25:21,428 --> 01:25:23,884
直到他父親去世
<i>up until his father's death,</i>

729
01:25:23,984 --> 01:25:28,055
自那之後 他再也沒回來過
<i>at which time he came no more.</i>
