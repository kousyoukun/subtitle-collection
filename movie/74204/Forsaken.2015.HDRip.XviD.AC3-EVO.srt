1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074

2
00:04:52,256 --> 00:04:56,194
Your mother is dead.

3
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:56,187
I did not know
that she had passed.

4
00:05:58,223 --> 00:06:00,292
How could you?

5
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:09,934
If I had known that she
had been sick, I'd have...

6
00:06:09,968 --> 00:06:12,004
You would've done what?

7
00:06:12,504 --> 00:06:15,474
You would've come home
if you knew she was dying?

8
00:06:15,506 --> 00:06:18,242
But you couldn't come home
when she was living,

9
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:21,079
when she was full of hope?

10
00:06:32,324 --> 00:06:34,826
How did she pass?

11
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:41,867
In my arms,

12
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,904
lying beside me in bed.

13
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,840
Weeping.

14
00:06:48,973 --> 00:06:51,376
Calling out your name.

15
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:58,751
Is it your plan
to stay a while?

16
00:07:00,285 --> 00:07:02,455
Not sure yet.

17
00:07:05,223 --> 00:07:07,292
You don't wear guns.

18
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:11,829
I put them away.
I'm done with that.

19
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:17,470
What is that
supposed to mean?

20
00:07:19,537 --> 00:07:24,210
It means I don't know if a man
can get away from who he is.

21
00:07:25,276 --> 00:07:28,146
And you think you know
who I am?

22
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:30,749
I thought I did.

23
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:08,480
I'll be back.
I have to go into town.

24
00:09:08,512 --> 00:09:10,548
I'll go with ya.

25
00:10:03,434 --> 00:10:05,536
Morning, Reverend.

26
00:10:05,569 --> 00:10:09,507
And I'll be right with,
you, sir, just as soon as I...

27
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:12,376
Lord sakes! John Henry,
is that you?

28
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,379
Hello, Mr. Parsons.

29
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:16,447
Lord almighty,
John Henry.

30
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:19,451
I ain't seen you since
you went off to war.

31
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:22,286
I asked the saloon to order
some sipping cider

32
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:24,289
from Cheyenne for me.

33
00:10:24,322 --> 00:10:26,425
Would you see if
it's arrived please?

34
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:28,459
Mr. Parsons.

35
00:10:29,526 --> 00:10:33,230
Must do your heart good
to see the boy again.

36
00:10:33,264 --> 00:10:35,534
I have a list.

37
00:10:46,477 --> 00:10:49,314
Reverend Clayton sent me
to pick up his cider.

38
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:50,849
And who are you?

39
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:52,351
His son, John Henry.

40
00:11:00,091 --> 00:11:03,262
Well, well, well.

41
00:11:04,261 --> 00:11:07,665
If it ain't
John Henry Clayton.

42
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:11,236
I heard a lot about you.

43
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:15,006
Name's Frank Tillman.

44
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,141
Maybe you heard of me?

45
00:11:17,175 --> 00:11:20,679
Can't say as I have.

46
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:24,583
Well, I killed
four men.

47
00:11:24,616 --> 00:11:28,420
Still don't ring a bell.

48
00:11:34,825 --> 00:11:37,728
How come you ain't
wearing a gun?

49
00:11:37,761 --> 00:11:42,133
You go and, get
religion or something?

50
00:11:42,166 --> 00:11:44,335
Git!

51
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:46,604
Stop pestering our guests.

52
00:11:46,637 --> 00:11:49,641
Git.

53
00:12:00,285 --> 00:12:03,088
My name is Dave Turner.

54
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:06,191
Some call me
Gentleman Dave.

55
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:10,228
Yeah, I heard of you.

56
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:15,767
You're gonna have to
forgive my compatriots.

57
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,670
Boredom often gets
the best of 'em.

58
00:12:18,703 --> 00:12:23,308
I had the good fortune of
watching you rid this world

59
00:12:23,341 --> 00:12:26,378
of Big Jim Westfield

60
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:30,181
down in Coldwell County
a few years back.

61
00:12:30,214 --> 00:12:33,285
Most impressive.

62
00:12:33,318 --> 00:12:37,356
May I ask what brings you
to Fowler?

63
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:47,699
I'm only trying to ascertain
the nature of our relationship.

64
00:12:47,732 --> 00:12:51,069
I'm hoping there
won't be any trouble.

65
00:12:53,737 --> 00:12:56,474
Not from me.

66
00:13:03,915 --> 00:13:06,251
I don't recall things
being so prosperous.

67
00:13:06,284 --> 00:13:08,253
Prosperous to some.

68
00:13:08,285 --> 00:13:10,289
Railroad's coming.

69
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:13,625
Buggy's not gonna
load itself.

70
00:13:17,828 --> 00:13:20,364
Take these.

71
00:13:20,397 --> 00:13:23,200
Take this. Don't you
spend it all at once.

72
00:13:23,233 --> 00:13:25,203
Mr. McCurdy,

73
00:13:25,236 --> 00:13:29,241
guess who was just in here
not five minutes ago?

74
00:13:29,274 --> 00:13:31,876
John Henry Clayton.

75
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:36,714
Is he gonna be a problem?

76
00:13:36,747 --> 00:13:39,550
He didn't look
too tough to me.

77
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,386
I'm not asking you.

78
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:48,593
Is he gonna be a problem?

79
00:13:48,626 --> 00:13:51,596
He was not wearing
a sidearm.

80
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:54,732
That doesn't mean
he can't put one on.

81
00:13:54,766 --> 00:13:57,468
If he takes his pa's side
in this,

82
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,905
it could be a problem.

83
00:14:00,939 --> 00:14:02,908
Well,

84
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:07,179
why don't you just
leave all that to me?

85
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:16,288
What are they doing here?

86
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,756
You don't know?

87
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,593
How would I?

88
00:14:21,626 --> 00:14:23,595
I thought maybe
your coming here

89
00:14:23,627 --> 00:14:26,198
might have something
to do with them.

90
00:14:27,699 --> 00:14:30,202
Well, it don't.

91
00:14:32,303 --> 00:14:34,673
They work for McCurdy.

92
00:14:34,705 --> 00:14:38,609
He got his mind set on
buying every farm around here.

93
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,744
Folks who don't wanna sell,

94
00:14:40,777 --> 00:14:45,749
they got some persuading
from those fellas over there.

95
00:14:45,782 --> 00:14:49,286
If you don't know 'em,
you better stay away from them.

96
00:14:49,319 --> 00:14:51,455
Those are damned men.

97
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:54,192
Those are godless men.

98
00:16:10,934 --> 00:16:14,372
Is it your plan to come
to church tomorrow?

99
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:17,442
Is that an invitation, Pa?

100
00:16:17,474 --> 00:16:19,477
Come back here!

101
00:16:30,521 --> 00:16:33,357
What is the reason
you came home?

102
00:16:33,391 --> 00:16:36,361
I didn't know I had
to have a reason, Pa.

103
00:16:36,394 --> 00:16:38,897
If you want me to go, I'll go.

104
00:16:38,929 --> 00:16:42,666
I'm a forthright man.
You're an embarrassment to me.

105
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:46,603
Today in there,
all I felt was shame.

106
00:16:46,636 --> 00:16:49,040
But if you come back
committed to God

107
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:51,076
to truly change your ways,

108
00:16:51,108 --> 00:16:54,545
then it's God's edict that
I forgive you and I do.

109
00:16:54,578 --> 00:16:56,647
But in your mother's name

110
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,383
I cannot forget
the past 10 years.

111
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,786
I cannot.

112
00:17:03,854 --> 00:17:06,625
I know.

113
00:17:44,995 --> 00:17:48,367
What in the world
are you doing?

114
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,636
Ma always wanted us to
clear this field together.

115
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:55,506
You and me?
No, she didn't.

116
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,010
As far as I recall it's the only
thing she ever asked of us.

117
00:17:59,042 --> 00:18:01,011
Not me.

118
00:18:01,044 --> 00:18:03,147
Fine. I'll do it alone.

119
00:18:03,181 --> 00:18:05,650
All right.

120
00:18:13,523 --> 00:18:17,896
I would have lost heart
if I had not believed

121
00:18:17,928 --> 00:18:22,032
that I would see the goodness
of the Lord's light.

122
00:18:22,066 --> 00:18:24,636
Be of good courage

123
00:18:24,668 --> 00:18:27,505
and he shall give you strength.

124
00:18:33,578 --> 00:18:35,579
Excuse me.

125
00:18:39,684 --> 00:18:41,752
Gentleman.

126
00:18:44,088 --> 00:18:47,125
We think we should bring in
our own hired guns.

127
00:18:47,157 --> 00:18:48,176
That's right.

128
00:18:48,177 --> 00:18:49,194
Yep.

129
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:54,665
Hired gun. To do what?
Start a war? Kill everyone?

130
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:56,667
Guns are not the answer.

131
00:18:56,701 --> 00:18:59,069
Since Sheriff Hutton ran off
in the middle of night,

132
00:18:59,103 --> 00:19:00,939
McCurdy and his boys
been getting bolder.

133
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:04,107
Forced Tim Fuller off his land.
Now they're threatening Peterson.

134
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:06,109
They come on my land,

135
00:19:06,143 --> 00:19:08,329
they'll be looking to the
wrong end of my 10 gauge.

136
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:10,515
Wait, Daniel. Wait.

137
00:19:10,548 --> 00:19:12,784
I've wired the U.S. Marshall.

138
00:19:12,817 --> 00:19:14,886
We will have the law
on our side.

139
00:19:14,918 --> 00:19:16,887
We're poor.

140
00:19:16,921 --> 00:19:20,225
When has the law ever
cared about folks like us?

141
00:19:22,659 --> 00:19:24,728
No one's comin'.

142
00:19:24,761 --> 00:19:27,131
Reverend.

143
00:19:35,906 --> 00:19:37,908
Whoa.

144
00:19:39,242 --> 00:19:41,480
Whoa.

145
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:51,823
Mary Alice.

146
00:19:51,856 --> 00:19:54,592
Heard people say in church
you were back.

147
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:56,594
Didn't believe it.

148
00:19:56,626 --> 00:19:59,897
Needed to come out
and see for myself.

149
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:04,536
I've been back a few days or so.

150
00:20:04,569 --> 00:20:08,039
A few days and you haven't
come and seen me?

151
00:20:09,573 --> 00:20:11,642
I planned on it, I just...

152
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,243
You always were
a terrible liar.

153
00:20:25,154 --> 00:20:27,755
I waited for this day.

154
00:20:27,791 --> 00:20:29,865
Thought about it.

155
00:20:29,899 --> 00:20:32,766
Planned what I might say.

156
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:37,934
Now I don't know
what to say.

157
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:46,049
You clearing all
this by yourself?

158
00:20:46,075 --> 00:20:48,717
Yes, ma'am.

159
00:20:49,789 --> 00:20:52,984
Lot of work for one man.

160
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:56,321
Shovel right over there
if you care to help.

161
00:21:02,659 --> 00:21:04,628
You look well.

162
00:21:04,662 --> 00:21:06,664
So do you.

163
00:21:06,696 --> 00:21:09,967
I swear you look the same
as the day I left.

164
00:21:10,001 --> 00:21:11,970
Now there you go
lying again.

165
00:21:12,002 --> 00:21:13,972
I don't recall you being

166
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:15,973
so distrustful of folks,
Mary Alice.

167
00:21:16,007 --> 00:21:18,142
I'd never lie to you.

168
00:21:18,175 --> 00:21:21,212
Well, I seem to recall you
saying something about

169
00:21:21,244 --> 00:21:24,782
coming back after the war.

170
00:21:33,323 --> 00:21:37,194
Well, I better let you
get back to your work.

171
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:41,965
Maybe after I get settled
we could ride out to the bluffs

172
00:21:41,999 --> 00:21:43,968
like we used to.

173
00:21:44,001 --> 00:21:46,304
That wouldn't be right.

174
00:21:48,271 --> 00:21:50,241
I'm married.

175
00:21:50,273 --> 00:21:52,242
Married?

176
00:21:52,276 --> 00:21:54,278
Going on eight years now.

177
00:21:54,310 --> 00:21:57,415
I have a little boy,
Charlie.

178
00:21:57,447 --> 00:22:00,717
I thought you knew.

179
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:05,123
No. No, I did not know that.

180
00:22:05,856 --> 00:22:07,825
I waited for you.

181
00:22:07,857 --> 00:22:11,095
But when the years passed
and there was no word and...

182
00:22:11,127 --> 00:22:14,299
Mary Alice, you do not
owe me an explanation.

183
00:22:21,238 --> 00:22:23,875
Who did you marry?

184
00:22:23,907 --> 00:22:27,177
Tom Watson.

185
00:22:33,117 --> 00:22:35,286
Tom's a good man.

186
00:22:35,319 --> 00:22:38,356
Yes, he is.

187
00:22:39,823 --> 00:22:42,292
Welcome home, John Henry.

188
00:22:58,209 --> 00:23:00,745
Shit!

189
00:23:42,853 --> 00:23:45,957
All right.
Bring 'em in, come on.

190
00:23:47,992 --> 00:23:50,127
What the... Dan!

191
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,098
We was just coming
to pay you a visit.

192
00:23:54,130 --> 00:23:57,234
Appreciate you
saving us a ride.

193
00:23:57,268 --> 00:24:01,506
I've got nothing
to say to you.

194
00:24:01,539 --> 00:24:04,275
Well,

195
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:06,478
I got something to say to you.

196
00:24:37,308 --> 00:24:39,343
That's enough.

197
00:24:39,376 --> 00:24:43,013
You don't wanna
kill him now, do ya?

198
00:24:43,047 --> 00:24:45,216
Well maybe I do. I...

199
00:24:45,249 --> 00:24:48,252
I hadn't decided yet.

200
00:24:48,586 --> 00:24:52,423
I'm taking him home.

201
00:24:52,455 --> 00:24:54,425
Hold on there now.

202
00:24:54,457 --> 00:24:56,527
It ain't you who's
doing the deciding.

203
00:24:58,261 --> 00:25:01,065
May I take him home?

204
00:25:01,098 --> 00:25:05,502
And what if I say no?
What you gonna do about it?

205
00:25:07,538 --> 00:25:09,507
Nothing.

206
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:12,376
I'm sorry. I didn't
quite hear that.

207
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:14,912
Nothing.

208
00:25:18,214 --> 00:25:21,117
All right, John Henry.

209
00:25:21,151 --> 00:25:25,390
You have my permission
to take him home.

210
00:25:50,414 --> 00:25:53,050
Something's troubling you?

211
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:04,662
Your mother and I kept
asking ourselves,

212
00:26:04,694 --> 00:26:08,665
asking God,

213
00:26:08,698 --> 00:26:11,869
what we done wrong
in your upbringing?

214
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:16,540
What did we do that filled you
with so much hate?

215
00:26:17,107 --> 00:26:20,511
It weren't you.

216
00:26:20,543 --> 00:26:24,514
John 8:32, remember?

217
00:26:24,548 --> 00:26:26,517
The truth will set you free.

218
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:28,519
God knows the truth.

219
00:26:28,551 --> 00:26:32,389
All through the war I kept
asking myself, where was God?

220
00:26:32,423 --> 00:26:34,992
Where was he at Shiloh
and Seven Pines

221
00:26:35,024 --> 00:26:36,993
when men lay dead and dying?

222
00:26:37,027 --> 00:26:40,097
All good men,
God-fearing men.

223
00:26:40,129 --> 00:26:43,533
They just lay there, begging
for some small act of mercy

224
00:26:43,567 --> 00:26:45,970
on His behalf.

225
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:50,573
And then it finally
dawned on me:

226
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:53,411
there ain't no God.

227
00:26:56,113 --> 00:26:58,015
There is no God?

228
00:26:58,048 --> 00:27:01,085
All I'm saying is that
if there was ever a time

229
00:27:01,117 --> 00:27:04,321
that man needed God it was then
and trust me, he wasn't there.

230
00:27:04,355 --> 00:27:06,524
If you're expecting God to
save you, he ain't gonna.

231
00:27:06,557 --> 00:27:09,260
Most men came out of that
war wanting nothing more

232
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:13,196
to do with killing,
but not you.

233
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,199
You went looking for it.

234
00:27:15,232 --> 00:27:17,535
God is not responsible
for the life you choose.

235
00:27:17,568 --> 00:27:19,971
I did not choose it!

236
00:27:52,603 --> 00:27:55,072
Get off my land.

237
00:27:55,105 --> 00:27:57,241
We just come to finish
the conversation

238
00:27:57,273 --> 00:27:59,643
that was interrupted, Dan.

239
00:28:07,350 --> 00:28:10,320
Let us avoid unpleasantness.

240
00:28:10,354 --> 00:28:15,760
Sir, I implore you
to see reason.

241
00:28:15,792 --> 00:28:21,232
If you take a fair grasp of your
situation, you will arrive

242
00:28:21,264 --> 00:28:24,267
at the only reasonable
conclusion available to you.

243
00:28:25,299 --> 00:28:26,337
I'm stayin'.

244
00:28:36,780 --> 00:28:40,317
Dirt and rock.

245
00:28:40,349 --> 00:28:45,555
Exactly like the dirt and the
rocks you would find anywhere.

246
00:28:45,588 --> 00:28:49,626
Yeah, but it's my dirt
and my rock!

247
00:28:49,659 --> 00:28:52,463
Yes, and a fine rock it is too.

248
00:28:52,495 --> 00:28:55,198
Is worth dying over?

249
00:28:55,232 --> 00:28:57,501
You believe your wife
would prefer the dirt

250
00:28:57,533 --> 00:29:00,503
and the rock to you?

251
00:29:00,537 --> 00:29:03,540
Will this keep her warm at night

252
00:29:03,573 --> 00:29:07,410
or put the food on the table?

253
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:10,780
Is it gonna teach your
children right from wrong?

254
00:29:10,813 --> 00:29:13,450
Comfort them in their beds

255
00:29:13,483 --> 00:29:17,855
when they're frightened
by the wind?

256
00:29:17,887 --> 00:29:20,491
You see, I do understand.

257
00:29:20,523 --> 00:29:23,694
I do understand. I truly do
understand the inequities

258
00:29:23,726 --> 00:29:25,829
of your position, sir,

259
00:29:25,863 --> 00:29:29,767
but I believe when you weigh
the alternatives,

260
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:33,070
you will see that...

261
00:29:37,707 --> 00:29:41,711
There was no need for that.

262
00:29:41,744 --> 00:29:45,648
We were talking.

263
00:29:45,682 --> 00:29:48,618
It would appear the
conversation's over now, Dave.

264
00:29:48,652 --> 00:29:50,621
He was about to see reason.

265
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:52,723
You actually ever kill
anybody, Dave,

266
00:29:52,755 --> 00:29:56,392
or you just talk 'em to death?

267
00:30:02,566 --> 00:30:06,703
Anybody else have
something to say?

268
00:30:15,244 --> 00:30:17,680
Daniel Peterson...

269
00:30:17,713 --> 00:30:21,851
is now safely
in the embrace of our Lord.

270
00:30:21,885 --> 00:30:28,692
But for us, here on earth,
a good man has been taken.

271
00:30:28,724 --> 00:30:34,430
A provider for his family,
a friend to our community,

272
00:30:34,463 --> 00:30:40,337
and in our despair,
we rail against God.

273
00:30:40,369 --> 00:30:46,242
Our faith is tested,
pushed to its very limits.

274
00:30:46,276 --> 00:30:50,447
But Almighty God has a purpose.

275
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,784
And senseless
though it may seem to us,

276
00:30:53,817 --> 00:31:00,191
it is not for mere mortal man
to question God's wisdom.

277
00:31:00,223 --> 00:31:03,694
It is for us to persevere
in a righteous way.

278
00:31:06,562 --> 00:31:08,398
-We gotta do something.
-Like what?

279
00:31:08,432 --> 00:31:09,950
I don't know.
We can't do nothing.

280
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,468
What about getting a sheriff?

281
00:31:11,501 --> 00:31:14,704
We tried. Most men ain't got the
stomach for a fight like this.

282
00:31:14,738 --> 00:31:17,775
We need a man who knows trouble,
a man who others fear.

283
00:31:17,808 --> 00:31:19,809
You suppose he might
come to our aid?

284
00:31:19,842 --> 00:31:21,878
Put that out of
your head right now.

285
00:31:21,912 --> 00:31:24,615
We could pay him. Took
a collection. We got $200.

286
00:31:24,647 --> 00:31:26,650
He's done with that life.

287
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:32,356
I can't believe James
would let it come to this.

288
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:34,357
They killed
Daniel Peterson.

289
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,526
I never thought
they'd kill one of us.

290
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:37,895
It's only gonna get worse.

291
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,230
What makes you say that?

292
00:31:39,262 --> 00:31:41,866
'Cause after the first one,
it gets easier.

293
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:50,273
You want something?
They heat up a good steak.

294
00:31:50,307 --> 00:31:53,644
No, thank you.

295
00:31:53,676 --> 00:31:56,012
Mrs. Peterson came in
and sold me her farm

296
00:31:56,046 --> 00:31:57,982
on the way out of town.

297
00:31:58,014 --> 00:32:00,650
Two other families
wanna sell also.

298
00:32:00,684 --> 00:32:04,254
What I'm saying is, it looks
like a more aggressive approach

299
00:32:04,288 --> 00:32:07,491
is having an effect
on the locals.

300
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:11,862
Clyde murdered that man.

301
00:32:11,895 --> 00:32:15,465
From what I heard, Peterson
was holding a shotgun.

302
00:32:15,499 --> 00:32:19,603
I did not come here to be
part of a pack of murderers.

303
00:32:19,636 --> 00:32:23,741
What the fuck did ya think was
gonna happen Dave? What?

304
00:32:23,773 --> 00:32:27,610
You think I brought you here to
sweet-talk folk off their land?

305
00:32:27,644 --> 00:32:29,980
Come on, Dave, please.

306
00:32:30,012 --> 00:32:32,949
I want Frank
to take care of things

307
00:32:32,982 --> 00:32:35,485
when it comes to the farms.

308
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:38,756
He seems to have to
temperament required.

309
00:32:38,789 --> 00:32:40,824
And me?

310
00:32:40,857 --> 00:32:43,359
I still want you here.

311
00:32:43,393 --> 00:32:45,896
I believe it's only
a matter of time

312
00:32:45,928 --> 00:32:50,400
before John Henry Clayton
picks up his guns.

313
00:32:55,938 --> 00:32:58,675
Hear we're riding to the
Chadwick farm tomorrow.

314
00:33:04,647 --> 00:33:07,384
Why don't you just
stand up on the bar

315
00:33:07,416 --> 00:33:10,353
and announce our intention
to all creation?

316
00:33:10,386 --> 00:33:14,658
Sorry, guess my enthusiasm
got the better of me.

317
00:33:33,443 --> 00:33:35,412
You planning to eat today?

318
00:33:35,444 --> 00:33:37,414
Ain't hungry.

319
00:33:37,446 --> 00:33:39,048
Need to eat.

320
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:40,650
Told you, I ain't hungry.

321
00:33:40,684 --> 00:33:43,721
You're trying to prove
something out here.

322
00:33:44,387 --> 00:33:46,357
I ain't trying to prove nothing.

323
00:33:46,389 --> 00:33:48,458
Yes, you are.

324
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:51,895
You're working this
land day in, day out.

325
00:33:51,927 --> 00:33:55,698
You're so weary, time night
comes, you can barely move.

326
00:33:55,732 --> 00:33:57,800
It's not for love of farming.

327
00:33:57,834 --> 00:34:00,104
I know why it is.

328
00:34:00,136 --> 00:34:02,473
You're trying to use
this poor earth

329
00:34:02,505 --> 00:34:05,007
to sweat out all
your guilt and anger.

330
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:07,010
That's what it is,
isn't it?

331
00:34:07,042 --> 00:34:08,611
No.

332
00:34:08,644 --> 00:34:11,881
Just because you don't believe
me, Pa, don't make it so.

333
00:34:11,914 --> 00:34:14,884
I told you I'm doing this
because Ma wanted it.

334
00:34:14,917 --> 00:34:18,821
What your mother wanted was for
you to come back from the war.

335
00:34:18,854 --> 00:34:21,157
What about you, Pa?

336
00:34:21,191 --> 00:34:23,627
Did you want me to come back?

337
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:26,497
Simple enough question.

338
00:34:26,530 --> 00:34:30,033
Do it even bother you that I
didn't come back after the war?

339
00:34:30,066 --> 00:34:32,035
What are you talking about?

340
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:35,004
I'm talking about the day
you turned your back on me,

341
00:34:35,037 --> 00:34:37,006
the day my brother,
William, died.

342
00:34:37,039 --> 00:34:38,641
That's not true.

343
00:34:38,675 --> 00:34:43,647
Ma saw it. Why the hell do you think she
wanted us to clear this field together?

344
00:34:43,680 --> 00:34:45,849
She tried to help us
put things right.

345
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,018
There was nothing to put right.

346
00:34:49,952 --> 00:34:53,656
I remember it as if
it was yesterday.

347
00:34:53,689 --> 00:34:56,526
Mr. Jenkins came across
William and I down river.

348
00:34:56,560 --> 00:34:59,096
Somehow he managed to drag
us out of there,

349
00:34:59,129 --> 00:35:01,098
get us up to his cabin.

350
00:35:01,131 --> 00:35:03,634
He told his boy
to go fetch you.

351
00:35:03,667 --> 00:35:06,636
I was so cold and scared
I couldn't stop shaking.

352
00:35:06,669 --> 00:35:09,572
When you arrived, I could hear
Mr. Jenkins trying to explain

353
00:35:09,606 --> 00:35:12,042
to you that one of your sons
had passed.

354
00:35:12,075 --> 00:35:15,044
Before you could get the
name out you rushed in

355
00:35:15,077 --> 00:35:17,046
and you saw me.

356
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,049
And I'll never forget it.

357
00:35:19,082 --> 00:35:22,051
The look of disappointment
on your face.

358
00:35:22,084 --> 00:35:24,954
How could you think
such a thing?

359
00:35:24,988 --> 00:35:27,223
Am I wrong?

360
00:35:27,256 --> 00:35:30,894
I didn't feel any
disappointment, far from it.

361
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:34,798
But I would be a liar

362
00:35:34,830 --> 00:35:38,734
if I said to you
I haven't felt it since.

363
00:35:38,767 --> 00:35:42,071
When word came back
about your exploits,

364
00:35:42,104 --> 00:35:44,675
I couldn't help but think

365
00:35:44,707 --> 00:35:48,546
William might've made
more of his life.

366
00:35:49,845 --> 00:35:52,682
Yeah.

367
00:36:40,696 --> 00:36:42,700
Chadwick!

368
00:36:57,647 --> 00:36:59,650
It's an ambush!

369
00:37:52,368 --> 00:37:54,905
How the hell they know
we was coming?

370
00:37:54,937 --> 00:37:56,906
Maybe they heard ya.

371
00:37:56,939 --> 00:38:00,109
That don't explain why there's
so many guns waiting for us.

372
00:38:00,142 --> 00:38:02,211
Just heard Chadwick
rode through the night

373
00:38:02,245 --> 00:38:04,781
and came back with his kin
from Landers.

374
00:38:04,814 --> 00:38:07,685
What would prompt him
to do such a thing?

375
00:38:21,964 --> 00:38:25,035
That one flapped his gum
so loud the other day

376
00:38:25,068 --> 00:38:28,671
someone must've heard and
warned 'em we was coming.

377
00:38:28,705 --> 00:38:30,941
Dan Thompson was a good man;

378
00:38:30,973 --> 00:38:33,910
died 'cause of that one's
foolishness.

379
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:40,883
Let him bleed out.

380
00:38:58,234 --> 00:39:00,771
How's the field coming?

381
00:39:01,271 --> 00:39:04,207
Almost all the trees are down.

382
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,444
Should start working
the land pretty soon.

383
00:39:07,477 --> 00:39:10,881
So I take it with all the
effort you're putting in

384
00:39:10,914 --> 00:39:13,283
that you're planning on staying.

385
00:39:14,484 --> 00:39:17,087
Not sure yet.

386
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:19,189
Why's that?

387
00:39:20,189 --> 00:39:22,958
Don't exactly know
where I fit it.

388
00:39:22,992 --> 00:39:25,095
This is your home.

389
00:39:25,127 --> 00:39:28,231
If a man can't fit in here,
where can he?

390
00:39:34,504 --> 00:39:37,074
You ever thought about
what it might've been

391
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:39,809
if you'd come back
after the war?

392
00:39:44,113 --> 00:39:47,184
So you never thought about it?

393
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:51,088
I ain't the same as the man
that left all them years back.

394
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:55,091
I need to understand
why you didn't come back.

395
00:39:55,124 --> 00:39:57,960
I think I'm entitled
to that much.

396
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:06,069
I'll say this,

397
00:40:06,102 --> 00:40:08,972
and I will say no more
on the subject.

398
00:40:09,004 --> 00:40:11,807
The thought of
coming back to you

399
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:15,444
was the only thing that got me
through that damn war.

400
00:40:15,477 --> 00:40:19,348
And when it was over,
I swear to you on my life,

401
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:22,819
I tried coming home.

402
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:26,723
I swore I was done with killing.

403
00:40:29,526 --> 00:40:32,863
She just wasn't done with me.

404
00:40:46,943 --> 00:40:49,412
You remember the day you left?

405
00:40:50,814 --> 00:40:54,151
I gave you a red ribbon
from my hair.

406
00:40:54,184 --> 00:40:58,388
Told you to hold onto it till
you could bring it back to me.

407
00:40:58,421 --> 00:41:00,924
Yes, I remember.

408
00:41:02,024 --> 00:41:04,293
You still have it?

409
00:41:04,327 --> 00:41:06,463
Does it matter?

410
00:41:06,495 --> 00:41:09,832
I'd like to know.

411
00:41:19,341 --> 00:41:22,479
You were right to
marry Tom, Mary Alice.

412
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:26,415
You were right.

413
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:46,035
You wanted to see me?

414
00:41:47,303 --> 00:41:49,573
I set you a simple task.

415
00:41:49,606 --> 00:41:52,943
You wanna explain to me
how you took that task

416
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:55,511
and fucked it up
in every conceivable way?

417
00:41:57,146 --> 00:41:59,883
Well I think
everything's all right.

418
00:41:59,915 --> 00:42:01,885
Everything's all right.

419
00:42:01,917 --> 00:42:04,988
You got two men dead...
One by your own hand...

420
00:42:05,021 --> 00:42:07,022
Chadwick's still on his land,

421
00:42:07,055 --> 00:42:11,461
and I may not be as clever as
you, but to my way of thinking

422
00:42:11,493 --> 00:42:15,131
no way that adds up
to all right.

423
00:42:15,164 --> 00:42:17,334
If these things aren't
dealt with quickly,

424
00:42:17,367 --> 00:42:19,502
it could give
the others ideas.

425
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:22,539
The last thing we need
is these muddle heads

426
00:42:22,571 --> 00:42:25,209
thinking they can
stand up to us.

427
00:42:38,588 --> 00:42:41,658
Regret marrying me?

428
00:42:41,691 --> 00:42:45,294
What kind of question is that?

429
00:42:45,327 --> 00:42:48,530
I seen John Henry here
earlier today.

430
00:42:48,564 --> 00:42:51,167
So?

431
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:55,338
So, I know how you
felt about him.

432
00:42:55,370 --> 00:42:59,242
That was a long time ago.

433
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:12,655
You're my husband, Tom.

434
00:43:12,689 --> 00:43:16,460
I have no regrets.

435
00:44:51,787 --> 00:44:53,739
I'm sorry for your loss.

436
00:44:53,740 --> 00:44:55,691
No, you ain't.

437
00:44:56,591 --> 00:44:58,727
Eventually...

438
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:02,097
someone's gonna have the nerve
to stand up to you.

439
00:45:02,131 --> 00:45:04,768
And when that day comes,

440
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:09,006
I want to be here
to spit on your grave.

441
00:45:10,372 --> 00:45:14,810
Well, ma'am,
feel free to do so.

442
00:45:14,843 --> 00:45:20,282
Provided you can find your way
to the front of the line.

443
00:45:22,818 --> 00:45:25,654
20 pounds of seed, salt.

444
00:45:25,687 --> 00:45:27,423
I'll settle the account.

445
00:45:27,424 --> 00:45:29,158
All right, Reverend.

446
00:45:29,191 --> 00:45:34,030
In a bit of a hurry. You don't
mind if I cut in here, do ya?

447
00:45:36,466 --> 00:45:39,602
Gimme a box of .44 skins

448
00:45:39,635 --> 00:45:42,671
and a bottle of
that tonic water.

449
00:45:42,705 --> 00:45:45,042
I got me a headache.

450
00:45:56,318 --> 00:45:58,254
You done?

451
00:45:59,622 --> 00:46:02,359
I look like I'm done?

452
00:46:06,194 --> 00:46:08,164
Look what you made me do.

453
00:46:08,196 --> 00:46:10,300
I'll just,
clean that up.

454
00:46:10,332 --> 00:46:12,334
No, no, it's all right.

455
00:46:12,368 --> 00:46:15,405
John Henry'll get it.

456
00:46:15,437 --> 00:46:19,142
Won't you, John Henry?

457
00:46:27,216 --> 00:46:29,185
Yeah, get it all.

458
00:46:29,218 --> 00:46:31,221
Don't miss that spot
over there.

459
00:46:32,722 --> 00:46:35,624
And you got
some on my boot.

460
00:46:54,644 --> 00:46:58,482
You know, I don't care for
the way you're looking at me.

461
00:47:09,325 --> 00:47:12,462
You know what your
problem is, John Henry?

462
00:47:12,495 --> 00:47:14,830
You wanna act like a pilgrim,

463
00:47:14,863 --> 00:47:19,502
but you still got the attitude
of a killer.

464
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:29,679
I'll come back later,
Mr. Parsons.

465
00:47:31,580 --> 00:47:33,582
Where do ya think
you're going?

466
00:47:33,615 --> 00:47:35,584
Get out of my way.

467
00:47:35,618 --> 00:47:38,421
Ya see? There ya go,
being rude again.

468
00:47:38,453 --> 00:47:40,756
No!

469
00:47:49,698 --> 00:47:52,334
Not so smart, are you now,
gunslinger?

470
00:47:58,374 --> 00:48:00,443
No!

471
00:48:06,582 --> 00:48:08,551
Somebody help us.

472
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:11,187
Hey, hey, come on now.
We're just funnin'.

473
00:48:24,867 --> 00:48:27,437
Come on, Ned, hit him again.

474
00:48:32,508 --> 00:48:34,810
Come on, John Henry, get up.

475
00:48:37,513 --> 00:48:39,950
John Henry, stay down.

476
00:49:11,414 --> 00:49:13,783
Somebody help! Please!

477
00:49:13,816 --> 00:49:15,984
It's John Henry.

478
00:49:16,017 --> 00:49:17,303
Where you going?

479
00:49:17,304 --> 00:49:18,588
He needs help.

480
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:20,589
Well, others will help him.

481
00:49:20,622 --> 00:49:22,624
He's my friend.

482
00:49:22,658 --> 00:49:25,828
I said get back here, woman!

483
00:50:21,015 --> 00:50:23,485
Welcome, gentleman.

484
00:50:23,519 --> 00:50:26,656
Why don't you get
the gentlemen some drinks?

485
00:50:39,935 --> 00:50:43,840
You must be really thirsty
to be drinking in my place.

486
00:50:43,872 --> 00:50:46,475
Let me be.

487
00:50:47,609 --> 00:50:51,012
I heard about what
happened on the street.

488
00:50:51,046 --> 00:50:55,051
Seems women get bolder
every year, don't they?

489
00:50:55,084 --> 00:50:58,553
I believe I have a proposal

490
00:50:58,586 --> 00:51:01,156
which might be of benefit
to both of us.

491
00:51:01,189 --> 00:51:03,959
Now the last thing I want
is to interfere

492
00:51:03,993 --> 00:51:06,396
in a man's marital affairs,

493
00:51:06,428 --> 00:51:10,031
but it appears that
a change in locale for you

494
00:51:10,064 --> 00:51:13,802
might be a solution
for both of us.

495
00:51:17,705 --> 00:51:20,742
When you got a fox
in the henhouse,

496
00:51:20,776 --> 00:51:23,546
only two things to do:

497
00:51:23,578 --> 00:51:28,151
kill the fox or
move the henhouse.

498
00:51:28,184 --> 00:51:34,055
Sell the land, take
the money, move away.

499
00:51:34,089 --> 00:51:39,696
Far, far from here
and John Henry Clayton.

500
00:51:48,102 --> 00:51:50,439
Done.

501
00:52:04,687 --> 00:52:06,790
My.

502
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:10,827
How are you feeling?

503
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:14,164
I wish people would
stop asking me that.

504
00:52:15,631 --> 00:52:18,568
It's only natural
for friends to inquire.

505
00:52:19,834 --> 00:52:22,472
Is that what we are, Dave?

506
00:52:22,504 --> 00:52:24,973
Friends?

507
00:52:25,006 --> 00:52:27,809
I'd like to think so.

508
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:32,080
Do you think there's a place

509
00:52:32,113 --> 00:52:36,485
for men like us to go,
get away from the killing?

510
00:52:36,519 --> 00:52:39,856
My experience would
lead me to say no.

511
00:52:43,792 --> 00:52:48,231
After the war I swore to myself
I'd never pick up a gun again.

512
00:52:48,263 --> 00:52:50,932
You can't go through
something like that

513
00:52:50,966 --> 00:52:53,669
and expect to be who you were.

514
00:52:53,702 --> 00:52:55,805
I suppose.

515
00:52:55,838 --> 00:52:59,242
May I ask, what was
the worst of it for ya?

516
00:53:00,843 --> 00:53:04,013
Without a doubt, Shiloh.

517
00:53:04,046 --> 00:53:07,216
I would concur.

518
00:53:07,249 --> 00:53:11,287
That first day at Owl Creek
I lost a lot of good friends.

519
00:53:11,319 --> 00:53:14,589
I was there at Owl Creek.

520
00:53:14,622 --> 00:53:18,528
I do not recall
seeing you there.

521
00:53:19,894 --> 00:53:23,231
I was on the other
side of the creek.

522
00:53:23,265 --> 00:53:26,102
Well.

523
00:53:27,236 --> 00:53:29,805
It would appear the past

524
00:53:29,838 --> 00:53:32,908
is close to repeating
itself with us.

525
00:53:32,941 --> 00:53:37,746
I feel you and I are headed
for an inevitable conclusion.

526
00:53:37,780 --> 00:53:40,749
I got no fight with you, Dave.

527
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:45,254
Besides, if I was looking for
trouble, you'd already know it.

528
00:53:45,287 --> 00:53:47,622
How so?

529
00:53:47,656 --> 00:53:49,725
'Cause I'd have gone into town

530
00:53:49,758 --> 00:53:52,896
and I'd have killed Frank
and that big fella.

531
00:53:55,196 --> 00:53:58,600
I do admire your restraint,
John Henry. I do.

532
00:53:58,633 --> 00:54:01,202
God knows I could not turn
the other cheek

533
00:54:01,236 --> 00:54:03,239
the way that you have.

534
00:54:03,272 --> 00:54:06,809
But I also know if you
kick a dog long enough,

535
00:54:06,841 --> 00:54:09,011
he's gonna bite.

536
00:54:10,144 --> 00:54:13,648
So whatever it is that's
given you the strength

537
00:54:13,682 --> 00:54:18,221
to stay out of this,
I pray you hold on to it.

538
00:54:19,254 --> 00:54:22,992
I don't wanna see you on
the other side of that creek.

539
00:55:31,292 --> 00:55:34,997
The Lord is my light
and my salvation.

540
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:36,999
Whom should I fear?

541
00:55:37,031 --> 00:55:39,834
The Lord is the
strength of my life.

542
00:55:39,868 --> 00:55:42,738
Of whom shall I be afraid?

543
00:55:42,771 --> 00:55:47,142
Teach me thy way, Lord.

544
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:51,714
Lead me in a smooth path
because of my enemies.

545
00:55:51,747 --> 00:55:56,886
Do not deliver me to the will
of my adversaries.

546
00:55:56,919 --> 00:56:01,357
And such as breathe
out violence.

547
00:56:17,939 --> 00:56:22,410
I would have lost heart
if I had not believed

548
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:26,381
that I would see the goodness
of the Lord

549
00:56:26,414 --> 00:56:30,218
in the land of the living.

550
00:56:30,252 --> 00:56:33,222
Wait for the Lord.

551
00:56:33,254 --> 00:56:38,760
Be of good courage and
he shall strengthen your heart.

552
00:56:38,794 --> 00:56:42,998
Wait, I say, on the Lord.

553
00:56:43,031 --> 00:56:45,034
Amen.

554
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:53,058
Hey there.

555
00:56:53,059 --> 00:56:54,276
Hey.

556
00:56:54,309 --> 00:56:57,113
It's good to see you
finding your way back.

557
00:56:57,146 --> 00:56:59,115
Thank you.

558
00:56:59,147 --> 00:57:01,216
We're leaving now!

559
00:57:01,249 --> 00:57:03,318
You stay away from her.

560
00:57:04,252 --> 00:57:06,254
What are you saying, Tom?

561
00:57:06,287 --> 00:57:08,925
You don't think I see
what's going on?

562
00:57:10,124 --> 00:57:12,093
What's going on?

563
00:57:12,127 --> 00:57:14,096
Tom.

564
00:57:14,129 --> 00:57:16,098
Stay out of this, Reverend.

565
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:19,368
Look at all of us?

566
00:57:19,401 --> 00:57:22,238
He comes back here
after all these years

567
00:57:22,271 --> 00:57:26,508
and we welcome him home
with smiles and open arms.

568
00:57:26,542 --> 00:57:28,978
Why?

569
00:57:29,010 --> 00:57:31,780
I'll tell you why.

570
00:57:31,814 --> 00:57:34,350
'Cause we're all afraid of him

571
00:57:34,383 --> 00:57:38,187
and the things he's done
and things he might do.

572
00:57:39,287 --> 00:57:42,992
You think you can walk back
in here after all these years

573
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:46,394
and just pick up
where you left off?

574
00:57:46,428 --> 00:57:49,866
I understand what you're
thinking, Tom, but you're wrong.

575
00:57:50,566 --> 00:57:53,269
Then tell me you
don't love her.

576
00:57:53,301 --> 00:57:55,271
Go on.

577
00:57:55,303 --> 00:57:58,973
I want you to tell me in
front of God, your father,

578
00:57:59,006 --> 00:58:02,010
and everyone here
that you don't love her.

579
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:04,413
Say it!

580
00:58:06,448 --> 00:58:09,185
Tell me you don't love her!

581
00:58:38,146 --> 00:58:40,582
You're wrong about him, Tom.

582
00:58:57,265 --> 00:58:59,601
Mr. McCurdy, I need
to talk to you.

583
00:58:59,635 --> 00:59:02,638
The papers will be ready
for you to sign Tuesday.

584
00:59:02,671 --> 00:59:05,207
No, I've decided
not to sell to you.

585
00:59:05,240 --> 00:59:07,977
Something funny?

586
00:59:08,010 --> 00:59:11,479
I'm amused at how many times
my ears play tricks on me.

587
00:59:11,513 --> 00:59:14,950
For a moment I thought
I heard you say you wish

588
00:59:14,982 --> 00:59:17,252
to extricate yourself from
the agreement we made.

589
00:59:17,285 --> 00:59:19,621
Of course, I know you
couldn't've said that.

590
00:59:19,655 --> 00:59:21,624
I did say that.

591
00:59:21,656 --> 00:59:22,925
See, I been thinking my...

592
00:59:22,926 --> 00:59:24,193
Shut up!

593
00:59:28,296 --> 00:59:31,532
Before you open your yap again,
I want you to consider

594
00:59:31,566 --> 00:59:34,336
the full ramifications
of your fucking actions.

595
00:59:34,368 --> 00:59:37,006
We had a deal.

596
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:39,073
I didn't sign nothing.

597
00:59:39,106 --> 00:59:41,142
Words were spoke.
Hands were shook.

598
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:43,279
Well, I've had a
change of heart.

599
00:59:43,312 --> 00:59:46,281
Come to realize that a new
start don't mean much

600
00:59:46,314 --> 00:59:48,383
if you carrying old
feelings with you.

601
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:50,519
Well, that's very
fucking deep, Tom.

602
00:59:50,551 --> 00:59:52,553
Almost poetic.

603
00:59:52,586 --> 00:59:57,126
And as I wipe a weepy tear
from my eye let me say this:

604
00:59:57,158 --> 01:00:00,528
I'm not one who holds high
principles, but when a man

605
01:00:00,562 --> 01:00:03,699
shakes my hand and says
he's gonna do something,

606
01:00:03,731 --> 01:00:06,534
I expect him
to follow through.

607
01:00:06,568 --> 01:00:10,372
Now you be here before
the end of business Tuesday

608
01:00:10,405 --> 01:00:12,675
and sign those papers.

609
01:00:12,707 --> 01:00:15,243
And bid this town
a fond farewell

610
01:00:15,276 --> 01:00:19,347
or suffer the fucking
consequences.

611
01:01:01,490 --> 01:01:04,059
Well, I ain't gonna just
sit here pretending

612
01:01:04,091 --> 01:01:07,729
that you and I have ever
seen eye to eye on, well...

613
01:01:07,763 --> 01:01:09,999
pretty much anything.

614
01:01:11,499 --> 01:01:14,302
Reason I ain't coming here
begging for forgiveness

615
01:01:14,336 --> 01:01:17,071
is because I don't think
I deserve it.

616
01:01:17,104 --> 01:01:20,742
But I would be mighty grateful
if you could make my purpose

617
01:01:20,776 --> 01:01:22,979
a little more clear to me.

618
01:01:50,571 --> 01:01:54,142
Before I came home,
I was just drifting.

619
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:58,414
Town to town.

620
01:01:58,446 --> 01:02:00,782
Ended up in a small
place called Norton,

621
01:02:00,816 --> 01:02:03,586
way over in Kansas.

622
01:02:04,185 --> 01:02:08,323
Been riding hard, went in
the saloon for a drink.

623
01:02:08,356 --> 01:02:11,325
Two men come up on me
looking for a fight,

624
01:02:11,359 --> 01:02:13,629
so I gave it to 'em.

625
01:02:14,229 --> 01:02:17,698
Cut one of 'em up pretty bad,
outdrew on the other.

626
01:02:17,731 --> 01:02:21,169
Told him to pick up
his partner and get.

627
01:02:24,439 --> 01:02:28,109
All I had to do
was leave that town.

628
01:02:29,310 --> 01:02:31,747
But I didn't.

629
01:02:31,780 --> 01:02:34,050
I waited.

630
01:02:34,381 --> 01:02:38,252
Daring 'em to come after me.

631
01:02:38,285 --> 01:02:42,790
And sure enough,
when I walked outside

632
01:02:42,823 --> 01:02:46,761
those two young men
started firing on me.

633
01:02:46,794 --> 01:02:51,332
Shot out my horse. I drew
my pistol. I fired back.

634
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:55,437
I killed them.
I killed them both.

635
01:02:57,405 --> 01:03:01,310
In the middle of all of it
one of my shots went wide,

636
01:03:01,343 --> 01:03:03,511
straight through
a storefront window.

637
01:03:06,214 --> 01:03:08,817
Woman came out screaming,

638
01:03:08,850 --> 01:03:11,720
covered in blood.

639
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:15,356
First I thought I'd shot her.

640
01:03:18,325 --> 01:03:20,829
Then her husband come out...

641
01:03:24,198 --> 01:03:26,601
carrying a little boy.

642
01:03:29,604 --> 01:03:32,274
I killed a boy, Pop.

643
01:03:33,374 --> 01:03:35,743
He looked to be
the same age as William.

644
01:03:35,776 --> 01:03:38,579
He just lay there dead
'cause of what I'd done.

645
01:03:38,613 --> 01:03:40,582
Just like William did.

646
01:03:40,615 --> 01:03:42,584
William didn't die
because of you.

647
01:03:42,617 --> 01:03:44,653
You're not responsible
for your brother's death.

648
01:03:44,685 --> 01:03:47,890
You told me not to take him
down to the river.

649
01:03:47,923 --> 01:03:51,593
I told both of you. You were
boys doing what boys do.

650
01:03:51,626 --> 01:03:53,896
It was an accident.
Tragic, but an accident.

651
01:03:53,928 --> 01:03:56,197
I often think about
what my brother

652
01:03:56,231 --> 01:03:57,933
would've grown up to be.

653
01:03:57,966 --> 01:04:00,801
Now I can't stop thinking
about what that little boy

654
01:04:00,834 --> 01:04:02,838
from Norton would've
grown up to be.

655
01:04:03,537 --> 01:04:06,507
The only thing I know
that's true in my heart

656
01:04:06,540 --> 01:04:09,644
is that both of those boys
would've grown up to be

657
01:04:09,678 --> 01:04:11,680
a far cry better than me.

658
01:04:12,948 --> 01:04:16,585
Pa, I'm so sorry
for what I've become.

659
01:04:35,403 --> 01:04:37,506
Charlie, Charlie.

660
01:04:37,738 --> 01:04:40,608
Go on, stay inside.

661
01:04:40,642 --> 01:04:43,412
Might I have a word
with you, ma'am?

662
01:04:44,578 --> 01:04:47,548
We have no business that
I know of, Mr. McCurdy.

663
01:04:47,582 --> 01:04:49,685
That you know of.

664
01:04:49,718 --> 01:04:53,288
Your husband and I have spoken
about him selling his farm.

665
01:04:53,321 --> 01:04:55,324
Well, I'd be surprised

666
01:04:55,356 --> 01:04:57,358
if my husband entertained
such an idea.

667
01:04:57,392 --> 01:04:59,361
Well, ma'am, if that
surprises you,

668
01:04:59,394 --> 01:05:01,430
you'll be dumbstruck to learn

669
01:05:01,463 --> 01:05:03,832
he's agreed to the sale
of the property.

670
01:05:03,865 --> 01:05:05,968
I don't believe you.

671
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:08,437
Well, that's of little
concern to me,

672
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:11,540
being as he's the title holder.

673
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,609
I want you off my land.

674
01:05:14,642 --> 01:05:19,380
And you have every right
to do so for another...

675
01:05:19,414 --> 01:05:22,751
32 hours and 18 minutes.

676
01:05:22,783 --> 01:05:24,919
And if we're still here?

677
01:05:24,952 --> 01:05:28,489
Then I'd start looking
for a black dress.

678
01:05:29,423 --> 01:05:31,426
Let's go.

679
01:05:41,368 --> 01:05:43,771
Whoa.

680
01:05:53,682 --> 01:05:56,017
McCurdy wants our land.

681
01:05:56,051 --> 01:05:58,720
You should be speaking
with your husband.

682
01:05:58,752 --> 01:06:01,323
I'm speaking to you.

683
01:06:01,356 --> 01:06:05,627
Tom made a deal with McCurdy
and now he's changed his mind.

684
01:06:06,060 --> 01:06:09,765
Mary Alice, you need to go home
and speak with your husband.

685
01:06:09,798 --> 01:06:11,767
He's gonna get himself killed.

686
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:14,635
I don't want that for my boy.

687
01:06:14,669 --> 01:06:17,004
You know why he's doing this.

688
01:06:17,037 --> 01:06:19,874
To prove that he's
as good as you are.

689
01:06:21,910 --> 01:06:24,046
Mary Alice,
I've seen this before

690
01:06:24,078 --> 01:06:26,048
and it only ends one way.

691
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,517
You wanna save your family?

692
01:06:28,550 --> 01:06:31,053
You take what McCurdy's
offering and you move away.

693
01:06:31,086 --> 01:06:33,821
You understand me?
You move away.

694
01:06:45,066 --> 01:06:47,401
Excuse me, Mr. McCurdy?

695
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:50,105
Reverend's here.
He wants a word with you.

696
01:06:50,138 --> 01:06:52,674
Did he say what it's about?

697
01:06:52,707 --> 01:06:54,676
Tom Watson.

698
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:57,379
I should've known.
Show him in.

699
01:07:04,051 --> 01:07:07,055
You're to leave the
Watsons alone, James.

700
01:07:07,088 --> 01:07:09,658
You sure do have a
repetitive nature, Samuel.

701
01:07:09,691 --> 01:07:11,660
I mean it.

702
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:14,930
Mean what? What are you
gonna do if I don't?

703
01:07:14,963 --> 01:07:18,466
Command the Lord to strike me
dead with a lightning bolt?

704
01:07:19,868 --> 01:07:22,604
We were friends.

705
01:07:22,636 --> 01:07:24,772
I'm asking you,

706
01:07:24,805 --> 01:07:28,476
stop doing what you're doing
to Tom Watson.

707
01:07:28,510 --> 01:07:32,080
Tom Watson shook my hand
and agreed to a deal.

708
01:07:32,113 --> 01:07:34,082
He's not going to leave.

709
01:07:34,115 --> 01:07:36,084
He will.

710
01:07:36,117 --> 01:07:40,022
One way or another, he will.

711
01:08:29,704 --> 01:08:31,807
You did what?

712
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:33,909
No!

713
01:08:33,941 --> 01:08:36,043
What are you...

714
01:08:36,077 --> 01:08:40,716
what are you
shaking your head at?

715
01:08:42,917 --> 01:08:46,087
A damn fool, Frank.

716
01:08:46,119 --> 01:08:48,222
You did the one thing

717
01:08:48,256 --> 01:08:51,059
that will bring John Henry
Clayton into this.

718
01:09:06,607 --> 01:09:07,792
Pa!

719
01:09:07,793 --> 01:09:08,976
In the back.

720
01:09:12,713 --> 01:09:14,682
How is he?

721
01:09:14,716 --> 01:09:17,084
I don't know yet.

722
01:09:17,118 --> 01:09:19,120
Pa.

723
01:09:36,137 --> 01:09:38,140
John Henry.

724
01:09:40,975 --> 01:09:42,944
How is he?

725
01:09:42,976 --> 01:09:45,046
Well, the blade missed
any vital organs,

726
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:47,849
but he did lose a fair
amount of blood.

727
01:09:47,882 --> 01:09:50,118
We'll know more
in the morning.

728
01:09:50,150 --> 01:09:51,435
I wanna see him.

729
01:09:51,436 --> 01:09:52,720
He's not conscious.

730
01:09:52,753 --> 01:09:55,723
I just wanna sit with him.

731
01:10:16,177 --> 01:10:19,114
Don't you even think
of leaving me, old man.

732
01:10:19,146 --> 01:10:21,149
Not now.

733
01:10:21,181 --> 01:10:24,652
Not after everything
we've come through.

734
01:10:56,950 --> 01:10:58,919
I'll get the doc.

735
01:10:58,953 --> 01:11:01,923
No. Listen to me, son.

736
01:11:01,955 --> 01:11:04,793
I have to tell you something.

737
01:11:06,628 --> 01:11:09,064
I was wrong.

738
01:11:09,096 --> 01:11:14,134
I was wrong about you,
and I was wrong about me.

739
01:11:14,168 --> 01:11:18,205
That big fella, I would've
killed him if I could've.

740
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:21,009
I would've killed
all of them.

741
01:11:21,042 --> 01:11:24,346
You and me,

742
01:11:24,378 --> 01:11:28,149
we are the same blood.

743
01:11:35,256 --> 01:11:37,359
I'm filled with fear,
John Henry.

744
01:11:37,391 --> 01:11:39,360
You're gonna be fine, Pop.

745
01:11:39,394 --> 01:11:42,030
No, no, not for me.

746
01:11:42,062 --> 01:11:46,133
I'm fearful I'm gonna lose you.
I can see what's in your eyes.

747
01:11:50,805 --> 01:11:53,173
Then you know what I gotta do.

748
01:11:53,207 --> 01:11:56,410
You don't have to do anything.

749
01:11:56,444 --> 01:12:00,147
But we both know I will.

750
01:12:03,016 --> 01:12:04,985
I'll get the doc.

751
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:08,256
John Henry Clayton, you stop.

752
01:12:10,958 --> 01:12:13,795
John Henry, please.

753
01:12:19,367 --> 01:12:21,735
Please...

754
01:12:21,769 --> 01:12:24,405
for me...

755
01:12:24,439 --> 01:12:26,408
don't.

756
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:29,243
This ain't gonna end, Pa,
till someone ends it.

757
01:12:29,276 --> 01:12:33,213
Not you. It doesn't
have to be you.

758
01:12:33,247 --> 01:12:36,450
It's time I did something
right in my life.

759
01:12:36,484 --> 01:12:40,321
This is what I know how to do.

760
01:13:37,311 --> 01:13:40,182
Mr. Parsons, in that a LeMat?

761
01:13:40,480 --> 01:13:42,449
Yes, sir.

762
01:13:42,482 --> 01:13:45,753
I bought it off a fella
about a month ago.

763
01:13:48,422 --> 01:13:51,259
She's a real beauty, ain't she?

764
01:13:51,292 --> 01:13:54,796
Nine shots in a 10 gauge
shotgun barrel.

765
01:13:54,829 --> 01:13:59,868
And I can let you have
it for a fair price.

766
01:13:59,900 --> 01:14:03,971
Or you can just borrow it.

767
01:15:23,484 --> 01:15:26,521
I suspect you're the one
they call Little Ned?

768
01:15:33,127 --> 01:15:35,096
That's right.

769
01:15:48,642 --> 01:15:52,046
All you young 'uns who ain't
willing to die today,

770
01:15:52,079 --> 01:15:54,182
I suggest you unarm yourselves
and get.

771
01:15:54,214 --> 01:15:56,618
Stay where you are, boys.

772
01:16:07,093 --> 01:16:09,497
Goddamn you.

773
01:17:14,595 --> 01:17:16,564
Fuck!

774
01:18:25,132 --> 01:18:27,635
Mouth getting dry, Frank?

775
01:18:27,668 --> 01:18:31,006
You offering to buy me a drink?

776
01:19:21,721 --> 01:19:24,124
John Henry.

777
01:19:34,568 --> 01:19:37,738
Whatever happens next,
I want you to know

778
01:19:37,770 --> 01:19:41,575
I did not sanction that cowardly
act against your father.

779
01:19:41,609 --> 01:19:43,811
Personally, I found their
actions damnable

780
01:19:43,843 --> 01:19:46,713
and deserving of the fate
you brought upon them.

781
01:19:46,747 --> 01:19:48,816
Then you'll be leaving?

782
01:19:48,848 --> 01:19:51,252
Can't do that.

783
01:19:51,284 --> 01:19:55,155
No one hires a gunman
who runs from trouble.

784
01:19:55,189 --> 01:19:59,093
You don't have to run, Dave.
You can walk.

785
01:20:01,227 --> 01:20:05,100
The terms of my employment
would not allow me to do that.

786
01:20:26,253 --> 01:20:30,258
This here LeMat's mighty heavy.
Puts me at a disadvantage.

787
01:20:31,257 --> 01:20:33,226
What would you suggest?

788
01:20:33,260 --> 01:20:36,564
Would you be kind enough
to let me go back inside

789
01:20:36,596 --> 01:20:38,665
and retrieve myself a Colt?

790
01:20:50,744 --> 01:20:53,181
Thank you.

791
01:22:28,641 --> 01:22:31,578
My friend,
you are no longer employed.

792
01:22:42,021 --> 01:22:44,891
It would appear you are correct.

793
01:22:54,534 --> 01:22:57,437
It's been a pleasure
knowing you, Dave.

794
01:23:34,007 --> 01:23:36,444
I'm all right, Pa.

795
01:23:36,744 --> 01:23:40,714
It's not gonna take long for word to
get out on what happened here today.

796
01:23:40,748 --> 01:23:43,571
Men from far and wide
are gonna come looking

797
01:23:43,572 --> 01:23:45,453
for me to make a
name for themselves.

798
01:23:45,485 --> 01:23:48,988
Don't go away. I can't
finish the field on my own.

799
01:23:49,021 --> 01:23:51,958
The field's finished, Pa.
I seeded it.

800
01:23:51,992 --> 01:23:54,829
It'll take care of itself.

801
01:23:54,861 --> 01:23:57,131
I gotta go.

802
01:23:57,163 --> 01:23:59,999
You're not going for
another 10 years, are you?

803
01:24:00,033 --> 01:24:02,770
No, I promise.

804
01:24:02,802 --> 01:24:04,905
See you soon, Pa.

805
01:24:25,859 --> 01:24:28,495
<i>Little is known
of him after that.</i>

806
01:24:28,529 --> 01:24:30,765
<i>Some say he drifted down
to Coffeeville</i>

807
01:24:30,797 --> 01:24:34,001
<i>where he was involved
in another altercation</i>

808
01:24:34,034 --> 01:24:36,437
<i>a few years later.</i>

809
01:24:36,470 --> 01:24:39,740
<i>But those accusations
were never proven.</i>

810
01:24:39,772 --> 01:24:42,743
<i>The common view was
he moved westward</i>

811
01:24:42,775 --> 01:24:44,744
<i>under a different name,</i>

812
01:24:44,778 --> 01:24:48,716
<i>where he lived a life
of quiet isolation.</i>

813
01:24:52,785 --> 01:24:55,756
<i>What is known is that
when Mary Alice died</i>

814
01:24:55,788 --> 01:24:59,659
<i>a few years later, he did not
attend her funeral.</i>

815
01:24:59,693 --> 01:25:03,530
<i>However, many say
the following day,</i>

816
01:25:03,564 --> 01:25:08,535
<i>a faded red ribbon was found
attached to her headstone.</i>

817
01:25:16,642 --> 01:25:19,180
<i>Others in Fowler recounted
stories of seeing him</i>

818
01:25:19,212 --> 01:25:23,650
<i>throughout the years
up until his father's death,</i>

819
01:25:23,684 --> 01:25:27,555
<i>at which time
he came no more.</i>
