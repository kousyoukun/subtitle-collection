Synchronization: ShooCat

2
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:25,373
Watch this shot now.
Shoot, man. Go.

3
00:08:07,957 --> 00:08:09,375
Yeah.

4
00:10:06,701 --> 00:10:08,870
Hey, chickie.
Chick, chick, chick.

5
00:10:08,911 --> 00:10:11,164
Watch it, Jet boy.
Hey, Jet boy.

6
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,280
Beat it!

7
00:10:59,087 --> 00:11:01,005
Jets, get out here.

8
00:11:17,105 --> 00:11:18,231
Come on.

9
00:11:27,323 --> 00:11:29,117
Beat it.

10
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:43,006
Okay, here we go.

11
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,501
Jets! Hey, Jets!

12
00:12:51,157 --> 00:12:52,575
Hey, Jets!

13
00:13:02,752 --> 00:13:05,129
Jets, come on!

14
00:13:11,803 --> 00:13:13,805
Jets, come on.

15
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:26,609
Come on, boys, huh?

16
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:29,737
Hey, come on, huh?

17
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:52,946
Break it up, you punks.

18
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:55,990
Cut it out. Come on,
let's break it up, l said.

19
00:14:56,032 --> 00:14:58,159
Come on. Break it up.

20
00:14:58,242 --> 00:15:00,870
How many times have l told you punks
to cut this stuff out?

21
00:15:00,954 --> 00:15:03,039
Why, if it ain't
Lieutenant Schrank.

22
00:15:03,122 --> 00:15:06,542
- Top o' the day, Lieutenant Schrank.
- And Officer Krupke.

23
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:08,670
Top o' the day,
Officer Krupke.

24
00:15:08,753 --> 00:15:11,798
- l'll give you the top o' the head.
- Hey, you, get down.

25
00:15:11,881 --> 00:15:14,592
- But we're havin' such fun.
- We enjoy the playground.

26
00:15:14,676 --> 00:15:17,720
See, it keeps us deprived children
off of the foul city streets.

27
00:15:17,804 --> 00:15:20,473
- Shut up.
- Born like we was on the hot pavements.

28
00:15:20,515 --> 00:15:22,934
- You wanna get your skull broke?
- Baby John, come here.

29
00:15:29,816 --> 00:15:30,984
All right.

30
00:15:31,067 --> 00:15:34,237
Now, which one of
these Puerto Ricans bloodied you?

31
00:15:35,446 --> 00:15:37,991
- Well, sir--
- Which one?

32
00:15:38,074 --> 00:15:39,617
Excuse me, sir.

33
00:15:39,701 --> 00:15:42,620
As a matter of fact,
we suspicion...

34
00:15:42,704 --> 00:15:45,665
- that the job was done by a cop.
- Two cops.

35
00:15:45,748 --> 00:15:47,709
- At the very least.
- lmpossible.

36
00:15:47,792 --> 00:15:50,837
ln America,
nothing is impossible.

37
00:15:51,754 --> 00:15:53,923
All right, wise guys.

38
00:15:54,007 --> 00:15:55,508
You listen to me...

39
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:57,594
all of ya.

40
00:15:57,594 --> 00:16:00,054
You hoodlums
don't own these streets...

41
00:16:00,138 --> 00:16:02,932
and l've had all the roughhouse
l'm gonna put up with around here.

42
00:16:03,016 --> 00:16:05,810
You wanna kill each other?
Kill each other.

43
00:16:05,893 --> 00:16:07,979
But you ain't gonna do it
on my beat.

44
00:16:08,062 --> 00:16:10,148
- Are there any questions?
- Yes, sir.

45
00:16:10,231 --> 00:16:13,443
Would you mind
translating that into Spanish?

46
00:16:15,653 --> 00:16:19,449
Get your friends
out of here, Bernardo...

47
00:16:19,532 --> 00:16:21,451
and stay out.

48
00:16:26,706 --> 00:16:28,583
Please.

49
00:16:30,293 --> 00:16:32,211
Okay, Sharks.

50
00:16:44,015 --> 00:16:48,227
Boy, oh, boy, as if this neighborhood
wasn't crummy enough.

51
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:53,149
Now, look, fellas.
Fellas?

52
00:16:53,232 --> 00:16:55,151
Look, let's be reasonable.

53
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:57,904
lf l don't get a little
law and order around here...

54
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:00,490
l get busted down
to a traffic corner...

55
00:17:00,573 --> 00:17:02,742
and your friend
don't like traffic corners.

56
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:07,080
So that means you're gonna start
makin' nice with the P.R.s from now on.

57
00:17:08,373 --> 00:17:10,583
l said nice, get it?

58
00:17:11,668 --> 00:17:13,461
'Cause if you don't...

59
00:17:13,544 --> 00:17:17,674
and l catch any of you doin'
any more brawlin' in my territory...

60
00:17:17,715 --> 00:17:20,176
l'm gonna personally beat the living
crud out of every one of you...

61
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:23,972
and see that you go to the can
and rot there.

62
00:17:26,182 --> 00:17:28,685
Say good-bye
to the nice boys, Krupke.

63
00:17:28,726 --> 00:17:30,687
Good-bye, boys.

64
00:17:37,318 --> 00:17:39,988
Jail? Gee.

65
00:17:40,029 --> 00:17:42,949
- You hoodlums don't own the streets.
- Go play in the park.

66
00:17:43,032 --> 00:17:45,118
- Keep off of the grass.
- Get out of the house.

67
00:17:45,201 --> 00:17:47,954
- Keep off the block.
- Keep off the world.

68
00:17:48,037 --> 00:17:49,956
A gang that don't own the street
is nothin'.

69
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,292
- That's it.
- We do own it!

70
00:17:53,793 --> 00:17:55,503
Jets, round out.

71
00:17:55,587 --> 00:17:57,714
Not you, Anybodys.
Beat it.

72
00:17:57,755 --> 00:17:59,716
Riff, you gotta
let me in the gang.

73
00:17:59,757 --> 00:18:01,926
Didn't you just see me?
l was smash.

74
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:03,928
l'm a killer.
l wanna fight.

75
00:18:04,012 --> 00:18:06,014
How else is she gonna
get a guy to touch her?

76
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:09,559
- You dirty rat!
- The road, little girl, the road.

77
00:18:09,642 --> 00:18:10,935
Beat it.

78
00:18:14,022 --> 00:18:16,774
Okay, come on.

79
00:18:21,446 --> 00:18:23,197
Now listen.

80
00:18:23,281 --> 00:18:26,367
We fought hard for this turf,
and we ain't just gonna give it up.

81
00:18:26,451 --> 00:18:28,745
The Emeralds claimed it,
and we shut 'em out.

82
00:18:28,828 --> 00:18:31,414
The Hawks tried to take it away,
and we knocked 'em down the cellar.

83
00:18:31,497 --> 00:18:33,458
- Yeah, but these P.R.s are different.
- They multiply.

84
00:18:33,499 --> 00:18:35,460
- They keep comin'.
- Like cockroaches.

85
00:18:35,501 --> 00:18:37,712
- They're eatin' all the food.
- They're breathin' all the air.

86
00:18:37,754 --> 00:18:39,672
Help! l'm drowning in tamale.

87
00:18:39,756 --> 00:18:41,674
You heard what
Lieutenant Schrank said.

88
00:18:41,758 --> 00:18:45,553
We gotta make nice
with them Puerto Ricans, or else.

89
00:18:45,637 --> 00:18:49,807
Are we gonna let 'em move in
and take it all away from us, or else?

90
00:18:49,891 --> 00:18:52,352
You're damn right no.

91
00:18:52,393 --> 00:18:54,354
What are we gonna do,
huh, buddy boys?

92
00:18:54,395 --> 00:18:58,066
l'll tell you what we're gonna do.
We're gonna speed fast.

93
00:18:58,149 --> 00:19:00,151
We're gonna move like lightnin'...

94
00:19:00,193 --> 00:19:02,946
and we're gonna clean
them Sharks up once and for all...

95
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:06,324
so they ain't never gonna set foot
on our turf again.

96
00:19:06,407 --> 00:19:10,370
And we're gonna do it
in one all-out fight.

97
00:19:10,453 --> 00:19:13,748
- A rumble!
- Now, cool, Action boy.

98
00:19:13,831 --> 00:19:16,542
The Sharks want a piece
of this world too.

99
00:19:16,626 --> 00:19:18,920
They're real down boys.

100
00:19:19,003 --> 00:19:22,257
They might ask for blades,
zip guns.

101
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:25,385
Zip guns? Well, gee.

102
00:19:25,468 --> 00:19:28,513
l ain't finalizin' and sayin'
they will, Baby John.

103
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:31,140
l'm just sayin' that they might.

104
00:19:31,224 --> 00:19:34,227
And we gotta be prepared.

105
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:36,229
Now, what's your mood, Jets?

106
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:38,022
l say go, go!

107
00:19:38,064 --> 00:19:39,774
- l say mix.
- l say sock 'em.

108
00:19:39,857 --> 00:19:41,317
- Tear 'em.
- Yeah.

109
00:19:41,401 --> 00:19:44,904
- But if they say blades or guns?
- l say let's forget the whole thing.

110
00:19:44,988 --> 00:19:47,198
- What?
- What do you say, Riff?

111
00:19:48,366 --> 00:19:50,702
l say this turf is small...

112
00:19:50,785 --> 00:19:53,538
but it's all we got, huh?

113
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:56,749
l want to hold it like
we always held it-- with skin.

114
00:19:58,668 --> 00:20:01,754
But if they say blades,
l say blades.

115
00:20:01,838 --> 00:20:05,216
lf they say guns,
l say guns.

116
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,219
l say l want the Jets
to be the number one...

117
00:20:08,261 --> 00:20:10,263
to sail, to hold the sky!

118
00:20:10,346 --> 00:20:12,265
Then rev us off!

119
00:20:14,392 --> 00:20:16,311
Okay, cats, we rumble.

120
00:20:17,854 --> 00:20:20,773
Protocality calls for a war council
between us and the Sharks...

121
00:20:20,857 --> 00:20:22,358
to set the whole thing up.

122
00:20:22,442 --> 00:20:25,069
l will personally give
the bad news to Bernardo.

123
00:20:25,153 --> 00:20:27,071
- You gotta take a lieutenant with you.
- That's me.

124
00:20:27,113 --> 00:20:29,115
- That's Tony.
- Who needs Tony?

125
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:33,077
We need Tony. He's got a rep
that's bigger than the whole west side.

126
00:20:33,161 --> 00:20:36,998
- He don't belong no more.
- Now, cut it, Action.

127
00:20:37,081 --> 00:20:40,001
- Me and Tony started the Jets.
- So where is he?

128
00:20:40,084 --> 00:20:42,378
How come he takes
a lousy, stinkin' job?

129
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:44,964
- Youth board corrupted him.
- Yeah, temporary sickness.

130
00:20:45,048 --> 00:20:48,176
-Wait and see.
-Man, the day we clobbered the Emeralds.

131
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:51,304
- He saved my ever-lovin' neck.
- Sure, he'll do it again too.

132
00:20:51,387 --> 00:20:54,474
He always came through for us,
and he always will.

133
00:20:54,557 --> 00:20:57,310
When you're a Jet
you're a Jet all the way

134
00:20:57,352 --> 00:21:01,064
From your first cigarette
to your last dying day

135
00:21:01,147 --> 00:21:03,775
When you're a Jet
let them do what they can

136
00:21:03,858 --> 00:21:07,403
You've got brothers around
You're a family man

137
00:21:07,487 --> 00:21:09,030
You're never alone

138
00:21:09,072 --> 00:21:11,574
You're never disconnected

139
00:21:11,616 --> 00:21:14,702
You're home with your own
When company's expected

140
00:21:14,786 --> 00:21:16,829
You're well protected

141
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:19,457
Then you are set
with a capital "J"

142
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:22,669
Which you'll never forget
till they cart you away

143
00:21:22,752 --> 00:21:25,630
When you're a Jet
you stay

144
00:21:25,672 --> 00:21:28,591
A Jet

145
00:21:31,511 --> 00:21:33,137
l know Tony like l know me.

146
00:21:33,221 --> 00:21:36,182
- l guarantee you can count him in.
- ln, out. Let's get crackin'.

147
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:39,143
- Where you gonna find Bernardo?
- lt ain't safe to go in P.R. territory.

148
00:21:39,185 --> 00:21:42,146
- He'll be at the dance at the gym.
- But the gym's neutral territory.

149
00:21:42,188 --> 00:21:45,316
A-rab, l'm gonna make nice with 'em.
l'm only gonna challenge 'em.

150
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,318
- Great, Daddy-O.
- So listen.

151
00:21:47,402 --> 00:21:51,322
Everybody dress up sweet and sharp.
Meet Tony and me at the dance at 10:00.

152
00:21:51,406 --> 00:21:53,366
- And walk tall.
- We always walk tall.

153
00:21:53,449 --> 00:21:55,201
- We're Jets.
- The greatest.

154
00:21:56,244 --> 00:21:58,830
When you're a Jet
you're the top cat in town

155
00:21:58,871 --> 00:22:02,333
You're the gold-medal kid
with the heavyweight crown

156
00:22:02,417 --> 00:22:05,253
When you're a Jet
you're the swingingest thing

157
00:22:05,336 --> 00:22:08,673
Little boy, you're a man
Little man, you're a king

158
00:22:08,715 --> 00:22:12,927
The Jets are in gear
Our cylinders are clickin'

159
00:22:12,969 --> 00:22:14,679
The Sharks'll steer clear

160
00:22:14,762 --> 00:22:17,974
'Cause every Puerto Rican's
a lousy chicken

161
00:22:18,016 --> 00:22:20,476
Here come the Jets
like a bat out of hell

162
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,980
Someone gets in our way
someone don't feel so well

163
00:22:24,063 --> 00:22:26,816
Here come the Jets
Little world, step aside

164
00:22:26,899 --> 00:22:29,986
Better go underground
Better run, better hide

165
00:22:30,069 --> 00:22:34,073
We're drawin' the line
so keep your noses hidden

166
00:22:34,157 --> 00:22:37,035
We're hangin' a sign
says "Visitors Forbidden"

167
00:22:37,118 --> 00:22:38,703
And we ain't kiddin'

168
00:22:38,786 --> 00:22:41,331
Here come the Jets, yeah
and we're gonna beat

169
00:22:41,414 --> 00:22:44,667
Every last buggin' gang
on the whole buggin' street

170
00:22:44,751 --> 00:22:46,753
On the whole buggin'

171
00:22:46,836 --> 00:22:51,799
Ever-lovin' street

172
00:22:53,801 --> 00:22:54,886
Yeah!

173
00:22:55,011 --> 00:22:58,264
- Tony, you're not even listenin'.
- l read you loud and clear, Riff.

174
00:22:58,348 --> 00:22:59,891
Then why don't you say somethin'?

175
00:22:59,974 --> 00:23:03,061
l don't want to hurt your feelings.
You're my buddy, my pal, my best friend.

176
00:23:03,144 --> 00:23:05,730
Womb to tomb?

177
00:23:05,813 --> 00:23:07,273
Birth to earth.

178
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:11,110
That's why you gotta come to the dance
tonight and stand up with me.

179
00:23:11,194 --> 00:23:13,696
Come on, Tony, just say yes.

180
00:23:15,406 --> 00:23:19,577
Did you ever stop to figure how many
bubbles there are in one bottle of soda?

181
00:23:19,661 --> 00:23:21,704
Tony, this is important.

182
00:23:21,788 --> 00:23:24,040
Everything's important, Riff.

183
00:23:24,123 --> 00:23:26,793
You, me,
the sweet guy l work for.

184
00:23:26,876 --> 00:23:29,629
The Sharks walk bad.
They bite hard.

185
00:23:29,712 --> 00:23:32,006
lf we don't stop 'em now,
we're gonna never--

186
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:35,468
- Work for a living.
- How do you like that, huh?

187
00:23:35,510 --> 00:23:37,637
Four-and-a-half years l live
with a buddy and his family.

188
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:41,015
l think l'm diggin'
a guy's character.

189
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:44,060
Boy, am l a victim
of disappointment in you.

190
00:23:45,019 --> 00:23:46,938
End your sufferin', little man.

191
00:23:47,021 --> 00:23:49,691
Why don't you just pack up your gear
and move out?

192
00:23:49,774 --> 00:23:52,068
'Cause your ma's hot for me.

193
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,616
lt's 'cause l hate livin'
with my buggin' uncle.

194
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,202
- Come on!
- Uncle! Uncle!

195
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:06,457
Go play games with the Jets.

196
00:24:06,541 --> 00:24:08,501
Why not?
They're the greatest.

197
00:24:08,585 --> 00:24:10,420
Ain't they?

198
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:11,879
Were.

199
00:24:14,048 --> 00:24:16,134
You found somethin' better?

200
00:24:17,427 --> 00:24:19,554
Not yet, but--

201
00:24:19,637 --> 00:24:21,389
But what?

202
00:24:22,473 --> 00:24:24,809
You won't dig it, Riff.

203
00:24:24,892 --> 00:24:27,353
So try me.

204
00:24:27,395 --> 00:24:29,564
Come on, Tony. Try me.

205
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,027
Okay.

206
00:24:37,405 --> 00:24:39,991
Every single night
for the last month...

207
00:24:40,033 --> 00:24:43,620
l wake up,
and l'm reachin' out.

208
00:24:44,746 --> 00:24:46,706
Well, for what?

209
00:24:46,748 --> 00:24:48,708
l don't know.

210
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:49,876
A dame?

211
00:24:51,085 --> 00:24:54,297
lt's right outside the door,
just around the corner...

212
00:24:54,339 --> 00:24:56,007
but it's comin'.

213
00:24:56,090 --> 00:24:58,092
What is?

214
00:24:58,176 --> 00:25:00,136
l don't know.

215
00:25:01,262 --> 00:25:03,222
lt's like the kick l used to get
from bein' a Jet.

216
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:05,475
Well, now you're talkin'.

217
00:25:05,558 --> 00:25:07,894
Man, without a gang,
you're an orphan.

218
00:25:07,977 --> 00:25:10,563
With a gang, you walk
in twos, threes, fours.

219
00:25:10,647 --> 00:25:13,191
When your crew is the best,
when you're a Jet...

220
00:25:13,274 --> 00:25:15,944
you're out in the sun, buddy boy,
you're home, free home.

221
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:17,946
Riff, l've had it.

222
00:25:24,118 --> 00:25:26,537
Tony, look at me, will ya?
Come on, look at me.

223
00:25:26,621 --> 00:25:28,331
l'm lookin' at you.

224
00:25:28,414 --> 00:25:32,210
l never asked the time of day
from a clock, did l?

225
00:25:32,293 --> 00:25:34,254
l never asked nothin' from nobody.

226
00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:37,966
But l'm askin' you,
come to the dance tonight.

227
00:25:39,425 --> 00:25:41,344
l promised Doc l'd clean up
the store tonight.

228
00:25:41,427 --> 00:25:44,138
Then do it after the dance.

229
00:25:44,222 --> 00:25:47,600
Tony, l already told the guys
you'd be there.

230
00:25:47,642 --> 00:25:50,436
lf you don't show,
l'll be marked lousy.

231
00:25:51,854 --> 00:25:55,233
- What time did you tell 'em?
- 10:00.

232
00:25:55,275 --> 00:25:57,777
For me, Tony. For Riff.

233
00:26:01,155 --> 00:26:03,116
- 10:00 it is.
- Womb to tomb?

234
00:26:03,157 --> 00:26:05,034
Birth to earth,
and l'll live to regret this.

235
00:26:05,118 --> 00:26:08,997
Who knows? Maybe what you're waitin' for
will be twitchin' at the dance tonight.

236
00:26:09,038 --> 00:26:10,999
Who knows?

237
00:26:20,216 --> 00:26:23,386
Could be

238
00:26:23,428 --> 00:26:26,598
Who knows

239
00:26:26,681 --> 00:26:30,184
There's something due any day
l will know right away

240
00:26:30,268 --> 00:26:33,521
Soon as it shows

241
00:26:33,605 --> 00:26:36,357
lt may come cannonballin' down
through the sky, gleam in its eye

242
00:26:36,399 --> 00:26:39,819
Bright as a rose

243
00:26:39,861 --> 00:26:43,031
Who knows

244
00:26:43,114 --> 00:26:46,701
lt's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach

245
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:49,996
Under a tree

246
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:52,707
l got a feelin' there's a miracle due
gonna come true

247
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:56,878
Comin' to me

248
00:26:58,463 --> 00:27:00,924
Could it be
Yes, it could

249
00:27:00,965 --> 00:27:03,426
Something's comin'
something good

250
00:27:03,468 --> 00:27:05,970
lf l can wait

251
00:27:06,012 --> 00:27:09,182
Something's comin'
l don't know what it is

252
00:27:09,265 --> 00:27:13,269
But it is gonna be great

253
00:27:13,353 --> 00:27:15,939
With a click
with a shock

254
00:27:16,022 --> 00:27:18,524
Phone will jingle
door will knock

255
00:27:18,608 --> 00:27:20,860
Open the latch

256
00:27:20,944 --> 00:27:24,238
Something's comin'
Don't know when, but it's soon

257
00:27:24,322 --> 00:27:28,117
Catch the moon
One-handed catch

258
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:33,289
Around the corner

259
00:27:33,373 --> 00:27:38,628
Or whistlin' down the river

260
00:27:38,711 --> 00:27:43,716
Come on, deliver

261
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:49,347
To me

262
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,058
Will it be
Yes, it will

263
00:27:52,141 --> 00:27:54,727
Maybe just by holdin' still

264
00:27:54,811 --> 00:27:57,272
lt'll be there

265
00:27:57,313 --> 00:28:00,566
Come on, somethin'
Come on in, don't be shy

266
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,612
Meet a guy
Pull up a chair

267
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:09,826
The air is hummin'

268
00:28:09,867 --> 00:28:12,745
And somethin' great

269
00:28:12,787 --> 00:28:14,747
ls comin'

270
00:28:19,419 --> 00:28:23,006
lt's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach

271
00:28:23,089 --> 00:28:26,259
Maybe tonight

272
00:28:43,693 --> 00:28:45,987
Por favor, Anita.
You are my friend.

273
00:28:46,029 --> 00:28:48,448
- Stop it, Maria.
- You must make the neck lower.

274
00:28:48,531 --> 00:28:52,452
You must stop heckling me. We are
working on our time, not the old lady's.

275
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,873
One inch. How much
can one little inch do?

276
00:28:56,956 --> 00:28:58,583
Too much.

277
00:28:58,666 --> 00:29:02,545
Anita, it is now to be a dress
for dancing, no longer for praying.

278
00:29:02,629 --> 00:29:07,634
Listen, with those boys, you can
start out dancing and end up praying.

279
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:11,262
One little inch.

280
00:29:11,346 --> 00:29:14,390
Bernardo made me promise.

281
00:29:14,474 --> 00:29:17,852
One month have l been in this country.
Do l ever even touch excitement?

282
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:20,688
l sew in this place all day.
l sit at home all night.

283
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:22,523
For what did my brother
bring me here?

284
00:29:23,524 --> 00:29:25,068
To marry Chino.

285
00:29:26,194 --> 00:29:28,112
When l look at Chino,
nothing happens.

286
00:29:28,196 --> 00:29:30,657
What do you expect to happen?

287
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:33,368
l don't know. Something.

288
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:37,163
What happens when you
look at Bernardo?

289
00:29:38,331 --> 00:29:41,459
lt's when l don't look
that it happens.

290
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:47,006
l think l will tell
Mama and Papa...

291
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:50,385
about you and Nardo
in the balcony of the movies.

292
00:29:50,468 --> 00:29:53,221
- l will rip this to shreds!
- No.

293
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:56,224
But if you could perhaps manage
to lower the neck.

294
00:29:57,850 --> 00:29:59,978
Next year.

295
00:30:00,061 --> 00:30:02,438
- l hate that dress!
- Then don't wear it.

296
00:30:02,522 --> 00:30:04,607
Don't come to the dance
with us tonight.

297
00:30:04,691 --> 00:30:06,651
Don't come?

298
00:30:09,404 --> 00:30:13,032
- Could we not dye it red, at least?
- No, we could not.

299
00:30:15,285 --> 00:30:17,662
White is for babies.

300
00:30:17,745 --> 00:30:21,249
l will be the only one there
in a white--

301
00:30:32,885 --> 00:30:35,221
lt is a beautiful dress.

302
00:30:35,305 --> 00:30:37,599
l love you!

303
00:30:38,808 --> 00:30:41,019
- Are you ready, ladies?
- Nardo, come in.

304
00:30:41,102 --> 00:30:43,605
ls it not beautiful?

305
00:30:43,688 --> 00:30:46,149
Yes. Very.

306
00:30:46,232 --> 00:30:48,693
l didn't quite hear.

307
00:30:48,776 --> 00:30:50,695
Very beautiful.

308
00:30:52,155 --> 00:30:54,365
Come in, Chino.
Do not be afraid.

309
00:30:54,449 --> 00:30:55,909
But this is a shop for ladies.

310
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:59,913
We won't bite you
till we know you better.

311
00:30:59,954 --> 00:31:03,124
You will keep both eyes on Maria
tonight in case l cannot.

312
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,877
- You too, Anita.
- My brother is a silly watchdog.

313
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:08,755
My sister is a precious jewel.

314
00:31:10,048 --> 00:31:12,342
What am l, cut glass?

315
00:31:13,843 --> 00:31:18,806
Nardo, it is most important that l have
a wonderful time at the dance tonight.

316
00:31:18,973 --> 00:31:19,641
lt is?

317
00:31:19,724 --> 00:31:22,352
Because tonight is
the real beginning of my life...

318
00:31:22,435 --> 00:31:25,021
as a young lady of America.

319
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:31,170
Get out of here.

320
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:08,708
Come on, guys.

321
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:15,715
- Hey, look what l got.
- Hi, Consuelo.

322
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:18,176
Maria, these are some of my friends
you have not met.

323
00:33:18,259 --> 00:33:21,262
- Hey, pick up.
- How are you?

324
00:33:21,304 --> 00:33:23,681
This is Loco.

325
00:33:23,723 --> 00:33:25,433
Teresita.

326
00:33:25,516 --> 00:33:26,851
- My sister Maria.
- Good evening.

327
00:33:26,935 --> 00:33:29,312
And this is Luis Arruza.

328
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:30,813
Rosalia, hi.

329
00:33:41,241 --> 00:33:44,744
All right, boys and girls.

330
00:33:44,786 --> 00:33:46,704
Attention, please.

331
00:33:53,127 --> 00:33:55,922
- Come here.
- Okay, let's get on with it.

332
00:33:56,005 --> 00:33:58,841
My, this is a fine turnout
we have here tonight.

333
00:33:58,925 --> 00:34:01,052
Hey, it's all for you, Glad Hand.

334
00:34:02,553 --> 00:34:05,098
l know all of you
boys and girls are here...

335
00:34:05,181 --> 00:34:07,350
because you want to
make new friends...

336
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:10,478
and get closer to old ones.

337
00:34:12,272 --> 00:34:13,773
So tonight...

338
00:34:13,856 --> 00:34:16,943
kids, we're gonna do
something special.

339
00:34:17,026 --> 00:34:19,529
We're gonna have
a get-together dance.

340
00:34:19,612 --> 00:34:21,531
Ginger-peachy!

341
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:25,868
All right. Now, kids.

342
00:34:25,952 --> 00:34:28,621
l want you to form two circles.

343
00:34:28,663 --> 00:34:31,332
- How many?
- Two. Boys on the outside.

344
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:34,377
- Girls on the inside.
- Hey, where are you?

345
00:34:36,754 --> 00:34:38,172
All right.

346
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:42,552
When the music stops...

347
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:46,556
each boy dances with
whichever girl is opposite.

348
00:34:46,598 --> 00:34:47,724
Okay?

349
00:34:49,767 --> 00:34:51,686
Two circles, kids.

350
00:34:56,024 --> 00:34:58,026
Well, it won't hurt you to try.

351
00:34:58,067 --> 00:35:00,945
Ooh, it hurts, it hurts.

352
00:35:01,029 --> 00:35:02,488
Snowboy.

353
00:35:46,574 --> 00:35:49,535
That's it, kids.
Keep the ball rolling.

354
00:35:49,619 --> 00:35:52,497
Around she goes,
and where she stops...

355
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:54,666
nobody knows.

356
00:35:54,749 --> 00:35:56,626
Here we go.

357
00:35:58,586 --> 00:36:01,673
Boys to my right,
and girls to my left.

358
00:36:32,370 --> 00:36:33,997
- Mambo!
- Mambo!

359
00:36:34,080 --> 00:36:35,832
Go!

360
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:35,863
You're not thinkin'
l'm someone else?

361
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:38,866
l know you are not.

362
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:44,247
Or that we met before?

363
00:40:45,915 --> 00:40:47,917
l know we have not.

364
00:40:49,085 --> 00:40:51,337
l felt...

365
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,506
l knew something never before
was going to happen...

366
00:40:53,548 --> 00:40:55,550
had to happen,
but this is so much more.

367
00:40:55,633 --> 00:40:57,594
My hands are cold.

368
00:41:02,348 --> 00:41:04,267
Yours too.

369
00:41:11,316 --> 00:41:12,775
So warm.

370
00:41:18,531 --> 00:41:21,409
So beautiful.

371
00:41:21,492 --> 00:41:22,911
Beautiful.

372
00:41:29,792 --> 00:41:31,961
lt's so much to believe.

373
00:41:33,379 --> 00:41:34,797
You're not makin' a joke.

374
00:41:37,216 --> 00:41:40,178
l have not yet learned
how to joke that way.

375
00:41:41,387 --> 00:41:44,015
l think now l never will.

376
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:21,135
Get your hands off, American!

377
00:42:21,177 --> 00:42:23,012
- Stay away from my sister.
- Sister?

378
00:42:23,096 --> 00:42:25,473
- Couldn't you see he's one of them?
- No, l saw only him.

379
00:42:25,515 --> 00:42:27,600
There's only one thing they want
from a Puerto Rican girl.

380
00:42:27,684 --> 00:42:29,477
- That's a lie.
- Later, Tony.

381
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,812
Don't listen to them.

382
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:32,814
She will listen to her brother
before she listens to you.

383
00:42:32,897 --> 00:42:35,233
- lf you two want to settle this--
- Please, boys!

384
00:42:35,316 --> 00:42:39,195
Everything was going so well.
We're all here to have a good time.

385
00:42:39,279 --> 00:42:42,156
Come here a second.
l want to talk to you.

386
00:42:46,869 --> 00:42:49,247
Take her out of here.
We're going home.

387
00:42:49,289 --> 00:42:52,834
- lt is my first dance.
- Please, we are family. Now, go.

388
00:43:03,928 --> 00:43:05,847
Come, Maria.

389
00:43:18,443 --> 00:43:21,613
- l don't want you.
- l want you though.

390
00:43:31,164 --> 00:43:33,875
l want you for a war council.
Jets and Sharks.

391
00:43:34,918 --> 00:43:37,962
- The pleasure is mine.
- Let's go outside.

392
00:43:38,046 --> 00:43:41,007
l would not leave the ladies alone
with your kind around.

393
00:43:41,090 --> 00:43:43,885
We will meet you at midnight.

394
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:46,304
- Doc's candy store?
- Mm-hmm.

395
00:43:46,387 --> 00:43:47,931
And no jazz before then.

396
00:43:49,015 --> 00:43:51,601
l understand the rules...

397
00:43:51,684 --> 00:43:52,852
native boy.

398
00:43:54,729 --> 00:43:56,147
lce.

399
00:44:01,069 --> 00:44:02,987
Doc's at midnight.
Spread the word.

400
00:44:03,071 --> 00:44:04,530
Right, Daddy-O.

401
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:22,423
The most beautiful sound
l ever heard

402
00:44:22,507 --> 00:44:24,550
Maria

403
00:44:30,515 --> 00:44:33,351
All the beautiful sounds
of the world

404
00:44:33,434 --> 00:44:36,688
ln a single word

405
00:44:47,198 --> 00:44:51,369
l just met a girl named Maria

406
00:44:51,452 --> 00:44:53,621
And suddenly that name

407
00:44:53,705 --> 00:44:57,709
Will never be the same to me

408
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:03,840
l just kissed a girl
named Maria

409
00:45:03,881 --> 00:45:06,134
And suddenly l found

410
00:45:06,175 --> 00:45:09,929
How wonderful a sound can be

411
00:45:12,223 --> 00:45:17,687
Say it loud
and there's music playing

412
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:19,772
Say it soft

413
00:45:19,856 --> 00:45:23,776
And it's almost like praying

414
00:45:26,487 --> 00:45:29,157
l'll never stop saying

415
00:45:56,643 --> 00:46:01,522
Say it loud
and there's music playing

416
00:46:01,606 --> 00:46:03,691
Say it soft

417
00:46:03,775 --> 00:46:07,820
And it's almost like praying

418
00:46:10,657 --> 00:46:13,618
l'll never stop saying

419
00:46:25,296 --> 00:46:28,049
The most beautiful sound

420
00:46:28,132 --> 00:46:32,262
l ever heard

421
00:46:48,945 --> 00:46:51,656
Now, l do not say these things
to spoil your evening...

422
00:46:51,698 --> 00:46:53,366
or to hear myself talk.

423
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:55,577
l am here longer than you.

424
00:46:55,618 --> 00:46:58,621
Someday when you are an old
married woman with five children...

425
00:46:58,705 --> 00:47:02,542
then you can tell me what to do,
but now it is the other way around.

426
00:47:02,584 --> 00:47:04,877
Now go to bed.

427
00:47:04,961 --> 00:47:07,255
He's the old married woman.

428
00:47:13,094 --> 00:47:16,014
You know, she has a mother,
also a father.

429
00:47:16,055 --> 00:47:18,224
They do not know this country
any better than she does.

430
00:47:18,308 --> 00:47:19,892
You do not know it at all.

431
00:47:19,976 --> 00:47:24,063
Girls here are free to have fun.
She is in America now.

432
00:47:24,147 --> 00:47:26,900
Puerto Rico is in America now.

433
00:47:30,028 --> 00:47:32,196
Sometimes l don't know
which is thicker--

434
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,741
your skull or your accent.

435
00:47:40,788 --> 00:47:42,957
- Let them wait.
- ls Maria all right?

436
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,835
- l should be so all right.
- lt will not happen again.

437
00:47:45,919 --> 00:47:47,587
Pepe, lndio.

438
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:50,840
- After tonight, things will be settled.
- First settle your stomach.

439
00:47:50,924 --> 00:47:52,175
Never mind my stomach.

440
00:47:52,216 --> 00:47:55,929
Well, l mind your nose
and your head broken.

441
00:47:56,012 --> 00:47:57,680
- Broken?
- Sure.

442
00:47:57,764 --> 00:48:00,141
They use Maria for an excuse
to start World War lll.

443
00:48:00,183 --> 00:48:01,601
lt is more than that.

444
00:48:01,684 --> 00:48:04,312
More than what?
She was only dancing.

445
00:48:04,395 --> 00:48:07,315
With an American
who is really a Polack.

446
00:48:07,398 --> 00:48:08,983
Says the spic.

447
00:48:11,110 --> 00:48:12,737
You are not so cute.

448
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:15,281
- That Tony is.
- And he works.

449
00:48:15,365 --> 00:48:16,699
A delivery boy.

450
00:48:16,783 --> 00:48:18,868
- And what are you?
- An assistant.

451
00:48:18,952 --> 00:48:22,121
And Chino makes half
of what the Polack makes.

452
00:48:22,205 --> 00:48:24,249
- The Polack is an American.
- Here comes the whole commercial.

453
00:48:24,332 --> 00:48:26,542
Your mother's a Pole.
Your father's a Swede.

454
00:48:26,626 --> 00:48:28,836
But you were born here.
That's all that you need.

455
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,506
You are an American.
But us?

456
00:48:31,547 --> 00:48:32,882
Foreigners!

457
00:48:32,966 --> 00:48:35,551
Lice. Cockroaches.

458
00:48:35,635 --> 00:48:36,803
But it's true.

459
00:48:36,886 --> 00:48:40,306
When l think about how l thought
it would be for us here.

460
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:42,809
We came like children,
believing, trusting.

461
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:44,477
With our hearts open.

462
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:46,437
With our arms open.

463
00:48:46,479 --> 00:48:49,983
You came with your mouth open.

464
00:48:50,066 --> 00:48:52,026
You did, spic, and you'll
go back in handcuffs.

465
00:48:52,068 --> 00:48:54,070
l'm going back in a Cadillac.

466
00:48:54,153 --> 00:48:55,822
- Air-conditioned.
- Built-in bar.

467
00:48:55,905 --> 00:48:57,615
- Telephone.
- Television.

468
00:48:57,699 --> 00:48:59,200
Compatible color.

469
00:48:59,284 --> 00:49:02,829
lf you had all that here, why would you
want to go back to Puerto Rico?

470
00:49:02,912 --> 00:49:06,332
Even if you didn't have all that here,
why would you want to go back?

471
00:49:06,374 --> 00:49:08,084
lt's so good here?

472
00:49:08,167 --> 00:49:11,421
lt's so good there?
We had nothing.

473
00:49:11,504 --> 00:49:14,841
Ah, we still have nothing,
only more expensive.

474
00:49:16,134 --> 00:49:18,636
Anita Josephina...

475
00:49:18,678 --> 00:49:21,055
- Beatriz del Carmen Margarita.
- lt's plain Anita now.

476
00:49:21,139 --> 00:49:24,601
- Et cetera.
- Leave me alone. At least l--

477
00:49:24,684 --> 00:49:26,936
Once an immigrant,
always an immigrant.

478
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:30,023
Hey, look, instead of a shampoo,
she's been brainwashed.

479
00:49:30,106 --> 00:49:32,859
- Stop it.
- She's given up Puerto Rico.

480
00:49:32,901 --> 00:49:34,861
Now she's queer for Uncle Sam.

481
00:49:34,903 --> 00:49:38,531
Oh, no. That's not true.

482
00:49:38,573 --> 00:49:41,409
Puerto Rico

483
00:49:41,492 --> 00:49:44,412
My heart's devotion

484
00:49:44,454 --> 00:49:46,623
Let it sink back

485
00:49:46,706 --> 00:49:49,584
ln the ocean

486
00:49:50,835 --> 00:49:55,423
Always the hurricanes blowing

487
00:49:55,506 --> 00:49:58,885
Always the population growing

488
00:50:00,136 --> 00:50:03,056
And the money owing

489
00:50:03,097 --> 00:50:06,017
And the sunlight streaming

490
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,478
And the natives steaming

491
00:50:08,519 --> 00:50:12,523
l like the island Manhattan

492
00:50:12,607 --> 00:50:13,942
l know you do.

493
00:50:13,983 --> 00:50:16,653
Smoke on your pipe

494
00:50:16,694 --> 00:50:18,947
And put that in

495
00:50:23,117 --> 00:50:25,453
l like to be in America

496
00:50:25,536 --> 00:50:27,789
Okay by me in America

497
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,999
Everything free in America

498
00:50:30,083 --> 00:50:33,253
For a small fee in America

499
00:50:36,881 --> 00:50:39,217
Buying on credit is so nice

500
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:42,637
One look at us
and they charge twice

501
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:44,889
l have my own washing machine

502
00:50:44,973 --> 00:50:47,642
What will you have though
to keep clean

503
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,979
Skyscrapers bloom in America

504
00:50:51,062 --> 00:50:53,314
Cadillacs zoom in America

505
00:50:53,398 --> 00:50:55,650
lndustry boom in America

506
00:50:55,733 --> 00:50:58,194
Twelve in a room in America

507
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:05,034
Lots of new housing
with more space

508
00:51:05,118 --> 00:51:08,246
Lots of doors slamming
in our face

509
00:51:08,288 --> 00:51:10,832
l'll get a terrace apartment

510
00:51:10,915 --> 00:51:13,251
Better get rid of your accent

511
00:51:14,627 --> 00:51:16,838
Life can be bright in America

512
00:51:16,921 --> 00:51:19,048
lf you can fight in America

513
00:51:19,132 --> 00:51:21,509
Life is all right in America

514
00:51:21,551 --> 00:51:24,762
lf you're all white in America

515
00:51:53,791 --> 00:51:56,294
La-la-la, la-la, America

516
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,974
Here you are free
and you have pride

517
00:52:10,058 --> 00:52:13,394
Long as you stay
on your own side

518
00:52:13,478 --> 00:52:15,855
Free to be anything
you choose

519
00:52:15,897 --> 00:52:18,233
Free to wait tables
and shine shoes

520
00:52:19,484 --> 00:52:21,736
Everywhere grime in America

521
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:24,030
Organized crime in America

522
00:52:24,113 --> 00:52:26,324
Terrible time in America

523
00:52:26,366 --> 00:52:28,993
You forget l'm in America

524
00:53:11,828 --> 00:53:14,122
l think l go back
to San Juan

525
00:53:14,205 --> 00:53:17,667
l know a boat you can get on
Bye-bye!

526
00:53:17,750 --> 00:53:19,836
Everyone there
will give big cheer

527
00:53:19,919 --> 00:53:22,422
Everyone there
will have moved here

528
00:54:35,328 --> 00:54:38,206
Come on! Hey, Chino.

529
00:54:38,289 --> 00:54:40,208
What are you doing?

530
00:54:47,799 --> 00:54:50,760
- Meet me on the roof later.
- Meet me on the roof later.

531
00:54:50,843 --> 00:54:53,763
- Well, will you or won't you?
- Well, will you or won't you?

532
00:54:56,057 --> 00:54:57,517
Well, will you?

533
00:54:57,600 --> 00:55:00,853
You have your big,
important war council.

534
00:55:00,937 --> 00:55:04,232
The council or me?

535
00:55:04,274 --> 00:55:06,025
First one...

536
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:09,612
and then the other.

537
00:55:10,947 --> 00:55:13,283
l'm an American girl now.

538
00:55:13,366 --> 00:55:15,368
l don't wait.

539
00:55:15,410 --> 00:55:17,537
Back home,
women know their place.

540
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:20,665
Back home, little boys
don't have war councils.

541
00:55:20,748 --> 00:55:22,250
But they do here.

542
00:55:23,167 --> 00:55:26,045
You want me to be
an American, don't you?

543
00:55:38,433 --> 00:55:39,976
lmmigrant!

544
00:55:46,608 --> 00:55:48,776
Good night, Maria.

545
00:55:48,860 --> 00:55:50,486
Good night.

546
00:56:21,768 --> 00:56:23,186
Quiet!

547
00:56:30,068 --> 00:56:30,985
Come down.

548
00:56:32,820 --> 00:56:36,658
Please. My mother
and father will wake up.

549
00:56:36,741 --> 00:56:38,826
Just for a minute.

550
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:40,787
A minute is not enough.

551
00:56:40,828 --> 00:56:42,705
- For an hour then.
- l cannot.

552
00:56:42,789 --> 00:56:45,667
Then forever!
Then l'm comin' up.

553
00:56:50,964 --> 00:56:52,882
Now see what you've done.

554
00:56:56,094 --> 00:56:58,888
lt is dangerous.
lf Bernardo knew--

555
00:56:58,972 --> 00:57:02,141
We'll let him know.
l'm not one of 'em, Maria.

556
00:57:02,225 --> 00:57:05,728
But you are not one of us,
and l am not one of you.

557
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:08,064
- To me you're all the beautiful--
- Maruca.

558
00:57:19,534 --> 00:57:21,452
His pet name for me.

559
00:57:21,536 --> 00:57:23,621
l like him,
and he will like me.

560
00:57:26,249 --> 00:57:29,627
He is like Bernardo-- afraid.

561
00:57:30,753 --> 00:57:32,880
lmagine being afraid of you.

562
00:57:32,964 --> 00:57:36,092
- You see?
- l see you.

563
00:57:36,134 --> 00:57:39,095
Oh, Maria, see only me.

564
00:57:40,054 --> 00:57:42,098
Only you

565
00:57:42,181 --> 00:57:47,270
You're the only thing
l'll see forever

566
00:57:47,353 --> 00:57:51,858
ln my eyes, in my words
and in everything l do

567
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:55,695
Nothing else but you ever

568
00:57:55,778 --> 00:57:59,657
And there's nothing for me but Maria

569
00:57:59,699 --> 00:58:03,745
Every sight that l see is Maria

570
00:58:04,329 --> 00:58:06,456
Tony, Tony

571
00:58:06,497 --> 00:58:10,251
Always you
Every thought l'll ever know

572
00:58:10,335 --> 00:58:12,712
Everywhere l go
you'll be

573
00:58:12,754 --> 00:58:17,175
All the world
is only you and me

574
00:58:24,057 --> 00:58:27,060
Tonight, tonight

575
00:58:27,143 --> 00:58:29,896
lt all began tonight

576
00:58:29,979 --> 00:58:35,902
l saw you
and the world went away

577
00:58:38,905 --> 00:58:41,532
There's only you tonight

578
00:58:41,616 --> 00:58:44,494
What you are
What you do

579
00:58:44,535 --> 00:58:47,956
What you say

580
00:58:47,997 --> 00:58:49,707
Today

581
00:58:49,791 --> 00:58:52,418
All day l had the feeling

582
00:58:52,502 --> 00:58:55,171
A miracle would happen

583
00:58:55,213 --> 00:58:59,634
l know now l was right

584
00:58:59,717 --> 00:59:02,679
For here you are

585
00:59:02,762 --> 00:59:05,223
And what was just a world

586
00:59:05,265 --> 00:59:10,853
ls a star tonight

587
00:59:28,413 --> 00:59:33,710
The world is full of light

588
00:59:33,793 --> 00:59:39,966
With suns and moons
all over the place

589
00:59:42,927 --> 00:59:45,346
The world is wild and bright

590
00:59:45,430 --> 00:59:51,436
Going mad
Shooting sparks into space

591
00:59:51,519 --> 00:59:55,773
Today the world
was just an address

592
00:59:55,857 --> 00:59:58,610
A place for me to live in

593
00:59:58,693 --> 01:00:02,989
No better than all right

594
01:00:03,072 --> 01:00:05,783
But here you are

595
01:00:05,867 --> 01:00:08,328
And what was just a world

596
01:00:08,369 --> 01:00:14,751
ls a star tonight

597
01:00:21,674 --> 01:00:23,927
l cannot stay.
Go quickly.

598
01:00:23,968 --> 01:00:26,596
- l'm not afraid.
- Please.

599
01:00:39,817 --> 01:00:41,402
Good night.

600
01:01:01,172 --> 01:01:02,590
l love you.

601
01:01:04,259 --> 01:01:05,718
Yes.

602
01:01:06,761 --> 01:01:08,596
Yes, hurry.

603
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:17,021
- When will l see you?
- Tomorrow.

604
01:01:17,105 --> 01:01:20,066
l work at the bridal shop
across the street-- Madam Lucia's.

605
01:01:20,149 --> 01:01:22,569
- l'll come there.
- At closing time, 6:00.

606
01:01:39,002 --> 01:01:41,629
When you come,
use the back door.

607
01:01:59,814 --> 01:02:01,816
What does "Tony" stand for?

608
01:02:03,568 --> 01:02:04,861
Anton.

609
01:02:14,621 --> 01:02:18,625
Good night

610
01:02:21,461 --> 01:02:27,467
Sleep well
and when you dream

611
01:02:27,550 --> 01:02:31,679
Dream of me

612
01:02:35,516 --> 01:02:39,604
Tonight

613
01:02:58,915 --> 01:03:02,624
- Where the devil are them Sharks?
- Maybe they're too chicken to show.

614
01:03:02,708 --> 01:03:05,377
We got time, A-rab.
Riff and lce ain't even here yet.

615
01:03:05,419 --> 01:03:08,589
- Come on, come on.
- He don't use a switchblade.

616
01:03:08,672 --> 01:03:12,050
- He don't even use an atomic ray gun.
- Who don't?

617
01:03:12,134 --> 01:03:14,845
Captain Marvel.
Gee, l love him.

618
01:03:14,928 --> 01:03:16,221
So marry him!

619
01:03:16,305 --> 01:03:19,016
l ain't never gonna get married.
Too noisy.

620
01:03:19,099 --> 01:03:22,394
You ain't never gonna get married.
Too ugly.

621
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:27,733
Down goes a teenage hoodlum.

622
01:03:27,774 --> 01:03:31,236
Gee, could a real zip gun
make you do like that?

623
01:03:31,320 --> 01:03:34,907
l know what a zip gun could make you do.
You better wear diapers.

624
01:03:34,990 --> 01:03:38,243
Go walk the streets
like your sister.

625
01:03:38,327 --> 01:03:41,747
Listen, jail bait. l licked you twice,
and l can do it again!

626
01:03:47,669 --> 01:03:50,088
Come on, Anybodys,
knock it off.

627
01:03:50,172 --> 01:03:53,592
- Riff's here.
- Jets all present and accounted for?

628
01:03:53,675 --> 01:03:55,886
l'm proud of ya.
Ya done good at the dance.

629
01:03:55,969 --> 01:03:58,347
- So where are they?
- Unwind, Action!

630
01:03:58,430 --> 01:04:00,474
- Any sign of Tony?
- The lnvisible Man.

631
01:04:00,557 --> 01:04:02,684
What do you think
the Sharks are gonna ask for?

632
01:04:02,768 --> 01:04:04,895
- Mercy.
- Just rubber hoses maybe.

633
01:04:04,978 --> 01:04:07,814
- Relax, little man.
- You tell him, Daddy-O.

634
01:04:07,856 --> 01:04:10,359
- l'm ready.
- Easy. Cool.

635
01:04:12,486 --> 01:04:15,739
Riff, in a tight spot,
you gonna need every man you can get.

636
01:04:16,990 --> 01:04:18,992
An American tragedy.

637
01:04:22,621 --> 01:04:25,457
Look. When the Sharks come,
you chicks cut out.

638
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:29,253
We might,
and then again, we might not.

639
01:04:29,336 --> 01:04:32,089
This ain't kid stuff, Graziella.

640
01:04:32,130 --> 01:04:35,259
l and Velma ain't
kid stuff, neither.

641
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,136
- Are we, Vel?
- No, thank you.

642
01:04:39,763 --> 01:04:41,723
And you can punctuate it.

643
01:04:44,351 --> 01:04:47,396
What are we poopin' around
with dumb broads?

644
01:04:47,479 --> 01:04:49,481
l and Velma ain't dumb.

645
01:04:49,565 --> 01:04:50,774
The bulls!

646
01:04:53,527 --> 01:04:55,445
- Hey, you.
- Hey, who?

647
01:04:55,529 --> 01:04:57,573
- Who? Me?
- Her?

648
01:04:57,656 --> 01:04:59,950
Top o' the evening,
Officer Krupke.

649
01:05:00,659 --> 01:05:01,910
You!

650
01:05:01,994 --> 01:05:03,870
- Me, sir?
- Yeah, you.

651
01:05:03,912 --> 01:05:06,623
- Didn't you hear me?
- Yes, sir.

652
01:05:06,707 --> 01:05:08,792
l got twenty-twenty hearin'.

653
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:12,462
-Then why didn't you answer me?
-His mother told him not to answer cops.

654
01:05:12,546 --> 01:05:16,300
- Wise apple, you want me to run you in?
- lndeed not, sir.

655
01:05:16,383 --> 01:05:18,844
l oughta run
all you punks in.

656
01:05:18,927 --> 01:05:21,054
What are you standin'
around here for?

657
01:05:21,138 --> 01:05:24,266
You see, sir,
we're afraid to go home.

658
01:05:24,349 --> 01:05:26,268
Such a bad environment.

659
01:05:26,351 --> 01:05:28,854
- We don't get no love there.
- Oh, it's awful.

660
01:05:28,937 --> 01:05:31,273
lf you don't leave us
stay out in the streets...

661
01:05:31,356 --> 01:05:34,484
we liable to turn into
a bunch of juvenile delinquents.

662
01:05:34,568 --> 01:05:37,487
l know you guys was cookin' up
somethin' at the dance tonight...

663
01:05:37,571 --> 01:05:39,489
so don't think you're gonna
put nothin' over on me.

664
01:05:39,573 --> 01:05:42,117
Sergeant, come on.
We got a 10-13.

665
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:44,369
Now go on, get a move on,
all of you.

666
01:05:44,453 --> 01:05:46,622
Don't let me catch none of you
around here when l get back.

667
01:05:46,705 --> 01:05:48,624
l'll see you around now.

668
01:05:51,543 --> 01:05:55,213
- You forgot to say good-bye.
- Them headbusters ain't got no manners.

669
01:05:55,297 --> 01:05:57,507
Don't let me catch none of you
around here when l get back.

670
01:05:57,591 --> 01:06:00,552
- They treat us like we ain't human.
- He was pretty mad, huh?

671
01:06:00,636 --> 01:06:03,013
So what happened?
A big fat nothin', right?

672
01:06:03,055 --> 01:06:06,642
Yeah, but suppose he comes back while us
and the Sharks are havin' a war council?

673
01:06:06,725 --> 01:06:08,644
We'll snow him some more.

674
01:06:08,685 --> 01:06:12,940
Them cops believe everything they read
in the papers about us cruddy J.D.'s...

675
01:06:13,023 --> 01:06:15,525
so we give 'em
somethin' to believe in.

676
01:06:15,609 --> 01:06:17,611
Hey, you!

677
01:06:17,694 --> 01:06:20,197
- Who, me, Officer Krupke?
- Yeah, you!

678
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:24,993
Give me one good reason for not draggin'
ya down to the station house, ya punk!

679
01:06:25,077 --> 01:06:28,038
Dear kindly Sergeant Krupke

680
01:06:28,121 --> 01:06:29,748
Ya gotta understand

681
01:06:29,831 --> 01:06:33,126
lt's just our bringin' up-ke
that gets out outta hand

682
01:06:33,210 --> 01:06:36,505
Our mothers all are junkies
Our fathers all are drunks

683
01:06:36,588 --> 01:06:39,800
Golly Moses
Naturally we're punks

684
01:06:39,883 --> 01:06:43,178
Gee, Officer Krupke
We're very upset

685
01:06:43,262 --> 01:06:46,640
We never had the love
that every child oughta get

686
01:06:46,723 --> 01:06:50,269
We ain't no delinquents
We're misunderstood

687
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:53,272
- Deep down inside us there is good
- There is good

688
01:06:53,355 --> 01:06:56,650
There is good, there is good
There is untapped good

689
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:59,820
Like inside
the worst of us is good

690
01:07:04,533 --> 01:07:08,412
- That's a touchin' good story!
- Let me tell it to the world!

691
01:07:08,453 --> 01:07:10,581
Just tell it to the judge!

692
01:07:16,003 --> 01:07:19,006
Dear kindly Judge
Your Honor

693
01:07:19,089 --> 01:07:20,674
My parents treat me rough

694
01:07:20,757 --> 01:07:23,760
With all their marijuana
they won't give me a puff

695
01:07:23,844 --> 01:07:27,180
They didn't wanna have me
But somehow l was had

696
01:07:27,264 --> 01:07:30,225
Leapin' lizards
That's why l'm so bad

697
01:07:30,309 --> 01:07:33,770
Right! Officer Krupke
you're really a square

698
01:07:33,854 --> 01:07:37,024
This boy don't need a judge
He needs an analyst's care

699
01:07:37,107 --> 01:07:40,402
lt's just his neurosis
that oughta be curbed

700
01:07:40,485 --> 01:07:43,572
- He's psychologically disturbed
- l'm disturbed

701
01:07:43,614 --> 01:07:46,742
We're disturbed, we're disturbed
We're the most disturbed

702
01:07:46,825 --> 01:07:48,994
Like we're psychologically disturbed

703
01:07:54,207 --> 01:07:55,626
Hear ye! Hear ye!

704
01:07:55,709 --> 01:07:58,629
ln the opinion of this court,
this child is depraved...

705
01:07:58,712 --> 01:08:00,756
on account he ain't had
a normal home.

706
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:03,467
Hey, l'm depraved
on account l'm deprived!

707
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:06,011
So take him to a headshrinker.
You!

708
01:08:06,053 --> 01:08:07,679
Who, me?

709
01:08:14,394 --> 01:08:18,815
My daddy beats my mommy
My mommy clobbers me

710
01:08:18,857 --> 01:08:22,110
My grandpa is a commie
My grandma pushes tea

711
01:08:22,194 --> 01:08:25,614
My sister wears a mustache
My brother wears a dress

712
01:08:25,656 --> 01:08:29,284
Goodness gracious
That's why l'm a mess

713
01:08:29,326 --> 01:08:32,829
Yes! Officer Krupke
he shouldn't be here

714
01:08:32,913 --> 01:08:36,041
This boy don't need a couch
He needs a useful career

715
01:08:36,124 --> 01:08:39,461
Society's played him
a terrible trick

716
01:08:39,544 --> 01:08:42,422
- And sociologically he's sick
- l am sick

717
01:08:42,506 --> 01:08:45,634
We are sick, we are sick
We are sick, sick, sick

718
01:08:45,717 --> 01:08:48,262
Like we're sociologically sick

719
01:08:54,893 --> 01:08:58,438
ln my opinion, this child does not need
to have his head shrunk at all.

720
01:08:58,480 --> 01:09:02,109
Juvenile delinquency
is purely a social disease.

721
01:09:02,192 --> 01:09:05,070
Hey, l got a social disease!

722
01:09:05,112 --> 01:09:06,863
Take him to a social worker.

723
01:09:06,947 --> 01:09:08,323
- Which way?
- That way.

724
01:09:14,121 --> 01:09:16,999
Dear kindly social worker

725
01:09:17,082 --> 01:09:18,709
They tell me
get a job

726
01:09:18,792 --> 01:09:22,004
Like be a soda-jerker
Which means like be a slob

727
01:09:22,087 --> 01:09:25,299
lt's not l'm antisocial
l'm only anti-work

728
01:09:25,382 --> 01:09:28,260
Gloryosky
That's why l'm a jerk

729
01:09:28,343 --> 01:09:31,430
Officer Krupke
you've done it again

730
01:09:31,513 --> 01:09:35,017
This boy don't need a job
He needs a year in the pen

731
01:09:35,100 --> 01:09:38,186
lt ain't just a question
of misunderstood

732
01:09:38,270 --> 01:09:40,939
- Deep down inside him he's no good
- l'm no good

733
01:09:41,023 --> 01:09:44,151
We're no good, we're no good
We're no earthly good

734
01:09:44,234 --> 01:09:46,778
Like the best of us
is no damn good

735
01:09:49,072 --> 01:09:52,034
- The trouble is he's lazy
- The trouble is he drinks

736
01:09:52,117 --> 01:09:54,995
- The trouble is he's crazy
- The trouble is he stinks

737
01:09:55,037 --> 01:09:58,123
- The trouble is he's growing
- The trouble is he's grown

738
01:09:58,206 --> 01:10:01,501
Krupke, we got troubles
of our own

739
01:10:01,585 --> 01:10:05,631
Gee, Officer Krupke
we're down on our knees

740
01:10:05,672 --> 01:10:09,635
'Cause no one wants a fella
with a social disease

741
01:10:09,718 --> 01:10:14,264
Gee, Officer Krupke
what are we to do

742
01:10:15,224 --> 01:10:18,477
Gee, Officer Krupke
Krup you

743
01:10:22,439 --> 01:10:25,484
Curfew, gentlemen,
and ladies.

744
01:10:25,567 --> 01:10:27,653
Aren't you up a little late,
Baby John?

745
01:10:27,736 --> 01:10:30,072
l got insomnia, Doc.
Too many worries.

746
01:10:30,155 --> 01:10:32,866
- Any of you seen Tony tonight?
- You bet ya we did.

747
01:10:32,950 --> 01:10:34,952
He was supposed to
clean up the store.

748
01:10:35,035 --> 01:10:37,955
So maybe he decided
to clean up the P.R.s instead.

749
01:10:41,917 --> 01:10:44,670
- Doc, you ain't gonna close up now?
- l'm not?

750
01:10:44,753 --> 01:10:47,381
- Listen, we got a war council here.
- A who?

751
01:10:47,464 --> 01:10:50,509
- To determine weapons.
- We gonna set up a mix with the P.R.s.

752
01:10:50,550 --> 01:10:53,637
Weapons.
You couldn't play basketball?

753
01:10:53,762 --> 01:10:55,097
Get with it, buster.

754
01:10:55,078 --> 01:10:58,331
You don't understand.
We got special business comin' here.

755
01:10:58,414 --> 01:11:01,876
- Makin' trouble for the Puerto Ricans?
- They make trouble for us.

756
01:11:01,918 --> 01:11:04,128
For you, trouble is a relief.

757
01:11:04,212 --> 01:11:06,714
We gotta stand up to 'em.
lt's important.

758
01:11:06,756 --> 01:11:09,842
Fightin' over a little piece
of street is so important?

759
01:11:09,884 --> 01:11:12,220
- To us it is.
- To hoodlums it is.

760
01:11:12,303 --> 01:11:14,222
- Who you callin' hoodlums?
- War councils--

761
01:11:14,305 --> 01:11:16,683
- Don't start, Doc.
- When l was your age--

762
01:11:16,724 --> 01:11:18,184
When you was my age?

763
01:11:18,267 --> 01:11:21,688
When my old man was my age--
my brother was my age.

764
01:11:21,771 --> 01:11:24,023
You was never my age,
none of ya.

765
01:11:24,107 --> 01:11:27,402
And the sooner you creeps get hip
to that, the sooner you'll dig us!

766
01:11:27,485 --> 01:11:30,279
l'll dig you an early grave,
that's what l'll dig.

767
01:11:30,321 --> 01:11:31,990
Dig, dig, dig.

768
01:12:15,742 --> 01:12:18,202
Okay, Doc, set 'em up.
Cokes all around.

769
01:12:18,286 --> 01:12:20,204
Let's get down to business.

770
01:12:20,288 --> 01:12:23,082
Bernardo hasn't learned
the procedures of gracious livin'.

771
01:12:23,166 --> 01:12:26,419
l don't like you either,
so cut it.

772
01:12:26,502 --> 01:12:29,005
- Kick it, Doc.
- Boys, couldn't you maybe talk--

773
01:12:29,088 --> 01:12:30,798
Kick it!

774
01:12:46,314 --> 01:12:48,316
We challenge you to a rumble.

775
01:12:48,358 --> 01:12:50,985
All out, once and for all.
Accept?

776
01:12:51,069 --> 01:12:54,364
- On what terms?
- Whatever terms you're callin'.

777
01:12:54,447 --> 01:12:56,783
You crossed the line
once too often.

778
01:12:56,866 --> 01:12:59,452
- You started it.
- Who jumped Baby John this afternoon?

779
01:12:59,535 --> 01:13:02,538
- Who jumped me first day l moved here?
- Who asked you to move here?

780
01:13:02,622 --> 01:13:04,582
- Move where you're wanted!
- Spics!

781
01:13:04,624 --> 01:13:06,250
- Mick!
- Wop!

782
01:13:14,342 --> 01:13:15,593
We accept.

783
01:13:17,095 --> 01:13:19,305
- Time.
- Tomorrow?

784
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:21,599
After dark.

785
01:13:24,352 --> 01:13:26,312
- Place.
- The park?

786
01:13:29,023 --> 01:13:29,983
The river.

787
01:13:34,862 --> 01:13:36,280
Under the highway.

788
01:13:40,034 --> 01:13:42,078
- Weapons.
- Hey, Doc!

789
01:13:44,330 --> 01:13:45,248
Weapons.

790
01:13:50,920 --> 01:13:53,298
- You call.
- Your challenge.

791
01:13:54,465 --> 01:13:56,384
Afraid to call?

792
01:14:00,263 --> 01:14:02,015
Rocks.

793
01:14:02,098 --> 01:14:04,309
- Belts.
- Pipes.

794
01:14:04,350 --> 01:14:06,436
- Cans.
- Bricks.

795
01:14:06,519 --> 01:14:07,687
- Bats!
- Clubs!

796
01:14:07,770 --> 01:14:10,606
- Chains!
- Bottles, knives, guns!

797
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:14,027
- What a coop full of chickens.
- Who you callin' chicken?

798
01:14:14,110 --> 01:14:16,821
- Every dog knows his own.
- l'm callin' you all chicken.

799
01:14:16,863 --> 01:14:19,532
Big tough buddy boys
gotta throw bricks, huh?

800
01:14:19,615 --> 01:14:22,035
Afraid to get in close?
Afraid to slug it out?

801
01:14:22,076 --> 01:14:24,662
- Afraid to use plain skin?
- Not even garbage?

802
01:14:24,704 --> 01:14:26,497
- That ain't a rumble.
- Who says?

803
01:14:26,581 --> 01:14:30,251
- You said call weapons.
- lt can be clinched by a fair fight.

804
01:14:30,335 --> 01:14:34,130
lf you've got the guts to risk that.
Best man from each gang to slug it out.

805
01:14:36,591 --> 01:14:40,345
l would enjoy to risk that.
Okay, fair fight.

806
01:14:40,428 --> 01:14:43,556
Wait a minute.
The commanders say yes or no.

807
01:14:45,725 --> 01:14:47,018
Fair fight.

808
01:14:49,812 --> 01:14:51,814
When l get through with you...

809
01:14:51,898 --> 01:14:54,233
you will be like a fish
after skinning.

810
01:14:54,317 --> 01:14:56,944
Your best man
fights our best man...

811
01:14:57,028 --> 01:14:59,697
and we pick him.

812
01:15:01,157 --> 01:15:03,076
- l thought l would be fighting--
- You shook on it.

813
01:15:07,372 --> 01:15:09,332
Yes, l shook on it.

814
01:15:09,374 --> 01:15:12,001
lf you wanna change your mind,
we can still--

815
01:15:22,345 --> 01:15:25,640
- Bernardo, would you like a cigarette?
- No, thank you. l don't smoke.

816
01:15:30,561 --> 01:15:32,814
Evening, Lieutenant.

817
01:15:32,897 --> 01:15:35,108
l and Tony was just closin' up.

818
01:15:36,609 --> 01:15:40,780
Well, now,
this is more like it, fellas.

819
01:15:40,863 --> 01:15:43,241
Warms me all over
to see you this way.

820
01:15:43,324 --> 01:15:46,911
And after only a couple of words from me
at the playground this afternoon.

821
01:15:46,995 --> 01:15:48,788
Oh, do you mind?

822
01:15:48,871 --> 01:15:52,041
l have no mind.
l'm the village idiot.

823
01:15:53,209 --> 01:15:56,462
Headquarters hears about this,
l may even get a promotion.

824
01:15:57,672 --> 01:15:59,799
Good deal all around,
huh, Bernardo?

825
01:16:00,967 --> 01:16:02,927
l get a promotion...

826
01:16:02,969 --> 01:16:06,306
and you Puerto Ricans
get what you've been itchin' for.

827
01:16:06,347 --> 01:16:08,891
Use of the playground,
use of the gym...

828
01:16:08,933 --> 01:16:12,395
the streets, the candy store.

829
01:16:12,478 --> 01:16:16,399
So what if they do turn this whole town
into a stinkin' pigsty?

830
01:16:16,441 --> 01:16:18,526
Don't stop him.
He wants to get home...

831
01:16:18,609 --> 01:16:21,487
write letters to San Juan,
tell 'em how he's got it made here.

832
01:16:23,281 --> 01:16:27,243
What l mean is, clear out!
l said, clear out!

833
01:16:30,788 --> 01:16:33,166
Oh, yeah, sure, l know.

834
01:16:33,249 --> 01:16:36,544
lt's a free country
and l ain't got the right.

835
01:16:36,628 --> 01:16:38,963
But l got a badge.

836
01:16:39,047 --> 01:16:41,174
What do you got?

837
01:16:41,257 --> 01:16:43,926
Things are tough all over.
Beat it!

838
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:18,086
Okay, fellas.

839
01:17:19,295 --> 01:17:21,422
Where's the rumble gonna be?

840
01:17:23,049 --> 01:17:26,469
Come on. l know regular Americans
don't rub with the gold-teeth unless--

841
01:17:26,552 --> 01:17:29,013
- Look, Lieutenant--
- You shut your mouth!

842
01:17:32,308 --> 01:17:34,394
Come on, Baby John...

843
01:17:34,477 --> 01:17:37,647
before that smooth little kisser
of yours gets cut up for life.

844
01:17:37,689 --> 01:17:39,399
Now, where's it gonna be?

845
01:17:40,108 --> 01:17:41,609
The river?

846
01:17:41,693 --> 01:17:43,528
The park?

847
01:17:47,198 --> 01:17:49,575
Look, fellas, l'm for you.

848
01:17:49,659 --> 01:17:52,745
l want this beat cleaned up,
and you can do it for me.

849
01:17:52,829 --> 01:17:55,248
l'll even lend a hand
if things get rough.

850
01:17:55,331 --> 01:17:57,417
Now, where ya gonna rumble?

851
01:18:00,253 --> 01:18:02,171
The playground?

852
01:18:03,965 --> 01:18:06,092
Sweeney's lot?

853
01:18:12,015 --> 01:18:15,226
Why don't you get smart,
you stupid hooligans?

854
01:18:15,310 --> 01:18:18,146
l oughta take you to the station
and throw you in the can right now.

855
01:18:18,187 --> 01:18:21,149
You and the tinhorn
immigrant scum you come from!

856
01:18:23,901 --> 01:18:26,195
How's your old man's d.t.'s, A-rab?

857
01:18:28,865 --> 01:18:30,825
How's the action on your
mother's side of the street, Action?

858
01:18:33,536 --> 01:18:35,830
One of these days
there won't be anybody to hold ya.

859
01:18:35,872 --> 01:18:38,124
Get him outta here!
Come on!

860
01:18:39,626 --> 01:18:42,170
Don't worry, l'll find out
where it's gonna be.

861
01:18:42,253 --> 01:18:46,549
So be sure to finish each other off,
because if you don't, l will!

862
01:18:55,975 --> 01:18:57,935
Oh, yeah, sure.

863
01:18:57,977 --> 01:18:59,771
Understand 'em.

864
01:18:59,854 --> 01:19:03,483
That's what they keep tellin' me
down at headquarters: understand.

865
01:19:03,566 --> 01:19:07,278
Well, you try keeping hoodlums in line
and see what it does to you.

866
01:19:11,366 --> 01:19:14,786
lt wouldn't give me
a mouth like his.

867
01:19:18,373 --> 01:19:21,876
Come on, Doc.
Don't let it get ya.

868
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,628
l'm sick.

869
01:19:23,711 --> 01:19:25,880
You heard.
lt's gonna be a fair fight.

870
01:19:25,964 --> 01:19:27,882
And that's gonna cure somethin'?

871
01:19:27,966 --> 01:19:32,387
From here on in,
everything's gonna be all right.

872
01:19:32,470 --> 01:19:34,889
- l got a feelin'.
- What have you been takin' tonight?

873
01:19:34,973 --> 01:19:36,766
A trip to the moon.

874
01:19:36,849 --> 01:19:40,395
And l'll tell ya a secret, Doc.
lt ain't a man that's up there.

875
01:19:40,478 --> 01:19:42,772
lt's a girl.

876
01:19:42,814 --> 01:19:44,899
A lady.

877
01:19:51,823 --> 01:19:54,075
So that's why you
made it a fair fight.

878
01:19:54,158 --> 01:19:56,119
l'm gonna see her tomorrow
and l can't wait.

879
01:19:58,121 --> 01:20:01,291
- Things aren't tough enough?
- Doc, l'm in love.

880
01:20:01,374 --> 01:20:04,127
- And you're not frightened?
- Should l be?

881
01:20:07,422 --> 01:20:10,383
No, l'm frightened enough
for the both of you.

882
01:22:43,028 --> 01:22:45,197
What has Chino done to her?

883
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:47,449
Chino? Why Chino?

884
01:22:47,532 --> 01:22:49,826
Maybe she's just
dolling up for us.

885
01:22:51,703 --> 01:22:53,497
Rosalia, Consuelo...

886
01:22:53,538 --> 01:22:56,416
my adorable friends,
can you keep a secret?

887
01:22:56,458 --> 01:22:58,418
l'm hot for secrets.

888
01:23:00,087 --> 01:23:02,547
No, l won't tell you.

889
01:23:02,631 --> 01:23:04,091
- What?
- What?

890
01:23:04,132 --> 01:23:07,678
- The poor girl is out of her mind.
- l am-- crazy.

891
01:23:07,761 --> 01:23:11,139
She might be at that.
She looks somehow different.

892
01:23:11,139 --> 01:23:13,975
- l do?
- And l think she is up to something.

893
01:23:14,059 --> 01:23:15,519
l am?

894
01:23:15,602 --> 01:23:18,313
''l do?'' ''l am?''
She talks like a parrot.

895
01:23:18,397 --> 01:23:20,816
What is going on with you, Maria?

896
01:23:20,857 --> 01:23:23,860
l feel pretty
Oh, so pretty

897
01:23:23,902 --> 01:23:27,030
l feel pretty and witty and gay

898
01:23:27,114 --> 01:23:31,326
And l pity any girl
who isn't me today

899
01:23:33,453 --> 01:23:36,456
l feel charming
Oh, so charming

900
01:23:36,540 --> 01:23:39,668
lt's alarming how charming l feel

901
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:44,089
And so pretty
That l hardly can believe l'm real

902
01:23:46,800 --> 01:23:49,970
See the pretty girl
in that mirror there

903
01:23:50,012 --> 01:23:53,098
Who can that attractive girl be

904
01:23:53,181 --> 01:23:54,766
Such a pretty face
Such a pretty dress

905
01:23:54,850 --> 01:23:57,102
Such a pretty smile
Such a pretty me

906
01:23:58,603 --> 01:24:01,606
l feel stunning
and entrancing

907
01:24:01,690 --> 01:24:04,860
Feel like running
and dancing for joy

908
01:24:04,943 --> 01:24:10,157
For l'm loved
by a pretty wonderful boy

909
01:24:14,828 --> 01:24:17,998
Have you met my good friend Maria

910
01:24:18,081 --> 01:24:21,251
The craziest girl on the block

911
01:24:21,335 --> 01:24:24,046
You'll know her
the minute you see her

912
01:24:24,129 --> 01:24:27,591
She's the one who is in
an advanced state of shock

913
01:24:27,674 --> 01:24:30,635
She thinks she's in love
She thinks she's in Spain

914
01:24:31,678 --> 01:24:34,890
She isn't in love
She's merely insane

915
01:24:35,682 --> 01:24:39,728
lt must be the heat
or some rare disease

916
01:24:39,811 --> 01:24:43,273
Or too much to eat
Or maybe it's fleas

917
01:24:44,149 --> 01:24:47,527
Keep away from her
Send for Chino

918
01:24:47,569 --> 01:24:50,572
This is not the Maria we know

919
01:24:50,656 --> 01:24:54,201
Modest and pure
polite and refined

920
01:24:54,284 --> 01:24:57,621
Well-bred and mature
and out of her mind

921
01:24:59,289 --> 01:25:01,166
Miss America!

922
01:25:03,460 --> 01:25:05,837
Miss America!
Bravo! Speech!

923
01:25:07,756 --> 01:25:10,842
l feel pretty
Oh, so pretty

924
01:25:10,926 --> 01:25:14,054
That the city
should give me its key

925
01:25:14,137 --> 01:25:18,141
A committee should be organized
to honor me

926
01:25:20,602 --> 01:25:23,647
l feel dizzy
l feel sunny

927
01:25:23,730 --> 01:25:26,942
l feel fizzy and funny and fine

928
01:25:26,983 --> 01:25:31,446
And so pretty
Miss America can just resign

929
01:25:34,199 --> 01:25:36,410
See the pretty girl
in that mirror there

930
01:25:36,451 --> 01:25:39,579
- What mirror where
- Who can that attractive girl be

931
01:25:39,663 --> 01:25:41,581
- Which, what, where, who
- Such a pretty face

932
01:25:41,665 --> 01:25:44,876
Such a pretty dress, such a pretty smile
Such a pretty me

933
01:25:46,461 --> 01:25:48,088
l feel stunning

934
01:25:48,130 --> 01:25:49,881
And entrancing

935
01:25:49,965 --> 01:25:52,801
Feel like running
and dancing for joy

936
01:25:52,884 --> 01:25:58,223
For l'm loved
by a pretty wonderful boy

937
01:26:07,065 --> 01:26:10,777
You want to sing, do it with needles,
or you'll be singing for your supper.

938
01:26:10,861 --> 01:26:14,448
But Madam Lucia, what can you expect?
We use Singer sewing machines.

939
01:26:14,531 --> 01:26:17,993
Sure. You make the bad joke home
where l can't hear it!

940
01:26:18,076 --> 01:26:21,121
Well, go now.
lt's closing time. Shoo!

941
01:26:24,333 --> 01:26:26,335
You pull down the shades,
pick up the pins...

942
01:26:26,376 --> 01:26:28,795
turn off the lights
and lock the doors.

943
01:26:34,301 --> 01:26:36,595
Oh, the jail is opened.

944
01:26:36,636 --> 01:26:38,597
l thought she'd never leave.

945
01:26:38,638 --> 01:26:42,642
lt's hard to believe that old bag
was once a young bag like us.

946
01:26:42,726 --> 01:26:45,520
Let's go before she
changes her mind and comes back.

947
01:26:45,604 --> 01:26:48,565
You go, querida.
l will lock up.

948
01:26:48,648 --> 01:26:50,901
- Why?
- l have work.

949
01:26:50,901 --> 01:26:54,154
- Do it tomorrow.
- l am in no hurry.

950
01:26:54,237 --> 01:26:58,992
l am. l'm going home now
and take a nice long bubble bath.

951
01:26:59,076 --> 01:27:00,369
Black Orchid.

952
01:27:03,205 --> 01:27:06,667
All over. l got a date with Nardo
after the rumble.

953
01:27:07,668 --> 01:27:08,960
What rumble?

954
01:27:10,462 --> 01:27:13,965
Oh, well, Nardo's Sharks
and those boys at the dance.

955
01:27:15,092 --> 01:27:17,386
They fight each other tonight?

956
01:27:17,469 --> 01:27:19,388
They don't play potsy.

957
01:27:21,682 --> 01:27:23,975
Why must they always fight?

958
01:27:24,059 --> 01:27:28,021
Well, you saw how they dance-- like
they gotta get rid of something quick.

959
01:27:28,105 --> 01:27:29,523
That's how they fight.

960
01:27:29,564 --> 01:27:32,317
To get rid of what?

961
01:27:32,401 --> 01:27:36,113
Too much feeling.
And they do get rid of it.

962
01:27:36,196 --> 01:27:40,409
Boy, after a fight,
that brother of yours is so healthy.

963
01:27:40,492 --> 01:27:43,161
Definitely: Black Orchid.

964
01:27:57,092 --> 01:28:00,137
''You go, querida.
l will lock up.''

965
01:28:03,432 --> 01:28:06,351
lt's too early for noches.
Buenas tardes.

966
01:28:11,398 --> 01:28:14,651
He just came from the drugstore
to deliver aspirin.

967
01:28:14,735 --> 01:28:17,821
- You'll need it.
- Not us.

968
01:28:17,863 --> 01:28:20,240
We're fine.
We're out of the world.

969
01:28:20,282 --> 01:28:22,534
You're out of your heads.

970
01:28:22,617 --> 01:28:26,705
- We're 12 feet in the air.
- Anita can see that.

971
01:28:31,335 --> 01:28:33,503
You will not tell?

972
01:28:36,631 --> 01:28:40,594
Tell what? How can l know
what goes on 12 feet over my head?

973
01:28:42,637 --> 01:28:46,058
You better be home in 15 minutes.

974
01:28:54,691 --> 01:28:57,527
lt's all right.
She likes us.

975
01:28:57,611 --> 01:29:00,155
But she is worried,
and so am l.

976
01:29:00,238 --> 01:29:03,325
- That's foolish.
- Are you going to that rumble tonight?

977
01:29:05,619 --> 01:29:08,121
- Why?
- You must go and stop it.

978
01:29:08,205 --> 01:29:11,708
l have stopped it. lt's only gonna be
a fistfight now between two of 'em.

979
01:29:11,792 --> 01:29:14,127
Any fight is no good for us.

980
01:29:14,211 --> 01:29:16,129
Everything is good for us.
We got magic.

981
01:29:16,213 --> 01:29:19,216
Listen, and hear me.

982
01:29:19,299 --> 01:29:20,926
You must go and stop it.

983
01:29:22,552 --> 01:29:24,471
lt means that much to you?

984
01:29:26,056 --> 01:29:27,516
l will, then.

985
01:29:28,725 --> 01:29:32,145
l believe you.
You do have magic.

986
01:29:32,229 --> 01:29:33,730
Of course.

987
01:29:34,815 --> 01:29:37,192
l've got you.

988
01:29:37,275 --> 01:29:41,446
And tonight, after l stop the rumble
that is no rumble, l'll come by for you.

989
01:29:41,530 --> 01:29:43,740
l will wait for you
on the roof.

990
01:29:45,200 --> 01:29:47,577
Not the roof.
l'll come to your house.

991
01:29:49,037 --> 01:29:51,206
You cannot.
My mama.

992
01:29:53,333 --> 01:29:56,211
- Then l'll take you to my house.
- Your mama.

993
01:29:59,297 --> 01:30:02,843
She'll come runnin' from the kitchen
to welcome ya. She lives in the kitchen.

994
01:30:02,926 --> 01:30:06,430
- Dressed so elegant?
- l told her you were comin'.

995
01:30:06,513 --> 01:30:09,433
She'll look at your face,
try not to smile, and say...

996
01:30:09,516 --> 01:30:11,852
''Skinny, but pretty.''

997
01:30:13,270 --> 01:30:14,646
She is plump, no doubt.

998
01:30:15,814 --> 01:30:16,815
Fat.

999
01:30:16,857 --> 01:30:20,485
l take after my mama--
delicate-boned.

1000
01:30:23,822 --> 01:30:25,741
Not in front of Mama!

1001
01:30:27,534 --> 01:30:30,329
l would like to see Papa in this.

1002
01:30:30,412 --> 01:30:32,664
Mama will make him
ask about your prospects.

1003
01:30:32,706 --> 01:30:33,665
Many.

1004
01:30:33,707 --> 01:30:36,585
- lf you go to church.
- Oh, always.

1005
01:30:38,086 --> 01:30:40,881
Yes, Papa might like you.

1006
01:30:43,008 --> 01:30:46,345
- May l have your daughter's hand?
- He says yes.

1007
01:30:49,556 --> 01:30:52,684
- And your mama?
- l'm afraid to ask her.

1008
01:30:52,768 --> 01:30:56,104
Tell her she's not getting a daughter.
She's getting rid of a son.

1009
01:30:59,441 --> 01:31:02,152
- She says yes.
- She has good taste.

1010
01:31:03,695 --> 01:31:05,947
Here. Maid of honor.

1011
01:31:05,989 --> 01:31:08,659
Oh, that color is bad for Anita.

1012
01:31:08,742 --> 01:31:11,161
- The best man.
- That is my papa!

1013
01:31:12,913 --> 01:31:14,623
Sorry, Papa.

1014
01:31:15,957 --> 01:31:19,127
Here we go, Riff.
Womb to tomb.

1015
01:31:19,211 --> 01:31:23,048
Now you see, Anita?
There was nothing to worry about.

1016
01:31:26,426 --> 01:31:29,096
Look. Mama's cryin' already.

1017
01:32:02,671 --> 01:32:06,383
l, Anton, take thee, Maria...

1018
01:32:06,425 --> 01:32:10,262
l, Maria, take thee, Anton...

1019
01:32:10,345 --> 01:32:12,973
for richer, for poorer...

1020
01:32:13,056 --> 01:32:16,435
in sickness and in health...

1021
01:32:16,518 --> 01:32:19,646
to love and to honor...

1022
01:32:19,730 --> 01:32:23,108
to hold and to keep...

1023
01:32:23,191 --> 01:32:26,987
from each sun to each moon...

1024
01:32:27,070 --> 01:32:29,448
from tomorrow to tomorrow...

1025
01:32:31,491 --> 01:32:33,994
from now to forever...

1026
01:32:35,203 --> 01:32:37,706
till death do us part.

1027
01:32:41,877 --> 01:32:45,297
With this ring, l thee wed.

1028
01:32:55,432 --> 01:32:58,810
Make of our hands

1029
01:32:58,894 --> 01:33:02,439
One hand

1030
01:33:02,522 --> 01:33:05,942
Make of our hearts

1031
01:33:05,984 --> 01:33:09,488
One heart

1032
01:33:09,529 --> 01:33:13,116
Make of our vows

1033
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:16,995
One last vow

1034
01:33:17,079 --> 01:33:20,624
Only death will

1035
01:33:20,707 --> 01:33:25,420
Part us now

1036
01:33:25,504 --> 01:33:29,049
Make of our lives

1037
01:33:29,132 --> 01:33:32,386
One life

1038
01:33:32,469 --> 01:33:35,931
Day after day

1039
01:33:36,014 --> 01:33:38,975
One life

1040
01:33:39,059 --> 01:33:42,729
Now it begins

1041
01:33:42,813 --> 01:33:45,607
Now we start

1042
01:33:45,649 --> 01:33:49,444
One hand

1043
01:33:49,486 --> 01:33:54,783
One heart

1044
01:33:54,866 --> 01:33:58,412
Even death

1045
01:33:58,495 --> 01:34:03,291
Won't part

1046
01:34:03,375 --> 01:34:06,586
Us now

1047
01:34:36,116 --> 01:34:40,537
The Jets are gonna
have their day tonight

1048
01:34:40,579 --> 01:34:45,125
The Jets are gonna
have their way tonight

1049
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:47,586
The Puerto Ricans grumble
Fair fight

1050
01:34:47,669 --> 01:34:51,798
But if they start a rumble
We'll rumble 'em right

1051
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:56,261
We're gonna hand 'em
a surprise tonight

1052
01:34:56,345 --> 01:35:00,682
We're gonna cut 'em
down to size tonight

1053
01:35:00,724 --> 01:35:03,226
We said, okay, no rumpus
No tricks

1054
01:35:03,310 --> 01:35:07,314
But just in case they jump us
We're ready to mix

1055
01:35:07,397 --> 01:35:08,482
Tonight

1056
01:35:09,358 --> 01:35:10,817
We're gonna rock it tonight

1057
01:35:10,901 --> 01:35:15,197
We're gonna jazz it up
and have us a ball

1058
01:35:15,280 --> 01:35:16,782
They're gonna get it tonight

1059
01:35:16,823 --> 01:35:21,203
The more they turn it on
the harder they'll fall

1060
01:35:21,286 --> 01:35:23,372
- Well, they began it
- Well, they began it

1061
01:35:23,455 --> 01:35:26,875
And we're the ones to stop 'em
once and for all

1062
01:35:26,958 --> 01:35:28,293
Tonight

1063
01:35:31,546 --> 01:35:36,051
Anita's gonna get
her kicks tonight

1064
01:35:36,134 --> 01:35:40,472
We'll have our private
little mix tonight

1065
01:35:40,555 --> 01:35:43,100
He'll walk in hot and tired
Poor dear

1066
01:35:43,183 --> 01:35:47,396
Don't matter if he's tired
as long as he's here

1067
01:35:47,479 --> 01:35:50,482
Tonight, tonight

1068
01:35:50,565 --> 01:35:53,527
Won't be just any night

1069
01:35:53,610 --> 01:35:59,241
Tonight there will be
no morning star

1070
01:36:02,703 --> 01:36:05,414
l'll see my love tonight

1071
01:36:05,497 --> 01:36:06,915
And for us

1072
01:36:06,999 --> 01:36:11,420
Stars will stop where they are

1073
01:36:11,503 --> 01:36:16,383
Today the minutes seem like hours

1074
01:36:16,466 --> 01:36:19,469
The hours go so slowly

1075
01:36:19,553 --> 01:36:23,765
And still the sky is light

1076
01:36:23,807 --> 01:36:27,144
Oh, moon
Grow bright

1077
01:36:27,227 --> 01:36:29,771
And make this endless day

1078
01:36:29,855 --> 01:36:33,692
Endless night

1079
01:36:41,825 --> 01:36:46,330
The Jets are comin'
out on top tonight

1080
01:36:46,413 --> 01:36:50,751
We're gonna watch
Bernardo drop tonight

1081
01:36:50,834 --> 01:36:53,462
The Puerto Rican punk'll go down

1082
01:36:53,545 --> 01:36:57,549
And when he's hollered uncle
We'll tear up the town

1083
01:36:57,632 --> 01:37:00,635
- We'll be in back of you, boy
- Right

1084
01:37:00,677 --> 01:37:02,971
- You're gonna flatten him good
- Right

1085
01:37:03,013 --> 01:37:06,767
Tonight there will be
no morning star

1086
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:09,436
And then we'll
have us a ball tonight

1087
01:37:09,519 --> 01:37:12,773
We're gonna rock it tonight

1088
01:37:12,814 --> 01:37:15,108
We're gonna jazz it tonight

1089
01:37:18,737 --> 01:37:20,697
We're gonna mix it tonight

1090
01:37:20,739 --> 01:37:25,619
Today the minutes
seem like hours

1091
01:37:25,702 --> 01:37:28,705
The hours go so slowly

1092
01:37:28,789 --> 01:37:30,749
And still the sky is light

1093
01:37:30,832 --> 01:37:34,002
We'll stop 'em once and for all

1094
01:37:34,044 --> 01:37:36,797
The Sharks are gonna
have their way

1095
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:39,800
The Jets are gonna
have their day

1096
01:37:39,883 --> 01:37:42,135
We're gonna rock it tonight

1097
01:37:42,219 --> 01:37:45,097
Tonight

1098
01:39:12,684 --> 01:39:13,894
Ready.

1099
01:39:19,733 --> 01:39:22,819
- Now move in and shake hands.
- For what?

1100
01:39:24,279 --> 01:39:26,990
Well, that's the way
it's done, buddy boy.

1101
01:39:28,158 --> 01:39:30,452
More gracious living.

1102
01:39:30,535 --> 01:39:33,580
Every one of you hates every one of us,
and we hate you right back.

1103
01:39:33,664 --> 01:39:36,083
- Let's get at it.
- Sure.

1104
01:39:55,936 --> 01:39:57,604
Hold it!

1105
01:40:01,441 --> 01:40:03,819
Get with the gang.
lt's all okay.

1106
01:40:03,860 --> 01:40:05,445
- No!
- What are you doin'?

1107
01:40:05,529 --> 01:40:08,657
Maybe he has found the guts
to fight his own battles.

1108
01:40:10,325 --> 01:40:12,828
lt don't take guts
if you got a battle.

1109
01:40:12,911 --> 01:40:16,790
We ain't got one, none of us.
Okay, Nardo?

1110
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:20,669
Hold it!
Let's cool it.

1111
01:40:20,752 --> 01:40:24,798
The deal is a fair fight
between you and lce. Get with the gang.

1112
01:40:24,881 --> 01:40:28,677
Mother hen protecting the little one?
l'll give you a battle, gallito.

1113
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:32,139
- You've got one!
- l'll take pretty boy on as a warm-up.

1114
01:40:32,848 --> 01:40:35,892
Afraid, pretty boy?
Afraid, gutless?

1115
01:40:35,976 --> 01:40:37,894
- Afraid, chicken?
- Cut it!

1116
01:40:40,731 --> 01:40:42,149
l don't want to.

1117
01:40:42,232 --> 01:40:44,234
- l'm sure.
- Now listen to me.

1118
01:40:44,276 --> 01:40:46,069
- Are you chicken?
- There's nothin' to fight about.

1119
01:40:46,153 --> 01:40:48,572
- The hell there ain't!
- You got it wrong!

1120
01:40:50,991 --> 01:40:53,327
- Why can't you understand?
- What do you say, chicken?

1121
01:40:55,370 --> 01:40:56,913
Kill him, Tony.

1122
01:40:56,997 --> 01:40:59,583
- Come on, man.
- Afraid to fight?

1123
01:41:01,001 --> 01:41:02,961
- Let me see you fight.
- What's the matter?

1124
01:41:03,003 --> 01:41:05,339
He's chicken, boy.

1125
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:07,382
He is chicken!

1126
01:41:07,424 --> 01:41:10,218
- Hey, pretty boy.
- Bernardo, listen.

1127
01:41:10,302 --> 01:41:13,221
Don't! Stop it!
We got nothin' to fight about.

1128
01:41:14,765 --> 01:41:17,392
- You yellowbellied chicken!
- Don't push me!

1129
01:41:17,476 --> 01:41:19,603
Come on,
you yellowbellied Pollack!

1130
01:41:34,576 --> 01:41:37,329
- Riff, what are you doin'?
- Get outta here, Tony!

1131
01:41:37,412 --> 01:41:38,955
Riff, don't!

1132
01:41:39,039 --> 01:41:42,125
- Hold him!
- lce, let me go!

1133
01:41:53,136 --> 01:41:54,721
Riff, don't!

1134
01:42:06,608 --> 01:42:08,235
Keep outta this!

1135
01:42:09,486 --> 01:42:11,238
Somebody stop him!

1136
01:42:11,321 --> 01:42:13,156
Let me go!

1137
01:42:49,901 --> 01:42:52,112
- Come on, Nardo!
- Stop him!

1138
01:42:54,489 --> 01:42:56,116
Riff, don't!

1139
01:43:26,938 --> 01:43:28,482
Get him!

1140
01:45:10,125 --> 01:45:12,502
Tony, come on.
Come on, Tony.

1141
01:45:12,586 --> 01:45:14,463
Gotta get outta here!
Come on!

1142
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:21,762
Come on, Tony.
Come on! Get outta here!

1143
01:45:33,940 --> 01:45:35,525
Come on!

1144
01:45:41,573 --> 01:45:43,533
Come on, Tony!

1145
01:46:08,308 --> 01:46:10,268
Wait for me, Rosa.

1146
01:47:19,546 --> 01:47:21,173
There was no one downstairs.

1147
01:47:22,341 --> 01:47:24,343
My mother and father
are at the store.

1148
01:47:24,426 --> 01:47:27,512
l didn't expect you to come by
or l would have waited down--

1149
01:47:28,180 --> 01:47:30,515
You have been fighting, Chino?

1150
01:47:30,599 --> 01:47:32,851
Yes. l am sorry.

1151
01:47:32,934 --> 01:47:35,646
That is not like you.

1152
01:47:35,729 --> 01:47:37,981
You must go home and wash up.

1153
01:47:38,065 --> 01:47:40,734
- l will see you tomorrow.
- Maria, at the rumble--

1154
01:47:40,817 --> 01:47:42,861
- There was no rumble.
- There was.

1155
01:47:42,944 --> 01:47:46,156
- You are wrong.
- Nobody meant for it to happen.

1156
01:47:52,704 --> 01:47:53,622
Tell me.

1157
01:47:55,290 --> 01:47:56,750
lt is bad.

1158
01:47:57,751 --> 01:47:58,835
Very bad?

1159
01:48:01,505 --> 01:48:03,090
You see--

1160
01:48:06,343 --> 01:48:08,679
lt will be easier
if you say it very fast.

1161
01:48:10,305 --> 01:48:12,224
There was a fight...

1162
01:48:13,141 --> 01:48:15,519
and Nardo--

1163
01:48:15,602 --> 01:48:18,105
Somehow a knife--

1164
01:48:18,188 --> 01:48:20,691
And Nardo and someone--

1165
01:48:22,234 --> 01:48:23,694
What happened to Tony?

1166
01:48:26,571 --> 01:48:28,699
Tell me!
ls Tony all right?

1167
01:48:31,785 --> 01:48:33,745
He killed your brother!

1168
01:48:41,128 --> 01:48:43,630
You are lying.

1169
01:48:43,714 --> 01:48:45,841
Chino, why do you lie to me?

1170
01:48:50,220 --> 01:48:53,056
Chino, you are lying! Lying!

1171
01:48:53,140 --> 01:48:55,058
Why do you lie?

1172
01:49:10,824 --> 01:49:14,703
Make it not be true.
Please make it not be true.

1173
01:49:14,745 --> 01:49:17,664
Madre de Dios,
l will do anything.

1174
01:49:17,706 --> 01:49:21,293
Make me die,
only please make it not be true.

1175
01:49:25,297 --> 01:49:27,257
Make it not be--

1176
01:49:32,179 --> 01:49:34,348
Killer! Killer! Killer!

1177
01:49:41,438 --> 01:49:43,398
l tried to stop it.

1178
01:49:44,733 --> 01:49:47,778
l did try.
l don't know what went wrong.

1179
01:49:47,861 --> 01:49:50,238
l didn't mean to hurt him.
l didn't wanna.

1180
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:53,116
But Riff was like my brother.
When Bernardo killed him--

1181
01:49:53,200 --> 01:49:56,411
Bernardo didn't
mean it either, l know.

1182
01:50:00,123 --> 01:50:02,042
l thought you knew.

1183
01:50:06,171 --> 01:50:08,924
l didn't come to tell you that.

1184
01:50:08,882 --> 01:50:11,843
Just for you to forgive me
so l could go to the police.

1185
01:50:13,095 --> 01:50:14,721
- lt'll be easy now.
- l won't let you.

1186
01:50:14,805 --> 01:50:17,307
- l must.
- Stay with me.

1187
01:50:17,349 --> 01:50:20,227
- Maria, l love you so much.
- Don't leave me.

1188
01:50:20,310 --> 01:50:23,146
- Whatever you want, l'll do.
- Hold me.

1189
01:50:23,188 --> 01:50:25,691
- Oh, forever.
- Tighter.

1190
01:50:26,650 --> 01:50:28,569
We'll be all right,
l know it.

1191
01:50:28,652 --> 01:50:31,113
We're really together now.

1192
01:50:31,196 --> 01:50:33,156
But it's not us.

1193
01:50:34,616 --> 01:50:36,910
lt's everything around us.

1194
01:50:38,036 --> 01:50:41,373
Then l'll take you away,
where nothin' can get to us.

1195
01:50:42,791 --> 01:50:45,752
Not anyone or anything.

1196
01:50:47,504 --> 01:50:54,887
There's a place for us

1197
01:50:56,471 --> 01:51:02,853
Somewhere a place for us

1198
01:51:02,936 --> 01:51:05,439
Peace and quiet

1199
01:51:05,480 --> 01:51:09,026
And open air

1200
01:51:09,109 --> 01:51:14,823
Wait for us somewhere

1201
01:51:17,618 --> 01:51:23,916
There's a time for us

1202
01:51:23,999 --> 01:51:28,420
Someday a time for us

1203
01:51:28,503 --> 01:51:33,091
Time together with time to spare

1204
01:51:33,175 --> 01:51:35,344
Time to look

1205
01:51:35,385 --> 01:51:40,182
Time to care someday

1206
01:51:40,224 --> 01:51:43,101
Somewhere

1207
01:51:43,185 --> 01:51:47,940
We'll find a new way of living

1208
01:51:48,023 --> 01:51:52,903
We'll find a way of forgiving

1209
01:51:52,986 --> 01:51:55,656
Somewhere

1210
01:52:01,495 --> 01:52:07,376
There's a place for us

1211
01:52:07,459 --> 01:52:11,672
A time and place for us

1212
01:52:11,755 --> 01:52:16,385
Hold my hand
and we're halfway there

1213
01:52:16,426 --> 01:52:20,889
Hold my hand
and l'll take you there

1214
01:52:20,931 --> 01:52:23,559
Somehow

1215
01:52:23,642 --> 01:52:26,979
Someday

1216
01:52:27,062 --> 01:52:30,774
Somewhere

1217
01:53:29,291 --> 01:53:32,294
Baby John,
what are ya doin' here?

1218
01:53:32,377 --> 01:53:34,254
Nothin'.

1219
01:53:34,338 --> 01:53:36,715
What are ya doin' nothin'
here for? Come on.

1220
01:53:37,758 --> 01:53:40,802
l don't want the guys
to see me, A-rab.

1221
01:53:40,886 --> 01:53:42,930
Why not?

1222
01:53:43,013 --> 01:53:44,973
Well, l'm cryin'.

1223
01:53:46,099 --> 01:53:47,684
You are?

1224
01:53:49,394 --> 01:53:52,564
- What for?
- l don't know.

1225
01:53:52,648 --> 01:53:54,358
Blow your nose.

1226
01:54:03,367 --> 01:54:05,744
Did you get a look
at their faces?

1227
01:54:07,538 --> 01:54:10,332
- Which faces?
- You know.

1228
01:54:10,415 --> 01:54:12,834
At the rumble--
Riff and Bernardo.

1229
01:54:18,632 --> 01:54:20,133
l wish it was yesterday.

1230
01:54:20,217 --> 01:54:22,553
Me too.
l'm scared.

1231
01:54:22,636 --> 01:54:24,721
Cut it out!
You hear me?

1232
01:54:24,805 --> 01:54:26,431
What are we gonna do?

1233
01:54:26,515 --> 01:54:29,142
We're gonna meet the other guys
and form up, that's what.

1234
01:54:29,226 --> 01:54:31,144
Now come on.
Let's go.

1235
01:54:32,104 --> 01:54:34,022
Do you got a handkerchief first?

1236
01:54:34,106 --> 01:54:35,691
What's wrong with your sleeve?

1237
01:55:04,094 --> 01:55:06,889
- Where ya been?
- Where do ya think? The Stork Club?

1238
01:55:06,930 --> 01:55:09,057
- We thought they nabbed you.
- Go on.

1239
01:55:09,141 --> 01:55:12,144
- You didn't see Tony, huh?
- No. Nothin' but coppers.

1240
01:55:12,227 --> 01:55:15,647
- What's wrong with him?
- There's nothin' wrong with him.

1241
01:55:15,731 --> 01:55:17,399
All right, all right.

1242
01:55:17,482 --> 01:55:19,568
- Maybe we oughta go home.
- For what?

1243
01:55:19,610 --> 01:55:21,904
- Bet ya they got him.
- Not Tony.

1244
01:55:21,987 --> 01:55:24,239
He was great.
Huh, Baby John?

1245
01:55:24,281 --> 01:55:27,409
Oh, yeah. He really
come through for the Jets.

1246
01:55:27,451 --> 01:55:29,203
Just like Riff said he--

1247
01:55:31,997 --> 01:55:33,749
Said he would.

1248
01:55:37,920 --> 01:55:40,422
Riff! l want Riff!

1249
01:55:41,798 --> 01:55:43,717
Come on, Graziella.

1250
01:55:45,260 --> 01:55:48,096
Nobody was supposed
to get killed.

1251
01:55:49,473 --> 01:55:51,058
lt just--

1252
01:55:56,480 --> 01:55:59,483
- They're gonna pay.
- Them stinkin' Sharks.

1253
01:55:59,566 --> 01:56:01,151
- Dirty fighting.
- They started it.

1254
01:56:01,235 --> 01:56:02,653
- Why don't we finish it?
- Cool it.

1255
01:56:02,736 --> 01:56:05,155
We gotta show 'em who's on top.
Let's do it now!

1256
01:56:05,239 --> 01:56:07,199
Ain't we had enough?

1257
01:56:07,282 --> 01:56:09,284
What's the matter?
You scared?

1258
01:56:09,368 --> 01:56:11,411
- Who you callin' scared?
- Lay off of him.

1259
01:56:11,495 --> 01:56:13,956
- Mind your own business.
- Don't sound off or l'll hit you.

1260
01:56:14,039 --> 01:56:16,583
- You'll do what?
- Knock it off!

1261
01:56:19,211 --> 01:56:21,505
Shut up down there,
you dirty good-for-nothin's!

1262
01:56:21,588 --> 01:56:23,131
Go home where you belong!

1263
01:56:23,215 --> 01:56:26,051
Who you callin' good-for-nothin',
you loudmouthed crud-head!

1264
01:56:26,134 --> 01:56:29,555
-l'll put this through your stupid face!
-Get inside, all of ya!

1265
01:56:36,311 --> 01:56:39,022
- Shut up!
- l don't take that from nobody!

1266
01:56:39,106 --> 01:56:41,900
Next creep who sounds on me,
the next guy who gets in my craw--

1267
01:56:41,984 --> 01:56:43,485
You'll laugh!

1268
01:56:51,535 --> 01:56:54,413
Now you all better dig this
and dig it good.

1269
01:56:54,496 --> 01:56:57,666
No matter who or what

1270
01:56:57,749 --> 01:56:59,751
man, you show it
and you are dead!

1271
01:57:03,547 --> 01:57:08,051
You are cuttin' a hole in yourselves for
them to stick in a red-hot umbrella...

1272
01:57:08,135 --> 01:57:09,928
and open it wide.

1273
01:57:10,762 --> 01:57:14,183
Man, you wanna get past the cops
when they start asking about tonight?

1274
01:57:15,517 --> 01:57:17,561
You play it cool.

1275
01:57:17,644 --> 01:57:21,648
You wanna live in this lousy world?
Play it cool.

1276
01:57:23,066 --> 01:57:24,693
- l wanna get even!
- Get cool!

1277
01:57:24,776 --> 01:57:26,278
- l wanna bust!
- Bust cool!

1278
01:57:26,361 --> 01:57:28,572
- l wanna go!
- Go cool!

1279
01:57:29,239 --> 01:57:32,743
Boy, boy
Crazy boy

1280
01:57:32,826 --> 01:57:35,412
Get cool, boy

1281
01:57:35,495 --> 01:57:38,749
Got a rocket in your pocket

1282
01:57:38,790 --> 01:57:41,335
Keep cooly cool, boy

1283
01:57:41,418 --> 01:57:44,129
Don't get hot
'Cause, man, you've got

1284
01:57:44,213 --> 01:57:46,131
Some high times ahead

1285
01:57:47,633 --> 01:57:49,134
Take it slow

1286
01:57:49,218 --> 01:57:53,639
And Daddy-O
You can live it up and die in bed

1287
01:57:53,722 --> 01:57:57,017
Boy, boy
Crazy boy

1288
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:59,645
Stay loose, boy

1289
01:57:59,728 --> 01:58:03,190
Breeze it, buzz it
Easy does it

1290
01:58:03,273 --> 01:58:06,026
Turn off the juice, boy

1291
01:58:06,109 --> 01:58:07,528
Go, man, go

1292
01:58:07,611 --> 01:58:10,781
But not like a yo-yo schoolboy

1293
01:58:10,864 --> 01:58:14,493
Just play it cool, boy

1294
01:58:14,576 --> 01:58:18,038
Real cool

1295
01:58:32,261 --> 01:58:34,054
Easy, Action.

1296
01:58:46,984 --> 01:58:49,570
Cool it, A-rab.
Cool it! Cool it!

1297
02:00:09,650 --> 02:00:10,526
Cool!

1298
02:00:10,609 --> 02:00:12,778
- Go!
- Crazy!

1299
02:00:54,611 --> 02:00:57,573
Boy, boy
Crazy boy

1300
02:00:57,656 --> 02:00:59,366
Stay loose, boy

1301
02:01:00,325 --> 02:01:03,203
Breeze it, buzz it
Easy does it

1302
02:01:03,287 --> 02:01:05,747
Turn off the juice, boy

1303
02:01:10,794 --> 02:01:13,589
Just play it cool, boy

1304
02:01:13,630 --> 02:01:15,674
Real cool

1305
02:01:36,153 --> 02:01:37,696
Let's go.

1306
02:02:17,361 --> 02:02:18,779
Where we goin'?

1307
02:02:18,820 --> 02:02:21,907
lf we lay low, the coppers
are gonna smell fish, so we--

1308
02:02:21,990 --> 02:02:24,952
- Hey, buddy boys!
- Aw, go wear a skirt.

1309
02:02:25,035 --> 02:02:27,120
l got scabby knees.
Listen.

1310
02:02:27,204 --> 02:02:31,124
- We act like we got nothin' to hide.
- Suppose they ask about the rumble?

1311
02:02:31,124 --> 02:02:34,503
Supposin' they ask you where's Tony
and what party's lookin' for him...

1312
02:02:34,586 --> 02:02:35,921
with a gun!

1313
02:02:36,004 --> 02:02:37,798
You know somethin'?

1314
02:02:37,881 --> 02:02:40,759
- l know l gotta go get a skirt.
- Come on, Anybodys.

1315
02:02:40,842 --> 02:02:42,803
- What's the freak know?
- Plenty.

1316
02:02:42,886 --> 02:02:46,557
l figured somebody oughta infiltrate
P.R. territory and spy around.

1317
02:02:46,640 --> 02:02:48,600
l'm very large with shadows.

1318
02:02:48,767 --> 02:02:51,645
l can slip in and out of 'em
like wind through a fence.

1319
02:02:51,728 --> 02:02:54,982
- ls she ever makin' the most of it.
- You bet your fat A, l am!

1320
02:02:55,023 --> 02:02:56,984
- Spill it!
- Okay!

1321
02:02:57,025 --> 02:03:01,029
l hear Chino tell the Sharks somethin'
about Tony and Bernardo's sister.

1322
02:03:01,113 --> 02:03:02,698
And then l hear Chino say...

1323
02:03:02,781 --> 02:03:05,492
''lf it's the last thing l do,
l'm gonna get that Polack.''

1324
02:03:05,576 --> 02:03:08,662
And then he pulls out
the bad news.

1325
02:03:08,745 --> 02:03:10,873
- Them P.R.s won't stop.
- Till we stop 'em.

1326
02:03:10,914 --> 02:03:12,457
Hold it!

1327
02:03:12,541 --> 02:03:14,251
Now listen.

1328
02:03:14,334 --> 02:03:17,713
Tony come through for us,
we gotta come through for Tony.

1329
02:03:17,754 --> 02:03:20,340
- We gotta find him before Chino does.
- And burns him.

1330
02:03:20,424 --> 02:03:22,718
You guys cover the river.
Snowboy, the docks.

1331
02:03:22,801 --> 02:03:25,178
- l'll take the back alleys.
- l and Graziella will take the streets.

1332
02:03:25,220 --> 02:03:27,181
- l'll cover the park.
- The schoolyard.

1333
02:03:27,222 --> 02:03:29,600
- Let's go.
- What about me?

1334
02:03:30,809 --> 02:03:32,227
You?

1335
02:03:32,269 --> 02:03:34,855
ln and out of the shadows.
Maybe you'll find Tony in one of 'em.

1336
02:03:34,938 --> 02:03:36,398
Right!

1337
02:03:40,110 --> 02:03:41,737
Ya done good, buddy boy.

1338
02:03:43,030 --> 02:03:45,365
Thanks, Daddy-O.

1339
02:04:48,929 --> 02:04:50,514
Who is--

1340
02:04:59,982 --> 02:05:02,818
Maria, it's Anita.
Are you in there?

1341
02:05:05,529 --> 02:05:07,823
Open the door.
l need you.

1342
02:05:15,998 --> 02:05:17,666
Now you are afraid, too?

1343
02:05:17,749 --> 02:05:20,627
- What?
- l'll be right there.

1344
02:05:26,592 --> 02:05:29,136
- Together.
- But where?

1345
02:05:30,345 --> 02:05:33,265
The bus station. We'll go so far away
they'll never find us.

1346
02:05:33,348 --> 02:05:36,226
- How can we?
- Doc'll help us with money.

1347
02:05:36,268 --> 02:05:38,604
- You'll meet me at his store.
- At Doc's, yes.

1348
02:05:38,687 --> 02:05:40,647
l'll wait for you there.

1349
02:05:44,109 --> 02:05:45,694
Hurry.

1350
02:05:47,487 --> 02:05:49,406
Coming, Anita.

1351
02:06:15,224 --> 02:06:17,434
All right, now you know.

1352
02:06:17,518 --> 02:06:21,271
And you still don't know.
He is one of them!

1353
02:06:25,651 --> 02:06:28,529
A boy like that
would kill your brother

1354
02:06:28,612 --> 02:06:31,448
Forget that boy
and find another

1355
02:06:31,490 --> 02:06:35,160
One of your own kind
Stick to your own kind

1356
02:06:39,790 --> 02:06:42,626
A boy like that
will give you sorrow

1357
02:06:42,709 --> 02:06:45,420
You'll meet another boy tomorrow

1358
02:06:45,504 --> 02:06:49,341
One of your own kind
Stick to your own kind

1359
02:06:51,301 --> 02:06:54,096
A boy who kills cannot love

1360
02:06:54,179 --> 02:06:56,723
A boy who kills has no heart

1361
02:06:56,807 --> 02:06:58,976
And he's the boy
who gets your love

1362
02:06:59,059 --> 02:07:00,978
And gets your heart

1363
02:07:01,061 --> 02:07:04,815
Very smart, Maria
Very smart

1364
02:07:08,735 --> 02:07:11,488
A boy like that
wants one thing only

1365
02:07:11,572 --> 02:07:14,533
And when he's done
he'll leave you lonely

1366
02:07:14,575 --> 02:07:17,786
He'll murder your love
He murdered mine

1367
02:07:17,828 --> 02:07:21,498
Just wait and see
Just wait, Maria

1368
02:07:21,582 --> 02:07:24,710
Oh, no, Anita, no

1369
02:07:28,297 --> 02:07:30,883
lt isn't true
Not for me

1370
02:07:30,924 --> 02:07:33,385
lt's true for you
Not for me

1371
02:07:33,468 --> 02:07:37,639
l hear your words
And in my head l know they're smart

1372
02:07:37,723 --> 02:07:41,852
But my heart, Anita
But my heart

1373
02:07:41,935 --> 02:07:44,313
Knows they're wrong

1374
02:07:44,396 --> 02:07:46,982
You should know better

1375
02:07:47,024 --> 02:07:50,194
You were in love
Or so you said

1376
02:07:51,278 --> 02:07:56,158
You should know better

1377
02:08:04,249 --> 02:08:08,170
l have a love

1378
02:08:08,253 --> 02:08:12,633
And it's all that l have

1379
02:08:12,716 --> 02:08:15,093
Right or wrong

1380
02:08:15,177 --> 02:08:19,681
What else can l do

1381
02:08:20,849 --> 02:08:24,061
l love him

1382
02:08:24,144 --> 02:08:26,480
l'm his

1383
02:08:26,563 --> 02:08:32,319
And everything he is

1384
02:08:32,402 --> 02:08:35,822
l am too

1385
02:08:39,159 --> 02:08:43,038
l have a love

1386
02:08:43,121 --> 02:08:47,918
And it's all that l need

1387
02:08:48,001 --> 02:08:50,170
Right or wrong

1388
02:08:50,212 --> 02:08:54,258
And he needs me too

1389
02:08:56,301 --> 02:08:59,805
l love him

1390
02:08:59,888 --> 02:09:02,474
We're one

1391
02:09:02,474 --> 02:09:08,313
There's nothing to be done

1392
02:09:08,397 --> 02:09:13,235
Not a thing l can do

1393
02:09:13,318 --> 02:09:15,696
But hold him

1394
02:09:15,779 --> 02:09:20,409
Hold him forever

1395
02:09:20,492 --> 02:09:23,328
Be with him now

1396
02:09:23,412 --> 02:09:25,831
Tomorrow

1397
02:09:25,873 --> 02:09:30,294
And all

1398
02:09:30,377 --> 02:09:35,799
Of my life

1399
02:09:49,479 --> 02:09:55,611
When love comes so strong

1400
02:09:55,694 --> 02:10:01,533
There is no right or wrong

1401
02:10:01,617 --> 02:10:07,456
Your love is

1402
02:10:07,497 --> 02:10:12,127
Your love

1403
02:10:27,851 --> 02:10:29,978
Chino has a gun.

1404
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:33,440
l heard the boys talking.
He's hunting for Tony.

1405
02:10:33,482 --> 02:10:36,443
He is at Doc's store,
waiting for me.

1406
02:10:36,485 --> 02:10:39,863
lf Chino hurts him or touches him,
l swear to you l'll--

1407
02:10:39,947 --> 02:10:42,074
You'll do what Tony
did to Bernardo?

1408
02:10:42,157 --> 02:10:44,034
l love Tony.

1409
02:10:44,117 --> 02:10:45,661
l know.

1410
02:10:46,828 --> 02:10:48,830
l loved Bernardo.

1411
02:10:56,713 --> 02:10:58,799
- Anybody home?
- Yes.

1412
02:11:00,676 --> 02:11:04,263
- Bernardo's sister, please.
- She isn't feeling well.

1413
02:11:04,346 --> 02:11:06,098
Who is?

1414
02:11:08,767 --> 02:11:11,979
Hello, Miss.
l'm Lieutenant Schrank.

1415
02:11:12,020 --> 02:11:13,981
l don't like to disturb you
at a time like this--

1416
02:11:14,022 --> 02:11:16,316
Yes, a very bad time.

1417
02:11:16,400 --> 02:11:18,944
- lf you will excuse me, please.
- l have a couple of questions.

1418
02:11:19,027 --> 02:11:22,698
Afterwards, please.
l must go to my brother now.

1419
02:11:22,739 --> 02:11:24,908
- Just one minute!
- Can't you wait?

1420
02:11:27,536 --> 02:11:30,372
Now, you were at the dance
at the gym last night--

1421
02:11:30,255 --> 02:11:32,174
Will this take very long?

1422
02:11:32,257 --> 02:11:34,301
As long as it has to.

1423
02:11:35,219 --> 02:11:36,762
Excuse me.

1424
02:11:37,846 --> 02:11:40,099
Anita, my headache is much worse.

1425
02:11:40,182 --> 02:11:42,142
Will you go to
Doc's store for me?

1426
02:11:42,226 --> 02:11:44,144
Don't you people
keep aspirin around?

1427
02:11:44,228 --> 02:11:46,605
This is something special.

1428
02:11:48,273 --> 02:11:50,275
Will you go for me, Anita?

1429
02:11:55,864 --> 02:11:57,783
What shall l ask for?

1430
02:11:58,867 --> 02:12:00,953
Doc will know.

1431
02:12:01,036 --> 02:12:02,705
Tell him l have been detained...

1432
02:12:02,788 --> 02:12:04,665
and can't get there right away.

1433
02:12:06,166 --> 02:12:08,544
Or l would have
picked it up myself.

1434
02:12:19,430 --> 02:12:22,016
Excuse me.
You were asking?

1435
02:12:25,602 --> 02:12:27,271
At the gym last night...

1436
02:12:27,313 --> 02:12:30,649
your brother got into an argument
because you danced with the wrong boy.

1437
02:12:34,903 --> 02:12:36,822
Who was the boy?

1438
02:12:37,781 --> 02:12:40,451
Another from my country.

1439
02:12:40,534 --> 02:12:41,994
And his name?

1440
02:12:42,995 --> 02:12:44,455
Jose.

1441
02:12:54,006 --> 02:12:55,632
- Can't find him.
- He ain't nowhere.

1442
02:12:55,716 --> 02:12:58,218
- He's right down in the cellar.
- Safe and sound.

1443
02:12:58,302 --> 02:13:00,679
- l found him.
- You warn him about Chino?

1444
02:13:00,763 --> 02:13:03,640
- What's he doin' in the cellar?
- Keepin' the mice company.

1445
02:13:04,433 --> 02:13:05,851
No sign of Chino?

1446
02:13:05,934 --> 02:13:08,020
- Nothin'.
- His luck.

1447
02:13:08,103 --> 02:13:10,022
l'll slip out the back
and check the alleys again.

1448
02:13:10,105 --> 02:13:12,191
- You guys hang here.
- Right.

1449
02:13:12,274 --> 02:13:14,193
Boy, l'm thirsty.
Where's Doc?

1450
02:13:14,276 --> 02:13:16,779
Upstairs raisin'
getaway money for Tony.

1451
02:13:16,862 --> 02:13:19,156
- Doc ain't got no money.
- His mattress has.

1452
02:13:19,239 --> 02:13:23,202
Cut the frabbajabba.
Grab some readin' matter. Play the juke.

1453
02:13:23,243 --> 02:13:26,664
Some of you get outside. lf you see
Chino or any of those stinkin' P.R.s--

1454
02:13:38,467 --> 02:13:41,053
- l'd like to see Doc.
- He ain't here.

1455
02:13:41,887 --> 02:13:43,138
Where is he?

1456
02:13:43,180 --> 02:13:45,933
He went to the bank.
They made a mistake in his favor.

1457
02:13:46,016 --> 02:13:49,144
The banks are closed at night.
Where is he?

1458
02:13:49,228 --> 02:13:52,773
You know how skinny Doc is. He slipped
in through the night deposit slot.

1459
02:13:52,856 --> 02:13:55,484
And got stuck halfway in.

1460
02:13:55,567 --> 02:13:58,988
Which indicates, there's
no tellin' when he'll be back.

1461
02:14:12,960 --> 02:14:15,004
Where ya goin'?

1462
02:14:15,087 --> 02:14:16,505
Downstairs.

1463
02:14:16,588 --> 02:14:19,174
Didn't l tell you?
He ain't here!

1464
02:14:19,258 --> 02:14:21,593
l'd like to see for myself.

1465
02:14:24,013 --> 02:14:25,973
Please.

1466
02:14:34,064 --> 02:14:37,735
- Will you let me pass?
- She's too dark to pass.

1467
02:14:37,776 --> 02:14:39,737
- Oh, don't.
- Please don't.

1468
02:14:43,407 --> 02:14:45,659
- Listen, you!
- We're listenin'!

1469
02:14:45,743 --> 02:14:48,996
Look. l gotta give
a friend of yours a message.

1470
02:14:49,079 --> 02:14:50,748
- l gotta tell Tony--
- He ain't here.

1471
02:14:50,831 --> 02:14:52,333
- l know he is.
- Who says?

1472
02:14:52,416 --> 02:14:53,792
- Who's the message from?
- Never mind.

1473
02:14:53,876 --> 02:14:55,502
Couldn't be from Chino,
could it?

1474
02:14:55,586 --> 02:14:59,340
Don't you understand?
l want to help!

1475
02:14:59,381 --> 02:15:03,093
- Bernardo's girl wants to help?
- Even a greaseball's got feelin's.

1476
02:15:03,177 --> 02:15:05,095
But she wants to help get Tony.

1477
02:15:05,179 --> 02:15:07,848
Not much,
Bernardo's tramp.

1478
02:15:07,931 --> 02:15:10,100
- Bernardo's pig.
- You lyin' spic.

1479
02:15:10,142 --> 02:15:11,852
- Don't do that!
- Gold tooth!

1480
02:15:11,935 --> 02:15:14,730
- Pierced ear!
- Garlic mouth!

1481
02:15:50,391 --> 02:15:51,934
Stop it!

1482
02:15:56,730 --> 02:15:59,191
What are you doing there?

1483
02:16:18,127 --> 02:16:20,254
Bernardo was right.

1484
02:16:22,297 --> 02:16:26,051
lf one of you was
lying in the street...

1485
02:16:26,135 --> 02:16:27,594
bleeding...

1486
02:16:27,636 --> 02:16:30,264
l'd walk by and spit on you.

1487
02:16:30,347 --> 02:16:32,558
-Don't let her go!
-She'll tell Chino Tony's in the cellar!

1488
02:16:32,641 --> 02:16:34,601
Don't you touch me.

1489
02:16:37,646 --> 02:16:41,567
l got a message
for your American buddy.

1490
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:43,569
You tell that murderer...

1491
02:16:43,652 --> 02:16:46,280
that Maria's
never going to meet him.

1492
02:16:46,363 --> 02:16:50,200
You tell him that Chino
found out about them...

1493
02:16:50,284 --> 02:16:52,077
and shot her!

1494
02:16:53,120 --> 02:16:54,872
She's dead.

1495
02:16:59,001 --> 02:17:02,129
When do you kids stop?

1496
02:17:02,171 --> 02:17:05,799
You make this world lousy.

1497
02:17:05,883 --> 02:17:07,968
We didn't make it, Doc.

1498
02:17:09,803 --> 02:17:11,847
Get outta here.

1499
02:17:43,712 --> 02:17:46,465
Doc, l thought l heard--
You got it!

1500
02:17:46,548 --> 02:17:49,051
Yeah, l got it.

1501
02:17:49,134 --> 02:17:52,304
You're a pal.
You're the best friend a guy ever had.

1502
02:17:52,388 --> 02:17:54,932
l'll pay you back
as soon as l can, l promise.

1503
02:17:54,974 --> 02:17:58,060
- Forget that.
- Never. l couldn't.

1504
02:17:58,143 --> 02:18:01,355
Doc, you know what we're gonna do
in the country, Maria and me?

1505
02:18:01,438 --> 02:18:04,108
We're gonna have lots of kids,
and we're gonna name 'em after ya.

1506
02:18:04,191 --> 02:18:06,193
That way,
when you come to visit us--

1507
02:18:06,276 --> 02:18:07,653
Wake up!

1508
02:18:08,654 --> 02:18:12,116
ls this the only way
to get through to you?

1509
02:18:12,199 --> 02:18:16,453
Do just what you all do?
Bust like a hot water pipe?

1510
02:18:16,495 --> 02:18:17,997
What's got into you?

1511
02:18:18,080 --> 02:18:21,709
Why do you kids live
like there's a war on?

1512
02:18:26,088 --> 02:18:28,007
Why do you kill?

1513
02:18:31,760 --> 02:18:34,013
l told you how it happened.

1514
02:18:35,264 --> 02:18:37,474
Maria understands.

1515
02:18:37,558 --> 02:18:39,268
l thought you did too.

1516
02:18:39,351 --> 02:18:42,563
Maria understands nothing...

1517
02:18:42,646 --> 02:18:44,356
ever again.

1518
02:18:44,440 --> 02:18:46,859
There is no Maria, Tony.

1519
02:18:50,654 --> 02:18:51,572
What?

1520
02:18:53,407 --> 02:18:56,285
- l can't.
- No, Doc!

1521
02:18:56,327 --> 02:18:58,620
Now tell me!
What is it?

1522
02:18:59,663 --> 02:19:02,708
That was Anita upstairs.

1523
02:19:02,791 --> 02:19:05,919
Chino found out
about you and Maria...

1524
02:19:07,171 --> 02:19:09,298
and he killed her.

1525
02:19:32,488 --> 02:19:34,406
Maria died?

1526
02:19:48,754 --> 02:19:51,590
Come and get me too, Chino!

1527
02:20:05,312 --> 02:20:07,815
Come and get me too, Chino!

1528
02:20:07,898 --> 02:20:09,900
- Who's that?
- lt's Anybodys. Come on.

1529
02:20:09,984 --> 02:20:11,902
Get out of here!

1530
02:20:13,112 --> 02:20:15,572
- Come and get me, damn you!
- What are ya doin'?

1531
02:20:15,656 --> 02:20:19,326
- Get out of here!
- Why don't you come with me--

1532
02:20:19,368 --> 02:20:21,912
lt ain't playin' anymore!
Can't any of you get that?

1533
02:20:21,996 --> 02:20:24,081
- But the gang!
- You're a girl!

1534
02:20:24,164 --> 02:20:26,125
Be a girl and beat it!

1535
02:20:32,881 --> 02:20:36,176
Come on, Chino!
Get me too!

1536
02:20:49,815 --> 02:20:52,484
Chino! l'm callin' for ya!

1537
02:20:53,986 --> 02:20:56,155
There's nobody here but me.

1538
02:20:56,196 --> 02:20:58,198
Come on!

1539
02:20:58,282 --> 02:21:00,326
Please, will ya?

1540
02:21:01,785 --> 02:21:04,288
l'm waitin' for ya.

1541
02:21:04,371 --> 02:21:06,290
l want you to.

1542
02:22:02,096 --> 02:22:05,015
l didn't believe hard enough.

1543
02:22:05,057 --> 02:22:07,434
Loving is enough.

1544
02:22:07,518 --> 02:22:11,855
Not here.
They won't let us be.

1545
02:22:12,690 --> 02:22:14,817
Then we'll get away.

1546
02:22:18,070 --> 02:22:20,906
- Yeah, we can.
- Yes.

1547
02:22:20,990 --> 02:22:23,283
- We will.
- Yes.

1548
02:22:24,368 --> 02:22:28,998
Hold my hand
and we're halfway there

1549
02:22:32,084 --> 02:22:38,382
Hold my hand
and l'll take you there

1550
02:22:38,424 --> 02:22:40,384
Somehow

1551
02:22:40,426 --> 02:22:42,553
Someday

1552
02:22:43,637 --> 02:22:45,264
Some--

1553
02:23:26,096 --> 02:23:27,431
Stay back!

1554
02:23:48,410 --> 02:23:51,372
How do you fire this gun, Chino?

1555
02:23:51,455 --> 02:23:53,040
Just by pulling
this little trigger?

1556
02:23:54,833 --> 02:23:57,920
How many bullets are left, Chino?

1557
02:23:58,003 --> 02:23:59,713
Enough for you?

1558
02:23:59,797 --> 02:24:01,507
And you?

1559
02:24:02,549 --> 02:24:03,967
All of you!

1560
02:24:04,051 --> 02:24:05,761
You all killed him.

1561
02:24:05,844 --> 02:24:08,347
And my brother.
And Riff.

1562
02:24:08,389 --> 02:24:10,975
Not with bullets and guns.

1563
02:24:11,058 --> 02:24:13,519
With hate!

1564
02:24:13,602 --> 02:24:17,648
Well, l can kill too,
because now l have hate!

1565
02:24:17,731 --> 02:24:19,692
