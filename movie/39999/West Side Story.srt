00:07:18,456 --> 00:07:21,391
Watch this shot now!
Shoot, man! Go!

2
00:10:02,419 --> 00:10:06,185
-Hey, chickie! Chick, chick, chick!
-Boy! Jet boy!

3
00:10:06,357 --> 00:10:08,188
Hey, Jet boy!

4
00:10:18,669 --> 00:10:19,761
Jet, Jet, Jets!

5
00:10:21,572 --> 00:10:24,632
-Come back!
-Chickens!

6
00:10:37,988 --> 00:10:39,785
Beat it!

7
00:10:55,072 --> 00:10:57,700
All right, go, Jets.
Get on it.

8
00:11:01,278 --> 00:11:03,041
Snowboy!

9
00:11:13,123 --> 00:11:14,988
Come on.

10
00:11:23,133 --> 00:11:24,998
Beat it!

11
00:11:37,247 --> 00:11:39,909
Okay, here we go!

12
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:16,381
Jets! Hey, Jets!

13
00:12:21,859 --> 00:12:24,760
Bernardo! Indio!
Let's chuck them, come on!

14
00:12:30,567 --> 00:12:34,731
Jets, come on! Follow me, baby.

15
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,822
Come on, Jets, come on!

16
00:13:00,998 --> 00:13:04,331
Hey, Jets!
Hello!

17
00:13:07,838 --> 00:13:11,740
Jets, come on! JuIio!
Come on!

18
00:13:20,684 --> 00:13:22,845
Come on, boys.

19
00:13:23,587 --> 00:13:25,919
Come on, now.

20
00:14:11,635 --> 00:14:13,728
Jets!

21
00:14:47,104 --> 00:14:51,734
Break it up, you punks! Cut it out!
Come on, break it up, I said!

22
00:14:51,909 --> 00:14:56,676
Break it up! How many times have I
toId you punks to cut this stuff out?

23
00:14:56,847 --> 00:15:00,715
-Why, if it ain't Lt. Schrank!
-Top of the day, Lt. Schrank.

24
00:15:00,884 --> 00:15:04,285
-And Officer Krupke.
-Top of the day, Officer Krupke.

25
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:07,651
-I'll give you the top of the head.
-You, get down!

26
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:10,520
-We're having fun.
-We enjoy the pIayground.

27
00:15:10,694 --> 00:15:13,629
It keeps us deprived chiIdren
off the streets.

28
00:15:13,797 --> 00:15:16,766
-Shut up!
-Born Iike we was on the hot pavement.

29
00:15:16,934 --> 00:15:21,735
-You wanna get your skull broke?
-Baby John, come here. Come here!

30
00:15:25,776 --> 00:15:30,179
All right. Now, which one of these
Puerto Ricans bIoodied you?

31
00:15:31,248 --> 00:15:33,773
-Well, sir--
-Which one?

32
00:15:33,951 --> 00:15:35,441
Excuse me, sir.

33
00:15:35,619 --> 00:15:37,484
As a matter of fact...

34
00:15:37,654 --> 00:15:40,817
...we suspicion that the job
was done by a cop.

35
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:42,925
-Two cops.
-At the very Ieast.

36
00:15:43,093 --> 00:15:47,826
-ImpossibIe.
-In America, nothing is impossibIe.

37
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:51,399
All right, wise guys.
Now, you Iisten to me!

38
00:15:51,568 --> 00:15:55,470
All of you! You hoodIums
don't own these streets.

39
00:15:55,639 --> 00:15:59,405
I've had all the roughhouse
I'll put up with around here!

40
00:15:59,576 --> 00:16:03,808
You wanna kill each other,
kill each other! But not on my beat!

41
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:06,609
-Are there any questions?
-Yes, sir.

42
00:16:06,783 --> 00:16:10,184
WouId you mind transIating
that into Spanish?

43
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:15,357
Get your friends
out of here, Bernardo.

44
00:16:15,692 --> 00:16:17,887
And stay out.

45
00:16:22,599 --> 00:16:24,430
PIease.

46
00:16:26,169 --> 00:16:28,467
Okay, Sharks.

47
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:45,219
Boy, oh, boy. As if this neighborhood
wasn't crummy enough.

48
00:16:46,890 --> 00:16:51,054
Now, Iook, fellas. Fellas!
Look, Iet's be reasonabIe, huh?

49
00:16:51,228 --> 00:16:53,719
If I don't get Iaw and order
around here...

50
00:16:53,897 --> 00:16:56,422
...I get busted down
to a traffic corner.

51
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,659
Your friend don't Iike traffic corners.

52
00:16:59,069 --> 00:17:04,302
So that means you're gonna start
making nice with the PRs from now on.

53
00:17:04,674 --> 00:17:07,199
I said nice! Get it?

54
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:09,274
Because if you don't...

55
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:13,473
...and I catch any of you doing
any more brawIing in my territory...

56
00:17:13,650 --> 00:17:19,054
...I'll beat every one of you and see
you go to the can and rot there!

57
00:17:22,025 --> 00:17:27,429
-Say goodbye to the nice boys, Krupke.
-Goodbye, boys.

58
00:17:30,534 --> 00:17:33,059
''Goodbye, boys.''

59
00:17:33,236 --> 00:17:37,332
-JaiI? Gee.
-''You hoodIums don't own the streets.''

60
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:39,839
-''PIay in the park.''
-''Keep off the grass.''

61
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:41,910
-''Leave the house!''
-''Off the bIock.''

62
00:17:42,079 --> 00:17:43,910
-''Get out of here.''
-''Off the worId!''

63
00:17:44,081 --> 00:17:46,709
A gang that don't own
the street is nothing!

64
00:17:46,883 --> 00:17:48,441
We do own it!

65
00:17:49,486 --> 00:17:51,386
Come on, Jets, round up!

66
00:17:51,955 --> 00:17:55,618
-Not you, Anybodys! Beat it!
-Riff, Iet me in the gang!

67
00:17:55,792 --> 00:17:59,592
Didn't you see me? I was smash!
I'm a killer, I wanna fight.

68
00:17:59,763 --> 00:18:02,323
How eIse will she get
a guy to touch her?

69
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:05,662
-You dirty rat!
-The road, IittIe girI! The road!

70
00:18:05,836 --> 00:18:06,825
Beat it!

71
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:11,803
-Beat it!
-Okay, come on.

72
00:18:17,247 --> 00:18:22,207
Now, we fought hard for this turf,
and we ain't just gonna give it up.

73
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:27,345
The EmeraIds cIaimed it and got shut out.
The Hawks tried taking it and faiIed.

74
00:18:27,524 --> 00:18:30,322
-But these PRs are different.
-They muItiply.

75
00:18:30,494 --> 00:18:33,691
-They're eating all the food.
-Breathing all the air.

76
00:18:33,864 --> 00:18:37,823
-HeIp! I'm drowning in tamaIe.
-You heard what Lt. Schrank said:

77
00:18:38,001 --> 00:18:41,198
We gotta make nice
with them Puerto Ricans or eIse.

78
00:18:41,371 --> 00:18:45,899
Let them move in under our noses
and take it all away from us or eIse.

79
00:18:46,076 --> 00:18:47,941
You're damn right, no!

80
00:18:48,111 --> 00:18:52,207
So, what are we gonna do, buddy boys?
I'll tell you what we'll do.

81
00:18:52,382 --> 00:18:54,009
We're gonna speed fast!

82
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:58,780
We're gonna move Iike Iightning and
cIean them Sharks up once and for all.

83
00:18:58,955 --> 00:19:02,516
So they ain't never gonna
set foot on our turf again!

84
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:06,287
And we're gonna do it
in one all-out fight.

85
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:09,489
-A rumbIe!
-Now cooI, Action boy.

86
00:19:09,666 --> 00:19:14,831
The Sharks want a piece of this
worId too. And they're reaI down boys.

87
00:19:15,005 --> 00:19:18,202
They might ask for bIades, zip guns.

88
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:20,969
Zip guns? Well, gee.

89
00:19:21,144 --> 00:19:24,511
I ain't finaIizing and saying
they will, Baby John.

90
00:19:24,681 --> 00:19:30,017
I'm just saying that they might,
and we gotta be prepared.

91
00:19:30,187 --> 00:19:32,052
Now, what's your mood, Jets?

92
00:19:32,222 --> 00:19:34,315
-I say go, go!
-I say mix!

93
00:19:34,491 --> 00:19:35,924
-Sock 'em!
-Tear 'em!

94
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:40,791
-But if they say bIades or guns....
-Let's just forget the whoIe thing.

95
00:19:40,964 --> 00:19:43,125
-What?
-What do you say, Riff?

96
00:19:44,167 --> 00:19:48,228
I say this turf is small,
but it's all we got.

97
00:19:48,405 --> 00:19:49,633
That's for sure.

98
00:19:49,806 --> 00:19:53,606
I wanna hoId it Iike
we aIways heId it, with skin!

99
00:19:54,511 --> 00:19:57,810
But if they say bIades, I say bIades.

100
00:19:57,981 --> 00:20:00,950
If they say guns, I say guns.

101
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:04,177
I say I want the Jets
to be the number one!

102
00:20:04,354 --> 00:20:08,347
-To saiI! To hoId the sky!
-Then rev us off!

103
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,891
Okay, cats, we rumbIe!

104
00:20:12,062 --> 00:20:17,557
Now, protocaIity calls for a war counciI
between us and the Sharks to set it up.

105
00:20:17,734 --> 00:20:20,931
So I will personally give
the bad news to Bernardo.

106
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:23,004
-Take a Iieutenant.
-That's me.

107
00:20:23,173 --> 00:20:24,970
-That's Tony.
-Who needs Tony?

108
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:29,009
We need Tony! He's got a rep
bigger than the whoIe West Side!

109
00:20:29,346 --> 00:20:32,747
-He don't beIong no more.
-Now, cut it, Action!

110
00:20:32,916 --> 00:20:35,885
-Me and Tony started the Jets.
-So where is he?

111
00:20:36,052 --> 00:20:39,544
-How come he has a Iousy job?
-Youth Board corrupted him.

112
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:44,126
-Temporary sickness! Wait and see.
-Remember when we beat the EmeraIds?

113
00:20:44,294 --> 00:20:47,024
-He saved my neck!
-He'll do it again too!

114
00:20:47,197 --> 00:20:50,462
He aIways came through for us
and he aIways will.

115
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:53,432
<i>When you're a Jet
You're a Jet all the way</i>

I know you can count him in.

127
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:33,341
-Let's go.
-Where will you find Bernardo?

128
00:21:33,510 --> 00:21:36,274
-It ain't safe in PR territory.
-At the dance.

129
00:21:36,446 --> 00:21:39,540
-But the gym's neutraI territory.
-I'll make nice.

130
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:42,184
-I'll only challenge him.
-Right, daddy-o.

131
00:21:42,352 --> 00:21:45,150
Listen, everybody dress up
sweet and sharp.

00:22:34,804 --> 00:22:37,432
<i>Here come the Jets
And we're gonna beat</i>

150
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:41,008
<i>Every last buggin' gang
On the whole buggin' street</i>

151
00:22:41,177 --> 00:22:45,614
<i>On the whole buggin'
Ever-lovin' street</i>

152
00:22:51,321 --> 00:22:54,313
-Tony, you're not Iistening.
-I read you Ioud and cIear.

153
00:22:54,491 --> 00:22:57,585
-Say something.
-I don't wanna hurt your feeIings.

154
00:22:57,761 --> 00:23:01,094
-You're my buddy, paI, best friend!
-Womb to tomb?

155
00:23:01,931 --> 00:23:03,193
Birth to earth.

156
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:07,530
That's why you gotta come to the dance
and stand up with me.

157
00:23:07,704 --> 00:23:09,729
Come on, Tony. Just say yes.

158
00:23:09,906 --> 00:23:16,004
Did you ever stop to figure out how many
bubbIes there are in this bottIe of soda?

159
00:23:16,179 --> 00:23:19,910
-Tony, this is important!
-Everything's important, Riff.

160
00:23:20,083 --> 00:23:22,779
You, me, the sweet guy I work for.

161
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:25,678
The Sharks waIk bad. They bite hard.

162
00:23:25,855 --> 00:23:29,347
-And if we don't stop them now--
-Here! Work for a Iiving.

163
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:33,622
How do you Iike that? For years
I Iive with a buddy and his family.

164
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:36,891
I think I'm digging a guy's character.

165
00:23:37,066 --> 00:23:42,527
-Am I a victim of disappointment in you!
-End your suffering, IittIe man.

166
00:23:42,705 --> 00:23:45,936
Why not just pack up your gear
and move out?

167
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:48,236
'Cause your ma's hot for me.

168
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,575
No! It's because I hate Iiving
with my bugging uncIe!

169
00:23:54,751 --> 00:23:57,185
-Come on!
-UncIe! Come on, uncIe!

170
00:23:58,388 --> 00:24:04,486
-Now, go pIay games with the Jets.
-And why not? They're the greatest.

171
00:24:04,661 --> 00:24:05,992
Ain't they?

172
00:24:06,162 --> 00:24:08,153
Were.

173
00:24:08,565 --> 00:24:11,966
''Were''?
You found something better?

174
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:15,332
No. Not yet, but....

175
00:24:15,505 --> 00:24:17,439
But what?

176
00:24:18,408 --> 00:24:20,501
You won't dig it, Riff.

177
00:24:20,677 --> 00:24:22,804
So try me.

178
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:25,637
Come on, Tony. Try me.

179
00:24:28,751 --> 00:24:29,945
Okay.

180
00:24:33,356 --> 00:24:37,417
Every singIe night for the Iast month,
I wake up...

181
00:24:37,594 --> 00:24:39,562
...and I'm reaching out.

182
00:24:40,864 --> 00:24:44,391
-For what?
-I don't know.

183
00:24:44,567 --> 00:24:45,864
A dame?

184
00:24:46,903 --> 00:24:50,304
It's right outside the door,
just around the corner...

185
00:24:50,473 --> 00:24:51,701
...but it's coming.

186
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,740
What is?

187
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:59,982
I don't know. It's Iike the kick
I used to get from being a Jet.

188
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:03,812
Now you're taIking!
Man, without a gang, you're an orphan.

189
00:25:03,987 --> 00:25:06,387
With a gang, you waIk
in twos, threes, fours.

190
00:25:06,556 --> 00:25:09,423
When your crew is the best,
when you're a Jet...

191
00:25:09,592 --> 00:25:12,254
...you're out in the sun,
you're home free!

192
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:14,692
Riff, I've had it!

193
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,695
Tony.

194
00:25:19,969 --> 00:25:23,336
-Look at me, will you? Come on.
-I'm Iooking at you.

195
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:28,136
Now, I never asked the time of day
from a cIock, did I?

196
00:25:28,311 --> 00:25:32,145
I never asked nothing from nobody,
but I'm asking you.

197
00:25:32,315 --> 00:25:34,681
Come to the dance tonight.

198
00:25:35,218 --> 00:25:39,985
-I promised Doc I'd cIean the store.
-Then do it after the dance.

199
00:25:40,490 --> 00:25:43,425
Tony, I aIready toId
the guys you'd be there.

200
00:25:43,593 --> 00:25:46,619
If you don't show,
I'll be marked Iousy.

201
00:25:47,697 --> 00:25:50,860
-What time did you tell them?
-1 0.

202
00:25:51,034 --> 00:25:53,832
For me, Tony, for Riff!

203
00:25:56,639 --> 00:25:57,901
1 0 it is.

204
00:25:58,074 --> 00:26:01,009
-Womb to tomb?
-Birth to earth. I'll regret this.

205
00:26:01,177 --> 00:26:04,544
Maybe what you're waiting for
will be twitching at the dance.

206
00:26:04,714 --> 00:26:07,239
Yeah, who knows?

207
00:26:12,021 --> 00:26:14,319
Who knows?

208
00:26:16,059 --> 00:26:19,392
<i>Could be</i>

209
00:26:19,562 --> 00:26:22,360
<i>Who knows?</i>

210
00:26:22,532 --> 00:26:26,161
<i>There's somethin' due any day
I will know right away</i>

211
00:26:26,336 --> 00:26:29,396
<i>Soon as it shows</i>

212
00:26:29,572 --> 00:26:31,403
<i>It may come cannonballin'
Down through the sky</i>

213
00:26:31,574 --> 00:26:35,408
<i>Gleam in its eye
Bright as a rose</i>

214
00:26:35,578 --> 00:26:39,036
<i>Who knows?</i>

215
00:26:39,215 --> 00:26:42,651
<i>It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach</i>

216
00:26:42,819 --> 00:26:45,788
<i>Under a tree</i>

217
00:26:45,955 --> 00:26:51,120
<i>I got a feelin' there's a miracle due
Gonna come true, comin' to me</i>

218
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:56,693
<i>Could it be?
Yes, it could</i>

219
00:26:56,866 --> 00:27:01,860
<i>Something's comin', somethin' good
If I can wait</i>

220
00:27:02,038 --> 00:27:05,166
<i>Something's comin'
I don't know what it is</i>

221
00:27:05,341 --> 00:27:09,141
<i>But it is gonna be great</i>

222
00:27:09,312 --> 00:27:11,906
<i>With a click
With a shock</i>

223
00:27:12,081 --> 00:27:16,848
<i>Phone'll jingle, door'll knock
Open the latch</i>

224
00:27:17,053 --> 00:27:19,385
<i>Something's comin'
Don't know when</i>

225
00:27:19,555 --> 00:27:24,049
<i>But it's soon, catch the moon
One-handed catch</i>

226
00:27:24,293 --> 00:27:29,162
<i>Around the corner</i>

227
00:27:29,332 --> 00:27:34,599
<i>Or whistlin' down the river</i>

228
00:27:34,771 --> 00:27:39,606
<i>Come on, deliver</i>

229
00:27:39,776 --> 00:27:45,112
<i>To me</i>

230
00:27:45,548 --> 00:27:47,880
<i>Will it be?
Yes, it will</i>

231
00:27:48,051 --> 00:27:53,250
<i>Maybe just by holdin' still
It'll be there</i>

232
00:27:53,456 --> 00:27:55,447
<i>Come on, somethin'
Come on in</i>

233
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:57,320
<i>Don't be shy
Meet a guy</i>

234
00:27:57,493 --> 00:28:00,394
<i>Pull up a chair</i>

235
00:28:00,563 --> 00:28:05,762
<i>The air is hummin'</i>

236
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:10,565
<i>And somethin' great is comin'</i>

237
00:28:11,874 --> 00:28:15,310
<i>Who knows?</i>

238
00:28:15,478 --> 00:28:18,970
<i>It's only just out of reach
Down the block, on a beach</i>

239
00:28:19,148 --> 00:28:22,140
<i>Maybe tonight</i>

240
00:28:22,318 --> 00:28:25,151
<i>Maybe tonight</i>

241
00:28:25,421 --> 00:28:30,825
<i>Maybe tonight</i>

242
00:28:39,502 --> 00:28:42,835
<i>-Por favor, Anita, you are my friend.
-Stop it, Maria.</i>

243
00:28:43,005 --> 00:28:46,702
-You must make the neck Iower.
-And you must stop heckIing me.

244
00:28:46,876 --> 00:28:49,436
We're working on our time now,
not the oId Iady's.

245
00:28:49,612 --> 00:28:52,547
One inch.
How much can one IittIe inch do?

246
00:28:52,715 --> 00:28:54,444
Too much.

247
00:28:54,617 --> 00:28:58,781
Anita, it is now to be a dress
for dancing, no Ionger for praying!

248
00:28:58,955 --> 00:29:03,585
Listen, with those boys, you can
start in dancing and end up praying.

249
00:29:03,760 --> 00:29:06,888
<i>Querida, one IittIe inch.</i>

250
00:29:07,063 --> 00:29:09,725
-Bernardo made me promise!
-Bernardo!

251
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:13,767
One month have I been in this country.
Do I even touch excitement?

252
00:29:13,936 --> 00:29:16,803
I sew in this pIace all day.
I sit at home all night.

253
00:29:16,973 --> 00:29:19,373
For what did my brother bring me here?

254
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:21,976
-To marry Chino.
-Chino.

255
00:29:22,145 --> 00:29:26,605
-When I Iook at Chino, nothing happens.
-What do you expect to happen?

256
00:29:26,816 --> 00:29:30,343
I don't know. Something.

257
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,018
What happens when you Iook
at Bernardo?

258
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:37,421
It's when I don't Iook
that it happens.

259
00:29:40,630 --> 00:29:42,723
I think I'll tell Mama and Papa...

260
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:46,164
...about you and Nardo
in the baIcony of the movies!

261
00:29:46,335 --> 00:29:49,133
-I will rip this to shreds!
-No!

262
00:29:49,338 --> 00:29:52,774
But if you perhaps couId manage
to Iower the neck....

263
00:29:53,709 --> 00:29:56,906
-Next year.
-I hate that dress!

264
00:29:57,079 --> 00:30:00,640
Then don't wear it and
don't come to the dance with us.

265
00:30:00,817 --> 00:30:03,081
Don't come?

266
00:30:05,221 --> 00:30:10,090
-CouId we not dye it red at Ieast?
-No, we couId not.

267
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,722
White is for babies.

268
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:17,559
I will be the only one there in a white--

269
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:31,144
It is a beautifuI dress.

270
00:30:31,347 --> 00:30:33,076
I Iove you!

271
00:30:34,550 --> 00:30:39,044
-Are you ready, Iadies?
-Nardo, come in. Is it not beautifuI?

272
00:30:39,288 --> 00:30:41,222
Yes.

273
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,416
-Very.
-I didn't quite hear.

274
00:30:44,594 --> 00:30:46,960
Very beautifuI.

275
00:30:48,097 --> 00:30:50,190
Come in, Chino. Do not be afraid.

276
00:30:50,366 --> 00:30:55,065
-This is a shop for Iadies.
-We won't bite till we know you better.

277
00:30:55,238 --> 00:31:00,141
Chino, keep both eyes on Maria tonight
in case I cannot. You too, Anita.

278
00:31:00,309 --> 00:31:04,746
-My brother is a silly watchdog.
-My sister is a precious jeweI.

279
00:31:05,915 --> 00:31:09,442
What am I? Cut gIass?

280
00:31:09,619 --> 00:31:14,283
It is most important that I have a
wonderfuI time at the dancing tonight.

281
00:31:14,457 --> 00:31:15,515
It is?

282
00:31:15,691 --> 00:31:18,922
Because tonight is
the reaI beginning of my Iife...

283
00:31:19,095 --> 00:31:22,189
...as a young Iady of America.

284
00:32:25,962 --> 00:32:27,224
Get out of here!

285
00:32:58,894 --> 00:33:01,454
Chino. Chino!

286
00:33:01,864 --> 00:33:05,322
Pepe! Pepe! Come on, guys!

287
00:33:06,268 --> 00:33:09,328
Maria. Maria.

288
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:11,837
Look what I got.

289
00:33:12,008 --> 00:33:14,033
Maria, these are some of my friends
you've not met.

290
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:17,270
-Hey, pick up.
-How are you?

291
00:33:17,513 --> 00:33:18,946
This is Loco.

292
00:33:20,416 --> 00:33:22,145
-Teresita.
-My sister Maria.

293
00:33:22,318 --> 00:33:24,718
-Good evening.
-This is Luis and Rosa.

294
00:33:37,166 --> 00:33:40,761
All right, boys and girIs. All right.

295
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:44,337
Attention, pIease!

296
00:33:45,274 --> 00:33:47,742
Attention!

297
00:33:49,311 --> 00:33:50,903
Come here.

298
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:54,948
Thank you. My, this is a fine turnout
we have here tonight.

299
00:33:55,117 --> 00:33:57,642
It's all for you, gIad hand.

300
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:00,687
I know all of you boys and girIs...

301
00:34:00,856 --> 00:34:04,417
...are here because
you wanna make new friends...

302
00:34:04,593 --> 00:34:06,493
...and get cIoser to oId ones.

303
00:34:06,695 --> 00:34:07,992
Yeah!

304
00:34:08,164 --> 00:34:12,965
So tonight, kids,
we're gonna do something speciaI.

305
00:34:13,135 --> 00:34:15,535
We're gonna have a get-together dance!

306
00:34:15,738 --> 00:34:18,935
Ginger! Peachy!

307
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:22,441
All right, all right, now,
kids, kids...

308
00:34:22,611 --> 00:34:24,841
...I want you to form two circIes.

309
00:34:25,014 --> 00:34:26,276
-How many?
-Two.

310
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:29,441
Boys on the outside
and girIs on the inside.

311
00:34:29,618 --> 00:34:31,313
Where are you?

312
00:34:32,354 --> 00:34:34,015
All right.

313
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,748
Now...

314
00:34:35,925 --> 00:34:38,758
...when the music stops...

315
00:34:38,928 --> 00:34:45,333
...each boy dances with whichever girI
is opposite, okay? Okay!

316
00:34:45,868 --> 00:34:48,359
Two circIes, kids!

317
00:34:51,941 --> 00:34:54,034
Well, it won't hurt you to try.

318
00:34:54,243 --> 00:34:57,144
It hurts. It hurts! It hurts.

319
00:34:57,313 --> 00:34:59,304
Snowboy.

320
00:35:42,691 --> 00:35:45,524
That's it, kids!
Keep the ball rolling.

321
00:35:45,694 --> 00:35:49,892
Round she goes, and where she stops,
nobody knows.

322
00:35:50,065 --> 00:35:52,693
All right, here we go.

323
00:35:54,203 --> 00:35:58,537
Boys to my right and girIs to my Ieft.

324
00:36:28,504 --> 00:36:29,994
-Mambo!
-Mambo!

325
00:36:30,206 --> 00:36:31,901
Go!

326
00:36:47,323 --> 00:36:49,416
Tony!

327
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,599
Mambo!

328
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,986
Mambo!

329
00:40:29,278 --> 00:40:31,974
You're not thinking I'm someone eIse?

330
00:40:32,815 --> 00:40:35,147
I know you are not.

331
00:40:38,754 --> 00:40:41,723
Or that we've met before?

332
00:40:41,890 --> 00:40:44,017
I know we have not.

333
00:40:44,993 --> 00:40:46,620
I feIt....

334
00:40:46,795 --> 00:40:50,856
I knew something never before
was gonna happen, had to happen...

335
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:54,628
-...but this is so much more.
-My hands are coId.

336
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,800
Yours too.

337
00:41:07,282 --> 00:41:09,773
So warm.

338
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:16,822
So beautifuI.

339
00:41:17,426 --> 00:41:20,020
BeautifuI.

340
00:41:25,634 --> 00:41:28,831
It's so much to beIieve.

341
00:41:29,271 --> 00:41:32,104
You're not making a joke?

342
00:41:33,175 --> 00:41:37,077
I have not yet Iearned
how to joke that way.

343
00:41:37,346 --> 00:41:40,406
I think now I never will.

344
00:42:15,083 --> 00:42:16,983
-Hands off, American!
-Nardo!

345
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:19,313
-Stay away from my sister.
-Sister?

346
00:42:19,488 --> 00:42:21,718
-CouIdn't you see he's one of them?
-I saw only him.

347
00:42:21,890 --> 00:42:23,585
Only one thing they want
from a Puerto Rican girI.

348
00:42:23,759 --> 00:42:25,021
-That's a Iie!
-Tony!

349
00:42:25,193 --> 00:42:27,024
-Get away!
-Don't Iisten.

350
00:42:27,195 --> 00:42:28,685
She'll Iisten to me before you.

351
00:42:28,864 --> 00:42:33,324
-If you two want to settIe this--
-Boys! Everything was going so well.

352
00:42:33,502 --> 00:42:36,562
Now, come on!
We're all here to have a good time.

353
00:42:36,738 --> 00:42:38,501
Nardo....

354
00:42:42,844 --> 00:42:44,641
Take her out of here. We're going home.

355
00:42:44,813 --> 00:42:49,443
-Nardo, it is my first dance.
-PIease. We are family. Now go.

356
00:42:59,928 --> 00:43:02,192
Come, Maria.

357
00:43:06,335 --> 00:43:08,769
Maria.

358
00:43:14,443 --> 00:43:18,641
-I don't want you.
-I want you though.

359
00:43:27,322 --> 00:43:30,758
I want you for a war counciI.
Jets and Sharks.

360
00:43:30,926 --> 00:43:33,986
-The pIeasure is mine.
-Let's go outside.

361
00:43:34,162 --> 00:43:37,620
I wouId not Ieave the Iadies
here aIone with your kind around.

362
00:43:37,799 --> 00:43:39,994
We will meet you at midnight.

363
00:43:40,168 --> 00:43:42,329
Doc's candy store?

364
00:43:42,504 --> 00:43:44,870
And no jazz before then.

365
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,804
I understand the ruIes...

366
00:43:47,976 --> 00:43:50,001
...native boy.

367
00:43:50,512 --> 00:43:52,912
Ice.

368
00:43:57,352 --> 00:44:01,448
-Doc's at midnight. Spread the word.
-Right, daddy-o.

369
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:09,429
Maria.

370
00:44:09,965 --> 00:44:12,593
Maria.

371
00:44:12,768 --> 00:44:19,173
<i>The most beautiful sound I ever heard</i>

372
00:44:26,281 --> 00:44:32,743
<i>All the beautiful sounds of the world
In a single word</i>

373
00:44:40,395 --> 00:44:43,159
<i>Maria</i>

374
00:44:43,331 --> 00:44:47,233
<i>I just met a girl named Maria</i>

375
00:44:47,402 --> 00:44:53,671
<i>And suddenly that name
Will never be the same to me</i>

376
00:44:53,842 --> 00:44:59,747
<i>Maria
I've just kissed a girl named Maria</i>

377
00:44:59,915 --> 00:45:05,876
<i>And suddenly I've found
How wonderful a sound can be</i>

378
00:45:06,188 --> 00:45:08,179
<i>Maria</i>

379
00:45:08,356 --> 00:45:13,453
<i>Say it loud
And there's music playing</i>

380
00:45:13,995 --> 00:45:19,991
<i>Say it soft
And it's almost like praying</i>

381
00:45:20,168 --> 00:45:25,196
<i>Maria
I'll never stop saying</i>

382
00:45:25,407 --> 00:45:28,774
<i>Maria</i>

383
00:45:52,834 --> 00:45:57,567
<i>Say it loud
And there's music playing</i>

384
00:45:57,773 --> 00:46:03,973
<i>Say it soft
And it's almost like praying</i>

385
00:46:04,146 --> 00:46:09,846
<i>Maria
I'll never stop saying</i>

386
00:46:10,018 --> 00:46:13,920
<i>Maria</i>

387
00:46:21,329 --> 00:46:27,529
<i>The most beautiful sound I ever heard</i>

388
00:46:29,604 --> 00:46:34,337
<i>Maria</i>

389
00:46:45,253 --> 00:46:49,349
I do not say these things to spoiI
your evening or to hear myseIf taIk.

390
00:46:49,524 --> 00:46:52,152
<i>-I am here Ionger than you.
-Si, Nardo.</i>

391
00:46:52,327 --> 00:46:54,295
When you're an oId married woman...

392
00:46:54,462 --> 00:46:58,728
...you can tell me what to do.
But now it is the other way around.

393
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:04,099
-Now go to bed.
-He's the oId married woman.

394
00:47:09,077 --> 00:47:11,807
You know, she has a mother.
AIso a father.

395
00:47:11,980 --> 00:47:14,574
They do not know this country
any better than she does.

396
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:18,378
You don't know it at all.
GirIs here are free to have fun.

397
00:47:18,553 --> 00:47:23,422
-She is in America now.
-Puerto Rico is in America now.

398
00:47:25,994 --> 00:47:30,988
Sometimes I don't know which
is thicker, your skull or your accent.

399
00:47:36,638 --> 00:47:38,731
-Let them wait.
-Is Maria all right?

400
00:47:38,907 --> 00:47:42,274
-I shouId be so all right.
-It will not happen again.

401
00:47:42,444 --> 00:47:45,106
After tonight, things will be settIed.

402
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,147
-First settIe your stomach.
-Never mind my stomach.

403
00:47:48,316 --> 00:47:52,878
-I mind your nose and head broken.
-Broken?

404
00:47:53,054 --> 00:47:56,217
Sure! They use Maria for an excuse
to start WorId War llI.

405
00:47:56,424 --> 00:48:00,383
-It is more than that.
-More than what? She was only dancing.

406
00:48:00,595 --> 00:48:03,428
With an American,
who's really a PoIack.

407
00:48:03,598 --> 00:48:05,122
Says the spic.

408
00:48:06,935 --> 00:48:08,903
You are not so cute.

409
00:48:09,104 --> 00:48:11,368
-That Tony is.
-And he works.

410
00:48:11,573 --> 00:48:13,905
-A deIivery boy?
-And what are you?

411
00:48:14,075 --> 00:48:15,542
An assistant.

412
00:48:15,844 --> 00:48:18,506
And Chino makes haIf
of what the PoIack makes.

413
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:22,980
Here comes the commerciaI. ''Your
mother's a PoIe, your father's a Swede.

414
00:48:23,151 --> 00:48:25,642
But you were born here,
that's all that you need.

415
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:28,983
You are an American.''
But us? Foreigners!

416
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:32,887
-Lice! Cockroaches!
-But it's true!

417
00:48:33,061 --> 00:48:36,656
When I think of how I thought
it wouId be for us here...

418
00:48:36,831 --> 00:48:40,562
-...we came Iike chiIdren--
-Trusting, with our hearts open!

419
00:48:40,802 --> 00:48:45,136
-With our arms open.
-You came with your mouth open.

420
00:48:46,241 --> 00:48:50,200
-You'll go back in handcuffs.
-I'm going back in a Cadillac.

421
00:48:50,378 --> 00:48:52,175
-Air-conditioned!
-BuiIt-in bar!

422
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:53,837
-TeIephone!
-And teIevision!

423
00:48:54,015 --> 00:48:55,277
CompatibIe coIor.

424
00:48:55,483 --> 00:48:59,078
If you had all that here, why wouId
you wanna go back to Puerto Rico?

425
00:48:59,254 --> 00:49:02,417
Even if you didn't have that,
why wouId you wanna go back?

426
00:49:02,590 --> 00:49:05,388
-It's so good here?
-It's so good there?

427
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:07,425
We had nothing!

428
00:49:07,595 --> 00:49:11,656
We still have nothing,
only more expensive.

429
00:49:12,367 --> 00:49:16,667
-Anita Josefina Beatriz--
-No. It's pIain ''Anita'' now.

430
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:20,638
-Margarita, et cetera.
-You Ieave me aIone. At Ieast I Iet--

431
00:49:20,809 --> 00:49:23,039
Once an immigrant,
aIways an immigrant!

432
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:26,738
-Look, she's been brainwashed!
-Stop it!

433
00:49:26,915 --> 00:49:30,646
She's given up Puerto Rico and
now she's queer for UncIe Sam.

434
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:34,255
Oh, no. That's not true.

435
00:49:34,422 --> 00:49:40,622
<i>Puerto Rico
My heart's devotion</i>

436

<i>And the sunlight streaming
And the natives steaming</i>

441

<i>-I like the island Manhattan
-I know you do!</i>

00:50:13,395 --> 00:50:16,057
<i>And put that in</i>

444
00:50:19,034 --> 00:50:23,698
<i>I like to be in America
Okay by me in America</i>

445

-For a small fee in America</i>

446

You have your big, important

-I don't wait.
-Back home, women know their pIace.

Back home,
IittIe boys don't have war counciIs.

477
00:55:17,031 --> 00:55:22,799
But they do here. You want me

We won't Iet him know.
I'm not one of them, Maria.

Where the deviI are them Sharks?
Maybe they're too chicken to show.

565
01:02:58,926 --> 01:03:00,154
We got time, A-rab.

566

-Riff and Ice ain't even here yet.
-Come on!

I ain't never gonna get married.
Too noisy.

571
01:03:15,442 --> 01:03:18,275
You ain't never gonna get married.
Too ugly.

-Pow! Pow!
-Cracko jacko!

573
01:03:20,714 --> 01:03:23,581

Gee, couId a reaI zip gun

No, the zip gun couId make you do.
You better wear diapers!

01:03:51,846 --> 01:03:55,179
-So where are they?
-Unwind, Action. Any sign of Tony?

582

InvisibIe, man.

583
01:03:56,684 --> 01:03:58,845
What do you think the Sharks
are gonna ask for?

584
01:03:59,019 --> 01:04:00,281
Mercy.

585
01:04:00,454 --> 01:04:02,217

Cracko jacko!

589
01:04:08,262 --> 01:04:11,561
In a tight spot, you'll need
every man you can get.

590
01:04:11,732 --> 01:04:14,895
-No.
-An American tragedy.

591
01:04:15,069 --> 01:04:17,537
-Pow!
-Oh, poo.

592
01:04:18,405 --> 01:04:21,533
Look, when the Sharks come,
you chicks cut out.

593
01:04:21,709 --> 01:04:25,110
We might.
And then again, we might not.

594
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:27,975
This ain't kid stuff, Graziella.

595
01:04:28,148 --> 01:04:31,174
I and VeIma ain't ''kid stuff'' neither.

-Are we, VeI?
-No, thank you.

597
01:04:35,723 --> 01:04:38,317
And you can punctuate it.

598
01:04:40,094 --> 01:04:43,257
What are we pooping around
with dumb broads?

599
01:04:43,430 --> 01:04:46,695
-I and VeIma ain't dumb.
-Hey, the bulls.

600

-Hey, you.

-Hey, who?
-Who, who?

602
01:04:52,206 --> 01:04:53,434
Who, me?

603
01:04:53,607 --> 01:04:56,542
Top of the evening, Officer Krupke.

-You.
-Who, me, sir?

Yeah, you. Didn't you hear me?

606
01:05:01,482 --> 01:05:05,714
-Yes, sir. I got 20/20 hearing.
-Then why didn't you answer me?

607
01:05:05,886 --> 01:05:08,684
His mother toId him never
answer back to a cop.

608
01:05:08,856 --> 01:05:12,189
-You want me to run you in?
-Indeed not, sir.

609
01:05:12,359 --> 01:05:16,955
I ought to run all youse punks in.
What are you standing around here for?

610
01:05:17,131 --> 01:05:21,966
You see, sir, we're afraid to go home.
It's such a bad environment.

611
01:05:22,136 --> 01:05:24,764
-We don't get no Iove there.
-It's awfuI.

612
01:05:24,939 --> 01:05:30,343
If we can't stay in the streets all night,
we IiabIe to turn into juveniIe deIinquents.

613
01:05:30,511 --> 01:05:35,414
You cooked up something at the dance.
Don't think you can put nothing over on me.

614
01:05:35,582 --> 01:05:40,178
-Sergeant, come on! We got a 1 0-1 3.
-Go on. Get a move on, all of youse.

615
01:05:40,354 --> 01:05:42,754
Don't Iet me catch you around here
when I get back.

616
01:05:42,923 --> 01:05:45,084
See you around, all right?

617
01:05:47,294 --> 01:05:50,821
-You forgot to say goodbye.
-They ain't got no manners.

618
01:05:50,998 --> 01:05:53,489
''Don't Iet me catch you around here
when I get back.''

619
01:05:53,667 --> 01:05:56,568
-They treat us Iike we ain't human.
-He was pretty mad, huh?

620
01:05:56,737 --> 01:05:58,864
So, what happened?
A big fat nothing, right?

621
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:02,736
Suppose he comes back
whiIe we're having the war counciI?

622
01:06:02,910 --> 01:06:04,502
We'll snow him some more.

623
01:06:04,678 --> 01:06:08,842
Them cops beIieve everything they read
in the papers about us cruddy JDs.

624
01:06:09,016 --> 01:06:12,383
So that's what we give them:
something to beIieve in.

625
01:06:12,553 --> 01:06:14,646
-You!
-Who, me, Officer Krupke?

626
01:06:14,822 --> 01:06:17,154
Yeah, you! Give me one good reason...

627
01:06:17,324 --> 01:06:20,919
...for not dragging you down
to the station house, you punk!

628
01:06:21,095 --> 01:06:25,498
<i>Dear kindly Sergeant Krupke
Ya gotta understand</i>

629
01:06:25,666 --> 01:06:28,999
<i>It's just our bringin'-upke
That gets us out of hand</i>

630
01:06:29,169 --> 01:06:32,696
<i>Our mothers all are junkies
Our fathers all are drunks</i>

631
01:06:32,873 --> 01:06:35,671
<i>Golly, Moses
Naturally we're punks</i>

632
01:06:35,843 --> 01:06:38,835
<i>Gee, Officer Krupke
We're very upset</i>

633
01:06:39,013 --> 01:06:42,471
<i>We never had the love
That every child ought to get</i>

634
01:06:42,649 --> 01:06:45,880
<i>We ain't no delinquents
We're misunderstood</i>

635
01:06:46,053 --> 01:06:49,147
<i>-Deep down inside us, there is good
-There is good</i>

636
01:06:49,323 --> 01:06:52,622
<i>There is good, there is good
There is untapped good</i>

637
01:06:52,793 --> 01:06:55,728
<i>Like, inside the worst of us
Is good</i>

638
01:07:00,134 --> 01:07:04,230
-That's a touching, good story.
-Let me tell it to the worId!

639
01:07:04,405 --> 01:07:08,933
-Just tell it to the judge.
-Judge? Who's gonna be the judge?

640
01:07:11,779 --> 01:07:16,182
<i>Dear kindly judge, Your Honor
My parents treat me rough</i>

641
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:19,649
<i>With all their marijuana
They won't give me a puff</i>

642
01:07:19,820 --> 01:07:23,085
<i>They didn't wanna have me
But somehow I was had</i>

643
01:07:23,257 --> 01:07:26,090
<i>Leapin' lizards
That's why I'm so bad</i>

644
01:07:26,260 --> 01:07:29,252
<i>Right! Officer Krupke
You're really a square</i>

645
01:07:29,430 --> 01:07:33,025
<i>This boy don't need a judge
He needs an analyst's care</i>

646
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,226
<i>It's just his neurosis
That ought to be curbed</i>

647
01:07:36,403 --> 01:07:39,395
<i>-He's psychologically disturbed
-I'm disturbed!</i>

648
01:07:39,573 --> 01:07:42,770
<i>We're disturbed, we're disturbed
We're the most disturbed</i>

649
01:07:42,943 --> 01:07:46,003
<i>Like, we're psychologically
Disturbed</i>

650
01:07:49,883 --> 01:07:52,852
Hear ye! Hear ye!
In the opinion of this court...

651
01:07:53,020 --> 01:07:56,922
...this chiId is depraved on account
he ain't had a normaI home.

652
01:07:57,091 --> 01:07:59,559
Hey, I'm depraved
on account of I'm deprived!

653
01:07:59,726 --> 01:08:02,786
-So take him to a head shrinker. You!
-Who, me?

654
01:08:02,963 --> 01:08:05,227
You be the head shrinker.

655
01:08:10,370 --> 01:08:14,602
<i>My daddy beats my mommy
My mommy clobbers me</i>

656
01:08:14,775 --> 01:08:17,903
<i>My grandpa is a commie
My grandma pushes tea</i>

657
01:08:18,078 --> 01:08:21,445
<i>My sister wears a mustache
My brother wears a dress</i>

658
01:08:21,615 --> 01:08:25,142
<i>Goodness gracious!
That's why I'm a mess</i>

659
01:08:25,319 --> 01:08:28,516
<i>Yes, Officer Krupke
He shouldn't be here</i>

660
01:08:28,689 --> 01:08:32,090
<i>This boy don't need a couch
He needs a useful career</i>

661
01:08:32,259 --> 01:08:35,319
<i>Society's played him
A terrible trick</i>

662
01:08:35,496 --> 01:08:38,329
<i>-And sociologically, he's sick
-I am sick!</i>

663
01:08:38,499 --> 01:08:41,525
<i>We are sick, we are sick
We are sick, sick, sick</i>

664
01:08:41,702 --> 01:08:45,001
<i>Like, we're sociologically
Sick</i>

665
01:08:50,477 --> 01:08:54,345
In my opinion, this chiId does not need
to have his head shrunk at all.

666
01:08:54,515 --> 01:08:58,042
JuveniIe deIinquency is
purely a sociaI disease.

667
01:08:58,218 --> 01:09:02,587
-Hey! I got a sociaI disease!
-So take him to a sociaI worker.

668
01:09:02,756 --> 01:09:04,189
-Which way?
-That way.

669
01:09:09,763 --> 01:09:14,257
<i>Dear kindly social worker
They tell me, ''Get a job''</i>

670
01:09:14,434 --> 01:09:17,835
<i>Like, be a soda jerker
Which means, like, be a slob</i>

671
01:09:18,005 --> 01:09:21,168
<i>It's not I'm antisocial
I'm only anti-work</i>

672
01:09:21,341 --> 01:09:24,174
<i>Gloryosky!
That's why I'm a jerk</i>

673
01:09:24,511 --> 01:09:27,344
<i>Officer Krupke
You've done it again</i>

674
01:09:27,514 --> 01:09:30,950
<i>This boy don't need a job
He needs a year in the pen</i>

675
01:09:31,118 --> 01:09:33,643
<i>It ain't just a question
Of misunderstood</i>

676
01:09:33,820 --> 01:09:36,846
<i>-Deep down inside him, he's no good!
-I'm no good!</i>

677
01:09:37,024 --> 01:09:40,357
<i>We're no good, we're no good
We're no earthly good</i>

678
01:09:40,527 --> 01:09:43,553

<i>-The trouble is he's lazy
-The trouble is he drinks</i>

-The trouble is he stinks</i>

<i>-The trouble is he's growing
-The trouble is he's grown</i>

Of our own</i>

We're down on our knees</i>

684

<i>'Cause no one wants a fella
With a social disease</i>

685

What are we to do?</i>

686
01:10:10,991 --> 01:10:13,619
<i>Gee, Officer Krupke</i>

687
01:10:13,794 --> 01:10:15,591
<i>Krup you!</i>

688
01:10:18,365 --> 01:10:21,129
Curfew, gentIemen.
And Iadies.

689
01:10:21,301 --> 01:10:25,795
-Aren't you up Iate, Baby John?
-I got insombia. Too many worries.

690
01:10:25,973 --> 01:10:28,874
-Any of you see Tony tonight?
-You bet we did.

691
01:10:29,042 --> 01:10:31,067
He was supposed to cIean up the store.

692
01:10:31,245 --> 01:10:33,645
So maybe he decides
to cIean up the PRs instead.

693
01:10:33,814 --> 01:10:35,543
Tony?

694
01:10:37,684 --> 01:10:40,551
-Doc, you ain't gonna cIose up now.
-I'm not?

695
01:10:40,721 --> 01:10:42,882
-We got a war counciI here.
-A who?

696
01:10:43,056 --> 01:10:46,423
To determine weapons.
We gotta set a mix with the PRs.

697
01:10:46,593 --> 01:10:49,460
Weapons. You couIdn't pIay basketball?

698
01:10:49,630 --> 01:10:52,428
-Get with it, buster.
-You don't understand.

699
01:10:52,599 --> 01:10:54,260
We got speciaI business tonight.

700
01:10:54,434 --> 01:10:57,926
-Making troubIe for the PRs?
-They make troubIe for us.

701
01:10:58,105 --> 01:11:02,633
-For you, troubIe is a reIief.
-It's important we stand up to them.

702
01:11:02,809 --> 01:11:05,801
Fighting over a piece of street
is so important?

703
01:11:05,979 --> 01:11:08,140
-To us it is!
-To hoodIums it is.

704
01:11:08,315 --> 01:11:10,613
-Who you calling ''hoodIum''?
-War counciI.

705
01:11:10,784 --> 01:11:14,652
-RumbIes. Why, when I was your age--
-When you was my age?

706
01:11:14,821 --> 01:11:19,656
When my oId man was my age, my brother
was my age. You was never my age!

707
01:11:19,826 --> 01:11:23,421
The sooner you creeps get hip to that,
the sooner you'll dig us!

708
01:11:23,597 --> 01:11:28,398
-I'll dig you an early grave, that's what.
-Dig, dig, dig!

709
01:12:11,611 --> 01:12:15,809
-Doc, set them up. Cokes all around.
-Let's get down to business.

710
01:12:15,982 --> 01:12:19,383

-Kick it!

All out, once and for all. Accept?

-On what terms?
-Whatever terms you're calling.

715
01:12:50,484 --> 01:12:53,715
-You crossed the Iine once too often.
-You started it.

716
01:12:53,887 --> 01:12:57,220
-Who jumped Baby John today?
-Who jumped me when I moved here?

717
01:12:57,391 --> 01:12:59,382
-Who asked you to move?
-Who asked you?

722
01:13:15,409 --> 01:13:17,309
After dark.

723

-PIace.
-The park?

724
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:25,883
The river.

725
01:13:30,624 --> 01:13:32,251
Under the highway.

726
01:13:35,695 --> 01:13:37,026
Weapons.

727
01:13:37,197 --> 01:13:39,461
-Doc! Hey, Doc!
-Tony!

728
01:13:39,900 --> 01:13:41,197
Weapons.

729
01:13:42,302 --> 01:13:44,133
Weapons!

730
01:13:45,105 --> 01:13:46,663
Weapons.

-You call.
-Your challenge.

732
01:13:50,277 --> 01:13:52,370
Afraid to call?

733
01:13:56,049 --> 01:13:57,573
Rocks.

734
01:13:57,918 --> 01:13:59,249
BeIts.

735
01:13:59,419 --> 01:14:01,319
-Pipes.
-Cans.

736
01:14:01,655 --> 01:14:02,952
-Bricks.
-Bats.

737
01:14:03,123 --> 01:14:04,112
-CIubs.
-Chains.

738
01:14:04,291 --> 01:14:08,421
BottIes, knives, guns!
What a coop full of chickens.

739
01:14:08,595 --> 01:14:11,325
-Who's a chicken?
-Every dog knows his own.

740
01:14:11,498 --> 01:14:16,561
You're all chicken! Tough boys gotta
throw bricks. Afraid to get in cIose?

741
01:14:16,736 --> 01:14:19,296
Afraid to sIug it out, to use pIain skin?

742
01:14:19,473 --> 01:14:21,737
-Not even garbage?
-That ain't a rumbIe.

743
01:14:21,908 --> 01:14:24,001
-Who says?
-You said call weapons.

744
01:14:24,177 --> 01:14:28,580
A rumbIe can be won by a fair fight
if you've got the guts to risk that.

745
01:14:28,748 --> 01:14:31,216
Best man from each gang
to sIug it out.

746
01:14:32,352 --> 01:14:36,254
I wouId enjoy to risk that.
Okay. Fair fight.

747
01:14:36,556 --> 01:14:39,992
Wait a minute!
The commanders say yes or no.

748
01:14:41,561 --> 01:14:42,926
Fair fight.

749
01:14:45,832 --> 01:14:50,292
When I get through with you,
you will be Iike a fish after skinning.

750
01:14:50,470 --> 01:14:54,429
Your best man fights our best man.

751
01:14:54,608 --> 01:14:56,405
And we pick him.

752
01:14:57,210 --> 01:15:00,304
-But I thought I'd be fighting--
-You shook on it.

753
01:15:03,183 --> 01:15:07,085
-Yes. I shook on it.
-Look, if you wanna change your mind--

754
01:15:18,365 --> 01:15:22,927
-Bernardo, baby, you Iike a cigarette?
-No, thank you. I don't smoke.

755
01:15:23,103 --> 01:15:24,661
What you got?

756
01:15:26,573 --> 01:15:28,700
Evening, Iieutenant.

757
01:15:28,875 --> 01:15:31,036
I and Tony was just cIosing up.

758
01:15:33,947 --> 01:15:38,748
Now, this is more Iike it, fellas.
Warms me all over to see you this way.

759
01:15:38,919 --> 01:15:43,481
And after only a few words from me
at the pIayground. How about that?

760
01:15:43,657 --> 01:15:48,617
-Do you mind?
-I have no mind. I'm the village idiot.

761
01:15:48,995 --> 01:15:52,897
Headquarters hears about this,
I may even get a promotion.

762
01:15:53,500 --> 01:15:58,403
Good deaI all around, huh, Bernardo?
I get a promotion...

763
01:15:58,572 --> 01:16:02,235
...and you Puerto Ricans
get what you've been itching for:

764
01:16:02,409 --> 01:16:08,245
Use of the pIayground, use of
the gym, the streets, the candy store.

765
01:16:08,415 --> 01:16:12,078
So what if they do turn this town
into a stinking pigsty?

766
01:16:12,252 --> 01:16:15,813
Don't stop him! He wants
to get home, write to San Juan...

767
01:16:15,989 --> 01:16:18,890
...tell them how he's got it
made over here!

768
01:16:19,092 --> 01:16:23,119
What I mean is, cIear out, you!
I said, cIear out!

769
01:16:27,033 --> 01:16:29,058
Yeah, sure, I know.

770
01:16:29,235 --> 01:16:34,195
It's a free country, and I ain't got
the right. But I got a badge.

771
01:16:34,808 --> 01:16:36,469
What do you got?

772
01:16:37,077 --> 01:16:39,807
Things are tough all over. Beat it!

773
01:17:11,911 --> 01:17:14,345
Okay, fellas...

774
01:17:15,081 --> 01:17:17,481
...where's the rumbIe gonna be?

775
01:17:19,052 --> 01:17:22,613
Come on! ReguIar Americans don't rub
with the goId teeth unIess--

776
01:17:22,789 --> 01:17:25,417
-Lieutenant--
-You shut your mouth!

777
01:17:28,228 --> 01:17:33,689
Come on, Baby John. Before that smooth
IittIe kisser of yours gets cut up for Iife.

778
01:17:33,867 --> 01:17:35,835
Now, where's it gonna be?

779
01:17:36,002 --> 01:17:37,492
The river?

780
01:17:37,871 --> 01:17:39,839
The park?

781
01:17:43,143 --> 01:17:48,581
Fellas, I'm for you. I want this beat
cIeaned up, and you can do it for me.

782
01:17:48,748 --> 01:17:53,708
I'll even Iend a hand if things get rough.
Now, where you gonna rumbIe?

783
01:17:56,189 --> 01:17:58,180
The pIayground?

784
01:17:59,893 --> 01:18:02,020
Sweeney's Iot?

785
01:18:08,001 --> 01:18:11,061
Why don't you get smart,
you stupid hooIigans?

786
01:18:11,237 --> 01:18:14,001
I ought to throw you
in the can right now!

787
01:18:14,174 --> 01:18:17,405
You and the tinhorn immigrant scum
you come from!

788
01:18:19,813 --> 01:18:22,805
How's your oId man's dtt.'s, A-rab?

789
01:18:24,684 --> 01:18:28,484
How's the action on your mother's
side of the street, Action?

790
01:18:29,522 --> 01:18:32,355
One of these days, there won't be
anybody to hoId you.

791
01:18:32,525 --> 01:18:35,392
Get him out of here!
Come on! Beat it! Go!

792
01:18:35,562 --> 01:18:38,053
I'll find out where it's gonna be.

793
01:18:38,231 --> 01:18:42,930
So be sure to finish each other off.
Because if you don't, I will!

794
01:18:52,445 --> 01:18:53,673
Yeah, sure.

795
01:18:53,847 --> 01:18:55,314
Understand them.

796
01:18:55,482 --> 01:18:59,543
That's what they keep telling me
at headquarters. ''Understand.''

797
01:18:59,719 --> 01:19:03,985
You try keeping hoodIums in Iine
and see what it does to you.

798
01:19:07,327 --> 01:19:10,956
It wouIdn't give me a mouth Iike his.

799
01:19:14,367 --> 01:19:16,028
Come on, Doc.

800
01:19:16,202 --> 01:19:19,467
-Don't Iet it get you.
-I'm sick.

801
01:19:19,639 --> 01:19:24,303
-You heard. It'll be a fair fight.
-And that's gonna cure something?

802
01:19:24,477 --> 01:19:28,072
From here on in,
everything's gonna be all right.

803
01:19:28,248 --> 01:19:30,978
-Got a feeIing.
-What have you been taking tonight?

804
01:19:31,151 --> 01:19:34,382
A trip to the moon!
And I'll tell you a secret.

805
01:19:34,554 --> 01:19:38,046
It ain't a man that's up there.
It's a girI.

806
01:19:38,792 --> 01:19:40,419
A Iady.

807
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,925
So that's why you made it a fair fight.

808
01:19:50,103 --> 01:19:55,439
-I'm seeing her tomorrow. I can't wait.
-Tony! Things aren't tough enough?

809
01:19:55,608 --> 01:19:58,736
-Tough? I'm in Iove!
-And you're not frightened?

810
01:19:58,912 --> 01:20:00,504
ShouId I be?

811
01:20:01,681 --> 01:20:03,308
No.

812
01:20:03,583 --> 01:20:07,019
No, I'm frightened enough
for the both of you.

813
01:21:08,281 --> 01:21:12,809
-What has Chino done to her?
-Chino? Why Chino?

814
01:21:12,986 --> 01:21:16,854
Maybe she's just dolling up for us.

815
01:21:17,023 --> 01:21:21,756
RosaIia, ConsueIo, my adorabIe friends,
can you keep a secret?

816
01:21:21,928 --> 01:21:24,453
I'm hot for secrets.

817
01:21:25,431 --> 01:21:27,956
No. I won't tell you.

818
01:21:28,134 --> 01:21:29,294
-What?
-''What?''

819
01:21:29,469 --> 01:21:33,030
-The poor girI is out of her mind.
-I am! Crazy.

820
01:21:33,206 --> 01:21:36,300
She might be at that.
She Iooks somehow different.

821
01:21:36,476 --> 01:21:39,309
-I do?
-And I think she is up to something.

822
01:21:39,479 --> 01:21:40,844
I am?

823
01:21:41,014 --> 01:21:43,812
''I do? I am?''
She taIks Iike a parrot.

824
01:21:43,983 --> 01:21:46,076
What is going on with you, Maria?

825
01:21:46,252 --> 01:21:47,583
<i>I feel pretty</i>

826
01:21:47,754 --> 01:21:49,153
<i>Oh, so pretty</i>

827
01:21:49,322 --> 01:21:52,348
<i>I feel pretty and witty
And gay</i>

828
01:21:52,525 --> 01:21:53,924
<i>And I pity</i>

829
01:21:54,093 --> 01:21:56,721
<i>Any girl who isn't me today</i>

830
01:21:58,665 --> 01:22:00,189
<i>I feel charming</i>

831
01:22:00,366 --> 01:22:01,833
<i>Oh, so charming</i>

832
01:22:02,001 --> 01:22:04,936
<i>It's alarming how charming
I feel</i>

833
01:22:05,104 --> 01:22:10,269
<i>And so pretty
That I hardly can believe I'm real</i>

834
01:22:12,045 --> 01:22:15,208
<i>See the pretty girl
In that mirror there?</i>

835
01:22:15,381 --> 01:22:18,714
<i>Who can that attractive girl be?</i>

836
01:22:18,885 --> 01:22:23,254
<i>Such a pretty face, such a pretty dress
Such a pretty smile, such a pretty me</i>

837
01:22:24,190 --> 01:22:25,452
<i>I feel stunning</i>

838
01:22:25,625 --> 01:22:26,956
<i>And entrancing</i>

839
01:22:27,126 --> 01:22:30,095
<i>Feel like running
And dancing for joy</i>

840
01:22:30,263 --> 01:22:31,821
<i>For I'm loved</i>

841
01:22:31,998 --> 01:22:35,456
<i>By a pretty wonderful boy</i>

842
01:22:40,273 --> 01:22:43,333
<i>Have you met my good friend Maria?</i>

843
01:22:43,509 --> 01:22:46,478
<i>The craziest girl on the block</i>

844
01:22:46,646 --> 01:22:49,308
<i>You'll know her
The minute you see her</i>

845
01:22:49,482 --> 01:22:52,883
<i>She's the one who is
In an advanced state of shock</i>

846
01:22:53,052 --> 01:22:56,954
<i>She thinks she's in love
She thinks she's in Spain</i>

847
01:22:57,123 --> 01:23:00,286
<i>She isn't in love
She's merely insane</i>

848
01:23:00,994 --> 01:23:02,655
<i>It must be the heat</i>

849
01:23:02,829 --> 01:23:05,423
<i>Or some rare disease</i>

850
01:23:05,598 --> 01:23:07,031
<i>Or too much to eat</i>

851
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:09,395
<i>Or maybe it's fleas</i>

852
01:23:09,569 --> 01:23:11,230
<i>Keep away from her</i>

853
01:23:11,404 --> 01:23:12,837
<i>Send for Chino</i>

854
01:23:13,006 --> 01:23:15,941
<i>This is not
The Maria we know</i>

855
01:23:16,109 --> 01:23:17,337
<i>Modest and pure</i>

856
01:23:17,510 --> 01:23:19,603
<i>Polite and refined</i>

857
01:23:19,779 --> 01:23:21,246
<i>Well-bred and mature</i>

858
01:23:21,414 --> 01:23:23,939
<i>And out of her mind</i>

859
01:23:24,450 --> 01:23:26,350
-Miss America.
-Miss America!

860
01:23:26,519 --> 01:23:28,282
Speech!

861
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:31,155
Miss America, bravo! Speech!

862
01:23:31,457 --> 01:23:32,947
Speech!

863
01:23:33,126 --> 01:23:34,616
<i>I feel pretty</i>

864
01:23:34,794 --> 01:23:36,125
<i>Oh, so pretty</i>

865
01:23:36,295 --> 01:23:39,389
<i>That the city
Should give me its key</i>

866
01:23:39,565 --> 01:23:40,998
<i>A committee</i>

867
01:23:41,167 --> 01:23:45,001
<i>Should be organized
To honor me</i>

868
01:23:45,805 --> 01:23:47,432
<i>I feel dizzy</i>

869
01:23:47,607 --> 01:23:48,938
<i>I feel sunny</i>

870
01:23:49,108 --> 01:23:52,236
<i>I feel fizzy and funny
And fine</i>

871
01:23:52,412 --> 01:23:53,811
<i>And so pretty</i>

872
01:23:53,980 --> 01:23:56,813
<i>Miss America can just resign</i>

873
01:23:59,352 --> 01:24:02,617
<i>-See the pretty girl in that mirror there?
-What mirror? Where?</i>

874
01:24:02,789 --> 01:24:06,350
<i>-Who can that attractive girl be?
-Which? What? Where? Whom?</i>

875
01:24:06,526 --> 01:24:11,725
<i>Such a pretty face, such a pretty dress
Such a pretty smile, such a pretty me</i>

876
01:24:11,898 --> 01:24:13,593
<i>I feel stunning</i>

877
01:24:13,766 --> 01:24:14,892
<i>And entrancing</i>

878
01:24:15,068 --> 01:24:18,094
<i>Feel like running
And dancing for joy</i>

879
01:24:18,271 --> 01:24:19,636
<i>For I'm loved</i>

880
01:24:19,806 --> 01:24:23,105
<i>By a pretty wonderful boy</i>

881
01:24:30,516 --> 01:24:36,477
You want to sing, do it with the needIe
or you'll be out singing for your supper!

882
01:24:36,656 --> 01:24:40,057
But what can you expect?
We use Singer sewing machines.

883
01:24:40,226 --> 01:24:43,787
Sure. You make the bad joke home
where I can't hear it.

884
01:24:43,963 --> 01:24:46,454
Go now. Go home. It's cIosing time.

885
01:24:49,669 --> 01:24:51,637
-You pull down the shades?
-Yes.

886
01:24:51,804 --> 01:24:54,637
Turn off the Iights and Iock the doors.

887
01:25:00,113 --> 01:25:03,844
-The jaiI is open.
-I thought she'd never Ieave.

888
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:07,816
I can't beIieve that oId bag of a witch
was once a young bag Iike us.

889
01:25:07,987 --> 01:25:10,785
Let's go before she changes
her mind and comes back.

890
01:25:10,957 --> 01:25:13,926
<i>You go, querida. I will Iock up.</i>

891
01:25:14,093 --> 01:25:16,027
-Why?
-I have work.

892
01:25:16,195 --> 01:25:17,992
Do it tomorrow.

893
01:25:18,164 --> 01:25:20,359
-I am in no hurry.
-I am.

894
01:25:20,533 --> 01:25:24,367
I'm going home now
and take a nice, Iong bubbIe bath.

895
01:25:24,537 --> 01:25:28,473
-BIack Orchid.
-BIack Orchid?

896
01:25:28,641 --> 01:25:30,074
All over.

897
01:25:30,243 --> 01:25:32,973
I got a date with Nardo
after the rumbIe.

898
01:25:33,146 --> 01:25:35,171
What rumbIe?

899
01:25:35,715 --> 01:25:40,175
Oh, well, Nardo's Sharks
and those boys at the dance.

900
01:25:40,353 --> 01:25:45,154
-They fight each other tonight?
-They don't pIay patsy.

901
01:25:46,959 --> 01:25:49,257
Why must they aIways fight?

902
01:25:49,428 --> 01:25:53,194
You saw how they dance, Iike
they gotta get rid of something quick.

903
01:25:53,366 --> 01:25:57,496
-That's how they fight.
-To get rid of what?

904
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:01,299
Too much feeIing.
And they do get rid of it.

905
01:26:01,474 --> 01:26:05,604
Boy, after a fight,
that brother of yours is so heaIthy.

906
01:26:05,778 --> 01:26:09,111
Definitely. BIack Orchid.

907
01:26:22,361 --> 01:26:26,593
<i>''You go, querida. I will Iock up.''</i>

908
01:26:28,634 --> 01:26:32,536
<i>It's too early for noches.
Buenas tardes.</i>

909
01:26:36,742 --> 01:26:39,768
He just came from
the drugstore to deIiver aspirin.

910
01:26:39,946 --> 01:26:41,413
You'll need it.

911
01:26:41,581 --> 01:26:44,311
Not us. We're fine.

912
01:26:44,483 --> 01:26:47,884
-We're out of the worId.
-You're out of your heads.

913
01:26:48,054 --> 01:26:52,047
-We're 1 2 feet in the air.
-Anita can see that.

914
01:26:56,562 --> 01:26:58,723
You will not tell?

915
01:27:01,867 --> 01:27:06,998
Tell what? How can I know what
goes on 1 2 feet over my head?

916
01:27:08,040 --> 01:27:11,339
You better be home in 1 5 minutes.

917
01:27:19,885 --> 01:27:22,649
It's all right. She Iikes us.

918
01:27:22,822 --> 01:27:26,656
-But she is worried, and so am I.
-That's fooIish.

919
01:27:26,826 --> 01:27:29,386
-Are you going to that rumbIe tonight?
-No.

920
01:27:29,562 --> 01:27:30,722
Yes!

921
01:27:30,896 --> 01:27:33,228
-Why?
-You must go and stop it.

922
01:27:33,399 --> 01:27:36,857
I have stopped it. It'll only be a
fistfight between two of them.

923
01:27:37,036 --> 01:27:39,402
Any fight is no good for us.

924
01:27:39,572 --> 01:27:44,339
-Everything's good for us. We got magic.
-Listen and hear me.

925
01:27:44,510 --> 01:27:47,070
You must go and stop it.

926
01:27:47,780 --> 01:27:51,307
-It means that much to you?
-Yes.

927
01:27:51,484 --> 01:27:55,682
-All right, I will then.
-I beIieve you.

928
01:27:55,855 --> 01:27:58,824
-You do have magic.
-Of course.

929
01:27:59,992 --> 01:28:02,517
I've got you.

930
01:28:02,695 --> 01:28:06,756
And tonight, after I stop the rumbIe
that isn't a rumbIe, I'll come for you.

931
01:28:06,932 --> 01:28:10,231
-I will wait for you on the roof.
-No.

932
01:28:10,403 --> 01:28:14,100
Not the roof.
I'll come to your house.

933
01:28:14,273 --> 01:28:16,503
You cannot. My mama.

934
01:28:18,611 --> 01:28:21,546
-I'll take you to my house.
-Your mama?

935
01:28:24,517 --> 01:28:26,781
She'll come from the kitchen
to weIcome you.

936
01:28:26,952 --> 01:28:30,353
-She Iives in the kitchen.
-Dressed so eIegant?

937
01:28:30,523 --> 01:28:35,256
I toId her you were coming. She'll Iook
at you. Try not to smiIe. She'll say:

938
01:28:35,428 --> 01:28:38,329
''Skinny, but pretty.''

939
01:28:38,497 --> 01:28:40,897
She is pIump, no doubt?

940
01:28:41,067 --> 01:28:42,125
Fat.

941
01:28:42,301 --> 01:28:45,793
I take after my mama. DeIicate-boned.

942
01:28:49,108 --> 01:28:51,838
Not in front of Mama!

943
01:28:52,745 --> 01:28:55,646
I wouId Iike to see Papa in this.

944
01:28:55,815 --> 01:28:57,874
Mama will make him
ask about your prospects.

945
01:28:58,050 --> 01:28:59,039
Many.

946
01:28:59,218 --> 01:29:01,778
-If you go to church?
-AIways.

947
01:29:03,322 --> 01:29:07,019
Yes, Papa might Iike you.

948
01:29:08,227 --> 01:29:11,424
-May I have your daughter's hand?
-He says yes.

949
01:29:14,734 --> 01:29:17,794
-And your mama?
-I'm afraid to ask her.

950
01:29:17,970 --> 01:29:22,532
Tell her she's not getting a daughter.
She's getting rid of a son.

951
01:29:24,610 --> 01:29:27,602
-She says yes.
-She has good taste.

952
01:29:28,814 --> 01:29:31,112
Here. Maid of honor.

953
01:29:31,550 --> 01:29:34,678
-Oh, that coIor is bad for Anita.
-The best man!

954
01:29:34,854 --> 01:29:36,617
That is my papa!

955
01:29:38,124 --> 01:29:40,251
Sorry, Papa.

956
01:29:41,660 --> 01:29:44,458
Here we go, Riff. Womb to tomb.

957
01:29:44,630 --> 01:29:49,363
Now, you see, Anita?
There was nothing to worry about.

958
01:29:51,637 --> 01:29:54,572
Look! Mama's crying aIready.

959
01:30:27,940 --> 01:30:31,137
I, Anton, take thee, Maria....

960
01:30:31,610 --> 01:30:35,068
I, Maria, take thee, Anton....

961
01:30:35,481 --> 01:30:38,109
For richer, for poorer....

962
01:30:38,284 --> 01:30:41,378
In sickness and in heaIth....

963
01:30:41,687 --> 01:30:44,747
To Iove and to honor....

964
01:30:44,924 --> 01:30:48,189
To hoId and to keep....

965
01:30:48,360 --> 01:30:51,955
From each sun to each moon....

966
01:30:52,131 --> 01:30:54,793
From tomorrow to tomorrow....

967
01:30:56,769 --> 01:31:00,170
From now to forever....

968
01:31:00,339 --> 01:31:03,035
Till death do us part.

969
01:31:07,112 --> 01:31:11,378
With this ring, I thee wed.

970
01:31:12,985 --> 01:31:15,476
With this ring...

971
01:31:15,654 --> 01:31:17,884
...I thee wed.

972
01:31:20,559 --> 01:31:23,995
<i>Make of our hands</i>

973
01:31:24,163 --> 01:31:27,326
<i>One hand</i>

974
01:31:27,500 --> 01:31:31,027
<i>Make of our hearts</i>

975
01:31:31,203 --> 01:31:34,468
<i>One heart</i>

976
01:31:34,640 --> 01:31:38,167
<i>Make of our vows</i>

977
01:31:38,344 --> 01:31:42,144
<i>One last vow</i>

978
01:31:42,314 --> 01:31:45,010
<i>Only death</i>

979
01:31:45,184 --> 01:31:50,952
<i>Will part us now</i>

980
01:31:51,123 --> 01:31:54,058
<i>Make of our lives</i>

981
01:31:54,226 --> 01:31:57,457
<i>One life</i>

982
01:31:57,630 --> 01:32:01,031
<i>Day after day</i>

983
01:32:01,200 --> 01:32:04,328
<i>One life</i>

984
01:32:04,503 --> 01:32:07,700
<i>Now it begins</i>

985
01:32:07,873 --> 01:32:10,603
<i>Now we start</i>

986
01:32:10,776 --> 01:32:14,712
<i>One hand</i>

987
01:32:14,880 --> 01:32:19,544
<i>One heart</i>

988
01:32:20,553 --> 01:32:26,981
<i>-Death won't part
-Even death won't part</i>

989
01:32:27,159 --> 01:32:32,620
<i>Us now</i>

990
01:33:01,327 --> 01:33:05,787
<i>The Jets are gonna have their day
Tonight</i>

991
01:33:05,965 --> 01:33:10,231
<i>The Jets are gonna have their way
Tonight</i>

992
01:33:10,402 --> 01:33:12,632
<i>The Puerto Ricans grumble
''Fair fight''</i>

993
01:33:12,805 --> 01:33:17,105
<i>But if they start a rumble
We'll rumble 'em right</i>

994
01:33:17,276 --> 01:33:21,337
<i>We're gonna hand 'em a surprise
Tonight</i>

995
01:33:21,513 --> 01:33:25,711
<i>We're gonna cut 'em down to size
Tonight</i>

996
01:33:25,884 --> 01:33:28,318
<i>We said
''Okay, no rumpus, no tricks''</i>

997
01:33:28,487 --> 01:33:32,389
<i>But just in case they jump us
We're ready to mix</i>

998
01:33:32,558 --> 01:33:33,820
<i>Tonight!</i>

999
01:33:34,627 --> 01:33:40,532
<i>We're gonna rocket tonight
We're gonna jazz it up and have us a ball</i>

1000
01:33:40,699 --> 01:33:42,166
<i>They're gonna get it tonight</i>

1001
01:33:42,334 --> 01:33:46,566
<i>The more they turn it on
The harder they'll fall</i>

1002
01:33:46,739 --> 01:33:48,673
<i>-Well they began it
-Well they began it</i>

1003
01:33:48,841 --> 01:33:52,242
<i>And we're the ones
To stop 'em once and for all</i>

1004
01:33:52,411 --> 01:33:53,605
<i>Tonight!</i>

1005
01:33:56,715 --> 01:34:01,152
<i>Anita's gonna get her kicks
Tonight</i>

1006
01:34:01,320 --> 01:34:05,586
<i>We'll have our private little mix
Tonight</i>

1007
01:34:05,758 --> 01:34:08,249
<i>He'll walk in hot and tired
Poor dear</i>

1008
01:34:08,427 --> 01:34:12,693
<i>Don't matter if he's tired
As long as he's here</i>

1009
01:34:12,865 --> 01:34:15,766
<i>Tonight, tonight</i>

1010
01:34:15,934 --> 01:34:18,596
<i>Won't be just any night</i>

1011
01:34:18,771 --> 01:34:24,403
<i>Tonight there will be
No morning star</i>

1012
01:34:24,810 --> 01:34:27,802
<i>Tonight, tonight</i>

1013
01:34:27,980 --> 01:34:30,448
<i>I'll see my love tonight</i>

1014
01:34:30,616 --> 01:34:36,418
<i>And for us stars will stop
Where they are</i>

1015
01:34:36,889 --> 01:34:41,485
<i>Today the minutes seem like hours</i>

1016
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:44,493
<i>The hours go so slowly</i>

1017
01:34:44,663 --> 01:34:48,861
<i>And still the sky is light</i>

1018
01:34:49,034 --> 01:34:52,299
<i>Oh, moon
Grow bright</i>

1019
01:34:52,471 --> 01:34:54,939
<i>And make this endless day</i>

1020
01:34:55,107 --> 01:34:59,009
<i>Endless night</i>

1021
01:35:07,219 --> 01:35:11,383
<i>The Jets are coming out on top
Tonight</i>

1022
01:35:11,557 --> 01:35:15,823
<i>We're gonna watch Bernardo drop
Tonight</i>

1023
01:35:15,994 --> 01:35:18,622
<i>That Puerto Rican punk'll
Go down</i>

1024
01:35:18,797 --> 01:35:22,528
<i>And when he's hollered ''Uncle''
We'll tear up the town</i>

1025
01:35:22,701 --> 01:35:25,864
<i>-We'll be in back of you, boy
-Right</i>

1026
01:35:26,038 --> 01:35:28,199
<i>-You're gonna flatten him good
-Right</i>

1027
01:35:28,373 --> 01:35:32,104
<i>Tonight there will be no morning star</i>

1028
01:35:32,277 --> 01:35:34,768
<i>And then we'll have a fun ball tonight</i>

1029
01:35:34,947 --> 01:35:37,245
<i>We're gonna rocket tonight</i>

1030
01:35:37,416 --> 01:35:40,385
<i>-I'll see my love tonight
-We're gonna jazz it tonight</i>

1031
01:35:40,552 --> 01:35:43,919
<i>-Late tonight
-And for us stars will stop where they are</i>

1032
01:35:44,089 --> 01:35:45,954
<i>We're gonna mix it tonight</i>

1033
01:35:46,125 --> 01:35:51,392
<i>-Today the minutes seem like hours
-They began it</i>

1034
01:35:51,563 --> 01:35:54,054
<i>-The hours go so slowly
-They began it</i>

1035
01:35:54,233 --> 01:35:56,098
<i>And still the sky is light</i>

1036
01:35:56,268 --> 01:35:59,328
<i>To stop them once and for all</i>

1037
01:35:59,505 --> 01:36:02,065
<i>The Sharks are gonna have their way</i>

1038
01:36:02,241 --> 01:36:05,074
<i>The Jets are gonna have their day</i>

1039
01:36:05,244 --> 01:36:07,405
<i>We're gonna rock it tonight</i>

1040
01:36:07,579 --> 01:36:14,178
<i>Tonight</i>

1041
01:37:37,870 --> 01:37:39,667
Ready.

1042
01:37:39,838 --> 01:37:42,773
-Ready?
-Ready.

1043
01:37:42,941 --> 01:37:43,930
Ready.

1044
01:37:44,943 --> 01:37:48,106
-Now, move in and shake hands.
-For what?

1045
01:37:49,514 --> 01:37:52,278
That's the way it's done, buddy boy.

1046
01:37:53,385 --> 01:37:55,649
More gracious Iiving?

1047
01:37:55,821 --> 01:38:00,053
Every one of you hates every one of us
and we hate you. Let's get at it.

1048
01:38:00,225 --> 01:38:01,487
Sure.

1049
01:38:01,660 --> 01:38:03,924
-Here we go.
-Come on.

1050
01:38:11,737 --> 01:38:13,728
-Come on, Ice.
-Come on.

1051
01:38:15,574 --> 01:38:18,099
-Hey, punch him in the face.
-Come on!

1052
01:38:18,277 --> 01:38:20,404
Keep your eyes open!

1053
01:38:21,280 --> 01:38:22,941
HoId it!

1054
01:38:25,117 --> 01:38:28,985
Tony! Get with the gang.
It's all okay.

1055
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:31,247
-No!
-What are you doing?

1056
01:38:31,423 --> 01:38:35,325
Maybe he has found the guts
to fight his own battIes.

1057
01:38:35,494 --> 01:38:40,522
It don't take guts if you got a battIe.
We ain't got one. None of us.

1058
01:38:40,699 --> 01:38:42,064
-Okay, Nardo?
-Tony!

1059
01:38:43,969 --> 01:38:48,963
HoId it! Let's just cooI it. The deaI
is a fair fight between you and Ice.

1060
01:38:49,141 --> 01:38:52,440
-Get with the gang.
-Mother hen protecting the IittIe one?

1061
01:38:52,611 --> 01:38:55,239
<i>-I'll give you a battIe, gallito.
-You've got one!</i>

1062
01:38:55,414 --> 01:39:00,943
I'll take pretty boy as a warm-up.
Afraid, pretty boy? Afraid, gutIess?

1063
01:39:01,119 --> 01:39:02,643
-Afraid, chicken?
-Cut it!

1064
01:39:02,821 --> 01:39:04,652
No!

1065
01:39:05,991 --> 01:39:08,391
-I don't wanna, Bernardo.
-Oh, I'm sure.

1066
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,289
-Now, Iisten.
-Are you chicken?

1067
01:39:10,462 --> 01:39:12,555
-There's nothing to fight about.
-The hell there ain't!

1068
01:39:12,731 --> 01:39:16,258
-You've got it wrong!
-Chicken!

1069
01:39:16,435 --> 01:39:19,199
-Why can't you understand?
-Understand, chicken!

1070
01:39:20,505 --> 01:39:22,200
-Kill him, Tony!
-Come on!

1071
01:39:22,374 --> 01:39:23,773
-Come on, man.
-Come on.

1072
01:39:23,942 --> 01:39:26,035
-Afraid to fight?
-Come on.

1073
01:39:26,211 --> 01:39:28,202
-Let me see you fight.
-What's the matter?

1074
01:39:28,380 --> 01:39:32,339
-Chicken boy!
-Hey! He is chicken!

1075
01:39:33,552 --> 01:39:37,010
-Pretty boy. Listen to him!
-Don't! Stop it!

1076
01:39:37,189 --> 01:39:39,020
We got nothing to fight about.

1077
01:39:39,191 --> 01:39:41,819
-Bernardo!
-Yellow-bellied chicken!

1078
01:39:41,994 --> 01:39:45,486
-Don't push me!
-Come on, you yellow-bellied PoIack!

1079
01:39:58,977 --> 01:40:02,572
-Riff! What are you doing?
-Get outta here, Tony!

1080
01:40:02,748 --> 01:40:05,945
-Riff, don't!
-HoId him!

1081
01:40:06,118 --> 01:40:07,380
Let me go!

1082
01:40:18,363 --> 01:40:20,194
Riff, don't!

1083
01:40:31,843 --> 01:40:34,607
Keep out of this!

1084
01:40:34,780 --> 01:40:36,509
Somebody stop him!

1085
01:40:36,681 --> 01:40:38,410
Let me go!

1086
01:40:39,217 --> 01:40:40,275
Ice!

1087
01:40:40,452 --> 01:40:42,317
Tiger!

1088
01:41:06,078 --> 01:41:07,773
Riff!

1089
01:41:07,946 --> 01:41:09,004
Riff!

1090
01:41:15,087 --> 01:41:18,022
-Come on, Nardo!
-Stop him!

1091
01:41:19,791 --> 01:41:21,418
Riff, don't!

1092
01:41:52,190 --> 01:41:54,181
Get them!

1093
01:43:24,082 --> 01:43:27,176
Maria!

1094
01:43:35,260 --> 01:43:37,626
Tony, come on! Come on, Tony!

1095
01:43:37,796 --> 01:43:40,390
We gotta get out of here! Come on!

1096
01:43:43,301 --> 01:43:45,599
Come on, Tony! Come on!

1097
01:43:45,770 --> 01:43:48,170
Get out of here!

1098
01:43:59,251 --> 01:44:00,912
Come on!

1099
01:44:06,691 --> 01:44:09,216
Come on, Tony!

1100
01:44:33,451 --> 01:44:35,544
Wait for me, Rosa.

1101
01:45:42,721 --> 01:45:44,484
Chino!

1102
01:45:44,656 --> 01:45:46,419
There was no one downstairs.

1103
01:45:47,559 --> 01:45:51,723
My mother and father are at the store.
I didn't expect you, or I wouId have--

1104
01:45:52,897 --> 01:45:56,424
-You have been fighting, Chino?
-Yes.

1105
01:45:57,035 --> 01:46:00,095
-I am sorry.
-That is not Iike you.

1106
01:46:00,271 --> 01:46:03,104
-No.
-You must go home and wash up.

1107
01:46:03,274 --> 01:46:05,834
-I will see you tomorrow.
-Maria, at the rumbIe--

1108
01:46:06,010 --> 01:46:08,001
-There was no rumbIe.
-There was.

1109
01:46:08,179 --> 01:46:12,343
-Oh, no. You are wrong.
-Nobody meant for it to happen.

1110
01:46:17,622 --> 01:46:18,884
Tell me.

1111
01:46:20,525 --> 01:46:21,958
It is bad.

1112
01:46:22,794 --> 01:46:24,056
Very bad?

1113
01:46:26,664 --> 01:46:28,598
You see....

1114
01:46:31,569 --> 01:46:35,027
It will be easier
if you say it very fast.

1115
01:46:35,440 --> 01:46:38,341
There was a fight.

1116
01:46:38,510 --> 01:46:40,569
And Nardo....

1117
01:46:40,745 --> 01:46:43,578
Somehow a knife....

1118
01:46:43,748 --> 01:46:47,411
-And Nardo and someone, they--
-Tony.

1119
01:46:47,585 --> 01:46:48,882
What happened to Tony?

1120
01:46:50,688 --> 01:46:53,987
Chino, tell me! Is Tony all right?

1121
01:46:56,961 --> 01:46:59,395
He killed your brother!

1122
01:47:06,438 --> 01:47:08,736
You are lying.

1123
01:47:08,907 --> 01:47:12,104
Chino, why do you Iie to me?

1124
01:47:12,777 --> 01:47:14,210
Chino!

1125
01:47:14,379 --> 01:47:15,368
Chino!

1126
01:47:15,547 --> 01:47:20,314
Chino, true, you are lying! Lying!
Why do you Iie to me, Chino?

1127
01:47:20,485 --> 01:47:22,919
-Chino!
-Mama! Mama!

1128
01:47:26,858 --> 01:47:28,291
No!

1129
01:47:35,033 --> 01:47:39,800
Santa Maria, make it not be true.
PIease make it not be true.

1130
01:47:39,971 --> 01:47:44,101
<i>Madre de Dios, I will do anything.
Make me die!</i>

1131
01:47:44,275 --> 01:47:47,244
Only, pIease, make it not be true.

1132
01:47:50,815 --> 01:47:52,783
Make it not be--

1133
01:47:57,255 --> 01:48:01,749
Killer! Killer! Killer! Killer!
Killer! Killer! Killer!

1134
01:48:06,631 --> 01:48:09,759
I tried to stop it.

1135
01:48:09,934 --> 01:48:11,424
I did try.

1136
01:48:11,603 --> 01:48:15,232
I don't know what went wrong.
I didn't mean to hurt him.

1137
01:48:15,406 --> 01:48:17,271
But Riff was Iike my brother.

1138
01:48:17,442 --> 01:48:21,936
When Bernardo killed him, Bernardo
didn't mean it either, I-- I know.

1139
01:48:25,016 --> 01:48:27,075
I thought you knew.

1140
01:48:31,256 --> 01:48:35,090
I didn't come to tell you that.
Just for you to forgive me...

1141
01:48:35,260 --> 01:48:37,091
...so I can go to the poIice.

1142
01:48:37,262 --> 01:48:39,127
-No!
-It'll be easy now.

1143
01:48:39,297 --> 01:48:40,730
-I won't Iet you!
-I must.

1144
01:48:40,899 --> 01:48:43,834
-Stay! Stay with me.
-Maria, I Iove you so much!

1145
01:48:44,002 --> 01:48:47,233
-Don't Ieave me!
-Whatever you want, I'll do.

1146
01:48:47,405 --> 01:48:49,839
-HoId me!
-Oh, forever!

1147
01:48:50,008 --> 01:48:53,637
-Tighter.
-It'll be all right. I know it.

1148
01:48:53,811 --> 01:48:56,177
We're really together now.

1149
01:48:56,548 --> 01:48:58,812
But it's not us.

1150
01:48:59,918 --> 01:49:02,409
It's everything around us.

1151
01:49:03,354 --> 01:49:06,687
Then I'll take you away,
where nothing can get to us.

1152
01:49:08,793 --> 01:49:11,660
Not anyone or anything.

1153
01:49:12,830 --> 01:49:18,234
<i>There's a place</i>

1154
01:49:18,403 --> 01:49:20,564
<i>For us</i>

1155
01:49:21,739 --> 01:49:24,071
<i>Somewhere</i>

1156
01:49:24,242 --> 01:49:27,507
<i>A place for us</i>

1157
01:49:28,212 --> 01:49:30,772
<i>Peace and quiet</i>

1158
01:49:30,949 --> 01:49:33,975
<i>And open air</i>

1159
01:49:34,419 --> 01:49:37,616
<i>Wait for us</i>

1160
01:49:37,789 --> 01:49:40,417
<i>Somewhere</i>

1161
01:49:43,127 --> 01:49:46,961
<i>There's a time</i>

1162
01:49:47,131 --> 01:49:49,065
<i>For us</i>

1163
01:49:49,233 --> 01:49:53,636
<i>Someday a time for us</i>

1164
01:49:53,805 --> 01:49:58,265
<i>Time together with time to spare</i>

1165
01:49:58,443 --> 01:50:02,743
<i>Time to look
Time to care</i>

1166
01:50:02,914 --> 01:50:05,474
<i>Someday</i>

1167
01:50:05,650 --> 01:50:08,175
<i>Somewhere</i>

1168
01:50:08,353 --> 01:50:13,017
<i>We'll find a new way of living</i>

1169
01:50:13,191 --> 01:50:18,060
<i>We'll find a way of forgiving</i>

1170
01:50:18,229 --> 01:50:21,392
<i>Somewhere</i>

1171
01:50:26,904 --> 01:50:32,433
<i>There's a place for us</i>

1172
01:50:32,610 --> 01:50:36,808
<i>A time and place for us</i>

1173
01:50:36,981 --> 01:50:41,509
<i>Hold my hand
And we're halfway there</i>

1174
01:50:41,686 --> 01:50:46,020
<i>Hold my hand
And I'll take you there</i>

1175
01:50:46,190 --> 01:50:48,886
<i>Somehow</i>

1176
01:50:49,060 --> 01:50:52,223
<i>Someday</i>

1177
01:50:52,397 --> 01:50:57,198
<i>Somewhere</i>

1178
01:51:54,992 --> 01:51:57,517
Baby John, what are you doing here?

1179
01:51:57,695 --> 01:51:59,458
Nothing.

1180
01:51:59,630 --> 01:52:02,895
What are you doing nothing here for?
Come on.

1181
01:52:03,067 --> 01:52:05,968
I don't want the guys to see me, A-rab.

1182
01:52:06,137 --> 01:52:07,729
Why not?

1183
01:52:08,172 --> 01:52:10,333
Well, I'm crying.

1184
01:52:11,409 --> 01:52:12,842
You are?

1185
01:52:14,512 --> 01:52:16,275
What for?

1186
01:52:16,447 --> 01:52:19,814
-I don't know. I'm just--
-BIow your nose.

1187
01:52:25,556 --> 01:52:28,423
-A-rab?
-Yeah?

1188
01:52:28,593 --> 01:52:31,187
Did you get a Iook at their faces?

1189
01:52:32,730 --> 01:52:35,460
-Which faces?
-You know....

1190
01:52:35,633 --> 01:52:38,659
At the rumbIe. Riff and Bernardo.

1191
01:52:39,537 --> 01:52:40,970
Yeah.

1192
01:52:43,808 --> 01:52:47,801
-I wish it was yesterday.
-Me too. I'm scared.

1193
01:52:47,979 --> 01:52:51,574
-Cut it out. You hear me?
-A-rab, what are we gonna do?

1194
01:52:51,749 --> 01:52:54,274
We'll meet the other guys and form up.

1195
01:52:54,452 --> 01:52:55,976
Now, come on. Let's go.

1196
01:52:56,154 --> 01:53:01,023
-Hey. You got a handkerchief first?
-What's wrong with your sIeeve?

1197
01:53:29,687 --> 01:53:32,155
-Where you been?
-Where you think? The Stork CIub?

1198
01:53:32,323 --> 01:53:34,257
-We thought they nabbed you.
-Go on.

1199
01:53:34,425 --> 01:53:37,326
-You didn't see Tony?
-Nothing but coppers.

1200
01:53:37,495 --> 01:53:40,862
-What's wrong with him?
-There's nothing wrong. He's okay!

1201
01:53:41,032 --> 01:53:42,522
All right, all right!

1202
01:53:42,700 --> 01:53:44,793
-Maybe we ought to go home.
-For what?

1203
01:53:44,969 --> 01:53:47,233
-Bet you they got him.
-Not Tony.

1204
01:53:47,405 --> 01:53:50,499
-Man, he was great. Right, Baby John?
-Yeah.

1205
01:53:50,675 --> 01:53:54,475
-He really come through for the Jets.
-Just Iike Riff said he--

1206
01:53:57,315 --> 01:53:59,783
Said he wouId.

1207
01:54:03,254 --> 01:54:06,655
Riff! I want Riff!

1208
01:54:06,824 --> 01:54:09,315
Come on, Graziella.

1209
01:54:09,861 --> 01:54:14,525
Gee. Nobody was
supposed to get killed.

1210
01:54:14,699 --> 01:54:16,166
It just....

1211
01:54:21,706 --> 01:54:23,071
They're gonna pay.

1212
01:54:23,241 --> 01:54:25,709
-Them stinking Sharks.
-Dirty fighting.

1213
01:54:25,877 --> 01:54:28,004
-They started it!

1217
01:54:35,953 --> 01:54:37,545
-Lay off him.
-Mind your business.

1218
01:54:37,722 --> 01:54:40,589
-Don't sound off on me. I'll hit--
-You'll do what?

1219
01:54:40,758 --> 01:54:41,918

Okay.

1270
02:00:01,245 --> 02:00:02,769
Let's go.

1271
02:00:42,553 --> 02:00:43,815
Where we going?

1272
02:00:43,988 --> 02:00:46,218
If we Iay Iow, the coppers
are gonna smell fish.

1273
02:00:46,390 --> 02:00:48,950
-So the first thing we do--
-Hey, buddy boys!

1274
02:00:49,126 --> 02:00:52,289
-Aw, go wear a skirt.
-I got scabby knees. Listen--

1275
02:00:52,463 --> 02:00:54,488
We show around
Iike we got nothing to hide.

1276
02:00:54,665 --> 02:00:56,292
Suppose they ask us about the rumbIe.

1277
02:00:56,467 --> 02:01:01,302
Suppose they ask where's Tony and what
party's Iooking for him? With a gun!

1278
02:01:01,472 --> 02:01:04,737
-You know something?
-I know I gotta go get a skirt.

1279
02:01:04,908 --> 02:01:07,103
-Come on!
-What's the freak know?

1280
02:01:07,278 --> 02:01:11,681
PIenty! I figured somebody ought to
infiItrate PR territory and spy around.

1281
02:01:11,849 --> 02:01:13,840
I'm very Iarge with shadows.

1282
02:01:14,018 --> 02:01:17,010
I can sIip in and out of them
Iike wind through a fence.

1283
02:01:17,187 --> 02:01:20,247
-Is she making the most of it!
-You bet your fat ''A'' I am!

1284
02:01:20,424 --> 02:01:22,085
-Spill it!
-Okay.

1285
02:01:22,259 --> 02:01:26,286
I hear Chino telling the Sharks
about Tony and Bernardo's sister.

1286
02:01:26,463 --> 02:01:30,593
Then I hear Chino say, ''If it's the Iast
thing I do, I'm gonna get that PoIack.''

1287
02:01:30,768 --> 02:01:32,895
And then he pulls out the bad news.

1288
02:01:33,070 --> 02:01:35,300
-Gee!
-Them PRs won't stop.

1289
02:01:35,472 --> 02:01:37,633
-Till we stop them.
-HoId it!

1290
02:01:37,808 --> 02:01:39,435
Now, Iisten...

1291
02:01:39,610 --> 02:01:42,841
...Tony come through for us.
We gotta come through for Tony.

1292
02:01:43,013 --> 02:01:45,573
-We gotta find him before Chino does.
-And burns him.

1293
02:01:45,749 --> 02:01:48,843
-You cover the river. Snowboy, Doc's.
-I'll take the alleys.

1294
02:01:49,019 --> 02:01:51,044
-We'll take the streets.
-The park.

1295
02:01:51,221 --> 02:01:52,415
-The schoolyard.
-The pIayground.

1296
02:01:52,589 --> 02:01:54,853
-Let's go.
-What about me?

1297
02:01:56,126 --> 02:01:58,856
You? In and out of the shadows.

1298
02:01:59,029 --> 02:02:01,896
-Maybe you'll find Tony in one of them.
-Right!

1299
02:02:02,066 --> 02:02:03,966
Hey!

1300
02:02:05,302 --> 02:02:06,963
You done good, buddy boy.

1301
02:02:08,138 --> 02:02:11,733
Thanks, daddy-o.

1302
02:03:14,405 --> 02:03:15,804
Who is--?

1303
02:03:18,675 --> 02:03:20,267
Maria.

1304
02:03:23,680 --> 02:03:25,147
Maria?

1305
02:03:25,749 --> 02:03:28,809
Maria, it's Anita. Are you in there?

1306
02:03:28,986 --> 02:03:30,613
-Maria?
-Yes.

1307
02:03:30,788 --> 02:03:33,120
Open the door. I need you.

1308
02:03:35,025 --> 02:03:36,356
No.

1309
02:03:41,265 --> 02:03:44,063
-Now you are afraid too?
-What?

1310
02:03:44,234 --> 02:03:45,929
I'll be right there.

1311
02:03:48,539 --> 02:03:51,702
We'll go. Meet me as soon as possibIe.
We'll run away.

1312
02:03:51,875 --> 02:03:55,333
-Together.
-But where?

1313
02:03:55,512 --> 02:03:58,310
The bus station.
We'll go so far they'll never find us.

1314
02:03:58,482 --> 02:04:01,417
-How can we?
-Doc will heIp. I'll get money from him.

1315
02:04:01,585 --> 02:04:03,780
-Meet me at his store.
-At Doc's, yes.

1316
02:04:03,954 --> 02:04:05,148
-I'll wait.
-All right.

1317
02:04:05,322 --> 02:04:09,190
-Maria.
-Yes.

1318
02:04:09,359 --> 02:04:10,690
Hurry!

1319
02:04:11,295 --> 02:04:14,423
-Maria!
-Coming, Anita.

1320
02:04:24,541 --> 02:04:26,008
Anita--

1321
02:04:40,357 --> 02:04:44,817
-All right. Now you know.
-And you still don't know.

1322
02:04:44,995 --> 02:04:46,292
He is one of them!

1323
02:04:46,463 --> 02:04:48,829
-No, Anita!
-Yes!

1324
02:04:50,934 --> 02:04:53,664
<i>A boy like that
Would kill your brother</i>

1325
02:04:53,837 --> 02:04:56,499
<i>Forget that boy

<i>One of your own kind

1330
02:05:16,593 --> 02:05:19,061
<i>A boy who kills cannot love</i>

1331
02:05:19,229 --> 02:05:21,857
<i>A boy who kills has no heart</i>

1332
02:05:22,032 --> 02:05:26,025
<i>And he's the boy who gets your love
And gets your heart</i>

<i>Very smart, Maria
Very smart</i>

<i>A boy like that
Wants one thing only</i>

1335

He'll leave you lonely</i>

1336
02:05:39,783 --> 02:05:42,877
<i>He'll murder your love
He murdered mine</i>

1337
02:05:43,053 --> 02:05:45,385
<i>Just wait and see
Just wait, Maria</i>

1338
02:05:45,556 --> 02:05:49,959
<i>-Just wait and see
-Oh, no, Anita, no</i>

<i>It isn't true, not for me</i>

<i>It's true for you, not for me</i>

1342
02:05:58,602 --> 02:06:02,834
<i>I hear your words
And in my head, I know they're smart</i>

1343
02:06:03,006 --> 02:06:07,033
<i>But my heart, Anita
But my heart</i>

1344
02:06:07,210 --> 02:06:09,371
<i>Knows they're wrong</i>

1345
02:06:09,546 --> 02:06:13,676
<i>You should know better

02:07:45,642 --> 02:07:48,372
<i>Be with him now</i>

1367
02:07:48,545 --> 02:07:50,877
<i>Tomorrow</i>

1368
02:07:51,048 --> 02:07:55,485
<i>And all</i>

1369
02:07:55,652 --> 02:07:59,452
<i>Of my life</i>

1370
02:08:14,738 --> 02:08:17,935
<i>When love comes</i>

1371
02:08:18,108 --> 02:08:20,668
<i>So strong</i>

1372
02:08:20,844 --> 02:08:26,578
<i>There is no right or wrong</i>

1373
02:08:26,750 --> 02:08:32,382
<i>Your love is</i>

1374
02:08:32,556 --> 02:08:37,516
<i>Your life</i>

1375
02:08:52,976 --> 02:08:54,910
Chino has a gun.

1376
02:08:55,078 --> 02:08:57,069
I heard the boys taIking.

1377
02:08:57,247 --> 02:09:01,650
-He's hunting for Tony.
-He's at Doc's store, waiting for me.

1378
02:09:01,818 --> 02:09:04,844
If Chino hurts him,
if he touches him, I swear I'll--

1379
02:09:05,021 --> 02:09:09,185
-You'll do what Tony did to Bernardo?
-I Iove Tony.

1380
02:09:09,559 --> 02:09:11,550
I know.

1381
02:09:12,028 --> 02:09:13,962
I Ioved Bernardo.

1382
02:09:21,805 --> 02:09:24,205
-Anybody home?
-Yes.

1383
02:09:25,776 --> 02:09:29,473
-Bernardo's sister, pIease.
-She isn't feeIing well.

1384
02:09:29,646 --> 02:09:31,614
Who is?

1385
02:09:33,884 --> 02:09:35,784
Hello, miss.

1386
02:09:35,952 --> 02:09:39,080
I'm Lt. Schrank. I don't Iike
to disturb you at a time Iike this--

1387
02:09:39,256 --> 02:09:42,623
Yes, a very bad time.
If you'll excuse me, pIease.

1388
02:09:42,793 --> 02:09:46,126
-I have a coupIe of questions to ask.
-Afterwards, pIease.

1389
02:09:46,296 --> 02:09:48,457
-I must go to my brother.
-One minute!

1390
02:09:48,632 --> 02:09:51,430
-Can't you wait?
-No!

1391
02:09:52,636 --> 02:09:53,898
Now.

1392
02:09:54,070 --> 02:09:57,369
-You were at the dance Iast night--
-Will this take Iong?

1393
02:09:57,541 --> 02:09:59,771
As Iong as it has to.

1394
02:10:00,477 --> 02:10:03,002
Excuse me.

1395
02:10:03,180 --> 02:10:05,341
Anita, my headache is much worse.

1396
02:10:05,515 --> 02:10:09,383
-Will you go to Doc's store?
-Don't you peopIe keep aspirin around?

1397
02:10:09,553 --> 02:10:11,987
This is something speciaI.

1398
02:10:13,623 --> 02:10:15,682
Will you go for me, Anita?

1399
02:10:21,264 --> 02:10:23,129
What shall I ask for?

1400
02:10:24,201 --> 02:10:26,169
Doc will know.

1401
02:10:26,336 --> 02:10:31,330
Tell him I have been detained
and can't get there right away...

1402
02:10:31,508 --> 02:10:34,068
...or I wouId have picked it up myseIf.

1403
02:10:44,788 --> 02:10:47,814
Excuse me. You were asking?

1404
02:10:49,025 --> 02:10:53,985
Yeah. At the gym Iast night, your
brother got into a heavy argument...

1405
02:10:54,164 --> 02:10:57,065
...because you danced
with the wrong boy.

1406
02:10:58,835 --> 02:11:02,236
-Yes.
-Who was the boy?

1407
02:11:03,039 --> 02:11:07,442
-Another from my country.
-And his name?

1408
02:11:08,211 --> 02:11:10,111
Jose.

1409
02:11:19,322 --> 02:11:21,984
-Can't find him.
-He's down there in the cellar.

1410
02:11:22,158 --> 02:11:23,523
-Tony?
-Safe and sound.

1411
02:11:23,693 --> 02:11:26,127
-I found him.
-You warn him about Chino?

1412
02:11:26,296 --> 02:11:29,732
-What's he doing in the cellar?
-Keeping the mice company.

1413
02:11:29,900 --> 02:11:32,095
-No sign of Chino?
-Nothing.

1414
02:11:32,269 --> 02:11:33,531
His Iuck.

1415
02:11:33,703 --> 02:11:36,194
I'll check the alleys again.
You hang here.

1416
02:11:36,373 --> 02:11:37,465
-Right.
-Okay.

1417
02:11:37,641 --> 02:11:42,044
-Boy, I'm thirsty. Where's Doc?
-Upstairs raising money for Tony.

1418
02:11:42,212 --> 02:11:44,476
-Doc ain't got no money.
-His mattress has.

1419
02:11:44,648 --> 02:11:48,448
Come on. Cut the frabber-jabber.
Grab some reading matter. PIay the juke.

1420
02:11:48,618 --> 02:11:52,486
Some of you get outside.
If you see Chino or those stinking PRs--

1421
02:12:03,800 --> 02:12:06,564
-I'd Iike to see Doc.
-He ain't here.

1422
02:12:07,470 --> 02:12:09,597
-Where is he?
-He went to the bank.

1423
02:12:09,773 --> 02:12:14,506
-They made a mistake in his favor.
-The banks are cIosed. Where is he?

1424
02:12:14,678 --> 02:12:18,512
You know how skinny Doc is. He sIipped
in through the night deposit sIot.

1425
02:12:18,682 --> 02:12:20,673
And got stuck haIfway in.

1426
02:12:20,850 --> 02:12:24,411
Which indicates there's
no telling when he'll be back.

1427
02:12:38,034 --> 02:12:39,331
Where you going?

1428
02:12:40,270 --> 02:12:44,468
-Downstairs.
-Didn't I tell you he ain't here?

1429
02:12:44,641 --> 02:12:46,700
I'd Iike to see for myseIf.

1430
02:12:49,245 --> 02:12:51,304
PIease.

1431
02:12:53,917 --> 02:12:55,908
PIease.

1432
02:12:59,489 --> 02:13:03,186
-Will you Iet me pass?
-She's too dark to pass.

1433
02:13:03,360 --> 02:13:05,123
-Don't.
-PIease don't.

1434
02:13:08,932 --> 02:13:10,923
-Listen, you!
-We're Iistening.

1435
02:13:11,101 --> 02:13:14,229
Look, I gotta give
a friend of yours a message.

1436
02:13:14,404 --> 02:13:16,235
-I gotta tell Tony--
-He ain't here.

1437
02:13:16,406 --> 02:13:17,737
-I know he is.
-Who says he is?

1438
02:13:17,907 --> 02:13:19,135
-Who's it from?
-Never mind.

1439
02:13:19,309 --> 02:13:24,645
-CouIdn't be from Chino, couId it?
-Don't you understand? I want to heIp!

1440
02:13:24,814 --> 02:13:28,375
-Bernardo's girI wants to heIp?
-Even a greaseball's got feeIings.

1441
02:13:28,551 --> 02:13:30,382
-But she wants to heIp get Tony.
-No!

1442
02:13:30,553 --> 02:13:34,216
-Not much. Bernardo's tramp.
-Bernardo's pig!

1443
02:13:34,391 --> 02:13:36,518
-You lying spic!
-Don't do that.

1444
02:13:36,693 --> 02:13:37,887
-GoId tooth!
-Pierced ear!

1445
02:13:38,061 --> 02:13:40,052
-Don't!
-GarIic mouth.

1446
02:13:42,766 --> 02:13:45,132
-I want to heIp!
-Come on!

1447
02:13:55,578 --> 02:13:57,045
Come on!

1448
02:14:01,351 --> 02:14:03,751
-Let's get her!
-Oh, no, you don't.

1449
02:14:07,257 --> 02:14:10,385
-Come on.
-Come on!

1450
02:14:15,799 --> 02:14:17,562
Stop it!

1451
02:14:22,005 --> 02:14:24,530
What are you doing there?

1452
02:14:43,460 --> 02:14:45,826
Bernardo was right.

1453
02:14:47,530 --> 02:14:52,797
If one of you was lying
in the street bIeeding...

1454
02:14:52,969 --> 02:14:55,631
...I'd waIk by and spit on you!

1455
02:14:55,805 --> 02:15:00,208
-She'll tell Chino Tony's in the cellar!
-Don't you touch me!

1456
02:15:02,946 --> 02:15:06,780
I got a message
for your American buddy.

1457
02:15:06,950 --> 02:15:11,444
You tell that murderer
that Maria's never going to meet him!

1458
02:15:11,621 --> 02:15:15,387
You tell him that Chino
found out about them...

1459
02:15:15,558 --> 02:15:17,685
...and shot her!

1460
02:15:18,361 --> 02:15:20,556
She's dead!

1461
02:15:24,367 --> 02:15:27,336
When do you kids stop?

1462
02:15:27,504 --> 02:15:30,962
You make this worId Iousy!

1463
02:15:31,141 --> 02:15:33,507
We didn't make it, Doc.

1464
02:15:35,044 --> 02:15:37,410
Get out of here.

1465
02:16:07,243 --> 02:16:08,904
Maria?

1466
02:16:09,078 --> 02:16:11,740
Doc, I thought I heard--
You got it!

1467
02:16:11,915 --> 02:16:15,351
-Yes, I got it.
-Doc, you're a paI.

1468
02:16:15,518 --> 02:16:20,148
You're the best friend a guy ever had.
I'll pay you back as soon as I can.

1469
02:16:20,323 --> 02:16:23,315
-Forget that.
-No, I'll never! I couIdn't.

1470
02:16:23,493 --> 02:16:26,587
You know what we're gonna
do in the country, Maria and me?

1471
02:16:26,763 --> 02:16:30,893
We'll have kids and name them after you.
Even the girIs, so when you visit--

1472
02:16:31,067 --> 02:16:32,967
Wake up!

1473
02:16:33,937 --> 02:16:37,304
Is this the only way
to get through to you?

1474
02:16:37,473 --> 02:16:41,773
Do just what you all do,
bust Iike a hot-water pipe?

1475
02:16:41,945 --> 02:16:43,310
What's got into you?

1476
02:16:43,479 --> 02:16:48,109
Why do you kids Iive
Iike there's a war on?

1477
02:16:51,321 --> 02:16:53,755
Why do you kill?

1478
02:16:57,093 --> 02:16:58,993
I toId you how it happened.

1479
02:17:00,563 --> 02:17:02,622
Maria understands.

1480
02:17:02,799 --> 02:17:07,168
-I thought you did too.
-Maria understands nothing.

1481
02:17:07,870 --> 02:17:09,531
Ever again.

1482
02:17:09,706 --> 02:17:12,334
There is no Maria, Tony.

1483
02:17:15,612 --> 02:17:16,874
What?

1484
02:17:18,715 --> 02:17:21,411
-I can't.
-No, no, Doc.

1485
02:17:21,584 --> 02:17:23,882
Now, tell me. What is it?

1486
02:17:24,921 --> 02:17:27,549
That was Anita upstairs.

1487
02:17:28,057 --> 02:17:31,458
Chino found out about you and Maria...

1488
02:17:32,395 --> 02:17:34,295
...and he killed her.

1489
02:17:48,411 --> 02:17:49,935
Maria....

1490
02:17:57,687 --> 02:17:59,382
Not Maria, Doc.

1491
02:18:00,657 --> 02:18:02,022
She's....

1492
02:18:09,065 --> 02:18:11,363
Chino! Chino!

1493
02:18:14,003 --> 02:18:16,471
Come and get me too, Chino!

1494
02:18:18,908 --> 02:18:21,069
Chino!

1495
02:18:23,046 --> 02:18:26,482
Chino!

1496
02:18:28,785 --> 02:18:32,983
-Chino! Come and get me too, Chino!
-Tony!

1497
02:18:33,156 --> 02:18:35,181
-Who's that?
-Anybodys. Come on.

1498
02:18:35,358 --> 02:18:36,848
Get out of here!

1499
02:18:37,026 --> 02:18:40,792
-Chino, come and get me, damn you!
-What are you doing?

1500
02:18:40,963 --> 02:18:43,056
Get out of here! Chino!

1501
02:18:43,232 --> 02:18:44,756
Come with me. We'll find--

1502
02:18:44,934 --> 02:18:47,061
It ain't pIaying anymore!
Can't you get that?

1503
02:18:47,236 --> 02:18:51,434
-But the gang--
-You're a girI! Be a girI and beat it!

1504
02:18:55,278 --> 02:18:57,178
Chino!

1505
02:18:58,247 --> 02:19:01,774
Come on, Chino! Get me too!

1506
02:19:01,951 --> 02:19:03,680
Chino!

1507
02:19:15,064 --> 02:19:18,465
Chino! I'm calling for you, Chino!

1508
02:19:19,302 --> 02:19:23,500
There's nobody here but me.
Come on!

1509
02:19:23,673 --> 02:19:25,436
PIease, will you?

1510
02:19:27,043 --> 02:19:28,806
I'm waiting for you.

1511
02:19:29,612 --> 02:19:31,307
I want you to.

1512
02:19:42,125 --> 02:19:43,422
Maria?

1513
02:19:44,727 --> 02:19:46,024
Tony!

1514
02:19:49,165 --> 02:19:50,598
Maria.

1515
02:19:55,805 --> 02:19:57,033
Maria!

1516
02:19:59,242 --> 02:20:00,504
Maria!

1517
02:20:27,303 --> 02:20:30,101
I didn't beIieve hard enough.

1518
02:20:30,273 --> 02:20:32,571
Loving is enough.

1519
02:20:32,742 --> 02:20:34,437
Not here.

1520
02:20:35,445 --> 02:20:39,848
-They won't Iet us be.
-Then we'll get away.

1521
02:20:43,352 --> 02:20:44,751
Yeah.

1522
02:20:44,921 --> 02:20:46,115
-We can.
-Yes.

1523
02:20:46,289 --> 02:20:48,519
-We will.
-Yes.

1524
02:20:49,559 --> 02:20:54,121
<i>Hold my hand
And we're halfway there</i>

1525
02:20:57,333 --> 02:21:03,431
<i>Hold my hand
And I'll take you there</i>

1526
02:21:03,606 --> 02:21:05,471
<i>Somehow</i>

1527
02:21:05,641 --> 02:21:08,735
<i>Someday</i>

1528
02:21:08,911 --> 02:21:10,606
<i>Some....</i>

1529
02:21:51,320 --> 02:21:52,651
Stay back!

1530
02:22:13,676 --> 02:22:16,611
How do you fire this gun, Chino?

1531
02:22:16,779 --> 02:22:19,976
Just by pulling this IittIe trigger?

1532
02:22:20,149 --> 02:22:22,845
How many bullets are Ieft, Chino?

1533
02:22:23,252 --> 02:22:24,776
Enough for you?

1534
02:22:24,954 --> 02:22:26,319
And you?

1535
02:22:27,924 --> 02:22:29,255
All of you!

1536
02:22:29,425 --> 02:22:33,623
You all killed him.
And my brother and Riff.

1537
02:22:33,796 --> 02:22:36,287
Not with bullets and guns.

1538
02:22:36,465 --> 02:22:38,456
With hate!

1539
02:22:38,801 --> 02:22:42,931
Well, I can kill too
because now I have hate!

1540
02:22:43,105 --> 02:22:46,370
How many can I kill, Chino? How many?

1541
02:22:46,542 --> 02:22:49,375
And still have one bullet Ieft for me?

1542
02:22:56,085 --> 02:22:58,519
No!

1543
02:23:11,167 --> 02:23:14,159
Don't you touch him!
