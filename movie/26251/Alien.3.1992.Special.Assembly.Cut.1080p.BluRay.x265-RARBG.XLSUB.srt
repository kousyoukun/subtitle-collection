But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley

didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,

It might also be helpful...

if you kept me informed as to any change in her physical status.

193
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:54,160

Or would that be asking too much?

194
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,600
- ʬ������  - ��˵

We'll keep the bodies on ice till the rescue team arrives.

- On ice. - There is the public health issue.

197
00:23:04,210 --> 00:23:06,100

The lieutenant feels that there

198
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,220
�м���������Ⱦ�Ŀ���
is still a possibility of a communicable infection.

I thought you said there was no sign of disease.

200
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,760

It would appear that the child drowned.

201
00:23:15,850 --> 00:23:18,390
����δ���������Ҽ��
But without the benefit of proper laboratory tests,

202
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,390
��Ҳ����ʮ�ֿ϶�
it's impossible to be absolutely certain.

203
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:23,730
����Ϊð�ű���Ⱦ�Ŀ�����
I would consider it unwise to tolerate even

204
00:23:23,810 --> 00:23:26,570

the possibility of an unwelcome virus.

205
00:23:26,650 --> 00:23:31,110

An outbreak of cholera would look extremely bad on a report.

Would it not, sir?
