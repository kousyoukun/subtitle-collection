坠落此地

生还者是个女人

50
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:44,230
漂亮吗?
That's what I saw.

51
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,920
我想说我已经发誓 要终生禁欲
I just want to say that I've taken a vow of celibacy.

52
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:49,300
- 我们都发誓过 - 包括对女人在内
- So have we all. - That also includes women.

53
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:51,510
- 是的 - 我们全都发过誓
- Yes. - We've all taken the vow!

54
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:54,260
- 闭上你的臭嘴 - 我要说的 第一点
- Shut your gob, Morse. - I'd like to say that I, for one,

55
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:56,850
我不喜欢公司政策...
do not appreciate company policy allowing her to freely...

56
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:59,060
让她和囚犯及域卒 混在一起
intermingle with inmates and the rest of the staff.

57
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:03,810
这位兄弟想说的是 任何外人
What brother means to say is we view the presence of any outsider,

58
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:08,530
尤其是一个女人 都会破坏这里
especially a woman, as a violation of the harmony,

59
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:10,530
和谐统一的精神
a potential break in the spiritual unity.

60
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,240
我们知道 大家的想法
We are well aware of your feelings in this matter.

61

我已申请救援小组前来

若无阻碍 一周内将到达
Hopefully, they will be here inside of a week-

63
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,790
然后尽快将她带离此地
Oh, come on! and evacuate her A.S.A.P.

64
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,800
少来这一套!
Don't give us that!

65
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,760
她的身体状况如何?
What's her medical status?

66
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,760
伤势不重
She doesn't seem too badly damaged.

67
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,680
目前昏迷中 未能做更精确诊断
She's unconscious. Can't give you a more specific diagnosis at the moment.

68
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,140
- 她能活下来吗? - 我想应该会
- Will she live? - I would think so.

69
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,890
大家都不希望...
Look. It's in everybody's interest...

70
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:44,690
那女人在救援小组到达前 离开医疗室
the woman doesn't come out of the infirmary until the rescue team arrives.

71
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,940
- 没人伴随更不可以 对吗? - 是
- And certainly not without an escort, right? - Sir.

72
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:54,530
各位 我们必须坚守日常生活...
Gentlemen, we should all stick to our set routine...

73
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,780
不要过度激动
and not get unduly agitated.

74
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,370
对吧?
Right. Correct?

75

他们最好早点到 否则她就死定了
Better get here soon or there ain't gonna be much left.

78

What's that?

79
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:56,590
我自己调的鸡尾酒 给你前所未有的感受
It's just a little cocktail of my own mix. Sort of eye-opener.

80
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:59,100
你是医生?
You a doctor?

81
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:02,720
我叫克里蒙斯 这里的医疗主任
My name is Clemens. I'm the chief medical officer here.

82
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,850
- 这里? - 复仇161星
- Here? - Fury 161.

83

银河系最偏远的劳动监狱
It's one of Weyland-Yutani's backwater work prisons,

84
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,320
一提起就令我伤心
it grieves me to say.

85
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,320
别紧张
Do you mind?

86
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:19,030
这东西是镇静剂
This is basically a stabilizer.

87
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:22,040
我得剃掉你的头发
I really ought to shave your head.

88
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,620
这里的头虱很多
We have a big problem with lice here.

89
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,210
等你感觉好点 我帮你剪发
And when you're feeling better, I'll give you some clippers,

90
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,340
- 你自己剪耻毛 - 我是怎么来的?
- and you can tend to your private parts yourself. - How'd I get here?

91
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,470
你乘坐的逃生艇坠毁
You crash-landed in an E.E.V.

92
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:40,050
进入大气层前 才脱离你的母船
Evidently separated from your mother ship before you hit our atmosphere.

93
00:13:40,140 --> 00:13:43,470
知道你长眠多久吗?
You have any idea how long you were in hypersleep?

94
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:46,180
你突然苏醒 可能对身体有影响
'Cause coming out the way you did can be quite a jolt to the system.

95
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:48,770
- 我会病几个星期 - 没错
- Yeah, I'll be sick for a couple of weeks. - Indeed.

96
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:55,610
- 其他人呢? - 全死了
- Where are the others? - They didn't make it.

97
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,780
- 什么? - 无一幸存

98
00:14:02,490 --> 00:14:04,870
我要到船上
I have to get to the ship.

99
00:14:04,950 --> 00:14:08,040
- 我要到船上 - 你现在还不能去
- Have to get to the ship. - You're in no condition for that.

100
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,000
给我穿衣服 还是你要我这样出去?
You want to get me some clothes, or should I just go like this?

101
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:16,920
考虑到本地居民的性情 我建议你穿衣服
Given the nature of our indigenous population, I would suggest clothes.

102
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:21,890
他们好久没见过女色
None of them have seen a woman in years.

103
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,630
我也一样
Neither have I, for that matter.

104
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:32,340
这里曾经收容五千名囚犯
This used to be a 5,000 convict facility,

105
00:14:32,430 --> 00:14:36,060
现在却只有25名
but it's been reduced to a custodial staff of 25.

106
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,100
为什么?
Why?

107
00:14:37,180 --> 00:14:40,880
- 保持火焰不熄 - 什么火焰?
- Keep the pilot light on. - The pilot light for what?

108
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,860
封闭式熔炉 天然沼气
Blast furnace. Natural methane.

109
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:48,570
我们有个铸造厂 蕾普丽中尉
We have a foundry, Lieutenant Ripley.

110
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:52,030
囚犯打造铅片 围堵有毒废物
The inmates forge lead sheets for toxic waste containers.

111
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,870
你怎么知道我的名字?
How do you know my name?

112
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:57,740
就写在你短裤背面
It's stenciled on the back of your shorts.

113
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:09,300
把铁缆松开!
Release the cable!

114
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,900
- 尸体在哪里? - 在殓房
- Where are the bodies? - We have a morgue.

115
00:15:29,030 --> 00:15:32,950
调查小组一个星期后到达
We put them there until the investigative team arrives in about a week, I think.

116
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:39,290
- 有一名生化人 - 残缺不全
- There was a droid. - Disconnected.

117
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,870
到处都是碎片
There were bits and pieces of him all over the place.

118
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,040
我们把残骸丢到垃圾场
We put what was left on the rubbish tip.

119
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:47,500
那名下士 被安全支架刺死
The corporal was impaled by that safety support.

120
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,550
死得不明不白
He never knew what hit him.

121
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,010
那个女孩呢?
And the girl?

122
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:55,430
她...溺死在低温舱内
She drowned in her cryo-tube.

123
00:15:55,510 --> 00:15:59,930
我想她没有知觉... 当她死去时
I don't think she was conscious when it happened.

124
00:16:00,020 --> 00:16:03,190
很抱歉
Um, I'm sorry.

125
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:24,790
怎么了?
What's the matter?

126
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,290
- 她在哪里? - 在停尸间
- Where is she? - In the morgue.

127
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:30,300
我要看她
I have to see her.

128
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,630
我要看看她的遗体
I have to see what's left of her.

129
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,680
为何你这么坚持?
Is there any particular reason that you're so insistent?

130
00:16:42,770 --> 00:16:46,900
对 我要确定她的死因
Yes. I have to be sure how she died.

131
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:50,070
对这种事情 实在不必罗唆
I hate to be repetitious about such a sensitive subject,

132
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:54,280
但她很明显是溺死的
but it is persectly clear that she drowned.

133
00:16:58,570 --> 00:17:00,580
她是你女儿吗?
Was she your daughter?

134
00:17:02,910 --> 00:17:05,960
不 她不是
No. She wasn't.

135
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:50,470
让我独处一下 好吗?
C-Could I have a moment alone, please?

136
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:52,520
当然可以
Yes, of course.

137
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
原谅我
Forgive me.

138
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,540
她在干嘛?
What's she doing?

139
00:19:06,550 --> 00:19:09,050
你没事吧?
Okay?

140
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,350
没事
No.

141
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:14,310
我们得验尸
We have to do an autopsy.

142
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:16,140
- 什么? - 我说过了
- What? - I told you,

143
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,480
我们得查清楚她的死因
we have to make sure how she died.

144
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:23,190
我说过 她是溺死的
And I told you, she drowned.

145
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:28,820
我不敢肯定 我们得看看她的体内
I'm not so sure. I-I have to see inside of her.

146
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:31,320
你精神恍惚
You're disorientated. Half your system's still in-

147
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,410
我有很好的理由
I have a very, very good reason.

148
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:35,580
那就请你把理由告诉我
Well, perhaps you'd like to share that reason.

149
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:41,710
她很可能受到感染
Possible contagion.

150
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:44,670
哪种感染?
What kind exactly?

151
00:19:44,760 --> 00:19:46,760
- 霍乱 - 霍乱?
- Cholera. - Cholera?

152
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:53,390
两百年来 一宗霍乱病例都没有
There hasn't been a case of cholera reported for 200 years.

153
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,980
求求你
Please.

154
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,480
一切正常
Everything's in place.

155
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:44,940
没有感染的迹象
There's no sign of infection.

156
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,730
- 没有疾病的征状 - 胸腔
- No indication of disease. - Chest.

157
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,780
打开胸腔
Open the chest.

158
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,290
小心点
Careful.

159
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:33,990
肺部
Lungs.

160
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:38,370
充满液体
Flooded with fluid.

161
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,500
所以她是溺死的
Ergo, she drowned.

162
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:53,470
我不是白痴
Now, since I'm not a complete idiot,

163
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:57,390
请告诉我 你到底在找什么?
would you like to tell me what we're really looking for?

164
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:08,650
克先生
Mr. Clemens.

165
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,650
狱长
Superintendent.

166
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,740
你还没见过蕾普丽中尉
I don't believe you've met Lieutenant Ripley.

167
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,820
这是怎么回事 克先生?
What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

168
00:22:17,910 --> 00:22:20,030
是的 长官 怎么了?
That's right, sir. What's going on, Mr. Clemens?

169
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:23,410
首先
Well, first-

170
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:28,330
我很高兴蕾普丽中尉 已经觉得好很多
the lieutenant is feeling much better, I'm happy to say.

171
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,880
另外 基于公共卫生
Second, in the interest of public health,

172
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,670
- 我正在验尸 - 没有我的同意?
- I am performing an autopsy. - Without my authority.

173
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:36,180
我来不及向你请示
Well, there didn't seem to be time.

174
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:38,140
结果一切无碍
But it's turned out all right.

175
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,680
- 没有感染 - 很好
- There's no sign of contagion in the body. - Good.

176
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:44,520
蕾中尉最好别在囚犯面前走动
But it might be helpful if Lt. Ripley didn't parade around in front of the prisoners,

177
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,730
听说她已经这么做过
as I am told she did in the last hour.

178
00:22:46,810 --> 00:22:48,730
这对我很有帮助...
It might also be helpful...

179
00:22:48,810 --> 00:22:51,860
她的状况若有变化 你也要让我知道
if you kept me informed as to any change in her physical status.

180
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,020
这要求过分吗?
Or would that be asking too much?

181
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:59,820
- 尸体必须火葬 - 胡扯 我们要保存尸体 直到救援小组到达
- We have to cremate the bodies. - Nonsense. We'll keep the bodies on ice till the rescue team arrives.

182
00:22:59,910 --> 00:23:04,290
- 冷藏保存 - 这会影响公共卫生
- On ice. - There is the public health issue.

183
00:23:04,370 --> 00:23:09,380
蕾中尉认为目前 仍有传染病存在的可能
The lieutenant feels that there is still a possibility of a communicable infection.

184
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,710
你不是说没有疾病征状?
I thought you said there was no sign of disease.

185
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,920
这孩子看来是溺死的
It would appear that the child drowned.

186
00:23:16,010 --> 00:23:18,550
不过未经化验
But without the benefit of proper laboratory tests,

187
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,550
是不可能完全确定的
it's impossible to be absolutely certain.

188
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,890
我认为不该忽视...
I would consider it unwise...

189
00:23:22,970 --> 00:23:26,730
感染病毒的可能
to tolerate even the possibility of an unwelcome virus.

190
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:31,270
要是霍乱突然蔓延 你一定会面目无光
An outbreak of cholera would look extremely bad on a report.

191
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,690
是不是 长官?
Would it not, sir?

192
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:37,780
这所监狱的25名囚犯
We've 25 prisoners in this facility.

193
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,950
全都有双Y染色体
All double-y-chromos.

194
00:23:40,030 --> 00:23:44,240
全是小偷 强奸犯 杀人犯 全都是人渣
All thieves, rapists, murderers, child molesters. All scum.

195
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:49,080
他们信教 并不代表他们很安全
Just because they've taken on religion doesn't make them any less dangerous.

196
00:23:49,170 --> 00:23:51,580
我不干涉他们的信仰
I try not to offend their convictions.

197
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:54,170
也不想扰乱这里的秩序
I don't want to upset the order.

198
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,760
我不想引发风波
I don't want ripples in the water.

199
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:02,850
我也不让女人勾起他们的邪念
And I don't want a woman walking around giving them ideas.

200
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:06,980
我懂了 为我自身安全着想
I see. For my own personal safety.

201
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,100
一点也没错
Exactly.

202
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:14,820
我把火葬的事交给你 克先生
I will leave the details of the cremation to you, Mr. Clemens.

203
00:24:17,190 --> 00:24:21,240
他们可以用熔炉 不过十点以前要回牢房
They may use the furnace, but I want everyone back in lockup by 2200 hours.

204
00:24:21,320 --> 00:24:23,370
我保证
You called it, sir.

205
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:52,900
- 圣诞节提早到来 - 什么意思?
- Ah, Christmas has come early, Murph. - What do you mean?

206
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:56,980
- 有死牛就是好的 - 没错
- Any dead ox is a good ox. - You're bloody right.

207
00:24:57,070 --> 00:24:59,320
满身跳蚤的臭东西
Smelly bastards, all covered in lice.

208
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,410
现在只剩下七只 就算处理完了
There's only seven of the friggin' things left, and then we're done with them.

209
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:05,780
最讨厌冲洗这臭东西
God, I hates hosin' these bastards down.

210
00:25:05,870 --> 00:25:08,330
每次搞得我浑身是粪
I always get shite all over me boots.

211
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,580
说起臭东西 对了 法兰克
Talkin' of hosing things down, Frank- Yeah?

212
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:14,250
有机会的话 你想跟她说什么?
You had the chance, what would you say to her?

213
00:25:14,330 --> 00:25:16,540
- 什么意思? - 你知道的
- What do you mean, if I got the chance? - You know.

214
00:25:16,670 --> 00:25:19,460
有机会的话 你是说平常的时候吗?
If you got the chance. You mean, casual like?

215
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:23,800
对 要是在饭堂遇到 你会说什么?
Yeah. I mean, how would you put it to her if you bumped into her in the mess hall or somewhere?

216
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,760
没问题!
No problem!

217
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:29,930
我对女人很有办法
I've never had any problem with the ladies.

218
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:32,940
我会说"午安 亲爱的 好吗?
I'd say to her, "Good day, my dear. How's it goin'?

219
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,610
我可以帮你做什么吗? "
Anything I can do to be of service?"

220
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:38,690
然后看着她 从上看到下
Then I'd give her the look, you know- up and down.

221
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:42,110
然后眨眼睛 色迷迷的笑
And I'd give her the wink, the dirty smile.

222
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:44,700
- 她就会明白 - 没错
- She'd soon get the picture. - Yeah, right.

223
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,450
她就会说 "来亲我吧 老色鬼"
And then she'd say, "Kiss my ass, you horny old fucker!"

224
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:51,200
我会去亲她
I'd be happy to kiss her ass.

225
00:25:51,290 --> 00:25:54,250
我会去亲她 浑身上下
I'd be happy to kiss her anywhere she wants.

226
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:59,170
- 对 但要粗暴点 激烈点 明白吗? 法兰克 - 告诉你 墨菲
- Yeah, but treat 'em mean, keep 'em keen. Right, Frank? - Told you before, Murph.

227
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:03,010
把女王当妓女 把妓女当是女王
Treat a queen like a whore and a whore like a queen.

228
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,530
不会错的
Can't go wrong.

229
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:09,680
那女孩是怎么死的?
What do you think killed Babe?

230
00:26:09,770 --> 00:26:12,350
不知道 反正已归西
Beats me. She just keeled over.

231
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,020
- 她多大? - 11岁吧
- How old was she? - The charts say 1 1 .

232
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,150
正值青春 算了
In her prime. Never mind.

233
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:24,070
- 等一下切碎了 一样要丢进炉里 - 对
- We'll chop her up later and throw her in the stew. - Right.

234
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,240
法兰克
Hey, Frank.

235
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,830
那是什么?
What's this?

236
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:36,310
"这孩子...
"We commit this child...

237
00:27:36,390 --> 00:27:39,980
"和这男人 已离开我们的世界
"and this man to your keeping, O Lord.

238
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:43,230
"他们的肉身...
"Their bodies...

239
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,360
"已远离黑暗
"have been taken from the shadow of our nights.

240
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:53,910
"他们获得解脱...
"They have been released...

241
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:58,120
远离黑暗与痛苦"
from all darkness and pain."

242
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,460
"这孩子和这男人...
"The child and the man...

243
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:10,130
"已离开我们的世界
"have gone beyond our world.

244
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:14,010
"他们已达到永恒...
"They are forever eternal...

245
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:16,310
"永垂不朽
"and everlasting.

246
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,990
尘归尘 土归土"
Ashes to ashes, dust to dust."

247
00:28:30,030 --> 00:28:32,820
为什么?
Why?

248
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,620
为什么无辜者受到惩罚?
Why are the innocent punished?

249
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:45,130
为什么必须牺牲?
Why the sacrifice?

250
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,510
为什么有痛苦?
Why the pain?

251
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:55,180
世间原无承诺
There aren't any promises.

252
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:59,390
世事无常
Nothing's certain.

253
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,610
少数人能蒙主宠召 得到拯救
Only that some get called, some get saved.

254
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:09,490
她不会了解我们留在人世...
She won't ever know the hardship and grief...

255
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,320
必须面对的困苦和伤痛
for those of us left behind.

256
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:15,950
我们将遗体交托于虚无...
We commit these bodies to the void...

257
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,490
并且满心欢喜
with a glad heart.

258
00:29:28,510 --> 00:29:31,420
因为每一颗种子
For within each seed,

259
00:29:31,510 --> 00:29:33,970
必将长出花朵
there is a promise of a flower.

260
00:29:35,970 --> 00:29:40,020
每次死亡
And within each death,

261
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:44,350
无论多么微不足道
no matter how small,

262
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:46,690
总有一个新生命
there's always a new life.

263
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:53,400
一个新的开始
A new beginning.

264
00:29:56,910 --> 00:29:59,160
阿门
Amen.

265
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:04,370
阿门
Amen.

266
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:36,070
真奇怪
I'll tell you, it's fucking weird.

267
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,820
唯一生还者是女人
The only one to survive that crash is a woman.

268
00:30:38,910 --> 00:30:41,030
她会制造什么麻烦?
What trouble can she cause?

269
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,040
她已经改变这里了
She's already changed everything.

270
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,880
我们他妈的该怎么
What the fuck are we supposed to do-

271
00:30:54,970 --> 00:30:57,970
第一点
I, for one-

272
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,600
我不是开玩笑!
I mean it!

273
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,180
好了
Okay.

274
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:47,220
很多谣言说这里不很和谐
There's a lot of talk going around that we've got some disharmony here?

275
00:31:47,810 --> 00:31:51,060
可以告诉我是什么问题吗?
Any you guys want to tell me what the problem is?

276
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,610
告诉我 兄弟
Come on. Speak to me, brothers.

277
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:00,450
我告诉你
All right. I'll tell ya.

278
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:04,990
我不怕黑暗和虫子
I don't mind the dark. I don't mind the bugs.

279
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:09,160
也不怕每周一次 走进又湿又冷的隧道中
I don't mind wanderin' around in some cold, wet, damp tunnel for a week at a time.

280
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,920
我什么也不怕 但我讨厌葛立
I don't mind anything. But I mind Golic.

281
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,390
是这样吗?
That the way you feel about it?

282
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,560
对 他又臭又疯疯癫癫
Yeah. The guy's crazy and he smells bad.

283
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,230
我不要再和他一起出去
I ain't going out with him anymore.

284
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:29,950
你有什么话要说?
You got anything to say for yourself?

285
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:36,410
他还是得跟着你们
Well, he's going with you.

286
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:41,420
葛立只是个可怜的废人 和你我没有不同
Golic is just another poor, miserable, suffering son of a bitch, just like you and me.

287
00:32:41,550 --> 00:32:43,710
- 他很臭 - 还疯疯癫癫
- 'Cept he smells worse. - And he's crazy.

288
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:46,260
少跟我来这套!
Knock off the shit!

289
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:50,390
你们有事要做
You got a job to do.

290
00:32:50,470 --> 00:32:54,100
我不要再听到 任何有关葛立的事
I don't want to hear another word about Golic.

291
00:32:55,980 --> 00:33:00,940
知道吗?
Okay?

292
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:19,540
你好
Well, hello.

293
00:33:58,500 --> 00:34:01,920
亚伦先生 如我所想
As I thought, Mr. Aaron.

294
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,210
- 如我所想  - 你作主吧 长官
- As I thought. - You called it, sir.

295
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:16,930
我只想 谢谢你在葬体说的话
I just wanted to, uh, say thanks for what you said at the funeral. It was, uh-

296
00:34:18,810 --> 00:34:20,680
我的朋友一定会很感激
My friends would have appreciated it.

297
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:23,560
你不会想认识我 小姐
Yeah, well, you don't wanna know me, lady.

298
00:34:23,650 --> 00:34:27,730
我是专杀女人的强奸犯
I'm a murderer and rapist of women.

299
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:31,860
真的?
Really?

300
00:34:33,490 --> 00:34:37,410
我猜我一定令你很紧张
Well, I guess I must make you nervous.

301
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,510
- 你有任何信仰吗 妹子? - 谈不上
- Do you have any faith, sister? - Not much.

302
00:34:56,600 --> 00:35:01,480
这里有很足够的信仰 甚至足够让你加入
Well, we've got a lot of faith here. Enough even for you.

303
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,490
我以为女人不准加入
I thought women weren't allowed.

304
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:06,790
以前从未有过女人
Well, we've never had any before,

305
00:35:06,870 --> 00:35:10,130
不过我们容忍任何人
but we tolerate anybody.

306
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:15,240
- 甚至令人无法容忍的人 - 谢谢
- Even the intolerable. - Thank you.

307
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:19,990
这只是原则 不是针对你
That's just a statement of principle. Nothing personal.

308
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,410
在这里等待最好
You see, we've got a good place to wait here.

309
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:27,130
直到现在...没有任何诱惑
And until now, no temptation.

310
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:34,190
你们在等什么?
What are you waiting for?

311
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:47,600
等上帝回来...
We're waiting for God to return...

312
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:51,530
救赎我们
and raise his servants to redemption.

313
00:35:53,610 --> 00:35:58,620
五年前迪伦和其他人...
Dillon and the rest of the alternative people...

314
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:03,250
接受宗教信仰
embraced religion, as it were, about five years ago.

315
00:36:03,370 --> 00:36:06,460
- 再喝一杯 - 我正在服药
- Tincture? - I'm on medication.

316
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:09,040
- 不见得吧 - 哪一种宗教?
- Hardly. - What kind of religion?

317
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:14,550
某种相信千年末世的 基督教原教旨主义派
Some sort of apocalyptic, millenarian, Christian fundamentalist, uh-

318
00:36:14,670 --> 00:36:17,010
- 对 - 正是
- Right. - Exactly.

319
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,930
问题是公司想关闭监狱
Point is, when the company wanted to close the facility down,

320
00:36:20,010 --> 00:36:23,680
迪伦和其他人希望留下
Dillon and the rest of the converts wanted to stay.

321
00:36:23,770 --> 00:36:27,900
他们获准以守卫身份留下...
And they were allowed to remain as custodians...

322
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:30,900
加上两名管理员...
with two minders...

323
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,650
和一名医疗主任
and a medical officer.

324
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:35,820
就是我们
And here we are.

325
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:38,200
你怎么得到这么好的差事?
How did you get this wonderful assignment?

326
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:43,810
你喜欢这新发型吗?
How do you like your new haircut?

327
00:36:45,330 --> 00:36:47,250
还算好
It's okay.

328
00:37:04,350 --> 00:37:08,060
我为了你 得罪安德鲁
Now that I've gone out on a limb for you with Andrews,

329
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:11,400
我和那号人的关系 现在更加恶化
damaged my already less-than-perfect relationship with that good man,

330
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:13,900
我也向你说过...
and briefed you...

331
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:17,820
复仇161星的无聊历史
on the humdrum history of Fury 161 ,

332
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,280
可否告诉我 在女孩体内找什么?
can you not tell me what you were looking for in the girl?

333
00:37:20,370 --> 00:37:23,410
觉得我有吸引力吗?
You attracted to me?

334
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:25,580
哪一方面?
ln what way?

335
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,750
"那"方面
ln that way.

336
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,090
你很直接
Very direct.

337
00:37:35,130 --> 00:37:37,460
我流浪了很久
I've been out here a long time.

338
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:42,050
我也是
So have I.

339
00:37:46,270 --> 00:37:51,690
# In the year 7510 #

340
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,940
# If God's a-comin' #

341
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,690
# He oughta make it by then #

342
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,360
# Maybe he'll look around and say #

343
00:38:01,450 --> 00:38:04,740
# Guess it's time for the Judgment- #

344
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,350
恶心!
Yech!

345
00:38:32,650 --> 00:38:34,650
# In the year #

346
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:44,660
嘿 史派克!
Hey, Spike. Spike? Spikey!

347
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:53,040
你在下面吗? 在做什么?
Are you down there? What are you doing?

348
00:39:37,540 --> 00:39:40,130
蒙你垂青我真的很感激
I really appreciate your affections,

349
00:39:42,050 --> 00:39:45,050
但我注意到 你回避我的问题
but I am aware that they... deflected my question.

350
00:39:47,010 --> 00:39:49,970
当然你用的方法很巧妙
In the nicest possible way, of course.

351
00:39:53,730 --> 00:39:55,890
你真扫兴
You're spoiling the mood.

352
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,820
我得尽我的职责
I have a job to do.

353
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,780
我只想知道为何要火葬
I just want to know why we had to cremate the bodies.

354
00:40:02,860 --> 00:40:05,740
你认为既然上了你的床
And now that I'm in your cot,

355
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:08,200
就应该回答你
you think I owe you an answer.

356
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,990
你得给我一个理由
I think you owe me an answer.

357
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:13,290
但这与上不上床无关
Being in my bed's got nothing to do with it.

358
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:21,630
我在长眠期间发了可怕的梦
I had a terrible dream in hypersleep.

359
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:24,460
我得知道是什么害死她
And I had to be sure what killed her.

360
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,800
我可能错了
Anyway, I made a mistake.

361
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,680
有可能
Possibly.

362
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,810
现在我又犯了错
And now I've made another mistake.

363
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:35,810
真的? 什么错?
Really? What's that?

364
00:40:35,890 --> 00:40:38,520
和囚犯搞关系
Fraternizing with a prisoner.

365
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:42,980
肉体接触 这触犯规律 对吧?
Physical contact. It's against the rules, isn't it?

366
00:40:43,070 --> 00:40:47,200
当然 几时发生的?
Definitely. When was this?

367
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,870
你应该很清楚
l think you know.

368
00:40:55,030 --> 00:40:57,080
我不是囚犯
I'm not a prisoner.

369
00:40:59,040 --> 00:41:02,210
你脑后有一个电脑条码
You have a bar code on the back of your head.

370
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:09,170
那的确应该解释
That does deserve an explanation.

371
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,180
不过现在还未到时候
But I don't think now is the moment.

372
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:20,390
对不起 我令你觉得扫兴
Sorry. We are rather spoiling things, aren't we?

373
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,600
克先生
Mr. Clemens.

374
00:41:26,020 --> 00:41:29,820
- 亚伦先生 - 狱长安德鲁 要你...
- Mr. Aaron. - Superintendent Andrews would like you to report...

375
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:33,610
马上到22号通风孔
to vent shaft 22 on the second quadrant- now.

376
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:35,780
- 发生了意外 - 严重吗?
- We've had an accident. - Something serious?

377
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:41,200
可以这么说 有一名囚犯...被切碎了
You could call it that. One of our prisoners has been... diced.

378
00:41:41,290 --> 00:41:45,040
抱歉 得走了
Sorry. I have to go.

379
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,420
有职务在身
Official duties.

380
00:42:17,740 --> 00:42:21,290
- 是谁那么倒霉? - 墨菲
- Who was it? - Murphy.

381
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:23,370
你怎么知道的?
How do you know?

382
00:42:23,460 --> 00:42:25,960
那是他的靴子
That's his boot.

383
00:42:27,630 --> 00:42:30,420
是我派他来的 他是个笨蛋
I gave him the assignment, sir. He was a wanker.

384
00:42:30,510 --> 00:42:33,520
别自责 亚伦先生 不是你的错
No apologies, Mr. Aaron. It wasn't your fault.

385
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,900
没什么好说的
Well, not much to say, is there?

386
00:42:46,980 --> 00:42:50,020
- 他当场死亡 - 可不是
- Death was instantaneous. - No shit.

387
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:52,480
我猜他被吸入风扇
I take it he was pulled into the fan.

388
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,530
突然而来的一阵风
Sudden rush of air, I'd imagine, except-

389
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,700
对 我也差点被卷进风扇
Right. Almost happened to me once.

390
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:01,160
我说过多少次 离风扇远点
I've told him so many times, "Stay away from the fans."

391
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,160
没有人肯听
Nobody bloody listens.

392
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:06,370
除了风扇一直吹着
Except the fan was blowing.

393
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,420
- 那是什么? - 不知道
- What's that? - I don't know.

394
00:43:15,510 --> 00:43:20,300
半小时后来见我 克先生
I want to see you in my quarters in 30 minutes, if you'll please, Mr. Clemens.

395
00:43:25,810 --> 00:43:28,690
你有头绪吗?
Have you got any ideas?

396
00:44:13,570 --> 00:44:17,320
你在这儿 你一个人到处乱走...
Here you are. You know, wandering around without an escort...

397
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:21,240
会气死安德鲁
is really gonna piss Superintendent Andrews off.

398
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:23,660
那件意外是怎么回事?
Will you tell me about your accident?

399
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,370
一名囚犯死了
One of the prisoners has been killed.

400
00:44:27,500 --> 00:44:29,830
真的? 怎么死的?
Really? How? Hmm.

401
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:32,460
在通风孔
In the air shaft.

402
00:44:32,540 --> 00:44:35,050
可怜的家伙 掉进9尺长的风扇
Poor soul backed into a nine-foot fan.

403
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:38,550
我在离现场不远
I found something at the accident site,

404
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:42,050
发现一样东西
just a bit away from where it happened.

405
00:44:42,140 --> 00:44:45,720
一个印痕 烧过的痕迹
A mark. A burn.

406
00:44:47,220 --> 00:44:50,100
就像你在那女孩的低温舱 所发现的
Rather like the one you found on the girl's cryo-tube.

407
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:00,400
听着 我跟你同一阵线
Look. I'm on your side.

408
00:45:00,490 --> 00:45:03,990
我想帮你 但我要知道这是怎么回事...
I want to help, but I need to know what's going on...

409
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,450
或是 你认为这是怎么回事
or what you think is going on.

410
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:11,080
若你想帮我
lf you really wanna help,

411
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:13,330
就找一部语音电脑...
find me a computer with audio capabilities...

412
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:15,540
让我解读航行记录器
so I can access this flight recorder.

413
00:45:15,630 --> 00:45:17,750
这里没有那种设备
We don't have anything like that here.

414
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,050
- 主教呢? - 主教?
- Well, what about Bishop? - Bishop?

415
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:22,630
跟我一起坠机的生化人?
The droid that crashed with me.

416
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:25,100
我只能指给你看
I can point you in the right direction.

417
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:27,180
不能陪你去
I can't join you.

418
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,480
我和别人有约
I have a previous engagement.

419
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:35,900
掉下来了 葛立 不要乱弄
This'll top you up. Golic, don't fidget.

420
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:40,860
怎么会这样? 根本没有包好
What's all this shit? It's not properly wrapped.

421
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,070
- 他笨头笨脑 - 只会吃
- What the hell does he ever do right? - Eat.

422
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:45,490
- 脑满肠肥 - 葛立!
- He's got that down pretty good. - Golic!

423
00:45:45,570 --> 00:45:49,660
- 你为墨菲点枝蜡烛 - 我会点很多支
- You light a candle for Murphy. - I'll light a thousand.

424
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:54,670
他真好
He was special.

425
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:58,040
从未抱怨过
Never complained about me once.

426
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,170
我喜欢他
I loved him.

427
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:06,090
真的是那样吗?
Is it true what they say?

428
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:08,510
他的头被打碎了?
His head split into a million pieces?

429
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:11,350
谁有火柴?
Okay. Who's got the matches?

430
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:18,190
- 克先生 请坐 - 谢谢
- Sit down, Mr. Clemens. - Thank you.

431
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:22,990
- 加糖? - 不用
- Sugar? - Uh, no thanks.

432
00:46:23,110 --> 00:46:25,610
- 加奶? - 一点点
- Milk? - Just a little, please.

433
00:46:29,370 --> 00:46:31,410
谢谢 亚伦先生
Thank you, Mr. Aaron.

434
00:46:41,170 --> 00:46:43,420
给我听好 你这浑蛋
Listen to me, you piece of shit.

435
00:46:43,510 --> 00:46:46,380
你再耍我 我就斩开你两半
You screw with me one more time, I'll cut you in half.

436
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,680
对不起 我听不懂
I'm sorry. I don't think I understand.

437
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,810
七点我接到总公司的消息
At 0700 hours, I received word from the network.

438
00:46:52,890 --> 00:46:55,730
据我所知 那是这儿...
I may point out this is the first high-level communication...

439
00:46:55,810 --> 00:46:59,940
收到的第一份高阶层讯息
this installation has ever received, to my knowledge.

440
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,900
他们要我们看牢这女人
They want this woman looked after.

441
00:47:02,030 --> 00:47:04,740
- 她是最高优先考虑 - 为什么?
- They consider her to be very high priority. - Why?

442
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:07,110
我也不知道
l have no idea.

443
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,490
你为何让她离开医疗室?
But why did you let her out of the infirmary?

444
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:12,740
墨菲发生意外 是因为...
This accident with Murphy is what happens...

445
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,830
你让人满脑子歪念乱跑
when one of these dumb sons of a bitches walks around with a hard-on.

446
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:18,630
我是医生 你是狱卒
I'm a doctor. You're the jailer.

447
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:24,010
我们都知道你的真面目
We both know exactly what you are.

448
00:47:24,130 --> 00:47:27,260
坐下 我认为我最好离开
Sit down. I think it might be better if I left.

449
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:31,050
在你身边令我非常不愉快
I find you... unpleasant to be around.

450
00:47:31,140 --> 00:47:34,520
是吗? 你要想想 克先生
You do? Isn't that lovely? Consider this, Mr. Clemens.

451
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,690
你要我把你的臭史...
How would you like me to explain your sordid history...

452
00:47:37,770 --> 00:47:40,020
告诉你的新朋友吗?
to your newfound friend?

453
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:43,900
为了她个人的想法
For her personal edification, of course.

454
00:47:43,980 --> 00:47:46,610
给我坐下来
Now sit the hell down.

455
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,330
我不喜欢你 你喜怒无常
I don't like you. You're unpredictable.

456
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:03,210
傲慢无理 也可能很危险
Insolent. Possibly dangerous.

457
00:48:03,300 --> 00:48:06,170
你对任何事都有疑问!
You question everything!

458
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,720
如果这里不需要医疗主任
If I didn't need a medical officer,

459
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:11,050
我马上要你滚蛋
I wouldn't let you within light years of this operation.

460
00:48:11,140 --> 00:48:14,350
- 我感激不尽 - 少讲风凉话
- I'm eternally grateful. - Keep your sarcasms to yourself.

461
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:18,430
现在...我该知道什么事?
Now, is there anything I should know?

462
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:22,270
- 关于什么? - 那女人
- About what? - About the woman.

463
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:25,900
少骗我 你几乎随时在她旁边
Don't play with me, Mr. Clemens. You spend every second you can with her.

464
00:48:25,990 --> 00:48:29,490
鬼才相信你是为了治疗
And I have my suspicions not all of your concerns with her are medical.

465
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:38,750
她跟你说过什么? 她从哪里来? 有什么任务?
Has she said anything to you- anything about where she's from, what her mission is?

466
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:41,000
为什么会在逃生艇内?
What the hell she was doing in an E.E.V.?

467
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:43,880
她说她们打了败仗
She told me she was part of a combat unit that came to grief.

468
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:46,460
我想其他都是机密
Beyond that, I assume it's all classified.

469
00:48:46,550 --> 00:48:49,880
我没再给她压力
I haven't pressed her for more.

470
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,970
- 就这样? - 就这样
- That's all? - That's all.

471
00:48:52,090 --> 00:48:54,140
- 真的吗? - 对
- You're sure? - Yes.

472
00:48:54,260 --> 00:48:57,350
- 没有了? - 没有
- Nothing more? - No.

473
00:49:01,020 --> 00:49:03,060
滚出去
Get out of here.

474
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:54,220
闭嘴 婊子!
Shut up, you fuckin' bitch!

475
00:50:54,300 --> 00:50:56,680
- 进去! - 闭嘴 贱人!
- Get in there! - Shut up, you bitch!

476
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,930
- 没人听得见你 - 他妈的 放开我!
- Nobody's gonna hear you. - Goddamn it, let go of me!

477
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,600
去你的! 不!
Fuck you! No!

478
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:06,730
不要动
Hold still! Shh! Shh!

479
00:51:06,810 --> 00:51:08,560
不! 见鬼!
No! Goddamn it!

480
00:51:16,450 --> 00:51:18,490
你没事吧?
You okay?

481
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:22,790
你这王八蛋
No! Son of a bitch!

482
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:32,550
快走 我得重新教育几位弟兄
Take off. I gotta reeducate some of the brothers.

483
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,470
谈一下心灵改革的问题
We've gotta discuss some matters of the spirit.

484
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,980
香烟!
Cigarettes!

485
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:07,910
干吧
So let's do it.

486
00:52:13,710 --> 00:52:16,760
这里有十条街这么长
This is like 1 0 city blocks.

487
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:25,260
- 有多少? - 这是第176个
- How many? - This makes 1 76.

488
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,930
吃东西小声点
Can't you chew a little quieter?

489
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,190
我正在算这区段有多大
I'm trying to figure out how big this compartment is.

490
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:33,060
你这么吵我无法思考
I can't think with all this goddamn noise you're making.

491
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:36,030
- 别说脏话 - 对不起
- You're not supposed to swear. - I'm sorry.

492
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:40,530
- 我们绕行过整个区段 - 嘿!
- Now, we've encircled this entire compartment once- - Hey.

493
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:43,070
干嘛?
What?

494
00:52:47,040 --> 00:52:49,000
什么狗屁玩意?
What the shit is doing that?

495
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:50,830
- 说脏话 - 闭嘴
- Swearing. - Shut up.

496
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,420
说"狗屁"没关系 我又没骂上帝
It's all right to say "shit." It ain't against God.

497
00:52:53,500 --> 00:52:55,880
蜡烛怎么了?
What the hell is going on with the candles?

498
00:53:00,340 --> 00:53:03,180
一定是附近通风孔
Must be the wind from one of the vent shafts.

499
00:53:03,260 --> 00:53:06,060
吹来的逆风
Backwash from the closest circulating unit.

500
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,140
要是蜡烛都被吹熄 我们怎么知道位置?
But if all the candles go out, how the hell we gonna know where we are?

501
00:53:09,230 --> 00:53:12,520
只好派人回去 重新点亮
Somebody will just have to go back and relight them.

502
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,400
我去吧
I guess I'm nominated.

503
00:53:25,080 --> 00:53:27,740
小心点 兄弟
Watch your step, brother.

504
00:53:36,840 --> 00:53:40,630
好了 谁在开玩笑?
Okay, who are the comedians?

505
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,600
等等 等等!
Wait, wait, wait!

506
00:54:28,680 --> 00:54:30,850
- 快跑 快 抓住 - 救我 救我!
- Quick, grab it. Here. - Help me! Help me!

507
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,690
走! 快走!
Go! Fuckin' go!

508
00:54:37,610 --> 00:54:41,070
走 走 快点!
Go, go, go! Quick! Run!

509
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:52,290
拿来!
Gimme that!

510
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:34,620
把这臭东西弄掉!
Get this fucking thing off me!

511
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,910
操!
Oh, fuck!

512
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,960
放开我!
Let me go!

513
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:39,060
嘿
Hey.

514
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:42,650
蕾普丽
Ah, Ripley.

515
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:46,360
嗨 主教 你感觉如何?
Hi, Bishop. How you feeling?

516
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,400
我的腿很痛
My legs hurt.

517
00:56:48,490 --> 00:56:50,700
我很难过
Uh, listen, I'm sorry.

518
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:53,370
没关系 我只是个烤面包机
It's okay. I'm just a glorified toaster.

519
00:56:53,450 --> 00:56:55,450
你还好吗?
How are you?

520
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:59,080
我喜欢你的新发型
I like your new haircut.

521
00:56:59,160 --> 00:57:01,820
你能查出航行记录器资料?
Bishop, can you access data on the flight recorder?

522
00:57:01,900 --> 00:57:03,070
没问题
No problem.

523
00:57:29,150 --> 00:57:31,490
葛立?
Golic?

524
00:57:35,940 --> 00:57:39,500
- 好了 - 苏拉可号发生什么事?
- I'm home. - What happened on the Sulaco?

525
00:57:39,580 --> 00:57:42,210
低温舱为何弹射出来?
Why were our cryo-tubes ejected?

526
00:57:42,290 --> 00:57:44,830
静态平衡受干扰
Stasis interrupted.

527
00:57:44,920 --> 00:57:48,800
低温舱起火
Fire in cryogenic compartment.

528
00:57:48,920 --> 00:57:52,380
- 重覆 低温舱... - 怎么回事?
- Repeat. Fire in cryogenic - What happened?

529
00:57:52,470 --> 00:57:55,010
怎么起火的?
What started the fire, Bishop?

530
00:57:55,100 --> 00:57:57,100
你听得到吗?
Can you hear me?

531
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:00,390
电线短路
The fire was electrical.

532
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,730
地板的材料烧起来
lt was in the subflooring.

533
00:58:03,810 --> 00:58:07,400
救生船脱离母舰前 有没有东西在舰上?
Did the sensors pick up anything moving around on the ship prior to separation?

534
00:58:07,480 --> 00:58:10,940
这儿好暗 蕾普丽 我的视力大不如前
It's very dark here, Ripley. I'm not what I used to be.

535
00:58:11,030 --> 00:58:15,410
告诉我 记录器有没有显示?
Just tell me. Does the recorder indicate anything?

536
00:58:15,490 --> 00:58:17,950
舰上有没有异形?
Was there an alien on board?

537
00:58:19,450 --> 00:58:21,250
有
Yes.

538
00:58:24,580 --> 00:58:28,710
它还在苏拉可号 还是和我们一起坠机?
Is it on the Sulaco or did it come with us on the E.E.V.?

539
00:58:28,800 --> 00:58:32,090
它一直都和我们一起
It was with us all the way.

540
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,400
公司知不知道?
Does the company know?

541
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:53,690
公司知道舰上的每一件事
The company knows everything that happened on the ship.

542
00:58:53,780 --> 00:58:58,160
一切都输入电脑 传回总公司
It all goes into the computer and gets sent back to network.

543
00:58:58,240 --> 00:59:00,200
他们还是要异形
And they want it.

544
00:59:00,290 --> 00:59:05,580
帮个忙 切断电源
I hurt. Do me a favor. Disconnect me.

545
00:59:05,670 --> 00:59:09,750
就算我被修好 也无法回复正常
I could be reworked, but I'll never be top of the line again.

546
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,500
我宁愿消失
I'd rather be nothing.

547
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,090
你肯定?
You're sure?

548
00:59:16,840 --> 00:59:19,470
就当为我好吧 蕾普丽
Do it for me, Ripley.

549
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,490
不是我 不是我干的!
It wasn't me! I didn't do it!

550
00:59:37,570 --> 00:59:41,700
是...是那一条龙
It was- It was the dragon.

551
00:59:41,790 --> 00:59:43,950
吸食人的心灵
Feeds on minds. It was-

552
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:46,410
- 谁也无法阻挡 - 伯格和雷恩呢?
- Nobody can stop it. - What about Boggs and Rains?

553
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,830
- 全像猪一样被宰了 - 不是我!
- They got s-slaughtered like pigs. - It wasn't me!

554
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:53,670
- 不是我 - 他完全疯了
- It wasn't me! - Stark raving mad.

555
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,420
早该用铁炼锁住
I'm not saying it was anyone's fault, but he should have been chained up.

556
00:59:56,510 --> 00:59:59,840
你说得对 长官 他发疯了
You called it, sir. Mad as a fucking hatter.

557
00:59:59,930 --> 01:00:03,720
把他隔离 别引起恐慌
Keep him separated from the rest. I don't want him causing a panic.

558
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:06,380
克里蒙斯 让这白痴安静下来
Clemens, sedate this poor idiot. Yeah?

559
01:00:06,460 --> 01:00:08,480
我们得先弄清楚弟兄的下落
Not until we know about the brothers.

560
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:12,400
振作一点 告诉我
Now, now. Pull yourself together. Talk to me now.

561
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,400
- 伯格和雷恩在哪里? - 不是我!
- Now, where are Boggs and Rains? - It wasn't me!

562
01:00:15,490 --> 01:00:17,360
没有用 问不出来的
Hopeless. You're not gonna get anything out of him.

563
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:20,320
- 不是我! - 我们得派出搜索队
- It wasn't me. - We'll have to send out a search team.

564
01:00:20,410 --> 01:00:22,740
我恐怕有很大几率...
I'm afraid we'll have to assume there's a very good chance...

565
01:00:22,830 --> 01:00:25,160
这畜牲会杀了他们
this simple bastard has murdered them.

566
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,420
你还不知道
Now, you don't know that.

567
01:00:30,420 --> 01:00:33,170
他没骗过我
He's never lied to me.

568
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:36,510
他是个疯疯癫癫的傻子 不过他不会说谎
He's crazy, he's a fool, but he's not a liar.

569
01:00:38,550 --> 01:00:40,880
他说的是实话
He's telling the truth.

570
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:44,100
我想跟他谈谈这条龙
I'd like to talk to him about this- this dragon.

571
01:00:44,180 --> 01:00:47,140
- 那是一条龙 - 你别想跟任何人说话 中尉
- It was a dragon. - You're not talking to anyone, Lieutenant.

572
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:50,100
我对你的意见没兴趣
I'm not interested in your opinion,

573
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,310
你根本搞不清状况
because you are not in full possession of the facts.

574
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:55,940
他曾犯下多宗杀人案 是个残忍的凶手
This man is a convicted multiple murderer, known for particularly brutal crimes.

575
01:00:56,030 --> 01:00:58,690
对不对 迪伦先生?
Isn't that right, Mr. Dillon?

576
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:01,570
对...那是真的
Yeah. That part's right.

577
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:06,490
那我就和你谈 这很重要
Then I'll talk to you. lt's important.

578
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:09,000
我完成职务后
When I have finished with my official duties,

579
01:01:09,080 --> 01:01:12,210
很乐意和你谈
I will be quite pleased to have a little chat, yes?

580
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:21,970
让我弄清楚 中尉 这生物有8尺高
Let me see if I have this correct, Lieutenant. It's an eight-foot creature of some kind,

581
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:26,310
血液是强酸 坐你的太空船到达此地
with acid for blood, and it arrived on your spaceship.

582
01:01:26,390 --> 01:01:29,890
它见人就杀 性情不太友善
It kills on sight and is generally unpleasant.

583
01:01:29,980 --> 01:01:32,520
你当然期望我信你的话
And, of course, you expect me to accept all this on your word.

584
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:34,980
不 我不期望任何事
No, I don't expect anything.

585
01:01:35,070 --> 01:01:39,900
- 故事很精彩 亚伦先生 - 是的 很精彩
- Quite a story, Mr. Aaron. - Right, sir. It's a beauty.

586
01:01:39,990 --> 01:01:42,950
- 我没听过这种故事 - 我想也没有
- Never heard anything quite like it, sir. - Expect not.

587
01:01:43,030 --> 01:01:45,120
告诉我 你建议我们怎么做?
Tell me, Lieutenant, what would you suggest we do?

588
01:01:47,490 --> 01:01:49,910
你们有什么武器?
Well, what kind of weapons have you got?

589
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:52,000
这是监狱
This is a prison.

590
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:54,540
不能让囚犯碰武器
It's not a good idea to allow prisoners access to firearms.

591
01:01:54,630 --> 01:01:56,420
以免他们杀了你?
What keeps them from killing you?

592
01:01:56,500 --> 01:01:59,460
是的 它根本逃不出去
Fear. There's no way to escape.

593
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:03,510
下一班补给船到达时 公司会派人消灭它
With the arrival of the next supply ship, the company would eliminate them.

594
01:02:03,590 --> 01:02:07,470
这是个最高设防的监狱
This is a maximum security prison,

595
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:12,680
你们却没有任何武器?
and you have no weapons of any kind?

596
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:18,770
屠宰场有几把屠刀 饭堂也有
We have some carving knives in the abattoir. A few more in the mess hall.

597
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:22,280
还有几把消防斧头 没有太多厉害武器
Some fire axes scattered about the place. Nothing terribly formidable.

598
01:02:22,360 --> 01:02:23,650
只有这些?
That's all?

599
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,490
我们推行荣誉制度
We're on the honor system.

600
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:35,710
- 我们完蛋了 - 不 只有你完蛋了
- Then we're fucked. - No, you're fucked.

601
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:39,170
我把你关在医疗室
Confined to the infirmary. Quarantined.

602
01:02:39,250 --> 01:02:41,960
亚伦先生会护送你去
Mr. Aaron will escort you.

603
01:02:42,050 --> 01:02:46,340
你在那儿最安全 对吗?
I think you'll be safe from any large, nasty beast while you're there, right?

604
01:02:48,350 --> 01:02:51,520
这才乖
Yes, that's a good girl.

605
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:58,190
全体到饭堂报到
Let's all report to the mess hall.

606
01:02:58,270 --> 01:03:02,280
狱长安德鲁要开会 立刻到饭堂报到
Superintendent Andrews wants a meeting. Mess hall, right away, people.

607
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:06,450
能不能离开? 有办法逃生?
Isn't there any way off of this place? Some way to escape?

608
01:03:06,530 --> 01:03:10,280
补给船每六个月来一次
No. Supply ship comes every six months.

609
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:12,370
- 只有这样? - 是的
- And that's it? - Mm-hmm.

610
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:15,290
可恶
Fuck.

611
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:19,630
很快就有人来接你
They are sending somebody to pick you up quite soon, I gather.

612
01:03:19,710 --> 01:03:22,500
很快是多快?
Really.What's "soon"?

613
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:27,260
不知道 以前没有人急着来这里
I don't know. Nobody's ever been in a hurry to get here before.

614
01:03:29,930 --> 01:03:32,850
跟我说 安德鲁和你谈些什么?
Do you want to tell me what you and Andrews talked about?

615
01:03:32,930 --> 01:03:35,180
不
No.

616
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:39,310
你会说我疯了
You'll just say I'm crazy.

617
01:03:39,400 --> 01:03:45,360
这么说有点不厚道
That's a bit uncharitable.

618
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,490
你感觉如何?
How are you feeling?

619
01:03:50,580 --> 01:03:54,700
不太好
Not so hot.

620
01:03:54,790 --> 01:03:56,710
喉咙痛
Sore throat.

621
01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:00,710
胃部不舒服 而且气坏了
Sick to my stomach. Pissed off.

622
01:04:00,790 --> 01:04:04,670
在这种情况下我能了解
Well, that's understandable given the circumstances.

623
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:08,220
也许我 该给你打一剂特别的药
Perhaps I should give you one of my special cocktails.

624
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,140
为什么大家都互相指责?
I don't know why everybody blames everybody for everything.

625
01:04:11,220 --> 01:04:13,640
人非圣贤 我们只是凡人
Nobody's persect, only human.

626
01:04:15,850 --> 01:04:18,140
没有一个人是完美的
There's no such thing as a perfect human.

627
01:04:18,230 --> 01:04:21,310
这里是疯狂世界
In an insane world,

628
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,860
正常人...
a sane man...

629
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:28,400
也要变成疯子
must... appear... insane.

630
01:04:28,490 --> 01:04:32,070
- 讲得真好 葛立 - 谢谢
- That's very profound, Golic. - Thank you.

631
01:04:37,830 --> 01:04:40,710
你结婚了吗?
You married?

632
01:04:40,790 --> 01:04:43,380
- 我? - 你应该结婚生子
- Me? - You should get married, have kids.

633
01:04:43,460 --> 01:04:48,670
你这么漂亮 我曾认识很多漂亮女孩
Pretty girl. I used to know lots of 'em back home.

634
01:04:48,760 --> 01:04:51,640
她们很喜欢我
They used to like me.

635
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:56,100
过一阵子就变心
For a while.

636
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:03,110
你也会死的
You're gonna die too.

637
01:05:11,160 --> 01:05:14,870
- 你有没有? - 什么?
- Are you? - What?

638
01:05:14,950 --> 01:05:17,200
结婚
Married.

639
01:05:17,290 --> 01:05:19,710
干嘛?
Why?

640
01:05:19,790 --> 01:05:23,040
- 只是好奇 - 没有
- Just curious. - No.

641
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:31,220
- 你也坦白点 如何? - 讲清楚一点
- How about leveling with me? - Could you be more specific?

642
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,930
你没说你为何被派来这里
When I asked how you got assigned here, you avoided the question.

643
01:05:35,010 --> 01:05:38,220
我提到你脑后的监狱识别条码
And then when I asked about the prison I.D. tattooed on the back of your head,

644
01:05:38,310 --> 01:05:40,180
你又顾左右而言他
you ducked me again.

645
01:05:43,150 --> 01:05:45,360
说来话长 令人伤心...
lt's a long, sad story...

646
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:48,900
而且通俗煽情
and more than a little melodramatic.

647
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:51,360
说来听听
Try me.

648
01:05:53,360 --> 01:05:55,870
既然你这么想听
If you insist.

649
01:06:00,580 --> 01:06:02,910
我毕业以后
After my student years,

650
01:06:04,040 --> 01:06:07,000
虽然我已经...
despite the fact that I had become...

651
01:06:07,090 --> 01:06:09,500
对吗啡上瘾
secretly addicted to morphine,

652
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:11,840
我仍被认为是
I was considered to be most promising,

653
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:14,380
最有前途的医生
a man with a future.

654
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:21,680
我当专科实习医生 在急诊室当值36小时
And during my first residency, I did a 36-hour stretch on an E.R.

655
01:06:22,940 --> 01:06:26,480
我跑出去 喝得酩酊大醉
So, I went out and I got more than a little drunk.

656
01:06:26,560 --> 01:06:28,730
然后我又被召回
Then I got called back.

657
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,980
一座炼油厂的蒸汽炉爆炸
Boiler had blown on a fuel plant,

658
01:06:31,070 --> 01:06:34,150
30名伤者
and there were 30 casualties.

659
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,570
11人死亡
And 1 1 of them died.

660
01:06:36,660 --> 01:06:38,830
不是因为意外...
Not as a result of the accident...

661
01:06:38,910 --> 01:06:41,370
而是因为我开错止痛药剂量
but because I prescribed the wrong dosage of painkiller.

662
01:06:43,500 --> 01:06:47,500
我服刑七年 执照被降为3C
I got seven years in prison and my license reduced to a 3-C.

663
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:52,800
至少我戒掉吗啡瘾
At least I got off the morphine.

664
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:55,050
很遗憾
l'm sorry.

665
01:06:56,800 --> 01:06:58,970
我的惩罚还算轻
l think I was let off lightly.

666
01:06:59,060 --> 01:07:01,970
你在这里服刑?
Did you serve your time here?

667
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:07,060
我和这群乌合之众混熟了
I got to know this motley crew quite well.

668
01:07:07,150 --> 01:07:11,020
他们留下来 我也留下了
So when they stayed, I stayed.

669
01:07:12,440 --> 01:07:14,780
没有人愿意聘用我
Nobody else would employ me.

670
01:07:18,200 --> 01:07:21,950
你还愿意让我打针吗?
So, do you still trust me with a needle?

671
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,540
很好
Magnificent.

672
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:00,590
主呀 给我们力量来坚守
Give us strength, O Lord, to endure.

673
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:05,220
我们只是上帝手中 卑微的罪人
We recognize that we are poor sinners in the hands of an angry God.

674
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:09,640
请以手包围我们 守护我们
Let the circle be unbroken until the day. Amen.

675
01:09:09,770 --> 01:09:13,230
- 阿门 - 这里出了什么事?
- Amen. - What the fuck is happening here?

676
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:18,070
出了这么一大堆事情
What the fuck is this bullshit that's comin' down?

677
01:09:18,150 --> 01:09:21,150
有人死了 有人要强暴 弟兄出了麻烦
We got murder. We got rape. We got brothers in trouble.

678
01:09:21,240 --> 01:09:25,620
不要再闹事了!
I don't want no more bullshit around here!

679
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:30,410
出了问题 我们要团结
Now, we got problems, we stand together.

680
01:09:30,500 --> 01:09:33,330
是的 谢谢 迪伦先生
Yes. Thank you, Mr. Dillon. All right.

681
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:36,550
再一次 这是谣言管制会议
Once again, this is rumor control.

682
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:39,170
以下是案情
Here are the facts.

683
01:09:39,260 --> 01:09:41,930
早上八点 囚犯墨菲
At 0800 hours, prisoner Murphy,

684
01:09:42,010 --> 01:09:44,850
因为粗心
through carelessness on his part,

685
01:09:44,930 --> 01:09:47,760
在第17通风孔死去
was found dead in vent shaft 1 7.

686
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:50,390
他似乎被吸入通风扇门
He seems to have been sucked into a ventilator fan.

687
01:09:53,860 --> 01:09:56,610
晚上九点
At about 21 00 hours,

688
01:09:56,690 --> 01:10:00,820
囚犯葛立出现 精神错乱
prisoner Golic reappeared in a deranged state.

689
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:03,200
囚犯伯格和雷恩失踪
Prisoners Boggs and Rains are missing.

690
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:07,950
很可能是遇害...
There seems to be a good chance that they have met with foul play...

691
01:10:08,040 --> 01:10:11,290
遭囚犯葛立杀害
at the hands of prisoner Golic.

692
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:16,080
我们必须组组一支搜索队
We need to organize and send out a search party.

693
01:10:17,120 --> 01:10:20,800
有人自愿我们会很感激
Volunteers will be appreciated.

694
01:10:23,380 --> 01:10:27,550
这座监狱一直相安无事...
I think it's fair to say that our smoothly running facility...

695
01:10:27,640 --> 01:10:30,470
突然出现一些问题
has suddenly developed a few problems.

696
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:36,440
希望大家 能在这几天提起精神...
I can only hope we are able to all pull together over the next few days...

697
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:39,730
直到救援小组 接走蕾普丽中尉
until the rescue team arrives for Lieutenant Ripley.

698
01:10:39,820 --> 01:10:41,780
它来了 它杀死克里蒙斯!
lt's here! It got Clemens!

699
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:45,570
- 马上停止这种谣言 - 我跟你说它来了!
- Stop this raving at once! Stop it! - I'm telling you, it's here!

700
01:10:45,660 --> 01:10:48,580
亚伦 把那笨女人带回医疗室!
Aaron, get that foolish woman back to the infirmary!

701
01:10:51,870 --> 01:10:53,830
快跑!
Move it!

702
01:10:55,250 --> 01:10:56,500
让开!
Out of my way!

703
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:02,130
可恶!
Fuck!

704
01:11:08,890 --> 01:11:11,930
主呀 我们感谢你
We give you thanks, O Lord.

705
01:11:12,020 --> 01:11:17,020
您的愤怒已显现 我们知道审判快到
Your wrath has come, and the time is near for us to be judged.

706
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:22,070
世界末日将要降临
The apocalypse is upon us.

707
01:11:22,150 --> 01:11:27,780
让我们有所准备 得到您的饶恕
Let us be ready. Let your mercy be just.

708
01:11:27,870 --> 01:11:29,490
- 好可怕 - 阿门
- It was massive. - Amen!

709
01:11:29,620 --> 01:11:32,160
- 速度 - 我在那里 我看到了
- And fast. - l was there. I saw it.

710
01:11:32,240 --> 01:11:36,580
现在该怎么办? 谁来指挥?
What the fuck do we do now? Who's in fucking charge?

711
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:43,090
我们得组组起来 对吧?
Organize. We gotta organize, right?

712
01:11:43,170 --> 01:11:45,880
对 我有指挥权
Right. Well, I guess I'm next in line.

713
01:11:45,970 --> 01:11:49,550
- 让85指挥? 完了 - 别那么叫我
- 85's gonna be in charge. Jesus, give us a break! - Don't call me that.

714
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:52,010
我不可能取代安德鲁
Okay, look. There's no way I can replace Andrews.

715
01:11:52,100 --> 01:11:54,810
他是好人 虽然你们不喜欢他
He was a good man. I know you guys didn't appreciate him.

716
01:11:54,890 --> 01:11:58,060
亚伦 我们不想听屁话
Aaron, we don't want to hear that shit now.

717
01:11:58,150 --> 01:12:01,190
妹子 你呢? 你是个军官
Hey, sister, what about you? You're an officer.

718
01:12:01,270 --> 01:12:03,190
展露一点领导才能吧?
How about showing us a little leadership?

719
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:05,240
别管她 你来指挥
Forget fucking Shirley Temple. You take charge.

720
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:07,570
- 对 - 反正这里都是你在管
- Right. - You run things here anyway.

721
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:12,660
不可能 我没当官的材料
No fuckin' way. I'm not the officer type.

722
01:12:13,740 --> 01:12:15,910
我只会管我自己
I just take care of my own.

723
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:19,210
这臭怪物想要什么?
Well, what does this fucking beast want?

724
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:23,250
这老妈到底指不指挥?
Is this mother gonna try for us all?

725
01:12:26,630 --> 01:12:29,220
- 要 - 这下可好
- Yeah. - Well, ain't that sweet?

726
01:12:29,300 --> 01:12:32,100
你想怎么阻止它?
So how are we gonna stop it?

727
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:38,440
- 我们没有武器 对吧? - 对
- We have no weapons. Is that correct? - Right.

728
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:42,230
我看到的和这只不一样
I haven't seen one exactly like this before.

729
01:12:42,310 --> 01:12:44,770
它的动作有点不同
Moves differently.

730
01:12:46,860 --> 01:12:49,360
其他那些什么都不怕
But the others were afraid of fire-

731
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:51,450
只怕火
not much else.

732
01:12:52,740 --> 01:12:55,910
- 能不能封锁这地方? - 没办法
- Can we seal off this area? - No chance.

733
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,160
这个监狱10平方英里
The installation's 1 0 miles square.

734
01:12:58,290 --> 01:13:00,540
- 共有六百个通气管 - 录影设备呢?
- There's 600 air ducts running to the surface. - What about video?

735
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:04,340
这里到处都有闭路电视系统
I see these closed-circuit monitors everywhere. We could try to find it that way.

736
01:13:04,420 --> 01:13:08,550
闭路电视系统多年没用 这里什么都不能用
The video system hasn't worked in years. Nothing much works here.

737
01:13:08,630 --> 01:13:10,840
很多科技用品 都没办法修好
We got a lot of technology, no way to fix it.

738
01:13:10,930 --> 01:13:13,340
- 85想说的是... - 别那么叫我!
- What 85 is trying to tell you is- - Don't call me that!

739
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:16,510
没有娱乐中心 气候控制
we ain't got no entertainment center, no climate control,

740
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:19,180
没有视讯系统 没有监视
no video system, no surveillance,

741
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:22,770
没有电雪柜 没有雪糕
no freezers, no fucking ice cream,

742
01:13:22,860 --> 01:13:25,650
没有避孕套 没有女人 没有枪
no rubbers, no women, no guns.

743
01:13:25,730 --> 01:13:27,820
什么都没有!
All we got here is shit!

744
01:13:27,900 --> 01:13:30,610
跟她谈有个屁用?
Oh, what the hell are we even talking to her for?

745
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:34,120
她把那臭东西带来
She's the one that brought the fucker.

746
01:13:34,200 --> 01:13:38,080
何不砍下她的头 塞进墙壁?
Why don't we just get her head and shove it through the fucking wall?

747
01:13:38,160 --> 01:13:40,410
这样最好
That sounds good to me.

748
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,500
莫斯
Hey, Morse.

749
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:48,550
你他妈的闭嘴
Why don't you shut the fuck up?

750
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:56,510
好了
Right.

751
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:00,560
我们该怎么办?
Right. What are we going to do?

752
01:14:14,990 --> 01:14:17,450
这是什么?
What's this? Um,

753
01:14:17,540 --> 01:14:20,620
那条通道从饭堂通往医疗室
that leads from the mess hall to the infirmary.

754
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,710
是个通风孔
It's a ventilation shaft.

755
01:14:22,790 --> 01:14:26,130
我们从那里进去 把它逼出来
Then we go in there, flush it out.

756
01:14:26,210 --> 01:14:30,210
那里的隧道有好几里长
Hey. Hey, look, there's miles and miles of tunnel through there.

757
01:14:31,220 --> 01:14:33,220
它走不了太远
It won't go far.

758
01:14:34,260 --> 01:14:36,550
它会在这里筑巢
It'll nest in this area.

759
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:38,640
就在...
Right around...

760
01:14:39,640 --> 01:14:43,140
- 这附近 - 你怎么知道?
- Here. - How do you know that?

761
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,940
它就像只狮子
It's like a lion.

762
01:14:47,020 --> 01:14:49,230
紧跟着斑马群
It sticks close to the zebras.

763
01:14:49,320 --> 01:14:51,730
斑马? 这可好
Zebras? Oh, right.

764
01:14:51,820 --> 01:14:54,490
这么暗跑来跑去? 别开玩笑
But, look. Running around down here in the dark- Are you kidding?

765
01:14:54,570 --> 01:14:56,950
走出主通风孔就没有电灯
Once you get out of this main shaft, there's no overheads.

766
01:14:57,070 --> 01:15:00,200
- 不是有手电筒吗? - 有几千个 但没有电池
- Don't we have flashlights? - We got thousands of 'em, but no batteries.

767
01:15:00,330 --> 01:15:03,120
- 我说了 都废弃了 - 火把呢?
- I told you, nothing works. - Torches?

768
01:15:03,210 --> 01:15:06,210
我们能生火吧?
Do we have the capacity to make fire?

769
01:15:06,290 --> 01:15:09,590
人类从石器时代起 就有这能力
Most humans have enjoyed that privilege since the Stone Age.

770
01:15:10,670 --> 01:15:12,920
你用不着讽刺我
No need to be sarcastic.

771
01:15:14,680 --> 01:15:18,600
这里没用过 这里打算放核废料
Never been used. They were gonna dump a lot of nuclear crap in there.

772
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:21,810
一直没空 里头空无一物
Never got around to it. It's clean as a whistle inside.

773
01:15:21,890 --> 01:15:24,350
这里是出入的唯一通道?
This the only way in or out?

774
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:28,190
没错 墙壁有6尺多厚 实心钢造的
That's right. Walls are six feet thick, solid steel.

775
01:15:28,270 --> 01:15:30,690
建造起来真是大工程
Really knew how to build these babies.

776
01:15:30,770 --> 01:15:33,690
任何东西被关进去
You're saying we get something in there,

777
01:15:33,780 --> 01:15:35,940
绝对出不来?
there's no way it can get out?

778
01:15:36,020 --> 01:15:39,570
对 无路可逃
That's right. No fucking way.

779
01:15:46,540 --> 01:15:48,920
我们放在这里 忘了叫什么
This is where we keep it. I forget what the stuff's called.

780
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,500
- 圭乃特利西特林 - 我知道
- Quinitricetyline. - l knew that.

781
01:15:52,590 --> 01:15:55,840
我把工作分配好 让迪伦...
Right. I've got to get these section arrangements organized with Dillon...

782
01:15:55,930 --> 01:15:58,550
漆油
for the paintbrush, uh-

783
01:15:58,640 --> 01:16:01,010
- 现在... - 大卫
- So, um - David.

784
01:16:01,140 --> 01:16:05,180
- 你把这些油桶整理好 - 知道了 85
- Yeah. You can get these drums organized. - Right, 85.

785
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:08,650
还有...别那么叫我
And, uh, don't call me that.

786
01:16:11,150 --> 01:16:15,070
85到底是什么意思?
What's this "85" thing?

787
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:18,450
我们偷看过他的档案
Couple of us sneaked a look at his personnel file the day he arrived.

788
01:16:18,530 --> 01:16:20,530
那是他的智商
lt's his I.Q.

789
01:16:27,670 --> 01:16:29,790
我看过这种油桶...
I saw a drum of this stuff...

790
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:32,040
掉在海滩木屋
fall into a beachhead bunker once.

791
01:16:32,130 --> 01:16:35,590
爆炸令码头三个半月 没有鱼群
The blast put a tug in dry dock for 1 7 weeks.

792
01:16:35,670 --> 01:16:36,760
厉害的玩意!
Great stuff!

793
01:16:42,070 --> 01:16:45,110
让我搞清楚
All right. Let me get this straight.

794
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:48,620
你想用火把它烧出通风管
You want to burn it down and out of the pipes,

795
01:16:48,700 --> 01:16:50,870
逼进这里 把门锁上...
force it in here, slam the door...

796
01:16:50,960 --> 01:16:53,580
- 然后把它困住? - 对
- and trap its ass? - Right.

797
01:16:53,670 --> 01:16:57,500
你要我们 这些天生罪犯帮忙?
And you want help from us y-chromo boys, huh?

798
01:16:57,740 --> 01:16:59,610
你有别的事要做吗?
You got something better to do?

799
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:02,490
我们为何要替你 冒险拼命?
Why should we put our ass on the line for you?

800
01:17:02,570 --> 01:17:04,740
你们早就有危险
Your ass is already on the line.

801
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:06,450
问题是...
The only question is...

802
01:17:06,540 --> 01:17:08,960
你打算怎么办?
what are you gonna do about it?

803
01:17:21,760 --> 01:17:23,760
你看
Look at this.

804
01:17:23,850 --> 01:17:26,310
两千个电池 只有一个用得着
There's only one of these fucking batteries in 2,000 that works.

805
01:17:26,430 --> 01:17:28,640
还未算最糟
Hey, it could have been a lot worse. Yeah?

806
01:17:28,730 --> 01:17:32,370
可能照不亮
We might have got the paintbrush detail.

807
01:17:36,940 --> 01:17:39,030
这玩意真臭
Man, this stuff stinks.

808
01:17:52,620 --> 01:17:56,500
- 真的要臭死人了 - 那就别呼吸
- This shit smells awful. - Then don't breathe the fucking fumes.

809
01:17:56,590 --> 01:17:59,550
- 应该要戴氧气筒 - 你要我闷死!
- I'm in a fucking pipe with it. - How can I keep from breathing it!

810
01:17:59,630 --> 01:18:02,880
不要深呼吸
I mean, don't breathe too hard.

811
01:18:03,010 --> 01:18:06,430
- 你会很兴奋 - 感情好
- You'll get high. - That's good for me.

812
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:17,190
你想念医生 对吧?
So you miss Doc, right?

813
01:18:19,900 --> 01:18:22,400
你怎么这么说?
What makes you say that?

814
01:18:22,490 --> 01:18:24,820
你们两个很亲密
I thought you two got real close.

815
01:18:27,450 --> 01:18:30,330
我猜你很爱偷窥
I guess you've been looking through some keyholes.

816
01:18:30,450 --> 01:18:33,480
我是那么想的!
That's what I thought. Oh!

817
01:18:39,590 --> 01:18:43,300
- 你还好吗? - 还好
- You okay? - Yeah. l'm fine.

818
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:47,970
真的吗? 可是你看起来不太好
Whatever you say, but, uh, you don't look okay to me, sister.

819
01:18:49,640 --> 01:18:51,640
我很好
l'm fine.

820
01:18:55,190 --> 01:18:57,650
我讨厌这地方
I hate this place. I hate this place.

821
01:19:01,150 --> 01:19:03,110
嗯
Well.

822
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,820
除了我们 绝对还有别的东西
There's definitely something in here with us.

823
01:19:08,120 --> 01:19:10,910
我没打信号别点火
Okay. Don't light the fire until I give the signal.

824
01:19:10,990 --> 01:19:13,580
这是信号
This is the signal.

825
01:19:13,660 --> 01:19:17,000
懂吗? 记得住吗?
Got it? Can you remember that?

826
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,170
糟糕!
Shit!

827
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,230
巴哈
Buh-

828
01:20:23,780 --> 01:20:26,030
怎么不等信号?
Wait for the fucking signal!

829
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,290
趴下!
Get down!

830
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,460
快点 我们得找出洒水器
Come on, come on! We gotta find the sprinklers!

831
01:20:43,550 --> 01:20:45,710
快救他们!
Come on! We gotta help these guys!

832
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:56,270
快点 跑呀!
Come on! Move! Move!

833
01:20:57,890 --> 01:21:00,480
到废料处理场 别开门!
Go to the waste dump. Don't open the doors!

834
01:22:03,330 --> 01:22:05,210
- 天啊! - 不会有事的
- Oh, God! - It's all right.

835
01:22:05,290 --> 01:22:08,670
你会没事的 我们一定会救你
It's all right. You're gonna be all right. We got you.

836
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,840
火熄了
Fire's out.

837
01:22:22,560 --> 01:22:25,310
朱德 去把洒水器打开
Junior! Junior! Get those sprinklers and turn them on.

838
01:22:26,230 --> 01:22:28,860
快带他出去
We gotta get him out of here.

839
01:22:35,120 --> 01:22:37,870
我们带你出去
Come on. We're walking you out.

840
01:22:45,080 --> 01:22:48,380
它在你后面!
Junior! Behind you!

841
01:22:50,550 --> 01:22:52,170
开门!
Open the door!

842
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:55,550

Come on! Come on!

843
01:23:03,190 --> 01:23:06,060

844
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:07,690
来捉我呀 混蛋!
Come and get me, fucker!

845
01:24:41,490 --> 01:24:44,660
虽然他们受难
Even for those who have fallen,

846
01:24:44,740 --> 01:24:48,580
我们仍应欣慰
this is a time of rejoicing.

847
01:24:49,920 --> 01:24:54,210
向他们的勇气致敬
We salute their courage.

848
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:57,970
他们会永垂不朽
They will live forever.

849
01:25:01,390 --> 01:25:04,890
死亡并不代表真正死去
Those that are dead are not dead.

850
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:07,770
他们升上天去
They have moved up.

851
01:25:07,850 --> 01:25:11,520
到了更高的境界
They have moved to a higher place.

852
01:25:11,610 --> 01:25:14,320
疯子
Crazy bastards.

853
01:25:14,400 --> 01:25:18,240
克里蒙斯常叫做迪伦圣兵 令他们幸免于难
Andrews used to call them Dillon's God Squad. Keeps 'em out of mischief.

854
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:22,780
- 你不信宗教? - 我?
- You're not the religious type. - Me?

855
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:25,530
才不 我要工作
Shit, no. I've got a job.

856
01:25:26,870 --> 01:25:29,160
听着
Look, uh-

857
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:32,210
我想救援队四五天就会到了
Figure the rescue team gets here in four, five days-

858
01:25:32,290 --> 01:25:34,420
顶多是六天
six, tops.

859
01:25:34,500 --> 01:25:39,510
他们一来 拿出机关枪 轰死它
They open the door, go in there with smart guns and kill it.

860
01:25:42,050 --> 01:25:45,890
- 有消息吗? - 没有
- What have you heard from them? - Nothing much.

861
01:25:45,970 --> 01:25:48,470
只说收到讯息
We got a message received.

862
01:25:48,560 --> 01:25:51,520
后来又说 你是最高优先考虑
Later, we got something that said you were top priority.

863
01:25:53,360 --> 01:25:55,520
什么也不说
They don't cut us in on much.

864
01:25:55,610 --> 01:25:58,820
因为我们在边疆
We're the ass end of the totem pole out here.

865
01:25:58,900 --> 01:26:01,110
要是他们不想杀怪物呢?
What if they don't want to kill it?

866
01:26:03,240 --> 01:26:06,370
- 带回去吗? - 是的
- Take it back? - Yeah.

867
01:26:06,450 --> 01:26:10,700
他们疯了 一定要杀了它
They're not lunatics, you know? Gotta kill it.

868
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,920
对吗?
Right?

869
01:26:18,670 --> 01:26:22,720
莫斯 把我放开
Morse, please, cut me loose.

870
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:24,550
不可以
No fucking way.

871
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,300
很痛
Come on, man. It hurts.

872
01:26:26,430 --> 01:26:28,390
抱歉
Oh, sorry.

873
01:26:28,470 --> 01:26:31,640
我没做什么
Come on. I haven't done nothing.

874
01:26:31,770 --> 01:26:36,310
- 不要和我说话 - 拜托 我做了什么?
- Just don't talk to me. - Please, what did I do? Please.

875
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,940
告诉你我要怎么做 我要看管着你 那是我的事
I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna sit here and guard your ass like l'm supposed to.

876
01:26:41,030 --> 01:26:43,650
我不想惹怒迪伦
I don't need any fucking trouble with Dillon.

877
01:26:43,740 --> 01:26:47,570
我只告诉他 那条龙杀了伯格和雷恩
All I did was tell 'em about the dragon, what it did to Boggs and Rains.

878
01:26:47,660 --> 01:26:51,290
我没说谎 你看到了
I didn't lie. You saw it.

879
01:26:51,370 --> 01:26:53,250
可恶 我看到了
Fuckin' "A" I saw it.

880
01:26:53,330 --> 01:26:55,750
拜托
Oh, please.

881
01:26:55,830 --> 01:26:58,840
它一进来 我就死了 我跑不了
If this gets in here, I'm dead. I can't run.

882
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:00,960
它不会来的 它会被困住
It's not going to get in here. We got it trapped.

883
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,760
那也不会怎样 快点 放开我
So what's the big deal? Come on. Let me loose, man.

884
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:14,350
- 我每次都先给你烟 - 是的
- Don't I always give you cigarettes first? - Yeah.

885
01:27:14,480 --> 01:27:17,440
我不是你朋友吗?
Aren't I your friend?

886
01:27:17,520 --> 01:27:22,480
我爱你 莫斯
I love you, Morse.

887
01:27:23,650 --> 01:27:26,070
有何不可?
Why not?

888
01:27:30,990 --> 01:27:33,500
乖一点 不准惹事...
But behave yourself. No fucking around...

889
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:36,040
别害我
or I'll get nothing but shit.

890
01:27:44,260 --> 01:27:47,680
- 怪物在哪里? - 在废置炉
- So where they got it? - In the waste tank.

891
01:27:47,800 --> 01:27:52,470
把它困住
We got that sucker nailed. I mean, tight.

892
01:27:52,560 --> 01:27:55,100
我想再看看怪物
Gotta see it again.

893
01:27:55,190 --> 01:27:57,060
你说什么鬼话?
What the fuck you talking about?

894
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:02,940
不给你香烟了
No more cigarettes for you.

895
01:28:10,620 --> 01:28:14,750
第一步完成了 要说什么?
Right. We got the first part. Now what do we say?

896
01:28:14,870 --> 01:28:18,210
告诉他们是我们捉的
Tell them we trapped it.

897
01:28:18,330 --> 01:28:22,460
- 那叫什么? - 异形怪物
- What do we call it? - A xenomorph.

898
01:28:22,550 --> 01:28:24,550
对
Right.

899
01:28:25,550 --> 01:28:28,630
怎么拼音?
How do you spell it?

900
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:40,900
捉到异形怪物

901
01:28:42,440 --> 01:28:45,470
请批准消灭

902
01:28:45,780 --> 01:28:47,400
杀不了的
Hey, wait a minute. We can't kill it.

903
01:28:47,530 --> 01:28:49,200
- 又没有武器 - 对
- We don't have any weapons, right? - Right.

904
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:53,070
致费欧娜161C级监狱 通讯卫星通报：收到报告

905
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:56,910
看吧 就是这样 当我们狗屁
See? That's all they ever tell us. Treat us like shit.

906
01:28:57,060 --> 01:28:58,220
救援队将在12时抵达

907
01:28:58,290 --> 01:28:59,780
不允许消灭异形怪物

908
01:28:59,990 --> 01:29:01,430
救援队到达前避免接触

909
01:29:04,730 --> 01:29:06,620
要求不批准

910
01:29:23,690 --> 01:29:26,730
- 时好时坏 - 你在说什么?
- Off and on me now? - What the hell you talking about?

911
01:29:26,820 --> 01:29:29,400
说话呀
Talk to me, the beast.

912
01:29:29,490 --> 01:29:34,870
不可以进去 那怪物会吃掉你的
You can't go in there, dickhead. The big mothersucker will eat you alive.

913
01:29:44,250 --> 01:29:46,840
抱歉
Sorry.

914
01:29:46,920 --> 01:29:49,970
抱歉 抱歉 抱歉

告诉我要怎么做
Tell me what to do next.

916
01:30:46,360 --> 01:30:49,150
他们要来带走怪物
So, you're telling me they're coming to take this thing away?

917
01:30:49,230 --> 01:30:52,530
他们会这么做 根本就不杀死
Yeah, they're gonna try. They don't wanna kill it.

918
01:30:52,610 --> 01:30:55,110
我们得想办法
We gotta figure out a way to do it before they come here.

919
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:59,240
为什么我们要杀它? 反正公司会来解决
Why do we have to kill it? You just said the company's coming for it.

920
01:30:59,330 --> 01:31:02,370
对 他们是来带走怪物
That's right. They wanna take it back.

921
01:31:02,460 --> 01:31:05,250
- 用作研究武器 - 有何不可?
- Some sort of weapon. - Yeah, what's wrong with that?

922
01:31:05,330 --> 01:31:07,670
他们控制不了 他们不知道它的危险性
They can't control it. They don't understand. It'll kill them all.

923
01:31:09,000 --> 01:31:10,840
我说了 有何不可?
Like I said, what's wrong with that?

924
01:31:10,920 --> 01:31:15,260
没有... 但很多无辜的人会死
Nothing's wrong with that... except a lot of innocent people will die.

925
01:31:19,010 --> 01:31:22,020
我以为你有宗教信仰
I thought you were a religious man.

926
01:31:22,100 --> 01:31:24,730
你不明白
You don't understand, do you?

927
01:31:26,600 --> 01:31:30,770
外面的世界 对我们已经不存在
That world out there doesn't exist for us anymore.

928
01:31:31,900 --> 01:31:34,650
我们有自己的世界
We've got our own little world out here.

929
01:31:34,740 --> 01:31:38,410
虽然不大 却是我们的
It ain't much, but it's ours.

930
01:31:38,490 --> 01:31:42,290
别人都可以死吗?
So fuck everybody else.

931
01:31:42,370 --> 01:31:46,080
不 所有人都可以
No. Fuck them.

932
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:50,670
- 迪伦 - 是
- Hey, Dillon? - Yeah?

933
01:31:52,920 --> 01:31:57,760
迪伦 有个小问题
Uh, Dillon, we got a teeny-weeny problem.

934
01:32:13,280 --> 01:32:16,490
这下好了!
Fucking great!

935
01:32:16,570 --> 01:32:20,200
那疯小子放走怪物
Miserable, crazy son of a bitch let him loose.

936
01:32:20,280 --> 01:32:21,950
自作自受
Got what he fucking deserved.

937
01:32:23,290 --> 01:32:26,200
现在怎么办?
Well, now what are we gonna do?

938
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:30,500
安德鲁是对的 应该把那小子锁住的
Andrews was right. Should've kept the shithead chained up.

939
01:32:32,590 --> 01:32:34,920
你还好吗?
You okay?

940
01:32:35,050 --> 01:32:38,220
去她的 那怪物还在外面 该怎么办?
Piss on her. The fucking thing's loose out there. What are we gonna do?

941
01:32:38,300 --> 01:32:40,930
我说过了
l just said that.

942
01:32:41,010 --> 01:32:45,060
你这小王八蛋让葛立逃跑!
And you're the dumb prick that let Golic out. You miserable little shit!

943
01:32:45,140 --> 01:32:46,850
好了 住嘴
Come on. Cut that shit out.

944
01:32:46,980 --> 01:32:51,190
叫那个小丑识相点!
Tell your fucking bozo to shape up!

945
01:32:51,270 --> 01:32:53,570
你觉得呢?
Wh-Wh-What do you think?

946
01:32:53,650 --> 01:32:55,820
到逃生艇
I think I have to get to the E.E.V.

947
01:32:55,900 --> 01:33:00,030
- 为什么? - 我们得用神经扫描器
- Why? What's up? - I just have to use the neuroscanner.

948
01:33:01,660 --> 01:33:03,780
- 你看来很憔悴 - 管她好不好
- You don't look so good. - Who gives a shit how she looks?

949
01:33:03,870 --> 01:33:07,580
- 现在怎么办? - 你想挨揍吗 笨蛋?
- What are we gonna do? - Want a smack in the mouth, you stupid wanker?

950
01:33:07,660 --> 01:33:09,580
闭上你的臭嘴 别让大家惊慌!
Shut the fuck up and stop causing panic!

951
01:33:09,670 --> 01:33:13,130
惊慌? 你笨得连惊慌也不会写 别和我谈惊慌
Panic- You're so fucking stupid, you couldn't spell it. Don't talk to me about panic.

952
01:33:13,250 --> 01:33:15,630
- 我们才要恐慌 我们完蛋了! - 到底是谁的错?
- We ought to panic! We're fucking screwed! - Whose fault is that?

953
01:33:15,710 --> 01:33:17,670
你们两个闭嘴!
All right. Now shut up, both of you!

954
01:33:19,760 --> 01:33:21,840
闭嘴!
Shut up!

955
01:33:38,150 --> 01:33:41,320
- 我们都没有办法了 - 不出奇
- Well, I'm out of ideas! - Oh, surprise me.

956
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:46,200
- 外面怎么样? - 好主意
- What about outside? - Great idea.

957
01:33:46,290 --> 01:33:48,620
两天后日出 现在零下40度
Sun don't come up for another two days. It's 40 below zero.

958
01:33:48,710 --> 01:33:51,330
救援队10小时后来临 真是妙啊
The rescue team's 1 0 hours away. So that makes a lot of sense!

959
01:33:51,420 --> 01:33:54,750
让那怪物把我们当午餐!
Wonderful. You just want us to stay here and let this thing have us for lunch!

960
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:58,460
叫所有仍生还的人集合
I want you to get everybody that's still left together.

961
01:33:58,550 --> 01:34:02,800
到大厅聚集
Get 'em into the assembly hall.

962
01:34:02,890 --> 01:34:05,050
好的
Okay.

963
01:34:08,220 --> 01:34:10,180
她上哪里去了?
Where'd she go?

964
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:40,840
需要帮忙吗?
Need any help?

965
01:34:40,920 --> 01:34:44,840
我不是故意吓你
I don't mean to scare you.

966
01:34:44,930 --> 01:34:46,960
你不应该一个人乱走
You shouldn't be wandering around alone.

967
01:34:47,050 --> 01:34:50,120
帮我个忙 替我按键盘
Do me a favor and run this keyboard, will you?

968
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:53,720
好的
Okay.

969
01:35:04,190 --> 01:35:06,400
- 我该怎么做? - 按B或C
- What do I do? - Hit "B" or "C."

970
01:35:06,480 --> 01:35:08,150
C是什么?
What's "C"?

971
01:35:08,280 --> 01:35:10,740
- 显示生命机能 - 就是那个
- "Display biofunctions." - That's it.

972
01:35:13,780 --> 01:35:16,450
行了 现在呢?
Okay, we're hot. Now what?

973
01:35:16,530 --> 01:35:19,120
让它转一圈
Let it run a cycle.

974
01:35:19,500 --> 01:35:21,330
很模糊
It's real fuzzy.

975
01:35:22,410 --> 01:35:24,500
按放大键
Hit "enhancement."

976
01:35:42,940 --> 01:35:44,850
继续看
Keep looking.

977
01:35:51,850 --> 01:35:54,440
我看不懂这玩意儿
I don't know how to read this stuff.

978
01:35:54,530 --> 01:35:58,030
如果出血就有暗色块
Hemorrhaging will show as a dark patch.

979
01:36:03,700 --> 01:36:06,290
在头骨根部...
Look for...

980
01:36:06,370 --> 01:36:09,210
找细微裂痕
hairline fractures through the base of the skull.

981
01:36:09,330 --> 01:36:11,460
小小的白线
Little white lines.

982
01:36:11,860 --> 01:36:13,310
异体组组

983
01:36:19,720 --> 01:36:21,640
怎么了?
What is it?

984
01:36:23,430 --> 01:36:25,220
你体内也有一只
I think you've got one inside of you.

985
01:36:27,270 --> 01:36:30,100
不可能
That's not possible.

986
01:36:32,860 --> 01:36:35,270
什么样子?
What does it look like?

987
01:36:36,650 --> 01:36:39,270
DNA资料扫描中 组组类型不明

988
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:43,820
- 太可怕了 - 我得看看它
- Horrible. - I have to see it.

989
01:36:46,370 --> 01:36:48,290
- 定格 - 你最好别看
- Freeze it. - You don't want to look at it.

990
01:36:48,370 --> 01:36:50,290
定格!
Freeze it!

991
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:17,940
我很难过!
l'm sorry.

992
01:37:22,590 --> 01:37:25,880
那怪物还在 它逃出来了
All right. The fucking thing is loose. It's out there.

993
01:37:25,970 --> 01:37:29,350
救援队带着武器 快到达了
A rescue team is on its way with guns and shit.

994
01:37:29,430 --> 01:37:31,930
现在危机四伏
Right now there isn't any place that's real safe.

995
01:37:33,350 --> 01:37:35,310
大家在这里集合
But we stay here, in the assembly hall.

996
01:37:35,390 --> 01:37:38,480
这里没有空调
This place never had any fucking air conditioning.

997
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:40,770
如果怪物来了 一定走大门
If it comes in, it's gotta be through one of these doors.

998
01:37:40,860 --> 01:37:43,740
要有人守门 怪物来了才知道
Now we post a guard to let us know if it's coming.

999
01:37:43,820 --> 01:37:49,070
现在先躲好 准备好迎接它...
In the meantime, you lay low, be ready and stay right...

1000
01:37:49,340 --> 01:37:51,670
万一你的大限来临
in case your time comes.

1001
01:37:52,560 --> 01:37:56,430
迪伦 少鬼话连篇
Don't you start bullshitting, Dillon.

1002
01:37:56,640 --> 01:37:58,640
我们都会被困死在这里的
We're gonna be trapped in here like rats.

1003
01:37:58,730 --> 01:38:02,480
有武器小刀的 拿出来用吧!
You got a weapon? You got a blade? Then you take it out and you fucking use it!

1004
01:38:02,570 --> 01:38:07,320
对 用小刀就能杀死怪物?
Oh, right. So you think we're gonna stab this mothersucker to death?

1005
01:38:07,400 --> 01:38:10,070
杀死个毛
No, I don't think shit! Maybe.

1006
01:38:10,160 --> 01:38:13,080
只能在被杀死前令它受伤?
Maybe you'll hurt it before it takes you out, huh?

1007
01:38:13,160 --> 01:38:16,540
那是个主意 谁有更好的主意?
Isn't that something? Any of you got any better ideas?

1008
01:38:21,920 --> 01:38:26,340
告诉你们 等救援队到达前我们已经死光!
And I'll tell you, until the rescue team gets here, we're fucked!

1009
01:38:28,010 --> 01:38:31,010
大家先作准备吧
So you better get prepared.

1010
01:38:38,350 --> 01:38:40,810
我才不留在这里
Well, I ain't staying here.

1011
01:38:42,560 --> 01:38:45,190
随便你
Well, then, suit yourself.

1012
01:38:51,530 --> 01:38:53,370
点火
Fire.

1013
01:38:57,830 --> 01:39:02,670
- 是熔炉 - 对 我们把它弄到熔炉里
- Furnace. - Yeah. Let's make it to the furnace.

1014
01:39:04,840 --> 01:39:07,840
老天哪
Holy shit.

1015
01:39:09,170 --> 01:39:11,760
这下好了
Well, all right.

1016
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:13,930
真他妈的
Fuckin' "A."

1017
01:39:14,010 --> 01:39:17,350
- 真他妈的 - 说得对
- Fuckin' "A." - Too fuckin' right it's right.

1018
01:39:35,410 --> 01:39:38,990
设定好了 你想说什么?
It's up. What do you want to say?

1019
01:39:40,580 --> 01:39:42,410
跟他们说这里充满毒气
Tell them the whole place has gone toxic.

1020
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:45,210
别开玩笑
Are you kidding?

1021
01:39:45,290 --> 01:39:47,750
救援小组会折返
Then they won't come here. The rescue team will turn back.

1022
01:39:47,880 --> 01:39:50,420
- 我知道 - 你在胡说什么?
- Yeah. I know. - What are you talking about?

1023
01:39:50,510 --> 01:39:54,340
我们得靠他们杀死怪物
Our only hope is that they kill this fucker.

1024
01:39:54,430 --> 01:39:57,680
他们也许能想办法 把你冷藏起来
And maybe they can do something for you. I don't know, freeze you-

1025
01:39:57,760 --> 01:40:00,100
动手术 他们有技术
They can do an operation. They've got the technology.

1026
01:40:00,180 --> 01:40:03,980
要是异形逃走 就会杀光所有人
If this organism gets off the planet, it'll kill everything.

1027
01:40:04,060 --> 01:40:06,350
公司根本不在乎
The company doesn't care about that.

1028
01:40:06,440 --> 01:40:09,400
他们只想拿它 来研究生化武器
They just want it for their bioweapons division, okay?

1029
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:13,200
我们不能让他们来
So we can't let them come here.

1030
01:40:13,280 --> 01:40:15,360
管你的
Fuck you.

1031
01:40:15,450 --> 01:40:19,200
我很遗憾你体内有那东西 可是他们得救我
Look, I'm sorry you've got this thing inside you, but l'm getting rescued.

1032
01:40:19,290 --> 01:40:22,700
我才不管那些囚犯 我有老婆 孩子
I don't give a shit about these stupid prisoners, but l've got a wife, a kid.

1033
01:40:22,790 --> 01:40:25,790
- 下次轮到我回家 - 我知道
- I'll go home on the next rotation! - I know. This is hard.

1034
01:40:25,880 --> 01:40:29,540
不过我要传送这讯息 我要密码
I'm gonna send this message. I need that fucking code.

1035
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:32,630
抱歉 这是机密
I'm sorry, babe. It's classified.

1036
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:35,510
你这笨蛋一定要这么做
Listen, you stupid little shit! This has got to be done, okay?

1037
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:38,050
- 别无选择! - 没门
- There are no alternatives! - No way!

1038
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:41,220
我不会给你密码 不可能
You're not getting it! No fucking way!

1039
01:40:47,730 --> 01:40:50,500
听着 我跟你无冤无仇
Look, it's nothing personal.

1040
01:40:50,680 --> 01:40:52,480
明白吗?
Understand?

1041
01:40:52,570 --> 01:40:54,650
我认为你会没有事
I think you're okay.

1042
01:40:59,990 --> 01:41:01,490
谢了
Thanks.

1043
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:13,380
你有什么主意吗?
Have you got any ideas?

1044
01:41:13,460 --> 01:41:18,090
它不会杀我
It won't kill me.

1045
01:41:18,180 --> 01:41:20,600
我孕育新女王
I'm carrying the new queen.

1046
01:41:20,680 --> 01:41:23,850
它不会杀死自己的未来
It won't kill its future.

1047
01:41:23,980 --> 01:41:28,770
那怪物有这么聪明?
You really wanna bet this thing's that smart?

1048
01:41:28,850 --> 01:41:33,360
或许我去找它 看它到底有多聪明
Maybe I'll go find it. See how smart it is.

1049
01:41:33,480 --> 01:41:36,780
- 你要去找它? - 对
- You're gonna go and look for it? - Yeah.

1050
01:41:36,860 --> 01:41:40,450
我知道它在哪里
I have a pretty good idea of where it is.

1051
01:41:40,530 --> 01:41:45,500
它就在下面 地下室
It's just down there... in the basement.

1052
01:41:45,620 --> 01:41:49,170
这整个地方都是地下室
This whole place is a basement.

1053
01:41:49,250 --> 01:41:54,320
我只是打个比喻 你来不来?
It's a metaphor. Wanna come?

1054
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:00,450
我日
Fuck me.

1055
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:05,770
收到逃生艇扫描资料

1056
01:42:19,500 --> 01:42:22,160
紧急医疗小组 将在2小时内到达

1057
01:42:22,700 --> 01:42:25,030
最高优先考虑： 隔离蕾普丽中尉

1058
01:42:28,940 --> 01:42:31,360
等待确认

1059
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:24,300
要找你时你在哪里呢?
Where are you when I need you?

1060
01:43:57,000 --> 01:43:59,250
别怕
Don't be afraid.

1061
01:44:01,470 --> 01:44:03,470
我是你的家人
l'm part of the family.

1062
01:45:10,490 --> 01:45:13,540
你进入我的生命这么久
You've been in my life so long,

1063
01:45:13,620 --> 01:45:16,160
我已经不记得其他事情
I can't remember anything else.

1064
01:45:18,420 --> 01:45:20,540
现在帮我个忙吧
Now do something for me.

1065
01:45:22,380 --> 01:45:24,340
很简单
It's easy.

1066
01:45:24,420 --> 01:45:27,220
只要...
Just-

1067
01:45:27,300 --> 01:45:30,140
只要发挥你的本能
Just do what you do.

1068
01:46:14,390 --> 01:46:18,270
- 它不肯杀我 - 你应该躲起来
- It won't kill me. - What are you doing out here? You're supposed to be laying low.

1069
01:46:18,350 --> 01:46:21,940
我体内也有一只
I have one inside of me.

1070
01:46:22,020 --> 01:46:23,650
大只的怪物不肯杀我
Big one won't kill its own.

1071
01:46:23,770 --> 01:46:26,900
- 你在说什么? - 我刚刚看到了
- What are you talking about? - I just saw it,

1072
01:46:26,990 --> 01:46:29,650
一小时前
an hour ago.

1073
01:46:29,740 --> 01:46:32,120
我就站在它旁边
I stood right next to it.

1074
01:46:32,200 --> 01:46:36,200
它可以杀我 可是它不杀我
I could've been lunch, but it wouldn't touch me.

1075
01:46:36,290 --> 01:46:38,830
它跑掉了
It ran away.

1076
01:46:39,960 --> 01:46:42,210
它知道我在孕育它的后代
It knows I'm carrying its future.

1077
01:46:42,290 --> 01:46:45,460
胡说 你怎么知道你体内也有?
Aw, bullshit. How do you know that thing's inside you?

1078
01:46:45,550 --> 01:46:49,130
我透过断层扫描看到它
I saw it... on the CAT scan.

1079
01:46:49,220 --> 01:46:54,300
它是个女王 会产卵
It's a queen- an egg layer.

1080
01:46:54,390 --> 01:46:56,390
它会生出上千个这种怪物
It can make thousands more like the one we've got here.

1081
01:46:56,470 --> 01:47:00,180
听起来还是胡说八道
Still sounds like bullshit to me.

1082
01:47:00,270 --> 01:47:03,750
那东西是怎么进入你体内?
If that thing's inside you, how'd it get there?

1083
01:47:04,430 --> 01:47:07,440
不知道
I don't know.

1084
01:47:07,530 --> 01:47:09,940
我在长眠的时候吧
When I was in hypersleep, I guess.

1085
01:47:10,030 --> 01:47:12,240
它攻击我
l was violated.

1086
01:47:13,990 --> 01:47:16,660
现在我成为女王之母
Now I get to be the mother.

1087
01:47:20,120 --> 01:47:23,790
我的时间不多
I don't have much time,

1088
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:27,210
无法做我该做的事
and I can't do what I should.

1089
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:31,670
我要你帮忙
I need you to help me.

1090
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:38,260
你得杀死我
I need you to kill me.

1091
01:47:38,350 --> 01:47:41,980
- 你在胡说什么? - 反正我死定了
- What the fuck are you talking about? - I'm dead anyway.

1092
01:47:42,060 --> 01:47:45,650
我活不了
I can't survive it.

1093
01:47:45,730 --> 01:47:48,730
我体内的异形 会繁殖上千只后代
But the one inside of me can generate thousands more,

1094
01:47:50,490 --> 01:47:53,280
可以杀光整个宇宙
can wipe out the whole universe.

1095
01:47:53,360 --> 01:47:55,870
它一定得死
lt has to die.

1096
01:47:55,950 --> 01:47:58,410
必须有人杀死我
So somebody's gotta kill me.

1097
01:48:01,000 --> 01:48:03,040
你办得到吗?
Are you up to it?

1098
01:48:04,080 --> 01:48:07,090
这点你不必担心
You don't have to worry about that.

1099
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:26,650
不必致词
No speeches.

1100
01:48:29,860 --> 01:48:32,110
也不必祷告
No prayers.

1101
01:49:03,480 --> 01:49:06,560
- 怎么回事? - 我不喜欢服输
- What's going on? - I don't like losing a fight.

1102
01:49:06,650 --> 01:49:08,850
对任何人或物都一样
Not to nobody, not to nothing.

1103
01:49:08,980 --> 01:49:13,440
那东西杀死半数的弟兄
Fuck. That damn thing out there has already killed half my men,

1104
01:49:13,530 --> 01:49:15,360
另一半也被吓得半死
got the other half scared shitless.

1105
01:49:15,450 --> 01:49:18,530
只要它还活着 你就别想拯救宇宙
As long as it's alive, sister, you're not gonna save any universe.

1106
01:49:18,620 --> 01:49:20,240
我叫你杀了我
You said you were gonna kill me.

1107
01:49:20,330 --> 01:49:24,000
- 你是胆小鬼 - 我要捉住它
- You fucking coward! - I want that thing!

1108
01:49:24,280 --> 01:49:27,780
我要你帮我逮住它
I want to get this thing, and I need you to do it.

1109
01:49:27,870 --> 01:49:32,040
它不肯杀你 也许对我们有利
And if it won't kill you, then maybe that helps us fight it.

1110
01:49:32,160 --> 01:49:36,040
不然就少说废话!
Otherwise, fuck you!

1111
01:49:36,170 --> 01:49:39,170
你不帮忙就去死
Go kill yourself.

1112
01:49:43,170 --> 01:49:45,550
迪伦
Dillon.

1113
01:49:46,930 --> 01:49:48,760
干掉这怪物之后
We waste this thing,

1114
01:49:50,600 --> 01:49:53,120
- 你就得除掉我 - 没问题
- then you take care of me. - No problem.

1115
01:49:54,060 --> 01:49:57,730
你会死得痛快 不受折磨
Quick, easy and painless.

1116
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,650
由你自己决定
This is the choice.

1117
01:50:04,740 --> 01:50:08,660
你们想坐以待毙 还是奋战到死
You die sitting here on your ass, or you die out there.

1118
01:50:08,740 --> 01:50:12,330
至少我们该试试 让它好看
At least we take a shot. We owe it one.

1119
01:50:12,410 --> 01:50:16,830
它把我们都害惨了 应该来个以牙还牙
It's fucked us up. Maybe we can get even for the others.

1120
01:50:18,130 --> 01:50:20,840
- 要怎么做? - 你在胡说什么?
- Now how do you want it? - What the fuck are you talking about?

1121
01:50:20,920 --> 01:50:23,550
我是说去杀了那混帐东西
I'm talkin' about killing that big motherfucker.

1122
01:50:23,630 --> 01:50:26,880
等一下 救援队要来了
Hold it, hold it. The rescue team's on its way.

1123
01:50:26,970 --> 01:50:30,220
我们只要等就好了
We could just sit this out.

1124
01:50:30,300 --> 01:50:33,100
- 要救援谁呢? - 我们呀
- Rescue team for whom? - For us.

1125
01:50:34,980 --> 01:50:38,060
他们只想要怪物
They just want the beast. You know that.

1126
01:50:38,150 --> 01:50:39,810
我才不管他们要什么
I don't give a damn what they want.

1127
01:50:39,900 --> 01:50:42,060
他们不会逐个接走吧?
They're not gonna pick us off one by one, are they?

1128
01:50:42,500 --> 01:50:44,170
这我不敢说
I wouldn't be so sure.

1129
01:50:44,250 --> 01:50:46,500
他们是来带我们回家的
Come on. They're gonna take us home.

1130
01:50:46,590 --> 01:50:47,880
不是我们
They're not gonna take us home.

1131
01:50:47,960 --> 01:50:49,880
我们不必跟它拼命
Still doesn't mean we should go out and fight it.

1132
01:50:49,960 --> 01:50:54,010
- 天啊 饶了我们! - 你们都是笨蛋!
- Jesus Christ! Give us a break! - You guys have got to be fucking nuts!

1133
01:50:54,090 --> 01:50:56,720
- 我有老婆孩子 - 没有人睬你 85
- Look, I've got a wife and a kid. - Nobody gives a shit about you, 85.

1134
01:50:56,810 --> 01:50:59,310
你不是我们的一员 你没有信仰
You're not one of us. You're not a believer.

1135
01:50:59,390 --> 01:51:02,060
- 你只是个臭员工 - 好吧
- You're a fucking company man! - Yeah, okay.

1136
01:51:02,140 --> 01:51:04,640
我是员工 不是臭囚犯
Okay, I'm a company man and not a fucking criminal.

1137
01:51:04,810 --> 01:51:07,310
你一直骂我笨
You keep telling me how dumb I am.

1138
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:09,610
起码我够聪明 不像你们永远被关在这里!
Well, I'm smart enough not to have a life sentence on this rock!

1139
01:51:09,690 --> 01:51:11,480
- 去你的头 - 滚开 85!
- Fuck you! - Piss off, 85!

1140
01:51:11,610 --> 01:51:16,200
我够聪明 我会等武器来了再上战场!
Yeah, and I'm smart enough to wait for some firepower to show up before we fight this thing!

1141
01:51:16,280 --> 01:51:17,950
对吗 莫斯?
Right, Morse?

1142
01:51:18,030 --> 01:51:20,740
好吧 你就乖乖坐在这儿
Right. Okay. Just sit here on your asses. Fine.

1143
01:51:20,830 --> 01:51:23,620
我也要乖乖坐在这里儿
How about if I sit here on my ass?

1144
01:51:23,710 --> 01:51:27,170
没问题 我忘了
No problem. Oh, I forgot.

1145
01:51:27,250 --> 01:51:29,210
你向上帝祈求...
You're the guy that's made a deal with God...

1146
01:51:29,290 --> 01:51:31,920
获得永生
to live forever, huh?

1147
01:51:32,010 --> 01:51:36,300
其余的胆小鬼 也可以坐着不动
And all the rest of you pussies can sit it out too.

1148
01:51:36,380 --> 01:51:39,470
我和她会负责打仗
Me and her'll do all the fighting.

1149
01:51:39,550 --> 01:51:42,560
好吧 不过我要杀死它 
Okay. But I want the same thing as you.

1150
01:51:42,640 --> 01:51:45,680
我恨透那东西 它也杀死我的好朋友
I want to see it dead. I hate the fucker! It killed my mates too!

1151
01:51:45,770 --> 01:51:50,310
为何不等到公司 把枪运来再动手?
Why the fuck can't we wait for the company and have some guns on our side?

1152
01:51:50,400 --> 01:51:53,980
- 为何一定要白白送死? - 对
- Why do we have to go on some fucking suicide run? - Right.

1153
01:51:54,070 --> 01:51:55,650
因为公司不会杀死它
Because they won't kill it.

1154
01:51:55,740 --> 01:51:59,280
他们可能杀了你们灭口
They might kill you just for having seen it. But they're not gonna kill it.

1155
01:51:59,370 --> 01:52:03,660
太荒谬了 胡说八道 他们不会杀我们!
That is crazy! That is horseshit! They will not kill us!

1156
01:52:06,010 --> 01:52:09,060
当他们第一次听到有异形
When they first heard about this thing,

1157
01:52:09,140 --> 01:52:11,440
就说可以牺牲船员
it was "crew expendable."

1158
01:52:11,520 --> 01:52:16,230
上次派去的海军陆战队 也一样可以牺牲
The next time they sent in marines. They were expendable too.

1159
01:52:16,320 --> 01:52:20,150
难道他们会在乎...
What makes you think they're gonna care about a bunch of lifers...

1160
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:24,160
关在外太空的囚犯吗?
who found God at the ass end of space?

1161
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:26,580
难道他们会让你们...
You really think they're going to let you...

1162
01:52:26,660 --> 01:52:28,910
破坏他们的计划吗?
interfere with their plans for this thing?

1163
01:52:30,080 --> 01:52:32,670
他们认为我们是垃圾
They think we're- we're crud.

1164
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:36,090
根本就不在乎你们的...
And they don't give a fuck about one friend of yours...

1165
01:52:36,170 --> 01:52:38,380
死活
that's- that's died.

1166
01:52:38,460 --> 01:52:40,210
没有人在乎
Not one.

1167
01:52:44,300 --> 01:52:46,350
你有计划吗?
Have you got some sort of plan?

1168
01:52:46,430 --> 01:52:49,220
这是个铸铅厂 不是吗?
This is a lead works, isn't it?

1169
01:52:49,310 --> 01:52:53,350
只要把异形丢进模子
All we got to do is lure the fucking beast into the mold,

1170
01:52:53,440 --> 01:52:55,650
让它溺死在滚烫的铅里
drown it in hot lead.

1171
01:52:55,730 --> 01:52:58,860
好吧 我们该怎么做?
All right. So how do we do that?

1172
01:52:58,940 --> 01:53:02,240
没错 谁来当饵?
Yeah. What are we gonna use for bait?

1173
01:53:08,580 --> 01:53:13,370
- 该死 - 你们迟早都得死
- Oh, fuck! - We're all gonna die.

1174
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:16,380
问题是怎样死法
The only question is when.

1175
01:53:16,460 --> 01:53:20,090
这地方很适合...
This is as good a place as any...

1176
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:23,340
做上天堂的第一步
to take your first steps to heaven.

1177
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:26,260
问题只是要如何上去
Only question is how you check out.

1178
01:53:28,100 --> 01:53:31,060
你们要死得轰轰烈烈...
Do you want it on your feet...

1179
01:53:31,140 --> 01:53:34,940
还是跪地求饶呢?
or on your fucking knees, begging?

1180
01:53:35,020 --> 01:53:37,520
我不会求饶
I ain't much for begging.

1181
01:53:37,610 --> 01:53:40,440
也没有人饶过我
Nobody ever gave me nothin'.

1182
01:53:40,530 --> 01:53:43,820
我说干掉那怪物 跟他拼命
So I say fuck that thing! Let's fight it!

1183
01:53:49,280 --> 01:53:52,290
好吧 我们跟它拼了
Fuck it! Let's go for it!

1184
01:53:55,790 --> 01:53:59,540
- 搞死它 - 它冲过来怎么办?
- Let's kick its fucking ass. - What if it runs at us?

1185
01:53:59,630 --> 01:54:02,130
最好先想出好办法来
That's a fucking good idea.

1186
01:54:05,720 --> 01:54:09,720
一号门开启
Channel "A," Door 1 open.

1187
01:54:09,800 --> 01:54:12,060
你们几时用过这地方?
When was the last time you used this place?

1188
01:54:12,140 --> 01:54:14,390
五 六年前用过
We fired it up five, six years ago.

1189
01:54:14,480 --> 01:54:16,100
你确定活塞还能用?
You sure the piston's gonna work?

1190
01:54:16,190 --> 01:54:18,480
没有一样东西能确定
There's nothing for sure in this place.

1191
01:54:23,120 --> 01:54:26,540
它被困进去你就拉下把手 关起活塞
We trap it here first, then you pull the lever, start the piston.

1192
01:54:26,620 --> 01:54:29,120
把它推下模子 然后把铅倒进去
Then the piston's gonna push the mothersucker right into the mold.

1193
01:54:29,210 --> 01:54:32,920
很简单 它死定了
Then one of the guys will pour the lead. End of his ass. End of story.

1194
01:54:33,000 --> 01:54:35,800
- 要是有人搞砸呢? - 那就完蛋了 我们只有一次机会
- What if somebody screws it up? - We're fucked. You got one chance.

1195
01:54:35,880 --> 01:54:38,670
一击即中
One shot at it. That's all.

1196
01:54:38,760 --> 01:54:43,260
没时间重新再来 记住 当你拉下把手
We'll never have time to reset it. Now remember, when you pull the lever,

1197
01:54:43,350 --> 01:54:47,600
你也会和那怪物 困在里面一会儿
for a few seconds you're gonna be trapped in here with that fuckin' thing.

1198
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,930
你们不出差错 我也不会
If you guys don't drop the ball, I won't.

1199
01:54:50,020 --> 01:54:52,940
它最好真的不肯杀你
Well, you just better be right about that thing not wanting you.

1200
01:54:53,020 --> 01:54:55,980
它想逃出去只有一条路
Because if it wants out, that's how it's gonna go.

1201
01:54:56,070 --> 01:54:58,730
通过凹槽 通过你
Through that alcove, through you.

1202
01:54:58,860 --> 01:55:01,360
- 你在哪里? - 我在附近
- Where are you gonna be? - I'll be around.

1203
01:55:01,450 --> 01:55:05,120
- 其他人呢? - 在祷告
- What about the others? Where are they? - Praying.

1204
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:15,000
- 你相信有天堂吗? - 不知道
- You believe in this heaven shit? - Eh? I don't know.

1205
01:55:15,090 --> 01:55:17,420
我也是
Me neither.

1206
01:55:19,050 --> 01:55:23,930
可恶 还有什么能相信呢?
Fuck it, though. What else have we got to believe in?

1207
01:55:24,010 --> 01:55:27,180
那就是事实
Say that for fucking sure.

1208
01:55:29,220 --> 01:55:31,270
嘿
Well- Hey.

1209
01:55:33,020 --> 01:55:36,360
去它的 对不?
What the fuck, right?

1210
01:55:53,370 --> 01:55:56,750
我听不到...
Silence! I can't hear-

1211
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:04,260
动作要迅速
Let's launch this thing!

1212
01:56:13,270 --> 01:56:16,600
七号门关闭
Channel "B," Door 7.

1213
01:56:17,610 --> 01:56:20,940
情况不妙
I don't know about this shit.

1214
