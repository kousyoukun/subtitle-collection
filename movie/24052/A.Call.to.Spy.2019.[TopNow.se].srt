1
00:24:45,068 --> 00:24:46,444
Follow me.

2
00:26:22,791 --> 00:26:24,042
How is he feeling?

3
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,946
...cruel violence is spreading

4
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,741
throughout the German occupied Europe.

5
00:27:38,408 --> 00:27:44,581
The crime of Hitler... the crimes cannot be
tolerated by our beloved country.

6
00:29:13,086 --> 00:29:15,088
May I borrow your newspaper?

7
00:29:15,171 --> 00:29:16,673
I left mine on the bus.

8
00:31:12,247 --> 00:31:16,751
There are informants everywhere.
We just want to keep our families safe.

9
00:31:25,552 --> 00:31:27,637
What can we do?

10
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:43,445
Jean will meet you tonight
to print two thousand copies.

11
00:31:43,528 --> 00:31:44,904
I’ll take care of it.

12
00:31:45,447 --> 00:31:47,282
Distribute these amongst the workers.

13
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:33,780
May we speak?

14
00:43:33,863 --> 00:43:34,906
I’m not interested.

15
00:45:25,141 --> 00:45:25,975
Yes?

16
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,186
We identified an illegal radio signal
from your home.

17
00:45:28,853 --> 00:45:29,938
I don’t have a radio.

18
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,234
Please, come in.

19
00:45:35,276 --> 00:45:39,656
- I know he is here
- May I offer you something to eat?

20
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:02,293
Don’t believe this propaganda madam.

21
00:50:03,003 --> 00:50:06,131
The Germans are the enemy... not the Jews.

22
00:51:53,446 --> 00:51:54,864
I’m a new patient.

23
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:56,074
For Dr. Chevain?

24
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:58,284
No Dr. Benoit.

25
00:52:01,496 --> 00:52:03,206
Father Robert Alesch.

26
00:52:03,289 --> 00:52:05,000
Your sermons are legendary.

27
00:52:10,547 --> 00:52:12,507
We can’t stand by with our arms folded.

28
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:13,967
Indeed.

29
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:17,262
I’m looking for Brigitte?

30
00:52:18,888 --> 00:52:21,099
Do you have a message for her?

31
00:52:21,182 --> 00:52:22,976
I need to see her.

32
00:52:25,562 --> 00:52:27,313
I’m sorry, Father, but...

33
00:52:28,982 --> 00:52:30,316
I apologize for the inconvenience.

34
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:36,197
Perhaps you can return another time?

35
00:52:37,115 --> 00:52:39,784
I can’t promise,
but I’ve heard Brigitte might be in town.

36
00:52:40,076 --> 00:52:44,664
There is a double agent in Bordeaux.
All my contacts have been arrested.

37
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:46,416
Who knows if any of them have talked.

38
00:52:46,875 --> 00:52:51,421
I need protection,
a disguise and money to rebuild a network.

39
00:52:52,797 --> 00:52:54,299
I’ve heard about Brigitte.

40
00:52:54,591 --> 00:52:55,884
If you see her, please--

41
00:52:55,967 --> 00:52:57,927
I’ll pass along the message.

42
00:52:58,219 --> 00:52:59,346
It’s urgent.

43
00:52:59,721 --> 00:53:00,638
I understand.

44
01:00:38,972 --> 01:00:40,932
It look’s beautiful, doesn’t it?

45
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:43,953
Boarding
Train for Paris!

46
01:02:16,653 --> 01:02:19,114
Search everything.
Everybody off the train!

47
01:02:21,658 --> 01:02:23,326
Everybody off, bring your luggage!

48
01:02:54,232 --> 01:02:56,443
We found her!

49
01:03:07,871 --> 01:03:09,539
Everybody back on the train!

50
01:03:48,203 --> 01:03:50,663
I won’t be long.

51
01:04:16,898 --> 01:04:18,441
8, rue des Archers

52
01:05:37,520 --> 01:05:40,315
This will be helpful.

53
01:06:07,676 --> 01:06:09,552
In the center, right?

54
01:07:01,730 --> 01:07:03,231
We’ve finally caught you.

55
01:07:12,949 --> 01:07:14,284
You must go!

56
01:07:14,367 --> 01:07:16,369
It’s too dangerous here!

57
01:09:49,522 --> 01:09:52,567
What, a woman with a wooden leg?
She will slow us down.

58
01:09:53,026 --> 01:09:54,277
I’m telling you she cannot do it.

59
01:09:54,361 --> 01:09:55,570
It’s not going to work.

60
01:12:30,433 --> 01:12:31,851
Stop!

61
01:12:33,144 --> 01:12:34,646
It’s the police!

62
01:12:35,939 --> 01:12:37,524
I said stop!

63
01:15:22,439 --> 01:15:24,190
What do you have there?

64
01:15:43,918 --> 01:15:46,588
Good. Let’s play.

65
01:15:46,671 --> 01:15:48,840
It’s for the prisoner, sir.

66
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:52,052
They can have it when we’re done.
Put it down here.

67
01:16:39,724 --> 01:16:43,728
Let’s pack it up for tonight.
But I’ll be back tomorrow for a rematch.

68
01:16:55,407 --> 01:16:56,908
Bring her to the prisoners.

69
01:17:12,799 --> 01:17:14,259
To pass the time tonight.

70
01:17:14,342 --> 01:17:17,012
That’s nice of you.

71
01:17:19,931 --> 01:17:21,141
Lights out!

72
01:17:41,536 --> 01:17:42,662
Thank God!

73
01:17:44,372 --> 01:17:45,373
Let’s go.

74
01:18:03,725 --> 01:18:04,976
What is going on here?

75
01:18:06,186 --> 01:18:09,314
Is there a problem, sir?

76
01:18:12,859 --> 01:18:14,694
What are you all doing past curfew hour?

77
01:18:16,363 --> 01:18:17,864
We don’t want to cause trouble.

78
01:18:22,077 --> 01:18:25,580
Get on your knees, all of you. Now!

79
01:18:27,832 --> 01:18:28,833
Sir, there’s a misunderstanding.

80
01:18:33,588 --> 01:18:35,632
Your accent... it’s not from around here.

81
01:21:29,681 --> 01:21:31,683
I thought it was you!

82
01:21:31,766 --> 01:21:33,101
Oh my God! How are you?

83
01:21:36,021 --> 01:21:38,314
What are you doing here?

84
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:40,442
It’s complicated.

85
01:21:40,525 --> 01:21:42,235
You look like you could
really use a cup of tea.

86
01:21:42,318 --> 01:21:44,612
Yes, that would be lovely.

87
01:21:45,363 --> 01:21:47,532
I’m so happy to see you.

88
01:21:47,615 --> 01:21:49,951
You can’t even imagine.

89
01:21:57,375 --> 01:22:03,298
I’ve been sleeping in alleys for days.
I have nowhere to go.

90
01:22:05,216 --> 01:22:06,259
Can you help me?

91
01:22:07,510 --> 01:22:11,014
I have a family, Noor.
If anyone finds out...

92
01:22:11,097 --> 01:22:13,558
Giselle, thousands of Jews are disappearing.

93
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:17,562
Now innocent French children
are being marked with yellow stars.

94
01:22:18,730 --> 01:22:20,357
Aren’t you afraid?

95
01:22:23,151 --> 01:22:25,987
Please... for France?

96
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:31,076
A few days.

97
01:22:32,035 --> 01:22:33,536
That’s all I can offer you.

98
01:23:27,298 --> 01:23:31,636
<i>Roosevelt’s decision,
committing U.S. troops to aid the British</i>

99
01:23:31,720 --> 01:23:36,933
<i>in the seizure of French North Africa has
culminated in a major defeat to the Axis.</i>

100
01:23:37,017 --> 01:23:39,185
<i>Having lost control of the Mediterranean,</i>

101
01:23:39,477 --> 01:23:47,027
<i>Hitler’s forces are gathering on the frontiers of
Southern France to occupy the rest of France.</i>

102
01:24:36,993 --> 01:24:39,371
Klaus Barbie has arrived!

103
01:25:05,063 --> 01:25:08,525
I’d do anything to get my hands
on that limping bitch’s throat.

104
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:13,029
Distribute these fliers. All over France.

105
01:25:23,998 --> 01:25:26,167
Tone it down on those sermons.

106
01:25:26,668 --> 01:25:31,214
This is new for me.
I wanted to be convincing, Herr Barbie...

107
01:25:31,297 --> 01:25:32,924
Do not disparage the Führer’s name!

108
01:25:36,594 --> 01:25:43,226
...so no one suspects anything. My apologies.

109
01:25:52,027 --> 01:25:52,986
Your bonus.

110
01:25:57,073 --> 01:25:59,242
I paid for both of your whores in Paris, as well.

111
01:26:01,828 --> 01:26:03,455
Find me this woman.

112
01:27:30,417 --> 01:27:32,711
This is the punishment for anyone...

113
01:27:33,044 --> 01:27:35,714
who is caught aiding spies
and betraying the Führer.

114
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:47,410
Where is she?

115
01:28:48,119 --> 01:28:50,330
You are asking me questions
and I do not know the answers.

116
01:28:50,997 --> 01:28:53,124
Why would she have told me anything?

117
01:28:53,416 --> 01:28:54,501
I am a doctor.

118
01:28:54,876 --> 01:28:56,920
I am healing people, that’s it.

119
01:29:12,852 --> 01:29:13,853
Where is she?

120
01:29:14,437 --> 01:29:15,522
I don’t know.

121
01:30:08,908 --> 01:30:10,577
This is what we do with spies.

122
01:31:51,803 --> 01:31:52,846
What have you done?

123
01:31:52,929 --> 01:31:53,972
I did this for you.

124
01:31:54,514 --> 01:31:55,682
For you to eat.

125
01:32:45,815 --> 01:32:48,443
Move it you dirty whore! Keep moving.

126
01:34:54,569 --> 01:34:57,405
Loyalty. It’s overrated.

127
01:35:09,626 --> 01:35:12,253
Start transmitting as Madeline.

128
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:28,867
She’s heading South... Pyrenees.

129
01:39:41,773 --> 01:39:45,944
She’s tried to escape twice.
We can’t get anything out of her.

130
01:39:50,365 --> 01:39:52,158
Put her on the next van.

131
01:44:01,491 --> 01:44:02,575
You did it!
