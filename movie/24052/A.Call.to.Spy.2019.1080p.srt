1
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,620
法国落入纳粹统治 英国孤立无援

2
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:55,560
温斯顿・丘吉尔紧急创建了一个间谍机构来破坏纳粹的战争机器

3
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:02,180
间谍没有足够的经验去面对这种新型战争 只能交由外行来做 他们深入敌后 发动秘密战争

4
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:09,860
灵感来源于真实故事

5
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,360
1941年 八月

6
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:27,760
我说了
I already told you,

7
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,630
我真的什么都不知道
I don't know anything.

8
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,000
求求你了 不要
Please don't.

9
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,070
名字
Your name?

10
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:02,640
我说了啊 布丽吉特
I already told you, Brigitte.

11
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,180
你的真名
Your real name.

12
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:16,840
布丽吉特
Brigitte.

13
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:19,220
撒谎
Liar.

14
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,080
我用我母亲的生命发誓
I swear on my mother's life.

15
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,200
三个月之前

16
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,190
又一条消息 纳粹现在已经占领
In other news, Nazi forces now occupy,

17
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:18,860
波兰 奥地利 丹麦 挪威
Poland, Austria, Denmark, Norway,

18
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,450
捷克斯洛伐克 比利时 荷兰 卢森堡
Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Netherlands, Luxembourg,

19
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:29,140
南斯拉夫 希腊还有法国北部
Yugoslavia, Greece, and Northern France.

20
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,940
现在希特勒正在准备跨越英吉利海峡
Hitler is now poised to cross the English Channel.

21
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,830
我告诉了那些人的家人
I told the gentleman's parents

22
00:04:53,910 --> 00:04:56,200
那是场车祸 没有幸存者
it was a car crash, no survivors.

23
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,440
他们就在那呆了六周
They were only there six weeks.

24
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,090
德国人正在定位我们的信号
The Germans are locating our signals

25
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,400
而且比预期要快得多
faster than anticipated,

26
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,940
还出了点差错
and there was a slip up.

27
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,700
有一位特工还带着英国香烟
One of the agents was carrying British cigarettes.

28
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:11,900
我们实在是太业余了
We're all such bloody amateurs.

29
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:24,150
阿特金斯女士 他们在等您
Ms. Atkins they're waiting for you.

30
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,720
我总是享受不到早晨
Mornings always get away from me.

31
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,370
这就是个基本操作
This is a rudimentary operation,

32
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:33,120
几乎没有任何情报可供参考
there's hardly any intelligence to go on.

33
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:35,700
她来了
She arrives.

34
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,240
我们得谈一下换人的事情了
We need to talk replacements.

35
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,900
我要你负责招募一些女士
I want you in charge of recruiting some ladies.

36
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,760
怎么了 我以为所有人都会反对呢
What happened? I thought everyone was opposed.

37
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,100
我们去见了丘吉尔
Well, we went to Churchill,

38
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:51,430
他发了火冲我们大喊
he growled a bit,

39
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:55,320
但是他也认为女士们会更不引人注目一点
but he agreed women will be more inconspicuous.

40
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,680
然后他说 祝你好运
Then he said, "Good luck to you."

41
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,340
你会像训练男人一样对女人吗
Would you train the women like the men?

42
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,030
我们不会把她们吓走的
We can't afford to scare them off.

43
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,740
她们是平民 不是士兵
They're civilians, not soldiers.

44
00:06:08,820 --> 00:06:11,540
我不知道他们会面对什么
I have no idea of what they're getting into.

45
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,020
让我们准备一下 你觉得呢
Let's prepare them. Don't you think?

46
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,160
阿特金斯女士 确保他们一定要漂亮
Ms. Atkins, make sure they're pretty.

47
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,740
是为了你还是为了德国人
For you or for the Germans?

48
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,720
丘吉尔让我们
Churchill has asked us to

49
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,050
建立一个隐秘的间谍军队
create a secret army of spies.

50
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:35,680
我找到了女士选拔区 法国
I find the ladies ref section, France.

51
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,140
我下周就可以去训练
I can be ready for training next week.

52
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,230
好的
Good.

53
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,620
打扰一下 你好 我是维拉・阿特金斯
Excuse me. Hello, I'm Vera Atkins.

54
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,660
我们能聊一聊吗
May I speak with you?

55
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:50,570
好的
Yes.

56
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,230
这里是美国大使馆
United States embassy,

57
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,140
我能帮你点什么
how may I help you?

58
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:30,490
弗吉尼亚 这个刚到
Virginia, this just arrived.

59
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:41,670
亲爱的霍尔女士 谢谢你
Dear Ms. Hall. Thank you

60
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,720
谢谢你有意成为一名外交官
again for your interest in becoming a diplomat.

61
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,460
鉴于你的情况
Due to your condition,

62
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,360
我们不能给你这个资格
it will not be possible for you to qualify.

63
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,110
朋友们今晚举行派对
Friends having a party tonight.

64
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:08,520
我去不了
I can't.

65
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,360
你看起来需要一杯合适的酒喝喝
You look like you could use a proper drink.

66
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:22,080
在闪电战结束后 我希望
With the Blitz over I was hoping...

67
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,580
但是事情还是一团糟
But things are still a bloody mess

68
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,380
现在又是难民问题
and now with the refugees.

69
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,750
在这一点上可不需要任何犹太人
We certainly don't need anymore Jews here.

70
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,300
反正犹太人在这里也不安全 对吧
Well, Jews aren't really safe here either, are they?

71
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,220
谁还要杜松子酒
More gin anyone?

72
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,510
其实我喜欢喝威士忌
Actually, I'm a whiskey man.

73
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,650
英国人绝不会让德国人
The British would never let the Germans

74
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,810
像那样跳华尔兹舞
waltz in like that.

75
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,520
我向你保证 法国人可以
I can assure you, the French are

76
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:51,300
像华尔兹一样坚实 我去过呢
solid as a waltz. I was there,

77
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:54,360
在投降之前 我在巴黎开过救护车
I drove an ambulance in Paris before the surrender.

78
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,450
比媒体报导都还要糟糕
It's worse than the press reported.

79
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,990
也许吧
Perhaps.

80
00:08:58,460 --> 00:08:59,540
我打算回到巴黎
I plan to go back.

81
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,200
你回不去的
You can't.

82
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,710
走着瞧吧
Watch me.

83
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,280
我们必须惩罚那些混蛋
We must get those bastards.

84
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,960
我觉得我们没见过面
I don't believe we've met.

85
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,280
我是维拉 阿特金斯
Vera Atkins.

86
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,660
我是弗吉尼亚 霍尔.
Virginia Hall.

87
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:20,000
亲爱的总统罗斯福先生
Dear President Roosevelt,

88
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:22,680
我向您写信是告诉你
I'm writing to inform you of disturbing

89
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,980
美国外交部一些充满歧视性的规定
discriminatory regulations in the US Foreign Service.

90
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,860
我非常有资格成为一名外交官
I am more than qualified to be a diplomat.

91
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:32,070
你应该理解残疾并不意味着
You should understand that disability doesn't mean...

92
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:04,310
没带雨伞吗
No umbrella?

93
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,420
从来不带
Never.

94
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:18,240
茶还是苏格兰威士忌
Tea or scotch?

95
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:21,490
苏格兰威士忌就行
Scotch would be lovely.

96
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,320
请坐
Please sit.

97
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:30,880
我会把椅子弄湿
I'll get the chair wet.

98
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,900
没事
Don't worry.

99
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:36,920
我一直都在琢磨你
I've been thinking about you.

100
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:41,050
杜松子酒让我在聚会上有点忘乎所以
I got a little carried away at the party, the gin.

101
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,900
这是给你这位聪明的女士的
Here you are an intelligent woman who,

102
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:48,690
我想 在美国可以住得很舒服
I imagine, could live quite comfortably in America.

103
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,080
你为什么来到这 霍尔女士
What brings you here, Ms. Hall?

104
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,780
自从我记事开始
Ever since I can remember,

105
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,320
我就想成为一名外交官
I've wanted to be a diplomat.

106
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,120
我在这里工作了好几年了
I've been working here for years;

107
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,400
意大利 土耳其 法国
Italy, Turkey, France.

108
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:09,200
我就爱上了那里的人 语言等等
I fell in love with the people, languages,

109
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,630
现在我肯定不会
and I'm certainly not going to turn

110
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:14,240
背弃欧洲
my back on Europe now.

111
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:18,400
要是有更多的美国人也这么想就好了
If only more Americans felt that way.

112
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,400
你为什么不结婚啊
Why aren't you married?

113
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,620
你不是也没结吗
Why aren't you?

114
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,920
我有一个朋友失踪了
I have a missing friend?

115
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,190
抱歉
I'm so sorry.

116
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:34,560
失踪对任何人来说都是个可怕的判决
A terrible verdict for anyone,

117
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:37,120
你不觉得吗
don't you think, missing?

118
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,140
你有追爱人吗
Do you have a fellow?

119
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:56,550
我经历过一起事故 坏疽发作了
I had an accident, gangrene set in.

120
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:59,480
他不觉得这很浪漫
He didn't think it was terribly romantic.

121
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,280
想这看你问谁了 我想
Depends on who you ask, I suppose.

122
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,080
让我们彼此坦诚相待 好吗
Let's be straight with each other, shall we?

123
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:07,660
好
Sure.

124
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:09,520
你我都知道
You and I both know that

125
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,660
美国是肯定不会招募你成为外交官的
America will never hire you to be a diplomat,

126
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,360
所以我想邀请你去
so I'd like to invite you to

127
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,440
试着加入一个你可以参加的组织
try out for a club you can join.

128
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:21,660
专门为像你这样在法国生活过的
A club for women like you who have lived in France,

129
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,080
知晓法语的

131
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,500
你是谁
Who are you?

132
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:33,120
有传言说你是
Rumor has it you are

133
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:35,040
女子辅助空军中
the best wireless operator

134
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:37,380
最好的无线电接线员
in the Women's Auxiliary Air Force.

135
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:41,130
谢谢 我相信这是因为
Thank you. I believe

136
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,470
我会弹竖琴和钢琴的缘故吧
it's because I play the harp and the piano,

137
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:45,680
那些信号就像音乐一样
and signaling is like music.

138
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,640
有节奏的
There is a rhythm to it.

139
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,770
确实啊 你为什么要加入呢
Indeed. Noor, why did you join?

140
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,940
我们都要演奏我们自己的那一部分
We all have to play our part.

141
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,480
那你的那部分是什么呢 努尔
What is your part, Noor?

142
00:12:58,730 --> 00:12:59,300
我没听明白
Sorry?

143
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,400
你出生在俄国
You were born in Russia to

144
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:07,640
你的母亲是美国人 父亲是印度穆斯林
an American mother and an Indian father who was Muslim.

145
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,660
我知道他是上一任莫卧儿皇帝的后裔
A descendant of last Mughal Emperor, I understand.

146
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:13,370
对 我爸爸是
Yes. My father was

147
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,540
西方苏菲教派的创始人
a founder of the Sufi order in the West.

148
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,540
那是什么
and that is?

149
00:13:17,860 --> 00:13:20,090
苏菲派是伊斯兰教精神分支
Sufism is an Islami spiritual path

150
00:13:20,170 --> 00:13:22,670
以和平与真理之名向上帝祈祷
towards God by the means of peace and truth.

151
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,260
你也这么觉得的吧
As are you, correct?

152
00:13:24,260 --> 00:13:26,180
喜欢和平和真理
A lover of peace and truth.

153
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,390
当然了
Of course.

154
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,760
所以你为什么要参与这场战争
So why is this war your fight?

155
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,320
因为我是一名英国人
Because I am a British citizen

156
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,820
我在法国长大这里就像我的家一样
and I grew up in France as my home.

157
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,980
我不能袖手旁观
I cannot just stand by and let

158
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,520
让纳粹做那些事情
the Nazis do what they're doing.

159
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:40,420
就这些吗 努尔
Is that all, Noor?

160
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,480
事实上 我也希望
Well, actually, I also wish

161
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,280
印度能在这场战争中赢得
that an Indian would win

162
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,240
很高的军事声望
high military distinction in this war,

163
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,700
因为如果我们其中的一些人能
because if a few of us could do

164
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,940
在盟军服役中做出一些英勇事迹
something brave in the allied service,

165
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,500
也许能弥补
it might bridge the gap

166
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,140
印度和英国之间的隔阂
between the Indians and the British.

167
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:58,250
现在我明白了
Now I understand.

168
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:03,630
努尔 我今天叫你来这儿
Noor, I called you here

169
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:06,300
是因为我想邀请你
today because I would like to invite you to

170
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:09,480
加入一个与众不同的组织
try out for a club unlike any other.

171
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:16,520
欢迎来到我的苏格兰乡间的家
Welcome to my Scottish country home.

172
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
不是纳粹想象的那种
Not the type of place the Nazis would

173
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:22,360
训练间谍的地方 是吧
expect to be a spy training center, is it?

174
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,320
别想着太舒服
Don't get too comfy,

175
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:26,980
你们当中绝大多数都呆不过一星期
many of you won't last a week.

176
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,280
现在 什么是特别行动局呢
Now, what is the SOE?

177
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:34,240
我们亲切的称之为最新的
Affectionately, we call it our new

178
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:37,320
野蛮战争部
ministry of ungentlemanly warfare.

179
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:41,920
在这儿我们会训练你捣乱和破坏
Here, we will train you in sabotage and subversion.

180
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,210
那些出色的人会派去法国当间谍
Those who excel will go to France as spies.

181
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,090
这里的规定 你们会被给予代号
The rules, you've been given code names.

182
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:52,000
绝不可以把你的真实名字告诉任何人
Do not disclose your real name to anyone here.

183
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:55,310
每一个队伍的任务 获取情报
Each team's mission: acquire information,

184
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:58,740
负隅抵抗 让法国重新发光发亮
build resistance, and set France ablaze.

185
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,980
一点也不温柔
Not at all indepliable

186
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:07,700
就像我说的 这是野蛮的战争
As I said, ungentlemanly warfare.

187
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:11,120
女性间谍 你们要习惯这些
Get used to lady spies.

188
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:27,260
努尔 来我这
Noor, come over here.

189
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,300
你觉得
What do you think,

190
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,220
你能做那样的练习吗
do you think you can do that exercise over there?

191
00:15:32,050 --> 00:15:32,800
可以 长官
Yes, ma'am.

192
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,470
好 给那些男人展示一下战争是怎么赢的
Good. Let's show these boys how this war is won.

193
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,520
是的 长官
Yes, ma'am

194
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:37,420
去吧
Go ahead.

195
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,460
再来两步 快点
Two moves. Come on.

196
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,860
- 你有什么毛病啊  - 我受够了
- What's the matter with you.   - That's it.

197
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,300
记住咱们只有120秒的时间
Remember we only have 120 seconds

198
00:16:08,300 --> 00:16:09,380
然后我们就要离开这儿
then we've got to get out of there.

199
00:16:09,380 --> 00:16:09,960
好的
Yes.

200
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,470
- 这些东西是什么  - 那是天线接线端
- What are these bits going?   - Yes. The aerial terminal.

201
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:14,510
那不是天线接线端
That's not the aerial terminal.

202
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,800
那是天线配对
That's the aerial matching.

203
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,800
我用那边天线接线端
I was using the aerial terminal down there.

204
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:18,200
这个吗
Here?

205
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,440
也许是这里的那个
Maybe its that one here.

206
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,100
主电源 好吧 你说的才是正确的
The mains battery. No, you're right.

207
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,360
会有许多来自欧洲各地的优秀的人来
There'll be many people

208
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,820
协助法国反击
from across Europe aiding in the resistance in France,

209
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,280
他们来自 波兰
amazing people from Poland,

210
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:37,420
德国其他地区 南斯拉夫 捷克斯洛伐克
other parts of Germany, Yugoslavia, Czechoslovakia.

211
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:42,300
挥刀 挥刀 从后边偷袭
Slice, slice, stealth from behind.

212
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,940
把头向后扭 然后挥刀
Move their head back, slice.

213
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,040
你来
You.

214
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,680
要学着敏捷一点
Learn to be quick,

215
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:05,720
自信 必要时要残忍
confident, and when necessary, ruthless.

216
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,060
再见了
Goodbye.

217
00:17:09,150 --> 00:17:12,240
你们将要面对的是孤独的勇者之路
Yours will be a lonely courage,

218
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:14,400
容不得半点差池
but make no mistake.

219
00:17:14,490 --> 00:17:18,700
你们收集的情报 组织的行动
Intelligence you gather, the sabotage you set,

220
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,410
招募的当地群众
the locals you recruit to

221
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:24,370
将改变这场战争的进程
resist will change the course of this war.

222
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:34,630
我连自己的收音机都抬不动
I can't even lift my radio.

223
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,470
而且说实话吧 我必须承认
And frankly, I cannot lie.

224
00:17:36,550 --> 00:17:39,600
我会是个非常失败的间谍
I make a miserable spy.

225
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,640
如果我父亲知道我现在的样子
I wonder what my father would think if

226
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,270
真不知道他会怎么想
he knew my path led me here.

227
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:47,010
我是一个反战主义者
A pacifist and they are

228
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:48,560
现在却在学习如何杀人
teaching us to kill?

229
00:17:48,650 --> 00:17:51,610
他们在教我们如何生存
They are training us to survive.

230
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:56,530
来 试试卡斯伯特 他更轻一些
Here,it's Cuthbert, he's lighter.

231
00:17:56,610 --> 00:18:01,240
这也很重呢 你还给他起了名字
That's heavy too. You named him.

232
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,790
毕竟他是要
Figured he was going to be with

233
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:03,870
陪我度过余生的
me for the rest of my life.

234
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:06,080
最好有个像样的名字
He may as well have a proper name.

235
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,320
森特・卡斯伯特既是战士也是医者
Saint Cuthbert was a soldier and a healer,

236
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:13,580
他是一个奇迹
a performer of miracles.

237
00:18:17,240 --> 00:18:20,920
我父亲亲眼目睹了许多奇迹
My father, he witnessed a lot of miracles.

238
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,760
放心吧 他会为你骄傲的
Your father would be proud.

239
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,490
她可是个公主啊
She's a princess for God's sake.

240
00:18:36,570 --> 00:18:37,530
她非常漂亮 你不觉得吗
Very pretty, don't you agree?

241
00:18:37,610 --> 00:18:39,070
维拉 她是一个反战主义者
She's a pacifist Vera.

242
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:41,450
她还给小孩子写童话故事
She writes fairy tales for children.

243
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,200
你有没有看过她的训练报告
Have you read her training reviews?

244
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:45,410
非常孩子气 一个白日梦想家
Childlike, a daydreamer.

245
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,960
但是她本职工作做得非常优秀
She's good at her job.

246
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,080
这才是最重要的
That's what matters.

247
00:18:48,170 --> 00:18:48,820
她绝对坚持不了六个星期的
She won't last six weeks.

248
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,750
这些女人是精挑细选来到这里的
These women aren't easy to find.

249
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,760
看这张照片 你觉得这个女生像间谍吗
Now, would you suspect this girl's a spy?

250
00:18:57,900 --> 00:19:00,680
我再考虑考虑 无线工作是
I'll think it over. The wireless job is the

251
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,040
危险性最高的 下一个是谁
most risky. Who's next?

252
00:19:09,860 --> 00:19:10,960
弗吉尼亚 一个美国人
Virginia is American.

253
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,680
但是在法国生活过
But has lived in France.

00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,150

259
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:26,620
旅行和打猎 和她父亲一样
traveling and hunting, just like her father.

260
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:29,080
不错 她来这里的目的呢
Interesting. What's she doing here?

261
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,750
给自己的履历增加领事相关经验
Building a resume with consular

262
00:19:30,830 --> 00:19:32,300
因为她想做一名外交官
because she wants to be a diplomat.

263
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,300
我怎么不记得外交部门
I didn't realize the Foreign Service

264
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,560
还招过女性官员
hired female officers.

265
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,970
招过一些 但是
There are a few, but

266
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:41,010
她刚收到拒信
she just received a rejection letter.

267
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:43,760
她的训练结果在不断进步
Her training reports are improving.

268
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,140
虽然弗吉尼亚对自己的能力
Although Virginia lacks appreciation

269
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,220
不太自信
for her own limitations,

270
00:19:47,310 --> 00:19:50,520
但是她足智多谋 是个做领导的苗子
she is resourceful, a leader.

271
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,080
美国没参加这场战争
America isn't in this war.

272
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,150
我们可以给她安排一个记者的身份
We could set her up as a journalist.

273
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,360
在纽约邮报做我们的联络员
There's a contact at the New York Post.

274
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,150
她发布的新闻可以给我们

275
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,150
通风报信 又不会引起注意
going on without setting off alarms.

276
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:03,320
这主意很好 我一直觉得以你的才能
Genius. Always knew your talents

277
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:05,100
做我的秘书是大材小用了
are wasted as my secretary.

278
00:20:06,780 --> 00:20:08,120
天哪 维拉
Good Lord Vera.

279
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,540
她有一条腿是木头做的假腿
She has a wooden leg.

280
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:10,580
简直难以置信
Jesus Christ.

281
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,120
但是那只是膝盖以下
It's only from below the knee and

282
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,130
再说了这是绝佳的伪装

能作出任何违法的事情

让弗吉尼亚开始下一步

为刚才的惊吓向你道歉

293

我们只能通过这样来评估

294
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,500
我们的特工忍受折磨的能力
our agent's ability to withstand torture.

295
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:00,590
盖世太保不会因为你是女人
The Gestapo won't go easy on

296
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,220
就心慈手软
you just because you're a woman.

297
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,380
我也不会因为他们是男人就心慈手软

298
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:07,720

但是我们前线急需

人员 所以我准备给你一次机会

304

如果你真的决定加入我们
If you do decide to join us,

305
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,240

我们不会让你参与

314
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:02,230
所有的外勤工作

我没问题的
I can.

316
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:05,240
你的任务是在法国中部
Your mission is to create a hub in

还可以镇痛

323
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,560
小心使用 吃太多你会不省人事
Use in moderation, you take too many you'll pass out.

324
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,390
弗吉尼亚我们迫切需要
Virginia, we're desperate for

325
00:22:30,470 --> 00:22:33,060
法国的情报信息
information about life in France.

326
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:35,230
没有这些情报 我们的间谍会因此牺牲
Our spies are dying without it.

327
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,620
里昂 1941年9月

328
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:51,780
到达里昂以后 要机灵点
When you get to Lyon don't be fooled.

329
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:56,040
那里虽然没有被占领 民众依然人心惶惶
Even in the unoccupied zone, people are desperate.

330
00:22:57,740 --> 00:23:00,480
平民百姓开始与敌军勾结
Common folks are becoming collaborators.

331
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:07,100
民兵警察也被纳粹控制
Militia police are dominated by the Nazis.

332
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:17,730
一个叫切万医生的法国男人会等你

Good.

339
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,330
你不能和任何特工过于亲近
Stay detached from all agents.

340
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,460
情感会让你优柔寡断
Feelings confuse decisions.

341
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,960
阿方斯特工已经在当地
Agent Alfonse is already on

342
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:49,100
开始了他的无线电工作

343
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:52,180
你稳定下来以后 会有更多特工过去

344
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,700
这个你要保证随身携带
Keep this with you at all times.

345
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:07,100
这是什么
What is this?

346
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:11,240
氰化物 用它终结生命
Cyanide. A more dignified end than

347
00:24:11,410 --> 00:24:12,820
比盖世太保的手段仁慈的多
the Gestapo will give you.

348
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:31,340
切万医生
Dr. Chevain.

349
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:45,700
跟我来
Follow me.

350
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:55,740
布里奇特 我是名医生 我不知道

351
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:57,490
这些事情要如何完成
know how these things are done,

352
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:00,760
我们有情况需要你帮助
but we have a situation.

353
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,740
什么事情
What is it?

354
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:07,120
我的朋友在地下室里藏了一个你们的特工
My friend is hiding one of yours in a basement.

355
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:09,630
他这次登陆时被
He got caught on the webbing of

356
00:25:09,710 --> 00:25:12,440
间谍船的网带抓住了
the spy ship on his landing this time.

357
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,700
他的腿被抢打穿了
Leg is shut out.

358
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:18,020
天哪 你能帮他医治好吗
Jesus. Can you fix him?

359
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,360
没办法 伤势太重了
It's too serious.

360
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,620
你今晚带我去见他
You'll take me to him tonight.

361
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,760
当然 等我最后一位病人离开就带你去
Of course. After my last patient.

362
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:35,900
谢谢
Thank you.

363
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:58,930
他深更半夜敲我的门
He tapped on my door in the middle of the night.

364
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:01,010
他就是这样一路拖着自己的腿过来的
He dragged himself here.

365
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,560
上帝保佑他
Bless his soul.

366
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:08,180
他在这儿再待下去会很危险
It is not safe for him to stay much longer.

367
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:11,460
谢谢你
Thank you.

368
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,840
小心楼梯
Be careful on the stairs

369
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:23,780
他感觉怎么样了
How is he feeling?

370
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,310
你有什么想说的吗
You've something to say?

371
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,430
我觉得我们得送你去医院
I think we need to get you to a hospital.

372
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,440
然后呢
Yeah, and say what?

373
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:45,520
跟医生说这是我从树上摔下来受的伤吗
I fell out of a tree?

374
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,020
你必须得看医生
You need medical attention.

375
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,820
给你 万一生了坏疽
Here. If gangrene sets in-

376
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:54,920
我坚决不去医院
I'm not going to a hospital.

377
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,900
我们都清楚它就在外边
We both know it's out there.

378
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,200
在这儿看医生的风险
The risk of getting help here far

379
00:26:58,280 --> 00:26:59,990
可比生坏疽更高吧
outweigh the possibility of gangrene.

380
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:01,990
就用无线电发个消息就好了
Just get a message to the Wireless.

381
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:04,040
让伦敦的人想办法把我带出去
London has to find me a way out.

382
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,330
我不知道无线站在哪里
I don't know where Wireless is.

383
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:12,880
什么叫你不知道他在哪儿
What do you mean you don't know where he is?

384
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,630
我才刚到这里 谁知道要多久联络员才会
I just got here. It could be days before my courier

385
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,900
联系我 那时候我才能给无线站发信息
makes contact and I can pass along a message to Wireless.

386
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:25,780
老天 那你觉得我们接下来怎么办
Jesus. What do you think we should do?

387
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,760
带你出去 就这么办
Get you out. That's what.

388
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,940
来自德国残忍的暴行正在
...cruel violence is spreading

389
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:37,260
欧洲大地上蔓延
throughout the German occupied Europe.

390
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,110
希特勒已经犯下大罪
The crime of Hitler,

391
00:27:40,110 --> 00:27:44,220
不能再让我们热爱的祖国受苦

392
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:09,420
等一下

00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:16,520
我们只是想保家人平安
We just want to keep our families safe.

425
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,780
我都理解
Je comprends.

426
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:19,800
我理解你们
I understand.

427
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:22,240
袖手旁观后是很安全
Sitting on the sidelines seems safe.

428
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:25,050
但德国人就指望你们什么都不做
You doing nothing is what the Germans are counting on.

429
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,540
我们可以做些什么
What can we do?

430
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,680
奋起抵抗
Resist.

431
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,060
你的朋友告诉我们
Your friend told us

432
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,100
你可能会愿意帮忙
that you might be willing to help.

433
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,100
真的万分感谢
Thank you very, very much.

434
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,240
吉恩今晚在这和你碰头 把这印上两千份
Jean will meet you tonight to print two thousand copies.

435
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,700
我会搞定的
I'll take care of it.

436
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,280
分发给工人们
Distribute these amongst the workers.

437
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,640
我来时没想到一切会如此绝望
When I arrived, I didn't expect to see so much despair.

438
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:54,830
农民们必须向德国人
Farmers must deliver

439
00:31:54,910 --> 00:31:56,960
上交惩罚性份额的农产
punishing quotas of their produce to the Germans.

440
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:02,210
人人都在挨饿 我刚拿到配给卡
People are hungry. I got my ration card and found that

441
00:32:02,290 --> 00:32:04,340
发现我一天只能买大概半斤面包
I'm allowed only 10 ounces of bread a day

442
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,090
一周只有一两芝士
and two ounces of cheese per week.

443
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,880
意大利面 米和巧克力甚至不供应
No rations of spaghetti, rice, or chocolate.

444
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,780
法国的法律在不断被修改
The French laws keep changing.

445
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,120
周日开始禁酒
No alcohol is allowed on Sundays anymore.

446
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,980
最新颁布的法令规定
And the latest,

447
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:23,100
女人禁买香烟
women are forbidden from buying cigarettes.

448
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,580
最令人不安的消息是
The most concerning news,

449
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:30,400
犹太人现被要求到政府注册
Jews are now required to register with the government.

450
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,780
我们有位探员受伤了
We've got an injured agent.

451
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,680
需要来架飞机接人
The next flying plane needs to land.

452
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:44,900
好的 我会通知他们的
Brilliant. I'll let them know.

453
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,820
巴克 起来了 巴克
Buck, Buke, wake up.

454
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:30,630
搞什么 他可是我们最有价值的人员之一
Bloody hell. He's one of our most valuable assets.

455
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
让弗吉尼亚把着陆坐标发过来
Tell Virginia to provide landing coordinates.

456
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:34,920
好的
Right.

457
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:42,020
回家吧 巴克
Buck, go home.

458
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,310
我会留在这儿 回去看看安娜和孩子们
I'll stay. Go and see Anna and the children.

459
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,650
不行 没有假期
No. No holidays.

460
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,520
没有周末 没有休息
No weekends. No time off.

461
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,610
我不能错过任何事
Can't afford to let anything slip.

462
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:52,020
做事吧
Come on.

463
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:52,840
好
Right.

464
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:19,160
这地方做降落道太短了
I mean, for landing strip it's too short.

465
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,240
正好360米
It's just shy of 400 yards.

466
00:35:21,330 --> 00:35:22,120
应该能做到的
It can be done.

467
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,220
从理论上来说
Technically.

468
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,290
直接尝试是愚蠢的选择
It's pretty stupid to try.

469
00:35:29,370 --> 00:35:32,250
我们要不试 他就会死在这里
If we don't try, he dies here.

470
00:35:33,860 --> 00:35:34,540
我知道
I know.

471
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:49,680
行吧
All right.

472
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,900
飞机停留时间不能超过10分钟
The plane can't be on the ground longer than 10 minutes.

473
00:35:52,220 --> 00:35:53,500
我们5分钟就能搞定
We'll do it in five.

474
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:14,290
弗吉尼亚找到场地了 这是降落坐标
Landing coordinates, Virginia found us a field.

475
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,300
谢天谢地
Thank God.

476
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,820
马克发信晚了
Mark was late

477
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,010
他的核心码遗漏了一段
and he left out the first part to his core site.

478
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:21,470
电码缺失常有发生 阿特金斯小姐
Code mutilations happen everyday, Miss Atkins.

479
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:23,140
我不明白你为啥要盯着它
I don't see why you feel the need to

480
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,840
那是里欧的工作
babysit the signal and that's Leo's job.

481
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,600
这可能是个警告
It could be a warning.

482
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,440
万一马克被德国人控制了呢
What if Mark is being controlled by the Germans?

483
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:31,060
是可能 但也可能只是信号被干扰了
Yes, and it could be another signal interference.

484
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,940
听着 一位重要的探员正奄奄一息
Look, a valuable asset is dying.

485
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:34,610
我们得把他接回来治好他
We need to get him back and fixed.

486
00:36:34,690 --> 00:36:35,690
今天月色刚好
You have the moon tonight.

487
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:38,320
我们不能再等整整一个月再送飞机过去
We can't wait another month of sending a bloody plane.

488
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,380
如果我们要送飞机过去
If we are already sending a plane,

489
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:43,240
那还需要更多无线电报员在活动
we need more wireless operators in action.

490
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,580
我们可没太多选择
We don't have many to choose from.

491
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:57,170
让努尔去 她打电码速度惊人
Send Noor. She transposes messages in record time.

492
00:36:57,250 --> 00:36:59,500
她还没受过最后的实战演练
We haven't given her the final level of field training yet.

493
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,550
她能应付的
She'll be fine.

494
00:37:00,630 --> 00:37:01,590
她需要更多
She needs more...

495
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:02,350
你在开玩笑吗
Are you kidding？

496
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:04,340
我总算毫无保留地打算做这事
I've finally put aside my reservations on that.

497
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,930
但是巴克 我还是认为
Still Buck, I think that we still...

498
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,220
我没问你该死的想法
Goddammit. I didn't ask what you thought.

499
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:10,520
努尔今天就跟机离开
The plane leaves tonight and Noor is on it.

500
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,060
让她准备好 阿特金斯小姐
Prepare her, Miss Atkins.

501
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,520
你为什么留下她
Why do you keep her in the room?

502
00:37:20,740 --> 00:37:21,820
她聪明绝顶
She's smart as a whip,

503
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:23,820
观察力无与伦比
and her attention to detail is incomparable,

504
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:25,460
为她再多麻烦也值得
nothing is too much trouble for her.

505
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,370
那些只是传言而已
They're all rumors.

506
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,540
你的意思是
Meaning?

507
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,800
我以为她的名字是假的
I thought her name was fake.

508
00:37:31,300 --> 00:37:32,790
她是罗马尼亚地区的犹太人
That she's a Romanian jew.

509
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,660
她口音听起来也很奇怪
Plus her accent is off.

510
00:37:36,040 --> 00:37:37,860
阿特金斯小姐在国外长大
Miss Atkins grew up abroad.

511
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,260
她和你一样应召入局
She was put through the calls just like you.

512
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:42,280
我们没有发现任何可疑的记录
We found no traces of anything suspect.

513
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:45,800
开战前她就为英国情报系统作出卓越贡献
She was very helpful to British Intel before the war

514
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,760
她是被极力推荐来的
and she came highly recommended.

515
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,770
我只是说不是这里的每个人
All I'm saying is not everyone around here

516
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,060
都和你一样相信她
trusts her the way you do.

517
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:14,330
别让他们孤军奋战

518
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:27,980
来杯茶吗
Tea?

519
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,220
好的
Yeah.

520
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,820
你记得我一直在告诉你
You know I've been telling you that

521
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:46,200
我正在为出国受训
I've been training to go abroad?

522
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,580
我今晚就得走了
I have to go tonight.

523
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,130
为什么
Why?

524
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,500
他们要把你送去哪里
Where are they sending you?

525
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,540
你知道我们不能谈论这些的
You know we're not allowed to talk about it.

526
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:03,300
但妈 我们都知道这迟早要发生的不是吗
But Mom, we knew this was going to happen, didn't we?

527
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:11,800
求你别走 你的家人需要你留在这里
Please don't go, your family needs you here.

528
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,180
我需要你的理解
I need your understanding.

529
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,540
我必须得做点什么
I have to do something.

530
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,400
你还记得教义的那句老话吗
You remember the Sufi saying?

531
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,200
你还不懂吗
Don't you know yet,

532
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:29,580
汝之光芒将明耀世界
it's your light that lights the world.

533
00:39:30,600 --> 00:39:32,320
对呀 这也是为什么我必须得去
Yes, that's why I must go.

534
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:09,610
给你
Here.

535
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,660
你的确是面面俱到啊
You do think of everything, don't you?

536
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,450
到了就马上往回报信
Message us as soon as you arrive

537
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:16,910
确保常常更换驻地
and make sure you change locations often.

538
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,170
这样他们才没法定位到你的信号
So that they don't locate your signals.

539
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:20,960
好的女士
Yes, ma'am.

540
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:21,980
这是你的电报机
This is your wireless.

541
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,800
如果你有任何迟疑
If you have any doubts,

542
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:29,780
现在就告诉我
tell me now.

543
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:32,800
在这里也有很多方法能在战争中尽一份力
There are ways to help the war effort here.

544
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,940
不了女士 我已经决定了
No, ma'am, I'm resolved.

545
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,680
我有能力战斗 但我奋起的源头并非仇恨
I can fight, my resistance is not motivated by hate.

546
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:43,320
很好
Good.

547
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:47,840
这胸针很漂亮
That's a beautiful pin,

548
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:49,900
是只田凫对吗
it's a lap wing, isn't it?

549
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:52,450
是的 给你
Yes. Here.

550
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,660
我不能收下
No, I couldn't.

551
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:54,620
你必须得收下
No, you must.

552
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,060
作为我们的首位女性无线电报员
Our first female wireless.

553
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,780
恭喜你 马德琳
Congratulations, Madeline.

554
00:41:06,320 --> 00:41:07,080
敬自由
Liberte!

555
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,580
祝你好运
Good luck to you.

556
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:22,780
妈妈您好呀
Hello mama?

557
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:25,140
你也好
Hello darling.

558
00:41:36,380 --> 00:41:41,480
是呀 失踪的士兵肯定往往都会归家
Yeah. Missing soldiers turn up all the time.

559
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,220
我们在这里已经等很久了
We've been here through long holiday.

560
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,550
这感觉不太安全
This feels dangerous.

561
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:01,160
我们都在这儿了 总得熬过去
We are here now, seen it through.

562
00:42:15,910 --> 00:42:16,520
我来
I got this.

563
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:19,340
马德琳 是你
Madeline.

564
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,660
布里奇特吗

我们只呆呆一到两个晚上
Just a night or two.

573
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,220
我会很快找到新得安全屋
I'll find another safehouse for us soon.

574
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:05,020
你在这儿冷吗
Are you warm enough here?

575
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,440
欢迎来到这里 马德琳

您好 我们能聊聊吗

我需要为我们的探员找个安全屋

583
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:05,760
警察绝不会找来这里

584
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:09,730
我们不能再接纳更多的人了
We cannot accommodate additional guests.

585
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:13,380
我都只能勉强支撑这些修女生活
I can barely feed our nuns as it is.

586
00:44:17,610 --> 00:44:19,580
如果我能找到额外的饭票
What if I could find extra food coupons?

587
00:44:23,880 --> 00:44:25,580
那我们也可以找到居所
Then we could find homes.

588
00:44:48,980 --> 00:44:51,560
布里奇特说这里士气低落

四处都有纳粹间谍

00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:28,180
我们从你房间里检测到了非法无线电信号

Come.

601
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:40,320
我最近的新病人越来越有意思了
As of late my new patients have become a lot more interesting.

602
00:46:49,130 --> 00:46:51,050
我今晚没地方安置马德琳了
I have no place for Madeline tonight.

603
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:54,890
你还有其他同情心丰厚的朋友吗
Do you have any more friends who might be sympathetic?

604
00:46:55,640 --> 00:46:57,530
有阁楼或是地下室的
An attic? A basement?

605
00:46:58,860 --> 00:46:59,960
我有间地下室
I have a basement.

606
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:09,640
既然我帮了你这个忙

607

我想要点回报
I expect something in return.

608
00:47:12,920 --> 00:47:13,830
好吧
Okay.

609
00:47:13,910 --> 00:47:16,280
你需要找个人来治好你的跛脚
You need to see someone about your limp.

610
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:23,380
不是跛脚 这是一只木腿
It's not a limp. It's a wooden leg.

611
00:47:24,330 --> 00:47:28,970
我还以为
Oh, I thought maybe you,

612
00:47:29,740 --> 00:47:31,390
你在空降法国的时候
you hurt it on your way

613
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:33,350
伤到了腿
into France, in parachute landing.

614
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:39,920
你的腿是怎么弄的
How did it happen?

615
00:47:42,890 --> 00:47:43,690
介意和我说说吗
Do you mind?

616
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:49,480
我想的是你会不会介意 我们在吃东西
I guess the question is do you mind? We're eating.

617
00:47:51,610 --> 00:47:54,750
我是个内科医生 有强大的胃
I'm a physician, strong stomach.

618
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,200
我家的避暑别墅在一个农场上
My family summer home is on a farm.

619
00:48:05,210 --> 00:48:07,180
我爱打猎
I love to hunt.

620
00:48:07,180 --> 00:48:10,140
我和几个朋友出去猎鸟
I went out with some friends to hunt birds.

621
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:15,930
我甚至带了我父亲最喜欢的猎枪
I'd even brought my father's favorite shotgun,

622
00:48:16,020 --> 00:48:18,920
我把枪管朝下 就像之前我学的一样
barrel pointing down as I was taught to do.

623
00:48:22,330 --> 00:48:23,900
但是有一道不牢固的篱笆
There was a wobbly fence.

624
00:48:32,870 --> 00:48:33,700
坏疽开始发作
Gangrene was setting in

625
00:48:33,780 --> 00:48:35,420
并且这个决定不得不做
and a decision had to be made.

626
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:41,080
我昏迷了 医生给我治好了
I was unconscious, so the doctor made it for me.

627
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:44,880
那太可怕了
That's devastating.

628
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:52,160
首先 我想也许我可以把我的腿找回来
First, I thought maybe I'd get my leg back somehow,

629
00:48:56,780 --> 00:48:59,050
但我们都知道奇迹不会发生
but we all know miracles don't happen.

630
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:01,730
你可以说 我可以倾听
You may talk and I may listen

631
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:04,310
奇迹就可能发生
and miracles might happen.

639
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:06,130
德国人才是我们的敌人 犹太人不是
The Germans are the enemy... not the Jews.

640
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:14,960
我还从未见过这么多的仇恨

645
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,020
我没想到我会这么快被抓住
I didn't think I'd get caught so quickly.

646
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:03,480
你在这里会安全的

706
00:55:45,530 --> 00:55:46,920
我被告知的是
All I've been told is,

707
00:55:48,700 --> 00:55:50,700
你不能拿到你的公民身份证
"You're not getting your citizenship papers."

708
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:55,770
就因为我是犹太人吗
Because I'm Jewish?

709
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:14,540
作为敌人的公民
My intelligence work will be

710
00:56:14,620 --> 00:56:17,280
我的情报工作将会受到怀疑
suspect as a citizen of the enemy.

711
00:56:18,250 --> 00:56:20,380
如果被其他人发觉
If anyone else here found out.

712
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:21,960
如果他们发觉了
If they do, I will

713
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,420
我会提醒他们 你们的情报工作
remind them that your intelligence efforts have always

714
00:56:24,510 --> 00:56:26,800
是非官方的 不用担心
been unofficial and not to worry

715
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,510
从技术层面讲你只是个秘书
that technically your rank is only that of a secretary.

716
00:56:29,590 --> 00:56:32,550
任何人没有英国文件的人都是可有可无的
Who is dispensable without British papers.

717
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:35,470
对我来说是不可或缺的
Indispensable to me.

718
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:39,020
爬上去会很难
Upstairs can be difficult.

719
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:41,140
他们安于现状
They're comfortable with things

720
00:56:41,140 --> 00:56:45,940
但我会保守你的秘密
as they are and your secret is safe with me.

721
00:57:11,930 --> 00:57:15,640
现在我们是命运的主人
Now we are the masters of our fate,

722
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,720
摆在我们面前的任务

723
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:19,690
并非超出我们的能力范围
us is not above our strength;

724
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:24,150
它带来的苦难并非超出我们承受范围
that its pangs and toils are not beyond our endurance.

725
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,400
他还没讲完
He wasn't done.

726
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:30,110
这该死的垃圾
It's bloody rubbish.

727
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,730
我的公民证 他们不同意
My citizenship papers, they said, no.

728
00:57:43,120 --> 00:57:49,120
妈妈 每次有人来敲门
Mama, every time there's a knock on our door,

729
00:57:49,820 --> 00:57:54,170
我都担心他们会来驱逐我们
I fear that they are coming to deport me, every time.

730
00:57:56,410 --> 00:57:59,390
我以为我们可以在这里重塑我们的生活
I thought that we could remake our lives here.

731
00:57:59,470 --> 00:58:02,560
我以为会很安全
I thought it would be safe.

732
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:12,300
1941年12月7日星期日
On Sunday, December 7th, 1941,

733
00:58:13,180 --> 00:58:16,530

我们会战胜这场有预谋的入侵

美国人民将凭借正义的力量

739
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,310
弗吉尼亚的身份没有用了

740
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:43,060
美国记者现在不允许在法国境内
American reporters won't be allowed in France now.

741
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:44,810
那就要给她搞一个法式伪装
We'll get her a French disguise.

742

她需要回来休息一下

743
00:58:46,980 --> 00:58:48,980
她不想休息

744
00:58:49,070 --> 00:58:51,610
她的领导能力已经超出了预期

745
00:58:51,690 --> 00:58:52,780
我们需要她在场

但是她的口音
But her accent.

她是戏剧联盟的负责人

749

需要改变一下发型

750

换一个新的代号

751

它意味着力量

不好意思 先生 对不起

马克还在战场上

巴黎比维希更难攻破

女人可以在被占领的

我们只会在这里待很短一段时间

01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,460
不会成功的
It's not going to work.

848
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:56,570
阿方斯
Alfonse!

849
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:58,990
这位是菲洛梅娜
This is Philomen, head

850
01:09:59,070 --> 01:10:00,110
海克泰尔路线的头领
of the hectare circuit,

851
01:10:00,200 --> 01:10:02,660
这边是SOE特工保罗和乔治
and SOE agents Paul and George,

852
01:10:02,740 --> 01:10:05,240
本地机械师 他会协助我们的爆炸
local mechanic, he'll be assisting us with explosives.

853
01:10:05,330 --> 01:10:06,290
谢谢
Thank you.

854
01:10:06,370 --> 01:10:08,370
但是我们的时间不多了
But we will not have much time.

855
01:10:08,450 --> 01:10:10,410
那列弹药车
The ammunition shipment,

856
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:13,560
天黑后30分钟内就会经过
it passes with 30 minutes after dark.

857
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:18,740
或许我们可以多找些人
Perhaps we could get more hands.

858
01:10:19,050 --> 01:10:20,380
我可以加入
I can join.

859
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:24,420
不行 女人不应该上一线
No. Women shouldn't be in the field.

860
01:10:24,850 --> 01:10:26,220
话虽如此 保罗
Yes, they shouldn't, Paul.

861
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:29,680
尤其是你 会有很多需要跑步的地方
Certainly not you. There's a lot of running involved.

862
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,760
我们都在爆炸中受过训练
We were all trained in explosives.

863
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,860
你算老几在这儿发号施令
Who the hell are you to give orders?

864
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,960
- 我的指令来自伦敦  - 好了 好了
- My orders come from London.   - Alright, alright.

865
01:10:41,960 --> 01:10:45,960
我们都是一边的 对吧 所以
Look, well, we're on the same side, right? So...

866
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,460
保罗 阻止这列弹药车
Paul, stopping this ammunition shipment

867
01:10:51,460 --> 01:10:53,200
可以挽救上千人的性命
will save thousands of lives.

868
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:11,390
我的上一份工作是在一家法国汽车公司
My previous job at a French motor companies

869
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:13,200
对我做这个真是一点帮助都没有
certainly didn't prepare me for this.

870
01:11:17,230 --> 01:11:19,650
外面可能有很多的爆炸 维拉
There could be many explanations, Vera.

871
01:11:19,650 --> 01:11:21,320
努尔之前也迟到过
Noor's been late before.

872
01:11:21,660 --> 01:11:26,040
这个新的宵禁搞乱了所有人的计划
This new curfew's mucking up everyone's scheds.

873
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:30,700
你最近招的新人们工作很厉害
Your latest recruits have been doing impressive work,

874
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:34,870
而弗吉尼亚尤其突出
and Virginia has been spectacular.

875
01:11:35,320 --> 01:11:39,280
你是对的 找得好
You are right about her. Good find.

876
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,220
希望他们今晚能顺利吧
Let's hope they pull it off tonight.

877
01:11:43,620 --> 01:11:45,680
如果我们搞垮了一列弹药车
If we could derail an ammunition shipment that

878
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:48,560
那就真的是个好消息了
would certainly be good news.

879
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,850
停下
Stop!

880
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,640
是警察
It's the police!

881
01:12:35,930 --> 01:12:37,520
我说了停下
I said stop!

882
01:13:11,540 --> 01:13:15,340
好吧 现在我们的无线电在他们手上了
Well, they now have our wireless.

883
01:13:22,100 --> 01:13:25,190
不 现在最需要担心的是乔治
No, the most pressing concern right now is George.

884
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:28,240
而且他没有受过训练
And he hasn't been trained.

885
01:13:32,140 --> 01:13:35,040
天知道他被为难了会把什么说出去
God knows what he might divulge under challenging circumstances.

886
01:13:35,040 --> 01:13:36,500
老天
Christ.

887
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:40,500
乔治是机械师
George is the mechanic.

888
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:43,700
他会开锁吗
Can he pick the lock?

889
01:13:43,700 --> 01:13:44,500
用什么
With what?

890
01:13:45,480 --> 01:13:46,320
扳手
A wrench.

891
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,980
对 因为监狱里给每个人都发扳手的
Yes, because they do hand out wrenches in prisons.

892
01:13:54,760 --> 01:13:57,270
如果我们能把扳手藏在包裹里呢
What if we could hide the wrench in a package.

893
01:13:57,350 --> 01:14:00,730
日内瓦公约规定了允许人道主义团体
The Geneva Convention allows for humanitarian groups to

894
01:14:00,730 --> 01:14:02,270
给囚犯送关怀包裹
deliver care packages to prisoners.

895
01:14:02,270 --> 01:14:03,230
他们会检查关怀包裹
They check care packages.

896
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:04,460
包括游戏
Including games.

897
01:14:05,680 --> 01:14:07,800
如果只是个无害的游戏 有什么好查的
I mean if it's an innocent game, what's there to check?

898
01:14:08,460 --> 01:14:09,760
你他妈疯了
This is bloody insane.

899
01:14:10,760 --> 01:14:12,480
我可以让伊莎贝拉做这件事
I could ask Isabella to do it.

900
01:14:13,760 --> 01:14:17,820
她是抵抗组织里看起来最像慈善家的
She's a resistance member who looks charitable.

901
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:21,580
我不确定 我们需要更多时间想想
I don't know. We need more time to think.

902
01:14:21,670 --> 01:14:23,220
我们没有时间了保罗
We don't have time, Paul.

903
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:33,420
那就试试吧
Yeah, why not.

904
01:15:02,940 --> 01:15:04,120
天啊
Oh Gosh.

905
01:15:22,430 --> 01:15:23,960
拿的什么
What do you have there?

906
01:15:43,910 --> 01:15:45,900
挺好 来玩吧
Good. Let's play.

907
01:15:46,670 --> 01:15:48,680
这些是给囚犯的 先生
It's for the prisoner, sir.

908
01:15:48,920 --> 01:15:52,050
我们玩完就会给他们了 放下吧
They can have it when we're done. Put it down here.

909
01:16:15,660 --> 01:16:16,960
他们不来了
They're not coming.

910
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,420
我们不能走
We're not going anywhere.

911
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,360
今晚就这样吧
Let's pack it up for tonight.

912
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:43,920
不过我明天还会来继续的
But I'll be back tomorrow for a rematch.

913
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,620
让她给囚犯送去
Bring her to the prisoners.

914
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,250
用来消磨长夜
To pass the time tonight.

915
01:17:14,340 --> 01:17:16,160
你太善良了
That's nice of you.

916
01:17:19,930 --> 01:17:21,140
关灯了
Lights out!

917
01:17:41,530 --> 01:17:42,660
谢天谢地
Thank God!

918
01:17:44,370 --> 01:17:45,370
出发
Let's go.

919
01:18:03,380 --> 01:18:04,500
你们怎么了
What is going on here?

920
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:09,700
有什么问题吗 先生
Is there a problem, sir?

921
01:18:12,860 --> 01:18:14,690
宵禁时间都过了你们还在干嘛
What are you all doing past curfew hour?

922
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,740
我们并不想惹事
We don't want to cause trouble.

923
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:25,780
全部跪下 立刻
Get on your knees, all of you. Now!

924
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,830
先生 我们有点误会
Sir, there’s a misunderstanding.

925
01:18:33,580 --> 01:18:35,900
你的口音 不是本地的
Your accent... it’s not from around here.

926
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:09,160
菲洛梅娜 带他们离开这儿 快
Philomen, get them out of here. Go now.

927
01:19:09,240 --> 01:19:10,620
走吧
Let's go.

928
01:19:13,250 --> 01:19:16,400
阿方斯 阿方斯
Alfonse? Alfonse?

929
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:33,060
看呐 上帝听见了我的祈祷
You see, He listened to my prayers.

930
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:37,200
我们会照顾好他们的
We will take good care of them.

931
01:19:37,200 --> 01:19:38,450
太谢谢女士
Thanks, sister.

932
01:19:40,070 --> 01:19:41,650
记住 他们知道你是谁了
Remember, they know who you are now.

933
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:44,570
在我找到办法送你回伦敦前留在这儿
Stay here until I organize a way to get you back to London.

934
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,860
但是你们没有无线电了
But you won't have a wireless.

935
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:49,240
我们会想办法的
We'll manage.

936
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,390
下一条新闻 为了维持战争机器的运转
In other news, to keep their war machine going,

937
01:20:48,470 --> 01:20:50,360
纳粹加强了他们在法国的所谓
the Nazis are tightening their grip on

938
01:20:50,360 --> 01:20:53,060
无主之地的压榨
the so-called unoccupied part of France.

939
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:55,980
法国居民被抓壮丁后

940
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:59,060
作为劳役送往德国工作

941
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:28,430
努尔
Noor?

942
01:21:28,510 --> 01:21:29,340
吉赛尔
Giselle?

943
01:21:29,680 --> 01:21:31,560
我就知道是你
I thought it was you!

944
01:21:31,760 --> 01:21:33,100
天啊 你还好吗
Oh my God! How are you?

945
01:21:36,020 --> 01:21:37,760
你在这儿做什么
What are you doing here?

946
01:21:39,140 --> 01:21:40,440
有点复杂
It's complicated.

947
01:21:40,520 --> 01:21:42,230
你看起来很需要来杯茶
You look like you could really use a cup of tea.

948
01:21:42,310 --> 01:21:44,610
是的 那样就好了
Yes, that would be lovely.

949
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,280
见到你太高兴了
I'm so happy to see you.

950
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:49,950
你都想象不到
You can't even imagine.

951
01:21:57,370 --> 01:22:00,670
吉赛尔 我已经在巷子里睡了好几天了
Giselle, I've been sleeping in alleys for days.

952
01:22:01,380 --> 01:22:03,460
我没有地方去了
I have nowhere to go.

953
01:22:05,180 --> 01:22:06,260
你能帮帮我吗
Can you help me?

954
01:22:07,440 --> 01:22:11,010
我有家人努尔 万一有人发现
I have a family, Noor. If anyone finds out...

955
01:22:11,090 --> 01:22:13,550
吉赛尔 几千犹太人消失了

Now innocent French children are being marked with yellow stars.

957

Aren't you afraid?

958
01:22:23,150 --> 01:22:25,950
求你了 看在法国的份上
Please... for France?

959

A few days.

967
01:23:13,660 --> 01:23:16,940
下次传信我们会给出替代的降落坐标
Next message we'll send coordinates for parachute replacements.

968
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:18,560

I'd do anything to get my hands on that limping bitch's throat.

977
01:25:10,740 --> 01:25:13,030
把这些文件分发到整个法国

宣传词别那么冲

979

987
01:26:40,200 --> 01:26:41,070
怎么了
What's wrong?

988
01:26:47,550 --> 01:26:49,370
他们知道你是上百名间谍的领导了
They know you are the leader of hundreds of spies.

989
01:26:49,450 --> 01:26:50,710
有什么人认出你然后上报
It's only a matter of time before

990
01:26:50,790 --> 01:26:52,250
只是时间的问题
somebody recognizes you and speaks.

991
01:26:52,330 --> 01:26:54,330
德国人不找到你不会罢休的
The Germans will stop at nothing until they find you.

992
01:26:54,420 --> 01:26:56,890
你得坐火车南下去佩皮尼昂
You need to take the train South to Perpignon.

993
01:26:57,090 --> 01:26:58,780
你得赶紧走了
You need to go now.

994
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:04,180
我不会放弃 我们不会放弃的
I'm not giving up. We're not giving up.

995
01:27:05,500 --> 01:27:06,220
祝你好运
Good luck.

996
01:27:30,410 --> 01:27:32,710
对于任何帮助间谍
This is the punishment for anyone...

997
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:35,710
背叛元首的人 这就是惩罚
who is caught aiding spies and betraying the Führer.

998
01:28:45,950 --> 01:28:47,410
她在哪
Where is she?

999
01:28:48,120 --> 01:28:50,330
我不知道您的问题的答案
You are asking me questions and I do not know the answers.

1000
01:28:50,990 --> 01:28:53,120
她怎么会什么都告诉我
Why would she have told me anything?

1001
01:28:53,410 --> 01:28:54,500
我就是个医生而已
I am a doctor.

1002
01:28:54,870 --> 01:28:56,920
我的工作就是治病救人 仅此而已
I am healing people, that's it.

1003
01:29:12,850 --> 01:29:13,850
她在哪里
Where is she?

1004
01:29:14,430 --> 01:29:15,520
我不知道
I don't know.

1005
01:29:27,820 --> 01:29:29,680
现在就离开 到处都在捉捕你

1006
01:29:29,680 --> 01:29:31,340
火车坐到佩皮尼昂

1007
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:32,900
有人在那里等你

1008
01:30:08,900 --> 01:30:11,200
这就是我们处理间谍的方式
This is what we do with spies.

1009
01:30:50,450 --> 01:30:52,450
请买到佩皮尼昂
Perpignan, si vous plait.

1010
01:31:09,460 --> 01:31:11,340
加油 祝你好运
Bon courage

1011
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:15,550
谢谢
Merci.

1012
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:52,840
你都做了什么
What have you done?

1013
01:31:52,930 --> 01:31:53,970
我所做的都是为了你
I did this for you.

1014
01:31:54,510 --> 01:31:55,680
为了我们能填饱肚子
For you to eat.

1015
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:48,440
快走 婊子 快走
Move it you dirty whore! Keep moving.

1016
01:34:25,760 --> 01:34:26,620
我们已经发现了你的密码本
I found your notebook.

1017
01:34:27,940 --> 01:34:28,880
我们掌握了你所有的代码
We have all your codes.

1018
01:34:36,830 --> 01:34:42,930
我再问一遍 她是谁
I'm going to ask one more time, who is she?

1019
01:34:54,570 --> 01:34:57,400
忠诚 你高估了它的价值
Loyalty. It's overrated.

1020
01:35:01,240 --> 01:35:02,660
你们地下线路的人向我们告密
Someone in your circuit tipped us off to

1021
01:35:02,740 --> 01:35:03,700
揭发了你的朋友
your friend.

1022
01:35:09,620 --> 01:35:12,250
用马德琳的名义传送代码
Start transmitting as Madeline.

1023
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:42,650
马德琳发来了地点坐标
Madeline sent the coordinates for

1024
01:35:42,740 --> 01:35:43,860
可以被空投的新的替换成员的地点
the replacement is to be parachuted,

1025
01:35:43,950 --> 01:35:45,450
但是有个问题
but there's a problem.

1026
01:35:46,240 --> 01:35:47,660
她的代码正确无误
Her code is perfect.

1027
01:35:49,310 --> 01:35:49,790
然后呢
So?

1028
01:35:51,200 --> 01:35:52,780
没有任何错误
There's not a single mistake.

1029
01:35:53,760 --> 01:35:54,580
是啊 她很棒
Well she's good.

1030
01:35:54,670 --> 01:35:56,590
是的 但是每次总会有一两个错误的
Yes, but there's always a mistake or two.

1031
01:35:56,670 --> 01:35:57,670
但是这次是一个错误都没有的
This one's perfect.

1032
01:35:57,750 --> 01:35:59,100
里欧 你在说什么
What are you saying, Leo?

1033
01:36:01,150 --> 01:36:04,220
我在说这个代码文件的风格是不同的
I'm saying the style on this one is different.

1034
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:06,220
她的安全检测是正确的吗
Her security check is correct?

1035
01:36:07,100 --> 01:36:07,760
是的
Yes.

1036
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,700
你在推测
You're speculating.

1037
01:36:12,260 --> 01:36:13,270
就是感觉不对
It doesn't feel right.

1038
01:36:13,350 --> 01:36:14,600
我们现在得通过直觉去行动
We're acting on feelings now,

1039
01:36:14,690 --> 01:36:18,610
是吧 你的意见呢
are we? What's your opinion?

1040
01:36:19,800 --> 01:36:22,200
我们的无线电情报员是无法孤立存活的
We have a wireless who won't survive alone

1041
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:27,180
巴克 我不知道 不是很清楚
I don't know Buck it's not clear.

1042
01:36:33,060 --> 01:36:34,540
空降那些代替人员
Parachute those replacements

1043
01:36:34,620 --> 01:36:36,790
到她提供的地点坐标
to her proposed coordinates.

1044
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:42,380
我们在佩皮尼昂开始
We begin here in Perpignon.

1045
01:36:42,460 --> 01:36:44,680
走内陆摆脱巡查
go inland to avoid the patrols.

1046
01:36:44,760 --> 01:36:47,050
穿过这片大山要走35英里
It's 35 miles across the mountain.

1047
01:36:47,140 --> 01:36:49,430
从那你可能要在到巴塞罗那的火车上
From there, you'll need to hover on a train to Barcelona,

1048
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:50,970
停留一段时间 知道你能搭上去葡萄牙
where you can get a train to Portugal

1049
01:36:51,060 --> 01:36:52,680
的火车 之后坐船去伦敦
and then a ship to London.

1050
01:36:52,770 --> 01:36:55,780
你现在需要好好休息
Get some rest, you'll need it.

1051
01:37:02,400 --> 01:37:04,030
女士 您好
Hello my madam.

1052
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:30,720
你不要抱怨
No complaining out of you.

1053
01:38:26,990 --> 01:38:28,860
她向南出发了 比利牛斯山脉
She's heading South... Pyrenees.

1054
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:44,200
她试图两次逃跑 已经让她精疲力尽
She's tried to escape twice.

1055
01:39:44,200 --> 01:39:45,940
我们也没法从她身上获得任何信息
We can't get anything out of her.

1056
01:39:50,360 --> 01:39:52,150
下次送她上车
Put her on the next van.

1057
01:41:19,070 --> 01:41:20,080
请进
Yes.

1058
01:41:30,270 --> 01:41:32,130
里欧是对的
Leo was right.

1059
01:41:32,820 --> 01:41:34,090
他们已经掌握了努尔的代码
They must have Noor's code.

1060
01:41:35,380 --> 01:41:35,900
什么
What?

1061
01:41:36,510 --> 01:41:38,840
我们直接把情报人员空投到了
We parachuted those agents straight into

1062
01:41:38,930 --> 01:41:40,930
在盖世太保敌人的手里
the hands of the Gestapo.

1063
01:41:44,810 --> 01:41:46,270
只有飞行员一个人活着回来
The pilot made it back.

1064
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:52,570
我不想就这么放弃
I didn't want to give up on that.

1065
01:41:52,980 --> 01:41:56,350
我不想放弃他们中的任何一个人
I don't want to give up on any of them.

1066
01:41:59,410 --> 01:42:01,630
天呢 我都做了什么
God, what have I done?

1067
01:42:04,190 --> 01:42:07,120
现在说什么都太晚了
It's too goddamn late to ask that now,

1068
01:42:08,220 --> 01:42:11,840
而且他们不是简单的值得我们俩安全的
and they deserve more than the two of us sitting here,

1069
01:42:11,920 --> 01:42:15,710
坐在这里 隐藏在幕后 去猜测
second guessing ourselves, safely tucked away behind a desk.

1070
01:42:15,800 --> 01:42:18,380
但是我们应该为这些做什么呢
But what do we have to show for any of this?

1071
01:42:18,470 --> 01:42:21,680
很快在战场上会有数以万计的侦查人员
We will soon have hundreds of agents in the field.

1072
01:42:21,760 --> 01:42:23,890
是的 我们犯了很多错误 是的
Yes, we've made mistakes, yes,

1073
01:42:23,970 --> 01:42:25,590
有很多事情我们之前就该完成的
things should be done that

1074
01:42:25,590 --> 01:42:26,810
但是我们没有做完
have not yet been accomplished,

1075
01:42:26,890 --> 01:42:29,460
但是我们每天都在进步
but we are getting better at this every day.

1076
01:42:31,640 --> 01:42:35,390
我们没有别的办法 我们只能不断探索
We must keep trying, we must.

1077
01:42:39,440 --> 01:42:40,020
是的
Yes.

1078
01:42:42,100 --> 01:42:43,160
弗吉尼亚那边的情况怎么样了
Have we heard from Virginia?

1079
01:43:03,380 --> 01:43:04,220
该死的
Goddamn it.

1080
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,400
做得好
Well done.

1081
01:44:01,490 --> 01:44:02,570
你做到了
You did it!

1082
01:44:27,470 --> 01:44:29,720
请坐
Please, be seated.

1083
01:44:29,810 --> 01:44:31,180
谢谢
Thank you.

1084
01:44:42,320 --> 01:44:43,280
加了双倍
A double.

1085
01:44:44,660 --> 01:44:45,860
为了卡斯伯特
To Cuthbert.

1086
01:44:45,950 --> 01:44:47,280
为了卡斯伯特
To Cuthbert.

1087
01:44:50,640 --> 01:44:52,450
我觉得我们的所作所为值得钦佩
Who deserves a medal, I think.

1088
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,240
弗吉尼亚 我希望我们有好消息
Virginia, I wish we had better news.

1089
01:45:06,220 --> 01:45:09,100
但是我们得知修道院被突袭了
From what we know the convent was not raided.

1090
01:45:09,180 --> 01:45:12,020
无人生还
Everyone else had or was.

1091
01:45:13,660 --> 01:45:14,480
所有人
Everyone?

1092
01:45:14,560 --> 01:45:16,020
是的
Yes.

1093
01:45:21,400 --> 01:45:27,070
马德琳 她呢 他怎么样
Madeline, how is she?

1094
01:45:27,160 --> 01:45:30,450
她的地下线路也受到了损坏
Her circuit was also a compromised.

1095
01:45:30,530 --> 01:45:32,580
她怎么样了
What happened to her?

1096
01:45:32,660 --> 01:45:35,660
她失踪了
She's missing.

1097
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,090
让我回去
Send me back.

1098
01:45:47,180 --> 01:45:51,390
你是我们最好的之一 我也希望你能回去
You're one of our best, I wish we could.

1099
01:45:51,470 --> 01:45:53,140
你可以下这个命令的
You can.

1100
01:45:53,860 --> 01:45:56,730
盖世太保已经做了他们所有能做的了
The Gestapo are pulling in everything they can.

1101
01:45:56,810 --> 01:45:59,230
现在把像你这么优秀的人才遣返
It would be criminal to send someone

1102
01:45:59,310 --> 01:46:04,650
是一种犯罪行为
as remarkable as you right now.

1103
01:46:04,740 --> 01:46:06,070
他们一直在找你
They're looking for you,

1104
01:46:06,150 --> 01:46:07,700
弗吉尼亚 他们知道你是谁
Virginia, they know who you are.

1105
01:46:07,780 --> 01:46:09,620
我的脑袋挂在我自己脖子上 你知道的
My neck is my own. You know if

1106
01:46:09,700 --> 01:46:11,700
我也愿意为此付出生命 因为这是战争
I'm willing to get a crick in it because there's a war.

1107
01:46:11,780 --> 01:46:15,790
这是你的地下联络网的所有人的生命
It is the necks of everyone in your network.

1108
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:18,420
如果伦敦分部做好了本职工作 保护
Perhaps that wouldn't be the case if F Section

1109
01:46:18,500 --> 01:46:21,210
好侦查人员 这种事情也许就不会发生
did a better job of protecting their agents.

1110
01:46:25,050 --> 01:46:30,140
我们确实尽力做到最好 我们也已经意识
We are doing our best and we are

1111
01:46:30,220 --> 01:46:34,130
到 我们到牺牲很多其他人的生命
all too aware that our best

1112
01:46:34,130 --> 01:46:35,390
去保护最优秀的人
is costing people their lives.

1113
01:46:40,260 --> 01:46:42,440
那是因为太多的地下成员
That's because there are

1114
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:44,150
需要来自无线电台情报员
too many field agents who need to

1115
01:46:44,230 --> 01:46:45,980
的支持
be supported by one wireless.

1116
01:46:46,070 --> 01:46:47,860
一个无线情报员倒下了 所有人消息来源
When one wireless goes down,

1117
01:46:47,950 --> 01:46:50,420
都被摧毁 你需要培训更多的无线情报员
everyone's compromised, you need to train more.

1118
01:46:51,820 --> 01:46:53,700
这是问题的根本所在
That is the problem.

1119
01:46:55,100 --> 01:46:56,340
我们一定会慎重考虑
We will consider that.

1120
01:47:55,390 --> 01:47:57,720
维拉 我们怀疑阿莱切
Vera, we suspect, Aletsche,

1121
01:47:57,810 --> 01:48:02,480
是出卖弗吉尼亚和她的团队的人
is the one who betrayed Virginia's team and

1122
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:05,560
上级领导认为你作为核对他信息的人
upstairs has concerns that

1123
01:48:06,240 --> 01:48:09,570
应该对此事负责
it was you who checked him out?

1124
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:16,060
你知道我们只是检查了他的履历
You know, he checked out on paper.

1125
01:48:17,180 --> 01:48:19,660
是的 是检查了他的履历
He did, yes.

1126
