1
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:26,140
Hey.

2
00:01:26,180 --> 00:01:27,150
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

3
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,440
If you want any tickets,

4
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:29,610
you'll have to go around,

5
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:31,910
uh, to, uh, the front of the,

6
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,940
uh...

7
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:36,080
Oh, well, I suppose
it'll be all right.

8
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:37,680
What the hell am I
doing around here?

9
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:40,620
They walk in here and do
as they damn please.

10
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:48,790
Uh, let's see, uh,
I hope I got...

11
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,390
Three?

12
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:06,510
That'll be seven dollars...

13
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,920
...and 50 cents.

14
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,820
Shh!

15
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,900
Are you Frank?

16
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:07,750
Frank sent us.

17
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,240
Did you bring a horse for me?

18
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,460
Well...

19
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:20,650
Looks like we're...

20
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:25,500
Looks like we're shy one horse.

21
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,700
You brought two too many.

22
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:11,820
Hey, Pa! Look!

23
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,340
That's enough for now.

24
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,140
It's getting late,
come on home.

25
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,210
Boo!

26
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,050
Timmy.

27
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,670
Maureen, look.

28
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:50,380
Mm.

29
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,850
Ah!

30
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,410
Whatcha doin' there?

31
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:30,080
Go inside, quick,
and get washed.

32
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:32,520
And don't touch the
apple pie or the roast.

33
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:35,960
Patrick's already
left for the station, huh?

34
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,290
Oh, he's getting ready, Pa.

35
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:39,520
Damn it, Patrick!

36
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:40,550
Coming, Pa.

37
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,330
Well...

38
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,300
not bad, I'd say.

39
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,660
Bigger them slices,
what the hell.

40
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:51,230
We're throwing
a party, ain't we?

41
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,040
But these are the same
slices as usual.

42
00:17:59,780 --> 00:18:01,610
Yeah, sure.

43
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:03,850
As usual.

44
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,590
Maureen...

45
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,050
soon you can cut the bread

46
00:18:13,090 --> 00:18:16,550
in slices as big as a door
if you want to.

47
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,230
You'll have beautiful
new clothes,

48
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:21,130
and you won't have
to work no more.

49
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:25,130
We going to get rich, Pa?

50
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:32,570
Who knows?

51
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,940
Patrick!

52
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,570
Wait a minute.

53
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,650
Look at the filth on your boots.

54
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,740
Clean 'em.

55
00:18:46,730 --> 00:18:47,780
The train'll come in

56
00:18:47,830 --> 00:18:49,730
and there won't be no
one to meet your mother.

57
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:53,200
Our mother died six years ago.

58
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,070
Go now.
You'll really be late.

59
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,570
Hey, just a minute. Listen, Pa.

60
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:14,380
How am I gonna recognize her?

61
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:16,480
Well, you can't make
no mistake, Patrick.

62
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,680
She's, uh, she's young

63
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,250
and, uh, she's, uh, pretty,

64
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:21,620
and, uh, uh...

65
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,960
she's a lady.

66
00:19:22,990 --> 00:19:24,260
Uh, uh...

67
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:27,820
"For... For-For traveling,
I'll be wearing a black dress

68
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,130
"and the, and the same, uh,

69
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:36,200
straw hat I was wearing...
when we met."

70
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,010
Uh, uh... I'm going to get
some fresh water from the well.

71
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:58,650
Oh, Danny boy, the pipes,
the pipes are callin'...

72
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:10,640
And all the roses fall...

73
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:08,350
Maureen!

74
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,510
What are we gonna do
with this one, Frank?

75
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:36,890
Now that you've
called me by name...

76
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,630
Howdy, George!

77
00:25:03,750 --> 00:25:05,840
Right on time, huh?

78
00:25:10,890 --> 00:25:13,020
That's beyond them tracks.

79
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,990
I saw some mighty
fine stock down South.

80
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,330
Is that so?

81
00:25:22,370 --> 00:25:23,860
And the prices are real good.

82
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,840
Are these your valises, ma'am?

83
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,940
Yes.

84
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:37,950
Come, Sam.

85
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,170
Bring them over to her, Race.

86
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:41,310
We'll tote 'em for you, ma'am.

87
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,650
What have you got?

88
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:05,670
That true,
the sawmill needs hands?

89
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:06,970
Was yesterday.

90
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,370
Why don't you tell your brother?

91
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:09,500
Hiya, Gramps.

92
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:11,100
Hi, Bill.
We're back again.

93
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,700
Come on. Get a move on,
will ya?

94
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:15,310
Ha! Ha!

95
00:26:15,350 --> 00:26:18,580
Get the lead out of your asses,
you red-skinned warriors.

96
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:20,920
I got a whole train
to unload.

97
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,080
All right.

98
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,090
Shut down those
feed sacks first.

99
00:26:24,130 --> 00:26:25,250
Come on.

100
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,390
Come on.

101
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,340
What's your name, and the place
you wanted to go?

102
00:29:17,390 --> 00:29:19,650
Sweetwater.

103
00:29:20,690 --> 00:29:21,780
Hmm?

104
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,620
Brett McBain's farm.

105
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,520
McBain.

106
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,690
Yeah, sure.

107
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:29,790
That stubborn,
redheaded Irishman,

108
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:32,800
killing sand for years
way out there

109
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,630
in the middle of nowhere.

110
00:29:34,670 --> 00:29:36,540
Sweetwater.

111
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,560
Only a loony like him
could call that stinkin'

112
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,230
piece of desert "Sweetwater."

113
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,940
Sweetwater!

114
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,580
Hiya!

115
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:50,550
Sweetwater.

116
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,260
That's right...

117
00:30:34,290 --> 00:30:36,260
a little more to the right.

118
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,460
Higher, higher.

119
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:42,330
Hold it there.

120
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,140
Here they are.

121
00:30:52,180 --> 00:30:54,270
They got here
with their damn rails.

122
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,370
They caught up with us again,
hey, Lafayette?

123
00:30:56,410 --> 00:30:57,810
Let's go!

124
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,580
- Right over.
- Hey, slow down.

125
00:30:59,620 --> 00:31:00,780
What's the matter with you?
Slow down!

126
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:02,840
Hey, boys, watch out...

127
00:31:04,190 --> 00:31:05,280
Watch out down there!

128
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,110
Slow down!

129
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:08,650
Ho!

130
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,450
Why are we stopping?

131
00:32:14,490 --> 00:32:16,010
I told you I was in a hurry.

132
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,320
Don't the train stop?

133
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,360
Yeah.

134
00:34:04,930 --> 00:34:08,360
What can I do for you, ma'am?

135
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:09,950
I would like some water,

136
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,120
if it's no trouble.

137
00:34:11,170 --> 00:34:12,260
Water?!

138
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:14,730
Well, you see,
that word is poison

139
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:15,930
around these parts

140
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:18,130
ever since the days
of the great flood.

141
00:34:18,170 --> 00:34:19,640
You mean you never wash?

142
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,140
We sure do.

143
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:23,140
Well, I'd like
to use the same facilities

144
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,300
you people do.

145
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,640
You sure can.

146
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,150
Just happen to have
a full tub in the back.

147
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,340
And you're lucky.

148
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,620
Only three people have
used it this morning.

149
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:34,480
Used it one at a time
or all together?

150
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:42,750
I can tell you're accustomed
to fine living.

151
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,790
Bet you come
from one of those big

152
00:34:44,830 --> 00:34:46,090
eastern cities.

153
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,760
New Orleans.

154
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:48,930
New Orleans?!

155
00:34:48,970 --> 00:34:50,160
You've been there?

156
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:51,460
No.

157
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,730
But I got a cousin down there.

158
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:53,830
She runs a bar.

159
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:55,370
You know she...

160
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,350
Oh!

161
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,580
Oh.

162
00:36:36,670 --> 00:36:38,430
Jug.

163
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,490
Do you only know how to play,

164
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,890
or do you know how to shoot?

165
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:55,620
You know how
to blow music from that?

166
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,680
Pick it up.

167
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:44,600
You!

168
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,550
You don't know how to play.

169
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,580
Try this one.

170
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,090
Take it.

171
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:57,280
Go on.

172
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,280
Here.

173
00:41:51,070 --> 00:41:52,760
Bravo.

174
00:42:08,050 --> 00:42:09,040
Huh.

175
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,150
Cheyenne.

176
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:20,460
We thought we'd never make it.

177
00:42:20,490 --> 00:42:21,550
It's all right.

178
00:42:21,590 --> 00:42:23,190
You're right on time.

179
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:28,760
To bury my escort.

180
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:31,900
If I'd waited for you,
I'd be in jail by now.

181
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:50,680
Hey.

182
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,090
The gun.

183
00:43:22,290 --> 00:43:25,850
You, uh, interested
in fashions, Harmonica?

184
00:43:32,660 --> 00:43:35,100
I saw three of these
dusters a short time ago.

185
00:43:35,130 --> 00:43:36,720
They were waitin' for a train.

186
00:43:42,010 --> 00:43:46,200
Inside the dusters
there were three men.

187
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:50,150
So?

188
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:54,780
Inside the men
there were three bullets.

189
00:44:04,730 --> 00:44:06,750
That's a crazy story,

190
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,320
Harmonica.

191
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,030
For two reasons.

192
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:15,970
One... nobody around
these parts

193
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,230
got the guts to wear
those dusters,

194
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:19,760
except Cheyenne's men.

195
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:25,970
Two... Cheyenne's men
don't get killed.

196
00:44:28,780 --> 00:44:30,380
That surprise you?

197
00:44:30,420 --> 00:44:32,410
Yeah.

198
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:38,720
Well, you know music...

199
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:39,750
Hmm.

200
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:41,320
And you can count...

201
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:42,620
all the way up to two.

202
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,540
All the way up to six
if I have to.

203
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:56,970
And maybe faster than you.

204
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,760
Yeah, go on.

205
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:14,730
Play, Harmonica.

206
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:17,700
Play, so you can't bullshit.

207
00:45:17,730 --> 00:45:21,960
Only watch those false notes.

208
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:32,570
Like so?

209
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,560
And so this cousin
of mine keeps writing me

210
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:50,790
to come on down to New Orleans.

211
00:45:50,890 --> 00:45:52,660
"Come on down,
help me with the bar.

212
00:45:52,700 --> 00:45:54,790
Make a pile of money."

213
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:57,700
You know, I don't think
I'd get along in a big city.

214
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,220
It's too full of fast men

215
00:45:59,270 --> 00:46:01,670
and loose women...
beggin' your pardon, ma'am.

216
00:46:01,700 --> 00:46:03,030
Oh, no.

217
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:09,200
Now I'm too used to a quiet,
simple country life.

218
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:41,080
He's Timmy.

219
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:43,590
Yes.

220
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,750
Dear God.

221
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,780
On the day...

222
00:48:50,130 --> 00:48:54,090
On the very day
of your wedding.

223
00:48:54,130 --> 00:48:55,690
Poor little miss.

224
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,230
Missus.

225
00:49:00,740 --> 00:49:02,540
Mrs. McBain.

226
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,540
But we all...

227
00:49:03,580 --> 00:49:06,200
Oh, but we thought...

228
00:49:06,250 --> 00:49:07,870
I know.

229
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:11,870
It was to be a surprise today.

230
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,720
Brett McBain and I were married

231
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:17,220
a month ago...

232
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,250
in New Orleans.

233
00:49:35,770 --> 00:49:38,240
I am the resurrection
and the life:

234
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:39,570
He that believeth in me,

235
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:41,580
though he were dead,
yet shall he live:

236
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,270
Whosoever liveth
and believeth in me

237
00:49:44,310 --> 00:49:45,750
shall never die.

238
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:47,310
Amen.

239
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:03,530
Mr. Bennett!

240
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:05,660
What's he doing here?

241
00:50:07,970 --> 00:50:11,630
I found this collar
on a nail by the door.

242
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,550
You got no way of knowing,
but this is as good

243
00:50:18,580 --> 00:50:19,550
as a signature.

244
00:50:19,580 --> 00:50:22,950
Cheyenne's hand.

245
00:50:22,980 --> 00:50:24,950
But why?

246
00:50:24,990 --> 00:50:27,110
Don't worry, Mrs. McBain.

247
00:50:27,160 --> 00:50:29,680
We'll make him tell us
before we hang him.

248
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:33,160
Let's get movin'.

249
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,810
Come on.

250
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,780
Let's go back to Flagstone.

251
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:02,410
No, Sam.

252
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:04,920
You go back.

253
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:08,390
You don't want to
stay out here alone.

254
00:51:09,790 --> 00:51:11,260
Why not?

255
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:13,290
This is my home.

256
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,190
You know, Wobbles...

257
00:55:16,190 --> 00:55:17,820
...I’m kind of mad at you.

258
00:55:21,600 --> 00:55:23,590
Frank wasn't there.

259
00:55:25,470 --> 00:55:27,560
- Ow!
- He sent three friends.

260
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:30,400
I don't know nothin', I swear.

261
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:33,000
I only arranged
the meeting the way...

262
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,570
the way you wanted it.

263
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:38,410
I don't know why
Frank wasn't there.

264
00:55:38,450 --> 00:55:40,210
I swear to you that I...

265
00:55:40,250 --> 00:55:42,910
'Cause he was at the McBains'.

266
00:55:42,950 --> 00:55:44,750
That's not true.

267
00:55:44,790 --> 00:55:46,850
Cheyenne did that job...
everyone knows that.

268
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:48,410
We got proof.

269
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,390
That was always
one of Frank's tricks:

270
00:55:51,430 --> 00:55:53,490
Fakin' evidence.

271
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:58,020
I don't know. I swear.

272
00:55:58,070 --> 00:56:01,630
I-I only arranged the meeting.

273
00:56:01,670 --> 00:56:04,660
I swear I don't know nothin'.

274
00:58:05,390 --> 00:58:08,550
Who's there?

275
01:00:39,800 --> 01:00:41,530
Did you make coffee?

276
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:48,030
Make it.

277
01:00:54,480 --> 01:00:56,710
Didn't sleep a wink.

278
01:00:56,750 --> 01:00:58,720
Pack of turds dressed in black

279
01:00:58,750 --> 01:01:03,210
rode herd on me
the whole damn night.

280
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:07,050
Yeah, but I left 'em
in the middle of the desert.

281
01:01:07,090 --> 01:01:09,960
They're lucky,
they'll be home in three days.

282
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:31,080
I'll do it...

283
01:01:31,110 --> 01:01:34,110
and you fix the coffee.

284
01:01:38,620 --> 01:01:40,420
They want to hang me...

285
01:01:40,460 --> 01:01:44,420
the big black crows.

286
01:01:44,460 --> 01:01:46,760
Idiots.

287
01:01:46,800 --> 01:01:48,590
What the hell?

288
01:01:48,630 --> 01:01:50,260
I'll kill anything...

289
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:52,430
never a kid.

290
01:01:52,470 --> 01:01:55,270
Be like killin' a priest.

291
01:01:55,300 --> 01:01:58,200
A Catholic priest, that is.

292
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,370
Yeah, the world
is full of people

293
01:02:00,410 --> 01:02:02,170
who hate Cheyenne.

294
01:02:17,090 --> 01:02:19,390
You see, I ain't
the mean bastard

295
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:22,420
people make out.

296
01:02:24,430 --> 01:02:27,060
Of course, uh...

297
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:29,860
if somebody had in mind
to kill me...

298
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:33,600
it fires me up...

299
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:38,710
and a fired-up Cheyenne...

300
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:43,070
...ain't a nice thing to see,

301
01:02:43,120 --> 01:02:45,740
especially for a lady.

302
01:02:57,730 --> 01:03:01,060
But you're too smart
to make him mad.

303
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:07,900
So this here's where I was
supposed to do

304
01:03:07,940 --> 01:03:10,410
all the killin', hmm?

305
01:03:12,810 --> 01:03:14,710
Hmm.

306
01:03:14,750 --> 01:03:17,580
Don't seem the place
is worth a shit.

307
01:03:23,250 --> 01:03:28,420
Now... if somebody gets
dressed up to look like me...

308
01:03:31,430 --> 01:03:35,730
so they can hang this thing
around my neck,

309
01:03:35,770 --> 01:03:38,730
I don't like it none,

310
01:03:38,770 --> 01:03:41,760
but I can understand it.

311
01:03:44,610 --> 01:03:48,410
Hmm. What I don't understand

312
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,040
is the why.

313
01:03:51,450 --> 01:03:53,640
Neither do I.

314
01:03:57,550 --> 01:04:01,550
But I see you looked a lot
for the why.

315
01:04:07,730 --> 01:04:08,990
Yeah.

316
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:16,700
What if there were
a whole heap of whys...

317
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:20,870
round, yellow...

318
01:04:20,910 --> 01:04:24,370
you know the kind.

319
01:04:24,410 --> 01:04:27,380
You rap 'em on a stone,

320
01:04:27,410 --> 01:04:29,880
and they go ding.

321
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:31,580
Maybe...

322
01:04:33,420 --> 01:04:37,150
but I didn't find them.

323
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,910
Hmm.

324
01:04:41,590 --> 01:04:43,720
By the way,

325
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,060
do you know anything

326
01:04:45,100 --> 01:04:48,000
about a man going around
playing a harmonica?

327
01:04:50,600 --> 01:04:52,830
He's somebody you'd remember.

328
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:57,670
Instead of talkin', he plays...

329
01:04:57,710 --> 01:05:01,770
and when he'd better play,
he talks.

330
01:05:05,380 --> 01:05:07,350
You know, ma'am,
when you've killed four,

331
01:05:07,390 --> 01:05:09,250
it's easy to make it five.

332
01:05:12,720 --> 01:05:14,190
Sure.

333
01:05:14,220 --> 01:05:16,390
You're an expert.

334
01:05:20,930 --> 01:05:23,800
Ma'am, it seems to me
you ain't caught the idea.

335
01:05:28,410 --> 01:05:31,370
Of course I have.

336
01:05:31,410 --> 01:05:35,370
I'm here alone in the hands
of a bandit who smelled money,

337
01:05:35,410 --> 01:05:37,710
and if you want to,
you can lay me over the table

338
01:05:37,750 --> 01:05:40,040
and amuse yourself,
and even call in

339
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,380
your men. Well...

340
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:44,220
no woman ever died from that.

341
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:46,050
When you're finished,
all I'll need

342
01:05:46,090 --> 01:05:47,720
will be a tub of boiling water,

343
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:50,720
and I'll be exactly
what I was before

344
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:53,390
with just another
filthy memory.

345
01:06:10,540 --> 01:06:13,880
You make good coffee, at least?

346
01:06:14,380 --> 01:06:15,850
Not bad.

347
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:17,680
Congratulations.

348
01:06:17,720 --> 01:06:19,510
Tell me,

349
01:06:19,550 --> 01:06:21,850
was it necessary
that you kill all of them?

350
01:06:21,890 --> 01:06:23,410
I only told you to scare them!

351
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:27,420
People scare better
when they're dyin'.

352
01:06:28,490 --> 01:06:29,690
Then can you tell me

353
01:06:29,730 --> 01:06:33,030
what good
was your stupid massacre?

354
01:06:33,060 --> 01:06:36,360
Now a Mrs. McBain has turned up.

355
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:40,090
So, I didn't expect that.

356
01:06:40,140 --> 01:06:41,700
It happens in business.

357
01:06:41,740 --> 01:06:43,300
Let's say this is...

358
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:45,600
something we didn't plan on.

359
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:50,050
I have no time
for surprises, Frank.

360
01:06:50,080 --> 01:06:52,880
You know that.

361
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:57,150
I got on board
in sight of the Atlantic,

362
01:06:57,190 --> 01:07:00,650
and before my eyes rot,

363
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:03,490
I want to see the blue
of the Pacific

364
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:06,320
outside that window.

365
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,560
I know where you got on board.

366
01:07:08,600 --> 01:07:12,330
I was there, too, remember?

367
01:07:15,770 --> 01:07:17,070
To, um...

368
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:22,340
...remove small obstacles
from the track, you said.

369
01:07:22,380 --> 01:07:25,210
Well, there were a few...

370
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:32,510
...but we traveled a long way
just the same,

371
01:07:32,550 --> 01:07:34,080
and fast.

372
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:36,610
Even tuberculosis of the bones

373
01:07:36,660 --> 01:07:38,650
travels fast.

374
01:07:40,230 --> 01:07:44,360
Don't play the sick man
with me, Mr. Morton.

375
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:47,390
I knew you when you were
just barely limping.

376
01:07:50,240 --> 01:07:54,230
I watched that dry rot
rise a little more every day.

377
01:07:56,340 --> 01:07:59,740
Any normal man'd
put a bullet in his brain,

378
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:04,650
but you... you just...
got a little more hasty.

379
01:08:04,680 --> 01:08:06,810
Otherwise,
you ain't changed any.

380
01:08:06,850 --> 01:08:09,150
I'd say you've changed, Frank...

381
01:08:09,190 --> 01:08:11,320
a lot.

382
01:08:11,360 --> 01:08:16,020
You used to take care
of certain things personally.

383
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:18,660
Now...

384
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:20,490
you're keeping
in the background.

385
01:08:22,030 --> 01:08:25,990
You'll end up giving orders.

386
01:08:26,040 --> 01:08:30,030
It's because now I don't want
to leave you alone too much.

387
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:35,010
You're going to need somebody
more and more every day

388
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,140
to stay near you...

389
01:08:36,180 --> 01:08:39,810
- like a friend.
- Or like a partner.

390
01:08:39,850 --> 01:08:42,480
Hmm?

391
01:08:49,730 --> 01:08:52,460
How does it feel sitting behind
that desk, Frank?

392
01:08:56,670 --> 01:08:59,660
It's almost
like holdin' a gun...

393
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:07,270
only much more powerful.

394
01:09:21,860 --> 01:09:23,980
You see,

395
01:09:24,030 --> 01:09:26,790
staying with you, uh...

396
01:09:27,830 --> 01:09:31,960
I'm beginning to think big, too.

397
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:37,330
This McBain business

398
01:09:37,370 --> 01:09:41,330
is giving me ideas.

399
01:09:46,050 --> 01:09:47,670
I'm sorry for you,

400
01:09:47,780 --> 01:09:48,680
Frank.

401
01:09:48,780 --> 01:09:50,510
You're doing your best.

402
01:09:51,890 --> 01:09:55,010
You'll never succeed
in becoming like me.

403
01:09:57,720 --> 01:10:00,160
- Why?
- Because...

404
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:03,690
there are many things
you'll never understand.

405
01:10:15,740 --> 01:10:17,540
This is one of them.

406
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:19,370
You see, Frank,

407
01:10:19,410 --> 01:10:22,280
there are many kinds
of weapons,

408
01:10:22,310 --> 01:10:25,370
and the only one
that can stop that

409
01:10:25,420 --> 01:10:27,440
is this.

410
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,270
Now, shall we get back

411
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,740
to our little problem?

412
01:11:26,070 --> 01:11:30,700
My weapons might look simple
to you, Mr. Morton,

413
01:11:30,750 --> 01:11:32,870
but they can still shoot holes

414
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:36,040
big enough
for our little problems.

415
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:41,250
Pretty soon, the widow McBain
won't be a problem no more.

416
01:11:41,360 --> 01:11:44,950
You wake up one morning and say,
"World, I know you.

417
01:11:44,990 --> 01:11:48,020
From now on,
there are no more surprises,"

418
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:51,500
and then you happen
to meet a man like this

419
01:11:51,530 --> 01:11:52,900
who looked like a good man...

420
01:11:52,930 --> 01:11:56,230
clear eyes, strong hands...

421
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:57,900
and he wants to marry you...

422
01:11:57,940 --> 01:11:59,500
which doesn't happen often,

423
01:11:59,540 --> 01:12:01,840
and he says he's rich, too,

424
01:12:01,880 --> 01:12:03,270
which doesn't hurt.

425
01:12:06,380 --> 01:12:10,210
So you think,
"To hell with New Orleans.

426
01:12:10,250 --> 01:12:13,340
"Now I'll say yes
and go live in the country.

427
01:12:15,250 --> 01:12:19,690
"I wouldn't mind giving him
a half a dozen kids after all...

428
01:12:19,760 --> 01:12:23,420
take care of a house,
do something... what the hell?"

429
01:12:35,470 --> 01:12:38,700
Well, God rest your soul,
Brett McBain...

430
01:12:38,810 --> 01:12:40,970
even if he's going
to have a job

431
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:44,040
pulling you out
of the devil's grip.

432
01:12:57,690 --> 01:13:01,820
Still, I swear he left money
around someplace.

433
01:13:01,870 --> 01:13:06,500
If you can find it,
you're welcome to it.

434
01:13:06,540 --> 01:13:09,230
Mrs. McBain goes
back to civilization

435
01:13:09,270 --> 01:13:13,040
minus a husband,
and plus a great future.

436
01:13:15,210 --> 01:13:17,700
Hmm.

437
01:13:25,390 --> 01:13:27,410
You deserve better.

438
01:13:29,790 --> 01:13:31,690
The last man who told me that

439
01:13:31,790 --> 01:13:33,820
is buried out there.

440
01:13:43,770 --> 01:13:46,260
You know, Jill,
you remind me of my mother.

441
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:53,110
She was the biggest whore
in Alameda,

442
01:13:53,150 --> 01:13:54,270
and the finest woman

443
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,150
that ever lived.

444
01:13:56,180 --> 01:13:58,910
Whoever my father
was, for an hour

445
01:13:58,950 --> 01:14:03,650
or for a month...
he must've been a happy man.

446
01:14:14,300 --> 01:14:18,330
Hey. Hey! Ha, Ha!

447
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:20,170
Hey!

448
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:27,400
What do you want?

449
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:29,800
Cheyenne's right.

450
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:34,210
Once you've killed four,
it's easy to make it five.

451
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:50,720
This isn't the time to leave.

452
01:16:52,620 --> 01:16:54,170
Get me some water.

453
01:17:03,730 --> 01:17:06,920
From the well.

454
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:09,260
I like my water fresh.

455
01:18:36,150 --> 01:18:39,050
When you hear a strange sound,
drop to the ground.

456
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:41,640
A sound?

457
01:18:41,690 --> 01:18:42,780
Like what?

458
01:18:42,820 --> 01:18:44,980
Like that.

459
01:19:16,120 --> 01:19:18,610
He not only plays...

460
01:19:18,650 --> 01:19:21,520
he can shoot, too.

461
01:19:54,440 --> 01:19:56,100
Good morning, Mrs. McBain.

462
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:57,800
- What brings you to town?
- Good morning.

463
01:19:58,940 --> 01:20:00,240
Maybe you don't remember,

464
01:20:00,280 --> 01:20:02,010
but yesterday
at the funeral I...

465
01:20:02,050 --> 01:20:04,310
I remember very well.

466
01:20:04,350 --> 01:20:08,290
Is there something
I can do for you?

467
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:10,310
Yes.

468
01:20:12,090 --> 01:20:15,080
See Frank...
and tell him I know everything.

469
01:20:15,130 --> 01:20:16,420
Why is everybody

470
01:20:16,460 --> 01:20:18,730
hounding me
about this guy Frank?

471
01:20:18,770 --> 01:20:20,460
I don't know him.

472
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,660
I never heard of him.

473
01:20:21,700 --> 01:20:22,670
I got my own worries

474
01:20:22,700 --> 01:20:24,100
and all I want is
to be left in peace.

475
01:20:24,140 --> 01:20:27,870
Tell Frank I want
to negotiate with him...

476
01:20:27,910 --> 01:20:29,380
personally!

477
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:25,560
You were told
not to come here

478
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:27,900
for any reason.

479
01:21:27,940 --> 01:21:29,770
Whatever business you have
with Frank,

480
01:21:29,810 --> 01:21:31,140
keep it far away from here.

481
01:21:31,180 --> 01:21:32,400
Yes, I-I know, Mr. Morton,

482
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:33,410
but when I heard

483
01:21:33,440 --> 01:21:34,780
that woman say
she knew everything,

484
01:21:34,810 --> 01:21:36,540
I thought that
the important thing was for me

485
01:21:36,580 --> 01:21:38,570
to come over here right away
and tell you about it.

486
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,740
You never thought
it wasn't a trick?

487
01:21:40,780 --> 01:21:43,250
Sure, but you know that
I'm mighty careful, Frank.

488
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:45,450
No one could've followed me.

489
01:21:45,490 --> 01:21:47,620
That's the first thing I learned
working for you:

490
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:51,120
To listen unseen,
and to watch unheard.

491
01:21:51,160 --> 01:21:53,150
Hmm, you should learn to live

492
01:21:53,270 --> 01:21:54,530
as if you didn't exist.

493
01:21:55,800 --> 01:21:58,060
You-You've known me
a long time, Frank.

494
01:21:58,100 --> 01:21:59,370
You know you can
trust me.

495
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:01,900
Wobbles...

496
01:22:05,380 --> 01:22:07,240
how can you trust a man

497
01:22:07,280 --> 01:22:10,650
that wears both a belt
and suspenders...

498
01:22:10,680 --> 01:22:13,380
a man can't even
trust his own pants?

499
01:22:23,130 --> 01:22:25,500
Let's get out of here.

500
01:24:04,500 --> 01:24:06,840
The end of the line.

501
01:24:08,970 --> 01:24:10,910
Yeah.

502
01:24:16,850 --> 01:24:18,280
Get him on board.

503
01:24:32,470 --> 01:24:33,520
Tie him up.

504
01:25:08,540 --> 01:25:09,600
Wait, Frank...

505
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:11,470
I...

506
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:13,740
So nobody followed you.

507
01:25:13,780 --> 01:25:16,610
No... you gotta believe me.

508
01:25:16,650 --> 01:25:18,510
So this is the way

509
01:25:18,550 --> 01:25:19,810
I can trust you.

510
01:25:19,850 --> 01:25:21,110
I can explain.

511
01:25:21,220 --> 01:25:23,340
I didn't know that he...

512
01:25:23,390 --> 01:25:24,720
Get out.

513
01:25:24,750 --> 01:25:26,750
No, no... no, Frank...

514
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:28,190
Get out!

515
01:25:43,070 --> 01:25:44,060
Shh.

516
01:25:48,180 --> 01:25:49,200
Frank, wait...

517
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,000
I told you to keep quiet.

518
01:26:18,610 --> 01:26:20,010
Where are Logan and Jim,

519
01:26:20,050 --> 01:26:21,710
they take care of the woman?

520
01:26:21,750 --> 01:26:23,880
Someone took care of them.

521
01:26:23,920 --> 01:26:26,110
We found them out
at McBain's place.

522
01:26:26,220 --> 01:26:27,120
Stone dead.

523
01:26:27,220 --> 01:26:29,850
And the woman was gone.

524
01:26:29,890 --> 01:26:31,950
Your friends have
a high mortality rate,

525
01:26:31,990 --> 01:26:34,080
Frank.

526
01:26:44,970 --> 01:26:47,130
First three, then two.

527
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:02,410
So you're the one
who makes appointments.

528
01:27:04,190 --> 01:27:07,630
And you're the one
who doesn't keep 'em.

529
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:11,630
What do you want?

530
01:27:11,670 --> 01:27:13,000
Who are you?

531
01:27:16,610 --> 01:27:18,130
Dave Jenkins.

532
01:27:25,920 --> 01:27:28,940
Dave Jenkins is dead
a long time ago.

533
01:27:28,990 --> 01:27:32,080
Calder Benson.

534
01:27:33,760 --> 01:27:36,350
What's your name?
Benson's dead, too.

535
01:27:36,390 --> 01:27:40,420
You ought to know, Frank,
better than anyone.

536
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:41,990
You killed them.

537
01:27:42,030 --> 01:27:43,590
Who are you?

538
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:44,330
Who are you?!

539
01:27:44,370 --> 01:27:45,930
Frank!

540
01:27:47,300 --> 01:27:49,640
The woman.

541
01:27:52,010 --> 01:27:53,910
We're only losing time.

542
01:27:58,780 --> 01:28:01,180
All right.

543
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:03,550
This time I'll take care
of her personally.

544
01:28:03,590 --> 01:28:06,650
Yeah, it ought
to be easy for you.

545
01:28:11,100 --> 01:28:13,360
Keep him warm for me.

546
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,330
If he gives you
any trouble, hit him.

547
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:18,960
Not in the mouth...
he's gotta talk...

548
01:28:19,000 --> 01:28:20,200
and plenty.

549
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:27,550
Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

550
01:28:27,580 --> 01:28:30,020
By the way, I want you
to keep an eye on that cripple

551
01:28:30,050 --> 01:28:31,240
all the time, understand?

552
01:28:31,280 --> 01:28:32,340
Sure, Frank.

553
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:06,550
See anyone?

554
01:30:06,590 --> 01:30:08,710
No.

555
01:30:28,070 --> 01:30:28,940
There he is!

556
01:33:12,450 --> 01:33:15,610
You only know how to shoot?

557
01:33:16,990 --> 01:33:19,720
Or do you know how to cut, too?

558
01:33:29,670 --> 01:33:31,530
Hey, you.

559
01:33:33,340 --> 01:33:35,960
Wait a minute.

560
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:39,340
Let's have a good look at you.

561
01:33:49,590 --> 01:33:50,610
Hey...

562
01:33:50,650 --> 01:33:52,090
Mr. Choo-Choo.

563
01:34:11,440 --> 01:34:13,970
It's easy to find you...

564
01:34:14,010 --> 01:34:15,140
bastard.

565
01:34:15,180 --> 01:34:17,840
I don't have to kill you now.

566
01:34:17,880 --> 01:34:20,080
You leave a slime
behind you like a snail...

567
01:34:20,120 --> 01:34:24,890
two beautiful shiny rails.

568
01:34:24,920 --> 01:34:26,480
There's another bastard,

569
01:34:26,530 --> 01:34:29,360
and he's getting
further away every minute.

570
01:34:41,680 --> 01:34:43,610
There it is...

571
01:34:43,640 --> 01:34:45,410
exactly what your
husband ordered from me.

572
01:34:45,450 --> 01:34:47,570
And seeing as how he paid
cash on the barrelhead,

573
01:34:47,620 --> 01:34:49,710
it all belongs to you.

574
01:34:49,750 --> 01:34:54,350
Oak planks, beach, pine,
all first-grade lumber.

575
01:34:54,390 --> 01:34:58,790
And there's beams and foundation
pilings, ten kegs of nails,

576
01:34:58,830 --> 01:35:02,490
20 barrels of tar
and all these tools.

577
01:35:02,530 --> 01:35:04,590
Maybe he wanted to enlarge
the farmhouse.

578
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:07,100
Enlarge the farmhouse?

579
01:35:07,140 --> 01:35:09,430
He could've built
at least eight of them.

580
01:35:09,470 --> 01:35:11,910
By the way, ma'am,

581
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:14,070
McBain also ordered this.

582
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:15,340
Said it was important.

583
01:35:15,380 --> 01:35:17,540
Only... only seems he forgot

584
01:35:17,580 --> 01:35:19,340
to tell me what he wanted
printed on it.

585
01:35:27,260 --> 01:35:29,020
Station.

586
01:35:29,060 --> 01:35:31,150
How's that again?

587
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:33,990
I said print "Station."

588
01:36:05,900 --> 01:36:07,920
Lookin' for this?

589
01:36:07,970 --> 01:36:11,530
I've had enough
of your butcher tactics.

590
01:36:11,570 --> 01:36:13,800
I know that woman is here.

591
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,870
I don't want any more
useless killings.

592
01:36:16,910 --> 01:36:20,040
I'm ready to make
a deal for that land...

593
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:22,100
to pay what's necessary.

594
01:36:22,150 --> 01:36:25,850
I don't want to waste
any more time.

595
01:36:25,890 --> 01:36:28,910
You made a big mistake, Morton.

596
01:36:31,590 --> 01:36:33,290
When you're not on that train,

597
01:36:33,330 --> 01:36:35,730
you look like a turtle
out of its shell.

598
01:36:35,760 --> 01:36:38,390
Just funny.

599
01:36:38,430 --> 01:36:39,900
Poor cripple... talking big

600
01:36:39,930 --> 01:36:42,900
so nobody will know how scared
you are.

601
01:36:42,940 --> 01:36:44,670
I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

602
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:49,410
I don't have time
to compete with you.

603
01:36:55,520 --> 01:36:57,380
Compete?

604
01:37:00,290 --> 01:37:03,120
Why you...

605
01:37:03,160 --> 01:37:04,320
You can't even stand

606
01:37:04,360 --> 01:37:06,090
on your own feet by yourself.

607
01:37:16,510 --> 01:37:19,670
Is that sufficient
to make you feel strong?

608
01:37:19,710 --> 01:37:23,200
I could squash you
like a wormy apple.

609
01:37:25,650 --> 01:37:29,140
Sure...
but you won't do it,

610
01:37:29,250 --> 01:37:33,690
because it's not to...
your advantage.

611
01:37:36,330 --> 01:37:38,020
Hmm.

612
01:37:39,360 --> 01:37:43,130
Who knows how far you'd have
gone with two good legs, huh?

613
01:37:50,270 --> 01:37:52,330
Help him back to the train.

614
01:37:52,380 --> 01:37:54,040
Keep your eye on him.

615
01:37:55,880 --> 01:38:00,110
Oh, Morton, don't worry
about the land.

616
01:38:00,220 --> 01:38:02,980
If you feel like paying for it,
you can pay, of course.

617
01:38:03,020 --> 01:38:04,210
Won't make any difference
to you,

618
01:38:04,260 --> 01:38:06,620
dealing with a new owner.

619
01:38:33,150 --> 01:38:34,680
Cheyenne.

620
01:38:34,720 --> 01:38:38,020
Hey, Cheyenne, there's
a square staked out here.

621
01:38:38,060 --> 01:38:39,890
It says "Water Tank."

622
01:38:39,930 --> 01:38:41,360
Over here, too.

623
01:38:41,390 --> 01:38:43,490
Only it says "Post Office."

624
01:38:43,530 --> 01:38:46,260
And this one says "Corral."

625
01:38:46,300 --> 01:38:48,730
And this here "Church."

626
01:38:48,770 --> 01:38:51,290
What the hell is this?

627
01:38:51,340 --> 01:38:52,860
Can't you see?

628
01:38:52,910 --> 01:38:55,500
It's a station...

629
01:38:55,540 --> 01:38:59,740
and all around it, a town.

630
01:39:01,050 --> 01:39:03,880
It's Brett McBain's town.

631
01:39:06,450 --> 01:39:08,850
Was he crazy.

632
01:39:08,890 --> 01:39:10,980
Yeah, in a very special way.

633
01:39:12,630 --> 01:39:15,150
An Irishman.

634
01:39:16,160 --> 01:39:17,360
He knew sooner or later,

635
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:19,330
that railroad coming
through Flagstone

636
01:39:19,370 --> 01:39:21,800
would continue on West.

637
01:39:21,840 --> 01:39:24,770
So he looked over all
this country out here...

638
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:27,440
until he found this
hunk of desert.

639
01:39:27,480 --> 01:39:29,880
Nobody wanted it.

640
01:39:33,650 --> 01:39:35,310
But he bought it.

641
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:40,690
Then he tightened his belt,

642
01:39:40,720 --> 01:39:44,250
and for years he waited.

643
01:39:44,290 --> 01:39:46,160
Waited for what?

644
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:50,000
For the railroad
to reach this point.

645
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:52,800
Aw, but how in the hell
could he be sure

646
01:39:52,840 --> 01:39:55,960
the railroad would pass
through his property?

647
01:39:56,010 --> 01:40:00,600
Them steam engines can't
roll without water,

648
01:40:00,650 --> 01:40:02,170
and the only water
for 50 miles

649
01:40:02,250 --> 01:40:04,010
west of Flagstone is right here,

650
01:40:04,050 --> 01:40:06,410
under this land.

651
01:40:06,450 --> 01:40:08,510
Aha.

652
01:40:08,550 --> 01:40:10,220
He was no fool,
our dead friend, huh?

653
01:40:11,620 --> 01:40:13,990
He was going to sell
this piece of desert

654
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:16,460
for its weight in gold,
wasn't he?

655
01:40:16,500 --> 01:40:17,660
You don't sell

656
01:40:17,700 --> 01:40:20,960
the dream of a lifetime.

657
01:40:21,000 --> 01:40:23,370
Brett McBain wanted
his station.

658
01:40:25,970 --> 01:40:28,600
He got the rights
to build it.

659
01:40:30,680 --> 01:40:32,510
How do you know all this?

660
01:40:32,550 --> 01:40:34,210
I saw a document.

661
01:40:34,310 --> 01:40:35,580
It was all in order...

662
01:40:35,620 --> 01:40:37,080
seals, signatures, everything.

663
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:40,640
One thing though...
in very small print,

664
01:40:40,690 --> 01:40:44,020
there is a short clause

665
01:40:44,060 --> 01:40:48,120
which says that McBain
or his heirs lose all rights

666
01:40:48,160 --> 01:40:52,150
if by the time the railroad
reaches this point...

667
01:40:52,200 --> 01:40:55,130
the station ain't built yet.

668
01:40:55,170 --> 01:40:57,000
Aha.

669
01:41:02,010 --> 01:41:03,500
Speaking of railroads,

670
01:41:03,540 --> 01:41:05,940
I notice the rail gang's
already...

671
01:41:05,980 --> 01:41:07,640
Hey.

672
01:41:10,150 --> 01:41:13,590
I noticed the rail gang's
already behind those hills,

673
01:41:13,620 --> 01:41:15,750
and before you know it,

674
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:18,520
they're gonna be here.

675
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:19,930
Yeah.

676
01:41:19,960 --> 01:41:22,800
Yeah.

677
01:41:22,830 --> 01:41:24,800
Listen...

678
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:30,430
Harmonica, a town built
around a railroad...

679
01:41:32,240 --> 01:41:35,640
You could make a fortune, huh?

680
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:39,310
Hundreds of thousands
of dollars.

681
01:41:39,350 --> 01:41:42,010
Hey, more than that.

682
01:41:42,050 --> 01:41:44,850
Thousands of thousands.

683
01:41:44,890 --> 01:41:47,320
They call them millions.

684
01:41:48,790 --> 01:41:53,060
Millions.

685
01:41:53,100 --> 01:41:56,460
Yeah, millions.

686
01:41:56,500 --> 01:41:59,370
I always thought it'd
be easy to make a deal

687
01:41:59,400 --> 01:42:02,170
with a smart lady.

688
01:42:02,240 --> 01:42:03,830
All you gotta do is...

689
01:42:05,940 --> 01:42:09,400
Hey, what in the hell
are you standing around for?!

690
01:42:09,450 --> 01:42:12,710
But, Chief, what are
we supposed to do?

691
01:42:12,750 --> 01:42:14,690
What are you supposed to do?

692
01:42:14,720 --> 01:42:17,620
Build a station, idiots!

693
01:42:19,090 --> 01:42:22,420
Figure it ain't gonna
look like much...

694
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:28,590
but it'll be the first thing
she sees

695
01:42:28,630 --> 01:42:30,690
when she gets back.

696
01:42:30,740 --> 01:42:34,070
If she gets back.

697
01:43:52,560 --> 01:43:54,580
I think...

698
01:44:03,230 --> 01:44:05,900
Yeah.

699
01:44:05,940 --> 01:44:08,030
I'm beginning to think
I might be

700
01:44:08,070 --> 01:44:09,870
a little sorry killing you.

701
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:14,710
You like being alive...

702
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,800
hmm?

703
01:44:27,530 --> 01:44:31,690
And you also like to feel
a man's hands all over you.

704
01:44:32,830 --> 01:44:35,930
You like it.

705
01:44:37,770 --> 01:44:39,600
Even if they're the hands
of the man

706
01:44:39,640 --> 01:44:40,970
who killed your husband.

707
01:45:02,430 --> 01:45:03,920
What a...

708
01:45:07,300 --> 01:45:09,740
What a little tramp.

709
01:45:12,240 --> 01:45:14,540
Is there anything in the world
you wouldn't do

710
01:45:14,580 --> 01:45:16,910
to save your skin?

711
01:45:19,710 --> 01:45:22,340
Nothing, Frank.

712
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:48,600
Mmm... now I understand
why they miss you so much

713
01:45:48,640 --> 01:45:53,810
down there in...
New Orleans.

714
01:45:56,190 --> 01:45:58,620
Great invention...
the telegraph.

715
01:45:58,660 --> 01:46:00,020
Dit-dit, dit-dah,

716
01:46:00,060 --> 01:46:03,150
dit-dit-dit, dit-dah, dit-dit...

717
01:46:03,190 --> 01:46:06,420
Jill... the brunette?

718
01:46:06,460 --> 01:46:08,120
My God, all the customers

719
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:10,760
of the most elegant whorehouse
on Bourbon Street

720
01:46:10,800 --> 01:46:13,200
have been weeping
ever since she left.

721
01:46:15,570 --> 01:46:19,170
Say, tell me...

722
01:46:19,210 --> 01:46:22,040
did old McBain know?

723
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,940
Yeah.

724
01:46:23,980 --> 01:46:26,680
Yeah, I bet he did.

725
01:46:26,720 --> 01:46:29,210
He's just the type
to marry a whore.

726
01:46:32,190 --> 01:46:35,420
Hey...

727
01:46:35,460 --> 01:46:39,300
that's an idea.

728
01:46:39,330 --> 01:46:41,800
I could marry you,

729
01:46:41,830 --> 01:46:45,290
and the land'd become mine.

730
01:46:45,340 --> 01:46:46,930
And maybe...

731
01:46:48,680 --> 01:46:51,870
you'd make a perfect wife.

732
01:46:56,480 --> 01:47:00,150
It'd be me wouldn't be
any good as a husband.

733
01:47:00,250 --> 01:47:03,310
Too bad.

734
01:47:03,360 --> 01:47:06,490
We'll have to think
of another solution.

735
01:47:06,530 --> 01:47:08,790
Simpler.

736
01:47:12,930 --> 01:47:14,920
Quicker.

737
01:47:36,490 --> 01:47:39,090
As sheriff of this county

738
01:47:39,130 --> 01:47:42,330
I've been asked to preside
over the sale by auction

739
01:47:42,370 --> 01:47:44,730
of all property belonging

740
01:47:44,770 --> 01:47:47,600
to Mrs. Jill McBain,
here present.

741
01:47:47,640 --> 01:47:50,900
This parcel of land
measures 320 acres.

742
01:47:50,940 --> 01:47:55,640
It's free of all encumbrances,
liens and mortgages.

743
01:47:55,680 --> 01:47:58,650
This property
and all it contains...

744
01:47:58,680 --> 01:48:00,340
lock, stock and barrel...

745
01:48:00,380 --> 01:48:03,250
will be turned over
to the lucky purchaser

746
01:48:03,290 --> 01:48:04,910
at the time of sale.

747
01:48:04,960 --> 01:48:06,350
All the contents therein

748
01:48:06,390 --> 01:48:08,980
are listed by number
on the inventory sheet

749
01:48:09,030 --> 01:48:10,390
distributed among you.

750
01:48:10,430 --> 01:48:14,420
The entire property will be sold
in block to the highest bidder.

751
01:48:14,470 --> 01:48:16,130
All right,
that's clear to everybody.

752
01:48:16,170 --> 01:48:19,660
I declare the auction open.

753
01:48:19,700 --> 01:48:22,300
Now who's going
to make the first bid?

754
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:35,610
All right, now who's
going to make the first bid?

755
01:48:39,560 --> 01:48:42,650
Two hundred dollars!

756
01:48:42,700 --> 01:48:45,190
Well, I have an opening
bid of $200.

757
01:48:45,300 --> 01:48:47,130
Two hundred dollars.

758
01:48:47,170 --> 01:48:49,660
Do I hear more?

759
01:48:49,700 --> 01:48:53,760
That stinkin' piece of land
ain't worth it, old timer.

760
01:48:53,810 --> 01:48:55,540
Well, come on,
my friends. $200?

761
01:48:56,740 --> 01:48:59,910
The livestock alone
is worth twice that much.

762
01:48:59,950 --> 01:49:02,780
Well...

763
01:49:02,820 --> 01:49:06,340
Who's going to bid $300?

764
01:49:10,190 --> 01:49:11,720
Now look, friends,

765
01:49:11,760 --> 01:49:15,630
I realize we're not
offering California here,

766
01:49:15,660 --> 01:49:18,630
but $200 is damn little
for all that property.

767
01:49:18,670 --> 01:49:19,860
Ladies and gentlemen,

768
01:49:19,900 --> 01:49:22,160
I wouldn't even take
$200 as a deposit.

769
01:49:25,810 --> 01:49:29,240
Well, nobody's going to bid
it up.

770
01:49:35,780 --> 01:49:40,690
You sure you wouldn't want
to set a minimum price?

771
01:49:42,490 --> 01:49:44,690
I wish I were wrong,
Mrs. McBain,

772
01:49:44,730 --> 01:49:46,160
but you're liable
to end up

773
01:49:46,200 --> 01:49:48,260
selling the place
for a plate of beans.

774
01:49:55,010 --> 01:49:58,130
All I want is to sell.

775
01:51:04,550 --> 01:51:05,770
He looks sad, huh?

776
01:51:05,810 --> 01:51:08,010
If you say so.

777
01:51:08,050 --> 01:51:09,180
How many?

778
01:51:09,220 --> 01:51:10,340
One card.

779
01:51:12,390 --> 01:51:14,790
And one for me.

780
01:51:16,590 --> 01:51:18,580
Dealer takes three.

781
01:51:29,370 --> 01:51:31,860
Can I... can I take a hand?

782
01:51:37,650 --> 01:51:39,310
Fifteen.

783
01:51:52,260 --> 01:51:54,250
Yeah, sit down.

784
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,990
I'll deal.

785
01:54:04,600 --> 01:54:07,660
How do you, uh...

786
01:54:07,700 --> 01:54:10,870
how do you play this game,
Mr. Morton?

787
01:54:12,510 --> 01:54:15,950
It's very simple.

788
01:54:15,980 --> 01:54:19,110
As long as you use your head,

789
01:54:19,150 --> 01:54:21,480
you never lose.

790
01:54:21,590 --> 01:54:23,490
Five hundred dollars.

791
01:54:27,290 --> 01:54:29,020
Hmm.

792
01:54:29,060 --> 01:54:30,530
Five hundred dollars.

793
01:54:30,560 --> 01:54:32,190
Mm-hmm.

794
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:34,600
Do I hear any other bids?

795
01:54:36,370 --> 01:54:39,000
I don't think so.

796
01:54:47,380 --> 01:54:50,410
I'm sorry, Mrs. McBain, but...

797
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:54,390
I think I'm gonna have to knock
down on that last bid.

798
01:55:05,270 --> 01:55:07,170
Five hundred, once...

799
01:55:10,200 --> 01:55:12,800
Five hundred dollars, twice...

800
01:55:14,980 --> 01:55:16,270
Five hundred dollars...

801
01:55:16,310 --> 01:55:18,070
Five thousand dollars.

802
01:55:41,770 --> 01:55:44,210
You said $5,000?

803
01:55:44,270 --> 01:55:47,370
It's on its way.

804
01:55:59,220 --> 01:56:01,120
- That's Cheyenne.
- It's Cheyenne.

805
01:56:10,330 --> 01:56:14,000
The reward for this man
is $5,000, that right?

806
01:56:14,040 --> 01:56:18,600
Judas was content
with $4,970 less.

807
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:22,340
There were no dollars
in them days.

808
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:26,280
Mm. But sons of bitches, yeah.

809
01:56:39,230 --> 01:56:42,560
Hey, wait a minute.

810
01:56:44,070 --> 01:56:45,540
The jail's that way.

811
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:47,130
Yeah, I know.

812
01:56:47,170 --> 01:56:51,440
Yeah, but, uh, you're going
to the railroad station.

813
01:56:51,480 --> 01:56:54,210
I'm sending you
to Yuma, Cheyenne.

814
01:56:54,280 --> 01:56:56,650
They got a modern jail there.

815
01:56:56,680 --> 01:56:59,740
It's got more walls,
more bars...

816
01:56:59,790 --> 01:57:01,810
more guards.

817
01:57:01,860 --> 01:57:04,550
Oh, you'll like it...
in 20 years.

818
01:57:04,590 --> 01:57:06,490
You'll see.

819
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:32,650
Whoa! Hey-hey!

820
01:58:07,060 --> 01:58:09,250
Two tickets, amigo,

821
01:58:09,290 --> 01:58:10,850
to the next station.

822
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:13,160
One-way only.

823
01:58:13,200 --> 01:58:14,630
Mm.

824
01:58:14,660 --> 01:58:18,260
Here's to you,
and congratulations.

825
01:58:22,540 --> 01:58:26,270
You've got yourself
a good deal.

826
01:58:26,310 --> 01:58:28,110
Oh, the auction.

827
01:58:28,140 --> 01:58:30,480
Forget it.

828
01:58:30,510 --> 01:58:32,510
I don't invest in land.

829
01:58:34,290 --> 01:58:36,910
You don't look at all
like the noble defender

830
01:58:36,950 --> 01:58:39,150
of poor, defenseless widows.

831
01:58:41,130 --> 01:58:43,320
But then again...

832
01:58:45,330 --> 01:58:49,230
I don't look like
a poor, defenseless widow.

833
01:58:55,470 --> 01:58:58,070
Cheyenne's right...
you're a remarkable woman.

834
01:58:59,150 --> 01:59:02,640
And you're a remarkable man...

835
01:59:02,680 --> 01:59:05,050
but you have something
on your mind.

836
01:59:11,220 --> 01:59:13,450
And you've got something
on your mind.

837
01:59:16,900 --> 01:59:18,990
Hot water.

838
01:59:19,030 --> 01:59:21,090
A bathtub full of hot water.

839
01:59:39,090 --> 01:59:42,610
I think it's time
I filled that bathtub.

840
02:00:13,260 --> 02:00:14,690
Who are you?

841
02:00:36,110 --> 02:00:38,480
Jim Cooper.

842
02:00:38,520 --> 02:00:41,250
Chuck Youngblood.

843
02:00:41,290 --> 02:00:43,480
More dead men.

844
02:00:46,490 --> 02:00:49,650
They were all alive until
they met you, Frank.

845
02:00:55,770 --> 02:00:59,670
You paid $5,000 for
somethin' belongs to me.

846
02:01:03,510 --> 02:01:06,030
Five thousand...

847
02:01:10,580 --> 02:01:14,310
plus one.

848
02:01:17,890 --> 02:01:20,360
You got a right
to make a profit, too.

849
02:01:46,560 --> 02:01:48,250
I wouldn't take too long

850
02:01:48,320 --> 02:01:50,450
thinking about it
if I were you.

851
02:01:55,200 --> 02:01:57,630
You've got yourself into
something's bigger than you are.

852
02:01:57,670 --> 02:02:00,760
You got a chance to get out
easy, you better take it.

853
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:04,140
You sound like a real
businessman, Frank.

854
02:02:04,170 --> 02:02:07,510
Being with Mr. Morton
has done you a lot of good.

855
02:02:15,590 --> 02:02:17,180
And you've learned
some new methods.

856
02:02:19,390 --> 02:02:22,420
Yeah, Mr. Morton is showing you
a lot of new ways.

857
02:02:26,960 --> 02:02:29,830
Even though you haven't
given up the old ones.

858
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:34,360
Pick any method you like,
just make the deal.

859
02:02:36,510 --> 02:02:38,440
Which deal, Frank?

860
02:02:41,050 --> 02:02:43,410
We have more than one,
you and me.

861
02:02:46,920 --> 02:02:49,850
Well, we can...

862
02:02:49,890 --> 02:02:51,580
lump 'em together
into one bundle,

863
02:02:51,620 --> 02:02:52,680
settle all of them

864
02:02:52,720 --> 02:02:55,160
here and now.

865
02:02:57,030 --> 02:02:58,890
Easy, Frank.

866
02:02:58,930 --> 02:03:01,590
Easy.

867
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:03,900
You gotta learn
not to push things.

868
02:03:03,940 --> 02:03:07,200
Taking it easy is the first
thing a businessman should do.

869
02:03:10,010 --> 02:03:13,840
I got an idea Mr. Morton
can teach you a lot more.

870
02:03:18,120 --> 02:03:19,520
How much?

871
02:03:20,850 --> 02:03:22,220
One dollar.

872
02:04:27,490 --> 02:04:28,720
Giddy-up.

873
02:06:03,060 --> 02:06:05,050
Giddy-up.

874
02:07:08,760 --> 02:07:11,530
I could swear we're going
to have that strange sound.

875
02:07:11,560 --> 02:07:13,030
Right now.

876
02:09:05,480 --> 02:09:07,350
Time sure flies.

877
02:09:09,020 --> 02:09:10,950
It's already past 12:00.

878
02:10:10,620 --> 02:10:12,810
But... but they were his men.

879
02:10:12,850 --> 02:10:13,840
Yeah.

880
02:10:13,890 --> 02:10:15,880
And they tried to kill him.

881
02:10:15,920 --> 02:10:17,790
They must've found somebody
who pays better.

882
02:10:17,830 --> 02:10:18,850
And you...

883
02:10:18,890 --> 02:10:21,760
you saved his life.

884
02:10:23,770 --> 02:10:26,930
I didn't let them kill him
and that's not the same thing.

885
02:10:39,750 --> 02:10:41,980
Sure.

886
02:10:42,020 --> 02:10:45,040
It's not the same thing.

887
02:10:51,430 --> 02:10:53,260
You get dressed.

888
02:10:53,300 --> 02:10:54,960
It's time to go home.

889
02:16:13,500 --> 02:16:16,400
Did you make coffee?

890
02:16:17,640 --> 02:16:20,130
This time I did.

891
02:16:59,850 --> 02:17:01,610
Good.

892
02:17:03,720 --> 02:17:07,320
My mother used to make
coffee this way...

893
02:17:07,360 --> 02:17:11,390
hot, strong...

894
02:17:11,430 --> 02:17:13,090
and good.

895
02:17:21,910 --> 02:17:23,700
- Cheyenne.
- Huh?

896
02:17:25,510 --> 02:17:27,500
What's he waiting for out there?

897
02:17:30,850 --> 02:17:31,870
What's he doing?

898
02:17:37,620 --> 02:17:39,990
He's whittlin'
on a piece of wood.

899
02:17:42,960 --> 02:17:46,690
I got a feeling,
when he stops whittling,

900
02:17:46,730 --> 02:17:48,760
something's gonna happen.

901
02:18:58,080 --> 02:18:59,630
Surprised to see me here?

902
02:19:01,880 --> 02:19:03,180
I knew you'd come.

903
02:19:27,010 --> 02:19:31,140
Morton once told me
I could never be like him.

904
02:19:31,180 --> 02:19:33,800
Now I understand why.

905
02:19:34,680 --> 02:19:36,580
Wouldn't have bothered him

906
02:19:36,620 --> 02:19:38,740
knowing you were around
somewhere alive.

907
02:19:41,150 --> 02:19:42,920
So you found out
you're not a businessman

908
02:19:42,960 --> 02:19:44,890
after all.

909
02:19:44,930 --> 02:19:46,120
Just a man.

910
02:19:48,890 --> 02:19:51,190
An ancient race.

911
02:19:56,870 --> 02:19:58,930
Other Mortons will be along,

912
02:19:58,970 --> 02:20:01,130
and they'll kill it off.

913
02:20:01,180 --> 02:20:03,770
The future
don't matter to us.

914
02:20:03,810 --> 02:20:06,540
Nothing matters now...
not the land,

915
02:20:06,580 --> 02:20:08,980
not the money, not the woman.

916
02:20:09,020 --> 02:20:11,610
I came here to see you.

917
02:20:13,820 --> 02:20:14,790
'Cause I know

918
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:17,050
that now you'll tell me
what you're after.

919
02:20:32,270 --> 02:20:35,070
Only at the point of dying.

920
02:20:37,550 --> 02:20:39,010
I know.

921
02:21:23,130 --> 02:21:25,260
I heated some water for you.

922
02:21:25,300 --> 02:21:26,990
I also found a razor.

923
02:21:28,430 --> 02:21:30,090
Put it there, please...

924
02:21:32,670 --> 02:21:35,470
so I can watch
the railroad move up

925
02:21:35,510 --> 02:21:36,800
while I shave.

926
02:21:42,950 --> 02:21:44,510
You know what?

927
02:21:45,820 --> 02:21:46,840
If I was you,

928
02:21:46,890 --> 02:21:48,950
I'd go down there
and give those boys a drink.

929
02:21:58,430 --> 02:22:00,420
Can't imagine

930
02:22:00,470 --> 02:22:04,730
how happy it makes a man
to see a woman like you.

931
02:22:07,540 --> 02:22:09,030
Just to look at her.

932
02:22:12,810 --> 02:22:16,410
And if one of them
should, uh, pat your behind...

933
02:22:18,120 --> 02:22:20,780
just make believe it's nothing.

934
02:22:23,490 --> 02:22:24,790
They earned it.

935
02:26:59,050 --> 02:27:01,380
Keep your lovin' brother happy.

936
02:30:20,760 --> 02:30:23,130
Who-who are you?

937
02:31:31,200 --> 02:31:33,140
Hey...

938
02:31:33,170 --> 02:31:34,830
you're sort of a handsome man.

939
02:31:38,180 --> 02:31:40,080
But I'm not the right man.

940
02:31:52,890 --> 02:31:54,860
And neither is he.

941
02:31:57,330 --> 02:32:00,730
Maybe not...
but it doesn't matter.

942
02:32:05,010 --> 02:32:08,870
You don't understand, Jill.

943
02:32:08,910 --> 02:32:13,970
People like that
have something inside...

944
02:32:14,010 --> 02:32:15,480
something to do with death.

945
02:32:20,290 --> 02:32:21,550
That fella lives,

946
02:32:21,590 --> 02:32:23,820
he'll come in
through that door,

947
02:32:23,860 --> 02:32:27,350
pick up his gear and say adios.

948
02:32:33,070 --> 02:32:35,400
It would be nice
to see this town grow.

949
02:34:07,470 --> 02:34:08,760
Now I gotta go.

950
02:34:55,050 --> 02:34:57,480
It's gonna be a beautiful town...

951
02:34:57,520 --> 02:34:58,650
Sweetwater.

952
02:35:03,090 --> 02:35:05,960
I hope you'll come back someday.

953
02:35:23,210 --> 02:35:24,700
Someday.

954
02:35:37,290 --> 02:35:38,950
Yeah...

955
02:35:39,000 --> 02:35:40,990
I gotta go, too.

956
02:36:06,960 --> 02:36:08,790
Make believe it's nothing.

957
02:38:14,760 --> 02:38:19,160
Sorry, Harmonica,
I gotta stay here.

958
02:38:56,270 --> 02:38:58,830
Who?

959
02:39:02,310 --> 02:39:05,540
I ran into Mr. Choo-Choo.

960
02:39:05,580 --> 02:39:09,850
I didn't count
on that half-man from the train.

961
02:39:09,890 --> 02:39:11,380
He got scared.

962
02:39:29,740 --> 02:39:35,270
Hey, Harmonica,
when they do you in,

963
02:39:35,310 --> 02:39:38,110
pray it's somebody who knows
where to shoot.

964
02:39:53,760 --> 02:39:54,920
Go away.

965
02:39:57,300 --> 02:39:59,500
Go away.

966
02:39:59,540 --> 02:40:02,440
Go away. I don't want you
to see me die.

967
02:45:18,110 --> 02:45:19,020
