{\fs19}To bury my escort.

120
00:42:28,865 --> 00:42:32,483
{\fs24}如果等你 我現在已經在監獄裡了
{\fs19}If I'd waited for you, I'd be in jail by now.

121
00:42:58,937 --> 00:43:00,431
{\fs24}我的槍
{\fs19}The gun.

122
00:43:21,918 --> 00:43:25,536
{\fs24}你很趕時髦，口琴家？
{\fs19}You interested in fashions, Harmonica?

123
00:43:32,304 --> 00:43:35,055
{\fs24}不久之前我看到三件這樣的外套
{\fs19}I saw three of these dusters a short time ago.

124
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,304
{\fs24}在等一列火車
{\fs19}They were waiting for a train.

125
00:43:42,564 --> 00:43:45,814
{\fs24}三個穿這種外套的傢伙
{\fs19}Inside the dusters, there were three men.

126
00:43:48,236 --> 00:43:49,481
{\fs24}然後呢？
{\fs19}So?

127
00:43:50,697 --> 00:43:53,651
{\fs24}每個人身體裡都有一顆子彈
{\fs19}Inside the men, there were three bullets.

128
00:44:05,295 --> 00:44:08,664
{\fs24}騙人的故事，口琴家
{\fs19}That's a crazy story, Harmonica.

129
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:12,876
{\fs24}兩個原因
{\fs19}For two reasons.

130
00:44:13,011 --> 00:44:15,632
{\fs24}第一個，這裡沒有人
{\fs19}One, nobody around these parts

131
00:44:15,764 --> 00:44:19,133
{\fs24}敢穿這種外套 除了夏恩的人
{\fs19}got the guts to wear those dusters 
except Cheyenne's, man.

132
00:44:19,935 --> 00:44:24,228
{\fs24}第二個，夏恩的人 不會被殺
{\fs19}Two, Cheyenne's, man, don't get killed.

133
00:44:28,526 --> 00:44:30,519
{\fs24}你吃驚了嗎？
{\fs19}That surprise you?

134
00:44:30,654 --> 00:44:32,445
{\fs24}是的
{\fs19}Yeah.

135
00:44:36,409 --> 00:44:38,782
{\fs24}哦，你懂音樂
{\fs19}Well, you know music.

136
00:44:38,912 --> 00:44:43,075
{\fs24}還能把所有的東西數到二
{\fs19}And you can count. All the way up to two.

137
00:44:50,382 --> 00:44:53,418
{\fs24}數到六，如果我必須
{\fs19}All the way up to six, if I have to.

138
00:44:55,053 --> 00:44:57,295
{\fs24}也許要比你快
{\fs19}And maybe faster than you.

139
00:45:10,944 --> 00:45:12,771
{\fs24}好，繼續
{\fs19}Yeah, go on.

140
00:45:12,904 --> 00:45:15,111
{\fs24}吹吧，口琴家
{\fs19}Play, Harmonica.

141
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:18,075
{\fs24}吹吧，就不會胡言亂語了
{\fs19}Play, so you can't bullshit.

142
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:22,161
{\fs24}但是，小心那些錯誤的註解
{\fs19}Only, watch those false notes.

143
00:45:30,422 --> 00:45:31,916
{\fs24}比如？
{\fs19}Like so?

144
00:45:46,479 --> 00:45:50,263
{\fs24}我的這個表姊總是寫信邀請我去新奧爾良
{\fs19}This cousin of mine keeps writing 
me to come down to New Orleans.

145
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,149
{\fs24}「過來吧，幫我照料酒吧，多掙點錢」
{\fs19}"Come on down. Help me with the bar. 
Make a pile of money."

146
00:45:54,279 --> 00:45:57,114
{\fs24}我想我適應不了大城市的生活
{\fs19}I don't think I'd get along in a big city.

147
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,648
{\fs24}到處是放蕩的男人和女人
{\fs19}It's too full of fast men and loose women.

148
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:02,358
{\fs24}對不起，女士。不
{\fs19}Begging your pardon, ma'am. No.

149
00:46:03,121 --> 00:46:07,664
{\fs24}現在我習慣了安靜簡單的鄉下生活
{\fs19}Now, I'm too used to a quiet simple country life.

150
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:39,942
{\fs24}他是提米
{\fs19}He's Timmy.

151
00:48:40,779 --> 00:48:43,067
{\fs24}是的
{\fs19}Yes.

152
00:48:43,198 --> 00:48:45,274
{\fs24}天哪
{\fs19}Dear God.

153
00:48:46,701 --> 00:48:48,611
{\fs24}那天
{\fs19}On the day

154
00:48:49,746 --> 00:48:52,949
{\fs24}在你婚禮的那天
{\fs19}On the very day of your wedding.

155
00:48:54,042 --> 00:48:56,165
{\fs24}可憐的小姐
{\fs19}Poor little miss.

156
00:48:57,128 --> 00:48:59,121
{\fs24}夫人
{\fs19}Mrs.

157
00:49:00,423 --> 00:49:02,083
{\fs24}馬克貝恩夫人
{\fs19}Mrs McBain.

158
00:49:02,217 --> 00:49:05,218
{\fs24}但是我們都我們以為
{\fs19}But we all We thought

159
00:49:06,096 --> 00:49:07,590
{\fs24}我知道
{\fs19}I know.

160
00:49:07,722 --> 00:49:11,850
{\fs24}今天你們一定很吃驚
{\fs19}It was to be a surprise today.

161
00:49:11,977 --> 00:49:14,349
{\fs24}布賴特.馬克貝恩和我結了婚
{\fs19}Brett McBain and I were married.

162
00:49:14,479 --> 00:49:16,637
{\fs24}一個月之前
{\fs19}A month ago.

163
00:49:16,773 --> 00:49:19,608
{\fs24}在新奧爾良
{\fs19}In New Orleans.

164
00:49:35,625 --> 00:49:37,867
{\fs24}復活在我，生命也在我
{\fs19}I am the resurrection and the life.

165
00:49:38,003 --> 00:49:41,585
{\fs24}信我的人，雖然死了，也必復活
{\fs19}He who believeth in me, though he 
were dead, yet shall he live.

166
00:49:41,715 --> 00:49:46,009
{\fs24}凡活著信我的人，必永遠不死。阿門
{\fs19}Whosoever liveth and believeth 
in me shall never die. Amen.

167
00:50:02,152 --> 00:50:04,939
{\fs24}貝奈特先生！  他在這裡做什麼？
{\fs19} Mr Bennett!  What's he doing here?

168
00:50:08,325 --> 00:50:10,650
{\fs24}我發現這個衣領，釘在門上
{\fs19}I found this collar on a nail by the door.

169
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:18,954
{\fs24}你沒辦法知道 但這是個最好的簽名
{\fs19}You got no way of knowing, but 
this is as good as a signature.

170
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:21,125
{\fs24}夏恩的手下
{\fs19}Cheyenne's hand.

171
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:26,337
{\fs24}但是為什麼？  別著急，馬克貝恩女士
{\fs19} But why?  Don't worry, Mrs McBain.

172
00:50:26,468 --> 00:50:28,959
{\fs24}在絞死他們之前，我們會讓他們說的
{\fs19}We'll make 'em tell us before we hang 'em.

173
00:50:30,513 --> 00:50:32,387
{\fs24}我們走吧
{\fs19}Let's get moving.

174
00:50:51,743 --> 00:50:55,871
{\fs24}走吧 我們回石板鎮吧
{\fs19}Come on. Let's go back to Flagstone.

175
00:50:58,541 --> 00:51:00,830
{\fs24}不，山姆
{\fs19}No, Sam.

176
00:51:02,254 --> 00:51:04,460
{\fs24}你回去吧
{\fs19}You go back.

177
00:51:04,589 --> 00:51:08,124
{\fs24}你不會想一個人留在這裡吧
{\fs19}You don't want to stay out here alone.

178
00:51:09,094 --> 00:51:10,636
{\fs24}為什麼不呢？
{\fs19}Why not?

179
00:51:10,762 --> 00:51:12,589
{\fs24}這是我的家
{\fs19}This is my home.

180
00:55:11,962 --> 00:55:13,372
{\fs24}知道嗎，無賴
{\fs19}You know, Wobbles,

181
00:55:15,423 --> 00:55:18,045
{\fs24}你讓我發火了
{\fs19}..I'm kinda mad at you.

182
00:55:21,263 --> 00:55:23,302
{\fs24}弗蘭克不在那兒
{\fs19}Frank wasn't there.

183
00:55:24,683 --> 00:55:27,221
{\fs24}他叫了三個朋友去
{\fs19}He sent three friends.

184
00:55:27,352 --> 00:55:30,021
{\fs24}我什麼都不知道，我發誓
{\fs19}I don't know nothing, I swear.

185
00:55:30,146 --> 00:55:34,689
{\fs24}我只是按你的意思安排了那個會面
{\fs19}I only arranged the meeting the way you wanted it.

186
00:55:34,818 --> 00:55:38,151
{\fs24}我不知道為什麼弗蘭克沒去
{\fs19}I don't know why Frank wasn't there.

187
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:41,898
{\fs24}我對你發誓我  因為他在馬克貝恩家
{\fs19} I swear to you that ICaus he was at the McBains'.

188
00:55:42,617 --> 00:55:45,404
{\fs24}不是他 那是夏恩做的
{\fs19}That's not true. Cheyenne did that job.

189
00:55:45,537 --> 00:55:48,324
{\fs24}每個人都知道，我們有證據
{\fs19}Everyone knows that. We got proof.

190
00:55:48,456 --> 00:55:52,620
{\fs24}那不過是弗蘭克玩的把戲，捏造證據
{\fs19}That was always one of Frank's tricks. Faking evidence.

191
00:55:54,671 --> 00:55:57,672
{\fs24}我不知道，我發誓
{\fs19}I don't know. I swear.

192
00:55:57,799 --> 00:56:02,128
{\fs24}我只是安排了會面，我發誓
{\fs19}I only arranged the meeting. I swear.

193
00:56:02,262 --> 00:56:04,717
{\fs24}我什麼都不知道
{\fs19}I don't know nothing.

194
00:58:05,010 --> 00:58:07,002
{\fs24}誰在那兒？
{\fs19}Who's there?

195
01:00:39,289 --> 01:00:40,700
{\fs24}你會做咖啡嗎？
{\fs19}Did you make coffee?

196
01:00:44,794 --> 01:00:46,419
{\fs24}去做
{\fs19}Make it.

197
01:00:54,262 --> 01:00:56,302
{\fs24}一晚上沒合眼
{\fs19}Didn't sleep a wink.

198
01:00:56,431 --> 01:01:00,808
{\fs24}一群黑衣服的卑鄙小人追了我整整一夜
{\fs19}A pack of turds dressed in black rode 
herd on me the whole damn night.

199
01:01:03,605 --> 01:01:07,021
{\fs24}是的，不過我把他們甩到沙漠裡了
{\fs19}Yeah, but I left them in the middle of the desert.

200
01:01:07,150 --> 01:01:10,566
{\fs24}幸運的話，他們三天後會回來
{\fs19}If they're lucky, they'll be home in three days.

201
01:01:28,838 --> 01:01:32,290
{\fs24}我做這個。你去拿咖啡
{\fs19}I'll do it. You fetch the coffee.

202
01:01:38,056 --> 01:01:42,884
{\fs24}他們想絞死我 那些黑烏鴉
{\fs19}They want to hang me, the big black crows.

203
01:01:44,437 --> 01:01:46,395
{\fs24}白癡
{\fs19}Idiots.

204
01:01:46,523 --> 01:01:48,314
{\fs24}為什麼？
{\fs19}What the hell?

205
01:01:48,441 --> 01:01:51,395
{\fs24}我會殺任何人，但是決不包括孩子
{\fs19}I'll kill anything, but never a kid.

206
01:01:52,279 --> 01:01:54,734
{\fs24}可以去殺神父
{\fs19}Be like killing a priest.

207
01:01:54,864 --> 01:01:57,272
{\fs24}一個天主教的神父，僅此而已
{\fs19}A Catholic priest, that is.

208
01:01:58,034 --> 01:02:01,368
{\fs24}是啊，這個世界上有很多人痛恨夏恩
{\fs19}Yeah, the world is full of people who hate Cheyenne.

209
01:02:16,511 --> 01:02:20,556
{\fs24}看，我並不是人們所說的那種混蛋
{\fs19}See, I ain't the mean bastard people make out.

210
01:02:24,144 --> 01:02:29,351
{\fs24}當然，如果有人想殺我
{\fs19}Of course, if somebody had a mind to kill me,

211
01:02:31,735 --> 01:02:33,811
{\fs24}激怒我
{\fs19}..it fires me up.

212
01:02:34,905 --> 01:02:37,442
{\fs24}被激怒了的夏恩
{\fs19}And a fired-up Cheyenne

213
01:02:40,076 --> 01:02:42,614
{\fs24}可不是好惹的
{\fs19}..ain't a nice thing to see.

214
01:02:42,746 --> 01:02:44,904
{\fs24}特別是對於一個女士
{\fs19}Especially for a lady.

215
01:02:57,844 --> 01:03:00,845
{\fs24}但是你很聰明不會去激怒他
{\fs19}But you're too smart to make him mad.

216
01:03:05,518 --> 01:03:09,730
{\fs24}這就是那個說我殺了所有人的地方嗎？
{\fs19}So this here's where I was supposed to do all the killing?

217
01:03:11,233 --> 01:03:13,272
{\fs24}哼
{\fs19}Yeah.

218
01:03:14,277 --> 01:03:17,064
{\fs24}沒看出來哪裡值得
{\fs19}Don't seem the place is worth a shit.

219
01:03:23,203 --> 01:03:27,781
{\fs24}那麼，如果有人打扮得像我一樣
{\fs19}Now, if somebody gets dressed up to look like me,

220
01:03:31,419 --> 01:03:34,373
{\fs24}他們就可以把這事扯在我頭上
{\fs19}..so they can hang this thing around my neck,

221
01:03:35,507 --> 01:03:37,630
{\fs24}我一點也不喜歡這樣
{\fs19}..I don't like it none.

222
01:03:38,802 --> 01:03:40,925
{\fs24}但是可以理解
{\fs19}But I can understand it.

223
01:03:45,642 --> 01:03:50,103
{\fs24}我不明白的是為了什麼
{\fs19}What I don't understand is why.

224
01:03:51,147 --> 01:03:52,807
{\fs24}我也不明白
{\fs19}Neither do l.

225
01:03:57,362 --> 01:04:00,897
{\fs24}但是我覺得你知道的很多
{\fs19}But I see you looked a lot for the why.

226
01:04:07,455 --> 01:04:08,736
{\fs24}沒錯
{\fs19}Yeah.

227
01:04:11,918 --> 01:04:15,619
{\fs24}如果有一整堆問題呢？
{\fs19}What if there were a whole heap of whys?

228
01:04:16,464 --> 01:04:19,999
{\fs24}圓的，黃的（形容各種豆子）
{\fs19}Round. Yellow.

229
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:22,676
{\fs24}你知道的
{\fs19}You know the kind.

230
01:04:23,722 --> 01:04:25,880
{\fs24}你把他們扔到石頭上
{\fs19}You rap 'em on a stone,

231
01:04:27,183 --> 01:04:29,472
{\fs24}他們辟啪作響
{\fs19}..and they go "ding".

232
01:04:29,603 --> 01:04:30,765
{\fs24}也許
{\fs19}Maybe.

233
01:04:33,315 --> 01:04:35,521
{\fs24}但是我還沒有找到他們
{\fs19}But I didn't find them.

234
01:04:41,406 --> 01:04:43,280
{\fs24}順便問一下
{\fs19}By the way,

235
01:04:43,408 --> 01:04:48,319
{\fs24}你知不知道一個到處吹口琴的傢伙
{\fs19}you know anything about a man 
going around playing a harmonica?

236
01:04:50,457 --> 01:04:53,162
{\fs24}你應該記住他
{\fs19}He's somebody you'd remember.

237
01:04:54,210 --> 01:04:56,832
{\fs24}他不說話而吹口琴
{\fs19}Instead of talking, he plays.

238
01:04:57,672 --> 01:05:00,507
{\fs24}當他應該吹的時候，他卻說話
{\fs19}And when he'd better play, he talks.

239
01:05:04,638 --> 01:05:08,422
{\fs24}如果你已經殺了四個 很容易再有第五個
{\fs19}You know, when you've killed four, 
it's easy to make it five.

240
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:15,356
{\fs24}確實如此，你是個行家
{\fs19}Sure. You're an expert.

241
01:05:20,195 --> 01:05:22,982
{\fs24}夫人，看起來你沒有理解我的意思
{\fs19}Ma'am, it seems to me you ain't caught the idea.

242
01:05:27,911 --> 01:05:30,828
{\fs24}我當然明白
{\fs19}Of course I have.

243
01:05:31,581 --> 01:05:34,784
{\fs24}我孤單一個人 落在一夥見錢眼開的強盜手裡
{\fs19}I'm here alone in the hands of 
a bandit who smelled money.

244
01:05:34,918 --> 01:05:38,583
{\fs24}如果你願意，你可以凌辱我尋開心
{\fs19}If you want to, you can lay me over 
the table and amuse yourself.

245
01:05:38,713 --> 01:05:40,505
{\fs24}甚或叫你的人進來
{\fs19}And even call in your men.

246
01:05:40,632 --> 01:05:43,384
{\fs24}沒關係，沒有女人因為那樣而死
{\fs19}Well, no woman ever died from that.

247
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:47,590
{\fs24}你完事後，我需要的僅僅是一盆開水
{\fs19}When you're finished, all I'll need 
will be a tub of boiling water,

248
01:05:47,722 --> 01:05:49,964
{\fs24}然後我會和以前完全一樣
{\fs19}and I'll be exactly what I was before.

249
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:53,682
{\fs24}不過是又多了一個骯髒的回憶而已
{\fs19}With just another filthy memory.

250
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:12,742
{\fs24}你的咖啡還不錯
{\fs19}You make good coffee, at least.

251
01:06:13,373 --> 01:06:14,867
{\fs24}不錯
{\fs19}Not bad.

252
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,158
{\fs24}恭喜你
{\fs19}Congratulations.

253
01:06:17,294 --> 01:06:21,338
{\fs24}告訴我，有沒有必要把他們全部殺掉？
{\fs19}Tell me, was it necessary that you kill all of them?

254
01:06:21,464 --> 01:06:24,501
{\fs24}我只是告訴你嚇嚇他們
{\fs19}I only told you to scare them.

255
01:06:24,634 --> 01:06:27,635
{\fs24}當他們死亡的時候是最恐懼的時候
{\fs19}People scare better when they're dying.

256
01:06:27,762 --> 01:06:31,677
{\fs24}你能說說你的屠殺有什麼好處嗎？
{\fs19}And can you tell me what good 
was your stupid massacre?

257
01:06:32,767 --> 01:06:35,555
{\fs24}現在，出來了一個馬克貝恩夫人
{\fs19}Now, a Mrs McBain has turned up.

258
01:06:37,981 --> 01:06:41,184
{\fs24}我沒有料到那個 是個意外
{\fs19}So, I didn't expect that. It happens in business.

259
01:06:41,318 --> 01:06:44,769
{\fs24}這麼說吧這是我們沒有計劃到的
{\fs19}Let's say this is something I didn't plan on.

260
01:06:45,614 --> 01:06:48,817
{\fs24}我沒有時間去吃驚了，弗蘭克
{\fs19}I have no time for surprises, Frank.

261
01:06:50,243 --> 01:06:52,615
{\fs24}你知道
{\fs19}You know that.

262
01:06:52,746 --> 01:06:56,790
{\fs24}我要上船去看一看大西洋
{\fs19}I got on board in sight of the Atlantic,

263
01:06:56,917 --> 01:07:00,120
{\fs24}在我的眼睛瞎掉之前
{\fs19}and before my eyes rot,

264
01:07:00,253 --> 01:07:05,758
{\fs24}我想看看窗外藍色的大西洋
{\fs19}I want to see the blue of the Pacific outside that window.

265
01:07:05,884 --> 01:07:08,291
{\fs24}我知道你在哪裡上火車的
{\fs19}I know where you got on board.

266
01:07:08,428 --> 01:07:10,836
{\fs24}別忘了，我也在那裡
{\fs19}I was there, too, remember.

267
01:07:15,769 --> 01:07:22,139
{\fs24}清除掉道路上的障礙，你說過
{\fs19}To remove small obstacles from the track, you said.

268
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:24,688
{\fs24}哦，還有一些
{\fs19}Well, there were a few.

269
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:32,284
{\fs24}但是我們走了很遠 還是一樣
{\fs19}But we travelled a long way, just the same.

270
01:07:32,410 --> 01:07:33,988
{\fs24}而且很快
{\fs19}And fast.

271
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:37,988
{\fs24}骨頭上的結核也走得很快
{\fs19}Even tuberculosis of the bones travels fast.

272
01:07:39,751 --> 01:07:43,665
{\fs24}別把我當病人，莫頓先生
{\fs19}Don't play the sick man with me, Mr Morton.

273
01:07:43,797 --> 01:07:47,082
{\fs24}你剛剛開始腿瘸我就認識你了
{\fs19}I knew you when you were just barely limping.

274
01:07:49,886 --> 01:07:53,966
{\fs24}我看著你那枯掉的肢體一天天吞噬你
{\fs19}I watch that dry rot rise a little more every day.

275
01:07:56,393 --> 01:07:58,884
{\fs24}任何一個正常人都會給自己來顆子彈的
{\fs19}Any normal man'd put a bullet in his brain.

276
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:03,065
{\fs24}然而你，只是變得稍微有些急躁
{\fs19}But you, you just got a little more hasty.

277
01:08:03,942 --> 01:08:06,267
{\fs24}別的你一點都沒變
{\fs19}Otherwise you ain't changed any.

278
01:08:06,403 --> 01:08:08,858
{\fs24}你變了，弗蘭克
{\fs19}I'd say you've changed, Frank.

279
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:10,483
{\fs24}很多
{\fs19}A lot.

280
01:08:11,700 --> 01:08:15,318
{\fs24}你過去總是親自去做事情
{\fs19}You used to take care of certain things personally.

281
01:08:16,913 --> 01:08:20,578
{\fs24}現在，你要隱藏在幕後
{\fs19}Now, you're keeping in the background.

282
01:08:21,668 --> 01:08:24,206
{\fs24}你會最終發號施令
{\fs19}You'll end up giving orders.

283
01:08:25,964 --> 01:08:29,415
{\fs24}因為，目前，我不想讓你總是一個人
{\fs19}It's because, now, I don't want to 
leave you alone too much.

284
01:08:31,928 --> 01:08:36,175
{\fs24}你需要越來越多的人和你在一起
{\fs19}You're gonna need somebody more and 
more every day to stay near you.

285
01:08:36,308 --> 01:08:38,977
{\fs24}朋友  或是同夥
{\fs19} Like a friend.  Or like a partner.

286
01:08:49,654 --> 01:08:53,189
{\fs24}感覺如何 坐在那個桌子後面，弗蘭克？
{\fs19}How does it feel sitting behind that desk, Frank?

287
01:08:56,244 --> 01:08:58,866
{\fs24}就像握著一把槍
{\fs19}It's almost like holding a gun.

288
01:09:03,501 --> 01:09:06,419
{\fs24}不過更有威力些
{\fs19}Only much more powerful.

289
01:09:21,603 --> 01:09:25,932
{\fs24}你看，和你在一起，我
{\fs19}You see, staying with you, l

290
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:30,395
{\fs24}我也變得目光遠大了
{\fs19}..I'm beginning to think big, too.

291
01:09:33,114 --> 01:09:35,902
{\fs24}這次馬克貝恩事件
{\fs19}This McBain business

292
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:39,486
{\fs24}給了我一個想法
{\fs19}..has given me ideas.

293
01:09:45,877 --> 01:09:48,415
{\fs24}什麼意思，弗蘭克
{\fs19}I'm sorry for you, Frank.

294
01:09:48,546 --> 01:09:50,788
{\fs24}你做的很好
{\fs19}You're doing your best.

295
01:09:51,758 --> 01:09:54,166
{\fs24}但是你永遠無法取得像我一樣的成功
{\fs19}You'll never succeed in becoming like me.

296
01:09:57,097 --> 01:09:58,211
{\fs24}為什麼？
{\fs19}Why?

297
01:09:58,348 --> 01:10:03,971
{\fs24}因為有很多事情你永遠都不會不明白
{\fs19}Because there are many things you'll never understand.

298
01:10:15,240 --> 01:10:17,695
{\fs24}這就是其中之一
{\fs19}This is one of them.

299
01:10:17,826 --> 01:10:21,444
{\fs24}看，弗蘭克，有很多種武器
{\fs19}You see, Frank, there are many kinds of weapons.

300
01:10:21,580 --> 01:10:26,621
{\fs24}唯一能平息這場風波的是它
{\fs19}And the only one that can stop that is this.

301
01:11:20,388 --> 01:11:23,638
{\fs24}現在應該回到我們的小麻煩上了吧？
{\fs19}Now, shall we get back to our little problem?

302
01:11:25,852 --> 01:11:29,102
{\fs24}也許你認為我的武器很簡單，莫頓先生
{\fs19}My weapons might look simple to you, Mr Morton,

303
01:11:30,440 --> 01:11:34,272
{\fs24}但它仍舊可以在我們的小麻煩上打個窟窿
{\fs19}but they can still shoot holes big 
enough for our little problems.

304
01:11:35,278 --> 01:11:39,276
{\fs24}過不久那個馬克貝恩寡婦 就不再是個麻煩了
{\fs19}Pretty soon the widow McBain 
won't be a problem no more.

305
01:11:40,575 --> 01:11:44,869
{\fs24}清晨，你醒來說 「世界，我瞭解你」
{\fs19}You wake up one morning and say, "World, I know you."

306
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:47,701
{\fs24}「從現在開始，不再有驚奇」
{\fs19}"From now on, there are no more surprises."

307
01:11:47,832 --> 01:11:50,370
{\fs24}然後你偶爾碰倒了一個這樣的男人
{\fs19}And then you happen to meet a man like this,

308
01:11:50,502 --> 01:11:52,329
{\fs24}看起來像是一個好男人
{\fs19}who looked like a good man.

309
01:11:52,462 --> 01:11:55,214
{\fs24}清澈的目光，強壯的臂膀
{\fs19}Clear eyes, strong hands.

310
01:11:55,340 --> 01:11:57,249
{\fs24}他想娶你
{\fs19}And he wants to marry you.

311
01:11:57,384 --> 01:11:59,542
{\fs24}這種事不常發生
{\fs19}Which doesn't happen often.

312
01:11:59,678 --> 01:12:02,714
{\fs24}他說他還很富有，那並不重要
{\fs19}And he says he's rich, too, which doesn't hurt.

313
01:12:05,892 --> 01:12:09,178
{\fs24}所以你想 「見鬼去吧，新奧爾良」
{\fs19}So you think, "The hell with New Orleans."

314
01:12:09,312 --> 01:12:12,349
{\fs24}「現在我要說願意還要去鄉下生活」
{\fs19}"Now I'll say yes and go live in the country."

315
01:12:14,317 --> 01:12:18,232
{\fs24}「我不介意給她生一群孩子」
{\fs19}"l wouldn't mind giving him half a dozen kids after all."

316
01:12:19,030 --> 01:12:23,739
{\fs24}「照料房子，隨便做些事情」
{\fs19}"Take care of a house. Do something. What the hell?"

317
01:12:34,504 --> 01:12:37,671
{\fs24}唔，願主使你的靈魂安息吧，布賴特.馬克貝恩
{\fs19}Well, God rest your soul, Brett McBain.

318
01:12:37,799 --> 01:12:42,757
{\fs24}就算他需要去使你脫離惡魔的控制
{\fs19}Even if he's going to have a job 
pulling you out of the devil's grip.

319
01:12:57,360 --> 01:13:00,776
{\fs24}我仍舊願意發誓 他一定在什麼地方留下了財產
{\fs19}Still, I swear he'd left money around someplace.

320
01:13:02,908 --> 01:13:05,577
{\fs24}如果你能發現就歸你好了
{\fs19}If you can find it, you're welcome to it.

321
01:13:05,702 --> 01:13:08,407
{\fs24}馬克貝恩夫人要回文明社會去了
{\fs19}Mrs McBain goes back to civilisation.

322
01:13:08,538 --> 01:13:12,156
{\fs24}少了一個丈夫，卻多了一個好前程
{\fs19}Minus a husband and plus a great future.

323
01:13:24,971 --> 01:13:27,011
{\fs24}你應該過得更好
{\fs19}You deserve better.

324
01:13:28,725 --> 01:13:33,221
{\fs24}上一個對我那樣說的男人就埋在那兒
{\fs19}The last man who told me that is buried out there.

325
01:13:42,781 --> 01:13:45,236
{\fs24}知道嗎，吉兒，你讓我想到了我母親
{\fs19}You know, Jill, you remind me of my mother.

326
01:13:48,828 --> 01:13:51,664
{\fs24}她是Alameida最出名的妓女
{\fs19}She was the biggest whore in Alameida

327
01:13:51,790 --> 01:13:54,874
{\fs24}世界上最好的女人
{\fs19}and the finest woman that ever lived.

328
01:13:55,919 --> 01:13:59,454
{\fs24}無論我父親是誰，一個小時抑或一個月
{\fs19}Whoever my father was, for an hour or for a month,

329
01:14:00,715 --> 01:14:03,253
{\fs24}他都一定是個開心的男人
{\fs19}..he must have been a happy man.

330
01:15:24,341 --> 01:15:26,380
{\fs24}你想要什麼？
{\fs19}What do you want?

331
01:15:27,969 --> 01:15:33,177
{\fs24}夏恩是對的。一旦你殺四個人 很容易殺第五個
{\fs19}Cheyenne's right. Once you've killed 
four, it's easy to make it five.

332
01:15:46,947 --> 01:15:49,402
{\fs24}現在還不是走的時候
{\fs19}This isn't the time to leave.

333
01:16:51,636 --> 01:16:53,843
{\fs24}給我點水
{\fs19}Give me some water.

334
01:17:03,023 --> 01:17:05,264
{\fs24}從井裡
{\fs19}From the well.

335
01:17:06,276 --> 01:17:09,028
{\fs24}我喜歡乾淨的水
{\fs19}I like my water fresh.

336
01:18:35,240 --> 01:18:38,823
{\fs24}如果你聽到奇怪的聲響，就匐倒在地上
{\fs19}When you hear a strange sound, drop to the ground.

337
01:18:38,952 --> 01:18:41,787
{\fs24}聲響？什麼聲響？
{\fs19}A sound? Like what?

338
01:18:43,248 --> 01:18:44,659
{\fs24}就像那樣
{\fs19}Like that.

339
01:19:15,697 --> 01:19:20,110
{\fs24}他不止會吹口琴，還能開槍
{\fs19}He not only plays, he can shoot, too.

340
01:19:54,110 --> 01:19:55,735
{\fs24}早上好，馬克貝恩夫人
{\fs19}Morning, Mrs McBain.

341
01:19:55,862 --> 01:19:58,400
{\fs24}什麼風把你吹到這兒來了？  早上好
{\fs19} What brings you to town?  Good morning.

342
01:19:58,531 --> 01:20:01,865
{\fs24}也許你不記得了，昨天在葬禮上
{\fs19}Maybe you don't remember, but yesterday at the funeral

343
01:20:01,993 --> 01:20:03,950
{\fs24}我記得很清楚
{\fs19}I remember very well.

344
01:20:04,079 --> 01:20:06,996
{\fs24}有什麼我可以幫你的嗎？
{\fs19}Is there something I can do for you?

345
01:20:08,041 --> 01:20:09,868
{\fs24}是的
{\fs19}Yes.

346
01:20:11,544 --> 01:20:15,412
{\fs24}去見弗蘭克。告訴他我什麼都知道了
{\fs19}See Frank. And tell him I know everything.

347
01:20:15,548 --> 01:20:18,502
{\fs24}為什麼麼個人都找我打聽弗蘭克這傢伙
{\fs19}Why is everybody hounding me about this guy Frank?

348
01:20:18,635 --> 01:20:21,208
{\fs24}我不認識他 我從來都沒有聽說過這個人
{\fs19}I don't know him. I've never heard of him.

349
01:20:21,346 --> 01:20:24,596
{\fs24}我也很苦惱，我想安安穩穩的生活
{\fs19}I got my own worries, and all I want is to be left in peace.

350
01:20:24,724 --> 01:20:28,936
{\fs24}告訴弗蘭克，我想和他談判，親自
{\fs19}Tell Frank I want to negotiate with him. Personally.

351
01:21:23,533 --> 01:21:27,068
{\fs24}告訴過你任何情況都不要來這裡
{\fs19}You were told not to come here for any reason.

352
01:21:27,203 --> 01:21:30,987
{\fs24}我不管你和弗蘭克有什麼交易 離這裡遠一點
{\fs19}Whatever business you have with Frank, 
keep it far away from here.

353
01:21:31,124 --> 01:21:34,742
{\fs24}我知道 但是當我聽那個女人說他知道一切時
{\fs19}I know, but when I heard that woman 
say she knew everything,

354
01:21:34,878 --> 01:21:38,128
{\fs24}我覺得我應該來這兒告訴你這些
{\fs19}I thought I should come over here and tell you about it.

355
01:21:38,256 --> 01:21:40,296
{\fs24}你沒有想到會是個圈套嗎？
{\fs19}You never thought it wasn't a trick?

356
01:21:40,425 --> 01:21:42,797
{\fs24}當然，但是你知道我非常謹慎
{\fs19}Sure, but you know I'm mighty careful.

357
01:21:42,928 --> 01:21:45,086
{\fs24}沒有人能跟著我
{\fs19}No one could have followed me.

358
01:21:45,221 --> 01:21:48,092
{\fs24}那試我為你工作學到的第一件事
{\fs19}That's the first thing I learned, working for you.

359
01:21:48,224 --> 01:21:50,680
{\fs24}去聽看不到的，去看聽不到的
{\fs19}To listen unseen and to watch unheard.

360
01:21:50,810 --> 01:21:55,104
{\fs24}你應該去學習如何彷彿不存在一樣生活
{\fs19}You should learn to live as if you didn't exist.

361
01:21:55,231 --> 01:21:57,557
{\fs24}你認識我很長時間了，弗蘭克
{\fs19}You've known me a long time, Frank.

362
01:21:57,692 --> 01:21:59,649
{\fs24}你知道你可以相信我
{\fs19}You know you can trust me.

363
01:21:59,778 --> 01:22:01,438
{\fs24}無賴的傢伙
{\fs19}Wobbles.

364
01:22:05,533 --> 01:22:09,911
{\fs24}誰會相信一個穿著吊帶庫卻系皮帶的傢伙
{\fs19}How can you trust a man who wears 
both a belt and suspenders?

365
01:22:10,789 --> 01:22:13,576
{\fs24}他連自己的褲子都不相信
{\fs19}The man can't even trust his own pants.

366
01:22:23,218 --> 01:22:24,795
{\fs24}我們離開這裡
{\fs19}Let's get out of here.

367
01:24:04,486 --> 01:24:06,360
{\fs24}線路的終點
{\fs19}The end of the line.

368
01:24:09,449 --> 01:24:10,445
{\fs24}是啊
{\fs19}Yeah.

369
01:24:16,373 --> 01:24:17,783
{\fs24}帶他上來
{\fs19}Get him on board.

370
01:24:32,472 --> 01:24:34,381
{\fs24}捆上他
{\fs19}Tie him up.

371
01:25:08,425 --> 01:25:10,049
{\fs24}等一等，弗蘭克
{\fs19}Wait, Frank.

372
01:25:10,176 --> 01:25:11,671
{\fs24}我沒有
{\fs19}I didn't

373
01:25:11,803 --> 01:25:13,297
{\fs24}好啊，沒有人跟蹤你？
{\fs19}So, nobody followed you?

374
01:25:13,888 --> 01:25:16,214
{\fs24}沒有，你應該相信我
{\fs19}No. You gotta believe me.

375
01:25:17,225 --> 01:25:19,930
{\fs24}我只能這樣相信你
{\fs19}So, this is the way I can trust you.

376
01:25:20,061 --> 01:25:22,848
{\fs24}我可以解釋 我不知道那傢伙
{\fs19}I can explain. I didn't know that he

377
01:25:23,940 --> 01:25:26,265
{\fs24}滾出去  不，弗蘭克
{\fs19} Get out.  No, Frank.

378
01:25:27,027 --> 01:25:28,651
{\fs24}滾出去
{\fs19}Get out.

379
01:25:47,797 --> 01:25:49,956
{\fs24}弗蘭克，等一下！
{\fs19}Frank, wait!

380
01:26:11,446 --> 01:26:14,530
{\fs24}我告訴你不要出聲
{\fs19}I told you to keep quiet.

381
01:26:18,536 --> 01:26:21,324
{\fs24}Logan和吉姆解決掉那個女人了嗎？
{\fs19}Did Logan and Jim take care of the woman?

382
01:26:21,456 --> 01:26:23,662
{\fs24}一些人在處理他們
{\fs19}Someone took care of them.

383
01:26:23,792 --> 01:26:26,247
{\fs24}我們在馬克貝恩家附近發現了他們
{\fs19}We found them out at McBain's place.

384
01:26:26,378 --> 01:26:29,379
{\fs24}死了 那個女人不見了
{\fs19}Stone dead. And the woman was gone.

385
01:26:29,506 --> 01:26:33,206
{\fs24}你朋友們的死亡率很高麼，弗蘭克
{\fs19}Your friends have a high mortality rate, Frank.

386
01:26:44,729 --> 01:26:47,185
{\fs24}早先的三個，又有兩個
{\fs19}First three, then two.

387
01:26:59,202 --> 01:27:01,954
{\fs24}你就是那個約我的傢伙
{\fs19}So you're the one who makes appointments.

388
01:27:03,331 --> 01:27:06,332
{\fs24}你就是那個沒有赴約的傢伙
{\fs19}And you're the one who doesn't keep 'em.

389
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:10,118
{\fs24}你想要什麼？
{\fs19}What do you want?

390
01:27:11,298 --> 01:27:13,421
{\fs24}你是誰？
{\fs19}Who are you?

391
01:27:16,052 --> 01:27:17,677
{\fs24}戴夫.詹金斯
{\fs19}Dave Jenkins.

392
01:27:26,021 --> 01:27:28,428
{\fs24}戴夫.詹金斯很久以前就死了
{\fs19}Dave Jenkins is dead a long time ago.

393
01:27:29,900 --> 01:27:31,607
{\fs24}卡德.本森
{\fs19}Calder Benson.

394
01:27:33,445 --> 01:27:35,817
{\fs24}你的名字？ 本森也已經死了
{\fs19}What's your name? Benson's dead, too.

395
01:27:37,782 --> 01:27:39,905
{\fs24}你應該比別人都清楚
{\fs19}You ought to know better than anyone.

396
01:27:40,460 --> 01:27:41,919
{\fs24}你殺了他們？
{\fs19}You killed 'em.

397
01:27:42,546 --> 01:27:43,541
{\fs24}你是誰？
{\fs19}Who are you?

398
01:27:43,672 --> 01:27:45,914
{\fs24}你到底是誰？你  弗蘭克！
{\fs19} Who are you, you  Frank!

399
01:27:48,426 --> 01:27:50,585
{\fs24}那個女人
{\fs19}The woman.

400
01:27:52,347 --> 01:27:54,920
{\fs24}我們這是在浪費時間
{\fs19}We're only losing time.

401
01:27:59,271 --> 01:28:04,063
{\fs24}好吧。這次，我要親自去會一會她
{\fs19}Alright. This time, I'll take care of her personally.

402
01:28:04,192 --> 01:28:06,683
{\fs24}對啊，這對你來說在容易不過了
{\fs19}Yeah, it ought to be easy for you.

403
01:28:11,575 --> 01:28:13,698
{\fs24}讓他在這裡暖和暖和
{\fs19}Keep him warm for me.

404
01:28:13,827 --> 01:28:16,234
{\fs24}他要是找麻煩，就打他！
{\fs19}If he gives you any trouble, hit him.

405
01:28:16,371 --> 01:28:20,784
{\fs24}不要打嘴 他還要講話呢， 而且要說很多
{\fs19}Not in the mouth. He's got to talk. And plenty.

406
01:28:25,881 --> 01:28:28,419
{\fs24}在納瓦霍懸崖等我
{\fs19}Meet me at the Navajo cliff.

407
01:28:28,550 --> 01:28:31,467
{\fs24}給我好好看著那個跛子
{\fs19}Keep an eye on that cripple all the time.

408
01:28:31,595 --> 01:28:33,137
{\fs24}知道了，弗蘭克
{\fs19}Sure, Frank.

409
01:30:05,063 --> 01:30:07,554
{\fs24}看到什麼人嗎？  沒有
{\fs19} See anyone?  No.

410
01:30:27,919 --> 01:30:29,711
{\fs24}就是他
{\fs19}There he is.

411
01:33:12,292 --> 01:33:14,783
{\fs24}你只知道怎麼開槍？
{\fs19}You only know how to shoot?

412
01:33:16,838 --> 01:33:18,961
{\fs24}你也知道該怎麼砍斷繩索吧？
{\fs19}Or do you know how to cut, too?

413
01:33:30,602 --> 01:33:33,010
{\fs24}嗨，你
{\fs19}You.

414
01:33:33,855 --> 01:33:35,599
{\fs24}等一下
{\fs19}Wait a minute.

415
01:33:36,358 --> 01:33:39,524
{\fs24}讓我們好好看看你
{\fs19}Let's have a good look at you.

416
01:33:51,081 --> 01:33:52,955
{\fs24}火車先生（兒語）
{\fs19}Mr Choo-Choo.

417
01:34:11,309 --> 01:34:14,892
{\fs24}找到你很容易，你這個混蛋
{\fs19}It's easy to find you. Bastard.

418
01:34:15,021 --> 01:34:17,310
{\fs24}我現在沒有必要殺你
{\fs19}I don't have to kill you now.

419
01:34:17,440 --> 01:34:19,813
{\fs24}你像蝸牛一樣留下粘液
{\fs19}You leave a slime behind you like a snail.

420
01:34:19,943 --> 01:34:24,023
{\fs24}兩條美麗的亮閃閃的鐵軌
{\fs19}Two beautiful shiny rails.

421
01:34:24,698 --> 01:34:26,240
{\fs24}還有另外一個混蛋
{\fs19}There's another bastard.

422
01:34:26,825 --> 01:34:29,363
{\fs24}他離我們越來越遠
{\fs19}And he's getting further away every minute.

423
01:34:42,007 --> 01:34:44,961
{\fs24}這就是了 你丈夫給我買的
{\fs19}There it is. What your husband ordered from me.

424
01:34:45,093 --> 01:34:49,173
{\fs24}他付了我現金， 現在都是屬於你的了
{\fs19}And seeing as how he paid cash, it all belongs to you.

425
01:34:49,306 --> 01:34:52,556
{\fs24}橡木，厚木板，櫸木，松木
{\fs19}Oak planks, beech, pine.

426
01:34:52,684 --> 01:34:54,724
{\fs24}都是一流的木材
{\fs19}All first-grade lumber.

427
01:34:54,853 --> 01:34:57,522
{\fs24}還有這些橫樑，路基
{\fs19}And there's beams and foundation pylons.

428
01:34:57,647 --> 01:35:01,724
{\fs24}十桶釘子，二十桶柏油，和所有的工具
{\fs19}Ten kegs of nails, 20 barrels of tar, and all these tools.

429
01:35:01,860 --> 01:35:04,268
{\fs24}也許他需要用這些來擴大農莊
{\fs19}Maybe he wanted to enlarge the farmhouse.

430
01:35:04,404 --> 01:35:06,313
{\fs24}擴大農莊？
{\fs19}Enlarge the farmhouse?

431
01:35:06,448 --> 01:35:09,651
{\fs24}他都可以建八個農莊了
{\fs19}He could have built at least eight of them.

432
01:35:09,784 --> 01:35:11,658
{\fs24}順便問一下，女士
{\fs19}By the way, ma'am,

433
01:35:11,786 --> 01:35:15,321
{\fs24}馬克貝恩還買了這個，說是很重要
{\fs19}McBain also ordered this. Said it was important.

434
01:35:15,457 --> 01:35:20,083
{\fs24}但是他好像忘記告訴我他想在上面刷什麼
{\fs19}Only it seems he forgot to tell me 
what he wanted printed on it.

435
01:35:27,344 --> 01:35:28,755
{\fs24}車站
{\fs19}Station.

436
01:35:29,763 --> 01:35:30,961
{\fs24}你說什麼？
{\fs19}How's that again?

437
01:35:31,097 --> 01:35:33,719
{\fs24}我說了，在上面刷「車站」
{\fs19}I said print "station".

438
01:36:05,632 --> 01:36:07,672
{\fs24}在找這個嗎?
{\fs19}Looking for this?

439
01:36:07,801 --> 01:36:10,802
{\fs24}我受夠了你的屠夫戰術
{\fs19}I've had enough of your butcher tactics.

440
01:36:10,929 --> 01:36:13,301
{\fs24}我知道那個女人在這兒
{\fs19}I know that woman is here.

441
01:36:13,431 --> 01:36:16,219
{\fs24}我不希望再有無謂的殘殺
{\fs19}I don't want any more useless killing.

442
01:36:16,351 --> 01:36:19,471
{\fs24}我想跟你買那塊地
{\fs19}I'm ready to make a deal for that land.

443
01:36:19,604 --> 01:36:21,727
{\fs24}付給你應得的那份
{\fs19}To pay what's necessary.

444
01:36:21,857 --> 01:36:24,264
{\fs24}我不想再浪費任何時間
{\fs19}I don't want to waste any more time.

445
01:36:25,235 --> 01:36:27,477
{\fs24}你犯了個大錯，莫頓
{\fs19}You've made a big mistake, Morton.

446
01:36:31,366 --> 01:36:35,578
{\fs24}你不在那列火車上時 你就像個縮頭烏龜一樣
{\fs19}When you're not on that train, 
you look like a turtle out of its shell.

447
01:36:36,371 --> 01:36:38,114
{\fs24}真有趣
{\fs19}Just funny.

448
01:36:38,248 --> 01:36:42,459
{\fs24}可憐的瘸子吹牛 所以沒有人知道你有多可怕
{\fs19}Poor cripple talking big so nobody'll 
know how scared you are.

449
01:36:42,586 --> 01:36:44,412
{\fs24}弗蘭克，我來這裡是跟你做交易的
{\fs19}I'm here to make a deal, Frank.

450
01:36:47,549 --> 01:36:50,005
{\fs24}我沒有時間跟你爭
{\fs19}I don't have time to compete with you.

451
01:36:55,724 --> 01:36:57,515
{\fs24}跟我爭？
{\fs19}Compete?

452
01:37:00,729 --> 01:37:06,103
{\fs24}為什麼？ 你你自己站都站不穩
{\fs19}Why, you You can't even stand 
on your own feet by yourself.

453
01:37:16,745 --> 01:37:19,414
{\fs24}這樣足夠證明你強壯了嗎？
{\fs19}Is that sufficient to make you feel stronger?

454
01:37:20,248 --> 01:37:23,498
{\fs24}我能把你像爛蘋果一樣壓扁
{\fs19}I could squash you like a wormy apple.

455
01:37:25,253 --> 01:37:28,338
{\fs24}當然，不過你不會那樣做
{\fs19}Sure, but you won't do it.

456
01:37:29,090 --> 01:37:32,376
{\fs24}因為那對你沒什麼好處
{\fs19}Because it's not to your advantage.

457
01:37:39,851 --> 01:37:42,852
{\fs24}不知道你還能用你那完好的腳走多遠
{\fs19}Who knows how far you'd have gone with two good legs.

458
01:37:51,029 --> 01:37:54,528
{\fs24}把他帶回火車，看著他
{\fs19}Help him back to the train. Keep your eye on him.

459
01:37:56,993 --> 01:37:59,864
{\fs24}莫頓 不用擔心那塊地
{\fs19}Morton. Don't worry about the land.

460
01:37:59,996 --> 01:38:02,452
{\fs24}如果你想付錢的話，你可以付
{\fs19}If you feel like paying for it, you can pay.

461
01:38:02,582 --> 01:38:06,283
{\fs24}這對你來說也沒有什麼區別 去跟新主人說吧
{\fs19}It won't make any difference to you, 
dealing with the new owner.

462
01:38:32,988 --> 01:38:35,823
{\fs24}夏恩！
{\fs19}Cheyenne!

463
01:38:35,949 --> 01:38:39,152
{\fs24}這裡有個方樹樁，上面寫著「水槽」
{\fs19}There's a square staked out here. It says "water tank".

464
01:38:39,286 --> 01:38:43,449
{\fs24}這裡也有一個，不過寫著「郵局」
{\fs19}Over here, too. Only, it says "post office".

465
01:38:43,582 --> 01:38:45,574
{\fs24}這個寫著「畜欄」
{\fs19}And this one says "corral".

466
01:38:45,709 --> 01:38:48,034
{\fs24}這裡寫著「教堂」
{\fs19}And this here "church".

467
01:38:48,628 --> 01:38:51,166
{\fs24}這些都他媽的是什麼東西？
{\fs19}What the hell is this?

468
01:38:51,298 --> 01:38:52,626
{\fs24}你難道看不出來嗎？
{\fs19}Can't you see?

469
01:38:53,884 --> 01:38:55,259
{\fs24}這是一個火車站
{\fs19}It's a station.

470
01:38:56,261 --> 01:38:59,048
{\fs24}所有圍繞它的是一個小鎮
{\fs19}And all around it, a town.

471
01:39:01,475 --> 01:39:03,681
{\fs24}布賴特.馬克貝恩的小鎮
{\fs19}Brett McBain's town.

472
01:39:05,979 --> 01:39:08,600
{\fs24}他瘋了！
{\fs19}Was he crazy!

473
01:39:08,732 --> 01:39:11,057
{\fs24}是呀，從某個特定的角度說
{\fs19}Yeah, in a very special way.

474
01:39:13,069 --> 01:39:15,145
{\fs24}一個愛爾蘭人
{\fs19}An lrishman.

475
01:39:16,490 --> 01:39:21,235
{\fs24}他知道經過石板鎮的鐵路會繼續往西去
{\fs19}He knew that railroad coming through 
Flagstone would continue on west.

476
01:39:21,369 --> 01:39:24,157
{\fs24}所以他研究了全國的情況來到了這裡
{\fs19}So he looked over all this country out here

477
01:39:24,289 --> 01:39:26,862
{\fs24}直到他發現了這片沙漠
{\fs19}until he found this hunk of desert.

478
01:39:27,792 --> 01:39:29,785
{\fs24}沒有人需要它
{\fs19}Nobody wanted it.

479
01:39:33,840 --> 01:39:35,085
{\fs24}但是他卻買了下來
{\fs19}But he bought it.

480
01:39:37,803 --> 01:39:42,299
{\fs24}然後縮衣節食的過了很多年，他在等待
{\fs19}Then he tightened his belt, and for years, he waited.

481
01:39:43,809 --> 01:39:45,848
{\fs24}他在等待什麼呢？
{\fs19}Waited for what?

482
01:39:47,270 --> 01:39:50,022
{\fs24}他在等待鐵路修到這裡
{\fs19}For the railroad to reach this point.

483
01:39:50,148 --> 01:39:55,569
{\fs24}可是他是怎麼知道鐵路一定會經過他的領地？
{\fs19}But how could he be sure the railroad 
would pass through his property?

484
01:39:57,155 --> 01:40:00,073
{\fs24}那些蒸汽機，運轉離不開水
{\fs19}Them steam engines can't roll without water.

485
01:40:00,200 --> 01:40:05,539
{\fs24}在石板鎮往西50英里以內 只有這裡有水
{\fs19}And the only water for 50 miles 
west of Flagstone is right here.

486
01:40:05,664 --> 01:40:06,826
{\fs24}在這片土地下面
{\fs19}Under this land.

487
01:40:07,958 --> 01:40:11,243
{\fs24}他不是個傻瓜，我們親愛的朋友
{\fs19}He was no fool, our dead friend.

488
01:40:11,378 --> 01:40:15,874
{\fs24}他打算用這塊沙漠換取相同重量的金子
{\fs19}He was going to sell this piece of 
desert for its weight in gold.

489
01:40:16,675 --> 01:40:19,510
{\fs24}你不會賣掉你畢生的夢想
{\fs19}You don't sell the dream of a lifetime.

490
01:40:21,138 --> 01:40:23,629
{\fs24}布賴特.馬克貝恩只是想要他的車站
{\fs19}Brett McBain wanted his station.

491
01:40:26,059 --> 01:40:28,348
{\fs24}他有權利建造它
{\fs19}He got the rights to build it.

492
01:40:30,605 --> 01:40:33,559
{\fs24}你是怎麼知道這些的？  我看過一份文件
{\fs19} How do you know all this?  I saw a document.

493
01:40:33,692 --> 01:40:36,776
{\fs24}一切都井井有條 圖章，簽字，所有一切
{\fs19}It was all in order. Seals, signatures, everything.

494
01:40:37,988 --> 01:40:39,316
{\fs24}只有一件東西
{\fs19}One thing, though.

495
01:40:39,447 --> 01:40:43,908
{\fs24}用很小的字寫的，是個簡短的條款。
{\fs19}In very small print, there is a short clause,

496
01:40:44,035 --> 01:40:47,903
{\fs24}說馬克貝恩或者他的繼承人會失去所有的權利
{\fs19}which says that McBain or his heirs lose all rights

497
01:40:48,039 --> 01:40:51,373
{\fs24}如果鐵路到達這個地方的時候
{\fs19}if, by the time the railroad reaches this point,

498
01:40:52,586 --> 01:40:54,744
{\fs24}車站還沒有建造好
{\fs19}..the station ain't built yet.

499
01:41:01,636 --> 01:41:05,848
{\fs24}說到鐵路，我想起了路匪
{\fs19}Speaking of railroads, I noticed the rail gang's already

500
01:41:09,436 --> 01:41:13,220
{\fs24}我注意到路匪早就藏在這些山的後面
{\fs19}I noticed the rail gang's already behind those hills.

501
01:41:13,356 --> 01:41:18,184
{\fs24}在你注意到這點之前，他們就會來到這裡
{\fs19}And before you know it, they're gonna be here.

502
01:41:18,320 --> 01:41:19,600
{\fs24}是啊
{\fs19}Yeah.

503
01:41:19,738 --> 01:41:21,113
{\fs24}是啊
{\fs19}Yeah.

504
01:41:22,199 --> 01:41:23,823
{\fs24}聽著
{\fs19}Listen.

505
01:41:24,576 --> 01:41:25,987
{\fs24}口琴家
{\fs19}Harmonica.

506
01:41:27,037 --> 01:41:30,203
{\fs24}一個小鎮要是建造在鐵路附近
{\fs19}A town built around the railroad.

507
01:41:31,958 --> 01:41:34,247
{\fs24}你就可以發財了
{\fs19}You could make a fortune.

508
01:41:35,295 --> 01:41:38,130
{\fs24}成百個一千美元
{\fs19}Hundreds of thousands of dollars.

509
01:41:39,299 --> 01:41:41,339
{\fs24}或者更多
{\fs19}More than that.

510
01:41:42,511 --> 01:41:45,002
{\fs24}成千個一千
{\fs19}Thousands of thousands.

511
01:41:45,847 --> 01:41:48,255
{\fs24}他們說那是上百萬
{\fs19}They call them millions.

512
01:41:49,392 --> 01:41:51,136
{\fs24}上百萬？
{\fs19}Millions?

513
01:41:53,980 --> 01:41:56,269
{\fs24}對，上百萬  是啊
{\fs19} Yeah, millions.  Yeah.

514
01:41:56,399 --> 01:42:01,227
{\fs24}我一直在想 跟聰明的女士做生意 會容易些
{\fs19}I always thought it'd be easier to 
make a deal with a smart lady.

515
01:42:01,363 --> 01:42:03,854
{\fs24}你所要做的就是
{\fs19}All you gotta do is

516
01:42:05,992 --> 01:42:09,326
{\fs24}你們他媽的都一個個杵在這裡做什麼？
{\fs19}What in the hell are you standing around for?

517
01:42:09,913 --> 01:42:12,036
{\fs24}頭兒，我們應該做什麼？
{\fs19}Chief, what are we supposed to do?

518
01:42:12,165 --> 01:42:14,372
{\fs24}你們應該做什麼？
{\fs19}What are you supposed to do?

519
01:42:14,501 --> 01:42:16,992
{\fs24}建造車站，笨蛋！
{\fs19}Build a station, idiots!

520
01:42:19,756 --> 01:42:22,294
{\fs24}我想她不一定會喜歡這個車站
{\fs19}I figure it ain't gonna look like much.

521
01:42:25,804 --> 01:42:30,265
{\fs24}當她回來時 這將是她所看見的第一件東西
{\fs19}But it'll be the first thing she sees when she gets back.

522
01:42:31,059 --> 01:42:33,301
{\fs24}如果她會回來的話
{\fs19}If she gets back.

523
01:43:52,766 --> 01:43:54,557
{\fs24}我想
{\fs19}I think

524
01:44:03,306 --> 01:44:04,930
{\fs24}是啊
{\fs19}Yeah.

525
01:44:05,892 --> 01:44:09,936
{\fs24}我想，如果殺了你的話我會很後悔
{\fs19}I'm beginning to think I might be a little sorry killing you.

526
01:44:11,898 --> 01:44:14,733
{\fs24}你喜歡活著
{\fs19}You like being alive.

527
01:44:27,872 --> 01:44:31,206
{\fs24}你也喜歡男人的手撫摸你的全身
{\fs19}You also like to feel a man's hands all over you.

528
01:44:33,044 --> 01:44:35,167
{\fs24}你喜歡這樣
{\fs19}You like it.

529
01:44:38,883 --> 01:44:42,548
{\fs24}甚至那是殺了你丈夫的那個男人的雙手
{\fs19}Even if they're the hands of 
the man who killed your husband.

530
01:45:02,740 --> 01:45:04,982
{\fs24}啊
{\fs19}What a

531
01:45:07,787 --> 01:45:09,863
{\fs24}真是個小騷貨
{\fs19}What a little tramp.

532
01:45:12,333 --> 01:45:16,912
{\fs24}這個世界上 妳沒有比保養皮膚更重要的事了？
{\fs19}Is there anything in the world 
you wouldn't do to save your skin?

533
01:45:20,341 --> 01:45:22,630
{\fs24}沒有了，弗蘭克。
{\fs19}Nothing, Frank.

534
01:45:45,867 --> 01:45:48,821
{\fs24}現在我明白了為什麼他們那麼想念你
{\fs19}Now I understand why they miss you so much

535
01:45:50,246 --> 01:45:54,030
{\fs24}在那裡，在新奧爾良
{\fs19}..down there in New Orleans.

536
01:45:56,794 --> 01:45:59,285
{\fs24}偉大的發明，電報
{\fs19}Great invention, the telegraph.

537
01:46:02,884 --> 01:46:05,671
{\fs24}「吉兒？那個深色皮膚的女人？」
{\fs19}"Jill? The brunette?"

538
01:46:06,220 --> 01:46:10,514
{\fs24}「波旁街上妓院裡的那個 最有紳士風度的客人
{\fs19}"The customers of the most elegant 
whorehouse on Bourbon Street

539
01:46:10,641 --> 01:46:13,761
{\fs24}自從她離開了之後，一直傷心哭泣
{\fs19}have been weeping ever since she left."

540
01:46:16,189 --> 01:46:18,228
{\fs24}說，告訴我
{\fs19}Say, tell me.

541
01:46:19,233 --> 01:46:21,309
{\fs24}老馬克貝恩知道這些嗎？
{\fs19}Did old McBain know?

542
01:46:22,028 --> 01:46:24,067
{\fs24}當然
{\fs19}Yeah.

543
01:46:24,197 --> 01:46:26,522
{\fs24}當然，我打賭他知道
{\fs19}Yeah, I bet he did.

544
01:46:26,658 --> 01:46:29,742
{\fs24}只有他才是那種跟妓女結婚的人
{\fs19}He was just the type to marry a whore.

545
01:46:35,375 --> 01:46:37,581
{\fs24}我有個好主意
{\fs19}It's an idea.

546
01:46:39,504 --> 01:46:41,543
{\fs24}我可以跟你結婚
{\fs19}I could marry you.

547
01:46:42,548 --> 01:46:45,039
{\fs24}不過那塊土地要屬於我
{\fs19}And the land would become mine.

548
01:46:45,802 --> 01:46:47,711
{\fs24}或許
{\fs19}And maybe

549
01:46:49,847 --> 01:46:52,385
{\fs24}或許你能成為一個完美的妻子
{\fs19}..you'd make a perfect wife.

550
01:46:56,104 --> 01:46:59,722
{\fs24}不過我不會是一個好丈夫
{\fs19}It would be me who wouldn't be any good as a husband.

551
01:47:01,484 --> 01:47:03,311
{\fs24}太壞了
{\fs19}Too bad.

552
01:47:03,444 --> 01:47:06,944
{\fs24}我們必須另外想出一個解決的辦法
{\fs19}We'll have to think of another solution.

553
01:47:07,073 --> 01:47:08,697
{\fs24}更簡單
{\fs19}Simpler.

554
01:47:13,579 --> 01:47:15,619
{\fs24}更快捷
{\fs19}Quicker.

555
01:47:36,561 --> 01:47:39,052
{\fs24}作為本郡的行政長官
{\fs19}As sheriff of this county,

556
01:47:39,188 --> 01:47:42,474
{\fs24}我被邀請主持這次拍賣
{\fs19}I've been asked to preside over the sale by auction

557
01:47:42,608 --> 01:47:47,105
{\fs24}所有屬於吉兒.馬克貝恩夫人的財產
{\fs19}of all property belonging to 
Mrs Jill McBain, here present.

558
01:47:47,780 --> 01:47:51,149
{\fs24}這片土地總共320英畝
{\fs19}This parcel of land measures 320 acres.

559
01:47:51,284 --> 01:47:55,578
{\fs24}沒有任何糾紛，留置權和抵押
{\fs19}It's free of all encumbrances, liens and mortgages.

560
01:47:56,497 --> 01:47:58,620
{\fs24}這塊地及其所含
{\fs19}This property and all it contains,

561
01:47:58,750 --> 01:48:01,075
{\fs24}所有的資產
{\fs19}Iock, stock and barrel,

562
01:48:01,210 --> 01:48:04,710
{\fs24}都將在成交之時過戶給幸運的買主
{\fs19}will be turned over to the lucky 
purchaser at the time of sale.

563
01:48:04,839 --> 01:48:07,460
{\fs24}所有的東西都編號排列在
{\fs19}All the contents therein are listed by number

564
01:48:07,592 --> 01:48:10,546
{\fs24}分發給你們的存貨表格上
{\fs19}on the inventory sheet distributed among you.

565
01:48:10,678 --> 01:48:14,593
{\fs24}全部財產將捆綁賣給出價最高的投標人
{\fs19}The entire property will be sold 
in block to the highest bidder.

566
01:48:14,724 --> 01:48:17,678
{\fs24}好了。大家都明白了吧
{\fs19}Alright. That's clear to everybody.

567
01:48:17,810 --> 01:48:19,637
{\fs24}我宣佈拍賣開始
{\fs19}I declare the auction open.

568
01:48:19,771 --> 01:48:22,606
{\fs24}現在，誰第一個競拍？
{\fs19}Now, who's going to make the first bid?

569
01:48:27,362 --> 01:48:31,490
{\fs24}所有物品的清單 有些東西還是很值錢的
{\fs19}A list of all the items. Some of them are worth money.

570
01:48:32,575 --> 01:48:36,110
{\fs24}好了，現在 誰第一個競拍？
{\fs19}Alright. Now, who's going to make the first bid?

571
01:48:40,375 --> 01:48:42,616
{\fs24}200美元
{\fs19}$200.

572
01:48:42,752 --> 01:48:45,243
{\fs24}好，我們有人出價200美元
{\fs19}Well, I have an opening bid of $200.

573
01:48:46,005 --> 01:48:49,255
{\fs24}200美元。有沒有更多的？
{\fs19}$200. Do I hear more?

574
01:48:49,384 --> 01:48:53,512
{\fs24}那塊臭地不值那麼多錢
{\fs19}That stinking piece of land ain't worth it.

575
01:48:53,638 --> 01:48:56,639
{\fs24}哦，朋友，200美元
{\fs19}Come on, my friends, $200.

576
01:48:56,766 --> 01:48:59,886
{\fs24}那些牲畜就值兩倍的價錢
{\fs19}The livestock alone is worth twice that much.

577
01:49:01,354 --> 01:49:03,097
{\fs24}那麼
{\fs19}Well

578
01:49:04,107 --> 01:49:06,313
{\fs24}有人出300美元嗎？
{\fs19}Who's going to bid $300?

579
01:49:10,446 --> 01:49:15,357
{\fs24}現在，朋友們 我知道我們不是在拍賣加州
{\fs19}Now, look, friends, I realise 
we're not offering California here,

580
01:49:15,493 --> 01:49:18,743
{\fs24}但是200美元對於這塊土地也太少了點
{\fs19}but 200 is damn little for all that property.

581
01:49:18,871 --> 01:49:22,952
{\fs24}女士們，先生們，我不會接受200美元的押金
{\fs19}Ladies and gentlemen, I wouldn't 
even take 200 as a deposit.

582
01:49:26,212 --> 01:49:29,546
{\fs24}嗯，沒有人再加價了嗎？
{\fs19}Well, nobody's going to bid it up.

583
01:49:37,473 --> 01:49:40,427
{\fs24}你確信你不需要設一個最低競價嗎？
{\fs19}You're sure you wouldn't want to set a minimum price?

584
01:49:42,895 --> 01:49:45,137
{\fs24}我希望我是錯的，馬克貝恩夫人
{\fs19}I wish I were wrong, Mrs McBain,

585
01:49:45,273 --> 01:49:49,484
{\fs24}但是你有義務結束這次拍賣，就算賣得很便宜
{\fs19}but you're liable to end up 
selling the place for a plate of beans.

586
01:49:55,325 --> 01:49:57,364
{\fs24}我只想把它賣了
{\fs19}All I want is to sell.

587
01:51:04,811 --> 01:51:08,227
{\fs24}你真胖  如果你那麼說
{\fs19} You're fat.  If you say so.

588
01:51:08,356 --> 01:51:10,064
{\fs24}多少？  一張牌
{\fs19} How many?  One card.

589
01:51:12,318 --> 01:51:14,525
{\fs24}給我一張
{\fs19}One for me.

590
01:51:16,989 --> 01:51:18,899
{\fs24}莊家拿三張
{\fs19}Dealer takes three.

591
01:51:29,585 --> 01:51:32,836
{\fs24}我能加入嗎？
{\fs19}Can I take a hand?

592
01:51:38,052 --> 01:51:39,594
{\fs19}1 5.

593
01:51:52,483 --> 01:51:55,105
{\fs24}行啊，坐下
{\fs19}Yeah, sit down.

594
01:52:18,843 --> 01:52:20,717
{\fs24}我做莊
{\fs19}I'll deal.

595
01:54:04,866 --> 01:54:07,617
{\fs24}你怎麼
{\fs19}How do you

596
01:54:07,744 --> 01:54:10,614
{\fs24}你怎麼玩法, 莫頓先生
{\fs19}How do you play this game, Mr Morton?

597
01:54:13,115 --> 01:54:15,357
{\fs24}很簡單
{\fs19}It's very simple.

598
01:54:16,285 --> 01:54:21,161
{\fs24}只要用腦子，你就不會輸
{\fs19}As long as you use your head, you never lose.

599
01:54:21,791 --> 01:54:24,626
{\fs24}500美元
{\fs19}$500.

600
01:54:28,965 --> 01:54:31,171
{\fs24}500美元
{\fs19}$500.

601
01:54:32,343 --> 01:54:34,585
{\fs24}還有沒有更高的價錢？
{\fs19}Do I hear any other bids?

602
01:54:36,639 --> 01:54:39,130
{\fs24}沒有了
{\fs19}I don't think so.

603
01:54:48,150 --> 01:54:49,479
{\fs24}對不起，馬克貝恩夫人
{\fs19}I'm sorry, Mrs McBain,

604
01:54:49,610 --> 01:54:54,521
{\fs24}但是我想我要最後敲定價錢了
{\fs19}but I think I'm gonna have to knock down on that last bid.

605
01:55:05,751 --> 01:55:08,207
{\fs24}500美元一次
{\fs19}$500 once.

606
01:55:10,631 --> 01:55:13,336
{\fs24}500美元兩次
{\fs19}$500 twice.

607
01:55:15,887 --> 01:55:18,009
{\fs24}500美元  5000美元
{\fs19} $500  $5,000.

608
01:55:41,746 --> 01:55:47,036
{\fs24}是你說5000美元嗎？  他來了
{\fs19} You said $5,000?  It's on its way.

609
01:55:59,430 --> 01:56:02,265
{\fs24}那是夏恩
{\fs19}It's Cheyenne!

610
01:56:10,816 --> 01:56:14,150
{\fs24}這個傢伙值5000美元賞金，對嗎？
{\fs19}The reward for this man is $5,000, that's right?

611
01:56:14,278 --> 01:56:18,987
{\fs24}猶大滿足於4,970美元或更少
{\fs19}Judas was content with $4,970 less.

612
01:56:19,116 --> 01:56:21,607
{\fs24}那個時候他們不用美元
{\fs19}There were no dollars in them days.

613
01:56:23,663 --> 01:56:26,118
{\fs24}但是他奶奶的，是啊
{\fs19}But sons of bitches, yeah.

614
01:56:40,471 --> 01:56:42,760
{\fs24}等一下
{\fs19}Wait a minute.

615
01:56:44,433 --> 01:56:47,684
{\fs24}監獄在那邊  是啊，我知道
{\fs19} The jail's that way.  Yeah, I know.

616
01:56:47,812 --> 01:56:51,347
{\fs24}是啊，但是你在去火車站
{\fs19}Yeah, but you're going to the railroad station.

617
01:56:52,066 --> 01:56:54,771
{\fs24}我要送你去尤馬, 夏恩
{\fs19}I'm sending you to Yuma, Cheyenne.

618
01:56:54,902 --> 01:56:56,895
{\fs24}那兒有座現代化的監獄
{\fs19}They got a modern jail there.

619
01:56:57,029 --> 01:57:01,857
{\fs24}那裡有更多的牆，更多的柵欄 和更多的侍衛
{\fs19}It's got more walls, more bars, more guards.

620
01:57:01,993 --> 01:57:05,990
{\fs24}你會喜歡的，在那裡20年，你會知道的
{\fs19}You'll like it, in 20 years. You'll see.

621
01:58:07,558 --> 01:58:10,974
{\fs24}兩張票，朋友，去下一站
{\fs19}Two tickets, amigo, to the next station.

622
01:58:11,103 --> 01:58:13,226
{\fs24}單程
{\fs19}One way only.

623
01:58:15,149 --> 01:58:18,103
{\fs24}這是給你的 祝賀你
{\fs19}Here's to you. And congratulations.

624
01:58:22,907 --> 01:58:25,149
{\fs24}你做了個好買賣
{\fs19}You got yourself a good deal.

625
01:58:26,619 --> 01:58:27,899
{\fs24}拍賣
{\fs19}The auction.

626
01:58:28,996 --> 01:58:32,365
{\fs24}忘了他吧，我沒有投資那塊地
{\fs19}Forget it. I don't invest in land.

627
01:58:34,502 --> 01:58:39,128
{\fs24}你一點也不像個高尚 保護可憐無助的寡婦的人
{\fs19}You don't look at all like the noble 
defender of poor defenceless widows.

628
01:58:41,175 --> 01:58:43,132
{\fs24}不過，也是
{\fs19}But then again,

629
01:58:46,138 --> 01:58:49,554
{\fs24}我也不像一個可憐無助的寡婦
{\fs19}..I don't look like a poor defenceless widow.

630
01:58:56,065 --> 01:58:59,019
{\fs24}夏恩是對的， 你是一個不平常的女人
{\fs19}Cheyenne's right. You're a remarkable woman.

631
01:59:00,069 --> 01:59:02,394
{\fs24}你是一個不平常的男人
{\fs19}And you're a remarkable man.

632
01:59:02,530 --> 01:59:05,199
{\fs24}但是你現在已經想到什麼了
{\fs19}But you have something on your mind.

633
01:59:11,622 --> 01:59:14,493
{\fs24}你想到什麼了？
{\fs19}Have you got something on your mind?

634
01:59:17,128 --> 01:59:20,912
{\fs24}熱水 滿滿一澡盆熱水
{\fs19}Hot water. A bathtub full of hot water.

635
01:59:39,567 --> 01:59:42,437
{\fs24}我想是時候了 我去放水
{\fs19}I think it's time I filled that bathtub.

636
02:00:13,893 --> 02:00:15,885
{\fs24}你是誰？
{\fs19}Who are you?

637
02:00:36,290 --> 02:00:38,579
{\fs24}吉姆.庫珀
{\fs19}Jim Cooper.

638
02:00:38,709 --> 02:00:40,417
{\fs24}查克.揚不拉德
{\fs19}Chuck Youngblood.

639
02:00:41,337 --> 02:00:43,164
{\fs24}多一個死人
{\fs19}More dead men.

640
02:00:46,634 --> 02:00:49,469
{\fs24}要不是遇見了你，他們都還活著，弗蘭克
{\fs19}They were all alive until they met you, Frank.

641
02:00:55,810 --> 02:00:59,475
{\fs24}你為那屬於我的東西付了5000美元
{\fs19}You paid $5,000 for something that belongs to me.

642
02:01:04,277 --> 02:01:06,565
{\fs19}5,000
5,000

643
02:01:10,616 --> 02:01:12,905
{\fs24}加上一塊錢
{\fs19}..plus one.

644
02:01:17,874 --> 02:01:20,162
{\fs24}你也有權利得到一點利潤
{\fs19}You've got a right to make a profit, too.

645
02:01:46,903 --> 02:01:50,236
{\fs24}如果我是你的話，我不會想太久
{\fs19}I wouldn't take too long thinking about it, if I were you.

646
02:01:54,577 --> 02:01:57,578
{\fs24}你把自己捲入了自己能力之外的事情
{\fs19}You got yourself into something bigger than you.

647
02:01:57,705 --> 02:02:00,576
{\fs24}你現在有機會全身而退，最好收下
{\fs19}You got a chance to get out easy. You better take it.

648
02:02:00,708 --> 02:02:03,911
{\fs24}你像一個真正的生意人，弗蘭克
{\fs19}You sound like a real businessman, Frank.

649
02:02:04,045 --> 02:02:07,211
{\fs24}跟莫頓先生在一起對你很有幫助
{\fs19}Being with Mr Morton's done you a lot of good.

650
02:02:15,514 --> 02:02:18,184
{\fs24}而且你還學到一些新方法
{\fs19}And you've learned some new methods.

651
02:02:19,435 --> 02:02:22,222
{\fs24}是的，莫頓先生教了我很多新的方法
{\fs19}Yeah, Mr Morton has shown you a lot of new ways.

652
02:02:26,984 --> 02:02:29,606
{\fs24}雖然你還沒有放棄你的老方法
{\fs19}Even though you haven't given up the old ones.

653
02:02:31,072 --> 02:02:34,156
{\fs24}任選一種你喜歡的方法 做完這宗買賣
{\fs19}Pick any method you like. Just make the deal.

654
02:02:36,619 --> 02:02:38,243
{\fs24}哪一宗買賣，弗蘭克
{\fs19}Which deal, Frank?

655
02:02:40,915 --> 02:02:43,204
{\fs24}我們不止一宗，你我之間
{\fs19}We have more than one, you and me.

656
02:02:47,088 --> 02:02:52,462
{\fs24}我們可以把它們捆在一起，一起解決
{\fs19}We can lump them together into 
one bundle, settle all of them.

657
02:02:52,593 --> 02:02:54,835
{\fs24}就這兒，現在
{\fs19}Here and now.

658
02:02:56,973 --> 02:02:58,681
{\fs24}放鬆，弗蘭克
{\fs19}Easy, Frank.

659
02:02:59,267 --> 02:03:00,809
{\fs24}放鬆
{\fs19}Easy.

660
02:03:01,477 --> 02:03:03,683
{\fs24}你要學習如何解決問題
{\fs19}You gotta learn not to push things.

661
02:03:03,813 --> 02:03:06,979
{\fs24}放輕鬆是一個生意人必須作的第一件事
{\fs19}Taking it easy is the first thing a businessman should do.

662
02:03:10,236 --> 02:03:13,901
{\fs24}我有個主意 莫頓先生能教你更多的東西
{\fs19}I got an idea Mr Morton can teach you a lot more.

663
02:03:18,494 --> 02:03:20,202
{\fs24}多少錢？
{\fs19}How much?

664
02:03:20,913 --> 02:03:21,992
{\fs24}一塊錢
{\fs19}One dollar.

665
02:04:27,480 --> 02:04:29,104
{\fs24}駕！
{\fs19}Giddy up!

666
02:06:03,451 --> 02:06:04,826
{\fs24}駕！
{\fs19}Giddy up!

667
02:07:08,641 --> 02:07:11,761
{\fs24}我發誓我們會聽到那種奇怪的聲音
{\fs19}I'd swear we're going to have that strange sound.

668
02:07:11,894 --> 02:07:12,808
{\fs24}現在
{\fs19}Right now.

669
02:09:05,800 --> 02:09:07,757
{\fs24}時間過得真快
{\fs19}Time sure flies.

670
02:09:09,011 --> 02:09:11,502
{\fs24}已經過了12點了
{\fs19}It's already past 1 2.

671
02:10:10,281 --> 02:10:12,606
{\fs24}但是他們是他的人
{\fs19}But they were his men.

672
02:10:12,742 --> 02:10:15,114
{\fs24}是啊  他們想要殺了他
{\fs19} Yeah.  And they tried to kill him.

673
02:10:15,244 --> 02:10:17,486
{\fs24}有人出更高的價
{\fs19}They found somebody who pays better.

674
02:10:17,622 --> 02:10:21,322
{\fs24}你！你卻救了他
{\fs19}And you! You saved his life.

675
02:10:23,502 --> 02:10:26,503
{\fs24}我只是不讓他們殺他 那不是一回事
{\fs19}I didn't let them kill him. That's not the same thing.

676
02:10:39,518 --> 02:10:41,595
{\fs24}對
{\fs19}Sure.

677
02:10:41,729 --> 02:10:44,101
{\fs24}那不是一回事
{\fs19}It's not the same thing.

678
02:10:51,197 --> 02:10:52,940
{\fs24}你快穿好衣服
{\fs19}You get dressed.

679
02:10:53,074 --> 02:10:54,319
{\fs24}是時候回家了
{\fs19}It's time to go home.

680
02:16:14,395 --> 02:16:15,937
{\fs24}煮咖啡了嗎？
{\fs19}Did you make coffee?

681
02:16:17,607 --> 02:16:19,683
{\fs24}這次我煮了
{\fs19}This time I did.

682
02:16:59,315 --> 02:17:01,557
{\fs24}味道很好
{\fs19}Good.

683
02:17:03,444 --> 02:17:06,528
{\fs24}我母親就是這樣煮咖啡的
{\fs19}My mother used to make coffee this way.

684
02:17:07,406 --> 02:17:11,985
{\fs24}熱熱的，濃濃的，而且味道很好
{\fs19}Hot, strong and good.

685
02:17:21,546 --> 02:17:23,253
{\fs24}夏恩
{\fs19}Cheyenne.

686
02:17:25,466 --> 02:17:27,755
{\fs24}他在那裡等什麼？
{\fs19}What's he waiting for out there?

687
02:17:30,429 --> 02:17:31,425
{\fs24}他在做什麼？
{\fs19}What's he doing?

688
02:17:37,520 --> 02:17:39,762
{\fs24}他在削一塊木頭
{\fs19}He's whittling on a piece of wood.

689
02:17:42,233 --> 02:17:45,483
{\fs24}我有預感當他削完的時候
{\fs19}I got a feeling when he stops whittling,

690
02:17:46,779 --> 02:17:48,855
{\fs24}會有什麼事情發生
{\fs19}..something's gonna happen.

691
02:18:57,350 --> 02:18:59,176
{\fs24}見到我很吃驚嗎？
{\fs19}Surprised to see me here?

692
02:19:01,229 --> 02:19:03,268
{\fs24}我知道你會來的
{\fs19}I knew you'd come.

693
02:19:26,754 --> 02:19:29,708
{\fs24}莫頓曾經跟我說過 我永遠都不會跟他一樣
{\fs19}Morton once told me I could never be like him.

694
02:19:31,092 --> 02:19:33,334
{\fs24}現在我知道為什麼了
{\fs19}Now I understand why.

695
02:19:35,179 --> 02:19:39,473
{\fs24}如果沒有去找他 你就會知道你還是屬於某個地方
{\fs19}Wouldn't have bothered him, knowing you were around somewhere alive.

696
02:19:40,726 --> 02:19:44,558
{\fs24}所以你發現你根本就不是一個生意人？
{\fs19}So you found out you're not a businessman after all?

697
02:19:44,689 --> 02:19:46,812
{\fs24}只是一個人而已
{\fs19}Just a man.

698
02:19:48,192 --> 02:19:50,434
{\fs24}一個古老的人種
{\fs19}An ancient race.

699
02:19:56,158 --> 02:20:01,070
{\fs24}其他的莫頓們會過來，他們會把它消滅
{\fs19}Other Mortons will be along and they'll kill it off.

700
02:20:01,205 --> 02:20:03,328
{\fs24}未來跟我們無關
{\fs19}The future don't matter to us.

701
02:20:03,457 --> 02:20:05,035
{\fs24}現在也無關
{\fs19}Nothing matters now.

702
02:20:05,167 --> 02:20:08,501
{\fs24}不為土地，不為錢，也不為女人
{\fs19}Not the land, not the money, not the woman.

703
02:20:09,130 --> 02:20:11,169
{\fs24}我來這裡是要找你
{\fs19}I came here to see you.

704
02:20:13,467 --> 02:20:16,587
{\fs24}因為我知道你現在會告訴我你在尋找什麼？
{\fs19}Cos I know that now you'll tell me what you're after.

705
02:20:31,777 --> 02:20:34,613
{\fs24}只有在死亡的那一刻
{\fs19}Only at the point of dying.

706
02:20:37,491 --> 02:20:39,614
{\fs24}我知道
{\fs19}I know.

707
02:21:23,287 --> 02:21:26,905
{\fs24}我為你熱了一些水，我還找到一個剃刀
{\fs19}I heated some water for you. I also found a razor.

708
02:21:27,959 --> 02:21:29,998
{\fs24}放在那兒好了
{\fs19}Put it there, please.

709
02:21:32,713 --> 02:21:36,332
{\fs24}我可以在剃鬍子的時候看著到火車開過來
{\fs19}So I can watch the railroad move up while I shave.

710
02:21:42,515 --> 02:21:43,890
{\fs24}你知道嗎？
{\fs19}You know what?

711
02:21:45,643 --> 02:21:49,593
{\fs24}如果我是你，我就會下去給那些人一些水喝
{\fs19}If I was you, I'd go down there 
and give those boys a drink.

712
02:21:58,197 --> 02:22:01,068
{\fs24}你不能想像
{\fs19}You can't imagine

713
02:22:01,200 --> 02:22:04,949
{\fs24}能看到你這樣的女人會讓男人有多麼高興
{\fs19}how happy it makes a man to see a woman like you.

714
02:22:06,747 --> 02:22:09,036
{\fs24}只是看著她
{\fs19}Just to look at her.

715
02:22:12,211 --> 02:22:15,912
{\fs24}如果其中有人在後面拍你
{\fs19}And if one of them should pat your behind,

716
02:22:17,508 --> 02:22:20,177
{\fs24}就裝作什麼都沒有
{\fs19}..just make believe it's nothing.

717
02:22:22,847 --> 02:22:25,005
{\fs24}他們值得那個
{\fs19}They earned it.

718
02:26:58,915 --> 02:27:01,203
{\fs24}讓你親愛的兄弟高興
{\fs19}Keep your loving brother happy.

719
02:30:20,449 --> 02:30:22,442
{\fs24}你是誰？
{\fs19}Who are you?

720
02:31:32,480 --> 02:31:34,188
{\fs24}你是個英俊的男人
{\fs19}You're sort of a handsome man.

721
02:31:37,401 --> 02:31:39,394
{\fs24}但是我不是那個人
{\fs19}But I'm not the right man.

722
02:31:52,333 --> 02:31:54,207
{\fs24}他也不是
{\fs19}And neither is he.

723
02:31:56,837 --> 02:31:58,830
{\fs24}或許不是
{\fs19}Maybe not.

724
02:31:58,965 --> 02:32:01,041
{\fs24}但是那不重要了
{\fs19}But it doesn't matter.

725
02:32:04,637 --> 02:32:07,424
{\fs24}你不明白，吉兒
{\fs19}You don't understand, Jill.

726
02:32:08,057 --> 02:32:10,928
{\fs24}那樣的人總是有些東西藏在心裡
{\fs19}People like that have something inside.

727
02:32:13,604 --> 02:32:15,811
{\fs24}一些跟死亡有關的東西
{\fs19}Something to do with death.

728
02:32:19,777 --> 02:32:23,857
{\fs24}如果那個傢伙還活著，他會從那扇門進來
{\fs19}If that fella lives, he'll come in through that door,

729
02:32:23,990 --> 02:32:27,109
{\fs24}拿起他的行李說再見
{\fs19}pick up his gear and say adios.

730
02:32:32,540 --> 02:32:35,790
{\fs24}能看到這個小鎮建成真得很好
{\fs19}It would be nice to see this town grow.

731
02:34:07,009 --> 02:34:09,335
{\fs24}現在我要走了
{\fs19}Now I gotta go.

732
02:34:54,682 --> 02:34:57,968
{\fs24}這裡將成為一個美麗的小鎮，甜水
{\fs19}Gonna be a beautiful town, Sweetwater.

733
02:35:02,940 --> 02:35:05,265
{\fs24}我希望你將來能回來
{\fs19}I hope you'll come back someday.

734
02:35:23,044 --> 02:35:24,871
{\fs24}將來
{\fs19}Someday.

735
02:35:36,641 --> 02:35:40,306
{\fs24}是啊，我也要走了
{\fs19}Yeah. I gotta go, too.

736
02:36:06,504 --> 02:36:08,580
{\fs24}讓人們相信什麼都沒有發生過
{\fs19}Make believe it's nothing.

737
02:38:14,173 --> 02:38:16,213
{\fs24}對不起，口琴家
{\fs19}Sorry, Harmonica.

738
02:38:16,342 --> 02:38:18,299
{\fs24}我要留在這裡了
{\fs19}I gotta stay here.

739
02:38:56,549 --> 02:38:58,008
{\fs24}誰幹的？
{\fs19}Who?

740
02:39:01,304 --> 02:39:03,877
{\fs24}我遇到了火車先生
{\fs19}I ran into Mr Choo-Choo.

741
02:39:04,765 --> 02:39:08,134
{\fs24}我沒有考慮到火車上那個廢人
{\fs19}I didn't count on that half-man from the train.

742
02:39:09,020 --> 02:39:10,929
{\fs24}他看起來很害怕
{\fs19}He got scared.

743
02:39:29,248 --> 02:39:31,205
{\fs24}口琴家
{\fs19}Harmonica.

744
02:39:32,168 --> 02:39:34,207
{\fs24}當他們射中你的時候
{\fs19}When they do you in,

745
02:39:34,337 --> 02:39:37,254
{\fs24}真希望那傢伙知道該往哪兒打
{\fs19}pray it's somebody who knows where to shoot.

746
02:39:52,939 --> 02:39:54,101
{\fs24}走開
{\fs19}Go away.

747
02:39:56,526 --> 02:39:58,981
{\fs24}走開
{\fs19}Go away.

748
02:39:59,111 --> 02:40:02,112
{\fs24}走開 我不希望你看著我死
{\fs19}Go away. I don't want you to see me die.
