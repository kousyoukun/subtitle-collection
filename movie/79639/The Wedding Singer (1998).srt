00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:23,899
All right, everybody, come on.

3
00:00:23,899 --> 00:00:25,818
Out on the dance floor.

4
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,654
Look at the happy couple.

5
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:31,490
No exceptions.
Up out of your chairs.

6
00:00:38,038 --> 00:00:41,000
I can feel
all the happiness in here.

7
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,045
All right!

8
00:00:47,131 --> 00:00:49,091
Look at him go.

9
00:00:50,342 --> 00:00:51,802
If I...

10
00:00:51,844 --> 00:00:56,599
I get to know your name...

11
00:00:57,683 --> 00:01:00,061
If I...

12
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:05,441
Could trace
your private number, baby...

13
00:01:05,483 --> 00:01:07,651
All I know is that to me...

14
00:01:07,693 --> 00:01:09,320
You look like
you're lots of fun.

15
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:11,322
Open up them lovin' arms.

16
00:01:11,363 --> 00:01:14,033
I want some, want some.

17
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:17,703
I set my sights on you.

18
00:01:17,745 --> 00:01:20,498
And no one else will do.

19
00:01:20,539 --> 00:01:22,166
And I...

20
00:01:22,208 --> 00:01:28,005
I got to have my way now, baby.

21
00:01:28,047 --> 00:01:30,424
All I know is that to me...

22
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:32,259
You look like
you're lots of fun.

23
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:33,928
Open up them lovin' arms.

24
00:01:33,969 --> 00:01:36,389
Watch out, here I come.

25
00:01:36,472 --> 00:01:40,184
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

26
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:41,727
Like a record, baby...

27
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:44,063
Right round, round, round.

28
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,817
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

29
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:49,276
Like a record, baby...

30
00:01:49,318 --> 00:01:51,904
Right round, round, round.

31
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:54,448
Somebody get some pants
on that kid.

32
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:00,955
If I...

33
00:02:00,996 --> 00:02:03,082
I got to be your friend...

34
00:02:03,124 --> 00:02:06,085
Grandma Molly,
I'm talking to you.

35
00:02:06,127 --> 00:02:08,587
And I...

36
00:02:08,629 --> 00:02:14,093
Would like to move in
just a little bit closer.

37
00:02:14,093 --> 00:02:15,928
All I know is that to me...

38
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,847
You look like
you're lots of fun.

39
00:02:17,847 --> 00:02:19,849
Open up your lovin' arms.

40
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:22,143
Watch out, here I come.

41
00:02:22,184 --> 00:02:25,855
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

42
00:02:25,896 --> 00:02:26,981
Like a record, baby...

43
00:02:27,022 --> 00:02:29,483
Right round, round, round.

44
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:33,446
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

45
00:02:33,446 --> 00:02:35,322
Like a record, baby.

46
00:02:35,364 --> 00:02:42,747
I want your love.

47
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:51,714
Uncle Marty!

48
00:02:51,797 --> 00:02:54,008
All I know is that to me...

49
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:55,801
You look like
you're lots of fun.

50
00:02:55,885 --> 00:02:57,553
Open up your lovin' arms.

51
00:02:57,595 --> 00:02:59,972
Watch out, here I come.

52
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:03,893
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

53
00:03:03,934 --> 00:03:05,311
Like a record, baby...

54
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:07,730
Right round, round, round.

55
00:03:07,772 --> 00:03:11,442
You spin me right round,
baby, right round...

56
00:03:11,484 --> 00:03:12,985
Like a record, baby...

57
00:03:13,027 --> 00:03:14,653
Right round, round, round.

58
00:03:14,695 --> 00:03:18,074
You spin me round...

59
00:03:18,074 --> 00:03:19,075
And round...

60
00:03:19,075 --> 00:03:21,410
And round.

61
00:03:21,410 --> 00:03:22,745
Very nice.

62
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:26,665
Good job, lady.
You were shakin'.

63
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,795
It is gonna be fun today.

64
00:03:30,836 --> 00:03:33,672
The best man's gonna come up
and say a few words...

65
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,884
so let's put our hands together
for the groom's brother David.

66
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,013
All right, Dave.

67
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,069
When my brother Harold
asked me to be the best man...

68
00:03:55,111 --> 00:03:58,823
I was like,
"Whoa, of course, man...

69
00:03:58,864 --> 00:04:00,616
"because you've always
been there for me."

70
00:04:02,284 --> 00:04:06,247
Like when I was in rehab...

71
00:04:06,288 --> 00:04:08,874
and like the time
I couldn't find my car.

72
00:04:10,126 --> 00:04:13,754
'Cause, Harold, he's always been
the dependable one.

73
00:04:13,796 --> 00:04:17,425
I've always been
the screwed-up one. Right, Dad?

74
00:04:19,969 --> 00:04:22,638
"Why can't you
be more like your brother?

75
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,516
"Harold would never
beat up his landlord."

76
00:04:27,143 --> 00:04:29,603
He's drunk as shit.

77
00:04:33,274 --> 00:04:34,734
But...

78
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:35,818
a little news flash, Pop.

79
00:04:37,445 --> 00:04:38,779
Harold ain't so perfect.

80
00:04:40,239 --> 00:04:42,199
Remember that time
in Puerto Rico...

81
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:45,119
when we picked up those two...

82
00:04:45,161 --> 00:04:47,788
I guess they were prostitutes,
but I don't remember paying.

83
00:04:47,872 --> 00:04:49,373
How about that?

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,126
Terrific.

85
00:04:52,168 --> 00:04:53,919
I'm a person, too,
Pop, goddamn it!

86
00:04:55,129 --> 00:04:56,505
You're a moron!

87
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:01,135
The best man, everybody.

88
00:05:01,177 --> 00:05:02,887
Best man. The better man.

89
00:05:07,767 --> 00:05:10,311
We've all done crazy things
in our life, so...

90
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:13,939
He's playing the guitar now.
Isn't that great?

91
00:05:15,691 --> 00:05:16,817
He's doing good.

92
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,027
Sounds good?

93
00:05:18,069 --> 00:05:20,237
It's because I'm the best
guitar player in the world.

94
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:21,781
Self-taught.

95
00:05:21,822 --> 00:05:24,617
No lessons,
thank you very much, Pop.

96
00:05:24,658 --> 00:05:25,826
All right.

97
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,329
They'll be divorced in a year.

98
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:29,830
Very good.

99
00:05:29,872 --> 00:05:33,876
I think we all know
that when you fall in love...

100
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,961
the emptiness
kind of drifts away.

101
00:05:36,003 --> 00:05:37,713
That's all I'm talking about.

102
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:40,800
I've done some crazy things
in my life, too...

103
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,677
but then I met
a very special girl...

104
00:05:43,719 --> 00:05:45,554
a girl who I'm actually
marrying next week.

105
00:05:46,931 --> 00:05:48,432
Thank you.

106
00:05:48,474 --> 00:05:52,311
So all I'm saying is that
when you fall in love...

107
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:54,313
the emptiness drifts away...

108
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,023
because you find something
to live for...

109
00:05:56,023 --> 00:05:57,066
each other.

110
00:05:57,066 --> 00:05:59,068
And the way
I've seen you two...

111
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:00,820
looking into each other's
eyes all day long...

112
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,738
I can tell that you're
gonna live for each other...

113
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,989
for the rest of your lives.

114
00:06:06,075 --> 00:06:07,576
So cheers.

115
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,958
That's a good
wedding singer.

116
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:21,799
Now on behalf of
Mr. and Mrs. Harold Veltri...

117
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:23,968
you guys have a nice dinner.

118
00:06:24,009 --> 00:06:26,262
George Stitzer's gonna take over
on lead vocals...

119
00:06:26,262 --> 00:06:27,680
so take it away, George.

120
00:06:35,604 --> 00:06:39,942
Give me time...

121
00:06:41,944 --> 00:06:46,407
To realize my crime.

122
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:54,498
Let me love and stay.

123
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:57,084
-Jesus.
-Scary.

124
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:05,009
I have danced...

125
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:08,596
I like her.

126
00:07:08,637 --> 00:07:12,224
Inside your eyes.

127
00:07:13,768 --> 00:07:17,229
How can love...

128
00:07:17,271 --> 00:07:21,275
Be real?

129
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:26,197
Do you really want to hurt me?

130
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:29,283
Good save, wedding singer.

131
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:30,743
Good job.

132
00:07:30,826 --> 00:07:33,829
Sammy, how come you're not out
with your limo? What's up?

133
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:35,539
That new waitress.
That's what's up.

134
00:07:35,581 --> 00:07:38,000
Is she in trouble.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,835
She's gonna get it,
and she doesn't even know it...

136
00:07:39,877 --> 00:07:41,128
and I'm gonna give it to her.

137
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,756
Take it easy, man. Who is she?

138
00:07:43,798 --> 00:07:45,257
She's Holly Sullivan's cousin.

139
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,884
If she's
half as easy as Holly...

140
00:07:46,926 --> 00:07:48,677
I'll close this deal
by the end of the week.

141
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,723
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

142
00:07:52,765 --> 00:07:55,101
Please. It's her first day.

143
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,644
Always takes them three weeks...

144
00:07:56,685 --> 00:07:58,521
to realize they shouldn't
date anyone at work.

145
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,899
You like being the guy
that helps them realize that?

146
00:08:01,941 --> 00:08:03,484
Yes, I do.

147
00:08:03,526 --> 00:08:05,611
You want to be like Fonzie,
don't you?

148
00:08:07,196 --> 00:08:08,656
You're on your way.

149
00:08:09,949 --> 00:08:14,995
Do you really want to hurt me?

150
00:08:15,037 --> 00:08:18,582
Do you really want
to make me cry?

151
00:08:28,342 --> 00:08:29,719
Prime rib, please.

152
00:08:29,719 --> 00:08:33,055
Always the prime rib.
Make them eat the fish.

153
00:08:33,055 --> 00:08:35,057
Andre,
can I have three prime rib?

154
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,518
Your wish is my command, madame.

155
00:08:38,769 --> 00:08:41,814
How come he's so nice to you?

156
00:08:41,856 --> 00:08:44,650
I let him look at my boobs
at the Christmas party.

157
00:08:44,692 --> 00:08:47,069
Not my finest half-hour...

158
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:50,156
but it's been a pleasant
working environment ever since.

159
00:08:54,869 --> 00:08:57,329
So, how's your first night
going?

160
00:08:58,497 --> 00:09:00,624
Being at this wedding
is making me realize...

161
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,626
that Glenn is never
going to set a date...

162
00:09:02,668 --> 00:09:04,879
and I've been wearing
this ring for two years...

163
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,422
and I feel like an idiot.

164
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:08,215
You know what you must do?

165
00:09:09,383 --> 00:09:12,386
Relax. Don't do it.

166
00:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,477
I feel stupid for moving here
to be closer to him.

167
00:09:19,518 --> 00:09:22,438
I think you need a break.
Go out back and get some air.

168
00:09:22,438 --> 00:09:23,439
I'll cover your tables.

169
00:09:24,774 --> 00:09:25,900
You OK?

170
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:28,444
You going to throw up?

171
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,030
Come with me, man.

172
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:44,585
Give me time...

173
00:09:44,627 --> 00:09:46,045
What?

174
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:49,799
Here we go.

175
00:09:49,799 --> 00:09:51,592
Come on.

176
00:09:51,634 --> 00:09:53,969
You got it. There.

177
00:09:55,137 --> 00:09:56,389
Is he a friend of yours?

178
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,598
Me? No.

179
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,935
I couldn't let him do it
in front of his family.

180
00:10:00,976 --> 00:10:02,103
Wow.

181
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:05,147
I'm glad I got to see it.

182
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:09,360
You all through?

183
00:10:09,402 --> 00:10:12,947
Going to wait a few years
before you drink again?

184
00:10:12,988 --> 00:10:14,740
All right, remember,
alcohol equals puke...

185
00:10:14,782 --> 00:10:17,410
equals smelly mess
equals nobody likes you.

186
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:20,246
I got it from here.

187
00:10:20,287 --> 00:10:22,665
Know what? You go this way,
and you go this way.

188
00:10:22,665 --> 00:10:25,459
It's for the best.
It's all right. Take it easy.

189
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,712
See you later.
Sleep it off, pal.

190
00:10:27,753 --> 00:10:29,213
Hey, you know,
wedding singer?

191
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:39,056
Are you drinking, too?

192
00:10:39,098 --> 00:10:41,851
No. It's Coca-cola.

193
00:10:41,892 --> 00:10:44,770
Are you sure? There's
no rum in that Coca-cola?

194
00:10:44,812 --> 00:10:46,814
I'm not a big drinker...

195
00:10:46,856 --> 00:10:49,984
and if it was, I'd be puking
more than that kid.

196
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,361
I don't think anybody could
puke more than that kid.

197
00:10:52,445 --> 00:10:53,863
I think I saw a boot come out.

198
00:10:56,157 --> 00:10:57,658
You're the wedding singer.

199
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,035
How you doing? I'm Robbie.

200
00:11:00,035 --> 00:11:01,579
I'm Julia.

201
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,914
I'm actually waitressing
at your wedding next week.

202
00:11:03,956 --> 00:11:06,751
Cool. That's a beautiful ring
you have there.

203
00:11:06,792 --> 00:11:08,002
Are you getting married, too?

204
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,090
Actually, I don't know
how serious the guy is...

205
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:15,176
who gave this to me.

206
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:19,889
I feel like I'm doomed to wander
the planet alone forever.

207
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,434
Like the Incredible Hulk?

208
00:11:23,476 --> 00:11:27,730
Yeah...only
I'm not helping people.

209
00:11:27,772 --> 00:11:30,608
That's not true,
because I saw you inside.

210
00:11:30,649 --> 00:11:32,193
You were helping people.

211
00:11:32,234 --> 00:11:35,279
You were giving them
fish and coffee and forks.

212
00:11:35,321 --> 00:11:36,864
People can't eat without forks.

213
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:39,116
And they can't
drink without a fish.

214
00:11:39,158 --> 00:11:41,869
That's right.
What does that mean?

215
00:11:41,911 --> 00:11:44,705
I don't know.
You lost me back at the Hulk.

216
00:11:45,873 --> 00:11:47,333
Robbie, you better
get back in there.

217
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,043
They're starting
to turn on George.

218
00:11:49,085 --> 00:11:51,128
-Sit down!
-You suck!

219
00:11:53,547 --> 00:11:56,050
He's got to learn a new song.

220
00:11:56,092 --> 00:11:58,219
But it was nice to meet you.

221
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:59,595
It was nice meeting you, too.

222
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:02,765
And if I ever get married,
maybe you'll sing at my wedding.

223
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:04,517
Oh, man. It's a deal.

224
00:12:04,558 --> 00:12:05,935
Take care.

225
00:12:09,105 --> 00:12:12,483
There was love...

226
00:12:12,525 --> 00:12:15,069
All around...

227
00:12:15,111 --> 00:12:16,862
But I never...

228
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:19,407
Heard it singing.

229
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:20,783
Very nice.

230
00:12:20,783 --> 00:12:22,868
No, I never...

231
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,954
Heard it at all...

232
00:12:24,995 --> 00:12:25,955
Pretty.

233
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:29,959
'Til there was you.

234
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,252
Much better.

235
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:32,837
You're going
to blow everybody away...

236
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:34,422
at your fiftieth
anniversary party.

237
00:12:34,463 --> 00:12:38,676
If I sing to Frank
without making any mistakes...

238
00:12:38,718 --> 00:12:40,678
he would know
how hard I've worked...

239
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,265
and how much I still love him
after all these years.

240
00:12:44,306 --> 00:12:46,100
I hope 50 years from now...

241
00:12:46,142 --> 00:12:48,144
Linda and I are as happy
as you two guys.

242
00:12:48,185 --> 00:12:51,397
You will be.
It runs in your family.

243
00:12:51,439 --> 00:12:54,984
You're a born romantic,
just like your father was.

244
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,195
I know they'll be
looking down on you tomorrow.

245
00:12:58,237 --> 00:12:59,697
I hope so.

246
00:12:59,697 --> 00:13:01,073
Are you nervous?

247
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:02,825
I'm actually not
that nervous, you know?

248
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:05,161
I'm at weddings all the time.
It's going to be fun.

249
00:13:05,161 --> 00:13:08,956
Not about the wedding--
about the wedding night.

250
00:13:08,998 --> 00:13:11,834
Will this be your first time
with intercourse?

251
00:13:13,627 --> 00:13:15,171
Don't be ashamed.

252
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:18,799
When I got married,
I wasn't a virgin.

253
00:13:18,841 --> 00:13:22,094
I already had intercourse
with eight men.

254
00:13:22,094 --> 00:13:25,806
That's actually something
I don't want to know about.

255
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:29,852
That was a lot back then.
That would be like 200 today.

256
00:13:31,187 --> 00:13:33,105
It's 5:00.
I'm going to get going.

257
00:13:33,147 --> 00:13:34,815
But your payment.

258
00:13:34,857 --> 00:13:37,610
My payment.
Can I get it to go?

259
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,904
You're such a sweet boy...

260
00:13:39,945 --> 00:13:42,948
letting an old woman
pay you with meatballs.

261
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:46,368
They taste so good,
it's like I'm ripping you off.

262
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:49,705
I don't have
any clean Tupperware.

263
00:13:49,705 --> 00:13:52,041
All right,
definitely next time.

264
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:54,460
Don't be silly.
Now hold out your hands.

265
00:13:54,502 --> 00:13:56,754
-You want to--
-Do it.

266
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:02,009
Cool.

267
00:14:02,051 --> 00:14:03,344
Thanks a lot.

268
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:09,433
Now, please, take a bite...

269
00:14:09,475 --> 00:14:11,519
so that I can
watch you enjoy.

270
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,437
That's my favorite part.

271
00:14:13,479 --> 00:14:16,482
Well...
I'll go with the right one.

272
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:17,525
That looks good.

273
00:14:23,197 --> 00:14:25,408
That's a good meatball.

274
00:14:25,449 --> 00:14:30,246
Now, listen to me, Robbie Hart.

275
00:14:30,329 --> 00:14:33,499
You're going to be
a fine husband.

276
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,127
I hope so, Rosie. Thank you.

277
00:14:36,168 --> 00:14:37,586
I'm going to leave.

278
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:38,921
I'll see you
at the wedding, all right?

279
00:14:49,265 --> 00:14:51,809
Thank you for coming in
and taking me to lunch.

280
00:14:51,851 --> 00:14:54,478
Look at the picture
of that girl. See that?

281
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,356
You're a lot prettier
than that girl...

282
00:14:57,398 --> 00:14:58,774
and she's getting married.

283
00:14:58,774 --> 00:15:01,610
What does pretty have to do
with getting married?

284
00:15:01,652 --> 00:15:03,654
Everything.
You got to get married...

285
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:06,490
before your hips start spreading
and you get facial hair...

286
00:15:06,532 --> 00:15:09,577
which, by the way,
comes from your father's mother.

287
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:12,621
Looks like Magnum, P.I.,
for God's sake.

288
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:15,708
I can't make Glenn set a date.

289
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,003
You're going to hate
this idea...

290
00:15:19,045 --> 00:15:24,467
but I think you should consider
a fake pregnancy.

291
00:15:24,508 --> 00:15:25,760
I'm exiting the car.

292
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:27,386
It's just a means to an end.

293
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:29,722
ln five years,
he'll thank you for it.

294
00:15:48,491 --> 00:15:49,825
Perhaps we should call her.

295
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:54,455
She's probably got
a make-up problem or her dress.

296
00:15:54,497 --> 00:15:57,208
I know her.
She likes to look her best.

297
00:16:11,931 --> 00:16:13,432
Hey, sis.

298
00:16:13,474 --> 00:16:14,683
Hi, Robs.

299
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:17,812
I just got off the phone
with Linda's mom.

300
00:16:17,853 --> 00:16:20,523
Linda's not there, but...

301
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:21,690
there was a note.

302
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:23,234
A note?

303
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,986
Everything all right?

304
00:16:26,028 --> 00:16:28,489
Yeah, she's OK.

305
00:16:28,531 --> 00:16:30,950
It basically indicated...

306
00:16:30,991 --> 00:16:34,078
that Linda was...

307
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:36,038
not coming today.

308
00:16:40,084 --> 00:16:42,586
So, it was a bad note.

309
00:16:43,921 --> 00:16:46,006
Did she say why?

310
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:51,512
I am so sorry, honey.

311
00:16:52,555 --> 00:16:53,639
It's OK.

312
00:16:54,890 --> 00:16:56,392
You want me to say something?

313
00:16:59,353 --> 00:17:02,273
Just give me a second.
I'll be right back.

314
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,402
Oh, my God,
she's not showing up.

315
00:17:18,456 --> 00:17:21,542
Don't worry.
Everything's gonna be all right.

316
00:17:21,584 --> 00:17:23,210
It's OK.

317
00:17:29,383 --> 00:17:30,885
Oh, God!

318
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,230
You can't catch me!

319
00:17:43,272 --> 00:17:46,067
I'm going to get you
and chop you up!

320
00:17:46,108 --> 00:17:48,736
Can we turn this crap off,
please?

321
00:17:48,778 --> 00:17:51,739
That's right, Robbie.
You have to let it out.

322
00:17:51,781 --> 00:17:53,991
-Let what out?
-Your feelings.

323
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:56,744
About what that lousy bitch
did to you today.

324
00:17:56,786 --> 00:17:57,828
Don't call her that...

325
00:17:57,870 --> 00:17:59,205
because we're going
to get back together...

326
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,207
and then there will be weirdness
between you and me...

327
00:18:01,248 --> 00:18:03,334
so just watch it.

328
00:18:03,376 --> 00:18:05,503
I made this for you,
Uncle Robbie.

329
00:18:05,544 --> 00:18:07,797
Thanks, Freddy Krueger.

330
00:18:07,838 --> 00:18:10,132
That's not nice.

331
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:12,301
Very creative, though.

332
00:18:12,343 --> 00:18:13,886
Go back to the boiler room.

333
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:17,973
I just wish I knew
where she was, you know?

334
00:18:21,769 --> 00:18:23,312
He's taking it pretty bad.

335
00:18:23,354 --> 00:18:25,481
He's acting like a real robot...

336
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:27,316
a zombie or something.

337
00:18:27,316 --> 00:18:30,236
He's been wanting to get married
since the third grade.

338
00:18:30,277 --> 00:18:32,947
It makes sense.
That's when Mom and Dad died.

339
00:18:32,988 --> 00:18:35,491
He wants to start
a family of his own.

340
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,034
Check out the cake.

341
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:39,829
There's only
a little groom on top.

342
00:18:59,807 --> 00:19:01,016
You're late.

343
00:19:01,058 --> 00:19:03,352
I'm sorry.

344
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:04,979
I just couldn't do it.

345
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:10,192
If you need some more time,
I guess I can wait.

346
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:14,739
No, I don't need
more time, Robbie.

347
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:16,157
I don't ever want to marry you.

348
00:19:20,703 --> 00:19:22,079
You know, that information...

349
00:19:22,121 --> 00:19:25,458
might have been a little
more useful to me yesterday.

350
00:19:27,376 --> 00:19:29,378
I've been talking to my friends
the last couple of days...

351
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:31,213
Here it comes.

352
00:19:31,255 --> 00:19:34,842
And I think I figured out
what's been bothering me.

353
00:19:34,884 --> 00:19:37,011
I'm not in love with Robbie now.

354
00:19:37,053 --> 00:19:40,639
I'm in love with Robbie
six years ago...

355
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:42,850
Robbie, the lead singer
of Final Warning...

356
00:19:42,933 --> 00:19:44,852
when I used to come and
watch you from the front row...

357
00:19:44,894 --> 00:19:47,021
in your spandex pants...

358
00:19:47,063 --> 00:19:49,190
your silk shirt unbuttoned...

359
00:19:50,566 --> 00:19:53,277
licking the microphone
like David Lee Roth.

360
00:19:53,319 --> 00:19:55,738
I still got the spandex.
I'll put them on right now.

361
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:57,656
The point is,
I woke up this morning...

362
00:19:57,698 --> 00:20:01,035
and I realized I'm about
to marry a wedding singer.

363
00:20:01,077 --> 00:20:03,537
I am never going
to leave Ridgefield.

364
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:05,498
Why do you need
to leave Ridgefield?

365
00:20:05,539 --> 00:20:08,584
We grew up here.
All our friends are here.

366
00:20:08,626 --> 00:20:10,753
It's the perfect place
to raise a family.

367
00:20:10,795 --> 00:20:13,297
Living in your sister's
basement with five kids...

368
00:20:13,339 --> 00:20:15,132
while you're off every
weekend doing wedding gigs...

369
00:20:15,174 --> 00:20:17,093
at a whopping 60 bucks a pop?

370
00:20:17,134 --> 00:20:18,636
Once again...

371
00:20:18,677 --> 00:20:20,596
things that could have been
brought to my attention...

372
00:20:20,596 --> 00:20:21,722
yesterday!

373
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,852
The fact is,
we grew apart a long time ago.

374
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,439
You wanted to get married.
You didn't care to who.

375
00:20:30,481 --> 00:20:33,692
That's not true. I love you.
Come here.

376
00:20:33,734 --> 00:20:37,238
I want to spend
the rest of my life with you.

377
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:39,698
Hey, Linda.

378
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,742
You're a bitch.

379
00:20:44,912 --> 00:20:47,456
Thanks, Petey.
Go back to the house.

380
00:20:50,376 --> 00:20:52,670
He might have
Tourette's syndrome.

381
00:20:52,712 --> 00:20:54,088
We're looking into it.

382
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:57,883
I got to go.

383
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,096
I'm sorry.

384
00:21:17,361 --> 00:21:19,905
Ninety-nine Luftballons...

385
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,118
Glenn!

386
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,370
Don't be so jumpy.

387
00:21:26,412 --> 00:21:28,622
These are for you.

388
00:21:28,664 --> 00:21:30,124
Thank you.

389
00:21:32,043 --> 00:21:34,128
They're beautiful.

390
00:21:35,588 --> 00:21:37,757
I have something else for you.

391
00:21:42,094 --> 00:21:45,097
Two airplane tickets
to Las Vegas?

392
00:21:48,934 --> 00:21:50,978
Oh, my God, Glenn!

393
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:53,814
I know you wanted
to set a date...

394
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:55,983
so I went to the travel agent
and set it.

395
00:21:57,359 --> 00:21:59,612
Glenn, I love you so much...

396
00:21:59,653 --> 00:22:00,780
but Las Vegas? I thought--

397
00:22:00,821 --> 00:22:02,865
Jules, it's the romance
capital of the world.

398
00:22:02,907 --> 00:22:05,493
I just don't want
a big wedding--

399
00:22:05,534 --> 00:22:07,203
hundreds of people
we don't know...

400
00:22:07,244 --> 00:22:09,246
that are just there
for the free drinks...

401
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:11,332
and all-you-can-eat buffet.

402
00:22:11,374 --> 00:22:13,376
They might as well be in Vegas.

403
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:22,968
Las Vegas it is,
and it'll be great.

404
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,555
Are you going to do
the girl thing?

405
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:29,934
You're going to act happy
and be pouting on the inside?

406
00:22:31,394 --> 00:22:33,062
I'm happy.

407
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,235
All right.

408
00:22:39,235 --> 00:22:40,903
Let's get married here.

409
00:22:40,945 --> 00:22:43,823
I know that's what you want.

410
00:22:43,864 --> 00:22:45,741
Thank you, Glenn.

411
00:22:47,076 --> 00:22:48,577
It's more important
to you anyway.

412
00:22:50,079 --> 00:22:52,707
I promise I will give you
the most beautiful wedding...

413
00:22:52,748 --> 00:22:54,750
and even you'll have
a good time.

414
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,569
It's about time
his best friend showed up.

415
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:23,362
So, how's he doing?

416
00:23:23,404 --> 00:23:24,822
I don't know.

417
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:27,950
He's been down in the basement
since it happened.

418
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,952
Five days now.

419
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:34,165
I think he's having some kind
of a mental situation...

420
00:23:34,206 --> 00:23:36,709
an episode or something.

421
00:23:36,751 --> 00:23:38,169
All right.

422
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,590
You do something, because
I don't want to be known...

423
00:23:42,631 --> 00:23:44,884
as the brother-in-law
of the town nut job.

424
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:46,343
I got enough problems already.

425
00:23:46,385 --> 00:23:48,554
Shit,
I got water all over myself.

426
00:23:57,354 --> 00:23:58,856
Hello?

427
00:24:04,236 --> 00:24:05,905
You all right?

428
00:24:13,579 --> 00:24:16,457
These sheets are soft.
You use Downy?

429
00:24:18,501 --> 00:24:20,836
All Tempa-Cheer.

430
00:24:20,836 --> 00:24:22,838
You can wash your clothes
at any temperature...

431
00:24:22,838 --> 00:24:24,840
and the colors
don't run together.

432
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:28,094
-Really?
-Yeah. Now leave me alone.

433
00:24:29,678 --> 00:24:31,764
You have to go back to work.

434
00:24:31,806 --> 00:24:35,017
There's going to be over
a hundred drunk girls...

435
00:24:35,059 --> 00:24:36,185
at this wedding tonight.

436
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:37,770
I've got nothing
to offer anybody.

437
00:24:37,812 --> 00:24:41,107
I haven't done jack shit
since high school.

438
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:43,150
Why would any girl
ever marry me?

439
00:24:43,192 --> 00:24:44,902
Marry you?

440
00:24:44,944 --> 00:24:46,946
I'm just trying to get someone
to play with your ding-dong.

441
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,369
Holiday...

442
00:24:55,538 --> 00:24:57,790
Celebrate...

443
00:25:08,718 --> 00:25:11,721
If we took a holiday...

444
00:25:13,097 --> 00:25:15,433
Took some time to celebrate...

445
00:25:15,474 --> 00:25:17,393
Come on, let's celebrate.

446
00:25:17,435 --> 00:25:19,979
Just one day out of life...

447
00:25:21,647 --> 00:25:23,858
It would be...

448
00:25:23,899 --> 00:25:27,236
It would be so nice.

449
00:25:27,236 --> 00:25:30,823
Everybody spread the word.

450
00:25:30,865 --> 00:25:35,161
I live in
my sister's basement.

451
00:25:36,328 --> 00:25:38,497
He just had his heart broken.

452
00:25:38,539 --> 00:25:41,292
Why would he even think
about coming back to work?

453
00:25:41,375 --> 00:25:43,002
I don't know.

454
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:45,671
Celebrate.

455
00:25:56,849 --> 00:25:59,393
You guys are off
to a great start.

456
00:25:59,435 --> 00:26:00,936
I mean...

457
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:03,647
Cindy showed up,
so, right away, Scott...

458
00:26:03,689 --> 00:26:05,107
you got to be pretty psyched.

459
00:26:06,525 --> 00:26:09,070
I'm not paying you to hear
your thoughts on life.

460
00:26:09,111 --> 00:26:10,446
I'm paying you to sing.

461
00:26:12,114 --> 00:26:15,618
I have a microphone,
and you don't...

462
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,579
so you will listen
to every damn word...

463
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:20,373
I have to say!

464
00:26:27,296 --> 00:26:31,759
It's funny. Some of us
will never find true love.

465
00:26:31,801 --> 00:26:35,554
Like, take, for instance...me.

466
00:26:36,764 --> 00:26:38,724
And I'm pretty sure
that guy right there.

467
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:43,145
And that lady
with the sideburns.

468
00:26:45,022 --> 00:26:47,608
And basically
everybody at table nine.

469
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:51,320
But the worst thing is...

470
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:57,326
that me, fatty,
sideburns lady...

471
00:26:57,368 --> 00:26:59,161
and the mutants
over at table nine...

472
00:27:01,205 --> 00:27:04,500
will never, ever find a way
to better the situation...

473
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:06,627
because...

474
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:10,339
apparently, we have
absolutely nothing to offer...

475
00:27:10,381 --> 00:27:11,924
the opposite sex.

476
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:16,011
You are the worst wedding singer
in the world, buddy!

477
00:27:16,011 --> 00:27:18,139
Sir, one more outburst...

478
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:20,558
I will strangle you
with my microphone wire.

479
00:27:23,436 --> 00:27:25,229
Let's cut the stupid cake...

480
00:27:25,271 --> 00:27:27,189
because the fat guy's
going to have a heart attack...

481
00:27:27,189 --> 00:27:28,607
if we don't eat again soon.

482
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:34,739
And while we do that,
here's a little mood music.

483
00:27:42,204 --> 00:27:44,832
Cindy and Scott are newlyweds.

484
00:27:50,588 --> 00:27:53,007
He loves her...

485
00:27:53,049 --> 00:27:55,676
But she loves
this guy right here...

486
00:27:55,718 --> 00:27:58,345
And he loves somebody else.

487
00:27:58,387 --> 00:28:01,307
You just can't win.

488
00:28:01,348 --> 00:28:03,309
And so it goes...

489
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:06,270
Until the day you die.

490
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:08,773
This thing they call love...

491
00:28:08,814 --> 00:28:11,067
Is gonna make you cry.

492
00:28:11,108 --> 00:28:12,276
I hate you.

493
00:28:12,318 --> 00:28:14,361
I've had the blues...

494
00:28:14,403 --> 00:28:17,198
The reds and the pinks.

495
00:28:17,239 --> 00:28:19,867
One thing's for sure...

496
00:28:20,910 --> 00:28:21,911
Love stinks?

497
00:28:21,911 --> 00:28:23,537
Love stinks.

498
00:28:45,476 --> 00:28:47,895
Drug addict! Degenerate!

499
00:29:16,257 --> 00:29:19,218
I was wondering
what happened to you.

500
00:29:21,178 --> 00:29:23,097
Did everybody leave?

501
00:29:24,306 --> 00:29:26,642
Pretty much,
except for a few cops...

502
00:29:26,684 --> 00:29:29,270
that are still interviewing
some witnesses.

503
00:29:34,066 --> 00:29:36,235
I'm going to get
the hell out of here.

504
00:29:38,404 --> 00:29:39,989
So it was
your first wedding back.

505
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,366
Of course things are going
to be a little shaky.

506
00:29:42,408 --> 00:29:44,952
A little shaky?
I hate weddings.

507
00:29:44,994 --> 00:29:48,205
I hate the bride.
I hate the groom.

508
00:29:48,247 --> 00:29:51,292
I want them to be miserable,
because that's what I am.

509
00:29:51,333 --> 00:29:53,335
No. You're the best.

510
00:29:53,335 --> 00:29:56,922
At what? People eat
prime rib, and I sing.

511
00:29:56,964 --> 00:30:00,468
It's a joke.
I can't do this anymore.

512
00:30:01,469 --> 00:30:04,346
Glenn and I set the date...

513
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:06,348
so you have to play our wedding.

514
00:30:08,476 --> 00:30:09,977
Congratulations.

515
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:15,316
I just can't do it, all right?

516
00:30:16,358 --> 00:30:18,819
I'm having an engagement party
in two weeks...

517
00:30:18,861 --> 00:30:21,072
and I really want
you and Sammy to come.

518
00:30:42,593 --> 00:30:44,595
Good, you're here.

519
00:30:44,637 --> 00:30:47,098
Robbie's here!
Let's move it!

520
00:30:47,139 --> 00:30:49,016
The kids have been fed,
but if they want snacks...

521
00:30:49,058 --> 00:30:52,395
there's ice pops in the freezer,
or microwave popcorn.

522
00:30:52,395 --> 00:30:53,729
Good.

523
00:30:53,771 --> 00:30:55,356
Are you going
to the engagement party?

524
00:30:55,398 --> 00:30:57,191
Yeah, I'll probably go.

525
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,903
Come on, Andy, move your ass!

526
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:02,863
Hang on. I'm watching Dallas.

527
00:31:02,905 --> 00:31:05,366
I think J.R. might be dead.
They shot him.

528
00:31:05,408 --> 00:31:06,367
Good night.

529
00:31:06,409 --> 00:31:08,411
-Love you.
-Love you.

530
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:10,538
Time to make the donuts.

531
00:31:10,579 --> 00:31:11,706
I made the donuts.

532
00:31:11,747 --> 00:31:14,583
Dunkin' donuts--
up to 52 varieties...

533
00:31:14,625 --> 00:31:16,419
Uncle Robbie's here.

534
00:31:18,254 --> 00:31:21,048
Hey, the Goofball Brothers.

535
00:31:21,090 --> 00:31:23,718
ls it true you're in the middle
of a nervous breakdown?

536
00:31:26,721 --> 00:31:29,890
-Who said that?
-Everybody.

537
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:32,268
You're eight years old.
You only know your parents.

538
00:31:32,268 --> 00:31:33,561
What are you talking about?

539
00:31:33,602 --> 00:31:36,355
Is it true you're gonna end up
in a mental institution?

540
00:31:36,397 --> 00:31:38,524
Cuckoo's nest!

541
00:31:39,692 --> 00:31:40,985
Hey, kids.

542
00:31:43,195 --> 00:31:45,030
Remember what we talked about?

543
00:31:47,366 --> 00:31:49,201
Go over there
and watch some television.

544
00:31:49,243 --> 00:31:51,120
Can I speak to you for a second?

545
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,747
Everybody...

546
00:31:55,624 --> 00:31:57,626
I've been thinking
about what happened to you...

547
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:59,128
and it's all for the best.

548
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,756
I know you were
in love and everything...

549
00:32:01,797 --> 00:32:02,882
but that wears off.

550
00:32:02,923 --> 00:32:06,343
Me and your sister,
we used to be wild.

551
00:32:06,385 --> 00:32:08,429
She was very adventurous...

552
00:32:08,471 --> 00:32:11,390
and we got into some crazy shit.

553
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:13,100
But now the thrill is gone.

554
00:32:13,142 --> 00:32:16,395
If we get a second alone,
we usually go to sleep.

555
00:32:16,479 --> 00:32:19,065
If it's a special occasion...

556
00:32:19,106 --> 00:32:21,942
she might do
this exotic dance for me.

557
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:23,444
What?

558
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:26,906
Sometimes she might
work with my nipples a bit.

559
00:32:26,947 --> 00:32:28,699
All right, enough. Go out.

560
00:32:28,741 --> 00:32:30,576
I'll take care of the kids.

561
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:34,830
I don't know what I just said,
but I said something.

562
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,965
Women got a thing
about marriage.

563
00:32:44,965 --> 00:32:49,220
If you want to stay with them,
you're gonna have to marry them.

564
00:32:49,261 --> 00:32:51,514
No big deal. There she is.

565
00:32:51,555 --> 00:32:53,933
The girl who finally beat me
into submission.

566
00:32:53,974 --> 00:32:55,101
That's right.

567
00:32:55,101 --> 00:32:57,436
August 5th
is less than three months away.

568
00:32:57,478 --> 00:32:59,605
We've got a lot of planning
to do.

569
00:32:59,647 --> 00:33:01,649
Do you think
it would be better...

570
00:33:01,690 --> 00:33:04,527
if maybe you took over
all the arrangements?

571
00:33:04,527 --> 00:33:07,988
I'd like to do it together.

572
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:11,242
Yeah, but you like this stuff.

573
00:33:11,283 --> 00:33:12,785
It's really not my thing.

574
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:16,872
God forbid I screw up
the wedding flowers.

575
00:33:16,914 --> 00:33:18,290
How could I live with myself?

576
00:33:18,332 --> 00:33:19,500
He'll be so wasted...

577
00:33:19,583 --> 00:33:22,712
he won't know flowers
are at the wedding.

578
00:33:25,381 --> 00:33:27,633
I hear you're gonna have
your bachelor party Friday.

579
00:33:27,717 --> 00:33:31,846
Gonna be all right with that?
You might miss Miami Vice.

580
00:33:31,887 --> 00:33:35,349
Nope. Summer. Reruns.
I'm all set.

581
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:37,810
Great.

582
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:42,982
All right, nice house.

583
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:45,985
I told you this guy was loaded.

584
00:33:46,068 --> 00:33:49,405
I know. In and out, though.
I don't want to be here long.

585
00:33:49,405 --> 00:33:52,074
Let me just pick up a chick,
and we'll get out of here.

586
00:33:52,158 --> 00:33:53,868
What do you think
of the jacket?

587
00:33:53,909 --> 00:33:57,538
I would lose that glove.
You look nuts.

588
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:59,707
There's Julia.

589
00:34:01,375 --> 00:34:03,461
Let's go say hello.

590
00:34:04,754 --> 00:34:06,881
Hi, you guys.

591
00:34:06,922 --> 00:34:08,632
I'm so glad you came.

592
00:34:08,674 --> 00:34:10,926
Jason,
this is Robbie and Sammy...

593
00:34:10,968 --> 00:34:13,429
and this is my fiance Glenn.

594
00:34:13,471 --> 00:34:15,723
-Congratulations, Glenn.
-Thank you.

595
00:34:15,765 --> 00:34:16,891
Robbie Hart.

596
00:34:16,932 --> 00:34:20,686
I heard what happened
to you at your wedding.

597
00:34:20,728 --> 00:34:23,689
That was so cold.
You must have felt like shit.

598
00:34:23,773 --> 00:34:28,027
No. It felt really good.
Thanks for bringing it up.

599
00:34:28,069 --> 00:34:30,946
My parents died when I was 10.
Want to talk about that?

600
00:34:30,946 --> 00:34:33,115
Why would we want
to talk about that?

601
00:34:33,157 --> 00:34:34,617
I don't know.

602
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:36,243
Somebody needs a drink.

603
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:38,454
Actually,
I'm not a big drinker.

604
00:34:38,496 --> 00:34:40,289
I am.
How about an Alabama Slammer?

605
00:34:40,331 --> 00:34:41,457
Sounds like a plan.

606
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:43,459
Meet me at the bar.
I gotta piss first.

607
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:45,753
Have a few drinks
and drive home.

608
00:34:47,963 --> 00:34:50,257
Julia, thanks for inviting us.

609
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:53,135
I'm glad you guys came.
We hang out at work so much...

610
00:34:53,135 --> 00:34:55,388
but we don't get to talk
'cause we're always so busy.

611
00:34:57,098 --> 00:34:59,266
We should make time to talk,
don't you think?

612
00:35:01,769 --> 00:35:05,022
Know what? The first time
this guy saw you...

613
00:35:05,064 --> 00:35:07,316
he told me
he was gonna hit on you.

614
00:35:07,358 --> 00:35:09,944
-Really?
-That's not true.

615
00:35:09,985 --> 00:35:12,780
Yeah, it is.
You told me she was in trouble.

616
00:35:12,822 --> 00:35:15,658
She was gonna get it,
and she didn't even know it.

617
00:35:15,658 --> 00:35:17,618
He's teasing.
I would never say that.

618
00:35:17,702 --> 00:35:20,287
You said you were
gonna give it to her.

619
00:35:20,329 --> 00:35:22,289
Give me what, exactly?

620
00:35:22,331 --> 00:35:23,874
You're a jerk.

621
00:35:23,916 --> 00:35:26,335
What do you mean?
You didn't know she was engaged.

622
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:28,254
So now you're not
gonna give it to me?

623
00:35:28,295 --> 00:35:29,964
Very funny.

624
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:31,465
Say hi to your brother Tito.

625
00:35:36,345 --> 00:35:38,305
So how are you doing?

626
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:41,392
I'm doing better. I don't know.

627
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:43,853
How are you and Glenn doing
with the wedding plans?

628
00:35:46,647 --> 00:35:50,025
Glenn isn't really--
He's very busy right now.

629
00:35:50,067 --> 00:35:54,155
He works on Wall Street.
You know how that is nowadays.

630
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:57,199
Wall Street--stocks and stuff?

631
00:35:57,199 --> 00:35:58,325
Actually, he's in bonds.

632
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:01,787
He barely has time to sleep,
let alone plan a wedding...

633
00:36:01,829 --> 00:36:03,456
so I'm kind of doing this
on my own.

634
00:36:03,539 --> 00:36:06,584
But I went to Marshall's
for the floral centerpieces.

635
00:36:06,625 --> 00:36:09,086
Marshall's?
You should go to Tony's.

636
00:36:09,128 --> 00:36:11,797
They're cheaper, and
they've got a great selection.

637
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:14,842
All right.
Well, thank you for the tip.

638
00:36:14,884 --> 00:36:17,178
It's a shame you won't be
doing weddings anymore.

639
00:36:17,219 --> 00:36:18,554
We won't get
to hang out as much.

640
00:36:18,596 --> 00:36:20,973
We'll get to hang out.

641
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:24,393
There's other things to do
besides weddings, right?

642
00:36:26,228 --> 00:36:28,689
Oy, oy, bar mitzvah...

643
00:36:28,731 --> 00:36:30,858
Mazel tov...

644
00:36:50,586 --> 00:36:51,712
L'chaim !

645
00:36:51,754 --> 00:36:54,924
Let's keep the fun rolling.
Take it away, George.

646
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,232
Do you really want to hurt me?

647
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:15,861
You seem kind of sad.

648
00:37:15,903 --> 00:37:17,571
Why don't you
get out there and dance?

649
00:37:17,613 --> 00:37:20,991
I asked that girl over there.
She turned me down.

650
00:37:21,033 --> 00:37:23,911
She said she didn't dance
with losers.

651
00:37:23,994 --> 00:37:26,706
Man. That hurts.

652
00:37:26,747 --> 00:37:29,625
But why would you want
to dance with somebody...

653
00:37:29,625 --> 00:37:32,294
who doesn't want
to dance with you? Right?

654
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:35,423
Listen, don't worry.

655
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:38,050
You're gonna meet a girl
who treats you right someday.

656
00:37:38,092 --> 00:37:39,427
I promise you.

657
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:43,097
How you guys doing?
All right?

658
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:45,266
I want you to meet
a friend of mine...

659
00:37:45,307 --> 00:37:47,101
by the name of Julia Sullivan.

660
00:37:48,436 --> 00:37:50,896
Could you come out here
for a second?

661
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:53,482
Say hi to Julia, everybody.

662
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:54,525
Hello.

663
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:57,778
Now, who of you out there
would like to dance...

664
00:37:57,820 --> 00:37:59,321
with this fine-looking woman?

665
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:05,578
I'd like to do more
than dance with her.

666
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,622
Wow, Julia.

667
00:38:08,664 --> 00:38:10,708
Sounds to me
like you got your pick...

668
00:38:10,750 --> 00:38:12,752
of any man in this room
to dance with...

669
00:38:12,835 --> 00:38:15,796
so I want you
to take your time...

670
00:38:15,838 --> 00:38:19,633
and find amongst all these
young studs here tonight...

671
00:38:19,675 --> 00:38:22,887
the coolest, most un-losery guy
in the bunch.

672
00:38:24,513 --> 00:38:26,015
Pick me.

673
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:29,518
Please pick me.

674
00:38:40,821 --> 00:38:42,531
May I have this dance?

675
00:38:47,703 --> 00:38:49,747
OK, pal, have fun.

676
00:38:57,088 --> 00:39:00,633
I can only give you love...

677
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:02,843
That lasts forever...

678
00:39:02,885 --> 00:39:06,514
And a promise to be near...

679
00:39:06,555 --> 00:39:09,809
Each time you call...

680
00:39:09,809 --> 00:39:14,063
And the only heart I own...

681
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:17,108
For you and you alone...

682
00:39:17,149 --> 00:39:18,609
That's all.

683
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:26,158
All I have are these arms...

684
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:29,704
To enfold you.
Just go with it.

685
00:39:29,745 --> 00:39:35,084
And a love
time can never destroy.

686
00:39:35,126 --> 00:39:37,002
Take it, George.

687
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:10,870
Come here, Big Red.

688
00:40:15,291 --> 00:40:18,252
If you're wondering
what I'm asking...

689
00:40:18,294 --> 00:40:21,213
In return, dear...

690
00:40:21,255 --> 00:40:22,965
You'll be glad to know...

691
00:40:23,007 --> 00:40:28,345
That my demands are small.

692
00:40:28,387 --> 00:40:32,933
Say it's me
that you'll adore...

693
00:40:32,975 --> 00:40:35,311
For now and ever more.

694
00:40:35,394 --> 00:40:37,313
That's all.

695
00:40:42,985 --> 00:40:45,613
To the new lord of the ladies!

696
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:49,200
You're a lovely dancer.

697
00:40:55,664 --> 00:40:58,167
-Are you gonna tell Glenn?
-About what?

698
00:40:58,167 --> 00:41:01,003
About you and that kid
and him squeezing your tush?

699
00:41:01,045 --> 00:41:04,507
He did have very strong
hands for a 13-year-old.

700
00:41:04,507 --> 00:41:05,674
I could see that.

701
00:41:05,716 --> 00:41:09,220
By the way, thank you for
recommending Tony the florist.

702
00:41:09,261 --> 00:41:11,514
His flowers were beautiful,
and he didn't overcharge me.

703
00:41:11,555 --> 00:41:13,474
Good. I'm glad.

704
00:41:13,516 --> 00:41:14,767
And a new girl in town...

705
00:41:14,809 --> 00:41:16,977
could certainly use that kind
of help on everything.

706
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:19,188
You got Holly
and your mother, right?

707
00:41:19,230 --> 00:41:22,441
My mother lives 50 miles away...

708
00:41:22,483 --> 00:41:24,235
and Holly's
not into that kind of thing...

709
00:41:24,235 --> 00:41:26,445
so that really only leaves
one person.

710
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:36,497
I would, but, you know,
I just--l can't.

711
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:38,207
I understand.

712
00:41:38,249 --> 00:41:40,501
I just don't know
how to go about this.

713
00:41:40,584 --> 00:41:44,213
I'm afraid I'm gonna pay $500
for a half-eaten wedding cake.

714
00:41:44,255 --> 00:41:48,008
I really gotta concentrate
on getting some more gigs.

715
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:50,678
There's only four Jewish
families in this town.

716
00:41:56,434 --> 00:41:58,060
All right.

717
00:42:01,021 --> 00:42:04,650
I have never done it
for that cheap.

718
00:42:04,692 --> 00:42:08,070
I know for a fact you gave
Eric Lamensoft that price.

719
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,322
I did not.

720
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,533
Faye, look at me.

721
00:42:12,575 --> 00:42:15,786
Look me in the eyes.
I'm right here.

722
00:42:15,828 --> 00:42:18,873
Don't look away. Did you
give him that price or not?

723
00:42:22,209 --> 00:42:25,880
OK. Just that one time.
So you got me.

724
00:42:25,921 --> 00:42:28,257
Can I say something?

725
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:31,886
I deal with a lot of people,
but you two look truly happy.

726
00:42:31,927 --> 00:42:34,805
You're gonna make it.
I know. Believe me.

727
00:42:34,847 --> 00:42:35,848
How do you know?

728
00:42:35,890 --> 00:42:38,309
You can just look at a couple...

729
00:42:38,350 --> 00:42:40,186
and you can tell right away...

730
00:42:40,227 --> 00:42:42,813
they're gonna
stay together forever.

731
00:42:42,855 --> 00:42:45,775
Like Donald and Ivana...

732
00:42:45,816 --> 00:42:48,402
and Woody and Mia...

733
00:42:48,444 --> 00:42:51,864
and Burt and Loni.

734
00:42:51,906 --> 00:42:53,449
We're not getting married.

735
00:42:53,491 --> 00:42:56,494
That's right. Actually,
we're brother and sister.

736
00:42:56,535 --> 00:43:00,081
So that's it.
I could sense a closeness.

737
00:43:00,122 --> 00:43:02,208
The weird thing is,
when we were growing up...

738
00:43:02,249 --> 00:43:05,002
we didn't get along 'cause
I used to do this to her.

739
00:43:10,633 --> 00:43:12,927
We're gonna go now.
Come here, sis.

740
00:43:12,968 --> 00:43:15,346
Your ass is grass.

741
00:43:15,388 --> 00:43:17,431
I'm telling Mom
when we get home.

742
00:43:22,144 --> 00:43:23,938
Yes, it's ladies' night...

743
00:43:23,979 --> 00:43:26,065
And the feeling's right.

744
00:43:26,107 --> 00:43:27,817
Yes, it's ladies' night.

745
00:43:27,858 --> 00:43:29,402
Oh, what a...

746
00:43:29,443 --> 00:43:30,403
Oh, what a night.

747
00:43:30,486 --> 00:43:32,113
Yes, it's ladies' night...

748
00:43:32,154 --> 00:43:33,823
And the feeling's right.

749
00:43:33,864 --> 00:43:36,742
I've never seen it from
this perspective before.

750
00:43:36,784 --> 00:43:38,202
Is this what I look like?

751
00:43:38,244 --> 00:43:40,871
No. You're much better
than him.

752
00:43:40,913 --> 00:43:42,623
He's ridiculous.

753
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:43,624
One...

754
00:43:47,545 --> 00:43:49,839
Romantic lady...

755
00:43:51,382 --> 00:43:54,260
Single baby...

756
00:43:55,636 --> 00:43:59,265
Sophisticated mama...

757
00:43:59,306 --> 00:44:03,978
Come on, you disco lady.

758
00:44:04,019 --> 00:44:05,271
Send me a line, mama.

759
00:44:05,312 --> 00:44:06,981
Yes, it's ladies' night.

760
00:44:07,022 --> 00:44:08,441
Oh, what a night!

761
00:44:09,442 --> 00:44:11,152
Chaka Khan!

762
00:44:11,193 --> 00:44:13,320
Thank you.
This is Jimmy Moore...

763
00:44:13,362 --> 00:44:15,906
saying that ain't
no sock in my crotch.

764
00:44:15,948 --> 00:44:18,284
Take four, everybody.

765
00:44:18,325 --> 00:44:20,327
Jimmy, that was really good.
Thank you.

766
00:44:20,369 --> 00:44:21,454
No. Thank you.

767
00:44:21,495 --> 00:44:24,665
-For what?
-For quitting.

768
00:44:24,707 --> 00:44:28,502
Or...should I thank Linda?

769
00:44:28,544 --> 00:44:31,255
My business has tripled.

770
00:44:32,548 --> 00:44:37,261
You've just inspired
me to hire a D.J...

771
00:44:37,303 --> 00:44:39,013
so thank you.

772
00:44:42,308 --> 00:44:47,104
Good luck finding a D.J. who can
move and shake like this.

773
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:55,571
How did you become
a wedding singer?

774
00:44:56,822 --> 00:44:59,367
I think I got into it
to make some money...

775
00:44:59,408 --> 00:45:01,243
until my music career took off.

776
00:45:01,285 --> 00:45:03,496
And you wanted to be
a rock star?

777
00:45:03,537 --> 00:45:07,708
I kind of just wanted
to be a songwriter, you know?

778
00:45:07,750 --> 00:45:10,211
That's the hardest thing,
to write a song.

779
00:45:10,252 --> 00:45:13,381
A song that
when people hear it...

780
00:45:13,422 --> 00:45:15,758
they go, "Ohh, I know
what that guy was feeling...

781
00:45:15,758 --> 00:45:17,093
"when he wrote that."

782
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:18,260
Have you written anything
lately?

783
00:45:18,302 --> 00:45:20,513
Yeah, I guess.

784
00:45:20,554 --> 00:45:22,098
Will you play it for me?

785
00:45:22,139 --> 00:45:24,016
You don't want to hear it.
It's not good.

786
00:45:24,058 --> 00:45:25,601
I'm sure it is.

787
00:45:25,643 --> 00:45:29,230
I wrote half of it
when I was with Linda...

788
00:45:29,271 --> 00:45:32,066
and I wrote the other half
after we broke up...

789
00:45:32,108 --> 00:45:34,068
so it's a little uneven,
you know?

790
00:45:34,110 --> 00:45:37,196
I don't mind.
I'd like to hear it.

791
00:45:37,238 --> 00:45:39,865
Yeah, all right.

792
00:45:46,247 --> 00:45:50,126
I just want to warn you
that when I wrote this song...

793
00:45:50,126 --> 00:45:52,878
I was listening
to The Cure a lot, so...

794
00:45:54,630 --> 00:45:55,798
Here we go.

795
00:45:57,425 --> 00:46:00,469
You don't know...

796
00:46:00,511 --> 00:46:02,430
How much...

797
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:04,932
I need you.

798
00:46:04,974 --> 00:46:09,645
While you're near me...

799
00:46:09,687 --> 00:46:12,773
I don't feel blue.

800
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:17,153
And when we kiss...

801
00:46:17,194 --> 00:46:21,615
I know you need me, too.

802
00:46:21,615 --> 00:46:25,870
I can't believe
I found a love...

803
00:46:25,911 --> 00:46:30,166
That's so pure and true...

804
00:46:30,207 --> 00:46:33,836
But it all was bullshit.

805
00:46:33,836 --> 00:46:38,299
It was a goddamn joke...

806
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:42,762
And when
I think of you, Linda...

807
00:46:42,803 --> 00:46:46,849
I hope you fuckin' choke.

808
00:46:46,891 --> 00:46:50,978
I hope you're glad...

809
00:46:51,020 --> 00:46:53,939
With what you've done to me.

810
00:46:55,107 --> 00:46:56,817
I lay in bed...

811
00:46:56,859 --> 00:46:58,986
All day long...

812
00:46:59,028 --> 00:47:02,198
Feeling melancholy.

813
00:47:02,239 --> 00:47:05,117
You left me here...

814
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:07,078
All alone...

815
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:10,956
Tears running constantly.

816
00:47:10,998 --> 00:47:15,503
Oh, somebody kill me, please.

817
00:47:19,382 --> 00:47:21,258
I'm on my knees.

818
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,469
Pretty, pretty please.

819
00:47:23,511 --> 00:47:26,514
Kill me.

820
00:47:26,555 --> 00:47:30,142
I want to die.

821
00:47:30,184 --> 00:47:37,817
Put a bullet in my head.

822
00:47:39,235 --> 00:47:40,945
I liked it.

823
00:47:42,947 --> 00:47:45,533
He's losing his mind...

824
00:47:47,076 --> 00:47:49,787
and I'm reaping
all the benefits.

825
00:48:00,756 --> 00:48:04,385
Thank you for the ice cream.
It always cheers me up.

826
00:48:04,468 --> 00:48:06,429
It's my pleasure.

827
00:48:06,429 --> 00:48:07,805
I feel weird
being in this place.

828
00:48:07,847 --> 00:48:11,058
We came here all the time.
We used to get chocolate shakes.

829
00:48:11,100 --> 00:48:13,269
May I ask what happened
with Linda?

830
00:48:13,310 --> 00:48:18,357
She wasn't the right one,
I guess.

831
00:48:18,399 --> 00:48:21,068
Did you have any idea
she wasn't the right one...

832
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:22,778
when you were together?

833
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:25,656
I should have.

834
00:48:28,284 --> 00:48:30,411
I remember we went
to the Grand Canyon once.

835
00:48:30,453 --> 00:48:32,580
We were flying there,
and I'd never been before...

836
00:48:32,621 --> 00:48:35,958
and Linda had,
so you would think...

837
00:48:36,042 --> 00:48:38,377
that she would give me
the window seat...

838
00:48:38,419 --> 00:48:40,129
but she didn't.

839
00:48:40,171 --> 00:48:43,174
Not that that's a big deal,
you know?

840
00:48:43,215 --> 00:48:45,509
But there were a lot of
little things like that.

841
00:48:45,551 --> 00:48:48,137
-l know that sounds stupid.
-Not at all.

842
00:48:48,179 --> 00:48:50,139
I think it's
the little things that count.

843
00:48:50,139 --> 00:48:52,641
How did you know
that Glenn was the right one?

844
00:48:55,978 --> 00:48:57,646
The right one.

845
00:48:57,688 --> 00:49:00,566
I always just envisioned
the right one...

846
00:49:00,608 --> 00:49:03,652
being someone I could
see myself growing old with.

847
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:11,452
And Glenn will be a really
good-looking older man...

848
00:49:11,494 --> 00:49:13,079
like Blake Carrington.

849
00:49:13,120 --> 00:49:15,122
I'm gonna probably
look like Buddy Hackett.

850
00:50:22,588 --> 00:50:24,590
Of course
I'm gonna hire him.

851
00:50:24,631 --> 00:50:27,009
He's your best friend and
the only limo driver in town.

852
00:50:30,095 --> 00:50:31,764
Yeah. I just like
having fun with him.

853
00:50:36,810 --> 00:50:38,979
Wow. Look at him go.

854
00:50:41,774 --> 00:50:43,359
Better move it, man.

855
00:50:45,027 --> 00:50:46,195
You're not gonna make it.

856
00:50:54,244 --> 00:50:56,997
You hit 2 cones.
Those could have been people.

857
00:50:57,039 --> 00:50:58,665
Those could have been
guests at her wedding.

858
00:51:00,793 --> 00:51:02,294
They were cones.

859
00:51:16,934 --> 00:51:19,228
That was fun today.
Wasn't that fun?

860
00:51:19,269 --> 00:51:21,105
That was fun.

861
00:51:21,146 --> 00:51:23,607
-l got the job, right?
-Yeah, you did.

862
00:51:23,607 --> 00:51:26,527
It's August 5th,
a week from today.

863
00:51:26,568 --> 00:51:28,737
Someone left a jacket
in the back.

864
00:51:28,779 --> 00:51:31,198
That's Julia's jacket.

865
00:51:31,240 --> 00:51:34,076
Remember?
She took it off on Noxon Street.

866
00:51:34,118 --> 00:51:35,828
She said it's not
jacket weather anymore.

867
00:51:35,869 --> 00:51:38,914
-Uh-oh.
-What?

868
00:51:38,956 --> 00:51:41,250
-You like her.
-No, I don't.

869
00:51:41,291 --> 00:51:43,919
Of course you do. She's
a cool chick with a hot ass.

870
00:51:43,961 --> 00:51:46,255
You talk about her ass again,
I'll break your neck.

871
00:51:46,296 --> 00:51:49,425
Anyway, she told me
she likes you.

872
00:51:49,466 --> 00:51:51,260
Really?

873
00:51:51,301 --> 00:51:52,636
She said that?

874
00:51:55,389 --> 00:51:56,515
Think about it.

875
00:51:56,557 --> 00:51:58,976
It's gonna be your first
kiss as a married couple.

876
00:51:58,976 --> 00:52:01,061
It's perfectly acceptable
to open your mouth.

877
00:52:01,103 --> 00:52:04,064
I just would not want
to do that in a church...

878
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:06,692
in front of God
and all of our relatives.

879
00:52:06,734 --> 00:52:09,778
It would gross them out
to see me like...

880
00:52:09,820 --> 00:52:13,198
No one will ever solve that.

881
00:52:17,911 --> 00:52:19,955
You forgot
your jacket in the limo.

882
00:52:19,997 --> 00:52:22,124
Thank you for bringing it back.
That's so nice of you.

883
00:52:22,166 --> 00:52:23,917
Yeah, it was.

884
00:52:23,959 --> 00:52:26,879
I'll see you later, all right?
Have fun today.

885
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:28,464
Hey, wait a second.

886
00:52:28,505 --> 00:52:31,842
Maybe...he can help us.

887
00:52:31,884 --> 00:52:33,177
You're the expert on this.

888
00:52:33,218 --> 00:52:35,179
We were just having a debate
about wedding kisses.

889
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:38,807
I say that it's OK for it
to be an open-mouth kiss.

890
00:52:38,849 --> 00:52:41,060
And I say that it's
the type of occasion...

891
00:52:41,101 --> 00:52:43,103
where people dress up,
so it's not appropriate.

892
00:52:43,145 --> 00:52:45,939
-l see.
-What do you want to do?

893
00:52:45,981 --> 00:52:48,650
Thin, tight mouth,
and it's over?

894
00:52:48,692 --> 00:52:52,404
No. Thin, partially open.

895
00:52:52,446 --> 00:52:53,864
No tongues, over.

896
00:52:53,864 --> 00:52:57,326
No tongue? Please. There
has got to be a little.

897
00:52:57,368 --> 00:52:59,244
Maybe a little tongue.

898
00:52:59,286 --> 00:53:01,705
Not porno tongue.
Church tongue.

899
00:53:01,705 --> 00:53:03,499
Church tongue. I like that.

900
00:53:03,540 --> 00:53:05,334
Church tongue? What is that?

901
00:53:05,376 --> 00:53:08,170
I don't know
how to describe it.

902
00:53:08,212 --> 00:53:10,047
Well, show me.

903
00:53:13,384 --> 00:53:16,261
Not on me.
How about on him?

904
00:53:16,303 --> 00:53:19,473
You don't mind, do you?

905
00:53:19,515 --> 00:53:22,226
Come on, just hold still.
Julia, go ahead.

906
00:53:27,898 --> 00:53:29,983
Come on.
We're all adults here.

907
00:53:34,238 --> 00:53:37,491
I'm gonna have to see it
to make an educated decision.

908
00:53:39,743 --> 00:53:42,371
Well, if it's for
educational purposes.

909
00:53:42,413 --> 00:53:45,082
Good. OK.
All right, you ready?

910
00:53:45,124 --> 00:53:48,085
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

911
00:53:48,085 --> 00:53:50,421
You may kiss the bride.

912
00:54:17,781 --> 00:54:19,033
Wow.

913
00:54:19,074 --> 00:54:23,328
That...was...great.

914
00:54:23,370 --> 00:54:25,914
Julia, you should do that
at the wedding.

915
00:54:27,082 --> 00:54:29,960
I gave her the jacket.

916
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:32,713
Hey, Jules. Hey, Holly.

917
00:54:34,048 --> 00:54:36,800
I kissed her,
but it didn't mean anything.

918
00:54:36,884 --> 00:54:39,303
I just brought her the jacket.

919
00:54:40,721 --> 00:54:41,722
Kissed who?

920
00:54:43,265 --> 00:54:44,641
Oh, me.

921
00:54:44,683 --> 00:54:46,310
Who hasn't?

922
00:54:48,562 --> 00:54:53,025
I got you something.
It's called a CD player.

923
00:54:53,067 --> 00:54:54,651
Cost me 700 bucks...

924
00:54:54,693 --> 00:54:57,446
but the sound quality
is outstanding.

925
00:54:57,488 --> 00:54:59,281
You want to play a record?

926
00:54:59,323 --> 00:55:02,826
Jules, it doesn't play records.
It plays CDs.

927
00:55:02,868 --> 00:55:04,995
It's a CD player.

928
00:55:05,037 --> 00:55:06,830
I'll be upstairs hooking it up.

929
00:55:06,872 --> 00:55:12,086
Oh, my God, Robbie
is so amazingly cute.

930
00:55:12,127 --> 00:55:14,505
I think
I should go out with him.

931
00:55:18,676 --> 00:55:20,177
Yeah, why not?

932
00:55:20,219 --> 00:55:23,305
You're single, and he's single.
It makes sense.

933
00:55:25,057 --> 00:55:27,184
If you don't want me to,
I won't do it.

934
00:55:28,686 --> 00:55:30,312
Why would I not want you to?

935
00:55:30,354 --> 00:55:32,398
Good, then I'm going out
with him.

936
00:55:32,439 --> 00:55:34,525
Who you going out with?

937
00:55:35,859 --> 00:55:38,153
Good.
That guy needs to get laid.

938
00:55:38,195 --> 00:55:39,571
Excuse me.

939
00:55:39,613 --> 00:55:42,241
Because he's going out with me
doesn't mean he'll get laid.

940
00:55:45,035 --> 00:55:47,287
All right, he probably will.

941
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:48,664
Do you think
he'll go out with me?

942
00:55:49,957 --> 00:55:52,418
Jules is chums with him.
She'll fix it up, won't you?

943
00:55:52,459 --> 00:55:56,130
You know what would be fun?
Let's go on a double date.

944
00:59:50,731 --> 00:59:53,233
Robbie,
you look so cute tonight.

945
00:59:53,275 --> 00:59:54,818
Thank you.

946
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:57,738
I like these rubber bracelets.
You look like Madonna.

947
00:59:57,738 --> 01:00:00,032
Yeah, that's the idea.

948
01:00:05,537 --> 01:00:06,830
Here you go.

949
01:00:06,830 --> 01:00:09,583
So, Robbie,
how's your business going?

950
01:00:09,625 --> 01:00:13,212
I'm actually working
on a game plan right now.

951
01:00:13,253 --> 01:00:15,339
You should look
into the bond market.

952
01:00:15,380 --> 01:00:17,633
-That's where the money is.
-Glenn's in junk bonds.

953
01:00:17,674 --> 01:00:20,719
No, Jules,
it's high-yield bonds.

954
01:00:20,761 --> 01:00:22,930
Do I tell people
you're in junk waitressing?

955
01:00:24,932 --> 01:00:28,185
My grandmother gave me
a savings bond when I was a kid.

956
01:00:28,227 --> 01:00:33,440
I get $25 in 1993,
so that'll be good.

957
01:00:35,317 --> 01:00:38,195
So we totally
look like a couple.

958
01:00:38,237 --> 01:00:39,947
Don't you think
we look great together?

959
01:00:41,156 --> 01:00:44,785
David Bowie playing.
He's the best.

960
01:00:44,826 --> 01:00:46,453
I think he's coming to town
in September.

961
01:00:46,495 --> 01:00:48,789
I love David Bowie.

962
01:00:49,998 --> 01:00:52,459
When I get excited...

963
01:00:52,501 --> 01:00:55,629
My little China girl...

964
01:00:55,671 --> 01:01:00,509
She says, "Oh, baby,
just you shut your mouth."

965
01:01:01,843 --> 01:01:03,637
Shut your mouth. All right.

966
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:05,472
We all know the words.

967
01:01:05,514 --> 01:01:08,475
God, I love David Bowie.
He is so sexy.

968
01:01:08,517 --> 01:01:10,978
You think the "time to make
the donuts" guy is sexy.

969
01:01:11,061 --> 01:01:13,605
That guy is funny.

970
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:16,316
You know who else
I think is sexy?

971
01:01:20,779 --> 01:01:22,322
That's good.
Thank you very much.

972
01:01:22,364 --> 01:01:23,657
I gotta go to the bathroom.

973
01:01:23,699 --> 01:01:27,744
Excuse us, guys.
We'll be right back.

974
01:01:29,538 --> 01:01:31,582
She'll feel better
once she yaks.

975
01:01:31,623 --> 01:01:34,167
I hope so.

976
01:01:43,677 --> 01:01:44,845
So...

977
01:01:46,054 --> 01:01:47,931
Sunday's the big day, huh?

978
01:01:47,973 --> 01:01:49,433
I don't even know
your last name.

979
01:01:49,474 --> 01:01:50,851
It's Gulia.

980
01:01:53,812 --> 01:01:56,231
Julia's last name
is gonna be Gulia.

981
01:01:56,231 --> 01:01:58,317
Julia Gulia. That's funny.

982
01:01:58,358 --> 01:02:00,235
Why is that funny?

983
01:02:01,904 --> 01:02:03,989
I don't know.

984
01:02:09,369 --> 01:02:10,829
Are you excited?

985
01:02:12,915 --> 01:02:15,209
Yeah. She's paid her dues,
been with me four years.

986
01:02:15,250 --> 01:02:17,169
I owe it to her to get married.

987
01:02:17,252 --> 01:02:19,796
You had the Long Island
iced tea.

988
01:02:19,838 --> 01:02:23,425
Plus, you know, you probably...

989
01:02:23,467 --> 01:02:24,760
you want to get married.

990
01:02:26,553 --> 01:02:28,430
I don't want to break up.

991
01:02:28,472 --> 01:02:30,057
Plus, she was with me
before I made my money...

992
01:02:30,098 --> 01:02:31,225
so I know I can trust her.

993
01:02:39,149 --> 01:02:41,902
That is a luscious ass
right there, isn't it?

994
01:02:41,944 --> 01:02:43,362
My God.

995
01:02:45,405 --> 01:02:47,658
That's Grade-A,
top-choice meat.

996
01:02:47,699 --> 01:02:50,744
Like to bite
right through that thing.

997
01:02:50,786 --> 01:02:52,412
Chew on it.

998
01:02:52,454 --> 01:02:54,540
But we can't get chicks
like that anymore.

999
01:02:54,581 --> 01:02:55,832
We're too old.

1000
01:02:55,874 --> 01:02:57,709
Speak for yourself.
I'm not too old.

1001
01:02:57,751 --> 01:02:59,086
I can still get chicks
like that.

1002
01:02:59,127 --> 01:03:01,505
Not that hot, though, right?

1003
01:03:02,673 --> 01:03:04,550
I've gotten hotter.

1004
01:03:04,591 --> 01:03:06,051
10 years ago.

1005
01:03:07,386 --> 01:03:09,888
Try 10 days ago.

1006
01:03:11,056 --> 01:03:12,766
Really?

1007
01:03:12,808 --> 01:03:14,351
As hot as that?

1008
01:03:15,852 --> 01:03:18,397
Hotter and younger.

1009
01:03:19,731 --> 01:03:21,942
How do you do it, man?

1010
01:03:21,984 --> 01:03:23,902
How do you do it
without getting caught?

1011
01:03:26,321 --> 01:03:28,657
Julia is totally preoccupied
with the wedding.

1012
01:03:28,699 --> 01:03:30,200
She doesn't know
what's going on.

1013
01:03:30,242 --> 01:03:32,578
Oh, man.

1014
01:03:32,619 --> 01:03:34,663
You know what sucks, though?

1015
01:03:34,705 --> 01:03:38,292
Once you get married,
the party's over, right?

1016
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:39,877
I work in the city, man.

1017
01:03:41,044 --> 01:03:42,796
And I work long hours.

1018
01:03:44,006 --> 01:03:46,008
Yeah, that's something.

1019
01:03:48,135 --> 01:03:50,679
Julia's feeling
a little under the weather.

1020
01:03:50,721 --> 01:03:52,222
Told you she was gonna yak.

1021
01:03:52,264 --> 01:03:54,683
Yeah, you called it.

1022
01:03:54,683 --> 01:03:57,102
Why don't you go get your car
and meet us out front?

1023
01:04:03,150 --> 01:04:04,818
Oh, God. I forgot my purse.

1024
01:04:04,860 --> 01:04:07,613
Do me a favor and put her
in the car with Glenn.

1025
01:04:07,654 --> 01:04:09,615
-No problem.
-It's OK.

1026
01:04:13,702 --> 01:04:15,204
I puked.

1027
01:04:15,245 --> 01:04:17,873
OK. Don't worry.

1028
01:04:17,915 --> 01:04:19,666
I vomited in my hair.

1029
01:04:19,708 --> 01:04:20,834
All right.

1030
01:04:20,876 --> 01:04:23,545
Does my hair smell bad?

1031
01:04:28,091 --> 01:04:30,010
No, it smells good, actually.

1032
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:33,764
Just feel better, all right?

1033
01:04:40,395 --> 01:04:42,272
Hi, Glenn.

1034
01:04:46,735 --> 01:04:48,487
Don't puke in the car,
all right?

1035
01:04:50,113 --> 01:04:51,406
It'll stink for a week.

1036
01:05:17,224 --> 01:05:20,686
What do you think of Glenn?
Do you think he's trustworthy?

1037
01:05:20,769 --> 01:05:22,646
Yeah, he better be.

1038
01:05:23,939 --> 01:05:25,107
Who cares about Glenn?

1039
01:05:26,984 --> 01:05:28,443
You know what
I keep thinking about?

1040
01:05:28,443 --> 01:05:29,861
What?

1041
01:05:29,903 --> 01:05:33,073
That soft kiss
from the other day.

1042
01:05:34,283 --> 01:05:36,243
It looked really nice.

1043
01:05:38,871 --> 01:05:40,414
Did it feel good?

1044
01:05:42,958 --> 01:05:45,252
I don't know.

1045
01:05:45,294 --> 01:05:46,545
I don't remember.

1046
01:05:46,587 --> 01:05:49,339
Could I refresh your memory?

1047
01:06:01,602 --> 01:06:02,769
Yummy.

1048
01:06:06,273 --> 01:06:09,401
So you know Julia's
staying at Glenn's tonight.

1049
01:06:12,279 --> 01:06:15,949
Look, Robbie,
I know that you're shy...

1050
01:06:15,991 --> 01:06:18,285
and I know
that you've been hurt...

1051
01:06:18,327 --> 01:06:23,123
so I'm gonna make this
really easy on you.

1052
01:06:24,333 --> 01:06:27,961
If you come upstairs,
you're gonna get laid.

1053
01:06:28,003 --> 01:06:29,880
Wow.

1054
01:06:31,048 --> 01:06:33,634
Nobody's ever said that
to me before.

1055
01:06:35,761 --> 01:06:37,638
I just--I'm telling you...

1056
01:06:37,679 --> 01:06:39,556
my head's kind of a mess
right now.

1057
01:06:41,516 --> 01:06:43,936
Julia's staying
at Glenn's tonight, huh?

1058
01:06:45,479 --> 01:06:46,688
Does she stay over there a lot?

1059
01:06:49,358 --> 01:06:50,609
Really?

1060
01:06:54,196 --> 01:06:56,406
Oh, my God.

1061
01:06:56,448 --> 01:06:57,449
What?

1062
01:06:57,491 --> 01:07:00,661
I can't believe
I never noticed it before.

1063
01:07:04,581 --> 01:07:06,542
You've got a thing for Julia.

1064
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:09,169
Oh, no, I don't.

1065
01:07:09,211 --> 01:07:10,546
I think she's
a very nice girl...

1066
01:07:10,587 --> 01:07:12,839
but she's marrying
that jerk-off.

1067
01:07:12,881 --> 01:07:16,176
You know why
she's marrying him, don't you?

1068
01:07:19,471 --> 01:07:21,723
The money thing?

1069
01:07:21,765 --> 01:07:24,268
Security? A nice house?

1070
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:26,520
I guess that's important
to some people.

1071
01:07:26,562 --> 01:07:28,814
No, it's...

1072
01:07:28,814 --> 01:07:32,526
It's not important
to some people, Robbie.

1073
01:07:32,568 --> 01:07:34,194
It's important to all people.

1074
01:07:34,236 --> 01:07:38,115
Really? Then I guess
I'm in big trouble.

1075
01:07:38,156 --> 01:07:40,367
Morning, sunshine.

1076
01:07:43,287 --> 01:07:45,414
I have a bad headache.

1077
01:07:45,455 --> 01:07:47,082
A really bad headache.

1078
01:07:47,165 --> 01:07:49,251
Can I cook you
some breakfast?

1079
01:07:52,296 --> 01:07:55,215
How was your bottle of rum
last night?

1080
01:07:57,593 --> 01:07:59,803
I didn't vomit on you, did l?

1081
01:08:01,513 --> 01:08:05,934
A little on my shoe,
but I was wearing your shoes.

1082
01:08:05,976 --> 01:08:07,269
Good.

1083
01:08:09,730 --> 01:08:12,816
So, did anything happen
with Robbie last night?

1084
01:08:16,069 --> 01:08:19,114
A kiss.

1085
01:08:19,156 --> 01:08:21,158
Did you kiss him,
or did he kiss you?

1086
01:08:21,200 --> 01:08:23,493
I kissed him.

1087
01:08:23,535 --> 01:08:24,578
And then what?

1088
01:08:24,620 --> 01:08:26,079
Nothing.

1089
01:08:28,749 --> 01:08:32,836
He sure doesn't
think much of Glenn, though.

1090
01:08:32,878 --> 01:08:35,088
Really? What did he say?

1091
01:08:35,130 --> 01:08:37,382
That Glenn's a jerk-off.

1092
01:08:41,136 --> 01:08:43,096
Why would he say that?

1093
01:08:43,096 --> 01:08:45,849
Who knows?
Maybe he was jealous.

1094
01:08:45,891 --> 01:08:50,103
Don't worry. I told him
why you were marrying him.

1095
01:08:50,145 --> 01:08:52,689
Why did you tell him
I was marrying him?

1096
01:08:52,731 --> 01:08:54,900
Because you love him...

1097
01:08:54,942 --> 01:08:59,613
and because...

1098
01:08:59,655 --> 01:09:01,823
because with Glenn,
you'll have security.

1099
01:09:02,991 --> 01:09:04,952
But that's not
why I'm marrying him.

1100
01:09:07,204 --> 01:09:08,914
Then why are you?

1101
01:09:25,013 --> 01:09:27,349
Hi, Rosie. How are you?

1102
01:09:27,391 --> 01:09:28,600
Fine, dear.

1103
01:09:28,642 --> 01:09:31,103
Is Robbie here?
I came by to give him something.

1104
01:09:31,144 --> 01:09:34,273
No, Julia.
I'm afraid he's not.

1105
01:09:34,314 --> 01:09:37,317
But it's Thursday.
You have singing lessons today.

1106
01:09:37,359 --> 01:09:39,027
Not anymore.

1107
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:41,321
Now that he's gone to the city
to get a real job...

1108
01:09:41,363 --> 01:09:43,949
he doesn't have time
to give me lessons.

1109
01:09:43,991 --> 01:09:46,326
Why do you think you'd be
a good hire for this bank?

1110
01:09:46,368 --> 01:09:48,120
I'm ready to work hard...

1111
01:09:48,161 --> 01:09:50,956
and when I put my mind
to something, I go all the way.

1112
01:09:50,998 --> 01:09:52,416
I'll go all the way
for you, sir.

1113
01:09:53,709 --> 01:09:55,002
Do you have any experience?

1114
01:09:55,043 --> 01:09:58,714
I have no experience,
but I'm a big fan of money.

1115
01:09:58,755 --> 01:10:02,009
I like it. I use it.
I have a little.

1116
01:10:02,050 --> 01:10:04,386
I keep it in a jar
on top of my refrigerator.

1117
01:10:04,428 --> 01:10:06,847
I'd like to put more in it.
That's where you come in.

1118
01:10:09,349 --> 01:10:11,184
He wants to make money.

1119
01:10:11,226 --> 01:10:17,649
Live in a nice house
with wide windows and lamps.

1120
01:10:17,733 --> 01:10:21,069
You can't expect him to live
forever with his sister...

1121
01:10:21,111 --> 01:10:24,281
and the nipple-twisting
that goes on there.

1122
01:10:24,323 --> 01:10:25,866
I thank you for your time.

1123
01:10:25,908 --> 01:10:28,827
Actually, sir, I need this job
to impress a girl.

1124
01:10:28,869 --> 01:10:30,537
Will you leave now, please?

1125
01:10:30,579 --> 01:10:32,372
You don't even have
to give me the job.

1126
01:10:32,414 --> 01:10:34,541
If you could give me some cards
with my name on it...

1127
01:10:34,583 --> 01:10:35,667
I think that might help.

1128
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:38,295
I'm gonna try
and go look for him, OK?

1129
01:10:38,337 --> 01:10:40,380
Tell him I'll give him a raise.

1130
01:10:40,422 --> 01:10:42,966
Three meatballs a lesson.

1131
01:10:43,008 --> 01:10:44,468
How about this?

1132
01:10:44,509 --> 01:10:47,054
10 singing lessons
for one business card.

1133
01:10:47,095 --> 01:10:49,097
Thank you very much.

1134
01:11:12,788 --> 01:11:15,082
Hey, Julia.
What are you doing here?

1135
01:11:15,123 --> 01:11:18,085
I went by Rosie's to find you.

1136
01:11:18,126 --> 01:11:21,380
I'm not doing that anymore.

1137
01:11:21,421 --> 01:11:25,676
I thought that teaching
was a big part of your life.

1138
01:11:25,717 --> 01:11:28,303
It was, but now I'm doing
some stuff...

1139
01:11:28,345 --> 01:11:30,931
to better my situation.

1140
01:11:30,973 --> 01:11:32,474
Sounds kind of selfish.

1141
01:11:33,892 --> 01:11:36,395
It's not selfish. There's
a lot of money out there.

1142
01:11:36,436 --> 01:11:37,688
I'm trying to get
my hands on some.

1143
01:11:37,729 --> 01:11:40,440
But you don't want to be
just another yuppie idiot.

1144
01:11:40,482 --> 01:11:41,775
What's wrong with that?

1145
01:11:41,817 --> 01:11:44,528
Don't want to live in
my sister's basement anymore.

1146
01:11:44,570 --> 01:11:47,197
I want to get a big house,
have some security.

1147
01:11:48,490 --> 01:11:50,951
Can't do that doing favors
for people all the time...

1148
01:11:50,993 --> 01:11:52,286
getting paid in meatballs.

1149
01:11:52,327 --> 01:11:54,454
But you're above
all that material bullshit.

1150
01:11:54,496 --> 01:11:57,457
I don't know. We're living
in a material world...

1151
01:11:57,499 --> 01:12:00,335
and I am a material girl.
Or boy.

1152
01:12:00,377 --> 01:12:02,546
No, you're not.

1153
01:12:02,588 --> 01:12:04,715
What about you?
You're into material shit.

1154
01:12:06,341 --> 01:12:07,467
What do you mean?

1155
01:12:07,509 --> 01:12:09,928
You're marrying Glenn
'cause he's got money.

1156
01:12:18,562 --> 01:12:20,314
You asshole.

1157
01:12:32,326 --> 01:12:35,787
Oh, my gosh.
She made me a present.

1158
01:12:35,871 --> 01:12:37,873
I am an asshole!

1159
01:12:40,375 --> 01:12:42,753
You're going
to the mental institution.

1160
01:12:42,794 --> 01:12:43,795
Beat it!

1161
01:13:07,611 --> 01:13:09,905
-Rudy.
-Same?

1162
01:13:09,905 --> 01:13:12,032
Give me the same, please.

1163
01:13:15,285 --> 01:13:16,411
What's up?

1164
01:13:16,453 --> 01:13:18,413
-There he is.
-You all right?

1165
01:13:18,455 --> 01:13:20,999
You know something?

1166
01:13:21,041 --> 01:13:22,709
You were right.
You've always been right.

1167
01:13:22,751 --> 01:13:25,128
What have I been so right about?

1168
01:13:25,170 --> 01:13:29,007
Women.
You just have fun with them.

1169
01:13:29,049 --> 01:13:31,385
You get emotionally involved,
and they end up...

1170
01:13:31,426 --> 01:13:32,678
What do they do to you?

1171
01:13:34,555 --> 01:13:37,724
They rip your heart
out of your ass.

1172
01:13:37,766 --> 01:13:39,393
That's right.

1173
01:13:39,434 --> 01:13:42,062
Did something happen with Julia?

1174
01:13:42,104 --> 01:13:45,232
I went on
that double date, right?

1175
01:13:45,274 --> 01:13:47,609
And the moron
she's gonna marry...

1176
01:13:47,609 --> 01:13:50,445
actually tells me
he cheats on her.

1177
01:13:50,487 --> 01:13:52,489
But can I tell her?

1178
01:13:52,531 --> 01:13:55,075
No. Who am l
to break up a marriage?

1179
01:13:55,117 --> 01:13:57,911
You need a prostitute.

1180
01:14:02,833 --> 01:14:06,461
Anyways...I'm confused.

1181
01:14:06,503 --> 01:14:08,630
Because you like her.

1182
01:14:11,049 --> 01:14:13,886
I think I'm in love with her.

1183
01:14:15,888 --> 01:14:18,599
But I gotta get that
out of my head, you know?

1184
01:14:21,852 --> 01:14:24,479
From now on,
I'm gonna be like you.

1185
01:14:24,521 --> 01:14:26,773
I'm gonna be with
a different chick every night...

1186
01:14:26,815 --> 01:14:28,317
and then I'll send them packin'.

1187
01:14:28,317 --> 01:14:30,944
Sounds like you got it
all figured out.

1188
01:14:30,986 --> 01:14:34,781
I'm gonna have to give them
cab money to go home...

1189
01:14:34,823 --> 01:14:35,991
because I'll feel bad
if I don't...

1190
01:14:36,033 --> 01:14:37,826
but after that,
it's Bye-Bye, Birdie.

1191
01:14:39,661 --> 01:14:42,164
That's it, man,
starting right now.

1192
01:14:42,164 --> 01:14:45,667
We are gonna be free and happy
the rest of our lives.

1193
01:14:50,797 --> 01:14:53,759
I'm not happy.
I'm miserable.

1194
01:14:53,842 --> 01:14:55,636
What?

1195
01:14:55,677 --> 01:14:58,972
I grew up idolizing guys...

1196
01:14:59,014 --> 01:15:01,308
like Fonzie
and Vinnie Barbarino...

1197
01:15:01,350 --> 01:15:02,851
'cause they got
a lot of chicks.

1198
01:15:02,851 --> 01:15:05,854
You know what happened to Fonzie
and Vinnie Barbarino?

1199
01:15:05,854 --> 01:15:09,399
I read that Fonzie
wants to be a director...

1200
01:15:09,441 --> 01:15:13,070
and Barbarino, I think,
the mechanical bull movie.

1201
01:15:13,111 --> 01:15:14,238
I didn't see it yet.

1202
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:19,159
Their shows got canceled
'cause no one wants to see

1203
01:15:19,201 --> 01:15:21,745
a 50-year-old guy
hitting on chicks.

1204
01:15:23,247 --> 01:15:24,581
What are you saying?

1205
01:15:24,623 --> 01:15:27,376
What I'm saying is,
all I really want...

1206
01:15:27,376 --> 01:15:29,878
is someone to hold me...

1207
01:15:29,878 --> 01:15:34,550
and tell me that everything
is gonna be all right.

1208
01:15:35,551 --> 01:15:38,845
Everything is
gonna be all right.

1209
01:15:42,891 --> 01:15:44,601
If you found someone
you can love...

1210
01:15:44,643 --> 01:15:46,853
you can't let her get away.

1211
01:15:48,647 --> 01:15:51,942
You're right, man.
Thank you, Sammy.

1212
01:15:51,984 --> 01:15:53,777
Don't tell anyone what I said.

1213
01:15:57,531 --> 01:15:59,491
Mom.

1214
01:16:00,701 --> 01:16:02,786
Do you really like Glenn?

1215
01:16:02,828 --> 01:16:05,706
Oh, sure, honey.
What's not to like?

1216
01:16:05,747 --> 01:16:07,708
He's rich, he's charming,
he's handsome...

1217
01:16:07,749 --> 01:16:11,086
and now he's really got it all
'cause he's got you.

1218
01:16:14,548 --> 01:16:16,633
Honey, what's the matter?

1219
01:16:18,594 --> 01:16:21,722
I don't know if
I'm in love with him anymore.

1220
01:16:21,763 --> 01:16:25,017
Why? What happened?

1221
01:16:28,687 --> 01:16:32,065
I just don't know
if he's the right guy for me.

1222
01:16:33,859 --> 01:16:36,069
And I've been spending
a lot of time...

1223
01:16:36,111 --> 01:16:39,239
with this other man,
Robbie Hart.

1224
01:16:39,281 --> 01:16:42,576
The wedding singer?

1225
01:16:42,618 --> 01:16:45,537
You're thinking of leaving
Glenn for the wedding singer?

1226
01:16:46,955 --> 01:16:49,082
I don't know
what I'm thinking.

1227
01:16:49,124 --> 01:16:50,417
I'm confused.

1228
01:16:50,459 --> 01:16:52,794
I know, sweetie.

1229
01:16:52,836 --> 01:16:56,089
You've got what is known
as the jitters, cold feet.

1230
01:16:56,131 --> 01:16:59,509
Everybody has 'em. I had 'em.

1231
01:16:59,551 --> 01:17:01,345
Course, I should have run
screaming down the street...

1232
01:17:01,386 --> 01:17:04,431
instead of marrying your father,
but Glenn is different.

1233
01:17:04,473 --> 01:17:05,599
He's a keeper.

1234
01:17:07,768 --> 01:17:10,479
You're gonna marry Glenn
on Sunday.

1235
01:17:10,520 --> 01:17:12,397
You're gonna love him...

1236
01:17:12,439 --> 01:17:14,399
and everything's
gonna be wonderful.

1237
01:17:18,111 --> 01:17:20,489
Where's your veil?
It's downstairs.

1238
01:17:20,531 --> 01:17:21,823
I'll go get it.

1239
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,936
Hi. Nice to meet you.

1240
01:17:51,019 --> 01:17:52,771
I'm Mrs. Glenn Gulia.

1241
01:17:55,399 --> 01:17:59,862
Hello. It's nice to meet you.
I'm Julia Gulia.

1242
01:18:04,074 --> 01:18:06,076
Right when I wake up
in the morning...

1243
01:18:06,118 --> 01:18:08,328
you're the first person
that pops in my head.

1244
01:18:08,370 --> 01:18:11,164
I keep thinking
about you over and over.

1245
01:18:11,206 --> 01:18:15,419
It's nice to meet you.
I'm Mrs. Julia Gulia.

1246
01:18:25,637 --> 01:18:28,140
I'm pleased to meet you.

1247
01:18:28,223 --> 01:18:29,933
I'm Mrs. Robbie Hart.

1248
01:18:31,393 --> 01:18:34,187
Robbie and I are so pleased
you could come to our wedding.

1249
01:19:11,808 --> 01:19:13,060
Pretty good?

1250
01:19:15,103 --> 01:19:16,271
What happened?

1251
01:19:16,313 --> 01:19:20,067
She just looked way too happy.
I couldn't do it.

1252
01:19:20,108 --> 01:19:22,986
I'm sorry, man.

1253
01:19:23,028 --> 01:19:25,739
Hey, Rudy. Get Robbie a double.

1254
01:19:25,781 --> 01:19:28,283
Actually, Rudy,
don't even worry about it.

1255
01:19:28,283 --> 01:19:29,576
I brought my own.

1256
01:19:29,618 --> 01:19:31,787
You can't drink that in here.

1257
01:19:31,787 --> 01:19:33,914
All right.

1258
01:19:33,956 --> 01:19:37,042
I'll finish up in the alley.
Are you guys coming?

1259
01:19:46,468 --> 01:19:49,471
It's the wedding singer.

1260
01:19:49,513 --> 01:19:51,473
Hey, Glenn. What's up?

1261
01:19:51,515 --> 01:19:54,518
I heard you couldn't
close the deal with Holly.

1262
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:56,478
What's the matter with that?
You're not...

1263
01:19:56,478 --> 01:19:58,480
You like women, right?

1264
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,315
Not as much as you do, I guess.

1265
01:20:00,357 --> 01:20:03,151
We're gonna have a little
pre-bachelor party.

1266
01:20:03,193 --> 01:20:05,404
You want to come
and have a beer?

1267
01:20:05,445 --> 01:20:06,613
You're ridiculous, man.

1268
01:20:08,115 --> 01:20:10,951
Stop all this
cheating shit, moron.

1269
01:20:10,993 --> 01:20:12,119
She's a good girl.

1270
01:20:12,160 --> 01:20:13,704
Hey, asswipe...

1271
01:20:15,455 --> 01:20:17,124
don't go snitchin'
to Julia about this.

1272
01:20:17,165 --> 01:20:19,668
I know you got
some little crush on her...

1273
01:20:19,668 --> 01:20:21,879
but you gotta face the facts.

1274
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:24,172
She'd rather go to bed
with a real man...

1275
01:20:24,214 --> 01:20:25,549
not some poor singing orphan.

1276
01:20:28,468 --> 01:20:31,054
All right, shithead.
I haven't been in a fight...

1277
01:20:31,096 --> 01:20:32,723
since I was
in the fifth grade...

1278
01:20:32,764 --> 01:20:35,058
but I beat the shit
out of that kid...

1279
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,810
so now I'm gonna beat
the shit out of you.

1280
01:20:38,478 --> 01:20:40,522
What are you doing?

1281
01:20:40,564 --> 01:20:42,566
I'm sorry.

1282
01:20:42,608 --> 01:20:44,776
I used to be much stronger.

1283
01:20:52,701 --> 01:20:54,328
Why don't you write
a song about this?

1284
01:20:54,369 --> 01:20:55,787
You can call it...

1285
01:20:55,829 --> 01:20:58,498
"l got punched in the nose...

1286
01:20:58,540 --> 01:21:01,043
"for stickin' my face
in other people's business."

1287
01:21:05,589 --> 01:21:07,424
Way to go.

1288
01:21:07,466 --> 01:21:09,968
Sounds like a country song.

1289
01:21:25,192 --> 01:21:27,986
Kiss my grits.

1290
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:38,872
I can see that you're drunk,
and that's OK.

1291
01:21:38,914 --> 01:21:41,124
I'm still gonna tell you this.

1292
01:21:41,124 --> 01:21:43,627
I really miss you,
and I want to come back.

1293
01:21:45,295 --> 01:21:47,422
I don't want
to be alone anymore.

1294
01:21:49,424 --> 01:21:51,677
You're not alone anymore.

1295
01:21:51,718 --> 01:21:53,512
Linda's back.

1296
01:22:37,472 --> 01:22:39,683
Can I help you?

1297
01:22:43,103 --> 01:22:44,396
Is Robbie here?

1298
01:22:46,231 --> 01:22:48,233
I'm afraid he's indisposed.

1299
01:22:52,029 --> 01:22:53,197
Shower.

1300
01:22:57,701 --> 01:22:59,244
You must be Linda.

1301
01:22:59,286 --> 01:23:02,748
Yeah, that's me...
Robbie's fiancee.

1302
01:23:02,789 --> 01:23:04,750
Who are you?

1303
01:23:04,791 --> 01:23:06,043
I'm Julia Sullivan.

1304
01:23:08,086 --> 01:23:10,422
Would you tell him
that I came by to see him?

1305
01:23:10,464 --> 01:23:12,799
Oh, yeah,
surely will, Jennifer.

1306
01:23:12,841 --> 01:23:14,218
It's Julia.

1307
01:23:31,735 --> 01:23:34,404
Wake up, sleepyhead.

1308
01:23:34,446 --> 01:23:37,324
This is the first day
of our new life together.

1309
01:23:39,743 --> 01:23:40,869
Wake me up...

1310
01:23:40,911 --> 01:23:42,871
Before you go-go.

1311
01:23:42,913 --> 01:23:46,875
Don't leave me hanging on
like a solo.

1312
01:23:58,220 --> 01:23:59,471
What are you doing here?

1313
01:24:01,223 --> 01:24:05,018
Well, you passed out,
so I took care of you.

1314
01:24:05,060 --> 01:24:07,521
What?
Why'd you take care of me?

1315
01:24:09,231 --> 01:24:12,359
I told you last night.
I realized I was wrong...

1316
01:24:12,401 --> 01:24:14,528
and I want to take
care of you for good.

1317
01:24:14,570 --> 01:24:15,696
I can learn
to deal with the fact...

1318
01:24:15,737 --> 01:24:19,032
that you're a wedding singer
and not a rock star.

1319
01:24:19,074 --> 01:24:20,868
You can learn to deal with that?

1320
01:24:20,909 --> 01:24:23,912
I don't want you to learn
to deal with that.

1321
01:24:23,912 --> 01:24:27,082
That's not how it works. Jeez!

1322
01:24:30,085 --> 01:24:32,671
Maybe we should talk about this
when you're feeling better.

1323
01:24:32,713 --> 01:24:35,048
Hey, psycho...

1324
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:36,884
I'm not gonna feel
better about this.

1325
01:24:36,925 --> 01:24:38,677
It's over.

1326
01:24:38,719 --> 01:24:41,054
Now please get out
of my Van Halen t-shirt...

1327
01:24:41,096 --> 01:24:43,348
before you jinx the band
and they break up.

1328
01:24:48,103 --> 01:24:50,355
So you're still pissed
about that wedding thing.

1329
01:25:03,577 --> 01:25:04,620
Glenn, good morning.

1330
01:25:09,583 --> 01:25:11,710
Hey, baby.

1331
01:25:11,752 --> 01:25:13,795
You gonna make breakfast in bed?

1332
01:25:15,505 --> 01:25:18,300
Actually, I've been doing
some thinking, and...

1333
01:25:19,801 --> 01:25:21,929
I don't need a big wedding...

1334
01:25:21,970 --> 01:25:24,181
and I think
that I've been really selfish...

1335
01:25:24,223 --> 01:25:27,684
making you do something
you don't even want to do.

1336
01:25:30,145 --> 01:25:31,647
You wanna go to Vegas?

1337
01:25:34,942 --> 01:25:37,569
All right. Let's go.

1338
01:25:40,155 --> 01:25:43,408
There were bells...

1339
01:25:43,492 --> 01:25:46,453
On a hill...

1340
01:25:46,537 --> 01:25:52,251
But I never heard them ringing.

1341
01:25:52,292 --> 01:25:56,755
No, I never heard
them at all...

1342
01:25:56,797 --> 01:26:02,302
'Til there was you.

1343
01:26:03,845 --> 01:26:08,559
And there was music...

1344
01:26:08,600 --> 01:26:13,730
And there were wonderful roses.

1345
01:26:13,772 --> 01:26:16,650
They tell me...

1346
01:26:16,692 --> 01:26:18,652
In sweet...

1347
01:26:18,694 --> 01:26:22,322
Fragrant meadows...

1348
01:26:22,364 --> 01:26:29,371
Of dawn and dew.

1349
01:26:29,413 --> 01:26:31,957
There was love...

1350
01:26:31,999 --> 01:26:33,000
All around...

1351
01:26:33,041 --> 01:26:36,879
Flight number 1156
is now ready for boarding.

1352
01:26:36,920 --> 01:26:41,425
We'd like to ask passengers
traveling with small children...

1353
01:26:41,466 --> 01:26:46,513
I never heard it at all...

1354
01:26:46,555 --> 01:26:53,395
'Til there was you.

1355
01:26:53,437 --> 01:26:55,314
I just always
envisioned the right one...

1356
01:26:55,355 --> 01:26:57,566
being someone
I could grow old with.

1357
01:27:04,364 --> 01:27:06,783
I know. I'll go get the car.

1358
01:27:08,243 --> 01:27:10,787
Rosie, congratulations.

1359
01:27:10,829 --> 01:27:12,164
I gotta go take care
of something, OK?

1360
01:27:12,206 --> 01:27:14,875
I know you do. Go get her.

1361
01:27:14,917 --> 01:27:16,877
All right.

1362
01:27:16,919 --> 01:27:18,462
-l need to talk to you.
-l can't talk right now.

1363
01:27:18,503 --> 01:27:21,715
-Are you back with Linda?
-No. Who said that?

1364
01:27:21,757 --> 01:27:24,343
Julia.
She went to your house...

1365
01:27:24,384 --> 01:27:26,220
to tell you she was
falling for you...

1366
01:27:26,261 --> 01:27:28,263
and Linda answered the door
in her underwear.

1367
01:27:28,263 --> 01:27:29,640
She was so upset...

1368
01:27:29,681 --> 01:27:31,516
she and Glenn
jumped a plane to Vegas.

1369
01:27:31,558 --> 01:27:33,685
What do you mean? They're
getting married tomorrow.

1370
01:27:33,727 --> 01:27:36,021
Apparently,
that wasn't soon enough.

1371
01:27:38,190 --> 01:27:39,191
I said, hip, hop...

1372
01:27:39,274 --> 01:27:41,360
A-hippie to the hippie
to the hip, hip, hop.

1373
01:27:41,401 --> 01:27:43,612
You don't stop rockin'
to the bang, bang boogie...

1374
01:27:43,612 --> 01:27:44,863
Say, up comes the boogie...

1375
01:27:44,905 --> 01:27:46,323
To the rhythm
of the boogie that beats.

1376
01:27:46,365 --> 01:27:48,367
We're now ready
for our general boarding.

1377
01:27:48,450 --> 01:27:50,285
That's it, sweetie.
Ready to go?

1378
01:27:52,246 --> 01:27:55,332
This is a great idea.
I'm glad you came around.

1379
01:27:55,374 --> 01:27:57,376
You want to do some
gambling and fun right away...

1380
01:27:57,417 --> 01:27:58,585
or just get married?

1381
01:27:58,627 --> 01:28:00,504
I just want to get married.

1382
01:28:00,546 --> 01:28:02,422
You're never going to find her.

1383
01:28:02,464 --> 01:28:04,633
There's got to be a million
wedding chapels in Vegas.

1384
01:28:04,675 --> 01:28:06,843
-Does anybody have a pen?
-What for?

1385
01:28:06,885 --> 01:28:08,387
I got a good idea for a song.

1386
01:28:08,428 --> 01:28:10,889
-Here.
-Thank you.

1387
01:28:15,936 --> 01:28:17,145
Thank you.

1388
01:28:17,229 --> 01:28:18,230
Hey, I'm sorry.

1389
01:28:18,272 --> 01:28:19,940
Can I help you?

1390
01:28:19,982 --> 01:28:21,942
I need a ticket
for Las Vegas, please.

1391
01:28:23,861 --> 01:28:26,947
We only have one seat left
in our first-class section.

1392
01:28:26,989 --> 01:28:28,448
The next flight
leaves in the morning.

1393
01:28:29,825 --> 01:28:32,077
Can I borrow
your credit card?

1394
01:28:32,119 --> 01:28:33,954
You're going
to pay me back, right?

1395
01:28:33,996 --> 01:28:35,998
No, but if you don't
give it to me...

1396
01:28:36,039 --> 01:28:39,710
I'm going to tell everybody
what you said at the bar.

1397
01:28:39,751 --> 01:28:40,919
Thanks.

1398
01:28:40,961 --> 01:28:43,130
That was really nice of you.

1399
01:28:43,171 --> 01:28:44,339
Thanks.

1400
01:28:44,381 --> 01:28:46,341
Do you like
Flock of Seagulls?

1401
01:28:46,383 --> 01:28:48,635
I can see you do.

1402
01:28:48,677 --> 01:28:50,137
-Wish me luck.
-Go get her!

1403
01:29:01,815 --> 01:29:03,150
Do you mind
if we switched seats...

1404
01:29:03,192 --> 01:29:04,610
and I sat in the window seat?

1405
01:29:06,570 --> 01:29:08,155
I hate the aisle seat.

1406
01:29:08,197 --> 01:29:10,949
Every time that cart comes by,
it bangs me in the elbows.

1407
01:29:10,991 --> 01:29:14,953
Your arms are smaller
than mine, Jules.

1408
01:29:14,995 --> 01:29:19,166
I know. I just never saw
the lights of Vegas before.

1409
01:29:20,959 --> 01:29:22,461
Tell you what.

1410
01:29:22,502 --> 01:29:25,130
How about I let you lean over me
when we fly over the strip?

1411
01:29:33,639 --> 01:29:35,140
Thank you.

1412
01:29:36,391 --> 01:29:37,559
Hot towel?

1413
01:29:39,978 --> 01:29:41,855
Thanks.

1414
01:29:51,490 --> 01:29:54,243
Oh, my. I'm sorry.

1415
01:29:55,410 --> 01:29:57,538
I've never been
on first class before.

1416
01:29:57,579 --> 01:29:59,957
My name is Joyce.
Just buzz if you need anything.

1417
01:29:59,998 --> 01:30:02,209
Thank you. Here.

1418
01:30:07,089 --> 01:30:08,882
Sir?

1419
01:30:08,924 --> 01:30:10,384
Is that Billy Idol?

1420
01:30:12,135 --> 01:30:14,388
-I believe it is.
-Oh, my God.

1421
01:30:14,429 --> 01:30:17,099
Would you like some champagne
or some orange juice?

1422
01:30:17,140 --> 01:30:18,767
How much is it?

1423
01:30:18,809 --> 01:30:21,895
-It's free.
-It's what?

1424
01:30:21,937 --> 01:30:24,147
Holy shit, this is incredible.

1425
01:30:24,189 --> 01:30:25,440
Actually, I shouldn't drink.

1426
01:30:25,524 --> 01:30:28,652
I fell in love with this girl
who's going to marry an idiot...

1427
01:30:28,694 --> 01:30:30,696
so I'm on my way to Vegas
to stop them.

1428
01:30:30,779 --> 01:30:34,199
That's the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

1429
01:30:34,241 --> 01:30:35,617
Where are they getting married?

1430
01:30:35,701 --> 01:30:36,660
I don't know where...

1431
01:30:36,660 --> 01:30:38,453
but I'm going to run around
and find them.

1432
01:30:38,495 --> 01:30:39,955
I got to do what I got to do.

1433
01:30:50,632 --> 01:30:52,259
Next time they come by,
grab me a Heineken.

1434
01:31:00,475 --> 01:31:02,269
She comes over to tell me
how she feels...

1435
01:31:02,311 --> 01:31:04,313
and Linda answers the door...

1436
01:31:04,313 --> 01:31:06,815
wearing nothing
but my Van Halen t-shirt.

1437
01:31:06,857 --> 01:31:08,442
No way.

1438
01:31:08,483 --> 01:31:09,693
I don't know what to do.

1439
01:31:09,735 --> 01:31:12,237
She's getting married,
and he's going to ruin her life.

1440
01:31:12,279 --> 01:31:14,531
Glenn doesn't deserve her.

1441
01:31:14,573 --> 01:31:16,658
All he cares about
are possessions...

1442
01:31:16,700 --> 01:31:20,662
fancy cars, CD players.

1443
01:31:20,704 --> 01:31:23,165
Even women
are possessions to him.

1444
01:31:23,207 --> 01:31:24,333
Billy idol gets it.

1445
01:31:24,374 --> 01:31:26,251
I don't know why
she doesn't get it.

1446
01:31:26,293 --> 01:31:27,544
I hope you find her.

1447
01:31:27,586 --> 01:31:29,254
You guys
will not believe this.

1448
01:31:29,296 --> 01:31:31,340
Some creep in coach
who thinks he's Don Johnson...

1449
01:31:31,381 --> 01:31:34,134
just asked me to be part
of the mile-high club.

1450
01:31:34,176 --> 01:31:37,763
He said I was
Grade-A, top-choice meat.

1451
01:31:43,852 --> 01:31:45,479
Is he right in here?

1452
01:31:47,523 --> 01:31:49,024
What's the mile-high club?

1453
01:31:59,159 --> 01:32:01,078
Oh, my God.
The mile-high guy is Glenn.

1454
01:32:01,119 --> 01:32:02,579
They're on this plane.

1455
01:32:02,621 --> 01:32:04,289
No way!

1456
01:32:04,331 --> 01:32:05,457
You guys got to help me.

1457
01:32:05,499 --> 01:32:07,167
Right!

1458
01:32:10,420 --> 01:32:12,464
Good afternoon, everyone.

1459
01:32:12,506 --> 01:32:16,260
We're flying at 26,000 feet,
moving up to 30,000 feet...

1460
01:32:16,301 --> 01:32:19,638
and we got clear skies
all the way to Las Vegas.

1461
01:32:19,680 --> 01:32:22,849
And now, we're bringing you
some in-flight entertainment.

1462
01:32:22,891 --> 01:32:24,851
One of our first-class
passengers...

1463
01:32:24,893 --> 01:32:26,311
would like
to sing you a song...

1464
01:32:26,353 --> 01:32:28,313
inspired by one
of our coach passengers.

1465
01:32:28,355 --> 01:32:31,316
And since we let
our first-class passengers...

1466
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:35,028
do pretty much whatever
they want, here he is.

1467
01:32:37,239 --> 01:32:40,617
I wanna make you smile...

1468
01:32:40,659 --> 01:32:43,036
Whenever you're sad...

1469
01:32:43,078 --> 01:32:44,329
Carry you around...

1470
01:32:44,371 --> 01:32:46,915
When your arthritis is bad.

1471
01:32:46,957 --> 01:32:49,668
Oh, all I wanna do...

1472
01:32:49,710 --> 01:32:52,379
Is grow old with you.

1473
01:32:55,382 --> 01:32:57,467
I'll get you medicine...

1474
01:32:57,509 --> 01:33:01,054
When your tummy aches...

1475
01:33:01,096 --> 01:33:02,681
Build you a fire...

1476
01:33:02,723 --> 01:33:04,725
If the furnace breaks.

1477
01:33:04,766 --> 01:33:08,437
Oh, it could be so nice...

1478
01:33:08,437 --> 01:33:11,064
Growin' old with you.

1479
01:33:14,067 --> 01:33:16,153
I'll miss you...

1480
01:33:16,195 --> 01:33:18,447
Kiss you...

1481
01:33:18,488 --> 01:33:20,157
Give you my coat...

1482
01:33:20,199 --> 01:33:22,701
When you are cold...

1483
01:33:22,784 --> 01:33:24,703
Need you...

1484
01:33:24,703 --> 01:33:27,039
Feed you...

1485
01:33:27,080 --> 01:33:28,707
Even let you hold...

1486
01:33:28,749 --> 01:33:30,751
The remote control.

1487
01:33:34,630 --> 01:33:36,632
What the hell's
that fruit doing here?

1488
01:33:41,720 --> 01:33:43,513
Get out of the way!

1489
01:33:43,555 --> 01:33:45,390
Excuse me, sir.
I have to serve the beverages.

1490
01:33:52,814 --> 01:33:55,484
How you doing, sir?
Chicken or fish?

1491
01:33:55,526 --> 01:33:56,985
Get out of my way,
or you're going to get hurt.

1492
01:33:58,195 --> 01:34:00,697
Don't you talk
to Billy Idol that way.

1493
01:34:04,826 --> 01:34:06,787
So let me clear the dishes...

1494
01:34:06,828 --> 01:34:09,873
In our kitchen sink...

1495
01:34:09,915 --> 01:34:11,041
Put you to bed...

1496
01:34:11,083 --> 01:34:13,293
When you've had
too much to drink.

1497
01:34:15,712 --> 01:34:18,257
I could be the man...

1498
01:34:18,298 --> 01:34:22,469
Who grows old with you.

1499
01:34:22,511 --> 01:34:25,013
I wanna grow old...

1500
01:34:25,055 --> 01:34:27,349
With you.

1501
01:34:36,233 --> 01:34:38,861
That was the most
beautiful song.

1502
01:34:38,902 --> 01:34:40,612
I got a confession to make.

1503
01:34:40,654 --> 01:34:43,448
That song was about you.

1504
01:34:43,490 --> 01:34:44,950
Good.

1505
01:34:44,992 --> 01:34:47,286
I'm in love with you.

1506
01:34:48,787 --> 01:34:51,540
I am so in love with you.

1507
01:34:53,584 --> 01:34:55,294
That wasn't a bad song.

1508
01:34:55,377 --> 01:34:57,796
I'm going to tell those
record company guys about you.

1509
01:34:57,838 --> 01:35:00,090
You mind if I give her
a kiss first?

1510
01:35:00,132 --> 01:35:02,175
Do what you got to do.

1511
01:35:22,154 --> 01:35:24,907
I know this...

1512
01:35:24,907 --> 01:35:26,700
Much is...

1513
01:35:26,742 --> 01:35:28,035
True.

1514
01:35:31,788 --> 01:35:34,583
I know this...

1515
01:35:34,625 --> 01:35:36,460
Much is...

1516
01:35:36,501 --> 01:35:38,295
True.

1517
01:35:39,296 --> 01:35:41,173
I know, I know, I know...

1518
01:35:41,173 --> 01:35:43,675
This much is true.

1519
01:35:43,717 --> 01:35:45,969
Oh, yes, I do...

1520
01:35:46,011 --> 01:35:50,140
Robbie and Julia.

1521
01:35:51,000 --> 01:35:54,135
