1<br />
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,667<br />
Ray, where are you going?<br />
<br />
2<br />
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,710<br />
Come back to bed.<br />
<br />
3<br />
00:03:57,446 --> 00:04:00,938<br />
Watch it,<br />
you miserable little...<br />
<br />
4<br />
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,140<br />
Queenie!<br />
<br />
5<br />
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,191<br />
'Morning, Walter!<br />
<br />
6<br />
00:04:39,863 --> 00:04:44,072<br />
Good girl.<br />
Their lawn needed fertilizing anyway.<br />
<br />
7<br />
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:46,968<br />
Good morning, lieutenant.<br />
Mrs. rumsfield.<br />
<br />
8<br />
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,095<br />
Hi, Ricky.<br />
<br />
9<br />
00:05:57,649 --> 00:06:00,561<br />
Oh, Mr. rumsfield, be careful,<br />
queenie...!<br />
<br />
10<br />
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:03,226<br />
Goddam it...<br />
<br />
11<br />
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:07,614<br />
Walter... Walter!<br />
<br />
12<br />
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:11,359<br />
- Walter!<br />
- I love that dude.<br />
<br />
13<br />
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,241<br />
- Walter! Walter!<br />
- Mark!<br />
<br />
14<br />
00:06:16,585 --> 00:06:18,450<br />
What are you doing up?<br />
<br />
15<br />
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:23,164<br />
Walter's dog just took a dump<br />
on rumsfield's lawn again.<br />
<br />
16<br />
00:06:23,842 --> 00:06:25,673<br />
Good, honey.<br />
<br />
17<br />
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,797<br />
- I know you're in there, old man!<br />
- Honey, honey, the neighbors.<br />
<br />
18<br />
00:06:28,889 --> 00:06:30,845<br />
Listen up, mister!<br />
<br />
19<br />
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:36,184<br />
That piece of scum, barking rat of yours<br />
has just taken his last dump on my lawn!<br />
<br />
20<br />
00:06:36,271 --> 00:06:41,857<br />
I find one more... just one... I'm gonna<br />
catch him and staple his ass shut!<br />
<br />
21<br />
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,860<br />
- I'm gonna do it right now.<br />
- No, no, no! Honey, don't.<br />
<br />
22<br />
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:48,279<br />
Come on. Let's go home.<br />
<br />
23<br />
00:06:51,536 --> 00:06:54,494<br />
Hey, honey,<br />
I think we should move.<br />
<br />
24<br />
00:06:55,999 --> 00:06:58,081<br />
This neighborhood...<br />
<br />
25<br />
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,626<br />
We got an arms dealer across the street<br />
and a crazy person down it.<br />
<br />
26<br />
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:05,501<br />
All they ever do is fight.<br />
Is this sweet enough?<br />
<br />
27<br />
00:07:06,384 --> 00:07:10,548<br />
Now there's new next-door neighbors...<br />
What is their name again? The klopeks?<br />
<br />
28<br />
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:14,302<br />
- Is that a slavic name?<br />
- I don't know.<br />
<br />
29<br />
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,928<br />
They've been here a month. Think they're<br />
gonna do something about their yard?<br />
<br />
30<br />
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,732<br />
Are you gonna eat any of this?<br />
<br />
31<br />
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:29,563<br />
Oh, no. I got that thing<br />
with my stomach again.<br />
<br />
32<br />
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:32,657<br />
I wonder what was going on<br />
over there last night.<br />
<br />
33<br />
00:07:32,744 --> 00:07:36,282<br />
- I knew this was gonna happen.<br />
- What?<br />
<br />
34<br />
00:07:36,373 --> 00:07:39,661<br />
- Nothing.<br />
- What, Carol? What did you know is going to happen?<br />
<br />
35<br />
00:07:39,751 --> 00:07:41,912<br />
It's started already.<br />
Look at you.<br />
<br />
36<br />
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,814<br />
You're gonna sit around<br />
all week doing nothing...<br />
<br />
37<br />
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:48,548<br />
Get bored out of your mind and go back<br />
to work in worse shape than you are now.<br />
<br />
38<br />
00:07:49,094 --> 00:07:50,209<br />
No, I'm not.<br />
<br />
39<br />
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:54,672<br />
Please, let's pack up the car and go<br />
to the lake. Just get away and rest.<br />
<br />
40<br />
00:07:54,766 --> 00:07:56,006<br />
You should see yourself.<br />
<br />
41<br />
00:07:56,101 --> 00:07:58,558<br />
You were up at the crack of dawn<br />
watching a dog poop.<br />
<br />
42<br />
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:01,102<br />
You call going up<br />
to the lake resting?<br />
<br />
43<br />
00:08:01,189 --> 00:08:04,226<br />
It is four hours of driving on the tollway<br />
in holiday traffic...<br />
<br />
44<br />
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:09,061<br />
To sit in some dank, wet cabin and wait<br />
for that neighbor with the enormous head...<br />
<br />
45<br />
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,612<br />
- To get drunk and fall down.<br />
- He's a hydrocephalic.<br />
<br />
46<br />
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:15,693<br />
- I don't think that you should make fun...<br />
- Honey, that's not my idea of restful.<br />
<br />
47<br />
00:08:15,787 --> 00:08:19,325<br />
This is restful:<br />
Hanging around the house, just being lazy.<br />
<br />
48<br />
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:22,499<br />
That's what I want to do.<br />
I just wanna... hang around.<br />
<br />
49<br />
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:26,498<br />
Be lazy, listen to the ball game<br />
and drink a couple hundred beers...<br />
<br />
50<br />
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,797<br />
Ahd maybe smoke an occasional cigar...<br />
Outside.<br />
<br />
51<br />
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,967<br />
I'll fix the barbecue in the backyard.<br />
I'll do that.<br />
<br />
52<br />
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:37,047<br />
This is what I need, Carol.<br />
I need... this.<br />
<br />
53<br />
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:40,885<br />
You'll see, at the end of the week,<br />
I'll be a brand new human being.<br />
<br />
54<br />
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,265<br />
It's your vacation.<br />
<br />
55<br />
00:09:11,009 --> 00:09:12,715<br />
Quiet!<br />
<br />
56<br />
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,892<br />
Art's got a gun!<br />
<br />
57<br />
00:09:29,778 --> 00:09:31,234<br />
Art!<br />
<br />
58<br />
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:35,359<br />
Hey, hi, ray.<br />
Hey, are you guys eatin' in there?<br />
<br />
59<br />
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,442<br />
You know how suzette<br />
is about her bird feeder.<br />
<br />
60<br />
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:40,697<br />
These crows start showing up<br />
out of nowhere.<br />
<br />
61<br />
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:42,389<br />
She's all over my back<br />
to get rid of 'em.<br />
<br />
62<br />
00:09:42,457 --> 00:09:44,914<br />
"Oh, the crows are too big<br />
for the bird feeder," she says.<br />
<br />
63<br />
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:46,854<br />
I don't remember seeing crows<br />
around here before.<br />
<br />
64<br />
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:49,961<br />
Big bastards, too. That's why I<br />
got the gun. I'm gonna pop a few.<br />
<br />
65<br />
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:57,503<br />
Hey, I'm eating here. Can you imagine me<br />
and the two of them alone for a week?<br />
<br />
66<br />
00:09:57,597 --> 00:09:59,679<br />
I'd rather chew broken glass.<br />
<br />
67<br />
00:09:59,766 --> 00:10:04,226<br />
Uh-uh, this is gonna be a big week<br />
for the bachelor kid.<br />
<br />
68<br />
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,146<br />
Vince.<br />
<br />
69<br />
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,850<br />
Vince.<br />
<br />
70<br />
00:10:09,442 --> 00:10:11,683<br />
How come<br />
you're not at work, ray?<br />
<br />
71<br />
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:14,736<br />
- I took the week off.<br />
- A week off?<br />
<br />
72<br />
00:10:14,823 --> 00:10:16,926<br />
That's great. Are you guys<br />
going to the lake or something?<br />
<br />
73<br />
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:19,191<br />
- No, the backyard.<br />
- Backyard?<br />
<br />
74<br />
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:21,571<br />
I just want to hang<br />
around the house and relax.<br />
<br />
75<br />
00:10:21,663 --> 00:10:25,622<br />
Relax? Good luck with those maniacs<br />
you got living next door.<br />
<br />
76<br />
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,415<br />
- Have you met the klopeks yet?<br />
- No.<br />
<br />
77<br />
00:10:28,503 --> 00:10:31,210<br />
No, I haven't.<br />
Nobody on the block has.<br />
<br />
78<br />
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,791<br />
But I did talk to the real estate broad<br />
that sold them the place.<br />
<br />
79<br />
00:10:35,885 --> 00:10:39,548<br />
Apparently, their last house...<br />
It only burnt to the ground.<br />
<br />
80<br />
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,130<br />
- Really?<br />
- Yep.<br />
<br />
81<br />
00:10:42,225 --> 00:10:45,513<br />
A hideous, raging inferno.<br />
<br />
82<br />
00:10:48,064 --> 00:10:50,020<br />
Neighbors from hell.<br />
<br />
83<br />
00:10:52,986 --> 00:10:54,146<br />
Maybe.<br />
<br />
84<br />
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:58,025<br />
Whatever it is, I'm sure glad<br />
I'm not the one who lives right next door.<br />
<br />
85<br />
00:10:58,116 --> 00:11:02,906<br />
Come on, let's face it,<br />
these klopeks are strange.<br />
<br />
86<br />
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,099<br />
I've been watching that house<br />
ever since they moved in.<br />
<br />
87<br />
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:07,956<br />
No one goes in.<br />
No one comes out.<br />
<br />
88<br />
00:11:08,042 --> 00:11:10,454<br />
No visitors. No deliveries.<br />
<br />
89<br />
00:11:10,545 --> 00:11:13,537<br />
What do you think<br />
they're eatin' over there, ray?<br />
<br />
90<br />
00:11:14,382 --> 00:11:17,545<br />
Well, maybe these people<br />
just want to keep to themselves, art.<br />
<br />
91<br />
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,421<br />
Remember when the knapps<br />
lived next door?<br />
<br />
92<br />
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,299<br />
How many conversations<br />
did you have with the knapps? I had two.<br />
<br />
93<br />
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,118<br />
- Oh, come on.<br />
- They didn't even say goodbye when they moved.<br />
<br />
94<br />
00:11:24,142 --> 00:11:26,679<br />
Oh, please.<br />
Don't even compare the two.<br />
<br />
95<br />
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:29,511<br />
I mean, come on.<br />
At least, if they weren't conversational...<br />
<br />
96<br />
00:11:29,606 --> 00:11:31,750<br />
The knapps were semi-normal.<br />
They worked in their yard.<br />
<br />
97<br />
00:11:31,774 --> 00:11:33,981<br />
They mowed their lawn.<br />
They had a lawn to mow.<br />
<br />
98<br />
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:38,858<br />
These klopeks... we don't even know<br />
how many of them there are.<br />
<br />
99<br />
00:11:38,948 --> 00:11:40,779<br />
There are three of them.<br />
<br />
100<br />
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:43,609<br />
They only come out at night.<br />
<br />
101<br />
00:11:44,162 --> 00:11:48,656<br />
- Ricky Butler says they're nocturnal feeders.<br />
- Oh, Ricky Butler says.<br />
<br />
102<br />
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:51,537<br />
Last week when I was up on the roof<br />
with my telescope...<br />
<br />
103<br />
00:11:51,628 --> 00:11:53,835<br />
I saw them in their backyard.<br />
<br />
104<br />
00:11:53,922 --> 00:11:57,585<br />
- What were they doing, honey?<br />
- Digging.<br />
<br />
105<br />
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:02,969<br />
- Kind of like grave diggers?<br />
- Maybe.<br />
<br />
106<br />
00:12:03,056 --> 00:12:06,014<br />
All right, that's enough<br />
of this conversation.<br />
<br />
107<br />
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,934<br />
I want you to stop spying on the klopeks<br />
with Ricky Butler.<br />
<br />
108<br />
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:14,230<br />
And I'd like you to stop filling his head<br />
with such half-cocked theories.<br />
<br />
109<br />
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:18,060<br />
- Where you goin'?<br />
- I'm gonna change into my vacation togs.<br />
<br />
110<br />
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:20,645<br />
Are you done with your eggs?<br />
<br />
111<br />
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:27,619<br />
Okay, honey, I'm gonna mix the zinnias in<br />
with the rest of the flowers.<br />
<br />
112<br />
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:31,994<br />
- The man at the nursery said...<br />
- Boy, that really burns my ass.<br />
<br />
113<br />
00:12:32,085 --> 00:12:35,418<br />
- What?<br />
- That old fart.<br />
<br />
114<br />
00:12:35,505 --> 00:12:38,372<br />
He's got the best lawn<br />
on the block.<br />
<br />
115<br />
00:12:40,051 --> 00:12:42,087<br />
And you know why?<br />
<br />
116<br />
00:12:44,305 --> 00:12:48,765<br />
Because he trains his dog<br />
to crap in my yard.<br />
<br />
117<br />
00:12:51,521 --> 00:12:54,433<br />
Hey, Mrs. rumsfield.<br />
<br />
118<br />
00:12:55,149 --> 00:12:57,105<br />
No tan lines this morning.<br />
<br />
119<br />
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,272<br />
Looks nice.<br />
<br />
120<br />
00:13:02,448 --> 00:13:04,530<br />
That kid next door<br />
is a meatball.<br />
<br />
121<br />
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,863<br />
Peterson.<br />
<br />
122<br />
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:16,167<br />
He came out in his robe last night when the<br />
foreigners were making all that racket.<br />
<br />
123<br />
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:18,210<br />
He didn't do one thing.<br />
<br />
124<br />
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:23,048<br />
So, what are you gonna do first?<br />
<br />
125<br />
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:25,047<br />
I don't know.<br />
<br />
126<br />
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:27,799<br />
- Hey, did I show you my new tools?<br />
- No.<br />
<br />
127<br />
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:30,131<br />
These are great.<br />
<br />
128<br />
00:13:30,226 --> 00:13:33,593<br />
Carol's father gave them to me<br />
for Christmas.<br />
<br />
129<br />
00:13:36,274 --> 00:13:37,764<br />
Look.<br />
<br />
130<br />
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:39,931<br />
- Oh, those are beauties.<br />
- Yeah.<br />
<br />
131<br />
00:13:39,986 --> 00:13:43,353<br />
- You gonna build something with those?<br />
- It think so.<br />
<br />
132<br />
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:45,029<br />
Probably.<br />
<br />
133<br />
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:50,447<br />
- Hey, what time does the ball game go on?<br />
- It think it's at about 1:00.<br />
<br />
134<br />
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:53,405<br />
You want to go down to the deli<br />
and get one of those beef sandwiches?<br />
<br />
135<br />
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:57,492<br />
No. I'm thinking of getting one of<br />
those electric garage door openers...<br />
<br />
136<br />
00:13:57,587 --> 00:13:59,578<br />
And installing it.<br />
<br />
137<br />
00:14:07,472 --> 00:14:09,884<br />
Ray. Ray!<br />
<br />
138<br />
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:11,965<br />
Ray, come here!<br />
<br />
139<br />
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,723<br />
What is it?<br />
<br />
140<br />
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:24,811<br />
It's my neighbor.<br />
<br />
141<br />
00:14:26,908 --> 00:14:31,197<br />
Hey, one of the huns<br />
came out of the cave.<br />
<br />
142<br />
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:08,396<br />
Why don't you go say hi?<br />
<br />
143<br />
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:14,528<br />
- Well, yeah, I guess I could.<br />
- You know, this would be the perfect time...<br />
<br />
144<br />
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,661<br />
Because if you go talk to him,<br />
we could see what he's like. Go.<br />
<br />
145<br />
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,163<br />
You could go<br />
say hi to him too, you know?<br />
<br />
146<br />
00:15:21,254 --> 00:15:23,607<br />
- Yeah, but he's your neighbor.<br />
- Well, he's your neighbor as well.<br />
<br />
147<br />
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,997<br />
But I'm over.<br />
You share a property line with him.<br />
<br />
148<br />
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,583<br />
We're all on the same block,<br />
so you could go too.<br />
<br />
149<br />
00:15:28,678 --> 00:15:31,715<br />
We're all in the same town too,<br />
but you're right next to him.<br />
<br />
150<br />
00:15:31,806 --> 00:15:34,118<br />
If he was ever gonna borrow anything,<br />
he'd come over to your place.<br />
<br />
151<br />
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:37,179<br />
- Well, he's busy now.<br />
- He's not busy.<br />
<br />
152<br />
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,352<br />
Now look, he's goin' in.<br />
Go now because if...<br />
<br />
153<br />
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,681<br />
He's going back in.<br />
If you were gonna say hi...<br />
<br />
154<br />
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,962<br />
You should probably...<br />
There, he's going into the house.<br />
<br />
155<br />
00:15:44,986 --> 00:15:48,604<br />
You're gonna lose him<br />
because he's gonna go in...<br />
<br />
156<br />
00:15:49,157 --> 00:15:51,635<br />
- Well, now you've blown it, haven't you?<br />
- No, I didn't blow it.<br />
<br />
157<br />
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:53,262<br />
- Chicken. Chicken.<br />
- He went into his house.<br />
<br />
158<br />
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:55,402<br />
I'm not a chicken<br />
because he went into his house.<br />
<br />
159<br />
00:15:55,496 --> 00:16:00,456<br />
You know, you look like a chicken in front<br />
of your son and everything. Your son.<br />
<br />
160<br />
00:16:00,543 --> 00:16:01,543<br />
Come on, come on.<br />
<br />
161<br />
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:05,329<br />
- If it's suddenly a big deal, let's just go say hello.<br />
- Hey, hey, it's a joke!<br />
<br />
162<br />
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:07,288<br />
- Let's say hello.<br />
- Why so edgy?<br />
<br />
163<br />
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,123<br />
- Come on, come on.<br />
- Try decaf.<br />
<br />
164<br />
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,255<br />
They're daring each other<br />
to ring the doorbell.<br />
<br />
165<br />
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:14,052<br />
We shouldn't stare like this.<br />
<br />
166<br />
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:17,758<br />
If it's such a big deal, why don't we both<br />
go say hello, or are you chicken?<br />
<br />
167<br />
00:16:17,852 --> 00:16:20,218<br />
Go for it, Mr. Peterson! Yes!<br />
<br />
168<br />
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:24,476<br />
Now everybody's watching us.<br />
<br />
169<br />
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:26,478<br />
- Good going, man!<br />
- Yeah, okay, yeah.<br />
<br />
170<br />
00:16:26,569 --> 00:16:30,232<br />
Yeah, I'll go in with you.<br />
Sure. Right. No problem.<br />
<br />
171<br />
00:16:30,323 --> 00:16:32,154<br />
Let's go.<br />
<br />
172<br />
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:09,809<br />
I don't know if you noticed,<br />
but there's bars on the basement windows.<br />
<br />
173<br />
00:17:11,781 --> 00:17:14,272<br />
- They got holes in their porch too.<br />
- That was a booby trap.<br />
<br />
174<br />
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,823<br />
- You okay? "Booby trap"...<br />
- Yeah.<br />
<br />
175<br />
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:19,698<br />
- I'm not gonna pay for that.<br />
- We shouldn't pay for that, we should sue them.<br />
<br />
176<br />
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:24,374<br />
Well, um, let's...<br />
Let's say hello.<br />
<br />
177<br />
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:44,177<br />
Hey...<br />
<br />
178<br />
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:51,313<br />
Get the hose. Hang on, men!<br />
<br />
179<br />
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:58,988<br />
Run to Mel! Run to water!<br />
<br />
180<br />
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,499<br />
This way! Over here!<br />
Run to water!<br />
<br />
181<br />
00:18:06,586 --> 00:18:08,577<br />
Run to me! Come on!<br />
<br />
182<br />
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:14,748<br />
Come on! Come on!<br />
<br />
183<br />
00:18:28,858 --> 00:18:32,396<br />
I think they're gone, Mark.<br />
I think they're gone!<br />
<br />
184<br />
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:35,353<br />
- You men hit?<br />
- I cannot believe you did that.<br />
<br />
185<br />
00:18:35,448 --> 00:18:37,608<br />
- I cannot believe it! That was great.<br />
- Neither can I.<br />
<br />
186<br />
00:18:37,658 --> 00:18:40,274<br />
The same thing happened to me last week.<br />
I was over there.<br />
<br />
187<br />
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,611<br />
It wasn't bees, though.<br />
It was a foaming squirrel.<br />
<br />
188<br />
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:51,203<br />
In southeast Asia,<br />
we'd call this type of thing "bad Karma."<br />
<br />
189<br />
00:19:15,321 --> 00:19:18,438<br />
Honey, bee stings don't heal<br />
if you keep playing with them.<br />
<br />
190<br />
00:19:18,532 --> 00:19:21,899<br />
If we had gone to the lake,<br />
I'd have twice as many of these by now.<br />
<br />
191<br />
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:26,533<br />
- It isn't like anything you said is coming true.<br />
- Where are you going?<br />
<br />
192<br />
00:19:26,624 --> 00:19:28,706<br />
I can't walk away<br />
without you asking where I'm going?<br />
<br />
193<br />
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:32,206<br />
I'm going to Paris, France, okay?<br />
I'm going to banff, Canada, all right?<br />
<br />
194<br />
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:34,457<br />
- That's where I'm going.<br />
- Are you taking the dog?<br />
<br />
195<br />
00:19:34,548 --> 00:19:37,585<br />
Yeah, yeah.<br />
I'm taking the dog for a walk.<br />
<br />
196<br />
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:49,385<br />
No, wait, wait, wait.<br />
<br />
197<br />
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,019<br />
Hey, Vince, let's go over here, huh?<br />
Let's not go that way tonight.<br />
<br />
198<br />
00:19:55,236 --> 00:19:57,978<br />
Here. Here's a nice yard.<br />
It's a good yard.<br />
<br />
199<br />
00:19:58,072 --> 00:19:59,983<br />
Hey, you with the dog!<br />
<br />
200<br />
00:20:01,701 --> 00:20:04,818<br />
Hey, keep that mutt<br />
off my lawn, will ya?<br />
<br />
201<br />
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:07,324<br />
All right. Have a field day.<br />
<br />
202<br />
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:12,396<br />
He comes over here to smoke cigars. His wife<br />
won't let him. He doesn't know I know that.<br />
<br />
203<br />
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,752<br />
Hi, ray. How ya doin', bud?<br />
<br />
204<br />
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:18,081<br />
- Hey, there, Mr. Peterson.<br />
- How are you? Good to see you.<br />
<br />
205<br />
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:20,587<br />
- Wouldn't need a lighter, would you?<br />
- Thanks.<br />
<br />
206<br />
00:20:20,678 --> 00:20:25,172<br />
- It is a lovely night, isn't it?<br />
- Yeah, green sky tonight.<br />
<br />
207<br />
00:20:26,851 --> 00:20:31,641<br />
Green sky at morning:<br />
Neighbor take warning.<br />
<br />
208<br />
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:37,191<br />
Green sky at night?<br />
<br />
209<br />
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,399<br />
Neighbor take flight.<br />
<br />
210<br />
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:47,235<br />
You know, did you ever see the movie<br />
the sentinel, Mr. Peterson?<br />
<br />
211<br />
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:52,198<br />
It's about the old guy who owns the apartment<br />
which is kind of like the gateway to hell.<br />
<br />
212<br />
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,622<br />
No, I didn't see that.<br />
<br />
213<br />
00:20:55,713 --> 00:21:00,207<br />
Oh, well,<br />
I was doing some thinking.<br />
<br />
214<br />
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:05,469<br />
And, you know, being that their last house<br />
burned down and all...<br />
<br />
215<br />
00:21:05,556 --> 00:21:10,220<br />
It's like, maybe,<br />
somebody left the gate open.<br />
<br />
216<br />
00:21:12,146 --> 00:21:16,560<br />
It's them.<br />
They're movin' around again.<br />
<br />
217<br />
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:21,898<br />
You know, it was a night just like this<br />
that it happened.<br />
<br />
218<br />
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,604<br />
What happened, Mr. weingartner?<br />
<br />
219<br />
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:27,191<br />
It was a long time ago, Ricky.<br />
Hinkley hills was a lot smaller then.<br />
<br />
220<br />
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:32,656<br />
Safer too. You never had to lock your<br />
doors. Everybody knew everybody.<br />
<br />
221<br />
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:35,913<br />
I must have been maybe<br />
nine, ten years old.<br />
<br />
222<br />
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,995<br />
- You know where the big mall is?<br />
- Yeah.<br />
<br />
223<br />
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,171<br />
There used to be a big drugstore<br />
on the corner there.<br />
<br />
224<br />
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:44,295<br />
- It had a big soda fountain. Remember that?<br />
- Yeah.<br />
<br />
225<br />
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:47,469<br />
The guy who ran it was a rotund guy,<br />
had glasses.<br />
<br />
226<br />
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,138<br />
His name was skip.<br />
Lived over on elm.<br />
<br />
227<br />
00:21:50,226 --> 00:21:53,844<br />
Had a wife, a couple kids.<br />
Not too sharp. I mean, hey...<br />
<br />
228<br />
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:57,305<br />
The guy's 40 years old, he's wearing<br />
a paper hat and making cherry cokes.<br />
<br />
229<br />
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,936<br />
It's a cinch he's not running<br />
for governor, right?<br />
<br />
230<br />
00:22:00,027 --> 00:22:02,268<br />
Anyway, it got hot that summer.<br />
<br />
231<br />
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:04,274<br />
It got real hot.<br />
It was sweltering.<br />
<br />
232<br />
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,402<br />
That heat where your underwear sweats<br />
and it crawls up the...<br />
<br />
233<br />
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:09,199<br />
Anyway, it's hot, okay?<br />
<br />
234<br />
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:13,950<br />
And they start smelling<br />
this really vile stench over on elm...<br />
<br />
235<br />
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,657<br />
And they figure it's comin'<br />
from skip's place.<br />
<br />
236<br />
00:22:16,752 --> 00:22:18,647<br />
No one wants to say anything.<br />
I mean, what do you do?<br />
<br />
237<br />
00:22:18,671 --> 00:22:21,208<br />
Go knock on the guy's door,<br />
"hi, your house stinks"?<br />
<br />
238<br />
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,755<br />
So people are trying<br />
to ignore it, right?<br />
<br />
239<br />
00:22:23,843 --> 00:22:27,335<br />
They're trying to pretend it isn't<br />
happening. You know those pine things?<br />
<br />
240<br />
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:29,699<br />
They're trying to cover up with those<br />
pine things that you can put in cars.<br />
<br />
241<br />
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:33,432<br />
People are hanging those<br />
on their porches.<br />
<br />
242<br />
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:38,179<br />
- Oh, you think that's funny, Ricky?<br />
- Well, yeah.<br />
<br />
243<br />
00:22:38,274 --> 00:22:40,731<br />
Oh, yeah?<br />
Let me tell you what happened next.<br />
<br />
244<br />
00:22:40,818 --> 00:22:44,185<br />
The state health inspector shows up.<br />
They go over. They talk to skip.<br />
<br />
245<br />
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:46,316<br />
He says he's got a sump pump problem.<br />
They leave.<br />
<br />
246<br />
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,593<br />
Hey, the guy's got a sewer problem.<br />
He says he'll look after it.<br />
<br />
247<br />
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:50,278<br />
- Everything's okay, right?<br />
- Yeah.<br />
<br />
248<br />
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:52,200<br />
Wrong. A couple hours later...<br />
<br />
249<br />
00:22:52,288 --> 00:22:54,349<br />
There's smoke pouring out<br />
of the windows of skip's house.<br />
<br />
250<br />
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,035<br />
- The firemen go in. Know what they find?<br />
- What?<br />
<br />
251<br />
00:22:57,126 --> 00:22:59,458<br />
Skip's family, dead. Murdered...<br />
<br />
252<br />
00:22:59,545 --> 00:23:03,208<br />
By skip... weeks earlier...<br />
With an ice pick.<br />
<br />
253<br />
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,382<br />
Yeah, the guy killed<br />
his whole family...<br />
<br />
254<br />
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:10,002<br />
With an ice pick.<br />
<br />
255<br />
00:23:11,557 --> 00:23:14,469<br />
Yeah. Yeah, just put 'em<br />
in the cool basement...<br />
<br />
256<br />
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:19,304<br />
Covered 'em up with a sheet and went back to<br />
makin' ice cream treats for the townsfolk.<br />
<br />
257<br />
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:24,233<br />
Only skip didn't count on there being<br />
a big heat wave that summer.<br />
<br />
258<br />
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:27,938<br />
You know what all those people<br />
were smelling on elm, Ricky?<br />
<br />
259<br />
00:23:28,032 --> 00:23:29,943<br />
What?<br />
<br />
260<br />
00:23:30,034 --> 00:23:35,870<br />
Skip's family's bodies,<br />
decomposing in the summer heat.<br />
<br />
261<br />
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:40,290<br />
Yeah, apparently, one day skip made<br />
just one-too-many lemon phosphates.<br />
<br />
262<br />
00:23:40,377 --> 00:23:42,163<br />
El snappo.<br />
<br />
263<br />
00:23:43,172 --> 00:23:48,587<br />
I remember that. I remember<br />
hearing about that when I was a kid.<br />
<br />
264<br />
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,636<br />
They... they tore down<br />
the soda fountain that fall.<br />
<br />
265<br />
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:57,012<br />
These towns are full of those stories. Sometimes<br />
they're happening right under your nose.<br />
<br />
266<br />
00:23:57,102 --> 00:23:58,808<br />
You know, speaking of noses...<br />
<br />
267<br />
00:23:58,896 --> 00:24:01,638<br />
Ever since this family<br />
has moved to this block...<br />
<br />
268<br />
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:05,475<br />
I've been noticing<br />
a weird kind of odour.<br />
<br />
269<br />
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:08,026<br />
Kind of like death.<br />
<br />
270<br />
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:15,739<br />
Oh, jump a little higher,<br />
spud webb.<br />
<br />
271<br />
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:18,241<br />
- Oh, slam dunk!<br />
- Sorry, Mr. Peterson, it was a mistake.<br />
<br />
272<br />
00:24:18,332 --> 00:24:20,352<br />
- I didn't mean... well, it wasn't a mistake.<br />
- Don't apologize.<br />
<br />
273<br />
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,662<br />
- I'm goin' home.<br />
- Oh, come on.<br />
<br />
274<br />
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:26,337<br />
- Don't be a weenie. It was a joke!<br />
- I'm sorry, Mr. Peterson.<br />
<br />
275<br />
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:30,792<br />
I'm gonna go do something productive.<br />
I'm gonna go watch television.<br />
<br />
276<br />
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:34,970<br />
The answer is: It's the next federal<br />
holiday after Washington's birthday.<br />
<br />
277<br />
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,618<br />
- What is Lincoln's birthday?<br />
- What is Memorial Day?<br />
<br />
278<br />
00:24:36,642 --> 00:24:37,973<br />
Memorial Day is it. Select.<br />
<br />
279<br />
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,288<br />
- They combined Lincoln's birthday with Washington's.<br />
- It's always flip-flopping.<br />
<br />
280<br />
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,223<br />
- It's one weekend now.<br />
- "Remain calm...<br />
<br />
281<br />
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:44,542<br />
Float with arms stretched out<br />
at right angles to the body..."<br />
<br />
282<br />
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,524<br />
That's what you used to say to me<br />
in college, honey, right?<br />
<br />
283<br />
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:53,151<br />
- So what about your parents?<br />
- They're not gonna be home 'til Thursday.<br />
<br />
284<br />
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,411<br />
Gail, I swear to god,<br />
this is better than anything on television.<br />
<br />
285<br />
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:02,365<br />
- Why can't we go to a movie?<br />
- A movie?<br />
<br />
286<br />
00:25:02,459 --> 00:25:04,996<br />
That's not real.<br />
It's the same as television.<br />
<br />
287<br />
00:25:05,087 --> 00:25:07,669<br />
Trust me. This is real.<br />
<br />
288<br />
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:10,122<br />
This is my neighborhood.<br />
<br />
289<br />
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:15,465<br />
Here he comes,<br />
right on schedule.<br />
<br />
290<br />
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:20,137<br />
God, I love this street.<br />
<br />
291<br />
00:25:32,156 --> 00:25:33,316<br />
Ray!<br />
<br />
292<br />
00:25:33,407 --> 00:25:35,363<br />
- What?<br />
- Who was Mussolini?<br />
<br />
293<br />
00:25:35,451 --> 00:25:37,908<br />
- "How sweet it is" was, uh...<br />
- Right again.<br />
<br />
294<br />
00:25:37,995 --> 00:25:39,610<br />
Business and industry for 200.<br />
<br />
295<br />
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,991<br />
In the McDonald's<br />
corporate think tank...<br />
<br />
296<br />
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,619<br />
- Art, we're watching the show.<br />
- What does he want?<br />
<br />
297<br />
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,075<br />
I don't know.<br />
<br />
298<br />
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:51,039<br />
- But I'll be back in time for final jeopardy.<br />
- Nebraskans for 1,000, please.<br />
<br />
299<br />
00:25:51,759 --> 00:25:55,752<br />
Okay, okay, the show's started.<br />
Check it out.<br />
<br />
300<br />
00:25:55,846 --> 00:25:59,384<br />
You see the guy with the curly hair?<br />
That's Mr. Peterson.<br />
<br />
301<br />
00:25:59,475 --> 00:26:03,013<br />
He's like this sceptic.<br />
He's basically grounded in reality...<br />
<br />
302<br />
00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:06,124<br />
And he doesn't want to believe his<br />
neighbors are up to something strange...<br />
<br />
303<br />
00:26:06,148 --> 00:26:08,855<br />
'Cause if they were,<br />
he'd have to deal with it, right?<br />
<br />
304<br />
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:12,560<br />
Okay, now see the fat guy?<br />
That's Mr. weingartner.<br />
<br />
305<br />
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:14,895<br />
He thinks the klopeks<br />
are really evil...<br />
<br />
306<br />
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:17,481<br />
And that they're building<br />
a dungeon in their basement.<br />
<br />
307<br />
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:21,785<br />
So he and Mr. rumsfield decided<br />
to do a little snooping around tonight.<br />
<br />
308<br />
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,578<br />
This should be good.<br />
<br />
309<br />
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,125<br />
- What is this?<br />
- It's an infrared scope.<br />
<br />
310<br />
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:39,883<br />
- Snipers use it for night vision.<br />
- What are we gonna do with it?<br />
<br />
311<br />
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,827<br />
I'm gonna crawl over there and get a look<br />
in those barred-up basement windows.<br />
<br />
312<br />
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:44,591<br />
Come here.<br />
<br />
313<br />
00:26:47,481 --> 00:26:50,585<br />
Guys, I've been thinking about it. I don't<br />
think we should go through with this.<br />
<br />
314<br />
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:52,941<br />
What are you?<br />
Are you a 'fraidy cat?<br />
<br />
315<br />
00:26:53,028 --> 00:26:55,235<br />
No, I just think things<br />
have gone off the deep end.<br />
<br />
316<br />
00:26:55,322 --> 00:26:59,656<br />
I mean, infrared night vision scopes? What<br />
are we gonna do next, tap their phone line?<br />
<br />
317<br />
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,404<br />
Oh, that can be arranged.<br />
<br />
318<br />
00:27:01,495 --> 00:27:05,955<br />
Then all we have to do<br />
is burn a cross on their front lawn.<br />
<br />
319<br />
00:27:06,041 --> 00:27:08,828<br />
- Quiet.<br />
- You hear that?<br />
<br />
320<br />
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:10,705<br />
No, that was just me.<br />
<br />
321<br />
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,503<br />
- It's a low-frequency hum or something.<br />
- It's getting louder.<br />
<br />
322<br />
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,251<br />
Listen.<br />
<br />
323<br />
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:19,293<br />
Is that a transformer<br />
or something?<br />
<br />
324<br />
00:27:19,388 --> 00:27:24,928<br />
- The goddamn power company.<br />
- But I can't... where is it coming from?<br />
<br />
325<br />
00:27:27,229 --> 00:27:29,686<br />
I know where it's coming from.<br />
<br />
326<br />
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:01,964<br />
Wow!<br />
<br />
327<br />
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,923<br />
- What the hell was that?<br />
- Brownout.<br />
<br />
328<br />
00:28:06,018 --> 00:28:08,760<br />
Smells like they're cooking<br />
a goddamn cat over there.<br />
<br />
329<br />
00:28:08,854 --> 00:28:12,938<br />
- I'm gonna go find out what exactly...<br />
- Down! Get down, get down!<br />
<br />
330<br />
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,955<br />
No headlights...<br />
<br />
331<br />
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:15,515<br />
I can see the news report now:<br />
<br />
332<br />
00:30:15,605 --> 00:30:19,063<br />
"They were a quiet family.<br />
Kept pretty much to themselves.<br />
<br />
333<br />
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:22,939<br />
No one would have ever<br />
suspected them of foul play."<br />
<br />
334<br />
00:30:31,872 --> 00:30:36,491<br />
And then bang the hell out of it<br />
with a stick. I've never seen that.<br />
<br />
335<br />
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:45,916<br />
I say we get a look<br />
in those garbage cans.<br />
<br />
336<br />
00:30:46,011 --> 00:30:49,924<br />
Call me overly cautious, but don't<br />
you think that's a bit suspicious?<br />
<br />
337<br />
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:53,619<br />
The three of us going through their garbage at 11<br />
o'clock at night in the middle of a rainstorm?<br />
<br />
338<br />
00:30:53,643 --> 00:30:56,806<br />
Affirmative.<br />
That garbage is going nowhere.<br />
<br />
339<br />
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:59,764<br />
I say we wait 'til first light.<br />
Scope me.<br />
<br />
340<br />
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,849<br />
I'm outta here.<br />
<br />
341<br />
00:31:06,031 --> 00:31:08,647<br />
Rain delay. Bummer.<br />
<br />
342<br />
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:24,004<br />
Ray, what was that you were saying<br />
the other day about half-cocked theories?<br />
<br />
343<br />
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:28,676<br />
I think that's the term you used.<br />
Ray... sleep tight.<br />
<br />
344<br />
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,119<br />
No way Wednesday night.<br />
I'm in a league.<br />
<br />
345<br />
00:32:38,206 --> 00:32:42,370<br />
This seminar could change your life, Vic.<br />
The man is a great healer.<br />
<br />
346<br />
00:32:42,461 --> 00:32:45,498<br />
And I'm a great bowler. Wednesday night<br />
we're taking on roselli plumbing.<br />
<br />
347<br />
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:51,084<br />
You should expose yourself to this guy,<br />
Vic. He understands paraphysical forces...<br />
<br />
348<br />
00:32:51,178 --> 00:32:56,093<br />
The healing capabilities of crystals<br />
and the laying on of hands.<br />
<br />
349<br />
00:32:56,183 --> 00:33:01,223<br />
- You wanna try laying on some hands?<br />
- Wait! Hold it, garbies! Garbies!<br />
<br />
350<br />
00:33:01,313 --> 00:33:04,396<br />
Garbagemen! Hold on a minute!<br />
Wait a sec!<br />
<br />
351<br />
00:33:04,483 --> 00:33:07,065<br />
Wait! Wait! Wait! Hold it!<br />
<br />
352<br />
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:09,272<br />
- Hold it! What are you doin"?<br />
- I'm emptying garbage.<br />
<br />
353<br />
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:13,150<br />
Into the garbage truck?<br />
Are you outta your mind? Give me that!<br />
<br />
354<br />
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:16,699<br />
- Hey, cut that out!<br />
- There's nothing here.<br />
<br />
355<br />
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:19,744<br />
Not a finger, not a nose,<br />
nothing!<br />
<br />
356<br />
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,446<br />
- Give me that.<br />
- Here you go.<br />
<br />
357<br />
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:24,908<br />
- What are you doin"?<br />
- You asked me to help.<br />
<br />
358<br />
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:27,164<br />
Who you calling?<br />
<br />
359<br />
00:33:27,255 --> 00:33:29,400<br />
I'm calling the delvaneys<br />
and having them open the cottage.<br />
<br />
360<br />
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:32,131<br />
No, Carol.<br />
I don't want to go to the cottage.<br />
<br />
361<br />
00:33:32,219 --> 00:33:34,961<br />
Fine. Then Dave and I will go<br />
and you can stay here and spy.<br />
<br />
362<br />
00:33:35,055 --> 00:33:38,263<br />
- Oh, alright! Okay!<br />
- What? What? Are you sulking now?<br />
<br />
363<br />
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:40,510<br />
- No, go up to the cottage!<br />
- Is that what's happening?<br />
<br />
364<br />
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:42,747<br />
Take Dave and go to the cottage.<br />
Leave me to pad around the house.<br />
<br />
365<br />
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:44,874<br />
"Pad around the house"? All you do<br />
is pal around the neighborhood...<br />
<br />
366<br />
00:33:44,898 --> 00:33:47,139<br />
- That's my vacation!<br />
- With those two chuckleheads!<br />
<br />
367<br />
00:33:47,234 --> 00:33:49,395<br />
- You know, I am very, very worried about you.<br />
- Why?<br />
<br />
368<br />
00:33:49,486 --> 00:33:52,273<br />
- You're acting like...<br />
- What am I acting like, Carol?<br />
<br />
369<br />
00:33:52,364 --> 00:33:54,133<br />
- I'm acting like a guy who's on vacation!<br />
- Like this!<br />
<br />
370<br />
00:33:54,157 --> 00:33:55,885<br />
- This is not someone on vacation!<br />
- See? I sleep late!<br />
<br />
371<br />
00:33:55,909 --> 00:33:57,570<br />
- Get a tan then!<br />
- Oh, get a tan!<br />
<br />
372<br />
00:33:57,661 --> 00:34:00,323<br />
- How? In my pyjamas?<br />
- Fix the barbecue! I don't know!<br />
<br />
373<br />
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,200<br />
Look, look! You go to the cottage<br />
and get a tan! Take David with you!<br />
<br />
374<br />
00:34:03,291 --> 00:34:06,328<br />
I don't care! I'll eat takeout!<br />
I'll do the laundry by myself!<br />
<br />
375<br />
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,397<br />
- I'll vacuum the house! It'll be spotless!<br />
- Dad! Dad!<br />
<br />
376<br />
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,501<br />
- What?<br />
- Art's throwing garbage all over the street.<br />
<br />
377<br />
00:34:10,549 --> 00:34:13,757<br />
Your mom and I are having a conversation!<br />
If you... what?<br />
<br />
378<br />
00:34:15,178 --> 00:34:19,217<br />
- Get out of the truck, man! Are you nuts?<br />
- Hey, it's gotta be in here somewhere.<br />
<br />
379<br />
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:22,515<br />
The supreme court ruled<br />
that a person's garbage...<br />
<br />
380<br />
00:34:22,602 --> 00:34:24,747<br />
- Is public domain the minute it hits the kerb.<br />
- Shut up!<br />
<br />
381<br />
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:26,791<br />
Did you guys pick up<br />
a hefty bag out of that yard...<br />
<br />
382<br />
00:34:26,815 --> 00:34:29,227<br />
That was bulky<br />
and probably a little moist?<br />
<br />
383<br />
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:32,980<br />
- What the hell is wrong with these people?<br />
- He has a right to know, Vic.<br />
<br />
384<br />
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,108<br />
Don't start up with me. Hey, could you<br />
help me get this guy out of here?<br />
<br />
385<br />
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,485<br />
Hey, art. What's happening?<br />
<br />
386<br />
00:34:41,663 --> 00:34:44,700<br />
No! Ray! Ray, come back here!<br />
<br />
387<br />
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,907<br />
Just one... I'll be... yeah!<br />
<br />
388<br />
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:49,334<br />
My taxes pay your salary!<br />
<br />
389<br />
00:34:49,421 --> 00:34:51,582<br />
Look, I don't want to hear<br />
any of your bullshit either!<br />
<br />
390<br />
00:34:51,673 --> 00:34:54,255<br />
The question here is garbage<br />
and who picks up this mess!<br />
<br />
391<br />
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:56,173<br />
Who picks up this mess?<br />
<br />
392<br />
00:34:56,261 --> 00:35:00,470<br />
You're gonna pick up the mess<br />
because you are a garbageman.<br />
<br />
393<br />
00:35:00,557 --> 00:35:03,014<br />
I pick up garbage in cans,<br />
not from the street!<br />
<br />
394<br />
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,968<br />
Ray, there's nothing in here.<br />
We practically checked this whole truck.<br />
<br />
395<br />
00:35:06,062 --> 00:35:08,018<br />
They must have switched on us<br />
during the night.<br />
<br />
396<br />
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,142<br />
- The f.B.1.?<br />
- No, the klopeks.<br />
<br />
397<br />
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:15,398<br />
Oh, no. Naughty little puppy.<br />
<br />
398<br />
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:21,191<br />
Uncle markie gets very upset<br />
when you're on his lawn.<br />
<br />
399<br />
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:26,447<br />
Wait a minute.<br />
You're all dirty, and you're shaking.<br />
<br />
400<br />
00:35:26,541 --> 00:35:29,578<br />
I wonder if Walter knows<br />
you're outside.<br />
<br />
401<br />
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,580<br />
- In the rain?<br />
- Yeah, it was raining.<br />
<br />
402<br />
00:35:31,671 --> 00:35:34,504<br />
- And there were how many of them?<br />
- Well, uh, three.<br />
<br />
403<br />
00:35:34,591 --> 00:35:37,754<br />
- And what were they doing?<br />
- They were diggin'.<br />
<br />
404<br />
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:39,050<br />
Digging! Like grave diggers!<br />
<br />
405<br />
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:41,240<br />
- I told you! They're ghouls!<br />
- No, I didn't say they were graves.<br />
<br />
406<br />
00:35:41,264 --> 00:35:42,658<br />
They could've been digging<br />
for anything.<br />
<br />
407<br />
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:44,923<br />
They could have been digging<br />
for... like night crawlers.<br />
<br />
408<br />
00:35:45,018 --> 00:35:46,974<br />
- Night crawlers?<br />
- They're fishermen.<br />
<br />
409<br />
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:49,849<br />
- Fishermen! Ray, wake up and smell the coffee!<br />
- They need bait.<br />
<br />
410<br />
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,852<br />
The kid spotted us last night.<br />
When we were sleeping, he got up.<br />
<br />
411<br />
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:56,935<br />
He went to the garbage can,<br />
he took the body and then he...<br />
<br />
412<br />
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:00,318<br />
He buried him in the backyard.<br />
<br />
413<br />
00:36:01,076 --> 00:36:03,658<br />
- Let's get outta here.<br />
- It like this.<br />
<br />
414<br />
00:36:03,745 --> 00:36:08,159<br />
I hate cul-de-sacs. There's only one way<br />
out, and the people are kinda weird.<br />
<br />
415<br />
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:11,241<br />
Naked ladies... come on.<br />
<br />
416<br />
00:36:11,336 --> 00:36:15,079<br />
Does anyone know if Walter<br />
left a spare key around anywhere?<br />
<br />
417<br />
00:36:15,173 --> 00:36:18,916<br />
He must have gone away<br />
and forgot to feed queenie.<br />
<br />
418<br />
00:36:22,222 --> 00:36:25,009<br />
- Walter!<br />
- I hope nothing happened to him.<br />
<br />
419<br />
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,388<br />
- I think we should call the police.<br />
- Oh, good plan, ray.<br />
<br />
420<br />
00:36:28,478 --> 00:36:32,141<br />
Wait a minute.<br />
I think I see something moving in there.<br />
<br />
421<br />
00:36:36,152 --> 00:36:38,188<br />
How did you get in there?<br />
<br />
422<br />
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:43,282<br />
A soldier's way saves the day.<br />
Entrez.<br />
<br />
423<br />
00:36:43,368 --> 00:36:45,905<br />
- Good, honey.<br />
- Beautiful.<br />
<br />
424<br />
00:36:46,996 --> 00:36:49,453<br />
- Walter?<br />
- What's been going on here?<br />
<br />
425<br />
00:36:49,541 --> 00:36:51,657<br />
- This doesn't look good.<br />
- Murder, my friend.<br />
<br />
426<br />
00:36:51,751 --> 00:36:54,242<br />
- Murder?<br />
- There are signs of a struggle here.<br />
<br />
427<br />
00:36:54,337 --> 00:36:56,623<br />
The TV's still on.<br />
Chairs turned over.<br />
<br />
428<br />
00:36:56,715 --> 00:36:59,377<br />
I wouldn't say<br />
that's a sign of a struggle.<br />
<br />
429<br />
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,174<br />
You know, I think I should go upstairs<br />
and check this out.<br />
<br />
430<br />
00:37:02,262 --> 00:37:04,924<br />
Maybe the guy's upstairs<br />
in a bathtub or something...<br />
<br />
431<br />
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,552<br />
Cracked his head open,<br />
there's blood and stuff everywhere...<br />
<br />
432<br />
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:13,387<br />
- Just don't touch anything up there, all right?<br />
- Yes, sir, Mr. Peterson.<br />
<br />
433<br />
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:16,473<br />
Come on, let's see<br />
if we can find some dog food.<br />
<br />
434<br />
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:20,231<br />
I don't like this. I don't like<br />
snooping around a neighbor's house.<br />
<br />
435<br />
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,778<br />
You mean a dead guy's house?<br />
<br />
436<br />
00:37:24,033 --> 00:37:27,696<br />
You wanna take that out of your pocket? You<br />
wanna not steal that from Walter's house?<br />
<br />
437<br />
00:37:27,787 --> 00:37:32,076<br />
What's the difference? All this junk is gonna<br />
end up in a flea market sooner or later.<br />
<br />
438<br />
00:37:32,167 --> 00:37:34,954<br />
He might have just left in a hurry<br />
and forgot about the dog.<br />
<br />
439<br />
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:39,913<br />
- Stay right here, and we'll find your dish.<br />
- Old people space out sometimes.<br />
<br />
440<br />
00:37:40,717 --> 00:37:42,253<br />
Bullseye!<br />
<br />
441<br />
00:37:43,011 --> 00:37:46,378<br />
- What, what, what?<br />
- A dead rat! There!<br />
<br />
442<br />
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,133<br />
Honey, that's not a rat.<br />
That's Walter's toupee.<br />
<br />
443<br />
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,970<br />
Oh, jeez. Beautiful place to keep a toupee:<br />
On the stove.<br />
<br />
444<br />
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:59,307<br />
- I'm starving.<br />
- I know one thing about these old guys:<br />
<br />
445<br />
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,940<br />
They don't ever leave the house<br />
without their hair.<br />
<br />
446<br />
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:05,151<br />
No, sir.<br />
<br />
447<br />
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:11,995<br />
Walter left this house...<br />
In a big hurry.<br />
<br />
448<br />
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:14,823<br />
Hey, you guys, look!<br />
These cookies are...<br />
<br />
449<br />
00:38:14,918 --> 00:38:17,409<br />
- That's great! Everybody out!<br />
- Great, Ricky. Very nice...<br />
<br />
450<br />
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:20,086<br />
- Very nice!<br />
- I think we've broken enough laws for one day.<br />
<br />
451<br />
00:38:20,173 --> 00:38:21,984<br />
- I'm sorry, but we have not looked...<br />
- Let's just get outta here.<br />
<br />
452<br />
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:26,001<br />
- It's not against the law to break cookies.<br />
- I can't believe you people talked me into this.<br />
<br />
453<br />
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:28,882<br />
Why don't we just get out<br />
of our neighbor's house?<br />
<br />
454<br />
00:38:28,973 --> 00:38:31,510<br />
"Walter, your dog is at my house.<br />
<br />
455<br />
00:38:31,601 --> 00:38:35,469<br />
Your window is broken<br />
because we all thought that..."<br />
<br />
456<br />
00:38:39,859 --> 00:38:41,565<br />
"Walter...<br />
<br />
457<br />
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:45,195<br />
1 have your dog.<br />
<br />
458<br />
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,027<br />
Ray."<br />
<br />
459<br />
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,007<br />
Mr. klopek!<br />
<br />
460<br />
00:39:06,094 --> 00:39:08,801<br />
Mr. klopek, hi. Ray Peterson.<br />
<br />
461<br />
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:10,719<br />
Listen, I was w...<br />
<br />
462<br />
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,982<br />
What is this doggy-gram? This just<br />
came for you. It might be important.<br />
<br />
463<br />
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,653<br />
Come here. Save some for your friend.<br />
Right there. Go on.<br />
<br />
464<br />
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,856<br />
- Honey, have you seen your father?<br />
- I think he's in the basement with art.<br />
<br />
465<br />
00:39:29,951 --> 00:39:32,567<br />
He's playing canasta<br />
or something.<br />
<br />
466<br />
00:39:35,915 --> 00:39:37,405<br />
Honey?<br />
<br />
467<br />
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,241<br />
Ray!<br />
<br />
468<br />
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:44,121<br />
Art, you had a dream<br />
you were gonna win the lottery.<br />
<br />
469<br />
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,861<br />
- You blew $500 on tickets.<br />
- I can't believe you're still bringing that up.<br />
<br />
470<br />
00:39:46,885 --> 00:39:49,843<br />
You had a dream a plane was gonna crash,<br />
so you took the bus to Las Vegas.<br />
<br />
471<br />
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,866<br />
If I had been on the plane,<br />
it would have crashed.<br />
<br />
472<br />
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,802<br />
And it doesn't matter.<br />
This wasn't a dream. This was a vision.<br />
<br />
473<br />
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:56,620<br />
- These people are satanists.<br />
- This is all gibberish.<br />
<br />
474<br />
00:39:56,644 --> 00:39:58,225<br />
As I sit here,<br />
they're satansists.<br />
<br />
475<br />
00:39:58,313 --> 00:40:00,804<br />
Look, the world is full of these<br />
kind of things. Look at this.<br />
<br />
476<br />
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:04,107<br />
Black masses, mutilations.<br />
Mutilations!<br />
<br />
477<br />
00:40:04,193 --> 00:40:10,484<br />
The incubus, the succubus. I'm telling<br />
you, Walter was a human sacrifice.<br />
<br />
478<br />
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:14,113<br />
I should have gone to the lake.<br />
I should have listened to Carol.<br />
<br />
479<br />
00:40:14,203 --> 00:40:18,162<br />
Listen to your wife? Who listens to<br />
their wife? You gotta listen to me.<br />
<br />
480<br />
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:21,332<br />
We gotta go down<br />
to the religious supply store.<br />
<br />
481<br />
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:23,606<br />
We gotta get ourselves<br />
a couple of gallons of holy water.<br />
<br />
482<br />
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,837<br />
My cousin is a priest.<br />
He can get us a deal.<br />
<br />
483<br />
00:40:25,924 --> 00:40:28,027<br />
- Then we gotta go to the market.<br />
- I don't want to hear this.<br />
<br />
484<br />
00:40:28,051 --> 00:40:32,511<br />
- We gotta get oursleves these big strings of garlic.<br />
- I'm not gonna listen.<br />
<br />
485<br />
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,885<br />
- We gotta get some fresh lamb's blood.<br />
- I'm not going to hear this.<br />
<br />
486<br />
00:40:35,975 --> 00:40:38,078<br />
Ray, do you want 'em<br />
to take your family, kidnap 'em...<br />
<br />
487<br />
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,185<br />
Tear their livers out<br />
and make some satanic pate?<br />
<br />
488<br />
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,479<br />
I'm not going to listen to this.<br />
<br />
489<br />
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:46,854<br />
- Ray, you're chanting. Ray.<br />
- I'm not going to hear this now.<br />
<br />
490<br />
00:40:46,945 --> 00:40:50,938<br />
Ray, look. Ray.<br />
Unconscious chanting. You're chanting!<br />
<br />
491<br />
00:40:51,032 --> 00:40:53,569<br />
I want to kill everyone.<br />
<br />
492<br />
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:56,447<br />
Satan is good. Satan is our pal.<br />
<br />
493<br />
00:40:56,537 --> 00:41:00,871<br />
Ray, ray, you're chanting.<br />
Hey...<br />
<br />
494<br />
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:06,204<br />
Once they get in here,<br />
it's over, pal.<br />
<br />
495<br />
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:11,086<br />
Satanists, huh?<br />
<br />
496<br />
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:13,793<br />
Ritual killers?<br />
<br />
497<br />
00:41:13,888 --> 00:41:17,380<br />
Nice. Very, very nice.<br />
<br />
498<br />
00:41:17,934 --> 00:41:19,720<br />
So let me get this straight.<br />
<br />
499<br />
00:41:19,811 --> 00:41:24,805<br />
The klopeks are offering up Walter<br />
as a sort of human sacrifice to beelzebub?<br />
<br />
500<br />
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:28,733<br />
- Is that it?<br />
- That's one of the theories. Yeah.<br />
<br />
501<br />
00:41:30,113 --> 00:41:32,195<br />
Great, great.<br />
<br />
502<br />
00:41:32,281 --> 00:41:36,024<br />
So this is your<br />
relaxing week at home, huh?<br />
<br />
503<br />
00:41:36,119 --> 00:41:38,656<br />
I wouldn't have missed this<br />
for the worid.<br />
<br />
504<br />
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:42,079<br />
- A week in Jonestown.<br />
- Where are you going?<br />
<br />
505<br />
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,374<br />
To the bathroom. Relax.<br />
<br />
506<br />
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:12,519<br />
What is it?<br />
<br />
507<br />
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,572<br />
Carol?<br />
<br />
508<br />
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,717<br />
Carol?<br />
<br />
509<br />
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,092<br />
Carol?<br />
<br />
510<br />
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,283<br />
Ray...<br />
<br />
511<br />
00:43:52,171 --> 00:43:54,628<br />
Ray...<br />
<br />
512<br />
00:43:54,715 --> 00:44:00,756<br />
It was so nice of you to invite<br />
the new neighbors over for a barbecue, ray.<br />
<br />
513<br />
00:44:13,818 --> 00:44:18,482<br />
Satan is good. Satan is our pal.<br />
I want to kill everyone.<br />
<br />
514<br />
00:44:18,573 --> 00:44:20,859<br />
Satan is good. Satan is our pal.<br />
<br />
515<br />
00:44:31,294 --> 00:44:34,377<br />
Oh, ray Peterson...<br />
<br />
516<br />
00:44:34,463 --> 00:44:39,457<br />
Whatever you do,<br />
don't let them do to you...<br />
<br />
517<br />
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:44,342<br />
- What they did to me.<br />
- Oh, I bet that hurts, huh?<br />
<br />
518<br />
00:44:53,649 --> 00:44:55,560<br />
Hey, hey, hey!<br />
<br />
519<br />
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:58,893<br />
Who the heck<br />
ordered the blood shake?<br />
<br />
520<br />
00:44:59,530 --> 00:45:03,273<br />
Hey, ray. It's not skip. It's me, art.<br />
I'm just pretending to be skip.<br />
<br />
521<br />
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:07,110<br />
Hey, you didn't happen to see an ice pick<br />
around here, did you?<br />
<br />
522<br />
00:45:07,997 --> 00:45:11,455<br />
Mind your own business.<br />
<br />
523<br />
00:45:12,293 --> 00:45:15,626<br />
Mind your own business!<br />
<br />
524<br />
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:17,920<br />
Okay!<br />
<br />
525<br />
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:23,760<br />
It's a beautiful day<br />
in this neighborhood<br />
<br />
526<br />
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:26,303<br />
it's a beautiful day<br />
for a neighbor<br />
<br />
527<br />
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:30,053<br />
would you be mine<br />
could you be mine<br />
<br />
528<br />
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,760<br />
it's a neighborly day<br />
in this beauty wood<br />
<br />
529<br />
00:45:32,855 --> 00:45:35,062<br />
a neighborly day for a beauty<br />
<br />
530<br />
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:39,267<br />
would you be mine<br />
could you be mine<br />
<br />
531<br />
00:45:39,362 --> 00:45:42,274<br />
I have always wanted<br />
to have a neighbor<br />
<br />
532<br />
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:44,526<br />
just like you<br />
<br />
533<br />
00:45:44,617 --> 00:45:49,486<br />
I've always wanted to live<br />
in the neighborhood with you<br />
<br />
534<br />
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:55,246<br />
so let's make the most<br />
of this beautiful day<br />
<br />
535<br />
00:45:55,336 --> 00:45:58,920<br />
since we're together<br />
I might as well say<br />
<br />
536<br />
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,873<br />
would you be mine<br />
could you be mine<br />
<br />
537<br />
00:46:01,968 --> 00:46:04,926<br />
won't you be my neighbor<br />
<br />
538<br />
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:09,551<br />
won't you please<br />
won't you please<br />
<br />
539<br />
00:46:09,642 --> 00:46:13,555<br />
please, won't you be my neighbor<br />
<br />
540<br />
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:17,810<br />
hey, ray!<br />
Ray, we got a plan! Come on.<br />
<br />
541<br />
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:21,734<br />
We got a plan.<br />
Come on. We got... oh...<br />
<br />
542<br />
00:46:22,405 --> 00:46:25,442<br />
Sorry, boys. My husband's not feeling well.<br />
He has to stay in his room.<br />
<br />
543<br />
00:46:25,533 --> 00:46:28,275<br />
- Ooh, he was bad.<br />
- Come on.<br />
<br />
544<br />
00:46:28,369 --> 00:46:31,076<br />
Please, Carol, let him come out.<br />
<br />
545<br />
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,580<br />
Come on...<br />
<br />
546<br />
00:46:32,665 --> 00:46:35,873<br />
He can't come out until he resembles<br />
the man that I married.<br />
<br />
547<br />
00:46:35,960 --> 00:46:39,578<br />
- We don't have that kind of time. Come on.<br />
- Please let him come out.<br />
<br />
548<br />
00:46:39,672 --> 00:46:42,914<br />
I think that I have given you<br />
my answer.<br />
<br />
549<br />
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:11,492<br />
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<br />
The bees came from there.<br />
<br />
550<br />
00:47:11,579 --> 00:47:15,618<br />
- And watch this hole.<br />
- Okay, let's try the side door.<br />
<br />
551<br />
00:47:29,138 --> 00:47:31,094<br />
Okay, do it.<br />
<br />
552<br />
00:47:31,640 --> 00:47:35,758<br />
Do what?<br />
We agreed to do it together.<br />
<br />
553<br />
00:48:08,135 --> 00:48:12,219<br />
- Ray. Ray.<br />
- I'm only trying to take a nap.<br />
<br />
554<br />
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,673<br />
I'm only laying here with my eyes closed,<br />
trying to get some goddamn sleep.<br />
<br />
555<br />
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:18,555<br />
Quiet, quiet, quiet.<br />
I wouldn't wake you if it wasn't important.<br />
<br />
556<br />
00:48:18,646 --> 00:48:21,353<br />
- I think we flushed 'em out. The klopeks!<br />
- Okay.<br />
<br />
557<br />
00:48:21,440 --> 00:48:24,682<br />
- Rumsfield and I, we flushed 'em out.<br />
- How?<br />
<br />
558<br />
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,588<br />
We wrote a note.<br />
We slipped it under their door.<br />
<br />
559<br />
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,898<br />
- We rang the bell, and then we ran.<br />
- You did that?<br />
<br />
560<br />
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:32,231<br />
- Yeah.<br />
- Oh, geez! Stupid idi...<br />
<br />
561<br />
00:48:32,326 --> 00:48:34,442<br />
I can't believe you...<br />
<br />
562<br />
00:48:37,706 --> 00:48:40,573<br />
All I did was write,<br />
"I know what you've done." That's all.<br />
<br />
563<br />
00:48:40,668 --> 00:48:43,501<br />
- I didn't sign it or anything.<br />
- Oh, I can't... you stupid...<br />
<br />
564<br />
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:47,171<br />
- Why didn't you... god!<br />
- You gotta goose these people once in a while.<br />
<br />
565<br />
00:48:47,258 --> 00:48:50,876<br />
You gotta give them a little shot, a little<br />
whack. Let 'em know that you're there!<br />
<br />
566<br />
00:48:50,970 --> 00:48:53,006<br />
Jeez... good dog, Vince.<br />
Go get it.<br />
<br />
567<br />
00:48:53,097 --> 00:48:56,214<br />
Here's the thing, though, art.<br />
They're gonna think I did it.<br />
<br />
568<br />
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,515<br />
- Why?<br />
- The old guy saw me write a note...<br />
<br />
569<br />
00:48:58,602 --> 00:49:03,266<br />
And put it under Walter's door.<br />
So they're gonna think that I did it!<br />
<br />
570<br />
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:06,770<br />
You wrote a note and put it under the...<br />
I didn't know that.<br />
<br />
571<br />
00:49:06,861 --> 00:49:09,603<br />
It doesn't matter<br />
'cause we got 'em on the run now!<br />
<br />
572<br />
00:49:09,697 --> 00:49:11,675<br />
Now they know that we know<br />
that they know that we know!<br />
<br />
573<br />
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:15,157<br />
Yes, it does matter!<br />
You did it, but they're gonna suspect me!<br />
<br />
574<br />
00:49:15,244 --> 00:49:18,361<br />
They're not gonna suspect anybody.<br />
They're...<br />
<br />
575<br />
00:49:27,548 --> 00:49:31,132<br />
- Do you know what this is?<br />
- It's a bone.<br />
<br />
576<br />
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:34,460<br />
- It's a femur.<br />
- [T's a femur bone.<br />
<br />
577<br />
00:49:36,724 --> 00:49:41,058<br />
A femur just happens to be<br />
a human thigh bone, ray.<br />
<br />
578<br />
00:49:42,396 --> 00:49:45,684<br />
- Wait, how do you know that?<br />
- Biology 101.<br />
<br />
579<br />
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:49,141<br />
I mean,<br />
look at the size of this thing.<br />
<br />
580<br />
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:51,568<br />
Think this came off<br />
a chicken or something?<br />
<br />
581<br />
00:49:51,655 --> 00:49:54,442<br />
Where the hell<br />
did Vince get this?<br />
<br />
582<br />
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,285<br />
He dug it up<br />
from underneath the fence.<br />
<br />
583<br />
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:08,415<br />
Ray...<br />
<br />
584<br />
00:50:09,256 --> 00:50:11,713<br />
Ray, there's no doubt anymore.<br />
<br />
585<br />
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,634<br />
This is real.<br />
Your neighbors are murdering people.<br />
<br />
586<br />
00:50:15,721 --> 00:50:20,431<br />
They're chopping 'em up.<br />
They're burying 'em in their backyard.<br />
<br />
587<br />
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,057<br />
Ray, this is Walter.<br />
<br />
588<br />
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,229<br />
- No!<br />
- No!<br />
<br />
589<br />
00:50:44,667 --> 00:50:48,535<br />
There's just got to be<br />
some other explanation for this.<br />
<br />
590<br />
00:50:51,465 --> 00:50:55,674<br />
It's just some litter.<br />
The guy's a litterbug.<br />
<br />
591<br />
00:50:56,554 --> 00:51:00,797<br />
It could be a candy bar wrapper.<br />
It could be a napkin.<br />
<br />
592<br />
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:05,476<br />
It could be a crumpled up credit card receipt.<br />
Those things blow around all the time.<br />
<br />
593<br />
00:51:05,563 --> 00:51:08,521<br />
It, it, uh... no, it's my note.<br />
<br />
594<br />
00:51:11,944 --> 00:51:15,107<br />
- Oh! Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry!<br />
- Ouch!<br />
<br />
595<br />
00:51:15,197 --> 00:51:18,314<br />
I didn't see you.<br />
I didn't see you.<br />
<br />
596<br />
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:23,281<br />
Great. Crush a beer can.<br />
You feel better now?<br />
<br />
597<br />
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:30,577<br />
Well... I think it's time<br />
we all stopped acting like kindergartners.<br />
<br />
598<br />
00:51:30,671 --> 00:51:34,414<br />
- Don't you, ray?<br />
- Yes, Carol.<br />
<br />
599<br />
00:51:35,551 --> 00:51:38,964<br />
Now, before somebody falls off a roof<br />
or sets themselves on fire...<br />
<br />
600<br />
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,991<br />
I think we should go over there,<br />
knock on their door...<br />
<br />
601<br />
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:43,802<br />
And invite ourselves in<br />
for a nice, neighborly chat.<br />
<br />
602<br />
00:51:43,892 --> 00:51:46,929<br />
Get to know these people<br />
like we should have done a month ago.<br />
<br />
603<br />
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:50,559<br />
That's a good idea.<br />
And I'll make brownies.<br />
<br />
604<br />
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:55,234<br />
- Great. While you keep 'em busy, I...<br />
- You're not invited.<br />
<br />
605<br />
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,083<br />
- Can't we do this tomorrow, Carol?<br />
- Would you relax?<br />
<br />
606<br />
00:52:19,178 --> 00:52:22,261<br />
We'll probably find out more<br />
in five minutes of friendly chat...<br />
<br />
607<br />
00:52:22,348 --> 00:52:25,840<br />
Than you guys can in a month<br />
of snooping around.<br />
<br />
608<br />
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:35,895<br />
Okay, now,<br />
everybody just act normal.<br />
<br />
609<br />
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:47,950<br />
- Who is it?<br />
- Yoo-hoo! It's Carol Peterson from next door.<br />
<br />
610<br />
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,952<br />
There go the goddamn brownies.<br />
<br />
611<br />
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:03,044<br />
Hi. Welcome to Mayfield place.<br />
We're your neighbors.<br />
<br />
612<br />
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:05,470<br />
We brought dessert...<br />
<br />
613<br />
00:53:07,643 --> 00:53:10,134<br />
Uh, is your mother home?<br />
<br />
614<br />
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:15,565<br />
Here you go, Sonny.<br />
A little something for the old sweet tooth.<br />
<br />
615<br />
00:53:29,081 --> 00:53:31,572<br />
I can't believe<br />
you've lived here a whole month...<br />
<br />
616<br />
00:53:31,667 --> 00:53:34,204<br />
And we haven't come by<br />
to say hello.<br />
<br />
617<br />
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:39,709<br />
Well, I'm your neighbor, ray Peterson,<br />
and that's my wife, Carol.<br />
<br />
618<br />
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:42,257<br />
That's Bonnie,<br />
and this is, uh...<br />
<br />
619<br />
00:53:42,344 --> 00:53:44,426<br />
Rumsfield's the name.<br />
<br />
620<br />
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:47,505<br />
Don't think<br />
I caught yours, Sonny.<br />
<br />
621<br />
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,464<br />
- Hans.<br />
- Hans!<br />
<br />
622<br />
00:53:49,560 --> 00:53:54,520<br />
A fine, Christian name.<br />
Hans Christian andersen.<br />
<br />
623<br />
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:57,977<br />
- What, are you catholic?<br />
- I don't know.<br />
<br />
624<br />
00:54:00,946 --> 00:54:03,779<br />
Oh. Pretty girl.<br />
<br />
625<br />
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:08,200<br />
- Friend of yours?<br />
- No, it came with the frame.<br />
<br />
626<br />
00:54:08,287 --> 00:54:10,619<br />
- "Tt came with the frame"?<br />
- Yes.<br />
<br />
627<br />
00:54:10,706 --> 00:54:15,621<br />
Oh, is this the dining room?<br />
Oh! You startled me.<br />
<br />
628<br />
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:19,836<br />
- My uncle Reuben.<br />
- Well, how do you do?<br />
<br />
629<br />
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:27,719<br />
You are the one<br />
who lives next door.<br />
<br />
630<br />
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:32,637<br />
- Um... why don't we get some coffee, Bonnie?<br />
- T'l do it.<br />
<br />
631<br />
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:37,267<br />
What do you say we all sit down<br />
for a little face-to-face, eh, what, reub?<br />
<br />
632<br />
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:41,066<br />
They're in there, alright.<br />
They're all just standing around.<br />
<br />
633<br />
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:45,692<br />
Oh, great. Don't worry, you guys.<br />
I can get this. Don't worry about it.<br />
<br />
634<br />
00:54:45,783 --> 00:54:49,571<br />
- I really appreciate your help. Really.<br />
- No problem. Just be careful.<br />
<br />
635<br />
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:54,075<br />
- I mean, it's pretty dangerous with the trip wire.<br />
- Yeah, yeah, okay. Thanks for your advice.<br />
<br />
636<br />
00:54:54,166 --> 00:54:55,702<br />
- Watch!<br />
- Be careful!<br />
<br />
637<br />
00:54:55,793 --> 00:54:57,533<br />
I'm watchin'.<br />
<br />
638<br />
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:00,710<br />
Did you make it?<br />
<br />
639<br />
00:55:03,509 --> 00:55:06,467<br />
I'm alright! I'm okay, I'm okay.<br />
<br />
640<br />
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:09,340<br />
Just throw me over the tools.<br />
<br />
641<br />
00:55:55,853 --> 00:55:59,220<br />
Sure was damp today.<br />
<br />
642<br />
00:55:59,314 --> 00:56:03,023<br />
Yes, I just can't seem<br />
to do anything with my hair.<br />
<br />
643<br />
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:25,078<br />
Sardine?<br />
<br />
644<br />
00:56:27,634 --> 00:56:30,421<br />
I'm trying to cut back.<br />
<br />
645<br />
00:56:31,805 --> 00:56:33,716<br />
Sardine?<br />
<br />
646<br />
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:32,154<br />
Um... so, how are you<br />
enjoying Hinkley hills?<br />
<br />
647<br />
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,572<br />
We just love it.<br />
<br />
648<br />
00:57:34,660 --> 00:57:37,322<br />
- Don't we?<br />
- Yes!<br />
<br />
649<br />
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:40,700<br />
Klopek. What is that, slavic?<br />
<br />
650<br />
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,496<br />
No!<br />
<br />
651<br />
00:57:46,546 --> 00:57:50,255<br />
About a nine<br />
on the tension scale, reub.<br />
<br />
652<br />
00:57:50,342 --> 00:57:52,958<br />
How do you like<br />
living here so far, huh?<br />
<br />
653<br />
00:57:53,053 --> 00:57:55,669<br />
Pretty comfortable house,<br />
ain't it?<br />
<br />
654<br />
00:57:56,765 --> 00:57:58,756<br />
Good, solid walls.<br />
<br />
655<br />
00:58:00,769 --> 00:58:02,760<br />
Good, solid floors.<br />
<br />
656<br />
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:14,321<br />
Got somebody tied up in the old cellar,<br />
have you, reub?<br />
<br />
657<br />
00:58:34,136 --> 00:58:36,718<br />
It's packing dust. I'm sorry.<br />
<br />
658<br />
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:42,759<br />
So... just you and unc living here<br />
in the house, is that it, Sonny?<br />
<br />
659<br />
00:58:42,853 --> 00:58:46,641<br />
- No...<br />
- Please, this is a small family:<br />
<br />
660<br />
00:58:46,732 --> 00:58:49,974<br />
Me, the young boy...<br />
<br />
661<br />
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:54,732<br />
And my brother... the doctor.<br />
<br />
662<br />
00:58:54,823 --> 00:58:58,532<br />
Well, won't it be nice to have<br />
a doctor in the neighborhood?<br />
<br />
663<br />
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:07,124<br />
You know, I think it's great you've been<br />
able to stay with all the original wood.<br />
<br />
664<br />
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:10,293<br />
I was never over here<br />
when the knapps lived here.<br />
<br />
665<br />
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:14,123<br />
How unfortunate for the knapps.<br />
<br />
666<br />
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:20,050<br />
You know, it's funny, but I don't ever<br />
remember seeing a moving Van out front.<br />
<br />
667<br />
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:24,975<br />
I don't understand that.<br />
It was parked outside all day!<br />
<br />
668<br />
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:29,226<br />
- Really?<br />
- Say, how is, uh...<br />
<br />
669<br />
00:59:29,316 --> 00:59:34,026<br />
The... drainage<br />
on your property here?<br />
<br />
670<br />
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:40,403<br />
I know when it rains at our house,<br />
boy, the basement just floods right over.<br />
<br />
671<br />
00:59:40,494 --> 00:59:44,783<br />
Basement...?<br />
Ray comes up with a winning idea.<br />
<br />
672<br />
00:59:44,873 --> 00:59:47,018<br />
Maybe we should go down<br />
and take a look in the basement.<br />
<br />
673<br />
00:59:47,042 --> 00:59:51,126<br />
Maybe that was brother down there, tapping<br />
on the ceiling a couple minutes ago.<br />
<br />
674<br />
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:53,169<br />
Who knows?<br />
<br />
675<br />
00:59:56,676 --> 01:00:00,214<br />
Just what kind of doctor<br />
is this brother of yours, reub?<br />
<br />
676<br />
01:00:00,305 --> 01:00:02,887<br />
Why don't you ask him yourself?<br />
<br />
677<br />
01:00:38,468 --> 01:00:41,255<br />
Ah, we have guests.<br />
<br />
678<br />
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,587<br />
Sort of.<br />
<br />
679<br />
01:00:43,682 --> 01:00:46,924<br />
My brother, the doctor.<br />
<br />
680<br />
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:53,935<br />
Werner klopek.<br />
How nice to meet you.<br />
<br />
681<br />
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,310<br />
Ray Peterson.<br />
<br />
682<br />
01:00:56,528 --> 01:00:59,065<br />
Oh, pardon my glove.<br />
<br />
683<br />
01:01:47,787 --> 01:01:52,281<br />
I thought the candles would be romantic...<br />
For the ladies.<br />
<br />
684<br />
01:01:53,043 --> 01:01:56,706<br />
- They're lovely.<br />
- I really must apologize for the paint.<br />
<br />
685<br />
01:01:56,796 --> 01:02:00,380<br />
I was just touching up<br />
one of my pictures.<br />
<br />
686<br />
01:02:00,467 --> 01:02:04,380<br />
I find painting relaxes me.<br />
<br />
687<br />
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:16,020<br />
Sugar substitute?<br />
<br />
688<br />
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,727<br />
No, thank you.<br />
<br />
689<br />
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:23,278<br />
It was impolite of us<br />
not to have introduced ourselves sooner.<br />
<br />
690<br />
01:02:23,365 --> 01:02:26,778<br />
I find my work<br />
is rather solitary.<br />
<br />
691<br />
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:31,362<br />
It always keeps us on the move.<br />
<br />
692<br />
01:02:31,456 --> 01:02:35,415<br />
Did you know we've had to move<br />
four times in as many years?<br />
<br />
693<br />
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:40,371<br />
Oh, all that moving must be<br />
very hard on you, hans.<br />
<br />
694<br />
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:44,841<br />
Indeed. And tomorrow...<br />
<br />
695<br />
01:02:44,928 --> 01:02:47,761<br />
Tomorrow we must all<br />
go to the university...<br />
<br />
696<br />
01:02:47,847 --> 01:02:50,930<br />
To discuss yet another transfer.<br />
<br />
697<br />
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:53,474<br />
No... and we're just<br />
getting to know you.<br />
<br />
698<br />
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:56,849<br />
That's a shame.<br />
Isn't that a shame, honey?<br />
<br />
699<br />
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,896<br />
That's a shame.<br />
<br />
700<br />
01:02:58,984 --> 01:03:01,225<br />
Says who?<br />
<br />
701<br />
01:03:02,529 --> 01:03:08,195<br />
And I was just remarking<br />
to hans... today...<br />
<br />
702<br />
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,868<br />
How nice it would be...<br />
<br />
703<br />
01:03:11,955 --> 01:03:14,071<br />
To meet all of our<br />
new neighbors...<br />
<br />
704<br />
01:03:14,165 --> 01:03:16,872<br />
And here you are.<br />
<br />
705<br />
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:20,289<br />
Actually, doc,<br />
we're not all here.<br />
<br />
706<br />
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:26,212<br />
Walter, the old man next door.<br />
We don't know where the hell he is.<br />
<br />
707<br />
01:03:26,303 --> 01:03:28,214<br />
Oh, god! Jesus Christ!<br />
<br />
708<br />
01:03:28,305 --> 01:03:31,388<br />
Sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Ow!<br />
<br />
709<br />
01:03:31,474 --> 01:03:35,808<br />
Terrible, terrible thing,<br />
the plight of the elderly.<br />
<br />
710<br />
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:38,762<br />
We were just remarking the other day<br />
about how an old guy like that...<br />
<br />
711<br />
01:03:38,857 --> 01:03:42,099<br />
Could just drop off<br />
the face of the earth without a sign.<br />
<br />
712<br />
01:03:42,193 --> 01:03:46,277<br />
Vanish. No one ever see him again.<br />
No trace. Nothing.<br />
<br />
713<br />
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:50,236<br />
Right, ray? Yesterday, wasn't it? We were<br />
just talking about it yesterday afternoon.<br />
<br />
714<br />
01:03:50,327 --> 01:03:52,568<br />
I bet you were.<br />
<br />
715<br />
01:03:55,623 --> 01:03:58,990<br />
Look, why don't we just cut<br />
all this polite crap, alright?<br />
<br />
716<br />
01:03:59,085 --> 01:04:01,952<br />
What's the weird goddamn noise<br />
you got comin' outta here all the time?<br />
<br />
717<br />
01:04:02,047 --> 01:04:03,537<br />
Uh, I think we should go...<br />
<br />
718<br />
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:07,715<br />
- What have you got in the cellar, herr klopek?<br />
- Mark!<br />
<br />
719<br />
01:04:08,678 --> 01:04:13,217<br />
Ray, come on!<br />
Tell 'em what you saw. Tell 'em.<br />
<br />
720<br />
01:04:13,308 --> 01:04:17,426<br />
- I have to use your bathroom.<br />
- Ray, remember night before last?<br />
<br />
721<br />
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,978<br />
- You said they were digging. Ray!<br />
- Don't open that!<br />
<br />
722<br />
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,396<br />
You keep a horse<br />
in the basement?<br />
<br />
723<br />
01:04:47,550 --> 01:04:51,839<br />
- Is it a burglar?<br />
- No, it's art.<br />
<br />
724<br />
01:04:53,765 --> 01:04:57,349<br />
- Another neighbor?<br />
- A fat one.<br />
<br />
725<br />
01:04:58,937 --> 01:05:01,303<br />
Go on, you mangy mutt!<br />
<br />
726<br />
01:05:04,109 --> 01:05:07,852<br />
I'm sorry<br />
if landru frightened you.<br />
<br />
727<br />
01:05:07,946 --> 01:05:11,530<br />
- His size tends to overwhelm people.<br />
- Oh, no, no.<br />
<br />
728<br />
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:15,234<br />
We've imposed on you enough for one<br />
evening. It's been lovely meeting you.<br />
<br />
729<br />
01:05:15,328 --> 01:05:17,660<br />
- See you, doc. Later, reub.<br />
- Bye, hans.<br />
<br />
730<br />
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:21,239<br />
Yes, doctor. It's been real.<br />
<br />
731<br />
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:23,704<br />
- Are you alright?<br />
- Yes, I'm fine.<br />
<br />
732<br />
01:05:23,795 --> 01:05:26,832<br />
Let's do this again sometime...<br />
Real soon.<br />
<br />
733<br />
01:05:26,923 --> 01:05:31,257<br />
- We'll see ourselves to the door. Honey?<br />
- Good night!<br />
<br />
734<br />
01:05:35,807 --> 01:05:38,514<br />
Okay, okay, I admit it.<br />
They're slightly eccentric.<br />
<br />
735<br />
01:05:38,601 --> 01:05:40,432<br />
"Slightly eccentric"? Carol...<br />
<br />
736<br />
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:42,385<br />
- But that doesn't mean...<br />
- Come on!<br />
<br />
737<br />
01:05:42,480 --> 01:05:45,813<br />
- They chopped Walter into little pieces!<br />
- These people are clearly psychos!<br />
<br />
738<br />
01:05:47,360 --> 01:05:49,897<br />
Ray, what do you think?<br />
<br />
739<br />
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:54,189<br />
Yeah, what do you think?<br />
<br />
740<br />
01:05:56,035 --> 01:05:59,323<br />
Right. Been awfully quiet, ray.<br />
<br />
741<br />
01:05:59,414 --> 01:06:03,157<br />
Maybe we could have<br />
a little participation here.<br />
<br />
742<br />
01:06:03,710 --> 01:06:07,453<br />
I think they're clean.<br />
I think Bonnie and Carol are right.<br />
<br />
743<br />
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,788<br />
- See?<br />
- That's great, ray.<br />
<br />
744<br />
01:06:09,883 --> 01:06:12,545<br />
Just pull open the door,<br />
pull the rip cord and bail out on us.<br />
<br />
745<br />
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,548<br />
That's rich, considering you're the one<br />
who started this whole thing to begin with.<br />
<br />
746<br />
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:18,284<br />
- Who started it, tuna neck?<br />
- "Tuna neck"?<br />
<br />
747<br />
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:19,910<br />
- You instigated this whole damn thing!<br />
- You know who instigated this?<br />
<br />
748<br />
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,620<br />
Your little boy watching people dig<br />
in the backyard!<br />
<br />
749<br />
01:06:21,644 --> 01:06:25,102<br />
- You leave my...<br />
- Honey, would you and Bonnie excuse us?<br />
<br />
750<br />
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:29,479<br />
I think I should have a talk<br />
with the boys in the den for a few minutes.<br />
<br />
751<br />
01:06:29,569 --> 01:06:31,275<br />
Okay.<br />
<br />
752<br />
01:06:32,405 --> 01:06:35,772<br />
It's good to see you've<br />
come to your senses, sweetie.<br />
<br />
753<br />
01:06:36,910 --> 01:06:39,117<br />
Just a minute or two.<br />
<br />
754<br />
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:54,958<br />
So, what's the deal, ray?<br />
<br />
755<br />
01:06:55,053 --> 01:06:58,762<br />
Are you siding with the chicks against us?<br />
Is that it?<br />
<br />
756<br />
01:06:58,848 --> 01:07:02,306<br />
Yeah, are you totally<br />
pussy-whipped or what?<br />
<br />
757<br />
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:04,805<br />
Just take your balls<br />
out of your wife's purse.<br />
<br />
758<br />
01:07:04,896 --> 01:07:08,138<br />
Make a stand<br />
for one time in your life.<br />
<br />
759<br />
01:07:08,900 --> 01:07:09,900<br />
Hey, ray, come on!<br />
<br />
760<br />
01:07:09,943 --> 01:07:13,481<br />
- It's just a figure of speech!<br />
- It's a joke. He's kiddin' around.<br />
<br />
761<br />
01:07:13,571 --> 01:07:15,311<br />
Oh, it's Walter's rug.<br />
<br />
762<br />
01:07:15,406 --> 01:07:17,692<br />
So you got an old guy's wig.<br />
Big deal.<br />
<br />
763<br />
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:21,197<br />
You've had that<br />
in your trousers all day?<br />
<br />
764<br />
01:07:22,664 --> 01:07:26,657<br />
After you found this<br />
in Walter's house yesterday...<br />
<br />
765<br />
01:07:26,751 --> 01:07:30,790<br />
I slipped it back in<br />
through the mail slot.<br />
<br />
766<br />
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:35,291<br />
- Yeah?<br />
- Where did you get it this time?<br />
<br />
767<br />
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:39,927<br />
Klopeks? Wow...<br />
<br />
768<br />
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,847<br />
After the dog came up<br />
out of the basement...<br />
<br />
769<br />
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:45,175<br />
I found it wedged<br />
between a bunch of magazines...<br />
<br />
770<br />
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:48,433<br />
All of which, I might add,<br />
were addressed to Walter.<br />
<br />
771<br />
01:07:48,523 --> 01:07:52,107<br />
Well, then...<br />
Then that means that...<br />
<br />
772<br />
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:57,153<br />
Klopeks went back<br />
inside Walter's house...<br />
<br />
773<br />
01:07:57,240 --> 01:08:00,027<br />
And got the hair.<br />
<br />
774<br />
01:08:04,706 --> 01:08:07,539<br />
What do we do now, soldier?<br />
<br />
775<br />
01:08:07,625 --> 01:08:10,617<br />
You heard them say<br />
they were going away tomorrow.<br />
<br />
776<br />
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:15,081<br />
- Yeah...<br />
- As soon as that car leaves in the morning...<br />
<br />
777<br />
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:20,464<br />
I'm going over the fence and I'm not<br />
comin' back 'til I find a dead body.<br />
<br />
778<br />
01:08:21,389 --> 01:08:26,383<br />
Nobody knocks off an old man<br />
in my neighborhood and gets away with it.<br />
<br />
779<br />
01:09:22,533 --> 01:09:26,492<br />
Gentlemen, we are on alert.<br />
<br />
780<br />
01:09:27,038 --> 01:09:28,369<br />
Honey, you know<br />
what you could do?<br />
<br />
781<br />
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:32,165<br />
Go get those flag stones at the garden<br />
center and put them along the walk.<br />
<br />
782<br />
01:09:32,251 --> 01:09:33,957<br />
Yeah, that'd be a hice project.<br />
<br />
783<br />
01:09:34,045 --> 01:09:37,833<br />
I've got a foursome lined up with art today<br />
in an hour and a half though.<br />
<br />
784<br />
01:09:37,924 --> 01:09:40,882<br />
I didn't mean right now.<br />
You hate golf.<br />
<br />
785<br />
01:09:40,968 --> 01:09:43,835<br />
Well, it's my vacation, honey.<br />
I just wanted to get out of the house.<br />
<br />
786<br />
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:46,033<br />
I would think, after the week<br />
I put you through, you'd want to too.<br />
<br />
787<br />
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:49,845<br />
Why do I get the impression<br />
that you're trying to get rid of me?<br />
<br />
788<br />
01:09:49,936 --> 01:09:53,724<br />
I'm gonna be gone all day, hon. It'd be<br />
a good time for you to go see Evelyn.<br />
<br />
789<br />
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:55,521<br />
And you have a good time<br />
with the cousins.<br />
<br />
790<br />
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:59,226<br />
I hate them, dad.<br />
Rudy is a moron, and Diane smells.<br />
<br />
791<br />
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,811<br />
Have a nice weekend.<br />
<br />
792<br />
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:05,982<br />
I'll see you later.<br />
<br />
793<br />
01:10:09,455 --> 01:10:11,946<br />
Hey, Carol,<br />
see my new golf glove here?<br />
<br />
794<br />
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:14,077<br />
I got it so I don't get blisters<br />
playing golf.<br />
<br />
795<br />
01:10:14,168 --> 01:10:17,035<br />
We're gonna be playing<br />
that much golf. Really.<br />
<br />
796<br />
01:10:18,089 --> 01:10:19,795<br />
Fore!<br />
<br />
797<br />
01:10:20,299 --> 01:10:22,335<br />
Think she bought it?<br />
<br />
798<br />
01:10:32,353 --> 01:10:36,596<br />
Yo, Steve-man.<br />
Hey, what's the haps, dude?<br />
<br />
799<br />
01:10:36,691 --> 01:10:40,183<br />
You gotta come down here today.<br />
It's gonna be live.<br />
<br />
800<br />
01:10:40,278 --> 01:10:42,394<br />
No, you've got to.<br />
<br />
801<br />
01:10:42,488 --> 01:10:45,355<br />
Something's about to happen.<br />
I can't tell you.<br />
<br />
802<br />
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:53,995<br />
Are you sure you know<br />
what you're doing, art?<br />
<br />
803<br />
01:10:54,083 --> 01:10:56,061<br />
There's an awful lot of juice<br />
going through those wires.<br />
<br />
804<br />
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,076<br />
You hit the wrong one,<br />
you're a post toastie.<br />
<br />
805<br />
01:10:58,171 --> 01:11:00,287<br />
Ray, electricity is our friend.<br />
<br />
806<br />
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:02,341<br />
Besides, we wanna take out<br />
their alarms, don't we?<br />
<br />
807<br />
01:11:02,383 --> 01:11:06,592<br />
I was thinking maybe we could bypass the<br />
fence altogether and find another way in.<br />
<br />
808<br />
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,045<br />
No one knows how many trip alarms<br />
they have in there.<br />
<br />
809<br />
01:11:09,140 --> 01:11:12,678<br />
No, no, I can take out everything<br />
they've got with one clip of the snips.<br />
<br />
810<br />
01:11:12,769 --> 01:11:15,135<br />
- Right, captain?<br />
- Affirmative.<br />
<br />
811<br />
01:11:18,441 --> 01:11:21,729<br />
Siren mode. Pretty neat, eh?<br />
<br />
812<br />
01:11:23,112 --> 01:11:25,478<br />
You know, I can raise<br />
all the police channels...<br />
<br />
813<br />
01:11:25,573 --> 01:11:27,734<br />
And the power company channels<br />
on this baby.<br />
<br />
814<br />
01:11:27,825 --> 01:11:30,658<br />
- Now be careful up there, art.<br />
- It's okay, ray. I'll get it.<br />
<br />
815<br />
01:11:30,745 --> 01:11:34,283<br />
We gotta get going though.<br />
We're burning daylight here.<br />
<br />
816<br />
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:41,123<br />
Hey, where should we start diggin'<br />
once we get over there?<br />
<br />
817<br />
01:11:41,214 --> 01:11:45,173<br />
We start in the backyard,<br />
then check the basement.<br />
<br />
818<br />
01:11:45,259 --> 01:11:47,966<br />
Be careful up there.<br />
Go slow, huh?<br />
<br />
819<br />
01:11:48,054 --> 01:11:50,716<br />
Hey, safety is my middle name.<br />
<br />
820<br />
01:11:51,390 --> 01:11:54,132<br />
I thought<br />
his middle name was Louis.<br />
<br />
821<br />
01:11:55,311 --> 01:11:58,428<br />
Are you sure you're<br />
alright up there?<br />
<br />
822<br />
01:11:58,523 --> 01:12:00,434<br />
I don't know<br />
that he knows what he's doing.<br />
<br />
823<br />
01:12:00,525 --> 01:12:03,358<br />
Well, why didn't you<br />
go up there?<br />
<br />
824<br />
01:12:03,444 --> 01:12:05,685<br />
It's very high.<br />
<br />
825<br />
01:12:16,666 --> 01:12:18,122<br />
Oh, Jesus!<br />
<br />
826<br />
01:12:19,418 --> 01:12:22,956<br />
Jesus Christ!<br />
Get an ambulance on that thing!<br />
<br />
827<br />
01:12:25,800 --> 01:12:28,041<br />
I'm okay. I'm alright.<br />
<br />
828<br />
01:12:29,262 --> 01:12:30,843<br />
God!<br />
<br />
829<br />
01:12:33,140 --> 01:12:34,676<br />
I took a jolt, but I'm okay.<br />
<br />
830<br />
01:12:34,767 --> 01:12:36,537<br />
- Can you stand up? Use your legs?<br />
- Oh, yeah.<br />
<br />
831<br />
01:12:36,561 --> 01:12:40,224<br />
- Try one of these.<br />
- Oh, yeah, that's better.<br />
<br />
832<br />
01:12:40,314 --> 01:12:43,272<br />
- Whoa, whoa.<br />
- No, no, no. Jesus.<br />
<br />
833<br />
01:12:44,861 --> 01:12:48,319<br />
Look at my fingers.<br />
My fingernails are black.<br />
<br />
834<br />
01:12:50,408 --> 01:12:53,320<br />
- My fillings are hot.<br />
- Hey, look at this.<br />
<br />
835<br />
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:57,154<br />
The man actually hit the right wire!<br />
There's no alarm!<br />
<br />
836<br />
01:12:57,248 --> 01:13:00,957<br />
- Hey, good work.<br />
- Congratulations. Now give me five.<br />
<br />
837<br />
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:05,002<br />
- I'm gonna set up a communications base.<br />
- You got it.<br />
<br />
838<br />
01:13:05,089 --> 01:13:09,298<br />
- Here, you're gonna need this.<br />
- Here... here.<br />
<br />
839<br />
01:13:33,534 --> 01:13:37,743<br />
Hey, hey, hey, rumsfield! Dude!<br />
What are you doing with the gun?<br />
<br />
840<br />
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:41,448<br />
Just shut up<br />
and paint your goddamn house!<br />
<br />
841<br />
01:13:43,294 --> 01:13:44,329<br />
Fine...<br />
<br />
842<br />
01:13:49,717 --> 01:13:53,050<br />
Task force one,<br />
this is eagle eye.<br />
<br />
843<br />
01:13:53,137 --> 01:13:56,004<br />
You are all clear.<br />
<br />
844<br />
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,300<br />
Roger, eagle eye.<br />
We're going over.<br />
<br />
845<br />
01:14:00,394 --> 01:14:05,309<br />
Roger.<br />
Red rover, red rover, let ray go over.<br />
<br />
846<br />
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:12,354<br />
Good. Now, red rover, red rover,<br />
let art go on over.<br />
<br />
847<br />
01:14:16,786 --> 01:14:19,152<br />
That's great. Over.<br />
<br />
848<br />
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,206<br />
Man, it's really getting<br />
hot out here.<br />
<br />
849<br />
01:14:28,297 --> 01:14:31,585<br />
Yeah.<br />
Yeah, it is getting hot, art.<br />
<br />
850<br />
01:14:31,676 --> 01:14:35,669<br />
Why don't you dig one<br />
of your own holes, huh?<br />
<br />
851<br />
01:14:35,763 --> 01:14:39,506<br />
Well, I was just checking this one.<br />
Besides, the radio... I was monitoring...<br />
<br />
852<br />
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,764<br />
This is turning out to be a lot more work<br />
than we thought it was gonna be.<br />
<br />
853<br />
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:47,767<br />
Why don't we check the house?<br />
It's probably a lot cooler in there.<br />
<br />
854<br />
01:14:47,858 --> 01:14:50,440<br />
That's a good idea.<br />
Let's try the house.<br />
<br />
855<br />
01:14:50,528 --> 01:14:52,769<br />
We'll start in the basement.<br />
<br />
856<br />
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:56,818<br />
We'll start in the basement<br />
and just work our way up.<br />
<br />
857<br />
01:14:56,909 --> 01:15:00,993<br />
You know, ray, I'm thinking the reason<br />
we didn't find anything in the backyard...<br />
<br />
858<br />
01:15:01,080 --> 01:15:03,558<br />
Is because they probably<br />
weren't burying anybody in the backyard.<br />
<br />
859<br />
01:15:03,582 --> 01:15:07,666<br />
They were digging bodies up and they probably<br />
buried them in the basement of the house.<br />
<br />
860<br />
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:09,618<br />
That's a possibility, art.<br />
<br />
861<br />
01:15:09,714 --> 01:15:13,457<br />
I say we start in the kitchen.<br />
They probably got some cold beer in there.<br />
<br />
862<br />
01:15:13,551 --> 01:15:17,043<br />
Or some knockwurst or something.<br />
I'm starving.<br />
<br />
863<br />
01:15:17,138 --> 01:15:19,094<br />
It's locked.<br />
<br />
864<br />
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,348<br />
- Hey, give me a credit card.<br />
- Yeah.<br />
<br />
865<br />
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:44,946<br />
- Where did you learn how to do that?<br />
- I don't know how to do this.<br />
<br />
866<br />
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:50,876<br />
Ah, it's a shit store anyway.<br />
<br />
867<br />
01:15:56,052 --> 01:16:00,671<br />
Ray... ray, do the words "breaking<br />
and entering” mean anything to you?<br />
<br />
868<br />
01:16:02,141 --> 01:16:05,133<br />
Hey, Mr. rumsfield!<br />
<br />
869<br />
01:16:06,270 --> 01:16:09,262<br />
Hey, yo, man!<br />
I wanted to introduce you to my friend.<br />
<br />
870<br />
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:12,519<br />
- This is Steve kuntz.<br />
- Hey, dude.<br />
<br />
871<br />
01:16:12,610 --> 01:16:16,944<br />
- He's here to watch the show this afternoon.<br />
- Great...<br />
<br />
872<br />
01:16:57,571 --> 01:17:00,233<br />
It's about time, you guys.<br />
Hey, Ricky!<br />
<br />
873<br />
01:17:00,324 --> 01:17:03,612<br />
Hey, man,<br />
when's the big unveiling, huh?<br />
<br />
874<br />
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:09,413<br />
- Look, I gotta go to work in a couple hours.<br />
- Hey, man, piss off!<br />
<br />
875<br />
01:17:09,500 --> 01:17:10,956<br />
- Ricky!<br />
- Yo!<br />
<br />
876<br />
01:17:11,043 --> 01:17:14,752<br />
- Get this lame-o out of your yard!<br />
- Get out of my yard, lame-o!<br />
<br />
877<br />
01:17:14,839 --> 01:17:18,548<br />
- What's his problem?<br />
- Hey! Hey! Get out of my yard!<br />
<br />
878<br />
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:28,341<br />
Ray, look at the size<br />
of this furnace.<br />
<br />
879<br />
01:17:28,435 --> 01:17:31,142<br />
This thing's got to be<br />
80 years old.<br />
<br />
880<br />
01:17:31,230 --> 01:17:34,017<br />
These old places<br />
have got to be hell to heat, huh?<br />
<br />
881<br />
01:17:34,108 --> 01:17:36,645<br />
Well, this house isn't that big.<br />
<br />
882<br />
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:40,319<br />
What the hell does he need<br />
a furnace like this for?<br />
<br />
883<br />
01:17:41,532 --> 01:17:45,195<br />
I think there's been some modifications<br />
on this 'cause this conduit's brand new.<br />
<br />
884<br />
01:17:45,286 --> 01:17:48,098<br />
It runs all the way back over there<br />
and up through a hole in the ceiling.<br />
<br />
885<br />
01:17:48,122 --> 01:17:50,488<br />
I saw some of that<br />
in their living room.<br />
<br />
886<br />
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:53,416<br />
And a thermostat<br />
on a home furnace...<br />
<br />
887<br />
01:17:53,502 --> 01:17:55,993<br />
Is that supposed to go to 5,000 degrees,<br />
do you think?<br />
<br />
888<br />
01:17:56,088 --> 01:18:00,001<br />
It must be what all the noise was. Look at<br />
all the stuff they put together down here.<br />
<br />
889<br />
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:03,129<br />
- They got this place wired with batteries.<br />
- There's gotta be 40 of 'em.<br />
<br />
890<br />
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:06,007<br />
Look, we got power here.<br />
<br />
891<br />
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:25,981<br />
This is no ordinary furnace.<br />
<br />
892<br />
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:36,621<br />
What's that?<br />
<br />
893<br />
01:18:45,012 --> 01:18:47,128<br />
Yo, rumsfield!<br />
<br />
894<br />
01:18:53,103 --> 01:18:55,139<br />
Awesome!<br />
<br />
895<br />
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:58,309<br />
Mr. rumsfield, are you okay?<br />
<br />
896<br />
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:01,267<br />
- Yes, yes, I'm alright.<br />
- That was very cool, man.<br />
<br />
897<br />
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:05,230<br />
Art. Art, look!<br />
<br />
898<br />
01:19:05,324 --> 01:19:08,441<br />
- Look! I found it!<br />
- That's loose dirt.<br />
<br />
899<br />
01:19:08,535 --> 01:19:11,993<br />
They must have burned his body up<br />
in the furnace...<br />
<br />
900<br />
01:19:12,081 --> 01:19:16,370<br />
- And then buried his bones right here.<br />
- What do we do now?<br />
<br />
901<br />
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,566<br />
I'll tell him that<br />
they built a crematorium down here.<br />
<br />
902<br />
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,652<br />
No, don't tell him that.<br />
He'll just want to come down.<br />
<br />
903<br />
01:19:23,676 --> 01:19:28,386<br />
- Just wait 'til we find something.<br />
- Ray, that could take all night.<br />
<br />
904<br />
01:19:34,019 --> 01:19:38,558<br />
Mr. rumsfield, you guys managed<br />
to knock out the power in the entire block.<br />
<br />
905<br />
01:19:38,649 --> 01:19:43,018<br />
- Probably the whole south end of town.<br />
- Ricky, shut up!<br />
<br />
906<br />
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:46,696<br />
Hey Rick! Listen, man.<br />
We're gonna make a run to mcd's.<br />
<br />
907<br />
01:19:46,782 --> 01:19:49,444<br />
- You want a quarterpounder or something?<br />
- Hey, no way!<br />
<br />
908<br />
01:19:49,535 --> 01:19:52,242<br />
Hey, wait, you guys can't go now.<br />
It's the best part.<br />
<br />
909<br />
01:19:52,329 --> 01:19:55,492<br />
- I called the pizza dude.<br />
- Alright!<br />
<br />
910<br />
01:20:25,738 --> 01:20:28,696<br />
Ray, I think we can give up.<br />
They'd never bury him this deep.<br />
<br />
911<br />
01:20:28,782 --> 01:20:34,698<br />
Who, besides us, would dig this deep<br />
into this kind of sludge?<br />
<br />
912<br />
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:39,490<br />
- That was metal! That was metal! You hit a crypt!<br />
- Hey!<br />
<br />
913<br />
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:45,171<br />
They buried him in a crypt! I'll get my<br />
blowtorch! I'll call it in! I'll call it in!<br />
<br />
914<br />
01:20:45,257 --> 01:20:49,921<br />
Hello! Hey, uh...<br />
Eagle eye, this is ground force one.<br />
<br />
915<br />
01:20:50,012 --> 01:20:53,504<br />
We have found Walter! We found Walter!<br />
I'll be out in a minute!<br />
<br />
916<br />
01:20:53,599 --> 01:20:57,217<br />
Dig there! Dig there!<br />
Oh, yes! We found him!<br />
<br />
917<br />
01:20:59,563 --> 01:21:01,770<br />
We caught you, reub.<br />
<br />
918<br />
01:21:01,857 --> 01:21:05,315<br />
You've been playing us for saps,<br />
but you were wrong.<br />
<br />
919<br />
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,606<br />
Mr. weingartner! Art!<br />
<br />
920<br />
01:21:50,697 --> 01:21:54,110<br />
Look! Look over there!<br />
Look! Right now!<br />
<br />
921<br />
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:03,286<br />
Go on. Go on. T'll...<br />
<br />
922<br />
01:22:04,503 --> 01:22:06,414<br />
Walter!<br />
<br />
923<br />
01:22:09,675 --> 01:22:12,417<br />
Let me go. I'm alright.<br />
<br />
924<br />
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:15,844<br />
Ray! Raymond!<br />
<br />
925<br />
01:22:16,849 --> 01:22:19,261<br />
Listen up real carefully,<br />
mister.<br />
<br />
926<br />
01:22:19,351 --> 01:22:21,637<br />
We got a real problem.<br />
<br />
927<br />
01:22:21,728 --> 01:22:25,220<br />
Hey, ray, guess who's not in the basement!<br />
Walter!<br />
<br />
928<br />
01:22:25,315 --> 01:22:27,897<br />
He's back! He's back!<br />
<br />
929<br />
01:22:35,075 --> 01:22:38,158<br />
Klopeks! With coppers!<br />
<br />
930<br />
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:42,988<br />
Keep 'em busy. Keep 'em busy.<br />
I'll get ray.<br />
<br />
931<br />
01:22:43,083 --> 01:22:46,041<br />
- Keep them busy!<br />
- Alright, okay, alright!<br />
<br />
932<br />
01:22:46,128 --> 01:22:49,746<br />
Stop! Stop right there!<br />
Don't go any further!<br />
<br />
933<br />
01:22:50,424 --> 01:22:52,665<br />
You're going! Stop!<br />
<br />
934<br />
01:22:54,136 --> 01:22:55,546<br />
Hey!<br />
<br />
935<br />
01:22:56,263 --> 01:22:57,753<br />
Mr. officer, wait.<br />
<br />
936<br />
01:22:57,848 --> 01:23:01,807<br />
There are these people in my parents' house<br />
and they're eating all their food!<br />
<br />
937<br />
01:23:09,109 --> 01:23:10,394<br />
Ray, Walter showed up!<br />
<br />
938<br />
01:23:10,486 --> 01:23:14,604<br />
- And the klopeks! I got Ricky down there...<br />
- I hit the gas line! Run!<br />
<br />
939<br />
01:23:14,698 --> 01:23:17,110<br />
- Gas!<br />
- Run!<br />
<br />
940<br />
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:19,241<br />
- What is the problem here?<br />
- Thank god you're here.<br />
<br />
941<br />
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:20,555<br />
- No problem, sir.<br />
- This is not a police matter.<br />
<br />
942<br />
01:23:20,579 --> 01:23:22,194<br />
There have been some intruders!<br />
<br />
943<br />
01:23:22,289 --> 01:23:24,621<br />
We hit a pipe!<br />
There's all kinds of gas!<br />
<br />
944<br />
01:23:24,708 --> 01:23:25,868<br />
It's gonna blow!<br />
<br />
945<br />
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:34,457<br />
- Alright!<br />
- Man, Ricky sure knows how to throw a party.<br />
<br />
946<br />
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:07,364<br />
Was that your house?<br />
<br />
947<br />
01:24:15,676 --> 01:24:17,382<br />
Ray...<br />
<br />
948<br />
01:24:23,225 --> 01:24:25,682<br />
Something is moving in there.<br />
<br />
949<br />
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:07,178<br />
Ray... ray, you found it, right?<br />
Before it blew, you found it, right?<br />
<br />
950<br />
01:25:07,269 --> 01:25:10,477<br />
Hey, tell me you found it!<br />
You found it, right?<br />
<br />
951<br />
01:25:10,564 --> 01:25:14,182<br />
Before everything went off,<br />
you had to have found it!<br />
<br />
952<br />
01:25:15,736 --> 01:25:18,318<br />
You got a lawsuit<br />
on your hands, mister.<br />
<br />
953<br />
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:24,445<br />
Oh, god, what's this?<br />
<br />
954<br />
01:25:44,348 --> 01:25:46,430<br />
Your attention, please.<br />
<br />
955<br />
01:25:47,017 --> 01:25:49,759<br />
Please stay behind the barricade.<br />
<br />
956<br />
01:26:00,238 --> 01:26:03,384<br />
- I live here. That's my house.<br />
- Sorry, I've got to get the all clear from the gas company.<br />
<br />
957<br />
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:05,553<br />
Excuse me, I can clear this.<br />
This is Mrs. Peterson. She lives here.<br />
<br />
958<br />
01:26:05,577 --> 01:26:09,161<br />
- Did I ask you?<br />
- Miss, you wanna come back here, please?<br />
<br />
959<br />
01:26:09,247 --> 01:26:12,284<br />
Excuse me, pal.<br />
Maybe I didn't make myself clear enough.<br />
<br />
960<br />
01:26:12,876 --> 01:26:14,412<br />
Hey!<br />
<br />
961<br />
01:26:24,179 --> 01:26:28,798<br />
- Oh, honey, what have they done to you?<br />
- You cut your hair.<br />
<br />
962<br />
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:33,851<br />
I like it.<br />
<br />
963<br />
01:26:33,939 --> 01:26:36,476<br />
I'm telling you, officer,<br />
there's a body buried in that house.<br />
<br />
964<br />
01:26:36,566 --> 01:26:39,566<br />
- The old man, Mr. seznick, right?<br />
- Yeah, the old guy who's sitting here...<br />
<br />
965<br />
01:26:39,611 --> 01:26:42,068<br />
- Is buried in that house, Sherlock.<br />
- Watch it.<br />
<br />
966<br />
01:26:42,155 --> 01:26:44,020<br />
Hey, where was he anyway?<br />
<br />
967<br />
01:26:44,116 --> 01:26:47,108<br />
Mr. seznick was at the hospital<br />
'til 8:00 this evening.<br />
<br />
968<br />
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:49,989<br />
Seems that Monday night,<br />
he had some heart palpitations.<br />
<br />
969<br />
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:54,414<br />
So he called his daughter and son-in-law,<br />
and they took him to the hospital.<br />
<br />
970<br />
01:26:54,501 --> 01:26:58,119<br />
What about the wig?<br />
They found a wig in this house.<br />
<br />
971<br />
01:26:58,213 --> 01:27:00,441<br />
- His wig!<br />
- The klopeks were picking up his mail for him.<br />
<br />
972<br />
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:04,834<br />
Seems the doctor somehow got that wig<br />
mixed up with the newspapers and letters.<br />
<br />
973<br />
01:27:04,928 --> 01:27:09,012<br />
"Doctor"? You don't believe that<br />
this guy's a real doctor, do you? Come on!<br />
<br />
974<br />
01:27:09,099 --> 01:27:10,555<br />
Yes, I do believe he's a doctor.<br />
<br />
975<br />
01:27:10,642 --> 01:27:14,055<br />
In fact, he's a very well-respected<br />
pathologist, my friend.<br />
<br />
976<br />
01:27:14,146 --> 01:27:18,139<br />
And I'd say that you are damn lucky<br />
you didn't kill him in that blast.<br />
<br />
977<br />
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,225<br />
Oh, yeah,<br />
I thank my lucky stars.<br />
<br />
978<br />
01:27:22,154 --> 01:27:26,989<br />
- Take care of this nitwit.<br />
- Hey, sorry about your car, man.<br />
<br />
979<br />
01:27:27,075 --> 01:27:31,239<br />
Destruction of private property.<br />
Destruction of public property.<br />
<br />
980<br />
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:34,412<br />
Three counts<br />
of criminal trespassing.<br />
<br />
981<br />
01:27:34,499 --> 01:27:38,617<br />
Harassment, assault, vandalism!<br />
<br />
982<br />
01:27:38,712 --> 01:27:41,579<br />
And that poor old man claims<br />
he's got a ransom note...<br />
<br />
983<br />
01:27:41,673 --> 01:27:44,710<br />
That says you kidnapped his dog!<br />
<br />
984<br />
01:27:46,636 --> 01:27:49,093<br />
Do you hear me okay,<br />
Mr. Peterson?<br />
<br />
985<br />
01:27:51,725 --> 01:27:54,683<br />
I really do like your hair, honey.<br />
<br />
986<br />
01:27:56,188 --> 01:27:57,894<br />
You know,<br />
this doesn't change a thing.<br />
<br />
987<br />
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,960<br />
They may think it does. They may think<br />
they're off the hook, but they're not.<br />
<br />
988<br />
01:28:00,984 --> 01:28:03,566<br />
No, they're not. Are they, ray?<br />
Go ahead, tell 'em.<br />
<br />
989<br />
01:28:03,653 --> 01:28:05,439<br />
Tell 'em.<br />
We got the goods on 'em, don't we?<br />
<br />
990<br />
01:28:05,530 --> 01:28:08,397<br />
Someday they're gonna dig up<br />
the back of that yard...<br />
<br />
991<br />
01:28:08,492 --> 01:28:10,887<br />
And they're gonna find the rest<br />
of that skeleton to go with that femur.<br />
<br />
992<br />
01:28:10,911 --> 01:28:15,075<br />
- It might not be Walter, but it's gonna be...<br />
- Shut up, art! Shut up!<br />
<br />
993<br />
01:28:15,165 --> 01:28:18,328<br />
God, you don't know<br />
when to quit, do you?<br />
<br />
994<br />
01:28:18,794 --> 01:28:20,830<br />
Look at me!<br />
<br />
995<br />
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:24,375<br />
I'm a shell of a man<br />
because of you, art.<br />
<br />
996<br />
01:28:25,342 --> 01:28:27,082<br />
- Now, now...<br />
- Soldiers!<br />
<br />
997<br />
01:28:27,177 --> 01:28:30,761<br />
You leave 'em alone!<br />
Get off their case already!<br />
<br />
998<br />
01:28:30,847 --> 01:28:35,216<br />
They didn't do anything to us.<br />
They didn't do anything to us!<br />
<br />
999<br />
01:28:35,310 --> 01:28:38,552<br />
Alright, so they're different!<br />
So they keep to themselves!<br />
<br />
1000<br />
01:28:38,647 --> 01:28:42,105<br />
Can you blame them? They live next door<br />
to people who break into their house...<br />
<br />
1001<br />
01:28:42,192 --> 01:28:44,854<br />
And burn it down<br />
while they're gone for the day!<br />
<br />
1002<br />
01:28:46,279 --> 01:28:50,067<br />
Remember what you were saying<br />
about people in the 'burbs, art?<br />
<br />
1003<br />
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,989<br />
People like skip?<br />
<br />
1004<br />
01:28:52,077 --> 01:28:57,663<br />
People who mow their lawn<br />
for the 800th time and then snap?<br />
<br />
1005<br />
01:28:57,749 --> 01:29:00,991<br />
Well, that's us!<br />
It's not them! That's us!<br />
<br />
1006<br />
01:29:01,086 --> 01:29:05,796<br />
We're the ones vaulting over fences<br />
and peeking in through people's windows!<br />
<br />
1007<br />
01:29:05,882 --> 01:29:10,376<br />
We're the ones throwing garbage<br />
in the street and lighting fires!<br />
<br />
1008<br />
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:13,212<br />
We're the ones who are acting suspicious<br />
and paranoid, art!<br />
<br />
1009<br />
01:29:13,306 --> 01:29:17,845<br />
We're the lunatics! Us!<br />
It's not them!<br />
<br />
1010<br />
01:29:19,271 --> 01:29:21,478<br />
It's us.<br />
<br />
1011<br />
01:29:26,278 --> 01:29:30,112<br />
I don't know what to say.<br />
What, do you want me to move?<br />
<br />
1012<br />
01:29:34,035 --> 01:29:37,277<br />
- I'm gonna kill him!<br />
- You're crazy!<br />
<br />
1013<br />
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:41,160<br />
- Back off! Back off!<br />
- Stop it! Stop it!<br />
<br />
1014<br />
01:29:42,252 --> 01:29:44,288<br />
Break it up!<br />
<br />
1015<br />
01:29:44,796 --> 01:29:47,833<br />
- Stop it! Stop it!<br />
- I don't care! I've been blown up!<br />
<br />
1016<br />
01:29:47,924 --> 01:29:50,040<br />
Take me to the hospital!<br />
<br />
1017<br />
01:29:50,135 --> 01:29:52,877<br />
Take me to a hospital, I'm sick.<br />
<br />
1018<br />
01:29:52,971 --> 01:29:54,836<br />
My eye...<br />
<br />
1019<br />
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:11,820<br />
Honey? I'll just find out<br />
what hospital they're taking you to...<br />
<br />
1020<br />
01:30:11,907 --> 01:30:15,525<br />
And then t'll...<br />
Follow right along.<br />
<br />
1021<br />
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:17,610<br />
- Okay?<br />
- Okay, honey.<br />
<br />
1022<br />
01:30:18,914 --> 01:30:21,826<br />
- You okay?<br />
- Yeah, I'm fine, Carol.<br />
<br />
1023<br />
01:30:31,551 --> 01:30:34,839<br />
Okay, hepcats, get off my car!<br />
<br />
1024<br />
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,199<br />
- You know, dude, you should hang out a little bit.<br />
- Get off my car!<br />
<br />
1025<br />
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:40,681<br />
- This goes for you!<br />
- Chill out with us! We've got the pizza dude coming!<br />
<br />
1026<br />
01:30:40,769 --> 01:30:43,476<br />
You imbecile!<br />
You sub-moron, you!<br />
<br />
1027<br />
01:30:46,149 --> 01:30:48,435<br />
Who's that?<br />
<br />
1028<br />
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,811<br />
Oh, Dr. klopek...<br />
<br />
1029<br />
01:30:53,448 --> 01:30:55,689<br />
I'm so sorry.<br />
<br />
1030<br />
01:30:55,784 --> 01:31:00,778<br />
You know, Dr. klopek, when I get out of prison,<br />
I'm gonna help you rebuild your house.<br />
<br />
1031<br />
01:31:00,872 --> 01:31:04,410<br />
I'll even do some of the work myself.<br />
I have the tools.<br />
<br />
1032<br />
01:31:04,501 --> 01:31:07,834<br />
Carol's father just gave me<br />
a brand new set of tools.<br />
<br />
1033<br />
01:31:07,921 --> 01:31:11,209<br />
Do I look like an idiot,<br />
Mr. Peterson?<br />
<br />
1034<br />
01:31:12,884 --> 01:31:17,503<br />
- No...<br />
- Do you take me for an imbecile?<br />
<br />
1035<br />
01:31:19,140 --> 01:31:20,380<br />
No...<br />
<br />
1036<br />
01:31:20,475 --> 01:31:25,185<br />
You may have fooled the others,<br />
Mr. Peterson...<br />
<br />
1037<br />
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:27,102<br />
But you don't fool me.<br />
<br />
1038<br />
01:31:28,608 --> 01:31:30,724<br />
Uh, I fooled the others?<br />
<br />
1039<br />
01:31:30,819 --> 01:31:34,027<br />
- But you don't fool me.<br />
- I don't?<br />
<br />
1040<br />
01:31:34,114 --> 01:31:37,106<br />
No, you don't.<br />
<br />
1041<br />
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:39,612<br />
Am I missing something here,<br />
doctor?<br />
<br />
1042<br />
01:31:39,703 --> 01:31:44,697<br />
Come now, Mr. Peterson.<br />
You were in my basement.<br />
<br />
1043<br />
01:31:44,791 --> 01:31:49,034<br />
Surely, you looked in the furnace.<br />
<br />
1044<br />
01:31:50,755 --> 01:31:54,122<br />
I saw your furnace, doctor...<br />
<br />
1045<br />
01:31:54,217 --> 01:31:58,836<br />
But I figured a man's furnace<br />
is his own business.<br />
<br />
1046<br />
01:32:00,098 --> 01:32:04,182<br />
You saw one of my skulls,<br />
didn't you?<br />
<br />
1047<br />
01:32:04,269 --> 01:32:06,931<br />
Oh, yes. I know you did.<br />
<br />
1048<br />
01:32:07,897 --> 01:32:10,980<br />
It belonged<br />
to a neighbor of yours.<br />
<br />
1049<br />
01:32:11,651 --> 01:32:15,189<br />
The name was knapp.<br />
<br />
1050<br />
01:32:16,114 --> 01:32:18,730<br />
We took the house from them.<br />
<br />
1051<br />
01:32:19,284 --> 01:32:23,948<br />
I offered to buy it,<br />
but you know how old people are.<br />
<br />
1052<br />
01:32:24,039 --> 01:32:28,123<br />
They grow so attached to things.<br />
<br />
1053<br />
01:32:28,209 --> 01:32:31,918<br />
Uh, you know, Dr. klopek,<br />
I think I forgot my wallet.<br />
<br />
1054<br />
01:32:32,714 --> 01:32:35,456<br />
I let you keep the femur.<br />
<br />
1055<br />
01:32:35,550 --> 01:32:40,044<br />
Now... now, I want my skull.<br />
<br />
1056<br />
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:43,881<br />
Or, perhaps,<br />
I might just take yours.<br />
<br />
1057<br />
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:45,715<br />
Hans.<br />
<br />
1058<br />
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,766<br />
Uh, hey!<br />
<br />
1059<br />
01:33:17,801 --> 01:33:19,883<br />
Hey, the pizza dude!<br />
<br />
1060<br />
01:33:25,683 --> 01:33:27,594<br />
- Yeah! Way to go!<br />
- Alright!<br />
<br />
1061<br />
01:33:39,739 --> 01:33:41,570<br />
Far out!<br />
<br />
1062<br />
01:33:47,455 --> 01:33:50,663<br />
Citizen's arrest!<br />
Citizen's arrest!<br />
<br />
1063<br />
01:33:52,085 --> 01:33:58,832<br />
I, ray Peterson, am placing you under<br />
citizen's arrest for my attempted murder!<br />
<br />
1064<br />
01:33:58,925 --> 01:34:01,257<br />
The man doesn't know<br />
what he's talking about.<br />
<br />
1065<br />
01:34:01,344 --> 01:34:03,155<br />
- Citizen's arrest. Citizen's arrest.<br />
- Oh, ray.<br />
<br />
1066<br />
01:34:03,179 --> 01:34:06,019<br />
Don't start with me, Carol. The man<br />
confessed. They murdered the knapps.<br />
<br />
1067<br />
01:34:06,099 --> 01:34:08,090<br />
- He's demented.<br />
- Hey, Sherlock.<br />
<br />
1068<br />
01:34:08,184 --> 01:34:10,800<br />
Get the klopeks to tell you<br />
where they buried the stiffs, okay?<br />
<br />
1069<br />
01:34:10,895 --> 01:34:14,353<br />
You don't have a stiff.<br />
You don't have any evidence at all!<br />
<br />
1070<br />
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:15,930<br />
You do now.<br />
<br />
1071<br />
01:34:27,579 --> 01:34:30,195<br />
This your vehicle, Dr. klopek?<br />
<br />
1072<br />
01:34:33,585 --> 01:34:35,667<br />
Let's go, doc.<br />
<br />
1073<br />
01:34:36,296 --> 01:34:39,709<br />
Hey! Pinocchio!<br />
<br />
1074<br />
01:34:40,466 --> 01:34:42,422<br />
Where are you going?<br />
<br />
1075<br />
01:34:47,015 --> 01:34:49,176<br />
Gotcha!<br />
<br />
1076<br />
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,850<br />
Don't you make a move, Sonny.<br />
<br />
1077<br />
01:34:56,941 --> 01:35:01,776<br />
I was 18 months in the bush,<br />
and I can snap your neck in a heartbeat.<br />
<br />
1078<br />
01:35:01,863 --> 01:35:05,105<br />
I think the message<br />
to psychos, fanatics, murderers...<br />
<br />
1079<br />
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:07,236<br />
Hutcases<br />
all over the world is, uh...<br />
<br />
1080<br />
01:35:07,327 --> 01:35:11,661<br />
Do not mess with suburbanites because, uh,<br />
frankly, we're not gonna take it anymore.<br />
<br />
1081<br />
01:35:11,748 --> 01:35:13,726<br />
We're not gonna be content<br />
to look after our lawns...<br />
<br />
1082<br />
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,581<br />
And wax our cars,<br />
paint our houses.<br />
<br />
1083<br />
01:35:15,668 --> 01:35:18,660<br />
We're out to get 'em, Don.<br />
We are out to get them.<br />
<br />
1084<br />
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,132<br />
- Hello.<br />
- Hi.<br />
<br />
1085<br />
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:30,714<br />
So, what are you gonna do now?<br />
<br />
1086<br />
01:35:30,808 --> 01:35:34,847<br />
I'm gonna pack a bag<br />
and go up to the lake.<br />
<br />
1087<br />
01:35:35,480 --> 01:35:37,562<br />
We got 'em, neighbor.<br />
<br />
1088<br />
01:35:38,149 --> 01:35:41,687<br />
- Get away from him.<br />
- Hey, you guys!<br />
<br />
1089<br />
01:35:41,778 --> 01:35:45,020<br />
You wanna go down to bowl-0-rama<br />
for a beer or something?<br />
<br />
1090<br />
01:35:45,114 --> 01:35:47,446<br />
Man, that was an incredible choke hold<br />
you put on me, pal.<br />
<br />
1091<br />
01:35:47,533 --> 01:35:50,525<br />
Carol, the guy's a brute.<br />
How's that finger? Is it okay?<br />
<br />
1092<br />
01:35:50,620 --> 01:35:52,781<br />
Where are you guys going?<br />
Where you going?<br />
<br />
1093<br />
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:54,988<br />
Going on vacation.<br />
<br />
1094<br />
01:35:55,625 --> 01:35:59,834<br />
"Vacation"? What, are you crazy?<br />
This is a major media event here.<br />
<br />
1095<br />
01:35:59,921 --> 01:36:03,960<br />
Geraldo Rivera's coming, and he's gonna<br />
excavate the basement of the klopeks!<br />
<br />
1096<br />
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:08,419<br />
It's gonna be broadcast<br />
on satellite all over the world, live!<br />
<br />
1097<br />
01:36:08,513 --> 01:36:10,219<br />
Art!<br />
<br />
1098<br />
01:36:10,306 --> 01:36:12,592<br />
Your wife's home!<br />
<br />
1099<br />
01:36:13,351 --> 01:36:17,845<br />
- And your house is on fire!<br />
- Art, where are you?<br />
<br />
1100<br />
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:22,979<br />
- My wife is home!<br />
- Mr. Peterson, where you going?<br />
<br />
1101<br />
01:36:23,069 --> 01:36:25,685<br />
It's just starting to get good.<br />
<br />
1102<br />
01:36:26,322 --> 01:36:28,859<br />
I'm going away<br />
for a while, Ricky.<br />
<br />
1103<br />
01:36:32,078 --> 01:36:35,821<br />
I want you to keep an eye<br />
on the neighborhood for me.<br />
<br />
1104<br />
01:36:35,915 --> 01:36:38,622<br />
You betcha, Mr. Peterson.<br />
<br />
1105<br />
01:36:38,710 --> 01:36:40,826<br />
No problem.<br />
<br />
1106<br />
01:36:57,478 --> 01:36:59,969<br />
God, I love this street.<br />
<br />
